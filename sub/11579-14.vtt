Couldn't have
been here very Iong.
It's still in one piece.

00:37.070 --> 00:39.561
Could have broken down
and the owner went for help.

in the ignition?
Who's going to do that?

called Quantum,
up in Westchester.

03:26.673 --> 03:27.935

walked out of the office

03:28.007 --> 03:29.668

and nobody noticed.

a 10-week course
costs about $25,000.

isn't about the drugs,

03:51.598 --> 03:53.498
what was she doing
under the West Side Highway?

03:53.566 --> 03:55.625
Could be she was supposed
to meet a buyer there

03:55.702 --> 03:57.932
and some random predator
got to her first.

03:58.004 --> 04:00.495
Buyer shows up,
finds the body,

What kind of research?
Squamous cell
esophageal cancer.

04:34.574 --> 04:36.735
Is that something
your company's
working on alone?

04:36.809 --> 04:38.640
No. There's a drug
on the market called Rytex,

04:38.711 --> 04:41.509
but we believe that ours
will be more efficacious.

04:41.581 --> 04:44.015
When did you Iast see
Miss Grace?

04:45.118 --> 04:48.178
Last night, around 8:00.

04:49.489 --> 04:52.424
She said that
she was finishing up.

04:52.759 --> 04:54.693
I assumed that she was
heading home from here.

04:54.761 --> 04:57.229
It's a Iong commute
to Manhattan, Mr. Ragolia.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.162
She always drive?

04:59.832 --> 05:03.359
Paula always said
that it was the best
part of her day,

05:03.436 --> 05:05.199
her chance to
clear her head.

05:05.271 --> 05:06.966
That's why she would
never move up here.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.406
Does she have any family,
a boyfriend?

05:09.475 --> 05:10.908
Both her parents are dead.

05:11.544 --> 05:13.444
She never mentioned
anyone special.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.178
She mostly kept
to herself at work.

05:16.282 --> 05:21.049
I insisted that she spend
the holidays with me,
my wife and my kids.

05:21.254 --> 05:23.279
Sounds Iike you
really took her
under your wing.

05:23.356 --> 05:26.689
In this business,
nurturing talent
can make you billions.

05:26.759 --> 05:30.490
Paula was on her way
to a very bright future here.

05:31.230 --> 05:33.027
What a waste.

05:33.700 --> 05:37.261
Your victim
has vaginal bruising
and Iacerations from the rape.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.601
No semen,
just Rough Rider.

05:40.673 --> 05:44.734
I ID'd the brand
of condom Iubricant
using the FBI database.

05:44.811 --> 05:46.005
What about the rock?

05:46.079 --> 05:49.378
Embedded in the ground,
but definitely
what killed her.

05:49.515 --> 05:53.246
The trauma is
to the Iower right quadrant,
but with an upward impact.

05:53.319 --> 05:55.981
Fracture pattern of the skull
indicates one fatal blow,

05:56.055 --> 05:58.250
probably while she was
trying to fight him off.

05:58.324 --> 06:01.054
So if the perp
didn't hit her
with the rock,

06:01.127 --> 06:03.652
he may not have realized
why she suddenly
stopped resisting.

06:03.730 --> 06:06.164
She get a piece of him?
Just his clothes.

06:06.232 --> 06:09.030
Navy blue fibers
under her fingernails.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.899
AIready sent it to the Iab.

06:11.571 --> 06:14.768
I'm running the fibers now.
No prints in the car
other than hers.

on your hands?

something behind in my office.

06:18.945 --> 06:21.209
My son used to
Iove these, too.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.475
Used them to make
a model of your crime scene.

06:23.549 --> 06:26.279
Here's the car.
We found her clothes
over here.

06:26.352 --> 06:27.910
Nothing but garbage
around the body.

06:27.987 --> 06:29.477
Any idea
how the perp got there?

06:29.555 --> 06:32.422
There were tire tracks
behind her car,
made by different tires.

06:32.492 --> 06:34.084
Goodyear radials, very worn.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.129
But what was in her trunk
is much more interesting.

06:37.196 --> 06:38.561
FIN: The Rytex?

06:39.232 --> 06:41.496
I tested it. It's fake.

06:42.001 --> 06:44.663
A million dollars worth
of sugar pills? Why?

06:44.737 --> 06:46.466
Drug counterfeiting
is a booming industry.

06:46.539 --> 06:49.030
Huge amounts
of fake antibiotics have
been sold over the Internet

06:49.108 --> 06:50.200
and at Mexican pharmacies.

06:50.276 --> 06:52.870
What about these?
High grade knock-offs.

06:52.945 --> 06:55.743
Look Iike the real deal,
worthless for treating cancer.

06:55.815 --> 06:57.976
But worth a hell of a Iot
to Paula.

07:02.288 --> 07:03.414
BENSON: Nice place.

07:03.523 --> 07:07.789
I wonder how many
cancer patients had to die
so she could get these views.

07:07.994 --> 07:11.054
How Iong had Miss Grace
Iived here?
AImost a year.

07:11.130 --> 07:12.290
Nice Iady.

07:12.365 --> 07:14.026
Good tipper
at the holidays.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.492
What about boyfriends?
Visitors?

07:16.736 --> 07:18.397
None that I ever saw.

07:18.471 --> 07:22.168
But Miss Grace didn't
Iook Iike she had guys
knocking down her door.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.765
How much Ionger
is this going to take?

07:24.043 --> 07:25.476
You got a train to catch?

07:25.545 --> 07:27.979
Some prospective tenants
are coming to see the place.

07:28.047 --> 07:30.572
How about a Iittle respect?
The Iady's been dead
Iess than a day.

07:30.650 --> 07:32.777
She said
she was moving out.

07:33.553 --> 07:34.815
See for yourself.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.214
You have any idea
where she was moving?

07:38.291 --> 07:41.488
AII I know is the owners
called and said to start
showing the place.

07:41.561 --> 07:44.928
Gucci, Prada, Chanel,

07:45.498 --> 07:47.523
it's pretty pricey stuff
for a Iab tech.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.433
Living above her means.
You Iadies are all alike.

07:50.536 --> 07:52.697
Do you have a copy
of her Iease?
I don't think she had one.

07:52.772 --> 07:54.137
She knew the owners.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.640
BENSON: We're going
to need to talk to them.

07:55.708 --> 07:58.643
I'II get you the number.
Name's Ragolia, Mr. and Mrs.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.871
You seen either of them
around here recently?

08:01.948 --> 08:04.246
Mr. Ragolia,
about once a week.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.251
Said he was measuring
for renovations.

08:07.386 --> 08:10.446
How much of this
do you think
Mrs. Ragolia knows?

08:11.424 --> 08:13.756
It's terrible what happened
to Paula.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.623
How well
did you know her?

08:15.695 --> 08:17.390
She came for Thanksgiving
and Christmas

08:17.463 --> 08:18.623
the past two years.

08:18.698 --> 08:21.166
One of those introverted
science types.

08:21.267 --> 08:23.326
But you felt you could
trust her in your apartment.

08:23.402 --> 08:24.596
That was Kevin's idea.

08:24.670 --> 08:28.538
I was more concerned with
finding someone who could
afford $7,500 a month.

08:28.608 --> 08:30.735
That's a Iot on
a researcher's salary.

08:30.810 --> 08:34.302
Kevin said Paula had
family money she inherited
when her parents died.

08:34.380 --> 08:36.075
I think she went through
most of it.

08:36.148 --> 08:38.241
BENSON: Is that why
she was moving out?

08:38.317 --> 08:40.945
She told Kevin
she wanted to Iive
closer to the office.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.682
She could rent
a place up here for
a third of what she paid us,

08:43.756 --> 08:45.280
still have enough
Ieft over for a car.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.656
I thought
she had a car already.
Didn't she drive to work?

08:47.727 --> 08:51.527
No. Paula told me herself
she hated taking the train
every day.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.934
We checked
Paula Grace's financials.

08:56.002 --> 08:58.197
She never paid a nickel
in rent to Ragolia.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.670
Or chipped in
on the car she Ieased.

08:59.739 --> 09:01.764
Ragolia co-signed
and made all the payments.

09:01.841 --> 09:03.934
So she gets tired
of being a kept woman,

09:04.010 --> 09:06.171
he gets
jealous-soon-to-be-
ex-Iover's disease.

09:06.245 --> 09:07.542
Ragolia's wife
is a knockout.

09:07.613 --> 09:09.513
Why cheat on her with somebody
who Iooked Iike Paula Grace?

09:09.582 --> 09:11.982
Maybe she had
something else he wanted.

09:13.953 --> 09:15.978
Oh, I can't
wait to hear this.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.852
Your sympathy's
overwhelming.

09:17.957 --> 09:19.322
What happened to you?

09:19.392 --> 09:20.950
Skydiving. Hard Ianding.

09:21.027 --> 09:22.995
He said he wiped out
riding his friend's Harley.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.030
Yeah, and the only thing
he's riding now is a desk.

09:25.097 --> 09:26.962
Dump on the victim's
cell phone just came back.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.159
Let's find out
who she called.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.828
Sure, make the gimp
do the busywork.

09:31.203 --> 09:33.637
How much Ionger
is the trial?
Couple more days of testimony.

09:33.706 --> 09:36.004
You know, I got
a background check
on Paula Grace.

09:36.075 --> 09:38.305
Got a Bachelor's
from the Pennsylvania
College of Pharmacy,

09:38.377 --> 09:40.106
Master's in Biochemistry
from Cornell.

09:40.179 --> 09:42.238
So, why are the drugs
in the trunk fake?

09:42.315 --> 09:44.146
Industrial espionage?

09:44.216 --> 09:46.480
Well, if she's
acting as a spy for
the makers of Rytex,

09:46.552 --> 09:47.678
they're not paying her
too well.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.084
She has a Iittle
under $2,000

09:49.155 --> 09:50.679
in her combined
bank accounts.

09:50.756 --> 09:54.283
She's a mole, all right,
but for the good guys.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.759
Paula made two calls
Iast night.

09:55.828 --> 09:59.059
A short one to Ragolia,
and a very Iong one
to an unlisted number.

09:59.131 --> 10:01.565
I called the number.
It's our friends at the FBI.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.568
She's blowing the whistle
on her own company.

10:03.636 --> 10:05.866
Quantum's about to test
their version of Rytex.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.236
MUNCH: So they conspire
to undermine the competition.

10:08.307 --> 10:09.672
They sell fake Rytex

10:09.742 --> 10:12.336
under the table
at half price to
pharmacies around the country,

10:12.411 --> 10:13.844
knowing that
when the drug fails,

10:13.913 --> 10:15.346
doctors are going to
Iook for an alternative.

10:15.414 --> 10:17.143
They didn't count
on Paula Grace
going to the Feds

10:17.216 --> 10:18.706
with her trunk
full of evidence.

10:18.784 --> 10:21.776
Which gives Ragolia
a couple hundred million
reasons to shut her up.

10:21.854 --> 10:23.253
Bring him in.

10:24.423 --> 10:27.358
Thank you for coming in.
We just got a few things
we need to clear up.

10:27.426 --> 10:29.451
Anything I can do to help.

10:30.029 --> 10:33.260
It was...really
admirable of you,

10:33.332 --> 10:34.993
making Paula
a part of your family.

10:35.067 --> 10:37.627
Well, my wife's
just as responsible
for that as I am.

10:37.703 --> 10:40.171
She Iiked Paula a Iot.
Really?

10:40.439 --> 10:41.599
Then how come
she didn't know

10:41.674 --> 10:43.869
that you paid for
her apartment and her car?

10:45.277 --> 10:47.336
How dare you talk to
my wife behind my back?

10:47.413 --> 10:48.675
FIN: We don't need
your permission.

10:48.748 --> 10:51.308
We found enough fake Rytex
in the back of Paula's car

10:51.384 --> 10:53.284
to stock about
two dozen pharmacies.

10:53.352 --> 10:54.842
RAGOLIA: Fake Rytex?
Yeah.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.217
Why would I know
anything about that?

10:56.288 --> 10:57.949
No, you're not that smart,
are you?

10:58.024 --> 10:59.992
But Paula was.
That's why you seduced her.

11:00.059 --> 11:04.758
Big executive Iike yourself
interested in the mousy,
shy Iittle girl,

11:04.830 --> 11:07.264
paying for her apartment,
paying for her car,

11:07.333 --> 11:09.096
and she helps you out
with your Iittle scheme.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.693
What scheme?
FIN: Quantum's stock
is taking a dive

11:11.771 --> 11:16.105
while your promising
competition to Rytex
is 18 months behind schedule.

11:16.175 --> 11:19.474
BENSON: So you flood
the market with fake Rytex
to damage its reputation.

11:19.545 --> 11:22.412
Then, when your product
comes out, your company
rakes in all the profits.

11:22.481 --> 11:25.279
You were set to cash in,
till you find out
she was working for the Feds.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.443
What?

11:26.519 --> 11:28.077
She was on her way
to bring the fake Rytex,

11:28.154 --> 11:30.281
and you, to the FBI
when she was killed.

11:30.356 --> 11:33.018
I didn't kill her.
I needed her.

11:33.092 --> 11:34.923
Till you were done with her.

11:34.994 --> 11:37.224
She wanted me
to Ieave my wife.

11:37.296 --> 11:38.786
I said, "No way."

11:38.864 --> 11:42.425
Later, she called me.
Said she was going
to make me sorry.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.894
I didn't think
she'd go to the Feds.

11:47.173 --> 11:49.004
That's it
until I get my Iawyer.

11:55.314 --> 11:57.282
I wouldn't get
too comfortable.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.820
He Iawyered up.
We're handing Ragolia
off to the FBI.

12:02.888 --> 12:05.152
Paula Grace
was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.316
Another victim?

12:06.392 --> 12:09.384
Same area, same M.O.,
but this one
is still breathing.

12:09.462 --> 12:10.690
(SIGHING)

12:12.765 --> 12:14.960
Victim made the 911
from her cell phone.

12:15.034 --> 12:16.433
Couldn't get a word
out of her.

12:16.502 --> 12:19.596
Okay. We got it
from here. Thank you.
Thanks.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.309
Hi, I'm detective Benson.

12:25.377 --> 12:27.436
I'd Iike to ask you
a few questions.

12:27.513 --> 12:29.208
What's your name?

12:31.083 --> 12:33.677
Francesca Jesner.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.585
Can you tell me
what happened?

12:40.426 --> 12:42.758
He made me
get out of the car.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.624
I thought
he was going to kill me.

12:47.900 --> 12:51.392
Did you see his face?
Not really.

12:52.071 --> 12:54.335
How about
what he was wearing?

12:56.208 --> 12:58.802
It was a blue uniform.

13:01.213 --> 13:03.204
He was a cop.

13:11.257 --> 13:15.591
A client of mine
had a party at Lucio's.

13:16.395 --> 13:19.592
I was driving home
when the cop pulled me over.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.394
Tell me
what happened next.

13:25.070 --> 13:27.402
He walked up to my window

13:27.606 --> 13:31.770
and shined a Iight in my eyes,
so I couldn't see him.

13:33.145 --> 13:36.603
He said I was weaving
and asked for my Iicense.

13:37.950 --> 13:41.716
Then he made me get out
and take a breathalyzer.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.816
Had you been drinking?
No.

13:47.159 --> 13:50.322
He said that if I would
have sex with him,

13:51.730 --> 13:53.322
he wouldn't arrest me.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.698
When I refused, he got angry.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.901
So I pretended to pass out.

14:04.376 --> 14:07.504
(SOBBING)
He dragged me from the car

14:07.880 --> 14:10.872
and said that
he knew I was faking,

14:11.150 --> 14:13.311
and that he was going
to kill me.

14:16.222 --> 14:17.814
So I Iet him.

14:21.227 --> 14:23.821
During the attack,
did he say anything?

14:25.164 --> 14:26.529
Nothing.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.664
What did the car Iook Iike?

14:31.804 --> 14:36.901
Unmarked.
Had a red Iight
on the dashboard.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.573
It was a dark color.

14:40.346 --> 14:42.246
Dark blue or black.

14:44.383 --> 14:48.376
Francesca, is there
anything else that you can
remember? Anything at all?

14:51.624 --> 14:53.285
He used a condom.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.389
This is really,
really important.

14:58.964 --> 15:01.592
Do you remember
what he did with the wrapper?

15:01.667 --> 15:03.760
He put it in his pocket.

15:04.937 --> 15:08.737
I remember thinking,
"Why would he keep that?"

15:10.542 --> 15:14.535
Oh, my God. He kept
my driver's Iicense, too.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.940
He knows where I Iive.

15:19.518 --> 15:20.883
How's Francesca's rape kit?

15:20.953 --> 15:24.013
It Iooked clean,
but we got a problem
with her blood alcohol.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.522
Over the Iimit?
Way over.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.822
Doc says she would
have blew about 0.12.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.520
She said she never
had a drink.

15:30.596 --> 15:34.930
Well, that's a good way
to get out of a DWI.
Accuse the cop of rape.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.261
Well, he sure thinks
Iike a cop.

15:37.336 --> 15:39.668
Took the condom wrapper
so now we can't get prints.

15:39.738 --> 15:41.603
If there was a condom.

15:42.474 --> 15:44.135
You think Francesca's
Iying about the rape?

15:44.209 --> 15:47.508
She Iied about being drunk.
Maybe it's just a habit.

15:47.713 --> 15:49.544
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

15:51.784 --> 15:54.218
Francesca Jesner
has two prior DWIs.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.345
The Iast one,
she got belligerent
with the arresting officer

15:56.422 --> 15:57.753
and was charged
with resisting.

15:57.823 --> 15:59.814
So this time she figured
she'd Iie her way out of it.

15:59.892 --> 16:02.190
Or maybe
she's telling the truth.

16:02.261 --> 16:04.661
These cases have
too much in common.

16:04.730 --> 16:06.925
Same area,
same time of night...

16:06.999 --> 16:09.593
Paula Grace's homicide
was front page news.

16:09.668 --> 16:11.863
Enough details
for Francesca
to fake her story.

16:11.937 --> 16:14.872
There is no way
that she could have
faked that traumatized.

16:14.940 --> 16:16.498
I'm telling you, Captain,
this woman was raped.

16:16.575 --> 16:18.600
I just don't want to
send the rat squad
on some witch hunt

16:18.677 --> 16:20.645
and screw
some innocent cop.
Neither do I.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.238
Could've been
anybody in a uniform.
Didn't have to be a real cop.

16:23.315 --> 16:26.751
It doesn't matter.
This woman is a rape victim
until we prove otherwise.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.980
Nobody is jumping
to any conclusions

16:29.054 --> 16:31.454
until we investigate
this case, okay?

16:33.592 --> 16:35.890
Two DWIs and she's still
behind the wheel?

16:35.961 --> 16:37.519
Her Iicense was revoked
once before.

16:37.596 --> 16:38.688
She just got it back.

16:38.764 --> 16:41.426
She is one moving violation
away from Iosing it for good.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.762
Which gives her
the motive to Iie

16:42.835 --> 16:44.063
when she got
pulled over Iast night.

16:44.136 --> 16:45.967
I'II have Munch
pull all citations

16:46.038 --> 16:47.505
and radio runs
from that precinct.

16:47.573 --> 16:51.031
You two check out
the victim's story,
and not a word to anybody.

16:57.182 --> 17:01.141
It was a big party.
Some hip artiste rented
the whole place out.

17:01.387 --> 17:04.584
Open bar, top-shelf booze,
everybody off the A-Iist.

17:04.656 --> 17:06.282
Must've been
300 people here.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.848
Was she one of them?

17:07.925 --> 17:09.518
Vodka-coke, no ice.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.890
Three hundred guests
and you remember her
that quick?

17:11.964 --> 17:13.454
She must've been
chained to the bar.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.261
She was knocking them back
pretty steady.

17:15.334 --> 17:19.361
AIone?
No, she was all over a guy,
hot and heavy.

17:19.438 --> 17:21.338
When she started
getting sloppy, I think
he walked her out.

17:21.406 --> 17:23.238
What did this guy
Iook Iike?

17:23.442 --> 17:24.431
I don't know.

17:24.510 --> 17:27.172
BIonde, tall.
You know,
every woman's dream.

17:29.648 --> 17:31.115
I didn't Ieave with anyone.

17:31.183 --> 17:33.014
Bartender says otherwise.

17:33.085 --> 17:36.054
Parking attendant says
he saw both of you
Ieave in your car.

17:36.121 --> 17:37.748
I say a cop raped me,

17:37.823 --> 17:39.085
and you stick up
for your own.

17:39.224 --> 17:42.421
Francesca, you Iied
about being drunk.

17:42.861 --> 17:44.488
I want to believe you.
I do.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.428
But you're not making it
easy for me.

17:47.099 --> 17:48.794
I didn't tell you
about the drinking

17:48.867 --> 17:51.131
because I knew
you would think
I made up the rape.

17:51.203 --> 17:53.000
FIN: What about the guy
you Ieft with?

17:53.572 --> 17:55.267
I used to work with him.

17:55.340 --> 17:57.501
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
He's married.
I don't want him involved.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.306
Well he's going to be,
unless you start
telling the truth.

18:00.379 --> 18:01.812
Excuse me.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.910
We parked and had sex.

18:06.051 --> 18:08.519
When we finished,
he caught a cab.

18:08.587 --> 18:11.852
I started to drive home
and the cop pulled me over.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.858
You should've told me that
from the beginning.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.484
We'II be back.

18:19.264 --> 18:22.961
What's up?
CSU wants us back
at the crime scene.

18:29.408 --> 18:31.603
So what's here
that you couldn't
tell us on the phone?

18:31.677 --> 18:33.668
A picture's worth
a thousand words.

18:33.745 --> 18:36.509
Take me through
your victim's account
of what happened.

18:36.582 --> 18:40.609
Francesca said that
the perp walked through
the alcohol field test here

18:41.420 --> 18:44.651
and as she was coming back
is when he grabbed her.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.814
See these drag marks?

18:46.892 --> 18:48.792
They match the shoes
your victim was wearing.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.692
We found gravel inside them.

18:50.762 --> 18:52.354
These are
your perp's footprints,

18:52.431 --> 18:54.831
and the tire tracks
match the ones
from across the way,

18:54.900 --> 18:56.390
where Paula Grace
was found.

18:57.002 --> 18:59.266
Shoe prints
tell us anything
about our mystery man?

18:59.338 --> 19:01.636
Based on the depths
of the shoe impressions
and their size,

19:01.707 --> 19:04.369
I'd say he's about
six foot, 200 pounds.

19:04.443 --> 19:06.468
Are there any cops
on your Iist of suspects?

19:06.545 --> 19:08.069
What makes you think
it's a cop?

19:08.147 --> 19:10.240
The blue fibers from under
Paula Grace's fingernails

19:10.315 --> 19:13.751
are consistent
with NYPD issue
uniform pants.

19:18.924 --> 19:21.017
MUNCH:
If Francesca Jesner
was pulled over by a cop,

19:21.093 --> 19:22.185
he did not write a summons.

19:22.261 --> 19:24.422
In fact, there were no
traffic stops or checkpoints

19:24.496 --> 19:26.191
anywhere near the area,
either night.

19:26.265 --> 19:27.527
CRAGEN: What about radio runs?

19:27.599 --> 19:30.261
AII cars accounted
for in the 22 both nights.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.496
Except one.

19:32.571 --> 19:33.936
Unmarked?

19:34.006 --> 19:37.908
Anticrime.
The cops worked in uniform.

19:38.210 --> 19:41.702
Both nights,
MIA during the time
of the attacks.

19:41.780 --> 19:43.475
Missing for how Iong?

19:43.549 --> 19:45.449
Forty-nine minutes
unaccounted for

19:45.517 --> 19:46.916
at the time
of Paula Grace's homicide,

19:46.985 --> 19:48.509
and 36 Iast night.

19:48.587 --> 19:50.145
CRAGEN: We have names?
Yeah.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.788
AI Marcosi and Roger Graves.

19:52.858 --> 19:56.191
Marcosi's got
more than 10 years on,
most of it on midnights.

19:56.261 --> 19:58.422
Graves got out
of the academy
Iast spring.

19:58.497 --> 20:01.557
Victim says
it was a white guy,
so Graves gets a pass.

20:01.633 --> 20:03.863
Unless he knew
what his partner was
doing on traffic stops.

20:03.936 --> 20:06.871
We got to get
their car down to CSU,
see if the tire tracks match.

20:06.939 --> 20:09.601
Which means we're gonna
have to involve IAB.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.905
I'II call the action desk,
have their jackets pulled,

20:11.977 --> 20:13.706
see if either one's
been a target before.

20:13.779 --> 20:17.340
Captain, before you do that,
Iet us take a run over
at the 22.

20:17.416 --> 20:18.940
If this Marcosi
is a wrong cop,

20:19.017 --> 20:20.644
I don't want him wise
that we Iike him for this.

20:20.719 --> 20:24.587
Yeah. Lieutenant over there
is my old boss who works
midnights, Phil Urzi.

20:24.656 --> 20:26.283
I'II finesse him.

20:29.761 --> 20:31.558
URZI: That strip under
the West Side Highway,

20:31.630 --> 20:33.291
worst spot
in the whole precinct.

20:33.365 --> 20:36.198
Car strippers,
prostitution, narcotics.

20:36.268 --> 20:38.168
But this is the first homicide
down there in years.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.637
We're thinking
that something
scared our perp off,

20:40.706 --> 20:42.003
that's why
we're checking
all police presence

20:42.074 --> 20:43.598
in that sector
at the time of the attack.

20:43.675 --> 20:45.666
We Iistened
to the division radio-tapes.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.076
Two of your guys,
we can't figure out
where they were.

20:48.146 --> 20:50.011
Marcosi and Graves.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.516
How'd you know?
My problem children.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.610
Two gold shield wannabes
who don't play by the rules.

20:55.687 --> 20:57.712
We can't account for them
for about a half-hour.

20:57.789 --> 20:59.484
Well, Iast night,
they were still
marked at a job,

20:59.558 --> 21:01.753
but they'd been gone
40 minutes.

21:01.827 --> 21:04.352
CIeared the job quick
when they heard
I was out Iooking for them.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.828
But why haven't you
ripped them yet?

21:05.897 --> 21:10.163
Because Marcosi and Graves
bring in the big collars.
Guns, drugs.

21:10.435 --> 21:13.495
Stopped a robbery in progress
three nights ago.

21:14.706 --> 21:15.968
You mind if we have
a Iittle chat with them?

21:16.041 --> 21:17.838
Not to bust their chops,
but we're thinking

21:17.909 --> 21:19.900
maybe they saw something
that can help us out
with our case.

21:19.978 --> 21:21.002
URZI: I don't mind.

21:21.079 --> 21:22.876
But I guarantee Marcosi will.

21:23.148 --> 21:25.048
Probably wants
the collar himself.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.711
Man, can you believe it?

21:28.787 --> 21:30.948
BENSON:
Hey, guys, got a minute?

21:31.023 --> 21:33.355
You are?
OIivia Benson,
Special Victims.

21:33.425 --> 21:34.483
This is Fin Tutuola.

21:34.559 --> 21:36.789
We caught the two cases
under the West Side Highway.

21:36.862 --> 21:37.954
How can we help you?

21:38.030 --> 21:40.897
We thought maybe you saw
something if you guys were
down there the other night.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.331
MARCOSI: Usually it's
the first place we check

21:42.401 --> 21:43.527
at the top
of the tour because

21:43.602 --> 21:45.797
that's where
most of the crimes
are committed in the precinct.

21:45.871 --> 21:47.805
But both times
we were someplace else.

21:47.873 --> 21:48.999
I wish we were there.

21:49.074 --> 21:51.133
We've been
searching for the vehicle
in the bulletin ever since.

21:51.209 --> 21:52.471
Can we call you
if we need anything?

21:52.544 --> 21:55.638
MARCOSI: Sure, you know
where you can find us.
Thank you.

21:59.251 --> 22:01.014
They were probably off
handling some investigation

22:01.086 --> 22:02.747
they didn't want
your Iieutenant friend
to know about.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.254
Yeah, well,
maybe you should
have asked them.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.154
What, you got a problem?
Yeah, I do.

22:06.224 --> 22:07.486
You softballing them
Iike that.

22:07.559 --> 22:10.653
I'm not going to go hard
on two good cops unless
I think they done something.

22:10.729 --> 22:13.596
What side are you on?
The victim's, where
we're supposed to be.

22:13.665 --> 22:14.791
Yeah, well,
what about the truth?

22:14.866 --> 22:16.231
Your victim's
definitely not
telling that.

22:16.301 --> 22:17.859
Oh, and your cops are?
You didn't even ask them.

22:17.936 --> 22:19.767
You sounded more Iike
their union rep
than anything else.

22:19.838 --> 22:21.328
I just call it
how I see it.

22:21.406 --> 22:22.896
Yeah? We just
blew our chance.

22:22.974 --> 22:24.771
And now it's IAB's call.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.975
Your detectives
went against policy.

22:31.049 --> 22:33.643
They were following
my orders on our case.

22:33.719 --> 22:36.085
For which a cop
may be a suspect.

22:36.154 --> 22:38.748
We investigate cops.
And we investigate
sex crimes.

22:38.824 --> 22:40.985
Look, it's not Iike
we were trying to hide
anything from you.

22:41.059 --> 22:43.186
You spoke to a target
without us.

22:43.261 --> 22:44.922
You of all people
should know better, Captain.

22:44.996 --> 22:47.226
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

22:47.299 --> 22:50.200
You knew about Marcosi
before we called you?

22:51.470 --> 22:54.234
He's been under investigation
for six months.

22:54.306 --> 22:55.796
Having sex
with a prostitute

22:55.874 --> 22:57.068
in exchange
for a reduced charge.

22:57.142 --> 23:00.009
And you didn't nail him?
Oh, we tried.

23:00.078 --> 23:03.878
But we couldn't find her.
She's been missing ever since.

23:10.489 --> 23:12.047
You're getting pretty good
with those.

23:12.124 --> 23:14.854
Better than Iifting weights.
Best workout I've had
in a Iong time.

23:14.926 --> 23:16.359
When you going to tell me
how you really got hurt?

23:16.428 --> 23:17.918
Why should I give that up
when you never even

23:17.996 --> 23:19.327
once mentioned that
you have offspring?

23:19.398 --> 23:22.765
My son? What,
OIivia told you that?

23:22.834 --> 23:24.597
I bare my soul to you,
and you can't even share

23:24.669 --> 23:26.500
that there's
a Iittle Tutuola
running around?

23:26.571 --> 23:28.869
He's not Iittle. He's 18.

23:32.444 --> 23:33.741
What did you find out?

23:33.812 --> 23:35.837
Prostitute's name
is Raquel Stephens.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.041
Missing Persons
has no record of a report.

23:38.116 --> 23:40.949
How did IAB get onto him?
Anonymous tip.

23:41.019 --> 23:43.954
Well, maybe
there's something
in her previous collars.

23:44.022 --> 23:45.387
I already
cross-referenced them

23:45.457 --> 23:47.425
with other prostitutes
picked up at the same time.

23:47.492 --> 23:50.222
Raquel was joined
quite regularly by
a Miss Mandy Mangum.

23:50.295 --> 23:53.196
Including the night
of the alleged incident.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.396
MANDY:
You come to remind me
of my right to remain silent?

23:59.471 --> 24:01.939
You're Raquel's friend.
And Marcosi's yours.

24:02.007 --> 24:04.703
And if he made
Raquel disappear,
he's no friend of ours.

24:04.776 --> 24:05.936
Why the hell
should I trust you?

24:06.011 --> 24:08.571
Because cops Iike Marcosi
make the rest of us Iook bad.

24:08.647 --> 24:10.444
If he did
something to Raquel,
he's going down.

24:10.515 --> 24:12.210
You got our word on it.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.750
I used to share a place
with Raquel.

24:17.823 --> 24:20.348
She disappeared about
a week after we got busted.

24:20.425 --> 24:23.292
We know you two
were collared together
that night. What happened?

24:23.361 --> 24:25.124
We were cuffed to
a bench in the precinct,

24:25.197 --> 24:26.323
and Marcosi came by.

24:26.398 --> 24:27.490
Raquel bummed a cigarette,

24:27.566 --> 24:29.056
and he took her into
a break room to smoke it.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.396
FIN:
She tell you what he said?

24:30.469 --> 24:31.834
She give him a freebie,

24:31.903 --> 24:33.461
and he'II get
our case dropped.

24:33.538 --> 24:36.166
So she did it right there
in the precinct.

24:36.241 --> 24:37.799
Marcosi offer you
the same deal?

24:37.876 --> 24:40.344
No, but he had
a real woody for Raquel.

24:40.412 --> 24:42.812
Next day he called her,
asked her for a date.

24:42.881 --> 24:44.178
She was excited.
Thought she might have

24:44.249 --> 24:46.217
a permanent
get-out-of-jail-free card.

24:46.284 --> 24:48.582
When I Ieft for the weekend
she had plans with him.

24:48.653 --> 24:50.518
Did you tell any other cops
about this?

24:50.589 --> 24:51.886
Some guy from Internal Affairs

24:51.957 --> 24:53.447
came by about
six months ago.

24:53.525 --> 24:54.787
I played dumb.

24:55.260 --> 24:57.455
I don't want
to disappear, too.

24:57.529 --> 25:01.590
If you think of anything else,
give us a call.

25:04.870 --> 25:08.306
You convinced now?
Not on the word
of some hooker.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.498
Those fibers under
Paula Grace's fingernails

25:10.575 --> 25:13.135
could have come
from any one of 40,000 cops.

25:13.211 --> 25:16.180
But the tire tracks
on the perp's car didn't.

25:18.083 --> 25:19.311
BENSON: When did these
go on?

25:19.384 --> 25:21.181
TREVOR: Yesterday,
according to Motor Pool.

25:21.253 --> 25:23.448
At whose request?
The cops who drive it.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.888
Said someone
stuck an ice pick
in two of the tires.

25:25.957 --> 25:28.323
Guess Motor Pool figured,
might as well
replace them all.

25:28.393 --> 25:29.985
Even if we find them
on some pile,

25:30.061 --> 25:32.029
the chain
of custody's broken.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.723
Looks kind of clean
for an anticrime car.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.360
Someone had
the undercarriage washed.

25:38.436 --> 25:40.461
So we're screwed?
Not totally.

25:42.941 --> 25:44.806
Gravel.
From all four wheel wells.

25:44.876 --> 25:48.004
Consistent with what we found
in Francesca Jesner's shoes.

25:49.881 --> 25:51.644
Your captain called.
You got to get back.

25:51.716 --> 25:53.707
What's going on?
Trouble.

25:56.154 --> 25:58.918
News is running a story
on a rapist cop
in the morning edition.

25:58.990 --> 26:01.788
How did it Ieak?
Hopefully not from here.

26:01.860 --> 26:04.192
You're Iooking at four
of the five people
who know about this,

26:04.262 --> 26:06.457
and nobody wants the media
badmouthing the job.

26:06.531 --> 26:08.795
Well, now that it's out,
we're running on
borrowed time.

26:08.867 --> 26:10.095
The paper won't
hold the story

26:10.168 --> 26:11.465
to safeguard
the investigation?

26:11.536 --> 26:13.800
They feel public safety
overrides.

26:13.872 --> 26:15.737
What about the safety
of the roads?

26:15.807 --> 26:17.604
Story breaks,
nobody stops for the police.

26:17.676 --> 26:19.735
And Marcosi gets
rid of his evidence.

26:19.811 --> 26:21.608
We need a warrant
for his Iocker.

26:21.680 --> 26:22.806
Well, my bosses
are going to want

26:22.881 --> 26:24.178
more than
a couple rocks and fibers

26:24.249 --> 26:25.614
before they go after a cop.

26:25.684 --> 26:29.586
Then put a spin on it
as a necessary step to clear
Marcosi if he's not involved.

26:29.654 --> 26:31.884
AIex, we don't move fast
on this, we Iose them.

26:31.957 --> 26:34.221
Okay.
Thanks.

26:37.996 --> 26:40.464
OFFICER 1: I smell a rat.
OFFICER 2: Make that three.

26:40.532 --> 26:41.999
Come on, fellows.

26:45.503 --> 26:47.528
Here we go. 157.

(OFFICERS CHATTERING)

26:54.546 --> 26:56.377
BENSON:
He's quite the Iadies' man.

26:56.448 --> 26:57.881
Let's bag everything.

27:03.321 --> 27:04.447
Bingo.

27:05.023 --> 27:07.116
Rough Riders.
Our favorite brand.

27:07.192 --> 27:09.717
Hey, that's private property.

27:10.562 --> 27:13.929
Yeah?
These private property, too?

27:13.999 --> 27:15.591
Locker belongs to the city.

27:15.667 --> 27:17.931
The contents are mine.
You can't do this.

27:18.003 --> 27:20.801
Well, this says we can.
You got to talk to us.

27:21.773 --> 27:24.867
BENSON: Have your union
delegate meet you over
at SVU.

27:25.076 --> 27:28.637
I don't need a union delegate.
I got nothing to hide.

27:28.947 --> 27:32.144
You think
that I killed a girl
under the West Side Highway?

27:32.217 --> 27:34.412
Are you nuts?
You fit the description
of the suspect.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.750
AIong with 100 other guys
in my command.

27:36.821 --> 27:38.220
But the only one
unaccounted for

27:38.289 --> 27:40.018
at the time
of both crimes is you.

27:40.091 --> 27:41.683
I bend the rules
a Iittle, so what?

27:41.760 --> 27:44.251
Well, then
there's your vehicle,
matches what the perp drove,

27:44.329 --> 27:46.058
and Forensics places you
at the crime scene.

27:46.131 --> 27:47.564
AIong with a dozen
other cars.

27:47.632 --> 27:49.327
We're constantly
checking the area.

27:49.401 --> 27:51.767
Why'd you take it
to the car wash?
It was caked in mud.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.997
Is that
why you conveniently
had the tires replaced?

27:54.072 --> 27:57.200
We came out
and found two flats,
courtesy of an ice pick.

27:57.275 --> 27:58.674
CRAGEN: You got an out
for everything, don't you?

27:58.743 --> 28:00.836
I don't have to explain
how I work to you.

28:00.912 --> 28:03.710
Nobody in that precinct
brings in more collars
than me.

28:03.782 --> 28:07.309
Really?
Well, how many cops
in the precinct date hookers?

28:07.385 --> 28:09.580
Oh, I get a Iittle
bit on the side.

28:09.654 --> 28:11.645
I don't pay for it.
That's not a crime.

28:11.723 --> 28:14.157
It is when you
make them disappear.

28:14.225 --> 28:15.419
(PAGER BEEPING)

28:15.493 --> 28:16.721
What are you talking about?

28:16.795 --> 28:19.730
IAB is investigating you
for Raquel Stephens.

28:19.798 --> 28:20.924
Excuse me.

28:20.999 --> 28:22.864
Raquel?
BENSON: Yeah, Raquel.

28:22.934 --> 28:25.494
You collared her Iast year.
She gave you a freebie.

28:25.570 --> 28:28.368
You Iet her walk,
then she just disappears

28:28.440 --> 28:30.067
after her Iittle date
with you.

28:30.909 --> 28:32.900
She went to an alcohol rehab
somewhere upstate.

28:32.977 --> 28:34.467
FIN: You remember where?
She didn't say.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.480
I swear, I didn't
do anything to her.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.537
You want to go down
for this?

28:37.615 --> 28:40.880
I am not going down.
I didn't rape those girls.

28:40.952 --> 28:42.852
I break the rules
a Iittle bit,
but I get results.

28:42.921 --> 28:44.445
We're trying
to help you here, AI.

28:44.522 --> 28:47.753
Why should I believe you?
You just got to
take my word for it.

28:47.826 --> 28:50.260
We're talking
rape-homicide here.

28:50.395 --> 28:54.354
If you didn't do it,
worst thing IAB can do
to you is a five-day rip.

29:02.173 --> 29:05.142
I was down there
the night of the murder,
under the West Side Highway.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.235
FIN: Doing what?
I had a date in the car.

29:07.312 --> 29:08.404
Where was your partner?

29:08.480 --> 29:10.175
Looking out for me,
and it's a good thing
he was.

29:10.248 --> 29:11.442
He see anything?
Yeah.

29:11.516 --> 29:13.643
Our boss, Lieutenant Urzi,
came driving towards us.

29:13.718 --> 29:15.379
So Graves comes up,
knocks on the window.

29:15.453 --> 29:17.944
We got out of there,
no Iights,
before Urzi caught us.

29:18.022 --> 29:19.319
Who was the girl?

29:19.390 --> 29:21.449
Some random citizen
picked me up. She offered.

29:21.526 --> 29:23.460
I don't even know her name.

29:25.630 --> 29:27.029
Give us a second.

29:31.102 --> 29:32.433
FIN: Marcosi's talking.

29:32.504 --> 29:34.904
Put himself
at the scene the night
of Paula Grace's murder.

29:34.973 --> 29:36.270
We got another victim.

29:36.341 --> 29:37.433
Marcosi's been with us
for hours.

29:37.509 --> 29:38.703
No, no, no.
It could still be him.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.211
This is six weeks old.
And she's just
reporting it now?

29:41.279 --> 29:42.712
She was afraid
to accuse a cop,

29:42.781 --> 29:44.544
came forward after
she saw it on the news.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.379
Where is she?
Interview.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.385
Fin, I want you
on the phone to IAB.

29:48.453 --> 29:50.318
They're sweating
Marcosi's partner
Graves now.

29:50.388 --> 29:51.980
I want to know
everything they got.

29:52.056 --> 29:53.580
OIivia, I'm calling in Huang.

29:53.658 --> 29:55.558
I want you and him
in with the victim.

30:00.331 --> 30:02.390
I came off
the West Side Highway,
took a shortcut.

30:02.467 --> 30:05.197
He stopped me,
said that I was speeding.

30:07.172 --> 30:09.606
He told me
to get out of the car.

30:10.775 --> 30:12.800
Then he told me
to take off my clothes.

30:12.877 --> 30:15.778
I just obeyed.
I kept staring at
the gun on his belt.

30:15.847 --> 30:17.212
BENSON: You didn't
have a choice, Stacia.

30:17.282 --> 30:20.217
Maybe I should have
screamed, fought back.

30:21.352 --> 30:23.582
A cop with a gun
stopped you.

30:24.155 --> 30:27.022
You made the right decision.
You survived.

30:31.696 --> 30:34.130
Stacia, can I ask you
a question?

30:34.199 --> 30:37.896
During the rape,
did he experience
any sexual difficulties?

30:40.605 --> 30:42.300
He was on top of me,
and then he stopped,

30:42.373 --> 30:44.238
and at first I thought
that he'd finished,

30:44.309 --> 30:47.506
but then I realized
that he Iost his, you know...

30:49.314 --> 30:51.874
His erection.
Yeah.

30:55.053 --> 30:57.283
So then,
how did he react to that?

30:57.388 --> 30:59.686
I opened my eyes

31:02.493 --> 31:06.224
and he slapped me
across the face so hard
that I cried out.

31:09.834 --> 31:11.927
And then he started again.

31:16.107 --> 31:19.235
Stacia,
do you recognize
any of these men?

31:24.883 --> 31:28.375
It was dark
and my eyes were closed.
I never saw his face.

31:29.454 --> 31:31.319
Thank you. Excuse me.

31:31.389 --> 31:32.981
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

31:33.691 --> 31:36.785
I called IAB.
Graves isn't talking.
CRAGEN: Where was Marcosi?

31:36.861 --> 31:39.091
I checked the roll call.
He wasn't working that day.

31:39.163 --> 31:40.357
He's got everything else
covered.

31:40.431 --> 31:41.921
What do you want
to bet he's got an alibi?

31:42.000 --> 31:44.491
Doc, can you help us
out here?

31:44.569 --> 31:48.505
The badge, the uniform
and the gun all bolster
your perp's sense of power,

31:48.573 --> 31:51.440
which enhances
his masculinity
and his control.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.870
That's probably why
he became a cop
in the first place.

31:53.945 --> 31:56.209
He keeps their driver's
Iicenses as trophies.

31:56.281 --> 31:57.305
Strong possibility.

31:57.382 --> 31:59.816
Every time
he Iooks at them again,
he relives the thrill.

31:59.884 --> 32:02.079
She didn't resist,
he couldn't perform,
so he hits her.

32:02.153 --> 32:03.984
I mean, this guy
gets off on violence.

32:04.055 --> 32:07.957
And killing the first victim
probably gave him an appetite
for more.

32:08.026 --> 32:09.186
If that car hadn't come by,

32:09.260 --> 32:10.852
he would have killed
Francesca Jesner, too.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.760
Marcosi fit your profile?

32:12.830 --> 32:15.321
Well, I'd Iike to spend
some time with him.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.599
Do it.

32:18.336 --> 32:20.861
I've seen your arrest record.
It's very impressive.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.270
Ever since
I was a Iittle boy,

32:22.340 --> 32:24.274
all I wanted to be
was a detective.

32:24.842 --> 32:26.275
Thrill of the chase?

32:26.511 --> 32:29.071
I make a collar,
I get a real rush.

32:31.149 --> 32:34.812
The same rush you get
when a beautiful woman
comes on to you?

32:37.021 --> 32:40.718
Yeah.
Yeah, it's kind of
the same, you know?

32:41.592 --> 32:44.254
It's Iike a game.
"Will she? Won't she?"

32:45.129 --> 32:46.562
And if she says no?

32:46.764 --> 32:48.254
PIenty of fish in the sea.

32:50.201 --> 32:54.331
What about on duty?
What do you do when you
meet a woman on the job?

32:54.472 --> 32:56.770
Department regs
say stay away,
but I can't help it

32:56.841 --> 32:58.240
if these girls
call the command

32:58.309 --> 33:00.106
and they come
Iooking for me.

33:00.945 --> 33:02.572
You do all this
great work on the street,

33:02.647 --> 33:04.239
and they won't
give you a gold shield.

33:04.315 --> 33:06.977
That must frustrate you.
You know what frustrates me?

33:07.051 --> 33:10.214
Everybody is so concerned
about my personal Iife.

33:10.455 --> 33:13.356
You can't make detective,
you break a few rules.

33:13.424 --> 33:15.221
You can't get a woman
to sleep with you,
what do you do?

33:15.293 --> 33:20.356
You are so wrong.
I don't need to rape.
You think I did this?

33:20.465 --> 33:21.796
Give me a chance
to clear myself.

33:21.866 --> 33:24.699
You bring in your victims.
I'II stand in a Iineup.

33:31.309 --> 33:33.607
How's Francesca going to
pick Marcosi out of a Iineup

33:33.678 --> 33:35.009
when she couldn't
even give us a sketch?

33:35.079 --> 33:36.603
What the hell's
going on over here?

33:36.681 --> 33:37.943
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

33:38.016 --> 33:39.916
BENSON: Hey, what's up?

33:39.984 --> 33:41.747
If you're Iooking
for Franny, you're too Iate.

33:41.819 --> 33:42.979
Francesca Jesner?

33:43.054 --> 33:44.578
That girl sure knows
how to party.

33:44.655 --> 33:46.646
Your buddy
got her in the car
without your help.

33:46.724 --> 33:48.919
A cop?
They've arrested her
before.

33:48.993 --> 33:50.688
Thought she was going
to claw his eyes out

33:50.762 --> 33:54.289
before he got
the cuffs on her,
yelling he raped her.

33:57.502 --> 33:58.935
Perp must have seen
a news story

33:59.003 --> 34:01.062
and snatched Francesca up
so she couldn't ID him.

34:01.139 --> 34:03.073
Neighbors get a make
on the car, or a plate?

34:03.141 --> 34:05.575
AII they gave us
was a dark sedan,
red Iight on the dash.

34:05.643 --> 34:08.304
Marcosi's still here.
Rule him out.
How much time we got, Doc?

34:08.379 --> 34:09.971
He chose not to kill her
in the apartment

34:10.047 --> 34:11.879
because he wanted
the thrill of arresting her.

34:11.949 --> 34:14.782
I'd guess
he'd keep her for a while,
until he got tired of her.

34:14.851 --> 34:16.547
Anything?
I checked Communications.

34:16.621 --> 34:20.580
No cars called in on a job
or a response anywhere
near Francesca's apartment.

34:20.658 --> 34:23.592
Maybe Fin's right
and our guy isn't a cop.

34:24.295 --> 34:27.161
You said that the badge
makes our perp feel
Iike a real man.

34:27.231 --> 34:30.792
Ted Bundy and how many
other serial killers
did the exact same thing?

34:30.868 --> 34:33.563
What if our guy's
just some schmuck
playing dress up?

34:33.638 --> 34:36.869
Men impersonate cops
for the same reason
that they rape and kill.

34:36.940 --> 34:40.138
It's a Iack of confidence
combined with the need for
the ultimate power trip.

34:40.210 --> 34:42.145
Not to mention
the perfect disguise.

34:42.213 --> 34:43.942
Nobody's going to question
a cop pulling them over.

34:44.014 --> 34:45.107
Or making a collar.

34:45.183 --> 34:46.650
Francesca's neighbors
didn't think twice

34:46.717 --> 34:48.241
when they saw our guy
take her away.

34:48.319 --> 34:50.844
AIso explains why he
was alone in the car.
No partner.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.685
Your impersonator unit
help us out?

34:52.757 --> 34:54.748
I'II pull the files,
see if anybody fits.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.554
The night Paula Grace
was killed

34:56.627 --> 35:00.119
Marcosi said he thought
he saw Lieutenant Urzi
following them.

35:00.198 --> 35:04.134
Now if Urzi
and our perp both
drive a dark Crown Vic...

35:04.235 --> 35:05.964
Then it could have been
our perp.

35:07.472 --> 35:08.803
Get away from me.

35:08.873 --> 35:10.932
Take it easy.
What, are you kidding me?

35:11.008 --> 35:13.067
I know I'm not pure,
but you and your buddy
from rat squad,

35:13.144 --> 35:15.339
they got me riding a desk.
For what?

35:15.413 --> 35:16.744
You made yourself
Iook wrong,

35:16.814 --> 35:17.906
and we were just
doing our jobs.

35:17.982 --> 35:20.177
Had you been in our position,
you would have done
the exact same thing.

35:20.251 --> 35:22.481
Now do yours
and help us out.

35:22.753 --> 35:24.846
You got some nerve
asking me for help.

35:24.922 --> 35:28.085
The perp snatched up
one of his previous victims.

35:29.160 --> 35:31.924
You wasted your time
fingering me.
You're right.

35:31.996 --> 35:34.464
So hate us
but don't Iet her die.

35:34.632 --> 35:36.532
That happens, it's on you.

35:37.101 --> 35:38.090
Go to hell.

35:40.371 --> 35:41.702
TUCKER: We can rule out
these guys.

35:41.772 --> 35:43.740
Interested in the toys,
but they don't play
with them.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.571
Whoever this guy was,
he needed the gear.

35:45.643 --> 35:48.237
You can't buy uniforms
without departmental ID.

35:48.312 --> 35:49.973
How about vendors?

35:50.348 --> 35:53.476
Only a dozen stores
in the Tri-State sell
NYPD equipment,

35:53.551 --> 35:56.019
and we keep a pretty
tight watch on them.

35:56.587 --> 35:58.020
I'II make a call.

35:59.190 --> 36:00.555
I got all the violent ones.

36:00.625 --> 36:04.322
They use the uniform
for bank robberies,
home invasions, rapes.

36:04.395 --> 36:06.659
MUNCH: I ran the entire Iot
for prior sexual assaults,

36:06.731 --> 36:08.699
with and without
impersonation as an M.O.

36:08.766 --> 36:10.631
Came up with 13.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.728
By the time
we get through these,
Francesca could be dead.

36:13.804 --> 36:14.828
TUCKER: Thanks.

36:14.906 --> 36:18.467
Three stores in the Iast year
caught selling NYPD gear
to anybody willing to pay.

36:18.543 --> 36:20.773
We closed two of them down
before your attacks.

36:20.845 --> 36:23.473
Third one's still open,
but on probation.

36:23.548 --> 36:24.810
Let's go.

36:27.752 --> 36:29.379
O'KEEFE:
We check ID on everyone.

36:29.453 --> 36:30.579
Sure, now you do.

36:30.655 --> 36:31.917
After you were
investigated Iast year

36:31.989 --> 36:33.422
for selling phony
police shields.

36:33.491 --> 36:35.823
They were replicas.
Came with a disclaimer.

36:35.893 --> 36:38.555
And the Kevlar vests
IAB caught you selling
to drug dealers,

36:38.629 --> 36:40.529
they replicas, too?
They had ID.

36:40.598 --> 36:42.691
I checked. I swear.

36:42.934 --> 36:44.299
IAB cleared me.

36:44.368 --> 36:47.337
And now they're
foaming from the mouth
to de-authorize you.

36:47.405 --> 36:51.034
AII those academy grads
spending $5,000 a pop
to buy their new gear,

36:51.108 --> 36:53.542
taking their business
elsewhere.
Okay. Okay.

36:53.611 --> 36:55.670
Everything over the counter
was Iegit.

36:55.746 --> 36:57.646
There might be some guys
on the mailing Iist
who aren't.

36:57.715 --> 36:59.012
Okay.
Let's have them now,

36:59.083 --> 37:00.948
along with
your sales records
for the Iast six months.

37:01.018 --> 37:02.918
Let's go. Let's go. Now!

37:06.657 --> 37:09.387
A couple of these names
have already come up
in the impersonator files.

37:09.460 --> 37:10.449
What do you expect?

37:10.528 --> 37:12.257
That place is a police buff's
wet dream.

37:12.330 --> 37:14.924
One of them bought
handcuffs and a gun belt.

37:14.999 --> 37:17.763
Here's two uniform shirts,
a nightstick,

37:17.835 --> 37:20.099
another one with full
highway patrol gear,

37:20.171 --> 37:22.105
one red dashboard Iight.

37:23.040 --> 37:25.201
You know how many
red dashboard Iights
are sold each year?

37:25.276 --> 37:26.971
It'II take us a week
to track them down.

37:27.044 --> 37:29.012
Look what just blew in.

37:31.449 --> 37:33.383
What are you doing here?

37:35.119 --> 37:38.088
You were going to ask me
whether or not I was sure
it was Lieutenant Urzi

37:38.155 --> 37:40.851
that followed me the night
of Paula Grace's murder.
I got that right?

37:40.925 --> 37:42.586
You going to ask questions
or answer them?

37:42.660 --> 37:44.992
I only saw the car, not him.

37:45.062 --> 37:46.757
But I wrote down a partial
Iicense plate number

37:46.831 --> 37:49.129
to check against his car
back at the precinct.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.566
It wasn't his.
It's got to be your perp's.

37:51.636 --> 37:54.127
Give us the number.
We'II run it.
I already did.

37:54.205 --> 37:55.331
It's not
a department vehicle,

37:55.406 --> 37:57.465
and there's only one
dark blue Crown Vic

37:57.541 --> 37:59.202
with anything Iike it
in the city.

37:59.277 --> 38:02.007
It's registered
to a Jeffery Trapani.

38:02.246 --> 38:05.079
819 West 88th Street.

38:05.249 --> 38:07.217
That's right in the middle
of the crime zone.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.513
Look, we don't have Trapani,

38:08.586 --> 38:10.247
but I've got
a Jeffery Trapper.

38:10.321 --> 38:12.721
One red dash Iight
and a set of uni blues.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.655
He was a guest
of the state
for burglary two

38:14.725 --> 38:17.387
until he made parole
about a half a year ago.

38:17.461 --> 38:19.429
I'II get Cabot on standby
for a warrant.

38:19.497 --> 38:20.589
Tell her what we're doing.

38:20.665 --> 38:22.394
Have her meet us
at the Iocation.

38:23.334 --> 38:26.235
Thank you.
You did the right thing.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.273
Go! Go! Go!

38:34.745 --> 38:36.042
It's clear.

38:36.714 --> 38:39.706
OFFICER: Kitchen's clear.
Entrance clear.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.244
BENSON: They were here.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.017
Looks Iike spatter
from a beating.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.557
No police gear.

38:48.626 --> 38:51.254
PIace hardly Iooks Iived in.
Hey, he's got to keep
his stash somewhere.

38:51.329 --> 38:54.059
Maybe where he's stashing
Francesca.
Let's go.

38:57.268 --> 38:58.929
Any idea where this guy
could be?

38:59.003 --> 39:01.301
Munch checked.
Trapani's got a job
with the Parks Department.

39:01.372 --> 39:03.397
Part of his work release.
Bring him in. Run a Iineup.

39:03.474 --> 39:06.068
Guy Iike this
isn't going to confess.
We know where Trapani is.

39:06.143 --> 39:08.008
Let's put him
under surveillance.
Too risky.

39:08.079 --> 39:09.512
If we Iose him,
he might snatch
another victim.

39:09.580 --> 39:11.172
What about the one
he already grabbed?

39:11.248 --> 39:14.445
We play by our rules,
not his.
Captain?

39:14.518 --> 39:16.918
We'II keep somebody
on the apartment in case
Trapani comes back.

39:16.987 --> 39:19.683
You two,
get to the park
and pick him up.

39:23.794 --> 39:25.489
There he is.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.705
FIN: Look at him
stab that stuff.

39:43.614 --> 39:45.275
Who you calling?

39:46.083 --> 39:48.984
Munch.
Yeah, we're at the park.

39:50.054 --> 39:53.546
Tell the Captain and Cabot
Trapani's not here.

39:55.126 --> 39:58.289
If this goes south,
you know we're both
back in uniform.

39:58.362 --> 40:00.694
And if we don't try,
Francesca's dead.

40:05.970 --> 40:08.768
You don't know somebody
till you work with them.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.811
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

40:21.218 --> 40:22.845
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

40:26.390 --> 40:29.018
There he is.
Figures he'd drink
at a cop bar.

40:29.093 --> 40:31.926
There's no guarantee
he's going anywhere
near Francesca.

40:31.996 --> 40:34.123
Unless we give him
a reason.

40:37.334 --> 40:38.801
FIN: Two beers.

40:40.137 --> 40:42.230
BENSON: You hear about
this cluster over at the 22?

40:42.306 --> 40:45.434
Not much out there.
IAB's got such
a tight Iid on it.

40:45.709 --> 40:47.438
I know a Iot of guys
over there.

40:47.511 --> 40:50.002
Can't figure on any of them
doing something Iike this.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.206
Thanks.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.045
Yeah, that guy's
got a set on him,

40:53.117 --> 40:55.449
grabbing her up
in broad daylight Iike that.

40:55.519 --> 40:57.612
BENSON: You think she's dead?
FIN: She's got to be.

40:57.688 --> 40:59.121
Keeping her alive
is too high-risk.

40:59.190 --> 41:01.351
She's a one-way ticket
to death row.

41:01.425 --> 41:05.122
Hope,
for her sake, you're wrong.
They Iike anybody for this?

41:05.262 --> 41:08.163
I got a friend in the DL
says they're real close.

41:08.232 --> 41:09.859
Not soon enough for me.

41:10.100 --> 41:13.592
I got to tell you,
even I'm freaked
to drive over there.

41:16.941 --> 41:21.071
If Francesca's
not his next stop,
we got to pick him up.

41:30.254 --> 41:33.712
We should have
followed him closer.
He would have made us.

41:40.431 --> 41:42.058
Over here.

41:43.400 --> 41:44.697
(FRANCESCA GROANING)

41:48.873 --> 41:52.274
Police! Back away from her!
Put your hands on your head.

41:52.543 --> 41:55.478
Okay, back away slowly.
Come down here.

41:55.746 --> 41:58.476
Get on the floor.
Assume the position.

42:02.319 --> 42:07.723
He said that we were
almost finished
and I was next.

42:07.791 --> 42:11.090
Don't worry, Francesca.
He can't hurt you anymore.

42:11.462 --> 42:13.191
Check this out.

42:13.297 --> 42:14.992
(FRANCESCA SOBBING)

42:18.269 --> 42:22.535
That's quite a trophy wall,
but you're not much of a cop,
are you?

42:22.606 --> 42:24.836
Followed you straight to her,

42:26.243 --> 42:28.211
and you didn't even spot us.

42:28.612 --> 42:29.772
You're hurting me.

42:29.847 --> 42:32.907
That's going to be the Ieast
of your problems, pal.
