00:27.485 --> 00:30.447
-You okay?

00:30.530 --> 00:31.740
-And we're back.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.253
Holy shit!

00:45.962 --> 00:48.506
Andre's live streaming
<i>It's a Brand New Dre</i>. Do we listen?

00:48.590 --> 00:49.591
Eh, okay.

00:51.760 --> 00:55.597
Hello, Dre-niacs, and welcome to a special
Sunday edition of <i>It's a Brand New Dre</i>

00:55.680 --> 00:58.141
with your host, me, Dre.

00:58.808 --> 00:59.976
As you all know,

01:00.477 --> 01:03.605
this podcast is usually
about self-love and self-care,

01:04.355 --> 01:05.690
but sometimes trauma runs so deep

01:05.774 --> 01:07.817
that all the self-help in the world
can't fix it.

01:07.901 --> 01:11.237
<i>I recently discovered my boyfriend</i>
<i>and my best girlfriend,</i>

01:11.321 --> 01:13.239
they were having an affair behind my back.

01:13.740 --> 01:14.866
<i>Oh!</i>

01:14.949 --> 01:16.117
Shit!

01:16.201 --> 01:18.745
I caught them mouth-to-mouth,
and she did not need resuscitating.

01:18.828 --> 01:20.371
I'll pause for gasps.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.040
<i>Betrayers, they're worse than murderers.</i>

01:22.123 --> 01:24.501
-Even worse than dog murderers…

01:24.584 --> 01:27.170
<i>…because at least their victims</i>
<i>are out of their misery.</i>

01:27.253 --> 01:29.714
<i>You think you know</i>
<i>who your friends and lovers are</i>

01:29.798 --> 01:31.800
until they sever your emotional dick
and stab you.

01:31.883 --> 01:33.343
And there's no coming back from that.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.095
<i>I'm sorry. Is that too far?</i>

01:35.178 --> 01:37.639
I can't tell anymore
because I'm broken.

01:39.307 --> 01:41.017
<i>But seriously, I mean,</i>

01:41.101 --> 01:43.603
<i>what type of person would wanna</i>
<i>hurt someone that loves them?</i>

01:45.188 --> 01:46.397
So what do you do?

01:47.649 --> 01:49.692
<i>Usually, I say be the bigger person,</i>

01:49.776 --> 01:51.027
turn the other cheek.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.864
But there are those rare times
where forgiveness isn't enough,

01:54.948 --> 01:56.491
when the pain is too deep.

01:57.325 --> 01:59.244
In those deeply painful times,

02:00.286 --> 02:02.539
you just need
to call those assholes out by name.

02:03.748 --> 02:05.542
Fuck you, Cam and Demi!

02:12.382 --> 02:16.469
We're out of toilet paper,
and you should probably do the laundry,

02:16.553 --> 02:18.263
specifically a T-shirt of yours

02:18.346 --> 02:21.766
that may or may not
have been used as toilet paper.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.351
Oh!

02:24.894 --> 02:27.313
Is that Hermès?

02:27.939 --> 02:31.734
Hand-rolled edges?
Oh, the print is perfect.

02:32.777 --> 02:33.945
Mm.

02:34.028 --> 02:37.323
Copywritten? Wait, this is real!
Where did you get this?

02:37.407 --> 02:39.033
Have you been hooking? JK!

02:39.117 --> 02:41.661
But seriously, you shouldn't steal.

02:41.744 --> 02:45.039
So she's rich. Where do you think
someone who owns this lives?

02:45.123 --> 02:46.207
Hm…

02:47.208 --> 02:50.378
Mm. I'm getting coastal vibes.

02:50.461 --> 02:51.504
Oh.

02:51.588 --> 02:55.800
Or I'm smelling
a hint of Kardashian Calabasas.

02:55.884 --> 02:59.053
Mm. No! I'm smelling,

02:59.137 --> 03:03.683
mm, saggy balls,
tennis court, Beverly Hills.

03:04.809 --> 03:06.686
Oh!

03:06.769 --> 03:08.313
Is that Chanel N°5?

03:09.355 --> 03:10.231
No.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.986
-Chanel N°10, so she's double rich.
-Oh.

03:15.069 --> 03:16.779
Oh, money. Mm.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.823
Bel Air, Holmby Hills?

03:19.449 --> 03:22.744
Hey, don't forget to tell Rusty
to add TP to the grocery list.

03:22.827 --> 03:25.455
Wait. What's your stance on revenge?

03:25.538 --> 03:27.999
I'm all for it,
unless it's about your T-shirt.

03:28.082 --> 03:28.917
Nope.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.668
Then, yeah, I'm all for it.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.213
-Ah!
-Ow!

03:34.964 --> 03:36.257
Ugh, not here.

03:36.341 --> 03:39.344
Sorry. PDA now just feels
like publicly disrespecting Andre.

03:39.427 --> 03:41.471
Don't let what he said
on the show get to you.

03:41.554 --> 03:44.057
I'm the other woman,
and now the whole school knows.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.475
You're the only woman.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.685
This is why
I didn't wanna break up with him,

03:47.769 --> 03:50.021
because I knew that he'd react like this.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.774
What we did to him was traumatizing.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.235
What if he could never open up his heart
to anyone again?

03:55.318 --> 03:57.487
He was traumatized
when skinny jeans went out of style.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.113
-So I think he's gonna be okay.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.657
He said he was broken.

04:00.740 --> 04:04.786
Okay, look. Neither one of us wanted to
hurt Andre, but what happened, happened.

04:04.869 --> 04:07.664
And we can't change that
or control how he feels about it.

04:07.747 --> 04:11.084
All we can do is try to move past it
and focus on us.

04:11.167 --> 04:14.170
Demi, this is finally
our chance to be together.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.756
-Oh!
-Home-wrecker!

04:16.839 --> 04:18.549
What home?

04:23.638 --> 04:24.847
Revenge!

04:24.931 --> 04:28.142
Ow! Gloria, what the hell?
Why did you just hit me in the face?

04:28.226 --> 04:30.603
Oh, sorry. I was aiming for your nuts!

04:30.687 --> 04:32.188
How if I'm sitting down?

04:32.272 --> 04:34.107
-It doesn't matter!
-Okay?

04:34.190 --> 04:37.235
Not okay! How dare you blow off my sister?

04:37.318 --> 04:40.738
Wait, why are you mad?
You want me to be into your sister?

04:40.822 --> 04:44.284
Oh, why not?
You're into everyone else! A whore!

04:45.243 --> 04:47.245
Gloria, stop! You're acting crazy!

04:49.580 --> 04:51.457
I'll show you crazy!

04:51.541 --> 04:53.835
C-R-A-Z-Y!

04:55.461 --> 04:57.922
Okay, Gloria, come on.
You're not actually gonna punch--

04:59.048 --> 05:00.800
Heard you got luncha-bullied!

05:00.883 --> 05:03.886
-Hey! Gloria's in a fight!
-Gloria's in a fight?

05:05.054 --> 05:07.849
What? But Ines is right here.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.980
Hey. Hey, stop that! Stop it!

05:16.816 --> 05:18.276
Gloria,

05:18.359 --> 05:19.444
I have no words.

05:19.527 --> 05:22.113
Good. Then let's have this convo tomorrow,

05:22.196 --> 05:25.199
after my retrial
for the bent arm hang record.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.743
No.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.536
-Can I help you?

05:28.619 --> 05:30.496
I-- I'm here for my daughter, Gloria.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.916
Oh, I was expecting your partner.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.793
-My partner?
-I'm sorry.

05:35.877 --> 05:38.296
I mean, your husband, Javier?

05:38.379 --> 05:39.213
I'm Javier.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.800
That must get confusing in your house.

05:42.884 --> 05:46.262
Well, anyway, as you know,
this is Gloria's last strike.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.597
When was her first strike?

05:50.975 --> 05:53.853
First, the party, now this? I don't know
what's going on with you, Glo.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.105
Tonio!

05:56.189 --> 05:57.231
Javier?

05:57.315 --> 05:59.192
Oh no!

05:59.275 --> 06:02.445
-This isn't my dentist's office.
-I don't know who I'm more upset with.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.906
My short-tempered daughter
or my dumbass brother.

06:04.989 --> 06:05.948
You impersonated me?

06:06.032 --> 06:10.244
It wasn't really an impersonation
as much as an original interpretation.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.622
And also, I never knew you'd find out.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.457
Why couldn't you
keep your fists to yourself?

06:14.540 --> 06:15.917
I might have to pay workers' comp.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.669
Don't come at me. Why wasn't
the home phone routed to your cell?

06:18.753 --> 06:21.089
-What do I pay you for?
-You pay him?

06:21.172 --> 06:22.131
Not in a timely fashion.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.426
It was routed, but you were texting me at
the same time, which bumps the connection

06:25.510 --> 06:27.136
'cause your dad won't upgrade our service.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.304
You're on our family plan?

06:28.388 --> 06:30.723
And how was I supposed to know
your dad was gonna be home

06:30.807 --> 06:32.600
in the middle of the day?

06:32.683 --> 06:34.310
Yeah, Dad, why were you home?

06:34.394 --> 06:36.312
You're never home
in the middle of the day.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.439
-What happened?
-Your sister got expelled.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.690
Expelled?

06:39.774 --> 06:42.610
For fighting my battle?
I didn't ask you to do that!

06:42.693 --> 06:46.197
Now it makes sense. Ines, what did you do?
Why did you get your sister expelled?

06:46.280 --> 06:47.323
I did nothing!

06:47.407 --> 06:48.616
This is not on Ines!

06:48.699 --> 06:51.077
Gloria, stop protecting your sister.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.704
I'm so disappointed in you!

06:54.914 --> 06:56.124
As am I!

06:58.334 --> 06:59.710
Sorry, I'm still in Javier mode.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.587
-You go to my car!
-Oh!

07:01.671 --> 07:04.132
Where were you when your sister needed you
to hold her back?

07:04.215 --> 07:05.258
Why is this my fault?

07:05.341 --> 07:09.178
Ines, stop being selfish. You're supposed
to look out for each other.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.763
Now go to class! Come on.

07:13.850 --> 07:14.684
Sorry.

07:16.602 --> 07:20.314
I mean, he got us drunk
and locked us in a room together.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.483
Our hands were tied, literally!

07:22.567 --> 07:25.611
And if we're being honest here,
our love started first.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.072
Andre's the interloper.
We barely knew him in seventh grade.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.657
So this isn't our fault.

07:29.740 --> 07:33.411
So this is not what anyone
should be focused on or upset about,

07:33.494 --> 07:36.789
not with global warming
and… and drowning polar bears.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.792
That's what people should be upset about.
The polar bears, right?

07:41.294 --> 07:42.628
Are you talking to me?

07:43.337 --> 07:44.172
No.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.383
-Well, well, well.

07:47.467 --> 07:51.596
I spy with my little eye
a very big spiral. Guilty much?

07:51.679 --> 07:52.847
Andre, can we please talk?

07:52.930 --> 07:55.766
Two o'clock. I'd love to have
you and Cam on today's Dre-cast

07:55.850 --> 07:57.768
to hash things out publicly.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.145
Whore.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.273
How about privately after you wrap?

08:02.356 --> 08:04.108
How about no?

08:04.192 --> 08:06.652
Anything you have to say,
you can say in front of the Dre-niacs.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.947
At this point, I'm good in my feelings,
but they're out for blood.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.449
Andre, I wanna make things right,

08:11.532 --> 08:14.952
but I don't wanna fan the flames
of your followers' negative energy.

08:15.036 --> 08:18.247
So maybe it's better
if we just gave each other some space,

08:18.331 --> 08:20.541
and then we can reconnect
when cooler heads prevail?

08:22.418 --> 08:24.003
Boo!

08:26.839 --> 08:27.840
Bitch!

08:31.010 --> 08:33.387
We are gonna have a long talk
when I get home tonight,

08:33.471 --> 08:37.058
but until then,
go to your room, both of you!

08:40.937 --> 08:42.188
This is your fault!

08:42.271 --> 08:43.773
I'm not the one
who needs anger management.

08:43.856 --> 08:45.775
And I'm not the one
who needs loser management!

08:46.817 --> 08:49.195
That bad retort's gonna cost you 20

08:49.278 --> 08:51.656
on top of the 50
for today's school appearance.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.286
Of course the trash is full.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.108
-Hello?

09:27.191 --> 09:30.236
Demi, I think my dad is lying to me
about how sick he is.

09:30.319 --> 09:31.362
What? Why?

09:31.445 --> 09:33.739
At the party, I found a handwritten will,

09:33.823 --> 09:36.867
and now I just found a hospital bracelet
and a pamphlet for chemo.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.745
I think Cinnamon's premonition
might be about my dad's cancer.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.124
Slow down.
What premonition are you talking about?

09:43.624 --> 09:46.210
I haven't wanted to say it out loud
in case it makes it come true.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.045
I get that.
You're worried you'll manifest it.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.589
So I just wrote it in my BuJo.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.257
You wrote it down?

09:53.634 --> 09:56.721
Uh… Oh, I'll take this in the hall.

09:58.139 --> 10:01.100
Jesus Christ, Gloria.
That is so much worse.

10:01.183 --> 10:04.228
It's basic manifest logic.
You don't write down the bad shit.

10:04.312 --> 10:07.023
<i>It seals the fate.</i>
<i>When did Cinnamon give you a premonition?</i>

10:07.106 --> 10:08.733
When I went back into the house to pee.

10:08.816 --> 10:11.902
She stopped me, and then told me what
I don't wanna say but I did write down!

10:11.986 --> 10:15.114
Have you shown your BuJo
and the written premonition to anyone?

10:15.197 --> 10:16.365
-No.
-<i>Don't.</i>

10:17.491 --> 10:20.745
Demi, maybe all of this
has to do with the curse in the box.

10:20.828 --> 10:21.996
We need to find Mariluna.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.123
We can't expect her
to show up at the house again.

10:24.206 --> 10:25.625
<i>We have to go find her.</i>

10:25.708 --> 10:27.376
-But how?
-I don't know.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.295
But, Demi, do me a favor.

10:29.378 --> 10:31.380
<i>Keep an eye on Ines at school for me.</i>

10:34.383 --> 10:35.843
-I got you.
Thank you.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.560
-Why aren't you in class?
-Why aren't you?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.145
I'm the one asking the questions.

10:47.271 --> 10:50.483
Well, what's an education good for
when I'm destined for the pole?

10:50.983 --> 10:51.942
Oh, come on.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.278
You don't have the chest for it

10:54.362 --> 10:55.446
or, frankly, the rhythm.

10:55.529 --> 10:57.823
There's a lot of complex dancing
on the main stage.

10:57.907 --> 11:01.535
Great. Then I guess I'm destined
to be shitty at that too.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.163
What's going on?

11:04.246 --> 11:06.749
Where's your annoying, typical narcissism?

11:07.249 --> 11:09.418
I hit my bandwidth on being an asshole.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.253
Well, you're not one all the time.

11:12.421 --> 11:15.966
Okay, most of the time, but you get
some points for self-awareness.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.010
Oh, already feeling better.

11:18.886 --> 11:22.473
You need to get over
feeling guilty for Gloria's expulsion.

11:22.556 --> 11:24.016
You didn't do anything wrong.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.976
It's not like you did what I did.

11:26.602 --> 11:28.813
It's not like you broke up a relationship.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.690
Shit.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.484
I <i>am</i> a home-wrecker.

11:33.567 --> 11:36.904
I gotta own it.
I gotta go on that podcast.

11:36.987 --> 11:39.156
-It's a trap.
-It's not a trap.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.410
-Oh, right. It's an ambush.
-Isn't an ambush the same thing as a trap?

11:42.493 --> 11:46.122
Yes, which is why you can't do this.
All Andre does is trap and ambush us!

11:46.205 --> 11:48.499
I think Andre wants reconciliation.
He's a Libra.

11:48.582 --> 11:49.917
Don't do it.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.128
I have a really good feeling about this.

11:52.211 --> 11:55.464
So, do you think your insistence
upon stealing other people's men

11:55.548 --> 11:56.924
stems from your daddy issues?

11:57.967 --> 11:59.176
<i>Daddy, why?</i>

11:59.760 --> 12:01.637
Why are you hiding all this?

12:03.097 --> 12:04.557
Hey. What are you doing?

12:04.640 --> 12:06.392
-Nothing. What are you doing?
Nothing.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.355
Dad, sit down.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.315
Oh, sounds important.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.860
-No. Go to your room.
-No, I'm gonna stay here.

12:15.943 --> 12:18.446
Tonio, I need you
in this conversation too.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.490
Why does he get to stay, and I have to go?

12:21.574 --> 12:23.951
Ines, do as your sister says.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.161
I don't want to.

12:26.328 --> 12:27.371
<i>Ama,</i> please go.

12:30.916 --> 12:31.959
Dad, sit.

12:32.501 --> 12:35.629
How is it that you got expelled,
and I'm the one having a sit-down talk?

12:35.713 --> 12:37.715
Because you're lying about your cancer.

12:39.467 --> 12:43.262
And that's your top 20 things that you,
Demi, need to work on as a person.

12:43.345 --> 12:45.973
That doesn't feel constructive.
One of them was just my personality.

12:46.056 --> 12:48.934
Oh, don't worry. We're getting into
breaking them down into more detail.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.895
Is there any water?

12:51.604 --> 12:53.606
Do I look like a water boy?

12:54.315 --> 12:56.525
I actually don't know. Who are you?

12:56.609 --> 12:59.695
This is Benji, my new tech guy
slash potential new cohost.

12:59.779 --> 13:00.654
Next on the agenda,

13:00.738 --> 13:02.573
how you destroyed a lifetime of happiness,

13:02.656 --> 13:04.825
which included four or five kids
and/or pugs.

13:04.909 --> 13:08.204
Okay, I'm really sorry,
but honestly, this is enough.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.790
Really, is there any liquid in the room?

13:10.873 --> 13:15.085
-A sweaty pit reveals a guilty heart.
-Of course I feel guilty, Andre.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.296
I know what I did was wrong,
and I'm sorry.

13:17.379 --> 13:21.258
I can't emphasize how sorry I am,
but I didn't destroy your relationship.

13:21.342 --> 13:24.094
-You would've broken up eventually.
-I don't think so.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.514
We talked about our retirement summer home
in Lake Arrowhead.

13:26.597 --> 13:29.767
Okay, first of all, Cam must've not
been listening, because he hates lakes.

13:29.850 --> 13:33.020
-He thinks they're rivers who gave up.
-No. He would've told me that.

13:33.103 --> 13:35.940
Maybe he did tell you,
and you just didn't listen.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.234
Just like you haven't heard him
or seen any of the signs

13:38.317 --> 13:40.903
he's been trying
to break up with you for months.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.116
Now I know you're lying.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.493
No, I'm not.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.204
Remember when he gave you
that shitty wooden box?

13:50.287 --> 13:52.289
He was trying to give you
the worst present ever

13:52.373 --> 13:53.707
so that you'd break up with him.

13:53.791 --> 13:57.211
It even had the wrong initials on it,
but you just see what you wanna see.

13:57.711 --> 13:58.963
You're not lying.

14:01.465 --> 14:02.842
That's enough for today.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.933
I guess you're not the reason we ended.

14:11.642 --> 14:14.144
-I'm sorry.
-No, I needed to know.

14:15.145 --> 14:17.231
-Thank you for telling me.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.779
-Demi?
-Yes?

14:23.863 --> 14:26.323
You're still a home-wrecking whore.
Just not an evil one.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.368
If you aren't that sick,

14:29.451 --> 14:33.289
why are you spending $5,000
that you don't have on life insurance?

14:33.372 --> 14:36.542
Because I wanna ensure
that you're taken care of when I'm gone.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.002
See? I'm right!

14:42.089 --> 14:43.007
Wait. I'm…

14:44.508 --> 14:47.469
I'm right? Dad, how right am I?

14:49.138 --> 14:49.972
Stage-three right.

14:52.266 --> 14:53.601
Is that out of ten?

14:54.727 --> 14:55.686
Four.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.023
What does that mean?

14:59.106 --> 15:02.109
It just means we have limited time
to get Dad on a plan of attack.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.277
No.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.740
Short of experimental treatments,
which my insurance won't cover,

15:07.823 --> 15:09.658
and I can't afford…

15:10.701 --> 15:12.119
I'm sorry I lied to you.

15:14.663 --> 15:16.624
I just couldn't bring myself
to tell you the truth.

15:16.707 --> 15:20.044
No. There has to be something we can do.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.880
I love you, <i>mija.</i>

15:23.923 --> 15:26.216
But sometimes,
there's battles you just can't win.

15:31.055 --> 15:31.972
Hey.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.268
You okay? How are you feeling?

15:37.102 --> 15:39.396
You mean, since finding out
Dad's cancer has progressed

15:39.480 --> 15:40.981
and there's nothing we can do?

15:41.065 --> 15:45.194
There is always something to do.
We're gonna figure this out. I promise.

15:46.028 --> 15:46.862
Gloria,

15:48.155 --> 15:50.282
there's something that I need to tell you.

15:50.366 --> 15:53.410
-I don't know how to say this. I'm just--
-I need to tell you something first.

15:54.328 --> 15:58.874
Finding out tonight that Dad has been
keeping such a big secret to protect us,

15:58.958 --> 16:01.585
it made me realize
I'm doing the same thing.

16:01.669 --> 16:02.795
I'm trying to protect you.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.881
I'm not trying to lie to you
or hide things

16:05.965 --> 16:08.592
or seemingly fight your battles
like I did today.

16:09.176 --> 16:11.053
There's more to it than you know,
and I'm sorry,

16:11.136 --> 16:12.972
but that is all I can tell you right now.

16:14.139 --> 16:17.184
So you're telling me
that you're not telling me something.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.104
It's for your own good.

16:20.187 --> 16:23.065
Shouldn't I be the one
to decide what's for my own good?

16:23.148 --> 16:25.401
God, why does everyone
treat me like I'm a baby?

16:25.484 --> 16:27.569
Please, trust me.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.279
Do I even have another choice?

16:29.363 --> 16:31.615
You know, actually don't answer.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.659
I know. I don't.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.369
Wait.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.539
-What were you gonna tell me?
-It doesn't matter.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.333
I don't matter.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.686
<i>Hey, do you have a minute?</i>

17:00.769 --> 17:03.397
I really need to talk to someone
who will actually listen.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.190
Of course. Everything okay?

17:05.274 --> 17:08.110
<i>Not really,</i>
<i>but I don't wanna talk about that.</i>

17:08.694 --> 17:09.903
But I will talk about Gloria

17:09.987 --> 17:13.115
and how she treats me
like I just came out of the womb.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.868
She never lets me speak.
She sends me to my room.

17:15.951 --> 17:18.912
I mean, seriously, she won't even tell me
what she's not telling me

17:18.996 --> 17:20.664
because she's protecting me.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.166
Bullshit.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.586
-Gloria doesn't even like me.
-<i>Are you kidding?</i>

17:25.669 --> 17:27.337
Gloria is all about you.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.132
This morning, she literally
punched me in the face for you.

17:31.383 --> 17:32.926
She didn't do that for me.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.387
She did that for herself.

17:35.971 --> 17:37.598
What? What does that mean?

17:37.681 --> 17:38.766
Rusty,

17:38.849 --> 17:40.350
<i>you know what I mean.</i>

17:41.268 --> 17:42.811
I thought you said she didn't like me,

17:42.895 --> 17:44.688
<i>that I was pathetic.</i>

17:44.772 --> 17:45.606
I lied.

17:46.899 --> 17:47.900
Then why'd she hit me?

17:49.568 --> 17:51.111
Because I lied to her too.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.865
I'm just being the awful person
that everyone says I am.

17:54.948 --> 17:57.743
<i>Don't say that.</i>
<i>Don't put that out there.</i>

17:58.869 --> 18:01.830
You're just human, trying to figure it out
like the rest of us.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.416
Isn't that what the Manotaur always said?

18:05.125 --> 18:08.587
Yes, but it's a good life mantra.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.258
<i>Hey, can I call you back?</i>
<i>I gotta go.</i>

18:15.969 --> 18:17.387
Did you get my message?

18:17.930 --> 18:20.224
You can't quit. You can't quit now.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.559
Okay, I have to.
I'm sorry. It's getting complicated.

18:22.643 --> 18:26.480
Come on. I really need you.
So do the girls.

18:35.614 --> 18:36.824
Need to work on your form.

18:38.450 --> 18:42.037
Granny style is statistically
more accurate than overhand. Look it up.

18:44.039 --> 18:46.083
Did you come here
to give me basketball tips?

18:46.166 --> 18:48.669
'Cause I've seen you play, and you can't.

18:49.461 --> 18:52.714
So, I, uh, heard the podcast today.

18:56.468 --> 19:00.639
Look, Andre, I really wish things
had gone down differently.

19:02.850 --> 19:03.809
I'm sorry.

19:05.727 --> 19:08.939
Sorry for cheating on me,
or sorry you pretended to care about me?

19:09.022 --> 19:10.274
I wasn't pretending.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.609
If you wanted to break up months ago,
why didn't you?

19:12.693 --> 19:14.653
Because I'm bad at the things.

19:15.779 --> 19:19.199
Words, feelings, color coordination.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.078
Okay. You want the truth?

19:23.996 --> 19:25.831
-If you're even capable.
-Andre…

19:27.708 --> 19:30.252
I don't know how to like me like you do.

19:30.335 --> 19:33.005
-Spare me your narcissism.
-That's not what this is.

19:34.047 --> 19:35.757
Please, this is really hard for me.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.512
You're just so authentically you,

19:41.763 --> 19:43.557
all the time, for the whole world to see.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.267
And it's amazing, but

19:46.435 --> 19:48.395
it's also so intimidating…

19:50.731 --> 19:52.774
because I don't even know how to be me.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.986
So what are you trying to say?

19:56.069 --> 19:59.823
That I'm still figuring it all out,
which is scary

19:59.907 --> 20:02.743
and seemingly means nothing to you because

20:04.119 --> 20:06.121
you already have it all figured out.

20:08.040 --> 20:12.669
So did I wanna break up with you? Yes.
But do I also really care about you?

20:14.171 --> 20:15.005
Yes.

20:16.465 --> 20:19.927
Both those things are true.
Two things can be true at the same time.

20:20.010 --> 20:20.844
Agreed.

20:21.470 --> 20:22.429
I get it.

20:23.513 --> 20:24.389
I hear you.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.770
You know, since we've broken up,
I had some time to think.

20:30.270 --> 20:33.774
And I realized that I spent so much time
worrying about whether you liked me

20:34.900 --> 20:37.736
that I never stopped to think…
Do I like you?

20:40.572 --> 20:41.490
And I don't.

20:45.786 --> 20:46.912
Nailed it.

20:48.038 --> 20:49.039
Nothing but net.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.007
I'll tell Rusty you're still eating.

21:10.852 --> 21:11.687
Hi.

21:12.437 --> 21:13.689
Ines is taking a shit.

21:14.856 --> 21:17.192
She'll be out in four to six minutes.

21:19.736 --> 21:20.988
You mind if I…

21:27.411 --> 21:29.496
You didn't laugh,
so I feel I have to tell you.

21:29.579 --> 21:31.873
I was joking about Ines pooping.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.418
I'm actually glad you came out here.

21:35.210 --> 21:38.588
-I wanna tell you something.
-Wait! I have to say something first.

21:39.589 --> 21:40.716
I'm sorry I beat you up.

21:41.717 --> 21:42.926
You didn't beat me up.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.261
I did.

21:45.387 --> 21:46.972
But also, I'm not sorry,

21:47.472 --> 21:49.808
because you kissed me
and you shouldn't have.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.644
-Or I shouldn't have because--
-Because why?

21:52.728 --> 21:56.106
Because. This, us, it makes no sense.

21:57.774 --> 21:59.401
Is that how you really feel?

22:01.862 --> 22:02.821
What do you think?

22:04.323 --> 22:06.283
-Well, I think we could--
-Agreed!

22:06.908 --> 22:09.703
It was a mistake. We're not good together.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.581
So basically, I'm sorry I'm not sorry.

22:15.292 --> 22:16.585
What did you wanna say?

22:18.462 --> 22:19.921
I'm sorry you're not sorry.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.175
I thought we could've been good together.

22:35.645 --> 22:36.521
You ready?

22:53.413 --> 22:56.792
-What did I say about leaving the house?
-I was apologizing to Rusty--

22:56.875 --> 22:58.460
I don't care!

22:58.543 --> 23:01.838
Until we can get you back in school,
you're on house arrest!

23:01.922 --> 23:05.175
If you step outside again, being expelled
will be the least of your problems,

23:05.258 --> 23:08.095
'cause you'll be on your way to live
with your… …grandmother.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.347
Grandmother…
…lives in Mexico.

23:10.430 --> 23:12.057
Yes, and she's a devout Catholic,

23:12.140 --> 23:14.851
which means she's got ins
with nuns at the Catholic schools,

23:14.935 --> 23:17.437
where you'll be attending
and praying you never left the house<i>,</i>

23:18.271 --> 23:19.731
'cause those nuns hit.

23:20.732 --> 23:21.942
Have a good day.

23:35.122 --> 23:38.375
<i>Hey, Rusty, did I ever tell you</i>
<i>about the time I met my wife?</i>

23:38.458 --> 23:39.584
<i>You have a wife?</i>

23:39.668 --> 23:41.169
<i>Two, actually.</i>

23:41.253 --> 23:44.548
<i>A human wife and a horse wife,</i>

23:44.631 --> 23:46.258
<i>but I'm talking about the human.</i>

23:46.341 --> 23:49.886
<i>I was doing a guest lecture at Cornell</i>
<i>and spotted her in the crowd.</i>

23:49.970 --> 23:51.638
<i>I asked her out on the spot…</i>

24:09.531 --> 24:11.199
Ooh.

24:12.659 --> 24:13.493
Ew.

24:14.161 --> 24:14.995

25:12.594 --> 25:13.720
Oh shit.

25:14.804 --> 25:15.847
