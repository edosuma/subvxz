00:55.560 --> 00:56.607
Champagne time.

01:12.423 --> 01:18.881
Carson. Carson. Carson.

01:36.835 --> 01:39.552
Where's my woman?
Where's Rachel?

02:06.880 --> 02:07.992
Have fun with the boys.

02:08.158 --> 02:11.061
Come on, baby.
We can play teams.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.442
They' be shirts.

02:13.471 --> 02:15.674
We' be skins.

02:15.838 --> 02:19.864
Take it off! Take it off!

02:20.030 --> 02:21.240
Take it off!

02:36.764 --> 02:39.513
Carson, Carson.

02:40.187 --> 02:43.122
You're late, dude. I thought
for sure you'd chicken out...

02:43.292 --> 02:46.193
...after that pounding
I gave you last time.

02:47.227 --> 02:49.398
How about you put your money
where your mouth s?

02:49.563 --> 02:51.221
My money is everywhere, bitch.

02:52.314 --> 02:55.216
- How about 10,000?
- Carson, what are you doing?

02:55.930 --> 02:57.206
I'm just gonna show Shane...

02:57.370 --> 03:00.784
...why he should stick to hustling
flat-feet at Blue Bay Country Club.

03:00.953 --> 03:02.513
Where are you now? Par four?

03:04.601 --> 03:06.194
You're gonna race, aren't you?

03:06.360 --> 03:07.921
He's gonna race.

03:08.088 --> 03:11.350
- I'm gonna win.
- This is like Divorce Court.

03:11.512 --> 03:14.064
Only hotter.
What's it gonna be then, eh?

03:14.232 --> 03:16.436
- Race to Bird's Point?
- I know you drive...

03:16.600 --> 03:19.534
...like you're blind, but I'm sure
you can see I'm entertaining.

03:19.703 --> 03:23.051
- I have all day to feed you your lunch.
- The number four buoy?

03:23.223 --> 03:25.045
Can I talk to you for a minute?

03:26.422 --> 03:28.811
Sweetie, it'll take 10 minutes...

03:28.982 --> 03:31.666
...and then we'll play
that lawn bowling game you love.

03:31.829 --> 03:33.902
- You guys up for some bocce?
- Yeah!

03:34.070 --> 03:36.786
- Let's do it.
- Yeah.

03:41.876 --> 03:44.658
It's gonna be over before
the sun hits the first layer of SPF.

03:44.820 --> 03:47.853
- I might sit this one out.
- You're gonna chicken out?

03:48.020 --> 03:50.409
Sit out, not chicken out.

03:50.579 --> 03:52.652
I decided to take on a new skipper.

03:53.715 --> 03:57.064
- Brandi.
- Yeah!

04:05.202 --> 04:08.136
- You work at the race track?
- I gotta pay for school somehow.

04:10.065 --> 04:12.431
- What kind of shit are you pulling?
- Scared of a girl?

04:13.233 --> 04:15.654
I just don't wanna hear
your excuses later on.

04:15.824 --> 04:17.449
Don't worry about it.

04:17.616 --> 04:19.623
Smoke this fool.

04:20.944 --> 04:22.504
Careful with al that throttle.

04:25.104 --> 04:26.347
Oh, yeah.

04:26.511 --> 04:28.104
We should agree on a finish line.

04:28.271 --> 04:30.213
You'll know it's over
when I drop an anchor.

05:43.046 --> 05:43.994
Damn.

06:01.604 --> 06:02.553
Shit.

06:04.580 --> 06:05.528
Yeah!

06:08.643 --> 06:09.755
Damn it.

06:13.090 --> 06:14.039
Yeah!

06:14.210 --> 06:16.315
That's what I'm talking about.

06:22.818 --> 06:24.279
How about I buy you a drink?

06:24.449 --> 06:27.929
With all the money you just lost,
how about I buy you one?

06:38.943 --> 06:41.015
Stuben, are we home early?

06:41.727 --> 06:43.898
Stuben. Stuben.

06:44.063 --> 06:45.339
Coming.

06:46.719 --> 06:49.653
- Yes, sir.
- Are we home early?

06:50.366 --> 06:53.180
Few minutes. I noticed there
wasn't much traffic on the causeway.

06:53.341 --> 06:54.486
No, I mean from our trip.

06:54.654 --> 06:58.996
- Should we be back next week?
- Not that I know of. No, sir.

07:01.821 --> 07:05.432
Where does this kid get balls
big enough to do this to my property?

07:05.596 --> 07:09.873
Let me take care of this. Consider
staying in Bal Harbour tonight.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.590
That was a pretty bold turn.

07:13.755 --> 07:15.827
They say fortune favors the bold.

07:16.251 --> 07:19.599
That's what you owe us,
Wheetly, a fortune.

07:19.770 --> 07:21.712
So why are you following me again?

07:21.883 --> 07:22.865
You know her?

07:23.034 --> 07:25.270
- We grew up together.
- Sort of.

07:25.433 --> 07:27.670
Her mother cleaned our house.

07:29.113 --> 07:31.317
That's what's great
about this country, right?

07:31.481 --> 07:33.423
We all end up sharing a beer.

07:33.593 --> 07:35.797
Carson, you don't even know
this girl.

07:36.473 --> 07:37.901
I know how she drives a boat.

07:38.072 --> 07:39.414
Where'd you learn that?

07:39.576 --> 07:41.332
My old man.

07:41.816 --> 07:44.466
- He a captain?
- He was a fisherman.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.867
- He was a lowlife.
- Rach, lighten up.

07:47.448 --> 07:51.757
You know what? Screw you
and this Jerry Springer reject.

07:52.214 --> 07:54.548
Rachel. Rachel.

07:54.710 --> 07:55.954
Shit.

07:56.886 --> 07:59.504
Dude. you got me into this.
Can you help me out?

08:00.245 --> 08:03.823
Fine. But you owe me. Rach.

08:14.931 --> 08:18.127
I want this entire house
arrested for trespassing.

08:18.291 --> 08:19.502
Get off my couch.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.740
They were invited in, sir.

08:22.291 --> 08:24.363
Stuben, how much
do I give the cops every year?

08:24.530 --> 08:26.635
I don't have the exact figure
n front of me, sir...

08:26.803 --> 08:29.869
...but it's large.
- Well, call Captain What's-His-Name.

08:30.034 --> 08:32.073
- Blanchard.
- Tell him it's payback time.

08:32.241 --> 08:35.503
Let's just tow the cars. It's a lot easier
than getting the cops involved.

08:35.664 --> 08:38.217
- Hey, you wanna wait up?
- Hey, Hendricks.

08:39.089 --> 08:40.779
What the hell are you doing
in my home?

08:41.489 --> 08:42.698
Carson invited me.

08:44.944 --> 08:46.766
Stubie.

08:57.903 --> 09:00.074
So your dad was a fisherman.

09:00.239 --> 09:02.955
He was the best.
He had a small boat.

09:03.118 --> 09:05.704
It was in the family for generations.

09:06.382 --> 09:08.137
He loved the water.

09:09.005 --> 09:10.696
So does my father.

09:12.109 --> 09:16.419
Boats, race cars and houses.
And not so much a fan of people.

09:17.421 --> 09:20.737
It's because they scuff his floors
and steal his booze.

09:21.580 --> 09:23.652
Must be why he buys so many.

09:25.196 --> 09:26.472
Cars and houses, that is.

09:32.746 --> 09:35.648
- Carson!
- Oh, busted. Big man's here.

09:35.818 --> 09:37.792
Seriously.

09:38.314 --> 09:40.452
Speak of the devil.

09:48.904 --> 09:50.017
What's up, Pops?

09:52.776 --> 09:55.972
If fucking up were a desirable skill,
you would be president right now.

09:57.639 --> 10:00.224
Well, if being an arrogant asshole
was equally valued...

10:00.391 --> 10:02.213
...you'd be my vice.

10:03.495 --> 10:05.884
- This is not your frat house.
- Got the foosball table.

10:06.055 --> 10:08.421
Come on, Carson.
What am I doing wrong here?

10:10.374 --> 10:11.617
I don't know, Ted.

10:12.934 --> 10:15.617
Maybe if Mom was still alive,
she could help.

10:19.972 --> 10:21.827
Is that why you invited
Shane Hendricks?

10:21.989 --> 10:23.450
Just to piss me off?

10:23.620 --> 10:26.751
Just because his dad tried
to screw you out of a lot of money...

10:26.916 --> 10:28.443
...a long time ago...
- Did.

10:28.611 --> 10:31.328
He did screw me out
of a whole lot of money.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.041
Well, it hasn't slowed you down much,
has it?

10:37.059 --> 10:38.847
I'm gonna stay at Bal Harbour tonight.

10:39.011 --> 10:41.051
Poor Dad. Slumming it as usual.

10:41.218 --> 10:44.120
Hardly. But you will be.

10:44.290 --> 10:47.638
If this place isn't empty and clean
by the time I get back in the morning...

10:49.089 --> 10:50.202
...I will cut you off.

10:50.786 --> 10:52.214
Prom se.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.239
Stop cheating.

11:09.407 --> 11:11.643
Oh, yeah? How do you like that?

11:12.287 --> 11:14.490
- You talk a pretty good game.
- I play a good game.

11:16.254 --> 11:17.563
All right.

11:17.726 --> 11:20.213
Look. et me show you
how it's done, okay?

11:25.821 --> 11:27.282
Now, shoot.

11:28.413 --> 11:29.689
See?

11:30.364 --> 11:31.891
You beat me.

11:32.061 --> 11:33.849
How about a rematch?

11:35.420 --> 11:38.518
I don't wanna embarrass myself
all over again.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.060
Easy there.

11:48.731 --> 11:53.237
Why don't you let me win
something for a change?

11:53.945 --> 11:55.571
Like what?

11:57.722 --> 11:59.860
A kissing contest.

12:29.077 --> 12:31.630
Go. Let's go, Blue Bay.

12:31.797 --> 12:34.033
Blue. Go. Let's go, Blue Bay.

12:34.197 --> 12:37.197
It was like everybody could see them,
and no one's paying attention.

12:37.365 --> 12:39.852
I'm telling you, she is such a skank.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.507
- And you're sure he kissed her.
- Positive.

12:43.060 --> 12:44.401
She's finished in Blue Bay.

12:44.563 --> 12:46.832
What are you gonna do about him?

12:48.915 --> 12:51.882
- What do you want?
- To spoil my baby.

12:52.050 --> 12:53.392
Give them to your whore.

12:53.554 --> 12:56.042
What?
Baby, what are you talking about?

12:56.210 --> 12:59.625
Come on, Carson.
I know what you did last night.

12:59.794 --> 13:01.648
- I got drunk.
- Oh, and you just jammed...

13:01.809 --> 13:03.882
...your tongue down
some chick's throat?

13:05.937 --> 13:06.951
Who told you that?

13:07.121 --> 13:09.161
Are you kidding?
I knew every girl there.

13:10.257 --> 13:13.671
- Which one of you said that?
- I did. I saw you.

13:15.375 --> 13:17.033
Are you gonna deny it?

13:17.199 --> 13:19.304
I don't know. I might've kissed her.

13:19.471 --> 13:20.681
I was drunk.

13:20.847 --> 13:24.905
Shit, baby, do you think that meant
anything to me, one stupid kiss?

13:25.998 --> 13:27.624
Do you believe me?

13:27.791 --> 13:31.303
Because without your trust,
I'm nothing.

13:33.326 --> 13:35.300
I asked if you believe me.

13:35.470 --> 13:37.160
So are we good?

13:38.509 --> 13:44.041
If I find out that you did more than
just kiss her, I'll chop your nuts off.

13:45.196 --> 13:46.625
That's what I love about you.

13:46.797 --> 13:50.145
Excuse me. Sorry.
Mr. Wheetly, the police are here...

13:50.316 --> 13:51.876
...and they need to talk to you.

13:52.044 --> 13:53.986
Let me guess.
about your little boat race?

13:54.155 --> 13:56.228
Can you come with me, please?

13:56.395 --> 13:58.184
Excuse me, ladies.

14:06.665 --> 14:08.836
Officer, let me assure you...

14:09.001 --> 14:12.317
...whatever you heard, I was not racing
my motorboat this weekend.

14:12.489 --> 14:13.950
Carson.

14:14.121 --> 14:18.343
Jesus. They got you here too?
What's the charge?

14:18.984 --> 14:20.544
Carson, it's your father.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.880
What about him?

14:53.284 --> 14:55.106
He didn't make it.

14:59.779 --> 15:01.535
It's okay.

15:01.699 --> 15:03.292
We will get through this.

15:14.434 --> 15:15.895
Detective.

15:16.577 --> 15:17.525
Detective Walker.

15:21.505 --> 15:23.359
- You find him?
- He wasn't at home.

15:23.521 --> 15:26.422
Answering machine said
he wouldn't be back till the 25th.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.250
That's next week.

15:28.416 --> 15:31.449
Yeah. I know when it is. Thanks.

15:35.519 --> 15:38.453
Frank, what the hell
is going on here?

15:38.623 --> 15:40.727
This guy must be really important...

15:40.894 --> 15:43.829
...for you to leave your cushy chair
and your view of the heliport.

15:43.998 --> 15:45.656
He's the ninth richest man
in Florida.

15:46.558 --> 15:48.565
Judging by all the pieces
he was blown into...

15:48.734 --> 15:50.806
...I'd say he was five of them.

15:51.293 --> 15:53.333
This is why we don't let him
talk to reporters.

15:53.917 --> 15:57.331
They say that the most dangerous
place in all of Blue Bay...

15:57.500 --> 15:59.988
...s right between Captain Blanchard
and a microphone.

16:00.156 --> 16:01.847
- You got a cigarette?
- No. I quit.

16:02.012 --> 16:03.768
Yeah, me, too. Ten years ago.

16:03.932 --> 16:06.801
But the smell of motor oil...
My dad used to have a shop.

16:06.971 --> 16:08.727
- I worked for him in the summers.
- Frank.

16:08.891 --> 16:10.484
Yeah.

16:12.219 --> 16:14.553
How soon can you wrap up?
The press is al over this.

16:14.715 --> 16:15.991
- It depends.
- On what?

16:16.154 --> 16:18.707
On how soon we can figure out
what the hell this thing is.

16:18.874 --> 16:21.939
See, it’s too old to be on a car
that new. And you see that?

16:22.553 --> 16:24.080
That's rust.

16:24.249 --> 16:26.900
It's not charring from an explosion.
This is an old part.

16:27.065 --> 16:30.228
Maybe it's part of some
special racing modification.

16:30.392 --> 16:33.654
Hey, you got any idea why a part
that old would be on a car this new?

16:33.817 --> 16:36.816
Not that I know of. But I don't work
on it, so I can't say for sure.

16:36.984 --> 16:39.439
- Who can we ask?
- Chuck Hensler. He's Ted's mechanic.

16:39.607 --> 16:42.128
But he and his family are out
on vacation till the 25th.

16:42.295 --> 16:44.019
- When is that?
- Next week.

16:44.183 --> 16:45.808
Yeah. It's the day after the 24th.

16:46.935 --> 16:50.000
Send it to Forensics, and we'll wait
on this Hensler fellow, okay?

16:51.446 --> 16:52.875
Good deal.

16:56.309 --> 16:59.091
And we pray the loss is balanced
by thanksgiving...

16:59.605 --> 17:02.801
...for the life that was shared with us.
Amen.

17:02.965 --> 17:04.492
Amen.

17:07.540 --> 17:09.001
I'm sorry.

17:11.188 --> 17:12.648
I'm sorry.

17:26.930 --> 17:30.158
Let him be alone for a second.
I'll go talk to him.

17:37.936 --> 17:40.140
Everything is gonna be okay,
Carson.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.687
My mom'll kill herself again...

17:44.848 --> 17:47.848
...when she finds out
she has to spend eternity next to him.

17:48.015 --> 17:49.804
Even if it is just his ashes.

17:49.967 --> 17:52.006
Maybe they'll make up in heaven.

17:53.167 --> 17:55.501
Or fight like dogs in hell.

17:58.382 --> 18:01.448
Carson, I know
this is an awful time, but...

18:01.614 --> 18:04.396
...there are some things
we need to discuss when you're ready.

18:06.541 --> 18:08.199
You mean the will?

18:11.980 --> 18:14.314
George, can you give me
a few days?

18:14.476 --> 18:16.069
I don't think I can right now.

18:16.236 --> 18:18.952
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
take as long as you need.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.243
Just a few days is all.

18:22.411 --> 18:27.266
Yeah. whatever.
Okay. Good. Okay.

18:48.872 --> 18:51.905
Well, what I'm about to say
may seem like a shock...

18:52.072 --> 18:54.722
...but in time, I think
you'll come to see it's a gift.

18:56.199 --> 18:57.922
Not gonna tell me
he left everything...

18:58.087 --> 18:59.909
...to a quarter horse
named Pole Dancer.

19:00.071 --> 19:03.420
Knowing your father, it would have
been a dolphin named Flipper.

19:04.614 --> 19:08.476
Your father put all the money in a trust
for you and named me the executor.

19:08.646 --> 19:10.401
And, as per the trust rules...

19:10.565 --> 19:14.842
...I can take a limited amount out
for living expenses...

19:15.013 --> 19:17.827
...but you won't receive
the balance until you're 30.

19:18.468 --> 19:20.442
How's that possible?

19:20.932 --> 19:23.714
I saw the will when my mother died.
It didn't have any of this.

19:23.875 --> 19:26.777
No, it didn't. But he revised it.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.224
You're joking, right?

19:29.187 --> 19:30.299
I'm afraid not.

19:30.467 --> 19:33.249
Are you kidding me?
Minimal expenses?

19:33.763 --> 19:35.224
So what does that mean?

19:35.394 --> 19:37.914
We'll run the house
and pay for your car insurance.

19:39.010 --> 19:41.759
Anything else,
you'll have to earn yourself.

19:41.921 --> 19:44.343
This has got to be
a fucking joke now.

19:44.865 --> 19:47.232
Baby, listen, it's okay.
We'll make do.

19:47.872 --> 19:49.465
What about food or anything else?

19:49.633 --> 19:51.902
There's no way
to get any more money.

19:52.064 --> 19:54.781
Sure. There's some exceptions.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.634
In case of a medical emergency...

19:56.800 --> 19:59.702
...if you wanna go back to school
or if you wanna get married...

19:59.872 --> 20:02.424
...or if you...
- Married?

20:02.591 --> 20:04.762
Yeah, yeah.
There is a provision in the trust...

20:04.927 --> 20:08.156
...that does give me a little leeway
on distributing the funds.

20:08.319 --> 20:10.555
I can do as I see ft
to promote the marriage.

20:11.230 --> 20:13.499
Well, I'm not getting married.

20:17.981 --> 20:20.948
Rachel. Rach.

20:22.684 --> 20:24.059
It's not that I don't love you.

20:24.221 --> 20:27.090
- It's just that I feel like...
- But what, Carson? You're a jerk.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.977
You know what?
I didn't wanna marry you either.

20:30.140 --> 20:33.107
But I just wish you didn't say no
so quickly.

20:33.276 --> 20:35.828
It's like I'm some sort
of disgusting person or something.

20:35.995 --> 20:37.621
- It's not that.
- Don't touch me.

20:39.258 --> 20:41.266
You don't deserve me.

20:48.986 --> 20:51.571
Would you put anything like this
in Ted's car?

20:51.737 --> 20:53.395
We didn't use nothing old
in that car.

20:53.561 --> 20:56.528
Shit, Ted didn't even use
the same steering wheel twice.

20:56.921 --> 20:58.928
You have a lot of girls
working the pit crews?

20:59.097 --> 21:01.879
More and more. Shane Hendricks'
got a girl working for him.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.185
And a sexy one, too.

21:03.351 --> 21:06.700
You have no idea how this wound up
underneath Ted Wheetly's hood?

21:06.872 --> 21:08.781
- I might.
- You might.

21:08.952 --> 21:12.268
Well, see, since I knew you was
coming, I pulled some records.

21:12.438 --> 21:15.220
The night before the crash,
Ted Wheetly's car ended up...

21:15.382 --> 21:16.691
...n Shane Hendricks' garage.

21:16.854 --> 21:19.221
- And that's unusual, why?
- It never happens.

21:19.382 --> 21:21.170
- Never happens?
- Never.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.984
Especially since Ted hated
Shane and his father.

21:24.150 --> 21:27.498
- We weren't allowed to say their name.
- Hang on. They hated each other.

21:27.669 --> 21:28.814
- Why?
- I don't know.

21:28.981 --> 21:31.730
- You don't know.
- Look, man, I just fix the cars, okay?

21:31.892 --> 21:33.452
They don't tell me the secrets.

21:33.620 --> 21:35.529
How did the car wind up
n Shane's garage?

21:35.700 --> 21:36.780
Beats me. It just did.

21:39.252 --> 21:41.804
- Can I go in there?
- Yes, sir.

21:46.034 --> 21:48.041
Got any lights in this place?

21:52.594 --> 21:55.409
- Quaint little garage.
- The best that money can buy.

21:55.570 --> 21:58.057
- Everything in here is.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:58.225 --> 21:59.850
Come on, you're a smart guy.
Te me.

22:00.017 --> 22:04.010
Who could arrange for Wheetly's car
to spend the night in a place like this?

22:05.968 --> 22:07.790
- Fuck.
- Afraid you're gonna lose your job?

22:07.952 --> 22:10.505
I'll take you to jai.
Who can arrange it?

22:11.344 --> 22:13.483
Shane's the only one who can do it.

22:13.935 --> 22:15.790
This is his space.

22:22.926 --> 22:24.519
How can I see what that thing sees?

22:35.629 --> 22:37.898
This is where we keep
all the surveillance tapes.

22:38.061 --> 22:40.362
I wanna see the night before
Wheetly's car blew.

22:40.524 --> 22:42.411
Yes, sir.

22:48.683 --> 22:50.276
All right. Here we go.

23:03.978 --> 23:07.239
- What was that? Did you see that?
- Yeah, let me back it up.

23:07.721 --> 23:08.670
Right there.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.979
The time code just jumped
two hours.

23:11.528 --> 23:13.535
When you say the time code
jumped two hours...

23:13.704 --> 23:15.329
...you mean it erased two hours?

23:15.496 --> 23:19.457
Possibly. This system
does randomly erase materials...

23:19.624 --> 23:22.820
Hang on. Hang on a second.
You're telling me...

23:22.983 --> 23:25.154
...that on this once-in-a-m lion
night...

23:25.319 --> 23:27.228
...that I wanna see,
two hours of footage...

23:27.399 --> 23:30.213
...this system randomly erased?
- It was possible.

23:30.374 --> 23:31.716
But not likely.

23:31.878 --> 23:34.692
Tell me something. Who other
than the guards has access...

23:34.854 --> 23:38.236
...to this particular system?
- Just Shane Hendricks.

23:38.821 --> 23:40.512
Just Shane Hendricks.

23:40.677 --> 23:42.051
Yeah.

23:44.356 --> 23:47.487
Looks like you
are not going to jail, my friend.

24:03.522 --> 24:04.504
What?

24:04.674 --> 24:08.022
Rach, please, come out here
and talk to me.

24:08.194 --> 24:10.911
Okay. What?

24:14.849 --> 24:16.987
You lock yourself
in the bedroom for six hours.

24:18.753 --> 24:21.622
I know. I'm sorry.
I was furious at you.

24:23.232 --> 24:25.141
It's not that I don't wanna marry you.

24:25.535 --> 24:27.869
It's just that we're so young.

24:28.031 --> 24:29.592
We have plenty of time.

24:30.271 --> 24:33.141
I know. I'm sorry.

24:33.310 --> 24:35.863
I'm sorry I was acting crazy.

24:36.031 --> 24:37.754
I just can't help it sometimes.

24:42.398 --> 24:43.346
Don't do that again.

24:44.125 --> 24:45.586
I won't.

25:00.347 --> 25:02.103
Close your eyes.

25:04.315 --> 25:08.919
And think about what I'm gonna
do to you when I get back.

25:17.209 --> 25:20.438
- Carson Wheetly, you're under arrest.
- For what?

25:20.921 --> 25:23.703
For the rape of Brand Cox.
Come on, let's go.

25:23.865 --> 25:24.813
- Rape?
- She's a liar.

25:24.985 --> 25:26.708
Yeah. Gotta take him in. Let's go.

25:26.872 --> 25:28.781
Let's go. Come on.

25:28.952 --> 25:30.064
Call George.

25:30.232 --> 25:32.501
- Keep moving.
- Call George.

25:32.664 --> 25:34.093
This way.

25:46.262 --> 25:50.385
Coming forward was the hardest
decision a girl like me could make.

25:50.550 --> 25:52.786
But I've a ways been a fighter...

25:52.949 --> 25:55.764
...and this is the most important
fight of my life.

25:56.980 --> 25:58.638
Carson Wheetly raped me.

26:00.501 --> 26:02.093
And just because he's rich...

26:02.260 --> 26:05.129
...does not mean
he can get away with it.

26:05.300 --> 26:08.169
And I'd also like to thank
Linda Dobson...

26:08.339 --> 26:12.561
...who saw it a happen
and had the courage to speak out.

26:27.217 --> 26:28.461
George, where have you been?

26:28.625 --> 26:29.999
I got here as soon as I could.

26:30.160 --> 26:31.370
I made a few phone calls.

26:31.536 --> 26:33.707
They can release you
on bail tomorrow morning.

26:33.872 --> 26:35.847
George, I'm innocent.
I swear to God.

26:36.016 --> 26:38.089
We got drunk and kissed,
but that's it.

26:38.255 --> 26:40.972
Girl would say anything
to get her claws on Carson's money.

26:41.135 --> 26:44.430
I just wish we could pay her off.
I mean, this thing could go on forever.

26:44.591 --> 26:48.551
- Who knows how a jury will respond?
- Can't we use some of the money?

26:48.718 --> 26:52.100
George, I'm fighting for my life here.
My dad would've understood.

26:52.270 --> 26:55.368
Of course,
but my hands are still tied.

26:55.533 --> 26:59.689
The terms are clear. They don't leave
a lot of room for improvisation.

26:59.853 --> 27:02.853
Marriage, medical emergency,
schooling.

27:03.373 --> 27:05.128
Well...

27:07.500 --> 27:10.249
I guess we have to get married.
That's what you're saying.

27:10.412 --> 27:14.503
I wasn't, no. I mean, suppose it would
make an easier case for the payout...

27:14.668 --> 27:18.497
...hard to have much of a marriage
with Carson in jai, but there's no...

27:25.770 --> 27:28.585
Baby, I don't want you to do
anything you don't wanna do.

27:33.929 --> 27:34.877
I want to.

27:35.497 --> 27:37.122
You're my everything.

27:42.408 --> 27:44.447
And you're my everything, baby.

27:44.872 --> 27:47.293
You two deserve
some happiness, a one.

27:48.008 --> 27:49.895
I'll make the arrangements.

28:01.766 --> 28:06.042
Brandi, what would you say
to a settlement offer?

28:07.429 --> 28:10.211
A part of me would say,
"Go fuck yourself, asshole."

28:10.373 --> 28:12.412
You don't know
what I've been through.

28:12.580 --> 28:15.809
- And the other part?
- The other part would say $25 million.

28:15.972 --> 28:17.881
You gold-digging bitch.

28:18.052 --> 28:19.361
Thirty? Thirty-five?

28:19.524 --> 28:22.077
What number would hurt you
as much as you hurt me, Carson?

28:22.243 --> 28:23.804
- Choke on it.
- Enough.

28:23.971 --> 28:27.615
Okay, enough. Enough.
We're offering 2 million.

28:28.579 --> 28:30.401
That's an insult. I talked to the DA.

28:30.562 --> 28:33.431
He is chomping
at the bit to prosecute.

28:33.602 --> 28:35.358
With what? A "he said, she said?"

28:35.522 --> 28:37.016
"He said, she said?"

28:37.185 --> 28:40.480
Linda Dobson swears she saw
your guy getting rough with Brandi.

28:40.641 --> 28:43.096
P ease, I got six guys
who'll swear she was so drunk...

28:43.265 --> 28:45.053
...she tried to make
out with a beer keg.

28:45.216 --> 28:48.151
You've got a 50 percent chance.
I'm offering you a sure thing.

28:48.320 --> 28:50.557
Even if she settles,
the DA can still prosecute.

28:50.720 --> 28:53.534
It's in your best interest
to make sure that doesn't happen.

28:54.240 --> 28:57.535
Once the charges are dropped,
we'll offer...

29:04.095 --> 29:06.004
- We'll make it 3 million.
- I want 10.

29:06.174 --> 29:09.751
- In your dreams.
- Careful, Carson.

29:09.917 --> 29:13.529
A nice butt like that, you're gonna be
very popular with the boys in the yard.

29:13.694 --> 29:17.523
You've already committed perjury.
Let's stay away from extortion.

29:17.692 --> 29:19.797
How about 5?

29:24.155 --> 29:27.635
That's $100,000. I won't even
hold it against the 5 million.

29:56.312 --> 29:58.068
- Checking in, ma'am?
- Bet your ass I am.

29:58.232 --> 30:00.949
- Do you have any bags?
- Just this.

30:26.837 --> 30:29.870
Jesus Christ,
you could've killed me.

30:30.548 --> 30:32.140
Innocent until proven guilty.

30:33.108 --> 30:35.180
You are guilty. Guilty as hell.

30:35.988 --> 30:37.035
Just as much as you are.

30:40.723 --> 30:41.705
How'd you get in here?

30:41.875 --> 30:43.598
It's my father's hotel.

30:43.763 --> 30:45.867
I've got the keys to the kingdom,
thanks to you.

30:48.146 --> 30:49.739
I could definitely get used to this.

30:50.609 --> 30:51.984
You better.

30:57.681 --> 30:59.273
When does the money
get transferred?

30:59.440 --> 31:00.389
A month.

31:00.945 --> 31:03.017
Paperwork and shit.

31:03.824 --> 31:06.671
I still can't believe the bastard
changed his will.

31:07.408 --> 31:09.262
Enough bus ness.

31:09.903 --> 31:13.383
Let's focus on pleasure.

31:25.038 --> 31:26.947
I wish we could have gotten more.

31:27.118 --> 31:31.492
That little bitch, I just wanted
to smack that smile off his face.

31:33.100 --> 31:35.173
He's not a bad guy.

31:35.340 --> 31:38.602
He just got this crazy
sense of loyalty to my old man.

31:39.755 --> 31:41.577
And me too, I guess.

31:43.755 --> 31:45.860
What are you complaining about?

31:46.027 --> 31:48.132
You've got a beautiful fiancée.

31:48.298 --> 31:49.542
A smoking-hot girlfriend.

31:49.706 --> 31:52.455
And a bunch of running-around
money. That's evil shit.

31:52.618 --> 31:54.506
Criminal.

31:55.146 --> 31:57.535
Almost as bad as setting
someone up for rape.

34:32.438 --> 34:34.413
Man, oh, man.

34:36.599 --> 34:39.795
Shane Hendricks?
I'm Detective Frank Walker.

34:39.958 --> 34:42.030
I'm investigating
the death of Ted Wheetly.

34:42.197 --> 34:43.474
I thought it was an accident.

34:43.638 --> 34:47.947
Yeah, I thought it was too, but a lot
of strange shit going on. Funny things.

34:48.821 --> 34:51.155
Why I et the man I hate
store his car in my garage.

34:51.317 --> 34:54.186
- Yeah, that's one of them.
- Because Brandi Cox asked me to.

34:55.315 --> 34:57.290
- You know Brand Cox?
- Sure.

34:57.460 --> 34:58.987
She worked my crew
for six months.

34:59.155 --> 35:02.155
Girl could strip an engine
in five minutes.

35:02.324 --> 35:04.079
Plus she looked good covered in oil.

35:04.243 --> 35:06.348
What about Linda Dobson?
Do you know her too?

35:07.059 --> 35:09.230
- From around, sure.
- You've seen her lately?

35:09.811 --> 35:10.759
Nope.

35:11.858 --> 35:13.833
Tel me something, Shane.

35:14.002 --> 35:17.036
Why in the world would Brandi Cox
want Ted Wheetly's car...

35:17.201 --> 35:19.208
...stored in your fancy garage?

35:19.377 --> 35:21.319
She didn't say and I didn't care.

35:21.489 --> 35:25.350
Don't say no to a hot piece of ass
like that. That illegal, detective?

35:26.321 --> 35:27.269
Maybe.

35:27.441 --> 35:29.513
I got into a lot of trouble
when I was a kid.

35:29.680 --> 35:32.746
Stupid things. Boosting cars,
some pot, nothing big.

35:32.912 --> 35:36.588
- But I did learn one thing.
- Really? What's that?

35:36.751 --> 35:39.468
Cops are a bunch of assholes.

35:40.911 --> 35:43.780
You can call my attorney
if you wanna talk again.

35:44.686 --> 35:46.791
"Cops are a bunch of assholes."

35:46.958 --> 35:49.227
Stupid fucking hat.

36:12.331 --> 36:15.364
- You're not the pizza guy.
- No, I'm Detective Frank Walker.

36:15.531 --> 36:17.538
I'd like to ask you
a few questions if I might.

36:17.707 --> 36:19.943
Sure. Want a drink?

36:22.313 --> 36:25.030
Thanks. It's hot out here.

36:27.881 --> 36:31.296
- That's very interesting iced tea.
- My mom's recipe.

36:31.464 --> 36:33.537
Only thing she ever gave me.

36:34.664 --> 36:36.552
Anyways, detective.
what can I do for you?

36:37.224 --> 36:40.093
I wanted to ask you about your
relationship with Shane Hendricks.

36:41.671 --> 36:44.060
- He was my boss.
- That's it?

36:44.807 --> 36:47.709
- Yes.
- But he wanted more?

36:48.103 --> 36:49.629
I suppose.

36:50.758 --> 36:52.546
And you used that to get favors.

36:52.710 --> 36:54.947
No. Never asked him for anything.

36:55.110 --> 36:58.306
He told me that you asked him
to keep Ted's car in his garage.

36:59.141 --> 37:00.832
He told me the only reason
he agreed...

37:00.997 --> 37:02.907
...was because
you were such a pretty girl.

37:04.804 --> 37:07.226
I doubt he used the words
"pretty girl."

37:07.396 --> 37:09.698
Actually, I'd put money
on "hot piece of ass."

37:10.916 --> 37:12.803
And be that the case, detective,
and...

37:12.964 --> 37:15.898
...I used to think this was the hottest
piece of ass in Glade City.

37:16.067 --> 37:18.816
But even if I did ask him,
there's no way Shane Hendricks...

37:18.979 --> 37:20.735
...would ever do anything
for Wheetly.

37:20.899 --> 37:22.655
Why is that?

37:24.674 --> 37:26.813
Because Ted hated Shane's pops.

37:26.978 --> 37:29.628
I hear he wanted to kill him
over some bad deal in the Keys.

37:32.385 --> 37:34.173
Well, I'll have to look into that.

37:35.937 --> 37:37.366
Thank you.

37:41.665 --> 37:43.836
Hey, one more thing.

37:45.216 --> 37:47.582
Do you ever talk
to Linda Dobson at all?

37:48.320 --> 37:50.741
No, I haven't.
I don't really know her.

37:51.935 --> 37:53.363
Right.

37:54.015 --> 37:55.258
Yeah.

37:55.422 --> 37:58.389
Well, thanks for your time.

38:09.373 --> 38:10.780
We need to talk.

38:24.412 --> 38:26.615
This better be important enough
to ruin my updo.

38:26.779 --> 38:28.056
I got a little spooked, okay?

38:28.570 --> 38:31.767
A detective came to my house,
I started thinking I could go to jail.

38:32.570 --> 38:34.545
We're in this together.
We could all go.

38:34.714 --> 38:37.780
That's bull shit. Okay, you have
a house and a brand-new Mercedes.

38:37.946 --> 38:40.880
I'm stuck living in a shack
with leaky pipes and water stains.

38:42.489 --> 38:46.002
You are set for life. If he dies,
you inherit everything.

38:46.169 --> 38:49.267
You're screwing me. can fee it.

38:49.432 --> 38:51.220
No, Brandi.

38:51.384 --> 38:53.686
That's so not true.

38:54.487 --> 38:55.894
I haven't seen you in days.

38:56.888 --> 38:58.797
Brandi, you knew
it was gonna be like this.

38:58.967 --> 39:01.488
Yeah, but I didn't think
it was gonna be this hard.

39:01.654 --> 39:04.621
I'm all alone, okay?
You're out getting married.

39:04.790 --> 39:07.278
Okay. This is the only way...

39:07.446 --> 39:09.453
...that we could get you
some money right now.

39:09.622 --> 39:13.997
And then, when Carson turns 30,
we hit the jackpot.

39:15.925 --> 39:16.874
Come here.

39:21.524 --> 39:23.597
You believe me, don't you?

39:41.650 --> 39:43.373
I'd like to introduce to you all...

39:43.537 --> 39:46.254
...Mr. and Mrs. Carson Wheetly.

40:04.463 --> 40:05.478
Who needs a drink?

40:09.743 --> 40:11.237
Happy, healthy...

40:11.407 --> 40:12.967
Wealthy and wise.

40:13.135 --> 40:14.957
Mrs. Wheetly.

40:19.661 --> 40:23.752
I just wanted to say that even though
we did this for practical reasons...

40:25.197 --> 40:27.084
...I’m really glad.

40:27.244 --> 40:29.033
I love you.

40:34.411 --> 40:36.931
Baby, I love you too.

40:37.675 --> 40:39.977
We're gonna be so happy.

40:41.995 --> 40:44.711
What do you think we should do,
now that we're marred?

40:45.130 --> 40:46.079
I don't know.

40:46.250 --> 40:51.268
Should we open our gifts and see
how many blenders we got?

40:51.978 --> 40:53.985
I was thinking of something
a little more fun.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.480
Like wine glasses.

40:56.649 --> 40:57.826
A margarita set?

41:11.975 --> 41:14.463
What asshole
do you think forgot his keys?

41:16.615 --> 41:19.036
Call the valet, dickhead.

41:21.190 --> 41:22.618
Is this a bad time?

41:22.790 --> 41:24.219
Are you here to arrest me again?

41:24.390 --> 41:25.818
It's hotter than hell out here.

41:25.989 --> 41:28.127
Do you mind if I come in
and talk for a while?

41:31.748 --> 41:34.115
What can I help you with, detective?

41:34.692 --> 41:37.114
There's been some developments
in your father's case.

41:37.284 --> 41:39.967
When's the last time
you saw Shane Hendricks?

41:41.828 --> 41:43.388
The day before my father died.

41:45.507 --> 41:47.896
We raced boats right outside.

41:48.835 --> 41:50.842
Does he have
something to do with this?

41:51.010 --> 41:53.498
- I don't know, maybe.
- Did you talk to him?

41:53.667 --> 41:57.244
Yeah, he wasn't very cooperative.

41:58.466 --> 41:59.414
He hates cops.

41:59.585 --> 42:01.276
You know I kind of got that.

42:01.442 --> 42:02.783
You and he are friends, huh?

42:04.225 --> 42:06.135
He liked to come around
and piss off my dad.

42:06.304 --> 42:10.875
And yet, you chose to hang out
with him anyway, right?

42:11.744 --> 42:14.427
We were friends since we were kids.
We know the same people.

42:16.032 --> 42:18.748
Look, maybe I wanted
to piss off my dad too.

42:18.911 --> 42:21.016
Was Shane sleeping
with Brandi Cox?

42:23.007 --> 42:26.716
How should I know?
I never met her before the other day.

42:27.358 --> 42:29.660
Oh, right. Right.

42:30.718 --> 42:31.994
She involved with this too?

42:33.437 --> 42:36.186
Damned if I know. Too early to tell.

42:36.349 --> 42:37.756
I wouldn't rule her out though.

42:37.917 --> 42:41.811
In fact, I wouldn't rule anyone out.

42:42.621 --> 42:46.232
You're probably anxious to get back
with your wife. Thanks for your time.

42:47.356 --> 42:50.203
Oh, and you rest assured,
young man...

42:50.363 --> 42:52.981
...I will find your father's killer.

42:58.714 --> 43:00.121
He knows.

43:00.282 --> 43:01.908
He doesn't know anything.

43:02.074 --> 43:03.416
Did you tell him what we said?

43:03.578 --> 43:05.487
Yeah, that Shane hated my dad,
I told him.

43:05.658 --> 43:07.959
Then he asked about Brandi,
said she was a suspect.

43:08.121 --> 43:09.169
A suspect?

43:09.337 --> 43:11.508
- Yeah, might be a suspect.
- "Was" or "might be?"

43:11.673 --> 43:13.778
I don't know.
What difference does it make?

43:13.945 --> 43:14.927
He's on to her.

43:15.097 --> 43:18.413
Carson, we knew
he was gonna suspect Brandi.

43:18.936 --> 43:21.238
I'm pretty sure
that Brandi won't talk.

43:21.400 --> 43:24.214
Pretty sure? Jesus, Rach.
You said she was 100 percent.

43:24.375 --> 43:27.571
I know, I thought so.
But now I don't know.

43:27.735 --> 43:30.418
I didn't wanna tell you, before
the wedding she came to me...

43:30.582 --> 43:33.332
...and she just started talking
a I this crazy stuff...

43:33.495 --> 43:35.731
...about how she wasn't happy
with our arrangement.

43:44.533 --> 43:47.085
- She threaten you?
- This is why I didn't wanna tell you.

43:47.252 --> 43:48.626
I knew you'd get al worked up.

43:48.789 --> 43:51.505
- Rach, did she threaten you?
- Sort of.

43:55.508 --> 43:57.809
We gotta take care of her
before Walker to gets her.

43:59.891 --> 44:01.167
I'll set it up.

44:01.746 --> 44:03.175
Where?

44:05.458 --> 44:08.687
Tonight at the hotel
by the Glades.

44:13.810 --> 44:16.013
It's okay, we can do this.

44:26.096 --> 44:28.200
I'm worried about Walker.

44:29.071 --> 44:30.413
Hey, cap, you got a minute?

44:31.375 --> 44:35.466
Yeah. Larry, Larry, you know I can't
comment on an ongoing investigation.

44:38.286 --> 44:40.196
All right, yup, always a pleasure.

44:41.550 --> 44:43.688
Why the hell isn't that Ted Wheetly
case closed?

44:43.854 --> 44:46.374
Well, I was waiting for Forensics
to give me a report...

44:46.542 --> 44:48.516
...on that piece I found at the scene.

44:49.005 --> 44:51.176
- And?
- It's an intake manifold valve...

44:51.341 --> 44:53.926
...from a 1998 V10.
- So?

44:54.092 --> 44:56.678
So Ted would never let anything
in his car that wasn't new.

44:56.844 --> 44:59.844
This part in particular was recalled.
When the car hit 5000 rpm...

45:00.012 --> 45:02.761
...there was a good chance
that it would spark up and explode.

45:02.923 --> 45:05.290
Maybe we should all
get out of Dodge, you know?

45:05.451 --> 45:07.654
Wait for the money to land.
Let things cool down.

45:07.819 --> 45:10.601
I don't think Carson wants you
to get a penny of his money.

45:10.762 --> 45:13.151
- The check's being sent to me.
- I think he's scheming.

45:13.770 --> 45:16.836
It's his birthright. He doesn't
want a couple of silly swamp girls...

45:17.002 --> 45:18.595
...to get their hands on it.

45:18.762 --> 45:20.616
Okay, any suspects?

45:21.161 --> 45:23.714
- Shane Hendricks.
- You're not serious.

45:23.881 --> 45:26.183
- I am serious.
- Do you know who his father is?

45:26.345 --> 45:28.614
Yes, the new ninth richest man
in Miami.

45:28.777 --> 45:31.559
When the money drops,
you and me will bolt town.

45:31.720 --> 45:33.629
We' cut our losses.
It's still $5 million.

45:33.800 --> 45:37.094
- It's plenty to get by on.
- I don't wanna just get by.

45:37.928 --> 45:39.870
We did this so we wouldn't have to.

45:40.039 --> 45:41.152
So what are you thinking?

45:42.982 --> 45:44.673
It's like you said.

45:45.062 --> 45:49.796
With Carson out of the way...
I mean, I'm the sole heir to his trust.

45:50.821 --> 45:52.196
I don't know about this, Rachel.

45:54.821 --> 45:57.242
Brandi, it's a little ate now
to be getting cold feet.

45:57.413 --> 45:58.362
Don't you think?

45:58.533 --> 46:01.086
- And you want me to bring him n?
- No, I didn't say that.

46:01.253 --> 46:04.481
I said he was a suspect. And no,
I do not want to bring him in yet.

46:04.644 --> 46:07.491
Not until I find out what's really
going on with Brandi Cox.

46:07.652 --> 46:09.953
The girl who got raped?
How is she involved?

46:10.115 --> 46:13.311
Something about her working for
Shane does not sit right with me.

46:14.083 --> 46:15.490
I need your help.

46:17.090 --> 46:19.872
Without it, we get nothing.

46:21.250 --> 46:22.198
When?

46:22.882 --> 46:27.038
We're meeting later tonight
at the hotel by the Glades.

46:33.217 --> 46:35.518
It's okay. We can do this.

46:36.992 --> 46:40.340
This is Blue Bay, not Miami. No se
complaints and the occasional drunk...

46:40.512 --> 46:42.683
...that's about all the excitement
we can handle.

46:42.848 --> 46:44.986
I won't have a homicide
cluttering up my backyard.

46:45.151 --> 46:48.020
- Now close it quick.
- I'm trying to do that, captain.

46:48.191 --> 46:52.795
Which is why I thought maybe I'd go
down to the Keys, poke around a bit.

46:52.958 --> 46:54.900
If you pay for my gas?

47:10.108 --> 47:12.977
Here, why don't you let me
help you with that?

47:13.148 --> 47:16.759
That's sweet. Hey, aren't you
Adam Klotsen's cousin?

47:16.923 --> 47:20.185
- I think I've seen you before.
- No. No. I'm...

47:20.347 --> 47:22.201
I'm looking for Darlene Cox.

47:22.362 --> 47:25.144
- You a cop?
- Yeah. Up at Blue Bay.

47:25.306 --> 47:28.339
- What do you want with Darlene?
- It's about her daughter Brand.

47:28.986 --> 47:31.320
I'm Darlene. What did she do?

47:31.865 --> 47:33.294
Nothing.

47:34.201 --> 47:35.957
I'm part of the rape investigation.

47:37.945 --> 47:39.374
She'd been raped?

47:39.545 --> 47:41.454
When's the last time
you spoke to her?

47:42.072 --> 47:43.981
Not since she and Rachel
left for school.

47:44.152 --> 47:46.421
I just knew something bad
would happen.

47:46.584 --> 47:48.624
No, no, she's...

47:49.943 --> 47:52.976
She's gonna be fine. Do you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

47:53.783 --> 47:56.914
- If you think it'll help.
- I think it will. You just said that...

47:58.582 --> 48:00.589
...she and Rachel
went to school together?

48:00.758 --> 48:03.027
Of course they did.
They was always together.

48:03.190 --> 48:07.051
It was like the two of them grew
from the same branch or something.

48:07.221 --> 48:10.963
I'm a little confused.
Well, I thought that you...

48:11.637 --> 48:14.255
I thought you used to clean
Rachel's estate.

48:15.604 --> 48:18.702
Estate? You mean
that old trailer up on bricks?

48:18.868 --> 48:21.999
Hell. the only thing that would
clean that is a great big hurricane...

48:22.164 --> 48:23.789
...f you know what I mean.

48:23.955 --> 48:26.060
Yeah. know what you...
So you're telling me...

48:26.227 --> 48:28.169
...that Rachel and Brandi
were best friends.

48:28.979 --> 48:30.321
Ever since they were girls.

48:30.483 --> 48:32.654
They'd go up in that cabin
all day in the woods.

48:32.819 --> 48:36.615
- Doing what?
- Just being kids, I guess.

48:36.786 --> 48:39.535
Brandi had a couple of old junkers
she was working on up there.

48:40.498 --> 48:44.010
Thing is, Rachel filled that girl's head
with all sorts of things.

48:44.177 --> 48:46.184
- What kind of things?
- Like the two of them...

48:46.353 --> 48:48.971
...they was gonna go find themselves
some rich husbands.

48:50.257 --> 48:52.493
I don't know where
they came up with that idea.

48:52.656 --> 48:54.030
And now look what happened.

48:54.672 --> 48:58.054
Yeah. One more question.

48:58.223 --> 49:00.645
Where's this old cabin
in the woods?

51:10.400 --> 51:14.360
Anderson. Frank Walker. I need you
to run a part number for me, all right?

51:15.102 --> 51:16.411
Yeah.

51:16.574 --> 51:20.797
I got a feeling it's gonna come up
as a '98 V10.

51:40.796 --> 51:43.185
Stick to the plan, you' I be fine.

51:53.914 --> 51:55.256
Damn.

52:03.833 --> 52:05.905
I ain't seen you in a while.

52:47.572 --> 52:49.230
Squeeze it.

52:59.954 --> 53:00.936
Do it!

53:04.434 --> 53:05.578
Rach, now!

53:07.506 --> 53:09.033
Do it!

53:09.201 --> 53:10.794
Do you think she's gonna kill me?

53:12.721 --> 53:14.029
Rach, now.

53:37.326 --> 53:38.667
You backstabbing bitch!

54:06.378 --> 54:07.655
I am glad did it.

54:09.418 --> 54:11.141
You have blood all over your shirt.

54:11.306 --> 54:13.510
Here. take it off. I'll burn it.

54:14.538 --> 54:17.505
- Did you bring Carson's laptop?
- Yeah. It's in the duffle bag.

54:25.032 --> 54:27.007
Okay. How does this sound?

54:28.039 --> 54:32.894
"I, Carson Wheetly, admit
to killing my father, Ted Wheetly."

54:33.063 --> 54:34.525
Go on.

54:34.695 --> 54:38.143
"He killed my mother.
He was a womanizer...

54:38.310 --> 54:41.376
...a drunk, and a violent man."

54:41.542 --> 54:47.324
"He got what he deserved, just like
this bullet will deliver what I deserve."

54:48.134 --> 54:51.711
No sign of a struggle.
No other prints.

54:51.877 --> 54:54.528
A note. Hell, my 2-year-o d
could've closed this one.

54:54.693 --> 54:55.936
So that's it?

54:56.100 --> 54:58.751
Crazy rich kid kills his father...

54:58.916 --> 55:01.850
...can't stand himself, so he comes
down here and shoots himself?

55:02.020 --> 55:03.165
- That's it?
- Open and shut.

55:04.771 --> 55:08.894
Yeah. Well, why did he drive
all the way down to the swamp?

55:09.059 --> 55:11.645
Why didn't he just
shoot himself at home?

55:11.811 --> 55:14.974
Detective, I invited you down here
as a courtesy...

55:15.138 --> 55:18.105
...because, well, this is your boy.

55:18.274 --> 55:21.088
But as far as the Everglades City P.D.
is concerned...

55:21.249 --> 55:23.966
...it’s stone crab time.

55:24.129 --> 55:27.292
- Did you notify the next of kin?
- She identified the body this morning.

55:55.486 --> 55:56.663
There you are, sir.

55:56.829 --> 55:58.203
Can I help you, detective?

55:58.365 --> 56:00.372
I'm sorry for your loss.

56:00.893 --> 56:04.057
I didn't know condolence calls
were part of the job.

56:06.012 --> 56:08.597
Must be one of the benefits
of being the ninth richest person...

56:08.764 --> 56:10.771
...n the State of Florida.

56:16.379 --> 56:20.023
This whole thing worked out
kind of nice for you.

56:20.826 --> 56:22.997
How all this worked out. isn't it?

56:27.962 --> 56:30.514
By nice you mean
losing my husband?

56:30.681 --> 56:31.630
No, no, no.

56:31.801 --> 56:35.117
By nice I mean by you finally
nabbing yourself a rich boy...

56:35.289 --> 56:36.750
...and all of his riches.

56:37.721 --> 56:39.630
So where'd you get that?

56:39.800 --> 56:42.287
The old cabin by your house.

56:42.456 --> 56:45.871
The cabin where you and Brandi Cox
plotted to find you a husband.

56:46.039 --> 56:48.756
- So what?
- Motive.

56:49.559 --> 56:52.690
That doesn't prove anything,
detective. Except that I'm poor...

56:52.855 --> 56:56.684
...and that I pretended not to be
because I was embarrassed by it.

56:56.854 --> 56:59.701
I just wanted to find myself
a good guy.

57:01.077 --> 57:02.157
That a crime?

57:02.326 --> 57:04.497
No, it's not a crime.

57:04.661 --> 57:09.330
And actually, coming from anyone
but you, it might be touching.

57:12.885 --> 57:15.601
You enjoy your trip
down memory lane.

57:15.764 --> 57:17.324
I'll see myself out.

57:50.735 --> 57:52.590
- Hello?
- Walker came by to visit.

57:52.751 --> 57:54.442
He had the file on Cason.

57:54.607 --> 57:55.622
How?

57:55.791 --> 57:57.547
- He was in the cabin.
- What?

57:57.711 --> 57:59.303
You left that there? Are you crazy?

57:59.470 --> 58:02.819
- We're gonna get caught.
- It's just a file. Doesn't prove anything.

58:02.990 --> 58:04.583
We have to stick to the plan.

58:04.750 --> 58:07.467
I don't like this, Rach. I'm scared.

58:07.630 --> 58:09.669
I told you about Walker
so you'd be prepared...

58:09.837 --> 58:12.739
...n case he came by to see you.
- I'm not sure I can do this.

58:12.909 --> 58:15.843
- I wanna meet, okay? I need to.
- We can't. It's too risky.

58:16.013 --> 58:18.020
I need to see you.
I'm not fucking around.

58:18.188 --> 58:19.465
Okay, okay.

58:19.628 --> 58:21.864
- Calm down. Where?
- The cabin.

58:22.028 --> 58:24.548
Are you crazy? He's been there.

58:24.716 --> 58:27.618
I know. We can make sure there's
nothing we need to get rid of.

58:30.955 --> 58:33.321
- All right.
- One hour.

59:05.958 --> 59:07.136
Hey.

59:10.599 --> 59:12.508
I can't believe
we used to hang out here.

59:12.677 --> 59:14.335
Remember what else
we used to do?

59:14.886 --> 59:16.674
Brandi, this isn't funny.

59:16.837 --> 59:19.259
Listen, if we keep up this shit
we're gonna get caught.

59:19.429 --> 59:21.055
Sit down.

59:21.924 --> 59:23.353
Sit down.

59:29.347 --> 59:31.452
How long since
we've been here together?

59:31.619 --> 59:34.586
I don't know. A couple of years.
Look, I need to know that you're...

59:34.755 --> 59:38.137
You taught me
so many things, remember?

59:39.139 --> 59:43.448
I do. Listen, I need to know
you're not gonna crack.

59:43.778 --> 59:47.771
I'm okay, now that I see you.

59:52.577 --> 59:54.301
Can't I move into your house?

59:56.576 --> 59:58.648
How do we explain that?

59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.214
We'll figure it out.

01:00:06.303 --> 01:00:09.303
You're not gonna let up
until I give in, are you?

01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:13.499
You need to relax.

01:00:26.653 --> 01:00:27.765
Nice try.

01:00:29.053 --> 01:00:32.402
Brandi, what are you doing?

01:00:32.572 --> 01:00:35.703
The same thing you were gonna
do to me. You think I'm stupid.

01:00:36.891 --> 01:00:40.404
I don't know what you're talking about.
Just put the gun down.

01:00:40.987 --> 01:00:42.328
Problem is, I don't trust you.

01:00:42.491 --> 01:00:44.531
You always were
such a se fish bitch.

01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:47.545
No loyalty.

01:00:48.251 --> 01:00:51.414
I've been thinking
and that $5 million is plenty for me.

01:00:51.578 --> 01:00:52.723
Call me simple.

01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:54.319
I'm gonna get all the money.

01:00:54.490 --> 01:00:57.784
So I'll give you everything,
whatever you want.

01:00:57.945 --> 01:00:59.123
I want you dead.

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:01.678
I can't have you blabbing
your mouth to everyone.

01:01:02.329 --> 01:01:03.922
It's too bad.

01:01:04.088 --> 01:01:05.844
You really are a hot piece of ass.

01:01:27.862 --> 01:01:29.585
Rachel.

01:01:30.389 --> 01:01:32.396
Come on out, baby.

01:01:53.907 --> 01:01:55.335
Rachel.

01:01:55.506 --> 01:01:59.564
I don't even care about the money.
I just wanna see your pretty little face.

01:02:59.595 --> 01:03:01.024
No.

01:03:02.954 --> 01:03:04.383
No!

01:03:24.552 --> 01:03:27.269
Detective, a girl walked in,
says she needs to talk to you.

01:03:27.432 --> 01:03:29.187
- Said it's urgent.
- She give you a name?

01:03:29.351 --> 01:03:30.725
Rachel Thomas.

01:03:33.479 --> 01:03:34.755
Really?

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:42.783
I didn't think getting you in here
would be quite this easy.

01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:45.022
Brandi Cox tried to kill me.

01:03:46.373 --> 01:03:47.583
Detective.

01:03:55.108 --> 01:03:56.635
Would you excuse me for a minute?

01:04:07.426 --> 01:04:09.281
Hello, Brandi.

01:04:11.522 --> 01:04:13.594
Have I got a story for you, detective.

01:04:13.762 --> 01:04:15.006
When we were 16...

01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:18.465
...one of Ted Wheetly's companies
came to Glade City...

01:04:18.625 --> 01:04:21.472
...bought up all the commercial
fishing rights.

01:04:21.633 --> 01:04:24.316
Put Brand's father out of bus ness.

01:04:25.025 --> 01:04:26.301
He killed himself.

01:04:27.264 --> 01:04:29.020
Brandi wanted revenge.

01:04:29.184 --> 01:04:32.631
My father had nothing to do with this.
I mean, yeah, he killed himself...

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.774
...but it wasn't just because
of Ted Wheetly.

01:04:34.943 --> 01:04:37.976
Even if I did blame Wheetly,
what was I gonna do about it?

01:04:38.143 --> 01:04:40.182
She thought she looked
too trailer-trash...

01:04:40.350 --> 01:04:45.019
...to nab any rich white guy
or any of his friends.

01:04:45.822 --> 01:04:47.861
So she wanted me to do it for her.

01:04:48.029 --> 01:04:51.095
I told her straight up
I wasn't gonna help her.

01:04:51.645 --> 01:04:55.671
But I started reading
all this stuff about Carson...

01:04:57.309 --> 01:04:59.545
...and I guess you could say
I fell for him.

01:04:59.708 --> 01:05:01.650
So I came to Blue Bay to find him.

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:04.754
I came to Blue Bay because I knew
I had to get out of the Glades.

01:05:04.924 --> 01:05:06.833
I had a friend here.

01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:09.274
Well, I thought I had a friend here.

01:05:09.435 --> 01:05:12.751
Brandi was always jealous
of my relationship with Carson.

01:05:12.923 --> 01:05:15.737
From the beginning,
she wanted to kill his father.

01:05:15.899 --> 01:05:17.589
But then...

01:05:19.162 --> 01:05:22.457
...after she found out
that Carson and me were in love...

01:05:23.226 --> 01:05:25.560
...she wanted to kill him, too.

01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:28.142
I thought the whole thing was funny.

01:05:28.665 --> 01:05:31.479
I mean. here's Rachel,
this girl from the trailer park...

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:34.258
...convincing all these rich kids
that she was one of them.

01:05:34.424 --> 01:05:37.009
I was proud of her
until I realized her plan...

01:05:37.176 --> 01:05:39.151
...to kill Ted Wheetly
and take his money.

01:05:39.319 --> 01:05:42.286
She convinced Carson
to kill his father.

01:05:42.999 --> 01:05:46.446
But it was easy
because Carson hated his dad.

01:05:47.094 --> 01:05:49.265
Carson and Rachel
came to me first.

01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:51.569
He blamed his dad
for king his mom.

01:05:51.734 --> 01:05:54.351
- And Carson wanted him dead.
- Not at first.

01:05:54.517 --> 01:05:58.543
But Rachel worked on him.
And in the end he did.

01:05:58.709 --> 01:06:00.945
And when I said no,
I wouldn't do it...

01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:03.956
...that's when they hooked up
with Shane Hendricks to help them.

01:06:04.116 --> 01:06:08.905
I said no, but it didn't matter.

01:06:09.076 --> 01:06:11.083
Rachel got Shane Hendricks
to do it.

01:06:11.252 --> 01:06:13.902
Why, at any time,
didn't you go to the police?

01:06:14.067 --> 01:06:17.296
Detective, I'm just
a poor girl from the swamp.

01:06:17.459 --> 01:06:20.687
I grew up thinking that a I cops
wanted to do was just throw you in jail.

01:06:24.211 --> 01:06:25.487
What the hell is going on?

01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:28.039
I need a bulldozer
to get through a this horseshit.

01:06:28.209 --> 01:06:30.576
- Neither of them is telling the truth.
- They both are.

01:06:30.737 --> 01:06:34.599
- And they're both lying their asses off.
- What do you think happened?

01:06:34.769 --> 01:06:37.103
I think that they preyed
on this innocent kid Carson.

01:06:37.264 --> 01:06:40.014
Now he's out of the way,
they're trying to screw each other...

01:06:40.177 --> 01:06:42.282
...out of the money.
That's what I think.

01:06:42.448 --> 01:06:45.001
What about the other kid,
Shane Hendricks?

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:46.662
No, he's a dupe.

01:06:46.832 --> 01:06:49.766
These girls are much too smart
to clue in a joker like that.

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:52.487
What can you prove?

01:06:55.502 --> 01:06:58.219
Nothing. Absolutely nothing,
not yet.

01:06:59.150 --> 01:07:01.964
I have to cut them loose.
We can't hold them without charges.

01:07:02.126 --> 01:07:05.769
- I got confessions.
- Accusations, unsubstantiated ones.

01:07:05.933 --> 01:07:08.780
- One of those girls...
- The ninth richest girl in Florida.

01:07:08.941 --> 01:07:12.486
Yeah, I know. I know, and
she's getting away with murder.

01:07:12.653 --> 01:07:16.482
All right. Anybody know we got the
ninth richest girl in Miami in custody?

01:07:18.827 --> 01:07:21.478
- A right, Brandi.
- I have proof.

01:07:21.644 --> 01:07:24.294
All this happened so fast
that Rachel didn't get a chance...

01:07:24.459 --> 01:07:26.215
...to feed the evidence to the gators.

01:07:26.699 --> 01:07:28.041
And you know where it is.

01:07:28.523 --> 01:07:32.679
She made me promise not to tell,
but I have to do the right thing.

01:07:33.322 --> 01:07:35.078
You really expect me
to believe that?

01:07:35.242 --> 01:07:37.478
I'm telling you the evidence is there.

01:07:38.345 --> 01:07:41.956
Everything you need to close
the case and be the hero.

01:07:43.688 --> 01:07:44.637
Where?

01:07:45.928 --> 01:07:47.390
The cabin.

01:08:13.733 --> 01:08:17.310
In that cabinet Is a blue gym bag.

01:08:19.237 --> 01:08:22.749
Inside Is a hard drive with the security
disks from Shane's garage...

01:08:22.916 --> 01:08:24.509
...the night of Ted's murder.

01:08:24.676 --> 01:08:26.268
They show Carson and Rachel...

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:28.508
...breaking in and rigging the car...

01:08:28.675 --> 01:08:32.799
...installing a jacked-up
part from some V10 engine.

01:08:37.090 --> 01:08:39.390
Rachel's shirt is In the bag, too.

01:08:41.474 --> 01:08:43.067
And you know what?

01:08:43.234 --> 01:08:45.786
It's covered in Carson's blood.

01:08:45.953 --> 01:08:48.319
You can find her wearing it
in pictures at the house.

01:08:48.929 --> 01:08:52.027
You better have ironclad proof
or I' I sue this whole city.

01:08:52.192 --> 01:08:54.526
Brandi told us all
about the blue gym bag.

01:08:54.688 --> 01:08:56.792
- What blue gym bag?
- The one down at the cabin.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:59.162
The one that has
all the security tapes...

01:08:59.327 --> 01:09:02.197
...and all the bloody clothes in it.
That gym bag.

01:09:02.367 --> 01:09:04.024
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:09:04.191 --> 01:09:07.224
It really doesn't matter, because
your face is all over the tapes...

01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:09.430
...and Carson's blood
s all over your shirt.

01:09:09.598 --> 01:09:11.224
That bitch set me up.

01:09:35.675 --> 01:09:37.747
All right, listen up.
As some of you might...

01:09:37.915 --> 01:09:42.256
...already know. today is Frank's
last day on the force.

01:09:42.426 --> 01:09:44.630
- A right, great.
- A right.

01:09:44.794 --> 01:09:46.582
Retire while you are
relatively young.

01:09:46.746 --> 01:09:50.095
That is the only advice my old man
gave me that I ever decided to take.

01:09:50.265 --> 01:09:52.437
We, we're all
real proud of you, Frank.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:55.219
You persisted when most of us
would have stopped.

01:09:55.385 --> 01:09:57.938
You solved the biggest homicide
in Blue Bay's history.

01:09:58.105 --> 01:10:00.625
There's no better way to go out
than when you're on top.

01:10:00.793 --> 01:10:02.102
Thank you, Captain.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.978
Frank, turn that up a minute,
will you?

01:10:05.143 --> 01:10:07.053
Now, as per the trust...

01:10:07.223 --> 01:10:09.459
- Sure thing.
...money's passed to Wheetly blood.

01:10:09.623 --> 01:10:12.972
We'll establish the Wheetly Business
School at Blue Bay University.

01:10:13.143 --> 01:10:16.590
...and the Ted Wheetly
Memorial Speedway.

01:10:16.759 --> 01:10:20.174
We will also be making a sizeable
donation to the Cayman Reef Fund.

01:10:20.342 --> 01:10:22.578
Millions of dollars to a bunch of fish.

01:10:22.742 --> 01:10:26.570
- The whole world's gone crazy.
- Too crazy for me.

01:10:26.741 --> 01:10:30.538
So tell me, Frank, what the hell
are you gonna do now anyway?

01:10:58.257 --> 01:10:59.501
Yup.

01:11:00.817 --> 01:11:02.311
Bingo.

01:11:03.153 --> 01:11:05.738
Do you even know
how to drive this thing?

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:08.901
How hard could it be?

01:11:09.072 --> 01:11:11.755
I have a couple of manuals
in my duffel.

01:11:15.023 --> 01:11:17.543
The way I figure it,
we just point this baby southeast...

01:11:17.711 --> 01:11:21.126
...give her a little gas,
eventually we run into an island.

01:11:21.294 --> 01:11:23.661
What do you say
we get the hell out of this town?

01:11:23.822 --> 01:11:25.099
Aye, aye, Captain.

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:11.487
What are you doing back there?

01:12:11.656 --> 01:12:12.605
Re ax, Frank.

01:12:12.776 --> 01:12:14.369
Just wanted to give you a massage.

01:12:15.624 --> 01:12:18.886
Look, I think we need to get something
straight right now, okay?

01:12:19.048 --> 01:12:22.364
I don't trust you, and you sure as hell
shouldn't trust me.

01:12:22.535 --> 01:12:25.884
We're not partners,
we're not even really friends, and...

01:12:26.055 --> 01:12:29.437
...as intriguing as the whole not on is,
I don't think we should have sex.

01:12:29.606 --> 01:12:32.224
What I think we should do
is get our asses to the is and...

01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:34.724
...split the money
and then become nothing...

01:12:34.885 --> 01:12:37.918
...but distant memories to one another.
You're good with that?

01:12:38.725 --> 01:12:42.237
- Okay.
- Good. Now, turn around.

01:12:42.405 --> 01:12:45.504
- What for?
- Call it morbid curiosity.

01:12:46.789 --> 01:12:48.730
All the way.

01:12:52.644 --> 01:12:53.985
Not armed.

01:12:54.147 --> 01:12:57.278
No, but that does not necessarily
mean that you are not dangerous.

01:12:58.051 --> 01:13:00.123
We both know that.

01:13:02.147 --> 01:13:06.041
Okay, no massage,
no making out, no sex.

01:13:06.210 --> 01:13:08.959
What about beer?
Or are you some sort of puritan?

01:13:09.122 --> 01:13:10.169
No, beer is good.

01:13:13.089 --> 01:13:14.714
You know what I can't he p
thinking?

01:13:14.881 --> 01:13:19.615
There's a couple of hundred mil ion
dollars worth of reef sharks right there.

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:26.040
I have a question for you,
young lady.

01:13:26.208 --> 01:13:29.852
How long were you plotting
to kill Ted Wheetly?

01:13:30.015 --> 01:13:32.949
Since that cocksucker
k led my father.

01:13:33.279 --> 01:13:34.970
Just like Rachel said.

01:13:35.678 --> 01:13:38.548
Sometimes that lying bitch
told the truth.

01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:42.867
So Rachel was trying
to cheat you out of it?

01:13:43.645 --> 01:13:45.685
She thought she was so slick.

01:13:47.517 --> 01:13:49.427
Hey, one more question.

01:13:49.597 --> 01:13:51.637
Linda Dobson disappearing.

01:13:51.805 --> 01:13:53.877
I could never figure that out.
What was that?

01:13:54.045 --> 01:13:57.393
No mystery. She needed money
to move to Europe...

01:13:57.564 --> 01:14:01.208
...so this was just
the easiest way to get it.

01:14:01.372 --> 01:14:04.055
It's always the easy answer, isn't it?

01:14:05.883 --> 01:14:07.988
I think we got a live one here!

01:14:08.154 --> 01:14:09.583
Yeah.

01:14:11.002 --> 01:14:13.849
We are gonna be eating fish
for dinner tonight.

01:14:14.234 --> 01:14:15.794
We're a whores, aren't we, Frank?

01:14:17.978 --> 01:14:19.800
What are you doing?
Oh, no.

01:14:19.962 --> 01:14:21.587
No. No.

01:14:21.753 --> 01:14:23.346
No, please.

01:14:23.513 --> 01:14:25.879
I'm a greedy bitch.
What did you expect?

01:14:34.935 --> 01:14:38.383
If you see one of those rich sharks,
maybe it'll buy you a clue.

01:14:38.551 --> 01:14:40.144
Asshole!

01:15:40.368 --> 01:15:41.960
All right, easy, tiger.

01:15:42.127 --> 01:15:43.174
Money landed?

01:15:43.343 --> 01:15:45.350
Yeah, about five minutes ago
it became final.

01:15:45.519 --> 01:15:48.715
Wheetly Enterprises is dissolved,
all of its assets been dispersed.

01:15:48.879 --> 01:15:52.140
One of the larger recipients
was the Cayman Reef Trust...

01:15:52.302 --> 01:15:56.939
...to be administered without oversight
by its pres dent, yours truly...

01:15:57.102 --> 01:15:59.589
...and his soon-to-be
smoking-hot wife.

01:15:59.757 --> 01:16:01.545
So we're free to grow old...

01:16:01.709 --> 01:16:04.262
...fat, and happy?
- Oh, I don't know about that.

01:16:04.429 --> 01:16:07.112
I have to keep you away from
the lobster buffet, Mrs. Stuben.

01:16:08.781 --> 01:16:10.853
Can't believe it's over,
after al the planning.

01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:12.929
It's, like, finally done.

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:16.065
Is "dead" done enough for you?

01:16:18.059 --> 01:16:21.572
- It' I stick?
- Whatever Walker got was good.

01:16:21.739 --> 01:16:23.626
I'll take that.

01:16:23.787 --> 01:16:25.696
Jump on. I'll give you a ride home.

01:16:25.866 --> 01:16:28.254
Oh, sweetheart, you know
how wobbly my sea legs are.

01:16:28.426 --> 01:16:31.655
Come on, baby. I want you to jump on
and drop your anchor on me.

01:16:33.001 --> 01:16:34.463
Last one home, slave for a day?

01:16:34.633 --> 01:16:37.666
- I might just let you win.
- I hope you do.

01:16:57.702 --> 01:17:00.604
Watch out for that
manifold intake valve.

01:17:05.381 --> 01:17:06.908
We did it.

01:17:28.835 --> 01:17:30.361
You Brandi?

01:17:31.650 --> 01:17:34.497
- Who are you?
- I want to talk about your father.

01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:37.722
- He's dead.
- I know.

01:17:37.890 --> 01:17:41.053
Your father was a good man.
He didn't deserve to die.

01:17:43.105 --> 01:17:45.244
I'm the guy who's gonna
help you get even.

01:17:46.144 --> 01:17:47.289
All right.

01:17:48.097 --> 01:17:49.558
How?

01:17:59.583 --> 01:18:01.557
He's just perfect, right?

01:18:14.749 --> 01:18:18.578
I just can't believe how bad y
your father treated your mother.

01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:24.442
She must have felt
there was no other way out.

01:18:25.724 --> 01:18:27.578
He's a murderer...

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:30.161
...and nobody is gonna
see it like that.

01:18:31.643 --> 01:18:34.676
He'll get what's coming to him.
They always do.

01:18:35.483 --> 01:18:37.076
Bullshit.

01:18:37.690 --> 01:18:39.894
Guy walks on water.

01:18:44.122 --> 01:18:45.780
You know...

01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:49.390
...there is something
you can do about it.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.851
Like what?

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:04.886
Breaking into Shane's garage
is a piece of cake.

01:19:05.047 --> 01:19:07.414
There's no security, no nothing.

01:19:07.575 --> 01:19:09.517
- There's no security.
- None.

01:19:09.687 --> 01:19:11.956
All you need to do is get his keys...

01:19:12.119 --> 01:19:13.874
...and et yourself n
through the door.

01:19:14.038 --> 01:19:15.532
How do we get his keys?

01:19:15.702 --> 01:19:17.611
The guy's a total horn dog.

01:19:17.781 --> 01:19:19.756
It shouldn't be too hard.

01:19:27.156 --> 01:19:28.880
No... Hey, Hendricks!

01:19:29.556 --> 01:19:31.694
What the hell are you doing
in my home?

01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:33.354
Carson invited me.

01:19:33.524 --> 01:19:35.050
Rachel.

01:19:36.051 --> 01:19:38.255
You know that whole boat race
was my idea.

01:19:38.419 --> 01:19:39.761
It doesn't matter.

01:19:39.923 --> 01:19:41.678
He's an idiot.

01:19:42.738 --> 01:19:44.843
He's not that bad.

01:19:46.482 --> 01:19:48.107
It's just...

01:19:52.497 --> 01:19:55.148
He gets to have all the fun.

01:19:55.313 --> 01:19:57.223
You're mad at him.

01:19:58.929 --> 01:20:00.423
Yeah?

01:20:00.592 --> 01:20:02.185
So what?

01:20:16.558 --> 01:20:18.598
He gets nothing
unless he gets married.

01:20:18.766 --> 01:20:20.806
He has no interest in that.

01:20:20.974 --> 01:20:22.829
What are we supposed to do,
wait 10 years?

01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:24.899
Oh, yeah, right.
Like that will help.

01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:26.247
He'll totally cut us out.

01:20:26.413 --> 01:20:30.122
Well, then we need to convince him
it's in his best interest to get married.

01:20:31.085 --> 01:20:33.289
Like if he needed to pay me off.

01:20:34.765 --> 01:20:37.764
Like if he didn't, he'd go to jail.

01:20:38.316 --> 01:20:40.836
All right, how?

01:20:41.324 --> 01:20:43.146
I could say he raped me.

01:20:44.715 --> 01:20:45.828
You guys set me up?

01:20:45.995 --> 01:20:47.555
Baby, just re ax.

01:20:48.555 --> 01:20:50.343
Listen, you're not thinking straight.

01:20:50.506 --> 01:20:52.710
If we don't get married,
we don't get a penny.

01:20:52.874 --> 01:20:56.070
I mean this way, we get
some of the trust every year...

01:20:56.234 --> 01:21:00.740
...plus we get a big payout
up front that we can all split.

01:21:00.905 --> 01:21:04.036
- I mean, that's a win-win.
- For you. I'm in jail.

01:21:04.201 --> 01:21:05.542
You can get out real easy.

01:21:06.633 --> 01:21:08.542
By agreeing to get married.

01:21:08.713 --> 01:21:09.857
If you don't...

01:21:10.024 --> 01:21:13.155
...I’m really afraid that Brandi's
gonna go through with those charges.

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:16.254
She thinks you're gonna
cut her out when you're 30.

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.712
What about your friend, Linda?

01:21:19.879 --> 01:21:23.773
- Did you tell her about Dad?
- No, I didn't tell her a thing.

01:21:23.942 --> 01:21:27.520
As far as she's concerned
it was a scam to get the estate.

01:21:29.062 --> 01:21:32.891
She just needed cash for,
I don't know, her year abroad.

01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:40.417
George, where have you been?

01:21:40.581 --> 01:21:42.239
I got here as soon as I could.

01:21:58.978 --> 01:22:00.888
- I'm a little worried.
- About what?

01:22:01.058 --> 01:22:03.065
What if Walker suspects me
for killing Rachel?

01:22:03.234 --> 01:22:06.169
We've been through this. You shoot
her, you feed her to the gators.

01:22:06.337 --> 01:22:09.599
Plant the bag in her house
and tip off the police. I know, baby.

01:22:09.761 --> 01:22:11.287
But what if Walker doesn't buy it?

01:22:11.457 --> 01:22:14.424
He seems smarter
than I imagined him to be.

01:22:16.032 --> 01:22:17.461
Then we buy him.

01:22:17.632 --> 01:22:21.342
I have known Frank for a while now.
He's as crooked as they come.

01:22:34.174 --> 01:22:37.469
Pretty convenient how these
just happened to be there.

01:22:37.630 --> 01:22:38.742
She's a bad crook.

01:22:38.909 --> 01:22:40.502
Well, you're worse.

01:22:40.670 --> 01:22:43.768
Guy lives next to the cabin, nice
old trucker, invited me for a beer.

01:22:43.933 --> 01:22:46.932
He tells me he saw you
this morning carrying that bag.

01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:50.645
He remembers you very well because
he almost ran you over one day.

01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:56.856
Memory fits you to a tee,
your comp ex on, your height.

01:22:57.436 --> 01:22:59.770
His memory is bulletproof.

01:23:02.779 --> 01:23:06.127
How would you like
an early retirement, detective?

01:23:27.288 --> 01:23:28.400
We did it.

01:23:37.462 --> 01:23:39.120
How about you buy me a drink?

01:23:39.286 --> 01:23:41.806
How about buy you
the whole damn bar?

01:23:41.806 --> 01:23:46.601
