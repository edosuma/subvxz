(walkers snarling )

02:56.469 --> 02:59.586
(snarling )

03:52.358 --> 03:54.394
(theme music playing )

04:42.199 --> 04:44.451
Carl, slow down.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.654
Carl, stop!

04:50.833 --> 04:53.290
We need to stay
together.

04:53.461 --> 04:57.670
We got to find a place
with food, supplies.

05:01.719 --> 05:03.084
Hey.

05:03.262 --> 05:05.423
We're gonna be...

05:29.288 --> 05:32.121
( crows cawing )

05:45.471 --> 05:47.837
Wait outside, okay?

05:48.015 --> 05:50.097
- Keep watch.
- You keep watch.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.768
You can barely stand.

05:51.936 --> 05:53.892
I'm not gonna let you
go in there alone.

05:54.063 --> 05:57.271
- Excuse me?
- We've done this before.

05:57.441 --> 05:59.272
I'm gonna help
you clear it.

05:59.443 --> 06:02.480
You should just
let me do it myself.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.323
Let's go.

06:27.263 --> 06:29.345
Kitchen's clear.

06:37.398 --> 06:39.730
(snarling )

06:52.871 --> 06:55.203
That might be
all that's left.

07:01.463 --> 07:02.839
- I can get it from here.
- No.

07:03.007 --> 07:05.214
No, it's weak.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.125
l'll draw it out.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.846
Stay back.

07:24.737 --> 07:26.193
Damn it.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.939
- Don't.
- ( gunshot)

07:31.368 --> 07:32.699
I said not to.

07:32.870 --> 07:34.155
You couldn't do it
with the ax.

07:34.330 --> 07:36.742
I had it.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.167
Every bullet counts.

07:39.335 --> 07:41.041
We'd have needed
that one later.

07:41.211 --> 07:44.749
See what you can find.
Then let's move on.

07:56.185 --> 07:59.348
Kitchen wasn't empty
after all.

07:59.521 --> 08:03.105
My haul.
You?

08:07.112 --> 08:09.068
lwin.

09:00.332 --> 09:01.833
Hey.

09:04.503 --> 09:05.993
Hey.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.340
Hey.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.008
That one's as good as any.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.465
Quick and quiet.

09:50.632 --> 09:53.248
We need to clear it
before sundown.

10:26.168 --> 10:27.783
Carl.

10:35.427 --> 10:37.588
- Carl.
- I got it.

10:37.763 --> 10:40.220
All the doors
down here are open.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.051
Just stop!

10:48.148 --> 10:50.389
-( pounds wall)
- Hey, asshole!

10:50.567 --> 10:52.103
Hey, shitface!

10:52.277 --> 10:54.654
- Hey--
- Watch your mouth!

10:54.822 --> 10:57.108
Are you kidding me?

10:57.282 --> 10:59.113
If there's one of them
down there,

10:59.284 --> 11:00.945
they would have come out.

11:24.101 --> 11:25.466
(coughs)

12:37.215 --> 12:39.547
( chuckles )

13:00.197 --> 13:02.404
Rick:
Find anything?

13:05.118 --> 13:07.370
Check the back door?

13:26.306 --> 13:27.921
(grunts)

13:28.100 --> 13:29.806
l tied the door shut.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.468
We don't need to take
any chances.

13:32.646 --> 13:33.761
You don't think
it'll hold?

13:33.939 --> 13:36.100
- Carl.
- It's a strong knot.

13:36.274 --> 13:39.892
Clove hitch.
Shane taught me.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.935
Remember him?

13:43.532 --> 13:45.614
Yeah, I remember him.

13:45.784 --> 13:47.445
I remember him
every day.

13:48.954 --> 13:51.536
There something else
you want to say to me?

14:10.308 --> 14:13.300
( wheezing )

14:18.859 --> 14:20.895
This'll have to do
for the night.

14:33.457 --> 14:35.948
You gonna have some?

14:36.126 --> 14:37.241
You should eat.

14:37.419 --> 14:39.250
We should save it.

15:07.991 --> 15:08.980
Hey.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.990
I don't want any.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.947
Eat it.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.328
Now.
( wheezing )

15:29.554 --> 15:32.296
(wheezing continues )

15:47.823 --> 15:50.155
Listen, I'm just
being honest.

15:50.325 --> 15:54.238
I thought it was a bit...
pedestrian.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.903
-( laughs ) Pedestrian?
- As in lame.

15:57.082 --> 15:59.243
- And played.
- Played?

15:59.417 --> 16:01.544
Where have you seen
anything like it before? Tell me that.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.497
I've never seen a gorilla
drive a car before,

16:03.672 --> 16:06.334
but if you put it in a museum,
I'm not gonna call it art.

16:06.508 --> 16:08.214
(jazz music playing )

16:08.385 --> 16:11.752
Mike, would you please
talk some sense into your lover?

16:11.930 --> 16:14.091
Oh, my God.
You did notjust call me that.

16:14.266 --> 16:16.928
- Mm-hmm.
- I agree with my lover.

16:17.102 --> 16:19.434
- I mean, the whole thing was--
- Very lame.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.469
- And very played.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.184
No, no, don't do that.
Don't do that.

16:23.358 --> 16:25.690
Don't start finishing
each other's sentences, man.

16:25.861 --> 16:27.101
It's just gross.

16:27.279 --> 16:30.442
l was going to say that the whole thing
was like a monument

16:30.615 --> 16:32.776
to someone trying too damned
hard to be different.

16:32.951 --> 16:35.067
Hallelujah.

16:35.245 --> 16:38.783
Listen,
I'm glad I saw it

16:38.957 --> 16:41.448
even though
I did not love it.

16:46.965 --> 16:49.206
- ( giggling )
- Hope we're not boring you, peanut.

16:49.384 --> 16:51.295
Come here.

17:02.898 --> 17:05.605
I don't think that we
should stay at the camp.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.902
No. I'm not taking
my son out there.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.060
I don't know if this place
will work out,

17:10.238 --> 17:12.650
but I know it won't
if we go out there.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.486
Does it even
matter anymore?

17:15.660 --> 17:16.991
Are we just
kidding ourselves?

17:17.162 --> 17:18.777
Okay.

17:18.955 --> 17:21.037
All right, I see
what this is.

17:21.208 --> 17:24.917
Really?
What is this, Michonne?

17:25.086 --> 17:26.917
I mean, you've gotten
good with a sword.

17:27.088 --> 17:28.669
You know how valuable
that is now?

17:28.840 --> 17:31.502
- You know what that makes you?
- For what?

17:31.676 --> 17:35.043
What are we going for?
Where's the happy ending here?

17:35.222 --> 17:37.008
This isn't life.

17:37.182 --> 17:39.218
This isn't anything
close, okay?

17:39.392 --> 17:41.883
Not for me,
not for us.

17:44.272 --> 17:46.684
And for our son.

17:50.904 --> 17:53.020
What's the answer here?

17:53.198 --> 17:55.780
Well, what is
the damn question, Mike?

17:59.204 --> 18:01.365
Why?

18:01.539 --> 18:03.530
Okay.

18:03.708 --> 18:04.823
That's good.

18:05.001 --> 18:07.959
Now l have a question.

18:08.129 --> 18:10.506
Who's gonna open
the wine?

18:14.094 --> 18:16.756
No. No.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.466
No, no, no, no.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.301
No. No!

18:20.475 --> 18:24.309
No!No!No!No!

18:24.479 --> 18:26.595
No!

18:26.773 --> 18:29.936
( gasps, panting )

18:30.110 --> 18:32.351
(walkers snarling )

18:40.495 --> 18:42.360
( groans )

20:57.465 --> 20:58.921
Dad?

21:05.223 --> 21:07.009
Dad?

21:12.230 --> 21:14.391
Dad, wake up.

21:18.903 --> 21:21.235
Wake up.
Come on.

21:42.385 --> 21:45.047
Mom used to do this
to me when l was sick.

21:47.515 --> 21:51.007
( labored breathing )

21:56.691 --> 21:58.397
No.

21:59.611 --> 22:01.943
You have to wake up
right now.

22:02.113 --> 22:04.604
Wake up!
Wake up!

22:04.782 --> 22:07.239
Wake up! Wake up!

22:07.410 --> 22:11.153
- ( thudding at door)
- ( snarling)

22:52.664 --> 22:56.202
- ( snarling)
- ( thudding)

23:13.851 --> 23:15.466
Hey, you!

23:17.647 --> 23:20.263
Fresh meat right here.
Come and get it.

23:25.363 --> 23:27.524
Let's take a walk.

23:27.699 --> 23:29.815
Keep up.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.530
That's it.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.041
Keep coming.

23:41.212 --> 23:43.419
Very good.

23:45.717 --> 23:48.174
Come on, keep coming.

23:49.512 --> 23:51.343
Come on.

23:51.514 --> 23:53.129
Right here,
look at me.

23:53.308 --> 23:55.845
- ( snarling )
- There you go.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.313
Come on.
That's it.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.397
Just a little farther.

24:10.241 --> 24:11.902
That's it.

24:14.829 --> 24:16.490
That's right.

24:17.874 --> 24:19.284
Keep coming.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.541
Just a little farther.

24:26.174 --> 24:28.165
Come on.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.591
- ( snarling)
- Oh, shit.

24:44.567 --> 24:46.523
(grunts)

24:54.327 --> 24:56.613
(gunshot)

24:59.791 --> 25:01.656
(gunshot)

25:04.003 --> 25:06.119
(grunting)

25:08.716 --> 25:10.331
( gunshots)

25:13.638 --> 25:15.378
( exhales )

25:15.556 --> 25:18.389
( panting )

25:19.477 --> 25:21.934
(groaning)

25:45.336 --> 25:47.247
(coughing)

26:06.190 --> 26:07.805
lwin.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.493
Cool.

28:21.576 --> 28:23.862
( sniffles )

28:24.036 --> 28:25.947
I killed three walkers.

28:27.999 --> 28:29.705
They were at the door.

28:29.876 --> 28:32.492
They were gonna get in,

28:32.670 --> 28:35.878
but I lured them away.

28:37.925 --> 28:39.961
I killed them.

28:42.013 --> 28:44.345
I saved you.

28:44.515 --> 28:46.801
I saved you.

28:46.976 --> 28:50.594
I didn't forget while
you had us playing farmer.

28:50.771 --> 28:53.183
I still know
how to survive.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.350
Lucky for us.

29:01.282 --> 29:03.739
I don't need you anymore.

29:06.203 --> 29:08.455
I don't need you
to protect me anymore.

29:08.623 --> 29:10.284
I can take care
of myself.

29:10.458 --> 29:11.743
You probably can't even
protect me anyways.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.829
You couldn't protect Judith.

29:14.003 --> 29:15.539
You couldn't protect...

29:15.713 --> 29:17.499
(sighs)

29:17.673 --> 29:20.130
Hershel or Glenn

29:20.301 --> 29:21.541
or Maggie.

29:21.719 --> 29:24.381
Michonne, Daryl,

29:24.555 --> 29:27.342
or Mom.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.843
You just wanted
to plant vegetables.

29:32.021 --> 29:33.557
You just wanted
to hide.

29:33.731 --> 29:36.564
He knew where we were
and you didn't care!

29:36.734 --> 29:38.520
You just hid
behind those fences

29:38.694 --> 29:40.400
and waited for...

29:40.571 --> 29:41.902
(sighs)

29:42.073 --> 29:43.734
They're all gone now.

29:43.908 --> 29:46.274
Because of you!

29:46.452 --> 29:48.067
They counted on you!

29:48.245 --> 29:50.156
You were their leader!

29:55.920 --> 29:58.332
( sniffles )

29:58.506 --> 30:00.542
But now...

30:02.677 --> 30:04.759
you're nothing.

30:11.769 --> 30:13.384
( sniffles )

30:16.983 --> 30:18.644
(sighs)

30:25.491 --> 30:27.777
I'd be fine
if you died.

31:14.165 --> 31:15.655
(grunts)

31:30.723 --> 31:32.509
(grunts)

31:35.061 --> 31:37.097
Damn it.

33:40.978 --> 33:42.468
( door creaks)

33:42.646 --> 33:44.978
(snarling )

33:57.286 --> 33:58.776

(gunshot)

34:09.173 --> 34:11.334
( clicking )

34:16.472 --> 34:18.303
Oh, shit.

34:23.395 --> 34:24.896
Come on.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.445
Come on.

34:44.083 --> 34:45.198
Come on.

34:45.376 --> 34:46.707
(grunts)

34:58.389 --> 35:00.004
Come on.

35:00.182 --> 35:03.470
(whimpering)

35:14.571 --> 35:17.904
-( pounding)
- ( panting)

36:14.798 --> 36:18.290
(walker snarling )

37:41.969 --> 37:43.550
No!

37:45.264 --> 37:48.222
No. No.

38:10.747 --> 38:13.159
No!No!No!No!

38:13.333 --> 38:16.370
( panting )

38:29.516 --> 38:31.928
(sobbing )

40:05.320 --> 40:08.278
( raspy breathing )

40:08.448 --> 40:10.029
( gasps )

( bowl clatters )

40:32.055 --> 40:33.966
(crying)

40:40.397 --> 40:44.015
(crying continues)

40:49.323 --> 40:51.063
I can't.

40:54.286 --> 40:56.823
l was wrong.

40:59.708 --> 41:01.494
Just do it.

41:01.668 --> 41:05.502
Carl.
( wheezing )

41:10.969 --> 41:13.255
Don't go outside.

41:14.264 --> 41:16.220
Stay safe.

41:35.744 --> 41:37.575
I'm scared.

41:42.542 --> 41:45.033
(crying)

41:46.338 --> 41:48.499
I'm scared.

41:52.511 --> 41:54.502
I'm scared.

42:54.698 --> 42:56.734
Mike.

42:59.244 --> 43:01.075
I miss you.

43:06.877 --> 43:09.163
I missed you even
when l was with you.

43:13.216 --> 43:15.047
Back at the camp.

43:16.386 --> 43:18.547
It wasn't you
who did it.

43:23.727 --> 43:25.467
(sighs)

43:28.106 --> 43:30.518
You were wrong.

43:30.692 --> 43:32.683
Because I'm still here.

43:34.780 --> 43:37.567
And you could be, too.

43:37.741 --> 43:39.732
And he could be.

43:42.746 --> 43:44.737
(sighs)

43:48.919 --> 43:50.910
I know the answer.

43:56.551 --> 43:58.883
I know why.

44:00.764 --> 44:02.720
(sighs)

44:02.891 --> 44:05.598
(snarling )

44:20.784 --> 44:22.945
Rick:
You shouldn't have risked it,

44:23.119 --> 44:25.075
going out there like that.

44:25.247 --> 44:27.579
lt's dangerous.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.991
l was careful.

44:34.297 --> 44:36.788
It's good that
you found more food.

44:39.803 --> 44:41.839
I found even more.

44:42.013 --> 44:44.971
But I ate it.

44:47.269 --> 44:49.180
What was it?

44:51.481 --> 44:54.814
112 ounces of pudding.

44:54.985 --> 44:56.816
( chuckles )

45:01.867 --> 45:03.949
I know...

45:04.119 --> 45:07.703
we'll never get things back
to the way they used to be.

45:09.165 --> 45:10.996
What?

45:12.460 --> 45:15.076
| only clung
to that for you.

45:16.756 --> 45:18.747
ForJudHh.

45:22.053 --> 45:24.715
Now she's gone.

45:29.519 --> 45:31.510
And you...

45:35.483 --> 45:37.474
you're a man, Carl.

45:38.612 --> 45:40.102
You're a man.

45:42.490 --> 45:44.481
I'm sorry.

45:48.246 --> 45:50.237
You don't need to be.

46:39.172 --> 46:43.085
(sobs)

46:59.359 --> 47:00.895
( knocking )

47:08.660 --> 47:10.571
(cocks gun)

47:16.835 --> 47:19.417
( chuckles )

47:20.797 --> 47:22.458
What?

47:23.758 --> 47:25.669
It's for you.

47:31.016 --> 47:33.849
