WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:06.789
<i>-Previously on</i> SEAL Team...
- A SEAL has never

00:06.832 --> 00:07.833
been in enemy captivity before.

00:07.877 --> 00:09.487
You need to talk to someone.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.011
I've checked all those boxes
with the Navy shrinks

00:11.054 --> 00:12.012
and been declared fit
to operate.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.578
Take the shot, Ray!

00:13.622 --> 00:14.623
Pull it together, man.

00:14.666 --> 00:16.755
I have PTS.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.888
When I was in Texas,
we became more than friends.

00:18.931 --> 00:20.020
I'm pregnant.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.586
My replacement Lieutenant Soto.

00:21.630 --> 00:23.806
It's a new day
and a new Bravo, gentlemen.

00:23.849 --> 00:26.722
<i>The doctors did everything
they could-- Full Metal's gone.</i>

00:26.765 --> 00:28.158
All the collateral damage comes
with the job.

00:28.202 --> 00:29.725
The biggest tragedy
would be using it

00:29.768 --> 00:32.206
as an excuse to not fight
for a future with you.

00:32.249 --> 00:33.120
We should get married.

00:33.163 --> 00:34.382
You all right?

00:34.425 --> 00:36.079
It's just a headache.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.602
Probably from the RPG.

00:37.646 --> 00:39.256
I'm good, good.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.824
Enjoy the party.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.444
Time to go.

01:08.677 --> 01:11.854
Bravo is in enemy airspace.

01:13.247 --> 01:14.987
How's their flight path?

01:15.031 --> 01:17.120
They're tracking
to bull's-eye the LZ.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.730
The plan's holding.

01:18.774 --> 01:20.906
It better.

01:20.950 --> 01:24.171
Bravo won't make it home
if it doesn't.

01:37.445 --> 01:39.925
<i>My captors took a drill
and pulverized my leg.</i>

01:40.839 --> 01:43.146
<i>The pain was excruciating.</i>

01:43.190 --> 01:45.496
<i>But I don't feel any now.</i>

01:55.419 --> 01:57.378
Sorry, baby,
I didn't hear you there.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.902
Hope this exposure therapy
isn't just an excuse

01:59.945 --> 02:04.124
to ignore your wife.

02:04.167 --> 02:06.996
Exposure therapy helps make sure
I still have a wife.

02:07.039 --> 02:08.824
Mm.
- Mm?

02:08.867 --> 02:10.956
- Mm.
- It's been nice having you home

02:11.000 --> 02:13.045
for all of training cycle.

02:14.090 --> 02:16.179
I love seeing you back
to your old self.

02:16.223 --> 02:18.094
Still a lot of work to do, baby.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.618
I am healing. I'm not healed.

02:21.619 --> 02:24.448
Are you healed enough
to make it to the grocery store

02:24.492 --> 02:27.582
for party supplies
after your language training?

02:27.625 --> 02:30.759
Who... I'm...
Who throws a housewarming party

02:30.802 --> 02:33.457
more than a year
after they move in?

02:33.501 --> 02:35.851
People who had a year
like we did.

02:36.852 --> 02:39.681
- That part.
- Yes.

02:39.724 --> 02:42.118
You sure you're not using the,
uh, party as an excuse

02:42.162 --> 02:44.686
to prove to Bravo I'm fine?

02:44.729 --> 02:46.992
You know,
the boys haven't seen much of me

02:47.036 --> 02:49.604
since I froze up
on the battlefield.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.214
It can't hurt for your teammates

02:51.258 --> 02:53.912
to see
how well you're doing now.

02:54.913 --> 02:56.306
Right?

02:56.350 --> 02:58.526
- Yeah, you right.
- Am I right?

02:58.569 --> 02:59.831
Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

02:59.875 --> 03:02.704
What do we got here?
We got...

03:02.747 --> 03:06.447
unicorns and rainbows
on a beautiful Texas day.

03:06.490 --> 03:08.579
I tell you what,

03:08.623 --> 03:11.365
you're gonna turn some heads
in either one.

03:11.408 --> 03:13.367
That's right.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.630
Wow, look at you.

03:15.673 --> 03:17.197
You're so beautiful.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.155
Yeah, you could just...

03:19.199 --> 03:22.071
sit on a park bench
and the birds would feed you.

03:22.114 --> 03:24.769
- Somebody's home.

03:24.813 --> 03:26.249
Hey.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.730
Hey. How's my baby girl?

03:28.773 --> 03:31.733
Uh, great. She, uh,
drank her five-ounce bottle,

03:31.776 --> 03:35.345
uh, clocked in 94 minutes
of nap time,

03:35.389 --> 03:38.914
and absolutely crushed
her tummy time. Didn't you?

03:38.957 --> 03:41.264
I see you've rearranged
the bookcase again.

03:41.308 --> 03:44.267
Oh, yeah. I mean, look,
this thing was like an IED.

03:44.311 --> 03:47.009
If Leanne bumped into it, she
was gonna be on the wrong end

03:47.052 --> 03:48.967
of a book avalanche.

03:49.011 --> 03:50.578
I never guessed a man
who enjoys being shot at

03:50.621 --> 03:53.363
would be the world's
most overprotective father.

03:53.407 --> 03:55.017
Uh, speaking of which, um,

03:55.060 --> 03:56.888
I got to get back to the base
for training,

03:56.932 --> 03:59.151
but do you mind if I, uh,
if I come by later

03:59.195 --> 04:01.850
and help with bath
and bedtime routine?

04:01.893 --> 04:03.504
You've been over every night
for three months.

04:03.547 --> 04:05.680
- There's no need to ask.
- I-I know, I just, uh...

04:05.723 --> 04:08.117
Look, I don't want to overstay
my welcome.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.293
No chance. Especially
since you're heading home

04:10.337 --> 04:12.121
- in two weeks.
- Yeah.

04:12.164 --> 04:14.166
Don't remind me.

04:14.210 --> 04:19.128
Okay, hey, I'll see you
later tonight, munchkin, okay?

04:19.171 --> 04:20.564
I'll see you.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.262
<i>Given the challenges</i>

04:22.305 --> 04:25.265
we're facing at home,
how do we modernize our military

04:25.308 --> 04:28.877
without devoting
even more of our GDP to defense?

04:30.922 --> 04:32.794
Lieutenant Davis?

04:32.837 --> 04:34.317
Any ideas?

04:35.362 --> 04:36.885
Diversify.

04:36.928 --> 04:39.148
Put all of our eggs
in one basket,

04:39.191 --> 04:41.846
and we will continue
to have setbacks like the F-35.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.500
It's imperative
that our military branches

04:43.544 --> 04:46.721
aren't spending time and money
on similar R & D

04:46.764 --> 04:48.897
when a variety of perspectives
will triumph

04:48.940 --> 04:51.334
over a homogenous viewpoint.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.510
Impressive answer,
Lieutenant Davis.

04:53.554 --> 04:55.991
Show us pencil pushers
a thing or two.

04:56.034 --> 04:58.123
Madam Undersecretary...

04:58.167 --> 04:59.734
Show-off.
- Shh.

05:09.091 --> 05:10.614
The summer reading list
isn't mandatory, Dad.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.224
It's mandatory
when you're, what,

05:12.268 --> 05:14.401
have a "C" average?
That's mandatory, okay?

05:14.444 --> 05:16.881
You're not evolving.
You're falling behind.

05:16.925 --> 05:18.492
Come on, Mikey Muscles,
let's go.

05:18.535 --> 05:19.884
Mikey led his team in goals

05:19.928 --> 05:21.930
and improved his GPA again
last year.

05:21.973 --> 05:24.280
- He's not falling behind anyone.
- Oh, really?
Okay, how about you?

05:24.324 --> 05:26.369
Let's talk about you-- did you
talk to your Professor Cushman

05:26.413 --> 05:28.980
- about your independent studies?
- Let's stay focused on Mikey.

05:29.024 --> 05:31.853
- Okay, honey. Thank you.
- You got one of those for me,
Uncle Ray?

05:31.896 --> 05:35.987
- Ah, seriously?
- Not unless it's suddenly
next year and you're 21.

05:36.031 --> 05:37.685
- You guys are such buzzkills.
- Aw.

05:37.728 --> 05:39.643
Just keep it moving along.
Nothing to look at here.

05:39.687 --> 05:41.297
You know what?
Keep an eye on her, all right?

05:41.341 --> 05:42.603
Yeah. To you, too.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.648
- This kid.
- Can you believe it?

05:44.692 --> 05:46.868
Yeah. How was, uh,
how was testing?

05:46.911 --> 05:48.913
All the training trips,
I missed that one the most.

05:48.957 --> 05:50.698
Well, not with all
of Bravo together.

05:50.741 --> 05:52.917
It was just
glorified drown-proofing,

05:52.961 --> 05:55.572
- to be honest with you.
- Well, good thing
we'll be reunited soon, yeah?

05:55.616 --> 05:58.401
Yeah. Hey, look, how about you?
You, uh...

05:58.445 --> 06:01.099
sticking with therapy
and doing all the exercises?

06:01.143 --> 06:03.537
How could I not with you texting
me every hour to remind me?

06:03.580 --> 06:06.278
Well, I guess that's me
just showing you how much I...

06:06.322 --> 06:07.584
care about you.

06:07.628 --> 06:10.457
Hey. I'm always here for you.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.806
- You know that.
- That's more clear than ever,
brother.

06:11.849 --> 06:13.503
All right, let's go.

06:13.547 --> 06:15.636
- You got the steaks?
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

06:15.679 --> 06:18.421
So, um, we start off in Rwanda,

06:18.465 --> 06:20.292
and then we move into...

06:20.336 --> 06:21.729
Where was it?

06:21.772 --> 06:23.034
- Tanzania.
- Tanzania, and then we end up

06:23.078 --> 06:24.384
with some beach time
in Zanzibar.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.560
- That is my dream honeymoon.
- Yep.

06:26.603 --> 06:29.127
- Definitely worth the wait.
- And hopefully the money.

06:29.171 --> 06:30.738
You know what?
Government just foot the bill

06:30.781 --> 06:32.653
on your ultimate
summer adventure,

06:32.696 --> 06:34.872
so it's time to focus
on spoiling me, please.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.483
Hey, look, you can't put a price

06:36.526 --> 06:38.398
on all the alone time
we'll have.

06:38.441 --> 06:41.401
Yeah. No Bravo interrupting us
will be a nice change of pace.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.403
Mm-hmm.

06:43.446 --> 06:46.014
I'm not sure how you
kept Ray around for training.

06:47.189 --> 06:48.712
Just... lucky, I guess.

06:48.756 --> 06:51.019
Uh, you mind helping me
with this?

06:51.062 --> 06:52.499
Oh, yeah, of course. Sorry.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.196
Thank you.

06:54.239 --> 06:56.328
Leave that there.

06:57.286 --> 07:00.115
Is it just me, or are
these shoulders getting bigger?

07:00.158 --> 07:02.596
Uh, I have to without you around
to help carry the team.

07:02.639 --> 07:05.860
Yeah, well,
I'll be back soon enough,

07:05.903 --> 07:07.644
give those lats a rest.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.124
I'm, uh, glad to see

07:09.167 --> 07:11.126
things are back on track
with you and Naima.

07:11.169 --> 07:13.345
Like you said, we got to fight
for what we want, right?

07:13.389 --> 07:16.348
How's, uh, how's all
that language training going?

07:16.392 --> 07:19.090
That's why you've been home,
right?

07:19.134 --> 07:21.441
Yoruba's been kicking my ass

07:21.484 --> 07:23.399
with all
its different dialects, man.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.009
But as warrant,

07:25.053 --> 07:28.360
I got to keep adding tools
to my tool kit, right?

07:28.404 --> 07:29.971
That's right.

07:30.014 --> 07:32.016
Bring it in.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.149
So, uh, Mikey thinks
he can make varsity.

07:34.192 --> 07:36.325
- As a freshman?
- Yeah, if I outwork everyone,

07:36.368 --> 07:37.718
age doesn't matter.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.154
Three-foot world.

07:39.197 --> 07:41.548
- Three-foot world.
- Chip off the old block.

07:41.591 --> 07:46.161
Hi, guys. I wanted you to meet
my friend from work, Eva.

07:46.204 --> 07:49.077
- Hi. I'm Brock.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.906
- Eva, this is Jason.
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:51.949 --> 07:56.214
Brock, I think Pepper made
a mess in the front yard.

07:56.258 --> 07:57.607
- Uh, we're on it.
- Yeah.

07:57.651 --> 07:59.217
Uh, come on, Mikey.
You can help, too.

08:00.262 --> 08:02.699
Naima's told me a lot about you.

08:02.743 --> 08:04.788
Well, that's, uh,
that's a little concerning

08:04.832 --> 08:07.095
considering everything
she knows about me.

08:08.270 --> 08:10.315
Eva is from just outside Philly.

08:10.359 --> 08:12.970
I figured you two have a lot
in common.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.319
Oh, Philly. Okay, let's do this.

08:14.363 --> 08:15.930
Let's get Gritty about it,
shall we?

08:18.454 --> 08:19.977
Hi.

08:20.021 --> 08:22.545
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.678
Baby, are you worried that
we're spending too much money

08:24.721 --> 08:26.549
on our honeymoon?

08:26.593 --> 08:30.205
No, not... not after what
we saved on our shotgun wedding.

08:30.248 --> 08:32.207
All right,
for the thousandth time,

08:32.250 --> 08:33.687
we eloped.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.558
- Right?
- Whatever we did,

08:35.602 --> 08:37.952
look, it saved us plenty of
money to pay for the honeymoon.

08:37.995 --> 08:39.519
It's good to know that
our wedding did something

08:39.562 --> 08:41.172
other than give my mother
an excuse to guilt me

08:41.216 --> 08:42.522
- for the rest of our lives.
- Yeah, for that alone,

08:42.565 --> 08:44.175
you deserve to be spoiled.

08:44.219 --> 08:46.700
Oh, such a good husband.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.745
That just sounds weird
when we're three months in.

08:48.789 --> 08:51.400
- Yeah.
- Oh, geez.

08:53.968 --> 08:56.057
Hey, you got some, uh,
some holes in you

08:56.100 --> 08:58.233
- from that ambush.
- Yeah, okay, well, Naima,

08:58.276 --> 09:01.192
- she executed that
to perfection.
Yeah?

09:01.236 --> 09:03.499
Does that mean that we have a...
a double date in our future?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.501
Or is that gonna be difficult
since you guys

09:05.545 --> 09:06.589
are attached at the hip?

09:06.633 --> 09:07.764
What, are you jealous?

09:07.808 --> 09:09.679
- Should be.

09:09.723 --> 09:10.898
Yeah, she is.

09:10.941 --> 09:12.682
We'll always have Zion, right?

09:15.685 --> 09:17.034
You know, I...

09:17.078 --> 09:18.732
my grip slipped
on Angel's Landing,

09:18.775 --> 09:21.299
- practically fell in your lap.
- Yeah, I remember.

09:21.343 --> 09:22.779
I just didn't want
to embarrass you

09:22.823 --> 09:24.259
- in front of your wife.

09:24.302 --> 09:25.695
Oh. Party's over.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.610
Okay, let's roll. Hey!

09:27.654 --> 09:30.787
All right, boys, let's go. Hey.

09:36.053 --> 09:38.795
Any chance you called us in
'cause you missed us,

09:38.839 --> 09:41.015
- Lieutenant Soto?

09:41.058 --> 09:42.625
Apologies for the short notice,

09:42.669 --> 09:44.540
but Bravo's heading
to South Korea

09:44.584 --> 09:47.108
for exercises
with the ROK Special Forces.

09:48.892 --> 09:51.155
Losing our downtime at home
for more training?

09:51.199 --> 09:52.766
Wow, okay, well, I'm not sure

09:52.809 --> 09:56.160
how much we can show ROK
when we don't have a full squad.

09:56.204 --> 09:57.771
Petty Officer Quinn
and Lieutenant Davis

09:57.814 --> 10:00.382
will be on the bird
when we depart at 0900 tomorrow.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.427
- Any questions?

10:04.691 --> 10:08.042
Hmm. South Korea.

10:08.085 --> 10:10.653
Let's go.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.263
- Jason.
- Yeah?

10:13.264 --> 10:15.658
Do you, uh,
want me rolling on this one,

10:15.702 --> 10:18.313
or you want me to stay focused
on my therapy?

10:18.356 --> 10:20.445
No, no, no. Training will be
good for you, get your feet wet.

10:20.489 --> 10:22.534
- You need it.
- I think it's time

10:22.578 --> 10:24.145
I come clean to Bravo
about everything.

10:24.188 --> 10:26.190
I don't want to hide things
from 'em anymore.

10:26.234 --> 10:28.410
What are you talking about?
You got nothing to hide, man.

10:28.453 --> 10:30.542
You're good now, right?
You're good.

10:30.586 --> 10:33.371
If one of my brothers
went sideways outside the wire,

10:33.415 --> 10:35.547
I might be looking for you
to sideline them

10:35.591 --> 10:36.897
until they were squared away.

10:36.940 --> 10:37.898
It's been three months.
You're good.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.595
But you're the only one

10:39.639 --> 10:41.641
that knows I've been working
on my PTS since then.

10:41.684 --> 10:43.425
- The boys think
I just been learning languages.
- Okay, Ray,

10:43.468 --> 10:47.603
we both know that all it takes
is one ignorant cake eater

10:47.647 --> 10:50.824
to get a sniff or hint
that you got PTS,

10:50.867 --> 10:52.826
and they'll pull you
from operating.

10:52.869 --> 10:53.957
For good.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.132
That's all Bravo needs to see

10:55.176 --> 10:56.307
is you go out there training.

10:56.351 --> 10:57.874
That's all they need to know.

10:57.918 --> 11:00.398
- Go home.

11:00.442 --> 11:02.400
Roger that.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.451
What are you doing?

11:09.494 --> 11:10.974
Is the baby okay?

11:11.018 --> 11:12.367
Yeah.

11:12.410 --> 11:14.891
I, uh...

11:14.935 --> 11:17.677
I got called back early.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.896
Got to leave for Vah Beach
in a couple of hours.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.507
I thought you had
two more weeks.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.684
Yeah.

11:27.077 --> 11:29.210
Well, at least wake Leanne up

11:29.253 --> 11:31.038
- for a proper goodbye.
- No.

11:31.081 --> 11:34.563
No, I worked so hard
to get her on that nap cycle.

11:34.606 --> 11:36.870
I don't want to break it.

11:38.523 --> 11:40.351
Hey.

11:40.395 --> 11:43.790
Hey, munchkin,
Daddy's got to go, okay?

11:43.833 --> 11:47.315
But I'm gonna race back
as soon as I can to see you.

11:48.577 --> 11:50.057
I love you.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.407
I'll come running back.

11:54.844 --> 11:57.107
- All right.
- She's gonna miss her daddy.

11:57.151 --> 11:58.630
Mm.

11:58.674 --> 12:00.850
I'll see you.

12:13.123 --> 12:15.299
You know, sorry I'm, uh,
blowing out of here.

12:15.343 --> 12:16.953
You know, I just...
But you guys,

12:16.997 --> 12:18.563
you know the drill, right?

12:18.607 --> 12:20.435
I really was looking forward

12:20.478 --> 12:22.829
- to driving you both back
to school, but...
Us, too.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.439
- Next time.
Next time.

12:24.482 --> 12:26.049
Don't worry, Emma found us
a replacement ride.

12:26.093 --> 12:28.008
Whoa, whoa, what do you mean,
a replacement?

12:28.051 --> 12:30.837
Um, Brad's offered to drive.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.187
That way I don't have to drive
in the city alone

12:33.230 --> 12:34.971
after dropping Mikey off.

12:35.015 --> 12:36.668
- Brad.
- Yeah.

12:36.712 --> 12:38.801
Yeah, I actually don't hate
that idea.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.021
Extra set of eyes and ears
never hurt.

12:41.064 --> 12:43.153
Well, let's just make sure
that the eyes and the ears

12:43.197 --> 12:44.894
are the only thing
that he's offering up. Got it?

12:44.938 --> 12:46.940
- Gross, Dad.
- I'm your dad, okay?

12:46.983 --> 12:48.855
- I'm supposed to say
that kind of stuff.
- But if you want to talk

12:48.898 --> 12:50.073
about people offering up...

12:50.117 --> 12:51.988
Eva seemed nice.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.511
- I liked her.

12:53.555 --> 12:54.904
The two of you were both
in on this

12:54.948 --> 12:56.645
with Naima, weren't you, huh?

12:56.688 --> 12:58.952
You keep saying Bravo 1
and Jason Hayes can coexist.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.649
Mikey and I are doing fine,

13:00.692 --> 13:02.869
so it seems like you have time
for a relationship.

13:02.912 --> 13:05.132
It's not that easy.
You don't just meet somebody

13:05.175 --> 13:07.612
at a party, and all of a sudden
you're in a relationship.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.092
Sounds like an excuse.

13:09.136 --> 13:11.181
You deserve to have a life,
a full life.

13:11.225 --> 13:12.617
Okay.

13:12.661 --> 13:14.402
If you're not evolving,

13:14.445 --> 13:16.230
- you're falling behind, Dad.
- You're falling behind, huh?

13:16.273 --> 13:18.232
- Oh, God.
- Okay, I'll tell you what.

13:18.275 --> 13:20.103
<i>Maybe</i> I'll call her

13:20.147 --> 13:21.888
- when I get back.

13:28.068 --> 13:29.721
Look, this joint training

13:29.765 --> 13:31.854
won't put our honeymoon
in jeopardy, all right?

13:31.898 --> 13:33.638
I promise.

13:38.556 --> 13:41.951
- Let's get
that big brain churning.
- The party yesterday,

13:41.995 --> 13:44.432
when Jason didn't get your,
um, rock climbing reference,

13:44.475 --> 13:46.564
you seemed kind of spooked.

13:46.608 --> 13:48.958
Like you did
at our wedding reception.

13:51.265 --> 13:53.223
Jason's 20 years of combat,

13:53.267 --> 13:55.747
does that
still have you worried?

13:55.791 --> 13:58.533
You know, headaches,
memory loss.

13:58.576 --> 14:00.143
I just...

14:00.187 --> 14:03.190
hope there's not something
going on inside his head.

14:04.191 --> 14:05.845
Like Swanny?

14:06.846 --> 14:08.978
If Jason has
a traumatic brain injury,

14:09.022 --> 14:10.980
he's not fit to lead Bravo.

14:12.025 --> 14:14.201
I know that.
You know, it's just,

14:14.244 --> 14:16.203
I'm not even sure
there's anything wrong.

14:16.246 --> 14:19.032
Well, you spent most of
the last three months with him.

14:19.075 --> 14:22.078
Any other signs
that you've witnessed?

14:22.122 --> 14:23.906
None, really.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.169
He's been himself.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.041
Better than himself, actually.

14:28.084 --> 14:30.870
So the headache and the missed
reference three months apart

14:30.913 --> 14:33.611
shouldn't be an indictment
on Jason's health.

14:33.655 --> 14:36.136
You're right.

14:36.179 --> 14:37.964
It's probably nothing.

14:38.007 --> 14:40.967
So, how was her gas
after her bottle, huh?

14:41.010 --> 14:45.058
- Normal tootsies and burpies?

14:45.101 --> 14:47.016
- Yeah, all right, all right.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.497
Hey... I got to go, all right?

14:49.540 --> 14:50.890
I love you, monkey.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.630
See, all that training
down in Texas

14:52.674 --> 14:54.719
has really turned you
into a Tier One Mr. Mom.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.591
Well, aren't you all a sight

14:56.634 --> 14:58.593
- for sore eyes.
- How's that
little girl doing, huh?

14:58.636 --> 15:00.595
Uh, she's good, man.
Hey, uh, thanks again

15:00.638 --> 15:03.163
for pulling those strings
and having me train down there.

15:03.206 --> 15:04.816
Yeah, I really cherished
my time with her.

15:04.860 --> 15:08.081
Yeah, we cherished our time
without you, too, Sonny.

15:08.124 --> 15:10.387
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Since when's our XO, uh,

15:10.431 --> 15:11.823
joining us on training ops?

15:11.867 --> 15:13.651
Since there is no training op.

15:13.695 --> 15:16.567
Wait, we're spinning up?

15:16.611 --> 15:18.265
Apologies for the misdirect,

15:18.308 --> 15:21.485
but this rollout comes
from way above me.

15:21.529 --> 15:23.574
You'll receive more information
when we're on the ground

15:23.618 --> 15:25.228
- at Yongsan Base.
- All right, Blackburn,

15:25.272 --> 15:27.448
come on, what's up
with the cloak-and-dagger here?

15:29.929 --> 15:34.020
Bravo Team will be conducting an
operation inside of North Korea.

15:55.128 --> 15:58.653
A lot more good idea fairies
than usual, huh?

15:58.696 --> 16:01.003
Yeah. Running an op
inside of a country

16:01.047 --> 16:04.050
we're still technically
at war with will do that.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.183
Mission brings us
to the brink of Armageddon.

16:07.227 --> 16:09.620
So much for easing back
into things.

16:09.664 --> 16:11.535
Chips are down.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.581
The command's got to play
their best hand.

16:13.624 --> 16:15.017
Just hope we're not one card
short of a straight flush.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.932
Here they come.

16:22.677 --> 16:25.027
Welcome to South Korea,
Bravo Team.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.855
I'm sure
your heads are spinning

16:26.898 --> 16:29.379
given the nature of this op,
but focus up.

16:29.423 --> 16:32.730
If this mission isn't executed
to perfection,

16:32.774 --> 16:35.211
the consequences
could be catastrophic.

16:36.212 --> 16:39.041
This is Jin Yong,
better known as the godfather

16:39.085 --> 16:40.956
of the North Korean
weapons program.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.392
Guessing soon to be
former godfather.

16:42.436 --> 16:44.046
Yeah, but not how you'd think.

16:44.090 --> 16:46.092
South Koreans believe
that Jin wants to defect.

16:46.135 --> 16:49.747
Gaining access to what he knows
would be an intelligence coup.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.880
Well, how strong is the intel
that this guy wants to defect?

16:51.923 --> 16:53.664
Depends on how strong
his marriage is.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.144
18 months ago,
his wife defected.

16:55.188 --> 16:56.493
- She's our source.
Can't imagine

16:56.537 --> 16:58.104
her run for freedom
scored him points

16:58.147 --> 16:59.105
with the regime.

16:59.148 --> 17:00.149
Got him excommunicated

17:00.193 --> 17:01.237
to the Komusan region

17:01.281 --> 17:02.978
near the Chinese border.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.327
What, they send him
to a work camp?

17:04.371 --> 17:06.373
No, he is overseeing
a weapons project

17:06.416 --> 17:08.331
under the careful watch
of the military

17:08.375 --> 17:10.029
and secret police.

17:10.072 --> 17:12.074
Fact that they hadn't executed
him speaks to his value.

17:12.118 --> 17:13.510
And why we're willing
to risk so much

17:13.554 --> 17:14.946
getting him out of the country.

17:14.990 --> 17:16.513
Bravo won't be getting him out.

17:16.557 --> 17:18.298
A North Korean smuggler will.

17:18.341 --> 17:20.256
Kwan Jon-Wi.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.084
Defected from North Korea
a decade ago

17:22.128 --> 17:24.478
and is now running
an underground railroad network.

17:24.521 --> 17:25.957
If Kwan has a network,

17:26.001 --> 17:27.350
what does she need us for?

17:27.394 --> 17:29.135
Usual tricks won't work
with so many eyes

17:29.178 --> 17:31.137
on a VIP like Jin.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.356
Kwan's been on the ground
for weeks

17:33.400 --> 17:35.967
and has formulated a plan
to ferry Jin out of the country

17:36.011 --> 17:37.882
by crossing
an electrified river.

17:37.926 --> 17:40.059
I'm sorry, an electrified river?

17:40.102 --> 17:42.713
- SOTO:
- Countermeasure to defectors and invaders.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.063
Bravo will shut the power down

17:44.106 --> 17:46.021
before Kwan and Jin
hit the water.

17:46.065 --> 17:49.285
If Kwan reaches downriver,
you'll exfil to the coast,

17:49.329 --> 17:51.418
swim out
before anyone's the wiser.

17:51.461 --> 17:53.898
Zero footprint. Zero kill.

17:55.248 --> 17:56.640
Okay, that's
all great information,

17:56.684 --> 17:58.120
but how do we infiltrate

17:58.164 --> 17:59.774
the most fortified country
in the world?

17:59.817 --> 18:01.819
Well, we can't figure it all out
for you, Master Chief.

18:01.863 --> 18:04.561
It is on Bravo to tell us
your best way inside.

18:04.605 --> 18:07.651
Op's not a go
till you have actions on.

18:13.701 --> 18:15.529
Okay, call me paranoid,

18:15.572 --> 18:18.271
but you not talking to me
that whole flight over

18:18.314 --> 18:20.925
makes me feel like you're
giving me the cold shoulder.

18:20.969 --> 18:23.754
No, I'm sorry. I'm-I'm playing
catch-up on this op.

18:23.798 --> 18:27.062
O-Okay, well, look, keeping us
from starting World War III

18:27.106 --> 18:30.631
is much better use of your time
than seeing baby pics, but...

18:30.674 --> 18:32.850
- Oh, I'm sorry,
did I miss my chance?
- Oh, I... All right.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.939
- Okay, Sonny, this is stupid.

18:35.984 --> 18:37.072
- Wow.
- Yeah.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.118
This is cute. So...

18:39.161 --> 18:41.076
how is dad life?

18:41.120 --> 18:43.078
It's incredible. It is.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.341
Ah, she's got me eating
right out of her hand.

18:45.385 --> 18:49.606
I'm just... I'm so glad
you had so much time to visit.

18:49.650 --> 18:51.608
I mean, it'd be more
than just a visit

18:51.652 --> 18:54.133
if you'd take me up on my offer
and move to Texas.

18:54.176 --> 18:58.920
You're acting like that wasn't
some whiskey-fueled fantasy.

18:58.963 --> 19:00.400
How do you feel
about quitting Bravo

19:00.443 --> 19:02.706
after spending three months
on base there?

19:02.750 --> 19:04.926
You know,
my time in Texas made me realize

19:04.969 --> 19:07.798
I love three things

19:07.842 --> 19:10.584
Leanne, Bravo...

19:10.627 --> 19:12.194
and you.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.631
Now, it just doesn't seem fair

19:14.675 --> 19:17.721
that we can't get them all
to coexist.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.377
Look...

19:21.421 --> 19:24.554
you're right, I know the
situation with us isn't fair.

19:24.598 --> 19:27.166
But it's also not changing.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.690
It's time we both accept that,

19:29.733 --> 19:32.736
you know, and...

19:32.780 --> 19:35.261
forge new paths.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.225
<i>Been tasked</i>

19:43.269 --> 19:45.009
with some tall orders before,

19:45.053 --> 19:46.881
but getting into North Korea
is like breaking into Fort Knox.

19:46.924 --> 19:49.318
- Mm-hmm.
- Whole country's designed
to keep people out.

19:49.362 --> 19:51.190
Electrified fences,

19:51.233 --> 19:53.192
surveillance cameras,
and we have to overcome all that

19:53.235 --> 19:55.368
without using force
or any of our usual toys.

19:55.411 --> 19:58.327
No ISR. No heavy weapons.
No RF signature.

19:58.371 --> 20:00.155
Old-school teams
for an old-school op.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.070
And remember, it's not our gear
that makes us the best.

20:02.113 --> 20:04.986
I agree, boss, but if anyone so
much as catches a whiff of us,

20:05.029 --> 20:06.727
we're screwed.

20:06.770 --> 20:09.208
I know fatherhood
has softened me up, but...

20:09.251 --> 20:11.601
a North Korean death camp
doesn't have much appeal.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.255
Look, without overwatch,
we need an infil

20:13.299 --> 20:15.214
that minimizes our exposure.

20:15.257 --> 20:17.738
That eliminates
a border crossing.

20:17.781 --> 20:21.481
Could swim in,
work our exfil in reverse.

20:21.524 --> 20:24.353
Less eyes on the coast.
Safe in, safe out.

20:24.397 --> 20:25.833
Got to be underground by sunup.

20:25.876 --> 20:27.965
HAHO from over the Sea of Japan

20:28.009 --> 20:30.229
could carry us
into Jin's region.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.665
Nah, the North Koreans would be

20:31.708 --> 20:34.058
all over a military plane
off their coast.

20:34.102 --> 20:35.582
You know what?

20:37.323 --> 20:39.629
Looks like we need to book
a flight to Vladivostok.

20:39.673 --> 20:42.371
Why the hell
we flying to Russia?

20:49.900 --> 20:52.251
Plenty of seats
to pick from, boys.

20:53.991 --> 20:58.039
Ah, it's about time Bravo gets
the "rock star" treatment.

20:59.214 --> 21:00.998
Flying on a commercial airline

21:01.042 --> 21:03.174
to an op, and somehow
I still get stuck in coach.

21:03.218 --> 21:06.526
Long way from having to up-armor
Humvees on our own dime.

21:06.569 --> 21:09.050
Navy sure splurged
chartering this flight.

21:09.093 --> 21:11.792
They're probably gonna take
a bite out of us somehow.

21:11.835 --> 21:14.969
Probably charge us
for pillows and headsets,

21:15.012 --> 21:17.928
knowing them.
Buckle in, guys.

21:17.972 --> 21:20.104
Gonna be a bumpy ride.

21:23.673 --> 21:26.633
Sonny, you know, seriously...

21:26.676 --> 21:28.896
plenty of seats
to choose from here.

21:28.939 --> 21:31.681
You don't need
to be squeezing me like this.

21:31.725 --> 21:33.727
Everything okay back home?

21:33.770 --> 21:36.295
- I'm sure it was tough
leaving Leanne.
- Yeah.

21:36.338 --> 21:39.472
- Hmm?
- I got Bravo on my mind,

21:39.515 --> 21:44.215
you know, given that we're,
uh, jumping into a viper's nest,

21:44.259 --> 21:46.914
blindfolded with our hands tied
behind our back.

21:48.263 --> 21:50.570
We can handle it, Sonny,
we can handle it.

21:50.613 --> 21:52.572
I know we can.

21:52.615 --> 21:54.574
- But can everyone?

21:58.665 --> 22:03.452
Ray was a liability
all last deployment.

22:03.496 --> 22:05.846
Ray's fine. He wouldn't
be here if he wasn't.

22:05.889 --> 22:09.197
Need I remind you, you weren't
a, uh, model sailor, either?

22:09.240 --> 22:11.504
No, uh...

22:11.547 --> 22:14.289
All of my issues stayed
on the boat, Jace.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.857
I didn't endanger anyone.

22:16.900 --> 22:19.338
Ray damn near got Brock killed.

22:19.381 --> 22:22.515
It's hard to operate
when you can't trust

22:22.558 --> 22:24.952
the men to your right or left.

22:26.432 --> 22:28.912
What if he freezes up again?

22:29.913 --> 22:31.698
It's my call.

22:31.741 --> 22:34.265
Yeah, well, your call was made
when you thought this was

22:34.309 --> 22:37.356
- just a training operation.
- Hmm.

22:37.399 --> 22:42.317
J, your loyalty to Ray
is admirable,

22:42.361 --> 22:45.320
but it's starting to blind you
on what's best for Bravo.

22:46.669 --> 22:49.890
You questioning Ray's judgment
or mine?

23:04.426 --> 23:06.515
Hey. South Korean intelligence
confirms that Kwan is ready

23:06.559 --> 23:08.082
to link up with Bravo.

23:08.125 --> 23:09.736
I sent the team
the rally point coordinates.

23:09.779 --> 23:12.260
Well, all goes
according to plan,

23:12.303 --> 23:14.262
Bravo will only be
on North Korean soil

23:14.305 --> 23:16.438
for less than 24 hours.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.135
It'll be a long day.

23:18.179 --> 23:20.442
- We're used to those
around here.

23:23.010 --> 23:24.577
Do I detect any regrets

23:24.620 --> 23:26.622
about you not pursuing
that SOCOM position?

23:26.666 --> 23:28.972
Fighting for justice
against a sexual predator

23:29.016 --> 23:30.365
was the right call.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.845
But...

23:31.888 --> 23:33.847
Bravo running an op like this

23:33.890 --> 23:35.501
reminds me
why SOCOM had appeal.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.111
Hoping your new DoD fellowship

23:37.154 --> 23:39.679
will open up
some new doors, huh?

23:39.722 --> 23:43.639
- Those are powerful elbows
you're rubbing.
- I'm just broadening

23:43.683 --> 23:45.772
my horizons.

23:45.815 --> 23:48.165
Taking over a commercial flight
for infil.

23:48.209 --> 23:50.124
This is a new one for me.

23:50.167 --> 23:52.387
Can't imagine
the strings pulled on this.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.128
Still getting used to swimming
in the DEVGRU deep end,

23:54.171 --> 23:56.043
- Lieutenant?
- They just left

23:56.086 --> 23:57.610
South Korean airspace.

23:57.653 --> 23:59.350
We're about to be past
the point of no return.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.500
Time to go.

24:18.544 --> 24:20.502
Scratch HAHOing
from a commercial airliner

24:20.546 --> 24:21.938
off your bucket list.

24:21.982 --> 24:24.375
Playing D.B. Cooper
at 40,000 feet

24:24.419 --> 24:26.595
over shark-infested waters
of the Sea of Japan

24:26.639 --> 24:28.379
ain't on mine.

24:28.423 --> 24:30.817
So much can go wrong
during this jump,

24:30.860 --> 24:33.559
becoming shark food should be
the least of your worries.

24:33.602 --> 24:35.082
How are the winds?

24:35.125 --> 24:36.257
Okay.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.780
Masks on.

25:16.340 --> 25:19.518
Bravo is in enemy airspace.

25:20.997 --> 25:22.956
How's their flight path?

25:22.999 --> 25:25.088
They're tracking
to bull's-eye the LZ.

25:25.132 --> 25:26.742
The plan is holding.

25:26.786 --> 25:28.352
It better.

25:28.396 --> 25:31.878
Bravo won't make it home
if it doesn't.

26:21.928 --> 26:23.973
This is the rally point.

26:24.017 --> 26:26.585
Where's our smuggler?

26:26.628 --> 26:28.761
Lot of faith we're putting
in her.

26:28.804 --> 26:31.198
You do realize
if we rip our britches

26:31.241 --> 26:33.504
that Dennis Rodman is
our only hope

26:33.548 --> 26:35.332
of smelling freedom again.

26:38.118 --> 26:39.815
Think I got something.

27:04.187 --> 27:06.973
I'm Kwan.
Welcome to North Korea.

27:09.192 --> 27:11.542
Master Chief Hayes.
This is Bravo.

27:11.586 --> 27:13.414
How far to the shelter?

27:13.457 --> 27:15.503
Ten klicks. Need to hurry.

27:44.053 --> 27:46.534
I've been in torpedo tubes
with more charm.

27:47.535 --> 27:49.493
Place is a relic
from the Korean War.

27:49.537 --> 27:52.279
I've called it home
for the past month.

27:52.322 --> 27:54.890
Air definitely has
a nostalgic whiff to it.

27:54.934 --> 27:57.153
Hey. Get the cloud relay up

27:57.197 --> 27:59.590
- so we can get our comms up
and running, huh?
- Yeah.

28:06.554 --> 28:07.947
Don't worry.

28:07.990 --> 28:09.949
This will ensure
the North Koreans can't hear us.

28:12.255 --> 28:15.955
This bunker offers a good view
of where Jin is housed,

28:15.998 --> 28:16.999
and it's safe.

28:17.043 --> 28:19.045
Safe? We're in a country

28:19.088 --> 28:21.569
where its citizens take an oath
to kill Americans, ma'am.

28:21.612 --> 28:23.179
It's like being

28:23.223 --> 28:24.659
a UT fan at a Oklahoma game.

28:24.703 --> 28:25.791
Brock, Trent,

28:25.834 --> 28:27.662
pull security.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.533
You're certain that
this compound is the best place

28:29.577 --> 28:31.013
for you to grab him?

28:31.057 --> 28:32.406
- Are you questioning my plan?
- I'm questioning

28:32.449 --> 28:33.581
if it's the right plan.

28:33.624 --> 28:35.061
Because if your plan goes
to hell,

28:35.104 --> 28:37.846
it's my men who's caught
behind enemy lines.

28:39.065 --> 28:43.373
Jin goes to work every day,
picked up at 0800,

28:43.417 --> 28:45.854
escorted by secret police.

28:45.898 --> 28:49.118
The lab is crawling
with soldiers and police.

28:49.162 --> 28:51.251
Where he's housed offers
fewer risks.

28:51.294 --> 28:54.428
He returns every night at 2100,

28:54.471 --> 28:56.473
has dinner
with his other workers,

28:56.517 --> 29:00.129
then goes for a stroll at 2130
every other evening.

29:00.173 --> 29:02.218
Got to burn off
both those calories.

29:02.262 --> 29:04.090
Is he escorted during his walks?

29:04.133 --> 29:06.135
He's always alone.

29:06.179 --> 29:08.137
The southeast corner
of the compound

29:08.181 --> 29:10.792
is in the guard tower's
blind spot.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.446
That's where
I will approach him.

29:12.489 --> 29:14.317
When he disappears,
the guard tower will assume

29:14.361 --> 29:16.319
- he's gone to bed.
- What about the guards
inside the dorm?

29:16.363 --> 29:17.886
They'll know that
he didn't come back.

29:17.930 --> 29:19.540
There are no guards inside,

29:19.583 --> 29:22.282
just roaming patrol
around the compound.

29:22.325 --> 29:23.805
We're in the middle of nowhere.

29:23.849 --> 29:26.068
They're not worried
about anyone running.

29:26.112 --> 29:29.463
Once I've made contact,
I'll drive Jin to the riverbank

29:29.506 --> 29:32.205
and have him over the border
before daybreak.

29:32.248 --> 29:34.207
Okay. Plan's simple.

29:34.250 --> 29:35.730
This will work.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.472
Assuming you keep
your part of the deal.

29:38.515 --> 29:41.040
Well, what happens
if Jin doesn't go with you?

29:41.083 --> 29:43.303
His wife gave me a phrase
that will win his trust.

29:43.346 --> 29:45.958
Who else knows
Jin's your target?

29:46.001 --> 29:48.917
- Nobody.
- Does your network know
you're working with Americans?

29:48.961 --> 29:51.920
- No.
- What, you can't trust
your partners?

29:51.964 --> 29:55.706
In North Korea you trust nobody.

29:58.144 --> 29:59.885
Well, that's reassuring.

30:00.886 --> 30:04.193
Thought you were warriors,
not worriers.

30:06.935 --> 30:09.155
Read us in on the power station.

30:09.198 --> 30:11.200
Master Chief Hayes checked in
during the comms window.

30:11.244 --> 30:13.333
Bravo's settled in
and prepping for the op.

30:13.376 --> 30:15.901
Comms window every four hours
isn't exactly ideal,

30:15.944 --> 30:18.773
but it's better than being
completely in the dark.

30:20.079 --> 30:21.689
Anything from the South Koreans?

30:21.732 --> 30:23.038
They're monitoring chatter
and troops' movements.

30:23.082 --> 30:24.474
Nothing unusual.

30:24.518 --> 30:26.346
Let's hope it stays that way.

30:26.389 --> 30:29.392
Want our boys out of the Hermit
Kingdom as soon as possible.

30:29.436 --> 30:31.525
Last deployment taught me
to never be comfortable

30:31.568 --> 30:33.657
when my team steps
outside the wire.

30:34.658 --> 30:36.965
Full Metal's death
hit us all hard.

30:37.966 --> 30:39.838
Wish I could tell you
it gets easier.

30:42.753 --> 30:44.364
<i>They put a knife to my neck</i>

30:44.407 --> 30:46.192
<i>and finally delivered
on their promise.</i>

30:46.235 --> 30:49.717
<i>But it wasn't my throat slashed,
it was Zied's.</i>

31:02.512 --> 31:03.905
Let me ask you something.

31:03.949 --> 31:06.168
You got concerns
about Ray rolling with us?

31:07.169 --> 31:10.912
Nobody's been around him much
the last three months.

31:10.956 --> 31:13.132
After how he behaved
on deployment,

31:13.175 --> 31:15.177
thought you
might stand him down.

31:15.221 --> 31:17.440
But I trust your instincts.

31:17.484 --> 31:19.051
Mm.

31:19.094 --> 31:21.009
The others don't seem to.

31:22.010 --> 31:24.926
We weren't in the fight
when Ray froze up.

31:24.970 --> 31:27.102
Sonny, Trent and Brock were.

31:27.146 --> 31:29.800
That's probably why they
haven't gotten over it.

31:31.977 --> 31:34.153
I just hope Ray has.

31:50.691 --> 31:52.823
You work in English?

31:52.867 --> 31:55.000
I can't carry my notebook on me.

31:55.043 --> 31:57.611
If it's discovered
in the middle of our operation,

31:57.654 --> 32:00.353
people in these parts
can't read English.

32:00.396 --> 32:02.746
They'll know something's off
but won't know what.

32:02.790 --> 32:04.139
Buys you time.

32:04.183 --> 32:05.880
Don't leave any stone unturned--

32:05.924 --> 32:07.751
is that the secret
to your success?

32:07.795 --> 32:11.190
Calling me a success
is an exaggeration.

32:11.233 --> 32:13.540
I've had my share of defeats.

32:13.583 --> 32:15.411
You know, I can't say
I've ever met someone

32:15.455 --> 32:18.893
who repeatedly breaks back into
a country they broke out of.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.417
I question my sanity sometimes.

32:21.461 --> 32:23.898
When I finally made it
to South Korea,

32:23.942 --> 32:27.467
I promised I'd never set foot
in this country again.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.817
Promise you keep breaking.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.601
Why?

32:32.907 --> 32:34.778
Comfort.

32:34.822 --> 32:36.955
All this brings you comfort?

32:38.391 --> 32:41.394
In Seoul, I found comfort...

32:41.437 --> 32:43.004
freedom...

32:43.048 --> 32:44.788
happiness.

32:45.789 --> 32:47.356
But then guilt.

32:48.531 --> 32:51.143
Hard to enjoy good fortune
with that weighing on you.

32:52.927 --> 32:56.975
One day I'm eating <i>chimaek
and watching soap operas</i>

32:57.018 --> 32:59.803
only a few miles away

32:59.847 --> 33:02.893
my former countrymen
are eating pine bark

33:02.937 --> 33:06.027
and polishing photos
of their leader out of fear

33:06.071 --> 33:08.203
of being sent to the gulag.

33:11.250 --> 33:14.993
In that moment,
I found my calling.

33:16.037 --> 33:17.560
Knowing you're out there

33:17.604 --> 33:19.736
provides hope
for those who need it the most.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.915
Ray, time to jock up.

33:25.873 --> 33:27.483
Excuse me.

33:31.357 --> 33:33.446
I never observed more
than four guards at the station.

33:33.489 --> 33:36.057
- One in the tower, three inside.
- The op will be over

33:36.101 --> 33:37.624
before it starts
if someone's on the other side

33:37.667 --> 33:39.278
of any door we kick.

33:39.321 --> 33:41.193
Please don't kick anything.
Silence is your ally.

33:41.236 --> 33:43.717
That's a figure of speech
for us, ma'am.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.067
Just remember,
we fire a shot or we use force,

33:46.111 --> 33:47.851
- total mission failure.
One misstep

33:47.895 --> 33:50.811
or hesitation could cost us
everything out there.

33:53.379 --> 33:54.989
How you splitting us up?

33:55.033 --> 33:58.340
Clay, Sonny, Brock
with me at the substation.

33:58.384 --> 34:00.038
Ray, Trent,

34:00.081 --> 34:01.909
eyes on Kwan and Jin. Copy?

34:01.952 --> 34:04.259
- Roger that.
Once I have Jin,

34:04.303 --> 34:06.522
it will take me ten minutes
to make it to the river.

34:06.566 --> 34:09.177
Creating the power surge
should take us less than that.

34:09.221 --> 34:12.093
- We'll start as soon as Ray
and Trent get eyes on you.
Jin's defection

34:12.137 --> 34:13.660
will embarrass the regime

34:13.703 --> 34:15.618
and hopefully ease the suffering
of my people.

34:15.662 --> 34:18.360
You're helping many
by helping me.

34:18.404 --> 34:20.014
Safe journey, Kwan.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.060
Same to all of you.

34:28.196 --> 34:30.329
Let's go. Roll out in five.

34:43.603 --> 34:45.300
One guard.

34:45.344 --> 34:48.173
Doesn't have an angle
on our planned route.

34:49.174 --> 34:51.785
Just like Kwan said.

35:09.803 --> 35:12.806
Didn't see any wires running
overhead to the transformers.

35:12.849 --> 35:15.025
Breaker room should be
on the first deck.

35:24.557 --> 35:26.950
Any sign of Jin?

35:26.994 --> 35:29.736
Nothing yet.
Any movement on the road?

35:31.041 --> 35:32.869
Negative.

35:34.001 --> 35:37.047
Should give Kwan a straight shot
to the riverbank.

35:39.528 --> 35:43.358
Wait a minute, here we go.
I got something.

35:49.059 --> 35:50.800
It's Jin.

35:52.976 --> 35:55.457
Right on time.

35:56.937 --> 35:58.982
No one's paying him
any attention.

35:59.026 --> 36:02.290
Yeah. Time for Kwan
to wrap this thing up.

36:02.334 --> 36:04.684
Yeah.

36:05.685 --> 36:07.861
There's still no sign of her.

37:20.325 --> 37:22.849
This place is a death trap.

37:22.892 --> 37:25.112
Find the panel, set the bypass.

37:25.155 --> 37:26.940
Getting electrocuted
in North Korea

37:26.983 --> 37:29.290
isn't exactly how I want to go.

37:29.334 --> 37:30.813
I'm sure Kwan
doesn't want to, either.

37:32.119 --> 37:33.816
Hey. Lot of noise out there.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.775
It's just hard to tell
where it's coming from.

37:35.818 --> 37:37.733
- Check it out.
- Roger that.

38:33.876 --> 38:36.662
Guys, spotted six guards,
could be more.

38:36.705 --> 38:38.925
Kwan said there was only three.

38:38.968 --> 38:41.319
More eyes to spot us.
More anxious minds

38:41.362 --> 38:44.365
- asking questions
when the power goes down.
We're fish in a barrel

38:44.409 --> 38:46.889
if they start poking around
down here.

38:54.636 --> 38:57.073
What's the call, Jace?
Pull the plug now,

38:57.117 --> 38:59.511
- we can slip out undetected.
- Look, the entire op's
contingent on what we do here.

38:59.554 --> 39:01.513
We hold what we got.

39:02.644 --> 39:05.952
Don't want to be here any longer
than we need to, either, but...

39:07.127 --> 39:08.302
I found it.

39:09.608 --> 39:10.870
2, this is 1.

39:10.913 --> 39:12.262
<i>What's going on out there?</i>

39:12.306 --> 39:14.177
Samson is still out
for his stroll,

39:14.221 --> 39:16.049
but he's probably
on his last lap.

39:16.092 --> 39:17.572
<i>Good copy.</i>

39:17.616 --> 39:19.444
Looks like he's slowing down
a little bit.

39:19.487 --> 39:23.012
Yeah. If he decides to end
his walk early, we're screwed.

39:25.101 --> 39:27.495
A vehicle approaching
from the east.

39:34.502 --> 39:36.635
1, this is 2.

39:36.678 --> 39:38.201
Pass "Price."

39:38.245 --> 39:39.507
Copy "Price."

39:39.551 --> 39:42.684
Kwan's en route.
Get the bypass ready.

39:42.728 --> 39:45.034
Keeps us here
another ten minutes.

39:45.078 --> 39:47.210
Soon as that power is down,

39:47.254 --> 39:49.604
we Charlie Mike.

39:49.648 --> 39:51.301
<i>1, this is 3.</i>

39:51.345 --> 39:54.261
<i>We got to move.
Two tangos heading downstairs.</i>

39:55.697 --> 39:57.699
Keep coming, keep coming.

39:57.743 --> 40:00.049
She's about 30 seconds
form the rally point.

40:00.093 --> 40:03.139
Jin should just be getting
to the blind spot then.

40:03.183 --> 40:04.706
Keep coming.

40:04.750 --> 40:07.013
Keep coming, keep coming.

40:08.754 --> 40:10.756
What the hell's going on?

40:10.799 --> 40:13.193
Secret police.

40:18.154 --> 40:19.808
No. Damn it.

40:19.852 --> 40:21.984
No, no, no, no.

40:22.028 --> 40:23.638
Bravo 1, this is 2.

40:23.682 --> 40:25.727
<i>-I pass "Earthquake."
- Say again your last.</i>

40:25.771 --> 40:27.250
<i>I say again, "Earthquake."</i>

40:27.294 --> 40:28.991
Copy "Earthquake."
Virgil's off the board.

40:29.035 --> 40:30.471
Kwan's been rolled up.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.481
Hey, guards are
on their way down here.

40:40.525 --> 40:42.091
We got to turn and burn.

40:43.092 --> 40:45.355
If the North Koreans know
about Kwan...

40:45.399 --> 40:47.357
They might know about us.

40:47.401 --> 40:50.273
Could explain
the extra boots down here.

40:53.320 --> 40:55.278
I thought that rig was supposed
to make the river safe,

40:55.322 --> 40:56.541
not black out
the whole building.

40:56.584 --> 40:58.107
Yeah, that was the idea.

40:58.151 --> 41:00.414
If it blows the power,
they're gonna be in here

41:00.458 --> 41:01.720
checking the fuses in no time.

41:01.763 --> 41:03.243
Op's been compromised.

41:03.286 --> 41:04.679
Pull it. Pull it.

41:04.723 --> 41:06.420
Come on, let's go, Blond Edison.

41:16.082 --> 41:18.476
Got no idea how many guards
are on-site now.

41:18.519 --> 41:20.390
Gonna be a lot quicker to
schwack our way out of this,

41:20.434 --> 41:21.740
K-pop these clowns and go.

41:21.783 --> 41:24.220
And start a thermonuclear war?

41:24.264 --> 41:26.266
ROEs still stand.

41:26.309 --> 41:28.050
We do not fire a shot
unless we have to.

41:28.094 --> 41:30.270
Brock, lead us out.
