00:23.490 --> 00:24.752
Here he comes, Mac.

00:25.458 --> 00:26.755
Use the gun.

00:28.528 --> 00:31.929
There's no earthly material that the
new split-particle beam can't melt down.

00:32.131 --> 00:34.259
So this is gonna cut us
into the diamond vault, huh?

00:34.334 --> 00:36.632
Welcome aboard.
Wherever I can help.

00:38.438 --> 00:41.373
Assuming one couldn't
prefer being called a nerd...

00:41.441 --> 00:42.601
why does he act like one?

00:42.675 --> 00:46.111
How much extra protection
is this gonna give us anyway?

00:46.346 --> 00:47.540
Ten seconds, Michael.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.815
He's heading straight for us.
He'll never make it.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.442
Michael, we're burning up.

01:05.298 --> 01:07.732
Knight Rider,
a shadowy flight...

01:07.801 --> 01:10.133
into the dangerous world
of a man...

01:10.203 --> 01:11.932
who does not exist.

01:20.113 --> 01:22.013
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:22.082 --> 01:24.744
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:24.818 --> 01:27.082
the helpless, the powerless...

01:27.153 --> 01:30.213
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.066
Come on, give me something.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.237
Shh. They'll hear you.

02:26.312 --> 02:27.438
Oh, smile.

02:27.514 --> 02:30.506
You know, according to Who's
Who, Thomas Raymond loves fishing.

02:30.583 --> 02:31.641
I hate fishing.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.820
It's catching fish I love.

02:35.188 --> 02:37.486
This is five or ten pounds,
I can tell.

02:37.557 --> 02:40.856
Are you getting this, huh?
Recording this for posterity?

02:42.061 --> 02:44.359
Oh, I was.
I just ran out of film.

02:45.498 --> 02:48.467
That's all right
because I just lost a fish.

02:50.436 --> 02:54.167
Geophysicist, chemist,
musician, artisan.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.936
Thomas Raymond
is quite a Renaissance man.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.069
You could look a touch
impressed, Michael.

02:59.145 --> 03:03.241
Sorry, pal. Devon seemed concerned.
I guess a little bit rubbed off on me.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.866
My sensors indicate
a woman screaming, Michael.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.374
All right, let's move it.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.374
No!
Ali, run!

03:39.118 --> 03:41.245
Ali! Run!

03:41.354 --> 03:42.378
No!

03:42.555 --> 03:43.852
Run now!

03:44.457 --> 03:45.822
Please run!

03:56.169 --> 03:58.034
This is the area, Michael.

03:58.104 --> 04:00.072
Get a visual on that car,
will you?

04:31.237 --> 04:33.865
Give me a hard copy
on Hawk Man, will you, buddy?

04:40.647 --> 04:42.615
This Dr. Raymond?
Yes, it is.

04:45.652 --> 04:48.849
I'm not getting any vitals.
Double check, will you?

04:52.759 --> 04:54.386
I'm sorry, Michael.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.696
You said you recognized this.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.096
Yes, it's an antique.

05:00.166 --> 05:03.294
Used by a group of Oriental
mercenaries called Takishi.

05:03.369 --> 05:04.563
"The Hammer Hawk."

05:05.171 --> 05:07.503
Of course it's been extinct
for over 300 years.

05:07.573 --> 05:10.041
Well, I think they just
opened up a new franchise...

05:10.109 --> 05:13.510
because those guys in the canyon
definitely knew what they were doing.

05:13.946 --> 05:15.937
Anything on Hawk Face's
ID yet?

05:16.015 --> 05:18.449
I'm still accessing data,
Michael.

05:19.719 --> 05:21.016
What about the car leaving
the scene?

05:21.087 --> 05:23.021
It's registered
to Ali Raymond.

05:23.089 --> 05:24.818
Dr. Raymond's daughter?
Yes.

05:24.891 --> 05:27.758
Then access her address. Maybe
she can fill in some blank spots.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.055
Right away.

05:29.128 --> 05:32.154
Oh, Michael, before you go,
there's someone I want you to meet.

05:32.765 --> 05:34.130
Here?
Here.

05:34.367 --> 05:37.530
A very bright young chap,
a Knight Industries fellow.

05:37.770 --> 05:41.069
In fact, our board of directors feels
that one day he may be one of us.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.172
I just don't understand it.

05:52.318 --> 05:54.115
My beautiful Wedgwood service.

05:54.220 --> 05:57.747
Elliott was just trying to show
me how to brew tea by computer.

05:57.824 --> 06:00.349
Sorry. Normally,
it's mega-efficient.

06:00.426 --> 06:04.226
Precise tea-steeping time is
broken down into minute fractions.

06:04.297 --> 06:05.992
Just like the teapot.

06:06.632 --> 06:08.862
Just like the teapot.
That's funny.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.297
Hilarious.

06:12.138 --> 06:15.437
Michael Knight, allow me
to introduce Elliott Sykes.

06:16.275 --> 06:19.836
That's Elliott with two "L's" and
two "T's". Like in latitudinal.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.547
Nice to meet you.

06:22.615 --> 06:26.073
Michael, in spite of Elliott's
obvious youth...

06:26.386 --> 06:30.789
he's already an authority on Dr. Raymond's
field of nuclear magnetic resonance.

06:30.990 --> 06:34.255
And I'm sure that he will
prove a great help to us.

06:35.027 --> 06:36.460
Eventually.

06:36.796 --> 06:37.888
Right.

06:38.030 --> 06:40.328
Welcome aboard.
Wherever I can help.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.992
Rain or shine, sleet or snow...

06:42.068 --> 06:45.003
Yeah, I got you.
Thanks very much, Elliott.

06:46.305 --> 06:49.536
Smile.
One day he may be one of us.

06:56.849 --> 06:58.476
Not much to look at.

06:59.552 --> 07:02.077
Usually, when a man loses
his life over a stone...

07:02.155 --> 07:03.918
it's for a diamond or a ruby.

07:04.390 --> 07:08.690
This crystal has a beauty all
its own. Even if you don't see it.

07:09.529 --> 07:11.656
Ever hear of a thermal laser?

07:12.365 --> 07:14.765
Sound like
a high-rent sun lamp.

07:15.234 --> 07:17.099
You're a real genius, Mac.

07:17.603 --> 07:21.061
Look, lasers focus light.
Thermal lasers focus heat.

07:21.140 --> 07:24.507
That was Dr. Raymond's great
discovery, his life's work.

07:24.911 --> 07:27.778
And that's what this
baby's for? You got it.

07:27.847 --> 07:29.576
But Raymond got paranoid.

07:29.649 --> 07:33.085
He worried about it falling
into the wrong hands.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.188
So this is gonna cut us
into the diamond vault, huh?

07:37.256 --> 07:39.315
Like a hot knife
through butter.

07:39.392 --> 07:40.757
Watch this.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.528
That's it?

08:25.338 --> 08:27.772
I could do more damage
with my bare hands.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.307
Something's wrong.

08:29.375 --> 08:31.843
You're damn right
something's wrong.

08:31.911 --> 08:33.879
We're hitting that
vault tomorrow.

08:33.946 --> 08:36.779
And I killed a man over this Buck
Rogers gizmo that doesn't work.

08:36.849 --> 08:40.250
It works. It worked for Raymond,
and it'll work for me. I promise you.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.511
This crystal's been
cut in two.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.654
That's all there was.
That's it.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.727
That old fox.

08:49.996 --> 08:51.588
I underestimated him.

08:52.632 --> 08:54.327
He's hidden
the other half, Mac.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.301
And I want you to find it.
I don't care what it takes.

09:31.370 --> 09:32.860
Michael, this Elliott Sykes...

09:32.939 --> 09:35.066
has quite an impressive
academic record.

09:35.141 --> 09:37.041
You don't say.
Yes, I do.

09:37.109 --> 09:39.304
He was the youngest student
ever to enter Caltech...

09:39.378 --> 09:41.243
graduating magna cum laude.

09:41.314 --> 09:44.181
Not to mention earning a Phi
Beta Kappa Key along the way.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.377
Oh, you're right.
That's quite impressive.

09:46.452 --> 09:49.387
But there is one piece of information
that keeps appearing, Michael...

09:49.455 --> 09:50.683
that I don't quite understand.

09:50.756 --> 09:51.848
What's that, buddy?

09:51.924 --> 09:54.757
In several interviews,
he's referred to as a nerd.

09:54.827 --> 09:56.089
What does that mean?

09:57.897 --> 09:59.489
Well, a nerd is...

10:00.433 --> 10:04.199
A nerd is kind of
a term of affection.

10:04.503 --> 10:06.767
It sounds more like
an affliction.

10:07.039 --> 10:10.236
Well, you might just
have a point there, buddy.

10:31.764 --> 10:34.961
I'm sorry, I'm really not
open for business today.

10:35.201 --> 10:38.295
My name is Michael Knight.
I'm with The Foundation.

10:40.573 --> 10:43.633
I was the one who was coming
to see your father yesterday.

10:54.220 --> 10:55.983
Keeping busy helps.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.821
You see, I know.

10:59.191 --> 11:00.920
When my dad died...

11:01.694 --> 11:04.663
I went out and shot baskets
for five hours straight.

11:06.198 --> 11:10.862
When I finished, I was too tired
to think, or feel, or anything.

11:12.471 --> 11:14.098
At least for a little while.

11:15.608 --> 11:18.168
When the men attacked,
he told me to run.

11:18.611 --> 11:21.478
I feel like such a coward.
Hey, hey.

11:21.914 --> 11:23.745
You are not a coward.

11:24.450 --> 11:26.680
He just didn't want
to see you hurt.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.514
Thanks.

11:31.057 --> 11:33.423
Oh, listen,
I could use some coffee.

11:33.726 --> 11:36.354
You want some?
I'd love some. Thanks.

11:38.664 --> 11:41.155
Your father called
The Foundation for some help.

11:41.233 --> 11:42.928
Do you have any idea why?

11:44.003 --> 11:45.061
No.

11:48.808 --> 11:51.174
All I know is something
was bothering him...

11:51.243 --> 11:53.677
ever since a woman dropped by
to see him last week.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.609
Some kind of old romance?

11:58.317 --> 11:59.784
He wouldn't say.

12:00.686 --> 12:03.712
You have any idea what
your father was working on?

12:04.890 --> 12:05.914
No.

12:06.258 --> 12:08.852
He was always very secretive
about his work.

12:09.428 --> 12:11.020
But he was taking
some time off.

12:11.097 --> 12:14.555
Really all he was working on
was his fishing...

12:15.201 --> 12:17.726
playing the electric guitar,
making jewelry.

12:18.437 --> 12:20.564
Michael, I've just
identified Hawk Face.

12:20.639 --> 12:22.607
He's custodian
of a temple downtown.

12:22.675 --> 12:24.438
Terrific, I'm on my way.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.204
Standard Foundation equipment?

12:26.278 --> 12:28.906
Yeah, this little gadget
comes with the job.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.982
Are you sure you're gonna be
all right by yourself?

12:34.754 --> 12:37.314
I won't be all right until I
find out who killed my father.

12:37.389 --> 12:38.947
That's why I'm here.

12:39.892 --> 12:42.292
Now you hang in there.
I'll be in touch, okay?

13:12.958 --> 13:14.653
His name is Fuji Hakito.

13:14.727 --> 13:17.753
Given he's a Takishi,
might I suggest caution?

13:17.830 --> 13:20.264
My middle name, partner,
my middle name.

13:22.501 --> 13:23.593
Sayonara.

14:24.997 --> 14:26.692
All right, call Devon.

14:26.966 --> 14:29.526
Have him notify the police
to pick up Hakito...

14:30.369 --> 14:31.802
and little his friend here.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.361
Right away, Michael.

14:46.952 --> 14:48.112
How's
the interrogation coming?

14:48.187 --> 14:50.587
Well, according
to Sgt. Paul, it's not.

14:50.656 --> 14:53.682
This is an absolutely ghastly
way to serve tea, isn't it?

14:53.759 --> 14:55.886
By the way, have you
ever heard of "sei-jo"?

14:55.961 --> 14:57.121
"Sei-jo"?

14:57.830 --> 15:00.856
Sounds like something from a
sushi bar. We should be so lucky.

15:00.933 --> 15:04.835
Apparently it's the Takishi version
of omerta, the vow of silence.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.168
The vow of silence.
Oh, that's terrific.

15:08.040 --> 15:12.875
We got an ancient warrior clan here
alive and well and living high on the hog.

15:13.178 --> 15:15.669
I had KITT check out
Hakito's piggy banks.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.876
This guy has got more in CDs
than you make in one year.

15:18.951 --> 15:22.318
If you're suggesting I should change
my occupation, I'm not interested.

15:23.289 --> 15:25.553
There must be more to this
than meets the eye.

15:25.624 --> 15:27.854
I agree.
The question is what?

15:28.827 --> 15:31.057
You're right,
this tea is ghastly.

15:32.164 --> 15:33.324
The way it works...

15:33.399 --> 15:35.230
is by reorganizing
particles of light...

15:35.301 --> 15:37.701
into their most
efficient matrix.

15:38.170 --> 15:40.070
I couldn't have said it
better myself.

15:40.139 --> 15:42.801
Elliott is going to demonstrate
Dr. Raymond's principle...

15:42.875 --> 15:44.638
of split-particle radiation.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.905
It's not all that
complicated, really.

15:47.012 --> 15:50.914
The light we see is only one percent
of the total available spectrum.

15:53.619 --> 15:54.779
Watch.

15:56.689 --> 16:00.489
This convex focal lens was one of
Dr. Raymond's early innovations.

16:01.093 --> 16:03.687
The smoke crystal,
as it's sometimes called...

16:03.762 --> 16:07.289
has the ability to increase
light penetration 100-fold.

16:10.369 --> 16:12.064
My cricket trophy.

16:14.773 --> 16:19.210
We won the cricket championship
that year. I've had this for decades.

16:19.278 --> 16:22.179
Gee, what decade was that?

16:22.982 --> 16:24.279
Never mind.

16:25.150 --> 16:28.608
Ah, well, we are having so much
fun that I really hate to leave.

16:29.188 --> 16:32.419
But I got to check out a little place
called Mac Gifford's Body Boutique.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.356
It turns out Hakito
taught there.

16:35.594 --> 16:38.427
Oh, yeah,
by the way, if Ali calls...

16:39.164 --> 16:41.098
tell her I'm gonna stop
by this afternoon.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.499
I want to keep an eye on her till
I get a fix on what's involved here.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.367
Oh, yeah, and, Devon...

16:46.438 --> 16:50.306
on the way I'll keep an eye
out for a trophy repair shop.

17:13.265 --> 17:15.165
Michael, there's one thing
about Elliott...

17:15.233 --> 17:16.428
I don't understand.

17:16.502 --> 17:17.526
What's that?

17:17.603 --> 17:20.696
Assuming one couldn't prefer
being called a nerd...

17:20.772 --> 17:22.434
why does he act like one?

17:23.909 --> 17:25.934
I don't think he's acting.

17:26.811 --> 17:30.771
I'll be right back. Meanwhile, get me
everything you can on this Mac Gifford.

17:30.849 --> 17:32.180
Certainly, Michael.

17:33.919 --> 17:36.387
Now tell me
that doesn't feel good.

17:36.455 --> 17:38.286
The only thing that's gonna
make me feel good...

17:38.357 --> 17:41.053
is to find the other half
of that black crystal.

17:41.126 --> 17:44.562
If Raymond's daughter doesn't
have it, she'll know where it is.

17:44.863 --> 17:47.024
Either way,
we're gonna find it.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.194
Now relax.

17:51.370 --> 17:52.530
That's it.

17:52.871 --> 17:56.671
Now visualize all the tension
leaving your body.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.638
But I... I love you, Sheila.

18:03.315 --> 18:04.748
Love? What do you know
about love?

18:04.817 --> 18:05.909
Excuse me?

18:05.984 --> 18:07.542
You here for aerobics?

18:07.886 --> 18:10.218
Only if you'll give
private lessons.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.316
Sorry to disappoint you...

18:17.196 --> 18:18.686
I'm just the receptionist.

18:18.964 --> 18:20.829
Well, that's even better.

18:21.467 --> 18:24.925
Maybe you can tell me about
your martial arts instructors.

18:25.003 --> 18:27.699
In particular a man
by the name of Hakito.

18:28.140 --> 18:31.132
Sorry. Mr. Gifford handles
those things personally.

18:31.543 --> 18:32.874
Mr. Gifford.

18:38.150 --> 18:39.674
Is he in there?

18:39.818 --> 18:42.582
Yes, but that's only
for Karate Club members.

18:42.654 --> 18:44.588
Black belts.
Black belts.

18:45.824 --> 18:48.486
Good. Then you
can't stop me.

18:51.997 --> 18:54.397
I gotta make that call.
I'll be right back.

19:09.915 --> 19:11.405
That was fast.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.457
I never thought
you could be so tender.

19:20.893 --> 19:25.728
Careful. I'm beginning to visualize
more than tension leaving my body.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.031
I can't wait to return
the favor.

19:31.069 --> 19:32.400
Me, neither.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.397
Hey.

19:35.874 --> 19:38.843
What do you think you're
doing? Relieving tension.

19:40.579 --> 19:43.343
My name is Michael Knight.
I'm a friend of Fuji Hakito's.

19:43.415 --> 19:44.507
Yeah?

19:44.983 --> 19:46.974
Well, then you should know
he's not here.

19:47.052 --> 19:50.488
I do. That's why I am.
Used to work out with him.

19:50.556 --> 19:53.024
I'm looking for a new
martial arts club to join.

19:54.326 --> 19:55.884
Well, this is private.

19:56.862 --> 20:00.457
But just out of curiosity,
what belt are you?

20:00.966 --> 20:03.992
Ah, put it this way,
I've beaten a Takishi.

20:04.236 --> 20:05.760
A Hammer Hawk?

20:06.038 --> 20:08.734
To my knowledge,
they died out years ago.

20:09.141 --> 20:10.836
And from what I've heard...

20:10.909 --> 20:13.139
bragging wasn't part
of the Takishi code.

20:13.545 --> 20:17.777
They had to withstand a test of
raw nerves to even be considered.

20:20.285 --> 20:21.445
Try me.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.950
You know, the Takishi believed
that the superior warrior...

20:28.360 --> 20:31.261
could look in the eyes
of death five times...

20:31.997 --> 20:33.430
and never waver.

20:33.865 --> 20:35.765
Five's my lucky number.

20:46.778 --> 20:49.303
Had enough?
Just getting warmed up.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.391
Four down.

21:04.596 --> 21:05.961
One to go.

21:13.805 --> 21:17.263
And for the last,
you must close your eyes.

21:17.809 --> 21:22.007
According to the Takishi code, that
would scare away all pretenders.

21:22.581 --> 21:25.846
For someone who just claimed
the Takishi had died out...

21:26.351 --> 21:29.514
you're sure doing your best
to keep the tradition alive.

21:29.721 --> 21:31.154
You can always quit.

21:44.236 --> 21:46.602
KITT?
Michael, watch out.

21:46.672 --> 21:49.038
His vital signs
are increasing rapidly.

22:11.196 --> 22:12.527
You moved.

22:12.831 --> 22:15.425
You should have told me the
Takishis had a height requirement.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.661
Don't get the wrong idea,
Knight.

22:17.736 --> 22:20.000
You bailed out first
and my man adjusted.

22:20.072 --> 22:21.630
Yeah, right.

22:22.274 --> 22:24.435
We'll try it again
some time, huh?

22:25.110 --> 22:26.441
In my gym.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.655
He could be trouble.

22:37.923 --> 22:40.653
Wrong tense, Mac.
He is trouble.

22:41.493 --> 22:42.687
Thanks.

22:43.261 --> 22:45.161
Why, that Mac has
all the luck, huh?

22:45.364 --> 22:47.924
That Angel Brown,
she's almost as pretty as you.

22:49.101 --> 22:51.968
Angel Brown?
You must mean Vanessa Sutton.

22:52.504 --> 22:55.667
Vanessa Sutton. I must have
been thinking of her eyes.

22:55.741 --> 22:57.299
I'll catch you later.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.604
You do that.

23:10.655 --> 23:14.352
We're on a roll, partner.
This place is Takishi Central.

23:14.593 --> 23:17.653
And this guy Gifford is in it
up to his shurikens.

23:17.729 --> 23:20.721
That's odd, Michael.
He's a very respectable man.

23:20.799 --> 23:25.133
Decorated Green Beret, karate champion.
And this club is very successful.

23:25.203 --> 23:27.433
Why would he risk it?
I don't know.

23:27.506 --> 23:29.133
But if I'm any judge
of manhood...

23:29.207 --> 23:32.665
it has something to do with a
beautiful lady named Vanessa Sutton.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.713
See what you've got on her,
will you?

23:35.781 --> 23:37.043
Right away, Michael.

23:49.694 --> 23:51.355
I've completed the check,
Michael.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.194
There are 11 Vanessa Suttons
in my data bank.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.824
Run them by me, buddy.

23:56.735 --> 23:58.293
Vanessa Abigail Sutton.

23:58.370 --> 24:00.531
KITT, she's 90 years old.
Go on.

24:00.605 --> 24:01.799
Very well.

24:03.508 --> 24:04.941
Vanessa B. Sutton.

24:05.510 --> 24:07.307
Great legs, but I pass.

24:08.980 --> 24:10.572
Vanessa Mary Sutton.

24:10.649 --> 24:13.846
Ah, there's little
Miss Massage.

24:13.919 --> 24:17.821
Intelligent as well as beautiful,
Michael. She has a Ph. D. in geophysics.

24:17.989 --> 24:19.854
Just like Dr. Raymond.

24:20.625 --> 24:24.891
Let's head over to Ali's and see if
that's the woman who visited her father.

24:49.855 --> 24:51.288
Who are you?
Me?

24:51.356 --> 24:52.687
You.
Me?

24:52.891 --> 24:55.860
Yes. I'm Elliott Sykes.

24:56.695 --> 24:58.788
I work with The Foundation.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.990
The Foundation? The Foundation
for Law and Government?

25:03.368 --> 25:06.303
Yes. Michael and I are
on the case together.

25:06.671 --> 25:10.232
What were you doing creeping around here
like that? I almost took your head off.

25:10.308 --> 25:13.505
I'm sorry, I just didn't want to
disturb you in case you were working.

25:13.578 --> 25:16.570
See, Michael's concerned
about you...

25:16.648 --> 25:19.116
and I just thought
I'd drop by and...

25:20.185 --> 25:23.848
I was just trying to be
considerate. I guess I overdid it.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.687
It's all right.
No, it's not.

25:25.757 --> 25:28.487
I'm always doing nerdy things
like that.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.589
I've really got to stop.

25:30.962 --> 25:33.430
Hey, don't be
so hard on yourself.

25:35.734 --> 25:38.202
How were you to know
I'd be so jumpy?

25:39.704 --> 25:41.672
Thanks for letting me
off the hook.

25:41.907 --> 25:44.375
Listen, I'd invite you in, but
I'm already late for a shoot.

25:44.442 --> 25:46.171
I perfectly understand.

25:46.244 --> 25:49.236
Michael confided you were trying
to keep as busy as possible.

25:49.314 --> 25:52.579
However, I was hoping I could
get your father's notes...

25:52.651 --> 25:56.178
letters, anything that might give
us a clue to what he was working on.

25:56.254 --> 25:58.722
I thought maybe
we could brainstorm.

25:58.790 --> 26:00.951
Well, how about I let you
go through his things...

26:01.026 --> 26:03.517
so then, by the time you're
finished, I'll be back...

26:03.595 --> 26:05.495
and we can brainstorm then.

26:05.864 --> 26:07.331
We can?

26:07.699 --> 26:10.065
Hey, that's a nice shirt.
Is that new?

26:10.135 --> 26:12.228
No, I wear it all the time.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.200
You do?

26:16.541 --> 26:17.735
You got me.

26:25.350 --> 26:27.477
Don't worry,
I'll handle this. Back!

26:27.719 --> 26:28.743
Back!

26:30.055 --> 26:31.488
Back, I'm warning you.

26:36.895 --> 26:38.658
You'll never get away
with this.

26:39.097 --> 26:42.157
Don't worry, Ali.
I'm a Foundation man.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.766
We never sleep.
We never eat.

26:45.604 --> 26:46.901
Put her in the back.

26:49.674 --> 26:51.505
I got them! I got them!

26:52.243 --> 26:53.232
Oh, no!

26:56.781 --> 26:57.873
Ali!

27:06.458 --> 27:08.790
Michael! Michael!

27:09.561 --> 27:12.962
It's Ali! They've got her!
She's in that four-wheeler!

27:17.669 --> 27:19.500
KITT, pick them up
on your scanner...

27:19.571 --> 27:20.629
and get me a map overlay.

27:20.705 --> 27:22.036
Right away, Michael.

28:22.734 --> 28:24.099
He's closing on us.

28:26.571 --> 28:27.799
Use the gun.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.464
But it's not
calibrated yet.

28:29.607 --> 28:31.666
Use it! Aim it at the tires!

28:44.823 --> 28:46.017
Okay, go!

28:51.429 --> 28:52.828
I'm sorry, Michael...

28:52.897 --> 28:54.558
but they've disabled
my right front tire.

28:54.632 --> 28:56.930
I've never experienced
anything like it.

29:17.956 --> 29:20.390
I hope they don't
hurt Ali, Michael.

29:20.658 --> 29:24.822
Let's just hope they consider her
insurance until they get what they're after.

29:24.896 --> 29:26.830
You've no hint
of what that might be?

29:26.898 --> 29:30.163
No, I don't. But whatever it
is, it's worth killing for.

29:30.235 --> 29:31.827
It's all my fault.

29:32.237 --> 29:34.728
I could have stopped that guy
from taking Ali.

29:36.141 --> 29:37.369
Elliott...

29:37.942 --> 29:41.207
you did your best. Sometimes,
it takes a lot more than heart.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.440
Yeah, it takes
strength and courage.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.506
The two things I can
never put on my resume.

29:45.583 --> 29:47.813
Yeah, you were just
a little bit overmatched.

29:48.186 --> 29:49.983
I wish I had
the same excuse.

29:50.088 --> 29:51.749
Believe me,
you do, Michael.

29:51.823 --> 29:55.589
That beam melted poor KITT's tire
like it was a piece of ordinary rubber.

29:55.660 --> 29:57.628
Yes, and it was
most embarrassing.

29:57.695 --> 29:59.287
Yeah, we'll get them
next time, buddy.

29:59.364 --> 30:00.797
Don't be too sure.

30:00.865 --> 30:04.926
Thanks to Dr. Raymond's diaries, we
know he developed the black crystal.

30:05.003 --> 30:06.129
They've got it.

30:06.204 --> 30:08.035
Yes, that's
the frightening part.

30:08.106 --> 30:12.372
There's no earthly material that the
new split-particle beam can't melt down.

30:12.443 --> 30:14.877
If you're trying to scare me
off, Devon, forget it.

30:14.946 --> 30:18.473
Right now, I got to find Ali, and
I got a good idea where to start.

30:18.783 --> 30:19.909
Bonnie?

30:20.518 --> 30:23.078
KITT's ready.
I want to go with you.

30:23.588 --> 30:24.850
For Ali's sake.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.218
You really like her,
don't you?

30:27.292 --> 30:28.782
Well, sure.

30:29.527 --> 30:32.621
You gotta aim high,
reach for the top.

30:32.864 --> 30:35.162
Even if you end up
with a nosebleed.

30:36.301 --> 30:40.169
All right, then, for her sake, you stay here,
you put your head together with Bonnie...

30:40.238 --> 30:43.605
and try and figure out a way that's
gonna give KITT and me a fighting chance.

30:43.675 --> 30:44.937
Okay, pal?

30:45.276 --> 30:46.334
Pal?

30:47.078 --> 30:48.545
You mean that?

30:49.814 --> 30:51.372
With a capital "P."

30:54.652 --> 30:56.381
Good luck, Michael.

31:13.404 --> 31:15.872
Hello? No, I'm sorry,
he just left.

31:16.941 --> 31:19.136
Just a minute. Devon,
it's about Ali.

31:19.444 --> 31:21.105
Tape it and trace it.

31:23.481 --> 31:24.641
Hello?

31:24.716 --> 31:27.617
Don't waste time on a trace,
Miles. We won't be long.

31:27.685 --> 31:28.709
Who is this?

31:28.786 --> 31:30.151
Gifford?
Never mind.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.887
If Knight wants Ali Raymond,
he can have her back.

31:32.957 --> 31:35.824
We'll release her in the Mars
Canyon area sometime this afternoon.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.759
She's given us all we need.

31:39.864 --> 31:43.766
Don't be ridiculous. We know
who you are. You must give it up.

31:43.835 --> 31:45.996
Save it.
And you send Knight alone.

31:46.204 --> 31:50.231
If we see any police with him, you'll
scrape her off the canyon rocks.

31:52.810 --> 31:53.970
You got it?

31:54.045 --> 31:56.036
That canyon is
a very large area.

31:56.114 --> 31:57.604
Now where exactly...

31:57.982 --> 32:00.314
No. I almost had it
when they hung up.

32:01.419 --> 32:02.477
Damn.

32:04.856 --> 32:06.517
He swallowed the bait.

32:07.058 --> 32:08.218
Perfect.

32:08.393 --> 32:11.385
One last dry run.
Let's go test it out.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.900
What do you expect to find
at Gifford's gym?

32:20.972 --> 32:23.304
Gifford's a hotdog.
A hotdog?

32:23.374 --> 32:26.343
Yeah, he's a hotdog. He
does everything in a big way.

32:26.444 --> 32:28.605
Guys like that
are always sloppy.

32:28.680 --> 32:31.274
So you think he left something
that will lead us to Ali?

32:31.349 --> 32:32.816
My money's on it.

32:33.217 --> 32:35.412
Michael, we have an emergency
on our hands.

32:35.486 --> 32:36.919
We just had a call
from Gifford.

32:36.988 --> 32:39.513
Let me guess, $100,000, huh?
$200,000?

32:39.590 --> 32:43.082
No. What they really
want, Michael, is you. Me?

32:43.161 --> 32:46.961
Yes. They insist that they
will only release Ali to you.

32:47.065 --> 32:48.862
That's a trap.
I'm sure of it.

32:49.500 --> 32:52.025
That's why I want you back
here right away.

32:52.170 --> 32:56.334
We'll order a police aerial surveillance
over Mars Canyon, and when they come out...

32:56.407 --> 32:57.806
No way. I'm going
after her, Devon.

32:57.875 --> 33:00.036
Against the thermal laser?
It's suicide.

33:00.111 --> 33:04.047
Now, Bonnie and Elliott are close to
completing an insulating solution for KITT.

33:04.115 --> 33:06.515
But without that...
Devon, they will kill her.

33:06.584 --> 33:08.950
If the police helicopters
stay high enough...

33:09.020 --> 33:12.786
Devon, read my lips. They will
kill her. Now, I'm going after her.

33:12.857 --> 33:14.051
You can't, Michael, you can't!

33:14.125 --> 33:17.583
Look, if I go in there with KITT, there's
a good chance I can get her out alive.

33:17.662 --> 33:21.325
Now, if I don't show, you can write her
off just like her father. That's guaranteed.

33:21.399 --> 33:23.629
Michael, don't do it.
Don't do it, please.

33:23.701 --> 33:26.761
What's that? Devon,
you're fading on me.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.669
Listen to reason, don't do it!

33:28.740 --> 33:31.300
Oh, no. Transmission's
going bad here.

33:31.409 --> 33:34.640
I can't hear you, I'll have to talk
to you later. You wish me luck, huh?

33:36.714 --> 33:38.443
Good luck, Michael.

33:38.716 --> 33:40.547
Elliott.
Elliott.

33:41.152 --> 33:43.643
Elliott, what are you doing?
You'll kill yourself.

34:01.072 --> 34:02.835
This is Mars Canyon, Michael.

34:03.908 --> 34:05.773
All right, silent mode, pal.

34:09.013 --> 34:11.572
This is where Gifford's boy
said they'd...

34:11.716 --> 34:12.944
Hold it.

34:13.851 --> 34:16.376
All right, scan the van.
Let's see what's inside.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.621
The van's frame is reinforced
with lead, Michael.

34:22.693 --> 34:24.422
My scanner can't penetrate it.

34:24.629 --> 34:26.893
All right, you stay here. I'm
going to take a closer look.

34:26.964 --> 34:28.556
But, Michael...

34:28.833 --> 34:31.802
If Ali's inside and they see
us, they may hurt her.

34:32.437 --> 34:34.166
I'll have a better chance
sneaking up alone.

34:34.237 --> 34:36.638
All right, but if there is
any trouble, you let me know.

34:36.706 --> 34:39.107
Believe me,
you'll be the first to know.

35:07.138 --> 35:08.696
Here he comes, Mac.

35:14.412 --> 35:15.970
Michael, to your right.

35:27.925 --> 35:29.153
Elliott!

35:34.899 --> 35:35.991
Ali.

35:36.067 --> 35:37.762
Hey, hey,
what're you doing?

35:38.202 --> 35:39.533
Get in there!

35:46.277 --> 35:48.336
KITT, I need your help, buddy.

35:50.715 --> 35:52.012
I'm on my way.

36:06.464 --> 36:08.261
There goes
our last hurdle, Mac.

36:13.237 --> 36:15.102
The cops. I don't believe it.

36:15.439 --> 36:16.929
Get us out of here.

36:27.151 --> 36:29.449
Michael? Michael?
Are you okay?

36:38.496 --> 36:39.656
I'm all right.

36:39.764 --> 36:43.461
KITT? KITT?
Michael? Michael.

36:47.305 --> 36:48.397
I'm all right.

36:48.472 --> 36:50.303
We've got to get you
to a hospital.

36:51.275 --> 36:55.109
They got Ali and Elliott. The
hospital will have to wait, pal.

37:18.636 --> 37:20.900
Bonnie,
how much extra protection...

37:20.972 --> 37:24.271
is this thermal absorption
layer going to give us anyway?

37:24.442 --> 37:27.411
Ten seconds, Michael.
No more, no less.

37:28.012 --> 37:30.606
Ten seconds? That's
not a whole lot, is it?

37:31.215 --> 37:34.048
Well, let's just say
it's better than nothing.

37:34.518 --> 37:37.351
Considering the power
of Dr. Raymond's crystal...

37:37.421 --> 37:39.787
you're lucky to be here
with us at all.

37:40.691 --> 37:42.124
We're lucky, too.

37:43.227 --> 37:44.694
Thanks, Devon.

37:44.996 --> 37:47.556
Everybody's lucky
but Elliott and Ali.

37:48.532 --> 37:50.898
I feel like we're going
backwards here.

37:51.302 --> 37:53.862
Did you find anything
in Dr. Raymond's diaries?

37:53.938 --> 37:55.166
Oh, yes.

37:55.539 --> 37:58.599
You were right about her visiting
him shortly before his murder.

37:59.076 --> 38:00.771
Now look here, Michael.

38:01.078 --> 38:02.511
There's something
you didn't know.

38:02.580 --> 38:05.879
Vanessa Sutton was his assistant
on the black crystal project.

38:06.017 --> 38:08.247
No kidding.
That explains a lot.

38:08.319 --> 38:11.686
Look here. An address
with V.M.S. alongside it.

38:13.024 --> 38:14.252
Vanessa Mary Sutton.

38:14.325 --> 38:16.418
Only, as you see,
it's dated two years ago.

38:16.494 --> 38:18.724
Look, I'll bet her house
was under a different name.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.696
That's why we haven't
been able to locate her.

38:20.765 --> 38:22.232
I'm sure that's right.
Thanks, Devon.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.029
Bonnie, KITT ready?

38:25.136 --> 38:27.229
If I said no,
would you leave him here?

38:28.339 --> 38:29.704
Absolutely.

38:31.842 --> 38:33.503
Michael, remember...

38:34.178 --> 38:35.509
ten seconds.

38:35.646 --> 38:38.114
Don't worry,
I'm sure KITT will remind me.

38:40.751 --> 38:43.117
That, Michael,
is one thing you can count on.

39:03.641 --> 39:06.439
You ready? Let's go over
the plan one more time.

39:10.414 --> 39:12.905
Ali, I think
I'm getting somewhere.

39:17.455 --> 39:19.582
That's my pocket, Elliott.

39:19.790 --> 39:20.916
Sorry.

39:21.125 --> 39:22.786
I just can't see.

39:23.227 --> 39:25.161
Here, give me the glass.
Let me try.

39:28.499 --> 39:30.126
This is hopeless.

39:30.201 --> 39:31.759
Don't give up, Ali.

39:32.303 --> 39:34.134
At least we're
in this together.

39:34.638 --> 39:36.629
Yeah, I'm glad, really.

39:37.808 --> 39:40.106
I just wish it was under
different circumstances.

39:40.311 --> 39:41.505
You do?

39:42.480 --> 39:44.209
You mean I don't
turn you off?

39:44.281 --> 39:46.181
I know I'm not much
to look at, but...

39:46.250 --> 39:48.980
Elliott, listen,
you've got a beautiful heart.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.014
And a beautiful mind.

39:51.655 --> 39:55.022
I'm a photographer, I know. You
can't always see that with your eye...

39:55.092 --> 39:57.151
but it always shows up
in the picture.

39:57.228 --> 39:58.320
Boy...

39:59.196 --> 40:02.188
if I could just find out
what they were up to, maybe...

40:04.235 --> 40:05.725
Wait a minute.

40:06.437 --> 40:08.029
Ali, bounce with me.

40:08.105 --> 40:09.299
Bounce?

40:15.312 --> 40:17.109
According
to my calculations...

40:22.453 --> 40:25.217
There aren't any questions?
Let's get to the diamond exchange.

40:25.456 --> 40:27.549
I'm going to check
on those kids first.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.659
Hey, I got it!
Shh.

40:30.728 --> 40:32.025
I got it. I got it.

40:32.129 --> 40:33.323
Don't hurt them.

40:33.397 --> 40:36.161
If something goes wrong, they
could be our ace in the hole.

40:46.043 --> 40:48.170
Elliott, that was beautiful!

40:49.146 --> 40:51.205
You kissed me.
Let's get out of here.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.250
You kissed me.
Come on.

41:19.810 --> 41:22.472
Computerized ignition.
Will you just go?

41:30.488 --> 41:32.581
Mac! What happened?

41:32.656 --> 41:35.853
What do you think happened? They
got away. I'm going after them.

41:35.926 --> 41:39.418
Mac, no. In a half hour the diamond
exchange will be swarming with people.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.055
Now, come on, let's go.

41:49.473 --> 41:51.304
KITT.
I see them, Michael.

42:14.465 --> 42:15.932
What happened? Are you okay?

42:16.000 --> 42:18.127
We're okay now,
thanks to Elliott.

42:18.536 --> 42:19.833
Where's Vanessa
and Gifford?

42:19.904 --> 42:23.101
After diamonds. I heard them
say something about an exchange.

42:23.173 --> 42:25.141
The diamond exchange downtown,
Michael.

42:25.209 --> 42:27.769
All right, that fits. Elliott,
you take Ali to safety.

42:27.845 --> 42:30.678
I'm coming with you.
I'm a Foundation man, too.

42:31.048 --> 42:33.039
Elliott, come here. Come here.

42:35.352 --> 42:38.287
Elliott,
a real Foundation man...

42:38.589 --> 42:40.921
would never leave
a lady in danger alone.

42:41.292 --> 42:42.452
You're right.

42:42.927 --> 42:44.554
Okay, but call
if you need me.

42:44.628 --> 42:46.562
You got my word on it.

43:30.240 --> 43:32.140
Did you take care
of the security guard?

43:32.209 --> 43:33.972
Don't worry,
he won't give us any problem.

43:34.044 --> 43:36.308
All right, then let's get over there.
Hold it.

43:36.780 --> 43:38.338
I don't believe it.

43:45.456 --> 43:47.481
What do we have to do
to get rid of that guy?

43:47.558 --> 43:48.650
This.

43:55.499 --> 43:56.830
Should we get closer?

43:56.900 --> 43:58.299
No, no, let's stay right here.

43:58.369 --> 44:00.803
This time
it's at 100 % capacity.

44:01.705 --> 44:03.730
Michael,
she's getting ready to fire.

44:03.841 --> 44:05.968
All right, set your timer.

44:07.678 --> 44:09.543
Remember, Michael...
I know.

44:09.947 --> 44:11.312
Ten seconds.

44:23.827 --> 44:25.260
He's heading straight for us.

44:26.196 --> 44:27.390
He'll never make it.

44:27.464 --> 44:30.763
No? Well, he's doing a damn good
job of it. Something's wrong.

44:32.670 --> 44:33.864
Michael, we're burning up.

44:33.937 --> 44:35.734
How long?
Five, Michael.

44:36.707 --> 44:38.572
Let's bail out of here.
Right.

44:40.411 --> 44:43.608
Less than two seconds
and we incinerate. One second.

44:47.317 --> 44:49.342
They're out, buddy.
Let's hit the gun.

44:58.929 --> 45:00.692
I'll get Gifford.
You get the others.

45:43.407 --> 45:44.772
Nice going, buddy.

45:45.943 --> 45:48.605
Now you guys are going
to feel some real heat.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.008
Right, KITT?

46:02.326 --> 46:03.588
What do you think?

46:03.794 --> 46:05.056
I like it.

46:05.129 --> 46:07.290
She likes it.
Right on.

46:13.470 --> 46:15.734
You know, when all the pros
and cons are weighed...

46:15.806 --> 46:19.071
I may have no choice, but to give
Elliott a positive evaluation.

46:19.143 --> 46:20.667
I think that's very fair.

46:20.744 --> 46:25.408
Of course, a recommendation may cause
the board to inflict him on us again.

46:25.849 --> 46:27.111
Huh?
Anytime.

46:28.652 --> 46:29.846
Really?

46:31.288 --> 46:32.653
Come on, Michael.

46:32.723 --> 46:35.248
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

46:35.325 --> 46:38.055
I think this whole experience
has changed him.

46:38.228 --> 46:40.128
It has?
Some.

46:47.604 --> 46:49.902
Ah, care to try your luck,
Michael?

46:50.040 --> 46:51.701
Sure, I'm pretty lucky.

46:51.775 --> 46:54.437
I'm gonna go take a
ride with Elliott. Okay.

47:02.653 --> 47:05.451
Hey, KITT, you got
a little buddy over here.

47:06.723 --> 47:09.089
KITT, meet KNERD.

47:11.128 --> 47:12.288
KNERD?

47:12.396 --> 47:14.159
If you got it, flaunt it.

47:17.501 --> 47:18.866
Good grief.
