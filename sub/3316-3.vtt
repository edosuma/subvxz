00:13.493 --> 00:15.362
Help me.

00:15.430 --> 00:16.830
No!

00:22.505 --> 00:24.573
(grunting angrily)

00:24.641 --> 00:26.876

(grunts)

00:53.063 --> 00:54.371
(yelling)

01:00.637 --> 01:03.006
Come on, come on.
We gotta get out of here.

01:03.074 --> 01:04.340
We gotta get to the car.

01:04.409 --> 01:06.043
Come on, baby, get up.
(groaning)

01:06.111 --> 01:08.213
Ready?

01:08.281 --> 01:10.249
Come on. Come on.

01:10.317 --> 01:12.118
Let's go... let's go.

01:12.186 --> 01:15.389
(dials phone, line rings)

01:15.456 --> 01:16.624
WOMAN:
911, what's your emergency?

01:16.691 --> 01:17.792
TERESA:
What?

01:17.860 --> 01:19.227
Oh, no.

01:21.797 --> 01:23.064
No!

01:25.234 --> 01:27.001
911 OPERATOR:
Are those gunshots?

01:27.069 --> 01:29.070
Ma'am, what is your location?
Can you hear me?

01:29.138 --> 01:30.305
You shot 'em, man.

01:30.372 --> 01:32.140
Please answer me, ma'am...

01:34.310 --> 01:36.311
That was so sick.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.666
Shit. Sh...

01:42.875 --> 01:44.409
Did you see how they dropped?

01:44.477 --> 01:46.112
It was like a sack of potatoes.

01:46.180 --> 01:49.248
It was like bang!
Lights out!

01:49.316 --> 01:51.417
That's what you get for stabbing Joe.

01:51.485 --> 01:53.754
- This ain't funny, man.
This shit went way too far. - Come on, man.

01:53.821 --> 01:55.623
It went as far as it could go.

01:55.691 --> 01:57.382
Now don't puss out on me, Cooper!

01:57.502 --> 01:59.428
Devon... check it out.

01:59.495 --> 02:02.064
His arm's been ripped off.

02:02.132 --> 02:03.232
I mean, what the hell
could have done that?

02:04.501 --> 02:06.536

03:25.189 --> 03:28.214
("The Favre Requiem" plays,
knock at door)

03:32.535 --> 03:34.736
I have today's mail.

03:35.682 --> 03:37.649
There's a storm coming, Sister Jude.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.984
Big fat storm.

03:48.187 --> 03:50.789
Oh... Where did this come from?

03:50.857 --> 03:53.258
The mailbox.

03:53.326 --> 03:56.228
No, you ninny,
I mean who brought it here?

03:56.296 --> 03:57.429
The mailman.

04:06.427 --> 04:08.171
ANNOUNCER:
We interrupt "The Favre Requiem"

04:08.412 --> 04:09.879
to bring you a severe weather warning.

04:09.947 --> 04:11.615
There's a nor'easter storm approaching

04:11.682 --> 04:13.184
the entire Eastern seaboard.

04:13.304 --> 04:15.905
The eye of the storm
is expected to hit Friday night.

04:16.024 --> 04:18.120
Many areas have been evacuated,
but if you're still at home,

04:18.189 --> 04:20.656
fill empty containers
with clean drinking water

04:20.725 --> 04:22.326
and stay put.

04:22.394 --> 04:24.929
We'll bring you another update
within the hour.

04:27.199 --> 04:29.367
(panting)

04:36.543 --> 04:39.044
(sighs)

04:39.112 --> 04:41.146
(stifled sob)

04:42.160 --> 04:43.568
THREDSON:
Everything all right, Sister?

04:46.023 --> 04:49.812
Inclement weather
always upsets the natives.

04:49.932 --> 04:51.208
They're fragile souls.

04:51.431 --> 04:53.499
That's why you should stop
using corporal punishment.

04:53.567 --> 04:54.867
I mean, at our meeting yesterday,

04:54.934 --> 04:56.569
Mr. Walker couldn't
even sit down.

04:56.636 --> 04:58.271
I realize you're likely unfamiliar

04:58.338 --> 05:00.072
with the work of B.F. Skinner,

05:00.140 --> 05:01.640
but positive reinforcement

05:01.708 --> 05:03.442
has proven to be far more effective.

05:03.510 --> 05:04.944
In lay terms, Sister,

05:05.012 --> 05:06.679
a little compassion
would go a long way.

05:06.747 --> 05:07.913
Me?

05:07.981 --> 05:09.834
I'm a beacon of compassion.

05:10.083 --> 05:12.215
In fact, I spent all morning
on the phone

05:12.335 --> 05:13.680
with St. Angela Parish,

05:13.747 --> 05:15.648
to borrow their movie projector.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.918
I thought a movie could
distract our charges

05:17.986 --> 05:19.286
when the storm hits.

05:19.685 --> 05:21.367
I wouldn't have figured you
for a movie buff.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.925
Even I can concede
that there are a few

05:24.045 --> 05:27.661
exceptions to the usual
Hollywood dreck.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.958
The Archdiocese is loaning us a copy

05:30.070 --> 05:32.238
of <i>The Sign of the Cross.</i>
I'm impressed.

05:32.305 --> 05:36.141
And if I can help in any way,
please don't hesitate to ask.

05:36.209 --> 05:38.844
Oh... yes.

05:38.912 --> 05:40.646
As attending physician of Jed Potter,

05:40.713 --> 05:42.514
I'll need his autopsy
report for my files.

05:42.582 --> 05:44.717
I'm very busy, Doctor.

05:45.708 --> 05:48.400
But I'll try to locate it.

05:49.484 --> 05:51.691
I'll bet it says he
died of natural causes.

05:51.758 --> 05:54.260
If it's natural for
a 17-year-old boy

05:54.328 --> 05:56.829
to die of a heart attack.

05:56.897 --> 05:59.346
You have quite
a suspicious mind, Sister.

05:59.466 --> 06:01.167
Bordering on delusional.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.469
Or maybe it's just
a form of projection.

06:03.537 --> 06:05.804
A defense to protect

06:05.872 --> 06:07.505
your own guilty conscience.

06:11.176 --> 06:14.344
It was you, wasn't it?

06:14.412 --> 06:17.305
The newspaper, where did you get it?

06:19.062 --> 06:20.850
What newspaper?

06:29.526 --> 06:32.328
That office we gave you--

06:32.396 --> 06:33.696
I need it back.

06:33.764 --> 06:34.964
You've had more than enough time

06:35.031 --> 06:36.465
to advise the courts.

06:36.533 --> 06:38.467
You've got two weeks,

06:38.535 --> 06:39.702
and you're out.

06:52.282 --> 06:54.550
("Dominique" plays)

07:04.127 --> 07:06.161
(music stops)

07:06.229 --> 07:08.831
Sister Jude has asked me
to make an announcement.

07:08.898 --> 07:10.666
There's a big storm heading our way.

07:10.734 --> 07:12.601
And when it hits,

07:12.669 --> 07:15.070
half of you are going to be
too afraid to move.

07:15.138 --> 07:17.606
And other half won't
be able to stop moving.

07:17.674 --> 07:20.576
It would be chaos.
And that won't do.

07:20.644 --> 07:23.546
So, Sister Jude has
arranged for a distraction.

07:23.614 --> 07:27.083
A movie, on Friday night, when
storm will be at its worst.

07:27.151 --> 07:29.153
We're all going to be
together in the dark,

07:29.221 --> 07:31.422
watching <i>The Sign of the Cross,</i>

07:31.490 --> 07:35.993
a movie full of fire, sex,

07:36.061 --> 07:37.428
and the death of Christians.

07:38.730 --> 07:40.397
What fun.

07:47.839 --> 07:49.173
(quiet hiss)

07:53.612 --> 07:55.980
KIT:
There won't be a lockdown

07:56.047 --> 07:58.549
this Friday night if we're all
supposed to be watching a movie.

07:58.617 --> 08:00.118
We were just caught trying to escape.

08:00.186 --> 08:01.519
Which means they won't be expecting it

08:01.587 --> 08:02.654
to happen again so soon.

08:06.592 --> 08:08.860
You ruined our chance of
getting out of this place.

08:08.928 --> 08:11.529
I'd do it again, if it means I can
stop him from killing any more.

08:11.597 --> 08:14.465
Can't say I blame you. I'd have done the
same thing if I believed what you believe.

08:14.533 --> 08:16.100
But I'm innocent.
CARL: Walker.

08:16.168 --> 08:19.103
Dr. Arden wants to see you.

08:24.643 --> 08:27.144
He had lunch in his office--
tuna fish sandwich, by the way,

08:27.212 --> 08:29.647
some oatmeal cookies.
Uh, then he made a phone call

08:29.715 --> 08:31.849
to the doctor's office about,
uh, removing a mole.

08:31.917 --> 08:33.951
Was anything suspicious, Frank?
Nothing, Sister.

08:34.019 --> 08:36.386
Dr. Thredson seems like
he's on the up-and-up.

08:36.455 --> 08:38.188
Well, I'll determine that.

08:38.256 --> 08:40.491
You won't believe...
Hold your water, Sister.

08:40.558 --> 08:41.893
I'm finishing up something here.

08:41.960 --> 08:43.260
Keep watching, Frank.

08:43.328 --> 08:44.595
Assume the worst.

08:44.663 --> 08:46.898
Roger that, Sister.

08:49.635 --> 08:51.103
What are you doing?

08:51.170 --> 08:53.906
Someone's been drinking
the communion wine.

08:53.973 --> 08:55.641
I think it might be Spivey.

08:55.708 --> 08:57.876
I saw him sneaking out of the chapel.

08:57.944 --> 09:00.312
Taste it, Sister.
I'm sure it's been watered down.

09:00.380 --> 09:01.780
You know I don't imbibe.

09:01.848 --> 09:03.615
Oh, of course.
How could I forget?

09:03.683 --> 09:06.118
Since 1949, when you had a calling

09:06.185 --> 09:08.487
from Jesus Christ our Lord,

09:08.554 --> 09:10.555
which inspired you to renounce
alcohol, and turn your back on

09:10.623 --> 09:11.823
all worldly pleasures.

09:13.058 --> 09:14.725
I'll taste it.

09:16.228 --> 09:18.195
What's that on your face?

09:18.263 --> 09:20.531
On your mouth, to be exact?

09:20.599 --> 09:22.066
Mm.

09:22.133 --> 09:24.935
I might have been mistaken.

09:25.003 --> 09:27.304
It tastes rich.
Put that wine down.

09:27.372 --> 09:28.939
You look like a streetwalker.

09:29.007 --> 09:30.607
Are you wearing lipstick?

09:30.675 --> 09:32.009
Mm-hmm.

09:32.076 --> 09:33.644
It's called
"Ravish Me Red."

09:33.711 --> 09:35.845
It suits my porcelain
complexion, don't you think?

09:35.913 --> 09:39.048
Hand it over.
Oh, it's for you, actually.

09:39.116 --> 09:40.583
I hope you don't mind
that I tried it first.

09:41.718 --> 09:43.952
We don't wear makeup.

09:44.020 --> 09:45.921
Mm. And I told him that.

09:45.989 --> 09:47.489
But Dr. Arden insisted.

09:47.557 --> 09:49.824
He said, "Red is Sister Jude's
favorite color,

09:49.892 --> 09:52.193
and she'll understand just
why I want her to have it."

09:56.932 --> 09:58.633
ARDEN: Do you recognize this,
Mr. Walker?

09:58.700 --> 10:00.601
It certainly seems to recognize you.

10:00.669 --> 10:04.338
It's what came out of you
during your last visit.

10:04.406 --> 10:07.208
And so desperately
wants to get back in.

10:10.379 --> 10:12.081
What are you doing?

10:12.148 --> 10:14.450
I assume it works on some sort of

10:14.518 --> 10:16.653
magnetic principle.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.121
Have you noticed any other
lumps or protrusions?

10:18.189 --> 10:19.523
No.

10:19.590 --> 10:22.359
Who are you working for?

10:22.427 --> 10:24.194
What?

10:24.262 --> 10:25.996
Come, come, Mr. Walker.

10:26.064 --> 10:27.931
Let us not play games.

10:27.999 --> 10:31.202
This is not the first attempt
to infiltrate my labs.

10:31.270 --> 10:32.470
I don't know what
you're talking about!

10:32.538 --> 10:34.205
You were approached by someone.

10:34.273 --> 10:37.276
Someone who knew you
were being sent here.

10:37.343 --> 10:38.910
They implanted this technology in you,

10:38.978 --> 10:40.645
in order to spy on me.

10:40.713 --> 10:43.548
No, you're wrong.
Was it the Stasi?

10:43.616 --> 10:46.117
The East Germans have a particular
talent for surveillance.

10:46.185 --> 10:47.985
KGB?

10:48.821 --> 10:50.555
I understand

10:50.623 --> 10:52.958
there are even some elements
within the U.S government.

10:53.026 --> 10:54.359
Oh, yes.

10:55.728 --> 10:57.596
Jews, and fellow travelers.

10:57.664 --> 10:58.931
Who was it?

10:58.999 --> 11:00.432
It was no one.

11:00.500 --> 11:01.600
I swear.

11:03.436 --> 11:07.038
You can swear
all you like, Mr. Walker,

11:07.106 --> 11:08.873
but I will get to the truth.

11:08.941 --> 11:13.277
In here, we have all
the time in the world.

11:13.345 --> 11:15.613
(screaming)

11:28.961 --> 11:31.041
(gasps)

11:35.435 --> 11:37.703
Why are you so fearful, my child?

11:47.152 --> 11:49.120
I can't imagine
what you're so afraid of.

11:49.188 --> 11:51.689
Get on your knees
and we'll pray it all away.

11:51.757 --> 11:54.559
No... no.

12:15.613 --> 12:17.013
(woman praying in Spanish)

12:26.690 --> 12:28.525
(praying in Spanish)

12:50.616 --> 12:52.483
(wind whistles, thunder rumbles)

13:04.229 --> 13:06.597
(thunder crashes)

13:09.235 --> 13:12.571
(raspy breathing)

13:25.309 --> 13:26.810
(knocking on door)

13:26.878 --> 13:27.711
Who is it?
(door opens)

13:27.779 --> 13:29.313
(opera music playing)

13:29.381 --> 13:31.382
You wanted to see me?

13:31.450 --> 13:33.184
Little Sister.

13:33.252 --> 13:35.320
My ray of sunshine.

13:35.388 --> 13:36.521
Come in.

13:40.193 --> 13:41.493
Please.

13:43.829 --> 13:47.132
So, tell me...

13:47.200 --> 13:48.133
how are you doing?

13:48.201 --> 13:50.402
I did a feeding last night.

13:50.470 --> 13:51.770
The creatures are getting hungrier.

13:51.838 --> 13:53.571
I'm worried, Doctor.

13:53.639 --> 13:55.573
What will happen when it's freezing?

13:57.042 --> 13:58.576
And now this storm?

13:58.644 --> 14:00.545
We only have to get them
through the winter.

14:03.282 --> 14:05.117
I can't tell you
how much your compassion

14:05.184 --> 14:07.152
for these creatures means to me.

14:07.220 --> 14:09.588
Oh, please.

14:09.656 --> 14:11.090
You know you got me in here

14:11.157 --> 14:13.759
just so you can undress me
with your eyes.

14:13.827 --> 14:17.162
Imagine sucking on my rosebud tits.

14:17.230 --> 14:18.330
Don't talk like that.

14:19.532 --> 14:20.532
Come on, big boy.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.467
Show me what you got.

14:22.535 --> 14:25.036
A little bride of Christ
has had an awakening.

14:25.104 --> 14:27.772
Not to the Lord...

14:27.840 --> 14:29.474
but to the power of sex...

14:29.541 --> 14:30.508
lust...

14:30.576 --> 14:31.642
desire.

14:31.710 --> 14:32.910
Stop it.

14:32.978 --> 14:36.047
Put your mouth where you want to.

14:36.115 --> 14:37.281
Don't let it go to waste, Doc.

14:37.349 --> 14:38.916
I'm all juicy.

14:41.921 --> 14:42.920
(grunts)

14:42.988 --> 14:44.922
Shut your filthy mouth.

14:47.893 --> 14:50.361
(laughing)

14:52.298 --> 14:54.532
I didn't know you were such
a sad little pantywaist.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.967
Get out of my office!

14:56.035 --> 14:57.101
(laughs)

15:10.249 --> 15:12.618
THREDSON: A little lower
on the right there.

15:12.685 --> 15:14.420
Perfect.
Thank you, gentlemen.

15:14.487 --> 15:16.722
("Dominique" playing)

15:22.729 --> 15:24.430
Dr. Thredson?

15:24.497 --> 15:25.564
My name

15:25.632 --> 15:26.932
is Lana Winters.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.434
Can I have a word with you?

15:28.501 --> 15:30.502
In private?

15:35.107 --> 15:38.242
Would you excuse us
for a minute, please?

15:38.310 --> 15:40.845
Thank you.

15:44.116 --> 15:46.684
Miss Winters, I know a
little about your case,

15:46.752 --> 15:48.853
but I'm not authorized
to discuss your treatment.

15:48.921 --> 15:50.521
Unfortunately, I'm only

15:50.589 --> 15:52.690
officially here
to evaluate one patient.

15:52.758 --> 15:54.658
No, it's not about me.

15:54.726 --> 15:56.060
I'm going to go out on a limb here.

15:56.128 --> 15:57.762
But I've been watching you,

15:57.829 --> 15:59.163
and I know...

15:59.231 --> 16:01.098
you're not one of them.

16:01.166 --> 16:02.566
I'm desperate.

16:02.634 --> 16:04.735
I need to get a message to my friend

16:04.803 --> 16:07.505
on the outside--
Wendy Peyser

16:07.572 --> 16:10.775
Your friend-- she's the reason
why you're in here?

16:12.378 --> 16:16.348
She hasn't written or called.

16:16.415 --> 16:18.583
I know Sister Jude is
keeping her away from me.

16:18.651 --> 16:20.619
If I could just see her,

16:20.687 --> 16:23.689
I could straighten this out.

16:23.757 --> 16:25.992
Dr. Thredson...

16:26.060 --> 16:28.828
you are my last hope.

16:28.896 --> 16:30.997
Will you help me
give her this message?

16:31.065 --> 16:34.367
You're asking me
to betray Sister Jude...

16:34.435 --> 16:37.237
who is the administrator
of this sanitarium.

17:07.733 --> 17:09.733
I saw you guys conspiring upstairs.

17:09.801 --> 17:11.703
You're plotting your next escape.

17:11.771 --> 17:12.871
I don't know what
you're talking about.

17:13.873 --> 17:16.342
Are we talking to you?

17:16.409 --> 17:18.676
I can help. I'm smart.

17:18.744 --> 17:20.979
Smarter than that
stuck-up bitch reporter.

17:21.047 --> 17:22.012
Come on, Grace.

17:22.080 --> 17:24.616
I got to get out of here.

17:24.684 --> 17:28.053
Why? So you can
screw more guys?

17:28.121 --> 17:29.788
You think, as a little girl,
I dreamed I'd waste

17:29.856 --> 17:31.156
my life away in the bughouse?

17:31.224 --> 17:33.091
I want to go to Paris, France.

17:33.159 --> 17:35.227
They're 20 years ahead of us.

17:35.295 --> 17:37.296
Here, I'm a freak.
There I'd be celebrated.

17:37.364 --> 17:39.399
Haven't you read <i>Delta of Venus?</i>

17:39.466 --> 17:42.669
Anais Nin embraced her sexuality
without apology.

17:42.737 --> 17:44.971
You're from there-- you must
know what I'm talking about.

17:45.039 --> 17:46.940
We left when I was nine.

17:47.008 --> 17:49.776
But my mother and sister,
we speak French at home.

17:49.844 --> 17:52.212
I'm gonna get out of here
with or without you.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.548
We could help each other.

17:54.616 --> 17:55.783
Please?

17:55.851 --> 17:57.618
(man yells in distance)

17:57.686 --> 18:00.888
MAN: No, no.
ORDERLY: Come on.

18:10.331 --> 18:12.165
Feathering your love nest?

18:14.669 --> 18:16.103
The radio said there was a danger

18:16.171 --> 18:18.606
of the bridge being washed out
by the storm.

18:18.674 --> 18:20.842
I thought it prudent
to spend the night.

18:24.346 --> 18:26.581
Sister Jude, I've had a very long,

18:26.649 --> 18:28.583
particularly strange day.

18:28.651 --> 18:33.054
Whatever it is you wanted,
I'm sure can wait till tomorrow.

18:33.122 --> 18:35.890
"Ravish Me Red"?

18:35.958 --> 18:38.660
(thunder crashes)

18:38.728 --> 18:41.296
Sister Mary Eunice told me everything.

18:53.142 --> 18:55.610
I admired her purity.

18:55.678 --> 18:58.379
Her innocence.

18:58.447 --> 19:00.782
I never had any.

19:00.850 --> 19:02.617
Even as a boy.

19:02.685 --> 19:04.285
Now it's gone.

19:04.353 --> 19:05.920
It's been taken from her.

19:05.988 --> 19:09.123
Are those tears?

19:09.191 --> 19:11.459
Sister Mary Eunice

19:11.526 --> 19:12.927
has been corrupted.

19:12.995 --> 19:16.130
It's this place.
Those patients.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.832
That loathsome Shelley.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.834
She's a wretched influence.

19:19.901 --> 19:21.768
If she's been corrupted,
it's because of you.

19:21.836 --> 19:24.671
Your leers are quite transparent.

19:24.739 --> 19:27.241
She's a sensitive child.

19:27.308 --> 19:29.877
Your perversion has
awakened something in her

19:29.944 --> 19:31.712
that she can't begin to understand.

19:31.780 --> 19:34.648
My feelings for her are nothing
if not entirely pure.

19:34.716 --> 19:37.851
She came in here and propositioned me!

19:37.919 --> 19:39.453
Exposed herself to me, like a whore.

19:39.520 --> 19:40.921
I see through your game.

19:40.988 --> 19:42.088
You're trying

19:42.156 --> 19:43.924
to drive me from my position,

19:43.991 --> 19:45.759
so you can take over.

19:45.827 --> 19:48.262
First the newspaper...

19:48.329 --> 19:50.698
and now, lipstick?

19:52.668 --> 19:55.036
But it's not gonna work
because you don't know

19:55.104 --> 19:57.239
what you think you know.

19:57.307 --> 20:01.110
You're coming apart
at the seams, Sister.

20:01.178 --> 20:04.547
Perhaps it would be best
if you took a leave of absence.

20:07.717 --> 20:08.617
(quiet laugh)

20:09.886 --> 20:12.720
I'm on to you.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.427
Blessed are thee,
blessed are thou among women...

20:19.494 --> 20:22.630
(phone ringing)

20:30.672 --> 20:34.040
Briarcliff Manor.

20:34.108 --> 20:36.743
Hello?

20:36.811 --> 20:40.513
Hello?
Who is this?

20:40.581 --> 20:43.049
GIRL:
You left me there.

20:46.887 --> 20:49.322
Who...

20:49.390 --> 20:53.226
who is this?

20:53.294 --> 20:56.129
You never even bothered
to get out of the car.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.933
(sobbing)

21:08.109 --> 21:11.045
I'm sorry.

21:11.112 --> 21:12.413
I'm so sorry.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.249
(click, dial tone drones)

21:21.924 --> 21:24.192
(sobbing)

21:24.260 --> 21:25.827
No... (sobs)

22:17.989 --> 22:19.690
(thunder crashes)

22:33.940 --> 22:35.207
ANNOUNCER:
Travel warnings continue

22:35.275 --> 22:37.276
for Freemont and Braintree Counties.

22:37.344 --> 22:39.545
Flooding expected in Miranda
and parts of Cape Cod.

22:39.612 --> 22:41.747
Stay indoors.

22:41.815 --> 22:43.349
We have more on those strange
lights sighted

22:43.416 --> 22:45.284
over parts of Wasagee County.

22:45.352 --> 22:46.685
Residents continue to insist

22:46.753 --> 22:48.321
these are not lightning strikes.

22:48.388 --> 22:51.423
Fears of a possible downed
aircraft have put

22:51.491 --> 22:53.525
local emergency
rescue workers on the alert.

22:53.593 --> 22:56.929
So far, the cause of the strange
activity remains a mystery.

22:58.531 --> 23:01.400
(patients clamoring)

23:10.776 --> 23:12.210
(blows whistle)

23:18.552 --> 23:20.753
Take your seats!

23:20.821 --> 23:23.556
Take your seats!
No more dillydallying!

23:23.624 --> 23:24.324
Sit down!

23:26.127 --> 23:27.160
Sit down!

23:31.232 --> 23:32.532
Is everyone accounted for?

23:32.600 --> 23:33.800
The Mexican wasn't in

23:33.868 --> 23:36.269
her room, so I was
gonna go look for her.

23:36.336 --> 23:38.171
No, I want you to stay here.

23:38.239 --> 23:41.674
I'll go, after
I introduce the picture.

23:41.742 --> 23:43.109
Okey-doke.

23:46.947 --> 23:49.182
Welcome, one and all,

23:49.250 --> 23:53.453
to Briarcliff Manor's
inaugural movie night.

23:53.520 --> 23:55.321
(chuckles)

23:55.389 --> 24:00.661
Whether this evening marks the
start of a, of a beloved trend,

24:00.728 --> 24:07.335
tradition, or just another
bitter disappointment,

24:07.402 --> 24:09.504
is entirely up to you.

24:13.442 --> 24:16.644
Now...

24:16.712 --> 24:21.282
settle in, relax,
and return with me now

24:21.350 --> 24:24.319
to ancient Rome as we present

24:24.387 --> 24:30.925
the 1932
Cecil B. DeMille classic,

24:30.993 --> 24:33.161
<i>The Sign of the Cross,</i>

24:33.228 --> 24:39.267
starring Miss Claudette Colbert
as the Empress Poppea...

24:39.335 --> 24:40.969
or "Po-ppea,"

24:41.037 --> 24:44.206
and as the Emperor Nero,

24:44.274 --> 24:49.344
the incomparable
Mr. Charles Laughton...

24:49.412 --> 24:51.880
who I understand
is an enormous whoopsie.

24:51.948 --> 24:53.715
(thunder crashes, patients scream)

24:53.783 --> 24:56.318
Now none of that!
None of that! None of that.

24:56.386 --> 24:57.919
Chin up! Chin up high! Hey!

25:01.691 --> 25:03.993
Now don't be afraid of the dark.

25:07.363 --> 25:10.499
At the end...

25:10.566 --> 25:13.302
of a storm...

25:13.369 --> 25:14.670
is a golden sky...

25:14.738 --> 25:19.508
the bright silver song...

25:19.575 --> 25:21.509
of a lark.

25:21.577 --> 25:25.546
Walk on through the wind.

25:25.614 --> 25:28.216
Walk on through the rain.

25:28.283 --> 25:30.952
(chuckles)

25:31.020 --> 25:35.157
Though your dreams may be tossed
and blown...

25:35.225 --> 25:40.229
walk on, walk on...

25:40.297 --> 25:43.867
with hope...

25:43.935 --> 25:45.402
in your heart.

25:49.141 --> 25:50.441
And you'll never walk alone.

25:50.509 --> 25:52.843
You'll never walk a...

25:52.911 --> 25:54.912
But she was alone.

25:58.117 --> 26:03.255
A tiny, little fragile
thing out, out in the world,

26:03.322 --> 26:06.391
in the gloaming.

26:06.458 --> 26:10.328
And the storm that came...

26:10.395 --> 26:16.167
was not rain and it was not wind.

26:16.235 --> 26:20.438
It was something...

26:20.506 --> 26:22.140
altogether else.

26:24.543 --> 26:26.310
(gasps)

26:27.913 --> 26:29.113
(thunder crashes, patients clamor)

26:35.487 --> 26:36.754
Lights.

26:36.822 --> 26:38.823
I'm off to find the Mexican.

26:48.133 --> 26:50.267
What the hell was that all about?

26:50.335 --> 26:52.269
LANA: She's bats,
or hadn't you noticed?

26:52.337 --> 26:54.271
MAN (in film):
Burn, Rome, burn!

26:54.339 --> 26:57.975
(laughing)

26:58.043 --> 27:00.344
Did you speak to Wendy?
What?

27:00.411 --> 27:03.647
I tried to phone you,
but there was no answer.

27:03.715 --> 27:05.149
So I went to check on her.

27:05.217 --> 27:06.951
(door creaks)

27:07.019 --> 27:08.819
Hello?

27:08.887 --> 27:10.621
<i>I rang the bell,</i>
<i>but the door was unlocked,</i>

27:10.689 --> 27:11.856
<i>so I let myself in.</i>

27:18.697 --> 27:20.197
(door creaks)

27:22.034 --> 27:23.867
Hello? Is anyone here?

27:25.470 --> 27:27.171
Miss Peyser?

27:31.476 --> 27:32.943
Wendy?

27:33.011 --> 27:34.845
(wind whistling)

27:37.848 --> 27:40.917
Miss Winters, I know how
alarming this is, but I'm afraid

27:40.985 --> 27:42.419
something might have
happened to your friend.

27:42.487 --> 27:44.654
What do you mean?

27:44.722 --> 27:48.191
(wind whistling)

27:48.259 --> 27:52.061
THREDSON:
<i>There were certain similarities</i>

27:52.129 --> 27:54.029
<i>between Miss Peyser's disappearance</i>

27:54.065 --> 27:56.065
<i>Shh!</i>
<i>and some of the other victims.</i>

27:58.201 --> 27:59.768
Shh!
Other victims?

27:59.836 --> 28:01.870
What are you saying?

28:01.938 --> 28:03.438
MAN (in film):
Yes, Divine Caesar, these rumors

28:03.506 --> 28:07.141
about my setting fire to the city...

28:07.208 --> 28:09.576
That I have some...
Shh!

28:09.644 --> 28:12.079
Shh!

28:12.147 --> 28:15.449
Couldn't we shift the blame to...?

28:15.517 --> 28:18.052
The Christian?

28:18.119 --> 28:19.720
(man yelling)

28:19.788 --> 28:21.588
(film continues indistinctly)

28:26.394 --> 28:28.629
That I have some concerns,

28:28.697 --> 28:30.398
concerns which I've
related to the police.

28:30.465 --> 28:33.701
But unfortunately, they're
so invested in the idea

28:33.769 --> 28:35.102
that they've already
caught their maniac

28:35.170 --> 28:37.604
that they won't even
entertain the idea.

28:37.672 --> 28:40.440
But maybe they haven't.

28:40.508 --> 28:42.509
(man yelling)
Sit down and watch the movie!

28:42.577 --> 28:45.245
Hey, Bernie?

28:47.548 --> 28:49.916
(yelling continues)

28:49.984 --> 28:52.718
But they have caught him,
haven't they?

28:52.786 --> 28:56.521
Do you think I could use
the bathroom really quickly?

28:56.589 --> 28:58.223
What is it with you people?

28:59.392 --> 29:00.692
Haven't they?

29:00.760 --> 29:05.763
To be honest, I'm not so sure anymore.

29:05.831 --> 29:08.533
I'm having my period.
Ah, I don't want to hear it.

29:08.600 --> 29:10.201
Don't make me come with you, okay?

29:10.269 --> 29:12.303
Yeah. Thank you.

29:15.374 --> 29:17.776
WOMAN (in film):
Which perfume, Empress?

29:17.843 --> 29:20.312
EMPRESS:
The jasmine and the acacia.

29:20.379 --> 29:24.783
(various patients wolf whistling)

29:24.851 --> 29:28.920
There are so many beautiful
women in Rome.

29:28.988 --> 29:31.656
It's really not appropriate
for me to be seeing this...

29:31.724 --> 29:34.225
considering my condition.
Sister Jude will understand.

29:34.293 --> 29:36.561
I'm going to the ladies'.

29:36.628 --> 29:39.330
POPPEA: Dacia, you're a butterfly
with the sting of a wasp.

29:39.398 --> 29:40.798
Take off your clothes.

29:40.866 --> 29:45.002
Get in here and tell me all about it.

29:45.070 --> 29:47.571
Hello?

29:47.639 --> 29:49.140
(thunder crashes)

29:55.647 --> 29:57.080
Where's that goddamn Mexican?

29:57.148 --> 29:58.882
(distant clank)

30:03.522 --> 30:05.657
Who's there?

30:10.829 --> 30:12.062
Who's there?

30:20.904 --> 30:23.239
We picked a hell of a night for it.

30:23.307 --> 30:24.774
Yeah, it's good.
Perfect, in fact.

30:24.841 --> 30:26.809
The storm will cover our tracks.

30:26.876 --> 30:29.378
All we have to do is
go through those doors,

30:29.445 --> 30:31.680
through the staff lounge
and into the boiler room.

30:31.747 --> 30:32.948
And that'll take us where, Narnia?

30:33.015 --> 30:35.150
There's an old tunnel

30:35.218 --> 30:37.318
that leads into the woods--
assuming it's really there.

30:37.386 --> 30:40.055
It's there. That touched nun
brought me through it.

30:40.122 --> 30:42.557
I'll show you;
just take me with you.

30:42.625 --> 30:46.494
Screw you.
You had your chance.

30:46.562 --> 30:49.064
I was wrong about you.
I'm sorry.

30:49.132 --> 30:50.799
But someone I love may be in danger.

30:50.867 --> 30:53.168
I know you can understand that.

30:53.236 --> 30:54.269
GRACE:
We have to take her down.

30:54.337 --> 30:55.904
She'll raise the alarm.

30:55.972 --> 30:57.639
No, she won't.
She's coming with us.

30:57.707 --> 30:59.074
GRACE:
What?!

30:59.142 --> 31:00.375
We don't have time to argue.
Come on.

31:02.512 --> 31:03.913
Shit.

31:03.980 --> 31:06.048
Carl's out there.
What are we gonna do?

31:06.116 --> 31:07.116
Whatever we have to.

31:07.184 --> 31:08.485
We may not get another chance.

31:08.552 --> 31:09.719
We're going through that door.

31:09.787 --> 31:11.288
You're not taking down Carl.

31:11.355 --> 31:14.191
He was a Marine.
He fought in Korea.

31:14.259 --> 31:16.693
I'll make sure
you get through the door.

31:16.761 --> 31:19.096
Just, just try and wait for me.
Wait for you?

31:19.164 --> 31:21.431
If you can't, if I don't make it out,

31:21.499 --> 31:24.301
make sure you write the story

31:24.368 --> 31:26.002
that blows the doors off this place.

31:26.070 --> 31:27.804
Don't forget about me.

31:30.341 --> 31:32.676
Shelley, what are you doing out here?

31:32.744 --> 31:34.812
I got bored.
Yeah, you're always bored.

31:34.879 --> 31:38.015
You need to be in that movie
with the others. Go on.

31:38.082 --> 31:39.349
I've already seen it.

31:39.417 --> 31:41.151
The Christians get eaten.

31:41.219 --> 31:43.420
I'd rather be eating something else.

31:43.488 --> 31:45.622
Shelley, I don't have time.

31:45.690 --> 31:46.923
The Mexican's missing.

31:46.991 --> 31:48.925
Jude's out here looking, too.

31:48.993 --> 31:50.227
Did you check the hydrotherapy room?
What?

31:50.295 --> 31:53.197
Come on, Carl...
I'll help you look.

31:53.265 --> 31:55.133
You never know where
she might be hiding.

31:57.069 --> 31:58.770
Shit, Shelley.

31:59.973 --> 32:01.841
Come on.

32:07.516 --> 32:09.583
Stop!

32:10.819 --> 32:13.287
Damn it, I said stop!

32:27.834 --> 32:29.835
There you are...

32:29.903 --> 32:31.704
whore.

32:39.813 --> 32:40.546
(groans)

32:47.388 --> 32:49.322
I don't see a door.
It's here.

32:52.760 --> 32:54.328
Come on.

33:04.006 --> 33:05.172
Whore.

33:07.043 --> 33:07.876
Whore...

33:14.350 --> 33:15.517
Whore!

33:20.156 --> 33:22.024
(moaning)

33:24.028 --> 33:25.695
Hey, why'd you stop?

33:27.798 --> 33:29.432
I'm sorry, Carl.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.334
I gotta get out of here.

33:31.402 --> 33:34.170
(screams, gasps)

33:34.237 --> 33:36.172
(thunder crashing)

33:39.709 --> 33:41.042
Where do you think you're going...

33:43.946 --> 33:45.280
...whore?

33:54.222 --> 33:55.956
(rattling in distance)

33:58.794 --> 34:00.160
(door clanks, screeches open)

34:00.228 --> 34:01.428
(thunder rumbling)

34:01.496 --> 34:03.263
We waited as long as we can.

34:03.331 --> 34:05.032
Something must have happened to her.

34:05.100 --> 34:06.366
Any minute now, they're gonna
notice we're missing

34:06.434 --> 34:07.768
from that movie,
if they haven't already.

34:07.835 --> 34:09.703
We'll get her out.
Her and everybody else.

34:09.771 --> 34:11.638
I'll expose every
sick thing going on here.

34:17.978 --> 34:18.911
Let's go.

34:18.980 --> 34:20.781
(thunder crashing)

34:25.987 --> 34:27.789
(whooping, laughing)

34:30.626 --> 34:33.360
I didn't think I could feel
this good ever again,

34:33.429 --> 34:34.594
and I hate the rain.

34:37.132 --> 34:39.132
(thunder crashing)

34:39.201 --> 34:40.301
Come on, we have to get
as far away from here,

34:40.369 --> 34:42.103
while we still can.

34:42.170 --> 34:43.670
From what I remember,

34:43.737 --> 34:44.605
the road's a couple miles
north of here.

34:44.672 --> 34:46.306
That way, through the trees.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.141
I don't trust you.
Once we get to the road,

34:48.210 --> 34:49.476
that's as far as you go with us.

34:52.614 --> 34:55.650
(anxious whimpering)

34:55.717 --> 34:57.551
(hissing)

34:57.619 --> 35:00.120
(woman screaming in film)

35:02.891 --> 35:05.392
It's our time!
It's our time!

35:05.459 --> 35:07.393
We're not afraid.

35:07.461 --> 35:09.595
MAN (in film): Stand up there!
(whip cracks)

35:09.663 --> 35:12.032
WOMAN (in film):
Go proudly! Singing!

35:12.099 --> 35:15.736
There is no death, only
a crossing over to the Father.

35:15.803 --> 35:19.039
(lions growling in film)

35:20.141 --> 35:21.875
Excuse me.
What?

35:21.943 --> 35:23.510
There appear to be
some patients missing.

35:23.578 --> 35:24.578
Have you been aware of that?

35:27.815 --> 35:28.749
Oh, shit.

35:28.816 --> 35:30.150
Pepper pee.

35:30.218 --> 35:32.286
Yeah, go on. Go pee.

35:32.354 --> 35:35.322
(Christian martyrs singing in film)

35:38.293 --> 35:39.360
Excuse me, Sister.

35:39.428 --> 35:40.761
I think we might have a problem.

35:40.829 --> 35:42.463
Now?

35:42.531 --> 35:45.333
But the Christians are
about to be eaten.

35:45.401 --> 35:46.601
(thunder crashing)

35:50.172 --> 35:52.007
(singing continues in film)

35:57.080 --> 35:58.380
(thunder crashes)

35:58.448 --> 36:00.149
I was just going to the infirmary.

36:00.216 --> 36:00.783
(lock clicks)

36:03.920 --> 36:05.287
I think I'm going to vomit.
That's fine.

36:07.157 --> 36:08.524
Go ahead.

36:08.592 --> 36:09.692
We can play doctor right here.

36:09.760 --> 36:11.794
No, I'm not in the mood.

36:11.861 --> 36:12.828
(chuckles)

36:12.896 --> 36:14.630
You're always in the mood.

36:14.698 --> 36:17.499
I must be the only guy in
here who hasn't had you yet.

36:17.567 --> 36:19.401
That's not true.

36:19.469 --> 36:21.604
What's more, I'm the one
who does the choosing.

36:21.671 --> 36:23.406
Not tonight.

36:23.473 --> 36:26.776
Turn around... and
spread your cheeks.

36:26.843 --> 36:29.912
I thought I repulsed you.
Any port in a storm.

36:29.980 --> 36:30.813
Now bend over!
(yells)

36:30.881 --> 36:32.715
(thunder crashes)

36:32.783 --> 36:34.150
I don't want to.

36:34.218 --> 36:35.485
I want to go back to the movie.

36:35.553 --> 36:36.420
(with mock sympathy):
Oh...

36:38.056 --> 36:39.189
(Shelley yells)

36:39.257 --> 36:42.192
No...! No!

36:42.259 --> 36:44.661
No! Help!

36:44.728 --> 36:46.929
Rape!

36:46.997 --> 36:47.997
(scoffing): Rape.
Help!

36:48.065 --> 36:50.332
That's rich, coming from you.

36:50.399 --> 36:52.200
(screams)
Go ahead, scream your head off.

36:52.268 --> 36:53.835
No one's going to hear you in here.

36:53.903 --> 36:55.336
Help!

36:57.606 --> 37:00.641
(laughing, then muffled snickering)

37:00.709 --> 37:02.476
Don't you dare laugh at me.

37:04.112 --> 37:05.446
(laughing):
What happened?

37:05.514 --> 37:06.414
Shut up!

37:06.482 --> 37:08.449
Were you in an accident?

37:08.517 --> 37:10.952
Oh, you're seven feet all,
I thought you'd be hung like...

37:11.019 --> 37:11.752
Shut up!
(thud)

37:14.355 --> 37:15.956
(thunder crashing)

37:18.993 --> 37:19.826
(screams)

37:22.597 --> 37:24.298
(screams)

37:24.365 --> 37:26.133
I think we found the Mexican!

37:26.201 --> 37:28.602
(eerie growling in distance)

37:38.481 --> 37:40.182
KIT: Run!
(screaming)

37:47.791 --> 37:50.126
What are they?
What's chasing us!

37:50.194 --> 37:51.594
(screaming)

37:51.662 --> 37:52.595
KIT: Don't look back!
Just run!

37:52.663 --> 37:54.764
(screeching)

37:54.831 --> 37:56.165
(growls)

37:56.233 --> 37:57.066
Come on!

37:58.635 --> 38:00.303
KIT: Go! Run, run!
Into the tunnel!

38:12.882 --> 38:14.416
(door clanks shut)

38:14.483 --> 38:18.019
(knocking on door)
Sister Jude? Sister Jude?

38:18.087 --> 38:20.488
Sister...

38:20.556 --> 38:21.556
you need to wake up.

38:25.595 --> 38:27.597
What's going on?
Frank said I had to fetch you.

38:27.664 --> 38:29.232
There's a big problem.
They're very worried.

38:29.299 --> 38:31.434
Oh, my God in Heaven.

38:31.502 --> 38:32.802
They've seen it, too.

38:32.870 --> 38:35.338
Seen what, Sister?

38:38.009 --> 38:39.042
What...?

38:44.282 --> 38:47.418
Please explain to me
how three patients

38:47.485 --> 38:50.655
could just get up and walk out
of here right under your nose.

38:50.722 --> 38:53.124
I guess I was just watching the movie.
Yeah.

38:53.191 --> 38:56.227
(crowd yelling in movie)

38:56.294 --> 38:58.396
MAN (in movie):
...renounced his faith.

38:58.463 --> 39:00.464
Movie night is at an end.

39:00.532 --> 39:02.566
(audience protesting)
But the picture's not over.

39:02.634 --> 39:04.702
Yeah, well, they all die.
Satisfied?

39:04.770 --> 39:06.304
Now, listen up.

39:06.371 --> 39:09.006
There will not be another movie night

39:09.074 --> 39:11.242
nor any other special privileges

39:11.309 --> 39:13.077
in the foreseeable future.

39:13.144 --> 39:16.881
And for that, you can thank
the three scofflaws

39:16.948 --> 39:18.849
who abused my good will.

39:18.917 --> 39:21.385
(thunder crashes)

39:23.288 --> 39:27.157
A sex-crazed deviant, a Mexican,

39:27.225 --> 39:30.994
and a pinhead won't get far
in this storm.

39:31.062 --> 39:32.596
I hope they all drown out there.

39:32.664 --> 39:34.931
Lights out in ten minutes.

39:34.999 --> 39:37.000
All right, let's go.

39:39.403 --> 39:41.305
(raspy breathing)

39:44.509 --> 39:45.342
(groans)

39:49.514 --> 39:50.547
(gasping)

39:50.615 --> 39:52.849
SHELLEY:
Please...

39:52.917 --> 39:54.351
let me go.

39:58.023 --> 39:59.890
Sister Jude will look for me.

39:59.958 --> 40:01.225
Oh, they are looking for you.

40:01.293 --> 40:04.795
In the woods.

40:04.863 --> 40:06.997
You see, they all think
you ran away last night,

40:07.065 --> 40:09.767
along with several of the others.

40:09.835 --> 40:14.739
In fact, Sister Jude thinks
you're the ringleader.

40:14.807 --> 40:16.441
(anxious gasping)

40:16.508 --> 40:18.643
Please...

40:18.711 --> 40:21.179
if you let me walk out of here,

40:21.246 --> 40:22.580
I won't tell them anything.

40:22.648 --> 40:24.449
I promise!

40:24.516 --> 40:25.683
I'm afraid that's quite impossible.

40:25.751 --> 40:27.986
You were a very
naughty girl last night.

40:28.053 --> 40:31.422
You tried to fly away,
so I had to clip your wings.

40:31.490 --> 40:32.924
But not to worry.

40:32.992 --> 40:35.293
My surgical training was impeccable.

40:38.364 --> 40:39.364
(gasps)

40:40.366 --> 40:43.335
