SAM: Thanks for

00:03.128 --> 00:04.588
the late dinner.

00:04.630 --> 00:06.465
Ah, my kitchen's always

00:04.630 --> 00:06.465
open for you.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.509
And the gluten

00:06.507 --> 00:08.509
was extra tasty.

00:10.302 --> 00:12.387
-That wasn't pasta?

00:10.302 --> 00:12.387
-It was pasta.

00:12.429 --> 00:13.931
Oh, good.

00:13.973 --> 00:15.223
It wasn't chicken.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.309
(BOTH LAUGHING)

00:17.351 --> 00:19.269
Well, the chicken

00:17.351 --> 00:19.269
that isn't chicken

00:19.311 --> 00:21.104
goes really well

00:19.311 --> 00:21.104
with the coffee

00:19.311 --> 00:21.104
that isn't coffee.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.481

-(SIGHS)

00:23.106 --> 00:24.566
-Mmm.

00:26.401 --> 00:29.279
So, I'm going to

00:26.401 --> 00:29.279
let Linda move

00:26.401 --> 00:29.279
into my spare room.

00:30.071 --> 00:31.031
For Nick?

00:31.866 --> 00:34.201
Yeah, but not forever.

00:34.242 --> 00:35.410
You're a really good father.

00:35.452 --> 00:36.453
(CHUCKLES)

00:36.495 --> 00:37.830
You play?

00:37.872 --> 00:38.998
A little.

00:39.623 --> 00:41.124
What's your game?

00:41.166 --> 00:42.668
-Texas Hold'em,

00:41.166 --> 00:42.668
what's yours?

00:41.166 --> 00:42.668
-Mmm!

00:42.710 --> 00:46.171
Ah, if it wasn't for poker,

00:42.710 --> 00:46.171
I would've starved

00:42.710 --> 00:46.171
at med school.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.465
(CHUCKLES)

00:46.213 --> 00:48.465
You wanna go

00:46.213 --> 00:48.465
a few rounds?

00:48.507 --> 00:51.092
Absolutely.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.303
But I gotta warn you,

00:51.134 --> 00:53.303
I have a really good

00:51.134 --> 00:53.303
poker face.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.849
Actually...

00:56.891 --> 00:59.059
You have a slight

00:56.891 --> 00:59.059
eye twitch when

00:56.891 --> 00:59.059
you aren't being

00:59.100 --> 01:00.644
-100 percent honest.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.644
-(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:00.686 --> 01:01.812
I can prove it to you.

01:01.854 --> 01:02.938
-Oh, can you?

01:01.854 --> 01:02.938
-Mmm-hmm.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.189
Just lie to me

01:02.980 --> 01:04.189
about something.

01:05.357 --> 01:06.984
Um...

01:07.026 --> 01:10.029
Oh. You know,

01:07.026 --> 01:10.029
I do like this tea

01:07.026 --> 01:10.029
better than coffee.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.489
Twitch. You don't

01:10.070 --> 01:12.489
like my tea?

01:14.241 --> 01:16.076
Well, I like the company

01:14.241 --> 01:16.076
that comes with the tea.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.039
-No twitch?

01:18.829 --> 01:20.039
-No twitch.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.248
Hmm.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.083
Hmm.

STEPHANIE:

01:45.230 --> 01:46.105
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.495
You didn't

01:57.785 --> 02:00.495
have to drive my mom

01:57.785 --> 02:00.495
back to Grey House.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.497
I wanted to.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.332
Sounds like you two

02:02.539 --> 02:04.332
really hit it off?

02:05.375 --> 02:06.710
Yeah.

02:06.752 --> 02:09.170
Guess the real question's

02:06.752 --> 02:09.170
why you thought we wouldn't.

02:09.212 --> 02:11.465
-Are you

02:09.212 --> 02:11.465
embarrassed of me?

02:09.212 --> 02:11.465
-(SIGHS)

02:12.549 --> 02:14.175
Look...

02:14.217 --> 02:15.677
You don't know

02:14.217 --> 02:15.677
my mother.

02:15.719 --> 02:18.179
What does that mean?

02:18.221 --> 02:22.935
She's nice, but, she's always

02:18.221 --> 02:22.935
had certain expectations about

02:18.221 --> 02:22.935
the men I date.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.103
Your mom didn't lie.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.772
-I didn't mean to lie.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.772
-Mmm.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.066
And it was more

02:26.814 --> 02:29.066
of an omission

02:26.814 --> 02:29.066
than an outright lie.

02:29.108 --> 02:31.359
So, when you were

02:29.108 --> 02:31.359
shuffling us around

02:29.108 --> 02:31.359
making sure we never met,

02:31.401 --> 02:32.235
that was just what?

02:32.861 --> 02:34.029
That was wrong.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.406
Ah.

02:36.448 --> 02:39.576
Look, if you're embarrassed

02:36.448 --> 02:39.576
to let anyone know

02:36.448 --> 02:39.576
that we're dating,

02:40.786 --> 02:41.829
then why are we dating?

02:45.290 --> 02:46.500
I'll see you.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.183
Mom.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.687
What you got there?

(INHALES)

03:11.733 --> 03:13.027
GRACE: I remember

03:11.733 --> 03:13.027
making this for Daddy.

03:14.402 --> 03:15.194
You miss him?

03:16.822 --> 03:19.658
Sam helps you miss him

03:16.822 --> 03:19.658
a little less, doesn't he?

03:19.700 --> 03:22.201
I know that's why

03:19.700 --> 03:22.201
you don't wanna take

03:19.700 --> 03:22.201
this driving test.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.165
You don't want

03:23.620 --> 03:26.165
the time you spend

03:23.620 --> 03:26.165
with Sam to be over.

03:26.456 --> 03:27.541
No.

03:30.627 --> 03:34.422
-(CHUCKLES)

03:30.627 --> 03:34.422
Yes, but it's okay.

03:30.627 --> 03:34.422
-You can talk to me.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.219
Talking to you will

03:37.300 --> 03:39.219
just make things worse.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.472
'Cause it will

03:40.929 --> 03:42.472
make you sad, Mom,

03:42.514 --> 03:43.682
and that'll just make me

03:42.514 --> 03:43.682
miss him more.

03:45.559 --> 03:48.562
Look, I can feel how badly

03:48.603 --> 03:50.689
you wanna try

03:48.603 --> 03:50.689
and make the situation

03:48.603 --> 03:50.689
better for me,

03:50.731 --> 03:52.024
but you can't.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.109
No one can.

(SIGHS)

03:57.988 --> 03:59.781

03:57.988 --> 03:59.781

03:57.988 --> 03:59.781
Nick's waiting.

03:59.823 --> 04:01.449
Okay, I love you.

04:01.491 --> 04:02.450
I love you more.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.247
Hi, sweetheart.

04:08.289 --> 04:09.666
Mom, what's going on?

04:10.375 --> 04:11.251
I'm moving in.

04:12.669 --> 04:13.837
Into the spare room.

04:13.879 --> 04:16.090
Your father and I both

04:13.879 --> 04:16.090
wanna live with you,

04:16.131 --> 04:17.841
so this is the

04:16.131 --> 04:17.841
perfect solution.

04:17.883 --> 04:19.801
But temporary solution.

04:21.011 --> 04:23.847

04:21.011 --> 04:23.847
-Great.

04:23.889 --> 04:26.600
-Ugh, what a mess.

04:23.889 --> 04:26.600
-No. You don't

04:23.889 --> 04:26.600
have to do that.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.977
-Yeah, I'll do it.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.977
-Thank you.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.773
No, no, no, no, no.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.773
That goes in the disposal.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.691
No, you can't put

04:32.814 --> 04:34.691
anything large

04:32.814 --> 04:34.691
in that disposal.

04:34.733 --> 04:37.152
It's delicate

04:34.733 --> 04:37.152
and clogs up easily.

04:37.194 --> 04:40.363
Sam, you're being silly.

04:37.194 --> 04:40.363
Disposals are meant

04:37.194 --> 04:40.363
to handle food.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.532
This particular disposal

04:40.405 --> 04:42.532
can't handle more than

04:40.405 --> 04:42.532
a few grains of rice.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.743
Yeah, he's right.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.327
Okay, I get it.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.830
Your house, no food

04:46.369 --> 04:48.830
in the disposal, got it.

04:48.872 --> 04:49.998
Right.

BETTY: Ben is very sweet.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.045
He is that.

04:55.087 --> 04:57.380
And successful.

04:55.087 --> 04:57.380
Self-made man.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.174
-Mom.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.174
-What?

04:59.216 --> 05:02.261
Don't pretend for a second

04:59.216 --> 05:02.261
that you're okay with Ben.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.012
-Why wouldn't I be?

05:02.302 --> 05:04.012
-Ah. (CHUCKLES)

05:04.054 --> 05:05.430
He's not your type.

05:05.472 --> 05:06.932
And what is my type?

05:07.682 --> 05:09.726
Rich.

05:09.768 --> 05:14.481
I have dated

05:09.768 --> 05:14.481
and married wealthy men

05:09.768 --> 05:14.481
and not so wealthy men.

05:14.522 --> 05:16.608
I don't have

05:14.522 --> 05:16.608
a problem with Ben.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.444
But I think you might.

05:19.486 --> 05:23.364
You should've seen him.

05:19.486 --> 05:23.364
He was so upset.

05:23.406 --> 05:27.368
If you really care about Ben,

05:23.406 --> 05:27.368
you have to fight.

05:23.406 --> 05:27.368
Win him back.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.164
But you have always said

05:27.410 --> 05:30.164
men should do the chasing.

05:30.205 --> 05:34.042
Stephanie,

05:30.205 --> 05:34.042
you are choosing to listen to

05:30.205 --> 05:34.042
what I said decades ago

05:34.084 --> 05:36.878
instead of what

05:34.084 --> 05:36.878
I'm saying right now.

05:36.920 --> 05:40.090
For the record,

05:36.920 --> 05:40.090
my last marriage

05:36.920 --> 05:40.090
was my happiest.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.424
Joey.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.635
And I had to pursue him

05:41.466 --> 05:43.635
all the way to Vegas.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.137
(LAUGHING)

05:48.598 --> 05:50.767
What's up with you

05:48.598 --> 05:50.767
not getting your license?

05:50.809 --> 05:52.311
I'm not ready.

05:52.351 --> 05:54.980
You're not ready

05:52.351 --> 05:54.980
for a test? No way.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.817
This one is different, okay?

05:58.859 --> 05:59.860
Can we please have

05:58.859 --> 05:59.860
two bagels?

06:00.485 --> 06:01.862
Thanks.

06:01.903 --> 06:04.363
So, I heard that

06:01.903 --> 06:04.363
your mom is moving

06:01.903 --> 06:04.363
out of Grey House.

06:05.615 --> 06:09.077
Uh, yeah,

06:05.615 --> 06:09.077
she's moving in with us.

06:09.119 --> 06:12.080
Okay. And how come

06:09.119 --> 06:12.080
you don't look happier?

06:12.122 --> 06:15.500
I wanted there

06:12.122 --> 06:15.500
to be peace with

06:12.122 --> 06:15.500
everyone, but...

06:15.542 --> 06:17.836
I never thought

06:15.542 --> 06:17.836
she'd be living at my Dad's.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.839
She always

06:19.046 --> 06:20.839
has to be right.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.133
Oh, can you talk to her?

06:20.881 --> 06:23.133
Tell her how you feel?

06:23.175 --> 06:24.968
She wouldn't listen.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.261
Okay, well then,

06:25.010 --> 06:26.261
maybe your dad

06:25.010 --> 06:26.261
can help her.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.471
I don't wanna

06:26.303 --> 06:28.471
cause trouble.

06:28.513 --> 06:31.016
If my dad says

06:28.513 --> 06:31.016
something to

06:28.513 --> 06:31.016
my mom, then...

06:31.058 --> 06:32.309
-Trouble?

06:31.058 --> 06:32.309
-Yeah.

06:32.351 --> 06:33.727
Got it.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.188
Look, my mom got

06:33.768 --> 06:36.188
what she wanted.

06:36.855 --> 06:37.898
She always does.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.610
-What about you, Nick?

06:39.774 --> 06:42.610
-Does it matter?

06:42.652 --> 06:44.363
Of course, it does.

06:44.403 --> 06:45.655
Are you feeling

06:44.403 --> 06:45.655
bad for me?

06:45.697 --> 06:46.990
Kind of.

06:47.032 --> 06:48.825
-Thanks.

06:47.032 --> 06:48.825
-Good.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.577
Then you can

06:48.867 --> 06:50.577
buy me my bagel.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.996
-Ah. Smooth.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.996
-Ah. Yeah, real smooth.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.207
(LAUGHING) Thank you.

06:57.334 --> 07:00.212
BRANDON: See you tomorrow.

07:00.254 --> 07:04.883
Hey. I, uh, just wanna

07:00.254 --> 07:04.883
thank you again for taking

07:00.254 --> 07:04.883
care of my nephew.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.261
-Here.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.261
-What's this?

07:07.302 --> 07:10.138
It's a gift certificate

07:07.302 --> 07:10.138
for that French restaurant

07:07.302 --> 07:10.138
in Blairsville.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.057
-Oh, fancy.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.057
-Yeah, well.

07:12.099 --> 07:16.270
I was gonna bring Tara

07:12.099 --> 07:16.270
to the bistro for lunch

07:12.099 --> 07:16.270
but this is much nicer.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.521
You didn't

07:16.311 --> 07:18.521
have to do this, though,

07:16.311 --> 07:18.521
I mean, Max was great.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.315
Yeah, he's a sweet baby.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.025
But look, man,

07:20.357 --> 07:22.025
babies are a lot of work.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.443
Yes, they are. (SIGHS)

07:23.484 --> 07:26.363
Bet you Tara loved

07:23.484 --> 07:26.363
Max, though, right?

07:26.405 --> 07:28.448
Sure, I mean,

07:26.405 --> 07:28.448
who doesn't love a baby?

07:29.366 --> 07:31.243
You need a puppy,

07:29.366 --> 07:31.243
my friend.

07:31.285 --> 07:34.746
-Excuse me?

07:31.285 --> 07:34.746
-Yeah, you gotta get a puppy.

07:31.285 --> 07:34.746
It'll buy you some time.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.791
My brother,

07:34.788 --> 07:37.791
before he had Max,

07:34.788 --> 07:37.791
had Bella, a rescue lab.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.877
(CHUCKLES) That dog

07:37.832 --> 07:40.877
must've bought him like

07:37.832 --> 07:40.877
three years.

07:40.919 --> 07:43.713
-(CHUCKLES) A puppy?

07:40.919 --> 07:43.713
-Yeah, works like a charm.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.141
-Would you like

07:52.389 --> 07:54.141
some company?

07:52.389 --> 07:54.141
-Of course.

07:56.435 --> 07:58.145
How's the work coming,

07:56.435 --> 07:58.145
any progress?

07:58.186 --> 08:01.481
No, I'm afraid you were right.

08:01.522 --> 08:04.443
Stephanie's not the answer

08:01.522 --> 08:04.443
to my writer's block.

08:04.484 --> 08:08.238
Every day, I feel

08:04.484 --> 08:08.238
my wife's voice

08:04.484 --> 08:08.238
slipping away.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.782
Well, I can tell you

08:08.280 --> 08:10.782
from experience

08:08.280 --> 08:10.782
that she's still there.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.243
I wish that I believed you.

08:13.285 --> 08:16.871
Belief is just a wish

08:13.285 --> 08:16.871
you make happen.

08:16.913 --> 08:20.208
Thank you for everything,

08:16.913 --> 08:20.208
but I think it's time

08:16.913 --> 08:20.208
to go home.

08:22.294 --> 08:25.755
Would you stop by

08:22.294 --> 08:25.755
Grey House before you leave?

08:22.294 --> 08:25.755
I have a gift for you.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.675
You've given me enough.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.675
It's not necessary.

08:28.716 --> 08:31.219
Oh, it is necessary.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.138
Then I'll come by tomorrow

08:31.261 --> 08:33.138
on my way out of town.

08:39.478 --> 08:40.770
-(KNOCKING)

08:39.478 --> 08:40.770
-SHARON: <i> Come in.</i>

08:42.314 --> 08:43.398
Hi.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.277
So, all your test results

08:44.899 --> 08:47.277
came back negative.

08:47.319 --> 08:49.946
-False positive.

08:47.319 --> 08:49.946
-Excuse me?

08:49.988 --> 08:51.656
Labs make mistakes

08:49.988 --> 08:51.656
all the time.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.992
The only safe way

08:51.698 --> 08:53.992
is to redo all the tests.

08:54.034 --> 08:58.163
And I have two new

08:54.034 --> 08:58.163
troubling symptoms,

08:54.034 --> 08:58.163
dry eyes and dry mouth.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.415
Well, you're taking

08:58.205 --> 09:00.415
an antihistamine

08:58.205 --> 09:00.415
with a decongestant.

09:00.457 --> 09:03.793
-It's a common side effect.

09:00.457 --> 09:03.793
-Well, I'm allergic to horses.

09:03.835 --> 09:06.463
-Hmm. You have a horse?

09:03.835 --> 09:06.463
-Yes, Mr. Butters.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.631
(LAUGHING)

09:08.673 --> 09:10.509
For a doctor,

09:08.673 --> 09:10.509
you're very easy to talk to.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.554
Um, Eve mentioned

09:11.926 --> 09:14.554
you were single.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.264
Is that right?

09:22.020 --> 09:23.480
(DOOR CHIMES)

09:26.066 --> 09:27.984
-Good morning, Cassie.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.984
-John.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.570
-Did you get my flowers?

09:28.026 --> 09:30.570
-The

09:28.026 --> 09:30.570
arrangement was beautiful.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.365
I found this book.

09:33.407 --> 09:37.536
It catalogs other artifacts

09:33.407 --> 09:37.536
from the same period

09:33.407 --> 09:37.536
as your <i> Horse with Groom.</i>

09:39.079 --> 09:41.581
-Ha. Be still my heart.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.581
-(LAUGHING)

09:42.332 --> 09:43.458
Wow.

09:45.502 --> 09:48.380
So, how goes it at

09:45.502 --> 09:48.380
the university, settling in?

09:48.422 --> 09:51.758
Um, I'm about as settled

09:48.422 --> 09:51.758
as I think I can get.

09:51.799 --> 09:55.554
But working at the university

09:51.799 --> 09:55.554
does have its perks.

09:51.799 --> 09:55.554
Do you remember Bert Branter?

09:55.595 --> 09:58.639
Do I remember

09:55.595 --> 09:58.639
the foremost authority on the

09:55.595 --> 09:58.639
Indus Valley Civilization?

09:58.681 --> 10:01.101
Yes, I remember him.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.101
I even met him once.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.936
Well, he's speaking

10:01.142 --> 10:02.936
at the university tonight.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.105
-You wanna come?

10:04.229 --> 10:05.105
-Yes.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.647
It'll be fun.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.442
You're probably the only

10:06.689 --> 10:08.442
person I can think of

10:08.483 --> 10:11.194
who would think a lecture on

10:08.483 --> 10:11.194
the Indus Civilization is fun.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.947
Hmm, not the only person.

10:19.244 --> 10:23.457
Martha.

10:19.244 --> 10:23.457
I left Michael at home.

10:19.244 --> 10:23.457
He was just getting up.

10:23.498 --> 10:26.084
Oh, poor lamb,

10:23.498 --> 10:26.084
he's exhausted.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.169
(SCOFFS) From staying out late

10:26.126 --> 10:28.169
hanging out with his friends.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.754
He's very popular.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.048
He should be exhausted

10:29.796 --> 10:32.048
from working.

10:32.090 --> 10:36.803
A job will not keep

10:32.090 --> 10:36.803
him here, in Middleton,

10:32.090 --> 10:36.803
but a career will.

10:36.844 --> 10:39.556
He needs to be gainfully

10:36.844 --> 10:39.556
employed by the end

10:36.844 --> 10:39.556
of the week.

10:39.598 --> 10:43.351
Things are in the works.

10:39.598 --> 10:43.351
Irons and fires all over.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.978
Don't worry, I've got this.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.938
What happened

10:45.019 --> 10:46.938
with the job at the bank?

10:46.980 --> 10:49.107
Sadly, that interview

10:46.980 --> 10:49.107
didn't pan out.

10:49.816 --> 10:50.650
He didn't get the job?

10:51.859 --> 10:53.487
He didn't go to the interview.

10:53.528 --> 10:56.114
-(SIGHS)

10:53.528 --> 10:56.114
-That job wasn't

10:53.528 --> 10:56.114
right for Michael.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.199
He shouldn't be

10:56.156 --> 10:58.199
an assistant at his age.

10:58.241 --> 10:59.951
Enough is enough.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.621
Either you have a talk

10:59.993 --> 11:02.621
with Michael or I will.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.664
But, Tom.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.466
Ahem.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.675
Seems my sign

11:14.508 --> 11:16.675
has hopped

11:14.508 --> 11:16.675
across the street.

11:16.717 --> 11:18.470
I had a feeling

11:16.717 --> 11:18.470
I might find it here.

11:18.512 --> 11:21.014
I had no choice.

11:18.512 --> 11:21.014
You know Sophie quit?

11:21.055 --> 11:24.267
There are no shortcuts to

11:21.055 --> 11:24.267
finding the right employee.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.520
I don't have time to meet

11:24.309 --> 11:26.520
with a bunch of people.

11:26.561 --> 11:29.856
I think you're looking

11:26.561 --> 11:29.856
for an easy solution

11:26.561 --> 11:29.856
to a complicated problem.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.274
What does that mean?

11:31.316 --> 11:34.068
That finding someone

11:31.316 --> 11:34.068
to replace Sophie

11:31.316 --> 11:34.068
isn't your only issue.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.695
Yes, it is.

11:36.737 --> 11:39.698
Look, I have 50 centerpieces

11:36.737 --> 11:39.698
to finish tomorrow night.

11:39.740 --> 11:43.744
I need help,

11:39.740 --> 11:43.744
and everybody I know

11:39.740 --> 11:43.744
seems to be busy.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.498
You think my sign will

11:43.786 --> 11:46.498
bring in someone to do

11:43.786 --> 11:46.498
all the work for you?

11:46.831 --> 11:48.625
Yes.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.793
You already tried that

11:48.667 --> 11:50.793
with Sophie.

11:50.835 --> 11:54.255
Cassie, your sign is simply

11:50.835 --> 11:54.255
the easiest and quickest

11:50.835 --> 11:54.255
solution to my problem.

11:54.297 --> 11:55.756
Okay? End of story.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.386
I thought it was great.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.973
-Where have you two been?

12:01.762 --> 12:03.973
-Poulter Academy.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.059
Why would you be there?

12:06.100 --> 12:07.435
I set up a tour for Nick.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.690
-Nick has a school.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.690
-Yes, but...

12:11.730 --> 12:13.149
And he's doing

12:11.730 --> 12:13.149
very well, there.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.734
Um, and I have homework.

12:17.820 --> 12:18.905
(SIGHS)

12:20.532 --> 12:22.200
Did he say

12:20.532 --> 12:22.200
he wanted to switch schools?

12:22.242 --> 12:25.328
No, but I can tell

12:22.242 --> 12:25.328
that he isn't being

12:22.242 --> 12:25.328
challenged at Middleton.

12:25.370 --> 12:28.789
If he has a prayer of getting

12:25.370 --> 12:28.789
into a decent college,

12:25.370 --> 12:28.789
he needs a better school.

12:28.831 --> 12:32.335
(SIGHS) Are you trying

12:28.831 --> 12:32.335
to drive him away?

12:32.377 --> 12:35.963
Because if that's

12:32.377 --> 12:35.963
your intention,

12:32.377 --> 12:35.963
you're doing a bang-up job.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.466
If he wanted me to stop,

12:36.005 --> 12:38.466
he would ask me to.

12:38.508 --> 12:41.344
Seriously, leave him alone.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.970
He's not a project,

12:41.386 --> 12:42.970
he's your son.

12:46.349 --> 12:47.850
I thought Linda got

12:46.349 --> 12:47.850
all her bags.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.144
(SIGHS)

12:50.186 --> 12:53.106
-Linda has a lot of baggage.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.106
-(LAUGHING)

12:53.147 --> 12:56.067
Well, I bet Nick is happy

12:53.147 --> 12:56.067
to have her back home.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.446
He's not.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.446
Linda can be overbearing.

12:59.487 --> 13:02.865
Hmm, people

12:59.487 --> 13:02.865
who are controlling are

12:59.487 --> 13:02.865
usually driven by fear.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.993
I think Linda just likes

13:02.907 --> 13:05.993
to tell people what to do.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.579
You know, Nick is

13:06.035 --> 13:07.579
lucky to have you.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.956
Ah, he's a good kid.

13:09.997 --> 13:14.127
If putting up with Linda,

13:09.997 --> 13:14.127
is what it takes, well, that's

13:09.997 --> 13:14.127
a sacrifice worth making.

13:14.168 --> 13:16.713
When it comes to your child,

13:14.168 --> 13:16.713
there isn't anything

13:14.168 --> 13:16.713
you wouldn't do.

13:16.755 --> 13:17.796
-I'm not the only one.

13:16.755 --> 13:17.796
-(LAUGHS)

13:19.716 --> 13:23.010
You're awfully dressed up

13:19.716 --> 13:23.010
for a Wednesday night.

13:19.716 --> 13:23.010
Hot date?

13:23.052 --> 13:25.555
Hot lecture on the

13:23.052 --> 13:25.555
Indus Valley Civilization.

13:25.597 --> 13:29.392
-(BOTH LAUGHING)

13:25.597 --> 13:29.392
-John knows how to show

13:25.597 --> 13:29.392
a lady a good time.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.269
-Do you wanna come?

13:29.434 --> 13:31.269
-No.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.980
I had enough of the Indus

13:31.311 --> 13:33.980
people at my third year

13:31.311 --> 13:33.980
cultural anthropology class.

13:34.021 --> 13:36.857
-Hmm.

13:34.021 --> 13:36.857
-I was desperate

13:34.021 --> 13:36.857
for an elective.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.360
-Emphasis on the desperate.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.360
-(LAUGHING)

13:39.402 --> 13:41.028
-But you have a good time.

13:39.402 --> 13:41.028
-Oh, I will.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.782
-Need a ride?

13:41.070 --> 13:43.782
-Isn't that out of your way?

13:43.822 --> 13:46.409
Oh, it's only about

13:43.822 --> 13:46.409
eight or ten miles from

13:43.822 --> 13:46.409
the place I ordered pizza.

13:46.451 --> 13:49.203
Oh, yeah, yeah.

13:46.451 --> 13:49.203
No problem, I actually have

13:46.451 --> 13:49.203
a ride, but next time.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.080
Okay.

14:00.632 --> 14:01.882
Hi.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.344
-I'm working.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.344
-I know.

14:06.763 --> 14:11.142
Brought your favorites.

14:06.763 --> 14:11.142
BLT, fries and two desserts.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.226
Thanks.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.647
You didn't need to do this.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.231
I'm really sorry

14:15.689 --> 14:17.231
for what I did.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.569
It was wrong of me,

14:19.359 --> 14:21.569
lying to you.

14:22.654 --> 14:23.863
I've been doing

14:22.654 --> 14:23.863
some thinking.

14:26.658 --> 14:29.786
When we first met,

14:26.658 --> 14:29.786
you thought we were

14:26.658 --> 14:29.786
too different to be together.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.788
I just needed to learn

14:29.828 --> 14:31.788
to be more open.

14:31.830 --> 14:35.124
That's just it.

14:31.830 --> 14:35.124
I don't think that's how

14:31.830 --> 14:35.124
a relationship should work.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.543
You shouldn't have

14:35.166 --> 14:36.543
to learn to wanna be

14:35.166 --> 14:36.543
with me.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.003
You should just

14:37.918 --> 14:39.003
wanna be with me,

14:40.046 --> 14:41.339
not be embarrassed.

14:44.342 --> 14:45.885
I don't think we should

14:44.342 --> 14:45.885
see each other anymore.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.263
Ben.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.731
My treat, for the lecture.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.940
Uh, no, no.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.940
You came with me,

14:57.772 --> 14:59.940
my treat.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.150
(LAUGHS)

15:04.987 --> 15:06.989
We can eat first.

15:07.031 --> 15:09.367
Then, we'll have the

15:07.031 --> 15:09.367
strength to arm-wrestle

15:07.031 --> 15:09.367
each other for the bill.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.203
(CHUCKLES)

15:09.409 --> 15:12.203
I really enjoyed the lecture.

15:12.245 --> 15:15.707
I could tell, you asked

15:12.245 --> 15:15.707
more questions than anyone.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.375
I can't believe

15:15.749 --> 15:17.375
Bert remembered me.

15:18.710 --> 15:21.170
You are kind of unforgettable.

15:21.212 --> 15:25.633
So, I have this, uh,

15:21.212 --> 15:25.633
Formal Archeology Department

15:21.212 --> 15:25.633
function tomorrow night.

15:25.675 --> 15:26.926
And I don't have a plus one.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.679
Anna can't make it.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.972
You'll have to dress up

15:29.721 --> 15:31.972
and it'll likely be boring,

15:32.014 --> 15:34.601
including bad food

15:32.014 --> 15:34.601
and bad speeches,

15:36.811 --> 15:38.979
but I'd love to have

15:36.811 --> 15:38.979
at least one person

15:36.811 --> 15:38.979
there I know.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.816
Hmm. With a buildup like that,

15:39.021 --> 15:41.816
how could I say "no"?

15:41.858 --> 15:43.234
-Is that a "yes"?

15:41.858 --> 15:43.234
-That's a "yes".

15:44.611 --> 15:45.820
I think I like hearing

15:44.611 --> 15:45.820
you say "yes".

15:45.862 --> 15:47.614
Well,

15:45.862 --> 15:47.614
then ask me if I'm hungry.

15:47.655 --> 15:48.948
-Are you hungry?

15:47.655 --> 15:48.948
-Yes, let's order.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.324
-All right.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.324
-(LAUGHING)

15:57.123 --> 15:58.040
Thank you.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.210
I'm glad we got to do this.

16:03.045 --> 16:03.963
Dad?

16:04.964 --> 16:06.173
What's up?

16:07.801 --> 16:11.596
I'm supposed to be

16:07.801 --> 16:11.596
at school and you're

16:07.801 --> 16:11.596
supposed to be at work.

16:11.638 --> 16:15.349
Yeah, speaking of school,

16:11.638 --> 16:15.349
do you really wanna switch?

16:16.976 --> 16:20.647
-Yeah, it'll be easier.

16:16.976 --> 16:20.647
-Than what?

16:20.688 --> 16:24.191
You know,

16:20.688 --> 16:24.191
when Mom wants something,

16:20.688 --> 16:24.191
it's easier just to go along.

16:24.233 --> 16:28.613
(LAUGHING) Yes,

16:24.233 --> 16:28.613
but if you don't wanna

16:24.233 --> 16:28.613
go to private school...

16:30.406 --> 16:31.240
Hey, you have

16:30.406 --> 16:31.240
a say in this.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.994
Your opinion matters.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.994
What you want matters.

16:35.745 --> 16:38.623
But Mom likes it her way.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.083
And you're afraid

16:38.665 --> 16:41.083
if you don't go along with

16:38.665 --> 16:41.083
what your mother wants...

16:41.125 --> 16:43.252
Dad, it's fine, okay?

16:44.921 --> 16:46.005
It's between me and Mom.

16:46.297 --> 16:47.465
(SIGHS)

16:49.759 --> 16:51.010
Yoo-hoo!

16:51.051 --> 16:53.012
ABIGAIL: Martha.

16:53.053 --> 16:54.931
Is that a new jacket?

16:53.053 --> 16:54.931
It's very bold.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.349
Oh, well, I...

16:58.058 --> 17:01.103
My dinner has been

16:58.058 --> 17:01.103
moved up by an hour.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.272
-No problem.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.272
-How are my centerpieces?

17:03.314 --> 17:04.899
You know, I think

17:03.314 --> 17:04.899
I'm gonna actually

17:03.314 --> 17:04.899
have to slow down

17:04.941 --> 17:06.734
because they'll be

17:04.941 --> 17:06.734
ready too soon.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.654
-Nobody wants

17:06.776 --> 17:09.654
wilted flowers at a dinner.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.654
-There's only two!

17:09.696 --> 17:13.574
I will need all 50 there

17:09.696 --> 17:13.574
at least one hour before

17:09.696 --> 17:13.574
the dinner starts.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.618
They will be there,

17:13.616 --> 17:15.618
on time and ready to go.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.620
I saw your help wanted sign.

17:17.662 --> 17:20.999
I hope I don't need to

17:17.662 --> 17:20.999
remind you how important

17:17.662 --> 17:20.999
this dinner is to me,

17:21.040 --> 17:22.959
to my position

17:21.040 --> 17:22.959
in the community.

17:23.835 --> 17:26.004
-I understand.

17:23.835 --> 17:26.004
-Well, good.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.839
Because I'd hate for you

17:26.045 --> 17:27.839
to get a reputation

17:27.881 --> 17:30.884
as a businesswoman

17:27.881 --> 17:30.884
whose word cannot be trusted.

17:31.342 --> 17:32.468
Hmm.

17:35.596 --> 17:36.890
(SIGHS)

17:41.060 --> 17:43.437
Ah, did you see

17:41.060 --> 17:43.437
that truck I passed?

17:43.479 --> 17:45.356
(LAUGHING) Better

17:43.479 --> 17:45.356
than that, it saw you.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.900
True.

17:46.941 --> 17:48.568
And you still don't

17:46.941 --> 17:48.568
wanna take your test?

17:48.609 --> 17:49.652
Ugh, no, I'm not ready yet.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.865
Wait, unless you think

17:51.612 --> 17:53.865
I'm taking up too much

17:51.612 --> 17:53.865
of your time?

17:53.907 --> 17:57.117
I promised that these lessons

17:53.907 --> 17:57.117
would end up with you getting

17:53.907 --> 17:57.117
your license, and they will.

17:57.159 --> 17:59.579
-However long it takes.

17:57.159 --> 17:59.579
-Thanks. (CHUCKLES)

18:00.580 --> 18:03.332
Wow, your office

18:00.580 --> 18:03.332
is really cool.

18:03.374 --> 18:06.627
(LAUGHING) Nobody's

18:03.374 --> 18:06.627
ever called a doctor's

18:03.374 --> 18:06.627
office "cool" before.

18:06.669 --> 18:10.924
Well,

18:06.669 --> 18:10.924
it's not just the office,

18:06.669 --> 18:10.924
it's what you do here.

18:10.965 --> 18:14.677
And I love science.

18:10.965 --> 18:14.677
I'm in AP chemistry

18:10.965 --> 18:14.677
and biology.

18:14.719 --> 18:17.638
Double-threat. Should

18:14.719 --> 18:17.638
I call ahead to Stanford

18:14.719 --> 18:17.638
and reserve your room?

18:17.680 --> 18:20.099
(LAUGHS) I actually

18:17.680 --> 18:20.099
wanna go to Yale.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.601
I'm also in AP physics.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.686
-(SCOFFS PLAYFULLY)

18:21.642 --> 18:23.686
Is that all?

18:21.642 --> 18:23.686
-(LAUGHS) Hey!

18:23.728 --> 18:27.732
-(PHONE CHIMES)

18:23.728 --> 18:27.732
-Oh, um, I'm so sorry

18:23.728 --> 18:27.732
to drive and run,

18:27.774 --> 18:29.692
but I'm gonna be late

18:27.774 --> 18:29.692
for my study group.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.692
I'll see you later.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.819
-Hey, Grace.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.819
-Yeah?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.948
-Nice job today.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.948
-Thank you.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.116
Hi.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.368
Oh.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.370
Is this, uh, Grace's?

18:53.257 --> 18:54.467
(DOORBELL RINGING)

19:02.516 --> 19:04.018
Hello.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.562
Hi. Cassie asked me

19:04.060 --> 19:06.562
to come by.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.188
Are you,

19:06.604 --> 19:08.188
by any chance,

19:06.604 --> 19:08.188
Carl Winstead?

19:09.732 --> 19:11.109
Wow!

19:11.150 --> 19:16.363
-I am such a fan.

19:11.150 --> 19:16.363
-CARL: Thank you.

19:16.405 --> 19:19.575
I was just reading this

19:16.405 --> 19:19.575
or, rereading this.

19:19.617 --> 19:22.328
Apparently,

19:19.617 --> 19:22.328
Cassie's a fan too.

19:19.617 --> 19:22.328
She has all your books.

19:22.369 --> 19:26.958
This is the third time

19:22.369 --> 19:26.958
I've read this and I still,

19:22.369 --> 19:26.958
I can't put it down.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.334
That's sweet of you to say.

19:28.375 --> 19:31.420
You write the most

19:28.375 --> 19:31.420
beautiful love stories.

19:31.462 --> 19:35.133
My wife, she taught

19:31.462 --> 19:35.133
me a lot about love.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.385
-Ah, so, she's your muse.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.385
-Yes.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.889
You know,

19:38.427 --> 19:41.889
when my husband died,

19:38.427 --> 19:41.889
I was inconsolable.

19:41.931 --> 19:44.308
And a friend gave me

19:41.931 --> 19:44.308
one of your books.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.476
And reading your novels,

19:46.602 --> 19:50.230
somehow allowed me

19:46.602 --> 19:50.230
to forget for a bit

19:50.773 --> 19:52.108
how sad I was.

19:52.984 --> 19:54.068
Got me through the first year.

19:55.069 --> 19:57.155
I recently lost my wife.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.198
I'm so sorry.

20:00.282 --> 20:03.369
Yeah, it's been overwhelming.

20:04.162 --> 20:05.496
Of course, it is.

20:07.456 --> 20:10.501
What are you doing

20:07.456 --> 20:10.501
for yourself?

20:10.543 --> 20:12.879
To keep your mind

20:10.543 --> 20:12.879
not quite so focused on grief?

20:14.296 --> 20:16.590
You have to find something.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.467
It's the only way

20:16.632 --> 20:18.467
you're gonna get

20:16.632 --> 20:18.467
through it and survive.

20:29.854 --> 20:33.191
Where's my PlayStation?

20:33.232 --> 20:37.195
Your father, he lets

20:33.232 --> 20:37.195
you play way too many

20:33.232 --> 20:37.195
videogames.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.113
Honestly, just try it

20:37.236 --> 20:39.113
for a week, you'll see.

20:40.322 --> 20:43.492
Hey, come here for a sec.

20:43.534 --> 20:47.371
Listen, I was thinking that

20:43.534 --> 20:47.371
I would come and watch

20:43.534 --> 20:47.371
your practice today.

20:47.413 --> 20:50.708
Uh, it might be canceled.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.419
It might be canceled?

20:50.750 --> 20:53.419
Is it canceled or not?

20:54.336 --> 20:56.380
I'm, I'm not sure.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.132
(LAUGHING)

20:58.174 --> 21:01.928
Nicky, you know I can tell

20:58.174 --> 21:01.928
when you're not

20:58.174 --> 21:01.928
telling the truth, right?

21:01.969 --> 21:04.222
It's right there,

21:01.969 --> 21:04.222
the raised eyebrow.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.222
It's your tell.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.182
Ever since you were

21:04.263 --> 21:06.182
three years old

21:06.224 --> 21:09.727
and knocked that vase

21:06.224 --> 21:09.727
over in our living room

21:06.224 --> 21:09.727
and blamed it on the dog.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.771
We didn't have a dog.

21:11.812 --> 21:15.191
Exactly! Not a good liar then,

21:11.812 --> 21:15.191
not a good liar now.

21:17.401 --> 21:20.988
(SIGHS) Mom, I don't

21:17.401 --> 21:20.988
wanna be on the team.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.866
Nick, you've made

21:22.281 --> 21:23.866
a commitment.

21:23.908 --> 21:25.743
Yeah, but still...

21:25.785 --> 21:27.453
And you're very

21:25.785 --> 21:27.453
good at it.

21:27.494 --> 21:28.788
But I don't like it.

21:30.581 --> 21:32.917
Oh, look, it's only until

21:30.581 --> 21:32.917
the end of the year.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.293
Next year,

21:32.959 --> 21:34.293
you'll be at Poulter,

21:34.334 --> 21:35.502
and if you don't wanna

21:34.334 --> 21:35.502
play basketball,

21:35.544 --> 21:37.171
then, sweetheart,

21:35.544 --> 21:37.171
you don't have to.

21:39.048 --> 21:41.300
Poulter has

21:39.048 --> 21:41.300
an excellent squash team.

21:39.048 --> 21:41.300
They're nationally ranked.

21:42.760 --> 21:43.803
You like squash.

21:48.933 --> 21:50.768
-Hey, there.

21:48.933 --> 21:50.768
-Oh, hey, Sam.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.311
This is Grace's.

21:52.352 --> 21:55.940
Oh, she'd be heartbroken

21:52.352 --> 21:55.940
if she lost this.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.818
She gave it to her father

21:55.982 --> 21:58.818
when she was a little girl.

21:58.859 --> 22:01.862
I think I know why she doesn't

21:58.859 --> 22:01.862
wanna take her driving test.

22:01.904 --> 22:03.030
She misses her dad so much.

22:03.614 --> 22:05.365
Yeah, I'm sorry.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.701
Hard enough losing Jake,

22:05.407 --> 22:07.701
but watching Grace

22:07.743 --> 22:10.163
and Lori and Brandon

22:07.743 --> 22:10.163
lose their father...

22:10.204 --> 22:11.872
I've never known

22:10.204 --> 22:11.872
loss like that.

22:11.914 --> 22:13.332
I hope you never do.

22:13.373 --> 22:16.085
And like everything you do,

22:13.373 --> 22:16.085
you make it look effortless.

22:17.377 --> 22:20.089
You can talk to me

22:17.377 --> 22:20.089
about this, anytime.

22:20.923 --> 22:23.176
I'm a pretty good listener.

22:23.217 --> 22:26.344
Grace would be really upset

22:23.217 --> 22:26.344
if she knew we were

22:23.217 --> 22:26.344
having this conversation.

22:26.386 --> 22:27.345
What conversation?

22:29.723 --> 22:32.101
There's nothing worse than

22:29.723 --> 22:32.101
seeing your child in pain,

22:32.143 --> 22:34.352
knowing no matter what you do,

22:32.143 --> 22:34.352
you can't fix it for them.

22:45.198 --> 22:46.364
(EXHALING)

22:48.159 --> 22:49.702
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

22:48.159 --> 22:49.702
-Come in.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.912
-Hey.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.912
-Michael!

22:53.873 --> 22:55.249
Come, come, sit.

22:58.836 --> 23:02.173
Michael, there is

22:58.836 --> 23:02.173
a slight problem

22:58.836 --> 23:02.173
with your father.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.218
Is this about

23:03.841 --> 23:05.218
my cell phone bill?

23:05.259 --> 23:07.928
No... Wait, what bill?

23:07.970 --> 23:09.471
(SIGHS) Never mind.

23:09.513 --> 23:12.766
No, your father is insisting

23:09.513 --> 23:12.766
that you get a job.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.269
Now.

23:15.311 --> 23:19.106
(SIGHS) Dad doesn't get me,

23:15.311 --> 23:19.106
but you do.

23:19.148 --> 23:21.942
That's why I love you.

23:19.148 --> 23:21.942
You're always there

23:19.148 --> 23:21.942
to protect me.

23:23.777 --> 23:26.613
But don't worry, Mom,

23:23.777 --> 23:26.613
I have a meeting

23:23.777 --> 23:26.613
later on today.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.324
You have a meeting for a job?

23:28.366 --> 23:29.742
Why didn't you tell me?

23:29.783 --> 23:31.535
Where? With whom?

23:29.783 --> 23:31.535
Can I help?

23:31.577 --> 23:33.037
I don't wanna jinx it.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.122
Say no more

23:33.079 --> 23:35.122
and I will ask no more.

23:36.290 --> 23:38.334
Oh, and I used your car

23:36.290 --> 23:38.334
and it's on empty.

23:38.376 --> 23:39.752
Do you want me

23:38.376 --> 23:39.752
to fill it up for you?

23:39.793 --> 23:42.963
What a sweet

23:39.793 --> 23:42.963
and thoughtful gesture.

23:43.005 --> 23:44.173
Should I put it

23:43.005 --> 23:44.173
on your credit card?

23:46.217 --> 23:47.801
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

23:49.345 --> 23:50.428
(CLEARS THROAT)

23:51.389 --> 23:53.140
Thanks, Mom. (KISSES)

23:56.602 --> 24:00.189
And so, when everything

23:56.602 --> 24:00.189
gets back into the lab,

23:56.602 --> 24:00.189
Eve'll give you a call, okay?

24:00.231 --> 24:01.439
It'll be fine.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.362
Sharon is trying to

24:04.360 --> 24:06.362
schedule a bunch of tests.

24:06.404 --> 24:07.780
She's on her way

24:06.404 --> 24:07.780
back from the farm.

24:07.821 --> 24:10.157
(SIGHS) I'll call her back.

24:10.199 --> 24:11.867
She's becoming a real pest.

24:13.911 --> 24:15.037
-What?

24:13.911 --> 24:15.037
-Sorry.

24:15.621 --> 24:16.997
No, it's okay.

24:19.250 --> 24:22.586
It's great, actually.

24:19.250 --> 24:22.586
Call Sharon back.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.213
Get the number for that farm

24:22.628 --> 24:24.213
where she boards her horse

24:24.255 --> 24:26.966
and get them on the phone

24:24.255 --> 24:26.966
for me, please.

24:24.255 --> 24:26.966
As soon as you can.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.469
Ben broke up with me.

24:31.511 --> 24:33.389
He's being totally

24:31.511 --> 24:33.389
unreasonable.

24:33.764 --> 24:34.681
(SCOFFS)

24:35.349 --> 24:36.600
It's broken.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.894
Hello, we're talking here.

24:38.936 --> 24:43.023
As I was saying, Ben is being

24:38.936 --> 24:43.023
completely unreasonable.

24:43.065 --> 24:44.400
When it comes

24:43.065 --> 24:44.400
to relationships,

24:44.442 --> 24:47.320
it's important to find someone

24:44.442 --> 24:47.320
who loves you for who you are,

24:47.361 --> 24:51.115
but you have to love them

24:47.361 --> 24:51.115
for who they are too

24:47.361 --> 24:51.115
and you have to admit,

24:51.157 --> 24:54.410
you haven't been

24:51.157 --> 24:54.410
as enthusiastic as Ben has

24:51.157 --> 24:54.410
about the two of you dating.

24:54.452 --> 24:55.493
That's true.

24:56.078 --> 24:57.537
No one asked you.

24:57.579 --> 24:58.956
Okay, but it's still true.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.542
You know what I think?

25:02.584 --> 25:04.502
I think that maybe

25:02.584 --> 25:04.502
all this is for the best.

25:05.503 --> 25:06.504
Ben and I don't

25:05.503 --> 25:06.504
belong together.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.758
Maybe we shouldn't

25:07.840 --> 25:09.758
even have started dating.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.219
If you really believed that,

25:09.800 --> 25:12.219
you wouldn't be here.

25:13.053 --> 25:14.847
No. (SIGHS)

25:14.888 --> 25:16.265
I really think it's over.

25:21.270 --> 25:22.855
It's not working.

25:22.896 --> 25:25.691
It's not broken.

25:22.896 --> 25:25.691
You're just not

25:22.896 --> 25:25.691
using it properly.

25:25.732 --> 25:28.735
Your intention was

25:25.732 --> 25:28.735
to only serve yourself.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.612
But I won't be

25:28.777 --> 25:30.612
serving anybody,

25:30.654 --> 25:33.699
because there's no way

25:30.654 --> 25:33.699
I can finish

25:30.654 --> 25:33.699
the centerpieces on time

25:33.740 --> 25:35.409
and Martha's going to take

25:33.740 --> 25:35.409
my business tonight

25:35.451 --> 25:37.077
when her dinner

25:35.451 --> 25:37.077
is flower free.

25:37.119 --> 25:37.870
So, you're giving up?

25:39.372 --> 25:42.082
I can't do it.

25:39.372 --> 25:42.082
Not by myself.

25:42.124 --> 25:45.794
Wouldn't it be better

25:42.124 --> 25:45.794
to try and fail

25:42.124 --> 25:45.794
than to just fail?

25:45.836 --> 25:48.130
No, what's the point

25:45.836 --> 25:48.130
of putting in the effort

25:48.172 --> 25:50.216
if you know there's

25:48.172 --> 25:50.216
no hope of succeeding?

-Name it.

26:01.852 --> 26:03.937
May I take Grace to

26:01.852 --> 26:03.937
the hospital, later today?

26:03.979 --> 26:05.563
Hospital?

26:05.605 --> 26:09.276
Oh, you know that thing

26:05.605 --> 26:09.276
that I'm not supposed

26:05.605 --> 26:09.276
to know or talk about?

26:09.318 --> 26:10.403
Yeah?

26:10.444 --> 26:12.071
I got a plan.

26:12.112 --> 26:13.697
I think you're

26:12.112 --> 26:13.697
rubbing off on me.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.949
And taking her

26:13.739 --> 26:15.949
to the hospital will help?

26:15.991 --> 26:17.410
Should be just what

26:15.991 --> 26:17.410

is still on the market.

move where my desk is.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.225
It's not okay.

28:48.602 --> 28:51.021
You're so determined

28:48.602 --> 28:51.021
to control him,

28:51.063 --> 28:52.231
that you're gonna

28:51.063 --> 28:52.231
lose him.

28:53.773 --> 28:54.983
You can make things

28:53.773 --> 28:54.983
easier for him.

28:57.194 --> 28:58.529
I just don't know if you will.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.996
So I needed to drop off some

29:05.077 --> 29:07.996
lab work and I just thought

29:05.077 --> 29:07.996
you might wanna come with me.

29:08.038 --> 29:11.124
Thank you.

29:08.038 --> 29:11.124
This place is great.

29:11.166 --> 29:14.670
-We do share an

29:11.166 --> 29:14.670
affinity for science.

29:11.166 --> 29:14.670
-We do.

29:14.712 --> 29:16.630
We don't get to see enough

29:14.712 --> 29:16.630
of you, Dr. Radford.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.174
He's a fan favorite

29:17.756 --> 29:19.174
around here.

29:19.216 --> 29:20.926
Thank you.

29:20.967 --> 29:22.844
The nurses really

29:20.967 --> 29:22.844
like you here.

29:22.886 --> 29:24.471
Oh, well, this place

29:22.886 --> 29:24.471
has a terrific staff.

29:25.222 --> 29:26.432
What is this?

29:26.473 --> 29:28.975
I decided to take on

29:26.473 --> 29:28.975
an intern or two

29:29.017 --> 29:30.894
from your high school

29:29.017 --> 29:30.894
at my office.

29:30.936 --> 29:33.272
And as soon as I get

29:30.936 --> 29:33.272
the principal to sign on,

29:30.936 --> 29:33.272
it's a go.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.649
For somebody

29:34.440 --> 29:35.649
interested in science,

29:35.691 --> 29:37.484
it would be a really good

29:35.691 --> 29:37.484
learning experience.

29:38.569 --> 29:40.529
-You know anybody?

29:38.569 --> 29:40.529
-Why me?

29:42.406 --> 29:46.952
Look, um, I see

29:42.406 --> 29:46.952
a lot of people at their

29:42.406 --> 29:46.952
very worst moments.

29:46.993 --> 29:50.122
Especially when I was

29:46.993 --> 29:50.122
running the ER in New York.

29:50.163 --> 29:53.626
Death and dying is part of

29:50.163 --> 29:53.626
what I deal with every day.

29:53.667 --> 29:56.503
But I've learned

29:53.667 --> 29:56.503
that one way

29:53.667 --> 29:56.503
to heal from loss

29:56.545 --> 29:58.756
is to give your heart

29:56.545 --> 29:58.756
something else to love.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.633
Not to replace

29:58.797 --> 30:00.633
what it is you lost,

30:00.674 --> 30:02.175
but just to make

30:00.674 --> 30:02.175
the emptiness

30:02.884 --> 30:04.844
less empty.

30:07.931 --> 30:10.142
I know you miss your dad.

30:10.183 --> 30:13.520
And I wish I had

30:10.183 --> 30:13.520
more to offer you

30:10.183 --> 30:13.520
than an internship.

30:15.897 --> 30:16.940
But what do you say?

30:19.818 --> 30:21.820
I say, I better schedule

30:19.818 --> 30:21.820
my driving test.

30:22.279 --> 30:24.030
You're ready.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.865
-I am, thanks to you.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.865
-(CHUCKLING)

30:32.247 --> 30:36.669
The question my heroine

30:32.247 --> 30:36.669
poses to herself is,

30:36.710 --> 30:40.839
"Can you have a once

30:36.710 --> 30:40.839
in a life time love

30:36.710 --> 30:40.839
twice in a lifetime?"

30:42.257 --> 30:43.509
Sorry I'm late.

30:43.550 --> 30:47.471
Oh, don't apologize,

30:43.550 --> 30:47.471
this has been

30:43.550 --> 30:47.471
a real treat for me.

30:47.513 --> 30:50.849
-I didn't recognize

30:47.513 --> 30:50.849
that passage.

30:47.513 --> 30:50.849
-It's from his upcoming book.

30:50.890 --> 30:53.268
It's something I started

30:50.890 --> 30:53.268
before my wife died.

30:53.310 --> 30:55.395
It's beautiful.

30:53.310 --> 30:55.395
You really should finish it.

31:04.404 --> 31:05.864
A gift is totally unnecessary.

31:07.157 --> 31:07.949
Open it.

31:11.244 --> 31:14.707
I acquired this notebook

31:11.244 --> 31:14.707
at an estate sale in England.

31:14.748 --> 31:19.670
The woman who sold it to me

31:14.748 --> 31:19.670
said that the owner was

31:14.748 --> 31:19.670
a famous English writer.

31:19.712 --> 31:23.215
Apparently, it was

31:19.712 --> 31:23.215
the only blank notebook

31:19.712 --> 31:23.215
in his library.

31:23.256 --> 31:25.925
She said he kept it

31:23.256 --> 31:25.925
to remind him of the

31:23.256 --> 31:25.925
darkest time in his life.

31:25.967 --> 31:27.886
A time he lost his voice.

31:30.180 --> 31:31.682
It's too much.

31:31.724 --> 31:34.351
I was just holding it,

31:31.724 --> 31:34.351
waiting for the right person.

31:34.393 --> 31:37.145
And that's me?

31:37.187 --> 31:40.649
This inspiration you have,

31:37.187 --> 31:40.649
it doesn't lie within

31:37.187 --> 31:40.649
anyone else.

31:41.525 --> 31:44.069
Not your lovely wife.

31:44.110 --> 31:46.822
It's in you, and only

31:44.110 --> 31:46.822
you have the power

31:44.110 --> 31:46.822
to unlock it.

31:49.658 --> 31:52.661
Your wife is

31:49.658 --> 31:52.661
always with you.

31:52.703 --> 31:55.080
You don't have to find her.

31:52.703 --> 31:55.080
She's always there,

31:52.703 --> 31:55.080
in your heart.

31:57.791 --> 32:00.919
If you give up writing,

31:57.791 --> 32:00.919
you'll have lost

31:57.791 --> 32:00.919
two things you love.

32:01.879 --> 32:04.172
And your fans need you.

32:04.214 --> 32:05.924
There's a shortage of

32:04.214 --> 32:05.924
love stories in the world.

32:08.510 --> 32:09.762
Well, then,

32:08.510 --> 32:09.762
I better keep writing.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.433
Thank you,

32:11.930 --> 32:14.433
Cassie Nightingale,

32:11.930 --> 32:14.433
for everything.

32:18.645 --> 32:20.272
SHARON: You think

32:18.645 --> 32:20.272
I have Lyme disease?

32:23.108 --> 32:24.860
How?

32:24.902 --> 32:27.696
It's passed into

32:24.902 --> 32:27.696
the bloodstream through

32:24.902 --> 32:27.696
the bite of a deer tick.

32:27.738 --> 32:29.364
But I'm not around deer.

32:29.406 --> 32:32.325
Your horse is.

32:29.406 --> 32:32.325
At that farm,

32:29.406 --> 32:32.325
where you board him.

32:32.367 --> 32:34.286
But all those other

32:32.367 --> 32:34.286
doctors I saw?

32:34.327 --> 32:38.832
The test for Lyme

32:34.327 --> 32:38.832
disease is unreliable until

32:34.327 --> 32:38.832
after the first two months.

32:38.874 --> 32:41.668
In the early stages,

32:38.874 --> 32:41.668
the flu-like symptoms

32:38.874 --> 32:41.668
are often misdiagnosed.

32:43.086 --> 32:44.588
You're sure?

32:44.630 --> 32:45.964
Both the tests

32:44.630 --> 32:45.964
came back positive.

32:48.842 --> 32:49.968
(SIGHS)

32:51.804 --> 32:53.221
Can I get better?

32:53.263 --> 32:57.643
Sure, but it might be

32:53.263 --> 32:57.643
a long road to recovery.

32:57.684 --> 33:02.773
And you may have some

32:57.684 --> 33:02.773
permanent side effects that

32:57.684 --> 33:02.773
you have to monitor, treat...

33:02.815 --> 33:05.818
But I'm gonna do

33:02.815 --> 33:05.818
everything in my power

33:02.815 --> 33:05.818
to get you feeling better.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.779
And you won't be alone.

33:08.821 --> 33:10.697
I'll be with you

33:08.821 --> 33:10.697
every step of the way.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.200
-Thank you, Dr. Radford.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.200
-Sure.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.293
I know you want to say it.

33:23.335 --> 33:26.129
I don't need to say,

33:23.335 --> 33:26.129
"I told you so."

33:26.171 --> 33:29.382
Or that I was right

33:26.171 --> 33:29.382
and you were wrong

33:26.171 --> 33:29.382
about Sharon.

33:29.424 --> 33:30.926
(CHUCKLES)

33:29.424 --> 33:30.926
But you just did.

33:31.885 --> 33:33.011
-Did I?

33:31.885 --> 33:33.011
-Mmm-hmm.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.895
(SIGHS)

34:05.251 --> 34:06.294
(SIGHS)

(DOOR OPENING)

34:13.468 --> 34:14.678
Hey, Sam.

34:16.013 --> 34:18.473
-Hmm, you want some tea?

34:16.013 --> 34:18.473
-Uh, no thanks.

34:20.767 --> 34:22.728
Erythropoietin.

34:22.769 --> 34:26.189
The hormone that

34:22.769 --> 34:26.189
regulates the rate

34:22.769 --> 34:26.189
of erythrocyte production.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.650
-35 across.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.650
-Mmm-hmm. Thank you.

34:28.692 --> 34:30.903
I can't stand

34:28.692 --> 34:30.903
to start a puzzle

34:28.692 --> 34:30.903
and not finish it.

34:30.944 --> 34:33.030
-We have that in common.

34:30.944 --> 34:33.030
-(LAUGHING)

34:33.071 --> 34:35.490
-Hey, Mom.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.490
-Oh, hey, Sam.

34:35.532 --> 34:37.325
-Hey.

34:35.532 --> 34:37.325
-Did you tell her yet?

34:37.367 --> 34:40.245
-Uh, I was just about to.

34:37.367 --> 34:40.245
-Tell me what?

34:40.286 --> 34:43.248
I'm going to be

34:40.286 --> 34:43.248
interning at Sam's office.

34:43.289 --> 34:45.333
-If that's okay with you?

34:43.289 --> 34:45.333
-Of course.

34:45.375 --> 34:47.085
Uh, but I need to take

34:45.375 --> 34:47.085
my driving test first.

34:47.126 --> 34:49.170
That way, I can fully

34:47.126 --> 34:49.170
concentrate on the internship.

34:49.212 --> 34:50.255
Well, congratulations.

34:50.296 --> 34:52.131
I'm totally psyched.

34:50.296 --> 34:52.131
(CHUCKLES)

34:52.173 --> 34:54.051
-Thanks again, Sam.

34:52.173 --> 34:54.051
-Sure.

34:56.845 --> 34:59.723
Thanks for helping me

34:56.845 --> 34:59.723
solve that puzzle.

34:59.765 --> 35:02.225
-You know there isn't anything

34:59.765 --> 35:02.225
I wouldn't do for you guys.

34:59.765 --> 35:02.225
-Hmm.

35:03.060 --> 35:04.227
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

35:05.896 --> 35:08.023
Nick told me

35:05.896 --> 35:08.023
that you were here.

35:08.065 --> 35:11.150
So listen, the disposal

35:08.065 --> 35:11.150
is backed up,

35:11.192 --> 35:13.403
and it's making these

35:11.192 --> 35:13.403
grinding noises.

35:14.487 --> 35:16.031
Clearly, it's defective.

35:14.487 --> 35:16.031
(CHUCKLES)

35:16.823 --> 35:18.116
Clearly.

35:18.951 --> 35:20.452
Yeah, excuse me.

35:20.953 --> 35:22.120
Thanks, Sam.

35:25.916 --> 35:28.543
So, I Imagine

35:25.916 --> 35:28.543
you've heard that

35:28.585 --> 35:32.171
Sam got Nick to support

35:28.585 --> 35:32.171
the idea of me going

35:28.585 --> 35:32.171
back to New York?

35:32.213 --> 35:35.008
No, Sam hasn't said a word,

35:32.213 --> 35:35.008
but knowing Nick,

35:35.050 --> 35:36.843
he's speaking

35:35.050 --> 35:36.843
his own mind, not Sam's.

35:38.011 --> 35:40.097
Cassie, he's a child.

35:40.138 --> 35:44.476
No, look again.

35:40.138 --> 35:44.476
You aren't seeing Nick

35:40.138 --> 35:44.476
for the young man he is.

35:44.517 --> 35:47.228
Well, either way,

35:44.517 --> 35:47.228
it doesn't matter because

35:44.517 --> 35:47.228
with both of them against me,

35:47.270 --> 35:49.731
I am not gonna

35:47.270 --> 35:49.731
win this war.

35:51.524 --> 35:54.277
It's not a war.

35:51.524 --> 35:54.277
It's your family.

35:54.319 --> 35:55.904
And it's not about winning,

35:54.319 --> 35:55.904
it's about love.

36:01.409 --> 36:03.120
LINDA: Nick,

36:01.409 --> 36:03.120
can you come here?

36:12.087 --> 36:13.171
Mom?

36:15.882 --> 36:18.426
Sweetheart, I, um...

36:18.468 --> 36:20.887
I have a little bit

36:18.468 --> 36:20.887
of bad news.

36:20.929 --> 36:25.517
It seems that

36:20.929 --> 36:25.517
my CFO has

36:20.929 --> 36:25.517
unexpectedly quit,

36:25.558 --> 36:28.020
and the board is

36:25.558 --> 36:28.020
requiring me to go back

36:25.558 --> 36:28.020
to New York right away.

36:29.395 --> 36:31.523
I'm sorry. I didn't mean

36:29.395 --> 36:31.523
to hurt your feelings.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.233
(CHUCKLES) Oh, no.

36:34.275 --> 36:36.528
No, honey, I'm... I'm...

36:36.569 --> 36:40.157
I'm not going

36:36.569 --> 36:40.157
because of anything

36:36.569 --> 36:40.157
that you said.

36:40.198 --> 36:44.870
I know that you were upset,

36:40.198 --> 36:44.870
and we all say things we don't

36:40.198 --> 36:44.870
mean when we're upset.

36:44.911 --> 36:48.165
This has everything

36:44.911 --> 36:48.165
to do with my job,

36:48.206 --> 36:49.749
which I have to be

36:48.206 --> 36:49.749
in New York to do.

36:50.876 --> 36:53.753
I have an entire company

36:50.876 --> 36:53.753
depending on me.

36:53.795 --> 36:54.629
And you, you have your...

36:57.256 --> 36:58.884
You have your dad here

36:57.256 --> 36:58.884
to take care of you.

37:01.011 --> 37:02.679
You'll be back, right?

37:02.721 --> 37:05.515
Of course, and you will

37:02.721 --> 37:05.515
come visit me.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.020
I will.

37:11.104 --> 37:12.438
Love you, Mom.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.523
I love you, too.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.196
All right.

37:23.616 --> 37:24.409
Thank you.

37:27.079 --> 37:28.246
I love my son.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.250
Then you did the right thing.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.713
Martha, did I miss it?

37:36.755 --> 37:38.506
The ballroom is empty,

37:36.755 --> 37:38.506
did I get the time wrong?

37:38.548 --> 37:40.592
I didn't have a truck,

37:38.548 --> 37:40.592
so I had to carry them

37:38.548 --> 37:40.592
by hand and then, I...

37:40.633 --> 37:42.135
No, you didn't miss it.

37:42.177 --> 37:44.554
The dinner is not

37:42.177 --> 37:44.554
in the ballroom.

37:42.177 --> 37:44.554
It's in Conference Room B,

37:44.596 --> 37:46.890
-which is down the hall

37:44.596 --> 37:46.890
and to the left.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.890
-(SIGHS)

37:46.932 --> 37:49.684
Go and find Chief Sanders

37:46.932 --> 37:49.684
and he'll get you some help

37:46.932 --> 37:49.684
to carry the centerpieces.

37:49.726 --> 37:51.978
I have to go and

37:49.726 --> 37:51.978
finish working on

37:49.726 --> 37:51.978
my opening remarks.

37:52.562 --> 37:53.813
Oh, my.

37:53.855 --> 37:55.148
That is stunning!

37:55.648 --> 37:57.316
Thanks.

37:57.358 --> 38:00.820
You know, there is a

37:57.358 --> 38:00.820
City Council welcome luncheon

37:57.358 --> 38:00.820
next week.

38:00.862 --> 38:02.697
I'm gonna phone you later

38:00.862 --> 38:02.697
with my order.

38:04.032 --> 38:05.825
-Abigail?

38:04.032 --> 38:05.825
-Yeah?

38:05.867 --> 38:08.703
You're five feet

38:05.867 --> 38:08.703
from the finish line, dear.

38:08.745 --> 38:10.830
Go and get those

38:08.745 --> 38:10.830
flowers where they're

38:08.745 --> 38:10.830
supposed to be.

38:10.872 --> 38:12.124
Chop-chop.

38:18.379 --> 38:19.756
-Here you go.

38:18.379 --> 38:19.756
-Thank you.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.174
My pleasure.

38:21.216 --> 38:23.218
Sorry, no food.

38:23.260 --> 38:24.844
I tried to get the last

38:23.260 --> 38:24.844
two cheese blintzes,

38:24.886 --> 38:27.680
but sadly, I lost that to

38:24.886 --> 38:27.680
a tenured literature prof.

38:27.722 --> 38:28.598
Forgive me.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.476
-John.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.476
-Hey, Bill.

38:31.517 --> 38:33.019
And this must be Anna.

38:33.061 --> 38:34.187
Uh...

38:34.229 --> 38:36.064
-Cassie. (CHUCKLES)

38:34.229 --> 38:36.064
-My mistake.

38:36.106 --> 38:38.650
Oh. It's okay.

38:36.106 --> 38:38.650
Cassie's an old friend

38:36.106 --> 38:38.650
from my college days.

38:38.691 --> 38:40.152
So you two

38:38.691 --> 38:40.152
went to college

38:38.691 --> 38:40.152
together, huh?

38:40.193 --> 38:42.821
-We did.

38:40.193 --> 38:42.821
-Yeah. We haven't seen

38:40.193 --> 38:42.821
each other in 20 years,

38:42.862 --> 38:43.989
and now we're both

38:42.862 --> 38:43.989
living in Middleton.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.866
-Amazing.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.866
-Yeah. You're right.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.866
It is amazing.

38:46.908 --> 38:48.868
So, when will

38:46.908 --> 38:48.868
Anna be joining you?

38:49.911 --> 38:51.788
Uh, she won't.

38:51.830 --> 38:55.041
We decided to

38:51.830 --> 38:55.041
make our temporary

38:51.830 --> 38:55.041
break permanent.

38:55.083 --> 38:56.459
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

38:58.128 --> 39:00.755
-That's the Dean.

38:58.128 --> 39:00.755
If you'll excuse me.

38:58.128 --> 39:00.755
-(CHUCKLES) Sure.

39:00.797 --> 39:01.798
BILL: Thanks.

39:03.675 --> 39:04.801
Hmm.

39:17.939 --> 39:19.398
(ENGINE STARTING)

39:25.780 --> 39:26.698
You okay?

39:28.658 --> 39:29.701
Yeah.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.500
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

39:54.851 --> 39:55.977
Thank you.

39:59.272 --> 40:00.940
I was gonna tell you.

40:00.982 --> 40:02.359
That you and Anna broke up?

40:02.400 --> 40:04.610
-Yeah.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.610
-What happened?

40:04.652 --> 40:06.988
Well, we were apart

40:04.652 --> 40:06.988
more than we were together.

40:07.030 --> 40:09.115
Wow. That can be fixed.

40:09.157 --> 40:10.408
We're still better apart.

40:13.245 --> 40:14.371
It's a beautiful night.

40:14.704 --> 40:15.830
Yeah.

40:16.998 --> 40:19.167
But not as beautiful

40:16.998 --> 40:19.167
as that night in Ibiza.

40:19.209 --> 40:21.336
Oh, but less scary.

40:19.209 --> 40:21.336
(LAUGHING)

40:21.378 --> 40:24.172
In my defense,

40:21.378 --> 40:24.172
it was Brooke's idea

40:21.378 --> 40:24.172
to wedding crash.

40:26.716 --> 40:27.967
(SIGHS)

40:28.009 --> 40:29.635
It's kind of chilly.

40:28.009 --> 40:29.635
Do you wanna

40:28.009 --> 40:29.635
go back inside?

40:29.677 --> 40:31.429
No, I like it out here.

40:37.143 --> 40:38.270
Thank you.

40:48.905 --> 40:50.656
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

40:50.698 --> 40:52.242
Um, sorry.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.620
Um...

40:55.661 --> 40:57.455
Oh, I have to take this,

40:55.661 --> 40:57.455
I'm sorry.

40:59.332 --> 41:00.708
Hey, Sam,

40:59.332 --> 41:00.708
is everything okay?
