The drugs were dad's.

it would be easier

It seems your father
is facing some other charges.

If dad can let it go,
so can you.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.026
What do you mean, let it go?

09:52.113 --> 09:54.724
- You know, the guy in Hudson.
- You told her?

09:54.811 --> 09:56.030
No, of course,
I didn't tell her.

09:56.117 --> 09:57.335
- Rufus!
- I would never.

09:57.422 --> 09:58.510
I overheard
Dan and dad talking.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.208
He heard us
arguing on the phone.

10:00.295 --> 10:01.949
Yeah, if you want to keep
secrets, maybe we should all

10:02.036 --> 10:03.994
abandon the loft and move
to a place with more walls.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.178
It's always good
to give him a while.

10:14.265 --> 10:16.050
Yeah, no,
I knew-I knew that.

10:19.183 --> 10:22.404
I can't believe he told her
you guys were gonna do it.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.711
- Well, I told you.
- That's different. I'm a girl.

10:24.798 --> 10:27.844
- Yeah, well, so is she.
- Exactly my point.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.933
But even if she wasn't,
when you get a boyfriend

10:30.020 --> 10:31.456
you become the best friend

10:31.543 --> 10:33.633
and the best friend becomes
the second best friend.

10:33.720 --> 10:37.245
That's just how it has to be
if it's ever gonna work.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.551
Hey, you still haven't told me
how Nate's doing.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.205
'It's all over the news.'

10:41.292 --> 10:43.294
Uh, when I talked
to him this morning

10:43.381 --> 10:45.296
I told him
to focus on his family today.

10:45.383 --> 10:47.995
But he's still
coming to your party, right?

10:48.082 --> 10:49.605
- Here.
- Uh..

10:49.692 --> 10:51.651
I told him
not to worry about it.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.130
I mean, only if he's up to it.

10:53.217 --> 10:56.568
You're such
a good girlfriend, B, really.

11:00.921 --> 11:04.054
Hey, um, I'll just pick you up,
and we can go together.

11:04.141 --> 11:06.143
But I really hope
Nate can make it.

11:07.579 --> 11:10.104
[music on MP3 player]

11:16.850 --> 11:18.939
[Anne]
'Nate, here you are. I've been
looking everywhere for you.'

11:19.026 --> 11:21.637
I was up in your room calling
your name for 20 minutes..

11:23.726 --> 11:25.815
Hey, take your earphones out.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.861
Take your earphones out.

11:27.948 --> 11:30.428
Nathaniel, I've been
calling you for 20 minutes.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.387
I'm sorry. What is it?

11:35.346 --> 11:38.262
Blair's birthday party
is tonight, isn't it?

11:38.349 --> 11:39.568
Yeah.

11:39.655 --> 11:40.961
I was thinking maybe

11:41.048 --> 11:42.876
you should give
her something special.

11:42.963 --> 11:44.268
I'm sure she's already
picked out something

11:44.355 --> 11:46.357
at the jewelry store
and put it on hold.

11:46.444 --> 11:49.273
Something more special
than that.

11:51.493 --> 11:53.713
Mom, that's a family heirloom.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.585
I'm not giving it to Blair.

11:56.672 --> 12:00.197
- It's an engagement ring.
- I'm not asking you to propose.

12:00.284 --> 12:01.546
But it's important
that Blair knows

12:01.633 --> 12:03.374
how much you value her loyalty.

12:03.461 --> 12:05.072
Her loyalty or her mother's?

12:05.159 --> 12:06.682
Eleanor's lawyers
may have called.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.249
What difference does it make?

12:08.336 --> 12:09.816
One day we'll all be family

12:09.903 --> 12:11.469
and they won't
have a choice in these matters.

12:11.556 --> 12:15.082
Blair and I broke up last night.

12:15.169 --> 12:18.955
- Well, then get back together.
- I don't think so.

12:19.042 --> 12:21.001
May I remind you
it was your own rash actions

12:21.088 --> 12:22.654
that got us into
this predicament?

12:22.742 --> 12:26.049
We're in this predicament
because dad has a drug problem.

12:26.136 --> 12:29.444
- I was trying to help him
- Then help him.

12:29.531 --> 12:32.969
Your father's acting the way
that he is because he's scared.

12:33.056 --> 12:35.493
He needs you so much right now..

12:35.580 --> 12:37.844
...more than he ever has.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.193
We all do.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.805
Whoever thought
monarchy was dead

12:42.892 --> 12:46.069
didn't realize
it just changed zip codes.

12:46.156 --> 12:47.549
So what will it be, Nate?

12:47.636 --> 12:50.552
Blair Waldorf's hand
or your father's head?

12:54.121 --> 12:55.687
[instrumental music]

13:02.999 --> 13:04.784
[phone ringing]

13:07.482 --> 13:09.571
Hi. Are you okay?

13:09.658 --> 13:10.920
Uh, I've been
texting you all day.

13:11.007 --> 13:12.487
Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.
Thanks.

13:12.574 --> 13:14.315
I, um, just been a little busy.

13:14.402 --> 13:17.274
I just wanted to check on you.
See if you need anything.

13:18.623 --> 13:21.235
- Yeah, I kinda do.
- Oh?

13:21.322 --> 13:24.760
Um...Blair, do you think
we've been a little

13:24.847 --> 13:26.849
a little hasty
with the whole breakup?

13:28.068 --> 13:29.373
I-I don't know, Nate.

13:29.460 --> 13:32.550
Um, it was
a pretty difficult decision.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.509
Yeah, look,
I-I totally understand.

13:34.596 --> 13:37.120
I'm sorry. I, um,
I shouldn't have brought it up.

13:37.207 --> 13:41.342
Uh, but...we do have a lot
of history together.

13:41.429 --> 13:43.344
'It was in the heat
of the moment'

13:43.431 --> 13:47.261
But you'd have to be willing
to really work for it.

13:48.262 --> 13:50.003
Yeah, yeah, of course.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.440
Listen, we'll just take it slow
and see how it goes.

13:52.527 --> 13:55.486
And, um, I've got
a birthday present for you.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.794
It's, uh, something special.

14:01.666 --> 14:04.104
I can't wait
to open it at my party.

14:04.191 --> 14:06.062
- I'll see you there.
- I..

14:11.154 --> 14:13.069
Hi. This is Blair Waldorf.

14:13.156 --> 14:14.679
I was wondering
if any of the pieces

14:14.766 --> 14:18.379
that I put on hold
were picked up today.

14:18.466 --> 14:21.599
The diamond necklace?
Really? Okay.

14:22.557 --> 14:23.732
Thank you.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.476
Thank you!

14:28.563 --> 14:30.826
Thank you. Thank you.

14:34.177 --> 14:36.571
[instrumental music]

14:40.880 --> 14:42.142
Hey.

14:44.535 --> 14:45.928
Can we talk?

14:52.456 --> 14:55.024
Well, that depends.
Are you, are you back for good?

14:55.111 --> 14:56.983
I don't know.

14:57.070 --> 14:59.507
Your father and I haven't
really had a chance to talk so..

14:59.594 --> 15:02.118
Well, do you want
to come back?

15:02.205 --> 15:04.599
Or do you wanna live in Hudson
with, uh, neighbor guy?

15:04.686 --> 15:07.384
Okay, look, Dan, I understand
that you're mad, alright?

15:07.471 --> 15:09.125
And I'm not
gonna defend what I did.

15:09.212 --> 15:12.085
No, you-you don't
get it, do you?

15:12.172 --> 15:14.304
You think I'm only mad
about the cheating?

15:15.827 --> 15:17.438
Okay. What else?

15:18.874 --> 15:20.310
Maybe, that you promised
you would be home

15:20.397 --> 15:22.834
by the end of summer,
and then you weren't.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.662
Maybe, the fact
that you left at all.

15:24.749 --> 15:27.056
I asked if you were okay
with me going away

15:27.143 --> 15:28.753
and I'd hoped
that if there was a problem

15:28.840 --> 15:30.059
you would say something.

15:30.146 --> 15:31.756
Like what?

15:31.843 --> 15:33.323
Your daughter's
a freshman at a school

15:33.410 --> 15:36.413
populated by mean girls
and date rapists?

15:36.500 --> 15:37.937
'I think she needs her mom.'

15:38.024 --> 15:40.678
Or maybe my father is..

15:40.765 --> 15:42.071
...madly in love with you

15:42.158 --> 15:43.986
and will probably
never get over this?

15:49.296 --> 15:51.515
Why should
I have to tell you this?

15:56.390 --> 15:58.870
- Where are you going?
- Out. I'll call later.

16:01.395 --> 16:04.137
Well, that went well.

16:04.224 --> 16:05.486
You know, I was thinking
of going out also.

16:05.573 --> 16:06.966
There's something
I kinda need to do.

16:07.053 --> 16:08.271
- Oh, yeah. You need some help?
- Can I help you?

16:08.358 --> 16:09.751
'No, I'm good. Thanks.'

16:18.542 --> 16:20.631
[knock on door]

16:20.718 --> 16:21.937
Come on, man,
I can hear you breathing

16:22.024 --> 16:24.592
on the other side of the door.

16:24.679 --> 16:27.334
'Is she anybody
you can get rid of?'

16:27.421 --> 16:29.466
'I really need to talk
to you, man. Please.'

16:31.555 --> 16:32.730
Nathaniel.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.038
- Where's the girl?
- In my dreams.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.997
I was trying
to get some shut-eye.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.824
- What's on your mind?
- It's my mom.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.087
Sounds Freudian.

16:44.351 --> 16:45.526
She wants me
to give Blair her ring.

16:45.613 --> 16:48.050
What? You guys broke up.

16:48.137 --> 16:50.705
Yeah, I know, I mean, uh..

16:50.792 --> 16:52.098
Wait. How do you know?

16:52.185 --> 16:54.448
Predictably,
your ex ran the old, uh..

16:54.535 --> 16:56.189
grill-the-best-friend play.

16:56.276 --> 16:59.322
Tried to find out
where your head was at.

16:59.409 --> 17:01.759
So, uh, where, uh..

17:01.846 --> 17:04.371
Where is your head?

17:04.458 --> 17:06.416
Spinning.

17:06.503 --> 17:08.157
'I mean, my mom wants me
to get back with Blair'

17:08.244 --> 17:10.420
so Eleanor doesn't pull out
of their business deal.

17:12.727 --> 17:16.078
It's all because of my dad's
whole trial thing, you know?

17:16.165 --> 17:18.515
Yeah. I'm sorry about all that.

17:18.602 --> 17:21.257
But look, if you're done
with Blair, be done.

17:21.344 --> 17:22.911
Don't cave
to your parents' wishes

17:22.998 --> 17:24.260
if they're not your desires.

17:24.347 --> 17:26.349
Excuse me?
Where's my boy?

17:26.436 --> 17:27.872
"Seal the deal.
Tap that ass.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.352
'Money marries bigger money."'

17:29.439 --> 17:31.311
Look, I care
about three things, Nathaniel.

17:31.398 --> 17:34.705
Money, the pleasures
money brings me and you.

17:34.792 --> 17:37.447
'I'm just trying
to have your back here.'

17:37.534 --> 17:38.970
Your parents have been
controlling you your whole life.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.060
If it doesn't end now,
when will it ever?

17:43.062 --> 17:45.064
[upbeat music]

17:52.549 --> 17:54.943
[singing in foreign language]

18:06.346 --> 18:08.304
[laughing]

18:08.391 --> 18:11.177
- Hey.
- Hi, Serena, Blair.

18:11.264 --> 18:13.570
[both]
Happy birthday.

18:13.657 --> 18:15.964
Oh, my God, Kati, your brother's
place looks fabulous.

18:16.051 --> 18:18.053
- Yeah, I know, right?
- I know. It's incredible.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.794
Come on, guys.
Let's check it out.

18:19.881 --> 18:22.013
[upbeat music]

18:26.844 --> 18:28.803
- Arigatou Gozaimasu.
- Douitashimashite.

18:28.890 --> 18:30.587
Thank you.

18:30.674 --> 18:31.719
Hey. So where's Nate?

18:31.806 --> 18:33.155
Um..

18:33.242 --> 18:35.723
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

18:35.810 --> 18:36.811
What about Dan?

18:36.898 --> 18:38.378
Oh, uh, he said he's coming

18:38.465 --> 18:40.031
but I haven't talked
to him since this morning.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.251
Well, you better
check in on him.

18:42.338 --> 18:43.992
Make sure the best friend
hasn't whisked him away

18:44.079 --> 18:45.298
to do some friendly activity.

18:45.385 --> 18:46.995
Oh, shut up.

18:47.082 --> 18:49.519
Oh, there's Chuck.
I bet he knows where Nate is.

18:49.606 --> 18:51.869
I think Nate probably just
snuck in while we were dancing.

18:51.956 --> 18:53.132
Chuck.

18:59.703 --> 19:00.965
Well, thanks for listening
to me complain

19:01.052 --> 19:02.619
about my family all afternoon.

19:02.706 --> 19:04.752
Oh, look,
I know it's hard right now

19:04.839 --> 19:06.188
but your family
is one of the good ones

19:06.275 --> 19:08.059
and your parents
really love each other.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.365
They'll figure it out

19:09.452 --> 19:11.889
and in the meantime
you've got me.

19:11.976 --> 19:16.242
Um...actually, I was gonna go
meet up with Serena.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.287
Oh, sure.

19:18.374 --> 19:19.680
Have fun.

19:19.767 --> 19:20.811
I will.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.901
What are we doing?

19:23.988 --> 19:26.861
I thought you said
weweren't doing anything.

19:26.948 --> 19:29.168
I like Serena,
and I like you

19:29.255 --> 19:31.474
and she likes me,
and you like me

19:31.561 --> 19:33.041
so how-how can you not
like each other?

19:33.128 --> 19:34.695
It's mathematically impossible.

19:34.782 --> 19:36.784
Who said I didn't like her?
I just don't know her.

19:36.871 --> 19:38.786
Yeah, and you're making
a real effort to change that.

19:38.873 --> 19:42.137
I mean, why spend five minutes
trying to be nice to Serena

19:42.224 --> 19:44.400
when I can spend day after day

19:44.487 --> 19:45.923
forced to choose
between the two of you?

19:46.010 --> 19:48.099
Okay, fine, you wanna
see me get my nice on?

19:48.187 --> 19:51.015
Let's do it tonight.
Just you, me and Serena.

19:52.147 --> 19:54.018
Um..

19:54.105 --> 19:56.978
Tonight-tonight is
Blair Waldorf's birthday party.

19:57.065 --> 19:59.415
Uh, I think we might
want to start by dipping a toe

19:59.502 --> 20:02.331
rather than
diving off of a cliff

20:02.418 --> 20:04.725
headfirst, into the rocks
with the sharks.

20:04.812 --> 20:06.640
Why? We all know how to swim.

20:06.727 --> 20:08.032
Come on.

20:08.119 --> 20:10.470
You wanna do this,
let's do it.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.434
Are you ready for your present?

20:18.521 --> 20:22.612
Ow! If you wanted to play rough,
all you had to do was ask.

20:22.699 --> 20:25.920
- 'Hey, Blair.'
- Hi. Hello there.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.617
Happy birthday to me.

20:29.489 --> 20:30.838
You nauseate me.

20:30.925 --> 20:33.057
All this talk about
how you have to be with Nate

before our fight

and give her this card

just deliver it for me, though?

give you some space.

pretending to like me

and that he's actually
using me to get to my mother?
