00:06.006 --> 00:07.216
(knock on door)

00:07.258 --> 00:09.218
Hello?

00:09.260 --> 00:11.846
(indistinct chatter over radio)

00:11.887 --> 00:13.472
Hello?

00:13.514 --> 00:15.975
Oh, boy.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.227
-You remember me?
-Oh, yeah.

00:18.269 --> 00:20.354
-Long time no see.
-Oh, yes.

00:20.396 --> 00:23.733
Well, I've been very busy.
Traveling.

00:23.774 --> 00:27.361
-You want a slice?
-Oh, no, thank you.

00:27.403 --> 00:28.738
I was just in the neighborhood,

00:28.779 --> 00:30.948
and I thought I would drop in
and say hello.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.992
-To me.
-Yes.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.750
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:40.791 --> 00:43.002
Anything else?

00:43.043 --> 00:45.004
No.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.006
Oh, well, as long as I'm here,

00:47.047 --> 00:50.009
Miriam-- my daughter, remember?

00:50.050 --> 00:54.054
Well, her husband left her,
and she's been living with us,

00:54.096 --> 00:56.182
and recently I found out
that she's...

00:56.223 --> 00:58.184
Aren't you gonna make some tea?

00:58.225 --> 01:00.102
-I don't like tea.
-(chuckles):
The tea isn't for you.

01:00.144 --> 01:01.604
It's for me. I drink it,

01:01.645 --> 01:03.773
-and you read the leaves.
-Don't need it.

01:03.814 --> 01:07.234
Oh, you use the ball, right.
Or cards?

01:07.276 --> 01:09.612
Oh, no, I remember.
You like fire.

01:09.653 --> 01:12.156
Just sit there.

01:12.198 --> 01:14.200
Let me look at you.

01:22.792 --> 01:25.169
Okay. What do you want to know?

01:25.211 --> 01:26.837
Um, well, my d-daughter...

01:26.879 --> 01:28.380
-Miriam.
-Why, yes.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.341
You just told me her name.
Don't get too impressed.

01:30.382 --> 01:34.970
Yes, uh, well, she's, um,
pursuing a career in...

01:35.012 --> 01:37.389
comedy,

01:37.431 --> 01:39.058
which is bad enough in itself,

01:39.099 --> 01:41.811
but there's a very viable man
in the picture now,

01:41.852 --> 01:44.814
and I am so worried that this...

01:44.855 --> 01:48.275
career will be the downfall
of this relationship.

01:48.317 --> 01:49.860
Tell me, what do you see?

01:49.902 --> 01:51.904
Hmm.

01:54.281 --> 01:58.661
I see a perky brunette
with a signature hairstyle.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.830
Oh, that's her. That's Miriam.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.498
She's standing
in front of a big crowd.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.083
A wedding? That's a wedding.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.377
She's the object
of deep adoration.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.546
That's Benjamin.
He'll adore her.

02:08.587 --> 02:10.631
H-He'll be weirdly subtle
about it

02:10.673 --> 02:12.383
and do it in
a slightly robotic way, but...

02:12.424 --> 02:14.468
I see her talking.

02:14.510 --> 02:17.721
Speaking very quickly
into a microphone.

02:17.763 --> 02:19.557
That's her speech. She gave
a speech at her first wedding,

02:19.598 --> 02:21.517
and she's doing it again.
Oh, I'm so...

02:21.559 --> 02:23.185
Does she mention shrimp?

02:23.227 --> 02:24.770
-What?
-Never mind. Who cares?

02:24.812 --> 02:26.772
She's getting married.
Oh, I'm so glad

02:26.814 --> 02:29.692
I just happened to be strolling
by here with no intention

02:29.733 --> 02:31.652
of coming in at all,
and then I did. Oh, here.

02:32.695 --> 02:34.822
Thank you.

02:34.864 --> 02:38.117
Thank you so much.
I'll see you next week.

02:38.158 --> 02:41.453
There's gonna be a wedding.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.455
(chuckles)

02:44.498 --> 02:46.250
I don't know why you'd wear

02:46.292 --> 02:50.170
a black cocktail dress
to a wedding, but...

02:50.212 --> 02:52.214
whatever.

02:55.050 --> 02:58.012
(announcer shouting over radio)

02:58.053 --> 03:00.347
-What time is it?
-Early. 9:00, 10:00.

03:00.389 --> 03:03.475
-12:30. I should go.
-Really? You bored?

03:03.517 --> 03:05.394
I'm supposed to be
in my dorm room by midnight.

03:05.436 --> 03:07.396
This is the third time this week
I've missed curfew.

03:07.438 --> 03:09.106
Third time this week
I'll have to climb in my window

03:09.148 --> 03:11.191
-to avoid getting caught.
-I thought your curfew was 1:00.

03:11.233 --> 03:12.985
-You did not.
-Yeah.

03:13.027 --> 03:15.112
I just like watching you climb
in that window.

03:15.154 --> 03:17.740
Hey, we saw them tonight.
We saw you tonight.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.033
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

03:19.074 --> 03:20.200
-Good or bad?
-Great.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.577
Especially the last number.

03:21.619 --> 03:23.370
Told you we needed
that last number.

03:23.412 --> 03:25.998
-You're impossible.
-Impossible and right.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.750
-We should go.
-You know, I'm tired

03:27.791 --> 03:29.335
of having to take you home
at night.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.337
-I can just grab a cab, then.
-Not what I meant.

03:31.378 --> 03:34.173
-Horse and buggy? Magic carpet?
-Don't go back to your dorm.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.383
-Where am I supposed to go?
-My dorm.

03:36.425 --> 03:39.053
Oh, now, Mr. Maisel,
you know good girls

03:39.094 --> 03:41.013
don't stay out all night
with their gentlemen callers.

03:41.055 --> 03:43.265
I mean, what would
the neighbors think?

03:43.307 --> 03:44.975
That you're a dime-store floozy?

03:45.017 --> 03:46.894
Dime-store? In these shoes?

03:46.936 --> 03:50.230
Well, if you won't let me
sully your reputation,

03:50.272 --> 03:53.108

make an honest woman out of you.

Right here, these are
last year's financials,

06:44.571 --> 06:46.073
tax returns, bank statements.

06:46.115 --> 06:47.783
As you can see,
I can clearly provide for her.

06:47.825 --> 06:49.660
Anything she needs,
anything the children need,

06:49.701 --> 06:51.370
they will be very comfortable.

06:51.411 --> 06:55.082
So you want to marry
my daughter.

06:55.124 --> 06:57.376
With your permission, yes, I do.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.838
-And you've spent time
with Miriam.
-I have.

07:00.879 --> 07:03.215
-So you understand Miriam.
-I do.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.342
Could you explain her to me?

07:05.384 --> 07:08.262
-That was a joke, Benjamin.
-Right, sorry.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.973
Humor is very important
in our house, Benjamin.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.142
-Of course.
-If you are going
to marry Miriam,

07:13.183 --> 07:14.852
-you will have to learn that.
-I understand.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.520
Because to Miriam,
almost everything in the world

07:16.562 --> 07:19.690
is a joke. I had to stop
watching the news with her.

07:19.731 --> 07:21.441

a lot of closet space.

07:30.993 --> 07:33.495
-I have seen the hats.
-There will be
a lot of activity.

07:33.537 --> 07:35.122
Things will shift quickly.

07:35.164 --> 07:38.167
Your reality,
your vacation plans.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.127
And God knows what
those children will be like

07:40.169 --> 07:42.045
when they grow up.
I cannot vouch for them.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.131
I will not hold you responsible.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.341
It's awfully quick,
your courtship.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.927
Anything I should know that will
certainly kill her mother?

07:48.969 --> 07:51.430
No. I've just waited a long time

07:51.471 --> 07:53.015
and now I have. That's all.

07:53.056 --> 07:57.102
ABE: Well, if this
is truly your intention,

07:57.144 --> 07:59.104
in addition to the bank records,

07:59.146 --> 08:03.025
I will need
25 character references.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.902

08:08.488 --> 08:11.408
how religious you are,
what your hobbies are,

08:11.450 --> 08:14.703
what percentage of time
you spend on such hobbies,

08:14.745 --> 08:16.705
are you a dog or a cat man--

08:16.747 --> 08:19.583
very important--
your favorite authors.

08:19.625 --> 08:22.628
You see, Benjamin,
after the Joel fiasco,

08:22.669 --> 08:24.046
I am taking this decision

08:24.087 --> 08:25.672
very, very seriously.

08:26.715 --> 08:29.426
You have somewhere else to be?

08:29.468 --> 08:32.012
No. Well, surgery.

08:32.054 --> 08:34.139
But never mind. Go on.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.225
I'll need to know
all political affiliations,

08:36.266 --> 08:37.476
favorite baseball team,

08:37.517 --> 08:38.977
favorite radio shows...

08:39.019 --> 08:41.146
Mr. Weissman,
could you excuse me a minute?

08:41.188 --> 08:42.981
I need to use the bathroom.

08:43.023 --> 08:46.443
Oh. That's something you do?

08:46.485 --> 08:48.487
Yes.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.530
All right. If you must.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.162
Oh.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.500
-What was that for?
-I just needed to make sure

09:01.541 --> 09:03.377
-you're worth all this.
-I am.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.420
God, this is much harder
than I thought it was gonna be.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.714
My father's a complicated man.
But once this is over,

09:07.756 --> 09:09.091
you guys are going to be
very close.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.134
-It will never be over.
-It will be.

09:11.176 --> 09:12.970
Four patients have already died
this morning.

09:13.011 --> 09:15.514
-A small price to pay.
-I thought
we were making progress

09:15.555 --> 09:17.140
when we stumbled
onto the Big Bang theory.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.184
How do you stumble
onto the Big Bang theory?

09:19.226 --> 09:21.186
And then he asked
if I snack in between meals.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.854
-You said no, right?
-I said it depends.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.107
-Oh, dear.
-It does. It's snacking.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.858
There's no plan.
That's what makes it snacking.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.444
Okay, relax. You're doing fine.
And get back in there.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.071
If he thinks you're taking
too long in the bathroom,

09:31.113 --> 09:32.406
there will be
a very thorough physical

09:32.447 --> 09:34.449
-in your future.
-Bye.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.120
Is this how you look
in the morning?

09:38.161 --> 09:39.705
Yes, it is.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.124
I'll never make it
to work on time again.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.251
-I'm back.
-ABE:
That was quick. Good for you.

09:44.293 --> 09:46.211
Get these downstairs
to accounting now

09:46.253 --> 09:48.005
-or no one gets paid.
-ALL: What?!

09:48.046 --> 09:50.257
Everyone's getting paid!
It's an expression.

09:50.299 --> 09:52.884
-Get back to work.
-Mr. Maisel, phone.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.511
The Dutch fabric shipment's
gone missing.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.263
How does a truckload of fabric
go missing?

09:56.305 --> 09:58.265
-Joel, are we on for tonight?
-I have the kids tonight.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.225
-I love kids.
-Great. Go have some.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.853
-Never mind, they found it.
-Where?

10:02.894 --> 10:05.105
Times Square.
The driver had an audition.

10:05.147 --> 10:07.357
Get the shipment,
fire the driver. In that order.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.026
Okay, see, when I gave you

10:09.067 --> 10:11.403
that giant amount of money
to go away,

10:11.445 --> 10:14.239
-I expected you to go away.
-I don't have time
right now, Pop.

10:14.281 --> 10:17.409
I fired you, and you responded
by bringing your children here.

10:17.451 --> 10:20.495
Is that hostile or adorable?
I just can't tell.

10:20.537 --> 10:23.081
I'll go. I'm going.
I just have to figure out where.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.583
In the meantime, Mrs. Moskowitz,

10:24.624 --> 10:25.959
when is the Joseph Miller
meeting again?

10:26.001 --> 10:27.544
-4:45.
-4:45?

10:27.586 --> 10:29.171
That's what he said, 4:45.

10:29.212 --> 10:31.089
Hey, what are you drawing there,
Ethan?

10:31.131 --> 10:33.258
Mommy's friend. Bathroom!

10:33.300 --> 10:36.386
Mr. Maisel, I am not cleaning
that bathroom again.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.138
I got it, Mrs. Moskowitz.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.807
He's like a sprung garden hose,
that child.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.893
-Mommy's got a friend.
-Fuck you.

10:42.934 --> 10:45.771
Aha, baby's first swear word.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.939
Definitely not her first.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.652
What is your life, anyhow?

10:52.694 --> 10:55.113
JOEL:
Ethan!

10:55.155 --> 10:57.449
Remember, pal, you have to look
where you're aiming

10:57.491 --> 10:59.326
-when you use the urinal.
-Why?

10:59.368 --> 11:02.204
Because if you keep hitting
the floor and the counter

11:02.245 --> 11:05.040
and the ceiling,
no girl's ever gonna marry you,

11:05.082 --> 11:06.625
and Mrs. Moskowitz
is gonna leave your daddy,

11:06.666 --> 11:08.168
so we'll both be alone.

11:08.210 --> 11:11.338
Hey. So, Mommy has
a new friend, huh?

11:11.380 --> 11:13.048
-Yeah.
-And you met him?

11:13.090 --> 11:14.633
-Yeah.
-Where?

11:14.674 --> 11:15.842
At the park.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.554
I thought you had to go
to the bathroom.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.598
ETHAN:
Not fun now!

11:23.642 --> 11:26.645
-This one?
-Second wedding.

11:30.232 --> 11:33.235
-This one?
-Second wedding.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.280
-This one.
-Miriam, please.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.616
You can't wear white.
It's a second wedding.

11:39.658 --> 11:42.619
-You can wear champagne.
-I don't want to wear champagne.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.955
It's not a color. It's what
happens when white gets sad.

11:44.996 --> 11:48.083
Well, I'm sorry. Second weddings
are subtle, dignified.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.544
No big halls or lavish dinners.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.629
Second weddings mean 40 guests

11:52.671 --> 11:54.589
and a luncheon at home
with scrambled eggs.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.216
Wow.
What's the third wedding mean?

11:56.258 --> 11:57.676
Third wedding means I'm dead.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.719
-Can I wear white?
-Keep looking, please.

11:59.761 --> 12:01.513
There may not even be a wedding
at this rate.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.306
Papa still hasn't said yes.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.766
Plus, he said
if he does say yes,

12:04.808 --> 12:06.810
-he's not gonna pay for it.
-Yes, he will.

12:06.852 --> 12:09.563
He'll pay for a second wedding
here at home with scrambled...

12:09.604 --> 12:11.690
Scrambled eggs
and a champagne dress.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.442
Oh, now cheer up.
You can still give a toast.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.485
I know you have your heart set
on giving a toast.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.028
-How do you know that?
-Ladies.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.697
Papa. Hi!

12:18.738 --> 12:21.199
There's a sandwich for you
in the refrigerator, Abe.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.869
Papa? Hey, Papa?

12:23.910 --> 12:25.704
Papa? Papa?

12:25.745 --> 12:27.747
Miriam, do you get paid
by the "Papa"?

12:27.789 --> 12:29.916
-No.
-(sighs)

12:29.958 --> 12:33.003
-So, Papa...
-Pickles.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.130
I was just wondering
if you've thought any more

12:35.172 --> 12:36.673
about your talk with Benjamin?

12:36.715 --> 12:39.217
-No.
-No? Just no?

12:39.259 --> 12:41.428
No. Yes, no.

12:41.470 --> 12:44.097
Well, you know from experience,
the sooner you book a hall,

12:44.139 --> 12:45.557
the better deal you get.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.392
ROSE:
No hall! Second wedding!

12:47.434 --> 12:49.352
I do not have an answer yet.

12:49.394 --> 12:52.022
Well, is there anything
you want to talk about with me?

12:52.063 --> 12:54.232
-No.
-Anything I can tell you?

12:54.274 --> 12:56.735
-No. Wait. Yes.
-Great. What?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.737
Do you ever call him Ben?

12:58.778 --> 13:00.739
-No.
-Benny?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.824
-No.
-Dr. Ben?

13:02.866 --> 13:04.784
-No.
-Okay.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.912
Thank you for that information.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.915
Papa? Papa...

13:09.956 --> 13:12.375
For a woman who wants to make
her fortune on the stage,

13:12.417 --> 13:14.252
you have
an extremely limited vocabulary.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.837
Why won't you give
your permission?

13:15.879 --> 13:17.672
I didn't say
I wouldn't give my permission.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.341
I just said
I haven't decided yet.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.926
Well, what's taking you so long?

13:20.967 --> 13:22.886
I have to run his numbers again.

13:22.928 --> 13:24.513
I don't think
his figures add up.

13:24.554 --> 13:26.181
It's not fair to make him wait.

13:26.223 --> 13:27.891
Well, if he doesn't like it,

13:27.933 --> 13:30.310
he can go ahead and marry you
without my permission.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.062
Joel did.
That turned out great.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.606
Forget it.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.483
When I've decided, you'll know.

13:36.525 --> 13:38.527
-Fine.
-I'll send up a flare.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.570
Super.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.489
Miriam, wait.

13:42.531 --> 13:44.866
I need to ask you something.

13:47.911 --> 13:50.455
What did you say in Washington?

13:50.497 --> 13:52.582
What did I say about what?

13:52.624 --> 13:55.502
In your club date--
what did you say about...

13:55.544 --> 13:57.212
about me?

13:57.254 --> 13:59.214
Papa, I swear,
that night in the Catskills

13:59.256 --> 14:01.466
was a total
and complete anomaly.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.802
-So you didn't talk
about me at all?
-I did not.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.221
Cross my heart and swear to God
on the life of my kids.

14:06.263 --> 14:08.557
-Oh, wait.
-You did talk about me.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.350
-Just a little.
-What did you say?

14:10.392 --> 14:12.936
-It's very important
that I know.
-I said,

14:12.978 --> 14:14.563
"Is Senator Kennedy
running for president?

14:14.604 --> 14:16.523
"It's up to Jackie.
You know she wears the pants

14:16.565 --> 14:18.358
-in that family."
-No, she doesn't.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.818
Well, I haven't gotten
to the part about the linen.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.236
-What linen?
-Her pants are linen.

14:21.278 --> 14:23.113
-Who cares what fabric they are?
-No.

14:23.154 --> 14:25.657
The whole point of the bit is
she wears linen pants,

14:25.699 --> 14:27.450
and they wrinkle
while you're ironing them.

14:27.492 --> 14:30.078
You know, you don't seem to be
getting any better at this.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.871
-Let me start again.
-Please don't.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.915
Just skip to the part about me.

14:33.957 --> 14:37.377
I said, I found you listening
to my four-year-old's record,

14:37.419 --> 14:39.671
a song about teaching yourself

14:39.713 --> 14:41.840
to wipe your, uh... tushie,
after going to the bathroom,

14:41.881 --> 14:44.217
and you said you were listening
to it, because at work,

14:44.259 --> 14:46.011
you're trying
to teach a computer to sing.

14:46.052 --> 14:49.472
And what was the punch line?

14:49.514 --> 14:51.808
Now I'm wondering,
does my father not know

14:51.850 --> 14:53.810
-how to go to the bathroom?
-Okay.

14:53.852 --> 14:55.812
-And if that's true,
who taught me?
-I get it.

14:55.854 --> 14:57.772
-Because my mother never goes
to the bathroom.
-That's enough.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.566
-I heard my name!
-No, you didn't.

14:59.608 --> 15:01.860
What else did you say?
About Bell Labs?

15:01.901 --> 15:04.446
-About the work there?
-Nothing.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.698
No specifics about what I do?

15:06.740 --> 15:09.117
I don't know what you do.
I've never known what you do.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.661
Most of the time, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:11.703 --> 15:14.122
I have no idea why we're having
this conversation right now.

15:14.164 --> 15:16.124
All right.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.168
I believe you.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.427
We haven't finished
our Benjamin conversation yet.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.179
-Yes, we have.
-I want an answer.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.598
-Okay. No.
-You're right. Take your time.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.269
-What do you think?
-I think it's a piece of shit.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.980
That's the eighth chair
you said was a piece of shit.

15:39.022 --> 15:41.524
I believe all eight are
genuinely a piece of shit.

15:41.566 --> 15:44.277
Jackie, we can't throw out
every fucking chair.

15:44.319 --> 15:46.696
Now, just tell me, what can
you fix and what can't you fix?

15:46.738 --> 15:48.448
-Fix?
-Repair.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.325
-Me?
-Yeah, you.

15:50.367 --> 15:52.035
Who told you
I can fix anything?

15:52.077 --> 15:53.703
I thought you were a carpenter.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.413
Who the fuck told you that?

15:55.455 --> 15:57.582
Isn't that what you did
before you worked here?

15:57.624 --> 16:00.251
No! Oh, wait.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.088
Yes, I did. I am a carpenter.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.423
So can you fix these?

16:05.465 --> 16:07.217
Absolutely.

16:07.258 --> 16:08.968
(phone ringing)

16:09.010 --> 16:10.679
What?

16:10.720 --> 16:13.765
I just... Never mind.

16:17.102 --> 16:18.561
Gaslight.

16:18.603 --> 16:20.313
-WOMAN: Susie Myerson?
-Yeah?

16:20.355 --> 16:22.190
I'm calling
on behalf of Sophie Lennon.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.192
-Oh, shit.
-Excuse me?

16:24.234 --> 16:28.071
I, um... I'm bleeding.
Uh, could I call you back?

16:28.113 --> 16:29.656
Miss Lennon
requests your presence

16:29.698 --> 16:31.866
at her house this Friday,
1:00 sharp.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.326
-What? Why?
-She is requesting it.

16:33.368 --> 16:34.994
Friday, 1:00 sharp.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.746
Uh, Friday's not really good
for me.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.707
My mistake.
She is demanding your presence

16:38.748 --> 16:40.709
at her house Friday, 1:00 sharp.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.585
-But...
-215 East 98th Street.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.796
Eat before you come.
Lunch will not be served.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.172
-Wait!
-(line clicks)

16:46.214 --> 16:48.133
-(sighs)
-(dial tone)

16:48.174 --> 16:50.009
(upbeat jazz music playing)

16:50.051 --> 16:52.053
That was Sophie Lennon
summoning me to her house.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.222
Can you believe that?
After what Harry Drake did?

16:54.264 --> 16:56.391
After what she did to Midge?
Is she crazy?

16:56.433 --> 16:58.601
-You got to go.
-What do you mean, I got to go?

16:58.643 --> 17:00.395
-No way.
-You fucked up.

17:00.437 --> 17:02.522
You went off,
you made things worse.

17:02.564 --> 17:06.651
Now you got to go eat some shit
to make things right for Midge.

17:06.693 --> 17:07.902
Midge wouldn't want me
to eat shit.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.612
Doesn't matter what she wants.

17:09.654 --> 17:12.490
You're the manager. You go to do
what's best for your client.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.659
I don't like this side
of you, Jackie.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.036
-What side?
-Rational. It's freaking me out.

17:17.078 --> 17:21.166
Look, one thing I know about,
even more than carpentry,

17:21.207 --> 17:24.002
and this is
from personal experience--

17:24.043 --> 17:27.380
in life, sometimes you got
to eat a whole lot of shit.

17:27.422 --> 17:30.842
Piles of it.
More shit than you can imagine.

17:30.884 --> 17:33.970
If you took a pack of wolves
with stomach issues,

17:34.012 --> 17:36.097
and locked them
in your apartment for a month,

17:36.139 --> 17:38.016
and then came home with a spoon,

17:38.057 --> 17:40.435
that's the amount of shit
I'm talking about.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.020
Thank you for the vivid imagery.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.397
Life is basically
an all-you-can-eat shit show.

17:44.439 --> 17:46.941
-You're disgusting.
-Yup, but I'm right.

17:49.861 --> 17:53.114
Hey, I fixed it.
How the fuck do you like that?

17:53.156 --> 17:55.158
(Jackie chuckles)

17:57.076 --> 17:59.913
Joel? It's me. Can I come in?

17:59.954 --> 18:01.831
(Esther babbles)

18:01.873 --> 18:03.917
(Esther shouts)

18:03.958 --> 18:05.710
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.086
Ethan, grab your bag.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.838
-Your mother's here.
-Everything okay?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.256
You were supposed
to be here at 6:00.

18:10.298 --> 18:11.800
I know. I'm sorry.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.468
They are both fed,
but Ethan's decided

18:13.510 --> 18:15.595
he wants an additional
bedtime meal, so you figure out

18:15.637 --> 18:18.056
what the hell that means
so I can be prepared next time.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.599
-Joel...
-Bye, pal.

18:19.641 --> 18:21.643
-See you in a few days.
-Joel, what's the matter?

18:21.684 --> 18:23.394
-Nothing.
-Why are you giving me
the brush-off?

18:23.436 --> 18:25.063
I'm not giving you
the brush-off.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.190
I have to work, you have to go.
Case closed.

18:27.232 --> 18:29.108
Okay, but...

18:29.150 --> 18:31.778
Okay, I'll drop them off
on Friday.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.822
-Yup.
-Come on.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.701
I heard about Ethan meeting
your new friend at the park.

18:38.743 --> 18:42.330
-Oh, Joel...
-You know, I have friends, too.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.916
Maybe I should introduce them
to the kids at the park.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.835
I'm sorry. It was a mistake.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.920
Mama told him we were there.
I didn't invite him.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.380
Those are my children, Midge.

18:50.421 --> 18:52.090
I have a right
to know who's meeting them.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.967
-I agree. I told him that.
-Oh, you did? When?

18:54.008 --> 18:56.386
When he showed up. I told him
that you didn't know about it,

18:56.427 --> 18:58.263
and I needed to tell you
before I introduced them.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.681
This is bullshit.

18:59.722 --> 19:02.016
-I thought we were playing nice.
-We are.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.726
My kids!

19:03.768 --> 19:05.603
Mine! I should be informed

19:05.645 --> 19:07.522
before you hand them over
to another man.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.774
I didn't hand them over
to another man.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.110
He showed up by accident.
It was not intentional.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.028
Don't make this a thing.

19:14.070 --> 19:16.364
It is a thing!
It's a big fu...

19:17.824 --> 19:19.909
I have to work.
You have to go.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.369
You're being unreasonable.

19:21.411 --> 19:23.454
Oh, am I?
Well, you should leave me then.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.873
Oh, wait.

19:24.914 --> 19:27.041
I didn't leave you. You left me!

19:27.083 --> 19:29.460
And then you left me back!
Figuratively speaking.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.337
-Bye.
-Bye!

19:35.341 --> 19:38.136
ETHAN:
We used a urinal.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.346
JOEL: She's got a friend,
a fucking...

19:40.388 --> 19:42.348
-friend!
-I hate friends.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.142
Kids have all sorts of friends.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.227
"Come meet my kids.
We're in the park."

19:46.269 --> 19:48.938
Three kids.
It's a lot of friends.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.481
They're my kids, asshole.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.025
My kids!

19:52.066 --> 19:54.152
Your two kids.
I've got three.

19:54.193 --> 19:57.280
Three kids, same income!

19:57.322 --> 19:58.907
"It was an accident."

19:58.948 --> 20:00.491
Accident, my ass.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.452
Accidents happen all the time,

20:02.493 --> 20:06.247
especially after four Rob Roys,
hence... three kids!

20:06.289 --> 20:08.458
You know what? I'm done.

20:08.499 --> 20:12.045
Me, too. I don't care
what Imogene's mother says.

20:12.086 --> 20:13.588
(grunting)

20:13.630 --> 20:16.591
I know I fucked up, okay?

20:16.633 --> 20:19.594
I fucked up! I get it!

20:19.636 --> 20:21.721
And I've been paying
for it for a year.

20:21.763 --> 20:23.348
No more.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.350
She wants to live her life?
Great.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.851
I get to live mine, too.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.395
Well, someone should,
'cause it won't be me.

20:29.437 --> 20:31.189
Three kids!

20:31.230 --> 20:33.232
My mother of all people-- she
told me to stop waiting around.

20:33.274 --> 20:35.568
Well, here you go, Ma. You win!

20:35.610 --> 20:37.278
Mothers always win.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.197
Three kids!

20:39.238 --> 20:41.407
She's not the only one
who gets a dream.

20:41.449 --> 20:43.368
I'm gonna have a dream.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.620
My dream?

20:45.662 --> 20:48.206
A really empty house.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.919
(grunting)

20:52.961 --> 20:54.629
(panting)

20:54.671 --> 20:57.215
You know, when I was a kid,

20:57.256 --> 20:59.217
there was this place
down by the tracks.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.927
A real shithole gin joint.

21:00.969 --> 21:02.637
The place barely had a roof,

21:02.679 --> 21:04.597
-but they got some great
musicians to play there.
-Yeah?

21:04.639 --> 21:06.391
Louis Armstrong
stopped by one night.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.309
Blew the fucking roof
off the place.

21:08.351 --> 21:10.979
The owner, Mario--
he let me hang out there.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.356
Threw me a couple of bucks
if I ran errands,

21:13.398 --> 21:15.108
bought the guys cigarettes,

21:15.149 --> 21:17.568
hauled some beer crates
out of the cellar.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.780
I loved that place.

21:20.822 --> 21:23.241
(siren wailing in distance)

21:24.492 --> 21:26.327
Maybe it wasn't the comedy.

21:26.369 --> 21:28.079
What do you mean?

21:28.121 --> 21:31.499
Clearly, I'm not funny,
but maybe it was the club life,

21:31.541 --> 21:33.251
the club scene,
maybe that's what I loved.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.420
I have to say,
I always thought you were funny.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.046
-Archie.
-You always make me laugh.

21:37.088 --> 21:39.132
Your impression
of your Uncle Moe slays me.

21:39.173 --> 21:41.426
I'm talking professional funny.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.052
Midge funny.

21:43.094 --> 21:45.555
Oh. Well, yeah,
you're definitely not that.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.808
I think I'm gonna do it.

21:48.850 --> 21:51.811
I think I'm gonna open a club.

21:51.853 --> 21:53.855
(car horn honks)

21:59.819 --> 22:01.529
(grunting)

22:01.571 --> 22:03.489
(panting)

22:03.531 --> 22:06.492
I guess now we have
to pick up all those balls?

22:06.534 --> 22:08.286
Yup.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.413
Probably should have thought
about that before we started.

22:10.455 --> 22:13.624
So many things we should have
thought about before we started.

22:23.051 --> 22:25.094
♪ ♪

22:31.350 --> 22:36.189
Charles, I'd like to talk to you
in the secure room... now.

22:40.443 --> 22:42.403
(buzzer sounds)

22:42.445 --> 22:45.656
I'm very busy, Abe, so
we'll need to make this brief.

22:45.698 --> 22:49.035
I talked to my daughter Miriam
about your concerns,

22:49.077 --> 22:50.661
and I can assure you...

22:50.703 --> 22:52.288
(buzzer sounds)

22:52.330 --> 22:53.831
Abe, you remember
Martin Cummings.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.541
He's with our Government
Liaison Department.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.585
-Hello, Abe.
-Yes, hello, Martin.

22:57.627 --> 22:59.712
-But, Charles, we don't need...
-(buzzer sounds)

22:59.754 --> 23:03.049
Abe, you remember Bob Jackson,
head of our in-house counsel.

23:03.091 --> 23:04.592
Yes. Hello, Bob.

23:04.634 --> 23:06.844
But, Charles, what I want
to say doesn't require...

23:06.886 --> 23:08.471
(buzzer sounds)

23:08.513 --> 23:10.765
And, of course,
Devlin Mclaine, obviously.

23:10.807 --> 23:12.266
He's here as a witness.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.310
(buzzer sounds)

23:15.603 --> 23:17.605
They must have buzzed
the wrong room.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.526
We're done.

23:21.567 --> 23:24.278
Okay. As I was saying,

23:24.320 --> 23:26.739
I talked to Miriam,
and she told me...

23:26.781 --> 23:28.282
(clearing throats)

23:28.324 --> 23:30.326
(chairs squeaking on floor)

23:33.037 --> 23:36.249
She did not say anything

23:36.290 --> 23:39.377
about any project
we are working on here.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.170
She made a joke

23:41.212 --> 23:44.632
about the record I was playing
at home, and that is all.

23:44.674 --> 23:46.050
She's a comedian.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.136
They humiliate their families
onstage.

23:48.177 --> 23:50.012
That's their job.

23:50.054 --> 23:51.931
So, no harm was done.

23:51.973 --> 23:54.725
Okay?

23:54.767 --> 23:56.727
We don't see it that way, Abe.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.688
Clearly, she knew
you were working on something.

23:58.729 --> 24:01.232
-I'm always working
on something.
-At the very least,

24:01.274 --> 24:02.733
-you were extremely...
-Loose-lipped.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.443
Extremely loose-lipped
about the situation.

24:04.485 --> 24:06.529
-We don't like loose lips.
-They sink ships.

24:06.571 --> 24:08.239
I've heard the phrase.

24:08.281 --> 24:10.241
CHARLES: Why were you even
listening to this album at home?

24:10.283 --> 24:11.576
Don't you have access
to a bunker

24:11.617 --> 24:13.119
or a bomb shelter of some sort?

24:13.161 --> 24:14.871
You can't be serious.

24:14.912 --> 24:16.539
You played the album
in front of your daughter.

24:16.581 --> 24:18.708
You then confirmed to her
that you were indeed working

24:18.749 --> 24:20.585
on a Bell Labs
government project.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.253
That alone puts you
in breach of contract.

24:22.295 --> 24:24.005
So, not only are you
a security risk,

24:24.046 --> 24:25.381
your daughter is one as well.

24:25.423 --> 24:26.549
She might want
to retain a lawyer.

24:26.591 --> 24:28.467
-CHARLES: A good one.
-She's a comedian.

24:28.509 --> 24:29.886
And a girl.

24:29.927 --> 24:32.305
What kind of risk
could she possibly be?

24:32.346 --> 24:34.390
If I told you that,
then I would be a security risk.

24:34.432 --> 24:37.059
And if I listen to that,
then I would be a security risk.

24:37.101 --> 24:39.562
You came to me, remember?

24:39.604 --> 24:43.191
You came to Columbia
and-and begged me to come here

24:43.232 --> 24:44.775
and give you my expertise.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.110
And I did.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.279
And now you treat me
like a criminal?

24:48.321 --> 24:52.366
Well, I can take that expertise
back as fast as I gave it.

24:52.408 --> 24:53.784
Think about that.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.203
You signed away
your intellectual property

24:55.244 --> 24:56.662
when you signed your contract.

24:56.704 --> 24:58.164
We own your expertise.

24:58.206 --> 24:59.999
You can't own my expertise!

25:00.041 --> 25:01.167
It's mine!

25:01.209 --> 25:03.961
I think you should leave now.

25:09.884 --> 25:12.345
When I was a young man,

25:12.386 --> 25:15.348
I marched against people
like you.

25:15.389 --> 25:20.186
People in coats
with tags and secret bunkers.

25:20.228 --> 25:22.688
I was gonna fight you,
bring you down,

25:22.730 --> 25:24.440
make the world a better place.

25:24.482 --> 25:27.693
I don't know how I got
so far off that track,

25:27.735 --> 25:29.695
but you better believe
I am going

25:29.737 --> 25:32.448
to start retracing my steps
right now.

25:32.490 --> 25:35.701
And if you ever threaten
my daughter again,

25:35.743 --> 25:37.703
I will punch you
right in the nose.

25:37.745 --> 25:39.705
It won't hurt.
I'm not strong.

25:39.747 --> 25:42.458
But, at the very least,
you will be embarrassed

25:42.500 --> 25:46.545
that you got punched in the nose
by a not-strong mathematician.

25:46.587 --> 25:49.465
You really want to mess with me?

25:49.507 --> 25:51.300
Go ahead.

25:51.342 --> 25:53.135
Take your best shot.

25:53.177 --> 25:58.724
And then you will find out what
Abe Weissman is truly made of.

26:03.980 --> 26:06.691
You're going
to have to buzz me out.

26:06.732 --> 26:09.151
(buzzer sounds)

26:10.903 --> 26:13.614
-It's a girl!
-It's a girl.

26:13.656 --> 26:15.116
Oh! Can I hug you?

26:15.157 --> 26:16.367
I just had a shot.

26:16.409 --> 26:18.035
Congratulations.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.954
Millie. We called her Millie.

26:19.996 --> 26:21.789
-Aw.
-Millicent, after
Archie's someone or other.

26:21.831 --> 26:23.791
But Millicent, ugh. So, Millie!

26:23.833 --> 26:25.543
Millie is beautiful.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.545
What's he doing there?

26:27.586 --> 26:28.671
IMOGENE:
He was so nervous that Joel

26:28.713 --> 26:29.880
took him to a bar to relax him

26:29.922 --> 26:30.923
and brought him back like that.

26:30.965 --> 26:32.550
He fell and got
two stitches in his head.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.551
He just doesn't know it yet.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.219
With Esther, Joel broke an arm.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.305
Men are really terrible at this.

26:37.346 --> 26:38.889
You want to see her?

26:38.931 --> 26:41.183
Well, I certainly didn't
come here to see you.

26:42.768 --> 26:45.730
-Oh, Imogene, she's perfect.
-Isn't she?

26:45.771 --> 26:47.982
-Boy or girl?
-IMOGENE/MIDGE: Girl.

26:48.024 --> 26:50.318
Girl? Really?

26:50.359 --> 26:51.610
-You knew that, Archie.
-(fussing)

26:51.652 --> 26:54.322
-Can I hold her?
-Well, someone should.

26:54.363 --> 26:55.823
(fussing)

26:55.865 --> 26:57.950
Hello, Millie.

26:57.992 --> 26:59.410
Millie? Really?

26:59.452 --> 27:00.578
You named her, Archie.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.330
I'm Miriam.

27:02.371 --> 27:04.332
You can call me Midge.

27:04.373 --> 27:06.625
We're gonna be great friends.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.419
Hey, don't I have
an Aunt Millicent?

27:08.461 --> 27:10.212
Go get some coffee, Archie.

27:10.254 --> 27:13.215
See, now, if for some reason
things don't work out

27:13.257 --> 27:15.968
with Ethan and Estelle,
then he can marry Millie.

27:16.010 --> 27:17.303
MIDGE:
Her first hand-me-down.

27:17.345 --> 27:18.637
Hey, what happened to my head?

27:18.679 --> 27:21.057
Oh, Midge, you have got
to have another baby.

27:21.098 --> 27:23.267
-We always have them together.
-I know.

27:23.309 --> 27:24.685
Don't you want another one?

27:24.727 --> 27:26.937
Well, I have
two pretty good ones right now.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.606
I know.
But when they're new...

27:28.647 --> 27:30.191
Fresh out of the drawer...

27:30.232 --> 27:31.442
There's nothing like it.

27:31.484 --> 27:32.610
ARCHIE:
Do I have stitches?

27:32.651 --> 27:33.861
Archie, coffee.

27:33.903 --> 27:35.863
Okay.

27:35.905 --> 27:37.782
So...

27:37.823 --> 27:39.283
tell me where you stand.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.035
-What do you mean?
-Benjamin.

27:41.077 --> 27:44.038
Is he in or out? Because,
on paper, he seems perfect.

27:44.080 --> 27:45.581
Off paper, too.

27:45.623 --> 27:46.999
If you hurry and get married,

27:47.041 --> 27:49.168
we can still take our stroller
walks in the park together.

27:49.210 --> 27:51.003
Oh, I love those walks.

27:51.045 --> 27:53.214
One more peek.

27:53.255 --> 27:54.632
(knocking)

27:54.673 --> 27:56.801
(exhales)
Hi, Midge.

27:56.842 --> 27:59.470
I'm getting, uh...

27:59.512 --> 28:01.138
uh...

28:01.180 --> 28:03.933
-Huh.
-(Millie fussing)

28:05.643 --> 28:08.437
That's your daddy.

28:08.479 --> 28:10.439
(audience laughing)

28:10.481 --> 28:11.982
No, but my wife is great.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.610
But, get this,
she's jealous of our toilet,

28:14.652 --> 28:18.531
because I spend more time on it
than I do on her.

28:18.572 --> 28:21.200
She says I should be
more attentive in bed.

28:21.242 --> 28:23.869
Now, I'm in bed.
I'm not fast asleep.

28:23.911 --> 28:26.038
I'd say that's
pretty damn attentive.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.624
Of course, it doesn't help much
that I'm going bald on top.

28:28.666 --> 28:31.043
But I got hair growing out
of the tops of my toes.

28:31.085 --> 28:33.796
-You want a drink?
-I'm good.

28:33.838 --> 28:35.965
This guy's nothing.
You can beat him.

28:36.006 --> 28:37.633
It's not a competition.

28:37.675 --> 28:39.802
Well, yeah, it kind of is.

28:39.844 --> 28:41.387
You gonna do the shopping bit?

28:41.429 --> 28:42.805
It's not ready yet.

28:42.847 --> 28:44.557
I thought it went good
the other night.

28:44.598 --> 28:45.891
It's not ready.

28:45.933 --> 28:47.309
Okay.

28:47.351 --> 28:49.061
MILES:
Here's the thing, a penis is...

28:49.103 --> 28:50.479
-You have a thread...
-I got it.

28:50.521 --> 28:52.481
-You're up next.
-Finally.

28:52.523 --> 28:55.067
Now, you're not gonna go after
any of my guys tonight, right?

28:55.109 --> 28:57.153
-You're gonna be a good girl?
-"Good girl"?

28:57.194 --> 28:58.404
What are you,
her kindergarten teacher?

28:58.446 --> 28:59.822
Hey, I wasn't talking to you.

28:59.864 --> 29:01.574
I'm her manager
and I get ten percent

29:01.615 --> 29:03.909
precisely to tell you she can do
whatever the fuck she wants.

29:03.951 --> 29:06.162
I'm not gonna go after any
of your guys. I promise.

29:06.203 --> 29:07.663
Okay. Let's go.

29:07.705 --> 29:09.582
Thank you. I'm Miles Shapiro.

29:09.623 --> 29:12.418
I'll be at the Trap in Hoboken
for a full week in December,

29:12.460 --> 29:15.254
so hop on the H&M, come on out,
and keep me company!

29:15.296 --> 29:16.255
Good night, everybody!

29:16.297 --> 29:19.258
(cheering and applause)

29:19.300 --> 29:21.510
Next up onto the stage,

29:21.552 --> 29:23.429
a pretty lady with a lot to say.

29:23.471 --> 29:26.182
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mrs. Maisel.

29:26.223 --> 29:27.933
-(applause)
-Hey, wait.
We didn't do "Tits up."

29:27.975 --> 29:30.519
-Tits up.
-Tits...

29:30.561 --> 29:32.354
MIDGE:
Good evening, everyone.

29:32.396 --> 29:34.940
I'm Mrs. Maisel.
It's great to be here at--

29:34.982 --> 29:37.610
-Wait, where are we? Oh, right.
-(laughter)

29:37.651 --> 29:41.363
In that case,
it's just okay to be here.

29:41.405 --> 29:42.948
It's better than traffic.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.783
Or prison.
Well, maybe not traffic.

29:44.825 --> 29:48.037
Prison has less angry people
screaming.

29:48.078 --> 29:49.455
I almost didn't make it here
at all.

29:49.497 --> 29:51.707
My best friend Imogene
just had a baby.

29:51.749 --> 29:53.626
A little girl.

29:53.667 --> 29:55.377
She's adorable.

29:55.419 --> 29:58.214
Still has the cute little
forceps dent in her head.

29:58.255 --> 30:01.050
And I sat there
in that hospital room thinking

30:01.091 --> 30:03.719
about all the things this little
girl has to look forward to:

30:03.761 --> 30:05.554
roller skates,

30:05.596 --> 30:06.972
jump rope,

30:07.014 --> 30:08.974
cramps,

30:09.016 --> 30:12.144
and one day getting pregnant
and having her own baby.

30:12.186 --> 30:14.313
And I started really thinking
about the whole pregnancy thing.

30:14.355 --> 30:16.398
I mean, okay, you have sex.

30:16.440 --> 30:17.816
Nice.

30:17.858 --> 30:20.152
You get pregnant. Nice.

30:20.194 --> 30:22.738
You let a human being grow
inside your stomach

30:22.780 --> 30:26.408
for nine months
till it's six to 12 pounds large

30:26.450 --> 30:28.035
and then you give it
an escape route

30:28.077 --> 30:29.370
the size of a change purse.

30:29.411 --> 30:30.829
And-and not a normal

30:30.871 --> 30:32.498
"I'm going to the market"
sized change purse,

30:32.540 --> 30:35.501
with room for cash and
a Diners Club card, but a tiny

30:35.543 --> 30:37.169
little "I'm going out
for the evening,

30:37.211 --> 30:39.338
I just need lipstick"
change purse.

30:39.380 --> 30:42.132
Who agreed to this?

30:42.174 --> 30:43.801
Who, in the beginning,

30:43.842 --> 30:46.637
when it was getting sorted out,
negotiated this deal?

30:46.679 --> 30:48.138
Was it Eve?

30:48.180 --> 30:50.724
No. I bet it was Adam.

30:50.766 --> 30:53.060
He hadn't eaten
from the Tree of Knowledge yet,

30:53.102 --> 30:55.271
so he was just like,
"Yeah, that'll fit."

30:55.312 --> 30:57.606
See, the thing I know the most
about pregnancy

30:57.648 --> 30:59.608
-is that there is absolutely...
-BOBBY: Okay, okay, okay!

30:59.650 --> 31:02.945
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mrs. Maisel!

31:02.987 --> 31:04.822
(applause)

31:04.863 --> 31:06.073
All right,
we're gonna take a short break.

31:06.115 --> 31:09.493
But, uh, a lot more comedy ahead
of you, so get ready!

31:09.535 --> 31:11.745
Are you crazy?
You can't say that onstage.

31:11.787 --> 31:13.581
Say what, "change purse"?

31:13.622 --> 31:15.416
-What the fuck, Bobby?
-"Pregnant."

31:15.457 --> 31:17.334
I can't say "pregnant"?
Are you kidding?

31:17.376 --> 31:19.420
-Nobody wants to hear that word.
-Well, I know they don't want

31:19.461 --> 31:21.422
to hear it in the context
of "Guess what, I'm pregnant.

31:21.463 --> 31:23.257
-Who gets to tell your wife?"
-Any context.

31:23.299 --> 31:25.009
-It's foul.
-It's foul?

31:25.050 --> 31:27.177
The guy before her talked
about getting dick fungus.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.263
That was funny.
This is female stuff.

31:29.305 --> 31:31.265
-It's private.
-It's real.

31:31.307 --> 31:33.100
It's life. Literally.

31:33.142 --> 31:35.185
She can talk
about whatever she wants to.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.354
-It's her act.
-Nope. Here she tells jokes.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.106
You want to talk
about your female parts,

31:39.148 --> 31:42.526
you go see the obstrenician--
ob-- whatever the fuck.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.862
Not on my stage!

31:44.903 --> 31:46.947
I hate that guy.

31:46.989 --> 31:49.283
Screw this place. We don't have
to play here anymore.

31:49.325 --> 31:50.784
Really?
Where else are we gonna go?

31:50.826 --> 31:52.620
-Anywhere.
-Anywhere below Midtown

31:52.661 --> 31:54.455
or in another state,
as long as it's a shithole

31:54.496 --> 31:56.040
and has only three people
in it, right?

31:56.081 --> 31:57.958
Next thing you know, I'll
be reduced to doing two minutes

31:58.000 --> 32:00.461
in the ladies' room. I mean,
"Why are there mints in here?

32:00.502 --> 32:02.296
"It's not your mouth
that needs refreshing.

32:02.338 --> 32:04.298
"Am I right, ladies?
I'll be here all week.

32:04.340 --> 32:05.716
Remember to tip your attendant."

32:05.758 --> 32:07.468
We'll find more clubs.

32:07.509 --> 32:08.886
This business sucks.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.054
I hate it.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.305
Hey, that's the game.

32:11.347 --> 32:12.389
You know that.

33:13.826 --> 33:15.786
and this asshole literally
pushed me off the stage

my best friend having a baby.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.084
...a little emasculated
right now.

36:14.089 --> 36:17.467
I don't really mind it,
actually.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.303
♪ So long ♪

36:19.344 --> 36:22.723
Sunday night. 8:00.

36:22.764 --> 36:24.725
♪ The long ♪

36:24.766 --> 36:26.768
Bring an umbrella.

36:26.810 --> 36:29.187
♪ Very long. ♪

36:36.737 --> 36:38.989
"Eat shit." You eat shit.

36:39.031 --> 36:41.283
I'm kidnapped,
my client's fucked over,

36:41.325 --> 36:44.620
but I'm the one
that has to eat shit?

36:44.661 --> 36:47.706
(sighs)

36:47.748 --> 36:48.999
Okay, screw it.

36:49.041 --> 36:52.169
(doorbell plays a tune)

36:54.212 --> 36:56.214
-Miss Myerson?
-Yeah.

36:56.256 --> 36:58.717
May I see some form
of identification?

37:00.093 --> 37:01.303
Won't you come in?

37:01.345 --> 37:03.305
Thanks.

37:03.347 --> 37:05.265
Wow, cramped.

37:08.810 --> 37:11.855
Miss Susie Myerson.

37:11.897 --> 37:14.149
Jesus Christ.

37:14.191 --> 37:17.110
Come closer.

37:17.152 --> 37:19.154
(dogs panting)

37:20.697 --> 37:22.699
Close enough.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.701
Two steps back.

37:29.039 --> 37:30.415
So...

37:30.457 --> 37:33.835
Okay, look, I came here to eat
shit so just let me eat it.

37:33.877 --> 37:38.256
I thought my secretary told you
to eat before you came.

37:38.298 --> 37:39.841
The other night
in my dressing room you said

37:39.883 --> 37:42.636
some dreadful things.

37:42.678 --> 37:45.055
There were threats of violence.

37:45.097 --> 37:48.433
Against me, against my costume.

37:48.475 --> 37:50.102
I know, I'm sorry about that.

37:50.143 --> 37:53.563
You blocked my steam; no one has
ever blocked my steam before.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.774
I was out of line, okay?

37:55.816 --> 37:57.901
But you have to understand,
I was protecting my client.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.319
-Out!
-Okay.

37:59.361 --> 38:02.322
SOPHIE:
Not you.

38:02.364 --> 38:07.327
Did you know that I went
to the Yale School of Drama?

38:07.369 --> 38:10.956
That's where I met Kazan.
Fucked him, too.

38:10.998 --> 38:16.920
I fancied myself Medea, Phaedra,

38:16.962 --> 38:21.633
Nora, Hedda Gabler,
Maggie the Cat...

38:21.675 --> 38:23.260
Richard III?

38:23.301 --> 38:26.013
But fate had something different
in store for me.

38:26.054 --> 38:29.266
Sophie from Queens.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.935
(chuckles) You know
I've never been to Queens?

38:31.977 --> 38:34.396
I've driven through,
I've performed there,

38:34.438 --> 38:36.273
but I've never actually been.

38:36.314 --> 38:39.609
Tell me, is that really
how they talk?

38:39.651 --> 38:41.653
Well, they don't discuss
putting things on plates

38:41.695 --> 38:42.863
as much as you think.

38:42.904 --> 38:46.324
Harry Drake, he knew
I wanted to be a serious actress

38:46.366 --> 38:49.036
when he signed me,
but he didn't care.

38:49.077 --> 38:51.830
(chuckles) He didn't care about
Sophie from Ann Arbor.

38:51.872 --> 38:55.083
He only cared about
Sophie from Queens.

38:55.125 --> 38:58.587
And I thought, "All right,
so become a star, Sophie.

38:58.628 --> 39:00.213
Then you can do
whatever you want."

39:00.255 --> 39:03.300
And now I am a star.

39:03.341 --> 39:07.679
And I still slap on
a fat suit night after night

39:07.721 --> 39:10.474
because my people
don't think the audience

39:10.515 --> 39:13.310
will come see me in
A Streetcar Named Desire.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.770
Oh, they're wrong;
I'd pay anything

39:14.811 --> 39:16.563
to see you carted off
to an asylum.

39:16.605 --> 39:21.026
My people say, "Stay where you
are or you'll lose everything."

39:21.068 --> 39:23.195
They don't believe in me.

39:23.236 --> 39:25.405
I want someone to believe in me.

39:25.447 --> 39:28.658
To fight for me,
to threaten violence for me

39:28.700 --> 39:30.827
the way you threatened
violence for her.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.330
Well, Harry Drake did send
two guys to kill me.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.915
And yet here you are.

39:34.956 --> 39:38.877
Look, Sophie, Miriam and I
are just different, okay?

39:38.919 --> 39:41.671
We have kind of a special thing
going on, a connection.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.716
And I want
a special thing as well.

39:44.758 --> 39:48.220
I want someone
to have passion for me.

39:48.261 --> 39:53.934
Drive, vision, fearlessness.

39:53.975 --> 39:55.352
I want you.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.020
To what?

39:59.064 --> 40:02.609
I want you to be my manager.

40:02.651 --> 40:04.611
(dog howls)

40:07.072 --> 40:09.241
Do not concern yourself
with returning the coat.

40:09.282 --> 40:12.577
Miss Lennon's worn it twice.
Good-bye.

40:16.331 --> 40:18.667
What the fuck?!

40:20.919 --> 40:22.170
Second wedding, my ass.

40:23.588 --> 40:26.258
(phone rings)

40:26.299 --> 40:27.384
Hello?

40:27.425 --> 40:28.844
I've heard absolutely nothing
from your father

40:28.885 --> 40:30.137
and I'm going insane.

40:30.178 --> 40:31.263
Then you'll fit
right into our family.

40:31.304 --> 40:32.597
What could possibly be
the holdup?

40:32.639 --> 40:34.307
I'm a doctor. Do you know
what kind of parking spaces

40:34.349 --> 40:36.059
you get when you're a doctor?
Spectacular.

40:36.101 --> 40:37.227
That was the clincher for me.

40:37.269 --> 40:38.812
I wonder if I blew it
with my reading list.

40:38.854 --> 40:41.064
-Why?
-I padded it a little.

40:41.106 --> 40:42.649
A lot. I padded it a lot.

40:42.691 --> 40:44.401
-It doesn't matter.
-What if there's a quiz?

40:44.442 --> 40:46.403
-There won't be a quiz.
-We had fun, didn't we?

40:46.444 --> 40:48.655
Hey, relax.
You have surgery today.

40:48.697 --> 40:51.032
Go have a martini. Or you're in
a hospital, take a Seconal.

40:51.074 --> 40:52.367
Someday I'll need
to explain to you

40:52.409 --> 40:53.910
what surgery actually entails.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.662
-MAN: Paging Dr. Ettenberg.
-Maybe I should call him again.

40:55.704 --> 40:58.206
-Is that too desperate?
-Do you have to go?

40:58.248 --> 40:59.541
No. Why?

40:59.583 --> 41:01.585
-Aren't you Dr. Ettenberg?
-Yeah, so?

41:01.626 --> 41:03.170
Oh, God, I have to go.
I told you, insane.

41:03.211 --> 41:05.213
-I'll call you later.
-It's all going to be fine.

41:05.255 --> 41:06.673
I promise you.

41:06.715 --> 41:08.717
(phone rings)

41:08.758 --> 41:10.051
Hello?

41:10.093 --> 41:11.761
SHY (over phone):
May I speak to Mrs. Maisel?

41:11.803 --> 41:13.180
Who's calling?

41:13.221 --> 41:14.764
Shy Baldwin here.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.308
We met the other night,
remember?

41:16.349 --> 41:18.894
Remember? Well-- Shy Baldwin?

41:18.935 --> 41:21.188
Shy-- Mama!

41:21.229 --> 41:23.190
My mother would love to
talk to-- Mama, seriously!

41:23.231 --> 41:25.901
Oh, shit, I forgot. Hairdresser.

41:25.942 --> 41:27.319
Hairdresser's very important.

41:27.360 --> 41:28.945
She will never forgive me
if she misses this.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.155
She will kill me. Brutally.

41:30.197 --> 41:31.323
And then it might be linked
to you in the press

41:31.364 --> 41:32.490
and I'd feel terrible
about that. Please wait

41:32.532 --> 41:33.867
till she gets back.
Can I get you some coffee?

41:33.909 --> 41:35.785
Absolutely, cream and sugar.

41:35.827 --> 41:37.871
-You're not here.
-And you should be a singer

41:37.913 --> 41:39.122
with that kind
of breath control.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.332
I'm sorry.

41:40.373 --> 41:42.834
I'm just a really big--
Why are you calling?

41:42.876 --> 41:45.295
Because I saw you
on that telethon

41:45.337 --> 41:47.672
and I thought
you were sensational.

41:47.714 --> 41:49.674
And as I was sitting there
having my nightcap,

41:49.716 --> 41:53.303
I said to myself,
"Why isn't that girl a star?"

41:53.345 --> 41:55.347
And then I said to myself,
"Well, you know what, Shy,

41:55.388 --> 41:57.098
you can help
with this situation."

41:57.140 --> 41:59.267
So I am.

41:59.309 --> 42:02.229
How would you like
to open for me on tour?

42:02.270 --> 42:03.605
What?

42:03.647 --> 42:04.898
It'll be six months.

42:04.940 --> 42:06.399
Three in the States,
three in Europe.

42:06.441 --> 42:09.486
You'll do 30 minutes
and a couple of bits with me.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.196
We leave in two weeks
and you'll need

42:11.238 --> 42:13.740
a lot of new fancy clothes,
which I will pay for.

42:13.782 --> 42:16.493
There it is. That's the purpose
of my phone call.

42:16.534 --> 42:17.953
-So, what do you...
-Yes.

42:17.994 --> 42:19.704
Are you sure you don't need...

42:19.746 --> 42:21.206
No. Yes.

42:21.248 --> 42:22.958
Oh, my God. Yes.

42:22.999 --> 42:25.418
Then we have a deal,
little miss mouthy.

42:25.460 --> 42:28.213
I'll get in touch with your
people to work out the details.

42:28.255 --> 42:30.048
We're gonna have
a hell of a time.

42:30.090 --> 42:31.299
Talk to you soon.

42:37.681 --> 42:39.015
(screams)

42:41.643 --> 42:43.645
(panting)

42:46.273 --> 42:48.024
Oh!

42:48.066 --> 42:49.484
I have news.

42:49.526 --> 42:51.528
God, give me
a fucking heart attack.

42:51.569 --> 42:54.239
Wait, the heart attack's coming.
We need a drink.

42:54.281 --> 42:55.490
I need a defibrillator.

42:55.532 --> 42:57.325
-You ready?
-Sure.

42:57.367 --> 42:59.202
You are gonna have to give me
a better "sure" than that.

42:59.244 --> 43:01.913
-Sure!
-Ew, go back.

43:01.955 --> 43:03.206
Just fucking say it.

43:07.085 --> 43:09.879
We are going on tour
with Shy Baldwin.

43:09.921 --> 43:11.256
What?

43:11.298 --> 43:13.133
He saw me at the telethon
in my shit spot

43:13.174 --> 43:16.594
and he loved me and he wants me
to open for him for six months.

43:16.636 --> 43:19.097
Huh? How's that story
gonna play on Jack Paar?

43:19.139 --> 43:21.182
-You're sure it was Shy Baldwin?
-Yup.

43:21.224 --> 43:22.851
And you're sure
he asked you to tour,

43:22.892 --> 43:23.852
like flat-out asked you?

43:23.893 --> 43:24.853
I want a pink dressing room.

43:24.894 --> 43:25.979
Can you put that in my contract?

43:26.021 --> 43:27.439
You're gonna open
for Shy Baldwin.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.524
Fuck Midtown,
we're going to Europe.

43:29.566 --> 43:30.859
I'm gonna need a passport.

43:30.900 --> 43:32.193
And some decent underwear.

43:32.235 --> 43:33.737
I can't believe it.

43:33.778 --> 43:34.946
You know what I'd love to do?

43:34.988 --> 43:37.615
Buy Sophie Lennon some flowers.

43:37.657 --> 43:39.367
Sophie Lennon?

43:39.409 --> 43:41.578
If she hadn't bumped me, I never
would've gone on at midnight

43:41.619 --> 43:43.913
and Shy never would have seen me
and I wouldn't be assembling

43:43.955 --> 43:45.332
a fabulous traveling outfit
in my head right now.

43:45.373 --> 43:47.250
I see a blue hat with feathers.

43:47.292 --> 43:48.752
Let's just focus on the tour.

43:48.793 --> 43:51.421
Revenge is a dish
best served cold.

43:51.463 --> 43:53.590
Get ready for
some ice cream, bitch.

43:53.631 --> 43:54.883
I should get his people
on the phone.

43:54.924 --> 43:56.843
Start talking salary;
I don't want him thinking

43:56.885 --> 43:58.219
just 'cause you're new,
you're cheap.

43:58.261 --> 44:01.056
I am totally new
and completely cheap.

44:01.097 --> 44:03.016
Hey, hey.

44:06.519 --> 44:08.730
We did it. You and me.

44:10.732 --> 44:12.859
Miriam, I should tell you
something.

44:12.901 --> 44:14.027
-You love me.
-No.

44:14.069 --> 44:15.153
I am amazing.

44:15.195 --> 44:16.905
Can you please stop talking
about yourself?

44:16.946 --> 44:18.656
That's our bread and butter
now, sister.

44:18.698 --> 44:20.617
I just need to tell you...

44:20.658 --> 44:23.203
My underwear's fine, so shut up.

44:23.244 --> 44:24.954
We're going shopping.

44:24.996 --> 44:26.414
Right now.

44:26.456 --> 44:29.626
I have dresses to buy
and hats to buy

44:29.667 --> 44:32.045
and shoes to buy
and purses to buy.

44:32.087 --> 44:34.047
Should we maybe make some money
before we go broke

44:34.089 --> 44:37.759
and have to blow job
our way across Europe?

44:37.801 --> 44:39.260
(exhales)

44:40.345 --> 44:42.931
Hello? It's me. Who's here?

44:42.972 --> 44:44.599
ABE:
Miriam. I need to talk to you.

44:44.641 --> 44:46.017
-(door slams)
-Can you do it on the move?

44:46.059 --> 44:47.519
-I'm late.
-Of course you're late.

44:47.560 --> 44:48.603
You're always late.

44:48.645 --> 44:49.729
You ever wondered to yourself,

44:49.771 --> 44:51.564
-"Why am I always late?"
-No.

44:51.606 --> 44:53.608
Perhaps if you had a watch
for every outfit.

44:53.650 --> 44:56.861
-You needed to talk to me, Papa?
-Yes, I've made a decision.

44:56.903 --> 44:58.071
About what?

44:58.113 --> 45:00.198
What do you mean, "about what?"

45:00.240 --> 45:03.368
How many decisions concerning
you am I making these days?

45:03.410 --> 45:04.536
I don't know. Six?

45:04.577 --> 45:05.912
-No.
-Eight?

45:05.954 --> 45:07.205
-No.
-35?

45:07.247 --> 45:09.833
I made a decision
concerning you and Benjamin.

45:09.874 --> 45:13.461
I know it took longer
than you had desired,

45:13.503 --> 45:15.338
but I had a devil of a time
getting my hands

45:15.380 --> 45:16.840
on his vaccination records.

45:16.881 --> 45:19.467
I'm happy to say
his references checked out,

45:19.509 --> 45:21.970
his financials are sufficient,
he can swim,

45:22.011 --> 45:24.013
he's up-to-date
on his mortgage payments,

45:24.055 --> 45:26.433
his tax returns are in order,

45:26.474 --> 45:29.602
and his patients have
an 86% survival rate.

45:29.644 --> 45:32.105
I will admit his reading list
gave me pause.

45:32.147 --> 45:36.651
Panaslotsky is not a real author
and I was briefly offended

45:36.693 --> 45:38.403
that he thought
I could be duped.

45:38.445 --> 45:41.990
However, after much
deliberation, Miriam,

45:42.031 --> 45:44.701
I have decided to give
Benjamin permission

45:44.742 --> 45:46.619
to ask for your hand.

45:46.661 --> 45:49.122
You may get married. Again.

45:50.290 --> 45:54.669
What? What?

45:56.254 --> 45:57.464
-Shit.
-(door opens)

45:57.505 --> 46:00.258
ROSE:
Hello? Anyone here?

46:00.300 --> 46:02.719
-Not a word. I'm coming, Rose.
-But Papa...

46:02.760 --> 46:04.888
I have been waiting here all day
to tell your mother

46:04.929 --> 46:06.764
some things that may well
make her take to her bed,

46:06.806 --> 46:08.933
and I won't get a chance to
tell her those things if she's

46:08.975 --> 46:10.435
-already taken to her bed.
-But...

46:10.477 --> 46:12.479
Me first!

46:14.147 --> 46:17.233
David Begelman says hello; I
ran into him at the shoe repair.

46:17.275 --> 46:19.819
-He's aging very poorly.
-That's great.

46:19.861 --> 46:23.615
Why don't we go into
my study for a minute?

46:23.656 --> 46:25.033
-Okay.
-(sighs)

46:25.074 --> 46:27.035
Just take a seat, please.

46:27.076 --> 46:29.787
Um, where?

46:29.829 --> 46:33.833
-Oh, uh...
-MIDGE: Mama?

46:33.875 --> 46:35.543
-Uh...
-Papa?

46:35.585 --> 46:38.838
-I'm late, I'm heading out!
-(door opens)

46:38.880 --> 46:41.049
Abe, please, what do you want
to talk about?

46:41.090 --> 46:43.301
-Rose...
-(door closes)

46:43.343 --> 46:44.636
You know that things have been

46:44.677 --> 46:46.888
a little unsettled
for me lately.

46:46.930 --> 46:49.224
I know. They'll get better.

46:49.265 --> 46:52.352
Yes, well, I went to Bell Labs
and talked to Charles.

46:52.393 --> 46:54.562
-I was incredibly reasonable.
-Oh, dear.

46:54.604 --> 46:56.397
-Is he hurt?
-No, Charles is fine.

46:56.439 --> 46:58.191
We just talked.

46:58.233 --> 47:01.653
But something happened to me
during that talk.

47:01.694 --> 47:04.989
I started to think
about my life.

47:05.031 --> 47:08.201
Who I used to be,
who I've become.

47:08.243 --> 47:13.414
The choices I've made,
the way I've raised my children.

47:13.456 --> 47:15.625
I think I need
to reevaluate some things.

47:15.667 --> 47:17.210
What things?

47:17.252 --> 47:21.965
It's not going to work out
with Bell Labs, Rose.

47:22.006 --> 47:24.133
That is not a place
for me anymore.

47:24.175 --> 47:27.136
Well, fine, you'll just focus
on the university.

47:27.178 --> 47:29.013
And I'm going to leave Columbia.

47:29.055 --> 47:30.348
What?

47:30.390 --> 47:32.475
I don't want to teach
there anymore.

47:32.517 --> 47:33.851
But-but you're
a tenured professor.

47:33.893 --> 47:36.813
I know. And they want
to put me on the shelf.

47:36.854 --> 47:38.856
-Take a sabbatical.
-A paid sabbatical.

47:38.898 --> 47:41.401
I don't want their money
if I'm not earning it.

47:41.442 --> 47:43.361
-Of course you do.
-I'm going to give it up.

47:43.403 --> 47:44.696
All of it.

47:44.737 --> 47:47.031
-The job, the tenure...
-You've lost your mind.

47:47.073 --> 47:48.658
No, I haven't.

47:48.700 --> 47:50.243
You're leaving Columbia?

47:50.285 --> 47:53.162
I don't want to spend my life
just drifting along.

47:53.204 --> 47:56.374
I used to have purpose.
I want it back.

47:56.416 --> 47:58.167
-You're giving up your tenure?
-Yes.

47:58.209 --> 48:00.253
Colombia owns
our apartment, Abe.

48:05.008 --> 48:09.220
Yes... they do.

48:09.262 --> 48:11.264
So, what do we do?

48:11.306 --> 48:13.474
Move in with Miriam
and Benjamin?

48:20.273 --> 48:24.027
You'd really better sit down.

48:24.068 --> 48:26.988
(applause)

48:27.030 --> 48:28.823
STEVE ALLEN:
So I'll tell you how we're

48:28.865 --> 48:30.825
gonna fix the problem.
We've decided

48:30.867 --> 48:32.744
that once a month,
we will book a comedian

48:32.785 --> 48:33.953
-who will offend everyone.
-(laughter)

48:33.995 --> 48:35.788
Fair enough? All right.

48:35.830 --> 48:37.498
-MIDGE: He knows I'm coming.
-MAN: Doesn't matter.

48:37.540 --> 48:39.167
-He knows I'm coming.
-You're not on the list.

48:39.208 --> 48:40.627
-He knows I'm coming.
-He didn't leave a name.

48:40.668 --> 48:42.170
He knows I'm coming. Lenny.

48:42.211 --> 48:44.088
It's all right, Perry.
She's my mother.

48:44.130 --> 48:46.007
You didn't leave my name.
Perry's having a heart attack.

48:46.049 --> 48:47.634
I'm very sorry, Perry.
It won't happen again.

48:47.675 --> 48:49.218
People's names
are supposed to be on the list.

48:49.260 --> 48:50.887
That's how it works.

48:50.928 --> 48:52.930
There goes the next president
of the United States.

48:52.972 --> 48:54.307
Never mind him.
Let me look at you.

48:54.349 --> 48:57.852
Good suit. Nice tie.
Hair's fine.

48:57.894 --> 49:00.855
Get ready for your intro.
Only he goes onstage.

49:00.897 --> 49:03.107
Hmm, Perry knows me better
than I thought.

49:03.149 --> 49:04.942
STEVE:
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

49:04.984 --> 49:06.778
here is
a very shocking comedian,

49:06.819 --> 49:08.821
the most shocking comedian
of our time.

49:08.863 --> 49:11.366
A young man
who is skyrocketing to fame,

49:11.407 --> 49:12.700
-Lenny Bruce.
-(cheering and applause)

49:12.742 --> 49:15.787
-Tits up.
-Thanks.

49:15.828 --> 49:18.289
-You'll explain that
when I get back?
-Yes, I will.

49:28.174 --> 49:30.968
LENNY: Will Elizabeth Taylor
become bar mitzvahed?

49:31.010 --> 49:32.428
(laughter)

49:32.470 --> 49:34.138
Yeah, I promise continuity.

49:34.180 --> 49:35.807
I'll do all the lines
that we rehearsed.

49:35.848 --> 49:37.892
And actually, I do have

49:37.934 --> 49:41.562
and always will be accused
of banter.

49:41.604 --> 49:43.356
Ha! Yeah.

49:43.398 --> 49:46.234
But there is another side
to my nature--

49:46.275 --> 49:48.277
uh, the aesthetic side.

49:48.319 --> 49:51.364
-(piano playing)
-A Clyde Beatty. Ha!

49:51.406 --> 49:53.783
-And I'm going to, uh...
-(chuckles)

49:53.825 --> 49:55.451
Oh, did you dig that?

49:55.493 --> 49:57.495
-Yeah.
-Oh, I'm so happy.

49:57.537 --> 50:00.957
And I'm going to write
a musical, uh, with Steve Allen.

50:00.998 --> 50:03.418
And it's sort of
a nice kind of thing.

50:03.459 --> 50:05.545
And it's about a couple,

50:05.586 --> 50:08.548
and if you've been married,
you know, or are now,

50:08.589 --> 50:10.258
you know the scene that happens.

50:10.299 --> 50:12.468
You have a million beefs
with your old lady,

50:12.510 --> 50:15.179
and you break up,
then you go back together again.

50:15.221 --> 50:18.182
But this couple in the play,
they're a little eccentric,

50:18.224 --> 50:20.810
and they've broken up
and gone back

50:20.852 --> 50:24.147
about 55 times in seven years.

50:24.188 --> 50:26.816
But they keep going back
for the kids' sake.

50:26.858 --> 50:29.694
So, finally, they go
to a marriage counselor,

50:29.736 --> 50:32.196
it opens up,
and they're together,

50:32.238 --> 50:35.241
and they're happy
without one argument.

50:35.283 --> 50:37.118
But the kids are complete nuts

50:37.160 --> 50:40.872
'cause they were so adjusted
to that scene--

50:40.913 --> 50:43.499
you know, breaking up
and going back together--

50:43.541 --> 50:45.251
that it's been
too much for them.

50:45.293 --> 50:48.254
So they decide,
for the kids' sake,

50:48.296 --> 50:50.006
to break up.

50:50.047 --> 50:51.924
And in the scene,

50:51.966 --> 50:53.634
Steve, like, you know,
he's my friend,

50:53.676 --> 50:55.386
and we're hanging out together,

50:55.428 --> 50:57.388
and, uh, he's got
the first line.

50:57.430 --> 51:00.183
All right. Hey, Lenny,
where's your old lady?

51:00.224 --> 51:03.352
-Oh, we had a beef, man.
We broke up.
-Oh, that's too bad.

51:03.394 --> 51:04.896
But don't worry,
you'll get back together.

51:04.937 --> 51:06.606
No, that's it, you know?

51:06.647 --> 51:08.691
You have a million fights,
and finally you decide

51:08.733 --> 51:10.318
that's the one.
You've had it, you know?

51:10.359 --> 51:12.195
And I finally got the guts,
and I got rid of her.

51:12.236 --> 51:14.155
I don't believe it, man,
but I finally did it.

51:14.197 --> 51:16.449
-I finally got rid of her.
-How'd you do that?

51:16.491 --> 51:17.742
She left me.

51:19.327 --> 51:20.912
But it's better off, man.

51:20.953 --> 51:22.246
You're better off alone.

51:22.288 --> 51:24.123
I'm really gonna swing.

51:24.165 --> 51:26.709
I'm gonna fix up my own pad.

51:26.751 --> 51:28.836
That's it.
I can really fix up a pad.

51:28.878 --> 51:32.340
I'm gonna really get some
of that shiny black furniture.

51:32.381 --> 51:34.300
And I'll get
a bullfight poster.

51:34.342 --> 51:37.345
And I'll get a coffee table,
and I'll make a door out of it.

51:37.386 --> 51:41.057
And I'll just really swing,
and it'll just be nice.

51:41.098 --> 51:43.476
And I'll get
a satin smoking jacket

51:43.518 --> 51:45.770
and a pearl white phone,
and I'll sit back and relax,

51:45.812 --> 51:47.647
and finally
I'll be all alone, man.

51:47.688 --> 51:50.316
That's the best way to make it.
All alone.

51:50.358 --> 51:53.194

52:12.547 --> 52:14.340
Sorry to keep you waiting, Abe.

52:14.382 --> 52:17.009
No problem. I just got here.

52:17.051 --> 52:19.679
-My father says hello.
-How is Robert?

52:19.720 --> 52:21.931
Angry. Hostile. The same.

52:21.973 --> 52:23.683
Give him my best.

52:23.724 --> 52:26.435
We-we should all have a meal
one of these days.

52:26.477 --> 52:29.772
We could regale you with tales
of two angry young men

52:29.814 --> 52:31.232
who thought
they knew everything.

52:31.274 --> 52:33.442
-My father still does.
-(laughs)

52:33.484 --> 52:35.736
He was a great speaker.

52:35.778 --> 52:38.030
And he made great signs.

52:38.072 --> 52:40.616
So, what can I do for you, Abe?

52:40.658 --> 52:44.704
Well, there are things happening
in my life

52:44.745 --> 52:48.082
that I believe I'm going to need
a really good lawyer for.

52:48.124 --> 52:51.127
You know the kind of law
I practice, right?

52:52.670 --> 52:56.549
I'm spoiling
for a really good fight.

52:56.591 --> 52:59.218
Well, then you've come
to the right man.

52:59.260 --> 53:00.928

Sometimes I wish

53:45.598 --> 53:48.517
But it'd probably take her
two hours to get ready.

53:49.977 --> 53:51.354
When she's old,

53:51.395 --> 53:53.022
then she's gonna be sorry.

53:53.064 --> 53:55.858
That's it. Like,
she's young and swinging now,

53:55.900 --> 53:57.693
and she can get a lot of guys,
but when she's old--

53:57.735 --> 53:59.528
I can see, about 20 years
from now.

53:59.570 --> 54:00.905
"Oh, how you doing, Annie?

54:00.947 --> 54:02.657
"Yeah, haven't seen you
in a long time.

54:02.698 --> 54:04.367
"You look pretty good, baby.
You still washing your hair

54:04.408 --> 54:06.369

54:06.410 --> 54:08.746
"Yeah. Yeah,
you look pretty good.

54:08.788 --> 54:10.831
"You gained a few pounds.
What happened to your neck?

54:10.873 --> 54:14.543
"Yeah. I heard you got married
a few times.

54:14.585 --> 54:17.421
"Uh, me? No, I, uh,
I've always stayed single.

54:17.463 --> 54:19.382
"I've-I've been investing
in property.

54:19.423 --> 54:21.300

54:21.342 --> 54:24.428
"Maybe you've heard of it.
It's called Acapulco.

54:24.470 --> 54:25.805
"Where are you living?

54:25.846 --> 54:28.683
"A furnished room?
Oh, that's nice.

54:28.724 --> 54:30.351
"Yeah, you cook on the radiator,
the paper drapes.

54:30.393 --> 54:33.312
"Sit in the lobby, watch
television and all that, yeah.

54:33.354 --> 54:34.897
"That's cool, yeah.

54:34.939 --> 54:36.649
"You have the Diners Club,
you sign for it.

You go first class in those
joints, I know that, yeah."

54:38.818 --> 54:40.653
That's it.

54:40.695 --> 54:43.739
Her future spells a murky gloom.

54:43.781 --> 54:45.324
I'll be rich and famous,

54:45.366 --> 54:47.076
and she'll be living
in a furnished room.

54:47.118 --> 54:49.203
But it's gonna be too late.

54:49.245 --> 54:51.414
I won't hear her moan.

54:51.455 --> 54:55.251
I'll be living in my Nob Hill

I'm gonna open

55:36.959 --> 55:38.586
Midge, that's...

55:38.627 --> 55:40.921
He wants me to go

He says I'll be gone six months.

55:43.174 --> 55:46.677
And I said yes.

55:46.719 --> 55:48.179
Just like that.

55:48.220 --> 55:49.722
Didn't even think about it.

55:49.764 --> 55:53.059
Didn't think about
anything or anyone.

55:53.100 --> 55:55.644
Just yes.

55:55.686 --> 55:58.439
And I understand now.

55:58.481 --> 56:01.984
Everything's different.

56:02.026 --> 56:04.653
I can't go back
to Jell-O molds.

56:04.695 --> 56:08.866
There won't be three
before 30 for me.

56:08.908 --> 56:11.660
I just made a choice.

56:11.702 --> 56:16.165
-Midge...
-I am gonna be all alone

56:16.207 --> 56:19.877
for the rest of my life.

56:19.919 --> 56:22.421
That's what I just decided
in a five-minute phone call.

56:22.463 --> 56:25.299
Amazing, isn't it?

56:25.341 --> 56:27.301
You don't know that.
You don't...

56:27.343 --> 56:28.928
I'm gonna leave really soon.

56:28.969 --> 56:30.513
Barely enough time
to get packed.

56:30.554 --> 56:32.181
Especially the way
that I travel.

56:34.809 --> 56:38.104
And I don't want to be alone.

56:38.145 --> 56:40.481
Not tonight.

56:40.523 --> 56:44.360
Tonight--
just for tonight--

56:44.401 --> 56:47.530
I really need to be with someone
who loves me.
