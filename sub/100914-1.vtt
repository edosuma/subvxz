02:17.745 --> 02:18.787
Kid!

02:24.037 --> 02:25.162
Move your arse!

02:42.412 --> 02:43.703
In you go. Go on.

02:50.912 --> 02:52.578
Can you give him another chance Mick?

02:53.662 --> 02:55.037
He's got a lot on his plate.

02:55.703 --> 02:56.828
His girl's pregnant.

03:10.787 --> 03:12.620
- See you Monday.
- Aye, see you.

03:21.453 --> 03:23.578
I asked you if this is what you wanted.
I warned you.

03:23.662 --> 03:25.037
- Yeah, you warned me.
- Yeah.

04:04.412 --> 04:07.412
But all the boys have one.
Most of the girls as well.

04:07.620 --> 04:09.287
- Don't twist the knife.
- I'm not!

04:10.870 --> 04:12.578
Do you hit harder if you're wearing white?

04:12.662 --> 04:14.537
I think you probably definitely do.

04:15.787 --> 04:16.870
I doubt it.

04:17.287 --> 04:19.453
You don't know what it feels like
to feel shame.

04:20.912 --> 04:22.287
Come on, pick up the pace.

04:22.453 --> 04:23.453
Real shame!

04:23.662 --> 04:24.662
Hey!

04:25.162 --> 04:26.370
Do you want fajitas tonight?

04:27.287 --> 04:28.828
Real Shame, do you want fajitas tonight?

04:28.995 --> 04:30.370
- You know I do.
- Right.

04:35.412 --> 04:37.828
Maybe your mum and me
will have some wine tonight.

04:39.912 --> 04:41.078
Fuck's sake.

04:42.078 --> 04:43.120
That was your fault.

04:44.078 --> 04:45.912
It's all right, Dad,
they won't make you pay for it.

04:45.995 --> 04:46.912
Shut up.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.745
I've seen it happen before.

05:25.703 --> 05:26.620
How's my boys?

05:26.703 --> 05:27.870
- Fine.
- Fine.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.287
And my man?

05:30.453 --> 05:31.537
Fine.

05:58.453 --> 05:59.620
What's up with you?

05:59.703 --> 06:01.703
I bet I could punch a hole
in this door.

06:11.078 --> 06:12.245
You just get too excited.

06:13.245 --> 06:15.495
I'm going upstairs for a minute.
Nobody come up to our room.

06:15.578 --> 06:16.662
Finnie, that means you.

06:20.370 --> 06:22.203
You'll be okay, just keep the peas on it.

06:24.370 --> 06:25.537
- Stevie, hold them!
- I am.

06:25.620 --> 06:27.203
- Hold them proper!
- I am!

06:31.203 --> 06:32.120
Stevie, man!

06:34.078 --> 06:35.495
Come on, get out of my way.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.078
Want some?

06:54.078 --> 06:55.453
Come on, I asked you to move.

06:58.745 --> 06:59.620
Wait!

07:09.953 --> 07:10.912
Nice.

07:11.870 --> 07:12.828
Do you think?

07:13.120 --> 07:13.995
Yeah.

07:15.370 --> 07:16.537
I got you something as well.

07:24.662 --> 07:26.078
Did he tell you he got canned?

07:26.620 --> 07:28.578
Told me he had the weekend
to think about it.

07:30.412 --> 07:31.870
What's there to think about?

07:32.245 --> 07:34.120
He doesn't want to work there.
You should see him.

07:36.287 --> 07:37.620
It's embarrassing, Katie.

07:37.703 --> 07:38.578
Open your present.

07:50.912 --> 07:52.078
It's a shirt.

07:52.745 --> 07:53.870
It's a nice shirt.

07:55.620 --> 07:57.703
I thought I wasn't getting to go
to your mum and dad's 40th.

07:57.828 --> 07:59.703
- It's not for that.
- What's it for?

08:00.620 --> 08:01.620
Try it on.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.287
I will after my shower.

08:06.412 --> 08:08.078
Come on, it'll make you feel better
about yourself.

08:09.828 --> 08:10.995
Who told you that, the sales girl?

08:11.078 --> 08:12.745
I bought it online,
there was no sales girl.

08:12.870 --> 08:14.995
Katie, I stink.

08:15.078 --> 08:15.995
I stink too.

08:16.078 --> 08:17.662
Yeah, but not like me.

08:30.912 --> 08:32.162
For fuck's sake, Dad.

09:15.912 --> 09:17.162
Very handsome.

09:18.578 --> 09:19.537
I'll do that.

09:19.620 --> 09:20.495
I don't mind.

09:20.620 --> 09:22.203
It's my night, you go change.

09:22.787 --> 09:23.745
Do you like it?

09:24.995 --> 09:26.203
Yeah, it fits fine.

09:33.828 --> 09:35.328
Katie, I can manage, you go change.

09:35.453 --> 09:36.662
God, your hands are red...

09:36.870 --> 09:38.328
Red as that pepper, look.

09:42.995 --> 09:45.370
Um, Stevie needs a karate suit.

09:45.620 --> 09:46.870
It's not been six weeks.

09:46.953 --> 09:48.162
How long's it been?

09:48.287 --> 09:49.162
Three.

09:49.245 --> 09:50.162
Well he needs one.

09:50.578 --> 09:53.245
It was you said six weeks.
Do you want me to do this onion?

09:53.328 --> 09:55.245
No, I want you to go get changed.

09:55.828 --> 09:56.703
Why?

09:57.495 --> 09:59.620
You're not going to wear that
to eat your fajitas in?

10:00.078 --> 10:01.120
I won't spill.

10:01.662 --> 10:03.037
- Katie...
- What?

10:03.120 --> 10:04.912
- The boys will be coming down in a minute.
- So?

10:05.037 --> 10:07.287
- So, you want them to see you like that?
- Like what?

10:08.953 --> 10:11.120
I just don't see the point in dressing up
to sit about the house.

10:11.537 --> 10:14.745
Well, I want to see what if feels like
before I take the label off. Is that okay?

10:33.203 --> 10:35.370
Dad, you're not very far along are you?

10:36.912 --> 10:38.703
What do you think
of your mum's dress, Stevie?

10:39.453 --> 10:40.870
It's not for me to say.

10:41.162 --> 10:42.370
She's going to change in a minute.

10:42.453 --> 10:44.287
No, she's not going to change in a minute.

10:48.745 --> 10:50.078
Fuck me, Mum, you look hot.

10:50.203 --> 10:51.495
What did you just say?

10:53.120 --> 10:54.287
Are you two going out?

10:56.162 --> 10:57.537
She can if she wants.

10:59.703 --> 11:00.912
Did you remember the sour cream?

11:00.995 --> 11:02.662
For fuck's sake, why'd you not remind me?

11:03.037 --> 11:05.328
- Too busy going on about your Karate suit.
- Don't blame me.

11:05.412 --> 11:07.203
Do you want to go see if they've got
any at the garage?

11:07.287 --> 11:08.953
- I'll go, I'll go.
- It's fine.

11:10.412 --> 11:11.620
I'm not asking you to go.

11:11.745 --> 11:12.995
Do you need money?

11:14.037 --> 11:15.037
Yeah, give him money.

11:15.162 --> 11:16.370
It's fine, I've got some.

11:24.578 --> 11:25.453
I'd have gone, Katie.

11:25.537 --> 11:26.870
You're cooking, he's got a car.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.787
Does that make him your go-to man now?

11:32.620 --> 11:34.287
- Where are you going?
- To change.

11:37.745 --> 11:39.245
Wear the dress. Katie!

11:39.662 --> 11:40.703
You can wear the dress.

11:40.828 --> 11:42.245
Fuck's sake.

11:45.162 --> 11:46.037
Fuck's sake.

12:01.953 --> 12:04.745
- What can I do, Dad?
- Nothing, I don't need help.

12:09.912 --> 12:11.412
- Stevie.
- What?

12:14.370 --> 12:15.953
Come and help me wrap these fajitas.

12:48.370 --> 12:51.078
Dad, we're coming up with things
for Kid to do with his life.

12:51.953 --> 12:52.870
Oh, yeah?

12:53.162 --> 12:56.370
My suggestions are road-sweeper
and transvestite.

12:57.078 --> 12:58.953
Transvestite's not a job, Stevie.

12:59.037 --> 13:01.328
It is, when they go and sing in the bars.

13:01.495 --> 13:03.953
Well... So, he could be
a nightclub singer?

13:05.037 --> 13:07.037
Yeah but also a transvestite.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.162
- This is serious.
- I am being serious.

13:09.245 --> 13:11.037
This is serious ideas I'm giving you.

13:13.578 --> 13:15.662
Are you seeing Kelly tonight?

13:15.745 --> 13:17.662
- No, she's working.
- She's always working.

13:18.162 --> 13:20.037
What will she make of you losing your job,
your girl?

13:20.287 --> 13:21.495
He hasn't lost his job.

13:22.453 --> 13:23.412
Jacked it in, then.

13:26.912 --> 13:28.912
Where do you see yourself
in ten years' time?

13:30.245 --> 13:31.495
I can't think that far ahead.

13:32.287 --> 13:34.578
- Well, one year then.
- One year, what?

13:34.662 --> 13:36.828
Well, do you see yourself
at the factory a year from now?

13:36.953 --> 13:38.745
I'd rather stab myself in the fucking eye.

13:38.828 --> 13:39.787
Here, I'll do that for you.

13:40.245 --> 13:42.745
Leave him, I'm trying to get him
to understand something.

13:42.870 --> 13:44.287
Dad's not playing.

13:44.453 --> 13:45.912
Of course I'm playing.

13:47.453 --> 13:48.745
He won't let go!

13:48.912 --> 13:51.537
You don't always get to choose, you know?

13:52.245 --> 13:54.037
- Does your girl like her job?
- Finnie, will you let me...

13:54.120 --> 13:56.245
She happy carrying you
as well as your baby?

13:57.703 --> 13:58.662
Okay, sit down.

14:01.078 --> 14:02.162
Sit down, eat.

14:04.287 --> 14:05.370
I'm not hungry.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.287
Of course you're hungry, sit down.

14:07.870 --> 14:10.245
- I'll get something later.
- Kid!

14:10.953 --> 14:13.537
Go racing. That'll solve everything.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.870
- Let him go, Katie.
- I was speaking to him.

14:21.203 --> 14:22.162
Kid!

14:35.537 --> 14:36.495
Just start.

14:59.620 --> 15:01.537
If anything happens to him tonight,
it's on you.

15:05.328 --> 15:06.453
Come on, Stevie.

15:17.453 --> 15:18.703
Fucking go!

15:31.828 --> 15:32.870
Fucking go.

16:28.412 --> 16:29.412
Cheers.

16:36.828 --> 16:37.870
Did it start?

16:43.162 --> 16:44.037
Aye.

16:46.912 --> 16:48.120
But it just dies.

16:51.453 --> 16:53.287
Kid thinks it's the alternator.

16:56.120 --> 16:57.120
Does he?

16:58.037 --> 16:59.620
Says we'll get one on eBay.

17:03.995 --> 17:06.203
I'm not on eBay.

17:07.495 --> 17:08.370
I am.

17:24.245 --> 17:25.287
Katie, my can.

17:25.745 --> 17:26.703
Move it then.

17:45.537 --> 17:47.912
- Polish boy will see us.
- He's Latvian.

17:49.745 --> 17:51.120
Latvian boy will see us then.

17:53.745 --> 17:55.537
Do you want to take me in the back?

17:56.203 --> 17:57.162
Katie....

17:58.453 --> 18:00.037
We can just kiss then can't we?

18:13.328 --> 18:14.662
Hey, keep looking at me.

18:39.037 --> 18:40.037
What you doing?

18:40.370 --> 18:41.703
Dad's trying to start the car.

19:29.495 --> 19:30.828
Come and watch the film.

19:31.537 --> 19:33.870
I think I might just listen
to my records for a while, eh?

22:18.620 --> 22:19.787
What you saying, Kid?

22:20.787 --> 22:21.870
Feeling fast?

22:28.578 --> 22:29.828
We need to speak.

22:30.995 --> 22:32.037
Where's Kid?

22:33.995 --> 22:35.037
He's not here.

22:35.745 --> 22:36.745
Where is he?

22:36.953 --> 22:37.912
He's at home.

22:38.662 --> 22:40.203
What are you doing here then?

22:42.078 --> 22:43.078
I was bowling.

22:43.453 --> 22:44.453
No you weren't.

22:44.703 --> 22:45.953
I was thinking about it.

22:46.078 --> 22:47.328
- About bowling?
- Yeah.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.162
You know he dumped me?

22:55.412 --> 22:56.745
When?

22:56.995 --> 22:57.912
Tonight.

22:58.495 --> 22:59.662
On my break.

23:01.037 --> 23:03.453
- Do you want me to take you home?
- No just tell me where he is.

23:03.537 --> 23:05.495
I told you he's at home, he's in his bed.

23:14.912 --> 23:16.328
This is mine, I'm taking it back.

23:24.245 --> 23:25.787
He never even gave me a reason.

23:26.828 --> 23:28.703
Just said he didn't know
about anything anymore.

23:29.287 --> 23:31.162
- I'll take you home.
- No just let me sit here!

23:31.287 --> 23:34.453
I can't sit here with that boy goading me.

23:37.162 --> 23:38.453
Want me to tell him to fuck off?

23:40.912 --> 23:43.370
No, just put your seatbelt on
and we'll go round the "flaggie".

23:57.745 --> 23:59.078
How come you've got Kid's car?

24:00.662 --> 24:01.662
Couldn't sleep.

24:02.995 --> 24:05.287
He told me he'd never let
anybody else drive it.

24:15.037 --> 24:16.370
This boy's not letting me go.

24:18.703 --> 24:20.328
He's tailing you to the bypass.

24:30.453 --> 24:32.328
Sure you don't want me to tell him
to fuck off?

24:34.703 --> 24:35.745
Where do you live?

24:36.453 --> 24:37.537
Don't take me home.

24:37.828 --> 24:39.078
I don't want to go home.

24:43.495 --> 24:44.578
Do you want to race him?

24:49.870 --> 24:51.078
Sure...

24:54.745 --> 24:55.912
If you want to.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.370
I just want to get rid of him.

25:08.328 --> 25:09.620
That's cheating!

25:09.787 --> 25:11.328
He's a fucking cheat!

25:18.453 --> 25:20.120
Come on, come on!

25:59.453 --> 26:00.953
Ah! Look!

26:02.078 --> 26:03.495
He's got nothing left.

26:05.412 --> 26:08.245
Get it up you, Ali Sim!

26:08.495 --> 26:11.828
Tell you who else won't like that is Kid.
Kid's never beaten Ali.

26:11.912 --> 26:13.203
- Has he not?
- Nope.

26:15.078 --> 26:17.120
Aw, he's away home to sulk.

26:51.078 --> 26:52.787
No, no rescuing him...

26:53.078 --> 26:55.745
If you rescue him,
you'll be divorced in three months.

26:56.203 --> 26:57.870
That's true, that's a fact...

27:22.787 --> 27:24.870
He's not replied to any of my messages.

27:27.203 --> 27:28.495
Are we finished?

27:29.162 --> 27:30.287
Do you want this baby?

27:31.078 --> 27:32.828
- Do you want me?
- You should let him sleep.

27:38.870 --> 27:40.912
He doesn't know you've got his car,
does he?

27:41.995 --> 27:43.203
You going to tell him?

27:44.537 --> 27:45.412
Maybe.

27:48.953 --> 27:50.120
Why the fuck should I?

27:55.578 --> 27:56.745
Can I drop you somewhere?

27:59.662 --> 28:02.953
Just drop me back at the leisure centre.
I'll see who else is there.

28:04.495 --> 28:06.745
- I should take you home.
- I don't want to go home.

28:08.870 --> 28:10.662
My mum will be out, and I won't sleep.

28:11.162 --> 28:13.078
I can still hear those bowling balls.

28:38.703 --> 28:40.037
These fucking lights.

28:57.703 --> 29:00.162
My pals usually stay
for a drink after work.

29:00.245 --> 29:02.703
But the noise drives me nuts.

29:03.620 --> 29:05.745
Do you think being pregnant
affects your hearing?

29:09.120 --> 29:11.370
I hadn't thought about
the noise getting to you.

29:11.703 --> 29:12.912
That's not the worst thing.

29:13.370 --> 29:14.745
The worst thing's the shoes.

29:14.995 --> 29:16.412
They make your hands smell.

29:17.537 --> 29:20.078
I bring perfume to work with me
just for my hands.

29:44.037 --> 29:45.370
Do you want to keep going?

29:47.412 --> 29:48.745
Keep driving for a while?

29:52.620 --> 29:54.828
Yeah. Let's keep going.

30:18.245 --> 30:19.745
Do you want to hear some music?

30:21.912 --> 30:23.537
Aye, no,

30:23.995 --> 30:24.870
maybe?

30:25.745 --> 30:27.953
Not if it's about bitches and guns.

30:28.287 --> 30:29.912
I don't listen to that stuff either.

30:47.203 --> 30:48.245
Just wait.

31:27.453 --> 31:30.370
♪ We are made of our longest days ♪

31:30.578 --> 31:33.870
♪ We are falling, but not alone ♪

31:34.537 --> 31:38.287
♪ We will take the best parts
of ourselves ♪

31:38.453 --> 31:40.412
♪ And make them gold ♪

31:40.495 --> 31:43.453
♪ We are made of our smallest thoughts ♪

31:43.745 --> 31:47.162
♪ We are breathing and letting go ♪

31:47.745 --> 31:51.120
♪ We will take the best parts
of ourselves ♪

31:51.287 --> 31:54.328
♪ And make them gold ♪

32:09.453 --> 32:10.703
You cold?

32:11.620 --> 32:12.870
Not too bad.

32:16.120 --> 32:17.370
I'm always cold.

32:17.870 --> 32:19.328
Except when I'm in bed.

32:19.995 --> 32:21.578
Then I'm a human radiator.

32:23.162 --> 32:25.953
Kid said he saw a heat shimmer
coming off me one time.

32:26.662 --> 32:27.953
You know a heat shimmer?

32:28.662 --> 32:32.245
Like in a desert, or off a bonfire?

32:38.745 --> 32:40.537
I'm going to shut up and let you drive.

32:50.453 --> 32:52.245
Will we cut him loose?

32:53.828 --> 32:56.328
I don't want to be responsible
for them getting divorced.

33:19.912 --> 33:22.078
Wanna see if I can get us another a race?

33:23.453 --> 33:24.953
They still race the breakwater?

33:26.245 --> 33:27.787
I think it's still roped off.

33:28.620 --> 33:29.662
But I'll ask.

33:53.203 --> 33:54.328
What colour is it?

33:55.328 --> 33:56.245
Orange.

33:58.495 --> 33:59.495
Orange?

34:00.078 --> 34:01.037
Maybe red?

34:02.495 --> 34:03.787
I've only seen it at night.

34:09.120 --> 34:10.120
They're not here.

34:23.078 --> 34:24.245
Can we stop for chips?

34:27.370 --> 34:28.662
I've not had any supper.

34:30.953 --> 34:32.412
I won't eat them in the car.

34:44.578 --> 34:45.620
You want anything?

34:46.203 --> 34:47.495
I already ate.

34:48.578 --> 34:49.912
Are you going to drive away?

34:51.578 --> 34:52.912
I'll just go round the harbour.

34:54.370 --> 34:55.787
Will you come back?

34:57.412 --> 34:58.828
Yeah, I'll come back.

35:56.037 --> 35:57.578
- They texted me.
- What did they say?

35:57.703 --> 35:58.995
Said to wait by the containers.

35:59.328 --> 36:01.037
- Did you get your chips?
- No, it's okay.

36:01.328 --> 36:03.537
Do you want me to drop you back
at the leisure centre?

36:03.703 --> 36:05.578
No, they don't know you, you need me!

36:53.828 --> 36:54.995
Suppose we just wait?

36:57.662 --> 36:58.662
They're at a party.

37:00.287 --> 37:01.162
A party?

37:03.037 --> 37:03.912
Aye.

37:04.995 --> 37:06.162
But she said they'd be down.

37:17.287 --> 37:18.412
Do you have a cigarette?

37:20.703 --> 37:21.578
No.

37:22.870 --> 37:23.745
What?

37:25.328 --> 37:26.995
You think I should keep this baby now?

37:28.995 --> 37:31.287
- Don't ask me, Kelly.
- But I am asking you.

37:32.662 --> 37:34.037
You should speak to him.

37:48.995 --> 37:50.245
Show me where you race, then.

37:50.745 --> 37:51.953
You're looking at it.

37:53.828 --> 37:55.078
Just up and back?

37:57.412 --> 37:58.495
Just up and back.

38:01.953 --> 38:02.870
Show me.

38:04.495 --> 38:06.120
Hey.

38:06.203 --> 38:07.162
Here.

38:22.828 --> 38:24.328
Are you going to kill us?

38:26.287 --> 38:27.162
No.

38:27.245 --> 38:29.620
By accident,
are you going to kill us?

38:32.787 --> 38:33.703
No.

38:35.703 --> 38:37.537
I don't believe you can race here.

38:37.662 --> 38:39.287
I thought you'd done this before.

38:39.537 --> 38:41.037
Nope, first time.

38:43.745 --> 38:44.745
Are you scared?

38:48.828 --> 38:50.745
If he knew we were down here together...

39:19.328 --> 39:20.745
Imagine going down in that.

39:22.037 --> 39:23.370
There's worse ways to go.

39:24.328 --> 39:25.287
Like what?

39:27.037 --> 39:27.995
Anything slow.

39:33.953 --> 39:35.328
Town looks pretty from here.

39:47.495 --> 39:48.662
Kelly, don't.

39:48.745 --> 39:50.953
- I won't send it to anyone.
- Don't take my picture.

39:51.037 --> 39:53.203
- Although can you imagine?
- Kelly don't, it's not funny.

39:53.287 --> 39:55.328
- Stay there and I'll get his car in.
- It's not funny!

39:56.453 --> 39:58.370
What if I want him to know you're
here with me?

39:58.537 --> 39:59.995
Give me that phone!

40:02.662 --> 40:04.662
Do you want me
to throw it in the water, eh?

40:08.037 --> 40:09.037
Fuck me.

40:10.953 --> 40:12.453
You're the double of him just now.

40:15.578 --> 40:17.745
Throw it in, I don't care.

40:27.703 --> 40:30.787
- Kelly, put it in your pocket.
- Did you make sure I didn't take one?

40:32.037 --> 40:33.370
Go ahead, check.

40:34.953 --> 40:38.953
But you might see some of me I sent to Kid
on Valentine's. Parts of me, anyway.

41:12.495 --> 41:13.495
Cheers.

41:36.078 --> 41:38.662
How can someone love one you day
and not love you the next?

41:42.245 --> 41:44.412
Every person I've ever loved I still love.

41:46.787 --> 41:47.745
I'm like a dog.

42:06.870 --> 42:08.870
- All right!
- No, it's not all right!

42:25.620 --> 42:27.703
Fuck this, what do we need them
for anyway?

42:27.953 --> 42:30.203
- Where we going?
- Going to race this fucking wall.

42:30.453 --> 42:31.995
- What, just us?
- Yeah.

42:32.495 --> 42:33.828
- You ready?
- Wait.

42:40.828 --> 42:41.828
You need to say it.

42:48.245 --> 42:49.162
Go.

43:57.078 --> 43:57.995
Is that it?

44:00.620 --> 44:02.787
Do you want me to go again?
I can do it faster.

44:38.203 --> 44:40.120
- You okay?
- I need to move.

44:40.912 --> 44:43.162
- I need to get my temperature up.
- Get back in the car then.

44:43.245 --> 44:44.453
No, I need to move.

44:44.662 --> 44:45.912
I want to dance.

44:46.203 --> 44:47.745
Will you come to Deejays with me?

44:48.078 --> 44:49.620
- Deejays?
- Yeah.

44:50.328 --> 44:51.203
We'll still get in.

44:51.370 --> 44:53.662
- You go if you want.
- Will you come with me?

44:53.995 --> 44:55.537
I'll take you if that's what you want.

44:55.870 --> 44:57.328
But will you come in with me?

44:58.787 --> 44:59.828
No, Kelly.

45:02.037 --> 45:03.203
Forget it then.

45:04.620 --> 45:06.620
- I thought you wanted to dance?
- Not by myself.

45:08.287 --> 45:10.203
Do you want me to take you up there
or not?

45:10.787 --> 45:13.495
You can't just drop me there and then
go home like I never existed.

45:16.578 --> 45:18.370
I never said I was going home.

45:32.495 --> 45:33.828
So where do you want to go?

45:37.287 --> 45:38.495
I want to get out of here.

45:41.120 --> 45:42.078
I'll go with you.

45:49.870 --> 45:51.787
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

45:52.870 --> 45:54.828
- You want to leave the town.
- Tonight.

45:54.953 --> 45:56.037
Tonight.

45:58.912 --> 46:00.203
And not come back, Kelly.

46:01.995 --> 46:02.912
I get it.

46:04.620 --> 46:05.495
Let's go.

47:45.370 --> 47:46.912
I've only been away with the school.

47:49.495 --> 47:50.703
Do you want to back out?

47:53.037 --> 47:54.328
Do you want to back out?

47:56.328 --> 47:57.662
I said I was coming with you.

47:58.620 --> 47:59.620
Okay.

48:03.495 --> 48:04.662
Here, this is my house.

48:12.870 --> 48:14.328
I'll just go in for a minute.

48:14.745 --> 48:17.870
I'm thinking what I need to bring. Where
we going, in case I want to leave a note?

48:18.578 --> 48:20.245
Just say you'll call tomorrow
or the next day.

48:20.328 --> 48:22.537
- Is that how long it'll take to get there?
- There's no "there".

48:22.620 --> 48:23.578
Okay, sorry.

48:26.203 --> 48:28.370
We're just going to keep driving till
we find some place we like

48:28.453 --> 48:30.037
and then we'll move on again
once we're bored.

48:31.203 --> 48:33.328
I'll pick up work from place to place,
just depends what I find.

48:34.078 --> 48:34.995
I'll work too.

48:36.370 --> 48:38.120
I was thinking maybe seasonal work for me.

48:38.912 --> 48:40.578
I can work outside so long as I'm warm.

48:40.870 --> 48:42.203
But that's the kind of thing
I need to know,

48:42.287 --> 48:43.703
because it helps with
my packing decisions.

48:43.953 --> 48:45.453
I don't want to be up there deciding
for long.

48:45.537 --> 48:46.578
We can buy stuff.

48:46.662 --> 48:48.745
But there's no point wasting money,
I'm just being practical.

48:48.828 --> 48:50.620
- Practical's good.
- I'll be the practical one then.

48:51.787 --> 48:53.912
And you can teach me to drive?

48:55.453 --> 48:56.495
Yeah, sure.

48:58.662 --> 49:04.162
But listen, if we find some place you like
and you want to stay, but I don't...

49:05.287 --> 49:06.620
That's okay too, right?

49:07.370 --> 49:08.453
Yeah, that's okay.

49:10.037 --> 49:11.162
No strings attached.

49:12.995 --> 49:13.953
Exactly.

49:22.287 --> 49:23.745
I'll just be a few minutes then.

54:52.828 --> 54:53.870
Where'd you go?

54:57.287 --> 54:58.370
Nowhere.

55:12.370 --> 55:14.120
We didn't run very far, did we?

55:15.995 --> 55:16.870
Guess not.

55:19.953 --> 55:21.162
I'm getting mine removed.

55:24.787 --> 55:25.828
Where'd you go?

55:28.120 --> 55:29.912
I took Kid's car for a drive.

55:30.120 --> 55:31.120
I know that.

55:33.412 --> 55:34.412
Does he?

55:35.620 --> 55:36.745
What do you think?

55:38.662 --> 55:40.037
So, you angry at me?

55:43.537 --> 55:44.745
I'd have gone with you.

55:47.662 --> 55:48.745
If you'd asked.

55:51.537 --> 55:53.162
Would you really have come with me?

55:56.787 --> 55:58.495
I should go to bed.
I've got work in the morning.

56:07.620 --> 56:09.870
Do you remember when
we raced the breakwater?

56:11.620 --> 56:12.787
Is that where you went?

56:16.037 --> 56:17.203
Do you remember after?

56:19.245 --> 56:20.245
I remember.

56:22.703 --> 56:23.870
What do you remember?

56:27.578 --> 56:29.412
- I remember being cold.
- Mm.

56:32.037 --> 56:33.828
- And drunk.
- Mm.

56:37.537 --> 56:38.537
And arrogant.

56:42.037 --> 56:43.412
We weren't arrogant.

56:44.912 --> 56:47.037
You were the most arrogant boy
I'd ever met.

56:48.578 --> 56:49.578
That tickles.

56:55.120 --> 56:56.620
Tell me what you liked about me.

56:57.745 --> 56:59.328
I can tell you what I like about you now.

57:10.537 --> 57:12.453
I'm sick of
looking at these boxes.

57:14.578 --> 57:15.828
I'm going to bed.

57:16.453 --> 57:18.037
- Do you hear me?
- I hear you.

57:19.787 --> 57:21.537
Well we need to put them somewhere.

57:21.870 --> 57:23.245
We did, we put them here.

57:23.578 --> 57:25.495
Well I don't want to look at them anymore.

57:25.578 --> 57:27.620
Okay, we'll move them, I don't know where
but we'll move them.

57:27.703 --> 57:28.953
Fuck that, I'll chuck them out.

57:29.787 --> 57:31.787
I don't care what's in them,
it's all worthless.

57:33.245 --> 57:35.203
Do you want to do it now?
Come on, we'll do it now.

57:49.870 --> 57:51.120
You'll wake the boys.

57:51.203 --> 57:53.370
That's alright, they can go
in a bag as well.

57:58.578 --> 58:00.078
Wanna see if I fit in one?

58:03.953 --> 58:05.245
Maybe one for my head?

58:09.370 --> 58:11.370
I've run out of ways to help you.

58:12.203 --> 58:13.203
You'll suffocate.

58:14.078 --> 58:15.287
And you'll watch me.

58:19.578 --> 58:21.578
Stop trying to help me!

58:21.787 --> 58:23.120
I'm not wanting your help.

58:23.203 --> 58:24.703
Good, because you're not
getting it anymore.

58:24.787 --> 58:26.495
- I should be helping you.
- So help me then.

58:26.912 --> 58:27.870
Be a man!

58:28.162 --> 58:29.787
Come on, fucking help me!

59:04.828 --> 59:07.162
I remember you used to ask me
to run away with you.

59:12.745 --> 59:13.953
Leave town together.

59:20.828 --> 59:21.745
Yeah.

59:25.662 --> 59:26.995
But you wouldn't come.

59:29.995 --> 59:31.370
It was never about that for me.

59:35.703 --> 59:37.620
I just thought it was another way
to say I love you.

1:00:02.287 --> 1:00:03.287
Go then.

1:00:07.495 --> 1:00:08.662
Nobody's stopping you.

1:00:59.287 --> 1:01:00.370
What you looking for?

1:01:00.995 --> 1:01:02.120
Little red screwdriver.

1:01:03.078 --> 1:01:04.162
What for?

1:01:04.495 --> 1:01:05.495
Table leg.

1:01:10.828 --> 1:01:11.912
What happened to it?

1:01:12.953 --> 1:01:13.870
It just collapsed.

1:01:14.120 --> 1:01:15.620
Did it fuck just collapse.

1:01:18.745 --> 1:01:20.370
- Did you kick it?
- No.

1:01:20.495 --> 1:01:21.828
Did you kick this leg out?

1:01:23.870 --> 1:01:26.370
- Might have caught it with my foot.
- You fucking might have.

1:01:36.328 --> 1:01:38.662
- There's no screwdrivers in there.
- So where is it then?

1:01:40.037 --> 1:01:41.037
It's in the garage.

1:01:45.412 --> 1:01:46.745
What happened to all those boxes?

1:01:50.870 --> 1:01:51.995
They just collapsed.

1:02:13.662 --> 1:02:16.245
Dad, there's no toilet roll!

1:03:00.078 --> 1:03:01.912
- You got any plans today?
- No.

1:03:06.870 --> 1:03:08.203
You seeing Kelly?

1:03:10.453 --> 1:03:11.745
Don't think so.

1:03:16.037 --> 1:03:17.287
Is she working or...?

1:03:20.953 --> 1:03:22.245
She's not speaking to me.

1:03:27.662 --> 1:03:29.037
Why's she not speaking to you?

1:03:30.787 --> 1:03:32.662
Because I fucked up the relationship,
all right?

1:03:34.578 --> 1:03:35.662
You happy now?

1:03:38.703 --> 1:03:39.578
No.

1:03:45.537 --> 1:03:46.495
Aye, you are.

1:03:54.162 --> 1:03:56.495
- I need to tell you something.
- I don't want to hear it, Dad.

1:04:01.370 --> 1:04:02.620
Will you just give me a minute?

1:04:03.662 --> 1:04:04.995
I'm not interested, Dad.

1:04:05.953 --> 1:04:07.912
I mean, you act like
it's the only job in town.

1:04:08.412 --> 1:04:09.370
And it's not.

1:04:11.495 --> 1:04:12.578
Where you going?

1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:13.995
Nowhere.

1:04:41.287 --> 1:04:42.287
Bye, Dad.

1:04:42.953 --> 1:04:43.870
Bye, Stevie.

1:04:44.870 --> 1:04:45.995
Uh, Stevie!

1:04:47.620 --> 1:04:48.620
What?

1:04:49.745 --> 1:04:52.495
- Are you wanting any breakfast?
- I need to go.

1:04:53.578 --> 1:04:56.537
- Waffles or something?
- Can I have them when I get back?

1:04:58.745 --> 1:04:59.953
Yeah, go to football.

1:05:05.578 --> 1:05:06.495
Steve...

1:05:47.578 --> 1:05:48.953
Were you in my car last night?

1:05:51.828 --> 1:05:52.870
Yeah, I was.

1:05:55.078 --> 1:05:56.037
With Kelly?

1:05:57.203 --> 1:05:58.828
She was looking for you, Kid.

1:07:54.995 --> 1:07:56.245
Why'd you do it?

1:07:58.120 --> 1:07:59.203
Take my car out.

1:08:01.078 --> 1:08:03.245
I don't know, why do you do it?

1:08:06.995 --> 1:08:07.995
Speak about me?

1:08:12.412 --> 1:08:13.787
That girl loves you.

1:08:14.870 --> 1:08:17.245
She loved me a month ago when
I told you she was pregnant.

1:08:21.578 --> 1:08:23.328
Am I not allowed to have what you have?

1:08:25.537 --> 1:08:27.745
You can go anywhere you want.

1:08:28.037 --> 1:08:28.912
Go where?

1:08:29.995 --> 1:08:30.995
Do anything.

1:08:31.537 --> 1:08:32.537
And do what?

1:08:33.328 --> 1:08:34.912
Something, anything.

1:08:37.453 --> 1:08:39.787
Instead of nothing, which is what I do.

1:08:42.537 --> 1:08:43.662
Which is what I am.

1:08:52.537 --> 1:08:53.703
So are we nothing?

1:08:54.745 --> 1:08:55.828
Is Mum nothing?

1:08:56.578 --> 1:08:57.453
No.

1:08:59.495 --> 1:09:00.578
Neither's Kelly.

1:09:06.995 --> 1:09:08.037
She's something.

1:09:27.703 --> 1:09:29.120
Is Mum needing picked up?

1:09:41.412 --> 1:09:42.495
She never said.

1:10:03.703 --> 1:10:06.245
I don't want to talk to you.

1:11:14.245 --> 1:11:16.037
You just missed her.
