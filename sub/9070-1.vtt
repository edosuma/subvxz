04:05.250 --> 04:09.687
- Do you think they'll come, sir?
- They'll come, all right.

04:09.850 --> 04:12.318
Here. Stamp those and mail them.

04:50.130 --> 04:51.643
It's ringing.

04:51.810 --> 04:56.600
Would you walk Myron the other way?
My leg looks like a tree in this fog.

04:56.770 --> 04:58.123
Come on.

04:59.450 --> 05:02.408
What a godforsaken spot to get lost.

05:02.570 --> 05:06.449
It's true. I saw a much better spot
a few miles back.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.842
Hello?

05:21.490 --> 05:23.879
Good.
Tell them we're lost.

05:31.490 --> 05:34.163
- The phone's dead.
- Why'd you say "hello"?

05:34.330 --> 05:35.968
- I could've sworn...
- What?

05:36.130 --> 05:39.520
- Sounded like somebody snipped the wire.
- Really?

05:39.690 --> 05:42.045
What did it sound like?

05:42.210 --> 05:43.723
Snip.

05:49.290 --> 05:53.203
- Some fog, eh, Pop?
- I've already heard the weather report.

05:53.370 --> 05:54.723
Drive, please.

05:54.890 --> 05:56.926
It's as thick as pea soup.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.921
Not a soul around for miles.

05:59.090 --> 06:02.082
Know what I think?
Perfect place for a murder.

06:02.250 --> 06:06.243
Conversation like television set
on honeymoon:

06:06.410 --> 06:07.638
Unnecessary.

06:41.490 --> 06:43.606
Where are we going, anyway, Pop?

06:43.770 --> 06:48.480
Who is this Mr. Twain?
What'd he mean, "dinner and a murder"?

06:48.650 --> 06:51.210
Questions like athlete's foot:

06:51.370 --> 06:54.487
After a while, very irritating.

06:56.530 --> 06:57.929
To stop car, please.

06:58.090 --> 07:00.206
- What's wrong?
- Stop car, please.

07:03.370 --> 07:05.281
To shut engine off, please.

07:06.970 --> 07:08.369
Listen.

07:09.090 --> 07:11.650
I don't hear nothing.
What do you hear?

07:11.810 --> 07:15.359
- Double negative and dog.
- So it's a dog. So what?

07:15.530 --> 07:17.043
If not mistaken...

07:17.210 --> 07:19.770
...dog belong to Mr. Dick Charleston.

07:19.930 --> 07:22.080
- Who's Dick Charleston?
- I am.

07:22.250 --> 07:25.606
You don't happen to have seen
a little white... Wang!

07:25.770 --> 07:27.044
A white Wang?

07:27.210 --> 07:30.919
Sidney Wang! What are you
doing in this godforsaken spot?

07:31.090 --> 07:32.842
No doubt, same as you.

07:33.010 --> 07:37.367
Looking for bridge that lead
to home of host, Mr. Lionel Twain.

07:37.530 --> 07:38.530
You too, huh?

07:38.690 --> 07:41.602
Must be important to invite
two such detectives.

07:41.770 --> 07:45.001
Excuse, please, to introduce
Japanese son, Willie.

07:46.170 --> 07:47.762
Japanese?
But I thought...

07:47.930 --> 07:50.444
Mrs. Wang and I
couldn't have children.

07:50.610 --> 07:52.805
Willie: Adopted number three son.

07:52.970 --> 07:55.200
Careful on this road.
It's treacherous.

07:55.370 --> 07:58.601
Treacherous road like fresh mushroom.
Must always...

07:58.770 --> 08:02.160
Idiot! Not finish mushroom story.

08:02.330 --> 08:03.888
You're idiot!

08:10.610 --> 08:15.206
Sorry, but I see nothing.
This fog's as thick as bouillabaisse.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.122
- Nuts!
- I beg your pardon?

08:17.290 --> 08:20.646
Nuts, nuts! There are
no nuts in my chocolate!

08:20.810 --> 08:24.405
You let that imbecile in the shop
give you raisins.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.208
He didn't have any nuts.

08:27.090 --> 08:31.003
- The man in the shop?
- That's the reason I took the raisins.

08:31.170 --> 08:33.047
Never mind.

08:33.210 --> 08:35.849
We'll soon be there for dinner.
Hot soup.

08:36.010 --> 08:38.967
Something is not right
in all of this, huh?

08:39.130 --> 08:40.927
I can feel it in my bones.

08:42.450 --> 08:44.759
- In your what?
- In my bones.

08:45.810 --> 08:47.766
Buns? You have buns?

08:47.930 --> 08:50.285
You bought buns
and didn't tell me?

08:50.490 --> 08:52.765
- Where are the buns?
- No, monsieur.

08:52.930 --> 08:55.000
The bones in my body.

08:55.170 --> 08:59.049
You shouldn't speak with an accent
when you know I'm hungry.

09:07.530 --> 09:10.602
If you ask me, Sam,
this is a wild goose chase.

09:10.770 --> 09:12.920
- Nobody asked you.
- Yes, they did.

09:13.090 --> 09:15.684
You asked me back there
if I thought...

09:15.850 --> 09:17.602
That was then. This is now.

09:17.770 --> 09:19.965
Nobody knows
what tomorrow will be.

09:20.130 --> 09:23.247
That's the way it is,
whether we like it or not.

09:23.410 --> 09:26.083
Sam, I really worry
about you sometimes.

09:26.250 --> 09:29.447
Cut the malarkey.
This trip is strictly business.

09:29.610 --> 09:33.808
- What do you got on Twain?
- He was born in San Francisco in 1906.

09:33.970 --> 09:36.928
His mother was Catholic,
father an Orthodox Jew.

09:37.090 --> 09:39.240
They separated two hours
after the marriage.

09:39.410 --> 09:42.129
- Any children?
- Yeah, one daughter, 32.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.645
Her name's Irene,
but she goes by Rita.

09:44.810 --> 09:48.564
Just like a dame.
Don't stop, angel. You're doing fine.

09:48.730 --> 09:52.609
He was arrested in 1932
for selling pornographic bibles.

09:52.770 --> 09:56.399
Charges were dropped when the
church didn't turn over the bibles.

09:56.570 --> 10:01.360
There's nothing on him until '46
when he was picked up in El Paso...

10:01.530 --> 10:05.079
...for smuggling a truckload
of rich, white Americans...

10:05.250 --> 10:07.206
...into Mexico to pick melons.

10:07.370 --> 10:10.680
He was sent to the state hospital
for mental observation.

10:10.850 --> 10:14.968
I think we picked ourselves
a queer bird, angel. Anything else?

10:15.130 --> 10:16.927
Yeah. Get this, Sam.

10:17.090 --> 10:21.686
Twain has one interesting physical
characteristic. He has no pinkies.

10:22.890 --> 10:26.769
No pinkies?
Twain's only got eight fingers?

10:26.930 --> 10:30.843
No, no. He's got 10.
He just doesn't have any pinkies.

10:31.010 --> 10:33.729
- You did your homework good.
- Thanks.

10:33.890 --> 10:37.200
- Where'd you dig that up?
- I wrote Twain and asked.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.201
Good thinking.

10:41.210 --> 10:44.725
- What's the matter?
- Wouldn't you know, out of gas.

10:46.650 --> 10:50.438
I saw a station
about five miles back, Sam.

10:51.810 --> 10:55.485
I want you to know I'm gonna be
waiting for you, baby.

11:06.290 --> 11:09.919
Here's the bridge, Pop.
Doesn't look safe to me.

11:10.090 --> 11:12.923
One way to find out.
Drive across.

11:13.090 --> 11:15.320
Aren't you gonna come with me?

11:15.490 --> 11:18.448
Weight of two men
may be too much for bridge.

11:18.610 --> 11:20.441
Then why do I get to drive?

11:20.610 --> 11:24.364
Because I smart enough
to get out first.

11:38.570 --> 11:41.403
I'm not gonna make it.
It's gonna collapse.

11:41.570 --> 11:44.801
Not worry.
Father find other way to house.

11:56.490 --> 11:58.526
I made it, Pop!
I made it!

11:58.690 --> 12:02.968
Good! Good!
Now come back and get adopted father.

12:05.930 --> 12:08.842
Look at invitation.
What number of house?

12:09.010 --> 12:11.160
- Two-two...
- Correct.

12:11.330 --> 12:12.763
2-2, Twain's house.

12:12.930 --> 12:14.249
Continue.

12:38.810 --> 12:40.766
- Did you see that?
- No.

12:40.930 --> 12:42.966
Neither did I.

12:48.970 --> 12:51.803
Stop! Do not move.

12:51.970 --> 12:53.881
Something's wrong here.

12:54.050 --> 12:57.167
- What is it?
- Do not ask questions. Do as I say.

12:57.330 --> 13:00.049
When I tell you jump, you jump.

13:00.210 --> 13:02.485
One, two, three...

13:03.290 --> 13:04.848
...jump!

13:05.810 --> 13:07.528
Holy Shanghai!

13:08.810 --> 13:11.085
Nice counting.
But how'd you know?

13:11.250 --> 13:12.569
Look on ground.

13:15.690 --> 13:17.681
Even had correct shoe size.

13:17.850 --> 13:19.806
Someone gone great trouble...

13:19.970 --> 13:23.485
...to make welcome guests
not so welcome.

13:23.650 --> 13:25.163
Ring bell, please.

13:25.330 --> 13:28.163
Are you nuts?
Someone's trying to kill us.

13:28.330 --> 13:32.323
Yes. Should make exciting weekend.
Ring, please.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.679
I wish it was Monday morning.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.208
Well, here goes.

13:41.210 --> 13:43.405
They're killing someone in there!

13:43.570 --> 13:46.528
- Calm yourself.
- Didn't you hear her scream?

13:46.690 --> 13:48.203
No. You heard scream.

13:48.370 --> 13:51.123
More experienced ear heard doorbell.

13:51.290 --> 13:52.689
Listen again.

13:57.370 --> 14:02.125
Mr. Twain has
macabre sense of humour, yeah?

14:23.090 --> 14:25.843
Good evening.
We have been expecting you.

14:26.010 --> 14:29.889
But in what condition?
Roof in need of repair.

14:30.050 --> 14:34.123
Indeed. I'm afraid
the house is falling apart.

14:35.410 --> 14:39.483
- May we come in, please?
- I'm sorry. I thought you were in.

14:39.650 --> 14:42.722
You are Mr. And Mrs. Charleston?

14:42.890 --> 14:44.482
Not quite.

14:44.650 --> 14:47.926
I am Inspector Wang
of Catalina, please.

14:48.090 --> 14:50.285
This adopted son, Willie.

14:51.570 --> 14:55.006
I trust you had a pleasant journey
despite the storm?

15:06.370 --> 15:08.008
Strange weather.

15:08.170 --> 15:11.765
Storm only outside when inside.

15:11.930 --> 15:15.764
That. That's just one
of Mr. Twain's little toys.

15:15.930 --> 15:17.568
An electronic device.

15:17.730 --> 15:20.290
Mr. Twain,
as you will soon discover...

15:20.450 --> 15:22.918
...prefers his atmosphere murky.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.888
- May I have your bags, sir?
- No, no.

15:26.050 --> 15:29.281
Son will get bags.
That is why I adopted him.

15:29.450 --> 15:30.963
Very good, sir.

15:31.130 --> 15:34.361
One moment, please,
while I close the door.

15:37.370 --> 15:41.807
Now, if you will follow me,
I will show you to your room.

15:52.330 --> 15:55.640
Very large house.
No other servants?

15:55.810 --> 15:59.485
I'm not sure.
I've never seen anyone.

16:01.610 --> 16:05.364
Mr. Twain asked me to see
that you're made comfortable...

16:05.530 --> 16:08.283
...and to say he'll
join you after dinner.

16:08.450 --> 16:12.159
After dinner?
Host not have dinner with guests?

16:12.330 --> 16:16.039
No. Mr. Twain prefers to eat out.

16:28.890 --> 16:33.645
- Wait, please. What that?
- That? It nothing. Just the cat.

16:35.570 --> 16:37.083
That cat?

16:37.250 --> 16:40.003
You feed cat dog food?

16:40.170 --> 16:42.638
I'm afraid he's
a very angry cat, sir.

16:42.810 --> 16:46.439
Mr. Twain had him fixed,
and he didn't want to be.

16:49.010 --> 16:50.728
Big house, huh, Pop?

16:50.890 --> 16:53.882
Big house like man
married to fat woman:

16:54.050 --> 16:55.881
Hard to get around.

16:56.050 --> 17:00.487
Here we are.
I'm sure you'll find this suitable.

17:00.650 --> 17:03.483
- It's a cold house.
- I've taken care of that.

17:03.650 --> 17:07.643
You'll find a nice, cosy fire
in your room.

17:24.650 --> 17:26.208
It's a bit smoky, sir.

17:26.369 --> 17:29.760
I'm afraid that fireplace
hasn't been used in years.

17:29.930 --> 17:34.640
- At least the bed will be warm.
- If you wish anything, please ring.

17:34.810 --> 17:38.962
- Where buzzer?
- It's behind the bed, sir, there.

17:39.130 --> 17:40.802
Dinner will be at 9:00...

17:40.970 --> 17:43.928
...and Mr. Twain
likes his guests to dress.

17:46.290 --> 17:48.360
The doorbell. Excuse me.

17:51.650 --> 17:53.129
Wow! What a creepy guy.

17:53.290 --> 17:56.202
Why would anyone want to hire
a blind butler?

17:56.370 --> 17:58.326
For one thing, very cheap.

17:58.490 --> 18:02.278
How butler know
how much he get paid?

18:04.850 --> 18:06.886
Drink this. You'll feel better.

18:07.050 --> 18:10.486
If Myron hadn't barked,
we'd have missed the statue falling.

18:10.650 --> 18:13.244
It wasn't meant to kill.
It's a warning.

18:13.410 --> 18:15.048
Somebody's trying
to frighten us. Why?

18:15.210 --> 18:17.599
Whatever his reason,
he's doing well.

18:17.770 --> 18:21.922
- Why hasn't anybody answered?
- Don't ring it! Knock, don't ring.

18:22.090 --> 18:23.569
I won't, I promise.

18:30.970 --> 18:34.645
- What is it now, Myron?
- Up there, Dora. Look.

18:34.970 --> 18:39.486
- A blind butler.
- Don't let him park the car, Dickie.

18:45.410 --> 18:48.641
Good evening.
We have been expecting you.

18:48.810 --> 18:51.768
We let ourselves in.
Dick and Dora Charleston.

18:51.930 --> 18:54.763
Good evening.
We have been expecting you.

18:55.970 --> 19:00.043
Your room is ready,
if you'll just follow me, please.

19:00.330 --> 19:03.766
Don't mind him. It's just the cat.

19:06.770 --> 19:10.240
- We left our luggage in the trunk.
- I'll get it later...

19:10.410 --> 19:12.878
...when I park the car.

19:15.250 --> 19:19.880
- Was that Mr. Wang's car out front?
- Yes. They're resting in their room.

19:20.050 --> 19:23.486
I've put you in the same wing
as Mr. Wang.

19:23.650 --> 19:26.767
Isn't that nice?
We're in Wang's wing.

19:34.290 --> 19:37.168
Not many people come
to the manor these days.

19:37.330 --> 19:39.366
It's nice to hear guests again.

19:39.530 --> 19:41.521
- Thanks. You are?
- Bensonmum.

19:41.690 --> 19:43.043
Thank you, Benson.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.166
Bensonmum.
My name is Bensonmum.

19:46.330 --> 19:49.447
- Bensonmum?
- Yes, sir. Jamesir Bensonmum.

19:49.610 --> 19:51.362
- Jamesir?
- Yes, sir.

19:51.530 --> 19:53.680
- Jamesir Bensonmum?
- Yes, sir.

19:53.850 --> 19:56.239
- How odd.
- My father's name, sir.

19:56.410 --> 19:58.241
What was your father's name?

19:58.410 --> 20:01.129
- Howard Bensonmum.
- Howard Bensonmum?

20:01.290 --> 20:03.042
Leave it. I've had enough.

20:03.210 --> 20:06.168
Here we are.
The late Mrs. Twain's room.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.002
She died in here.

20:08.170 --> 20:09.888
- Oh, dear.
- Died of what?

20:10.050 --> 20:13.008
She murdered herself
in her sleep, sir.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.081
- You mean suicide?
- Oh, no.

20:15.250 --> 20:17.241
It was murder, all right.

20:17.410 --> 20:20.163
Mrs. Twain hated herself.

20:20.330 --> 20:22.605
We keep this room locked.

20:22.770 --> 20:26.160
- Why is that?
- Mr. Twain loved her very much.

20:26.330 --> 20:30.721
He's kept her room just as it was
the night she choked herself...

20:30.890 --> 20:33.245
...nine years ago.

20:41.730 --> 20:43.607
Madam loved it here.

20:43.770 --> 20:47.524
She said it was
the cheeriest room in the house.

20:51.410 --> 20:54.208
- The doorbell.
- That was Mrs. Charleston.

20:54.370 --> 20:56.600
- I thought she was here.
- I am.

20:56.770 --> 20:59.409
I will not stay in this filthy room.

20:59.570 --> 21:03.119
Very well, madam.
I'll attend to it during dinner.

21:03.290 --> 21:05.281
- Thank you, Benson, sir.
- Mum!

21:05.450 --> 21:08.760
- What?
- Bensonmum. Ma'am.

21:14.930 --> 21:16.329
Baking flour.

21:16.490 --> 21:19.050
- What?
- This dust is baking flour.

21:19.210 --> 21:21.519
And these cobwebs... Candied sugar.

21:21.690 --> 21:25.000
All placed here for the purpose
of frightening us.

21:25.170 --> 21:28.207
And that mouse...
Obviously a mechanical toy.

21:31.730 --> 21:33.846
- Silly.
- What is?

21:34.010 --> 21:36.399
I am. It's real.

21:42.210 --> 21:45.680
- Stop the car. We're here.
- That's why I stopped.

21:45.850 --> 21:48.683
- Open my door.
- You have chocolate on your face.

21:48.850 --> 21:50.727
The candy bar's on your face.

21:50.890 --> 21:54.724
- Imbecile, that's my moustache!
- Lick it and see.

21:57.570 --> 22:00.642
Wipe it off.
My hands are sticky.

22:03.570 --> 22:06.004
Hold still, please.

22:06.170 --> 22:08.126
Sloppy.

22:13.570 --> 22:15.242
All in good time.

22:21.810 --> 22:23.846
Yes?

22:24.010 --> 22:25.443
Who's there?

22:27.490 --> 22:29.162
Who's there, I say?

22:32.970 --> 22:35.165
Filthy neighbourhood.

22:35.330 --> 22:36.922
Didn't I say "jump"?

22:37.090 --> 22:40.287
<i>"Un, deux, trois,</i> jump."
Why don't you listen?

22:40.450 --> 22:43.089
- Leave me alone.
- Sloppy.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.882
Who are you?

23:07.410 --> 23:11.608
You must be the new kitchen maid.
I hope you can cook.

23:12.610 --> 23:14.726
Answer me. Speak up.

23:18.770 --> 23:22.046
What's that?
I can't hear you.

23:22.210 --> 23:25.486
A little shy, are you?
Never mind.

23:27.090 --> 23:29.160
There will be 10 for dinner.

23:31.650 --> 23:33.481
Here is the menu.

23:45.570 --> 23:49.040
Is that understood?
And dinner will be at 9:00.

23:49.210 --> 23:53.283
When I want you, that bell on the wall
will ring three times.

23:53.450 --> 23:55.566
All right. Get to work.

24:04.850 --> 24:08.081
Operator.
I am saying, "Hello, hello."

24:08.250 --> 24:10.400
- It's dead, sir.
- What?

24:10.570 --> 24:12.401
Who is? Who are you?

24:12.570 --> 24:13.889
The butler, sir.

24:14.050 --> 24:17.201
The butler, eh?
I thought as much.

24:17.370 --> 24:21.045
That phone has been out of order
for the past week, sir.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.643
Is that a fact?

24:22.810 --> 24:26.803
And I say that this wire
has been snipped not one hour ago...

24:26.970 --> 24:29.086
...as you can plainly see.

24:29.250 --> 24:30.763
What is your name?

24:33.890 --> 24:36.040
Your little jest escapes me.

24:36.210 --> 24:37.962
I am Monsieur Milo Perrier.

24:38.130 --> 24:40.724
He was injured
by a falling gargoyle...

24:40.890 --> 24:43.529
...while standing
in Chinese footprints.

24:43.690 --> 24:45.760
We rang, a woman screamed...

24:45.930 --> 24:48.000
...a mouse ran through the door.

24:48.170 --> 24:50.889
As you can plainly see,
I miss nothing.

24:51.050 --> 24:53.120
Since we can't call a doctor...

24:53.290 --> 24:57.602
...I will need a cold compress
and hot chocolate, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

24:57.770 --> 25:00.842
We don't have <i>n'est-ce pas,</i> sir.
Just Hershey's.

25:01.010 --> 25:03.649
I'll call the maid.

25:14.770 --> 25:17.921
I'll fetch it for you myself, sir.

25:18.090 --> 25:22.527
In the meantime, if you'll be
good enough to follow me to your room.

25:23.490 --> 25:25.208
Get up. Get up.

25:25.370 --> 25:28.248
There's something about him
I do not trust.

25:28.410 --> 25:31.243
Notice how his eyes
never look at you.

25:31.410 --> 25:33.241
He's blind, monsieur.

25:35.170 --> 25:37.445
Nonsense.

25:41.370 --> 25:43.088
There's the house now.

25:44.370 --> 25:47.203
- What's the matter?
- My feet are killing me.

25:47.370 --> 25:51.522
Why didn't you tell me we needed oil
before I went back for gas?

25:51.690 --> 25:53.965
I gave you $50
and the gas was $5.00.

25:54.130 --> 25:57.805
Maybe you'd come back. Maybe not.
I couldn't risk it.

25:57.970 --> 26:00.643
- Don't you trust me, Sam?
- Trust you?

26:00.810 --> 26:05.122
The last time that I trusted a dame
was in Paris in 1940.

26:05.290 --> 26:07.565
She said she was going to get wine.

26:07.730 --> 26:10.802
Two hours later,
the Germans marched into France.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.847
I'm sorry, Sam.

26:13.010 --> 26:15.604
Sorry nothing.
Give me my change.

26:21.610 --> 26:23.248
Dinner will be at 9:00.

26:23.410 --> 26:26.004
I'll have the maid
bring your chocolate.

26:26.170 --> 26:28.764
- One moment, my good man.
- Sir?

26:43.730 --> 26:46.688
Thank you. That will be all.

26:48.850 --> 26:53.162
He's blind, all right.
Those were my funniest faces.

27:03.210 --> 27:05.724
It's not exactly
the Copacabana, is it?

27:05.890 --> 27:10.327
I don't feel good about this.
Maybe tonight your luck runs out.

27:10.490 --> 27:14.085
Maybe so. There's a number
on the wall for all of us.

27:14.250 --> 27:17.959
If tonight's the night
they pick mine, so be it.

27:18.610 --> 27:20.441
After you, sweetheart.

27:22.130 --> 27:25.122
- First, kiss me, Sam.
- I don't kiss.

27:25.290 --> 27:26.803
Just this once, Sam.

27:26.970 --> 27:30.121
I don't like kissing.
Now leave me alone.

27:41.490 --> 27:43.287
My God!

27:43.450 --> 27:45.441
- He's dead!
- I beg your pardon?

27:45.610 --> 27:50.161
Sam Diamond is lying out there.
He's been crushed to death.

27:50.330 --> 27:53.163
I'm going to faint.
Catch me.

27:53.330 --> 27:56.845
Madam. Madam, where are you?

27:57.010 --> 27:59.444
Hold it right there.
Freeze, blinky!

27:59.610 --> 28:02.647
Get your hands up.
Turn your face to the wall.

28:07.170 --> 28:09.684
All right, angel.
You can get up now.

28:09.850 --> 28:11.408
Turn around, Jeeves.

28:14.170 --> 28:18.960
Your concrete Christmas present came
two seconds early, no thanks to you.

28:19.130 --> 28:22.008
I apologize for
any unfortunate mishap, sir.

28:22.170 --> 28:26.163
- May I put my hands down?
- Don't test your luck, Shakespeare.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.719
I got your invitation to dinner...

28:28.890 --> 28:33.088
...but I didn't realize
I'd be the main course.

28:34.210 --> 28:37.168
I had a kid brother
who got it the same way...

28:37.330 --> 28:40.242
...working on a case like this
two years ago.

28:40.410 --> 28:44.244
That boy would've been 63
on Tuesday.

28:44.410 --> 28:49.848
For two cents, I'd take this...
Get him away from me! Get him away.

28:50.010 --> 28:53.525
Get him away before I stuff him
like a tiger trophy...

28:53.690 --> 28:56.921
...his limey pals
like to hang up on saloon walls.

28:57.090 --> 28:58.887
Please.

29:00.330 --> 29:02.798
He has a dreadful temper,
hasn't he?

29:16.810 --> 29:19.608
9:00, time for dinner.

29:19.770 --> 29:22.284
Is everything ready?

29:24.690 --> 29:26.203
I don't smell anything.

29:26.370 --> 29:28.838
Very light on the seasoning,
are you?

29:29.010 --> 29:32.366
Put the soup in a tureen
and keep the squabs on low.

29:32.530 --> 29:34.725
I'll serve cocktails.

29:34.890 --> 29:39.759
When you hear the bell,
bring out the chilled asparagus...

29:39.930 --> 29:43.206
...and turn up the flame
on the squabs.

29:44.530 --> 29:47.169
Have you got that?

30:00.890 --> 30:02.960
You didn't tell me how I look.

30:03.130 --> 30:05.598
No different than always...
Ravishing.

30:06.450 --> 30:09.647
- Do you love and adore me?
- I love and adore you.

30:09.930 --> 30:14.720
- You have the best tush in high society.
- Years of horseback riding.

30:14.890 --> 30:17.085
Getting to bottom of things?

30:17.250 --> 30:19.684
- Ah, Wang. You remember...
- Of course.

30:19.850 --> 30:22.922
- Nice to see you, Ah Wang.
- Always a pleasure.

30:23.090 --> 30:26.162
What a beautiful gown.
Tell me where you got it.

30:26.330 --> 30:31.279
This? This an old dress.
Had it for years.

30:31.570 --> 30:34.130
Please to meet adopted son, Willie.

30:34.290 --> 30:38.203
East meets West
in a most bizarre setting.

30:38.370 --> 30:41.362
I didn't know you were invited.
You know Wang.

30:41.530 --> 30:44.328
I had the pleasure
of dining in Shanghai...

30:44.490 --> 30:47.084
...many years ago with Inspector Wang.

30:49.210 --> 30:51.280
You remember. Yes.

30:51.450 --> 30:56.001
You had "hong ching chu"
and I had "kow dung woo fong."

30:56.170 --> 30:58.684
My wife, Dora. Inspector Perrier.

31:01.650 --> 31:04.005
I'm sorry. Our room is so dusty.

31:04.170 --> 31:06.479
My fault.
I should have blown first.

31:06.650 --> 31:10.563
May I present my <i>secrétaire</i>
and chauffeur Marcel Cassette.

31:10.730 --> 31:15.929
- Recovered from your accident, Marcel?
- But how did you know?

31:16.090 --> 31:17.762
From the way you bend.

31:17.930 --> 31:20.603
Your right side
smashed in by a Citroen.

31:20.770 --> 31:23.159
I detected a slight
metallic sound...

31:23.330 --> 31:26.606
...so I think you have
an artificial hip. Steel?

31:26.770 --> 31:30.285
Aluminum. You're as quick as ever,
Charleston.

31:30.450 --> 31:32.042
And you, Charleston...

31:32.210 --> 31:35.839
...did not approve of
Mrs. Charleston dying hair blond?

31:36.010 --> 31:37.682
I beg your pardon?

31:37.850 --> 31:39.806
Mrs. Charleston hair red.

31:40.730 --> 31:44.245
You have blond hairs on shoulder.

31:44.410 --> 31:49.564
That means she has dyed red hair
to blond then back again to red.

31:49.730 --> 31:51.561
Or else you have been...

31:53.490 --> 31:58.439
So sorry. Wang is wrong.
Shall we go to dinner, please?

32:05.250 --> 32:09.004
- Boy, Pop, you sure put your...
- Shut Japanese mouth.

32:09.170 --> 32:12.162
It must be ghastly
to have a hip removed.

32:12.330 --> 32:15.083
- Does it hurt?
- Only in damp weather.

32:21.770 --> 32:26.560
- Are you all right?
- Pay no attention. You'll spoil him.

32:26.730 --> 32:28.209
Get up. Get up.

32:31.170 --> 32:34.765
- As I was saying, Mr. Charleston...
- Hey, Pop.

32:35.570 --> 32:38.721
A treacherous road
like fresh mushrooms...

32:38.890 --> 32:43.088
I know. Dog stick tongue
out of picture.

32:43.250 --> 32:45.969
Treacherous road
like fresh mushrooms.

32:50.370 --> 32:51.883
He's a charming fellow.

32:52.050 --> 32:55.087
African death mask.
Died in some tribal ritual.

32:55.250 --> 32:57.559
Wonder where others are.

32:57.730 --> 32:59.607
Others?

32:59.770 --> 33:01.362
What others?

33:01.530 --> 33:05.205
Invitation to dinner and murder
finally clear to Wang...

33:05.370 --> 33:07.930
...with appearance
of Monsieur Perrier.

33:08.090 --> 33:11.969
It's obvious that the world's
greatest detectives were invited.

33:12.130 --> 33:14.690
Five of us, darling.
Three are here.

33:14.850 --> 33:16.568
Two have not yet arrived.

33:16.730 --> 33:19.403
- Miss Jessie Marbles of England.
- And...

33:19.570 --> 33:22.164
Sam Diamond of San Francisco.

33:22.330 --> 33:23.809
I know who you all are.

33:23.970 --> 33:28.839
The lady in the dress is my secretary
and mistress, Tess Skeffington.

33:29.010 --> 33:32.047
- Sam, don't.
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.

33:32.210 --> 33:35.088
She doesn't like it
when I'm brutally honest.

33:35.250 --> 33:38.128
Then again, we're all
in a brutal business.

33:38.290 --> 33:42.522
Never considered murder
to be business, Mr. Diamond.

33:42.690 --> 33:44.726
Is that right, Mr. Wang?

33:44.890 --> 33:50.248
Maybe not for you, since you put your
money in vegetables in the late '30s.

33:50.410 --> 33:53.527
Our friends don't know
that you own 50 percent...

33:53.690 --> 33:57.603
...of the bean sprouts and the bamboo
shoots grown in China.

33:57.770 --> 34:00.648
You can imagine how much
chicken chow mein...

34:00.810 --> 34:02.960
...goes into his pot each year.

34:03.130 --> 34:05.485
- Do I have the figures right?
- Right.

34:05.650 --> 34:07.880
What does this have to do
with anything?

34:08.050 --> 34:10.438
Or you, Mr. Perrier.

34:10.610 --> 34:13.362
You work both sides
of the big drink.

34:13.530 --> 34:16.966
Pretty good pickings,
solving crimes for barons...

34:17.130 --> 34:19.849
...and putting your fees
into Swiss banks.

34:20.010 --> 34:23.081
Three trips a year buys
a lot of hot chocolate.

34:23.250 --> 34:24.524
See here, Diamond...

34:24.690 --> 34:29.844
You see here, Mr. Charleston of
New York, Palm Beach and Beverly Hills.

34:30.010 --> 34:32.319
Crime's a hobby to you, isn't it?

34:32.489 --> 34:37.245
It’s a game to wile away the time
while you wait for room service...

34:37.409 --> 34:41.562
...while your wife's dough buys
martinis and your $300 suits.

34:41.730 --> 34:44.244
That's nice, when all
you gotta do...

34:44.409 --> 34:48.722
...is give your wife a grab now
and then and take the dog for a leak.

34:48.889 --> 34:52.405
Sorry to shock you, but I never
went to finishing school.

34:52.570 --> 34:54.322
My school is the streets...

34:54.489 --> 34:57.482
...and the barrel of a revolver
is my teacher.

34:57.650 --> 35:01.882
I get $50 a day in expenses
when I can get them, gentlemen.

35:02.050 --> 35:05.884
I owe Miss Skeffington three years
back pay. Ain't that right?

35:06.050 --> 35:09.201
- I don't care about the money.
- Neither do I.

35:09.370 --> 35:12.919
If one of you would be
so kind as to give my friend...

35:13.090 --> 35:17.242
...a glass of cheap white wine,
I'm going down to find the can.

35:17.410 --> 35:20.208
I talk so much sometimes,
I forget to go.

35:22.810 --> 35:26.041
Please excuse Sam.
He was shot in the head last week.

35:26.210 --> 35:28.770
He shouldn't be
out of the hospital.

35:28.930 --> 35:32.002
- I think he's damned honest.
- Dickie, language.

35:32.170 --> 35:34.809
Miss Jessica Marbles and nurse.

35:43.450 --> 35:47.523
Miss Marbles.
So we finally meet.

35:47.690 --> 35:52.206
I've admired you ever since
I was tiny little detective.

35:52.370 --> 35:54.122
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

35:54.290 --> 35:56.599
I am Jessica Marbles.

35:56.770 --> 36:01.525
This is Miss Withers, my nurse.
She's been with me 52 years.

36:01.690 --> 36:04.363
I have to take care
of the poor dear now.

36:04.530 --> 36:09.126
Are you all right, Miss Withers?
Do you want your medicine now?

36:18.290 --> 36:22.203
She's off. I could use
a good, stiff shot, Mr. Charleston.

36:22.370 --> 36:25.726
I believe booze, as you call it,
is your department.

36:25.890 --> 36:29.087
- My pleasure, madam.
- Who's the old geezer?

36:31.170 --> 36:32.649
Jessie, baby!

36:34.770 --> 36:39.719
- You have a bullet hole in your back.
- You should see the other guy.

36:40.850 --> 36:42.488
Quiet, please.

36:42.650 --> 36:45.403
Observe strange sound.

36:49.770 --> 36:53.558
My God, it's the face.
It's coming from the face.

36:55.850 --> 36:58.648
He's going through
his final moments.

36:58.810 --> 37:04.043
- What could it mean?
- It means dinner, sir. We have no gong.

37:11.650 --> 37:14.642
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to make a toast.

37:14.810 --> 37:18.769
Our host, Mr. Lionel Twain,
is indeed a most unique man.

37:18.930 --> 37:21.160
One:
He's succeeded in gathering...

37:21.330 --> 37:23.764
...the world's greatest detectives...

37:23.930 --> 37:27.127
...to investigate a crime
not yet committed.

37:27.290 --> 37:29.087
Two: He's set traps for us:

37:29.250 --> 37:32.322
A bridge that almost collapses,
falling statues.

37:32.490 --> 37:34.128
Does he mean to kill us?

37:34.290 --> 37:37.043
Not yet. He could've done that
at any time.

37:37.210 --> 37:40.725
He's merely trying to whet
our appetites for the game.

37:40.890 --> 37:45.122
Three: Why five detectives
instead of one?

37:45.290 --> 37:48.282
Because he intends
to take us all on...

37:48.450 --> 37:51.760
...a feat that no criminal mind
has yet attempted.

37:51.930 --> 37:54.808
Before this hellish
weekend begins...

37:54.970 --> 37:57.359
...I propose that we toast...

37:57.530 --> 38:00.727
...to either a most beguiling
and charming man...

38:00.890 --> 38:04.360
...or to an insidious,
fiendish madman.

38:05.570 --> 38:07.561
- Bottoms up.
- One moment.

38:08.970 --> 38:11.723
Point four: Wine poisoned.

38:13.570 --> 38:18.086
An ancient, tasteless, colourless
and odourless Oriental herb...

38:18.250 --> 38:21.367
...that kills instantly.
Observe, please.

38:29.370 --> 38:32.362
Great Scott, Mr. Wang.
You saved our lives.

38:32.530 --> 38:35.124
Not quite, Mrs. Charleston.

38:35.290 --> 38:37.326
Bon appétit.

38:40.330 --> 38:44.687
Since Wang was the one who could
detect poison, only he was tested.

38:44.850 --> 38:46.329
Point five:

38:46.490 --> 38:50.403
Mr. Twain is both beguiling
and fiendish.

38:53.970 --> 38:57.201
- Get a doctor, quick.
- No, no. It's all right.

38:57.370 --> 39:01.727
My wine is not poisoned.
It was just a bad year.

39:01.890 --> 39:03.323
Good work, Mr. Wang.

39:03.490 --> 39:07.483
We must all be on our guard
through every course of the meal.

39:07.650 --> 39:09.800
You're all forgetting one thing.

39:10.930 --> 39:14.445
This makes the butler suspicious.
He poured the wine.

39:14.610 --> 39:18.842
How would he know which
one to serve the poisoned glass to?

39:19.010 --> 39:20.602
That's very simple.

39:20.770 --> 39:24.365
Blind people have
a very keen sense of smell.

39:24.530 --> 39:28.284
Since we're Anglo-Saxon
and Mr. Wang's son is Japanese...

39:28.450 --> 39:30.520
...it wouldn't be hard
to sniff out the Chinaman.

39:30.690 --> 39:33.204
See here.
That's a tacky thing to say.

39:33.370 --> 39:35.759
It's a tacky world,
Mr. Charleston.

39:35.930 --> 39:38.490
- Isn't that right, angel?
- That's right.

39:38.650 --> 39:41.687
Quiet, please.
Butler approaches.

39:41.850 --> 39:46.480
I apologize. I'm having
communication problems with the cook.

39:46.650 --> 39:48.208
Who poured the wine?

39:48.370 --> 39:50.247
Mr. Twain, sir.

39:50.410 --> 39:53.402
It was left for me
in the refrigerator.

39:53.570 --> 39:57.404
I was told to give Mr. Wang
the glass with the sticky stem.

39:57.570 --> 39:59.162
And you didn't ask why?

39:59.330 --> 40:02.003
I was lucky to find
the refrigerator.

40:02.170 --> 40:05.560
- If I may serve the soup now?
- By all means.

40:15.970 --> 40:17.961
Yes, I'm famished.

40:32.050 --> 40:34.325
One moment.

40:34.490 --> 40:37.129
- Where is the soup?
- In your dish, sir.

40:37.290 --> 40:40.327
There is nothing in my dish
but my dish.

40:40.490 --> 40:43.960
- I don't understand, sir.
- Here, take the spoon.

40:44.130 --> 40:45.961
Taste it for yourself.

40:54.250 --> 40:56.241
I see what you mean, sir.

40:56.410 --> 41:00.847
If you'll excuse me, I'd better
have a little talk with the cook.

41:02.250 --> 41:06.846
Murder by starvation.
Maybe that's his game.

41:07.010 --> 41:10.161
- What do you think?
- I don't know. Ask the moose.

41:10.330 --> 41:13.447
He's been watching
since we came in.

41:16.250 --> 41:20.482
Ten people for dinner,
and I'm serving them hot nothing!

41:20.650 --> 41:22.845
You can't get good help today.

41:28.890 --> 41:32.439
You're fired, you understand?
Fired!

41:32.610 --> 41:35.363
I want you out,
do you hear? Out!

41:40.610 --> 41:42.441
And stay out.

41:44.130 --> 41:46.246
Something just occurred to me.

41:46.410 --> 41:48.799
- The seating's all wrong.
- How so?

41:48.970 --> 41:51.484
- I'm sitting next to Dora.
- So what?

41:51.650 --> 41:53.481
- She's your wife.
- Exactly.

41:53.650 --> 41:56.801
The husband's never seated
next to the wife.

41:56.970 --> 42:00.326
I should be on the opposite side.
Will you trade?

42:00.490 --> 42:02.958
- Now, Mr. Charleston?
- Now, Mr. Wang.

42:06.050 --> 42:09.122
Another test that could
have cost us our lives.

42:09.290 --> 42:12.088
Saved only by the fact
that I am well-bred.

42:12.250 --> 42:15.720
Lucky it wasn't me.
I'd have been chopped liver.

42:19.770 --> 42:24.082
Silence, please. Do not panic.
No person move from place.

42:24.250 --> 42:26.639
Someone just came in.
I hear footsteps.

42:26.810 --> 42:29.244
Wait! Quiet, everyone!

42:29.410 --> 42:31.844
- I smell something.
- What is it?

42:32.010 --> 42:34.808
Good God! Franks and beans!

42:34.970 --> 42:37.530
I'm afraid that's all we have,
sir.

42:37.690 --> 42:40.250
You know how I get
when you touch me there.

42:40.410 --> 42:42.321
My hands are in my pockets.

42:42.490 --> 42:44.879
- They're my pockets.
- Sorry.

42:45.050 --> 42:46.881
Dickie, behave yourself.

42:49.850 --> 42:52.080
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

42:52.250 --> 42:54.445
I'm your host, Lionel Twain.

43:09.090 --> 43:11.240
Good God, what an entrance!

43:11.410 --> 43:16.245
A bit theatrical, Miss Marbles,
but I do so love illusion.

43:16.410 --> 43:19.049
Please forgive my hat.
I'm losing my hair.

43:19.210 --> 43:22.361
I thought Twain was
an older man, say 72, 73.

43:22.530 --> 43:26.079
Seventy-six to be exact,
Mr. Diamond.

43:26.250 --> 43:29.526
How do I look so young?
Quite simple.

43:29.690 --> 43:33.319
A complete vegetable diet,
12 hours' sleep a night...

43:33.490 --> 43:36.288
...and lots and lots of makeup.

43:36.450 --> 43:40.238
- I trust you're all comfortable.
- Comfortable, Mr. Twain?

43:40.410 --> 43:44.164
Is that what you call poisoned wine
and near decapitation?

43:44.330 --> 43:47.367
No. I call it inspiration.

43:47.530 --> 43:52.240
You haven't explained the mechanical
and culinary attempts on our lives.

43:52.410 --> 43:55.004
Merely games, Monsieur Perrier.

43:55.170 --> 43:58.162
Pitting wits with you,
so to speak.

43:58.330 --> 44:02.118
Pit your wits with me
and you won't have wits to pit with.

44:02.290 --> 44:04.281
You're spitting on the nurse.

44:04.450 --> 44:08.079
Sorry, old lady.
Crazy broad should be in bed.

44:08.250 --> 44:10.400
We have been here four hours...

44:10.570 --> 44:13.801
...and there hasn't been
a hot dinner or a corpse.

44:13.970 --> 44:17.679
- I must therefore bid you adieu.
- I bid one adieu as well.

44:17.850 --> 44:20.364
No one is leaving this house.

44:31.650 --> 44:33.925
What meaning of this, Mr. Twain?

44:34.090 --> 44:37.162
I will tell you, Mr. Wang,
if you can tell me...

44:37.330 --> 44:40.561
...why one of the most brilliant
minds of the century...

44:40.730 --> 44:42.960
...can't say prepositions
or articles.

44:43.130 --> 44:46.122
"The," Mr. Wang.
"What is the meaning of this?"

44:46.290 --> 44:49.726
That what I said.
What meaning of this?

44:49.890 --> 44:51.642
The meaning of this is...

44:51.810 --> 44:55.280
...that I have decided to prove,
beyond any doubt...

44:55.450 --> 45:00.365
...that the greatest criminologist in
the world is sitting at this table...

45:00.530 --> 45:03.044
...and you are all looking at him.

45:03.210 --> 45:05.360
No, don't look at each other!

45:05.530 --> 45:09.045
Look at me! I'm the greatest!
I'm number one!

45:09.210 --> 45:12.566
To me you look like number two.
Know what I mean?

45:12.730 --> 45:16.962
- What does he mean?
- I'll tell you later. It's disgusting.

45:17.130 --> 45:20.406
In all your adventures,
monsieurs and madames...

45:20.570 --> 45:23.642
...none of you has ever had
an unsolved murder.

45:23.810 --> 45:27.689
Your reputations exist
on this single fact.

45:27.850 --> 45:33.288
But what would the world say
if the five greatest detectives...

45:33.450 --> 45:38.729
...found themselves trapped
in a house, shut off from the world...

45:38.890 --> 45:42.007
...only to discover
a dead body...

45:42.170 --> 45:45.480
...stabbed 12 times in the back
with a knife...

45:45.650 --> 45:50.963
...and not one of you able
to solve the crime?

45:51.130 --> 45:53.485
- You mean murder?
- We're talking shop.

45:53.650 --> 45:55.720
Yes, murder, Mrs. Charleston!

45:55.890 --> 45:57.767
On the stroke of midnight...

45:57.930 --> 46:01.047
...someone in this house
will be murdered.

46:01.210 --> 46:04.805
Left out one small detail,
Mr. Twain.

46:05.810 --> 46:07.880
Who victim?

46:08.050 --> 46:10.439
"Is the." "Is the."

46:10.610 --> 46:13.886
"Who is the victim?"
That drives me crazy!

46:14.050 --> 46:17.360
- Sounds like a short ride to me.
- Does it?

46:17.530 --> 46:22.445
Well, we shall see who is sane
and who is crazy around here.

46:23.970 --> 46:25.369
Mr. Wang...

46:25.530 --> 46:29.284
...the victim is here at this table
at this very moment...

46:29.450 --> 46:33.762
...and so too, ladies and gentlemen,
is the murderer.

46:33.930 --> 46:37.047
- Murder-poo?
- Yes, dear.

46:37.210 --> 46:40.805
We're going to have
a lovely murder-poo.

46:40.970 --> 46:44.565
Push her wheelchair down the driveway.
We got business.

46:44.730 --> 46:47.528
- You know who's gonna get it?
- Intimately.

46:47.690 --> 46:50.284
- And how it'll be committed?
- Definitely.

46:50.450 --> 46:52.600
And what time
murder take place?

46:52.770 --> 46:55.125
"The" murder. Precisely.

46:55.290 --> 46:59.602
It's not my business, but doesn't
that mean you're the murderer?

46:59.770 --> 47:03.046
No wives. I refuse to
discuss this with wives.

47:03.210 --> 47:06.805
All fingers do point to you.
Not much of a challenge.

47:06.970 --> 47:09.643
Shall I make it more interesting?

47:09.810 --> 47:13.200
One million dollars
to the one who solves the crime.

47:13.370 --> 47:15.930
Wagered against your reputations.

47:16.090 --> 47:18.081
One million dollars, tax-free.

47:18.250 --> 47:21.799
In addition, the paperback rights
and the film sale.

47:21.970 --> 47:23.483
It's 11:00, amigos...

47:23.650 --> 47:27.563
...just one hour before death
strikes someone in this room.

47:27.730 --> 47:30.369
See you at midnight.

47:33.570 --> 47:35.401
See here, Mr. Twain!

47:36.610 --> 47:40.569
- He's gone!
- No, he's not. He's down there.

47:40.730 --> 47:42.686
Fast little bunny, ain't you?

47:42.850 --> 47:45.205
I've never moved, Mr. Diamond.

47:45.370 --> 47:48.362
I'm still down there.
A stunt with mirrors.

47:48.530 --> 47:52.318
Is that so?
Willing to risk seven years' bad luck?

47:52.490 --> 47:54.162
Try it, Mr. Diamond.

47:54.330 --> 47:56.400
It's your funeral, butterball.

47:57.450 --> 48:00.601
Wait. Sometimes it doesn't work.

48:02.850 --> 48:05.762
You've won this round,
Mr. Diamond.

48:05.930 --> 48:08.285
My turn comes at midnight.

48:16.290 --> 48:18.850
I hope he knows
how to stop that thing.

48:20.050 --> 48:24.566
Anybody offering a million bucks to
solve a crime that ain't happened...

48:24.730 --> 48:27.005
...has lost more upstairs than hair.

48:27.170 --> 48:30.082
What do we do?
Sit and wait to be butchered?

48:30.250 --> 48:32.002
And what has happened
to the butler?

48:32.170 --> 48:35.640
Why has he not returned?
With our dinner?

48:35.810 --> 48:37.960
- Go look for him.
- No!

48:38.130 --> 48:40.564
- No one to leave this room.
- Why not?

48:40.730 --> 48:42.880
Twain say victim at this table.

48:43.050 --> 48:47.282
If we stay together, crime
cannot be committed without witnesses.

48:47.450 --> 48:50.283
He's right.
You're one smart Chinaman.

48:50.450 --> 48:56.207
Let's join hands. The chain's stronger
if the links are unbroken. Join hands.

49:07.850 --> 49:09.363
Stop that.

49:12.650 --> 49:15.289
- Stop it, I said.
- What is it, Diamond?

49:15.850 --> 49:19.047
She's giving my palm the finger,
the dirty broad.

49:19.210 --> 49:22.168
Naughty, naughty, Miss Withers.

49:26.530 --> 49:28.168
- Good God!
- What?

49:28.330 --> 49:30.161
Look!

49:33.970 --> 49:36.325
- What's she doing?
- She's screaming.

49:36.490 --> 49:39.323
- What's happened?
- Something wrong in kitchen.

49:39.490 --> 49:41.526
- With our dinner!
- Patience.

49:41.690 --> 49:44.250
- Is someone there?
- Someone with dinner?

49:44.410 --> 49:47.163
Cook cannot speak or hear.

49:48.650 --> 49:51.244
"I think butler is dead.

49:51.410 --> 49:54.527
My name is Yetta.
I don't work Thursdays."

49:54.690 --> 49:56.487
Ask her if she sleeps in.

49:56.650 --> 49:58.800
We'll investigate.
Someone must go.

49:58.970 --> 50:01.962
Not alone. Mr. Charleston,
Mr. Diamond, stay.

50:02.130 --> 50:06.203
Miss Marble, Mr. Perrier and Wang,
we'll investigate.

50:10.130 --> 50:13.008
That's right,
just let it all out.

50:14.050 --> 50:16.689
Here. Oh, dear.

50:18.210 --> 50:21.122
Careful, Wang!
Fingerprints.

50:21.290 --> 50:24.088
- Where?
- Yours.

50:24.250 --> 50:26.366
Here, take my handkerchief.

50:39.370 --> 50:41.167
- Is he?
- He look like...

50:41.330 --> 50:43.605
Seems like.

50:43.770 --> 50:46.284
Touch nothing!
Fingerprints.

50:46.450 --> 50:48.202
Quite so.

50:48.370 --> 50:50.167
Pencil.

51:04.050 --> 51:05.927
No pulse.

51:06.850 --> 51:09.045
No heartbeat.

51:09.210 --> 51:13.408
If condition does not change,
this man is dead.

51:13.570 --> 51:15.765
No signs of foul play.

51:15.930 --> 51:17.045
Hold on!

51:17.210 --> 51:19.041
What's this?

51:20.450 --> 51:22.759
What do you make of this, Perrier?

51:23.770 --> 51:25.249
Poison, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

51:25.410 --> 51:28.083
Not <i>n'est-ce pas.</i> Cocoa.

51:28.250 --> 51:30.480
So at last we have our murder.

51:30.650 --> 51:34.484
Not quite. Twain say murder victim
sitting at our table.

51:34.650 --> 51:36.447
Butler not at our table.

51:36.610 --> 51:41.286
Butler only killed to divert us
from real murder still to come.

51:42.330 --> 51:43.479
Look!

51:43.650 --> 51:47.609
One of the knives is missing.
The butcher's knife, I'll wager.

51:47.770 --> 51:50.807
- The others are in danger.
- What's exact time?

51:52.450 --> 51:54.281
11:31 and 56 seconds.

51:54.850 --> 51:57.364
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight...

51:57.530 --> 52:00.044
Tell me when to stop. 59, 60...

52:00.210 --> 52:03.680
28 minutes to main murder.
Back to dining room.

52:03.850 --> 52:06.444
Must all be together at midnight.

52:07.730 --> 52:09.243
One moment!

52:13.810 --> 52:15.482
Handkerchief.

52:26.770 --> 52:29.045
- What is it?
- A bill.

52:29.210 --> 52:33.726
Everything here has been rented:
The butler, the food, the chairs.

52:33.890 --> 52:35.767
- You mean?
- Yes.

52:35.930 --> 52:39.320
This entire murder
has been catered.

52:42.650 --> 52:44.959
It's Twain's doing.
The man is mad.

52:45.130 --> 52:48.406
Mad, yes, but no fool.
I only hope we are in time.

52:48.570 --> 52:49.570
Door locked.

52:49.730 --> 52:52.483
Diamond probably locked
it from the inside.

52:52.650 --> 52:55.118
Good thinking on Diamond head.

52:55.290 --> 52:58.441
Diamond, it's Perrier.
It's all right. Open up.

52:59.890 --> 53:02.358
Diamond? Charleston?
Are you in there?

53:02.530 --> 53:07.285
Go back to kitchen, get dining
room key from pocket of dead butler.

53:07.450 --> 53:12.205
Don't say "dead butler." It's bad
enough I have to reach in his pocket.

53:23.930 --> 53:25.807
Holy <i>merde.</i>

53:32.130 --> 53:33.927
Miss Skeffington!

53:34.090 --> 53:36.081
Miss Skeffington!
Miss Withers!

53:36.250 --> 53:37.444
- He's gone.
- Who?

53:37.610 --> 53:40.443
The butler's body is missing.
Here's the key.

53:40.610 --> 53:42.885
- Where you find key?
- In his pocket.

53:43.050 --> 53:44.722
- What pocket?
- The butler's.

53:44.890 --> 53:47.529
- Butler gone, but pocket there?
- Exactly.

53:47.690 --> 53:50.045
Someone stole him
but left his clothes.

53:50.210 --> 53:53.327
Open the door.
Something is very wrong here.

53:58.690 --> 54:01.682
Hello. Where is everyone?

54:01.850 --> 54:04.569
Room filled with empty people.

54:04.730 --> 54:06.721
I'll try the other door.

54:08.450 --> 54:10.406
It's locked from the inside.

54:10.570 --> 54:13.528
Both doors locked
from inside, yet no way out.

54:13.690 --> 54:15.442
I don't like it one bit.

54:15.610 --> 54:17.646
I like it,
but don't understand.

54:18.770 --> 54:22.399
Maybe other way out of room,
secret passageway perhaps.

54:23.810 --> 54:27.689
Wrong. There are no
secret passageways, Mr. Wang.

54:27.850 --> 54:29.920
- You spoke?
- Not me.

54:30.090 --> 54:31.887
I spoke.

54:33.650 --> 54:36.448
There! Voice come from cow
on wall!

54:36.610 --> 54:39.329
Moose! Moose, you imbecile!

54:39.490 --> 54:42.926
What have you done
with the others, you short madman?

54:43.930 --> 54:47.366
Stumped already.
Need some clues, Mr. Perrier?

54:47.530 --> 54:51.921
I need no clues from you. I find my
own, you demented lollipop!

54:52.090 --> 54:55.366
Man who argue with cow
is like train without wheels.

54:55.530 --> 54:58.203
- Soon get nowhere.
- I'm sick of fortunes!

54:58.370 --> 55:02.204
- Man who's sick of fortune...
- I said I was sick of this!

55:02.370 --> 55:05.203
- Quiet, gentlemen, please!
- Cow talk again.

55:05.370 --> 55:07.759
In need of a hint, Miss Marbles?

55:07.930 --> 55:12.560
You all mistake what you assume
They never left the dining room

55:12.730 --> 55:16.848
Count the numbers one to 10
Turn the knob and try again

55:18.130 --> 55:21.486
What does that mean,
they never left the room?!

55:21.650 --> 55:24.403
- They did.
- Do not mistake what you assume.

55:24.570 --> 55:26.481
- Back out in hall.
- What for?

55:26.650 --> 55:30.962
We assume others not here,
but cow say they are in dining room.

55:31.130 --> 55:32.927
Let us look once more.

55:35.570 --> 55:37.765
Please close door, Mr. Perrier.

55:39.650 --> 55:41.925
- I can't see what good...
- Quiet.

55:42.090 --> 55:43.921
Seven, eight, nine, 10.

55:45.050 --> 55:48.201
Miss Marbles, be so kind
as to open door.

55:54.290 --> 55:56.406
Where were you?
We was worried.

55:56.570 --> 55:58.447
Where were you?

55:58.610 --> 56:00.919
Here. Didn't you say not to leave?

56:01.090 --> 56:04.639
- You have not left this room since?
- Certainly not.

56:04.810 --> 56:06.607
Answer simple...

56:06.770 --> 56:09.284
...but question very hard.

56:09.450 --> 56:12.601
- Where's the butler?
- Completely murdered.

56:12.770 --> 56:16.080
Poisoned. One of
the butcher's knives is missing.

56:16.250 --> 56:19.162
We came back here,
but the doors were locked.

56:19.330 --> 56:23.448
I went to get the key from the butler.
His body was gone.

56:23.610 --> 56:26.363
He'd been stripped
and his clothes left.

56:26.530 --> 56:31.126
I don't understand. Why would anyone
want to steal a dead, naked body?

56:31.290 --> 56:33.565
Well, dear,
there are people who...

56:35.490 --> 56:38.800
That's tacky. That's really tacky.

56:38.970 --> 56:40.926
Then we returned here...

56:41.090 --> 56:43.888
...opened the door,
but the room was empty.

56:44.050 --> 56:46.644
You were all gone.

56:46.810 --> 56:51.520
The moose had told us not to assume
that you'd left the dining room.

56:51.690 --> 56:55.444
So we counted to 10
and tried it again.

56:56.490 --> 56:58.367
And here you were.

56:58.530 --> 57:02.682
I'm not one to use hyperbole,
but I'll tell you this.

57:02.850 --> 57:08.004
For the first time in my life,
I had the ca-ca scared out of me.

57:08.170 --> 57:11.287
I like her.
I really like her.

57:12.530 --> 57:15.124
- Gunshots, monsieur.
- Gunshots, Pop.

57:15.290 --> 57:17.167
Gunshots, Dickie.

57:18.210 --> 57:24.319
This time Charleston and I will go.
Everybody else stay here. Let's go.

57:28.970 --> 57:31.484
What do you make
of all of this, Wang?

57:34.530 --> 57:36.361
Is confusing.

57:36.530 --> 57:40.808
"It"! "It" is confusing!
Say your goddamn pronouns!

57:46.810 --> 57:48.448
Open the door.

57:49.530 --> 57:51.327
- Good God!
- What is it?

57:51.490 --> 57:52.684
He's back.

57:55.890 --> 57:58.006
And au naturel.

57:58.170 --> 58:02.641
I don't get it. First they steal
the body and leave the clothes.

58:02.810 --> 58:06.166
Then they steal the clothes
and bring the body back.

58:06.330 --> 58:09.925
- Who would do that?
- Possibly a deranged dry cleaner.

58:10.090 --> 58:11.921
What about the gunshots?

58:12.090 --> 58:14.809
Why shoot him
when he's been poisoned?

58:14.970 --> 58:19.600
We heard shots, but I don't see bullet
holes. Not on his head or chest.

58:19.770 --> 58:22.967
- Look all over him.
- All over his body?

58:23.130 --> 58:25.360
Somebody has to.
I'm standing guard.

58:25.530 --> 58:27.282
I'll stand guard. You look.

58:27.450 --> 58:29.202
We'll take turns.

58:29.370 --> 58:33.921
You look over the first dead
naked body, I'll look over the second.

58:35.890 --> 58:38.688
Hurry up.
We only got eight minutes.

58:45.650 --> 58:46.799
See anything?

58:46.970 --> 58:50.121
No, I don't see
a bullet hole anywhere.

58:50.290 --> 58:53.282
- Hold it. I see something.
- What is it?

58:53.450 --> 58:55.759
Forget it.
Not a bullet hole.

58:55.930 --> 58:58.649
If he wasn't plugged,
what about the shots?

58:58.810 --> 59:00.880
- Divide and conquer.
- What?

59:01.050 --> 59:02.199
Another diversion.

59:02.370 --> 59:05.999
He gives us meaningless clues,
dangles red herrings...

59:06.170 --> 59:08.400
...bedazzles us with banalities...

59:08.570 --> 59:12.358
...while seconds tick away
towards the terrible murder.

59:12.530 --> 59:16.409
You're good. Not my kind of cop,
but smart, and you smell good.

59:16.570 --> 59:19.528
You're not a pansy,
but what the hell are you?

59:19.690 --> 59:21.089
Classy, I suppose.

59:21.250 --> 59:24.287
- Dames fall for a guy like you.
- I don't see...

59:24.450 --> 59:26.406
Ever make it with a waitress?

59:26.570 --> 59:29.482
A waitress.
Big, fat waitress.

59:29.650 --> 59:32.039
I don't know about society dames...

59:32.210 --> 59:36.203
...but you ain't had it till you
made it with a big waitress.

59:36.370 --> 59:39.567
If you're ever interested,
you give me a call.

59:44.690 --> 59:46.009
Bizarre little twit.

59:46.170 --> 59:49.082
I'm still not sure about this guy.

59:56.050 --> 59:58.359
- What are you doing?
- I have to wash...

59:58.530 --> 01:00:00.282
I'll be out in a minute.

01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:02.759
I'll go ahead.
I'll tell the others.

01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:06.842
You're never gonna
believe this, folks.

01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:08.762
All right, where are you?

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:12.047
What the hell is going on here?

01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:14.770
Wash up later.
We got problems.

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:22.521
Locked from the inside.

01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:27.443
That can only mean one thing...

01:00:27.610 --> 01:00:29.805
...and I don't know what it is.

01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:37.805
You're never gonna believe...

01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:48.522
I'll be out in a minute.

01:00:56.770 --> 01:00:59.238
I don't remember
closing that door.

01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:07.241
What happened?

01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:10.760
What were the gunshots?

01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:16.079
Did anybody leave
since we were gone?

01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:19.242
- It happened to you too.
- Where's my Dickie?

01:01:20.370 --> 01:01:22.167
Sorry. Where's my husband?

01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:25.527
Two minutes to midnight,
if anyone is interested.

01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:27.726
It ain't possible, I say.

01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:32.327
Eight people in a dining room
can't turn into an empty room unless...

01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:35.562
- Unless what, Sam?
- Unless it never happened.

01:01:35.730 --> 01:01:37.482
I see your point, Diamond.

01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:40.881
When is a room with people
not a room with people?

01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:43.689
- When it is two dining rooms.
- Exactly!

01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:45.203
Two dining rooms?

01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:49.204
Two dining rooms, two everything.
Twain electronic genius.

01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:51.804
He's devised
a way to move the room...

01:01:51.970 --> 01:01:54.484
...silently, in the flash of an eye...

01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:57.369
...to be replaced by
an exact duplicate.

01:01:57.530 --> 01:01:59.760
- I knew it all the time.
- Please.

01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:02.490
I'll demonstrate.
I'll walk out the door...

01:02:02.650 --> 01:02:07.519
...close it, knock three times, enter,
and you will all be gone. Observe.

01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:16.880
I have it figured out.
There are two of everything.

01:02:17.050 --> 01:02:19.120
Dickie, that's old news.

01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:21.281
Everybody take their seats.

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:24.920
- I'm scared, Sam. Hold me.
- Hold yourself. I'm busy.

01:02:25.090 --> 01:02:27.240
Take the same seats
from before.

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:30.720
Forty seconds!
I'm very worried about Mr. Perrier.

01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:32.118
I'll look for him.

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:34.758
No. Sit, please.
No one to leave room.

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:38.087
The other door.

01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:43.566
It's locked. I can't open it.

01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:45.925
Hurry, man!
We have 15 seconds!

01:02:46.090 --> 01:02:48.160
Move your hand, chauffeur.

01:02:52.410 --> 01:02:53.525
Don't ask.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:58.321
- Why are you wearing the butler's outfit?
- I said don't ask! I don't know.

01:02:58.490 --> 01:03:00.526
It all happened too quickly.

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:05.039
The cook.
Where's the cook?

01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:07.087
- She's gone.
- Never spoke.

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:11.084
Ten more seconds.
Quickly, sit and join hands.

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:16.480
Impossible for murder
to happen without witnesses.

01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:20.520
Three... two... one!

01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:50.410
It's over.

01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:52.845
We're safe and sound.

01:03:56.610 --> 01:03:59.044
That's probably the cook.
Come in.

01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:00.689
The poor woman's deaf.

01:04:00.850 --> 01:04:03.648
I'm sorry. I forgot.
Come in!

01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:07.289
Not sound like cook to me.

01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:24.040
Mr. Twain.

01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:26.519
You appear to be wrong.

01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:29.966
Nobody here murdered.
Please to come in.

01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:37.050
Is he dead?

01:04:37.210 --> 01:04:40.202
With that in him,
in the long run he's better off.

01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:42.201
- Touch nothing!
- Stop that.

01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:44.486
We're experienced
criminologists.

01:04:44.650 --> 01:04:48.438
I find it insulting and redundant
to say "touch nothing."

01:04:48.610 --> 01:04:50.805
- Quiet, woman.
- Up yours, fella.

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:55.361
Most amusing. Bickering detectives
like making giant lamb stew:

01:04:55.530 --> 01:04:58.442
- Everything go to pot.
- Be quiet!

01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:03.719
Shut up, all of youse!
Nobody move!

01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:06.040
- Stay where you are!
- What is it?

01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:10.123
I have to go to the can again.
I don't wanna miss nothing.

01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:12.087
I'm going too, Sam.

01:05:13.930 --> 01:05:17.889
I'd rather do this alone, Tess.
Thanks anyway.

01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:22.401
The cook.

01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:24.083
What, darling?

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:26.559
It's obvious.
The cook murdered him.

01:05:26.730 --> 01:05:29.767
The butler's dead.
All of us were in this room.

01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:33.240
No one could get in.
That leaves the cook. Right?

01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:34.559
Wrong.

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:37.119
What makes you certain of this?

01:05:37.290 --> 01:05:41.522
To drive a knife that far up a man's
back, you need a strong arm.

01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:44.409
And this arm don't look
that strong to me.

01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:48.802
- Is that her arm?
- It ain't the pussycat's tail.

01:05:48.970 --> 01:05:51.530
Don't be alarmed, miss.
It ain't real.

01:05:51.690 --> 01:05:54.648
For that matter,
neither is the cook.

01:05:55.810 --> 01:05:59.041
I found this
before I got to the can.

01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:03.568
Got a little surprise
for you folks.

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:09.122
- Look!
- A mannequin!

01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:13.082
A dummy,
perfect in every detail...

01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:17.004
...with the exception of not being
able to make her speak.

01:06:17.170 --> 01:06:20.162
Hats off to the man
with the shiv in his back.

01:06:20.330 --> 01:06:22.480
Except that he's dead,
he's no dope.

01:06:22.650 --> 01:06:23.969
Nice going, Sam.

01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:28.089
I hope you realize that
someone in this room is a murderer.

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:30.161
For sake of ladies present...

01:06:30.330 --> 01:06:32.890
...may we return to drawing room?

01:06:33.050 --> 01:06:35.200
My son will cover up Mr. Twain.

01:06:35.370 --> 01:06:38.806
- Why do I do the work?
- Your mother not here to do it.

01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:40.528
Come, please.

01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:56.683
Excuse me.

01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:08.040
I'm getting a headache. Isn't there
a way to turn off that machine?

01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:11.361
Maybe some gadget
outside the window.

01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:18.041
It's raining this time.

01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:20.849
Let's get to business
and sort the facts.

01:07:21.010 --> 01:07:23.285
It is now 12:30 Sunday morning.

01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:26.044
The doors and windows
will open at dawn.

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:28.849
One of us will be
a million dollars richer...

01:07:29.010 --> 01:07:31.968
...and one will go
to the gas chamber to hang.

01:07:32.130 --> 01:07:36.408
One, Monsieur Perrier? Why not two?
We all have associates.

01:07:36.570 --> 01:07:39.767
Why not six or eight?
I don't trust any of youse.

01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:44.446
Maybe I'm a patsy set up for a fall,
but I'm not falling for youse.

01:07:44.610 --> 01:07:45.679
Not even me?

01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:50.002
Why don't you fall in love with
the Jap kid and get off my back?

01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:52.445
Can we get back to case, please?

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:55.807
Time is late and my eyes
are getting tired.

01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:59.167
- Thought they always looked like that.
- Knock it off!

01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:03.448
Sorry. This case is getting
on my nerves. I'm sorry, slanty.

01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:06.807
Thank you. Now then, facts,
please, facts.

01:08:06.970 --> 01:08:11.760
Mr. Twain predicts murder. Predicts
victim to be at table, correct?

01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:13.329
Correct.

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:15.606
This is official.
Correct.

01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:20.241
Predicts murder to take place at
midnight and number of stab wounds.

01:08:20.410 --> 01:08:23.765
How, if he not in collaboration
with murderer?

01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:27.206
- What if Twain did it himself?
- Murdered himself?

01:08:27.370 --> 01:08:30.645
For what possible reason?
And how?

01:08:30.810 --> 01:08:33.243
The motive is simple: Ego.

01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:37.642
If we weren't to solve this,
he'd be the world's best detective.

01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:42.167
With an ego like his, that he died
for it is a small price to pay.

01:08:42.330 --> 01:08:46.243
Any man who can create
this chamber of electronic marvels...

01:08:46.410 --> 01:08:51.006
...would be able to devise a machine
to stab him in the back 12 times.

01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:53.559
That was wonderful.
I'm so proud.

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:56.243
- Let's go to bed, quickly.
- One moment.

01:08:56.410 --> 01:08:59.004
Very interesting theory...

01:08:59.170 --> 01:09:02.640
...but you overlook
one very important point.

01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:05.198
- And that is?
- It's stupid.

01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:08.725
It's most stupid theory
I ever heard!

01:09:08.890 --> 01:09:12.359
- Do you have a better one?
- Yeah, much better one.

01:09:12.529 --> 01:09:15.442
You see, I have been
doing my homework.

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:17.919
For example,
I have information...

01:09:18.090 --> 01:09:20.888
...that your wife's
portfolio of stocks...

01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:24.167
...was seriously depleted
in financial crisis.

01:09:24.330 --> 01:09:29.085
In short, you are flat broke.
You've been borrowing for two years...

01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:32.002
...at 17% interest
from Mr. Lionel Twain.

01:09:32.170 --> 01:09:33.808
Broke? Is this true?

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:36.723
I was saving it for your birthday.

01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:39.165
One million dollars would buy...

01:09:39.330 --> 01:09:42.481
...great many tight suits,
would it not?

01:09:42.649 --> 01:09:44.880
- See here, Wang...
- Dead broke?

01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:48.167
Almost, darling.
I have $1.17 and some stamps.

01:09:48.330 --> 01:09:51.527
But I didn't murder Twain.
You do believe that?

01:09:51.689 --> 01:09:56.047
- We'll talk. We'll see.
- It could have been any one of you.

01:09:56.210 --> 01:09:59.407
Each one of us was out
of that room at one time...

01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:02.642
...giving ample opportunity
to commit the crime.

01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:06.166
As for motives,
there's more than ego and cash.

01:10:06.330 --> 01:10:07.922
For example, revenge.

01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:10.001
Meaning what, Mr. Charleston?

01:10:10.170 --> 01:10:14.243
I'm not the only one who's had
a past experience with Twain.

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:17.208
He was quite a ladies' man in his day.

01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:19.440
Are you suggesting
someone here...

01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:21.919
Was once in love
with Lionel Twain.

01:10:22.090 --> 01:10:24.399
He was engaged to and jilted...

01:10:24.570 --> 01:10:26.606
...Miss Jessica Marbles.

01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:31.926
Jesus H. Christ!

01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:34.320
Jilted 54 years ago at the altar.

01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:37.163
Left her there
in that same tweed outfit.

01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:40.889
- Is this true, Jessie?
- I was not jilted.

01:10:41.050 --> 01:10:42.483
I walked out on him.

01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:45.528
He wanted to fool around
before the wedding.

01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:48.568
And being the lady you are,
you refused.

01:10:48.730 --> 01:10:54.009
Not completely. But it got out of hand.
He was horrid, but I didn't kill him.

01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:57.003
That's good enough for me.
What about you?

01:10:57.170 --> 01:11:00.367
I'm not a Frenchy!
I'm a Belgy!

01:11:01.330 --> 01:11:05.039
And as for other motives,
how about patricide?

01:11:05.210 --> 01:11:07.770
The killing of one's own parent?

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:12.242
You mean that Lionel Twain was
the father of someone in this room?

01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:13.763
He wasn't my father.

01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:18.005
He was my uncle.

01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:20.082
He was very good to me.

01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:23.447
He would take me to the circus
and give me candy.

01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:27.569
We stopped going
when I was about 26.

01:11:29.530 --> 01:11:30.849
I'm sorry, Sam.

01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:33.843
Twenty-six?
What kind of a circus was it?

01:11:34.010 --> 01:11:38.128
Forgive me, but I was talking about
patricide, not uncle-cide.

01:11:38.290 --> 01:11:40.724
Twain may have been your uncle...

01:11:40.890 --> 01:11:43.768
...but he was the
illegitimate father of...

01:11:43.930 --> 01:11:46.398
...Monsieur Sidney Wang!

01:11:48.490 --> 01:11:50.401
It not true.

01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:53.607
I was adopted.
I have my papers.

01:11:53.770 --> 01:11:56.967
That is why I have adopted
all my children.

01:11:57.130 --> 01:11:58.802
I was wondering.

01:12:00.090 --> 01:12:02.206
He loved me very much...

01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:04.884
...but he was not very observant.

01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:09.999
One day when I was 19,
he called me to his study...

01:12:10.170 --> 01:12:14.163
...noticed for first time I was
Oriental, and kicked me out.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.560
- I could have...
- Killed him, Wang?

01:12:16.730 --> 01:12:19.039
As easily as you,
Monsieur Perrier.

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:22.805
Lionel Twain killed
the only thing you ever loved:

01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:26.246
Marie-Louise Cartier.

01:12:38.290 --> 01:12:40.565
Your sweetheart?

01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:44.801
My poodle.

01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:49.041
He was a most cruel man.

01:12:49.210 --> 01:12:53.203
Monsieur would come to France
every season...

01:12:54.450 --> 01:12:56.406
...to hunt poodles.

01:12:57.450 --> 01:12:59.042
The day they brought...

01:12:59.210 --> 01:13:02.407
...her bloodied collar to me,
I vowed I would...

01:13:02.570 --> 01:13:06.609
- Knock him off?
- Yes, gladly, if I had the chance.

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:08.688
But I did not.

01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:10.806
Someone here beat me to it.

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:14.485
There's more than one reason
that we was invited here.

01:13:14.650 --> 01:13:18.006
Not only was Twain testing
us as detectives...

01:13:18.170 --> 01:13:21.003
...but we all have motives
for doing him in.

01:13:21.170 --> 01:13:24.128
Have not yet heard
your motive, Mr. Diamond.

01:13:24.290 --> 01:13:26.758
My motive is unimportant.

01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:29.922
Let's say that I hated him enough
to kill him.

01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:34.959
You are closed man, Mr. Diamond.
You hide many things.

01:13:35.130 --> 01:13:39.123
Could it be that Mr. Twain
discover your secret?

01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:41.963
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:13:42.130 --> 01:13:45.839
We know different,
do we not, Miss Skeffington?

01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:51.278
Twain picked up Sam in a gay bar.

01:13:51.450 --> 01:13:54.487
I was working on a case. Working.

01:13:54.650 --> 01:13:56.606
Every night for six months?

01:13:56.770 --> 01:14:00.479
I got 50 bucks a day and expenses.
I hate them queeries.

01:14:01.450 --> 01:14:03.122
Twain...

01:14:03.290 --> 01:14:06.043
...had Polaroid pictures
of Sam in drag.

01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:09.998
I was in disguise.
Lots of dames go in those joints.

01:14:10.170 --> 01:14:11.888
I never kissed nobody.

01:14:12.050 --> 01:14:15.326
I never did nothing to a man
that I wouldn't do to a woman.

01:14:15.490 --> 01:14:18.129
And I didn't kill Twain.

01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:21.847
Bitch.

01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:23.921
Most interesting.

01:14:24.090 --> 01:14:28.003
All had perfect motives
for killing Twain.

01:14:28.170 --> 01:14:31.207
Wonder which one
was one who done it.

01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:34.684
We still have
the night to get through.

01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:39.207
If anyone's going to solve this,
I say we get a good night's sleep.

01:14:39.370 --> 01:14:41.838
And I suggest
we all lock our doors.

01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:44.160
One of us is a mad killer...

01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:47.128
...and not to be trusted.

01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:32.279
Who do you think is the murderer?

01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:33.963
Must sleep on it.

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:37.520
Will know in morning when wake up.

01:15:37.690 --> 01:15:39.760
What if you don't wake up?

01:15:39.930 --> 01:15:42.000
Then you did it.

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:44.001
Go sleep, please.

01:15:45.370 --> 01:15:50.080
- Good night, Dad.
- Should have adopted pussycat.

01:15:57.170 --> 01:15:59.764
Should I turn off the steam, Pop?

01:16:01.330 --> 01:16:03.366
Not steam.

01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:07.159
Someone just put
deadly snake in room.

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:10.288
Wake me when it come near bed.

01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:16.719
I want you to know, Dickie,
if you're the murderer...

01:16:16.890 --> 01:16:18.482
...I’ll still love you.

01:16:18.650 --> 01:16:22.563
It wouldn't be right for us
to make love, but I'd love you.

01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:26.200
No fear of that, pet.
Let's see what we have here.

01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:29.885
We have one missing, dead,
naked butler...

01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:32.723
...one host with
a knife in his back...

01:16:32.890 --> 01:16:35.688
...and one scorpion
crawling up our sheets.

01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:38.922
- Is that what that is?
- They can kill instantly.

01:16:39.090 --> 01:16:41.320
I suggest we don't move.

01:16:42.170 --> 01:16:43.489
For how long?

01:16:43.650 --> 01:16:46.687
Quite possibly
for the rest of our lives.

01:16:50.370 --> 01:16:53.680
Good heavens!
I know who the murderer is.

01:16:53.850 --> 01:16:55.169
Solvey-poo?

01:16:55.330 --> 01:16:59.118
Yes, Miss Withers.
The murderer is...

01:16:59.290 --> 01:17:00.564
Good God! Gas!

01:17:00.730 --> 01:17:03.198
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
I'm old.

01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:07.443
No, no. The other kind of gas.
The kind that kills.

01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:12.001
- Sometimes my gas...
- It's seeping in through the vent!

01:17:21.090 --> 01:17:23.046
It's locked from the outside.

01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:25.199
Help!

01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:28.521
Doesn't smell that bad to me.

01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:30.445
Help!

01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:46.486
Did I do right, Sam,
telling them about the gay bar?

01:17:46.650 --> 01:17:52.043
Perfect. They took the bait like a dumb
halibut. Let them think I'm a pansy.

01:17:52.210 --> 01:17:56.442
While they're suspecting me,
one of them will let his pants down.

01:17:57.650 --> 01:18:02.201
Why do you keep all those naked
muscle men magazines in your office?

01:18:02.370 --> 01:18:05.362
Suspects.
Always looking for suspects.

01:18:06.690 --> 01:18:09.363
What's that ticking sound I hear?

01:18:16.290 --> 01:18:20.920
"That ticking sound is a bomb
that will go off in 30 seconds.

01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:23.206
- Signed, the murderer."
- The door!

01:18:23.370 --> 01:18:25.486
"P.S. The door is locked."

01:18:32.410 --> 01:18:34.970
I'm sorry about this, Tess.

01:18:35.130 --> 01:18:39.601
- Me owing you all that money too.
- That's all right. What will we do?

01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:41.328
I got an idea.

01:18:41.490 --> 01:18:44.562
I don't know if this will work.
Turn around!

01:18:44.730 --> 01:18:47.767
- I'm turned.
- Whatever you do, don't turn back.

01:18:47.930 --> 01:18:49.682
- If anything...
- Do as I say.

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:55.049
- I will, Sam.
- Good. Because I think I'm gonna cry.

01:19:08.730 --> 01:19:12.564
- What are you doing in my bed?
- There's no place to sleep.

01:19:12.730 --> 01:19:14.800
Sleep in the car,
you chauffeur.

01:19:14.970 --> 01:19:17.962
Unfair. I will tell everyone
you wear a toupee.

01:19:18.130 --> 01:19:20.724
- They already know.
- Why do you wear it?

01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:22.642
I didn't know you knew.

01:19:22.810 --> 01:19:27.167
Certainly I know.
It's a terrible toupee.

01:19:29.290 --> 01:19:31.440
A bomb. Across the hall.

01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:33.646
Quickly, the door!

01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:41.521
It's locked from the outside.

01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:45.444
You look taller to me.
Why is that?

01:19:45.610 --> 01:19:47.965
Monsieur, I'm not getting taller.

01:19:48.130 --> 01:19:51.600
If you aren't getting taller,
there's one alternative.

01:19:51.770 --> 01:19:54.125
The room is getting shorter!

01:19:55.330 --> 01:19:57.924
The ceiling is coming down!

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:11.038
- What'll we do?
- I don't know!

01:20:11.210 --> 01:20:15.249
But this is exactly how
they make goose liver pâté.

01:20:45.810 --> 01:20:47.926
Not so fast, please.

01:20:48.090 --> 01:20:50.479
Do not cross out Wang name.

01:20:50.650 --> 01:20:53.687
Cross out "snake" instead.

01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:58.321
Nice shot, Pop. Sure wish you
weren't such a heavy sleeper.

01:20:58.490 --> 01:21:00.401
And now...

01:21:00.570 --> 01:21:03.289
...if you please.

01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:05.406
One million dollars...

01:21:05.570 --> 01:21:07.925
...Mr. Bensonmum.

01:21:08.090 --> 01:21:09.887
Banzai, Pop!

01:21:10.970 --> 01:21:13.040
Very clever of you, Mr. Wang.

01:21:13.210 --> 01:21:17.408
Oh, yes.
As you can see, I can see.

01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:19.606
So I see.

01:21:19.770 --> 01:21:24.002
Tell me, as the only survivor,
how did you deduce it was me?

01:21:24.170 --> 01:21:29.039
Went back to theory
seldom used today:

01:21:29.490 --> 01:21:30.843
Butler did it.

01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:34.166
I hadn't thought of that.

01:21:34.330 --> 01:21:37.128
How do you account for
my dead body?

01:21:38.130 --> 01:21:42.009
Body made of plastic,
same as plastic cook.

01:21:42.170 --> 01:21:45.242
While we examine plastic butler...

01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:47.480
...you murder Lionel Twain.

01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:51.123
You're a clever little
laundry man, Mr. Wang.

01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:53.599
But not quite clever enough!

01:21:53.770 --> 01:21:58.207
I'll take that one million dollars,
Bensonmum...

01:21:58.370 --> 01:22:00.281
...alias Irving Goldman.

01:22:01.970 --> 01:22:04.120
Irving Goldman?

01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:05.405
Yes.

01:22:05.570 --> 01:22:09.358
Irving Goldman was the attorney
of the late Lionel Twain.

01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:11.680
Lionel Twain died five years ago.

01:22:11.850 --> 01:22:15.684
His body was discovered
in Goldman's filing cabinet.

01:22:15.850 --> 01:22:18.842
Am I correct, Mr. Goldman?

01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:22.047
Yeah. Correct, Miss Marbles.

01:22:22.210 --> 01:22:24.883
But how did you escape
the poison gas?

01:22:25.050 --> 01:22:27.280
Quite simple.
I covered my mouth...

01:22:27.450 --> 01:22:31.045
...and let Miss Withers here
breathe in all the gas.

01:22:31.290 --> 01:22:34.282
- Sicky-poo.
- Yes, dear, I know.

01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:37.840
- The million dollars, please.
- I wouldn't, Goldman.

01:22:38.010 --> 01:22:39.762
Or is it Goldman?

01:22:39.930 --> 01:22:42.569
Actually, it's Mr. Marvin Metzner.

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:45.888
Marvin Metzner?

01:22:47.090 --> 01:22:50.207
Very good, Mr. Charleston.

01:22:50.370 --> 01:22:52.406
But how did you know?

01:22:52.570 --> 01:22:57.405
The bill in the dead butler's hand
stating the weekend had been catered.

01:22:57.570 --> 01:23:01.961
- Only an accountant would keep that.
- Get the money and let's go.

01:23:02.130 --> 01:23:04.690
Goldman died
last month while skiing.

01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:07.762
He jumped 200 feet
into a low-flying plane.

01:23:07.930 --> 01:23:09.568
I can't wait much longer.

01:23:09.730 --> 01:23:13.166
You've not lost your touch,
Mr. Charleston.

01:23:13.330 --> 01:23:16.242
But how did you elude
the deadly scorpion?

01:23:16.410 --> 01:23:18.002
We didn't.
He stung Dora.

01:23:18.170 --> 01:23:21.480
- We have 15 minutes to reach a doctor.
- Explain later.

01:23:21.650 --> 01:23:24.483
We'll make it. Never fear.
The prize money.

01:23:24.650 --> 01:23:26.800
Belongs to me, monsieur.

01:23:26.970 --> 01:23:30.280
Marcel, being one of
the world's strongest men...

01:23:30.450 --> 01:23:34.887
...stopped your ceiling from crushing
us at four feet, five inches.

01:23:35.050 --> 01:23:38.725
It may be months before
we're able to straighten again...

01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:43.281
...but a million dollars
will buy a lot of back braces.

01:23:43.450 --> 01:23:47.443
Eh, Miss Irene Twain?

01:23:47.610 --> 01:23:49.441
Daughter of Lionel!

01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:51.362
What?

01:23:52.450 --> 01:23:55.647
I prefer to be called Rita.

01:23:57.690 --> 01:23:59.169
But how did you know?

01:23:59.330 --> 01:24:03.323
Never underestimate
a Frenchman's nostrils, Miss Twain.

01:24:03.490 --> 01:24:05.287
At dinner tonight...

01:24:05.450 --> 01:24:08.010
...I smelled your Chanel No. 5.

01:24:08.170 --> 01:24:10.365
You did away with all of them:

01:24:10.530 --> 01:24:14.000
Metzner, Goldman
and your father.

01:24:14.170 --> 01:24:15.808
If you had your way...

01:24:15.970 --> 01:24:19.645
...you'd do away with all men,
would you not, Miss Twain?

01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:22.563
Men who have made you suffer...

01:24:22.730 --> 01:24:25.369
...because you were
born with brains...

01:24:25.530 --> 01:24:30.046
...talent, money, everything
but that which you most desired:

01:24:30.210 --> 01:24:32.007
Beauty.

01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:34.445
It is a statement of fact...

01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:37.966
...that as a man you are passable,
but as a woman...

01:24:38.130 --> 01:24:40.280
...you are a dog.

01:24:40.450 --> 01:24:44.523
That's your opinion, big boy.

01:24:45.650 --> 01:24:47.447
And now my money, please.

01:24:47.610 --> 01:24:51.922
With luck, I can still
make dinner at Maxim's.

01:24:52.090 --> 01:24:54.365
I'd just order
a tuna sandwich...

01:24:54.530 --> 01:24:56.600
...because that dough is mine.

01:24:56.770 --> 01:24:58.362
That's right, I'm alive.

01:24:58.530 --> 01:25:01.840
Miss Skeffington
dropped your bomb down the john.

01:25:02.010 --> 01:25:06.481
It blew up as she flushed.
The seat missed her head by an inch.

01:25:07.170 --> 01:25:09.365
I'm all right, J.J.

01:25:09.530 --> 01:25:11.088
J. J?

01:25:14.050 --> 01:25:17.486
That's right, folks.
He outsmarted us all.

01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:21.007
Sitting behind that desk
is the real Sam Diamond.

01:25:22.010 --> 01:25:23.329
My name is Loomis.

01:25:23.490 --> 01:25:26.926
J.J. Loomis. I'm an actor.
I do impressions.

01:25:27.090 --> 01:25:30.480
I did the Carson show
six times last year.

01:25:30.650 --> 01:25:32.880
Diamond hired me for the weekend.

01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:35.120
Miss Skeffington
is Vilma Norman.

01:25:35.290 --> 01:25:39.329
She's a cocktail waitress
at the Water Bed Motel in Carmel.

01:25:41.210 --> 01:25:42.848
Diamond hated all of you.

01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:47.367
You're getting big money, and he
had that office in San Francisco.

01:25:47.530 --> 01:25:50.488
If he proved he was number one,
he'd get your clients.

01:25:50.650 --> 01:25:53.642
But since I put
all the pieces together...

01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:58.559
...I figure that money belongs to me.

01:25:59.650 --> 01:26:01.641
Isn't that right, Mr. Diamond?

01:26:04.290 --> 01:26:05.643
Wrong.

01:26:06.290 --> 01:26:09.839
That would've been so obvious,
a child could have guessed.

01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:12.843
No, colleagues.
What you seem to overlook...

01:26:13.010 --> 01:26:15.763
...is the most simple
and direct solution.

01:26:15.930 --> 01:26:19.400
That I am indeed Lionel Twain.

01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:27.001
You've all been so clever
for so long...

01:26:27.170 --> 01:26:29.400
...you've forgotten to be humble.

01:26:29.570 --> 01:26:32.767
You've tricked and fooled
your readers for years.

01:26:32.930 --> 01:26:36.605
You've tortured us with
surprise endings that made no sense.

01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:42.163
You've introduced characters at the
end that weren't in the book before!

01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:45.527
You've withheld
clues and information...

01:26:45.690 --> 01:26:49.205
...that made it impossible for us
to guess who did it.

01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:52.726
But now the tables are turned.

01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:56.802
Millions of angry mystery readers...

01:26:56.970 --> 01:26:59.928
...are now getting their revenge.

01:27:00.090 --> 01:27:03.480
When the world learns
I've outsmarted you...

01:27:03.650 --> 01:27:07.768
...they'll be selling your $1.95 books
for 12 cents.

01:27:07.930 --> 01:27:10.649
It's checkout time,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:27:10.810 --> 01:27:13.529
I have your bills ready.

01:27:14.650 --> 01:27:16.925
Credit cards will be accepted.

01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:41.127
- Even the scorpion was a fake?
- Everything. The bridge, the maid.

01:27:41.290 --> 01:27:44.919
- But you're sure about the scorpion?
- Positive.

01:27:45.090 --> 01:27:48.719
Even the fog. He made that with
a dry ice machine. See.

01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:50.687
How awfully unromantic.

01:27:56.876 --> 01:27:59.283
Then if he really
was Lionel Twain...

01:27:59.450 --> 01:28:03.762
...you must really be Sam Diamond.
- That's right, baby.

01:28:03.930 --> 01:28:06.763
I was in disguise,
in disguise, in disguise.

01:28:06.930 --> 01:28:09.763
You work hard for
50 bucks in this racket.

01:28:09.930 --> 01:28:13.206
I guess that means we won't
see each other again.

01:28:13.306 --> 01:28:16.849
Well, that depends.
I'll be around if you need me.

01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:20.332
All you gotta do is whistle.

01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:25.052
- You know how to whistle, don't you?
- Certainly. What do you mean?

01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:28.132
Never mind. Forget it.
You ruined it.

01:28:31.889 --> 01:28:34.915
I don't understand.
Was there a murder or wasn't there?

01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:37.275
Yes. Killed good weekend.

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:39.237
Drive, please.

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:46.558
