14:11.704 --> 14:12.980
How would I know?

14:13.410 --> 14:15.654
I'm not accusing you of anything,

14:16.369 --> 14:19.089
but I believe you have
the resources to find her.

14:19.304 --> 14:21.758
So, as I say,

14:22.251 --> 14:23.868
once I see my wife,

14:23.880 --> 14:25.624
I will plead guilty.

14:26.868 --> 14:29.008
And I'll not spend
another night in that cell.

14:29.055 --> 14:30.566
We can have you transferred.

14:30.601 --> 14:32.386
You do that and I'll be killed.

14:32.589 --> 14:35.630
There isn't a jail cell in
Ontario where I would be safe.

14:35.665 --> 14:36.874
That's true.

14:37.666 --> 14:39.286
Why does that matter?

14:42.292 --> 14:45.239
If you confess to murder,
you'll most likely be hanged.

14:45.274 --> 14:46.850
I'll be no trouble.

14:47.609 --> 14:50.612
I just want my wife
back. Safe and sound.

14:51.013 --> 14:53.681
Detective Murdoch, will
this ensure your confession?

14:54.310 --> 14:55.798
It will.

14:55.918 --> 14:58.031
That's what you need, isn't it Franklin?

14:58.792 --> 15:00.426
Then let him go home.

15:06.495 --> 15:09.141
I want him under guard 24 hours a day.

15:09.176 --> 15:13.751
Of course. Detective Watts can
take one shift. I trust him.

15:13.871 --> 15:17.205
Get Horace McWorthy from
Station Five. I trust him.

15:19.088 --> 15:20.475
And Murdoch,

15:21.204 --> 15:25.641
any attempt to escape will
be met with deadly force.

15:26.971 --> 15:28.850
Just find my wife...

15:29.652 --> 15:31.869
and you can do what you want with me.

15:32.987 --> 15:35.437
Are you a sorceress or a magician?

arts of pleasing a man.

15:40.527 --> 15:43.091
Miss Bloom, I fear
you will make me blush.

15:43.161 --> 15:44.667
Oh. Now Mr. Graham,

15:44.787 --> 15:47.190
I doubt you are as innocent as all that.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.702
You seem very able
to take what you want,

15:50.822 --> 15:52.609
whether it's on offer or not.

15:52.729 --> 15:55.557
Well, I can't hide much
from you. Can I, Miss Bloom?

15:55.677 --> 15:58.579
Well, I hope you don't
find cause to, Mr. Graham...

15:59.278 --> 16:01.052
because I know what I want.

16:01.122 --> 16:02.511
And what's that?

16:02.918 --> 16:04.964
A man who takes what's his...

16:05.261 --> 16:06.679
without apology.

16:07.412 --> 16:09.266
Someone after my own heart.

16:13.272 --> 16:14.742
Nothing to fear.

16:20.510 --> 16:21.655
Open it.

16:22.277 --> 16:24.010
And don't get any ideas.

16:24.243 --> 16:27.408
It might not have bars, but
it's a cell just the same.

16:28.731 --> 16:30.678
I won't be giving you any trouble.

16:31.445 --> 16:33.724
I'd just as soon you did, Detective.

16:37.991 --> 16:40.536
I'm surprised you let the detective go.

16:41.102 --> 16:42.538
Mr. Williams did.

16:42.555 --> 16:45.218
But you edged him toward
that decision. Why?

16:45.462 --> 16:47.759
We need Detective Murdoch's confession.

16:47.794 --> 16:49.184
We need it to go forward.

16:49.213 --> 16:52.171
So, the Detective's
guilt transforms your boss

16:52.200 --> 16:54.728
- into an innocent man?
- Mr. Williams simply wants

16:54.729 --> 16:56.183
to make this city great again.

16:56.235 --> 17:00.229
A noble aim, but his partner,
Robert Graham, is far from noble.

17:00.264 --> 17:02.206
He is a hard man, I will grant you that.

17:02.240 --> 17:03.933
He's a criminal, Miss Marsh.

17:03.985 --> 17:06.717
If you spent any time in city
hall, you would know that.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.433
And he's caught your boss in his web.

17:08.462 --> 17:09.921
- Detective...
- I'm not a fool.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.589
Your boss has lined his
pockets with Mr. Graham's money

17:12.653 --> 17:14.704
and ceded half of this city to him.

17:14.751 --> 17:17.641
- Prove that.
- I doubt that I can.

17:17.681 --> 17:21.931

As, I suspect, do you.

I have to talk to you.
