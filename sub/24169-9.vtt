WEBVTT

00:35.702 --> 00:36.661
-[door opens]
-Hmm.

00:38.329 --> 00:40.123
-Hello.
-Hi there.

00:40.874 --> 00:44.502
-Is this Ruby's Clams?
-Yeah, and I'm Ruby.

00:44.586 --> 00:48.798
Oh, good morning, I'm Irving Zweeben.
I got your address from Japopo's.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.968
-Are you a clam distributor?
-Well, I'm trying to be.

00:52.051 --> 00:55.013
It's a mom-and-pop operation,
minus the pop.

00:55.096 --> 00:57.599
Got a shit ton of snap and crackle,
though.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.142
[chuckles]

00:59.517 --> 01:00.685
What's your story, Irv?

01:01.061 --> 01:04.314
Well, I'm an amateur clam grower.
A "clamateur," if you will.

01:04.814 --> 01:07.358
I just had a few questions
about going pro.

01:07.442 --> 01:11.071
Such as where do you get your clam seeds?
How many have you grown?

01:11.154 --> 01:12.739
What other restaurants
have you sold them to?

01:12.822 --> 01:14.866
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

01:14.949 --> 01:18.453
You gotta put a clam in a hot bath
before she opens up.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.289
Why don't you come inside the house?

01:21.539 --> 01:25.084
I'd love to.
But first, would you like a Danish?

01:25.168 --> 01:27.629
I don't know what you eat or don't eat,
but they're very good.

01:29.088 --> 01:32.884
Oh, I couldn't. I'm on a diet.

01:33.551 --> 01:34.385
I see.

01:38.848 --> 01:40.058
Ah, fuck it.

01:44.646 --> 01:45.480
Mm!

01:46.481 --> 01:47.440
That is good.

01:47.649 --> 01:48.483
Yeah.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.863
You looked nervous, like I wasn't
gonna like your Danish or something.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.406
Well, I put a little nutmeg in it,

01:55.490 --> 01:57.951
and I'm always afraid someone's
gonna say, "Whoa, nutmeg?"

01:58.576 --> 01:59.577
I like you, Irv.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.539
Come on, I'm gonna show you
something special.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.041
Then maybe I'll show you my clams.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.510
Starting your own
real estate business, huh?

02:15.593 --> 02:17.971
That's exciting.
I'll be praying for you.

02:18.346 --> 02:21.266
Ugh, thanks. I really need this to work.

02:21.349 --> 02:24.519
I cost us our last job
because my boss was such a fucker.

02:24.602 --> 02:25.478
Sorry. Jerk.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.939
My fucking boss was such a jerk!

02:28.189 --> 02:30.108
Whoa, easy there, coconut hands.

02:30.692 --> 02:31.693
Coconut hands?

02:31.776 --> 02:34.070
Yeah, it's an expression
for people who hit really hard.

02:34.154 --> 02:37.365
You know, because coconuts are so hard.
I came up with it myself.

02:37.448 --> 02:41.369
Well, I really think it's gonna catch on
because that's so easy to explain.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.496
I think your new business
is gonna do really well.

02:43.580 --> 02:48.209
I mean, you're so strong and tough
on the outside, and sweet on the inside.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.294
You're like, um...

02:51.045 --> 02:53.798
Well, I wanna say something else,
but the best example is a coconut.

02:53.882 --> 02:57.093
Okay, I guess I see
how you could get there again.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.887
Plus, you're so inspiring.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.389
I mean, you got me to start
painting again for Pete's sake.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.017
You're just really awesome, Sheila.

03:04.392 --> 03:05.935
Ugh. That's so nice.

03:06.019 --> 03:06.936
-[thuds]
-[Anne gasps]

03:07.770 --> 03:09.439
Holy guacamole! Are you okay?

03:10.815 --> 03:14.319
Oh, boy, getting hit in the face hurts.

03:14.402 --> 03:18.698
-Do you want me to get you some ice?
-No, it's, um... it's better now.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.784
I'm glad your painting's going well.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.912
I'd love to see it.
It's just over at Lisa's, right?

03:24.120 --> 03:25.330
Yeah, but it's not that good.

03:25.413 --> 03:28.583
I'm sure it's great.
Come on, don't be such a...

03:29.375 --> 03:31.085
All I can think of is coconut.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.253
[Sheila chuckles]

03:37.342 --> 03:41.346
It's a series.
I call it "Suspicious Objects."

03:41.429 --> 03:43.556
[suspenseful music playing]

03:51.773 --> 03:52.690
Wow.

03:55.818 --> 03:57.487
-[knocking on door]
-Yeah?

03:59.072 --> 04:01.366
-Hey, Abby.
-Hi, Eric.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.284
Just stopped by to see
if your dad needed help

04:03.368 --> 04:04.494
checking out the clam distributor.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.497
I don't know if you heard,
but to get the name,

04:07.580 --> 04:10.083
I had to engage in a pretty dangerous game
of cat and mouse.

04:10.166 --> 04:13.586
-You were the mouse, right?
-I also wanted to see if you were mad

04:13.670 --> 04:16.339
I bailed on blowing up
the fracking trailer with you.

04:16.839 --> 04:20.718
But then you just called me a "mouse,"
so I guess that's a yes?

04:20.802 --> 04:22.637
I'm not mad. I'm just busy, okay?

04:22.720 --> 04:25.348
My dad's not here.
If you wanna let him know you came by,

04:25.431 --> 04:28.184
you could always leave a trail
of tiny droppings on the kitchen counter.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.604
Okay. I'm not comfortable
doing something illegal,

04:31.688 --> 04:34.148
but if you want to, that's fine,
I'm not judging.

04:35.149 --> 04:37.986
Are you making your own explosives?
That's crazy! What's wrong with you?

04:38.069 --> 04:39.529
I'm exploring options.

04:39.612 --> 04:42.699
You bailed, so you don't get
to have an opinion, okay?

04:42.782 --> 04:44.325
Nobody likes a backseat arsonist.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.493
All right.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.955
Just so you know, you should be careful
using a hydrocarbon-based fuel

04:49.038 --> 04:50.248
as an accelerant, all right,
because it's--

04:50.331 --> 04:52.458
More volatile than available combustibles.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.710
I know, Eric.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.379
But thank you for mouse-splaining
explosives to me.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.965
Well, I could call you an animal, too.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.010
You're like an Indian mealmoth
who flies directly into a flame

05:02.093 --> 05:05.471
because it read one book from 1971
and now it knows everything.

05:05.555 --> 05:08.141
Yeah, well, at least a mealmoth
has friends it can rely on

05:08.224 --> 05:10.059
who won't flutter away
at the first sign of trouble.

05:10.143 --> 05:14.188
You know nothing of moths.
Although, that was unbelievably accurate.

05:17.859 --> 05:21.738
-Look at all these clams.
-I grow them all right here.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.073
They say you can't get
local seafood in the desert,

05:24.157 --> 05:25.992
but I'm gonna prove
those fuckers wrong.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.661
-Would you like a drink, Irv?
-No, I'm good.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.621
And have you proved those fuckers wrong?

05:30.705 --> 05:32.498
How many restaurants
have you sold these to?

05:32.832 --> 05:35.376
So far, just Japopo's.
That was my trial batch.

05:36.878 --> 05:40.381
Oh, my God. Really? Just Japopo's.
No one else has had these?

05:40.631 --> 05:43.301
No, not even me. I'm allergic.

05:43.384 --> 05:48.806
Shellfish makes my tongue swell up.
Not that I'm against things swelling up.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.808
[chuckles] Okey-dokey.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.519
Listen, Ruby, I wanna buy all of these.
All three tanks.

05:53.603 --> 05:56.898
Oh, no, these aren't for sale.
These are my house clams.

05:56.981 --> 06:00.985
Yeah, that's Kevin.
There's James, Alex, Peter--

06:01.069 --> 06:05.198
Hold up. If these are your friends,
which ones did you sell to Japopo's?

06:05.323 --> 06:06.407
The ones out back.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.784
[ominous music playing]

06:18.503 --> 06:20.129
Jesus Christ.

06:21.422 --> 06:22.715
They're one of a kind.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.635
My brother explores deepwater lakes
all over the world.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.930
He's one of those rich assholes
who develops a dangerous hobby.

06:29.013 --> 06:32.350
Anyway, he found a few of these
in some cave 90 meters deep.

06:32.558 --> 06:36.187
He knows I love clams so he smuggled a few
through Customs for me to breed.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.065
Family. What would we do without them?

06:39.148 --> 06:41.984
-Where was this lake?
-Somewhere in Serbia.

06:42.485 --> 06:43.611
Serbia.

06:46.405 --> 06:50.618
I call them "Ruby Reds."
Be careful, they bite.

06:55.331 --> 06:56.541
How many of these are there?

06:56.749 --> 06:59.669
Well, six months ago, I had four,
but they breed like crazy,

06:59.752 --> 07:01.420
and now I have 5,000.

07:02.797 --> 07:05.216
Tomorrow, I'm shipping them out
to restaurants all over the state.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.135
Oh, my God.

07:07.218 --> 07:10.471
Ruby, listen to me. You can't sell these.
They made people sick.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.723
What are you talking about?
Japopo's didn't complain.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.183
They didn't know!

07:14.267 --> 07:17.937
All right, what would it cost for me
to buy all these "Ruby Reds" right now?

07:18.104 --> 07:21.023
I'm not selling them to you.
I have buyers lined up.

07:21.107 --> 07:24.235
If this goes well, I can quit my job
at the Sleep Apnea Center.

07:24.318 --> 07:26.571
Won't have to strap wires
to those fat fucks

07:26.654 --> 07:28.364
and listen to them snore all night.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.535
First of all, no matter how this goes,
you should quit your job.

07:32.618 --> 07:35.580
And these clams are dangerous.
They have to be destroyed.

07:36.372 --> 07:39.417
Who are you?
You're not a clam hobbyist.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.795
[gasps] Do you work
for Akana International Ocean Meats?

07:42.879 --> 07:45.631
Were you sent here to seduce me
out of my inventory?

07:45.798 --> 07:49.218
No, Ruby, it's not like that.
And you came on to me.

07:50.136 --> 07:50.970
Get out.

07:55.349 --> 07:57.018
Sheila, we have a problem.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.896
Yes, we do.
You need to get to Lisa's right now.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.648
Anne is painting,
and she is putting it all together--

08:02.732 --> 08:05.485
Perspective, scale, depth...

08:05.568 --> 08:07.653
Well, we have a problem here, too.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.072
-Ah, better.
-Other side.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.699
Ah, better.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.242
<i>I saw the infected clams.</i>

08:13.493 --> 08:14.994
Ruby's is the source.

08:15.077 --> 08:18.080
Really interesting, honey.
And did you hear what I said?

08:18.164 --> 08:22.460
Anne's got it all figured out.
Artistically.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.086
You mean not artistically,

08:24.170 --> 08:26.547
but she's standing right next to you
and we're fucked?

08:26.714 --> 08:29.800
Yeah-huh.
I'll see you when you get here.

08:30.635 --> 08:31.636
Damn it!

08:32.970 --> 08:35.556
And I need to get gas. Shit!

08:37.517 --> 08:38.601
[tires screech]

08:39.852 --> 08:41.479
[Paul] We discussed this, Marsha.

08:41.562 --> 08:44.649
When we try to do too many things,
everyone ends up disappointed.

08:46.025 --> 08:49.695
All I'm saying, it's my sister's
baby shower and I wanted to be there.

08:50.154 --> 08:53.199
It's her third baby, Marsha.
A shower's tacky.

08:53.282 --> 08:56.244
And I told you the day would come
when I'd be called into service.

08:56.327 --> 08:59.664
You also said you wanted a big family,
and that day's not coming anytime soon.

09:00.039 --> 09:03.084
Can we just not?
Can we please just not?

09:03.167 --> 09:06.170
I'm sorry, I have a sacred purpose.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.471
Wow, look what you did.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.724
What did you do? What did you do?

09:18.808 --> 09:21.143
I was sitting at my easel
thinking about all the people

09:21.227 --> 09:22.937
that have disappeared
in Santa Clarita lately.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.815
Then I just started painting
the missing persons flyer for Dan.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.149
Interesting.

09:27.233 --> 09:30.361
Then I thought about Gary's finger
that was found in Dan's cubby over there,

09:30.444 --> 09:32.989
-so I just painted that.
-Interesting.

09:33.197 --> 09:37.368
I feel like there's another link between
Gary and Dan that we just don't know yet.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.080
But I couldn't figure it out,
so I took a break and painted Joel.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.207
So flattering. Thank you.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.669
-Hey, why me?
-Yeah, hey, why him?

09:46.752 --> 09:48.170
I don't know.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.631
I was painting suspicious objects
and then I just thought

09:50.715 --> 09:52.925
of that nervous smile of yours.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.805
-Yeah, that's the one.
-I'm not smiling.

09:58.347 --> 10:02.602
Hey, what's this milkshake?
That's different and fun and different.

10:02.810 --> 10:05.104
Oh, that's a tumbler full of vomit
that was found in the apartment

10:05.187 --> 10:07.648
of a missing Serbian man
who I think may have been murdered.

10:08.149 --> 10:11.694
[chuckles nervously] Wow, you're just
seeing murder everywhere.

10:12.737 --> 10:15.615
I'm starting to think
that maybe Gary and Dan

10:15.698 --> 10:17.783
didn't really know each other at all.

10:17.867 --> 10:21.412
And maybe someone planted Gary's finger
to implicate Dan,

10:21.495 --> 10:22.788
and they're both really dead.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.584
And the same person who killed them
is also killing other people,

10:26.667 --> 10:29.295
like the missing Nazi and the Serb.

10:29.378 --> 10:33.215
But who?
Who could be killing all of these people?

10:40.848 --> 10:44.101
I gotta say, that theory seems crazy.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.978
I don't wanna sound harsh,

10:46.062 --> 10:49.607
but you should burn these
before people see them and judge you.

10:50.191 --> 10:54.153
Yeah, my boss didn't buy it, either.
And that was harsh.

10:54.236 --> 10:56.447
Well, still, maybe you should listen
to your boss.

10:56.530 --> 10:57.948
He is a boss for a reason.

10:58.032 --> 11:01.118
I'm sorry if I sounded harsh,
but I need you to understand.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.955
-No one's gonna buy these.
-It's just that murder's such a downer.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.749
Maybe paint something cute.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.418
-I'd love to see your take on a baby.
-Or a lizard.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.922
-Or a lizard baby.
-Nobody's painting lizard babies.

11:13.005 --> 11:13.839
Mm-mm.

11:15.716 --> 11:16.592
[door closes]

11:16.675 --> 11:17.802
God damn it!

11:17.885 --> 11:20.638
Anne's one Nazi-in-a-wheelchair painting
away from nailing us.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.848
Well, at least her boss
doesn't believe her.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.726
And what are we supposed to do with this?

11:25.810 --> 11:29.688
I don't know. I just thought it was
a bad idea to have her staring at you

11:29.772 --> 11:31.440
while she's trying to solve our crimes.

11:31.857 --> 11:34.443
Also, we don't have any paintings of you.

11:35.152 --> 11:38.948
And if buying art isn't an effective way
to shut Anne down? What then?

11:39.490 --> 11:41.367
-We can't kill her.
-I know.

11:41.575 --> 11:44.578
-We only kill bad people.
-I know.

11:45.162 --> 11:47.123
But what if she secretly is bad?

11:47.206 --> 11:49.583
She seems nice, but it's always
the people you least expect

11:49.667 --> 11:50.876
that do the worst things.

11:51.293 --> 11:53.337
That's us. You're describing us.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.631
Yeah, it did sound familiar.

11:55.714 --> 11:58.092
[sighs] I like Anne. She's my friend.

11:58.175 --> 12:01.137
-We're not killing her.
-No, you're right. That's off the table.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.722
Can we blind her? Is that something?

12:03.806 --> 12:05.891
I don't wanna blind my friend.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.352
Plus, that sounds even harder
than killing her.

12:08.644 --> 12:12.982
Yeah, it would require a lot of precision.
And we're not precise people.

12:13.774 --> 12:17.236
I'm sorry, honey.
This whole thing is my fault.

12:17.319 --> 12:18.529
No, it's not, sweetie.

12:18.612 --> 12:21.449
It's not just Anne.
I screwed up, Joel.

12:22.366 --> 12:25.453
I never told you this, but that night
at Japopo's,

12:25.536 --> 12:27.413
I thought the clams smelled off.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.832
But back then,
I was too timid to complain.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.250
It's not your fault.

12:31.375 --> 12:34.378
-I shouldn't have eaten them.
-Please, honey, it's not you.

12:34.462 --> 12:35.713
We shouldn't have even
gone out that night.

12:35.796 --> 12:38.591
-I was supposed to cook.
-You got stuck on a work call.

12:38.674 --> 12:42.011
-We had to go out.
-Right. A work call.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.429
[knocking on door]

12:43.512 --> 12:45.556
That's probably Rick.
I called him for help.

12:46.390 --> 12:47.766
Oh, yeah.

12:48.058 --> 12:48.893
[sighs]

12:48.976 --> 12:52.938
Five thousand of these infected clams
are being shipped out tomorrow.

12:53.355 --> 12:56.734
So, if we don't do something,
the world is gonna end.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.946
Well, dang.

13:05.075 --> 13:06.327
Problem solved.

13:06.410 --> 13:09.038
Called in a favor with a friend of mine
at the health department.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.122
That's great!

13:10.206 --> 13:12.625
I couldn't even get someone on the phone.
What'd he say?

13:12.708 --> 13:14.627
Why do you assume it's a man?
Sexist.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.462
I'm sorry. What did she say?

13:16.795 --> 13:20.216
It is a man, but you should question
your assumptions.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.301
That's the only way
the world's ever gonna change.

13:22.676 --> 13:25.471
I love that your police department
made you take a sensitivity class,

13:25.554 --> 13:26.764
but I don't have time for this.

13:26.847 --> 13:30.976
There's always time to respect
the differences that make us great.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.229
I got an A.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.814
Anyway, my friend
will send someone next week

13:35.898 --> 13:37.691
-to help out with your clam problem.
-Next week?

13:37.775 --> 13:39.735
That's not good enough, Rick.
I need this handled today.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.947
Whoa, buddy. Wha--?
We've been friends a long time.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.699
I know something's been going on
with you lately.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.409
Why don't you tell me what it is?

13:49.828 --> 13:51.121
I discovered bad clams,

13:51.205 --> 13:54.250
and as a responsible citizen,
I feel I must intervene.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.171
Fine, don't tell me.

14:01.090 --> 14:04.552
-I'm sorry, Rick.
-I'm trying to be a friend to you, Joel,

14:05.302 --> 14:08.138
but you keep pushing me away,
and it's breaking my heart.

14:10.224 --> 14:13.644
Fuck the sensitivity class.
It's turned me inside out.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.730
[door slams]

14:19.358 --> 14:22.069
Rick was no help,
and I think we just broke up.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.487
I'm sorry, honey.

14:23.904 --> 14:26.657
What are we gonna do?
We've got Anne closing in on us

14:26.740 --> 14:30.160
and an army of undead clams
about to wipe out civilization.

14:30.244 --> 14:34.498
Oh, and I forgot to tell you,
I think our gardener stole another hose.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.292
God, it's just one thing after another.

14:36.792 --> 14:39.378
Okay, right now,
Anne's boss isn't taking her seriously.

14:39.461 --> 14:40.796
But these clams go out tomorrow.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.090
We need to destroy
these ginger bitches tonight.

14:43.257 --> 14:46.343
Right!
Why do you assume they're female?

14:47.344 --> 14:49.972
I just-- I don't know.
I guess I need to work on that.

14:50.431 --> 14:51.724
Sexist.

14:51.932 --> 14:54.560
Oh, you heard my conversation with Rick.
Nice.

14:56.645 --> 14:59.356
Okay, so to kill 30 tubs of clams
in a hurry,

14:59.690 --> 15:01.358
I wanted to use something
readily available.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.570
First, I tried sending
an electrical current through salt water,

15:04.653 --> 15:07.281
but our little friend just vibrated
and then ejaculated something.

15:07.364 --> 15:10.326
-Not trying to shame him.
-Perfectly natural, go on.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.619
Then I put it in antifreeze,

15:11.702 --> 15:13.662
which would've killed
one of these normal clams in seconds,

15:13.746 --> 15:15.247
but still no effect.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.749
And now it is in bleach,

15:16.957 --> 15:19.543
which is strong enough to sterilize
the urinals at Dodger Stadium

15:19.627 --> 15:22.713
and as I recently learned to get
clam ejaculate out of a lab coat.

15:29.303 --> 15:32.222
-What's cracking, clam assassins?
-The antifreeze didn't work

15:32.306 --> 15:34.266
and your mother can tell you
about the electrical current.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.559
Everything's riding on the bleach.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.937
Look, it's opening up.
They do that when they're dying.

15:38.854 --> 15:40.606
[squelching]

15:46.737 --> 15:48.530
[Eric] Definitely not dead.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.540
[all] Oh!

16:00.834 --> 16:02.294
Holy shit!

16:02.378 --> 16:03.629
-[crunching]
-Oh!

16:06.298 --> 16:10.177
He or she is eating him or her.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.766
So, not bleach?

16:18.185 --> 16:19.937
So, I'm thinking game over.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.523
What does everyone wanna do
for our last night on Earth?

16:24.441 --> 16:25.776
I've never eaten a pomegranate.

16:25.859 --> 16:28.153
I don't know, Eric.
They stain, so it's super dangerous.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.907
Look, here's what I found
in the Serbian book.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.743
They burned Pozica
to get rid of the virus.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.954
Maybe fire could destroy
these little dudes, too.

16:37.037 --> 16:39.373
Why do you assume they're male, Abby?

16:41.291 --> 16:43.919
Well, hot enough temperatures
will incinerate anything,

16:44.003 --> 16:45.754
living or dead, male or female.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.798
So why don't we just torch
the whole clam farm?

16:47.965 --> 16:50.968
Maybe because starting a big fire
is reckless and dangerous, Abby.

16:51.051 --> 16:54.263
Well, not if we work together
and have each other's backs, Eric.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.223
I can't help but notice

16:56.306 --> 16:59.476
you two are pointedly saying
each other's names in a hurtful way.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.687
Which we, damn it, don't have time
to explore.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.022
[Sheila] Right.

17:03.105 --> 17:05.274
So no open flames.
It's brush fire season.

17:05.357 --> 17:08.736
And I've already caused enough destruction
in Santa Clarita without burning it down.

17:09.528 --> 17:12.656
Ruby works nights.
We could go to her place, steal the clams,

17:12.740 --> 17:15.117
and then burn them somewhere
where we can control.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.911
-Like in our oven.
-A regular oven doesn't get hot enough.

17:17.995 --> 17:20.789
To turn these to dust,
it's gotta be above 1500 degrees.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.959
There's a big kiln at Color Me Mine.
And I have a friend who works there.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.962
Totally reliable. Wouldn't flake
at the last second. You know, a friend.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.715
You mean someone who doesn't pressure you
to do things you don't wanna do?

17:30.049 --> 17:31.925
Something is going on with these two.

17:32.259 --> 17:34.762
Teenagers. They even make
the apocalypse about them.

17:36.513 --> 17:41.268
Okay, clams, Sheriff Anne, their issues,
confronting the gardener.

17:41.351 --> 17:42.978
That feels like the right order
of importance.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.897
-I agree.
-We'll gather up the clams

17:44.980 --> 17:46.607
and meet you
at the back of Color Me Mine.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.025
We'll text you when we're on our way.

17:48.275 --> 17:51.487
And if there's any problem with the kiln,
let us know and we'll go to plan B.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.907
-Which is?
-We watch Eric eat a pomegranate.

18:08.462 --> 18:09.797
[Sheila] Wow.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.257
It's kind of beautiful.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.594
I am unbelievably sweaty.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.806
Yeah, well, Eric was just trying
to protect you against contamination

18:18.889 --> 18:22.726
in case a clam bites you,
or, God forbid, ejaculates on you.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.728
World's worst porn.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.109
[gasps]

18:30.651 --> 18:33.570
-There are so many of them.
-We should get started.

18:33.654 --> 18:36.365
We only have a few hours
until Ruby gets home.

18:36.448 --> 18:40.828
Also, I think I have an ant in here
with me.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.628
By the way, the friend of mine
who works here, it's Sven.

18:49.711 --> 18:52.464
-Are you gonna be okay with that?
-Obviously you didn't think I would be

18:52.548 --> 18:54.133
or you would've mentioned it
on the drive over.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.301
-But, yes, I'm okay with that.
-Okay, good.

18:56.385 --> 18:59.471
'Cause in order to get what we want,
I'm gonna flirt a little.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.974
Whatever you have to do, do it.
I'll be fine.

19:02.057 --> 19:03.851
-Okay.
-Hey, sorry, guys, we're closed.

19:04.351 --> 19:05.227
Oh.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.145
Hey, Abby.

19:07.312 --> 19:09.481
-Hi, Sven.
-God damn it.

19:09.982 --> 19:13.652
I was wondering if you wanted
to see a movie together after you...

19:13.735 --> 19:15.112
get off.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.573
Yeah, sure. Why is he here?

19:19.700 --> 19:22.119
He's doing a super secret pottery project,

19:22.202 --> 19:25.122
and I would just consider it a huge favor

19:25.205 --> 19:29.418
if you could let him use
your hot, hot kiln while...

19:30.085 --> 19:34.214
you and I are share
a lick<i>-</i>orice<i> </i>and a Butt<i>-</i>erfinger.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.884
Um, no, I can't leave him alone
with the kiln.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.635
What if he burns the entire place down?

19:38.719 --> 19:41.221
I could be arrested, kiss college goodbye.

19:41.471 --> 19:42.848
But kiss me hello.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.268
Abby, I don't think it's working.

19:48.103 --> 19:50.272
I apologize.
This is a new muscle for me.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.649
Look, Sven, I was in your English class.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.902
You're gonna be at this Color Me Mine
the rest of your life

19:54.985 --> 19:56.820
unless someone writes
your college essays for you.

19:57.362 --> 20:01.033
Which I will do
if you leave us the keys and walk away.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.870
All right.
Text me when you're done.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.374
Thanks for doing that.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.293
-No problem.
-Listen.

20:12.211 --> 20:16.256
I was a dick before. You do a lot for me
and I'm sorry I forgot that for a minute.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.593
-It's okay.
-No. I don't like a lot of people.

20:19.676 --> 20:22.888
So I can't afford to be pissing off
the ones I do like.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.892
-So, are we good?
-Yeah.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.727
Color Me "Fine."

20:28.810 --> 20:29.770
[chuckles]

20:29.853 --> 20:32.648
That reminds me, please, please
don't tell anyone about my flirting.

20:32.814 --> 20:35.567
-Don't worry. I couldn't even describe it.
-I deserve that.

20:39.571 --> 20:40.864
Halfway through.

20:42.032 --> 20:46.411
-You're such a good man.
-[scoffs] You don't need to say that.

20:46.870 --> 20:52.167
Seriously, you're the best husband
an undead wife could ever ask for.

20:52.751 --> 20:57.714
Putting up with Nazis,
murder, suspicious cops.

20:58.465 --> 20:59.967
And you lost your best friend today

21:00.050 --> 21:02.469
because I had to order the clams
at Japopo's.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.680
You didn't do anything wrong.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.641
Look at how red these shells are.
I should've noticed.

21:08.016 --> 21:12.104
They were drenched in marinara
and the battery in our candle was dead.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.940
I wanted the chicken marsala,
but the waiter said,

21:15.023 --> 21:18.402
"We have one special left,"
and it felt exclusive, and I'm so stupid.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.404
-Sheila.
-What?

21:20.904 --> 21:22.864
It wasn't your fault. It was mine.

21:24.324 --> 21:27.536
-What are you talking about?
-I'm the reason you died.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.503
That night we went to Japopo's,
I was supposed to cook dinner.

21:36.670 --> 21:39.631
-Right, but you had a work call.
-I lied.

21:40.048 --> 21:42.009
You weren't home, I smoked a little pot,

21:42.092 --> 21:45.804
and instead of cooking,
I watched "Epic Dog Fails" on YouTube.

21:46.346 --> 21:51.393
Then I wanted pizza, so I told you I got
stuck on a work call and we had to go out.

21:52.019 --> 21:58.317
So all this happened because you got high
and wanted to watch a stupid dog video?

21:59.651 --> 22:01.236
Yes. It's my fault.

22:01.987 --> 22:02.988
Oh, my God.

22:04.489 --> 22:05.699
Wait a minute.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.994
-I sent you that video.
-You did?

22:09.077 --> 22:10.495
So maybe this is my fault.

22:10.871 --> 22:16.251
But Evelyn gave me that video from work,
and her mom gave it to her.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.378
You think this is Evelyn's mom's fault?

22:18.462 --> 22:20.714
Maybe it's the dogs in that video

22:20.797 --> 22:23.175
who think they can make sharp turns
on linoleum.

22:23.508 --> 22:26.803
Maybe it's cavemen
who decided to turn wolves into pets.

22:26.887 --> 22:30.599
So you're saying it's everybody's fault?
But mostly cavemen?

22:30.891 --> 22:33.185
No. I'm saying it's nobody's fault.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.189
Joel...

22:39.149 --> 22:40.734
it's nobody's fault.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.196
Thank you.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.075
[crickets chirping]

22:51.495 --> 22:55.332
I'm coming for you,
you clam-thieving motherfuckers.

23:00.962 --> 23:04.800
Besides, maybe it's a good thing
that it happened to us.

23:05.801 --> 23:06.885
How is it good?

23:07.052 --> 23:09.387
Because we're trying to stop it
from spreading.

23:09.471 --> 23:11.515
And maybe someone else
wouldn't even care.

23:11.723 --> 23:14.476
Right. Maybe we are good people.

23:14.810 --> 23:16.311
I'm gonna go with we are.

23:18.313 --> 23:20.023
Not from where I'm standing.

23:21.274 --> 23:24.402
Irving, you thieving son of a bitch.
Get out of my tubs.

23:24.528 --> 23:28.740
Ruby, I can explain.
I'm bringing you more clams in these bags.

23:29.866 --> 23:31.910
-Bullshit.
-Ruby, listen to me.

23:31.993 --> 23:33.620
What Isaac is trying to say--

23:33.954 --> 23:35.080
-Irving.
-Irving.

23:35.163 --> 23:37.707
Oh, okay. Well, you know what?
I didn't have anything anyway.

23:37.791 --> 23:40.752
First, you waltz in here this morning
trying to seduce me.

23:41.002 --> 23:43.588
Then you send your two lackeys
to interrogate me.

23:43.964 --> 23:47.467
I was halfway to work before I realized
my clams might be in danger.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.177
Wait, did you say "lackeys"?

23:49.261 --> 23:51.763
What lackeys?
We don't have any lackeys.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.807
[rocket whizzes, explodes]

23:53.890 --> 23:55.433
-[Sheila gasps]
-[Joel] Oh!

23:55.517 --> 23:56.935
What the fuck?

24:02.482 --> 24:03.358
You missed.

24:03.441 --> 24:05.819
Thank you, Marsha.
That's great feedback.

24:06.403 --> 24:09.948
-What the hell happened?
-It's like a bomb went off.

24:10.031 --> 24:13.702
Christ, I had no idea the seafood business
was this competitive.

24:14.327 --> 24:16.037
-[rocket whizzes]
-[glass shatters]

24:16.121 --> 24:17.706
-[explosion]
-[all gasping]

24:21.334 --> 24:22.335
[Joel] God...

24:23.920 --> 24:26.006
Oh, my God. No!

24:28.592 --> 24:31.011
Okay, that's it. I'm out, you win.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.847
Please, just spare my house clams.

24:33.930 --> 24:36.474
-We didn't do this.
-Yeah, we're good people.

24:36.641 --> 24:39.186
-I think we should run.
-I agree.

24:43.523 --> 24:46.693
Holy fuck, it worked. You did it!

24:47.194 --> 24:50.697
Now all we have to do is track down
whoever ate those clams and kill them.

24:50.822 --> 24:52.157
Totally.

24:53.950 --> 24:55.160
What are you looking at?

24:55.243 --> 24:59.539
-You. Let's go home and make a baby.
-Don't say that if you don't mean it.

24:59.623 --> 25:02.209
Don't look beautiful
if you don't want me to love you.

25:03.501 --> 25:04.544
[Paul moans]

25:06.421 --> 25:09.049
-[Joel] Who the hell did that?
-I don't know, but they're serious.

25:09.132 --> 25:11.384
No one casually owns a rocket launcher.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.597
Do you think it was those lackeys
Ruby was talking about?

25:15.680 --> 25:16.514
Maybe.

25:16.723 --> 25:20.185
Well, if they knew about the clams,
how long until they find out about us?

25:20.268 --> 25:21.937
This seems like a conversation
we could have

25:22.020 --> 25:24.022
-while getting the fuck out of here!
-Right.

25:24.105 --> 25:26.566
-[engine revs]
-[tires screech]

25:33.740 --> 25:35.033
-Here.
-Thank you.

25:35.909 --> 25:38.495
I texted Abby and told her
we destroyed the clams.

25:38.578 --> 25:42.374
-You said we destroyed the clams?
-Yeah. I figured we could use a win.

25:42.457 --> 25:44.668
We saved the world. Almost.

25:44.751 --> 25:47.420
Yeah, it's not our fault
someone saved it first.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.172
-[knocking on door]
-It's Anne.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.257
-Shit!
-[Joel sighs]

26:04.312 --> 26:05.939
-Hi, Anne.
-Hi.

26:06.022 --> 26:08.817
I just came over to say thank you.
You know, when you guys told me

26:09.109 --> 26:11.778
that my theory on the missing people
was half-baked?

26:11.861 --> 26:14.155
It was a little runny in the middle, yes.

26:14.239 --> 26:17.158
Well, your skepticism made me dig deeper.

26:17.701 --> 26:21.288
And I looked more into that missing Nazi,
and it turns out that he dated,

26:21.371 --> 26:22.831
wait for it...

26:22.914 --> 26:24.666
Gary's niece.

26:25.041 --> 26:25.875
[both] Whoa.

26:25.959 --> 26:28.753
And two more Nazis
have also gone missing.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.255
[both] Whoa.

26:30.338 --> 26:34.676
Yeah. It's all connecting. I told my boss
and he wants me to take it to Homicide.

26:35.218 --> 26:36.803
-Homicide?
-Homicide.

26:36.970 --> 26:40.140
Yeah, once those guys sink their teeth
into something, there's no letting up.

26:40.223 --> 26:43.935
So by next week, there could be a whole
team of detectives working on this.

26:44.102 --> 26:47.272
-But... but what about painting lizards?
-Yeah.

26:47.355 --> 26:49.524
-Where are the fucking lizards, Anne?
-Right here.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.446
It's a baby one, like you wanted,
as a thank-you.

26:54.529 --> 26:56.489
If you hadn't warned me
how weak my theory was,

26:56.573 --> 26:59.659
then I would've kept pushing it to my boss
and I would've lost all credibility.

27:00.910 --> 27:03.038
-You're welcome.
-Anyway, I gotta get going.

27:03.121 --> 27:07.250
Lisa's baptism is tomorrow and I'm
putting together a banging pray-list.

27:07.334 --> 27:08.460
[Joel chuckles nervously]

27:10.003 --> 27:11.379
See you there!

27:12.672 --> 27:14.466
-Homicide detectives!
-I know!

27:14.549 --> 27:16.634
Remember an hour ago when someone
shot a rocket at us?

27:16.718 --> 27:19.637
-Yeah.
-What if those were the good times?

27:20.180 --> 27:21.389
[exhales]
