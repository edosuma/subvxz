WEBVTT

00:04.129 --> 00:05.588
Hey, Kel, come on. Chop chop.

00:05.672 --> 00:07.257
{\an3}We're gonna be late.
Oh, I know, I'm coming.

00:07.340 --> 00:08.800
This article's so

00:08.883 --> 00:10.218
good, I can't put it down.

00:10.301 --> 00:11.928
What's it about?

00:12.011 --> 00:14.264
It's by this woman,
Emma Bennett.

00:14.347 --> 00:15.598
She, uh, writes
about Generation Y,

00:15.682 --> 00:17.475
and she's talking
about all the stupid jobs

00:17.559 --> 00:20.770
she's taken since she graduated
from college in June.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.564
{\an3}Emma Bennett--
I've heard of her.

00:22.647 --> 00:24.482
{\an3}She's, like, some
local whiz kid.

00:24.566 --> 00:29.279
{\an3}Started publishing when she
was still a sophomore at USC.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.281
She's great. You should get her
to write something for the <i> Beat.</i>

00:31.364 --> 00:32.741
{\an3}I don't know
if she'd go for that.

00:32.824 --> 00:36.578
{\an3}We're not exactly as slick
as the <i> L.A. Chronicle.</i>

00:36.661 --> 00:38.413
{\an1}I don't know.
It might be good.

00:38.496 --> 00:40.623
{\an1}She has
a good following, I bet.

00:40.707 --> 00:43.376
Well, maybe I will.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.553
{\an1}You're a real pro
with that spatula, huh?

00:53.636 --> 00:56.014
{\an3}You should see what
I can do with a whisk.

00:56.097 --> 00:58.266
I can imagine.

00:58.349 --> 01:00.518
{\an1}This was really sweet
of you to invite me

01:00.602 --> 01:01.811
over here for breakfast.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.813
I wanted to see you.

01:03.897 --> 01:07.108
Hello?

01:07.192 --> 01:08.318
Mom, hi.

01:08.401 --> 01:09.402
{\an1}Sweetheart,
there must be

01:09.486 --> 01:10.653
something wrong
with your phone.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.489
I've been trying
to reach you for an hour.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.866
Yeah, I've been meaning
to use the cell phone

01:14.949 --> 01:16.034
and call the phone company.

01:16.117 --> 01:18.953
Well, this is some breakfast.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.164
Noah, what brings you here
at this hour?

01:21.247 --> 01:23.333
I invited him.

01:23.416 --> 01:24.459
Oh.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.252
{\an3}You know, we have
plenty of food.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.462
Would you like to join us?

01:27.545 --> 01:28.546
No, no,

01:28.630 --> 01:29.422
{\an1}thank you.

01:29.506 --> 01:30.673
I don't think Noah can stay,
either.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.967
You've got a lot to do to get
that boat ready for the auction.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.552
It's all done, Mrs. Martin.

01:34.636 --> 01:35.553
The whole list?

01:36.596 --> 01:37.305
{\an3}All of it.

01:37.388 --> 01:38.306
So how come Noah had

01:38.389 --> 01:39.641
to tell me and you didn't?

01:39.724 --> 01:41.684
I guess I was putting it off

01:41.768 --> 01:43.436
because I knew
it would upset you.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.063
Well, I'm not a baby.

01:45.146 --> 01:45.980
I know, I know.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.190
It's just that, uh,

01:47.273 --> 01:48.316
we don't use the boat anymore.

01:48.399 --> 01:50.693
Your father has decided
to devote himself full-time

01:50.777 --> 01:52.695
{\an1}to charity work.
No, Mom, that's-that's fine.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.572
I just wish you would've told
me, that's all.

01:54.656 --> 01:55.907
All right, I'm sorry.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.368
The auction is Thursday.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.869
{\an1}Your father is at
a conference all week.

01:59.953 --> 02:00.912
I was hoping

02:00.995 --> 02:03.164
that you would bring David
to the, uh, auction

02:03.248 --> 02:04.207
{\an1}with you.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.877
(sighs) I've got a million
things on my mind,

02:07.961 --> 02:09.838
and I've been getting these
terrible migraines.

02:09.920 --> 02:10.713
Have you got any aspirin?

02:10.797 --> 02:12.882
Yeah, uh, the top shelf
in the bathroom.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.551
Oh.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.931
This smells great.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.851
{\an3}So ha-have you thought about
where you're gonna live?

02:22.934 --> 02:24.561
{\an1}No, I haven't
figured it out yet.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.729
{\an3}Well, if I thought
you were poor,

02:26.813 --> 02:30.733
{\an3}I'd take care of you:
shelter, meals, a warm bed.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.610
{\an1}How about a vow
of poverty?

02:32.694 --> 02:33.820
{\an3}Mm.

02:35.822 --> 02:36.739
Excuse me!

02:36.823 --> 02:38.908
Mom...

02:38.992 --> 02:40.743
Could I see you alone
for a minute?

02:40.827 --> 02:42.704
Sure.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.209
(sighs)

02:50.336 --> 02:51.588
What are you doing?

02:51.671 --> 02:52.922
Where is David?

02:53.006 --> 02:55.675
Look, I-I meant to tell you this
before, Mom.

02:55.758 --> 02:58.094
David and I broke up.

02:58.177 --> 03:01.139
What? When?

03:01.222 --> 03:03.558
A few weeks ago.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.351
And I'm seeing Noah now.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.270
(gasps)

03:07.353 --> 03:08.813
I don't believe this.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.940
{\an3}You told me you were madly
in love with David,

03:11.024 --> 03:13.610
that you wanted to spend the
rest of your life with him.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.278
Well, it's a long story.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.614
Things just got complicated.

03:17.697 --> 03:20.950
Please, sweetheart, tell me
you're not spending time

03:21.034 --> 03:22.118
with this wharf rat.

03:22.201 --> 03:23.745
Mom, he's not who
you think he is.

03:23.828 --> 03:26.080
Oh, I know exactly who he is.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.833
No, you're completely jumping
to conclusions,

03:28.917 --> 03:30.293
judging him
without even knowing him.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.920
The same way you did with David.

03:32.003 --> 03:34.088
Oh, no. At least David
didn't work on a boat.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.799
I can't believe how
superficial you are.

03:36.883 --> 03:40.136
All right, call it whatever you
want to call it.

03:40.219 --> 03:42.305
But sweetheart,
it's becoming real clear

03:42.388 --> 03:44.182
that you're not making
very smart choices.

03:44.265 --> 03:46.476
Mom, please, don't tell me how
to run my life.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.311
{\an1}I'm just...
No.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.980
I'm an adult now,
and you can't just walk in here

03:51.064 --> 03:52.732
and take over my life.

03:52.815 --> 03:54.859
It doesn't work anymore.

(laughs)

05:53.311 --> 05:56.773
{\an1}It's not as fancy as the
Foundation's offices, but....

05:56.856 --> 05:58.107
But it's so
much better.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.067
I didn't take that job

05:59.150 --> 06:02.111
to sit behind a desk
and go to charity balls.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.113
That's fine,
but I didn't really feel

06:04.197 --> 06:05.573
like I was making a difference.

06:05.656 --> 06:06.574
Whereas here, it's...

06:06.657 --> 06:07.950
Well, you get immediate

06:08.034 --> 06:09.077
confirmation.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.078
{\an3}Yes.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.245
It's so great to feel needed.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.623
To be able to help people
every single day, you know?

06:13.706 --> 06:15.083
That's why I became a doctor.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.293
That and the fact that
I couldn't carry a tune.

06:17.376 --> 06:18.961
{\an5}(chuckles)
NURSE:
Dr. Monahan,

06:19.045 --> 06:20.296
Mrs. Pattaya just came in!

06:20.379 --> 06:21.631
How is she?

06:21.714 --> 06:23.758
Her husband must've been
pretty angry.

06:23.841 --> 06:24.717
What I wouldn't give

06:24.801 --> 06:26.469
to have three minutes alone
with that guy.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.930
Is there anything I can do?

06:29.013 --> 06:31.349
Oh, yeah, comfort the sick,
console the needy,

06:31.432 --> 06:33.142
fight the state
for reimbursements

06:33.226 --> 06:34.811
and make sure
the electricity bill's

06:34.894 --> 06:35.978
paid on time.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.688
I can do that.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.609
I think.

06:43.194 --> 06:46.030
(boat horn blows)

06:48.783 --> 06:50.326
(grunts) Morning.

06:50.409 --> 06:52.495
What do you want, Val?

06:52.578 --> 06:53.788
I don't know.

06:53.871 --> 06:54.997
A house on the beach.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.042
(sighs) My own private plane.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.503
That's funny.

07:00.586 --> 07:05.800
Look, the After Dark was a huge
part of my life for a long time.

07:05.883 --> 07:08.219
{\an3}It was kind of like home
to me, you know?

07:08.302 --> 07:10.138
The point is?

07:10.221 --> 07:13.307
Well, I was wondering what you
were planning on doing with it.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.350
Why?

07:14.433 --> 07:16.060
Because I can run it.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.521
{\an5}I haven't decided what I'm gonna
do with it yet.
Tell me you're

07:18.604 --> 07:19.856
not planning on running it
yourself.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.858
And what if I was?

07:21.941 --> 07:23.609
{\an3}Why would you want
to run a club?

07:23.693 --> 07:25.278
I mean, if I had your money,
I wouldn't.

07:25.361 --> 07:27.196
{\an3}Maybe I'd enjoy it.
David couldn't

07:27.280 --> 07:29.198
do it alone, so what makes
you think you can, huh?

07:29.282 --> 07:32.368
Look, I'm not completely
incompetent, okay?

07:32.451 --> 07:35.371
Besides, it can't be all that
bad if you want to do it.

07:35.454 --> 07:36.372
{\an3}The club's
important to me.

07:36.455 --> 07:39.208
It's not just some phase
that I'm going through.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.960
I care what happens to it.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.922
Well, you have no idea
what's important to me, okay?

07:45.006 --> 07:46.215
{\an3}I know what
I see.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.842
It's not some big work ethic.

07:47.925 --> 07:48.843
{\an1}Hey, look,

07:48.926 --> 07:49.927
I am not lazy.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.220
{\an3}You're an
outdoor person.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.346
I mean, that means
you're gonna be

07:52.430 --> 07:54.307
inside working
at least 15 hours.

07:54.390 --> 07:55.516
See, I'm starting to think

07:55.600 --> 07:57.059
this isn't about the club
at all, is it?

07:57.143 --> 07:58.352
{\an3}This is not
about us, Noah.

07:58.436 --> 08:01.898
You can go out with Donna all
you want, I really don't care.

08:01.981 --> 08:05.359
But I care about the club...
a lot.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.528
You just don't think I can run
it by myself, right?

08:07.612 --> 08:09.697
It's more like I know I can.

08:09.780 --> 08:13.075
I already made a decision.
End of story.

08:20.625 --> 08:21.709
(knocking)

08:21.792 --> 08:23.085
Hey.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.962
{\an1}Silver!
What's up, man?

08:25.046 --> 08:25.963
Unemployment.

08:26.047 --> 08:26.964
Got any leads?

08:27.048 --> 08:28.216
Uh, actually,
I was hoping

08:28.299 --> 08:29.550
{\an3}to check out your
classifieds.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.093
{\an1}Right there.
Knock yourself out.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.385
Thanks.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.267
(sighs)

08:38.351 --> 08:40.770
{\an3}Ah,

08:40.852 --> 08:43.313
Cupcake Central is looking
for a new cake decorator.

08:43.397 --> 08:44.440
{\an1}STEVE: Oh, yeah?
What's it pay?

08:44.524 --> 08:46.776
Two bucks an hour plus all the
frosting you can eat?

08:46.859 --> 08:48.027
(chuckles)

08:48.110 --> 08:50.071
That's very helpful,
Steve. Thank you.

08:50.154 --> 08:51.781
If I were you, Dave,

08:51.864 --> 08:53.449
I'd patch things up with Noah.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.159
Boogie back over
to the After Dark.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.911
I'd rather be an employer
than an employee.

08:56.994 --> 08:58.621
Yeah, well, you're not me.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.873
{\an3}Isn't it worth a...?
You know,

09:00.957 --> 09:03.334
if I never hear the name Noah
Hunter again, it'll be too soon.

09:03.417 --> 09:04.460
{\an3}All right? It seems
like every time

09:04.543 --> 09:06.837
he comes around, he ruins some
other part of my life.

09:06.921 --> 09:07.755
{\an1}BRANDON: Am I missing
something here?

09:07.838 --> 09:09.465
All the guy did was bail you
out, bro.

09:09.548 --> 09:11.300
Yeah, he's a real pal.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.636
Wait, Silver, if you'd check
your ego at the door,

09:13.719 --> 09:14.637
I think maybe you'd...

09:14.720 --> 09:15.638
He's seeing Donna.

09:15.721 --> 09:16.973
Whoops.

09:17.056 --> 09:17.807
For real?

09:17.890 --> 09:18.975
Yeah, for real.

09:19.058 --> 09:20.184
I really don't appreciate

09:20.268 --> 09:21.727
you taking his side on this,
Brandon.

09:21.811 --> 09:22.812
Silver...

09:22.895 --> 09:23.854
Really.

09:33.572 --> 09:36.325
Honey, we're gonna be late
for our reservation!

09:36.409 --> 09:38.452
{\an1}Hold your horses, cowboy.
I'm trying to tell Mom

09:38.536 --> 09:40.788
what Zach has to do
for school tomorrow.

09:40.871 --> 09:43.457
{\an1}Okay, so he also needs
to draw a picture of the house

09:43.541 --> 09:44.875
{\an1}and everyone
who lives in it.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.461
{\an3}Oh, okay, it'll
be a Picasso.

09:47.545 --> 09:48.921
Okay, you guys get going.

09:49.005 --> 09:49.922
Thanks.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.966
Zach? Zach, honey?

09:52.049 --> 09:53.301
Your mommy's going.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.177
{\an3}We're talking dinner,
drinks and then dessert

09:55.261 --> 09:56.637
{\an3}at my father's house
in Malibu.

09:56.721 --> 09:57.847
Oh. Is he gonna be there?

09:57.930 --> 10:00.808
{\an3}Oh, no. Conveniently, he's in
Portland with the family.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.518
{\an3}I told him I'd
watch it for him.

10:02.601 --> 10:04.854
{\an3}Did I mention
it's a beach house?

10:04.937 --> 10:06.480
Mm...
Mm...

10:06.564 --> 10:08.607
{\an3}Hey, buddy,
how you doing?

10:08.691 --> 10:11.277
{\an1}(weakly):
Okay.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.404
{\an3}You gonna be a good boy
for Grandma?

10:13.487 --> 10:14.530
Yes.

10:14.613 --> 10:16.824
You're the best.

10:18.492 --> 10:21.245
Let met try that again.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.205
Is he okay?

10:23.289 --> 10:24.206
No.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.500
My tummy hurts.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.002
{\an3}I know.
Come here, sweetie.

10:28.085 --> 10:29.003
He's burning up.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.546
You want me to get some aspirin?

10:30.629 --> 10:31.380
{\an1}DORIS:
No.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.341
I'll get it, along
with a thermometer.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.885
{\an1}CARLY: I'm sorry.
I know you had

10:35.968 --> 10:37.053
a romantic night planned.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.764
It's okay. It's not your fault.

10:39.847 --> 10:42.516
Come on, honey. Let's go to bed.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.060
I'll order in
some Thai food, okay?

10:44.143 --> 10:45.394
That'd be great.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.317
STEVE:
<i>There goes my sex life.</i>

10:57.615 --> 11:00.576
{\an1}Sorry to hear
about the club, pal.

11:00.659 --> 11:01.994
No big deal.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.205
{\an3}Guess it's just time
to move on.

11:04.288 --> 11:05.748
Got any leads?

11:05.831 --> 11:07.083
Yeah, starting tomorrow,

11:07.166 --> 11:09.085
I'll be working
at Khaki Nation.

11:09.168 --> 11:12.171
{\an1}Well at least you'll be
well-dressed.

11:14.965 --> 11:17.551
{\an1}David, I've been thinking
about the club

11:17.635 --> 11:18.594
and the whole situation.

11:18.677 --> 11:21.472
{\an1}If you think about it,
it's kind of stupid, you know?

11:21.555 --> 11:23.099
{\an1}I mean, you put a lot
of energy into

11:23.182 --> 11:24.433
the After Dark.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.102
You deserve to have it.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.937
What are you saying?

11:28.020 --> 11:30.272
Look, I'm saying that
it's all yours, okay?

11:30.356 --> 11:31.774
No strings attached.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.778
Well, I don't want your charity.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.071
Look, it's not...

11:37.154 --> 11:39.031
You had some financial problems.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.117
I bailed you out,
it's no big deal.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.994
Donna talk you into this?

11:44.078 --> 11:46.288
She doesn't even know I'm here.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.165
So, come on, help me out, man.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.750
Get this place off my hands.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.836
No, thanks.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.587
I don't want it, it's yours.

11:53.671 --> 11:56.465
At least let me pay for some of
the assets that are still here.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.675
You got furniture, equipment.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.468
{\an3}Don't do me any more
favors, all right?

11:59.552 --> 12:01.637
You got my girl,
you got the club.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.972
{\an3}(scoffs)

12:03.055 --> 12:05.641
Congratulations.

12:05.724 --> 12:08.102
Thanks to you, my life's ruined.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.105
(door opens)

12:11.188 --> 12:12.648
(sighs)

12:12.731 --> 12:13.732
(door shuts)

12:16.068 --> 12:17.319
Hey.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.448
Hey, what's your big hurry?

12:20.531 --> 12:21.866
I want to get to work early.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.826
{\an1}Dr. Monahan has
a full day ahead.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.995
Hmm, you've really taken
to this guy, haven't you?

12:26.078 --> 12:27.830
Yeah, he is amazing.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.874
I mean, the guy left
a thriving practice

12:29.957 --> 12:31.709
to help poor women
at a free clinic.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.377
And the hours he keeps.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.837
He's never tired.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.423
He sounds almost perfect.

12:37.506 --> 12:39.800
He is, of course, ugly.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.677
{\an3}Actually, he's
kind of handsome.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.179
Really?

12:43.262 --> 12:44.680
But he's no Brandon Walsh.

12:44.763 --> 12:47.016
I'm sure he hears
that all the time.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.977
Yeah, probably
from his wife.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.353
He's married.
Glad to hear it.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.521
Hmm.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.523
Hey, I almost
forgot to tell you.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.026
Emma Bennett's coming in to meet
with us today about writing

12:57.109 --> 12:58.569
an article for us.
Ooh, that's great.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.571
{\an1}Yeah, I mean she
hasn't said yes yet, but

13:00.654 --> 13:02.573
{\an1}assuming she does,
full credit goes to you

13:02.656 --> 13:03.699
for suggesting I call her.

13:03.782 --> 13:06.410
Well, I don't exactly have
your power of persuasion.

13:06.494 --> 13:09.079
No, you don't, but we do make
a pretty good team, don't we?

13:09.163 --> 13:10.581
{\an3}Yes, the best.
Mm-hmm.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.208
{\an3}I gotta go.
I'll call you later, okay?

13:12.291 --> 13:13.542
{\an1}Okay.

13:13.626 --> 13:17.004
Hey, you forgot your breakfast.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.518
Okay, T-shirts with ribs
are over in that corner,

13:30.601 --> 13:31.727
and smooth T-shirts are here.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.437
Never, ever put
the two together.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.314
{\an3}Why not?

13:35.397 --> 13:36.732
Didn't you read your
Khaki Nation manual?

13:36.815 --> 13:38.734
Mixing textures
violates company policy.

13:38.817 --> 13:41.070
Why?

13:41.153 --> 13:43.197
{\an1}Good employees follow policy,
they don't question it.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.282
{\an1}And mixing confuses
the customers.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.868
Now, one of the basic keys
to a successful career

13:47.952 --> 13:50.704
at Khaki Nation is to sell
your customers an entire outfit.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.165
Remember, accessories are
what give a person style.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.042
So, don't just stop
at T-shirts and pants.

13:55.125 --> 13:58.546
There's a whole world of socks,
hats, glasses and hair wear.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.089
{\an1}Hair wear?

14:00.172 --> 14:01.382
You know, David,
an awful lot of people

14:01.465 --> 14:02.758
would kill to have your job.

14:02.841 --> 14:04.593
{\an3}If you're not going to bring
the right attitude...

14:04.677 --> 14:06.220
(laughing):
I'm sorry. I...

14:06.303 --> 14:08.097
I've never heard the term
"hair wear" before.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.100
Well, bandannas, headbands,
barrettes and baseball hats.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.268
You with me?

14:12.351 --> 14:13.435
Yeah, I'm with you.

14:13.519 --> 14:14.436
Good.

14:14.520 --> 14:18.941
Now, on to the
art of folding.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.859
Let's see how you do.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.533
You know what?

14:27.616 --> 14:29.034
You have a lot to learn.

14:36.875 --> 14:38.794
(chuckling): Why all
the cloak and dagger?

14:38.877 --> 14:40.087
No one's home.

14:40.170 --> 14:41.297
I just want to be sure.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.091
{\an3}We drove around the block
three times checking for cars.

14:44.174 --> 14:45.718
You called the house
and no one answered

14:45.801 --> 14:47.636
{\an3}and when we walked in,
you yelled "Hello!"

14:47.720 --> 14:49.096
loud enough to wake the dead.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.973
{\an1}Nothing wrong with
taking a few precautions.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.641
{\an3}(giggling)

14:52.725 --> 14:54.310
You're insane.
Yes, I'm insane.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.603
We don't have that much time.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.479
I have to pick up
Zach in an hour.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.106
How's he feeling?
Oh, he's better.

14:59.189 --> 15:01.150
{\an3}Had like a 24-hour
bug, you know.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.652
{\an1}Did I ever tell you how sexy
you are in this uniform?

15:03.736 --> 15:04.987
About a million times.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.280
(grunts)

15:07.615 --> 15:08.991
{\an1}VALERIE:
Hey, kids.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.826
{\an1}Sorry to break this
to you, but, um,

15:10.909 --> 15:12.494
see, Joe here's got
to smoke the place.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.662
Now?

15:13.746 --> 15:14.955
No time like the present.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.165
{\an3}CARLY:
What do you mean

15:16.248 --> 15:17.499
smoke?

15:17.583 --> 15:19.001
Extermination.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.337
{\an1}It seems that we have a
little problem with mites.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.671
{\an3}Can't he start
in another room?

15:22.755 --> 15:24.506
{\an1}Honey, he's gotta
do the whole place.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.134
{\an1}We gotta be out of here
like... Joe, three hours?

15:27.217 --> 15:30.054
Four to five
for maximum termination.

15:31.430 --> 15:32.806
(sighing)

15:32.890 --> 15:34.516
Sorry.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.020
TERRI:
<i>Brandon Walsh,</i>

15:38.103 --> 15:39.688
meet Emma Bennett.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.190
Hi.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.066
How formal.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.193
I feel like I'm at
a débutante ball.

15:44.276 --> 15:48.405
Trust me, honey, we're
a long way from that.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.074
Take a seat, won't you?

15:53.619 --> 15:56.330
{\an3}I'm, uh, guessing
you'd mind if I smoked.

15:56.413 --> 15:59.500
Yeah, actually, I would.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.419
I figured that.

16:02.503 --> 16:06.048
It's a nasty habit,
lousy for the lungs.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.716
But you know, in a twisted way,

16:07.800 --> 16:10.010
that's part of the allure.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.428
You know that
little thrill you get

16:11.512 --> 16:12.846
when you know you're
doing something bad?

16:12.930 --> 16:14.682
Freud would have
a field day with you,

16:14.765 --> 16:16.850
wouldn't he?
He certainly would.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.936
(chuckling)

16:19.019 --> 16:20.729
Listen, uh, the
reason I called you

16:20.813 --> 16:22.564
and asked you to come
down here is because

16:22.648 --> 16:24.566
I wanted to offer you
a job here with us.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.610
{\an1}Now, I know you've
been doing some work

16:26.694 --> 16:27.736
for some other papers
and I certainly

16:27.820 --> 16:28.862
wouldn't stop you from...

16:28.946 --> 16:30.572
No.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.408
I beg your pardon?

16:32.491 --> 16:34.076
No, no commitments.

16:34.159 --> 16:37.371
{\an3}It's nothing personal,
it's just that

16:37.454 --> 16:39.081
monogamy cramps my style.

16:39.164 --> 16:43.377
I like to freelance, it
lets me be my own boss.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.879
All right then, why don't
you write an article for us

16:45.963 --> 16:48.298
and then we'll figure out what
the next step is from there?

16:48.382 --> 16:49.842
You cut right to the chase.

16:51.468 --> 16:53.303
No foreplay, nothing.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.596
I like that.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.600
Is that a yes?

16:58.684 --> 17:01.061
Why not?

17:01.145 --> 17:05.858
{\an3}You seem to understand
just what I need.

17:14.407 --> 17:17.994
(rock music playing)

17:26.044 --> 17:29.298

she keeps me guessing ♪

17:29.381 --> 17:32.259

17:54.573 --> 17:58.118
Hey, oh, I love what you've
done with the place.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.161
Standing room only.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.538
{\an3}Two more weeks of this
and even you'll go broke.

18:01.622 --> 18:02.623
{\an1}That's what I love
about you, Val.

18:02.706 --> 18:03.624
Your positive attitude.

18:03.707 --> 18:05.459
Don't leave home without it.

18:05.542 --> 18:06.668
(scoffs)

18:06.752 --> 18:08.670
Drink for the lady,
whatever she wants.

18:08.754 --> 18:09.922
{\an3}Uh, glass of
merlot, please.

18:11.715 --> 18:13.634
Uh, we're out of wine.

18:13.717 --> 18:15.469
The shipment never came in.
And what did you say

18:15.552 --> 18:17.638
{\an3}about not being
totally incompetent?

18:17.721 --> 18:18.806
If you want to talk
about the club,

18:18.889 --> 18:20.015
{\an1}we can talk...
I'm not here

18:20.098 --> 18:21.183
to talk about the club.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.060
I mean, the way it looks,
it looks like you're doing

18:23.143 --> 18:24.561
great business all by yourself.

18:24.645 --> 18:25.687
It's my first night.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.856
There is a learning curve
for everything, you know.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.025
So, where's your sidekick?

18:30.108 --> 18:30.901
Donna's photo shoot's
running late.

18:30.984 --> 18:32.069
She's not gonna be here.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.737
Well, I'm sure
she'll be pleased

18:33.821 --> 18:35.030
with your business skills.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.198
What's your point?

18:36.281 --> 18:39.243
Well, let's just call it
poetic justice.

18:39.326 --> 18:42.037
I mean, here you are, Mr. Laid
Back Party On the Boat Boy

18:42.120 --> 18:44.748
{\an3}now dealing with
constant inventories,

18:44.832 --> 18:47.376
{\an3}heinous accounting
and unreliable vendors.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.253
Not to mention
customers complaining

18:49.336 --> 18:51.338
about too much ice
in their drinks.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.674
Then again, what goes
around comes around.

18:53.757 --> 18:54.508
How's that?

18:54.591 --> 18:56.343
Well, I mean,
you were lying to me

18:56.426 --> 18:57.594
for months about who you were

18:57.678 --> 18:59.596
and then you go
and screw David over.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.265
Those things are gonna
come back and haunt you.

19:01.348 --> 19:03.100
It's a risk I'm gonna
have to deal with, huh?

19:03.183 --> 19:04.810
Well, knock yourself out.

19:04.893 --> 19:06.436
Looks like you're on your way

19:06.520 --> 19:08.188
to a brilliant future
as a club owner.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.076
{\an3}Hey.
Hey.

19:21.159 --> 19:22.077
You okay?

19:22.160 --> 19:24.413
Yeah, it's just
been a long day.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.248
I didn't think you got tired.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.500
You always seem ready
to take on one more patient.

19:28.584 --> 19:31.753
{\an3}Well, I don't like to turn
people away, you know?

19:31.837 --> 19:34.047
{\an1}Yeah, did you hurt
your shoulder?

19:34.131 --> 19:36.425
Yeah, it's a little stiff.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.594
{\an3}I think it's from filling out
all those insurance forms.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.971
{\an1}Come on, let me
take a look at it.

19:41.054 --> 19:42.931
I am the doctor, after all.

19:43.015 --> 19:43.765
{\an3}Okay.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.101
Why don't you have a seat?
Thanks.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.112
How's that?

19:57.195 --> 19:59.239
That feels great.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.453
Does that hurt?

20:04.536 --> 20:07.372
No, it doesn't hurt.

20:07.456 --> 20:08.999
But that's fine.

20:14.212 --> 20:16.632
How's that feel?

20:16.715 --> 20:19.092
It's much better.

20:22.721 --> 20:23.805
{\an1}Thanks.

20:23.889 --> 20:24.890
Anytime.

20:36.693 --> 20:39.112
(hard rock music blaring)

20:39.196 --> 20:42.866
(door opens and shuts)

20:42.950 --> 20:45.035
David, David!

20:45.118 --> 20:46.161
Can you lower the music?

20:46.244 --> 20:48.580
My head is pounding.

20:51.583 --> 20:52.960
(volume lowers)
Sorry.

20:53.043 --> 20:54.336
{\an1}Hey...

20:54.419 --> 20:55.837
shouldn't you be
with your boyfriend?

20:55.921 --> 20:57.839
{\an6}It's a big night for him.
I just got
done with work,

20:57.923 --> 21:00.968
and I have at least
two hours of stuff to do.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.302
He understood.

21:02.386 --> 21:03.637
Well, he's super understanding.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.013
Real prince, that guy.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.974
I'm not gonna have
this conversation.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.227
Sorry.

21:10.310 --> 21:13.063
Look, David...

21:13.146 --> 21:15.691
I'm sorry that this
is so hard for you.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.193
But Noah opened the door for
you to come back to the club.

21:18.276 --> 21:21.154
So you have no one to blame
for saying no except yourself.

21:29.579 --> 21:32.708
(music resumes blaring)

21:48.432 --> 21:49.516
What do you want?

21:49.599 --> 21:50.892
We need to talk.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.061
What if I don't want to?

21:53.145 --> 21:55.605
You're not making this easy.

21:55.689 --> 21:59.901
Well, from what I remember,
that's not how you liked it.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.069
This is strictly business.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.405
{\an1}Don't get the
wrong idea, okay?

22:03.488 --> 22:04.448
Go ahead.

22:04.531 --> 22:06.575
You were right about the club.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.702
I don't know the first
thing about running it.

22:08.785 --> 22:09.911
I need your help.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.747
{\an1}Especially with
day to day stuff.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.081
It'll cost you.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.709
Yeah, it always does
with you, Val, doesn't it?

22:15.792 --> 22:18.253
Look, I'll pay your old salary
plus 20% raise.

22:18.336 --> 22:20.589
{\an3}30% and I want
a cut of the profits

22:20.672 --> 22:23.133
{\an3}so one of these days
I can buy you out.

22:23.216 --> 22:24.760
What'd you have in mind?

22:24.843 --> 22:25.761
50%.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.554
You're nuts.

22:27.637 --> 22:29.264
You need me,
you said it yourself.

22:29.347 --> 22:31.558
Oh, need and desperation
are two different things.

22:32.684 --> 22:33.769
Ten percent.

22:33.852 --> 22:34.728
20.

22:34.811 --> 22:36.772
Ten. Take it or leave it.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.940
I'll take it.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.567
We got a deal.

22:48.742 --> 22:50.160
(door closing)

22:50.243 --> 22:51.536
(sighs)

22:51.620 --> 22:54.122
I'm telling you, Brandon,
it was unprofessional.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.500
Kel, you guys work together.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.293
He was probably just
being extra careful.

22:58.376 --> 23:01.588
I don't know, it's just...

23:01.671 --> 23:03.632
{\an3}What?

23:03.715 --> 23:05.008
It felt different.

23:05.092 --> 23:09.471
I mean, there's touching and
then there's <i> touching,</i> you know?

23:09.554 --> 23:13.558
Don't you think if he really
stepped over that line,

23:13.642 --> 23:14.810
you'd be sure?

23:14.893 --> 23:17.979
All I know
is that it-it didn't feel right.

23:18.063 --> 23:20.482
You're not used to being
examined by someone you know.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.692
It makes sense it would make
you feel a little uncomfortable.

23:22.776 --> 23:24.152
Why are you taking his side?

23:24.236 --> 23:25.445
I'm not taking his side,

23:25.529 --> 23:27.197
I'm just saying...

23:27.280 --> 23:29.324
{\an3}you've said so many
great things about him.

23:29.407 --> 23:33.120
I'm having a hard time imagining
someone so good being so bad.

23:33.203 --> 23:35.539
So, what? Y-You're saying
that I made this up?

23:35.622 --> 23:37.040
No.

23:37.124 --> 23:38.166
Then what are you saying?

23:38.250 --> 23:40.669
I'm saying maybe you just
got the wrong impression.

23:40.752 --> 23:43.046
{\an3}I mean, you didn't call
him on it, did you?

23:43.130 --> 23:44.506
No.

23:44.589 --> 23:45.674
{\an3}Exactly.

23:45.757 --> 23:48.218
{\an3}If he'd have been out of line,
you would've said something.

23:48.301 --> 23:50.053
It's not like you
to just sit there

23:50.137 --> 23:53.807
{\an3}and be made to feel
uncomfortable, right?

24:09.990 --> 24:11.700
{\an1}David, you're
forgetting the sleeve.

24:11.783 --> 24:14.035
{\an1}Remember? A flat sleeve
is a happy sleeve.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.912
Wonder what a depressed
sleeve would look like.

24:15.996 --> 24:17.873
{\an3}(chuckles)

24:17.956 --> 24:20.208
That was a joke.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.919
{\an1}Mm-hmm. I'm gonna go check
on that new shipment.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.296
You be all right up here?
Super.

24:25.463 --> 24:27.465
(rock music blaring
from headphones)

24:30.010 --> 24:32.262
Hey. Is that the
Frosted Flakes?

24:32.345 --> 24:34.222
{\an1}Yeah, yeah.
It's the new album.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.515
{\an3}Really?
How is it?

24:35.599 --> 24:36.600
{\an1}Oh, it's good.
You want a listen?

24:36.683 --> 24:39.019
Yeah, thanks.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.484
(Melissa clearing throat)

24:50.155 --> 24:51.740
{\an3}Thanks.

24:53.116 --> 24:54.409
Melissa, I was...

24:54.492 --> 24:55.619
Yeah. This isn't
a record store.

24:55.702 --> 24:58.246
You know, I can't believe
you're being so unprofessional.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.247
All I did...

24:59.331 --> 25:00.916
No, I know what you did.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.959
And I'm sick of your attitude.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.419
I want you to go
in back right now

25:04.502 --> 25:05.754
and start unpacking boxes.

25:05.837 --> 25:06.671
{\an1}Maybe that'll give you
an opportunity

25:06.755 --> 25:09.591
{\an1}to think about
how you're going to change.

25:12.510 --> 25:14.262
You know what?

25:14.346 --> 25:15.722
{\an3}I really don't need
that opportunity.

25:17.307 --> 25:18.558
Happy folding.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.107
{\an1}Can I borrow you
for a few minutes?

25:26.191 --> 25:27.651
{\an3}Sure. Yeah.

25:27.734 --> 25:29.611
{\an1}I feel like
I haven't seen you all day.

25:29.694 --> 25:31.238
Well, I've been busy.

25:31.321 --> 25:33.114
{\an1}Look, I know you've got
a lot of work to do,

25:33.198 --> 25:35.283
{\an1}but it's very important
for me to have you in the room

25:35.367 --> 25:36.785
when I conduct an exam.

25:36.868 --> 25:39.079
Okay. But why?

25:39.162 --> 25:41.623
Well, you just can't be
too careful these days.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.124
People are so litigious.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.876
I mean, one small
misunderstanding

25:44.960 --> 25:46.628
{\an1}and the next thing you know,
you're looking at charges

25:46.711 --> 25:48.880
{\an1}of impropriety
and sexual harassment.

25:50.715 --> 25:52.509
It's a sad world when you can't
even practice medicine

25:52.592 --> 25:54.761
without a witness in the room.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.063
(door slams)

26:11.611 --> 26:12.529
{\an1}Hi.

26:12.612 --> 26:13.989
Hey, you get
your article?

26:14.072 --> 26:15.657
Well, actually,

26:15.740 --> 26:17.033
that's why I'm here.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.619
{\an1}My computer sort of had
a nervous breakdown.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.288
{\an1}There's a geek
in my apartment right now

26:21.371 --> 26:23.498
trying to fix it,

26:23.581 --> 26:25.333
{\an1}but it probably won't
be ready till tomorrow.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.961
{\an3}No problem.

26:28.044 --> 26:30.297
{\an1}Well, I was thinking
maybe we could have a drink

26:30.380 --> 26:31.673
{\an1}and I could give it
to you in person.

26:31.756 --> 26:34.926
{\an3}That could probably
be arranged.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.886
{\an1}How about the Blue Turtle
tomorrow at 1:00?

26:36.970 --> 26:38.346
Sure.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.347
Great.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.141
{\an1}Well...

26:41.224 --> 26:43.977
{\an1}I would really love
to stay and schmooze,

26:44.060 --> 26:45.687
but I'm late for lunch.

26:45.770 --> 26:48.189
Seems like you always
got somewhere to go.

26:48.273 --> 26:49.691
Well, you know what they say.

26:49.774 --> 26:51.192
No, what do they say?

26:51.276 --> 26:55.030
A body in motion
stays in motion. See ya.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.670
{\an1}I'm so glad
we're gonna be alone.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.088
{\an1}(laughing)

27:12.172 --> 27:14.174
Zach won't be finished
with school until 4:00.

27:14.257 --> 27:15.550
{\an3}That gives us
four whole hours.

27:15.633 --> 27:17.677
Oh, four hours.
Hang the trapeze.

27:18.678 --> 27:19.721
Mom?

27:19.804 --> 27:20.889
{\an3}Carly!

27:20.972 --> 27:23.099
Oh, I thought... I thought
you were gonna be at work.

27:23.183 --> 27:26.436
I got off early.
What are you doing here?

27:26.519 --> 27:30.857
Um, well, the, uh, the
cable in my apartment

27:30.940 --> 27:32.567
{\an3}went out and so
we wanted to come

27:32.650 --> 27:35.403
{\an3}and see a
Preston Sturges movie.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.571
Oh, forgive me.

27:36.654 --> 27:40.533
{\an3}Chet, this is my daughter
Carly and her friend Steve.

27:40.617 --> 27:43.578
{\an3}And, um, this is
Chet Winslow, my...

27:44.496 --> 27:45.747
Significant other?

27:45.830 --> 27:46.915
{\an3}(giggles)

27:46.998 --> 27:48.208
Hi, Carly.

27:48.291 --> 27:49.876
{\an1}Hi, nice to meet you.
Steve.

27:49.959 --> 27:52.921
{\an5}Hello.
My mom has kept you
kind of a secret.

27:53.004 --> 27:56.091
{\an3}Well, I'm allowed to
have a private life, too.

27:56.174 --> 27:58.426
{\an3}But I guess it's
time it went public.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.428
{\an3}Chet has just
invited me to go

28:00.512 --> 28:02.806
{\an3}to his house in Arizona
for a few months.

28:02.889 --> 28:04.808
He's got a house
in the mountains.

28:04.891 --> 28:05.642
A few months?

28:05.725 --> 28:08.436
{\an1}I want your mom
to get to know my kids

28:08.520 --> 28:11.106
{\an3}and I thought we'd travel
a little, drive to Florida.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.941
{\an1}Maybe stop in one of those
towns, you know,

28:13.024 --> 28:13.942
that look like fun.

28:14.025 --> 28:15.985
{\an3}You know, I've always
wanted to see Graceland.

28:16.069 --> 28:18.446
Great.
That's great.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.448
{\an1}So um...

28:20.532 --> 28:21.449
when would you leave?

28:21.533 --> 28:23.118
Oh, I'm heading out this weekend

28:23.201 --> 28:24.786
for my grandson's birthday,

28:24.869 --> 28:27.997
and Doris will come next week.

28:28.081 --> 28:29.332
That's quick.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.000
{\an3}When it's the right thing,
you don't want to

28:31.084 --> 28:32.794
waste any time.

28:32.877 --> 28:35.422
But I'm going to miss
you, honey, and Zach.

28:35.505 --> 28:38.049
And I hope that you can find
another baby sitter.

28:50.061 --> 28:52.313
Hey.
Hey.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.816
Aren't you supposed
to be at work?

28:54.899 --> 28:58.111
My days at Khaki Nation
are over.

28:58.194 --> 29:00.488
What are you gonna do?

29:00.572 --> 29:04.033
Hmm. Find a job that doesn't
have anything to do

29:04.117 --> 29:05.201
with folding or, uh...

29:05.285 --> 29:07.328
company policy.

29:07.412 --> 29:10.665
I know, I have no one
to blame but myself.

29:10.748 --> 29:14.919
I'm sorry that I said that.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.839
Look, I know things are tough
for you right now.

29:17.922 --> 29:19.174
They are for me, too.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.134
{\an1}What, you have
a hair out of place?

29:21.217 --> 29:22.886
{\an1}David.
No I'm serious.

29:22.969 --> 29:26.014
{\an1}What, did you scuff a nail
or break a heel?

29:26.097 --> 29:29.309
Gosh, from where I'm sitting,
your life seems pretty great.

29:29.392 --> 29:30.810
Fine.

29:30.894 --> 29:34.481
You want to know
what's really bothering me?

29:34.564 --> 29:36.733
Please. Make my day.

29:36.816 --> 29:37.859
I've been thinking

29:37.942 --> 29:41.196
that maybe it was a mistake
that we slept together.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.034
You know what?
I don't want to hear this.

29:46.117 --> 29:47.869
I thought we were going
to get married.

29:47.952 --> 29:50.538
{\an3}And look.

29:50.622 --> 29:51.831
We're not even together anymore.

29:51.915 --> 29:52.832
{\an1}Donna...

29:52.916 --> 29:54.250
that was your decision.

29:54.334 --> 29:55.418
I was fine waiting.

29:55.502 --> 29:57.378
Hell, I'd already
waited seven years!

29:57.462 --> 29:59.339
I'm not saying
that it wasn't my decision.

29:59.422 --> 30:01.716
This doesn't even
sound like you.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.178
You know, I'm-I'm listening
to what you're saying,

30:05.261 --> 30:07.722
but I'm not sure if these words
are yours or your mother's.

30:07.805 --> 30:08.890
They're mine.

30:08.973 --> 30:10.016
Are you sure?

30:10.099 --> 30:11.351
You know what? Forget it.

30:11.434 --> 30:13.228
I thought that I could
talk to you about this,

30:13.311 --> 30:15.063
that you could listen to me,

30:15.146 --> 30:17.065
{\an3}that maybe you
could be my friend.

30:17.148 --> 30:19.108
{\an1}You know what? I'm sorry.
I want more than that.

30:19.192 --> 30:21.069
{\an1}I still love you. That's why
I can't help you out

30:21.152 --> 30:22.362
{\an1}with this whole
thing, all right?

30:22.445 --> 30:24.280
Because it-it hurts me too much.

30:24.364 --> 30:26.241
{\an3}I'm sorry.

30:27.992 --> 30:30.119
So am I.

30:35.166 --> 30:37.210
(door slamming)

30:42.882 --> 30:44.759
{\an3}Okay, we have Disco Night,
Grunge Night,

30:44.842 --> 30:48.596
{\an3}Comedy Night, Country and
Western Night, '50s Night...

30:48.680 --> 30:49.973
Country and Western Night?

30:50.056 --> 30:50.932
Oh, a lot of people like it.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.767
You one of them?

30:52.850 --> 30:55.937
{\an3}No, but we should give it
a try before we blow it off.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.731
Hey, you've put a lot of hard
work into this, haven't you?

30:58.815 --> 31:01.693
{\an3}I told you, the club means
a lot to me, it's important.

31:01.776 --> 31:03.403
Yeah, I know. It's just...

31:03.486 --> 31:05.905
Why are you so surprised?

31:05.989 --> 31:08.283
I've just never seen
this side of you before.

31:08.366 --> 31:10.243
Now you have.

31:10.326 --> 31:12.287
Look, I want to thank you.

31:12.370 --> 31:13.955
{\an3}It means a lot
to me being here.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.623
It's okay.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.000
I'm just glad you're happy.

31:28.553 --> 31:31.472
Oh! Ten bucks says you're
gonna go see my partner.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.600
What?

31:33.683 --> 31:34.809
Noah didn't tell you?

31:34.892 --> 31:36.603
He asked me to come back to
the club and work with him.

31:36.686 --> 31:38.104
No.

31:38.187 --> 31:40.523
Well, don't worry.
It's just business.

31:40.607 --> 31:42.692
{\an3}You can have him all to
yourself after hours.

31:44.527 --> 31:46.321
NAT: Hey, can I
get you anything

31:46.404 --> 31:47.238
else, darling?

31:47.322 --> 31:49.490
{\an3}No, I have everything
I need, thanks.

31:49.574 --> 31:50.867
Cool.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.505
♪ No one knows ♪

32:04.589 --> 32:08.426
♪ How the story goes ♪

32:09.844 --> 32:11.846
♪ Till the end... ♪

32:11.929 --> 32:13.389
Right on time.

32:13.473 --> 32:15.141
Did you hire Valerie as
your business partner?

32:15.224 --> 32:16.351
{\an3}Did you?

32:16.434 --> 32:17.852
{\an1}I made her
an employee. Why?

32:17.935 --> 32:21.022
Why? What were you thinking?

32:21.105 --> 32:23.399
{\an3}You, of all people, should
know what she's like.

32:23.483 --> 32:25.401
I don't know how to run a club.
She's good at it.

32:25.485 --> 32:28.029
{\an3}I'm not talking about
her business sense.

32:28.112 --> 32:29.822
{\an3}It's the fact that
she lies, she cheats,

32:29.906 --> 32:31.407
she basically uses people.

32:31.491 --> 32:33.743
{\an1}Look, it's not personal.
It's business, okay?

32:33.826 --> 32:36.120
{\an3}Working with an old
girlfriend is always personal.

32:36.204 --> 32:38.039
{\an1}So is asking your ex-boyfriend
to move in with you.

32:38.122 --> 32:39.832
That is completely different.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.751
{\an3}David had no place to
live and it's temporary.

32:41.834 --> 32:43.252
{\an3}It's not like I'm
seeing him all day long.

32:43.336 --> 32:44.837
{\an1}Look, I'm gonna
spend as little time

32:44.921 --> 32:46.047
{\an1}with her as possible,
all right?

32:46.130 --> 32:49.217
You could have hired so many
people. Why did you pick her?

32:49.300 --> 32:51.719
{\an1}Because she knows this place
inside and out.

32:51.803 --> 32:52.970
And she needed a job.

32:53.054 --> 32:55.932
I don't believe this.

32:56.015 --> 32:57.558
Valerie is not helpless.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.227
{\an3}You know, first she
pulls one over on David

32:59.310 --> 33:00.812
{\an3}and now she's doing
the same thing to you.

33:00.895 --> 33:03.064
{\an1}Look, I told you,
I have my eyes wide open.

33:03.147 --> 33:04.565
I don't want this
to ruin our night.

33:06.484 --> 33:07.735
I was hoping we could go get

33:07.819 --> 33:09.195
some sushi and catch
a movie tonight.

33:09.278 --> 33:11.072
I can't.

33:11.155 --> 33:12.240
Work?

33:12.323 --> 33:14.367
Noah, I'm not about

33:14.450 --> 33:15.743
to get into a relationship

33:15.827 --> 33:18.579
and have Valerie
barking at my heels again.

33:18.663 --> 33:19.914
I just can't do it.

33:19.997 --> 33:21.874
Are you pushing me away
because of Valerie,

33:21.958 --> 33:23.751
or because your mom
doesn't approve of me?

33:23.835 --> 33:25.753
My mother doesn't want
to see me get hurt.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.088
Neither do I.

33:27.171 --> 33:28.881
Does Valerie
still have a job here?

33:28.965 --> 33:30.091
Look, I made a deal.

33:30.174 --> 33:32.093
I-I can't go back on my word.

33:32.176 --> 33:32.927
I guess not.

33:33.010 --> 33:34.178
{\an1}Donna, we had something
really nice

33:34.262 --> 33:37.056
going here. I don't want to see
it get ruined because of this.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.933
I need...

33:39.016 --> 33:42.145
(voice breaking): I need some
time to see how I feel.

33:43.521 --> 33:46.107
I guess I'll give you a call
when I figure it out.

33:59.746 --> 34:00.788
So, tell me about Emma.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.791
Is she as funny in person
as she is in her columns?

34:03.875 --> 34:06.502
Yeah, yeah, she's, uh,
she's got a good sense of humor.

34:06.586 --> 34:08.087
Yeah? Well,
you should tell her

34:08.170 --> 34:10.590
that we would like
to have her over for dinner.

34:10.672 --> 34:12.842
{\an4}Great, sounds
like a plan.
Good.

34:12.925 --> 34:14.135
Oh, Brandon.

34:14.217 --> 34:16.262
About Dr. Monahan,

34:16.344 --> 34:18.806
I think I overreacted.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.808
Are you sure?
Yeah.

34:20.891 --> 34:21.976
He's always really careful

34:22.059 --> 34:24.603
about having me in the room
when he does examinations,

34:24.687 --> 34:26.606
so that women
don't get the wrong idea.

34:26.688 --> 34:28.608
Well, that's pretty considerate.

34:28.690 --> 34:30.777
Yeah. I think
that you were right.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.277
Maybe I was just uncomfortable

34:32.360 --> 34:34.614
having someone I know
examine me.

34:34.697 --> 34:37.617
Well, I'm glad you're feeling
better about everything.

34:37.699 --> 34:39.327
Thank you for your support.

34:39.409 --> 34:41.204
You're welcome.
My pleasure.

34:43.121 --> 34:45.373
I'm sorry... I'm so antsy.

34:45.458 --> 34:48.127
{\an3}I just can't stop
thinking about my mom.

34:48.210 --> 34:50.420
Yeah, well, she didn't
give you much notice.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.799
(sighs)
Y-You know, the truth is,

34:52.882 --> 34:55.802
is I'm a... I'm actually really
happy that she's found someone.

34:55.885 --> 34:58.221
I mean, she's
been alone a long time.

34:58.304 --> 35:00.223
I just...

35:00.306 --> 35:03.142
I just wish she would have
found him after Christmas.

35:03.226 --> 35:05.394
{\an3}Or Zach's
school vacation.

35:05.478 --> 35:08.481
{\an4}(sighs):
You know, it's been
hard enough as it is

35:08.564 --> 35:09.899
with her helping out.

35:09.982 --> 35:12.902
{\an3}I have no idea what I'm
gonna do without her.

35:12.985 --> 35:14.070
Well...

35:14.153 --> 35:16.197
{\an1}we'll work something
out, don't worry.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.323
We?

35:17.406 --> 35:18.241
Yeah, we.

35:18.324 --> 35:21.077
I'm not gonna let you
go through this alone.

35:21.160 --> 35:23.079
{\an3}(sighs)
Come here.

35:24.497 --> 35:26.624
{\an3}I'm so happy I have
you in my life.

35:28.251 --> 35:29.627
Me, too.

35:30.628 --> 35:32.046
(laughs)

35:32.129 --> 35:34.048
What's so funny?

35:34.132 --> 35:35.675
Well, Zach's at school, right?

35:35.758 --> 35:37.009
Yeah.
And...

35:37.093 --> 35:41.097
{\an3}my mom's packing
for Arizona...

35:42.473 --> 35:44.058
We're alone.
Uh-huh.

35:44.141 --> 35:47.520
We've spent all this time trying
to find time alone together,

35:47.603 --> 35:49.230
and... now that we have it,

35:49.313 --> 35:51.566
{\an3}we're not even making
the most of it.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.609
What do you suggest
we do about it?

35:53.693 --> 35:55.611
Well...

35:55.695 --> 35:57.738
this, for a start.

36:02.493 --> 36:05.746
Ooh, I like the way you think.

36:10.334 --> 36:11.586
Well...

36:11.669 --> 36:13.087
here's the article.

36:13.170 --> 36:14.505
Sorry for the delay.

36:14.589 --> 36:16.424
How is it?
Fabulous.

36:16.507 --> 36:18.092
They're always fabulous.

36:18.175 --> 36:21.178
{\an1}Well, here's to you
being fabulous.

36:25.349 --> 36:29.270
{\an3}So... tell me about
the real Brandon Walsh.

36:29.353 --> 36:32.565
What you see is what you get.

36:32.648 --> 36:34.108
{\an3}Well, it's been
my experience

36:34.192 --> 36:36.277
that appearances are
usually misleading.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.945
Not much to tell, really.

36:38.029 --> 36:41.782
I was born in Minnesota,
raised in Beverly Hills.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.242
But why the <i> Beverly Beat?</i>

36:43.326 --> 36:45.578
{\an3}I mean, there's a whole
big world out there.

36:45.661 --> 36:47.330
That's a long story.

36:47.413 --> 36:48.998
I've got all day.

36:49.081 --> 36:52.585
And what happened
to being a body in motion?

36:54.045 --> 36:57.298
Sometimes a body
likes where it is.

37:02.261 --> 37:05.806
I'm really sorry Khaki
Nation didn't work out.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.808
(chuckles):
Don't be.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.310
It was killing me.

37:09.393 --> 37:11.520
{\an1}Besides, I got a new job--
starting tomorrow,

37:11.604 --> 37:14.440
I'll be the newest
employee at, uh...

37:14.523 --> 37:16.025
Ralph's Car Wash.

37:16.108 --> 37:17.151
No.

37:17.234 --> 37:18.235
Yep.

37:18.319 --> 37:21.280
{\an1}The money's actually not
too bad, and I was desperate.

37:21.364 --> 37:23.324
{\an3}(laughs): You know, this
is Noah's fault.

37:23.407 --> 37:24.617
He screwed everything up.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.577
{\an4}Yeah, you can
say that again.
(sighs)

37:26.661 --> 37:27.870
DONNA:
David?

37:27.954 --> 37:29.205
{\an3}Hey.
Hey, I...

37:29.288 --> 37:30.831
I thought it
was you guys.

37:30.915 --> 37:32.333
{\an3}Uh, what are
you up to?

37:32.416 --> 37:33.793
Shopping.
Hanging out.

37:33.876 --> 37:36.337
{\an3}Maybe you should get
your stories straight.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.130
Yeah, I guess we should.

37:38.214 --> 37:41.467
{\an3}Anyway, I'm off to see
my mom at the boat.

37:41.550 --> 37:44.220
{\an3}I'll... see you
later, David.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.305
Bye.

37:46.389 --> 37:50.518
Did you see the look on her face
when she saw us together?

37:50.601 --> 37:52.561
Yeah, she wasn't too happy.

37:52.645 --> 37:55.982
{\an3}Are you kidding?
She was livid.

37:56.065 --> 37:59.777
{\an3}Which gives me the answer
to all our problems.

38:00.778 --> 38:02.655
Val, what are you thinking?

38:02.738 --> 38:04.740
Hanging out together,
like Donna and Noah.

38:04.824 --> 38:07.576
{\an6}(fake retch)
Okay, you know what,
it makes me sick, too.

38:07.660 --> 38:10.538
But if she thinks and if Noah
thinks that we're, you know...

38:10.621 --> 38:12.081
{\an1}No, no. They'll
never buy it.

38:12.164 --> 38:13.290
{\an3}Why not?
We dated before.

38:13.374 --> 38:16.210
{\an5}You know how long
ago that was?
You are so negative.

38:16.293 --> 38:17.878
Val, I'm realistic.

38:17.962 --> 38:20.881
{\an3}Would you just
give this a try?

38:20.965 --> 38:22.383
{\an1}Okay, you're-you're
telling me that

38:22.466 --> 38:25.553
{\an1}if we pretend to be a couple,
they'll get so jealous

38:25.636 --> 38:28.222
that they'll break up
and come back to us?

38:28.306 --> 38:30.391
{\an3}Trust me,
it's gonna work.

38:34.645 --> 38:37.023
Okay. Fine, fine,
it's worth a shot.

38:37.106 --> 38:38.774
{\an3}Okay.

38:42.653 --> 38:43.904
Ooh, I'm sorry.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.239
Not at all.

38:45.322 --> 38:47.283
I just hope I didn't
hurt that shoulder.

38:47.366 --> 38:48.784
No, it's much better.

38:48.868 --> 38:50.411
{\an1}Thank you.

38:50.494 --> 38:53.080
In case I haven't
told you, Kelly,

38:53.164 --> 38:55.875
{\an1}you look very
beautiful today.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.595
{\an1}We've had many wonderful
times on that boat.

39:07.678 --> 39:08.763
It's been fabulous.

39:08.846 --> 39:10.598
Oh, it's a lovely boat.
Thank you.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.433
Oh, excuse me.

39:12.516 --> 39:13.768
Honey, you made it.

39:13.851 --> 39:16.062
{\an3}I wouldn't let you go
through this alone.

39:16.145 --> 39:17.271
Oh, thank you.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.608
You know, I really am
very proud of you.

39:20.691 --> 39:22.943
You've grown
into quite a young woman.

39:23.027 --> 39:25.404
{\an3}Thank you. And, Mom,
about the other day...

39:25.488 --> 39:27.031
No, no.

39:27.114 --> 39:29.450
You said it:
you're an adult now.

39:29.533 --> 39:31.118
{\an1}You're gonna make
all your own decisions.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.286
I respect that.

39:32.369 --> 39:34.080
But I am still your mother.

39:34.163 --> 39:37.458
{\an1}So when you get
hurt, I get hurt.

39:37.541 --> 39:38.793
{\an3}BARKER:
Are you ready?

39:38.876 --> 39:40.461
As ready as I'll ever be.

39:40.544 --> 39:41.921
Let's go.

39:46.258 --> 39:47.968
(gavel banging)

39:48.052 --> 39:50.971
Please take your seats.

39:51.055 --> 39:53.682
We'll get started
in just a moment.

39:53.766 --> 39:55.101
Thank you.

39:55.184 --> 39:56.811
We'll start the bidding

39:56.894 --> 39:58.604
on this beautiful
sloop at $200,000.

39:58.687 --> 40:00.481
Do I hear $200,000?

40:00.564 --> 40:03.025
{\an4}$200,000.
$200,000.
Looking for $250,000.

40:03.109 --> 40:05.069
{\an1}Do I hear $250,000?
$250,000.

40:05.152 --> 40:06.445
{\an1}$250,000.
Thank you.

40:06.529 --> 40:07.446
$275,000.

40:07.530 --> 40:08.781
$275,000. Thank you, sir.

40:08.864 --> 40:11.367
Do I hear $300,000?
Looking for $300,000.

40:11.450 --> 40:13.077
{\an4}$300,000.
$300,000.
Thank you, sir.

40:13.160 --> 40:14.954
Looking for $325,000.
I have $300,000.

40:15.037 --> 40:16.497
{\an1}Looking
for $325,000.

40:16.580 --> 40:17.706
$300,000 going once,

40:17.790 --> 40:20.000
{\an1}$300,000 twice...
$325,000.

40:20.084 --> 40:22.044
(indistinct chatter)

40:23.254 --> 40:24.547
$325,000, sir.

40:24.630 --> 40:26.132
That's not funny, young man.

40:26.215 --> 40:27.842
I didn't intend
for it to be funny.

40:27.925 --> 40:30.219
Excuse me, I'm sorry
for the interruption.

40:30.302 --> 40:32.346
I believe the final bid was...

40:32.429 --> 40:34.723
$325,000.

40:35.975 --> 40:38.018
Does he think this is a joke?

40:39.812 --> 40:42.481
No. Actually, he's serious.

40:42.565 --> 40:43.649
{\an1}FELICE:
Well, I don't think

40:43.732 --> 40:45.192
you have that
kind of money.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.026
You're right,
Mrs. Martin,

40:46.110 --> 40:48.070
I don't have it all
on me right now.

40:48.154 --> 40:50.990
But what I do have is
a cashier's check for $300,000.

40:51.073 --> 40:52.950
That pretty much shows
I'm good for the rest.

40:55.870 --> 40:58.330
We have $325,000.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.709
$325,000 is the bid.

41:01.792 --> 41:04.044
Going once,
going twice...

41:04.128 --> 41:05.045
(bangs gavel)

41:05.129 --> 41:07.548
Sold to Mr. Noah Hunter.

41:09.133 --> 41:10.134
{\an1}FELICE:
Hunter Oil &amp;

41:10.217 --> 41:13.053
{\an3}Chemic... You're one
of <i> those</i> Hunters?

41:13.137 --> 41:14.388
We all have our flaws.

41:15.764 --> 41:17.725
Did you know about this?

41:17.808 --> 41:18.893
Yup.

41:18.976 --> 41:20.728
Why didn't you tell me?

41:20.811 --> 41:24.607
{\an1}Because I knew you'd
treat him differently.

41:24.690 --> 41:26.025
A second?

41:26.108 --> 41:28.110
Sure.

41:29.486 --> 41:31.864
I-I'm sorry.

41:31.947 --> 41:34.408
{\an3}I needed a place to live;
that's why I came here.

41:34.491 --> 41:39.079
You said you wanted some time,
and I want to give it to you.

41:39.163 --> 41:41.040
Okay.

41:41.999 --> 41:44.251
There, I took it.

41:44.335 --> 41:46.253
So, what'd you
come up with?

41:46.337 --> 41:48.589
{\an1}That I'd like
to keep seeing you.

41:48.672 --> 41:50.216
I'm glad.

41:59.058 --> 42:01.060
Did you ask Emma to dinner?

42:01.143 --> 42:03.437
{\an3}No, no, it didn't...
it didn't come up.

42:03.520 --> 42:04.939
All work and no play...

42:05.022 --> 42:06.357
Yeah, I know, I know.

42:06.440 --> 42:07.608
Next time, I promise.

42:07.691 --> 42:10.110
I'm gonna take a quick shower.

42:10.194 --> 42:11.904
You okay?

42:11.987 --> 42:15.074
Yeah, I just feel kind of dirty.

42:15.157 --> 42:16.784
Look, Kel...

42:16.867 --> 42:17.868
I'm fine.

42:19.203 --> 42:21.372
I'll just be a minute.

42:26.543 --> 42:29.171
(phone rings)

42:29.255 --> 42:30.297
Yeah?

42:30.381 --> 42:31.590
EMMA:
Hi, Brandon.

42:31.674 --> 42:32.758
It's Emma.

42:32.841 --> 42:33.926
Is it too late?

42:34.009 --> 42:35.261
Are you in bed?

42:35.344 --> 42:38.180
No, it's not too late;
yes, I am in bed.

42:38.264 --> 42:39.848
If you're calling about
your article, don't worry,

42:39.932 --> 42:41.308
I printed it word-for-word;
it was great.

42:41.392 --> 42:43.269
It wasn't too cerebral?

42:43.352 --> 42:45.771
No, no, no, not at all,
it was great.

42:45.854 --> 42:46.772
One more thing.

42:46.855 --> 42:48.774
What are you wearing?

42:48.857 --> 42:50.109
Excuse me?

42:50.192 --> 42:54.280
I'm wearing a black slip
with lace trim.

42:54.363 --> 42:56.532
Charming.

42:56.615 --> 42:58.659
Actually, it's pretty sexy.

42:58.742 --> 43:00.828
I'm sure it is.

43:00.911 --> 43:03.038
Do you want to come over
and find out?

43:04.081 --> 43:05.749
I can't.

43:06.750 --> 43:08.627
You will.

43:15.217 --> 43:17.386
Who was on the phone?

43:18.762 --> 43:21.390
It was a wrong number.
