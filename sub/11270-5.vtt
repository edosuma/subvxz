00:05.920 --> 00:07.960
Coach, how about a beer?

00:08.089 --> 00:12.503
Sam says I can't serve you.
You're a flimflam.

00:12.636 --> 00:16.801
It ain't for me, it's for a friend.
He asked me to order it for him.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.552
He did.

00:19.686 --> 00:23.270
He wrote it down. "One beer."

00:23.399 --> 00:28.525
Wait one minute, Harry.
Let me see that.

00:28.655 --> 00:33.318
"One beer." Just had to make sure.

00:34.621 --> 00:36.329
That'll be one buck.

00:36.456 --> 00:41.618
I thought I had a dollar.
I got a ten. You got change?

00:41.754 --> 00:44.127
Absolutely.

00:47.428 --> 00:48.839
Here you go.

00:48.971 --> 00:56.138
I have a buck after all. I don't
need change. Give me my ten back.

00:56.313 --> 00:59.065
Right.

01:01.611 --> 01:03.022
Here you go.

01:03.155 --> 01:09.526
I don't want to carry all these
bills. Give me a 20 for the lot.

01:10.497 --> 01:12.454
You got it.

01:13.459 --> 01:14.657
Nobody move!

01:16.879 --> 01:20.130
Coach, don't you see
he's short-changing you?

01:20.258 --> 01:24.588
No. He's outsmarted me before,
but not this time.

01:24.722 --> 01:26.466
How much are you giving him?

01:26.599 --> 01:29.933
- 20 bucks.
- How much is he giving you?

01:30.062 --> 01:31.853
Darn you, Harry!

01:32.857 --> 01:36.357
Sam, I'm just trying
to keep in practice.

01:36.486 --> 01:38.693
I'll give you a $30 bill,
and we're even.

01:38.822 --> 01:39.818
What do you think?

01:39.948 --> 01:43.069
- No such thing as a $30 bill.
- Wanna bet?

01:44.454 --> 01:45.865
Get out of my bar!

01:45.997 --> 01:48.868
You owe me $10! Is this a clip joint?

01:49.001 --> 01:50.412
I'm sorry. Here.

01:50.544 --> 01:53.250
You got the wrong idea about me.

01:53.381 --> 01:57.795
I don't. You got ten seconds
to get out. Give me back my watch!

01:57.928 --> 02:01.761
I'm trying to help you guys out.
If you wanna upgrade...

02:01.891 --> 02:04.347
Out!

02:06.000 --> 02:12.074

03:17.439 --> 03:20.357
- Afternoon.
- Hey, Norm!

03:20.818 --> 03:22.811
Gimme a beer, will you?

03:22.946 --> 03:26.896
- How's life treating you?
- Like I just ran over its dog.

03:28.202 --> 03:29.994
You're late. How come?

03:30.955 --> 03:34.574
Vera dragged me to the mortuary
to arrange our funeral.

03:34.710 --> 03:36.916
Thinking of dying, Norm?

03:37.046 --> 03:42.468
No date circled yet,
but... Vera likes to plan ahead.

03:42.594 --> 03:45.382
We're gonna get cremated.

03:45.890 --> 03:48.179
What'll you do with the ashes?

03:48.935 --> 03:51.391
I wanted to throw them
in her mother's face,

03:51.521 --> 03:56.433
but I think we'll scatter them
on the Adirondacks.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.240
- Hello, everyone!
- Hi, Diane!

04:03.369 --> 04:06.869
Sorry I'm late, but you'll be
delighted when you hear why.

04:06.998 --> 04:09.536
We were delighted you were late!

04:10.711 --> 04:15.919
I had a fabulous discussion
with my art history professor.

04:16.050 --> 04:21.637
I now feel I have
a full grasp of lmpressionism.

04:21.766 --> 04:23.260
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:23.392 --> 04:26.596
Do Kirk Douglas!

04:28.982 --> 04:30.940
Sam, I'm sorry I was late.

04:31.068 --> 04:33.108
Can I do anything
to make it up to you?

04:33.571 --> 04:35.481
Yeah... but you wouldn't.

04:40.746 --> 04:42.574
Cheers. Yeah.

04:42.707 --> 04:44.367
Coach, your friend Walt.

04:44.501 --> 04:46.957
Walt?

04:47.087 --> 04:53.803
It's good to hear from you!
I'm so glad the operation's over.

04:53.929 --> 05:01.178
I didn't tell you beforehand, but I
didn't think your chances were good.

05:01.646 --> 05:04.054
It's tomorrow?

05:06.235 --> 05:12.440
Don't worry, you'll fly through it.
It's a piece of cake.

05:12.993 --> 05:15.319
Hello, everybody.

05:15.454 --> 05:17.697
The famous sportscaster!

05:17.874 --> 05:20.116
- Hi, Coach!
- Right on, man!

05:20.252 --> 05:23.170
We watch you on the news every night.

05:23.297 --> 05:25.124
Best sports report in town.

05:26.175 --> 05:28.749
What do we have here? Hi.

05:28.887 --> 05:31.675
Dave Richards,
an old team-mate of Sam's.

05:31.807 --> 05:36.055
Diane Chambers.
I'm Sam's new waitress.

05:36.187 --> 05:37.812
Sam have his brand on you yet?

05:37.939 --> 05:39.564
Hardly.

05:39.691 --> 05:41.850
Then it's your lucky day.

05:41.986 --> 05:45.771
I'm incredibly good-looking,
incredibly rich and incredibly nice.

05:45.907 --> 05:48.363
And incredibly married!

05:50.788 --> 05:53.077
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- You are?

05:53.207 --> 05:58.333
Yes. I'd hoped to reject you
based solely on your personality.

06:04.387 --> 06:06.345
Too skinny.

06:06.473 --> 06:08.217
Can I have Coach buy you a beer?

06:08.350 --> 06:11.056
- No, I'm here on business.
- I noticed.

06:13.565 --> 06:16.650
How would you like to be
my interview on the news tonight?

06:16.777 --> 06:18.569
That's terrific!

06:18.696 --> 06:22.611
Interview me?
I haven't been in baseball for years.

06:22.743 --> 06:27.286
I understand. You're the best
reliever the Red Sox ever had.

06:27.415 --> 06:30.167
You're still a big name in this town.

06:30.293 --> 06:34.837
- We can do it here in the bar.
- You can't ask for more than that.

06:34.965 --> 06:38.133
And besides, you owe me a favour.

06:38.261 --> 06:39.921
- I do?
- Yeah.

06:40.055 --> 06:43.092
That night in Chicago in 1 973,
with those two young...

06:43.225 --> 06:45.847
...dollars I borrowed? Yeah.

06:45.978 --> 06:48.055
Two young dollars?

06:48.189 --> 06:50.266
Yeah, I hate it
when they're wrinkled.

06:52.695 --> 06:56.111
I'm out of practice.
It's years since I did an interview.

06:56.241 --> 06:59.776
Come on, Sam. It's good advertising.
It would help business.

06:59.912 --> 07:04.539
Right. And we can all be on TV.
I'd like to see myself on TV.

07:04.667 --> 07:09.081
No, you wouldn't. Trust me.
Trust me on that.

07:10.007 --> 07:11.834
Come on. I haven't got all day.

07:11.968 --> 07:13.759
Yeah, come on!

07:15.889 --> 07:18.511
Everybody here
wants you to do the interview.

07:18.642 --> 07:20.682
Almost everybody.

07:22.272 --> 07:24.099
What do you mean?

07:25.067 --> 07:26.229
Never mind.

07:27.194 --> 07:32.190
Excuse me. Diane,
can I talk to you in the back room?

07:32.325 --> 07:34.947
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

07:35.078 --> 07:38.530
I'll be right back.
I have to discipline an employee.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.624
- Can I watch?
- No!

07:42.546 --> 07:45.215
OK, what's the problem?

07:45.341 --> 07:47.499
Why do you think I have a problem?

07:47.635 --> 07:50.387
You've got that "Sam's a chowderhead

07:50.513 --> 07:53.515
and wouldn't understand
if I drew him a picture" look.

07:55.061 --> 07:57.386
I do get that sometimes.

07:58.106 --> 08:03.267
Sam, you're an ex-jockstrap...

08:03.404 --> 08:05.563
Ex-jock.

08:07.075 --> 08:10.409
That's ex-jock!
How many times I gotta tell you that?

08:11.080 --> 08:13.203
What is the origin of the word jock?

08:13.332 --> 08:17.497
I... From the French. Jacques.

08:18.505 --> 08:25.505
Those "Where are they now?"
interviews on TV are depressing.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.925
Any time you put a "former"
in front of a name,

08:29.059 --> 08:32.844
even the most attractive,
bright guy...

08:32.981 --> 08:34.523
Excuse me. Attractive?

08:34.649 --> 08:36.274
Yeah. Even then...

08:36.400 --> 08:39.154
I didn't know
you thought I was attractive.

08:39.280 --> 08:43.907
Well, when the light
strikes you in a certain way,

08:44.034 --> 08:49.244
and your hair's combed just right,
and I'm standing back a ways,

08:49.375 --> 08:53.243
you're sometimes
somewhat unrepugnant.

08:55.132 --> 09:00.008
Yeah, that's what women call me.
Tall, dark and unrepugnant!

09:00.138 --> 09:02.808
The point I'm labouring to make here

09:02.933 --> 09:08.390
is that when I see an old athlete
reliving his glory days on TV,

09:08.523 --> 09:11.145
I can't help but feel sorry for him.

09:11.276 --> 09:15.061
- I don't want to feel sorry for you.
- Feel sorry for me?

09:15.197 --> 09:18.068
I resent that.
You don't have to feel sorry for me.

09:18.201 --> 09:21.736
You know
who you should feel sorry for?

09:21.872 --> 09:25.039
You should feel sorry
for the Flintstones!

09:29.464 --> 09:30.923
I beg your pardon?

09:31.050 --> 09:33.339
They're opposite
the six o'clock news,

09:33.469 --> 09:35.877
and when people find out
Mayday Malone is on,

09:36.014 --> 09:39.466
Bedrock is gonna be
a very lonely little town!

09:42.063 --> 09:45.017
Martina Navra... No.

09:45.150 --> 09:48.733
Martina Denavramammajamma... No.

09:49.238 --> 09:51.361
Dave, let's do it!

09:55.120 --> 09:58.869
Great. Give me 20 minutes.
I'll bring the crew right back.

09:58.999 --> 10:03.080
You got it. It'll give me time
to slip into my shawl and blanket!

10:03.213 --> 10:07.710
- Dave, this is a really good idea.
- Yeah, it's pretty good, isn't it?

10:07.843 --> 10:10.335
About time you got around to Mayday.

10:11.306 --> 10:15.684
I'm really excited
that he agreed to do the interview.

10:15.811 --> 10:18.481
John McEnroe cancelled out on me.

10:18.606 --> 10:20.682
So Sam was your second choice?

10:20.817 --> 10:23.522
No. Gerry Cheever's
out of town with his horses.

10:23.654 --> 10:26.940
- Third?
- ML Carr has laryngitis.

10:27.074 --> 10:28.569
Fourth?

10:28.701 --> 10:32.403
Jim Rice is out of town,
Robert Parish was last week.

10:32.539 --> 10:36.123
And Becky Bannerman, the high
school gymnast, is on a field trip.

10:37.211 --> 10:40.711
But Sam was the first retired guy
you thought of?

10:40.841 --> 10:41.837
No. Well...

10:41.967 --> 10:47.211
I said, Sam was the first
retired guy you thought of!

10:47.348 --> 10:49.674
- The very first.
- He's honoured.

11:10.418 --> 11:14.582
The Celtics got going pretty good,
eh?

11:15.340 --> 11:18.295
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

11:18.427 --> 11:21.263
I'm practising
my floating coin trick.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.298
Pardon me?

11:25.602 --> 11:27.227
Just a little something I do.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.347
So it's a rigged-up coin?

11:29.482 --> 11:32.602
No, it's just a half-dollar. Look.

11:32.944 --> 11:36.812
It's a trick, right?
Strings, wires and stuff?

11:36.949 --> 11:39.108
No wires, no strings.
I take the coin.

11:39.243 --> 11:42.245
I hold it in the air,
about like that.

11:42.372 --> 11:44.661
I let go of it real careful,

11:44.792 --> 11:47.877
and it just stays there, it floats.

11:49.088 --> 11:50.797
It hangs there.

11:51.341 --> 11:53.797
What am I, a goof?

11:53.928 --> 11:56.384
There's no way you can do it!

11:56.514 --> 11:58.554
You got five bucks if I can't do it?

11:58.683 --> 12:00.094
Ten! Ten bucks.

12:00.227 --> 12:02.267
Wait. Am I being hustled?

12:02.396 --> 12:06.477
You are gonna give me ten bucks
if I cannot do it?

12:06.609 --> 12:08.567
You're onsville, pal! Come on.

12:16.204 --> 12:18.244
- I couldn't do it!
- No, you couldn't!

12:18.373 --> 12:20.413
- What happened?
- I'll tell you.

12:20.542 --> 12:22.785
You just got stuck with ten bucks.

12:26.967 --> 12:31.511
- Coach! Who is this clown?
- Which clown?

12:31.639 --> 12:34.047
Harry, please!

12:35.185 --> 12:36.596
Harry.

12:36.728 --> 12:39.849
Sam, I'm going. I was just playing.

12:39.982 --> 12:43.648
But whoever owns a Honda,
thanks for the lift!

12:50.662 --> 12:53.153
Did he take you for anything, Norm?

12:53.290 --> 12:59.376
Sorry? I was practising
suspending this coin in mid-air.

13:03.218 --> 13:04.629
Here.

13:04.762 --> 13:06.920
Carla, I'm fine!

13:07.056 --> 13:11.055
He's gonna ask you what's
your greatest memory in baseball.

13:11.186 --> 13:15.765
it's gotta be that double header
against the Orioles in '72.

13:15.900 --> 13:18.605
He saved both games
with seven pitches.

13:18.737 --> 13:20.361
Seven pitches.

13:20.489 --> 13:24.155
Wait a minute.
You wanna talk about excitement?

13:24.285 --> 13:26.741
Sam, tell 'em
about opening day in New York.

13:26.871 --> 13:32.080
You come out of the bullpen.
Bobby Mercer's at the plate.

13:32.211 --> 13:34.667
He hit a 400ft home run off me!

13:34.797 --> 13:37.918
It was the most exciting thing
I ever saw!

13:40.137 --> 13:44.716
Why would Sam wanna talk about
something bad happening to him?

13:44.851 --> 13:46.262
You're right.

13:46.394 --> 13:50.144
Sometimes I think
of the smartest thing to say,

13:50.274 --> 13:52.397
and then it comes out so stupid.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.021
That doesn't make sense.

13:54.154 --> 13:56.989
You should have heard it
before I said it!

13:59.160 --> 14:02.446
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah!

14:03.415 --> 14:07.496
- Well, Mayday, knock 'em dead.
- Thanks.

14:07.628 --> 14:11.792
- You ready, Sammy?
- Yeah. I am.

14:11.925 --> 14:15.259
Dave, listen. I'd like
to do this, if you don't mind.

14:15.387 --> 14:16.383
Yeah.

14:16.514 --> 14:19.385
We can talk
about my greatest thrill in sport,

14:19.517 --> 14:23.432
then I wanna talk
about my triumph over alcoholism.

14:23.564 --> 14:25.391
Good. Very good.

14:25.524 --> 14:28.016
It could be very powerful.

14:28.152 --> 14:31.736
Then we could talk about Cheers,
what I'm doing now.

14:31.865 --> 14:37.739
And we could talk about what I'd do
about the crisis in the Mideast.

14:37.872 --> 14:40.708
Yeah. The Cubs got that
by three and a half games.

14:44.755 --> 14:46.795
Should be a stimulating evening!

14:46.925 --> 14:48.123
Ready.

14:48.260 --> 14:51.843
A little bit more to the left, guys.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.647
- Roll tape.
- Rolling.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.484
Action!

15:03.611 --> 15:07.444
l'm standing here in a popular
Boston watering hole called Cheers.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.318
What's wrong with his voice?

15:11.454 --> 15:13.577
Come on, Diane, this is television!

15:13.706 --> 15:15.746
Cut the tape, Ernie.

15:15.876 --> 15:18.794
- Come on, Sam!
- I'm sorry.

15:18.921 --> 15:22.540
- I gotta start over now!
- You'll be alright.

15:24.428 --> 15:25.887
Gee whizz.

15:27.890 --> 15:30.097
- Roll it, Ernie.
- Rolling.

15:31.102 --> 15:35.979
I'm standing in a popular
watering hole called Cheers.

15:38.903 --> 15:42.154
Most of you will recognise
the guy standing next to me.

15:42.282 --> 15:45.153
Maybe you don't
when he's not in his Red Sox uniform.

15:45.286 --> 15:47.029
This is Sam "Mayday" Malone,

15:47.163 --> 15:49.701
ex-relief pitcher
from the Boston Red Sox,

15:49.833 --> 15:51.707
now owner and bartender at Cheers.

15:52.419 --> 15:56.833
- How you doing, Sam?
- I'm alright, Dave, thanks.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.542
That's great.

16:01.680 --> 16:06.308
You've been out of baseball
for five years. Do you miss it?

16:06.436 --> 16:11.229
I miss the fans. The people
of Boston were very good to me.

16:11.358 --> 16:13.150
Yeah.

16:16.531 --> 16:19.486
Tell us about some of
the great moments you had here.

16:19.618 --> 16:23.533
I guess I'd have to say
one day in Baltimore.

16:23.665 --> 16:26.619
You wanna tell us
a little bit about that, Sam?

16:26.752 --> 16:31.414
Well, I was working both ends
of a double header.

16:31.549 --> 16:34.883
It's the old story.
First game, bottom of the ninth.

16:35.011 --> 16:37.550
I'm coming in
with a man on second and third.

16:37.681 --> 16:40.849
We're holding on to a one-run lead
against the Birds.

16:40.977 --> 16:43.219
Boog Powell's coming up.

16:43.355 --> 16:46.475
I could feel the wind
from his warm-up swings.

16:46.608 --> 16:50.524
He had the heaviest bat in
the League. Papers were full of him.

16:50.655 --> 16:56.030
I figure the only way to get him is
to challenge him on the first pitch.

16:56.162 --> 16:57.739
If I get cute, he'll kill me.

16:57.872 --> 17:02.001
So I decide I'm gonna make him
wait on me, make him sweat.

17:02.127 --> 17:08.001
I adjust my cap, go down to
the rosin bag, walk around the mound.

17:08.134 --> 17:10.292
When I figure he's getting antsy...

17:10.428 --> 17:15.387
Dave, John McEnroe called. Said he's
got something to get off his chest.

17:15.518 --> 17:17.558
McEnroe.

17:20.357 --> 17:22.564
Dave, what...

17:22.693 --> 17:24.816
Sam, thank you. I'll catch you later.

17:27.198 --> 17:32.194
- What happened?
- I guess he got a better interview.

17:32.329 --> 17:34.655
No. What happened to the Boog person?

17:36.543 --> 17:38.370
He grounded to third.

17:38.503 --> 17:42.253
- Coach, let's serve some drinks.
- Right, Sam.

17:42.383 --> 17:44.175
Tennis is a sissy game.

17:44.302 --> 17:47.303
- Come on. We got thirsty people.
- Damn shame, Sammy.

17:47.431 --> 17:48.842
No sweat.

17:48.974 --> 17:51.548
I'm gonna be in back, cleaning up.

17:51.686 --> 17:54.771
- That's our job, Sam.
- It's my bar, Carla!

17:56.817 --> 18:01.444
Carla, will you watch my customers
while I'm gone, please?

18:01.573 --> 18:05.488
Sure. I'll act geeky,
give 'em the wrong drinks.

18:05.619 --> 18:08.786
- They'll never know you're gone.
- Thanks.

18:12.669 --> 18:16.537
Sam, this could be
a crucial moment in your life.

18:16.674 --> 18:21.087
It's vitally important
you handle your emotions properly.

18:21.221 --> 18:24.922
The worst thing anyone
in a situation like this could do

18:25.059 --> 18:27.384
is to repress his feelings.

18:27.520 --> 18:30.724
Diane, get out, please.

18:30.857 --> 18:36.861
You need to lash out.
To release yourself. Scream.

18:36.990 --> 18:40.940
- Get out!
- Wonderful! Alright.

18:41.078 --> 18:46.998
We need now to move away from brute
emotions into the more cerebral.

18:47.127 --> 18:51.836
Tell me in one sentence what you
perceive to be your problem now.

18:51.966 --> 18:54.457
You won't leave.

18:54.594 --> 18:56.219
Let's come back to that.

18:56.972 --> 19:02.513
Other people have been through
what you're feeling.

19:02.645 --> 19:08.186
Even, in a slightly different way,
myself.

19:08.318 --> 19:11.770
Would you like me to share
an experience from my life

19:11.906 --> 19:14.065
when I was defeated and humiliated?

19:17.329 --> 19:21.957
Diane, I don't wanna hear
a lead in a high school play story.

19:22.085 --> 19:25.585
It's not a lead
in the high school play story.

19:25.714 --> 19:29.250
I don't wanna hear an "I didn't
get asked to the junior prom" story.

19:29.385 --> 19:33.965
It's not an "I didn't get asked
to the junior prom" story.

19:34.099 --> 19:38.098
I sure don't wanna hear an "I didn't
get elected cheerleader" story.

19:38.229 --> 19:42.097
OK, if you're just gonna
make a big joke about it...

19:42.734 --> 19:44.692
I hit it, didn't l?

19:44.820 --> 19:47.027
Sam, I was terrific!

19:47.156 --> 19:52.033
What happened to me today
put a period at the end of my career.

19:53.747 --> 19:57.082
The last thing I need
is a cheerleader right now.

19:57.210 --> 20:00.579
Well, that's what you need the most!

20:03.384 --> 20:07.596
You know, I was looking at you
at that interview today.

20:08.640 --> 20:13.102
I didn't see
a washed-up ex-former has-been.

20:14.522 --> 20:20.146
No, I saw a guy who has a great deal
to look back on with pride.

20:21.197 --> 20:24.068
And a great deal
to look forward to with hope.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.324
Yeah?

20:26.453 --> 20:29.620
It didn't hurt that you
were standing next to a Cro-Magnon.

20:33.420 --> 20:37.632
Sam, here's the point.
You have to put the past behind you.

20:37.758 --> 20:40.546
You have to turn and face the future.

20:40.678 --> 20:43.596
You have to open your eyes,
see what's in front of you.

20:43.723 --> 20:47.093
You're young, you're alive.
Feel that in your whole body.

20:47.228 --> 20:51.558
Appreciate what you've got.
Live for today. Go for it, Sam!

20:51.691 --> 20:54.017
I tell you, go for it!

20:59.742 --> 21:01.201
Are you OK?

21:01.328 --> 21:05.409
Yeah... I'm fine.

21:06.167 --> 21:09.287
Look. One of my lights is out!

21:11.924 --> 21:17.167
It's a reflex I learned in a class.
Practical Feminism.

21:21.226 --> 21:24.097
What was your final?
Crippling a Buick?

21:26.524 --> 21:28.149
I'm sorry I had to do that,

21:28.276 --> 21:32.227
but I came in with honourable
intentions of helping you out.

21:32.365 --> 21:35.034
No, I'm sorry, you're right.
Thank you.

21:35.160 --> 21:39.822
I really appreciate you coming
in here. High point of my day.

21:40.875 --> 21:42.784
How long have you wanted to do that?

21:44.337 --> 21:45.796
Do what?

21:46.506 --> 21:48.464
Kiss me.

21:48.592 --> 21:51.262
How long have you denied
that burning desire?

21:54.766 --> 21:58.100
It just came to me.
It was an impulse.

22:00.106 --> 22:04.104
Good, cos if you've been thinking
about anything between us,

22:04.236 --> 22:07.440
- it's out of the question.
- No, I haven't.

22:07.573 --> 22:09.400
Good.

22:10.827 --> 22:14.161
Listen, Diane. Thank you.

22:14.289 --> 22:17.326
I will put the past behind me,

22:17.460 --> 22:20.545
and tomorrow I'll feel better.

22:20.672 --> 22:24.207
But tonight I'm gonna feel bad. OK?

22:26.262 --> 22:27.922
Yeah, OK.

22:36.858 --> 22:38.269
Will you do me a favour?

22:39.152 --> 22:42.320
You want me to try
and take your purse, right?

22:47.120 --> 22:49.243
OK, I deserved that.

22:49.373 --> 22:53.038
No, I'm curious.
I want to hear about the Booger.

22:53.169 --> 22:56.954
- The what?
- The guy from Baltimore.

22:57.090 --> 23:02.964
Listen, I may not have had 80 majors,
but I know when I'm being patronised.

23:03.640 --> 23:06.807
Second game, bottom of the ninth,
Boog's up again...

23:06.935 --> 23:10.269
- Again?
- I'm seeing the clown in my dreams.

23:10.398 --> 23:12.854
See, if I serve him a gopher ball,

23:12.984 --> 23:15.820
we're five games out of
first place with eight to play.

23:15.946 --> 23:19.280
There's only one guy on base,
but it's Don Buford.

23:19.408 --> 23:24.285
He's over there dancing around.
I had to go over there 20 times.

23:24.414 --> 23:27.416
To talk to him about dancing?

23:28.085 --> 23:31.206
No. You see,
you gotta throw the ball to first

23:31.339 --> 23:33.665
to keep the runner close to the bag.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.295
If you don't...

23:35.427 --> 23:38.345
Wait. Don't you throw the ball
at the batter?

23:40.517 --> 23:44.052
Look, this story's going nowhere.
Let's just forget it.

23:44.188 --> 23:49.479
- Good. Now my cheerleader story.
- OK, Buford's on first...

23:52.239 --> 23:54.528
- Where?
- Right there.

23:54.659 --> 23:58.527
Put it down. Easy mistake.
I'll give you another shot.

24:07.465 --> 24:12.128
Gentlemen. One more time, please.

24:12.263 --> 24:15.632
Let me give you a chance
to break even. I feel just terrible!
