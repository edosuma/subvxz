20:09.542 --> 20:11.242
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

20:11.244 --> 20:14.145
Ooh, maybe throwing
a Chinese new year party

20:14.147 --> 20:15.813
at cattleman's
becomes our new tradition.

20:15.815 --> 20:18.916
Yeah, maybe.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.427
Grandma, that's very generous,

20:29.429 --> 20:30.761
but all we need is your love.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.330
I'll take Emery's!

20:32.332 --> 20:35.433
No! I was just expressing
a sentiment, you animal!

20:35.435 --> 20:36.400
No!

20:36.402 --> 20:38.002

- Give it to me!

[ Laughs ]

20:45.044 --> 20:46.444
Thanks, everybody,
for a great Chinese new year.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.212
But the celebration
wouldn't be complete

20:48.214 --> 20:50.114
without the grand finale.

20:50.116 --> 20:51.582
Fireworks!

20:51.584 --> 20:53.718
[ Laughter ] Jessica:
Ooh, we have fireworks!

20:53.720 --> 20:55.620

[ Laughter ]

20:56.789 --> 20:58.389
Have you ever noticed

20:58.391 --> 21:00.558
how American and Chinese dogs
speak differently?

21:00.560 --> 21:04.295
American dogs go,
"bow-wow, bow-wow."

21:04.297 --> 21:07.431
Chinese dogs go,
"wong-wong, wong-wong!"

21:07.433 --> 21:08.899
[ Laughs ]

21:08.901 --> 21:10.134
You know,
that's funny because it's true.

21:10.136 --> 21:11.068
[ Laughter ]

21:11.070 --> 21:13.471
What's the deal with Capri suns?

21:13.473 --> 21:16.641
I have to puncture
a foil pouch with a straw.

21:16.643 --> 21:19.577
Hello, I'm a child,
not a registered nurse.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.079
Oh, he's bringing out
the big guns.

[ Rim shot ]

21:23.883 --> 21:25.850
What else? What else?
