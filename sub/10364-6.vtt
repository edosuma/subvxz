- Why wouldn't I want to do that?
- Right.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.120
Hi, Dag.

33:41.400 --> 33:43.120
It's good to see you.

34:00.360 --> 34:03.360
I hope you can forgive me.

34:03.440 --> 34:06.280
Everything became so damn complicated...

34:13.920 --> 34:15.640
You're a good guy, Dag.

34:17.240 --> 34:18.920
Truly, a great guy.

- Hi.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.960
We're from the TV licensing department.

34:57.640 --> 34:59.640
We don't have a TV.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.240
Okay.
Then what are we hearing in there?

35:05.720 --> 35:06.720
The radio.

35:07.720 --> 35:11.360
I'm afraid
you'll have to let us in for a peek.

35:20.720 --> 35:21.920
How much do we owe?

35:27.120 --> 35:28.920
[screams in rage]

35:29.000 --> 35:32.800

the cocaine as agreed.

35:44.320 --> 35:48.800
You're a good man. It's good
for the patients to get out now and then.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.760
- [Jan] Yeah?
- [nurse] Yeah.

35:50.840 --> 35:54.680
You have a nice visit at your friend's.

35:54.760 --> 35:58.040
Hear that, Daggy?
We're going to go visit Uncle Jan.

35:58.120 --> 35:59.640
[nurse] No baby talk, please.

35:59.720 --> 36:02.440
- What?
- We don't like that around here.

36:02.520 --> 36:04.560
Of course not. I fully understand.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.760
Okay, have a nice trip.

36:11.240 --> 36:15.640
- How much are we talking?
- Three million.

36:15.720 --> 36:17.200

36:17.280 --> 36:20.240
One next week, two the week after.

36:20.320 --> 36:24.160
But I don't have that kind of money.
What happens if I don't...?

See you next week.

what the fuck is going on? Huh?

36:59.680 --> 37:01.320
Fucking rat.

37:02.480 --> 37:06.680
You got to understand. Things for me
in the States are not ideal right now.

37:06.760 --> 37:08.600
Where the fuck am I going to go?

37:09.600 --> 37:13.480
You can go to fucking Siberia
for all I care, as long as you leave.

You're more loyal to these
fucking  stranieri  than your own family.

37:21.680 --> 37:26.200
These  stranieri  are more family to me
than you ever were.

how's that Brazilian broad
settling in with your brother?

To be honest,
I don't think she's that into him.

She moved into Mølla hotel.

- [Torgeir] Yeah.

Uh... Alex...

I don't know. Alexandra...

Five, five...

That's her.

Hey.

who his mystery date is?

40:54.720 --> 40:56.760
I have no idea.

I don't know if...

- What?
- Did you check out her ass?

Yeah. Didn't you?

41:09.600 --> 41:12.720
- Of course, but...
- It's wrong if I do it?

41:12.800 --> 41:19.160
It's just weird to date someone
who swings both ways.

Everyone is bisexual.
I'm sure you've been turned on by men.

- Hello.

You know Torgeir.
