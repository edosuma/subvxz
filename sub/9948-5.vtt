WEBVTT

00:00.047 --> 00:02.968
Anyone watching thinking
we know fuck all

00:03.000 --> 00:06.799
about knowing fuck all about owt,
needs to watch their back.

00:06.910 --> 00:10.029
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:10.030 --> 00:11.789
sending prices sky high.

00:11.790 --> 00:15.789
Literally, literally taking
the grass from its own roots!

00:16.091 --> 00:18.804
And now you've
got your ConDemNation...

00:18.847 --> 00:22.234
Liberals noshing Tories like
altar boys picking dimps up!

00:22.270 --> 00:25.749
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?

00:25.750 --> 00:28.429
Is revolution a word?

00:28.430 --> 00:29.629
Or was it never?

00:29.630 --> 00:32.149
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:32.150 --> 00:35.589
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:35.590 --> 00:38.909
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

00:38.910 --> 00:41.669
and they charge us for water!

00:42.240 --> 00:46.953
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found...

00:46.990 --> 00:50.382
This green
and pleasant land in ancient time...

00:50.414 --> 00:53.437
Yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak!

00:53.476 --> 00:54.909
It's not theirs anymore.

00:54.910 --> 00:59.539
This is our England, now.

00:59.585 --> 01:02.549
Party!

01:06.979 --> 01:10.589
As far back as I can remember,
I never wanted to be a gangster.

01:10.750 --> 01:13.471
But what chance when you're
born into a family like mine?

01:14.557 --> 01:18.109
And once you're in that world,
image becomes everything.

01:19.627 --> 01:22.229
But how long should you
carry that image with you?

01:22.670 --> 01:25.385
How much does it count
as time hurtles on?

01:25.769 --> 01:27.648
Even for you straight goers,

01:27.758 --> 01:29.917
I bet it was important to be seen
as one of the toughest,

01:29.957 --> 01:31.316
or coolest kids in school.

01:32.232 --> 01:35.674
Does that matter,
five, ten, 20 years on,

01:36.237 --> 01:38.889
driving your white van
or your company car,

01:39.346 --> 01:42.631
fantasising about getting a grip
of the secretary at the work's do?

01:43.830 --> 01:47.010
But in my world,
it's harder to shake.

01:48.096 --> 01:52.095
What's it going to take to realise
that image can mean fuck all?

01:59.486 --> 02:01.205
Sequels are never as good.

02:01.316 --> 02:04.252
I thought the first one was shit.
What time's your mum back?

02:04.885 --> 02:06.222
Half hour yet...

02:06.239 --> 02:07.745
We better get a move on, then.

02:15.133 --> 02:16.678
What's all this about?

02:16.733 --> 02:18.178
BANGING ON DOOR

02:20.000 --> 02:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:27.270 --> 02:28.916
Stop it.

02:43.814 --> 02:45.502
Aidan!

02:46.686 --> 02:48.005
What's wrong with you?

02:48.064 --> 02:49.749
You've been late
every day this week.

02:50.461 --> 02:51.822
I'll see you there.

02:51.878 --> 02:53.423
You're losing it.

03:04.825 --> 03:07.384
The cheeky little baghead's
swerving again.

03:07.439 --> 03:10.038
Name me a junky
that doesn't try it on?

03:10.555 --> 03:12.033
Laters, Slash.

03:13.955 --> 03:15.749
Leave it out, you tramp! Urgh!

03:15.750 --> 03:19.236
Pay up, or else those needles'll be
going into places

03:19.305 --> 03:20.822
they really shouldn't!

03:20.908 --> 03:22.212
Who's that?

03:22.252 --> 03:23.509
Stuart, the window cleaner.

03:23.510 --> 03:26.846
Window licker!
Always pleading poverty.

03:27.514 --> 03:29.252
He needs a visit.

03:30.013 --> 03:31.720
Er, why can't nobhead go?

03:32.214 --> 03:33.627
Who you calling nobhead?

03:33.694 --> 03:35.361
Cos you've got more of a presence.

03:35.393 --> 03:36.689
No, he hasn't!

03:36.723 --> 03:40.080
Oh, come on, baby... why do you think
we never send you out on your own?

03:42.314 --> 03:43.729
Where's he live?

04:21.420 --> 04:24.221
Try and make it last longer.
Supply's getting low.

04:46.843 --> 04:49.102
Thanks. See y'in a bit.

04:52.758 --> 04:56.242
Since when does a copy
of Manchester Mail cost 40 quid?

04:57.058 --> 04:59.797
Nah,
they were settling their mum's bill.

05:04.478 --> 05:06.517
We had an agreement, Ches.

05:06.627 --> 05:09.766
If you serve weed, you come to us...

05:12.586 --> 05:13.915
It's not weed.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.727
Well, it's funny-looking bugle.

05:18.266 --> 05:19.875
That's not normal weed.

05:20.750 --> 05:22.125
What is it?

05:22.821 --> 05:24.136
My cousin sent a sampler.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.479
Some herbal shit.

05:25.535 --> 05:26.836
Is it legal?

05:27.352 --> 05:29.555
Until the government hear
about people having a good time.

05:29.610 --> 05:31.055
What do you do? Smoke it?

05:31.105 --> 05:34.188
Yeah. Pipe, bong, bake in a cake...
birds love it.

05:34.234 --> 05:35.343
Yeah?

05:35.407 --> 05:37.977
My Nena's well into
that earthy shit, you know,

05:38.252 --> 05:40.172
hairy armpits,
doesn't shave her legs,

05:40.205 --> 05:43.352
fuck off full on hairy growler.
I love it.

05:43.620 --> 05:47.055
Oh, Shane, leave it out.
That's all that's left.

05:47.110 --> 05:49.352
Well, you're lucky
I won't have to tell our Jamie,

05:50.107 --> 05:52.039
you'd be taxed a lot more than this.

05:57.735 --> 05:59.611
I'm not gonna
get in trouble over you.

05:59.652 --> 06:01.091
Is Miss Heaton back yet?

06:01.438 --> 06:04.813
She'll be back in next week.
Driving us mad with her shit poems.

06:05.116 --> 06:06.914
Do you think we should
hand ourselves in?

06:06.961 --> 06:08.460
- To who?
- The police.

06:08.708 --> 06:10.676
- You right in the head?
- They might go easy on us.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.208
- For what? I did nothing.
- Exactly.

06:13.627 --> 06:16.033
So, why haven't you been yet?
She knows who we are.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.646
- Makes you wonder.
- About what?

06:19.204 --> 06:21.205
- Maybe Frasier was right.
- About what?

06:21.386 --> 06:22.853
Maybe she wanted it?

06:28.369 --> 06:30.629
Miss Sporritt asked me
where you were.

06:31.244 --> 06:34.009
Look, if you don't get a grip,
they'll send you to another school.

06:34.198 --> 06:35.580
Least of my worries.

06:36.927 --> 06:38.469
Fancy the Trafford Centre?

06:39.105 --> 06:40.304
Come on, then.

06:40.727 --> 06:42.539
Who's this little honey?

06:43.183 --> 06:45.069
- Hellooo.
- Eww.

06:45.421 --> 06:47.740
You go, I'll catch you later.

06:47.827 --> 06:49.226
You're gonna stay with these jokers?

06:49.251 --> 06:50.730
For a bit. It's all right.

06:56.172 --> 06:58.730
A little mouse tells me
you're behaving irrationally.

07:00.972 --> 07:02.473
The police?

07:02.524 --> 07:04.283
You know I wouldn't.

07:04.379 --> 07:06.538
Cos I'll find you,
and I'll kill you.

07:06.570 --> 07:07.871
I wouldn't.

07:08.050 --> 07:10.582
Living with one of the fuckers
must be messing with you.

07:10.651 --> 07:11.957
Must be.

07:12.123 --> 07:14.855
She hasn't reported anything.
Agreed?

07:16.636 --> 07:18.714
So how have we
done anything wrong, then?

07:19.837 --> 07:21.160
Eh?

07:22.750 --> 07:25.433
That's my boy, Aidan, back on track.

07:26.216 --> 07:28.879
Too right,
the dirty bitch wanted it.

07:29.230 --> 07:31.343
Just like that little split-arse
you were sat with.

07:31.375 --> 07:32.652
She's all right.

07:32.699 --> 07:34.777
Well, tell her to bring some mates
and meet us in the park.

07:34.879 --> 07:36.278
She won't want to.

07:36.372 --> 07:38.771
Come on, Aidan, share the wealth.

07:39.054 --> 07:41.746
Olly hanging out of the back of her,
while she sucks me off.

07:42.891 --> 07:44.230
Come on.

07:51.519 --> 07:53.238
You little bastard!

07:53.264 --> 07:55.253
You better be on your toes,
I'll find you.

07:55.348 --> 07:57.581
Do it good then, cos I'll
cut you up proper, next time.

07:57.630 --> 07:59.190
You all right?

08:04.956 --> 08:06.644
(GRUNTS)

08:06.716 --> 08:09.275
(CACKLES) Aw!

08:09.463 --> 08:11.113
Thought you were at work?

08:12.057 --> 08:14.769
Anyone'd think you want me
on my back all day.

08:14.770 --> 08:16.409
It's a gender thing,

08:16.410 --> 08:19.932
women are from Venus,
men are arseholes.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.932
Thought you were a wanted man
this side of Manchester.

08:26.993 --> 08:28.767
And everywhere else.

08:32.933 --> 08:35.019
Hey, look at this, look at this, eh?
Look at that!

08:35.020 --> 08:36.691
Life's certainly
looking after you, eh?

08:36.711 --> 08:38.730
I can still bench press 200 pounds.

08:38.750 --> 08:39.909
So can my sister.

08:39.929 --> 08:41.659
I can believe that,
I've met your sister.

08:44.820 --> 08:47.785
Still got the gab, eh? Nice one!

08:48.285 --> 08:50.223
Good to see ya. Drink?

08:50.276 --> 08:51.637
Yeah.

09:22.140 --> 09:23.579
Satan!

09:23.845 --> 09:25.149
Get rid of the dog.

09:25.178 --> 09:26.137
So you can do me in?

09:26.162 --> 09:27.477
Not if you pay up.

09:33.250 --> 09:34.489
Behave.

09:34.490 --> 09:35.618
It's been slow.

09:35.649 --> 09:37.056
Stop lying.

09:37.295 --> 09:39.665
You've served enough bagheads
to remake Dawn Of The Dead.

09:41.759 --> 09:43.176
Where's your Shane?

09:43.294 --> 09:45.235
Exactly, he's the horrible one.

09:45.774 --> 09:47.282
You can trust me.

09:52.754 --> 09:57.423
Just put the dog outside and then
we can work on a new repayment plan.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.946
It's for the best.

10:09.566 --> 10:11.384
Aah!

10:15.267 --> 10:18.360
"Where's your Shane?"
What you trying to say?

10:24.376 --> 10:27.352
Stuart!
Stuart, they're getting worse!

10:56.455 --> 10:58.169
DOG BARKS

10:58.557 --> 11:00.025
Aaagh!

11:01.076 --> 11:03.330
Get off me, you filthy bastard!

11:09.282 --> 11:10.609
Fuck off!

11:10.610 --> 11:11.649
Are you the ambulance?

11:11.650 --> 11:13.129
I need one!

11:13.130 --> 11:14.449
Where's Stuart?

11:14.480 --> 11:16.386
Stuart!

11:19.761 --> 11:22.315
He's, er, he's just popped out.

11:22.371 --> 11:24.770
Aaaaargh!

11:25.170 --> 11:26.449
Stomach cramps?

11:26.450 --> 11:28.363
I'm having a baby!

11:29.141 --> 11:31.940
We should have gone hours ago!

11:32.129 --> 11:33.894
I need to get to hospital!

11:33.932 --> 11:35.291
Now!

11:35.316 --> 11:38.635
Aaaaargh!

11:38.848 --> 11:41.582
Please, call an ambulance!

11:42.051 --> 11:44.043
Do something...!

11:47.680 --> 11:50.399
Hello, someone?

11:50.917 --> 11:52.830
I'm scared.

11:52.894 --> 11:54.413
Just don't worry.

11:54.523 --> 11:59.230
Aaaaaaaaagh!

12:01.530 --> 12:04.489
There's your cards, yeah?
Stick 'em in, anywhere you like.

12:04.490 --> 12:08.289
If he worked South Manchester,
he might know our Gaz.

12:08.290 --> 12:09.609
He's a proper copper.

12:09.610 --> 12:11.489
Put people in big jail,

12:11.490 --> 12:14.049
not on Fraggle Rock
with all the other nonces.

12:14.050 --> 12:15.529
Gaz is an armed robber!

12:15.683 --> 12:17.212
Yeah, if you say so.

12:17.252 --> 12:18.668
He fucking is!

12:18.769 --> 12:20.209
What's with Derren Brown?

12:20.210 --> 12:21.753
Some piece of bacon.

12:23.072 --> 12:24.511
Arseholes.

12:25.316 --> 12:27.433
Old mate of Jamie's, a copper.

12:27.711 --> 12:29.870
Jamie don't have mates in the force.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.221
Evening, Officer.

12:37.768 --> 12:39.367
Carl Gallagher, how d'you know?

12:39.569 --> 12:42.048
This nose can smell pork
a mile off, son.

12:42.371 --> 12:43.835
Where d'you work out of?

12:43.875 --> 12:46.222
Run along, son, no questions.

12:46.530 --> 12:48.169
The big boys are playing this end.

12:48.584 --> 12:50.063
Carl's all right, he's a mate.

12:50.212 --> 12:52.808
What do your superiors
think of that, son?

12:58.845 --> 13:00.347
Remember this one?

13:03.578 --> 13:06.730
I hope this little fella won't
follow in his father's footsteps.

13:06.783 --> 13:08.855
- Never.
- Jamie's doing all right now.

13:09.571 --> 13:11.472
Always knew he had more about him.

13:11.698 --> 13:15.697
Hardworking, surrounded by a loving
family, that's what it's all about.

13:16.724 --> 13:19.449
I've seen good men waste
chunks of their lives inside.

13:20.307 --> 13:22.675
I'm glad that hasn't happened
to your boy.

13:28.186 --> 13:30.441
I have an appointment.

13:32.370 --> 13:34.464
- Listen, mate...
- This isn't the time.

13:34.965 --> 13:36.362
I'll be back.

13:37.564 --> 13:39.488
Very nice to have met you all.

13:48.010 --> 13:49.809
He promised he wouldn't touch any.

13:49.810 --> 13:50.849
Not today.

13:50.850 --> 13:52.209
Smackhead by name.

13:52.210 --> 13:54.089
He hates me going back to college,

13:54.090 --> 13:56.777
but I won't let him
keep me down any more.

13:59.677 --> 14:02.199
Stuart? It's coming!

14:04.660 --> 14:06.283
Fucking bastard!

14:06.330 --> 14:07.925
We'll be able to get an ambulance.

14:09.232 --> 14:11.027
The Scumbag's left the dog!

14:11.155 --> 14:13.175
Hasn't fed him either, by the sound.

14:16.972 --> 14:19.331
Will the baby be a smackhead?

14:19.450 --> 14:21.529
I stopped straight away.

14:21.530 --> 14:23.809
The doctor's gone on
about the weight,

14:23.810 --> 14:26.168
but eating's got to be better
than injecting?

14:27.250 --> 14:29.409
If you're pregnant,
you can get away with it.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.569
Been taking folic acid?

14:31.570 --> 14:35.569
Daily, high strength and
soluble aspirin to thin my blood.

14:35.610 --> 14:38.207
Your size and that
won't be a bad thing.

14:42.970 --> 14:44.316
Oh...

14:46.058 --> 14:47.489
I used to write.

14:47.490 --> 14:49.209
Course you did.

14:49.210 --> 14:51.894
Yeah, short stories
and they got published...

14:52.450 --> 14:54.089
online.

14:54.090 --> 14:56.902
So why are you bullying
people to pay debts?

14:57.361 --> 14:59.136
Writing can get lonely.

15:00.148 --> 15:01.547
So, read to me.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.169
Transport your mind?

15:03.170 --> 15:04.849
It'll help forget the pain.

15:04.850 --> 15:06.730
Nah, it's nowt really.

15:07.629 --> 15:10.199
(GROANS LOUDLY)

15:10.250 --> 15:12.378
Be strong, girl, yeah?

15:12.421 --> 15:14.003
You're bang on track.

15:14.656 --> 15:16.089
Read!

15:17.095 --> 15:19.972
"Chapter One, I am born.

15:20.408 --> 15:24.247
"Whether I shall turn out to be
the hero of my own life..."

15:24.443 --> 15:25.847
You OK?

15:26.709 --> 15:28.902
I think men should have to
wear heels.

15:29.650 --> 15:33.649
Proper seven inch, fuck-me stilettos,

15:33.970 --> 15:35.582
just for a day.

15:39.934 --> 15:41.496
Are you going to tell me?

15:43.098 --> 15:46.479
Five years ago, when you and I
were just about to marry,

15:47.980 --> 15:49.918
you were having second thoughts.

15:49.981 --> 15:53.260
'I murdered all three of them.
I'm not proud of it

15:53.410 --> 15:56.409
'but they deserved it and I'd do it
again under the same circumstances.'

15:56.894 --> 15:59.300
It wasn't the clean job I'd hoped.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.788
Brooksy made some
evidence disappear.

16:02.875 --> 16:04.114
Why?

16:04.482 --> 16:06.949
Him and me dad
came to an arrangement.

16:07.233 --> 16:08.816
How much?

16:09.890 --> 16:12.964
Brooksy has two houses in Spain,
and one in Portugal that I know of.

16:13.392 --> 16:15.111
Who knows about this?

16:15.206 --> 16:17.464
Me dad, me and now you.

16:20.911 --> 16:23.738
Maybe he's just checking up.

16:24.838 --> 16:27.941
No, he doesn't make social calls.

16:29.855 --> 16:31.472
That's my boy...

16:31.738 --> 16:33.178
Oooh, yeah...

16:33.211 --> 16:36.285
Don't do it... No! No!

16:36.490 --> 16:38.649
Go on, Slappy.

16:39.894 --> 16:41.123
No!

16:41.249 --> 16:42.519
No!

16:43.250 --> 16:44.580
For fuck's sake!

16:45.136 --> 16:46.486
It's your turn.

16:47.134 --> 16:48.470
Already?

16:50.199 --> 16:52.916
Your turn to soothe sleeping beauty!

16:53.348 --> 16:54.870
No, no!

17:00.229 --> 17:01.714
Aidan,

17:02.487 --> 17:04.729
- it's OK... Aidan.
- NO!

17:05.429 --> 17:06.976
- Mum?
- Slag!

17:07.859 --> 17:10.739
Aidan, it's all right, it's OK,
it's OK, it's OK!

17:10.849 --> 17:12.280
Where am I?

17:12.319 --> 17:15.890
At home, it's all right,
it's going to be all right.

17:23.369 --> 17:25.449
I cry, like, ten times an episode.

17:25.450 --> 17:26.929
The Hills?

17:26.930 --> 17:29.449
One Born Every Minute, keep up.

17:29.450 --> 17:31.369
It's hard to concentrate.

17:31.370 --> 17:33.729
That fat white bird
who had the Chinese twins,

17:33.730 --> 17:36.388
wore the deep vein stockings, oh!

17:36.786 --> 17:38.911
I'm going to take care of myself
after this.

17:38.982 --> 17:40.302
Your baby needs you to.

17:40.330 --> 17:41.809
It's embarrassing.

17:41.810 --> 17:45.255
25 five years old and
nothing to show for it.

17:46.747 --> 17:48.278
You will have, soon.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.479
Anyone can have kids.

17:50.605 --> 17:52.084
No, they can't.

17:52.210 --> 17:55.825
Your little one will be like
the biggest achievement of all.

17:56.445 --> 17:57.872
Have you got kids?

17:59.107 --> 18:01.366
One day.
Do you know what you're having?

18:01.398 --> 18:03.197
She's a girl, Jasmine.

18:03.581 --> 18:06.255
Nice... like the rice.

18:11.904 --> 18:13.234
I'm getting up.

18:13.281 --> 18:15.083
You gotta go to school, mate.

18:16.174 --> 18:17.505
Do you want to talk about it?

18:17.987 --> 18:19.449
I can't.

18:19.450 --> 18:23.449
You'd be surprised.

18:25.650 --> 18:29.649
Poof! Sorry.

18:29.995 --> 18:31.458
Does Kelly like her job?

18:31.794 --> 18:33.145
Kelly?

18:35.670 --> 18:37.317
She likes her independence.

18:38.204 --> 18:40.060
Mainly works when she chooses.

18:41.356 --> 18:42.888
Dirty bitch!

18:45.970 --> 18:47.622
Wonder if my mum liked it?

18:59.638 --> 19:03.637
ALL SHOUTING ENCOURAGEMENT

19:05.785 --> 19:07.724
That the best you've got?

19:10.810 --> 19:13.263
No performance enhancing substances.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.622
Fucking drug tester, here!

19:19.508 --> 19:21.060
Oh 'ello darling!

19:21.134 --> 19:23.474
Ooooh,

19:23.847 --> 19:25.606
YES!

19:25.817 --> 19:27.456
Get in!

19:27.730 --> 19:30.966
Want to go again, double it?
Double it?!

19:31.250 --> 19:34.544
That's a lot of money at the minute,
so I think quit

19:34.850 --> 19:35.969
while we're ahead.

19:35.970 --> 19:37.569
She's right, I'm not earning.

19:37.570 --> 19:40.302
Better run along, then,
do as wifey says.

19:41.247 --> 19:42.591
Jackson!

19:45.247 --> 19:46.849
Back so soon, mate?

19:46.850 --> 19:48.528
Who could stay away from this?

19:50.278 --> 19:51.615
You're a very lucky man.

19:51.671 --> 19:53.606
I've got to nip to the cash'n'carry,
fancy some air?

19:53.664 --> 19:55.794
Sure, I'll buy you lunch.

20:39.312 --> 20:40.770
Go on?

20:48.081 --> 20:49.614
Stand and do nothing!

20:52.190 --> 20:54.028
Is that all you're good for?

20:56.490 --> 20:58.044
Did you like it?

21:02.037 --> 21:03.661
You make me sick.

21:15.090 --> 21:16.880
Look, I promise I'm on it.

21:16.997 --> 21:18.724
I'll bell you when something
comes through.

21:18.786 --> 21:20.130
You better do.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.372
You're right, it is a bird thing.

21:28.530 --> 21:30.329
- I need more.
- You took it all.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.919
I'm telling you,
she gets filthy on the sniff.

21:33.027 --> 21:35.130
You should see the stuff
she's doing on this shit.

21:35.485 --> 21:37.484
We'll take all your cousin can get.

21:37.513 --> 21:38.609
He's been nicked.

21:38.610 --> 21:40.169
I thought you said it was legal.

21:40.170 --> 21:41.209
It is.

21:41.210 --> 21:44.099
So, let's get to Bradford,
someone'll know his supplier.

21:44.190 --> 21:45.622
He's in Pakistan.

21:45.653 --> 21:47.060
Fuck!

21:49.010 --> 21:50.833
I think I can source
something over here.

21:50.895 --> 21:52.231
The same gear?

21:52.267 --> 21:53.751
Hopefully.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.086
Cheers, mate.

21:57.121 --> 21:58.423
Thank you.

22:04.690 --> 22:06.649
The slop in jail was
better than this.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.384
Just be happy you're not
still in there tasting it.

22:10.747 --> 22:12.376
So what's this about?

22:13.055 --> 22:14.440
Remember my little girl?

22:14.488 --> 22:15.798
Vaguely.

22:17.317 --> 22:19.040
24 years old now.

22:21.572 --> 22:22.985
What happened?

22:23.156 --> 22:24.571
Her husband got a bit handy.

22:25.197 --> 22:27.509
Broke her jaw, cheekbone...

22:27.890 --> 22:29.809
She had to get off, in hiding.

22:29.810 --> 22:31.212
Piece of shit.

22:33.764 --> 22:35.970
Worst thing is, my hands are tied.

22:37.363 --> 22:38.743
I'm under investigation.

22:39.450 --> 22:41.689
I'd do anything, see ya later,

22:42.072 --> 22:46.704
no pension, no property, maximum
security for my own protection,

22:47.173 --> 22:49.157
in with the nonces and the rag-heads.

22:49.890 --> 22:51.243
That'd be the end of me.

22:53.926 --> 22:55.368
I don't like asking.

22:57.776 --> 22:59.485
I kept you on the outside.

23:00.410 --> 23:02.837
We wouldn't want any
historical evidence

23:02.873 --> 23:04.704
suddenly re-surfacing, would we?

23:07.390 --> 23:08.789
No, we wouldn't.

23:11.556 --> 23:12.885
How bad do you want him?

23:12.909 --> 23:14.227
All the way bad.

23:14.873 --> 23:16.212
Still got it in you?

23:21.500 --> 23:22.812
Yeah.

23:24.509 --> 23:25.948
I'll stay at your place.

23:26.290 --> 23:29.409
If I'm in the Jockey,
I've got a pub full of witnesses.

23:32.850 --> 23:34.181
Where is he?

23:35.130 --> 23:36.477
The one in the black.

23:47.250 --> 23:50.729
Aaaaaaaaggggghhh, fucking hell!

23:50.730 --> 23:53.729
Push! Push.
Look, the head is right there.

23:53.730 --> 23:55.489
Nnnnnngggg!

23:55.490 --> 23:57.147
Push!

23:58.530 --> 24:00.729
The next one, I can tell.

24:00.730 --> 24:02.809
GRUNTING

24:02.810 --> 24:04.409
Almost! Go on, girl.

24:04.410 --> 24:06.209
WAILING

24:06.210 --> 24:09.849
Go on! Go on!

24:09.850 --> 24:13.849
Aaarrggghh!

24:13.970 --> 24:16.655
MEWLING

24:28.050 --> 24:29.835
Say hello to little Jasmine.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.999
DOG WHIMPERS

24:34.063 --> 24:35.422
What's happening?

24:36.375 --> 24:37.609
You've got a baby.

24:37.646 --> 24:38.859
Where's my money?

24:38.883 --> 24:40.217
It's my money.

24:40.250 --> 24:41.929
Put the dog away, you can come in.

24:41.930 --> 24:44.289
Keep that lazy junkie out of here.

24:44.362 --> 24:47.352
It's like that, is it?
Shove your fucking baby!

24:48.173 --> 24:49.484
Satan!

24:53.370 --> 24:54.867
Isn't she beautiful?

24:56.170 --> 24:57.477
Perfect.

25:01.448 --> 25:04.047
Doesn't matter that she's
born into this shithole.

25:05.085 --> 25:07.898
That's just physical,
that's easy to change.

25:08.570 --> 25:10.758
But her spiritual well-being,
you with me?

25:12.304 --> 25:13.664
Get your own place.

25:14.436 --> 25:18.435
Keep her sheltered, clean, fed,
watered. Y'know, all the basics.

25:19.700 --> 25:21.844
Maybe even get her
some nice jewellery.

25:22.551 --> 25:23.969
No piercings, mind.

25:26.728 --> 25:28.023
But most of all...

25:30.279 --> 25:34.016
just love her.
With all your heart.

25:35.951 --> 25:37.230
She'll feel it.

25:37.490 --> 25:42.203
She'll know, and when she's older,
understands more...

25:44.010 --> 25:46.169
she'll draw strength
from that love.

25:46.701 --> 25:52.875
Your love will empower her.
One day, all this will be yours.

26:00.078 --> 26:01.385
Liz?

26:03.861 --> 26:05.166
What's wrong?

26:07.040 --> 26:08.353
Liz?!

26:09.288 --> 26:10.603
Help!

26:10.690 --> 26:11.892
WAILING

26:11.909 --> 26:14.416
Liz! Wake up!

26:20.963 --> 26:22.330
Oh, fuck.

26:23.743 --> 26:25.095
Fuck!

26:27.810 --> 26:29.728
Oh, no way!

26:36.217 --> 26:37.627
Why aren't you at school?

26:39.450 --> 26:40.916
You look worse than I feel.

26:50.119 --> 26:52.186
How's Mrs Sporritt
coping with you lot?

26:52.648 --> 26:53.967
Not been in.

26:54.491 --> 26:55.791
(TUTS)

26:58.050 --> 26:59.369
You haven't told the police?

26:59.851 --> 27:01.392
That's none of your business.

27:05.365 --> 27:06.964
I wish I'd done something.

27:07.012 --> 27:11.705
Tragically, bystander apathy
seems endemic in modern society.

27:12.182 --> 27:13.533
Why didn't you report it?

27:14.500 --> 27:15.978
Won't that get you in trouble?

27:18.405 --> 27:19.752
As I thought.

27:26.292 --> 27:30.291
It doesn't matter anyway.
I've burned the clothes...

27:31.717 --> 27:35.275
scrubbed his spit
till my skin was raw.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.408
Scraped his scalp
out of my fingernails.

27:40.970 --> 27:44.002
There isn't a trace of his DNA
anywhere near me.

27:45.644 --> 27:46.963
I'm sorry.

27:53.432 --> 27:55.025
You should go.

28:11.250 --> 28:12.729
Where the fuck have you been?

28:12.769 --> 28:15.432
Welcome to the jungle!

28:18.454 --> 28:19.877
What's this for?

28:19.894 --> 28:21.221
Smackhead Stuart.

28:21.250 --> 28:23.143
Ahh, baby done good.

28:24.570 --> 28:26.089
Finally grown a pair then?

28:26.090 --> 28:29.322
Oh, bullying the weak
and vulnerable? Piece of piss.

28:30.077 --> 28:31.316
You got tummyache?

28:31.450 --> 28:33.330
No, why do you have to be
so suspicious?

28:35.205 --> 28:37.208
Are you going to tell me
what's going on?

28:37.239 --> 28:39.416
Look, can't I just fancy
some cornflakes?

28:43.565 --> 28:44.869
(FORCED LAUGHTER)

28:44.900 --> 28:46.283
(CLEARS THROAT)

28:50.986 --> 28:52.289
This is going to be interesting.

28:52.290 --> 28:53.783
Jasmine must be hungry.

28:54.506 --> 28:55.807
Aww!

29:15.210 --> 29:16.569
Leave it out, Lillian.

29:16.570 --> 29:18.649
You know the new rules.

29:18.650 --> 29:19.689
Did he complain?

29:19.690 --> 29:21.449
No drink and drugs at work.
I won't have it.

29:21.450 --> 29:23.729
No, he didn't complain.

29:23.730 --> 29:26.769
He made me shove that
up his ring piece once we'd finished.

29:26.770 --> 29:28.769
A nifty manoeuvre,
earned us another?10.

29:28.770 --> 29:30.775
I do not have a liquor licence.

29:30.923 --> 29:34.442
Running a brothel's illegal anyway,
you mental bitch!

29:34.631 --> 29:37.635
Who are you calling an illegal?
I can't risk it any more.

29:37.690 --> 29:39.275
So do something about it.

29:40.002 --> 29:41.321
I am.

29:41.603 --> 29:42.908
You're fired.

29:43.330 --> 29:45.329
You're going to sack
your best earner?

29:45.330 --> 29:47.689
Tilly took twice as much
as you last week.

29:47.690 --> 29:50.889
Do one, you boggle-eyed old twat.
Do you think I need you?

29:51.233 --> 29:52.542
Here we go.

29:56.810 --> 29:59.849
Never a good time for me to be
chatting with the odd lot, Carl.

29:59.850 --> 30:02.209
Your mate Brooksy's
a very unpopular man.

30:02.210 --> 30:03.249
Yeah?

30:03.956 --> 30:05.649
Not just the drugs and the money,

30:05.650 --> 30:09.009
not just bent as fuck, but reckon
he fancies himself with a knife.

30:09.807 --> 30:11.530
He's in the frame for
cutting up a prostitute

30:11.531 --> 30:13.253
in town, three-hundred-and-odd
stitches.

30:13.620 --> 30:17.619
Yeah, well, you lot specialise
in putting people in the frame.

30:18.210 --> 30:19.609
Doesn't mean he did it.

30:19.610 --> 30:22.969
He did it, mate. His own partner's
giving evidence against.

30:22.970 --> 30:24.597
So do your job and nick him.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.289
Dangerous man to have in your pub.

30:27.290 --> 30:29.308
I don't appreciate a veto on who
I can serve.

30:34.890 --> 30:37.449
Brooksy's trouble.
You've got to cut him loose.

30:37.450 --> 30:40.011
I can't. I just can't.

30:46.610 --> 30:49.529
Some sixth sense told me
not to throw these away.

30:49.530 --> 30:53.152
Wythenshawe Park Fair, when Connor
stuck that candyfloss on her head.

30:53.224 --> 30:55.628
Gave her more hair
than she already had.

30:56.728 --> 30:58.034
Awww!

30:58.050 --> 31:01.339
Knowsley. Them Scousers
let their kids sit on the car roof.

31:01.566 --> 31:03.519
Er, we all did it.

31:04.212 --> 31:08.972
Doesn't make it right.
She's not going back to that junkie.

31:11.130 --> 31:13.175
Stuart won't hang about
in that flat.

31:13.352 --> 31:16.488
Once the bizzies find that dead body
they'll be on the hunt for him.

31:20.170 --> 31:21.729
What's stopping
you from keeping her?

31:22.018 --> 31:24.097
- Me?!
- You'd make a great dad.

31:25.050 --> 31:26.387
That's what Liz said.

31:27.709 --> 31:29.434
Might be the only chance you get.

31:33.245 --> 31:34.832
Aw, ha ha!

31:36.542 --> 31:38.461
Bonfire night, Jockey.

31:38.789 --> 31:40.309
(BOTH) Toffee apple!

31:40.695 --> 31:42.000
Awww.

31:58.930 --> 32:00.383
Brooksy?

32:02.490 --> 32:03.689
Go on.

32:03.690 --> 32:05.489
He wants me to have a word
with someone.

32:05.490 --> 32:06.849
What kind of word?

32:06.850 --> 32:08.049
Just scare them.

32:08.050 --> 32:10.187
So do it himself. He scares me.

32:12.700 --> 32:14.093
Who is it?

32:14.527 --> 32:15.835
His son-in-law.

32:15.992 --> 32:17.296
Another villain?

32:17.330 --> 32:18.640
Straight-goer.

32:19.085 --> 32:20.689
So now you're bullying civilians?

32:21.478 --> 32:24.225
This guy isn't a nice man.
Don't worry about him.

32:27.875 --> 32:31.068
We've been here before.
You don't have to do this.

32:31.410 --> 32:32.733
What choice is there?

32:53.250 --> 32:54.777
(SIGHS)

32:55.530 --> 32:57.049
I'll be a witness.

32:57.324 --> 32:58.636
It's barely dawn.

32:58.676 --> 33:00.629
I don't care what happens to me.
I'll be a witness.

33:05.170 --> 33:08.699
You get labelled a grass
in Chatsworth, you'll be an outcast.

33:08.910 --> 33:10.519
Grassing on rapists doesn't count.

33:10.543 --> 33:14.105
Oh, ho ho! I doubt Frasier Kane
will see it that way.

33:15.506 --> 33:16.808
He doesn't scare me.

33:17.319 --> 33:19.136
Oh! Oh, so now you'll
stand up to him?

33:22.235 --> 33:23.894
You want to do something for me?

33:24.231 --> 33:25.750
Yeah. Anything.

33:25.970 --> 33:29.969
Right. Start getting up
in the morning, shower,

33:30.668 --> 33:33.004
make yourself presentable,
go back to school.

33:36.610 --> 33:38.418
He's been asking about my mate,
Letitia.

33:38.581 --> 33:39.964
What if he does it again?

33:41.870 --> 33:45.869
Well... it won't be to me.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.511
Careful, or you'll draw blood.

33:59.676 --> 34:02.386
What's the emergency?
Finally realised I'm irresistible?

34:02.823 --> 34:05.707
Another time, Carl.
This is important.

34:07.167 --> 34:09.440
Your lot want this Brooksy
character, yeah?

34:11.303 --> 34:14.847
I can give him yer.
But I need something in return.

34:15.275 --> 34:18.581
Brooksy may or may not
have historic evidence

34:18.690 --> 34:20.629
from an incident a long time ago.

34:21.411 --> 34:24.534
He may or may not
have Jamie over a barrel.

34:24.591 --> 34:26.510
So, what do you want me to do?

34:26.730 --> 34:28.569
I need you to check this guy out.

34:29.460 --> 34:32.831
Here's an address. He wants Jamie
to do the bloke real harm.

34:33.129 --> 34:34.449
Oh, shit.

34:34.449 --> 34:37.009
Please, Carl. I'm worried.

34:37.010 --> 34:38.362
KNOCKING AT DOOR

34:47.452 --> 34:48.811
Yes?

34:48.867 --> 34:51.346
Hello. Is Aidan in?

34:51.409 --> 34:52.929
And you are?

34:53.170 --> 34:54.972
Sorry, I'm his teacher.

34:55.003 --> 34:57.902
As far as we know, he leaves here,
he goes in every day.

34:57.967 --> 35:00.011
We won't be paying any fines.

35:02.955 --> 35:04.269
Please?

35:13.386 --> 35:14.690
Now?

35:14.737 --> 35:16.043
Now.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.675
Please, don't.

35:19.678 --> 35:21.097
Do you want to be a prison widow?

35:30.638 --> 35:32.535
Don't do this.

35:35.879 --> 35:37.249
I won't be long,

35:37.250 --> 35:38.543
and then it's done.

35:50.355 --> 35:52.109
I'm worried they won't believe me.

35:52.110 --> 35:54.749
Police attitudes have always
been a disgrace.

35:54.750 --> 35:58.730
Back in the '70S, every one of
us was an IRA suspect.

35:59.176 --> 36:01.029
Muslims don't know they're born...

36:01.030 --> 36:02.229
I say get over yourself.

36:02.878 --> 36:05.877
It's a tough old world... report it
and move on.

36:05.980 --> 36:08.558
You do none of us any favours
making yourself a victim.

36:08.610 --> 36:10.465
She's a teacher, not a hooker.

36:11.235 --> 36:12.621
By "us" I meant women...

36:13.590 --> 36:15.869
but thanks all the same
for reminding me of me station.

36:15.933 --> 36:18.246
Oh, I didn't...

36:20.830 --> 36:24.109
I accuse Aidan of standing by and
I know it makes me a hypocrite.

36:24.110 --> 36:26.418
You don't have to explain
yourself to us.

36:27.277 --> 36:28.699
I'm not brave.

36:30.254 --> 36:31.562
I'm sorry.

36:31.594 --> 36:33.513
Don't apologise to that
little shite.

36:33.608 --> 36:34.918
Aidan?

36:54.154 --> 36:55.682
Jesus!

36:58.270 --> 36:59.989
Are you taking the piss?

37:00.538 --> 37:01.589
It's what you smoked.

37:01.606 --> 37:02.645
Cow shit?

37:02.670 --> 37:05.452
Kanda, Indian cow shit.

37:06.046 --> 37:09.109
But I mean, how different
can our cows' arseholes be?

37:09.110 --> 37:13.109
Are you telling me my bird is
a nymphomaniac because of cow shit?

37:13.342 --> 37:15.981
There's loads getting on it over
there, cheap as fuck.

37:17.351 --> 37:18.829
I'm not sure this is dry enough.

37:18.830 --> 37:20.015
This one is.

37:22.012 --> 37:23.749
Think how much of that is out there.

37:27.203 --> 37:29.030
An endless supply.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.476
(GAGS)

37:36.589 --> 37:38.491
Well, is it anything
like the last lot?

37:40.590 --> 37:41.829
Hanging.

37:41.883 --> 37:43.694
Maybe the girls'll still
be mad for it?

37:43.945 --> 37:45.328
Chesney?

37:52.550 --> 37:54.905
Nice but unusual.

38:03.350 --> 38:04.952
What are you two doing later?

38:07.085 --> 38:09.149
Well... what are you thinking?

38:09.150 --> 38:11.949
I'm torn between a tuna baguette...

38:13.449 --> 38:17.448
or being the filling in a
Hovis and soda bread sandwich.

38:26.332 --> 38:27.637
(CLEARS THROAT)

38:27.858 --> 38:29.169
Oh.

38:30.270 --> 38:33.012
That's the best sleep I've
had in a long time.

38:35.524 --> 38:37.137
Your fish and chips
will go cold.

39:00.630 --> 39:04.629
PHONE RINGS

39:11.110 --> 39:14.309
What's this about?
Please, for fuck's sake don't.

39:14.310 --> 39:17.629
That's work checking where I am.
I'm due on a shift.

39:19.012 --> 39:20.993
I'm under a Protection Order,

39:21.080 --> 39:23.637
if I don't answer,
they'll be all over the shop.

39:25.070 --> 39:29.069
PHONE CONTINUES TO RING

39:32.504 --> 39:35.063
Answer it... and behave,

39:35.134 --> 39:37.567
or I'll rip your throat
from ear to fucking ear.

39:40.630 --> 39:43.020
Hello? It's for you.

39:46.710 --> 39:48.549
Jamie, he's a police officer.

39:48.550 --> 39:50.709
His name is Philip Ryan.

39:50.802 --> 39:52.452
He's never been married to Brooks'
daughter,

39:52.497 --> 39:54.096
probably never even met her.

39:55.082 --> 39:56.858
The picture Brooks showed you

39:56.959 --> 39:59.116
is the prostitute he's
being charged with cutting up.

39:59.906 --> 40:02.952
He's trying to make you a cop
killer. Jamie?

40:03.910 --> 40:05.679
Say his name, Jamie!

40:06.788 --> 40:08.229
Say it, Jamie!

40:09.151 --> 40:10.546
Philip.

40:24.230 --> 40:26.225
This is my mate, Carl. He's a cop.

40:26.702 --> 40:28.010
Policeman.

40:28.049 --> 40:29.350
Pleased to meet you.

40:37.035 --> 40:39.405
I could have the Support Officer
here before we start the ice cream.

40:45.954 --> 40:47.285
Will he get in trouble?

40:49.781 --> 40:51.543
Depends, but probably.

40:52.465 --> 40:53.941
It's not about me.

40:53.996 --> 40:55.418
No, too right, it's not.

40:59.277 --> 41:00.652
You still want to do this?

41:02.965 --> 41:04.276
Yeah.

41:04.317 --> 41:05.684
And we can do it here?

41:07.804 --> 41:09.113
It's the right thing to do.

41:13.996 --> 41:15.305
OK.

41:15.329 --> 41:16.821
About fucking time.

41:22.258 --> 41:23.571
Thanks.

41:35.435 --> 41:37.071
Summer Scott. 3.30.

41:37.093 --> 41:38.399

Yeah, if they'd flashing blue
lights round their neck

41:56.124 --> 41:58.602
they wouldn't stand out any more.

41:58.973 --> 42:02.405
There's no scream going up about the
cunt I asked you to take care of?

42:05.090 --> 42:06.397
I didn't do it.

42:09.209 --> 42:10.728
Tell me you didn't call them?

42:11.072 --> 42:12.303
Karen.

42:13.949 --> 42:15.228
But you let her?

42:15.682 --> 42:19.051
She's a strong woman, family minded.

42:19.289 --> 42:22.801
Get in there, Red Army! 10-1!

42:28.870 --> 42:31.067
So, they're just keeping an eye?

42:31.128 --> 42:32.840
As far as I know, yeah.

42:32.950 --> 42:34.309
You know what happens now.

42:35.722 --> 42:37.172
It doesn't have to be like that.

42:37.243 --> 42:38.637
I'm in a corner, kid.

42:52.070 --> 42:53.489
No hard feelings?

43:05.830 --> 43:09.829
No! Jamie!

43:10.430 --> 43:12.269
Jamie!

43:12.270 --> 43:15.229
Jamie!

43:15.230 --> 43:17.669
You two were supposed to protect
him!

43:17.670 --> 43:19.097
Jamie!

43:25.824 --> 43:29.349
We'll meet again, kid,
nothing surer.

43:35.615 --> 43:38.011
Jay, about the other stuff...

43:38.889 --> 43:40.347
it's been sorted.

43:40.623 --> 43:43.769
It'll never see the light of day.
You're safe.
