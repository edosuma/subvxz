WEBVTT

00:03.040 --> 00:04.640
Stand and deliver, coachman!

00:04.720 --> 00:07.400
Hand me that musket
or I'll blow your brains out!

00:07.480 --> 00:11.720
Very well, coachman. You were warned.
Now prepare to meet thy maker.

00:12.480 --> 00:13.680
Bang!

00:13.760 --> 00:16.840
Lord Woolford, I'll give you three seconds
to open the carriage door

00:16.920 --> 00:18.280
or I'll smash the glass.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.040
Sma--

00:24.600 --> 00:25.680
Smash!

00:25.760 --> 00:27.760
-I warned you, Lord Woolford!
-Whack!

00:27.840 --> 00:29.320
-That's great, Ray.
-Thanks, Danny.

00:29.400 --> 00:32.439
-Why am I doing sound effects?
-Just following the client's instructions.

00:32.520 --> 00:35.360
Here we go, one minute into the job,
Toast starts complaining. [laughs]

00:35.440 --> 00:38.040
You've got a script. Quit your bellyaching
and be professional!

00:38.120 --> 00:40.000
Fuck off! It's just me saying the words!

00:40.080 --> 00:42.880
-Hi, Steven. I'm Clem Fandango.
-I know who you are.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.600
It's just me saying the words. Why?

00:44.680 --> 00:47.960
Well, in the script, it's indicated
at various places, so for instance...

00:48.040 --> 00:50.280
"During the robbery,
we need the sound of a bang."

00:50.360 --> 00:52.680
Well, then use the sound
of a real gunshot!

00:52.760 --> 00:54.040
Not just me saying "bang!"

00:54.120 --> 00:57.000
And later on here it says, "honk!"

00:57.080 --> 00:58.080
Sound of a horn, yeah.

00:58.160 --> 01:02.040
Well, "honk" doesn't sound like a horn,
it just sounds like a fella going, "Honk!"

01:02.120 --> 01:04.840
Might have something to help you there.

01:06.680 --> 01:07.720
Good call, Danny.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.280
-Thanks.
-Cheers.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.840
-[door closes]
-Alright, Steven. In your own time.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.200
In your own time.

01:16.040 --> 01:19.600
-[honk]
-That's great, Steven.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.120
[honk]

01:21.200 --> 01:22.520
[Danny] Keep going.

01:22.600 --> 01:27.520
[honking]

01:27.600 --> 01:30.320
[honking continues]

01:57.880 --> 01:59.560
Ah, Ormond. How are you?

01:59.640 --> 02:03.160
[laughs] Mighty glad to be getting out
of this place, I can tell you, Ed.

02:03.240 --> 02:06.480
-Ah, Toast, you're here too.
-Alright, old chap? Are you ready?

02:07.040 --> 02:11.280
Thanks for collecting me, you two.
Loyal friends. Loyal friends.

02:11.360 --> 02:14.160
We'll have you safely back
in your cozy flat in a couple of hours.

02:14.240 --> 02:16.000
Terrific.

02:16.840 --> 02:20.280
I wonder if we might just stop off
down the road.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.400
There's a delightful looking
old country pub

02:22.480 --> 02:24.760
that I saw from the ambulance
on the way here.

02:24.840 --> 02:25.880
Is that wise, Ormond?

02:25.960 --> 02:28.880
You've just spent three months in rehab
for chronic alcoholism.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.520
[laughs] Oh, nonsense!
I'm completely cured now.

02:32.600 --> 02:36.120
One little snifter's hardly gonna make
any difference. [laughs]

02:36.200 --> 02:38.520
What do you think, Toast?

02:38.600 --> 02:40.840
Alright, but just the one, though.

02:46.080 --> 02:49.200
What the hell do you know
about the theater?

02:49.280 --> 02:55.400
[slurs] I was treading the boards and
powdering my face when your mother

02:55.480 --> 02:58.200
was powdering your arse!

03:01.880 --> 03:03.040
A bit of a slip-up.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.760
-[Ed] Ah, Ormond. How are you?
-[Ormond laughs]

03:06.840 --> 03:09.440
[Ormond] Mightily glad to be
out of this place, Ed, I can tell you.

03:09.960 --> 03:12.120
Thanks for collecting me, you two.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.840
Loyal friends. Loyal friends.

03:14.920 --> 03:18.040
We'll have you safely back
in your cozy flat in a couple of hours.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.880
I wonder if we might just stop off--

03:20.960 --> 03:22.880
Now remember what happened last time,
Ormond?

03:22.960 --> 03:24.720
We went to that pub, you got wildly drunk

03:24.800 --> 03:27.280
and we had to immediately drop you off
back in rehab.

03:27.360 --> 03:31.600
[laughs] Come on, boys.
It's hardly likely to happen again, is it?

03:33.480 --> 03:36.720
Have I seen  Shopping and Fucking?

03:37.320 --> 03:41.760
Somebody actually called their play
Shopping and Fuck...

03:41.840 --> 03:45.040
We are teetering on the eve of Sodom

03:45.120 --> 03:48.480
and you tell me that this is progress?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.480
[Jane] Honestly, Toast!

03:55.560 --> 04:01.120
I gave you strict, simple instructions
to take him home, but no!

04:01.200 --> 04:05.880
You had the great idea of
transporting a recovering alcoholic

04:05.960 --> 04:09.000
straight from rehab to the pub!

04:09.080 --> 04:11.040
Seven times!

04:11.120 --> 04:13.240
Jane, you don't know
how persuasive he can be.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.720
Just the one, he said.

04:14.800 --> 04:19.279
They all say that, you cretin!
This always happens when he's not working.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.240
Luckily, when he comes out
in three months' time,

04:22.320 --> 04:25.240
I've got him a job in
Man of Sex  at the Playhouse.

04:25.320 --> 04:28.400
Man of Sex?  Isn't that the play
I'm doing with Ray bloody Purchase?

04:28.480 --> 04:30.440
Yes. And you both
can keep an eye on Ormond

04:30.520 --> 04:32.640
and make sure he stays off the sauce!

04:32.720 --> 04:34.720
Well, luckily, he's hardly in it.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.640
Ah, yes!

04:37.720 --> 04:41.040
Why did you say, "Ah, yes"
to me like that, Jane?

04:41.120 --> 04:44.920
Sorry, I should have been looking for a
piece of paper on my desk shouldn't it?

04:45.000 --> 04:49.040
-[groans]
-Now... Ah, yes!

04:49.120 --> 04:51.200
-Well, what is it?
-Well, this might interest you.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.640
-Your ex-wife Ellen...
-My ex-wife Ellen...

04:53.720 --> 04:55.320
She's about to publish a book.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.920
What kind of book? Is it fiction?
Jilly Cooper-type of thing?

04:58.000 --> 05:00.920
-No, not fiction. Autobiography I imagine.
-Oh, God!

05:01.000 --> 05:03.680
Obviously you were married to her
for 12 years.

05:03.760 --> 05:06.120
-Anything we need to be worried about?
-[scoffs]

05:06.200 --> 05:09.280
Any skeletons in your cupboard
she's likely to uncover?

05:09.360 --> 05:13.400
Well, she's bound to mention me a lot,
and it won't be entirely flattering.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.040
-When did you last see her?
-About a year ago.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.400
No, Ellen!

05:17.480 --> 05:21.440
If you wanna gain entrance to the house,
you'll have to go through your lawyers.

05:21.520 --> 05:25.000
-[Ellen] Out of my way, Toast!
-No, Ellen, I'm standing firm.

05:25.720 --> 05:29.600
Don't ever tell me

05:29.680 --> 05:31.000
-what to do!
-[crunching]

05:31.080 --> 05:33.280
-Ooh! [laughs]
-[Toast groans]

05:40.080 --> 05:42.240
[laughs] Funny! Funny stuff!

05:42.320 --> 05:46.160
No, it wasn't, Jane!
I was in tremendous pain.

05:46.240 --> 05:49.560
Anyway, I'm off up the hill
to Bedfordshire. Literally.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.320
Bedfordshire. Isn't that where
your new girlfriend lives?

05:52.400 --> 05:54.280
Yes, it is.

05:54.360 --> 05:55.760
The drummer lady?

05:55.840 --> 05:59.560
Varrity Map.
She happens to be a doctor of drumming.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.880
I didn't know you could be
a doctor of drumming.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.120
Well, you can,
if you're very good at the drumming.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.400
-Fascinating.
-It is fascinating.

06:06.480 --> 06:10.000
I'm gonna see her gaff for the first time.
She's promised to cook for me.

06:10.080 --> 06:14.040
Lucky Toast. Ooofff!

06:18.000 --> 06:19.720
[drumming]

06:25.400 --> 06:27.200
[mimics knocking at door]

06:31.320 --> 06:33.800
[drumming continues]

06:37.360 --> 06:40.560
-[drumming stops]
-[doorbell chimes]

06:41.320 --> 06:43.120
[mimics doorbell]

06:45.960 --> 06:47.720
[phone rings]

06:52.440 --> 06:53.880
[mimics phone]

06:55.240 --> 06:56.360
[sighs]

06:58.320 --> 06:59.760
[sighs]

07:07.800 --> 07:09.480
[mimics tapping on window]

07:13.800 --> 07:16.960
Ah, Toast! There you are!

07:17.040 --> 07:19.640
-Come in, it's open.
-[drum flourish]

07:22.040 --> 07:24.400
Welcome to  chez moi.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.080
It's quite a lot of drums, Varrity.

07:26.160 --> 07:30.080
Yes, well, I'm rehearsing a piece
for the symphony orchestra,

07:30.160 --> 07:35.360
so I'm very much in the zone.
So, what do you wanna do?

07:35.440 --> 07:38.040
Well, I'm starving.
You said you were gonna cook me something.

07:38.880 --> 07:41.080
Yes, I did, didn't I?

07:41.160 --> 07:43.360
-Yes, you did.
-[drumming]

07:43.440 --> 07:48.120
-Pour me a glass, Toast.
-Red, white or rosé?

07:48.200 --> 07:50.440
-Why not open all three?
-Yeah!

07:50.520 --> 07:51.720
[Varrity laughs]

07:51.800 --> 07:54.920
-[Toast strains]
-[pop]

07:55.840 --> 07:57.160
-[strains]
-[pop]

07:58.720 --> 07:59.720
[sighs]

08:00.280 --> 08:02.000
-[strains]
-[pop]

08:03.440 --> 08:04.800
[groans]

08:04.880 --> 08:08.440
Jesus Christ, woman? [exhales]

08:09.480 --> 08:14.280
Supremely talented and very much in demand
for her skills. She's a great gal.

08:14.360 --> 08:18.080
Her grandfather was quite famous,
you know. Frank Forfolk.

08:18.160 --> 08:21.480
Round-the-world yachtsman.
I have his autobiography.  Forfolk's Sake.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.160
-You must remember it.
-No, I don't.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.680
Oh, you must remember it!
Forfolk's Sake.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.240
No, I don't.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.560
[Ed] That's what it's called.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.480
Ah, yes!

08:32.039 --> 08:34.159
So, how long have you two been
stepping out, now?

08:34.240 --> 08:35.360
Three months.

08:35.440 --> 08:39.039
And I can honestly say, I hardly notice
her incessant drumming anymore.

08:39.120 --> 08:43.200
And is this syncopation matched by
her rhythmic gyrations in the bedroom?

08:43.280 --> 08:48.240
Let's just say we're very much in sync
when it comes to the art of lovemaking.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.600
What the hell is that?

08:52.680 --> 08:55.960
Oh, it's a charity calendar.
Produced by  Healthy Man Monthly.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.560
It's a chap's doodah.

08:57.640 --> 09:02.000
Yes, 12 male celebrities agreed to have
their privates photographed.

09:02.080 --> 09:05.960
This one is... let me see, uh...
Ah, it's Gyles Brandreth.

09:06.040 --> 09:09.920
[groans] Who else is in there?

09:10.000 --> 09:14.640
[Ed] Prince Charles, Ian Hislop,
John Bishop...

09:14.720 --> 09:15.720
Who?

09:15.800 --> 09:18.400
-[Ed] The Archbishop of Canterbury.
-That's enough.

09:18.480 --> 09:21.680
Bit squeamish, Toast? It's no different
to  Calendar Girls,  remember?

09:21.760 --> 09:25.120
Calendar Girls
was just mild, twee vulgarity.

09:25.200 --> 09:29.440
That, however,
is a different box of skittles.

09:29.520 --> 09:33.600
I mean, it's enough to put a chap
off his boiled egg.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.520
It's all for a good cause.

09:35.600 --> 09:41.240
Thing is, Ed, I've never actually seen
another chap's... in the flesh, like.

09:41.320 --> 09:42.280
-No?
-No.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.280
Oh, I have. Several hundred.

09:44.360 --> 09:46.960
But that's mostly because
I used to work a lot with Trevor Nunn.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.440
-Oh.
-Simon Callow.

09:49.520 --> 09:53.040
Oh yes, I recognize that one
from  A Room with a View.

09:53.120 --> 09:56.720
Yeah, I don't think I'd like to see one
in the flesh, though.

09:56.800 --> 09:57.920
I don't know how I'd react.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.240
Don't worry, Toast.
It'll probably never happen.

10:01.320 --> 10:02.960
[groans]

10:04.680 --> 10:07.920
[laughs] That is fantastic!

10:08.000 --> 10:11.400
-Yeah, I picked it up at Alicante Airport.
-[laughs]

10:11.480 --> 10:12.920
As I was coming up the stairs,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.640
I could have sworn I heard the voice
of Bill bloody Purchase.

10:16.720 --> 10:22.040
The ever-so-slightly-more-intelligent
albino twin of Ray bloody Purchase.

10:22.120 --> 10:25.520
Is that you, Toast?
I was wondering if you'd drop in.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.360
How come you're back in London?

10:27.440 --> 10:30.040
Run out of old dears to rip off
on the Costa Del Crime?

10:30.120 --> 10:34.240
[laughs] Same old Toast.
Always the charmer.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.920
[Jane] Toast, come and look at this.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.520
-Bill Purchase brought me back a present.
-What is it?

10:39.600 --> 10:45.080
Come and have a look at the donkey.
Get as close as you can to its rear end.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.440
-What, like this?
-Yes.

10:46.520 --> 10:47.680
-[fart]
-[groans]

10:47.760 --> 10:49.240
[Jane and Bill laugh]

10:49.320 --> 10:52.680
-[Jane] Isn't that hilarious?
-It's real shit as well.

10:52.760 --> 10:55.200
-It better bloody not be.
-[chuckles]

10:55.280 --> 10:58.640
-By the way, how's your ex-wife?
-You what?

10:58.720 --> 11:02.120
I heard she's about to spill the beans
in a new book.

11:02.200 --> 11:05.720
Who knows what she'll reveal?
Getting nervous, Toast?

11:05.800 --> 11:07.320
Why don't you bugger off?

11:07.400 --> 11:11.400
[laughs] Don't be like that, old chap.
Although I probably should.

11:11.480 --> 11:14.800
I'm going to meet my brother,
Ray Purchase, at The Colonial.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.080
Ta-ta for now.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.400
Ciao.

11:19.160 --> 11:21.240
Why the hell did you let him in, Jane?

11:21.320 --> 11:24.520
He's keen to get back into something
in the West End.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.960
I suspect he's "on the run" again.

11:27.040 --> 11:30.280
Bad enough having to swerve around
one idiot Purchase

11:30.360 --> 11:32.200
without throwing another one into the mix.

11:32.280 --> 11:35.200
You're unhappy with your Purchases.
[laughs]

11:35.280 --> 11:37.400
-You what?
-[laughs]

11:37.480 --> 11:39.040
[Toast] What a pair!

11:39.120 --> 11:41.480
A clueless halfwit and a con man.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.920
Didn't you and Bill Purchase
once do a play together?

11:44.000 --> 11:47.440
Yeah, always playing childish pranks
on other actors.

11:47.520 --> 11:48.720
He's well known for it.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.360
Speaking of plays,
how are rehearsals going for  Man of Sex?

11:51.440 --> 11:53.680
Amazingly,
Ormond has remained totally sober.

11:53.760 --> 11:56.680
As I said,
as long as he's working, he's fine.

11:56.760 --> 12:00.240
-Fingers crossed for opening night.
-[sighs]

12:02.840 --> 12:07.200
-[Toast] And I truly am a man of sex.
-[applause]

12:07.280 --> 12:12.040
[laughs] Champagne, Ian, please.

12:12.120 --> 12:17.040
Well, I think for an opening night,
that went rather well.

12:17.120 --> 12:20.480
[whispers] Would you put that
on Toast's tab? Bless you, Ian.

12:20.560 --> 12:22.680
I'd lose the Welsh accent.
It's clearly not working.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.240
-I wasn't doing a...
-[laughs]

12:24.320 --> 12:27.800
-Piss off, Purchase!
-Come on, boys, let's not argue.

12:27.880 --> 12:32.560
Time for a tiny celebration
before the reviews come in.

12:33.480 --> 12:37.600
[gasps] Jill Quear was outstanding!
Is she coming along?

12:37.680 --> 12:41.320
-I saw her putting Ormond in his taxi.
-Oh good, he's being sensible.

12:41.400 --> 12:45.200
And he's promised
to have that George Best operation.

12:45.280 --> 12:50.240
You know the one? It makes you physically
sick if alcohol enters your bloodstream.

12:50.320 --> 12:54.680
Did it work for George?
I think it did! Ha!

12:54.760 --> 12:57.720
Just, uh... nip to the lady loo.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.880
[Ormond] It's hardly likely
to happen again, is it?

12:59.960 --> 13:02.640
[Jill] Ormond, no! Your taxi!

13:02.720 --> 13:04.880
No, no, no, Ormond.
You need to go home.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.520
Oh, come on.
Just one little drink won't do any harm.

13:07.600 --> 13:10.440
[laughs] It is an opening night,
after all.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.040
Just a tiny, weeny little Scotchlet.

13:13.120 --> 13:16.160
Alright, Toast? What d'you say?

13:16.240 --> 13:17.440
Well, alright. Just the one.

13:17.520 --> 13:21.720
-[laughs] Cheers!
-[all] Cheers!

13:22.600 --> 13:25.920
Jane, it's not my fault.
He said he'd just have the one.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.640
He's a chronic alcoholic, Toast.

13:28.720 --> 13:32.040
He now has to go into hospital
to have that George Best operation.

13:32.120 --> 13:36.640
So,  Man of Sex  are an actor short
because Sacker is back on the booze!

13:36.720 --> 13:39.560
So, I've been onto production
and I've contacted a few people.

13:39.640 --> 13:41.440
-Who?
-Baz Ravish.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.160
-He's good.
-Tony Excalibur.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.680
-Good.
-Champion House.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.160
-I think he's dead.
-Cocka Boo.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.000
-Great dancer.
-Michael Prance.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.680
-Still in jail, I think.
-Church Weaver.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.720
-Very good.
-And Heathcoat Pursuit.

13:52.800 --> 13:55.800
Wanker, but very good.
Are any of these available?

13:55.880 --> 13:58.560
-No. I'll ring around a few more.
-[drumming in background]

13:58.640 --> 14:02.680
Varrity, it might be time to stop
the drumming, do you think?!

14:02.760 --> 14:06.600
-[phone rings]
-[sighs] Oh, God. Jane, what do you want?

14:06.680 --> 14:09.760
-I've found someone.
-Who?

14:11.040 --> 14:14.680
Bloody thrilled to be back on the boards
in this play, Toast.

14:14.760 --> 14:17.720
-No, no, no!
-Keeping it in the family, Toast.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.880
Brothers in arms.
It'll be superb to share the stage again.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.800
I jumped at the chance to step in
when Jane told me about it.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.480
Helps that I know the play backwards.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.720
We were in it together
when it first opened in Southampton.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.280
Your ex-wife's from Southampton,
isn't she, Toast?

14:31.360 --> 14:32.920
How the hell do you know that?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.640
[laughs] It was in her book.

14:34.720 --> 14:39.240
-Her book isn't out yet.
-Oh, uh, Jane must have told me, uh...

14:39.320 --> 14:44.000
Bill! Was it Bristol where you put a
tarantula in Simon Russell Beale's helmet?

14:44.080 --> 14:46.560
[laughs] Nottingham.
That put him off his Coriolanus.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.320
That's outrageous!

14:48.400 --> 14:50.720
And where did you do a shit
in Wendy Craig's muesli?

14:50.800 --> 14:53.400
Manchester.
She hardly knew the difference.

14:53.480 --> 14:55.800
[Ray and Bill laugh]

14:55.880 --> 14:58.400
Bill has a terrific sense of humor.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.400
If I caught an actor
doing anything like that,

15:01.480 --> 15:04.800
I'd make sure
he was given his bloody cards!

15:04.880 --> 15:07.840
Now, don't you get any ideas,
Bill Purchase!

15:07.920 --> 15:10.160
Calm down, Toast.
We all enjoy a joke.

15:10.240 --> 15:14.200
But at the end of the day, you'll find
I'm as professional as the next man.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.800
[Western-style music]

15:18.920 --> 15:20.080
[laughs]

15:21.120 --> 15:25.320

15:25.400 --> 15:27.560
[Ray laughs]

15:29.360 --> 15:31.720
[laughter echoes]

15:37.400 --> 15:40.360
[Bill] So, nice place you've got here.

15:40.440 --> 15:44.080
It may be bijou, but it suits us.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.440
[Jill] Darling,
I'm just going to show Rosemary around.

15:46.520 --> 15:48.600
Sure! Have fun.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.480
Who's the chap with the gong?

15:50.560 --> 15:52.600
That's a live sculpture.

15:52.680 --> 15:55.520
Stephanie saw it in New York
and she wanted it.

15:55.600 --> 16:00.040
Whatever Stephanie wants, Stephanie gets.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.520
Can I be direct, Cyril?

16:01.600 --> 16:02.800
[Toast] Go ahead.

16:02.880 --> 16:06.640
It's Rosemary.
She's been reading your novel.

16:06.720 --> 16:09.600
-What's it called again?
-Man of Sex.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.840
She's getting all kinds of ideas.

16:11.920 --> 16:15.440
If Rosemary wants
to spread her sexual wings,

16:15.520 --> 16:17.440
maybe you should let her fly.

16:17.520 --> 16:21.720
Don't blame me, Richard.
I just wrote the book.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.160
-I should phone my father.
-Of course.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.000
See if he's caught his train.

16:35.280 --> 16:36.600
[laughs]

16:41.960 --> 16:45.400
Don't think I haven't noticed the way
Rosemary's been looking at you.

16:45.480 --> 16:48.080
It's because of that bloody book.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.680
[Toast] I can't stop people
from reading my book.

16:51.760 --> 16:55.360
You need to stop drinking champagne.
Makes you imagine things.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.400
The way I imagined your affair
with Louise?

17:01.040 --> 17:04.359
-Anyone seen Rosemary?
-[Toast sighs]

17:05.200 --> 17:08.160
Of course you'd bring up Louise.

17:08.240 --> 17:11.000
You and your jealous rages.

17:11.079 --> 17:12.520
[quietly] Oh...

17:15.960 --> 17:18.800
-I've just been...
-[gasps]

17:18.880 --> 17:20.400
[whispers] Oh, my God.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.200
I've just been shortlisted
for the Booker Prize.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.079
How old was she?

17:30.000 --> 17:31.240
Nineteen?

17:32.160 --> 17:36.120
You stand there, with that ridiculous...

17:42.400 --> 17:44.360
You stand there...

17:49.920 --> 17:52.320
-[clicks his teeth]
-[Ray sniggers]

17:59.080 --> 17:59.920
[chuckles]

18:02.200 --> 18:03.600
[laughs]

18:03.680 --> 18:08.000
You stand there with that ridiculous pipe
in your mouth.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.280
Puffing away without a care in the world.

18:15.440 --> 18:17.200
[Toast] And then I had to put it
in my mouth.

18:17.280 --> 18:21.360
Just after it had been up his...
I'm gonna complain.

18:21.440 --> 18:23.760
And of course,
Ray Purchase is there cheering him on.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.880
At least things are going well
with you and Varrity.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.400
-[sighs]
-Aren't they?

18:28.480 --> 18:29.880
I mean she's a great gal,

18:29.960 --> 18:34.440
but the incessant drumming's
now really starting to get on my tits.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.640
-I may have to break it up.
-Oh, dear.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.600
She's very keen to see the play.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.880
So we're gonna drive to her cottage,
have sex,

18:40.960 --> 18:43.080
then drive straight back to London
and see the show.

18:43.160 --> 18:44.720
Ah, lovely.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.120
Maybe I'll finish it
after the performance.

18:47.200 --> 18:50.440
Thing is,
I'm no good at this breakup stuff.

18:50.520 --> 18:53.360
Not unless
I absolutely hate the person concerned.

18:53.440 --> 18:57.000
Ah, I see your ex-wife, Ellen,
is writing her autobiography.

18:57.080 --> 18:58.840
I wonder what she has to say about you.

18:58.920 --> 19:02.240
Well, we were married for 12 years.

19:02.320 --> 19:05.040
That's potentially
a lot of damaging ammunition.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.760
Oh, almost forgot.

19:06.840 --> 19:11.680
Time to change the month on
my  Healthy Man Monthly  calendar. April.

19:11.760 --> 19:13.720
-Michael Ball.
-Oh...

19:14.440 --> 19:16.720
-Appropriately.
-That means it's April Fools' Day.

19:16.800 --> 19:21.000
Which also means that Bill Purchase is
bound to play a particularly cruel prank.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.640
Better watch yourself then, Toast.
