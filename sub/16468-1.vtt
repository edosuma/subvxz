Zane, Zane, Zane. Wait, can
you hear this song right now?

00:20.121 --> 00:22.421
This is, like, my favorite song.
Zane, wait, hold on.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.023
Wait, shh, seriously.
I'm talking right now.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.657
Listen, can you hear the song?

00:25.659 --> 00:27.493
Can you hear...

00:27.495 --> 00:30.396
If you can hear it, you
should sing along with me.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.264
It'll be like a duet.
It's super romantic.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.801
- - Did you hear the song?

00:35.803 --> 00:38.270
You don't? Well, I think you
should like my singing.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.305
That's mean of you to say.

00:40.307 --> 00:42.341
Yeah, I know I got all the words wrong.
I've only heard it once,

00:42.343 --> 00:43.742
<i>but it's, like, the best.</i>

00:43.744 --> 00:46.512
No, shut up, I have a
really good voice.

00:46.514 --> 00:48.313
<i>Hey, Zane?
How do you spell</i>

00:48.315 --> 00:53.519
"antidisestablishment-
Arianism"?

00:53.521 --> 00:55.754
I'll never get over it.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.257
Because it was the sixth
worst day of my life.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.459
You've seen my list, okay?
I'm never gonna forget that.

01:00.461 --> 01:03.595
What the... turtle?
Holy...!

01:14.809 --> 01:18.811
Wow. So, this is your
big birthday surprise?

01:18.813 --> 01:21.280
Yep. You know, I think
my dad misunderstood

01:21.282 --> 01:23.682
when I told him I wanted
something "small and sporty."

01:23.684 --> 01:25.851
Yeah, well, it
definitely is small.

01:25.853 --> 01:28.320
You know, I had all these dreams

01:28.322 --> 01:30.422
of packing up the
trunk of my new car

01:30.424 --> 01:31.824
<i>and driving off to college,</i>

01:31.826 --> 01:34.159
independent and adventurous

01:34.161 --> 01:36.595
and in charge of my own destiny.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.298
Now I'm more likely to get
run over by a semi truck

01:39.300 --> 01:41.733
before I even hit the suburbs.

01:41.735 --> 01:44.770
Here, you could use this.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.239
Is there something
wrong with my hair?

01:47.241 --> 01:50.142
Uh, no, nope. I just think
you need a little touch-up.

01:50.144 --> 01:52.311
Oh, yep.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.813
Like, all up in there, yeah.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.648
<i>Okay, yeah you... it's better.
Much better.</i>

01:56.650 --> 01:58.350
- Oh!
- You look good.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.152
You know, the blue
is pretty, though.

02:00.154 --> 02:03.288
It's, like, good for your
skin tone, your eyes.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.623
I'm feeling it.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.226
- My eyes are brown, though.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

02:07.228 --> 02:08.827
- Uh-huh.
- <i>That was what I said.</i>

02:08.829 --> 02:10.262
- Okay.
- <i>Come on,</i> we're gonna be late.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.397
Okay.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.266
<i>Here's your brush.</i>

02:14.268 --> 02:16.568
Came out of nowhere, like
some kind of ninja turtle,

02:16.570 --> 02:18.437
which I think is where
they got the title from.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.606
Anyway, if it wasn't for
my fear of retribution

02:20.608 --> 02:23.809
from animal rights activists, I
would've just mowed the thing down,

02:23.811 --> 02:26.411
<i>but</i> I made the conscious
decision to, like,

02:26.413 --> 02:28.447
swerve out of the way
and save its life

02:28.449 --> 02:30.749
- because I'm a hero.
- Yeah.

02:30.751 --> 02:33.485
Well, they don't really go over the
whole turtle thing in driver's ed.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.187
They don't, which is
extremely upsetting to me,

02:35.189 --> 02:37.756
because it put a serious
dent in my dream

02:37.758 --> 02:40.159
to be a taxi driver-
slash-male model.

02:40.161 --> 02:41.793
Dude, that was
never gonna happen.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.229
- I couldn't be a taxi driver?
- No, I'm sorry.

02:44.231 --> 02:47.558
On the plus side, a scooter
is super easy to park.

02:47.583 --> 02:48.667
I guess so.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.170
- And it's environmentally friendly.
- True, that's good.

02:51.172 --> 02:53.639
And on the weekends, you can
make Chinese food deliveries.

02:53.641 --> 02:56.475
- Mmm, okay.
- Specifically to me.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.443
What...?

02:58.445 --> 03:01.613
As if my day wasn't bad enough.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.815
Where is that obnoxious weasel?

03:07.888 --> 03:11.890
I just don't understand why my
dad won't get me another car.

03:11.892 --> 03:15.227
It's every teenager's right
to have a car, okay?

03:15.229 --> 03:16.562
That's in the constitution.

03:16.564 --> 03:19.198
Thomas Jefferson was
all over that one.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.900
I'm actually kinda on your
dad's side about this one.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.236
Because this is like the
third car you've totaled.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.271
Like everyone hasn't
been through that.

03:26.273 --> 03:28.407
It's part of learning
how to drive!

03:28.409 --> 03:30.676
- I've never totaled...
- Whoa. Ahem!

03:30.678 --> 03:31.977
No. No, no,
no, no, no.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.912
You know, you can be
arrested for that?

03:33.914 --> 03:35.681
- Oh, can I?
- Uh-huh.

03:35.683 --> 03:38.417
Arrested, for committing
this public service?

03:38.419 --> 03:40.686
This is part of my campus
beautification initiative.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.554
You can read about it
in my five-step program,

03:42.556 --> 03:44.656
"how Farrell Bennett
will become president."

03:44.658 --> 03:48.493
Okay, yeah, you know, if you wanted
to clean this campus, Farrell,

03:48.495 --> 03:50.829
- you'd leave it.
- I would never leave this campus.

03:50.831 --> 03:54.499
Did you hear the news? Big Jim is having
a contest. You can win a new car!

03:54.501 --> 03:56.702
I could win a new car.

03:56.704 --> 03:59.471
That's what we were just talking about.
It's fate... thank you.

03:59.473 --> 04:02.241
I don't know who that guy is.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.476
Bye, friend.

04:04.478 --> 04:07.279
- We'll finish this later.
- Yes, we will.

04:07.281 --> 04:08.814
Let's go, Emerson.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.749
- Uh...
- Okay, em, come on.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.718
- Emerson.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.558
Arrested.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.894
Hey, there!
I'm big Jim!

04:22.896 --> 04:24.997
Like you don't already know.

04:24.999 --> 04:27.766
<i>And as always, I'm here
at big Jim's car depot,</i>

04:27.768 --> 04:29.868
- with my loyal dog, Bo!

04:29.870 --> 04:32.571
Hey, wave hi there, Bo!

04:32.573 --> 04:34.640
Now listen up. Here at
big Jim's car depot,

04:34.642 --> 04:36.608
we feel your pain.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.411
You're a teenager, and all
you want is a new car.

04:39.413 --> 04:43.315
Well, how would you
like to win <i> this</i> car?

04:43.317 --> 04:46.351
It's as simple as putting
your hand on this beauty,

04:46.353 --> 04:48.954
and then it's all about
who wants it the most.

04:48.956 --> 04:52.557
The teen who can stand with their
hand on this car the longest

04:52.559 --> 04:54.693
drives her home.

04:54.695 --> 04:57.896
<i>If you're between the ages
of 16 and 19, you can enter,</i>

04:57.898 --> 05:00.565
just text "dreamcar"

05:00.567 --> 05:02.701
to 06578.

05:02.703 --> 05:05.837
Don't you get caught sittin'
in the slow Lane for too long.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.874
You may get left in the dust!

05:08.876 --> 05:11.376
- Come on, Bo!

05:18.886 --> 05:22.754
Okay, so I downloaded an app that will
robotext in entries to the contest,

05:22.756 --> 05:24.723
I've calculated
that by 3:00,

05:24.725 --> 05:26.591
I'll have entered
1.2 million times.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.894
- Oh, you're gonna win.
- Oh yeah.

05:28.896 --> 05:32.064
Wait, dude, this is
the wrong number.

05:32.066 --> 05:34.700
No, it's not. Maybe it is.
I don't care.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.769
- It'll get there, okay? I promise.
- Okay.

05:37.771 --> 05:38.837
Wanna get lunch?

05:45.479 --> 05:48.980
<i>Therefore, fellow citizens
of these great classrooms,</i>

05:48.982 --> 05:51.783
I guarantee that if elect...

05:51.785 --> 05:53.685
Excuse me...

05:53.687 --> 05:57.089
When <i> elected class president,</i>

05:57.091 --> 06:00.759
I will endeavor to
eliminate nuclear weapons,

06:00.761 --> 06:03.595
not only from this campus,

06:03.597 --> 06:05.797
but from the entire world.

06:08.469 --> 06:11.470
I will make the
importation of ivory

06:11.472 --> 06:14.506
illegal in all classrooms
in the upper school.

06:16.844 --> 06:20.011
And I will negotiate

06:20.013 --> 06:22.414
a unilateral
cease-fire

06:22.416 --> 06:26.418
that will effectively end the
war with the junior class.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.758
And also, I want to reinstate the
soda machines in the cafeteria

06:32.760 --> 06:36.061
because we don't want no stinkin'
juice boxes anymore, yes!

06:36.063 --> 06:37.929
- <i>Oh, okay.</i>

06:37.931 --> 06:40.699
You guys have been great vote
Farrell, not Amy. Thank you.

06:40.701 --> 06:41.967
Ahem.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.503
Whoo!
Tell 'em, Amy!

06:44.505 --> 06:48.473
Not only does my opponent
promise the impossible,

06:48.475 --> 06:50.609
he promises
the incomprehensible.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.511
- Love you, girl!
- Elect me as your president,

06:52.513 --> 06:54.946
and I promise to have
my opponent expelled.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.982
<i>- Whoo!</i>
- Yes.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.518
- Yes. Whoo!
- They're announcing the contestants

06:59.520 --> 07:01.453
for big Jim's dream car contest

07:01.455 --> 07:04.022
- right now, online!

07:04.024 --> 07:06.124
- It's mine. It's my phone.
- Let me just see.

07:08.629 --> 07:12.464
- Hi, I'm Maya.
- And I'm Mia, and together...

07:12.466 --> 07:15.000
We're M&M.
- And we're here to introduce to you

07:15.002 --> 07:17.536
all the things you don't
want to miss out on.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.038
Today, we're giving you an
up close and personal look

07:20.040 --> 07:23.108
of the totally awesome teens who
have been chosen to be contestants

07:23.110 --> 07:25.644
in big Jim's dream car contest.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.646
Let's meet them now.

07:27.648 --> 07:31.082
<i>Here's contestant number one.</i>

07:31.084 --> 07:33.218
I am so stoked to be
the first dude chosen.

07:33.220 --> 07:36.988
I mean, some may question the physical
toughness it takes to compete

07:36.990 --> 07:38.890
in such a grueling sporting
endeavor, but I say

07:38.892 --> 07:41.092
your "physical" is my
"metaphysical," man.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.794
I'm all about the
adrenaline, all right?

07:42.796 --> 07:45.730
I have outrun avalanches
on my snowboard.

07:45.732 --> 07:48.133
I have gone ice climbing on
the glaciers of Antarctica.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.569
And I have fearlessly
surfed alongside

07:50.571 --> 07:52.471
great white sharks
in South Africa.

07:52.473 --> 07:53.672
Nothing is too extreme for me.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.041
If it's got wings or wheels,

07:56.043 --> 07:57.676
or it could end in sudden death,

07:57.678 --> 08:00.745
oh, it's got my name
written all over it.

08:00.747 --> 08:04.716
All right. Keep living
the dream, bros.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.619
<i>Here's contestant number two.</i>

08:07.621 --> 08:10.055
Oh, hi, everyone.
It's Sophie here.

08:10.057 --> 08:12.123
Welcome to my awesome
channel where I clue you in

08:12.125 --> 08:15.594
on all the latest tips and trends
in the world of beauty and fashion.

08:15.596 --> 08:18.930
Today, we'll be discussing
the importance of sunscreen.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.199
But, before I get into that,
though, I want to share

08:21.201 --> 08:23.902
with all of my thousands of
super close friends out there

08:23.904 --> 08:26.771
the incredible news that I have
been picked to participate

08:26.773 --> 08:29.174
in big Jim's dream car contest!

08:29.176 --> 08:31.676
Now I know,
there are a ton of you

08:31.678 --> 08:33.745
who are probably thinking,

08:33.746 --> 08:37.115
"OMG, she's already beautiful
and now she's lucky too?"

08:37.116 --> 08:39.183
And you may be feeling just
a little bit left out,

08:39.186 --> 08:42.754
but, not to worry,
I have got you covered.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.155
As always, I will be
documenting everything

08:44.157 --> 08:46.224
that happens during the contest,

08:46.226 --> 08:49.194
on YouTube, Twitter, vine, Instagram,
Snapchat, Pinterest, Wechat,

08:49.196 --> 08:50.996
Foursquare, Habbo,
Odnoklassniki, Renren,

08:50.998 --> 08:53.098
and of course, my own website.

08:53.100 --> 08:56.902
So you'll all be able to go on
this very special journey with me.

08:56.904 --> 08:59.671
And don't forget to like me.
It lets me know you care.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.240
So now, on to my
beauty tip of the day.

09:02.242 --> 09:05.577
Sunscreen. You should
totally wear it.

09:05.579 --> 09:08.213
<i>Here's contestant number three.</i>

09:08.215 --> 09:10.048
I'm a three-time
Indy champion.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.884
I took first place in Daytona
and Talladega in the same day!

09:12.886 --> 09:16.187
I completed the 24 hours
of Le mans in 22 hours!

09:16.189 --> 09:19.658
No one's more qualified to win
this competition than me.

09:21.295 --> 09:24.729
<i>Here's contestant number four.</i>

09:24.731 --> 09:27.198
Hi.
I'm Lala Zzyzx.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.969
You know, how in every teen movie
there's that awkward shy girl

09:30.971 --> 09:33.071
who just needs
a transforming makeover

09:33.073 --> 09:37.008
so that she can win the affections
of a good-looking, popular boy?

09:37.010 --> 09:38.944
Well, that's not me.

09:38.946 --> 09:41.880
My hair may not be as shiny
as yours or my teeth as white

09:41.882 --> 09:43.915
or my clothes as literally cool.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.851
You may not invite me to your
parties or even know that I exist.

09:46.853 --> 09:49.888
But guess what?
I don't care.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.890
Because I'm smarter than you.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.158
I'm captain of the science team.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.726
We're three-time
state champs.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.861
Oh, you don't think that's cool?

09:56.863 --> 09:58.830
It's not.
It's freezing,

09:58.832 --> 10:00.265
as in the formula for
freezing-point depression,

10:00.267 --> 10:02.767
but you probably don't know that

10:02.769 --> 10:05.904
because you've been too busy playing
that dumb app with the mad birds,

10:05.906 --> 10:09.774
an app that I invented, by
the way, when I was <i> nine!</i>

10:09.776 --> 10:12.277
So you may ignore me
and my friends now,

10:12.279 --> 10:14.079
but one day when we're
tech billionaires,

10:14.081 --> 10:15.880
you'll be fetching us coffee

10:15.882 --> 10:18.383
and picking up our hoodies
from the dry cleaners.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.218
Winning a car at big Jim's?

10:20.220 --> 10:22.387
I don't need to be
better-looking, or stronger,

10:22.389 --> 10:25.857
or tougher, or more
popular than you to win.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.926
I just need to be me.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.896
<i>Here's contestant number five.</i>

10:31.898 --> 10:34.933
Whoo! Colby Mann, defensive end,

10:34.935 --> 10:36.701
r-r-Roosevelt high!

10:36.703 --> 10:39.104
My game plan to win
this car is simple.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.740
I'll use my superior
athletic conditioning

10:41.742 --> 10:43.308
to send each and every
one of my opponents

10:43.310 --> 10:46.044
at home on a stretcher
in absolute tears.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.380
Until I remain
the last one standing

10:48.382 --> 10:51.683
and I take home
the championship.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.818
Whoo!
Go Spartans!

10:56.223 --> 10:59.691
Dude!
I wasn't ready!

10:59.693 --> 11:01.993
Can we do that again?

11:01.995 --> 11:04.329
<i>Here's contestant number six.</i>

11:04.331 --> 11:06.231
I think everyone
should give back.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.400
It's really our
duty as Americans.

11:08.402 --> 11:11.302
Personally, I get up
at 4:00 A.M. every day

11:11.304 --> 11:13.138
to work at the donut shop,

11:13.140 --> 11:16.107
then head to work at the
rock quarry after school.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.076
But... mmm.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.979
But I still find time every
week to volunteer here,

11:20.981 --> 11:23.915
helping out good citizens like Mr.
Adams.

11:23.917 --> 11:27.385
Here you go.
Because...

11:27.387 --> 11:29.954
<i>That's what my dad
taught me to do.</i>

11:29.956 --> 11:32.123
He's away fighting in Canada,

11:32.125 --> 11:35.860
defending our country,
but he said, "son,

11:35.862 --> 11:38.697
everyone can serve in some way,

11:38.699 --> 11:42.033
even if it's just by
serving our fellow man."

11:42.035 --> 11:45.403
<i>And contestant number seven.</i>

11:45.405 --> 11:47.305
Yeah, yo.

12:21.908 --> 12:25.043
Wow, Mia, those sure are
seven lucky teenagers.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.846
Wait a second.
Did you say "seven"?

12:29.883 --> 12:31.416
I did say "seven."

12:31.418 --> 12:34.185
But there should be
eight contestants.

12:34.187 --> 12:37.355
Well, silly, the eighth
one is a surprise.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.457
They don't even know
they've been picked yet.

12:39.459 --> 12:42.827
- From Northside high...

12:42.829 --> 12:44.162
Contestant number eight

12:44.164 --> 12:47.065
of big Jim's dream
car contest is...

12:47.067 --> 12:49.134
- Farrell Bennett!
- What?

12:49.136 --> 12:50.969
Yes! Oh, yes, I win.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.071
I win, everyone.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.006
<i>Thank you so much. I don't
care about this anymore.</i>

12:55.008 --> 12:57.008
I'm gonna win a car!
Yes!

12:57.010 --> 12:59.077
<i>Yes, we did it.</i>

13:14.261 --> 13:16.361
- Ooh!
- It's kinda scary.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.229
<i>It's horrifying.</i>

13:18.231 --> 13:21.933
Look at this, man. This is
where it all goes down.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.067
This is the end of the road.

13:23.069 --> 13:24.435
This is for all the marbles.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.838
This is where we separate
the men from the boys.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.573
This is for the whole
kit and kaboodle.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.977
- You make that up?
- No. That's legit.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.512
"Kit and kaboodle." People
say that all the time.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.881
- No.
- Yes.

13:36.883 --> 13:38.850
- You don't even know what a kaboodle is.
- It's a...

13:38.852 --> 13:42.220
It's a Korean poodle.
A "kaboodle."

13:42.222 --> 13:43.555
Seriously.
You didn't know that?

13:43.557 --> 13:46.591
Very aggressive breed of dog.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.560
Really?

13:53.900 --> 13:56.901
- My money's on him to win.
- Thank you, Zane.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.937
Uh-huh,
concussion brain.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.072
I'm gonna spell this out for you
because you probably can't read.

14:01.074 --> 14:04.609
- "F," as in "failure."

14:04.611 --> 14:07.045
You know, Dorka, I hear you've been
talking trash about winning this.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.547
Oh, I don't talk trash.
I talk truth.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.417
Words aren't gonna help you
win this competition, babe.

14:12.419 --> 14:15.954
This is all physical,
and I've been trainin'.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.156
Really? How do you
train for this?

14:19.426 --> 14:21.226
Well, I've been
standing around a lot.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.032
- 11 hours, 23 minutes.
- <i>What's that?</i>

14:28.034 --> 14:29.367
How long you been
hanging out with your

14:29.369 --> 14:31.369
"doctor who" action
figures last night?

14:31.371 --> 14:34.272
No. That's how long you'll
last in this competition,

14:34.274 --> 14:36.407
according to our
scientific calculations.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.447
Sorry.
It's just like,

14:42.449 --> 14:44.415
he's a football player,
and you're not.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.551
<i>Like, he's used to
physical punishment.</i>

14:46.553 --> 14:50.455
I think the last thing you
tackled was a bag of Cheetos.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.323
I carried this cooler.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.927
Oh, look at this guy.

14:55.929 --> 14:58.296
<i>Thinks he's all that.</i>

14:58.298 --> 15:00.298
He is all that. He's all
that with a side of fries.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.335
<i>Why's he need a car? He's
already got a motorcycle.</i>

15:04.337 --> 15:06.170
I know, right? He's probably
just getting the car

15:06.172 --> 15:08.673
so he can jump over it on
his stupid motorcycle.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.342
Loser.

15:11.344 --> 15:14.412
Dude.
I'm sorry.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.914
My money and everything else

15:15.916 --> 15:18.650
<i>is on her to win.
Sorry, man.</i>

15:18.652 --> 15:21.986
I forgive you.
It's understandable.

15:21.988 --> 15:24.422
You're the guy
from the cat videos!

15:24.424 --> 15:27.158
Hey, and you're the girl
in the girl videos.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.328
I love rapping cat. I retweet
everything he says, he's so funny.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.964
I don't know where he comes
up with some of that stuff.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.933
Actually, he comes up with
that stuff through me.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.534
Oh. Right.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.503
'Cause he can't type
with his little paws.

15:38.505 --> 15:39.938
And he can't rap either,

15:39.940 --> 15:43.174
because, you know, he's a cat?

15:43.176 --> 15:45.076
Right.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.312
Why isn't he here?

15:47.314 --> 15:51.316
Because he's at
home, being a cat.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.117
I see you've got your entourage.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.720
Oh, that's a crazy cat lady.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.156
She follows me everywhere.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.624
She wants to meet
the rapping cat,

15:59.626 --> 16:02.694
but I'm afraid she
wants to eat him.

16:02.696 --> 16:06.030
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
any fan is a good fan.

16:06.032 --> 16:09.067
Speaking of fans, where
are your supporters?

16:09.069 --> 16:11.035
I have all the friends
I need right here.

16:13.173 --> 16:17.141
- Well, good luck.
- You too. Oh... okay.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.210
Hi! Oh.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.446
All right, I gotta
go set up camp.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.414
- Gotta represent, buddy, okay?
- Gotta represent!

16:23.416 --> 16:25.616
All right, you gotta win one
for all the semi-intelligent,

16:25.618 --> 16:27.518
moderately handsome
guys out there.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.720
They need me as their leader.

16:28.722 --> 16:30.288
- Be the leader!
- Be the leader!

16:30.290 --> 16:32.090
- Be the leader!
- Meditate, meditate.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.227
- You got it.
- I'm ready.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.228
- You got it.
- Okay. Don't drop that.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.329
<i>All right.</i>

16:38.331 --> 16:40.298
- I miss you.
- <i>Miss you too.</i>

16:43.503 --> 16:45.003
Hey, you're Farrell, right?

16:45.005 --> 16:47.605
- Contestant number eight.
- Yeah.

16:47.607 --> 16:50.208
You must be Chris, right?
Number seven.

16:50.210 --> 16:53.044
Actually, I'm number one. Or
I will be when this is over.

16:54.414 --> 16:58.249
Just messing with you, man.

16:58.251 --> 17:01.386
Actually, you know, I'm kind
of pulling for all of us.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.454
We all deserve to win.
Just that...

17:03.456 --> 17:07.125
Maybe some of us deserve it a
little bit more than others?

17:08.560 --> 17:10.428
Are you messing with me again?

17:10.430 --> 17:11.429
<i>I can't really tell when
you're being serious.</i>

17:11.431 --> 17:13.631
Oh, look at her.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.434
Beautiful, isn't she?

17:16.435 --> 17:17.734
I don't know.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.137
Kind of like in a
Kardashian way, I guess?

17:20.140 --> 17:22.373
She's not really my type,
though, but like I see how...

17:22.375 --> 17:25.609
Oh, no.
Not her.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.377
Her.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.083
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

18:01.114 --> 18:03.481
You... are...

18:03.483 --> 18:05.349
A total...

18:05.351 --> 18:08.252
Loser!

18:08.254 --> 18:10.788
Seriously, tool,
get out of my car.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.092
Your car?

18:14.094 --> 18:16.194
Unless you came here
with a checkbook today,

18:16.196 --> 18:17.762
this ain't your car.

18:17.764 --> 18:21.165
No, no, I'm not gonna...
Not gonna buy a car.

18:21.167 --> 18:22.600
I'm gonna win one.
It turns out,

18:22.602 --> 18:25.203
"gameninjaking4.0"
didn't realize

18:25.205 --> 18:27.839
he actually had to leave his
house to be in the contest.

18:27.841 --> 18:30.141
So they had to draw
for a replacement...

18:30.143 --> 18:31.576
- No.
- And guess...

18:31.578 --> 18:33.744
- No!
- Who they picked.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.713
- No!

18:39.519 --> 18:41.519
Ah! How do I look with the car?
Good, right?

18:41.521 --> 18:43.621
What do you think, huh?

18:43.623 --> 18:46.424
What are you doing?

18:46.426 --> 18:49.393
I'm just testing out the waters.

18:49.395 --> 18:51.562
Look, I'm already athletic
and good-looking.

18:51.564 --> 18:54.332
<i>All I need now is a cool car
and I can get any girl I want.</i>

18:54.334 --> 18:55.633
<i>Really? That's why
you want the car?</i>

18:55.635 --> 18:57.869
So you can score chicks?

18:57.871 --> 19:00.238
That's the only reason any
guy wants a car like this,

19:00.240 --> 19:02.673
'cause a girl finds a guy more
attractive if he drives a nice car.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.208
<i>And that's a scientific fact.</i>

19:04.210 --> 19:05.910
Am I right?

19:05.912 --> 19:08.513
So "scientifically" speaking,

19:08.515 --> 19:11.482
what kind of car does a girl need
to drive to get a guy's attention?

19:13.219 --> 19:15.286
A guy could care less
what car a girl drives.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.888
We only care about the
way that you look.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.589
That's not a scientific fact.

19:18.591 --> 19:21.425
That's biology.
Am I right?

19:23.596 --> 19:26.364
That is so neanderthal of you.

19:26.366 --> 19:27.932
And why do you want the car?

19:27.934 --> 19:30.201
Because I want to prove
that a strong mind

19:30.203 --> 19:32.470
is more powerful
than a strong body.

19:32.472 --> 19:35.940
So this contest is just a
science experiment for you?

19:35.942 --> 19:37.909
It's as good a reason as any other.
Why do you want the car?

19:37.911 --> 19:39.544
I'm using this contest to boost

19:39.546 --> 19:41.946
my social media profile.
Same with Jerome.

19:41.948 --> 19:45.516
Yo, I just want to be able to do something
without a cat for once, you know?

19:45.518 --> 19:49.253
Okay, does anyone actually want
the car just to have the car?

19:49.255 --> 19:51.889
I do. I want it so I can jump
over it on my motorcycle.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.858
I knew it! I knew it, dude!
Do you remem...

19:53.860 --> 19:55.893
Oh, you weren't there when
I said that, I'm sorry.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.795
Okay, so you don't
even need the car?

19:57.797 --> 20:01.299
- That doesn't seem fair.
<i>- Fair?</i>

20:01.301 --> 20:03.401
Oh, we're talking about fair
stuff now, are we, Amy?

20:03.403 --> 20:05.236
Your dad's rich.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.772
You could buy any car you want.
Why are you here?

20:07.774 --> 20:10.808
Just because she's rich
doesn't mean she can't win.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.777
<i>We all have our reasons
for being here.</i>

20:12.779 --> 20:15.613
Yeah, what's yours? You want
to donate the car to charity

20:15.615 --> 20:16.948
so you can, like, save
a handicapped whale

20:16.950 --> 20:19.550
or an underprivileged
puma or something?

20:19.552 --> 20:21.586
Actually i...
I wanted the car

20:21.588 --> 20:24.455
so I could sell it and pay for
my mom's kidney transplant,

20:24.457 --> 20:26.591
before it's too late.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.760
I'm just kidding!

20:31.698 --> 20:33.864
- My mom is fine!
- That's a horrible joke.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.733
I just wanted the car to give it
to her so she didn't have to walk

20:35.735 --> 20:38.769
to her job as a janitor
at the prison every day.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.872
It's 15 miles each way,

20:41.874 --> 20:44.508
and it gets cold in the winter.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.477
- <i>Hi, I'm Maya.</i>
- And I'm Mia

20:46.479 --> 20:48.412
- and together...
- We're M&M.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.714
And we're here at big Jim's

20:49.716 --> 20:51.449
<i>for the start of
his dream car contest.</i>

20:51.451 --> 20:52.917
As you can see, all of
the lucky contestants

20:52.919 --> 20:54.885
are already here
surrounding the car.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.722
If I were them, I'd be sitting
down as much as I could right now.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.557
That's because you tend
to be a little bit lazy

20:59.559 --> 21:01.459
and let other people
do the work for you.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.427
Let's say hi!

21:03.429 --> 21:04.996
Here we have Jerome Bryant.

21:04.998 --> 21:07.398
You all know him as the
man behind rapping cat.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.800
Literally, he's the guy who
stands behind rapping cat.

21:09.802 --> 21:12.470
<i>And then we have none other
than Sophie Jackson,</i>

21:12.472 --> 21:14.372
<i>- Internet sensation.</i>
- Maya: <i> Aw!</i>

21:14.374 --> 21:17.742
She's almost as pretty in
person as she is online.

21:17.744 --> 21:21.612
- Then we have Klyde Kosar.
- And Colby Mann,

21:21.614 --> 21:24.048
our stud muffin athletes.

21:24.050 --> 21:26.450
I love athletes.
They're so athletic.

21:26.452 --> 21:27.852
- Call me <i>So do I, although</i>

21:27.854 --> 21:31.522
a few more sit-ups
wouldn't kill you, Colby.

21:31.524 --> 21:34.292
And then we have all the rest.

21:34.294 --> 21:37.628
Big honor to be here.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.563
<i>- Do you hear that?</i>
- Hear what?

21:39.565 --> 21:41.866
The sound of dreams
about to come true?

21:43.536 --> 21:45.469
It's big Jim!

21:45.471 --> 21:48.673
Hey there! Hello!

21:48.675 --> 21:50.975
How you doing? Hey there,
good to see you, pardner.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.537
Hey, how's it going?
Hey, hi, everybody!

21:54.514 --> 21:56.514
Welcome to my car depot!

21:56.516 --> 21:58.582
It's great havin' you here,
I was just telling Bo.

21:58.584 --> 22:01.786
It's like having a family over
for a barbecue, ain't it, Bo?

22:01.788 --> 22:04.689
We should be servin' hot dogs
or something, shouldn't we?

22:05.958 --> 22:07.525
No, no, no, we ain't...

22:07.527 --> 22:08.859
We ain't here
for hot dogs today.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.928
- We here for hot rods.
<i>- All right!</i>

22:10.930 --> 22:14.699
We are here for that
magnificent machine.

22:14.701 --> 22:18.102
Ain't she a beauty? And one
of you beautiful youngsters

22:18.104 --> 22:22.106
is gonna take that
car home very soon.

22:22.108 --> 22:24.408
Or maybe not so soon?
Who knows?

22:24.410 --> 22:25.976
We may be here a few hours,

22:25.978 --> 22:28.479
we may be here a few weeks.
I don't know.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.614
But before we get started,

22:30.616 --> 22:34.618
I do have to tell you a few
things that I am legally bound

22:34.620 --> 22:37.355
to communicate
in your direction.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.857
So, girls?

22:39.859 --> 22:41.692
Participation in this contest

22:41.694 --> 22:44.028
can result in,
but is not limited to,

22:44.030 --> 22:46.030
<i>swelling in the feet
and lower legs,</i>

22:46.032 --> 22:47.565
<i>numbness in the hands,</i>

22:47.567 --> 22:49.567
confusion, dizziness,
indigestion,

22:49.569 --> 22:50.935
severe constipation,

22:50.937 --> 22:53.037
<i>nausea and vomiting,
muscle aching,</i>

22:53.039 --> 22:55.373
<i>neck pain, sleeplessness,
sudden vision loss,</i>

22:55.375 --> 22:57.875
deep vein thrombosis
and in some cases,

22:57.877 --> 23:01.645
spontaneous combustion and sudden death.
Good luck!

23:01.647 --> 23:03.581
Well, whoa, whoa,
whoa, there, girls,

23:03.583 --> 23:05.983
nobody's gonna die, okay?

23:05.985 --> 23:09.720
Maybe from happiness, but not from
standing around for a few hours.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.555
Thank you, girls.

23:11.557 --> 23:14.392
Anyways, I can tell what
you all are thinkin'.

23:14.394 --> 23:16.060
You're thinkin', "I'm
just standin' here now.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.895
Why don't we get
this thing goin'?"

23:17.897 --> 23:20.798
Well, there are a few things
that you need to know

23:20.800 --> 23:22.466
before we start.

23:22.468 --> 23:25.503
First off, you will get one

23:25.505 --> 23:27.171
10-minute break
every two hours

23:27.173 --> 23:29.407
at the top of the hour.

23:29.409 --> 23:32.143
Now you can eat, drink
or pee, I don't care.

23:32.145 --> 23:35.479
Just as long as you're back in
time, 'cause if you're not,

23:35.481 --> 23:37.982
you're out!
Okay?

23:37.984 --> 23:39.550
And when you hear this sound...

23:42.155 --> 23:46.157
Ooh, that means that someone's
time here has come to an end.

23:46.159 --> 23:50.060
Next, do not
under any circumstances

23:50.062 --> 23:54.064
lift your hand off the car,
except for on a break.

23:54.066 --> 23:57.201
If you lift your hand
even the teeniest,

23:57.203 --> 24:00.671
<i>Li-ttlest</i> bit...

24:00.673 --> 24:02.440
You're out!

24:02.442 --> 24:04.141
And next, no sittin'.

24:04.143 --> 24:07.545
Just stand there with
your hand on the car.

24:07.547 --> 24:09.847
It's as simple as that.

24:09.849 --> 24:12.950
<i>Last man... or woman...
Standing</i>

24:12.952 --> 24:16.587
wins that magnificent machine.

24:16.589 --> 24:18.222
And one last thing.

24:18.224 --> 24:21.492
You are all on the honor system.

24:21.494 --> 24:25.129
If you see any of your fellow
contestants lift their hand,

24:25.131 --> 24:27.998
you are obligated to report it.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.002
But to avoid any kind
of moral conundrum,

24:32.004 --> 24:36.006
<i>two</i> of you have to see it
for it to be official.

24:36.008 --> 24:38.709
Helps keep things
on the up-and-up.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.845
<i>Are we clear?</i>

24:40.847 --> 24:42.580
- Everybody ready?

24:45.151 --> 24:46.817
Good luck.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.719
Girls, count 'em down.

24:48.721 --> 24:52.256
Ten, nine, eight,

24:52.258 --> 24:55.659
seven, six, five,

24:55.661 --> 24:58.729
four, three, two,

24:58.731 --> 25:00.164
one, go!

26:07.800 --> 26:09.967
Dude, whoa.
Are you okay?

26:09.969 --> 26:12.169
How can they expect us to do this, man?
We're just kids.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.877
<i>Oh, this is so brutal.</i>

26:19.879 --> 26:22.179
I don't know how much
longer I can last.

26:22.181 --> 26:24.615
Hang in there, man.
Just breathe.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.720
I can't see.

26:29.722 --> 26:32.156
I can't breathe!

26:32.158 --> 26:35.025
I can't feel...
I can't feel my legs!

26:49.842 --> 26:51.308
Okay, two people
saw that, right?

26:52.712 --> 26:56.013
It was 11 minutes, 23 seconds.

26:56.015 --> 26:57.915
Not 11 hours, 23 minutes.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.750
If this would've been
a Mathcathalon,

26:59.752 --> 27:02.720
that would've
cost us everything.

27:02.722 --> 27:04.722
Would you look at that?

27:04.724 --> 27:07.124
Kids these days, huh?

27:07.126 --> 27:11.128
With their world wide web
and their "on demand."

27:11.130 --> 27:14.698
Just ain't willin' to put
in the time, are they?

27:14.700 --> 27:17.267
Bo, why don't you go clean
up that big, gold mess, huh?

27:19.939 --> 27:23.707
11 minutes. That's sad.
That's sad.

27:23.709 --> 27:25.376
That's just sad right there.

27:25.378 --> 27:28.946
A tragic turn of events today
as Colby Mann collapsed

27:28.948 --> 27:31.382
and died mere moments
into the contest.

27:31.384 --> 27:34.752
- I'm not dead. He
will be dearly missed.

27:38.724 --> 27:43.193
One down, six to go, ha.

27:43.195 --> 27:46.230
Do you ever do anything in
life without posting it?

27:46.232 --> 27:48.399
The real question is,
if I don't post it,

27:48.401 --> 27:52.236
- did it ever really happen?

27:52.238 --> 27:54.304
Well, things certainly have

27:54.306 --> 27:56.774
picked up around here,
haven't they, huh?

27:56.776 --> 28:00.778
I got a feeling this contest
may just work out for us.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.379
You know what I'm gonna do?

28:02.381 --> 28:04.281
I'm gonna go sell me some cars.

28:04.283 --> 28:07.785
Bo, why don't you go
fetch some brochures?

28:07.787 --> 28:09.453
Aw, come on, big guy.

28:09.455 --> 28:12.322
I wasn't tryin' to
be disrespectful.

28:12.324 --> 28:13.791
You know what?
You look tired.

28:13.793 --> 28:15.259
Why don't you just
take a load off?

28:15.261 --> 28:17.194
Sit, boy!
Sit!

28:18.998 --> 28:21.098
Aw, come on, now!
It's just a joke.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.933
You don't have to actually sit.

28:22.935 --> 28:24.835
Stay.

28:24.837 --> 28:26.370
Stay... stay!

28:26.372 --> 28:29.306
Oh, come on now. I'm just
playin' with you, Bo.

28:29.308 --> 28:31.008
Huh? Let's
talk this out.

28:31.010 --> 28:33.110
Speak!
Speak, good boy!

28:35.848 --> 28:37.981
It's been one hour
and 58 minutes,

28:37.983 --> 28:40.818
and this contest has gone
from friendly to fierce,

28:40.820 --> 28:42.286
from chummy to cutthroat.

28:42.288 --> 28:44.755
From serene to...

28:44.757 --> 28:46.924
To... to...

28:46.926 --> 28:49.159
- What's an "s" word?
- "Stupid."

28:49.161 --> 28:51.261
You're looking for a word
that starts with an "s."

28:51.263 --> 28:53.363
It's not that hard,<i> sister.</i>

29:03.476 --> 29:05.776
Oh, two in a row.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.478
<i>I don't know what's
going on between you two,</i>

29:07.480 --> 29:10.147
but we're already in
a competition, okay?

29:10.149 --> 29:12.249
- We don't need another.
<i>- Seriously.</i>

29:12.251 --> 29:14.284
You guys aren't trending at all.

29:14.286 --> 29:16.854
I've posted like five things about
you and you have zero likes.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.322
It's kinda sad.

29:18.324 --> 29:20.991
Okay, first of all, there's
no competition here.

29:20.993 --> 29:22.860
At least not from my side.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.895
She's competing with me,
but she just always has.

29:24.897 --> 29:26.430
Oh, really?
Is that right?

29:26.432 --> 29:28.866
Yes, that is right. It all
started when we were six,

29:28.868 --> 29:31.802
and you just swooped in out
of nowhere and stole my crown

29:31.804 --> 29:33.804
- for the...
- The what?

29:36.142 --> 29:38.275
At the junior sunburst
beauty pageant.

29:38.277 --> 29:41.078
Yeah, because that
pageant was for girls.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.313
That was never specifically
defined in the rulebook!

29:43.315 --> 29:45.983
Okay, well, how about the time
that you joined the girl scouts,

29:45.985 --> 29:47.918
just to prove you could
sell more cookies than me.

29:47.920 --> 29:50.420
Yeah, and I did sell more cookies
than you, and you cried.

29:50.422 --> 29:52.322
I did not. He's lying.
I did not.

29:52.324 --> 29:54.458
Middle school. How you
convinced our basketball coach

29:54.460 --> 29:57.494
to make you center
instead of me.

29:57.496 --> 30:01.064
Well, it's not my fault you
hadn't hit puberty yet.

30:01.066 --> 30:03.367
Ninth grade, how you challenged
me in the spelling bee,

30:03.369 --> 30:05.469
and that whole
competition was fixed

30:05.471 --> 30:07.104
- - for you to win,
and you know that.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.106
"Fixed?" If by "fixed," you mean

30:09.108 --> 30:10.474
you actually had to
know your vowels,

30:10.476 --> 30:13.377
then yes, everybody,
it was fixed.

30:13.379 --> 30:15.245
<i>You know what?</i>

30:15.247 --> 30:16.880
<i>By the way, I do know
how to spell a word.</i>

30:16.882 --> 30:18.115
It's a hard one. Let's
see if I can do it.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.484
"Amy," b-r-a-t.
"Amy."

30:20.486 --> 30:22.553
Aw, that is the cutest thing.

30:22.555 --> 30:24.388
Have you been practicing with
your alphabet soup again?

30:24.390 --> 30:26.423
You know what, you are
just so salty right now,

30:26.425 --> 30:28.892
because someone failed
a class this year!

30:28.894 --> 30:30.894
- It was P.E.
- Yeah, who fails gym?

30:30.896 --> 30:33.397
I failed because I
refused to participate

30:33.399 --> 30:35.566
in a potentially life-threatening
sporting activity!

30:35.568 --> 30:39.036
- Ping-pong?
- Yeah! Okay, ping-pong!

30:39.038 --> 30:41.405
Thousands of people die each
year from playing ping-pong!

30:41.407 --> 30:45.008
Oh, you googled that, Amy,
because that is a lie!

30:55.855 --> 30:57.421
Oh, I just...
"googleable.

30:57.423 --> 30:59.289
Google that, why don't
you, Amy?" Ooh!

30:59.291 --> 31:02.392
Oh, I cannot stand that
obnoxious little jerk!

31:02.394 --> 31:04.528
He just knows how to push every
single one of my buttons.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.230
Every last one!

31:06.232 --> 31:08.165
It's like he's this
sniper that's just

31:08.167 --> 31:10.601
<i>picking off all of these
pieces of my soul.</i>

31:10.603 --> 31:13.303
Get out of my chair. I'm
mad and I need a friend.

31:16.208 --> 31:19.309
She is the most annoying,

31:19.311 --> 31:21.445
self-centered
person who has ever

31:21.447 --> 31:23.280
walked on the face
of this planet.

31:23.282 --> 31:25.282
I have had to deal with him
since the first grade.

31:25.284 --> 31:26.950
<i>Year after year,</i>

31:26.952 --> 31:30.053
for 11 years, Emerson, 11!

31:30.055 --> 31:32.322
- Scone?
- Please.

31:32.324 --> 31:35.158
You know what she's like?

31:35.160 --> 31:38.061
She's like this little worm

31:38.063 --> 31:41.398
that's burrowed its
way into my my mind,

31:41.400 --> 31:43.233
and she's just eating away at it

31:43.235 --> 31:46.303
with her mindless,
endless chatter.

31:46.305 --> 31:48.405
Yeah.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.441
Um, who are we talking about?

31:51.443 --> 31:53.911
- Amy!
- <i>Oh, Amy?</i>

31:53.913 --> 31:57.447
I like Amy.
She's not that bad.

31:57.449 --> 32:00.484
Not so bad? She's the
definition of bad!

32:00.486 --> 32:02.185
B-a-d. The "a" stands for "Amy."

32:02.187 --> 32:04.688
See that?
I know my vowels!

32:04.690 --> 32:07.457
I am beginning to think that
his only reason for existence

32:07.459 --> 32:10.060
<i>is to torture me, because
there doesn't seem to be</i>

32:10.062 --> 32:13.397
any other evolutionary reason
as to why he is on this planet.

32:13.399 --> 32:15.632
Well, at least he's not
too bad to look at.

32:15.634 --> 32:19.636
You know, he's got that kinda
tall, cute hair thing.

32:19.638 --> 32:21.672
I'm just saying, all right?
If you have to stand

32:21.674 --> 32:24.374
around someone for that long,
it helps that they're cute.

32:26.078 --> 32:28.979
Oh, my gosh.
Is the world ending?

32:28.981 --> 32:31.281
Because you calling him "cute" is like
the third sign of the apocalypse.

32:31.283 --> 32:34.685
- Jam?
- Thank you.

32:34.687 --> 32:37.721
Ooh, elderberry.
I love elderberry.

32:37.723 --> 32:40.023
- It's so good.
- So good, right?

32:40.025 --> 32:43.126
- Delicious, oh.
- What was I saying?

32:43.128 --> 32:44.728
Oh, yeah, I was
talking about how much

32:44.730 --> 32:47.297
I hate Farrell Bennett.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.399
What are we gonna do? I
cannot stand her anymore.

32:49.401 --> 32:52.636
Whiz me.
Uh-huh.

32:52.638 --> 32:54.972
We have to figure out a
way to take him out.

32:56.308 --> 32:59.142
- Clotted cream?
- Clotted cream?

32:59.144 --> 33:00.310
You think of everything.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.445
I try.

33:01.447 --> 33:03.480
Well, you know what they say.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.349
Anyhow, you know what they say.

33:05.351 --> 33:08.318
The way to get a woman
is through her heart.

33:08.320 --> 33:11.088
The way to get to a man
is through his stomach.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.256
- Well, they are right.
- Oh, my gosh, you're right.

33:13.258 --> 33:14.992
- They do say that.
- Yeah, they do.

33:14.994 --> 33:18.228
- I just got an idea.
- I have an idea.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.630
I need my phone. I need my phone!
I'm a genius.

33:20.632 --> 33:23.000
- But I'm gonna need your help.
- Okay, I'm in.

33:27.740 --> 33:29.473
See?
I knew it.

33:29.475 --> 33:31.408
Little miss type a, going
to the car already.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.143
I guarantee she just wants
to be the first one there

33:33.145 --> 33:35.145
to prove how perfect
she is to everyone.

33:35.147 --> 33:37.447
How much time is left
on the clock, chief?

33:37.449 --> 33:41.251
Um, looks like you got about...

33:41.253 --> 33:42.619
10 seconds.

33:52.131 --> 33:54.164
<i>Ten, nine...</i>

33:54.166 --> 33:56.033
- Thanks, dude.
- <i>Eight, seven,</i>

33:56.035 --> 33:59.169
six, five, four,

33:59.171 --> 34:02.506
three, two, one...

34:02.508 --> 34:04.174
No!

34:04.176 --> 34:06.610
- He made it.
- Ooh, how awkward.

34:17.623 --> 34:19.688
Hey, everyone!
It's Sophie here.

34:19.690 --> 34:22.559
It's been seven hours and there
are still seven of us left!

34:22.561 --> 34:25.529
Honestly, it hasn't been as hard
as I thought it was gonna be.

34:25.531 --> 34:28.165
<i>I mean, I waited four times as
long in line for the new iPhone.</i>

34:28.167 --> 34:30.132
Okay, well,

34:30.135 --> 34:31.400
I'll update you guys when the
next one bites the dust.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.803
Until then, hugs and kisses.

34:37.242 --> 34:39.242
I always get more attention
when I do the kiss at the end.

34:39.244 --> 34:40.577
- People like that.
- Is that really

34:40.579 --> 34:42.145
what you want to be
known for, though?

34:42.147 --> 34:43.612
Talkin' about
yourself on camera?

34:43.614 --> 34:45.482
It's not about
what you're known for,

34:45.484 --> 34:47.184
it's about being known at all.

34:47.186 --> 34:48.752
I mean, we all want
people to know we exist.

34:48.754 --> 34:51.554
I don't. I don't care if
anybody knows I exist.

34:51.556 --> 34:53.623
Of course you do.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.293
That's why you look
the way you do.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.528
That's why you enter all
those brainiac competitions.

34:58.530 --> 35:01.465
I mean, everything about you
screams "look how smart I am!"

35:01.467 --> 35:04.701
I mean, it's not like you're
hiding in a laboratory somewhere.

35:04.703 --> 35:07.471
I just want to share my
knowledge with people.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.306
Yeah, we all want
to share something.

35:09.308 --> 35:11.508
I mean, Jerome
has his cat thing,

35:11.510 --> 35:15.212
and Klyde jumps through, like,
flaming hoops or something.

35:15.214 --> 35:17.681
We all just want the world
to know that we're here.

35:17.683 --> 35:19.783
Think I'm with Lala on this one.

35:19.785 --> 35:21.818
I'm not like that at all. I
don't even have social media.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.587
Oh. Well,
you're just weird.

35:23.589 --> 35:26.189
All you care about is
that Amy knows you exist.

35:26.191 --> 35:28.158
- Amy?
- Mm-hmm.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.359
That's not even kind of true.

35:29.361 --> 35:31.461
Oh, okay, yeah. Okay.

35:31.463 --> 35:34.431
Why are you laughing?
It's the same with you.

35:34.433 --> 35:36.766
What?
No, come on.

35:36.768 --> 35:39.569
- It's actually kinda true.
- Yeah, sorry, but it's true.

35:39.571 --> 35:43.140
See? We all want someone
to know we exist.

36:04.630 --> 36:07.664
Mmm.

36:07.666 --> 36:11.168
You done good,
Emerson. Mmm.

36:11.170 --> 36:12.702
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.804
Hey.
What's up?

36:14.806 --> 36:17.307
Just makin' some brownies.

36:17.309 --> 36:19.576
Here. This one's
for you.

36:19.578 --> 36:22.846
For me?
Wow, thanks.

36:26.852 --> 36:30.220
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh.

36:30.222 --> 36:32.656
Hey, I mean, just because Amy
and Farrell can't get along,

36:32.658 --> 36:35.892
- doesn't mean we can't.
- I totally agree.

36:35.894 --> 36:39.229
You know, as a peace offering,

36:39.231 --> 36:41.598
I think I should make a
brownie for Farrell too.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.934
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:43.936 --> 36:47.504
- You're so nice.
- I know.

36:47.506 --> 36:48.872
Hey, could you get me some
more chocolate chips?

36:48.874 --> 36:50.874
I think they're down
there in my basket.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.576
Yeah!

36:54.479 --> 36:56.446
Could you do it now?

36:56.448 --> 36:57.814
- Oh, you want 'em now?
- Yeah, yeah.

36:57.816 --> 37:00.517
- Okay, cool, man.
- Yeah, cool.

37:05.591 --> 37:07.524
Eh.
There we go.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.228
- I got 'em.
- Oh, cool.

37:17.636 --> 37:18.969
Are you wearing my shirt?

37:18.971 --> 37:20.537
No, this is my shirt.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.439
Well, it looks a
lot like my shirt.

37:22.441 --> 37:24.741
- You mean the one you're wearing?
- What?

37:26.511 --> 37:29.279
Oh.

37:46.031 --> 37:48.665
Who is that?

37:48.667 --> 37:49.866
<i>That's Jack Guthrie,</i>

37:49.868 --> 37:51.401
the most popular,
best-looking,

37:51.403 --> 37:53.436
most attractive guy
at Northside high.

37:53.438 --> 37:54.938
How do you know who he is? You
don't even go to our school.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.539
It's Jack Guthrie!
You think you can keep

37:56.541 --> 37:58.508
a guy who looks like
that all to yourself?

37:58.510 --> 38:00.910
Psst. Psst!

38:06.418 --> 38:10.353
- Hey, Amy.
- Hi, Jack.

38:10.355 --> 38:13.523
Would you accept this rose?

38:13.525 --> 38:14.758
You know, I've been thinking.

38:14.760 --> 38:16.660
The prom is just
around the corner.

38:16.662 --> 38:19.663
- In five months.
- <i>In five months.</i>

38:19.665 --> 38:23.333
And I was wondering, well, if
you don't have any other plans,

38:23.335 --> 38:24.801
you'd maybe like to go with me.

38:26.405 --> 38:29.472
What...?
Wait, me?

38:29.474 --> 38:31.441
Oh, my gosh!

38:31.443 --> 38:33.476
Yeah, yeah, of course!
I'd love that.

38:36.615 --> 38:39.916
Great!
Well, let's go.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.685
Um, but it's in five months.

38:44.022 --> 38:46.589
Well, I'm sure you need
to pick out a dress

38:46.591 --> 38:48.358
and do your hair
and all that stuff,

38:48.360 --> 38:50.360
so we should probably just,
you know, get going.

38:50.362 --> 38:52.095
I'll go with you right now.

38:52.097 --> 38:53.930
- I'll go anywhere with you.
- I'm sorry.

38:53.932 --> 38:56.599
It can't be you. I'm
supposed to ask her.

38:56.601 --> 38:58.435
You're supposed...?

38:59.771 --> 39:03.606
Who told you to ask me?

39:03.608 --> 39:06.476
No one.
Just take my hand

39:06.478 --> 39:08.445
<i>and we'll be on our way.</i>

39:10.682 --> 39:14.884
Seriously? This is
the best you can do?

39:14.886 --> 39:17.887
<i>You thought by dangling some
shiny object in front of me</i>

39:17.889 --> 39:19.789
<i>I would be tempted
to leave the contest?</i>

39:22.594 --> 39:25.095
Question, do you have
any self-respect?

39:25.097 --> 39:27.764
- Not really.
- Okay, yeah. Thought so.

39:27.766 --> 39:31.468
Nice try, Farrell!
Better luck next time.

39:37.376 --> 39:38.775
What was that?

39:38.777 --> 39:41.478
I told you to ask her
on a date,<i> today!</i>

39:41.480 --> 39:43.913
Not to prom in five months!

39:43.915 --> 39:45.648
You think I'm giving you 200
bucks for that performance

39:45.650 --> 39:47.784
of a lifetime, you got
another think coming, pal.

39:47.786 --> 39:49.986
Well, you still owe me 50 bucks.

39:49.988 --> 39:51.921
- For what?
- My appearance fee.

39:51.923 --> 39:54.057
Oh, and $18.95
for the roses.

39:56.928 --> 39:59.729
Keep the change.
Buy a brain!

40:04.603 --> 40:06.636
Hey, miss congeniality!

40:06.638 --> 40:08.805
It's not a beauty competition.

40:10.976 --> 40:14.744
If it was a beauty competition,
there'd be no competition.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.447
You know, you could be
pretty if you wanted to.

40:17.449 --> 40:18.915
So you're saying I'm not pretty?

40:18.917 --> 40:20.583
Oh, no.
Let me rephrase.

40:20.585 --> 40:24.120
You could be <i> prettier</i>
if you wanted to.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.955
What if I don't want to, okay?

40:25.957 --> 40:29.826
What if I'm fine
just the way I am?

40:29.828 --> 40:31.828
I think you're afraid
of being pretty.

40:31.830 --> 40:33.596
I think you're afraid of
the attention you'd get.

40:33.598 --> 40:34.864
- That's not true.
- <i>Isn't it?</i>

40:34.866 --> 40:36.900
I mean, you hide
behind your brains,

40:36.902 --> 40:39.569
and you let your hair grow out
like an over-fertilized chia pet

40:39.571 --> 40:40.770
and you dress like a boy,

40:40.772 --> 40:42.605
<i>and not even a cute one.</i>

40:42.607 --> 40:44.507
I mean, if you just changed
a few little things,

40:44.509 --> 40:46.389
everyone could see how
beautiful you really are.

40:48.213 --> 40:52.081
I don't need to be beautiful, okay?
I'm smart.

40:52.083 --> 40:54.751
But why can't you be both?

40:54.753 --> 40:57.120
- Step into my office.
- So surprisingly strong.

40:59.524 --> 41:01.724
Dude, how's it goin'?

41:04.796 --> 41:07.163
Is this really all we have left?

41:07.165 --> 41:10.767
What kind of Sherpa are you?

41:10.769 --> 41:12.669
How about a brownie?

41:12.671 --> 41:15.038
A brownie?
Zane!

41:15.040 --> 41:18.041
I love brownies.
This is... oh.

41:18.043 --> 41:22.045
- This is so good!
- I know, it's so good.

41:24.850 --> 41:27.684
Oh!

41:27.686 --> 41:31.087
I want you to have these.

41:31.089 --> 41:35.091
Token of my appreciation. I
appreciate you, you know that?

41:35.093 --> 41:38.194
- You got these for me?
- For you.

41:38.196 --> 41:40.263
- Thank you, man.
- Mm-hmm.

41:40.265 --> 41:43.633
That makes me feel so special.

41:43.635 --> 41:45.502
You are.

41:45.504 --> 41:49.205
And so is this brownie.
Well done.

41:55.180 --> 41:57.213
Oh, I'm in such a good mood now.

41:57.215 --> 41:58.848
Thank you, I really needed this.

41:58.850 --> 42:00.183
- Okay.
- I really needed this. All right.

42:00.185 --> 42:01.618
- Go kill it, buddy.
- I'm gonna win.

42:01.620 --> 42:03.286
Go get us a car!

42:06.057 --> 42:08.057
You look amazing!

42:08.059 --> 42:11.995
- I feel amazing.
- Ooh.

42:11.997 --> 42:14.664
Yeah, this should fit you.
You have to try it on.

42:14.666 --> 42:16.032
How many clothes did you bring?

42:16.034 --> 42:17.534
Oh, I brought
my entire wardrobe.

42:17.536 --> 42:19.135
Okay, I'll give
you some privacy.

42:19.137 --> 42:21.871
It's time to show the
world the real Lala...

42:21.873 --> 42:24.007
Whatever your last name is!

42:24.009 --> 42:27.243
Zzyzx!
Nobody ever gets that.

42:30.815 --> 42:34.250
Oh, that's good.

42:34.252 --> 42:37.253
- Hey, where's Lala?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

42:37.255 --> 42:41.157
- Who's that?
- Is that her?

42:56.808 --> 42:58.608
Wait, what?

42:58.610 --> 43:00.276
It can't be. I know
that I'm not late.

43:00.278 --> 43:02.045
<i>I just checked
the time on my phone.</i>

43:02.047 --> 43:03.613
I mean, I
double-check...

43:05.183 --> 43:07.717
You!

43:07.719 --> 43:09.152
You changed the time on my phone

43:09.154 --> 43:10.587
so that I wouldn't
get back here in time!

43:10.589 --> 43:12.889
All I did was give
you a makeover.

43:12.891 --> 43:15.224
You look amazing, by the way.

43:15.226 --> 43:16.759
I look like <i> you!</i>

43:16.761 --> 43:19.829
Yeah. Like I said,
you look amazing.

43:19.831 --> 43:21.731
How could you?

43:21.733 --> 43:24.834
You know, I thought that for
a minute, we were friends.

43:24.836 --> 43:26.736
No, we could still be friends.

43:26.738 --> 43:29.372
I'll pick you up in my car when
I win, and we can go shopping.

43:29.374 --> 43:31.674
I'm sorry to interrupt,
little lady,

43:31.676 --> 43:34.811
but I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

43:34.813 --> 43:37.747
It's over for you.

43:37.749 --> 43:40.049
I won't forget this.

44:01.339 --> 44:05.008
You may have outsmarted me
but I am smarter than you!

44:05.010 --> 44:07.910
Oh, you just wait.
You'll regret this!

44:07.912 --> 44:12.115
You are gonna rue the day you
ever messed with Lala Zzyzx!

44:15.420 --> 44:18.955
Ooh-whee!
I'm gonna miss her, huh?

44:18.957 --> 44:22.191
- <i>She's a feisty one.</i>
- She looked good, though.

44:27.399 --> 44:29.732
You okay, man?

44:29.734 --> 44:33.036
Uh... Fine, yeah. No, I'm fine.

44:37.242 --> 44:40.410
- Hey, what's up?
- Hi.

44:46.151 --> 44:48.351
Hey, um...

44:48.353 --> 44:52.355
So, you know,
I've always kind of...

44:52.357 --> 44:54.924
Admired you from afar.

44:54.926 --> 44:58.361
I guess you could say I've
had a bit of a crush on you.

45:00.198 --> 45:03.099
But because of the whole
Farrell-Amy thing,

45:03.101 --> 45:08.705
I've never really gotten a
chance to know you, you know?

45:08.707 --> 45:12.108
Um, so I was wondering,

45:12.110 --> 45:14.811
will you accept these flowers?

45:18.283 --> 45:20.249
- Yeah.
- Okay.

45:20.251 --> 45:22.218
- Ah, that's okay.
- Okay.

45:23.788 --> 45:25.354
Thanks.

45:25.356 --> 45:27.423
My knees hurt,
so I'm gonna get up.

45:27.425 --> 45:29.992
Okay.

45:33.932 --> 45:36.399
Hi! It's Sophie here.

45:36.401 --> 45:39.102
Still.
I am still here.

45:39.104 --> 45:41.237
It's like this
is never gonna frickin' end.

45:41.239 --> 45:43.106
<i>You know what? Here's
my tip of the day.</i>

45:43.108 --> 45:45.074
Never do this.

45:46.811 --> 45:49.946
Six...
Oh, will you stop it?

45:49.948 --> 45:53.216
Can't you see we're all exhausted?
Stop being so energetic.

45:53.218 --> 45:55.418
You knew what you were signing up for.
This is an endurance contest.

45:55.420 --> 45:57.220
I came to win, all right?

45:57.222 --> 45:59.021
You know what? I think the
winner of this contest

45:59.023 --> 46:00.790
should be based on popularity,
not perseverance.

46:00.792 --> 46:03.059
Yeah, but if that was the
case, Jerome would win

46:03.061 --> 46:05.094
- because he has
more followers than y...

46:05.096 --> 46:06.863
- than you.
- He doesn't, his cat does.

46:06.865 --> 46:08.097
<i>The cat does, right.</i>

46:10.802 --> 46:13.436
You don't look so good.

46:13.438 --> 46:15.872
Well, I feel amazing, so...

46:15.874 --> 46:18.207
- I'm gonna be fine.

46:18.209 --> 46:21.377
You know, maybe this contest
should be based on need.

46:21.379 --> 46:24.180
If that were the case, Chris
probably deserves it most.

46:24.182 --> 46:27.216
- No, he doesn't.
- Guys, I'm willing to fight for this

46:27.218 --> 46:28.484
just like the rest of you.

46:28.486 --> 46:30.219
<i>I'm sure we all really need it.</i>

46:30.221 --> 46:32.989
Well, one of us
already had a car,

46:32.991 --> 46:34.891
<i>and wrecked it.</i>

46:34.893 --> 46:37.026
Personally, I think you've
already had a chance,

46:37.028 --> 46:39.862
you should step aside for
those more deserving.

46:39.864 --> 46:42.832
Oh, personally, I think that
you're a spoiled brat, so...

46:42.834 --> 46:46.302
Oh, god, if this were
based on who deserves it,

46:46.304 --> 46:48.471
<i>then you'd be
the first one to go.</i>

46:48.473 --> 46:51.808
Okay, I know you're not
feeling good, okay?

46:51.810 --> 46:55.411
- <i>The bathroom's right there.</i>
- I feel fine. I feel fine.

46:55.413 --> 46:57.246
I could really use a
break, though, hey.

46:57.248 --> 47:00.016
- Yes!
- Hey, twins! When's the break?

47:00.018 --> 47:01.551
- Oh, less than a minute.
- Yikes.

47:01.553 --> 47:04.086
<i>- Oh, my god.</i>
- Farrell, I don't think

47:04.088 --> 47:06.022
- you're gonna make it
to the break.

47:06.024 --> 47:09.826
I'm gonna make it.
I'm gonna make it.

47:09.828 --> 47:11.460
I'm gonna make it.
Oh, god!

47:11.462 --> 47:13.462
<i>Something's coming!</i>

47:13.464 --> 47:15.164
- Which end is it coming from?
- I don't know!

47:15.166 --> 47:16.899
What do we do?
What do we do?

47:16.901 --> 47:18.501
We're not gonna make it!

47:18.503 --> 47:20.236
- We're not gonna make it!
- We're gonna die!

47:20.238 --> 47:22.471
- Come on. Come on!

47:24.342 --> 47:27.910
Get out of my way!

47:31.115 --> 47:33.216
Aw, dude, come on. There's
like five minutes left.

47:33.218 --> 47:34.617
I really gotta use the
bathroom, come on.

47:34.619 --> 47:36.419
<i>Back off.</i>

47:36.421 --> 47:39.989
<i>A little privacy, please.</i>

47:39.991 --> 47:42.158
All right, I'm gonna see if there's
another bathroom in the garage.

47:42.160 --> 47:43.259
All right, hold my place, please?
Just in case?

47:43.261 --> 47:45.161
Absolutely.

47:46.397 --> 47:48.965
Ooh-hh...!

47:52.904 --> 47:54.237
Ah, god, okay.
Open.

47:58.409 --> 48:00.610
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

48:00.612 --> 48:02.945
- <i>That's the stuff.</i>

48:09.053 --> 48:12.421
Oh, come on.

48:15.560 --> 48:18.294
All right.

48:21.299 --> 48:23.499
Ah... hello?

48:23.501 --> 48:26.269
Door... door is...
Door is stuck.

48:35.580 --> 48:38.481
You put somethin' in his
brownie, didn't you?

48:38.483 --> 48:40.583
Maybe.

48:40.585 --> 48:44.420
- You're so clever!
- And you're so cute.

48:47.425 --> 48:50.059
Is anyone there?

48:50.061 --> 48:52.061
<i>Come on, come on, I gotta
get out of here! Hello?</i>

48:53.531 --> 48:56.532
- - Oh, help me.

49:00.104 --> 49:01.938
Whoa! Okay,
what is...

49:01.940 --> 49:04.006
What is going on here?

49:04.008 --> 49:08.978
Ahem! Emerson!
He is the enemy!

49:08.980 --> 49:11.514
Emerson!

49:11.516 --> 49:14.016
You know, to be honest, I just
feel embarrassed for you.

49:14.018 --> 49:15.618
You know, if you were to
see yourself right now,

49:15.620 --> 49:17.687
you'd realize just how
far you've fallen.

49:17.689 --> 49:20.189
Yeah, don't come crying to me
when you wake up one morning

49:20.191 --> 49:21.991
and you look at
yourself in the mirror,

49:21.993 --> 49:24.160
and you say to yourself,
"what has become of me?"

49:24.162 --> 49:26.295
Yeah, because I will be off,

49:26.297 --> 49:29.432
living another life that
doesn't involve... That.

49:31.302 --> 49:33.469
Can I at least have
something to eat?

49:35.573 --> 49:37.306
Wow, thanks.

49:48.519 --> 49:51.320
I bet you think you're
real funny, don't you?

49:51.322 --> 49:53.489
I... I don't know what
you're talking about.

49:53.491 --> 49:54.690
Don't you think
that I don't know

49:54.692 --> 49:57.460
that you were behind whatever...

49:57.462 --> 49:59.428
Problem I just had.

49:59.430 --> 50:01.731
Well, I am not saying that I
had anything to do with it,

50:01.733 --> 50:04.567
but if I did, you totally
deserved it, Farrell.

50:04.569 --> 50:07.370
- Hey, guys, could we have a truce?
<i>Six, five, four...</i>

50:07.372 --> 50:09.171
<i>Eh, just let 'em fight.</i>

50:09.173 --> 50:10.473
I mean, the more they
distract each other

50:10.475 --> 50:12.308
the better chance
we have of winning.

50:12.310 --> 50:15.044
<i>Go!</i>

50:16.748 --> 50:21.517
- Hey, where's Klyde?

50:24.022 --> 50:25.688
Not Klyde.

50:25.690 --> 50:27.056
God, you guys, it's getting like

50:27.058 --> 50:28.657
"the hunger games" around here.

50:28.659 --> 50:31.794
Yeah, except we can't
kill each other.

50:31.796 --> 50:34.030
Can we?

51:48.840 --> 51:51.240
Well, thank you there, Bo.

51:53.111 --> 51:55.544
Oh, look at them, hmm?

51:55.546 --> 51:57.279
Kids.

51:57.281 --> 51:59.615
<i>What with their eatin'
of the fast food,</i>

51:59.617 --> 52:02.751
and using Emojicons
instead of words,

52:02.753 --> 52:06.422
and wantin' everything
yesterday.

52:06.424 --> 52:08.224
They won't last much longer.

52:09.694 --> 52:11.494
My money's
on the funny-lookin' one.

52:14.532 --> 52:15.532
<i>Hey.</i>

52:17.301 --> 52:18.634
<i>Hey, Jerome!</i>

52:18.636 --> 52:20.769
<i>Hey, Jerome.</i>

52:20.771 --> 52:24.373
Jerome.
Hey, it's me.

52:24.375 --> 52:26.742
Everyone's laughing
at you, Jerome.

52:26.744 --> 52:28.644
<i>They all think you're a fraud.</i>

52:28.646 --> 52:31.347
<i>They all think
you're a talentless wannabe.</i>

52:31.349 --> 52:34.717
<i>Give up, Jerome.
Come home and scoop my poop.</i>

52:34.719 --> 52:36.719
It's all
you'll ever be good for.

52:38.923 --> 52:41.423
You're nothing without me.

52:41.425 --> 52:42.625
Hey, crazy cat lady,

52:42.627 --> 52:44.627
do you see that cat right there?

52:48.366 --> 52:49.899
I'm always seeing cats.

52:56.941 --> 52:58.908
You're nothing without me.

52:58.910 --> 53:00.809
<i>Oh, that's right.</i>

53:00.811 --> 53:02.645
Get outta here!

53:02.647 --> 53:04.580
<i>I'm the talented one.
I'm the one that sings.</i>

53:04.582 --> 53:06.815
You don't even have lips!
Ha!

53:15.326 --> 53:17.560
Did you see that cat
right there?

53:17.562 --> 53:19.828
What cat?

53:19.830 --> 53:22.364
It was a...
It was a big, giant,

53:22.366 --> 53:23.599
like, horror movie cat.

53:23.601 --> 53:27.269
It was just talking to me.
He was...

53:27.271 --> 53:29.572
Hey, how... how about
we go get you some coffee?

53:29.574 --> 53:32.241
Cat food?
I don't want no cat food.

53:32.243 --> 53:34.343
- I just...
- Coffee.

53:34.345 --> 53:35.844
I said "coffee," Jerome.

53:35.846 --> 53:37.947
- Coffee.
- Yeah. It's this way.

53:37.949 --> 53:40.382
Yeah, I need some coffee.

53:40.384 --> 53:42.818
- Yeah, coffee's this way.
- <i>He was right there.</i>

53:45.356 --> 53:46.488
Zane?

53:51.762 --> 53:52.762
Zane!

53:54.265 --> 53:55.598
Where are you?

54:08.379 --> 54:09.712
Hey, buddy.

54:11.682 --> 54:13.782
What were you doing in there?

54:13.784 --> 54:17.620
Nothing. Little bird watching.
Just chilling.

54:17.622 --> 54:19.922
<i>Bird watching in a tent?</i>

54:19.924 --> 54:21.357
Yeah.

54:21.359 --> 54:23.025
You alone in there?

54:26.330 --> 54:27.496
Yeah.

54:31.869 --> 54:33.969
You're fraternizing
with the enemy.

54:33.971 --> 54:35.704
<i>I don't... I don't know what
"fraternizing" means,</i>

54:35.706 --> 54:37.506
but if it means making out,

54:37.508 --> 54:39.608
yeah, I've been fraternizing
quite a bit, my brother.

54:39.610 --> 54:42.344
- Gimme a high five.
- No. No high five for you.

54:42.346 --> 54:43.512
This was not part of the plan.

54:43.514 --> 54:45.447
You have been compromised!

54:45.449 --> 54:49.018
Dude, i... I have feelings
for Emerson.

54:49.020 --> 54:51.854
Feelings?
What kind of feelings?

54:51.856 --> 54:54.657
Feelings of mistrust?
Feelings of disgust?

54:54.659 --> 54:55.658
Murderous feelings?

54:55.660 --> 54:56.659
What kind of <i> feelings</i>

54:56.661 --> 54:58.360
do you have for her, Zane?

54:58.362 --> 55:01.297
No, like, I think I want
to ask her father

55:01.299 --> 55:02.498
if I can court her.

55:04.735 --> 55:06.935
"Court her?"
Are we in the 19th century?

55:06.937 --> 55:09.038
<i>You been watching
"downtown Abbey" again?</i>

55:09.040 --> 55:11.006
No, you don't understand, man...

55:11.008 --> 55:13.409
You're right about that.
I don't, Zane.

55:13.411 --> 55:16.345
I am very disappointed in you.

55:16.347 --> 55:17.780
All these years of friendship

55:17.782 --> 55:19.848
and I don't even know
who you are anymore,

55:19.850 --> 55:22.551
but I see you've made
your choice, so fine!

55:22.553 --> 55:24.420
You know what?
I don't need you either!

55:25.990 --> 55:29.825
From now on, you are dead to me.

55:29.827 --> 55:32.361
Well, what about
the basketball game Saturday?

55:32.363 --> 55:33.696
Are we still on for that?

55:36.600 --> 55:38.534
Yes, we're absolutely still on
for the basketball game.

55:38.536 --> 55:39.802
- It's gonna be tight!
- So psyched.

55:39.804 --> 55:41.670
But until then...

55:44.675 --> 55:45.941
- You're dead to me.
- Yeah.

55:45.943 --> 55:47.076
- You understand.
- Yeah, I get it.

55:47.078 --> 55:48.844
This was a really good chat
for me.

55:48.846 --> 55:51.747
- Monumental, I think.
- Dude. Wish me luck.

55:58.989 --> 56:01.557
I'm running out of angles
for these selfies.

56:01.559 --> 56:05.094
Even I'm getting tired
of looking at myself.

56:05.096 --> 56:08.464
Hey Jerome, how does
the rapping cat do it?

56:08.466 --> 56:09.665
I'm not talking about the cat.

56:09.667 --> 56:11.033
I mean, he always looks so good

56:11.035 --> 56:12.501
in every single one
of his photos, right?

56:12.503 --> 56:13.502
<i>Does he have a stylist?</i>

56:13.504 --> 56:15.371
Not talking about the cat.

56:15.373 --> 56:17.373
He should come guest
in one of my segments!

56:17.375 --> 56:19.908
We can talk about, like,
beauty and hair.

56:19.910 --> 56:21.777
Does he deep condition?
Does he use mousse?

56:21.779 --> 56:23.779
Which he probably calls mouse!

56:23.781 --> 56:26.048
- Ah, I get it.
- Get it? He got it.

56:26.050 --> 56:27.716
Can you ask him for me?

56:27.718 --> 56:29.385
Okay! Enough about the cat
already, okay?

56:29.387 --> 56:31.019
Can we please stop talking
about the cat?

56:31.021 --> 56:33.622
- <i>Just lay off</i> the cat.
- Oh, my gosh.

56:33.624 --> 56:35.824
You sounded just like rapping
cat when you said that!

56:35.826 --> 56:36.959
You totally did!

56:36.961 --> 56:38.827
Has anyone ever told you that

56:38.829 --> 56:40.629
- you sound just like the cat?
- Okay, I don't sound like

56:40.631 --> 56:42.664
the cat, the cat sounds like me.

56:42.666 --> 56:45.167
Do you want to know why?
Because I am the cat.

56:45.169 --> 56:47.169
Cats don't rap.
They don't talk.

56:47.171 --> 56:49.037
In fact, I'm pretty sure
they don't do anything

56:49.039 --> 56:51.039
but eat, sleep,
and pee in every other place

56:51.041 --> 56:53.475
but the litter box
you so thoughtfully put

56:53.477 --> 56:55.477
in a convenient location.

56:55.479 --> 56:57.479
<i>It was a joke, people.</i>

56:57.481 --> 56:58.781
<i>I didn't know 33 million people</i>

56:58.783 --> 57:00.449
<i>were going to watch this.</i>

57:00.451 --> 57:02.117
And I didn't know folks
were so <i> ignorant</i>

57:02.119 --> 57:03.752
that they could think
that a cat...

57:03.754 --> 57:06.422
A freaking cat...
Could rap!

57:06.424 --> 57:07.890
It's just stupid.

57:07.892 --> 57:09.591
I'm more than just
some backup singer

57:09.593 --> 57:10.659
<i>to some untalented,</i>

57:10.661 --> 57:12.828
ungrateful, freeloading furball.

57:12.830 --> 57:14.997
I'm the talented one.

57:14.999 --> 57:16.198
Me!

57:18.102 --> 57:19.968
Okay, Jerome.
Show us!

57:19.970 --> 57:21.970
<i>- Come on, bring it!
- Show us!</i>

57:21.972 --> 57:23.005
- Come on, go Jerome!
- Come on!

57:23.007 --> 57:24.807
- Yeah?
- <i>Yeah!</i>

57:24.809 --> 57:27.810
Okay.

57:29.914 --> 57:31.513
Ah, here we go!

57:31.515 --> 57:32.981
<i>Oh!</i>

57:32.983 --> 57:34.950
Jerome in the house!

57:40.891 --> 57:41.891
Mm.

57:43.160 --> 57:45.828
Oh, man!

57:45.830 --> 57:47.763
Does that video
really have 33 million views?

57:55.139 --> 57:57.873
Just leave me alone.
Go home, already.

57:57.875 --> 58:00.742
But look what I'm making
for rapping cat.

58:00.744 --> 58:02.244
Great, now my cat has something

58:02.246 --> 58:03.912
to snuggle with at night.

58:03.914 --> 58:06.482
Thank you.

58:07.718 --> 58:09.751
And then there was four.

58:12.756 --> 58:14.089
How did you do that?

58:15.559 --> 58:16.892
Voodoo lady.

58:18.796 --> 58:20.262
Stay still!

58:22.633 --> 58:24.833
You smell like pizza.

58:24.835 --> 58:27.169
That's because
I haven't really, like,

58:27.171 --> 58:28.871
showered in a week.

58:28.873 --> 58:31.573
That's so cute!

58:31.575 --> 58:33.675
I have to be honest with
you and tell you that

58:33.677 --> 58:36.845
I am really attracted to you.

58:36.847 --> 58:40.649
You remind me so much of my mom.

58:40.651 --> 58:44.820
What? I remind you
of your mom?

58:44.822 --> 58:46.121
Yeah.

58:46.123 --> 58:48.790
- I mean, no. I just...
- What?

58:48.792 --> 58:50.659
- Oh.
- Yeah, so, like,

58:50.661 --> 58:53.562
<i>you're... you're smart
like my mom.</i>

58:53.564 --> 58:55.898
Right?
You're cool like my mom,

58:55.900 --> 58:58.600
and you're hot like my mom.

58:58.602 --> 59:01.270
What... "hot?"
Like your mom?

59:01.272 --> 59:03.205
What kind of a sick person
are you?

59:03.207 --> 59:06.275
No, I mean, like, you're
not hot like my mom,

59:06.277 --> 59:09.144
- she's hot like you.
- Yeah, that really... it doesn't help.

59:09.146 --> 59:10.679
That's not...
That's not helping.

59:10.681 --> 59:12.080
I don't think you
or my mom are hot.

59:12.082 --> 59:13.982
- Just... you know what? I lied.
- Okay...

59:13.984 --> 59:15.918
Okay, you don't smell
like pizza.

59:15.920 --> 59:17.152
You smell gross.

59:17.154 --> 59:18.854
Get out of my tent.

59:27.698 --> 59:30.198
Where's my makeup bag?

59:30.200 --> 59:31.700
Have you seen my makeup bag?

59:31.702 --> 59:33.569
No, I haven't.

59:33.571 --> 59:35.003
All I could find
was the stupid red lipstick.

59:35.005 --> 59:36.238
It doesn't even match
this outfit.

59:36.240 --> 59:38.140
I need my makeup bag.

59:38.142 --> 59:41.009
I'm sure you're just as pretty
without makeup.

59:41.011 --> 59:42.811
That's what they say
to ugly people!

59:42.813 --> 59:44.613
Don't patronize me!

59:44.615 --> 59:47.015
Get out!
Don't look at me!

59:48.752 --> 59:50.986
Oh, god, I need to find it.
I need to find it.

59:50.988 --> 59:54.590
Okay, come on.

59:54.592 --> 59:56.224
Get yourself together.
You can do this.

59:56.226 --> 59:57.826
You can do this.

59:57.828 --> 59:59.661
You have ziplined
over volcanoes.

59:59.663 --> 01:00:01.330
You can do this.
Just deep breaths.

01:00:01.332 --> 01:00:03.298
Deep breaths, all right.

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.167
Oh, where's the light?
Where's the switch?

01:00:05.169 --> 01:00:08.170
Come on.
There it is.

01:00:08.172 --> 01:00:10.372
Okay.
Uh...

01:00:10.374 --> 01:00:13.175
I don't know how long
I've been in here.

01:00:13.177 --> 01:00:15.844
It could be hours. It could be days.
I'm totally...

01:00:15.846 --> 01:00:17.980
- totally lost track
of time at this point...

01:00:17.982 --> 01:00:19.681
What was that?
Oh, no, no, no.

01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:27.723
No, no, no, no, no.
This is not happening.

01:00:27.725 --> 01:00:29.358
This is not happening.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:32.094
Okay, I want to die
in a tragic fireball accident,

01:00:32.096 --> 01:00:33.629
okay, not in a toilet.

01:00:33.631 --> 01:00:35.297
This is ridiculous.

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:38.367
Okay, come on, just breathe.

01:00:38.369 --> 01:00:39.901
Just breathe.

01:00:48.779 --> 01:00:51.380
Maya.
I'm doing it.

01:00:51.382 --> 01:00:53.382
I am balancing it on my head.

01:00:53.384 --> 01:00:55.117
Oh, my apple!

01:00:56.887 --> 01:00:59.221
- Hi, I'm Maya.
- And I'm Mia, and...

01:00:59.223 --> 01:01:01.823
We're still here.

01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:04.126
It's been 31 hours so far.

01:01:04.128 --> 01:01:06.728
<i>And five minutes. Thirty-one
hours and five minutes.</i>

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:07.863
<i>You can't forget the minutes</i>

01:01:07.865 --> 01:01:11.299
because every minute counts.

01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:14.836
You were definitely adopted.

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:18.106
- Hey, Soph.
- Oh, hi, Lala.

01:01:18.108 --> 01:01:19.908
Oh, what are you doing?

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:22.177
"At big Jim's
with <i> the</i> Sophie Jackson.

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:23.979
She's never
looked better."

01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:25.714
No, don't.
Don't post that.

01:01:27.818 --> 01:01:29.785
- Just did.
- No, you didn't.

01:01:29.787 --> 01:01:31.353
I can see how
this can be so addictive.

01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:32.988
It already has like 3,000 likes.

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:36.191
I'm gonna kill you!

01:01:37.928 --> 01:01:39.695
I just thought
you wanted to be noticed!

01:01:39.697 --> 01:01:42.030
I'm gonna shove
that phone up your...

01:01:44.435 --> 01:01:45.967
What?

01:01:45.969 --> 01:01:47.969
No. No!

01:01:47.971 --> 01:01:49.738
Stop taking pictures of me!

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.406
Stop looking at me!

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:52.808
Are you looking at me?

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:55.744
Stop looking at me!

01:02:00.484 --> 01:02:02.918
My taste for revenge
is like pie.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.187
It's never-ending.

01:02:05.189 --> 01:02:08.123
- Good luck everyone.
<i>- Thank you, Lala.</i>

01:02:12.196 --> 01:02:15.263
All right, so it's been 70 hours

01:02:15.265 --> 01:02:19.468
since I left on my bike
from horseshoe trailhead.

01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:21.937
Wait, that...
That wasn't even me.

01:02:21.939 --> 01:02:23.105
That was James Franco
in that movie

01:02:23.107 --> 01:02:25.407
where he cut his arm off.

01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:26.508
I'm not cutting
my arm off, right?

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:27.943
That's been done.

01:02:27.945 --> 01:02:29.778
Okay, I'm... I mean,
I could...

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:31.179
I could cut my leg off.

01:02:31.181 --> 01:02:33.949
That'd be different, right?

01:02:33.951 --> 01:02:35.851
Would it be different, though?

01:02:35.853 --> 01:02:37.285
Oh, my god, what am I saying?
I'm losing my mind.

01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:39.755
I am losing my mind right now.

01:02:39.757 --> 01:02:42.157
I'm hungry.
I need food.

01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:43.792
I need...

01:02:43.794 --> 01:02:46.762
Oh, I need water.
So, so thirsty.

01:02:48.465 --> 01:02:49.965
I mean, there's gotta be
water somewhere.

01:02:49.967 --> 01:02:51.133
Think, Klyde.
Come on.

01:02:51.135 --> 01:02:52.467
There's gotta be water.

01:02:52.469 --> 01:02:54.302
Sink doesn't work.

01:02:59.777 --> 01:03:00.976
God, okay, come on.

01:03:08.085 --> 01:03:09.417
Aw, god.

01:03:11.855 --> 01:03:13.522
Just do it.
Just do it.

01:03:14.558 --> 01:03:16.324
Damn it.

01:03:21.198 --> 01:03:23.298
Don't look at this.

01:03:27.337 --> 01:03:29.137
Sooner or later
you're gonna have to look out

01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:31.072
for yourself in this world.

01:03:31.074 --> 01:03:33.909
I mean, life is just so tough.

01:03:33.911 --> 01:03:37.112
You can't just let people
walk all over you.

01:03:37.114 --> 01:03:39.948
And sometimes, if you want
to get what you want,

01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:43.018
you have to stop trying
to be everybody's best friend.

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:47.155
Hey, listen, thank you
so much for listening.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:50.258
I mean, it just feels so good

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:54.095
to talk to somebody
that understands.

01:03:54.097 --> 01:03:56.498
Can I actually have
some of this? 'Cause...

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:57.966
Mmm.

01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:01.503
Okay. Thank you.

01:04:06.944 --> 01:04:09.511
- Hi, I'm Maya.
- And I'm Mia.

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:13.048
- And were still here!
- It's been like, a million hours,

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:15.016
- and yes, we're still here.
- Yep.

01:04:15.018 --> 01:04:16.451
This is ridiculous.

01:04:16.453 --> 01:04:18.386
How long are they going to be
standing there?

01:04:18.388 --> 01:04:21.323
- Well, I think.
- No one cares what you think.

01:04:21.325 --> 01:04:22.891
Well, I was just going to say...

01:04:22.893 --> 01:04:24.526
No one cares
what you have to say.

01:04:24.528 --> 01:04:26.995
In fact, without me,
you would have nothing to say.

01:04:26.997 --> 01:04:28.563
That's... wha...
What?

01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:30.332
You know what?
I'm finished.

01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:32.400
I'm... I'm outta here.

01:04:32.402 --> 01:04:34.536
I am done with this stupid
competition and I'm done with you.

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:37.472
Without me in your life, you
would have no idea what to do!

01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:43.578
Oh!
You scared me.

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:47.515
I'm sorry. I need to
talk to you in private.

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:48.583
About what?

01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:50.352
Farrell.

01:04:50.354 --> 01:04:53.955
It makes me so angry
to see how he treats you.

01:04:53.957 --> 01:04:55.590
In any other situation
I might have to

01:04:55.592 --> 01:04:58.994
just give him a punch
to defend you.

01:04:58.996 --> 01:05:01.029
- O-okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:05:01.031 --> 01:05:03.198
Yeah, but I think I can
handle him myself, so...

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.966
Well, I think that

01:05:04.968 --> 01:05:06.434
I have a way
we can get Farrell out

01:05:06.436 --> 01:05:09.471
of both of our lives.

01:05:09.473 --> 01:05:11.506
- What do you mean?
- <i>You know how</i> big Jim said

01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:13.909
that if two people
see someone lift their hand,

01:05:13.911 --> 01:05:16.244
they can have them removed
from the competition?

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:17.946
Yeah.

01:05:17.948 --> 01:05:21.082
Well, what if we see Farrell
lift his hand?

01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:25.153
Okay, well, obviously
if we see him lift his hand

01:05:25.155 --> 01:05:28.423
- we're gonna say something.
- No.

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:31.993
What if he <i> doesn't,</i>
and we say something?

01:05:34.998 --> 01:05:37.232
No. No, okay?
That wouldn't be right.

01:05:37.234 --> 01:05:39.234
I couldn't do that.

01:05:39.236 --> 01:05:41.536
Funny, because he didn't seem
to have a problem with it

01:05:41.538 --> 01:05:43.038
when he asked <i> me</i>

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.173
if I would help him
do that to you.

01:05:45.175 --> 01:05:48.009
- Wait, what?
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:49.611
Yeah, he thinks
we're gonna do it

01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:51.446
right after this,

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:55.216
that we're gonna get you
out of the competition.

01:05:55.218 --> 01:05:58.420
- I can't believe he would do that.
- I know, right?

01:05:58.422 --> 01:06:00.288
<i>What can you do?</i>

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:02.257
Oh, I know.

01:06:02.259 --> 01:06:05.060
We can do it to him instead.

01:06:05.062 --> 01:06:07.629
Take him completely unawares,
Amy.

01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:10.565
He'll never know what hit him.

01:06:10.567 --> 01:06:14.502
Anyway, think about it, okay?

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:16.438
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:22.279 --> 01:06:23.311
What?

01:06:24.614 --> 01:06:27.749
Hi, everyone.
It's Mia.

01:06:27.751 --> 01:06:30.385
And, eh... I'm...

01:06:33.623 --> 01:06:36.257
Antidisestablishmentarianism.

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:40.395
That was the word...

01:06:40.397 --> 01:06:45.166
That kept me from winning
the ninth grade spelling bee.

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:50.538
Not that I'm bitter
or anything. Hmm.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:54.609
Antidisestablishmentarianism.

01:06:54.611 --> 01:07:00.515
A-n-t-i-d-i-s-e-s-t-a-b-l-i-s-h-
m-e-n-t-a-r-i-a-n-i-s...

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:02.517
Nope.

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:06.087
A-n-t-i-d-i-s-
e-s-t-a-b-l-i-s-h-

01:07:06.089 --> 01:07:09.557
m-e-n-t-a-r-i-a-n-i-s-m.

01:07:12.129 --> 01:07:13.461
I just did it!

01:07:13.463 --> 01:07:14.729
- He just did it!
- I just did it!

01:07:14.731 --> 01:07:16.731
He just did it!
He just lifted his hand!

01:07:16.733 --> 01:07:18.700
- I... what?
<i>- Hey! Could...</i>

01:07:18.702 --> 01:07:21.569
Could we get big Jim over here, please?
He lifted his hand.

01:07:21.571 --> 01:07:23.071
No, I didn't.
What are you doing?

01:07:23.073 --> 01:07:25.306
Well, what's going on here,
kids?

01:07:25.308 --> 01:07:26.474
<i>Hey, big Jim.</i>

01:07:26.476 --> 01:07:29.277
He... he lifted
his hand, so...

01:07:29.279 --> 01:07:31.746
- <i>He's out.</i>
- Are you a psychopath?

01:07:31.748 --> 01:07:33.715
I did not lift my hand.

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:35.717
Now, the rules state
that two of you

01:07:35.719 --> 01:07:37.318
have to see it happen.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.754
So, Princess?

01:07:39.756 --> 01:07:41.523
<i>He take his hand off that car?</i>

01:07:42.759 --> 01:07:44.592
You saw it, Amy?
Right?

01:07:44.594 --> 01:07:47.328
She didn't see anything,
because nothing happened.

01:07:52.803 --> 01:07:54.402
Yes.

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:55.737
<i>I saw it.</i>

01:07:57.574 --> 01:08:00.141
But it didn't happen.

01:08:00.143 --> 01:08:01.676
He never lifted
his hand off the car.

01:08:01.678 --> 01:08:03.845
<i>What?</i>

01:08:03.847 --> 01:08:06.181
- She's lying!
- She's not lying. Amy wouldn't lie.

01:08:06.183 --> 01:08:07.749
<i>Oh, yeah, maybe
you're both lying.</i>

01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:11.119
Yeah, maybe you're in this
together, against me.

01:08:11.121 --> 01:08:14.089
Big Jim,
you should listen to me.

01:08:14.091 --> 01:08:17.492
Everybody knows
I'm the good guy here.

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:19.327
<i>- Good guy?</i>
- Farrell: <i> Ho, ho!</i>

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:22.863
Yeah. You're no
good guy, dude.

01:08:22.866 --> 01:08:24.631
Klyde, what happened to you?

01:08:24.634 --> 01:08:26.501
I just climbed out of a sewer,

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:28.203
that's what happened to me.

01:08:28.205 --> 01:08:31.139
I was stuck in the
toilet, and it was dark,

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.573
and it was scary, and...

01:08:32.576 --> 01:08:34.776
Unspeakable things
happened in there.

01:08:34.778 --> 01:08:36.243
Yeah.

01:08:36.246 --> 01:08:37.545
I escaped by crawling
through a pipe

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:38.712
under the toilet,

01:08:38.715 --> 01:08:41.582
the same toilet I've had to...

01:08:41.585 --> 01:08:43.685
- Drink out of
for the last three weeks

01:08:43.687 --> 01:08:46.520
to survive, so.

01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:48.823
We saw you yesterday.

01:08:48.825 --> 01:08:51.192
Klyde, can you just tell us
what's going on?

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:54.328
He locked me in the bathroom.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.233
- Me?
- <i>You, yeah.</i>

01:08:58.234 --> 01:09:00.234
That's ridiculous.

01:09:00.237 --> 01:09:01.469
You were the only one

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:02.770
that knew where
I was going, okay?

01:09:02.772 --> 01:09:04.305
- I know what you did!
- Oh, you know nothing.

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:07.207
Oh, I know plenty, Chris.

01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:08.910
I've had nothing
but time to think.

01:09:08.912 --> 01:09:10.345
I've contemplated everything

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:13.148
from "why does
the universe exist?"

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:17.318
To "what do
vegetarian zombies eat?"

01:09:19.589 --> 01:09:20.587
Whoa.

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:22.657
Look, the point is,

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.526
I thought about you,

01:09:24.528 --> 01:09:26.828
and all the bad things
you've done.

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:28.796
What?
Oh, god.

01:09:28.798 --> 01:09:30.798
- Don't get any closer.
- Or you'll what?

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.334
Change the time on my phone
like you did with Lala's?

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:34.868
Wait, you did that?

01:09:34.871 --> 01:09:36.537
He also stole
Sophie's makeup bag.

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:37.906
And took Jerome's headphones
to make it seem

01:09:37.908 --> 01:09:39.841
like the cat was talking to him.

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:41.843
Hold on, wait. You weren't
even here for that, though.

01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:46.346
You hear things when you are alone
in the bathroom, all right?

01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:47.582
It's quiet.

01:09:47.584 --> 01:09:50.752
Wait, so you poisoned
my brownie?

01:09:50.754 --> 01:09:53.321
No, no.
That was me.

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:55.757
Wait, but you had Jack Guthrie
come here

01:09:55.759 --> 01:09:57.859
- and try and lure me away?
- That was me.

01:09:57.861 --> 01:09:59.594
- Oh.
- But we're not talking about that right now.

01:09:59.596 --> 01:10:01.596
We're talking about <i> you!</i>

01:10:01.598 --> 01:10:04.365
- I always knew you were a fraud.
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:06.334
You said that you worked
at a donut shop

01:10:06.336 --> 01:10:07.969
every day before school.

01:10:07.971 --> 01:10:09.637
How is that possible?

01:10:09.639 --> 01:10:12.273
There is not an ounce
of fat on your body.

01:10:12.275 --> 01:10:14.542
Everyone knows
you can't be around donuts

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:15.877
without eating all of them.

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:17.645
Second, you told me you worked

01:10:17.647 --> 01:10:19.914
at a rock quarry
every day after school.

01:10:19.916 --> 01:10:22.483
Go ahead and feel
his hands, Klyde.

01:10:22.485 --> 01:10:25.820
<i>I think they feel like
a newborn baby's buttocks!</i>

01:10:25.822 --> 01:10:27.622
You haven't seen
a day of manual labor

01:10:27.624 --> 01:10:29.991
in your life.

01:10:29.993 --> 01:10:31.826
We're going in now.

01:10:31.828 --> 01:10:34.562
You said that your father
was fighting in Canada.

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:36.598
Well, I googled it.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.933
There's no war
in Canada right now.

01:10:38.935 --> 01:10:40.702
Not a single one.

01:10:40.704 --> 01:10:42.537
Your dad isn't serving
our country.

01:10:42.539 --> 01:10:45.773
He's serving drinks
at a nightclub in Toronto!

01:10:45.775 --> 01:10:48.343
<i>I am so on to you
right now, Chris.</i>

01:10:48.345 --> 01:10:50.478
Global warming.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.413
Was that you?
Huh?

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:54.382
Bieber fever, did you do that?

01:10:54.384 --> 01:10:55.817
What do you do
in your spare time,

01:10:55.819 --> 01:10:57.885
hunt manatees?

01:10:57.887 --> 01:11:01.723
And finally, you said
that you just <i> love</i>

01:11:01.725 --> 01:11:03.758
working with old people.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.394
But I know that the only
reason you have that job

01:11:06.396 --> 01:11:08.496
is so that you can nurse
your addiction

01:11:08.498 --> 01:11:09.864
to prune juice!

01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:13.635
- That's a lie!
- It's the truth!

01:11:13.637 --> 01:11:14.969
No...

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:18.373
It's true.

01:11:18.375 --> 01:11:20.475
That one was a total guess.

01:11:20.477 --> 01:11:22.510
I need that.
Klyde, give me that!

01:11:22.512 --> 01:11:26.314
- I need that!

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:32.920
You almost got me!
You almost got me.

01:11:32.922 --> 01:11:35.556
I'm just gonna put my hand back

01:11:35.558 --> 01:11:36.691
on the... you know.

01:11:36.693 --> 01:11:38.926
We're all...
We're all good.

01:11:38.928 --> 01:11:41.763
Well, son, unless you have some

01:11:41.765 --> 01:11:44.299
mystical third hand
that none of us here

01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:46.501
<i>know about...</i>

01:11:46.503 --> 01:11:48.703
You're out.

01:11:48.705 --> 01:11:51.539
Big Jim...

01:11:51.541 --> 01:11:53.941
They tricked me.

01:11:53.943 --> 01:11:56.311
And I think they should be
the ones that...

01:11:56.313 --> 01:11:58.313
That get out
of this competition,

01:11:58.315 --> 01:12:00.615
<i>not... not me.</i>

01:12:05.455 --> 01:12:08.523
You'll pay for this, Farrell!

01:12:08.525 --> 01:12:10.958
You will pay in retail!

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.960
And you!

01:12:12.962 --> 01:12:15.763
I thought we had
something special.

01:12:15.765 --> 01:12:16.964
<i>Oh, I'll be back!</i>

01:12:16.966 --> 01:12:18.566
Klyde!

01:12:18.568 --> 01:12:21.903
It's in my contract!

01:12:21.905 --> 01:12:23.638
I'm back for the sequel!

01:12:25.075 --> 01:12:27.608
<i>Well, then.</i>

01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:30.945
Unless my math fails me,
I believe we are down to two.

01:12:34.417 --> 01:12:35.583
Ew.

01:12:38.621 --> 01:12:40.722
Klyde, I am so sorry.

01:12:40.724 --> 01:12:42.657
It's not fair
you're out of the contest.

01:12:42.659 --> 01:12:44.992
You should at least have
another chance to win the car.

01:12:44.994 --> 01:12:47.028
Hey, no worries, you know?

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:48.429
It's not about the destination,

01:12:48.431 --> 01:12:50.665
it's about the journey,
you know?

01:12:50.667 --> 01:12:55.603
And I got to body surf on a
hundred yards of raw sewage.

01:12:55.605 --> 01:12:57.839
Anything after that
will be a letdown.

01:12:57.841 --> 01:13:01.008
So, goggles.

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:02.477
Thank you.

01:13:02.479 --> 01:13:04.545
Helmet.
Thank you.

01:13:05.949 --> 01:13:07.448
Motorcycle.

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.086
Dude, you...

01:13:12.088 --> 01:13:13.588
What'd you...

01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:15.957
Did you sell my motorcycle?

01:13:15.959 --> 01:13:17.725
Jim.

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:19.660
<i>Did you sell my motorcycle?</i>

01:13:21.631 --> 01:13:24.465
What do vegetarian zombies eat?

01:13:24.467 --> 01:13:25.633
- What?
- I don't know!

01:13:25.635 --> 01:13:27.168
- Me neither!
- I can't...

01:13:38.515 --> 01:13:40.782
I didn't know
you could make pies like that.

01:13:40.784 --> 01:13:42.750
Well, I'm a pretty good cook.

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:44.118
What do you want?

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.854
Look...

01:13:46.856 --> 01:13:49.624
- I know I might be a creep...
- Hmm.

01:13:49.626 --> 01:13:52.493
But I'm not the type of creep

01:13:52.495 --> 01:13:54.762
who would say weird things
about their mom.

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:57.932
Like, that's just not me.

01:13:57.934 --> 01:14:01.702
And I want to express to you
in no uncertain terms

01:14:01.704 --> 01:14:07.642
that I do not think my mom
is hot in any way.

01:14:07.644 --> 01:14:10.511
Like, at all.

01:14:10.513 --> 01:14:13.981
But I do think you're hot.

01:14:13.983 --> 01:14:16.918
I think you're so hot.

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:19.220
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:14:19.222 --> 01:14:22.690
I mean, you're foxy.

01:14:22.692 --> 01:14:27.061
I mean, you're hotter
than any mom could ever be.

01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:28.596
Yeah.

01:14:29.999 --> 01:14:31.866
- I mean, not like...
- Whoa.

01:14:31.868 --> 01:14:34.535
I mean, if you decided
to become a mom

01:14:34.537 --> 01:14:36.604
- that you wouldn't be hot.
- You know what, it's okay, it's okay.

01:14:36.606 --> 01:14:37.738
- You would be.
- <i>It's all right.</i>

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:38.906
Hey, can we just
not talk about moms?

01:14:38.908 --> 01:14:39.907
- Right.
- Yeah.

01:14:39.909 --> 01:14:42.510
- No moms.
- No moms.

01:14:42.512 --> 01:14:46.481
So, are we good?

01:14:46.483 --> 01:14:47.982
- Yeah, we're good.
- Okay.

01:14:49.752 --> 01:14:51.118
Is that your underwear?

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:54.722
Yes.

01:14:54.724 --> 01:14:58.059
But I promise
that they're clean... Ish.

01:15:03.867 --> 01:15:04.899
Hey.

01:15:06.035 --> 01:15:09.704
Thank you.

01:15:09.706 --> 01:15:11.806
For what?

01:15:11.808 --> 01:15:14.942
For defending me with Chris.

01:15:17.647 --> 01:15:21.015
Being a jerk to you is my thing.

01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:23.951
Come on, I can't have him
encroaching on my territory.

01:15:30.159 --> 01:15:31.626
Um...

01:15:32.729 --> 01:15:35.863
Can I tell you a secret?

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:38.232
- You would trust me with a secret?
- Oh, no.

01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:39.934
Heh, okay.

01:15:39.936 --> 01:15:42.703
You're just the only one
here, so I...

01:15:46.676 --> 01:15:47.676
Um...

01:15:49.279 --> 01:15:53.748
The real reason I need
this car is because, um...

01:15:55.818 --> 01:15:58.119
My family can't afford
to get me one.

01:15:59.689 --> 01:16:02.123
Aren't you, like, super rich?

01:16:02.125 --> 01:16:05.726
Actually, my dad got fired.

01:16:07.597 --> 01:16:09.797
My dad's looking for a new job,

01:16:09.799 --> 01:16:14.335
and my mom is looking
for my new dad.

01:16:18.341 --> 01:16:20.641
- Wow.
- Yeah.

01:16:22.712 --> 01:16:24.045
As far as secrets go,

01:16:24.047 --> 01:16:26.314
that's kind of
a lame one, though.

01:16:26.316 --> 01:16:30.151
I'm just saying, it's not...

01:16:30.153 --> 01:16:32.620
Everyone goes through
that kind of thing.

01:16:32.622 --> 01:16:35.156
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

01:16:39.896 --> 01:16:43.364
Can I tell you a secret?

01:16:43.366 --> 01:16:44.999
Yeah.

01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:51.238
Okay.

01:16:54.377 --> 01:16:56.310
Sophie was right.

01:16:58.748 --> 01:16:59.981
I always compete with you

01:16:59.983 --> 01:17:03.651
because I want you to notice me.

01:17:06.656 --> 01:17:09.123
I really like being around you.

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:17.732
That's definitely something
you shouldn't keep a secret.

01:18:12.822 --> 01:18:15.322
<i>Farrell.</i>

01:18:15.324 --> 01:18:16.791
<i>- Farrell.</i>
- - What?

01:18:16.793 --> 01:18:18.693
<i>Farrell, stay awake.</i>

01:18:20.063 --> 01:18:21.729
Ugh, I'm so tired.

01:18:21.731 --> 01:18:26.100
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

01:18:26.102 --> 01:18:29.870
I can't believe I used
to take sleep for granted.

01:18:29.872 --> 01:18:33.374
I mean, all those mornings
I woke up early

01:18:33.376 --> 01:18:37.745
just to vandalize your locker
before you got to school.

01:18:37.747 --> 01:18:40.147
I could've been at home in bed.

01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:43.017
I just can't believe
how much time I spent

01:18:43.019 --> 01:18:44.351
up late at night hacking

01:18:44.353 --> 01:18:46.320
into the school's
computer system...

01:18:48.391 --> 01:18:51.025
To change your grades
from as to cs

01:18:51.027 --> 01:18:53.427
or slash your service hours
or give you detention

01:18:53.429 --> 01:18:55.329
or take points off your sats.

01:18:57.767 --> 01:18:59.366
I'd trade it all in

01:18:59.368 --> 01:19:02.203
- for like, four minutes of sleep right now.
- Yeah.

01:19:02.205 --> 01:19:04.071
Wait, that was you?

01:19:08.911 --> 01:19:10.945
It's always been me.

01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:15.249
It's always been you.

01:19:56.993 --> 01:19:58.225
<i>Ahem!</i>

01:20:02.165 --> 01:20:03.998
Hi there.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.901
I am truly sorry to say this,

01:20:06.903 --> 01:20:09.370
but you are both out
of the competition.

01:20:09.372 --> 01:20:10.571
- What?
<i>- Wait, no, no.</i>

01:20:10.573 --> 01:20:12.273
Both of us?
That's not fair.

01:20:12.275 --> 01:20:16.377
After 50 hours
and eight minutes,

01:20:16.379 --> 01:20:18.979
- we have no winner.
- No.

01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:20.314
No, no, no.
That's not right.

01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:21.982
There has to be a winner.

01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:24.285
I'm sorry.
Rules are rules.

01:20:24.287 --> 01:20:27.321
<i>Now, I would like
to thank both of you</i>

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:29.223
<i>for your participation</i>

01:20:29.225 --> 01:20:31.258
by awarding you

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:36.330
these authentic
big Jim key rings, huh?

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:38.365
- I don't want that.
- <i>You sure?</i>

01:20:38.367 --> 01:20:40.301
- I'm positive.
- All right,

01:20:40.303 --> 01:20:42.136
<i>'cause I ain't
gonna offer it again.</i>

01:20:42.138 --> 01:20:46.106
Anyways, I want to wish
both of you a fantastic day.

01:20:46.108 --> 01:20:48.142
Thank you for playing.

01:20:48.144 --> 01:20:50.244
- Can he do that?
- I don't care if he can or not.

01:20:50.246 --> 01:20:51.979
- We're not gonna let him.
- This isn't fair!

01:20:51.981 --> 01:20:53.914
Dude, come on. We stood
there for three days.

01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:55.616
- Stop ignoring us.
- Is this just some big scam

01:20:55.618 --> 01:20:57.184
to get people
to come to your dealership?

01:20:57.186 --> 01:20:58.285
Were you even
gonna give us a car

01:20:58.287 --> 01:20:59.587
or are you just a crook?

01:21:03.593 --> 01:21:04.859
Me?

01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:09.129
I'm the crook?

01:21:09.131 --> 01:21:12.333
What about you?
You cheated!

01:21:12.335 --> 01:21:14.401
<i>You tried to lure her away</i>

01:21:14.403 --> 01:21:15.402
<i>with that
good-lookin' guy.</i>

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:18.272
And you, you poisoned him!

01:21:18.274 --> 01:21:20.474
<i>I got a news flash for you.</i>

01:21:20.476 --> 01:21:21.909
<i>Both of you were
looking for the easy way</i>

01:21:21.911 --> 01:21:23.277
<i>to get what you want.</i>

01:21:23.279 --> 01:21:26.180
That's what you all do now.

01:21:26.182 --> 01:21:28.549
I'll tell you something,
when I was your age,

01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:31.252
I had to work for my first car.

01:21:31.254 --> 01:21:33.420
Okay, I worked,
and I saved money for a year

01:21:33.422 --> 01:21:35.522
so that I could afford
the car of my dreams.

01:21:35.524 --> 01:21:38.092
Now, you guys
think life is just,

01:21:38.094 --> 01:21:41.295
I don't know, what,
some big popularity contest

01:21:41.297 --> 01:21:43.631
and whoever
has the most friends wins.

01:21:43.633 --> 01:21:45.633
You want something bad enough?

01:21:45.635 --> 01:21:48.168
Well, you've gotta work for it.

01:21:50.206 --> 01:21:52.539
You ain't gonna get it for free.

01:21:52.541 --> 01:21:54.008
And you sure ain't gonna take it

01:21:54.010 --> 01:21:55.576
from somebody else.

01:21:55.578 --> 01:21:56.644
We're not like that.

01:21:56.646 --> 01:21:59.346
The contest is over!

01:21:59.348 --> 01:22:00.581
Read the rules!

01:22:00.583 --> 01:22:02.316
It says very clear

01:22:02.318 --> 01:22:05.152
<i>in section three,
paragraph five, line six,</i>

01:22:05.154 --> 01:22:06.987
"the last person with their hand

01:22:06.989 --> 01:22:09.056
on that car wins!"

01:22:09.058 --> 01:22:13.193
There was no last person
and you both lose!

01:22:14.964 --> 01:22:17.197
<i>Now if you will
kindly excuse me,</i>

01:22:17.199 --> 01:22:19.533
I have a business to run.

01:22:21.938 --> 01:22:23.003
Wait!

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:26.307
Wait, no, I remember now.

01:22:26.309 --> 01:22:28.309
There was someone
with their hand on the car.

01:22:28.311 --> 01:22:29.977
It was Amy.
She won.

01:22:29.979 --> 01:22:31.712
No. No, no, no, no, no.
It was Farrell.

01:22:31.714 --> 01:22:33.180
I lifted my hand first, okay?

01:22:33.182 --> 01:22:35.015
<i>Farrell won, fair and square.</i>

01:22:35.017 --> 01:22:36.717
No, I definitely did not win,
that did not happen.

01:22:36.719 --> 01:22:39.086
Yes, you did, okay? Stop
trying to be so competitive.

01:22:39.088 --> 01:22:40.487
If I said you won, you won.

01:22:40.489 --> 01:22:42.222
I admit it, total loser,
right here.

01:22:42.224 --> 01:22:43.724
No, you won, Farrell.

01:22:47.730 --> 01:22:51.298
So shines a good deed
on a weary world.

01:22:54.603 --> 01:22:56.403
That was it.

01:22:56.405 --> 01:23:01.375
Right there, that is what
I was waiting for! Huh?

01:23:01.377 --> 01:23:03.110
So, were we competing for a car

01:23:03.112 --> 01:23:05.546
or for your chocolate factory?

01:23:05.548 --> 01:23:07.348
Don't you see?

01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:09.383
Guys, you were competing

01:23:09.385 --> 01:23:12.286
for all that's good
in the world.

01:23:12.288 --> 01:23:15.522
Hmm, you were competing
for virtues and values

01:23:15.524 --> 01:23:17.758
and honor and all that's right.

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.460
Well, yes, true,

01:23:19.462 --> 01:23:22.696
you were competing
for yourselves...

01:23:22.698 --> 01:23:27.034
But you were also competing
for each other.

01:23:27.036 --> 01:23:30.571
I was competing for the car.

01:23:30.573 --> 01:23:34.475
Yeah, listen, about the car...

01:23:34.477 --> 01:23:36.643
<i>Mommy made me eat my M&Ms.</i>

01:23:36.645 --> 01:23:38.112
Mommy made me eat my...

01:23:38.114 --> 01:23:41.215
- Hi, it's Maya here.
- And Mia.

01:23:41.217 --> 01:23:43.450
- And...
- We're back!

01:23:43.452 --> 01:23:45.452
And back together
because we're the only ones

01:23:45.454 --> 01:23:47.488
who can stand to be around us.

01:23:47.490 --> 01:23:49.056
Love you forever.

01:23:49.058 --> 01:23:51.558
Oh, I love you too.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.093
We all know you're wondering

01:23:53.095 --> 01:23:54.661
who won big Jim's
dream car contest,

01:23:54.663 --> 01:23:57.398
and we're here
with all the gory details.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.233
We'll get to the winner
in a sec,

01:23:59.235 --> 01:24:01.702
but first, let's take a
look at all the losers.

01:24:01.704 --> 01:24:03.404
<i>Colby Mann didn't live up
to his name</i>

01:24:03.406 --> 01:24:06.306
<i>and went all girly
less than 15 minutes in.</i>

01:24:06.308 --> 01:24:09.043
<i>Now, instead of wearing
an athletic supporter,</i>

01:24:09.045 --> 01:24:11.745
<i>- he is one.
- Aw, poor Colby.</i>

01:24:11.747 --> 01:24:14.681
<i>Lala Zzyzx didn't win,
and to be honest,</i>

01:24:14.683 --> 01:24:16.717
<i>I like the way she looked
before her makeover.</i>

01:24:16.719 --> 01:24:18.585
<i>Oh, my gosh, so glad
you said something,</i>

01:24:18.587 --> 01:24:20.454
'cause I totally agree.

01:24:20.456 --> 01:24:22.689
You should never
give into peer pressure.

01:24:22.691 --> 01:24:24.591
Don't change
to be like everyone else.

01:24:24.593 --> 01:24:27.394
Seriously, just keep it real.

01:24:27.396 --> 01:24:29.630
<i>Klyde Kosar didn't win,</i>

01:24:29.632 --> 01:24:32.099
<i>which is really sad
because he was really cute.</i>

01:24:32.101 --> 01:24:34.401
- Oh, yeah.
- Although he later attempted

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:36.336
to set a record
for jumping his motorcycle

01:24:36.338 --> 01:24:38.639
<i>over 53 food trucks.</i>

01:24:38.641 --> 01:24:40.507
<i>How impressive.</i>

01:24:40.509 --> 01:24:43.210
He's my man crush Monday
every single Monday.

01:24:43.212 --> 01:24:44.511
<i>Unfortunately,
it didn't work out</i>

01:24:44.513 --> 01:24:46.146
<i>quite how he planned.</i>

01:24:46.148 --> 01:24:48.382
<i>We wish you
a speedy recovery, Klyde.</i>

01:24:48.384 --> 01:24:50.684
We really do.
Call me, Klyde.

01:24:50.686 --> 01:24:52.186
Call me.
Call me.

01:24:52.188 --> 01:24:53.821
Call me.

01:24:53.823 --> 01:24:56.090
<i>Jerome Bryant lost the contest,</i>

01:24:56.092 --> 01:24:58.192
<i>but won a recording contract.</i>

01:24:58.194 --> 01:24:59.493
<i>More importantly though,</i>

01:24:59.495 --> 01:25:01.695
<i>how did he teach that cat
to rap?</i>

01:25:01.697 --> 01:25:04.398
- <i>Yeah, how?</i>
- That cat is so talented.

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:07.401
Seriously, I wish I had half
the talent that cat has.

01:25:07.403 --> 01:25:09.703
<i>Sophie Jackson...</i>

01:25:09.705 --> 01:25:12.372
<i>- Wait, what even</i> happened to her?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

01:25:12.374 --> 01:25:14.374
She hasn't tweeted
in three days.

01:25:14.376 --> 01:25:16.310
It's like she's fallen
off the face of the earth.

01:25:16.312 --> 01:25:19.113
Sophie, if you're okay,
please let us know by

01:25:19.115 --> 01:25:20.747
tweeting a selfie or something.

01:25:20.749 --> 01:25:24.118
Hashtag
"sophiewhereareyou?"

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.186
<i>Which of course leaves just two,</i>

01:25:26.188 --> 01:25:28.188
<i>our very own Katniss and Peeta.</i>

01:25:28.190 --> 01:25:29.256
<i>Katniss and Peeta?</i>

01:25:29.258 --> 01:25:31.825
- They're here?
- <i>N-no.</i>

01:25:31.827 --> 01:25:34.595
Amy Robertson
and Farrell Bennett.

01:25:34.597 --> 01:25:35.596
Oh.

01:25:35.598 --> 01:25:37.564
<i>So, which one won?</i>

01:25:37.566 --> 01:25:40.601
<i>Who was the ultimate winner
of their dream car?</i>

01:25:43.272 --> 01:25:45.672
It was a tie!

01:25:45.674 --> 01:25:47.608
Fifty hours.

01:25:47.610 --> 01:25:50.611
<i>I did not think
you would make it past four.</i>

01:25:50.613 --> 01:25:52.246
What can I say?

01:25:52.248 --> 01:25:53.881
I can wait years
for something I want.

01:25:53.883 --> 01:25:55.449
Yeah, you might want
to keep your hands

01:25:55.451 --> 01:25:57.317
on the steering wheel
there, don Juan.

01:25:57.319 --> 01:25:58.852
<i>Okay.</i>

01:25:58.854 --> 01:26:00.654
You, uh, you might need this.

01:26:02.691 --> 01:26:05.526
Yeah, okay!
This is so awesome.

01:26:05.528 --> 01:26:06.894
Let's go, let's go.

01:26:06.896 --> 01:26:09.163
Thank you.

01:26:13.202 --> 01:26:15.669
That, my friend,

01:26:15.671 --> 01:26:19.373
is the future driving off there.

01:26:19.375 --> 01:26:22.209
It don't look so bad.

01:26:22.211 --> 01:26:25.412
Come on, Bo.
I'm gonna take you for a walk.

01:26:25.414 --> 01:26:27.848
Ah, ah.
I'm sorry.

01:26:27.850 --> 01:26:29.750
That was wrong of me.

01:26:29.752 --> 01:26:31.618
I can't walk you
without a leash!

01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:33.520
That'd be against the law!

01:26:33.522 --> 01:26:34.522
Come on, Bo!

01:26:37.826 --> 01:26:39.793
You know, that was actually
a lot of fun.

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:46.266
- Were you just gonna kiss me?
- No.

01:26:46.268 --> 01:26:48.435
You were totally
just gonna kiss me just then.

01:26:48.437 --> 01:26:50.604
Do you have a problem with that?

01:26:50.606 --> 01:26:52.806
I have a huge problem with that.

01:26:52.808 --> 01:26:55.309
If anyone's gonna kiss anyone,
I'm gonna kiss you first.

01:26:55.311 --> 01:26:56.877
No, because the thing is,
is I thought of it first.

01:26:56.879 --> 01:26:58.645
You did not think of it first.

01:26:58.647 --> 01:27:00.280
I literally guarantee
you that I thought of...

01:27:00.282 --> 01:27:01.982
No, no, no, no,
that is not true.

01:27:01.984 --> 01:27:03.550
- Pretty true, I'd say.
<i>- Hey, guys.</i>

01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:05.385
Can you just kiss already?

01:27:05.387 --> 01:27:06.687
Yeah, that's just fine.

01:27:12.895 --> 01:27:16.396
- Cool.
- Okay.

01:27:16.398 --> 01:27:18.565
- Hey, when do I get to drive?
- Tomorrow.

01:27:18.567 --> 01:27:21.368
<i>We agreed, I get the car on
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,</i>

01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:23.804
<i>and you get it on Tuesdays,
Thursdays, and Saturdays.</i>

01:27:23.806 --> 01:27:25.472
<i>And we get it</i> on Sundays.
<i>- Maybe.</i>

01:27:25.474 --> 01:27:27.507
<i>See, we can all work together.</i>

01:27:27.509 --> 01:27:29.643
<i>Everything doesn't have to be
a competition all the time.</i>

01:27:29.645 --> 01:27:31.511
- Cool.
- Wait, guys, was that...

01:27:31.513 --> 01:27:33.247
Pay attention to the road.
- Okay,

01:27:33.249 --> 01:27:34.982
<i>I don't need you
telling me how to drive.</i>

01:27:34.984 --> 01:27:36.717
<i>Well, obviously you need
someone telling you.</i>

01:27:36.719 --> 01:27:38.385
<i>I thought we were past this.</i>

01:27:38.387 --> 01:27:39.853
<i>- I thought you changed.
- Changed from what?</i>

01:27:39.855 --> 01:27:42.389
<i>A licensed driver?
I know what I'm doing.</i>

01:27:42.391 --> 01:27:46.426
<i>- You just need to calm down.
- Okay, Amy, this is really...</i>
