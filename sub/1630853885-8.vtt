00:12.846 --> 00:16.099
Dr. Baltz, thank you
for meeting with us again.

00:16.767 --> 00:20.729
We want to drill down on that fifth day.
September 1st.

00:20.812 --> 00:21.855
We're all gonna die.

00:21.939 --> 00:24.024
It was anarchy.

00:24.107 --> 00:28.070
No one knew what was going on.
No one was in charge.

00:28.153 --> 00:32.073
And decisions were made
that should not have been made.

00:32.573 --> 00:35.244
We need to seriously lower our head count,

00:35.327 --> 00:38.956
and I think that you should evacuate
with the next group.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.040
Evacuate?

00:41.250 --> 00:43.961
Susan, I can't evacuate, I'm a doctor.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.504
Doctors look after patients.

00:45.587 --> 00:49.675
Horace,
there is nothing else any of us can do.

00:49.758 --> 00:52.386
I was told to get ready to leave,
right then.

00:53.470 --> 00:59.017
That I was
going to be sent out on a rescue boat.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.077
I have a tremendous sense of guilt
about it.

01:18.954 --> 01:21.623
About not staying there to the very end.

01:27.004 --> 01:33.969
True heroism would have been
to remember why we're doctors,

01:34.052 --> 01:37.598
and no matter how bad
the circumstances are,

01:37.681 --> 01:41.602
to adhere to our oath, "Do no harm."

01:45.898 --> 01:51.028
But in all that chaos,
people just cast off who they were.

01:51.612 --> 01:55.407
And this blindness just swept in
and took over everything.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.997
It took over everything.

02:05.918 --> 02:11.006
Wade in the water

02:12.549 --> 02:17.554
Wade in the water, children

02:18.639 --> 02:23.435
Wade in the water

02:23.519 --> 02:28.732
Wade in the water, children

02:28.815 --> 02:33.403
Wade in the water

02:33.487 --> 02:38.784
God is gonna trouble these waters

02:38.867 --> 02:42.871
Man went down to the river

02:43.830 --> 02:48.752
Man went down to the river, Lord

02:48.836 --> 02:53.006
Man went down to the river

02:53.841 --> 02:57.511
Went down there for to pray

02:59.137 --> 03:02.975
Wade in the water

03:04.226 --> 03:09.064
Wade in the water, children

03:09.147 --> 03:13.026
Wade in the water

03:13.735 --> 03:18.740
God is gonna trouble these waters

03:23.871 --> 03:29.877
God's gonna trouble these waters

03:47.477 --> 03:49.062
Afternoon, everybody.

03:49.855 --> 03:53.525
Memorial Hospital is a hospital
in the city of New Orleans.

03:53.609 --> 03:56.528
It's a big hospital,
been there a long time.

03:56.612 --> 04:00.324
Inside that hospital
is a smaller hospital called Lakeside.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.408
LifeCare.

04:02.367 --> 04:05.329
LifeCare.
LifeCare has acute care patients,

04:05.412 --> 04:08.874
some of whom, it is alleged,
were killed by lethal injection.

04:08.957 --> 04:12.878
Dr. Anna Pou and two nurses,
Cheri Landry and Lori Budo,

04:12.961 --> 04:17.089
have been arrested on four charges
of principal to second degree murder.

04:17.173 --> 04:22.596
Four patients were injected
with morphine and "mazdolome."

04:23.597 --> 04:24.640
Midazolam.

04:24.723 --> 04:27.726
Midazolam, otherwise known as Versed.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.479
Now, either drug can kill you,

04:30.562 --> 04:33.232
but when you put them together,
you get a lethal cocktail.

04:34.107 --> 04:37.152
Medical professionals perhaps thought
maybe they were God.

04:37.236 --> 04:42.699
They were entrusted with looking after
the safety of people who needed help.

04:42.783 --> 04:48.497
This is not euthanasia.
This is plain and simple homicide.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.332
The case now goes

04:50.415 --> 04:54.127
to the offices of Orleans Parish
district attorney, Eddie Jordan,

04:54.211 --> 04:57.589
who will choose whether to pursue
indictments for murder from a grand jury.

04:58.423 --> 04:59.424
Thank you.

05:00.551 --> 05:02.845
More fallout
from Hurricane Katrina on Tuesday--

05:02.928 --> 05:06.557
A doctor and two nurses
are charged with murder.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.351
â€¦facing charges
that they murdered four patients

05:09.434 --> 05:11.103
at Memorial Hospital in New Orleans.

05:11.186 --> 05:14.398
What kind of law enforcement
goes after doctors and nurses

05:14.481 --> 05:16.483
who stayed at their posts during a crisis?

05:17.067 --> 05:20.571
The attorney general's office arrested
three upstanding medical professionals

05:20.654 --> 05:23.991
so he could have himself a media event
to bolster his own reputation.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.993
Is your client, Dr. Pou, innocent?

05:26.076 --> 05:28.412
Yes. No doubt. Absolutely.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.706
There was no criminal misconduct.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.083
Here, you see this affidavit?

05:34.376 --> 05:36.420
This is just a piece of paper
with allegations on it,

05:36.503 --> 05:39.298
and like every piece of paper,
it's got two sides.

05:41.258 --> 05:44.887
There's no motive here,
and there is no homicide.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.599
What am I gonna do, Vince?

05:49.183 --> 05:51.643
How can I go outside?
What are people gonna think of me?

05:51.727 --> 05:53.145
What they're gonna think--

05:53.228 --> 05:56.982
They're gonna think you're being
falsely persecuted, which you are.

05:59.443 --> 06:00.485
Yeah, hello?

06:01.778 --> 06:03.155
Nope, she's not available.

06:03.906 --> 06:04.907
Excuse me?

06:06.116 --> 06:08.202
Yeah, it doesn't matter who I am. Okay?

06:09.203 --> 06:10.204
No, I cannot.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.208
You know what?
I'm just going to unplug the damn thing.

06:16.585 --> 06:19.671
There's still six or seven
of them lurking around out there.

06:19.755 --> 06:21.423
-You're kidding me.
-This is surreal.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.260
I have to surrender my passport.

06:25.344 --> 06:27.721
We have to show up
with $100,000 in bail by Thursday,

06:27.804 --> 06:29.473
or they're gonna put me back in jail.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.100
I cannot believe
this is actually happening.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.607
Mine's off. They found yours?

06:42.402 --> 06:45.405
-Hello.
-Vince, it's Dan Nuss. How are you doing?

06:45.489 --> 06:50.661
Hey, Dan.
We're doing the best we can, honestly.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.496
Listen, I'm trying to reach Anna.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.165
Yeah. All right. Just hang on a minute.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.126
Hi, Dan.

06:58.210 --> 07:00.587
Anna, I'm so sorry.

07:00.671 --> 07:05.259
What's going on, what they're
putting you through, it just sickens me.

07:05.342 --> 07:08.762
Everyone's on your side,
and people are asking what they can do.

07:08.846 --> 07:10.180
That's reassuring to hear.

07:10.264 --> 07:14.101
So, here's what I propose. I want
to set up a legal defense fund for you.

07:14.685 --> 07:16.103
Dan, that's not necessary.

07:16.186 --> 07:19.439
Yes, it is. Let's be pragmatic.
You're gonna need the money.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.650
And people all wanna help.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.694
That is incredibly thoughtful.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.445
Please.

07:25.988 --> 07:29.324
That a few disgruntled individuals
can make these ridiculous allegations.

07:29.408 --> 07:30.784
And then, suddenly this whole thing

07:30.868 --> 07:34.872
becomes a absurd
sensational national news story?

07:34.955 --> 07:36.874
As I said, it sickens me.

07:36.957 --> 07:41.211
I cannot tell you just how much
I appreciate this call and your support.

07:41.879 --> 07:45.048
Of course. We're all here for you.

07:45.966 --> 07:46.967
Battle's on.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.636
We do all this work,
and Foti can't even get the names right.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.931
Yeah. All that matters is what
the New Orleans district attorney does.

07:53.015 --> 07:54.349
What do you know about him?

07:54.433 --> 07:56.935
I'm not sure where
Eddie Jordan's heart and mind is on this.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.020
Great.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.692
We just need to make this case
as undeniable as possible to him.

08:03.775 --> 08:07.696
The first thing any DA's gonna wanna know
is how the experts classify these deaths.

08:08.572 --> 08:11.867
So that's where we're gonna focus,
on the forensic evidence.

08:14.912 --> 08:17.956
I promised a night on the town
for coming to consult.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.000
So I got us a table at Galatoire's.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.878
Then we'll see what kind of trouble
we get into after that.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.088
Bunch of pathologists on a bar crawl.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.382
Doesn't get much better than that.

08:28.175 --> 08:31.136
Butch,
the DA is coming to this meeting, or not?

08:31.220 --> 08:33.304
Eddie Jordan knows about the meeting.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.849
Let's just get started.
We can catch him up.

08:35.933 --> 08:37.768
Robert, do you want to lead off?

08:37.851 --> 08:42.523
Sure. So, my lab took a look
at tissue samples from 41 bodies.

08:42.606 --> 08:46.818
Twenty-three of them tested positive
for morphine or midazolam, or both.

08:46.902 --> 08:49.363
Okay, what's your analysis of the levels?

08:49.446 --> 08:51.949
These drug concentrations,
they seem very high to me.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.700
They're sticking out like a sore thumb.

08:53.784 --> 08:58.205
Given the condition of the bodies,
your results, do you think they're valid?

08:58.288 --> 09:00.624
Absolutely. Yes, I do.

09:01.542 --> 09:04.378
All right, then.
Let's go through the patients one by one.

09:05.087 --> 09:09.550
Alice Hutzler, 90-year-old LifeCare
patient being treated for pneumonia.

09:09.633 --> 09:13.220
Wednesday night, she had no
documented complaints of pain or distress

09:13.303 --> 09:14.805
that indicated a need for these drugs.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.349
Yet she was dead on Thursday afternoon.

09:17.432 --> 09:20.769
With morphine and midazolam
in her liver, brain and muscle tissue.

09:20.853 --> 09:24.106
-Neither of which was prescribed.
-Now, looking at these results,

09:24.189 --> 09:27.985
my analysis, Michael,
let me know if you concur, is homicide.

09:28.569 --> 09:29.820
I concur.

09:30.779 --> 09:31.905
Rose Savoie.

09:31.989 --> 09:34.992
Both drugs present,
no medical need indicated. Homicide.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.910
-Agreed.
-Wilda McManus.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.620
Homicide.

09:40.205 --> 09:41.790
Emmett Everett.

09:44.084 --> 09:48.297
This patient was apparently
aware, conscious and alert.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.466
With neither drug prescribed.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.011
-Homicide.
-I concur.

09:59.433 --> 10:00.434
Sorry I'm late.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.189
-Who are you?
-I'm assistant district attorney,

10:05.272 --> 10:06.315
Michael Morales. Who are you?

10:06.398 --> 10:10.152
I'm Butch Schafer. This is Virginia Rider.
We're from the attorney general's office.

10:10.652 --> 10:13.030
-Where's Eddie Jordan?
-I'm here on his behalf.

10:13.113 --> 10:16.283
The DA's got something better to do
than look into 20-plus possible murders?

10:16.366 --> 10:18.577
I'm the lead prosecutor on this case.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.287
If you have something to share,
let's hear it.

10:20.871 --> 10:23.248
Mr. Morales,
can we talk privately for a minute?

10:25.667 --> 10:27.503
Mr. Morales, I'm sure you would agree

10:27.586 --> 10:30.464
that the toxicology reports
in this case are critical.

10:30.547 --> 10:31.715
Obviously.

10:31.798 --> 10:35.260
We got the city coroner,
two outside forensic pathology experts

10:35.344 --> 10:37.179
and the director
of one of the nation's top labs,

10:37.262 --> 10:40.057
who all flew in here
to examine the evidence.

10:40.724 --> 10:42.351
It feels like Eddie Jordan should be here.

10:42.434 --> 10:45.687
The attorney general knew that we were
gonna be the ones prosecuting this case,

10:45.771 --> 10:47.439
but he's chosen to barely involve us.

10:47.523 --> 10:48.982
But this is our goddamn case,

10:49.066 --> 10:50.859
and we'll decide
how it's gonna be managed.

10:50.943 --> 10:53.320
So you don't think
this case merits the DA's full attention?

10:53.403 --> 10:55.405
Any death in this city
merits our full attention.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.908
But I would not call these
typical homicides.

10:57.991 --> 11:03.080
Look, I have been a prosecutor,
like you, for 27 years.

11:03.622 --> 11:07.501
And I can tell you that we have built you
a very good case. A very solid case.

11:07.584 --> 11:10.754
And I'll be the one to decide
whether or not that's true.

11:10.838 --> 11:11.797
You ready to go back in?

11:20.597 --> 11:24.977
I am sensing an enthusiasm gap
between us and ADA Morales.

11:25.477 --> 11:26.478
You think?

11:32.776 --> 11:35.237
Is anybody still talking
to those investigators?

11:35.904 --> 11:38.490
Not without a subpoena or a Tenet lawyer.

11:38.574 --> 11:41.076
Hope nobody else
says a goddamn word to them.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.287
If you don't mind me asking,

11:43.370 --> 11:47.499
why shouldn't the staff be willing
to talk to the investigators?

11:48.166 --> 11:51.086
If they didn't do anything wrong,
then what do they have to worry about?

11:51.628 --> 11:53.130
Are you really that naÃ¯ve, Horace?

11:53.213 --> 11:54.548
I was just wondering

11:54.631 --> 11:57.759
why nobody's willing to acknowledge
that mistakes were made.

11:58.427 --> 12:00.679
-Could I ask you a question, Horace?
-Sure.

12:01.346 --> 12:04.892
If you were given a choice
between comforting a patient,

12:04.975 --> 12:06.602
possibly quickening his death,

12:06.685 --> 12:10.606
or abandoning patients
to suffer a slow agonizing death,

12:11.481 --> 12:12.941
which would you choose to do?

12:13.025 --> 12:15.402
Why, I don't believe that was the choice.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.404
You can comfort people
without killing them.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.156
And no one had to abandon them.

12:19.239 --> 12:23.076
The fact is that when doctors
are given the untenable position

12:23.160 --> 12:25.829
of having to choose
who gets care and who does not get care,

12:25.913 --> 12:28.290
there are no right answers, Horace.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.459
There's just terrible choices.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.794
That's not what happened.

12:32.878 --> 12:37.674
It isn't? Where was the checklist?
The emergency protocols?

12:37.758 --> 12:42.095
Did anybody ever define this criteria
by which we were supposed to be operating?

12:43.347 --> 12:49.269
Ewing, all I want
is for us to sit down, all together,

12:49.353 --> 12:55.526
and figure out what went wrong
so we can learn from this for the future.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.697
I'm gonna get myself some crawfish.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.325
Yeah, me too.

13:05.536 --> 13:07.037
After Hurricane Katrina,

13:07.120 --> 13:10.082
the Superdome became
a symbol of loss nationwide.

13:10.165 --> 13:12.501
Now, it's synonymous
with hope and recovery.

13:13.085 --> 13:14.837
A massive renovation effort is underway,

13:14.920 --> 13:18.966
with workers laboring seven days a week
to fix what was once broken.

13:41.530 --> 13:44.241
We have been asked to cease investigating.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.536
What? Are you kidding me?

13:49.079 --> 13:54.251
Morales has drafted a letter
from Eddie Jordan to the attorney general

13:54.334 --> 13:55.961
saying that they don't need us anymore,

13:56.044 --> 13:58.422
that our continued work
would not be advantageous.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.174
"Not advantageous?"

14:00.257 --> 14:02.718
We have 50,000 pages
of documentary evidence.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.386
They requested a summary.

14:05.012 --> 14:08.015
A summary of 50,000 pages of work.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.059
Okay, how do we respond?

14:12.477 --> 14:14.438
I guess we write him a summaryâ€¦

14:17.065 --> 14:20.027
and then we drop
the 50,000 pages on his ass.

14:28.076 --> 14:29.077
Fuck.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.247
When we talked to Carrie Everett,

14:32.331 --> 14:34.917
the first thing she made clear
was that her husband, Emmett,

14:35.000 --> 14:38.128
was not about to die
when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans.

14:38.212 --> 14:40.047
Mrs. Everett, was your husband near death

14:40.130 --> 14:41.798
-when the hurricane hit?
-No.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.467
Do you think they didn't want to move him?

14:43.550 --> 14:46.345
Let's be real.
You're on the seventh floor.

14:46.428 --> 14:51.308
You got a man, paralyzed, 380 pounds.
You really want to risk injuring yourself

14:51.391 --> 14:53.936
to try to carry that man
down seven flights of stairs?

14:54.019 --> 14:57.022
Because of his size, that's why
you think he may have been killed?

14:57.105 --> 14:59.191
Yes, that's absolutely what I believe.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.984
-The hurricane causedâ€¦
-This ain't bad.

15:01.068 --> 15:03.570
The lawsuits against Tenet and Memorial
are getting publicity too.

15:04.279 --> 15:05.572
Who's filed so far?

15:05.656 --> 15:09.034
That I know, the families
of Emmett Everett, Alice Hutzler,

15:09.117 --> 15:12.746
-Rose Savoie and Hollis Alford.
-You believe this was murder?

15:12.829 --> 15:15.374
Yes. I think it was murder.

15:15.457 --> 15:16.750
Reporting from New Orleansâ€¦

15:16.834 --> 15:20.045
Family members are
giving interviews and filing lawsuits.

15:20.128 --> 15:24.049
It's creating a narrative for us
that's less than ideal.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.844
What they're saying, it's not true.

15:26.927 --> 15:30.097
Yeah, I know, but family members,
it's emotionally powerful.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.849
We got to find a way to counter it.

15:32.850 --> 15:33.851
Like what?

15:36.144 --> 15:37.563
I want you to go on 60 Minutes.

15:38.605 --> 15:39.731
They're interested.

15:40.232 --> 15:43.193
It's an opportunity for you
to tell your story in your own words.

15:45.195 --> 15:46.613
60 Minutes?

15:46.697 --> 15:48.574
I know you're strong enough to handle it.

15:48.657 --> 15:50.367
They could destroy me.

15:53.829 --> 15:57.207
Or it could be a way for the entire world
to see you the way I see you.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.129
Think about it.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.733
If I talk to them,
they could twist my words.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.319
You're innocent, Anna.

16:25.903 --> 16:28.280
They need to know who you are.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.283
They need to know you.

16:31.992 --> 16:37.497
That you're a deeply caring person
who didn't do anything wrong.

16:57.559 --> 16:59.353
All right, guys.

17:19.790 --> 17:23.085
This summer, Louisiana's
attorney general stunned the city

17:23.167 --> 17:25.963
when he charged
that four of Memorial's dead

17:26.046 --> 17:30.092
did not die from illnesses
or even from the horrific conditions.

17:30.175 --> 17:33.345
Tonight, for the first time,
we hear from the accused.

17:34.972 --> 17:39.393
It is unbelievably shocking for me
that I'm actually sitting here,

17:39.476 --> 17:43.647
having this conversation
with you on national TV.

17:44.982 --> 17:49.444
And I want everybody to know
that I am not a murderer.

17:50.028 --> 17:53.031
You went from being
a highly respected physician

17:53.115 --> 17:57.244
to, in the eyes of the law,
a criminal. What did that do to you?

17:58.203 --> 18:02.624
It completely ripped my heart out,

18:03.125 --> 18:08.338
because my entire life,
I've tried to do good.

18:08.922 --> 18:11.175
-And my entire adult lifeâ€¦
-She's very compelling.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.260
-I have given everything I haveâ€¦
-Yeah.

18:13.343 --> 18:16.180
â€¦within me to take care of my patients.

18:16.263 --> 18:17.389
Were people dying?

18:18.140 --> 18:19.600
Yes, people were dying.

18:19.683 --> 18:22.561
From their diseases
or from their conditions?

18:22.644 --> 18:27.441
You have to understand that there were
very sick people in the hospital.

18:27.524 --> 18:29.359
You had this intense heat,

18:29.443 --> 18:32.404
and we had a lack of all the tools
that we normally use.

18:32.487 --> 18:35.824
So people were dying
from the horrible conditions

18:35.908 --> 18:38.368
because they were not strong enough
to tolerate them.

18:38.452 --> 18:40.662
-Jesus.
-Bodies were piling up.

18:40.746 --> 18:42.789
The chapel became a morgue.

18:42.873 --> 18:47.002
Then gunshots were heard. There was fear
that looters might break in.

18:47.085 --> 18:50.631
Did you figure at any point
that you were really done for?

18:52.466 --> 18:57.387
Because you don't know me,
you don't know how tough I am.

18:59.181 --> 19:00.933
I don't think anyone gave up hope.

19:01.016 --> 19:04.019
I can tell you
I didn't give up hope because,

19:04.102 --> 19:08.941
as a cancer specialist,
I give hope to my patients.

19:10.025 --> 19:11.026
I am hope.

19:11.610 --> 19:16.198
She also says she is just
not capable of any sort of mercy killing.

19:16.281 --> 19:18.825
I do not believe in euthanasia.

19:18.909 --> 19:25.332
I don't think that it's anyone's
decision to make, when a patient dies.

19:25.874 --> 19:30.254
However,
what I do believe in is comfort care.

19:30.337 --> 19:35.384
And that means that we ensure
that they do not suffer pain.

19:35.467 --> 19:40.055
My role, as I said,
is to help them through their pain.

19:40.681 --> 19:42.766
As for Dr. Pou and the nurses,

19:42.850 --> 19:46.520
they are faced
with the prospect of life in prison

19:46.603 --> 19:50.566
and the possibility
of never practicing medicine again.

19:50.649 --> 19:52.025
That is the thing

19:53.735 --> 20:00.701
that is truly the most painful for me.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.913
I'm very committed, and I love what I do.

20:04.997 --> 20:09.251
I really love it.
It is the best thing about my life.

20:10.919 --> 20:12.379
And the fact that

20:13.630 --> 20:18.093
I may not be able to continue
to do the thing that I love the most,

20:18.177 --> 20:20.262
where I know I can do a lot of good,

20:21.013 --> 20:24.766
is just phenomenally,
phenomenally painful to me.

20:29.104 --> 20:31.982
So, guess what?
We got in all the final pathology reports.

20:32.566 --> 20:34.651
Wait. Can't I just
have a cup of coffee first?

20:34.735 --> 20:36.069
-Not a chance.
-Okay.

20:36.153 --> 20:37.821
Baden and Wecht confirmed in writing

20:37.905 --> 20:39.656
what they told in Minyard's office.

20:39.740 --> 20:43.035
In Baden's analysis: "Nine deaths
from LifeCare were due to drug poisoning."

20:43.118 --> 20:44.953
And Wecht, he analyzed 20 deaths

20:45.037 --> 20:47.623
and concluded that all of them
resulted from drug toxicity.

20:47.706 --> 20:49.625
Plus, we got additional reports
from Dr. Frank Brescia.

20:49.708 --> 20:50.959
"Homicide in nine cases."

20:51.043 --> 20:52.252
And then Dr. James Young,

20:52.336 --> 20:55.214
who is the president of
the American Academy of Forensic Sciences.

20:55.297 --> 20:57.966
"All these patients survived
the adverse events of the previous days,

20:58.050 --> 20:59.635
and for every patient
on a floor to have died

20:59.718 --> 21:02.721
in one three-and-a-half-hour period
with drug toxicity is beyond coincidence."

21:03.305 --> 21:04.306
It's irrefutable.

21:05.182 --> 21:08.894
It's not. Nothing's irrefutable.

21:08.977 --> 21:11.522
They're gonna challenge
the conditions of the bodies

21:11.605 --> 21:13.440
and Foti's claims
about the lethality of the drugs--

21:13.524 --> 21:16.818
But we got four top medical experts
all claiming these were homicides.

21:17.736 --> 21:18.904
Yeah.

21:20.322 --> 21:21.949
What is gonna be enough for you, Butch?

21:22.699 --> 21:23.700
This isn't about me.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.496
What?
Do I think these folks were murdered?

21:27.579 --> 21:29.164
Hell yes, of course I do.

21:29.665 --> 21:31.333
But what I'm trying to tell you is that

21:31.416 --> 21:33.085
evidence alone
isn't going to get it done here.

21:33.168 --> 21:34.670
Why? Because Pou went on 60 Minutes?

21:34.753 --> 21:36.672
Yeah, and she did incredibly well.

21:36.755 --> 21:39.258
-A TV show is not gonna decide this.
-You don't think it matters?

21:39.341 --> 21:40.801
-No.
-Okay.

21:40.884 --> 21:42.511
People in this city,
they're gonna want to know,

21:42.594 --> 21:46.390
"Why should Anna Pou,
a heroic doctor, go to jail?

21:47.224 --> 21:51.603
Why should she be the one person to take
the blame for everything that went wrong?"

21:53.272 --> 21:54.398
You know who didn't get arrested?

21:54.481 --> 21:56.024
Nobody from any corporate entity.

21:56.775 --> 21:59.319
Nobody from Tenet. Nobody from LifeCare.

22:00.487 --> 22:01.947
And what about the government officials?

22:02.030 --> 22:04.491
Why wasn't Governor Blanco arrested?
Or Mayor Nagin?

22:04.575 --> 22:07.369
They were the leaders.
They were the goddamn people in charge!

22:09.788 --> 22:11.832
That's what we have to overcome.

22:19.298 --> 22:21.925
Look, I'm sor-- I just--

22:22.009 --> 22:23.719
I'm just trying to be realistic here,

22:23.802 --> 22:25.804
so we can figure out how to get this done.

22:26.930 --> 22:28.182
Yeah, so what do you wanna do?

22:28.265 --> 22:31.518
Let's just send
all that forensic evidence over to Morales

22:31.602 --> 22:33.896
and maybe put a big red bow on it.

22:34.938 --> 22:36.106
Will do.

22:42.112 --> 22:47.367
Congratulations, Anna. You were fantastic.
That could not have gone better.

22:47.910 --> 22:49.578
-I hope you're right.
-I know I am.

22:49.661 --> 22:51.413
I've been in touch
with various medical groups.

22:51.955 --> 22:54.333
Statements of support are pouring in.

22:54.416 --> 22:55.417
All right, listen to this.

22:55.501 --> 22:57.836
I just got this
from the Louisiana State Medical Society.

22:57.920 --> 23:01.715
"The LSMS is confident
that Dr. Pou performed courageously

23:01.798 --> 23:04.009
under the most challenging
and horrific conditions,

23:04.092 --> 23:07.930
and made decisions
in the best interest of her patients."

23:08.013 --> 23:10.474
The medical community
is lining up behind you.

23:11.058 --> 23:12.267
It's very reassuring.

23:12.351 --> 23:14.853
I just got a call from Frank Minyard,
the parish coroner.

23:14.937 --> 23:17.940
He saw the interview.
He wants to sit with you.

23:18.565 --> 23:20.400
Why would I want to do that?

23:20.484 --> 23:22.819
This is a good thing. Trust me.

23:26.907 --> 23:29.076
It shocks me that we've never met before.

23:29.660 --> 23:32.955
I knew your father well. In fact,
I used to come by your house all the time.

23:33.872 --> 23:35.290
I was one of 11 kids.

23:35.374 --> 23:38.919
So, maybe I ran past you or
threw up on you, or something.

23:39.586 --> 23:40.754
That could've happened.

23:41.797 --> 23:43.382
Your father was a wonderful man.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.259
-And a great physician.
-Yes.

23:45.884 --> 23:48.679
And he was especially kind
in referring patients to me

23:48.762 --> 23:51.598
when I was starting my OB-GYN practice.

23:52.558 --> 23:55.269
He is the reason that I'm a doctor.

23:59.314 --> 24:00.774
So, how you holding up?

24:02.192 --> 24:05.445
To be honest, it hasn't been easy.

24:05.529 --> 24:07.614
I'm sure it has not.

24:11.201 --> 24:14.246
I do have some idea what you went through.

24:15.080 --> 24:17.749
During the storm,
to get to my office downtown,

24:17.833 --> 24:21.420
I had to wade, swim,
then hitch a ride on a boat.

24:21.503 --> 24:22.504
Oh, my word.

24:22.588 --> 24:24.173
I was stuck there for four days.

24:25.465 --> 24:29.845
-How precious did food and water seem?
-Yes.

24:29.928 --> 24:32.306
At night, I couldn't sleep
for all the sounds of gunshots.

24:32.389 --> 24:33.724
We heard them too.

24:33.807 --> 24:37.436
The people that weren't here,
they just can't understand.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.897
-No, they cannot.
-No.

24:41.106 --> 24:45.777
My job, as I see it, is not just
examining bodies. Anybody can do that.

24:46.737 --> 24:49.948
What I do is try to understand
why things happened.

24:52.492 --> 24:56.872
I like to get a handle on the people
involved, meet them face-to-face if I can.

25:01.376 --> 25:04.046
It's terrible right now,
the way our city's being judged.

25:04.129 --> 25:05.339
I couldn't agree more.

25:05.422 --> 25:08.634
I've dealt with
over 650 dead bodies from Katrina.

25:10.135 --> 25:13.263
650. And that's just here in New Orleans.

25:13.347 --> 25:14.598
It's unfathomable.

25:15.641 --> 25:18.060
I thank God I was not in that hospital,

25:19.311 --> 25:21.772
that I was not the one
who had to make those decisions.

25:24.024 --> 25:25.817
God bless you for all you did.

25:31.323 --> 25:34.243
Thank you. Thank you.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.351
That was Green Day, right here
on WVXT Baton Rouge,

25:59.434 --> 26:00.727
home of great rock music.

26:00.811 --> 26:02.855
And now, these local news headlines.

26:03.397 --> 26:06.441
New Orleans coroner, Frank Minyard,
released a statement this morning

26:06.525 --> 26:09.111
saying he's found no evidence of homicide

26:09.194 --> 26:11.738
in the case of 45 dead bodies
discovered last year

26:11.822 --> 26:14.700
at Memorial Medical Center,
in the wake of Hurricane--

26:14.783 --> 26:16.368
Hello?

26:16.451 --> 26:18.120
Did you hear what Minyard just announced?

26:18.203 --> 26:19.496
Yeah, I just heard it.

26:19.580 --> 26:20.956
How can he say there's no evidence?

26:21.039 --> 26:23.584
I told you, he's gonna want
to pass his own judgments.

26:23.667 --> 26:26.170
-That's bullshit!
-Hey, where are you?

26:26.753 --> 26:28.046
I'm going to New Orleans.

26:28.130 --> 26:30.174
No-- Virginia, no, no, no--

26:31.008 --> 26:32.050
Fuck!

26:36.096 --> 26:38.849
Excuse me! Hey! You can't go in there.

26:41.810 --> 26:44.062
How could you do this?
How could you say this?

26:44.146 --> 26:47.149
There is so much support
for Dr. Pou at this time.

26:47.232 --> 26:51.778
A public declaration of homicide would
do a lot more than just stir things up.

26:52.529 --> 26:54.573
It would be very bad for our city.

26:54.656 --> 26:57.701
How's it gonna be for the city when people
learn you swept the truth under the rug?

26:57.784 --> 26:59.620
Tell me something, Miss Rider.

26:59.703 --> 27:03.790
What happens the next time there's
a hurricane? Or the time after that?

27:04.917 --> 27:06.668
Because those times will come for certain.

27:06.752 --> 27:10.380
What happens when there's no
health care workers to fill our hospitals?

27:10.464 --> 27:12.674
No doctors. No nurses.

27:12.758 --> 27:15.719
Because they're too afraid that
if they do anything wrong in an emergency,

27:15.802 --> 27:17.304
they're gonna be treated like criminals.

27:17.387 --> 27:18.639
What happens to our city then?

27:18.722 --> 27:21.683
You're telling me that doctors are gonna
threaten the people of this city?

27:22.309 --> 27:23.602
That they're gonna walk off the job?

27:23.685 --> 27:25.187
Besides, that is not your job.

27:25.270 --> 27:26.647
I respectfully disagree.

27:26.730 --> 27:31.318
For 31 years, the entirety of my job's
been doing what's best for this city.

27:31.401 --> 27:34.238
No, your job, your actual job,

27:34.321 --> 27:37.866
is to make judgments based
on scientific fact, based on evidence.

27:38.534 --> 27:40.410
So just do your damn job.

27:41.870 --> 27:42.871
Do what you're supposed to do.

27:52.923 --> 27:55.926
From a distance,
it looks like any other American city,

27:56.009 --> 28:00.013
but to revisit New Orleans now
is to realize the scale of the betrayal.

28:02.850 --> 28:05.978
The president promised
the biggest rebuilding program in history,

28:06.061 --> 28:08.230
but come
to the very poorest neighborhoods,

28:08.313 --> 28:11.275
and there is no evidence
of government help whatsoever.

28:11.358 --> 28:14.862
The Ninth Ward, like the other poor,
mainly Black areas of this city,

28:14.945 --> 28:16.822
are being left to, quite literally, rot.

28:17.406 --> 28:19.199
And what is also so striking

28:19.283 --> 28:22.619
is there are very few people left here
to ask about the future.

28:23.161 --> 28:26.415
The Lower Ninth Ward
lost over 10,000 residents,

28:26.498 --> 28:29.877
leaving just 7%
of its previous population.

28:29.960 --> 28:33.422
It's very unfair. I think it's unfair.

28:33.505 --> 28:37.467
I don't know how long I can do this.
I might have to pack it up and move away.

28:54.234 --> 28:57.279
Look at you buying the first round. What--

28:57.362 --> 28:58.488
Thanks for meeting me.

28:59.364 --> 29:00.407
Hey, you all right?

29:03.076 --> 29:04.077
Butchâ€¦

29:06.246 --> 29:07.915
I can't do this anymore.

29:10.334 --> 29:12.544
I get how there's politics here.
I'm not an idiot.

29:12.628 --> 29:16.715
But I don't get how
people can stray so far from the facts.

29:16.798 --> 29:22.137
And I'm justâ€¦
I just can't stomach it anymore.

29:24.306 --> 29:27.935
Look, I overreacted.
We have a damn good case.

29:28.018 --> 29:31.271
No. You were exactly right.

29:31.355 --> 29:34.316
There's way more at play here
than just a set of facts,

29:34.399 --> 29:35.901
and I should open my eyes to it.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.404
I should've listened to you, butâ€¦

29:41.448 --> 29:43.825
now that I see where this train is going,
I've gotta get off of it

29:43.909 --> 29:45.536
-for my own sanity.
-No, Virginia.

29:45.619 --> 29:46.703
No, I'm not you.

29:49.081 --> 29:50.082
I justâ€¦

29:53.377 --> 29:56.046
I can't not
take this all incredibly personally.

29:57.297 --> 29:58.757
And it's tearing me apart.

30:04.429 --> 30:06.765
I've loved every minute
of working with you, Butch.

30:10.435 --> 30:11.645
But I'm done.

30:16.650 --> 30:20.445
-Can I argue this with you?
-Please don't.

30:20.529 --> 30:21.822
It's hard enough.

30:24.908 --> 30:26.410
We made a great team.

31:04.948 --> 31:07.784
Sir, they're almost ready for you.

31:18.253 --> 31:19.171
Thank you, dear.

31:23.550 --> 31:25.636
Thank y'all for coming out here today.

31:26.678 --> 31:29.014
I wanna clarify my prior statement.

31:29.806 --> 31:32.768
When I said I'd seen
no evidence of homicide

31:33.352 --> 31:36.063
thus far in the investigation
at Memorial Hospital,

31:36.146 --> 31:38.607
I did not mean that homicide was not

31:38.690 --> 31:41.276
the manner of death
of patients at Memorial.

31:42.027 --> 31:46.406
That is still to be determined and will be
the subject of further investigation

31:46.907 --> 31:50.953
and a presentation I will make
to the special grand jury.

31:51.036 --> 31:52.037
Thank you.

31:55.499 --> 31:58.961
How can he say one thing and then
say something completely different?

31:59.711 --> 32:00.712
I don't know.

32:00.796 --> 32:03.423
â€¦now saying he has not ruled out homicide.

32:03.507 --> 32:04.591
I'm gonna go do some work.

32:05.384 --> 32:08.846
Darling, maybe you should
take it easy for just a little bit.

32:08.929 --> 32:12.474
What am I gonna do? Sit around, worrying
about some outcome that I can't control?

32:12.558 --> 32:15.686
No, but what about this?
How about we take a trip, huh?

32:16.186 --> 32:18.480
Come on. Just the two of us.
We could just go down to Florida.

32:18.564 --> 32:21.900
And have someone take a picture of me
sitting on some beach vacationing?

32:23.360 --> 32:25.946
Vince, I know your heart
is in the right place, but that's not me.

32:26.029 --> 32:27.656
That's-- You know me.

32:27.739 --> 32:30.659
I have to keep busy.
That's how I keep myself sane.

32:39.585 --> 32:40.627
You may be seated.

32:45.299 --> 32:47.301
-Good morning.
-Morning. Morning.

32:47.384 --> 32:49.136
Ladies and gentlemen,
you have been selected

32:49.219 --> 32:52.723
as members of
the special grand jury for Orleans Parish.

32:53.765 --> 32:55.392
Now, you will hear evidence,

32:55.475 --> 32:57.436
and you will be guided
in your decision-making

32:57.519 --> 32:59.438
by the district attorney's office.

33:00.856 --> 33:02.649
This is not a trial.

33:03.317 --> 33:06.528
You will not be hearing
impassioned arguments from both sides.

33:07.029 --> 33:10.115
Instead, the district attorney's office
will lead you

33:10.199 --> 33:13.619
through information that they
have gathered on this particular case.

33:14.119 --> 33:19.416
They and I will provide instruction,
and you will indict when warranted.

33:20.542 --> 33:24.796
You will also keep secret all of
what goes on in here. Is that understood?

33:24.880 --> 33:26.548
Yes. Yes, Your Honor.

33:27.049 --> 33:29.635
Then your service has commenced.

33:32.638 --> 33:35.098
And we won't know anything
until they make a decision.

33:35.766 --> 33:41.730
What they do behind closed doors
goes on in total secrecy. All of it.

33:44.024 --> 33:49.446
If you asked me to devise
the most exquisite torture imaginable,

33:51.323 --> 33:52.616
this would be it.

33:54.117 --> 33:55.118
Yeah.

33:56.495 --> 34:01.124
A trial, no matter the verdict,
is gonna completely ruin me, Rick.

34:03.585 --> 34:05.087
What am I gonna do?

34:10.092 --> 34:11.342
All right, everyone.

34:12.386 --> 34:13.428
This is Maya.

34:13.512 --> 34:17.391
She's a 49-year-old woman
with recurrent pharyngeal carcinoma.

34:17.975 --> 34:20.686
We're gonna be working here for a while,

34:20.768 --> 34:24.231
so I want all of us to stay focused.

34:24.313 --> 34:25.482
Okay.

34:25.565 --> 34:29.402
We're gonna do all we can
for her with God's help.

34:29.485 --> 34:30.821
Amen.

34:42.583 --> 34:46.753
Dr. Pou, you were amazing today.

34:49.005 --> 34:51.175
We did some good work. All of us.

34:52.634 --> 34:56.929
Doc, I just wanted to let you know,
I contributed to your defense fund.

34:59.224 --> 35:02.811
Monica. Thank you.

35:03.395 --> 35:05.522
You're the kind of woman I wanna be.

35:07.107 --> 35:08.650
And I'm praying for you.

35:11.862 --> 35:15.949
Thank you. Yeah, I'm praying for me too.

35:37.304 --> 35:40.224
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, welcome back.

35:41.642 --> 35:44.686
Michael Morales, present
on behalf of the State of Louisiana.

35:44.770 --> 35:47.272
The grand jurors have a return
on this matter, Your Honor.

35:47.356 --> 35:49.316
In the case of Anna Pou,

35:49.399 --> 35:52.236
you've been asked to consider
a ten-count bill of indictment.

35:52.819 --> 35:54.488
One count of second-degree murder

35:54.571 --> 35:58.116
and nine counts of conspiracy
to commit second-degree murder.

35:58.784 --> 35:59.910
What say you?

36:21.014 --> 36:25.561
In each of these ten counts it is noted,
"Not a true bill of indictment."

36:25.644 --> 36:26.812
Is that correct?

36:27.396 --> 36:28.689
Yes, Your Honor.

36:29.189 --> 36:33.735
Very well then.
This matter and your service is concluded.

36:34.820 --> 36:37.239
An update now
on a controversial criminal case.

36:37.322 --> 36:39.116
The grand jury in New Orleans
will not indict

36:39.199 --> 36:42.411
a surgeon accused of killing
four seriously ill hospital patients.

36:42.494 --> 36:46.456
The grand jury have decided
not to bring criminal charges against her.

36:46.540 --> 36:47.541
Anna.

36:49.042 --> 36:50.043
They didn't indict you.

36:50.127 --> 36:51.712
-Not on any of the charges.
-Oh, my God.

36:51.795 --> 36:55.174
-Oh, my God. Oh, God. Lord, thank you.
-What? What? Nothing?

36:55.257 --> 36:57.092
Oh, Lord, thank you.

36:57.176 --> 36:58.177
Nothing?

36:59.052 --> 37:00.179
No.

37:08.395 --> 37:10.355
District Attorney Jordan.

37:10.439 --> 37:11.982
What do you think
of the grand jury's decision?

37:12.065 --> 37:15.027
I agree with the grand jury. Thank you.

37:15.110 --> 37:16.778
Mr. Morales, your comment, please?

37:16.862 --> 37:18.238
Please take a copy.

37:18.322 --> 37:21.867
You'll see that forensic experts
from all over the country

37:21.950 --> 37:25.954
have concluded that the deaths in question
that occurred at Memorial Medical Center,

37:26.038 --> 37:27.748
they were homicides.

37:28.707 --> 37:32.127
If that's the case, sir,
then why didn't the grand jury indict?

37:32.211 --> 37:35.839
Because they didn't hear directly
from any of these forensic experts.

37:35.923 --> 37:39.218
-Why not?
-You'll have to ask the DA that.

37:39.301 --> 37:42.346
Do you think it's fair to judge Dr. Pou
on the decisions she made

37:42.429 --> 37:45.182
given the incredibly horrific conditions
that existed?

37:45.265 --> 37:47.100
I refuse to accept that the conditions

37:47.184 --> 37:49.686
were any excuse
for the taking of a human life.

37:50.437 --> 37:53.357
What is the value of a human life?

37:54.399 --> 37:57.653
What conditions can possibly justify
the taking of human lives?

37:57.736 --> 38:00.030
These are the questions
that this case raises.

38:00.113 --> 38:04.785
So, no. I do not believe
in any way, shape or form

38:04.868 --> 38:07.496
that the grand jury
reached the right conclusion.

38:14.962 --> 38:15.963
Butch?

38:17.965 --> 38:19.132
Are you okay?

38:19.216 --> 38:20.717
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

38:26.056 --> 38:28.267
Hon, I know you don't like
to discuss your cases,

38:28.350 --> 38:33.105
butâ€¦
I'm sorry this one didn't go your way.

38:35.315 --> 38:39.778
That hospital,
it wasn't a damn battlefield

38:39.862 --> 38:42.573
with mortar shells coming in.
It was a shelter.

38:42.656 --> 38:46.076
They had food and water and rescue boats.

38:47.578 --> 38:51.582
Wouldn't somebody rather risk
getting carried downstairs

38:51.665 --> 38:54.918
or, hell, lowered out a window,
rather than not try at all?

38:55.002 --> 38:56.712
Why would you not at least try
to get him out?

38:57.796 --> 39:01.383
If you're a doctor, you get to just decide
who lives and who dies?

39:01.466 --> 39:02.926
If you feel like giving your patients

39:03.010 --> 39:05.137
huge doses of morphine
and Versed cocktail,

39:05.220 --> 39:06.221
that's your call?

39:10.350 --> 39:12.060
And how do you ignore the fact

39:12.144 --> 39:15.314
that other people were evacuating people

39:15.397 --> 39:18.066
at the same time
that you were "giving comfort"?

39:25.949 --> 39:27.201
These poor people.

39:30.078 --> 39:33.207
These poor folks, they had no idea
what was happening to them.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.962
They had no way of defending themselves.

39:42.883 --> 39:48.305
This really hurts, Lin.
Lin, this really hurts.

39:49.389 --> 39:50.432
I know.

40:03.403 --> 40:05.405
I wanted to make sure you got this back.

40:11.453 --> 40:13.372
I wish we could've done
a better job for you.

40:14.248 --> 40:15.707
Wasn't your fault.

40:16.375 --> 40:20.712
Dr. Pou and all those people with power,
they lined up right behind her.

40:22.631 --> 40:29.555
Emmett. He was my high school sweetheart.

40:31.640 --> 40:35.018
I met him when I needed a date
to the junior prom.

40:36.520 --> 40:40.440
He was the brother of a friend of mine,
and I'd seen him sitting on the porch.

40:41.525 --> 40:43.110
So I said to my friend,

40:43.193 --> 40:45.696
"Go ask your brother
if he wanna take me to the prom."

40:47.739 --> 40:48.782
And he did.

40:50.868 --> 40:51.869
Emmett.

40:52.870 --> 40:55.539
He used to say to me,
"Girl, you gonna be my wife."

40:56.540 --> 41:01.420
And I said, "Boy, you'd be
the last person on Earth I'd marry."

41:02.379 --> 41:03.714
Just to throw him off.

41:06.383 --> 41:10.679
He was the most loving,
caring man I have ever met.

41:12.055 --> 41:13.473
I wish I could've met him.

41:17.144 --> 41:20.189
There ain't
no statute of limitations on murder.

41:21.773 --> 41:27.696
I've been waiting a long time for justice.
I can wait a little while longer.

41:43.795 --> 41:47.257
Hey, look at this.
It's the Ghost of Christmas Past.

41:47.841 --> 41:49.760
Yeah. Still haunting you.

41:50.636 --> 41:52.554
Just came by to get the rest of my things.

41:53.472 --> 41:55.349
No one's taken your spot out front, I see.

41:56.308 --> 41:58.560
Yeah, just taking a quiet five.

42:01.230 --> 42:03.649
I guess you were smart
to get out when you did, huh?

42:05.400 --> 42:07.444
Doesn't make it any easier to stomach.

42:11.573 --> 42:14.034
Pardon my French, but what the fuck
happened in there?

42:16.245 --> 42:19.873
Among other things,
they never called Kristy Johnson.

42:21.250 --> 42:22.251
What?

42:23.043 --> 42:25.295
How do you not call
the eyewitness to a murder?

42:25.379 --> 42:26.713
And it doesn't look like any

42:26.797 --> 42:29.633
of the outside forensic experts
testified, either.

42:29.716 --> 42:30.926
What were they thinking?

42:31.635 --> 42:34.054
That is a profound question.

42:36.306 --> 42:41.353
But the records of the special grand jury
are permanently sealed,

42:41.436 --> 42:42.646
so we'll never know.

42:44.857 --> 42:47.734
I can't help but think that
we fucked up by just going after Pou.

42:49.486 --> 42:56.034
It was a river of evidence that flowed
a certain way, and we had to follow it.

42:57.369 --> 42:58.745
Led us right to Pou.

42:59.246 --> 43:03.625
Yeah, to a doctor who was exemplary
in every way. Except for when she wasn't.

43:09.256 --> 43:10.299
Onward.

43:13.802 --> 43:15.512
I'm glad I ran into you, Butch.

43:16.096 --> 43:17.097
Me too.

43:19.391 --> 43:21.143
You take care of yourself, Virginia.

43:22.895 --> 43:23.896
Bye.

43:58.263 --> 43:59.556
Ladies and gentlemen

44:00.265 --> 44:03.519
it is my privilege tonight

44:03.602 --> 44:08.315
to introduce our guest of honor,
Dr. Anna Pou.

44:08.398 --> 44:11.443
Whoo! Yeah!

44:15.447 --> 44:18.408
Thank you. Thank y'all very much.

44:19.576 --> 44:24.915
Thank you. I'm just gonna
make a few very brief remarks.

44:26.625 --> 44:28.085
None of us here in this room

44:28.168 --> 44:31.713
will ever forget
what happened during Katrina.

44:31.797 --> 44:33.674
We each have our own stories to tell.

44:34.758 --> 44:38.971
What happened to me
inside Memorial Hospitalâ€¦

44:41.723 --> 44:43.141
is hard to describe.

44:44.226 --> 44:48.856
The heat, the stench, the lack of power,

44:49.481 --> 44:52.609
the chaos as we tried
to evacuate the patients.

44:53.360 --> 44:58.949
Then on Wednesday the evacuation
stopped. They just stopped.

44:59.032 --> 45:01.410
We don't know why. No one told us why.

45:02.244 --> 45:03.745
Then on Thursday,

45:03.829 --> 45:08.625
we were told that everyone
must be out of the hospital today.

45:08.709 --> 45:12.212
And after five sleepless days and nights,
FEMA called, said,

45:12.796 --> 45:14.506
"We're taking all the airboats at noon,

45:14.590 --> 45:18.427
so whoever you can get
out of the hospital, get them out by then,

45:18.510 --> 45:20.888
because they can no longer stay inside."

45:21.847 --> 45:23.765
The Coast Guard sent helicopters,

45:23.849 --> 45:27.394
but they didn't arrive
until Thursday afternoon.

45:29.479 --> 45:31.940
I should note something
that I didn't know.

45:32.774 --> 45:35.360
Coast Guard helicopters
can't fly at night.

45:38.447 --> 45:44.912
We did not get the type of support
that we needed to evacuate patients.

45:45.412 --> 45:46.413
Far from it.

45:46.496 --> 45:48.916
We were left on our own

45:48.999 --> 45:55.339
by local, state and federal governments
that totally failed us.

45:55.422 --> 45:57.049
We were abandoned.

45:59.927 --> 46:02.638
We were abandoned.

46:05.432 --> 46:07.226
Now, I'm just a doctor.

46:10.187 --> 46:16.735
The duty to care sounds easy.
Sounds great.

46:17.277 --> 46:21.240
But in practice, it is not always so.

46:23.951 --> 46:29.164
I know in my heart that every single one
of us in that hospital

46:29.873 --> 46:33.836
did everything we could
to comfort and to care.

46:33.919 --> 46:38.215
No one was abandoned.
No one was neglected.

46:39.424 --> 46:42.344
And everybody was treated with dignity.

46:43.303 --> 46:49.977
And although my life was changed forever
on July 17th, 2006, the day of my arrest,

46:50.060 --> 46:54.022
I do not look upon my circumstances
with bitterness,

46:54.898 --> 46:58.527
because God has been really phenomenal.

46:59.194 --> 47:05.325
And he sent me so many people
to help me through this. He did.

47:05.409 --> 47:07.536
He sent my friendsâ€¦

47:10.247 --> 47:13.750
my family, my patients,

47:14.334 --> 47:17.880
nurses, my fellow doctors.

47:17.963 --> 47:21.091
I see so many of you
sitting here in this very room.

47:22.926 --> 47:25.304
I wouldn't be here without all of you.

47:25.888 --> 47:28.891
The courage and the strength
that you have given me

47:28.974 --> 47:30.517
are truly a gift from God.

47:31.935 --> 47:34.855
So your love and the greatness of God,

47:34.938 --> 47:37.232
that is what got me
out of bed every morning.

47:37.774 --> 47:41.028
I consider myself
one of the luckiest people in the world

47:41.111 --> 47:44.114
because of your support.
And for that, I thank you.

47:44.198 --> 47:45.199
Yeah!

47:46.033 --> 47:50.787
Thank you very much
from the bottom of my heart. Thank you.

47:53.498 --> 47:55.209
Thank you.

48:00.797 --> 48:03.383
Thank you. Thank you.

48:39.294 --> 48:40.629
-Hello, Anna.
-Horace.

48:41.588 --> 48:42.923
I'm so happy to see you here.

48:43.465 --> 48:44.591
How's Vince?

48:45.175 --> 48:46.301
He's good. Where is he?

48:47.135 --> 48:50.180
-He's over there dancing.
-Yeah.

48:52.224 --> 48:54.309
Ready to cut loose after this last year.

48:55.519 --> 48:56.770
I can only imagine.

48:56.854 --> 48:59.273
It's been surreal, Horace.

48:59.356 --> 49:00.691
It's been surreal.

49:00.774 --> 49:03.068
It's-- That is the only way
that I can describe it.

49:07.781 --> 49:13.078
Anna, FEMA didn't take away the airboats.

49:13.745 --> 49:16.081
They were run by volunteers.

49:17.875 --> 49:23.422
And they couldn't have called us to tell
us, because our phones weren't working.

49:25.215 --> 49:31.513
And you do know that the Coast Guard
helicopters did fly at night.

49:32.014 --> 49:34.183
They used night-vision goggles.

49:35.392 --> 49:36.977
They made rescues throughout.

49:37.060 --> 49:40.814
It wasn't as if the Coast Guard
didn't try to save patients.

49:40.898 --> 49:44.151
Horace. They didn't fly at night.

49:47.613 --> 49:49.072
Ask Vince. He's a pilot.

49:49.156 --> 49:52.117
Anna, I was at Memorial too.

49:53.577 --> 49:58.415
Just because you remember things one way,
doesn't make them true.

50:07.049 --> 50:08.133
Man.

50:12.846 --> 50:14.097
I wish you well.
