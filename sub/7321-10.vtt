00:11.244 --> 00:13.109
<i>My mother called</i>
<i>it the greatest</i>

00:13.179 --> 00:15.374
<i>and most terrifying moment in her life.</i>

00:22.355 --> 00:23.822
He said Karev.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.724
<i>Standing at the head</i>
<i>of the surgical table,</i>

00:26.760 --> 00:30.321
<i>knowing that the patient's life</i>
<i>depends on you and you alone.</i>

00:30.363 --> 00:31.853
- He said Karev!
- Yes!

00:31.898 --> 00:34.162
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.361
You're "sure" sure?

00:39.572 --> 00:41.233
Huh.

00:42.442 --> 00:44.672
<i>It's what we all dream about.</i>

00:49.149 --> 00:53.643
<i>Because the first person</i>
<i>that gets to fly solo in the OR?</i>

00:53.686 --> 00:55.620
<i>Kind of a badass.</i>

00:59.926 --> 01:03.453
- Stevens! He said Stevens!
- Which is it, moron?

01:03.496 --> 01:05.828
- Stevens or Karev?
- This is stupid.

01:05.865 --> 01:08.766
Trust imbeciles to tell you
who's getting solo surgery?

01:08.802 --> 01:11.771
Is this hard for you,
being banned from the solo surgery?

01:11.805 --> 01:15.707
- It must be really hard for you.
- A mean streak. I like it.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.540
He may change his mind.
He's been known to change.

01:18.578 --> 01:22.480
Don't do that. Go ahead
and will yourselves to be voted in.

01:22.515 --> 01:24.915
- Use the Secret.
- Grey!

01:24.951 --> 01:26.282
The Chief said Grey.

01:27.787 --> 01:30.915
- What?! This is bogus.
- You just figuring that out?

01:30.957 --> 01:34.950
Steve is not a lip reader.
None of the interns are lip readers.

01:34.994 --> 01:39.829
You have to wait for the attendings
to vote, just like we did when I won.

01:39.866 --> 01:43.700
- You won your solo surgery?
- I'm gonna pretend you didn't

01:43.736 --> 01:47.604
feel the need to ask me that, Yang.
Of course I won. I was good.

01:47.640 --> 01:52.577
I didn't cut LVAD wires or put
my hand in bomb-y body cavities

01:52.612 --> 01:57.015
or have my interns operating
on themselves. I was special.

01:57.050 --> 02:00.747
I was young, gifted and black,
and everybody knew it.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.051
The attendings knew it,
the Chief knew it.

02:03.089 --> 02:06.957
I didn't have to act
like I could read lips.

02:06.993 --> 02:10.019
Just go about my work calmly,

02:10.062 --> 02:12.122
waiting for my name to get called.

02:12.765 --> 02:14.027
It's done!

02:15.568 --> 02:18.435
- Whatever, Helen Keller.
- No, I'm serious.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.962
The Chief sent me.
They made their choice.

02:21.007 --> 02:22.372
Who is it?

02:29.983 --> 02:31.610
It's you.

02:38.124 --> 02:43.221
I am happy to announce that the first
solo surgery will take place tonight.

02:43.263 --> 02:45.959
A below-the-knee amputation,
bone cancer...

02:45.999 --> 02:49.059
- Poor bastard.
- No appy?

02:49.102 --> 02:52.663
- Saw action, sweet.
- Choosing who gets first solo surgery

02:52.705 --> 02:55.538
isn't just about
who has the best surgical skills

02:55.575 --> 02:58.237
or who's logged
the most hours in the OR.

02:58.278 --> 03:01.304
It's about the highest form of trust.

03:01.347 --> 03:05.306
The trust to put a patient's life
into one of our resident's hands.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.546
And for the first time
that I can recall,

03:07.587 --> 03:11.216
every single attending
picked the same person:

03:11.257 --> 03:12.724
Dr. Yang.

03:12.759 --> 03:17.924
However, Dr. Yang is out of the running.
She is going to pick the winner instead.

03:17.964 --> 03:21.491
Dr. Yang will post her decision
on the OR board at 4:00pm.

03:21.534 --> 03:25.868
Also, since your interns
are still banned from the OR,

03:25.905 --> 03:30.274
the winner will pick a fellow resident
to scrub in with them. Good luck.

03:31.444 --> 03:33.810
This is torture for me.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.081
I'm not even done.

03:37.116 --> 03:39.209
- Sir?
- Dr. Dixon is back.

03:39.252 --> 03:43.450
You'll be spending the day with her.
You will impress her.

03:43.489 --> 03:46.253
You will make sure
this hospital impresses her.

03:46.292 --> 03:49.693
By end of the day, I want that woman
to be my next head of Cardio.

03:49.729 --> 03:53.529
If she's not, I'll know who to blame.
Good luck.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.558
We held a retractor
for 12 hours together.

03:56.603 --> 03:59.800
You said I had small hands.
Good for surgery. Remember?

03:59.839 --> 04:01.306
No. Go away.

04:01.341 --> 04:05.300
- I operated on a heart in an elevator.
- Over a year ago. O'Malley's 007.

04:05.345 --> 04:08.508
Think how poor your decision would look
if you gave it to him.

04:08.548 --> 04:09.810
Your turn.

04:09.849 --> 04:12.283
I don't know why you
are even bothering.

04:12.318 --> 04:15.253
- We know who she's gonna pick.
- She's not gonna pick me

04:15.288 --> 04:18.779
because I'm her best friend.
She'll pick me because I'm the best.

04:18.825 --> 04:21.385
Stop! Are you guys kidding me?

04:24.163 --> 04:26.461
Fine. I'll think about it.

04:26.499 --> 04:29.491
Just... go and do surgical things.

04:30.336 --> 04:34.067
Are you coming?
We gotta go do clinic. Flu season fun.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.938
Yeah.

04:35.975 --> 04:39.672
I... will catch up with you.

04:39.712 --> 04:41.043
- Me, too.
- Shut up.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.574
Not you.

04:45.618 --> 04:48.246
My head. Shut up!

04:52.692 --> 04:54.956
When I win, you can scrub in for me.

04:54.994 --> 04:57.622
Alex, she's not...
not gonna pick you.

04:57.664 --> 05:01.532
I'll scrub in for you, too, if you win,
which you won't. 'Cause I will.

05:02.168 --> 05:06.571
- Enough!
- I... I gotta go.

05:09.709 --> 05:14.271
Cristina still hasn't talked to me.
Which is normal. Except it's worse.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.477
Two weeks suspension
and she hasn't said one mean thing.

05:17.517 --> 05:20.975
Karev called me a moron.
Which is good.

05:21.020 --> 05:24.353
- Residents don't look at me.
- Least they could do is hate us.

05:24.390 --> 05:26.654
I'm gonna get some sex.

05:26.693 --> 05:30.026
- Sex always makes me feel better.
- Don't look at me.

05:30.063 --> 05:33.430
- Me, neither.
- That makes three of us.

05:39.739 --> 05:41.229
Hi.

05:41.274 --> 05:42.707
I get it.

05:42.742 --> 05:46.143
I organized a crazy cabal
of secret cutter interns.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.875
The thing is,
I've been advised to seek out sex

05:48.915 --> 05:54.581
as a way out of my sad predicament,
but I'd rather just learn today, so...

05:54.620 --> 05:57.680
...what do you say? You, me...

05:57.724 --> 06:01.216
Why are you talking about sex?
Inappropriate. I'm your teacher.

06:01.260 --> 06:04.661
I have things to teach.
Double board-certified things.

06:04.697 --> 06:08.098
That's... That's what I was
talking about. For you to teach me.

06:08.134 --> 06:11.035
Medicine. The sex...
That was a joke.

06:11.070 --> 06:16.269
Dr. Sloan, I heard you're performing
a hypopharynx reconstruction today.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.675
- I'm gonna make a woman speak.
- Let's hope.

06:18.711 --> 06:21.942
- I read up on the surgery...
- You read up on my surgery?

06:21.981 --> 06:26.111
Since it's your first time performing
what is a cutting-edge surgery,

06:26.152 --> 06:28.882
I was hoping you might need
an extra set of hands.

06:28.921 --> 06:33.358
- Fine. You can join Dr. Grey and me.
- Dr. Grey who is banned from the OR?

06:33.393 --> 06:34.985
She's on cappuccino duty.

06:35.027 --> 06:39.396
- Which I'm still waiting for.
- Right away. Thank you.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.467
Dr. Virginia Dixon. It says she
arrived over half an hour ago!

06:46.506 --> 06:48.565
- Where is she?
- Nervous?

06:48.608 --> 06:52.408
What are you doing here? This is
cardio wing. Only cardio gods allowed.

06:52.478 --> 06:56.312
I know. I'm looking around, getting
to know other parts of the hospital.

06:56.349 --> 07:00.046
What else is there? The OR, the ER
and the place with the food.

07:00.086 --> 07:03.078
Somebody's got a lot to learn.

07:03.122 --> 07:06.717
Kathleen Patterson. Laryngectomy
five years ago resulted in loss

07:06.793 --> 07:09.819
of her ability to speak.
Undergone surgical attempts

07:09.862 --> 07:13.127
to restore her voice in the past.
None have been successful.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.932
This time, though, this time
we have a good feeling about this.

07:16.969 --> 07:19.631
Right, honey?

07:21.841 --> 07:25.675
As discussed, I'll get blood supply
from your arm, cartilage from...

07:26.846 --> 07:28.143
...from your...

07:28.181 --> 07:29.808
Kathleen?

07:29.849 --> 07:31.282
Honey?

07:33.319 --> 07:34.616
Honey.

07:35.822 --> 07:37.346
You can talk to me.

07:37.390 --> 07:40.518
I'll get skin and blood from her arm,
cartilage from her nose

07:40.560 --> 07:44.462
to construct a speaking tube
which will become her new voicebox.

07:44.497 --> 07:48.365
You should be aware there's a chance
the procedure might not work.

07:48.401 --> 07:51.268
- He's clear on that.
- I'm just reminding him

07:51.304 --> 07:52.601
not to get his hopes up.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.967
Any other questions I can answer?

07:59.512 --> 08:01.776
Kathleen? Honey?

08:04.817 --> 08:06.876
Tell me everything
to know about Karev.

08:06.919 --> 08:08.546
- Why?
- I'm his intern.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.522
He seems cool enough at your house.

08:10.556 --> 08:14.151
Whatever he's got going with the girl
who masturbates all the time...

08:14.193 --> 08:15.683
I don't like to judge.

08:15.728 --> 08:18.891
Still, officially, I'm his intern,
so what's his deal?

08:18.931 --> 08:22.731
Sadie, I can't be your friend in here.
I'm a resident, you're an intern.

08:22.768 --> 08:26.864
You have to figure out how not
to piss off Alex Karev yourself.

08:26.906 --> 08:28.635
- OK. I get it.
- Good.

08:28.674 --> 08:31.575
...and ugly! It wasn't my fault!

08:31.611 --> 08:33.909
I had to tell those guys
where to meet us!

08:33.946 --> 08:36.710
I said I'd do it that way
you could drive! I'm telling!

08:36.749 --> 08:39.047
- I'll kill you!
- You need to calm down.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.712
- Tell her!
- Shut up!

08:40.753 --> 08:43.722
- What happened?
- Sisters, 16 and 15, crashed dad's car.

08:43.756 --> 08:47.248
All we know since they won't
stop screaming. We need your names.

08:47.293 --> 08:50.854
- Don't tell her. Don't say a word.
- Her name is Holly Anderson.

08:50.897 --> 08:53.866
She was driving. And texting.
While driving!

08:53.900 --> 08:56.266
Is there an officer?
I want to press charges.

08:56.302 --> 08:59.328
- You suck-up! Suck-up assface!
- We need your number

08:59.372 --> 09:03.069
- so we can call your parents.
- Here. I speed-dialed my dad.

09:03.109 --> 09:05.168
- You are such a bitch!
- No, you are!

09:05.211 --> 09:07.941
- Make it stop.
- Shut up!

09:13.085 --> 09:16.782
You are dead when Mom and Dad show
up. The doctors will save you again.

09:16.822 --> 09:18.949
- I hate you!
- I hate you more!

09:18.991 --> 09:21.425
- I hate you both.
- ...all the time!

09:21.460 --> 09:24.020
- So easy, OK?
- Come on!

09:33.839 --> 09:38.037
I know you still see me as 007,
but that was day one.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.807
I've grown a lot since then,
and learned a lot.

09:40.846 --> 09:44.782
Anyone can have brains,
or anyone can have talent,

09:44.817 --> 09:46.250
but the key is to grow.

09:46.285 --> 09:50.187
So, sure, I had a rough start and I
had to re-do some of my intern year,

09:50.222 --> 09:53.714
but I came out the other side,

09:53.759 --> 09:55.784
smarter, better.

09:55.828 --> 09:58.854
The important point is I never gave up.

09:58.898 --> 10:01.458
Because I'm a fighter.

10:06.572 --> 10:08.631
Thank you.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.419
I have to check your X-rays,
I think your leg is broken.

10:20.486 --> 10:24.479
- You'll be off it for a while.
- No. No!

10:24.523 --> 10:28.289
I can't miss my Future Leaders
of America conference! Holly!

10:28.327 --> 10:30.852
Emma, I'm gonna be grounded
till graduation.

10:30.896 --> 10:34.593
I was going to D.C.! I've been
waiting for this for a year!

10:34.634 --> 10:37.831
Mom and Dad spent two grand,
they've now wasted two grand!

10:37.870 --> 10:40.896
- You stupid baby!
- I'm separating you two.

10:43.809 --> 10:46.243
Listen, I've been here. Lots.

10:46.278 --> 10:49.270
Your dad won't be pissed.
He'll be happy you're safe.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.647
He'll kill me.
He'll take away everything.

10:51.684 --> 10:54.619
How long have her eyes been like that?

10:54.654 --> 10:56.417
- Her eyes?
- Page Shepherd.

10:56.455 --> 10:59.720
She might have a basilar skull fracture.
Get her up to CT now!

10:59.759 --> 11:01.317
- I didn't see...
- Do scut.

11:01.394 --> 11:04.295
I'll call you when she needs
another pep talk.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.890
- Where's she going?
- Just to run a few tests.

11:06.932 --> 11:09.560
Good, get her out of here.
Take her away!

11:09.602 --> 11:11.570
I hope you die!

11:21.914 --> 11:24.849
- Oh, crap.
- Somebody's in big trouble.

11:24.884 --> 11:28.445
- Did you forget to open it or staff it?
- Both.

11:28.487 --> 11:32.014
I'm sorry, everybody.
I'll be right back with the keys.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.492
Might want to get nurses
while you're at it.

11:34.527 --> 11:38.088
This happen a lot? If it does,
you're giving my clinic a bad name.

11:38.130 --> 11:41.327
You're mocking me now?
Sweet, very sweet.

11:47.573 --> 11:51.065
Dr. Dixon, there you are.
I'm Dr. Yang.

11:51.110 --> 11:56.173
We... I've been assigned to work with
you today. I was in the cardio lab.

11:56.215 --> 11:59.446
- Sorry it took me so long.
- There's a blank spot on this board.

11:59.518 --> 12:03.249
There's a surgery but no surgeon.
I would like to do a surgery,

12:03.289 --> 12:08.750
but that's an amputation and I haven't
done an amputation since residency.

12:11.764 --> 12:14.494
Well...

12:14.533 --> 12:18.333
...that's... really hard to...
That...

12:18.370 --> 12:20.998
Is your stuttering pathological
and persistent

12:21.040 --> 12:23.565
or is it occasional and stress-related?

12:23.609 --> 12:27.568
- I don't stutter.
- I had pathological stuttering

12:27.613 --> 12:32.516
as a child, but it can be treated
with rigorous speech therapy.

12:32.551 --> 12:34.280
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.883
Why is this slot on the board blank?

12:38.924 --> 12:43.122
I need to select one of my fellow
residents for that slot.

12:43.162 --> 12:45.255
It's the first solo surgery of my class.

12:45.297 --> 12:48.391
The Chief asked you to choose
from your peers?

12:48.434 --> 12:49.492
Yes, ma'am.

12:58.511 --> 13:01.878
Mr. Patterson, I have some forms
for your wife to fill out.

13:01.914 --> 13:05.748
- Is now a good time?
- She's a blogger.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.618
About cancer and voicelessness.

13:08.654 --> 13:11.851
She's famous in certain
Internet circles.

13:11.891 --> 13:14.587
It seems like you two have
a great system going here.

13:14.627 --> 13:19.360
- You've learned to communicate.
- You mean the Post-its?

13:19.398 --> 13:22.697
You think that's a pretty great system?

13:22.735 --> 13:24.726
I... it's...

13:24.770 --> 13:28.672
- ...convenient?
- Yes. No. Hello. I love you.

13:30.409 --> 13:34.243
You read the words long enough,
they begin to lose their meaning.

13:36.816 --> 13:40.752
Mid-shaft transverse tibia fracture?
Hi. Sorry to barge in.

13:40.786 --> 13:44.153
I was just walking by,
and I saw broken bones.

13:44.190 --> 13:46.283
I love broken bones.

13:46.325 --> 13:49.385
Less than five degrees
of angulation, right?

13:49.428 --> 13:51.225
Yeah, it...

13:51.263 --> 13:55.962
We can treat it with closed
reduction and casting.

13:56.001 --> 13:59.835
Flexion <i>I</i> extension views
of the cervical spine?

14:01.207 --> 14:02.902
Yes.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.341
I should go see my patient.

14:07.746 --> 14:09.179
Chair.

14:12.885 --> 14:16.252
She's got a hemopericardium.
Let Cardio know.

14:16.288 --> 14:19.587
Hey. I've got a Future Leader outside,
she needs a CT.

14:19.625 --> 14:22.992
- Hey.
- I'm not mad for not voting for me.

14:23.028 --> 14:26.327
- It would look like playing favorites.
- You deserve it. Cristina knows,

14:26.365 --> 14:29.664
- even if you two are fighting.
- You and Yang are fighting?

14:29.702 --> 14:31.761
We're not fighting.
Fought. Past tense.

14:31.804 --> 14:33.829
How bad is it? Real bad?

14:35.007 --> 14:36.304
She's crashing.

14:36.942 --> 14:41.345
<i>Code blue, fourth floor.</i>
<i>Code blue, fourth floor.</i>

14:42.748 --> 14:45.546
Brain matter in her blood.
Let OR know we're coming.

14:45.584 --> 14:49.281
What happened to her? Holly? Holly!

14:51.757 --> 14:53.247
Holly!

14:53.292 --> 14:57.752
What did you do to my sister?
Holly! Holly! What did you do to her?

15:05.871 --> 15:09.637
Hey. So you know I deserve this.

15:10.809 --> 15:13.471
You know I'm the most qualified.

15:13.512 --> 15:16.208
But I don't want it to be
a big awkward thing.

15:16.248 --> 15:20.582
I don't. So, just,
you do what you have to do.

15:20.619 --> 15:25.553
OK.

15:25.591 --> 15:26.819
I'll see you later.

15:31.330 --> 15:34.697
- Almost done here, Emma.
- Holly will be all right, right?

15:34.733 --> 15:37.793
- She's gonna be OK?
- She got into surgery quick.

15:37.836 --> 15:39.827
- That's good.
- Are my parents here?

15:39.872 --> 15:43.171
- They're coming. Your dad...
- Holly's gonna be all right?

15:43.208 --> 15:47.076
She's not in, like...
She won't die?

15:47.112 --> 15:50.309
- Emma, you didn't mean it.
- I said, "I hope you die."

15:50.349 --> 15:53.807
That can't be the last thing
she heard me say. It can't.

15:53.852 --> 15:56.650
Just don't let her die. Please.

15:59.925 --> 16:03.019
All right, I'll go to the OR
and get an update for you. OK?

16:03.062 --> 16:04.290
OK.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.193
Be objective, Dr. Yang.

16:11.236 --> 16:15.605
Consider accomplishments, achievements,
look for the stand-outs.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.735
Let's see what kind of stand-out
Karev proves himself to be

16:18.777 --> 16:22.178
- when I ask him to sew the graft.
- Really?

16:22.247 --> 16:26.684
Absolutely. Dr. Yang, watch Karev
to see if his skills are up to par

16:26.719 --> 16:29.517
- for the solo.
- A system! Devise a system.

16:29.555 --> 16:31.819
Rank everyone accordingly.
That's all.

16:31.857 --> 16:34.052
Thank you.

16:37.429 --> 16:39.192
- Out of the way.
- What happened?

16:39.231 --> 16:40.721
Her brain's changing color.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.256
She's hemorrhaging.
100 of mannitol.

16:42.301 --> 16:44.769
What did I do? What did I do?

16:47.072 --> 16:49.597
OK, OK. So the new intern,
Meredith's friend?

16:49.641 --> 16:52.075
- Psycho with no appendix?
- Yeah. We talked.

16:52.111 --> 16:55.342
She came to talk to me.
But it was more than that, you know?

16:55.381 --> 16:58.782
A guy looks at you a certain way,
eyes wander when he talks to you.

16:58.817 --> 17:01.547
Bam, you know. This girl thing,
it's confusing.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.316
- Was there touching?
- No.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.323
- Was there playing with the hair?
- No.

17:05.357 --> 17:08.588
- Was there licking of the lips?
- Oh, my God.

17:08.627 --> 17:12.529
I made it up because I'm lonely
and depressed and desperate

17:12.564 --> 17:14.555
for attention from the hot new intern.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.864
- Crazy new intern.
- Crazy hot.

17:16.902 --> 17:20.269
No. The hot ones are the ones
that cause trouble,

17:20.305 --> 17:23.468
ones that distract you from
realizing your true potential.

17:23.509 --> 17:27.036
You need to focus on the medicine.
Take that pent up sexual energy

17:27.112 --> 17:29.808
you waste thinking
about hot, naked interns

17:29.848 --> 17:33.716
and put it back into your genius,
your godliness.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.582
Build someone an organ. That's hot.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.557
She smiled.
Did I mention she smiled?

17:39.591 --> 17:40.922
No hot interns!

17:43.295 --> 17:47.595
Then we'll insert the newly constructed
tube in between her trachea

17:47.633 --> 17:50.898
and esophagus just... like...

17:50.936 --> 17:52.062
...that.

17:52.104 --> 17:55.073
So this valve flips open
when she has air...

17:55.107 --> 17:58.599
You're in my space! Back up!
Just back the hell up!

17:58.644 --> 18:01.579
Dr. Bailey, will you please
find Dr. Grey something to do

18:01.613 --> 18:03.945
- other than interfere?
- Dr. Grey?

18:04.016 --> 18:07.110
Finish prepping
Mrs. Patterson for surgery.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.823
She was in my space.

18:16.228 --> 18:18.423
George, can you cover
for me for a while?

18:18.464 --> 18:21.922
- We're swamped.
- There's something I need to do.

18:21.967 --> 18:25.061
- It's pressing.
- She doesn't want to miss hot sex.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.470
- Izzie!
- It's the clinic.

18:27.506 --> 18:29.406
You can handle the clinic.

18:30.309 --> 18:34.040
You're lucky she even showed up.
She hasn't been here all week.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.340
- Dr. Shepherd...
- It wasn't you.

18:38.383 --> 18:42.285
She had a carotid dissection.
Nothing we could have done.

18:42.321 --> 18:44.448
- So we can't...
- She had a massive CVA.

18:44.490 --> 18:47.459
Blood to her brain was cut off
and cannot be restored.

18:47.493 --> 18:51.156
So even though Dr. Shepherd
was able to fix the hole

18:51.196 --> 18:54.256
in her brain that allowed
tissue to leak through her nose,

18:54.299 --> 18:59.293
the subsequent carotid dissection has
caused loss of her cerebral function.

18:59.338 --> 19:02.171
- You do understand that?
- She's brain dead. I get it.

19:07.679 --> 19:10.409
She's only 16.

19:14.686 --> 19:18.713
That's good news. She'll be an
excellent candidate for organ donation.

19:18.757 --> 19:22.352
Excellent candidate.
Excellent organs. Young.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.137
Dude.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.076
You were robbed.
You got screwed by politics.

19:39.111 --> 19:42.103
The Chief, he needed a scapegoat.
It's so unfair.

19:43.849 --> 19:47.808
I'm sorry. I can't do this.
I can kiss ass when I have to.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.821
But not yours.

19:49.855 --> 19:53.256
incision at mid shaft of the tibia.

19:53.292 --> 19:55.988
Elevate the periosteum
and cut the tibia with saw.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.428
Ligate bundles
and release tourniquet.

19:58.463 --> 20:01.796
one on a cadaver, three on Stan.

20:05.304 --> 20:09.104
- Know who you're gonna pick?
- I'm ranking them.

20:09.141 --> 20:12.770
According to a system. Surgical skills,
hours in the OR,

20:12.811 --> 20:15.336
published papers,
academic accomplishments.

20:15.380 --> 20:18.679
You know them, their capabilities.
Go with your gut.

20:18.717 --> 20:22.676
My gut? I'm not putting a patient's life
in the hands of a novice surgeon

20:22.721 --> 20:25.713
- based on my gut.
- Well, it worked for me.

20:25.757 --> 20:26.951
Your gut?

20:28.493 --> 20:30.586
It's what told me to choose you.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.825
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:38.971 --> 20:41.405
- Beautiful.
- What?

20:41.440 --> 20:46.901
- Your necklace.
- Oh, right. Um...

20:49.248 --> 20:52.240
- I have to go.
- See ya.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.890
I hope you didn't page me
to help pass out cough drops.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.984
- Ain't gonna happen.
- Where's Izzie?

21:02.027 --> 21:05.087
- I thought she was here.
- She's avoiding me.

21:05.130 --> 21:07.963
- What do you want me to do?
- You are together now?

21:08.000 --> 21:11.367
Talk to her. Find out why
she couldn't care about her clinic.

21:11.403 --> 21:14.133
You're pissed 'cause
you can't handle the flu.

21:14.172 --> 21:17.437
Something's wrong, Alex.
You need to talk to her.

21:17.476 --> 21:21.435
- She won't talk to me.
- Don't talk to me about Izzie again.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.181
It's just George.

21:28.220 --> 21:31.189
Your friends, they're out
there fighting for a chance

21:31.223 --> 21:34.590
to chop of that guy's leg.
What is that, anyway?

21:34.626 --> 21:38.062
It's how we learn. By doing.

21:38.096 --> 21:40.963
I lost my shot at the solo surgery
as soon as the Chief

21:40.999 --> 21:43.126
made it Cristina's decision.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.597
Anyway, there'll always be surgeries.

21:47.639 --> 21:50.733
There won't always be fiancés
who come back from the dead.

21:50.776 --> 21:52.607
Good point.

21:57.949 --> 22:00.850
Aren't you going
to deepithelialize here

22:00.886 --> 22:03.582
to connect it to the trachea?

22:03.622 --> 22:06.716
You're a very eager student, Dr. Bailey.

22:06.758 --> 22:09.989
- Very thorough.
- Any way I can be of service.

22:17.502 --> 22:21.461
- I'm not sorry.
- What?

22:21.506 --> 22:25.135
For what we did. It was extreme.
Maybe even stupid.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.737
But this program,
you should be down in that OR,

22:27.813 --> 22:31.112
not up here in the nosebleeds.
I shouldn't be spending my day

22:31.149 --> 22:34.050
transcribing Karev's
illegible handwriting.

22:34.086 --> 22:38.921
How is that teaching? They call me crazy
Sadie and God knows what other names,

22:38.957 --> 22:41.858
but that doesn't change
that this program is broken.

22:41.893 --> 22:45.624
The only time they bother with us is
if they think they can get us in bed.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.334
That's not true. Dr. Sloan
took the time to teach me,

22:49.368 --> 22:51.893
- and that wasn't about sex.
- He likes you.

22:51.937 --> 22:53.905
Who? Dr. Sloan?

22:53.939 --> 22:56.840
Don't tell me you haven't
noticed his eyes on your ass.

22:56.875 --> 23:01.141
- You are delusional.
- Is he cutting into her throat?

23:02.247 --> 23:04.078
Bloody hell.

23:08.954 --> 23:11.422
So I suppose
you'll use a strip test

23:11.456 --> 23:13.981
to confirm flow across the anastomosis?

23:14.059 --> 23:16.289
It can damage the endothelium.

23:16.895 --> 23:19.363
- But don't you need to...
- Dr. Bailey,

23:19.398 --> 23:22.834
would you rather do Patterson's surgery?
I can leave.

23:22.901 --> 23:27.531
Dr. Sloan, I wasn't...
questioning your surgical skills.

23:27.572 --> 23:32.566
I was just trying to learn.
Something exciting. Something new.

23:32.611 --> 23:37.776
Residents are fighting tooth and nail
for a chance to cut off a leg.

23:37.816 --> 23:41.411
What you've done here, you made
something where there was nothing.

23:41.453 --> 23:44.616
And... it's thrilling.

23:46.158 --> 23:48.319
I was just trying to learn.

23:50.195 --> 23:52.823
Thank you, Dr. Bailey.

23:53.965 --> 23:58.402
Would you take the flap veins
and join them to the internal jugular?

24:09.347 --> 24:12.839
She looks like she's sleeping.
Can I touch her?

24:12.884 --> 24:15.409
Yes, of course.

24:20.392 --> 24:21.654
Can she hear me?

24:23.662 --> 24:27.621
She can come out of it, right?
The coma?

24:27.666 --> 24:30.157
- People can do that?
- No, she can't.

24:30.202 --> 24:34.366
I'm very sorry for your loss. But tests
confirm that, although your sister's

24:34.406 --> 24:36.966
bodily functions are fine,
her brain is dead.

24:37.008 --> 24:40.205
She has no thoughts,
no emotions, no senses.

24:40.245 --> 24:45.205
I'm Dr. Dixon. I will be harvesting
your sister's organs

24:45.250 --> 24:48.811
- if your parents agree.
- Please, she's our baby.

24:48.854 --> 24:51.152
- We need time.
- I'm sorry for your loss.

24:51.189 --> 24:55.125
But her organs are young and vital.
They could save many lives.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.560
Wake up, Holly.

24:57.596 --> 25:00.360
Wake up, come on, wake up.

25:00.398 --> 25:04.232
I'm very sorry for your loss,
but your sister can't wake up.

25:04.269 --> 25:07.238
Her basic functions are gone.
Her brain is dead.

25:07.272 --> 25:11.732
Her body is alive but, unfortunately,
unfortunately, she is dead.

25:11.776 --> 25:14.506
Get out! You cannot have her.

25:14.546 --> 25:18.004
- And you cannot take her.
- Dr. Dixon, I think,

25:18.083 --> 25:20.244
I think they understand.

25:21.553 --> 25:23.248
I think you should go now.

25:26.391 --> 25:29.690
I have offended you,
but we are running out of time.

25:29.728 --> 25:31.161
Get out!

25:33.265 --> 25:35.495
Holly, wake up!

25:35.534 --> 25:38.560
Wake up, Holly!

25:38.603 --> 25:40.503
Holly, wake up!

25:40.539 --> 25:42.370
Holly, wake up, please!

25:59.624 --> 26:04.288
Have you ever had mind-blowing sex? The
kind of sex that makes you want to die?

26:04.329 --> 26:08.026
Just fall on the floor
and give up and die?

26:08.066 --> 26:11.365
'Cause this sex I'm having,
it's that good.

26:11.403 --> 26:15.669
It's the best sex I've ever had.
It's the best sex anybody's ever had.

26:15.707 --> 26:20.110
I don't know why anybody who's had
this sex would do anything but have sex.

26:20.145 --> 26:21.578
Izzie...

26:21.613 --> 26:25.606
You're gonna give the solo surgery
to Mer, which is typical and boring

26:25.650 --> 26:29.279
and slightly corrupt, but at
least I'm having really, really,

26:29.321 --> 26:32.256
really good sex.

26:35.527 --> 26:37.518
Just thought you should know.

26:41.933 --> 26:45.892
I know you're nervous.
It may feel strange at first,

26:45.937 --> 26:48.963
- but just give it a shot.
- You haven't forgotten.

26:49.007 --> 26:51.066
You can do it.

26:55.780 --> 26:59.147
No! No! No more!

26:59.184 --> 27:01.778
No more typing! No more Post-its!

27:01.820 --> 27:03.481
No!

27:03.521 --> 27:05.921
Talk to me. Talk to me, damn it!

27:05.957 --> 27:08.221
Talk to me!

27:11.062 --> 27:14.190
Maybe we should give her a little time.

27:18.003 --> 27:22.303
Maybe you should go, too.
Just go for a walk or a drive.

27:22.340 --> 27:26.868
- Just give her some space.
- I've given her five years of space.

27:34.753 --> 27:37.347
- It was my fault.
- Excuse me?

27:37.389 --> 27:41.723
What happened, the appy, it was
my fault. I knew what I was doing.

27:41.760 --> 27:44.854
So if you want to punish someone,
punish me, not Dr. Yang.

27:44.896 --> 27:48.491
You know who your father is
and he's why you're still here.

27:48.533 --> 27:52.264
So if I were you, I'd stop worrying
about whose fault the appy was

27:52.303 --> 27:55.397
and start figuring out what
I was gonna do to make up for it.

27:55.440 --> 27:58.603
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

28:04.582 --> 28:08.916
There are people dying right now.
There are people dying.

28:08.953 --> 28:12.150
- It's inappropriate.
- I'm sorry, it's almost 4:00.

28:12.190 --> 28:16.149
- I have to make this decision.
- I'm not talking about your system.

28:16.194 --> 28:19.789
I approve of your system.
I was talking about the brain dead girl.

28:19.831 --> 28:22.356
Can't hear her sister,
can't feel her hands.

28:22.400 --> 28:25.995
There are patients dying and those
organs would keep them alive.

28:26.037 --> 28:29.529
Leave feelings out of it.
Leave them out of the science.

28:29.574 --> 28:33.874
Leave them out of the decision-making
because people are dying as we speak.

29:07.746 --> 29:11.409
- Is she kidding?
- Congratulations.

29:11.449 --> 29:12.814
Whatever.

29:18.590 --> 29:22.458
- Interesting choice, Yang.
- He made the best case.

29:38.476 --> 29:41.070
Iz, I won.

29:41.980 --> 29:44.312
Hey. What time is it?

29:44.349 --> 29:47.147
Yang, she picked me
for the solo surgery!

29:47.185 --> 29:50.211
She did? That's amazing.

29:51.156 --> 29:52.316
I love you.

29:53.424 --> 29:55.858
- What?
- I love you.

29:55.894 --> 29:58.158
I friggin' love you.

29:58.196 --> 30:01.723
I just got the solo surgery and
the first thing I did is look for you.

30:01.766 --> 30:05.429
And you weren't there.
You're never there anymore.

30:05.470 --> 30:09.167
I've been thinking about it and
it might be 'cause you love me, too.

30:09.207 --> 30:13.166
And you're scared of that.
'Cause I screwed it up last time.

30:13.211 --> 30:15.543
- And 'cause Denny died and...
- Alex.

30:15.580 --> 30:19.710
Just listen.
You had that heart patient

30:19.751 --> 30:23.778
and it reminded you of how bad you
felt lying on that bathroom floor.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.814
I get that.
I get that you're scared.

30:26.858 --> 30:29.725
But you're not gonna have
to feel like that again.

30:29.761 --> 30:33.595
'Cause I'm not gonna die, Iz.
And I'm not gonna cheat on you.

30:33.631 --> 30:36.998
I'm not gonna go anywhere.

30:37.035 --> 30:40.004
'Cause...

30:40.071 --> 30:42.403
...I think you're my best shot at...

30:44.175 --> 30:47.542
I think with you, you make me better.

30:48.346 --> 30:52.407
You make me wanna be better.
You make me wanna be good.

30:52.450 --> 30:56.511
And I think I can.
With you, I think I can.

30:56.554 --> 30:59.114
I'm not going anywhere.
You can stop hiding.

30:59.157 --> 31:03.025
And if you want to be scared,
that's OK. Just be scared with me.

31:03.061 --> 31:06.895
Be scared while you scrub in with me
for my first solo surgery.

31:06.931 --> 31:10.924
- OK?
- You love me.

31:10.969 --> 31:12.527
Shut up.

31:18.443 --> 31:20.070
Solo surgery.

31:23.281 --> 31:25.613
I'm really starting
to not like that guy.

31:31.122 --> 31:35.115
I never should have said it.
I didn't mean it.

31:35.159 --> 31:37.354
I never should have said it.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.291
Tell her that.

31:40.331 --> 31:42.891
Tell her the last thing
you'd want her to hear.

31:42.934 --> 31:45.266
You have to believe
if it were you in this bed

31:45.303 --> 31:48.704
and Holly was with you,
feeling bad, you would forgive her.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.503
Tell her.

31:56.147 --> 31:57.842
I'm sorry.

32:00.385 --> 32:02.683
I'm so sorry.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.522
I love you.

32:11.729 --> 32:14.220
She loved you, too.

32:14.265 --> 32:16.062
No matter what you said.

32:16.100 --> 32:19.297
No matter what happened
between the two of you,

32:19.337 --> 32:20.634
she loved you.

32:21.973 --> 32:25.909
She loves you.

32:54.639 --> 32:57.540
So you were right.

32:57.575 --> 33:01.511
- Cristina and I are fighting.
- Go, talk to her.

33:03.014 --> 33:06.950
She's your best friend.
It's important.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.483
Derek?

33:12.690 --> 33:16.319
They don't tell you when you become
a doctor it's gonna be like this.

33:18.129 --> 33:20.927
They don't tell you that you...

33:20.965 --> 33:23.593
...lose more patients than you save.

33:24.569 --> 33:26.537
Sixteen.

33:28.239 --> 33:29.900
I'm sick of the death.

33:32.810 --> 33:34.801
I'm sorry.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.011
- I'll see you at home.
- OK.

33:51.729 --> 33:55.221
It's OK. Nobody else is here.
It's just me.

33:55.266 --> 33:57.564
And I'm just an intern. I'm nobody.

33:57.602 --> 34:00.662
So you can try,
and if it doesn't work, it's OK.

34:00.705 --> 34:03.640
Just... just try.

34:11.815 --> 34:13.248
Hi.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.085
Hi.

34:24.695 --> 34:28.630
Hi.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.663
Hi.

34:42.146 --> 34:43.875
Hi.

34:45.817 --> 34:46.943
Hi.

35:00.331 --> 35:01.525
Hi.

35:08.139 --> 35:11.074
Dr. Dixon, how's your day been?

35:11.109 --> 35:13.669
Feel like you may have
a home at Seattle Grace?

35:13.711 --> 35:17.147
Dr. Yang, you tortured her,
making her choose among her peers.

35:17.181 --> 35:21.811
Some kind of emotional torture.
Was that your intention?

35:22.620 --> 35:24.212
Yes.

35:27.792 --> 35:31.057
Have your board make me a better offer.

35:45.042 --> 35:48.273
We're fighting, and I don't want to be.

35:48.312 --> 35:50.280
Let's just put this past us.

35:50.314 --> 35:53.545
What happened with the Chief
and interns, it doesn't matter.

35:53.584 --> 35:56.280
That's why you didn't choose me,
why you made it personal.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.481
So let's just move on.

35:58.523 --> 36:00.616
You made it personal.

36:00.658 --> 36:05.721
This, here, is you making it personal.
You told me to do what I had to do.

36:05.763 --> 36:10.257
So I chose Alex. He's the most prepared.
That's why I didn't choose you.

36:10.301 --> 36:12.166
Not because we're fighting.

36:12.203 --> 36:18.005
Because, unlike you, I can separate
my personal life from my job.

36:18.042 --> 36:19.634
You made it personal.

36:33.591 --> 36:37.789
None of you said anything.
Those were all our interns.

36:38.729 --> 36:40.390
But I won this.

36:40.431 --> 36:42.592
They picked me.

36:42.633 --> 36:46.399
If I don't deserve this solo surgery,
then none of us do.

36:55.046 --> 36:59.745
I don't know if I'm more jealous of Alex
or worried about Izzie.

37:02.386 --> 37:04.946
I think something's wrong with her, Mer.

37:04.989 --> 37:07.958
Something's wrong with all of us,
George.

37:09.927 --> 37:11.690
It's Alex.

37:18.035 --> 37:19.696
Not here.

37:22.006 --> 37:23.098
Here.

37:30.648 --> 37:33.981
- Hi. You paged?
- I need you to scrub in with me.

37:34.018 --> 37:37.044
- Where's Izzie?
- I'm freaking out.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.613
I'm freaking out!
I told her I love her.

37:39.657 --> 37:44.720
I told her I love her before
the solo surgery. I can't believe that.

37:44.762 --> 37:46.957
She's not gonna show,
I'm freaking out.

37:46.998 --> 37:51.697
Stop freaking out. If you screw this up
and kill this guy, I'm gonna be pissed.

37:51.736 --> 37:56.298
Then I'll know I should have won it.
You have to kick ass in there, Alex.

37:56.340 --> 37:58.137
You have no choice.

37:59.543 --> 38:02.011
Big night, Karev. You ready?

38:05.683 --> 38:07.275
You ready?

38:08.419 --> 38:10.216
He's ready.

38:19.697 --> 38:22.791
- Where are we going?
- Don't worry. You'll like it.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.758
Come on.

38:29.407 --> 38:31.773
Wait. Just wait.

38:31.809 --> 38:32.935
Wait.

38:38.115 --> 38:39.173
It's OK.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.488
It's good. Right, right?

38:47.291 --> 38:50.954
It's the vent. It clears your head.
You feel better, right?

38:52.330 --> 38:54.821
Yes, yeah!

38:54.865 --> 38:59.461
It's out of time, out of space.
Anything can happen on the vent.

38:59.503 --> 39:01.232
Anything.

39:01.272 --> 39:03.137
Like what?

39:05.376 --> 39:06.843
Just wait.

39:29.200 --> 39:32.431
You made her speak.
Mrs. Patterson. She said "hi".

39:32.470 --> 39:34.495
She spoke. You made her speak.

39:40.311 --> 39:42.370
I respect you.

39:42.413 --> 39:47.077
As a man, as a surgeon,
as a teacher, I respect you.

39:47.118 --> 39:50.610
So... teach me.

39:52.556 --> 39:54.183
What are you doing?

39:54.225 --> 39:57.319
- Don't do that. Stop.
- Teach me.

40:00.164 --> 40:02.632
- Stop.
- Teach me.

40:02.666 --> 40:06.466
We can't do this. You're Little Grey.
And I promised.

40:06.504 --> 40:10.065
- And I'm your teacher.
- So teach me.

40:10.107 --> 40:11.574
Lexie.

40:12.543 --> 40:14.272
Teach me.

40:17.014 --> 40:18.379
Teach me.

40:23.320 --> 40:27.086
Come on, am I really so bad?

40:29.160 --> 40:31.526
No.

40:31.562 --> 40:32.927
I am.

40:41.972 --> 40:45.305
<i>We enter the world alone,</i>
<i>and we leave it alone.</i>

40:46.977 --> 40:49.309
<i>And everything that happens in between?</i>

40:49.346 --> 40:52.611
<i>We owe it to ourselves</i>
<i>to find a little company.</i>

40:52.650 --> 40:55.050
Fifty says he calls the Chief
in ten minutes.

40:55.085 --> 40:58.282
A hundred he chokes
before they turn on the saw.

40:58.322 --> 41:01.519
That's one of us down there.
Show some respect.

41:01.559 --> 41:05.495
<i>We need help.</i>
<i>We need support.</i>

41:10.334 --> 41:12.802
<i>Otherwise, we're in it by ourselves.</i>

41:15.206 --> 41:16.867
<i>Strangers.</i>

41:20.611 --> 41:22.772
<i>Cut off from each other.</i>

41:22.813 --> 41:24.644
<i>And we forget...</i>

41:27.451 --> 41:30.284
<i>...just how connected we all are.</i>

41:42.099 --> 41:44.499
<i>So instead, we choose love.</i>

41:45.769 --> 41:47.498
<i>We choose life.</i>

41:48.205 --> 41:51.800
<i>And, for a moment, we feel</i>

41:51.842 --> 41:54.811
<i>just a little bit less alone.</i>

41:57.414 --> 41:58.745
Ten-blade.
