[tape recorder starts]

00:12.304 --> 00:13.945
[man] <i>They're comin' to lock your ass up.</i>

00:15.766 --> 00:16.766
Yours and your friend's.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.270
Now, if you want my help...

00:20.354 --> 00:22.856
you have to do as I say,
and things are gonna be done proper.

00:26.401 --> 00:29.238
If you don't want it,
you can tell me right now...

00:31.448 --> 00:34.535
- and you're gonna deny ever knowing me.
- Well, I want your help.

00:36.203 --> 00:40.165
[man] <i>It's gonna save you</i>
<i>and your friend's ass from jail.</i>

00:40.249 --> 00:42.626
<i>- But you're gonna pay me in the end.</i>
- [boy] <i>Yeah.</i>

00:45.212 --> 00:47.839
Fuck, you got yourself
in a pile of shit, man.

00:47.923 --> 00:50.092
How'd you fucking do three people at once?

00:53.095 --> 00:56.306
Tell me what went on, and I'll tell you
how I'll take care of your problem.

01:04.273 --> 01:06.191
[distant gunshot]

01:07.609 --> 01:11.196
[phone dials, rings]

01:11.280 --> 01:15.284
- [man 1] <i>What are you reporting?</i>
- [man 2] <i>Uh, there's, uh...</i>

01:15.367 --> 01:17.786
<i>I need, uh, an ambulance.</i>

01:17.869 --> 01:20.122
[man 1] <i>Okay.</i>
<i>What's the problem there?</i>

01:20.205 --> 01:25.419
[man 2] <i>There's been some kind</i>
<i>of break-in. I...</i> [gasping]

01:25.502 --> 01:28.130
[man 1] <i>Okay, well, just calm down.</i>
<i>What's the problem?</i>

01:28.213 --> 01:31.466
[man 2] <i>The... The two...</i>

01:33.010 --> 01:34.845
<i>My friend, his mom and dad...</i>

01:36.013 --> 01:38.890
<i>are... </i>[stammering]

01:38.974 --> 01:39.974
<i>We think they're dead.</i>

01:42.060 --> 01:45.105
- [man 1] <i>Just calm down.</i>
<i>- </i>[man 2] <i>I don't think it's safe here.</i>

01:45.188 --> 01:48.692
<i>- I want... We'll be outside.</i>
<i>- </i> [man 1] <i>Okay, go ahead and go outside.</i>

01:48.775 --> 01:50.795
- [man 2] <i>Please, fast! Okay?</i>
<i>- </i> [man 1] <i>They're on the way.</i>

01:50.819 --> 01:52.380
- [man 2] <i>Okay.</i>
<i>- </i> [man 1] <i>They're on the way.</i>

01:52.404 --> 01:54.485
- [man 2] <i>We'll be outside.</i>
<i>- </i>[man 1]<i> Okay, go ahead.</i>

01:58.660 --> 02:01.663
[siren wails]

02:02.247 --> 02:05.834
[man] <i>Approximately 2:30 in the morning,</i>
<i>I got a phone call.</i>

02:05.917 --> 02:08.962
My boss asked me to respond
to the Rafay residence,

02:09.046 --> 02:10.756
which was in the Somerset area
of Bellevue.

02:13.133 --> 02:16.053
They had just moved in,
so there was a lot of boxes.

02:17.054 --> 02:22.893
<i>In the family room downstairs, we found
Mrs. Rafay facedown on the ground.</i>

02:22.976 --> 02:25.187
<i>She had blunt force trauma to the head.</i>

02:29.691 --> 02:33.195
<i>From that room,
we went upstairs to Dr. Rafay's room.</i>

02:34.988 --> 02:37.949
<i>There was blood spatter, brain matter...</i>

02:40.077 --> 02:45.582
The entire room was covered in debris
from the murder of Dr. Rafay.

02:49.753 --> 02:54.549
<i>And then we went into Basma Rafay's room,
the daughter of Dr. Rafay.</i>

02:56.093 --> 02:57.219
<i>She was still alive.</i>

02:58.387 --> 03:00.597
<i>And she later died
at the hospital that morning.</i>

03:02.307 --> 03:06.019
<i>The two people that found them
were Atif Rafay, the son,</i>

03:06.103 --> 03:09.231
<i>and his best friend, Sebastian Burns.</i>

03:09.314 --> 03:11.608
<i>They were our only witnesses.</i>

03:11.691 --> 03:13.652
<i>When they took them down
to the police department,</i>

03:13.735 --> 03:15.028
<i>that was the first time</i>

03:15.112 --> 03:18.824
that it was kind of an eye-opener
as to who these people really were.

03:36.007 --> 03:40.011
At the time, we didn't understand
how the world worked.

03:40.095 --> 03:41.847
I don't know how to describe it.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.559
But when you're a teenager,
anything seems possible.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.771
[Isaacs] <i>We started dating in grade 12</i>

03:49.855 --> 03:55.569
and dated throughout
first year of college.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.946
<i>Sebastian, he was bright.</i>

03:58.029 --> 04:01.116
<i>He was a good student
but a lazy student.</i>

04:01.199 --> 04:02.993
He was someone who liked to talk

04:03.076 --> 04:06.204
and debate and share
and tell you how he felt.

04:07.289 --> 04:10.292
<i>And then Atif, he was such an achiever.</i>

04:11.835 --> 04:16.047
<i>His parents were highly educated.
She had a master's degree.</i>

04:16.131 --> 04:19.801
<i>And Dr. Rafay
had his doctorate in engineering.</i>

04:19.885 --> 04:22.721
So both of Atif's parents
were very accomplished.

04:23.805 --> 04:28.393
<i>I think that they're the reason
that he went to a school like Cornell.</i>

04:28.477 --> 04:32.522
That's what was expected of him,
and he was happy to fulfill that role.

04:33.774 --> 04:40.530
<i>Atif's sister had been disabled
by a childhood bout of spinal meningitis.</i>

04:40.614 --> 04:43.909
<i>And so, Atif's mother
really looked after her.</i>

04:45.702 --> 04:48.580
<i>Sebastian and Atif were very good friends.</i>

04:48.663 --> 04:53.126
And they were guys that didn't look like
they would be friends with each other.

04:53.210 --> 04:56.755
These guys are culturally different.
They're an odd pair.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.931
[Isaacs] <i>The Rafay family</i>
<i>lived in North Vancouver.</i>

05:06.014 --> 05:07.808
<i>So they had just moved to Bellevue.</i>

05:09.309 --> 05:13.104
<i>And Sebastian had been living
in Vancouver.</i>

05:13.188 --> 05:15.315
<i>And he actually visited Atif.</i>

05:16.316 --> 05:18.819
Atif had been attending
Cornell University.

05:18.902 --> 05:22.614
<i>It was his mom who actually had been
calling saying, "Come down and visit."</i>

05:22.697 --> 05:24.866
<i>So they had been in the house
for five days.</i>

05:24.950 --> 05:29.079
And then this one night that they actually
went out, then this tragedy happens.

05:31.456 --> 05:34.751
<i>So we took an entire statement
from Burns and Rafay.</i>

05:36.086 --> 05:39.589
In checking those alibis,
everybody remembered them.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.926
<i>They left their home
about 8:30 in the evening.</i>

05:43.009 --> 05:46.513
<i>They went down to a Keg restaurant,
and after they went there,</i>

05:46.596 --> 05:50.183
<i>they went across the street</i>
<i>to </i>The Lion King,<i> to watch a movie.</i>

05:50.267 --> 05:51.911
[Thompson] <i>Loren, you're employed</i>
<i>by the Factoria Cinemas.</i>

05:51.935 --> 05:53.256
<i>- Is that correct?</i>
<i>- </i>[Loren] <i>Yeah.</i>

05:56.690 --> 05:59.067
[Thompson] <i>And one of those persons</i>
<i>you said you recognized?</i>

05:59.150 --> 06:03.446
[Loren] <i>I'm almost positive that I saw him</i>
<i>'cause he was wearing an army jacket.</i>

06:06.741 --> 06:08.382
[Thompson] <i>How certain are you</i>
<i>of the guy?</i>

06:08.410 --> 06:10.245
[Loren] <i>I'm positive I saw him.</i>

06:10.328 --> 06:14.332
After they went to <i>The Lion King,</i>
they said they went over to Seattle.

06:14.416 --> 06:17.502
<i>Drove over there to an all-night diner.</i>

06:17.586 --> 06:19.963
[Thompson] <i>And you recall</i>
<i>seeing these guys before?</i>

06:20.046 --> 06:22.215
[woman] <i>Yeah, they asked</i>
<i>about the clubs in the area,</i>

06:22.299 --> 06:24.676
<i>and one wanted to know
what time it closed.</i>

06:24.759 --> 06:27.387
[Thompson] <i>And after they left there,</i>
<i>they went to find a club.</i>

06:27.470 --> 06:30.390
<i>And after they left the club,
they then came home.</i>

06:32.475 --> 06:35.687
People act differently
when they've seen trauma.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.689
But they acted very strange.

06:38.815 --> 06:45.405
<i>Atif Rafay, he was just very nonchalant
about what had happened.</i>

06:45.488 --> 06:47.657
<i>He had saw his mom, she was dead.</i>

06:47.741 --> 06:51.661
<i>He ran upstairs, found his dad.
There wasn't anything he could do.</i>

06:51.745 --> 06:54.623
<i>He heard his sister
in the room next door to his dad.</i>

06:54.706 --> 06:58.084
I said, "Well, did you check on her?"
And he says, "No, I didn't check on her."

06:58.168 --> 07:00.396
"Why wouldn't you check on her
if you knew she was alive?"

07:00.420 --> 07:03.632
<i>And he said, "Well, I...
There was nothing I could do."</i>

07:03.715 --> 07:07.344
In fact, I think he even said,
"I can't even put on a Band-Aid, okay?

07:08.511 --> 07:11.139
<i>All I know is somebody had taken
my Walkman,"</i>

07:11.222 --> 07:13.058
<i>from a shelf in his room.</i>

07:13.141 --> 07:16.478
<i>And a VCR was missing
from the family room.</i>

07:16.561 --> 07:19.522
You just saw your dad slaughtered.
You just saw your mom slaughtered.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.567
And you're telling me
that someone stole your Walkman?

07:22.651 --> 07:28.156
<i>And Sebastian Burns, he was very put out
about even having to talk to police.</i>

07:28.239 --> 07:30.408
<i>He was feeling that,
"I already talked to the police.</i>

07:30.492 --> 07:31.952
<i>I already told them what happened."</i>

07:32.035 --> 07:34.537
<i>It became clear.
It's like, "He's been up all night.</i>

07:34.621 --> 07:38.333
<i>He's probably tired.
He just saw a horrific murder scene.</i>

07:38.416 --> 07:40.961
<i>What we need to do is wrap this up."</i>

07:41.044 --> 07:42.754
<i>So we put them up in a hotel,</i>

07:42.837 --> 07:45.882
<i>gave them our pager numbers
and our contact numbers,</i>

07:45.966 --> 07:48.760
and said, "We'll be in touch with you.
Let's get some sleep."

07:52.055 --> 07:54.325
[Isaacs] <i>I didn't know exactly</i>
<i>when they were gonna come home.</i>

07:54.349 --> 07:59.062
Their plans were a little loose.
So I had been phoning the Burns house.

07:59.145 --> 08:02.440
And... one morning, um,

08:02.524 --> 08:04.859
my parents woke me up.

08:06.945 --> 08:09.572
<i>They told me that they had read
in the newspaper</i>

08:09.656 --> 08:12.867
<i>that Atif's family had been murdered.</i>

08:12.951 --> 08:17.205
And it occurred to me
that the Burns may not know.

08:17.288 --> 08:20.500
<i>So I phoned Mr. Burns.</i>

08:21.501 --> 08:24.045
And he answered the phone,
and he sort of joked

08:24.129 --> 08:26.172
and said, "Sebastian isn't home yet."

08:26.256 --> 08:29.300
And I said...
I was sort of sobbing into the phone,

08:29.384 --> 08:30.760
and I said, "You haven't heard."

08:36.349 --> 08:41.438
Sebastian finally called us around...
It was after nine o'clock in the evening.

08:41.521 --> 08:45.525
And I said,
"Hi. Are you...? What's your status?

08:45.608 --> 08:48.111
Like, are you in custody
or anything of that nature?"

08:48.194 --> 08:49.904
And he said, "No, we're in a motel."

08:53.408 --> 08:55.618
So I said, "Well, I, you know...

08:56.619 --> 08:59.873
I think I'd like to come down
and pick you guys up and bring you

08:59.956 --> 09:02.125
'cause I guess you can't go back
to the house.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.210
So you've got no place to stay."

09:04.294 --> 09:07.714
<i>And he said, "No, we can't leave
without letting the police know."</i>

09:07.797 --> 09:11.134
As soon as the murders happened,
they were taken in

09:11.217 --> 09:14.596
by the Bellevue Police Department
and sequestered.

09:15.597 --> 09:20.518
[Isaacs] <i>They were in a dingy motel room</i>
<i>for three days</i>

09:20.602 --> 09:25.815
<i>and just questioned at the Bellevue
police's discretion for that time period.</i>

09:27.275 --> 09:28.627
Initially, when you're taking
these statements,

09:28.651 --> 09:30.653
you're just kinda, like,
getting this information.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.573
But, as you're kinda sitting back
and looking at it again,

09:33.656 --> 09:35.617
you go, "I wanna take
another look at this.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.061
Something isn't making any sense."

09:40.080 --> 09:43.458
[Thompson] <i>Sebastian Burns</i>
<i>makes the 911 call.</i>

09:43.541 --> 09:45.186
[Burns] <i>There's been</i>
<i>some kind of break-in!</i>

09:45.210 --> 09:47.480
<i>Those words weren't very significant
to me in the beginning.</i>

09:47.504 --> 09:52.509
A break-in... refers to a burglary
of some sort, not a murder.

09:53.510 --> 09:57.889
<i>And when you look at this home,
it was a staged burglary.</i>

09:57.972 --> 10:02.769
<i>In a room that Sebastian Burns
was staying in, there were legal boxes.</i>

10:02.852 --> 10:05.647
<i>So when you first walk in,
it looks like somebody had been rummaging</i>

10:05.730 --> 10:07.148
<i>through documents and things.</i>

10:07.232 --> 10:10.693
But if you really look closely at it,
the boxes hadn't been gone through at all.

10:10.777 --> 10:11.977
They'd just been knocked over.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.867
<i>And then you take the alibi,
The Keg restaurant.</i>

10:17.951 --> 10:19.661
<i>And the waiter there goes, "Oh, yeah.</i>

10:19.744 --> 10:23.832
Definitely remember them because
they ordered a salad and some wine."

10:23.915 --> 10:27.127
<i>I think they were ordering wine
so that the guy would ask for ID</i>

10:27.210 --> 10:29.671
<i>and remember that there was two Canadians
that came in here</i>

10:29.754 --> 10:32.465
and ordered wine with a salad.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.677
<i>At the all-night diner in Seattle,
they remembered them there</i>

10:35.760 --> 10:39.556
<i>because the waitress said that they
ordered just a Coke and some fries.</i>

10:39.639 --> 10:41.349
<i>"And they left me a ten-dollar tip."</i>

10:42.433 --> 10:44.703
<i>And when they went to The Weathered Wall,
which was a nightclub,</i>

10:44.727 --> 10:48.982
<i>that guy remembered them because he said,
"I looked at my watch, 20 minutes to 2:00.</i>

10:49.065 --> 10:51.627
<i>We were just getting ready to close."
He said, "I wouldn't let 'em in."</i>

10:51.651 --> 10:53.671
It's all these little pieces
that you start putting...

10:53.695 --> 10:56.781
Individually, they're not too meaningful.

10:56.865 --> 11:01.786
But you start putting them all together
and you have a very organized plan

11:01.870 --> 11:04.497
on how they were going to commit a murder.

11:11.921 --> 11:15.925
[Thompson] <i>The next day, we went</i>
<i>to locate them, went to the hotel,</i>

11:16.009 --> 11:17.969
and they were just gone.

11:23.558 --> 11:27.854
Carol had the moxie to phone
the Canadian consulate

11:27.937 --> 11:33.234
<i>to make sure that the Bellevue police
had, indeed, been consulted</i>

11:33.318 --> 11:36.779
about this move back to Vancouver.

11:36.863 --> 11:37.864
And they had.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.868
[Isaacs] <i>Once they got home,</i>

11:41.951 --> 11:45.121
the Bellevue police leaked...

11:45.204 --> 11:46.205
not leaked...

11:47.290 --> 11:51.419
told the press
that Sebastian and Atif had fled,

11:51.502 --> 11:57.300
<i>which was the first of many
dirty tactics that sent the signal</i>

11:57.383 --> 11:59.469
<i>that this was not gonna go well.</i>

11:59.552 --> 12:02.597
So we reported in the media...
No, we didn't report in the media.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.350
So...

12:08.102 --> 12:11.814
It was reported in the media
that Burns and Rafay had fled to Canada.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.318
<i>And, for all I knew, they were fleeing,</i>

12:15.401 --> 12:19.072
<i>they were getting away from Bellevue,
basically, as fast as they can.</i>

12:19.155 --> 12:20.782
But, to be frank with you...

12:22.075 --> 12:24.619
at the time, we didn't have any reason
not to let 'em go to...

12:24.702 --> 12:27.413
I mean, we... They were free to go
wherever they wanted.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.123
<i>But they were just gone.</i>

12:30.124 --> 12:32.585
[Dave] <i>They got back here</i>
<i>around five o'clock.</i>

12:32.669 --> 12:36.589
We had the television news on
from Seattle at that time

12:36.673 --> 12:39.300
because I'd been trying to follow
what had been going on.

12:40.635 --> 12:41.635
And...

12:42.762 --> 12:46.265
blow me down,
it was coverage of the funeral.

12:53.356 --> 12:56.818
[newscaster] <i>Members of the Rafay family</i>
<i>gathered at the Northgate Mosque today.</i>

12:56.901 --> 13:01.072
<i>Rafay's 18-year-old son,
who found the bodies, was not there</i>

13:01.155 --> 13:03.700
<i>and has declined to speak.</i>

13:03.783 --> 13:07.954
<i>Atif was just... I'd never seen him
with that much of an emotional outburst.</i>

13:08.037 --> 13:10.206
He just said, "Those bastards!"

13:10.289 --> 13:14.836
Clearly upset that he hadn't participated
in the ceremony

13:14.919 --> 13:17.964
for the interment of his entire family.

13:19.382 --> 13:21.718
And the cops had just not told him.

13:21.801 --> 13:25.888
[woman] Can I just interrupt?
He flew at the TV, screaming,

13:25.972 --> 13:30.435
when he found out his father
and mother and sister had been buried

13:30.518 --> 13:32.895
without him even knowing
there was a funeral.

13:41.946 --> 13:45.783
[man] <i>Everybody who's remotely familiar</i>
<i>with the Muslim faith knows</i>

13:45.867 --> 13:49.412
you must bury the dead in three days.

13:49.495 --> 13:53.291
And the family members are responsible
for washing the bodies

13:53.374 --> 13:55.126
and preparing them for burial.

13:55.209 --> 13:58.254
The notion that Atif Rafay
didn't have any idea about that

13:58.337 --> 14:02.258
is the craziest bunch of bullshit
I've ever heard in my life.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.932
That's just one funeral, by the way.

14:10.016 --> 14:13.436
There was also a memorial service
in British Columbia some months later.

14:15.688 --> 14:20.151
<i>And Sebastian Burns and Atif Rafay
went to the building.</i>

14:20.234 --> 14:23.780
<i>As they walked up the door,
a news reporter asked them the question:</i>

14:23.863 --> 14:26.657
[woman] Atif, why won't you
talk to the police?

14:29.535 --> 14:32.413
Atif, why won't you talk to the police?

14:32.497 --> 14:36.542
[Konat] <i>And with that question,</i>
<i>they turned around, laughing,</i>

14:36.626 --> 14:39.003
<i>ran back to the parking lot...</i>

14:40.213 --> 14:41.422
<i>get into a car.</i>

14:42.924 --> 14:43.925
<i>And they drove away.</i>

14:45.468 --> 14:48.262
Seeing that kind of thing,
right away, you think,

14:48.346 --> 14:50.473
"Oh, these guys,
they must be murderers.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.351
They don't care about the killing."

14:54.519 --> 14:58.523
<i>When, in fact, that's an example
of the way kids behave</i>

14:58.606 --> 15:00.942
after terrible, shocking events.

15:03.778 --> 15:08.366
You could see there was stuff going on
that was completely inappropriate.

15:10.201 --> 15:13.079
<i>But if you're gonna be a serious killer,</i>

15:13.162 --> 15:16.416
the first thing you're gonna do
is stand by the grave and cry.

15:16.499 --> 15:18.501
<i>When I see the way they were behaving,</i>

15:18.584 --> 15:22.130
<i>I think these guys,
A, were a couple of goofballs.</i>

15:22.213 --> 15:25.716
But, B, they were in shock
at what had happened.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.638
<i>And there's no standard of behavior
after something like that.</i>

15:37.395 --> 15:40.398
[man] <i>Why would Atif Rafay come home</i>
<i>and murder his entire family?</i>

15:40.481 --> 15:44.318
That, on the face of it,
seemed very odd and unusual

15:44.402 --> 15:45.820
and compelling, as a journalist.

15:49.824 --> 15:52.452
Ninety-eight percent
of the reporters and the coverage

15:52.535 --> 15:56.164
<i>was very, very skeptical
of their innocence.</i>

15:56.247 --> 15:58.833
<i>And that was all of these doubts
and information</i>

15:58.916 --> 16:01.544
that was sort of seeded by police.

16:01.627 --> 16:05.006
They were absolutely demonized
in the press.

16:06.674 --> 16:10.386
[Isaacs] <i>They became</i>
<i>just criminal mastermind archetypes.</i>

16:10.470 --> 16:14.223
They weren't the stupid kids
that we knew them to be.

16:14.307 --> 16:19.395
They were... They were
evil geniuses in the press.

16:19.479 --> 16:23.608
And it inspired a lot of hatred
in the public.

16:25.610 --> 16:28.088
[Thompson] <i>When we were trying to learn</i>
<i>about who Burns and Rafay are,</i>

16:28.112 --> 16:32.074
<i>we saw in his high school yearbook,</i>
<i>he was in a play called </i>The Rope

16:32.158 --> 16:34.869
about two college kids
who commit the perfect murder.

16:35.536 --> 16:38.122
I mean, that does grab your attention.

16:38.206 --> 16:42.043
<i>And so, I went out and rented the movie.</i>

16:42.126 --> 16:44.212
<i>And I... To me, I was shocked</i>

16:44.295 --> 16:49.759
<i>at even how closely they physically
resembled Burns and Rafay in the movie.</i>

16:49.842 --> 16:54.972
<i>And the fact that they were involved
in Nietzsche and philosophies.</i>

16:56.557 --> 16:58.351
[woman] <i>These were very well-read boys.</i>

16:58.434 --> 17:01.896
Atif sent me many essays
that he has written.

17:01.979 --> 17:06.567
So I was very impressed
by his writing style, especially,

17:06.651 --> 17:08.611
and his literary mind.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.450
I developed a crush on him, I would say.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.578
And then, over time,
we have become a couple.

17:20.706 --> 17:23.376
<i>The aspects of Nietzsche
that were appealing to them</i>

17:23.459 --> 17:27.088
were just things about freedom of spirit
and freedom of thought

17:27.171 --> 17:30.716
and very beautiful philosophies
that I think a lot of people love

17:30.800 --> 17:32.843
if they actually take the time to read it.

17:32.927 --> 17:38.391
As I understood, Nietzsche believed in...
that there was a superman theory...

17:38.474 --> 17:42.979
<i>where there were people
who were elevated above others.</i>

17:43.062 --> 17:46.399
<i>And they were superior beings to others.</i>

17:46.482 --> 17:51.571
And, from what I know
of Sebastian Burns and Atif Rafay...

17:51.654 --> 17:54.782
I think they fit into that,
and I think they believed that.

17:55.741 --> 18:00.162
[Klonsky] <i>They had characters</i>
<i>that people were put off by.</i>

18:00.246 --> 18:03.874
The Bellevue police didn't want
these two guys to get the better of them.

18:03.958 --> 18:09.005
The motive, of course, the police said,
was money and life insurance.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.257
[Thompson] <i>As I recall there were</i>
<i>three policies.</i>

18:11.340 --> 18:13.926
<i>Now, the American policy
paid off right away.</i>

18:14.010 --> 18:16.596
And we called and said,
"Hey, they're suspects in a murder case."

18:16.679 --> 18:20.141
They go, "Have they been charged?"
"No." "Then we're paying."

18:23.352 --> 18:26.731
And, sure enough, they did seem to go
on a bit of a spending spree, those two.

18:28.941 --> 18:32.862
<i>They purchased a Mustang convertible
and went on sort of a road trip.</i>

18:34.322 --> 18:38.993
Again, not exactly what you might expect,
but they chose to do it.

18:40.786 --> 18:44.457
[Konat] <i>The RCMP,</i>
<i>or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,</i>

18:44.540 --> 18:47.293
<i>they are the equivalent of the FBI.</i>

18:47.376 --> 18:50.546
At some point, they learned
that in the United States,

18:50.630 --> 18:51.964
three murders had been committed

18:52.048 --> 18:54.842
<i>presumably by two Canadian citizens,</i>

18:54.925 --> 18:56.344
<i>and a determination was made</i>

18:56.427 --> 18:59.263
that they should open
their own investigation.

18:59.347 --> 19:03.100
<i>Burns and Rafay were living with
their high school friend, Jimmy Miyoshi,</i>

19:03.184 --> 19:06.187
<i>blaring their music
and staying up all night.</i>

19:06.270 --> 19:08.522
<i>The RCMP had put wires in the house</i>

19:08.606 --> 19:11.150
<i>so that they could listen
to their conversations.</i>

19:11.233 --> 19:13.486
It didn't take long for them to figure out

19:13.569 --> 19:17.990
<i>that the suspects, the targets
in their investigation, were bright kids.</i>

19:18.074 --> 19:19.754
<i>And that led them to come
to the conclusion</i>

19:19.825 --> 19:23.162
that traditional police methods
were not going to work with these two.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.045
[Hutchinson] <i>The Royal Canadian</i>
<i>Mounted Police</i>

19:31.128 --> 19:34.090
<i>developed an undercover
investigative technique</i>

19:34.173 --> 19:36.300
<i>called "The Mr. Big Technique,"</i>

19:36.384 --> 19:40.513
<i>that they deploy or they use,
normally, in cold murder cases.</i>

19:40.596 --> 19:42.181
But they have a suspect.

19:42.264 --> 19:45.184
They just don't have enough evidence
to lay charge.

19:47.269 --> 19:51.440
[Hutchinson] <i>What they'll do is,</i>
<i>the police officers disguise themselves</i>

19:51.524 --> 19:53.651
<i>as underworld figures.</i>

19:53.734 --> 19:56.529
<i>Eventually, the target becomes aware
that he's dealing</i>

19:56.612 --> 19:59.407
with what he thinks are criminals.

19:59.490 --> 20:02.034
<i>They'll get to a point where they'll say,</i>

20:02.118 --> 20:06.163
"Gee, we overheard somewhere
that you're suspected of a murder."

20:06.247 --> 20:11.001
<i>And they'll tell their target
that he's got a meeting with Mr. Big.</i>

20:11.085 --> 20:15.673
<i>And Mr. Big is the head
of the criminal organization.</i>

20:15.756 --> 20:18.509
<i>And the crime boss
starts telling them things like,</i>

20:18.592 --> 20:20.302
"We know that you committed a murder.

20:20.386 --> 20:24.098
And now you've put our whole organization
in jeopardy by associating with us.

20:24.181 --> 20:26.976
So just tell us what happened.
Tell us what happened."

20:28.060 --> 20:33.858
<i>These undercover sting operations
take months to unfold.</i>

20:33.941 --> 20:35.776
And they've got one mission.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.362
And that mission
is to extract a confession.

20:38.446 --> 20:42.700
Once I became familiar with the operation
that was conducted in this case,

20:42.783 --> 20:45.161
<i>it was then that I got
to know Gary and Al.</i>

20:47.371 --> 20:50.875
They are extraordinarily talented.
They are very dedicated.

20:50.958 --> 20:56.630
And they make a very complicated job
look extremely easy.

20:56.714 --> 20:59.651
[Konat] <i>Once the wire is in the house,</i>
<i>there are people who are listening to it.</i>

20:59.675 --> 21:01.260
<i>And they just heard them say...</i>

21:01.343 --> 21:04.930
<i>"Burns is getting his hair cut at Crimpers
at four o'clock on Tuesday."</i>

21:05.014 --> 21:08.184
So they have people in place
to follow him when he leaves.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.894
They see where he parks his car.

21:09.977 --> 21:13.606
That allows the undercover operators
to position their vehicle next to him.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.358
And so that when he comes out,
just, out of the blue,

21:16.442 --> 21:20.237
he walks up and there is the undercover
operator, Gary, waiting for him.

21:21.322 --> 21:24.200
<i>Gary told Burns that he had locked
his keys in his car</i>

21:24.283 --> 21:26.285
and asked if he could help him out.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.953
<i>"Would you mind giving me a ride?"</i>

21:28.037 --> 21:30.831
<i>He'll give him $100 for his time.
Burns says, "No problem."</i>

21:30.915 --> 21:34.835
<i>And Gary convinces Sebastian
to go down to the bar and have a drink.</i>

21:34.919 --> 21:36.119
And they start a conversation.

21:37.171 --> 21:39.191
[Gary] <i>If there's fuckin'...</i>
<i>If there's money to be made...</i>

21:39.215 --> 21:41.300
- [Burns] <i>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.</i>
- [Gary] <i>You know?</i>

21:41.383 --> 21:43.803
<i>I'd fuckin' much easier make...</i>

21:43.886 --> 21:46.972
<i>- five bucks doin' this than doin' that.
- Yeah.</i>

21:47.056 --> 21:49.075
[Gary] <i>But the thing is,</i>
<i>you make a dollar doin' this.</i>

21:49.099 --> 21:51.310
<i>- You make a hundred dollars doin' that.
- Yeah.</i>

21:51.393 --> 21:52.913
<i>You gotta fuckin' weigh your options,
you know?</i>

21:52.937 --> 21:53.771
[Burns] <i>Well...</i>

21:53.854 --> 21:57.024
[Gary] <i>You're a fuckin' young,</i>
<i>unemployed kid.</i>

21:57.107 --> 22:02.780
<i>You're gonna now fuckin' do
some big-time opportunities</i>

22:02.863 --> 22:04.740
<i>without knowing
you're capable of doing them.</i>

22:04.824 --> 22:06.408
[Burns] <i>Yeah, I understand.</i>

22:07.576 --> 22:09.078
[Konat] <i>For the next four months,</i>

22:09.161 --> 22:14.416
<i>Gary and Al introduced different scenarios
that allowed Burns to believe</i>

22:14.500 --> 22:17.753
<i>that these two were involved
in a criminal enterprise.</i>

22:17.837 --> 22:21.882
And all of that was done to dissuade them
of any notion that they might have

22:21.966 --> 22:24.718
that Gary and Al were cops.

22:24.802 --> 22:26.387
[Gary] <i>What do you think we're into?</i>

22:26.470 --> 22:31.183
[Burns] <i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I guess cars, guns, drugs, heists.</i>

22:31.267 --> 22:33.978
<i>I don't know.
How many crimes can I think of?</i>

22:34.061 --> 22:36.230
[Gary] <i>No, you're looking</i>
<i>at it wrong right there.</i>

22:36.313 --> 22:38.274
<i>You're looking at it as crimes.
It's not crimes.</i>

22:38.357 --> 22:39.775
<i>They're fucking opportunities.</i>

22:39.858 --> 22:44.947
And, on a couple of those scenarios,
Miyoshi was along with Burns.

22:45.030 --> 22:48.242
<i>For example,
they brought a bag full of cash down.</i>

22:48.325 --> 22:51.829
<i>They had Jimmy Miyoshi and Burns
counting the money,</i>

22:51.912 --> 22:54.957
<i>making sure they put it in piles
of less than $10,000.</i>

22:56.792 --> 22:59.753
<i>Another scenario had
an undercover operator come in</i>

22:59.837 --> 23:01.630
<i>and throw two guns on the counter.</i>

23:01.714 --> 23:03.007
He says, "Don't touch those.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.426
They're a little 'warm, '
if you know what I mean."

23:05.509 --> 23:09.763
[man] <i>If he's gonna use it, tell him to</i>
<i>throw it into the salt right away,</i>

23:09.847 --> 23:12.391
<i>'cause she's pretty hot, like she's...</i>

23:12.474 --> 23:16.562
<i>I don't mean hot stolen, I mean...
still warm. You know what I'm sayin'?</i>

23:18.439 --> 23:22.610
So, one of the occasions,
Gary took Burns to a situation

23:22.693 --> 23:26.155
where he went inside and, you know,

23:26.238 --> 23:30.034
allowed Burns to believe that he had beat
the hell outta some guy who was inside,

23:30.117 --> 23:32.036
scuffed his knuckles up on the carpet.

23:33.495 --> 23:37.291
<i>They were allowed to believe
that violence could be used,</i>

23:37.374 --> 23:39.835
<i>if necessary, to conduct their business.</i>

23:39.918 --> 23:43.380
They were allowed to believe that if they
had to kill somebody, they would.

23:43.464 --> 23:44.816
[Gary] <i>I'll tell ya somethin' else.</i>

23:44.840 --> 23:48.010
<i>You wanted to know
what I fuckin' did my time for?</i>

23:48.093 --> 23:52.097
<i>I fuckin' toasted a guy.
You know how I... fuckin' how solid Al is?</i>

23:52.181 --> 23:55.809
<i>When it came time for fuckin' court,
the person that could finger me?</i>

23:55.893 --> 23:57.436
<i>They're not around anymore.</i>

23:57.519 --> 24:02.691
Sebastian didn't have the same kind
of knowledge or savoir faire

24:02.775 --> 24:04.109
that Atif did.

24:04.193 --> 24:09.323
And he can't see
other people being deceptive.

24:09.406 --> 24:13.243
He was not able to gauge
the situation very well.

24:13.327 --> 24:17.623
And... the RCMP understood
who the better target was.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.918
[Gary] <i>I've read about you lots</i>
<i>in the last fuckin' week.</i>

24:21.001 --> 24:23.545
<i>Because I made a point
to find out about you.</i>

24:23.629 --> 24:25.629
<i>You know something?
That's why you're here tonight.</i>

24:26.590 --> 24:29.176
<i>So, what I've read about you
says you're a fuckin' smart man.</i>

24:30.302 --> 24:32.388
- [Burns] <i>Yup.</i>
<i>- </i>[Gary] <i>That's what I want.</i>

24:33.472 --> 24:35.849
Sebastian was seen as a killer.

24:35.933 --> 24:40.270
And other people actually suspected
up here that he was.

24:40.354 --> 24:42.564
And he didn't have much of a life.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.775
<i>He couldn't get a job
or anything like that.</i>

24:44.858 --> 24:47.236
<i>So when he's approached
by these mobsters that said,</i>

24:47.319 --> 24:52.491
"We'll be able to help you out.
You can become part of this gang,"

24:52.574 --> 24:54.451
it's attractive to him.

24:54.535 --> 24:56.704
[Gary] <i>You're either gonna</i>
<i>fuckin' work for me...</i>

24:56.787 --> 24:59.373
<i>and fuckin' get involved makin' money...</i>

24:59.456 --> 25:02.459
<i>and it'll be total fuckin' trust...</i>

25:02.543 --> 25:04.878
<i>where you don't fuck me
and I don't fuck you.</i>

25:04.962 --> 25:06.505
At some point, they said to him,

25:06.588 --> 25:11.677
"You... are gonna have to tell us
about what you did down in Washington."

25:11.760 --> 25:13.641
[Gary] <i>What's your role</i>
<i>in that triple homicide?</i>

25:14.680 --> 25:17.099
[Burns] <i>They think that</i>
<i>I am the murderer.</i>

25:19.017 --> 25:20.602
[Gary] <i>Why?</i>

25:20.686 --> 25:22.414
[Burns] <i>Because they didn't have</i>
<i>anyone else.</i>

25:22.438 --> 25:24.148
<i>- Because, uh...</i>
<i>- </i>[Gary]<i> What's that?</i>

25:25.149 --> 25:27.735
[Burns] <i>Because we were at the house</i>
<i>for a few days,</i>

25:27.818 --> 25:30.237
<i>and they don't have any other leads.</i>

25:30.320 --> 25:34.742
<i>And it's not...
I'm not worried about it because...</i>

25:34.825 --> 25:38.245
<i>forensically or whatever,
they don't have a particular big case.</i>

25:38.328 --> 25:41.415
<i>But... they made it into a big deal.</i>

25:41.498 --> 25:44.251
Sebastian denied many, many times

25:44.334 --> 25:47.921
that he had anything to do
with the killing of the Rafays.

25:48.005 --> 25:52.259
<i>But they were gangsters.
And he wanted to impress them.</i>

25:52.342 --> 25:55.137
[Gary] <i>Okay, stop</i>
<i>the fuckin' bullshit there.</i>

25:55.220 --> 25:57.097
<i>Stop the bullshit there.</i>

25:57.181 --> 25:59.349
<i>Right now, you're out-and-out
fucking lying to me.</i>

25:59.433 --> 26:01.852
[Burns] <i>I'm not goddamn lying to you.</i>

26:01.935 --> 26:04.188
[Gary] <i>The fuckin' report</i>
<i>I fuckin' read...</i>

26:04.271 --> 26:06.315
<i>fuckin' basically spells out
black-and-white...</i>

26:07.775 --> 26:11.278
<i>that the police fuckin' know
you killed these people.</i>

26:12.529 --> 26:14.239
<i>So I'm not putting up with this bullshit.</i>

26:14.323 --> 26:16.700
<i>You're lying to me now or fucking, uh...</i>

26:16.784 --> 26:18.303
<i>you come back
and found these fuckin' bodies.</i>

26:18.327 --> 26:20.180
<i>You must think I come down
with last night's rain.</i>

26:20.204 --> 26:22.039
<i>Maybe you start thinkin' that
about me...</i>

26:22.122 --> 26:22.956
<i>And this fucking...</i>

26:23.040 --> 26:26.752
[Burns] <i>You're misunderstanding me, okay?</i>
<i>You're misunderstanding. All right?</i>

26:26.835 --> 26:28.996
[Gary] <i>Then make it clear</i>
<i>so I won't misunderstand you.</i>

26:29.880 --> 26:33.342
<i>Because... I'm not having fuckin'
my ass get bit here.</i>

26:34.635 --> 26:39.473
The other evidence that was flowing in,
at the very time,

26:39.556 --> 26:43.644
not just, "Oh, there's these two
strange kids sitting in front of me.

26:43.727 --> 26:44.978
They must've done it,"

26:45.062 --> 26:47.648
real, solid evidence was coming in.

26:59.034 --> 27:02.871
[Hutchinson] There was a suggestion
that Atif Rafay's family

27:02.955 --> 27:07.209
was murdered
by a fundamentalist Islamic person,

27:07.292 --> 27:14.007
who took offense to Mr. Rafay's
more moderate stance on Islam.

27:14.091 --> 27:17.594
<i>Atif's father had given lectures
and speeches and...</i>

27:17.678 --> 27:21.515
<i>about Islam in the Western context.</i>

27:21.598 --> 27:26.854
And, apparently, that had offended
some people who were,

27:26.937 --> 27:29.356
<i>you know,
more conservative Muslims.</i>

27:29.439 --> 27:34.611
<i>And the police did have some information
pointing them in that direction.</i>

27:34.695 --> 27:40.993
As an engineer,
he discovered a miscalculation.

27:41.076 --> 27:43.787
[Konat] <i>Tariq Rafay had a theory</i>
<i>about True East</i>

27:43.871 --> 27:46.164
<i>being a degree or two different</i>

27:46.248 --> 27:47.666
than what Muslims in this country,

27:47.749 --> 27:50.711
and perhaps all over the world,
were... were practicing.

27:50.794 --> 27:54.882
<i>But Tariq was suggesting
they should move their prayer mats,</i>

27:54.965 --> 27:59.052
the one or one-and-a-half degree,
when they say their prayers.

28:00.178 --> 28:06.268
He discovered that the mosques
in Canada were not facing Mecca.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.272
<i>In the eyes of a fundamentalist, perhaps,</i>

28:10.355 --> 28:12.774
that would have been upsetting
the apple cart.

28:18.238 --> 28:21.199
[Isaacs] <i>There were</i>
<i>three categories of tips</i>

28:21.283 --> 28:25.913
that came in to the Bellevue police
shortly after the murder.

28:25.996 --> 28:31.084
<i>These were leads that were endorsed
by other police organizations.</i>

28:31.168 --> 28:36.340
One of the tips was a Canadian
RCMP officer named Galina.

28:37.883 --> 28:41.511
<i>He said that his informant</i>

28:41.595 --> 28:45.349
<i>told him
that there was a hit ordered</i>

28:45.432 --> 28:49.436
<i>on a Pakistani family
living in Bellevue, Washington.</i>

28:49.519 --> 28:54.691
<i>And he said he received that information
before the Rafay family was murdered.</i>

28:54.775 --> 28:57.736
So once he learned of the murders,

28:57.819 --> 29:00.072
he thought,
"Oh, I have relevant information."

29:00.155 --> 29:03.033
And he went down to the Bellevue police
and told them about this.

29:04.117 --> 29:08.747
[Isaacs] <i>The next tip was the Seattle</i>
<i>police, who contacted the Bellevue police</i>

29:08.830 --> 29:14.628
and told them that they believed
an organization called Al-Fuqra

29:14.711 --> 29:17.172
was involved in the death of the Rafays.

29:20.968 --> 29:26.723
[Isaacs] <i>Al-Fuqra is a U.S.-based</i>
<i>terrorist organization.</i>

29:28.433 --> 29:32.020
[Konat] <i>It's inconceivable to me</i>
<i>that somebody would come in</i>

29:32.104 --> 29:36.483
and beat the brains out of three
human beings over one man's belief

29:36.566 --> 29:40.696
that True East was one-and-a-half degrees
off on the compass.

29:50.664 --> 29:54.835
[Klonsky] <i>The killing of the Rafay family</i>
<i>was so vicious.</i>

29:54.918 --> 29:59.256
<i>In my view, it has nothing to do
with Islam or the Muslim religion.</i>

29:59.339 --> 30:04.761
I think it has to do with the way people
take these ideas to an extreme.

30:04.845 --> 30:06.096
It's extremism.

30:19.109 --> 30:24.781
[Isaacs] <i>That kind of violence related</i>
<i>to this community and that area</i>

30:24.865 --> 30:27.701
was probably just very alien
to Detective Thompson.

30:27.784 --> 30:29.619
And it didn't resonate with him.

30:29.703 --> 30:32.664
And he probably didn't really know
how to follow up on it.

30:32.748 --> 30:35.000
[Hutchinson] <i>In the post 9/11 world,</i>

30:35.083 --> 30:38.503
<i>would they have pursued this line
of investigative inquiry?</i>

30:38.587 --> 30:41.173
Almost certainly they would have
pursued it with more vigor.

30:42.299 --> 30:48.764
But this took place years before 9/11,
and they didn't go there.

30:51.350 --> 30:54.436
[Isaacs] <i>The best quality information</i>
<i>that's ever come forward on this case</i>

30:54.519 --> 30:59.441
was the FBI contacted the Bellevue Police
and informed them

30:59.524 --> 31:03.320
that one of their informants
had information about the Rafay murders

31:03.403 --> 31:05.781
<i>and was going to come
to the Bellevue Police Department</i>

31:05.864 --> 31:07.240
<i>and give that information.</i>

31:08.867 --> 31:13.705
The FBI informant told them
that he, himself, personally knew

31:13.789 --> 31:16.958
<i>an imam who lived in the area</i>

31:17.042 --> 31:20.337
<i>who had ordered the murder
of Dr. Rafay and his family.</i>

31:21.880 --> 31:24.257
<i>And he knew the two men</i>

31:24.341 --> 31:27.302
<i>that he says actually went
and committed the murders.</i>

31:27.386 --> 31:31.056
Then he went on to tell them
that he was with one of those men.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.851
<i>And the man opened the trunk of his car...</i>

31:35.894 --> 31:39.314
<i>and the informant saw a baseball bat.</i>

31:39.398 --> 31:41.691
<i>And because of the way this guy behaved,</i>

31:41.775 --> 31:45.445
the informant drew the conclusion
that that was the murder weapon.

31:45.529 --> 31:48.198
That was only a few days
after the murders.

31:48.281 --> 31:50.200
The Bellevue police, at that time,

31:50.283 --> 31:54.329
did not know that the Rafays
were killed with a baseball bat.

31:55.497 --> 31:59.709
<i>Some months later, the Bellevue police,
through sound recreations...</i>

32:01.294 --> 32:06.925
<i>determined that the Rafay family
was murdered with a baseball bat.</i>

32:09.344 --> 32:10.971
<i>That's not a coincidence.</i>

32:11.054 --> 32:15.559
And this FBI informant did not come
to them with vague information.

32:15.642 --> 32:18.228
<i>He gave them the names of the people</i>

32:18.311 --> 32:21.022
<i>that he believed were responsible
for these murders.</i>

32:21.106 --> 32:24.484
<i>He gave where they worked.
He gave their addresses.</i>

32:24.568 --> 32:29.364
<i>He gave phone numbers.
He also provided them with photographs.</i>

32:29.448 --> 32:32.617
[Fisher] <i>I think that's one of the most</i>
<i>appalling things about this case to me</i>

32:32.701 --> 32:35.245
is that they did not take
that information more seriously.

32:35.328 --> 32:37.914
<i>They kind of described
this informant dismissively</i>

32:37.998 --> 32:41.835
<i>as if he were crazy or something
because he gave them a long list of names.</i>

32:41.918 --> 32:45.005
But if you're talking
about an entire extremist organization,

32:45.088 --> 32:46.941
there's probably going to be
a long list of names.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.085
And maybe you should follow up
on some of those names.

32:49.134 --> 32:50.635
But that was not done.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.823
[Thompson] <i>In every murder case,</i>
<i>people come forward</i>

32:53.847 --> 32:55.724
<i>with information all the time.</i>

32:55.807 --> 33:00.479
Could you investigate
every single tip to the nth degree?

33:00.562 --> 33:02.355
Yeah, you can.

33:02.439 --> 33:04.983
But the reality is you have to come back

33:05.066 --> 33:07.944
to where the evidence is
and follow the evidence.

33:08.028 --> 33:10.071
And that will lead you
to the real killers.

33:12.908 --> 33:15.160
<i>There's all kinds of physical
and forensic evidence</i>

33:15.243 --> 33:19.122
that actually points away
from the two boys.

33:19.206 --> 33:21.750
<i>It doesn't point
to any other specific individuals</i>

33:21.833 --> 33:25.921
<i>because there were no other suspects
that the police actually took seriously.</i>

33:27.964 --> 33:30.634
There's a couple items of DNA evidence.

33:30.717 --> 33:35.680
So in Dr. Rafay's room,
there is a hair...

33:37.349 --> 33:42.771
<i>which doesn't belong to any of the victims
and not Sebastian and not Atif.</i>

33:44.648 --> 33:48.735
And then there's also bloodstains
in the garage of the house.

33:48.818 --> 33:54.824
<i>And again, the DNA in those bloodstains
don't match Sebastian, don't match Atif.</i>

33:54.908 --> 33:58.620
In addition, the police were able
to pinpoint the time of the murder.

33:58.703 --> 34:03.083
They interviewed both
of the neighbors independently.

34:04.334 --> 34:05.774
[woman] <i>I started to think about it,</i>

34:05.835 --> 34:09.965
<i>and I realized that I had heard
a hammering sound that night,</i>

34:10.048 --> 34:11.633
<i>when I was up reading.</i>

34:11.716 --> 34:14.553
[man] <i>I heard, like, a construction</i>
<i>project next door.</i>

34:14.636 --> 34:16.596
<i>I didn't really know
the neighbors that well.</i>

34:17.597 --> 34:20.976
The neighbors both pinpointed
the same timeframe.

34:21.977 --> 34:26.481
[woman] <i>I think it was about 9:30,</i>
<i>9:35 or so.</i>

34:26.565 --> 34:28.525
<i>It could've been
a little sooner than that.</i>

34:28.608 --> 34:31.861
<i>It could've been as early as 9:15.</i>

34:31.945 --> 34:33.780
[detective] <i>Can you give me</i>
<i>a window of time</i>

34:33.863 --> 34:36.992
<i>when that 20 minutes of sound
was occurring?</i>

34:37.075 --> 34:42.622
[man] <i>It would definitely be between</i>
<i>ten minutes to 9:00 and 9:35.</i>

34:42.706 --> 34:47.586
But, at that time,
Sebastian and Atif were seen,

34:47.669 --> 34:51.214
and it has been confirmed
they were at that movie theater.

34:52.799 --> 34:59.306
<i>So all of this focused effort
of the police department yielded evidence</i>

34:59.389 --> 35:04.185
that proved Sebastian
and Atif's innocence.

35:04.269 --> 35:07.022
You can always look
at other outside things.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.817
But it always comes back
to Burns and Rafay.

35:13.862 --> 35:17.532
[Thompson] <i>One of the things we know</i>
<i>for certain is that the killer showered.</i>

35:17.616 --> 35:20.619
<i>There's a chemical that we sprayed
inside that shower downstairs,</i>

35:20.702 --> 35:24.748
<i>and it just lit up with blood
from Dr. Rafay.</i>

35:25.457 --> 35:30.170
<i>There were 22 hairs in the bottom
of that shower, in the corners</i>

35:30.253 --> 35:33.298
<i>and in the sides
and in the base of the shower.</i>

35:33.381 --> 35:35.550
So the last person
who showered was the killer.

35:35.634 --> 35:39.304
And 22 hairs in that shower
belong to Sebastian Burns.

35:45.101 --> 35:47.979
<i>We found their underwear
in the washing machine</i>

35:48.063 --> 35:52.484
<i>that had been run through a spin cycle
and it had already been washed.</i>

35:52.567 --> 35:56.196
<i>It was just underwear.
And it only fit Burns and Rafay.</i>

35:56.279 --> 35:58.080
<i>And we thought,
"Well, that's really strange."</i>

35:58.823 --> 36:03.036
But we sent that in for testing,
and there was nothing on there.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.356
[Thompson] <i>So the physical evidence</i>
<i>that we had in Bellevue,</i>

36:06.414 --> 36:07.999
<i>it wasn't enough to arrest them.</i>

36:09.959 --> 36:11.395
They had these two kids in their sights,

36:11.419 --> 36:14.798
and they were gonna put these two guys
away, by whatever means necessary.

36:14.881 --> 36:17.842
And they chose,
with the help of Canadian police,

36:17.926 --> 36:21.137
<i>to use an investigative technique
that's illegal in the U.S.</i>

36:38.113 --> 36:40.990
The time is 6:45,
and the date is, uh...

36:43.827 --> 36:46.287
- Fuck, I don't know what the date is.
- [man laughs]

36:46.371 --> 36:47.831
[Gary] <i>It's the 18th?</i>

36:47.914 --> 36:51.167
<i>Yeah, I thought so. I didn't wanna say
the wrong thing. Okay, start over.</i>

36:51.251 --> 36:57.215
Okay, the time is 6:45,
July 18th, 1995...

36:57.298 --> 36:58.298
in Victoria.

37:00.510 --> 37:01.845
Re: The "Estate" file.

37:03.430 --> 37:08.143
[Isaacs] <i>The Bellevue police,</i>
<i>in coordination with the RCMP,</i>

37:08.226 --> 37:13.690
issued a press release about how
they were going to test the DNA.

37:13.773 --> 37:17.902
<i>It was not an actual reflection
of what was going on in the case.</i>

37:17.986 --> 37:24.492
It was to create the false world
that Mr. Big was creating for Sebastian

37:24.576 --> 37:27.829
so that he would think
that they were going to be convicted.

37:33.209 --> 37:34.930
[Gary] So you been
reading the paper lately?

37:36.379 --> 37:39.674
- Yeah, most of it.
- [Gary] What do you think?

37:42.218 --> 37:43.803
It's nothing new, I guess.

37:43.887 --> 37:47.390
And that was timed
for the Mr. Big sting.

37:49.434 --> 37:54.105
[Gary] I'm gonna show you somethin'.
You never fuckin' saw this from me.

37:54.189 --> 37:56.649
[Konat] <i>One of the last scenarios involved</i>

37:56.733 --> 38:00.570
the undercover operator showing them
some bogus memo

38:00.653 --> 38:04.783
<i>that the RCMP had prepared,
saying that there was both hair evidence</i>

38:04.866 --> 38:08.286
<i>and DNA evidence that had been collected
from the crime scene.</i>

38:08.369 --> 38:10.371
All of which is true.

38:10.455 --> 38:13.666
<i>The memo said that,
as a result of this new evidence,</i>

38:13.750 --> 38:16.711
<i>that they were preparing to file charges
against the two of them,</i>

38:16.795 --> 38:18.171
which was not true.

38:19.172 --> 38:22.509
"Red fabric fibers found in the shower
that are mixed with Burns' hair." Like...

38:22.592 --> 38:24.177
I mean...

38:24.260 --> 38:26.971
That... That could have been, like,
almost from any time.

38:27.055 --> 38:28.866
You know what I mean?
Like, 'cause I can't say that...

38:28.890 --> 38:31.130
[Gary] Obviously, they're referring
to the murder, right?

38:33.645 --> 38:36.022
Well, no, but what I'm saying is that I...

38:36.105 --> 38:38.786
I mean, that could have been there
from, like, two days before even.

38:38.817 --> 38:41.402
- Like, it doesn't sound like it...
- [Gary] Yeah, but hold it.

38:41.486 --> 38:44.607
The night you showered after the murder,
did you wash yourself with red towels?

38:46.282 --> 38:49.994
- Um... I don't even know.
- [Gary] What do you mean you don't know?

38:50.078 --> 38:52.080
I don't know, like...

38:52.163 --> 38:55.124
I don't remember what...
what fucking color the towels were there.

38:55.208 --> 39:00.255
Sebastian didn't understand how
there could be DNA on anything from him.

39:03.049 --> 39:04.676
<i>Especially if you're innocent,</i>

39:04.759 --> 39:06.928
why would there be any DNA found

39:07.011 --> 39:10.473
or anything that would tie him
to the murders?

39:10.557 --> 39:12.225
So he didn't believe it.

39:12.308 --> 39:14.602
And he kept trying to explain
that that's impossible.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.312
"These things didn't happen.

39:16.396 --> 39:18.523
I don't believe that
that could be the case."

39:20.400 --> 39:22.610
"Blood stains located in the garage."

39:23.987 --> 39:26.489
I don't know shit about bloodstains
in the garage.

39:26.573 --> 39:29.260
- I don't know a fucking thing.
- [Gary] I don't know. You were there.

39:29.284 --> 39:31.136
Like, if I knew,
I could fuckin' probably tell you.

39:31.160 --> 39:33.538
I don't know, and I can't start asking
all these questions.

39:33.621 --> 39:35.123
- Yeah.
- [Gary] Until I fuckin' know.

39:37.292 --> 39:40.753
- And that's the bottom line.
- Well, okay, but...

39:40.837 --> 39:42.422
I mean...

39:42.505 --> 39:46.175
There... There is this possibility
there can be things I don't know about...

39:46.259 --> 39:47.969
That, like, they're basically...

39:48.052 --> 39:51.055
fabricating to look like they count,
you know what I mean?

39:51.139 --> 39:54.392
[Gary] I don't believe they're sending
a report to the lab, or whatever this is

39:54.475 --> 39:56.978
asking to fabricate fuckin' evidence.

39:57.061 --> 40:00.481
Plenty of people are convicted
on false and bad evidence

40:00.565 --> 40:04.068
or manipulated evidence or factoids.

40:07.196 --> 40:10.742
Burns, by that time, was certain
that they were just targets,

40:10.825 --> 40:13.786
that people were trying
to pin it on them, no matter what.

40:13.870 --> 40:16.623
So if they have evidence
that is going to be used,

40:16.706 --> 40:18.917
even though they know they're innocent,

40:19.000 --> 40:21.377
they know they can
be convicted falsely of a crime

40:21.461 --> 40:23.296
if people put up some kind of evidence.

40:23.379 --> 40:28.635
So them being curious about what evidence
they have is no surprise. I would be.

40:28.718 --> 40:30.094
[Levine] <i>I'm accused of a murder,</i>

40:30.178 --> 40:34.807
<i>and I know that the police department
is coming after me, they wanna convict me.</i>

40:34.891 --> 40:38.311
And now this mob guy says,
"I can find out what they have."

40:38.394 --> 40:40.396
I would wanna know,
even though I'm innocent.

40:40.480 --> 40:44.651
You know, I...
Just some things I can't help you with,

40:44.734 --> 40:46.694
like some stains on boxer shorts
from the washer.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.172
I don't know what the fuck that is, okay?

40:48.196 --> 40:50.239
[Thompson] <i>If you were a suspect</i>
<i>in a murder case,</i>

40:50.323 --> 40:53.952
would you even be associating with
somebody who you think were criminals?

40:54.035 --> 40:57.080
Or would you just like,
"Look, I didn't do anything."

40:57.163 --> 40:58.998
[Gary] Listen to me.
I've got a way.

40:59.082 --> 41:01.125
It's all gonna be set up
to take care of the lab.

41:01.209 --> 41:02.710
You see what I'm saying?

41:02.794 --> 41:04.754
[Saunders] <i>The memo was fake,</i>
<i>but then they said,</i>

41:04.837 --> 41:09.175
"Our thugs, our minions
with tentacles everywhere,

41:09.258 --> 41:12.178
can get rid of that information
if you just confess."

41:12.261 --> 41:16.307
[Gary] Tell me what went on, and I'll tell
you how I'll take care of your problem.

41:16.391 --> 41:18.452
[Saunders] <i>They told them that they're</i>
<i>coming to get him</i>

41:18.476 --> 41:22.230
and then followed up with,
"You better spill it now

41:22.313 --> 41:25.358
because we'll make sure
that you're not arrested."

41:27.318 --> 41:30.697
[Gary] So when'd you fuckin'...
do the dirty deed?

41:33.616 --> 41:36.285
Um... during the movie.
