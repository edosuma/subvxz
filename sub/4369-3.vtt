WEBVTT

00:06.297 --> 00:08.129
Cyd, in honor
of the one-month
anniversary

00:08.129 --> 00:09.630
of you coming
to live with us,

00:09.630 --> 00:11.512
I've prepared
a special dish.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.975
Good, 'cause I've got
just the hole in my face
to stuff it into.

00:16.807 --> 00:20.061
Cyd, are you eating
before Mom tells
the story of the meal?

00:20.731 --> 00:21.982
No.

00:23.444 --> 00:24.445
Maybe.

00:27.358 --> 00:29.820
No.

00:29.820 --> 00:32.493
Kids, tonight's dinner
is a free-trade casserole

00:32.493 --> 00:34.325
with sustainable
mixed-veggies

00:34.325 --> 00:36.957
and cruelty-free chicken.

00:36.957 --> 00:39.250
How can chicken
be cruelty-free?

00:39.250 --> 00:40.541
It's not still alive, is it?

00:40.541 --> 00:42.253
Well, no. But it
was cruelty-free

00:42.253 --> 00:43.424
right until the end,

00:43.424 --> 00:44.375
where they probably
had to use

00:44.375 --> 00:45.666
a tiny-little
bit of cruelty.

00:45.666 --> 00:47.378
Just enough to...

00:47.378 --> 00:49.170
The skin is
really crispy!

00:50.551 --> 00:51.592
Like Chet at
the water park.

00:51.592 --> 00:53.974
(ALL LAUGHING)

00:53.974 --> 00:56.097
Oh, I get it.
He got sunburned
at the water park.

00:56.097 --> 00:58.639
No, he really likes
the crispy chicken there.

00:58.639 --> 01:00.020
We don't joke
about sunburn.

01:00.020 --> 01:01.352
With our
family's complexion,

01:01.352 --> 01:04.024
we all fry up like
center-cut bacon.

01:04.024 --> 01:06.527
Oh, I had no idea.
Sorry, Chet.

01:06.527 --> 01:09.570
I'm Bret.
You can tell because
I have more freckles.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.362
And he's
the ladies' man.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.244
'Sup?

01:14.405 --> 01:15.696
Well, everybody dig in.

01:17.698 --> 01:19.540
This is delicious, Astrid.

01:19.540 --> 01:21.872
Even before my parents left
for their archeological dig,

01:21.872 --> 01:24.255
they were never
really around much
for family dinners.

01:24.255 --> 01:25.756
Well, we are,
and we want
you to feel

01:25.756 --> 01:27.378
like this
is your home.

01:27.378 --> 01:29.170
Then set me in front
of the television

01:29.170 --> 01:32.012
with a leftover beef rib
and go do your thing.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.305
Ha-ha-ha.

01:34.305 --> 01:36.477
Would you laugh if I said
the rib was crispy?

01:36.477 --> 01:39.350
Oh no, sweetheart.
That means you're not
cooking them properly.

01:41.642 --> 01:43.063
I'm home.

01:43.063 --> 01:44.645
Hi, Dad.
 Hey, Dad!
How was work?

01:44.645 --> 01:46.647
Oh, just another
soul-crushing day

01:46.647 --> 01:49.940
trapped in the toothless
maw of corporate America.

01:49.940 --> 01:51.111
How was your day,
sweetie?

01:52.613 --> 01:54.114
Dad, you're
such a kidder.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.326
Sure, let's go with that.

01:56.657 --> 01:58.789
Mr. Marcus, what
exactly do you do?

01:58.789 --> 02:00.371
I've never really
been sure.

02:00.371 --> 02:02.413
Well, a lot of people think
that accounting is boring

02:02.413 --> 02:04.505
but what they
don't realize,

02:04.505 --> 02:06.377
there's a lot
of math involved.

02:08.048 --> 02:10.511
Cyd, for your one
month-aversary...

02:10.511 --> 02:11.882
We made you a cake!

02:11.882 --> 02:14.305
Let's go finish
decorating it, Bret!

02:14.305 --> 02:15.636
To the bedroom, Chet!

02:17.308 --> 02:18.969
They're decorating
a cake in their bedroom?

02:18.969 --> 02:20.931
Our boys are
free spirits, Norm.

02:20.931 --> 02:22.603
Don't stifle
their creativity.

02:22.603 --> 02:24.104
Is it really creativity,

02:24.104 --> 02:26.146
or is it not knowing what
different rooms are for?

02:26.146 --> 02:28.609
They moved their beds
into my mancave.

02:28.609 --> 02:30.191
That's their bedroom.

02:30.191 --> 02:31.402
Used to be my mancave.

02:33.324 --> 02:35.196
CHET: Don't let go
of the cart, Bret!

02:35.196 --> 02:37.448
BRET: No, you don't let
go of the cart, Chet!

02:37.448 --> 02:38.869
(THUDDING)

02:43.624 --> 02:45.376
Is it bad that
I'm still gonna
eat that?

03:46.897 --> 03:47.898
(BOTH SCREAMING)

03:49.650 --> 03:50.901
Barry, what are
you doing here?

03:50.901 --> 03:53.063
You can't just walk
into somebody's house.

03:53.063 --> 03:54.565
I'm not the best at
reading social cues,

03:54.565 --> 03:56.657
but I'm perceiving an
implied dinner invitation.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.531
Barry, we finished
eating an hour ago.

04:00.531 --> 04:02.122
Very well, if you insist.

04:03.824 --> 04:05.125
It's awkward for
me to sit here

04:05.125 --> 04:06.577
eating in silence.

04:06.577 --> 04:07.828
Please, engage in
mindless small talk.

04:07.828 --> 04:10.170
That month-aversary
dinner was pretty cool.

04:10.170 --> 04:12.423
Yeah, my mom's been
so excited about it.

04:12.423 --> 04:13.544
Good. Like that.

04:14.965 --> 04:16.637
Your parents
are so great.

04:16.637 --> 04:17.757
I want to find
a special way

04:17.757 --> 04:18.928
to thank them
for taking me in.

04:18.928 --> 04:21.141
Oh, you're doing
a special thank you?

04:21.141 --> 04:22.643
That's nice.
 You can help me.

04:22.643 --> 04:24.345
Yes!

04:24.345 --> 04:26.767
We're gonna come up with
such an awesome thank you

04:26.767 --> 04:28.349
that they're gonna
have to thank us.

04:28.349 --> 04:29.520
Then we'll have to come up

04:29.520 --> 04:30.891
with an awesome
"You're welcome."

04:30.891 --> 04:32.893
I have never
loved you more!

04:33.774 --> 04:35.195
I have to say,

04:35.195 --> 04:36.567
I don't see the need
for any kind of thank you.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.108
If someone's doing
something nice for you,

04:38.108 --> 04:39.239
it's because they want to.

04:39.239 --> 04:41.031
You still have
to thank people.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.823
Yeah, like maybe
you have something

04:42.823 --> 04:45.366
to say about
this food of ours
that you're eating.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.749
Could be warmer.

04:48.749 --> 04:50.541
So you never
say thank you?

04:50.541 --> 04:52.172
No. For example,

04:52.172 --> 04:53.624
right now, Renaldo's
off at the dump

04:53.624 --> 04:55.716
catching rats for
my latest experiment.

04:55.716 --> 04:57.548
I have no intention
of thanking him.

04:57.548 --> 04:59.880
He will be greeted
by a reminder to
sanitize his skin

04:59.880 --> 05:02.262
and burn his
clothes before
re-entering my lab.

05:02.262 --> 05:04.345
Followed by a hearty,
"What took you so long?"

05:06.727 --> 05:08.599
So what are we thinking
for this big thank you?

05:08.599 --> 05:09.690
Polynesian theme
with hula dancers...

05:09.690 --> 05:11.432
Ooh, and fire jugglers!

05:11.432 --> 05:12.693
Or circus theme
with clowns...

05:12.693 --> 05:14.234
Jumping through
hoops of fire!

05:14.234 --> 05:17.147
Or a heavy metal theme with
a guitar that shoots fire.

05:17.147 --> 05:18.699
I have never
loved you more.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.242
This is going to be
the best thank you ever.

05:22.242 --> 05:24.154
Nothing says
thank you like fire.

05:24.154 --> 05:25.536
This cake is awful.

05:25.536 --> 05:26.747
It tastes like
it's been the floor.

05:26.747 --> 05:27.868
It was on the floor.

05:27.868 --> 05:29.119
Well, in that case,
it's not bad.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.379
I'm back from
the dump and...

05:38.379 --> 05:40.260
And did you burn
your clothes and douse
yourself in disinfectant?

05:40.260 --> 05:41.341
Oh, right.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.765
I'm back from
the dump and...
 Shoes.

05:44.765 --> 05:45.766
Oh, right.

05:47.808 --> 05:49.560
I'm back from
the dump and...

05:49.560 --> 05:52.523
After removing the
contaminated shoes,
did you re-disinfect?

05:52.523 --> 05:53.644
Oh, right.

05:55.275 --> 05:58.108
I'm back from
the dump and...

05:58.108 --> 06:01.532
"And" what? We don't have
all day for your shenanigans.

06:01.532 --> 06:03.574
I got this box of rats
for our experiment.

06:03.574 --> 06:04.745
Perfect.

06:04.745 --> 06:07.327
We are all set
to perform
our experiment

06:07.327 --> 06:09.580
wherein we will expose
these dump rats

06:09.580 --> 06:10.831
to the good life

06:10.831 --> 06:12.122
then drop them off
at the country club

06:12.122 --> 06:13.333
and see how
they blend in.

06:13.333 --> 06:14.875
Is this an experiment,

06:14.875 --> 06:16.497
or revenge on
the country club
for kicking us out?

06:16.497 --> 06:17.758
Why can't it be both?

06:19.630 --> 06:21.592
We will begin
by feeding them

06:21.592 --> 06:24.675
French Brie and fresh
figs on toast points.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.887
Oh, that looks
so good.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.969
Renaldo, would you like
a toast point with French
Brie and fresh figs?

06:28.969 --> 06:30.891
Usually, I like
my Brie domestic,

06:30.891 --> 06:33.103
but flexibility
is the hallmark
of a refined palate.

06:33.103 --> 06:35.065
This is what I get
for exposing you
to the good life.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.229
Thanks.

06:39.229 --> 06:40.731
Interesting you
should thank me.

06:40.731 --> 06:42.653
Cyd and Shelby were just
discussing this concept.

06:42.653 --> 06:44.655
See, I always believed
that, as men of science,

06:44.655 --> 06:46.286
we are above
social graces.

06:46.286 --> 06:49.490
You know, like saying,
"Thank you for getting
the zargon gas"

06:49.490 --> 06:51.121
or, "Please pass
the zargon gas,"

06:51.121 --> 06:52.743
or, "Pardon me
for blasting you

06:52.743 --> 06:54.955
"with dangerously high
levels of zargon gas."

06:56.587 --> 06:58.499
I believe you should
always be nice, Barry.

06:58.499 --> 07:00.170
And no worries about
the zargon gas.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.421
My bellybutton
grew back.

07:02.503 --> 07:03.924
Well, in that case,
Renaldo,

07:03.924 --> 07:06.046
there is something
very important I
have to say to you.

07:07.047 --> 07:09.139
Thank you.
For everything.

07:09.139 --> 07:11.051
No problem, bud.

07:11.051 --> 07:12.853
That thank you was
the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

07:12.853 --> 07:15.936
And I once had to make
a fake belly button out
of silicone.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.107
I mean, nothing.

07:21.732 --> 07:24.364
This big thank you is
really coming together.

07:24.364 --> 07:26.777
We've got flaming jugglers,
flaming hoops,

07:26.777 --> 07:28.158
flaming guitars,
and waffles.

07:28.158 --> 07:31.872
'Cause fire's great,
but it's not delicious.

07:31.872 --> 07:34.495
I can't wait to see
the looks on your
parents' faces.

07:34.495 --> 07:36.627
We don't have to wait.
Let's jump forward.

07:41.842 --> 07:43.674
You think waffles
caused this?

07:46.346 --> 07:49.009
I'm not hurt.
But I love
being carried.

07:50.761 --> 07:53.684
It's like I'm
flying, Bret.

07:57.648 --> 07:59.439
What the heck
happened here?

07:59.439 --> 08:00.901
Your mother asked
you a question.

08:00.901 --> 08:03.023
What the heck
happened here?

08:03.023 --> 08:04.865
That's what
you said, right?

08:04.865 --> 08:06.196
I was a little
distracted
by the smoke

08:06.196 --> 08:07.447
and the burning
and the twins
riding firemen.

08:15.666 --> 08:17.918
Girls, I asked
you a question.

08:17.918 --> 08:19.790
Why won't I leave
a job that I hate?

08:21.922 --> 08:24.835
Norm, you asked them
what happened here.

08:24.835 --> 08:27.007
Right, right.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.219
But if you have an answer
to that first question,

08:29.219 --> 08:30.841
that would be good, too.

08:34.134 --> 08:35.726
Ugh! 10:03.

08:35.726 --> 08:37.688
Good. We're back
to before the fire.

08:37.688 --> 08:40.941
I don't get it.
How could my big
thank you go so wrong?

08:40.941 --> 08:42.982
Nothing says
thank you like fire.

08:42.982 --> 08:46.526
But sometimes fire says,
"Ah! I'm gonna burn stuff!"

08:46.526 --> 08:48.488
Sometimes, fire bad.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.782
This is awful.

08:51.782 --> 08:54.074
All I wanted to do
was thank your parents
for letting me stay here.

08:54.074 --> 08:56.827
It's great we got that
glimpse of the future.

08:56.827 --> 08:59.830
Now we can avoid it
by doing a big thank you
without fire.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.832
I mean, other things
say thank you.

09:01.832 --> 09:03.624
Like making
a thank you movie.

09:03.624 --> 09:05.085
We could get big stars
to be in it

09:05.085 --> 09:07.257
by offering them parts
they don't usually get
to play.

09:07.257 --> 09:10.300
Sandy Bullock as
the cranky old prospector!

09:12.132 --> 09:13.844
Where's the thank
you in that?

09:13.844 --> 09:16.226
In our acceptance speech at
the Independent Spirit Awards.

09:17.678 --> 09:19.229
It just doesn't
feel like me,

09:19.229 --> 09:21.942
among many other
problems with that.

09:21.942 --> 09:23.774
Maybe we should just
do something simple

09:23.774 --> 09:25.485
and say the words
"Thank you."

09:25.485 --> 09:28.899
Look, I know my family.
Don't give up on big.

09:28.899 --> 09:30.030
It's what I always
do for them

09:30.030 --> 09:31.451
on birthdays
and anniversaries.

09:31.451 --> 09:32.613
They love it.

09:32.613 --> 09:33.994
I hear you,
but I got this.

09:33.994 --> 09:35.866
This really should
be my thank you.

09:35.866 --> 09:38.458
Cyd, we made you
another cake to say...

09:38.458 --> 09:40.540
Sorry we dropped
the first cake.

09:53.383 --> 09:54.845
Why does this
keep happening?

09:59.349 --> 10:00.681
You're not getting
any num-nums

10:00.681 --> 10:02.432
until you listen to all
four movements

10:02.432 --> 10:04.815
of Mozart's
 Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.

10:04.815 --> 10:06.857
(MUSIC PLAYING ON HEADPHONES)

10:09.609 --> 10:11.071
I wish this was
the weirdest thing

10:11.071 --> 10:14.194
I've walked in on
in this RV.

10:14.194 --> 10:16.827
So, I need to find
a way to thank
Shelby's parents.

10:16.827 --> 10:18.949
I'm thinking maybe
just a simple thank you.

10:18.949 --> 10:20.040
Yes. Keep it simple.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.541
That's what I did
when I thanked Renaldo.

10:21.541 --> 10:24.204
If that's what you did,
then it's got to be wrong!

10:24.204 --> 10:26.917
You have the emotional
IQ of soft toast!

10:26.917 --> 10:28.008
You mean bread?

10:29.800 --> 10:30.921
A thank you
is not enough.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.462
I need some
kind of a gesture.

10:32.462 --> 10:33.964
Wait, does this mean
I need a gesture?

10:33.964 --> 10:35.966
I thought I was out
clean with the thank you.

10:35.966 --> 10:37.888
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me,

10:37.888 --> 10:39.309
and I was once hung
from the flagpole

10:39.309 --> 10:40.891
by someone
else's underwear.

10:42.312 --> 10:44.564
Words are too little,
but fire's too much.

10:44.564 --> 10:46.436
What's the sweet spot
between soft toast

10:46.436 --> 10:48.068
and burning down
the house?

10:48.068 --> 10:49.229
Actual toast?

10:50.821 --> 10:52.943
You don't
understand anything!

10:52.943 --> 10:54.234
That's what I've
been telling you!

10:54.234 --> 10:56.276
The whole human race
is a mystery to me.

10:56.276 --> 10:57.828
Look at lucky Eleanor.

10:57.828 --> 10:59.369
She doesn't have
to say "Thank you."

10:59.369 --> 11:01.411
Hence the expression,
"Happy as a rat."

11:01.411 --> 11:03.123
I'm pretty sure that's
not an expression.

11:03.123 --> 11:04.584
Then if nothing else
comes of my research,

11:04.584 --> 11:06.787
it will be the expression
"Happy as a rat."

11:14.715 --> 11:16.847
Hi, Mr. Marcus,
Astrid.

11:16.847 --> 11:18.638
Oh, Cyd, I'm sure
Mr. Marcus wouldn't mind

11:18.638 --> 11:20.300
if you called him Norm.

11:20.300 --> 11:24.104
Actually, I've always
secretly wanted to
be called Norm.

11:24.104 --> 11:25.435
Are you hearing
the difference?

11:25.435 --> 11:26.807
It's subtle,
but it's there.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.229
Just like you, sweetheart.

11:30.861 --> 11:33.313
The thing is,
you've been so great
letting me stay here.

11:33.313 --> 11:34.945
I wanted to say thank you

11:34.945 --> 11:36.576
in a way that was
bigger than words

11:36.576 --> 11:38.819
but smaller than
burning down the house.

11:38.819 --> 11:40.700
Was she thinking
of burning down
our house?

11:42.322 --> 11:45.746
Oh, Cyd, it's a plant.
Isn't it lovely, Norm?

11:45.746 --> 11:48.538
I'm still a little stuck
on this burning down
the house thing.

11:50.630 --> 11:53.543
But that plant's not all
Cyd did to thank you.

11:53.543 --> 11:55.756
She also did this!

11:57.007 --> 11:58.969
(NORM LAUGHS)

11:58.969 --> 12:01.101
I love the way you
lowered our expectations
with the plant,

12:01.101 --> 12:03.974
and then boom!
Brought the zazzle!

12:04.845 --> 12:07.607
Hula dancers,
clowns, rockers.

12:07.607 --> 12:10.270
Oh, I feel thanked.

12:10.270 --> 12:13.353
Stop trying to lick
your fingers while
pushing the cake, Chet.

12:13.353 --> 12:15.856
Stop telling me how
to lick my fingers, Bret.

12:19.659 --> 12:21.161
Cyd, wait.

12:21.161 --> 12:23.283
You didn't taste the cake.

12:23.283 --> 12:25.165
Heavy metal luau circus!

12:25.165 --> 12:27.247
It's like someone read
my dream journal!

12:27.247 --> 12:31.751
On an unrelated note,
I am returning
your dream journal.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.004
CHET: We made it
to the top of
the stairs, Bret.

12:34.004 --> 12:36.136
BRET: Give me
a high five, Chet!

12:36.136 --> 12:38.258
(THUDDING)

12:43.884 --> 12:46.766
I'm starting to accept that
as a thing that just happens.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.693
According to Cyd,
I needed a gesture
to thank you.

12:53.693 --> 12:57.277
So here's a house plant.
I hope you're happy.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.990
I'm always happy.
It's what people
like best about me.

12:59.990 --> 13:02.032
Well, that and the way
my earwax tastes.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.533
I think it's gross,
but people love it.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.076
So what's the plant for?

13:06.076 --> 13:08.708
It's for helping me
with my experiments.

13:08.708 --> 13:10.871
That really hurts.
I can't believe
you said that.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.585
You're leaving me here
to massage the rats?

13:15.585 --> 13:17.337
I can't do deep tissue.

13:17.337 --> 13:19.840
Some of these rats
have sports injuries!

13:32.232 --> 13:35.986
Cyd, you're missing all
the fun of our big thank you.

13:35.986 --> 13:38.648
The Hawaiian dancers
are teaching Bret
and Chet how to hula,

13:38.648 --> 13:41.241
and Bret and Chet
are making them regret
every second of it.

13:45.405 --> 13:48.118
I'm doing
the perfect
Kaholo, Bret!

13:48.118 --> 13:50.790
No, I'm doing
a perfect
Kaholo, Chet!

13:53.043 --> 13:55.085
So come on.
Let's get down there.

13:55.085 --> 13:58.088
No, I don't want to.

13:58.088 --> 14:00.670
Are you disappointed
because we couldn't
do fire?

14:00.670 --> 14:02.132
We saw how
that turned out.

14:02.132 --> 14:04.174
But we avoided
the bad future we saw

14:04.174 --> 14:06.226
and pulled off
an awesome thank you.

14:06.226 --> 14:09.930
No, you pulled off
an awesome thank you.

14:16.146 --> 14:18.738
I took over
your thing, didn't I?

14:18.738 --> 14:21.691
Look, I'm sorry,
I just wanted to help.

14:21.691 --> 14:23.153
Come on, let's jump
back and redo it

14:23.153 --> 14:25.365
and this time,
I'll stay out of it.

14:26.246 --> 14:29.159
No, it's too late.

14:29.159 --> 14:31.251
It's never too late.
We're time travelers!

14:32.252 --> 14:34.084
Time travel won't help.

14:34.084 --> 14:36.376
Did she just
say time travel?

14:36.376 --> 14:39.169
Oh, Norm, you sound crazy
when you say stuff like that.

14:42.342 --> 14:44.134
I know
what I did wrong.
Let me fix it.

14:45.175 --> 14:46.886
You don't know
what you did wrong

14:46.886 --> 14:49.599
'cause you didn't
do anything wrong!

14:49.599 --> 14:51.351
Then what's
the problem?

14:51.351 --> 14:54.354
I'm the problem.
I don't fit in
with this family.

14:54.354 --> 14:55.475
What are you
talking about?

14:55.475 --> 14:57.187
I don't get your
family's jokes,

14:57.187 --> 14:58.518
I start eating
dinner too soon,

14:58.518 --> 14:59.779
I can't tell your
brothers apart.

14:59.779 --> 15:01.111
Chet's the ladies' man.

15:02.112 --> 15:03.283
'Sup?

15:06.366 --> 15:08.828
I can't even thank your
parents the right way.

15:08.828 --> 15:10.910
You had to come in and
save it so they would like it.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.242
None of that matters.

15:12.242 --> 15:15.875
It matters 'cause
I'm living here now.

15:15.875 --> 15:18.798
I come from a family
that's not really close.

15:18.798 --> 15:22.212
I don't know how to be
a part of a family that is.

15:22.212 --> 15:24.214
And time travel
won't fix that.

15:36.266 --> 15:39.649
And then Cyd stormed
off, really upset.

15:39.649 --> 15:41.231
Renaldo stormed off.

15:41.231 --> 15:42.942
It's not possible
he was upset, is it?

15:42.942 --> 15:45.565
Cyd feels like she's
not a part of my family.

15:45.565 --> 15:47.487
Did her storming
off look like this?

15:47.487 --> 15:48.989
(SIGHS ANGRILY)

15:51.331 --> 15:52.242
Like a tougher
version of that.

15:54.244 --> 15:56.666
How can Cyd feel
like she's not
a part of my family?

15:56.666 --> 15:58.288
We love her.

15:58.288 --> 16:00.790
Is it possible Renaldo
feels like he's not
a part of my lab?

16:00.790 --> 16:02.582
I mean, with all
the zargon gas
he's inhaled,

16:02.582 --> 16:04.174
my lab is
a part of him.

16:05.345 --> 16:06.846
I need to do
something for Cyd

16:06.846 --> 16:08.258
to show her how much
we care about her.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.470
First a thank you,
then a gesture,

16:10.470 --> 16:12.302
now I have to
do something?

16:12.302 --> 16:13.683
When the machines rise,

16:13.683 --> 16:15.305
all of human interaction
will be dispensed with

16:15.305 --> 16:19.269
and I tell you that day
cannot come soon enough!

16:19.269 --> 16:21.771
What are we
talking about again?

16:21.771 --> 16:24.194
What am I going to do
to show Cyd we care?

16:24.194 --> 16:26.156
All the rockers
and clowns have
gone home!

16:26.156 --> 16:27.737
And the twins
are weeks away

16:27.737 --> 16:30.410
from being able to pull off
a decent Kaholo hula.

16:30.410 --> 16:32.112
Really? But
it's so simple.

16:32.112 --> 16:34.164
Just let your arms feel
the island breeze

16:34.164 --> 16:36.246
and let your hips
guide you to paradise.

16:39.959 --> 16:40.960
What are we
talking about again?

16:48.178 --> 16:49.759
There's nothing
to eat in this house.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.342
All those stupid clowns
cleaned us out.

16:52.342 --> 16:54.224
Free-loading
circus freaks.

16:54.224 --> 16:56.476
Okay, no need
to get offensive.
 Is that offensive?

16:56.476 --> 16:58.688
I don't know, it sounds
like it kinda could be.

16:59.939 --> 17:02.102
BOTH: Eh!

17:02.102 --> 17:04.854
Cyd...
 Shelby, I know what
you're going to say,

17:04.854 --> 17:07.906
and no amount of clowns
and jugglers and skywriters

17:07.906 --> 17:10.319
and stilt-walkers
will make me feel...
 Cyd.

17:10.319 --> 17:11.820
(SHUSHING)

17:24.503 --> 17:27.547
Let me tell
you the story
of this burrito.

17:28.588 --> 17:31.471
The tortilla
is our home.

17:31.471 --> 17:35.555
My parents are the rice.
My brothers are the beans.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.267
Is it because...
 Yes, it's because.

17:38.478 --> 17:40.560
And I am the cheese.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.601
Is it because
you're cheesy?

17:41.601 --> 17:44.104
No, it's because
I'm shredded!

17:44.104 --> 17:45.815
Yeah, it's
'cause I'm cheesy.

17:47.527 --> 17:50.400
And this is our family.

17:53.153 --> 17:54.904
And this is you, Cyd.

17:56.035 --> 17:59.409
You're the fire.
You make it special.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.703
That's really sweet, Shelby.

18:03.703 --> 18:06.546
And I know you love me,

18:06.546 --> 18:08.378
but this doesn't
change anything.

18:12.802 --> 18:14.174
Thanks for the burrito.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.308
Cyd, wait.

18:24.434 --> 18:26.726
We thought the fire
we saw in the future

18:26.726 --> 18:28.608
was from your
big thank you.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.491
But all along it was from
your "Feel better burrito."

18:33.153 --> 18:35.495
I'm not hurt.
But I love
being carried.

18:37.697 --> 18:40.450
It's like I'm
flying, Bret.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.874
Is it bad that I want
to be carried by a fireman?

18:44.874 --> 18:46.166
Nope, totally get it.

18:50.550 --> 18:51.591
Hey, Barry.
You wanted to talk?

18:51.591 --> 18:54.634
Yes, Renaldo. Here.

18:54.634 --> 18:55.755
What's with the burrito?

18:55.755 --> 18:58.348
It's Shelby's family,
and the candle is Cyd.

18:59.429 --> 19:00.520
What does that mean?

19:00.520 --> 19:02.642
I have no idea.
I don't understand
any of this.

19:04.394 --> 19:05.855
You're the one
who stormed out

19:05.855 --> 19:07.437
because you don't feel
like you're part of the lab.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.859
I stormed out because I do
feel like I'm part of the lab!

19:09.859 --> 19:11.271
So we're good?

19:11.271 --> 19:13.823
Barry, when you
gave me that plant,

19:13.823 --> 19:16.576
you made me feel like
you were paying me
to be your friend.

19:16.576 --> 19:17.987
I thought we
were a team.

19:17.987 --> 19:19.619
I thought we
were playing
scientist together.

19:19.619 --> 19:20.950
We're not
playing scientist.

19:20.950 --> 19:22.622
I know! That's why
I got so mad!

19:22.622 --> 19:24.624
I love playing scientist!

19:24.624 --> 19:26.456
It's not a game!
 Not anymore!

19:28.087 --> 19:29.709
Renaldo, I'll
make you a deal.

19:29.709 --> 19:32.091
Let's pretend the last
two days never happened.

19:32.091 --> 19:33.092
Done.

19:34.464 --> 19:36.055
Why are Cyd and Shelby
having so much trouble?

19:36.055 --> 19:37.387
This is so
easy for us.

19:37.387 --> 19:38.508
'Cause we're dudes.

19:38.508 --> 19:40.470
True, everything we do
makes way more sense.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.722
Now let's get
these pampered rats
their poolside smoothies.

19:42.722 --> 19:44.103
(SQUEAKING)

19:52.862 --> 19:54.654
What the heck
happened here?

19:54.654 --> 19:55.905
Mom, it's my fault.

19:55.905 --> 19:57.407
But I'm the one who threw
the candle in the trash.

19:57.407 --> 19:58.818
I'm the one who
gave her the candle.

19:58.818 --> 20:00.490
She said she was going
to burn down the house.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.532
And she did it.

20:02.532 --> 20:04.374
I wish I had that
kinda follow through.

20:05.415 --> 20:07.287
This is all my fault.

20:07.287 --> 20:09.499
All I wanted was
to show you guys how I feel,

20:09.499 --> 20:12.712
but I'm not good
at that kind of thing.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.924
My family
doesn't do that.

20:14.924 --> 20:16.546
I know they love me,

20:16.546 --> 20:18.047
but they're just
not that involved.

20:19.469 --> 20:21.471
You guys have been
so good to me

20:21.471 --> 20:25.224
and you've taken me
into your home

20:25.224 --> 20:27.727
and it all
means so much.

20:27.727 --> 20:32.061
So, I just wanted
to say thank you.

20:32.061 --> 20:34.444
Oh, Cyd, that
was beautiful.

20:35.565 --> 20:37.156
We got a gusher.

20:37.156 --> 20:39.489
Stop it.
 No, I'm talking about him.

20:39.489 --> 20:40.570
Don't look at me.

20:46.706 --> 20:50.630
Do you think we should jump
back so that burrito fire
never happens?

20:50.630 --> 20:52.542
Are you kidding?

20:52.542 --> 20:56.135
That burrito fire led
to the best thank you
this family's ever seen.

20:56.135 --> 20:57.837
You totally fit in.

20:57.837 --> 20:59.469
Let's not
change a thing.

21:00.880 --> 21:02.181
They're hugging Cyd!

21:02.181 --> 21:03.723
Let's get in
on that, Bret!

21:03.723 --> 21:06.846
BOTH: Aw! Ugh!

21:16.316 --> 21:17.567
Ugh! It's wax.
