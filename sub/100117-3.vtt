WEBVTT

00:02.089 --> 00:03.307
Aah!

00:06.397 --> 00:08.443
Well, look.
I -- I know it's weird.

00:08.486 --> 00:09.835
Okay, uh...

00:09.879 --> 00:11.228
Where do I start?

00:13.230 --> 00:14.840
So, Jack is...

00:14.884 --> 00:16.233
-Dead.
-Killed by God.

00:16.277 --> 00:18.148
-Belphegor's the name.
-You're Belphegor?

00:18.192 --> 00:20.542
I can't even look at him.
He's an abomination!

00:20.585 --> 00:23.806
I was told that Belphegor was
a monstrous threat to humanity.

00:23.849 --> 00:25.025
Who told you that?

00:25.068 --> 00:27.201
An attractive female demon
named --

00:27.244 --> 00:28.245
Ardat.

00:28.289 --> 00:30.291
This is awkward.

00:30.334 --> 00:31.814
Knock, knock.

00:31.857 --> 00:34.164
Am I interrupting
something juicy?

00:34.208 --> 00:37.124
Rowena's working on a little
gadget that vacuums up souls.

00:37.167 --> 00:38.125
Capare!

00:38.168 --> 00:39.952
Using dangerous,
mysterious magic.

00:39.996 --> 00:42.085
You'll be okay. Because every
version of your death --

00:42.129 --> 00:44.740
your real, permanent death --
Sam's the one who kills you.

00:46.481 --> 00:48.570
Ketch?

00:50.615 --> 00:55.098
The warding that surrounds us
is indeed beginning to falter.

00:55.142 --> 00:58.058
I say we find
the most vulnerable point,

00:58.101 --> 01:00.799
mass our power,
and break through now.

01:00.843 --> 01:02.453
Belphegor: Soon,
they're gonna overrun us.

01:02.497 --> 01:05.021
My little toy isn't strong
enough to handle all this.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.544
We have to find
another way.

01:06.588 --> 01:08.807
Alright, then
that's what we'll do.

01:22.386 --> 01:25.346
Just me, or are these ghost hits
coming faster?

01:25.389 --> 01:26.434
It's not just you.

01:41.188 --> 01:43.233
Alright, this way.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.323
What's the word
from the outside?

01:46.367 --> 01:48.760
Ghosts are still at it, trying
to break down the barrier.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.067
I left some Hunters at the gym
to keep the peace.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.677
The rest are set up around
the perimeter, in case --

01:52.721 --> 01:54.157
In case the spell breaks

01:54.201 --> 01:57.029
and a hundred billion ghosts
come busting out.

01:57.073 --> 01:59.249
This better work.It will work.

01:59.293 --> 02:00.859
The "Rafforza l'incantesimo"

02:00.903 --> 02:03.340
is a potent
transubstantiation spell.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.168
It can turn gossamer
into concrete.

02:05.212 --> 02:07.388
Like I said, get me close
to the epicenter,

02:07.431 --> 02:09.868
find me a nice,
protected ghost-free space --

02:09.912 --> 02:11.305
I'll patch those crumbling walls
right up,

02:11.348 --> 02:13.829
and we'll all be home in time
for high tea.

02:42.292 --> 02:43.685
Ah. Great.

02:43.728 --> 02:46.688
A nice, protected space.

02:48.646 --> 02:51.214
Ugh.

03:38.392 --> 03:42.439
Prendi cio che Ã¨ debole,
rendilo forte.

03:42.483 --> 03:45.486
D'una piuma d'oca,
fai una spada.

03:45.529 --> 03:48.315
D'una piuma d'oca,
fai una spada.

03:48.358 --> 03:53.058
D'una piuma d'oca,
fai una spada.

03:53.102 --> 03:55.452
Dalla nebbia, cemento --

04:00.544 --> 04:03.068
Dalla nebbia, cemento possente, impenetrabile, inflessibile.

04:03.112 --> 04:06.681
Looks like it's working.

04:13.557 --> 04:15.646
Rendilo forte.

04:15.690 --> 04:18.475
Rendilo forte!

04:21.826 --> 04:23.959
Rendilo forte.

04:25.656 --> 04:27.658
Rendilo forte!

04:34.970 --> 04:37.407
Rowena?

04:37.451 --> 04:39.540
We're all going to die.

04:56.470 --> 04:57.384
Drink.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.473
Of course.

04:59.516 --> 05:01.083
Dean.

05:02.867 --> 05:05.305
A real drink.

05:08.917 --> 05:10.353
Right.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.363
Belphegor:
Okay, now that we're waiting

05:20.407 --> 05:21.973
for the witch's hooch
to kick in,

05:22.017 --> 05:24.106
can we finally
admit the obvious?

05:24.149 --> 05:27.109
Uh, she failed.

05:27.152 --> 05:29.024
So if we're keeping score,
that's, uh,

05:29.067 --> 05:31.983
1 for the demon,
uh, 0 for the witch.

05:32.027 --> 05:35.683
The enchantment couldn't work.
No magic could.

05:35.726 --> 05:38.512
The spell put me into a --
a communion with the wall.

05:38.555 --> 05:42.820
I -- I could feel how weak
it is, how close to collapse --

05:42.864 --> 05:45.257
and I could feel why.

05:46.215 --> 05:48.217
I could feel them.
All of them.

05:48.260 --> 05:49.610
All of them?
Them who?

05:49.653 --> 05:52.700
The spirits -- their anger
and their hatred,

05:52.743 --> 05:54.397
writhing and raging.

05:54.441 --> 05:57.444
They're pressed up against those
walls breaking them down.

05:57.487 --> 05:58.662
There are too many,

05:58.706 --> 06:01.796
and they're too wild
and desperate and angry.

06:04.451 --> 06:07.628
Together,
they are too strong.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.456
Those walls will fall,

06:09.499 --> 06:12.110
and there's no magic on Earth
can stop it.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.593
How long do we have?

06:16.637 --> 06:18.465
Hours.
If we're lucky.

06:18.508 --> 06:21.119
Then we get out there,

06:21.163 --> 06:22.991
and we take out as many
as we possibly can

06:23.034 --> 06:24.471
before those walls fall.

06:24.514 --> 06:27.430
Rowena, mix up some of
those crystals you got.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.650
It wouldn't matter!

06:29.693 --> 06:31.347
Those things --
it would be like

06:31.391 --> 06:33.001
tossing mousetraps
at the Great Plague.

06:33.044 --> 06:35.046
I'm telling you --
it's over!

06:42.967 --> 06:44.578
Perhaps if
I'd gotten here sooner,

06:44.621 --> 06:46.449
there are any number of spells
I could've tried

06:46.493 --> 06:49.931
to close the gate to Hell
before it got to this point.

06:49.974 --> 06:53.108
But now it's too late.

06:54.805 --> 06:57.504
The cat's out
the bloody bag.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.551
Where the hell you going?

07:01.595 --> 07:03.858
Hey! Wh--

07:03.901 --> 07:05.729
I got him.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.731
We're not just gonna
give up.

07:07.775 --> 07:09.254
That's not who we are.

07:09.298 --> 07:10.952
Let's go out there
and let's take care of --

07:18.655 --> 07:19.613
Rowena.

07:19.656 --> 07:20.875
Hey.

07:20.918 --> 07:22.833
You okay?

07:22.877 --> 07:25.270
You need anything?

07:27.534 --> 07:29.666
A moment.

07:29.710 --> 07:32.016
Of course. Sure.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.627
Castiel: So, that's it?
You're just leaving?

07:33.670 --> 07:35.367
Belphegor: Oh, like you'd mind
if I did.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.369
You can't even
look at me.

07:37.413 --> 07:42.200
Well, sorry to disappoint,
but, uh...not leaving.

07:42.244 --> 07:44.202
I was looking...

07:44.246 --> 07:45.552
for that.

07:49.556 --> 07:51.166
Where it all began.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.532
Hey.

08:13.101 --> 08:14.102
What are you doing?

08:14.145 --> 08:15.582
I'm not gonna give up.

08:15.625 --> 08:16.626
That's what I'm doing.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.149
Not just gonna
sit in this crypt

08:18.193 --> 08:20.108
and wait for the walls
to come down.

08:20.151 --> 08:21.936
-You heard Rowena.
-Yeah, I heard her, okay?

08:21.979 --> 08:23.328
Dean:
Ghosts are gonna bust out,

08:23.372 --> 08:25.026
and they're gonna
swallow this world.

08:25.069 --> 08:26.593
And you want to what,
just relax?

08:26.636 --> 08:28.116
Take a knee?
No.

08:28.159 --> 08:30.858
No, we were gonna end this, Sam.
Like you said.

08:30.901 --> 08:32.468
We're gonna be free.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.078
I know, Dean, I-I just...

08:38.561 --> 08:40.563
This feels
bigger than us.

08:40.607 --> 08:44.001
You know? And --
And I'm out of ideas, and...

08:44.045 --> 08:45.742
And I'm freaked, too.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.527
Oh, I'm not freaked.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.877
I'm angry, okay?
I'm pissed.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.183
At God.
Yes.

08:52.227 --> 08:53.750
Me too.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.186
I mean, this whole mess,
you know?

08:55.230 --> 08:58.233
Th-This -- This sloppy-ass
ghostpocalypse --

08:58.276 --> 08:59.582
that's Chuck's ending?

08:59.626 --> 09:00.844
No.
No, I don't think so.

09:00.888 --> 09:02.672
After everything
that he has put us through?

09:02.716 --> 09:05.327
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let
some glorified fanboy

09:05.370 --> 09:07.111
get the last word.

09:11.725 --> 09:12.726
Right.

09:18.035 --> 09:19.863
Hey.

09:19.907 --> 09:21.952
Anything useful
in there?

09:25.739 --> 09:26.740
Not a thing.

09:36.706 --> 09:37.968
Belphegor: I don't care
what the witch calls it.

09:38.012 --> 09:40.667
It's not a door or a gate.

09:40.710 --> 09:41.711
What is it?

09:41.755 --> 09:42.973
It's a tear.

09:43.017 --> 09:45.149
God stamped his foot,
and...

09:45.193 --> 09:47.674
Hell ripped open.

09:47.717 --> 09:50.024
Belphegor...

09:50.067 --> 09:52.592
why were you
looking for this?

09:57.031 --> 09:59.033
That's the longest you've ever
looked me in the eyes.

09:59.076 --> 10:01.731
You don't have eyes.True.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.690
Okay.

10:03.733 --> 10:07.607
I got an idea, but, uh...
you're not gonna like it.

10:08.825 --> 10:11.132
Sam: Wait, what do you mean,
"Lilith's Crook"?

10:11.175 --> 10:12.568
Yeah, you know,
one of those, uh,

10:12.612 --> 10:15.136
curvy-ended canes
that shepherds use?

10:16.398 --> 10:19.183
Little Bo Peep?

10:19.227 --> 10:20.750
It's just a nickname.
Doesn't matter.

10:20.794 --> 10:22.404
Thing's actually
more of a horn.

10:22.447 --> 10:26.277
Anyways, when Lilith began
sending demons

10:26.321 --> 10:27.931
off to Earth
to do her bidding,

10:27.975 --> 10:29.585
there was
a little problem.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.370
I mean, yeah, she commanded
absolute loyalty in Hell,

10:32.414 --> 10:36.636
but there was no guarantee that
once her minions were topside,

10:36.679 --> 10:38.681
that they wouldn't just take
advantage of the situation.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.814
She needed to
control her flock.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.119
So --

10:42.163 --> 10:45.514
So she forged the Crook.Slash horn.

10:45.557 --> 10:49.779
It could -- can retrieve
all of Hell's lost creatures

10:49.823 --> 10:52.782
and bring them
straight back home.

10:54.392 --> 10:55.872
And why haven't we heard
about this before?

10:55.916 --> 10:57.352
Belphegor:
She never needed to use it.

10:57.395 --> 10:58.919
When she ruled,

10:58.962 --> 11:01.573
it was enough for us
that we knew she could.

11:01.617 --> 11:03.184
And then
when Crowley took over,

11:03.227 --> 11:04.576
he had other forms
of discipline --

11:04.620 --> 11:06.100
endless lines,
endless paperwork.

11:06.143 --> 11:08.145
Now that he liked to spend
a lot of time down there,

11:08.189 --> 11:09.756
anyway, with us.Where is it?

11:09.799 --> 11:12.933
Last I heard,
it was in Lilith's chamber,

11:12.976 --> 11:14.804
which has been sealed
for ages.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.501
Now that all the doors in Hell
are open --

11:16.545 --> 11:18.852
It's just sitting there,
ripe for the taking.

11:20.549 --> 11:22.856
I get the Crook,
sound the Crook,

11:22.899 --> 11:26.816
and we suck all Hell's ghosts
back into Hell.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.165
Then if the witch
is feeling up to it...

11:28.209 --> 11:30.472
I slam the door shut
behind them.

11:30.515 --> 11:31.778
Wait a second. How?

11:31.821 --> 11:34.737
With magic from
the Book of the Damned?

11:34.781 --> 11:36.739
A spell of
my own devising.

11:39.742 --> 11:42.789
The Sanetur Acre Vulnus.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.750
A healing spell
of a kind.

11:47.794 --> 11:50.013
If this gateway to Hell
isn't a gate at all,

11:50.057 --> 11:51.711
but a wound, a rupture,

11:51.754 --> 11:54.975
I can use the spell
to undo the damage Chuck did,

11:55.018 --> 11:57.978
and the hole will heal,
close itself up.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.719
We'll have to
time it perfectly.

11:59.762 --> 12:02.243
If -- If you're in Hell
when all this goes down,

12:02.286 --> 12:03.940
how will we know
when to start?

12:03.984 --> 12:06.769
Trust me.
You'll know.

12:08.379 --> 12:09.641
What are you gonna need?

12:09.685 --> 12:12.253
A-A few ingredients,
nothing too exotic --

12:12.296 --> 12:15.778
lavender, myrrh,
the skull of an owl,

12:15.822 --> 12:18.781
quiet
to perform the spell,

12:18.825 --> 12:20.827
and an assistant.

12:23.177 --> 12:25.135
Dibs on Samuel.

12:25.179 --> 12:26.833
Er, what?

12:26.876 --> 12:29.487
You're as close to a seasoned
witch as we've got in this lot.

12:30.924 --> 12:32.839
And I'll need someone
out there by the rupture.

12:32.882 --> 12:34.188
Why?

12:34.231 --> 12:36.668
I need to do the spell
in the safety of the crypt,

12:36.712 --> 12:38.453
but we need someone
close to the edge

12:38.496 --> 12:40.803
to serve as a fulcrum,
a carrier.

12:44.067 --> 12:48.028
Well, to put it in, uh,
American action movie terms,

12:48.071 --> 12:50.857
they'll be carrying a bomb,
I light the fuse,

12:50.900 --> 12:53.773
they toss it in -- boom.

12:55.687 --> 12:59.213
Whoever does this,
they'll be unprotected.

12:59.256 --> 13:00.997
No salt circles --

13:01.041 --> 13:04.784
all manner of angry spirits
right up in their grill.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.961
Sounds like fun.

13:08.004 --> 13:10.050
Yes, Belphegor?

13:10.093 --> 13:12.400
Uh,
who's coming with me?

13:13.575 --> 13:15.795
I'm sorry, but I'm not
going down to Hell

13:15.838 --> 13:18.798
and getting past all those
pissed off ghosts and demons

13:18.841 --> 13:20.364
that are maybe
loitering down there,

13:20.408 --> 13:23.063
and sounding the Crook
all by myself.

13:23.106 --> 13:24.499
So you want company?

13:24.542 --> 13:26.109
I want protection.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.633
Muscle.

13:28.677 --> 13:31.158
Yeah, Cass'll go.

13:31.201 --> 13:32.942
You've been to Hell
before.

13:37.729 --> 13:40.080
Well, it sounds like
I don't have a choice.

13:40.123 --> 13:43.561
Good. Great.
Go team.

13:54.137 --> 13:55.922
Nurse: Mr. Blackmore?

13:55.965 --> 13:58.185
You're awake.

13:58.228 --> 14:01.014
Mr. Bl--

14:03.103 --> 14:04.931
Ah, yes, yes.

14:04.974 --> 14:06.149
They took the bullets out.

14:07.672 --> 14:09.065
Folks who dropped you off
claimed you were

14:09.109 --> 14:11.546
injured in a...
hunting accident?

14:11.589 --> 14:13.896
Yes. One -- One --
One could call it that.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.159
Right.

14:16.203 --> 14:18.074
Where do you think
you're going?

14:18.118 --> 14:21.077
Off and away.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.688
Well, y-you can't.
You're in observation.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.081
A-A resident
needs to clear you.

14:25.125 --> 14:28.824
Yes, well, I'm sorry, my dear --
there's no time.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.696
I have, um, friends
who need my help.

14:31.740 --> 14:32.959
Uh, sir --

14:33.002 --> 14:34.917
Thank God.
Dr. Clark, I --

14:39.617 --> 14:42.098
Hello, Arthur.

14:42.142 --> 14:43.578
Ardat.

15:06.514 --> 15:08.690
You had one job.

15:08.733 --> 15:10.910
Find Belphegor.

15:12.999 --> 15:13.782
Aah!

15:15.740 --> 15:17.960
And I think you know
where he is.

15:19.962 --> 15:23.052
I assure you,
I haven't the foggiest.

15:23.096 --> 15:25.185
Such valor --
and for what?

15:25.228 --> 15:27.361
One profoundly
irritating demon?

15:29.363 --> 15:30.799
No.

15:30.842 --> 15:33.236
I think you're
protecting others.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.196
Humans.

15:36.239 --> 15:38.502
Your friends.

15:39.808 --> 15:40.983
And you won't
give them up?

15:41.027 --> 15:43.116
Not for any price?

15:47.598 --> 15:50.297
Not at any price.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.496
Belphegor:
You got a plan for after?

16:15.539 --> 16:18.760
Getting topside?

16:18.803 --> 16:20.066
Witch's spell goes right,

16:20.109 --> 16:23.069
the abyss will be
sealing up quick.

16:23.112 --> 16:26.028
I'll figure
something out.

16:26.072 --> 16:30.076
You know, your part in all this
is, uh, pretty dangerous.

16:30.119 --> 16:33.427
I mean, you could die,
get trapped in Hell.

16:33.470 --> 16:35.516
Your friends might
never see you again.

16:35.559 --> 16:38.562
Funny, 'cause, uh,

16:38.606 --> 16:40.564
they didn't seem to
think twice about it.

16:44.699 --> 16:46.309
Come on.

16:46.353 --> 16:49.443
It's more fun
when you fight back.

16:49.486 --> 16:50.748
How do we
get down there?

16:50.792 --> 16:52.794
Eh, I don't know.

16:52.837 --> 16:55.231
I didn't see any stairs
or anything,

16:55.275 --> 16:57.190
so I just figure that we --

17:09.202 --> 17:12.379
Salt, a couple guns from
the back of the Impala.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.859
And for the ginger...
witch stuff.

17:17.297 --> 17:20.213
Forget something?

17:20.256 --> 17:21.779
Right.

17:21.823 --> 17:23.303
One owl skull.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.261
R.I.P., Hedwig.

17:25.305 --> 17:26.349
You're welcome.

17:26.393 --> 17:29.439
Alright, so,
how bad is it out there?

17:29.483 --> 17:32.268
People are pretty restless,
but we're keeping a lid on.

17:32.312 --> 17:34.227
Getting here through
the quarantine zones,

17:34.270 --> 17:36.446
I stuck to the corners,
only got attacked a few times.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.753
I think most of the ghosts are
at the edge of town

17:38.796 --> 17:40.798
working to bring down
those walls.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.583
So what are you planning
in here?

17:42.626 --> 17:44.454
Another long-shot,
magical Hail Mary?

17:44.498 --> 17:48.241
Yeah. Yeah, except this time,
hopefully, it works.

17:48.284 --> 17:50.286
So we need you
and the other Hunters armed up

17:50.330 --> 17:51.940
and ready on the other side
of that wall.

17:51.983 --> 17:54.160
'Cause if this goes sideways,
you'll be the only thing

17:54.203 --> 17:57.380
standing between those ghosts
and the world.

17:57.424 --> 17:59.078
No pressure, right?

18:04.692 --> 18:06.868
Ketch.

18:06.911 --> 18:08.217
Says he's ready
to get back in the game.

18:37.377 --> 18:39.335
It's awfully quiet
down here.

18:39.379 --> 18:42.251
Yeah. Too quiet.

18:43.339 --> 18:45.689
Sorry, I thought
we were doing a bit.

18:47.256 --> 18:50.477
Guess everyone took their shot
and got out.

18:50.520 --> 18:55.177
Told you, I'm an oddball --
I actually like it here.

18:55.221 --> 18:59.225
You knew
Hell was nearly empty.

19:01.009 --> 19:04.230
Yet you needed protection,
"muscle," for this?

19:04.273 --> 19:06.580
Okay, you got me.
I wanted company.

19:06.623 --> 19:08.234
I wanted yourcompany.

19:08.277 --> 19:11.193
What? Shouldn't we at least
try and be friends?

19:11.237 --> 19:13.587
Sam and Dean, they seem to be
coming around.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.763
I think I'm, uh,
growing on them.

19:15.806 --> 19:17.504
You know,
like a cancer.

19:17.547 --> 19:20.202
You are not
growing on anyone.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.987
Sam and Dean
are just using you.

19:23.031 --> 19:26.077
Don't mistake that
for caring about you,

19:26.121 --> 19:28.428
because I can assure you
they don't.

19:28.471 --> 19:32.475
Wow.
You learn that the hard way?

19:32.519 --> 19:33.955
What is it, Cass,
really?

19:33.998 --> 19:37.872
This, uh,
seething animosity.

19:40.091 --> 19:41.963
You're wearing Jack,

19:42.006 --> 19:44.270
who was like a son to me,
like a coat.

19:44.313 --> 19:48.361
Every second in your presence
is intolerable.

19:48.404 --> 19:49.884
It's an abomination.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.755
You'rean abomination.

19:51.799 --> 19:55.585
Is this it?

19:55.629 --> 19:57.457
Yep.

20:35.451 --> 20:36.844
Malfayan?

20:39.803 --> 20:41.501
Bel?

20:41.544 --> 20:43.285
Hey!

20:43.329 --> 20:44.852
Uh,
what are you doing?

20:44.895 --> 20:47.246
What?
Not like Lilith's coming back.

20:48.029 --> 20:50.771
Whoa, easy, man!
Easy!

20:50.814 --> 20:52.729
What, are you working with
angels now?

20:52.773 --> 20:54.383
Yeah,
he's a little on edge.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.516
Does he have the horn?

20:56.559 --> 20:58.822
No.
But, uh -- Ooh!

20:58.866 --> 21:01.477
Dude.
Is that the Haxon Ring?

21:01.521 --> 21:03.349
Yeah.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.481
It's pretty sweet, eh?
I mean, it's a bit --

21:09.398 --> 21:10.617
Really?

21:10.660 --> 21:12.532
We came for one thing,
and one thing only.

21:12.575 --> 21:14.273
Right.

21:16.362 --> 21:17.493
I don't think
your friend

21:17.537 --> 21:20.366
was the first demon
to loot the place.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.542
Eh, guess not.

21:22.585 --> 21:26.676
Good thing what we're after...
is right here.

21:29.723 --> 21:31.942
I don't see a latch.

21:31.986 --> 21:33.379
What do you think
of these markings?

21:33.422 --> 21:35.946
It's Enochian.

21:37.034 --> 21:38.514
"Oh-ah-kuh-ree-me

21:38.558 --> 21:43.563
ah-tay-loh-kuh-vah-veem
noh-ruh."

21:43.606 --> 21:46.696
It's a song of praise.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.916
To Lucifer.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.570
They're verses.

21:50.613 --> 21:52.006
It's, uh...

21:52.049 --> 21:54.487
It's an incantation
to open the box.

21:54.530 --> 21:56.227
Smart.

21:56.271 --> 21:58.882
Lilith knew she was the only one
down here who could read it.

22:00.275 --> 22:01.407
Good thing
I brought you!

22:06.368 --> 22:08.544
Fine.

22:11.199 --> 22:15.638
Oh-rah-moh-tay-da-ah-boh-da
tay-da-ba.

22:15.682 --> 22:21.949
Va-veem-noh-ruh lahp tee-ah
toh-ruht-sool ohl-ah-oh.

22:21.992 --> 22:29.565
Toh-luh-ah ay-kuh-ree-me juh-uhz-hay oh-ruh-suh ee-yahd.

22:29.609 --> 22:35.571
Ah ee-yahd day
toh-luh-hah-mee.

22:40.097 --> 22:41.621
It's not working.

22:41.664 --> 22:44.014
Yeah.

22:44.058 --> 22:46.800
You know, uh,
they're verses, Cass.

22:46.843 --> 22:49.324
I think
they need to be sung.

23:02.555 --> 23:03.904
âª Toh-luh dah...âª

23:20.573 --> 23:22.618
Where you at, Ketch?

23:22.662 --> 23:25.012
Eyes on the page.

23:25.055 --> 23:27.580
I need you off book
for this incantation.

23:27.623 --> 23:31.279
Yeah, sorry. I just feel like
I should be out there fighting.

23:31.322 --> 23:33.237
And magic
isn't fighting?

23:33.281 --> 23:35.718
Dean's doing his part.

23:35.762 --> 23:38.765
It's time for you
to do yours.

23:38.808 --> 23:41.376
The plan.

23:42.595 --> 23:44.684
Of course, right.

23:44.727 --> 23:46.555
Our one shot.

23:46.599 --> 23:48.470
Read.

24:00.134 --> 24:02.005
Come on, come on,
let's go.

24:02.049 --> 24:03.485
âª ...meeâª

24:06.619 --> 24:09.883
Oh, Cass, your voice --
it's like, uh...

24:09.926 --> 24:11.014
like an angel.

24:11.058 --> 24:13.408
Shut up.
Guess it's go time.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.628
You're gonna need a head start
getting out of here.

24:35.691 --> 24:38.041
Oh. Hey. Ardat.

24:38.085 --> 24:39.086
How'd you find me?

24:39.129 --> 24:40.957
I got a hot tip.

24:41.001 --> 24:44.221
A very hot,
very British tip.

24:44.265 --> 24:46.093
I knew the second
those doors flew open

24:46.136 --> 24:48.182
that you'd be looking
for a way to take power.

24:53.709 --> 24:54.754
Lilith's Crook?

24:54.797 --> 24:56.016
A solid play.

24:56.059 --> 24:57.234
But you on the throne?

24:57.278 --> 24:59.759
Never. Going.
To. Happen.

25:07.636 --> 25:08.594
The horn!

25:08.637 --> 25:10.857
You know
he wants to rule Hell.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.902
It's all
he's ever wanted.

25:20.997 --> 25:22.608
I've been watching him
for centuries,

25:22.651 --> 25:25.567
bowing and scraping to Lilith
and Crowley, all of them.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.569
Just waiting for his chance
at the throne.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.136
And now you're gonna
give it to him?

25:29.179 --> 25:31.921
Do you have any idea
what he is?

25:38.493 --> 25:40.234
Wow.

25:40.277 --> 25:43.019
Blah, blah, blah --
she always was a talker.

25:43.063 --> 25:44.717
Is it true?

25:46.066 --> 25:48.111
You should go, Cass.

25:49.199 --> 25:50.723
Is it true?

25:50.766 --> 25:53.377
No!

25:53.421 --> 25:55.641
Okay, look,
I don't want to rule Hell.

25:55.684 --> 25:58.165
Then what do you want?

26:00.341 --> 26:02.125
You should go.

26:07.130 --> 26:09.611
What do I want?
I got what I want.

26:09.655 --> 26:13.789
This thing, it isn't just
a leash -- it's a siphon.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.312
What does that mean?

26:15.356 --> 26:19.534
It means that all the ghosts
and all the demons --

26:19.578 --> 26:22.363
I'm gonna suck them all
right back into me.

26:22.406 --> 26:25.192
The power of
a kajillion souls.

26:25.235 --> 26:28.674
Lilith, Crowley --
they are nothing.

26:29.718 --> 26:31.633
I'll be a god.

26:31.677 --> 26:34.157
Or, you know,
close enough.

26:34.201 --> 26:35.463
Great timing, right?

26:35.506 --> 26:37.813
'Cause, uh,
heard there was a vacancy.

26:40.860 --> 26:43.689
So the chest,
the Enochian --

26:43.732 --> 26:47.736
you've been playing us
all along.

26:47.780 --> 26:49.782
I couldn't have
done it without you.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.014
It's time, Sam.

27:22.423 --> 27:25.339
Both: Mundus fractus est.

27:25.382 --> 27:28.211
Sanetur acre vulnus.

27:28.255 --> 27:34.870
Adveniant harena atque saxum,
sursum, et deorsum.

27:45.011 --> 27:48.579
Sam.

27:48.623 --> 27:52.714
Claudatur porta
inter orbes terrarum...

27:58.981 --> 28:00.940
...nobis et illis.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.814
Rowena,
what happened?

28:48.857 --> 28:49.945
What the hell?

28:54.428 --> 28:57.039
Did it work?

28:57.083 --> 29:00.913
Rowena?

29:05.831 --> 29:07.006
Cass!

29:07.049 --> 29:09.008
Stop.

29:09.051 --> 29:11.532
Please.

29:11.575 --> 29:14.665
It's me -- Jack.

29:14.709 --> 29:17.364
Liar.

30:14.116 --> 30:15.291
Sam?

30:15.335 --> 30:16.466
Hey.

30:16.510 --> 30:17.511
What's going on?

30:17.554 --> 30:19.034
Are the ghosts gone?

30:19.078 --> 30:20.253
Hell if I know.

30:20.296 --> 30:22.429
But the crack's starting
to close up.

30:22.472 --> 30:24.474
Something doesn't
feel right.

30:24.518 --> 30:27.477
Fine, just --
don't --

30:35.877 --> 30:37.313
Rowena?

30:37.357 --> 30:40.142
What are you doing?

30:52.938 --> 30:55.897
My last
resurrection sachet.

30:57.986 --> 31:00.684
Won't need that
where I'm going.

31:00.728 --> 31:03.992
Where y-- Where you're "going"?
What are you talking about?

31:04.036 --> 31:05.907
Lilith's Crook,

31:05.951 --> 31:08.083
Belphegor sucking the souls
into Hell --

31:08.127 --> 31:10.216
that was your only shot.

31:10.259 --> 31:11.913
It wasn't mine.

31:11.957 --> 31:15.090
Magic can do anything,
Samuel,

31:15.134 --> 31:17.049
can contain anything --

31:17.092 --> 31:19.790
even the vast multitudes
of Hell.

31:19.834 --> 31:22.576
Contain?
What do you mean, "contain"?

31:22.619 --> 31:26.058
I can soak them up for a time
if I pay the price.

31:30.801 --> 31:33.239
"Death Is
an Infinite Vessel."

31:33.282 --> 31:38.026
A spell so simple it draws
its power from its caster.

31:39.549 --> 31:40.986
Just two ingredients.

31:41.029 --> 31:42.770
And you have them here?

31:42.813 --> 31:43.814
Aye.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.599
Rowena,
why didn't you tell us?

31:45.642 --> 31:48.645
Because, dear,
the first ingredient

31:48.689 --> 31:51.126
is my own
still-coursing blood.

31:51.170 --> 31:55.914
And the last
is my final breath.

31:55.957 --> 31:57.437
What?

31:57.480 --> 32:01.310
I'll absorb the ghosts and
demons and return them to Hell.

32:01.354 --> 32:04.052
In time,
my body'll break down,

32:04.096 --> 32:07.142
and they'll be released
right where they belong.

32:07.186 --> 32:11.103
No, no. No.
Rowena...no.

32:11.146 --> 32:13.018
Yes, Samuel.

32:13.061 --> 32:16.021
To perform this spell,
I have to die.

32:16.064 --> 32:20.155
And it has to be you
that kills me.

32:25.204 --> 32:28.120
Castiel: Dean.

32:30.557 --> 32:34.169
Cass!

32:34.213 --> 32:35.692
What the hell happened?

32:37.042 --> 32:39.653
No.
It has to be you.

32:39.696 --> 32:43.396
My real, permanent demise
is at your hands.

32:43.439 --> 32:45.180
It's in Death's books.

32:45.224 --> 32:47.574
Yeah, well, you know what?
Screw the books.

32:48.836 --> 32:51.230
I can't do this myself,
Sam.

32:51.273 --> 32:53.884
I can't.

32:53.928 --> 32:56.713
It has to be you
that kills me.

32:58.150 --> 32:59.194
Where's Belphegor?

32:59.238 --> 33:00.456
I killed him.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.284
You did what?

33:02.328 --> 33:04.634
Wh-What about the Crook?

33:04.678 --> 33:05.809
It's gone.

33:05.853 --> 33:07.986
It was destroyed.
What?!

33:08.812 --> 33:11.772
Hell's closing.
The walls are falling.

33:11.815 --> 33:14.383
There has to be
another way.

33:14.427 --> 33:16.646
I wish there were --
I do.

33:18.083 --> 33:22.217
I don't care about anything
enough to take my own life.

33:22.261 --> 33:25.699
Not you, your brother --
not even the world.

33:25.742 --> 33:27.657
But I believe in prophecy.

33:27.701 --> 33:29.311
I believe in magic.

33:29.355 --> 33:30.965
And I'm here,
and you're here,

33:31.009 --> 33:34.055
and everything we need to end
this right is in our hands.

33:40.496 --> 33:43.195
I know this in my bones --

33:43.238 --> 33:46.459
it has to be this way.

33:46.502 --> 33:49.157
Do it!
Kill me, Samuel!

33:58.210 --> 34:01.126
I know we've gotten quite fond
of each other, haven't we?

34:03.476 --> 34:06.218
But will you
let the world die,

34:06.261 --> 34:08.872
let your brother die,

34:08.916 --> 34:10.396
just so I can live?

34:15.270 --> 34:17.403
Cass,
this was our only shot.

34:17.446 --> 34:18.578
What the hell
were you thinking?

34:23.496 --> 34:24.758
No.

34:45.779 --> 34:47.259
That's my boy.

35:07.235 --> 35:09.281
Dean...

35:13.633 --> 35:15.243
Rowena?

35:53.629 --> 35:56.154
Goodbye, boys.

36:52.949 --> 36:54.299
Yeah.

36:57.519 --> 36:59.173
How you holding up?

37:05.701 --> 37:07.921
Any word from Stevie?

37:09.923 --> 37:11.490
Yeah,
I just talked to her.

37:11.533 --> 37:12.708
She says
the town's good.

37:12.752 --> 37:15.885
Well,
good as can be expected.

37:15.929 --> 37:17.974
Right. Good.

37:19.889 --> 37:21.630
They found Ketch.

37:21.674 --> 37:23.676
Dead.

37:23.719 --> 37:27.375
He -- What?

37:27.419 --> 37:29.377
How?

37:29.421 --> 37:31.423
Bad.

37:31.466 --> 37:32.337
Probably a demon.

37:39.909 --> 37:42.260
We did it,
though, man.

37:43.391 --> 37:45.480
It's over.

37:45.524 --> 37:49.571
God threw one last apocalypse
at us,

37:49.615 --> 37:52.008
and we beat it.

37:54.794 --> 37:56.361
Yeah.

37:59.625 --> 38:03.411
What you did...

38:03.455 --> 38:05.631
Rowena...

38:08.242 --> 38:09.939
You didn't have a choice.

38:16.555 --> 38:18.339
I know.

38:26.173 --> 38:28.306
Castiel: How's Sam?

38:35.400 --> 38:37.315
Not great.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.409
Sorry about Rowena.

38:44.452 --> 38:46.846
You're sorry?

38:48.326 --> 38:51.503
Why didn't you just
stick to the damn plan?

38:53.548 --> 38:54.549
Belphegor was lying.

38:54.593 --> 38:56.682
Belphegor's a demon.He was using us.

38:56.725 --> 38:58.597
He wanted to
eat every last soul

38:58.640 --> 39:00.207
to take over Hell, Earth,
and every--

39:00.250 --> 39:02.905
Yeah, and we would've
figured it out -- after.

39:02.949 --> 39:03.950
With Rowena.

39:03.993 --> 39:06.735
The plan changed, Dean.

39:06.779 --> 39:08.128
Something went wrong.

39:08.171 --> 39:09.608
You know this.
Something always goes wrong.

39:09.651 --> 39:12.306
Yeah, why does that something
always seem to be you?

39:22.272 --> 39:24.579
You used to trust me,

39:24.623 --> 39:27.234
give me the benefit
of the doubt.

39:27.277 --> 39:29.541
Now you can
barely look at me.

39:32.761 --> 39:34.502
My powers are failing,
and --

39:34.546 --> 39:38.419
and I've tried to talk to you,
over and over,

39:38.463 --> 39:39.725
and you just don't
want to hear it.

39:39.768 --> 39:41.901
You don't care.
I'm...

39:41.944 --> 39:43.729
dead to you.

39:43.772 --> 39:46.775
You still blame me
for Mary.

39:55.567 --> 39:58.526
Well, I don't think
there's anything left to say.

40:01.573 --> 40:03.618
Where you going?

40:07.709 --> 40:10.756
Jack's dead.

40:10.799 --> 40:13.933
Chuck's gone.

40:13.976 --> 40:16.588
You and Sam
have each other.

40:20.461 --> 40:23.638
I think it's time
for me to move on.
