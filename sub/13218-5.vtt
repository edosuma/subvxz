[inmates talking indistinctly]

01:21.626 --> 01:23.669
I've never seen it this long.

01:23.753 --> 01:26.088
This is worse than Disneyland.

01:26.172 --> 01:27.423
You've been to Disneyland?

01:27.507 --> 01:31.051
Uh, we go to this off-brand version
outside of Worcester.

01:31.969 --> 01:34.514
For years, I thought his name
was Milton Mouse.

01:35.515 --> 01:37.308
-That's fucked up.
-[laughs]

01:37.392 --> 01:40.019
And Snow White had a lot of mud
in her snow,

01:40.102 --> 01:41.312
if you know what I mean.

01:41.396 --> 01:43.648
What's that supposed to mean,
you're out of maxi pads?

01:43.731 --> 01:47.568
It means there's 100 new inmates,
but the same budget for inessentials.

01:48.403 --> 01:49.695
[scoffs] You hear that?

01:49.779 --> 01:53.158
My baby box is inessential.

01:53.241 --> 01:54.325
[inmate] No way.

01:54.409 --> 01:56.577
You can buy tampons at commissary.

01:58.621 --> 02:00.623
For ten bucks a box.

02:00.706 --> 02:03.376
We make ten cents an hour.

02:05.044 --> 02:08.339
Wait. What're we supposed to do?
Use toilet paper?

02:08.964 --> 02:12.760
I got enough tampons for this time,
if I only use one a day.

02:12.843 --> 02:15.012
[chuckles] Yeah, let me know
how that works out.

02:15.095 --> 02:17.348
One time, I ran outta tampons,

02:17.432 --> 02:21.519
so I used one of those, um,
dinosaur just-add-water sponges for kids.

02:21.602 --> 02:22.728
It was really fun.

02:22.812 --> 02:23.979
-[chuckles]
-'Cause it was like,

02:24.063 --> 02:26.274
"Ooh, I wonder what this will be?

02:26.357 --> 02:29.444
-Oh! Brontosaurus Rex!"
-[laughs] Surprise.

02:29.527 --> 02:32.655
-Covered in baby blood!
-There ain't no Brontosaurus Rex.

02:32.738 --> 02:36.367
-What?
-It's Brontosaurus. Period.

02:36.451 --> 02:38.744
Though now they're saying
it's Apatosaurus.

02:39.287 --> 02:41.206
My five-year-old's crazy for that shit.

02:41.289 --> 02:43.166
[inmate] Hello.
We are all in line here.

02:43.249 --> 02:44.834
-So, you need to get to the back--
-What're you--

02:44.917 --> 02:46.711
[Dixon] Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey!

02:46.794 --> 02:47.920
-[clamoring]
-[Dixon] Hey!

02:52.425 --> 02:54.344
[Dixon] Respect the fucking line.

02:55.386 --> 02:57.597
Just like fake Disneyland.

02:59.098 --> 03:01.100
[Linda] And then, you'll meet Jenny Stark.

03:01.183 --> 03:04.186
She's basically me, but at
Corrections Corporation and Management.

03:04.270 --> 03:06.689
[chuckles] One year,
we switched nametags,

03:06.772 --> 03:08.274
and for the entire panel discussion

03:08.358 --> 03:11.986
I was Jenny from CCM
and she was Linda from MCC.

03:12.069 --> 03:13.238
It was bananas.

03:13.321 --> 03:15.281
-[chuckles]
-You go every year?

03:15.365 --> 03:17.283
It's worth it for the swag alone.

03:17.367 --> 03:19.285
One year,
we got these little toy jail cells

03:19.369 --> 03:21.287
for you to put your candy in
when you're on a diet.

03:21.371 --> 03:22.622
-And then... Yeah.
-[both chuckle]

03:22.705 --> 03:24.957
Another year we got these
Nerf-style guard batons.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.835
And so, anytime anyone said
something stupid at a staff meeting,

03:27.918 --> 03:29.420
we would just whale on them.

03:30.004 --> 03:32.047
Until the incident
with Greg's eye, but...

03:32.131 --> 03:34.259
-[both chuckle]
-[phone ringing]

03:34.342 --> 03:35.968
Ah...

03:36.051 --> 03:39.054
-Shit! It's my assistant.
-Oh.

03:40.556 --> 03:41.974
What, Jefferson?

03:42.057 --> 03:44.394
Top of the morning to you, Mr. C...

03:44.477 --> 03:46.103
again.

03:46.186 --> 03:50.400
I forgot to ask if you wanted the files
done by last name or prisoner number.

03:50.483 --> 03:52.443
Last name. Listen, Jefferson,

03:52.527 --> 03:55.112
I'm gonna be in this conference
pretty much 24/7.

03:55.195 --> 03:56.489
It's very immersive.

03:56.572 --> 03:59.950
[stammers] I'm not gonna be able
to answer every little thing.

04:00.034 --> 04:03.120
Got it. I will hold down the fort
while you're gone.

04:03.203 --> 04:05.873
No. Do not hold anything down.

04:05.956 --> 04:08.668
I am not giving you power
over anything or anyone.

04:08.751 --> 04:11.170
<i>-All you are doing is files.</i>
-[sighs]

04:11.254 --> 04:13.088
You'll do those until I get back.

04:13.172 --> 04:15.883
And if by some miracle you finish
before I get back,

04:15.966 --> 04:17.677
sit... quietly.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.887
Copy that.

04:19.970 --> 04:21.639
That's a thing people say, right?

04:21.721 --> 04:22.765
No.

04:23.683 --> 04:25.393
-[dial tone]
-[scoffs]

04:25.476 --> 04:26.894
Assistants...

04:26.977 --> 04:29.855
they waste more time than they save.

04:29.939 --> 04:31.857
You'll get the hang of delegation.

04:31.941 --> 04:35.027
Just make sure that you fire them
every three months or so.

04:35.736 --> 04:36.904
Even if they're good?

04:36.987 --> 04:39.990
Especially if they're good.
I've been through 29.

04:40.074 --> 04:42.159
You don't want them getting too essential.

04:42.242 --> 04:44.454
I'm not sure that's the worry here.

04:44.537 --> 04:45.663
[chuckles]

05:06.058 --> 05:07.477
[snickers]

05:12.773 --> 05:14.191
[exhales sharply]

05:18.278 --> 05:20.155
[inmates speaking indistinctly]

05:21.240 --> 05:24.159
-How long has this been up?
-Only a few hours, sir.

05:25.077 --> 05:26.746
A few hours?

05:26.829 --> 05:28.331
Yeah, no. We're... [smacks lips]

05:28.414 --> 05:30.958
looking for the right shade of beige
to cover it up.

05:31.041 --> 05:32.668
You know, gotta match
the rest of the wall.

05:32.752 --> 05:33.836
We're not house flipping.

05:33.919 --> 05:35.630
The inmates see graffiti,

05:35.713 --> 05:39.049
they think it's okay to vandalize,
litter, destroy property.

05:39.133 --> 05:41.469
Oh, yeah,
the broken windows theory?

05:41.552 --> 05:43.679
Rudy Giuliani?
I mean, wasn't that disproven?

05:43.763 --> 05:46.181
That man is a hero,

05:46.265 --> 05:48.768
and history will acknowledge that.

05:48.851 --> 05:50.185
Okay.

05:50.269 --> 05:53.313
We're upping you to a pair a day,
because we know that you can handle it.

05:53.398 --> 05:54.815
You lost more girls, huh?

05:54.899 --> 05:56.316
Ah, trimming some of the fat is all.

05:56.401 --> 05:58.193
We can always find
new panty cattle.

05:58.277 --> 06:00.571
Your real problem is the Spanish.
They got momentum.

06:00.655 --> 06:02.532
-You got to deal--
-Shh!

06:05.535 --> 06:07.620
[Piscatella] ...now!
This is exactly the sort of thing

06:07.703 --> 06:11.081
that escalates to drugs,
and violence, and gangs.

06:12.291 --> 06:14.084
[inmate] Hey! Hey!

06:15.628 --> 06:16.962
Case in point.

06:17.046 --> 06:18.589
[Piscatella] Hey, hey!

06:18.673 --> 06:20.132
-[women grunting]
-Knock it off!

06:20.215 --> 06:22.051
[inmate] Oh! Bitch!

06:23.803 --> 06:26.263
Fuck these night shifts in the ass.

06:26.346 --> 06:28.641
-Aw, past your bedtime?
-Didn't say that.

06:28.724 --> 06:31.143
After-party at my place again, people.

06:31.226 --> 06:32.603
-Chez Humps!
-I'm there.

06:32.687 --> 06:35.648
-Me, three.
-Jesus, guys, it's 9:00 a.m.

06:36.148 --> 06:38.067
Yo, hook up Donuts here
with a Fallujah Omelet.

06:38.150 --> 06:39.318
Maybe that'll untwist his dick.

06:39.401 --> 06:41.779
-[chuckles]
-What's a Fallujah Omelet?

06:41.862 --> 06:44.114
-[chuckles]
-It's a JÃ¤ger shot and a raw egg.

06:44.198 --> 06:45.450
It's the breakfast of champions.

06:45.533 --> 06:47.117
[sighs] Yeah, I'm gonna pass.

06:47.201 --> 06:48.453
Come on, man.
It's pure protein.

06:48.536 --> 06:50.830
Yeah, I gotta stay and watch her. So...

06:50.913 --> 06:51.914
[Dixon] Oh, I see.

06:51.997 --> 06:54.041
You're gonna dip your donut
in Ramos here.

06:56.877 --> 06:59.421
Some people like their breakfast sweet,
not savory.

07:01.090 --> 07:03.509
You know what gets me so hot?

07:03.593 --> 07:05.595
Is when guys compare me to breakfast,

07:05.678 --> 07:07.972
and when they talk about me
like I'm not even here.

07:10.099 --> 07:13.143
How about you call me
"that oatmeal in the front seat"

07:13.227 --> 07:15.020
and I'll be so yours?

07:16.814 --> 07:18.774
Dude, she totally stepped on your balls.

07:18.858 --> 07:20.693
-[chuckling]
-Shut up, Blake.

07:20.776 --> 07:21.861
Shut the fuck up.

07:21.944 --> 07:23.320
[all chuckling]

07:26.240 --> 07:28.033
[dance music playing]

07:38.043 --> 07:39.962
[gasps] Pretty!

07:40.045 --> 07:42.089
-Happy Friday, ladies.
-[blows]

07:42.590 --> 07:44.467
I'll be back to check on you soon, okay?

08:11.786 --> 08:13.871
Be careful. Karma's a bitch.

08:13.954 --> 08:16.123
Who's Karma? That new girl?

08:31.221 --> 08:32.972
One more round
for the thirsty gentle--

08:33.057 --> 08:35.017
-[bottle shattering]
-You okay?

08:35.100 --> 08:36.644
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

08:36.727 --> 08:38.477
My boss is gonna kill me!

08:38.563 --> 08:40.606
[Bandar] Hey,
it's just potato juice, right?

08:40.690 --> 08:42.024
[Maritza] No, you don't understand.

08:42.692 --> 08:43.859
He'll take it out of my paycheck.

08:43.943 --> 08:46.862
And I have a little baby
to support, and my mom...

08:46.946 --> 08:49.532
[sobbing] she can't work
on account of oldness.

08:49.615 --> 08:51.534
-I'm sorry--
-Come on, don't cry.

08:51.617 --> 08:52.618
Okay.

08:52.702 --> 08:54.453
Dudes, don't waste it.

08:54.537 --> 08:56.288
Get off the floor, man.

08:56.371 --> 08:58.123
Like, ten kinds of AIDS down there.

08:58.791 --> 09:01.836
Don't cry.
We'll pitch in for it, right, guys?

09:06.131 --> 09:08.759
-Yeah, yeah. Sure, whatever.
-Sure.

09:10.469 --> 09:12.012
Here.

09:12.805 --> 09:14.181
[sniffling]

09:23.148 --> 09:25.192
What, you pull that shit every night?

09:26.151 --> 09:29.488
It's 300 bucks.
That's not bad for a janky-ass short con.

09:30.530 --> 09:31.824
I don't know what you're talking about.

09:31.907 --> 09:33.075
You know, your boss is a friend of mine.

09:33.158 --> 09:34.869
You want me to go stick his nose
in that puddle back there?

09:34.952 --> 09:36.078
No, please, don't tell him.

09:36.161 --> 09:37.663
You're not bad for an amateur.

09:37.747 --> 09:39.749
I mean, of course, the face helps.

09:40.540 --> 09:42.042
Please, I have a little baby.

09:42.126 --> 09:43.460
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-And if I let you see--

09:43.543 --> 09:45.630
We gotta get you off the pity angle.

09:45.713 --> 09:48.048
Go straight for the dick.

09:48.132 --> 09:49.341
It's the better play.

09:51.135 --> 09:55.097
So, come on,
what do you pull in a good year?

09:55.180 --> 09:56.306
Fifty thousand.

09:56.390 --> 09:58.433
What if I said you could
make that in an hour?

09:58.517 --> 10:01.395
Um, I'm not a prostitute.

10:01.478 --> 10:04.564
Not even if the guy is kinda hot
in a mean-dad way.

10:08.903 --> 10:10.445
What did you say your name was?

10:11.822 --> 10:15.367
Yessica.
It's like "Jessica," but ethnic.

10:15.450 --> 10:16.576
[chuckles]

10:16.661 --> 10:18.578
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

10:20.539 --> 10:22.917
Normally, I'm not an ear girl,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.878
but when Vinnie told me

10:25.961 --> 10:28.547
that he was putting
a tongue saber in there,

10:28.631 --> 10:31.258
and he said he was
swishing it around,

10:31.341 --> 10:33.678
my chair was like a wading pool.

10:33.761 --> 10:35.262
[both chuckle]

10:35.345 --> 10:36.931
I mean, don't get me wrong.

10:37.014 --> 10:39.725
The first time you have word-sex,
it's nice.

10:39.809 --> 10:43.103
-Mmm-hmm.
-But, it's just so much better

10:43.187 --> 10:45.815
when you really know somebody.

10:45.898 --> 10:47.733
So, you feel like
you really know him.

10:47.817 --> 10:49.526
Sure, I do.

10:51.528 --> 10:54.198
My mom always said
she knew my dad wanted sex

10:54.281 --> 10:57.117
when he didn't ask
for seconds at dinner. [snorts]

10:57.201 --> 11:00.705
And my dad said
he knew my mom wanted sex

11:00.788 --> 11:03.207
when she got me and my sister
Blockbuster videos.

11:03.290 --> 11:04.541
[snorts]

11:06.335 --> 11:08.796
I always wanted to know
someone that well.

11:10.672 --> 11:12.341
Yeah...

11:12.424 --> 11:13.843
me, too.

11:18.180 --> 11:21.558
So, your parents would
talk to you about sex?

11:21.641 --> 11:22.810
Mine would never.

11:22.893 --> 11:24.561
[chuckles] Oh, yeah.

11:24.644 --> 11:27.647
The birds, and the trees, and the bees...

11:27.732 --> 11:29.483
and the knees.

11:30.275 --> 11:33.153
[chuckles] I'm not sure
they told you that right.

11:35.489 --> 11:38.075
-[shrieks] Christ on a cracker!
-What is it?

11:39.493 --> 11:42.788
[sighs] The Shower Pooper strikes again.

11:42.872 --> 11:44.915
Ugh, this has happened before?

11:44.999 --> 11:46.583
Two or three times.

11:46.666 --> 11:48.919
How do you know it's the same person?

11:49.003 --> 11:52.464
-Heft, density, hue.
-[groans]

11:52.547 --> 11:54.800
It's as personal as a signature,
if you think about it.

11:54.884 --> 11:56.969
You know, that reminds me,

11:57.052 --> 12:00.305
there was this guy in my high school
who knew how to sign his name in--

12:00.389 --> 12:02.557
No, no, no, no, no,
please, Suzanne.

12:02.641 --> 12:04.601
It is too early for that.

12:04.684 --> 12:06.979
We need to catch this person
before she strikes again.

12:07.062 --> 12:09.648
I do not even know where to start.

12:09.731 --> 12:16.446
Oh, one starts by following every angle,
examining every clue.

12:16.530 --> 12:20.910
By seeing patterns of behavior
where no one else can see.

12:20.993 --> 12:22.953
Until finally...

12:23.037 --> 12:24.997
you catch the pooper

12:25.080 --> 12:30.002
in a trap of her own making.

12:30.085 --> 12:31.545
You mean...

12:32.754 --> 12:34.339
like detectives?

12:38.302 --> 12:40.470
[man on PA] <i>Now,</i>
<i>the keynote address by Kip Carnigan</i>

12:40.554 --> 12:42.722
<i>will begin at 3:00 p.m.</i>
<i>in the Laurel room.</i>

12:42.807 --> 12:45.893
<i>-No pre-registration...</i>
-All right, you two are all set.

12:45.976 --> 12:47.102
-[Linda] Thank you.
-Mmm.

12:47.186 --> 12:49.521
-[Caputo] Hey, thanks.
-Have fun in there.

12:50.564 --> 12:51.690
[Caputo chuckles]

12:54.568 --> 12:55.903
Whoa.

12:55.986 --> 12:57.612
What are these supposed to be for?

12:57.696 --> 12:59.239
Promotional purposes.

12:59.323 --> 13:00.908
[both chuckle]

13:13.753 --> 13:18.133
Our prize-winning system
can detect and pinpoint

13:18.217 --> 13:21.220
any cell phone
within a two-mile radius.

13:30.604 --> 13:31.939
[Russ] Linda.

13:32.982 --> 13:35.067
Saw you're on a panel,
you rock star.

13:35.150 --> 13:38.070
Oh, Russ. It's just a panel,
not a breakout session.

13:38.153 --> 13:40.239
Still. It's huge.

13:40.322 --> 13:41.991
So what's the hot booth this year?

13:42.074 --> 13:43.868
Laser guns.

13:43.951 --> 13:45.785
But the wait is epic.

13:45.870 --> 13:47.913
Catch you two on the other side.
[mimics gunshots]

13:47.997 --> 13:50.790
[woman] We at R and R Ministries
could not be more proud

13:50.875 --> 13:53.710
of our faith-based
rehabilitation program,

13:53.793 --> 13:56.046
utilizing New Testament stories

13:56.130 --> 14:00.217
to help inmates establish
a firm moral foundation.

14:00.300 --> 14:03.012
Oh, right. Because we should treat them
like Sunday schoolers,

14:03.095 --> 14:04.679
not dangerous criminals.

14:04.763 --> 14:07.724
Our fences are made from
a state-of-the-art titanium alloy,

14:07.807 --> 14:13.313
which is fireproof, plier-proof,
tamperproof, foolproof.

14:13.397 --> 14:15.607
-We could really use some of this stuff.
-Ooh.

14:15.690 --> 14:17.442
Not on MCC's budget.

14:19.486 --> 14:22.614
Think of this less as a shopping trip
and more of a brainstorming sesh.

14:22.697 --> 14:25.075
[beeping]

14:25.159 --> 14:26.535
I have enough of that in my life.

14:26.618 --> 14:29.371
[chuckles] It's just for fun, silly.
I think it's ice cream.

14:29.454 --> 14:32.707
It's time to enter
the 21st century, people.

14:32.791 --> 14:36.711
The old-fashioned maxi pad
can be a budget-killer.

14:36.795 --> 14:41.383
These durable, reusable
plastic menstruation capture cups

14:41.466 --> 14:45.220
are a one-time expenditure
for your women's facility.

14:46.221 --> 14:47.347
[Caputo] And this is safe?

14:47.431 --> 14:48.598
Missed me. [chuckles]

14:48.682 --> 14:50.809
Oh, it is 100% non-deadly.

14:50.893 --> 14:53.103
Right now,
the laser's on setting two,

14:53.187 --> 14:56.023
your basic sunburn-level discomfort.

14:56.106 --> 15:01.278
Dial that bad boy up to ten...
we're talking third-degree burns.

15:01.361 --> 15:03.989
<i>Andale, Andale!</i>
Speedy-- Ow!

15:04.073 --> 15:05.240
[crowd laughs]

15:05.324 --> 15:07.076
Just a little sting.

15:07.159 --> 15:08.827
Nothing I can't-- [yells]

15:08.911 --> 15:11.413
[crowd applauds]

15:12.831 --> 15:14.499
Nice shooting, Tex.

15:15.167 --> 15:16.376
[blows]

15:18.295 --> 15:19.838
[Kip Carnigan] Well, well.

15:19.922 --> 15:21.881
Wouldn't wanna run into you
in the prison yard.

15:21.966 --> 15:24.134
Kip Carnigan.

15:24.218 --> 15:26.470
They couldn't find anybody else
to give the keynote this year?

15:26.553 --> 15:27.637
Gandhi, maybe?

15:27.721 --> 15:30.390
Oh, I heard they approached him,
but his corpse was booked solid.

15:30.474 --> 15:31.475
-[chuckles]
-Who's your friend?

15:31.558 --> 15:33.893
This is Joe Caputo from Litchfield.

15:33.978 --> 15:35.812
He is the dark horse to be the next you.

15:37.606 --> 15:40.275
-Good luck with that.
-Thank you, future me.

15:42.069 --> 15:43.862
You're a lucky man.

15:43.946 --> 15:45.405
Oh, we're not...

15:45.489 --> 15:47.950
[sighs] Oh, my God, was that okay?

15:48.033 --> 15:50.077
Did I sound normal?
Was that like...

15:50.160 --> 15:52.454
Sure. What's the big deal?

15:52.537 --> 15:54.873
That's Kip Carnigan, he used to be
the warden over at Sitwell

15:54.957 --> 15:56.250
and now he is, like...

15:56.333 --> 15:58.502
the face of corrections in America.

15:59.544 --> 16:00.837
Oh, wow.

16:03.257 --> 16:05.467
[softly] Okay... warden.

16:13.642 --> 16:14.726
[sighs]

16:15.769 --> 16:17.521
[Piscatella] Jefferson.

16:17.604 --> 16:20.524
Who does the purchase orders
for maxi pads and so forth?

16:21.275 --> 16:23.193
Hmm. Uh...

16:23.277 --> 16:26.863
you might want to talk to
the VP of Purchasing for that.

16:26.946 --> 16:29.533
Linda... something.

16:29.616 --> 16:31.201
Are you supposed to be on that?

16:31.285 --> 16:34.788
Mr. Caputo wants me to make sure
all his files are in order.

16:42.921 --> 16:44.464
[sighs]

17:01.190 --> 17:03.900
[softly] Ooh!
That's what I'm talking about!

17:03.983 --> 17:05.277
[exhales deeply]

17:07.154 --> 17:09.114
[whispers] I'm the boss of this bitch!

17:10.365 --> 17:12.034
[inmates speaking indistinctly]

17:17.580 --> 17:19.040
Psst.

17:19.124 --> 17:20.375
[in Spanish] I swear,

17:20.459 --> 17:23.837
you get busted with that thing
and none of us ever met you.

17:23.920 --> 17:25.047
[in English] It's self-defense.

17:25.130 --> 17:27.006
That poi snorter stole our inventory.

17:27.090 --> 17:28.883
[in Spanish] Inventory's not the problem.

17:30.135 --> 17:33.012
We got two weeks of ripe fruit
ready to sell.

17:33.097 --> 17:37.309
And my stupid cousin Alonso
is gonna do the selling.

17:37.392 --> 17:40.104
[in English] Our problem is
getting everything out.

17:40.187 --> 17:42.231
I don't know how fucking Chapman does it.

17:43.273 --> 17:45.234
Probably, she uses her sexuality?

17:46.443 --> 17:48.903
Why can't we use our sexuality?

17:48.987 --> 17:49.988
'Cause we better than that.

17:50.072 --> 17:52.241
Can't we just throw 'em over the fence?
It ain't that high.

17:52.324 --> 17:54.743
They got guards up there
with guns and shit.

17:55.452 --> 17:58.122
Plus, people saying
they watching us with drones now.

17:58.205 --> 18:01.166
[in Spanish] What if we build
our own drone that works for us?

18:01.250 --> 18:03.668
[in English] Um... anybody else?

18:04.544 --> 18:07.547
Or we could dig a tunnel,
like we're El Chapo or in the movies.

18:07.631 --> 18:09.133
Guys, I got an idea.

18:09.216 --> 18:11.885
Or we could knock out a guard
and take his uniform, like in the movies.

18:11.968 --> 18:15.514
Okay, anybody got any non-movie,
non-El Chapo ideas?

18:15.597 --> 18:19.268
Maritza's got an idea,
or she's drying out her armpits.

18:19.351 --> 18:22.146
Seriously, guys?
I have a van.

18:28.818 --> 18:31.946
[Tavi] See, the hot girls stand out front
to draw people in.

18:32.030 --> 18:33.615
She's not that hot.

18:33.698 --> 18:35.325
[Chazz] You should put your
hair up like hers, Jessica.

18:35.409 --> 18:36.660
You have to blend in.

18:36.743 --> 18:40.205
Did you know a ponytail
is like a natural facelift?

18:41.456 --> 18:43.375
So, what's the first thing you do?

18:44.126 --> 18:45.794
-I find my mark.
-Good.

18:46.295 --> 18:47.712
Will his name be Mark?

18:49.214 --> 18:50.215
[sighs]

18:50.299 --> 18:51.383
Kidding!

18:54.553 --> 18:56.430
Pick a rich guy, obviously.

18:57.139 --> 18:58.557
Old and rich, if possible.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.850
You're looking for a guy who's too ugly
to have you as a girlfriend,

19:00.934 --> 19:01.976
if he didn't have any money.

19:02.060 --> 19:03.978
Aw, that's so sweet.

19:04.771 --> 19:06.606
Wait. Catch this.

19:07.524 --> 19:10.777
[Tavi] "Hmm. Hey, baby.
Do you come with the car?"

19:10.860 --> 19:13.530
"Tee-hee. I've totally never
heard that joke before."

19:13.613 --> 19:14.656
[chuckling]

19:14.739 --> 19:17.992
Whoa, she's giving him
the head toss.

19:18.076 --> 19:20.329
That's like two clicks away
from a blowie.

19:20.412 --> 19:21.538
[inaudible]

19:22.789 --> 19:25.250
"Ooh, your wallet looks so heavy."

19:25.334 --> 19:27.461
[Tavi] All right. So, now you have
your mark, what do you do next?

19:27.544 --> 19:30.129
[Maritza] Take his ID to the desk
and get the keys.

19:30.214 --> 19:32.757
[Tavi] Only now, instead
of Judy Salesgirl, you're Mrs. Mark,

19:32.841 --> 19:35.385
and you want to take a test drive
with your husband.

19:35.469 --> 19:38.972
You leave his ID, you take the keys
and you walk the mark to the car.

19:39.598 --> 19:42.684
If I forget to tell you guys later,
I'm having a really good time.

19:42.767 --> 19:44.894
[Tavi] All right. Now, you take your mark
on his test drive,

19:44.978 --> 19:47.189
drop him off in front
of the dealership after,

19:47.272 --> 19:50.024
and bam, you drive off into the sunset.
Any questions?

19:50.108 --> 19:53.903
What if the mark's name
happens to be Mark?

19:56.531 --> 19:58.533
Oh, my God! Kidding!

20:00.452 --> 20:02.036
[inmates talking indistinctly]

20:03.705 --> 20:04.748
[inhales deeply]

20:04.831 --> 20:07.209
Man, this shit better be on fleek
for ten bucks a box.

20:07.292 --> 20:09.794
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

20:09.878 --> 20:11.588
Hey, you mind loaning me
one of those?

20:13.215 --> 20:15.509
You gonna give it back after?
[laughs]

20:15.592 --> 20:18.387
Some of us can't afford to feel
the mountain mist.

20:18.470 --> 20:23.517
Well, you know, some of us is chosen
and some of us ain't.

20:23.600 --> 20:27.937
Like, first, we was chosen
by little white dude with the sneakers

20:28.021 --> 20:29.689
to sew panties for Whispers.

20:29.773 --> 20:32.901
Then, we was chosen by HaShem hisself

20:32.984 --> 20:36.405
to eat tasty broccoli
and keep his covenant.

20:37.489 --> 20:39.115
Hmm? Hmm, hmm?

20:39.198 --> 20:43.036
I know there's something in that covenant
about generosity.

20:45.079 --> 20:47.666
Oh, wait, wait, um,
it's coming to me now.

20:47.749 --> 20:50.752
"If there are poor among you,

20:50.835 --> 20:55.549
do not be selfish or greedy
towards them."

20:55.632 --> 20:57.717
Uh, I think that's a Christian thing.

20:59.093 --> 21:00.512
It's the same damn book.

21:01.846 --> 21:04.182
We just got different prophets is all.

21:04.683 --> 21:08.019
Or I guess you're still waiting
for yours to show up.

21:08.978 --> 21:11.815
Well, you ain't acting like somebody
who wants something from me.

21:11.898 --> 21:14.025
-Purchasing.
-[automated voice] <i>What department?</i>

21:14.108 --> 21:15.860
Purchasing!

21:15.944 --> 21:18.613
-[automated voice] <i>What department?</i>
-[sighs] Human being.

21:18.697 --> 21:20.699
Let me speak to a human.

21:20.782 --> 21:22.534
I'm a human.

21:22.617 --> 21:23.785
[automated voice]
<i>If you'd like to connect to...</i>

21:23.868 --> 21:25.119
Come in.

21:27.205 --> 21:28.206
You got voicemail trouble?

21:28.290 --> 21:31.335
Uh, typical corporate Charlie Foxtrot.

21:31.418 --> 21:33.252
This is why I don't wear a suit.

21:33.337 --> 21:35.547
This... and my quads are too big.

21:36.631 --> 21:38.717
[stutters] Uh, don't... wait.
Hey. Don't close that.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.093
Sorry.

21:42.804 --> 21:45.432
I'm Piper Chapman.
I don't mean to alarm you.

21:45.515 --> 21:47.934
I never come
to the administration like this.

21:48.017 --> 21:51.145
But I've been in Litchfield
for a while now...

21:53.022 --> 21:55.525
and I have started to feel
unsafe lately.

21:55.609 --> 21:57.110
Scared even.

21:57.193 --> 21:59.488
The prison is changing somehow.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.867
-Graffiti on the walls--
-I'm aware.

22:04.993 --> 22:07.829
And I just wanted to make sure
you knew about...

22:10.081 --> 22:13.251
let's say, a cluster of girls
that I've noticed.

22:13.335 --> 22:14.961
Do they gather in groups
of four or more?

22:15.044 --> 22:18.715
Oh, yeah. They gather.
They are pretty much always gathering.

22:18.798 --> 22:23.219
Have you seen them flashing hand signals
or wearing the same colors?

22:23.302 --> 22:26.640
I think I've seen a bunch of them
wearing red slipper socks.

22:26.723 --> 22:28.307
[sighs]

22:28.392 --> 22:30.477
And I'm not exactly sure
that this is relevant,

22:30.560 --> 22:32.479
but just so you have
all the information,

22:32.562 --> 22:34.230
these girls...

22:35.899 --> 22:37.651
share a certain heritage,

22:37.734 --> 22:40.153
a certain noble heritage,

22:40.236 --> 22:43.031
dating all the way back
to ancient Mayan civilization.

22:43.114 --> 22:45.617
The Latinas. Got it.

22:45.700 --> 22:47.368
Well, I wasn't gonna say anything.

22:47.452 --> 22:48.870
Chapman...

22:50.038 --> 22:54.626
what you're describing
is a prison gang in its infancy.

22:54.709 --> 22:56.210
That sounds serious.

22:57.504 --> 22:58.755
[sighs] Well...

22:59.756 --> 23:02.383
not if we can prevent
them from growing

23:02.467 --> 23:04.135
and getting organized.

23:04.218 --> 23:06.805
Thank you so much, Mr. Piscatella.

23:08.264 --> 23:09.766
I feel safer already.

23:10.934 --> 23:12.143
[exhales]

23:13.770 --> 23:16.230
You know what?
I really love your beard.

23:16.314 --> 23:18.567
I've had a beard since tenth grade.

23:18.650 --> 23:20.902
Two beards, actually.

23:20.985 --> 23:24.238
The one on my face,
and the one I took to junior prom.

23:25.699 --> 23:27.408
Yeah.

23:27.492 --> 23:28.910
I like dudes.

23:30.704 --> 23:33.247
I will never find you adorable.

23:34.541 --> 23:36.375
Keep that in mind.

23:44.759 --> 23:46.553
When I first started out...

23:47.721 --> 23:50.348
I thought the best way to help an inmate

23:50.431 --> 23:53.434
was to get involved in
his day-to-day problems.

23:54.310 --> 23:58.439
The poor guy who was transferred
ten states away from his family.

23:58.523 --> 24:01.860
The fella who's on
a downward spiral in Seg.

24:01.943 --> 24:05.655
But what I learned is that
to actually help them,

24:05.739 --> 24:09.868
you have to make their lives feel full.

24:09.951 --> 24:11.828
One time I did the math.

24:11.911 --> 24:16.374
I figured that, all together,
the inmates on my watch

24:16.457 --> 24:21.963
had over 17,000 years
of time on their sentences.

24:22.046 --> 24:23.089
[audience gasping]

24:23.172 --> 24:25.174
Seventeen thousand years.

24:27.969 --> 24:30.764
That's longer than human recorded history.

24:32.431 --> 24:37.020
That is a hell of a lot of time
to get something accomplished,

24:37.103 --> 24:39.898
to redeem lives.

24:39.981 --> 24:42.025
[shudders] I just got the goosies.

24:42.108 --> 24:45.194
If only we can stop fixating on the days,

24:45.278 --> 24:48.156
and start thinking about the years.

24:48.239 --> 24:50.742
[chatter and applause]

24:55.747 --> 24:57.791
[typing]

25:03.880 --> 25:05.089
[groans]

25:15.850 --> 25:18.352
[chuckles]

25:18.436 --> 25:20.396
[rock music playing]

25:25.026 --> 25:27.111
Oh, hell, no.

25:30.574 --> 25:32.491
-[whimpers]
-[comical music playing]

25:32.576 --> 25:33.702
[giggles]

25:33.785 --> 25:36.162
Aw, so cute.

25:37.664 --> 25:39.540
[indistinct chatter]

25:40.834 --> 25:43.628
Maybe it's a real old person
and they can't help it.

25:43.712 --> 25:46.005
Nah, it's not an accident.

25:46.089 --> 25:48.925
Plus, you gotta be able to squat
to poop in a shower,

25:49.008 --> 25:52.053
and old people are bad at squatting.

25:52.136 --> 25:55.932
Maybe they're very busy,
and they're multitasking.

25:56.015 --> 25:59.102
My sister used to brush her teeth
in the shower.

26:02.981 --> 26:04.941
[inmates talking indistinctly]

26:05.024 --> 26:06.192
[inmate] Takin' all the hot water!

26:13.617 --> 26:14.701
Squatter.

26:14.784 --> 26:17.120
-A-ha!
-[gasps]

26:17.203 --> 26:18.329
Fuck off.

26:18.412 --> 26:20.414
-Sorry.
-Nice work.

26:22.667 --> 26:23.752
[Lorna] So, here's the thing.

26:23.835 --> 26:26.671
I don't think the pooper's
gonna poop at peak time.

26:26.755 --> 26:29.423
Oh, unless
they're an exhibitionist pooper.

26:29.507 --> 26:31.926
-A poopscabitionist.
-Hmm.

26:32.010 --> 26:33.219
Let me ask you this.

26:33.302 --> 26:36.640
How do they start in those
detective novels?

26:36.723 --> 26:40.601
They gather up the usual suspects,
people with criminal records.

26:40.685 --> 26:42.145
-Oh, criminal records, you say?
-[woman] Fuck off!

26:42.228 --> 26:45.273
Suzanne, hey.
That's everyone.

26:45.356 --> 26:46.775
True.

26:46.858 --> 26:48.484
True, true, true.

26:48.567 --> 26:52.906
Well, they also try to get inside
of the mind of the criminal.

26:55.408 --> 26:57.869
Hello... Suzanne.

27:00.789 --> 27:02.206
Ugh...

27:04.083 --> 27:05.376
That's my ex.

27:05.459 --> 27:06.961
Oh, my goodness.
She is pretty.

27:07.796 --> 27:10.298
She could use a little more makeup,
of course.

27:10.381 --> 27:13.342
They make it waterproof now,
so you never have to take it off.

27:13.426 --> 27:15.344
Yeah, I mean, it was good for a while,

27:15.428 --> 27:18.014
but then she started
getting too clingy.

27:18.097 --> 27:22.060
You know, started leaving little gifts
on my pillow, like daisy chains.

27:22.143 --> 27:27.899
You don't think that she might be leaving
any other kinds of "gifts"?

27:27.982 --> 27:29.693
No.

27:32.111 --> 27:34.280
No.

27:37.075 --> 27:39.660
Suspect number one.

27:39.744 --> 27:41.788
The game is afoot.

27:41.871 --> 27:43.915
[man on PA] <i>Attention, inmates.</i>
<i>The updated facility rules</i>

27:43.998 --> 27:46.751
<i>and inmate discipline list</i>
<i>is posted in the day room.</i>

27:51.005 --> 27:52.215
All right, get out of here.

27:54.425 --> 27:56.803
All right, ladies.
Up against the wall.

27:56.886 --> 27:57.971
This is straight-up profiling.

27:58.054 --> 28:00.389
Oh, no, no.
These are just random searches.

28:01.557 --> 28:02.767
-Get it out.
-And what about her?

28:02.851 --> 28:03.893
Hands against the wall.

28:03.977 --> 28:05.186
-I didn't do nothing.
-Shut up.

28:08.356 --> 28:09.733
Oh, bingo.

28:11.860 --> 28:13.527
How many shots is that, Humps?

28:14.570 --> 28:16.364
As many as you want.

28:21.828 --> 28:24.080
It's just one shot for you.

28:24.163 --> 28:25.874
Next time bring enough for everybody.

28:25.957 --> 28:28.542
Hey, Humphrey, how do you know
when an inmate's lying?

28:28.626 --> 28:30.544
-How?
-She opens her mouth.

28:31.545 --> 28:33.131
That's funny.

28:33.214 --> 28:34.298
Well, hey there, Hot Pants.

28:34.382 --> 28:36.175
-You talking to me?
-Well, that's your name, isn't it?

28:36.259 --> 28:38.386
-Actually, it's Mendoza.
-Oh, that wasn't a question.

28:38.469 --> 28:39.637
[groans]

28:39.721 --> 28:42.056
Better get a cavity search on that one.

28:42.140 --> 28:44.058
She's gotta be hiding something
in an ass that big.

28:44.142 --> 28:45.268
Oh, yeah?

28:46.936 --> 28:48.855
It helps to give 'em a compliment,
now and then.

28:48.938 --> 28:49.939
Boosts morale.

28:50.023 --> 28:52.108
Don't think I'm not taking this
to your superior.

28:52.191 --> 28:54.485
Oh, Officer Dixon
answers to Officer Dixon.

28:54.568 --> 28:56.362
Don't we answer to Piscatella?

28:56.445 --> 28:59.032
Jesus, McCullough.
You are such a boner killer.

29:00.074 --> 29:02.243
Make sure you go deep. [laughs]

29:08.833 --> 29:12.796
"Media Relations:
Turning Scandals into Scandal-ade."

29:12.879 --> 29:14.630
That sounds useful.
Put a star by it.

29:14.713 --> 29:15.840
Yeah.

29:15.924 --> 29:18.051
Uh... "Prison Health Care
Rights and Wrongs:

29:18.134 --> 29:20.845

29:20.929 --> 29:22.180
Mmm... nah.

29:23.222 --> 29:26.559
"Immigration Violations:
The Next Gold Mine."

29:28.227 --> 29:29.478
What was the last gold mine?

29:30.980 --> 29:33.274
I don't know, the war on drugs, I guess?

29:33.357 --> 29:34.525
[chuckles]

29:39.823 --> 29:44.035
That thing he said,
about making their lives full.

29:44.118 --> 29:45.369
Feel full.

29:46.287 --> 29:47.789
You think we can do that at Litchfield?

29:48.539 --> 29:49.958
We can do whatever we want.

29:51.876 --> 29:53.544
Well, I want that.

29:54.628 --> 29:56.547
I wanna give that to them.

29:57.173 --> 29:59.008
As long as it fits in the budget.

29:59.092 --> 30:00.718
[Linda chuckles]

30:02.386 --> 30:03.847
[sighs heavily]

30:03.930 --> 30:05.556
I'm a little nervous.

30:06.765 --> 30:09.018
-About the panel?
-Mmm-hmm.

30:09.102 --> 30:10.269
You're gonna be great.

30:10.353 --> 30:12.563
I mean, I know purchasing
isn't a sexy topic

30:12.646 --> 30:14.607
like drugs or capital punishment, but--

30:14.690 --> 30:15.691
Don't say that.

30:15.774 --> 30:20.196
I just am gonna be up there
representing MCC and I...

30:20.279 --> 30:22.281
I really wanna knock it out of the park.

30:22.365 --> 30:23.908
Linda...

30:23.992 --> 30:26.953
you don't even know what you are.

30:27.912 --> 30:31.290
-You are the Mickey Mantle of MCC.
-[giggles]

30:31.374 --> 30:35.336
[chuckles] You are the Cy Young
of Correctional Purchasing.

30:35.419 --> 30:36.921
Are those sports people?

30:37.671 --> 30:39.090
Does the pope shit in the woods?

30:39.173 --> 30:40.633
[laughing]

30:40.716 --> 30:42.844
Oh, Joe. You're so funny.

30:46.472 --> 30:50.226
Oh, look, "Shanks for the Memories:
A History of Prison Weapons."

30:54.898 --> 30:56.482
[Reema sighs]

30:56.565 --> 30:57.942
Bye-bye, sleep mask.

30:58.860 --> 31:00.486
Time to meet my snizz.

31:00.569 --> 31:02.613
Think it'll stay in?

31:02.696 --> 31:05.491
Just don't lose it up there,
that could get serious.

31:08.786 --> 31:10.872
[Reema] Well, la-di-da.

31:11.915 --> 31:14.000
Little Miss One Percent herself.

31:14.083 --> 31:15.877
Hey, what are you charging
for one of those?

31:18.379 --> 31:20.006
Five dollars.

31:20.882 --> 31:23.051
Guadalupe was charging a buck yesterday!

31:23.134 --> 31:26.137
Inflation, like we back in the Bush era.

31:26.220 --> 31:28.639
Bitch, you never left the Bush era,

31:28.722 --> 31:31.225
judging by all that
creeping from your panties.

31:31.309 --> 31:33.019
I'll give you three bucks.

31:34.353 --> 31:35.354
You got it right now?

31:35.438 --> 31:37.231
No, but I can get it to you
by the end of the week.

31:37.315 --> 31:39.650
Don't do it.
She'll charge you interest.

31:39.733 --> 31:41.069
That's what her people do.

31:42.695 --> 31:47.283
I know you did not just call me
a money lender.

31:47.366 --> 31:48.993
'Cause that right there
would be hate speech.

31:49.077 --> 31:51.870
[Alison] What if we got
something to trade?

31:51.955 --> 31:53.706
Something you might really want.

31:53.789 --> 31:55.917
No trades.

31:57.043 --> 32:03.799
The only language this Jew here speak
is cold hard cash.

32:04.675 --> 32:07.511
You see, it's okay when I say it.

32:39.002 --> 32:40.461
[indistinct chatter]

32:46.968 --> 32:48.136
Is anything the matter?

32:48.844 --> 32:50.471
Gold star for you, Chapman.

32:51.389 --> 32:52.681
Your intel was good.

32:52.765 --> 32:53.975
Really?

32:56.269 --> 32:58.437
-What did you find out?
-None of your concern.

32:59.938 --> 33:01.232
Let me just say,

33:01.315 --> 33:04.777
if you felt like assembling
a group of like-minded individuals,

33:04.860 --> 33:06.820
reliable inmates like yourself,

33:06.904 --> 33:09.532
with an interest in keeping
this prison gang-free...

33:10.366 --> 33:12.493
I assembled a task force once at Smith.

33:13.827 --> 33:15.746
There was somebody putting
bubble baths in all the fountains,

33:15.829 --> 33:17.123
and we totally caught her.

33:17.206 --> 33:18.291
Bubble bath.

33:19.250 --> 33:20.876
Is that related to bath salts?

33:20.959 --> 33:22.753
No, it's just bubbles.

33:22.836 --> 33:24.297
For baths?

33:24.963 --> 33:28.259
It was right before parents weekend,
so the administration was really upset.

33:30.011 --> 33:31.637
But gangs.

33:31.720 --> 33:33.222
Gangs, Mr. Piscatella...

33:34.307 --> 33:36.017
gangs are the issue here.

33:36.100 --> 33:38.936
And I will assemble
a task force to stop them.

33:40.688 --> 33:41.689
Sir.

33:41.772 --> 33:44.358
You really shouldn't do that
unless you're in the armed forces.

33:44.442 --> 33:45.776
How do you know I'm not?

33:47.820 --> 33:49.238
It won't happen again.

33:53.617 --> 33:56.204
Mr. Piscatella, you got a minute?

33:56.954 --> 33:58.914
-What is it, inmate?
-Gloria Mendoza.

33:58.997 --> 34:00.416
I just thought that you should know

34:00.499 --> 34:02.918
that some of your new guards
are stopping girls for no reason

34:03.001 --> 34:05.546
-and being extra invasive.
-Yeah?

34:05.629 --> 34:07.256
And everyone they're stopping
looks like...

34:07.340 --> 34:08.924
Like you?

34:09.425 --> 34:11.302
Look, I didn't go
to law school or nothing,

34:11.385 --> 34:14.597
but I know that they gotta be
stepping on a few civil liberties here.

34:14.679 --> 34:17.014
You committed a crime, inmate.

34:17.975 --> 34:21.353
So, if you wanna see who
"stepped on your civil liberties,"

34:21.437 --> 34:23.481
check under your own boot.

34:30.571 --> 34:33.116
Flaca and Maritza together again.

34:33.199 --> 34:36.702
It's like we're back in the kitchen,
but crime-ier.

34:36.784 --> 34:38.996
Does it show?

34:39.080 --> 34:41.706
Mmm-mmm, it looks like
you had a big plate of pasta.

34:41.790 --> 34:43.542
Oh, my God, I'm a fatty!

34:43.626 --> 34:45.043
But it's for a good cause.

34:46.087 --> 34:47.755
[sighs] Are you nervous?

34:47.838 --> 34:48.922
It's only boys.

34:49.005 --> 34:51.300
Once you get the blood
rushing to their dicks,

34:51.384 --> 34:52.760
they're like your servants.

34:52.842 --> 34:54.969
All I gotta do is convince the one guy

34:55.053 --> 34:57.973
who always watches me to go inside
and party with the others.

34:58.056 --> 35:00.768
Then there's ten minutes
before I drive the day shift up.

35:00.851 --> 35:04.272
Ten minutes for Alonso
to grab that shit from the wheel well.

35:05.398 --> 35:06.565
[whispering] Shit.

35:10.111 --> 35:11.529
-Go now.
-What?

35:11.612 --> 35:13.364
Do it! Do it now, trust me.

35:18.161 --> 35:19.578
What, I don't get any love?

35:21.205 --> 35:22.290
Well, that's a new one.

35:22.373 --> 35:25.376
We don't get touched a lot in here,
except by the lezzies.

35:25.459 --> 35:27.711
Sometimes, you need
a little human contact.

35:27.795 --> 35:29.338
Especially by an expert.

35:32.550 --> 35:33.759
[gasps]

35:39.973 --> 35:41.016
Ooh!

35:52.820 --> 35:54.197
You're all set.

35:54.280 --> 35:56.282
Hope it was as good for you
as it was for me.

35:56.365 --> 35:58.242
Don't forget about my friend over there.

35:58.326 --> 36:00.786
She really misses her boyfriend.

36:00.869 --> 36:02.705
Last frisk of the day.

36:08.252 --> 36:09.337
[sighs]

36:13.174 --> 36:14.383
[Maritza chuckles lightly]

36:15.718 --> 36:17.178
[sighs]

36:53.922 --> 36:55.132
Can I help you, miss?

36:55.216 --> 36:57.635
I'm just looking for now, thanks.

36:58.261 --> 37:00.012
So comfy.

37:00.095 --> 37:02.931
-I'm Lucas, if you need anything.
-Thanks.

37:12.566 --> 37:14.277
Ever drive one of these bad boys?

37:14.360 --> 37:15.861
Uh... [chuckles]

37:15.944 --> 37:18.947
I wasted half my life driving a Saab.

37:19.031 --> 37:21.116
My wife always said
they were safe in an accident.

37:21.617 --> 37:25.329
But they still couldn't pull any bodies
from the car wreck of our marriage.

37:26.705 --> 37:28.541
[both chuckle]

37:28.624 --> 37:29.625
You are bad.

37:31.377 --> 37:32.378
Well...

37:33.045 --> 37:35.213
you see anything here you like?

37:35.298 --> 37:37.550
Uh... definitely.

37:37.633 --> 37:39.385
Uh, what would you recommend?

37:39.468 --> 37:42.137
Well, the Gran Turismo is awesome,

37:42.220 --> 37:46.183
but the Gran Cabrio always gives me
a special little tingle. [giggles]

37:46.267 --> 37:48.226
The Gran Cabrio it is.

37:48.977 --> 37:52.440
We're just gonna need some ID
and I'll go hook you up with the keys.

38:03.326 --> 38:05.286
How can we help you today, Mrs...

38:05.369 --> 38:06.370
Spencer.

38:07.413 --> 38:10.708
My hubby and I would like to take
the Gran Cabrio out for a spin.

38:12.167 --> 38:13.544
He's the one over there.

38:13.627 --> 38:15.087
Ain't he cute?

38:16.088 --> 38:17.172
Very distinguished.

38:17.255 --> 38:18.716
His name is Edward.

38:20.133 --> 38:22.803
All right, Mrs. Spencer.

38:22.886 --> 38:25.848
You are all set.

38:25.931 --> 38:28.141
You can take the one down
in front in Etruscan onyx.

38:29.226 --> 38:31.144
Uh, Etruscan...

38:31.228 --> 38:33.063
Between the classic obsidian
and the midnight noir.

38:33.146 --> 38:35.316
Oh, the Etruscan onyx!

38:39.737 --> 38:42.155
Wait till you feel this transaxle layout.

38:42.239 --> 38:44.199
A pretty lady who knows cars.

38:44.282 --> 38:45.909
This is like a junior high wet dream.

38:45.993 --> 38:48.537
It's important to chase your dreams.
After you.

38:54.460 --> 38:55.669
[gasps]

39:00.758 --> 39:02.760
Hey, sorry I got held up.

39:02.843 --> 39:05.178
Can't wait to tell you more
about this beauty.

39:07.723 --> 39:09.725
[engine starting and revving]

39:16.106 --> 39:18.191
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

39:21.945 --> 39:24.615
It's a pretty good squat
you got there, Jefferson.

39:24.698 --> 39:26.617
Strong knees.

39:26.700 --> 39:27.826
Thanks.

39:27.910 --> 39:29.995
Do you find yourself squatting

39:30.078 --> 39:33.290
in unusual places
throughout the course of your day?

39:33.374 --> 39:36.377
Places that people
wouldn't normally squat?

39:36.460 --> 39:38.837
What the fuck are you talking about?

39:38.921 --> 39:40.464
I have no idea.

40:09.034 --> 40:10.077
[exhales]

40:12.329 --> 40:14.998
[Linda] I mean, we have all met those CFOs

40:15.082 --> 40:18.877
who think that Purchasing
is only about cost reduction.

40:18.961 --> 40:22.297
But it's like, hello, haven't they ever
heard of strategic sourcing,

40:22.380 --> 40:25.175
discount procurement,
or commodity cultivation?

40:25.258 --> 40:26.259
[man] That's fascinating.

40:26.343 --> 40:29.972
I'm sorry to take us
into choppy waters, but...

40:30.055 --> 40:32.224
how do you respond to the critics who say

40:32.307 --> 40:36.437
the bottom line is affecting
the prisoners' quality of life?

40:36.520 --> 40:38.021
Well, that is a good question.

40:39.272 --> 40:42.317
And at the end of the day,
it is a prison, not the Four Seasons.

40:42.400 --> 40:44.027
[laughing]

40:44.111 --> 40:45.904
[chuckles] Um... but all joking aside,

40:45.988 --> 40:49.199
we at MCC have found
that the prisoners' quality of life

40:49.282 --> 40:52.119
has actually improved
with the advent of cost--

40:52.202 --> 40:54.580
Why don't you tell 'em
how you doubled the beds, Linda?

40:54.663 --> 40:56.999
-[indistinct murmuring]
-Uh... [chuckles]

40:57.082 --> 40:58.166
As I was saying--

40:58.250 --> 41:00.919
Or tell 'em about how
the food makes everyone puke?

41:01.670 --> 41:02.671
[scoffs]

41:02.755 --> 41:05.132
Or that Sophia Burset
is in the SHU for no reason?

41:05.215 --> 41:06.592
Hey! That's enough.

41:06.675 --> 41:08.218
Well, if the gentleman has finished,

41:08.301 --> 41:10.471
-there will be a Q and A--
-Yeah. I'm finished all right.

41:10.554 --> 41:13.265
I'm finished with a company
that refuses to acknowledge

41:13.348 --> 41:16.519
what happens when
we monetize human beings.

41:16.602 --> 41:18.854
-[man] Do you wanna sit down?
-Do you even see yourselves?

41:18.937 --> 41:22.733
The magic lasers, and...
and prison ice cream.

41:22.816 --> 41:28.030
This whole thing is a disgusting display
of how industry dollars are spent.

41:28.113 --> 41:29.823
And I was like you a few months ago.

41:29.907 --> 41:32.826
I used to come
to this conference every year,

41:32.910 --> 41:35.704
[stammers] and I never thought
about the inmates.

41:35.788 --> 41:40.042
[stammering] But, you know,
maybe you're too afraid to admit it,

41:40.125 --> 41:42.878
but if you just go to my web page,
Dannytalkstruth.com--

41:42.961 --> 41:43.962
Why don't you come with me?

41:44.046 --> 41:45.463
Well, I bought a ticket
like everybody else.

41:45.548 --> 41:47.800
Hey, why don't you let him go?
He's harmless.

41:47.883 --> 41:50.010
-Uh, don't call me harmless, but I--
-Are you with him?

41:50.093 --> 41:51.094
I'm just trying to help.

41:51.178 --> 41:52.846
-Hey--
-Step back, step back. [grunts]

41:52.930 --> 41:54.097
-[all gasp]
-[officer] That's it. You're done.

41:54.181 --> 41:55.683
Shit. I'm sorry.

41:55.766 --> 41:57.518
This is a misunderstanding.

41:57.601 --> 41:58.811
I am the warden at Litchfield.

41:58.894 --> 42:00.437
The Director of Human Activities.

42:00.521 --> 42:02.105
It's the same fucking thing.

42:02.189 --> 42:04.482
-[Pearson] It's a small point. Sorry, Joe.
-It's the same thing.

42:04.567 --> 42:05.734
[audience murmuring]

42:06.735 --> 42:10.531
-CorrectiCon Assaultimore, am I right?
-[both chuckle]

42:11.532 --> 42:13.283
[chuckles nervously]

42:17.788 --> 42:20.666
[indistinct radio chatter]

42:20.749 --> 42:22.751
Are you sure you don't wanna come with?

42:22.835 --> 42:25.378
We have to take the day shift up
in ten minutes.

42:25.462 --> 42:27.673
You can get pretty drunk in ten minutes.

42:27.756 --> 42:30.050
You want me to leave Ramos unattended?

42:30.133 --> 42:31.218
Or bring her with.

42:31.301 --> 42:33.220
You two can give us a little show.

42:35.097 --> 42:37.099
We're good here, thanks.

42:49.527 --> 42:52.155
Aren't you kinda curious
what they do in there?

42:52.239 --> 42:54.157
I know exactly what they do.

42:54.241 --> 42:58.036
Scratch each other's balls
and play <i>Call of Duty: Guantanamo.</i>

43:03.208 --> 43:06.003
Can you believe this whole maxi pad thing?

43:06.086 --> 43:08.631
I got a wad of toilet paper
so far up my hoohoo,

43:09.339 --> 43:11.258
I'm not sure it's ever gonna come out.

43:11.341 --> 43:13.844
And it's giving me a not-so-fresh feeling.

43:13.927 --> 43:16.972
I got a box of tampons at my place.
You can borrow one.

43:17.055 --> 43:19.474
-Really?
-Just make sure you return it.

43:21.184 --> 43:23.604
[both laughing]

43:41.664 --> 43:44.582
The torque vectoring is akin
to what you'd find at the Indy 500.

43:44.667 --> 43:48.045
Oh, yeah, I can feel the... torque.

43:48.128 --> 43:50.673
485 foot-pounds of torque.

43:50.756 --> 43:52.549
A Ferrari is only 400.

43:53.425 --> 43:55.177
You know a lot about cars.

43:55.260 --> 43:57.220
Uh, I sure do.

43:57.304 --> 43:59.973
Are there a lot of women in the industry?

44:01.767 --> 44:04.061
Mmm... what would you say?

44:04.144 --> 44:07.022
Yeah, but they're mostly glorified
hood ornaments, I'm afraid.

44:07.105 --> 44:09.692
-[all laughing]
-How long have you two been together?

44:09.775 --> 44:12.903
-Me and her?
-About ten minutes, ha!

44:12.986 --> 44:14.404
[nervous laughter]

44:14.487 --> 44:15.823
At least, it feels that way.

44:15.906 --> 44:18.366
Time moves pretty fast.

44:18.450 --> 44:20.452
-But not as fast as one of these babies!
-Mmm.

44:20.535 --> 44:21.954
Do you have kids?

44:22.037 --> 44:23.163
Yeah...

44:23.246 --> 44:25.082
Two spoiled little monsters.

44:25.165 --> 44:26.667
Fourteen and 16.

44:28.168 --> 44:29.627
From a previous marriage?

44:29.712 --> 44:31.629
Well, I've only been married the once.

44:31.714 --> 44:32.965
Learned my lesson.

44:33.048 --> 44:35.467
-I'm sorry, I thought you--
-Edward's pretty tough to nail down.

44:35.550 --> 44:38.386
[laughing] But you can't blame me
for trying.

44:38.470 --> 44:40.472
Trying to close the deal, so to speak.

44:40.555 --> 44:41.974
Good. What about you?

44:42.057 --> 44:43.141
You have kids?

44:44.977 --> 44:46.478
No, silly.

44:46.561 --> 44:48.438
Why would I keep that a secret?
[chuckles]

44:48.521 --> 44:49.522
Classic Edward.

44:49.606 --> 44:51.859
Actually, it's Teddy.

44:51.942 --> 44:54.444
Wait till you hear this sound system.

44:55.320 --> 44:57.530
[rock music playing]

44:59.657 --> 45:01.576
[yelling] How did you guys meet?

45:01.659 --> 45:03.703
Ooh, feel that bass!

45:03.787 --> 45:06.915
-What kind of meat?
-I just love hair metal!

45:06.999 --> 45:09.001
Meet! Where did you meet?

45:10.252 --> 45:12.712
Can you pull over?
I think I'm gonna be sick!

45:17.175 --> 45:18.343
[Maritza] Oh.

45:23.306 --> 45:24.808
[coughs]

45:28.478 --> 45:30.022
Are you gonna check on her?

45:31.356 --> 45:33.776
I was gonna ask you the same.

45:33.859 --> 45:35.193
[mimics retching]

45:36.862 --> 45:38.030
[coughs]

45:40.490 --> 45:42.075
[continues coughing]

45:44.036 --> 45:46.079
-You okay, sweetie?
-[panting]

45:50.083 --> 45:51.626
Hey! Where the hell are you going?

45:51.709 --> 45:53.086
[Teddy] What are you doing?

45:53.753 --> 45:55.422
[engine revving]

46:02.554 --> 46:03.972
So, how will you be paying?

46:04.056 --> 46:05.808
[indistinct chatter]

46:14.191 --> 46:15.442
You're missing an "E" in "careers."

46:15.525 --> 46:17.027
It's "carers."

46:18.570 --> 46:19.863
Like you care.

46:21.156 --> 46:22.365
Like you give a shit.

46:22.449 --> 46:24.201
[Sankey] "Community Carers"?

46:25.160 --> 46:26.286
That sounds kind of gay.

46:27.704 --> 46:29.747
Gay for safety, maybe.

46:29.832 --> 46:30.958
Gay for justice.

46:31.041 --> 46:33.251
-Huh?
-It is not gay.

46:33.335 --> 46:35.795
At least in the pejorative sense.

46:35.879 --> 46:37.840
We are a group of like-minded individuals

46:37.923 --> 46:42.510
that does not want to see this prison
overrun by gangs and gang violence.

46:42.594 --> 46:44.012
Don't you want that?

46:45.180 --> 46:46.598
I do. Ow.

46:48.934 --> 46:50.227
You need help spreading the word?

46:53.146 --> 46:54.772
[both laughing]

46:54.857 --> 46:56.441
I love it here.

46:56.524 --> 47:00.320
It's, like, where we met,
when you think about it.

47:00.403 --> 47:01.989
Yeah, it was pretty romantic.

47:02.072 --> 47:05.033
I mean, you were drooling
and dead and shit.

47:05.117 --> 47:06.368
[both laughing]

47:06.451 --> 47:09.746
And I'm freaking the fuck out.

47:09.829 --> 47:11.915
Can you read me something in German?

47:11.999 --> 47:13.791
I think it's such a pretty language.

47:13.876 --> 47:16.836
Yeah, maybe compared to, like, American?

47:17.504 --> 47:20.757
-You're so weird. [laughs]
-Stop it! You're weird.

47:20.840 --> 47:22.926
Let's go find...
let's go find the Rilke.

47:23.010 --> 47:24.802
Yes!

47:24.887 --> 47:26.846
-Yes!
-[giggles] Okay.

47:28.223 --> 47:29.599
-Turn around, it's this way.
-Mmm-mmm. What?

47:29.682 --> 47:32.727
-[indistinct talking]
-[laughs]

47:32.810 --> 47:34.479
Yay! Story time! [giggles]

47:34.562 --> 47:36.314
Oh. Shh.

47:37.315 --> 47:38.858
She's been studying all morning.

47:40.903 --> 47:45.157
[gasps] Oh, my God, trig!
My second favorite category in Mathletics.

47:46.199 --> 47:49.161
Lucky me.
A fairy god-chink to teach me math.

47:49.244 --> 47:53.540
That's an offensive generalization,
although apt in this case.

47:53.623 --> 47:55.125
Yeah, she plays the piano, too.

47:55.208 --> 47:57.585
But I think bubble tea is disgusting.

47:57.669 --> 47:59.963
And I never liked Hello Kitty.
She has no mouth.

48:00.047 --> 48:01.048
Okay!

48:01.131 --> 48:03.800
The angle of elevation
of a hot air balloon changes

48:03.883 --> 48:07.137
from 25 degrees at 10:00 a.m.
to 60 degrees at 10:02 a.m.

48:07.220 --> 48:09.932
Did you already figure out
the point of observation?

48:11.141 --> 48:12.225
What the fuck is she saying?

48:12.809 --> 48:15.145
[chuckles] Okay, this is gonna be fun.

48:15.228 --> 48:17.855
But... not as fun as calculus.

48:17.940 --> 48:20.358
I mean, calculus is
where math meets poetry.

48:20.442 --> 48:22.444
And together, they give me a brain tumor.

48:22.527 --> 48:23.695
Okay.

48:23.778 --> 48:27.782
First, you're gonna need to find out
the tangent of 25

48:27.865 --> 48:29.952
before we can figure out
the tangent of 60.

48:30.035 --> 48:31.828
I'm not gonna lie,
this is kind of turning me on.

48:31.911 --> 48:34.706
Is this the kind of thing
I can use in real life?

48:34.789 --> 48:38.876
'Cause I'm supposed to be
a productive member of society.

48:38.961 --> 48:39.962
Or some shit.

48:40.045 --> 48:42.172
Yeah, well, trig is very useful
in determining

48:42.255 --> 48:43.798
the distance between celestial bodies.

48:43.881 --> 48:45.467
You're a celestial body.

48:45.550 --> 48:47.302
[laughs] You're embarrassing me.

48:47.385 --> 48:49.346
Okay. Um...

48:49.429 --> 48:54.392
the upward speed
is 3.16 meters per second.

48:55.435 --> 48:57.645
See? There you go.
That wasn't too hard, was it?

48:57.729 --> 48:59.272
Yeah. Look at me go. [scoffs]

49:00.065 --> 49:01.858
Yeah! That's the spirit. [giggles]

49:07.280 --> 49:08.948
[Dixon] Are we talking about
the same McCullough?

49:09.574 --> 49:11.409
The one out there
with the resting bitch face.

49:11.493 --> 49:13.620
Oh, yeah.
Oh, she could totally be cute,

49:13.703 --> 49:15.998
if she got <i>Princess Diaried.</i>

49:16.873 --> 49:18.250
Oh, is that like, uh...

49:19.917 --> 49:21.253
What is that?

49:21.919 --> 49:24.422
It's where the chick in the movie is,
like, all right.

49:24.506 --> 49:26.466
Normal. Hot-girl-actress normal.

49:26.549 --> 49:28.885
-Ah.
-But then, straighten the hair, right,

49:28.968 --> 49:31.929
take the glasses off,
you fix her teeth.

49:32.014 --> 49:34.224
-Yeah.
-Give her a couple horse tranquilizers.

49:34.307 --> 49:36.601
-There you go.
-[scoffs]

49:36.684 --> 49:41.106
Dude, you play it so smooth,
but you're the biggest dick of all of us.

49:41.189 --> 49:42.315
Are you coming on to me?

49:42.399 --> 49:43.816
-Yes, I am.
-It's working.

49:45.110 --> 49:46.778
Hey, Stratman, you want my Coors?

49:47.362 --> 49:48.613
I haven't taken a sip of it yet.

49:48.696 --> 49:50.990
I'm sorry,
is Officer Dixon pacing himself?

49:51.074 --> 49:52.409
More room for JÃ¤ger.

49:52.492 --> 49:53.493
Oh.

49:54.411 --> 49:55.412
Sure, I guess.

49:55.495 --> 49:57.039
-[Dixon] There you go.
-Oh, fuck, man!

49:57.122 --> 49:58.581
-Oh!
-What the fuck?

49:58.665 --> 50:00.708
Oh! Classic!

50:00.792 --> 50:03.002
[laughs] Oh, classic.

50:03.086 --> 50:04.796
I'm never gonna be able to unsee that.

50:16.974 --> 50:18.226
Hey, who's the taco?

50:21.188 --> 50:22.397
Dude!

50:24.566 --> 50:26.609
Yo, <i>amigo!</i>
What are you doing here?

50:28.111 --> 50:29.154
[Dixon] Hey, bro.

50:29.237 --> 50:30.613
You <i>habla</i> English?

50:30.697 --> 50:32.157
[Maritza] 'Lonso!

50:32.240 --> 50:36.244
You're supposed to trim the bushes
on Wednesday, not Tuesday.

50:37.579 --> 50:38.663
[in Spanish] Follow me.

50:39.581 --> 50:42.334
-You know this dude?
-You guys haven't met Alonso?

50:42.417 --> 50:43.876
He's the gardener guy.

50:44.627 --> 50:46.546
I don't think I've ever seen him sober.

50:46.629 --> 50:49.507
No wonder he don't know
his Tuesday from his Wednesday.

50:49.591 --> 50:51.176
Oh, a man after my own heart.

50:51.759 --> 50:53.261
Well, hey, bro, if you could, uh...

50:53.345 --> 50:56.223
take care of the weeds and shit out front,

50:56.306 --> 50:58.350
I know me and the fellas
would really appreciate it.

50:58.933 --> 51:02.019
We may be animals,
but we're not, you know, animals.

51:03.771 --> 51:05.523
Yes, I... I will do that.

51:06.274 --> 51:07.442
Thanks.

51:17.285 --> 51:20.330
[in Spanish] You're smarter than you look,
pretty girl.

51:24.584 --> 51:25.793
[sighs]

51:35.553 --> 51:38.765
I know.
Sucks being a lady sometimes, doesn't it?

51:48.983 --> 51:50.568
It was... it was all a knee-jerk reaction.

51:50.652 --> 51:52.570
I would actually blame Danny for that.

51:52.654 --> 51:54.822
Go ahead, tell my dad.
I don't care.

51:55.948 --> 51:57.784
Why? Why would I tell your dad?

51:58.743 --> 51:59.786
No, I... [stuttering]

51:59.869 --> 52:02.664
I'm only saying if you did,
I wouldn't care.

52:04.374 --> 52:09.421
Danny, telling Jack that you were arrested
by a Baltimore rent-a-cop

52:09.504 --> 52:13.591
would mean telling him that I was arrested
by a Baltimore rent-a-cop.

52:13.675 --> 52:15.302
So rest easy.

52:15.385 --> 52:20.223
Your career as Norma Rae is safe with me.

52:20.307 --> 52:21.974
Oh. Okay.

52:22.809 --> 52:24.060
Thanks.

52:25.603 --> 52:27.564
'Course I can't speak for her.

52:30.775 --> 52:33.236
So... Linda, huh?

52:34.779 --> 52:36.198
I knew you were in bed with my father,

52:36.281 --> 52:38.741
but I didn't know you were doing it
with Satan herself.

52:38.825 --> 52:40.577
We're not doing it.

52:41.869 --> 52:43.288
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

52:45.415 --> 52:48.710
From one Director of Human Activity
to another...

52:48.793 --> 52:50.044
[whispers] watch out for that one.

52:53.631 --> 52:54.924
[Linda] Okay.

52:56.843 --> 52:59.346
I've convinced them that
you're no longer a threat to society.

53:01.514 --> 53:03.182
You can leave now, Danny.

53:04.434 --> 53:05.768
Boo. Hiss.

53:07.144 --> 53:09.439
Uh-uh. Not you.

53:09.522 --> 53:11.524
-I know, I...
-[door closes]

53:11.608 --> 53:12.817
I lost my cool in there.

53:12.900 --> 53:17.572
You should have followed MCC protocol
never to engage with a protester.

53:17.655 --> 53:21.576
But that is not your worst offense.

53:23.286 --> 53:24.746
You, sir...

53:24.829 --> 53:26.914
are arrested...

53:26.998 --> 53:29.501
for chivalry in the first degree.

53:30.293 --> 53:31.544
[chuckles] What?

53:31.628 --> 53:34.422
[laughs] Standing up for me like that.

53:35.590 --> 53:39.218
You are full of surprises, mister.

53:43.973 --> 53:45.433
[Linda moans]

53:46.809 --> 53:48.311
Those <i>Karate Kid</i> moves.

53:48.395 --> 53:50.438
-I got more moves where that came from.
-Oh, yeah?

53:50.522 --> 53:51.898
[moaning]

53:51.981 --> 53:53.441
Let's see.

53:57.028 --> 53:58.655
[breathes deeply]

54:01.616 --> 54:03.242
[Linda moaning]

54:04.619 --> 54:05.620
Oh!

54:06.579 --> 54:07.580
[exhales]

54:08.748 --> 54:09.749
[giggles]

54:12.001 --> 54:15.922
Let me start by saying,
I am so encouraged by this turnout.

54:16.839 --> 54:20.677
I always knew that Litchfield had
a strong community of carers.

54:20.760 --> 54:22.804
Women who are willing
to keep their eyes open

54:22.887 --> 54:25.765
for any miscreant activity,
any malfeasance.

54:28.685 --> 54:30.227
Bad stuff.

54:31.396 --> 54:33.356
There is a sickness sweeping this prison.

54:33.440 --> 54:34.482
Like an STD?

54:34.566 --> 54:37.360
A societal STD, you might say.

54:39.195 --> 54:40.613
And we...

54:41.656 --> 54:43.450
we get to be the antibodies.

54:43.533 --> 54:49.622
The medicated cream, I guess,
that then fights off that STD.

54:49.706 --> 54:53.460
Whenever you are walking down the halls
and you sense a shadowy presence,

54:53.543 --> 54:55.962
whenever the walls
are tainted with graffiti...

54:56.045 --> 54:58.423
-[chuckles] She said "taint."
-Shh.

54:58.506 --> 55:00.883
What I am trying to say is...

55:02.802 --> 55:06.305
will you join me on a quest
to keep our hallways clean

55:06.389 --> 55:08.975
and our hearts pure of purpose?

55:10.142 --> 55:12.103
Piper's right, you guys.

55:12.186 --> 55:15.940
You can't swing a cat around here lately
without hitting a dirty Dominican.

55:16.023 --> 55:17.442
Oh, no, that's not what I meant.

55:17.525 --> 55:20.820
Amen to that! You know, we're always
having to hear about Latin Pride.

55:20.903 --> 55:23.072
-Yeah.
-And Black Pride.

55:23.155 --> 55:24.323
And Asian Pride.

55:24.407 --> 55:25.492
Wait, Asian Pride?

55:25.575 --> 55:27.452
Yo, why can't there be
such a thing as White Pride?

55:27.535 --> 55:31.664
Yeah! We're always hearing
about how black lives matter.

55:31.748 --> 55:33.583
Well, don't our lives matter?

55:33.666 --> 55:34.917
Right?

55:35.001 --> 55:37.044
White lives matter.

55:37.128 --> 55:39.088
[chanting] White lives matter!

55:39.171 --> 55:41.215
White lives matter!

55:41.298 --> 55:43.259
[all] White lives matter!

55:43.342 --> 55:44.969
White lives matter!

55:45.052 --> 55:46.763
White lives matter!

55:46.846 --> 55:48.931
White lives matter!

55:49.015 --> 55:50.683
White lives matter!

55:50.767 --> 55:52.602
White lives matter!

55:52.685 --> 55:54.854
White lives matter!

55:54.937 --> 55:56.856
White lives matter!

55:56.939 --> 55:58.650
White lives matter!

55:58.733 --> 56:00.026
White lives matter!

56:00.109 --> 56:02.111
White lives matter!

56:02.194 --> 56:03.780
White lives matter!

56:03.863 --> 56:05.490
White lives matter!

56:05.573 --> 56:07.283
White lives matter!

56:07.366 --> 56:08.910
White lives matter!

56:08.993 --> 56:10.369
White lives matter!

56:10.453 --> 56:12.079
White lives matter!

56:12.163 --> 56:13.540
White lives matter!

56:13.623 --> 56:14.874
White lives matter!

56:14.957 --> 56:16.834
[chanting continues]
