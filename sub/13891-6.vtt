00:40.180 --> 00:43.580
MAN: Next up, an experiment
to measure peer pressure.

00:43.580 --> 00:45.180
How much is the individual

00:45.180 --> 00:46.580
influenced by the group?

00:46.580 --> 00:48.140
Seeing as Arnold Rimmer's late,

00:48.140 --> 00:51.100
the subject of this experiment
can be him. When he finally

00:51.100 --> 00:52.900
does us the honour of turning up,

00:52.900 --> 00:55.460
I shall ask you a set of questions

00:55.460 --> 00:57.740
and want you to answer accordingly.

01:00.900 --> 01:03.260
First day of term and I'm late!

01:03.260 --> 01:05.780
So embarrassing. He'll kill me.

01:08.660 --> 01:10.420
Ahh!

01:10.420 --> 01:11.940
Mr Rimmer!

01:11.940 --> 01:15.340
I hope we haven't inconvenienced you
too much by starting on time.

01:15.340 --> 01:16.540
Sorry, Father.

01:16.540 --> 01:18.460
I'm "Father" outside college.

01:18.460 --> 01:21.380
Inside college, I'm "sir"
or "Lecturer Rimmer", understand?

01:21.380 --> 01:23.020
Yes, Father.

01:23.020 --> 01:24.460
I mean, sir.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.220
So embarrassing.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.860
We're just about
to run through a few questions

01:28.860 --> 01:30.300
as part of psy profiling.

01:30.300 --> 01:32.140
OK,

01:32.140 --> 01:34.060
take a look at this colour.

01:34.060 --> 01:36.460
Is it purple, blue or green?

01:36.460 --> 01:37.860
Hands up, purple.

01:39.060 --> 01:40.500
Hands up, blue.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.460
Green.

01:54.300 --> 01:57.140
A fallopian tube
is a musical instrument.

01:57.140 --> 01:58.860
True or false?

01:58.860 --> 02:00.060
True?

02:06.220 --> 02:10.100
What's the answer
to this piece of arithmetic?

Oh, yes, you did!

04:01.380 --> 04:03.100
No, I smeggin' didn't!

04:03.100 --> 04:05.820
I are here to challenge
theys who kills my brother

04:05.820 --> 04:08.820
to a duel to the ungonising death.

04:08.820 --> 04:12.540
I will give you five of your
Earth minutes and then...

04:12.540 --> 04:17.060
I will pursue you across space
unto the end of time itself.

04:17.060 --> 04:22.220
I will not rest until you are
chokin' on your own warm blood.

04:23.780 --> 04:25.420
Sounds fair to me.

04:25.420 --> 04:27.940
Butt out, Rimmer.
Don't encourage him.

04:27.940 --> 04:32.580
Do you accept the challenge, humo,
a duel across time and space?

04:32.580 --> 04:34.860
No! Why?

04:34.860 --> 04:37.740
Hogey, you are always doing this -
picking fights

04:37.740 --> 04:41.020
and then challenging us to duels
across time and space.

04:41.020 --> 04:42.900
No, I not. Yes, you are.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.140
No, I not.

04:44.140 --> 04:46.540
Yes, you smeggin' are!

04:46.540 --> 04:49.780
You rogue droids are obsessed with
duels across time and space.

04:49.780 --> 04:51.260
You eesult my kind,

04:51.260 --> 04:55.660
saying we are obsessed with duels
across time and space.

04:55.660 --> 04:59.540
I therefore challenge you
to a duel across time and space.

04:59.540 --> 05:00.980
I will give you five of your...

05:00.980 --> 05:03.940
No duels across time and space.

05:03.940 --> 05:05.540
Why?!

05:05.540 --> 05:06.860
Look, at first, it was fun,

05:06.860 --> 05:09.300
it distracted us from being
stuck in deep space,

05:09.300 --> 05:11.020

05:11.020 --> 05:14.540

05:15.940 --> 05:18.660
Oh, please! No!

05:18.660 --> 05:21.020
I will give you a leetle start.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.780
No! But we are in deep space.

05:23.780 --> 05:25.500
It's light years from anywhere.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.020
There be nothing else to do.

05:27.020 --> 05:28.580
You think I don't know that?

05:28.580 --> 05:30.780
So, how we going to keep from
going crazy?

05:30.780 --> 05:32.540
For you, my friend,
it's way too late.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.900
How about a ping-pong marathon?

05:35.900 --> 05:37.940
Get a few buddies together.

05:45.180 --> 05:46.860
We'll give you a shot a hole.

05:46.860 --> 05:49.500
Oh, yeah, like we stand a chance.

05:49.500 --> 05:50.820

06:00.380 --> 06:02.140

06:09.740 --> 06:13.460
Ooh, choux pastry.
Big words, my demented friend.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.820
What are we playing for?

06:14.820 --> 06:16.700
If I win... LISTER: Oh...

06:16.700 --> 06:19.500
BOTH: ..a duel across time and space.
But if you win,

06:19.500 --> 06:24.580
a great treasure, the likes of which
you have never seen.

06:24.580 --> 06:27.660

No, thanks, we've already got one.

06:27.660 --> 06:28.860
Hey, it's a map.

06:28.860 --> 06:32.500

Everything's the likes of which
you've never seen with him.

06:35.180 --> 06:37.660
Do you doubt me? I'm just sayin',

06:37.660 --> 06:40.300
you'd be surprised the likes of which
we have seen.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.860
Don't be so quick to say everything's
the likes of which we haven't seen.

06:42.860 --> 06:45.540
We've seen things the likes of which
you probably haven't seen yourself.

06:46.620 --> 06:48.460
Is that a challenge?

06:48.460 --> 06:50.140

07:06.140 --> 07:07.540

07:07.540 --> 07:10.620
Not me. I steal while they slumber.

Is now a good time
to clean your quarters?

07:35.220 --> 07:37.540
Certainly looks like
it could do with a good tidy.

07:39.940 --> 07:43.140
Oh! Sorry, sir, I didn't realise
you had company.

07:43.140 --> 07:44.940
I'll rework my schedule.

07:48.660 --> 07:51.020
Sorry to intrude again, sir.

07:51.020 --> 07:55.100
When is a good time for my lesson
on human modes of speech?

07:55.100 --> 07:57.580
Oh, now's an excellent time, Kryten.

07:57.580 --> 07:59.860

Oh, what fun, sir!
That's sarcasm, right?

You see?
I am getting the hang of it!

08:05.220 --> 08:08.340
There's a ship outside!
They're attacking us!

08:13.300 --> 08:16.580
He's sealed the crack.
We've got to get out of here.

08:16.580 --> 08:19.140
We can't just leave him! Watch me.

08:20.580 --> 08:22.900
What's that? Oh, nothing.

08:24.780 --> 08:28.380
Look, I'll be back. I don't know how,
I don't know when. You abandon me?

08:28.380 --> 08:29.860
Then I have no choice.

08:29.860 --> 08:31.580
I challenge you to a duel...

Kryten, scan the local vicinity
for any anomalous energy patterns.

We're on EPS. Trying to reboot.

09:01.300 --> 09:02.740

We're being attacked by somethin'
but we don't know what,

09:04.740 --> 09:06.940
and there's no way
of finding out what's out there?

09:06.940 --> 09:09.260
I have a suggestion, sirs. What?

09:09.260 --> 09:12.700
How about we look out of the window?

09:16.060 --> 09:18.500
Sometimes the old ways
are the best ways.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.220
Do it.

09:20.220 --> 09:21.540
What, me, sir? On my own?

09:21.540 --> 09:23.340
Of course on your own.

09:23.340 --> 09:25.900

I'm on my way, sir.

Would you like a written report,
sir, or under these circumstances,

09:36.220 --> 09:38.100
would a verbal account suffice?

09:38.100 --> 09:40.060
Get on with it, man!
What's out there?

09:40.060 --> 09:42.420
A rogue Simulant Death Ship, sir.

09:42.420 --> 09:43.700
A Death Ship?

09:43.700 --> 09:45.540
Yes, sir. Should we be concerned?

09:45.540 --> 09:48.460
Concern would be an entirely
appropriate response

09:48.460 --> 09:50.380
under these circumstances, sir.

09:50.380 --> 09:52.380
What d'you think they want?

09:52.380 --> 09:53.540
Although the Death Ship

09:53.540 --> 09:56.300
didn't indicate the exact nature
of their business, sir,

09:56.300 --> 09:58.860
I'm guessing
it's something a bit...deathy.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.700
They must have been
tracking Hogey.

10:02.700 --> 10:05.180
Finding us is just a bonus.
Simulants!

10:05.180 --> 10:07.740
These are the guys
who despise humans, right?

10:07.740 --> 10:10.620
The ones who won't rest till they've
annihilated every single one.

10:10.620 --> 10:13.780
Correct, sir.
Not me, then. Excellent!

10:13.780 --> 10:15.180
I'll be in the rec room,

of I'm OK! Magazine.

10:19.220 --> 10:23.660

us all as Mr Lister's lieutenants.

10:23.660 --> 10:26.420
They will show us no mercy.

10:26.420 --> 10:29.620

by special berserker generals

10:54.100 --> 10:57.140
Forgiveness is a human quality,

10:57.140 --> 11:00.500
It has no meaning
to a Simulant general.

Firstly...

11:29.180 --> 11:31.420
polish my Sword of Spite...

11:32.900 --> 11:34.700
...as a punishment
for your idiocy...

11:34.700 --> 11:35.820
Polish?

11:35.820 --> 11:37.580
Yes. Polish.

11:37.580 --> 11:40.660
As a punishment
for your idiocy. Secondly...

11:40.660 --> 11:44.020
Just polish? Yes, just polish!

11:44.020 --> 11:45.420
Secondly...

11:45.420 --> 11:49.180
write me a formal letter of
apology.

11:49.180 --> 11:53.460
So, you just want me to polish
your sword and write a letter?

11:53.460 --> 11:55.340
Yes.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.820
Nothing else? Nothing else.

11:57.820 --> 12:00.100
So, you don't want me to, er...
ooh, I don't know, er,

12:00.100 --> 12:01.780
commit hari-kari or anything?

12:01.780 --> 12:03.140
Of course not!

12:07.740 --> 12:11.100
Well, sir, that wasn't made
very clear.

12:11.100 --> 12:14.060
Er, when you slid the sword
across the table,

12:14.060 --> 12:18.220
I naturally assumed you wanted me
to commit hari-kari.

12:18.220 --> 12:20.580
No, I do not!
Oh, I know that now, sir.

12:20.580 --> 12:23.340
Before, though, it was just...
you know, it was a bit ambiguous.

12:23.340 --> 12:26.500
Er...

12:26.500 --> 12:29.740
I think a new system is in order.

12:29.740 --> 12:31.060
I'm going to go now, sir.

12:31.060 --> 12:32.940
Er... My Dominator,

12:32.940 --> 12:34.500
thank you.

12:35.540 --> 12:37.060
Ooh.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.380
Uhh.

12:38.380 --> 12:40.700
Oh, Chancellor.

12:40.700 --> 12:43.700
You do have a tendency
to jump to conclusions.

12:44.900 --> 12:46.980
Let this be a little lesson to you.

12:48.260 --> 12:49.900
Oh.

12:49.900 --> 12:50.940
Oh...

12:50.940 --> 12:52.260
That bit looks important.

12:54.060 --> 12:55.900
CHUCKLES DARKLY

12:58.420 --> 12:59.780
Hang on, hang on.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.780
Do you know how to work that?

13:03.780 --> 13:06.980
It's got lots of different settings,
but yeah.

13:10.940 --> 13:13.420
Thought not.
What the hell just happened?

13:17.300 --> 13:19.220
What the hell is this thing?

13:19.220 --> 13:20.540
It's a wibbly gun.

13:20.540 --> 13:21.780
It makes things go all...

13:23.540 --> 13:24.740
..wibblified.

13:24.740 --> 13:26.980
It appears to destabilise

13:26.980 --> 13:31.020
the molecular structure
of solid objects, sir.

13:31.020 --> 13:34.580
His version was clearer.
Come on. Cargo bay.

13:34.580 --> 13:37.620
Let's get to Blue Midget and CB3.

13:42.940 --> 13:45.460
BEEPING
Rimmer, what is that?

13:45.460 --> 13:48.380
It's a holo-lamp, isn't it, sir?
It plays holo-messages.

13:48.380 --> 13:51.340
My father gave it to me
when I was a boy.

13:51.340 --> 13:53.580
He told me to play it
the day I become an officer

13:53.580 --> 13:56.540
and join the Space Corps,
the day I become a somebody.

13:56.540 --> 13:57.860
So, never been played, right?

13:59.700 --> 14:02.420
And it shan't be until
I'm an officer. Come on, let's go!

14:11.095 --> 14:14.695
Death Ship and three Annihilators
at six o'clock, sirs.

14:17.775 --> 14:19.695
Question. Can we stay ahead
of them?

14:19.695 --> 14:21.935
Only if we have enough fuel, sir.
Two, maybe three hours.

14:21.935 --> 14:25.655
Asteroid field 80 clicks west.
Maybe offer some cover.

14:25.655 --> 14:27.175
I'm taking her in.

14:32.055 --> 14:35.415
According to the readouts,
quadrant two, vector four.

14:35.415 --> 14:37.935
We can hide in that asteroid.
Take us in!

14:43.975 --> 14:48.175
My Dominator, I am afraid
the human insurgents have escaped.

14:48.175 --> 14:50.295
Er, they've flown into
an asteroid field.

14:50.295 --> 14:52.095
That is totally unacceptable!

14:52.095 --> 14:55.575
I agree, My Dominator. The security
forces have been shambolic.

14:55.575 --> 14:58.815
Those responsible should be agonised.
I-I agree also.

14:58.815 --> 14:59.975
And I. And I.

14:59.975 --> 15:01.495
And I. And I also.

15:01.495 --> 15:05.095
Oh, I refuse to be surrounded
by these toadying sycophants!

15:05.095 --> 15:07.895
I agree, My Dominator.
I agree also.

15:07.895 --> 15:09.215
And I. And I.

15:09.215 --> 15:10.615
And I. And I also.

15:10.615 --> 15:13.575
I want each member of my council
to think for themselves,

15:13.575 --> 15:16.135
not just agree with my every word
and whim

15:16.135 --> 15:20.095
out of some pathetic boot-trembling
terror for self-preservation.

15:21.175 --> 15:22.735
Question my judgements!

15:22.735 --> 15:24.455
Debate me, yeah?

15:24.455 --> 15:27.815
Only then will we be truly strong.

15:27.815 --> 15:29.735
Dominator, that simply isn't true.

15:29.735 --> 15:32.215
I mean, the last person to
contradict you was... Kill him.

15:32.215 --> 15:35.135
What?! Do you see what I mean?

15:37.295 --> 15:38.975
Now, find the ship!

15:38.975 --> 15:40.055
Ow...

15:44.215 --> 15:46.575
It appears they've surrounded
the asteroid belt

15:46.575 --> 15:49.095
and are sending in probes
to locate our position.

15:49.095 --> 15:51.535
It's only a matter of time
before they find us.

15:51.535 --> 15:53.295
So, what's our next move?

15:53.295 --> 15:55.535
Shall I go slip into something
more appropriate,

15:55.535 --> 15:56.735
like, say, a coffin?

15:57.815 --> 15:59.935
Is that it? We're all going to die?

15:59.935 --> 16:01.655
Well, YOU'RE all going to die.

16:01.655 --> 16:03.055
I'm already dead.

16:03.055 --> 16:05.855
I had the sense
to get dying out of the way early.

16:05.855 --> 16:09.295
For years, you mocked me.
Not laughing now, are you?

16:09.295 --> 16:12.215
Oh, yeah, cos being dead
is such an advantage here(!)

16:12.215 --> 16:14.815
It is an advantage.
How's it an advantage?

16:14.815 --> 16:19.015
I was killed instantly, Lister -
painless, quick and stylish.

16:19.015 --> 16:20.775
"What's that
coming down the corridor?

16:20.775 --> 16:23.455
"Ooh, it looks like
a radiation leak." Wham, dead.

16:23.455 --> 16:27.415
Not perfect, I'll grant you,
but at least it wasn't embarrassing.

16:27.415 --> 16:30.655
Embarrassing?
No weeping, getting hysterical.

16:30.655 --> 16:31.695
Not one of those deaths

16:31.695 --> 16:33.975
where you lose control
of your bodily functions,

16:33.975 --> 16:36.695
your bowels clearing
all over the place.

16:36.695 --> 16:39.215
At least my death was dignified.

16:39.215 --> 16:42.215
I'd hardly call yelling,
"Mummy, Mummy," dignified.

16:42.215 --> 16:44.135
Lister, I didn't yell,
"Mummy, Mummy."

16:44.135 --> 16:46.615
No, you didn't have the time.
You just yelled, "Mu..."

16:48.495 --> 16:51.575
Please, sirs, this is very bad
for morale. I can't believe

16:51.575 --> 16:54.615
you're arguing about
who's going to have the best death!

16:54.615 --> 16:58.415
I'm only trying to help, give you
some advice on how to die nicely.

16:59.535 --> 17:03.095
You want to die twice, keep talking.
Please, sir!

17:03.095 --> 17:05.135
He's right. We're all getting crazy.

17:05.135 --> 17:06.855
We need to chill.

17:06.855 --> 17:08.055
You're right.

17:08.055 --> 17:10.655
We've been in these situations
before, we always find a way out.

17:10.655 --> 17:13.615
Like the time that highly
corrosive micro-organism

17:13.615 --> 17:15.255
almost destroyed Red Dwarf.

17:15.255 --> 17:17.575
The highly corrosive micro-organism,
exactly!

17:17.575 --> 17:18.974
We got out of that one.

17:18.974 --> 17:20.335
Yeah, thanks to me.

17:20.335 --> 17:22.935
Oh, sir! You cannot claim the credit
for that.

17:22.935 --> 17:24.535
It was a total fluke. Fluke?

17:24.535 --> 17:27.775
You think that was an accident,
the way I...? Ssh!

17:27.775 --> 17:28.975
What's that?

17:31.215 --> 17:33.375
Something's coming into
the asteroid.

17:33.375 --> 17:36.095
It's a probe. It's approaching
half a click east.

17:36.095 --> 17:37.535
Switch out all the lights.

17:38.655 --> 17:40.935
Good thinking!
They'll think we're all out.

17:43.175 --> 17:45.935
If things get really tricky,
we'll get Kryten to open the airlock

17:45.935 --> 17:47.095
and tell 'em we've moved.

17:48.455 --> 17:50.135
It seems to be backing off, sir.

17:50.135 --> 17:51.975
They're coming back.

17:51.975 --> 17:54.775
Look, we've got to get a battleplan -
astro-nav space-school stuff.

17:54.775 --> 17:57.175
Rimmer, is that something
you could handle?

17:57.175 --> 17:58.375
Pardon?

17:58.375 --> 18:00.735
Is that something you can handle?!

18:00.735 --> 18:03.295
The responsibility of coming up with
a battle plan?

18:03.295 --> 18:04.735
All that strategy stuff.

18:04.735 --> 18:06.015
Why me?

18:06.015 --> 18:08.135
Cos you're into military strategy!

18:08.135 --> 18:11.415
If it was a curry-eating competition
to the death, it'd be me.

18:11.415 --> 18:14.055
If it was a towel-folding
competition to the death...

18:14.055 --> 18:15.335
That would be me!

18:15.335 --> 18:17.455
Phuw, phuw,
phuw-phuw-phuw-phuw.

18:17.455 --> 18:18.935
Phuw-phuw-phuw.

18:18.935 --> 18:20.215
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

18:20.215 --> 18:22.095
I'd win that one, sir.

18:22.095 --> 18:23.855
And what kind of competition
to the death

18:23.855 --> 18:25.535
would it have to be
before you chose me?

18:25.535 --> 18:29.015
So, moving on... Er...
Can you do it?

18:29.015 --> 18:30.975
Yes, of course I can do it.

18:30.975 --> 18:32.575
Obviously.

18:32.575 --> 18:34.415
You don't sound very confident.

18:34.415 --> 18:35.975
I'm very confident.

18:35.975 --> 18:37.975
I've waited my whole life
for this moment.

18:37.975 --> 18:41.455
Command of my own ship in a battle
against overwhelming odds?

18:41.455 --> 18:42.935
It's your moment of destiny.

18:42.935 --> 18:45.255
Right. I'll just...

18:45.255 --> 18:49.615
make my way into the...supply room
and think of a plan, then.

18:49.615 --> 18:52.415
It'll be just like taking an exam.

18:52.415 --> 18:54.615
I can do this.

18:57.535 --> 19:00.015
Sir, surely
there must be an alternative.

19:00.015 --> 19:02.695
If there was, Kryten,
we'd be doing it.

19:02.695 --> 19:04.055
ALL: We're smegged.

19:12.855 --> 19:15.175
Any joy, sir?

19:15.175 --> 19:16.695
Not yet, no.

19:16.695 --> 19:19.015
I'm still at the "can't think
of a plan" stage.

19:19.015 --> 19:21.295
Well, I don't know
if this will help, sir,

19:21.295 --> 19:23.175
but I've done a ship-wide search

19:23.175 --> 19:26.015
and collated all the weapons
we have on board ship, sir.

19:26.015 --> 19:28.615
Good, Kryten. I was just about
to suggest that myself.

19:38.495 --> 19:41.215
Two forks and a pencil sharpener?!

19:41.215 --> 19:45.695
Now, there is a rumour that there's
a stick and some string, sir.

19:45.695 --> 19:48.135
But I don't want
to raise false hopes.

19:48.135 --> 19:50.775
There is, of course,
Hogey's molly D.

19:53.215 --> 19:56.055
The molecular destabiliser. Mm.

19:56.055 --> 19:58.055
I'll leave it with you, sir.

20:00.415 --> 20:01.975
Ehh!

20:01.975 --> 20:04.295
They're driving me crazy,
cooped up in there.

20:04.295 --> 20:06.815
Thought I'd take a break
and come in here!

20:08.055 --> 20:10.295
Oww!

20:10.295 --> 20:12.775
I love the string game!

20:12.775 --> 20:14.575
Have you thought of your plan yet?

20:14.575 --> 20:16.855
You can't think of anything,
can you?

20:16.855 --> 20:21.055
I just love the string game!
You know why?

20:21.055 --> 20:22.935
Because you're an idiotic cat?

20:22.935 --> 20:25.775
No. Why you can't think of a plan,
dummy?

20:25.775 --> 20:28.575
Because you're driving me crazy,
that's why. Uh-uh.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.575
There's a demon
messing up your head.

20:30.575 --> 20:32.055
Yes, you! No.

20:32.055 --> 20:33.415
Your father.

20:33.415 --> 20:35.055
My father's dead.

20:35.055 --> 20:36.575
No way, non-bud.

20:36.575 --> 20:39.455
His worthless, skinny ass
lives on inside you,

20:39.455 --> 20:41.615
freezing your soul with fear.

20:44.455 --> 20:46.175
How do you know all this?

20:46.175 --> 20:47.495
Do you think awesome good looks

20:47.495 --> 20:49.335
and rock-hard pecs are
my only qualities?

20:49.335 --> 20:50.655
I'm a cat.

20:50.655 --> 20:52.015
I sense things.

20:52.015 --> 20:55.215
You gotta nail that demon
and kick his sorry ass outta town.

20:55.215 --> 20:57.815
How? The only thing keeping him
alive is you.

20:57.815 --> 20:59.495
You're never going to win over

20:59.495 --> 21:01.575
that dude's approval.
Give it up! Let it go.

21:01.575 --> 21:02.655
Hey!

21:02.655 --> 21:04.215
Look how it's moving!

21:05.655 --> 21:07.415
I lo-ove the string game!

21:08.455 --> 21:10.055
Stop moving!

21:16.495 --> 21:17.735
Anythin'?

21:17.735 --> 21:18.895
Nothing.

21:20.815 --> 21:22.975
What you doing?

21:22.975 --> 21:25.895
I'm going to play this.
Your father's message?

21:25.895 --> 21:27.655
But why, sir?
If I play it

21:27.655 --> 21:30.735
before I've become the person
he wanted me to become,

21:30.735 --> 21:34.295
it means I don't care
what he thinks any more.

21:34.295 --> 21:35.575
It means...

21:35.575 --> 21:36.855
I'm free of him.

21:44.775 --> 21:46.975
Arnold, it's me.

21:46.975 --> 21:49.455
If you're playing this message,
it means

21:49.455 --> 21:51.295
you're an officer
in the Space Corps.

21:51.295 --> 21:52.575
You've achieved your dreams,

21:52.575 --> 21:54.655
you're a man of
significance and substance,

21:54.655 --> 21:56.535
so this won't matter to you now.

21:56.535 --> 21:57.655
Arnold,

21:57.655 --> 21:59.295
I'm not your father.

22:02.735 --> 22:05.455
But that's impossible.
It's not true!

22:05.455 --> 22:07.815
Look inside yourself
and you will know I speak the truth.

22:09.175 --> 22:10.575
Your father wasn't me.

22:10.575 --> 22:12.335
It was Dungo, our gardener.

22:15.775 --> 22:17.815
But he was a babbling imbecile!

22:17.815 --> 22:21.375
A billion-piece jigsaw suddenly
falls into beautiful place.

22:23.095 --> 22:25.255
Know from now on

22:25.255 --> 22:29.175
your family line isn't made up of
Austrian princes and French royalty,

22:29.175 --> 22:33.895
but of lame-brained artisans
and pram-faced trollops.

22:33.895 --> 22:35.935
I didn't tell you before

22:35.935 --> 22:38.215
because I didn't want it
to affect your self-esteem.

22:38.215 --> 22:39.975
But now you've achieved
all your dreams,

22:39.975 --> 22:42.095
it doesn't matter a jot.

22:42.095 --> 22:44.095
Goodbye, Arnold.

22:44.095 --> 22:45.815
And good luck.

22:45.815 --> 22:49.735
PS - naturally, I won't be sending
you any more birthday presents.

23:05.455 --> 23:07.615
This is the worst thing
that can happen.

23:07.615 --> 23:10.655
Mr Rimmer's always had a huge ego
and no self-confidence.

23:10.655 --> 23:14.295
Now his ego's smaller than a pixie's
right nut after an icy bath.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.935
Well, you know, he thought
he came from

23:17.935 --> 23:19.935
a military family, high-flyers,

23:19.935 --> 23:22.375
success ingrained
in the very core of their DNA.

23:22.375 --> 23:24.375
Now he discovers
he's no better than me.

23:25.455 --> 23:26.695
What a nightmare.

23:26.695 --> 23:28.175
RIMMER SIGHS

23:29.255 --> 23:30.895
I think I've got something.

23:30.895 --> 23:32.135
What? How?

23:32.135 --> 23:34.655
I've been thinking.

23:34.655 --> 23:35.975
If Dungo...

23:35.975 --> 23:37.695
I mean Dennis...

23:37.695 --> 23:39.815
I mean Dad...

23:39.815 --> 23:42.055
were here now, he'd be so proud.

23:42.055 --> 23:46.095
Second Technician in the JMC,
senior officer in a mining ship,

23:46.095 --> 23:47.615
and I don't smell of manure.

23:47.615 --> 23:50.975
Suddenly, I don't have
that voice in my head

23:50.975 --> 23:52.855
telling me I'm useless
at everything.

23:52.855 --> 23:55.735
I have a new voice
telling me how proud he is.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.215
I can think,

23:57.215 --> 23:59.175
and I think I've got a plan.

23:59.175 --> 24:00.495
It's crap!

24:00.495 --> 24:04.095
I have to admit, sir,
I'm not entirely convinced myself.

24:04.095 --> 24:06.335
I thought it was quite clever.

24:06.335 --> 24:08.255
Let's take a vote.
Who's against?

24:14.495 --> 24:16.135
'Take a look at this colour.

24:16.135 --> 24:18.135
'Is it purple, blue or green?

24:18.135 --> 24:21.615
'Fallopian tube is a musical
instrument. True or false?

24:21.615 --> 24:23.095
'True?'

24:27.735 --> 24:31.135
It'll work! Jujitsu-style!

24:31.135 --> 24:34.015
Use the might of your opponent
against himself!

24:34.015 --> 24:35.575
Are you quite sure, sir?

24:36.735 --> 24:39.695
We have nothing to fear
but fear itself.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.015
Apart from pain.

24:41.015 --> 24:42.535
And maybe humiliation.

24:42.535 --> 24:44.855
And obviously death and failure.

24:44.855 --> 24:46.375
But apart from fear, pain,

24:46.375 --> 24:49.135
humiliation, failure,
the unknown and death,

24:49.135 --> 24:51.895
we have nothing to fear
but fear itself.

24:52.975 --> 24:54.255
Who's with me?

24:56.375 --> 24:59.375
I know I need to work harder
on that fear speech,

24:59.375 --> 25:01.535
it wasn't quite as rousing
as it should be, but...

25:01.535 --> 25:03.055
we can do this.

25:03.055 --> 25:05.295
He's right! Let's do it.

25:05.295 --> 25:07.775
Let's do it! Come on! Come on!

25:07.775 --> 25:09.735
Get your butts in the air and
let's go! Yeah!

25:09.735 --> 25:11.775
Kryten, bring them forks -
we might need them.

25:16.935 --> 25:18.615
There, My Dominator.

25:18.615 --> 25:20.575
They're emerging from the meteor.
Mm.

25:23.135 --> 25:24.655
How's it looking?
Is it all going to plan?

25:25.735 --> 25:26.975
Nothing in sight, sir.

25:29.095 --> 25:30.255
Oh.

25:39.575 --> 25:41.575
We're surrounded.
Twelve o'clock,

25:41.575 --> 25:43.575
nine o'clock, six o'clock,
three o'clock.

25:43.575 --> 25:45.975
The Death Ship
and three Annihilators.

25:45.975 --> 25:49.255
Keep them in line -
it's absolutely crucial.

25:49.255 --> 25:52.055
Right, open comm channels.
Here goes. Open, sir.

25:53.455 --> 25:55.455
This is Second Technician
Arnold J Rimmer

25:55.455 --> 25:57.495
of the mining ship Red Dwarf.

25:57.495 --> 26:00.175
Under Treaty 5
of the Geneva Convention,

26:00.175 --> 26:02.695
we claim the freedoms and privileges
of prisoners of war.

26:02.695 --> 26:03.775
Ha!

26:03.775 --> 26:05.975
Load the photon mutilators. Mm.

26:05.975 --> 26:08.175
Perhaps you didn't hear me.

26:08.175 --> 26:09.495
We're surrendering.

26:09.495 --> 26:11.895
Mutilators loaded,
Your Excellency.

26:11.895 --> 26:14.735
You can't open fire
on a surrendering ship.

26:14.735 --> 26:18.015
That's a scandalous breach
of the niceties of battle.

26:18.015 --> 26:21.455
All ships, prepare to fire,
on my orders.

26:21.455 --> 26:23.975
Right! You're on report,
m'laddo.

26:25.735 --> 26:27.135
Fire!

26:33.055 --> 26:34.495
Blow us up all you like,

26:34.495 --> 26:37.375
but don't think for one second
you're getting away with it.

26:37.375 --> 26:40.055
A letter worded in the
strongest possible language

26:40.055 --> 26:41.295
is going off to Geneva.

26:41.295 --> 26:43.935
Now, I'm not going to ask you again.

26:43.935 --> 26:45.455
Abort your attack.

26:46.575 --> 26:48.295
Right, that's it.

26:50.855 --> 26:52.375
"Dear sir...

26:52.375 --> 26:56.815
"I was scandalised earlier today
by a Simulant Death Ship

26:56.815 --> 27:01.015
"which contravened Treaty 5
of the Geneva Convention."

27:03.495 --> 27:05.655
Impact - 16 seconds.

27:05.655 --> 27:08.135
It's the way of all things.

27:08.135 --> 27:10.935
You live, you die.

27:10.935 --> 27:13.495
But sometimes you live, you die,

27:13.495 --> 27:15.055
and then you live again.

27:15.055 --> 27:17.655
I know. I've done it myself.

27:17.655 --> 27:18.735
Now!

27:23.735 --> 27:27.215
They've destabilised their
whole ship, all four bulkheads.

27:27.215 --> 27:28.535
LISTER: Look out!

27:38.615 --> 27:41.895
Our own torpedoes
are on a collision course, Sire.

27:44.375 --> 27:47.375
Under Treaty 5
of the Geneva Convention,

27:47.375 --> 27:51.495
we claim the freedoms and privileges
of prisoners of war!

27:51.495 --> 27:53.535
Sorry, I missed that. Pardon?

28:15.455 --> 28:16.575
CHEERING

28:19.615 --> 28:21.815
Good job, sirs.
Hell of a job.

28:21.815 --> 28:23.335
You know what this makes me?

28:23.335 --> 28:25.575
A working-class hero.

28:25.575 --> 28:28.535
Working-class hero,
you and me both.

28:28.535 --> 28:29.935
Kryten...

28:29.935 --> 28:31.775
set a course for Red Dwarf.

28:31.775 --> 28:33.775
The slime's coming home.

28:37.455 --> 28:41.055
♪ It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere

28:41.055 --> 28:44.255
♪ I'm all alone, more or less

28:44.255 --> 28:47.615

29:23.335 --> 29:25.655
What did I tell ya?
We got out of that OK.

29:25.655 --> 29:26.975
Just like we got out of that thing

29:26.975 --> 29:28.855
with the highly corrosive
micro-organism.

29:28.855 --> 29:31.455
Once again, Big Arn saves the day.
Oh, please, sir!

29:31.455 --> 29:33.615
Can we sort this out
once and for all?

29:33.615 --> 29:35.255
Just because you happened...

29:35.255 --> 29:36.855
You kills my brother.

29:39.495 --> 29:40.735
THEY SIGH
