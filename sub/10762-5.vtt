- <i>Tales from the Crypt</i> -

00:11.780 --> 00:14.780
Hey, Roz...  Hi, hi, hi.  
Roz, you just missed the classic prank 
of all time.

00:14.930 --> 00:17.850
- I'll admit it, this was my masterpiece.
- Oh, who, who?  Who'd you get?!
- OK...

00:18.330 --> 00:21.330
- Way to go, Bulldog! 
- There he is!

00:24.630 --> 00:29.150
I got this friend down at 
the impound lot, who came across 
a smashed-up BMW,

00:29.490 --> 00:33.000
- same make and model as Frasier's.
- You didn't!  You got Frasier!

00:33.290 --> 00:36.800
I had his car towed from the garage, 
the wreck went in its place.

00:38.680 --> 00:41.800
The doc totally freaked when 
he saw it.  First, he started 
swearing,

00:42.080 --> 00:45.100
and then he implored the heavens, 
and just when his lip 
started trembling,

00:45.270 --> 00:49.300
- Bulldog comes out, tells him 
it's all a prank.
- Hey, Bulldog observes the mercy rule.

00:50.730 --> 00:52.630
Besides, I got the whole thing 
on tape.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.900
Admit it, Doc, 
I got you good.

01:01.030 --> 01:04.400
Come on, say it: 
"Bulldog's the best!"

01:06.180 --> 01:09.100
OK, OK, how 'bout the bitch dance 
I taught you?

01:11.180 --> 01:13.500
Well, at least give me one up high!
Come on...

01:14.020 --> 01:17.500
oh, come on, don't leave me hanging, 
Doc!  Where's your Halloween spirit?

01:18.780 --> 01:21.100
Don't worry, it'll be here 
waiting for you.

01:24.530 --> 01:27.850
For the record, I knew immediately 
it was not my car.

01:29.200 --> 01:33.050
Mine has a bumper sticker on it 
that says, "I AM PRO OPERA 
AND I VOTE!"

01:34.110 --> 01:37.900
- Frasier, you've got to admit, 
it was clever.
- I admit nothing.

01:38.180 --> 01:41.000
- That is the last we shall discuss 
of it, we have a show to do.
- <i>OK</i>.

01:41.670 --> 01:46.160
Good afternoon, Seattle, 
and welcome to the Halloween edition 
of the Dr. Frasier Crane Show.

01:46.260 --> 01:50.000
Today we will be discussing  
the topic... of fears.

01:50.680 --> 01:55.450
Are they irrational hindrances, 
or evolutionary tools?

01:56.800 --> 01:59.800
Hmmm...  the surprising answer, 
after these words.

02:02.020 --> 02:04.950
<i>My car!  Ohhhh, no - my caaar!</i>

02:05.790 --> 02:08.800
<i>What did they do to you?!</i>  
<i>Oh, my bay-beee...!</i>

02:12.050 --> 02:13.950
Whenever you're ready.

02:19.820 --> 02:22.320
.

02:25.800 --> 02:29.200
- Did you find something?
- Do you think they'll take 
soy sauce packets?

02:30.050 --> 02:34.700
- Who keeps ringing the doorbell?
- Shh!  It's trick or treaters.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.800
- OK, they're gone.
- Well, why didn't you let them in?

02:37.900 --> 02:40.850
Because <i>someone</i> forgot 
to get Halloween candy.

02:41.060 --> 02:44.900
Although, someone else could have 
picked it up since she was already 
in the store.

02:45.230 --> 02:49.500
But, that would override the duty list 
that someone insisted on implementing.

02:50.330 --> 02:53.530
If this is what you two call a fight, 
you're not fit to be married.

02:55.600 --> 02:59.200
- I once held your father's head 
underwater, and...
- Shh!

02:59.950 --> 03:04.100
Oh, for heaven's sake!
We haven't got any candy, shove off!

03:05.960 --> 03:11.410
- Great, now they know we're here.
- That is precisely what's wrong 
with this country,

03:11.610 --> 03:14.350
everyone's afraid to stand up 
to the children.

03:15.700 --> 03:19.380
- Trick-or-treat!
- Didn't you hear?  
We've got no candy!

03:19.480 --> 03:21.580
We can offer you hotel soaps.

03:22.940 --> 03:26.350
But it's Halloween.  
I dress up, you give me candy.

03:26.570 --> 03:30.470
- That costume's supposed 
to be scary?
- No, is yours?

03:33.670 --> 03:36.850
Oh, a nice bite into an onion is 
what that mouth of yours deserves.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.600
If you don't have treats, 
you're going to get a trick.

03:39.710 --> 03:42.200
Do your worst!  
I'm not afraid of you.

03:43.700 --> 03:45.100
Honestly!

03:47.360 --> 03:49.960
OK, well, maybe I'll go get 
some candy after all.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:05.440 --> 04:08.200
OK, I'm going to need my slicker 
and my squash goggles!

04:11.560 --> 04:13.760
.

04:15.090 --> 04:18.459
- Good morning, Roz.  
May I join you?
- Sure, Frasier.

04:18.899 --> 04:20.899
Well, I'm glad to see 
you're not sulking today.

04:21.050 --> 04:24.250
Yes, well, I had a little time 
to think about it, and I've decided 
to put Bulldog's prank

04:24.360 --> 04:28.500
- behind me...
- That's very mature.
- I'm not finished!

04:29.780 --> 04:33.800
...by visiting upon him a prank 
that is ten times more dastardly.  
Look at this.

04:39.020 --> 04:42.000
- Looks like a car 
with a balloon tied to it.
- Precisely.

04:42.070 --> 04:46.650
I will tie a red balloon 
to the antenna of Bulldog's car 
every time his precious Seahawks...

04:46.760 --> 04:48.560
...lose a game.

04:49.620 --> 04:52.720
Over time, the conditioned response 
will become ingrained in his psyche.

04:52.880 --> 04:56.390
Eventually, the mere sight 
of a red balloon...

04:56.990 --> 05:01.400
...will bring about in him 
an inexplicable sense... 

05:03.880 --> 05:06.080
...of loss.
Check-and-mate!

05:08.130 --> 05:10.120
Isn't that... kind of out there?

05:10.220 --> 05:13.600
That's the point.  Well, of course, 
I could go with any one of your 
basic pranks: 

05:13.770 --> 05:17.500
hand in warm water, and whatnot...
Believe me, I have an intimate knowledge 
of all of them.

05:18.040 --> 05:21.440
But what I'm looking for 
is something unmistakably ME.

05:21.970 --> 05:24.700
A signature prank, if you will.

05:24.940 --> 05:28.580
Why don't you just forget 
about revenge and give him 
his two minutes in the sun?

05:28.680 --> 05:31.050
- What, at my expense?
- Look at his life!

05:31.160 --> 05:34.720
You guys used to be equals, 
now he's stuck downstairs 
in that dark,

05:34.820 --> 05:38.790
musty archives room.  
You must have some sympathy for him, 
don't you?

05:38.890 --> 05:42.000
"Dark, musty archives"...  
I think I could use that!

05:43.720 --> 05:45.720
- Hello, all.
- Hello, Niles.

05:45.830 --> 05:49.050
Why do we have to stop here?  
I could make coffee at home.

05:49.620 --> 05:54.750
Now, now, it's good to get out 
of the house, get some fresh air, 
exercise those lungs.

05:55.700 --> 06:00.240
My lungs are as strong as ever.  
Just yesterday, 
I finished a whole cigarette

06:00.340 --> 06:01.940
in two drags.

06:04.150 --> 06:06.150
One off me record!

06:07.770 --> 06:12.000
- What's this?
- I'm devising the ultimate prank, 
to get my revenge on Bulldog.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.400
Ah, well just beware the dangers 
of juvenile one-upsmanship.  

06:15.690 --> 06:19.200
Only last night, Mrs. Moon challenged 
a trick-or-treater, and he responded

06:19.300 --> 06:21.500
by pelting our door with eggs.

06:22.200 --> 06:26.650
Yeah, but I got the little monster 
back, by putting a big, 
greasy glob of Vaseline

06:26.750 --> 06:28.450
on his doorknob!

06:29.560 --> 06:32.950
- You said you'd put an end to it!
- Hence the Vaseline.

06:33.720 --> 06:38.190
- Mum, he's a child!
- Well, it's time he learned 
you don't mess with Gertrude Moon,

06:38.290 --> 06:40.190
without incurring my wrath.

06:41.620 --> 06:44.520
Now, excuse me, 
I require cocoa.

06:46.870 --> 06:50.510
You know, I think she has 
the right attitude.  If I expect 
Bulldog to leave me alone,

06:50.610 --> 06:53.410
I've got to show him that he's dealing 
with a superior intellect.

06:53.510 --> 06:55.510
Show them the balloon car.

07:01.260 --> 07:04.600
I'm sure Da Vinci's early notes 
were full of laughs too!

07:05.150 --> 07:07.550
Excuse me, 
I have devising to do!

07:09.580 --> 07:14.100
- That'll be... $32.03.
- For one drink?!

07:14.520 --> 07:17.550
Your grandson ordered a bunch 
of cakes, and he said it was 
all on you.

07:17.870 --> 07:20.370
Thanks for the treats, Grandma!

07:27.960 --> 07:31.250
Oh, let's see the little sod 
get to school without these.  

07:31.970 --> 07:33.970
Oh, this should settle it!

07:40.190 --> 07:42.490
.

07:45.790 --> 07:47.790
Is anybody there?

07:48.960 --> 07:50.860
Oh, zombies...

07:51.310 --> 07:54.650
the living dead.  
Help, help!

07:56.340 --> 07:58.240
Everyone, hold please.

08:01.090 --> 08:04.750
- Zombie Number Two, 
what are you doing?
- I'm scaring Bulldog?

08:05.890 --> 08:07.390
I see.

08:08.700 --> 08:11.350
Is that what zombies do, 
they scare people?

08:12.160 --> 08:13.460
- Um...
- Wrong.

08:14.030 --> 08:17.150
They eat brains, 
and THAT'S what scares people.

08:18.950 --> 08:21.800
Now, look, this is our dress 
rehearsal, let's please try 
to get this right.

08:22.210 --> 08:26.400
Bulldog comes in, he hears noises, 
zombies go after his brain,

08:28.100 --> 08:31.900
and his terror is caught on videotape 
for us all to enjoy at a later date.

08:32.809 --> 08:34.809
Now, let's try this again.  
First marks, please.

08:34.950 --> 08:38.490
Oh, jeez, Fras, this is the fourth 
time through.  Can somebody else 
play Bulldog now?

08:38.590 --> 08:41.640
- Dad, you said you would help me with this.
- Well, that's because you said 
we were gonna do a practical joke.

08:41.760 --> 08:44.560
- I thought it would be fun.
- Whatever gave you that idea?

08:46.480 --> 08:50.400
Todd, I am getting "dead" from you.

08:51.250 --> 08:53.450
But I am not getting "undead."

08:55.220 --> 08:56.720
Still?

08:58.930 --> 09:00.740
Let's try this then.

09:00.850 --> 09:04.300
After rehearsal, I want each of you 
to write a paragraph

09:05.720 --> 09:09.850
detailing who your character was 
when he or she was alive,

09:11.680 --> 09:13.080
how they died,

09:13.190 --> 09:15.670
and why they're now 
after Bulldog's brain.  

09:16.760 --> 09:20.350
Honestly, Roz, you know, you haven't 
given me much to work With here.  
These are the worst actors I've ever seen.

09:20.950 --> 09:24.350
Well, I'm sorry, but the Royal 
Zombie Company just left town

09:24.450 --> 09:26.850
with its all-zombie production 
of "Hamlet"!

09:29.320 --> 09:33.390
- How many more times are we going 
to do this?
- Why is it that whenever Bulldog 

09:33.500 --> 09:37.600
pulls off a practical joke, 
you all applaud him, as if he'd won 
some sort of bowl or cup 

09:37.700 --> 09:39.880
or other sports dish?

09:39.980 --> 09:42.480
But when I ask you to give up 
a single Sunday, 
all I get is complaints?

09:42.590 --> 09:45.570
Well, because you keep turning it 
into work!  
This is supposed to be fun!

09:45.760 --> 09:49.030
Like a day at the beach!  
Oh, you do this kind of thing 
all the time.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.730
- Like when?
- Well, the last time we went 
to the beach!

09:53.290 --> 09:55.590
A lot of people bring rakes!

09:58.030 --> 10:01.620
Look, Frasier, it's not too late 
to back out of this.  
Face it,

10:01.820 --> 10:04.500
- jokes just aren't your specialty.
- What is that supposed to mean?

10:04.600 --> 10:07.700
Well, what she means, son, 
is that we all have 
our different blessings.

10:08.190 --> 10:10.950
And Bulldog's good at jokes 
and fun, and you're good at...

10:12.090 --> 10:16.010
...reading, and, uh... telling 
people about the things you read.

10:17.150 --> 10:20.540
- Are you saying that you think 
I can't pull this off?
- Oh, I wouldn't put it that way.

10:20.640 --> 10:24.240
- I would.
- But I've worked this out 
to the last detail,

10:24.360 --> 10:27.460
- nothing can go wrong!
- Everything's gonna go wrong!

10:27.650 --> 10:30.990
For one thing, Bulldog's gonna 
know something's up, 
'cause Kenny hardly ever

10:31.090 --> 10:35.220
makes him work at night!  And then 
look at all these cameras and wires.
I mean, what if he spots these?

10:35.420 --> 10:38.560
And the zombies, as soon as he sees 
them, he's gonna know it's a prank,

10:38.660 --> 10:42.160
because he just pranked you!
And there are no such things 
as zombies!!!

10:51.310 --> 10:53.110
You, sir...

10:53.700 --> 10:55.400
are released!

10:56.990 --> 10:58.690
And you as well! 

10:59.800 --> 11:02.650
I'll pull this thing off by myself, 
proving you don't know 
what you're talking about!

11:03.200 --> 11:05.010
I don't need any of you!

11:05.110 --> 11:07.010
Wait, zombies, 
I do need you!

11:07.650 --> 11:09.250
But no one else!

11:09.620 --> 11:14.450
I'll show all of you!  
You mark my words, tomorrow night 
I get my revenge!

11:18.920 --> 11:21.750
Ah, good, the effects machine's 
working again.  All right...

11:22.520 --> 11:24.520
everyone, back to your 
first marks.

11:29.600 --> 11:33.200
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry, I had a hard time 
finding this place.

11:33.520 --> 11:38.150
I checked the directory for "Crane," 
but it had "Old Bat" next to 
this apartment number.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.090
A little obvious, 
but not bad.

11:43.410 --> 11:47.850
I want you to deliver 
this "Baby-I-Have-To-Tinkle" doll

11:48.850 --> 11:52.550
to Jason White, 
Floyd Middle School.

11:52.990 --> 11:57.130
This is the address.  I mean, 
he should be in gym class about now.

11:59.010 --> 12:03.800
- I don't think I'm allowed to 
just walk into his school, ma'am.
- No, it's OK.  I'm his grandmother.

12:04.380 --> 12:06.180
And you have to say this.

12:06.370 --> 12:09.450
"Your mommy said, bring this to you 
at school to lift your spirits.

12:10.590 --> 12:13.190
See?  
A dolly has accidents too."

12:14.960 --> 12:18.330
- You really want me to say that?
- Yes, and very loudly.

12:18.430 --> 12:20.630
The poor thing's hard-of-hearing.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.420
Yes!

12:27.200 --> 12:29.300
.

12:30.140 --> 12:34.250
Todd, take off that baseball cap.

12:35.110 --> 12:37.200
You're undead, not uncouth.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.340
All right, everyone, 
step lively,

12:41.900 --> 12:43.500
look sharp.

12:43.610 --> 12:48.550
It's almost showtime.  
Give me a final room tone check, 
please, and... take your marks.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.100
Hey, Fras.

12:51.590 --> 12:52.990
Well... hello.

12:53.680 --> 12:57.710
- You've come to watch me fail, 
I suppose.
- No, we just want to come join you.

12:57.810 --> 13:01.790
- Yeah, we're sorry about that 
stuff we said yesterday.
- Yeah, we came to see you have your day.

13:01.890 --> 13:05.480
- It's long overdue.
- Maybe I don't want you here.

13:06.870 --> 13:09.380
- What do you mean?
- You abandon me in my hour 
of need,

13:09.480 --> 13:13.090
now you're here to revel in 
my success, just like in Boswell's 
"Life of Johnson."

13:14.840 --> 13:18.220
- What?
- It was something-I-read.

13:21.170 --> 13:24.250
I guess we deserved that - 
whatever the hell it means.

13:25.820 --> 13:29.500
Come on, Frasier, we're sorry.  
Just let us watch.

13:30.010 --> 13:34.700
All right, apology accepted.  
You may observe - in silence.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.080
Make yourselves comfortable.  

13:37.380 --> 13:42.400
And prepare to witness a man 
brought to the very edge 
of madness!

13:46.040 --> 13:48.100
I think he's already there.

13:52.520 --> 13:56.300
- Mum, we're off to the symphony.
- Haven't the Germans 
punished us enough?

13:58.600 --> 13:59.900
Oh! Bloody hell!

14:00.380 --> 14:05.000
- Where did this come from?
- Oh, you must have crossed someone.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.100
Mother...

14:10.010 --> 14:13.690
Oh my God!  I'm so sorry!  
We were just coming down the hall, 
and we saw you open your door.

14:13.790 --> 14:16.280
- This is our trash can!
- What was it doing there?

14:16.380 --> 14:18.080
Jason, get back here!

14:18.370 --> 14:22.000
It seems our children have been 
feuding.  We're very embarrassed.

14:22.310 --> 14:24.410
You're embarrassed?  
Meet our daughter!

14:29.260 --> 14:30.560
Hello!

14:31.730 --> 14:33.830
- I have a lot of homework...
- Stay!

14:34.090 --> 14:37.470
- Jason, have you been fighting 
with this woman?
- Well, she broke my bike

14:37.580 --> 14:40.150
and made me have to see 
a counselor at school!

14:42.600 --> 14:45.150
- I think I left something 
in the kitchen... 
- Stay!

14:45.880 --> 14:48.580
I am an adult!  
I can do anything I want!

14:49.610 --> 14:53.010
No.  While you're living 
under our roof, you'll follow 
our rules.

14:54.700 --> 14:57.990
You two should be ashamed of 
yourselves.  What if someone 
got hurt?

14:58.090 --> 15:03.200
- Good.
- Jason! You are one step away from 
losing your broadband connection.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.400
Now apologize and shake hands.

15:10.640 --> 15:13.850
What if I told you you couldn't 
smoke your pipes in your room 
anymore?

15:15.520 --> 15:16.820
(both)
I'm sorry.

15:18.420 --> 15:22.550
- Now, you two are going 
to clean up this mess.
- And Jason, come straight home 
when you're finished.

15:23.070 --> 15:25.770
And this place better be spotless 
by the time we get back.

15:29.580 --> 15:33.750
I wish I was all grown-up, 
and I wouldn't have to follow 
their stupid rules!

15:34.060 --> 15:36.460
Oh, nothing changes, trust me.

15:40.170 --> 15:44.750
You know... my mom hates bugs.  
She screams like a girl.

15:45.690 --> 15:47.590
So does my son-in-law!

15:49.480 --> 15:54.500
- I know where we can find 
some crickets.
- No! Now, we should do as we're told,

15:54.680 --> 15:56.880
- and start cleaning up.
- Ok.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.200
That way, they won't be 
expecting it!

16:04.890 --> 16:07.690
.

16:08.470 --> 16:11.500
This is so great!  I can't wait!  
I'm getting goose bumps! 

16:11.600 --> 16:13.200
Feel me, feel me!

16:15.330 --> 16:18.830
Kenny, what was the condition 
of my letting you watch?

16:22.440 --> 16:23.740
There he is.

16:24.420 --> 16:27.420
Cue creaking noise one...

16:33.140 --> 16:35.840
Hello?  Who's there?

16:36.790 --> 16:38.890
Cue creaking noise two.

16:45.530 --> 16:48.230
Now, let the horror begin...

16:52.910 --> 16:56.310
Yes!  How do you like that, 
ya big baby!

17:00.750 --> 17:02.250
Get back!

17:04.119 --> 17:08.750
OH MY GOD!  OH MY GOD!
CALL 9-1-1, CALL 9-1-1!

17:12.970 --> 17:16.230
- Don't worry about it, Kenny!  
It's just a joke!
- What are you talking about?!

17:16.329 --> 17:20.050
- It's a fake gun!
- What?
- It's-a-fake-gun!

17:20.579 --> 17:22.079
What about the bullets?

17:23.930 --> 17:25.380
It's a joke!

17:25.480 --> 17:29.080
Bulldog found out about Frasier's 
prank, so we set him up!

17:30.270 --> 17:33.190
That is awesome!  I can't believe 
he fell for it!

17:33.640 --> 17:36.440
- Come on, we got to go tell 
Frasier what's going on!
- You guys go ahead...

17:36.540 --> 17:38.540
I think I'm gonna stay here 
and puke.

17:42.750 --> 17:44.950
Stop!  Stop!  
It was all a joke!

17:45.210 --> 17:47.610
Oh my God, 
what have I done?!

17:48.560 --> 17:51.060
What's the big deal, 
he was already a zombie!

17:52.140 --> 17:54.240
Are you insane?!  
Call an ambulance!

18:02.780 --> 18:06.450
- What is going on here?
- Wave to the camera, Frasier!

18:06.710 --> 18:10.950
- What?
- Got you again, all on tape.  
Who's the king?

18:12.410 --> 18:15.980
- That isn't funny, 
I could have had a heart attack!
- Oh, sorry, Fras,

18:16.080 --> 18:19.550
- we just couldn't resist.
- Well, at least nobody was hurt.

18:19.830 --> 18:22.200
You bested me, Bulldog, again!

18:22.600 --> 18:25.350
- Dr. Crane, I think 
I hurt my back...
- What?

18:27.050 --> 18:29.650
- OH MY GOD!!!
- WHAT HAVE WE DONE?!
- SOMEONE CALL AN AMBULANCE!

18:29.990 --> 18:31.810
WHERE'S THE PHONE?!  
WHERE'S THE PHONE?!

18:31.910 --> 18:36.310
- Roz, get the first aid kit 
out of the closet!
- OK! OK!
- No, no, not the...!

18:39.290 --> 18:42.300
- WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON 
DOWN HERE?!?!
- Quiet, quiet, everybody!

18:42.610 --> 18:47.500
Hello?  Yes, I'd like to report... 
THE GREATEST PRACTICAL JOKE EVER!

18:48.790 --> 18:52.290
You'd better send a fire truck, 
because you guys just got BURNED!

18:58.830 --> 19:01.030
- AH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HAAAAAA!
- Wait, what?!
- Hi, Roz!

19:04.970 --> 19:09.400
You should see the look on your 
faces!  This is truly a classic!

19:09.560 --> 19:12.900
- This was all just a joke?
- Awesome!

19:17.330 --> 19:19.830
- Nice work, Doc.
- Likewise, Bulldog.

19:21.090 --> 19:24.090
- You think I can get a copy 
of this for my demo reel?
- Sure thing, Todd.

19:24.880 --> 19:27.180
You've come a long way 
in a short time, young man.

19:29.340 --> 19:32.220
Well, Frasier, I'm speechless!
You totally had us going!

19:32.320 --> 19:36.330
- I can't believe it!
- Admit it, Roz, can I pull off 
a practical joke, or what?

19:36.430 --> 19:40.280
- I just don't understand it, 
you guys worked together?
- Yeah, Frasier set the whole thing up.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.920
The other day, after you two left, 
I got to thinking maybe my joke 

19:43.020 --> 19:45.020
was aimed at the wrong target.

19:45.860 --> 19:49.670
- That's when Bulldog and I 
joined forces!
- But we joined forces with him 

19:49.780 --> 19:52.900
- ...to get you!
- That's exactly what you were 
supposed to think!

19:53.960 --> 19:57.700
- Wow, Fras, I got to give it 
to you - this was brilliant!
- Thank you, Dad.

19:57.940 --> 20:00.240
What do you say we all go upstairs 
and watch the tape, huh?

20:01.530 --> 20:06.930
- All right, you guys go ahead.  
Bulldog?
- Yeah?

20:07.130 --> 20:11.050
- Technically, I still owe you one.
- Face it, Doc, you will never win.

20:16.170 --> 20:18.400
Good work, Noel.  ...That's why 
you had to join forces with me.

20:19.520 --> 20:20.820
Huh?

20:22.280 --> 20:24.800
- You're right.
- All right.
