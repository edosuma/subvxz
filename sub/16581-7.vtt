[kettle whistling]

00:10.803 --> 00:13.135
What are you doing over there?
You look like a frat boy.

00:14.390 --> 00:16.255
I'm installing
a security system.

00:16.476 --> 00:17.932
Somebody tries to come
through the door,

00:18.144 --> 00:19.259
they knock the cans over.

00:20.229 --> 00:21.605
| just want you
to feel safe.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.686
-I do.
-You sure?

00:27.320 --> 00:30.528
Look, what happened
with Tamar --

00:30.740 --> 00:32.605
lt -- It was --
It was a lot,

00:32.825 --> 00:35.407
and I don't think
that we should try to pretend

00:35.620 --> 00:37.326
it didn't happen
or anything,

00:37.538 --> 00:41.122
but l-l think we also both know
that she's not gonna come back.

00:41.334 --> 00:44.497
Sure. But I've poked some other
hornets' nests over the years.

00:45.338 --> 00:46.703
You can't be too careful.

00:47.882 --> 00:52.216
But, uh, well,
if you're okay,

00:53.179 --> 00:56.671
maybe it's time to, you know,
get back on the horse.

00:58.768 --> 00:59.427
Um...

01:00.394 --> 01:06.560
Not that you're the horse
in, um, that particular metaphor

01:06.776 --> 01:10.985
or that, um...
I'm going to get on --

01:11.197 --> 01:12.107
-Okay, okay.
-Yeah.

01:12.323 --> 01:13.529
It's okay, cowboy.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.323
Um, seeing as how
you've installed

01:16.536 --> 01:19.494
a security system
for me and all,

01:19.705 --> 01:23.323
um, maybe it's time
we should just...

01:30.049 --> 01:31.038
Wait.

01:36.806 --> 01:37.716
Oh.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.136
[chuckles]
I'm back.

01:46.148 --> 01:47.274
Come here.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.394
Oh.

01:55.575 --> 01:56.690
[gunshoﬂ
0h!

01:58.786 --> 01:59.946
Are you okay?

02:01.372 --> 02:03.363
Yep.
[clears throat]

02:08.296 --> 02:09.502
[sighs]

02:11.007 --> 02:12.292
There's something
about this room

02:13.551 --> 02:15.337
that kind of kills
the mood.

02:15.845 --> 02:16.755
Yep.

02:18.180 --> 02:19.260
[exhales deeply]

02:22.268 --> 02:24.680
You know what I used to do
when l was a teenager?

02:26.355 --> 02:29.017
[engine shuts off]

02:29.233 --> 02:30.689
This is silly.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.893
I mean, it's beautiful,
and it's very sweet, but...

02:34.113 --> 02:35.068
Wait.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.030
What --
What are you doing?

02:38.659 --> 02:41.150
[laughing]
A cassette?

02:41.370 --> 02:43.281
-A cassette tape?
-Yeah.

didn't you?

02:52.423 --> 02:53.253
[both laugh]

02:53.466 --> 02:54.751
Wow.

02:55.676 --> 02:56.586
Mm.

02:57.637 --> 02:59.002
I'll take my coat off.

02:59.221 --> 03:02.463
-Here, um...
-Pu|l that off.

03:02.683 --> 03:03.843
J‘J‘ Well, I take whatever I want J‘J‘
Yeah. I got it.

03:04.060 --> 03:06.676

Okay, there we go.

for you J‘J‘

J‘J‘ Come on, come on,
come on and do it J‘J‘

03:22.328 --> 03:24.364
Okay. Oh, wait.

03:24.580 --> 03:25.740
I think I hit
the gear shift.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.743
That's not the gear shift.
[both laugh]

03:28.959 --> 03:30.335

If I try to...
Oh, okay.

-Ow. Okay, okay. Okay.
-Uh-oh.

03:36.258 --> 03:38.840
[laughing] Don't say that.
That doesn't sound good.

03:39.053 --> 03:41.795
Walt, you're taking my...
[laughs]

-J‘J‘ I can't get enough
of your love J‘J‘

[gasps] Shit!

04:18.426 --> 04:19.711
[exhales sharply]

04:20.469 --> 04:22.505
[sighs]
Hi, Ms. Longmire.

04:24.140 --> 04:26.301
So, did you give J.P.
the restraining order?

04:26.892 --> 04:27.881
Idid.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.227
How, uh, did he take it?

04:32.440 --> 04:36.274
I gave it to him at work,
so he was, you know, reserved.

04:37.361 --> 04:39.477
Asha, have you
been sleeping here?

04:40.573 --> 04:42.734
Well, you didn't tell me
where l was supposed to go.

04:44.702 --> 04:46.442
Oh, Asha, I'm --
I'm so sorry.

04:46.662 --> 04:49.028
| just assumed you'd stay
with family or friends.

04:49.248 --> 04:50.988
But J.P. knows
where they all live.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.197
He'd come and find me.

04:52.418 --> 04:53.703
He's not supposed to.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.035
That's why we gave him
the restraining order.

04:56.255 --> 04:57.756
J.P. knows that if
he tries anything,

04:57.965 --> 05:00.923
even just coming to see you,
he can be arrested.

05:01.135 --> 05:02.545
You think that'll stop him?

05:05.848 --> 05:07.884
Okay, um, why don't
you come inside?

05:08.559 --> 05:09.890
We'll get you something
to eat.

05:11.479 --> 05:14.596
You can rest a little
until we figure something out.

05:17.109 --> 05:18.724
Do you have
a suitcase or...

05:18.944 --> 05:19.854
No, l...

05:21.989 --> 05:26.858
I didn't bring anything
except what I'm wearing.

05:28.871 --> 05:32.580
It's gonna be okay.
Okay, Asha?

05:33.876 --> 05:36.288
I'll stop by your place later
and pick up some of your things

05:36.504 --> 05:38.085
while J.P.‘s at work.

05:45.012 --> 05:48.425
[Walt] Sheriff's department.
You guys call?

05:48.808 --> 05:51.390
[Jim]
Okay. First things first.

05:51.894 --> 05:53.930
If it is underneath him or her,
we get it.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.522
Hey, we should pay him
a finder's fee for his help.

05:55.731 --> 05:58.393
-That just seems right.
-Okay, fine, but we solved it.

05:58.609 --> 06:00.099
I need you to
agree to that, Sheriff.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.560
I understand you found
something.

06:02.780 --> 06:04.111
Well, we're hoping
we found something.

06:04.323 --> 06:05.688
We definitely found
someone.

06:05.908 --> 06:07.614
He's dead.
Or she.

06:07.827 --> 06:08.566
Where?

06:12.623 --> 06:14.238
You found a dead body
up in that tree?

06:14.458 --> 06:15.959
-No, down in that tree.
-|t's hollow.

06:16.168 --> 06:17.499
-Show him the video.
-Oh, yeah.

06:18.337 --> 06:19.998
Hold on.
[chuckles] Hold on.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.704
You two seem happy
about this.

06:21.924 --> 06:23.164
That's because
if there's a body in there,

06:23.384 --> 06:24.715
then we're definitely right.

06:25.636 --> 06:27.922
-About what?
-Anson Hamilton's treasure.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.720
-You heard about that, right?
-Nope.

06:31.392 --> 06:33.474
So, this rich guy in Missouri --
Yeah, he buried a treasure,

06:33.686 --> 06:36.098
then he wrote a poem
full of -- of -- of clues

06:36.313 --> 06:37.564
about where
he buried it, okay,

06:37.773 --> 06:39.354
and then put that poem
on the Internet.

06:39.567 --> 06:40.807
You have that poem?

06:41.026 --> 06:43.813
Oh, we have the
whole damn thing memorized.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.235
The key couplet reads,

06:45.406 --> 06:47.647
"To the Absarokas,
past hill and hollow,

06:47.867 --> 06:49.823
search for a place
no man can follow."

06:52.329 --> 06:53.284
This is Absaroka County.

06:53.497 --> 06:56.204
That tree is definitely a hollow
where no man can follow.

06:56.417 --> 06:57.748
Okay, here it is. Wait.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.372
So, we climbed up
and we dropped a GoPro down,

07:00.588 --> 07:01.794
and this is what we saw.

07:04.550 --> 07:05.585
You see that hair?

07:06.302 --> 07:08.463
That's human hair.
That's got to be a human head.

07:08.679 --> 07:10.465
This guy must have
solved the poem before us

07:10.681 --> 07:13.423
and he went down to get the
treasure and couldn't get out.

07:19.356 --> 07:20.641
So, how you gonna get him out,
Sheriff?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.290
Stopped by
that new bagel place.

07:38.042 --> 07:39.748
Finally a bit of
civilization here.

07:41.003 --> 07:42.539
Did you want lox on yours?

07:42.755 --> 07:43.744
No, thanks.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.336
[Ferg]
So,whathappened?

07:45.925 --> 07:47.631
Someone got stuck
exploring the tree?

07:48.260 --> 07:49.124
Let's go see.

07:49.345 --> 07:51.461
Hey, is there anything else
under him?

07:52.181 --> 07:53.887
-|'m going up.
-No, you're not.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.760
Back up.
Let us do our job.

07:56.352 --> 07:59.094
[indistinct conversations]

08:01.065 --> 08:04.057
Whoever this is,
he's been in there awhile.

08:05.027 --> 08:06.016
Practically a mummy.

08:06.695 --> 08:08.481
How long ago was that poem
pubHshed?

08:08.697 --> 08:10.153
About three years ago.

08:10.366 --> 08:12.106
If this guy
was looking for the treasure,

08:12.743 --> 08:14.153
wouldn't there be
some old ropes?

08:14.954 --> 08:16.194
How else
could he have gotten in?

08:17.164 --> 08:18.620
Maybe he was working
with a partner.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.788
Once the partner got
the treasure, he abandoned him.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.789
How does anybody know that
tree's hollow to begin with?

08:25.005 --> 08:26.870
Well, we talked to some guys
at the Forest Service,

08:27.091 --> 08:28.422
one of those hotshot
firefighters.

08:28.634 --> 08:30.750
Tom, don't give away
our secrets.

08:33.097 --> 08:35.008
[man] Hey.
Got something else here.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.679
It's just a big canvas bag.

08:42.231 --> 08:44.096
He was probably gonna put
the treasure in it.

08:44.316 --> 08:46.693
-Anything else in there?
-No, that's it.

08:46.902 --> 08:48.187
Look again!

08:50.364 --> 08:54.152
Okay, so there's no treasure,
no wallet on the body.

08:54.368 --> 08:57.155
I guess the only way
to LB. someone that's this dead

08:57.371 --> 08:58.952
is gonna be dental records.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.790
Maybe there's another way.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.205
[Ferg]
Is that a tattoo?

09:06.422 --> 09:07.628
[Vic]
Does it say something?

09:08.340 --> 09:09.420
"Tizz."

09:09.633 --> 09:10.918
What's that mean?

09:12.094 --> 09:13.709
It means
I know who to talk to.

09:37.578 --> 09:38.283
[answering machine beeps]

09:38.912 --> 09:41.324
[J.P.]
Uh, hello. Uh, Ms. Longmire?

09:41.540 --> 09:43.201
This is J.P. Wright.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.290
I need you to call me.

09:46.628 --> 09:47.834
I love Asha.

09:48.964 --> 09:51.501
And l...miss her so much.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.584
And I want to know
what I got to do

09:54.803 --> 09:57.419
to get you to rip up
that court order.

09:57.639 --> 10:00.631
So call me, please.

10:02.519 --> 10:06.103
And tell Asha...l'm sorry.

10:08.192 --> 10:11.525
[vehicle approaching]

10:11.737 --> 10:13.318
[Vic]
This is one long driveway.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.145
These people must be loaded.

10:15.783 --> 10:16.613
[Walt]
Yeah.

10:17.659 --> 10:18.785
[clears throat]

10:20.496 --> 10:22.077
[coughs]

10:30.005 --> 10:30.960
You okay?

10:34.051 --> 10:35.587
I didn't sleep much
last night.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.130
You stressed
about the civil suit?

10:38.972 --> 10:39.677
No.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.422
No. That's going away.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.679
I decided to settle
the case.

10:44.895 --> 10:45.930
Wow.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.395
So unlike you.

10:49.066 --> 10:49.851
Yeah.

10:50.609 --> 10:53.271
Well, uh, that way,
neither of us has to worry

10:53.487 --> 10:56.979
about all that stuff
in your deposition coming out.

10:58.659 --> 10:59.899
Right.

11:01.787 --> 11:05.746
[clears throat]
So, um, you know this Tizz well?

11:05.958 --> 11:08.745
Not well. I met her once
seven years ago.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.747
She must have made
quite the impression.

11:11.964 --> 11:13.704
Well, her father
had just died.

11:13.924 --> 11:15.710
That kind of thing
sticks with you.

11:20.806 --> 11:22.091
[knock on door]

11:24.810 --> 11:25.925
No, thank you,
Mrs. Crandall.

11:27.646 --> 11:29.147
I'm, uh,
feeling a little queasy.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.312
Yeah, me too.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.522
No offense, Sheriff,

11:33.735 --> 11:36.021
but I just have bad associations
with you showing up here.

11:36.655 --> 11:37.690
I understand.

11:38.448 --> 11:39.824
So, what can we
help you with?

11:41.076 --> 11:44.739
l have some questions
about your nickname -- Tizz.

11:45.664 --> 11:47.200
Um, okay.

11:47.875 --> 11:48.785
Where did it come from?

11:49.334 --> 11:51.040
I got it in college.

11:51.253 --> 11:52.834
There were lots
of Elizabeths.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.037
Uh, one of my roommates
just started calling me "Tizz"

11:55.257 --> 11:56.542
to set me apart.

11:56.758 --> 11:57.838
lt stuck.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.383
Anybody ever get a tattoo
of your name?

12:02.014 --> 12:03.595
Why are you asking me
about this?

12:04.474 --> 12:06.635
So you do know someone
with a tattoo?

12:07.394 --> 12:08.304
My husband.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.476
What happened?
Did Tony do something?

12:10.689 --> 12:11.724
[Vic]
[clears throat]

12:12.399 --> 12:13.559
Tony's your husband?

12:13.775 --> 12:14.981
-Yes.
-No.

12:15.194 --> 12:16.900
Not anymore, that little shit.

12:17.112 --> 12:18.522
Mom, please.

12:19.907 --> 12:20.942
So you're divorced?

12:21.158 --> 12:24.571
-No, separated.
-We|l, that's a technicality.

12:24.786 --> 12:27.198
Tony abandoned her two
years ago out of the blue

12:27.414 --> 12:29.075
without leaving a note
or anything.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.373
That's not true.
He wrote.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.621
[scoffs]
Months later.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.668
When is the last time
you heard from Tony?

12:36.715 --> 12:37.921
Four months ago.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.089
He's been living in Colorado --
uh, Pagosa Springs.

12:40.302 --> 12:42.418
He's a --
He's a river rafting guide.

12:42.638 --> 12:44.674
[scoffs]
Prince Charming wrote to say

12:44.890 --> 12:48.257
that he had met someone else,
that he's moved on.

12:48.477 --> 12:52.470
So, uh, where exactly
did Tony get your name tattooed?

12:59.529 --> 13:01.065
Why are you asking me this?

13:02.908 --> 13:04.068
What's happened?

13:09.623 --> 13:10.373
No.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.662
I'm so sorry, Tizz.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.383
Mrs. Crandall,
I'm really sorry

13:27.599 --> 13:29.339
to be the bearer of bad news
again.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.395
You know, I couldn't say this
in front of my daughter,

13:32.604 --> 13:36.597
but frankly, we're all better
off with Tony Kaufman gone.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.020
So you were not a fan.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.648
Did other people feel
that way?

13:42.239 --> 13:43.354
About Tony?

13:43.573 --> 13:44.733
[chuckles]

13:44.950 --> 13:46.156
Everybody loved Tony.

13:46.368 --> 13:47.824
He was the life
of the party

13:48.036 --> 13:50.448
until anything went
the least bit wrong,

13:50.664 --> 13:53.030
and then he'd
just disappear.

13:53.959 --> 13:55.995
Did he ever mention
a treasure hunt?

13:57.879 --> 13:59.961
Somebody hid a treasure
out in the wilderness.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.959
I guess people are out there
looking for it.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.382
lwouldn't be surprised
if he went after it.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.004
The promise of easy money

14:06.221 --> 14:08.428
was just the kind of thing
he'd get excited about.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.764
Your daughter said she got a
letter from him four months ago.

14:11.977 --> 14:13.217
Did you ever hear from him?

14:13.437 --> 14:15.598
I tried calling him
a couple of times,

14:15.814 --> 14:17.805
you know, to give him
a piece of my mind.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.516
He never answered.
Never called back.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.731
Do you know if your daughter
still has that letter Tony sent?

14:23.947 --> 14:25.528
It might help shed
some light on this.

14:25.741 --> 14:28.357
l shredded it
for her own good.

14:28.577 --> 14:31.910
Two years, and she's still
mooning over him.

14:41.923 --> 14:42.673
[engine shuts off]

15:07.741 --> 15:08.605
Hi.

15:10.035 --> 15:11.366
ls A-Asha with you?

15:11.578 --> 15:13.318
Um, no.
She's not.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.870
-But you got my message.
-Uh, yes, I did.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.573
So are you gonna take back
that restraining order?

15:17.793 --> 15:19.875
It doesn't work
like that, J.P.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.794
I know.
Look, I know I screwed up.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.293
And I want --
I want to make things right.

15:27.052 --> 15:28.508
Can you please help me?

15:30.013 --> 15:31.844
Could I use your
bathroom first?

15:34.768 --> 15:36.008
Yeah. Sure.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.389
Come on in.

15:46.613 --> 15:47.853
Bath room's that way.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.121
Could I also bother you
for a glass of water?

15:56.289 --> 15:57.540
Yeah. Sure.

15:57.749 --> 15:58.989
Thanks.

16:46.047 --> 16:46.911
Here's your water.

16:48.258 --> 16:49.998
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.751
See? I'm not such
a bad guy.

16:54.055 --> 16:56.546
J.P., I could tell from your
message

16:56.766 --> 16:59.849
that you don't really appreciate
the seriousness

17:00.061 --> 17:01.221
of this protective order.

17:01.438 --> 17:04.054
It's very important
for both of your sakes

17:04.274 --> 17:06.230
that you do not try
and contact Asha right now.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.809
So what do l have to do to prove
I'm not a bad guy?

17:09.321 --> 17:10.777
I mean,
s-should | write a letter?

17:11.323 --> 17:14.486
That's a good idea,
but this is gonna take time.

17:15.494 --> 17:16.904
Okay.
How long?

17:18.163 --> 17:19.152
I don't know.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.218
Thank you.

17:41.144 --> 17:43.681
Are you leaving?
You just got here. What...

17:44.689 --> 17:45.895
Why'd you really come?

17:46.399 --> 17:49.141
I got your message, and I wanted
to be very clear with you

17:49.361 --> 17:51.443
what you can and
cannot do legally.

17:52.489 --> 17:53.444
Hey, just tell me.

17:54.866 --> 17:56.151
Where is she?

17:56.618 --> 17:57.949
Where is my wife?

17:58.787 --> 18:01.119
I'm sorry, J.P.
I cannot tell you that.

18:05.085 --> 18:05.915
[door closes]

18:09.506 --> 18:11.212
[J.P.] Shit!
[glass shatters]

18:13.218 --> 18:15.584
Tony Kaufman went to the
University of Colorado

18:15.804 --> 18:17.715
in Boulder,
but he never graduated.

18:17.931 --> 18:20.343
Both parents deceased,
uh, shortly after.

18:20.559 --> 18:21.969
He moved to Durant
five years ago

18:22.185 --> 18:23.846
to guide for
Powder River Rafting.

18:24.062 --> 18:25.768
Married Tizz Crandall
four years ago.

18:25.981 --> 18:27.892
Moved back to Colorado
two years ago.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.645
A couple of speeding tickets.
One DUI.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.475
You find his employer
down there?

18:32.696 --> 18:34.652
I've been reaching out
to all the rafting operations

18:34.864 --> 18:36.820
near Pagosa Springs,
but nothing yet.

18:37.576 --> 18:38.406
Okay.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.402
Ruby will get you some
traveling money from petty cash.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.079
ReaHy?

18:46.585 --> 18:48.997
You want me to...go there?

18:49.212 --> 18:50.588
It's not Hawaii, Ferg.

18:51.339 --> 18:52.624
It's Colorado.

18:53.341 --> 18:54.842
Just for a night or two.

18:55.969 --> 18:56.719
[drawer closes]

18:58.013 --> 18:59.253
Unless you don't want to go.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.133
No, no, no.
I'll go.

19:01.349 --> 19:02.634
Whatever you need, Sheriff.

19:03.059 --> 19:05.175
You should
probably bring this.

19:12.944 --> 19:15.651
Hey, since Ferg's gonna be in
Colorado, do you think you and I

19:15.864 --> 19:18.446
should go check out Tony's
last place of employment here?

19:18.658 --> 19:21.195
What is it --
Powder River Rafting?

19:21.411 --> 19:22.571
Uh, you go ahead.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.527
I'm gonna follow up
on the autopsy report

19:24.748 --> 19:27.034
and read some poetry.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.036
If the clue to the
treasure is here,

19:29.252 --> 19:31.368
maybe the clue to his
death is here, too.

19:31.588 --> 19:32.577
Okay.

19:40.096 --> 19:42.678
[indistinct conversations]

19:50.607 --> 19:51.972
Hey, are you Spence?

19:52.442 --> 19:53.306
Yeah.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.518
Your boss said I
should talk to you.

19:57.322 --> 19:59.313
Uh-oh.
What did I do?

19:59.532 --> 20:01.523
He said that you were friends
with Tony Kaufman.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.321
Oh.
Well, I was.

20:04.913 --> 20:06.403
When is the last time
you talked to him?

20:06.915 --> 20:07.995
In person?

20:08.208 --> 20:10.574
A couple of years ago,
right before he blew town.

20:10.794 --> 20:12.659
Since then,
total radio silence,

20:12.879 --> 20:15.495
one Facebook post on my birthday
about a month ago,

20:15.715 --> 20:16.579
but that's it.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.006
Any idea why he left?

20:18.218 --> 20:20.049
ljust figured
his wife sent him packing.

20:20.261 --> 20:21.671
And why would she do that?

20:21.888 --> 20:24.675
-'Cause she finally caught him.
-Doing what?

20:24.891 --> 20:26.677
[chuckles]
You mean doing who.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.304
Look, this job
is only about 50%

20:29.521 --> 20:31.261
keeping people from
drowning in the river.

20:31.481 --> 20:35.941
The other 50%‘s pretty much
about partying and, um, whatnot.

20:37.362 --> 20:38.192
Right.

20:38.405 --> 20:43.024
So, his, uh -- his wife
caught him, uh, partaking

20:43.243 --> 20:44.528
in a little bit
of whatnot?

20:44.744 --> 20:46.280
She knew he was an operator.

20:47.831 --> 20:49.037
Are you okay?

20:49.249 --> 20:50.284
Yeah.

20:51.251 --> 20:54.835
Um...how did she know
that he was an operator?

20:55.839 --> 20:57.375
How do you think those two met
in the first place?

20:57.590 --> 20:59.126
He targeted her
on a two-night trip

20:59.342 --> 21:00.752
on the Green River
down in Utah.

21:00.969 --> 21:02.755
You really don't look good.
You want to sit down?

21:03.805 --> 21:04.715
Yeah.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.009
You were saying?

21:07.308 --> 21:10.175
Uh, anyway, I always thought
Tizz deserved better.

21:10.395 --> 21:14.263
Tony was fun to hang with
but hardly marriage material.

21:14.482 --> 21:15.597
If this guy was such a partier,

21:15.817 --> 21:17.682
why did he get married in the
first place?

21:17.902 --> 21:20.860
Tizz is great.
She was really into him.

21:21.072 --> 21:22.152
And she was loaded.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.071
So if his wife
had kicked him out,

21:24.284 --> 21:26.115
he would have been strapped
for cash?

21:26.286 --> 21:27.992
[laughs] Yeah.

21:28.204 --> 21:29.660
Do you think that
he would have, uh,

21:29.873 --> 21:32.159
gone searching
for Anson Hamilton's treasure?

21:33.126 --> 21:35.583
Well, if he did,
he didn't tell me about it.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.036
Okay.

21:38.256 --> 21:40.668
Uh, okay.

21:40.884 --> 21:41.964
I'm gonna go.

21:42.719 --> 21:43.925
Thank you.
[clears throat]

21:44.429 --> 21:46.010
[grunts, vomits]

21:46.222 --> 21:47.177
[spits]

21:51.227 --> 21:52.091
Shit.
I'm sorry.

21:52.312 --> 21:53.267
Um...

21:55.690 --> 21:57.396
It was some bad on.

21:57.859 --> 21:59.395
Don't go
to that new bagel place.

22:00.653 --> 22:04.521
[rock music playing on radio]

22:04.699 --> 22:05.984
[indistinct conversations]

22:06.201 --> 22:07.987
[Ferg]
You're under arrest, Ms. Joyce.

22:08.203 --> 22:09.534
Geez, you scared the --

22:09.704 --> 22:11.035
Oh, you scared the heck
out of me.

22:11.247 --> 22:13.499
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but, uh, I'm afraid

22:13.708 --> 22:15.539
I'm gonna have to ask you
to come with me.

22:17.128 --> 22:17.992
To Colorado.

22:18.546 --> 22:19.797
What are you
talking about?

22:20.006 --> 22:22.543
Well, it turns out I made
a real impression on Walt

22:22.759 --> 22:24.420
lifting that fingerprint
off my badge,

22:24.636 --> 22:27.048
so he rewarded me by sending me
on a little business trip.

22:27.263 --> 22:30.630
I thought maybe we could mix in
a little pleasure.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.465
Lawbreake r.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.016
What part of Colorado?

22:34.229 --> 22:35.469
Pagosa Springs.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.395
Oh, it's the Paris
of the Southwest.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.189
[dog barking in distance]

22:47.158 --> 22:48.614
[knock, door opens]

22:49.494 --> 22:51.325
How's the poetry reading
going?

22:51.538 --> 22:54.200
Well, as poetry, it's, uh --
It's amateurish,

22:54.415 --> 22:56.952
but, um, as a puzzle,
it's interesting.

22:57.752 --> 22:59.743
I'm having a hard time making
sense of some of it, though,

22:59.963 --> 23:03.205
so I'm having Ruby track down
those two treasure hunters.

23:03.424 --> 23:06.712
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

23:08.388 --> 23:10.344
So, how about you?
What did you learn?

23:10.890 --> 23:13.267
Tony Kaufman is definitely
a gold digger.

23:13.476 --> 23:16.934
So you think he was
searching for the
Anson Hamilton treasure, too?

23:17.146 --> 23:18.602
[exhales deeply]

23:18.815 --> 23:20.271
Maybe.

23:20.483 --> 23:22.769
But he was definitely
the other kind of gold digger --

23:22.986 --> 23:25.477
conniving asshole
who married Tizz for her money.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.692
Hardly matches the picture
that Tizz painted of him.

23:31.661 --> 23:33.652
One of Tony's old friends
from the rafting company

23:33.872 --> 23:36.113
thought she might have kicked
him out for cheating on her.

23:38.042 --> 23:38.872
Huh.

23:40.336 --> 23:41.200
What?

23:41.838 --> 23:43.169
Doc Weston called.

23:43.548 --> 23:45.664
Said the cause of death
was several stab wounds

23:45.884 --> 23:47.465
to the gut and chest.

23:49.053 --> 23:50.589
-That's brutal.
-Yeah.

23:51.848 --> 23:54.635
Seems like we might be dealing
with a crime of passion.

23:54.809 --> 23:57.425
Seems like it,
but there's still the question

23:57.645 --> 24:00.227
of how she could have gotten him
into that tree.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.566
Doc Weston have any sense of how
long the body had been in there?

24:05.778 --> 24:08.190
Under the circumstances,
it's hard to be specific,

24:08.406 --> 24:11.193
but, um,
likely more than a year.

24:12.911 --> 24:15.493
Didn't Tizz just get a letter
from Tony four months ago?

24:15.705 --> 24:17.366
And his friend
from the rafting company

24:17.582 --> 24:18.947
got a birthday post
last month.

24:19.167 --> 24:20.122
How does that happen?

24:21.002 --> 24:21.787
I don't know.

24:22.003 --> 24:22.833
[knock on door]

24:23.922 --> 24:26.664
I couldn't reach either one
of those treasure hunters,

24:26.883 --> 24:30.341
but I did a little research, and
they are quite the odd couple.

24:31.304 --> 24:33.590
Tom Fuller -- unemployed --

24:33.806 --> 24:37.173
but he was adjunct professor
of modern poetry.

24:37.393 --> 24:41.636
And the other guy, Jim Mackey --
He's a bail bondsman.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.191
-This is Jim's rap sheet?
-Mm-hmm.

24:44.400 --> 24:48.359
Assaults in three states and
a felony conviction in Florida.

24:50.031 --> 24:52.647
"Bounty hunter suspected
in murder of fugitive."

24:53.242 --> 24:55.324
Yeah, Jim was never even charged
for that one.

24:55.536 --> 24:58.869
But it was all over the papers
in Colorado two years ago.

24:59.374 --> 25:00.580
-Colorado?
-Mm-hmm.

25:00.792 --> 25:02.123
Is he still
a bail bondsman?

25:02.335 --> 25:04.621
Lost his license three times,
three different states.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.419
How does a guy like that end up
partnered with a lit major

25:07.632 --> 25:08.838
in the middle of Wyoming?

25:09.050 --> 25:10.836
I'd like to know that, too.

25:11.719 --> 25:14.176
If they went back out
looking for another hollow tree,

25:14.389 --> 25:16.721
they probably contacted
the Forest Service again.

25:16.933 --> 25:18.423
We need to get over there,

25:18.643 --> 25:20.725
and see if they can help us
locate the odd couple.

25:21.562 --> 25:26.397
Walt...she's not going anywhere
but home.

25:26.609 --> 25:29.191
Vic, you don't
look well, sweetie.

25:29.404 --> 25:31.486
I'm fine.
I-It's just the new bagel place.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.939
I've never heard of a bagel
making someone sick.

25:34.158 --> 25:35.819
-No, it was the on.
-Oh.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.536
I should have known
you don't order on

25:37.745 --> 25:38.575
in the middle of Wyoming.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.028
-Yeah.
-Ruby's right.

25:40.248 --> 25:41.237
You head home.

25:41.457 --> 25:44.290
I'll talk to those,
uh, Forest Service firefighters.

25:44.502 --> 25:46.003
But after you call
your lawyer.

25:47.547 --> 25:49.583
Probably just wants me to sign
the settlement papers.

25:49.799 --> 25:51.915
That can wait.
I'll call him later.

25:52.927 --> 25:54.918
[door opens]
[sighs]

25:56.347 --> 25:57.462
Walter.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.347
[door opens, closes]

26:08.568 --> 26:10.809
[Cady]
Asha, where are you going?

26:11.029 --> 26:12.690
-Home.
-No, you can't.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.441
-Who are you?
-She's my cousin.

26:14.657 --> 26:16.522
-I called her to come get me.
-Asha, I'm so sorry.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.734
I cannot let you do this.

26:19.287 --> 26:21.824
I heard J.P.
on your answering machine.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.577
Your restraining order worked.
He -- He said he's sorry.

26:24.792 --> 26:26.373
Of course he did.
You believe him?

26:29.172 --> 26:32.414
Yeah. Of course.
He's my husband.

26:32.633 --> 26:34.464
He's also drunk,
and he's angry.

26:34.677 --> 26:36.759
No, that was before.
On his message, he sounded so --

26:36.971 --> 26:38.256
Asha, I was just there.

26:39.599 --> 26:42.511
See? I got you
some of your things.

26:43.853 --> 26:46.435
There were vodka bottles
that weren't there yesterday.

26:47.231 --> 26:48.641
And he broke something
when I left.

26:48.858 --> 26:51.224
Is that the kind of house you
want to go back to right now?

26:52.028 --> 26:54.610
-I can't stay here forever.
-No one said forever.

26:55.198 --> 26:56.688
But you and I both know
what'll happen

26:56.908 --> 26:58.523
if you go back there
right now.

27:01.913 --> 27:04.620
[down-tempo music plays]

27:15.176 --> 27:16.586
[man coughs]

27:21.557 --> 27:22.672
Hi there.

27:23.726 --> 27:25.227
Which one of you
is in charge here?

27:25.436 --> 27:28.269
I didn't do nothing.
[chuckles]

27:28.481 --> 27:29.891
Sheriff Longmire.

27:30.108 --> 27:31.814
Hello. Nice to meet you.
All right, gentlemen.

27:32.026 --> 27:33.266
Just get another run at it.

27:33.486 --> 27:35.192
-New recruits?
-Yes, sir.

27:35.404 --> 27:37.781
Just a couple weeks ago, they
were banging out in East LA.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.400
-That hard to find rangers?
-Nah.

27:39.617 --> 27:41.027
They're just a part of a program

27:41.244 --> 27:43.360
to get kids out of their
neighborhood gang area,

27:43.579 --> 27:45.160
get them out here
doing something useful,

27:45.373 --> 27:47.989
train them to be hotshots,
show them a different path.

27:48.292 --> 27:49.407
Does it work?

27:49.627 --> 27:50.707
It did for me.

27:51.295 --> 27:52.876
So, uh, what can I help you
with, Sheriff?

27:53.673 --> 27:56.085
Actually, I was wondering
if you guys have been contacted

27:56.300 --> 27:58.131
by any, uh,
treasure hunters.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.208
Hey,boss.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.965
Sheriff's asking
about some treasure hunters.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.172
You talking about
that damn Anson Hamilton poem?

28:04.809 --> 28:05.844
lam.

28:06.060 --> 28:08.847
Yeah, "To the Absarokas,
past hill and hollow."

28:09.564 --> 28:11.020
Probably had 30 or 40
people calling

28:13.359 --> 28:15.441
-Yep.
-Twice as many so far this year.

28:15.653 --> 28:17.268
I guess it's gone viral.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.645
Do you keep a record
of these callers?

28:19.866 --> 28:22.448
No. It's only just dawned on us
that it's a thing.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.196
I mean,
most people just call.

28:24.412 --> 28:26.744
Every now and then, we'll get
the more determined folks

28:26.956 --> 28:30.369
that show up in person,
asking about hollow trees.

28:30.585 --> 28:32.576
You got to be careful
with them hollow trees.

28:32.795 --> 28:35.081
People don't know what they're
doing, they can be dangerous.

28:35.298 --> 28:36.913
They're not all filled
with elves, you know?

28:37.133 --> 28:38.088
[chuckles]

28:39.719 --> 28:40.834
These guys come by?

28:42.013 --> 28:44.095
Yeah.
They were in a few days ago.

28:44.307 --> 28:45.843
They had a fair amount
of climbing experience,

28:46.058 --> 28:47.468
so I told them about
the same eight trees

28:47.685 --> 28:48.515
I tell everyone about.

28:49.228 --> 28:50.013
The one guy was cool,

28:50.229 --> 28:52.311
but this other guy, Jim,
kind of got up in my grille.

28:53.191 --> 28:54.897
He was sure I was holding out
on him.

28:55.276 --> 28:57.358
Have they called or been back
in the last 24 hours?

28:57.570 --> 28:58.355
No.

28:59.363 --> 29:02.696
What about him?
Has he come about the treasure?

29:02.909 --> 29:05.241
That'd be a year
or two back.

29:05.453 --> 29:07.284
Yeah.
I recognize that guy.

29:07.496 --> 29:09.157
His name's Tony Kaufman.

29:09.373 --> 29:10.783
Huh.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.490
That's Tizz's ex.

29:13.628 --> 29:15.038
What an asshole.

29:17.632 --> 29:18.792
So you do know him.

29:19.008 --> 29:20.168
Well, I know Tizz.

29:20.384 --> 29:21.294
They're the ones
who threw that party

29:21.510 --> 29:23.011
after the Black Knoll Fire.

29:23.221 --> 29:25.678
Oh, that's right. A while back.
They were cool peoples. Yeah.

29:25.890 --> 29:28.347
Yeah, Tizz's mom's house
was in the evacuation zone.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.390
It was pretty much
rich people's houses.

29:30.603 --> 29:33.436
And, uh, they were pretty happy
when we got that fire contained.

29:33.648 --> 29:35.434
So they threw
a thank-you party.

29:35.650 --> 29:37.140
Was Tony there?

29:37.360 --> 29:39.692
Mm. I don't know.
Maybe?

29:39.904 --> 29:41.144
Well, I'm confused.

29:41.364 --> 29:43.195
Uh, you don't seem
to know him very well,

29:43.407 --> 29:45.363
but you have a pretty strong
opinion about him.

29:47.620 --> 29:49.906
I heard how he cheated
on Tizz.

29:51.249 --> 29:52.785
W-Why you asking
about all this stuff?

29:53.000 --> 29:55.036
Something happen to Tony
or them treasure hunters?

29:55.253 --> 29:56.709
Well, you could say that.

29:56.921 --> 29:59.833
Um, they found Tony's body
in a hollow tree.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.336
-What?
-Huh.

30:02.551 --> 30:04.883
Kind of makes you believe
in karma.

30:22.697 --> 30:24.608
[scoffs]
Stupid.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.450
[knock on door]

30:36.711 --> 30:38.952
Hi, Tizz.
You mind if I come in?

30:39.797 --> 30:40.752
No.
Of course.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.005
Thank you.
[clears throat]

30:45.344 --> 30:48.928
Your mom's guest house
is bigger than my house.

30:49.140 --> 30:50.801
How long you lived here?

30:51.600 --> 30:53.886
Um, Tony and I moved in
when we got married.

30:54.103 --> 30:55.809
Have you figured out
what happened to him yet?

30:56.022 --> 30:58.058
Not yet.
I'm working on it.

30:59.108 --> 31:00.518
Is that Grand Teton?

31:01.068 --> 31:02.148
South Teton.

31:02.653 --> 31:04.769
We were gonna do the Grand
the next summer.

31:07.575 --> 31:09.486
So, what brings you here?

31:09.702 --> 31:11.283
You can't possibly have
more bad news.

31:11.495 --> 31:13.326
No, but, uh, I got to
ask you some questions

31:13.539 --> 31:15.700
that aren't gonna be
too much fun.

31:17.084 --> 31:17.948
Oh.

31:18.794 --> 31:21.581
Were you aware that your husband
might have been unfaithful?

31:22.882 --> 31:23.746
Yes.

31:24.508 --> 31:27.045
Sheriff, I knew
who I was marrying,

31:27.261 --> 31:29.502
but I loved him anyway,
no matter what.

31:30.306 --> 31:31.170
lstill do.

31:31.849 --> 31:34.056
Well, your mom doesn't seem to
share that affection for Tony.

31:34.268 --> 31:35.132
Yeah.

31:36.270 --> 31:40.479
Although I'm not sure
that was ever really about Tony.

31:41.359 --> 31:45.648
There's part of me that thinks
maybe she was jealous of me.

31:47.531 --> 31:48.941
I know it sounds awful,

31:49.909 --> 31:53.527
but after she lost my dad,
she just couldn't stand

31:53.746 --> 31:56.112
the thought of me having someone
when she didn't.

31:57.166 --> 32:00.203
So when I married Tony, she just
made things difficult for us.

32:00.961 --> 32:02.576
Can you be more specific?

32:02.838 --> 32:04.453
Well, she was
just really judgmental.

32:04.673 --> 32:05.537
Tony couldn't stand her.

32:05.758 --> 32:07.043
He wanted to move out,

32:07.259 --> 32:08.510
but he couldn't really afford
another place.

32:08.719 --> 32:11.552
One night things got so bad,

32:11.764 --> 32:13.629
he threatened to file
for divorce.

32:13.849 --> 32:15.385
Took me two days
to talk him out of it.

32:16.477 --> 32:18.058
So he left two years ago.

32:19.063 --> 32:21.270
Was there really a letter
four months ago?

32:21.482 --> 32:22.312
Yeah.

32:23.067 --> 32:24.978
I swear.
I got it.

32:25.778 --> 32:26.858
I still remember
the return address --

32:27.071 --> 32:29.858
P.O. Box 3165,
Pagosa Springs, Colorado.

32:30.783 --> 32:32.193
Did you write back?

32:34.078 --> 32:38.071
Don't tell my mom, but, um,
I actually drove down there.

32:39.333 --> 32:40.994
His number's unlisted,
but I got a family friend

32:41.210 --> 32:42.700
to track down
his street address.

32:43.838 --> 32:46.705
I waited outside his little
house, waiting to see him.

32:47.383 --> 32:48.668
I waited for hours.

32:50.344 --> 32:53.461
But...in the middle
of the night...

32:55.307 --> 32:57.013
I started to feel
like a stalker.

32:58.018 --> 33:01.931
I got so embarrassed,
I just -- I drove back.

33:02.148 --> 33:03.388
I drove all night.

33:04.108 --> 33:06.690
Can you give me that address
for his house?

33:06.902 --> 33:08.767
Yeah.
I have it memorized.

33:10.948 --> 33:13.781
You know, since you came by
earlier, I actually feel better.

33:14.285 --> 33:15.616
Less restless.

33:17.496 --> 33:21.739
When you love someone
as much as I loved Tony,

33:22.585 --> 33:24.121
even when they're gone,

33:25.671 --> 33:27.536
you can't help thinking they're
gonna walk through the door.

33:36.265 --> 33:37.846
At least now I know
he can't.

33:52.239 --> 33:53.695
Hey, Asha.

33:55.034 --> 33:56.240
I brought dinner.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.632
Thank you, Ms. Longmire.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.134
Well, don't thank me,

34:16.347 --> 34:18.383
because I don't know if I have
any silverware.

34:18.599 --> 34:20.885
[both laugh]

34:25.439 --> 34:27.976
[door creaks]

34:29.401 --> 34:31.266
Oh. Oh.

34:35.324 --> 34:37.110
J.P., you can't --
you can't be here.

34:37.326 --> 34:38.486
Hey, Ms. Longmire,

34:38.702 --> 34:40.158
I'm sorry for showing up
unannounced like this,

34:40.371 --> 34:41.486
but I have to talk
to Asha.

34:41.705 --> 34:43.320
How did you even know
she was here?

34:43.541 --> 34:44.826
Her cousin told me.

34:45.042 --> 34:47.875
Asha, baby, come here.

34:48.087 --> 34:49.668
I have to say something.
Baby, it's okay.

34:49.880 --> 34:52.417
I'm -- I'm not
gonna hurt you.

34:54.468 --> 34:55.878
J.P., I'm sorry,
but if you don't leave,

34:56.095 --> 34:57.631
I have to call
the tribal police.

34:57.846 --> 35:00.223
Asha, you're the love
of my life,

35:01.850 --> 35:03.260
and I never
should have hurt you.

35:04.311 --> 35:05.517
I'm sorry.

35:06.647 --> 35:09.434
But I want to give you
something to prove it.

35:13.153 --> 35:15.064
Oh, J.P.

35:20.286 --> 35:23.323
That's my chip
from Alcoholics Anonymous --

35:23.539 --> 35:24.779
my sobriety chip.

35:25.833 --> 35:28.074
I went to a meeting this
morning, and they gave me that,

35:29.003 --> 35:30.118
and I'm giving it to you.

35:31.171 --> 35:36.791
That's my promise to you right
now that I will stay sober.

35:40.055 --> 35:42.637
No, Asha, don't.
No. This is not right.

35:42.850 --> 35:44.056
You have to leave.

35:44.268 --> 35:45.758
J.P., I'm sorry.
I'm calling the police.

35:45.978 --> 35:47.934
No! Don't.

35:48.606 --> 35:50.142
I don't want
the police.

35:51.567 --> 35:53.933
I-I just want things
to be better.

35:56.655 --> 35:57.895
And now they will be.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.066
See?

36:02.286 --> 36:03.776
He's different.

36:13.130 --> 36:15.337
Asha, A.A. doesn't give you
your one-year chip

36:15.507 --> 36:17.463
the first day
you walk in there.

36:18.052 --> 36:18.962
They give it to you

36:19.178 --> 36:21.260
after you've been sober
for a whole year.

36:24.475 --> 36:27.467
I don't know where he got this,
but it's fake, okay?

36:27.686 --> 36:29.597
He didn't earn it,
and he's lying to you.

36:30.689 --> 36:31.599
And he's only using this

36:31.815 --> 36:33.146
to lure you
back into that house,

36:33.359 --> 36:34.849
and I won't
let that happen.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.569
Why don't you mind
your own damn business?

36:43.786 --> 36:44.821
You need to leave.

36:45.037 --> 36:46.527
Not without Asha.

36:46.747 --> 36:48.283
Okay.
Well, I'm dialing.

36:48.999 --> 36:51.411
And if you're still here when
they pick up, I'll report you,

36:51.627 --> 36:53.458
and they'll arrest you
and you'll go to jail.

36:54.338 --> 36:57.375
But if you leave now,
I'll hang up.

37:01.720 --> 37:02.880
Asha.

37:10.896 --> 37:11.760
Fine.

37:14.066 --> 37:14.896
I'll show you.

37:17.319 --> 37:18.650
I'm gonna stay sober.

37:21.532 --> 37:22.897
I'll show you both.

37:28.789 --> 37:30.245
[door closes]

37:30.457 --> 37:32.197
Shh. Shh.
Shh. Shh. Shh.

37:32.418 --> 37:34.625
[sobs]

37:34.837 --> 37:35.576
It's okay.

37:38.382 --> 37:39.918
It's over.

37:46.724 --> 37:48.760
I know we meant to connect
last night,

37:48.934 --> 37:50.765
so, uh, I just wanted to
apologize.

37:50.978 --> 37:52.969
N-No, actually,
I meant to call you,

37:53.188 --> 37:55.474
so I-I'm the one
who should be saying sorry.

37:55.649 --> 37:57.014
Well, I know it's not a
competition,

37:57.234 --> 38:00.021
but, uh, for the record,
uh, I'm up two now.

38:00.237 --> 38:04.651
No, you're up one cancellation,
but we are even in apologies.

38:04.867 --> 38:07.483
[chuckles]
But I was thinking maybe, uh --

38:07.703 --> 38:09.864
Maybe you would like to come
over to my house tonight.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.742
Oh, um...yeah.

38:12.958 --> 38:14.494
Yeah. Okay.

38:15.502 --> 38:17.493
Uh, right now I got to go.

38:17.713 --> 38:19.624
No, actually, I have to go.

38:20.048 --> 38:20.833
Tonight then.

38:21.049 --> 38:22.550
[laughing] Okay. All right.
All right. Bye.

38:25.095 --> 38:25.754
So...

38:27.765 --> 38:28.845
Tom.

38:30.434 --> 38:31.423
Where have you been?

38:32.102 --> 38:33.763
And why haven't you been
answering your phone?

38:33.979 --> 38:35.389
Jim wouldn't let me.
He's paranoid.

38:35.606 --> 38:37.437
He doesn't want us answering
any more questions

38:37.649 --> 38:38.638
about that poem.

38:39.610 --> 38:41.692
You know you're looking
in the wrong place.

38:42.946 --> 38:44.732
What?
H-How do you know that?

38:47.910 --> 38:49.195
It's right in the poem.

38:50.037 --> 38:51.197
Read that.

38:53.582 --> 38:57.074
"To the Absarokas,
past hill and hollow."

38:57.294 --> 38:59.410
That.
That's wrong.

38:59.630 --> 39:00.961
That doesn't scan.

39:01.173 --> 39:04.540
Every other line in the poem
has 10 syllables.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.045
That's got 11.

39:06.678 --> 39:07.588
I know.

39:07.805 --> 39:11.297
That's just because
Anson Hamilton is a hack poet.

39:11.517 --> 39:13.724
No.
No, that's not it.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.181
You're pronouncing
one of the words wrong.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.471
This county --
we call it Absaroka.

39:19.691 --> 39:22.307
Northwest of here
is a whole mountain range

39:22.528 --> 39:26.441
spelled the same, pronounced
differently -- "Absorka."

39:27.825 --> 39:28.689
Seriously?

39:29.034 --> 39:29.944
Yeah.

39:31.370 --> 39:32.359
Take a seat.

39:38.335 --> 39:39.370
So, why are you here, Tom?

39:40.254 --> 39:42.870
Uh...it's about Jim.

39:43.090 --> 39:46.423
Right. Jim.
How long you two been friends?

39:46.635 --> 39:47.499
We're not friends.

39:48.512 --> 39:50.673
Business partners,
more like it.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.265
I answered an ad
on Craigslist.

39:52.432 --> 39:53.888
He was looking for
a poetry expert.

39:54.059 --> 39:56.345
And you're an expert
in modern poets.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.678
Wallace Stevens, primarily.

40:00.107 --> 40:01.438
How do you know that?

40:02.818 --> 40:04.058
Are you investigating me?

40:04.278 --> 40:05.814
What was it
you needed to tell me?

40:07.197 --> 40:08.812
I'm not sure what it means,

40:09.032 --> 40:11.193
but I woke up in the middle
of the night two nights ago,

40:11.410 --> 40:12.741
and Jim wasn't in the tent.

40:12.953 --> 40:15.114
-Where was he?
-I don't know. Gone.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.286
And then I asked him about it
the next morning,

40:17.457 --> 40:19.618
and he acted
like I was crazy.

40:19.835 --> 40:21.791
He said I was dreaming,
but I wasn't.

40:22.713 --> 40:24.829
You two have been traveling
together for a long time.

40:25.048 --> 40:27.881
Did Jim ever, um,
carry anything odd with him?

40:28.093 --> 40:30.709
Anything...large?

40:33.348 --> 40:34.804
Oh, my God.

40:36.643 --> 40:38.725
You think he dumped that body
in the tree?

40:38.937 --> 40:41.098
You know if Jim had any
business partners before you?

40:41.315 --> 40:44.978
Is that who was in the tree?
Oh, man.

40:45.193 --> 40:47.229
Tom.
Take it easy.

40:47.988 --> 40:49.979
-Where's Jim right now?
-I don't know.

40:50.657 --> 40:54.070
Halfway to the Absorkas
for all I know.

40:58.165 --> 41:00.201
[rock music playing on radio]

41:00.417 --> 41:01.782
I like business trips.

41:02.002 --> 41:04.163
Well, the business part of it
is a bit of a bust.

41:04.379 --> 41:06.711
I talked to 10 different
white-water rafting companies,

41:06.924 --> 41:08.835
and I couldn't find
one single person

41:09.051 --> 41:11.007
who'd even heard
of Tony Kaufman.

41:11.219 --> 41:14.086
[music continues]

41:17.601 --> 41:18.636
But...

41:18.852 --> 41:19.887
[radio shuts off]

41:20.103 --> 41:21.479
...it's all been worth it...

41:22.689 --> 41:26.102
."because".
I found this.

41:26.318 --> 41:27.728
Shut up.

41:27.945 --> 41:28.980
[laughs]

41:31.782 --> 41:33.522
Okay.
I love this.

41:33.742 --> 41:35.198
[both laugh]

41:35.410 --> 41:36.445
You better.

41:36.662 --> 41:38.323
That thing cost
more than $12.

41:40.123 --> 41:41.329
Somebody lives here?

41:41.541 --> 41:44.157
According to Walt,
Tony Kaufman does.

41:44.378 --> 41:45.709
I thought you said
he just had a P.O. box

41:45.921 --> 41:47.001
and an unlisted number.

41:48.924 --> 41:51.711
True, but Walt
has his ways.

41:52.386 --> 41:53.546
That's so cool.

41:53.762 --> 41:57.425
So you guys have access to all
kinds of secret databases?

41:58.225 --> 41:59.260
-We're not spies.
-No, I know that.

41:59.476 --> 42:02.718
But, like, you can search other
sheriff's departments' records?

42:04.022 --> 42:05.432
Well, in theory.

42:05.649 --> 42:08.311
But, you know, everybody's
on different systems.

42:22.833 --> 42:24.539
This thing looks
pretty flimsy.

42:25.460 --> 42:27.075
You should probably
stand back, Meg.

42:27.295 --> 42:28.626
Such a badass.

42:35.887 --> 42:37.013
[sighs]

42:39.224 --> 42:43.467
I'm telling you, it feels like
nobody's lived here for...ever.

42:43.687 --> 42:45.268
So there's no furniture
at all?

42:45.480 --> 42:51.521
Um, well, there's a bed,
side table,

42:51.737 --> 42:52.726
um...

42:53.989 --> 42:56.480
No, no, no, no.
Don't touch that.
[man] Hey, hey, hey.

42:56.700 --> 42:58.565
I can't take your call,
so leave a message.

42:58.785 --> 43:01.037
[answering machine beeps]
Ferg, who's there with you?

43:01.246 --> 43:02.361
Um...

43:06.960 --> 43:10.373
O-Okay, Walt, uh,
I just want to make it clear

43:10.589 --> 43:12.580
I didn't spend a dime
of department money

43:12.799 --> 43:13.959
on bringing Meg with me.

43:14.176 --> 43:15.416
Nobody said you did.

43:15.635 --> 43:16.795
I probably should have told you.

43:18.221 --> 43:19.085
Probably.

43:19.306 --> 43:21.968
So, uh, there's a bed,
a side table,

43:22.184 --> 43:23.640
and answering machine.

43:23.852 --> 43:25.217
-Anything else?
-No.

43:25.437 --> 43:27.519
Well, except for
this tiny little Eiffel Tower

43:27.731 --> 43:29.312
I found on the floor
of the bathroom.

43:32.402 --> 43:33.107
[door closes]

43:35.697 --> 43:36.777
[Cady] Hi.

43:39.618 --> 43:41.609
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean to scare you.

43:41.828 --> 43:43.079
The door was open.

43:44.915 --> 43:46.246
No. No.

43:46.458 --> 43:51.703
I am...happy that it is you
and not someone else.

43:53.548 --> 43:54.503
How are you?

43:54.716 --> 43:55.831
I'm okay.

43:57.219 --> 44:00.256
Um, do you remember a while back
when my dad and Mathias

44:00.472 --> 44:01.882
were searching your apartment

44:02.099 --> 44:04.010
for that woman who was beaten
by her husband?

44:07.437 --> 44:08.847
How do you know
about that?

44:09.356 --> 44:12.564
Once upon a time, my dad and I
used to tell each other things.

44:13.443 --> 44:16.435
Anyway, um, was she here?

44:17.489 --> 44:18.774
Did -- Did you help her?

44:18.990 --> 44:21.117
-Did your father think
I was lying?
-No.

44:21.326 --> 44:23.738
I-I know she wasn't here
when they searched,

44:23.954 --> 44:26.912
but...was she ever?

44:31.503 --> 44:33.289
Why are you asking me
about this?

44:33.505 --> 44:35.370
The whole thing gave me
anidea,

44:35.590 --> 44:38.172
and I know it's a lot to ask,
but I am running out of options.

44:38.385 --> 44:40.671
Enough with the preamble.

44:41.555 --> 44:43.967
Would you mind keeping an abused
woman here for a few days?

44:46.226 --> 44:48.433
The closest women's shelter
is two hours away,

44:48.645 --> 44:50.010
and she wants to be safe,

44:50.230 --> 44:51.561
but she doesn't want to give up
her whole life.

44:53.191 --> 44:56.979
Henry, you know I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't important.

45:00.949 --> 45:02.155
All right.

45:02.367 --> 45:03.777
I'm just trying to make sense
of this.

45:03.994 --> 45:06.576
You're saying the house
is in Tony Kaufman's name,

45:06.788 --> 45:08.494
but it was purchased
by Tizz's mom.

45:08.707 --> 45:10.197
Nancy Crandall bought
a house

45:10.417 --> 45:12.658
for the son-in-Iaw
she apparently hated.

45:12.878 --> 45:14.584
Maybe that's how
she got rid of him.

45:14.796 --> 45:15.876
She paid him off.

45:16.047 --> 45:17.332
This does not look like
the house

45:17.549 --> 45:18.755
of somebody
who'd been paid off.

45:18.967 --> 45:21.003
Like I said,
it was practically empty.

45:21.219 --> 45:23.301
Was the bed a single
or a double?

45:23.513 --> 45:24.798
It was a king, actually.

45:26.516 --> 45:27.301
What?

45:28.268 --> 45:30.224
What about that little
Eiffel Tower you mentioned?

45:30.437 --> 45:31.267
Right.

45:34.024 --> 45:34.854
Here it is.

45:36.443 --> 45:39.105
It's a charm
from a bracelet.

45:41.907 --> 45:42.942
Holy shit.

45:43.158 --> 45:45.069
It's just like the one
Tizz's mom was wearing.

45:46.578 --> 45:48.409
You think she was having
an affair with her son-in-Iaw?

45:49.623 --> 45:52.114
Tizz did say that she thought
her mom was jealous of her.

45:52.334 --> 45:54.541
He was as bad
of a philandering gold digger

45:54.753 --> 45:55.913
as everybody says he was.

45:56.421 --> 45:57.957
So, what do you think
happened?

45:58.798 --> 46:02.131
He slept with Mrs. Crandall,
then he threatened to tell Tizz,

46:02.344 --> 46:04.926
so she killed him
to keep him quiet?

46:05.138 --> 46:07.003
Or Tizz caught him in the act
and lost it.

46:07.224 --> 46:10.091
She's been to that cabin.
She knows where it is.

46:10.310 --> 46:12.801
And she's a climber, so she
could have gotten up that tree.

46:13.021 --> 46:15.512
Still, to get a dead body
up there,

46:15.732 --> 46:17.597
either one of them
would have needed help.

46:21.196 --> 46:22.982
Let's get a list
of all the hotshots

46:23.198 --> 46:24.904
that helped
in the Black Knoll fire.

46:25.116 --> 46:26.697
Uh, see which one of them
went to the party

46:26.910 --> 46:28.446
that Tizz and her
mom threw for them.

46:29.246 --> 46:30.031
Yeah.

46:38.046 --> 46:40.162
[Walt]
Uh, Tizz and I talked before

46:40.382 --> 46:42.714
about Tony's
extramarital affairs,

46:42.926 --> 46:44.962
but, uh, we didn't get into
any names.

46:45.178 --> 46:46.964
I'd really rather not dredge
all that up.

46:47.180 --> 46:48.966
I think it may be important.

46:50.225 --> 46:53.513
I never told you about the
circumstances of Tony's death.

46:53.728 --> 46:55.229
It wasn't obvious
at first.

46:55.438 --> 46:57.850
We thought maybe
he'd died accidentally

46:58.066 --> 46:59.306
looking for that treasure.

46:59.484 --> 47:01.850
But after I'd studied
that poem, I realized

47:02.070 --> 47:03.230
that nobody from Absaroka

47:03.446 --> 47:05.528
would really think
the treasure was here.

47:05.740 --> 47:10.154
And then, of course,
there were the autopsy results,

47:10.370 --> 47:12.326
which told
a different story.

47:12.539 --> 47:14.075
Tony was stabbed.

47:15.709 --> 47:16.915
Oh, my God.

47:17.127 --> 47:18.412
In my experience,

47:18.628 --> 47:21.244
that's often the sign
of a crime of passion.

47:21.464 --> 47:24.877
You think one of his flings
murdered him?

47:25.093 --> 47:27.379
I'd like to know about
who Tony was sleeping with.

47:29.014 --> 47:30.595
More specifically,

47:30.807 --> 47:33.264
I'd like to know if it was you,
Mrs. Crandall.

47:33.476 --> 47:36.934
What?!
You can't be serious!

47:37.147 --> 47:38.432
No.
Mom hated Tony.

47:38.648 --> 47:40.934
Then why did she buy him
that house in Colorado?

47:43.153 --> 47:43.938
What?

47:44.946 --> 47:50.486
We found this down there...
in Tony's bathroom.

47:53.872 --> 47:58.081
So, Mrs. Crandall, were you
having an affair with him?

47:58.293 --> 47:59.908
An affair?!
[scoffs]

48:00.128 --> 48:01.743
Icouldn't stand him!

48:01.963 --> 48:03.828
You really did hate Tony,
didn't you?

48:05.258 --> 48:06.873
So then if you weren't
sleeping with him,

48:07.093 --> 48:09.254
I guess you were just
pretending to be him,

48:09.471 --> 48:10.881
sending letters to Tizz,

48:11.097 --> 48:13.588
posting on his old friend's
Facebook page,

48:13.808 --> 48:14.968
collecting his mail,

48:15.185 --> 48:17.517
his phone calls
from time to time,

48:17.729 --> 48:20.596
keeping a dead man alive
just to torture your daughter.

48:24.444 --> 48:26.105
Tizz, I...

48:29.908 --> 48:31.773
l was trying to protect her

48:31.993 --> 48:35.986
from that deadbeat,
opportunistic husband.

48:36.206 --> 48:39.039
We can't protect our children
from their mistakes.

48:39.250 --> 48:41.502
We have to let them face
the consequences.

48:42.087 --> 48:45.921
Mom...is this true?

48:46.132 --> 48:47.747
You have to understand --

48:47.926 --> 48:51.544
I don't.
I don't understand.

48:51.763 --> 48:53.378
You knew that he was dead?

48:53.598 --> 48:55.099
-She killed him.
-No!

48:55.308 --> 48:58.266
She stabbed him, and she stuffed
his body in a hollow tree.

48:58.478 --> 49:00.890
That's not true!
I did not!

49:01.731 --> 49:03.813
Then you just hired
somebody to do it.

49:10.115 --> 49:14.404
Tizz, you didn't know
what Tony was really like.

49:14.619 --> 49:16.075
Yes, I did.

49:16.287 --> 49:18.198
And I still loved him.

49:18.415 --> 49:21.873
But he didn't love you.
He was going to divorce you.

49:22.085 --> 49:23.325
Because of you!

49:23.545 --> 49:26.002
Because you were so
horrible to him!

49:26.214 --> 49:26.999
No.

49:27.215 --> 49:30.423
He was going to divorce you
for your money.

49:30.635 --> 49:31.875
He had a lawyer.

49:32.095 --> 49:34.552
He came here,
and he said right to my face

49:34.764 --> 49:36.880
that he was going after
your inheritance.

49:37.100 --> 49:39.933
I couldn't let him do that
to you, to -- to us.

49:40.145 --> 49:41.806
So who was it, Mrs. Crandall?

49:43.773 --> 49:45.013
Who did you hire?

49:46.234 --> 49:49.317
[thudding]

49:49.529 --> 49:51.611
I didn't tell you to rest.
Let's go. Come on!

49:51.823 --> 49:53.063
Knees up. Knees up.
Knees up.

50:03.835 --> 50:05.871
Hey, Sheriff. Are you here
about that, uh, treasure hunter?

50:06.087 --> 50:07.873
What was his name? Uh, Jim?
Whoo.

50:08.047 --> 50:10.663
He thought there was treasure
in that tree and he went in.

50:10.884 --> 50:12.545
Then his rope broke,
he got stuck in there,

50:12.760 --> 50:14.591
he had to use his cellphone
to call us to get him out.

50:15.597 --> 50:17.007
That's not why I'm here.

50:25.190 --> 50:26.430
She tell you?

50:26.816 --> 50:27.931
Yep.

50:30.945 --> 50:33.027
T-That isn't me
anymore, Sheriff.

50:33.239 --> 50:34.900
That's the last time
I ever hurt anyone.

50:36.117 --> 50:37.152
I know.

51:01.142 --> 51:03.224
Hey.
Good news.

51:03.436 --> 51:06.052
I got you a place to stay,
at least for a night or two

51:06.272 --> 51:09.685
until we figure something else
out a little more long-term.

51:09.901 --> 51:11.141
Is it on the res?

51:11.361 --> 51:14.273
No. It's not far, though.
You know the Red Pony?

51:14.948 --> 51:16.108
There's an apartment
upstairs.

51:16.324 --> 51:17.689
It's very private.

51:18.743 --> 51:20.483
If you grab your things,
I'll take you over.

51:24.040 --> 51:25.200
[knock on door]

51:26.000 --> 51:26.910
Hey.

51:27.502 --> 51:28.457
Come on in.

51:29.212 --> 51:30.918
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

51:31.130 --> 51:32.085
[clears throat]

51:32.840 --> 51:35.001
Uh, perfect timing.

51:35.218 --> 51:37.334
I was just pouring us
a glass of wine.

51:38.054 --> 51:39.089
Here you go.
Thank you.

51:45.270 --> 51:46.851
You don't drink wine,
do you?

51:47.063 --> 51:48.018
Sure I do.

51:48.231 --> 51:49.266
I should have bought
some beer.

51:49.482 --> 51:50.892
I'm so sorry. I just...

51:51.109 --> 51:52.064
This is perfect.

51:52.986 --> 51:54.317
[both laugh]

51:56.531 --> 51:58.271
Mm.
Let me take, um --

51:58.491 --> 51:59.776
Let me take your --
your hat,

51:59.993 --> 52:01.699
and, um, I'll put that ov--
over here.

52:01.911 --> 52:04.152
And if you want to take off
your coat, I'll hang it up --

52:04.372 --> 52:05.282
Oh! Uh...

52:05.498 --> 52:06.533
-Oh. No.
-l'm sorry. Um...

52:06.749 --> 52:08.205
No, no, no, no, no.
That's okay.

52:08.418 --> 52:10.659
I have towels.
It's right here.

52:10.878 --> 52:12.459
-Let me do it.
-Here. Just grab that.

52:12.672 --> 52:14.754
And I'll grab some of these.
It's fine. I've got it.

52:14.966 --> 52:17.173
I did a good job.
[laughs]

52:19.262 --> 52:20.468
What's so funny?

52:21.681 --> 52:24.343
No-- l -- Nothing.
I just thought that, you know,

52:24.559 --> 52:26.174
we would be so
much more comfortable here,

52:26.394 --> 52:29.636
and that's already
so much worse.

52:29.814 --> 52:31.896
[chuckles]
Maybe if somebody busted in

52:32.108 --> 52:33.644
and started shooting up
the place,

52:33.860 --> 52:35.191
that would break
the tension.

52:35.403 --> 52:36.734
[laughs]

52:36.946 --> 52:40.655
Getting shot at the first time
you -- you kiss a girl

52:40.867 --> 52:43.859
is a pretty good excuse
for, um, being uncomfortable

52:44.078 --> 52:45.113
the second time.

52:47.749 --> 52:48.989
But that's not really it.

52:50.501 --> 52:51.490
Is it?

52:52.587 --> 52:53.497
No.

52:54.964 --> 52:58.331
Um, you're gonna think
this is corny.

53:00.386 --> 53:01.375
Try me.

53:03.264 --> 53:06.097
My wife and I, we waited.

53:09.020 --> 53:10.009
How long?

53:11.814 --> 53:13.190
Well, till we were married.

53:15.985 --> 53:17.521
I don't think that's corny.

53:19.447 --> 53:22.029
Would you be all right if
we just watch a movie tonight?

53:22.909 --> 53:26.493
Well, what made you think
that I invited you over here

53:26.704 --> 53:28.080
for anything else?

53:28.247 --> 53:29.623
You were trying to
get me drunk.

53:29.832 --> 53:32.244
[laughs]

53:34.671 --> 53:37.037
[horn honking in distance]

53:41.094 --> 53:43.426
[vehicle approaching]

53:51.062 --> 53:52.097
You think you're safe
in there?!

53:52.313 --> 53:53.553
Shit.
[lock clicks]

53:54.482 --> 53:55.767
You think you're safe
in there?!

53:55.983 --> 53:57.314
Go in the kitchen
and close the door.

53:57.527 --> 53:59.142
-I thought we were --
-Please, Asha, just do it!

54:01.489 --> 54:02.729
You think you can hide
from me?!

54:08.788 --> 54:11.700
Hey! Open the goddamn door!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

54:11.916 --> 54:13.156
Don't you go running away
from me.

54:13.376 --> 54:15.332
Don't you run away from me!
Open the door!

54:17.046 --> 54:19.287
Call 911. Here.
[gasps]

54:26.764 --> 54:28.846
What was that?
The front door.

54:29.517 --> 54:30.757
What are you doing
with that gun?

54:31.644 --> 54:33.885
Where's the loading gate?
Where's the loading gate?

54:34.105 --> 54:35.220
[singsong voice]
Asha?

54:35.440 --> 54:37.021
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

54:38.359 --> 54:39.519
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

54:39.736 --> 54:41.226
Nobody's picking up.
What do we do?

54:41.446 --> 54:42.435
Dial again.

54:43.823 --> 54:47.657
J.P., if you leave now,
I won't call the police.

54:48.995 --> 54:50.610
-Anything?
-No.

54:56.919 --> 54:58.705
Call my dad.
Call the sheriff.

54:58.921 --> 55:01.003
-Call the sheriff's office.
-The phone's dead.

55:01.215 --> 55:02.295
Well, I'm happy to leave.

55:03.301 --> 55:05.838
You just send my wife out here,
and we'll leave together.

55:06.053 --> 55:07.839
You know I
can't do that, J.P.

55:08.181 --> 55:10.513
I, please, just need you to go!
[doorknob rattling]

55:11.267 --> 55:13.804
J.P.? Sweetie?

55:14.020 --> 55:16.386
[gun cocks]

55:16.606 --> 55:19.439
They're gonna take you to jail.
I never wanted that.

55:19.650 --> 55:21.641
Oh. Oh, they're gonna
take me to jail?

55:21.861 --> 55:24.227
[laughs]
That is a joke.

55:24.447 --> 55:25.607
"From this day forward" --

55:25.823 --> 55:27.233
Do you remember
saying that, Asha?

55:30.203 --> 55:32.239
-I don't know.
-You don't know?!

55:36.876 --> 55:38.707
"From this day forward...

55:39.879 --> 55:41.665
For better or for worse...
[pounding on door]

55:41.881 --> 55:44.088
In sickness and in health...

55:44.717 --> 55:46.708
To love and to cherish...

55:47.303 --> 55:48.804
Till death do us part"!

55:49.013 --> 55:50.253
[screams]

55:52.058 --> 55:54.014
That was your vow, Asha!

55:56.020 --> 55:57.385
Till death do us part!

55:59.315 --> 56:00.976
-Now I guess you got to die.
-No!

56:01.859 --> 56:02.974
No!

56:09.575 --> 56:10.690
[gasping]

56:21.546 --> 56:23.252
This is all
your fault, bitch!
