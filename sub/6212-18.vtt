WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:03.170
Sabrina, is it
my imagination

00:03.170 --> 00:04.338
or do you eat
more with us now

00:04.338 --> 00:05.539
than when you lived here?

00:05.539 --> 00:06.540
Oh well, I couldn't
stay away

00:06.540 --> 00:08.175
and nobody makes goulash
like Aunt Zelda.

00:08.175 --> 00:10.477
The trick is to
marinate the ghoul.

00:10.477 --> 00:12.613
( <i>dings</i> )
Oh, who would
be so rude

00:12.613 --> 00:14.781
as to send us mail
at dinnertime?

00:14.781 --> 00:17.784
It's from
cousin Marigold.

00:17.784 --> 00:19.253
( <i>gasps</i> )

00:19.253 --> 00:20.787
She wants to send
her daughter Amanda

00:20.787 --> 00:22.256
to live with us for a year.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.191
The same Amanda who set
our house on fire?

00:24.191 --> 00:25.292
And locked me in a jar?

00:25.292 --> 00:26.293
I'm so out of here.

00:26.293 --> 00:27.828
Wait, Sabrina.

00:27.828 --> 00:30.097
Oh, poor Amanda's
worse than ever.

00:30.097 --> 00:32.933
Can a person be worse
than pure evil?

00:32.933 --> 00:34.935
This is so sad.

00:34.935 --> 00:37.271
Her mother just
got married for
the 19th time

00:37.271 --> 00:39.273
and Amanda's not
taking it well.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.440
That makes two of us.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.843
I'm still trying to bag
husband number one.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.412
Marigold thinks if Amanda goes
to school in the mortal realm

00:45.412 --> 00:46.480
and lives here with us

00:46.480 --> 00:48.382
we might be able
to straighten her out.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.083
Zelda, this is
a huge commitment.

00:50.083 --> 00:51.685
We're going to have to think
long and hard

00:51.685 --> 00:53.020
before we agree to anything.

00:53.020 --> 00:54.888
No, she can't come.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.156
When's Amanda supposed
to be here?

00:56.156 --> 00:57.958
( <i>loud rumbling</i>
<i>and thunderclap</i> )

00:57.958 --> 00:59.693
Please let that be
an earthquake.

01:01.828 --> 01:02.963
Hi, everybody.

01:02.963 --> 01:05.766
Thank you so, so much
for taking me in.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.535
Ooh, what died in here?

01:08.535 --> 01:09.937
That would be our dinner.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.572
I'll order in.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.639
I guess since
you're at college

01:12.639 --> 01:13.907
I'll be taking
over your room.

01:13.907 --> 01:14.808
I think it's going
to be really cool

01:14.808 --> 01:16.410
once I change
everything about it.

01:18.278 --> 01:20.581
Well, that just killed
my appetite.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.316
I think it killed everybody's.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.550
( <i>noisy eating</i> )

01:23.550 --> 01:24.284
Well, not everybody's.

01:24.284 --> 01:26.286

02:06.960 --> 02:08.328
All right, well, that was fun.

02:08.328 --> 02:09.329
See you in a year.

02:09.329 --> 02:11.898
Honey, we're sorry
Amanda's taking over your room

02:11.898 --> 02:13.867
but we can't turn our backs
on family.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.902
Oh, I wouldn't turn
my back on Amanda ever.

02:15.902 --> 02:18.305
We'll make sure she doesn't
disturb any of your things.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.008
( <i>banging and crashing</i> )

02:24.344 --> 02:25.846
Thanks for taking
care of that.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.448
Salem's right.
The girl's pure evil.

02:28.448 --> 02:30.684
Ooh... can I borrow
this purse?

02:30.684 --> 02:32.019
Yeah, keep it all.

02:32.019 --> 02:34.321
I'll be sure to write.

02:36.456 --> 02:37.991
Zelda, what are we
going to do?

02:37.991 --> 02:39.226
We can't send
that little monster

02:39.226 --> 02:40.927
to a mortal high school.

02:40.927 --> 02:42.696
Well, maybe we could
home school her.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.931
Over my dead body.

02:45.365 --> 02:46.967
( <i>gasps</i> )

02:46.967 --> 02:49.670
Oh, look. A video.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.904
From Marigold.

02:50.904 --> 02:51.972
How thoughtful.

02:51.972 --> 02:55.409
It's probably 20 years overdue,
and she wants us to return it.

02:55.409 --> 02:56.977
Oh, look, there's a note.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.813
"I just met someone
on my honeymoon
who gave me this.

02:59.813 --> 03:02.482
Try it if you're desperate
and frustrated."

03:02.482 --> 03:05.852
That's when I usually
rent a video.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.756
MAN:
Typical suburban teenagers

03:09.756 --> 03:12.325
living in a typical
suburban home.

03:12.325 --> 03:13.326
<i>Not.</i>

03:13.326 --> 03:15.262
Welcome to Witchright Hall

03:15.262 --> 03:17.798
where rebellious and magically
challenged young witches

03:17.798 --> 03:19.866
learn to function
in the mortal realm.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.035
Hot diggety,
our troubles are over.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.604
Where children live and go
to school under the same roof

03:24.604 --> 03:26.773
learning to control
their magical impulses

03:26.773 --> 03:28.575
and use their powers
appropriately.

03:28.575 --> 03:30.177
I've seen enough.
I'll get the checkbook.

03:30.177 --> 03:31.945
-You throw Amanda
in the car.
-Wait one minute.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.447
To the neighborhood

03:33.447 --> 03:35.382
we're simply a
loving couple who...

03:35.382 --> 03:37.384
adopt delinquent youths.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.219
Oh, my God.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.588
That's James Hexton.

03:41.588 --> 03:43.090
<i>The</i> James Hexton?

03:43.090 --> 03:44.825
Who's James Hexton?

03:44.825 --> 03:46.026
The man whose heart
I shattered

03:46.026 --> 03:49.663
into a million pieces
back in 1469.

03:49.663 --> 03:52.332
Oh, he said
he'd never forgive me.

03:52.332 --> 03:53.767
Now I remember.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.903
He waded through a moat
of alligators just to see you

03:56.903 --> 03:59.306
and you slammed the door
in his face.

03:59.306 --> 04:00.741
I see his leg grew back.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.409
This is a disaster.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.911
If you take Amanda to the school
for an interview

04:04.911 --> 04:06.613
she'll never get in.

04:06.613 --> 04:08.014
He's right.

04:08.014 --> 04:09.783
Someone else
will have to take her.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.818
I can't get anybody into school.

04:11.818 --> 04:13.887
Daddy had to donate
a fleet of Volkswagens

04:13.887 --> 04:15.655
to get me into clown college.

04:16.323 --> 04:19.359
No, no, no, no, no.

04:19.359 --> 04:21.728
On second thought... <i>no.</i>

04:21.728 --> 04:23.263
I'll buy you a Porsche.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.097
Keep talking.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.365
Hilda... You

04:25.365 --> 04:29.202
can't bribe Sabrina
into doing the right
thing for her family.

04:29.202 --> 04:30.537
Stay out of this.

04:30.537 --> 04:31.371
Give me ten more seconds

04:31.371 --> 04:33.440
I'll have her palms so greased
she'll need a drip pan.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.641
Listen to me, Sabrina.

04:34.641 --> 04:37.177
Witchright Hall is
Amanda's last chance.

04:37.177 --> 04:38.779
If she doesn't get
accepted there

04:38.779 --> 04:40.714
she'll be banished
to the mortal realm forever

04:40.714 --> 04:43.784
causing destruction
wherever she goes.

04:43.784 --> 04:44.618
Unbelievable.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.820
I am this close
to getting a 911 Turbo

04:46.820 --> 04:48.755
and you play
the apocalypse card.

04:48.755 --> 04:49.923
I am good.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.860
SABRINA:
<i>Come on, Amanda, turn that</i>
<i>frown upside down. You're going</i>
<i>to love it here.</i>

04:53.860 --> 04:56.329
MAN:
What do you want? Why do I care?
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

04:56.329 --> 04:58.298
Uh, we have an
appointment with
the headmaster.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.766
Amanda Wickam and
her cousin Sabrina.

04:59.766 --> 05:00.534
We're a little early...

05:00.534 --> 05:01.568
Because everybody
hates me

05:01.568 --> 05:02.903
and they can't wait
to get rid of me.

05:02.903 --> 05:05.005
MAN:
Well, you sound like
a real peach.

05:05.005 --> 05:05.906
Door's open.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.278
Oh, look at this
sweet-looking dog.

05:11.278 --> 05:12.045
Here, boy.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.848
First off, I'm old enough
to be your grandfather.

05:14.848 --> 05:15.715
Secondly

05:15.715 --> 05:17.017
the name is Phil.

05:17.017 --> 05:17.818
Oh, a dog named Phil.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.053
Any relation to
a boy named Sue?

05:20.053 --> 05:21.054
Hands off, toots.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.456
I'm not one of your
touchy-feely types.

05:23.456 --> 05:26.259
I happen to be the head
of the phys ed department.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.128
Now, both of you drop
and give me 20.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.696
No way. I don't go
to school here.

05:29.696 --> 05:30.430
Yet.

05:30.430 --> 05:31.331
Okay, let's get

05:31.331 --> 05:32.766
a move on, you
lard bottoms.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.034
GIRL:
Coming, Coach Phil.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.036
Pathetic bunch.

05:36.036 --> 05:39.005
I know Yorkies who
run faster than you.

05:40.373 --> 05:41.208
Well, we know one thing:

05:41.208 --> 05:42.776
the phys ed
department is solid.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.478
Yeah, I wonder what kind
of slobbering animal
teaches history?

05:45.612 --> 05:46.847
That would be me.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.682
James Hexton, headmaster.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.482
In a few weeks

05:49.482 --> 05:51.952
I should have the slobbering
under control.

05:51.952 --> 05:52.953
She didn't mean that.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.255
This is Amanda and I'm
her cousin Sabrina.

05:55.255 --> 05:56.089
Delighted.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.858
Oh, um, would you excuse me
a minute?

05:57.858 --> 06:00.694
A mob of angry women
is about to show up at the door.

06:00.694 --> 06:04.497
This is a decent...!

06:04.497 --> 06:06.299
Make that mob of angry <i>men.</i>

06:06.299 --> 06:08.501
I'm so hit and miss today.

06:08.568 --> 06:09.236
MAN:
Hexton

06:09.236 --> 06:10.537
that hormone-crazed
son of yours

06:10.537 --> 06:11.771
is ruining our
daughters' lives.

06:11.771 --> 06:15.876
Oh, Lord, and it's
only just 4:00.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.510
All right, back in a jiff.

06:18.612 --> 06:21.114
Well, I for one am
loving this place.

06:21.114 --> 06:25.252
Great. Then you stay here
and I'll move in with your
roommates at college.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.920
Nicely done.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.589
Oh, I've often practiced
that technique myself

06:29.589 --> 06:31.591
but I keep coming up
against the same obstacle.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.126
Irritable spell syndrome?

06:33.126 --> 06:34.394
I'm mortal.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.796
The only magic I can do
involves mascara and...

06:36.796 --> 06:38.331
Lady Clairol.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.400
Robin Davis, school director.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.103
I'm guessing that feisty little
frozen thing is Amanda.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.171
Uh-huh. I'm her
room temperature
cousin, Sabrina.

06:45.171 --> 06:46.773
We have an appointment
with Professor Hexton.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.308
Oh, you are in for a treat.

06:48.308 --> 06:49.943
The man is a true innovator.

06:49.943 --> 06:52.078
This morning he took
his world history class

06:52.078 --> 06:53.813
back in time to meet Gandhi.

06:53.813 --> 06:54.547
Really?

06:54.547 --> 06:56.716
Yeah, they learned about
passive resistance

06:56.716 --> 06:59.719
and then treated the Mahatma
to an everything bagel.

06:59.719 --> 07:01.054
Oh, well right now
he's on the porch

07:01.054 --> 07:03.523
practicing passive resistance
on some irate neighbors.

07:03.523 --> 07:05.158
Bet that's going well.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.226
Be right back.

07:07.627 --> 07:09.362
This is a decent
place live.

07:09.362 --> 07:10.864
Afternoon, gentlemen.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.632
What seems to be
the problem today?

07:12.632 --> 07:14.534
Our daughters are so busy
mooning over your boy, Sean

07:14.534 --> 07:17.203
they can't eat, sleep
or do their homework.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.439
You gotta love me.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.041
Well, I don't think
they gotta.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.043
It just plain weird. It's like
he's got all the girls

07:23.043 --> 07:24.477
in the neighborhood
hypnotized.

07:24.477 --> 07:26.546
Hypnotized?

07:26.546 --> 07:27.948
Let me assure you
My husband and I

07:27.948 --> 07:29.316
will do everything
in our power

07:29.316 --> 07:32.686
to squelch whatever
magic Sean wields
over your daughters.

07:32.686 --> 07:33.687
You know, this town thinks

07:33.687 --> 07:35.488
you and your husband
are doing a fine thing

07:35.488 --> 07:37.123
taking in these screwed-up kids

07:37.123 --> 07:39.960
but if you can't control them,
be advised:

07:39.960 --> 07:42.896
we've got
a really <i>testy</i> Kiwanis Club.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.365
Oh, well, let that be
a warning to us.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.868
You put some kind
of romantic spell

07:48.868 --> 07:50.337
on those girls, didn't you?

07:50.337 --> 07:51.705
It seemed to work nicely

07:51.705 --> 07:54.474
with the dork spell
I put on their boyfriends.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.610
Sean, you can't play around
with people's feelings.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.212
Oh, unlike you two,
who can play around

07:59.212 --> 08:01.514
with the most sacred institution
in the mortal realm?

08:01.514 --> 08:03.650
Indian bingo?

08:03.650 --> 08:05.018
You pretend you're married.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.519
For your protection--

08:06.519 --> 08:08.588
to keep away
suspicious neighbors.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.824
Working like a charm so far.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.792
Don't you mouth off to us.

08:12.792 --> 08:13.927
I'm sending you
up to your room

08:13.927 --> 08:15.295
and taking away your magic.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.563
Now, give me the finger.

08:16.563 --> 08:18.098
With pleasure.

08:18.098 --> 08:21.267
You know what I mean.

08:24.938 --> 08:25.939
Very impressive.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.340
Oh, it's been a busy week.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.175
Got fingers coming out of my...

08:29.175 --> 08:31.277
Don't ask.

08:31.277 --> 08:32.112
Okay, Sabrina.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.546
What do you say
we defrost your cousin

08:33.546 --> 08:36.016
and get this
interview rolling?

08:37.283 --> 08:40.086
Oh, my God, I did it.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.222
No, it was me.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.923
It's always you.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.225
Nice meeting you.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.960
Catch up with
you later.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.995
If you'd care
to come this way.

08:53.199 --> 08:56.002
Oh, well, when in Rome...

08:56.002 --> 08:59.205
Well, first off, let's make
ourselves comfortable.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.440
Oh, well...

09:00.440 --> 09:02.475
we're already
comfortable.

09:02.475 --> 09:03.777
We felt at home
the minute we walked

09:03.777 --> 09:05.078
in the door,
right, Amanda?

09:05.078 --> 09:07.280
This place bites.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.314
It can.

09:08.314 --> 09:11.651
I wouldn't pet
the phys ed teacher.

09:11.651 --> 09:14.120
All right,
let's review your file.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.022
Wickam file, Wickam file.

09:16.022 --> 09:17.357
I know I put it somewhere.

09:17.357 --> 09:18.358
Excuse me.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.560
Ah, yes.

09:21.594 --> 09:22.228
Uh, Wickam

09:22.228 --> 09:23.630
I believe...

09:23.630 --> 09:25.799
Yes, here we are.

09:25.799 --> 09:26.699
Let's see.

09:26.699 --> 09:29.836
You've been expelled
from 12 different schools.

09:29.836 --> 09:32.872
You forced 14 teachers
into early retirement...

09:32.872 --> 09:35.875
one into a straitjacket.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.277
On the other hand,
you were the top seller

09:37.277 --> 09:39.479
in the Other Realm High
magazine drive.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.981
That's what I love about
Amanda-- she's a real go-getter.

09:41.981 --> 09:43.450
It says here you never
turned in the money.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.151
That's because I spent it
on a mountain bike.

09:45.151 --> 09:46.953
No, wait. I stole the bike.

09:46.953 --> 09:50.590
I spent the money
on a Kate Spade bag.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.693
So Amanda has a problem
with dishonesty and greed

09:53.693 --> 09:56.229
but that's just because
of her troubled background.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.997
I think
if you get to know Amanda

09:57.997 --> 10:01.534
you will see that she is
a good spirit with a kind heart.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.002
Oh! Ow!

10:03.002 --> 10:05.238
See how quickly
she warmed up to you?

10:13.646 --> 10:15.081
I'm so sorry--
I'm sure if
I just make

10:15.081 --> 10:17.617
a few phone calls,
I can get all of
Amanda's records.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.518
Not necessary.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.420
I know the type of student
I'm dealing with.

10:20.420 --> 10:21.754
Oh, please, Professor

10:21.754 --> 10:23.957
there's a lot more to Amanda
than meets the eye.

10:23.957 --> 10:27.293
I-I mean,
she's very serious about school.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.163
I'll have a banana split

10:30.163 --> 10:32.365
two scoops of vanilla,
with chocolate sprinkles.

10:32.365 --> 10:36.236
Oh, and, uh... get a little
something for yourself.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.204
I don't think so.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.441
Well, so much
for the interview.

10:41.441 --> 10:44.444
Now, when can you
come back for the tour?

10:44.444 --> 10:45.345
Hmm.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.513
Never?

10:46.513 --> 10:48.348
Or now, or sooner, you know.

10:48.348 --> 10:49.282
Whatever works for you.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.917
How about after
my faculty meeting?

10:50.917 --> 10:52.685
Oh, Amanda's flexible.

10:52.685 --> 10:54.487
What a kid!

10:55.622 --> 10:56.456
All right, let's begin

10:56.456 --> 10:58.358
today's meeting
with old business.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.626
Any old business?

10:59.626 --> 11:01.995
Yes, we need equipment
for the gym.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.363
We don't have a gym.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.565
We need a gym.

11:05.565 --> 11:07.200
I'll look into it.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.568
Any new business?

11:08.568 --> 11:10.537
I think we should
talk about Sean.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.639
He's been wreaking havoc
around here for months

11:12.639 --> 11:15.141
and, frankly, I don't know
if we can turn him around.

11:15.141 --> 11:16.142
Let me handle it.

11:16.142 --> 11:17.243
There's a pack
of Rottweilers

11:17.243 --> 11:18.444
downtown who owe me.

11:18.444 --> 11:19.779
You want to
have a student

11:19.779 --> 11:22.215
attacked by a
pack of wild dogs?

11:22.215 --> 11:24.484
You make it sound so dirty.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.519
Maybe that's because
my approach to education

11:26.519 --> 11:29.822
doesn't usually involve
drawing blood.

11:29.822 --> 11:31.691
James, he's been bringing
the entire neighborhood

11:31.691 --> 11:32.992
to our door
and jeopardizing

11:32.992 --> 11:34.561
the security
of the school.

11:34.561 --> 11:36.829
We may have to
consider expulsion.

11:36.829 --> 11:38.331
I cannot believe
what I am hearing.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.299
Are you telling me you want

11:39.299 --> 11:40.800
to just give up
on a troubled youth

11:40.800 --> 11:42.202
and turn him out on the street?

11:42.202 --> 11:44.070
I'm with the broad.

11:44.070 --> 11:45.205
Dump the chump.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.106
Tough love, baby.

11:47.974 --> 11:49.108
Yeah, well, forgive me

11:49.108 --> 11:50.276
if I don't take
the advice of someone

11:50.276 --> 11:53.479
who scratches himself
at the dining room table.

11:53.479 --> 11:55.582
I'm not giving up on Sean.

11:55.582 --> 11:56.983
If the witches had
given up on me

11:56.983 --> 11:59.552
when I was at correctional
school, where would I be today?

11:59.552 --> 12:00.954
Congress?

12:01.254 --> 12:02.822
Do we have
any beer nuts?

12:02.822 --> 12:03.389
All right, that's it.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.625
Meeting adjourned.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.794
Robin, why don't you
show Sabrina and Amanda

12:07.794 --> 12:08.628
around the school.

12:08.628 --> 12:11.231
Then later, I'll have Amanda
sit in on my Ethics class.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.132
How can I be of service?

12:13.132 --> 12:15.501
You can clean up the mess
you left in the backyard.

12:15.501 --> 12:16.502
Deal.

12:16.502 --> 12:18.938
But I want a new dental plan.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.208
Hi.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.209
You must be Amanda.

12:23.209 --> 12:25.211
Are you
a new student here?

12:25.211 --> 12:26.579
I hope not.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.880
You're negative.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.048
I used to be negative.

12:29.048 --> 12:30.750
Now, I just want
to make a good impression

12:30.750 --> 12:31.784
and have people like me

12:31.784 --> 12:34.621
for the positive, uplifting
person that I am.

12:34.621 --> 12:35.622
Good luck with that.

12:35.622 --> 12:36.623
Thanks.

12:36.623 --> 12:37.757
( <i>clock chimes</i> )

12:37.757 --> 12:38.591
Time for class.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.092
Are you sitting in?

12:39.092 --> 12:40.159
Wouldn't miss it.

12:40.159 --> 12:41.694
Great, you can sit
right next to me.

12:41.694 --> 12:44.430
The seat is
always empty.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.232
What a shock.

12:46.232 --> 12:47.300
Hey, everybody.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.903
Let's give a warm welcome
to our guest, Amanda.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.773
I love that outfit.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.241
It's yours.

12:57.543 --> 12:59.212
That's the best
you guys can do?

12:59.212 --> 13:01.180
And you call yourselves
delinquents?

13:01.180 --> 13:02.181
Ah, I do all right.

13:02.181 --> 13:03.249
The other day, I zapped

13:03.249 --> 13:06.386
a third cheek
onto Professor Hexton's butt.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.054
You're still doing butt jokes?

13:08.054 --> 13:10.323
That's so second grade.

13:11.557 --> 13:13.526
So, what do you do for fun?

13:13.526 --> 13:14.294
You're looking at the witch

13:14.294 --> 13:15.628
who put the hole
in the ozone layer.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.898
Wow, I didn't know
girls could do
stuff like that.

13:18.898 --> 13:20.333
Well, you don't know this girl.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.769
Okay, so here's the plan
for today's class.

13:22.769 --> 13:23.970
You--

13:23.970 --> 13:25.505
the minute Hexton
starts to talk

13:25.505 --> 13:26.706
release the killer bees.

13:26.706 --> 13:27.874
( <i>bees buzzing</i> )

13:27.874 --> 13:28.241
You--

13:28.241 --> 13:29.242
when the mood strikes

13:29.242 --> 13:31.044
unleash tornado in a drum.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.912
And stay low.

13:32.912 --> 13:33.813
( <i>wind howls</i> )

13:33.813 --> 13:34.614
And you, Smiley

13:34.614 --> 13:36.082
take your pick: salmonella

13:36.082 --> 13:38.518
or mad cow disease.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.286
I like them both.

13:40.286 --> 13:41.654
Aren't we going to get
in trouble?

13:41.654 --> 13:42.855
Hello, we're witches.

13:42.855 --> 13:44.991
You people have
so much to learn.

13:44.991 --> 13:45.992
( <i>hissing</i> )

13:45.992 --> 13:47.527
And I'll be the one
teaching them

13:47.527 --> 13:48.528
thank you very much.

13:48.528 --> 13:52.865
Now, please take your seats
and I'll take those jars.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.615
Well, Miss Wickam...

13:55.615 --> 13:56.135
( <i>clears throat</i> )

13:56.135 --> 13:59.138
You certainly are quite
bold for a guest.

13:59.138 --> 14:01.374
I'm just getting warmed up.

14:01.374 --> 14:02.508
Listen to me, dearie.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.977
I've been a witch
since the Spanish Inquisition

14:04.977 --> 14:08.748
and if Torquemada didn't
scare me, you certainly don't.

14:10.116 --> 14:12.418
All right, now, where did we
leave off yesterday?

14:12.418 --> 14:14.220
I was telling Sean
how I used my magic

14:14.220 --> 14:16.089
to hack into the computers
at the Pentagon

14:16.089 --> 14:18.091
and you were babbling on
about something.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.025
Ethics.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.393
Doesn't ring a bell.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.494
Ah, yes, now I remember.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.363
I was about to pose a problem.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.332
Suppose...
suppose you meet a mortal

14:26.332 --> 14:28.768
with whom you're interested
in having a relationship.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.503
How would you go about that?

14:30.503 --> 14:31.504
Sam.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.139
Well, I'd use
a mind-reading spell

14:33.139 --> 14:34.540
to amass data from her brain

14:34.540 --> 14:36.943
and then photographically
memorize her interests.

14:36.943 --> 14:37.944
News flash, dude.

14:37.944 --> 14:40.146
You're photographing
the wrong stuff.

14:41.114 --> 14:44.183
Yes, just the person
you want to listen to.

14:44.183 --> 14:45.485
The only way he can
get a girl to like him

14:45.485 --> 14:47.253
is to put a spell on her.

14:47.253 --> 14:47.820
Now, can anyone tell me

14:47.820 --> 14:49.122
what's wrong
with what Sean did?

14:49.122 --> 14:50.256
He got caught.

14:50.857 --> 14:53.826
Hmm... oh, yes, he did

14:53.826 --> 14:58.398
and now his magic finger
lives in this jar...

14:58.398 --> 15:00.500
with a toe.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.268
Can't explain.

15:02.268 --> 15:03.903
All right, now,
listen up, people.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.805
Here's the deal.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.373
You can't find
a relationship

15:07.373 --> 15:08.841
in a potion bottle.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.576
Oh, sure, you can
manipulate people

15:10.576 --> 15:12.812
but real friendship,
true love--

15:12.812 --> 15:15.381
they need more than magic
to survive.

15:15.381 --> 15:17.283
They need human emotion.

15:17.283 --> 15:18.818
What makes you such an expert?

15:18.818 --> 15:20.953
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call myself an expert

15:20.953 --> 15:22.755
but I do have some good friends

15:22.755 --> 15:26.692
and I did know
true love... once.

15:26.692 --> 15:28.027
Hmm.

15:28.027 --> 15:31.297
It was the summer of '69...

15:31.297 --> 15:33.433
1469, and Botticelli was having

15:33.433 --> 15:35.601
one of his backyard barbecues.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.937
Suddenly, I looked up
and saw a vision

15:37.937 --> 15:40.440
due west of a suckling pig.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.408
She was beautiful.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.877
Hmm... she was brilliant

15:44.877 --> 15:48.714
and for a brief moment in time,
she was mine.

15:48.714 --> 15:50.850
What happened?

15:50.850 --> 15:54.220
Ah, she left me for that
studmuffin, Gutenberg.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.388
Ah, big deal.

15:55.388 --> 15:56.923
So the guy printed a bible.

15:56.923 --> 15:58.724
It's not like he wrote
the blasted thing.

15:58.724 --> 15:59.892
Sorry.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.227
Well, maybe if you'd used magic

16:01.227 --> 16:02.595
you would have stayed together.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.198
Ah, but it wouldn't have been
the same, would it?

16:05.198 --> 16:07.667
Because I'd already
experienced real magic--

16:07.667 --> 16:10.470
that all-consuming passion
that comes from within.

16:10.470 --> 16:14.040
That's the most
romantic story
I've ever heard

16:14.040 --> 16:18.044
but if anybody ever dumps me
for a bible maker

16:18.044 --> 16:19.545
they're toast.

16:19.545 --> 16:20.847
( <i>energy ricocheting</i> )

16:22.715 --> 16:23.883
So, are you saying a guy like me

16:23.883 --> 16:26.652
can get a girl
without using any magic?

16:26.652 --> 16:28.020
I did.

16:28.020 --> 16:29.922
But she, like,
totally broke your heart.

16:29.922 --> 16:30.656
Hmm.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.125
Letting me know I had one.

16:33.125 --> 16:36.662
Now, why don't you see
if you can find yours.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.034
All right, people,
I'm going to let you

16:42.034 --> 16:43.669
ponder these matters
for a while

16:43.669 --> 16:46.806
while I take these jars
to the landfill.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.074
Carry on.

16:49.075 --> 16:51.110
Okay, Amanda, what else
you got in that magic bag?

16:51.110 --> 16:53.446
Everything from cold sores
to cold wars.

16:53.446 --> 16:54.213
Cool.

16:54.213 --> 16:55.348
Let me be the first to say

16:55.348 --> 16:56.883
you'd be a real asset
to this school.

16:56.883 --> 16:59.385
And... you can help me
with the yearbook.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.689
We still have a number
of applications to review

17:03.689 --> 17:05.224
before we fill the space,
but we'll call you

17:05.224 --> 17:06.492
as soon as we make
our decision.

17:06.492 --> 17:08.294
Okay, well, we'll be
waiting by the phone

17:08.294 --> 17:10.429
or the toaster, you know,
whichever's quicker.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.767
All right, let me
have it-- you hate
this place, right?

17:14.767 --> 17:15.701
I don't know,
it beats living

17:15.701 --> 17:17.403
with stepfather
number 19.

17:17.403 --> 17:19.772
Amanda, that is the
most positive thing
you've ever said.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.440
You must really
like it here.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.676
Well, it's the first place
I ever felt I belonged.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.578
If you get accepted here,
you don't have to be

17:25.578 --> 17:27.446
shuttled back and forth
from realm to realm.

17:27.446 --> 17:29.549
I mean, you could really
find some stability here

17:29.549 --> 17:30.750
and turn your life around.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.785
Yeah, it all sounds good

17:32.785 --> 17:33.786
but I learned
a long time ago

17:33.786 --> 17:35.087
not to get my hopes up.

17:35.087 --> 17:37.189
I'll put in a good word for you

17:37.189 --> 17:38.824
but it may not carry
much weight--

17:38.824 --> 17:39.825
I'm an umbrella.

17:39.825 --> 17:41.394
( <i>laughs</i> )

17:43.896 --> 17:44.931
What's taking so long?

17:44.931 --> 17:46.532
Why haven't they called yet?

17:46.532 --> 17:48.568
When they do,
can I answer the phone?

17:48.568 --> 17:51.704
I want to hear
James's voice one more time.

17:51.704 --> 17:52.605
Amanda really liked the place.

17:52.605 --> 17:53.673
I sure hope she gets in.

17:53.673 --> 17:54.607
That makes four of us.

17:54.607 --> 17:55.541
Five of us.

17:55.541 --> 17:57.043
( <i>phone rings</i> )

17:57.043 --> 17:58.277
Hello.

17:58.277 --> 17:59.745
Hi, hi, Professor Hexton.

17:59.745 --> 18:00.846
So?

18:00.846 --> 18:01.847
No?

18:01.847 --> 18:03.883
-Oh!
-Oh, say it
ain't so!

18:03.883 --> 18:05.952
But she was so...

18:05.952 --> 18:09.088
I see... but Amanda
really liked...

18:09.088 --> 18:13.025
Okay... thanks, anyway.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.427
I don't believe this.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.895
You? We're the
ones who are going

18:15.895 --> 18:17.630
to be stuck
living with her.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.265
Did they give you
any explanation

18:19.265 --> 18:20.933
as to why they didn't
accept Amanda?

18:20.933 --> 18:24.270
No, but they're going to.

18:24.270 --> 18:25.771
Is it okay
if I go to Compumart

18:25.771 --> 18:26.973
to look at hard drives?

18:26.973 --> 18:29.275
Well, after you
clear your place.

18:30.142 --> 18:33.346
The right way, please.

18:33.346 --> 18:36.048
( <i>silverware clinks</i> )

18:36.048 --> 18:38.217
I caught the end of
your lecture today.

18:38.217 --> 18:39.452
It was very moving.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.087
Oh, thanks.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.623
Do you think it had
any effect on the kids?

18:43.623 --> 18:47.360
Well, I know it made
me look at things
a bit differently.

18:47.360 --> 18:51.097
Do you think that you could ever
love that way again?

18:51.097 --> 18:55.735
Well, I suppose
it's... possible.

19:00.406 --> 19:02.475
I can't believe you rejected
my cousin, Amanda.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.277
If she's not right
for this nuthouse, who is?

19:05.277 --> 19:06.479
Hillary Kursburg.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.413
Thanks to her

19:07.413 --> 19:09.949
the Cubs haven't won
a World Series since 1908.

19:09.949 --> 19:10.483
We take only

19:10.483 --> 19:12.018
the most extreme cases.

19:12.018 --> 19:12.785
At the end of the day

19:12.785 --> 19:15.721
we felt that Amanda
just wasn't as troubled a soul.

19:15.721 --> 19:16.722
She's a nightmare!

19:16.722 --> 19:18.691
She's a spoiled,
selfish little brat

19:18.691 --> 19:19.825
who's been nothing
but trouble

19:19.825 --> 19:21.160
since the day
she was born.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.029
We thought
she was rather nice.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.231
Actually, that's
the main reason
we rejected her.

19:25.231 --> 19:26.799
Well, you saw
the well-behaved Amanda.

19:26.799 --> 19:27.933
Want to see the real Amanda?

19:27.933 --> 19:29.635
Watch what happens
when she finds out she
didn't get accepted.

19:29.635 --> 19:31.937
She's going to
go ballistic.

19:31.937 --> 19:32.371
Anything?

19:32.371 --> 19:33.372
Did the school call?

19:33.372 --> 19:34.907
Yes, sweetheart.

19:34.907 --> 19:35.908
Well, did I get in?

19:35.908 --> 19:38.110
SALEM:
In your dreams, sweetheart.

19:38.110 --> 19:39.378
Nasty cat.

19:39.378 --> 19:40.680
Oh, you think he's bad.
Keep watching

19:40.680 --> 19:43.115
Ten to one says
she blows up the house.

19:43.716 --> 19:44.784
( <i>Amanda whimpers</i> )

19:44.784 --> 19:46.619
She's crying!

19:46.619 --> 19:48.187
Tears of rage, I assure you.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.789
I really liked it there.

19:49.789 --> 19:52.658
I mean, it's the first place
that ever felt like home.

19:52.658 --> 19:53.993
Amazing!

19:53.993 --> 19:55.828
Amanda's the first
student ever to cry

19:55.828 --> 19:57.563
because she didn't
get accepted.

19:57.563 --> 19:59.465
Normally, they cry
because they do.

19:59.465 --> 20:01.200
She can change,
I promise!

20:01.200 --> 20:02.868
No, that won't
be necessary.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.771
Any witch who's that
desperate to be here

20:05.771 --> 20:07.306
deserves a place.

20:07.306 --> 20:08.874
You mean, you'll accept her?

20:08.874 --> 20:10.042
What about
the Kursburg girl?

20:10.042 --> 20:13.145
Oh, she's small.
We can squeeze her in.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.181
How soon can you
have Amanda here?

20:15.181 --> 20:17.283
Oh, sooner than
you can imagine.

20:18.150 --> 20:19.251
Just so we're clear

20:19.251 --> 20:22.121
I'm not sharing a room
with anybody.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.526
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

20:27.526 --> 20:29.261
I'll get it.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.232
Well, hello.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.533
Hi, my name's Tiffany.

20:34.533 --> 20:36.335
I'm selling raffle tickets
for my church.

20:36.335 --> 20:39.038
They're only a dollar.
Are you interested?

20:39.038 --> 20:41.207
I'm interested.

20:42.374 --> 20:43.943
I'll take five tickets.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.312
I guess we'll see
if he learned
anything in class.

20:46.312 --> 20:47.346
I don't see why

20:47.346 --> 20:50.049
a guy who looks
like that even
needs magic.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.283
Thank you very much.

20:51.283 --> 20:54.954
No, thank you.

20:58.491 --> 21:02.027
If you want a kiss,
I need dinner and a movie.

21:02.027 --> 21:02.962
Where's the girl?

21:02.962 --> 21:04.730
In your sick little mind.

21:04.730 --> 21:05.698
Now give me 50 laps

21:05.698 --> 21:07.366
and take a cold shower.

21:07.366 --> 21:10.102
And... I'm keeping
the five smackeroos.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.171
Man...

21:14.607 --> 21:17.409
Well, I can't say I like
your tactics very much

21:17.409 --> 21:19.178
but you made
your point.

21:19.178 --> 21:22.214
However, I refuse
to give up on Sean.

21:22.214 --> 21:25.050
Hexton, you're softer
than a chewed-up slipper.

21:25.050 --> 21:28.120
Which reminds me,
my gums are killing me.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.121
How about that dental plan?
