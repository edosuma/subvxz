00:01.668 --> 00:03.545
Hey. What the hell is this?

00:03.602 --> 00:05.879
I'm guessing it's my latest
budget cut proposal,

00:05.939 --> 00:07.543
based on your rage sweat.

00:07.707 --> 00:09.380
First of all,
lam rage glowing.

00:09.442 --> 00:11.388
Second,
you want to cut funding

00:11.511 --> 00:13.491
for the Pawnee
Palms Public Putt-Putt?

00:13.546 --> 00:15.253
What did the PPPPP
ever do to you?

00:15.315 --> 00:17.955
Ron is very anti-government,
and he has that philosophy.

00:18.051 --> 00:19.689
But there are just certain
things that you don't cut.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.164
Schools. Police. Mini-golf.

00:21.221 --> 00:24.998
Merry-go-rounds. Parades. Gazebo repair.
Roads and bridges. Whatever.

00:25.091 --> 00:27.367
Pretty gardens.
Hummingbird feeders.

00:27.427 --> 00:30.306
I believe in cutting
useless government projects.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.900
I also believe in
cutting useful projects,

00:33.033 --> 00:35.604
future projects,
and past projects.

00:35.668 --> 00:37.443
The Hoover Dam is a travesty.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.710
You also believe
in making furniture.

00:39.839 --> 00:42.012
Why don't you go
solder a chair instead?

00:42.175 --> 00:44.177
Do you expect me
to make a chair

00:44.310 --> 00:46.312
out of transistor
chips and small wires?

00:46.413 --> 00:48.393
Look, the defunding
of the mini-golf course

00:48.448 --> 00:51.156
is on the agenda for the city
council meeting tomorrow.

00:51.217 --> 00:54.198
I'm sure you'll argue against
it with your trademark vigor.

00:54.254 --> 00:56.564
Oh, I will argue.
And I'm going to win.

00:56.623 --> 00:59.934
That Putt-Putt is going to be around forever.
And when I am done with it,

00:59.993 --> 01:03.031
it will attract more visitors
than the Hoover Dam.

01:03.163 --> 01:06.167
And it will produce double
the amount of electricity.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.768
How?
I'll figure it out.

01:07.834 --> 01:09.438
It already has windmills.
Who cares?

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:29.989 --> 01:32.765
Councilmen. I have something to
discuss with you. But before I do,

01:32.826 --> 01:36.672
can I just point out how handsome
the both of you look today?

01:36.796 --> 01:38.673
Yeah, I know.
Oh, I feel very ill.

01:38.731 --> 01:40.267
Okay. Well, tomorrow,
we are voting

01:40.400 --> 01:41.936
on funding for
the mini-golf course.

01:42.001 --> 01:45.244
And personally, I think it is great for
families, it's a great job creator,

01:45.305 --> 01:47.478
and it's extremely cute.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.247
I'm wondering which way
you two are leaning.

01:49.309 --> 01:52.313
Uh, last time I was there,
I saw kids of all races,

01:52.378 --> 01:56.019
getting along and playing.
It was terrible.

01:56.082 --> 01:57.652
So, I'm voting
to get rid of it.

01:57.984 --> 01:59.725
At least you have
a good reason.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.858
Well, Howser is with me.
Milton is with Dexhart.

02:02.922 --> 02:04.458
Jeremy,
you're the swing vote.

02:04.524 --> 02:06.060
What do you think?
Hmm.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.265
Well, on the one hand, I love
cutting government programs.

02:09.362 --> 02:11.865
On the other hand,
mini-golf rules.

02:11.931 --> 02:15.140
And on the third hand, I hate
both you and Ron Swanson.

02:15.235 --> 02:17.044
So, this one
could go either way.

02:17.170 --> 02:19.013
I'm kind of
a badass wild card.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.376
Hey, what are you
doing tonight?

02:21.474 --> 02:23.784
More like
who am I doing.

02:24.043 --> 02:25.044
(CHUCKLES)

02:26.479 --> 02:28.152
No one. I'm free.
What's up?

(BAND PLAYING ROCK MUSIC)

02:29.716 --> 02:31.696
Can I get two beers and an ice
water for my friend here?

02:31.751 --> 02:33.230
Designated driver.

02:33.286 --> 02:35.163
I am? You drove here.

02:35.221 --> 02:36.859
Ah, it's too late, bro.
I already ordered the water.

02:36.923 --> 02:38.231
I don't know what
you want me to do.

02:38.291 --> 02:41.465
Andy and I just closed a big donation
to the Redwood Music Program.

02:41.528 --> 02:46.102
A charity he discovered. So, I suggested
we all go out for a celebratory drink.

02:46.166 --> 02:50.308
And somehow, I just ended up
becoming the designated driver.

02:50.370 --> 02:55.285
And paying for everyone. And I
didn't get to choose the bar.

02:55.542 --> 02:57.215
I should be more assertive.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.380
Oh. (LAUGHS)

03:00.446 --> 03:03.256
The band is moving me tonight.
It's really good.

03:03.316 --> 03:05.159
Really? They sound
kind of crappy to me.

03:05.218 --> 03:07.391
Kind of sounds like
one of your songs, babe.

03:07.453 --> 03:09.763
Well, you know what? Mouse Rat
has a lot of influence on

03:09.822 --> 03:11.062
some of the local
high school bands.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.468
Mostly because Chang buys them
beer and what-not.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.733
Wait. Andy,
this is a Mouse Rat song.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.708
That's my band. I didn't
recognize us without me

03:20.800 --> 03:21.801
because I'm the only
one that matters.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.439
Thank you, everyone.
We are Rat Mouse.

03:24.537 --> 03:28.007
Rat Mouse? Rat bastard.
They're playing without me?

03:28.107 --> 03:29.916
That's a song I wrote!

03:30.777 --> 03:33.018
Hey, baby. Can I borrow
your car for a month?

03:33.079 --> 03:34.649
I already lent
you my car.

03:34.714 --> 03:35.852
Do you not know
where my car is?

03:35.915 --> 03:38.987
Ugh! I'm so sick of the third degree.
It's like dating a cop.

03:39.085 --> 03:40.428
I'm gassy.
Let's make out.

03:40.553 --> 03:41.896
What?

03:41.955 --> 03:44.196
Yeah. Move aside.

03:44.257 --> 03:49.172
Dating Mona-Lisa is awesome. Except that
I live in constant fear for my life.

03:49.362 --> 03:51.740
So, I guess it's time
to do the mature thing

03:51.798 --> 03:54.472
and have someone else
dump her for me.

03:54.634 --> 03:57.547
Uh, Perkins, sit down.
I just heard that you and

03:57.670 --> 04:00.583
Traeger might be
getting back together.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.948
Yeah. It's funny, right?

04:02.041 --> 04:04.078
I mean, we're already planning
on having a baby together.

04:04.143 --> 04:05.781
We're not quite a couple,
but...

04:05.845 --> 04:07.791
Yeah, cool, congrats.
Listen, I need your help.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.257
My girlfriend is crazy.

04:09.315 --> 04:12.387
You say that about every girl you date.
You said that about me.

04:12.452 --> 04:14.056
Calm down, Ann.
You're proving my point.

04:14.387 --> 04:16.094
Seriously,
Mona-Lisa is legit insane.

04:16.221 --> 04:17.963
She almost jumped
out of a moving car

04:18.024 --> 04:21.267
to buy a Nicki Minaj poster. Can
you break up with her for me?

04:21.394 --> 04:23.704
I'm not going to
dump a girl for you.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.403
I'll give you that chenille
blanket of mine you love so much.

04:26.466 --> 04:27.501
Deal.
Ugh!

04:27.634 --> 04:28.704
But that's my
favorite blankie.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.577
Won't you do it for free?
Nope.

Fine.

Okay, I need to have Jamm
fall in love with this place.

04:40.079 --> 04:43.117
So, I'm rolling out the red carpet.
I need you to stay upbeat,

04:43.182 --> 04:44.855
keep things light.
Absolutely.

04:44.984 --> 04:46.691
I can be a sort of...

04:47.053 --> 04:48.396
Conversational lubricant.

04:48.554 --> 04:51.296
Yeah, there's probably a less
gross way to say it. But, sure.

<i>CHRIS: I love being a caddy.</i>

04:52.825 --> 04:56.068
(LAUGHS) It's so much more
than just carrying clubs.

04:56.262 --> 04:58.674
It's about offering
positive reinforcement.

04:58.931 --> 05:01.969
I consider myself a caddy
to everyone in my life.

05:02.602 --> 05:04.707
Nice shot!

05:04.771 --> 05:06.216
Great sweeping.

05:06.272 --> 05:07.876
Way to be, duck.

05:09.509 --> 05:11.079

nice putter.

05:11.210 --> 05:12.814
Oh, thank you very much.

05:12.879 --> 05:15.257
Some fat Hawaiian guy
left it in my waiting room.

05:15.348 --> 05:16.850
When he came back,
I was all like,

05:16.916 --> 05:20.625
"Oh, uh, yeah. Yeah, I haven't seen it.
I don't know." (LAUGHS)

05:20.687 --> 05:22.223
Classic.
(LAUGHS)

05:22.355 --> 05:23.925

05:24.057 --> 05:26.264
Okay. Before we start,
anybody want a hot dog?

Hot dogs? You know I have irritable
bowel syndrome, you racist.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.977
Yikes. Okay.
How about a snow cone? On me.

Hello, Councilman.

05:34.133 --> 05:36.909
Chris. Leslie. Snow Cone Lady.

05:37.103 --> 05:40.880
I see you're about to play a round
of publicly-subsidized mini-golf.

05:41.307 --> 05:42.581
Mind if I join you?

05:44.410 --> 05:47.550
Well, hello, Burly. Chang.

05:47.613 --> 05:48.614
Hey, man. What's up?

05:48.681 --> 05:50.558
I was just over at the bar,

05:50.616 --> 05:52.425
enjoying a wonderful night
with my co-workers,

05:52.485 --> 05:53.657
who all talked about
how awesome I was.

05:53.786 --> 05:54.992
And I look up,
and what do I see?

05:55.054 --> 05:57.694
A band. But you're missing something.
Like, oh, I don't know,

05:57.757 --> 06:02.365
your lead singer/songwriter!
tee-shirt designer/nacho chef.

06:02.428 --> 06:03.429
What's up?

06:03.496 --> 06:05.032
First of all,
your nachos are terrible.

06:05.164 --> 06:06.734
No one's had
the guts to tell you.

06:06.799 --> 06:08.335
Why don't you
melt the cheese?

06:09.035 --> 06:11.174
(SCOFFS) We tried to tell
you about the show, man.

06:11.237 --> 06:13.012
I called your cell,
like, 20 times.

06:13.072 --> 06:16.918
Well, I dropped my cell phone in a
bowl of cereal last week, you idiot.

06:16.976 --> 06:19.217
You bother to call me,
you'd have known that.

06:19.278 --> 06:22.919
Maybe you should change your name
to Burly and the Backstabbers.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.024
That's a pretty
good name, actually.

06:25.084 --> 06:27.428
Yeah, he's really good
at coming up with names.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.795
Get me a Budweiser
Black Crown.

06:29.856 --> 06:32.632
You guys got Black Crown here?
If not, you should.

06:32.692 --> 06:34.035
Ron, are you going
to be joining us?

06:34.093 --> 06:35.470
I won't be playing.

06:35.528 --> 06:37.599
I'm simply here to
remind Councilman Jamm

06:37.730 --> 06:39.801
that this ridiculous
play palace

06:39.866 --> 06:42.472
costs the taxpayers
thousands of dollars a year.

06:42.568 --> 06:45.811
What a bargain. I mean,
kids love it, adults love it,

06:45.872 --> 06:47.408
Jamm loves it.
Everybody loves it.

06:47.507 --> 06:49.350
It's, like,
the Toy Story <i>3</i> of places.

06:49.509 --> 06:51.750
Yeah, she's right, Swanson.
I do love it.

06:51.811 --> 06:55.349
You should relax a little. Have a snow cone.
Leslie's buying all night.

06:55.448 --> 06:57.587
You don't say.
She's buying you snow cones,

06:57.717 --> 06:59.890
and tomorrow,
you're voting on an issue

06:59.986 --> 07:01.090
that she cares about.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.300
Hey. Guys. What, are we going
to stand around all day

07:03.356 --> 07:06.860

unrelated facts about... (MUMBLES)

07:06.926 --> 07:08.997
Or are we going to play?
Game on.

07:09.128 --> 07:12.632

gave us free Mylar balloons.

I got dibs on
the dinosaur.

07:15.067 --> 07:17.104

I want all of them.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.979
You got them.
Sweet.

07:21.674 --> 07:24.314
The Councilman is away.
Good luck to you both.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.186
Luck has nothing to
do with it, Chris.

07:29.248 --> 07:30.522
Yeah, I can be a pro.

07:30.583 --> 07:33.496
Wow, you are on fire, Jeremy.
Having fun?

07:33.553 --> 07:37.057
Mmm-hmm. I think this proves
that this is a wonderful place

07:37.123 --> 07:38.898
that brings joy
to people's lives

07:39.025 --> 07:40.834
and brings
the community together.

07:40.893 --> 07:45.706

taxpayer $9,000 in annual subsidies.

On to the next hole.

to get a vote.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.320
And worse,
you're deliberately losing.

08:03.382 --> 08:06.056
I am not deliberately losing.
I'm having a very off night.

08:06.118 --> 08:08.291
Losing on purpose
is a form of lying.

08:08.855 --> 08:10.630
You're only as
good as your word.

08:10.690 --> 08:13.796
You want a word, Ron?
I have a word for you.

08:13.860 --> 08:16.101
I will do anything I can
to get Jamm's vote

08:16.162 --> 08:17.470
so that he will
keep this course open

08:17.597 --> 08:18.905
and it will be good
for the community.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.274

Shut up.

do not want to fight. No.

to you woman to woman.

Tom pretty well.

08:40.686 --> 08:41.892
Do you know his ATM pin?

from Diddy's lnstagram.

still in front of me?

09:08.314 --> 09:11.727
I'm done with that band. I mean,
I'm an adult now. You know?

09:11.784 --> 09:14.526
I work two part-time jobs.
Hello.

09:14.587 --> 09:16.362
I don't need the stress
of playing guitar

09:16.489 --> 09:18.298
with my friends
every few weeks.

09:18.357 --> 09:22.737
Yeah. Plus, look how bad they are without you.
Burly is terrible.

09:22.795 --> 09:26.242
He actually has a really beautiful voice.
For a backup singer.

09:26.599 --> 09:28.078
Right. That's what I meant.

09:28.134 --> 09:32.082
I love Andy, but to be perfectly honest,
Mouse Rat's music is not my thing.

09:32.204 --> 09:34.582
I really only listen to,
like, German Death Reggae

09:34.807 --> 09:37.754
and Halloween Sound Effects
records from the 1950s.

09:37.810 --> 09:40.188
And Bette Midler,
obviously.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.192
You know what?
I'm retiring from music.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.693
Andy. Andy.

09:43.749 --> 09:49.028
Done. But not without, first,
a monster farewell performance

09:49.088 --> 09:51.625
solo on this stage tonight.

09:51.724 --> 09:54.568
Everybody, I'm going to show these
idiots what a big mistake they made.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.037
I need a piece of paper,
I need a pen,

09:56.095 --> 09:58.473
I need four more beers,
I need a computer fan,

09:58.598 --> 10:01.340
I need a lightning bolt of inspiration.
It's songwriting time.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.346
What do you need
a computer fan for?

10:03.502 --> 10:06.642
Sometimes, when you use
a computer, it gets hot.

10:06.706 --> 10:07.912
And the fan cools it down.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.512
You know, I think it's
great that you're cool

10:12.645 --> 10:14.147
with Tom's
financial situation.

10:14.213 --> 10:17.660
What are you talking about? Tommy
owns his own business. (LAUGHS)

10:17.717 --> 10:20.891
Yeah, but he had to borrow
a lot of money, and...

10:21.053 --> 10:24.830
When you're not around,
Tom drinks tap water.

10:25.224 --> 10:26.225
What?

10:26.559 --> 10:29.631
Excuse me.
You're broke?

10:29.695 --> 10:32.471
Uh, yeah. Super broke.
Are you upset about that?

10:32.698 --> 10:35.372
Mmm, yeah. Because I
don't F with poor-sies.

10:35.434 --> 10:39.940
But thanks to a warning from my new
best friend, I don't have to. Okay?

10:40.006 --> 10:41.815
We're done. You're awesome.

10:41.874 --> 10:44.252
And I don't even usually like
Puerto Rican chicks.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.551
I'm not... I mean, it
shouldn't matter, but I am...

10:46.612 --> 10:49.149
You're breaking up with me?
Oh, man, that sucks.

10:49.215 --> 10:52.219
That's right.
It's over. Let's go dance.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.489
(QUIETLY) Help.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.662
Ugh! I cannot catch a break.

10:58.724 --> 11:00.260
You better find
your stroke, Knope.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.328
Guys, I'm going to
let Julie go home.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.466
It's getting late, and Jeremy
has eaten all the syrup.

11:04.730 --> 11:06.505
Thank you. It's been an honor
working alongside you.

11:06.565 --> 11:08.476
Thanks. JAMM: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up.

11:08.534 --> 11:10.138
Snow cones are half the fun.

11:10.202 --> 11:11.647
Yeah. Julie,
could you stay, please?

11:11.737 --> 11:13.683
I have calculus homework. I...

11:13.806 --> 11:15.752
Oh, well, math is
worthless in real life.

11:15.808 --> 11:19.051
I mean, there's an app for calculating tips.
That's all you need.

11:19.111 --> 11:21.785
Math is very important. Especially
for young women. Stay in school.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.384
I've made my point.
Leslie has made hers.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.054
Which way are you voting,
Councilman?

11:27.119 --> 11:30.760
Uh, well, I'm kind of still on the
fence about this budget thing.

11:30.823 --> 11:32.996
But I do love watching you
guys squabble over me.

11:33.059 --> 11:35.039
You sure make a guy
feel like a real lady.

11:35.394 --> 11:36.429
Weird.

11:36.495 --> 11:37.496
All right, how about this?

11:37.563 --> 11:40.339
You two play each other.
Nine holes.

11:40.399 --> 11:41.639
Winner gets my vote.

11:42.101 --> 11:43.375
I'm game. Ron?

11:43.502 --> 11:46.779
An athletic competition where both
parties are competing their hardest

11:46.839 --> 11:50.150
is certainly more honorable
than whatever this charade is.

11:50.376 --> 11:53.653
A sudden death playoff, on the very
course that hangs in the balance.

11:53.913 --> 11:57.486
I could literally faint if I didn't
have impeccable blood pressure.

11:57.583 --> 11:58.584
(CRACKS KNUCKLES)

11:59.685 --> 12:02.359
Oh, hey, everybody.
My name is Andy Dwyer.

12:02.421 --> 12:04.924
You probably know me
as the artist formerly

12:05.057 --> 12:07.560
known as the lead
singer of Mouse Rat.

12:07.626 --> 12:11.904
Well, after tonight, you'll only
know me as the former artist

12:11.964 --> 12:14.240
formerly known
as the lead singer

12:14.366 --> 12:16.642
of Mouse Rat.
I'm retiring from music.

12:16.836 --> 12:19.680
This is my swan song.

12:23.275 --> 12:25.778
(SINGING)
<i>Once, there was a golden swan</i>

12:26.245 --> 12:30.455
<i>A swan of a man
Now, that swan's name was Andy</i>

12:30.516 --> 12:33.360
<i>And he started
a rock and roll band</i>

12:33.619 --> 12:35.929
<i>He made incredible nachos</i>

12:36.088 --> 12:38.625
<i>That everybody
claimed they loved</i>

12:38.691 --> 12:40.967
<i>And then,
the bandmates dicked him over</i>

12:41.026 --> 12:44.974
<i>With a massive
rock and roll shove</i>

12:45.097 --> 12:49.204
<i>This is my swan song
Watch me fly</i>

12:50.336 --> 12:52.316
Tom.
What happened to you?

12:52.371 --> 12:55.045
Mona-Lisa happened to me.
She covered me in glitter

12:55.107 --> 12:57.951
and Anna Nicole body spray. Why
do they still even make that?

12:58.010 --> 12:59.819
They don't. She's had the
same bottle for years.

12:59.879 --> 13:01.620
She just mixes in
water and baby oil.

13:01.714 --> 13:03.284
Now, it's your turn
to help me.

13:03.349 --> 13:05.852
Okay, you need to break things
off with me and Mona-Lisa.

13:05.918 --> 13:08.831
Uh... Ann, this might be a battle
you need to fight yourself.

13:08.888 --> 13:11.300
I try not to get involved in other
people's personal relationships.

13:11.357 --> 13:12.734
Ah! Don't hurt me!

13:12.792 --> 13:14.294
Get me out of
this friendship.

13:14.493 --> 13:18.236

I can be the beautiful duckling</i>

13:18.697 --> 13:20.836

13:25.638 --> 13:27.709

13:28.474 --> 13:30.784
<i>Ah</i>

13:30.943 --> 13:32.752
<i>Ah...</i>

13:33.379 --> 13:36.952
Why is there a gorilla guarding
this gingerbread house?

13:37.149 --> 13:40.130
Because mini golf is awesome. It's cute
and it's fun and it needs to be saved.

13:40.186 --> 13:42.757
Less talk.
More competing for my vote.

13:45.457 --> 13:46.595
(BELL DINGS)

13:47.159 --> 13:48.433
Wow.

13:48.494 --> 13:52.909
This is it. Ron leads by one. If he
hits the ball into the dragon's mouth,

13:52.965 --> 13:54.137
he gets Jamm's vote.

13:54.233 --> 13:59.273
Uh, bean sprouts. Tofu. Uh, Ralph Nader.
Ayn Rand is a terrible writer.

13:59.371 --> 14:01.578
Don't mess up. Don't mess up.
Don't mess up.

14:03.709 --> 14:04.881
Damn it!

14:05.010 --> 14:07.991
Hole-in-one. Excellent win, Ron.
Even better loss, Leslie.

14:08.047 --> 14:10.653
Ultimately, we learn the most about
ourselves through the losses.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.626
Swanson, I hate you.
Nothing will change that.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.226
But I respect the hell
out of your short game.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.365
You got my vote, hombre.

14:18.958 --> 14:20.699
Hey, you got
a hole in one on 18,

14:20.826 --> 14:22.567
so I'm supposed
to give you this.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.138
No. He gets the dragon, too?

14:25.197 --> 14:28.303
A fine trophy. I think
I'll keep it in the office.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.141
No, you won't. Here, kid.
Want this? Huh?

14:30.202 --> 14:32.273
Yeah.
Take it. Run. Run.

14:35.507 --> 14:37.350
Tom. She's coming. Tom.

14:37.409 --> 14:39.389
Okay. Desperation time.
Follow my lead.

14:39.445 --> 14:42.255
What lead? What do you mean?
What do you... Oh!

14:42.715 --> 14:48.859
What the mother F-ing C-ing S-ing
F-ing K-ing F is going on right now?

14:49.054 --> 14:51.432
Sorry, Mona-Lisa. We can't
keep our hands off each other.

14:51.590 --> 14:52.830
That is accurate.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.600
Oh, it's all
finally very clear.

14:55.661 --> 14:56.901
All the times
that you were like,

14:57.029 --> 14:58.303
<i>"Oh, no, Tom</i> is
<i>no good for you,"</i>

14:58.364 --> 15:01.607
and all the times you tried to break
it off with me? I finally get it.

15:01.667 --> 15:02.702
Mmm-hmm.

15:02.768 --> 15:04.076
You guys want a threesome.

15:04.136 --> 15:07.140
What? No. We do not want
to have a threesome with you.

15:07.206 --> 15:10.710
Well, let's not rush to judgment.
I mean, I say we hear her out.

15:10.809 --> 15:13.915
Gross. Tom, good luck.
You still owe me a blanket.

15:14.146 --> 15:17.218
(LAUGHING) Whoa! She's got
a screw loose, am I right?

15:17.283 --> 15:19.991
Actually, she's not the one in
my life I would call crazy.

15:20.052 --> 15:21.622
Look, I still don't
think we should date.

15:21.687 --> 15:26.102
Oh, me, neither. I've been single for
an hour now and it's the tits. (LAUGHS)

15:26.158 --> 15:27.569
I'd still like
to hook up though.

15:28.227 --> 15:29.535
Yo.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.633
Do you want to have
a threesome with us?

15:32.998 --> 15:33.999
Yeah, okay.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.440
Cool.
Sweet.

All right. Yo, what up?
My name's Mona-Lisa.

15:39.471 --> 15:43.146
Well, hello, fellow employees.
Co-workers. I bid you adieu.

15:43.208 --> 15:44.949
Whoa. Fancy Andy.

15:45.010 --> 15:48.014
Oh, me? No. This is
just how I dress now.

15:48.080 --> 15:52.392
Funny, goofball, music Andy
(BLOWS RASPBERRY) is gone.

15:53.919 --> 15:56.957
You're left with the professional remains.
I'm an adult now.

15:57.022 --> 15:58.592
I'm going to focus on business.
Which is good.

15:58.724 --> 16:00.601
Give me more time
to play video games.

16:00.759 --> 16:05.708
Babe, you love that band.
That I also love so much.

16:06.198 --> 16:08.075
They're important to you.

16:08.334 --> 16:10.507
Come on. Call Burly and ask
them to let you back in.

16:10.569 --> 16:12.139
Why, so they can
steal my Swan Song?

16:12.204 --> 16:14.514
Ha, joke's on them.
I forgot it.

16:14.740 --> 16:16.879
No. Business is my life now.

16:17.543 --> 16:18.920
Okay. What's in there?

16:19.044 --> 16:20.421
I don't know.
It's locked.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.250
Yeah. That's my briefcase.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.520
Is it?

16:25.017 --> 16:26.826
Good gravy.
Oh, hello, Ron.

16:26.885 --> 16:28.796
I believe you
know this gorilla.

16:28.854 --> 16:31.198
It used to bring joy to
hundreds of Pawnee families.

16:31.256 --> 16:33.429
But then, you got rid of
its habitat, so it died.

16:33.525 --> 16:35.801
Your office shall
serve as its monkey tomb.

16:35.861 --> 16:37.238

pay for this?

Irrelevant. I would pay any amount
of money to properly shame you.

set of principles.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.748
And I do not
deviate from them.

16:46.805 --> 16:49.684
Right. I mean, God forbid
you're flexible in any way.

16:49.775 --> 16:53.621
You should just stick to your stupid,
rigid, anti-government principles.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.215
But you know what?
Those principles stink.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.883
They're not
the right principles.

16:56.949 --> 16:59.156
You may think so.
I do not.

16:59.418 --> 17:02.661
Thank you for my new silverback friend.
I like him very much.

17:03.188 --> 17:07.329

Well, Mona-Lisa and the random
girl she grabbed after you left

17:21.540 --> 17:23.611
got into a fistfight
in the parking lot.

17:23.675 --> 17:27.020
Eventually, Mona-Lisa threw a cinder
block through the girl's windshield.

17:27.146 --> 17:30.150
She dives in, steals her purse,
doesn't go for the money,

17:30.215 --> 17:31.751
steals all her birth
control pills, and says,

17:31.817 --> 17:33.319
"Bitch, you're
going to get pregnant."

17:33.585 --> 17:35.496
She then pretends
those are Ecstasy

17:35.621 --> 17:37.532
and sells it to
a bunch of college kids

17:37.589 --> 17:39.830
that are drinking Goldschlager
at a gas station.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.803
You have to break up with her.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.397
I tried. Again.
It did not go well.

17:44.530 --> 17:45.531
Did she assault you?

17:45.597 --> 17:48.134
No. This was a sexual injury.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.338
Okay, gross.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.381
Anyway, here's
your chenille blanket.

17:51.503 --> 17:53.483

I will.

brushed regularly.

Never use a lint roller.
I'm dead serious.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.622
Okay. And keep it out
of direct sunlight.

at one picnic...

18:04.817 --> 18:06.296

Well, I was. But it doesn't
have to go down that way.

18:40.619 --> 18:45.034
Last night, you bring in a teenage
girl to pump me full of snow cones.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.134
This is simply how
people like us operate.

18:50.395 --> 18:52.102
I have six things
to say to you.

18:52.164 --> 18:55.111
One, you drive me nuts
with your rigid code of honor.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.477
Two, congratulations.
Putt-Putt has been defunded,

18:57.536 --> 18:59.948
and only because Jamm was
going to double-cross you

19:00.005 --> 19:01.484
and I made him
stick to his word.

19:01.540 --> 19:04.419
Three, I am furious that
Putt-Putt has been defunded.

19:04.510 --> 19:07.116
Four, I am sorry that I said the
gorilla's blood was on your hands.

19:07.179 --> 19:08.590
'Twas Leslie killed the beast.

19:08.780 --> 19:11.260
Five, Putt-Putt is for children
and they are the future

19:11.316 --> 19:12.693
and I have already
written a ballot measure

19:12.818 --> 19:14.195
that will save it
and it will pass.

19:14.286 --> 19:18.132
And six, your rigid code of
honor, which drives me nuts,

19:18.190 --> 19:19.464
makes you
a wonderful human being

19:19.591 --> 19:20.865
and I am proud to
call you my friend

19:20.926 --> 19:22.337
and don't ever change.

19:22.828 --> 19:23.829
You want a drink?

19:23.896 --> 19:24.897
Very much.

19:29.101 --> 19:31.707
Burly. I just want
to say I'm sorry.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.408
That I haven't
been to rehearsal,

19:33.539 --> 19:35.212
and that I won't let
you sing or write songs

19:35.307 --> 19:37.048
or walk out on
stage in front of me.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.180
I love playing
with you guys

19:39.244 --> 19:41.190
and I want back in.
If you'll let me.

19:41.246 --> 19:42.623
Well, we never wanted
to kick you out.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.820
It's just, you didn't show up for
practice, and we like to play.

19:44.883 --> 19:46.191
Right.

19:46.318 --> 19:47.661
If you want to
come back in, you can.

19:47.719 --> 19:49.426
I'm more of
a backup singer, anyways.

19:49.488 --> 19:50.660
You can say that again.

19:50.722 --> 19:52.565
No, hey.
You've got a great voice.

19:52.624 --> 19:55.002
Yeah, Ben.
God. Don't say that.

19:55.060 --> 19:56.869
Welcome back, buddy.
Yes.

19:56.995 --> 19:58.804
(LAUGHS) All right.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.740
Hey, I'll even try melting
the cheese on the nachos.

20:00.799 --> 20:01.869
All right.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.175
It won't work. You're going
to look like such an idiot.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.507
I have been in the city
council for almost a year.

20:07.573 --> 20:08.881
And I'm proud of
what I've done.

20:08.974 --> 20:12.512
But every once in a while, I end up in a
situation that makes my stomach queasy.

20:12.578 --> 20:14.819
You're in politics.
What did you expect?

20:14.880 --> 20:16.985
Frankly, I hoped it would
be like dealing with you.

20:17.049 --> 20:21.122
People with strong opinions
hashing it out respectfully.

20:21.253 --> 20:23.529
And then, you either
realize that I'm right

20:23.622 --> 20:25.568
or you get hungry
and go home and I win.

20:25.657 --> 20:29.730
There are a lot of Jeremy Jamms
along the path you're walking.

20:29.795 --> 20:32.537
I suppose you just need to
figure out whether that's a path

20:32.598 --> 20:33.941
you truly want to walk.

20:34.199 --> 20:35.303
Yeah.

20:36.935 --> 20:38.505
I'm taking that gorilla
with me and putting it

20:38.637 --> 20:40.241
back in the Putt-Putt
when it re-opens.

20:40.305 --> 20:42.046
Sorry, no.

20:42.341 --> 20:44.446
That gorilla was
a gift from a very

20:44.576 --> 20:46.715
determined coworker
whom I respect.

20:46.812 --> 20:50.350
And there's a certain code of honor
that accompanies gift-giving.

20:50.449 --> 20:52.326
God, you're the worst.

20:55.187 --> 20:58.191
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to Mouse Rat's reunion show.

20:58.257 --> 21:03.036
Featuring me, Andy Dwyer, and, for the
first time, Andrew "Burly" Burlenson

21:03.095 --> 21:06.440
on lead vocals. That's right.
Two lead vocalists.

21:06.498 --> 21:09.172
Name one other
band that's done that.

21:09.234 --> 21:10.645
The Beatles!

21:12.137 --> 21:13.548
Three, four!

21:17.409 --> 21:20.356
(SINGING) <i>Well, I know
we had bad times</i>

21:20.912 --> 21:24.382
<i>But we had good times, too</i>
