00:05.833 --> 00:10.333
NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:14.208 --> 00:15.750
[narrator] 1967.

00:16.791 --> 00:18.291
The Summer of Love.

00:19.333 --> 00:22.625
But can the idea of love
and peace really bring about change

00:22.708 --> 00:24.666
to a world living on the edge of war?

00:26.791 --> 00:30.833
In the Middle East, long-simmering
tensions are about to burst into flames.

00:32.208 --> 00:34.666
Egypt's popular President,
Gamal Abdel Nasser,

00:35.583 --> 00:39.750
gathers the entire Arab nations
to join him in war against Israel.

00:41.750 --> 00:46.458
Nasser blocks Israel's shipping channels
through the Straits of Tiran.

00:48.541 --> 00:50.458
War seems inevitable.

00:50.833 --> 00:53.875
Israel responds
with a devastating surprise attack.

00:54.625 --> 00:55.458
[bomb explodes]

00:55.541 --> 00:57.500
Within a matter of a few hours,

00:57.583 --> 00:59.916
the entire Egyptian Air Force
is destroyed.

01:01.083 --> 01:04.208
Despite Syria and Jordan coming
to Egypt's aid,

01:04.291 --> 01:05.916
fighting on three fronts...

01:06.750 --> 01:09.750
Israel goes on to win the war
in only six days.

01:11.500 --> 01:15.875
The Sinai Peninsula,
Golan Heights, and the West Bank,

01:15.958 --> 01:18.125
including East Jerusalem, fall to Israel.

01:20.125 --> 01:23.625
As the Arab nations plot
to regain their lost territories,

01:23.958 --> 01:26.708
certain Palestinian nationalist groups,

01:26.791 --> 01:30.083
living under Israeli rule
in the occupied territories...

01:30.458 --> 01:32.416
start to plan their retaliation.

01:40.041 --> 01:41.916
[airplane approaching]

01:57.583 --> 02:01.291
[flight announcement in Italian]

02:01.791 --> 02:03.833
What is your business in Rome, sir?

02:04.708 --> 02:06.791
I'm here in an official capacity.

02:08.791 --> 02:12.166
Please remind those two gentlemen
that's all diplomatic luggage.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.875
[people chattering in Italian]

02:16.333 --> 02:18.166
[in Italian] Guys, leave those suitcases.

02:18.250 --> 02:20.583
-He has a diplomatic passport.
-No problem.

02:24.541 --> 02:26.708
-Enjoy your stay in Rome, Mr. Marwan.
-Thank you.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.083
[people chattering]

02:38.500 --> 02:40.500
[announcement]

02:51.625 --> 02:53.500
[engine starts]

02:59.958 --> 03:02.000
[men chatting indistinctly]

03:12.041 --> 03:14.416
[in Arabic] Glory to Allah.

03:16.708 --> 03:17.625
Magnificent.

03:19.125 --> 03:20.166
[man] Magnificent.

03:24.375 --> 03:30.000
[announcement in Italian] Flight 136
to Tel Aviv is now boarding.

03:36.625 --> 03:41.458
[tense music playing]

03:41.666 --> 03:44.041
[men conversing indistinctly]

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
[airplane taking off]

03:51.416 --> 03:54.916
-[Marwan] This is where I say good luck.
-[Al-Hindi] Stay until it's over.

03:55.291 --> 03:56.208
[Marwan] Listen to me.

03:56.958 --> 04:00.208
I'm an Egyptian consular official.
I cannot risk remaining here.

04:00.708 --> 04:01.583
Ashraf...

04:03.458 --> 04:09.250
Please send our deepest respect
and thanks to President Sadat.

04:09.416 --> 04:13.666
Tell him we will soon see
a free Palestine.

04:17.750 --> 04:18.750
Good luck.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.375
[airplane flying overhead]

04:24.166 --> 04:26.916
Hello ladies and gentlemen,
this is your Captain speaking:

04:27.291 --> 04:30.750
Flight duration expected
is four hours and ten minutes.

04:30.833 --> 04:33.000
[co-pilot speaking in Hebrew]

04:33.250 --> 04:37.750
[airplane engines whirring]

04:46.208 --> 04:47.333
It's taking off, get ready.

04:48.041 --> 04:50.083
[engine whistling]

04:50.708 --> 04:53.291
[control room official]

04:53.875 --> 04:57.666
-[engines whirring]
-[exhaust buzzing]

05:18.833 --> 05:19.833
Now!

05:21.208 --> 05:22.208
[gunshot]

05:22.750 --> 05:25.833
[thunder rumbling]

05:32.916 --> 05:35.750
[rain falling]

05:46.416 --> 05:48.416
[Arabic music playing]

05:48.500 --> 05:49.833
President Nasser...

05:50.333 --> 05:53.000
Vice President Sadat, you are welcome.

05:53.208 --> 05:54.791
They are ready for you.

05:59.583 --> 06:02.625
[in Arabic] I completely agree with you,
Mr. President.

06:02.708 --> 06:06.416
Abdullah, let's keep it in English
for the benefit of our friends.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.333
Please.

06:07.541 --> 06:09.583
The only question of importance

06:09.666 --> 06:12.708
is the regaining
of our lands seized by Israel.

06:13.541 --> 06:16.000
The problem is not
just the Zionist entity.

06:16.583 --> 06:19.166
The problem is who stands behind Israel.

06:19.458 --> 06:20.500
The United States!

06:20.583 --> 06:23.166
Perhaps, if Israel felt threatened,

06:23.250 --> 06:25.500
constrained
by United Nations resolutions...

06:25.708 --> 06:27.791
We all know that will never happen.

06:28.333 --> 06:32.750
Perhaps the problem is not
who stands behind Israel but behind us.

06:33.041 --> 06:35.791
-[forks and knives clinking]
-[coughs]

06:36.750 --> 06:38.166
As the Soviet Union?

06:38.625 --> 06:39.458
Really?

06:40.875 --> 06:44.500
You presume to enlighten
the men at this table, Ashraf?

06:44.791 --> 06:45.666
[chuckles]

06:47.791 --> 06:51.083
I'm sorry for speaking up,
Mr. President, but in the long run,

06:51.166 --> 06:54.500
the Soviet Union will collapse
as it adheres to a flawed concept--

06:54.583 --> 06:58.166
The Soviet Union is the only power
holding America at bay.

06:58.958 --> 07:01.416
And this is the power you say
is going to crumble?

07:01.791 --> 07:03.041
I believe it will.

07:03.333 --> 07:07.416
Their system does not reward a man's
individual initiative and accomplishments.

07:07.791 --> 07:10.416
So we need is the support
of countries that will survive,

07:10.500 --> 07:12.083
notably the United States.

07:12.416 --> 07:14.416
We know they do not want Israel attacked.

07:14.708 --> 07:17.958
What if the Arab states offered
to the US not to attack Israel

07:18.041 --> 07:21.875
in return for their economic support,
much more than the Soviets now provide?

07:21.958 --> 07:24.500
But what about your lands?

07:24.791 --> 07:26.125
What's more important?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.500
Our land or our people?

07:29.041 --> 07:31.875
Let's contact the Americans,
shift away from the Soviets

07:31.958 --> 07:34.541
and broker the deal
between us and the Israelis.

07:36.500 --> 07:37.875
[in Arabic] I suppose

07:37.958 --> 07:40.666
I could appoint my son-in-law
as the new American Ambassador.

07:41.166 --> 07:42.416
[laughing]

07:42.583 --> 07:45.625
[Nasser] And head negotiator
of the Israeli peace process.

07:45.916 --> 07:47.833
A real visionary.

07:47.916 --> 07:49.500
-Right, Sharaf?
-[guests chuckle]

07:50.333 --> 07:51.208
[scoffs]

07:51.666 --> 07:55.708
You know, Mr. Eastwood, Egypt's vineyards
date back to the days of the Pharaohs.

07:55.791 --> 07:56.875
[whispering inaudibly]

07:56.958 --> 07:58.583
What do you think of the wine?

07:58.833 --> 08:01.833
I had no idea that Egypt
had produced such a gem.

08:02.458 --> 08:03.958
A toast to friends.

08:04.666 --> 08:06.958
May we all be healthy and victorious.

08:07.250 --> 08:08.708
[all] Sa-Hit-kum.

08:08.875 --> 08:09.916
Cheers.

08:11.083 --> 08:12.833
And to my beautiful daughter, Mona.

08:13.166 --> 08:14.708
The joy of my heart.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.416
I'm so happy to be here in London
with you.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.083
-Cheers for Mona.
-[all] Cheers for Mona.

08:23.833 --> 08:27.541
-[thunder rumbling]
-[rain falling]

08:28.125 --> 08:31.583
[guests chatting distinctly]

08:32.125 --> 08:34.125
[people laughing]

08:37.625 --> 08:41.500
[Nasser in Arabic] I can't have him
around important guests.

08:41.583 --> 08:45.375
-[Mona] You're speaking about my husband.
-[Nasser] Your husband? Nonsense!

08:45.583 --> 08:47.125
He's a millstone around your neck.

08:47.875 --> 08:51.958
What kind of example
is this man for my grandson?

08:52.875 --> 08:55.833
[Mona] Your grandson, but my son,
and Ashraf is his father!

08:55.958 --> 08:58.916
A deadbeat father.
Better no father at all than that.

08:59.708 --> 09:04.125
I always knew he was an idiot.
And now he embarrasses me at my table.

09:05.083 --> 09:07.583
I should never have approved
this marriage.

09:08.166 --> 09:10.583
[Mona argues indistinctly]

09:16.916 --> 09:17.958
[exhales]

09:36.041 --> 09:37.208
Are you OK?

09:38.916 --> 09:39.916
Ashraf?

09:46.125 --> 09:47.458
I heard what he said to you.

09:48.833 --> 09:50.791
It's nothing I haven't heard before.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.625
So you approve
of the way he humiliates me?

09:53.750 --> 09:56.083
-I didn't say that.
-Then, what is it?

09:56.958 --> 09:59.291
I don't understand his issue with me.

10:00.250 --> 10:03.041
He was upset you expressed
your thoughts at the table. Thst's all.

10:03.208 --> 10:06.791
Mona, he's blinded by his hatred of me.

10:07.083 --> 10:08.708
He shuts me out every time.

10:08.791 --> 10:11.333
-He's a stubborn man.
-His stubbornness...

10:14.666 --> 10:17.333
He sticks to an old philosophy
that obviously failed.

10:19.083 --> 10:20.083
Ashraf...

10:21.083 --> 10:23.916
[in Arabic] take my advice:
be gentler when you are with him.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.125
-Show him you respect him.
-[sighs]

10:26.208 --> 10:30.083
One day, he will accept you as I do
and see the great man that you are.

10:30.291 --> 10:32.166
Trust me,
I will work on him until he does.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.375
I don't look for my daddy
in every man I meet.

10:36.541 --> 10:38.708
My father is my father,
and you are something else.

10:39.541 --> 10:41.583
I love you, Ashraf, just believe that.

10:45.291 --> 10:46.791
Most notably,

10:47.083 --> 10:50.041
the actions of this man, Garbo.

10:50.916 --> 10:52.583
A failed chicken-farmer...

10:53.000 --> 10:56.291
who became the greatest
double agent in history.

10:57.291 --> 11:00.250
Convinced that he needed
to act for the good of humanity,

11:00.333 --> 11:05.125
Garbo set about creating
an imaginary spy ring...

11:05.375 --> 11:08.250
of 27 English agents.

11:08.541 --> 11:10.625
Garbo is now recognized...

11:11.000 --> 11:14.416
as one of the great heroes
of World War II.

11:15.041 --> 11:19.083
A man who, incredibly enough,
was awarded the Iron Cross by Germany

11:19.166 --> 11:22.458
and the Order of the British Empire
by the King.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.375
Bag O' Nails.

11:25.166 --> 11:27.375
Tonight, after the group study.

11:27.708 --> 11:28.708
Are you in?

11:29.166 --> 11:32.375
-Let me talk to my wife.
-It's going to be a wild night.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.041
[lively music playing]

11:38.083 --> 11:41.791
[music gets louder]

11:41.958 --> 11:44.958
[people chatting indistinctly]

12:17.833 --> 12:20.083
-[man] Ashraf! You made it!
-Yes.

12:20.791 --> 12:24.375
I'm so glad you came. Good man. Good man.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.833
-You know Diana Ellis?
-Should I?

12:29.916 --> 12:31.041
Yeah, you should.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.708
-Why do you ask?
-Because she's right behind you.

12:36.791 --> 12:38.250
[Diana] Rory, darling.

12:40.208 --> 12:41.916
Who's your handsome friend?

12:42.458 --> 12:44.750
Ashraf Marwan, Diana Ellis.

12:45.500 --> 12:49.000
-He's the one I told you about.
-[Diane] Oh my, aren't you exotic?

12:49.166 --> 12:50.375
[laughs]

12:50.583 --> 12:51.916
[Diane] Do you like parties?

12:52.250 --> 12:55.083
-Parties? Yes, I like parties.
-Adult parties?

12:55.666 --> 12:57.791
They're at my house. You should come.

12:57.875 --> 13:01.125
Adult parties.
That sounds very... swinging.

13:01.666 --> 13:05.333
-[laughs] I might let you come for free.
-People pay to attend your parties?

13:05.416 --> 13:07.208
That's where the action is

13:07.375 --> 13:09.708
with cameras in the bedroom
so I don't miss a thing.

13:10.250 --> 13:11.666
So, you film your guests?

13:12.208 --> 13:14.000
I like to watch the movies later.

13:15.458 --> 13:17.958
-Can I get anyone a drink?
-Tequila.

13:18.333 --> 13:20.333
[Rory] Tequila! Coming up.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.083
So, what's your story?

13:22.541 --> 13:24.958
Rory says you're the son
of the Egyptian president?

13:25.291 --> 13:26.250
[chuckles]

13:26.458 --> 13:27.458
Son-in-law.

13:28.833 --> 13:31.375
-You're married?
-Yes, I am. Six years.

13:31.583 --> 13:33.541
-Kids?
-I have a little boy.

13:33.791 --> 13:35.125
-Such a waste.
-[chuckles]

13:35.541 --> 13:36.625
[Rory] Here we are.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.250
For you.

13:38.541 --> 13:40.208
-To swinging.
-To swinging.

13:40.291 --> 13:41.291
Cheers.

14:16.166 --> 14:18.000
-[door opens and closes]
-[glasses clinking]

14:24.250 --> 14:26.416
-[in Arabic] Good morning.
-Good morning.

14:27.875 --> 14:28.875
I overslept.

14:30.083 --> 14:31.666
Came back late last night.

14:41.708 --> 14:42.833
Who were you with?

14:43.833 --> 14:45.083
My friends at university.

14:47.625 --> 14:48.625
What's this?

14:49.458 --> 14:50.833
Your tuition bill.

14:58.125 --> 15:00.291
I took care of it already.
No need to worry.

15:02.833 --> 15:03.833
Mona...

15:04.500 --> 15:05.916
is something wrong?

15:07.541 --> 15:08.666
What is it?

15:11.791 --> 15:13.958
Sami Sharaf came by and dropped this off.

15:24.416 --> 15:25.916
[Mona] You're gambling again?

15:27.291 --> 15:30.291
Dancing with that blonde actress
Diana Ellis?

15:31.625 --> 15:33.333
I won't be made to look foolish.

15:36.583 --> 15:37.583
This is wrong.

15:38.083 --> 15:40.041
He sends Sami to spy on me?

15:40.625 --> 15:42.458
On the money, Ashraf, not you.

15:42.583 --> 15:44.541
That's not the reason, and you know it.

15:44.708 --> 15:45.541
Mama.

15:46.666 --> 15:49.958
Oh, what's this? Hey, darling, come here.
Give Daddy a kiss.

15:53.166 --> 15:56.125
[boy murmurs]

15:58.541 --> 15:59.541
Go play.

16:03.708 --> 16:05.833
-Listen, Mona--
-English, Ashraf.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.333
Can't you see what's happening?

16:08.750 --> 16:11.666
Sami is trying to discredit me
in the eyes of your father.

16:11.791 --> 16:13.541
You're doing that all by yourself.

16:15.291 --> 16:18.083
-He's demanding that we return to Egypt.
-What?

16:18.958 --> 16:21.166
-What about my education?
-Your education?

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
[snorts]

16:23.875 --> 16:25.375
Your education in poker?

16:25.583 --> 16:26.583
In drinking?

16:27.875 --> 16:30.208
You know I would do everything
to protect you,

16:30.291 --> 16:32.291
but my father controls our money.

16:34.083 --> 16:35.166

-Ashraf...

16:36.333 --> 16:37.833
he wants me to divorce you.

16:42.166 --> 16:43.166
Divorce?

16:45.958 --> 16:47.375
Is that what you want, Mona?

16:48.125 --> 16:49.125
Huh?

16:50.291 --> 16:51.291
No.

16:52.125 --> 16:53.125
But this...

16:53.833 --> 16:55.125
it needs to stop.

16:56.958 --> 16:59.333
You know I love you,
but you can't lie to me.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.291
I know.

18:42.125 --> 18:44.333
[man] Israeli Embassy,
how may I direct your call?

18:46.458 --> 18:49.041
Michael Comay, Israeli Ambassador, please.

18:49.625 --> 18:51.208
And to whom am I speaking?

18:52.291 --> 18:54.416
I will identify myself to the Ambassador.

18:54.666 --> 18:57.916
I'm afraid I am unable to connect you
without a name, sir.

18:59.833 --> 19:02.000
[breathing heavily]

19:02.166 --> 19:03.041
Sir?

19:04.041 --> 19:06.208
Sir? Are you still there?

19:10.333 --> 19:13.708
-My name is Ashraf Marwan.
-How can I help you, Mr. Marwan?

19:13.958 --> 19:16.791
I have information of interest
to the Intelligence Services,

19:16.875 --> 19:18.833
so I must speak with the Ambassador.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.958
I'm afraid he is not available.

19:22.625 --> 19:24.375
-But if you'd like to leave a--

19:31.083 --> 19:35.125
Now, in its purest form,
potassium is a highly reactive metal.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.541
For those who don't know
how to spell potassium,

19:38.625 --> 19:40.500
write it down, remember it.

19:43.333 --> 19:47.875
When exposed to water,
potassium creates a purple flame.

19:49.291 --> 19:50.291
Why purple?

19:50.708 --> 19:51.875
[door opens]

19:52.125 --> 19:53.125
Anybody?

19:55.458 --> 19:56.500
[door closes]

19:56.791 --> 19:57.791
Excuse me.

19:59.833 --> 20:01.791
[whispers] I'm looking for Ashraf Marwan.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.291
Ashraf Marwan.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.291
Is there an Ashraf Marwan here?

20:18.916 --> 20:20.291
[professor] Ashraf Mar...

20:22.125 --> 20:23.625
Sir, please come down here.

20:49.333 --> 20:50.333
Ashraf Marwan?

20:51.583 --> 20:52.583
Yes?

20:53.541 --> 20:55.208
-Come with us.
-[door opens]

20:57.333 --> 20:58.333
I apologize.

21:23.250 --> 21:24.875
President Nasser...

21:25.833 --> 21:27.666
had a heart attack...

21:29.750 --> 21:30.666
and died.

21:32.958 --> 21:37.041
You and your family are requested
back to Cairo immediately.

21:41.958 --> 21:42.916
He's dead?

21:43.208 --> 21:44.625
Yes, Ashraf.

21:46.166 --> 21:47.583
The President is dead.

[mosque prayer call]

21:58.875 --> 22:02.000
Today, millions of Egyptians came
out on the streets...

22:02.583 --> 22:05.541
to bid farewell
to President Gamal Abdel Nasser.

22:05.625 --> 22:06.958
May he rest in peace.

22:07.375 --> 22:11.708
And Vice President Anwar el Sadat
will be appointed

22:12.375 --> 22:15.416
President of the Arab Republic of Egypt...

22:16.291 --> 22:18.875
a few days
after the official period of mourning.

22:18.958 --> 22:20.583
[prayer song playing]

22:21.666 --> 22:22.916
My condolences.

22:29.416 --> 22:31.041
Mr. President...

22:35.125 --> 22:36.291
I'll be right back.

24:25.250 --> 24:26.083
OK.

25:00.041 --> 25:02.166
[man in Arabic] What is shameful
is denying reality.

25:02.250 --> 25:06.958
The reality is that Israel captured
60,000 square kilometers

25:07.166 --> 25:09.458
of Egyptian land
because of the Six-Day War.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.416
Israel occupies this land today.

25:14.875 --> 25:17.666
This administration's agenda
is to retake it,

25:17.916 --> 25:21.833
so that our people can walk once again
with their heads held high.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.708
Until then...

25:25.250 --> 25:29.666
this map will remind us
of the task at hand.

25:29.833 --> 25:32.750
Our country is not ready for another war.

25:34.083 --> 25:37.125
That is why our only option
to recover the Sinai

25:37.208 --> 25:40.625
is to approach the American
about a diplomatic solution.

25:40.916 --> 25:42.041
Out of the question.

25:42.125 --> 25:44.791
It would jeopardize
the support from the Soviets.

25:45.125 --> 25:46.000
Not necessarily.

25:46.708 --> 25:47.541
Anwar...

25:48.083 --> 25:49.291
what do you suggest?

25:50.291 --> 25:55.125
You will address me as "Mr. President",
Mr. Sami Sharaf.

25:59.583 --> 26:00.583
Mr. President...

26:01.750 --> 26:04.791
I categorically refuse
to endorse this plan!

26:04.916 --> 26:08.500
It is for me to decide what is
in the best interest for Egypt!

26:08.750 --> 26:11.250
Your job is to provide me
with the intelligence

26:11.333 --> 26:15.000
that will enable me to make that decision.
[bangs on table]

26:16.041 --> 26:17.541
Nothing more. [bangs]

26:18.583 --> 26:19.583
Am I clear?

26:20.958 --> 26:22.083
[both] Yes, sir.

26:28.583 --> 26:29.625
Get out.

26:30.291 --> 26:31.291
Out!

26:31.833 --> 26:35.875
With the rise in criticism
of the diplomatic positions

26:35.958 --> 26:39.750
of the government towards Israel,
three ministers resigned today.

26:40.041 --> 26:44.916
This fuels speculations that they may be
preparing to launch a political challenge

26:45.000 --> 26:47.666
against newly sworn-in President Sadat.

26:48.875 --> 26:49.875
Traitors.

Ashraf Marwan is here to see you.

27:17.375 --> 27:18.625
He says it's urgent.

27:20.083 --> 27:21.083
[Sadat] Let him in.

27:21.541 --> 27:22.958
-Turn it off.
-Yes.

27:38.750 --> 27:42.166
What is it that could not wait
until Monday, Ashraf?

27:42.583 --> 27:45.916
Mr. President, I have records for you
of the upmost importance.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.750
Records? What records?

27:48.791 --> 27:52.541
Records containing information
about Sami Sharaf, Gomaa and Sabri.

27:53.791 --> 27:56.916
Records detailing bribery
and corruption at the highest levels.

28:07.625 --> 28:11.000
With respect, they prove one should
not always keep one's enemies closer.

28:11.291 --> 28:13.166
But at least
they are in your possession...

28:14.166 --> 28:16.916
for you to do with as you see fit,
Mr. President.

28:29.333 --> 28:30.625
How did you get them?

28:31.916 --> 28:35.916
-I was looking for something else.
-And what was that?

28:38.083 --> 28:40.416
I won't lie, sir, money has been tight.

28:41.125 --> 28:43.833
I was looking
for financial paperwork for Mona.

28:44.708 --> 28:47.250
To see if there were
any funds we could get.

28:55.250 --> 28:58.000
It's good that you came to me, Ashraf.

28:58.958 --> 29:00.916
This is a matter of the utmost importance.

29:02.750 --> 29:04.125
I want to keep these.

29:05.166 --> 29:07.750
Please, Mr. President,
that's why I am here.

29:08.958 --> 29:10.583
When will you return to London?

29:11.958 --> 29:15.458
It is important for Mona to be close
to her family at this difficult time.

with our son... look at us!

31:07.291 --> 31:09.166
There are better ways to spend our time

31:09.250 --> 31:11.916
than by attending a boring reception
at the embassy.

Ashraf, you have responsibilities,
and we have to go.

31:16.750 --> 31:19.583
What will they do?
I'm part of the government now.

31:20.875 --> 31:25.125
You know, you working in a government
was the last thing I wanted.

31:25.833 --> 31:27.041
But to look at you now,

I couldn't be more proud of my husband.

Israeli Ambassador, please.

My name is Ashraf Marwan.

32:06.416 --> 32:08.291
How can I help you, Mr. Marwan?

32:08.750 --> 32:11.666
[Ashraf] I have information of interest
to the Intelligence Services,

32:11.750 --> 32:13.875
so I must speak with the ambassador.

32:16.375 --> 32:19.791

to accept your offer, Mr. Marwan.

32:20.125 --> 32:22.208
We apologize for our delay in responding.

Tomorrow at 10 a.m., you'll be

You didn't answer my question. [sighs]

-We're staying here.

36:02.750 --> 36:03.750
It's warm in here.

36:03.833 --> 36:05.125
I'll open a window.

If you want to talk...

36:10.208 --> 36:11.458
we'll talk outside.

You're not in a position to negotiate,
my friend.

If you walk away, a recording will be
with the Egyptian press in minutes,

You want to talk?

38:12.333 --> 38:14.750
I need to offer them something
to win their trust.

38:15.333 --> 38:17.666
Well, if that's true...

38:18.833 --> 38:19.958
I want a kiss.

38:25.250 --> 38:26.375
Are you serious?

38:27.000 --> 38:27.958
Deadly.

38:28.375 --> 38:29.250
Can you blame me?

38:30.583 --> 38:33.166
Espionage. It's just so exciting.

38:35.125 --> 38:36.250
Please.

38:44.208 --> 38:45.208
[clicks]

38:50.333 --> 38:52.125
Thank you. I owe you.

38:52.750 --> 38:53.958
Damn right you do.

38:56.833 --> 38:58.083
Where are you going?

38:58.625 --> 39:00.333
-Back to the hotel.
-I'll take you.

39:01.541 --> 39:02.833
That's not a good idea.

39:08.750 --> 39:09.958
[car engine starts]

39:26.125 --> 39:27.958
-[in Hebrew] Good morning.
-Good morning.

39:30.458 --> 39:31.916
-[knocks on door]
-[man] Yes.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.875
-This is outstanding information.
-[Judah] Granted.

39:40.458 --> 39:43.000
But there's something about him
I don't trust, Zvi.

39:43.916 --> 39:47.916
But the information he provided is solid,
and that's what we're all about.

39:48.875 --> 39:50.250
The pressure is on him.

39:50.333 --> 39:52.750
He doesn't provide
verifiable intelligence,

39:52.833 --> 39:54.166
we know he isn't for real.

39:54.916 --> 39:55.833
But you're right.

39:56.166 --> 40:00.416
Why did he make the phone call?
Why come to us in the first place?

40:00.500 --> 40:03.833
It's personal. A pride issue.
He's greedy and needs the money.

40:04.291 --> 40:05.125
But, Zvi...

40:05.916 --> 40:07.541
-I know when I'm being lied to.
-[snorts]

40:07.625 --> 40:09.000
And Ashraf Marwan is not lying.

40:09.208 --> 40:10.083
Okay.

40:10.458 --> 40:13.875
[in Hebrew] If... if... Marwan is
who he says he is...

40:14.500 --> 40:17.666
letting a rookie foreign agent
handle this asset is irresponsible!

40:17.750 --> 40:20.166
[in English] Irresponsible?
You don't even trust him.

40:20.250 --> 40:22.125
We don't want to start conceding power.

40:22.250 --> 40:25.208
He wants to talk,
I can reel him in and run him properly.

40:25.291 --> 40:28.708
-No offense, I have more experience.
-We had a good first meeting.

40:28.875 --> 40:29.916
You want to blow it?

40:30.000 --> 40:33.250
We have a really big fish on the line.
You have to trust me.

40:33.333 --> 40:34.375
Gentlemen...

40:35.958 --> 40:39.500
these are stormy waters,
I don't want to rock the boat. [sniffs]

40:40.666 --> 40:43.208
-Danny will handle the asset.
-Thank you, sir.

40:43.291 --> 40:45.833
But at the first problem,
I'll remove you from the picture.

40:46.041 --> 40:46.875
As you should.

40:46.958 --> 40:49.958
I want his every move watched in London.

40:50.125 --> 40:54.125
Until we know he's genuine,
I won't take any chances.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.666
-Understood.
-Thank you.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
[man] There's Ashraf.

41:15.916 --> 41:18.083
[in Hebrew] Great, he went inside.
Go tell Danny.

41:25.666 --> 41:27.666
[glasses clinking]

41:29.166 --> 41:32.125
[indistinct chatter]

41:47.375 --> 41:50.958
-Anything to drink, sir?
-Scotch on the rocks, please.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.041
So...

41:56.833 --> 41:58.375
This is how you develop trust.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.083
I thought you'd appreciate the irony.

42:02.166 --> 42:04.333
They don't allow Arabs or Jews in here.

42:07.333 --> 42:08.708
So, what do you have for me?

42:11.416 --> 42:12.791
It's in my coat pocket.

42:14.125 --> 42:17.166
I thought we could swap tokens
and carry each other's coats.

42:19.541 --> 42:20.541
It won't work.

42:21.458 --> 42:22.291
Why?

42:24.250 --> 42:25.708
Because I like my coat.

42:26.208 --> 42:27.083
[chuckles]

42:27.208 --> 42:29.708
Listen, why don't you give me
your ticket and...

42:30.000 --> 42:31.750
hope the weather takes a warm turn?

42:36.333 --> 42:37.333
Thank you.

42:42.666 --> 42:44.875
Have your associates
come up with a proposal?

42:47.541 --> 42:50.083
I have 20,000 right here.

43:00.166 --> 43:03.750
-How does it feel?
-It's not as thick as I was expecting.

43:04.708 --> 43:06.458
The more you tell us, the thicker it gets.

43:19.083 --> 43:20.083
Thank you.

43:20.958 --> 43:22.041
Just one more thing.

43:22.666 --> 43:25.708
We need to arrange contingency
in case of emergency.

43:26.291 --> 43:28.500
When contact cannot be so...

43:30.166 --> 43:31.291
so convivial.

43:32.500 --> 43:33.916
You're talking about war?

43:36.833 --> 43:38.583
In the event of such a threat...

43:41.083 --> 43:42.333
there will be a call.

43:43.333 --> 43:47.166
-I'll talk about a delivery of chemicals.
-And if the threat is imminent?

43:52.166 --> 43:54.500
I will use the word "potassium".

43:58.125 --> 43:59.208
Does that suit?

44:03.500 --> 44:05.125
Sahetak, habibi!

44:06.833 --> 44:08.416
-Sahetak.
-[glasses clink]

44:10.958 --> 44:14.250

44:43.833 --> 44:44.708
[keys clink]

44:47.291 --> 44:48.125
[door opens]

44:48.208 --> 44:49.583
[guard] You have ten minutes.

44:53.541 --> 44:54.375
Sharaf.

44:55.291 --> 44:56.166
Babak.

45:03.083 --> 45:04.166
You look good.

45:06.041 --> 45:07.125
How are you?

45:09.541 --> 45:11.625
-Tea?
-No, thank you.

45:12.875 --> 45:13.833
Sit.

45:19.333 --> 45:20.291
[Babak clears throat]

45:26.583 --> 45:29.125
[Babak] These men in London
are loyal to me.

45:29.541 --> 45:31.541
[men speaking Egyptian]

45:35.583 --> 45:37.541
If you need more assistance,

45:38.208 --> 45:40.500
the Syrian operatives will help us.

45:41.666 --> 45:42.500
Thank you.

45:44.166 --> 45:46.541
[fan whirring]

45:53.583 --> 45:54.583
Stop here.

45:56.708 --> 45:57.583
[brakes screech]

46:02.083 --> 46:03.000
[door closes]

46:17.416 --> 46:19.500
[ominous music]

46:21.083 --> 46:24.208

46:37.208 --> 46:38.583
[train brakes squeal]

46:40.166 --> 46:42.000
[station announcement]

46:52.208 --> 46:53.583
[doors shut]

46:53.916 --> 46:55.916
[train chugs]

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
From now on...

47:02.291 --> 47:03.583
you're known as "The Angel".

47:04.583 --> 47:06.041
It's the name I got approved.

47:07.083 --> 47:08.375
"The Angel."

47:09.791 --> 47:10.750
I like it.

47:13.666 --> 47:14.583
What's this?

47:16.208 --> 47:17.916
-Happy birthday, Alex.
-[chuckles]

47:22.458 --> 47:23.708
Or do you prefer Danny?

47:28.250 --> 47:32.000
Ali Hassan Salameh. He coordinated
the attacks at the Munich Olympics.

47:32.083 --> 47:33.041
I know who he is.

47:33.416 --> 47:35.750
And we all know Israel's looking for him.

47:35.833 --> 47:37.625
-Here he is.
-Where did you get this?

47:37.708 --> 47:40.500
Same people that gave me
your real name. Verify it.

47:43.375 --> 47:47.875
-You and I, we have nothing without trust.
-Absolutely.

47:47.958 --> 47:50.000
And trust is a two-way street, Danny.

47:50.291 --> 47:51.458
Stop using that name.

47:51.541 --> 47:54.458
How can I trust you
with information like this

47:54.541 --> 47:56.875
if you won't you trust me
without a babysitter?

47:57.083 --> 47:58.291
-So, this is a test?
-No.

47:58.625 --> 47:59.541
Alex...

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
I'm betting on you.

48:02.375 --> 48:03.208
All in.

48:09.166 --> 48:10.291
[footsteps receding]

48:13.375 --> 48:15.916
[indistinct chatter]

48:24.333 --> 48:25.333
Drive.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.958
[door opens, creaks]

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
[door closes]

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Hey...

48:55.083 --> 48:56.500
[Ashraf] ''There was once...

48:58.791 --> 49:01.041
There was once a young shepherd boy...

49:06.125 --> 49:08.458
who tended his sheep...

49:09.708 --> 49:11.208
at the foot of a mountain...

49:12.666 --> 49:14.125
near a dark forest.

49:15.875 --> 49:16.708
At one time...

49:18.250 --> 49:21.875
the boy rushed down the hill
towards the village...

49:23.000 --> 49:24.500
calling...

49:25.250 --> 49:27.791
'Wolf!' 'Wolf!'

49:35.833 --> 49:38.916
Until all of the villagers
rushed out to meet him.

49:40.250 --> 49:41.958
And on the third day...

49:42.958 --> 49:44.583
the boy looked and saw...

49:46.125 --> 49:47.583
guess what?

49:49.250 --> 49:50.083
A wolf!

49:52.250 --> 49:54.458
[Ashraf] But this time,
when he cried 'Wolf!'...

49:55.958 --> 49:58.791
the villagers,
who had been fooled twice before...

49:59.708 --> 50:01.166
did not believe him

50:02.291 --> 50:04.250
and did not come to his aid.

50:05.958 --> 50:06.958
And the boy...

50:09.375 --> 50:10.541
And the boy...

50:12.791 --> 50:14.000
shouted...

50:16.541 --> 50:17.500
'Wolf!'

50:19.750 --> 50:20.666
'Wolf!'''

50:21.416 --> 50:27.208
[slow piano music playing]

50:33.416 --> 50:37.750
[clock ticking]

50:55.416 --> 50:59.791
[flag flapping]

51:03.416 --> 51:06.000
Our men will cross the Suez Canal here...

51:07.250 --> 51:08.208
and here.

51:08.916 --> 51:10.833
We created two-meter trenches

51:10.916 --> 51:13.416
to conceal our operation
from the Israeli soldiers.

51:13.875 --> 51:18.041
Inside are the anti-aircraft missiles
that arrived last month from Russia.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.333
The Israelis have no idea.

51:22.375 --> 51:24.416
How can you be sure, General Shazly?

51:26.166 --> 51:27.333
Because from the air,

51:27.500 --> 51:30.916
they look
like normal Russian anti-tank defenses.

51:31.291 --> 51:34.750
We'll attack the Israelis
with all of our mighty renewed forces.

51:35.458 --> 51:38.416
The Israeli line of defense
will not expect such an attack,

51:38.625 --> 51:40.125
nor will they be prepared for it.

51:40.708 --> 51:42.458
What will the H-Hour be?

51:43.500 --> 51:45.250
We will attack a week from today,

51:45.625 --> 51:47.666
with the sun behind us
and directly in their eyes.

51:48.375 --> 51:50.083
They won't even see us coming.

51:51.333 --> 51:53.041
Thank you, General Shazly.

51:53.333 --> 51:55.833
Let's continue this briefing
same time tomorrow morning.

51:56.625 --> 51:57.958
That will be all, gentlemen.

52:03.125 --> 52:06.166
[Ashraf] I beg you, Mr. President,
please don't do this. Not now.

52:07.791 --> 52:11.250
I've exhausted all diplomatic solutions,
Ashraf, you know that.

52:11.916 --> 52:16.250
Recovering the land taken from us
is essential if I am to remain in office.

52:17.041 --> 52:18.708
If we fail, there will be a coup.

52:20.291 --> 52:23.333
Can you imagine
how terrible a coup would be?

52:24.458 --> 52:26.875
Sometimes, peace must be fought for.

52:27.458 --> 52:29.583
[footsteps receding]

52:29.791 --> 52:33.000
[seagulls cawing]

52:33.916 --> 52:38.541
In four days, Egypt will cross
the Suez Canal into the Sinai at sunset.

52:40.125 --> 52:41.250
Are you sure?

52:42.458 --> 52:44.833
I travel back to Cairo
on Saturday morning.

52:45.208 --> 52:48.458
If there's any change,
I'll be here at 7 p.m. on Friday.

52:51.583 --> 52:52.750
And if there isn't?

52:57.000 --> 52:58.583
Then it's war, my friend.

53:13.583 --> 53:17.083
[rattling]

53:17.583 --> 53:20.791
[Danny] The Angel sent an invoice
for imminent shipment of chemicals.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.833
Urgent consideration required.

53:25.250 --> 53:27.916
Once again,
tensions are mounting in the Middle East,

53:28.250 --> 53:31.750
with an escalation of troop activity
on the Israeli-Egyptian border.

53:32.458 --> 53:36.125
Israel has placed the country
on high alert and called up the reserves.

53:36.833 --> 53:38.375
Meanwhile, across the border,

53:38.458 --> 53:42.583
Egypt's response has been to mobilize
its military on the banks of the Suez.

53:43.041 --> 53:45.833
With thousands of soldiers
from both armies amassing,

53:46.000 --> 53:49.125
the fear remains
that war could break out at any time.

53:54.666 --> 53:57.666
[indistinct chatter]

53:57.875 --> 54:00.375
[tokens clattering]

54:00.875 --> 54:01.958
[man] Deal gentlemen.

54:05.458 --> 54:07.541
[man] Raise by 1...

54:16.166 --> 54:17.416
[waiter] Here's your whiskey.

54:26.541 --> 54:27.583
[exhales]

54:31.333 --> 54:32.333

54:32.416 --> 54:33.416
[Ashraf] All in.

54:53.583 --> 54:54.666
[Mona] Ashraf...

54:59.333 --> 55:00.500
[Ashraf] Are you okay?

55:01.208 --> 55:04.000
-We have a flight to catch.
-I am very tired.

55:07.208 --> 55:08.041
[Mona exhales]

55:13.500 --> 55:14.750
You have a fever, darling.

55:26.416 --> 55:27.500
[Mona breathes heavily]

55:28.791 --> 55:30.125
Where are you going?

55:31.500 --> 55:32.583
I'll be back.

55:43.625 --> 55:44.583
[door closes]

[exhales]

56:31.875 --> 56:34.583
[mutters] Come on, Ashraf, showtime.

56:36.250 --> 56:37.125
[door opens]

56:38.458 --> 56:39.375
[door closes]

56:52.458 --> 56:53.458
[in Arabic] Take these.

56:55.375 --> 56:56.541
You'll feel better.

57:03.541 --> 57:04.541
Thank you.

57:07.708 --> 57:08.916
I love you.

57:09.291 --> 57:10.458
[Zvi] I'll report.

57:12.375 --> 57:14.375
[TV playing]

57:17.750 --> 57:18.750
[Zvi] That was Golda.

57:21.083 --> 57:24.791
She wanted to remind us
of the gravity of the situation.

57:26.833 --> 57:30.125
We are talking about tens
of thousands of men mobilized

57:30.208 --> 57:31.708
on information from our source.

57:31.875 --> 57:34.750
-Sir--
-[Zvi] Not to mention the 8% reserves.

57:35.125 --> 57:38.458
Shopkeepers, lawyers and doctors
that cost the Israeli economy

57:38.541 --> 57:40.625
millions of dollars at every false alarm.

57:40.791 --> 57:42.916
Sir, you didn't see him. He was certain.

57:43.041 --> 57:44.541
Maybe it's an internal problem.

57:44.708 --> 57:46.250
[Danny] Maybe Sadat got cold feet.

57:46.333 --> 57:49.791
You need to learn to handle your asset
before he becomes a liability.

57:50.708 --> 57:52.875
Sir, he has always given us incredible--

57:52.958 --> 57:53.958
Enough!

57:55.875 --> 57:58.166
A good agent is only ever in the moment.

57:58.750 --> 58:02.041
If you have stars in your eyes,
you are of no use to me, clear?

58:03.708 --> 58:04.583
Yes, sir.

58:06.375 --> 58:07.291
[door bangs]

58:10.041 --> 58:11.291
[in Arabic] Good morning.

58:12.541 --> 58:13.666
Good morning.

58:14.541 --> 58:15.750
These are for the safe.

58:16.583 --> 58:18.208
Are you good, Ashraf?

58:18.916 --> 58:21.041
[Sadat]
I haven't seen you around lately...

58:23.666 --> 58:26.708
You look like
you haven't slept in a decade.

58:28.041 --> 58:29.666
I'm fine, Mr. President.

58:29.875 --> 58:32.666
Good, I have a matter of my own
to discuss with you.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.250
-In private, please.
-Excuse me, sir.

58:39.083 --> 58:43.833
Since you are very well acquainted
with high-ranking diplomats in Libya...

58:45.000 --> 58:47.541
I want you to meet with Colonel Gaddafi.

58:48.375 --> 58:49.375
Gaddafi is unstable,

58:50.416 --> 58:53.083
but you're good
at managing unstable personalities.

58:54.375 --> 58:58.000
Charm and convince him
to let us tap his oil reserves.

58:59.833 --> 59:01.958
What does one offer
to charm a man like that?

59:02.041 --> 59:03.500
I'm sure you can find something.

59:04.541 --> 59:06.416
Bring this home for us,

59:06.500 --> 59:09.708
and I'll make you
Liaison for Special Affairs.

59:11.166 --> 59:14.875
You will act as my personal emissary
to all the leaders of the Arab World.

59:17.250 --> 59:19.875
How does that sound, Ashraf?

59:21.708 --> 59:23.916
Like a great plan, Mr. President.

59:24.166 --> 59:26.333
[Sadat laughs]

-[lively Arabic music playing]
-[people chattering and laughing]

59:59.958 --> 1:00:02.083
[in Arabic]
It's amazing what you've built.

1:00:03.166 --> 1:00:05.083
For the son of a Bedouin goat herder?

1:00:05.458 --> 1:00:06.666
[chuckles]

1:00:06.791 --> 1:00:07.791
I intended no offense.

1:00:08.750 --> 1:00:10.458
And none was taken.

1:00:11.791 --> 1:00:12.750
Ashraf...

1:00:12.958 --> 1:00:14.125
This will surprise you...

1:00:14.208 --> 1:00:15.583
I'm writing a book.

1:00:15.666 --> 1:00:16.791
The Green Book.

1:00:17.708 --> 1:00:18.583
The Green Book?

1:00:18.666 --> 1:00:21.791
It is a guide to the emancipation
of men, a new gospel.

1:00:22.541 --> 1:00:24.250
The Western Bible states:

1:00:24.333 --> 1:00:27.500
"In the beginning was the Word
and the Word was God."

1:00:28.250 --> 1:00:31.500
The Green Book will be
the new word for a new era.

1:00:31.583 --> 1:00:32.750
My word.

1:00:33.541 --> 1:00:34.833
It will help you govern?

1:00:36.208 --> 1:00:37.916
Along with power and fear.

1:00:38.541 --> 1:00:39.750
Without those,

1:00:39.833 --> 1:00:42.875
the Arab people will go to the streets
and destroy themselves.

1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:44.208
You mark my words.

1:00:44.916 --> 1:00:47.333
Civil war will rage
across the Middle East,

1:00:47.541 --> 1:00:49.458
chaos and destruction will reign.

1:00:50.708 --> 1:00:51.833
I'm a realist.

1:00:52.541 --> 1:00:54.458
My enemies are not going anywhere.

1:00:54.750 --> 1:00:56.875
There will always be a threat to my life.

1:00:58.750 --> 1:01:01.583
You speak of enemies?
Perhaps I can help with that.

1:01:05.208 --> 1:01:06.083
[suitcase clicks]

1:01:10.250 --> 1:01:11.583
[Ashraf] A gesture, from a friend.

1:01:19.166 --> 1:01:20.000
[Gaddafi chuckles]

1:01:20.333 --> 1:01:21.750
You see?

1:01:22.708 --> 1:01:23.833
Divine intervention!

1:01:25.625 --> 1:01:28.083
You can tell Sadat I agree to his request.

1:01:29.916 --> 1:01:30.750
But...

1:01:31.041 --> 1:01:34.000
if he makes a deal
with the American devil and the Zionists,

1:01:34.458 --> 1:01:36.208
I will charge him double on the oil.

1:01:37.625 --> 1:01:38.916
Only double?

1:01:40.250 --> 1:01:41.375
[chuckles]

1:01:41.708 --> 1:01:43.833
You are right, triple!

1:01:44.125 --> 1:01:45.250
[laughs]

1:01:45.833 --> 1:01:48.083
I think it's time
for me to leave, Colonel.

1:01:48.166 --> 1:01:49.166
[Gaddafi] Nonsense!

1:01:50.083 --> 1:01:51.833
We must break bread together.

1:01:52.375 --> 1:01:54.958
And you must spend some time
with our Libyan girls.

1:01:56.708 --> 1:01:57.958
What do you think?

1:01:59.416 --> 1:02:02.125
I appreciate that, I really do...

1:02:02.708 --> 1:02:04.708
but I'm a married man.

1:02:05.250 --> 1:02:07.541
All the more reason why you deserve it.

1:02:09.333 --> 1:02:12.125
You are a good man, a loyal man.

1:02:12.916 --> 1:02:15.000
But if you don't want
to taste the goat's milk,

1:02:15.708 --> 1:02:18.416
the least you can do is stay

1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:20.375
and watch the farmer in action.

1:02:21.708 --> 1:02:22.666
I insist.

1:02:26.166 --> 1:02:27.083

1:02:44.791 --> 1:02:48.458
-I have something for you and Gamal.
-[Mona shushing]

1:02:48.750 --> 1:02:50.416
Quiet, Gamal is sleeping.

1:02:54.625 --> 1:02:58.833
[sings] I love you, Mona.

1:02:59.583 --> 1:03:00.416
[thuds]

1:03:00.583 --> 1:03:01.666
Thank you.

1:03:05.083 --> 1:03:06.125
What's wrong?

1:03:07.041 --> 1:03:08.416
Where were you, today?

1:03:09.041 --> 1:03:12.333
You flew in early.
Your office said you were unreachable.

1:03:13.208 --> 1:03:14.333
I had a meeting.

1:03:15.416 --> 1:03:16.583
With Diana Ellis?

1:03:18.416 --> 1:03:19.375
[sighs]

1:03:19.958 --> 1:03:20.791
What?

1:03:21.166 --> 1:03:23.625
If I were a man,
I'd be happy to have her as a mistress.

1:03:24.208 --> 1:03:26.416
She's no threat to you or to us.

1:03:27.208 --> 1:03:28.041
Then who is?

1:03:28.708 --> 1:03:30.000
No one is.

1:03:30.083 --> 1:03:32.458
You are always disappearing
at odd moments.

1:03:32.875 --> 1:03:35.166
Emergency trips to Rome or Paris.

1:03:35.833 --> 1:03:37.458
Do you think I'm blind, Ashraf?

1:03:38.166 --> 1:03:39.083
Stupid?

1:03:39.708 --> 1:03:41.791
-No.
-Well, I am.

1:03:42.208 --> 1:03:43.708
-I must be.
-Mona...

1:03:47.458 --> 1:03:50.833
There is no other woman,
there never has been and never will be.

1:03:50.916 --> 1:03:53.458
Please let's not do this. Please.

1:03:54.458 --> 1:03:56.583
Then what aren't you telling me?

1:03:57.500 --> 1:04:00.583
It's a matter of state security.
I'm sorry, I can't say more.

1:04:01.166 --> 1:04:02.208
Please.

1:04:02.291 --> 1:04:06.125
[in Arabic] The life you have now,
that was your wish, Ashraf, not mine.

1:04:06.833 --> 1:04:08.750
-[Ashraf shushing]
-I'm a strong woman, Ashraf,

1:04:09.416 --> 1:04:10.666
but I have my limits.

1:04:14.625 --> 1:04:18.458
I picked him up
as he left the Israeli Embassy.

1:04:19.208 --> 1:04:20.125
He's known as Alex.

1:04:22.916 --> 1:04:23.833
Maybe...

1:04:25.666 --> 1:04:27.333
he is a simple clerk.

1:04:28.583 --> 1:04:29.875
No, he's Mossad.

1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.625
He was waiting for Ashraf, I know it.

1:04:43.416 --> 1:04:45.458
The son-in-law of the great Nasser...

1:04:47.708 --> 1:04:49.791
working for the Israelis?

1:04:53.500 --> 1:04:56.583
That's a wild assumption, Babak.

1:04:58.416 --> 1:05:00.625
We need proof of this.

1:05:00.750 --> 1:05:02.541
[Babak sighs]

1:05:05.708 --> 1:05:08.541
[Babak] I have your men watching
every move he makes.

1:05:15.833 --> 1:05:17.333
Where is Ashraf now?

1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:20.125
He is back in London.

1:05:21.833 --> 1:05:23.000

Trust? You are fucking kidding me.

You played us, you know you did.
I didn't see it, that's on me.

1:07:57.208 --> 1:08:00.666
This is what you were doing
when you first called the Israeli Embassy.

1:08:00.750 --> 1:08:03.833
-Is this your goal? To fuck with Israel?
-No...

1:08:04.875 --> 1:08:06.833
Then why? Why do you do it?

1:08:10.208 --> 1:08:11.958
You want another war, Alex?

1:08:13.125 --> 1:08:14.083
Huh?

1:08:15.291 --> 1:08:16.291
Tell me.

1:08:17.708 --> 1:08:18.708
Because I don't.

1:08:31.041 --> 1:08:34.250
Everything I told you,
I told you in good faith.

1:08:35.458 --> 1:08:37.416
Getting moral on me? That's not like you.

1:08:38.166 --> 1:08:39.166
Give me that.

1:08:40.458 --> 1:08:42.875
Why, because I sold out
my country for money?

1:08:44.166 --> 1:08:45.958
No, because you're a fucking liar.

1:08:54.250 --> 1:08:55.208
[Danny] What is this?

1:08:55.708 --> 1:08:59.125

for Egypt's invasion into the Sinai.

-[shouts] Again, Ashraf!
-Alex, please.

1:09:03.291 --> 1:09:06.250
I was given these plans
by General Shazly himself,

I don't understand
why you changed your mind.

1:09:23.875 --> 1:09:27.583
General, my mind has not changed,
it's simply not the right timing.

1:09:28.625 --> 1:09:33.625
-I had a gut feeling that we should wait.
-Why, Mr. President? The army is ready.

1:09:33.833 --> 1:09:35.708
We should move forward
with the original plan.

1:09:36.166 --> 1:09:37.791
That'll be all, General.

1:09:41.125 --> 1:09:44.125

Israel has increased
the readiness of its reserve army.

1:10:19.916 --> 1:10:23.291
The act of aggression was condemned
by the United Arab League

Apologies for interrupting
but there is something urgent.

1:11:28.791 --> 1:11:30.625
-Go on.
-[man] Someone called twice.

1:11:30.916 --> 1:11:32.250
Asking for you, Mr. Marwan.

1:11:34.416 --> 1:11:35.250
Who was it?

1:11:35.333 --> 1:11:38.541
He didn't say. Something
about chemicals that weren't delivered.

1:11:41.916 --> 1:11:43.000
What exactly did he say?

1:11:43.416 --> 1:11:46.708
That it was imperative you contact him
but didn't leave a number.

1:11:49.041 --> 1:11:52.125
I have no idea what that's about.
Thank you.

1:11:52.208 --> 1:11:53.208
Excuse me, sir.

1:11:58.166 --> 1:12:01.208
What business do you have
with the delivery of chemicals?

1:12:01.500 --> 1:12:04.375
I don't know, Your Excellency.
Maybe they have the wrong number.

1:12:08.625 --> 1:12:09.541
[Sadat] Fine.

1:12:12.458 --> 1:12:14.541
-OK, here you go.
-Thank you, Mr. President.

1:12:27.250 --> 1:12:29.625
[airplane flying overhead]

1:12:45.708 --> 1:12:46.875
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

1:12:48.875 --> 1:12:49.958
From Alex.

1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:27.416
[elevator bell dings]

1:13:30.458 --> 1:13:31.583
Thank you.

1:13:36.875 --> 1:13:38.041
[clicks]

1:13:44.625 --> 1:13:48.333

1:14:18.041 --> 1:14:19.000
[car door opens]

1:14:20.041 --> 1:14:20.916
[door closes]

1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.625
Mr. Marwan, we need a moment of your time.

1:14:25.375 --> 1:14:28.083
-What for?
-In the car, please.

1:14:30.125 --> 1:14:31.041
Let's go.

1:14:33.791 --> 1:14:34.791
-[bangs]
-[man grunts]

1:14:36.916 --> 1:14:39.250
[engine revving]

1:14:41.666 --> 1:14:43.333
[tires squealing]

1:14:46.958 --> 1:14:48.291
[both groan]

1:14:48.458 --> 1:14:50.000
-[brakes screech]
-[door opens]

1:14:50.875 --> 1:14:53.541
[Ashraf breathing heavily]

1:14:53.833 --> 1:14:55.208
[Ashraf] Please! Please!

1:14:57.166 --> 1:14:58.083
[door closes]

1:15:01.166 --> 1:15:03.416
-[in Hebrew] Tell Judah we are coming.
-OK, Gideon.

1:15:03.625 --> 1:15:05.208
-[door closes]
-Start. Start. Start.

1:15:36.708 --> 1:15:38.583
-[in Hebrew] Where is he?
-In the trunk.

1:15:43.416 --> 1:15:44.375
[coughs]

1:15:45.041 --> 1:15:45.875
[gags]

1:15:46.375 --> 1:15:48.333
[in Arabic] Good morning, father of Gamal.

1:15:50.791 --> 1:15:51.791
Take him out.

1:15:51.875 --> 1:15:52.875
Get out.

1:15:54.791 --> 1:15:56.791
[birds chirping]

1:15:59.750 --> 1:16:00.625
[Ashraf retches]

1:16:01.083 --> 1:16:02.083
Where am I?

1:16:03.291 --> 1:16:04.166
[breathing heavily]

1:16:04.291 --> 1:16:05.333
You remember me?

1:16:07.750 --> 1:16:08.916
Yes, I remember you.

1:16:18.666 --> 1:16:19.750
What do you want?

1:16:24.375 --> 1:16:26.583
Let's start again. Call me Elliot.

1:16:29.208 --> 1:16:30.291
Where is Alex? [grunts]

1:16:31.250 --> 1:16:32.458
[Judah] Forget about Alex.

1:16:32.916 --> 1:16:36.666
We've paid you well for information
that has twice turned out to be false.

1:16:36.750 --> 1:16:39.916
We wasted a lot of energy
and money acting on that information.

1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:42.583
The attack plans were not false.

1:16:43.333 --> 1:16:45.791
I can't help it
that Sadat keeps changing his mind.

1:16:45.875 --> 1:16:48.958
The man is unpredictable.
Do you understand that?

1:16:56.208 --> 1:16:57.958
You have a beautiful family, Ashraf.

1:17:01.291 --> 1:17:03.291
They must be a great comfort to you.

1:17:08.041 --> 1:17:10.041
Where is Alex? Does he know about this?

1:17:10.291 --> 1:17:12.083
No one can protect you if you lie to us.

1:17:13.750 --> 1:17:14.791
What do you want?

1:17:14.958 --> 1:17:18.375
Is Egypt going to launch
a war against Israel?

1:17:18.958 --> 1:17:23.000
Of course, there's going to be a war.
Of course, Sadat is going to attack.

1:17:23.083 --> 1:17:24.958
He's backed in a corner!

1:17:26.916 --> 1:17:30.458
He kicks out the Soviets
and the US backs out of the deal,

1:17:30.541 --> 1:17:33.500
he's left with no choice except war!
[gun cocks]

1:17:33.583 --> 1:17:34.791
You want...

1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:46.666
You want to save Israel?

1:17:48.500 --> 1:17:49.500
Huh?

1:17:49.875 --> 1:17:52.416
You want to save the lives
of your soldiers?

1:17:54.166 --> 1:17:57.625
Enter into talks to give back the Sinai!

1:18:04.875 --> 1:18:06.000
You want to shoot?

1:18:08.583 --> 1:18:09.500
Shoot.

1:18:09.958 --> 1:18:10.916
[cocks]

1:18:12.041 --> 1:18:13.041
Shoot.

1:18:15.291 --> 1:18:16.166
[Ashraf laughs]

1:18:16.291 --> 1:18:17.416
I don't care, shoot.

1:18:17.666 --> 1:18:18.666
Shoot.

1:18:22.541 --> 1:18:23.541
[in Hebrew] Leave him.

1:18:24.500 --> 1:18:26.916
-[breathes heavily]
-[Judah] Let him get back alone.

1:18:28.250 --> 1:18:29.250
[door opens]

1:18:33.625 --> 1:18:34.541

1:18:37.250 --> 1:18:38.125
[engine starts]

1:18:58.041 --> 1:18:59.166
Come to Mommy.

1:19:03.875 --> 1:19:05.291
-[screams]
-Don't make a sound!

1:19:05.375 --> 1:19:07.375
-Take the kid away.
-[Mona] Gamal!

1:19:07.500 --> 1:19:09.416
-Gamal! Gamal!
-Mama, mama!

1:19:09.916 --> 1:19:12.500
-[sensor beeping]
-[Mona whimpering]

1:19:14.666 --> 1:19:15.500
[man] Sit.

1:19:15.833 --> 1:19:16.708
[crying]

1:19:16.875 --> 1:19:19.000
-Did you find anything?
-Nothing.

1:19:19.083 --> 1:19:20.750
-You searched well?
-Yes.

1:19:22.083 --> 1:19:23.583
[breathing heavily]

1:19:23.666 --> 1:19:25.041
Where is the safe?

1:19:26.083 --> 1:19:27.541
We don't have a safe.

1:19:28.083 --> 1:19:29.750
We don't have a lot of time to waste.

1:19:29.916 --> 1:19:32.000
I asked where is the safe?

1:19:32.208 --> 1:19:34.375
I said we don't have a safe.

1:19:34.458 --> 1:19:36.291
[shouts] Where is the safe?

1:19:36.500 --> 1:19:38.250
I swear to you! We don't have a safe.

1:19:38.666 --> 1:19:40.750
You'll talk! I will make you talk.

1:19:42.666 --> 1:19:45.791
-Where is my son?
-Sit down. Your son is fine. Sit down!

1:19:45.875 --> 1:19:47.250
I said sit down!

1:19:47.333 --> 1:19:48.375
[shouts] Sit down!

1:19:49.666 --> 1:19:51.875
[sobbing]

1:19:52.208 --> 1:19:53.208
Listen.

1:19:55.166 --> 1:19:58.000
If you report what happened here...

1:19:59.625 --> 1:20:03.041
we will be back,
and we will kill you, one by one.

1:20:04.375 --> 1:20:06.416
One by one.

1:20:07.458 --> 1:20:08.583
Count to 100.

1:20:10.916 --> 1:20:11.875
Count.

1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:14.000
[shouts] Count!

1:20:15.083 --> 1:20:16.166
One...

1:20:17.333 --> 1:20:18.333

Mrs. Mona...

1:20:40.416 --> 1:20:42.375
-Mom!
-My love...

1:20:43.666 --> 1:20:44.958
Don't be afraid.

1:20:47.750 --> 1:20:48.750
I'm sorry...

1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:50.291
[phone ringing]

1:20:50.916 --> 1:20:51.833
Hello?

1:20:52.041 --> 1:20:54.166
[Mona speaks indistinctly]

1:20:54.375 --> 1:20:55.375
Mona?

1:20:56.708 --> 1:20:58.500
Mona, Mona, Mona, hey...

1:21:01.500 --> 1:21:02.750
[squeaks]

1:21:06.958 --> 1:21:08.333
-Smile to me.
-[girl laughs]

1:21:08.416 --> 1:21:10.291
-Danny, smile!
-I'm smiling.

1:21:10.416 --> 1:21:12.375
Are you laughing at me angel?

1:21:13.500 --> 1:21:15.041
[indistinct chatter]

1:21:18.750 --> 1:21:19.583
She's beautiful.

1:21:21.291 --> 1:21:22.416
-Thank you.
-[Danny] Hey!

1:21:22.791 --> 1:21:24.500
-Hey.
-What are you doing here?

1:21:24.583 --> 1:21:26.500
-[woman] Who is it, honey?
-An old friend.

1:21:27.416 --> 1:21:28.458
Ashraf.

1:21:29.291 --> 1:21:31.583
-She must be a great comfort to you.
-She is.

1:21:31.666 --> 1:21:33.041
-Nice to meet you.
-And you.

1:21:33.125 --> 1:21:34.250
-Bye, sweetheart.
-Ashraf!

1:21:34.333 --> 1:21:35.833
-Bye-bye.
-[girl] Bye-bye.

1:21:39.583 --> 1:21:41.916
-What are you doing here?
-I was threatened.

1:21:42.250 --> 1:21:43.083
Where were you?

1:21:45.333 --> 1:21:48.416
Never ever approach me
when I'm with my family.

1:21:48.583 --> 1:21:50.333
Oh, but my family is fair game?

1:21:52.333 --> 1:21:54.458
You think Mossad is one big happy family?

1:21:55.291 --> 1:21:58.875
There are factions within factions,
and they all have their own opinion.

1:21:59.333 --> 1:22:00.750
I can't control you, Ashraf.

1:22:00.875 --> 1:22:03.875
I can't control your lies
or their outcome, so I'm out.

1:22:04.916 --> 1:22:06.125
You fucked up, Ashraf.

1:22:06.416 --> 1:22:09.375
You fuck up. I can't protect you
from people who get mad at you.

1:22:09.708 --> 1:22:12.166
-You can speak to them.
-It doesn't work that way.

1:22:12.375 --> 1:22:15.375
You have to do something bigger
to win back their trust.

1:22:15.708 --> 1:22:17.916
Their trust? Or yours?

1:22:18.458 --> 1:22:19.583
It's all the same.

1:22:20.208 --> 1:22:21.333
It's good to see you.

1:22:38.125 --> 1:22:39.000
[door opens]

1:22:46.791 --> 1:22:49.166
[in Arabic] Gamal, take care
of your mother for me.

1:22:49.291 --> 1:22:50.375
OK, my love?

1:22:57.750 --> 1:22:58.583
[door closes]

1:22:59.541 --> 1:23:01.375
Are you sure you will be safe?

1:23:02.875 --> 1:23:06.791
I'll be okay, but I can't protect you two
from my enemies when I'm not at home.

1:23:07.833 --> 1:23:10.333
Talk to me, Ashraf. Who are these enemies?

1:23:10.750 --> 1:23:12.791
You will be safe
with people I trust in Geneva.

1:23:13.250 --> 1:23:15.166
-That's not a clear answer.
-Listen.

1:23:16.041 --> 1:23:17.083
Listen to me.

1:23:17.250 --> 1:23:19.083
In a day or two, this will all blow over.

1:23:19.583 --> 1:23:20.791
I give you my word.

1:23:21.875 --> 1:23:22.750
I promise you.

1:23:24.625 --> 1:23:26.125
Come on, you'll miss your flight.

1:23:28.041 --> 1:23:29.958
It will all be fine. Trust me.

1:23:58.125 --> 1:24:00.291
-Bye-bye, my love.
-Bye-bye.

1:24:03.083 --> 1:24:04.791
[engine starts]

1:24:15.875 --> 1:24:19.750
We didn't find anything in his house.
He sent his family to Switzerland.

1:24:23.166 --> 1:24:26.500
I want to know every move he makes.

1:24:27.416 --> 1:24:29.750
I know he's onto something.

1:24:30.291 --> 1:24:34.416
We only need him to make one mistake.

1:24:39.541 --> 1:24:40.541
Yes.

1:24:41.125 --> 1:24:45.291
[news reader] Libyan Arab Airlines
Flight 114 was en route to Cairo

1:24:45.375 --> 1:24:48.708
when it's believed to have entered
a sand storm over the Sinai Peninsula.

1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:52.375
Against a backdrop of escalating
tensions in the Middle East,

1:24:52.458 --> 1:24:53.916
Israeli fighter jets are thought

1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:57.291
to have mistakenly shot down
the Libyan commercial aircraft,

1:24:57.375 --> 1:25:00.458
which was carrying
113 passengers and crew,

1:25:00.541 --> 1:25:02.083
just five of whom have survived.

1:25:02.166 --> 1:25:05.416
It's been shot by military aircraft.

1:25:07.166 --> 1:25:11.500
Therefore, it is to be taken
as a premeditated mass murder.

1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:16.250
[in Arabic] The Israeli Foreign Minister
has expressed regret over the incident,

1:25:16.458 --> 1:25:19.833
while on the Arab streets
there have been mass protests

1:25:19.916 --> 1:25:21.750
against the Zionist aggressor.

1:25:23.250 --> 1:25:24.916
Retaliation is needed!

1:25:25.958 --> 1:25:28.000
A life for a life!

1:25:28.541 --> 1:25:29.875
An eye for an eye!

1:25:31.375 --> 1:25:32.791
I am Gaddafi!

1:25:33.541 --> 1:25:35.500
Nobody messes with us!

1:25:36.375 --> 1:25:38.291
[man] Palestinian Black September fighters

1:25:38.375 --> 1:25:40.625
will carry out Gaddafi's revenge attack
in Rome.

1:25:40.708 --> 1:25:44.333
If you give Gaddafi your back,
Arab unity will fall apart.

1:25:46.083 --> 1:25:47.041
So be it.

1:25:48.083 --> 1:25:51.208
I won't write my name on a missile
that will kill innocent civilians.

1:25:51.500 --> 1:25:56.166
The Israelis made a tragic mistake.
Our action would be premeditated murder.

1:25:56.625 --> 1:25:58.541
That will not be our legacy.

1:26:01.583 --> 1:26:03.166
Let me meet with Gaddafi.

1:26:03.500 --> 1:26:04.416
To what end?

1:26:05.625 --> 1:26:07.208
Ashraf, the man is a rabid dog.

1:26:07.791 --> 1:26:10.000
You won't be able
to talk him out of revenge.

1:26:12.250 --> 1:26:13.500
I don't want to.

1:26:14.833 --> 1:26:17.375
We give Gaddafi exactly what he wants;

1:26:18.291 --> 1:26:20.708
your implicit support
of an attack against Israel.

-Ashraf. Is that really you?
-I know it's out of the blue.

1:27:46.750 --> 1:27:48.500
-How are you?
-I'm all right.

1:27:49.125 --> 1:27:50.500
It's been a while.

1:27:51.833 --> 1:27:53.791
Yes, I'm sorry I disappeared.

1:27:54.333 --> 1:27:57.916
-Don't worry, I managed.
-Darling, I have a favor to ask.

1:27:58.083 --> 1:27:59.000
Really?

1:27:59.333 --> 1:28:00.166
Yes.

Tell me more.

I hope you appreciate
I saved that plane in Rome.

1:28:21.416 --> 1:28:23.416
There were 120 souls on it.

1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:27.000
-What do you want?
-I don't have much time so listen.

1:28:27.541 --> 1:28:31.416
There's a shipment of waste,
potassium waste, you hear me?

1:28:31.541 --> 1:28:32.708
Lots of potassium.

1:28:34.666 --> 1:28:37.708
-Potassium?
-Yes. I will need the manager himself.

1:28:38.708 --> 1:28:42.500
It's time we spoke face to face.
Now, I will be in London tomorrow.

1:28:42.583 --> 1:28:45.916
-Can you swing it?
-Okay, yes, but where are you now?

1:28:46.416 --> 1:28:47.583

We can't listen to this man,
he's not living in the real world.

1:29:12.708 --> 1:29:15.250
He wants to meet you,
give you the news in person.

1:29:15.666 --> 1:29:16.750
Where is he?

1:29:16.833 --> 1:29:19.000
With Arabic in the background,
I guess it's Cairo.

1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:21.416
He said the word "potassium".

1:29:22.333 --> 1:29:23.250
Potassium?

1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:25.666
Yeah, he never used that before.

1:29:26.083 --> 1:29:26.916
[sighs]

1:29:27.250 --> 1:29:29.416
What he did in Rome was suicidal for him.

1:29:29.875 --> 1:29:32.333
He saved a lot of Israelis on that plane.

1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:34.833
[sighs]

1:29:35.708 --> 1:29:36.708
I don't know.

1:29:38.083 --> 1:29:39.250
What if he's right?

1:29:40.083 --> 1:29:41.000
What if he's right?

1:29:41.916 --> 1:29:44.625
Then we knew
about an imminent attack and did nothing.

1:29:45.500 --> 1:29:46.625
And on Yom Kippur.

1:29:52.083 --> 1:29:53.291
What do you want to do?

1:29:54.125 --> 1:29:56.458
Cut him loose or get you to London?

1:30:00.916 --> 1:30:01.916
Ashraf!

1:30:02.583 --> 1:30:04.333
Ashraf! Darling!

-So good to see you!
-Let me look at you.

1:30:07.375 --> 1:30:10.875
-You look absolutely wonderful.
-So do you. Come on, darling.

Don't be shy. Show me your acting skills.

She could be a cover for him.

Don't lose him.

you need to go all the way.

I've been on the phone with Cairo,
trying to get the latest information.

1:32:56.083 --> 1:33:00.000
-I apologize for being late.
-It's okay, I just got in myself.

Sadat intends to go to war tomorrow
with the cooperation of the Syrians.

1:33:24.041 --> 1:33:25.958
Who did you get this information from?

1:33:26.541 --> 1:33:29.083
General Shazly, and Sadat himself.

1:33:29.625 --> 1:33:30.750
When will it be?

1:33:31.833 --> 1:33:34.291
I didn't know until last night
that it's set for tomorrow.

1:33:34.375 --> 1:33:36.416

1:33:36.500 --> 1:33:38.500

1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:43.333
They will attack,
tomorrow evening at six o'clock...

1:33:43.833 --> 1:33:46.916
to take advantage of the sun
in the Israeli soldiers' eyes.

1:33:51.583 --> 1:33:53.583
That's 18 hours away from now.

1:33:53.875 --> 1:33:56.250
The Egyptian war plan calls
for passenger jets

1:33:56.333 --> 1:33:58.250
to be re-routed to friendly states.

1:33:58.708 --> 1:34:02.208
You can verify it with Egypt Air,
but I suggest you do it quickly.

1:34:02.833 --> 1:34:04.916
Russians came through
with anti-aircraft missiles.

1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:07.125
This... is happening, General.

1:34:14.625 --> 1:34:17.708
[Zvi] You told us war was coming
on two other occasions...

1:34:18.416 --> 1:34:20.000
both of them false,

1:34:20.250 --> 1:34:23.916
so why don't you tell me
why I should believe you this time.

1:34:25.500 --> 1:34:26.916
Because if you don't...

1:34:28.500 --> 1:34:32.500
too many innocent people
will die on both sides, that's why!

1:34:44.208 --> 1:34:45.291
Excuse us.

1:34:45.833 --> 1:34:47.666
Sit in the other room, Ashraf.

1:34:57.625 --> 1:34:58.708

1:34:59.125 --> 1:35:01.958
[in Hebrew] If that man is lying,
he's the best liar I've ever seen.

1:35:06.625 --> 1:35:07.625
Call it, Zvi.

1:35:11.791 --> 1:35:16.750
You understand, that if I send a warning
back to Jerusalem of immediate war

1:35:16.833 --> 1:35:19.333
on Yom Kippur, no less,
and war never comes...

1:35:22.250 --> 1:35:25.375
this will be the end of more
than just our relationship.

1:35:30.375 --> 1:35:31.500
I understand, sir.

1:35:35.916 --> 1:35:36.916
You can go.

1:35:40.958 --> 1:35:41.958
[Danny] Ashraf!

1:35:47.041 --> 1:35:48.041

1:36:14.083 --> 1:36:16.125
Another false alarm or a war?

1:36:17.375 --> 1:36:19.000
I really believe him, Zvi.

1:36:25.291 --> 1:36:27.208
I'll send a telegram to Jerusalem.

1:36:31.208 --> 1:36:32.333

1:36:32.791 --> 1:36:37.416
[Zvi] The company will sign the contract
today October 6th at 18:00 hours.

1:36:37.791 --> 1:36:41.041
The meeting with The Angel
convinced me to send this message.

1:36:41.291 --> 1:36:44.250
It is my sincere belief
he is speaking the truth.

1:36:44.916 --> 1:36:45.958
Act accordingly.

1:37:01.958 --> 1:37:03.000
[Ashraf] Mona...

1:37:03.083 --> 1:37:04.291
[in Arabic] I love you.

1:37:04.375 --> 1:37:05.375
Believe that.

1:37:05.916 --> 1:37:08.791
-This is all in your head.
-No! It's not.

1:37:08.916 --> 1:37:10.958
You promised you'd never lie to me.

1:37:11.833 --> 1:37:12.750
I beg you.

1:37:12.916 --> 1:37:16.083
This life you think is so fulfilling,
leave it behind, come back to us.

1:37:16.166 --> 1:37:19.458

Just come with me, my love.

1:37:35.708 --> 1:37:36.791
[bangs]

1:37:38.833 --> 1:37:42.000
[General] What we need is to practice
war games out in the open.

1:37:43.166 --> 1:37:45.250
Make it look like we are going to invade.

1:37:46.708 --> 1:37:49.666
Please don't do this,
Mr. President. Not now.

1:37:56.916 --> 1:38:00.708
Your only chance for a peace agreement
comes if Israel loses the war.

1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:04.791
Not defeated entirely, but hurt.

1:38:05.833 --> 1:38:09.208
And victory over Israel can
only be achieved with a surprise attack.

1:38:09.708 --> 1:38:11.708
Which is impossible to achieve.

1:38:13.541 --> 1:38:15.958
The Boy Who Cried Wolf.

1:38:17.250 --> 1:38:19.125

1:38:20.541 --> 1:38:21.583
Go on...

1:38:22.750 --> 1:38:26.208
Our army needs to prepare
for an attack in front of the Israelis...

1:38:27.750 --> 1:38:29.208
and then do nothing.

1:38:30.125 --> 1:38:32.791
A month later, more war games.

1:38:33.833 --> 1:38:36.166
Soon, your opponent will grow tired
of looking so closely.

1:38:37.166 --> 1:38:38.708
You have a major advantage.

1:38:39.833 --> 1:38:43.750
The Israelis believe
you can never defeat them in war.

1:38:44.625 --> 1:38:49.708
Bait them, fool them and let them think
they know what you are up to.

1:38:51.208 --> 1:38:52.375
A bluff...

1:38:52.916 --> 1:38:54.000
and another bluff.

1:38:57.416 --> 1:39:00.750
[Ashraf] And when they're lulled
into thinking you're all bluster...

1:39:01.791 --> 1:39:03.916
and you have no cards left to play...

1:39:05.541 --> 1:39:06.833
then you go all in.

1:39:07.791 --> 1:39:09.291
And when will that be?

The Israeli Army reported
that shortly before 2 p.m.

Syrian and Egyptian armies

[Ashraf] We need to weaken Israel,
not destroy it.

This way, we can force Israel
into negotiation,

1:39:55.416 --> 1:39:57.500
and stop the heavy bloodshed.

1:40:00.958 --> 1:40:03.541
So, we start a war on their holy day?

1:40:48.458 --> 1:40:50.833
There is no clear winner
in this bloody conflict

1:40:50.916 --> 1:40:53.250
that has claimed 17,000 lives.

1:40:54.333 --> 1:40:56.000
But what remains a certainty

1:40:56.125 --> 1:40:58.250
is that in a war
in which there are only losers...

1:40:58.333 --> 1:40:59.208
[gunshot]

1:41:00.708 --> 1:41:03.000
...lasting peace is the only victory.

1:41:03.500 --> 1:41:05.583
-[loading riffles]

1:41:11.541 --> 1:41:14.500
[clapping]

1:41:14.625 --> 1:41:18.333
[man] I have come to Jerusalem,
the city of peace...

1:41:19.791 --> 1:41:23.625
which will always remain
as a living embodiment

1:41:23.708 --> 1:41:28.916
of coexistence among believers
of the three religions.

1:41:31.291 --> 1:41:34.041
When the bells of peace ring...

1:41:34.833 --> 1:41:39.166
there will be no hands
to beat the drums of war.

1:41:39.708 --> 1:41:44.291
Even if they existed, they would be still.

1:41:45.416 --> 1:41:49.750
I pledge myself
with true and sincere words...

1:41:49.833 --> 1:41:52.000
IT WASN'T JUST IN MY HEAD - MONA

1:41:52.083 --> 1:41:55.166
...to every man,
woman and child in Israel.

1:41:56.791 --> 1:41:58.791
You, sorrowing mother.

1:41:59.541 --> 1:42:01.750
You, widowed wife.

1:42:02.666 --> 1:42:03.500
[sobs]

1:42:03.583 --> 1:42:06.958
You, the son
who lost a brother or a father.

1:42:07.708 --> 1:42:10.125
All the victims of war...

1:42:11.250 --> 1:42:15.333
fill the air and space
with recitals of peace.

1:42:15.541 --> 1:42:16.458
[sniffles]

1:42:16.541 --> 1:42:21.125
Fill bosoms and hearts
with the aspirations of peace.

1:42:22.041 --> 1:42:25.333
Make a reality that blossoms,

1:42:25.416 --> 1:42:26.416
and lives.

1:42:27.125 --> 1:42:31.625
Make hope a code of conduct and endeavor.

1:42:33.166 --> 1:42:36.791
And I have come here to deliver a message.

1:42:37.750 --> 1:42:41.625
I have delivered the message of peace.

1:42:42.041 --> 1:42:42.875
[sniffles]

1:42:42.958 --> 1:42:45.291
May God be my witness.

1:42:46.208 --> 1:42:48.208
Peace be upon you.

1:42:49.416 --> 1:42:51.166
[in Arabic] Peace be unto you.

1:43:21.916 --> 1:43:24.708
[Danny] How long has it been?
Nine, ten years?

1:43:25.750 --> 1:43:26.916
[Ashraf] It's been a while.

1:43:27.625 --> 1:43:29.125
How are Mona and Gamal?

1:43:29.500 --> 1:43:30.625
Gamal is fine.

1:43:31.375 --> 1:43:35.541
Mona and I have agreed not to divorce.
We will just live separately.

1:43:37.291 --> 1:43:41.083
Mona was sure I was meeting a lover,
Sami Sharaf helped dig that hole.

1:43:43.166 --> 1:43:45.166
This is how liars are rewarded.

1:43:45.458 --> 1:43:47.833
Even if you tell the truth,
no one believes you.

1:43:56.208 --> 1:43:57.166
[lighter clicks]

1:44:02.208 --> 1:44:03.208
For you.

1:44:04.708 --> 1:44:06.291
-What's this?
-Open it.

1:44:07.875 --> 1:44:09.875
[unwraps package]

1:44:15.458 --> 1:44:16.875
[Danny] The Boy Who Cried Wolf.

1:44:20.083 --> 1:44:21.500
I used to read it to Gamal.

1:44:22.083 --> 1:44:24.916
Little shepherd boy
who cried "Wolf!" twice,

1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:26.708
so the third time no one believed him.

1:44:30.291 --> 1:44:31.291
You're good.

1:44:34.375 --> 1:44:35.416
Thank you...

1:44:36.750 --> 1:44:37.750
for the book.

1:44:42.625 --> 1:44:44.458
It's great to see you again, Danny.

1:44:46.333 --> 1:44:47.333
You too, Ashraf.

1:44:58.250 --> 1:44:59.416
You know, Ashraf...

1:45:00.750 --> 1:45:02.708
there was a big inquiry after the war.

1:45:04.625 --> 1:45:05.625
About you...

1:45:06.458 --> 1:45:07.625
our conduct.

1:45:08.083 --> 1:45:09.208
I'm not surprised.

1:45:10.916 --> 1:45:14.166
A lot of questions,
a lot of finger-pointing.

1:45:17.458 --> 1:45:20.916
You know, if I had been there,
I would have asked them:

1:45:21.666 --> 1:45:24.625
''Is Israel better off
now that there is peace with Egypt?''

1:45:29.291 --> 1:45:32.708
Then, no matter what,
you and I have served our countries well.

1:45:36.166 --> 1:45:37.166
All the best.

1:45:38.375 --> 1:45:39.375
You take care.

1:45:44.166 --> 1:45:47.166
