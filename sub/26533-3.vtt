WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:04.526
Previously onCharmed...I have three!

00:04.569 --> 00:07.181
No! Mom!

00:07.224 --> 00:08.443
I think I'’m your sister.

00:08.486 --> 00:10.793
You are the Charmed Ones.

00:10.836 --> 00:12.664
Witches who are destined
to save the world

00:12.708 --> 00:14.057
from impending doom.

00:14.101 --> 00:16.886
They call me a Whitelighter.

00:16.929 --> 00:18.192
GALVIN: Apparently, a woman
from the cleaning crew claimed

00:18.235 --> 00:19.628
a black blob
tried to choke her,

00:19.671 --> 00:20.585
and then escaped
through an air vent.

00:20.629 --> 00:21.934
A black blob?

00:21.978 --> 00:24.241
I didn'’t tell you what
I knew about that demon.

00:24.285 --> 00:26.635
Left this behind. That black ooze,

00:26.678 --> 00:28.637
it'’s a primordial form
of the Harbinger.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.640
It'’s probably hunting for
a vessel-- a human vessel--

00:31.683 --> 00:32.902
and if it finds one,

00:32.945 --> 00:34.295
everything is going to change.

00:37.254 --> 00:39.256
You guys, when I said
we should do more cardio,

00:39.300 --> 00:40.562
I meant more like a spin class.

00:45.436 --> 00:48.048
Macy, we'’re gonna
have to bind it.

00:48.091 --> 00:49.310
Take out the elements.
This thing is too strong

00:49.353 --> 00:50.615
for me to freeze.

00:51.921 --> 00:53.705
MEL:
Maggie, your matches.

00:56.534 --> 00:59.102
Tell me you are not texting
during our binding spell.

00:59.146 --> 00:59.929
I don'’t think you realize
how precarious

00:59.972 --> 01:01.104
my situation at Kappa is.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.152
Oh, God.

01:07.937 --> 01:09.939
I'’ll stop it.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.594
Oh, God.

01:12.637 --> 01:14.291
What are you waiting for?!

01:14.335 --> 01:15.510
Hit him now!

01:19.122 --> 01:21.603
Screw it,
I'’ve got a spell for this.

01:21.646 --> 01:24.214
What are you talking about? Solaris incantatio!

01:34.137 --> 01:36.270
HARRY:
Failed simulation again.

01:39.229 --> 01:41.797
Melanie Vera, what
were you thinking?

01:41.840 --> 01:45.801
You know, save the day,
kick some demon ass.

01:45.844 --> 01:47.107
With one of the most
dangerous spells

01:47.150 --> 01:49.674
in all of witchcraft.Yeah. And it worked.

01:49.718 --> 01:51.285
Only because I ended
the simulation

01:51.328 --> 01:53.200
before you killed
your sisters.

01:53.243 --> 01:54.679
Speaking of, can we...
can we dial back the realism

01:54.723 --> 01:56.072
of these training sessions,

01:56.116 --> 01:57.029
because that was
super traumatic.

01:57.073 --> 01:58.509
I'’m a witch, Harry.

01:58.553 --> 01:59.641
You can'’t tell me
to hold back from being

01:59.684 --> 02:01.686
the best witch possible.

02:01.730 --> 02:03.471
I am simply telling you
to proceed with caution.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.299
As often as magic is
the solution to a problem,

02:05.342 --> 02:07.127
it can also be the cause.

02:08.998 --> 02:11.783
As for you, I am
deeply disappointed.

02:11.827 --> 02:14.482
I don'’t know what happened.Macy, you need to relax.

02:14.525 --> 02:15.744
I am relaxed.

02:15.787 --> 02:16.962
Magic isn'’t some test
you can ace.

02:17.006 --> 02:18.312
It should come
as natural as breathing.

02:18.355 --> 02:20.531
So, please, try and
stay out of your head.

02:20.575 --> 02:23.491
The only person who should
be in it is Maggie.

02:23.534 --> 02:25.188
A little telepath humor there.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.105
Hey!Witchcraft isn'’t a game.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.759
It requires constant focus.

02:30.802 --> 02:33.414
You said it was critical
we keep up our civilian lives.

02:33.457 --> 02:36.025
Not at the expense
of your duties.

02:36.068 --> 02:37.592
And not when the
Harbinger of Hell

02:37.635 --> 02:39.333
is running rampant
in Hilltowne.

02:39.376 --> 02:41.987
Fine. I'’ll pay more attention.

02:42.031 --> 02:44.338
Just please don'’t do
that horrible speech again.

02:44.381 --> 02:45.469
That black substance
Macy found was

02:45.513 --> 02:47.167
a telltale sign
of the Harbinger,

02:47.210 --> 02:49.778
one of the most powerful
forces in the underworld.

02:49.821 --> 02:50.909
And here we go.

02:50.953 --> 02:53.738
According to the
ancient texts,

02:53.782 --> 02:55.740
its sole purpose is to raise
the Source of All Evil,

02:55.784 --> 02:59.091
summoning its master
by tipping the scales to evil

02:59.135 --> 03:01.398
with a deluge of blood...

03:01.442 --> 03:03.139
ALL: And the deafening screams
of human torment.

03:04.662 --> 03:06.577
It sounds better in Sumerian.

03:06.621 --> 03:08.231
What does that even mean?

03:08.275 --> 03:10.625
We'’re not sure.

03:10.668 --> 03:14.063
As with most ancient texts,
it'’s heavy on metaphor.

03:14.106 --> 03:15.934
Wonderful.

03:15.978 --> 03:17.719
What we do know

03:17.762 --> 03:19.286
is that the Harbinger
couldn'’t have traveled far

03:19.329 --> 03:21.026
in its primordial form.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.289
So it must have taken
a human vessel

03:22.332 --> 03:23.507
somewhere near Macy'’s lab.

03:23.551 --> 03:26.206
Then let'’s get out there
and find it.

03:26.249 --> 03:27.859
But there are three

03:27.903 --> 03:29.687
academic buildings
on that side of campus.

03:29.731 --> 03:32.777
Plus the hospital.Don'’t forget half of Greek Row.

03:32.821 --> 03:35.954
They'’re right, Mel.
Let the Elders work out
where this vessel is.

03:35.998 --> 03:37.608
You want me to sit back while
a bunch of washed-up old witches

03:37.652 --> 03:39.915
do what I was destined to do?

03:39.958 --> 03:42.047
No. I want you to keep training
and show some respect

03:42.091 --> 03:45.050
for your wise and powerful
governing council.

03:45.094 --> 03:46.313
Because as soon as they do
find this demon

03:46.356 --> 03:47.749
of unspeakable horror,

03:47.792 --> 03:49.620
it will fall upon
you three to vanquish it,

03:49.664 --> 03:51.666
as the Charmed Ones.

03:51.709 --> 03:53.885
I'’m never gonna get
into this sorority, am I?

04:07.725 --> 04:10.424
Radical feminists have
criminalized masculinity.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.295
They call it "toxic."

04:12.339 --> 04:15.298
Why? Because they want
all the power for themselves.

04:15.342 --> 04:17.779
And believe me, they have power.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.911
Some of these witches have
more power than men...

04:27.397 --> 04:29.443
This better be good,
because I am in the middle

04:29.486 --> 04:32.141
of recording a pod...

04:32.184 --> 04:34.099
♪

04:40.845 --> 04:42.978
How do I find
the Harbinger of Hell?

04:56.470 --> 05:00.822
Oh, my God, Niko. Hi.

05:00.865 --> 05:02.040
You scared me.
Sorry.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.955
You weren'’t in bed
when my alarm went off.

05:03.999 --> 05:06.131
And I'’m a detective,
I have to investigate.

05:06.175 --> 05:08.351
Well, everything'’s okay.
Case closed.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.005
Have you been
up here all night?

05:10.048 --> 05:11.441
I couldn'’t sleep so
I started going through

05:11.485 --> 05:13.051
some of Mom'’s old papers.

05:13.095 --> 05:16.533
Please tell me you'’re not back
to obsessing over her death.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.230
That'’s not what this is.

05:18.274 --> 05:21.756
I promise.
It'’s for a class.

05:21.799 --> 05:23.758
I just don'’t want anything
to come between us again.

05:23.801 --> 05:26.456
Trust me,
nothing ever will.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.458
Okay.

05:30.242 --> 05:31.156
Mmm.

05:33.376 --> 05:36.118
Wow, when you put it
that way...

05:36.161 --> 05:38.642
Come on.

05:48.826 --> 05:51.220
Niko.

05:51.263 --> 05:53.353
I didn'’t know
you spent the night.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.703
See, I told you
we weren'’t that loud.

05:55.746 --> 05:58.183
And she was just leaving.

05:58.227 --> 05:59.533
Have a great day.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.493
:
Sorry, I didn'’t know.

06:03.537 --> 06:05.190
It'’s not your fault.

06:05.234 --> 06:06.801
She almost busted me with
The Book of Shadows,too.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.237
I don'’t know how much longer

06:08.280 --> 06:09.804
I'’m gonna be able to
keep this from her.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.283
What were you doing
with the Book?

06:11.327 --> 06:13.024
My duty as a Charmed One.

06:13.068 --> 06:15.026
Turns out there'’s a way
to lure every demon

06:15.070 --> 06:17.507
within a 26-mile radius
straight to us.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.857
All we have to do is
sacrifice a goat.

06:19.901 --> 06:22.817
Shouldn'’t we be doing
as we were told

06:22.860 --> 06:24.688
and leaving it to the Elders.

06:24.732 --> 06:27.256
Remember what happened
with the spirit board.

06:27.299 --> 06:30.128
Sugar?

06:30.172 --> 06:30.868
No, I take it black.

06:30.912 --> 06:33.175
Sugar!

06:33.218 --> 06:36.091
Shouting is not going to
make me want it any more.

06:36.134 --> 06:37.353
The other day,
when I tested

06:37.397 --> 06:38.528
that black residue
at the lab,

06:38.572 --> 06:40.356
it contained sulfuric acid.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.488
Everybody knows
what happens

06:41.531 --> 06:43.359
when you combine that
with sugar.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.969
Hate to break it to you,
but that is in no way

06:45.013 --> 06:47.015
common knowledge outside
the nerd community.

06:47.058 --> 06:49.713
You know how vinegar
and baking soda causes
a chemical reaction?

06:49.757 --> 06:53.413
Sulfuric acid and sugar--
same thing, on steroids.

06:57.721 --> 06:58.983
Another reason to love Stevia.

06:59.027 --> 07:02.770
Wait, this could work.
Especially on Halloween.

07:02.813 --> 07:05.642
We give out candy at the lab,
the Women'’s Studies department.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.470
Anywhere it could have
taken a vessel.

07:07.514 --> 07:08.906
And if anybody pukes up
black stuff, we'’ll know

07:08.950 --> 07:10.734
it'’s the Harbinger and then
we use the binding spell

07:10.778 --> 07:11.605
to trap them.

07:11.648 --> 07:12.606
The sugar ratios would

07:12.649 --> 07:14.172
have to be precise, though.

07:14.216 --> 07:16.174
Maybe I could
bake something.

07:16.218 --> 07:20.265
Cookies, shortbread.
I make a mean chocolate soufflé.

07:20.309 --> 07:23.007
What? Baking calms me.

07:23.051 --> 07:25.793
Yeah, let'’s stick with cookies.Okay.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.055
Well, as much as
I'’d love to help

07:27.098 --> 07:28.578
with Operation Cookie Monster,

07:28.622 --> 07:30.493
I'’ve got bigger problems.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.974
Let me guess.
Kappa crisis?

07:33.017 --> 07:35.498
I owe Lucy 200 bucks
for a pledge retreat,

07:35.542 --> 07:38.109
so I had to pick up
an extra shift.

07:38.153 --> 07:40.416
You'’re right.
That is way more important

07:40.460 --> 07:42.810
than saving the world
from certain doom.

07:42.853 --> 07:47.205
Snark away, but I'’m not
the only one with priorities.

07:47.249 --> 07:49.947
Right, Macy?
Boundaries!

07:49.991 --> 07:53.603
Sorry. But just because
you were wondering, relax.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.997
Galvin'’s gonna think you're
a snack in that outfit.

08:00.305 --> 08:01.568
And I'’m really sorry.

08:01.611 --> 08:03.439
Our delivery truck
broke down, I...

08:03.483 --> 08:06.181
Sweetheart, I didn'’t
come here for excuses.

08:06.224 --> 08:07.399
I came for the chicken.

08:07.443 --> 08:09.532
Excuse me.

08:09.576 --> 08:12.143
I hate to interrupt.
I'’m not a doctor,

08:12.187 --> 08:14.319
but I'’ve watched my fair
share of Grey'’s Anatomy.

08:14.363 --> 08:15.973
I think this man'’s
going through

08:16.017 --> 08:17.192
acute poultry withdrawal.

08:17.235 --> 08:18.889
Hey, smart-ass,

08:18.933 --> 08:20.848
nobody asked you.See?

08:20.891 --> 08:23.154
Key symptoms are irritability
and being a dick

08:23.198 --> 08:24.634
to service professionals.

08:24.678 --> 08:26.506
This man needs help.

08:28.725 --> 08:32.860
There'’s a KFC
two blocks away.

08:32.903 --> 08:35.427
♪ The magic is, the magic
is gone, the magic is gone ♪

08:35.471 --> 08:36.994
♪ The magic is gone...

08:37.038 --> 08:38.822
Thank you.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.955
I so badly wanted
to tell him off,

08:40.998 --> 08:43.348
but you know,
the customer'’s always right.

08:43.392 --> 08:46.351
Is he, or is he just a douche
looking to score a free dessert?

08:46.395 --> 08:48.353
I come here for brunch
all the time.

08:48.397 --> 08:49.964
I'’ve never seen you.

08:50.007 --> 08:53.184
Um, maybe you... maybe
you just didn'’t notice me.

08:53.228 --> 08:54.446
Not possible.

08:54.490 --> 08:58.625
Oh, well, I...
I usually work nights.

08:58.668 --> 08:59.930
Then maybe I'’ll see you
for dinner sometime.

08:59.974 --> 09:02.498
I hear this place does
a mean chicken.

09:07.416 --> 09:11.594
LUCY : It took a lot
or personal sacrifice,

09:11.638 --> 09:15.642
but thanks to our vigils,
Angela is now back on her feet.

09:15.685 --> 09:17.948
HEIDI: Maybe the administration
will overturn their

09:17.992 --> 09:19.950
fascist booze ban
now that she'’s awake.

09:19.994 --> 09:23.606
Yeah, I'’m not sure my
slutty baby costume

09:23.650 --> 09:25.956
is appropriate for
a sober Halloween mixer.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.741
Oh, Maggie.

09:29.699 --> 09:30.918
You'’ve been so MIA lately,

09:30.961 --> 09:32.876
missing all those
pledge events,

09:32.920 --> 09:34.617
I didn'’t know how
else to find you.

09:34.661 --> 09:38.142
I am so sorry, I just...

09:38.186 --> 09:39.753
I'’ve been juggling a lot.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.885
Oh. Okay.

09:41.929 --> 09:44.192
Will you excuse us for a moment?

09:44.235 --> 09:47.195
Maggie.

09:47.238 --> 09:49.893
Girl, you have been
through so much lately,

09:49.937 --> 09:52.635
and I get that,
but I fought super hard

09:52.679 --> 09:54.332
for you to get this bid,

09:54.376 --> 09:57.422
and I need to know that
you'’re taking it seriously.

09:57.466 --> 09:59.511
I-I am. I really am, I...

09:59.555 --> 10:00.643
It'’s okay, I'm still
on your side.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.253
And I want to make this work.

10:02.297 --> 10:05.517
Which is why you have to
convince the rest of the house

10:05.561 --> 10:06.649
that you still want in.

10:12.568 --> 10:14.135
What if I found us
a place off-campus

10:14.178 --> 10:16.180
to host
the Halloween mixer?

10:16.224 --> 10:19.575
I mean, if you could get us
around the booze ban,

10:19.619 --> 10:24.145
you would me a Kappa legend.

10:24.188 --> 10:25.799
G.T.A. evals are coming up,

10:25.842 --> 10:28.453
so I'’ve decided to bribe
you all with cookies.

10:28.497 --> 10:30.760
I'’ve got regular,
vegan, and gluten-free.

10:30.804 --> 10:33.633
Says she has no memory
of how she went into the coma.

10:33.676 --> 10:37.114
Wait. Who are you talking about?

10:37.158 --> 10:38.899
Angela Wu. She'’s awake.

10:48.996 --> 10:50.562
I thought we agreed
to stop being so reckless

10:50.606 --> 10:51.955
with our magic.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.653
You gave a pompous lecture,

10:53.696 --> 10:55.437
I chose to ignore it
and take some initiative.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.613
Have you seen this?

10:57.657 --> 11:01.269
Was that exactly where you were
standing when you stopped time?

11:01.312 --> 11:02.879
It'’s in the general vicinity.

11:02.923 --> 11:04.707
What if, when you
restart time,

11:04.751 --> 11:07.667
one of your students
notices your arm

11:07.710 --> 11:09.103
just appears in
a new position,

11:09.146 --> 11:11.105
and they get curious
and snoop and discover

11:11.148 --> 11:12.454
you'’re a witch?
You could get blackmailed,

11:12.497 --> 11:13.890
you could lose your job.
People would fear

11:13.934 --> 11:15.718
you'’ve gone mad.Uh, do you
have to turn

11:15.762 --> 11:17.720
everything
into a teachable moment?

11:17.764 --> 11:19.461
Do you remember Angela Wu?

11:19.504 --> 11:20.767
Yes, your mother'’s student.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.246
The one harassed
by Professor Thaine.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.161
It turns out,
she woke up from her coma

11:24.205 --> 11:25.902
the same night
we found the Harbinger'’s residue

11:25.946 --> 11:27.774
in the hospital,

11:27.817 --> 11:29.297
right next to Macy'’s lab.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.735
She could be the vessel.

11:32.779 --> 11:35.346
Please do not take credit
for my ideas, white man.

11:35.390 --> 11:36.652
I figured it out,

11:36.696 --> 11:40.134
I get to give her the cookie.

11:40.177 --> 11:42.919
You'’re gonna feed a demon
a pumpkin biscuit?

11:42.963 --> 11:44.921
Pumpkin cookie.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.575
And Macy figured out
how to use sugar

11:46.618 --> 11:49.230
to react with the sulfuric acid
in the Harbinger'’s blood.

11:49.273 --> 11:51.536
Oh, well, that-- yes,
that'’s actually quite clever.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.756
Or at least, it would be, if
I hadn'’t given explicit orders

11:53.800 --> 11:55.540
to wait.For the Elders?

11:55.584 --> 11:57.760
Yeah. I ignored that, too.

11:57.804 --> 12:00.154
I mean, we don'’t have
time to wait for some

12:00.197 --> 12:02.069
old-fashioned bureaucracy
to get this done.

12:05.637 --> 12:07.291
What the hell is this?

12:07.335 --> 12:09.076
A jaunty bit of arm bling.

12:09.119 --> 12:11.121
And a lecture you
can'’t ignore.

12:11.165 --> 12:14.603
From now on, every time you
use magic, I'’ll be notified.

12:14.646 --> 12:15.691
You can'’t do that.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.476
It'’s for your own good.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.851
No costume?

12:44.894 --> 12:47.462
I didn'’t want to wear something
weird and embarrass myself

12:47.505 --> 12:49.246
in front of the entire lab.

12:49.290 --> 12:51.422
What, you mean, like,
a group DNA helix outfit?

12:51.466 --> 12:52.859
Even worse,

12:52.902 --> 12:54.599
DNA helix
without cytosine.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.428
Berkowitz called in sick.

12:57.472 --> 12:58.865
I don'’t blame him.

12:58.908 --> 13:00.083
All right,
now you'’re in trouble.

13:00.127 --> 13:01.693
You are in trouble.

13:07.525 --> 13:08.962
Hmm.

13:10.615 --> 13:13.053
What are you doing?

13:14.750 --> 13:16.360
Cytosine.

13:16.404 --> 13:18.493
Macy Vaughn, you complete me.

13:20.147 --> 13:22.802
So, Dr. Cytosine,

13:22.845 --> 13:24.542
what do you say
we, uh,

13:24.586 --> 13:25.892
grab dinner tonight?

13:25.935 --> 13:27.981
Costumes optional.

13:28.024 --> 13:30.287
MAGGIE:
So what did you say?

13:30.331 --> 13:32.159
MACY :
Well, I said no.Macy.

13:32.202 --> 13:34.378
He'’s obviously
so in love with you.

13:34.422 --> 13:36.380
We work together.
The last thing I need

13:36.424 --> 13:38.121
is some tumultuous breakup
jeopardizing my career.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.080
PENELOPE: Sex and booze
are a sure way to lose.

13:40.123 --> 13:43.213
Sex and booze
are a sure way to lose.

13:43.257 --> 13:44.780
MAGGIE: You realize this
is the exact same thing

13:44.824 --> 13:46.390
you were doing with your powers?

13:46.434 --> 13:47.870
Getting lost in your head
instead of letting

13:47.914 --> 13:49.611
this love story play out?

13:49.654 --> 13:51.395
No, Maggie, I'’m being realistic.

13:51.439 --> 13:53.658
Now, I need to go
get more cookie supplies,

13:53.702 --> 13:55.573
so I'’ll see you at home.

14:04.887 --> 14:05.845
Angela.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.411
Hi.
Mel.

14:07.455 --> 14:09.500
Hi.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.502
I'’ve been looking
all over for you.

14:11.546 --> 14:13.243
Would you mind if we went
somewhere to talk in private?

14:13.287 --> 14:15.463
No, I wouldn'’t mind that at all.

14:35.352 --> 14:36.919
Oh, please tell me
there'’s a spell in there

14:36.963 --> 14:38.312
to make this place Kappa-worthy.

14:44.448 --> 14:46.842
"Glamours. Spells to alter

14:46.886 --> 14:50.454
the appearance
of people and objects."

14:50.498 --> 14:52.413
Yes, please.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.389
I just want to walk across
that quad without everyone

15:12.433 --> 15:15.088
staring at me like I'’m
some helpless victim.

15:15.131 --> 15:18.743
Not Professor Thaine'’s
accuser, not Coma Girl.

15:18.787 --> 15:21.268
Just a normal,
unassuming student.

15:21.311 --> 15:24.140
That sounds really tough.

15:27.491 --> 15:31.191
I know a cookie won'’t
make things better,

15:31.234 --> 15:34.672
but...
I brought you these.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.718
: Oh.
Thanks, but I...

15:36.761 --> 15:39.242
still haven'’t really gotten
my appetite back yet.

15:39.286 --> 15:41.157
Oh.

15:41.201 --> 15:43.464
So what did you want
to talk about

15:43.507 --> 15:48.991
My mom, um...
there was an accident.

15:49.035 --> 15:51.907
She'’s dead.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.605
Mel.

15:57.652 --> 16:00.611
I'’m so sorry.

16:03.788 --> 16:08.402
She was really special.

16:11.057 --> 16:15.409
These were actually her recipe.

16:17.715 --> 16:19.543
You sure you don'’t
want to try one?

16:19.587 --> 16:21.110
I guess one couldn'’t hurt.

16:21.154 --> 16:22.285
Yeah.

16:29.597 --> 16:31.947
Delicious.

16:35.559 --> 16:37.909
I'’ll let you get some rest.

16:41.826 --> 16:44.307
It was really good
seeing you, Angela.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.266
You, too, Mel.

16:51.619 --> 16:53.577
Bye.
Bye.

17:27.959 --> 17:31.050
Niko. What are you doing here?

17:31.093 --> 17:33.008
Uh, a student'’s parents
reported him missing.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.966
Really?It'’s probably nothing,

17:35.010 --> 17:36.142
just sleeping it off
in a bush somewhere,

17:36.185 --> 17:38.622
but I had to follow up.

17:38.666 --> 17:41.103
So, you gonna tell me why
you came to see Angela Wu?

17:41.147 --> 17:42.713
She woke up from a coma.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.324
I wanted to see
how she was doing.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.152
This has nothing
to do with Mom.

17:46.195 --> 17:48.110
Then why do I feel
like you'’re hiding something?

17:51.200 --> 17:53.550
Because I am, all right?

17:53.594 --> 17:56.292
I am a demon-hunting witch who'’s
supposed to save the world,

17:56.336 --> 17:58.599
and all I want to do

17:58.642 --> 18:00.949
is tell you, but I can'’t.

18:02.255 --> 18:04.126
You'’ve got to be kidding me.

18:04.170 --> 18:07.390
I assumed the only reason
you'’d use magic would be

18:07.434 --> 18:10.176
if you found the Harbinger
and required assistance.

18:10.219 --> 18:12.308
No. I checked Angela Wu,
and it wasn'’t her.

18:12.352 --> 18:15.355
Now can you leave?
This is a private moment.

18:15.398 --> 18:18.314
You do know you can
never tell her.Of course I know that.

18:18.358 --> 18:20.316
Why do you think
I'’m freezing time to have

18:20.360 --> 18:21.665
an honest conversation with her?

18:21.709 --> 18:23.058
I'’m sensing a bit of cynicism.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.320
Yet another one of your
astonishing powers.

18:24.364 --> 18:26.322
Now get out of here.

18:26.366 --> 18:29.586
'’Cause I'm restarting time
in three, two...

18:33.068 --> 18:35.897
I promise,
I'’m not hiding anything.

18:37.246 --> 18:38.943
Get back to work.

18:43.513 --> 18:45.472
Hey.

18:45.515 --> 18:47.300
Got it, thanks.

18:47.343 --> 18:50.303
Lab mates ate all my cookies,
so back to the kitchen.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.305
At least none of them
are the Harbinger.

18:52.348 --> 18:54.872
Same goes with the
Women'’s Studies department
and Angela Wu.

18:54.916 --> 18:57.092
Uh, shouldn'’t we just check
if Harry has any better ideas?

18:57.136 --> 18:58.267
No, we'’re not gonna call him...Harry.

18:59.529 --> 19:01.183
HARRY:
I must say,

19:01.227 --> 19:03.054
it'’s awfully nice
to be summoned by a witch

19:03.098 --> 19:04.752
who respects
my position

19:04.795 --> 19:07.363
and the sanctity of magic.

19:07.407 --> 19:09.844
What'’s he talking about?

19:09.887 --> 19:11.585
Our Whitelighter, the head of
the Women'’s Studies department,

19:11.628 --> 19:12.890
put a tracker on me

19:12.934 --> 19:14.849
to alert him any
time I use magic,

19:14.892 --> 19:17.025
because he is threatened
by the idea of a powerful woman.

19:17.068 --> 19:19.462
Harry.Now just wait a second.
That last part is fake news.

19:27.383 --> 19:28.645
Does anyone
know anything

19:28.689 --> 19:30.081
about a party here tonight?

19:31.431 --> 19:33.476
Maggie.
Maggie.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.918
You guys,

19:40.962 --> 19:44.835
I'’m pretty sure
Martha Stewart is a witch.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.794
You invited Gavin
behind my back.

19:46.837 --> 19:48.012
I wanted to surprise you.

19:48.056 --> 19:49.884
Do I look like someone
who enjoys surprises?

19:49.927 --> 19:51.407
Okay, I know.

19:51.451 --> 19:54.149
Boundaries. But hear me out:

19:54.193 --> 19:56.847
I was thinking about
this whole Harbinger thing. I...

19:56.891 --> 19:57.674
No, you weren'’t.I so was.

19:57.718 --> 20:00.677
And I thought to myself,

20:00.721 --> 20:03.941
"Maggie, why walk around campus
handing out one cookie at a time

20:03.985 --> 20:06.466
"when you could
invite 200 people here

20:06.509 --> 20:08.468
and test them out all at once?"

20:08.511 --> 20:09.991
So this has nothing to do
with your sorority?

20:10.034 --> 20:12.167
Well, I mean, coincidentally,

20:12.211 --> 20:14.430
it might keep me from
getting kicked out of Kappa,

20:14.474 --> 20:17.303
but that'’s just the icing.

20:17.346 --> 20:19.305
The cake is totally
for you guys.

20:19.348 --> 20:21.959
Because I so want
to help save the world.

20:22.003 --> 20:23.483
MACY:
We couldrule out

20:23.526 --> 20:25.441
most of the Greek system
in a matter of hours.

20:25.485 --> 20:29.097
And I'’m guessing your precious
Elders haven'’t come up with

20:29.140 --> 20:30.794
anything better?

20:34.929 --> 20:37.279
Very well...

20:37.323 --> 20:38.411
Yes!

20:38.454 --> 20:39.542
As long as we stay on task,

20:39.586 --> 20:41.501
and remain vigilant.

20:41.544 --> 20:43.981
There'’s no telling
when the Harbinger might strike.

20:48.334 --> 20:50.858
I really thought
there'’d be more people here.

20:52.381 --> 20:53.469

that costume.

21:48.916 --> 21:51.614
I mean, my Insta is lighting up.

21:51.658 --> 21:54.791
I am kind of bummed
about the bar, though.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.315
It'’s, like, 10:00,

21:56.358 --> 21:58.229
and you'’re already
out of skinny margaritas?

21:58.273 --> 22:01.624
Oh, we totally have more.Oh, you do?

22:01.668 --> 22:03.191
Yeah, I mean,
this is a Kappa party, right?

22:03.234 --> 22:04.497
Yes, it is.

22:04.540 --> 22:05.628
Kappa, Kappa. Go get

22:05.672 --> 22:06.890
those drinks, girl.Okay.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.610
I don'’t know
what you'’re talking about.

22:30.653 --> 22:33.482
Maggie, our spells rely
on a system of balance.

22:33.526 --> 22:35.354
So when magic is used
for personal gain,

22:35.397 --> 22:37.268
say, to wallow
in the superficiality

22:37.312 --> 22:39.575
of the Greek system, or
to live your "best life"

22:39.619 --> 22:41.403
on the Snapchat,

22:41.447 --> 22:43.100
I can assure you

22:43.144 --> 22:44.188
there will be
personal consequences.

22:47.496 --> 22:49.846
Hold that thought, Harry,
and give these margs

22:49.890 --> 22:52.501
to the zombie beauty queen
and slutty baby.

22:52.545 --> 22:54.416
What is it with your
generation'’s obsession

22:54.460 --> 22:56.200
with offensive costumes?

22:58.377 --> 23:00.074
Please tell me
that'’s a two-part costume

23:00.117 --> 23:01.336
and there'’s lingerie
under there.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.294
I'’m Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

23:03.338 --> 23:05.427
Wrong. You'’re a weirdo
in a trash bag.

23:05.471 --> 23:06.950
This is Halloween.

23:06.994 --> 23:08.604
And when Galvin sees you,

23:08.648 --> 23:11.433
there'’s only one thing
you want him to say.

23:11.477 --> 23:15.611
I have never wanted anyone more
than I want you right now.

23:15.655 --> 23:17.787
I guess I got you
under my spell.

23:17.831 --> 23:18.962
Oh, is that what this is?Mm-hmm.

23:19.006 --> 23:20.616
Well, what other
kind of magic

23:20.660 --> 23:21.878
can a witch like you do?

23:21.922 --> 23:23.880
This one time, I manifested

23:23.924 --> 23:27.667
a sonic boom
that blew up a bone demon.

23:27.710 --> 23:29.364
That is an oddly
specific fantasy,

23:29.408 --> 23:30.452
but I'’m so down.

23:38.852 --> 23:40.897
I better take this.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.381
What about...

23:46.425 --> 23:47.774
Lara Croft?

23:47.817 --> 23:49.428
Absolutely not.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.821
Are you insane?
No.

23:51.865 --> 23:53.301
But I am running out of ideas.

23:53.344 --> 23:56.391
Why are you so allergic
to being sexy?

23:56.435 --> 23:58.654
Stay out of my head.I wouldn'’t have to

23:58.698 --> 24:00.743
read your thoughts if you'’d just
talk to me and be my sister.

24:08.098 --> 24:10.057
Okay.

24:10.100 --> 24:13.103
When I was in ninth grade,

24:13.147 --> 24:17.499
my dad sent me to boarding
school in Connecticut.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.719
Yeah.

24:19.762 --> 24:23.897
Uh, in a class of a hundred
kids, two of us weren'’t white.

24:23.940 --> 24:27.335
In that environment,
you had to solidify

24:27.378 --> 24:32.775
what type of minority you were,
before they decided for you.

24:32.819 --> 24:37.171
So my friend Tasha became,
you know, the sexy, funny one,

24:37.214 --> 24:41.610
and I was always
the smart, serious one.

24:41.654 --> 24:44.352
I'’ve played that
part for so long,

24:44.395 --> 24:46.659
I don'’t know
how to be anything else.

24:57.887 --> 25:01.021
You'’re smart and you're sexy.

25:01.064 --> 25:03.458
You'’re funny
and you'’re serious.

25:03.502 --> 25:07.244
And screw anyone who tries
to put you in a box.

25:15.775 --> 25:17.559

25:32.531 --> 25:34.097
Three bodies

25:34.141 --> 25:35.795
Really

Cam Russo and Penelope Schnurr.Cam?

25:39.929 --> 25:41.714

a nun was found

25:41.757 --> 25:43.324
dead at Campus Ministry.

25:43.367 --> 25:45.587
I got to go. I'’m sorry.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.546
Yeah.

26:04.867 --> 26:06.608
Wow.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.479
Not so bad yourself.

26:08.523 --> 26:10.960
Let me guess:

26:11.004 --> 26:13.006
Persephone,

26:13.049 --> 26:14.224
goddess of the underworld?

26:14.268 --> 26:15.574
Very impressive.

26:16.662 --> 26:18.141

as played by Idris Elba.

26:20.491 --> 26:22.755

he was always meant to be.

26:24.060 --> 26:26.236
So, does this mean

26:26.280 --> 26:28.064
you changed your mind
about that date?

26:28.108 --> 26:29.500
Well...
MEL:
Sister emergency,

26:29.544 --> 26:31.459
I need to borrow Macy right now.
I'’m sorry.

26:31.502 --> 26:32.591
I...

26:37.508 --> 26:40.903
One victim at an abstinence
club, another was a nun.

26:40.947 --> 26:42.252
Ew, you think
it'’s hunting virgins?

26:42.296 --> 26:44.211
Yeah.What about Cam?

26:44.254 --> 26:45.255
Oh, he was obviously an incel.

26:46.517 --> 26:48.476
Involuntary celibate?

26:48.519 --> 26:49.869
Virgin blood is a powerful
energy source for demons.

26:49.912 --> 26:51.392
If this demon wants

26:51.435 --> 26:52.872
to strengthen its vessel,

26:52.915 --> 26:55.483
then no virgin in Hilltowne
is safe.

26:55.526 --> 26:57.485
MEL: Maggie, we have to pull
the plug on this party.

26:57.528 --> 26:58.791
You want to send
my friends home

26:58.834 --> 27:01.445
while there'’s a killer
on the loose?

27:01.489 --> 27:04.100
What if any of them are virgins?

27:04.144 --> 27:05.624
Okay, I know for a fact
that some of the Kappas

27:05.667 --> 27:07.626
have only let guys put it in...

27:07.669 --> 27:09.192
Sexual proclivities aside,
she'’s right, Mel.

This house may be the safest
place for them.

27:11.151 --> 27:12.369
MACY:
Then what if we seal off

27:12.413 --> 27:13.936
the place
with a protection spell,

27:13.980 --> 27:15.938
to keep demons from entering?

27:15.982 --> 27:17.984
MEL: Fine, but once
the house is sealed,

27:18.027 --> 27:19.289
we go out hunting.

27:19.333 --> 27:20.987
Done. Macy,

27:21.030 --> 27:21.988
your mother'’s candle
collection will contain

27:22.031 --> 27:23.511
one made of rosethorn.

Find it.

27:24.773 --> 27:26.035
Maggie,

27:26.079 --> 27:27.689
we'’ll need some dried sage.

29:12.228 --> 29:14.187
without you showing up
to berate me.

29:14.230 --> 29:16.450
Mel, the last thing I wish to do

29:16.493 --> 29:18.800
is put up barriers between you
and the woman you'’re dating.

29:18.844 --> 29:23.065
She'’s more than that.

29:23.109 --> 29:25.981

how painful this is.

29:26.025 --> 29:27.983

29:32.509 --> 29:35.730
She knew I was gay
before I even figured it out.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.428
And she made sure
I was always proud

29:38.472 --> 29:41.214
of who I was.

29:41.257 --> 29:45.914
So I have never been
in the closet.

29:45.958 --> 29:49.483
I'’ve never had to hide who I am
from the people I love.

29:49.526 --> 29:53.661
It was the biggest gift
she gave me.

29:53.704 --> 29:58.753

30:39.663 --> 30:41.752
if I'’m headed down a one-way
street, I need to know.

30:41.796 --> 30:43.537
I promise we will talk
about this, but first,

30:43.580 --> 30:46.496
I need to handle a sister thing.

Once the spell is cast,

31:03.687 --> 31:05.776
no magical entities,
including ourselves,

31:05.820 --> 31:07.691
will be able to cross
the circle.

31:35.545 --> 31:36.895
Why isn'’t it working?

31:36.938 --> 31:38.635
Well, if the house
can'’t be sealed off,

31:38.679 --> 31:40.115
there'’s only one explanation.

31:40.159 --> 31:43.118
The Harbinger'’s inside.No, Mel. Don'’t.

31:43.162 --> 31:45.642
The demon'’s far too powerful.

31:45.686 --> 31:47.557
All that'’ll do is
freeze your friends

31:47.601 --> 31:48.471
and make them easier prey.

31:48.515 --> 31:50.125
Then what are we supposed to do?

31:50.169 --> 31:52.911
When you want to lure a shark,
you don'’t use live bait.

31:52.954 --> 31:55.696
You chum the water.
MEL:
Great.

31:55.739 --> 31:57.741
But where are we gonna get
our hands on virgin blood?

31:57.785 --> 31:58.742
Right here.

32:21.287 --> 32:24.290
Wait, so is this why you'’ve been
so weird about dating Galvin?

32:24.333 --> 32:25.726
I'’m not being weird
about dating Galvin.

32:25.769 --> 32:27.336
I'’ve been cautious.

32:27.380 --> 32:29.991
And, yes, maybe a part of that
is me being a virgin.

32:30.035 --> 32:31.558
Back in high school,

32:31.601 --> 32:33.429
I wanted my first time
to be perfect.

32:33.473 --> 32:35.997
You know? Perfect place
with the perfect guy...

32:36.041 --> 32:37.433
Yeah, but there'’s
no such thing as...MACY: Perfect?

32:37.477 --> 32:39.827
No kidding. Especially once
I started analyzing

32:39.870 --> 32:41.611
the statistical probability
of an unplanned pregnancy,

32:41.655 --> 32:43.135
the transmission rate of HPV...

32:43.178 --> 32:45.789
I really psyched myself out.

32:45.833 --> 32:47.139
I had sex with a guy once.

32:47.182 --> 32:49.010
You'’re not missing out.

32:49.054 --> 32:50.229
Yeah, and it'’s totally normal

32:50.272 --> 32:51.056
to be freaked out
about your first time.

32:51.099 --> 32:52.927
Maybe at 18.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.885
Not at 28.

32:54.929 --> 32:57.801
Because now, whenever I tell
people, they react like this.

32:57.845 --> 32:59.847
No, we were just surprised.The concept of virginity
is really just

32:59.890 --> 33:01.892
a tool of the patriarchy
to control our sexuality.

33:01.936 --> 33:04.678
Could we stop talking about this
and go vanquish this demon?

33:27.179 --> 33:29.920
We'’re only gonna get one chance
at this binding spell.

33:29.964 --> 33:33.663
And we can'’t afford
any juvenile mistakes.

33:33.707 --> 33:35.665
MAGGIE:
What?

33:35.709 --> 33:37.493

Shh. Shh, quiet.

33:44.326 --> 33:46.720
It'’s coming.

33:54.684 --> 33:56.121
Angela?

33:56.164 --> 33:57.905
But I watched her
eat that cookie.

33:57.948 --> 33:58.819
Oh...

34:00.690 --> 34:02.214
Now.

34:02.257 --> 34:03.693

Oh...

34:14.095 --> 34:16.097
MAGGIE:
Macy!

34:16.141 --> 34:18.230
I warned you these glamours
would have consequences.

34:18.273 --> 34:20.275
I'’ve got this.

34:21.624 --> 34:23.191
I'’ll turn them off.

34:23.235 --> 34:24.714

34:30.677 --> 34:32.157
Yeah.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.072
Let'’s go.

34:52.177 --> 34:54.048
Macy, I'’m coming!

35:09.237 --> 35:10.804
I'’m so sorry.

35:10.847 --> 35:12.893
I don'’t know if
it'’s the adrenaline

35:12.936 --> 35:14.590
or the glimpse of certain death,

35:14.634 --> 35:16.114
but when I was running, I didn'’t
even have time to think.

35:16.157 --> 35:17.463
All I could do was react
and it worked.

35:17.506 --> 35:18.464
My powers worked!

35:18.507 --> 35:19.813
You'’re super excited

35:19.856 --> 35:21.467

almost just got eaten.

35:22.598 --> 35:23.991
MEL:
Guys!

35:24.034 --> 35:25.210
Get down!

35:25.253 --> 35:26.950
No! Not the spell.

35:57.416 --> 35:58.373
Oh, God.

35:58.417 --> 35:59.722
Macy?

35:59.766 --> 36:00.767
Let'’s just hope it's shock.

36:02.551 --> 36:04.205
Please, this is not happening.

36:04.249 --> 36:05.598
Macy, come on.

36:05.641 --> 36:06.903
Come on.

36:08.818 --> 36:10.864
Oh, God.

36:10.907 --> 36:12.561
Are you okay?

36:12.605 --> 36:14.607
Oh, thank God.
Oh, God.

36:14.650 --> 36:15.651
I thought...
I am so, so sorry.

36:15.695 --> 36:17.175
Oh, God.

36:17.218 --> 36:18.263
Okay.

36:18.306 --> 36:19.264
Uh...

36:19.307 --> 36:20.656
Will you ever forgive me?

36:22.223 --> 36:23.529
You did save my life.

36:23.572 --> 36:25.400
I think I can let this slide.

36:25.444 --> 36:26.532
Come on.
Come on.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.928
What do we do about her?

36:36.237 --> 36:38.718
Well, the Elders will
want to weigh in.

36:38.761 --> 36:41.155
Why don'’t you go
clear out the house?

36:41.199 --> 36:43.113
I'’ll handle things here.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.902
Harry...

36:48.945 --> 36:51.252
you were right.

36:51.296 --> 36:52.906
I was being reckless

36:52.949 --> 36:54.386
and I almost killed Macy.

36:54.429 --> 36:57.519
See? Teachable moment.

36:57.563 --> 36:59.826
But lest you forget,

36:59.869 --> 37:02.045
you also brought down
an immensely powerful demon

37:02.089 --> 37:04.047
and you were
the first to suspect

37:04.091 --> 37:05.919
Angela Wu might
be the vessel.

37:05.962 --> 37:07.486
Hold on.

37:07.529 --> 37:08.748
Was that a compliment?

37:11.098 --> 37:12.404
You really are
just like her.

37:15.058 --> 37:16.625
Like my mom?

37:16.669 --> 37:18.801
No.

37:18.845 --> 37:21.630
Then who

37:27.767 --> 37:29.725
There is a reason

37:29.769 --> 37:31.858
I'’ve been so hard on you.

37:31.901 --> 37:33.686
You'’re not the only witches
I'’ve ever looked after.

37:35.340 --> 37:38.299
Her name was Fiona.

37:38.343 --> 37:40.562
She was passionate,
talented...

37:40.606 --> 37:42.085
and stubborn,
like you.

37:44.218 --> 37:45.088
What happened to her?

37:47.482 --> 37:50.006
She trusted the wrong
person with her secret.

37:51.443 --> 37:53.923
Fiona was...

37:53.967 --> 37:55.490
institutionalized.

37:55.534 --> 37:57.579
They thought she
was schizophrenic

37:57.623 --> 38:00.278
and drugged her until
she doubted the truth.

38:02.367 --> 38:04.238
And then...

38:04.282 --> 38:07.328
finally...

38:07.372 --> 38:09.722
she couldn'’t
take it anymore.

38:16.685 --> 38:19.427
Losing her made
me who I am.

38:19.471 --> 38:22.212
Vigilant.

38:22.256 --> 38:24.258
Protective.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.216
And I suppose that'’s why

38:26.260 --> 38:28.915
I was given the honor of
serving alongside you three.

38:32.092 --> 38:34.050
I'’m not gonna tell Niko.

38:34.094 --> 38:35.574
For now.

38:35.617 --> 38:39.795
But Harry,
I'’m not Fiona.

38:39.839 --> 38:42.015
I'’m not gonna be
reckless anymore.

38:50.284 --> 38:55.071
When this war against evil
is no longer at our doorstep,

38:55.115 --> 38:57.683
I will help you get
permission to tell her.

39:00.294 --> 39:01.556
Okay.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.297
Do you mind
if we slow down?

39:03.341 --> 39:04.907
I did just almost die.

39:04.951 --> 39:06.387
Can'’t. I have to do
damage control.

39:06.431 --> 39:08.084
With the glamours gone, Lucy
might be sucking on a lime

39:08.128 --> 39:09.912
instead of a skinny marg.

39:09.956 --> 39:11.523
You run on ahead, but you
might want to do something

39:11.566 --> 39:13.829
about the giant wart
that'’s appeared on your chin.

39:13.873 --> 39:16.136
Oh! Stupid personal gain
consequences.

39:20.314 --> 39:21.707
Hey, I didn'’t know if
you were coming back or...

39:27.060 --> 39:28.714
♪

39:35.198 --> 39:36.374
Hi.

39:40.421 --> 39:41.814
MAN:
All right, cool, man.

39:41.857 --> 39:44.120
Lucy, wait.

39:44.164 --> 39:47.559
Look, I know this party
wasn'’t perfect

39:47.602 --> 39:51.389
and maybe the Cinderella theme
was too much, but...LUCY: Oh...

39:51.432 --> 39:53.042
I get it now.

39:53.086 --> 39:56.524
Royal ball before midnight,
janky decor after.

39:56.568 --> 39:57.960
I saw it on Pintrest.

39:58.004 --> 39:59.745
Cute.

39:59.788 --> 40:02.661
But... the thing is,

40:02.704 --> 40:05.490
I busted my ass
to make this night happen.

40:05.533 --> 40:06.839
Even if it meant

40:06.882 --> 40:07.970
pissing off my sisters,

40:08.014 --> 40:09.450
who are everything to me.

40:09.494 --> 40:12.235
Maggie.
This party was lit.

40:12.279 --> 40:14.237
You'’re gonna make
a great Kappa one day.

40:15.587 --> 40:17.763
Can'’t wait! Yay!
Yay!

40:19.678 --> 40:21.462
Oh, you really committed to
that costume change, huh?

40:21.506 --> 40:24.073
Ew. Oh, Parker!

40:24.117 --> 40:26.206
Baby. Uh, this is the girl
I was telling you about.

40:26.249 --> 40:27.468
Mm.

40:27.512 --> 40:30.210
Parker, meet my
favorite pledge,

40:30.253 --> 40:31.646
Maggie.

40:31.690 --> 40:34.910
Maggie, meet my
boyfriend, Parker.

41:15.211 --> 41:17.126
Harry?

41:21.479 --> 41:23.698
HARRY:
Don'’t let the chains fool you.

41:23.742 --> 41:25.831
This demon will still
do whatever it can

41:25.874 --> 41:27.920
to raise
the Source of All Evil.

41:27.963 --> 41:30.139
Until the Elders arrive,

41:30.183 --> 41:31.663
you must keep it
under constant supervision.

41:31.706 --> 41:32.751
MAGGIE:
Great.

41:32.794 --> 41:36.363
Now we get to babysit a monster.

41:36.406 --> 41:38.234
Just think of it as the puppy
that you'’ve always wanted,

41:38.278 --> 41:39.148
but Mom never allowed.

41:43.370 --> 41:45.067
Or not.
