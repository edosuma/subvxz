Original Air Date on March 12, 2019

00:11.434 --> 00:14.501
I told you every--
everything.

00:14.570 --> 00:17.504
Please. Please, don't
do this. Please.

00:19.275 --> 00:20.552
- Please don't do this, please don't do this.
- Liam.

00:20.576 --> 00:22.176
Shh.

00:22.245 --> 00:25.713
We're gonna talk.
Okay. Okay.

00:28.517 --> 00:32.219
Did you know I spent three years
in a Karelian prison?

00:33.356 --> 00:35.789
It was quite literally
Hell on Earth.

00:35.858 --> 00:38.492
The inmates
were animals,

00:38.561 --> 00:41.061
the guards were worse.

00:41.130 --> 00:42.963
But no matter what
they did to me,

00:43.032 --> 00:44.531
it was nothing

00:44.600 --> 00:46.700
compared
to being separated

00:46.769 --> 00:49.436
from my wife and my son.

00:49.505 --> 00:52.072
Hey.

00:52.141 --> 00:54.708
So I escaped.

00:54.777 --> 01:00.414
I killed
five men to do it.

01:01.984 --> 01:03.917
And when I finally got
ho...I held them,

01:03.986 --> 01:08.122
and I swore that I would
never leave them again.

01:09.725 --> 01:13.060
But then you
and your comrades...

01:14.530 --> 01:24.805
...made me a liar.
It was an accident.

01:24.874 --> 01:26.774
I'm so...

01:26.842 --> 01:29.243
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry...

01:29.312 --> 01:32.246
Shh. It's-it's okay, it's okay.

01:32.315 --> 01:35.449
You don't have
to be sorry, honestly.

01:35.518 --> 01:36.917
We're all sinners.

01:39.021 --> 01:41.855
Anyway...

01:41.924 --> 01:44.024
we will all
be judged in the end.

01:44.093 --> 01:46.860
Please, I'm so s-sorry.

01:46.929 --> 01:50.631
You... sooner than
the rest of us.

01:50.700 --> 01:53.133
Oh, God.

01:53.202 --> 01:54.835
Oh, God. Oh, please, please.

01:54.904 --> 01:56.870
No, please...

01:56.939 --> 01:59.273
But first,

01:59.342 --> 02:02.276
you'll tell me
everything you know

02:02.345 --> 02:05.546
about Hannah Khoury.

02:37.456 --> 02:39.623
Okay, baby girl,
ten seconds. Go.

02:39.691 --> 02:41.391
Uh, under the tables?

02:41.460 --> 02:43.860
Mm-mm. No, you'll be exposed
from all angles.

02:43.929 --> 02:45.428
What is the number one rule?

02:45.497 --> 02:47.364
Stay out of sight.
That's right.

02:47.432 --> 02:49.366
Come on, Naomi, you can do it.

02:53.839 --> 02:54.971
The cabinet

02:55.040 --> 02:57.040
under the hostess desk.
That a girl.

02:57.109 --> 02:59.709
Thank you.

02:59.778 --> 03:01.089
Eh, don't you think our
daughter's a little young

03:01.113 --> 03:02.290
for basic training?
Oh, come on.

03:02.314 --> 03:03.813
She loves it. Thank you.

03:03.882 --> 03:06.416
- Yeah, Dad, I'm a total badass.
- Hey.

03:06.485 --> 03:07.951
Language.

03:08.020 --> 03:10.153
Anyway, she needs to learn
how to protect herself

03:10.222 --> 03:11.788
in a volatile situation.

03:11.857 --> 03:14.057
Or, you know,
learn to play the violin.

03:14.126 --> 03:15.592
Mm, it's never
too early to start.

03:15.661 --> 03:17.127
Anyway, the violin's boring.

03:17.195 --> 03:18.995
- Yeah, Dad. The violin's boring.
- Yeah, Dad.

03:19.064 --> 03:20.897
Okay, I surrender.

03:20.966 --> 03:22.098
<i>Hannah.</i>

03:24.403 --> 03:26.469
<i>Hannah.</i>

03:30.208 --> 03:31.808
Hey.

03:34.046 --> 03:36.646
Victor Zelko was
killed in Yemen.

03:37.749 --> 03:39.683
I coordinated the raid myself.

03:39.751 --> 03:41.284
These photographs are fake.

03:41.353 --> 03:42.497
They've been vetted
and verified.

03:42.521 --> 03:43.753
If that's true,

03:43.822 --> 03:45.822
why would Zelko
expose himself now?

03:45.891 --> 03:47.324
I was hoping you'd tell me.

03:50.262 --> 03:52.062
Liam.

03:52.130 --> 03:54.464
When he found out Zelko's family
was collateral damage,

03:54.533 --> 03:57.634
he became obsessed
with digging up answers.

03:57.703 --> 03:59.969
Maybe he dug too deep,
brought Zelko out of hiding?

04:00.038 --> 04:01.371
I need your phone.

04:06.011 --> 04:07.922
Hey, it's Liam. Please leave...

04:07.946 --> 04:09.612
Still no answer.

04:10.716 --> 04:12.215
The team will do everything

04:12.284 --> 04:14.050
to track Liam down.

04:14.119 --> 04:15.719
Okay. I'll see if, uh,
my Intel sources

04:15.787 --> 04:17.553
can intercept any chatter.

04:17.622 --> 04:19.555
We got this, Hannah.

04:19.624 --> 04:22.492
You should go home
and be with Naomi and Ryan.

04:23.695 --> 04:25.628
And tell them what?

04:25.697 --> 04:27.230
Tell them the truth.

04:27.299 --> 04:30.300
That the man who tried
to kill us is still alive?

04:31.703 --> 04:33.236
I swore this nightmare was over.

04:33.305 --> 04:36.239
Dwayne, I promised them
that we'd be safe.

04:36.308 --> 04:39.476
Now I have to tell them
that I was wrong.

04:43.715 --> 04:45.048
Yes, sir, I will.

04:46.218 --> 04:48.051
That was
Director Vance.

04:48.120 --> 04:51.087
Victor Zelko just popped up
on HQ's radar

04:51.156 --> 04:53.089
within the last 24 hours.

04:53.158 --> 04:55.191
I'm guessing
he was in the Ukraine?

04:55.260 --> 04:56.559
How'd you know?

04:56.628 --> 04:58.261
Because it's also the last place

04:58.363 --> 04:59.829
Liam Somers's
cell phone pinged

04:59.898 --> 05:01.698
- before going off-line.
- So Liam

05:01.767 --> 05:02.944
vanishes just
as Zelko reappears?

05:02.968 --> 05:04.434
That can't be a coincidence.

05:04.503 --> 05:07.070
Sebastian's on with
the American embassy in Kiev.

05:07.139 --> 05:09.739
They've been coordinating
a search for Liam.

05:09.808 --> 05:11.074
We've got to tell Hannah.

05:11.143 --> 05:12.743
No, no. Not until we
know something more.

05:12.811 --> 05:14.344
She's got enough to worry about.

05:14.413 --> 05:16.546
God, I can only
imagine how she feels.

05:16.615 --> 05:18.715
First Norman Wong leaks
the footage from the raid,

05:18.784 --> 05:20.216
now Zelko's back.

05:20.285 --> 05:22.118
Yeah, we've all got skeletons
in our closet.

05:22.187 --> 05:23.731
Yeah, but Hannah's are up
and walking around.

05:23.755 --> 05:24.954
Fortunately for her,

05:25.023 --> 05:27.624
Ukraine is about as far
as it gets from New Orleans.

05:27.692 --> 05:29.759
Yeah, well, not far enough.

05:29.795 --> 05:34.197
Zelko is extremely dangerous
and completely unpredictable.

05:34.266 --> 05:35.598
As long as he's breathing,

05:35.667 --> 05:38.234
he's a threat
to Hannah and her family.

05:38.303 --> 05:40.470
Ukrainian Security Services
found Liam.

05:40.539 --> 05:42.872
His body was discovered
in a rail yard

05:42.941 --> 05:46.643
outside the Darnytskyi
industrial district.

05:46.711 --> 05:48.256
- He was hit by a train?
- If you're asking

05:48.280 --> 05:50.113
SBU, yeah.
They're calling it an accident.

05:51.349 --> 05:52.282
I'm not buying it, King.

05:52.350 --> 05:53.716
No, me, neither.

05:53.785 --> 05:55.930
Sebastian, you and Gregorio
get these photos to the morgue.

05:55.954 --> 05:57.954
I want Loretta's eyes
on them ASAP.

05:58.023 --> 06:00.390
Chris, you and I are gonna
get on the Zelko trail.

06:00.459 --> 06:02.125
Only way to stop him
is to figure out

06:02.194 --> 06:03.893
where he's headed next.

06:25.317 --> 06:26.449
Khoury.

06:26.518 --> 06:28.618
Avner.

06:28.687 --> 06:30.153
Liam...
We need to leave now.

06:30.222 --> 06:31.488
Hey.

06:31.556 --> 06:32.667
Thought it was your day off.

06:32.691 --> 06:34.924
It is. It is. Be right back.

06:34.993 --> 06:36.993
It's all right.

06:37.062 --> 06:38.928
I am with my family.

06:38.997 --> 06:40.463
They have to come, too.

06:40.532 --> 06:42.832
What's going on?
We picked up

06:42.901 --> 06:45.001
some chatter. Zelko's trying
to send a message,

06:45.070 --> 06:46.769
scare us off the investigation.

06:46.838 --> 06:49.506
Our identities are safe,
the whole team is deep cover.

06:49.574 --> 06:50.707
Yours was blown.

06:50.775 --> 06:52.175
He knows
your real name.

06:52.244 --> 06:53.710
He's making a move today.

06:53.778 --> 06:55.445
Oh, my God.

06:55.514 --> 06:56.846
What's going on?

06:56.915 --> 06:58.681
We need to go, now.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.061
What's happening, Mom?
Come on. Come.

07:00.085 --> 07:01.262
We've got transport around back.

07:01.286 --> 07:02.952
Come, come.

07:07.692 --> 07:09.359
Get down. Get down!

07:26.144 --> 07:28.411
- Baby, are you okay? Are you okay?
- No, no.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.046
Are you hurt?

07:35.554 --> 07:37.220
Don't you dare tell me to relax.

07:37.289 --> 07:39.722
You swore this monster was gone.
I thought that he was.

07:39.791 --> 07:41.402
- Are we in danger, Hannah?
- The latest Intel

07:41.426 --> 07:43.526
has Zelko 6,000 miles
away from us.

07:43.595 --> 07:44.661
Then why are you here?

07:44.729 --> 07:46.162
I promised you that I would

07:46.231 --> 07:48.031
never keep anything from you
ever again.

07:48.099 --> 07:49.365
And no matter
what, I'll do

07:49.434 --> 07:51.768
whatever it takes
to keep you and Naomi safe.

07:51.836 --> 07:53.903
- Yeah, I've heard that before.
- Dad!

07:53.972 --> 07:55.772
I can't find
the oven mitts!

07:55.840 --> 07:57.407
Don't you dare tell her.

07:58.476 --> 07:59.876
Mom!

07:59.945 --> 08:00.877
Baby.

08:00.946 --> 08:03.780
Look at my little chef.

08:03.848 --> 08:04.981
I'm baking cookies.

08:05.050 --> 08:06.416
I didn't know
you were coming over.

08:06.484 --> 08:07.717
Mm. Surprise.

08:07.786 --> 08:09.719
You have to wait
for the cookies.

08:09.788 --> 08:11.588
- It's a new recipe.
- Oh?

08:11.656 --> 08:12.833
Double chocolate snickerdoodles.

08:12.857 --> 08:14.390
God, that sounds amazing.

08:14.459 --> 08:15.925
Don't go. They're almost done.

08:15.994 --> 08:17.360
Okay.

08:17.429 --> 08:20.063
We need a contingency plan.

08:21.499 --> 08:23.132
In case something happens.

08:25.370 --> 08:27.937
It's very interesting.

08:28.006 --> 08:30.640
- Interesting good or interesting bad?
- What's the difference?

08:30.709 --> 08:33.876
Liam's injuries
are wildly inconsistent.

08:33.945 --> 08:36.813
But considering the extent
of traumatic fractures

08:36.881 --> 08:39.115
and patterned contusions,

08:39.183 --> 08:42.485
seems he did indeed
get struck by a train.

08:42.587 --> 08:44.287
Okay, so it really was
an accident?

08:44.356 --> 08:45.822
Mm, I didn't say that.

08:45.890 --> 08:47.657
Last time I checked,
locomotives can't

08:47.726 --> 08:50.927
systematically remove
fingernails.

08:50.996 --> 08:54.564
Zelko must've tortured Liam
to get the information.

08:54.633 --> 08:57.800
Yeah, he also inflicted the most
excruciating pain possible.

08:57.869 --> 09:00.109
As if throwing him in front
of a train wasn't bad enough.

09:01.039 --> 09:02.805
This was personal for Zelko,

09:02.874 --> 09:06.009
and meant to send a warning
to anyone else

09:06.077 --> 09:07.677
who may have wronged him.

09:07.746 --> 09:08.945
We need to warn Hannah.

09:12.851 --> 09:14.996
I could call my cousin.
There's-there's always extra bedrooms

09:15.020 --> 09:16.653
in the farmhouse.
Protocol dictates

09:16.721 --> 09:18.032
that we just stay put unless
there's a credible threat.

09:18.056 --> 09:20.023
I don't give a damn
about protocol.

09:20.091 --> 09:21.402
The only thing that matters
is protecting our daughter.

09:21.426 --> 09:23.004
That's why we need
to tell her everything

09:23.028 --> 09:24.538
that's happening.
That's not fair, Hannah.

09:24.562 --> 09:26.295
She's already been
through too much.

09:26.364 --> 09:29.032
She'll get through this.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.100
We all will.

09:30.168 --> 09:32.602
Together.

09:40.578 --> 09:41.844
Mom!

09:41.913 --> 09:44.313
Naomi? Naomi?

09:45.517 --> 09:46.849
What's going on?

09:46.918 --> 09:48.051
What happened? Are you okay?

09:48.119 --> 09:50.787
There's someone in the backyard.

09:50.855 --> 09:52.655
Go. Call 911.

10:17.248 --> 10:19.215
Federal agent.
Hands up.

10:23.722 --> 10:26.522
Avner? What the hell?

10:26.591 --> 10:28.691
It's good to see you,
too, Khoury.

10:38.477 --> 10:40.611
Want to explain why
an Israeli intelligence officer

10:40.680 --> 10:42.780
was sneaking around
a civilian's backyard?

10:42.848 --> 10:44.848
Mossad puts security
above all else,

10:44.917 --> 10:46.784
especially when it involves
a former colleague,

10:46.852 --> 10:48.118
and a friend.

10:48.187 --> 10:50.087
You two worked together?
Joint task force.

10:50.156 --> 10:52.256
NCIS, CIA
and Mossad.

10:52.325 --> 10:54.358
We spent a year investigating
Victor Zelko.

10:54.427 --> 10:56.493
Actually, it was 14 months.

10:56.562 --> 10:58.362
But who's counting, right?

10:58.431 --> 11:00.331
It wasn't just us.

11:00.399 --> 11:03.267
Liam was a valuable asset
to our mission.

11:03.336 --> 11:06.203
Too emotional, perhaps,
which probably got him killed.

11:06.272 --> 11:07.671
You're blaming the victim?

11:07.740 --> 11:09.807
- Just stating a fact.
- How about the fact

11:09.875 --> 11:11.375
that somebody covered up
the killings

11:11.444 --> 11:13.177
of Zelko's wife and son?

11:13.246 --> 11:15.646
So I heard.
That was not our intention.

11:15.715 --> 11:18.482
Our orders were to eliminate
a hostile target.

11:18.551 --> 11:21.385
And you failed.
Zelko's still alive.

11:21.454 --> 11:23.694
But you wouldn't be here
if you didn't already know that.

11:25.258 --> 11:27.992
Our Intel confirms Zelko
was aboard a private plane

11:28.060 --> 11:29.860
that landed in Veracruz
this morning.

11:29.929 --> 11:32.329
That's only a few
hours away from New Orleans.

11:32.398 --> 11:33.575
Yeah,
but Zelko would be

11:33.599 --> 11:35.132
the most hunted fugitive
in the world.

11:35.201 --> 11:36.300
Doesn't matter.

11:38.371 --> 11:40.004
He's coming for me.

11:40.072 --> 11:41.872
Going after the people
he blames for the raid.

11:44.143 --> 11:45.709
Lasalle, Gregorio,

11:45.778 --> 11:47.811
contact FBI and NOPD.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.247
Sebastian and I will comb
through all my old records

11:50.316 --> 11:52.149
on Zelko. We'll look up
his financial records,

11:52.218 --> 11:53.651
we'll contact
known associates.

11:53.719 --> 11:55.819
Hannah, stop.

12:02.428 --> 12:04.428
You cannot work this case.

12:04.497 --> 12:05.929
He's right.

12:05.998 --> 12:08.432
I sacrificed more than
a year of my life

12:08.501 --> 12:10.067
trying to track down Zelko,

12:10.136 --> 12:12.036
and now you want to take him
down without me?

12:12.104 --> 12:14.238
We didn't come here for Zelko.

12:14.307 --> 12:16.273
We came here to protect you
and your family.

12:16.342 --> 12:18.175
I can't just hide,
not like this.

12:18.244 --> 12:20.210
That's exactly
what you're gonna do.

12:20.279 --> 12:22.579
We'll take care of Zelko.

12:24.116 --> 12:26.250
We don't have to play heroes.

12:26.319 --> 12:28.252
Not this time.

12:37.530 --> 12:38.929
There's an armored
car outside,

12:38.998 --> 12:41.131
will take you guys
to Muscat International.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.866
We'll be sitting ducks
in that thing.

12:42.935 --> 12:45.235
Decoy cars will leave
five minutes before.

12:45.304 --> 12:46.581
You'll switch vehicles
halfway through.

12:46.605 --> 12:47.871
You and Naomi
will be safe.

12:47.940 --> 12:49.273
Me and Naomi?
What about Hannah?

12:51.877 --> 12:52.976
Where's your bag?

12:53.045 --> 12:55.579
I don't have one.
What?

12:55.648 --> 12:57.114
Mom...
It's okay, baby.

12:57.183 --> 12:58.482
I have to stay, okay?

12:58.551 --> 13:01.051
It's okay.
Why?

13:01.120 --> 13:02.653
She's crucial
to our investigation.

13:02.722 --> 13:05.155
No, she's crucial
to my family.

13:05.224 --> 13:07.458
Ryan, please, don't
make this hard, okay?

13:07.526 --> 13:08.770
You haven't answered
my question.

13:08.794 --> 13:10.728
Why aren't you
coming with us?

13:10.796 --> 13:12.663
Zelko will come
after me again,

13:12.732 --> 13:14.965
and the only way that
I keep you and Naomi safe

13:15.034 --> 13:16.433
is by putting distance
between us.

13:16.502 --> 13:18.235
Baby, who's gonna
keep you safe?

13:18.304 --> 13:20.304
- That's my job.
- It's okay, baby.

13:20.373 --> 13:21.883
It's okay, baby.
It's just for a little while.

13:21.907 --> 13:23.474
Okay? It's okay.

13:23.542 --> 13:24.775
It's time.

13:24.844 --> 13:26.310
- Come on.
- It's okay.

13:26.379 --> 13:29.346
I'll see you soon,
okay? I promise.

13:30.583 --> 13:33.217
Come on, come on.

13:33.285 --> 13:35.252
Come on, let's go.
Baby...

13:43.863 --> 13:45.262
We're leaving, aren't we?

13:47.066 --> 13:49.333
Guess that means there's
a credible threat again.

13:49.402 --> 13:50.934
I don't want to go.

13:51.003 --> 13:54.171
It's only for a short time.
Okay, sweetheart?

13:54.240 --> 13:57.141
I can't believe this, Hannah.
This is just like the last time.

13:57.209 --> 13:58.675
No. It's different.

13:58.744 --> 14:00.344
I'm coming with you.

14:02.047 --> 14:03.213
Just the three of us?

14:05.684 --> 14:07.562
Avner and his team are gonna
get us a safe house.

14:07.586 --> 14:09.353
They're gonna provide
protection.

14:09.422 --> 14:12.823
Oh, great. Avner and his team.

14:20.065 --> 14:21.298
What about <i>Fortnite?</i>

14:21.367 --> 14:23.567
Sorry, sweetie,
no unsecured electronics.

14:23.636 --> 14:25.113
- Put it in there.
- Street is clear.

14:25.137 --> 14:26.637
We should move out.

14:27.907 --> 14:30.507
I-I need a minute, okay?

14:39.919 --> 14:42.553
I feel like I'm
abandoning you guys.

14:42.621 --> 14:44.501
Focus on Naomi and Ryan,
we can handle the rest.

14:44.557 --> 14:47.024
Yeah, taking down a arms-dealing
psychopath like Zelko,

14:47.092 --> 14:48.225
I mean, what? That's...

14:48.294 --> 14:50.227
like, a piece of cake.

14:50.296 --> 14:52.729
You made a promise to
your family you have to keep.

14:52.798 --> 14:56.834
Let us put an end to this
nightmare once and for all.

15:09.815 --> 15:12.549
We need to find Victor Zelko.

15:15.454 --> 15:17.955
I can't believe that's
only one year of Intel.

15:18.023 --> 15:19.935
Yeah, it's more like a
lifetime's worth. I mean, look,

15:19.959 --> 15:21.636
she's even got what kind
of toothpaste Zelko used.

15:21.660 --> 15:23.427
Can you blame Hannah
for being thorough?

15:23.496 --> 15:26.530
Zelko was selling weapons
to dictators and warlords.

15:26.599 --> 15:29.366
Yeah, and thanks to her, they
found Zelko's compound in Yemen,

15:29.435 --> 15:31.301
and we found these,

15:31.370 --> 15:33.770
three of Zelko's
lesser known aliases.

15:33.839 --> 15:36.318
Yeah, which I used to create a
communications search algorithm.

15:36.342 --> 15:37.608
Just got a hit.

15:37.676 --> 15:38.765
- Nice.
- Let's see.

15:38.766 --> 15:41.745
Dozens of e-mails
from an Anton Caracas,

15:41.814 --> 15:45.649
aka Zelko, to, uh,
one coded recipient.

15:45.718 --> 15:47.162
Looks like
they were discussing

15:47.186 --> 15:48.719
a safe passage out of Veracruz.

15:48.787 --> 15:51.288
Sebastian, we need
the names of every vessel

15:51.357 --> 15:53.457
with upcoming routes
between Veracruz and Louisiana.

15:53.526 --> 15:55.759
Yeah, that's easy,
there's only one of them.

15:55.828 --> 15:57.628
<i>The Simón Junior.</i>

15:57.696 --> 15:59.930
Yeah, it's gonna dock outside
of New Orleans in Houma...

15:59.999 --> 16:02.399
in less than 30 minutes.

16:02.468 --> 16:04.145
Sebastian, find out
who Zelko was e-mailing with.

16:04.169 --> 16:05.489
Chris, you're with me.
Let's move.

16:13.746 --> 16:15.746
Wait here.
Okay.

16:18.250 --> 16:19.550
Must be the off-season.

16:19.585 --> 16:22.486
Yeah, well, that's probably why
they picked this place.

16:22.521 --> 16:25.122
Fewer people
in harm's way.

16:25.190 --> 16:28.325
Mom, is someone gonna
shoot at us again?

16:30.329 --> 16:31.461
We're secure.

16:31.530 --> 16:33.964
Let's go. Follow me.

16:42.241 --> 16:44.508
The hotel is
under renovation.

16:44.577 --> 16:45.754
No guests for
the next six months.

16:45.778 --> 16:47.177
Except us.

16:47.246 --> 16:49.680
There's also running water
and a fully stocked kitchen.

16:49.748 --> 16:52.716
And just in case,
we built a panic room.

16:55.454 --> 16:58.021
We had a limited time,
but we got it done.

16:58.090 --> 17:00.057
The door is
reinforced titanium

17:00.125 --> 17:02.392
with surveillance
and communication.

17:02.461 --> 17:04.227
We worked all night
to outfit it.

17:04.296 --> 17:05.561
Totally awesome.

17:05.631 --> 17:07.564
Yeah, exactly what
I was thinking.

17:07.633 --> 17:09.633
How many, uh, agents
do you have on your team?

17:09.702 --> 17:10.834
Seven.

17:10.903 --> 17:12.547
Strategically positioned
inside the building

17:12.570 --> 17:13.837
and across the grounds.

17:13.906 --> 17:16.807
Zelko won't find us
here, and if he did,

17:16.875 --> 17:19.810
he will be neutralized
before stepping foot inside of the lobby.

17:19.877 --> 17:21.178
You guys will be safe.

17:21.246 --> 17:24.080
We also bought you some clothes

17:24.148 --> 17:25.882
and some personal
effects.

17:30.155 --> 17:31.688
Thank you, Avner.

17:37.630 --> 17:39.997
Okay, well,
I'll take the pullout.

17:40.065 --> 17:41.977
No, no, no, I'll take the couch.
No, it's fine, Ryan.

17:42.001 --> 17:44.167
- I can take the couch.
- No. - Nope.

17:47.406 --> 17:48.905
You and Naomi take the bed.

17:48.974 --> 17:50.340
I insist.

17:58.517 --> 17:59.883
How long are we
staying here?

18:01.954 --> 18:04.955
Not long. Okay, baby?
Okay.

18:05.024 --> 18:08.225
Why don't we go to the kitchen,
hmm? I have a surprise for you.

18:08.293 --> 18:09.393
Okay.
Yeah? Okay.

18:21.707 --> 18:23.206
Let's hope Zelko's inside.

18:23.275 --> 18:24.275
Eyes open.

18:38.023 --> 18:39.289
Three,

18:39.358 --> 18:41.058
two, one.

18:46.565 --> 18:48.832
I got two dead bodies.
It's clear.

18:48.901 --> 18:50.667
I'm coming down.

18:54.907 --> 18:56.339
Zelko?
No Zelko.

18:56.408 --> 18:57.641
Damn it!

18:59.545 --> 19:02.479
This massacre's got his name
written all over it, though.

19:04.383 --> 19:07.751
We need to find him
before he finds Hannah.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.866
ID'd the victims
on the boat.

19:16.935 --> 19:18.701
All four of them had
serious rap sheets:

19:18.770 --> 19:21.237
drug trafficking,
racketeering, smuggling.

19:21.306 --> 19:24.007
Yeah, Zelko chose the right men
to sneak him into Louisiana.

19:24.075 --> 19:25.408
Then he returned
the favor

19:25.477 --> 19:26.743
by killing them all.

19:26.812 --> 19:28.645
He's tying up
loose ends.

19:28.713 --> 19:31.247
He didn't leave any witnesses,
but he did leave a big mess.

19:31.316 --> 19:33.750
Four victims.
Big fight.

19:33.819 --> 19:36.519
Hard to believe Zelko
ambushed all of them by himself

19:36.588 --> 19:38.988
CSU found three sets
of distinct footprints

19:39.057 --> 19:41.991
leading from a dock to an access
road nearby with a fresh set

19:42.060 --> 19:43.827
of tire tracks.
- Well, that means he had

19:43.895 --> 19:46.329
at least two accomplices
with a getaway car.

19:46.398 --> 19:49.165
We've got state-wide BOLOs
issued, but no hits so far.

19:49.234 --> 19:51.935
Well, someone helped Zelko
get into the country

19:52.003 --> 19:54.370
and provided that getaway car.
I want a name.

19:54.439 --> 19:55.772
Shelby Kinsey.

19:55.841 --> 19:59.242
She sent Zelko the e-mails
coordinating his travel.

19:59.311 --> 20:02.679
CEO of ADM Limited-- it's a
local tequila import company--

20:02.747 --> 20:04.781
and is the registered owner
of <i>The Simón Junior.</i>

20:06.284 --> 20:07.884
If Kinsey brought him
get in the country,

20:07.953 --> 20:09.786
she might know what
Zelko's planning next.

20:09.855 --> 20:11.454
Yeah, let's find out.

20:11.523 --> 20:13.189
Good work, Sebastian.

20:15.861 --> 20:18.595
Okay, baby, do we have
any more cookie dough left?

20:20.198 --> 20:21.564
Oops.

20:23.201 --> 20:24.567
Give me that.

20:26.671 --> 20:28.805
Mm.

20:28.874 --> 20:30.240
We should do this more often.

20:30.308 --> 20:31.374
Go on the run?

20:31.443 --> 20:32.542
No, silly.

20:32.611 --> 20:34.577
We should make cookies together.

20:34.646 --> 20:35.646
Hope you made

20:35.714 --> 20:37.313
enough for everyone.

20:37.382 --> 20:38.860
I wouldn't touch that
if I were you.

20:38.884 --> 20:41.050
Unless you want your hair
to look like Albert Einstein.

20:41.119 --> 20:43.219
Point taken.
Yeah.

20:46.958 --> 20:50.560
Hey, Naomi, will you give
Mommy and Daddy a minute? Yosef?

20:50.629 --> 20:52.462
But we're not done yet.

20:53.565 --> 20:55.965
Oh, right.
Grownup talk.

20:56.034 --> 20:57.545
Fine, but I'm taking
the dough with me.

20:57.569 --> 20:59.513
No, no, no, no. That's gonna
make you sick. Put it down.

20:59.537 --> 21:00.770
A little bit won't hurt.

21:00.839 --> 21:02.238
Cookie dough stays, please.

21:11.650 --> 21:13.850
You're a little
hard on her.

21:13.919 --> 21:16.486
Well, one of us has to be.

21:16.554 --> 21:18.321
What's that supposed to mean?

21:18.390 --> 21:20.556
I know you're making up
for lost time.

21:20.592 --> 21:22.492
Look, I know none
of this is ideal.

21:22.560 --> 21:25.461
I'm just trying to make
everything seem... normal.

21:25.530 --> 21:26.930
For all of us.

21:26.998 --> 21:28.531
Normal?

21:30.602 --> 21:33.169
Nothing in the world sounds
better to me than normal.

21:34.606 --> 21:36.706
Truth is, I'm really
struggling with all this.

21:44.582 --> 21:46.883
I never stopped
loving you, Hannah.

21:48.920 --> 21:50.787
I just want to know
why it got so complicated.

21:50.855 --> 21:52.989
It just did.

21:53.058 --> 21:55.858
My job, time differences...

21:55.927 --> 21:57.660
missed phone calls.

21:59.597 --> 22:02.665
We were just living
in two separate worlds.

22:03.902 --> 22:05.835
Not my choice.

22:07.806 --> 22:10.406
I screwed up, okay?
It was an emergency.

22:10.475 --> 22:14.010
There was a lockdown,
it was no messages in or out.

22:14.079 --> 22:15.556
Yeah, well, Naomi doesn't
care about that, does she?

22:15.580 --> 22:17.458
She just knows you said
you'd call and you didn't.

22:17.482 --> 22:19.215
Okay, well, put her on.
Let me explain.

22:19.284 --> 22:20.350
It's 11:00 a.m., Hannah.

22:20.418 --> 22:21.918
She's at school.

22:23.788 --> 22:26.756
It was her first day at school.

22:26.825 --> 22:28.758
I forgot.

22:28.827 --> 22:30.526
Well, did you get
all her supplies?

22:30.595 --> 22:33.696
Yeah, I handled it. Graphing
calculator, notebook, backpack.

22:33.765 --> 22:36.199
Thanks for covering.

22:36.267 --> 22:38.034
It's called parenting.

22:38.103 --> 22:41.037
And it would be a lot easier
if you were here to help.

22:41.106 --> 22:43.706
Yeah, well, I'm doing everything
in my power to make that happen.

22:43.775 --> 22:46.376
Okay? We're so close to Zelko.

22:46.444 --> 22:47.844
You've been saying that
for a year.

22:47.912 --> 22:49.679
Why aren't you responding
to your texts?

22:49.748 --> 22:52.015
S-Sorry, is someone there?
Shh.

22:52.083 --> 22:54.384
Yeah. It's, uh, it's work

22:54.452 --> 22:56.586
Look, I'm sorry, I...
Yeah, okay. Bye.

22:56.654 --> 22:58.588
I'll tell her you called.

23:07.832 --> 23:10.767
Avner, what do you want?

23:12.103 --> 23:14.404
You really need
to check your messages.

23:16.941 --> 23:18.474
We're a go.

23:18.543 --> 23:19.909
In Yemen?

23:19.978 --> 23:22.145
Special ops is prepping now.

23:22.213 --> 23:25.448
Oh, my God.

23:25.517 --> 23:28.451
My Intel on Zelko was good.

23:28.520 --> 23:31.220
Get your bag and let's go get
this son of a bitch.

23:36.461 --> 23:38.828
I never stopped
loving you, either.

23:38.897 --> 23:40.763
Then why'd you wait so long
to tell us

23:40.832 --> 23:42.165
you were in New Orleans?

23:44.903 --> 23:48.237
Things were really complicated
for both of us at that time,

23:48.306 --> 23:50.973
if you remember, Ryan.

23:51.042 --> 23:53.109
That's not an answer.

23:56.147 --> 23:58.014
I'm gonna check on Naomi.

23:58.083 --> 23:59.482
You just, uh,

23:59.551 --> 24:01.031
let me know
when the cookies are done.

24:07.992 --> 24:09.926
<i>Tell us where Zelko is.</i>

24:09.994 --> 24:12.095
Sure thing.

24:12.163 --> 24:14.664
Just as soon as you tell me
who the hell that is.

24:14.732 --> 24:18.034
You'd probably know him
by his alias, Anton Caracas.

24:18.103 --> 24:19.747
I'm sorry to disappoint,
but I'm drawing a blank

24:19.771 --> 24:21.471
at that name, too.

24:21.539 --> 24:24.941
You brought him and his men
into Louisiana on your boat.

24:25.009 --> 24:27.476
The only thing I import
is tequila.

24:27.545 --> 24:30.879
So unless you're in the market
for some top shelf reposado...

24:30.948 --> 24:32.314
Sit down.

24:39.423 --> 24:43.125
This is the forensic accounting
of your finances.

24:43.194 --> 24:44.827
It shows everything.

24:45.930 --> 24:47.529
Including a substantial
wire transfer

24:47.598 --> 24:50.232
into your personal account.

24:50.301 --> 24:52.401
Money came from
an offshore trust

24:52.470 --> 24:55.704
by the name of Anton Caracas.

24:55.773 --> 24:57.706
Still drawing
a blank?

25:00.578 --> 25:02.144
Caracas is one

25:02.213 --> 25:04.713
of my international
tequila distributors.

25:04.815 --> 25:06.148
I may have neglected

25:06.217 --> 25:08.317
to mention some
of my business dealings

25:08.385 --> 25:10.185
to the IRS, so...

25:10.254 --> 25:13.756
you can understand my reluctance
in mentioning him.

25:13.824 --> 25:15.090
You're a liar.

25:15.159 --> 25:17.693
And by harboring Zelko,

25:17.762 --> 25:19.528
you're also
an accomplice to murder.

25:21.065 --> 25:22.264
What are you talking about?

25:22.333 --> 25:24.900
The crew of your ship is dead.

25:24.969 --> 25:28.537
Zelko executed them.

25:31.509 --> 25:33.842
No... They were late
checking in,

25:33.911 --> 25:36.211
but I just thoug...

25:40.985 --> 25:43.051
Killing my men
was not part of the plan.

25:43.120 --> 25:44.520
What was the plan?

25:44.588 --> 25:47.956
My orders were to get Zelko
into Louisiana,

25:48.025 --> 25:49.792
provide him a car

25:49.860 --> 25:53.095
with an address preprogrammed
into the GPS. That is it.

25:53.164 --> 25:54.363
What address?

25:56.867 --> 25:57.867
What address?

25:57.935 --> 26:01.136
Grand Haven Hotel in Gulfport.

26:01.205 --> 26:03.372
Leading him straight to Hannah.

26:05.042 --> 26:08.076
If anything happens to them,
it's on you.

26:08.145 --> 26:10.145
No, no, no. Wait, wait.
You got it all wrong.

26:10.214 --> 26:12.981
I am on your side
here, I swear it.

26:13.050 --> 26:15.317
If you don't believe me,

26:15.386 --> 26:18.554
call Avner Ben Arazi.

26:18.622 --> 26:20.389
He set it all up.

26:24.295 --> 26:25.561
<i>Avner.</i>

26:25.629 --> 26:27.996
You son of a bitch,
you lied to me.

26:28.065 --> 26:31.066
You have ten seconds to convince
me you didn't set my family up.

26:31.135 --> 26:33.902
What are you talking about?
Pride told me about Shelby Kinsey,

26:33.971 --> 26:36.104
and how you led Zelko
straight to us.

26:36.173 --> 26:38.607
No, that's not what I'm doing.
You didn't leak our location?

26:39.710 --> 26:41.076
Yes, I did.

26:41.145 --> 26:43.412
But I'm not helping Zelko.

26:43.480 --> 26:45.013
I'm trying to stop him.

26:45.082 --> 26:48.150
You know what Zelko's weapon
did to my people in Modi'in.

26:48.219 --> 26:50.351
I would do anything
to put him away for good.

26:50.352 --> 26:52.521
Yeah,
even use my family as bait?

26:52.590 --> 26:54.189
Zelko will never
stop hunting you.

26:54.258 --> 26:56.124
He has nothing else
to live for.

26:56.193 --> 26:58.193
This was the only way
to stop him.

26:58.262 --> 27:00.195
I'm gonna take Ryan and Naomi.

27:00.264 --> 27:02.584
We're gonna get the hell out of here.

27:08.372 --> 27:09.538
Get to the panic room.

27:09.607 --> 27:11.473
No. Not without my family.

27:14.545 --> 27:16.378
Yosef, <i>efo ata?</i>

27:16.447 --> 27:18.447
<i>Ma kore?</i> Do you copy?

27:32.763 --> 27:34.863
So nice of you to join us.

27:50.741 --> 27:52.808
Everything's gonna
be okay, baby.

27:52.876 --> 27:55.911
Just stay calm,
look at me.

27:55.980 --> 27:57.846
Okay, look at me.
Never take your eyes off me.

27:57.915 --> 27:59.081
Okay?

28:01.752 --> 28:04.086
You invited me
to this party, Avner.

28:04.154 --> 28:06.121
Here I am.

28:07.424 --> 28:09.524
Don't be angry at Yosef.

28:09.593 --> 28:11.426
Turns out, I pay better.

28:13.597 --> 28:16.198
I will take your guns now.

28:33.951 --> 28:36.018
You must be Naomi.

28:36.086 --> 28:38.166
You leave her alone! She
has nothing to do with this.

28:38.222 --> 28:40.889
She has everything
to do with this.

28:44.094 --> 28:46.328
Hey.

28:46.397 --> 28:48.964
It's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.

28:49.033 --> 28:50.365
Such a pretty little girl.

28:50.434 --> 28:51.800
Victor, please.

28:51.869 --> 28:54.069
What happened to your wife
and your son--

28:54.138 --> 28:56.371
I take full
responsibility.

28:56.440 --> 28:58.140
I had no idea they were there.

28:59.443 --> 29:01.376
It was a
tragic mistake,

29:01.445 --> 29:05.080
but... it's on me.

29:05.149 --> 29:07.149
No, that's not true.

29:07.217 --> 29:09.184
It's not on
you, Khoury.

29:09.253 --> 29:10.852
And it certainly
wasn't a mistake.

29:10.921 --> 29:11.961
What are you doing, Avner?

29:11.989 --> 29:13.922
Telling the truth.

29:13.991 --> 29:16.591
Unexpected.

29:16.660 --> 29:18.026
But I appreciate it.

29:18.095 --> 29:19.428
Continue.

29:19.496 --> 29:22.564
I knew your family
was in Yemen.

29:22.633 --> 29:24.900
I knew they were with you

29:24.968 --> 29:28.203
when I personally approved
the raid on your compound.

29:28.272 --> 29:30.605
And you know what else?

29:30.674 --> 29:34.176
If it meant wiping you
off the face of the planet,

29:34.244 --> 29:35.710
I'd do it again.

29:35.779 --> 29:37.546
Your honesty is refreshing.

29:41.251 --> 29:42.251
Aah!

29:42.286 --> 29:43.452
Run, Naomi!

29:58.669 --> 30:00.068
Drop it, Yosef.

30:15.352 --> 30:16.785
Ooh.
Okay.

30:16.854 --> 30:18.420
Avner.

30:18.489 --> 30:21.156
Hey. Hey, listen to me.
I'll take care of him.

30:21.225 --> 30:22.257
Go save our daughter.

30:27.231 --> 30:29.064
<i>Can't get through</i>
<i>to the safe house.</i>

30:29.133 --> 30:30.065
Nobody's responding.

30:30.134 --> 30:31.633
Mississippi Highway Patrol

30:31.702 --> 30:33.768
had a unit nearby.
They're on their way now.

30:33.837 --> 30:35.971
<i>No idea what they're</i>
<i>walking into.</i>

30:36.039 --> 30:38.073
They'll need backup.
How much further, Sebastian?

30:38.142 --> 30:39.841
Ten minutes out.
Take that right.

31:02.032 --> 31:03.598
Naomi!

31:07.004 --> 31:08.937
Good girl.

31:19.616 --> 31:21.516
Avner led Zelko right to them.

31:21.585 --> 31:24.452
We need to find Hannah
and her family now.

31:27.257 --> 31:28.490
Second floor,
below the sign.

31:28.559 --> 31:29.824
Cover me.

31:38.135 --> 31:40.202
Reloading.
Reloading.

31:41.471 --> 31:43.138
I got this.

31:45.742 --> 31:47.909
Oh, my God,
did you see that?

31:47.978 --> 31:49.744
I can't believe
I hit him from here.

31:49.813 --> 31:51.079
You didn't.

31:52.316 --> 31:54.316
That makes more sense.

31:54.384 --> 31:56.718
All right, spread out,
watch your backs.

32:31.188 --> 32:33.054
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

32:33.123 --> 32:34.689
Thank God
you're here.

32:34.758 --> 32:36.925
Zelko and his men ambushed us.

32:36.994 --> 32:38.360
Where's Hannah and her family?

32:38.428 --> 32:40.729
Upstairs, panic room.

32:40.797 --> 32:42.697
Follow me.

32:45.202 --> 32:47.469
Hey, listen, listen.
Stay here.

32:47.537 --> 32:49.271
Help's on the way.

33:07.491 --> 33:09.791
Pride!
Hannah?

33:09.860 --> 33:12.227
She's downstairs.
She went looking for Naomi.

33:19.636 --> 33:21.636
Naomi?

33:21.705 --> 33:24.239
Naomi.

33:24.308 --> 33:26.441
Naomi?
Naomi, baby?

33:27.978 --> 33:30.145
Naomi, baby.
Oh, my God.

33:31.248 --> 33:32.914
I did what you said,

33:32.983 --> 33:35.450
I found a good hiding spot.
You did good. You did good.

33:37.254 --> 33:40.355
Okay. Okay, come on.
Come on. Come on.

33:40.424 --> 33:43.625
Stay low. Come on,
let's go. Come on. Come on.

34:00.210 --> 34:03.144
Okay, come on, come on. Let's go.

34:03.213 --> 34:05.213
Go, go, go, go, go.
Go, go, go.

34:05.282 --> 34:07.982
Go. Go. Get inside.

34:08.051 --> 34:09.951
Get inside. Stay here.
Don't make a sound.

34:10.020 --> 34:11.420
- Plug your ears. Trust me.
- Mom...

34:11.455 --> 34:13.094
Shh. Don't come out
until I say it's okay.

34:28.138 --> 34:31.239
There's nowhere left
for you to run, Hannah.

34:54.375 --> 34:57.309
I've been thinking about this
for a long time.

34:59.547 --> 35:00.946
Visualizing it.

35:01.015 --> 35:03.349
Seeing all the ways

35:03.417 --> 35:04.583
I'm gonna make you suffer.

35:31.579 --> 35:34.513
You stole everything
from me that day.

35:34.582 --> 35:37.383
My joys,

35:37.451 --> 35:41.020
my reason for living.

35:41.088 --> 35:44.390
It's only fair
I return the favor.

36:19.160 --> 36:21.760
Naomi.

36:21.829 --> 36:25.197
Naomi. Naomi.

36:25.266 --> 36:26.599
- Baby.
- Mom!

36:26.667 --> 36:28.067
You can come out.
Come on.

36:28.135 --> 36:29.902
Come on. Come on.

36:29.971 --> 36:31.570
I need you to close
your eyes, okay?

36:31.639 --> 36:34.573
Close your eyes, okay?
Close your eyes.

37:04.472 --> 37:05.604
Hey.

37:05.673 --> 37:09.108
I didn't think
you will come.

37:09.176 --> 37:12.411
Yeah, well,
it was Pride's idea.

37:12.480 --> 37:16.482
I was completely content
despising you from afar.

37:16.550 --> 37:20.386
Hannah, what I did
was wrong.

37:20.454 --> 37:23.322
But it worked out.
We got Zelko.

37:23.391 --> 37:26.825
It didn't work out.
You lost six men.

37:26.894 --> 37:29.662
Liam was killed.
My family almost died.

37:29.730 --> 37:32.064
And to be clear,
I got Zelko, not you.

37:33.901 --> 37:36.568
Fair enough.

37:36.637 --> 37:38.404
We should be relieved.

37:39.874 --> 37:41.941
You just don't get it, do you?

37:43.878 --> 37:46.445
After everything that
she has been through,

37:46.514 --> 37:48.180
Naomi will never
be the same again.

37:49.650 --> 37:52.117
And that is as much
my fault as it is yours.

37:52.186 --> 37:54.620
But I am gonna spend
every last breath I take

37:54.689 --> 37:57.323
making it up to that
incredible little girl.

37:59.694 --> 38:02.094
And staying away from you.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.467
I hope someday
she could forgive me.

38:12.373 --> 38:14.306
And you can, too.

38:24.218 --> 38:26.618
How is he?
He'll survive.

38:26.687 --> 38:27.853
How about you?

38:27.922 --> 38:30.656
I used to say
I'm tougher than I look,

38:30.725 --> 38:32.558
but I am just not so sure.

38:32.626 --> 38:34.460
Good thing I am.

38:36.230 --> 38:37.162
How's Ryan?

38:37.231 --> 38:39.798
He's recovering, but, you know,

38:39.867 --> 38:41.867
he's not the one
that I'm worried about.

38:41.936 --> 38:45.738
Naomi's gonna be fine. She's
a fighter, just like her mama.

38:45.806 --> 38:48.340
Can I get that in writing?
Yeah.

38:48.409 --> 38:51.043
You know what <i>my</i>
mama used to say--

38:51.112 --> 38:53.879
a parent is
always a parent.

38:53.948 --> 38:57.316
We're always gonna be
worrying about our kids.

38:57.385 --> 38:59.685
But I've learned that if

38:59.754 --> 39:02.154
you give them the right tools,

39:02.223 --> 39:04.356
trust them to use them,

39:04.425 --> 39:06.492
children will grow up
to surprise us

39:06.560 --> 39:08.594
in the most amazing ways.

39:11.432 --> 39:13.732
<i>I wish I could express</i>

39:13.801 --> 39:16.568
what I'm feeling right now,
I just-I just...

39:16.637 --> 39:19.038
I don't have the words.

39:19.106 --> 39:22.708
You saved our daughter.
Nothing else needs to be said.

39:22.777 --> 39:25.511
I want to stop running.

39:25.579 --> 39:27.513
Running from what?

39:27.581 --> 39:29.748
From my past.

39:31.619 --> 39:33.852
From my mistakes.
From...

39:35.689 --> 39:38.457
...every tough conversation.

39:43.364 --> 39:45.064
I didn't tell you
that I was in New Orleans

39:45.132 --> 39:47.066
because I was afraid that...

39:49.470 --> 39:51.403
...Naomi wouldn't
want to see me,

39:51.472 --> 39:54.807
she wouldn't
need me.

39:57.478 --> 39:58.644
Look at me.

40:00.214 --> 40:02.114
Our daughter idolizes you.

40:02.183 --> 40:04.116
She's always gonna
need and want you.

40:04.185 --> 40:05.584
Okay?

40:08.989 --> 40:10.289
Do you?

40:14.328 --> 40:16.728
Let's, uh, let's keep it simple

40:16.797 --> 40:19.932
for now, yeah?
Yeah.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.767
Focus on Naomi.

40:23.337 --> 40:24.636
That's fair enough.

40:27.641 --> 40:29.808
And I want you to know
I'm here now.

40:33.147 --> 40:34.780
For her.
