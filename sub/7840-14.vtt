00:30.817 --> 00:35.047
Nothing like reading a well
plotted mystery on the beach.

00:35.048 --> 00:37.162
It's amazing
how they always solve the crime

00:37.163 --> 00:38.989
just before they run out
of pages.

00:38.990 --> 00:39.851
Marge.

00:42.018 --> 00:44.405
James Patterson!

00:44.406 --> 00:45.706
Come with me, Marge.

00:45.707 --> 00:49.146
Help me think of new
nursery rhyme-themed titles
for my thrillers.

00:51.386 --> 00:54.210
Ooh, how about
"Little Bo Peep"?

00:54.445 --> 00:55.340
That's great.

00:55.344 --> 00:57.221
A clue could
be her sheep.

00:57.323 --> 01:00.568
Marge, the real mystery is
why we're just talking

01:00.571 --> 01:02.929
when I could be kissing your...

01:05.059 --> 01:06.560
I overslept!

01:06.568 --> 01:09.112
The family can't start the day
without me.

01:09.117 --> 01:10.990
Relax, baby.

01:10.996 --> 01:14.281
While you were dreaming of me
and calling me James,

01:14.288 --> 01:16.173
I took care of everything.

01:16.178 --> 01:19.201
Oh, Homie, you woke up early?

01:19.206 --> 01:21.603
Eh, stumbled home at dawn,
same diff.

01:21.607 --> 01:22.571
Now, don't worry.

01:22.576 --> 01:24.652
I packed everyone's
lunches and sent

01:24.655 --> 01:26.481
them off into the world.

01:26.696 --> 01:28.703
What kind of
lunch is this?

01:28.708 --> 01:31.072
A drawing of a sandwich.

01:31.078 --> 01:33.130
I've got Grampa's medication.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.372
Abe, pull over!

01:36.377 --> 01:37.740
You're not the driver!

01:37.747 --> 01:39.242
Shut up, pizzas!

01:39.245 --> 01:40.700
I've gotta deliver you!

01:43.077 --> 01:45.162
Oh... no lunch for me.

01:49.997 --> 01:52.300
Unless I "scare" one up.

01:52.847 --> 01:55.080
Hey, guys, remember
to stick together.

01:55.086 --> 01:57.293
Today is the anniversary

01:57.298 --> 02:00.020
of the Dark Stanley murders.

02:00.025 --> 02:01.262
Tell us all you know.

02:01.267 --> 02:02.013
All right,

02:02.016 --> 02:03.731
imagine I'm holding a flashlight

02:03.738 --> 02:04.950
under my face.

02:05.336 --> 02:07.311
Years ago, Stanley DeGroot

02:07.318 --> 02:09.541
was a cook here at the school.

02:09.846 --> 02:11.490
All the kids made fun of him

02:11.498 --> 02:13.303
because he never graduated

02:13.308 --> 02:14.990
from college.

02:15.216 --> 02:17.853
Stanley, Stanley,
no degree.

02:17.856 --> 02:20.763
Two credits short at MIT.

02:25.477 --> 02:26.430
One day,

02:26.438 --> 02:28.141
Stanley picked up a cleaver

02:28.146 --> 02:30.803
and put a new entrÃ©e
on the menu.

02:40.987 --> 02:43.223
A delectable little dish

02:43.227 --> 02:46.620
called kids' head soup.

02:52.256 --> 02:54.441
Needs more girl.

02:59.275 --> 03:02.030
What happened to Dark Stanley?

03:02.047 --> 03:03.533
They hanged him for murder and

03:03.538 --> 03:05.333
buried him in an unmarked grave.

03:05.336 --> 03:06.872
When they came back
the next day,

03:06.878 --> 03:09.283
the whole cemetery was missing!

03:11.618 --> 03:13.351
Try not to think about it.

03:14.738 --> 03:16.882
They say Dark Stanley makes

03:16.887 --> 03:18.582
your skull into a toilet

03:18.585 --> 03:20.360
and wee-wees into it.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.003
And just when you think
he's done,

03:22.007 --> 03:23.533
Dark Stanley takes your skin

03:23.536 --> 03:25.670
and makes footy pajamas.

03:25.678 --> 03:28.261
Nobody pajamanates my skin.

03:28.367 --> 03:29.870
This is the very spot

03:29.878 --> 03:31.091
where Dark Stanley comes

03:31.098 --> 03:33.693
to harvest heads
for his soup of sorrow.

03:33.718 --> 03:35.463
Why aren't you a-scareded?

03:35.465 --> 03:37.490
Oh, Dark Stanley
would never dare attack

03:37.496 --> 03:39.060
a crowded, well-lit...

03:42.385 --> 03:44.312
Dark Stanley's here.

04:08.887 --> 04:09.940
Whoa!

04:10.387 --> 04:11.710
Murther!

04:11.715 --> 04:13.072
Well, Seymour, I certainly

04:13.078 --> 04:14.201
appreciate you letting me

04:14.205 --> 04:15.872
store my collection of antique

04:15.886 --> 04:17.372
cologne bottles in your office

04:17.375 --> 04:19.209
while they recarpet
my condo.

04:19.214 --> 04:20.401
It's quite a collection

04:20.408 --> 04:22.331
and, I assume, irreplaceable.

04:22.335 --> 04:23.661
You assume correctly.

04:28.705 --> 04:29.312
Seymour,

04:29.647 --> 04:30.193
Gary.

04:34.006 --> 04:35.893
Simpson, I know
you're behind this.

04:35.905 --> 04:37.931
Well, you are going
to get some counseling

04:37.935 --> 04:39.453
from our school
psychologist.

04:39.458 --> 04:42.380
Dark Stanley's going
to eat my brains!

04:42.387 --> 04:44.421
Or from a qualified
professional.

04:44.428 --> 04:47.593
But first... Willie,
get those kids back!

04:48.855 --> 04:51.920
I'll bring those wee ones back
dead or alive.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.021
Not dead.

04:53.156 --> 04:55.463
Ah, ya never let
Willie be Willie.

05:17.908 --> 05:20.073
...Zimmerman, Zorx, and...

05:20.075 --> 05:21.272
Zzyzwiski.

05:21.275 --> 05:23.140
Now back to class, all of you.

05:24.905 --> 05:25.821
All right,
you heard him.

05:25.828 --> 05:26.801
Back to class.

05:26.805 --> 05:28.833
But we don't go
to school.

05:28.835 --> 05:30.680
But you do live
in the district.

05:30.687 --> 05:31.500
That's right.

05:31.508 --> 05:32.980
We home-school 'em.

05:32.988 --> 05:34.771
I teach the big ones and the

05:34.775 --> 05:36.470
big ones teach the little ones,

05:36.476 --> 05:37.730
but no one ever taught me,

05:37.738 --> 05:39.440
which makes the whole thing

05:39.445 --> 05:41.683
just an exercise in futility.

05:41.687 --> 05:42.682
Uh-huh.

05:42.686 --> 05:44.300
Skinner, what is
going on here?

05:44.307 --> 05:46.163
Sir, if we let these hill folk

05:46.168 --> 05:47.582
into our school,
our test scores

05:47.587 --> 05:49.853
would drop so low,
we'd lose all federal funding.

05:49.857 --> 05:51.032
I see...

05:51.038 --> 05:52.493
and we've already lost state,

05:52.496 --> 05:53.992
county, and local funding.

05:53.997 --> 05:56.252
Plus our last bake sale
was a disaster.

05:56.257 --> 05:58.170
People took bites
without buying the cookies.

05:58.175 --> 06:00.220
Yes, we're not very
good at anything.

06:00.226 --> 06:01.480
Excuse me.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.482
Lisa Simpson, with the school paper.

06:03.496 --> 06:04.652
Am I to understand you're

06:04.656 --> 06:06.233
purposely denying education

06:06.235 --> 06:07.240
to these children?

06:07.245 --> 06:07.825
That's a total mis...

06:07.825 --> 06:09.235
Well, I wouldn't, uh....

06:09.235 --> 06:10.436
I mean, that is to say, uh...

06:10.436 --> 06:11.315
Uh, you know...

06:11.315 --> 06:12.402
You see, the thing is...

06:12.415 --> 06:15.163
I warn you, young lady,
we can fumfur all day.

06:15.165 --> 06:15.885
We, um, it's not
that we, um...

06:15.885 --> 06:16.766
You see, what, uh...

06:16.766 --> 06:17.815
I just, we don't, um...
...you're not,

06:17.815 --> 06:18.862
uh, grasping...

06:18.866 --> 06:19.375
We're not really, um...

06:19.375 --> 06:20.242
...the, the, the, the...

06:20.245 --> 06:22.430
You haven't heard the last
of this.

06:23.065 --> 06:25.310
Well, I think we've
heard the last of this.

06:25.315 --> 06:27.090
No, you haven't.

06:27.235 --> 06:28.920
We're going to have
to give this some thought.

06:28.928 --> 06:30.343
Let's sing
while we think.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.032
It'll make it more
fun for everyone.

06:35.577 --> 06:39.140
How do we gag
a blabbermouth like Lisa?

06:39.436 --> 06:43.200
How do we crush her
First Amendment rights?

06:43.304 --> 06:47.211
How do we stop her
writing up what she saw?

06:47.223 --> 06:48.791
Would she
shut her trap

06:48.791 --> 06:50.809
For a gift card
from the Gap?

06:52.579 --> 06:53.731
She might

06:54.567 --> 06:58.861
Oh, how do we stop
a royal pain like Lisa?

06:58.866 --> 07:02.832
How do we make
Miss Righteous

07:02.836 --> 07:07.201
Less uptight?

07:08.235 --> 07:09.853
You have a lovely voice,
sir.

07:10.415 --> 07:12.280
Why do you have to make
everything weird?

07:14.817 --> 07:16.131
MANQUE QUELQUE CHOSE
asked to see me?

07:16.135 --> 07:19.463
Lisa, would you consider
tutoring Cletus' children?

07:19.466 --> 07:20.302
You'll be happy,

07:20.307 --> 07:20.953
they'll be happy,

07:20.957 --> 07:22.250
and I can go home and

07:22.256 --> 07:23.923
enjoy some delicious fondue.

07:23.927 --> 07:25.203
Made with the fondue set

07:25.206 --> 07:26.420
I bought you for Christmas?

07:26.838 --> 07:28.582
No. So what do you say, Lisa?

07:29.107 --> 07:30.892
Me? A tutor?

07:36.316 --> 07:39.272
The hillbilly tykes

07:39.445 --> 07:43.630
Will become by tutees.

07:43.835 --> 07:46.290
Whoa! Ah! Oh!

07:48.286 --> 07:49.213
Hey, kids!

07:49.215 --> 07:52.201
The plow done birthed
a girl-critter!

07:52.456 --> 07:54.170
Young'uns, this here girl

07:54.178 --> 07:57.021
is come from fairyland
to school y'all.

07:57.026 --> 07:58.192
Now, if you need me,

07:58.196 --> 07:59.360
I'll be on the porch

07:59.367 --> 08:01.543
drinkin' Thomsen's Water Seal.

08:01.605 --> 08:03.220
My name's Lisa.

08:03.225 --> 08:04.700
What are your names?

08:04.708 --> 08:05.512
Witney!

08:05.517 --> 08:06.482
Jitney!

08:06.485 --> 08:07.210
Dubya!

08:07.218 --> 08:08.271
Incest!

08:08.275 --> 08:09.602
Crystal Meth!

08:09.606 --> 08:11.223
International Harvester!

08:11.227 --> 08:12.563
Birthday!

08:12.977 --> 08:16.842
Are we gonna do
this much work every day?

08:18.605 --> 08:21.072
Why do I have to go
to a stupid psychiatrist?

08:21.078 --> 08:22.593
I told a scary story.

08:22.597 --> 08:23.312
Big deal.

08:23.318 --> 08:23.971
Look, boy,

08:23.976 --> 08:26.691
nobody knows better than me
that you're a lost cause.

08:26.817 --> 08:28.112
But the school's paying for

08:28.127 --> 08:30.073
five sessions
and there's a Chinese

08:30.076 --> 08:32.452
restaurant next door
where I can get drunk.

08:33.096 --> 08:34.270
Get ready, Sheila.

08:34.277 --> 08:35.660
This guy likes the act.

08:36.635 --> 08:38.970
Mr. Simpson! You good man!

08:38.977 --> 08:40.190
We happy see you!

08:40.196 --> 08:41.493
You not come long time!

08:41.496 --> 08:43.431
Come sit, drinky-drinky.

08:43.438 --> 08:44.270
Where's Margie?

08:44.277 --> 08:45.452
She super lady!

08:47.308 --> 08:49.361
Bart, my name
is Dr. Swanson.

08:49.366 --> 08:50.501
Stop right there, Doc.

08:50.648 --> 08:51.681
This school has sent me

08:51.685 --> 08:53.983
to more therapists
than you've had bad dates.

08:53.988 --> 08:55.380
I've looked at the ink blots.

08:55.387 --> 08:56.813
I've played with the puppets.

08:56.818 --> 08:58.752
The whole racket's
a hatful of crap.

08:59.405 --> 09:00.291
I see.

09:00.367 --> 09:01.910
Well... I get paid whether

09:01.916 --> 09:03.251
you make progress or not.

09:03.258 --> 09:05.490
Why don't we just kill the time
playing videogames?

09:05.496 --> 09:08.272
Yeah, right. I bet you've got
a bunch of "learning" games.

09:08.276 --> 09:09.351
Why don't you go online

09:09.365 --> 09:11.151
and look for a boyfriend
while I take a nap?

09:11.155 --> 09:13.780
Actually, I just got
"Death Kill City II:

09:13.798 --> 09:15.590
Death Kill Stories."

09:15.746 --> 09:18.640
Whoa! You've got "DKC2: DKS"?

09:18.647 --> 09:19.490
That one's rated

09:19.497 --> 09:21.152
"Bad for Everyone."

09:29.927 --> 09:32.243
You have destroyed
all human life on earth.

09:32.258 --> 09:33.702
Level 1 complete.

09:33.718 --> 09:34.490
Yes!

09:37.377 --> 09:38.922
And that's how a presidential

09:38.925 --> 09:40.680
veto gets overridden.

09:40.698 --> 09:41.662
Any questions?

09:41.666 --> 09:43.171
How is any of this gonna

09:43.175 --> 09:45.141
put dog meat on my plate?

09:45.448 --> 09:47.212
Hmm. Maybe the best way

09:47.215 --> 09:48.463
to begin your education

09:48.467 --> 09:50.770
is to get you some exposure
to the wider world.

09:50.775 --> 09:54.630
So, I'm gonna take you
to downtown Springfield!

09:54.795 --> 09:56.720
We gotta get permission
from Daddy.

09:57.225 --> 09:58.753
It's all right with me.

09:59.055 --> 10:00.311
And, lastly...

10:00.318 --> 10:01.193
I need a noun.

10:01.235 --> 10:01.972
Booger.

10:04.248 --> 10:04.800
Read it back!

10:04.806 --> 10:05.400
Read it back!

10:05.407 --> 10:06.690
"The county fair is

10:06.696 --> 10:08.831
always sucky to visit

10:08.837 --> 10:10.750
on a hot summer fart."

10:10.756 --> 10:13.611
"You can eat
delicious cotton hate,

10:13.615 --> 10:15.090
and ride the Ferris burp

10:15.105 --> 10:16.530
and the Merry-go- booger."

10:18.706 --> 10:20.233
You can't make
that stuff up.

10:20.297 --> 10:21.560
What does this tell you, Bart?

10:21.697 --> 10:24.232
That this is one terrible
county fair.

10:24.328 --> 10:25.060
And...?

10:25.417 --> 10:26.023
And...

10:26.176 --> 10:27.950
My dad never takes me

10:27.967 --> 10:29.820
on the merry-go-booger.

10:29.926 --> 10:31.302
He's always passed out

10:31.306 --> 10:32.351
in the parking snot.

10:32.398 --> 10:33.932
He's lying!

10:34.196 --> 10:36.142
You drink too many
scorpion bowl.

10:36.146 --> 10:37.542
You go sleepy-sleepy now!

10:40.436 --> 10:42.083
Did, uh, did you get his wallet?

10:42.166 --> 10:44.431
Every president has a
word balloon that says

10:44.435 --> 10:45.363
"I am gay."

10:51.307 --> 10:53.210
These colorful bums is funny!

10:53.216 --> 10:54.283
And guess what?

10:54.287 --> 10:55.050
Ben and Ken,

10:55.057 --> 10:56.162
the Street Magic Men,

10:56.166 --> 10:57.173
are only the beginning!

10:57.175 --> 10:59.351
The city is a treasure trove
of culture,

10:59.357 --> 11:01.332
and multiculture!

11:05.058 --> 11:08.370
Mistos and lattes
and grandes and ventis

11:08.375 --> 11:11.560
Browsing at bookstores
with fat cognoscentis

11:11.566 --> 11:13.011
Books about Dali,

11:13.017 --> 11:14.833
Degas and Miro

11:14.838 --> 11:18.212
Those are the folks
that you yokels should know

11:21.225 --> 11:24.552
Pretentious laughs
at Bunuel retrospectives

11:24.556 --> 11:27.692
Outsider art made
by mental defectives

11:27.695 --> 11:30.722
Enjoying opry
that ain't grand or ole

11:30.726 --> 11:34.222
Comparing Jim Carrey
to Dario Fo!

11:34.227 --> 11:36.131
Your minds are opening!

11:36.137 --> 11:37.511
Take it home!

11:37.657 --> 11:39.171
Eating tapas

11:39.215 --> 11:40.881
Freestyle rap artists

11:40.886 --> 11:43.750
Mrs. Skinner is Mame

11:45.258 --> 11:48.540
We finally experienced
cultural things

11:48.548 --> 11:51.172
And now they don't seem...

11:51.747 --> 11:55.433
...so lame.

11:58.625 --> 11:59.861
What a number!

12:00.018 --> 12:01.370
You kids got talent!

12:01.535 --> 12:03.162
And I should know.
I used to have it.

12:03.357 --> 12:07.241
Hey! You're one of those funny
people with a big crazy nose.

12:07.406 --> 12:08.622
- A clown?
- No, a...

12:08.778 --> 12:10.731
Joker! That's right!

12:10.926 --> 12:13.642
And I'm not a practicing joker,
so I'm not that offended.

12:14.376 --> 12:16.832
Well it's nice to see
you again, Krusty,

12:16.988 --> 12:19.673
but these kids have
field trip journals to write.

12:19.828 --> 12:21.613
Yeah, yeah, right.
Who's your agent?

12:21.777 --> 12:22.973
What's an agent?

12:23.807 --> 12:24.842
Ka-ching!

12:26.727 --> 12:29.920
Finally, I get a chance
to use these gag contact lenses.

12:30.087 --> 12:33.910
And then I had this dream that my whole
family was just cartoon characters,

12:34.098 --> 12:35.970
and that our success had
led to some crazy

12:36.135 --> 12:38.142
propaganda network called "Fox News."

12:38.635 --> 12:41.090
Bart, I think you're making
a lot of progress,

12:41.285 --> 12:42.633
but our time is up.

12:42.916 --> 12:46.451
- See ya next Wednesday.
- Actually, this was our last session.

12:46.657 --> 12:47.352
Huh?

12:47.598 --> 12:49.110
But we were doing
such good work.

12:49.685 --> 12:52.402
Oh, Bart, I truly
enjoyed our time together,

12:52.557 --> 12:55.190
but the school only
paid for five sessions.

13:00.856 --> 13:02.092
I think I just got dumped.

13:03.045 --> 13:05.443
He used to rob me
two, three times a week.

13:05.607 --> 13:07.841
Now, I'm lucky
if I get it once a month.

13:08.048 --> 13:10.842
He never initiates it.
I have to do all the work.

13:11.027 --> 13:12.231
He just stands there.

13:12.398 --> 13:15.370
Now, now, don't talk
through him; talk to him.

13:16.257 --> 13:19.951
Apu, sometimes when I rob you,
it's like you're not even there.

13:20.195 --> 13:22.230
That is because you're
robbing my brother Sanjay.

13:22.388 --> 13:24.153
- Dude, I didn't know.
- Oh, just shut up!

13:24.696 --> 13:25.421
That's right.

13:25.617 --> 13:28.773
I want to hire your entire
Appalachian dumpling gang,

13:28.985 --> 13:33.772
and I'll pay them the most anyone
on TV is entitled to get: scale!

13:33.937 --> 13:37.652
Now I don't sign nothin' without
pretendin' to read it first.

13:38.278 --> 13:40.050
Hamburger, hamburger,

13:40.285 --> 13:41.982
hamburger, hamburger.

13:42.288 --> 13:42.982
Looks good!

13:43.276 --> 13:46.330
Mr. Spuckler, wait!
Is this really good for your kids?

13:46.517 --> 13:47.891
Teeny, get her out of here!

13:51.055 --> 13:54.111
Okay kids, let's cut some
promos for the affiliates.

13:54.408 --> 13:59.680
You're watching Krusty the Clown
on WPPZ in Vero Beach, Florida,

13:59.845 --> 14:02.372
home of the AccuCurl Surf Report!

14:02.547 --> 14:04.582
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!

14:07.928 --> 14:10.680
Hey, hey, kids.
Have I got a treat for you.

14:10.877 --> 14:14.002
Put your hands together for the
Sharecropper Showstoppers,

14:14.167 --> 14:19.003
The Smashing Bumpkins,
The Spuckler Family Singers!

14:26.917 --> 14:30.761
I have eight teeth
Going on seven teeth

14:30.936 --> 14:34.540
I have a curvy spine

14:34.916 --> 14:38.731
- We live on landfill
- And feast on roadkill

14:38.887 --> 14:42.441
While we all drink Moonshine.

14:45.405 --> 14:47.302
You're better than us!

14:48.657 --> 14:50.390
Look at those dumb hillbillies!

14:50.557 --> 14:52.252
I'll bet they don't even know what...

14:53.338 --> 14:54.403
something is.

14:54.718 --> 14:56.470
Dad, those kids aren't dumb.

14:56.657 --> 15:00.202
This show just perpetuates the
stereotype that all yokels are hicks.

15:01.915 --> 15:03.173
Look at those morons.

15:03.365 --> 15:05.850
They sing because they're stupid.

15:32.497 --> 15:35.900
Kids, it's finally happening.
Your own prime-time special.

15:36.068 --> 15:39.530
The songs will be written
by Broadway's greatest composer:

15:39.806 --> 15:41.870
this guy. What's your
name again, fuzz-face?

15:42.075 --> 15:43.051
Stephen Sondheim.

15:43.288 --> 15:45.982
I know you hear this all the time,
but I think you're great.

15:46.147 --> 15:48.512
And I'm sure you
hear this all the time:

15:48.676 --> 15:51.083
you cost an arm and a leg,
so let's get to work.

15:51.257 --> 15:52.343
Here's the opening number.

15:54.147 --> 15:56.363
Hmm, complex harmonies,

15:56.585 --> 15:57.911
intricate lyrics,

15:58.166 --> 16:00.272
pithy observations on modern life.

16:00.497 --> 16:03.153
What is this junk?!
Where's the zazz?

16:03.338 --> 16:05.992
- Just do what you did in Cats!
- I didn't write Cats.

16:06.145 --> 16:07.141
You didn't?!

16:07.365 --> 16:08.762
Oh, no!

16:09.156 --> 16:10.870
All right, I'll try and save this.

16:12.408 --> 16:14.411
Tell you what.
Just give me a peppy vamp.

16:14.588 --> 16:16.342
Okay. And I can
counterpoint it with...

16:16.508 --> 16:17.543
No counterpoint!

16:17.728 --> 16:18.723
Vamp! Peppy!

16:23.567 --> 16:25.633
Hey! This peppy stuff isn't bad.

16:25.796 --> 16:27.703
Maybe I will right that
jingle for Buzz Cola.

16:29.848 --> 16:33.700
President or ayatollah
Everyone loves new Buzz Cola

16:34.276 --> 16:35.293
With lemon.

16:37.296 --> 16:41.110
Krusty, the Spuckler kids missed
their reading class today.

16:41.415 --> 16:43.593
Yeah? Well, take it up
with their manager.

16:45.757 --> 16:49.413
Cletus, I think you're spending too
much of the kids' earnings on yourself.

16:49.565 --> 16:50.361
That's a lie!

16:50.535 --> 16:53.623
I ain't spent their money
on naught but necessities.

16:53.825 --> 16:56.080
Sir, your solid gold
hound dog is here.

16:59.096 --> 17:01.191
Uh... how do we get
the real dog out?

17:03.288 --> 17:05.880
Do you think I'm telling
people not to have a cow

17:06.038 --> 17:08.851
because deep down
I want them to have a cow?

17:11.704 --> 17:13.662
I saw you yesterday
in the dining room,

17:13.835 --> 17:16.272
and I didn't know if I
should say "hi" or not.

17:22.787 --> 17:23.671
How can I help you?

17:23.958 --> 17:25.953
Dr. Swanson, I'm Bart's mother.

17:26.178 --> 17:29.731
I've been saving this money for my
husband's breast reduction surgery,

17:29.926 --> 17:31.621
but I think this is more important.

17:31.848 --> 17:34.051
Would you please see Bart again?

17:35.706 --> 17:37.290
Of course. Send him in.

17:39.837 --> 17:40.873
Bart, honey,

17:41.215 --> 17:43.672
this is all we can
afford for now.

17:43.907 --> 17:45.123
If it doesn't work,

17:45.285 --> 17:47.753
maybe when you're an adult,
you can pay some lady

17:47.916 --> 17:49.640
to make you happy for an hour.

17:49.838 --> 17:51.962
You know, I'm pretty sure I will.

17:54.696 --> 17:56.503
And I wasn't planned,
so when I came,

17:56.657 --> 17:58.062
my parents had to get married.

17:58.238 --> 18:01.472
And they were too young, and not ready
for a kid to screw up their lives.

18:01.928 --> 18:04.721
Maybe I act out because...

18:04.938 --> 18:06.722
if my parents are mad at me,

18:06.926 --> 18:08.741
they can't fight with each other.

18:10.386 --> 18:14.753
And maybe that's why you do things like
scare your c
