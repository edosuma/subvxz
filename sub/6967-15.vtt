WEBVTT

00:08.108 --> 00:10.167
Relax, they'll be here.

00:10.910 --> 00:13.435
The bank's gonna close in five minutes.

00:13.513 --> 00:15.879
- Sure it wasn't a bogus tip?
- No, it's real.

00:15.949 --> 00:18.918
I've been on this long enough.
I know the difference.

00:18.985 --> 00:22.785
Besides, I can feel it.
I can feel them. I'm inside their heads.

00:22.889 --> 00:25.722
Just as long as you keep yours!

00:27.794 --> 00:30.957
Message received, Agent Scully.
Loud and clear.

00:34.467 --> 00:37.959
Position Five, this is Agent Willis.
Do you copy?

00:54.187 --> 00:56.553
- What, are you nervous?
- Nope.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.923
I just don't want our luck to run out.

01:02.028 --> 01:04.325
Baby, you are my luck.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.524
And no matter what happens,

01:06.599 --> 01:09.033
whenever I look up at the stars,

01:10.003 --> 01:13.097
I know you're gonna be
looking up at the same ones.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.968
The same ones, baby.

01:25.518 --> 01:28.248
You make every day like New Year's Eve!

01:33.560 --> 01:37.257
Come on, people! Get down on the floor,
now! Get down on the floor!

01:38.865 --> 01:42.858
I ain't messin' around here! You! Down
on the floor, now! Now, or you're dead!

01:42.969 --> 01:47.668
Everyone! Down on the floor!
Or I'll execute every one of you! Move!

01:48.675 --> 01:51.735
Move! Put the money in the bag. Now!
Now! Move it!

01:51.845 --> 01:53.938
- Faster!
- Dupre!

01:54.481 --> 01:57.450
Drop the gun! FBI! Drop the gun!

01:57.550 --> 01:59.575
Now!

02:19.172 --> 02:21.231
Clear!

02:24.444 --> 02:27.242
Watch him carefully. 11 minutes, 55 seconds.

02:27.313 --> 02:29.247
Clear!

02:29.315 --> 02:31.306
Come on, Jack.

02:31.417 --> 02:33.817
He's been flatlined for over 12 minutes.

02:33.887 --> 02:37.414
Another amp of epi,
and we'll go again at 360.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.048
Clear!

02:41.294 --> 02:43.592
Still no pulse.

02:43.663 --> 02:46.826
We've done all we can. I'm sorry.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.663
All right, let's call off.

02:48.735 --> 02:53.229
- You want me to pronounce?
- No! You can't give up on him.

02:53.306 --> 02:56.503
- It's been over 13 minutes. He's dead.
- Go up to 400.

02:56.609 --> 02:58.509
We lost him. Let him go.

02:58.611 --> 03:01.273
I'm a doctor! Go up to 400, or I'll do it myself!

03:04.551 --> 03:06.610
Clear!

03:07.954 --> 03:09.319
Still no pulse.

03:09.422 --> 03:13.449
Give him another amp of epi intracardial
and go up to 400 again.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.619
Do it!

03:19.365 --> 03:21.890
Clear!

03:21.968 --> 03:23.128
Again!

03:24.070 --> 03:26.868
- Come on, Jack.
- Clear!

03:28.241 --> 03:30.038
Come on!

03:32.745 --> 03:36.078
We got a rhythm.
Don't ask me how, but he's back!

03:37.283 --> 03:39.877
BP's 80 over 50 and climbing. 90 over 50.

05:35.435 --> 05:38.165
Hello, Mr Goldbaum.
How are we doing tonight?

05:38.237 --> 05:42.435
I'm just going to adjust your drip.
I'll check on you again later.

07:20.973 --> 07:22.372
Any word from Willis?

07:22.475 --> 07:25.569
Still missing. He hasn't
been home or to the office.

07:25.678 --> 07:27.942
I heard something about a mutilation...

07:28.014 --> 07:32.883
Yeah. Three fingers on Dupre's left hand
were severed by surgical shears.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.352
We lifted prints. They're Willis's.

07:35.421 --> 07:38.515
He said he was chasing this guy
for almost a year?

07:38.591 --> 07:41.355
He lived the case.
It was all he ever thought about.

07:42.595 --> 07:43.994
What are you thinking?

07:44.096 --> 07:47.793
That maybe this is some kind
of post-trauma psychosis.

07:47.900 --> 07:51.427
Like the way soldiers sometimes
mutilate the body of a dead enemy.

07:51.537 --> 07:54.529
That still doesn't explain
why he would just vanish.

07:54.607 --> 07:57.337
Dupre's partner... Who was she?

08:00.246 --> 08:02.339
Lula Phillips.

08:02.415 --> 08:07.250
They met while she was serving a 10-year
sentence for manslaughter in Maryland.

08:07.353 --> 08:11.551
- He was a prison guard.
- Until the warden found out their secret.

08:11.624 --> 08:15.390
According to Lula's cellmate,
they carried on quite a torrid romance.

08:15.461 --> 08:18.396
It says here she was released
on May 2nd, 1993.

08:18.464 --> 08:22.662
One week before the first robbery
at Annapolis Savings and Loan.

08:22.802 --> 08:25.635
A 65-year-old female teller
was pistol-whipped.

08:25.738 --> 08:28.229
Died from a massive subdural hemorrhage.

08:28.341 --> 08:31.003
She didn't put the money
in the bag fast enough!

08:31.077 --> 08:34.477
- Lovely couple!
- Well, apparently they took turns.

08:34.580 --> 08:38.174
One pulling ajob,
while the other one drove getaway.

08:38.251 --> 08:43.347
Between the two of them they've killed seven
people and got away with close to $100,000.

08:43.422 --> 08:46.789
That's a lot of money,
now that she doesn't have to split it.

08:46.859 --> 08:51.853
Well, we're putting her face out there.
Local newspapers, America's Most Wanted...

08:51.964 --> 08:54.023
Am I boring you?

08:54.100 --> 08:58.434
- They were married.
- Yeah, last May in Atlantic City. So what?

08:58.504 --> 09:01.701
So I don't think this was a
simple necrophiliac mutilation.

09:01.841 --> 09:06.175
Willis sliced and diced those fingers
to get at the wedding ring.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.795
Anybody here?

09:31.871 --> 09:34.305
Lula?

09:49.055 --> 09:51.114
Baby, baby, baby...

10:05.271 --> 10:07.330
Damn!

10:29.528 --> 10:31.155
It's a leftthumb print.

10:31.263 --> 10:36.462
Look at these two bifurcations here. Whoever
was holding that cleaver used his left hand.

10:36.535 --> 10:39.561
- "Whoever"? It was Willis.
- Willis is right-handed.

10:39.672 --> 10:41.936
I checked his pistol grip at the armory.

10:42.008 --> 10:45.205
But the bank surveillance tapes
show Dupre is left-handed.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.506
I'm not sure where you're going with this.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.310
How long did Willis flatline
before you revived him?

10:50.383 --> 10:52.010
Just over 13 minutes.

10:52.118 --> 10:55.383
This EKG strip recorded
his cardiac activity at the time.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.719
In your medical opinion,
what does that look like?

10:58.824 --> 11:01.190
It could be anything.

11:01.293 --> 11:04.023
Instrument malfunction,
electrical overload...

11:04.130 --> 11:06.291
But what does it look like?

11:08.601 --> 11:10.228
Two heartbeats.

11:10.336 --> 11:14.363
Dupre and Willis went into cardiac arrest
at the exact same time, right?

11:14.440 --> 11:15.907
Right...

11:15.975 --> 11:19.103
For a period of minutes,
both men were technically dead.

11:19.178 --> 11:23.205
- Technically. But we resuscitated Willis.
- You resuscitated his body.

11:23.315 --> 11:24.714
Mulder...

11:24.817 --> 11:27.183
Two men died in that crash room, Scully.

11:27.253 --> 11:29.983
One man came back. The question is,

11:31.524 --> 11:33.389
which one?

11:41.333 --> 11:45.599
What can you tell me about
near-death experiences, Agent Scully?

11:46.405 --> 11:51.069
The usual stuff. The tunnel, the light, people
rising up and viewing their own bodies.

11:51.177 --> 11:53.941
As a scientist,
how do you account for the phenomenon?

11:54.013 --> 11:56.811
Some sort of dissociative
hallucinatory activity.

11:58.017 --> 12:02.784
Half of all the adults who have had a
near-death experience cannot wear a watch.

12:02.855 --> 12:08.657
The increased electrical activity in their
bodies renders the watches inoperable.

12:08.794 --> 12:12.093
I know this sounds kooky,
but, as any biologist will tell you,

12:12.198 --> 12:15.292
when cells die and genetic material
begins to unfold,

12:15.401 --> 12:17.835
a tremendous charge of energy is released.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.599
Doctor Varnes believes this is responsible

12:20.673 --> 12:23.972
for the transformational nature
of the experience.

12:24.043 --> 12:27.240
People do return from the
event profoundly changed.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.304
Changed how?

12:29.415 --> 12:33.818
Personality shifts, perceived
psychic abilities, increased zest for life.

12:33.886 --> 12:36.787
What about the negative consequences?

12:36.856 --> 12:39.450
They're rare. But in the process of dying

12:39.525 --> 12:42.494
there is a time
during which the body is vulnerable.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.654
- I don't understand.
- Well,

12:44.797 --> 12:48.995
there was a pilot in my support group
who died in a commuter plane crash,

12:49.068 --> 12:51.263
along with his three passengers.

12:51.337 --> 12:54.864
This was a few years ago.
Now, he recalls floating up

12:54.940 --> 13:00.139
in a brilliant aura of light, and then feeling
an overwhelming need to return to his body.

13:00.246 --> 13:04.842
He was revived in the ambulance on the way
to the hospital. The only survivor.

13:04.917 --> 13:07.317
Soon after that, the visions started.

13:07.419 --> 13:11.048
Visions of making love to his wife,
in ways that weren't in his memory.

13:11.123 --> 13:16.356
Turns out that one of the dead passengers on
the plane was having an affair with his wife.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.896
The dead passenger's memory, his...

13:18.964 --> 13:22.229
his consciousness,
had survived through the pilot.

13:22.301 --> 13:26.101
- What happened?
- The pilot became increasingly disoriented.

13:26.172 --> 13:28.265
Schizophrenic, his doctor claims.

13:28.340 --> 13:31.434
He strangled his wife
with an extension cord.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.449
That's a nice story!

13:39.952 --> 13:44.389
I don't discount the near-death experience.
It can be explained empirically,

13:44.490 --> 13:48.256
- by stimulation of the temporal lobe.
- I sense a big "but" coming!

13:48.327 --> 13:52.991
I still believe that Jack's disappearance
can be explained in psychological terms.

13:53.098 --> 13:54.531
For instance?

13:54.600 --> 13:58.502
The stress of the case, the trauma
of being shot, Jack's personality...

13:58.571 --> 14:02.667
- How well do you know him?
- We dated. For almost a year.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.107
He was my instructor at the Academy.

14:06.212 --> 14:09.079
The plot thickens!

14:10.416 --> 14:13.283
We even had the same birthday.

14:13.352 --> 14:18.016
We used to celebrate in some dive
in Stafford that had a slanted pool table.

14:18.123 --> 14:20.557
But it was always so hard for Jack to

14:20.626 --> 14:23.322
relax. It was impossible for him, really.

14:23.395 --> 14:27.092
He was always so... intense,
so relentlessly determined.

14:27.166 --> 14:31.967
Do you believe he's predisposed
to this type of psychotic episode?

14:32.037 --> 14:35.370
It's a long way from saying Jack
had a near-death experience

14:35.441 --> 14:39.309
to saying his body's been
inhabited by Warren Dupre.

14:40.346 --> 14:42.814
A long way!

14:46.185 --> 14:47.618
What the hell?!

14:50.589 --> 14:54.116
- You're such a creature of habit, Tommy.
- Who the hell are you?

14:54.193 --> 14:57.321
- Get outta bed.
- I ain't got no clothes on.

14:57.396 --> 15:00.559
Get outta bed!
I don't wanna shoot you lying down.

15:01.166 --> 15:05.364
Who are you - the rent man?
Cos I'm all paid up. I swear. I'm not kiddin'.

15:05.437 --> 15:08.600
- Come on, you can go ask Cosmo.
- Shut up!

15:11.277 --> 15:13.268
- Where is she?
- Where's who?

15:13.379 --> 15:16.815
- Your sister.
- Huh! Lula?

15:17.650 --> 15:22.053
Look, I don't know. I don't know, I swear!
I was just waiting to see her on the news.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.988
What'd I tell you?

15:25.057 --> 15:26.854
Check it out.

15:36.902 --> 15:38.426
The sound's busted.

15:40.072 --> 15:42.472
Looks like they're gonna find her
before you do, pal!

15:42.574 --> 15:46.066
Is that what you think?
It's not what I think.

15:53.852 --> 15:56.286
I miss her, Tommy.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.856
I miss her so bad!

15:58.924 --> 16:01.017
That's why I came back.

16:02.494 --> 16:05.930
- Do I know you from somewhere?
- Everything I see,

16:06.899 --> 16:08.491
I see her.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.000
Jesus, man! You're bleeding.

16:16.508 --> 16:19.602
Even ugliness is beautiful... because of her.

16:23.816 --> 16:27.047
- OK, what are you doing?
- You set us up, Tommy.

16:28.354 --> 16:31.084
You sold us out to the FBI!

16:33.025 --> 16:34.549
Dupre?

16:44.703 --> 16:47.934
Neighbors heard a gunshot,
but nobody checked it out.

16:48.040 --> 16:52.067
Patrol guys responded this morning
to an anonymous 911 and found him here.

16:52.144 --> 16:56.672
Except the rats found him first.
The victim's name was Thomas Phillips.

16:56.782 --> 16:58.875
That's Lula's brother.

16:58.951 --> 17:03.650
There's not a lot of family resemblance left,
between the rats and the.45 in the face!

17:03.756 --> 17:07.487
- Oh, I hate this nicotine stuff.
- What's his story?

17:07.559 --> 17:11.393
Oh, he's single. He's lived here
alone for the past seven months.

17:11.497 --> 17:15.558
A few priors - small stuff, mostly.
B and E, narcotics possession.

17:15.666 --> 17:17.896
Nothing like his big sister.

17:17.970 --> 17:22.599
- Was the TV on when they found him?
- No. Why?

17:23.909 --> 17:27.935
I don't think Tommy was much of a reader,
since he doesn't have any books.

17:28.012 --> 17:32.712
From the position of the body, I'd say maybe
he was watching the tube when he was shot.

17:32.818 --> 17:36.914
- Print kit's over there. Knock yourself out!
- Get out of my way, Ace!

17:36.989 --> 17:40.891
Regulations state, to gain access
to a crime scene, you gotta show ID!

17:40.959 --> 17:43.154
Looks like you were right.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.321
Excuse me.

17:45.397 --> 17:46.921
Jack...

17:52.004 --> 17:54.234
Is there a problem here?

17:54.339 --> 17:57.365
No, I just... I don't have any ID.

17:57.443 --> 18:00.310
Would you tell this gentleman who I am?

18:00.379 --> 18:02.711
Officer, this is Agent Jack Willis.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.841
Violent Crimes Section
of the Washington Bureau.

18:05.951 --> 18:08.010
Come on, let's talk out here.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.520
I was just doing my job, miss!

18:10.589 --> 18:15.185
Willis, what happened?! Half the Bureau's
been looking for you. Where have you been?

18:15.260 --> 18:20.163
I don't know. I just... wasn't myself.
I just kinda... woke up out on the street!

18:20.232 --> 18:23.827
- I'm taking you back to the hospital.
- No way! I'm staying right here!

18:23.936 --> 18:26.234
- You're not ready to be here.
- Who says?!

18:26.338 --> 18:30.866
Jack, you're recovering from a major trauma.
It's a miracle you're even able to walk!

18:30.976 --> 18:34.070
- This is Tommy Phillips' place, right?
- Jack...

18:34.179 --> 18:36.147
Was he killed with a.45?

18:37.483 --> 18:39.576
As a matter of fact, he was.

18:39.651 --> 18:42.211
He was! That's Lula's weapon of choice.

18:42.287 --> 18:47.281
I know these people. I've been after them
for a long time. We're halfway there!

18:49.228 --> 18:53.062
- You did open the book on this one.
- And I'll be there when it's closed!

18:53.165 --> 18:54.826
All right.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.835
But, as a colleague and as a friend,

18:57.903 --> 19:02.169
I recommend you have a full medical
evaluation. Physical and psychological.

19:02.241 --> 19:04.869
All right, fair enough.

19:12.384 --> 19:15.410
Jack! Good to see you back among the living.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.081
- It's good to be back.
- Jack.

19:19.091 --> 19:22.492
- So what have we got here?
- Mulder here found a print on the TV.

19:22.594 --> 19:25.620
A partial oblique. And it's not the victim's.

19:27.599 --> 19:31.126
Good work, Agent Mulder. I'm impressed!

19:44.516 --> 19:46.609
That's fancy shooting.

19:46.685 --> 19:50.052
I gotta get re-certified before
they give me my weapon back.

19:50.122 --> 19:54.889
Well, by the looks of it, I wouldn't
worry about re-certification.

19:58.163 --> 20:02.566
- Is there anything else you wanted?
- Yeah, it's Scully's birthday.

20:03.635 --> 20:05.967
I was wondering if you'd sign that for me.

20:06.071 --> 20:08.471
Sure! Be glad to.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.168
Always glad to celebrate the good times.

20:16.248 --> 20:18.773
There you go!

20:19.651 --> 20:21.448
Happy birthday, Scully.

20:23.789 --> 20:25.381
You're two months early.

20:25.490 --> 20:28.687
It's from Willis. I thought you two
had the same birthday?

20:29.795 --> 20:31.854
- We do.
- Well, that's news to him.

20:31.930 --> 20:35.593
I asked him to sign it.
And he signed it with his left hand.

20:35.701 --> 20:37.134
You tested him.

20:37.202 --> 20:40.694
Yeah. After I found out evidence from
the Phillips murder is missing.

20:40.806 --> 20:44.970
- What evidence?
- The print we lifted. Our best lead is gone.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.535
Someone stole it before the lab
had a chance to take a look at it.

20:50.382 --> 20:55.581
- And you think Willis is responsible?
- I'm not sure Willis is Willis.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.954
Can you at least accept the possibility

20:59.024 --> 21:02.755
that, during his near-death experience,
psychic transference occurred?

21:02.828 --> 21:06.093
Can't you accept the possibility
that this isn't an X-File?!

21:07.366 --> 21:09.357
Aside from the expected level
of post-trauma stress,

21:09.434 --> 21:13.928
Jack passed both of his evaluations -
physical and psychological.

21:14.006 --> 21:18.773
Just because someone forgets a birthday,
it doesn't mean that he's been possessed!

21:18.844 --> 21:22.905
When I was studying for my medical boards,
I forgot my birthday, too!

21:22.981 --> 21:25.142
Did you forget how to sign your name?

21:25.217 --> 21:30.985
This is a copy of the automobile requisition
form Willis filed the day before he was shot.

21:31.056 --> 21:33.149
Compare the signatures.

21:36.828 --> 21:39.388
Like I said, Mulder - stress. All right?

21:39.464 --> 21:42.627
It can significantly affect
someone's cursive standard.

21:43.669 --> 21:46.763
I'm afraid this doesn't prove a thing.

22:20.072 --> 22:22.165
Agent Willis here.

22:25.377 --> 22:27.436
Jack?

22:27.512 --> 22:29.844
- Where are you going?
- We got a break!

22:29.915 --> 22:32.816
- A landlord thinks he's got our girl.
- Hotline?

22:32.884 --> 22:36.650
Yeah. Saw her picture in the post office.
There's the address.

22:36.788 --> 22:39.086
- Jack, can I ask you something?
- Yeah, sure.

22:39.191 --> 22:43.628
The Phillips murder. The print
Mulder lifted off the TV. It's missing.

22:43.695 --> 22:45.822
And?

22:45.897 --> 22:48.457
And you were carrying the evidence back.

22:48.533 --> 22:51.400
Are you implying something, Agent Scully?

22:55.741 --> 23:00.303
I don't know anything about any missing
print. Now, I'm ten minutes away

23:00.412 --> 23:04.348
from closing the biggest case
of my career. Are you coming?

23:07.953 --> 23:10.649
- What's the apartment number again?
- 202.

23:10.756 --> 23:12.849
Oh, yeah.

23:22.667 --> 23:25.033
- What was this guy's name?
- Multrevich.

23:25.103 --> 23:27.264
Multrevich?

23:27.339 --> 23:29.432
All right, all right, all right!

23:29.508 --> 23:32.671
Mr Multrevich, I'm from the FBI. Jack Willis.

23:32.778 --> 23:35.338
- We spoke on the phone, right?
- Oh, yeah.

23:36.782 --> 23:37.908
Have you ever seen this lady?

23:39.451 --> 23:42.477
Yeah. 207. Two days ago.

23:42.554 --> 23:45.045
First and last month - cash.

23:45.123 --> 23:47.751
- Where's 207?
- Down the hallway.

23:47.859 --> 23:50.760
We want you to go back
inside your apartment

23:50.862 --> 23:53.524
and stay away from the windows. Thanks.

23:54.866 --> 23:58.597
Where's our backup?
You said you called them, right?

23:58.703 --> 24:02.764
Should've been here ten minutes ago.
She may be running down a fire escape!

24:02.874 --> 24:05.274
I'm gonna call in again.

24:05.343 --> 24:07.777
Look! That's her!

24:25.997 --> 24:29.330
- Where is she? Where'd she go?!
- I'll check back here.

25:36.601 --> 25:39.263
Face down! Face down!

25:39.371 --> 25:42.033
Hands behind your back!

25:42.107 --> 25:44.200
Now!

25:52.217 --> 25:54.583
She's all yours, Jack.

25:54.653 --> 25:57.451
Yeah... Like a dog on a leash.

26:10.135 --> 26:12.228
I already cuffed her.

26:12.304 --> 26:15.398
They're for you, Scully. Put 'em on.

26:15.473 --> 26:19.068
- What's going on, Jack?
- Put 'em on. Or I'll blow you in half.

26:19.144 --> 26:20.338
Jack...

26:20.445 --> 26:23.107
Shut up! Put 'em on!

26:47.238 --> 26:50.105
Come on, baby.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.268
Come on, get up, baby.

26:53.778 --> 26:55.973
Look at you...

26:56.081 --> 26:58.140
Your face is all dirty.

26:59.317 --> 27:01.945
- Keep your stinking hands off me!
- Baby!

27:02.988 --> 27:05.786
You ain't gonna believe where I've been.

27:14.299 --> 27:18.929
Sure it's crazy. You don't think
I know it's crazy? This isn't my face!

27:19.004 --> 27:21.097
These aren't my hands!

27:21.172 --> 27:24.073
But it's me in here! And I know you.

27:24.142 --> 27:26.736
I know everything about you, baby.

27:26.811 --> 27:29.075
Come on, ask me something.

27:29.147 --> 27:32.583
Your birthday is April 7th.
Your favorite color is red.

27:32.684 --> 27:34.208
Come on...

27:34.319 --> 27:37.345
Come on, ask me something else.
Come on, ask me!

27:38.089 --> 27:41.923
OK... OK, what did we do
after we got married?

27:44.162 --> 27:46.221
Right after?

27:47.832 --> 27:51.598
- After that.
- Well... we went down to the beach.

27:54.005 --> 27:57.907
I took out my buck knife
and I sliced open my palm.

27:59.911 --> 28:01.970
And then I slit open your palm.

28:06.117 --> 28:08.984
And we let the blood drip down in the water.

28:16.161 --> 28:18.959
- Then what did you say to me?
- I said

28:19.864 --> 28:24.028
"This is so we can be married
in all the oceans of the world."

28:31.609 --> 28:33.668
And then I made you a solemn oath.

28:37.449 --> 28:40.384
To never take this ring off my finger.

28:41.986 --> 28:43.476
Ever!

28:45.423 --> 28:48.153
And I mean to keep that promise.

28:52.030 --> 28:54.828
This is... This is just too weird!

28:56.167 --> 28:58.761
I can't believe it's really you!

29:03.074 --> 29:05.167
Don't worry, baby.

29:07.278 --> 29:10.304
It won't make any difference in the dark.

29:14.052 --> 29:17.180
- We'll be in touch.
- When do I get my reward?

29:17.255 --> 29:19.314
We'll call you.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.984
Now I'm worried. 12 hours with no word?

29:23.828 --> 29:28.663
I don't get it. Why's her car still sitting out
front? Why didn't Willis call for backup?

29:28.800 --> 29:31.530
Because it wasn't Willis
who answered the hotline.

29:31.636 --> 29:35.538
- You heard the recording. It was his voice.
- Forget it, Bruskin.

29:35.640 --> 29:39.132
Plus which... the manager
just ID'd him and Scully.

29:40.044 --> 29:42.535
I said, forget it, Bruskin!

29:47.252 --> 29:50.278
This isn't one of your X-File theories, is it?

29:53.057 --> 29:57.426
It doesn't matter what I think.
We're still after the same thing.

30:04.636 --> 30:07.662
- Mulder.
- FBI centrex operator. Please hold.

30:07.772 --> 30:10.502
- Yeah.
- Guess who, Ace.

30:10.575 --> 30:13.135
Willis?!

30:13.244 --> 30:15.644
That depends on who you ask, don't it?

30:16.581 --> 30:17.775
Where's Scully?

30:17.882 --> 30:20.282
You're the FBI!

30:20.351 --> 30:22.546
You figure it out!

30:22.654 --> 30:24.554
Let me talk to her.

30:26.124 --> 30:28.183
Yeah, sure.

30:30.929 --> 30:33.090
- Mulder...
- Dana, are you OK?

30:33.164 --> 30:34.893
- Don't...
- Dana?

30:34.966 --> 30:36.524
OK!

30:36.601 --> 30:39.126
That's it! Goodbye!

30:43.007 --> 30:45.305
It's not gonna work, Jack.

30:45.376 --> 30:47.310
You don't think so?

30:47.378 --> 30:51.109
Bureau policy prohibits
negotiating with kidnappers.

30:51.182 --> 30:53.946
But you already know that, don't you, Jack?

30:54.018 --> 30:56.111
Stop calling me that!

30:56.187 --> 31:00.920
Your name is Jack Willis.
You were born February 23rd, 1957.

31:00.992 --> 31:04.792
- You live at 51 Stanhope...
- My name is Warren James Dupre!

31:04.896 --> 31:09.924
And I was born in Clammouth Falls,
Oregon, in the Year of the Rat!

31:11.302 --> 31:14.203
We spent a weekend up at Pine Barrens.

31:15.173 --> 31:18.734
You taught me how to fish through the ice.

31:20.178 --> 31:23.409
It was your parents' cabin.
Jack, try to remember.

31:25.016 --> 31:27.314
We drove up in a snowstorm.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.444
Come on, Jack!

31:34.759 --> 31:37.353
Don't think I didn't see what you did!

31:37.428 --> 31:41.831
I was like a little slip of paper,
up there on that hospital ceiling.

31:41.933 --> 31:45.130
- I saw everything.
- What did you see?

31:45.203 --> 31:49.196
You left me to die on that table,
while you tried to save your friend!

31:49.274 --> 31:52.402
- You are my friend!
- Too bad he was gone already.

31:53.211 --> 31:57.841
I watched him go. Just saw him slip away
down that long, black tunnel.

31:57.949 --> 32:00.281
No. We brought you back.

32:00.385 --> 32:02.580
You shot me dead!

32:04.989 --> 32:07.048
And then you let me die.

32:08.192 --> 32:10.786
No. You won't kill me, Jack.

32:10.862 --> 32:13.626
You call me that one more time,

32:13.765 --> 32:15.824
and I'll make you stone cold.

32:15.900 --> 32:19.063
Easy, baby. Easy! Not yet.

32:20.038 --> 32:22.165
Remember, she's our ticket.

32:29.981 --> 32:31.608
Hey!

32:34.585 --> 32:38.282
- Got any more of this soda?
- You just drank the last of it.

32:38.389 --> 32:40.220
Soda?

32:40.291 --> 32:42.384
How much of that have you had?

32:42.460 --> 32:46.226
- What's it to you?
- Jack Willis is diabetic.

32:46.297 --> 32:50.893
Which means that you are. Too much sugar
in the system could lead to hyperglycemia.

32:51.002 --> 32:54.096
Maybe that's why
your stomach's hurting so bad.

32:54.205 --> 32:58.733
Abdominal pain is the first sign
of impending diabetic coma.

32:58.843 --> 33:00.902
You need insulin.

33:13.024 --> 33:18.462
I feel myself getting into their heads,
and I'm scared by what I'm feeling.

33:18.529 --> 33:24.229
The intoxicating freedom that comes from
disconnecting action and consequence.

33:24.302 --> 33:28.932
Theirs is a world where
nothing matters but their own needs,

33:29.841 --> 33:32.139
their own impossible appetites.

33:32.944 --> 33:37.745
And while the pleasure they derive
from acts of violence is clearly sexual,

33:37.849 --> 33:43.549
it also speaks to what Warden Jackson
called their "operatic devotion to each other".

33:43.654 --> 33:46.054
It's a love affair... I almost envy.

33:53.798 --> 33:57.461
Cadenceville PD just reported
a drugstore was broken into here,

33:57.535 --> 34:00.003
on the corner of
Old Forge Road and Madison.

34:00.104 --> 34:04.165
I'm betting that Scully is somewhere
within this five-mile radius.

34:04.275 --> 34:09.110
- Am I missing something?!
- 200 units of NPH insulin were taken.

34:09.179 --> 34:11.273
Willis is diabetic.

34:11.349 --> 34:16.786
Get me a census report. Let's see
how many households we're talking about.

34:19.991 --> 34:23.427
Quick, quick, quick!
My legs are starting to go numb!

34:23.527 --> 34:24.722
Hold on...

34:27.532 --> 34:30.092
- What the hell?
- Drop the needle.

34:31.002 --> 34:34.402
- Without this medicine, he dies.
- Yeah! So you said.

34:35.639 --> 34:37.766
Now... put it down.

34:37.842 --> 34:40.572
Unless you want me
to put you down with it.

34:42.980 --> 34:45.505
What the hell are you doing?

34:46.784 --> 34:49.547
I need that medicine!

34:50.922 --> 34:54.551
- You still haven't figured it out, have you?
- Figured what out?

34:54.625 --> 34:56.786
It wasn't my brother who set you up!

35:00.264 --> 35:02.357
You?!

35:02.433 --> 35:04.526
Yeah... Me.

35:08.172 --> 35:10.037
How do you think I got away so clean?

35:10.141 --> 35:13.372
The minute you stepped into that bank,
I was out of there.

35:13.444 --> 35:15.571
I got the money and I got rid of you!

35:15.646 --> 35:17.773
At least, I thought I did.

35:30.495 --> 35:32.588
Tactical room. This is it!

35:35.233 --> 35:36.962
Mulder.

35:37.034 --> 35:39.764
- Listen carefully.
- Where's Willis?

35:39.837 --> 35:42.965
- Oh, he's here somewhere.
- Let me talk to Scully.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.974
Not this time.

35:45.042 --> 35:47.909
We don't deal unless we know Scully's alive.

35:48.012 --> 35:50.071
She's alive.

35:50.181 --> 35:52.274
She's not happy, but... she's alive.

35:53.584 --> 35:57.486
You listen to me. You lay one hand
on Scully, and so help me God...

35:57.588 --> 36:02.218
If I were you, I'd stop talking
and start passing around the collection hat.

36:02.293 --> 36:06.787
Cos if you ever wanna see Scully again,
it's gonna cost you a million dollars.

36:06.864 --> 36:10.630
Have it by this time tomorrow.
I'll tell you when and where.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.630
We got it. It's a 202 number.

36:14.872 --> 36:16.931
- Great!
- It's coming through.

36:19.143 --> 36:21.236
- Here it is.
- Get the address.

36:22.046 --> 36:24.105
- Forget it.
- Why?

36:25.483 --> 36:27.542
It's Scully's cellular number.

36:27.652 --> 36:30.086
They're using her phone. We can't trace them.

36:39.964 --> 36:42.728
She's not happy, but... she's alive.

36:42.833 --> 36:47.270
If I were you, I'd stop talking
and start passing around the collection hat.

36:47.338 --> 36:50.364
- That last part?
- Yeah. Squelch the voice even more.

36:50.474 --> 36:51.736
Yeah.

36:54.445 --> 36:55.275
Done.

36:56.247 --> 37:00.547
If I were you, I'd stop talking
and start passing around the collection hat.

37:02.086 --> 37:04.111
Yep. Yep! There's something there.

37:04.188 --> 37:06.656
Definitely something at the high end.

37:07.491 --> 37:12.793
Let me throw on an extra Z-14 filter...
and isolate everything over half a decibel.

37:14.465 --> 37:18.799
If I were you, I'd stop talking
and start passing around the collection hat.

37:18.903 --> 37:21.269
There. That engine sound.

37:21.339 --> 37:23.773
Let's clean it up some more!

37:30.014 --> 37:34.007
If I were you, I'd stop talking and...

37:34.118 --> 37:36.382
Is that a small plane?

37:37.555 --> 37:39.614
Taking off, by the sound of it.

37:39.757 --> 37:42.749
Give me a minute to guess
the altitude within 200ft!

37:42.827 --> 37:44.920
Great!

37:47.932 --> 37:52.392
All right, people! Settle down, grab a seat.
Mulder says he's got something.

37:52.503 --> 37:56.769
What? An alien virus, or new information
on the Kennedy assassination?

37:56.841 --> 37:58.934
Hey, Mulder's all right.

37:59.010 --> 38:03.174
Pay attention,
you might learn something from the man.

38:05.616 --> 38:10.144
From our last phone contact, we've identified
what sounds like light aircraft.

38:10.221 --> 38:15.318
Now, Washington County Regional Airport
happens to fall within our area.

38:15.393 --> 38:17.520
Since takeoffs are north to south,

38:17.595 --> 38:21.258
it's a fair bet that our target area
lies along this flight path.

38:22.266 --> 38:27.363
For those who remember math, that gives us
an area of three square miles to cover.

38:27.438 --> 38:29.872
Roughly 1,000 households.

38:29.974 --> 38:32.534
With 100 law enforcement officials,

38:32.610 --> 38:38.480
at about 30 households per man per hour,
we can canvass the entire area in three hours.

38:38.582 --> 38:42.074
Bruskin will grid the target area
and divide it among the teams.

38:42.186 --> 38:46.088
For those of you... who don't know
already, this one's important to me.

38:46.190 --> 38:49.216
So... let's do it right. Thanks.

38:52.063 --> 38:55.692
Let me see Steinberg, Calder, Westin,
Stipley and Mackowitz...

39:00.604 --> 39:02.697
Scully?

39:05.242 --> 39:07.369
Was there snow?

39:10.247 --> 39:12.306
Yes... Jack.

39:12.416 --> 39:14.907
There was lots of snow.

39:16.787 --> 39:19.847
- I can't...
- It was December.

39:19.924 --> 39:22.415
It was the weekend after Thanksgiving.

39:24.729 --> 39:26.822
I remember...

39:27.498 --> 39:29.591
a red stove.

39:30.401 --> 39:32.460
Yeah... That's right.

39:32.536 --> 39:37.405
There was a... There was a wood-burning
stove right in the middle of the room.

39:38.342 --> 39:40.071
Cold?

39:40.945 --> 39:43.038
- Yeah.
- So cold...

39:44.115 --> 39:47.881
I remember... I had to wrap you in a blanket

39:47.952 --> 39:50.546
when the wood ran out.

39:50.654 --> 39:52.451
Yeah.

39:55.426 --> 39:58.953
No... Jack! Don't close your eyes.

39:59.063 --> 40:01.827
Come on, keep talking.

40:01.899 --> 40:03.764
Jack, keep talking! Come on!

40:03.868 --> 40:06.530
Down on the floor, now!
Now, or you're dead!

40:06.637 --> 40:09.105
- I'm gonna execute every one of you!
- No!

40:09.874 --> 40:11.102
No!

40:12.643 --> 40:15.737
Shut up and do it!

40:27.558 --> 40:31.085
Just a second! Who is it?

40:31.162 --> 40:34.859
It's Brother Tate. Could I speak with
you for just one moment, please?

40:36.400 --> 40:38.368
What do you want?

40:38.469 --> 40:42.565
Just a few minutes of your time, ma'am.
Beautiful day, isn't it?

40:42.673 --> 40:45.574
I wonder if I can interest you
in the word of the Lord?

40:45.676 --> 40:49.203
- Leather-bound, in black or red. Your choice.
- Go away!

40:54.785 --> 40:56.878
This is One Four. Target sighted.

41:05.763 --> 41:09.028
Well... I guess it's time to make that call.

41:10.534 --> 41:13.162
He's dead.

41:14.138 --> 41:16.197
It's all on you now.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.366
He's dead because of you.

41:24.048 --> 41:26.141
Well...

41:26.217 --> 41:27.809
Guess it's over.

41:28.919 --> 41:31.911
Whoever you are.

41:33.624 --> 41:35.819
Don't move!

41:35.926 --> 41:37.985
- Jack!
- Shut up!

41:38.863 --> 41:41.024
I love you.

41:41.131 --> 41:42.598
Don't you know?

41:42.733 --> 41:45.531
You're why I came back.

41:52.943 --> 41:55.002
This is Westin.

41:55.079 --> 41:59.948
They've battened down the hatches. No clear
shot from this side. What about you guys?

42:01.485 --> 42:04.784
Ditto. Hold your positions
and keep radios at two.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.801
- How do we look?
- Backup's in.

42:26.877 --> 42:30.074
- But we still don't know what's going on.
- We will soon enough.

42:30.281 --> 42:33.876
I kept a bottle of medicine
in the other room. I'll go get it.

42:33.984 --> 42:36.043
What do you say, huh?

42:36.720 --> 42:38.813
I'll get it for you.

42:38.889 --> 42:40.982
Look! Look! Look!

42:41.058 --> 42:43.117
Look, I love you.

42:43.227 --> 42:45.286
- I love you, baby.
- No...

42:45.396 --> 42:48.024
Listen! Listen, we... we still have her.

42:48.699 --> 42:50.792
We can get away with this.

42:50.868 --> 42:53.598
I don't think so, baby. Not this time.

42:53.704 --> 42:55.501
Jack, put the gun down!

42:55.606 --> 42:59.508
You remember that... that
light that I talked about?

42:59.610 --> 43:02.135
- No...
- It's beautiful.

43:04.315 --> 43:06.408
There's nothing to be afraid of.

43:07.718 --> 43:09.652
- No!
- FBI!

43:09.753 --> 43:11.015
Freeze!

43:11.088 --> 43:13.022
Jack!

43:13.090 --> 43:14.717
FBI!

43:19.663 --> 43:21.756
Scully. Are you OK?

43:23.033 --> 43:25.092
Jack?!

43:43.153 --> 43:47.852
Hi. I got this from the morgue,
along with the rest of his personal effects.

43:47.925 --> 43:50.086
I thought you might want it.

43:51.195 --> 43:53.288
"Happy 35th. Love D."

43:54.465 --> 43:56.899
I got it for him three years ago.

43:58.002 --> 44:00.061
Next of kin?

44:01.171 --> 44:02.365
No.

44:02.473 --> 44:05.874
Jack was an only child.
His parents died when he was in college.

44:05.943 --> 44:09.140
There's a... kid over in Parklawn.

44:09.213 --> 44:13.582
Jack's been his big brother,
so I'm going to go and see him tomorrow.

44:14.785 --> 44:18.312
- What am I gonna tell him?
- The official story.

44:18.389 --> 44:20.482
Which is?

44:20.557 --> 44:23.958
Fugitive Lula Phillips died in
a shoot-out with federal agents.

44:24.028 --> 44:28.522
It also resulted in the death of Special Agent
Jack Willis - killed in the line of duty.

44:34.772 --> 44:37.764
What am I supposed to tell myself?

44:41.145 --> 44:42.976
Good night.

44:45.516 --> 44:48.383
It's not working. It stopped.

44:51.388 --> 44:53.379
At 6:47.

44:53.457 --> 44:57.450
The exact time that Jack
went into cardiac arrest at the hospital.

44:57.561 --> 44:59.392
What does that mean?

44:59.463 --> 45:01.556
It means...

45:03.934 --> 45:06.334
It means whatever you want it to mean.

45:08.472 --> 45:10.565
Good night.
