WEBVTT

00:18.801 --> 00:20.281
-Oh!
-Seven in a row!

00:20.324 --> 00:21.369
That's seven for Kevin!

00:21.412 --> 00:23.501
We're in Seventh Kevin,
baby!

00:23.545 --> 00:25.460
Hey, one more
and that's a sweep, son,

00:25.503 --> 00:27.897
and that means a naked lap
for you, Neil!

00:27.940 --> 00:30.073
God, not again.

00:30.117 --> 00:31.944
Patty, what do you care?
You're my sister.

00:31.988 --> 00:33.729
You used to change
my diapers.

00:33.772 --> 00:36.688
Which is weird 'cause you're
three years older than me.

00:38.168 --> 00:39.300
-Come on.
-Alright. Watch this.

00:39.343 --> 00:40.301
Here we go.
Kevin.

00:40.344 --> 00:41.302
Larry Bird!

00:41.345 --> 00:42.781
Aah!

00:42.825 --> 00:46.089
I mean, sorry, Mom.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.744
Neil, what is
our one house rule?

00:48.787 --> 00:50.789
Yankees suck.

00:50.833 --> 00:53.966
No.
Don't call me Mom.

00:54.010 --> 00:57.100
And, yes, of course,
Yankees suck.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.580
Well, this looks fun.

00:58.623 --> 01:00.321
This is practice.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.149
Can't lose
the beer pong tournament

01:02.192 --> 01:04.194
at our anniversary party.

01:04.238 --> 01:06.414
Okay, yes, well,
about the party.

01:06.457 --> 01:07.589
Oh.

01:07.632 --> 01:09.895
Man.
No!

01:11.854 --> 01:13.943
That maybe,
instead of a rager,

01:13.986 --> 01:15.945
we could celebrate
our 10th anniversary

01:15.988 --> 01:18.643
with something
more...adult.

01:18.687 --> 01:20.993
-Like a threesome?
-Like a threesome?

01:21.037 --> 01:23.039
Um, no.
No.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.824
Like, maybe a-a grown-up
dinner together.

01:25.868 --> 01:28.044
I mean, we are 35.

01:28.088 --> 01:31.700
Yeah, but you're lady 35
and I'm boy 35.

01:31.743 --> 01:33.049
What's the difference?

01:33.093 --> 01:35.486
Well, I'm just hitting
my prime, and you --

01:35.530 --> 01:37.706
Hmm?

01:37.749 --> 01:39.925
...are, too.

01:39.969 --> 01:43.625
Very quick.
I think she bought it.

01:43.668 --> 01:44.930
Come on.

01:44.974 --> 01:46.889
You love
the Anniversa-rager.

01:46.932 --> 01:49.065
You always say,
"I don't want one!"

01:49.109 --> 01:51.763
But I know you have
the best time

01:51.807 --> 01:54.201
putting it together
and --
Oh!

01:54.244 --> 01:56.638
I do love
a planning phase.

01:56.681 --> 01:58.118
That's my girl.

01:58.161 --> 02:01.599
Nothing says "party"
like your flowcharts.

02:01.643 --> 02:03.079
Alright.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.036
Let's get this all cleared up,
okay?

02:04.080 --> 02:05.212
'Cause dinner's
almost ready.

02:05.255 --> 02:06.996
-Oh, come on!
-I'm up next!

02:07.039 --> 02:08.998
No, see, this is why
I call you "Mom."

02:09.041 --> 02:11.261
Guys,
leave her alone, alright?

02:11.305 --> 02:13.350
Someone has to be responsible.
Right?

02:13.394 --> 02:15.178
Thank you.

02:15.222 --> 02:18.094
Okay, babe, how about this --
how about next year,

02:18.138 --> 02:21.097
we will celebrate
our anniversary your way, 'kay?

02:21.141 --> 02:22.664
Okay.
Yoink.

02:22.707 --> 02:25.623
Game on!

02:25.667 --> 02:28.235
Game over!
It's naked lap time, Neil!

02:28.278 --> 02:29.410
-Hey, babe.
-Yes?

02:29.453 --> 02:30.454
Can you grab us
freshies?

02:30.498 --> 02:31.629
Oh!

02:31.673 --> 02:33.631
Allison,
avert your eyes.

02:33.675 --> 02:35.459
I can't have you
leaving Kevin for me.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.964
I'm fine!

04:13.122 --> 04:14.993
Ugh.

04:16.865 --> 04:19.041
Okay.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.570
I just stepped on
a very large roach.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.746
Aw, no.
Did you kill it?

04:28.790 --> 04:32.968
Worcester Harvest Fair has
a contest for biggest vermin.

04:33.011 --> 04:35.013
'Course we do.

04:35.057 --> 04:37.407
Next time, just, uh,
sweep 'im into your shoe.

04:37.451 --> 04:40.758
It was bigger
than my shoe.

04:40.802 --> 04:44.588
God.
I hope he had babies.

04:44.632 --> 04:46.895
Uh, what have I said
about green stuff?

04:46.938 --> 04:48.113
It's garnish.

04:48.157 --> 04:50.377
On scrambled eggs
and hot dogs?

04:50.420 --> 04:51.769
Yes.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.380
Uh.
Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom.

04:53.423 --> 04:55.033
Yum.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.474
Ke-- Mm.
Kevin, when I bought you

05:00.517 --> 05:03.433
those Curt Schilling coasters,
you promised you'd use them.

05:03.477 --> 05:06.175
This coffee table's
from Pottery Barn.

05:06.218 --> 05:09.004
Pottery Barn from Goodwill
is just Goodwill.

05:09.047 --> 05:12.268
It's like getting lobster
from McDonald's.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.052
It's the nicest thing
we have in this house.

05:14.096 --> 05:18.013
Uh, I think you're forgetting
about my Wade Boggs rookie card.

05:18.056 --> 05:20.363
No, I'm not.

05:20.407 --> 05:23.192
Hey. We've been here
for 10 years now.

05:23.235 --> 05:24.628
Don't you think it's time
we take some of the money

05:24.672 --> 05:26.630
we've saved
and invest in our future?

05:26.674 --> 05:29.981
Wade Boggs
only appreciates.

05:30.025 --> 05:32.636
You never get that feeling that
maybe change wouldn't be so --

05:32.680 --> 05:34.377
Nope.

05:34.421 --> 05:35.857
Well, look at the time.

05:35.900 --> 05:39.687
You really should get --
really should get going.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.341
Aw. Man.

05:41.384 --> 05:43.299
Can't we switch places
for the day?

05:43.343 --> 05:44.909
How'd that work?

05:44.953 --> 05:48.478
Well, uh, you can wear
a fat suit and install cable,

05:48.522 --> 05:50.480
and I can work
at the happiest place on Earth.

05:50.524 --> 05:54.310
-It's a liquor store.
-I know what I said.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.094
It's no fair that you get
to work there

05:56.138 --> 05:57.792
while I have to watch
my snobby boss

05:57.835 --> 06:01.012
give the fiber optic job
to Brenda.
To Brenda.

06:01.056 --> 06:02.231
That job was mine.

06:02.274 --> 06:04.276
-Well, it pays the same.
-Psh.

06:04.320 --> 06:08.106
You can't put a price
on prestige.

06:08.150 --> 06:10.587
Tell that
to Pottery Barn.

06:12.981 --> 06:15.679
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go run
some errands before work.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.507
Oh.
Uh, hey, if you're looking

06:17.551 --> 06:20.075
for an anniversary gift idea
for me,

06:20.118 --> 06:23.818
they make alcoholic snow cones
now, so, just an idea.

06:23.861 --> 06:26.342
I saw the note you left
on the bathroom mirror.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.823
You know that's
permanent marker, right?

06:28.866 --> 06:32.348
Well, that's 'cause
it's a permanent reminder.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.569
And I'm sure you're
wondering what I'm gonna
get you for the occasion,

06:35.612 --> 06:38.702
so tell Neil what to get
-and he'll tell me.
-Tell Neil what to get
and he'll tell you.

06:38.746 --> 06:39.747
Okay.

06:39.790 --> 06:40.922
Love you.

06:41.792 --> 06:42.706

09:37.054 --> 09:38.490
Well,
a new listing came in.

09:38.534 --> 09:40.536
I thought of you
the minute I saw it.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.146
What?

09:42.190 --> 09:43.844
Sellers are motivated,
it's within the gates,

09:43.887 --> 09:46.716
but on the smaller side,
and you only need 5% down.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.152
Wow.

09:48.196 --> 09:51.068
That's, like, all our savings.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.461
10 years' worth
just for a down payment?

09:52.504 --> 09:53.897
I don't think I could --Eh.

09:53.941 --> 09:56.160
Math is workable.

09:56.204 --> 09:57.466
Math is workable?

09:57.509 --> 09:59.207
Come on in,
we'll do some crunching.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.904
I'll take your coat.

10:00.948 --> 10:03.124
Come on.
Here.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.039
Um, let me, um --Just a sec.

10:05.082 --> 10:06.040
Sorry.
Oh!

10:06.083 --> 10:07.694
God, what the hell?

10:07.737 --> 10:09.521
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

10:09.565 --> 10:11.480
Oh, no.
I just bit my tongue.

10:11.523 --> 10:12.873
Can I --
No, no.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.570
Just come in,
and we can discuss the --

10:14.614 --> 10:15.919
You know what?
It's -- It's fine.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.965
'Cause I don't think
this actually would really make

10:18.008 --> 10:20.054
a lot of sense for us
right now.

10:20.097 --> 10:21.446
Mm. Yeah.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.710
But you should
really ice that.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.949
Hi.
Excuse me.

10:45.993 --> 10:47.734
Hi.
Hi.

10:47.777 --> 10:50.388
Um, could you tell me
what shade of red is right?

10:50.432 --> 10:52.173
I-It's my anniversary
coming up,

10:52.216 --> 10:55.176
and I've always loved kind of
the classic red lip, you know?

10:55.219 --> 10:57.091
But when I try,
I always choose

10:57.134 --> 10:59.746
the wrong shade of red
and end up looking trashy.

10:59.789 --> 11:02.052
With you?
Impossible.

11:02.096 --> 11:03.750
Come on.
No, no.

11:03.793 --> 11:05.229
I think whatever you're
wearing now is perfect.

11:05.273 --> 11:06.709
I totally agree.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.493
This whole look
really works for you.

11:08.537 --> 11:09.930
Yeah.

11:09.973 --> 11:12.889
Well, it's just
tinted ChapStick.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.723
Well, you coulda told me.

11:32.126 --> 11:35.738
And a Powah Ball quick pick,
bonus numbah 11 for Edelman.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.609
And, uh, throw in a couple
of the wheel scratchers.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.176
My girl likes 'em.

11:45.052 --> 11:47.228
Allison.

11:47.271 --> 11:48.838
There's my girl.
How are ya?

11:48.882 --> 11:50.622
Hey, D.
I'm -- I'm good.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.363
How are you?

11:52.407 --> 11:54.452
Eh, you know, better than your
Uncle Chuck with his back.

11:54.496 --> 11:56.019
They call it
a slipped disc?

11:56.063 --> 11:57.934
More like it tripped down
three flights of stairs.

11:57.978 --> 11:59.196
But...

11:59.240 --> 12:00.981
what can you do, right?

12:01.024 --> 12:03.026
Physical therapy?

12:03.070 --> 12:05.768
Oh, sweetie,
you got a little snag.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.814
Ooh.
What's in the fancy bag?

12:07.857 --> 12:09.511
You bring your auntie
something nice.

12:09.554 --> 12:10.642
Uh, no.
It's for Kevin.

12:10.686 --> 12:13.471
I got him a watch
for our anniversary.

12:13.515 --> 12:16.213
Mm. La-de-da.

12:16.257 --> 12:18.259
-What'd he get you?
-Nothing yet.

12:18.302 --> 12:20.435
He wants me to tell him
what I want.

12:20.478 --> 12:22.045
Mm.
Good man.

12:22.089 --> 12:24.874
O-Our first anniversary,
Chuck got me running shoes.

12:24.918 --> 12:27.050
Yeah.
Can you imagine?

12:27.094 --> 12:29.052
These knees don't run.

12:29.096 --> 12:30.837
Don't make men guess.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.840
Tell him you want a Dyson
or a Pandora's bracelet.

12:33.883 --> 12:36.581
Well, I-I don't want
any of that.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.367
Sign of a good life.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.848
Hmm?

12:41.891 --> 12:43.458
You got lucky, honey.

12:43.501 --> 12:44.676
Mm?

12:44.720 --> 12:46.287
We both did.

12:48.942 --> 12:52.293
Ah.

12:56.514 --> 12:57.864
Kevin?

12:57.907 --> 12:59.866
-Present.
-Oh, good, you're home.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.258
I'm home and I'm screwed.

13:01.302 --> 13:02.651
Uh-huh.

13:02.694 --> 13:03.913
Word of the party
got around work.

13:03.957 --> 13:06.089
All the way up
to Bossman Harrison.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.525
Uh-huh.

13:07.569 --> 13:10.093
Now he's coming
and he cannot hang.

13:10.137 --> 13:12.269
I found what I want
for our anniversary.

13:12.313 --> 13:13.880
I told you to tell Neil.

13:13.923 --> 13:16.273
I did.
He's crying next door.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.103
Happy anniversary.

13:20.147 --> 13:21.844
What's this?

13:21.888 --> 13:23.280
We're moving!

13:31.767 --> 13:33.116
Okay, so we need to get
a credit report

13:33.160 --> 13:35.075
and fill out
an application.

13:35.118 --> 13:37.164
And you paid off that student
loan a while back, right?

13:37.207 --> 13:40.515
Why would I pay it back
if you never went to college?

13:40.558 --> 13:42.169
-Because you still used it.
-Yeah.

13:42.212 --> 13:45.563
To invest in Neil's Hooters
for Butts business.

13:45.607 --> 13:47.348
Ah, yes.
Only a matter of time

13:47.391 --> 13:49.872
till you see
that back-end.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.526
Can you, uh, hand me
the tablet?

13:56.139 --> 13:57.619
Why are you doing that?

13:57.662 --> 14:00.404
Well, ladies always do it
in the movies,

14:00.448 --> 14:02.537
and I wanted
to feel fancy.

14:07.107 --> 14:09.761
Kev, <i>this</i> is fancy.

14:09.805 --> 14:12.982
Look, it's got granite
countertops and a mudroom.

14:13.026 --> 14:15.332
We could be Amherst Gates
residents in one month.

14:15.376 --> 14:16.551
It's great, babe.
It is.

14:16.594 --> 14:18.553
But, I mean...

14:18.596 --> 14:20.381
do we have to go?

14:20.424 --> 14:23.601
Can't some things
just stay the same anymore?

14:23.645 --> 14:26.430
We've saved for so long.
We can cover the down payment.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.128
We can own a home.

14:28.171 --> 14:30.695
Is it really that much better
than this place?

14:36.223 --> 14:38.399
It's not about the house,
you know?

14:38.442 --> 14:40.009
It's a fresh start.

14:40.053 --> 14:42.969
We can be everything
we always wanted.

14:43.012 --> 14:46.102
I don't know
what else we could be, but...

14:46.146 --> 14:47.843
but okay.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.105
Okay.

14:49.149 --> 14:52.152
What Allison wants,
Allison gets.

14:52.195 --> 14:53.980
Good.

14:54.023 --> 14:55.198
'Cause I've already made
an appointment at the bank

14:55.242 --> 14:56.373
first thing Monday morning
after the party.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.636
Ah.
What party?

14:58.680 --> 15:02.466
It's useless now that High
and Mighty Harrison is coming.

15:02.510 --> 15:04.642
Being around him
is constant work.

15:04.686 --> 15:08.472
Oh, you say the same thing
about shoes with laces.

15:08.516 --> 15:11.780
I don't even see the point
of a party anymore.

15:11.823 --> 15:13.347
Oh, God.

15:13.390 --> 15:16.828
I've lost the will
to rage!

15:16.872 --> 15:18.743
What is there even
to live for anymore?

15:26.099 --> 15:29.058
Oh.

15:29.102 --> 15:31.191
Look at
that closet space.

15:31.234 --> 15:32.453
Wow.

15:32.496 --> 15:35.804
So much room
for cleaning products.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.458
Oh, and that bedroom.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.416
Ooh, I never wanna leave
that bedroom.

15:40.852 --> 15:42.898
I can see us now.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.856
Lying in that bed.

15:44.900 --> 15:48.251
You're wearing
some hot little thing.

15:48.295 --> 15:50.253
I'm wearing...

15:50.297 --> 15:53.691
just a T-shirt.

15:53.735 --> 15:58.218
And we can finally do that thing
you say we'll never do.

15:58.261 --> 16:01.047
We've had
this discussion.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.831
Gotta embrace change,
baby.

16:53.795 --> 16:55.710
You know, we never got to have
parties in the seminary.

16:55.753 --> 16:58.060
So that's why you had to have
sex with nuns -- the boredom.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.062
What can I say?

17:00.106 --> 17:01.281
I got in the habit.

17:03.283 --> 17:04.893
Come on!

17:04.936 --> 17:06.460
It was just one nun,

17:06.503 --> 17:08.636
and please don't talk
about my parents having sex.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.465
I thought for a second
you canceled.

17:11.508 --> 17:12.727
Ah.
Never!

17:12.770 --> 17:14.250
I had one of my strokes
of genius!

17:14.294 --> 17:15.730
I wish I'd have those.

17:15.773 --> 17:18.341
You know, instead
of the regular strokes.

17:18.385 --> 17:20.778
I realized, I spend
every Anniversa-rager

17:20.822 --> 17:22.345
putting out fires.

17:22.389 --> 17:25.087
That was one time,
and your eyebrows grew back.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.350
Mr. Harrison
is a tiny hiccup.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.918
We just gotta keep him away
from our party.

17:29.961 --> 17:33.226
So, we're gonna have another
fancy, boring-person party

17:33.269 --> 17:36.272
for him in the living room
that you get to throw.

17:36.316 --> 17:38.144
"Get to"?

17:38.187 --> 17:40.189
You'll distract Harrison
with wine

17:40.233 --> 17:41.973
and tiny crackers
in the living room,

17:42.017 --> 17:43.845
and I'll take care
of the real party.

17:43.888 --> 17:45.281
Okay, but you really think
he's not gonna notice

17:45.325 --> 17:47.109
a party
in the next room?

17:47.153 --> 17:51.113
We're having our party
in the backyard, Allison.

17:51.157 --> 17:53.463
Think of the kitchen as a buffer
between the two,

17:53.507 --> 17:56.379
and you -- you're the most
important part of the plan.

17:56.423 --> 17:57.772
You're the gatekeeper.

17:57.815 --> 17:59.208
Like St. Peter.

17:59.252 --> 18:00.557
But more judgmental.

18:03.386 --> 18:05.649
I have always wanted to have
the boss over for dinner.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.564
It's what people do,
right?
Great.

18:07.608 --> 18:10.001
Then since it's also <i>
your</i> party,

18:10.045 --> 18:12.439
you get to pick up
the supplies.

18:12.482 --> 18:14.658
"Get to"?

18:14.702 --> 18:16.965
Okay, but if I do this,
you have to behave, okay?

18:17.008 --> 18:18.967
No liquor.
Only beer.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.447
We have that appointment at
the bank first thing tomorrow.

18:20.490 --> 18:23.014
Hey, I'll take it easy
like Sunday morning.

18:23.058 --> 18:24.277
-It's Monday morning.
-What?

18:24.320 --> 18:26.017
Huh?

18:26.061 --> 18:27.671
Just don't go crazy,
okay?

18:27.715 --> 18:29.456
We need the bank guy
to believe

18:29.499 --> 18:31.153
that we're the kind of people
who deserve a new house.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.634
You're not actually moving,
right?

18:33.677 --> 18:35.766
This is like when you said
you were going back to school?

18:35.810 --> 18:38.204
Or when you wanted
to go to Paris?

18:38.247 --> 18:40.031
Yeah, we'll just kinda all
pretend it's happening

18:40.075 --> 18:41.946
until you come
to your senses?

18:41.990 --> 18:43.818
Nope.
You and your sister

18:43.861 --> 18:45.472
are gonna have new neighbors
to torture.

18:45.515 --> 18:47.082
It's happening, Neil.

18:49.998 --> 18:52.087
Oh.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.523
I don't want you
to overreact --

18:53.567 --> 18:55.656
I'm dying inside!

18:58.441 --> 19:00.051
And outside!

19:03.881 --> 19:05.448
Should we --I'm good.

19:36.436 --> 19:38.220
Give me the lip stain
in candy apple.

19:41.963 --> 19:43.443
Please.

19:50.406 --> 19:52.495
Ugh.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.149
Kevin?

19:54.193 --> 19:57.370
Oh.
Talk slower.

19:57.413 --> 19:58.632
Okay.

19:58.675 --> 20:00.111
Please stop saying "meats."

20:00.155 --> 20:01.983
Meats!

20:02.026 --> 20:04.072
I just found out
that Mr. Harrison goes nuts

20:04.115 --> 20:06.030
for those fancy cheese
and meat plates,

20:06.074 --> 20:08.250
so I need you
to pick one up.

20:08.294 --> 20:09.904
Because I'm busy.

20:09.947 --> 20:12.646
I'm auditioning Tom Brady
look-alikes for the party.

20:16.127 --> 20:19.740
Tampa Bay is trash, man.

20:19.783 --> 20:21.176
People adore you here.

20:24.092 --> 20:27.313
You should've stayed.

20:27.356 --> 20:28.488
Well, I had a great run
in New England, and I --

20:28.531 --> 20:30.316
Why does
everybody leave?!

20:30.359 --> 20:32.709
Neil, buddy, take it easy.

20:32.753 --> 20:34.929
We're gonna be okay.

20:34.972 --> 20:36.713
Meats and cheeses.

20:49.857 --> 20:50.988
Hey, honey.

20:51.032 --> 20:53.339
A smile looks nice on you.

20:53.382 --> 20:55.471
Hey, you wanna see
if you pass inspection?

20:55.515 --> 20:56.516
-No thanks.
-It's a joke.

20:56.559 --> 20:57.995
It's a joke.

20:58.039 --> 20:58.735
If you wanna party in the back,
though...

20:58.779 --> 21:00.302
No.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.043
Well, I'm here all the time,
you change your mind.

21:18.799 --> 21:20.235
Um, hi.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.802
I was hoping to get a coffee
and that maybe

21:21.845 --> 21:23.717
you had
a charcuterie plate.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.936
The charcuterie plate
is on our catering menu,

21:25.980 --> 21:27.111
so you'd
have to place those order --

21:27.155 --> 21:28.417
Aah. Aah!

21:28.461 --> 21:29.549
Shit. Shit.

21:29.592 --> 21:31.594
Oh!

21:31.638 --> 21:32.682
Sam.

21:32.726 --> 21:34.249
Allie.

21:36.207 --> 21:38.209
Thought I might see you
at some point.

21:38.253 --> 21:39.950
You look [Sighs]...
No.

21:39.994 --> 21:41.735
...exactly the same.

21:43.084 --> 21:47.001
Uh, h-- wh--
you, uh, moved back?

21:47.044 --> 21:49.656
And you work
at a diner?

21:49.699 --> 21:51.614
Close.
I moved back,

21:51.658 --> 21:54.617
and I <i>own</i> a diner.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.837
This is yours?

21:56.880 --> 21:58.534
Okay.

21:58.578 --> 22:01.494
Oh, yeah, well, I'm surprised
I didn't recognize you.

22:01.537 --> 22:03.974
Well, market research
shows people in New England

22:04.018 --> 22:07.848
like diners where they think
a white lady cooks the food.

22:07.891 --> 22:10.067
Doesn't market research
also show that

22:10.111 --> 22:12.243
Worcester is not the best place
to open a yuppie diner?

22:12.287 --> 22:13.593
You'd be surprised.

22:13.636 --> 22:15.029
Worcester's
an up-and-coming city.

22:15.072 --> 22:16.770
No, it's not.
No, it's not.

22:16.813 --> 22:19.555
Oh.

22:19.599 --> 22:20.817
But I wanted
to come back.

22:20.861 --> 22:23.342
But why?
You got out.

22:23.385 --> 22:24.299
You got to live
in New York City.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.301
Well, Syracuse.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.085
Okay, well, <i>
a</i> New York city.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.439
So, what'd I miss
the last 15 years?

22:33.482 --> 22:35.092
In Worcester?

22:35.136 --> 22:37.094
Um...

22:37.138 --> 22:38.618
oh.

22:38.661 --> 22:41.055
There were, like,
three new traffic plans

22:41.098 --> 22:42.926
for Kelly Square
that you missed out on.

22:42.970 --> 22:45.451
-So...condolences.
-Mm.

22:45.494 --> 22:47.714
I must be crazy
coming back here.

22:47.757 --> 22:51.021
Yeah.
So, um, why did you?

22:51.065 --> 22:54.634
Kinda just pulls you back.

22:54.677 --> 22:57.680
Yeah. I get it.

22:57.724 --> 23:00.248
Uh, so, how long you been back,
and where you staying?

23:00.291 --> 23:03.599
Well, uh, Jenn's parents
are still in their old house.

23:03.643 --> 23:04.948
Right.

23:04.992 --> 23:06.080
We're actually renovating
a place

23:06.123 --> 23:07.603
down near
the old water tower.

23:07.647 --> 23:08.822
Ah.

23:08.865 --> 23:12.042
Happy for you.

23:12.086 --> 23:14.697
Okay.
Um, well, I'm gonna get going.

23:14.741 --> 23:16.351
Hold on. I can make
that charcuterie plate for you.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.874
-No, don't worry about it.
-I don't mind. Really, I'm --

23:17.918 --> 23:20.790
I can take care of it.

23:20.834 --> 23:22.488
But thank you.

23:36.371 --> 23:37.938
Hmm.

23:37.981 --> 23:39.505
I shoulda known you'd be trouble
when you tried

23:39.548 --> 23:41.463
to drop your accent
in high school.

23:51.734 --> 23:53.780
Meats.

24:00.003 --> 24:01.744
Hey.
Hey.

24:03.746 --> 24:06.183
What?

24:06.227 --> 24:07.794
Nothing.

24:20.415 --> 24:22.504
Wow. Some party.

24:22.548 --> 24:23.940
Uh, it's...

24:23.984 --> 24:25.159
elegant.

24:25.202 --> 24:28.249
-It's understated.
-It's dead.

24:28.292 --> 24:30.207
Can't you get some of the people
from outside to come in here?

24:30.251 --> 24:31.208
I could use a few bodies.

24:31.252 --> 24:33.602
Babe,
it's <i>our</i> anniversary.

24:33.646 --> 24:34.951
Of course I'm not gonna
ask my friends

24:34.995 --> 24:37.171
to come
to this lame thing.

24:37.214 --> 24:38.607
You can ask some
of your dad's friends.

24:38.651 --> 24:40.566
No, no, no. They're outside
revving up the tattoo gun.

24:40.609 --> 24:42.350
Oh.

24:42.393 --> 24:44.134
This whole event
is a finely tuned machine.

24:44.178 --> 24:45.440
Why are you trying
to mess with it?

24:45.484 --> 24:47.790
I'm anxious.
We have to be up early.

24:47.834 --> 24:49.357
I'm already thinking
about cleanup.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.967
So, we're having a party
and you're thinking

24:51.011 --> 24:52.708
about cleaning up?

24:52.752 --> 24:55.232
I always forget mental illness
runs in your family.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.541
I brought the name tags.

24:59.585 --> 25:01.804
I'm pretty sure we already know
each other's names.

25:01.848 --> 25:03.240
"Kelvin"?
Yeah.

25:03.284 --> 25:05.460
Kevin McRoberts has
some complaints

25:05.504 --> 25:07.157
on the ol' cable
company record,

25:07.201 --> 25:09.246
so when Bossman Harrison
got hired,

25:09.290 --> 25:15.035
I introduced myself
as Kelvin McLoberts.

25:15.078 --> 25:17.080
Hey, no permanent marker
on the coffee table.

25:17.124 --> 25:18.560
Goodwill.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.606
It's Pottery Barn.

25:20.649 --> 25:23.304
I gotta get outside,
control the flow.

25:23.347 --> 25:25.654
I can't be stuck in here waiting
for my pain-in-the-ass boss,

25:25.698 --> 25:27.743
Mr. H-Harrison.

25:27.787 --> 25:29.484
Welcome.

25:29.528 --> 25:32.574
We were just discussing
a new TV show.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.054
"Ass Boss."

25:36.883 --> 25:38.232
Kelvin.
Whoa.

25:38.275 --> 25:40.016
Geez.

25:40.060 --> 25:41.583
Haven't had something
this fancy since communion.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.019
Oh.

25:43.063 --> 25:45.413
Mr. Harrison,
so glad you could come.

25:45.456 --> 25:46.806
Mrs. McLoberts.

25:46.849 --> 25:48.503
Strong handshake
from a little lady.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.766
Most women develop osteoporosis
by 50.

25:50.810 --> 25:52.202
Good for you.

25:52.246 --> 25:53.508
50?
I'm not even close.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.858
Ooh, is that
a charcuterie plate?

25:55.902 --> 25:58.252
It sure is.

25:58.295 --> 26:01.908
Oh, thank God.
You're needed outside ASAP.

26:01.951 --> 26:04.475
The Tom Bradys are saying they
can beat anyone at flip cup,

26:04.519 --> 26:06.042
and they called you out
by name.

26:10.656 --> 26:12.875
Mr. Harrison?
Uh, this is my neighbor Neil.

26:12.919 --> 26:17.227
Hi, I'm Kelvin's neighbor
and closest companion, Neil.

26:17.271 --> 26:18.664
He needs me to help him
with a problem

26:18.707 --> 26:19.882
in his house for a moment.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.492
His plumbing --Caught on fire.

26:24.931 --> 26:26.802
Yup.
His plumbing caught on fire.

26:28.891 --> 26:30.632
The gas lines got tangled up
with the water pipes.

26:30.676 --> 26:32.242
It happens
more than you think.

26:32.286 --> 26:34.201
Yeah.
I should go deal with that.

26:34.244 --> 26:36.072
Yeah.
Now?

26:36.116 --> 26:37.639
'Cause the party
just started.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.859
I know.
But I'm needed elsewhere.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.784
It's nice to have
good neighbors.

26:51.827 --> 26:53.612
Yeah.

26:56.310 --> 26:58.355
Well, uh,
don't ruin your dinner.

26:58.399 --> 26:59.966
I made quail.
Oh.

27:06.799 --> 27:09.715
Can I just ask...

27:09.758 --> 27:13.066
do you have a mudroom?

27:13.109 --> 27:15.111
I do.

27:15.155 --> 27:16.678
Great.

27:30.213 --> 27:33.260
I...

27:33.303 --> 27:35.131
like your coffee table.

27:35.175 --> 27:36.480
Thank you.

27:44.358 --> 27:47.187
Can I get you
a glass of wine?

27:47.230 --> 27:48.971
Alright.

27:49.015 --> 27:50.190
Great.

27:50.233 --> 27:51.757
I'll be right back.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.141
No, no, no.
Where'd he go?

28:32.275 --> 28:34.364
Guys, guys, be cool.
I don't think he's into this.

28:34.408 --> 28:36.932
-What the hell?
-Gah!

28:39.021 --> 28:41.632
Kelvin, I never --I-It was Allison's idea!

28:41.676 --> 28:43.765
I never get to be
one of the boys!

28:44.984 --> 28:46.159
Wait, what?

28:46.202 --> 28:48.161
Nobody invites me
anywhere!

28:48.204 --> 28:50.032
People forget that
behind the grandeur

28:50.076 --> 28:52.208
of "regional director
of installation,"

28:52.252 --> 28:54.515
I'm just a man.

28:54.558 --> 28:56.735
A man who likes
the simple things in life.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.606
Like shotgunning brewskies
with guys

28:58.649 --> 29:01.478
who slightly resemble
Tom Brady.

29:01.522 --> 29:04.046
He's my fourth cousin.

29:04.090 --> 29:06.266
Sure he is, bro.

29:06.309 --> 29:08.529
I knew you were gonna be
a good time.

29:08.572 --> 29:10.052
That's why I made sure
Brenda invited you.

29:10.096 --> 29:11.662
She didn't.

29:11.706 --> 29:12.707
She didn't invite me.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.448
Aw.
Damn Brenda!

29:14.491 --> 29:16.798
Doesn't think I can hang.

29:16.842 --> 29:17.886
What?

29:17.930 --> 29:20.889
Has she seen you do that?

29:20.933 --> 29:22.935
I'm so glad I made it.

29:22.978 --> 29:27.504
And now that the party's
finally getting good, thank God.

29:27.548 --> 29:28.854
Why don't you join us
in the backyard?

29:28.897 --> 29:30.899
We can do another
beer bong hit out there.

29:30.943 --> 29:33.467
Uh, you think we can do it
with a nice Pinot this time?

29:33.510 --> 29:34.729
Sure.

29:57.926 --> 29:59.406
Mm.

30:28.739 --> 30:31.264
Everyone!

30:31.307 --> 30:32.743
Listen up!

30:32.787 --> 30:35.137
This has truly been
my best party yet!

30:36.530 --> 30:37.923
Happy anniversary!

30:37.966 --> 30:39.925
Oh.
Is it somebody's anniversary?

30:39.968 --> 30:43.319
-Congrats!
-Thank you!

30:43.363 --> 30:45.495
But I also wanna use
my party

30:45.539 --> 30:49.673
to share some news
about a life-changing move.

30:49.717 --> 30:51.371
Where's Allison?

30:51.414 --> 30:52.720
Can we get Allison up here?
There she is.

30:52.763 --> 30:53.895
Come here, babe.

30:55.810 --> 30:58.726
Come on up. Yeah, up here.
Come on.

30:58.769 --> 31:01.598
Uh, we both want to thank
you all for coming, uh,

31:01.642 --> 31:04.123
but especially
Mr. Harrison.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.560
Yeah.
Terry.

31:06.603 --> 31:08.692
Because Terry has just
offered me

31:08.736 --> 31:11.173
the opportunity
of a lifetime.

31:11.217 --> 31:17.092
Terry is moving me over
from cable to fiber optics.

31:17.136 --> 31:18.789
So, you know
what that means.

31:18.833 --> 31:20.617
-No.
-Wait.

31:20.661 --> 31:22.576
Are you saying... Oh, yes, Neil.

31:22.619 --> 31:24.795
We decided
we're staying.

31:24.839 --> 31:25.796
We did?

31:34.066 --> 31:36.155
I thought you said this was
from Pottery Barn.

31:46.817 --> 31:48.819
He's drunk.
He's not gonna remember this.

31:48.863 --> 31:50.778
We're going, we're going, we're
going, we're going, we're going.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.438
Ow! God!

31:58.481 --> 31:59.569
Crap!
Mother eff--

31:59.613 --> 32:01.789
My God.
-Oh.

32:01.832 --> 32:03.617
Just swear.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.488
"Eff" is so much worse.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.624
You throwing a little tantrum
out here?

32:10.667 --> 32:12.800
Just getting
some fresh air.

32:12.843 --> 32:14.628
Oh.
And the mailbox offended you.

32:16.195 --> 32:17.848
Oh.

32:17.892 --> 32:19.459
It's a party.

32:19.502 --> 32:20.808
Not death row.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.160
Do you ever think about maybe
trying to have

32:25.204 --> 32:27.815
just a little bit of fun?

32:27.858 --> 32:29.643
I'm not talking about
scoring crack or anything,

32:29.686 --> 32:34.300
but maybe indulge
in a hard seltzer?

32:34.343 --> 32:35.823
I don't feel like
celebrating.

32:35.866 --> 32:38.652
Oh, right.
Silly me.

32:38.695 --> 32:40.697
We're all in mourning
'cause Barbie lost out on her

32:40.741 --> 32:42.830
-Dream House.
-It's not about the house!

32:45.093 --> 32:47.661
I'm just s-so tired.

32:47.704 --> 32:50.229
Yeah.
Who sleeps these days?

32:50.272 --> 32:52.274
Oh, Jesus, I mean mentally.

32:52.318 --> 32:55.060
Aren't you?

32:55.103 --> 32:56.670
I wake up,
I go to the salon,

32:56.713 --> 32:58.063
I come home,
I watch a game with the guys.

32:58.106 --> 33:00.630
In between, there are a few
Dunkie's coffees

33:00.674 --> 33:02.197
and a pack of menthols.

33:02.241 --> 33:04.156
You're okay with that?

33:04.199 --> 33:06.027
Everyone knows what their life's
gonna look like in 10,

33:06.071 --> 33:08.377
20 years.

33:08.421 --> 33:12.077
Pretending things'll change is
how they sell washing machines.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.470
I'm just --
I'm tired of trying.

33:16.777 --> 33:18.997
I feel like nothing I do
is ever enough.

33:21.216 --> 33:26.439
I really think if I could
start over and go somewhere else

33:26.482 --> 33:28.049
and just do everything
right this time,

33:28.093 --> 33:29.485
I can finally be...

33:31.792 --> 33:35.100
like, done.

33:35.143 --> 33:36.753
Is that insane?

33:41.497 --> 33:44.326
You know how many people
come to my salon every week

33:44.370 --> 33:47.764
thinking a perm will solve
all their problems?

33:47.808 --> 33:50.115
I mean...

33:50.158 --> 33:52.900
maybe you're insane,

33:52.943 --> 33:53.988
but you're not alone.

33:57.774 --> 34:01.474
Calling me crazy is the nicest
you ever been to me.

34:01.517 --> 34:03.041
You're welcome.

34:05.608 --> 34:08.481
But this isn't just a perm.

34:08.524 --> 34:11.092
I'm not giving up on this.
I can't.

34:11.136 --> 34:13.268
I can get Kevin to that bank
tomorrow morning.

34:13.312 --> 34:15.096
I-I don't care
if he's still

34:15.140 --> 34:18.578
taking pulls off
a handle of tequila.

34:18.621 --> 34:21.798
I know it doesn't seem like it,
but I know how to work Kevin.

34:21.842 --> 34:23.626
He's capable of stuff.

34:23.670 --> 34:25.585
Like how I got him
to remember our anniversary.

34:25.628 --> 34:28.283
You just have to make him
think that it's his idea.

34:28.327 --> 34:29.371
You know?
We can still --

34:29.415 --> 34:32.374
Jesus, Allison.

34:32.418 --> 34:33.723
What?

34:33.767 --> 34:36.552
Come on.
Wake the hell up.

34:36.596 --> 34:39.164
There's no "we" in there.

34:39.207 --> 34:42.080
What the hell do you know?

34:42.123 --> 34:43.603
Nobody thinks that we're
leaving, but I promise you --

34:43.646 --> 34:45.213
The account's empty.

34:48.390 --> 34:50.827
What?

34:50.871 --> 34:54.396
The weekly savings thing.

34:54.440 --> 34:57.834
It's gone.

34:57.878 --> 34:59.184
That's not possible,
'cause I was there

34:59.227 --> 35:02.012
when we opened
the account.

35:02.056 --> 35:05.277
Like 10 years ago, and then you
let <i>him</i> keep track of the money.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.540
'Cause I'm bad
with money.

35:07.583 --> 35:10.238
You think he's better?

35:10.282 --> 35:12.022
Come on.
How many times a week

35:12.066 --> 35:13.546
does a package
come to this house?

35:13.589 --> 35:14.851
All you gotta do
is pay attention.

35:14.895 --> 35:16.418
He wouldn't go
into that account.

35:19.204 --> 35:21.641
A few years ago, he got into
some hot water

35:21.684 --> 35:25.558
trading fake
sports memorabilia.

35:25.601 --> 35:29.736
He asked Neil for money,
who of course came to me.

35:31.216 --> 35:32.391
He said you have nothing.

35:35.698 --> 35:40.355
But we were gonna leave...
start over.

35:40.399 --> 35:42.749
He said that things
were gonna change.

35:50.235 --> 35:52.802
They were never
gonna change.

35:55.718 --> 35:57.242
They're never
gonna change.

36:04.684 --> 36:05.641
Oh.

36:05.685 --> 36:08.470
I'm sorry.

36:08.514 --> 36:10.124

I'm a bad driver.
I've accepted that.

37:24.807 --> 37:27.680
I'm a bad driver with split ends
and an overbite.

37:31.771 --> 37:34.556
Ah.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.515
When my husband's in the car
with me, he says,

37:36.558 --> 37:39.431
"Oh, you shouldn't
drive so slow.

37:39.474 --> 37:41.171
Oh, don't let so many people
pull out in front of you.

37:41.215 --> 37:44.784
Uh, you should use
your horn more."

37:44.827 --> 37:46.133
I get nervous
behind the wheel,

37:46.176 --> 37:48.483
and driving's
all about confidence.

37:48.527 --> 37:51.617
So, that's why I'm not
a good driver.

37:51.660 --> 37:52.922
I'm a bad driver.

37:55.838 --> 37:59.233
But, you know,
I've been thinking.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.583
I've never been
in an accident.

38:01.627 --> 38:05.021
And I can drive stick,
I can parallel park,

38:05.065 --> 38:06.806
I can merge, and, you know,

38:06.849 --> 38:10.940
I actually think that I actually
used to enjoy driving.

38:13.639 --> 38:15.554
Oh, I like this.

38:18.513 --> 38:20.820
But we have one car, and
he doesn't have to share it.

38:20.863 --> 38:22.604
He doesn't have
to share anything.

38:22.648 --> 38:24.345
He gets me all to himself,

38:24.389 --> 38:25.999
'cause I never went back
to school,

38:26.042 --> 38:27.609
and he says that's 'cause
I never finish things.

38:27.653 --> 38:30.656
But do I never
finish things,

38:30.699 --> 38:33.049
or does he take them
from me?

38:36.488 --> 38:38.794
Am I bad at driving,
or does he want the car?

38:41.101 --> 38:43.364
As long as I had
this thing -- this just --

38:43.408 --> 38:46.019
like, this image of what
I --

38:46.062 --> 38:49.109
what we could be,
I had something to hope for.

38:49.152 --> 38:52.547
But now I try to picture
anything good, and...

38:59.511 --> 39:00.990
Like, what the hell
are you supposed to do

39:01.034 --> 39:02.470
if you can't close your eyes
and picture a future

39:02.514 --> 39:04.385
where everything's okay?

39:04.429 --> 39:06.169
Because dreaming's useless
with him around,

39:06.213 --> 39:09.434
so, what,
do I just go numb?

39:09.477 --> 39:12.654
Oh, yeah, that'll happen.
That shit's real pure.

39:12.698 --> 39:15.614
What?

39:15.657 --> 39:17.006
No.

39:17.050 --> 39:19.052
You aren't listening.

39:19.095 --> 39:21.620
I'm a --
I'm a customer,

39:21.663 --> 39:25.711
and you couldn't be bothered
just to pay attention?

39:25.754 --> 39:27.713
Is the sound of my voice
impossible to hear?

39:27.756 --> 39:30.672
'Cause if you're having trouble,
I can go louder, you dick!

39:30.716 --> 39:32.282
Aah!

39:32.326 --> 39:33.414
What the hell, lady?!

39:33.458 --> 39:35.024
Oh, my God.

39:35.068 --> 39:37.244
Oh, shit, Marcus,
that bitch bitch-slapped you.

39:37.287 --> 39:39.159
Oh, I am so sorry.

39:41.291 --> 39:43.076
No, you know what?

39:43.119 --> 39:45.208
I'm not sorry.

39:45.252 --> 39:46.862
The hell with that.
I deserve --

39:46.906 --> 39:48.342
Oh! I'm sorry.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.300
Sorry.

39:50.344 --> 39:52.215
You should really ice that.

40:05.794 --> 40:08.362
Wow.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.233
Kevin thought you were out
for a run.

40:10.277 --> 40:12.888
What the hell have you
been doing?

40:12.932 --> 40:15.500
Um, I was sort of running.

40:15.543 --> 40:17.153
Why are we talking
like this?

40:17.197 --> 40:18.807
Kevin's in the kitchen.
He's gonna surprise you.

40:18.851 --> 40:21.157
With what?

40:21.201 --> 40:23.508
Hold on.

40:23.551 --> 40:25.118
Oh.

40:25.161 --> 40:27.294
Oh.
Caught me.

40:27.337 --> 40:29.383
I, uh, had a bit
of a rough morning

40:29.427 --> 40:31.777
and I needed
a few jelly Munchkins.

40:32.865 --> 40:37.304
So, um, did you tell him
I know about the account?

40:37.347 --> 40:39.437
Tell Kevin I ratted him out?
Come on.

40:39.480 --> 40:43.745
He had a feud with the mail
woman and got her deported.

40:43.789 --> 40:45.660
Yeah.

40:45.704 --> 40:47.401
That's why you waited years
to tell me?

40:50.404 --> 40:51.884
Hey.

40:53.712 --> 40:56.279
Are you okay?

40:56.323 --> 40:58.456
I have no idea.

41:03.417 --> 41:06.115
Uh...babe, I'm sorry
I passed out

41:06.159 --> 41:08.378
in your rose bushes
last night.

41:08.422 --> 41:10.990
We don't have
rose bushes.

41:11.033 --> 41:12.557
Well,
where'd you pass out?

41:12.600 --> 41:15.168
'Cause you look...

41:15.211 --> 41:17.562
wonderful.

41:17.605 --> 41:20.303
Very quick.
I think she bought it.

41:20.347 --> 41:22.001
This looks fun.

41:22.044 --> 41:24.482
Yeah, well, I know I had
too much liquor last night,

41:24.525 --> 41:27.572
and when I woke up
with rose thorns in my tongue,

41:27.615 --> 41:29.487
I realized you're right.

41:29.530 --> 41:31.445
It's time to grow up.
I gotta change.

41:31.489 --> 41:34.622
So, no more
Anniversa-ragers.

41:34.666 --> 41:38.539
-Wow.
-I decided that we should
celebrate your way,

41:38.583 --> 41:40.410
do what you wanted
this whole time --

41:40.454 --> 41:42.108
-a boring dinner.
-A grown-up dinner!

41:42.151 --> 41:44.023
A grown-up dinner.

41:44.066 --> 41:46.242
In the morning.

41:46.286 --> 41:48.201
Wait. If this is dinner,

41:48.244 --> 41:51.247
that means beers
are fair game.

41:51.291 --> 41:55.208
Neil, ideas like that are why
I keep you around.

41:55.251 --> 41:58.820
Allison, you mind?

41:58.864 --> 42:01.257
And, babe, uh,
about moving?

42:01.301 --> 42:03.259
You know, that money
in the bank is --

42:03.303 --> 42:06.088
it's only gonna grow, and if you
pick up a few more shifts

42:06.132 --> 42:08.177
at the package store,
we're gonna be able to move

42:08.221 --> 42:10.440
wherever your
little heart desires.

42:10.484 --> 42:13.487
What Allison wants,
Allison gets.

42:30.199 --> 42:31.853
Shit, Kevin!

42:31.897 --> 42:34.290
Kevin!
What did you do?!

42:52.961 --> 42:55.094
What?

42:55.137 --> 42:57.575
You...broke it.

43:00.665 --> 43:03.232
Whoa!
Ms. Hercules over here!

43:04.364 --> 43:05.713
Is that blood?

43:05.757 --> 43:07.280
It doesn't mean
you get to be moody.

43:07.323 --> 43:09.195
You already used that excuse
once this month.

43:11.545 --> 43:12.894
I'll be fine.

43:12.938 --> 43:15.244
Honey,
go bandage that hand.

43:15.288 --> 43:17.072
We still got dinner
at breakfast,

43:17.116 --> 43:19.248
and I can't wait to see
what you're gonna cook.

43:42.184 --> 43:44.665
<i>On the next
"Kevin Can Himself"...</i>

43:44.709 --> 43:47.799
I'm the gift that
keeps on giving, baby.

43:47.842 --> 43:50.192
-That's crazy.
-That's marriage.

43:51.585 --> 43:53.631
You blew up my life.
Was that just for fun?

43:53.674 --> 43:55.110
I felt sorry for you.

43:56.242 --> 43:57.939
I actually
wanted to talk.

43:57.983 --> 43:59.201
To me?

43:59.245 --> 44:00.681
How did you do it?

44:00.725 --> 44:03.162
I killed him with oxycodone,
and made it look like an OD.

44:03.205 --> 44:03.902
Yeah!

44:14.782 --> 44:17.567
