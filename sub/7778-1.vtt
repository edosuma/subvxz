01:38.945 --> 01:41.914
Here. Right here. Just wait.

01:43.583 --> 01:46.450
Sorry. I'm late. I...

01:51.425 --> 01:53.256
I ain't dead yet.

01:54.428 --> 01:56.055
It's also for healing.

01:58.398 --> 02:00.229
And celebration, you know?

02:14.514 --> 02:15.742
Hey.

02:35.502 --> 02:36.594
Yeah.

02:40.807 --> 02:43.640
- Thank you.
- I'd like to sit at that table.

02:44.911 --> 02:48.369
- Why?
- I'd like to sit at that table.

02:50.217 --> 02:52.777
- I know, but they're still eating. It's fine...
- I can see that.

02:53.620 --> 02:55.144
I don't know, I think...

02:56.723 --> 02:59.749
I think in, like, a year or so, you know,
I think I'll be ready...

02:59.826 --> 03:03.125
...but, you know, I really...
I want to get married.

03:03.196 --> 03:06.029
I just... Like, eventually, you know.
I don't...

03:07.901 --> 03:09.459
I just don't want to right now.

03:10.337 --> 03:14.797
Plus, we're kind of on this,
like, cruise control, you know?

03:15.575 --> 03:18.442
Which is normal. I mean, it happens to
every couple. It happened to us.

03:18.512 --> 03:20.878
Where did you tell him you were going?

03:20.947 --> 03:23.643
- To visit you.
- Yeah, right.

03:25.519 --> 03:27.043
To visit my dad.

03:27.120 --> 03:30.556
- And he believed that?
- I invited him actually, but...

03:30.624 --> 03:33.889
...it turns out he was really, really busy.

03:36.863 --> 03:38.956
You always were a terrific liar.

03:41.301 --> 03:43.030
That's not fair.

03:53.413 --> 03:55.881
- I really do love him, you know?
- Well, I do.

03:55.949 --> 03:58.247
He's the right guy for you.

04:01.855 --> 04:05.256
I mean, what do you want to do?

04:05.325 --> 04:08.988
Are you thinking... Family?
Bachelorhood?

04:10.330 --> 04:12.025
College? Job?

04:18.238 --> 04:20.399
You don't have to worry about me.

04:20.473 --> 04:22.771
The world's my fucking oyster.

04:31.451 --> 04:33.078
Thanks for coming.

04:35.155 --> 04:36.884
I really wanted to see you.

04:39.326 --> 04:40.816
I'm glad you came.

04:53.173 --> 04:54.800
Say hi to Alan for me.

05:02.582 --> 05:04.072
I don't think so.

05:39.853 --> 05:41.411
Somewhere you gotta be?

05:42.722 --> 05:43.780
No, sir.

05:48.328 --> 05:49.989
How long has he been waiting?

05:53.800 --> 05:55.631
Seventeen minutes, sir.

06:00.306 --> 06:01.830
Send him in.

06:01.908 --> 06:02.966
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

06:07.213 --> 06:08.407
Come in.

06:15.321 --> 06:17.755
Sir, Staff Sergeant Montgomery reports.

06:19.125 --> 06:22.617
At ease. How you getting on, Montgomery?

06:22.696 --> 06:25.563
- It's going well, sir.
- I have an assignment for you, Montgomery.

06:25.632 --> 06:28.795
It so happens that over the few months you
have left on your enlistment...

06:28.868 --> 06:33.396
...you will get your chance to render some of
your most valuable service to your country.

06:33.473 --> 06:37.136
I'm assigning you to
a Casualty Notification team.

06:39.679 --> 06:40.771
Sir?

06:40.847 --> 06:43.907
Captain Stone will show you the ropes.

06:44.951 --> 06:46.612
He is the expert.

06:47.987 --> 06:51.423
But until he does,
I just want to make myself very clear...

06:51.491 --> 06:55.222
...that although most of your time will
remain occupied by your other duties...

06:55.295 --> 06:59.698
CNO is to be your absolute priority.

07:00.767 --> 07:03.031
This mission is not simply important.

07:03.903 --> 07:05.393
It is sacred.

07:05.472 --> 07:07.531
- Sir, if I may?
- Go ahead.

07:07.607 --> 07:11.270
I've never received any grief counseling,
let alone given it.

07:11.978 --> 07:14.344
I'm not a religious man, sir.

07:14.414 --> 07:16.439
We're just there for notification.

07:16.516 --> 07:19.576
Not God. Not heaven.

07:21.321 --> 07:22.652
Montgomery...

07:22.722 --> 07:26.658
...this job is about character.

07:28.561 --> 07:33.089
Now I have had soldiers go out on
notification and break into a stutter.

07:33.166 --> 07:37.796
Men so nervous they read from a script
or get the name wrong...

07:37.871 --> 07:39.771
...or the address.

07:39.839 --> 07:42.307
Too many tears.

07:42.375 --> 07:45.367
I need men of solid stature.

07:47.413 --> 07:51.577
Now you are a model soldier.
Hell, you're a goddamn hero.

07:55.889 --> 07:58.687
Casualty is a soldier who's
been killed, wounded, missing...

07:58.758 --> 08:01.488
...captured, beleaguered or besieged.

08:01.561 --> 08:04.394
Of course, our job's mainly about killed.

08:05.165 --> 08:07.360
What you actually need
to do is pretty simple...

08:08.134 --> 08:10.227
...read the guidebook, learn the script...

08:10.303 --> 08:13.204
...stick to the script, fill in the blanks
from the casualty report.

08:13.273 --> 08:15.571
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.

08:16.409 --> 08:18.809
Can you look at me when I speak with you?

08:19.512 --> 08:21.002
Much appreciated.

08:22.849 --> 08:26.216
Never say stuff like lost
or expired or passed away...

08:26.286 --> 08:27.981
...things people misunderstand.

08:28.054 --> 08:32.821
I knew this guy once told this old lady
that her grandson was no longer with us.

08:32.892 --> 08:37.192
She thought he had defected to the enemy,
started calling him a traitor.

08:40.833 --> 08:44.099
We need to be clear.
Need to say killed or died.

08:44.169 --> 08:47.003
What we don't say
is the deceased or the body.

08:47.073 --> 08:50.565
We call each casualty by name.
We honor them. You with me?

08:50.643 --> 08:52.668
- Yes, sir.
- Then look at me, Sergeant.

08:55.415 --> 08:58.748
You do not speak with anybody
other than the next of kin.

08:58.818 --> 09:02.185
No friend, no neighbor,
no coworker or mistress.

09:02.255 --> 09:05.281
Hours of operation are 0600 to 2200 hours.

09:05.358 --> 09:07.622
We don't want to wake anybody
up in the middle of the night...

09:07.694 --> 09:10.720
...though if you ask me, hitting them with
the news at the crack of dawn...

09:10.797 --> 09:14.426
...is not exactly a great way
to start their day, breakfastwise.

09:15.702 --> 09:18.535
What do we do if
the next of kin isn't around?

09:18.605 --> 09:21.665
We leave. We don't wait. We don't lurk.
We come back later.

09:21.741 --> 09:26.144
This is a zero-defect mission.
A pure hit-and-git operation.

09:28.014 --> 09:29.504
Is that it, sir?

09:30.350 --> 09:34.548
One more thing.
You do not touch the NOK.

09:35.855 --> 09:39.222
Avoid physical contact
with the next of kin...

09:39.292 --> 09:43.661
...unless it's a medical emergency, like if they
were having a heart attack or something.

09:46.065 --> 09:49.193
You're representing the Secretary of the Army,
not Will Montgomery.

09:49.269 --> 09:52.602
So in case you feel like offering a hug
or something, don't.

09:52.672 --> 09:54.537
It'll only get you in trouble.

09:55.241 --> 09:58.972
I'm not gonna be offering any hugs, sir.

10:01.147 --> 10:03.138
- Is that's it?
- No.

10:03.216 --> 10:06.083
These are the rules. It's not the job.

10:06.152 --> 10:07.813
The job is about...

10:10.390 --> 10:11.823
...something else.

10:11.891 --> 10:14.655
You gotta do it before you can understand.

10:18.264 --> 10:19.754
You a head case?

10:21.668 --> 10:23.101
No, sir.

10:24.604 --> 10:26.299
I surely hope not.

10:29.008 --> 10:32.341
Then that's it. You can go.

10:50.396 --> 10:52.864
Sergeant, one more thing.

10:54.434 --> 10:58.666
We make it our business to deliver
the news within 24 hours of positive I D.

10:58.738 --> 11:00.672
The ideal is within four.

11:00.740 --> 11:04.403
We're racing FOX,
CNN, <i>Drudge Report,</i> what-have-you.

11:04.477 --> 11:07.537
Not to mention any soldier
with a cell phone or a webcam.

11:07.613 --> 11:09.945
The whole point is we gotta be first.

11:10.016 --> 11:11.506
So, if you're in bed...

11:11.584 --> 11:16.419
...or church or the ballet,
this baby stays on.

11:18.424 --> 11:19.857
Yes, sir.

11:25.498 --> 11:26.988
Tried and true.

11:27.066 --> 11:31.162
A long battery life too. Can't be beat.

11:35.141 --> 11:36.733
I know what you're thinking.

11:36.809 --> 11:40.506
You're thinking...
"Shit, I'm a goddamn decorated war hero...

11:40.580 --> 11:44.516
with three months left to serve and they
draft me into the Angels of Death squadron.

11:44.584 --> 11:47.951
I get a beeper, a canned speech...

11:48.021 --> 11:52.458
...and a lunatic commanding officer
to surf a fucking ocean of grief. "

11:53.426 --> 11:54.916
Am I right?

11:54.994 --> 11:58.521
More or less, sir. Am I right?

12:45.678 --> 12:47.737
It's the middle of the fucking night!

12:47.814 --> 12:49.805
Turn that fucking music off!

13:14.907 --> 13:16.397
There's your problem.

13:17.310 --> 13:19.335
Attention to detail, Private!

13:22.281 --> 13:24.146
Read the fucking manual!

13:24.217 --> 13:28.017
You have 130-degree heat.
You have sand blasting.

13:28.087 --> 13:30.453
It's baked the hose
right under the housing.

13:30.523 --> 13:32.514
Break the suction.

13:34.026 --> 13:36.859
Every second you're
on the side of the road...

13:36.929 --> 13:39.693
...increases your chances of getting shot...

13:39.765 --> 13:41.699
...your boys shot, your boys blown up.

13:41.767 --> 13:44.668
No haji armor's gonna protect you.

13:44.737 --> 13:47.968
Plus you're fucking up
a five billion dollar a week operation...

13:48.040 --> 13:51.373
...because you don't have
a 25 cent cooling hose.

13:51.444 --> 13:53.969
So you think ahead.
You have 10 in the back.

13:54.046 --> 13:56.241
You think ahead. You prepare.
You think ahead.

14:04.423 --> 14:07.881
Yeah, well, should be
in the next couple blocks.

14:08.628 --> 14:10.562
We should just ask someone.

14:10.630 --> 14:11.688
No.

14:12.765 --> 14:16.724
First of all, men don't ask for directions,
much less soldiers.

14:17.436 --> 14:22.965
Soldiers on a notification, definitely,
positively do not ask for freaking directions.

14:23.643 --> 14:27.545
No GPS. No MapQuest. We navigate.

14:28.614 --> 14:31.947
Second, you never wanna park too close.

14:32.018 --> 14:36.751
They hear a car park, go to the window,
see two soldiers getting out...

14:36.822 --> 14:38.790
...it's just a minute of torture.

14:40.793 --> 14:44.024
Now I should warn you
some of them do have guns.

14:47.433 --> 14:49.993
Knocking is ominous,
but ringing is jarring.

14:50.069 --> 14:53.334
Or worse, sometimes you get one of those
god-awful chirping doorbells...

14:53.406 --> 14:56.204
...some singsongy shit throws
you right off your game.

14:56.275 --> 14:59.506
<i>Yankee Doodle went to town</i>
<i>A ridin'on a pony</i>

14:59.579 --> 15:02.548
And "Sorry your husband is dead"
doesn't flow. So I knock.

15:02.615 --> 15:05.550
I don't really like to say good morning
or good afternoon either.

15:05.618 --> 15:07.745
There ain't nothing good about it.

15:07.820 --> 15:11.312
I used to introduce myself, that's standard,
but now I think it's rude.

15:11.390 --> 15:14.291
It ain't about me. Lose the shades.

15:29.809 --> 15:32.300
We're looking for Mrs. Tina Burrell.
Is she in?

15:34.513 --> 15:37.949
Is Leroy in trouble again?
I'm his girlfriend.

15:38.017 --> 15:40.645
We need to speak with Mrs. Burrell.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.348
Okay, Come in. Come in.

15:50.630 --> 15:52.564
Please, sit down.

15:53.866 --> 15:55.458
I just made some tea.

15:57.336 --> 15:58.826
Do you want some?

16:00.906 --> 16:02.737
Ma'am, could you please get Mrs. Burrell?

16:02.808 --> 16:06.244
Yeah, she's down the block. She just called.
She'll be back in a minute.

16:10.783 --> 16:12.717
I thought you said we don't wait.

16:14.854 --> 16:17.186
If she's not here in 30 seconds,
we're gone.

16:18.991 --> 16:20.083
Sit.

16:21.560 --> 16:24.393
I'm Monica. I'm Leroy's girlfriend.

16:27.667 --> 16:30.227
And this is his baby. He's a boy.

16:30.303 --> 16:34.296
But he don't know that yet, so don't tell
him because I ain't calling him Junior.

16:34.373 --> 16:36.807
<i>Two cell phones.</i>

16:36.876 --> 16:41.279
<i>One was $209.75, and the other...</i>

16:41.347 --> 16:42.871
What did he do?

16:44.550 --> 16:47.644
I'm sorry, ma'am. Our orders
are to speak with Mrs. Burrell.

16:47.720 --> 16:50.314
Well, I am too. I mean, I was gonna be.

16:50.389 --> 16:53.756
We were supposed to get married, but then
my father got laid off and...

16:54.660 --> 16:58.619
Look, I know Leroy's always saying
the wrong thing, but he's a good man.

17:00.499 --> 17:02.364
Please, just tell me.

17:02.435 --> 17:04.925
<i>I got an envelope</i>
<i>with these sheets of paper.</i>

17:05.003 --> 17:06.938
<i>Could I see those papers, please?</i>

17:07.006 --> 17:08.997
We'll be back.

17:09.075 --> 17:13.171
<i>You sent her the money and this envelope</i>
<i>came with these two pictures...</i>

17:13.244 --> 17:15.941
Sir, tell me.

17:19.952 --> 17:24.582
Oh, why? Oh, no,
please, God, no! My, God, why?

17:24.656 --> 17:28.184
- What's going...
- I have bad news, Mrs. Burrell.

17:28.260 --> 17:32.196
The Secretary of the Army has asked me to
express his deepest regret...

17:32.264 --> 17:34.994
...that your son,
Private First Class Leroy Burrell...

17:35.067 --> 17:38.230
No, no, no!
You got to go! You got to go!

17:38.304 --> 17:42.832
- I'm very sorry, Mrs. Burrell.
- No. Listen. No!

17:42.908 --> 17:46.400
That's my baby. That's my baby.

17:46.479 --> 17:48.413
We can't do this right...

17:48.481 --> 17:51.609
- Your son was killed yesterday...
- Monica... Oh, my God! My house is a mess.

17:51.684 --> 17:55.882
- A Casualty Assistance...
- No! Don't you say that about my baby!

17:55.955 --> 17:58.515
Don't you say that about my baby!

17:59.325 --> 18:01.793
- I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am.
- No! Make him go!

18:01.861 --> 18:04.830
A Casualty Assistance Officer
will contact you shortly...

18:04.897 --> 18:08.128
- To help you arrange for the funeral.
- Tell him to stop saying that!

18:18.878 --> 18:21.847
We left them with the next-door neighbor.

18:21.914 --> 18:26.351
- <i>How'd she take it?</i>
- Hard. Very hard.

18:26.419 --> 18:28.353
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Yep.

18:28.421 --> 18:31.083
<i>We'll be there by 1000 hours.</i>

18:31.157 --> 18:33.125
All right, thanks. Good luck.

18:34.493 --> 18:36.461
CAO is on the way.

18:40.733 --> 18:43.361
No such thing as a satisfied customer.

18:43.436 --> 18:46.963
Ice cream! Ice cream!
Ice cream! Ice cream!

18:47.106 --> 18:49.267
Double whiskey, please.

18:49.341 --> 18:52.936
- Hot water and lemon?
- And a glass of ice.

18:58.217 --> 19:00.811
I'm in AA, if you're asking.

19:02.054 --> 19:06.684
Been sober three years. Mind you, I never
drank anything stronger than pop.

19:06.759 --> 19:10.160
Of course, my pop would drink
just about anything.

19:19.271 --> 19:21.569
Oh, they tell them to get ready
when their kids deploy...

19:21.640 --> 19:24.006
...but they never really listen, do they?

19:24.076 --> 19:29.480
Soldiers go to war
and everyone waves flags and applauds...

19:29.548 --> 19:34.884
...look at charts, study strategies,
have "informed opinions. "

19:34.954 --> 19:39.584
And then bullets fly and soldiers die
and it's such a shock.

19:39.658 --> 19:44.061
Fuck that! What did they think
it was gonna be like, <i>Fear Factor?</i>

19:46.065 --> 19:49.159
- Where'd you see action?
- Desert Storm/Desert Shield.

19:49.235 --> 19:53.934
Never got a crack at Enduring Freedom
or Iraqi Freedom, much to my chagrin.

19:55.374 --> 19:57.604
Wasn't much of a war, but...

19:59.478 --> 20:01.378
I got my baptism too.

20:02.047 --> 20:04.914
You weren't the only one getting shot at.

20:14.760 --> 20:17.126
So they say you saved your buddies.

20:25.104 --> 20:27.038
You want to know what I think?

20:27.106 --> 20:32.408
I think they ought to show
every goddamn funeral on TV, live.

20:32.478 --> 20:36.278
Have the president come
around from time to time and eulogize...

20:36.348 --> 20:39.579
...the vice president, get people used to it.

20:39.652 --> 20:41.916
I mean, are we at war or not?

20:46.825 --> 20:48.486
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

20:48.561 --> 20:52.327
- Let me know if you guys need anything else.
- Oh, you know it already, Emily.

20:57.903 --> 21:01.634
I'd like to strap her on and wear her like
a government-issue gas mask.

21:01.707 --> 21:05.165
- I got my sights on her, so don't even go there.
- Roger that.

21:07.813 --> 21:11.749
Lfigure I could play
the sensitivity card.

21:11.817 --> 21:14.285
Tell her what my day was like
down in death valley.

21:14.353 --> 21:18.119
Then again, sympathy backfires...

21:18.190 --> 21:20.158
...she'll never leave.

21:20.225 --> 21:23.922
Trust me, I've been married three times.
Twice to the same woman.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.930
So now you know what the mission is.

21:31.003 --> 21:32.095
Yeah.

21:33.939 --> 21:35.930
Hey, if you're not cut out for it...

21:36.008 --> 21:37.669
...you're not cut out for it.

21:44.783 --> 21:46.307
So you have a girl?

21:49.088 --> 21:50.749
You got to think about it?

21:52.091 --> 21:53.388
Kelly.

21:54.460 --> 21:56.985
We were together
since we were little kids.

21:57.062 --> 21:59.189
Then when I was deployed, everything...

21:59.264 --> 22:01.164
She wanted you to commit, you balked...

22:01.233 --> 22:05.499
...and the minute you were gone,
Jody plunked his ass down in the La-Z-Boy.

22:05.571 --> 22:07.539
You probably dodged a bullet.

22:08.440 --> 22:11.500
The only reason to get married like that
is the extra pay.

22:11.577 --> 22:13.704
Cut them in, then cut them loose.

22:15.080 --> 22:18.914
Of course, they can always get pregnant
and bleed you dry.

22:19.785 --> 22:21.275
It's too easy.

22:21.353 --> 22:25.255
I just told her she was free.
I didn't want you knocking on her door.

22:30.362 --> 22:34.890
Yeah, well.
Anyway, lot of Shellys out there.

22:36.068 --> 22:37.228
Kelly.

22:43.509 --> 22:47.036
You know, up to Vietnam,
they used send a telegram.

22:48.113 --> 22:50.377
If it was your wife, what would she want?

22:51.784 --> 22:54.344
<i>Why don't you just kill me,</i>
<i>you son of a bitchl</i>

22:54.420 --> 22:57.651
Yeah! Come on! Come on!

23:55.280 --> 23:56.770
<i>Hey, that was quick.</i>

23:56.849 --> 24:01.309
Are you awake?
Just making sure you're on your toes.

24:01.386 --> 24:04.082
- <i>Is this a joke, sir?</i>
- No, no. I just...

24:05.457 --> 24:10.087
You know, since I stopped drinking,
I stay up nights...

24:11.063 --> 24:12.928
...especially after notifying someone.

24:15.567 --> 24:20.971
<i>So you think you might stay on</i>
<i>after your enlistment's up?</i>

24:21.039 --> 24:22.028
<i>I mean...</i>

24:22.107 --> 24:23.734
...hell, you...

24:25.077 --> 24:28.877
What's your e-mail anyway? Do you I M?

24:28.947 --> 24:31.040
<i>I don't have a computer.</i>

24:31.116 --> 24:34.313
Really? How does that work?

24:36.622 --> 24:38.180
Hey, you're funny.

24:38.257 --> 24:41.454
- <i>What?</i>
- You calling my beeper.

24:41.527 --> 24:44.860
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Oh, shit.</i>

24:44.930 --> 24:47.125
<i>Get ready. I'll meet you on post.</i>

24:58.076 --> 24:59.566
What's going on?

24:59.645 --> 25:01.670
You gotta get out of here.

25:04.783 --> 25:08.981
Don't look at me like that. I gotta go,
so you gotta go. Come on, let's go.

25:11.390 --> 25:13.324
I don't get it. You married or something?

25:14.092 --> 25:19.689
No, no. I just got... work.

25:19.765 --> 25:22.632
Work? In the middle of the night
all of a sudden?

25:22.701 --> 25:25.795
What the do you do? Deliver babies?

25:30.275 --> 25:34.837
Dale Martin. Dale Martin. Dale. Dale.

25:34.880 --> 25:39.044
Specialist Eric Martin, killed in action...

25:39.084 --> 25:41.917
- I got it covered.
- I'm doing this one.

25:41.954 --> 25:44.013
...in southern Iraq...
- It's okay. I'll do it.

25:44.089 --> 25:46.683
I'm assigned to do something,
I'm going to do it, sir.

25:47.426 --> 25:50.953
Specialist Eric Martin, southern Iraq.

25:51.029 --> 25:54.931
Well, okay. It's a man this time.

25:57.469 --> 25:58.663
So?

26:00.439 --> 26:04.637
Men try harder to keep it together.
They're also the ones that can hurt you.

26:04.710 --> 26:06.644
<i>You cannot be a burden to taxpayersl</i>

26:06.712 --> 26:09.647
- <i>You're not entitled to welfare...</i>
- I'm doing this.

26:09.715 --> 26:12.309
<i>... Assistance that comes</i>
<i>in any way out of my pocket.</i>

26:12.384 --> 26:14.409
Well, then, reach down in your pants...

26:14.486 --> 26:17.717
...grab a double handful of balls
and do it right.

26:17.789 --> 26:20.417
<i>Freeloader, got itl You can come here</i>
<i>if you can invest here...</i>

26:20.492 --> 26:23.017
<i>around, let's say, 50 times</i>
<i>the current minimum wage.</i>

26:23.095 --> 26:25.086
<i>If you can do that, ha, comel</i>

27:07.105 --> 27:08.299
Let's go.

27:10.742 --> 27:11.936
Let's go.

27:19.618 --> 27:20.915
Excuse me?

27:22.854 --> 27:24.151
Mr. Martin?

27:24.957 --> 27:26.424
Oh, shit!

27:26.491 --> 27:28.584
Dale Martin?

27:29.261 --> 27:32.890
The Secretary of the Army
has asked me to express his deep regret...

27:32.965 --> 27:37.868
...that your son, Specialist Eric Martin,
was killed in action yesterday...

27:37.936 --> 27:40.803
...in southern Iraq by sniper fire.

27:40.872 --> 27:43.864
You will receive a more complete report
as soon as possible, sir.

27:43.942 --> 27:48.572
What we can tell you right now is that his
platoon came under sniper fire...

27:49.648 --> 27:52.242
...and it was an instant death.

27:54.953 --> 27:56.443
I'm so sorry.

28:00.659 --> 28:02.422
Look at that tree.

28:04.329 --> 28:06.456
I said look at that fucking tree.

28:08.633 --> 28:10.726
It's the same age as my son.

28:16.842 --> 28:20.539
"If I don't go,
who's gonna go in place of me?"

28:20.612 --> 28:22.102
That's what he said.

28:25.650 --> 28:28.585
A Casualty Assistance Officer
will contact you in four hours...

28:28.653 --> 28:30.951
- Fucking bastards!
- Will notify you in...

28:33.191 --> 28:35.125
Will notify you in four hours.

28:35.193 --> 28:37.627
Is there a neighbor
or a friend or a family member...

28:37.696 --> 28:40.358
- You fucking idiot!
- That can come and help you in your trying time?

28:42.167 --> 28:43.759
Why aren't you there?

28:46.038 --> 28:47.528
Why aren't you dead?

28:50.142 --> 28:52.576
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Why aren't you there now?

28:54.746 --> 28:56.839
- I'm sorry.
- Fucking cowards.

28:56.915 --> 28:59.850
- Let's go.
- I don't care if you're fucking sorry!

28:59.918 --> 29:01.579
We're done here.

29:01.653 --> 29:03.814
Don't you fucking say you're sorry to me.

29:06.425 --> 29:08.586
You want to tell his mother?

29:08.660 --> 29:11.128
Are you gonna tell his mother?

29:11.196 --> 29:13.426
He's fucking 20 years old!

29:15.200 --> 29:16.394
Keep walking.

29:20.038 --> 29:21.665
- You fucking coward!
- Keep walking.

29:21.740 --> 29:23.867
- I said...
- I don't fucking care!

29:23.942 --> 29:27.639
Sergeant,
he touches you again, I'll handle it.

29:27.712 --> 29:30.272
What? Fucking handle what?

29:32.117 --> 29:33.982
You'll fucking handle what?

29:35.787 --> 29:37.778
You fucking cowards!

30:08.286 --> 30:11.847
Well, I guess one way or another
we're all God's children.

30:17.262 --> 30:19.492
It's all fortune cookies to me, sir.

30:33.345 --> 30:35.336
I'm not really happy with these drops.

30:35.413 --> 30:39.042
I'm gonna prescribe something else.

30:43.455 --> 30:45.116
What's the doctor saying about the leg?

30:45.190 --> 30:48.523
It's getting better. Though but I'm sort
of rooting for the eye.

30:49.928 --> 30:51.452
It's not a race.

30:52.130 --> 30:54.325
Polytrauma takes a lot of patience.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.699
The body parts are literally
on different schedules.

31:00.705 --> 31:04.368
"And all the king's horses
and all the king's men... " How does it go?

31:07.212 --> 31:09.874
"Couldn't put Humpty back together again. "

31:20.292 --> 31:22.089
<i>Kelly's phone. This is Alan.</i>

31:33.538 --> 31:35.233
<i>Answer off.</i>

31:57.395 --> 31:58.885
Shit.

32:00.899 --> 32:03.060
- Son of a bitch.
- <i>... For sentencing tomorrow.</i>

32:03.134 --> 32:06.160
<i>We'll keep you posted.</i>
<i>And the State Supreme Court...</i>

32:12.911 --> 32:16.039
Don't say anything. I'll do the talking.

32:22.821 --> 32:23.947
Sergeant.

32:24.823 --> 32:26.984
- License and registration.
- What'd I do?

32:27.859 --> 32:30.384
You went through a red light
about a half a mile back.

32:30.462 --> 32:33.397
- It was yellow.
- It was red when he went through it.

32:33.465 --> 32:35.865
- It's an emergency.
- What kind of emergency?

32:35.934 --> 32:38.994
A soldier died.
We're going to notify the widow.

32:39.771 --> 32:42.205
- That's not an emergency.
- It's about timing.

32:42.274 --> 32:43.764
You know that.

32:43.842 --> 32:46.606
Yeah, well, you get into a wreck
on your way to a notification...

32:46.678 --> 32:49.647
...you kill somebody, you get yourself killed,
how's that gonna feel?

32:49.714 --> 32:51.705
That's a jackass move.

32:51.783 --> 32:53.717
- Can you believe this shit?
- Excuse me?

32:53.785 --> 32:55.412
No, he's right. He's right.

33:01.626 --> 33:03.617
I don't want to do this anyway.

33:04.963 --> 33:06.555
You want to do it?

33:10.035 --> 33:14.495
Go to this address,
her name is Olivia Pitterson.

33:14.572 --> 33:17.405
Knock on her door
and break her little heart.

33:18.743 --> 33:20.734
Fuck it.
Well, let's pretend it didn't happen.

33:20.812 --> 33:25.647
Let her find out that he got blown up
from some kid at the local news desk.

33:25.717 --> 33:29.346
Let him put her on hold, 'cause you don't
give a fuck about her, do you?

33:29.421 --> 33:33.619
No. No! You are just doing your job.

33:43.968 --> 33:45.492
Get the hell out of here.

34:19.637 --> 34:22.161
- All right. Hey!
- Yeah, me too.

34:22.239 --> 34:24.208
Last one's is ready!

34:24.275 --> 34:26.368
Pretty high up, isn't it, huh?

34:40.992 --> 34:43.255
Could be worse.

34:43.328 --> 34:45.353
It could be Christmas.

34:49.868 --> 34:51.335
Jesus.

35:04.082 --> 35:07.415
Mrs. Pitterson? Mrs. Pitterson.

35:09.287 --> 35:10.811
Are you Mrs. Pitterson?

35:13.758 --> 35:15.623
How did it happen?

35:18.062 --> 35:20.292
Did anyone talk with you already, ma'am?

35:22.367 --> 35:24.062
How did he die?

35:25.703 --> 35:30.140
He was killed in action yesterday
in the city of Mosul.

35:30.208 --> 35:32.233
That's all the information
we have now, ma'am.

35:32.310 --> 35:37.111
But the Secretary of the Army
extends his deepest sympathy to you...

35:37.182 --> 35:38.945
There's no need.

35:45.490 --> 35:46.718
But...

35:50.328 --> 35:53.695
I would ask you in, but my little boy...

35:56.434 --> 35:58.800
Am I supposed to call Phil's parents?

36:00.705 --> 36:02.866
Not unless you want to, ma'am.

36:02.941 --> 36:06.741
Your husband's DD-93 has you
listed as the primary NOK...

36:06.811 --> 36:09.143
...and them as secondary.

36:09.214 --> 36:13.173
They moved to Florida.
Is that still accurate?

36:13.251 --> 36:14.445
Yes.

36:17.088 --> 36:20.182
A local notification team
has been alerted...

36:20.258 --> 36:24.058
...and they're waiting for us
to give them the go-ahead.

36:24.128 --> 36:28.497
Okay, thanks a lot. Good-bye.

36:28.566 --> 36:32.002
The Casualty Assistance Officer
will contact you shortly...

36:32.070 --> 36:34.800
...to help make arrangements for the funeral.

36:34.873 --> 36:36.738
Okay. Thanks.

36:38.943 --> 36:40.137
Good-bye.

36:41.112 --> 36:46.573
Ma'am, would you like us
to notify your child?

36:49.320 --> 36:50.514
What?

36:51.723 --> 36:55.750
No, no. I can tell my little boy.

36:57.629 --> 37:01.156
Okay, good-bye.
I know this can't be easy for you.

37:05.470 --> 37:09.873
- If you have any further questions, just...
- No. No. No, thanks.

37:31.262 --> 37:32.422
Sergeant!

37:38.503 --> 37:43.497
"I know this can't be easy for you. "
Can you believe that?

37:44.275 --> 37:45.799
That's a first.

37:48.279 --> 37:51.976
She's banging someone.
You see the shirt she was hanging?

37:54.352 --> 37:59.790
Her husband dies 10,000 miles away,
she's got a man on the clothesline already.

38:04.429 --> 38:08.763
Hey, we getting in this vehicle
sometime today?

38:08.833 --> 38:12.360
We walk into these people's lives,
we don't know shit.

38:12.437 --> 38:13.426
Trust me.

38:13.504 --> 38:15.062
You don't want to know.

38:19.277 --> 38:20.437
Come on.

38:24.515 --> 38:28.781
From now on we take the silver bullet.
Your wheels are crap.

38:40.999 --> 38:43.160
Why are you giving me pancakes?

38:43.234 --> 38:45.702
'Cause you're my baby and I love you.

38:47.238 --> 38:48.705
What's wrong?

39:14.999 --> 39:17.092
You going to pretend you don't have one?

39:18.036 --> 39:20.698
I know you have her picture.

39:20.772 --> 39:23.138
I'm willing to bet the next round on it.

39:30.882 --> 39:32.873
What have we here?

39:34.752 --> 39:35.741
Nice.

39:37.021 --> 39:39.012
You can afford the next round.

39:46.230 --> 39:47.254
Nice.

39:47.331 --> 39:50.027
Very nice. Table grade.

39:50.101 --> 39:52.729
I could slop her up with a biscuit.

39:52.804 --> 39:55.238
Yeah, well, she has
a very serious boyfriend.

39:55.306 --> 39:59.675
No, I don't buy it. Not this girl.
There's nothing serious about her.

40:00.511 --> 40:05.073
She's having a ball down in Nowheresville
while you pine for her.

40:06.617 --> 40:08.141
You still got her number?

40:15.059 --> 40:17.050
Oh, wait. Hey, hey.

40:17.128 --> 40:18.425
Come here.

40:19.497 --> 40:21.692
Sit. Will you sit?

40:22.400 --> 40:27.963
Listen, I thought we had
a great time the other night.

40:28.039 --> 40:31.497
You were amazing, as was I...

40:31.576 --> 40:36.479
...and I'm sorry I had to go,
but tonight's another night.

40:37.181 --> 40:39.149
I'm pregnant.

40:43.554 --> 40:45.419
I'm just fucking with you.

40:46.324 --> 40:48.952
- Have a good life.
- A good life.

40:49.026 --> 40:50.891
Hey, you got my hopes up.

40:57.602 --> 41:02.130
A glass of ice, hot water, lemon.

41:02.206 --> 41:03.696
Paid in full.

41:07.645 --> 41:09.169
I think I'm gonna head out.

41:11.048 --> 41:12.538
Where you going?

41:14.085 --> 41:18.021
- I'm gonna go home.
- What for? Internet porn?

41:18.956 --> 41:21.789
Come on, you don't even have a computer.

41:21.859 --> 41:22.985
What...

41:24.061 --> 41:26.962
I was bullshitting. No, stay.

41:29.600 --> 41:33.161
Forget women.
We'll talk about something else, right?

41:35.173 --> 41:36.697
Sleep when you're dead.

41:37.375 --> 41:39.366
What's your deal?

41:39.443 --> 41:41.707
Your folks around?

41:50.188 --> 41:51.780
My father's gone.

41:53.124 --> 41:56.218
My mom's a... Nut.

41:56.928 --> 41:58.793
I haven't seen her in years.

41:59.463 --> 42:02.364
Another lost child
looking for family, huh?

42:03.301 --> 42:04.791
I guess so.

42:09.173 --> 42:10.663
Why did you join?

42:11.742 --> 42:13.767
- A dare.
- A dare?

42:13.845 --> 42:15.335
Why are you still here?

42:15.413 --> 42:18.905
Well, they offered me a commission
and no one dared me to leave.

42:25.489 --> 42:27.855
And I dare you to stay.

42:32.430 --> 42:36.799
Hey, we're not gonna lie to you... Iraq,
Afghanistan... wherever we go next, hostile.

42:38.569 --> 42:40.059
Hey, it's crazy, but it's real.

42:40.137 --> 42:43.436
Hey, the army's hard work. Fighting terrorists,
rebuilding countries, saving lives.

42:43.507 --> 42:44.997
And risking our lives?

42:45.076 --> 42:46.976
I don't have to remind you
how many Americans lost their lives...

42:47.044 --> 42:48.841
...just showing up for work
one morning in September, do I?

42:48.913 --> 42:50.778
- That's right.
- No, I didn't think so.

42:50.848 --> 42:52.873
Shoot, there's risk in the army,
there's risk in life.

42:52.950 --> 42:54.850
But we're talking about rewards here...

42:54.919 --> 42:57.513
...and we're talking about
a feeling that you can get...

42:57.588 --> 43:01.752
...but not from flinging hot dogs at a ball game
or bagging groceries at a supermarket.

43:01.826 --> 43:04.386
We're talking about honor and discipline.

43:04.462 --> 43:06.555
- Self-respect.
- Thank you.

43:06.631 --> 43:08.189
I just wanna fuck some shit up.

43:08.266 --> 43:10.734
- That does come with the job sometimes.
- Oh, come on.

43:10.801 --> 43:12.701
You have any sort of skills
you want to bring to the army?

43:12.770 --> 43:14.328
Leave them alone.
They're just kids.

43:14.405 --> 43:16.600
Oh, ma'am, these young men
want to serve their country.

43:16.674 --> 43:19.336
- They're here by their free will.
- Oh, do you want to take a look?

43:19.410 --> 43:21.571
- You want to take a look at this, see?
- Okay, ma'am...

43:21.646 --> 43:23.580
- You want to guess what it's for?
- Ma'am...

43:23.648 --> 43:26.242
There's a sticker on my husband's coffin
that says "remains unviewable. "

43:26.317 --> 43:28.285
- Ma'am, we're very sorry...
- Nice big tall boys like you.

43:28.352 --> 43:30.820
- And what's left could fit in a shoe box.
- I understand you're upset.

43:30.888 --> 43:33.118
- Why don't you calm down?
- Ma'am, why don't you take your son home...

43:33.190 --> 43:35.681
Why don't you take your son home
and calm down?

43:35.760 --> 43:38.820
Why don't you go home? In fact, why
doesn't everybody just go home?

43:38.896 --> 43:40.830
- That's right go home!
- We're all in this together.

43:40.898 --> 43:43.628
- Sergeant. Take a walk.
- Why doesn't everybody just go home?

43:43.701 --> 43:45.635
- Yes, sir.
- You guys know where to find us.

43:45.703 --> 43:47.796
- What are you looking at? Just go home!
- You okay?

43:48.806 --> 43:49.795
Yeah.

43:49.874 --> 43:53.605
- Do you need anything?
- What? No, thank you.

43:54.545 --> 43:56.536
I'm sorry, sweetheart. Come on.

44:04.288 --> 44:05.983
- Come on.
- I hate this suit!

44:06.057 --> 44:09.083
Pick it up.
I've asked you to pick that up.

44:09.160 --> 44:10.957
Pick it up. Now.

44:13.564 --> 44:15.054
Do not do that.

44:30.381 --> 44:32.281
I was getting a prescription...

44:34.485 --> 44:35.975
...at the mall.

44:37.722 --> 44:39.952
And that's why I was at the mall.

44:40.925 --> 44:43.257
I have this eye...

44:43.928 --> 44:47.830
I gotta get... Take drops... For...

44:50.968 --> 44:54.267
It's okay now? Is it okay now?

44:56.207 --> 44:57.299
Yeah.

45:00.478 --> 45:06.212
Gets dry. It's kinda... Spotty.

45:39.683 --> 45:42.777
You'll need a new transmission soon.

45:43.954 --> 45:45.478
Can I pay you something?

45:45.556 --> 45:46.818
No.

45:50.227 --> 45:52.957
I should get a new car
at some point, but...

45:53.631 --> 45:57.590
...it just feels wrong,
you know, with the new money.

46:01.238 --> 46:02.728
Do you play?

46:04.141 --> 46:06.075
No.

46:06.143 --> 46:07.770
I work at Lock and Keep.

46:09.280 --> 46:11.976
It's a storage space
on Third Street and Battalion.

46:13.017 --> 46:17.511
You know, sometimes people
leave things behind. Nice things.

46:17.588 --> 46:20.648
A new mattress, coffee table...

46:20.724 --> 46:23.659
...framed pictures of strangers.

46:30.534 --> 46:32.297
I'm gonna get going.

46:34.738 --> 46:36.296
Thanks for your help.

46:36.373 --> 46:38.773
Yeah. Get a new transmission.

46:38.843 --> 46:39.935
Soon.

46:41.011 --> 46:42.273
Seriously.

46:45.716 --> 46:47.206
Thanks for the ride.

46:54.558 --> 46:56.219
Thanks. Bye.

47:10.141 --> 47:12.132
That's it! Yeah, come on!

47:26.957 --> 47:28.219
Yeah!

47:31.795 --> 47:33.626
That's not what I said.

47:33.664 --> 47:35.894
But you are trying to fuck her,
aren't you?

47:35.966 --> 47:39.129
I'm not trying anything, sir.
Lfixed her car.

47:39.937 --> 47:43.429
You saw the shirt.
She's got someone.

47:43.507 --> 47:44.633
Who?

47:45.509 --> 47:47.374
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

47:50.748 --> 47:53.478
Jesus, why is it always the quiet ones?

47:55.186 --> 47:57.518
Where are your morals, hero?

47:58.522 --> 48:02.788
It's just too easy. You bring her her husband's
death and then you try to fuck her.

48:04.395 --> 48:09.230
And by the way, if she's into you,
she's into some really weird twists.

48:09.300 --> 48:12.997
She's a real head case.
You've been warned.

48:13.070 --> 48:15.698
Thank you, sir.
I will make a note of that.

48:21.946 --> 48:26.974
I bet her husband couldn't wait to get
away from her and back in theater.

48:27.051 --> 48:29.485
<i>For Central, a stalled</i>
<i>car blocking the middle lane.</i>

48:29.553 --> 48:31.418
<i>Traffic slowing down from...</i>

48:35.326 --> 48:37.556
We're here to speak with Mrs. Galindo.

48:40.798 --> 48:42.595
What, this some kind of joke?

48:44.168 --> 48:46.728
- No, sir.
- There's no Mrs. Galindo here.

48:46.804 --> 48:50.535
- Marla Galindo? Are you saying she moved or...
- Hold it. Marla!

48:52.977 --> 48:54.467
Marla!

49:00.951 --> 49:02.885
- Marla!
- What?

49:02.953 --> 49:04.978
- I'm so tired of this shit from you.
- What? What did I do?

49:05.055 --> 49:08.115
There are a couple of soldiers downstairs.
They're asking for a Mrs. Galindo.

49:08.192 --> 49:10.683
Dad, we were gonna, but I...

49:10.761 --> 49:12.888
Tell me what? What are you talking about?

49:12.963 --> 49:15.124
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What's going on?

49:15.199 --> 49:16.689
We were gonna tell you, but I...

49:16.767 --> 49:19.201
I knew how you felt and there
was just so little time before...

49:19.270 --> 49:21.295
- What, you married that little greaseball?
- Please, don't call him that!

49:21.372 --> 49:23.306
- You always do that!
- Mrs. Galindo...

49:23.374 --> 49:25.308
Hold it! I'm dealing with
some family stuff here!

49:25.376 --> 49:27.503
- Could you step outside?
- Just let them say what they need to say!

49:27.578 --> 49:29.944
- I have bad news for you, Mrs. Galindo.
- Just leave us for a second?

49:30.014 --> 49:34.212
Your husband, Corporal Mario Galindo,
was killed last night in Iraq...

49:34.285 --> 49:37.584
...by an improvised explosive device.

49:37.655 --> 49:41.989
The Secretary of the Army has asked me
to express his deepest sympathy to you.

49:43.527 --> 49:47.759
A Casualty Assistance Officer
will contact you in the next few hours.

49:59.443 --> 50:02.537
- We're very sorry for your loss, ma'am.
- All right, all right.

50:10.821 --> 50:12.448
Daddy.

50:13.624 --> 50:15.922
- I'm so sorry.
- I know. I know.

50:15.993 --> 50:19.827
I was gonna tell you. I'm... I'm...

50:21.999 --> 50:24.399
Here's a good one! Here's a good one!

50:24.468 --> 50:28.302
So this tribal chief, he's this
old-looking guy, I figured he's around 50.

50:28.372 --> 50:30.363
Maybe older. Maybe 60.

50:30.441 --> 50:33.274
His face is all sagging and fucking gray.

50:33.344 --> 50:35.039
He's got a bunch of teeth missing.

50:35.112 --> 50:36.739
The guy's got fucking scurvy.

50:36.814 --> 50:39.044
All kinds of, you know, desert shit.

50:39.116 --> 50:41.414
We called him Haji-Wan Kenobi.

50:41.485 --> 50:44.420
So he tells me he's not used to making
deals like this with a kid.

50:44.488 --> 50:46.422
So I tell him, "Hey, man, I'm 28."

50:46.490 --> 50:48.424
Twenty-nine next month.

50:48.492 --> 50:51.427
Yeah, I'm no kid, gramps.
But then, so, the chief says...

50:51.495 --> 50:54.555
"Twenty-eight?
You can't be 28. You're a beautiful man.

50:54.631 --> 50:56.792
You must be 20, 21."

50:56.867 --> 51:01.634
I'm thinking, what is he talking about?
What is this? What is this, he likes me?

51:01.705 --> 51:05.266
He wants to get in my pants? But the guy,
he's getting all depressed.

51:05.342 --> 51:08.470
He starts saying, " This country's shit.
This country's cursed. "

51:08.545 --> 51:10.775
I try to tell him,
"Hey, man, it ain't that bad...

51:10.848 --> 51:13.373
...since we came in
and liberated your sandy asses. "

51:13.450 --> 51:15.645
And then he goes...
And then he goes, " Not that bad?

51:15.719 --> 51:18.017
Look at me. I'm 27!"

51:19.723 --> 51:22.749
It's all the goat fucking, man!

51:22.826 --> 51:26.455
The poor asshole. He got one here,
a couple here, one went through his chest.

51:26.530 --> 51:28.794
You could almost hear the lungs
deflate, like, swoosh.

51:28.866 --> 51:30.959
One of his own men did it.

51:32.169 --> 51:34.034
Anyway, he was a funny guy.

51:35.372 --> 51:37.806
Haji-Wan Kenobi.

51:37.875 --> 51:39.433
I liked him.

51:44.148 --> 51:46.446
What's going on?
What is this? A funeral all of a sudden?

51:53.290 --> 51:54.780
I'll be right back.

52:17.147 --> 52:18.637
You okay?

52:19.716 --> 52:21.741
Yeah, sure.

52:21.819 --> 52:24.447
Night. Good night, guys. See you Monday.

52:24.521 --> 52:26.250
See you Monday.

52:34.531 --> 52:36.692
It's like coming back from another planet.

52:39.870 --> 52:41.497
What are you talking about, man?

52:42.239 --> 52:43.501
I'm fine.

52:44.842 --> 52:46.104
I'm fine.

52:48.579 --> 52:50.103
I'm home, baby.

52:54.918 --> 52:56.886
I'm fucking home, sweet home.

53:00.624 --> 53:03.991
Every American generation
has to have a war, you know.

53:04.061 --> 53:08.998
We just need it. Because we gotta use up
our weapons, so we can make more. Easy.

53:09.066 --> 53:12.763
And we gotta take warriors through wars
so they can command the next batch.

53:12.836 --> 53:14.463
Nothing wrong with that.

53:14.538 --> 53:18.167
Hey, Sergeant.
Ladies, this is the guy I told you about.

53:18.242 --> 53:21.439
Will, this is Claire and Laura.

53:21.512 --> 53:23.446
- It's Lara.
- Hey, baby.

53:23.514 --> 53:25.675
- Lara. I'm sorry.
- No.

53:25.749 --> 53:27.808
- Nice to meet you, Will.
- I'm not sure I can.

53:27.885 --> 53:30.012
Yeah, likewise, Lara.

53:30.087 --> 53:32.578
- Are you coming in?
- Yeah, in a minute.

53:32.656 --> 53:34.783
- I'm buying.
- I'll be in.

53:34.858 --> 53:37.053
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Ladies.

53:37.127 --> 53:39.595
Everybody's all fucking concerned.

53:43.400 --> 53:45.595
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

53:47.271 --> 53:50.729
Ready, aim, fire!

53:51.441 --> 53:53.705
Ready, aim...

53:53.777 --> 53:56.109
...fire! Ready.

53:56.179 --> 53:58.739
Present arms.

54:54.104 --> 54:56.436
Excuse me.

55:35.545 --> 55:37.445
Are you Angel Vasquez?

55:39.583 --> 55:41.073
Do you speak English?

55:41.985 --> 55:43.509
No.

55:43.587 --> 55:48.524
Mr. Vasquez, the Secretary of the Army
has asked me to extend his deepest regret...

55:49.593 --> 55:52.562
...that your daughter, Patricia...

55:52.629 --> 55:55.621
was killed in a helicopter crash...

55:55.699 --> 55:59.567
...at 7:00 a. M. Our time
in the Anbar province of Iraq.

55:59.636 --> 56:03.595
You will be further advised
as more information becomes available.

56:06.510 --> 56:11.880
The Secretary of the Army
extends his deepest sympathy to you...

56:11.948 --> 56:15.384
...and your family in your tragic loss.

56:27.297 --> 56:29.492
He's asking if we're sure about it.

56:31.868 --> 56:34.462
Positive identification
has been made, sir.

56:52.989 --> 56:54.786
He's saying, "It can't be. "

56:57.594 --> 56:59.084
I'm very sorry, sir.

57:36.066 --> 57:37.658
<i>Hey, it's Kelly.</i>

57:39.436 --> 57:41.927
<i>I'm sorry I sent that invitation.</i>

57:42.606 --> 57:45.074
<i>That was really... That was really dumb.</i>

57:46.143 --> 57:48.475
<i>You know, I wanted us to be able...</i>

57:48.545 --> 57:51.241
<i>I don't know. I hope you're not mad, okay?</i>

57:53.316 --> 57:55.341
<i>You didn't RSVR, so...</i>

57:57.454 --> 58:01.823
<i>I guess, you know,</i>
<i>I was scared to tell you and...</i>

58:01.892 --> 58:03.985
<i>I don't know, there's, like,</i>
<i>all this stress.</i>

58:04.060 --> 58:07.723
<i>You know, I don't even want</i>
<i>this stupid party anyways, and his parents...</i>

58:10.867 --> 58:13.665
<i>Sorry, it's, like,</i>
<i>not even your problem.</i>

58:15.372 --> 58:16.862
<i>I'm crazy, I know.</i>

58:17.541 --> 58:20.510
<i>Alan and I got in a big fight</i>
<i>about it and...</i>

58:22.979 --> 58:24.606
<i>Don't come, okay?</i>

58:25.816 --> 58:29.775
<i>Just forget the invitation</i>
<i>and forget me. Just...</i>

58:29.853 --> 58:31.480
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

59:15.065 --> 59:16.259
Matt?

59:19.936 --> 59:21.233
Hey, pal.

59:22.839 --> 59:25.433
I bet the other kid
got it pretty good, huh?

59:27.878 --> 59:29.368
I brought you this.

59:30.981 --> 59:32.471
It was my unit's flag.

59:32.549 --> 59:35.211
I already have two.

59:35.285 --> 59:38.618
Matt, say thanks.

59:38.688 --> 59:40.155
Thanks.

59:47.731 --> 59:49.255
Thanks a lot.

59:50.066 --> 59:54.127
You know, flags and casseroles,
I can't seem to get enough of them.

59:57.073 --> 01:00:00.668
If I can... Do anything...

01:00:01.378 --> 01:00:03.938
I know where to find you.

01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:08.744
Anyway, we're leaving town.

01:00:12.822 --> 01:00:14.312
Where you going?

01:00:14.391 --> 01:00:16.621
I haven't decided. You know, it's funny.

01:00:16.693 --> 01:00:18.718
We always had to move
wherever the army sent us...

01:00:18.795 --> 01:00:21.628
...and now I don't know where to go.

01:00:21.698 --> 01:00:27.432
If you need help with any, you know,
packing boxes or putting things in boxes...

01:00:28.571 --> 01:00:31.870
You know, I can pack up
this house in a day and unpack it in two.

01:00:31.942 --> 01:00:34.172
Plenty of practice.

01:00:40.717 --> 01:00:43.277
- Thanks for the flag.
- Sure.

01:00:43.353 --> 01:00:47.221
We were thinking about
getting some pizza.

01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.799
- Can I watch TV?
- After you finish your broccoli.

01:01:03.573 --> 01:01:06.007
Mom, there's no broccoli.

01:01:12.682 --> 01:01:16.243
Oh, I must've left it on the microwave.

01:01:16.319 --> 01:01:18.685
I should probably go...

01:01:18.755 --> 01:01:21.815
...but thank you... For the pizza.

01:01:21.891 --> 01:01:24.621
And it was nice
hangin' with you, Matt.

01:01:25.962 --> 01:01:28.157
How come he doesn't
have to eat his broccoli?

01:01:32.202 --> 01:01:34.170
I could eat broccoli.

01:01:37.574 --> 01:01:39.064
I'm not eating mine.

01:01:40.677 --> 01:01:42.304
Then I'll have yours.

01:01:44.481 --> 01:01:47.109
<i>Stain Spray-Away, the only</i>
<i>instant stain remover...</i>

01:01:47.183 --> 01:01:50.414
<i>that can spray away stains</i>
<i>anywhere stains can happen.</i>

01:01:50.487 --> 01:01:53.479
<i>Worry-free Oxy-clean</i>
<i>uses the power of oxygen.</i>

01:01:53.556 --> 01:01:56.116
<i>It gently lifts stains out</i>
<i>without rubbing and scrubbing.</i>

01:01:56.192 --> 01:01:58.786
<i>You can't avoid stains</i>
<i>like coffee and ketchup...</i>

01:02:01.431 --> 01:02:03.456
<i>It's like you never got them</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

01:02:31.861 --> 01:02:33.351
Because Friday's my last day...

01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:37.161
I thought that you could
take some of this stuff, you know?

01:02:37.233 --> 01:02:39.633
It's just left here,
and it seems such a waste.

01:03:05.728 --> 01:03:07.355
Anybody looking at us right now...

01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:10.456
would say that you're a lowlife
trying to take advantage of my grief...

01:03:11.301 --> 01:03:14.737
...and that I'm a slut
and that I'm not really grieving.

01:03:25.281 --> 01:03:27.340
You ever lose anybody?

01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:31.648
Yeah.

01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:36.490
Friends, over there.

01:03:37.694 --> 01:03:40.561
My father during peacetime.

01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:42.723
A drunk driver.

01:03:43.933 --> 01:03:45.457
Did they catch him?

01:03:45.535 --> 01:03:49.301
No, my father was the drunk driver.

01:03:51.641 --> 01:03:55.236
My mom woke me up
in the middle of the night...

01:03:55.311 --> 01:04:00.374
...and she said his brakes failed.

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:06.111
Never saw her cry.

01:04:07.323 --> 01:04:10.349
But it made me
want to be a mechanic by age 10.

01:04:19.636 --> 01:04:21.695
So your mom notified you.

01:04:52.101 --> 01:04:53.591
Do you want to dance?

01:04:55.171 --> 01:04:56.798
There's no music.

01:05:35.979 --> 01:05:38.243
I'm gonna go get a shower.

01:05:41.684 --> 01:05:42.981
But why?

01:05:44.587 --> 01:05:46.282
'Cause I smell.

01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:03.664
I'm going to get a cup of coffee.
Do you want one?

01:06:14.117 --> 01:06:16.745
- Do you want a cup of coffee?
- No, thanks.

01:07:14.377 --> 01:07:17.210
I can't. I'm sorry.

01:07:18.114 --> 01:07:19.376
It's okay.

01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:31.426
When Phil reenlisted for a third tour...

01:07:33.996 --> 01:07:35.964
...it was like he needed to go.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.291
Staying home was no longer an option.

01:07:43.606 --> 01:07:45.597
I was relieved to see him go.

01:07:49.345 --> 01:07:51.677
I missed him, but I didn't...

01:07:52.749 --> 01:07:55.775
I didn't miss the guy that just left...

01:07:57.387 --> 01:08:00.914
...because I missed the man
he was a long time ago.

01:08:06.929 --> 01:08:10.296
One morning, I opened the closet...

01:08:11.601 --> 01:08:13.159
...and a shirt fell out...

01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:17.036
...and I smelled it.

01:08:18.875 --> 01:08:21.810
And it smelled awful.

01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:27.639
It smelled horrible.

01:08:29.886 --> 01:08:35.846
Not of, like, another woman
or booze or cigarettes or...

01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:42.227
It smelled of rage...

01:08:43.198 --> 01:08:44.529
...and fear.

01:08:51.774 --> 01:08:55.505
It smelled of the man
that he had become over there, you know?

01:08:58.514 --> 01:09:02.609
And he didn't treat me or his little boy
very good when he was at home.

01:09:03.853 --> 01:09:07.310
So in a way, in my mind,
it was like he was dead already.

01:09:08.024 --> 01:09:12.654
Anyway, I washed the shirt...

01:09:15.598 --> 01:09:17.189
...and then you came.

01:09:47.796 --> 01:09:49.354
I loved him once.

01:09:56.205 --> 01:10:00.437
And it's weird because now he's dead.

01:10:02.612 --> 01:10:06.070
I just... I love him again.

01:10:10.453 --> 01:10:12.387
But more for my little boy.

01:10:16.392 --> 01:10:19.020
I'm sorry. I should never
have brought you here.

01:10:20.096 --> 01:10:22.462
God, I'm sorry.

01:10:25.101 --> 01:10:26.796
Don't be.

01:10:33.209 --> 01:10:36.576
And it's not that I don't want to. I just...

01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:41.107
I know. Me too.

01:10:54.730 --> 01:10:58.131
I'm gonna go and get Matt
and pick him up early.

01:10:59.268 --> 01:11:02.635
He loves that,
and the other kids go green with envy.

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.031
Okay.

01:11:13.583 --> 01:11:14.880
Okay.

01:11:32.301 --> 01:11:34.030
Is it okay if I...

01:11:35.638 --> 01:11:38.971
...stay here for a few minutes?

01:11:43.779 --> 01:11:45.337
Sure.

01:11:45.414 --> 01:11:49.874
Just slam the door real hard.
The lock's kinda funky.

01:11:49.952 --> 01:11:51.044
Okay.

01:11:52.788 --> 01:11:53.812
Thanks.

01:12:42.271 --> 01:12:46.002
A soldier dies in a black-op mission
someplace we never admitted being...

01:12:46.042 --> 01:12:48.067
...the army calls his death an accident.

01:12:48.144 --> 01:12:50.908
Why? To protect the next one.

01:12:51.881 --> 01:12:56.079
Another soldier dies slipping into
a ditch, we call it a combat death...

01:12:56.152 --> 01:12:58.882
...just to give it a meaning.

01:12:58.954 --> 01:13:00.819
What's your point?

01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:02.084
My point?

01:13:03.526 --> 01:13:05.824
My point is that sometimes the army...

01:13:05.895 --> 01:13:09.456
...has to be concerned
with something bigger than the truth.

01:13:09.532 --> 01:13:12.092
And it's not that
they don't care about you.

01:13:12.168 --> 01:13:16.036
On the contrary, there is not a family
on God's green Earth...

01:13:16.105 --> 01:13:18.733
...that takes better care of you
than the US Army.

01:13:18.808 --> 01:13:20.070
Really?

01:13:21.010 --> 01:13:22.238
Really.

01:13:24.013 --> 01:13:26.675
Civilian life's for people
who ain't seen shit.

01:13:26.749 --> 01:13:28.580
It's too late for you.

01:13:28.651 --> 01:13:32.246
You've already seen the shit.
You can't unsee it anymore.

01:13:32.321 --> 01:13:37.486
You can't be an insurance salesman now,
brother. It's too fucking late.

01:13:38.661 --> 01:13:40.595
How's that beautiful garden?

01:13:40.663 --> 01:13:43.427
Oh, it's doing well.
It's his pride and joy.

01:13:43.499 --> 01:13:45.694
Oh, yes. He must have you working on it.

01:13:45.768 --> 01:13:47.759
The size of those strawberries.

01:13:47.837 --> 01:13:50.601
I'll see you, Ralph.
Good-bye, Mrs. Flanigan.

01:13:50.673 --> 01:13:52.163
Good-bye, now.

01:13:54.477 --> 01:13:55.876
Ralph Flanigan?

01:13:57.213 --> 01:13:58.703
Do I know you?

01:13:58.781 --> 01:14:01.978
You're Walton Flanigan's father?

01:14:02.051 --> 01:14:03.279
Yes?

01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:16.191
Oh, God!

01:14:17.533 --> 01:14:19.933
Oh, my God, what's wrong? Ralph?

01:14:20.002 --> 01:14:21.196
Ralph?

01:14:22.271 --> 01:14:24.603
- Ralph?
- Oh, God.

01:14:26.408 --> 01:14:28.774
- Ma'am...
- No.

01:14:28.844 --> 01:14:30.835
- No.
- Talk to me, sweetheart.

01:14:32.982 --> 01:14:37.112
The Secretary of the Army
has asked me to express...

01:14:37.186 --> 01:14:41.350
...his deep regret that your son,
Walton Flanigan...

01:14:41.423 --> 01:14:44.051
...died yesterday in Iraq.

01:14:44.126 --> 01:14:47.721
He... No.

01:14:47.797 --> 01:14:52.825
The Secretary of the Army
extends his deepest sympathy...

01:14:52.902 --> 01:14:56.998
...to you and your family
in your tragic loss.

01:15:06.415 --> 01:15:07.609
No.

01:15:11.487 --> 01:15:16.254
A Casualty Assistance Officer
will contact you within a few hours.

01:15:16.325 --> 01:15:20.659
Do you need anything? Do you need a ride?
Do you want us to call someone?

01:15:20.729 --> 01:15:24.688
- No.
- I'm so sorry, ma'am.

01:15:26.302 --> 01:15:28.361
I'm so sorry, sir.

01:15:32.808 --> 01:15:34.298
Where'd they go?

01:15:35.144 --> 01:15:36.634
They took off.

01:15:45.221 --> 01:15:47.746
- What?
- What'd I tell you from day one?

01:15:47.823 --> 01:15:51.623
You do not touch the NOK.
You gotta wake the fuck up.

01:15:51.694 --> 01:15:53.184
You're not in high school.

01:15:53.262 --> 01:15:56.197
You're not in a fucking rock band.
You're in the army.

01:15:56.265 --> 01:15:59.530
Yeah, I know. I know I'm in the army.
I gave blood to the army.

01:16:00.269 --> 01:16:04.137
I got blown up in a firefight
that lasted longer than your entire war.

01:16:04.206 --> 01:16:08.336
I didn't sunbathe in Kuwait
with the rest of the POG's. I fought!

01:16:17.386 --> 01:16:21.254
That was not your job
and you did not follow procedure.

01:16:22.791 --> 01:16:26.750
Fuck procedure, Tony.
They're human beings.

01:16:28.631 --> 01:16:30.155
They're just people.

01:16:31.433 --> 01:16:33.128
They're not like you.

01:17:33.996 --> 01:17:35.054
Get in.

01:17:39.535 --> 01:17:42.902
It's gonna take you a week
at this rate. Get in.

01:17:49.111 --> 01:17:51.875
Hey, guess what? I already let it go.

01:17:58.053 --> 01:18:01.022
Hey, stubborn, get in the fucking car!

01:18:13.569 --> 01:18:14.797
Thanks.

01:18:24.513 --> 01:18:28.040
Dorsett thinks you need some time away.
Clear your head.

01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:30.176
He told me to look after you.

01:18:30.219 --> 01:18:31.243
<i>Yeah...</i>

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:32.810
I don't need anything.

01:18:32.888 --> 01:18:34.879
<i>You walked home. You need it.</i>

01:18:34.957 --> 01:18:37.858
<i>We're off till Tuesday.</i>
<i>I got everything planned out.</i>

01:18:37.926 --> 01:18:42.522
Just bring your bathing suit and your ACU's
and the girls are totally into it.

01:18:42.598 --> 01:18:45.032
<i>What girls? Into what?</i>

01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:47.967
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>They won't go if it's just me.</i>

01:18:49.738 --> 01:18:52.400
<i>Milk in the bottle</i>
<i>Milk in the bottle</i>

01:18:52.474 --> 01:18:55.500
<i>Well, that sounds like...</i>
<i>That sounds really good.</i>

01:18:55.577 --> 01:18:57.101
<i>What are you wearing?</i>

01:18:58.647 --> 01:19:02.515
<i>Hey, come on. You're my buddy, right?</i>

01:19:02.584 --> 01:19:04.814
<i>I haven't had any in decades.</i>

01:19:04.887 --> 01:19:07.321
Okay, so don't make me beg, just...

01:19:07.389 --> 01:19:10.620
I need to get laid and you do too, right?

01:19:10.692 --> 01:19:12.819
Can we take my car?

01:19:14.163 --> 01:19:17.599
I'll let you choose the girl.
How's that?

01:19:22.271 --> 01:19:25.570
You sure your step dad
ain't gonna show up?

01:19:25.641 --> 01:19:28.872
No, he's fishing in Alaska
till the end of the season.

01:19:30.245 --> 01:19:31.542
Fishing.

01:19:31.613 --> 01:19:33.205
In Alaska.

01:19:50.632 --> 01:19:51.621
Nice.

01:19:55.637 --> 01:19:57.628
That's not distracting.

01:19:57.706 --> 01:19:59.697
How embarrassing.

01:20:06.515 --> 01:20:07.504
God.

01:20:09.184 --> 01:20:10.276
Yes!

01:20:10.352 --> 01:20:12.183
- Want a piece of gum?
- Yeah.

01:20:24.533 --> 01:20:27.900
Choke me. Choke me. Come on. Come on.

01:20:30.038 --> 01:20:32.131
I know. I'm sorry.

01:20:32.207 --> 01:20:34.698
- Come on.
- She doesn't ever close the door.

01:20:34.776 --> 01:20:35.800
Yeah.

01:20:42.718 --> 01:20:43.912
Keep going.

01:20:44.987 --> 01:20:46.750
Come on.

01:21:01.837 --> 01:21:03.327
Gross.

01:21:06.775 --> 01:21:08.242
Hey.

01:21:09.511 --> 01:21:11.741
Is there any more beer left in the car?

01:21:16.285 --> 01:21:18.082
What the hell you doing?

01:21:18.153 --> 01:21:22.988
It's okay. It's all right.
I'm just... Taking the edge off.

01:21:23.926 --> 01:21:26.588
Extraordinary times, right?

01:21:30.566 --> 01:21:33.899
Hey, you can give me a break, can't you?
You're my buddy, aren't you?

01:21:35.704 --> 01:21:39.401
Hey. Come on.
We've been to hell and back together.

01:21:41.210 --> 01:21:43.201
Three years just like that.

01:21:43.278 --> 01:21:46.805
You know what? He knows what he's doing.
It's good. Let's just go to sleep.

01:21:46.882 --> 01:21:48.372
Yeah, lets go to bed.

01:21:48.450 --> 01:21:52.045
- Go to bed.
- Fucking asshole.

01:22:01.563 --> 01:22:04.123
I'm more fun when I drink.

01:22:06.201 --> 01:22:07.463
Sergeant.

01:22:07.536 --> 01:22:10.835
You missed out. That's the whole problem.

01:22:10.906 --> 01:22:15.240
That is the whole problem
this time around in Iraq.

01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:20.373
Vietnam, those guys
got laid six ways from Sunday.

01:22:21.650 --> 01:22:24.881
Bosnia... Best brothels in the world.

01:22:24.953 --> 01:22:30.687
Desert Storm... we had R and R ships
with Filipino hookers...

01:22:30.759 --> 01:22:32.886
...on call.

01:22:36.265 --> 01:22:38.563
Yeah, but this war? I don't know.

01:22:39.334 --> 01:22:44.863
All the religious bullshit, the Crusades
and <i>jihad</i> and nobody getting laid.

01:22:45.974 --> 01:22:51.276
I mean, that right there is half the reason
why everybody's so angry, yeah?

01:22:52.614 --> 01:22:54.809
Hey, Charlie, don't surf!

01:22:58.287 --> 01:23:00.016
- Let's get back.
- Yeah.

01:23:02.124 --> 01:23:04.422
I'm thinking maybe
I ought to have a kid.

01:23:04.493 --> 01:23:07.087
I shouldn't have let you drink.

01:23:07.162 --> 01:23:10.131
No, see, that is your other problem
right there, hero.

01:23:11.633 --> 01:23:14.363
Everything's your fault.
Everything is your responsibility.

01:23:14.436 --> 01:23:18.600
Somebody's gonna fall to pieces?
Well, here's Will with a glue stick.

01:23:19.374 --> 01:23:22.138
Some soldier gets drunk...
Hey, let me tell you something.

01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:26.306
I had a beer last month, okay?

01:23:26.381 --> 01:23:29.248
A few weeks ago, I had a few more.

01:23:29.318 --> 01:23:31.252
- The other day...
- You serious?

01:23:32.587 --> 01:23:34.817
Today is not the day
that I got off the wagon.

01:23:34.890 --> 01:23:39.054
This is the day that I'm gonna not
bother pretending anymore.

01:23:46.902 --> 01:23:50.360
Stay the fuck away from us, you assholes!

01:23:50.439 --> 01:23:53.431
Motherfuckers! Goddamn it!

01:23:53.508 --> 01:23:54.532
It's okay.

01:23:54.609 --> 01:23:56.236
Fuck you!

01:23:56.311 --> 01:23:57.869
Let's head back.

01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:00.771
Stone, let's head back.

01:24:02.851 --> 01:24:04.614
Where'd you learn about knots?

01:24:04.686 --> 01:24:06.517
Oh, Boy Scouts.

01:24:06.588 --> 01:24:11.423
They sure love a good knot. Easy to tie,
easy to untie, hard to pull loose.

01:24:11.493 --> 01:24:13.427
Dude, what's your fucking problem, anyway?

01:24:13.495 --> 01:24:15.190
You own this lake?

01:24:21.636 --> 01:24:23.900
- Lock and load, Sergeant.
- Yes, Sir.

01:24:23.972 --> 01:24:25.735
Hey, ladies.

01:24:25.807 --> 01:24:28.708
- What sorority you girls belong to?
- What the fuck?

01:24:33.715 --> 01:24:38.379
Boy, those girls sure overreacted.
Just a little fight is all.

01:24:42.357 --> 01:24:44.086
I thought they was cool.

01:24:45.494 --> 01:24:46.893
Sorry, buddy.

01:24:49.698 --> 01:24:54.328
Hey, how far did you get
with that girl, Laura?

01:24:54.403 --> 01:24:56.564
- Lara.
- Lara.

01:24:56.638 --> 01:24:59.436
What a name, Lara.

01:25:09.117 --> 01:25:14.521
<i>Give me a home</i>
<i>where the buffalo roam</i>

01:25:14.589 --> 01:25:18.753
<i>Where the deer</i>
<i>and the antelope play</i>

01:25:21.897 --> 01:25:27.858
<i>Where seldom is heard</i>
<i>a discouraging word</i>

01:25:29.104 --> 01:25:33.871
<i>And the skies</i>
<i>are not cloudy all day</i>

01:25:34.576 --> 01:25:39.206
<i>Home, home on the range</i>

01:25:39.281 --> 01:25:44.048
<i>Where the deer</i>
<i>and the antelope play</i>

01:25:45.921 --> 01:25:51.689
<i>Where seldom is heard</i>
<i>a discouraging word</i>

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:57.062
<i>And the skies</i>
<i>are not cloudy all day</i>

01:25:57.132 --> 01:25:58.827
Whoo!

01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:03.496
<i>Home, home on the range</i>

01:26:09.611 --> 01:26:12.978
Bill! Hi. Good to see you.
Thanks for coming.

01:26:30.499 --> 01:26:33.798
You should have RSVP'd, okay?
Alan is gonna freak.

01:26:35.871 --> 01:26:37.805
Hey. I didn't know you...

01:26:37.873 --> 01:26:39.773
Alan, good to see you. Long time.

01:26:40.442 --> 01:26:43.036
Yeah. Jesus, you look terrible.

01:26:43.111 --> 01:26:45.443
I feel terrible.

01:26:47.849 --> 01:26:52.582
Tony, this is Alan.
Alan, Tony, groom-to-be.

01:26:52.654 --> 01:26:55.748
Hey, Tony.
What happened to you guys?

01:26:55.824 --> 01:26:59.885
Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.
We do all our own stunts, you know.

01:26:59.961 --> 01:27:04.091
Kelly, Tony. Tony, Kelly. Bride.

01:27:04.165 --> 01:27:06.360
<i>Enchanté.</i> Hubba-hubba.

01:27:10.372 --> 01:27:14.172
Well... Let's get these guys
some drinks.

01:27:15.911 --> 01:27:17.902
- I was just about to sober up. Come on.
- Sounds good.

01:27:17.979 --> 01:27:22.075
Let's go, Alan.
Come on. All right?

01:27:26.655 --> 01:27:28.145
- You look beautiful.
- Don't.

01:27:29.591 --> 01:27:30.853
You do.

01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:34.621
- What is this?
- It's nothing.

01:27:42.103 --> 01:27:45.163
So, on behalf of everyone in the room...

01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.606
...and those who couldn't
make it here tonight...

01:27:50.011 --> 01:27:53.947
Kelly and Alan...

01:27:56.284 --> 01:27:58.218
...here's to a lifetime together, huh?

01:27:58.286 --> 01:28:00.220
Hear! Hear!

01:28:00.288 --> 01:28:01.983
Whoo! Kelly and Alan.

01:28:03.792 --> 01:28:07.694
Hey, there's a lot better things
we could be doing right now than talking.

01:28:07.762 --> 01:28:09.821
I would like to say something.

01:28:13.034 --> 01:28:16.936
Jesus Christ. Before you do...

01:28:17.005 --> 01:28:21.704
I would like everyone to toast our troops.

01:28:21.776 --> 01:28:23.903
Hear! Hear!

01:28:23.979 --> 01:28:28.643
Love the war or hate it,
we support you guys all the way.

01:28:28.717 --> 01:28:31.277
Hear! Hear!

01:28:34.022 --> 01:28:37.014
- They support us.
- All the way.

01:28:38.526 --> 01:28:39.823
Alan...

01:28:41.529 --> 01:28:43.156
Kelly...

01:28:44.232 --> 01:28:45.961
...family and friends...

01:28:54.009 --> 01:28:56.978
...the Secretary of the Army...

01:28:57.045 --> 01:29:01.880
...is pleased to congratulate you
on your engagement.

01:29:04.452 --> 01:29:06.818
<i>We love it here</i>
<i>We love it here</i>

01:29:06.888 --> 01:29:10.255
<i>You bet your ass</i>
<i>We love it here</i>

01:29:10.325 --> 01:29:12.691
- Hoo-ahh!
- Hoo-ahh!

01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:19.997
Back away.

01:29:33.448 --> 01:29:35.177
Go, Sergeant!

01:29:37.452 --> 01:29:39.079
Fuck me.

01:29:43.892 --> 01:29:46.224
You just caught a. 556 in your upper lip!

01:29:46.294 --> 01:29:47.420
Bang!

01:29:47.495 --> 01:29:48.484
Boom.

01:29:56.805 --> 01:30:00.468
This is America!

01:31:15.016 --> 01:31:16.142
Hey.

01:31:19.654 --> 01:31:20.780
Hey.

01:31:27.662 --> 01:31:29.220
It's time to wake up.

01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:37.495
Jesus, am I dead?

01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:40.364
No.

01:31:43.444 --> 01:31:46.038
Oh, dear God, help me.

01:31:55.190 --> 01:31:57.522
I gotta call my sponsor.

01:32:10.104 --> 01:32:12.538
We should both
get out of this together.

01:32:13.942 --> 01:32:15.432
You could retire.

01:32:17.545 --> 01:32:20.013
We'd go fishing in Alaska.

01:32:28.389 --> 01:32:30.755
Nah, this Dorsett will never let me go.

01:32:30.825 --> 01:32:32.417
He doesn't own you.

01:32:33.995 --> 01:32:35.758
He saved my life.

01:32:36.497 --> 01:32:40.627
Got me sober... Until yesterday.

01:32:43.771 --> 01:32:46.365
The army owns me and that's fine with me.

01:32:50.345 --> 01:32:53.610
That's not fine with me.
Come on.

01:33:09.764 --> 01:33:11.925
All I ever wanted...

01:33:13.401 --> 01:33:15.062
was to get shot at.

01:33:19.007 --> 01:33:23.637
That too much to ask for
on the battlefield? A battle?

01:33:27.415 --> 01:33:29.940
I thought you said you had your baptism.

01:33:33.588 --> 01:33:35.180
Yeah, well, I lied.

01:33:37.859 --> 01:33:39.520
Wasn't much of a war.

01:34:01.215 --> 01:34:02.375
Heads up.

01:34:12.293 --> 01:34:14.591
Dale Martin's my name.
Do you remember me?

01:34:16.297 --> 01:34:17.286
Yes, sir.

01:34:32.914 --> 01:34:35.678
You know what's the last thing
my son said to me?

01:34:37.885 --> 01:34:43.323
He said,
"I'll see you next week. " On the phone.

01:34:43.391 --> 01:34:45.382
That's what he said, from over there.

01:34:48.930 --> 01:34:52.229
And all I said was, "Yeah. "

01:34:56.938 --> 01:34:57.927
I'm...

01:35:00.008 --> 01:35:01.771
I'm not a good talker.

01:35:05.079 --> 01:35:06.307
But...

01:35:10.151 --> 01:35:12.745
Will you please forgive me?

01:35:16.891 --> 01:35:20.486
Sir, there's nothing to forgive.

01:35:43.251 --> 01:35:45.719
Mama said there'd be days like these.

01:35:58.332 --> 01:36:04.100
<i>Our LTwas taking fire</i>
<i>two blocks down...</i>

01:36:04.172 --> 01:36:08.871
<i>and so I made a decision</i>
<i>to move up this alleyway...</i>

01:36:08.943 --> 01:36:12.401
<i>so we could get into this</i> haji <i>market</i>
<i>that I knew had roof access.</i>

01:36:15.316 --> 01:36:18.149
Sniper fire came down on us
from everywhere.

01:36:18.219 --> 01:36:20.517
It was just pop, pop, pop, pop.

01:36:20.588 --> 01:36:26.151
And we're all scrambling
around trying to get some cover...

01:36:26.227 --> 01:36:28.252
when an I ED goes off.

01:36:28.329 --> 01:36:29.990
You know, blows us back.

01:36:31.999 --> 01:36:33.489
And we're all...

01:36:38.139 --> 01:36:42.269
But I can see Timmerman
is still standing, and he has...

01:36:43.144 --> 01:36:47.376
...he has this flap hanging off
the side of his head...

01:36:47.448 --> 01:36:50.110
...and when he turns around,
I can see it's the...

01:36:50.184 --> 01:36:52.379
I can see it's the side of his face.

01:36:52.453 --> 01:36:56.947
Two of my guys behind us are hit
and I'm yelling at them...

01:36:57.024 --> 01:37:00.289
...you know, yelling,
"Get out of the road"...

01:37:00.361 --> 01:37:03.194
...but they're screaming so loud
they can't hear me.

01:37:03.264 --> 01:37:07.963
So I take off. I pick one of'em up.

01:37:09.837 --> 01:37:11.134
He was...

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:16.567
I don't know,
third month, fourth month, 18, 19.

01:37:16.644 --> 01:37:18.635
Pull the other one with my free hand...

01:37:18.713 --> 01:37:21.341
...take us and drop them behind
these truck tires.

01:37:21.415 --> 01:37:26.216
And we're all catching our breath,
trying to radio the bird...

01:37:28.256 --> 01:37:29.780
when I see Derek...

01:37:31.726 --> 01:37:33.717
...just bleeding out in the middle
of the street.

01:37:33.794 --> 01:37:35.785
Now, sniper fire had slowed...

01:37:37.665 --> 01:37:39.656
...and he was on his back.

01:37:41.969 --> 01:37:44.233
He had his hands up like this.

01:37:44.305 --> 01:37:48.139
Looked like he was... Like he was praying.

01:37:48.209 --> 01:37:53.169
Nothing but noise from the radio,
so I make a mad dash to him.

01:37:53.848 --> 01:37:56.146
It's pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop!

01:37:56.217 --> 01:38:00.017
Grab his wrist, drag him across the street
behind this burned-out old car.

01:38:01.722 --> 01:38:04.418
And he looking down at his hands.

01:38:04.492 --> 01:38:06.221
He keeps looking down at his damn hands.

01:38:06.294 --> 01:38:09.422
He keeps opening them and closing them...

01:38:09.497 --> 01:38:12.898
...and he's opening,
he keeps saying over and over...

01:38:12.967 --> 01:38:16.368
"I can't feel my hands.
I can't feel my hands. "

01:38:16.437 --> 01:38:19.235
And I'm looking down at his hands.
His hands are fine.

01:38:19.307 --> 01:38:21.468
There's not a spot on them...

01:38:21.542 --> 01:38:24.409
when his left leg is, you know,
halfway down the block.

01:38:24.478 --> 01:38:29.040
So I start pushing him
underneath the car...

01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:33.345
...and I'm saying, " Derek, your hands
are fine. Your hands are fine.

01:38:34.689 --> 01:38:36.179
Just sit tight. "

01:38:36.257 --> 01:38:40.819
And he looked at me like I was...

01:38:40.895 --> 01:38:43.227
He looked at me like I was lying to him.

01:38:45.433 --> 01:38:47.901
And that's when the I ED
went off under him.

01:38:51.405 --> 01:38:52.565
Jesus.

01:38:55.309 --> 01:38:59.769
I actually got pieces of him
blasted right into me.

01:38:59.847 --> 01:39:01.337
It was like...

01:39:03.484 --> 01:39:04.951
...flesh shrapnel.

01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:08.381
When I came to,
I had already been to the FOB.

01:39:08.456 --> 01:39:12.222
I was on my way to Ramstein. In the hospital,
I'm laid out and some guy comes in.

01:39:12.293 --> 01:39:17.060
I can't see very well,
and he drops this little...

01:39:17.131 --> 01:39:19.793
...drops a little ribbon
on my bare chest and I'm...

01:39:19.867 --> 01:39:25.806
I'm all hooked up to wires and machines
and heart rate monitors...

01:39:27.475 --> 01:39:29.409
IV's and shit.

01:39:29.477 --> 01:39:31.911
Shit I, you know, shit I don't need.

01:39:31.979 --> 01:39:33.879
And he...

01:39:35.616 --> 01:39:38.107
...he says, " Son...

01:39:41.122 --> 01:39:42.646
...you're a hero. "

01:39:43.791 --> 01:39:45.986
Damn right, you are.

01:39:47.595 --> 01:39:48.653
No.

01:39:51.866 --> 01:39:54.357
No, I... No.

01:39:56.370 --> 01:39:57.860
I put him there.

01:39:58.939 --> 01:40:00.429
I did that.

01:40:02.043 --> 01:40:04.841
That was me.
I didn't mean to. I didn't plan that.

01:40:04.912 --> 01:40:06.937
There's no planning. You can't plan.

01:40:08.683 --> 01:40:10.878
You only have the moment,
but that's what I did.

01:40:10.951 --> 01:40:12.111
L...

01:40:13.988 --> 01:40:16.354
I loaded him into the bomb.

01:40:26.967 --> 01:40:29.026
That's not a hero in my book.

01:40:32.873 --> 01:40:36.775
A couple weeks later,
I'm on crutches.

01:40:40.147 --> 01:40:43.480
Major surgery. Fox eye shield patch.

01:40:44.452 --> 01:40:50.220
And everything looks gray...
the nurses, the flowers, blood.

01:40:51.092 --> 01:40:53.686
I'm wandering the halls in the hospital.

01:40:57.665 --> 01:40:59.223
My ears are ringing.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.367
I take the elevator up to the roof
and climb the stairs.

01:41:03.437 --> 01:41:05.997
And we're not supposed to be up there...

01:41:06.073 --> 01:41:10.908
...but that's where the doctors
take their smoke breaks.

01:41:12.413 --> 01:41:13.903
So the door was open.

01:41:15.282 --> 01:41:16.772
And the whole...

01:41:18.619 --> 01:41:23.818
...the whole living thing just didn't,
you know, make sense anymore.

01:41:23.891 --> 01:41:25.222
It was...

01:41:28.162 --> 01:41:30.187
I was out there for a while...

01:41:33.634 --> 01:41:35.124
...standing on the edge...

01:41:37.204 --> 01:41:41.231
...and it was cold and it was dark...

01:41:43.978 --> 01:41:45.605
...and I felt calm.

01:41:48.015 --> 01:41:49.573
Why didn't you jump?

01:42:03.197 --> 01:42:04.789
The sun came up.

01:42:07.301 --> 01:42:08.825
The sun came up?

01:42:09.837 --> 01:42:11.031
Yes.

01:42:13.174 --> 01:42:15.074
The sun came up and...

01:42:16.277 --> 01:42:18.837
...and I didn't feel like dying anymore.

01:42:24.752 --> 01:42:26.242
Want another one?

01:42:28.756 --> 01:42:30.246
No, I just...

01:42:31.959 --> 01:42:33.392
Pepsi.

01:42:33.461 --> 01:42:36.555
This fake beer tastes like laundry.

01:44:09.390 --> 01:44:11.449
Pass me the ball. Pass me the ball.

01:44:15.596 --> 01:44:17.086
Where you heading?

01:44:17.765 --> 01:44:19.665
Louisiana.

01:44:23.170 --> 01:44:24.660
Taking the piano.

01:44:26.574 --> 01:44:28.064
What?

01:44:28.142 --> 01:44:29.632
Why?

01:44:29.710 --> 01:44:32.178
- Do you play?
- No.

01:44:34.448 --> 01:44:35.938
A little bit.

01:44:37.284 --> 01:44:41.118
My mom forced me when I was a kid.

01:44:41.789 --> 01:44:43.313
I hated it.

01:44:45.225 --> 01:44:47.090
Hey, you don't have to...

01:44:51.165 --> 01:44:52.655
Thanks a lot.

01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:15.215
- Yes!
- Good-bye, Will.

01:45:18.626 --> 01:45:20.025
Good luck.

01:45:25.432 --> 01:45:29.334
Look, I've never been very good at timing.

01:45:31.538 --> 01:45:33.529
I wouldn't say that.

01:45:34.875 --> 01:45:40.575
Maybe... You'd let me know where you are,
you know, your address?

01:45:41.915 --> 01:45:43.815
I don't mind driving.

01:45:51.258 --> 01:45:53.249
I think I could handle that.

01:45:54.995 --> 01:45:56.189
Okay?

01:45:57.131 --> 01:45:58.689
Okay.

01:46:02.636 --> 01:46:03.864
E- Mail?

01:46:05.205 --> 01:46:08.231
Yeah. I just have to get a computer first.

01:46:08.942 --> 01:46:10.910
I could check at Tony's, though.

01:46:12.246 --> 01:46:13.736
You're staying on?

01:46:13.814 --> 01:46:15.714
Thinking about it.

01:46:24.124 --> 01:46:29.687
Why don't you come inside
and give me your address...

01:46:29.763 --> 01:46:31.856
...and I'll write you a letter.

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.124
I'd like that.

01:46:48.749 --> 01:46:50.410
Yeah.
