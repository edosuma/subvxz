WEBVTT

00:01.032 --> 00:04.004
MORNING. MM.

00:04.004 --> 00:07.007
OH. WOW. OKAY. HEY THERE.
LET'S, UH... AND BREAK!

00:07.007 --> 00:09.110
CAN I GIVE YOU
SOME CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM?

00:09.110 --> 00:11.612
AS LONG AS YOU START
WITH SOMETHING NICE.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.515
YOU ARE A GREAT GAL,
REALLY SMART AND FUNNY--

00:14.515 --> 00:17.017
(gasps)
I CAN SWIM REAL FAST.

00:17.017 --> 00:20.391
SO FAST. BUT YOUR HUGS ARE
TOO INTENSE. NOW I LOVE 'EM--

00:20.391 --> 00:23.394
NOT REALLY--BUT WITH PEOPLE
WHO YOU AREN'T SLEEPING WITH,

00:23.394 --> 00:27.258
YOU CAN'T GIVE THEM A "STAB ME
WITH YOUR PELVIC BONE" HUG.
(chuckles)
BUT PEOPLE LOVE THEM.

00:27.258 --> 00:30.261
BUT PEOPLE DON'T. LOOK, JUST
DIAL IT BACK A LITTLE, OKAY?

00:30.261 --> 00:33.804
LIKE, SAY I'M A GROCERY BOY
WHO JUST HELPED YOU

00:33.804 --> 00:36.407
WITH YOUR GROCERIES.
HOW DO YOU THANK ME?

00:36.407 --> 00:39.540
OHH! SEE? THAT'S--
THAT'S--THAT'S A LITTLE MUCH.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.742
OKAY. MM.
(door opens)

00:41.742 --> 00:44.415
AW!

00:44.415 --> 00:47.678
HAPPY THANKSGIVING BREAK,
SWEETIE. MWAH.
MWAH.

00:47.678 --> 00:50.521
OH, I'M SO GLAD
YOU COULD MAKE IT, KEVIN.
(chuckles)

00:50.521 --> 00:53.254
OHH!
JULES.

00:53.254 --> 00:56.787
I CAN'T HELP IT.
IT'S LIKE HUGGING A SOFA. MM!

00:56.787 --> 00:59.390
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME,
MRS. COBB, SIR.

00:59.390 --> 01:01.332
LET'S GO.

01:01.332 --> 01:04.235
DID YOU NOTICE THAT KEVIN
JUST THANKED BOTH OF US?

01:04.235 --> 01:07.368
THIS IS OUR FIRST THANKSGIVING
THAT WE'RE HOSTING TOGETHER.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.300
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE READY?

01:09.300 --> 01:12.303
I WAS HERE LAST YEAR. HOW DOES
HOSTING MAKE THIS ANY DIFFERENT?

01:12.303 --> 01:15.576
WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE SEX
AFTERWARDS.
I THINK I'M READY.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.449
REALLY?
YEAH.

01:18.449 --> 01:20.451
OHH! MM!

01:20.451 --> 01:22.082
UGH. ANDY,
YOUR BROTHER CALLEDME

01:22.082 --> 01:24.485
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT PICKING UP
YOUR CELL.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.087
BIG MARIA AND LITTLE MARIA
AND WHEELCHAIR MARIA

01:27.087 --> 01:28.489
ALL SAY "HI."

01:28.489 --> 01:31.091
OH.
DEAR GOD,
I HATE YOUR FAMILY.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.493
SORRY, BABE.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.565
(sighs) I LOST MY CELL.

01:34.565 --> 01:37.168
(gasps) MY LIFE WOULD
FALL APART WITHOUT MY PHONE.

01:37.168 --> 01:39.170
IT'S LIKE MY SECOND BRAIN.

01:39.170 --> 01:40.831
ONLY BRAIN.

01:40.831 --> 01:44.175
UGH. IT HAS MY CALENDAR,
MY E-MAIL, ALL MY APPS,

01:44.175 --> 01:46.837
LIKE
MY BIRTH CONTROL REMINDER...
MM.

01:46.837 --> 01:48.709
MY UPDO HOW-TO...
OH.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.711
AND MY DEATH ROW TRACKER.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.843
SO IT VIBRATES EVERY TIME
SOMEONE GETS EXECUTED. YEAH.

01:52.843 --> 01:55.846
MY CANDY JOURNAL,
MY DRAMATIC MUSIC STING,

01:55.846 --> 01:57.448
MY VIRTUAL HOROSCOPE...

01:57.448 --> 01:59.350
(both imitate gunshot)

01:59.350 --> 02:03.294
REALLY? 'CAUSE I JUST DOWNLOADED
AN APP APP. WHEN YOU SHAKE IT,

02:03.294 --> 02:06.197
ZACH BRAFF TELLS YOU WHAT
APPETIZER TO ORDER.

02:06.197 --> 02:09.230
(boing)
HOW ABOUT SOME POTATO SKINS?

02:09.230 --> 02:11.532
YUM.
GOOD-BYE.

02:11.532 --> 02:14.405
HONEY, DID YOU CANCEL
YOUR CELL YET?

02:14.405 --> 02:17.708
NAH. SOMEONE WILL BRING IT BACK.
EVERYTHING GOES MY WAY.

02:17.708 --> 02:21.472
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT WILL.
IS HE BEING SERIOUS
RIGHT NOW?

02:21.472 --> 02:24.315
'CAUSE IF HE IS,
I WANNA PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE.

02:24.315 --> 02:27.648
IT WON'T STOP HIM. HE'S
THE WORLD'S BIGGEST OPTIMIST.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.320
UGH.

02:29.320 --> 02:31.782
(boing)
I LOVE POT STICKERS.

02:31.782 --> 02:34.655
WAITER!

02:34.655 --> 02:37.388
THANK YOU.
HI.

02:37.388 --> 02:40.391
(door closes)
HEY, SISTER. WHIP ME UP
A 'ARAMELMACCHATATA,

02:40.391 --> 02:44.164
TWO 'SPRESSO PUMPS,
AND A CRAPLOAD OF EXTRA FOAM.
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

02:44.164 --> 02:46.467
'ARAMEL MACCH, TWO 'SPRESSO
PUMPS, CRAPLOAD-A FOAM.

02:46.467 --> 02:50.401
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU.
CRAPLOAD-A FOAM, GIRL!
CRAPLOAD-A FOAM!

02:50.401 --> 02:52.903
IT WAS RIDICULOUS.

02:52.903 --> 02:55.806
YOU GUYS CAN UNDERSTAND
WHAT I SAY, RIGHT?

02:55.806 --> 02:57.678
IT SHOULD BE ME.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.381
LISTEN, I PROBABLY SHOULD'VE
BROUGHT THIS UP TO YOU

03:00.381 --> 03:03.384
IN OUR FIFTH OR SIXTH YEAR
OF MARRIAGE, BUT, YOU SEE,

03:03.384 --> 03:06.857
SOMETIMES, UM,
WHEN YOU TALK TOO QUICKLY

03:06.857 --> 03:08.819
OR, UM, TOO QUIETLY...

03:08.819 --> 03:11.622
MM-HMM. YEAH.
OR, WELL,
JUST WHEN YOU TALK AT ALL--

03:11.622 --> 03:13.224
GET TO IT!

03:13.224 --> 03:15.866
BOBBY, WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND
ONE WORD YOU SAY.

03:15.866 --> 03:18.229
OR AS YOU WOULD PUT IT,

03:18.229 --> 03:21.602
"WE CAIN'TGROUBERDAN
YUR FRAZZLE DAZZLE!"

03:21.602 --> 03:23.834
(laughs)

03:23.834 --> 03:26.607
Y'ALL THINK YOU'RE FUNNIER
THAN A BARREL

03:26.607 --> 03:29.910
FULL OF FOXWORTHYS,
BUT YOU'RE NOT.
BOBBY, YOU'RE RIGHT! WE'RE
SORRY. WHAT DID HE JUST SAY?

03:29.910 --> 03:32.383
(door opens and closes)
(laughs) GOT ME!

03:32.383 --> 03:33.914
FRAZZLE DAZZLE.
(laughs)

03:33.914 --> 03:36.517
OH, NO, NO, NO.
NO CASHEWS. I'M ALLERGIC.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.519
CASHEWS, PENICILLIN,
AND CAT DANDER,

03:38.519 --> 03:40.921
WHATEVER THE HELL THAT IS.

03:40.921 --> 03:43.894
OH, I'M ALLERGIC TO OYSTERS,
ONIONS, AND... MY EX-WIFE.

03:43.894 --> 03:45.656
(imitates rimshot)

03:45.656 --> 03:47.798
(lowered voice) NO, NO, NO,
SERIOUSLY. SHE'S RIGHT THERE.

03:47.798 --> 03:49.800
WOW. ARE THOSE REAL?

03:49.800 --> 03:51.762
YEAH.

03:51.762 --> 03:54.365
GRAYSON, HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

03:54.365 --> 03:56.767
VIVIAN, YOU REMEMBER JULES,
OUR OLD NEIGHBOR?

03:56.767 --> 03:58.739
HEY, VIV. (chuckles)
(chuckles)

03:58.739 --> 04:02.743
MISSED YOU. YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY.
I'M--I'M BAD AT HUGS.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.945
JULES AND I
ARE TOGETHER NOW.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.748
THAT'S WHY SHE'S ACTING
SO WEIRD.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.850
YOU ALWAYS DID LIKE
TO WATCH HER JOG.

04:09.850 --> 04:12.853
THAT IS THE SWEETEST THING
ANYONE'S EVER SAID TO ME.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.255
WELL, IT WAS GOOD
TO SEE YOU BOTH.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.358
YOU, TOO! (chuckles)

04:17.358 --> 04:19.360
UGH. THANK GOD THAT IS OVER.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.563
OH, GOOD.
WE'RE FOLLOWING HER.

04:22.563 --> 04:26.497
(door closes)
OKAY, I HAVE BEEN SO UPSET ABOUT
YOUR LOST PHONE THAT I FORGOT

04:26.497 --> 04:29.039
TO TEND TO MY VIRTUAL HORSE'S
VIRTUAL BROKEN LEG,

04:29.039 --> 04:32.042
AND I HAD TO VIRTUALLY SHOOT
HIM IN THE HEAD.

04:32.042 --> 04:35.005
YOUR LIFE IS SO DUMB.

04:35.005 --> 04:38.349
NOT NOW, GOLDEN GIRL. ANDY,
YOUR PHONE ISN'T COMING BACK.

04:38.349 --> 04:40.881
I MEAN, HAVE YOU EVEN CALLED IT
TO SEE WHO PICKS UP?

04:40.881 --> 04:42.813
LET'S DO THAT.
(cell phone speed-dials)

04:42.813 --> 04:44.415
(beep, cell phone rings)

04:44.415 --> 04:46.757
WAIT. WHAT?
(ring)

04:46.757 --> 04:49.660
OH, IT'S LAURIE.
SHE'S FUN.
(beep)

04:49.660 --> 04:53.664
HEY, LAURIE. IT WAS RETURNED.
(laughs) INTERESTING. BYE!
(beeps)

04:53.664 --> 04:55.726
HAND-DELIVERED
BY A TINY CHINESE MAN

04:55.726 --> 04:58.699
WHO ALSO GAVE ME
A SCALP MASSAGE TO DIE FOR.

04:58.699 --> 05:02.002
WAS HE A MASSEUSE
OR SOMETHING?
NOPE. JUST HAPPENED.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.605
NO!
WHAT IF BEING OPTIMISTIC
ACTUALLY MAKES GOOD THINGS

05:04.605 --> 05:07.037
HAPPEN IN YOUR LIFE, HMM?
IN YOUR HEAD,

05:07.037 --> 05:10.040
IT'S ALL DOOM AND GLOOM.
IN MY HEAD, I HEAR MUSIC.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.913
IT'S ALL BOUNCY, POSITIVE STUFF,
LIKE REGGAE.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.515
(imitates reggae beat)

05:14.515 --> 05:17.518
(Jamaican accent) в™Є THE PHONE
COME BACK, THE LIFE IS GOOD в™Є

05:17.518 --> 05:19.920
в™Є ME SCALP GOT RUBBED
BY A CHINESE DUDE в™Є

05:19.920 --> 05:22.052
в™Є JAMAICA! в™Є

05:22.052 --> 05:23.924
в™Є OH, DAH-OH-DOH-DOH в™Є

05:23.924 --> 05:26.927
I AM GOING TO BEAT
THE OPTIMISM OUT OF THAT MAN,

05:26.927 --> 05:29.059
AND I KNOW HE'S YOUR HUSBAND,
BUT THEN--

05:29.059 --> 05:30.661
LAURIE, ENOUGH. I'M IN.

05:30.661 --> 05:32.403
(gasps) AAH!

05:32.403 --> 05:35.666
GREAT SHOPPING WITH YOU,
VIVVERS!

05:35.666 --> 05:37.808
WHY DID WE HAVE
TO FOLLOW HER?

05:37.808 --> 05:40.411
I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST THAT
I SAW HER LAST THANKSGIVING,

05:40.411 --> 05:42.873
AND SHE WAS WITH HER NEW HUSBAND
AND PREGNANT.

05:42.873 --> 05:45.546
SHE LOOKED AT ME
WITH SUCH PITY.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.947
IT WAS LIKE,

05:46.947 --> 05:50.521
"MY LIFE'S SO GREAT,
AND YOU'VE... GOT NOTHING."

05:51.922 --> 05:55.986
HEY.
BUT NOW I HAVE EVERYTHING.

05:55.986 --> 05:58.589
I JUST NEEDED HER
TO SEE THAT.

05:58.589 --> 06:00.661
(giggles)
WHAT?

06:00.661 --> 06:03.934
NOTHING. IT'S JUST, THIS IS
SO AWESOME. JUST KEEP GOING.

06:03.934 --> 06:07.798
I'M HAPPIER WITH YOU THAN
I HAVE EVER BEEN IN MY LIFE.

06:07.798 --> 06:10.401
OH, GRAYSON.

06:10.401 --> 06:13.544
MM.

06:13.544 --> 06:16.146
I LOVE YOU.

06:16.146 --> 06:19.480
JULES...

06:19.480 --> 06:21.011
THANK YOU.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.886
WE STILL GOTTA GET
SOME YAMS, RIGHT?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.758
YEAH. AISLE TWO.
YAMS?

06:27.758 --> 06:29.760
YEAH.
YEAH. YEAH. AISLE TWO.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.692
(cart rattles)

06:31.692 --> 06:33.664
в™Єв™Єв™Є

06:42.703 --> 06:45.005
SO HE DIDN'T SAY,
"I LOVE YOU" BACK.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.007
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL,
RIGHT?

06:47.007 --> 06:49.840
YOU PROMISED YOU WOULDN'T SAY IT
BEFORE HE DID.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.713
IT JUST SLIPPED OUT.
IT WAS LIKE A SODA BURP.

06:52.713 --> 06:55.015
LOOK, WE'VE BEEN REALLY
INTO EACH OTHER LATELY.

06:55.015 --> 06:58.018
I-I... (lowered voice) LET ME
TELL YA, THE OTHER MORNING,

06:58.018 --> 07:01.091
WE WERE IN THE SHOWER...
(chuckles) GO--
WHAT?

07:01.091 --> 07:05.095
(normal voice) HEY, KEV.
HOW YA DOIN' OVER THERE?
ALL GOOD. JUST CHILLIN' WHILE
TRAV VIDEO CHATS WITH HIS LADY.

07:05.095 --> 07:07.097
(pop music playing)

07:07.097 --> 07:10.100
BABE... (chuckles) WHY DO
YOU ALWAYS MAKE ME DO THIS?

07:10.100 --> 07:13.534
You love it.
Ooh. Slow song.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.435
(midtempo ballad playing)

07:15.435 --> 07:18.438
(man) в™Є And every night,
I see you smile в™Є

07:18.438 --> 07:20.941
в™Є And every night,
I feel your touch в™Є

07:20.941 --> 07:23.844
THEY VIDEO DANCE.
(both) HMM?

07:23.844 --> 07:26.446
I HATE IT!
AND THAT'S KEVIN.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.619
OH. YEAH.
OH, WOW. OKAY.

07:28.619 --> 07:31.181
YOU KNOW WHY I'M NOT GONNA PANIC
ABOUT GRAYSON? BECAUSE HE WANTED

07:31.181 --> 07:33.824
TO SAY IT, HE JUST--WE WERE
IN THE GROCERY STORE.

07:33.824 --> 07:36.156
WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH
HE HATES FLUORESCENT LIGHTS.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.829
(lowered voice)
I DIDN'T KNOW HE--
SHH, SHH!

07:38.829 --> 07:41.792
I'VE JUST GOTTA GIVE HIM
A LITTLE PUSH. THAT'S WHY I HAVE

07:41.792 --> 07:44.034
TO MAKE THIS THE MOST ROMANTIC
THANKSGIVING EVER.

07:44.034 --> 07:46.036
THAT'S MY PLAN.
TELL ME IT'S GREAT.

07:46.036 --> 07:48.839
THANKSGIVING IS NOT
A SEXY HOLIDAY.

07:48.839 --> 07:50.741
ELLIE THINKS IT'S GREAT.
LAURIE?

07:50.741 --> 07:54.705
IN MY FAMILY, WE HAD TO
KILL OUR OWN TURKEYS.

07:54.705 --> 07:58.509
THE WAY THOSE LITTLE TURKEY
ORPHANS WOULD LOOK UP AT YOU...
(sighs)

07:58.509 --> 08:01.251
DON'T TELL ME THAT
TURKEYS CAN'T CRY!

08:01.251 --> 08:03.684
THIS WILL WORK.
(door opens and closes)

08:03.684 --> 08:06.587
ALL RIGHT, FREEZE.
YOU, TOO, TINY DANCER.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.218
(whines) KEVIN.

08:08.218 --> 08:11.722
YOUR OUTFITS
ARE UNACCEPTABLE.

08:11.722 --> 08:15.025
I WANT YOU ALL
TO BE SWANKY. NOW GO.
(scoffs)

08:15.025 --> 08:17.898
AH. MUCH BETTER.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.731
YOU KNOW, KATY PERRY WORE

08:20.731 --> 08:22.603
12 DIFFERENT OUTFITS

08:22.603 --> 08:24.775
AT THE MTV MUSIC AWARDS.

08:24.775 --> 08:27.738
I'M GONNA BEAT THAT
TONIGHT.

08:27.738 --> 08:30.741
I AM PULLING OUT
ALLOF MY A-LIST OUTFITS.

08:30.741 --> 08:33.113
STARTING WITH THE ONE
AFTER THIS?
SERIOUSLY?

08:33.113 --> 08:36.116
ALL RIGHT. NO FIGHTING.
NOT ON ROMANTIC THANKSGIVING.

08:36.116 --> 08:40.120
I'M GONNA GET SOME CANDLES
AND MY TEDDY PENDERGRASS CD.

08:41.992 --> 08:44.254
WHERE SHOULD I PUT THIS WINE?

08:44.254 --> 08:46.256
IN OUR BODIES.
OH!

08:46.256 --> 08:49.259
THAT IS SO SWEET.
THANK YOU.
MM.

08:49.259 --> 08:50.861
THERE YOU GO.

08:50.861 --> 08:54.304
MM. CHEERS. OKAY. LET'S KILL
HIS OPTIMISM. HOW DO WE DO THAT?

08:54.304 --> 08:57.307
HE NEEDS TO LOSE SOMETHING
HE CAN NEVER GET BACK,

08:57.307 --> 08:59.740
SOMETHING REALLY MEANINGFUL.
(cell phone alert chimes)

08:59.740 --> 09:02.272
HOW ABOUT FRIED GRAPES?
THEY WERE ELVIS' FAVORITE.

09:02.272 --> 09:03.874
NOT NOW, ZACH!

09:03.874 --> 09:06.216
SOMETHING MEANINGFUL
LIKE WHAT?

09:06.216 --> 09:08.879
LIKE... (European accent)
HIS WEDDING RING.

09:08.879 --> 09:11.822
OH, MY GOD!
YOU JUST BOOSTED THAT?
(normal voice) MM-HMM.

09:11.822 --> 09:14.855
AW, WHAT'S THE INSCRIPTION
SAY?
OH, NOTHING, UH...

09:14.855 --> 09:16.787
"TOO LEGIT TO QUIT"?

09:16.787 --> 09:18.789
ANDY THOUGHT
IT WAS TIMELESS.

09:18.789 --> 09:20.190
STUPID '90s.

09:20.190 --> 09:25.295
(Teddy Pendergrass's "Tender"
playing)

09:25.295 --> 09:27.738
HEY, EVERYBODY.

09:27.738 --> 09:30.140
WOW, WHAT'S WITH
THE BOOT-KNOCKIN' GROOVES?
(snaps fingers)

09:30.140 --> 09:33.944
IS THAT TEDDY PENDERGRASS?
IT'S HIS THANKSGIVING ALBUM.
IT'S THE SAME SONGS,

09:33.944 --> 09:36.947
BUT INSTEAD OF SAYING "MAKING
LOVE," HE SAYS "EATING TURKEY."

09:36.947 --> 09:38.348
NO, HE DOESN'T. LISTEN.

09:38.348 --> 09:41.011
в™Є I WANNA MAKE SWEET LOVE
TO YOU в™Є

09:41.011 --> 09:43.614
OKAY, DO YOU WANNA
ARGUE ABOUT LYRICS,

09:43.614 --> 09:46.216
OR DO YOU WANNA START
YOUR CO-HOSTING DUTIES

09:46.216 --> 09:49.189
BY HAVING SOME CHAMPAGNE
AND MAYBE MAKING OUT WITH ME?

09:49.189 --> 09:51.762
THE SECOND ONE.
REALLY?

09:51.762 --> 09:54.164
THAT GUY'S MORE WHIPPED

09:54.164 --> 09:56.897
THAN ABAGUHNA-DUHDAH!

09:56.897 --> 09:59.129
(laughter)

09:59.129 --> 10:01.872
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?
THAT WAS INTENTIONAL GIBBERISH.

10:01.872 --> 10:04.975
NOW DO YOU REALLY CARE THAT
LITTLE ABOUT WHAT I HAVE TO SAY?

10:04.975 --> 10:07.137
DAD, NO.

10:07.137 --> 10:09.910
WE UNDERSTAND
BIG... CHUNKS OF YOU.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.142
SOMETIMES WHOLE PARAGRAPHS.

10:12.142 --> 10:16.316
AND WHEN WE DON'T UNDERSTAND,
WE STILL GET YOUR TONE.
NOT HELPING, TRAV.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.055
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

10:25.055 --> 10:28.058
MY WEDDING RING. I DON'T KNOW
HOW IT FELL OFF.

10:28.058 --> 10:30.630
IT USUALLY GETS KNOTTED UP
IN MY KNUCKLE HAIR.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.033
THOSE RINGS ARE A SYMBOL
OF YOUR LOVE. (gasps)

10:33.033 --> 10:36.837
OH, NO. I'M SO SAD, I CAN'T
CATCH MY BREATH. (panting)

10:36.837 --> 10:38.869
(lowered voice)
DIAL IT DOWN!

10:38.869 --> 10:41.241
I'M OKAY. I'M BETTER.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.844
AH, I'LL FIND IT.
EVERYTHING COMES BACK TO ME.

10:43.844 --> 10:46.246
HEY, MAYBE IT SLIPPED OFF
WHEN I TOOK OFF

10:46.246 --> 10:49.649
MY WEIGHT LIFTING GLOVES.
POW! POW! (chuckles)

10:51.852 --> 10:53.824
SUCKAH! (squeals)

10:53.824 --> 10:56.757
(squeals)
IS THAT A BURKA?

10:56.757 --> 10:59.089
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT'S A BURKA?
OH!

10:59.089 --> 11:01.762
I'M GLAD
NO ONE ELSE IS HERE.

11:01.762 --> 11:05.065
I LIKE COOKING WITH YOU
ALONE.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.997
(mouths words)

11:06.997 --> 11:10.670
HEY, WHAT ABOUT TRYING
SOME OF MY STUFFING? OOPS.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.303
MM. MMM.
OH. YOU GOT SOME ON YOUR LIP.
LET ME GET IT.

11:13.303 --> 11:14.875
MM. MMM. (chuckles)
MM. MMM.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.377
DO YOU KNOW WHERE DAD IS?

11:17.377 --> 11:20.150
PROBABLY SOMEWHERE
NOT BEING A THIRD WHEEL.

11:20.150 --> 11:22.312
(crunches)

11:22.312 --> 11:26.186
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID YESTERDAY.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.918
JULES...
YEAH.

11:27.918 --> 11:31.321
YOU ARE SO SPECIAL TO ME...

11:31.321 --> 11:34.194
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW--
I WANNA KNOW.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.997
WELL, I NEED YOU TO KNOW...
TELL ME.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.429
THAT I...
(loud gurgling)

11:39.429 --> 11:43.003
OH, MY GOD.
IS THAT YOUR STOMACH?
WHAT'S IN THAT STUFFING?

11:43.003 --> 11:44.775
WHAT, THE OYSTER STUFFING?

11:44.775 --> 11:48.308
I FORGOT YOU WERE ALLERGIC!
HOW BAD IS IT?
(retches)

11:48.308 --> 11:50.140
OH, GOD!

11:50.140 --> 11:53.884
(sighs) ALL RIGHT.
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING IN HERE?

11:53.884 --> 11:56.947
THE RING IS GONE.
JUST GIVE IT UP

11:56.947 --> 12:00.821
AND ADMIT THAT SOMETIMES
THINGS DON'T GO YOUR WAY.
WELL, IF IT REALLY IS GONE,

12:00.821 --> 12:04.224
I HAVE TO BELIEVE
IT HAPPENED FOR A REASON,

12:04.224 --> 12:06.226
AND MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
WE NEED NEW RINGS,

12:06.226 --> 12:08.829
SINCE THE "TOO LEGIT TO QUIT"
ENGRAVINGS YOU CHOSE

12:08.829 --> 12:10.961
ARE ALITTLEOUTDATED.
YOUCHOSE THEM?

12:10.961 --> 12:13.263
HAMMER'S AN ARTIST,
AND HE'S BEEN OVERLOOKED.
PFFT.

12:13.263 --> 12:15.265
I PROMISE, THOUGH,
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,

12:15.265 --> 12:17.267
GOOD WILL COME TO US.
MAYBE...

12:17.267 --> 12:20.871
(high-pitched voice) I'LL GET
TO MARRY YOU ALL OVER AGAIN.

12:20.871 --> 12:22.272
HEE HEE!
(scoffs)

12:22.272 --> 12:26.016
BARF.
I MARRIED A CARE BEAR.
HE CAN'T BE DEFEATED.

12:26.016 --> 12:28.979
AGREED.
JUST GIVE HIM HIS RING BACK.

12:28.979 --> 12:31.221
I GAVE IT TOYOU.

12:31.221 --> 12:34.955
THAT WAS, LIKE,
FOUR OUTFITS AGO!

12:34.955 --> 12:37.527
HEY, DAD.
YOU KNOW WHAT'LL CHEER YOU UP?

12:37.527 --> 12:40.360
OUR ANNUAL TURKEY DAY GAME
OF CATCH.

12:40.360 --> 12:43.363
(thud)
OKAY, I GET THAT YOU'RE MAD,
BUT I'M NOT SURE

12:43.363 --> 12:46.366
WHO YOU'RE PUNISHING
BY LETTING THE BALL HIT YOU.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.969
(bird cawing in distance)
OH, HE LOCKS HIS MOUTH,

12:48.969 --> 12:51.371
AND YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT
HOW TO SWALLOW THE KEY

12:51.371 --> 12:53.974
WITH A LOCKED MOUTH,
CAN YOU?

12:53.974 --> 12:56.776
FINE. DIDN'T WANNA DO THIS,
BUT COME ON.

12:59.509 --> 13:02.853
SO YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU WON
$300 OFF THAT LOTTO SCRATCHER

13:02.853 --> 13:05.355
AND I VIDEOTAPED IT?
YEAH. SO?

13:05.355 --> 13:08.859
WELL, YOU'RE MAD AT US
BECAUSE WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU,

13:08.859 --> 13:12.222
BUT WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS YOU SAID?

13:12.222 --> 13:15.165
WHOO, BOY! 300 SMACKEROONIES!

13:15.165 --> 13:18.168
WHOO! SWEET LADY VICTORY
SHOWED ME HER BOOBIES, SON!

13:18.168 --> 13:20.570
WE GON' BE EATIN'
BEEF BOURGUIGNONNE TONIGHT!

13:20.570 --> 13:22.172
WHOO!

13:22.172 --> 13:25.205
I'M A MONSTER.

13:25.205 --> 13:28.808
(groans)
AW. YOU FEELING
A LITTLE BETTER?

13:28.808 --> 13:30.210
YOUR COLOR'S COMING BACK.

13:30.210 --> 13:33.213
WELL, MAYBE NOT IN YOUR FACE,
BUT LOOK AT YOUR HANDS.

13:33.213 --> 13:36.046
THEY'RE PURPLE.
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

13:36.046 --> 13:39.189
COOL, COOL PORCELAIN.
DO YOU WANT ME TO GET YOU
A GINGER ALE?

13:39.189 --> 13:42.192
OR WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO STAY
HERE SO YOU CAN FINISH

13:42.192 --> 13:44.594
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING BEFORE?
(retches)

13:44.594 --> 13:46.997
OH, GOD.

13:46.997 --> 13:50.000
I-I GET A LITTLE SICK WHEN
I HEAR OTHER PEOPLE THROW UP.
(coughing)

13:50.000 --> 13:52.903
OH. YEAH. YEP.
HERE IT COMES. (gags)

13:52.903 --> 13:56.066
(grunts) HOLD MY HAND.
IT CAN STILL BE ROMANTIC.

13:56.066 --> 13:58.108
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

13:58.108 --> 13:59.409
(continues coughing)

14:05.976 --> 14:08.078
OW, OW, OW.

14:08.078 --> 14:11.121
THIS SOFT, FLEECY BLANKET
HURTS?
UH-HUH.

14:11.121 --> 14:13.123
MAN. YOU'RE
MY THANKSGIVING CO-HOST.

14:13.123 --> 14:16.126
YOU KNOW, THE FOOD'S GONNA
BE READY IN ABOUT AN HOUR.

14:16.126 --> 14:19.129
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE
THAT YOU MIGHT MAKE IT OVER

14:19.129 --> 14:21.861
IF I STALL FOR A WHILE?
YOU MEAN, LIKE, A MONTH?

14:21.861 --> 14:23.533
OH, BABY.
OW.

14:23.533 --> 14:25.265
OKAY.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.237
AH, BIG CARL.

14:27.237 --> 14:29.569
YOU CAN ALMOST FIX EVERYTHING.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.871
(clatter)
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU LOST THE RING!

14:31.871 --> 14:34.504
IT'S YOUR FAULT
FOR GIVING IT TO ME, LADY!

14:34.504 --> 14:37.307
JULES,
ARE YOU GONNA HELP LOOK?

14:37.307 --> 14:39.910
I KNOW GRAYSON'S NOT COMING
OVER BECAUSE HE'S SICK,

14:39.910 --> 14:42.312
BUT THANKS
TO THAT STUPID "I LOVE YOU,"

14:42.312 --> 14:45.015
I FEEL LIKE
IT'S STILL REJECTION.

14:45.015 --> 14:48.158
HONEY, WHY DON'T YOU GO
BACK OVER THERE

14:48.158 --> 14:50.560
AND JUST ASK
WHETHER HE LOVES YOU OR NOT?

14:50.560 --> 14:52.522
IF HE SAYS HE LOVES ME,

14:52.522 --> 14:55.125
I WILL ALWAYS THINK
IT'S BECAUSE I PUSHED HIM.

14:55.125 --> 14:57.527
PLUS, HE'LL RESENT ME
FOR PUTTING PRESSURE ON HIM.

14:57.527 --> 14:59.970
STUFF LIKE THAT ALWAYS
ENDS RELATIONSHIPS.

14:59.970 --> 15:03.373
YEP, YEP.
HAS ANYONE TRIED FRISKING
LAURIE? I MEAN, SOMETIMES

15:03.373 --> 15:06.937
MY MISSING STUFF ACTUALLY ENDS
UP IN WEIRD SPOTS ON HER BODY.

15:06.937 --> 15:08.578
SO NOT TRUE.

15:08.578 --> 15:11.081
REALLY? LAST WEEK--MY EARRING,
YOUR ARMPIT. IT HAPPENED.

15:11.081 --> 15:12.682
YEAH. IT DID.

15:12.682 --> 15:14.414
CHECK MY UNDIES.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.947
GOTCHA. (laughs)

15:16.947 --> 15:19.349
YOU KNOW,
I FEEL STUPID IN THIS DRESS.

15:19.349 --> 15:21.351
THAT'S ENOUGH.

15:21.351 --> 15:23.954
IT WAS FUNNY, 'CAUSE I'M NOT
WEARING ANY UNDERWEAR.

15:23.954 --> 15:26.056
I KNOW. I GOT IT.

15:26.056 --> 15:28.628
GUYS, THE ROMANTIC THANKSGIVING
IS OVER.

15:28.628 --> 15:33.233
IF YOU WANNA CHANGE CLOTHES,
GO AHEAD.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.965
AH. MM.

15:34.965 --> 15:38.268
I AM MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE
LIKE THIS.

15:38.268 --> 15:40.270
NO, NO, NO.
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

15:44.314 --> 15:47.677
ANDY, WE NEED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR SOMETHING.

15:47.677 --> 15:50.680
AND YOU KNOW HOW APOLOGIZING
MAKES ME RESENT OUR LOVE,

15:50.680 --> 15:53.683
SO EVEN THOUGH I LOOK AWAY
AND ACT LIKE I DON'T CARE,

15:53.683 --> 15:57.087
KNOW THAT I FEEL
REALLY, REALLY BAD. LAURIE, GO.

15:57.087 --> 16:00.290
YOU WERE SO ANNOYING WITH
ALL YOUR POSITIVE REGGAE STUFF

16:00.290 --> 16:02.962
THAT WE TOOK YOUR RING.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.365
AND THEN WE LOST IT.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.567
WHATEVER. I DON'T CARE.

16:07.567 --> 16:10.300
THIS IS SO EXCITING.
(laughs)

16:10.300 --> 16:12.172
WHAT?

16:12.172 --> 16:14.574
OH, THERE'S GOTTA BE A REASON
THIS HAPPENED, RIGHT?

16:14.574 --> 16:17.577
I-I CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT
WHAT IT IS. CAN YOU?
OH, BROTHER.

16:17.577 --> 16:20.150
I TAKE BACK
MY AWESOME APOLOGY!

16:20.150 --> 16:23.053
TOO LATE.
THANK YOU FOR LOVING ME SO MUCH.

16:23.053 --> 16:24.514
(clicks tongue)

16:24.514 --> 16:27.657
DO YOU HAVE AN APP THAT SHOWS
YOU HOW TO MURDER YOUR HUSBAND

16:27.657 --> 16:30.660
WITHOUT GETTING CAUGHT?
I DO. HOLD ON. I JUST HAVE
TO FIND IT. HOLD ON.

16:30.660 --> 16:33.663
HOLD ON. OH, HOLD ON. HOLD--
WAIT. I MESSED UP ON IT.

16:33.663 --> 16:36.466
I'M GONNA GO BACK.
HOLD ON.
HOW ABOUT--

16:36.466 --> 16:38.598
(laughs) SORRY. THAT WAS
AN ACCIDENT. ZACH! (chuckles)

16:38.598 --> 16:40.570
HOLD ON.
(makes creaking sound)

16:40.570 --> 16:43.303
HOLD ON.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.705
(chuckles)
NO, YOU HANG UP FIRST.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.777
(chuckles) NO. YOU.

16:47.777 --> 16:51.681
(deep voice) NO, YOU.
NO, YOU. YOU. YOU.

16:51.681 --> 16:53.283
PROBLEM SOLVED.

16:53.283 --> 16:55.385
I'M SORRY, TRAV.

16:55.385 --> 16:57.717
REDIALING.
(sighs) OHH.
ALL RIGHT. SCREW IT.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.320
I'M GONNA GO ASK GRAYSON
IF HE LOVES ME.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.792
BUT YOU SAID THAT
ALWAYS ENDS RELATIONSHIPS.

17:02.792 --> 17:06.256
THAT WAS TEN MINUTES AGO.
OH, BUT--

17:06.256 --> 17:09.729
OH, DON'T BOTHER. ONCE SHE GETS
LIKE THIS, NOTHING CAN STOP HER.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.731
HEY, JULES. WHERE YOU GOING?

17:11.731 --> 17:14.734
TALK TO GRAYSON. ASK IF HE
LOVES ME.ROYNEVERYTHING.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.506
OH, NO, NO! WAIT!

17:16.506 --> 17:18.108
THIS IS THE REASON.

17:18.108 --> 17:21.111
I AM SUPPOSED TO BE HERE
LOOKING FOR MY RING RIGHT NOW

17:21.111 --> 17:24.114
TO KEEP YOU FROM GOING OVER
THERE AND MAKING A TOTAL A--

17:24.114 --> 17:25.745
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NO. FORGET THAT.

17:25.745 --> 17:29.619
LOOK, YESTERDAY YOU GUYS
WERE HAPPY, SO JUST CHILL.

17:29.619 --> 17:31.221
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

17:31.221 --> 17:34.254
WHEN YOU ARE THIS OPTIMISTIC,
IT IS HARD NOT TO PUNCH YOU.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.655
SERIOUSLY, I--

17:35.655 --> 17:38.658
MY HAND IS LITERALLY SHAKING,
I WANT TO PUNCH YOU SO BAD.

17:38.658 --> 17:42.132
WELL, YOU COULD EITHER PUNCH ME
AND THEN GO OVER THERE

17:42.132 --> 17:44.594
AND RUIN EVERYTHING,
ORYOU CAN JUST BELIEVE

17:44.594 --> 17:46.596
THAT THINGS
WITH YOU AND GRAYSON

17:46.596 --> 17:48.598
WILL KEEP GETTING
BETTER AND BETTER,

17:48.598 --> 17:51.801
'CAUSE YOU'RE THE TYPE OF PERSON
WHO DESERVES TO BE HAPPY.

17:51.801 --> 17:53.403
OH, LOOK. (laughs)

17:53.403 --> 17:55.345
LOOK.
(chuckles) MY WEDDING RING.

17:55.345 --> 17:58.278
OH. HMM. THAT'S COOL.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.150
(sighs)

18:00.150 --> 18:01.611
WANNA GO BACK INSIDE?

18:01.611 --> 18:03.253
YES.

18:03.253 --> 18:05.655
(Jamaican accent) в™Є ME RING COME
BACK, THE JULES CALM DOWN в™Є

18:05.655 --> 18:08.588
ALL RIGHT. NO, NO, NO.
ALL RIGHT, MR. HAPPY PANTS.
в™Є GOT TO BELIEVE,
HAPPY THINGS GO ROUND в™Є

18:08.588 --> 18:10.590
TONE IT DOWN.
JUST GET IN THE HOUSE.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.192
в™Є DEE YO, YO, YO в™Є
NO.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.194
ARE YOU READY?
COUNT OF THREE.

18:14.194 --> 18:17.367
ONE... TWO...
HELLO? HELLO?

18:17.367 --> 18:18.768
(snaps shut)

18:18.768 --> 18:21.371
(enunciating)
IS YOUR GIRLFRIEND HAVING

18:21.371 --> 18:23.403
A NICE HOLIDAY
WITH HER FAMILY?

18:23.403 --> 18:25.805
LOOK, I LIKE THE WAY
YOU TALK, OKAY?

18:25.805 --> 18:27.777
I'M ALREADY STARTING
TO MISS IT.

18:27.777 --> 18:31.141
GIVE ME A TASTE OF OLD BOBBY.
OLD BOBBY-BAROO.

18:31.141 --> 18:33.143
(snorts)

18:33.143 --> 18:36.446
FIGURED OUT A WAY
TO SWALLOW THE KEY.

18:36.446 --> 18:38.618
I LOVE YOU, DAD.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.650
PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND ME
EITHER.

18:40.650 --> 18:43.253
THAT'S WHY I DON'T TALK
AS MUCH.

18:43.253 --> 18:45.395
HAVE YOU BEEN SITTIN' THERE
THE WHOLE TIME?

18:45.395 --> 18:47.397
ALL MY FRIENDS
MAKE FUN OF ME.

18:47.397 --> 18:49.799
THE ONLY ONE WHO DOESN'T
IS TRAVIS.

18:49.799 --> 18:53.303
MAKES SENSE NOW.
HE WAS RAISED BY A MUMBLY.
A BUMBLEBEE?

18:53.303 --> 18:55.365
A MUMBLY. YOU SHOULD BE
GRATEFUL YOU HAVE FRIENDS

18:55.365 --> 18:57.367
THAT LOVE YOU THE WAY
THAT YOU ARE.

18:57.367 --> 18:59.739
ARE WE DONE TALKING NOW?

18:59.739 --> 19:01.371
MM-HMM.
