WEBVTT

01:01.094 --> 01:03.005
Stop! Stop!

01:32.859 --> 01:34.361
<i>Access granted.</i>

02:05.726 --> 02:07.467
Alan.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.268
No, don't get up.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.499
You need to rest.

02:13.433 --> 02:14.741
I'm fine.

02:15.168 --> 02:17.239
You had a spinal tap. All right?

02:17.437 --> 02:21.442
You had more than a sample's worth of
cerebrospinal fluid taken out of you.

02:21.642 --> 02:25.283
Your body needs to replenish itself.
Well, when you put it that way... Heh.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.956
How is Sarah?
Did you do an MRI?

02:32.452 --> 02:34.489
Yeah, and it's...

02:34.688 --> 02:36.258
It's incredible.

02:36.456 --> 02:37.696
Her tumor is shrinking.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.967
So it worked?

02:40.994 --> 02:42.473
I thought you'd be thrilled.

02:43.096 --> 02:45.269
I am. It's just,

02:45.932 --> 02:49.175
given the circumstances,
I hope we did the right thing.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.115
It was a quick call,
but it was the right one.

02:53.940 --> 02:59.390
I can't explain the science
behind your transformation yet,

02:59.613 --> 03:03.220
but what you did for this girl...
I wanna do for everyone who's infected.

03:03.383 --> 03:07.126
You cannot give everybody
a CSF infusion. It'll kill you.

03:07.287 --> 03:09.790
The genetic study Sarah was
doing before she crashed,

03:09.956 --> 03:11.560
my cells are going to be the key

03:11.792 --> 03:13.396
to finally taking down
this disease.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.231
We can save these people, Alan.

03:16.897 --> 03:20.174
All right. But we need to
work smart and fast.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.745
This ilaria problem
will not go away,

03:22.969 --> 03:24.769
and I have no idea
how much time we have left.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.853
Set up a temp lab in here.
Go.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.248
I'll keep an eye on Sarah.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.415
Everything all right?

03:34.648 --> 03:36.594
I'm afraid not.
We have a serious problem.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.888
Medical emergency?
Is someone hurt?

03:39.086 --> 03:41.157
Worse than that, I'm afraid.

03:41.354 --> 03:43.561
People are disappearing.

04:21.528 --> 04:24.372
Dr. Kato went out
to look for some food.

04:24.531 --> 04:27.740
We warned her not to go alone,
but she wouldn't listen.

04:28.468 --> 04:30.914
That rat didn't crawl in there
by itself.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.311
What? The vectors are back.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.918
We haven't had a vector attack
in two days.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.144
Yeah.

04:37.377 --> 04:41.052
They're using bait,
setting traps now.

04:41.248 --> 04:43.751
They know food is scarce
and people are desperate.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.452
How?

04:45.786 --> 04:48.426
Viruses are not capable
of complex thought.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.965
Speaking off the cuff,

04:50.157 --> 04:54.003
I think these vectors represent
a new step in evolutionary virology.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.827
You make it sound like
it's a good thing.

04:55.929 --> 04:56.964
Far from it.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.940
This is an evolved virus

05:00.133 --> 05:02.739
that both changes the host
and <i>stays</i> active

05:02.936 --> 05:04.779
until that host dies
of other causes.

05:04.971 --> 05:08.646
It's created a new kind
of organism, a viral collective.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.682
They were dangerous before.

05:11.077 --> 05:13.614
What chance do we have
now that they've evolved?

05:43.043 --> 05:45.387
Right now, the vectors
are hunting us one by one.

05:45.612 --> 05:50.061
Very soon, I believe they'll stage
a large-scale coordinated assault.

05:50.283 --> 05:53.196
They will have to wait in line.

05:54.554 --> 05:55.624
Ilaria?

05:55.822 --> 06:00.362
I intercepted a message from
headquarters on Sutton's phone.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.800
How many?

06:01.995 --> 06:07.206
A strike team of at least
100 mercenaries, well-armed.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.505
That's not a strike team,
it's an army.

06:09.703 --> 06:10.841
How long do we have?

06:11.037 --> 06:13.347
Six hours at most.

06:13.540 --> 06:17.078
They will storm the base
looking for the virus,

06:17.310 --> 06:18.846
and leave nothing behind.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.685
But we don't even have
the virus.

06:20.847 --> 06:23.657
We destroyed it back at Echelon.

06:24.084 --> 06:27.031
Mortal life means nothing to them.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.598
Oh, as opposed to those of you
who can live forever?

06:29.756 --> 06:34.603
I know this is difficult for someone
with a finite number of years.

06:34.761 --> 06:36.604
I don't know what's worse.

06:36.763 --> 06:38.436
That you can stand there
lying to my face,

06:38.598 --> 06:41.078
or that you actually believe
what you're saying.

06:44.437 --> 06:45.848
Did you get a head count?

06:46.039 --> 06:47.575
Uninfected personnel, about 20.

06:47.774 --> 06:49.583
Plus five security techs.

06:50.043 --> 06:53.183
And we're not exactly well-stocked
with guns or ammunition.

06:53.513 --> 06:56.289
If we don't act now,
we risk full contamination.

06:56.516 --> 06:58.223
We need to gather
those survivors

06:58.418 --> 07:01.024
and place them under armed guard
in the sunroom.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.928
No air ducts, one point of access.

07:03.089 --> 07:06.536
It's the only way to defend against
a coordinated vector assault.

07:06.726 --> 07:08.728
That only solves
one of our problems.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.910
How are we supposed to muster
a defense against ilaria's force?

07:12.098 --> 07:14.874
Defense is not the plan.

07:15.635 --> 07:16.739
I have placed explosives

07:16.937 --> 07:19.076
around the base.

07:19.739 --> 07:20.911
You have explosives?

07:21.107 --> 07:23.053
To detonate unstable ice.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.586
His grand plan?

07:24.778 --> 07:28.453
We draw ilaria mercenaries inside,
then set off the charges,

07:28.648 --> 07:30.821
implode the entire base
on top of them.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.121
But what about my team?

07:32.285 --> 07:34.925
What about the other
uninfected scientists? Vectors?

07:35.121 --> 07:37.465
Gather the uninfected,
as you suggested.

07:37.657 --> 07:39.068
As for the vectors,

07:39.225 --> 07:40.431
we are out of options.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.629
You still haven't
answered my question.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.173
What about the rest of us?

07:44.397 --> 07:46.673
We'll have to evacuate the base.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.240
No.

07:48.435 --> 07:51.746
There is a hidden bunker
underneath the base.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.580
Reinforced for earthquakes.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.918
We will be safe there.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.919
What bunker?

08:03.283 --> 08:07.493
We lost three people just this morning.
Doctors Kato, Wenk and Singer.

08:07.687 --> 08:10.531
Vectors are in the ducts,
in the elevator shafts, everywhere.

08:10.757 --> 08:16.708
Listen, the only way a vector can get
into this room is through that door.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.932
Peter came in
through that very same door.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.943
Not with armed security posted,
he didn't.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.446
Isn't it the arm of security
that got him inside?

08:24.604 --> 08:27.847
Philippe. Philippe, listen to me.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.543
All right.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.386
I think we got a message out
calling for help.

08:33.613 --> 08:36.491
All right? You're the only other
person who knows about this,

08:36.683 --> 08:39.823
so you help me
hold it together here,

08:40.020 --> 08:42.899
and we may just
get out of this alive.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.032
All right, Alan.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.368
You've entrusted me
with the safety of this base.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.597
Why would you keep this bunker
from me?

09:22.829 --> 09:26.834
There are things I thought
would never come to light.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.407
You're only telling me now
because you have to.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.943
I should have told you.

09:33.573 --> 09:38.613
Even if we survive the blast, how
do we dig ourselves out afterward?

09:38.845 --> 09:43.555
There is an escape tunnel
that leads directly to the surface.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.424
An escape tunnel?
For all the earthquakes, right?

09:46.619 --> 09:48.030
Daniel, I...

09:48.354 --> 09:50.960
I mean, Miksa.

09:51.958 --> 09:54.939
The world is closing in on us.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.630
You mean on you.

09:56.863 --> 10:00.606
The vectors are hunting us
from within,

10:00.800 --> 10:03.542
ilaria from without.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.577
I cannot do this without you.

11:09.102 --> 11:12.515
I'm giving the highest-caliber
weapons to my security team.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.878
The rest we can store
in this bunker of yours,

11:15.108 --> 11:18.214
in case there are any mercenaries
left when we reach the surface.

11:18.444 --> 11:21.653
Let's hope it does not
come to that.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.687
I remember
when you first brought me here.

11:26.886 --> 11:29.162
Taught me how to load a weapon.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.865
I was 5 or 6.

11:33.293 --> 11:36.206
Back then I used to think
you were some kind of wizard.

11:36.863 --> 11:41.403
All children must learn
their parents are fallible, not perfect.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.045
You made that part easy for me.

11:45.171 --> 11:50.382
You may loathe what I've done,
or what you believe I've done,

11:50.577 --> 11:52.318
but you are still my son.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.251
Am I?

11:56.983 --> 12:01.261
Your feelings for me
do nothing to diminish mine for you.

12:45.898 --> 12:48.105
Alan, take a look at this.

12:48.468 --> 12:51.608
So the double-stranded RNA
instructions delivered to all my cells

12:51.804 --> 12:54.284
makes them express
an all-purpose grappling hook.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.714
Which attach to any invader.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.583
Marking that invader for destruction
by my immune system.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.554
If we can isolate the genetic
sequence of instructions

13:01.748 --> 13:03.750
to express that protein
on your cells...

13:03.916 --> 13:06.897
We can insert the instructions
and reprogram the Narvik virus

13:07.053 --> 13:09.556
to destroy itself.
We don't have the Narvik virus.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.133
We incinerated it at Echelon.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.302
Oh, goddamn it, Jules.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.339
It was my call all the way.
This wasn't your call to make.

13:18.564 --> 13:21.272
I had a theory.
A theory that could get us all killed,

13:21.467 --> 13:24.573
not to mention the 7 billion
other people on the planet.

13:24.771 --> 13:27.251
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

13:27.440 --> 13:29.477
I know better than anyone
what this can do.

13:29.676 --> 13:32.088
I know it's the only way
we can help those people.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.280
How could you be so reckless?

13:34.480 --> 13:36.153
You're no better than Hatake!

13:39.285 --> 13:41.265
I guess I'm my father's daughter.

13:45.858 --> 13:47.701
Jules...
I know I'm right about this.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.441
We can save everyone.
We can get Peter back.

13:52.965 --> 13:56.276
If I'm wrong, I'll march downstairs
and incinerate every last drop.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.484
No. Not alone you won't.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.379
Oh, my God.

14:54.427 --> 14:58.273
Bunker will barely fit all of us.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.205
Bunker?

15:01.167 --> 15:03.408
These are living quarters.

15:04.837 --> 15:08.250
How long has all this been here?
From the beginning.

15:08.941 --> 15:12.718
Designed to be the safest place
on the base.

15:12.912 --> 15:16.359
Why? Why did you build n?

15:16.549 --> 15:18.756
Before I adopted you,

15:19.952 --> 15:22.262
there was another.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.933
Another son?

15:26.559 --> 15:27.765
A daughter.

15:29.362 --> 15:33.037
She was not like you,
not born on the ice.

15:35.234 --> 15:39.046
So you built this place
for your daughter?

15:39.739 --> 15:44.586
Her mother thought she would
need a place to call home,

15:44.777 --> 15:47.155
to make her comfortable.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.324
I did what was necessary.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.086
To fool her?

15:52.285 --> 15:56.256
To make her think
that she was somewhere else?

15:56.456 --> 15:58.458
To keep my family together.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.801
I thought I was your family.
You are.

16:03.729 --> 16:06.642
What was doesn't change what is.

16:07.967 --> 16:11.141
And where are they now?
Your wife and daughter?

16:11.337 --> 16:13.112
Where did they go?

16:14.974 --> 16:19.286
My daughter is here now.

16:20.947 --> 16:23.018
Julia Walker.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.258
Walker?

16:29.856 --> 16:31.130
All of this,

16:31.290 --> 16:34.533
everything that happened,
was all for her?

16:34.694 --> 16:36.105
To bring her back here?

16:36.295 --> 16:38.206
The CDC, Peter Farragut.

16:38.431 --> 16:42.607
All those people,
infected, dying, dead?

16:42.802 --> 16:43.837
It was all for her?

16:46.706 --> 16:48.014
She is important.

16:51.143 --> 16:55.057
I need her.
You don't need anybody.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.387
We're all just an experiment
to you.

16:58.818 --> 17:02.732
Life is an experiment.

17:08.528 --> 17:12.237
You know what
I'm gonna do, Father?

17:12.632 --> 17:15.010
I'm gonna walk this base,

17:15.201 --> 17:19.650
and I'm gonna check
every goddamn explosive charge,

17:19.839 --> 17:24.049
because I personally wanna make sure
that this place gets blown to hell.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.546
I did the computer models
of double-stranded RNA proteins,

17:53.739 --> 17:55.616
but I can't get it to work in vitro.

17:55.841 --> 17:58.378
Well, if you guys unhook me
from this, I can help you.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.353
Yesterday, you
were as good as dead.

18:00.546 --> 18:02.924
Let's make sure
you're not going to regress before...

18:03.115 --> 18:04.526
But I feel great.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.288
Sarah, we have it covered.
Do you?

18:07.520 --> 18:10.933
Computer models are only most
effective in controlled environments,

18:11.123 --> 18:13.865
and this situation
is anything but controlled.

18:14.060 --> 18:16.631
Okay. What do you have in mind?

18:16.862 --> 18:19.866
In a fair fight, Narvik will mutate
to repel anything, right?

18:20.066 --> 18:23.809
So, what we need
is an unfair advantage.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.710
We have to trust that
our treatment will work fast enough.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.249
No, wait, that's it.

18:28.407 --> 18:30.409
There is no treatment
that's fast enough,

18:30.610 --> 18:33.784
so we need to slow down the virus
for the cure to take effect.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.060
And we can do that
by infusing it with cryo-fluid.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.457
Did you just come up with that?

18:41.654 --> 18:44.294
Actually, when my feel
hit the cold ground.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.299
Now, where are my clothes?
I wanna get back to work.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.260
<i>Fire hazard.</i>

<i>♪ And ifs raining ♪♪</i>

20:12.912 --> 20:17.258
We need to seal off the sunroom and
track down Duchamp and the others.

20:17.650 --> 20:18.810
There is no more time.

20:18.884 --> 20:22.491
The vectors really did this?
The intelligence, the coordination...

20:22.688 --> 20:26.659
Are we the only ones left?
I've got four techs not infected yet.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.897
This was their plan all along.
The traps, the bait.

20:30.763 --> 20:34.006
The vectors wanted us to gather
the uninfected in one place.

20:34.200 --> 20:37.670
We gave them everything they wanted.
We cannot afford to look back.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.510
We should commence
the evac sequence.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.515
No, no, there is still time.

20:41.707 --> 20:44.620
Our only hope is to retreat
to the bunker and wait,

20:44.844 --> 20:48.553
then eliminate both threats
with one blast.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.752
So everyone else dies?
We have done all we can.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.124
No. We've finally
cracked the antiviral.

20:54.286 --> 20:56.129
And until ilaria get here,

20:56.355 --> 20:59.598
we're going to help
everyone we can, including vectors.

20:59.792 --> 21:03.797
You need to ask yourself,
are they worth saving?

21:04.029 --> 21:06.031
Interesting question
considering the source.

21:06.232 --> 21:09.770
The have murdered and maimed,
stolen the lives of others.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.472
These are people, human beings.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.082
Really?

21:14.807 --> 21:17.651
Your brother
paid me a visit yesterday.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.380
Only now do I understand why.

21:21.914 --> 21:25.259
It was a warning. He knew
what they were going to do.

21:25.451 --> 21:28.557
I should have put Peter down
when I had the chance.

21:28.754 --> 21:30.791
You...
Enough! That's enough!

21:31.423 --> 21:35.098
In the last 11 days, I have been
attacked, infected, left for dead,

21:35.294 --> 21:37.103
and crated like an animal.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.300
Not to mention being transformed
from the inside out.

21:40.499 --> 21:43.776
I'm not gonna stand here and watch
my father and my ex-husband

21:43.936 --> 21:47.076
behave like two schoolyard bullies.
Your father? What-f?

21:49.275 --> 21:51.846
The vectors are working together.

21:52.077 --> 21:56.287
If we cant manage that,
maybe we don't deserve to survive.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.166
The infection is similar
to rabies.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.931
Normally, we'd treat it
by coating the lymphatic tissue.

22:09.094 --> 22:11.005
With an oral vaccine, of course.

22:11.197 --> 22:14.144
Do you just expect them
to line up and say "ah"?

22:14.333 --> 22:15.937
No, we do it old-school.

22:16.135 --> 22:17.546
Bypass the mouth entirely

22:17.770 --> 22:21.183
by way of an intramuscular
injection into the stomach.

22:21.373 --> 22:23.444
Abdominal absorption
works slowly.

22:23.642 --> 22:25.986
Not if you've bonded
the right protein accelerants.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.488
It won't be immediate,
but it should work quickly.

22:30.816 --> 22:32.295
It better.

22:36.455 --> 22:39.629
We know that extreme cold slows the
virus, and likewise the vectors.

22:39.825 --> 22:41.236
Dr. Jordan had the idea

22:41.393 --> 22:44.374
of infusing the cure
into a low-temperature solution,

22:44.530 --> 22:48.000
giving the antiviral time
to outperform the virus.

23:18.697 --> 23:22.235
And how do you plan to get close
enough to inject the vectors?

23:22.434 --> 23:26.211
We've done it before. We'll shut off the
power, chill the base to below freezing.

23:26.405 --> 23:29.784
If we cut the main power supply, the
perimeter alert system will go dark.

23:30.009 --> 23:32.580
We can't be blind
with ilaria a couple hours out.

23:33.579 --> 23:37.049
Then the cure must be administered
one vector at a time.

23:41.287 --> 23:45.360
It's too bad we can't just wheel these
out and douse them all with cryo-fluid.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.627
Maybe we can.

23:49.561 --> 23:50.869
It's called ARCA.

23:51.063 --> 23:53.407
Indonesian for statue.
It's a...

23:53.599 --> 23:56.910
It's a prototype to spread topical
antidotes for chemical attacks.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.977
ARCA can harness most
compounds at any temperature.

24:00.205 --> 24:02.617
All you need to do
is adjust the settings.

24:03.475 --> 24:06.149
I was not aware of this research.

24:06.378 --> 24:07.982
What lab did this come from?

24:08.447 --> 24:11.792
No lab. It was just an idea I had.

24:13.886 --> 24:17.629
You created this ARCA?
One man's scraps...

24:17.790 --> 24:20.737
What the base discarded,
I repurposed.

24:21.226 --> 24:23.331
How did I not know?

24:24.296 --> 24:25.969
You had more important things
to do.

24:28.767 --> 24:31.077
So who's gonna do the honors?

24:31.270 --> 24:32.943
Julia and I will go.

24:33.772 --> 24:35.149
When ilaria arrives,

24:36.075 --> 24:38.487
you must lead the survivors
to the bunker,

24:39.445 --> 24:41.322
then detonate the charges.

25:16.482 --> 25:17.722
Now.

25:27.292 --> 25:28.327
Please.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.759
I think it's working.

25:51.984 --> 25:55.227
It is because of you
that this is possible.

25:55.421 --> 25:58.095
Oh, no, this is not
father-daughter bonding time.

26:03.429 --> 26:06.103
I thought we were immune to attack.
We are.

26:06.331 --> 26:09.107
But now they see one of their own
in danger.

27:04.590 --> 27:06.763
Hey.
Hey.

27:06.959 --> 27:10.133
We need to get patients stabilized
before we take them downstairs.

27:10.329 --> 27:12.331
I started grouping
according to condition.

27:12.498 --> 27:13.841
Most serious cases go first.

27:13.999 --> 27:15.637
Great.

27:15.834 --> 27:17.438
You okay? Sarah?

27:18.137 --> 27:19.946
It's just a headache.
No, look at me.

27:20.439 --> 27:21.975
Follow my finger.

27:30.616 --> 27:33.119
Alan, do you think this is
a reoccurrence of my tumor?

27:33.318 --> 27:37.164
No, I've seen your scans, and your
tumor appears to be in remission.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.199
But I am concerned.

27:41.927 --> 27:44.168
Don't worry.
We'll figure this out together.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.536
Okay?
Okay,

28:06.985 --> 28:08.191
Hey.

28:12.824 --> 28:15.464
Shh. It's okay.
You don't need to say anything.

28:16.995 --> 28:18.167
Why...?

28:18.730 --> 28:20.641
Because you need rest.

28:24.636 --> 28:25.706
Why me?

28:28.407 --> 28:31.650
I don't deserve...

28:35.080 --> 28:37.651
You were there, I had the cure.

28:38.083 --> 28:39.585
Good timing, I guess.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.212
Peter's resting.

29:03.675 --> 29:05.712
We need to talk.
Okay.

29:05.911 --> 29:08.517
It's about Sarah.
What about Sarah?

29:10.249 --> 29:12.024
She's having recurring symptoms.

29:12.384 --> 29:14.591
Um, nausea, headaches.

29:14.786 --> 29:16.925
You think she's relapsing?
I don't know.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.591
Once we get down to the cabin,

29:18.757 --> 29:21.033
we won't have access
to the right equipment.

29:21.193 --> 29:24.538
<i>Perimeter breach. Perimeter breach.</i>

29:24.730 --> 29:27.142
This is it. ilaria is here.
Perimeter breach.

29:27.366 --> 29:28.777
<i>Perimeter breach.</i>

29:29.201 --> 29:31.374
<i>Perimeter breach. Perimeter breach.</i>

29:31.570 --> 29:34.380
Start getting people to the cabin, now.
Okay.

29:36.241 --> 29:38.983
<i>Perimeter breach. Perimeter breach.</i>

29:39.211 --> 29:43.091
<i>Perimeter breach. Perimeter breach.</i>

29:44.449 --> 29:47.396
The alarm was tripped
a mile from the base entrance.

29:47.586 --> 29:49.463
Is that enough time
to get downstairs?

29:49.655 --> 29:52.602
We can use firepower
to buy us a little more time.

30:09.308 --> 30:10.753
I see something.

30:11.943 --> 30:13.183
Headlights.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.321
How many?

30:23.822 --> 30:24.926
They are here.

30:32.197 --> 30:33.767
Wait until they get closer.

30:33.965 --> 30:35.444
We don't wanna waste any ammo.

30:39.137 --> 30:40.775
Steady.

30:41.773 --> 30:42.877
Steady.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.651
Almost there.

30:46.545 --> 30:47.717
Now hold.

30:49.214 --> 30:50.852
Hold...

30:51.049 --> 30:52.687
<i>and...!</i>

30:58.690 --> 31:00.294
Why have they stopped?

31:00.625 --> 31:03.128
Perhaps they did not
want to be heard.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.737
I'm not seeing anyone.

31:08.867 --> 31:12.076
My guess is they'll stick
to the high ground,

31:12.304 --> 31:15.513
just north of the base,
coordinate an attack from there.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.483
We should make our way around,
come at them from the south.

31:18.677 --> 31:20.918
Approach downwind
from their position.

31:57.783 --> 31:59.194
Where'd the drivers go?

31:59.384 --> 32:02.456
There never was a driver.
These are drones.

32:03.722 --> 32:06.293
This is... This is all wrong.

32:09.060 --> 32:10.869
No. Get down!

32:29.247 --> 32:30.453
It was a diversion.

32:30.816 --> 32:32.295
A diversion from what?

32:59.344 --> 33:03.087
As soon as Duchamp and his
group get here, we'll blow the base.

33:03.281 --> 33:06.524
My staff, the scientists.

33:07.786 --> 33:08.821
Almost all here.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.100
You don't understand.

33:11.456 --> 33:15.165
We must detonate. Now.
He's here.

33:20.031 --> 33:22.136
Who's here? What do you mean?
The strike team?

33:22.300 --> 33:25.543
No. There is just one.

33:25.937 --> 33:28.315
That diversion was for one guy?

33:28.640 --> 33:31.678
They call him the Scythe.

33:33.278 --> 33:35.383
- He is...
- He's <i>what?</i>

33:35.614 --> 33:37.685
An assassin.

33:37.983 --> 33:39.223
The worst of us.

33:51.897 --> 33:53.808
The call must have gone through.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.368
Are you with the Army?

33:58.904 --> 34:01.817
Come.
We're going down with the others.

34:03.675 --> 34:05.677
Finally, a good day.

34:05.877 --> 34:09.552
We're being rescued
and we have a cure for the virus.

34:26.931 --> 34:28.934
Level R.

34:52.389 --> 34:54.301
How long are we gonna wait?

34:55.560 --> 34:57.597
As long as we have to.

34:58.530 --> 35:01.534
If they're not down here by now,
they're not coming.

35:09.140 --> 35:11.279
Sarah, you okay?

35:11.476 --> 35:14.980
Oh, this migraine, it's killing me.

35:16.915 --> 35:18.155
It's not a migraine.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.991
What's wrong with me?

35:27.926 --> 35:29.303
We can't wait any longer.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.502
Do it.

35:58.790 --> 36:01.031
<i>Access granted.</i>

36:09.200 --> 36:11.271
Amateurs.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.118
The Narvik is gone.

36:17.308 --> 36:18.378
How?

36:18.610 --> 36:20.283
Hiroshi has it.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.389
Find him.

36:23.381 --> 36:24.792
What about the others?

36:28.953 --> 36:30.864
Exterminate.
