WEBVTT

00:07.724 --> 00:08.793
Emma, just wondering
if we could have a chat.

00:08.862 --> 00:09.689
When you got
on board the boat,

00:09.758 --> 00:11.448
you were traveling alone?

00:11.517 --> 00:13.310
Lana, you ready?

00:13.379 --> 00:14.689
I was by myself.

00:14.758 --> 00:15.724
It's a problem with
your credit card.

00:15.793 --> 00:16.862
It has been declined.

00:16.931 --> 00:18.034
What are we supposed to do?

00:18.103 --> 00:19.206
But we have no money.

00:19.275 --> 00:21.068
Can you point us
in the direction

00:21.137 --> 00:22.206
of a boat named "The Blue"?

00:22.275 --> 00:23.551
Yeah.

00:23.620 --> 00:24.448
Skipper,
these two found my wallet.

00:24.517 --> 00:25.793
Stroke of luck.

00:25.862 --> 00:27.482
We really need
to get to Mindanao.

00:27.551 --> 00:29.275
Apparently, there
were signs of trouble.

00:29.344 --> 00:30.655
Like what?

00:30.724 --> 00:32.310
Maybe something
didn't feel right.

00:32.379 --> 00:34.689
They were just a bunch of
travelers having a laugh.

00:34.758 --> 00:37.379
There's something
I'd like you to hear.

00:37.448 --> 00:38.344
"Blue." He's dead!

00:38.413 --> 00:39.448
He's dead!

00:39.517 --> 00:41.931
- Kitty.
- Where the fuck are we?

00:44.344 --> 00:46.275
Lana!

00:46.344 --> 00:47.517
What are you doing?

00:47.586 --> 00:49.000
I want to see
what's going on.

00:49.068 --> 00:50.034
Hey.

00:50.103 --> 00:52.068
What did you find?

00:52.137 --> 00:53.689
Can you hear me? Fuck.
Can you hear me?

00:53.758 --> 00:55.034
Do you recognize the voice?

00:55.103 --> 00:56.482
No.

02:05.275 --> 02:10.448
Mum.

02:12.241 --> 02:14.482
Mum.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.482
Confess.

02:16.551 --> 02:17.724
Confess.
Oh.

02:17.793 --> 02:19.379
Sorry. Sorry.
It's just a dream.

02:19.448 --> 02:22.344
Oh, God.

02:22.413 --> 02:23.827
You OK?

02:25.172 --> 02:29.068
So there's still no sign
of anyone following us.

02:29.137 --> 02:30.448
So what?

02:31.068 --> 02:34.793
Which means
the bag's all ours.

02:34.862 --> 02:37.793
How much do you
think's in that thing?

02:37.862 --> 02:40.586
Enough to go
around and then some.

02:40.655 --> 02:42.068
Wow.

02:42.137 --> 02:44.931
Well, we'll need some drinks
to celebrate then.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.551
It's 7:00 in the morning.

02:46.620 --> 02:47.758
Weetabix and drinks.

02:49.034 --> 02:50.827
Yeah.

02:50.896 --> 02:52.344
Crew meeting on the beach.

02:52.413 --> 02:53.793
About what?

02:53.862 --> 02:56.344
Investment strategies.

03:12.965 --> 03:16.517
♪ All the things
that I ran from ♪

03:16.586 --> 03:22.413
♪ I now bring as close
to me as I can ♪

03:22.482 --> 03:27.758
♪ Ripping hotel sheets
with gritted teeth ♪

03:27.827 --> 03:30.551
♪ My montage of lost things ♪

03:30.620 --> 03:35.965
♪ My shiny ♪

03:36.034 --> 03:40.000
♪ Trinkets of grief ♪

03:48.172 --> 03:52.724
Rick.

03:52.793 --> 03:54.034
Has Aaron got the bag?

03:54.103 --> 03:55.172
Yeah, I don't
think he's gonna

03:55.241 --> 03:58.551
let it out of his sight.

03:58.620 --> 03:59.724
Race you to the beach?
I'll beat you. No problem.

03:59.793 --> 04:01.586
How do we get to the beach?

04:01.655 --> 04:02.655
You swim.

04:02.724 --> 04:03.620
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:03.689 --> 04:04.931
Whoo!

04:07.758 --> 04:09.000
It's shallow. It's shallow.

04:09.068 --> 04:10.413
That's why they
can't be honest.

04:10.482 --> 04:11.620
It's still deep enough
for stuff to hide.

04:11.689 --> 04:13.103
It'll be fine.
It'll be fine.

04:13.172 --> 04:13.931
I promise.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.655
You trust me, right?

04:15.724 --> 04:17.724
Yes, you do.

04:17.793 --> 04:19.655
Ready?

04:19.724 --> 04:21.931
I'll go first, OK?

04:27.517 --> 04:28.931
Come on, Kit.

04:29.000 --> 04:29.931
Come on, you can do it.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.620
You're going to love it.

04:31.689 --> 04:32.620
Come on, Kit.

04:32.689 --> 04:33.655
Get in.

04:33.724 --> 04:35.551
Get in, please.

04:35.620 --> 04:38.206
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

04:38.275 --> 04:41.137
Whoo!

04:44.275 --> 04:45.379
Hurry up!

04:45.448 --> 04:47.827
We're coming.

04:57.586 --> 05:02.482
Settle down now.

05:02.551 --> 05:03.448
All right, listen up.

05:05.931 --> 05:11.379
1 million peso,
about 20 grand U.S.

05:11.448 --> 05:14.896
There was also something else
in the bag

05:14.965 --> 05:17.793
under the money.

05:24.413 --> 05:26.931
What is that?

05:27.000 --> 05:28.724
They're uncut diamonds.

05:28.793 --> 05:30.034
Look, I'm no expert.

05:30.103 --> 05:31.551
But given the size
of the stones,

05:31.620 --> 05:36.310
I reckon they're worth
maybe 1, 1 1/2 mil.

05:36.379 --> 05:37.448
You hear that?

05:37.517 --> 05:40.689
You mean 1 and 1/2 million
dollars?

05:40.758 --> 05:42.103
Yeah.

05:42.172 --> 05:44.379
We stumbled across
a bit of a dead drop.

05:44.448 --> 05:48.172
Buyer leaves cash,
seller leaves drugs.

05:48.241 --> 05:49.827
Aaron, this is
a serious business.

05:49.896 --> 05:52.482
Yeah, it is,
which is why I thought

05:52.551 --> 05:55.034
we should all have
a bit of a sit down

05:55.103 --> 05:56.724
and discuss our next move.

05:56.793 --> 05:58.034
If Aaron's right,
we've stolen this

05:58.103 --> 05:59.689
from a drug
trafficking operation,

05:59.758 --> 06:01.241
organized crime
that no doubt is--

06:01.310 --> 06:02.551
Hold on.
You don't know that.

06:02.620 --> 06:03.965
You're just making that up.

06:04.034 --> 06:05.620
I'm speculating
based on the evidence.

06:05.689 --> 06:07.344
Well, if you're right,
then what's your plan, Shell?

06:07.413 --> 06:09.655
I say we put a
big rock in that bag

06:09.724 --> 06:10.689
and we throw it in the ocean.

06:10.758 --> 06:12.172
Are you fucking joking?

06:12.241 --> 06:14.724
You want to throw away
1 and 1/2 million doll--

06:14.793 --> 06:15.793
are you insane?
Kit, Kit.

06:15.862 --> 06:16.827
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Kit.

06:16.896 --> 06:19.379
Crew meeting, keep it nice.

06:19.448 --> 06:21.344
We don't know
anything about that bag.

06:21.413 --> 06:24.310
Stealing it
was a stupid move.

06:24.379 --> 06:25.793
OK, yeah.

06:25.862 --> 06:27.482
Maybe it was stupid.

06:27.551 --> 06:29.965
But I need that money,
otherwise I have to go home

06:30.034 --> 06:33.206
soon, start my regular life.

06:33.275 --> 06:34.965
Since I fucked up my knee,
what's it going to be,

06:35.034 --> 06:37.034
a shitty job
in a shitty office?

06:37.103 --> 06:38.482
Hey, it's not just Rick.

06:38.551 --> 06:41.275
We're all going to run
out of cash eventually.

06:41.344 --> 06:45.931
And no one wants
to go home yet, right?

06:47.517 --> 06:52.586
So if it means we keep
sailing, I vote we keep it.

06:52.655 --> 06:53.620
Whoa, wait.

06:53.689 --> 06:55.655
This isn't a vote.

06:55.724 --> 06:56.827
Aaron, you should call this.

06:56.896 --> 06:59.586
This isn't about the boat.

06:59.655 --> 07:01.586
We should all get a say.

07:06.137 --> 07:07.965
She's right.

07:08.034 --> 07:09.000
Yeah, you're right, OK?

07:09.068 --> 07:10.344
This is a vote.

07:10.413 --> 07:14.275
So all those
who would like to keep it.

07:31.689 --> 07:34.517
5 to 1.

07:34.586 --> 07:35.620
Sorry, Shell.

07:35.689 --> 07:38.793
I guess it's decided, then.

07:38.862 --> 07:40.310
I'll put this away
for safekeeping.

07:40.379 --> 07:43.448
We'll use the
cash for expenses.

07:43.517 --> 07:46.517
Why don't we just
divide it up right now?

07:49.689 --> 07:51.896
Because that's not how
we do things, Lana.

07:51.965 --> 07:53.448
Well, why?

07:53.517 --> 07:54.482
We're all taking a risk.

07:54.551 --> 07:56.413
We should get the payoff.

07:56.482 --> 07:58.965
"The Blue" is a collective,
OK?

07:59.034 --> 08:02.103
So the money will be
held collectively.

08:02.172 --> 08:03.482
I mean, that's our philosophy.

08:03.551 --> 08:07.000
I thought you both
understood that.

08:07.068 --> 08:08.724
Kitty.

08:08.793 --> 08:11.413
What?

08:11.482 --> 08:13.689
Fine?

08:23.620 --> 08:25.965
Fine.

08:26.034 --> 08:30.310
Lana.

08:30.379 --> 08:32.655
Last night when we were
gunning the engine,

08:32.724 --> 08:34.103
she started blowing smoke.

08:34.172 --> 08:35.931
So first things first,
we use some of the cash

08:36.000 --> 08:37.137
to do repairs
on the boat,

08:37.206 --> 08:38.862
bring the old girl
back up to speed.

08:38.931 --> 08:41.034
And maybe we should
double back to Balakid,

08:41.103 --> 08:43.344
get some new engine
parts, supplies.

08:43.413 --> 08:45.413
Yeah, and then we're going
to put distance between us

08:45.482 --> 08:47.551
and that other boat to be safe.

08:49.931 --> 08:50.931
Good.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.068
Meeting's over, then.

09:03.620 --> 09:05.827
Den.

09:05.896 --> 09:07.379
Get rid of the bag, OK?

09:07.448 --> 09:10.413
OK.

09:14.689 --> 09:16.517
We should just grab
the money, because we--

09:16.586 --> 09:18.689
we need it more than them.
Wait. What?

09:18.758 --> 09:20.103
And we could get away

09:20.172 --> 09:22.517
before they even knew
to Laos or Myanmar.

09:22.586 --> 09:24.068
OK. OK. OK. OK.

09:24.137 --> 09:27.034
You were the one who wanted
to stay in the yacht, so--

09:27.103 --> 09:30.137
We've only known those
two for a few days.

09:30.206 --> 09:34.241
You think we can trust them?

09:34.310 --> 09:36.206
It's not them
I'm worried about.

09:52.586 --> 09:58.310
Yesterday,
before all this happened,

09:58.379 --> 10:02.689
I, uh, I turned my phone on.

10:02.758 --> 10:04.172
What?

10:04.241 --> 10:05.551
Why the fuck did you do that?
I'm sorry.

10:05.620 --> 10:07.034
We said--

10:07.103 --> 10:08.517
But I needed to know
what was happening at home.

10:08.586 --> 10:11.482
The police are looking for me.

10:11.551 --> 10:14.000
They know what I did back home.

10:16.758 --> 10:21.137
With that money, with those
diamonds, we could disappear.

10:21.206 --> 10:22.137
We'd be safe.

10:22.206 --> 10:24.413
Hey, you two.

10:26.379 --> 10:28.241
Before we sail,
Aaron wants someone

10:28.310 --> 10:30.275
to take a hike up there,
over to the other side

10:30.344 --> 10:34.137
of the island,
look around,

10:34.206 --> 10:36.310
make double sure
we weren't followed.

10:36.379 --> 10:39.275
I'm taking Joseph and Rick.

10:42.275 --> 10:46.793
Yeah, I'll come,
check out the view.

10:46.862 --> 10:49.310
Five minutes.

10:52.620 --> 10:53.793
The fucking view.

10:53.862 --> 10:55.206
Well, even if we
could get the bag,

10:55.275 --> 10:56.482
we can't get off
this fucking island.

10:56.551 --> 10:58.275
So we're going to have to wait.

10:58.344 --> 10:59.965
Look, I need to hear
what they say

11:00.034 --> 11:02.862
when Aaron's not around.

11:02.931 --> 11:04.275
You should go back
to the yacht and see

11:04.344 --> 11:07.103
where he stashes the bag.

11:07.172 --> 11:09.862
OK?

11:09.931 --> 11:11.758
So we're doing it.

11:11.827 --> 11:16.517
Yeah, we have to now.

11:20.620 --> 11:22.103
I'm not going
to be able to come back

11:22.172 --> 11:24.172
from my afternoon shift.
I'm really sorry.

11:24.241 --> 11:27.896
I just-- yeah, I get that.

11:27.965 --> 11:30.448
But I'm--

11:34.172 --> 11:36.586
Do you know what?
Fuck it. I quit.

11:39.517 --> 11:41.034
Go and wait in there.

11:41.103 --> 11:44.206
Thank you.

11:48.000 --> 11:48.965
You're still here?

11:49.034 --> 11:51.379
Has something happened?

11:51.448 --> 11:53.413
Search and rescue
have found a body.

11:53.482 --> 11:55.827
The voice on that
recording that you played me,

11:55.896 --> 11:57.551
is it the same person?

11:57.620 --> 11:59.448
Well, they're flying
the body in now.

11:59.517 --> 12:03.413
Once that's been ID'd, the
next of kin will be told and--

12:03.482 --> 12:05.689
hey, just take a seat here.

12:05.758 --> 12:07.172
All right?

12:07.241 --> 12:08.413
I'll make sure you're
the next to know.

12:08.482 --> 12:10.896
OK?
OK.

12:30.034 --> 12:31.137
Sorry.

12:31.206 --> 12:32.344
They asked me to wait in here.

12:32.413 --> 12:33.965
Oh that's fine.

12:34.034 --> 12:35.931
We're waiting too.

12:43.517 --> 12:46.482
Are you also
connected to "The Blue"?

12:46.551 --> 12:49.034
I sailed with them
back in the Philippines.

12:49.103 --> 12:50.724
I'm Emma.

12:50.793 --> 12:52.827
Rachel Winbourne,
and this is Peter.

12:52.896 --> 12:55.551
We're Denny
and Aaron's parents.

12:55.620 --> 12:59.241
So good to meet someone
who knows our boys.

13:11.620 --> 13:13.310
I heard
the rescue people found

13:13.379 --> 13:14.827
a crew member in the water.

13:14.896 --> 13:16.586
I don't know if you
know if it was a man.

13:16.655 --> 13:18.034
Oh, they haven't
told us anything.

13:19.655 --> 13:20.896
I don't think they
know much themselves yet.

13:20.965 --> 13:24.206
Darling, it's my brother.

13:32.482 --> 13:34.862
So you're English.

13:34.931 --> 13:36.758
And you met my boys
in the Philippines,

13:36.827 --> 13:42.275
and now you're in Townsville,
the home port of "The Blue."

13:43.931 --> 13:45.620
Yeah, they always said
that Queensland was amazing,

13:45.689 --> 13:47.862
so I was traveling
around anyway.

13:47.931 --> 13:49.827
And you knew they
were heading back here.

14:12.620 --> 14:15.655
Is this your first taste
of Aaron's democracy?

14:15.724 --> 14:16.689
Yeah.

14:16.758 --> 14:19.551
Worked out fine for me, though.

14:19.620 --> 14:21.344
I also voted to keep the bag.

14:21.413 --> 14:24.000
But you didn't want to.

14:39.620 --> 14:42.310
Do you believe in karma?

14:42.379 --> 14:44.689
No.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.724
I think it's a load of shit.

14:46.793 --> 14:49.137
The Filipinos,
they talk about gaba.

14:49.206 --> 14:54.586
You do bad acts, wrong deeds,
you get bad consequences.

14:56.310 --> 14:59.827
Like God getting
a bit of payback?

14:59.896 --> 15:01.379
Right?

15:01.448 --> 15:04.034
It's nature balancing itself.

15:06.931 --> 15:11.034
So is us taking the bag,
is that bad gaba?

15:11.103 --> 15:15.068
Karma, gaba,
it's a pile of shit, right?

15:15.137 --> 15:17.241
So who cares?

15:17.310 --> 15:22.931
Yoo-hoo, up here.

15:37.724 --> 15:41.275
Michelle, teach Kitty how
to secure the tender for me.

15:41.344 --> 15:42.586
No.

15:42.655 --> 15:44.000
I'm hopeless
at that kind of thing.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.068
I'd rather--

15:45.137 --> 15:47.344
I taught Joseph.

15:47.413 --> 15:50.172
If he can learn, anyone can.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.655
No, I don't--

15:51.724 --> 15:54.482
If you're going to
be staying on "The Blue,"

15:54.551 --> 15:55.620
you got to learn this.

15:55.689 --> 15:57.689
OK?

16:09.862 --> 16:12.827
Come on.

16:19.241 --> 16:20.793
Hey, can you see anything?

16:20.862 --> 16:21.793
Any boats?

16:21.862 --> 16:23.413
No.

16:29.241 --> 16:31.862
There's no one following us.

16:31.931 --> 16:36.448
Not bad, eh?

16:37.862 --> 16:40.275
It's hard to believe
that it's New Year's Eve.

16:40.344 --> 16:44.241
We are going to
a party tonight.

16:49.827 --> 16:56.068
Over, under,
through here, and tighten.

16:56.137 --> 16:59.000
Now your turn.

16:59.068 --> 17:02.241
The other night, you said
you've been on a yacht before.

17:05.586 --> 17:07.241
Yeah, but I didn't
do any sailing,

17:07.310 --> 17:11.793
just a lot of drinking.

17:11.862 --> 17:16.241
I think you could be
a natural, so try again.

17:16.310 --> 17:19.034
You said you'd been
sailing round the Med?

17:19.103 --> 17:20.103
Which ports?

17:20.172 --> 17:21.172
Gobs.

17:21.241 --> 17:22.206
All the usuals.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.551
It's a bit of a blur.

17:24.620 --> 17:27.793
As I said, bit of a party boat.

17:27.862 --> 17:31.172
Prefer this, though,

17:31.241 --> 17:36.310
you know, the Philippines,
feels more real.

17:36.379 --> 17:38.827
Being real is important.

17:38.896 --> 17:41.000
Yeah.

17:45.344 --> 17:46.482
Whoa.

17:50.620 --> 17:53.482
Hey, guys.

18:05.689 --> 18:10.206
Holy shit.

18:10.275 --> 18:12.793
Holy moly.

18:16.241 --> 18:18.310
That looks pretty high.

18:18.379 --> 18:21.655
The rocks are slippery.

18:31.137 --> 18:32.275
Should I do it?

18:32.344 --> 18:33.448
- Do what?
- Jump

18:33.517 --> 18:34.551
Are you crazy?

18:34.620 --> 18:35.827
There's rocks down there.

18:35.896 --> 18:37.137
You don't know how
deep it is, man.

18:37.206 --> 18:38.448
Your head's empty,
man, so I reckon

18:38.517 --> 18:39.586
you're going to float down.

18:39.655 --> 18:41.724
Only one way to find out.

18:41.793 --> 18:43.068
Don't do it, Denny.

18:43.137 --> 18:45.586
Come on, it's too risky.
What are you doing?

18:45.655 --> 18:49.793
You're crazy, man.
You could die. Let it go.

18:51.103 --> 18:53.586
Ahh!

19:01.724 --> 19:03.965
Denny?

19:04.034 --> 19:04.965
Denny!

19:05.034 --> 19:07.137
Denny?

19:10.931 --> 19:13.068
Oh, fuck.

19:17.413 --> 19:19.000
- Come down!
- No.

19:19.068 --> 19:19.827
No way.

19:19.896 --> 19:21.034
I like my spine too much.

19:21.103 --> 19:23.137
It's deeper than it looks.

19:23.206 --> 19:24.448
Come on, Lana.

19:24.517 --> 19:26.034
It's amazing.

19:26.103 --> 19:26.965
I'm sorry.

19:27.034 --> 19:28.448
I don't think she wants to.

19:28.517 --> 19:30.655
She's not as crazy as
you, so don't force her.

19:30.724 --> 19:31.931
You'll never get
this chance again.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.620
- Hey, Hey, Lana.
- Hey, Lana, no.

19:33.689 --> 19:34.896
No, Lana, don't do it, no, no.

19:37.448 --> 19:41.724
Ahh!

19:57.517 --> 19:58.413
You all right?

19:58.482 --> 20:00.551
Yeah.

20:00.620 --> 20:01.724
Pretty cool, huh?

20:06.344 --> 20:08.103
Don't worry.

20:08.172 --> 20:10.931
I don't think they
can hear us in here,

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
at least I don't
think they can.

20:14.068 --> 20:16.310
Why?

20:16.379 --> 20:18.448
I wanted to--

20:18.517 --> 20:22.448
What are you after?

20:22.517 --> 20:25.655
I don't know.

20:32.517 --> 20:35.275
Idiot.

20:35.344 --> 20:36.586
Maybe we should go.

20:36.655 --> 20:40.724
Yeah. Yeah.

20:48.551 --> 20:52.448
♪ I am crazy for feeling ♪

20:52.517 --> 20:56.344
♪ So lonely ♪

20:58.034 --> 21:01.793
♪ I'm crazy ♪

21:07.620 --> 21:09.413
Aaron?

21:13.137 --> 21:15.275
Aaron.

21:15.344 --> 21:17.896
It's my watch.

21:26.448 --> 21:27.620
Like a drink?

21:27.689 --> 21:29.862
No, I'm good.

21:45.655 --> 21:49.620
Celebrate anniversaries?

21:49.689 --> 21:51.482
Like what?

21:51.551 --> 21:57.448
Weddings, engagements, death.

22:01.448 --> 22:02.793
No.

22:02.862 --> 22:04.310
Yeah, my old man
was always saying,

22:04.379 --> 22:08.241
anniversaries are only ever
about looking backward.

22:08.310 --> 22:11.793
And he only ever
wanted to look forward.

22:11.862 --> 22:13.827
Easy to say.

22:15.482 --> 22:18.482
He's retired now,
but he used to be a judge.

22:18.551 --> 22:21.965
I mean, literally,
judged people for a living.

22:22.034 --> 22:23.206
Imagine having that
as your father.

22:23.275 --> 22:27.000
Yeah, I mean, I kind of can.

22:32.034 --> 22:34.206
Sure you don't want one?

22:34.275 --> 22:35.413
It's good.

22:35.482 --> 22:39.172
It's a wedding present,
single malt,

22:39.241 --> 22:42.586
whatever the fuck that means.

22:42.655 --> 22:43.862
Yeah, OK.

22:43.931 --> 22:46.000
Go on, then.

22:52.586 --> 22:54.517
Bleh.

22:54.586 --> 22:58.068
What do you reckon?

22:58.137 --> 23:02.724
Not enough malt.

23:08.344 --> 23:13.137
It's actually my wife's
anniversary tomorrow...

23:16.724 --> 23:19.275
The night she died.

23:22.448 --> 23:27.103
Oh, God.

23:27.172 --> 23:30.482
I'm really sorry.
Ahh.

23:38.241 --> 23:40.103
You know when you went
over on that trawler,

23:40.172 --> 23:44.344
you weren't gone for very long.

23:44.413 --> 23:46.827
Well, by the time I
had got on the deck,

23:46.896 --> 23:49.000
the boys were ready to go,
so...

23:51.137 --> 23:53.448
Heinrich got the
bag pretty much

23:53.517 --> 23:55.103
when he got over there...

23:59.034 --> 24:03.000
Like he knew
exactly where to look.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.034
You and I got off to a bit
of a rocky start there,

24:12.103 --> 24:17.827
but I am glad
that you're on board.

24:38.620 --> 24:40.896
Man, there's too many
stingrays around here.

24:40.965 --> 24:43.000
They give me the creeps.

24:43.068 --> 24:45.206
Forget about them.
You're safe on deck.

24:45.275 --> 24:47.137
But people have
been killed by them.

24:47.206 --> 24:49.413
Are you scared, man?

24:49.482 --> 24:51.000
Yes.

24:51.068 --> 24:53.344
Yesterday it felt like
she was interrogating me.

24:53.413 --> 24:54.275
Yeah.

24:54.344 --> 24:56.172
Lana, are you listening?

24:56.241 --> 24:58.965
Shell, she thinks I'm dodgy.

24:59.034 --> 25:00.310
Why?

25:00.379 --> 25:02.172
I just got carried
away and started

25:02.241 --> 25:04.586
telling these stories
about yachting.

25:04.655 --> 25:05.758
About us yachting?

25:05.827 --> 25:07.413
Hey, you two.

25:07.482 --> 25:08.896
We're going to the market
to pick up party supplies.

25:08.965 --> 25:10.758
Coming?

25:10.827 --> 25:13.068
Yeah, I might come.

25:15.206 --> 25:18.034
Except we haven't got
any money.

25:18.103 --> 25:19.137
Yeah.

25:19.206 --> 25:20.551
Well, the yacht's not that big.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.137
We could wait for
them to all get ashore,

25:22.206 --> 25:23.896
then we can have a proper
look for the bag.

25:23.965 --> 25:25.517
Aaron's always down there
working on the fucking motor.

25:25.586 --> 25:29.172
We'll get a chance,
eventually.

25:29.241 --> 25:33.000
I'm getting some money
while we still can.

25:39.758 --> 25:43.034
Aaron, you want a beer?

25:43.103 --> 25:45.793
I'd love one.

25:45.862 --> 25:47.827
Hey, do you want one, Joseph?

25:47.896 --> 25:49.241
OK.

25:49.310 --> 25:50.965
Can you ask Heinrich
if he wants one too?

25:51.034 --> 25:54.379
- Oh.
- Thanks.

26:00.448 --> 26:03.827
Is Denny going
to come with us?

26:54.034 --> 26:55.000
Sorry.

26:55.068 --> 26:56.517
I-- I-- I knocked.

26:56.586 --> 27:01.448
I thought-- I thought
you were in there.

27:01.517 --> 27:03.724
You want something?

27:03.793 --> 27:05.551
I-- we're all
going to the market.

27:05.620 --> 27:09.448
I thought you'd want to come.

27:11.275 --> 27:13.482
Got a bit of work to do.

27:14.620 --> 27:19.103
Sorry.

27:19.172 --> 27:21.620
Look, since it's
New Year's tonight,

27:21.689 --> 27:24.000
I dug out a bit of cash.

27:24.068 --> 27:27.551
You can probably divvy it up
amongst the crew if you like.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.862
I would've got more,
but it's a small town.

27:35.931 --> 27:37.965
And you don't need to
draw attention.

27:38.034 --> 27:41.517
Yeah, I'll tell them not
to spend it all at once.

27:51.137 --> 27:56.034
See their tails?

27:56.103 --> 27:59.310
They're evil.

27:59.379 --> 28:00.793
You still staring
at the rays, mate?

28:00.862 --> 28:01.896
Yeah.

28:01.965 --> 28:03.931
Rick's got a bit of a phobia.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.206
They're harmless, Ricky.

28:05.275 --> 28:07.586
That's what you say.

28:07.655 --> 28:11.758
Hey, I'll see you
over there, Lana?

28:11.827 --> 28:14.103
Yeah.

28:14.172 --> 28:15.103
Just waiting for Kitty.

28:15.172 --> 28:16.103
Hey, come on.

28:16.172 --> 28:20.344
Let's go.

28:31.655 --> 28:34.827
Found it, his hiding spot.

28:34.896 --> 28:36.793
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

28:36.862 --> 28:38.413
That's not all.

28:38.482 --> 28:42.724
20,000 pesos spending money
from our glorious leader.

28:42.793 --> 28:44.103
Shit, that's, like--

28:44.172 --> 28:45.827
that's, like, 300 quid.

28:45.896 --> 28:46.896
Yeah?

28:46.965 --> 28:47.965
And?

28:48.034 --> 28:49.379
We could go now.

28:49.448 --> 28:50.965
There's always taxis
at the end of the pier.

28:51.034 --> 28:52.551
We could be out in a minute.

28:52.620 --> 28:55.586
No, no, that dickhead acts
like he's doing us a favor

28:55.655 --> 28:58.344
handing us money that
belongs to all of us.

28:58.413 --> 29:00.172
How long would that
last us, a month?

29:00.241 --> 29:02.448
If that.

29:02.517 --> 29:06.620
Tonight then,
we'll grab the rest?

29:06.689 --> 29:07.620
Yeah, tonight.

29:07.689 --> 29:10.724
While they're at the party.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.379
Got a lot of work to do.

29:32.448 --> 29:34.344
Ready to get started?

29:50.413 --> 29:52.758
Do we want to go--
let's go to this way.

29:52.827 --> 29:54.862
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:07.068 --> 30:08.379
How's the depth?

30:08.448 --> 30:11.551
Depth looked fine,
even for springs.

30:11.620 --> 30:13.965
Really?

30:14.034 --> 30:17.379
Feels pretty low to me.

30:17.448 --> 30:19.931
Why don't you take
another look?

30:29.068 --> 30:31.482
Hey!

30:33.413 --> 30:35.206
What the fuck?

30:35.275 --> 30:37.896
There's stingrays in here.

30:40.482 --> 30:41.965
Aaron, no, no.

30:42.034 --> 30:42.965
Help me.

30:43.034 --> 30:46.000
Come on.

30:46.068 --> 30:49.413
Hey, hey.

30:49.482 --> 30:52.413
Let me out of the water.

30:54.344 --> 30:55.379
Skipper,
let me back on the boat.

30:55.448 --> 30:57.034
In a sec.

30:57.103 --> 31:00.482
Want to have a bit of a
conversation first

31:00.551 --> 31:02.655
about what happened
on that trawler.

31:02.724 --> 31:04.172
I already told you what
happened on the trawler.

31:04.241 --> 31:05.517
OK, fine.

31:05.586 --> 31:08.034
Swim yourself back
to the pier then.

31:08.103 --> 31:09.931
No, no, no,
there's stingrays over there.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
I can't.
Let me back on the boat now!

31:12.068 --> 31:13.034
Yeah, OK.

31:13.103 --> 31:14.379
Calm down, all right?

31:14.448 --> 31:17.655
Once you've told me
the real story

31:17.724 --> 31:19.413
starting at the beginning.

31:19.482 --> 31:21.655
Fuck you!

32:15.689 --> 32:16.862
Can I get this, please?

32:16.931 --> 32:18.000
Thank you.

32:30.896 --> 32:32.517
See these?

32:32.586 --> 32:35.034
Aaron loves these things.

32:35.103 --> 32:38.724
Agimat. They're, like,
Filipino protection charms.

32:38.793 --> 32:40.034
Protection from what?

32:40.103 --> 32:42.413
I don't know,
sickness, lightning.

32:42.482 --> 32:48.344
I think you need protection
against pretentious Frenchmen.

32:48.413 --> 32:50.551
Why don't you like him?

32:50.620 --> 32:52.758
No, I do. I do.

32:52.827 --> 32:54.862
It's just the whole tortured
artist routine, you know.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.862
It's like, there's
bad shit in the world.

32:56.931 --> 32:58.448
I get it.

32:58.517 --> 33:01.068
But he's not the only
one with problems, right?

33:01.137 --> 33:02.068
How much for this?

33:02.137 --> 33:03.310
200.

33:03.379 --> 33:07.068
- That's a lot.
- It's not expensive.

33:07.137 --> 33:08.827
I only have 100.

33:08.896 --> 33:10.103
It's OK.

33:10.172 --> 33:11.103
Thank you.

33:13.551 --> 33:14.862
Thanks.

33:14.931 --> 33:17.172
Protection against
evil influences.

33:17.241 --> 33:19.103
No, I don't believe in magic.

33:19.172 --> 33:21.310
I do.

33:21.379 --> 33:24.034
Well,
then you should wear it.

33:24.103 --> 33:25.655
You think?

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
There you go.

33:35.241 --> 33:37.965
Yeah, I can already feel
the evil just fading away.

33:39.517 --> 33:40.827
It's amazing.

33:40.896 --> 33:43.344
Good.

33:43.413 --> 33:46.448
It is good.

33:50.724 --> 33:53.310
Like I said, I really
didn't mean to intrude.

33:53.379 --> 33:55.862
No.

33:55.931 --> 33:57.620
I apologize.

33:57.689 --> 33:59.896
I've been making you
feel uncomfortable.

33:59.965 --> 34:02.862
Prying is what
my wife would call it.

34:02.931 --> 34:05.896
I suppose I thought,
if you'd had

34:05.965 --> 34:07.724
any contact
at all with the boys,

34:07.793 --> 34:09.689
then you might have some--

34:09.758 --> 34:11.793
I've just spoken
to one of the officers.

34:11.862 --> 34:15.068
The helicopter's nearly
here with the body.

34:16.379 --> 34:17.620
And?

34:17.689 --> 34:18.862
It's a man,
a young man,

34:18.931 --> 34:22.344
apparently wearing
a distinctive medallion,

34:22.413 --> 34:27.172
some sort of Catholic icon.

34:27.241 --> 34:31.379
Does a medallion like that
mean anything to you, Emma?

34:31.448 --> 34:32.344
No.

34:32.413 --> 34:33.793
No.

34:33.862 --> 34:35.344
Mr. and Mrs. Winbourne,
we need to talk.

34:35.413 --> 34:36.965
Emma, can we have
a moment, please?

34:43.241 --> 34:47.137
Thank you.

35:20.310 --> 35:23.448
Aaron isn't going to come
to the party straightaway.

35:23.517 --> 35:24.620
But he is going, right?

35:24.689 --> 35:26.275
Yeah.

35:26.344 --> 35:27.896
I think he's going to get
there for, like, midnight.

35:27.965 --> 35:29.241
I heard him tell Shell.

35:29.310 --> 35:31.275
Why don't I get it?
I know where it is.

35:31.344 --> 35:32.310
It's fine.

35:32.379 --> 35:33.586
You've told me where it is.

35:33.655 --> 35:34.758
Anyway, I think
it's better if you

35:34.827 --> 35:35.827
stay there,
make sure that Aaron

35:35.896 --> 35:37.620
doesn't come back to the boat.

35:37.689 --> 35:39.931
And then meet me at
the bus stop at midnight

35:40.000 --> 35:43.172
when everyone's celebrating,
and then we run.

35:43.241 --> 35:46.137
Yeah.

35:48.103 --> 35:49.620
How do I look?

35:49.689 --> 35:51.068
You're worried
about your look.

35:51.137 --> 35:52.103
Yeah.

35:52.172 --> 35:53.068
It's New Year's Eve.

35:53.137 --> 35:54.965
I'm allowed.

35:55.034 --> 35:57.724
Come here.

36:02.551 --> 36:04.413
My arms are kind of shaking.

36:04.482 --> 36:05.724
That's fine.

36:05.793 --> 36:07.103
It's going to be OK.

36:07.172 --> 36:08.896
OK, if we get caught,
then we're-- then

36:08.965 --> 36:10.793
we're off the boat for sure,
and then we're fucked.

36:10.862 --> 36:13.862
Yeah, but I never get caught.

36:15.655 --> 36:17.620
Have you got everything?

36:17.689 --> 36:19.000
OK, give me your phone.

36:19.068 --> 36:20.586
Why?

36:20.655 --> 36:22.344
Because when we get the bag,
I'll chuck them in the sea.

36:22.413 --> 36:24.310
Fresh start.

36:32.551 --> 36:35.137
This is crazy.

36:41.931 --> 36:46.827
Hey, check this out.
Party.

37:33.724 --> 37:37.344

38:12.379 --> 38:13.310
Come on, Ricky.

38:13.379 --> 38:14.862
OK, final offer.

38:14.931 --> 38:17.206
"Under Pressure,"
I'm Bowie, you do backups.

38:17.275 --> 38:19.551
Denny,
I don't want to do karaoke.

38:19.620 --> 38:21.896
What's up, man?

38:21.965 --> 38:23.793
Guys,
emergency supplies.

What do you think?

38:29.172 --> 38:30.310
Oh, yeah.

38:30.379 --> 38:31.344
Heiny?

38:31.413 --> 38:32.620
Got you something.

38:32.689 --> 38:35.137
Yeah, Heiny's not drinking.

38:35.206 --> 38:35.965
Heiny.

38:36.034 --> 38:38.379
I said I'm fine, OK?

38:38.448 --> 38:42.379
Stop.

38:44.172 --> 38:45.862
OK.

38:48.275 --> 38:51.448

You want--yeah?

38:55.172 --> 38:56.000
Joseph?

38:56.068 --> 38:58.206
Yeah.

39:06.793 --> 39:08.413
That is so good.

39:08.482 --> 39:11.068
That's so good.
I think maybe, um...

39:14.448 --> 39:18.551
You ready?

39:18.620 --> 39:20.862
OK, we'll go now.

39:20.931 --> 39:23.172
That's it for the team?

39:23.241 --> 39:25.137
And you're gonna get on
that stage right?

39:25.206 --> 39:26.206
And you're going to come
with me,

39:26.275 --> 39:28.310
because we're
good friends too.

39:28.379 --> 39:33.413
OK.

40:18.137 --> 40:19.241
Heinrich told me.

40:19.310 --> 40:20.448
He told me, man.

40:20.517 --> 40:21.689
Heinrich told me.

40:25.517 --> 40:29.000
Ahh!

40:29.068 --> 40:30.241
Fucking hell.

40:30.310 --> 40:31.793
Where's my fucking money?

40:31.862 --> 40:33.931
Every time!
Every fucking time!

40:34.000 --> 40:35.551
Get off of him.

40:35.620 --> 40:36.862
Leave him.
Fuck!

40:36.931 --> 40:37.931
Me push you?

40:38.000 --> 40:40.862
You sound like Dad.

40:40.931 --> 40:41.931
It's not about Dad.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.034
It's not about me.

40:43.103 --> 40:45.482
It's you, you gutless prick.

40:45.551 --> 40:47.413
Fuck off.

40:47.482 --> 40:49.517
Fucking mongrel!

40:49.586 --> 40:52.034

Where are you going?

40:52.103 --> 40:53.103
Going back.

40:53.172 --> 40:55.413
Aaron, calm down.

40:55.482 --> 40:57.034
It's OK.

40:57.103 --> 40:58.275
Hey, we don't-- you don't
want to talk about it.

40:58.344 --> 41:00.068
We don't have to talk about it.

41:37.551 --> 41:41.103
Hello?

41:41.172 --> 41:44.551
Hello?
Oh, fuck.

41:59.448 --> 42:00.896
Hello?

42:00.965 --> 42:02.448
Hi.
It's just me.

42:02.517 --> 42:03.448
I was--

42:03.517 --> 42:04.517
Lana.

42:04.586 --> 42:06.793
--looking-- oh my God.

42:06.862 --> 42:07.862
Yeah, it's fine.

42:07.931 --> 42:10.068
It's nothing.

42:10.137 --> 42:11.448
Is it still bleeding?

42:11.517 --> 42:14.758
Yeah, I kind of
can't make it stop.

42:14.827 --> 42:19.241
Well, you need some ice.

43:23.620 --> 43:27.517
Aaron.

43:28.448 --> 43:30.689
Aaron!

43:32.482 --> 43:33.413
Come on.

43:33.482 --> 43:35.310
It's five minutes to midnight.

43:56.103 --> 43:58.448
So what happened?

43:58.517 --> 44:02.172
Bit of a dustup with Aaron.

44:02.241 --> 44:05.379
You mean he punched you
in the face?

44:09.827 --> 44:11.310
Yeah.

44:11.379 --> 44:12.793
He's got this idea that
there was something dodgy

44:12.862 --> 44:16.620
about that money we found.

44:16.689 --> 44:18.482
It was a setup.

44:18.551 --> 44:19.758
Was it?

44:19.827 --> 44:21.344
I don't know.

44:21.413 --> 44:25.241
I didn't think so,
but he's blaming Heinrich.

44:25.310 --> 44:30.620
And I try to stick up
for the guy, and--

44:37.896 --> 44:39.068
Come on.

44:48.586 --> 44:52.103
I see you're
still wearing that.

44:52.172 --> 44:54.586
Yeah.

44:54.655 --> 44:58.827
Oh, shit.

44:58.896 --> 45:01.758
You've got blood on your hand.

45:31.862 --> 45:35.034
Happy New Year!

45:35.103 --> 45:38.275
Fuck.

46:14.103 --> 46:15.931
Hey!

46:16.000 --> 46:18.655
Augh! Hey!

46:18.724 --> 46:20.000
What the fuck?

46:20.068 --> 46:21.000
No!

46:21.068 --> 46:25.862
Augh!

47:26.517 --> 47:27.689
- What's up?
- Asshole, he took...

47:27.758 --> 47:29.758
- What?
- He robbed me--

47:29.827 --> 47:31.517
- What?
- He pushed me down and--

47:31.586 --> 47:32.724
Where?
Where-- did you see him?

47:32.793 --> 47:35.413
I don't know.
I don't know.

47:35.482 --> 47:36.482
It's all right.
It's all right.

47:36.551 --> 47:37.551
No, it's not.

47:37.620 --> 47:41.068
He took our passports.

47:41.137 --> 47:42.103
OK, OK.

47:42.172 --> 47:43.586
Listen, listen.

47:43.655 --> 47:45.827
Kitty, we can fix this.

47:45.896 --> 47:48.689
We're going to fix this.

47:48.758 --> 47:52.379
OK?
We're going to fix this.

49:20.137 --> 49:21.965
Do you think any of
the crew had a grudge

49:22.034 --> 49:25.413
against Aaron Winbourne?

49:25.482 --> 49:26.517
Aaron?

49:26.586 --> 49:30.275
Yeah, the boy who died.

49:30.344 --> 49:31.655
Aaron's dead?

49:31.724 --> 49:33.000
His throat was slashed.

49:33.068 --> 49:34.586
He was murdered.

49:34.655 --> 49:36.655
And given there are only
three others on board,

49:36.724 --> 49:39.172
four counting our mystery
guest, I figured one of them

49:39.241 --> 49:43.862
might have wanted him dead.

49:43.931 --> 49:45.862
Well, they're towing
"The Blue" in now.

49:45.931 --> 49:48.655
Forensics will give
her the once over.

49:48.724 --> 49:52.068
And if there's anything
to find, we'll find it.

49:55.241 --> 49:57.793
Wait.

49:57.862 --> 49:59.620
You know, you asked me
to identify the voice

49:59.689 --> 50:01.206
on the distress signal.

50:01.275 --> 50:02.862
Yeah, and you told
me you couldn't help.

50:02.931 --> 50:04.793
That's because I
didn't recognize it.

50:04.862 --> 50:06.586
But when I was on "The Blue,"
I met a lot of their friends.

50:06.655 --> 50:08.827
And if-- if her stuff
is still on the boat,

50:08.896 --> 50:11.896
then maybe it'd ring a
bell about who she is.

50:11.965 --> 50:13.344
You said that they're
still in the water.

50:13.413 --> 50:16.586
And if that's the case,
then they don't have long.

50:16.655 --> 50:21.137
So maybe it's worth trying.

50:26.482 --> 50:28.310
Her passport was in it.

50:28.379 --> 50:30.137
So she fills out
this form, and you

50:30.206 --> 50:31.620
give her a copy of the report.

50:31.689 --> 50:32.965
She can take it
to her consulate

50:33.034 --> 50:34.517
in Timpi maybe.

50:34.586 --> 50:37.448
A British Embassy official
will contact her.

50:37.517 --> 50:41.275
They will need to
take all of her details.

50:57.137 --> 50:58.172
What did he say?

50:58.241 --> 50:59.517
You need to fill this form.

50:59.586 --> 51:01.482
OK, well,
we can do that later.

51:01.551 --> 51:02.793
No, no, you--

51:02.862 --> 51:04.275
you want to get
things moving ASAP,

51:04.344 --> 51:06.034
otherwise there's no
chance of it being found.

51:06.103 --> 51:07.862
No, we can just take this
and come back in the morning.

51:07.931 --> 51:09.275
Look, Kitty, we just have
to give them your details.

51:09.344 --> 51:11.689
Don't worry.
It'll be fine.

51:11.758 --> 51:12.896
I have to go.

51:12.965 --> 51:14.241
No, Kitty.

51:14.310 --> 51:16.206
For God's sakes.

51:25.620 --> 51:27.896
Hey, Kitty.

51:27.965 --> 51:29.724
You might not realize this,
but I'm trying to help you.

51:29.793 --> 51:33.137
Well, I don't want your help.

51:52.344 --> 51:55.655
Lana?

51:55.724 --> 51:57.068
Where were you?

51:57.137 --> 51:58.310
Where was I?

51:58.379 --> 51:59.413
Where were you?

51:59.482 --> 52:02.862
What about the money?

52:02.931 --> 52:04.689
Oh, it doesn't matter.

52:06.275 --> 52:07.241
Nothing matters.

52:07.310 --> 52:09.620
We're finished.

52:09.689 --> 52:12.206
Kit.

52:12.275 --> 52:15.000
Kit, I'm--

52:22.310 --> 52:25.620
You ready for this?
