<i>Request Homicide.</i>

01:55.640 --> 01:56.710
Hey.

Oh, for fuck's sake.

02:10.199 --> 02:11.520
Jesus Christ.

02:14.320 --> 02:15.834
Long night?

02:17.240 --> 02:18.754
Dragging anchor there, buddy.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.353
Dragging anchor?

02:24.480 --> 02:26.153
You know, the LT
is looking for ya.

02:26.240 --> 02:30.154
You need to take care of your own
pressing shit right now, don't ya?

02:30.280 --> 02:31.555
I got it.

02:32.640 --> 02:35.394
Hey, Bell, look, this is handled.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.233
What is this?

02:37.320 --> 02:38.320
What? You want us...

02:38.321 --> 02:39.800
Yeah. Come on.

02:41.640 --> 02:45.475
Shot three times at least,
from the exit wounds right here.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.670
With that?

02:46.760 --> 02:49.195
.38 dropped at the scene.

02:49.280 --> 02:50.280
Maybe a ghost gun.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.232
No serial, no prints.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.357
No witnesses yet. Look...

02:54.440 --> 02:55.874
Am I wasting your time?

02:55.960 --> 02:59.112
City's time. You have no role here.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.640
It's our scene.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.519
Who is it?

03:07.600 --> 03:09.353
No ID, no idea.

03:11.280 --> 03:14.478
There's a few of those.
Blown dye pack.

03:14.560 --> 03:15.914
We're waitin' on tech.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.176
All right, guys,

03:22.200 --> 03:23.839
start bringing everybody down now.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.193
Let's start a sweep.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.829
Look, Bell...

03:37.720 --> 03:39.074
Look, this is covered, okay?

03:39.160 --> 03:41.994
Just go... lie down.

03:45.200 --> 03:47.112
What about if I know who did this?

03:48.560 --> 03:51.359
Well, I don't know. Then we could
probably use that, Detective.

03:52.280 --> 03:54.954
I mean, you gonna solve this
right now then or what?

03:55.040 --> 03:57.077
Yeah, fuck you, too.

03:59.120 --> 04:00.998
Just leave her.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.992
All right, guys,
let's get this done, okay?

04:41.160 --> 04:43.629
You getting your mail here now?

04:43.760 --> 04:45.319
I don't get it. What?

04:45.400 --> 04:48.279
I'm saying,
apparently, you live here.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.591
Spend a lot
of time here, yeah.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.274
<i>Look at that face.</i>

06:06.640 --> 06:08.120
<i>You're hungry.</i>

06:09.360 --> 06:11.352
<i>Hungry, little mutt.</i>

06:12.840 --> 06:14.638
<i>You want.</i>

06:51.560 --> 06:52.789
Detective Bell.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.080
If I knew you were coming,

06:55.160 --> 06:57.311
I could've rustled up
more of a welcome party.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.995
I only wanted to see you.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.274
What's up?

07:04.400 --> 07:06.039
Silas is back.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.000
What makes you say that?

07:22.960 --> 07:24.280
Where'd you get this?

07:24.360 --> 07:25.714
I got it.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.680
Why now?

07:33.000 --> 07:34.354
Cleanin' up?

07:35.520 --> 07:37.751
Startin' again? I don't know.

07:39.840 --> 07:41.957
Well, we've heard nothing on our end,

07:42.040 --> 07:43.520
not since it happened.

07:43.600 --> 07:44.880
I need you to look it up for me,

07:44.960 --> 07:47.236
and then I need you
to forget you ever did it.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.958
I wanna be sure.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.512
All right.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.640
Hey.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.359
How's Shelby?

08:00.440 --> 08:01.669
How old is she now?

08:01.760 --> 08:03.399
Sixteen.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.837
Incredible. Really.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.990
I don't remember your kids' names.
Sorry about that.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.279
Come on.

08:18.160 --> 08:20.080
If this is gonna fuck you up
with anybody then...

08:20.120 --> 08:21.839
Then don't do it?
Fuck 'em.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.877
As far as I'm concerned,
you're one of us.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.633
Look...

08:25.720 --> 08:28.155
why don't you tell me
where you got this,

08:28.240 --> 08:29.336
all right?
And let me handle it?

08:29.360 --> 08:31.158
We can still keep it between us.

08:31.280 --> 08:32.600
I'm sorry.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.235
What happened was

08:37.320 --> 08:40.631
we put you and Chris in there
too green. It was a shit deal.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.677
You weren't ready.

08:44.760 --> 08:48.754
This thing has been ice cold
for a long time.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.795
You really wanna go down
that hole again for nothing?

08:52.880 --> 08:54.200
Can you run it?

09:02.240 --> 09:04.152
- It's a match, yeah?
- Yeah.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.277
You look terrible.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.710
- Had a rough night.
- Yeah, you had a lot of those?

09:13.160 --> 09:15.231
Did you ever talk to someone?

09:15.320 --> 09:18.836
Look, I do a Bible study
Wednesday nights.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.914
And it's a very low-key thing.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.599
No one's handling snakes.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.194
Think about it.

09:26.280 --> 09:27.760
It's good not to be alone,
you know?

09:29.720 --> 09:31.234
<i>Where did we meet?</i>

09:31.320 --> 09:34.119
Bar, Hemet, 2002.
Where'd you grow up?

09:34.200 --> 09:36.351
All over. Mostly Las Cruces.
What bar?

09:36.440 --> 09:38.113
Tappy's.
Why Las Cruces?

09:38.200 --> 09:39.919
Dad got transferred to White Sands.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.117
He left. We stayed.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.634
Why were you always at Tappy's?

09:43.720 --> 09:45.234
Bartender gave me
a break on drinks.

09:45.320 --> 09:46.754
Where'd you go to school?

09:46.840 --> 09:49.674
Centennial High, expelled.
Got my GED.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.638
Did half a year
at Doña Ana Community.

09:51.720 --> 09:52.870
Tossed for dealing.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.496
What was across the street
from the bar?

09:54.520 --> 09:56.989
Car dealership. Their sign
was a huge, neon bear.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.072
What was the mascot at Centennial?

09:59.200 --> 10:00.475
Hawks.

10:01.440 --> 10:04.035
What was the name of the bouncer,
the one with the hair?

10:04.120 --> 10:05.873
Martin. How'd we meet?

10:06.880 --> 10:08.075
Marlon.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.675
Marlon. Fuck.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.911
Fuck is right.
They can check that.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.434
Yeah, Marlon. Marlon.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.751
Okay. How'd we meet?

10:20.840 --> 10:23.071
We were both at the bar
trying to order.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.720
A Dire Straits song
came on the jukebox.

10:24.760 --> 10:26.200
You screamed,
"Who put this shit on?"

10:26.240 --> 10:27.390
I turned and confessed.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.352
We said it was
a Pink Floyd song, Chris.

10:29.480 --> 10:32.393
Well, fuck that.
I like Dire Straits.

Hey, Taz.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.230
Turn that shit down
so we can talk.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.656
Thought you liked country music.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.592
That's not country music.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.831
Well, my baby likes it.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.957
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.353
What else
am I supposed to do, man?

11:31.240 --> 11:32.276
I'm an involved parent.

11:33.720 --> 11:35.200
Where's Antonio at?

11:35.280 --> 11:37.556
- He's not here for this.
- For what?

11:37.640 --> 11:39.677
Murder weapon.
Smells like it comes from you.

11:40.160 --> 11:42.311
Oh. Say what?

11:42.400 --> 11:44.710
I have a body and a gun
that comes from you.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.917
No, no, no, you ain't got
no way of knowin' that.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.754
It's a burner,
no serial, spare parts.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.799
Somethin' you do.
So, I know.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.793
Not me. That's, like, fuckin' circular.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.791
I need to know who
you've been selling to.

11:58.880 --> 11:59.880
I can't tell you that.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.116
I got good credibility
with all my clients.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.755
Then I'm just gonna have
to review all your records and see.

12:04.840 --> 12:06.877
Now you know I don't got no records.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.110
Why you fuckin' with me?

12:08.200 --> 12:09.760
I wanna know who
you've been selling to,

12:09.840 --> 12:11.274
especially the crazy white people.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.636
Well, that's, like,
everybody I sell to, man.

12:13.720 --> 12:16.394
Anyone with a tattoo like this?

12:17.440 --> 12:20.990
I just told you.
You know, which is obviously...

12:22.000 --> 12:23.229
- The fuck?
- All right.

12:23.320 --> 12:25.016
- I'm taking these with me.
- The hell you doin'?

12:25.040 --> 12:26.952
What? Hey!

12:27.600 --> 12:30.115
Yeah, you want 'em back,
call me with names.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.880
- Don't do it, fool!
- Taz, what's up?

12:31.920 --> 12:34.037
Call me with names.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.839
You are fuckin' up right now.

12:37.160 --> 12:39.072
Don't make me have to notice you.

12:39.160 --> 12:41.311
Call me with some names.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.800
<i>Hey, partner, it's Antonio.</i>

12:49.080 --> 12:52.039
<i>If you want me to cover for you,
at least give me a head's up.</i>

12:52.120 --> 12:53.474
<i>Call me.</i>

13:04.760 --> 13:06.160
<i>All right, kiss me.</i>

13:08.720 --> 13:09.915
Why?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.320
So I know.

13:12.200 --> 13:15.079
I don't wanna look surprised
the first time it happens in public.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.357
Dead serious.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.474
Okay, got it.

13:46.360 --> 13:48.238
Think you can fake liking that?

13:51.200 --> 13:52.919
Probably, yeah.

14:04.840 --> 14:06.296
<i>I need to interview a prisoner</i>

14:06.320 --> 14:07.436

<i>End of last month.

14:33.120 --> 14:36.511
<i>The local scene is several
loosely-connected gangs.</i>

14:36.600 --> 14:39.479
We think there's a hard center
in there somewhere

14:39.560 --> 14:41.677
that's moved into armed robbery.

14:41.760 --> 14:45.720
We're placing our agent undercover
with a local asset, Sheriff's Deputy.

14:45.800 --> 14:46.995
This is her.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.560
This girl?

14:48.640 --> 14:51.200
She'll look right enough
next to our guy.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.913
- What's good, what's good, y'all?
- Hey.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.391
Our CI has a cousin
in one of the groups,

15:07.480 --> 15:09.756
a kid by the name of Toby Soll.

15:10.520 --> 15:12.079
This is my cousin, Toby.

15:12.960 --> 15:14.736
These guys used to hang
with Billy and all them.

15:14.760 --> 15:16.035
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:17.520 --> 15:19.955
Our CI will be making
the introduction.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.240
You wanna come to a party?

15:25.200 --> 15:26.200
Fuck, yeah.

17:00.640 --> 17:01.960
Course you're here.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.233
I was just on my way out.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.119
I'm just gonna run to the store.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.156
Yeah. Yeah, you do that.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.790
And, hey, just get
the cookies this time.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.190
I don't care about the fuckin' sugar.
We're past that.

17:15.280 --> 17:18.239
- We'll see.
- Yeah, we know what that means.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.359
How you doin', Toby?

17:25.680 --> 17:27.672
Oh, I'm incredible.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.000
Um...

17:31.400 --> 17:33.517
They released me
because I'm just too healthy.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.755
Hey, do me a favor
and turn that one away.

17:42.840 --> 17:46.231
The dirty, tall, beige one,
turn that so it's not facing me.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.997
You tell one fuckin' person
that you like owls,

17:51.080 --> 17:53.117
then every genius knows
what to get you.

17:54.360 --> 17:57.671
Oh, that cutesy-fuckin' thing's
gonna be the last thing I see.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.433
He's starin' me in the fuckin' face.

17:59.520 --> 18:02.558
How long you got?

18:06.320 --> 18:08.039
A couple months.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.358
Why the fuck are you here?

18:16.440 --> 18:18.557
Silas is back.

18:22.240 --> 18:25.472
I don't wanna spend my last days
thinking about Silas.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.313
I'm bringing him in.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.119
How do you even know he's back?

18:29.200 --> 18:30.475
He sent a message.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.677
Jesus, you're so fuckin' sad.

18:32.760 --> 18:34.433
It's already started.

18:35.640 --> 18:36.915
You're easy to find.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.719
I don't care.

18:38.800 --> 18:39.836
I'm a fuckin' dead man.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.832
Come on.
Do something good for once.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.513
I gotta believe you have it in you.

18:43.640 --> 18:44.640
I don't know where he is.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.616
And if I did, I would've traded that
a long time ago

18:46.640 --> 18:48.711
and taken my chances.

18:48.800 --> 18:51.235
You think I chose to rot
in Chino for 15 years?

18:51.320 --> 18:53.596
You chose to rob banks.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.911
Yeah, well,
I can't give you Silas.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.792
But I can give you Arturo.

19:09.600 --> 19:10.716
Arturo?

19:11.760 --> 19:13.717
We found ways to stay in touch,
just in case.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.672
- I can get you to him.
- Where is he?

19:18.920 --> 19:20.559
Oh, it's not for free.

19:23.160 --> 19:24.799
What do you want, Toby?

19:34.400 --> 19:35.550
Fuck you.

19:36.960 --> 19:39.919
You could have let me go.
Now this is what it costs.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.756
Bet you'd do a lot worse
for a shot at Silas.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.959
Move in front of the owls.

20:19.280 --> 20:22.830
Open your shirt.
Open your shirt.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.877
- No.
- Open your shirt!

20:43.200 --> 20:44.919
Spit on it. Spit on it.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.434
- Fuck you.
- Spit on it!

21:08.640 --> 21:10.518
Fuck.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.800
So?

21:22.360 --> 21:23.476
He's somewhere in the city.

21:23.560 --> 21:25.153
Somewhere!

21:25.240 --> 21:26.435
Yes.

21:26.520 --> 21:27.556
Where?

21:28.680 --> 21:31.673
He's at this little iglesia
on the east side.

21:31.760 --> 21:34.116
Cristo Resucitado, it's called.

21:34.200 --> 21:37.238
He just sits there all day giving out
free legal advice to immigrants.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.036
I guess he's...

21:41.120 --> 21:43.430
I guess he's got
a guilty conscience or something.

21:45.720 --> 21:46.949
What about you?

21:48.720 --> 21:50.518
How's your conscience?

21:52.320 --> 21:53.674
I didn't shoot anyone.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.736
That girl in the bank
was just fuckin' dumb.

21:56.760 --> 21:57.760
That was on her.

21:59.320 --> 22:00.320
Same with Chris.

22:00.400 --> 22:01.834
He didn't have to be a hero.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.195
No.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.514
He didn't.

22:07.600 --> 22:10.718
I mean, I kinda liked him,
but he chose to play, so...

22:13.120 --> 22:14.190
Okay.

22:18.200 --> 22:19.793
Have a nice month.

22:25.360 --> 22:26.589
Fuck you.

22:30.800 --> 22:33.360
We were family.

22:34.760 --> 22:35.671
Hey, Toby,

22:35.760 --> 22:38.195
I think you're lost
in the forest there, buddy.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.954
I'm not lost. He's a searcher.
My avatar is a searcher.

22:41.040 --> 22:42.269
- A searcher?
- Yes.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.397
You haven't even moved anywhere, though.

22:44.480 --> 22:48.554
I'll fuckin' arm wrestle
any of these guys. I will.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.753
I know it's in here.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.871
What's this game called?

22:54.960 --> 22:56.838
It's called "Up Your Ass."

22:56.920 --> 22:59.016
And I'm going to win this fucking game.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.599
New soldiers.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.797
- Ready for action.
- Yeah.

23:02.880 --> 23:05.395
Support the troops, huh?

23:07.080 --> 23:07.957
You gonna...

23:08.040 --> 23:10.953
It takes total concentration
and focus for this...

23:11.040 --> 23:13.680
- Yeah, sure.
- There we go.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.274
Now that's what I needed.

23:17.320 --> 23:19.039
What problems are you telling...

23:19.120 --> 23:21.840
You see, it's fuckin' telling me
two different things here.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.913
Involve a lot of searching.

23:26.360 --> 23:27.800
Look, guys, everyone
just watch this.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.274
- That's a tree.
- No, no, no, no.

23:29.360 --> 23:30.760
- Tree.
- That's a dead end!

23:30.840 --> 23:31.840
That's not a dead end.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.997
It's like the blind leading the blind.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.872
Very complicated problem.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.913
- Hey, Arturo.
- Ow! What the fuck, Silas?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.400
What the hell, man?

23:56.480 --> 23:58.278
Shit, turn it down.

24:00.880 --> 24:02.792
Jesus! Don't do that, dude.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.513
Let's see if it's your time.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.278
<i>Let's go! Let's do it.</i>

24:13.360 --> 24:14.919
Let's find out.

24:16.160 --> 24:17.230
Seriously.

24:19.440 --> 24:20.874
Right?

24:20.960 --> 24:21.960
Well, come on.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.160
Fuck that, Arturo.

24:26.240 --> 24:27.594
You don't have to do that.

24:27.680 --> 24:29.478
This really doesn't concern you, Chris.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.392
This is about Arturo.

24:36.280 --> 24:37.919
And Arturo has free will.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.319
It's his decision.

24:44.960 --> 24:45.960
His.

24:49.240 --> 24:52.392
All right, let's just...

24:53.600 --> 24:54.600
Come on.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.673
That's it.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.911
Don't do anything that makes
you feel uncomfortable.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.753
You know? No judgments.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.159
No, no.

25:14.120 --> 25:15.270
Look here.

25:21.280 --> 25:22.350
Do it...

25:24.040 --> 25:25.040
or don't do it.

25:31.640 --> 25:32.790
Do it...

25:33.800 --> 25:34.870
or don't do it.

25:50.880 --> 25:52.075
Oh.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.315
That's it. That's it.

26:11.440 --> 26:12.510
Oh.

26:19.840 --> 26:22.719
Fuck, man! You really have
to stop letting people push you around.

26:23.880 --> 26:25.200
Right?

26:26.640 --> 26:28.996
It's a loaded gun,
you fuckin' maniac.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.837
Aw, honey pie, go fuck this hero.

26:40.520 --> 26:43.240
- No.
- Go on.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.717
Go, go.

27:04.960 --> 27:06.952
There were three fuckin' bullets in here.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.554
Fuck, really?

27:18.960 --> 27:20.110
Fuck.

27:22.160 --> 27:24.231
Send him out
for lottery tickets, right?

27:44.120 --> 27:45.520
Oh.

27:48.760 --> 27:51.912
Fuck. Sorry.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.434
I'm sorry.

28:06.080 --> 28:07.958
Yeah?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.036
Shelby.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.677
- Who the fuck is this?
- It's my fucking mom.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.296
- Come on. Let's go.
- What are you doing here?

28:48.320 --> 28:50.277
A friend called. Let's go.

28:50.360 --> 28:52.317
Sorry. She's with me.

28:53.360 --> 28:54.714
Who the fuck are you?

28:56.200 --> 28:57.919
Come on, Shelby. Let's go.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.878
No. Get the fuck off me!

29:01.000 --> 29:02.593
Are you drunk?

29:03.800 --> 29:05.439
How old are you? Huh?

29:06.560 --> 29:08.040
23? 24?

29:08.120 --> 29:09.440
The fuck do you care?

29:09.560 --> 29:11.517
What do I care? She's 16.

29:11.600 --> 29:12.920
You ever heard of statutory rape?

29:13.000 --> 29:15.037
The age of consent is...

29:15.120 --> 29:16.395
You gonna tell me
about the law?

29:16.480 --> 29:17.680
- Mom!
- I ain't afraid of you!

29:17.800 --> 29:19.359
That's enough. Enough!

29:19.440 --> 29:21.193
- Let's fuckin' go!
- Mom, stop!

29:21.320 --> 29:23.596
Get out. Let's go! Out.

29:23.680 --> 29:25.672
- I don't care.
- You don't care?

29:25.760 --> 29:28.480
Yeah, bitch out with that badge,
you drunk-ass cop.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.711
Get the fuck out.

29:30.800 --> 29:35.158
She's underage
in your fuckin' bar!

29:45.440 --> 29:47.376
<i>Partner, it's Antonio again.</i>

29:47.400 --> 29:49.869
<i>Where the fuck have you been?
Call me.</i>

30:05.360 --> 30:06.576
<i>Dodgers back</i>

30:06.600 --> 30:09.274
<i>from a successful
five-and-two swing back East,</i>

30:09.360 --> 30:11.397
<i>including a three-game sweep
in Atlanta.</i>

30:11.480 --> 30:12.914
<i>Walker Buehler on the hill tonight</i>

30:13.040 --> 30:15.430
<i>to kick off a six-game
homestand at Chavez Ravine.</i>

30:15.520 --> 30:16.520
<i>Dodgers start...</i>

30:39.080 --> 30:41.879
Ethan!
Somebody needs to see you.

30:44.920 --> 30:46.752
She's out front.

30:46.840 --> 30:48.672
Fuck.

30:52.360 --> 30:54.431
I'm workin'.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.352
How'd you know I was here?

30:56.440 --> 30:57.635
Ethan.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.997
I saw Shelby last night.

31:06.120 --> 31:08.271
Yeah? Where?

31:09.840 --> 31:11.069
A bar.

31:13.800 --> 31:17.077
That doesn't surprise me.
I called you.

31:17.160 --> 31:19.834
Some nights
she doesn't come home.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.593
Shows up at school
for attendance,

31:21.680 --> 31:23.194
and then leaves, I guess.

31:23.920 --> 31:26.037
She's staying
with that shithead.

31:26.120 --> 31:29.113
- Jay.
- Jay.

31:29.920 --> 31:31.639
Did you try talking to her?

31:31.720 --> 31:34.080
I don't have a lot of time
for her fuckin' issues right now.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.200
Okay.

31:38.840 --> 31:40.513
I just pulled a case.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.114
So you want me to deal with it?

31:42.200 --> 31:44.078
Yeah. She chose to live with you.

31:46.440 --> 31:48.159
So who's dead?

31:48.240 --> 31:50.232
Nobody.

31:50.320 --> 31:52.152
A John Doe. It's complicated.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.719
It's always good to see you, Erin.

32:10.240 --> 32:12.550
I could've taken you to a nicer place.

32:12.640 --> 32:13.790
I like this place.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.320
Are you still drunk?

32:18.160 --> 32:19.276
No.

32:20.080 --> 32:21.594
Are you gonna keep stalking me?

32:25.400 --> 32:27.392
I have a right to know
where you are.

32:27.480 --> 32:29.233
I need to be able to find you.

32:29.320 --> 32:32.597
- Why?
- Because I just do, all right?

32:38.080 --> 32:40.151
Oh, are you kidding me?

32:41.200 --> 32:42.520
- Hey, baby.
- No.

32:42.600 --> 32:43.954
Hi.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.632
Scooch over.

32:53.200 --> 32:55.920
No. Come on.

32:56.800 --> 32:57.995
What's up?

32:59.280 --> 33:00.839
This is between us.

33:03.080 --> 33:05.720
So you don't think that
you did anything wrong?

33:05.800 --> 33:07.234
You hit me.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.517
But maybe you should go
to AA or something.

33:10.600 --> 33:13.195
A rage junkie, and shit.

33:13.280 --> 33:15.795
We're not talking about me.

33:20.120 --> 33:22.351
That's somebody else's fault, I guess.

33:22.440 --> 33:25.194
Okay. I need to be able
to have a conversation

33:25.280 --> 33:26.839
with my daughter
right now in private.

33:26.920 --> 33:31.073
I think she just feels safer
with me here.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.656
I need you to be
at Ethan's house every night,

33:35.680 --> 33:37.239
and I need you to pull it together

33:37.320 --> 33:38.913
and get your ass back into school.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.480
This is bullshit.

33:40.560 --> 33:44.190
Would you stay the fuck
outta this, you fucking asshole!

33:44.280 --> 33:45.953
Shelby, come on.
Come on, Shelby.

33:46.040 --> 33:47.040
Shelby!

33:48.000 --> 33:49.957
Shelby, come on.

34:01.160 --> 34:03.256
<i>The go-ahead run now 90 feet away.</i>

34:03.280 --> 34:05.715
<i>Turner at second.
Dodgers threatening in the fifth.</i>

34:05.800 --> 34:09.237
<i>Still nobody out,
and it's two and one to Cody Bellinger.</i>

34:09.320 --> 34:11.710
<i>Nolan delivers straight back.</i>

34:11.800 --> 34:13.136
<i>Oh, he just missed it.</i>

34:13.159 --> 34:14.639
<i>He'd like that one back.</i>

34:14.719 --> 34:15.835
<i>Nolan shakin' his head.</i>

34:45.080 --> 34:46.672
Can I help you?

34:47.360 --> 34:49.556
I hope so. I, um...

34:51.719 --> 34:53.518
I was told...

34:55.199 --> 34:58.591
I need to speak
to Arturo Guerrero.

34:58.680 --> 35:02.469
No. I'm sorry.

35:02.560 --> 35:05.439
Please. I know he's here.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.670
How did you find us?

35:08.320 --> 35:09.754
I need your help.

35:09.840 --> 35:12.674
Alba, she takes care of my kids.

35:12.760 --> 35:15.036
She...
She's gonna be deported.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.395
I don't know what to do.

35:17.080 --> 35:19.470
- I can pay good money.
- Look, I'm sorry.

35:19.560 --> 35:21.517
There are other places you can go to.

35:22.160 --> 35:23.719
I can't.

35:26.160 --> 35:27.674
I work for the government.

35:30.160 --> 35:33.790
Please. Please help me.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.393
Okay.

35:38.480 --> 35:40.039
Thank you.

35:40.120 --> 35:42.157
- You can follow me.
- Yeah.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.754
- Have a seat. It'll be a minute.
- Thank you.

36:32.360 --> 36:33.714
Arturo!

37:20.320 --> 37:21.595
Come on, man.

37:36.040 --> 37:37.679
Arturo!

37:39.120 --> 37:41.077
Stop.

37:41.600 --> 37:43.159
I just wanna talk.

37:43.280 --> 37:45.749
I don't know why you're...

37:45.840 --> 37:46.717
Okay, stop.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.678
You don't need to do this.

37:49.360 --> 37:50.510
I'm out.

37:51.320 --> 37:52.674
I'm so far out.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.033
Where is he?

37:57.120 --> 37:59.760
- What?
- Silas.

37:59.880 --> 38:01.678
Silas?

38:01.800 --> 38:03.234
I don't know.
Gone, I thought.

38:03.320 --> 38:05.357
He's back.

38:07.960 --> 38:09.360
How do I find him?

38:10.960 --> 38:13.600
I've been hiding all this time.

38:14.600 --> 38:16.000
Hiding from him.

38:16.080 --> 38:18.276
I don't talk to anybody.

38:18.400 --> 38:21.199
I'm not fuckin' arresting you.

38:21.280 --> 38:23.431
I'm not giving you up to anybody.

38:23.520 --> 38:25.716
Don't care about you.

38:26.960 --> 38:29.429
I just need to get him.

38:33.280 --> 38:34.714
Help me.

38:37.160 --> 38:38.674
Help me get him.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.317
Come on, man.
Give me somethin'.

38:49.520 --> 38:50.715
There's...

38:52.160 --> 38:53.355
There's a lawyer...

38:55.920 --> 38:57.354
DiFranco.

39:00.280 --> 39:01.555
Okay.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.274
He helps launder the money.

39:07.560 --> 39:10.155
Petra still sees him
for that every once in a while.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.913
Petra's still with Silas.

39:15.720 --> 39:17.598
Petra?

39:17.680 --> 39:20.149
DiFranco gets you Petra.

39:20.240 --> 39:21.594
Petra gets you Silas.

39:25.440 --> 39:27.352
So this is what you do now?

39:27.440 --> 39:29.397
Legal advice?

39:30.880 --> 39:32.109
Sure.

39:33.880 --> 39:37.430
So when's it add up to even, huh?

39:37.560 --> 39:39.756
It doesn't work like that.

39:39.840 --> 39:41.433
Then when are you done?

39:45.440 --> 39:46.874
When do you think?

40:19.440 --> 40:21.736
<i>You can come around
the side, Detective Bell.</i>

40:21.760 --> 40:23.080
<i>We're in the back.</i>

40:56.680 --> 40:58.797
Dennis DiFranco.

40:58.880 --> 41:00.536
You want an iced tea
or something? Cold beer?

41:00.560 --> 41:01.880
I'm having iced tea.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.156
How'd you know my name?

41:04.240 --> 41:07.039
"Pleasure to meet you, Mr. DiFranco.

41:07.120 --> 41:08.793
What a lovely home you have.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.837
What a spectacular view!"

41:15.040 --> 41:16.872
Arturo told me you'd be coming.

41:16.960 --> 41:19.634
And before you get all frothy,
he calls me.

41:19.720 --> 41:22.360
I have no idea where he is.

41:22.440 --> 41:25.080
And every time he calls, I call the FBI.

41:25.160 --> 41:26.296
We go through all the motions.

41:26.320 --> 41:29.836
I mean, y'know, I do know
something about the law.

41:31.560 --> 41:34.200
Ryan! What did Mike tell you
about your elbow?

41:34.280 --> 41:35.475
Get it up!

41:37.680 --> 41:39.512
Jesus Christ. All right.

41:41.320 --> 41:44.870
Why don't we get to whatever
you've come here to accuse me of?

41:44.960 --> 41:47.794
You're funneling money to Silas Howe,

41:47.880 --> 41:49.917
money from the Palm Springs job.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.356
- Is that what Arturo told you?
- Yeah.

41:52.440 --> 41:55.353
Oh, well, Arturo's a weak
and desperate man.

41:55.440 --> 41:57.830
I keep advising him to surrender.
He'd be much happier.

41:57.920 --> 41:59.274
Why does he call you?

41:59.360 --> 42:00.856
'Cause he's under
the mistaken impression

42:00.880 --> 42:02.553
that I can do something for him,

42:02.640 --> 42:04.791
money, favors.
I don't fuckin' know.

42:04.880 --> 42:07.156
Because you know Petra.

42:07.240 --> 42:11.439
Her father and I golfed
when she was in high school,

42:11.520 --> 42:13.159
so yeah, we were acquainted.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.880
She's a pretty girl. Fun.

42:15.960 --> 42:17.838
You had sex with her
when she was a minor.

42:17.920 --> 42:19.240
That was the fun, yeah?

42:20.360 --> 42:23.478
She got in trouble
a couple times. Drugs.

42:23.600 --> 42:26.399
And I helped her.
That was 20 years ago.

42:26.520 --> 42:27.715
Bullshit.

42:30.400 --> 42:32.960
Elbow! Fuck.

42:38.240 --> 42:40.471
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

42:45.440 --> 42:48.512
Petra and Silas
used you to hide the money.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.353
I'm guessing it's almost gone.

42:50.440 --> 42:52.318
That's why he's resurfaced.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.073
You're gonna tell me where.

42:54.160 --> 42:57.358
Oh, I am? Or what,
you gonna take me in?

42:57.440 --> 42:59.830
You gonna use Arturo's statement
to turn me?

42:59.920 --> 43:01.957
Can I ask you something?
Have you arrested Arturo?

43:02.040 --> 43:03.269
Is he currently in custody?

43:03.360 --> 43:06.159
And where is your partner?

43:08.640 --> 43:11.474
I think that you are
down here on your own.

43:11.560 --> 43:13.517
I think you're playing out
some little vendetta,

43:13.600 --> 43:16.559
maybe coloring
outside the lines a little.

43:16.640 --> 43:18.836
Where's the next money drop?

43:18.920 --> 43:21.879
I did some Googling,
Detective Bell.

43:23.320 --> 43:25.312
I know your whole sad story.

43:26.520 --> 43:28.193
The bank.

43:29.320 --> 43:31.118
What you failed to prevent.

43:32.240 --> 43:33.310
Oof.

43:34.560 --> 43:37.792
You know what successful people do,
Detective Bell?

43:40.880 --> 43:42.314
They get over shit.

43:43.440 --> 43:46.274
They move on, and they...
They build things.

43:47.960 --> 43:52.000
Big fuckin' houses on cliffs
in Palos Verdes.

43:54.360 --> 43:59.480
Would you consider your life
since Palm Springs a success?

44:00.800 --> 44:02.075
Where's the next drop?

44:02.200 --> 44:04.192
You ever see <i>Super Chicken?</i>

44:05.200 --> 44:07.590
Stupid fuckin' cartoon, old.

44:07.680 --> 44:10.400
No? Anyway...

44:10.480 --> 44:12.756
Every time they get in a jam,

44:12.840 --> 44:15.036
Super Chicken's sidekick
would start to complain,

44:15.120 --> 44:16.315
and Super Chicken would say,

44:16.400 --> 44:20.110
"You knew the job was dangerous
when you took it, Fred!"

44:21.600 --> 44:25.992
You chose to play cops and robbers,
and you lost... big.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.720
Silas is a murderer.

44:28.800 --> 44:31.793
You're barking up
the wrong tree, honey.

44:33.040 --> 44:34.474
And the more
you insist on doing it,

44:34.560 --> 44:36.552
the sadder and stupider you look.

44:36.640 --> 44:39.872
You know? Do you think
it was your stupidity

44:41.040 --> 44:42.315
that got those people killed?

44:55.080 --> 44:56.880
How did you think this was gonna go?

44:58.080 --> 45:01.073
Did you think you were gonna
roll up here with your badge,

45:01.160 --> 45:03.914
ask a few questions
with that hangdog look,

45:04.000 --> 45:05.957
and I'd just confess?

45:06.040 --> 45:08.509
Has that ever happened?

45:11.800 --> 45:13.473
Show her out.

45:21.880 --> 45:22.996
Oh, man, fuck!

45:24.280 --> 45:25.600
God damn it!

45:27.120 --> 45:28.440
In here.

45:33.280 --> 45:34.316
Fuck.

45:36.560 --> 45:38.119
Oh, fuck.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.673
Are you fuckin' serious?

45:42.800 --> 45:45.554
Clean this shit up.
It's disgusting.

46:00.360 --> 46:02.829
God damn it. Ryan!

46:02.920 --> 46:04.593
Your elbow!

46:06.680 --> 46:07.716
Ryan!

46:20.240 --> 46:21.560
All right.

46:39.680 --> 46:40.896
You wanna fuck around,

46:40.920 --> 46:42.400
or do you wanna compete?

46:45.440 --> 46:46.816
You wanna know,
'cause I talked to Mike,

46:46.840 --> 46:49.560
and Mike said we gotta just make it
about the basics for this game.

46:49.640 --> 46:51.757
- You talk about more than one thing...
- Dad!

46:58.640 --> 47:00.472
- Dad!
- No!

47:00.560 --> 47:02.950
No, fuck...
Don't fuckin' call anybody.

47:03.040 --> 47:04.599
Yeah, don't call!

47:04.680 --> 47:07.400
Your dad probably hasn't hidden
things as well as he should've.

47:07.480 --> 47:08.755
Please.

47:08.840 --> 47:11.480
He's out of money, isn't he?

47:11.560 --> 47:12.880
Isn't he?

47:14.600 --> 47:15.829
Almost, yes.

47:15.920 --> 47:17.832
When's the next drop?

47:19.240 --> 47:21.880
You think he's just gonna let
those payouts stop? When is it?

47:21.960 --> 47:26.273
This Wednesday, Griffith Park,
by the merry-go-round.

47:26.360 --> 47:28.272
You're gonna move it up to tomorrow.

47:28.360 --> 47:29.919
You hear me?

47:30.000 --> 47:31.832
Do it the same way
you always did it.

47:32.960 --> 47:34.758
I'll be recording it.

47:34.840 --> 47:38.436
And anything,
anything goes wrong,

47:38.520 --> 47:40.159
it goes right to the FBI.

47:40.240 --> 47:41.276
You got it?

47:41.360 --> 47:44.000
Silas won't be there.

47:44.080 --> 47:45.992
It's... It's always Petra.

47:49.320 --> 47:52.438
You teaching him to be
a piece of shit like you?

47:56.080 --> 47:57.958
No. He's a good kid.

48:07.040 --> 48:08.520
You don't get it.

48:08.600 --> 48:10.751
I'm trying to help you, too.

48:36.520 --> 48:38.273
<i>Look at that face.</i>

48:40.040 --> 48:41.520
<i>Hungry, little mutt.</i>

48:42.920 --> 48:44.070
<i>You want.</i>

48:45.760 --> 48:48.992
<i>What else are you
gonna tell me about myself?</i>

48:51.680 --> 48:53.319
<i>You're a liar.</i>

48:55.280 --> 48:56.680
You're a user.

48:59.240 --> 49:01.232
<i>You wanna be powerful.</i>

49:02.800 --> 49:05.110
<i>You wanna be recognized.</i>

49:06.960 --> 49:08.394
<i>You wanna be seen.</i>

49:10.040 --> 49:12.555
<i>But you can't do what you want.</i>

49:13.840 --> 49:15.433
Why?

49:15.520 --> 49:17.352
<i>'Cause someone's gonna see you,</i>

49:17.440 --> 49:20.274
<i>and you're gonna get punished
for doing what you want.</i>

49:23.760 --> 49:25.911
<i>I got good news and bad news.</i>

49:28.880 --> 49:31.349
There's nobody fucking watching.

50:14.160 --> 50:16.376
- Ethan, what...
- Look, she's fine, all right?

50:16.400 --> 50:18.756
She just fractured her wrist.

50:18.840 --> 50:20.040
- The fuck?
- Got into a fight.

50:23.920 --> 50:25.070
You were in a fight?

50:27.000 --> 50:28.832
Don't worry, Mom. I'm okay.

50:28.960 --> 50:29.996
Don't give me that shit.

50:30.080 --> 50:31.958
- Tell me what happened.
- Nothing.

50:32.720 --> 50:35.235
Nothing. We were just
hanging out at this club,

50:35.320 --> 50:38.199
and out of nowhere, this guy
just starts being a dick to Jay.

50:38.280 --> 50:41.079
- Out of nowhere?
- Whatever.

50:41.160 --> 50:43.277
So, Jay gets into it a little
with this guy,

50:43.360 --> 50:47.195
and then his girlfriend comes up
and starts filming it,

50:47.280 --> 50:49.272
threatening all kinds of shit.

50:49.400 --> 50:52.199
I was just trying
to take her phone away.

50:52.280 --> 50:54.192
And then she fuckin'
starts hitting me.

50:54.760 --> 50:56.797
Now I'm here.

50:58.320 --> 51:00.437
You gotta go to the orthopedist
in the morning.

51:00.520 --> 51:01.520
What club?

51:01.600 --> 51:02.920
Hmm?

51:03.000 --> 51:05.515
- What was the club?
- Some place in...

51:05.600 --> 51:07.592
- What's the name of the club?
- I don't know!

51:07.680 --> 51:10.320
- Oh.
- Hey. Hey!

51:13.520 --> 51:15.830
Come on, Ethan. Fake ID.

51:15.920 --> 51:18.196
- You fucking bitch.
- Hey.

51:18.920 --> 51:22.152
Where do you think
this ends up, Shelby? Hmm?

51:28.200 --> 51:31.716
Nobody is fucking accountable!

51:44.600 --> 51:46.080
Fuck.

52:01.480 --> 52:03.836
Hey, partner!

52:05.080 --> 52:09.518
- Fuck, Antonio. Wh...
- A buddy at Hollywood caught the call.

52:09.600 --> 52:11.478
Come on. Why aren't you picking up
your phone?

52:11.560 --> 52:13.870
I needed a minute.

52:13.960 --> 52:16.634
Okay, well I got a special
agent calling me from the FBI,

52:16.720 --> 52:19.952
pushing me on where you're at
and what you're doing.

52:20.040 --> 52:21.110
What's that about?

52:21.240 --> 52:23.800
- Old friend.
- Old friend. Okay.

52:23.880 --> 52:28.159
Taz Furner's all hot saying
that you took a bag of guns from him.

52:30.320 --> 52:31.515
I'm working.

52:33.440 --> 52:34.590
Bell, come on. Deal me in.

52:34.680 --> 52:36.911
I'm looking out for you, man.

52:38.040 --> 52:42.432
This thing I'm on...
This guy I'm looking for, I own it.

52:42.520 --> 52:45.831
All right? It's mine. Just me.

52:49.320 --> 52:51.391
Come on. Okay?

52:51.520 --> 52:52.520
Okay.

52:54.160 --> 52:55.480
Thanks.

52:57.360 --> 52:58.680
I'll see ya.

53:56.040 --> 53:58.111
Back off! Back up!

55:39.160 --> 55:40.992
<i>♪ I'm not the one
who's so far away ♪</i>

55:41.080 --> 55:45.711
<i>♪ When I feel the snake bite
into my veins ♪</i>

55:48.320 --> 55:50.880
Yeah, this one's serious.

55:50.960 --> 55:52.440
How big?

55:53.600 --> 55:57.196
Very, very fucking big.

55:57.280 --> 55:58.634
Is it for sure?

55:58.720 --> 56:00.996
Yeah, it's from my dad's friend.

56:02.440 --> 56:04.238
He knows how this shit works.

56:05.960 --> 56:07.314
It's real.

56:09.240 --> 56:11.072
It's huge money.

56:12.200 --> 56:13.873
What do ya think?

56:18.720 --> 56:20.040
I think we do it.

56:26.600 --> 56:27.680
You know? It's just...

56:27.720 --> 56:29.757
No, I think the key to the,
everything that is,

56:29.840 --> 56:31.256
is you gotta get
to the Antarctica first.

56:31.280 --> 56:32.776
- You get Antarctica...
- How you gonna do that?

56:32.800 --> 56:34.320
Get Antarctica,
you own the South Pole.

56:34.360 --> 56:36.096
- You own the South Pole...
- There isn't gonna be...

56:36.120 --> 56:37.600
...you can control
the fuckin' world.

56:37.680 --> 56:40.673
You control the fuckin' world,
you control everything, you know?

56:40.760 --> 56:42.956
It's really what it...
It's really that simple.

56:43.040 --> 56:44.554
You know?

56:44.640 --> 56:48.190
I'll take care of the cocaine.

57:00.080 --> 57:01.355
What is it?

57:05.520 --> 57:06.715
Not now.

57:34.200 --> 57:36.556
I'm not fucking lollygagging around.

57:41.440 --> 57:42.874
I haven't even
had breakfast yet.

57:43.760 --> 57:46.320
No, I haven't.
I'm, like, doing everything.

57:46.440 --> 57:48.636
Working like I'm his fucking slave.
Like, honestly.

59:39.440 --> 59:40.669
Fuck.

59:49.080 --> 59:50.480
Fuck!

59:56.040 --> 59:57.474

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.511

Everybody
onto the fucking ground!

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.398
Do you think I'm fuckin' joking?

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.233
You think I'm joking? Huh?

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.751
Don't look at me!

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.709
Where the fuck you going?

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:02.555
No, no, no, no!

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.995
- Let's go.
- We don't wait for backup?

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.914
This is a fucking gunfight.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:36.640
Go!

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:46.794
I'm hit!

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:04.716
Shit.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.436
Help me!

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:07.749
She's gone!

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.629
We gotta go!

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:38.319
Move! Move! Move!

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:57.976
Let me see your hands.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Let me see your hands!

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.754

Fuck!

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.153
Get against the fucking wall!

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.240
Take him!

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.675
Fuck you, Erin!

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:10.713
Stop it. Come on! Stop!

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.519
Get off me!

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.910
Get off me!

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.479
No!

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:31.316
Hey, stay in there!

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.834
Lock that door!

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:39.229
Stay inside!

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.960
Keep everyone here!

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.679
Move.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:46.115
I'm a cop.

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.715
- Move!
- Fuck you!

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.074
Oh, my fucking teeth, Erin.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:57.356
Fucked my teeth...

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.159
- Shut up.
- Fucked my teeth...

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:01.994
Listen to me.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.430
Be quiet. All right?

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.240
Very fuckin' quiet. You get it?

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.754
What are you gonna do to me?

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:15.393
- Ow.
- Get in. Shut up.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.432
Oh. LAPD. Off-duty.

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:41.520
You okay?

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.637
I lost her. Yeah, yeah.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:49.717
Dark hair. Caucasian.
Female. Five-six!

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.718
Oh, fuck!

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.416
<i>Hey, Bell, it's Antonio.</i>

01:08:24.439 --> 01:08:25.350
<i>You gotta call me right now.</i>

01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:27.591
<i>What the fuck is going on?</i>

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.600
<i>Detective Bell,</i>

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.596
<i>this is Captain Flores,
Inglewood Police.</i>

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.149
<i>You need to contact me
as soon as possible.</i>

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.816
<i>Bell, this is Lieutenant Dozier.</i>

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:41.560
<i>I need you to report right away
to make your statement downtown.</i>

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:49.760
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:11.559
Silas will call. That's the plan.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:12.640
Good.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:17.630
What if, when I pick up
that phone, I just scream?

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.359
You won't.

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:22.517
This place is disgusting.

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:28.116
It's your choice, being here.

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.475
It's all your choice.

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:33.191
Same fucking thing with you.

01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:37.478
Seventeen years later,
same fucking shit.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:41.076
You can call your daddy
anytime and be outta here.

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:46.191
You can just call up
your daddy anytime. You're rich.

01:09:49.439 --> 01:09:51.477
You don't fucking get it.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.992
He's dead, so...

01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:00.397
Aren't you gonna be in trouble
for doing this to me?

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.551
Won't matter if I bring him in.

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.232
You know he's not gonna
let you take him.

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.232
He doesn't have
to let me do anything.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.834
Oh, yeah, he does.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:15.119
Why don't you just...
leave it alone?

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.919
I left it alone.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.151
He started it again.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.874
People are dead.

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:35.438
He won't even fuck me anymore.

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:38.035
Just shut the fuck up.
You're pathetic.

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:41.272
- It's all these girls.
- Oh, come on.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:46.075
Nineteen, 20. All new.

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.390
More whenever he wants.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:55.235
He just left without me.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.880
I hurt you.

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:04.871
You hurt me pretty bad.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.479
Do you wanna help me out?

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.712
- No.
- No?

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:15.793
- Mm-mmm.
- Come on.

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:17.712
- My gear's in the bedroom.
- No.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.314
Help me out.

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.590
I'm not gonna
give you that shit.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:25.400
Come on, Erin.
Please? Please?

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.596
Come here.

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:30.029
Please, Erin?

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.474
Hmm?

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:34.678
You know, seeing you
makes me think of Chris.

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.074
Just shut up.

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:47.475
Would you?

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:51.195
I'm gonna die
for what happened to him, right?

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.953
I doubt it.

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:56.712
You'll get me a deal, right?

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.280
That's the idea.

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.354
Oh, fuck.

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:09.840
Make it simple.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.632
Answer the fucking phone.

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.439
Make it simple.

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:23.075
Yeah?

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.000
No.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.276
<i>You're my girl, right?</i>

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:38.599
I know.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.516
Okay, I'll wait for it, then.

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.192
I'll see ya.

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:00.156
There'll be a text
saying when and where.

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.955
You think you're fucking better
than me? You aren't shit.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.315
Doesn't matter.

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.357
You wanted to be one of us.

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:14.079
You wanted money,
same as all of us.

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:15.616
You just didn't have
the balls to take it.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.393
You're no fucking better than me.

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.472
You're a cop. Fuck you.

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:27.120
Doing your job,
but you wanted it, same as me.

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:38.034
Can you get the cops
here pretty fast?

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:40.954
- I think I need some help.
- Yeah.

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.599
They'll be here.

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:47.776
<i>It's a lot of money.</i>

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:50.395
<i>I mean, it's a lot.</i>

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.838
<i>Yeah, but how much is a lot?</i>

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.597
<i>Seven million. Maybe ten.</i>

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.119
Fuck.

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.032
Tape's clearer than I thought.

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.593
All that wind.

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:11.270
Jesus Christ.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.153
That kind of money.

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:18.560
I know.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.833
You think they can pull it off?

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:24.520
Maybe.

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.392
Doesn't matter.

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:29.676
We got more than enough to arrest.

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.040
We should call Gil,

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:34.712
get him to work
on pulling us out.

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:43.320
What if we don't?

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.759
You look nice.

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:18.840
Thanks.

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:23.314
What's, uh... What's up?

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:28.677
I need you to take the money.

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:31.150
All right, stop talking now!

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:33.232
- Ethan, can...
- No. We had one promise.

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.232
Yeah, and I kept it.

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:38.154
I put it in storage,
and I never looked at it again.

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:41.756
- I've never fucking touched it.
- Yeah, until now.

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:43.513
We don't even know
how much it is.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:46.439
- I don't wanna know how much.
- It's gotta be at least $300,000.

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.791
Could be half a mill.
I don't know.

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.918
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.720
I want you to use it.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:57.395
- No.
- I want you to take Shelby

01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.437
- and get her outta here.
- What?

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:00.936
This place is gonna fucking kill her.

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:02.360
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:05.114
- Erin...
- I can't fix it.

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:06.839
I don't know what else to do.

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:08.593
So, what, you're just
gonna check out?

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:11.752
You've never liked it here.
You only came here for me.

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.200
That's not even close
to the point.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:14.496
You can leave.
You can both leave.

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:16.477
She's better off with you.

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:19.000
That's bullshit.

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:22.875
You think that's easy
for me to say?

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:29.395
Take her.

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:41.030
Let one good thing come from my shit.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.433
I could've been that thing.

01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.713
I gotta go.

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:28.235
Get the money.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.717
Can I, uh, have
the bathroom key?

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:37.596
Hey.

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:39.273
<i>Hey. Where are you?</i>

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:42.677
I'm on my way. Sorry.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.240
<i>You gotta get back, babe.</i>

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.397
No. What the fuck?

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:21.278
No.

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:23.079
What the fuck?

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.755
Fuck. Fuck.

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.393
Fuck!

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:32.791
No! Fuck.

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:35.952
Fuck! Fuck!

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:51.794
So, what?

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.715
What do you want?

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:54.916
Hmm?

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.558
$11,460.

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.432
Where'd you get that?

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.671
It's yours if you want it.

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.829
If you agree, I send
a general delivery to Spokane.

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:17.200
That's where you're from, right?

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.596
Some fucking mom you are.

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.274
Why that amount?

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.192
It's what I have.

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:34.513
That's pretty sad.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:37.670
It's what I think it costs.

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:41.911
You stay in Spokane.
You never come back.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.391
You never contact her again,
not even a single text.

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:47.876
She loves me, you know?

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:53.354
If you come back here, I'll kill you.

01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:56.640
And it'll be easy,

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:59.149
'cause I don't care
what happens to me.

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.357
I don't wanna live in Spokane.

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:13.040
I don't give a fuck
where you wanna live.

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:16.118
You never contact her again,
not even once.

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.513
Take the money.

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:26.837
I should, just to play you.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:30.876
Don't make excuses
for what you want. It's weak.

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:43.194
Fine.

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:46.630
No one's worth this shit.

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:49.440
Now, you better fucking send it.

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:50.715
Don't worry.

01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:56.039
She is never gonna love you,
you know?

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:58.633
Doesn't have to.

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:04.958
Cunt.

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:51.352
We had no indication
we were blown.

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:53.790
We were sent to meet
a dealer contact they had.

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:55.439
Name him.

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:58.274
- Use a real one. Doesn't matter.
- Okay. Tic Tac.

01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.750
We were sent to meet a dealer
we were familiar with,

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:02.832
whose street name is Tic Tac.

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:03.797
Yes, I do!

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.439
I listen to everything
you fucking say.

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.954
Why do you fucking shout?

01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:08.560
I'm listening to everything
you say...

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:09.790
<i>When he wasn't there,</i>

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:12.839
<i>we called Petra to tell her
we were coming back.</i>

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:14.553
Look. There. I did it.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.696
Great. Perfect. That's excellent.

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:20.359
- You don't fucking listen to me.
- I do listen!

01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:22.750
She didn't answer,
which was not atypical.

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:24.638
<i>We returned to the house.</i>

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.200
<i>No one was there.</i>

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:28.590
We went to two locations
we knew they were looking at.

01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:31.593
And while we were at the first,
they were already hitting the second.

01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:33.239
It was over before we got there.

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:35.960
We take full responsibility
for losing contact, but...

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:38.032
There was no forewarning,

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:41.511
and we believe we did nothing
to cause them to mistrust us.

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:54.392
He's got us driving on the day.
That's good.

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:56.199
Uh, we'll be outside.

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.838
Something goes wrong, then what?

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:17.752
Break cover. Call it in ourselves.

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:20.435
Make arrests when
the responders get there.

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:28.109
Ready? Let's go.

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:33.116
<i>We gotta work out that story too.</i>

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:34.873
We say they took our phones.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.515
We made the first move we could.

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:38.716
Yeah.

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:04.390
We get to the meet-up.
We take our share. They all scatter.

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:15.432
We do the after-action reports,

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:18.552
go through the motions
for a while.

01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:28.990
Wait till it all quiets down,
and then we quit.

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.394
And we're gone.

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:20.836
No dye packs.

01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:22.673
No fucking dye packs in here, right?

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:59.040
Hurry the fuck up, I said!

01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:07.696
Let's go! Let's go! Go, go!

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:08.790
Come on!

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:12.078
Eyes fuckin' down!

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:14.760
- Down on the ground!
- Come on! Come on!

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:52.917
Oh, fuck. Fuck!

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:08.874
No, no...

01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:12.630
No, no...

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:16.396
Why is he going back in?

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:32.350
No fucking dye pack? Huh?

01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:33.317
FBI!

01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:58.920
Oh, God.

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:02.976
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.000
We gotta go.

01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:08.316
What the fuck?

01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:09.635
No.

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:16.040
Just go. Drive.
Just fucking drive!

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:17.679
- Just go!
- No.

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:18.830
- Do it!
- No!

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:20.639
- Fucking do it!
- No!

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:23.474
Go! Come on, come on!

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:44.871
Are you fucking cops, Erin?

01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:49.560
Are you fucking cops?

01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:51.996
Erin, are you a fucking cop?

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:55.096
Just talk to me, Erin.
Talk to me.

01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:56.480
Now tell me,
are you a fuckin' cop?

01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.392
Don't tell me
you're a fuckin' cop.

01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:00.472
Don't tell me you're a fuckin' cop.

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.354
Don't fuckin' do that.

01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:05.839
Don't fuckin' turn this way!

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:08.230
Slow down!

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:10.232
Slow the fuck down!

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:30.919
No! No!

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:40.520
No! No!

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:44.398
No. No.

01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:12.672
Officer needs assistance.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.799
Why am I sitting here?

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.913
'Cause I wanna talk.

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:39.514
So, the worthless school shrink
made me do this thing.

01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:43.669
Like, poking around,

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:46.673
looking for a good memory
from when I was a kid.

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:50.475
I was like,

01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:56.113
"I don't remember... anything.

01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:59.716
Like, nothing
about being a little kid."

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:03.509
And it wasn't even
that fucking long ago, either.

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:11.676
- Well, I don't think I do either, so...
- I know.

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:15.037
You want me to be grateful
that you didn't burn me with cigarettes,

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:16.839
- or just fucking go and leave you...
- No.

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:20.038
...and your brothers alone
for a week with a couple boxes of cereal.

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:25.959
I never told you that.

01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:28.273
Ethan told me that.

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:35.360
I'm gonna go.

01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:41.479
Come on, Shelby, please. Just...

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:44.837
One second, please? Please.

01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:47.389
Just sit down for a second.

01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:51.633
Just stay, hmm?

01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:56.632
I wanna go back.

01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:58.632
I wanna...

01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:03.357
find something...

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:06.918
I don't know, decent.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.878
Just something...

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:22.551
You wanna know the one thing
that I remembered with the shrink?

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:25.115
What?

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:29.279
I mean, I don't know
if it actually happened or not, but, um...

01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:35.198
I was maybe seven,

01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:39.797
and you had come
and got me from school early,

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:44.477
said we were camping,
like a surprise camping trip.

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:49.510
So, we went up in the mountains,
and this huge snowstorm came in.

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.000
We didn't have the right gear.

01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:53.311
And we got lost
trying to go back to our car.

01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:57.273
Did it actually happen?

01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:04.519
- Yeah.
- How long were we lost?

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.835
Overnight.

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:13.640
And you were so messed up.

01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:18.557
Like, I could tell
something was wrong with you

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:20.757
because I was looking
at your shoes.

01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:25.033
They were just sneakers...

01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:29.552
and they were so wet
that they were falling apart.

01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:38.750
It was dark... and cold.

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:42.839
And, you know, I had, um...

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:46.438
I felt like...

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.753
Like, I wasn't scared.

01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:55.634
It's so fucked up, really,

01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:56.995
but, uh...

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:05.515
I felt safe because I was with you.

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.556
I knew that you were strong...

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:15.992
and that you would protect me.

01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:20.232
But, at the same time,

01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:23.073
why were we out there?

01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:30.274
And I kept saying that.
Like, "We shouldn't be here.

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.158
Why did you take us here?"

01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:37.112
We were out there
all alone for no reason.

01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:40.472
Like a couple of animals.

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:43.317
I just kept saying, "Why?"

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.478
But you wouldn't answer me.

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:50.359
You couldn't just answer me.

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:52.875
I would've taken anything,
but you don't speak.

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:55.236
I know what it's like
to grow up mad.

01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:57.277
Well, that's not my fucking fault.

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:00.600
I didn't want that for you.

01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:05.118
I'm mad. I'm still fuckin' mad.
It's burned a circuit in my brain.

01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:07.590
But it's... That's...

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:11.031
It's just an excuse.

01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:13.394
Yeah.

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:21.357
Someone very important,
your dad, was killed.

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:23.432
- Ethan's my dad.
- Yeah, but, I mean...

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:26.678
Ethan's my dad.

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:28.160
Just...

01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:32.953
Would you let him be, then?

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:39.471
It's my fault that he died.

01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:43.395
It's my fault that other people died.

01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:44.914
What?

01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:54.399
I'm not good.

01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:57.473
I'm the one who's bad.

01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:59.074
It's not you.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.514
All right?

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:09.276
I'm sorry for lying to you.

01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:13.796
I lied.

01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:15.360
I stole.

01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:17.680
And worse.

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:32.917
You can be better than me.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.992
What's going on?

01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:12.549
I... do...

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:17.471
love you.

01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:59.033
Silas.

01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:02.594
That voice.

01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:09.072
Petra's not coming, is she?

01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:11.754
No.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.798
Get what I sent you?

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:19.673
You getting your mail here now?

01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:30.231
<i>There's nobody fucking watching.</i>

01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:34.512
But I see who you are.

01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:39.115
You didn't get away.

01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:57.917
Murder weapon.
Smells like it comes from you.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.116
Oh.

01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:03.318
<i>I have a body and a gun
that comes from you.</i>

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.151
Look, Bell...

01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:30.553
Look, this is covered, okay?
Just go... lie down.

01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:36.030
What about
if I know who did this?

01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:40.397
Well, I don't know. Then we can
probably use that, Detective.

01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:43.877
I mean, you gonna solve
this right now, then, or what?

01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:14.919
Where the fuck you been? Hmm?

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.117
Can't keep coming
to work like this.

01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:20.314
You okay?

01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:23.791
I'm fine.
I'm just a little fucked up.

01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:27.760
Just need... need to rest.

01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:29.513
Yeah. Do that.

01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:32.034
Take that.

01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:39.990
What's this?

01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:43.557
You'll figure it out.

01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:47.639
Tell people.

01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:53.792
All right. Yeah.

01:46:57.240 --> 01:46:59.835
Just...

01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:02.833
I just need a minute. Yeah?

01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:05.434
<i>It's a bad idea.</i>

01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:10.032
<i>I'm tired, Chris.</i>

01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:20.078
I've spent my whole
fuckin' life scrapping,

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.955
jealous, hungry, scared.

01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:29.756
I just wanna spend one fuckin' day
on the other side of that.

01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:34.349
I know.

01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:38.519
That's me, too.

01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:44.119
But this isn't the way.

01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:50.599
Please.

01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:57.794
You gotta give me this.
Please?

01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:02.079
I need this.

01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:09.589
You want me to say it?
I'll fucking say it.

01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:12.912
Do it for me.

01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:18.872
For us.

01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:22.835
Hmm?

01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:33.997
- Do you love me?
- You know I do.

01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:37.791
Because if we do this...

01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:43.677
you gotta promise me
you're not going anywhere.

01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:45.877
It's you and me, you understand?

01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:48.919
'Cause that's the only reason.

01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:51.674
Fuck, yeah. I'm in.

01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:01.120
Listen to me.

01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:05.752
Anything goes wrong, anything,

01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:08.594
someone gets their hair mussed,
we pull the pin.

01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:11.070
- Mm-hmm.
- We identify. Shut it down, okay?

01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:13.356
- Yeah. Yes.
- And we accept the consequences.

01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:16.151
Nobody gets a fuckin' scratch.

01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:24.032
It's good.
The plan is good.

01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:33.312
I'm doing this for you.

01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:37.520
Only you.

01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:40.560
I know.

01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:43.480
I love you.

01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:46.154
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:54.399
I gotta get back.

01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:14.233
Nice ass.

01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:18.679
It's all yours.
