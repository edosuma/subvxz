<i>"Last Man Standing"</i>

00:04.271 --> 00:05.771
<i>In front of a live</i>
<i>studio audience.</i>

00:05.773 --> 00:08.874
Boy, mother nature sure took
a dump on us last night.

00:08.876 --> 00:12.344
Yeah, I love the first snow
of the season.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.612
Mike:
Right on schedule.

00:13.614 --> 00:17.483
It's like nature's giving
al gore the finger.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.985
Morning.

00:19.987 --> 00:21.353
Hey, where are you going
in such a hurry?

00:21.355 --> 00:22.454
To get my snow shovel.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.156
The sky dropped
a ton of white gold,

00:24.158 --> 00:26.558
And I'm here to scoop it up
at 20 bucks a driveway.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.293
I thought
you charged $15?

00:28.295 --> 00:29.528
Oh, inflation.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.930
We're living
in obama's America.

00:34.701 --> 00:38.003
I know we're not supposed to
pick favorites with the kids,

00:38.005 --> 00:39.705
But it's not even close.

00:41.841 --> 00:44.009
And here comes
number three.

00:44.011 --> 00:46.712
[ sighs ]

00:46.714 --> 00:49.148
All this snow's gonna make
my morning commute a nightmare,

00:49.150 --> 00:51.083
So I think I'm just gonna
skip today.

00:51.085 --> 00:52.651
That's a good idea.

00:52.653 --> 00:55.187
Just give me a check
for a $106.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.156
I'm sorry -- what?

00:57.158 --> 00:59.224
I did a cost analysis
of sending you to school.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.093
It costs me $106 a day.

01:01.095 --> 01:04.997
You don't go, send me that $106
or go get dressed.

01:04.999 --> 01:07.332
I'm really glad you didn't do
this while I was in high school

01:07.334 --> 01:09.034
'cause that would've cost me
a fortune.

01:09.036 --> 01:10.402
Hey,
what are you doing back?

01:10.404 --> 01:11.737
Hey, that was quick.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.673
I told you to pee
before you put that snowsuit on.

01:14.675 --> 01:17.543
No, all the neighbors I usually
hit were already dug out.

01:17.545 --> 01:18.710
Ah.

01:18.712 --> 01:21.213
Well, must be another
eager beaver on the block.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.282
Early bird
gets the worm, right?

01:23.284 --> 01:28.454
It must be an early
eager beaver bird.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.189
Honey, if you don't
have anything

01:30.191 --> 01:31.190
To add to the conversation,

01:31.192 --> 01:33.092
Don't feel you got to
just jump in.

01:34.127 --> 01:36.095
I guess I'm just gonna have to
get up that much earlier

01:36.097 --> 01:37.129
The next time it snows.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.031
Oh, you know,
that is the spirit.

01:39.033 --> 01:42.034
You be an even earlier-er
eager...

01:42.036 --> 01:43.702
Beaver...

01:43.704 --> 01:45.504
Er bird.

01:47.974 --> 01:49.441
Y-you don't have to
stick around for this.

01:51.478 --> 01:54.546
-- Captions by vitac --

01:58.284 --> 02:00.786
Here you go.
Happy eight-month anniversary.

02:00.788 --> 02:04.356
[ chuckles ]
oh, my god!

02:05.558 --> 02:07.226
You're amazing.
Aww.

02:07.228 --> 02:11.430
Hey, Kyle, um, do you ever
think about the future?

02:11.432 --> 02:14.566
Yeah, sure,
all the time.

02:14.568 --> 02:17.236
I think we'll have cars
that hover, not fly.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.271
And we'll make contact
with aliens

02:19.273 --> 02:21.140
And finally discover
which is more accurate,

02:21.142 --> 02:23.342
"star wars"
or "star trek."

02:23.344 --> 02:26.912
Yeah, no, I meant more like
with us, like you and me.

02:26.914 --> 02:27.913
Oh. [ laughs ]

02:27.915 --> 02:29.081
Of course.
I'm sorry.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.415
That's okay.

02:30.417 --> 02:32.351
We'll be dead by then.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.287
Shoot,
I'd better get to work.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.287
Okay. Mwah!

02:36.289 --> 02:37.623
Where's that hover car now?
Am I right?

02:37.625 --> 02:38.624
Happy eight.

02:38.626 --> 02:40.092
Okay.

02:41.594 --> 02:43.195
Cheers to you, too, sir.
[ chuckles ]

02:44.631 --> 02:46.632
Table five
is not gonna tip you.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.467
Oh, yeah,
most of them don't.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.369
This job
is kind of a dead end.

02:50.371 --> 02:53.805
You want to know why
you don't get more tips?

02:53.807 --> 02:55.641
Um, my dad likes
to blame obama.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.309
I think
that could work here.

02:57.311 --> 03:00.879
It's that boyfriend of yours
always hanging around.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.881
When these men come in here,

03:02.883 --> 03:05.117
We need to put on
a little show.

03:05.119 --> 03:07.286
Oh.
We're not waitresses.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.687
We're a fantasy.

03:10.790 --> 03:14.560
Guys want to think
we're available to them.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.361
Well, I mean, I don't
want them thinking that.
I have a boyfriend.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.130
Well,
I have a boyfriend, too,

03:18.132 --> 03:20.299
But I keep that on the d.L.
With my customers...

03:20.301 --> 03:24.169
And my husband.

03:24.171 --> 03:26.138
Okay.
I'll give it a try.

03:26.140 --> 03:27.973
Okay.
[ clears throat ]

03:27.975 --> 03:31.577
So, what looks good to you
besides me?

03:35.315 --> 03:37.416
Hey, Vanessa, get this.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.584
Huh?

03:38.586 --> 03:40.319
I'm putting on
a new pair of socks just now,

03:40.321 --> 03:41.920
And my toe came right through
the end of the sock.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.222
Can you believe it?

03:43.224 --> 03:46.391
Yeah, I can't believe
we're talking about it.

03:47.427 --> 03:48.427
Ooh!

03:48.429 --> 03:50.829
Eight driveways,
20 bucks apiece.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.198
That other kid snoozed and lost.
Cha-ching!

03:53.200 --> 03:55.867
Nicely done, evie.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.236
The free market at work.

03:57.238 --> 03:58.170
Look at my daughter

03:58.172 --> 04:00.672
Dipping her toe
into the business world.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.307
So now toes
are interesting.

04:03.209 --> 04:05.344
[ door rattles ]

04:05.346 --> 04:06.345
Oh, hon, you know,

04:06.347 --> 04:08.247
It's phil munroe
from down the street.

04:08.249 --> 04:09.414
I wonder what he wants.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.516
Guess we'll never know.

04:11.518 --> 04:13.252
Come on. Be nice!

04:13.254 --> 04:15.754
Why don't you ask him
if he's having a garage sale?

04:15.756 --> 04:18.390
Maybe I can buy back
all the stuff I loaned him.

04:18.392 --> 04:19.558
Hey, phil.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.260
Hey, Vanessa.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.362
I just came by
to return Mike's rake.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.364
You borrowed my leaf blower,
phil!

04:25.366 --> 04:27.766
Whose rake is this?

04:27.768 --> 04:30.369
I got to learn to put names
on these things.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.137
It is my rake.
Hmm.

04:33.373 --> 04:35.207
Come on in. Hey.
Thanks.

04:35.209 --> 04:37.109
I also came by
to talk to your daughter --

04:37.111 --> 04:38.243
The one
with the snow shovel.

04:38.245 --> 04:39.544
Oh, Eve. Yeah, evie.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.280
Oh. Hi, mr. Munroe.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.315
Hey, Eve.
My gosh, you're all grown up.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.483
Seems like yesterday

04:44.485 --> 04:46.785
I was buying
your girl scout cookies --

04:46.787 --> 04:48.320
Everything but thin mints.

04:48.322 --> 04:49.454
Ah.

04:49.456 --> 04:52.324
Let's not pin that
all on Eve.

04:52.326 --> 04:55.327
I wanted to talk to you about
your snow-shovel business.

04:55.329 --> 05:00.232
Oh, so you want to hire
Eve's snow no mo'?

05:00.234 --> 05:03.135
Oh, please step into my office.
Take a seat.

05:03.137 --> 05:04.636
I'll beat any competitor.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.772
I hate to hear that
because...

05:06.774 --> 05:08.440
I'm your competitor.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.575
Phil, you're shoveling
driveways?

05:10.577 --> 05:12.644
Couldn't get a paper route?

05:12.646 --> 05:15.147
I'm always looking
to earn a little extra money,

05:15.149 --> 05:16.848
So after the storm
the other day,

05:16.850 --> 05:18.917
I decided to bust out
the old snowblower

05:18.919 --> 05:20.185
And knock on some doors.

05:20.187 --> 05:21.453
Everything okay?

05:21.455 --> 05:22.453
Oh, peachy. Yeah.

05:22.455 --> 05:25.457
It'd just be better if Eve
would let me do the driveways

05:25.459 --> 05:26.692
In our neighborhood.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.927
What, uh,
what do you think, Eve?

05:28.929 --> 05:31.830
Well, I can't really say
with him sitting there,

05:31.832 --> 05:33.632
But, uh...

05:33.634 --> 05:35.867
I was kind of counting on that
for christmas money.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.269
Well, your parents
are doing fine.

05:37.271 --> 05:39.338
I'm sure they can give you
a little extra allowance

05:39.340 --> 05:42.007
To buy your cds
and pogo sticks.

05:42.009 --> 05:45.444
I don't get an allowance.
I've always had real jobs.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.012
Eve, giving up these jobs
for phil

05:47.014 --> 05:49.114
Would be a really nice thing
to do.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.349
Thanks, Mike.

05:50.351 --> 05:53.785
But is the nice thing to do
the right thing to do?

05:54.821 --> 05:57.289
Yes. Yes,
according to most people.

05:57.291 --> 05:59.658
Mike: Mm-hmm.
And jesus.

05:59.660 --> 06:03.528
My point is, why does anyone
have to step aside?

06:03.530 --> 06:05.464
There's plenty of driveways,
plenty of snow.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.998
Why don't we let
the free market decide?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.134
Free market? Ha!

06:09.136 --> 06:11.336
I love her,
but she's a real task master.

06:11.338 --> 06:13.805
She's got me working weekends
at quiznos.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.475
No shame in that.
They make a heck of a sandwich.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.475
Mike, really?

06:17.477 --> 06:19.311
I mean, is this the time
to be teaching Eve

06:19.313 --> 06:21.179
The finer points
of economics?

06:21.181 --> 06:22.581
She's been working
these driveways

06:22.583 --> 06:24.149
In this neighborhood
for years.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.151
Yeah, I've built up
a real business.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.420
I think it's a lot to ask to
have her walk away from this.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.589
No, it really isn't.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.493
But if that's how you want
to play it,

06:34.495 --> 06:36.995
I'm just glad I'm the one
with the snowblower.

06:36.997 --> 06:40.265
Yeah? Who'd you borrow
that from, phil?

06:40.267 --> 06:42.401
Thanks, dad.
Yeah.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.069
Oh, I don't like this.
Mike: Yeah.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.071
I feel like he's not telling us
the whole story.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.140
Yeah, he's had more
than one box of thin mints.

06:49.842 --> 06:51.910
Oh, I think Eve
should step aside.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.746
Phil obviously needs the money
more than she does.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.082
What?
Where do you get that idea?

06:57.084 --> 06:59.084
"from each
according to his ability

06:59.086 --> 07:00.919
To each
according to his need."

07:00.921 --> 07:02.354
You know who said that?

07:02.356 --> 07:03.354
You know what?

07:03.356 --> 07:05.524
For the third time today,
I'm not Karl Marx.

07:07.293 --> 07:10.862
And I'm sorry I asked you
to share your waffles.

07:10.864 --> 07:13.365
Hey. What are you guys
talking about?

07:13.367 --> 07:14.533
Marxism.

07:14.535 --> 07:17.436
Ah, took dad's waffles again,
didn't you?

07:17.438 --> 07:20.539
No, mr. Munroe is struggling
to make ends meet.

07:20.541 --> 07:23.775
I think he wants to compete
with Eve to shovel driveways.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.310
We don't know
that he's struggling.

07:25.312 --> 07:26.545
He could be saving up
for a boat.

07:26.547 --> 07:27.779
We won't know about that

07:27.781 --> 07:29.314
Until he borrows my truck
to tow it around.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.982
And let me guess.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.885
You want Eve
to destroy him.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.954
Eve has worked really hard
for all this.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.557
There's no reason why she should
give it all up for him.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.225
I mean, why is he more entitled
than she is?

07:40.227 --> 07:41.293
He's not.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.528
Actually agree with dad
on this one.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.199
Okay.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.736
Not much fun in that,
though.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.605
No, no, no,
the "he needs it more" theory

07:53.607 --> 07:55.507
Is what's justified
pay discrepancies

07:55.509 --> 07:57.442
Between men and women
for centuries, okay?

07:57.444 --> 07:59.845
The assumption that men
are the breadwinners

07:59.847 --> 08:01.847
And deserve
to make more money.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.182
I'm a feminist!

08:04.184 --> 08:06.985
I feel bad for phil.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.588
I mean, the poor guy's working
weekends in a sandwich shop.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.456
Oh, sweet.
Those jobs are hard to get.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.325
They only pick, like,
the best of the best.

08:13.327 --> 08:14.593
If they're such geniuses,

08:14.595 --> 08:15.961
Why do they always give me
pepper jack

08:15.963 --> 08:17.429
When I ask for swiss?

08:17.431 --> 08:20.298
All of those fast-food jobs
that teenagers used to get

08:20.300 --> 08:22.968
Are getting gobbled up
by these gross old people.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.437
I want fries with that,
not sadness, okay?

08:26.806 --> 08:28.440
Bagging groceries,
babysitting --

08:28.442 --> 08:30.509
Adults are taking all
of the great kid jobs.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.611
How are teenagers
supposed to buy beer, huh?

08:32.613 --> 08:35.280
Or in your case
as a teenager,

08:35.282 --> 08:37.649
It was baby wipes
and formula.

08:37.651 --> 08:40.519
Why do I ever
come over here?

08:40.521 --> 08:42.153
Okay, dad...

08:42.155 --> 08:43.321
I'm having second thoughts

08:43.323 --> 08:44.456
About this whole competition
with mr. Munroe.

08:44.458 --> 08:47.158
Ah, I am so glad, Eve.
You know what?

08:47.160 --> 08:50.228
There's more to life
than the almighty dollar.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.531
Well, every rap song ever made
disagrees with that.

08:52.533 --> 08:55.200
I don't think I can go
head-to-head

08:55.202 --> 08:56.568
With munroe's snowblower,
dad.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.503
I think I'm just ready to rent
yours for a buck a driveway.

08:58.505 --> 08:59.971
No, no, no.
It's 2 bucks.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.574
W-w-wait, you're charging her
to use the snowblower?

09:02.576 --> 09:04.843
Just want a little taste.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.545
A little taste?

09:06.547 --> 09:09.147
Want to wet my beak.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.982
W-what are you --
a mobster?

09:10.984 --> 09:13.051
Don't ask me about my business,
Vanessa.

09:20.092 --> 09:22.160
Whew!

09:23.930 --> 09:25.764
Oh, good morning,
mr. Larabee.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.499
Oh, hey, Eve.

09:27.501 --> 09:29.734
The usual --
driveway, walkways, too?

09:29.736 --> 09:31.102
And since you're
a preferred customer,

09:31.104 --> 09:32.904
What song would you like me
to sing while I work?

09:32.906 --> 09:34.272
Oh.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.507
Depends.

09:35.509 --> 09:37.909
How deep into the katy perry
catalog do you go?

09:37.911 --> 09:38.777
Deep.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.246
Hey, Eve, chuck.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.349
Listen, before you commit
to something you'll regret,

09:44.351 --> 09:46.851
You'll, uh, want to hear
about my special --

09:46.853 --> 09:49.220
20% off
whatever she's charging

09:49.222 --> 09:52.524
And a free mug of hot cocoa,
leaded or unleaded.

09:52.526 --> 09:54.526
Hey, back off, munroe.

09:54.528 --> 09:56.027
Mr. Larabee's
one of my regulars.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.629
Oh, I-I don't know, Eve.

09:57.631 --> 10:00.966
He is offering a 20% discount,
and I-I do love hot cocoa.

10:00.968 --> 10:04.035
Although it's a little
too early for the leaded.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.770
Not too early
for helen potts,

10:05.772 --> 10:07.973
But you didn't hear that
from me.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.108
All right, we're burning
daylight, ladies.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.710
Let's just cut to the chase.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.378
I'll do it for half
of my original quote.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.379
Mm.
I mean, come on.

10:14.381 --> 10:17.482
Oh, well, uh,
I-I can't beat that.

10:17.484 --> 10:20.652
I need to earn enough today
to buy my cholesterol meds.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.787
I get them online
from guatemala.

10:23.889 --> 10:26.558
You never really know
what you're taking,

10:26.560 --> 10:29.294
But sometimes you just
have to roll the dice.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.163
I'm sorry, Eve.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.399
As a fellow
high-cholesterol sufferer,

10:34.401 --> 10:36.401
I'm gonna have to go
with munroe.

10:36.403 --> 10:39.004
Mr. Larabee, he is totally
playing you right now.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.472
Uh, no.

10:40.474 --> 10:43.108
I bet his arteries look like
the I-25 at rush hour.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.744
This isn't over, munroe.

10:45.746 --> 10:46.978
Oh, yeah, mr. Larabee,

10:46.980 --> 10:49.614
If he has the big one
in your driveway,

10:49.616 --> 10:52.317
I'm charging double
to shovel his body out!

10:55.154 --> 10:57.088
Phil?
Do you remember?

10:57.090 --> 10:58.690
The guy that's competing
with Eve

10:58.692 --> 10:59.991
For the snow-shoveling
business.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.027
Of course I remember.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.428
I'm not 100.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.964
He won a sandwich
at a quiz show.

11:05.966 --> 11:10.802
He makes sandwiches
at quiznos.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.837
Vanessa found out
that he lost his job

11:12.839 --> 11:13.838
At his accounting firm,

11:13.840 --> 11:15.640
And it wasn't
because of him.

11:15.642 --> 11:17.475
It was just
'cause they downsized.

11:17.477 --> 11:18.677
All righty, gentlemen,

11:18.679 --> 11:19.844
Is there anything else
I can get for you today?

11:19.846 --> 11:21.112
No.
You know what?

11:21.114 --> 11:22.947
This is all yours.
Thank you.

11:22.949 --> 11:23.882
Aww, thank you.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.717
Bye.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.888
Nicely done.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.023
[ chuckles ]

11:32.025 --> 11:33.892
Keep playing your cards
like that,

11:33.894 --> 11:35.694
And that guy
will buy you a car.

11:35.696 --> 11:38.763
Ah, he already did.
[ laughs ]

11:40.366 --> 11:44.869
And the student
becomes the master.

11:44.871 --> 11:48.540
Here you go, sweetie --
a short stack for the big man,

11:48.542 --> 11:49.674
With extra whipped cream

11:49.676 --> 11:51.242
Because you're
my sweetest customer.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.411
Oh, I bet you say that
to all your customers.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.546
I do.

11:56.982 --> 11:57.916
Hey, Mandy cakes!

11:57.918 --> 12:00.051
Whoa!
Oh, oh, whoa!

12:00.053 --> 12:00.985
Hi, first cousin --

12:00.987 --> 12:03.154
The kind that can't be
your boyfriend.

12:04.323 --> 12:06.057
It's so good to see you.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.325
Oh, okay, all right.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.526
Yeah, role-play.

12:08.528 --> 12:09.994
I've heard about this.

12:09.996 --> 12:11.396
So, we're cousins.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.932
The taboo makes it
more exciting.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.034
Listen, I got to ask you to stop
coming by the diner, though.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.536
It's a thing
with the customers.

12:18.538 --> 12:19.571
I just need them to think

12:19.573 --> 12:20.939
That I'm completely available
to them.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.507
Available?

12:22.509 --> 12:24.409
It's just flirting,
but, um,

12:24.411 --> 12:27.245
Just, I get better tips
when I turn on the charm.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.647
Excuse me --
in a minute!

12:31.584 --> 12:32.784
Wait a minute.

12:32.786 --> 12:33.952
So you don't want me around

12:33.954 --> 12:36.187
So that your customers
will think they can date you?

12:36.189 --> 12:37.589
But don't worry --
it's completely phony.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.390
Everybody does it.
I don't.

12:39.392 --> 12:40.525
Well, of course you do.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.360
At outdoor man,
you pretend like you like

12:42.362 --> 12:44.229
All those boring fishing poles
and tents.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.598
I love all those fishing poles
and tents.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.567
I could never stack boxes
of things that I found boring.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.136
Right,
or like with my dad.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.605
You know, you pretend like
you admire and respect him.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.640
I worship your dad.
He's a genius.

12:55.642 --> 12:58.576
Um, Kyle,
you work for salary,

12:58.578 --> 13:01.780
And I work for tips,
so I have to flirt.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.148
Then maybe
I could just pretend

13:03.150 --> 13:04.449
Not to be your boyfriend,
you know?

13:04.451 --> 13:07.886
I-I could come and just sit
in doris' section.

13:10.156 --> 13:12.457
Although
the last time I did,

13:12.459 --> 13:15.960
She put my napkin in my lap
for me, which was nice.

13:15.962 --> 13:18.396
But she lingered.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.799
Oh, Kyle,
it's really just better for me

13:20.801 --> 13:22.600
If you don't come here
at all.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.736
Okay.

13:24.738 --> 13:26.671
Fine. I'll go.

13:26.673 --> 13:30.041
Good luck trying to get that
cousin thing going again later.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.312
I feel bad for phil.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.514
Maybe we could find a place
in accounting here.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.651
No, we've got too many
accountants already.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.587
We've got dale and gary
and chesty mona.

13:44.023 --> 13:48.159
We can't fire chesty mona
because that's bad for morale.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.595
You've got to stop calling her
"chesty mona."

13:50.597 --> 13:53.965
Otherwise, it's gonna come up
in a wrongful-termination suit.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.134
Come on.
That's completely innocent.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.503
I just don't want to confuse her
with black mona.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.171
All right,
with about gary?

14:00.173 --> 14:02.507
We were gonna fire him
'cause he drinks too much.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.809
No, no, no, you -- you can't.
He's in rehab.

14:04.811 --> 14:08.279
Now he's an official alcoholic.
We can't touch him.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.849
But -- but h-he never
shows up to work.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.817
Yeah, I-I think
he's drinking again.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.052
Well,
then let's fire him.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.954
Can't --
alcoholism is a disease

14:15.956 --> 14:18.423
Protected under the americans
with disabilities act.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.960
Maybe if we could prove
gary's a lousy accountant.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.862
He <i>is</i> a lousy accountant!

14:23.864 --> 14:26.397
That's because of
the drinking.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.900
Is there anybody
we <i>can</i> fire?

14:28.902 --> 14:30.168
Well, we could fire dale.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.636
He doesn't have anything
on me.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.471
He's also the best accountant
we have.

14:33.473 --> 14:36.341
So we fire the good people
to protect the bad people.

14:36.343 --> 14:39.244
Isn't that written on
government buildings somewhere?

14:39.246 --> 14:40.511
I'm sorry
about your neighbor.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.180
He's out of luck, which means
Eve's out of luck.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.182
She's just gonna have to
beat him fair and square.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.149
I'm not trying to help Eve.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.051
I'm trying to take care
of my neighbor.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.653
You want to take care
of your neighbor?

14:48.655 --> 14:50.722
Yeah.
Well, get him on the sauce.

15:00.532 --> 15:02.433
Hey.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.502
Mandy,
what are you doing here?

15:04.504 --> 15:05.937
Just wanted to see
my boyfriend.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.538
Well, are you sure
that's a good idea?

15:07.540 --> 15:08.873
I'm at work.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.875
I need for my customers to
believe I'm available to them.

15:10.877 --> 15:14.379
That is
a great purchase, sir.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.514
You should be wearing
the opposite of camouflage.

15:16.516 --> 15:17.815
Everybody should be able
to see you.

15:20.219 --> 15:21.853
Kyle,
what are you doing?

15:21.855 --> 15:23.354
Just being a big phony.

15:23.356 --> 15:24.689
Who am I kidding?

15:24.691 --> 15:26.891
That was
a very handsome man.

15:26.893 --> 15:27.959
Okay.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.894
All right, I get it.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.796
You don't like that I'm flirting
with my customers.

15:31.798 --> 15:32.897
No, I don't.

15:32.899 --> 15:34.732
I don't understand.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.901
You've never been jealous
before.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.937
Something
feels different now.

15:38.939 --> 15:41.873
Before when you asked
about the future,

15:41.875 --> 15:43.541
I started thinking
about <i>our</i> future.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.109
I know that's not
what you meant.

15:47.146 --> 15:49.647
That's actually exactly
what I meant, yeah.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.583
Wow, we really should've
cleared that up then.

15:52.585 --> 15:56.654
The point is, I made an extra
$40 at the diner today.

15:56.656 --> 15:59.223
And I hated
every minute of it.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.558
Because of me?

16:00.560 --> 16:02.760
Yes.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.862
As long as you're miserable,
I guess I'm happy.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.635
I want to say something,

16:10.637 --> 16:13.638
But I-I don't want you
to feel any pressure.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.806
Oh, I-I can take pressure.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.709
My brothers used to sit on me,
like, all the time.

16:20.946 --> 16:22.747
I love you.

16:22.749 --> 16:26.150
Boy, I'm glad you're not
a customer.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.987
Why?

16:28.989 --> 16:32.457
So you know I'm not being
a big phony when I say...

16:32.459 --> 16:33.825
I love you, too.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.065
Wait, you say, "I love you"
to your customers?

16:42.868 --> 16:44.936
Some people need to hear it,
Mandy.

16:44.938 --> 16:47.038
[ chuckles ]

16:48.807 --> 16:50.975
Yeah! Eat it, munroe!

16:50.977 --> 16:53.644
Dad, I got five driveways,
and he only got four.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.780
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
Huh?

16:55.782 --> 16:56.948
Where's mine?

16:56.950 --> 16:58.216
[ sighs ]

16:58.218 --> 16:59.817
There's your taste.

16:59.819 --> 17:02.153
Nutritious and delicious!

17:02.155 --> 17:04.322
[ doorbell rings ]

17:04.324 --> 17:06.991
Hey, larabee.

17:06.993 --> 17:08.493
Hey, Baxter.
Come on in.

17:08.495 --> 17:11.562
No, I've got someplace else
I'd like to be.

17:11.564 --> 17:14.565
And I wish you were there.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.235
Listen, I heard you went
with munroe.

17:17.237 --> 17:23.007
What -- don't you like Eve's
snow no mo' no mo'?

17:23.009 --> 17:24.842
No.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.477
Uh, check out this flyer.

17:27.679 --> 17:30.681
Eve posted those on trees
up and down the street.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.051
"missing cat, tigger,
was last seen

17:33.053 --> 17:35.520
"in a driveway
phil munroe was...

17:35.522 --> 17:39.190
Clearing
with his snowblower."

17:39.192 --> 17:40.992
I thought you might
want to know

17:40.994 --> 17:42.860
The way your daughter
is playing this.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.929
Thanks.
Dead cats.

17:44.931 --> 17:47.899
Not cool.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.837
Hey, Eve.

17:52.839 --> 17:55.173
All right, fine, fine, fine.
I did six driveways.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.908
Here's your $2,
mr. Scrooge.

17:56.910 --> 17:57.942
What's this about?

17:57.944 --> 17:58.943
Oh, awesome, right?

17:58.945 --> 18:00.211
That'll teach munroe
not to undersell me.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.345
Take them down.
Huh?

18:01.347 --> 18:02.513
Take them down.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.015
Well, what happened
to the free market,

18:04.017 --> 18:05.616
Destroying the competition,
putting munroe out
on the street?

18:05.618 --> 18:06.717
I never said any of that.

18:06.719 --> 18:09.620
I set loftier goals
for myself.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.055
The free market
is the greatest thing

18:11.057 --> 18:12.590
That ever happened
to this planet,

18:12.592 --> 18:14.692
But it only works if there's
some moral compass to it.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.127
You start lying and cheating
about it,

18:16.129 --> 18:17.462
It defeats
the whole purpose.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.130
Go take them down
right now.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.731
Great, perfect.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.066
Just when you get an edge,

18:22.068 --> 18:25.903
The man hits you
with regulations!

18:25.905 --> 18:27.271
Boy, I love that kid.

18:29.074 --> 18:31.075
[ doorbell rings ]

18:31.077 --> 18:32.810
Larabee.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.479
I was just --
oh, hey, phil.

18:34.481 --> 18:35.947
Oh, listen,
I just talked to my daughter.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.748
That was a terrible thing.
She's gonna take them all down.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.150
I apologize, okay?
Oh, good.

18:39.152 --> 18:41.319
I'm up for a part-time job
at a pet store,

18:41.321 --> 18:43.488
And I-I don't need
this kind of publicity.

18:43.490 --> 18:44.789
Hey, phil,
hold on a second.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.224
Step in here for a minute.
I got to ask you a question.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.926
Listen, um...

18:48.928 --> 18:51.429
I understand, uh,

18:51.431 --> 18:53.097
That your company went through
a little downsizing.

18:53.099 --> 18:55.299
Oh, you found out about that,
huh?

18:55.301 --> 18:57.135
You're an honorable guy
and a hard worker,

18:57.137 --> 18:59.137
And, listen,
I think I may have an opening

18:59.139 --> 19:01.072
In the accounting department
at outdoor man.

19:01.074 --> 19:02.340
Wow, really?

19:02.342 --> 19:04.142
Yeah, I have to
get rid of a drunk

19:04.144 --> 19:05.810
Who never shows up
and I don't like,

19:05.812 --> 19:07.612
But I'm willing to make
that sacrifice.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.947
Oh, man.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.983
Thank you so much,
Baxter!

19:11.985 --> 19:14.452
What I need you to do
is come by tomorrow morning,

19:14.454 --> 19:16.521
Talk to h.R., right,
bring your résumé,

19:16.523 --> 19:18.689
Driver's license,
and my orbital sander.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.458
[ chuckles ]

19:20.460 --> 19:21.526
You got it.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.593
You know what?

19:22.595 --> 19:23.661
And after that,
we can go have a beer.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.096
Oh, I-I don't drink.

19:25.098 --> 19:27.431
Well, start.
It's job security.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.040
[ sighs ]

19:36.042 --> 19:37.141
Oh, man!

19:37.143 --> 19:38.676
Look at that bankroll.
Vanessa: Hey.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.145
Yeah, since I knocked off
the competition,

19:41.147 --> 19:42.780
I jacked up
my prices again.

19:42.782 --> 19:43.981
Where's my taste?

19:43.983 --> 19:44.982
Sorry, old man.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.851
Now that munroe
has a real job,

19:46.853 --> 19:48.953
He offered to lease me
his snowblower

19:48.955 --> 19:50.054
For a buck a driveway.

19:52.891 --> 19:54.625
So you're squeezing me out?

19:54.627 --> 19:57.461
Free market --
you got to love it.

20:00.499 --> 20:04.001
So, your daughter
cut you out.

20:04.003 --> 20:07.038
How does that
make you feel?

20:07.040 --> 20:09.106
I love that girl.

20:20.152 --> 20:21.886
W-whoa!

20:21.888 --> 20:23.688
[ chuckles ]

20:23.690 --> 20:26.324
Mike Baxter here
for outdoor man.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.726
I'm on top of the mountain,
folks.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.028
You know who gets to be
on top of the mountain?

20:31.030 --> 20:32.930
People who can actually climb
mountains.

20:32.932 --> 20:35.366
It's called meritocracy,

20:35.368 --> 20:38.936
And it should be the basis
for advancement in society.

20:38.938 --> 20:43.608
Meritocracy pushes people
to achieve big things,

20:43.610 --> 20:45.543
Like scaling...

20:45.545 --> 20:47.111
Mount everest.

20:47.113 --> 20:51.182
But our federal government
likes stuff to be more fair.

20:51.184 --> 20:54.785
You know, like that
really exciting soccer game

20:54.787 --> 20:56.954
That they don't allow
your kids to win or lose.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.023
They don't want people
feeling like losers,

20:59.025 --> 21:01.292
So, no, everybody just goes home
going [yawns]

21:01.294 --> 21:03.761
"what'd we just do?"

21:03.763 --> 21:05.563
The fact is,
whether it's mountain climbing

21:05.565 --> 21:06.797
Or climbing
the corporate ladder,

21:06.799 --> 21:10.201
The big prize should go to
the person who merits it most.

21:10.203 --> 21:11.435
It's a simple idea.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.904
But it's made
American free enterprise

21:13.906 --> 21:15.840
[echoing] the envy of the world!

21:19.578 --> 21:22.446
That would normally be
a big problem.

21:22.448 --> 21:26.817
We have satellite phones on sale
at outdoor man this week.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.020
[ chuckles ] help.
