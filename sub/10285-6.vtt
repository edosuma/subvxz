WEBVTT

00:06.939 --> 00:09.043
Previously on ER:

00:09.077 --> 00:10.578
This disease
is invariably fatal.

00:10.611 --> 00:11.512
Derrek Lee.

00:11.545 --> 00:12.613
This is for you,
buddy.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.415
The whole team
signed it.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.516
Written boards
are in a week.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.085
Failure is
not an option.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.719
If we quiz each other
every day, we'll nail it.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.388
Yeah. How soon can you fly home?

00:20.421 --> 00:21.755
It's, it's going to be
at least another week.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.124
Another week?!
(Joe crying)

00:23.157 --> 00:24.358
You're right. I'm 19.

00:24.392 --> 00:25.693
RASGOTRA:
19?
No way.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.228
I started college
when I was 12.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.762
If you've decided
you're not an alcoholic,

00:28.796 --> 00:30.831
I can't help you.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.100
If you are,

00:32.133 --> 00:33.334
I'll be your sponsor
again.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.568
Let me know
what you decide.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074

00:49.250 --> 00:50.651
(clattering)

00:50.684 --> 00:51.485
Abby...

00:51.519 --> 00:52.653
Just a second.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.489
(mumbling):
Crap...

00:55.523 --> 00:57.491
Crap.

00:57.525 --> 01:00.794
Med staff office says
you can't work tonight.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.430
Right. See ya.

01:02.463 --> 01:03.797
I'm serious.
You're banned

01:03.831 --> 01:05.199
until you deal
with your incomplete charts.

01:05.233 --> 01:06.600
Excuse me, Frank.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.402
I told them I was gonna
sling you over my shoulder

01:08.436 --> 01:10.171
and carry you down
to the office myself.

01:10.204 --> 01:11.672
Sling me
over your shoulder?

01:11.705 --> 01:13.207
FRANK: You're backed
up six months.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.542
Oh, good,
you're here.

01:14.575 --> 01:15.843
Paramedics are
bringing in a guy

01:15.876 --> 01:17.245
who's out of his head
and combative,

01:17.278 --> 01:18.246
we could use
the extra set of hands.

01:18.279 --> 01:19.547
Want me to get
some Ativan?

01:19.580 --> 01:20.681
Well, they gave him
ten migs already.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.516
Hasn't touched him.

01:22.550 --> 01:25.286
Abby, don't go out there.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.321
I think Frank
has a crush on me.

01:27.355 --> 01:28.656
Oh, would you go see
the med staff, please?
(patient yelling)

01:28.689 --> 01:29.423
They're bugging me

01:29.457 --> 01:30.624
about your charts.

01:30.658 --> 01:31.392
Nemo Lynch, 32.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.526
There's a snake!

01:32.560 --> 01:34.228
Ran through the
Water Tower naked,

01:34.262 --> 01:35.463
Get the snake!
jumped through
a plate glass window

01:35.496 --> 01:37.331
and kept running.
Sounds like PCP.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.433
PRATT:
All right, 20
of ziprasidone IM.
Got it.

01:39.467 --> 01:40.701
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.236
Hey, you need
some help here?

01:42.270 --> 01:43.837
Moretti's got
me triaging.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.539
What am I supposed
to do?
Don't worry
about that.

01:45.573 --> 01:47.375
Just worry about keeping
the patients out of the doorway.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.177
Vitals are stable.
Abdomen's non-tender.

01:49.177 --> 01:50.378
Stab wounds
look superficial.

01:50.411 --> 01:53.847
So why is the E.R. calling
for a surgeon?

01:53.881 --> 01:55.283
Uh, you're a great
mentor, Neela.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.384
That was a question.

01:56.417 --> 01:59.853
Why does this guy
need an x-lap?

01:59.887 --> 02:02.823
Can't trust the exam
if the patient's too high.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.192
Are you listening
to a word I'm saying?

02:04.225 --> 02:05.393
Can I ask a question?

02:05.426 --> 02:06.694
It's a little
embarrassing...

02:06.727 --> 02:07.695
Well, it's better
to ask a dumb question

02:07.728 --> 02:09.363
rather than fake it.

02:09.396 --> 02:10.598
I appreciate
your attitude
towards that.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.233
I-I really do.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.567
I mean it's reassuring
to know that someday...

02:13.601 --> 02:14.902
Yeah, Harold,
sometime today.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.270
Uh, my girlfriend,
Lacey...

02:16.304 --> 02:17.571
her homecoming dance
is coming up.

02:17.605 --> 02:18.572
Homecoming dance?

02:18.606 --> 02:19.807
Yeah, she's in the court.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.209
Out of my league
looks-wise,

02:21.242 --> 02:22.743
but I guess there's
a certain cache

02:22.776 --> 02:25.746
in dating a doctor when
you're still in high school.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.415
Your girlfriend's
in high school?

02:27.448 --> 02:28.882
Yeah, she's a senior
at Woodland.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.685
Anyway, there are
certain skills,

02:31.719 --> 02:33.321
expectations...

02:33.354 --> 02:34.555
Certain rites
of passage

02:34.588 --> 02:36.224
that a certain
homecoming princess

02:36.224 --> 02:36.924
is gonna be counting on,

02:36.957 --> 02:38.459
you know?

02:38.492 --> 02:40.694
No, I'm not sure I do.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.330
(clears throat)

02:42.363 --> 02:44.365
I've never been
to the dance.

02:44.398 --> 02:49.537
I don't know how to do the mambo
or pin the corsage.

02:49.570 --> 02:50.904
Do you have any idea
what I'm talking about?

02:50.938 --> 02:52.640
You know, I didn't grow up
in this country,

02:52.673 --> 02:54.475
so I'm not sure
I'm the best person

02:54.508 --> 02:56.544
to answer this
question...
Neela. Help me.

02:56.577 --> 02:59.347
I'm-I'm a virgin.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.414
(moaning)

03:00.448 --> 03:01.549
You guys all right
in here?

03:01.582 --> 03:03.484
Get away, you freak!
That depends

03:03.517 --> 03:04.852
on your definition
of "all right."
You wrote the map on the skin,

03:04.885 --> 03:06.354
We're doing
just fine.
I know where you hid it.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.688
I will not

03:07.721 --> 03:08.956
be the conduit...

03:08.989 --> 03:10.358
(sighs)

03:10.391 --> 03:11.259
TAGGART:
Sedations kicking in.

03:11.259 --> 03:12.860
Interns,

03:12.893 --> 03:15.496
your first quarter
evaluations are
in your boxes.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.797
Find me if you want to discuss.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.266
Moretti, now's not a good time.

03:18.299 --> 03:19.267
Nobody told us
we were being tested.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.868
Every patient is a test:

03:20.901 --> 03:23.003
of your intellect, of your wit,
of your organizational skills.

03:23.036 --> 03:23.971
(chuckling):
Come on.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.806
Whoa!
Get the snake!

03:25.839 --> 03:27.007
Come on!
Shut up!

03:27.040 --> 03:28.309
And hold still.

03:28.342 --> 03:29.543
We're gonna get the snake.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.345
See that? Every
patient's a test,

03:31.379 --> 03:33.581
and Sam just got
an "A" this time.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.384
(screams)

03:36.417 --> 03:38.018
(laughing)

03:38.051 --> 03:39.887
I guess I spoke too soon.

03:39.920 --> 03:40.888
Oh.

03:49.663 --> 03:50.931
I stole this
from the GYN clinic.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.900
What?
I didn't steal
steal it.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.034
I'll-I'll take it back
just as soon you...

03:54.067 --> 03:55.603
I'm not touching
that thing.

03:55.636 --> 03:56.937
Just go over
the relevant anatomy.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.572
That's all I ask.
Oh, come on, man.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.441
Put that thing away.

04:00.474 --> 04:01.675
LOCKHART:
No free air
under the diaphragm.

04:01.709 --> 04:04.011
He's just so smug all the time.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.579
Have you ever met anybody
so smug?

04:05.613 --> 04:07.515
Let me guess. Moretti?

04:07.548 --> 04:08.982
Every time I come down,
you guys are talking

04:09.016 --> 04:10.518
about the
same thing.

04:10.551 --> 04:11.852
Well, he's an ass,

04:11.885 --> 04:14.455
but I can't deny
he's a smart guy.

04:14.488 --> 04:15.556
C-spine is fine.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.557
Should I take off
his collar?

04:16.589 --> 04:17.625
No, we'll do it upstairs.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.327
Well, this one's
a lot of fun.

04:19.327 --> 04:20.628
Make sure you get him up
before the sedation wears off.

04:20.661 --> 04:21.928
Here's everything
you need to know.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.497
Oh, we're good. Go.

04:23.531 --> 04:24.998
He can't hear anything,
right?
No.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.900
He's had enough sedation
to take down an elephant.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.502
Okay, so,
where exactly

04:28.536 --> 04:30.471
is the G-spot?

04:31.805 --> 04:33.807
(whispering):
Put that thing away.

04:35.476 --> 04:36.510
Hey! I hope
you're on top

04:36.544 --> 04:37.678
of your game tonight,
Lockhart.

04:37.711 --> 04:38.912
You know, I've got
the boards tomorrow.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.748
You're gonna be taking
all the hard cases.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.049
Why the hell are you working
the night before your boards?

04:42.082 --> 04:42.950
It was supposed
to be Morris' shift,

04:42.983 --> 04:44.485
but he's taking them, too.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.019
He couldn't find
anybody else?
Nope.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.488
And he swore

04:47.521 --> 04:49.723
that he would fail
if I didn't bail him out.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.625
But I'll do fine.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.060
I test well.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.462
What'd you hear
from Luka?

04:54.495 --> 04:56.430
Taking longer
than he expected.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.098
He has to retrofit
his dad's house
for a wheelchair, so.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.933
Oh.
STELLA:
This is completely
unfair.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.669
Guy's clearly
on a power trip.

05:01.702 --> 05:02.770
Abby, check this out.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.372
Four pages
of categories:

05:04.405 --> 05:06.039
Procedures,
patient relations,

05:06.073 --> 05:07.508
intellectual
curiosity--

05:07.541 --> 05:08.976
each rated
on a 1-to-5 scale.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.444
He gave us 1s
across the board.

05:10.478 --> 05:11.779
Is that good
or bad?
Bad!

05:11.812 --> 05:13.381
No comments, no
written feedback,

05:13.381 --> 05:14.715
just 1s.
So uncool.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.417
I'm never gonna get
a toxicology fellowship

05:16.450 --> 05:18.018
with this
on my record.
Oh, that's not true.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.388
That's not true.
Are we supposed
to learn from this?

05:20.388 --> 05:21.889
You have to
talk to him.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.491
Yeah, would you?
Please?

05:23.524 --> 05:24.592
Frank.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.826
What's up with the lab?

05:25.859 --> 05:27.628
I've been waiting three
hours for a CBC.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.930
Something about
a flow cytometer.
It'll be a while.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.800
Oh, your kid's school
called twice.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.435
Alex biting off
lizard heads again?

05:34.468 --> 05:36.437
Shut up, Frank.
He's not a sociopath.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.638
That's right. Ignore the
problem. It'll go away.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.072
Well, it's too late.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.742
I have to call 'em
tomorrow morning.
Mm-hmm.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.478
MORETTI:
Hey, uh, Sam.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.113
You're supposed to be covering
triage right now.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.615
What?
Yeah.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.082
Nurses rotate every two hours.
You're up.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.084
Come on.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.556
Excuse me.

05:55.589 --> 05:56.490
Yeah. Hi.

05:56.524 --> 05:59.460
Hi.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.761
Listen, slamming
the interns

06:00.794 --> 06:02.496
without giving any
concrete suggestions

06:02.530 --> 06:03.764
isn't helping anybody.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.434
These numeric
evaluations are...

06:06.467 --> 06:07.601
useless.

06:07.635 --> 06:08.569
Don't worry, Abby.

06:08.602 --> 06:09.903
I gave you solid 3s.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.539
Yeah, listen,
they're freaking out

06:11.572 --> 06:12.840
about the bad
evaluation

06:12.873 --> 06:15.509
instead of focusing
on how to improve.

06:15.543 --> 06:16.510
Illustrating
my point.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.111
Which is what, exactly?

06:18.145 --> 06:20.581
Are they concerned about giving
the patients sub-optimal care?

06:20.614 --> 06:22.450
No. What they're
worried about

06:22.450 --> 06:24.718
is how it's gonna look
on their record.
They need mentors,

06:24.752 --> 06:25.686
constructive feedback,

06:25.719 --> 06:26.854
guidance...
No.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.456
You know, they're
just kids.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.524
Arrogance and inexperience
are a lethal combination.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.693
But there's gotta be
a more effective way
of teaching them that

06:32.726 --> 06:34.094
than completely
breaking them...
Abby, look, I...

06:34.127 --> 06:36.196
I understand it's your natural
instinct to listen,

06:36.229 --> 06:38.599
to wanna be supportive
and to, you know...

06:38.632 --> 06:39.867
but in the end

06:39.900 --> 06:41.569
with...

06:45.072 --> 06:45.806
Forget it.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.708
Can't...

06:49.710 --> 06:50.678
Excuse me.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.513
All right, hang on a bit.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.482
Okay, ma'am, why are you here?

06:54.482 --> 06:55.583
He's got a cough.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.050
Oh, yeah?
Let me see.
(cries)

06:57.084 --> 06:59.953
Hey. Let me see.
His breathing's okay.
You know what?

06:59.987 --> 07:01.689
I'll try to get you back
as soon as I can, all right?

07:01.722 --> 07:03.524
But...
GIRL:
Hello.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.959
Uh, sir, let me see your hand.
Let me see.

07:05.993 --> 07:06.860
Come over here.
Sit down.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.028
GIRL:
Hey!

07:08.061 --> 07:09.830
Hey!
Yes?

07:09.863 --> 07:10.798
I've been here
for three hours.

07:10.831 --> 07:11.999
This guy
just walked in.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.233
Yeah, well,
this guy's bleeding.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.603
Okay, well,
my head is exploding.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.605
You look comfortable to me.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.507
Don't tell me
what I'm feeling.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.708
(sighs)

07:20.741 --> 07:22.242
All right,
you get headaches a lot?

07:22.275 --> 07:24.211
Never like this.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.012
All right.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.246
Here, grab that.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.682
I'll get back
to you in a second.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.083
Follow me.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.752
This place is gross.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.086
Well, you get
used to it.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.622
What's your name?
Heather.

07:34.655 --> 07:37.758
Heather, I'm Dr. Gates.
This is Sam.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.527
Sam, Heather here says she has

07:39.560 --> 07:40.628
an exploding
headache.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.564
Hmm, let's get you checked out.

07:43.597 --> 07:44.632
Moretti have you working
in Waiting?

07:44.665 --> 07:45.666
Yeah, all day.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.967
Don't take it personally.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.201
He's doing that
to all the residents.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.937
I better get back.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.039
Take a seat
over here.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.140
On a scale
of one to ten,

07:53.173 --> 07:54.842
how bad is your headache?

07:54.875 --> 07:56.276
Ten.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.811
You're pretty calm
for a ten.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.280
Yeah, so,
you think I'm lying?

08:00.313 --> 08:02.049
I have a high tolerance
for pain.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.250
Where are your parents?

08:03.283 --> 08:05.919
I don't know. Out.

08:05.953 --> 08:06.820
Okay, well,
give me their numbers.

08:06.854 --> 08:07.988
We can examine you,

08:08.021 --> 08:09.022
but we need their
permission

08:09.056 --> 08:10.057
for any treatment.
Sam.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.258
You seen Pratt?

08:11.291 --> 08:13.694
He's in Exam 3
reducing a shoulder.

08:13.727 --> 08:14.895
Are you on
tonight?

08:14.928 --> 08:16.730
You mean on as in lively
and invigorated

08:16.764 --> 08:18.031
or on as in working?

08:18.065 --> 08:18.766
What?

08:18.799 --> 08:21.602
Morris.

08:21.635 --> 08:22.269
What are you doing?

08:22.302 --> 08:23.637
I'm looking for you.

08:23.671 --> 08:24.938
Why aren't you
home studying?

08:24.972 --> 08:26.173
No, no, no, I-I got too much
nervous energy.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.307
There's no way
I'm gonna be able to sleep.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.276
I came in so
we could study together.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.144
Wait, wait, the only reason
I took over your shift

08:31.178 --> 08:32.580
was so that you could stay home.

08:32.580 --> 08:33.681
Come on. Come on.

08:33.714 --> 08:34.682
We can help each other
get psyched,

08:34.715 --> 08:35.716
get-get focused...

08:35.749 --> 08:37.150
Listen, if you're here, I'm out.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.053
Dude, you need to work
on your game face.

08:40.087 --> 08:40.854
What?

08:40.888 --> 08:41.955
Game face, Greg.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.657
What's wrong with you?

08:43.691 --> 08:45.893
Shrug your shoulders.

08:45.926 --> 08:46.994
Can I open my eyes now?

08:47.027 --> 08:48.929
Yeah.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.130
Okay,
the good news is

08:50.163 --> 08:52.199
your neuro exam
is totally normal,

08:52.232 --> 08:54.635
but you have trigger
points in your neck.
Which means?

08:54.668 --> 08:55.903
It's a tension headache.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.305
You'll feel better
with some ibuprofen.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.608
Aren't you gonna do a
CAT scan or something?

09:00.641 --> 09:02.843
You don't need one.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.177
Well, do one
anyway.

09:04.211 --> 09:07.047
We don't do tests just
'cause patients want them.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.315
Why not?

09:08.348 --> 09:10.217
It's a waste
of resources.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.885
Okay, well, make
my dad pay.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.187
'Cause he's rich.
That's not
really the issue.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.890
You just said it was
about resources, so...

09:16.924 --> 09:18.358
Is this your home
phone number?

09:18.391 --> 09:19.627
Yeah.

09:19.627 --> 09:20.728
So when I call it,

09:20.761 --> 09:22.630
why do I get a video
rental store?

09:22.630 --> 09:24.031
Video rental?

09:24.064 --> 09:26.967
I didn't even know
those still existed.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.136
That isn't funny.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.871
My mom is dead
and my dad is in New York

09:30.904 --> 09:32.706
and he doesn't need you guys
bothering him.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.975
So, not that big a deal.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.744
600 of ibuprofen
once you get

09:36.777 --> 09:38.045
the dad's consent.
And give us his real number.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.212
No more games.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.681
That was so cool,

09:40.714 --> 09:42.082
defending us
from Moretti like that.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.051
Well, we were just
discussing

09:44.084 --> 09:46.219
different teaching
philosophies.
Well, yours is better.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.288
Which is why there's no way
I'm gonna present to him.

09:48.321 --> 09:51.124
You got a minute?
You can't boycott
an attending.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.225
I can't?

09:52.259 --> 09:53.761
Come on.
Just for today.

09:53.794 --> 09:54.895
GATES:
My point is,
hanging out

09:54.928 --> 09:56.864
in the waiting area
is inefficient.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.699
Just get back out
there, Gates.
I should be here
clearing beds,

09:58.732 --> 10:00.668
Moretti, and
you know it.
Look, last month
a woman arrested

10:00.701 --> 10:03.904
in an ER waiting room because
nobody was paying attention.

10:03.937 --> 10:04.905
Brian?

10:05.706 --> 10:07.007
Hey.
Hey.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.241
What are you doing?
13-year-old male

10:08.275 --> 10:10.143
in acute respiratory distress.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.344
Tony.

10:11.378 --> 10:12.412
It's really bad this time.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.947
All right.
I know this kid.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.983
He's got a progressive
neuromuscular disorder.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.651
I know him
from ICU.
Okay.

10:17.685 --> 10:20.053
Hey, buddy,
how you doing?

10:20.087 --> 10:20.854
Pretty good.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.389
Yeah?

10:22.422 --> 10:24.825
Did you see D. Lee hit
for the cycle last night?

10:24.858 --> 10:27.127
No, I missed it. You're
gonna have to give me
a play-by-play, huh?

10:27.160 --> 10:28.896
Pulse ox is only 78.
Let's go.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.230
He needs oxygen.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.799
Sam, you're with me.
Where we going?

10:31.832 --> 10:33.166
Uh, Trauma 1.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.002
Brian, wait right here.
I'll be right back.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.004
HEATHER:
Hey! Hey!
Let's set up a
non-rebreather

10:37.037 --> 10:39.072
and, uh, let's get
an ABG going.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.908
Find someone else
to cover triage.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.242
I'm staying
with this kid.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.847
He left?
What do you mean he left?

10:46.880 --> 10:49.316
He was here, and
then he was gone.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.018
Is that clear
enough for you?

10:51.051 --> 10:52.452
Did he say where
he was going?

10:52.485 --> 10:55.255
Frank, where's the
Crohn's fistula?

10:55.288 --> 10:56.857
Ask me again
in English.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.726
Uh! Never mind.
I found her.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.728
Do women often need
additional lubrication?

11:00.728 --> 11:02.796
Harold, get a consult form.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.032
I mean, it seems like if you're
willing to put in the time

11:05.065 --> 11:06.366
to sufficiently
stimulate the area...

11:06.399 --> 11:08.068
You know, isn't there
anyone in your life

11:08.101 --> 11:09.737
who'd be more appropriate
for this talk?

11:09.737 --> 11:13.140
Like a brother?
Uncle? Anyone?

11:13.173 --> 11:14.742
No, just Grandpa

11:14.775 --> 11:15.475
and he thinks I still
believe in the stork.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.177
Dr. Moretti, is there

11:17.210 --> 11:19.847
anything special I should know
about the Crohn's lady?

11:19.880 --> 11:21.281
She's narcissistic.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.482
She's addicted
to morphine,

11:22.515 --> 11:24.151
and if she says
that she's allergic

11:24.184 --> 11:25.886
to NSAIDs,
she's lying.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.087
Thanks for the warning.

11:28.822 --> 11:32.492
Excuse me. I'm looking
for... you, Dr. Moretti.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.961
I'm Skye Wexler,
your new attending.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.796
We spoke on the phone.

11:35.829 --> 11:38.031
Oh, yeah. I didn't realize
you were starting already.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.232
Yeah, tonight's the night.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.801
Uh... All right.
Uh... follow me.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.502
Will you, um, uh,

11:42.535 --> 11:44.271
write your initials
in this column over here

11:44.304 --> 11:45.939
when you pick up a patient,

11:45.973 --> 11:48.776
and chart any progress in
this column over here. Okay?

11:48.809 --> 11:50.978
Frank, sorry, this
is Dr. Wexler.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.479
She's gonna be taking
some shifts with us

11:52.512 --> 11:54.347
over the next
month or so,

11:54.381 --> 11:56.049
and this is one of
our lifers, Haleh.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.417
Hey.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.886
Hello.

11:58.919 --> 11:59.787
Hi.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.221
You new to Chicago?

12:01.254 --> 12:03.991
Doing locums to make
some extra cash.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.026
Locums?

12:06.059 --> 12:08.862
Yes. Like moonlighting,
mostly nights.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.798
Ah. That's when I work, too.

12:10.798 --> 12:13.333
Oh, yeah. So much better
than being stuck

12:13.366 --> 12:15.803
in a hospital all day
when it's beautiful outside.

12:15.803 --> 12:18.906
I hear you. I'm a
big hiker myself.

12:18.939 --> 12:21.408
You bump your head?

12:21.441 --> 12:23.410
Hang in there, Josh.
You're almost done.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.946
ABG's back. 7.18.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.881
CO2's 66.
Yeah.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.049
He's retaining.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.483
What's that mean?

12:30.517 --> 12:32.085
It means he's tiring out.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.954
You try breathing
50 times a minute.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.455
You're gonna have
washboard abs after this.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.827
Heart line's in.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.962
That's so we can check your
blood gasses without needles.

12:41.995 --> 12:42.963
You see the shadow?

12:42.996 --> 12:44.431
Is that fluid?

12:44.464 --> 12:46.433
Yeah, most likely
aspiration pneumonia.

12:46.466 --> 12:49.102
His swallowing muscles are
weak, it's not protecting his...

12:49.136 --> 12:50.170
Airway.
Right.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.371
I never
should have let you go

12:51.404 --> 12:53.273
to that Kelly
Clarkson concert.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.976
That's not why I have pneumonia.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.978
Did she just say Kelly Clarkson?

12:58.011 --> 12:58.946
You have a problem with that?

12:58.979 --> 13:00.313
Good thing
you're sick,

13:00.347 --> 13:01.882
because I'd be giving
you so much crap.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.016
Kelly Clarkson?

13:03.050 --> 13:04.918
Hey, Sam, gram
of ceftriaxone

13:04.952 --> 13:07.520
and a liter of NS.

13:07.554 --> 13:08.922
Which one of
you is Pratt?

13:08.956 --> 13:10.290
That'd be him.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.959
Hey, I'm Skye Wexler,
new attending.

13:11.992 --> 13:12.926
I'm doing the
overnights with you.

13:12.960 --> 13:13.861
Oh, nice to meet you.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.028
We should call
Hopkins.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.029
We're supposed
to report any ER visits

13:16.063 --> 13:17.464
to the study
coordinator.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.199
SKYE:
I heard you have
the boards tomorrow.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.401
Yeah.
I'll hang here
so you can study.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.435
Really.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.904
Go.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.038
Gates, you good
with this?

13:25.072 --> 13:27.540
Yeah.
All right, buddy.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.476
We'll get you feeling
better soon, okay?

13:29.509 --> 13:32.145
Looks like you're stuck
with me, Josh.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.080
SKYE:
Let me take a look at the film.

13:33.113 --> 13:33.580
TAGGART:
Here.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.115
Here you go.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.350
Your feet must be tired.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.391
This hospital bites.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.259
I've been here for hours,
and nobody's done anything.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.561
We get busy.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.130
What are you doing?

13:50.163 --> 13:51.631
Trying to find someone
who gives a crap.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.333
Yeah, well, those computers
are for staff only.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.602
Go back to your bed.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.004
(huffs)

13:57.037 --> 13:58.171
Hey, did you hear me?

13:58.205 --> 13:59.439
I have chest pain

13:59.472 --> 14:01.909
and it's really, really bad.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.011
I'll get someone
to check you out, okay?

14:04.044 --> 14:05.578
How is the boy doing?

14:05.612 --> 14:07.314
Struggling, headed for a tube.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.916
So what are you
doing out here?

14:08.916 --> 14:10.383
The new attending came in.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.919
She said that
she'd take over.
Wait, wait, wait.

14:11.919 --> 14:12.920
You left a patient

14:12.920 --> 14:14.354
in respiratory failure

14:14.387 --> 14:17.925
with an untested attending
that you've never met?

14:17.958 --> 14:18.591
Oh, well, I...

14:18.625 --> 14:19.927
I'm kidding.

14:19.927 --> 14:20.928
I sent her in there.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.262
(chuckles)

14:23.396 --> 14:25.465
(laughs)
Okay, thanks.

14:25.498 --> 14:26.499
Hey, Doctor.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.667
Check me out.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.569
Hey, what happened?

14:29.602 --> 14:31.038
There you are.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.205
You show up out of nowhere
and then

14:32.239 --> 14:33.440
suddenly you disappear.
(laughs)

14:33.473 --> 14:35.175
How you doing?
Good.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.944
You seem busy,
so I don't want to...
Yeah, well...

14:36.977 --> 14:39.179
I don't want
to get in your way.
Is everything all right?

14:39.212 --> 14:41.214
You look
like hell.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.582
(laughs)
Oh, I...

14:42.615 --> 14:44.084
No, I drove all night
to get here, so...

14:44.117 --> 14:45.618
Oh.
Yeah.

14:45.652 --> 14:49.689
Dr. Pratt, I'm sorry.
This is, uh, Brian, my son.

14:49.722 --> 14:50.690
Oh, really?

14:50.723 --> 14:52.292
Hey.
Yeah, yeah.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.161
Hey, aren't you in college
on the East Coast?

14:54.194 --> 14:56.063
Yes, he is.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.165
And now this is the part
where you tell me

14:58.198 --> 14:59.599
why you're not
in school

14:59.632 --> 15:02.502
(laughs)
and you're here
visiting me at work.

15:02.535 --> 15:03.436
What's that?

15:03.470 --> 15:07.440
Happy Birthday, Dad.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.476
You drove all night
to give me a book?

15:09.509 --> 15:12.479
No, it's not just a book.
It's not just a book.
It's not just a book.

15:12.512 --> 15:15.582
It's like a new way
of thinking.
Really?

15:15.615 --> 15:17.117
All right, well...

15:17.150 --> 15:18.618
You remember when
you were in college

15:18.651 --> 15:20.253
and you got so excited about
everything that you learned?

15:20.287 --> 15:21.521
(both chuckle)

15:21.554 --> 15:23.356
Come on, let's get
out of here, um...

15:23.390 --> 15:24.624
You look like you haven't
eaten in a week.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.393
Nice to meet you.
Okay, hey,

15:26.426 --> 15:28.228
Skye has my sign-out.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.263
All right.

15:33.300 --> 15:36.069
It's the natural course
of Fazio-Londe disease.

15:36.103 --> 15:38.005
Eventually, the respiratory
muscles aren't strong enough

15:38.005 --> 15:39.606
to clear secretions.

15:39.639 --> 15:42.209
So there are no
other options.

15:48.348 --> 15:51.384
This is Dr. Bazzano
from pediatric neurology.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.486
Hi, Joshua.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.022
You're
his mom?
Yeah.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.557
Acidosis is worse.

15:58.591 --> 16:01.028
So... listen up, buddy.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.330
Your, uh, your muscles
that help you breathe

16:03.363 --> 16:06.566
are starting to get tired.

16:06.599 --> 16:09.569
Tell me something I don't know.

16:09.602 --> 16:12.039
So we're going to have
to put a tube down

16:12.072 --> 16:14.641
and, um, that will
breathe for you.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.276
SERENA:
Oh, God.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.310
TAGGART:
The ventilator
is temporary.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.645
It'll give his muscles a rest

16:18.678 --> 16:21.114
so the antibiotics
can do their thing.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.383
And after the pneumonia
is treated, we can take

16:23.416 --> 16:24.417
the tube out?

16:24.451 --> 16:27.254
Well, that's the hope.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.389
Okay.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.091
It's going
to be okay.

16:31.124 --> 16:34.094
We talked about
this possibility.

16:34.127 --> 16:35.395
BAZZANO:
I have to run upstairs.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.764
I'll see you guys
up in the ICU.

16:37.797 --> 16:41.068
Thanks, Doctor.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.070
Do you understand
everything the doctors

16:43.070 --> 16:44.504
are saying?

16:44.537 --> 16:47.074
Yeah.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.075
Mom?

16:48.075 --> 16:50.543
Yeah, honey?

16:50.577 --> 16:54.181
This situation
demands a Slushee.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.416
Josh, sorry,
but you've got to be NPO.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.552
Ah, come on, let's, let's
give the kid a Slushee, huh?

16:59.586 --> 17:02.389
We can live
with that, huh?

17:02.422 --> 17:04.290
Sweet.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.694
Okay.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.362
Where do I...?

17:09.396 --> 17:10.696
The Jumbo Mart.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.499
My kid loves 'em, too.
It's across the street.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.202
Come on.
I'll take you.

17:15.234 --> 17:17.237
Be right back.

17:23.109 --> 17:25.145
Good catch.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.317
You're not tubing me.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.557
Headache's gone.
Now it's chest pain.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.127
EKG was fine.
Exam was normal.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.594
Did you do a beta-HCG?

17:41.628 --> 17:42.695
Could explain
this whole thing.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.164
Keep her on oxygen.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.498
Call if she has
any more sustained decels.

17:48.635 --> 17:51.171
Abby, HCG?

17:51.204 --> 17:51.771
Oh, yeah.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.140
It was negative.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.808
I have to check
on a sick asthmatic.

17:55.842 --> 17:56.843
Oh, that's cool.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.145
I got this.
Okay.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.548
Hey.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.317
I'm Dr. Wexler.
I'm in charge tonight.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.719
Lucky you.

18:06.753 --> 18:07.820
Deep breath.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.489
I can't.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.191
You can try.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.225
(exhales quickly)

18:16.396 --> 18:17.397
Again.

18:17.430 --> 18:21.301
(exhaling quickly)

18:21.334 --> 18:23.170
Well, your heart and
lungs sound good.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.238
Oxygen level is perfect.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.807
Better keep looking then.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.509
You know, your pain
can't be that bad

18:29.542 --> 18:32.379
if you're able to text your
friends all through my exam.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.546
I'm not texting.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.648
I'm trying to get online.
Hmm.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.450
Reception in here sucks.

18:37.484 --> 18:38.451
Look, is there
a computer in here

18:38.485 --> 18:40.187
that I can use or something?

18:40.220 --> 18:41.921
RASGOTRA:
Dr. Wexler, do you
know where Pratt is?

18:41.954 --> 18:43.890
I can't find him anywhere.
You could try
the break room.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.692
I know he's studying.
Thanks.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.761
Sorry about that.
You were saying?

18:48.795 --> 18:49.762
Just forget it.

18:49.796 --> 18:50.897
Never mind.

18:58.905 --> 19:03.443
Of course, we have the grande
olde dame of cramming: caffeine.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.577
Grande olde dame?

19:04.611 --> 19:06.246
300 milligrams,
baby,

19:06.279 --> 19:08.315
keep our engines nice
and revved.

19:08.348 --> 19:10.250
Oh, and this.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.485
Okay, this...

19:12.519 --> 19:15.788
this is the silver bullet.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.957
If you get stuck
on the test,

19:17.990 --> 19:19.726
squeeze this,
the answer will come.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.831
Hey, I don't need
any good luck charms.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.833
You can't reject
a good luck charm.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.836
That's like the opposite
of good luck, as in bad luck.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.239
I don't believe in luck,
I believe in preparation,

19:32.272 --> 19:34.674
and I'm prepared.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.244
Whoa, what's all this?

19:37.277 --> 19:38.811
Well, you know, we got
the boards tomorrow.

19:38.845 --> 19:42.515
And, uh...
how exactly does this fit in?

19:42.549 --> 19:45.252
Something to perk us up
when our stamina flags.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.620
Well, do you guys mind if
Harold hangs here for a while?

19:47.654 --> 19:49.756
He could benefit from
your, uh, tutelage.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.791
No, no way, we have
too much ground to cover.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.460
Oh, come on, if you
don't know it by now,

19:53.493 --> 19:55.962
this isn't gonna help.
That's not necessarily true.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.797
Studies have shown
that cramming can improve

19:57.830 --> 19:59.499
short-term performance.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.334
See? Have a seat, Harold.

20:01.368 --> 20:02.635
Oh, excellent.

20:02.669 --> 20:06.239
Great guys-- smart, experienced.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.241
So what topics do
you want to cover?

20:08.275 --> 20:12.245
Uh, just some basic
fundamentals.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.716
No appetite?

20:16.749 --> 20:18.451
Dairy is pumped
full of hormones

20:18.485 --> 20:19.819
and wheat is
genetically modified.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.454
Right.

20:21.488 --> 20:24.591
Uh, okay, I'll try to find you
some organic Jell-O.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.959
Urine aminolevulinic acid
is elevated,

20:26.993 --> 20:28.961
suggests a problem
with porphyrin metabolism.

20:28.995 --> 20:32.999
Hmm... she does seem to have
a serious fear of food.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.937
Acute porphyria can be brought
on by caloric restriction.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.872
Well, see, it fits.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.709
Hematology said to order
an erythrocyte enzyme assay.

20:42.742 --> 20:43.943
Okay.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.478
Cool case, Grady,
but make sure

20:45.512 --> 20:46.546
to keep moving the
other patients through.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.881
Okay.

20:50.617 --> 20:51.851
Hey, Abby.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.420
Hey.
How is everything?

20:53.453 --> 20:55.422
It's better.

20:55.455 --> 20:56.956
Much better.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.024
You been going
to meetings?

20:58.057 --> 20:59.459
Yes.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.394
Okay, 'cause
I haven't seen you.

21:01.428 --> 21:04.897
Well, the last couple times,
I, um, I worked late,

21:04.931 --> 21:07.467
so I couldn't make it
to St. Mark's.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.001
Oh, I see.

21:09.035 --> 21:10.537
And I kind of wanted

21:10.570 --> 21:14.006
to go somewhere...
where... nobody knew me.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.775
Hmm.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.810
Why is that?

21:17.844 --> 21:21.514
I don't know.

21:21.548 --> 21:23.616
Well, look the, um, church
on Franklin has got meetings

21:23.650 --> 21:24.717
all hours,
day and night.

21:24.751 --> 21:25.985
Okay.

21:26.018 --> 21:26.986
Thanks.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.055
That's good to know.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.562
When your
infection clears,

21:35.595 --> 21:36.796
your vital capacity
will improve

21:36.829 --> 21:39.999
and they'll take
the tube out.

21:40.032 --> 21:41.468
Be real.

21:41.501 --> 21:42.669
I'll never get
off the vent.

21:42.702 --> 21:45.872
Ah, don't say
that, Josh.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.574
I've been thinking
about this moment

21:47.607 --> 21:52.078
pretty much continuously
since I got my diagnosis.

21:52.111 --> 21:53.012
No tube.

21:53.045 --> 21:54.414
So that's it?

21:54.447 --> 21:56.783
You're just going
to give up now?

21:56.816 --> 22:01.421
And... I need to make it look
like it's your decision.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.390
What?

22:03.390 --> 22:08.094
It would kill my mom
if she knew this was my idea.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.562
I promised her I'd fight.

22:09.596 --> 22:11.398
So fight.

22:11.398 --> 22:12.765
They're doing research
on neuromuscular diseases

22:12.799 --> 22:14.066
all over the world.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.835
It's not going
to help me now.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.604
They could come up with
a breakthrough tomorrow, Josh.

22:17.637 --> 22:21.007
They're years away
from a cure.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.877
Whether we like it or not,
this is happening.

22:24.911 --> 22:29.582
My mom can start getting
over it now or a year from now

22:29.616 --> 22:32.051
when she's given up everything
to be by my bedside

22:32.084 --> 22:34.821
while I wither away
on a ventilator.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.589
Josh...

22:36.623 --> 22:39.659
Tony, you get me.

22:42.662 --> 22:45.598
I know you understand.

22:52.004 --> 22:54.106
He's a bright kid.
He knows what's in store.

22:54.140 --> 22:57.176
Intellectual understanding isn't
the same as emotional maturity.

22:57.209 --> 23:01.448
No. I know him.
He understands
what he's doing.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.950
You absolutely sure
about this?

23:03.983 --> 23:06.052
Yeah.

23:06.085 --> 23:09.456
Okay. Do me a favor
and run it by Ethics.

23:09.456 --> 23:10.990
You can tell them
your attending's onboard.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.725
Thank you.

23:15.528 --> 23:16.996
Hey, Sam.

23:17.029 --> 23:18.064
It is Sam, right?

23:18.097 --> 23:20.132
Yeah.
Could you give

23:20.166 --> 23:22.969
our asthmatic in 2
125 of Solu-Medrol?

23:23.002 --> 23:25.472
Uh... I already did.

23:25.505 --> 23:26.906
Part of Moretti's
new asthma protocol.

23:26.939 --> 23:28.174
You don't need doctor's orders

23:28.207 --> 23:29.609
if the patient meets
certain criteria.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.478
Efficient. I like it.

23:31.511 --> 23:33.012
Could I take a look?

23:33.045 --> 23:36.015
Sure. Hey, Frank, do you
have an asthma flowchart?

23:36.048 --> 23:38.685
Hey, kid.

23:38.718 --> 23:41.888
This is a hospital,
not an internet cafe.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.723
TAGGART:
What's wrong with you?

23:43.756 --> 23:45.692
What is wrong with you?

23:45.725 --> 23:48.695
I called your dad and somebody's
on their way to come get you.

23:48.728 --> 23:51.030
You shouldn't have done that.
He didn't want to be bothered.

23:51.063 --> 23:52.198
Of course he does.

23:52.231 --> 23:53.866
How can you possibly say that?

23:53.900 --> 23:55.735
You don't know him
and you don't know me.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.504
Because I'm a parent
and I understand a parent...

23:57.537 --> 23:59.706
Oh, shut up,
you phony bitch.

24:02.642 --> 24:06.045
It's like, um,
it's already after 3:00.

24:06.078 --> 24:08.881
I think it's about
time we go to bed.

24:08.915 --> 24:12.184
No. I think it's time we opened
another bottle of champagne.

24:12.218 --> 24:13.920
Here.
Really?

24:13.953 --> 24:15.922
Mm-hmm.

24:15.955 --> 24:19.191
Did I tell you
I'm taking a course
on the history of wine?

24:19.225 --> 24:20.860
No.
I know, I know.

24:20.893 --> 24:23.930
It sounds like, uh, major
slacker territory, huh?

24:23.963 --> 24:25.197
But it's actually this

24:25.231 --> 24:27.199
awesome survey
of Western civilization.

24:27.233 --> 24:29.001
I mean there's
the Last Supper,

24:29.035 --> 24:31.938
the Spanish Inquisition,
the Yalta Conference--

24:31.971 --> 24:34.040
you name it, somehow
wine was involved.

24:34.073 --> 24:35.742
Yeah, well, wine is...
Oh!

24:35.775 --> 24:38.878
I switched my major
to semiotics.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.179
Oh.

24:40.212 --> 24:44.584
A degree in the meaning
of meaning.

24:44.617 --> 24:47.654
I mean could there be
anything cooler than that?

24:47.687 --> 24:49.021
No, I don't...

24:49.055 --> 24:50.690
But Brian...

24:50.723 --> 24:52.559
I know what you're
going to say, I know.

24:52.559 --> 24:54.060
I don't want to be
premed though, Dad.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.695
I don't. I thought you
were cool with that.

24:55.728 --> 24:58.297
No, I am. That's not...

24:58.330 --> 25:00.600
Why... why are you here?

25:00.633 --> 25:01.901
It's your birthday.

25:01.934 --> 25:06.573
All right, but what's
the real reason?

25:06.573 --> 25:07.940
It's...

25:07.974 --> 25:10.843
I remember when I was,
uh, in fourth grade.

25:10.877 --> 25:14.313
You showed up and you said--

25:14.346 --> 25:16.649
it was right before
lunch-- and you said

25:16.683 --> 25:19.085
we were going to go on this
secret surprise mission.

25:19.118 --> 25:20.653
That's what you said.
Uh-huh.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.889
And I remember,
I remember...

25:22.922 --> 25:24.991
looking out the
window of the car

25:25.024 --> 25:26.893
just, I'm thinking,
I'm wondering,

25:26.926 --> 25:29.829
"Where are we going to go?"

25:29.862 --> 25:33.700
And that, I just-- I swear,
that was just one of the...

25:33.733 --> 25:36.703
that was the most exciting
moment of my life.

25:38.771 --> 25:42.041
You're talking about the time
we went ice fishing?

25:42.074 --> 25:43.610
Yeah.

25:43.610 --> 25:46.913
It was you and me and the lake.

25:46.946 --> 25:50.016
And... I, I just...

25:51.851 --> 25:53.219
I just, I wanted to...

25:53.252 --> 25:57.657
I wanted to...
to thank you. Thanks.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.325
For that, thanks.

26:03.195 --> 26:04.731
You're welcome.

26:06.132 --> 26:07.800
(chuckles)

26:11.303 --> 26:12.739
I'll call the school.

26:12.772 --> 26:15.842
They can send the
syllabus to the ICU.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.243
Thanks, Mom.

26:17.276 --> 26:20.012
Sat is 81.
You guys ready?

26:20.046 --> 26:22.181
Actually, we're
going to hold off.

26:22.214 --> 26:23.783
TAGGART:
What do you mean, "hold off"?

26:23.816 --> 26:29.021
We're not intubating.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.157
He won't tolerate the pressure
generated by the ventilator.

26:31.190 --> 26:33.292
But I thought you said
before that he...

26:33.325 --> 26:34.994
GATES:
No, but I have new
information now

26:35.027 --> 26:36.663
and the clinical picture
has changed.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.765
What kind of
new information?

26:42.268 --> 26:44.771
Are you onboard
with this?

26:44.804 --> 26:45.938
Dr. Gates and I
have discussed

26:45.972 --> 26:48.174
the options at length.

26:48.207 --> 26:49.876
TAGGART:
You really think
it's such a good idea

26:49.909 --> 26:51.243
on your first night attending?

26:51.277 --> 26:53.780
I've been attending
for ten years.

26:54.881 --> 26:55.982
I don't understand.

26:56.015 --> 26:57.850
This wasn't the plan.

26:57.884 --> 26:59.418
Well, we have
a different plan now.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.721
But he's in
respiratory failure.

27:01.754 --> 27:04.423
We'll give him medicine
to keep him comfortable

27:04.456 --> 27:06.759
and we'll take away
the air hunger.

27:06.793 --> 27:07.794
Tony, no...

27:07.827 --> 27:09.228
Trust him, Mom.

27:27.179 --> 27:28.247
Okay.

27:36.889 --> 27:38.791
How's your new,
uh, interns doing?

27:38.825 --> 27:40.760
Uh, overzealous
and inexperienced,

27:40.793 --> 27:42.762
but they seem
like an okay bunch.

27:42.795 --> 27:45.097
Well, I had to send mine
to man camp today.

27:45.131 --> 27:47.299
MORRIS:
So I wake up the next morning
and I look over,

27:47.333 --> 27:49.969
and that best-in-show hottie
from the night before?

27:50.002 --> 27:51.971
Big, hairy mustache.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.406
(men laughing)

27:54.440 --> 27:55.842
And that, my young lads,
is why drinking is bad.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.877
(groans)

27:57.910 --> 28:00.747
LOCKHART:
Looks like you have your noses
to the grindstone in here.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.381
Yeah, well, we got
a little distracted.

28:02.414 --> 28:03.850
It's only 4:00.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.351
The night is still young, huh?

28:05.384 --> 28:07.053
Go! Go!

28:07.086 --> 28:09.021
MEN (chanting):
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

28:09.055 --> 28:10.289
Harold!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

28:10.322 --> 28:11.758
(groans)

28:11.758 --> 28:13.425
Harold, I need you
upstairs, now.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.461
But we were just getting
to toys and accessories.

28:15.494 --> 28:17.864
It's not an
invitation.

28:17.897 --> 28:20.099
Abby, paranoid chemical lady
in 2 dropped her pressure.

28:20.132 --> 28:21.768
All right.
Come on. Party's over. Come on.

28:24.971 --> 28:26.939
Whatever poisonous
advice they gave you,

28:26.973 --> 28:28.808
you must forget
it immediately.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.109
Most of what they said
made a lot of sense.

28:30.142 --> 28:31.811
What did they tell you?

28:31.844 --> 28:33.445
Well, Morris said the
greatest sex happens

28:33.479 --> 28:34.914
when you're in love.
Oh.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.415
He did?
Yeah.

28:36.448 --> 28:38.017
And all Pratt talked
about was how to keep

28:38.050 --> 28:39.485
the lines of
communication open.

28:39.518 --> 28:41.253
You're joking.

28:41.287 --> 28:43.823
I do still have some
unanswered questions, though.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.524
Do two orgasms
40 minutes apart

28:45.557 --> 28:47.493
still qualify as multiple?

28:49.561 --> 28:51.197
Pulse ox is 84.
PRATT: All right,

28:51.230 --> 28:52.531
crank up the O2.
It's progressive.

28:52.564 --> 28:53.900
There's no cure.
Abby, intubate.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.467
He has the
right to stop.

28:55.501 --> 28:57.269
Oh, what about his mother?
Doesn't she have any rights?

28:57.303 --> 28:59.238
My obligation is to my
patient, not to his mother.

28:59.271 --> 29:01.373
Josh doesn't want his mom
to know about this.
He's 13!

29:01.407 --> 29:03.342
People make bad decisions
when they're 13.

29:03.375 --> 29:04.811
Laying in bed being
hooked up to a ventilator?

29:04.844 --> 29:06.813
It's not a life.
He can still think.

29:06.813 --> 29:08.981
He can communicate.
Maybe he's around when
they discover a cure.

29:09.015 --> 29:10.549
He doesn't want to lay
around in bed hooked up

29:10.582 --> 29:12.551
to a bunch of machines
waiting for a miracle.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.053
What part of that
do you not understand?

29:14.086 --> 29:16.255
We're not intubating, Sam.

29:16.288 --> 29:18.324
What are you doing?

29:18.357 --> 29:19.992
Hi, can you tell me
who's on call for
Ethics today, please?

29:20.026 --> 29:21.460
It's Larabee. I've discussed
this with him already.

29:21.493 --> 29:23.195
I'm not going to sit...
All right, stop, Sam!

29:23.229 --> 29:25.564
I'm the doctor.
This is my call.
You can either

29:25.597 --> 29:27.566
go mix his morphine drip
or you can take yourself

29:27.599 --> 29:29.068
off this case
because we're done here.

29:38.845 --> 29:40.012
LOCKHART:
Suction.

29:40.046 --> 29:41.180
She had headaches,
abdominal pain,

29:41.213 --> 29:42.148
rash, mood swings.

29:42.181 --> 29:44.016
Tube.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.885
Porphyria seemed to explain
all her unrelated complaints.

29:49.221 --> 29:50.857
Okay. I'm in.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.092
Pass me the bag.
Nice job, Abby.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.160
Yeah, Abby.

29:54.193 --> 29:55.962
Real nice job.

29:55.995 --> 29:58.297
You and your intern spent
eight hours working up a zebra

29:58.330 --> 30:00.466
without ruling out common causes
for acute abdominal pain.

30:00.499 --> 30:03.102
X-ray's back.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.004
(groans)
I got it.

30:05.037 --> 30:07.506
Free air under the diaphragm,
probably a perfed ulcer.

30:07.539 --> 30:09.508
Yeah, right,
which might not be perfed

30:09.541 --> 30:11.510
if you had diagnosed this
four hours ago.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.381
RASGOTRA:
OR 3 is ready.

30:15.414 --> 30:17.950
Haleh will help you
get her upstairs.

30:17.984 --> 30:20.920
All right, that's it, you two.
Okay, I got this.

30:20.953 --> 30:21.587
Sat's coming up.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.055
What's her access?

30:23.089 --> 30:25.124
Did you guys send coags?

30:27.359 --> 30:28.928
I'm sorry.

30:28.961 --> 30:30.229
I went down
the wrong path.

30:30.262 --> 30:31.630
You got excited
about your hypothesis.

30:31.663 --> 30:34.000
It's fine.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.501
It's good.

30:35.534 --> 30:36.869
This is my fault.

30:36.903 --> 30:38.204
I'm supposed to know better.

30:42.474 --> 30:45.945
Excuse me, I'm here
to pick up Heather Baker.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.179
Are you family?

30:47.213 --> 30:49.181
I oversee
the Chicago property.

30:49.215 --> 30:50.516
I have a letter
from her father,

30:50.549 --> 30:52.151
which allows you
to release her to me.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.422
Well, I don't know where she is,

30:56.455 --> 30:58.090
and I'm kind of busy,
so you're going to have to wait.

30:58.124 --> 31:00.359
Well, I've been waiting
almost an hour.

31:00.392 --> 31:03.930
Sorry.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.097
Sam, I have a kid
in 4 who needs

31:05.131 --> 31:07.666
the wax cleaned
out of his ear.

31:07.699 --> 31:10.169
I'm a little tied up right now.
And I'd appreciate it

31:10.202 --> 31:12.571
if you could pull up the
troponins for our rule-out MI.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.640
I don't have a password
for the lab computer yet.

31:38.364 --> 31:41.233
Lily, take this to Gates.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.057
Heather!

32:06.592 --> 32:12.698
Don't! Heather, stop!

32:17.103 --> 32:17.736
No, I don't want this!

32:17.769 --> 32:18.704
Hold still, Heather.

32:18.737 --> 32:19.705
You're making this harder.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.373
Hypoxia makes people combative.

32:21.407 --> 32:24.043
She was here all alone
all night with vague complaints.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.177
None of us wondered why.

32:25.211 --> 32:26.212
She kept changing
her story.

32:26.245 --> 32:27.313
She's calming down.

32:27.346 --> 32:28.614
Well, that's the
Valium overdose.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.016
Next, she's going
to stop breathing.

32:30.016 --> 32:31.350
TAGGART:
18 gauge
in the antecube.

32:31.383 --> 32:33.219
All right, go ahead
and give the flumazenil.

32:33.252 --> 32:34.453
I totally
missed it again.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.588
Oh, I saw it, too.
I blew her off.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.557
LOCKHART:
Big occipital lac
back here.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.026
TAGGART:
I knocked her down
pretty hard.

32:40.059 --> 32:41.560
She cracked her head
on the platform.

32:41.593 --> 32:44.030
Page Psych. They need
to come and see her. NG's in.

32:44.030 --> 32:45.197
Tape?

32:45.231 --> 32:46.565
PRATT:
Placement's good.
Charcoal.

32:46.598 --> 32:48.467
GRADY:
50 grams.
Right.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.568
(sighs)

32:49.601 --> 32:53.205
PRATT:
Here it goes.

32:53.239 --> 32:54.740
TAGGART:
I should have seen it.

32:54.773 --> 32:56.208
I thought she was playing games.
I should have seen it.

32:56.242 --> 32:57.476
You saved her life, Sam.

32:57.509 --> 33:00.146
Don't be too hard on yourself.

33:03.215 --> 33:04.516
Hey.

33:04.550 --> 33:06.052
Hey.

33:08.554 --> 33:10.056
Thank you.

33:10.689 --> 33:12.324
(Pratt sighs)

33:12.358 --> 33:13.792
What can I say?

33:13.825 --> 33:17.496
I overreacted
about the ulcer.

33:17.529 --> 33:18.330
No, you didn't.

33:18.364 --> 33:19.498
Happens to everyone.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.167
And she did great
in the OR.

33:26.138 --> 33:29.208
How do people do this?

33:29.241 --> 33:31.510
Working with interns
is always tricky.

33:31.543 --> 33:35.514
It's hard to supervise
without micromanaging.

33:35.547 --> 33:38.750
It's not just interns.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.786
It's everything.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.758
Some guy shoved me
on the El today,

33:46.792 --> 33:48.160
and I lost it.

33:48.194 --> 33:49.695
I followed him off
the train screaming

33:49.728 --> 33:51.397
even though
it wasn't my stop.

33:51.430 --> 33:54.666
I also fired the nanny,
which is totally irrational,

33:54.700 --> 33:56.568
because Joe's fall had nothing
to do with her,

33:56.602 --> 33:58.704
but I couldn't look at her
without thinking about it.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.506
Oh, that's
understandable.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.608
No, it's not.

34:02.641 --> 34:04.343
It's...

34:04.376 --> 34:09.481
It's like I'm actually trying
to screw things up.

34:09.514 --> 34:10.849
You know, it sounds like
you need a day off.

34:10.882 --> 34:15.286
I wish... it were that simple.

34:17.123 --> 34:19.425
Is there anything I can do?

34:25.597 --> 34:29.835
Do you mind
if I sign out a little early?

34:29.868 --> 34:32.138
(exhales loudly)

34:33.405 --> 34:34.706
Sure.

34:34.739 --> 34:37.443
Thanks.

34:40.779 --> 34:41.780
GRADY:
I finished the brow lac

34:41.813 --> 34:43.149
on the carpenter.

34:43.181 --> 34:44.616
Wow, that was fast.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.385
Didn't need
a two-layer closure?

34:46.418 --> 34:48.187
Actually, Dr. Morris
just had me dermabond it.

34:48.219 --> 34:49.554
Oh, okay.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.822
And how's our
gastroenteritis girl doing?

34:51.857 --> 34:53.659
Is she keeping
Gatorade down?

34:53.692 --> 34:56.262
Well, I-I didn't really
end up pushing fluids because

34:56.295 --> 34:59.198
Dr. Morris said to just go
ahead with the bolus, so...

34:59.231 --> 35:01.867
And I saw Ortho was down here
reducing that shoulder.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.669
How much ketamine
did you need?

35:03.702 --> 35:06.205
I ended up using propofol
because Dr. Morris...

35:06.238 --> 35:08.240
Well, he decided
that he wasn't...

35:10.576 --> 35:11.777
(knocking)

35:11.810 --> 35:12.644
SKYE:
Morris?

35:12.678 --> 35:15.347
What? What? Geez!

35:15.381 --> 35:16.882
I asked for Benadryl,
patient gets Atarax.

35:16.915 --> 35:19.351
I order a splint,
kid gets an Ace.

35:19.385 --> 35:21.420
What kind of creepy loser

35:21.453 --> 35:23.689
hangs out in the break room
all night second-guessing

35:23.722 --> 35:25.657
other attendings when
he's not even on the schedule?

35:25.691 --> 35:26.758
I don't know
if I'm being punk'd

35:26.792 --> 35:28.460
or if you haze
all new attendings

35:28.494 --> 35:31.230
this way, but I don't need you
double-checking my work.

35:31.263 --> 35:33.199
I-I wasn't.
The only reason
I am here is

35:33.232 --> 35:34.600
to make some extra cash
for a surf trip.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.235
Come December,
I am gone.

35:36.268 --> 35:37.636
So you can
stop worrying

35:37.669 --> 35:39.905
that I'm after your job
or your promotion

35:39.938 --> 35:42.208
or whatever you
and your micropenis

35:42.241 --> 35:43.475
are so afraid of.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.446
Oh!

35:47.479 --> 35:49.381
Hi. Archie Morris.

35:49.415 --> 35:51.917
I have no idea who you are
or what you're talking about.

35:51.950 --> 35:54.586
Got to bounce.
You good?

35:54.620 --> 35:55.654
(sighs)

36:01.260 --> 36:02.228
TAGGART:
Hey.

36:02.261 --> 36:04.263
You're okay.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.332
We got rid of all
the pills you took.

36:08.634 --> 36:11.537
Heather, we didn't take very
good care of you last night.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.839
I'm sorry for that.

36:16.275 --> 36:18.277
Your dad's on a plane.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.312
He'll be here
in about an hour.

36:22.314 --> 36:25.251
Is Elizabitch coming, too?

36:25.251 --> 36:26.252
Who?

36:27.953 --> 36:29.921
(voice breaking):
His wife.

36:29.955 --> 36:32.291
He married her
after my mom died.

36:32.324 --> 36:35.327
Eight months
after my mom died.

36:37.329 --> 36:38.764
(sobbing)

36:38.797 --> 36:41.633
She convinced him to move
to New York and leave me here.

36:41.667 --> 36:44.903
What do you mean,
leave you here?

36:44.936 --> 36:45.937
(inhales deeply)

36:45.971 --> 36:48.340
She didn't want a stepkid.

36:50.309 --> 36:53.779
So, he visits...

36:53.812 --> 36:56.648
takes me out to lunch
and buys me things.

36:58.384 --> 37:01.320
But mainly, he just pays people
to tend to me,

37:01.353 --> 37:04.290
like I am
a high-maintenance garden.

37:09.795 --> 37:12.431
Why did you do it?

37:12.464 --> 37:13.965
Why did you save me?

37:13.999 --> 37:14.866
Heather...

37:14.900 --> 37:17.002
I wanted to die.

37:23.375 --> 37:26.978
(softly):
Things will get better, I swear.

37:43.362 --> 37:44.896
(Pratt sighs)

37:44.930 --> 37:46.998
Don't you have to
get out of here?

37:47.032 --> 37:49.335
Yeah, well, it doesn't
start for another hour.

37:49.368 --> 37:50.769
I can't believe

37:50.802 --> 37:52.904
you worked the overnight
before the boards.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.540
After a few years
of getting no sleep,

37:54.573 --> 37:56.508
you get used to it.

37:56.542 --> 37:59.044
Oh. Uh, not me.

37:59.077 --> 38:00.446
I don't think
I'll ever get used to it.

38:00.479 --> 38:01.513
I hate working nights.

38:01.547 --> 38:02.414
Always have.

38:02.448 --> 38:04.416
Here.

38:04.450 --> 38:05.351
Good luck today.

38:05.351 --> 38:07.853
Thanks.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.988
(sighs)

38:22.668 --> 38:24.970
(chuckles softly)

38:34.680 --> 38:36.682
He's unconscious
and bradycardic,

38:36.715 --> 38:39.585
but he's still
breathing, so...

38:39.618 --> 38:40.819
Could be a while
before he actually...

38:40.852 --> 38:43.722
Yeah, I-I... I get it.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.757
His mom's in shock.

38:45.791 --> 38:47.693
I don't think
she was expecting this.

38:47.726 --> 38:49.428
But she knew that
he had a fatal, progressive...

38:49.461 --> 38:50.596
I mean today.

38:50.629 --> 38:53.932
She wasn't expecting
this today.

38:53.965 --> 38:56.635
She thought they
had more time.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.470
Of course she did.

38:58.504 --> 39:00.506
(inhales deeply)

39:04.075 --> 39:07.646
Serena, this is, uh, Julia.

39:07.679 --> 39:08.814
She's a chaplain here.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.752
Chaplain?

39:13.785 --> 39:15.421
Yeah.

39:15.454 --> 39:17.423
I'm so sorry.

39:17.456 --> 39:19.458
(labored breathing)

39:29.835 --> 39:32.604
I can't do this.

39:32.638 --> 39:34.640
It's not the natural
order of things.

39:41.112 --> 39:44.616
Do you want to say a prayer?

39:44.650 --> 39:45.551
No.

39:45.584 --> 39:46.618
Okay.

39:49.955 --> 39:52.023
Do you want me to say a prayer?

39:52.057 --> 39:53.959
(voice breaking):
No.

39:53.992 --> 39:55.994
(labored breathing)

40:19.985 --> 40:22.020
(labored breathing)

40:53.118 --> 40:54.620
(El squealing and rumbling)

40:56.287 --> 40:58.690

41:23.915 --> 41:26.552

41:55.947 --> 41:58.584
