00:03.177 --> 00:04.569
Here's to the sale
of our flip house.

00:04.613 --> 00:07.224
Much like me, it looks
good on the outside,

00:07.268 --> 00:09.096
but it has a
questionable foundation.

00:09.139 --> 00:10.358
[laughter]Cheers.

00:10.401 --> 00:12.360
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
don't jinx this thing.

00:12.403 --> 00:14.101
The buyers can still
back out until

00:14.144 --> 00:16.581
the end of business today,
which is in...

00:16.625 --> 00:19.149
four... three...

00:19.193 --> 00:20.759
Too late, suckers![laughter]

00:20.803 --> 00:22.065
Whoo!

00:22.109 --> 00:23.545
They're stuck with it!

00:23.588 --> 00:26.069
I mean, good for them.
It's a lovely home.

00:26.113 --> 00:29.246
All right, Don and I
have a big surprise.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.161
The house sold
for more than we expected.

00:31.205 --> 00:32.728
We're putting
most of the money aside

00:32.771 --> 00:34.208
to buy another flip, but...

00:34.251 --> 00:36.645
But there's enough left for
everyone to get a nice bonus.

00:36.688 --> 00:37.776
[gasping and oohing]

00:37.820 --> 00:39.778
I was gonna do
that part.

00:39.822 --> 00:41.171
Yeah, but I wanted to do it.

00:41.215 --> 00:43.869
Look how much
they like me now.

00:43.913 --> 00:47.047
All I ask is that you don't
do anything practical

00:47.090 --> 00:49.136
with the money.
Reward yourselves.

00:49.179 --> 00:51.138
Like, Don and I are
using our bonuses

00:51.181 --> 00:53.401
to celebrate my 50th
birthday Burns style.

00:53.444 --> 00:54.619
Ah...![laughs]

00:54.663 --> 00:56.969
Whatever it is, I'm in.

00:57.013 --> 00:58.188
We're doing a week-long
dirt bike ride

00:58.232 --> 01:00.103
in Colorado down
a gnarly trail

01:00.147 --> 01:01.626
called the
Devil's Tailpipe.

01:01.670 --> 01:04.716
I'm out.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.328
But I'd be back in
if you wanted to go

01:07.371 --> 01:09.852
to the lake and paddle
around in a swan boat?

01:09.895 --> 01:12.811
Burns men don't do
swan boats, Lowell.

01:14.161 --> 01:16.554
You're just gonna have to
let that coupon expire.

01:18.165 --> 01:20.950
Sweetie? I say
this with love.

01:20.993 --> 01:22.604
But, um, you're
turning 50.

01:22.647 --> 01:24.649
I think the window
may have closed on you

01:24.693 --> 01:26.608
riding a motorcycle
down Satan's Butt Crack.

01:28.697 --> 01:30.655
Devil's Tailpipe.

01:30.699 --> 01:33.049
Wow. 50, huh?

01:33.093 --> 01:34.137
[chuckles]

01:34.181 --> 01:36.357
That means you were 16
when I was born.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.273
You could've driven my mother
to the hospital to have me.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.189
No more old jokes.
Got it.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.843
Okay, look,

01:44.887 --> 01:46.845
I have only
ever had two things

01:46.889 --> 01:49.152
on my bucket list:
the Devil's Tailpipe

01:49.196 --> 01:51.154
and Angelina Jolie.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.200
Angelina's just a lady
with a bunch of kids now,

01:53.243 --> 01:55.158
[chuckles]: and I already
have one of those.

01:56.290 --> 01:58.422
I just don't want
you to get hurt.

01:58.466 --> 02:01.251
Well, I...What do you think about
Don going on this trip?

02:01.295 --> 02:02.731
I don't like it.

02:02.774 --> 02:04.167
Hey, best-case scenario,

02:04.211 --> 02:06.126
I come home
reenergized and happy.

02:06.169 --> 02:08.693
Worst-case scenario, my
life insurance is paid

02:08.737 --> 02:10.042
and you're rich.

02:11.305 --> 02:13.263
Okay, I'm coming around.

02:16.962 --> 02:18.486
Okay, it's time
to open presents.

02:18.529 --> 02:20.183
Look at all these gifts.

02:20.227 --> 02:22.098
You told me people were
just bringing best wishes.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.493
Happy birthday,
little brother.

02:25.536 --> 02:27.973
I wish you the best.

02:28.017 --> 02:30.106
That's from
me and Marcy.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.761
All right, hey,
Mom and Dad.

02:32.804 --> 02:37.287
Thanks for...
whatever this is.

02:37.331 --> 02:38.941
It's a sock puller-upper.

02:39.811 --> 02:41.161
To help you put on your socks.

02:42.423 --> 02:43.772
Happy birthday, son.

02:43.815 --> 02:45.817
You've bent over
for the last time.

02:47.645 --> 02:51.127
I can put my own socks on.
I'm not old, I'm middle-aged.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.130
50 isn't middle-aged,
it's two-thirds aged.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.959
Happy birthday to you.

02:57.002 --> 02:59.179
Open mine.

02:59.222 --> 03:00.745
I love surprising people.

03:00.789 --> 03:02.704
It's a GoPro camera.
I couldn't wait.

03:04.358 --> 03:06.360
Andi got you a shirt.Lowell!

03:08.362 --> 03:12.279
This is cool! I could take
this to the Devil's Tailpipe!

03:12.322 --> 03:13.715
I can't believe you're
really doing that.

03:13.758 --> 03:16.283
Doing what?
What's the Devil's Tailpipe?

03:16.326 --> 03:19.460
Is it a sex club?
Oh, Adam.

03:19.503 --> 03:22.289
Yes, Ma, I'm going to
a sex club on my birthday.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.204
And I'm announcing it
in front of the whole family.

03:24.247 --> 03:25.292
You want to go?

03:26.684 --> 03:28.686
No, your son wants
to ride a motorcycle

03:28.730 --> 03:30.210
down the side
of a mountain.

03:30.253 --> 03:32.255
And he hasn't been on
a dirt bike in years.

03:32.299 --> 03:33.691
I'll be fine.

03:33.735 --> 03:36.128
You're only as old as you feel,
and I feel like a kid.

03:36.172 --> 03:37.260
This morning,
I put a banana

03:37.304 --> 03:39.262
between two oranges
at the breakfast table

03:39.306 --> 03:42.178
and I laughed for ten minutes.[laughter]

03:42.222 --> 03:45.312
I don't get it. What's funny
about a healthy breakfast?

03:46.443 --> 03:49.272
Look, Adam, you know
that, as you've aged,

03:49.316 --> 03:50.969
you've had to give
some things up.

03:51.013 --> 03:53.842
Even things you love.
Remember sauerkraut?

03:53.885 --> 03:56.105
I did love sauerkraut.Mm-hmm.

03:56.148 --> 03:57.802
I miss it every damn day.

03:59.195 --> 04:02.242
But sauerkraut has hurt way
more people than motorcycles.

04:03.286 --> 04:04.418
Let him go, Andi.

04:04.461 --> 04:05.723
Believe me.

04:05.767 --> 04:08.204
A day will come when
all your husband wants to do

04:08.248 --> 04:11.207
is just sit on the couch.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.601
Where do you want
me to go, Bev?
I don't know.

04:13.644 --> 04:15.298
How about a nice nature walk?

04:15.342 --> 04:17.213
I've already taken
a nice nature walk.

from the X-ray,

something."

10:13.569 --> 10:15.266
Oh, hey, Joe.
How's Adam?

10:15.310 --> 10:17.529
[groans]

10:17.573 --> 10:20.620
[chuckles] That's some fancy
lingerie, little brother.

10:21.925 --> 10:23.187
Dad, are you okay?

10:23.231 --> 10:24.928
And if you are,
help us.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.497
Uh, kids, why don't you
go get changed.[sighs]

10:28.540 --> 10:30.891
So? How was the doctor?

10:30.934 --> 10:33.371
The motorcycle trip's off.
He said I can't go.

10:33.415 --> 10:35.939
I've been diagnosed
with excessive oldness.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.114
Yeah.

10:37.158 --> 10:38.507
But on the way out,
the nurse told me

10:38.550 --> 10:40.596
I'm an inch shorter than
I used to be, so I got that.

10:41.553 --> 10:42.729
Well, then I should
double-check.

10:42.772 --> 10:44.513
You may not be tall enough
for the swan boat.

10:44.556 --> 10:48.386
We're not doing
the swan boat, Lowell.

10:48.430 --> 10:49.997
Honey, are-are you okay?I'm fine.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.520
What about me
doesn't seem fine?

10:51.563 --> 10:53.957
Pretty much the
whole package.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.829
Well, I guess you were right.

10:55.872 --> 10:58.135
It's time to act my age,
so from now on,

10:58.179 --> 11:00.572
this couch is where
I will be living.

11:00.616 --> 11:01.835
With my dad.

11:01.878 --> 11:03.010
Well, hold on,
hold on.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.402
You're-you're not
that age, either.

11:04.446 --> 11:06.056
[chuckles]
I'm not 20 anymore.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.405
Yeah, but you're not 70.

11:07.449 --> 11:08.929
I am if you round up.

11:08.972 --> 11:09.973
Oh...

11:10.017 --> 11:11.801
I can't even
put on my own socks.

11:11.845 --> 11:15.892
[chuckles, groans]

11:15.936 --> 11:17.198
[sighs]:
Oh, that's nice.

11:17.241 --> 11:19.026
Welcome to the
promised land, boy.

11:19.069 --> 11:22.029
[both laugh]

11:22.072 --> 11:23.987
BOTH:
Yeah...

11:24.901 --> 11:27.251
Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

11:27.295 --> 11:30.559
Yeah. I'm married to Joe.

11:30.602 --> 11:33.997
[both laugh, sigh]

11:40.525 --> 11:42.136
TV REPORTER: New England is
enjoying a warm spell,

11:42.179 --> 11:44.138
but a low pressure system
is moving in.

11:44.181 --> 11:46.357
There's a twist
I did not see coming.

11:46.401 --> 11:49.709
Hmm. Low pressure's
a sneaky bastard.

11:49.752 --> 11:53.190
Okay, I think it's time
to get off the couch.

11:53.234 --> 11:54.757
Okay? It's been a week.

11:54.801 --> 11:57.978
Wha-- I would remind you,
I have a back injury.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.762
I can't get up now;
this weather lady's

11:59.806 --> 12:02.547
about to stick a ruler
in the snow.

12:02.591 --> 12:05.376
Ah, Joe, there you are.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.814
Let's go. You promised
we'd take a walk in the park.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.511
Man, she's sneaky.

12:09.554 --> 12:11.600
Your mother's a damn
low pressure system.

12:11.643 --> 12:13.863
[both chuckle]

12:13.907 --> 12:15.473
A walk is the least you can do

12:15.517 --> 12:17.084
since you won't exercise
with me at my gym.

12:17.127 --> 12:19.173
You just want to parade
me around that gym

12:19.216 --> 12:21.262
in front of your gal pals
like a show pony.

12:21.305 --> 12:23.438
Well, now I can
parade you

12:23.481 --> 12:25.788
in front of my gal pals
at the park.

12:25.832 --> 12:28.573
At this point, I just hope
a hawk flies off with me.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.623
Oh, what's this?

12:34.666 --> 12:39.323
[gasps] Why, it's the stretching
exercises the doctor gave you.

12:39.367 --> 12:42.805
Exercise number one: get up.

12:42.849 --> 12:46.983
Hey, you need
to embrace my new lifestyle.

12:47.027 --> 12:48.680
Hey, you always wanted a cat.

12:48.724 --> 12:50.030
Think of me as a cat

12:50.073 --> 12:52.075
that can tell you
the weather.

12:54.730 --> 12:57.820
Hey, how about this?Hmm.

12:57.864 --> 13:01.781
Maybe we go upstairs
and fool around.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.826
That's your
favorite exercise.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.568
[chuckles] I don't think I'll be
doing much of that anymore.

13:06.611 --> 13:10.006
Everything is connected
to the back. Even the front.

13:10.050 --> 13:13.096
All right.
That's it.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.838
Adam, I want you to go
on this motorcycle trip.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.841
What?If you do the stretches
that the doctor gave you

13:18.885 --> 13:21.801
and your back gets better,
I am fine with it.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.585
I thought you were worried
I'd get hurt.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.413
Yeah, well, now I'm more worried
about your mind

13:25.456 --> 13:26.936
than I am your body.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.633
You just turned down
daytime sex.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.592
I mean, usually,
if I just stop moving,

13:30.635 --> 13:32.246
you take it as a go sign.

13:32.289 --> 13:33.987
Not true.

13:34.030 --> 13:36.206
I pretty much leave you alone
when you're sleeping.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.165
I want my husband back.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.210
You are Adam Burns. Okay?

13:40.254 --> 13:43.605
The man who, last Fourth of
July, forgot to put on sunscreen

13:43.648 --> 13:46.347
but still held his daughter
on his bright red shoulders

13:46.390 --> 13:48.392
so she could see the fireworks.

13:48.436 --> 13:49.872
[chuckles]:
Yeah. When she got down,

13:49.916 --> 13:51.395
it was like peeling off
two giant Band-Aids.

13:51.439 --> 13:52.657
Yeah, but you did it.

13:52.701 --> 13:53.920
You're damn right I did.

13:53.963 --> 13:55.704
You've never backed down before,

13:55.747 --> 13:59.229
and you are not gonna
back down now, so get up.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.231
I'm getting up!

14:01.275 --> 14:03.364
Get me up!

14:05.932 --> 14:07.498
And I'm gonna start
doing those exercises.

14:07.542 --> 14:08.848
Yeah, yeah,
you're not old.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.850
You're just aged,
like a good cheese.

14:10.893 --> 14:13.983
So get moving.

14:14.027 --> 14:16.986
♪ Where have

14:17.030 --> 14:19.902

Hey.

14:58.419 --> 14:59.942
Having a protein shake?

14:59.986 --> 15:00.900
Uh, chocolate shake.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.467
I've earned it.

15:03.511 --> 15:06.296
I put on my own socks today.

15:06.340 --> 15:08.298
I am so proud.

15:08.342 --> 15:09.865
Well, wait, it gets better.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.694
I also went to the doctor
and got a clean bill of health.

15:12.737 --> 15:16.002
Plus, a bill
for some stuff Dad stole.

15:16.045 --> 15:17.829
I'm riding
the Devil's Tailpipe, baby.

15:17.873 --> 15:20.310
I can't believe I'm this excited
about you doing something

15:20.354 --> 15:21.964
so insane.Ah, but it won't be.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.879
No. Don and I rented
a couple dirt bikes

15:23.923 --> 15:26.099
to train on so we'll be ready.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.840
If only you and Don had rented
a birthday cake to train on,

15:28.884 --> 15:30.538
none of this
would've happened.

15:32.235 --> 15:36.152
Yo. Ready to ride?

15:37.980 --> 15:39.155
We're just going
around the block.

15:39.199 --> 15:40.809
Why are you dressed
like a Power Ranger?

15:42.811 --> 15:45.596
Why are you dressed
like Bob the Builder?

15:47.555 --> 15:49.949
Okay, truce.

15:50.775 --> 15:53.169
Let's do this.Yeah.

15:53.213 --> 15:55.128
I'm back!
[laughs]

15:57.521 --> 15:59.001
My back!

15:59.045 --> 16:01.786
Are you okay?

16:01.830 --> 16:03.440
D-Did you crash?

16:03.484 --> 16:04.746
I turned my head
to change lanes.

16:04.789 --> 16:05.834
And then you crashed?

16:05.877 --> 16:07.792
No, but I felt
my back tighten up.

16:07.836 --> 16:09.838
And then you crashed?No, there was no crash!

16:09.881 --> 16:13.146
I turned my head
and threw my back out.

16:13.189 --> 16:14.799
It was the birthday cake
all over again.

16:15.887 --> 16:17.889
All of a sudden,
he slowed down.

16:17.933 --> 16:20.631
Kid on a tricycle blew by him,
then he just wobbled to a stop.

16:20.675 --> 16:21.676
It was hard to watch.

16:23.721 --> 16:27.508
I want to forget the bike trip
and never talk about it again.

16:27.551 --> 16:30.032
It's dead to me,
like sauerkraut!

16:31.729 --> 16:34.036
Adam, I'm so sorry.Well, what about me?

16:34.080 --> 16:36.256
I got to walk back
to get his bike.

16:36.299 --> 16:39.041
When you're in a suit like this
with no motorcycle under you,

16:39.085 --> 16:40.651
people say hurtful things.

16:45.743 --> 16:47.441
ANDI:
Here's your muscle rub

16:47.484 --> 16:50.183
and some aspirin.

16:50.226 --> 16:53.012
Or as your dad calls it, brunch.

16:54.230 --> 16:56.624
Thanks. Maybe that'll help
get me moving.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.278
[chuckles, grunts]

16:58.321 --> 16:59.583
I'm sorry, I can't get up.

16:59.627 --> 17:01.585
No, no, no, it's
okay. You rest.

17:01.629 --> 17:04.545
Okay? I-I'll refill
your water, okay?

17:04.588 --> 17:06.677
Whoa! Got it. [laughs]

17:10.203 --> 17:14.033
So... your back
seems fine, Adam.

17:16.339 --> 17:18.863
That-that muscle rub
is a miracle.

17:19.864 --> 17:22.432
It just had to be
in the same room with me.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.913
Ha. Heh. Huh.

17:24.956 --> 17:27.002
What's going on?

17:27.046 --> 17:29.178
Okay.

17:29.222 --> 17:32.834
I'm not hurt. I...

17:32.877 --> 17:34.053
I just got spooked.

17:34.096 --> 17:36.577
I haven't been
on a dirt bike in a long time,

17:36.620 --> 17:40.189
and they're really fast now;
it was like riding a rocket.

17:40.233 --> 17:44.628
And I started thinking, as
I accidentally jumped a ditch.

17:44.672 --> 17:47.544
I got kids at home.
If something happens to me,

17:47.588 --> 17:49.372
you'd have to raise them
on your own.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.635
And you'd just dress them up
funny all the time.

17:51.679 --> 17:55.248
I know you would,
and I can't do that to them.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.815
So you faked being hurt
so you wouldn't have to go.

17:57.859 --> 18:00.862
If I can hurt my back
blowing out candles,

18:00.905 --> 18:03.821
what is gonna happen to me
on the Devil's Tailpipe?

18:03.865 --> 18:08.652
And if Don's the only one there
to help me, I'll die.

18:08.696 --> 18:11.655
Yeah, I mean, the only thing
you're gonna get from him

18:11.699 --> 18:13.570
is his best wishes.
[scoffs]

18:13.614 --> 18:17.226
I... I hate
to admit it, but...

18:17.270 --> 18:19.663
I really am getting older.

18:19.707 --> 18:21.665
No! [gasps]

18:21.709 --> 18:23.232
You're the first one.

18:23.276 --> 18:25.669
[chuckles]:
All right, all right.

18:25.713 --> 18:28.063
Look, I'm just saying,
there comes a time

18:28.107 --> 18:32.285
when you have to give up
on some of your dreams.

18:32.328 --> 18:33.634
Well...

18:34.722 --> 18:36.027
Wait. You know,

18:36.071 --> 18:39.161
I did some research,
and there are other rides.

18:39.205 --> 18:41.903
You know, uh, maybe instead
of the Devil's Tailpipe,

18:41.946 --> 18:44.993
you could pick a
less intense trail,

18:45.036 --> 18:47.996
like Marshmallow Flats.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.911
See, there are pictures,

18:49.954 --> 18:52.696
and the guys riding
Marshmallow Flats, they...

18:52.740 --> 18:55.873
they look a lot more like you.

18:55.917 --> 18:59.747
I could ride the heck out
of Marshmallow Flats.

18:59.790 --> 19:03.838
Wha... Yeah, this
sounds really nice.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.709
There's a deli in the middle.

19:05.753 --> 19:08.669
Yeah. And-and a bed-and-
breakfast along the way.

19:08.712 --> 19:13.064
A soft bed would be nice
after a long day of riding.

19:13.108 --> 19:16.894
Yeah. See? It's all
about your perspective.

19:16.938 --> 19:19.419
A-And I haven't lost
my taste for danger.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.856
Okay? At that deli, I'm getting
sauerkraut on my Rueben.

19:21.899 --> 19:23.945
I'm doing it, Andi.
I can handle it.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.035
Absolutely.

19:27.078 --> 19:30.038
You'll pack Tums.I'll pack Tums.

19:30.081 --> 19:34.521
Because with age comes wisdom,
and with wisdom...

19:34.564 --> 19:36.914
[stammers]
Tums.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.829
Ooh.

19:45.749 --> 19:47.534
EMME:
My eyes are closed.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.797
TEDDY:
I was mid-sneeze.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.843
We look real cult-y, Mom.

19:52.887 --> 19:56.195
Well, I look great, and it's
my bonus, so it's going up.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.022
You know, if one of us
ever breaks the law,

19:58.066 --> 19:59.894
this is gonna be the picture
they put on the news.

19:59.937 --> 20:01.330
Ha!

20:01.374 --> 20:03.202
[door opens]

20:04.420 --> 20:05.595
[gasps]
You're back!

20:05.639 --> 20:06.683
Mm-hmm.And alive.

20:06.727 --> 20:08.903
[both laugh]Aw.

20:08.946 --> 20:10.861
How was Marshmallow Flats?

20:10.905 --> 20:12.776
Soft and flat. I loved it.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.778
Aw.
I don't want to brag,

20:14.822 --> 20:17.172
but I got told to slow down
at least five times.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.260
[chuckles]

20:21.829 --> 20:23.309
Why is he still
wearing his gear?

I don't think he knows
how to get out of it.Oh.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.791
[sighs]

20:27.835 --> 20:29.053
W-What happened to him?

20:29.097 --> 20:30.751
Did he crash?No.

20:30.794 --> 20:32.622
We just spent a lot
of time at that deli,

20:32.666 --> 20:34.407
and tough guy over there
wouldn't take the Tums.

20:34.450 --> 20:38.541
It burns.
Too much pastrami.

20:38.585 --> 20:41.109
Looks like he's gonna be riding
that Devil's Tailpipe after all.
