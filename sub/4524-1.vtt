<i>Hey, man, where are you?</i>

02:00.221 --> 02:01.854
<i>Still at Grand Central.</i>

02:01.856 --> 02:03.322
<i>She there?</i>

02:03.324 --> 02:05.591
<i>She's here.</i>

02:05.593 --> 02:08.794
<i>But she's with some guy.</i>

02:09.830 --> 02:12.564
<i>Sorry, man.</i>

02:12.566 --> 02:13.899
<i>You still coming?</i>

02:13.901 --> 02:15.467
<i>I don't know.</i>

02:15.469 --> 02:17.369
<i>Okay, well...</i>

02:17.371 --> 02:19.705
<i>I'm gonna text you
the address.</i>

02:19.707 --> 02:22.474
<i>I really hope you come.</i>

02:33.253 --> 02:35.787
Oh, shit!

02:35.789 --> 02:37.322
Excuse me!

02:37.324 --> 02:39.391
Excuse me!

02:49.537 --> 02:51.803
No, no, no, no, no, no!

03:15.228 --> 03:16.261
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

03:16.263 --> 03:17.429
Thought you might
want that back.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.798
- Thank you.
- I think it's broken.

03:20.266 --> 03:22.768
- Thank you very much.
- Sure.

03:22.902 --> 03:25.904
Due to Port
Authority Security regulations,

03:25.906 --> 03:27.773
the station is now closing.

03:27.775 --> 03:30.442
It will reopen at 5:30 a.m.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.543
Um... excuse me,

03:31.545 --> 03:35.314
um, what does that mean,
that "the station is closing"?

03:35.316 --> 03:36.648
That means you gotta leave.

03:36.650 --> 03:37.783
No trains till the morning.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.485
But I can't
wait that long, um...

03:40.487 --> 03:42.321
There's a line
for cabs out front.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.388
Okay, but I don't need a cab

03:43.390 --> 03:44.389
because I missed my train, um...

03:44.391 --> 03:45.791
The station doors

03:45.793 --> 03:46.792
will close in five minutes.

03:46.794 --> 03:49.394
Can I use this ticket
at another station?

03:49.396 --> 03:50.462
It won't help.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.931
Penn Station's closing, too.

04:32.705 --> 04:33.772
You sure you're okay?

04:33.774 --> 04:36.675
I'm o... I'm okay.

04:39.579 --> 04:42.814
Can I ask why
you're standing outside?

04:44.484 --> 04:46.752
They closed the station.

04:47.053 --> 04:50.389
You planning on
standing out here all night?

04:50.391 --> 04:52.424
My purse was stolen.

04:52.426 --> 04:53.525
Oh, damn.

04:53.527 --> 04:56.361
Yeah, I was in some bar,
so, now, all I have

04:56.363 --> 04:59.564
is this $13 train ticket
and my broken phone.

04:59.566 --> 05:00.799
Shit.

05:00.801 --> 05:01.433
Sorry.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.835
It's okay.
I'll figure something out.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.071
I don't need your pity.

05:06.073 --> 05:08.707
Well, I wasn't gonna offer pity.

05:08.709 --> 05:11.510
I was gonna offer
to split a cab.

05:11.944 --> 05:12.878
You can't help me.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.346
No, come on,
let me do a nice thing.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.948
You got your purse stolen,
I got like...

05:16.950 --> 05:19.084
80 bucks, give or take.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.018
How far you going?

05:20.020 --> 05:22.421
Boston, give or take.

05:23.623 --> 05:26.391
So, north of Harlem.

05:26.693 --> 05:28.527
All right. Hang on.

05:28.961 --> 05:30.395
Excuse me.

05:30.397 --> 05:32.064
Hey. See this lady?

05:32.066 --> 05:34.333
She's got to get to Boston
in a big hurry.

05:34.335 --> 05:35.400
No. New Haven.

05:35.402 --> 05:36.001
New Haven.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.569
New Haven...
And she got her purse stolen.

05:37.571 --> 05:38.737
It's an emergency.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.072
When you get her home
to New Haven,

05:40.074 --> 05:41.340
she'll cut you a big check.

05:41.342 --> 05:42.407
You know what you're saying?

05:42.409 --> 05:43.742
Drive all night,
half the morning.

05:43.744 --> 05:44.710
I know.
Come on, man.

05:44.712 --> 05:47.446
You see how she's dressed?
What kind of purse was it?

05:47.448 --> 05:48.513
- Prada.
- It's Prada?

05:48.515 --> 05:49.948
Prada.
It was a Prada purse.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.717
She's good for it,
plus a big tip.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.386
It's gonna be over a grand.

05:54.554 --> 05:56.488
Get the... You serious?

05:56.490 --> 05:58.657
200 miles,
at $2.50 a mile, is $500.

05:58.659 --> 06:01.093
Times two,
because I'm deadheading back.

06:01.095 --> 06:03.061
- Add in your Mass Pike tolls, twice.
- All right.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.663
All right, all right, all right.

06:04.665 --> 06:05.364
I got it.

06:05.366 --> 06:06.431
And you want me to trust her?

06:06.433 --> 06:07.466
No, no, no, you can't pay.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.601
It's okay.
You'll send me a check tomorrow.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.670
How do you know
I'll send you a check?

06:11.672 --> 06:14.840
When have you not paid me back?

06:14.974 --> 06:16.074
Your card is declined.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.877
All right. It's all right.
Sometimes happens.

06:18.879 --> 06:22.114
I got another one.
I never use this one.

06:22.116 --> 06:24.950
Probably because it's expired.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.618
You can read and add...

06:26.620 --> 06:27.652
How are you a cab driver?

06:27.654 --> 06:29.588
Hey, look, asshole,
your girlfriend is stuck.

06:29.590 --> 06:34.092
No New York cabbie is licensed
to operate in Massachusetts.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.027
So no one
is gonna take the risk.

06:36.029 --> 06:36.928
All right. All right.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.464
You know what?
I can call a friend.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.436
It's embarrassing.

06:44.438 --> 06:45.103
It's dead.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.872
Oh, my God.

06:46.874 --> 06:49.508
Do you have anything
at all that works?

06:49.510 --> 06:50.642
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.177
I didn't realize I was
taking up all the space

06:52.179 --> 06:54.579
at the front of the line of guys
trying to help you.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.149
You know, there are other things
I could be doing,

06:57.151 --> 06:59.084
surprising as it may seem.

06:59.086 --> 06:59.718
Okay.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.820
Well, I'm sorry
for holding you up.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.189
Well, the feeling's mutual.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.728
Hey, honey, sorry I'm late.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.601
That happens,
just stare straight ahead,

07:49.603 --> 07:52.103
keep walking strong.

07:54.040 --> 07:57.142
- Thank you.
- Sure.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.210
I'm sorry about back there,

07:58.212 --> 08:01.079
'cause I was rude
and I shouldn't have been rude.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.180
It's okay.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.648
I get it.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.584
Shitty nights all around.

08:05.586 --> 08:06.585
Believe it or not, this morning,

08:06.587 --> 08:09.788
I actually had
working credit cards.

08:14.260 --> 08:15.494
So what do you want to do?

08:15.496 --> 08:19.231
You want to get
a hotel room or something?

08:19.233 --> 08:20.265
Excuse me?

08:20.267 --> 08:24.002
No, not, not...
Jesus.

08:24.004 --> 08:24.903
Not for us, for you.

08:24.905 --> 08:28.740
In case you don't have friends
in the city.

08:29.675 --> 08:33.178
I don't have friends in the city
and I don't have a cell phone.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.080
And then my I.D.
and my credit cards

08:35.082 --> 08:38.149
were in that purse,
so I am screwed.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.284
Okay.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.220
Want to go try
and find your purse?

08:42.222 --> 08:45.023
What, like the person who took
it is just gonna put it back?

08:45.025 --> 08:48.193
Well, no, but sometimes,
they just take the cash.

08:48.195 --> 08:48.960
Dump the purse.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.696
You check the trash barrels
at the bar?

08:51.698 --> 08:53.031
No. No.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.001
What bar?
You remember the name?

08:56.003 --> 08:59.538
Um... Yeah, it began
with an "L."

08:59.540 --> 09:00.639
Um...

09:00.641 --> 09:02.073
I-I can't remember.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.875
It was down... it was downtown.

09:03.877 --> 09:04.910
Downtown.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.879
Well, that's on my way.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.147
It's on your way?

09:09.149 --> 09:11.716
Want to come with me,
have a little adventure?

09:11.718 --> 09:13.318
Find your purse?

09:17.256 --> 09:18.757
Okay.

09:19.725 --> 09:20.725
Okay.

09:20.727 --> 09:21.860
Let's go.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.628
Where are you going?

09:23.630 --> 09:25.964
Downtown is south.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.065
Right.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.068
Downtown.

09:39.712 --> 09:40.812
I'm Nick, by the way.

09:40.814 --> 09:44.015
Oh, hey, I'm... I'm Carrie.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.283
Carrie.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.953
It's nice to meet you, Carrie.

09:56.128 --> 09:58.697
Anything?

09:58.699 --> 09:59.631
All right.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.600
I got an idea.

10:04.003 --> 10:08.173
Hasn't turned up, sorry to say.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.040
But you never know.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.275
Yeah, that's what
the police said.

10:10.277 --> 10:13.278
Funny, they're
usually so helpful.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.814
But then they told me about
these guys that will

10:15.816 --> 10:17.148
lift purses
out of certain places

10:17.150 --> 10:19.718
and that, sometimes,
the bartender

10:19.720 --> 10:21.019
knows something.

10:21.021 --> 10:24.823
I guess saying shit is easier
than doing actual police work.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.024
Right.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.292
Right, that's true.

10:27.294 --> 10:27.993
But, uh...

10:27.995 --> 10:30.295
I bet there'd be a pretty
handsome gratuity in it

10:30.297 --> 10:34.366
if, uh, something popped
into your brain.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.334
- Prada, you said?
- Uh-huh.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.136
It does have sentimental value

10:38.138 --> 10:41.840
and I would pay a lot
to get it back.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.744
Give me a sec.

10:47.747 --> 10:49.814
Sentimental value.
Nice touch.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.216
It's true.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.217
I appreciate you doing this.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.352
I know that you weren't planning
on spending your night

10:54.354 --> 10:58.890
rummaging through filthy
garbage bathroom trash cans.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.926
Well, I didn't plan <i> not</i> to.

11:01.928 --> 11:05.130
Well, what about all the other
things that you could be doing?

11:05.132 --> 11:10.201
Well, you didn't say trash can
treasure hunts were on the menu.

11:10.436 --> 11:14.205
I'm actually in town for
an audition... tomorrow.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.206
I was in Grand Central Station,

11:15.208 --> 11:19.944
just kinda... trying to piece
together what I want to play.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.713
So, trumpet?

11:21.715 --> 11:23.148
Yeah.

11:23.150 --> 11:26.084
I don't think that I've seen
anyone play trumpet

11:26.086 --> 11:27.086
since eighth grade band.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.887
Well, we're still around.

11:28.889 --> 11:32.691
We just don't, uh, march
as much as we used to.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.159
- Jazz.
- Yeah.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.394
- You listen?
- I like it. I like jazz.

11:36.396 --> 11:37.295
I-I don't know it.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.264
- I know "My Funny Valentine."
- A classic.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.965
I actually did it one year
at summer camp.

11:40.967 --> 11:45.203
I serenaded Jonathan Weinstein
from behind a tree.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.706
Jonathan Weinstein
behind a tree.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.774
What was your encore?

11:49.776 --> 11:50.942
A strip tease to...

11:54.715 --> 11:55.947
Oh, wow. Brave.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.048
So embarrassing!

11:57.050 --> 11:58.016
Brave!

11:58.018 --> 11:58.783
He ran away.

11:58.785 --> 12:02.220
And... that was the end
of my jazz career.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.354
Yeah.

12:03.356 --> 12:04.823
Well, that's a shame.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.157
What was the next career?

12:06.159 --> 12:08.193
- I'm an art consultant.
- Really?

12:08.195 --> 12:11.096
I'm actually in the city
buying a painting.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.430
Oh, yeah? What's the piece?

12:12.432 --> 12:15.433
I don't know if you'd know it.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.736
Well, that's probably true.

12:17.738 --> 12:21.339
Um... who's
your favorite painter?

12:21.341 --> 12:22.974
Or would I not know him,
either?

12:22.976 --> 12:24.943
No, no.
But if I did tell you that,

12:24.945 --> 12:26.044
I'd lose all credibility.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.747
Oh, come on! You got to now.

12:28.749 --> 12:31.316
You're stupid.

12:31.318 --> 12:33.318
Well...

12:33.320 --> 12:34.819
we may be in luck.

12:34.821 --> 12:37.055
Took a little persuasion.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.491
Had to call in a favor or two.

12:39.493 --> 12:41.226
So, I just have to go
to this address and...?

12:41.228 --> 12:43.995
- That's a shitty neighborhood.
- What, you think, uh,

12:43.997 --> 12:47.165
guys on Wall Street
were lifting purses?

12:47.167 --> 12:49.067
Well...

12:49.069 --> 12:51.202
thank you.

12:51.204 --> 12:54.973
I hope I was helpful.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.442
Extremely.

12:57.444 --> 13:01.846
I think that he wants gratitude.

13:01.848 --> 13:04.349
Group hug?

13:04.351 --> 13:05.049
Big kiss?

13:05.051 --> 13:08.319
I believe the words were
"handsome gratuity."

13:08.321 --> 13:11.156
Right.

13:11.524 --> 13:14.793
You take credit cards?

13:14.795 --> 13:19.230
Okay, so it's-it's
this way, right?

13:19.465 --> 13:22.300
All right, you talked me
into it... I'm coming with you.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.969
Thank you, but really,
you have your thing and...

13:24.971 --> 13:26.104
It's all right. It's late.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.806
You're going
to a shitty neighborhood.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.440
I'm not gonna let you go alone.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.209
Besides, it's this way.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.944
Are you sure you don't mind?

13:32.946 --> 13:35.513
Positive. Come on.

13:37.316 --> 13:40.218
I'm sure that my husband
will really appreciate

13:40.220 --> 13:41.386
your helping me.

13:41.388 --> 13:44.889
It's incredibly generous of you.

13:44.891 --> 13:47.091
You didn't have to do that.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.093
What?

13:48.094 --> 13:48.960
The husband thing.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.862
Well, I didn't mean
to distrust you.

13:50.864 --> 13:54.566
It's just you're being so nice.

13:54.568 --> 13:56.568
Nice.

13:56.570 --> 13:59.470
Well... don't mention it.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.942
So, what was this thing that
you were headed to tonight?

14:03.944 --> 14:07.445
Is it something to do
with the audition or...?

14:07.447 --> 14:09.113
No, not really.

14:09.115 --> 14:11.249
Well, kind of.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.518
You know...

14:13.520 --> 14:16.221
you know when you can't
make up your mind

14:16.223 --> 14:18.022
about whether or not
you should do something?

14:18.024 --> 14:22.493
And you ask the universe
"If I'm supposed to do this,

14:22.495 --> 14:24.262
give me a sign"?

14:24.264 --> 14:27.432
And is the audition
the thing or the sign?

14:27.434 --> 14:28.533
The sign.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.903
There's this really
influential band...

14:31.905 --> 14:32.971
Duke Terry?

14:32.973 --> 14:34.372
- No...
- It's all right.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.875
He's this amazing piano player.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.043
Lost his trumpet player
about a month ago

14:39.045 --> 14:44.015
and I love the guy's music
and I thought... why not?

14:45.317 --> 14:46.885
And... the thing?

14:46.887 --> 14:49.654
- "The thing"?
- The thing that you needed the sign...

14:49.656 --> 14:52.023
Oh, the thing! Right, right.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.559
That's, uh...

14:54.561 --> 14:56.027
a wedding.

14:56.029 --> 14:59.130
Are you gonna
break up a wedding?

14:59.132 --> 15:00.965
No.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.267
No, it's complicated.

15:02.269 --> 15:05.169
There's just someone
I wanted to see.

15:05.171 --> 15:07.272
The bride?

15:07.274 --> 15:09.207
Nope.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.541
The groom?

15:11.978 --> 15:14.379
No.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.413
But what about you?

15:15.415 --> 15:19.217
I'm guessing the purse was
the gift from your husband?

15:19.219 --> 15:23.655
Think you might be
missing some hardware.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.927
I have a ring,
but I'm not wearing it

15:28.929 --> 15:31.396
because it's being repaired
back in Boston.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.698
Okay. Whatever you say.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.167
You don't believe me?

15:36.169 --> 15:39.637
It's none of my business.

16:05.564 --> 16:08.132
All right, this is it.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.201
Jesus. You know what?

16:10.203 --> 16:10.735
Let me do this.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.971
What'd you say it was...
A black Prada bag?

16:12.973 --> 16:14.339
I think we should
call the police.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.307
Yeah. They'll be right over.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.742
How's next Thursday?

16:17.744 --> 16:19.544
Anything specific about the bag?

16:19.546 --> 16:22.447
Yeah.
On the inside flap

16:22.449 --> 16:26.417
are the initials B.D.
in kid's handwriting.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.519
"B.D." Why B.D.?

16:28.521 --> 16:31.422
My stepson wrote it.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.224
My name is Brooke.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.559
Brooke Dalton.

16:34.561 --> 16:35.994
Oh, my God!

16:35.996 --> 16:37.595
Why'd you tell me it was Carrie?

16:37.597 --> 16:38.763
I don't know!
Carrie Bradshaw!

16:38.765 --> 16:42.400
We're in New York, it's late,
you're a stranger... I froze.

16:42.402 --> 16:43.301
Well, when I get back,

16:43.303 --> 16:45.536
we really got to work
on our communication, Brooke.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.338
Two blocks that way,
there's a bar

16:47.340 --> 16:49.507
called Gaffney's...
Wait for me there, all right?

16:49.509 --> 16:51.709
Wait! How much cash do you have?

16:51.711 --> 16:53.011
I don't know.

16:53.013 --> 16:55.013
That's a personal question.

16:55.015 --> 16:55.780
Maybe 40 bucks?

16:55.782 --> 16:57.648
You're gonna do something crazy.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.351
Thank you for not saying
"stupid."

17:00.353 --> 17:01.185
That means a lot.

17:01.187 --> 17:04.088
You're gonna grab it
and run, aren't you?

17:04.089 --> 17:05.089
Uh... I don't know.

17:05.090 --> 17:07.692
It's exciting, though, isn't it?

17:07.694 --> 17:10.161
Go.

17:23.809 --> 17:26.176
You the one lost the purse?

17:26.179 --> 17:31.149
Yeah, and without it,
my whole outfit falls apart.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.598
<i>Hello, Four Seasons Atlanta.</i>

17:47.600 --> 17:51.536
<i>Uh, Michael Dalton's
room, please.</i>

17:51.538 --> 17:54.639
One moment, please.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.140
Hello?

17:56.142 --> 17:57.575
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.709
What's going on?
You okay?

17:58.711 --> 18:00.278
Yeah, I'm okay.
I just couldn't sleep.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.815
And I, I just wanted
to tell you that I love you.

18:03.817 --> 18:06.350
Oh, honey, I love you, too.

18:06.352 --> 18:07.452
How's New York?

18:07.454 --> 18:09.087
Did you make the buy?

18:09.089 --> 18:11.255
Yeah, I made the buy.

18:11.257 --> 18:11.756
For 225.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.125
Yeah.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.193
It's been going on so long.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.261
I'm just glad it finally closed,
you know?

18:17.263 --> 18:18.596
Yeah, right. Of course.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.131
Well, congratulations.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.399
Did you get my message?

18:21.401 --> 18:23.868
No. What?
My phone actually broke.

18:23.870 --> 18:24.569
Oh, shit.

18:24.571 --> 18:27.105
I was wondering
why you called the hotel.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.874
Well, there's
a little change of plans.

18:29.876 --> 18:32.643
And I'm gonna be
on the first flight out.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.278
So I'll be home by 8:00
and we can have

18:34.280 --> 18:36.380
a little, uh,
celebration breakfast?

18:36.382 --> 18:38.249
That's so early.
It's 2:00 a.m.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.684
Don't you just want to relax?

18:39.686 --> 18:40.785
Weren't you on a later flight?

18:40.787 --> 18:43.121
No, it's all right.
I can sleep on the plane.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.256
I don't want to stay here
any longer than I have to.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.424
<i>Baby, you work so hard.</i>

18:46.426 --> 18:48.259
<i>Why don't you
just stay and relax?</i>

18:48.261 --> 18:50.294
<i>And then we can have
a nice breakfast later</i>

18:50.296 --> 18:51.262
<i>when you're rested?</i>

18:51.264 --> 18:52.363
Brooke, the flight's booked.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.298
What's going on?
You okay?

18:54.300 --> 18:57.268
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm just tired.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.270
<i>Aw, poor baby.</i>

18:58.271 --> 18:59.871
<i>Well, let me
let you go to sleep.</i>

18:59.873 --> 19:01.806
<i>And I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

19:01.808 --> 19:05.276
<i>- Okay.
- I love you.</i>

19:13.452 --> 19:14.886
All Prada. All tonight.

19:14.888 --> 19:16.787
Tyler said you knew the bag.

19:16.789 --> 19:17.421
Right.

19:17.423 --> 19:20.758
Well, the lady's credit cards
would make it more helpful.

19:20.760 --> 19:21.859
We don't do wallets, man.

19:21.861 --> 19:25.363
Because that would be
beneath you.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.768
Let's go with this one.

19:30.770 --> 19:31.903
Special today... $900.

19:31.905 --> 19:33.538
What do you mean?

19:33.540 --> 19:35.339
That's the number I gave Tyler.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.707
Yeah, and I paid him.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.442
What, is this a shakedown?

19:38.444 --> 19:40.745
Call him.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.547
Aw, this is great!

19:42.549 --> 19:43.314
You call him.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.616
He says I didn't pay you
and I get screwed!

19:57.462 --> 19:59.664
I'm so sorry.

19:59.666 --> 20:00.698
I feel like an idiot.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.201
You have your thing
and now you look all...

20:03.203 --> 20:04.936
Homeless?

20:04.938 --> 20:05.736
No.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.672
Tough?

20:07.674 --> 20:10.541
No, let's stick with homeless.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.710
I'm sorry that
I sent the cops in.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.878
I-I just thought that...

20:13.880 --> 20:16.714
Thought that I couldn't get
beat up all by myself.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.316
No. I assumed you can do that.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.985
I just thought that you were
in over your head.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.320
What's it take

20:22.322 --> 20:25.623
to win a little trust
with you, Ms. Bradshaw?

20:25.625 --> 20:28.793
Well, the purse is out.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.294
What now?

20:30.296 --> 20:31.462
No, it does matter.

20:31.464 --> 20:34.332
It was over
when I missed that train.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.566
What was over?

20:35.568 --> 20:37.401
My marriage.

20:37.403 --> 20:40.671
I had to be home before him.

20:40.673 --> 20:41.872
Oh.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.908
He doesn't know
you're in New York?

20:43.910 --> 20:47.812
No, it's... it's complicated.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.281
Got it.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.885
What is that supposed to mean?

20:54.887 --> 20:57.321
Well, it's not rocket science.

20:57.323 --> 20:58.990
You're not wearing
a wedding ring.

20:58.992 --> 21:00.791
You got to get home
before your husband does.

21:00.793 --> 21:03.594
He doesn't know
you're in New York.

21:03.596 --> 21:06.731
Are you accusing me
of having an affair?

21:06.733 --> 21:08.733
No, it's just...

21:08.735 --> 21:10.701
You know, I'm calling it
like I see it.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.403
It's not a problem.
It's okay.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.972
People are human.
They make mistakes.

21:14.974 --> 21:15.773
Okay, Einstein.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.276
If I was having an affair,
why wouldn't I just

21:18.278 --> 21:21.345
call my boyfriend
and have him bail me out?

21:21.347 --> 21:22.613
I don't know.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.616
Maybe he doesn't know
you're married.

21:26.386 --> 21:29.754
Oh, God! Wait! Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait.

21:29.756 --> 21:30.655
What? What do you want?

21:30.657 --> 21:32.423
Look, thank you for your help,
but it's over.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.758
You can go back
to whatever you were doing

21:33.760 --> 21:35.693
before I came along
and I ruined your night.

21:35.695 --> 21:36.894
Wait, please, stop! Stop!

21:36.896 --> 21:38.062
You didn't ruin my night, okay?

21:38.064 --> 21:39.497
I was hiding out
in Grand Central

21:39.499 --> 21:41.666
trying to avoid this...

21:41.668 --> 21:42.767
Look.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.368
My night was shit
before you showed up.

21:44.370 --> 21:46.671
It's gonna be shit after
you leave. But your night?

21:46.673 --> 21:49.006
If we can get you home
and save your marriage,

21:49.008 --> 21:50.708
well, then...

21:50.710 --> 21:53.544
you know, that would
make me a hero.

21:53.546 --> 21:57.381
Not gonna pass that up, am I?

21:57.383 --> 22:00.351
Look, I don't mean to... pry.

22:00.353 --> 22:01.018
But it seems to me,

22:01.020 --> 22:04.488
the issue is you got
to get home tonight, right?

22:04.490 --> 22:05.923
Yes.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.358
All right, let's work this out.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.626
What time do you have
to be home by?

22:08.628 --> 22:11.329
- At the very latest, at 7:00.
- Okay. Well...

22:11.331 --> 22:13.998
that means we got
to leave by 3:30,

22:14.000 --> 22:15.933
4:00?

22:15.935 --> 22:17.935
We have time.

22:23.575 --> 22:24.709
<i>Manhattan?</i>

22:24.711 --> 22:25.910
<i>Name of business.</i>

22:25.912 --> 22:28.746
<i>Carmel Car Service.</i>

22:28.748 --> 22:29.814
Carmel Car Service.

22:29.816 --> 22:32.550
Hey, how much to Boston
if we leave within the hour?

22:32.552 --> 22:33.617
That's $447.

22:33.619 --> 22:35.786
That's the best you can do?

22:35.788 --> 22:37.388
Includes everything.

22:37.390 --> 22:38.823
Okay, thank you.

22:38.825 --> 22:39.924
What'd they say?

22:39.926 --> 22:41.559
$447... all in.

22:41.561 --> 22:42.793
Can we raise that?

22:42.795 --> 22:43.795
Yeah, I think so.

22:43.796 --> 22:44.995
I got a buddy at my thing.

22:44.997 --> 22:48.132
Really? Because
that would be amazing.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.668
Well, don't thank me yet.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.436
Am I dressed okay for a wedding?

22:52.438 --> 22:54.505
Well, it's probably
just a reception by now.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.974
I'm pretty sure
my friend's still there.

23:12.090 --> 23:13.090
Oh, thank you.

23:13.092 --> 23:16.494
Wow. You're actually good.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.630
No offense.

23:19.632 --> 23:20.765
None taken.

23:20.767 --> 23:23.000
Is that the song
you're gonna play tomorrow?

23:23.002 --> 23:25.436
Uh, I don't know. Maybe.

23:25.438 --> 23:26.537
I think you should.

23:26.539 --> 23:30.908
I mean, if I know anything
about Duke What's His Face,

23:30.910 --> 23:32.610
he's gonna like that song.

23:32.612 --> 23:33.811
Duke Terry.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.446
Yeah. We'll see.

23:35.448 --> 23:38.849
I jammed with his bass player
a couple months ago in D.C.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.451
This guy Lucas Wells.

23:40.453 --> 23:41.552
He liked my shit.

23:41.554 --> 23:43.053
That's wonderful.

23:43.055 --> 23:44.722
Yeah. Anyway... enough about me.

23:44.724 --> 23:48.893
Your story by contrast is
far more compelling.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.494
Oh.

23:50.496 --> 23:51.729
My turn. Okay.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.664
Uh... I'm pretty
straightforward.

23:53.666 --> 23:56.467
I'm a normal girl
with one brother.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.536
A husband who works in finance.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.938
Who I conveniently cannot
provide a photograph,

24:00.940 --> 24:03.707
'cause my phone is broken.

24:03.709 --> 24:04.709
Conveniently.

24:04.710 --> 24:06.110
How'd you guys meet?

24:06.112 --> 24:07.144
I was in London,

24:07.146 --> 24:09.480
um, working at Sotheby's.

24:09.482 --> 24:10.047
Big shot.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.450
Yeah, after a few
years in London,

24:12.452 --> 24:14.919
I started getting this...

24:14.921 --> 24:15.786
I don't know.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.088
Th-The French have
this word,<i> dépaysement,</i>

24:18.090 --> 24:19.223
um, disorientation,

24:19.225 --> 24:22.526
like the feeling of not being
in your home country.

24:22.528 --> 24:24.929
And I had...

24:24.931 --> 24:27.832
a hard time making
friends in London, and...

24:27.834 --> 24:32.102
Aw, that's so sad.

24:32.104 --> 24:32.970
And so my boss was like,

24:32.972 --> 24:35.473
"Do you want to go
to Boston for this show?"

24:35.475 --> 24:37.107
And Michael was there.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.743
Right.

24:39.745 --> 24:41.679
Have you ever had a feeling

24:41.681 --> 24:43.681
and just known
somewhere in your bones

24:43.683 --> 24:47.818
that somebody was gonna play
a major part in your life?

24:47.820 --> 24:49.920
Yeah.

24:52.023 --> 24:55.259
Anyway, he... his wife had,
uh, just left him

24:55.261 --> 24:57.661
for this guy
that we know, and, uh...

24:57.663 --> 24:59.630
at that point,
she'd taken the kids.

24:59.632 --> 25:01.732
And so the last thing
he wanted was

25:01.734 --> 25:02.766
to get involved with someone.

25:02.768 --> 25:05.169
Well, for the record,
I can't imagine you being

25:05.171 --> 25:08.272
the last thing
any man would want.

25:09.941 --> 25:12.243
Thank you.

25:12.878 --> 25:14.011
So I, uh...

25:14.013 --> 25:16.213
I bought the painting
that my boss wanted,

25:16.215 --> 25:18.883
and I sent it back without me,

25:18.885 --> 25:22.052
and I've not been
to London since.

25:22.721 --> 25:24.889
A lot of complications there.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.924
Brave girl.

25:27.125 --> 25:30.561
The funny thing is, I remain
proud of it to this day

25:30.563 --> 25:32.997
that I was...

25:34.633 --> 25:38.536
...the girl who recognized
love and jumped.

25:41.540 --> 25:46.110
<i>So if I know my friend,
he'll be at the open bar.</i>

25:46.112 --> 25:47.244
<i>Hopefully, we can get you home.</i>

25:47.246 --> 25:51.282
<i>Is the person that you
came to see gonna be there?</i>

25:52.818 --> 25:55.886
<i>With our luck, probably.</i>

26:05.730 --> 26:08.032
Is it that bad?

26:08.034 --> 26:09.867
What?

26:10.101 --> 26:13.203
Whatever's waiting
for you up there.

26:14.072 --> 26:15.172
Oh.

26:15.174 --> 26:17.207
It's nothing.

26:27.919 --> 26:30.854
It's an ex... ex-something.

26:34.259 --> 26:37.294
And does the ex-something
have a name?

26:39.064 --> 26:40.230
Hannah.

26:40.232 --> 26:43.067
I haven't seen her in a while.

26:46.071 --> 26:48.005
Was it a bad breakup?

26:48.007 --> 26:50.074
Are there any other kinds?

27:03.021 --> 27:05.055
Did they just have sex in here?

27:05.057 --> 27:07.625
It's better not to know.

27:07.627 --> 27:09.226
But yes.

27:28.847 --> 27:30.314
Is this it?

27:30.316 --> 27:31.348
Good question.

27:31.350 --> 27:35.252
I really only know Danny
and the groom.

27:45.697 --> 27:48.098
Do you know that person?

27:52.070 --> 27:53.237
No.

27:53.239 --> 27:54.905
No, I do not.

27:54.907 --> 27:58.175
Are you sure that
you're up for this?

27:58.177 --> 27:59.843
Yeah.

27:59.845 --> 28:00.911
Yes, yes, yes.

28:00.913 --> 28:03.714
- Don't feel badly.
- No, I don't feel badly.

28:03.716 --> 28:05.883
I feel <i> bad.</i>

28:07.086 --> 28:08.385
Did you just do that?

28:08.387 --> 28:09.920
Did you just correct my grammar?

28:09.922 --> 28:11.455
Oh, stop it, I was teasing.

28:11.457 --> 28:13.157
Have I done that already?

28:13.159 --> 28:14.124
You've been dying to.

28:14.126 --> 28:15.759
That's an interrupted
verb phrase.

28:15.761 --> 28:17.761
I've been silently
correcting you all night.

28:17.763 --> 28:18.729
Don't make that face.

28:18.731 --> 28:21.231
Well, glad to know that we're
at the point in our relationship

28:21.233 --> 28:23.233
where you feel comfortable
doing it out loud.

28:23.235 --> 28:24.768
And it's all downhill from here.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.470
That's funny...
I feel like I missed

28:26.472 --> 28:28.005
all the good uphill stuff.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.773
Oh, thank you.

28:29.775 --> 28:31.909
And what is PWC?

28:31.911 --> 28:34.011
Oh, shit.

28:34.013 --> 28:35.946
Yeah, are we in the right place?

28:35.948 --> 28:38.482
I don't even think
this is a wedding.

28:38.484 --> 28:40.284
Jesus, it's about time.

28:40.286 --> 28:42.186
Where's the rest of the band?

28:42.188 --> 28:44.388
You're an hour late.

28:44.390 --> 28:45.022
Traffic.

28:45.024 --> 28:46.924
I'm sorry, but I'm here.

28:46.926 --> 28:49.259
To hold down the fort,
so to speak.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.395
What am I supposed to do
with one saxophone?

28:51.397 --> 28:53.397
- It's a trumpet.
- Oh, my God.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.065
And my singer,
she's amazing.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.901
This is bullshit, I'm not paying
five grand for that.

28:57.903 --> 29:00.437
Well, of course not,
of course not.

29:00.439 --> 29:02.372
But we will need $600 up front.

29:02.374 --> 29:05.175
In case the rest
of the boys don't show.

29:05.177 --> 29:06.043
Out of the question.

29:06.045 --> 29:10.013
Okay, enjoy your deejay's
playlist.

29:10.015 --> 29:11.982
- Yeah.
- $350.

29:11.984 --> 29:12.416
$500.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.084
That's ten percent,
that's fair.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.353
Fine, now get up
and start playing

29:16.355 --> 29:17.454
while I get the cash.

29:17.456 --> 29:20.891
You can use 1107 as a green room
if you need to store your stuff.

29:20.893 --> 29:22.426
Great.

29:23.161 --> 29:25.496
- No, no. Nick.
- Come on.

29:25.498 --> 29:27.364
I don't sing.

29:27.366 --> 29:29.867
That's not what I heard.

29:29.869 --> 29:32.236
No, there's no way
I can do this.

29:32.238 --> 29:33.137
Yes, you can.

29:33.139 --> 29:35.205
Besides, we need vocals
to sell it.

29:35.207 --> 29:36.273
You want to get home, don't you?

29:36.275 --> 29:39.243
Just pretend it's a room full
of Jonathan what's-his-names.

29:39.245 --> 29:40.544
Weinsteins.

29:40.546 --> 29:41.311
Yeah.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.247
A room full
of Jonathan Weinsteins.

29:43.249 --> 29:45.082
Just keep your clothes on.

29:45.084 --> 29:45.949
Nick, I can't.

29:45.951 --> 29:48.952
All right, but if you got
to take them off,

29:48.954 --> 29:49.820
save it for the finale.

29:49.822 --> 29:52.856
I don't think they'll be able
to follow that up.

29:52.858 --> 29:54.258
Showtime, people.

29:54.260 --> 29:57.461
The one-of-a-kind musical
stylings of...

29:57.463 --> 30:00.464
Nick Vaughn on trumpet,
Brooke Dalton on vocals.

30:00.466 --> 30:01.932
Kicking off this set

30:01.934 --> 30:06.136
with a smoky, wistful
"My Funny Valentine."

32:08.527 --> 32:10.961
No, no, stop that.
Come on, let's go.

32:10.963 --> 32:13.263
Oi, you two!

32:15.601 --> 32:18.535
- Oh, my God, that was insane.
- You were amazing.

32:18.537 --> 32:21.071
- That was crazy.
- Wait, w-w-wait.

32:21.073 --> 32:22.105
The green room.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.473
This way.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.546
Hello? Go ahead.

32:30.181 --> 32:32.683
I got to call Danny, find out
where the hell this guy is.

32:32.685 --> 32:35.118
But your phone died.
Do you remember the number?

32:35.120 --> 32:36.987
What, you don't memorize
all your emergency contacts?

32:36.989 --> 32:41.191
I don't think I get in
as many emergencies as you do.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.264
Danny, it's Nick,
where the hell are you, man?

32:47.266 --> 32:49.166
Listen, you gave me
the wrong address.

32:49.168 --> 32:51.668
Um, this is gonna sound strange.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.971
I need 450 bucks.

32:53.973 --> 32:55.539
Long story, life or death.

32:55.541 --> 32:56.306
Give me a call.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.675
But my phone died, so just leave
a message, okay?

32:58.677 --> 33:00.277
All right.

33:00.411 --> 33:02.546
Do you think he'll get
the message in time?

33:02.548 --> 33:04.581
I don't know.

33:06.351 --> 33:08.352
I got another idea.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.087
Should I be worried?

33:11.023 --> 33:13.023
Concierge, how may
I help you, Mr. Childers?

33:13.025 --> 33:16.226
Yes, I need a car to take
my guest to Boston right away.

33:16.228 --> 33:19.096
And would you like
your regular car service?

33:19.098 --> 33:19.730
Yes.

33:19.732 --> 33:21.398
And how would you like to pay?

33:21.400 --> 33:22.432
Can we charge it to the room?

33:22.434 --> 33:24.167
That should not be
a problem, Mr. Childers.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.335
- Oh, it's a yes.
- Great.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.104
Give me ten minutes, sir.

33:27.106 --> 33:28.705
Thank you.

33:28.707 --> 33:29.473
Are you crazy?

33:29.475 --> 33:30.774
Do you think that's gonna work?

33:30.776 --> 33:31.641
I don't know.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.310
We'll find out in ten minutes.

33:33.312 --> 33:35.312
I like your, uh, shiny trumpet.

33:35.314 --> 33:36.480
Oh, why, thank you.

33:36.482 --> 33:38.215
I hope it's worth enough.

33:38.217 --> 33:39.016
For bail.

33:39.018 --> 33:40.317
When we get arrested.

33:41.286 --> 33:42.619
Well, should be.

33:42.621 --> 33:46.189
I bought it with a shiny
engagement ring.

33:50.661 --> 33:52.329
So talk to me
about these pieces.

33:52.331 --> 33:54.798
Is this done by your famous
London artist guy?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.633
Oh, well, how did you know?

33:56.635 --> 33:59.736
Well, you can tell you need
to know quite a bit about art

33:59.738 --> 34:00.704
in order to appreciate it.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.172
You're an asshole.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.573
Do you know
the most interesting thing

34:03.575 --> 34:06.076
about hotel art is not
the actual art itself,

34:06.078 --> 34:09.379
obviously, but it's
what's behind it.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.380
- What, like a safe?
- No.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.748
Have you heard
of hotel graffiti?

34:12.751 --> 34:14.251
- No.
- This comedian started it

34:14.253 --> 34:15.652
when his TV didn't work
in his hotel room.

34:15.654 --> 34:18.455
He just started doodling on,
like, the back of paintings.

34:18.456 --> 34:19.755
And it caught on from there.

34:19.757 --> 34:23.493
So fingers crossed.

34:24.395 --> 34:25.829
Oh, my...

34:25.831 --> 34:27.330
Wow.

34:27.331 --> 34:28.697
- Oh...
- What?

34:28.699 --> 34:30.167
How can you not appreciate that?

34:30.168 --> 34:32.702
It's the best one
I've ever seen.

34:32.704 --> 34:36.473
"Gotta go,
the hookers are here."

34:36.475 --> 34:39.509
We probably shouldn't touch
anything in this room.

34:48.085 --> 34:51.420
Hi, we ordered a car
for Mr. Childers.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.688
Oh, yes, he's just here.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.157
We got your regular driver.

34:54.159 --> 34:56.259
Except you're not Mr. Childers.

34:56.261 --> 34:57.360
No, I'm Mr. Bradshaw.

34:57.362 --> 34:59.863
I was sent down
with Mr. Childers' guest.

34:59.865 --> 35:01.098
Oh, uh, certainly, sir.

35:01.100 --> 35:04.301
Just give me a second
to ring the room.

35:04.735 --> 35:05.702
That won't be necessary.

35:05.704 --> 35:08.205
You know, it's not that late,
and I feel like a drink.

35:08.207 --> 35:10.474
Is that place
on Halston still open?

35:10.476 --> 35:11.374
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

35:11.376 --> 35:12.342
- Want to go?
- Yeah.

35:12.344 --> 35:14.211
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

35:14.213 --> 35:15.612
Sorry, guys.

35:15.847 --> 35:18.882
<i>All right, we're not dead
yet... we still have time.</i>

35:18.884 --> 35:23.153
Time, but neither money
nor a plan.

35:25.156 --> 35:27.290
What we need is a time machine.

35:27.292 --> 35:28.592
Well, we kind of have one.

35:28.594 --> 35:31.862
A few years ago, they turned
all these public pay phones

35:31.864 --> 35:33.263
into time machines.

35:33.265 --> 35:34.664
You pick one up, dial 1993,

35:34.666 --> 35:36.733
and a New Yorker will come on

35:36.735 --> 35:38.568
and tell you exactly
what was happening

35:38.570 --> 35:40.804
on that corner 20 years ago.

35:40.806 --> 35:42.172
It was funny.

35:42.174 --> 35:44.708
I don't even need
to call that far back.

35:44.710 --> 35:48.145
I just need to call yesterday.

35:50.281 --> 35:52.249
Well, let's try.

35:54.253 --> 35:56.553
What would you tell yourself?

36:05.463 --> 36:09.633
Brooke, it's you
from the future.

36:09.635 --> 36:10.734
She doesn't believe me.

36:10.736 --> 36:13.303
Well, of course; you got to
tell her something secret,

36:13.305 --> 36:15.572
something only you two
would know.

36:19.544 --> 36:22.646
So you know that tiny scar
that you have on your forehead?

36:22.648 --> 36:26.216
The one that you tell everyone
you got hiking in Argentina,

36:26.218 --> 36:31.421
but you actually got
at a Hanson concert in college.

36:31.423 --> 36:34.391
This is my favorite story
already.

36:34.393 --> 36:36.560
Shh. It's collect.

36:36.562 --> 36:39.930
So Pam made you crowd-surf,
and you ended up

36:39.932 --> 36:41.464
hitting the guardrail

36:41.466 --> 36:44.634
and spending
the whole night in the E.R.

36:44.636 --> 36:47.370
Okay, oh, good,
you believe me now.

36:47.372 --> 36:48.805
Okay, so whatever you do,

36:48.807 --> 36:52.475
don't talk to any strangers
in Grand Central.

36:52.477 --> 36:53.977
Ouch.

36:53.979 --> 36:56.580
Actually...

36:56.582 --> 36:58.882
just skip New York altogether.

36:58.884 --> 37:01.318
Stay home, get a movie,
order takeout,

37:01.320 --> 37:02.852
have a bubble bath
and go to bed.

37:02.854 --> 37:07.490
Because everything will be fine
in the morning.

37:07.492 --> 37:09.726
All right.

37:10.494 --> 37:13.597
Yeah, but then
you wouldn't have met me.

37:13.599 --> 37:15.899
I still haven't decided
if that's

37:15.901 --> 37:18.535
a good thing or a bad thing.

37:19.003 --> 37:20.437
All right.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.505
What else do we got?
Let's think.

37:22.507 --> 37:24.908
You're not gonna
get off that easy.

37:24.910 --> 37:25.775
No, no, no.

37:25.777 --> 37:29.779
I don't mess with the physics
of space and time.

37:29.781 --> 37:30.714
Hanson.

37:30.716 --> 37:32.916
All right. All right.

37:32.918 --> 37:33.883
Give it to me.

37:33.885 --> 37:35.885
But I don't want
to do yesterday;

37:35.887 --> 37:37.754
I want to do 2004.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.327
Nick, hey, it's me.

37:44.329 --> 37:47.297
You from the future.

37:47.299 --> 37:48.598
He bought it. Idiot.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.434
Listen, when the Red Sox
make the World Series,

37:51.436 --> 37:54.938
take all your money
and put it on them to win.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.374
Yes, I know it sounds crazy.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.442
Do it.

37:59.444 --> 38:00.944
Okay. Bye.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.779
- That's it?
- That's it.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.447
Everyone knows
when you got a time machine,

38:04.449 --> 38:05.882
the first thing you do
is gamble.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.784
I wasn't aware of that.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.486
And...

38:09.488 --> 38:12.689
...that didn't work.

38:12.857 --> 38:14.624
Oh, shit, what about a bus?

38:14.626 --> 38:16.993
But they don't even
run at night.

38:16.995 --> 38:17.961
No, like a Chinatown bus.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.663
They run all night
and they're cheap.

38:19.665 --> 38:20.864
They're, like, 80 bucks.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.365
- Do we even have that much?
- No.

38:22.367 --> 38:26.436
It's got to be easier
than $500, though.

38:59.970 --> 39:01.971
Well...

39:01.973 --> 39:07.811
Did our best,
but we are almost out of time.

39:08.813 --> 39:10.580
What if we just
call your husband

39:10.582 --> 39:12.382
and tell him you're in New York?

39:12.384 --> 39:14.384
We could make up a good reason.

39:14.386 --> 39:15.418
He already knows about New York.

39:15.420 --> 39:18.922
Well, he doesn't need to know
what you're doing here.

39:18.924 --> 39:21.658
He knows that, too.

39:23.894 --> 39:26.863
Well, then why do you
have to beat him home?

39:26.865 --> 39:30.767
What? Is there something you got
to do before he gets there?

39:30.769 --> 39:31.668
Look, whatever it is,

39:31.670 --> 39:33.136
he's an idiot if he can't
put it past him.

39:33.138 --> 39:34.838
And you're not the type of girl
to marry an idiot.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.940
'Cause even if there were
something that I needed to do

39:36.942 --> 39:39.709
when I get back, I'm still not
gonna make it back in time.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.745
All right, so let's figure out
a way to make it okay

39:41.747 --> 39:44.981
that you didn't do
whatever it is you had to do.

39:45.983 --> 39:47.817
Look, you may have
already thought of this,

39:47.819 --> 39:49.619
but can someone else do it?

39:49.621 --> 39:51.788
Whatever it is?

39:53.791 --> 39:57.594
I'm out of coins.
Are you out of coins?

40:05.404 --> 40:07.470
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

40:07.472 --> 40:08.738
Hello?

40:08.740 --> 40:10.006
- Pam, it's Brooke.
- Brooke.

40:10.008 --> 40:12.709
I'm so sorry to call this late.
Did I wake the baby?

40:12.711 --> 40:14.711
No, no. Are you okay?
What's going on?

40:14.713 --> 40:16.179
<i>I don't know how to say this,</i>

40:16.181 --> 40:17.981
but I need a huge favor,
and I need it now.

40:17.983 --> 40:20.016
Of course, of course, anything.

40:20.018 --> 40:21.584
<i>Okay, so go to my house,</i>

40:21.586 --> 40:22.886
and in the backyard
there's a key

40:22.888 --> 40:24.421
in the magnet box
by the pool filter.

40:24.423 --> 40:26.923
Take the key
and go in the back door.

40:26.925 --> 40:29.859
The alarm code is 4242.

40:29.861 --> 40:31.194
Go up to the bedroom.

40:31.196 --> 40:32.929
On the bed is a letter.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.664
And it's addressed to Michael.

40:34.666 --> 40:37.567
<i>Take it home and save it for me
when I get back.</i>

40:37.569 --> 40:39.002
But listen, promise me
that you won't read it.

40:39.004 --> 40:42.105
Of course I won't, Brooke.
You have my word.

40:42.107 --> 40:44.040
Okay, it's 4:00 a.m. now.

40:44.042 --> 40:45.775
How much time do I have?

40:45.777 --> 40:48.545
You have three hours.

40:49.613 --> 40:54.150
Is there any way I could use
the phone after she's done?

40:54.152 --> 40:56.719
It's as good as done, Brooke.

40:56.721 --> 40:58.054
I love you.

40:58.056 --> 40:58.822
Thank you.

40:58.824 --> 41:00.590
I love you, too.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.492
Call me in an hour.

41:02.494 --> 41:02.926
Okay.

41:02.928 --> 41:06.095
Everything's gonna be
okay now, I promise.

41:06.097 --> 41:06.996
Okay.

41:06.998 --> 41:09.065
- Bye.
- Bye.

41:30.489 --> 41:34.591
You know, I think this is
the first time I've seen you

41:34.593 --> 41:35.525
look genuinely happy.

41:35.527 --> 41:38.795
Well... and for the record,
this is relieved.

41:38.797 --> 41:40.730
Happy is different.

41:40.732 --> 41:42.765
Well, I'm glad it worked out.

41:42.767 --> 41:48.638
And for the record, you could
never cheat on anybody.

41:49.139 --> 41:53.977
Are you the kind of guy
who idealizes women, Nick?

41:54.813 --> 41:56.513
That's a dangerous habit.

41:56.515 --> 41:57.647
Well, I'm a dangerous guy.

41:57.649 --> 42:00.850
Yeah, that's why you got
smashed in the nose.

42:00.852 --> 42:03.219
Did Danny leave you
a voice mail?

42:03.221 --> 42:05.221
Yeah.

42:05.223 --> 42:06.256
He left me the wrong address.

42:06.258 --> 42:09.592
His dyslexia really kicks in
when he's been drinking.

42:09.594 --> 42:10.693
Where is it?

42:10.695 --> 42:14.230
I don't think it matters.
I'm probably not gonna go.

42:14.232 --> 42:16.199
I think we should just
keep walking around.

42:16.201 --> 42:20.270
I hear Central Park's
really safe this time of night.

42:22.006 --> 42:23.540
Wow.

42:23.542 --> 42:24.607
It can't be that bad.

42:24.609 --> 42:27.610
Has it got something to do
with the ex, Hannah?

42:27.612 --> 42:29.212
'Cause I'm happy
to offer my services.

42:29.214 --> 42:33.049
I'm all dressed up,
nowhere to go.

42:33.051 --> 42:34.951
It's okay. It's late.

42:34.953 --> 42:36.886
I think that you're
underestimating me.

42:36.888 --> 42:38.821
I would make a great bodyguard.

42:38.823 --> 42:41.124
Or spiritual advisor.

42:41.126 --> 42:44.294
I can be your Jiminy Cricket.

42:44.296 --> 42:48.298
She's there with somebody.

42:48.300 --> 42:51.034
I see.

42:51.036 --> 42:52.168
Well, I mean, you helped me.

42:52.170 --> 42:56.873
I mean, you saved my marriage.
And that makes you kind of...

42:56.875 --> 42:57.941
- A hero.
- A hero.

42:57.943 --> 43:01.210
And heroes are not afraid
to face their exes.

43:01.212 --> 43:02.212
Don't worry, I'll come.

43:02.213 --> 43:04.914
We can pretend to be
boyfriend and girlfriend.

43:04.916 --> 43:05.982
That'll make her jealous.

43:05.984 --> 43:08.217
She'll know you're not my type.

43:08.219 --> 43:09.953
Oh, my God.

43:09.955 --> 43:12.989
I was just brainstorming.

43:12.991 --> 43:15.925
Maybe she'll think
that I changed you.

43:15.927 --> 43:17.860
That will drive her crazy.

43:17.862 --> 43:20.129
Will you,

43:20.131 --> 43:24.801
Nick Vaughn, be my...

43:24.803 --> 43:25.868
Carrie Bradshaw's...

43:25.870 --> 43:30.740
...Brooke Dalton's
pretend boyfriend?

43:31.942 --> 43:34.344
Man.

43:58.202 --> 44:04.140
I hope this is the right place,
'cause I only know one song.

44:07.745 --> 44:09.045
Nick!

44:09.047 --> 44:11.347
- Hey, man!
- Hey, man.

44:12.250 --> 44:13.750
Hey, hey, I tried
to get your money, man,

44:13.752 --> 44:17.286
but I could only get, like,
350 bucks; I hope it's enough.

44:17.288 --> 44:18.688
Wow.

44:18.690 --> 44:20.056
Hi.

44:20.058 --> 44:21.058
Hey.

44:21.059 --> 44:22.059
I'm Brooke.

44:22.060 --> 44:24.127
- I am Danny.
- Thank you for your help, Danny.

44:24.129 --> 44:27.130
- My pleasure.
- But you can keep the money.

44:27.132 --> 44:27.930
We're okay now.

44:27.932 --> 44:28.965
I feel bad.

44:28.967 --> 44:30.667
We got it all squared away.

44:30.669 --> 44:31.401
What?

44:31.403 --> 44:32.969
I sold a kidney to get this.

44:32.971 --> 44:34.804
I mean, it wasn't mine,
but what am I gonna

44:34.806 --> 44:36.139
tell the hooker
when she wakes up?

44:36.141 --> 44:37.040
Danny.

44:37.042 --> 44:39.175
Kidding!
She's not gonna wake up.

44:39.177 --> 44:41.077
Wow! We there already?

44:41.079 --> 44:42.445
I'm embarrassing him.

44:42.447 --> 44:44.047
Would you like a drink, Brooke?

44:44.049 --> 44:47.116
Danny, you're hitting
on a woman who's taken.

44:47.118 --> 44:48.885
Oh.

44:48.887 --> 44:50.987
I see.

44:50.989 --> 44:51.921
Oh, no, not like that.

44:51.923 --> 44:53.456
No, no.
It's not... it's not for us.

44:53.458 --> 44:55.324
I'm staying
in Danny's room tonight.

44:55.326 --> 44:56.259
- Do me a favor.
- Mm-hmm.

44:56.261 --> 44:58.361
Promise me you won't piss
in the closet this time.

44:58.363 --> 44:59.796
I could promise you
no such thing.

44:59.798 --> 45:02.231
In fact, I may or may not
have had a lot to drink.

45:02.233 --> 45:03.833
What I'm trying
to figure out right now

45:03.835 --> 45:05.735
is if I've had
too much to drink tonight.

45:05.737 --> 45:09.439
Then I realized that if one can
ask oneself that question,

45:09.441 --> 45:12.275
then the answer
must definitely be no.

45:12.277 --> 45:14.043
- Right?
- Danny studied philosophy.

45:14.045 --> 45:17.747
And my latest theory is
that not all women at a wedding

45:17.749 --> 45:19.949
who are taken
are actually taken.

45:19.951 --> 45:21.818
You know what I mean?

45:21.820 --> 45:24.987
Oh, it depends on
your definition of taken.

45:52.015 --> 45:54.350
Hey, Brooke, are you sure
I can't get you a drink?

45:54.352 --> 45:55.752
I'm fine, thank you, Danny.

45:55.754 --> 45:57.487
- I'm sure.
- All right.

45:57.489 --> 45:59.021
Dave! Dave!

45:59.023 --> 46:01.290
You shifty bastard.
How you doing, man?

46:01.292 --> 46:04.427
Your wife lost a lot of weight.
Jesus!

46:04.429 --> 46:07.130
Do you want me to step outside?

46:07.132 --> 46:10.066
Don't move.

46:14.238 --> 46:16.472
Hi.

46:21.345 --> 46:23.880
Wow.

46:29.487 --> 46:31.921
Hannah Dempsey, Brooke Dalton.

46:31.923 --> 46:32.989
Hey, nice to meet you.

46:32.991 --> 46:34.157
Hi, so nice to meet you.

46:34.159 --> 46:38.327
Um, traffic was so bad
all the way from Philly,

46:38.329 --> 46:40.530
I-I thought I had missed you.

46:40.532 --> 46:41.364
You did?

46:41.366 --> 46:43.299
I mean, you did. You did.

46:43.301 --> 46:44.167
You did miss me.

46:44.169 --> 46:47.170
But you're here now, so...

46:47.172 --> 46:48.004
Yes, yes.

46:48.006 --> 46:51.174
I actually thought
I was gonna miss you, too, um...

46:51.176 --> 46:54.043
which I did...

46:54.045 --> 46:55.144
till now.

46:55.146 --> 46:57.547
We could keep this banter up
for minutes.

46:57.549 --> 46:59.482
- Hours.
- We're only this quick

46:59.484 --> 47:00.983
when we're together,
though, so...

47:00.985 --> 47:03.419
...Otherwise, I'm almost boring.

47:07.558 --> 47:12.528
Um, so are you...
are you working or...?

47:12.530 --> 47:14.130
Oh, no, this...

47:14.132 --> 47:14.931
Yes.

47:14.933 --> 47:17.900
He's auditioning
for Duke Terry tomorrow.

47:17.902 --> 47:19.569
Nick!

47:19.571 --> 47:20.403
Well...

47:20.405 --> 47:22.205
That's... that's amazing.

47:22.207 --> 47:25.074
He played with Lucas Wells
in D.C.,

47:25.076 --> 47:26.442
and Lucas loved his shit.

47:26.444 --> 47:29.278
I bet he did.

47:29.280 --> 47:31.848
Okay, spill it.
Tell me all about it.

47:31.850 --> 47:33.049
Here you go, babe.

47:33.051 --> 47:36.919
Oh, um... Cole, this is Brooke.

47:36.921 --> 47:37.620
- Hey.
- Hey.

47:37.622 --> 47:38.855
- Brooke.
- Good to meet you.

47:38.857 --> 47:40.623
- And this is Nick.
- Nick.

47:40.625 --> 47:42.391
Hi.

47:43.126 --> 47:45.461
Nick is auditioning
for Duke Terry tomorrow.

47:45.463 --> 47:47.330
Oh, yeah? Oh!

47:47.332 --> 47:48.598
- The jazz guy. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

47:48.600 --> 47:50.399
We saw him live in Philly
a bunch of times.

47:50.401 --> 47:51.901
That's amazing, great.

47:51.903 --> 47:53.569
Thank you.

47:53.571 --> 47:54.437
Um...

47:54.439 --> 47:57.540
Hey, I know it's getting
kind of late, but would you guys

47:57.542 --> 48:00.476
want to go get a cup of coffee
somewhere or...?

48:00.478 --> 48:02.278
Um, you know, I wish we could.

48:02.280 --> 48:04.013
We're late for something,
though. I'm sorry.

48:04.015 --> 48:05.915
- We were just stopping in.
- Right, right.

48:05.917 --> 48:08.184
Well, I...
we don't want to keep you.

48:08.186 --> 48:10.286
But, um, if something frees up,

48:10.288 --> 48:13.222
I'm at the, the Soho Grand.

48:13.224 --> 48:14.056
Okay.

48:14.058 --> 48:15.958
Um, it was really
nice to meet you.

48:15.960 --> 48:17.360
Nice to meet you, too.

48:17.362 --> 48:18.995
- Pleasure.
- Okay.

48:18.997 --> 48:21.631
- Bye.
- Bye, Cole.

48:30.474 --> 48:33.342
I don't know why we had
to run out of there.

48:33.344 --> 48:35.978
Who's running?

48:35.980 --> 48:38.948
That was running.

48:38.950 --> 48:40.616
Trust me, I know.

48:40.618 --> 48:43.052
I'm the poster girl for running.

48:43.054 --> 48:45.554
Running is easier.

48:49.126 --> 48:50.459
God.

48:50.461 --> 48:55.298
I haven't seen her in six years.

48:55.933 --> 48:58.067
You were fine.

48:58.069 --> 48:59.468
No, I wasn't.

48:59.470 --> 49:00.703
That was awful.

49:00.705 --> 49:02.204
It was embarrassing.

49:02.206 --> 49:04.173
I'm sorry you had to see that.

49:04.175 --> 49:06.709
You'd think after six years
of rehearsing that moment,

49:06.711 --> 49:10.046
I'd have something
more interesting to say.

49:10.048 --> 49:11.147
I don't think she noticed.

49:11.149 --> 49:13.716
And she probably
rehearsed it, too.

49:17.621 --> 49:20.289
Six years?

49:20.291 --> 49:24.427
How'd you guys meet?

49:26.196 --> 49:27.663
Sophomore year.

49:27.665 --> 49:28.631
Georgetown.

49:28.633 --> 49:32.335
I was pre-med
if you can believe that.

49:32.337 --> 49:33.269
I don't.

49:33.271 --> 49:35.137
But I have a good imagination.

49:35.139 --> 49:37.073
Oh, my heart was
never really in it.

49:37.075 --> 49:39.475
Spent all my free time
playing music

49:39.477 --> 49:41.744
and going to shows.

49:41.746 --> 49:44.513
Hannah was the first one
to recognize that.

49:44.515 --> 49:46.449
Made me stay true to it.

49:46.451 --> 49:49.352
Good girl.

49:50.554 --> 49:53.489
And she got into...
graphic design.

49:53.491 --> 49:56.993
Which was the first thing
that she really loved.

49:56.995 --> 50:00.563
Well, she loved you, too, right?

50:00.565 --> 50:04.734
Sometimes I wonder
about that part.

50:06.036 --> 50:10.272
But rarely more
than 50 times a day.

50:10.274 --> 50:13.142
So, what happened?

50:13.144 --> 50:15.411
She got a job offer.

50:15.413 --> 50:17.046
In Philly.

50:17.048 --> 50:20.016
And being the pre-med genius
that I was,

50:20.018 --> 50:24.120
I thought it was the perfect
time to... you know.

50:24.122 --> 50:27.356
Oh, no.

50:27.358 --> 50:29.759
So I bought a ring.

50:29.761 --> 50:33.763
Cost me a fortune.

50:34.465 --> 50:37.266
I was clutching
this thing all day.

50:37.268 --> 50:39.235
My hand was cramping.

50:39.237 --> 50:43.172
We got home
to our apartment in D.C.

50:43.174 --> 50:45.041
And my heart was pounding.

50:45.043 --> 50:46.742
It was beating out of my chest.

50:46.744 --> 50:47.543
I was sweating.

50:47.545 --> 50:49.645
It wasn't nerves, you know.

50:49.647 --> 50:51.714
It was...

50:51.716 --> 50:53.549
excitement.

50:53.551 --> 50:55.151
I was really excited.

50:55.153 --> 50:57.219
I was really...

50:57.221 --> 51:01.524
I was really happy.

51:01.825 --> 51:04.827
And I walked in
and I saw her and...

51:04.829 --> 51:08.464
I just knew something was...

51:08.466 --> 51:10.299
different.

51:10.301 --> 51:14.270
I think it's like
that French word of yours.

51:14.272 --> 51:17.473
<i>- Dépaysement.</i>
- Yeah.

51:19.810 --> 51:21.510
She said...

51:21.512 --> 51:25.247
she thought it was
a good time for a break.

51:25.649 --> 51:28.451
That's terrible.

51:28.453 --> 51:31.287
What did you do?

51:31.289 --> 51:34.657
What could I do?

51:34.659 --> 51:36.792
Beg? Cry?

51:36.794 --> 51:38.494
Didn't.

51:38.496 --> 51:40.229
Didn't do any of it.

51:40.231 --> 51:42.465
Just... sat there.

51:42.467 --> 51:44.834
Devastated.

51:44.836 --> 51:48.471
God, I was so completely...

51:48.473 --> 51:50.539
Blindsided.

51:50.541 --> 51:53.309
Yeah.

51:55.378 --> 51:56.846
That was it.

51:56.848 --> 51:59.648
Till tonight.

52:01.219 --> 52:01.884
It's funny.

52:01.886 --> 52:05.621
I got to the city at noon and I
just couldn't leave the station.

52:05.623 --> 52:08.324
I just couldn't do it.

52:08.326 --> 52:11.560
Stuck in the middle
till you got stuck with me?

52:11.562 --> 52:13.729
Am I stuck with you?

52:13.731 --> 52:15.297
Sorry to tell you.

52:15.299 --> 52:18.767
Sounds bad when you
put it like that.

52:20.203 --> 52:21.470
I'm sorry.

52:21.472 --> 52:22.204
For what?

52:22.206 --> 52:24.607
For letting you sit out here
and talk about it for so long

52:24.609 --> 52:26.442
and not making you go back.

52:26.444 --> 52:28.410
Oh, no.

52:28.412 --> 52:30.279
No, that's not happening.

52:30.281 --> 52:33.182
You didn't come
all the way to New York

52:33.184 --> 52:34.717
for a sign to do nothing.

52:34.719 --> 52:36.752
Yeah, well, I thought
she'd be alone.

52:36.754 --> 52:39.155
Not like in a depressing way.

52:39.157 --> 52:40.157
In like a romantic way.

52:40.158 --> 52:41.190
A girl like that is never alone.

52:41.192 --> 52:43.759
So you can't use that
for an excuse.

52:43.761 --> 52:45.694
And there was
something between you.

52:45.696 --> 52:46.762
You saw it and I saw it.

52:46.764 --> 52:48.597
That doesn't mean anything.

52:48.599 --> 52:49.932
It means something.

52:49.934 --> 52:51.734
It means you have a chance.

52:51.736 --> 52:53.169
For what... to get slammed?

52:53.171 --> 52:57.339
Haven't you felt slammed
every day since the ring thing?

52:57.341 --> 52:59.175
And you don't know the odds.

52:59.177 --> 53:00.342
Could be one in a trillion.

53:00.344 --> 53:01.777
It could be one in two.

53:01.779 --> 53:03.412
Anyway, this is about regret.

53:03.414 --> 53:05.814
And those odds are always 100%.

53:05.816 --> 53:08.384
There was a spark, Nick.

53:08.386 --> 53:11.787
And that guy she was with?

53:11.789 --> 53:13.489
Cole?

53:13.491 --> 53:15.457
I've seen that guy all my life.

53:15.459 --> 53:17.960
You're worth a thousand Coles.

53:18.930 --> 53:21.397
What happened to a trillion?

53:21.399 --> 53:23.666
He was tall.

53:24.302 --> 53:25.668
She might not even be with him!

53:25.670 --> 53:31.307
She said,<i> "I</i> am staying
at the Soho Grand."

53:32.842 --> 53:35.511
You're not gonna
ask her to marry you.

53:35.513 --> 53:39.481
What if I ask her
to get married by mistake?

53:43.220 --> 53:45.354
God. Why is it
that any one decision

53:45.356 --> 53:49.358
always seems too small to be the
biggest decision of your life?

53:49.360 --> 53:51.760
I don't know.

53:51.962 --> 53:53.596
But sometimes you have to just

53:53.598 --> 53:56.432
make the choice and jump.

53:58.335 --> 54:02.871
You're right. You're right.

54:04.307 --> 54:06.242
I'll do it.

54:06.244 --> 54:08.410
Oh, God.

54:09.346 --> 54:12.248
Are you planning on holding
my hand the whole time?

54:12.250 --> 54:13.282
No.

54:13.284 --> 54:16.352
Give me your trumpet.

55:12.642 --> 55:14.310
So?

55:14.312 --> 55:15.312
She's happy I came back.

55:15.313 --> 55:16.612
We're going to lunch tomorrow.

55:16.614 --> 55:18.547
- See?
- The three of us.

55:18.549 --> 55:20.349
She invited that guy?

55:20.351 --> 55:21.517
Of course not.

55:21.519 --> 55:22.951
She invited me?

55:22.953 --> 55:24.386
Nope.

55:24.388 --> 55:27.623
Nick, will you stop
and talk to me?

55:27.625 --> 55:29.358
She's pregnant.

55:29.360 --> 55:31.927
But it's good, though,
you know why?

55:31.929 --> 55:34.029
You know what she said?

55:34.564 --> 55:36.965
She said she's happy
I'm auditioning for Duke

55:36.967 --> 55:40.069
'cause she always
believed in me.

55:40.071 --> 55:42.871
I'm so sorry.

55:42.873 --> 55:45.407
Sorry you're an idiot?

55:45.409 --> 55:47.343
Well, me, too.

55:47.345 --> 55:48.977
Are you okay?

55:48.979 --> 55:51.413
Well, because if you're not,
I really don't know

55:51.415 --> 55:52.881
what I'll do with the guilt.

55:52.883 --> 55:56.518
Well, then I'm miserable.

56:00.890 --> 56:04.727
It's probably the most okay
I've been since she's left.

56:04.729 --> 56:10.032
Because at least I know
something concrete, you know?

56:10.800 --> 56:14.870
Instead of having years
of fantasies and...

56:14.872 --> 56:17.406
possibilities...

56:17.408 --> 56:19.875
I know it's over.

56:19.877 --> 56:23.812
So... thank you for that.

56:23.814 --> 56:26.014
Okay.

56:26.016 --> 56:30.619
I'm still waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

56:33.490 --> 56:37.760
She said she's
never been so happy.

56:43.833 --> 56:45.768
But I guess I got
to be grown up.

56:45.770 --> 56:48.504
Got to be okay
with not being okay.

56:48.506 --> 56:50.839
Which completely sucks.

56:50.841 --> 56:55.144
So... thank you for that, too.

56:55.146 --> 56:58.080
Well...

56:58.082 --> 57:00.649
what do you want to do now?

57:00.651 --> 57:04.620
We've covered every
crucial topic in our lives.

57:04.622 --> 57:07.055
What's left?

57:07.057 --> 57:10.159
Small talk.

57:12.829 --> 57:15.631
Come on.

57:15.633 --> 57:16.865
It's past my bedtime.

57:16.867 --> 57:20.002
I think we're both running
on fumes at this point.

57:20.004 --> 57:21.203
I know and I feel bad!

57:21.205 --> 57:22.204
You have your audition tomorrow.

57:22.206 --> 57:23.872
I feel like you should
be sleeping

57:23.874 --> 57:25.574
- or practicing or...
- Nah.

57:25.576 --> 57:28.544
I don't think
it matters anymore.

57:28.546 --> 57:29.611
What does that mean?

57:29.613 --> 57:31.146
I don't think I'm gonna go.

57:31.148 --> 57:33.148
But that's why you came
to New York.

57:33.150 --> 57:35.584
To ask the stars
for a sign or whatever,

57:35.586 --> 57:37.786
and the audition was your sign.

57:37.788 --> 57:38.487
I know.

57:38.489 --> 57:39.488
But the girl was the thing.

57:39.490 --> 57:41.957
No, I'm not gonna let you
get away with that.

57:41.959 --> 57:44.927
I heard you play,
and you loved it.

57:44.929 --> 57:46.161
Remember?

57:46.163 --> 57:49.965
Kind of feel like
it doesn't love me back.

58:03.246 --> 58:06.048
Let's do it.

58:07.017 --> 58:08.884
Come on, we've talked
about our past.

58:08.886 --> 58:10.086
Let's talk about our future.

58:10.087 --> 58:11.253
We can get a sign for your sign.

58:11.255 --> 58:14.022
Come on, you don't take
this seriously, do you?

58:14.024 --> 58:15.257
It's a scam.

58:15.259 --> 58:16.992
They tell you something vague.

58:16.994 --> 58:18.093
Your brain fills in the rest.

58:18.095 --> 58:21.864
Well, I don't expect the psychic
to solve both our problems.

58:21.866 --> 58:24.066
I think you're
taking it too seriously.

58:24.068 --> 58:25.801
Well, then what's the point?

58:25.803 --> 58:27.569
The point is, so what?

58:27.571 --> 58:28.904
I don't need to know my future.

58:28.906 --> 58:30.572
I'm gonna live it anyway.

58:30.574 --> 58:35.711
You don't have to believe it
for it to make an impact.

58:37.615 --> 58:39.948
All right.

58:39.950 --> 58:41.650
Okay.

58:41.652 --> 58:43.785
Are they even open?

58:47.690 --> 58:49.157
Oh!

58:49.159 --> 58:50.926
Hello.

58:50.928 --> 58:52.628
You're good.

58:52.630 --> 58:54.596
Did you know we were coming?

58:54.598 --> 58:55.531
What?

58:55.533 --> 58:56.832
Oh! Oh, no.

58:56.834 --> 58:59.034
No, it's trash day.

58:59.036 --> 59:01.036
Do you want a reading?

59:01.738 --> 59:03.772
We don't have any money.

59:03.774 --> 59:04.806
I know.

59:04.808 --> 59:06.708
I had trouble sleeping.

59:06.710 --> 59:08.911
So I can use some company.

59:08.913 --> 59:10.913
Come on in.

59:10.915 --> 59:12.714
All right.

59:12.716 --> 59:14.049
He knows?

59:14.051 --> 59:16.919
Should I be impressed
or offended?

59:16.921 --> 59:18.186
<i>Okay.</i>

59:18.188 --> 59:19.788
Who wants to go first?

59:19.790 --> 59:20.822
Don't you use

59:20.824 --> 59:24.259
tarot cards or a crystal ball
or something?

59:24.261 --> 59:25.060
Oh, I used to.

59:25.062 --> 59:27.629
My wife thought
it made the customers

59:27.631 --> 59:30.299
more comfortable if they saw me

59:30.301 --> 59:33.035
actually doing something.

59:33.037 --> 59:34.970
But the truth is,

59:34.972 --> 59:37.673
all I really do is look at you.

59:37.675 --> 59:39.841
Tell you what I see.

59:39.843 --> 59:43.078
Where's your wife now?

59:43.080 --> 59:45.113
She passed.

59:45.115 --> 59:46.081
Oh.

59:46.083 --> 59:47.616
I'm sorry to hear that.

59:47.618 --> 59:50.052
It's all right.

59:50.054 --> 59:52.588
Okay, who's first?

59:52.590 --> 59:54.089
- Oh, him fir...
- Start with her.

59:54.091 --> 59:56.992
Okay, I'm seeing...

59:56.994 --> 01:00:00.762
a trumpet! You're
a musician of some kind!

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:03.031
Your gift is truly staggering.

01:00:03.033 --> 01:00:05.033
Works every time.

01:00:05.035 --> 01:00:06.602
Even the skeptics.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:10.939
All right... young lady.

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:16.812
What are we going
to do with you?

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:18.981
You're at a crossroads, my dear.

01:00:18.983 --> 01:00:22.284
You think you know exactly...

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:23.986
what your problem is,

01:00:23.988 --> 01:00:26.955
and you're exactly wrong.

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:28.790
Why is that?

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:30.359
You think you're trapped

01:00:30.361 --> 01:00:32.861
by what's happening to you.

01:00:32.863 --> 01:00:35.797
Actually, you've got choices.

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:38.834
You're just afraid
to look at them.

01:00:38.836 --> 01:00:42.371
Okay. What are they?

01:00:42.373 --> 01:00:44.239
You could walk away.

01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:45.974
From what?

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:47.409
I don't know.

01:00:47.411 --> 01:00:50.212
But you do.

01:00:50.214 --> 01:00:52.848
We can always walk away.

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:55.183
And sometimes you should.

01:00:56.753 --> 01:00:59.888
You could have a future
with our boy, here.

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:05.093
And no, I don't say that
to every couple who walks in.

01:01:05.095 --> 01:01:06.662
Nick is a terrific guy,

01:01:06.664 --> 01:01:10.165
but I'm actually married
to somebody else.

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:14.036
You asked me about your choices.

01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:17.005
I stand by what I see.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:20.075
But what if the things that...

01:01:20.077 --> 01:01:21.410
really matter...

01:01:21.412 --> 01:01:24.346
what if those choices
aren't up to me?

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:27.883
You know the most important
thing I learned,

01:01:27.885 --> 01:01:31.119
after all my years of marriage?

01:01:31.121 --> 01:01:35.457
After an entire life
with one person?

01:01:35.459 --> 01:01:36.692
What's that?

01:01:36.694 --> 01:01:41.229
That you can't allow
the people you love

01:01:41.231 --> 01:01:44.900
to determine how you love.

01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:49.137
Easier said than done.

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:51.339
Sorry.

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:53.375
No refunds.

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:57.179
Would you mind
if I used your phone?

01:01:57.181 --> 01:02:01.416
Oh, well, there's... there's a
phone in the room down the hall.

01:02:01.418 --> 01:02:05.020
Might give you
a little more privacy.

01:02:05.022 --> 01:02:06.054
Okay, thank you.

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:07.856
Give Nick and I

01:02:07.858 --> 01:02:10.425
a moment to chat.

01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:12.994
Picking up
any Powerball numbers?

01:02:12.996 --> 01:02:16.832
I don't do races, roulette,

01:02:16.834 --> 01:02:17.999
or Powerballs.

01:02:18.001 --> 01:02:19.134
- This your wife?
- Yes.

01:02:19.136 --> 01:02:21.503
She's beautiful.
Where was this taken?

01:02:21.505 --> 01:02:23.872
We danced our way
through something else.

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:32.447
Hello.

01:02:32.449 --> 01:02:33.782
Hey. It's me.

01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:35.016
Oh, my God, Brooke.

01:02:35.018 --> 01:02:36.118
I've been trying to call you.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.452
I couldn't get the letter.

01:02:37.454 --> 01:02:38.987
There was no key.

01:02:38.989 --> 01:02:39.755
What?!

01:02:39.757 --> 01:02:42.324
It's in the magnetized box,
by the pool filter.

01:02:42.326 --> 01:02:43.825
No, it wasn't.

01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:45.761
I went over there,
and I found the box,

01:02:45.763 --> 01:02:46.862
but there was no key inside.

01:02:46.864 --> 01:02:49.498
Someone must've taken it
and not put it back.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.099
Um...

01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:52.301
Uh, you can break it;
break in.

01:02:52.302 --> 01:02:54.536
I know!
That's what I tried to do.

01:02:54.538 --> 01:02:55.403
I went to the back door,

01:02:55.405 --> 01:02:56.772
where I thought
no one could see,

01:02:56.774 --> 01:02:59.141
and I found a rock,
and I broke the back window,

01:02:59.143 --> 01:03:00.275
but the alarm went off.

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:01.042
I panicked.

01:03:01.044 --> 01:03:02.144
I'm so sorry, Brooke,

01:03:02.146 --> 01:03:03.378
but I panicked and ran.

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:04.312
Okay, okay.

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:05.781
It's okay, honey.
You tried.

01:03:05.783 --> 01:03:07.182
I'm so sorry.

01:03:07.184 --> 01:03:08.884
It's okay. It's okay.

01:03:10.521 --> 01:03:11.887
It's already 5:00 a.m.,

01:03:11.889 --> 01:03:15.056
so why don't you
just get some sleep?

01:03:17.027 --> 01:03:18.527
All right.

01:03:18.529 --> 01:03:19.494
Okay.

01:03:19.496 --> 01:03:20.829
Bye.

01:03:22.865 --> 01:03:27.435
Believe me, I'd sure try,
if she was around.

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:31.106
I was at this party,
just after college,

01:03:31.108 --> 01:03:32.874
and the music came on.

01:03:32.876 --> 01:03:36.244
It was "Moon River."

01:03:36.246 --> 01:03:37.946
And then...

01:03:37.948 --> 01:03:39.247
here comes this girl...

01:03:39.249 --> 01:03:44.152
the most beautiful girl
I had ever seen!

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:45.086
She comes up to me...

01:03:45.088 --> 01:03:50.192
and just drags me right out
onto the dance floor.

01:03:50.194 --> 01:03:51.359
I tried to...

01:03:51.361 --> 01:03:54.162
I had no idea how to dance.

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:56.097
But it didn't matter.

01:03:56.099 --> 01:03:59.901
I would've made an absolute
fool out of myself

01:03:59.903 --> 01:04:04.539
just to spend
one minute with her.

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:07.209
And I did.

01:04:07.211 --> 01:04:09.578
And it all started...

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:12.180
with a song.

01:04:13.616 --> 01:04:16.251
Wow.

01:04:16.253 --> 01:04:18.520
You guys seemed perfect.

01:04:18.522 --> 01:04:20.355
Well, Nick...

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:23.859
there is no perfect.

01:04:24.493 --> 01:04:26.595
There will always be struggle.

01:04:26.597 --> 01:04:31.333
You just have to pick
who you want to struggle with.

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:56.157
You okay?

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:01.296
He's only clairvoyant.

01:05:01.298 --> 01:05:03.398
What does he know?

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:06.067
I feel so marginalized.

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:09.104
He didn't even talk
about my future.

01:05:12.275 --> 01:05:15.176
I don't suppose you want to take
a crack at it, do you?

01:05:15.178 --> 01:05:17.679
I know that
you're trying to cheer me up,

01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:19.247
and I appreciate it.

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:21.249
But this is a huge tangled mess,

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:24.386
and I'm sorry
I dragged you into it.

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:29.524
So would that be a no?

01:05:30.993 --> 01:05:33.995
You really want
to know your future?

01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:36.564
Maybe not.

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:44.706
You're a working musician
until your lips fall off.

01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:46.641
You're revered.

01:05:46.643 --> 01:05:47.409
You have a...

01:05:47.411 --> 01:05:50.178
- Maserati?
- A dog...

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:53.415
functioning credit cards...

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:59.154
Fall in love with a woman
who deserves you.

01:05:59.156 --> 01:06:02.157
And she trusts you.

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:08.964
Well, if I ever got that lucky,

01:06:08.966 --> 01:06:12.667
I probably wouldn't plan on
letting her down.

01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:25.313
My anniversary
with Michael is August 17.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:28.316
And this year, I decided
impulsively to surprise him.

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:29.985
He was in Atlanta.

01:06:29.987 --> 01:06:31.753
So I open his computer to check

01:06:31.755 --> 01:06:34.055
when his last meeting
will be, and...

01:06:34.057 --> 01:06:36.591
this e-mail pops up...

01:06:37.226 --> 01:06:38.093
flagged urgent,

01:06:38.095 --> 01:06:41.696
"tonight."

01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:44.432
It was about a meeting,
all right.

01:06:44.434 --> 01:06:47.569
It was the Ritz-Carlton,
room 1216,

01:06:47.571 --> 01:06:51.306
at midnight, signed "L."

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:54.576
And over the months
that followed...

01:06:54.578 --> 01:06:59.547
he would address her as Lynn
and she would sign back...

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:05.754
"Linny."

01:07:06.288 --> 01:07:08.790
- What'd you do?
- Nothing.

01:07:08.792 --> 01:07:13.728
I just read the e-mails over
and over, like a novel.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:21.569
He would tell her things
from the heart.

01:07:21.571 --> 01:07:23.471
Things...

01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:27.308
Worries...

01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:29.744
Funny things.

01:07:30.746 --> 01:07:34.482
Things that you tell someone
that you love.

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:36.818
And your marriage?

01:07:40.122 --> 01:07:42.824
It was seemingly unchanged.

01:07:43.426 --> 01:07:46.694
Except that... every look,

01:07:46.696 --> 01:07:49.330
every joke...

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:53.535
every time we made love...

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:56.604
...became lies.

01:07:58.374 --> 01:07:59.707
And I was paralyzed.

01:07:59.709 --> 01:08:02.610
I couldn't confront him,
you know?

01:08:02.612 --> 01:08:03.612
This is my life.

01:08:03.613 --> 01:08:04.546
It's my marriage.

01:08:04.548 --> 01:08:10.385
This is my world and this is
my one chance at love.

01:08:13.355 --> 01:08:16.091
But then it stopped.

01:08:16.093 --> 01:08:18.693
He said he felt guilty.

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:23.564
So maybe he chose me.

01:08:24.265 --> 01:08:28.736
And then, two days ago,
he goes to Atlanta.

01:08:28.738 --> 01:08:33.174
And I open the computer
and there it was...

01:08:33.176 --> 01:08:36.611
There was an e-mail
from her saying...

01:08:37.712 --> 01:08:40.348
"I hear you're gonna be in town.

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:43.283
Are you free tomorrow night?"

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:44.352
And I went crazy,

01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:47.889
and I wanted
to tear out his eyes.

01:08:50.826 --> 01:08:53.228
So I wrote him a letter.

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:54.362
I told him everything I knew

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:56.531
and all the lovey things
he wrote to her and...

01:08:56.533 --> 01:08:58.500
all the mean things
I wanted to say to him.

01:08:58.502 --> 01:09:01.903
I mean, I dreamed of writing
that letter for months.

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:05.840
And then, the grand finale,
I took my engagement ring,

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:09.344
my wedding ring and I put them
in the... envelope,

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:13.548
and I left it on the bed,
on the pillow.

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:19.187
Only, now, he's coming home
instead of going to see her.

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:27.795
When I was sitting
in that bar...

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:33.301
I suddenly realize
that I love Michael and...

01:09:33.303 --> 01:09:35.203
all these moments
came flooding back to me.

01:09:35.205 --> 01:09:38.606
You know,
all the moments we shared.

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:47.182
And... the lifetime of moments
that lay ahead and...

01:09:47.616 --> 01:09:50.318
I realized that
I'd thrown it all away.

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:53.688
I don't think
you've thrown anything away.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.890
I did.

01:09:57.259 --> 01:09:58.893
You haven't seen the letter.

01:10:00.297 --> 01:10:02.931
There's no coming back from it.

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:11.206
I could've talked to him or
forgiven him or worked it out.

01:10:15.477 --> 01:10:17.979
But I can't
come back from that venom

01:10:17.981 --> 01:10:21.683
and that hatred
and that ugliness.

01:10:26.223 --> 01:10:27.455
And so...

01:10:27.457 --> 01:10:29.891
I knew I had to get back home,

01:10:29.893 --> 01:10:32.927
so I could destroy
the evidence.

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:36.798
And I jump up...

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:40.335
to grab my bag,
and I turn around...

01:10:40.337 --> 01:10:43.705
Only it wasn't there.

01:11:17.539 --> 01:11:20.441
Sometimes I think
about her skin.

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:23.945
I think about
if it's softer than mine.

01:11:23.947 --> 01:11:26.347
Brooke, don't do that.

01:11:27.049 --> 01:11:29.817
I hate him for that.

01:11:31.587 --> 01:11:33.855
But you love him.

01:11:34.923 --> 01:11:37.992
What if he loves her more?

01:11:37.994 --> 01:11:41.296
I'd say that's a long shot.

01:11:41.298 --> 01:11:43.765
It's possible, isn't it?

01:11:43.899 --> 01:11:46.601
It's possible that
you could meet somebody

01:11:46.603 --> 01:11:47.635
who's perfect for you,

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:50.738
even though you're committed
to somebody else.

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:51.706
No. No.

01:11:51.708 --> 01:11:53.341
See, I think if
you're committed to somebody,

01:11:53.343 --> 01:11:56.644
you don't allow yourself to find
perfection in someone else.

01:11:56.646 --> 01:12:01.382
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:04.085
Well, if it's
what you want to hear,

01:12:04.087 --> 01:12:07.922
I think you already
made up your mind.

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:16.831
I think he's gonna find that
letter and call you immediately.

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:20.368
Well, what if you're wrong?

01:12:20.370 --> 01:12:24.072
Well, then you face the music.

01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:28.910
But at least you were brave.

01:12:28.912 --> 01:12:29.844
You didn't run.

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:33.448
You held up your end
of the bargain.

01:12:36.752 --> 01:12:39.887
I think he's gonna be
begging you to forgive him.

01:12:39.889 --> 01:12:41.689
I think he made a mistake.

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:43.758
And I think he knows it.

01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:48.763
We love who we love.

01:12:48.765 --> 01:12:50.598
Sucks.

01:12:59.441 --> 01:13:01.743
Uh, I'll be right back.

01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:07.415
Uh, is-is there
a bathroom back here?

01:13:07.417 --> 01:13:09.050
Yeah.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.474
Taxi!

01:13:36.812 --> 01:13:38.446
What, I don't get a letter?

01:13:38.448 --> 01:13:39.414
- I have to go.
- Where?

01:13:39.416 --> 01:13:40.581
Are you people getting in,
or what?

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:42.183
- This woman doesn't have
- He doesn't get out,

01:13:42.185 --> 01:13:43.651
any money,
she's gonna stiff you.

01:13:43.653 --> 01:13:44.852
Call the police.
Give me one second,

01:13:44.854 --> 01:13:46.854
I will handle this.
I'm gonna go to JFK, and then

01:13:46.856 --> 01:13:48.423
I'm gonna wake up
my mom in Indianapolis,

01:13:48.425 --> 01:13:50.091
and I'm gonna stay there
for a while, and I don't know.

01:13:50.093 --> 01:13:52.026
I'll figure something out
from there. Maybe London.

01:13:52.028 --> 01:13:53.861
London? What are you
talking about, Brooke?

01:13:53.863 --> 01:13:54.762
How are you gonna fly?

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:56.464
You don't have an I.D.,
you don't have money.

01:13:56.466 --> 01:13:58.599
- I don't know.
- I'm out of here.

01:13:58.601 --> 01:14:00.468
Oh, great, thank you.

01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:02.437
I'm not gonna let you run.

01:14:02.439 --> 01:14:02.970
Why you?

01:14:02.972 --> 01:14:05.072
Because I think
I know who you are.

01:14:05.074 --> 01:14:05.907
And who's that?

01:14:05.909 --> 01:14:07.608
You're the girl
who recognized true love

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:09.544
- and jumped for it.
- I can still be that girl.

01:14:09.546 --> 01:14:12.213
But maybe I picked
the wrong guy.

01:14:12.215 --> 01:14:13.215
Nobody said I was smart.

01:14:13.216 --> 01:14:15.149
Yeah, well, five minutes ago,
you said you loved him.

01:14:15.151 --> 01:14:17.518
Five minutes ago,
<i>you</i> said I loved him.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.654
I haven't said it
for a half hour.

01:14:19.656 --> 01:14:21.889
There's got to be
a better way to do this.

01:14:21.891 --> 01:14:23.191
What is it? You got
any bright ideas?

01:14:23.193 --> 01:14:25.193
You got another one
of your fucking bright ideas?

01:14:25.195 --> 01:14:26.227
No, I don't, I don't.

01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:27.895
But right now,
I'm the best advice you have.

01:14:27.897 --> 01:14:30.832
Well, if that doesn't tell you
everything you need to know.

01:14:30.834 --> 01:14:31.699
Meaning?

01:14:31.701 --> 01:14:33.634
Meaning if all I've got
is life advice

01:14:33.636 --> 01:14:36.037
from a stranger that
I met four hours ago,

01:14:36.039 --> 01:14:37.472
then I'm in big trouble.

01:14:37.474 --> 01:14:39.574
You quit med school
to be a musician, right?

01:14:39.576 --> 01:14:41.909
And now you're willing to blow
off the biggest audition

01:14:41.911 --> 01:14:45.046
of your life because the girl
you loved didn't choose you?

01:14:45.048 --> 01:14:48.149
See, it hurts, doesn't it, Nick?

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:51.185
Who needs to face the music now?

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.753
The only thing
that is stopping you

01:14:52.755 --> 01:14:54.155
from being the biggest loser
in New York

01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:57.158
is the fact that
I haven't left town yet.

01:15:02.165 --> 01:15:05.233
Okay. Okay.

01:15:08.003 --> 01:15:10.905
Look, I hate when people
use this expression,

01:15:10.907 --> 01:15:12.707
so I'm sorry I'm about to,

01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:14.208
but can we just breathe?

01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:16.277
Can we just breathe?

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.047
It's been a long night.

01:15:20.049 --> 01:15:22.016
<i>We got a couple hours</i>

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:24.819
<i>before we got to get you
on your train.</i>

01:15:24.821 --> 01:15:29.223
<i>I think I know somewhere warm
we can go unwind.</i>

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:51.178
Danny?

01:15:56.318 --> 01:15:57.952
Where do you think he is?

01:15:57.954 --> 01:16:00.655
He's probably
passed out somewhere.

01:16:00.657 --> 01:16:02.290
You can go first.

01:16:02.292 --> 01:16:03.090
Thank you.

01:16:03.092 --> 01:16:05.893
I'm gonna order room service.
You hungry?

01:16:05.895 --> 01:16:06.861
I'm starving.

01:16:06.863 --> 01:16:07.895
What can we afford?

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:10.665
Well, I was gonna charge it
to the room.

01:16:10.667 --> 01:16:13.067
I think we have a $300 budget.

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:14.302
Okay.

01:16:14.304 --> 01:16:16.237
Surprise me?

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:22.743
Nick?

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:24.579
Yeah.

01:16:26.214 --> 01:16:29.216
I'm sorry about all those things
that I said earlier.

01:16:29.218 --> 01:16:32.853
I guess I got
a little defensive.

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:36.924
Define "defensive."

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:38.960
Um...

01:16:39.728 --> 01:16:41.329
Abusive?

01:16:42.664 --> 01:16:44.298
Cruel?

01:16:47.235 --> 01:16:49.036
Complex.

01:16:50.772 --> 01:16:52.940
Okay.

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:55.343
Sorry.

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:30.378
What are you doing?

01:19:03.472 --> 01:19:04.872
I can't.

01:19:04.874 --> 01:19:06.774
I'm sorry...

01:19:06.776 --> 01:19:08.743
I'm sorry.

01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:14.315
At least you waited a few hours.

01:19:14.317 --> 01:19:17.752
That way, I don't feel
like a rebound.

01:19:19.888 --> 01:19:23.324
Did I mention
that you were charming?

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:25.760
You phrased it differently.

01:19:25.762 --> 01:19:27.862
What was that?

01:19:27.864 --> 01:19:29.964
"Biggest loser in New York"?

01:19:33.101 --> 01:19:34.935
Sorry.

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:47.081
I got an idea.

01:19:47.083 --> 01:19:48.083
Okay.

01:20:49.011 --> 01:20:53.314
<i>"Thank you for your stay,
please help us improve."</i>

01:20:53.316 --> 01:20:55.449
"Appearance."

01:20:55.451 --> 01:20:57.218
Fair.

01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:59.153
Not the... fair. Blonde.

01:20:59.155 --> 01:21:02.156
<i>Light-skinned, fair.</i>

01:21:02.924 --> 01:21:05.526
<i>"Cleanliness."</i>

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:07.228
Much improved.

01:21:09.866 --> 01:21:10.297
"Decor."

01:21:10.299 --> 01:21:15.636
Well, the art needed some work,
but we fixed that shit.

01:21:16.538 --> 01:21:19.373
<i>"Would you be
likely to return?"</i>

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:21.442
<i>Let's leave that one blank.</i>

01:21:21.444 --> 01:21:22.409
<i>Good idea.</i>

01:21:22.411 --> 01:21:25.579
"How would you rate
your overall stay?"

01:21:30.052 --> 01:21:32.486
Exceeds expectations.

01:21:53.108 --> 01:21:56.210
How can one of the worst
nights of my life

01:21:56.212 --> 01:21:58.279
also be one of the best?

01:22:00.615 --> 01:22:01.982
I don't know.

01:22:01.984 --> 01:22:08.188
I feel that we met
in Grand Central for a reason.

01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:15.162
I think that we were meant
to find each other.

01:22:25.408 --> 01:22:26.573
Want to know the real reason

01:22:26.575 --> 01:22:28.342
I stuck with music
all those years?

01:22:28.344 --> 01:22:31.578
'Cause Hannah wanted you to?

01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:33.681
Not really.

01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:38.052
I dreamt that one day, I'd be
playing with someone like Duke,

01:22:38.054 --> 01:22:40.354
and Hannah would walk in...

01:22:40.356 --> 01:22:43.357
And she'd see what she lost.

01:22:43.359 --> 01:22:45.426
No.

01:22:45.994 --> 01:22:49.196
She'd want to try again.

01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:54.468
I think we both had some things

01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:57.972
we've been putting off
for way too long.

01:23:07.349 --> 01:23:11.085
Say what's in your head.

01:23:12.754 --> 01:23:16.123
I want to see
if I'm good enough.

01:23:17.225 --> 01:23:19.760
But not for her, for me.

01:23:21.162 --> 01:23:24.131
Say what's in your head.

01:23:24.133 --> 01:23:25.699
I want to smash him.

01:23:25.701 --> 01:23:27.134
Good.

01:23:27.136 --> 01:23:29.069
Deserves it.

01:23:32.307 --> 01:23:34.508
But you love him.

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:37.745
But I love him.

01:23:39.114 --> 01:23:40.781
I do feel like I have to go back

01:23:40.783 --> 01:23:44.318
and see what we're willing
to do about that.

01:23:46.454 --> 01:23:49.690
Because I would never
forgive myself

01:23:49.692 --> 01:23:52.593
if I didn't fight for it.

01:23:52.595 --> 01:23:56.130
It's time to stop running,

01:23:56.132 --> 01:23:58.365
but for now,

01:23:58.367 --> 01:24:02.503
let's enjoy this
for a little while longer.

01:25:28.756 --> 01:25:30.858
Nick.

01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:32.526
It's you again.

01:25:32.528 --> 01:25:36.864
Listen, I want to give you
one more piece of advice.

01:25:37.832 --> 01:25:40.400
You're gonna be
playing one night...

01:25:40.402 --> 01:25:42.703
Grand Central... thinking
of every reason in the world

01:25:42.705 --> 01:25:46.773
to not go see the girl
that broke your heart.

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:52.146
Then you're gonna meet somebody.

01:25:52.148 --> 01:25:54.448
And now at first,

01:25:54.450 --> 01:25:58.218
she's gonna seem... icy.

01:25:58.453 --> 01:26:02.856
You're gonna know right away
she's trouble.

01:26:02.858 --> 01:26:04.191
She's gonna take all your money.

01:26:04.193 --> 01:26:07.861
You're probably gonna get
punched in the face.

01:26:07.863 --> 01:26:09.897
But, uh...

01:26:09.899 --> 01:26:11.431
stay with her.

01:26:11.433 --> 01:26:16.236
You're gonna need her a lot more
than she needs you.

01:26:20.542 --> 01:26:22.876
And at the end of the night,
you're gonna want

01:26:22.878 --> 01:26:24.678
to say some things, but don't.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:27.881
Don't ruin it.

01:26:27.883 --> 01:26:32.519
It's nothing she doesn't
already know.

01:26:32.521 --> 01:26:36.623
Just give her a kiss.

01:26:36.625 --> 01:26:40.327
Wish her good luck.

01:26:40.329 --> 01:26:41.895
And, uh...

01:26:41.897 --> 01:26:43.564
thank her.

01:26:43.566 --> 01:26:47.201
Thank her for showing you
that you can love

01:26:47.203 --> 01:26:51.438
more than one person
in this life.

01:26:58.313 --> 01:27:00.280
Oh, wait!

01:27:00.282 --> 01:27:01.949
