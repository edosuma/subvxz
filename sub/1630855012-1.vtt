WEBVTT

02:29.859 --> 02:31.360
Maria.

02:32.736 --> 02:33.988
Mom?

02:35.489 --> 02:36.866
Where are you, Mom?

02:37.366 --> 02:39.410
No, no, Maria!
Mom's not there.

02:39.577 --> 02:41.495
- Maria!
- Mom!

02:43.873 --> 02:44.999
Mom!

02:47.626 --> 02:49.628
Mom! Are you there?

02:50.004 --> 02:51.672
Mommy!

03:33.589 --> 03:34.965
Maria.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.343
Mom?

03:38.594 --> 03:39.720
Mom!

03:52.358 --> 03:54.985
Maria.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.788
Maria.

04:50.374 --> 04:53.085
Let's go!
You bunch of scumbags. Faster!

04:53.502 --> 04:55.004
The unicorns will ram
their horns

04:55.129 --> 04:57.756
so far up your sorry asses,

04:57.840 --> 05:00.509
you'll throw up
every blueberry!

05:00.718 --> 05:04.722
You're trash. The worst group
I've ever seen.

05:04.847 --> 05:06.724
If I let you out on the battlefield,

05:06.849 --> 05:09.977
I assure you,
you wouldn't last a second.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.605
Shame on you!

05:16.108 --> 05:17.860
I want to go home.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.488
Formation! In line!

05:24.116 --> 05:26.869
Good God!
That was pathetic and pitiful, rookies.

05:26.994 --> 05:30.497
How will you survive
in the Magic Forest with that attitude?

05:30.748 --> 05:34.877
I'll personally see to it
that from today on you learn discipline.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.628
This is the Love Camp!

05:36.754 --> 05:38.213
Honor, pain and cuddles!

05:38.338 --> 05:40.090
Honor, pain and cuddles!

06:09.203 --> 06:14.875
Good unicorn, dead unicorn

06:20.297 --> 06:23.717
Gentlemen, take a look.
My proportions are perfect.

06:24.093 --> 06:26.720
Good teeth are a sign
of good health.

06:28.097 --> 06:29.348
Look at my scarf.

06:29.473 --> 06:30.849
It's beautiful!

06:31.100 --> 06:33.977
As soft as the skin of a baby unicorn.

06:34.478 --> 06:37.356
I'm strong
but also tender and fluffy.

06:37.523 --> 06:39.983
My God!
You're so wonderful.

06:40.859 --> 06:43.737
Thanks, dear brother.
You're so silky!

06:57.292 --> 06:59.878
Please,
you're embarrassing us.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.256
Look at you,
you're not at all handsome.

07:02.339 --> 07:05.968
I'm stressed, little brother.
You know I wasn't like this before.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.845
"Before," "before..."

07:08.095 --> 07:11.223
Well now you are neither
handsome nor loving.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.850
Instead...

07:12.975 --> 07:16.061
Instead, look at me.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.732
He's beautiful!

07:21.608 --> 07:24.111
Look at the color of my eyes.

07:24.361 --> 07:27.614
Aquamarine blue.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.494
Hey! You're not that perfect.

07:32.619 --> 07:36.498
Or did you think nobody's noticed
the wrinkles around your eyes?

07:36.874 --> 07:39.334
Yes, he hides them
with make-up every day.

07:39.501 --> 07:43.213
Even if he tries,
you can see still them. They're ugly!

07:48.218 --> 07:51.471
Ugly?
Who's the ugly one now?

07:55.601 --> 07:56.602
Calm down!

08:01.565 --> 08:03.233
He hit me.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.736
He hit me.

08:06.778 --> 08:08.864
I'm done, I'm done.

08:17.664 --> 08:18.832
Little Brother!

08:21.293 --> 08:24.504
Who do you think you are?
You'd better be careful.

08:25.339 --> 08:28.550
Actions have consequences.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.741
What are you worried about, Son?

08:57.496 --> 08:58.997
Nobody understands me.

08:59.122 --> 09:03.627
I only want to be the best,
the best soldier possible.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.339
Cry, Son, cry.

09:07.464 --> 09:10.717
In war, you can cry.
You should cry.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.345
You'll be the best
if you're determined.

09:13.512 --> 09:15.973
You just need a reason to believe,

09:16.139 --> 09:19.726
you need something to hold on to
when things aren't going well.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.147
I did it with this.

09:24.731 --> 09:25.732
For me?

09:25.983 --> 09:27.484
Yes, for you.

09:44.376 --> 09:48.130
Woe to him who drinketh
the blood of the last unicorn,

09:48.213 --> 09:51.717
for he shall become
a beautiful and eternal being.

09:51.842 --> 09:56.221
And so God will return
to the lost paradise.

09:56.346 --> 10:01.727
Only one teddy bear, the chosen one,
can perform such a feat.

10:18.994 --> 10:20.120
Tubby!

10:20.370 --> 10:22.247
Do you think
I'll be the chosen one?

10:22.414 --> 10:25.000
Do you think
I'll be handsome and eternal?

10:25.500 --> 10:28.378
Yeah, Bluey,
of course you will be.

10:48.607 --> 10:49.608
Bluey!

10:49.983 --> 10:51.234
Wake up.

10:52.486 --> 10:53.278
What?

10:53.862 --> 10:56.031
The bed is really wet.

10:58.742 --> 10:59.659
Wow.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.328
Don't worry about it, Tubby.

11:01.620 --> 11:05.165
Take the sheets to the laundry room
and get clean ones.

11:05.374 --> 11:08.502
We can change them
and no one will ever know.

11:09.628 --> 11:12.506
How clever you are.
Thank you for being you.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.341
Here's a cuddly heart for you.

11:14.591 --> 11:17.344
A cuddly heart for you too.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.606
Hey!
Everybody up!

11:31.066 --> 11:34.611
Look! The fat pig, Tubby,
has wet the bed.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.863
He wanted to pretend
it never happened

11:36.988 --> 11:39.241
so he stripped the sheets off.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.451
He wet the bed!

11:43.954 --> 11:45.372
Look everyone!

11:45.872 --> 11:47.833
What's going on in here?

11:48.500 --> 11:50.627
Sir, Recruit Tubby has wet himself.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.504
The bed's covered in wee.

11:52.587 --> 11:55.006
All of it!
Look at all the wee.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.592
Bloody hell! Disgusting!
This can't be true.

11:57.843 --> 11:58.969
That's disgusting!

11:59.344 --> 12:01.388
From now on
we'll call him Bed-wetter!

12:01.596 --> 12:04.349
And we'll put nappies on him
when he goes to bed.

12:12.482 --> 12:13.733
Aim properly!

12:13.984 --> 12:16.236
The best way to kill a unicorn

12:16.361 --> 12:18.238
is to go through its neck.

12:18.488 --> 12:21.241
This way it'll suffer a while
before dying.

12:21.616 --> 12:25.370
We won't win this war
with arrows alone, Sergeant Ironstroke.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.301
Good job, rookie. Good shots.

12:40.010 --> 12:43.221
Too bad they are nothing
compared to his.

12:47.851 --> 12:51.062
Being second is better
than being the best loser.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.231
Congratulations, Coco.

12:53.356 --> 12:55.400
You have proven yourself
to be the best.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.488
Thanks, Sergeant.

13:00.155 --> 13:01.615
Recruits!

13:01.865 --> 13:03.867
I know you admire me.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.453
But I won't always be with you.

13:06.870 --> 13:09.956
A group always needs
an internal leader.

13:10.248 --> 13:11.374
Private Coco.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.752
I'm appointing you
chief of the recruits.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.254
Good!

13:16.588 --> 13:17.923
Great!

13:20.634 --> 13:22.093
Coco is the best!

13:22.219 --> 13:23.970
Yes, the best!

13:57.796 --> 13:59.714
Dad, I saw two fish.

14:00.090 --> 14:04.427
Two, a couple.
Maybe they're brothers, or boyfriends.

14:05.554 --> 14:07.055
Do fish fall in love?

14:07.222 --> 14:08.348
Huh, Dad?

14:08.723 --> 14:10.225
Hey, Dad?

14:10.600 --> 14:13.228
Dad! Do they fall in love?

14:13.728 --> 14:14.729
Son...

14:15.105 --> 14:16.606
love is very complicated.

14:18.733 --> 14:21.611
You see,
I have to tell you something.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.365
It's time you knew about it
since you're old enough now.

14:26.616 --> 14:30.245
Mom and I...
Mom and I are splitting up.

14:30.870 --> 14:31.746
What?

14:33.123 --> 14:34.124
But...

14:34.249 --> 14:35.667
But why?

14:36.376 --> 14:38.128
Is it my fault?

14:39.838 --> 14:42.340
No, honey, not at all.

14:45.343 --> 14:49.472
Sometimes adults stop understanding
each other, that's all.

15:13.371 --> 15:15.999
It's normal that Mommy
doesn't want to be with me.

15:16.374 --> 15:18.001
I'm a failure.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.003
A pathetic failure.

15:27.218 --> 15:30.221
Bluey, don't ever be as mediocre
as your father.

15:33.224 --> 15:36.102
You have to be good, Son.
You have to be the best.

15:36.978 --> 15:40.357
If you're the best,
they'll always respect you.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.118
Mom, look!

15:57.374 --> 15:59.376
Bluey! Baby!

16:04.464 --> 16:07.008
Let's see how many
fish my boy caught.

16:11.221 --> 16:12.597
Won't you give me a kiss?

16:14.599 --> 16:15.975
Don't touch me!

16:41.000 --> 16:47.006
Good unicorn, dead unicorn

16:47.590 --> 16:54.347
Good unicorn, dead unicorn

16:56.099 --> 17:02.731
Good unicorn, dead unicorn

17:05.358 --> 17:10.488
Is it not true that the teddy bear
is God's true creation?

17:10.613 --> 17:14.743
Is it not true that the unicorn stole
our fertile land?

17:14.868 --> 17:18.496
That the sacred forest belonged to us
through divine right?

17:18.747 --> 17:22.000
Is it not true
that the unicorn must die?

17:22.250 --> 17:24.335
Death, death to the unicorn!

17:24.461 --> 17:25.962
Death to the unicorn!

17:26.838 --> 17:29.048
Porridge, dingy porridge!

17:30.341 --> 17:31.718
Come on, eat up!

17:36.598 --> 17:38.600
- It's revolting.
- It's disgusting.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.602
Why don't we get teddy bear food?

17:41.102 --> 17:44.189
Father says the Magic Forest
is full of blueberries.

17:44.355 --> 17:46.691
Yes, blueberries.
We need blueberries!

17:46.858 --> 17:48.943
Blueberries, nectar of the gods!

17:49.110 --> 17:51.404
Blueberries! Blueberries!

17:56.367 --> 17:59.621
Shut up, rookies!
What's all this about?

17:59.746 --> 18:04.000
You are going to eat dingy porridge
until it comes out of your ears!

18:04.125 --> 18:07.253
There are no mammalian cuddles
or affection here!

18:07.337 --> 18:11.758
Here cuddles are made
of steel, blood, and pain!

18:11.925 --> 18:14.844
You're going to learn
what tough love is, recruits.

18:14.969 --> 18:17.597
And you will end up liking it.

18:18.223 --> 18:20.850
Bloody hell!
They're pathetic, Colonel.

18:21.017 --> 18:21.976
They're scumbags.

18:22.101 --> 18:25.230
This is the worst group
I've seen in a long time.

18:25.355 --> 18:28.358
Precisely, Captain Snout.
They're perfect.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.401
They won't be an important loss.

18:31.110 --> 18:35.114
Or perhaps you don't know
the expression "collateral damage"?

18:38.868 --> 18:43.081
This forest is cursed.
How I hate those unicorns.

18:43.373 --> 18:47.627
A person without hatred can never beat
the enemy, Commander Fluffy.

18:48.586 --> 18:51.005
Sir, Sergeant Ironstroke
is already here.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.841
Send him in, Corporal Pompom.

18:56.594 --> 18:59.722
Sir! Sergeant Ironstroke
at your command, Sir.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.725
Relax, Sergeant.
Don't shout in here.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.435
Captain Snout, tell him.

19:04.602 --> 19:07.730
Sergeant, we need you
and your group

19:07.856 --> 19:10.233
for Operation "Missing Bird."

19:10.483 --> 19:13.486
Your group will go
to the northern entrance of the forest.

19:13.611 --> 19:16.990
They'll go in
using the coordinate 17B-12.

19:17.240 --> 19:21.494
Their mission:
find the Lone Owl group.

19:21.619 --> 19:24.247
The soldiers should've returned
days ago.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.126
Bring them back safe and sound.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.963
Let's hope
you don't let us down, Sergeant.

19:32.088 --> 19:34.299
This is your last chance
to be promoted.

19:39.220 --> 19:42.473
Goddamn gunpowder,
you just can't get the hang of it.

19:42.599 --> 19:44.601
Collateral damage....

19:50.356 --> 19:52.233
Peace be with all of you.

19:52.483 --> 19:54.861
Peace be with all of you.

20:01.743 --> 20:03.745
The sacred fire.

20:16.841 --> 20:19.844
My sons,
this chain will protect you.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.096
Here's a cuddly heart for you.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.976
A cuddly heart for you too.

20:28.478 --> 20:31.481
- Get that pendant away from me.
- Hey, guys!

20:31.606 --> 20:32.857
I'm here.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.108
No.

20:34.484 --> 20:37.320
Oh, no!
Is Tubby really coming with us?

20:37.487 --> 20:39.489
Affirmative, Private Snuggle!

20:39.614 --> 20:43.493
We need a pack mule
to carry the material and medicine.

20:43.618 --> 20:45.620
He's fat. Yes, I know.

20:46.120 --> 20:47.372
But he's strong!

20:47.622 --> 20:50.333
He'll slow us down!
Nobody wants him to come.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.336
Pandi, not another word!
He's my brother.

21:04.847 --> 21:08.476
Recruits,
today is a very special day.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.604
The most important day of your lives!

21:12.105 --> 21:13.982
At last, you are soldiers.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.858
You've earned it!

21:16.859 --> 21:18.987
Remember you're not alone,

21:19.112 --> 21:22.490
for you carry the teddy bear people
in your hearts.

21:26.995 --> 21:30.373
I can't guarantee
that we'll all return alive

21:30.498 --> 21:32.875
because the enemy
is cruel and powerful.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.336
But, I can assure you

21:35.586 --> 21:37.964
that while I'm with you,

21:38.089 --> 21:40.967
I'll never abandon you,
symbolically speaking.

21:41.342 --> 21:43.219
Don't ever forget me.

21:43.344 --> 21:44.595
Never, my love.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.768
My children,
this is such a big step in your lives.

21:51.227 --> 21:54.856
Here's a pie made with the last few
blueberries from our garden.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.276
It's your mother's recipe.

21:59.235 --> 22:00.945
I wish she could see you.

22:01.487 --> 22:04.365
Mom would be so proud of you.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.463
Many, many years ago,

22:18.713 --> 22:21.340
the sacred garden shone with holy light,

22:21.466 --> 22:24.594
like the first morning dew.

22:25.219 --> 22:29.599
God created the magical garden,
in his image and likeness

22:29.724 --> 22:31.100
and filled it with flesh.

22:31.225 --> 22:35.605
Flesh that flies, flesh that walks,
flesh that crawls,

22:35.730 --> 22:37.607
and flesh that swims.

22:41.360 --> 22:46.365
All animals lived
as free creatures of nature,

22:46.491 --> 22:48.868
inhabiting paradise.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.997
But one day the teddy bears
discovered God's house,

22:53.247 --> 22:57.251
and inside was the sacred book
on everything.

22:57.960 --> 23:01.255
And thanks to it,
the teddy bears gained knowledge,

23:01.589 --> 23:02.840
progress,

23:03.341 --> 23:04.592
morals,

23:05.093 --> 23:06.469
and laws.

23:07.845 --> 23:10.598
The teddy bears were now
superior to the other animals,

23:10.723 --> 23:13.726
as they had found God.

23:15.353 --> 23:18.106
But the unicorns, envious demons,

23:18.481 --> 23:21.109
decided to declare war
on the chosen people.

23:22.235 --> 23:24.737
And so began the Holy War.

23:24.987 --> 23:29.158
A bloodthirsty war
of death, hatred, and pain.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.872
The teddy bears
were finally defeated,

23:34.997 --> 23:39.085
and the survivors were expelled
from paradise forever.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.712
Condemned to wander aimlessly,

23:41.879 --> 23:44.966
humiliated and harassed
as a community.

23:45.341 --> 23:48.719
Bearing the stigma of defeat forever.

23:49.220 --> 23:52.974
Woe to him who drinketh
the blood of the last unicorn

23:53.099 --> 23:56.102
for he will become
a beautiful and eternal being.

23:56.352 --> 24:00.606
And so God will return
to the lost paradise.

25:12.220 --> 25:13.721
I'm starving.

25:14.263 --> 25:16.140
Yesterday porridge and today porridge.

25:16.307 --> 25:18.226
And tomorrow porridge...

25:18.851 --> 25:21.646
Didn't the Father say
the forest was full of blueberries?

25:21.812 --> 25:23.606
Yes, blueberries.

25:24.106 --> 25:27.610
Take it easy, guys.
This misery will soon be over.

25:31.948 --> 25:36.369
Wow! How pretty.
This place is magical.

25:37.495 --> 25:38.621
Tubby.

25:39.747 --> 25:41.874
My feet are messed up.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.377
These boots are killing me.

25:44.585 --> 25:47.213
They're too hard on my delicate feet.

25:48.839 --> 25:50.841
Oh, that's so nice!

26:05.481 --> 26:07.483
Hey! Don't look at my willy.

26:07.858 --> 26:10.027
- What?
- Don't look at my willy!

26:10.736 --> 26:13.239
You were standing at an angle
so you could see it.

26:13.739 --> 26:16.492
- You like looking at it?
- No, not at all!

26:16.742 --> 26:17.660
Never!

26:17.785 --> 26:19.245
Yes, you do.

26:20.997 --> 26:21.998
Snuggle!

26:23.291 --> 26:24.375
What's wrong?

26:24.709 --> 26:26.460
Something bit my foot.

26:27.837 --> 26:29.714
It hurts so much!

26:33.718 --> 26:34.468
Tubby...

26:34.719 --> 26:35.720
What?

26:35.970 --> 26:39.098
I mean, if you want to,
you can see my willy.

26:41.726 --> 26:45.187
No! No, no, no, no! No! No!

26:45.354 --> 26:46.272
Tubby...

26:46.647 --> 26:47.606
Tubby...

26:48.482 --> 26:49.483
Tubby...

27:12.214 --> 27:13.049
Look!

27:13.341 --> 27:15.968
The Lone Owl group
passed through here.

27:57.927 --> 28:01.722
Please wait, I need to stop.

28:03.599 --> 28:06.143
Private Snuggle!
Get up, right now!

28:06.477 --> 28:10.022
I can't, Sergeant Ironstroke.
My foot hurts so much!

28:10.189 --> 28:13.984
Shame on you.
War waits for no one, get up!

28:14.235 --> 28:16.112
I can't, look.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.241
Soldiers, pit stop.

28:31.085 --> 28:33.087
Rub it, pat it, stroke it

28:33.212 --> 28:36.465
Three days of sunshine,
three days of rain

28:36.715 --> 28:40.344
The little foot will be well again

28:42.096 --> 28:43.097
Come on.

28:43.848 --> 28:45.099
Come on, come here.

28:54.608 --> 28:55.734
You're so cute.

29:11.584 --> 29:13.210
Hey! Hey!

29:14.962 --> 29:16.338
Look how cute they are.

29:16.714 --> 29:19.216
Don't let them get away,
they're so slippery.

29:19.383 --> 29:21.719
Oh my God!
I'm starting to drool.

29:21.969 --> 29:23.345
Well done, Private Bluey.

29:23.471 --> 29:25.306
We all needed something like this.

29:25.473 --> 29:28.100
Yes! It's finally party time tonight.

29:28.976 --> 29:30.603
Myriapoda!

29:31.312 --> 29:33.981
Leave that creature alone.
It's a drug.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.107
A drug?

29:36.859 --> 29:38.736
The sacred book forbids it!

29:38.861 --> 29:41.739
"You will not consume
forbidden colored meats,

29:41.864 --> 29:43.365
they're the fruit of the devil!"

29:43.491 --> 29:45.743
Shut up, Father!

29:45.868 --> 29:49.497
Enough with
your religious prayers and gibberish.

29:49.997 --> 29:53.209
These soldiers are fucked up.
Look at them!

29:53.584 --> 29:55.836
God can back off tonight.

29:55.961 --> 29:58.088
God can't, not ever!

29:58.214 --> 29:59.465
What lack of morality.

30:00.841 --> 30:03.344
The chain's still waiting for you.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.596
You're not worthy of God's love.

30:05.721 --> 30:07.056
That's enough!

30:07.223 --> 30:09.433
There is no God in this place.

30:09.600 --> 30:13.103
We're in a war, a bloody war!

30:13.229 --> 30:14.438
Let go of me!

30:14.605 --> 30:17.107
Listen, you're getting on my nerves.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.610
And you know
when I get nervous,

30:19.735 --> 30:21.737
my knife gets nervous.

30:22.738 --> 30:24.698
You see how it shakes?
You see?

30:24.865 --> 30:25.866
No!

30:27.243 --> 30:30.371
I'm very crazy, Father.
Very crazy.

30:30.621 --> 30:33.123
Calm down, Sergeant!

30:33.290 --> 30:34.291
Please!

30:35.209 --> 30:37.461
There's no God here.
I'm in charge here.

30:37.586 --> 30:40.256
Calm down, please.
Let's calm down.

30:43.342 --> 30:46.095
Hey Father,
where is your God now?

31:24.341 --> 31:26.093
They taste like metal!

31:27.261 --> 31:30.180
Dead unicorn

31:47.364 --> 31:49.867
I don't think I feel so well.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.499
Let's go to the forest!

32:03.505 --> 32:04.548
Brother.

32:05.966 --> 32:06.967
Brother!

32:08.594 --> 32:10.596
It's time for me to go...

32:10.846 --> 32:11.847
Alone.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.727
No, don't leave me.

32:18.729 --> 32:19.980
Cuddly-Wuddly!

32:20.481 --> 32:21.482
Cuddly-Wuddly!

32:25.736 --> 32:28.238
Who wants some holy wine?

32:30.616 --> 32:32.868
It's a treat from our spiritual guide.

32:42.711 --> 32:45.839
Please, somebody help me!

32:45.964 --> 32:47.925
Please!

32:49.343 --> 32:51.679
Please, help!

32:51.970 --> 32:54.264
Help!

32:57.226 --> 32:59.061
Rub it, pat it, stroke it

32:59.228 --> 33:01.605
Three days sunshine,
three days rain...

33:01.730 --> 33:04.983
Forgive them, God, for they don't know
what they are doing.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.493
Little brother!

33:15.244 --> 33:16.870
Where are you?

33:20.332 --> 33:21.709
Cuddly-Wuddly!

33:22.710 --> 33:24.086
Cuddly-Wuddly!

34:25.981 --> 34:27.483
Hey, Sergeant!

34:27.983 --> 34:29.610
There is a problem.

34:30.235 --> 34:33.822
The Cuddly-Wuddly twins are missing.
They're not here!

34:36.742 --> 34:38.702
Cuddly-Wuddly!

34:39.787 --> 34:41.914
Cuddly-Wuddly!

34:43.457 --> 34:45.083
Hey!

34:45.250 --> 34:47.711
Where are you?

34:48.962 --> 34:50.839
Where are you?

34:54.218 --> 34:56.136
Cuddly-Wuddly!

34:58.013 --> 34:59.681
Cuddly-Wuddly!

35:13.654 --> 35:16.240
Here, here! Oh my God!

35:18.617 --> 35:19.868
He's dead!

35:20.244 --> 35:21.245
Oh, no!

35:22.621 --> 35:26.124
These wounds are from an army knife,
Sergeant.

35:27.125 --> 35:27.960
Look!

35:28.085 --> 35:30.087
One of the Cuddly-Wuddly's boots.

35:49.481 --> 35:52.359
Do you see, Son?
God can never wait.

35:52.609 --> 35:53.610
I warned you.

35:53.861 --> 35:55.237
The book warned you.

35:55.362 --> 35:57.614
The sacred book that you desecrated,

35:57.739 --> 36:01.743
that you spat on and rejected
before God, the almighty Father.

36:02.119 --> 36:04.246
- No!
- It's your fault!

36:04.371 --> 36:06.874
You're not worthy
of bowing down before God.

36:06.957 --> 36:07.833
I didn't know.

36:08.584 --> 36:10.669
- You're not worthy.
- I'm not worthy.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.462
You're not worthy!

36:12.754 --> 36:14.548
You're not worthy!

36:14.715 --> 36:17.718
I'm not worthy!

36:18.719 --> 36:22.347
God, forgive me.
Forgive me!

36:36.111 --> 36:38.614
Death does not take everything.

36:38.989 --> 36:40.616
It only takes one part:

36:40.741 --> 36:45.495
the bad part,
bad memories, bad behavior...

36:46.246 --> 36:49.458
And death does not rob us
of our loved ones.

36:49.583 --> 36:50.709
In fact,

36:50.959 --> 36:54.588
it keeps them and
immortalizes them in our memories.

36:54.838 --> 36:58.592
Every death is the beginning of a life.
But what is death?

36:58.717 --> 37:01.720
We barely know what life is.

37:51.353 --> 37:53.605
We'll be at the Lone Owl camp soon.

37:53.730 --> 37:55.190
Hang on.

37:55.357 --> 37:58.360
The sooner the better, Father.
The sooner the better.

38:07.494 --> 38:10.122
Sergeant! Is something wrong?

38:11.331 --> 38:13.959
Look! He' still high.

38:14.126 --> 38:17.295
Yeah, look at his eyes.
He's seeing things.

38:41.486 --> 38:43.739
Father, why are you here?

38:44.114 --> 38:45.991
Why did you come with us?

38:46.116 --> 38:48.493
God is everywhere.
He's here, my son.

38:48.744 --> 38:50.620
He's in the war too.

38:52.247 --> 38:54.750
Not all of the Magic Forest
is beautiful.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.085
Just like us, it's also sick.

38:57.210 --> 39:00.464
Infecting everything around it.

39:06.470 --> 39:09.097
By the Sacred Cuddly Heart!

39:09.222 --> 39:10.474
Oh my God!

39:24.362 --> 39:26.239
No, please!

39:27.449 --> 39:29.743
Father, what happened here?

39:30.243 --> 39:32.204
The unicorn, my children.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.748
The beast has no mercy.

39:40.337 --> 39:43.965
Children, take a good look
at what we're fighting.

39:44.216 --> 39:46.593
And what are we fighting?
Tell us.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.471
We haven't even seen
a damn unicorn yet.

39:49.596 --> 39:51.348
This is a slaughterhouse!

39:51.473 --> 39:52.891
You have to have faith.

39:53.475 --> 39:55.352
But what madness is this war?

39:55.477 --> 39:56.978
Look around you, Father.

39:57.229 --> 40:00.232
Having faith means
not wanting to know the truth.

40:00.357 --> 40:02.109
This makes no sense.

40:03.110 --> 40:04.486
Let's go home!

40:04.861 --> 40:07.364
Oh my God!

40:07.489 --> 40:09.366
We're all going to die.

40:09.616 --> 40:12.160
We're all going to die.

40:12.494 --> 40:14.246
The Sergeant is right.

40:14.496 --> 40:16.373
We're going to die.

40:24.464 --> 40:27.467
Hey! Please help!

40:27.592 --> 40:31.346
Snuggle isn't doing well.
He can't take any more!

40:35.475 --> 40:36.726
Help!

40:36.977 --> 40:39.980
Help me, Coco, please!

40:40.105 --> 40:42.858
Put me out of my misery.

42:12.864 --> 42:14.241
Good morning, little mouse.

42:14.574 --> 42:16.368
Have you seen my mom?

42:16.785 --> 42:19.663
No, I'm sorry.
I haven't seen her today.

42:25.835 --> 42:27.963
Come on.
Come on, everybody.

42:41.726 --> 42:43.853
Come on, catch me if you can.

43:01.329 --> 43:03.999
Let's go, honey.
It's already late.

43:04.582 --> 43:08.211
Come on, Mommy!
Let me play a bit more with Maria.

43:08.336 --> 43:09.838
No, let's go.

43:14.843 --> 43:18.555
Maria, go home right now.
You shouldn't wander off so far.

43:19.472 --> 43:21.474
The forest is very dangerous now.

43:21.975 --> 43:23.601
Why don't you come with us?

43:23.977 --> 43:28.106
No, I am waiting for my mom.
I am sure she'll be back soon.

43:34.612 --> 43:38.366
Mommy, why is Maria alone?
Did she misbehave?

43:38.867 --> 43:40.243
Let's go, honey.

43:41.494 --> 43:43.121
But did she misbehave?

43:43.330 --> 43:44.247
Why?

43:44.331 --> 43:45.832
Did she misbehave?

43:45.957 --> 43:47.083
Mom?

43:47.208 --> 43:48.335
Mom?

44:34.589 --> 44:35.590
Mom!

44:41.971 --> 44:43.306
Is that you?

44:45.100 --> 44:46.351
My baby!

44:47.727 --> 44:49.604
Mom, where were you?

44:49.729 --> 44:51.981
I saw you in that horrible stone place.

44:52.232 --> 44:54.692
Then a black monster came and...

44:54.859 --> 44:57.362
Honey, the forest
is now full of dangers

44:57.612 --> 44:59.239
that we can't understand.

44:59.364 --> 45:00.865
I missed you so much.

45:00.990 --> 45:03.118
I thought you'd abandoned me.

45:03.493 --> 45:06.496
Maria, I will never leave you.

45:06.746 --> 45:11.126
But there comes a time in life
when adults must leave their children.

45:11.584 --> 45:13.086
It's just how it is.

45:13.962 --> 45:17.215
But what am I going to do without you?
You're my mom.

45:17.465 --> 45:18.967
No, I'm not.

45:19.467 --> 45:22.095
Nature is our mother,
our true mother.

45:22.220 --> 45:26.599
We get our nourishment from her
and she gets her nourishment from us.

45:26.724 --> 45:30.603
We have to look after her.
We have to look after the forest.

45:30.728 --> 45:33.481
Soon you will also have to leave.

45:33.606 --> 45:35.358
You have to be brave.

45:35.483 --> 45:36.734
I love you.

45:39.362 --> 45:42.115
No, Mom, don't go. No!

45:42.365 --> 45:43.867
Don't leave me!

45:43.992 --> 45:44.993
No!

47:45.363 --> 47:46.739
Attack!

48:20.982 --> 48:22.483
Damn unicorns!

48:22.609 --> 48:24.986
Yeah, let's drink their blood.

48:29.741 --> 48:31.367
What's happening?

48:35.580 --> 48:37.248
Oh no, they're getting closer!

48:39.959 --> 48:41.711
Oh my God!

48:45.340 --> 48:47.717
May God protect us!

48:50.219 --> 48:52.055
Hurry, in position!

48:54.974 --> 48:55.975
Aim!

48:58.728 --> 48:59.729
Now!

49:24.337 --> 49:25.838
Tubby!

49:38.017 --> 49:41.813
In the name of God,
may you have eternal glory.

49:48.486 --> 49:50.238
Be strong, my children.

49:50.613 --> 49:52.490
No! Father!

50:22.603 --> 50:24.105
Wait!

50:24.230 --> 50:25.857
I need to stop.

50:28.109 --> 50:29.318
It hurts a lot.

50:30.611 --> 50:33.239
Wait, let me help you.

50:42.206 --> 50:44.834
See what your medal is for?

50:46.210 --> 50:47.462
Stop!

50:53.593 --> 50:56.095
He's in bad shape.
What are we going to do?

50:56.345 --> 50:58.765
Leave him here.
We have to go.

50:58.973 --> 51:00.099
No!

51:00.224 --> 51:03.352
Come on, let's go.
Just you and me.

51:03.478 --> 51:05.897
Always together like Mom used to say.

51:06.230 --> 51:08.441
Look at him, he's already dead.

51:08.608 --> 51:11.486
Although you can see him,
he doesn't exist anymore.

51:11.611 --> 51:13.070
Isn't that true?

51:13.237 --> 51:15.072
Aren't you dead already?

51:20.161 --> 51:23.915
Actions have consequences,
remember?

51:25.458 --> 51:26.751
No! No!

51:27.210 --> 51:28.711
What have you done?

51:30.379 --> 51:31.506
No! No!

51:35.092 --> 51:36.219
No...

53:07.310 --> 53:08.477
It was dark.

53:09.353 --> 53:11.606
I remember they were
the worst minutes of my life.

53:11.731 --> 53:13.649
There, alone, abandoned.

53:13.858 --> 53:15.484
It went on forever.

53:32.710 --> 53:34.462
He was already there.

53:34.587 --> 53:37.340
Those minutes gave him
an advantage over me.

53:37.590 --> 53:38.966
I always...

53:39.467 --> 53:40.885
came second.

55:01.090 --> 55:02.967
I know you're there, okay?

55:08.347 --> 55:10.224
Go away.
I don't want to see you.

55:10.474 --> 55:11.726
I hate you!

55:13.352 --> 55:14.353
I'm hungry.

55:21.610 --> 55:23.612
See how you love me?

55:26.365 --> 55:27.241
Be careful.

55:27.491 --> 55:29.869
Don't drink too much,
otherwise you'll wee.

55:29.994 --> 55:31.245
Hey, bed-wetter.

55:32.455 --> 55:34.832
You are the one
who wets the bed at night.

55:37.626 --> 55:40.588
From now on,
you'll treat me with respect.

55:40.713 --> 55:43.090
Or are you going to kill me too?

55:43.632 --> 55:44.550
What?

55:44.717 --> 55:46.093
How can you say that?

55:46.218 --> 55:50.222
How can you treat
your brother like that? I did it for us.

55:50.473 --> 55:52.975
Something's wrong with you.
Mom used to say that.

55:53.476 --> 55:54.977
Do not mention Mom.

55:55.352 --> 55:56.729
I loved her more.

55:56.854 --> 55:59.190
You're a manipulator
and always have been.

55:59.356 --> 56:01.358
At least I'm not a murderer.

56:01.609 --> 56:02.902
What did you say?

56:43.109 --> 56:44.360
Mom, look!

56:48.989 --> 56:50.491
Thank you, Son.

56:51.367 --> 56:53.119
Use the rolling pin to roll it out.

56:53.244 --> 56:54.870
- Like this?
- Good job.

57:03.963 --> 57:05.089
Mom!

57:05.756 --> 57:07.466
Mom! Mom!

57:09.135 --> 57:10.261
Mom! Mom!

57:10.469 --> 57:11.846
What is it?

57:12.096 --> 57:13.597
What's happening to you?

57:19.270 --> 57:20.271
Honey,

57:21.730 --> 57:23.190
promise me one thing.

57:24.859 --> 57:26.360
Take care of your brother,

57:26.735 --> 57:28.487
he needs you.

57:28.988 --> 57:31.991
You must love him
and protect him.

57:33.742 --> 57:35.119
Promise me.

57:35.244 --> 57:37.872
Promise me, Tubby.

57:51.719 --> 57:53.846
Bluey.

58:03.856 --> 58:05.983
Bluey.

58:17.828 --> 58:19.955
Bluey.

58:24.501 --> 58:26.587
Bluey.

1:00:11.108 --> 1:00:12.609
Dig properly.

1:00:13.235 --> 1:00:16.363
You'll see,
later we can make a blueberry pie.

1:00:16.488 --> 1:00:19.241
Yay, blueberries!

1:00:19.867 --> 1:00:23.120
Spring is when you plant the seeds.

1:00:23.329 --> 1:00:24.955
Only in the spring, Mommy?

1:00:26.707 --> 1:00:29.043
"Only in the spring, Mommy?"

1:00:50.230 --> 1:00:53.984
Your brother is not well.
He always wants to be alone.

1:00:55.611 --> 1:00:57.738
I don't know
what to do with this child.

1:01:00.115 --> 1:01:01.367
It's so hot.

1:01:01.992 --> 1:01:05.245
Bluey, could you bring me
a glass of lemonade please?

1:01:05.329 --> 1:01:07.456
Yes, Mom!

1:01:15.714 --> 1:01:16.965
There you go.

1:01:55.212 --> 1:01:57.714
Listen, Bluey, a big river!

1:01:58.590 --> 1:02:00.467
It will lead us out of here.

1:02:15.232 --> 1:02:18.235
There's a blueberry bush.
It's humongous.

1:02:22.197 --> 1:02:23.240
Let's go.

1:02:23.740 --> 1:02:25.242
You can come closer.

1:02:30.706 --> 1:02:32.833
How enormous they are!

1:02:32.958 --> 1:02:36.086
These blueberries are blueberrylicious!

1:02:39.965 --> 1:02:41.341
They are everywhere.

1:03:54.373 --> 1:03:55.749
No! No!

1:04:44.840 --> 1:04:46.550
Oh, no! No!

1:04:46.717 --> 1:04:47.968
Bluey!

1:04:50.345 --> 1:04:51.722
No...

1:04:56.852 --> 1:04:57.978
Bluey!

1:04:58.353 --> 1:04:59.730
Bluey!

1:05:00.606 --> 1:05:02.858
Bluey, where are you?

1:05:03.108 --> 1:05:04.985
Bluey, oh my God!

1:05:07.487 --> 1:05:08.864
Bluey!

1:05:11.116 --> 1:05:13.243
Bluey!

1:05:22.586 --> 1:05:25.088
Corporal Pompom,
I can't take it anymore.

1:05:25.213 --> 1:05:26.965
I'm exhausted, Sir.

1:05:27.174 --> 1:05:30.218
We have to watch the border,
Private Furry.

1:05:30.385 --> 1:05:31.261
Of course.

1:05:31.845 --> 1:05:34.348
The colonel and high-ranking
commanders are resting

1:05:34.598 --> 1:05:37.184
and eating chickens
in their golden cage.

1:06:25.857 --> 1:06:27.484
Hey!

1:06:50.841 --> 1:06:52.342
Hello, Son.

1:06:52.968 --> 1:06:54.845
It's warm in here.

1:06:55.470 --> 1:06:56.972
How do you feel today?

1:07:00.225 --> 1:07:01.351
Did you bring it?

1:07:02.978 --> 1:07:05.772
The doctors say
you'll soon be able to walk.

1:07:06.356 --> 1:07:08.608
Did you bring it for me?

1:07:16.992 --> 1:07:18.243
Does it hurt anymore?

1:07:18.827 --> 1:07:20.829
Yes, my soul does.

1:07:22.706 --> 1:07:24.332
Time heals everything.

1:07:26.585 --> 1:07:27.711
And my face?

1:07:27.961 --> 1:07:29.171
Will my face heal?

1:07:29.588 --> 1:07:31.423
Being alive is a gift from God.

1:07:32.215 --> 1:07:34.593
Your poor brother wasn't so lucky.

1:07:51.735 --> 1:07:55.489
And whoever drinks
the blood of the last unicorn

1:07:55.614 --> 1:07:58.992
will become beautiful and eternal.

1:07:59.117 --> 1:08:02.621
This way,
God will return to Lost Paradise.

1:08:10.837 --> 1:08:12.214
Soldier Bluey.

1:08:12.714 --> 1:08:15.467
We are very sorry
about what happened.

1:08:15.592 --> 1:08:17.469
Yes, it's collateral damage.

1:08:17.969 --> 1:08:20.555
The army thanks you for your service.

1:08:21.097 --> 1:08:24.726
We would like you
to have a position as a military bear.

1:08:25.101 --> 1:08:27.729
Yes, we think you really deserve it.

1:08:28.480 --> 1:08:30.190
We'll name you Lieutenant.

1:08:30.482 --> 1:08:31.858
It is a good position.

1:08:32.359 --> 1:08:35.111
The army needs symbols like you.

1:08:36.738 --> 1:08:39.115
Me? But my face?

1:08:40.617 --> 1:08:43.119
We have a gift for you.

1:08:51.711 --> 1:08:54.339
From time to time,
you can have a blueberry.

1:08:55.715 --> 1:08:58.134
You'll be one of us, a leader.

1:08:58.593 --> 1:09:01.471
What do you think,
Lieutenant Bluey?

1:12:28.595 --> 1:12:29.929
That was pathetic.

1:12:30.096 --> 1:12:32.849
You won't get anywhere in the army.

1:12:33.850 --> 1:12:35.393
Good shot, soldier.

1:12:36.478 --> 1:12:38.897
What? He's not the best.

1:12:39.230 --> 1:12:43.359
Corporal Pompom, in the Magic Forest,
being the best won't do you any good.

1:12:43.651 --> 1:12:46.362
The best is not always the strongest.

1:12:47.614 --> 1:12:51.201
Bluey is a great soldier.
He knows the forest by heart.

1:12:51.409 --> 1:12:53.286
We can trust him.

1:12:55.705 --> 1:12:57.707
It is said that Lieutenant Bluey

1:12:57.832 --> 1:13:00.585
killed seven unicorns
in the Magic Forest

1:13:00.835 --> 1:13:02.712
and then drank their blood.

1:13:02.837 --> 1:13:04.464
He's a hero.

1:13:07.592 --> 1:13:10.136
Good unicorn, dead unicorn

1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:11.846
You see, Captain?

1:13:11.971 --> 1:13:15.850
It's always good to create false heroes,
idols with clay feet.

1:13:17.227 --> 1:13:20.980
They make soldiers believe
they, too, can be one.

1:13:23.024 --> 1:13:25.527
Lieutenant Bluey, we can't do it.

1:13:25.860 --> 1:13:28.238
It's forbidden.

1:13:28.488 --> 1:13:31.741
Captain, the forest is the disease.

1:13:31.950 --> 1:13:33.576
Let's eradicate the disease.

1:13:34.202 --> 1:13:36.830
Lieutenant Bluey is delirious.

1:13:37.372 --> 1:13:41.126
As long as there is war
we'll maintain our power.

1:13:41.584 --> 1:13:43.837
Don't you understand?
It is the basis of the army.

1:13:46.214 --> 1:13:48.967
Colonel, you're old and worn out.

1:13:49.092 --> 1:13:52.095
Tell me, how long
have you spent in the forest?

1:13:52.220 --> 1:13:53.096
Do you know?

1:13:53.263 --> 1:13:55.723
- How dare you?
- How dare I?

1:13:56.099 --> 1:13:57.475
The forest did this to me.

1:13:58.434 --> 1:14:00.103
Look me in the eye.

1:14:00.353 --> 1:14:04.107
That place is not paradise.
Believe me, it's hell.

1:14:04.607 --> 1:14:06.693
Who are you
to talk to me like that?

1:14:12.115 --> 1:14:13.491
Lieutenant Bluey.

1:14:13.575 --> 1:14:14.617
Lieutenant Bluey.

1:14:20.456 --> 1:14:22.083
Hey, what is this?

1:14:24.586 --> 1:14:25.587
No!

1:14:33.595 --> 1:14:35.847
Sir, it's done.

1:14:39.601 --> 1:14:41.978
What should we do now, Sir?

1:14:43.229 --> 1:14:44.355
Prepare the army.

1:14:45.273 --> 1:14:48.860
The sacred war has begun.

1:15:23.853 --> 1:15:26.356
Death!
Death to the unicorns!

1:15:41.829 --> 1:15:45.083
Death!
Death to the unicorns!

1:15:56.594 --> 1:15:58.346
It's war.

1:15:59.222 --> 1:16:00.974
The time has come.

1:16:01.474 --> 1:16:04.352
And the Simians?
Should we ask them for help?

1:16:04.852 --> 1:16:06.854
They will never join our side.

1:16:06.980 --> 1:16:10.608
They don't behave
like the other animals in the forest.

1:16:13.111 --> 1:16:14.737
They worship an idol

1:16:14.988 --> 1:16:17.240
who is not good for nature.

1:16:17.490 --> 1:16:18.992
He doesn't have a form yet.

1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:22.704
Evil will eventually destroy the world.

1:16:46.894 --> 1:16:48.855
Everything is lost.

1:16:49.605 --> 1:16:52.233
The forest is bleeding.

1:17:11.586 --> 1:17:13.463
Let's go to war.

1:17:20.094 --> 1:17:22.096
We are the forest

1:17:22.472 --> 1:17:24.724
and we'll die with the forest.

1:17:47.830 --> 1:17:50.833
Good unicorn, dead unicorn

1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:54.087
Good unicorn, dead unicorn

1:17:55.838 --> 1:17:57.465
Quickly, to your posts!

1:18:01.010 --> 1:18:03.054
Not yet. Wait!

1:18:09.602 --> 1:18:10.603
Wait!

1:18:11.229 --> 1:18:12.480
Arrows!

1:18:21.114 --> 1:18:22.615
Grenades!

1:18:46.597 --> 1:18:48.724
Don't back down!
Attack!

1:19:14.584 --> 1:19:15.960
Be careful!

1:20:03.466 --> 1:20:04.342
Fire!

1:20:18.856 --> 1:20:20.066
No!

1:22:18.100 --> 1:22:19.852
Stay away! Who are you?

1:22:26.984 --> 1:22:27.985
Tubby...

1:22:28.736 --> 1:22:30.363
Don't you recognize me?

1:22:33.824 --> 1:22:35.576
Little brother.

1:22:41.457 --> 1:22:42.958
Bluey!

1:22:59.350 --> 1:23:01.977
Poor thing.
What have you done?

1:23:02.978 --> 1:23:03.854
Look...

1:23:04.355 --> 1:23:05.606
Look at my face.

1:23:05.856 --> 1:23:07.358
I'm a monster.

1:23:07.608 --> 1:23:09.360
I've always been one.

1:23:09.860 --> 1:23:13.614
It was my fault,
it was all my fault!

1:23:35.970 --> 1:23:38.222
It's okay, you'll get better.

1:24:14.467 --> 1:24:15.593
No...

1:24:16.343 --> 1:24:17.511
No...
