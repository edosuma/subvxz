01:21.081 --> 01:22.651
Can you not see?

01:22.682 --> 01:25.754
What egregious of fence
have I committed now, Carlo?

01:25.785 --> 01:29.255
I am standing right here,
but you refuse to look at me.

01:29.289 --> 01:31.701
I did no such thing!

01:31.758 --> 01:34.796
You are singing of your love for me,

01:34.828 --> 01:36.205
but you are paying no attention.

01:36.262 --> 01:37.764
Don't be ridiculous.

01:37.797 --> 01:39.777
Fine, sing without me.

01:39.799 --> 01:41.710
No. Clearly I'm at fault.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.441
I will leave.

01:43.470 --> 01:45.609
Rosa, no.

01:45.638 --> 01:47.845
Both of you, please!

01:47.874 --> 01:49.353
Stop!

01:49.375 --> 01:51.377
Rosa!

01:51.444 --> 01:53.947
Mannaggia!

01:53.980 --> 01:57.325
Elvira, please take
over and let us continue.

01:57.350 --> 01:59.057
Of course, Signore Arturo.

02:32.719 --> 02:35.325
Are you all right? Bella!

02:37.056 --> 02:38.558
Oh!

02:38.591 --> 02:40.502
Elvira, what's wrong?

02:40.527 --> 02:41.505
Elvira!

02:41.528 --> 02:43.030
What?

02:43.062 --> 02:44.166
Vi...

02:44.197 --> 02:45.904
ola.

02:45.932 --> 02:48.538
What? What did she say?

02:48.568 --> 02:50.844
Elvira, bella! Oh, no!

02:57.777 --> 02:59.188
Poison.

02:59.212 --> 03:01.021
So it would seem, George.

03:01.047 --> 03:03.584
Dr. Grace will complete her
analysis back at the morgue.

03:03.616 --> 03:05.789
The victim was Elvira Cummings, sir.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.456
She was in the chorus

03:07.520 --> 03:10.558
and also served as
understudy to Rosa Hamilton,

03:10.590 --> 03:13.127
who plays the lead role of Mimi.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.901
According to the impresario, Signor Arturo,

03:15.929 --> 03:17.909
the company is originally from New York,

03:17.931 --> 03:21.902
touring here with their
production of La Bo-heem.

03:21.935 --> 03:24.245
La Boheme, George.

03:24.270 --> 03:25.806
Gather everything the
victim may have touched

03:25.872 --> 03:27.977
and bring it back to the station, please.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.213
Sir.

03:31.744 --> 03:35.749
Did anyone see Miss Cummings eat or drink

03:35.782 --> 03:37.159
prior to collapsing?

03:37.217 --> 03:38.662
She was drinking red wine.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.129
Prop red wine.

03:40.153 --> 03:43.600
We all were, but she had no reaction.

03:43.623 --> 03:44.931
Did she eat?

03:44.958 --> 03:46.631
I don't think so.

03:46.659 --> 03:49.435
Detective, Elvira did
drink from Rosa's glass,

03:49.462 --> 03:51.499
just before she collapsed.

03:51.564 --> 03:53.669
Is this true?

03:53.733 --> 03:56.145
Yes, but Rosa also drank
from the same glass.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.170
It could not be poisoned.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.148
No, Carlo.

03:59.172 --> 04:03.177
You poured the wine, but
I didn't drink from it.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.154
Are you quite sure, Madame Hamilton?

04:05.178 --> 04:07.124
Of course, I'm sure.

04:07.146 --> 04:10.286
So only Miss Cummings
drank from your glass.

04:10.316 --> 04:12.922
What are you saying, Detective?

04:12.952 --> 04:16.695
Perhaps the poison wasn't
meant for Miss Cummings

04:16.755 --> 04:18.463
but for you, Madame Hamilton.

04:18.491 --> 04:22.200
But who would want to kill me?

04:38.378 --> 04:40.324
Oi. There you go.

04:53.059 --> 04:55.300
Mr. Peters.

04:55.328 --> 04:58.241
You prepared the wine backstage, yes?

04:58.298 --> 05:00.904
I'm responsible for
props for all the actors.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.846
And all of the actors
drank from the same carafe?

05:03.870 --> 05:05.315
Yes.

05:05.338 --> 05:07.682
Who pours the wine into the glasses?

05:07.707 --> 05:09.243
The actors themselves.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.220
It's a scene at the bohemian cafe.

05:11.244 --> 05:12.723
They are eating and drinking freely.

05:12.745 --> 05:14.418
I see.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.551
So you set the wine glasses on the tables

05:16.582 --> 05:18.220
for the performance.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.855
Did you examine them?

05:19.886 --> 05:21.263
Well, yes.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.824
I saw nothing untoward, Detective.

05:25.425 --> 05:27.701
Come on, out the way!

05:29.829 --> 05:33.436
Detective Murdoch, it's terrible.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.773
Terrible!

05:34.834 --> 05:36.177
I came as soon as I heard, Murdoch.

05:36.202 --> 05:37.840
Glad you arrived so promptly.

05:37.870 --> 05:42.216
Ah, Signor Arturo, this
is Inspector Brackenreid.

05:42.241 --> 05:44.517
You're in good hands. This is my best man.

05:44.544 --> 05:49.357
Inspector Brackenreid,
may I introduce to you

05:49.382 --> 05:53.125
la diva, Madame Rosa Hamilton.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.756
Inspector.

05:54.787 --> 05:58.360
Such a pleasure, Madame Hamilton.

05:58.391 --> 06:00.632
I've followed your career
since your stunning debut

06:00.693 --> 06:01.637
at the Paris opera.

06:01.694 --> 06:02.764
You were there?

06:02.795 --> 06:05.298
I read the notices. I'm very familiar.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.437
A fan. How enchanting.

06:08.468 --> 06:10.414
And a man of some refinement.

06:10.436 --> 06:12.313
I believe in keeping up appearances,

06:12.372 --> 06:14.374
especially in the colonies.

06:14.407 --> 06:16.785
I can assure you that the
Toronto Police Department

06:16.809 --> 06:20.120
will get to the bottom of
these disturbing events.

06:22.615 --> 06:25.892
We are all available for
your questions, Inspector.

06:25.918 --> 06:28.489
I will be resting in my dressing room.

06:28.554 --> 06:29.726
Of course.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.736
Please, excuse us.

06:33.426 --> 06:36.305
It appears our victim, Elvira...

06:36.329 --> 06:37.899
Sir'?

06:37.930 --> 06:39.500
What?

06:39.565 --> 06:42.341
Oh, of course. What have you got, Murdoch?

06:42.402 --> 06:44.439
It appears our victim, Elvira Cummings,

06:44.470 --> 06:46.450
was poisoned while onstage

06:46.472 --> 06:49.078
but may not have been the target.

06:49.108 --> 06:50.246
A mistake?

06:50.276 --> 06:53.086
Miss Cummings replaced Madame
Hamilton during the performance,

06:53.112 --> 06:55.615
after the wine had been
poured into her glass.

06:55.648 --> 06:58.857
Madame Hamilton may have
been the intended victim.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.295
Who in their right mind

07:00.319 --> 07:02.356
would want to kill the
magnificent Hamilton?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.868
She's the finest soprano
in the world, Murdoch.

07:09.996 --> 07:12.772
You'll have to excuse me, Inspector.

07:12.799 --> 07:16.008
Elvira's death has been quite a shock.

07:16.035 --> 07:18.481
You knew Miss Cummings well, madam?

07:22.675 --> 07:26.179
She was my discovery, my protégé©.

07:26.212 --> 07:28.055
We did everything together.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.390
She could sing?

07:30.450 --> 07:32.396
I was grooming her, Inspector.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.558
No voice springs fully formed.

07:35.621 --> 07:38.397
She blossomed under my tutelage.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.699
What an opportunity for the young woman,

07:40.726 --> 07:43.002
learning at the hand of
a master like yourself.

07:43.029 --> 07:44.406
Yes.

07:44.464 --> 07:48.037
Though I admit I was
flattered by her devotion.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.377
She adopted my mannerisms,

07:50.403 --> 07:52.405
started wearing my perfume.

07:52.472 --> 07:56.147
Elvira liked to take souvenirs
from my dressing room-

07:56.175 --> 07:58.553
little things, small treats-

07:58.578 --> 08:01.320
thinking I didn't notice.

08:01.347 --> 08:04.260
She wanted so much to be me.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.493
Please, sit.

08:09.522 --> 08:12.230
Oh, thank you.

08:12.258 --> 08:13.669
Can you think of anyone

08:13.693 --> 08:15.502
who would want to harm
you, Madame Hamilton?

08:15.528 --> 08:17.007
No.

08:17.029 --> 08:19.100
I am the star of La Boheme.

08:19.165 --> 08:22.874
The rest of this provincial
cast would be nothing without me.

08:22.902 --> 08:24.040
Nothing.

08:24.070 --> 08:25.708
What about Signor Corsi?

08:25.738 --> 08:28.844
Carlo is... adequate.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.412
But it is my voice the
people flock to hear.

08:31.444 --> 08:32.889
Not his.

08:32.912 --> 08:34.186
Ask Arturo.

08:34.212 --> 08:36.419
He begged me to join the company.

08:36.448 --> 08:37.951
Rosa?

08:38.017 --> 08:40.964
She's the queen of my nightmares.

08:41.020 --> 08:45.093
She drives a man mad with
her demands and tantrums.

08:45.124 --> 08:47.570
I see, Signor Arturo.

08:47.593 --> 08:49.038
So you tolerate her.

08:49.061 --> 08:52.304
She is the goose that lays the golden egg.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.470
Hers is the voice that sells tickets

08:54.534 --> 08:57.413
at box offices all over the world.

08:57.436 --> 08:59.939
Has this company been together for long?

08:59.972 --> 09:02.543
I formed a travelling
company out of New York

09:02.575 --> 09:04.248
several years ago.

09:04.277 --> 09:07.622
Rosa doesn't like to
leave her home in Europe,

09:07.647 --> 09:11.424
but Corsi and I, we persuaded her.

09:11.450 --> 09:15.899
The North American audience
was crying out to hear her.

09:15.922 --> 09:17.458
And Miss Cummings?

09:17.490 --> 09:20.494
Oh, that Elvira should die like that,

09:20.560 --> 09:22.665
it's terrible.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.674
She was a sweet thing.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.973
Such a voice for one so young.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.073
And her body, bellissima.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.344
Signor Arturo, do you know of anyone

09:35.408 --> 09:37.445
who may want to kill Rosa?

09:37.476 --> 09:39.251
Talk to Carlo Corsi.

09:39.278 --> 09:40.416
Corsi?

09:40.446 --> 09:42.858
The tenor who plays... Rodolfo?

09:42.915 --> 09:45.953
He was smitten with Elvira, Detective.

09:45.985 --> 09:49.455
He might want his older lover, Rosa,

09:49.488 --> 09:51.661
to take, uh-how
do you say it-

09:51.691 --> 09:53.432
a rear seat.

09:53.459 --> 09:55.700
That is ridiculous.

09:55.761 --> 09:58.105
I had no feelings for Elvira.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.474
But you quarreled with
Rosa at the rehearsal.

10:00.499 --> 10:02.979
Of course. We're lovers.

10:03.002 --> 10:04.879
All lovers fight, Detective.

10:04.937 --> 10:09.283
Rosa is a very passionate
woman, both on and off the stage.

10:09.308 --> 10:11.345
So you admit to having differences.

10:11.377 --> 10:14.051
She is selfish and insufferable,

10:14.113 --> 10:16.059
but I wouldn't kill her.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.561
You police should be
talking to Miss Thiery.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.659
Anne Marie Thiery?

10:21.687 --> 10:23.064
Yes.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.193
Mimi is nothing.

10:25.224 --> 10:27.568
Musetta is the character with spirit.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.130
Musetta does have a fine solo in act two.

10:30.162 --> 10:31.971
To play Musetta requires skilled acting,

10:31.998 --> 10:34.808
not mooning about like
that lovesick waif Mimi.

10:34.834 --> 10:37.371
Mimi is the role that
opera audiences will love

10:37.403 --> 10:39.508
100 years from now, Miss Thiery.

10:39.538 --> 10:42.883
Every singer longs for
that kind of immortality.

10:42.908 --> 10:45.514
I am familiar with La Boheme, mademoiselle.

10:45.544 --> 10:47.922
It may be Puccini's newest work,

10:47.980 --> 10:50.017
but I wager it will be his most memorable.

10:50.049 --> 10:54.156
That may be, but it's not
me who wanted to play Mimi.

10:54.186 --> 10:55.824
Who did?

10:55.855 --> 10:57.596
The dead girl, Elvira,

10:57.657 --> 10:59.568
God rest her soul.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.162
She was the ambitious one.

11:01.193 --> 11:02.763
Elvira?

11:02.828 --> 11:04.603
She pretended to be innocent,

11:04.664 --> 11:07.611
but underneath the act, she was conniving.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.169
She bamboozled Madame Hamilton,

11:09.201 --> 11:10.680
though no one would dare to say it.

11:10.703 --> 11:12.080
What do you mean?

11:12.104 --> 11:15.415
Rosa wouldn't hear a word
uttered against Elvira.

11:15.441 --> 11:17.546
She thought the girl could do no wrong.

11:17.576 --> 11:19.715
Thank you, Miss Thiery.

11:19.745 --> 11:22.021
You've been most helpful.

11:22.048 --> 11:24.187
Who wanted to kill Rosa?

11:24.216 --> 11:26.253
We all did.

11:26.285 --> 11:28.128
I will remind you, sir,
that I'm a policeman.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.928
Your words could easily be misinterpreted.

11:29.955 --> 11:32.026
It's true. We all wanted her dead.

11:32.058 --> 11:35.267
But to kill such a young
beauty as Elvira by mistake,

11:35.294 --> 11:37.399
that is a tragedy.

11:37.430 --> 11:40.604
What else can you tell me, Mr. Domenicke?

11:40.633 --> 11:42.476
I was the one who heard her last word.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.139
- You did?
- Yes.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.911
It was "viola."

11:46.939 --> 11:49.442
Do you know what she meant?

11:49.475 --> 11:50.715
No.

11:57.483 --> 11:59.827
All the viola players are accounted for.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.092
In fact, sirs, none of
the orchestra members

12:02.121 --> 12:03.794
had an opportunity to slip poison

12:03.823 --> 12:05.234
into Miss Cummings' glass.

12:05.257 --> 12:07.237
At the time of the
murder, they were all in...

12:07.259 --> 12:08.670
the pit.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.469
An unfortunate term, in my opinion.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.169
Thank you, George.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.905
Miss Cummings' last word, viola,

12:14.934 --> 12:16.641
in Italian it means "violet."

12:16.669 --> 12:19.411
Could the victim be
referring to violet the color?

12:19.438 --> 12:20.849
Or violet the flower?

12:20.906 --> 12:22.227
There were violets on the bonnet

12:22.241 --> 12:23.618
the victim was holding when she died.

12:23.642 --> 12:26.248
Ah, yes, the bonnet.

12:26.278 --> 12:27.621
The bonnet has great significance

12:27.646 --> 12:29.023
in the plot of La Boheme.

12:29.081 --> 12:32.460
Rodolfo buys it for Mimi
as a token of his love.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.931
While the actors who play Rodolfo and Mimi,

12:34.954 --> 12:38.333
Rosa Hamilton and Carlo
Corsi, are lovers in real life.

12:38.357 --> 12:40.598
This acting company seems a dramatic lot.

12:40.626 --> 12:42.666
There is as much emotion
offstage as there is on it.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.641
They're actors, Crabtree,

12:44.663 --> 12:47.269
an occupation that requires
the employ of one's passions.

12:47.299 --> 12:48.860
They can't just bury the fury of emotion

12:48.868 --> 12:50.711
once the curtain falls.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.716
Apparently not.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.479
Judging by the interviews,

12:54.507 --> 12:57.283
all of our cast had motive
for killing Madame Hamilton,

12:57.309 --> 12:58.947
including the victim herself.

12:58.978 --> 13:01.015
Miss Cummings was ambitious.

13:01.046 --> 13:03.185
And possibly in some
love triangle with Corsi.

13:03.215 --> 13:04.216
Exactly.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.559
All the more reason why having
Madame Hamilton out of her way

13:06.619 --> 13:07.893
would be very convenient.

13:07.953 --> 13:10.160
Well, perhaps she
accidentally ingested poison

13:10.189 --> 13:12.635
that she had intended for Madame Hamilton.

13:19.031 --> 13:20.977
There was a strong smell of bitter almond

13:21.000 --> 13:22.741
when I cut open the victim's stomach,

13:22.802 --> 13:25.373
and her skin was pinker than normal,

13:25.404 --> 13:27.577
a sign of internal asphyxia.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.314
I believe the poison was potassium cyanide.

13:30.342 --> 13:32.583
- A quick-acting
substance. - Yes.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.921
She very likely was killed onstage

13:34.980 --> 13:37.517
by a fellow actor who slipped
the poison into the wine

13:37.550 --> 13:40.360
after it was poured into Rosa's glass.

13:40.386 --> 13:42.593
We've arrived at the same conclusion.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.225
Will you be conducting more tests?

13:44.256 --> 13:46.258
Yes, but it will take time.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.737
You will the first to know my results.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.934
Thank you, Doctor.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.907
Constable Crabtree has conducted a search

13:52.932 --> 13:55.435
for potassium cyanide at the theater.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.707
Nothing's materialized.

13:56.735 --> 13:58.214
Had to be one of the actors.

13:58.237 --> 14:00.114
They've been working in
close quarters for months.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.675
Who knows where all those
tensions and jealousies come in?

14:02.708 --> 14:04.029
There's also Signor Arturo, sir.

14:04.043 --> 14:05.545
- He was there.
- That's true.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.251
And then there's that props fellow.

14:07.279 --> 14:08.622
Mrs. Brackenreid.

14:08.681 --> 14:09.853
Hello, Detective Murdoch.

14:09.882 --> 14:11.623
Margaret. What are you doing here?

14:11.684 --> 14:12.685
I came by to tell you

14:12.718 --> 14:14.561
that I picked up the
tickets from the box office.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.430
There's quite a commotion at the theater.

14:16.455 --> 14:17.456
As there would be.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.469
Are you sure the performance
will still take place?

14:19.525 --> 14:22.301
Rosa Hamilton won't disappoint
her faithful followers.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.739
Thomas has talked about
nothing but Rosa Hamilton this

14:24.763 --> 14:26.606
and Rosa Hamilton that for weeks.

14:26.632 --> 14:28.805
Oh, it promises to be quite a performance.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.472
You must be very excited.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.981
Not really.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.448
I'd rather have a good
laugh at the music hall,

14:33.472 --> 14:35.952
but Thomas insisted I give it a try.

14:35.975 --> 14:38.717
It's a good excuse for
a new dress, as I see it.

14:38.744 --> 14:40.024
I'll see you at home, Margaret.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.047
Don't be too late.

14:42.081 --> 14:44.288
The missus doesn't share
my love for culture.

14:44.316 --> 14:46.592
I haven't told her the
whole thing's in Italian yet.

14:46.619 --> 14:47.927
But will she follow the story?

14:47.953 --> 14:49.398
It's not that hard.

14:49.421 --> 14:52.163
Rodolfo's jealousy almost
destroys his love for Mimi.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.727
Only when it's too late does
he tell her she's his true love.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.502
Then Mimi dies of consumption.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.564
That's it?

14:58.597 --> 15:00.099
It's not about the story, Murdoch.

15:00.132 --> 15:02.305
Opera's about the expression of emotion,

15:02.334 --> 15:05.508
pure emotion expressed
through virtuosic singing.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.279
I had no idea you had
an ear for opera, sir.

15:08.307 --> 15:09.786
Life holds greater riches

15:09.808 --> 15:11.446
than a job in the Toronto Constabulary.

15:11.477 --> 15:13.423
There's a lot you don't
know about me, Murdoch.

15:13.445 --> 15:14.583
- Clearly.
- Sirs.

15:14.613 --> 15:16.684
We've received a message
from Signor Arturo.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.117
You're needed at the theater immediately.

15:19.118 --> 15:21.257
Officers, there is no time to lose.

15:21.287 --> 15:24.427
We beautiful star, my diva...

15:24.456 --> 15:26.333
These arrived at the stage door.

15:26.358 --> 15:30.306
Violets. With this note.

15:30.329 --> 15:32.036
"Your life is mine."

15:40.839 --> 15:42.876
You've received other such notes?

15:42.942 --> 15:45.786
They started arriving
after we played Chicago.

15:45.811 --> 15:47.848
Why didn't you tell me?

15:47.880 --> 15:49.382
They were all silly nonsense.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.052
I simply ignored them.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.824
None of them threatened me.

15:53.852 --> 15:55.354
Do you have the other notes?

15:55.387 --> 15:57.230
Some of them.

16:00.192 --> 16:02.968
I thought of them as
charming billets-doux.

16:07.833 --> 16:10.040
I suppose I was wrong.

16:14.573 --> 16:16.849
Madame Hamilton, you must be ever vigilant

16:16.875 --> 16:18.912
until this killer is apprehended.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.184
I'll post a constable to watch-

16:20.212 --> 16:23.352
- A constable? I don't think so, Murdoch.

16:23.382 --> 16:26.226
May I offer my services
as your personal bodyguard?

16:26.251 --> 16:28.857
Why, Inspector,

16:28.887 --> 16:32.334
do your other duties allow
for such a commitment?

16:32.358 --> 16:33.359
Your safety

16:33.392 --> 16:36.339
is the Constabulary's paramount
concern, Madame Hamilton.

16:36.362 --> 16:39.775
Then I accept your generous offer.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.506
Perhaps you could escort me to my hotel?

16:42.534 --> 16:44.411
Absolutely.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.285
Thank you, everyone. Move aside.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.415
Clear a path. Madam, this way.

16:54.446 --> 16:55.618
Thank you. Thank you.

17:03.422 --> 17:06.266
Madame Hamilton, will you
still be performing tomorrow?

17:06.290 --> 17:08.031
Of course.

17:09.094 --> 17:10.300
Thank you.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.443
That's enough. Thank you.

17:11.463 --> 17:13.409
Thank you, everyone.

17:13.432 --> 17:14.705
There you go, madam.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.983
Do you face crowds like this in every city?

17:26.045 --> 17:27.752
Of course.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.282
Must be overwhelming for you.

17:29.314 --> 17:31.419
Overwhelming?

17:31.450 --> 17:33.327
Their applause sustains me.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.455
But to mobbed like that...

17:34.486 --> 17:37.729
A star needs an adoring audience.

17:37.756 --> 17:39.676
Do the other actors
receive the same attention?

17:39.725 --> 17:42.638
A few tittering young ladies
sometimes wait at the door

17:42.661 --> 17:44.607
for a glimpse of Carlo.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.906
How well do you know Signor Corsi?

17:46.932 --> 17:48.275
Carlo and I have been lovers

17:48.300 --> 17:50.906
since we sang together
in Milan ten years ago.

17:50.936 --> 17:51.937
Why?

17:51.970 --> 17:54.849
Well, there are rumors
about him and Miss Cummings.

17:54.907 --> 17:58.081
Carlo has a wandering eye.
It's part of his charm.

17:58.110 --> 18:01.421
And Elvira had a flirtatious nature.

18:01.447 --> 18:02.983
A folly of the girl's youth.

18:03.015 --> 18:04.824
So there was something between them?

18:04.850 --> 18:07.330
Of course not.

18:07.352 --> 18:10.765
Elvira was like a younger sister to me.

18:10.789 --> 18:14.703
I admire the way you handled that crowd.

18:14.760 --> 18:18.139
A woman would feel safe around you, Thomas.

18:18.163 --> 18:20.439
Can I call you Thomas?

18:20.466 --> 18:21.672
Of course.

18:28.307 --> 18:30.184
Anything, sir?

18:30.209 --> 18:32.951
Have a look at this, George.

18:32.978 --> 18:35.185
Tidy writing. Good spelling.

18:35.214 --> 18:37.990
The work of an educated
person, I would say.

18:38.016 --> 18:39.495
Oh.

18:39.518 --> 18:40.861
Is that an ink stain, sir?

18:40.886 --> 18:41.887
I don't think so, George.

18:41.954 --> 18:45.231
It's darker than the writing.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.236
When I add water to it...

18:49.995 --> 18:51.633
it doesn't run.

18:51.663 --> 18:54.303
It's some sort of permanent dye.

18:54.333 --> 18:55.710
Indigo, perhaps.

18:55.734 --> 18:57.805
And how does that help us, sir?

18:57.836 --> 19:00.874
I have no idea. How did you fare?

19:00.906 --> 19:02.044
Well, the flowers were ordered

19:02.074 --> 19:03.849
from a florist on Queen
Street two days ago.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.482
The method of payment
was cash in an envelope

19:06.512 --> 19:09.083
pushed under the door.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.185
Another in a series of mysteries.

19:11.216 --> 19:13.355
Quite so, sir, including
the victim herself.

19:13.385 --> 19:14.523
How do you mean?

19:14.553 --> 19:16.590
Well, I tried to contact
Miss Cummings' relatives

19:16.655 --> 19:18.931
to inform them of her untimely passing.

19:18.991 --> 19:23.667
The address she gave in
Chicago doesn't exist.

19:23.695 --> 19:25.504
That's strange.

19:25.531 --> 19:28.102
Perhaps Signor Arturo
can help you with that.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.204
Hmm, perhaps.

19:38.510 --> 19:42.390
Elvira joined the company
in Chicago as Rosa's dresser

19:42.414 --> 19:44.052
six months ago.

19:44.082 --> 19:46.426
But apart from the
address I have given you,

19:46.451 --> 19:48.761
I know little of the girl's background.

19:48.787 --> 19:51.063
Madame Hamilton must have
taken quite a shine to the girl.

19:51.089 --> 19:52.090
Mm-hmm.

19:52.124 --> 19:53.728
Yeah.

19:53.759 --> 19:58.401
Rosa took Elvira under her
wing from the first instant.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.307
She loved the girl's voice

20:00.365 --> 20:03.437
and insisted I hire her as a chorus member.

20:03.468 --> 20:05.573
And then also, she was an
understudy for the company?

20:05.604 --> 20:07.413
Only for Rosa,

20:07.439 --> 20:09.146
though she was hardly needed.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.984
Rosa would never miss a performance.

20:12.044 --> 20:15.821
On her deathbed, that
woman would still sing.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.417
A true artist.

20:17.449 --> 20:19.258
Elvira must have had a good voice, then.

20:19.284 --> 20:20.285
Mm-hmm.

20:20.319 --> 20:23.562
Rosa was teaching her to
develop her vocal control.

20:23.589 --> 20:27.127
Oh, she had the voice;
There is no question.

20:27.159 --> 20:31.904
If she had only lived,
the poor little songbird.

20:31.930 --> 20:34.570
Ah, in the column.

20:34.600 --> 20:38.013
Now, if you will excuse me, Constable,

20:38.070 --> 20:40.175
I have a civic reception to prepare for.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.651
Yes, of course, thank you, Signor Arturo.

20:51.183 --> 20:52.628
I believe that Miss Cummings

20:52.651 --> 20:55.530
inveigled her way into
Rosa Hamilton's life.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.032
As I understand it, sir,

20:57.089 --> 20:58.762
an intimate relationship can often form

20:58.790 --> 21:01.168
between an artist and her dresser,

21:01.193 --> 21:04.606
wherein the dresser can
become a trusted confidant.

21:04.630 --> 21:06.337
George, what are you trying to tell me?

21:06.365 --> 21:08.311
Well, sir, look at the
contents of the letters.

21:08.333 --> 21:09.505
"I will care for you."

21:09.534 --> 21:10.945
"I will protect you."

21:10.969 --> 21:12.346
Letters that began to arrive

21:12.371 --> 21:14.044
after the company performed in Chicago,

21:14.106 --> 21:15.517
after Elvira joined.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.110
So it's your belief that Miss Cummings

21:17.142 --> 21:18.849
was writing the letters to Madame Hamilton.

21:18.877 --> 21:19.855
Yes, sir.

21:19.878 --> 21:22.119
And she could have been the one
to send the bouquet of violets.

21:22.147 --> 21:24.627
They were ordered before she died.

21:24.650 --> 21:28.359
But why would Miss Cummings
want to kill her mentor, hmm?

21:28.387 --> 21:30.025
To take her place, sir.

21:30.055 --> 21:31.728
Except she accidentally drank the poison

21:31.790 --> 21:33.565
that she intended for Rosa.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.070
Is that plausible?

21:35.127 --> 21:37.073
Well, sir, there were six actors

21:37.129 --> 21:39.302
gathered around a couple
of small cafe tables,

21:39.331 --> 21:42.642
upon which are six
identical glasses of wine.

21:42.668 --> 21:44.739
Now, it's quite conceivable
that Miss Cummings,

21:44.803 --> 21:46.077
now in the role of Mimi,

21:46.138 --> 21:48.641
now standing where Mimi would have,

21:48.674 --> 21:50.881
erroneously drank from the diva's glass.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.185
That's an interesting theory, George.

21:55.213 --> 21:56.248
Thank you, sir.

22:02.888 --> 22:05.232
You've played that
- that singing

22:05.257 --> 22:06.600
at least five times now, Thomas.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.433
I am tiring of it.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.494
How can one tire

22:09.528 --> 22:11.530
of such a passionate
expression of love, Margaret?

22:11.563 --> 22:13.201
Perhaps one is more attuned

22:13.231 --> 22:15.336
to a certain shrillness in her voice.

22:18.904 --> 22:20.679
I'll get it.

22:24.576 --> 22:26.021
Thank you.

22:31.450 --> 22:33.726
They're for you, Thomas.

22:33.752 --> 22:34.753
For me?

22:34.786 --> 22:38.233
"To Thomas, with gratitude. Rosa."

22:38.256 --> 22:41.203
- Margaret.
- She would send a man flowers.

22:41.226 --> 22:44.139
She is a lady of rare breeding.

22:44.196 --> 22:47.302
And now... I must get a move on.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.606
Mmm.

22:48.633 --> 22:52.308
I'm picking up Madame Hamilton
at the Queen's Hotel at 6:00.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.248
Au revoir, ma cherie.

23:06.151 --> 23:08.131
Puccini's Bohemian cafe

23:08.153 --> 23:10.429
is a very different setting for an opera,

23:10.455 --> 23:14.335
but what finer place for
our reception this evening?

23:14.393 --> 23:17.397
I may admire your
detecting skills, Murdoch,

23:17.429 --> 23:19.170
but your sense of style-

23:19.231 --> 23:22.075
a little underdressed for
cocktails, don't you think?

23:23.769 --> 23:26.807
Yes, I sang with Enrico Caruso.

23:26.838 --> 23:30.308
Oh, he loves his little practical jokes.

23:30.342 --> 23:33.687
In Paris, in the midst
of Che Gelida Manina...

23:33.745 --> 23:36.123
The famous aria, "Your
tiny hand is frozen."

23:36.148 --> 23:40.654
He presses into my hand a hot sausage.

23:42.020 --> 23:44.296
Oh, the little devil.

23:44.322 --> 23:47.360
He knew Puccini was in the audience.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.104
Mr. Peters.

23:51.129 --> 23:53.871
Do you recall where
Miss Cummings was seated

23:53.932 --> 23:55.639
when she picked up the glass?

23:55.667 --> 23:57.476
Oh, Mimi picks up the glass.

23:57.502 --> 23:59.812
Oh, no, no, no, Detective.
That's quite wrong.

23:59.838 --> 24:02.546
In the scene, Rodolfo picks up two glasses

24:02.607 --> 24:05.053
and hands one of them to Mimi.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.384
Ah, I see.

24:06.445 --> 24:09.153
Rodolfo, played by Signor Corsi, yes?

24:09.181 --> 24:10.387
Yes.

24:13.718 --> 24:14.822
She's a wonderful singer.

24:14.853 --> 24:16.355
She's in it. So good.

24:16.388 --> 24:19.164
I don't believe we've met, Detective.

24:19.191 --> 24:20.864
I'm Mademoiselle Thiery.

24:20.892 --> 24:23.668
Ah, yes, of course. You
play the part of Musetta.

24:23.695 --> 24:24.969
You must be an opera lover.

24:26.231 --> 24:28.643
I confess to being somewhat of a neophyte.

24:28.667 --> 24:32.046
However, the performance
promises to be very exciting.

24:32.070 --> 24:34.414
If Rosa survives the night.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.975
You have reason to believe that she won't,

24:36.007 --> 24:37.486
Mademoiselle Thiery?

24:37.509 --> 24:38.681
Well, there is a murderer among us,

24:38.710 --> 24:40.053
is there not, Detective?

24:40.078 --> 24:43.321
Why else would you be here?

24:43.348 --> 24:45.726
I am quite nervous.

24:45.750 --> 24:49.027
Madam, I won't take my eyes off you.

24:49.054 --> 24:51.364
Would you be a dear
and refill my champagne?

24:51.389 --> 24:53.266
- Of course.
- Thank you.

24:56.361 --> 24:58.432
Rosa Hamilton is getting old.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.204
Be careful what you say, Domenicke.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.178
It's true. Everyone knows it.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.407
It's time for a younger woman to take over.

25:04.436 --> 25:05.540
Hmm. And you are suggesting...

25:05.570 --> 25:08.779
Anne Marie has the voice.
You've said so many times.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.547
What am I to say to Rosa?

25:10.575 --> 25:12.851
That may not be a problem for much longer.

25:12.878 --> 25:15.449
Ah, be careful, my young friend.

25:15.514 --> 25:20.190
Your love for Anne Marie
will get you into trouble.

25:20.218 --> 25:23.199
There you are, Thomas.
Is that my champagne?

25:23.221 --> 25:24.928
- Yes.
- Thank you.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.064
Madam!

25:31.563 --> 25:32.940
Oh, my dear!

25:35.267 --> 25:38.146
Is everyone all right?

25:39.638 --> 25:42.881
I believe you've just saved my life.

25:46.578 --> 25:48.489
This was no accident, sir.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.220
Bloody hell.

25:50.248 --> 25:52.751
Another attempt on Madame Hamilton's life.

25:52.784 --> 25:55.390
Let's get out of here, Murdoch.

26:03.161 --> 26:05.505
Oh, there you are, Thomas.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.840
Uh, the boys are in bed,
but I waited dinner for you.

26:07.899 --> 26:10.072
Tripe and onions.

26:10.101 --> 26:12.513
I'm sorry, Margaret, but
dinner will have to keep.

26:12.571 --> 26:13.743
I've just received a message.

26:13.772 --> 26:15.615
I have to go back to the theater.

26:15.640 --> 26:17.347
Madame Hamilton needs me right away.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.685
Couldn't you send Constable Crabtree?

26:19.744 --> 26:23.282
La diva sent for me for a reason, Margaret.

26:23.315 --> 26:26.694
Must be a matter of great urgency.

26:26.751 --> 26:28.788
La diva?

26:37.696 --> 26:39.141
Hello?

26:41.833 --> 26:45.007
Hello? Madame Hamilton?

26:49.841 --> 26:51.047
Hello?

26:52.677 --> 26:55.021
There you are, Thomas.

26:55.046 --> 26:58.027
Madame Hamilton.

26:58.049 --> 27:00.188
Are you all right? What's this all about?

27:00.218 --> 27:02.789
Please, call me Rosa.

27:02.821 --> 27:07.236
This is my humble attempt to
thank you for saving my life.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.067
I hope you like pheasant.

27:09.127 --> 27:12.074
Well, certainly beats tripe and onions.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.804
Please, sit down, Thomas.

27:16.501 --> 27:18.481
So tell me about Carlo, Rosa.

27:18.503 --> 27:20.380
Is he good to you?

27:20.405 --> 27:22.749
He's a man of many passions,

27:22.807 --> 27:25.185
but he's fickle with his attentions.

27:25.210 --> 27:28.350
He's like a bumblebee who
must stop at every flower.

27:28.380 --> 27:31.054
Flowers like Elvira Cummings?

27:31.082 --> 27:33.585
He's not like you, Thomas.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.861
You're a dependable man
who protects his woman.

27:40.525 --> 27:42.095
But when you sing together...

27:42.160 --> 27:44.197
When we sing,

27:44.229 --> 27:48.575
we are not Carlo and
Rosa but Rodolfo and Mimi.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.045
Ah, Mimi.

27:50.068 --> 27:52.674
The tragic role that every
soprano longs to sing-

27:52.704 --> 27:55.241
including, I presume,
Miss Anne Marie Thiery.

27:55.273 --> 27:56.411
Of course.

27:56.441 --> 27:58.785
And she would do anything to get the part,

27:58.843 --> 28:03.223
even allow herself to be
seduced by that old goat Arturo.

28:03.248 --> 28:05.125
Arturo? Really?

28:05.183 --> 28:07.789
We've all allowed Arturo some...

28:07.852 --> 28:09.763
liberties.

28:09.788 --> 28:13.702
I was younger then. It seemed a trifle.

28:14.926 --> 28:16.599
And what does Domenicke think

28:16.628 --> 28:19.472
about his true love, Anne
Marie, trifling with Arturo?

28:19.531 --> 28:23.638
Domenicke would do anything
to get Anne Marie the part.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.272
Even murder?

28:25.303 --> 28:28.773
He would do anything to
help that fraud he loves.

28:31.242 --> 28:33.415
Are you all right?

28:33.445 --> 28:36.722
This is a terrible business.

28:36.748 --> 28:40.628
Behind the scenes, it
is a battle every day.

28:40.652 --> 28:44.099
Sometimes I think they would
all be happy if I were dead.

28:44.122 --> 28:45.567
Oh, that's not true.

28:45.590 --> 28:48.799
They'd miss their pay
packet, but that's all.

28:48.827 --> 28:50.568
Even Arturo.

28:50.595 --> 28:54.008
And it's only a matter of time
before Carlo will leave me.

28:54.065 --> 28:56.011
You're wrong.

28:56.067 --> 28:58.513
No one holds a candle to you.

28:58.570 --> 29:02.279
There will only ever be one Rosa Hamilton.

29:11.916 --> 29:14.863
What did you mean, Anne Marie is a fraud?

29:14.919 --> 29:18.526
Anne Marie isn't even her real name.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.764
It's Viola Evans.

29:24.662 --> 29:28.804
I use a stage name. That's hardly a crime.

29:28.833 --> 29:32.474
Who in the company knew your real name?

29:32.504 --> 29:34.108
Elvira found out.

29:34.139 --> 29:36.483
She made it her business
to know people's secrets.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.613
Mm.

29:38.643 --> 29:41.283
You would like Madame Hamilton's
position in the company,

29:41.312 --> 29:43.019
wouldn't you?

29:43.047 --> 29:46.358
Become prima donna? Of course.

29:46.384 --> 29:47.988
The adoring fans would be waiting

29:48.019 --> 29:51.330
at the stage door for you and not her.

29:51.356 --> 29:53.393
Rosa gets far too much attention.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.734
Mm. That must be infuriating.

29:55.794 --> 29:59.003
After all, you work as hard
and sing as well as she does.

29:59.030 --> 30:00.907
It's completely unfair.

30:00.965 --> 30:03.969
Unfair enough to kill her, Miss Evans?

30:04.002 --> 30:04.980
What do you mean?

30:05.003 --> 30:06.744
Your name, Viola,

30:06.805 --> 30:09.411
was the last word uttered
by Elvira Cummings.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.715
Did you intend to kill Madame Hamilton?

30:11.743 --> 30:13.984
I did not.

30:14.012 --> 30:15.355
And even if I did poison her,

30:15.380 --> 30:18.259
Arturo would never let me play Mimi.

30:18.316 --> 30:19.989
What do you mean?

30:20.018 --> 30:22.498
He would have given the
role to Elvira Cummings.

30:22.520 --> 30:25.729
She had him wrapped
around her little finger.

30:38.736 --> 30:40.545
There's Corsi, Rosa, and Elvira,

30:40.572 --> 30:43.052
and then there's Corsi, Rosa, and Arturo.

30:43.074 --> 30:44.451
The love affairs within the company

30:44.509 --> 30:45.920
are many, many faceted, Crabtree.

30:45.944 --> 30:47.753
You mean Elvira and Arturo?

30:47.779 --> 30:49.850
Yes, and Rosa. Rosa and Arturo?

30:49.881 --> 30:51.361
Back when she was young and foolish.

30:51.382 --> 30:54.591
Oh, then there's Domenicke,
Anne Marie, and Arturo.

30:54.619 --> 30:56.121
Arturo again?

30:56.187 --> 30:58.133
Yes, Crabtree. He's a bit of a lad.

30:58.189 --> 30:59.964
Detective.

31:00.024 --> 31:02.527
Another letter has arrived.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.801
Now he asks Rosa to meet him.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.036
- When?
- One hour from now.

31:07.065 --> 31:08.601
In the park near the theater.

31:08.633 --> 31:11.409
Sir, the handwriting,
it's not quite the same.

31:11.436 --> 31:12.881
There's no time for that, Murdoch.

31:12.904 --> 31:14.144
Let's get a move on.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.456
Carlo?

31:29.487 --> 31:31.660
Well, I wasn't expecting him.

31:31.723 --> 31:34.602
Uh, sir, let us wait.

31:34.626 --> 31:37.436
You? You wrote the letters?

31:37.462 --> 31:38.941
What letters?

31:38.963 --> 31:41.466
Then what are you doing here?

31:41.499 --> 31:43.809
I followed you.

31:43.835 --> 31:46.338
I need to talk to you.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.247
Why are you doing this to me?

31:48.273 --> 31:50.947
You are breaking me in two, Rosa.

31:50.975 --> 31:51.976
What do you mean?

31:52.010 --> 31:53.512
Why do you shower your affections

31:53.578 --> 31:55.854
on that oaf of a policeman?

31:55.914 --> 31:57.757
He's actually quite charming.

31:57.782 --> 32:00.285
Why do you torture me this way?

32:00.318 --> 32:01.820
What is the difficulty?

32:01.853 --> 32:04.299
I can be with whatever man I want.

32:04.322 --> 32:07.269
- You can't.
- And why not?

32:07.292 --> 32:09.772
You have every young woman you fancy.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.806
Even my Elvira.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.872
She tempted me,

32:17.936 --> 32:21.782
and I am a weak, weak man.

32:21.806 --> 32:23.479
She meant nothing to me.

32:23.508 --> 32:26.489
What? Why didn't you tell me?

32:26.511 --> 32:30.960
I knew it would break your heart.

32:30.982 --> 32:32.689
Excuse me.

32:32.717 --> 32:34.321
And who are you?

32:34.352 --> 32:37.231
I cannot compete with a
world famous opera star,

32:37.288 --> 32:38.232
but I am...

32:38.289 --> 32:39.893
Bloody hell.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.461
That appears to be your wife, sir.

32:42.493 --> 32:44.996
I know that's my bloody wife, Murdoch.

32:45.029 --> 32:48.909
And I've come here to ask
you to leave him alone.

32:48.967 --> 32:52.972
Yes, Rosa, leave the policeman
to his wife like she asks.

32:53.004 --> 32:56.645
Come back to me, Carlo, your true love.

32:56.674 --> 32:58.551
Thomas?

32:58.576 --> 32:59.919
What's going on, Margaret?

32:59.978 --> 33:01.423
I should ask you the same question.

33:01.479 --> 33:03.049
What do you see in her, Thomas?

33:03.081 --> 33:05.083
Oh, for God's sakes,
don't be so ridiculous.

33:05.149 --> 33:07.060
I'm in the middle of important police work.

33:07.085 --> 33:08.928
Is that what you call it?

33:08.987 --> 33:10.728
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

33:10.755 --> 33:13.759
Now go on home. I'll be along shortly.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.328
And who says the door will be open?

33:17.929 --> 33:19.602
Your wife has spirit.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.769
So she does.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.609
It must be nice to have
someone who treasures you.

33:27.939 --> 33:29.714
But, Rosa, I treasure you.

33:29.741 --> 33:30.742
Do you?

33:30.775 --> 33:32.015
The man with red hair cannot...

33:32.043 --> 33:34.785
Not quite what we were expecting, sir.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.257
God help me, Murdoch.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.590
I'm in the middle of a bloody opera plot.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.521
And even after all this time,

33:43.554 --> 33:44.931
I still don't know what the woman wants.

33:44.956 --> 33:46.264
I do what I can, Murdoch.

33:46.290 --> 33:48.065
God only knows I try.

33:48.092 --> 33:51.301
But perhaps I have been
neglecting the old girl lately.

33:51.362 --> 33:53.273
A situation you could remedy, sir.

33:53.297 --> 33:55.106
Take her to the music hall?

33:55.133 --> 33:56.441
That's an excellent idea.

33:56.467 --> 33:57.468
Oh...

33:57.535 --> 33:59.572
Gentlemen?

33:59.604 --> 34:01.277
I have results for you.

34:01.305 --> 34:02.648
Oh, thank goodness, Doctor.

34:02.707 --> 34:03.651
What have you?

34:03.708 --> 34:04.789
I ascertain Miss Cummings

34:04.809 --> 34:06.914
had a high sugar content
in her bloodstream,

34:06.944 --> 34:10.221
so I ran a series of tests and
made an interesting discovery.

34:10.248 --> 34:13.661
Sugar interacts with potassium
cyanide, slowing it down.

34:13.717 --> 34:15.061
Delaying the toxin's effects.

34:15.085 --> 34:16.429
Correct, Detective.

34:16.454 --> 34:17.989
Given Miss Cummings' body weight,

34:18.056 --> 34:19.558
it is likely she ingested the poison

34:19.590 --> 34:21.831
at least an hour before she reacted.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.270
- That much earlier?
- Yes.

34:23.293 --> 34:24.773
It is also quite possible

34:24.795 --> 34:28.141
that the killer disguised the
poison in something sugary.

34:28.166 --> 34:29.940
Are you quite sure?

34:29.967 --> 34:31.344
I completed the test three times.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.745
It's correct.

34:32.770 --> 34:35.808
She ingested the poison at
least an hour before she died.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.821
Sir, the cafe scene is in the second act.

34:38.842 --> 34:40.618
How long is the first act?

34:40.645 --> 34:42.920
Half an hour, I would say.

34:42.947 --> 34:44.688
Then Elvira Cummings ingested the poison

34:44.748 --> 34:46.922
before the dress rehearsal began.

34:46.951 --> 34:48.429
So she didn't die accidentally

34:48.453 --> 34:50.330
by taking a drink from Rosa's glass.

34:50.353 --> 34:53.027
No, sir. Thank you, Doctor.

34:55.126 --> 34:58.767
We now know that Elvira
Cummings was the intended target,

34:58.796 --> 35:00.798
not Rosa Hamilton.

35:21.819 --> 35:24.561
One of them poisoned
Elvira Cummings, Murdoch.

35:24.622 --> 35:27.398
They certainly all have motives, sir.

35:27.458 --> 35:29.460
Elvira Cummings was
threatening to tell Rosa

35:29.494 --> 35:31.997
about Corsi's indiscretions.

35:32.029 --> 35:36.239
Miss Cummings was in the way
of Anne Marie Thiery's ambition.

35:36.300 --> 35:39.372
Rizzini had every opportunity.

35:39.403 --> 35:41.178
Signor Arturo would
have been very displeased

35:41.205 --> 35:45.244
if his latest conquest was
also involved with Corsi.

35:45.309 --> 35:48.085
And our elusive letter
writer may have killed Elvira

35:48.146 --> 35:52.185
in a misguided attempt to protect Rosa.

35:52.216 --> 35:55.993
But how did any of them find
a way of poisoning the girl?

36:49.774 --> 36:51.276
What are you doing?

36:57.148 --> 36:58.991
Mr. Peters,

36:59.050 --> 37:00.154
you're the author of the letters.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.755
Madame Hamilton's been
receiving, aren't you?

37:02.787 --> 37:03.788
What letters?

37:03.821 --> 37:04.993
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.127
Perhaps we should have this
discussion at the station house.

37:07.158 --> 37:08.569
No.

37:08.593 --> 37:10.573
I can't leave the performance.

37:10.595 --> 37:12.302
The diva is relying on me.

37:14.298 --> 37:17.336
You take very special care
of Madame Hamilton, don't you?

37:17.401 --> 37:20.405
I do.

37:20.438 --> 37:24.079
I made Mimi's bonnet especially for her.

37:24.108 --> 37:27.089
With violets, her favorite flowers.

37:27.111 --> 37:30.092
She must appreciate all of
your thoughtful gestures.

37:30.114 --> 37:32.924
Oh, she...

37:32.950 --> 37:35.590
She doesn't notice me.

37:35.620 --> 37:39.534
So you got her attention
by writing the letters.

37:39.590 --> 37:40.830
Letters?

37:40.858 --> 37:43.361
The letters, Mr. Peters,
you wrote on this paper

37:43.427 --> 37:44.701
at this very desk.

37:44.762 --> 37:47.038
Mr. Peters, if you keep this
up, I will have no choice

37:47.098 --> 37:49.476
but to take you to the station
and charge you with murder.

37:49.500 --> 37:52.845
Now, did you write the letters or not?

37:52.870 --> 37:54.008
Yes.

37:54.038 --> 37:55.949
And you sent the bouquet?

37:55.973 --> 37:58.146
Yes.

37:58.175 --> 38:00.348
I wanted her to know I was here.

38:00.378 --> 38:04.155
I wanted her to see how much I admired her,

38:04.181 --> 38:06.024
but I would never harm her.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.666
You're responsible for
the lanterns as well.

38:12.690 --> 38:14.067
Yes, why?

38:14.125 --> 38:16.469
The scenery that fell and
almost killed Rosa Hamilton,

38:16.494 --> 38:19.236
the rope that secured it was
burnt through by a lantern.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.537
That had nothing to do with me.

38:20.564 --> 38:23.010
You were angry that Rosa
ignored your affections,

38:23.034 --> 38:25.412
so you waited for an opportunity
to exact your revenge.

38:25.469 --> 38:26.539
You set the lantern.

38:26.570 --> 38:28.243
No, I didn't.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.377
I have no idea how the lantern got there.

38:30.408 --> 38:33.048
You have to believe me.

38:33.077 --> 38:37.219
I'd checked the oil in the
wicks just the night before.

38:37.248 --> 38:39.660
You examined the lanterns the night before?

38:39.684 --> 38:40.685
Why?

38:40.718 --> 38:42.823
Madame Hamilton asked me to.

38:42.853 --> 38:45.026
She watched me as I
made sure they were full.

38:47.591 --> 38:49.366
I reassured her they'd be working perfectly

38:49.393 --> 38:51.999
for the third act at the Paris gates.

39:00.905 --> 39:03.943
Intermission.

39:04.008 --> 39:06.045
Excuse me, Detective.

39:06.077 --> 39:08.353
I must reset the stage for the next act.

39:10.281 --> 39:11.919
Thank you, Mr. Peters.

39:15.252 --> 39:17.026
Gifts from your many admirers, Rosa.

39:17.054 --> 39:19.056
And if I may say, richly deserved.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.433
Thank you, Thomas.

39:20.458 --> 39:22.460
Now, let me prepare myself.

39:22.526 --> 39:24.870
The final act is very demanding.

39:24.895 --> 39:25.873
Of course.

39:25.896 --> 39:28.433
Oh...

39:28.466 --> 39:31.811
This one's come a long
way. All the way from Italy.

39:31.869 --> 39:33.439
Oh, how wonderful.

39:33.471 --> 39:36.315
I was hoping it would
arrive before opening night.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.115
My favorite sweets.

39:38.142 --> 39:41.089
They're handmade in Milano
by the Renaldo brothers,

39:41.112 --> 39:42.648
my favorite Confectioners.

39:44.882 --> 39:47.328
And all for me.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.591
Well...

39:48.619 --> 39:50.098
Perhaps one for you.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.632
Do you like it?

40:00.064 --> 40:01.600
Viola.

40:01.632 --> 40:03.305
Thomas, what's wrong?

40:03.334 --> 40:06.577
Elvira liked to take souvenirs
from my dressing room,

40:06.604 --> 40:09.448
small things, thinking I didn't notice.

40:09.473 --> 40:10.747
Vi...

40:10.775 --> 40:12.277
ola.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.916
Inspector...

40:19.283 --> 40:21.923
I have to search your
dressing room, Madame Hamilton.

40:21.952 --> 40:23.260
For'?

40:23.287 --> 40:25.358
For cyanide.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.424
You poisoned the sweets,

40:26.457 --> 40:29.165
knowing that Elvira would eat them.

40:29.193 --> 40:30.934
Please, don't deny it.

40:38.702 --> 40:42.275
She was taking everything from me.

40:42.306 --> 40:45.651
It started with little
things, like the sweets.

40:45.676 --> 40:50.284
Even as I encouraged
her, she kept on taking.

40:50.314 --> 40:51.850
I didn't know how to stop her.

40:51.882 --> 40:54.055
She was just a slip of a
young girl compared to you.

40:54.118 --> 40:56.496
I'm no fool, Thomas.

40:56.520 --> 40:59.330
I can't sing forever.

40:59.356 --> 41:03.202
In a few years, she would
have been the next diva.

41:03.227 --> 41:05.571
That I could accept.

41:05.629 --> 41:08.633
But Carlo...

41:08.666 --> 41:10.236
when she took Carlo...

41:10.301 --> 41:13.180
But in the park, Carlo said he loved you.

41:13.204 --> 41:15.206
By then, it was too late.

41:17.508 --> 41:19.886
You have to come with me, madam.

41:21.345 --> 41:23.916
Five minutes to curtain, madam.

41:25.749 --> 41:28.559
Inspector...

41:28.586 --> 41:30.657
I beg you,

41:30.688 --> 41:32.827
let me finish my final performance.

41:32.857 --> 41:36.669
Then do with me what you wish.

41:36.694 --> 41:39.004
- Madam...
- Please.

41:39.029 --> 41:40.736
One last time.

41:43.033 --> 41:44.341
I'll be in the wings.

41:44.368 --> 41:46.075
Thank you.

41:47.071 --> 41:49.176
You're a man of honor.

42:06.423 --> 42:08.130
Ah, Inspector...

42:08.192 --> 42:10.570
I know, Murdoch.

42:10.594 --> 42:12.801
We'll arrest her at the
end of the performance.

42:58.108 --> 43:01.954
She's truly magnificent.

43:01.979 --> 43:05.449
We'll not hear anything
like her for a long time.

43:52.630 --> 43:55.338
IE1'.

44:22.559 --> 44:26.029
I' Mimi I'

44:43.113 --> 44:45.423
Rosa.

44:45.449 --> 44:47.224
Rosa?

44:47.251 --> 44:48.628
No!

44:48.686 --> 44:51.360
No, Rosa! Mi cara bella!

44:51.388 --> 44:52.696
Sir, something's wrong.

44:52.723 --> 44:53.929
Yes, Murdoch.

44:53.957 --> 44:56.130
Madame Hamilton is dead.

44:57.961 --> 44:59.872
Rosa!

45:07.304 --> 45:10.581
It's all my fault.

45:10.607 --> 45:12.484
My poor darling.

45:12.543 --> 45:14.921
This was in Madame
Hamilton's dressing room.

45:14.945 --> 45:16.424
Cyanide, sir.

45:16.447 --> 45:19.053
An operatic ending
worthy of Puccini himself.

45:24.221 --> 45:26.428
Uh, sir.

45:28.459 --> 45:31.463
I can take care of things here.

45:31.495 --> 45:33.338
Thank you, Murdoch.

45:42.673 --> 45:43.674
Margaret.

45:43.741 --> 45:45.743
I saw you kiss her, Thomas,
right here in this very theater.

45:45.776 --> 45:47.119
What?

45:47.144 --> 45:50.182
Rosa, Madame Hamilton was
trying to make Corsi jealous.

45:50.247 --> 45:52.693
Corsi? That good-looking singer, Corsi?

45:52.750 --> 45:54.855
Yes, he was her lover.

45:54.918 --> 45:58.024
And she thought that kissing
you would make him jealous?

45:58.088 --> 45:59.533
I'm sorry, Margaret.

45:59.590 --> 46:01.331
I got carried away.

46:06.663 --> 46:07.869
Why, Thomas...

46:07.931 --> 46:09.706
You look lovely.

46:09.767 --> 46:11.212
That new dress becomes you.

46:11.268 --> 46:12.941
Does it, now?

46:12.970 --> 46:14.506
It's a beautiful night.

46:14.538 --> 46:15.949
It is that.

46:15.973 --> 46:18.044
Do you fancy strolling home,

46:18.108 --> 46:20.054
just me and my best girl?

46:25.015 --> 46:28.053
So when did you become
the romantic, Thomas?

46:28.118 --> 46:29.995
I'm a man of many surprises, Margaret.

46:32.623 --> 46:33.567
Pub's open.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.002
Surprise, surprise.

46:36.026 --> 46:37.198
It was just...

46:37.227 --> 46:38.729
I could bloody well use a drink.

46:38.796 --> 46:40.207
We're strolling home, Thomas.

46:40.230 --> 46:41.504
Had you forgotten already?

46:41.532 --> 46:43.136
Of course I haven't, woman. I was just-

46:43.167 --> 46:44.510
Thomas.
