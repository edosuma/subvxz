that I must employ
drastic measures

16:38.250 --> 16:40.450
to fend for
my very peace of mind,

16:40.483 --> 16:46.016
and so I have constructed
the dream machine...

16:46.050 --> 16:48.300
A device which uses
a unique datawave agitator

16:48.333 --> 16:50.466

There is a thin line
between pleasure and pain.

17:11.233 --> 17:12.383

17:12.416 --> 17:15.200
in the unlikely event
my machine fails
