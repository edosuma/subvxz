WEBVTT

00:18.625 --> 00:21.083
<i>For many, many years,</i>

00:21.166 --> 00:24.000
<i>we have been observing</i>
<i>you Earthlings.</i>

00:27.083 --> 00:29.208
<i>Far before Godzilla appeared,</i>

00:30.000 --> 00:33.333
<i>before the dawn of civilization,</i>

00:33.416 --> 00:37.916
<i>we continuously intervened</i>
<i>in the lives of you Earthlings.</i>

00:38.458 --> 00:42.916
<i>You Earthlings</i>
<i>have been so interesting to observe.</i>

00:44.000 --> 00:49.166
<i>As a result, we know more about you</i>
<i>than you know about yourselves.</i>

00:50.458 --> 00:53.666
<i>In essence,</i>
<i>humans are dependent on each other.</i>

00:54.500 --> 00:59.625
<i>And your ability to be self-determined,</i>
<i>so-called freewill, is very limited.</i>

01:02.541 --> 01:05.625
<i>A god's words could never be</i>
<i>accepted by you humans.</i>

01:06.000 --> 01:08.583
<i>Only the words of other humans</i>
<i>are accepted by humans.</i>

01:09.000 --> 01:14.083
<i>It is for this reason</i>
<i>that a human is required</i>

01:14.416 --> 01:17.208
<i>to reveal a god's will to other humans.</i>

01:18.791 --> 01:21.666
<i>In this case, you humans desire heroes.</i>

01:22.208 --> 01:24.750
<i>Not status, nor reasoning,</i>

01:25.208 --> 01:27.166
<i>but someone who embodies</i>
<i>the spirit of your era</i>

01:27.250 --> 01:28.833
<i>through their beliefs and actions.</i>

01:30.208 --> 01:35.041
<i>Humans will admire that leader,</i>
<i>search for truth in their words,</i>

01:35.958 --> 01:40.083
<i>and discover God in what they gaze at.</i>

01:42.458 --> 01:46.208
<i>Therefore, there is no need to persuade</i>
<i>all humanity to enter heaven's gates.</i>

01:47.166 --> 01:51.041
<i>If just one person, a hero, shows the way,</i>

01:51.875 --> 01:55.333
<i>all of you will follow.</i>
<i>I've searched and waited.</i>

02:03.416 --> 02:07.750
<i>A hero, shaped by human history,</i>

02:08.208 --> 02:10.750
<i>will eventually appear to lead the way.</i>

02:12.333 --> 02:13.375
<i>That's right.</i>

02:14.000 --> 02:15.958
<i>I've been waiting for you...</i>

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
<i>Haruo.</i>

03:26.625 --> 03:28.916
I can't detect its life signs.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.291
Is it dead?

03:30.375 --> 03:33.458
No. The electromagnetic pulses
inside its body are still strong.

03:33.541 --> 03:36.666
They have slowed down,
but the overall waveform is stable.

03:37.791 --> 03:39.125
It's only sleeping.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.500
Probably just saving power
for its next awakening.

03:45.375 --> 03:47.333
What was the point of it, in the end?

03:47.416 --> 03:49.000
I mean, Godzilla's existence.

03:49.791 --> 03:51.541
Don't you remember?

03:51.625 --> 03:54.291
How was this monster born
in the 20th century?

03:55.208 --> 03:58.083
Humanity's nuclear bomb experiments...

03:58.416 --> 04:02.208
Humanity's foolish actions
created this monster.

04:02.291 --> 04:03.916
That's what we were taught.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.125
-But maybe it was the opposite.
-The opposite?

04:06.750 --> 04:09.458
Let's think of the Earth
as a massive ecosystem.

04:09.541 --> 04:13.125
Imagine if all the technologies
that humans had created till now

04:13.208 --> 04:16.291
weren't really
developed to serve our own ends,

04:16.375 --> 04:19.375
but to breathe life into that monster...

04:19.458 --> 04:21.000
That's another way to think about it.

04:22.166 --> 04:24.875
What if humans were merely the opening act

04:25.041 --> 04:27.583
to the creation of Godzilla,
the ultimate life form?

04:27.666 --> 04:30.000
What? That's...

04:38.000 --> 04:40.833
Never say that
in front of Captain Sakaki...

04:41.208 --> 04:45.625
As a human myself,
I don't want to accept it either.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.833
<i>All monsters, and Godzilla,</i>
<i>are called monsters</i>

04:49.916 --> 04:53.250
<i>because they cannot be defeated by people.</i>

04:54.125 --> 04:56.708
<i>Defeating</i>
<i>what has surpassed</i> <i>human intellect</i>

04:56.791 --> 05:00.083
<i>is no longer within the category</i>
<i>of human achievement.</i>

05:01.500 --> 05:05.750
<i>From the moment you decided</i>
<i>that you'll defeat Godzilla,</i>

05:05.833 --> 05:09.250
<i>you were aspiring to become something</i>
<i>that is no longer human, Haruo!</i>

05:11.875 --> 05:15.250
<i>You're wrong! I...</i>

05:15.333 --> 05:17.666
<i>If you want to win,</i>
<i>then steel your resolve!</i>

05:17.750 --> 05:21.666
<i>You'll surpass humanity and Godzilla,</i>
<i>and become something greater!</i>

05:25.250 --> 05:28.208
<i>Haruo!</i>

05:30.083 --> 05:33.208
There are no more transmissions
from Mechagodzilla City after this one.

05:33.791 --> 05:36.541
Godzilla has once again
entered a dormant state.

05:37.375 --> 05:39.875
That traitor...

05:40.416 --> 05:42.250
We were so close!

05:42.750 --> 05:45.291
Captain Sakaki
should be sentenced to death!

05:45.375 --> 05:47.125
Thanks to that bastard's actions,

05:47.500 --> 05:51.083
we lost our one and only chance
to defeat Godzilla!

05:51.625 --> 05:53.875
What would have happened
after we defeated Godzilla?

05:55.291 --> 05:59.541
What on Earth
would that city-scaled nanomachine

05:59.625 --> 06:01.833
have done to Earth's environment?

06:02.333 --> 06:06.291
A new era of prosperity
lay in store for us, of course!

06:06.375 --> 06:09.708
A new future, in which all will be led
by the Bilusaludo's ultimate wisdom!

06:10.250 --> 06:13.958
And for some mere personal belief, he...

06:14.041 --> 06:17.541
I could say the same about you!

06:18.000 --> 06:20.750
Becoming a monster
fused with a machine?

06:21.125 --> 06:25.333
You call that prosperity?
What is that if not your personal belief?

06:25.416 --> 06:26.583
What?

06:26.666 --> 06:29.166
Are you as delusional as Sakaki?

06:29.250 --> 06:33.750
Captain, Lieutenant Colonel
Mulu-elu Galu-gu's actions

06:33.833 --> 06:35.625
were clearly rebellious.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.625
Captain Sakaki should be acknowledged
for stopping him!

06:39.708 --> 06:42.000
Cut the crap, you Earthlings!

06:42.583 --> 06:46.458
Who on Earth do you think
has helped you live this long?

06:46.541 --> 06:48.375
Just because you helped,
does that mean

06:48.458 --> 06:50.541
you have the right
to give us life or death?

06:50.625 --> 06:53.125
Even those who did not volunteer
were forced to undergo

06:53.208 --> 06:55.166
the nanometal procedure,
which is inexcusable!

06:55.250 --> 06:58.208
That was a necessary measure
to defeat Godzilla!

06:58.291 --> 07:00.458
Can you not see
the gravity of the situation?

07:00.541 --> 07:03.500
What I see is Mechagodzilla's true form!

07:03.583 --> 07:06.625
It is the Bilusaludo's weapon
for the invasion of Earth!

07:06.708 --> 07:10.291
Aren't we fighting a common enemy?

07:19.125 --> 07:22.250
It's no good. There's nothing I can do.

07:22.666 --> 07:24.541
But... her heart is beating.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.041
She's alive, right?

07:27.250 --> 07:31.083
Thanks to the nanometal.
What a frightening technology.

07:31.416 --> 07:36.541
The same metal that's eroding her body
is acting like a life-support machine.

07:37.333 --> 07:39.083
She'll probably live on.

07:39.875 --> 07:41.000
But that's all.

07:41.916 --> 07:44.166
She'll never open her eyes again.

07:44.250 --> 07:45.833
We'll return to the Aratrum.

07:45.916 --> 07:48.291
They must have
some more advanced treatments!

07:48.375 --> 07:50.541
Her brain has stopped functioning.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.958
Captain... She is already...

08:01.333 --> 08:02.708
So, this is where you were.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.875
What did the others say?

08:05.416 --> 08:06.625
They are arguing.

08:07.041 --> 08:09.208
Retreat is out of the question for now.

08:09.291 --> 08:10.333
What?

08:10.416 --> 08:15.125
Captain Sakaki, opinions are split
regarding how you will be dealt with.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.125
Judging by Dolu-do, it seems like
the Bilusaludo faction suggested

08:19.208 --> 08:20.625
to condemn your actions.

08:21.708 --> 08:24.833
Because we were only a step away
from beating Godzilla?

08:25.291 --> 08:26.458
That's right.

08:26.541 --> 08:29.708
If you'd had cooperated
with Galu-gu and the Bilusaludo,

08:29.791 --> 08:32.000
Godzilla might have been beaten.

08:32.333 --> 08:33.875
However, if you had done that,

08:33.958 --> 08:36.791
you would have had
to desert Sergeant Tani,

08:37.250 --> 08:41.083
and you'd probably have had
to become a monster yourself.

08:41.666 --> 08:44.916
Not in body, but in mind.

08:46.625 --> 08:49.500
Captain Sakaki
has a strong sense of humanity.

08:49.583 --> 08:52.708
That's why we didn't beat Godzilla.
Is that what you're trying to say?

08:53.166 --> 08:57.916
Galu-gu said that if we don't throw away
our humanity, we'll never defeat Godzilla.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.666
In the end, we agreed with him
in a paradoxical way...

09:01.750 --> 09:03.583
I disagree.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.916
Because Haruo chose
not to throw away his humanity,

09:07.541 --> 09:11.208
the birth of the Bilusaludo's Godzilla
has been hindered.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.166
Why was I the only one saved?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.041
Yuko...

09:17.791 --> 09:19.625
-That's...
-It's a miracle!

09:20.375 --> 09:23.833
Captain, don't you think
there's some deeper meanings there?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
What?

09:26.083 --> 09:29.833
The Bilusaludo were arrogant
and turned their backs on God.

09:29.916 --> 09:32.625
Yuko, who was taken in by them,
is also dead.

09:32.708 --> 09:33.958
She was punished for her sin!

09:38.291 --> 09:41.833
But you were protected by something
and survived.

09:41.916 --> 09:44.125
And saved us all!

09:44.208 --> 09:46.125
This must be grace.

09:46.208 --> 09:49.875
A divine revelation
that the choice you made was right!

10:00.208 --> 10:01.500
You guys...

10:01.583 --> 10:04.458
Everyone was enlightened
by going through this trial.

10:04.875 --> 10:06.791
For our great god's intentions.

10:08.166 --> 10:11.541
Up until now,
I'd never given it much thought.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.416
But now I have no doubts.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.708
Our god is protecting all of us, Captain.

10:19.125 --> 10:22.291
He hears our prayers of fighting Godzilla!

10:36.166 --> 10:37.250
Yuko...

10:41.166 --> 10:43.541
If you want to win,
then steel your resolve!

10:43.625 --> 10:46.833
You'll surpass humanity and Godzilla
and become something greater!

10:49.375 --> 10:50.500
I...

10:53.041 --> 10:54.125
I can't do it.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.666
This is the place
of the God of the Houtua.

11:13.333 --> 11:15.875
You need permission to enter.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.333
Ah, is that so?

11:19.750 --> 11:22.583
I'm sorry. I think I'm lost.

11:31.500 --> 11:35.291
In the end, this Vulture
was the only thing we recovered.

11:35.375 --> 11:38.500
But when the control unit was taken down,

11:38.583 --> 11:41.791
it received an emergency stop signal
and the commands were locked.

11:42.375 --> 11:44.625
When we try to reboot it,
it won't even connect with electricity.

11:45.166 --> 11:47.958
Are the functions
of the nanometal itself frozen?

11:48.333 --> 11:51.625
I wonder how Belu-be managed to reboot it.

11:51.708 --> 11:54.208
They never shared that with us.

11:55.083 --> 11:58.083
Even if we tried to analyze it,
Mechagodzilla City's remains

11:58.166 --> 12:01.083
have structurally broken down
due to extreme heat.

12:02.208 --> 12:03.666
It's hopeless.

12:06.333 --> 12:10.416
Sokolov and I both touched
the nanometal at the same time.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.208
He was engulfed by it
in just a second.

12:14.291 --> 12:15.125
But I...

12:15.208 --> 12:18.125
Look, I got it on this part of my arm.

12:18.208 --> 12:19.291
But nothing happened.

12:20.041 --> 12:22.041
Sokolov was done for,

12:22.125 --> 12:24.458
but I was able to shake it off easily.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.458
It can't be explained. Right?

12:26.541 --> 12:29.000
-That's right.
-It's a miracle.

12:31.458 --> 12:34.416
Exactly. It is an undeniable miracle.

12:34.916 --> 12:39.500
Both Captain Sakaki and I
have been blessed.

12:39.583 --> 12:42.791
Captain Sakaki, do you have a minute?

12:44.291 --> 12:47.625
It seems like there were people
who failed to escape

12:47.708 --> 12:49.833
and didn't suffer erosion
from the nanometal.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.250
Really?

12:51.875 --> 12:54.375
They all have something in common.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.291
I'm amazed
they're all calling this a miracle.

12:57.375 --> 13:01.333
Everyone in Mechagodzilla City
complained about poor physical health

13:01.416 --> 13:03.458
and received
a medical examination from me.

13:04.416 --> 13:07.041
So did you, Captain.

13:07.125 --> 13:10.083
So, the thing they have in common
that you're talking about is...?

13:10.166 --> 13:13.250
Everyone got medical treatment
in Houtua village.

13:13.750 --> 13:15.541
Perhaps Houtua's medical techniques

13:15.958 --> 13:20.166
include an anti-nanometal-erosion
antibody of sorts.

13:21.500 --> 13:25.041
If that's the case,
why aren't you telling everyone?

13:25.375 --> 13:28.458
Do you think I could do so
in such a situation? No kidding!

13:28.916 --> 13:31.208
If they don't believe us,
they'll probably hang us.

13:31.708 --> 13:36.208
Now most of the survivors
are joining the Exif Cult.

13:36.291 --> 13:38.333
In a place like this,
where we can't escape,

13:38.416 --> 13:40.041
I don't want to become the minority.

13:43.500 --> 13:46.250
Looking back now, our daily lives

13:46.333 --> 13:49.208
were full of miracles.

13:49.291 --> 13:52.041
-I couldn't see a thing.
-Well, about medical supplies,

13:52.125 --> 13:55.000
I'd like to restrict their distribution.
Is that all right, Captain Sakaki?

13:55.083 --> 13:57.875
-Realizing it is a miracle in itself.
-Yes, that's fine.

13:57.958 --> 14:02.708
-I see.
-I understand.

14:03.125 --> 14:04.416
Metphies, a moment please?

14:06.958 --> 14:08.708
Do you mind if we walk and talk?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.291
It's something personal.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.000
Please go ahead first.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.500
So, what's the matter?

14:22.583 --> 14:24.791
The thing that protected us
from the nanometal...

14:24.875 --> 14:26.375
It wasn't a miracle.

14:26.458 --> 14:29.250
Houtua's medical treatment
provided us a special antibody.

14:29.333 --> 14:31.541
Yeah, I guessed so.

14:33.041 --> 14:35.000
You knew it?

14:35.708 --> 14:39.333
How could you make fools
of everyone like that?

14:40.125 --> 14:44.000
Maybe from your viewpoint
I am being dishonest,

14:44.500 --> 14:46.458
but desperate times
call for desperate measures.

14:46.541 --> 14:48.291
I have to do whatever it takes.

14:50.250 --> 14:53.083
Metphies... You...

14:53.916 --> 14:55.833
Let me tell you why.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.916
It is to fight Godzilla once again.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.666
To prepare for the next battle,
we have to unite everyone's hearts.

15:03.750 --> 15:05.458
But... we can't...

15:07.166 --> 15:10.291
defeat Godzilla.

15:11.250 --> 15:13.458
Do you really believe that?

15:13.833 --> 15:15.875
Tell me the exact reason.

15:16.541 --> 15:19.041
Do you really have
no means left to defeat Godzilla?

15:19.125 --> 15:22.541
Or have you just lost
your will to fight Godzilla?

15:24.166 --> 15:27.833
If it's the former,
you can take back what you've just said.

15:28.291 --> 15:30.333
I'll find a way.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.708
Will the god you worship
beat Godzilla for us?

15:35.791 --> 15:37.041
Exactly.

15:38.083 --> 15:40.833
"Sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic."

15:41.375 --> 15:44.708
One of Earth's scientists said that.

15:44.791 --> 15:47.208
How about you think of it like this:

15:47.583 --> 15:51.250
You talk about God in the same breath
as the occult and superstition

15:51.333 --> 15:53.375
because your science

15:53.458 --> 15:56.125
is not sufficiently advanced
to comprehend God.

15:56.208 --> 15:57.208
Wha...?

15:57.916 --> 16:01.666
To us, the existence of God
is purely a mathematical conclusion.

16:02.250 --> 16:06.125
A technology you have yet to discover
called the Gematron Calculation

16:06.208 --> 16:09.625
has allowed us to make contact
with higher-dimensional beings.

16:09.708 --> 16:11.375
Are you serious?

16:11.708 --> 16:15.041
Yes. And just like humans rely
on strategy and tactics,

16:15.125 --> 16:18.083
and like the Bilusaludo
rely on engineering,

16:18.750 --> 16:23.291
we Exif rely on our god
to defeat Godzilla.

16:23.375 --> 16:27.416
Don't talk nonsense! Why wait until now?

16:27.500 --> 16:30.625
If your great god
is going to solve everything,

16:30.708 --> 16:32.958
what's the meaning
of all those sacrifices we've made?

16:33.041 --> 16:35.041
Did everyone die for no reason?
I've had no choice but to wait...

16:38.666 --> 16:40.208
for the time to be ripe.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.458
The anger that burns in your heart now,

16:44.541 --> 16:46.875
the hatred you have against Godzilla,

16:46.958 --> 16:49.958
will someday become prayers
and reach the god.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.166
That's why I've been waiting...

16:52.666 --> 16:55.458
for the time when your hatred for Godzilla

16:55.541 --> 16:59.000
overcomes your doubt about God.

17:00.416 --> 17:04.416
If I join your religion,
will I be able to defeat Godzilla?

17:04.750 --> 17:05.875
Don't mock me!

17:05.958 --> 17:08.458
Is that how you tricked
Adam and the others?

17:08.541 --> 17:10.750
It can only be you, Haruo.

17:11.208 --> 17:13.458
If you welcome God to this world,

17:13.541 --> 17:16.166
you'd be the best one
to stand at the altar.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.083
Why me?

17:19.166 --> 17:22.416
You are more noble and proud
than anyone else,

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
and you did not question
how people ought to be.

17:26.333 --> 17:28.125
That's why you caught my eye.

17:28.791 --> 17:31.250
The one who truly hates Godzilla

17:31.333 --> 17:33.500
and the hero to stand in front of God.

17:34.125 --> 17:37.375
I told you that before, Haruo.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.041
Aratrum is maintaining
a geosynchronous orbit.

17:52.125 --> 17:54.541
Due to the Bilusaludo engineers' boycott,
the gravity-coil engine's efficiency
was decreased.

17:57.500 --> 18:01.708
Right when we had to consider
withdrawing from the Earthsphere again...

18:02.041 --> 18:04.166
Admiral, we are out of time.

18:04.791 --> 18:08.083
We must decide how to handle
Captain Sakaki's case.

18:10.916 --> 18:12.625
-This is an emergency.
-What's happened?

18:12.708 --> 18:14.916
<i>-Captain Mori!</i>
-Dolu-do.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.916
<i>Tell this to the members</i>
<i>of the Central Committee!</i>

18:17.250 --> 18:19.708
<i>In response to your insulting attitude,</i>

18:20.250 --> 18:25.958
<i>we, the Bilusaludo, now exert the right</i>
<i>to issue an objection by force!</i>

18:27.375 --> 18:31.666
<i>In repayment for our comrades</i>
<i>who died in Mechagodzilla City,</i>

18:31.750 --> 18:35.458
<i>you must make Haruo Sakaki</i>
<i>take ultimate responsibility.</i>

18:36.291 --> 18:38.500
<i>Until you agree to this demand,</i>

18:38.833 --> 18:42.791
<i>we will shut off the power of the Aratrum.</i>

18:51.708 --> 18:54.333
Dolu-do, you would go this far?

18:55.083 --> 18:58.000
The Bilusaludo are
a minority on the committee.

18:58.083 --> 19:02.166
Justifying the Mechagodzilla incident
is a matter of life and death.

19:02.833 --> 19:06.166
-What is the status of the backup battery?
-Operational.

19:06.250 --> 19:10.125
But the residential circulation system
can't be maintained more than 48 hours.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.625
Call the security forces immediately!

19:12.708 --> 19:15.208
We need to devise a strategy
to recapture the power station!

19:15.291 --> 19:18.458
Wait! Do you intend
to exacerbate our problems further?

19:18.541 --> 19:20.250
This is a full-fledged revolt!

19:20.625 --> 19:23.250
This is no longer just an issue
of Captain Sakaki alone.

19:23.875 --> 19:25.375
If we give in to such intimidation,

19:25.833 --> 19:30.833
we will be handing over all initiative
to the Bilusaludo from now on!

19:35.625 --> 19:38.291
Ah, so there you are.

19:38.958 --> 19:40.916
Metphies lost his mind.

19:41.833 --> 19:43.583
It's as if my words can't reach him.

19:43.666 --> 19:45.333
Well, as a man of religion,

19:45.416 --> 19:48.583
I guess you could say
that he's back on his right path.

19:50.166 --> 19:52.916
For any missionary,
this is a great opportunity.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.666
People are desperate after seeing
that even Mechagodzilla is powerless.

19:56.958 --> 20:01.625
They can only escape despair
by clinging to God.

20:01.708 --> 20:03.708
But is it right for us
to just let them be?

20:03.791 --> 20:05.458
Regardless of whether it's right or wrong,

20:05.541 --> 20:08.375
we don't have the right
to tell them what they can and can't do.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.416
What do you mean?

20:10.500 --> 20:12.041
It's a tricky situation.

20:12.125 --> 20:16.708
Metphies has switched
the incident at Mechagodzilla City

20:16.791 --> 20:19.208
from your liability issue
to a religious miracle.

20:19.291 --> 20:23.041
And so, Captain Sakaki has gone
from being a trustworthy leader

20:23.125 --> 20:26.041
to some sort of altar decoration.

20:26.375 --> 20:29.083
People here are thankful
for what you've done.

20:29.166 --> 20:31.333
But they don't want to hear
your opinion on anything.

20:31.416 --> 20:34.375
They'll only listen
to what comes out of Metphies' mouth.

20:34.833 --> 20:36.708
The whole thing is entirely on him.

20:38.666 --> 20:41.083
Even if that's true,
what do they want with me?

20:41.166 --> 20:43.875
Oh, yes, I forgot. Come with me.

20:45.541 --> 20:47.041
As of this moment,

20:47.125 --> 20:49.541
a brand-new prayer altar
has been established.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.541
Now, let us honor our god!

20:53.583 --> 20:57.666
Let us pray and believe
that a miracle will befall us!

20:58.625 --> 21:00.083
Through our devotion to our god,

21:00.166 --> 21:03.458
our god will grant us
salvation and blessings.

21:03.916 --> 21:08.000
Let us hope that Garbetrium's guidance
will help us through our struggles.

21:19.083 --> 21:23.291
The thing is, I've just received
contacts from the mother ship.

21:23.375 --> 21:26.625
The Bilusaludos seem to have
taken over Aratrum's power station.

21:26.708 --> 21:27.708
What?

21:28.458 --> 21:32.708
They're shutting off Aratrum's power
until you are sentenced.

21:34.416 --> 21:35.250
And, well...

21:36.250 --> 21:39.458
We think the best way to solve this...

21:40.458 --> 21:43.583
is to have you vanish for a while.

21:43.666 --> 21:46.416
It will appear as if you've escaped.

21:46.791 --> 21:49.958
-Wha...?
-I hate to do this,

21:50.041 --> 21:54.583
but it's the only way
to protect you and calm things down.

21:54.666 --> 21:56.291
If you deviate from regulations

21:56.375 --> 21:59.583
so much that even Mori can't defend you,

21:59.666 --> 22:03.250
we might be able to reach a compromise
in negotiation with Dolo-du.

22:03.333 --> 22:04.916
But if that's the case...

22:05.000 --> 22:08.250
I know. It doesn't solve
any foundational problems,

22:08.333 --> 22:11.458
but it's enough to buy us some time
until everyone cools down.

22:13.291 --> 22:14.458
Miana... Why...

22:15.333 --> 22:17.166
This girl is going to help you out.

22:17.625 --> 22:21.250
I'm not sure to what extent
she understands my instructions, but...

22:22.875 --> 22:25.583
Haruo. Hide. Safe.

22:25.666 --> 22:29.041
Uh... Yes... I guess that'll do.

22:30.541 --> 22:34.958
Captain, if you stay here,
you will be used for Metphies's own ends.

22:35.708 --> 22:39.166
There are times when doing nothing
is the best course of action.

22:39.666 --> 22:41.208
You must be patient for now.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.125
I understand.
Haruo?

23:04.875 --> 23:08.333
Painful... Sadness... Why?

23:10.416 --> 23:14.500
I... wanted to defeat Godzilla.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
My chance was right there in front of me.

23:20.458 --> 23:23.416
But somehow...
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.250
In the past, humans lost to Godzilla.

23:29.333 --> 23:33.125
You survived, but lost your civilizations.

23:33.208 --> 23:35.000
And for us who escaped,

23:35.083 --> 23:37.666
we lost something even greater.

23:38.916 --> 23:43.250
If I have the courage
to stand up against Godzilla again,

23:43.750 --> 23:47.125
I thought I would
be able to take something back.

23:48.208 --> 23:52.666
But in the end, humans continue
to fight amongst each other.

23:53.291 --> 23:55.166
They turn a blind eye towards reality.

23:55.250 --> 23:57.625
And now I don't even have a place to be.

23:59.750 --> 24:02.041
For what reason did I go this far?

24:06.791 --> 24:12.000
You, me, not lose.

24:12.875 --> 24:15.000
We won, so we are here.

24:18.583 --> 24:20.416
Are you trying to cheer me up?

24:22.416 --> 24:26.458
You wanted to lose for a long time.

24:27.250 --> 24:32.583
So, what do you consider a win or a loss?

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
Win is survive. Live on. Connect life.

24:40.083 --> 24:44.125
Loss is die, disappear.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
To challenge Godzilla.

24:49.583 --> 24:52.666
Haruo must win.

24:54.083 --> 24:59.583
From now on, with us, together.

25:03.541 --> 25:04.375
What?

25:07.500 --> 25:11.958
I can connect life.

25:16.416 --> 25:18.125
Why would you do that?

25:18.500 --> 25:21.000
Accept visitors. Learn them.

25:21.750 --> 25:23.541
Our role.

25:31.833 --> 25:34.833
It's all right.
You don't have to go that far.

25:40.208 --> 25:42.083
Can you let me rest?

25:42.166 --> 25:45.500
Here, I can sleep without any worries.

26:14.333 --> 26:16.750
<i>Current standby power is at 43%.</i>

26:17.541 --> 26:20.041
Due to the malfunction
of some onboard circulation systems,

26:20.125 --> 26:22.791
we have consumed
more energy than expected.

26:22.875 --> 26:25.000
-Agitation is spreading within the ship.
-What should we do?

26:25.083 --> 26:27.583
Damn the Bilusaludo...
What the hell are the higher-ups doing?

26:27.666 --> 26:29.666
We should not fear the darkness.

26:30.666 --> 26:33.375
We must utilize the light
of the human spirit and shine it forth.

26:34.166 --> 26:38.208
If we have faith, we can step forward
even with our eyes firmly shut.

26:38.583 --> 26:42.583
Without hesitation or fear, we must pray.

26:43.625 --> 26:45.916
Peace lies therein.

26:49.250 --> 26:52.333
<i>Everything is ready.</i>

26:52.416 --> 26:54.083
<i>Our sons.</i>

26:54.166 --> 26:55.458
<i>Good.</i>

26:55.541 --> 26:58.375
<i>I only need to add</i>
<i>the finishing touches</i> <i>to this ritual.</i>

26:59.000 --> 27:01.666
<i>The alliance of the stars is as revealed.</i>

27:02.250 --> 27:05.500
<i>However, there were</i>
<i>many</i> <i>unexpected plans.</i>

27:06.333 --> 27:10.500
<i>Excuse me, but I must say that I feel</i>
<i>preparations could have gone smoother.</i>

27:11.125 --> 27:15.208
<i>No, in order to ensure</i>
<i>the offering</i> <i>is</i> <i>perfect,</i>

27:15.541 --> 27:18.083
<i>there is more</i>
<i>preparation yet to be done.</i>

27:18.625 --> 27:21.541
<i>We are only after a single Earthling.</i>

27:21.625 --> 27:24.041
<i>Are all these preparations</i>
<i>really necessary?</i>

27:24.416 --> 27:27.000
<i>He is that valuable for us.</i>

27:27.083 --> 27:31.291
<i>For he is qualified to lead us</i>
<i>towards true glory.</i>

27:31.666 --> 27:34.500
<i>Is that why you told the sacred name</i>

27:34.583 --> 27:36.916
<i>to an alien who is not even Exif?</i>

27:37.416 --> 27:40.875
<i>When the time comes,</i>
<i>he will offer his soul to God</i>

27:41.375 --> 27:43.333
<i>and praise his name.</i>
<i>Proceed as you wish.</i>

27:46.750 --> 27:48.916
<i>May the guidance of Garbetrium</i>

27:49.000 --> 27:51.958
<i>be with you.</i>

27:52.041 --> 27:57.666
<i>Praise the god. All will continue</i>
<i>down the path to devotion.</i>

28:01.750 --> 28:03.791
<i>Do not hide in such a place.</i>

28:04.666 --> 28:06.666
<i>Why don't you show yourself?</i>

28:19.333 --> 28:20.791
That time...

28:21.875 --> 28:26.916
I was undressed
because I was being treated.

28:28.125 --> 28:30.291
Miana must have already...

28:31.208 --> 28:36.166
found the switch to unlock the suit.

28:40.166 --> 28:43.375
You are... Maina?

28:48.250 --> 28:54.000
I see... So, it was you...

29:12.250 --> 29:13.791
But... why?

29:16.083 --> 29:18.458
Because scared.

29:21.458 --> 29:25.000
You look like lose.

29:26.333 --> 29:30.208
You look like disappear. I'm scared.

29:32.583 --> 29:38.041
So I'll make you win. Connect life.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.083
I see.

29:43.166 --> 29:46.500
I'm scared too.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.708
<i>Now, show yourself.</i>

29:57.625 --> 30:00.750
<i>From the start, you have</i>
<i>been listening to our conversations.</i>

30:00.833 --> 30:02.416
<i>You've heard everything, right?</i>

30:02.791 --> 30:06.125
<i>The words that cannot be heard.</i>
<i>Conversations through telepathy.</i>

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
<i>When did you find that out?</i>

30:09.416 --> 30:12.291
<i>When I noticed you were the only one</i>
<i>who always remained silent.</i>

30:12.666 --> 30:17.583
<i>Whenever you were with us,</i>
<i>you wouldn't even utter a word.</i>

30:18.083 --> 30:19.750
<i>That's not an easy thing to do</i>

30:19.833 --> 30:22.500
<i>if you're not used</i>
<i>to communicating through your mind.</i>

30:24.208 --> 30:26.708
<i>It seems I've overly</i>
<i>made light of you as a regressed race.</i>

30:27.375 --> 30:30.458
<i>Your minds are</i>
<i>more precise</i> <i>than I thought.</i>

30:30.916 --> 30:34.166
<i>Why did you keep your abilities a secret?</i>

30:34.583 --> 30:37.125
<i>To maintain trust, of course.</i>

30:37.625 --> 30:40.541
<i>For other races,</i>
<i>telepathy is considered a threat.</i>

30:41.041 --> 30:42.958
<i>I didn't want them to beware of me.</i>

30:43.291 --> 30:47.791
<i>So you just made them underestimate you</i>
<i>while you secretly read their thoughts?</i>

30:48.250 --> 30:50.958
<i>I don't need to go out of my way</i>

30:51.041 --> 30:53.166
<i>to read the minds of humans or Bilusaludo.</i>

30:53.791 --> 30:57.958
<i>Those tribes who do not know telepathy</i>
<i>are ignorant of people's inner thoughts.</i>

30:58.833 --> 31:04.083
<i>Through their speech and expressions,</i>
<i>they express how they feel openly anyway.</i>

31:04.625 --> 31:08.625
<i>They reveal everything about themselves.</i>
<i>You just need to observe them.</i>

31:09.166 --> 31:12.333
<i>What is it that you desire?</i>

31:15.000 --> 31:19.791
<i>To offer guidance, salvation,</i>
<i>and blessing to those who are lost.</i>

31:20.000 --> 31:21.833
<i>What are you blessing them with?</i>

31:21.916 --> 31:23.875
<i>What will you use to save them?</i>

31:27.291 --> 31:29.500
<i>Where are you guiding these people to...</i>

31:30.333 --> 31:32.541
<i>with all this secrecy?</i>
<i>If I were to tell you that,</i>

31:35.625 --> 31:40.750
<i>I'd have to offer you up as sacrifice too.</i>

31:48.125 --> 31:51.916
Now, get on your knees and pray...

31:54.000 --> 31:56.083
<i>...for the Golden Death.</i>

32:21.000 --> 32:21.916
What are you doing?

32:22.458 --> 32:24.458
I was preparing to entertain you.
The banquet will start soon.

32:27.791 --> 32:28.666
Banquet?

32:29.000 --> 32:33.083
Yes. I'll be inviting
every soul on this planet

32:33.166 --> 32:34.916
to celebrate our blessings.

32:35.458 --> 32:37.250
You are one of our most important guests.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Me?

32:41.333 --> 32:43.541
Now, drink this.

32:45.916 --> 32:46.750
Okay.

32:48.250 --> 32:53.166
Let's say every human in this world
were to disappear completely.

32:53.583 --> 32:59.083
I wonder if Godzilla would be able
to remain the way it is?

32:59.166 --> 33:01.166
What is this?

33:01.250 --> 33:06.083
No, it would only be a giant creature,
but nothing more.

33:06.166 --> 33:09.791
Its power is feared.
Its existence is hated.

33:09.875 --> 33:12.125
He is a monster, because he is cursed.

33:13.000 --> 33:17.291
That's why your existence is so essential.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.083
Godzilla is only Godzilla...

33:21.583 --> 33:26.458
because your hatred is towards it.

33:45.125 --> 33:46.125
Miana...

33:48.958 --> 33:50.000
Maina?

33:50.500 --> 33:55.583
Now... I heard my sister...

33:58.750 --> 34:00.708
She said, "Ghidorah."

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Metphies.

34:31.791 --> 34:35.166
As you can see, the pot is now empty.

34:36.333 --> 34:40.208
However, the soup that was inside
hasn't just vanished.

34:41.208 --> 34:44.041
It has become a part of you.
Part of your flesh and blood.

34:44.541 --> 34:46.791
It has neither deteriorated nor died.

34:46.875 --> 34:51.000
It simply ceased to be soup in a pot.

34:51.875 --> 34:54.000
Combining with something greater,

34:54.333 --> 34:56.416
it is reborn
as something completely new.

34:56.500 --> 35:00.166
That is what I mean by devotion.

35:01.208 --> 35:03.791
But we are not soup.

35:03.875 --> 35:08.250
We can choose who we devote ourselves to.

35:08.791 --> 35:12.083
We just need to think clearly about it.

35:13.833 --> 35:16.625
What is a more desirable devotion?

35:16.708 --> 35:19.625
For example, Colonel Leland
and Captain Sakaki

35:19.708 --> 35:22.958
have devoted themselves
to the goal of humanity's victory.

35:23.458 --> 35:26.416
And although you could consider this
a noble endeavor,

35:26.500 --> 35:28.583
their outcomes failed to meet up.

35:29.083 --> 35:34.625
For it was impossible to defeat Godzilla
with humanity's justice alone.

35:34.708 --> 35:38.791
Then what is the right path to victory?

35:39.291 --> 35:42.333
It's the god!
Only God can defeat Godzilla!

35:42.416 --> 35:47.166
Precisely. The one whose supreme power
surpasses even that of Godzilla.

35:47.250 --> 35:49.416
Our great god.

35:50.291 --> 35:53.333
There is no path to victory...

35:54.083 --> 35:56.708
unless we devote ourselves,
and become one with God.

35:57.416 --> 35:59.166
To be one with our god

35:59.583 --> 36:03.000
is to leave behind any notion
that you are an individual.

36:03.458 --> 36:07.000
With this in mind,
do you accept our god as your savior?

36:07.625 --> 36:10.333
Are you willing
to sacrifice yourselves to him?

36:11.083 --> 36:12.208
Let us pray!

36:12.291 --> 36:16.375
Let us call on the name of God!
Bring death to Godzilla!

36:16.458 --> 36:18.375
And victory to us!

36:18.458 --> 36:20.458
-Agreed!
-Agreed!

36:20.541 --> 36:26.083
Very well... then now,
let us reveal the secret name.

36:39.250 --> 36:41.708
Come forth, the Golden King,

36:42.458 --> 36:44.333
whose name is Ghidorah!

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
The Wings of Death!

36:48.000 --> 36:51.666
Come forth Ghidorah! The Wings of Death!

36:52.125 --> 36:57.250
The almighty Ghidorah!
Come forth! The Wings of Death!

36:57.333 --> 36:59.166
Come forth Ghidorah!

36:59.541 --> 37:01.791
Bring us a glorious end!

37:02.250 --> 37:05.916
Help us achieve ultimate victory
with our flesh and blood!

37:06.333 --> 37:09.875
Oh, great Ghidorah! Bring us victory!

37:09.958 --> 37:11.375
Come forth, Ghidorah!

37:11.458 --> 37:14.625
Help us achieve ultimate victory
with our flesh and blood!

37:58.041 --> 38:02.500
Come forth, Ghidorah!
Bring us to a glorious end!

38:02.916 --> 38:06.458
Come forth Ghidorah! The Wings of Death!

38:07.000 --> 38:11.791
The almighty Ghidorah!
Come forth! The Wings of Death!

38:12.458 --> 38:15.708
Ghidorah! Bring us victory!

38:24.500 --> 38:26.875
A distorted gravity wave
has been detected close to the ship!

38:27.291 --> 38:29.500
What? Is it something other than Godzilla?

38:29.583 --> 38:31.583
Space-time is breaking down!

38:31.916 --> 38:33.875
This is... a singularity!

38:35.125 --> 38:38.208
It... It can't be!
A naturally occurring singularity?

38:38.291 --> 38:39.625
That's impossible!

38:40.000 --> 38:41.875
There's no change on the monitor.

38:41.958 --> 38:43.625
The external monitor signals

38:43.708 --> 38:45.458
have been on loop from 120 seconds ago!

38:46.000 --> 38:47.833
This... This is unexplainable!

38:47.916 --> 38:50.083
Everything was normal until just now!

38:50.166 --> 38:51.625
The interior main frame's
Gematronic calculation circuits

38:51.708 --> 38:54.125
are sending out codes
I've never seen before!

38:54.666 --> 38:55.916
I can't control it!

38:56.000 --> 38:58.375
Is someone trying to hack us?

38:59.333 --> 39:01.750
Come forth, Ghidorah!

39:01.833 --> 39:05.000
Bring us to a glorious end!

39:10.083 --> 39:12.625
The time has come...

39:17.708 --> 39:20.333
The singularity's gravitational field
is expanding, no...

39:20.416 --> 39:21.916
It's moving... No...

39:22.000 --> 39:22.916
What the hell is this?

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
The border of the gravitational field
is changing.

39:25.666 --> 39:28.416
You fool! Give me precise reports!

39:29.000 --> 39:31.083
But I don't know what is going on!
Anyway...

39:31.166 --> 39:33.458
An object more massive
than the singularity is...

39:33.833 --> 39:35.625
is approaching us!

39:35.708 --> 39:37.791
Can't you provide me
with a proper analysis?

39:37.875 --> 39:40.458
All outboard sensors,
thermal response, radio waves,

39:40.541 --> 39:43.583
radiation... the time stamps of the data
are all over the place!

39:43.666 --> 39:48.583
An analysis program has 80%
of all systems spewing run-time errors!

39:48.666 --> 39:50.375
What have you done?

39:50.458 --> 39:53.208
Dolu-do, are you responsible for this?

39:53.291 --> 39:56.750
No! What is happening?

39:59.333 --> 40:00.416
What is it?

40:00.500 --> 40:02.750
Is the cause of the abnormality
internal or external?

40:02.833 --> 40:06.000
It can't be...
Space-time itself is distorting!

40:06.625 --> 40:08.250
Steering systems, navigation systems...

40:08.333 --> 40:10.916
Our systems are being overwritten
by a non-authenticated command.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.750
What is the source of the input signal?

40:13.250 --> 40:16.083
The Gematron calculation crystal
inside the main frame!

40:17.125 --> 40:19.458
This... This is not someone hacking us!

40:19.541 --> 40:22.708
Target coordinate... What is this,
an imaginary number?

40:23.458 --> 40:26.458
Where is this ship being taken?

40:27.166 --> 40:30.000
There is a gravitational field
around the Aratrum! This is impossible!

40:30.083 --> 40:31.541
Ergo region expansion!

40:31.625 --> 40:33.791
We're being dragged to the static limit!

40:34.208 --> 40:37.250
Quickly turn back!
Thrusters to full power!

40:37.583 --> 40:41.625
I'm trying to,
but the steering command won't work!

40:41.708 --> 40:44.750
An anomalous gravitational field
has hit the ship!

40:44.833 --> 40:47.375
External pressure has exceeded

40:47.458 --> 40:49.291
270% of the hull's durability limit.

40:52.500 --> 40:55.791
Cracks in residential blocks
two and three! They're decompressing!

41:02.208 --> 41:04.541
Where is the plasma propeller?
Why won't it ignite?

41:04.625 --> 41:05.916
There is not enough power!

41:06.000 --> 41:09.041
Dolu-do! Restore the power! Hurry!

41:09.125 --> 41:10.583
I'm trying to, but I can't!

41:11.000 --> 41:13.333
<i>What do you mean? Stop kidding me!</i>

41:13.875 --> 41:17.125
Rotational deviation increasing!
The electromagnetic shell will collapse!

41:24.416 --> 41:26.916
Attention, Power Room! Dolu-do, respond!

41:27.000 --> 41:29.791
The power room
was already destroyed 40 seconds ago!

41:29.875 --> 41:32.250
Then what was that transmission just now?

41:32.333 --> 41:33.541
I... I don't know!

41:33.625 --> 41:37.250
All data transmissions
are losing temporal integrity!

41:50.625 --> 41:53.666
No way...
We've lost signs of life on the bridge.

41:55.666 --> 41:59.166
So we're... We're dead?

42:03.458 --> 42:06.708
Why? Why is this...?

42:30.708 --> 42:33.375
Aratrum! Aratrum, please respond!

42:33.458 --> 42:34.458
What exactly happened?

42:34.541 --> 42:38.416
Professor! We can no longer detect
signals from the Aratrum.

42:38.500 --> 42:40.875
And this
gravitational field disturbance...

42:40.958 --> 42:42.958
Could it have been attacked by Godzilla?

42:43.041 --> 42:46.041
No. I can't detect
any attacks from the ground.

43:04.083 --> 43:07.500
What...? What on Earth is going on?

43:08.458 --> 43:11.125
Everybody... go... there...

43:12.250 --> 43:13.666
The lookout tower?

43:15.500 --> 43:16.583
Let's go!

43:20.958 --> 43:24.958
Let me through! Let me through! Excuse me.

43:30.833 --> 43:32.208
This... This is...

43:32.833 --> 43:35.250
What is about to happen?

43:47.000 --> 43:48.708
It's a powerful gravitational field.

43:49.083 --> 43:51.458
So this is where you were, Dr. Martin.

43:51.541 --> 43:52.416
Captain Sakaki!

43:52.500 --> 43:53.833
What's going on?

43:53.916 --> 43:55.583
-Haruo!
-What?

43:56.125 --> 43:58.416
I can hear it from there.

43:58.916 --> 44:00.125
"Ghidorah"...

44:05.500 --> 44:06.958
What's going on over there?

44:09.375 --> 44:12.750
There are faint life signs near that hill.

44:14.250 --> 44:17.125
I'll go there. You stay put.

44:17.208 --> 44:18.083
But...!

44:18.166 --> 44:19.875
What are you on about? Explain yourself!

44:20.166 --> 44:21.708
Metphies is planning something.

44:22.208 --> 44:24.916
Planning? What could he possibly
be planning in this situation...?

44:26.125 --> 44:27.958
You mean he planned all this?

44:28.416 --> 44:29.625
That's what I need to find out.

45:07.166 --> 45:08.416
-Doctor!
-What?

45:08.500 --> 45:09.833
I've detected Godzilla's vibrations!

45:10.208 --> 45:11.041
What did you say?

45:11.458 --> 45:14.541
It's leaving the base of Mt. Fuji
and appears to be headed in our direction!

45:14.625 --> 45:16.541
Godzilla, too, at a time like this?

45:32.708 --> 45:36.125
Updrafts created by this field
have created cumulonimbus clouds.

45:36.875 --> 45:39.333
I can't believe we're seeing this
on planet Earth...

45:39.416 --> 45:41.083
What is causing all of this?

45:41.708 --> 45:44.250
Does it have something to do with the loss
of communication with the Aratrum?

45:44.708 --> 45:47.375
A strong downburst is expected.

45:47.458 --> 45:49.958
Isn't it dangerous to be here?

45:50.333 --> 45:53.333
But Godzilla is approaching the area.
We can't let it roam free!

45:54.333 --> 45:55.291
Look!

45:55.791 --> 45:57.541
Something is coming out of the clouds.

45:58.708 --> 46:01.750
A gas front? No, it's something else...

46:04.583 --> 46:05.875
There's another one!

46:06.833 --> 46:08.333
Over there, too!

46:09.000 --> 46:11.875
-Those rifts...
-What the hell are they?

46:43.541 --> 46:45.375
What is it?

46:52.458 --> 46:54.125
Is that... a monster as well?

46:54.208 --> 46:55.500
That's impossible!

46:55.583 --> 46:58.041
Why has the sensor not detected
a thing that size?

46:58.125 --> 47:00.833
Infrared, radio, magnetic waves...
they're all unresponsive!

47:00.916 --> 47:04.125
The only data I've been able to receive
is the increasing gravitational waves!

47:04.208 --> 47:06.208
Godzilla is the only thing there!

47:06.291 --> 47:09.708
Impossible... We can see it, can't we?

47:11.416 --> 47:13.708
What? A malfunction?

47:14.291 --> 47:16.416
-It isn't working here, either!
-What?

47:16.500 --> 47:18.916
No matter how many times
I try it, it's not working!

47:19.000 --> 47:22.458
Even if I enlarge the search area,
there's no response!

47:24.416 --> 47:25.708
What's going on?

47:33.541 --> 47:35.708
What... is that...?

47:37.250 --> 47:38.583
Even Godzilla...

47:50.000 --> 47:53.333
What are you planning, Metphies?

47:54.208 --> 47:56.916
I'm seeing a sudden spike
in Godzilla's electromagnetic waves!

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
What? Don't tell me
it's going to fight that thing?

48:09.166 --> 48:10.250
The beam curved?

48:14.375 --> 48:17.083
Godzilla's electromagnetic waves
are spiking again.

48:32.083 --> 48:34.500
Did it use gravity waves
to bend the heat ray?

48:34.583 --> 48:36.291
No, it can't be.

48:37.541 --> 48:39.500
Space itself is distorting?

48:39.583 --> 48:42.916
According to the data, the beam
continued in a straight line!

48:43.916 --> 48:46.666
There is no indication
of the beam ever curving.
That monster cannot be seen
on this machine.

48:49.958 --> 48:53.416
It can only be detected with
our eyes and ears.

48:53.500 --> 48:55.291
Are you saying it's a hallucination?

49:23.666 --> 49:26.625
It's passing through it! Could it be
that it has no physical form?

49:26.708 --> 49:28.208
But it bites Godzilla!

49:29.000 --> 49:30.166
It makes no sense!

49:30.250 --> 49:33.500
It can touch, but not be touched?
It's a contradiction!

49:34.000 --> 49:35.958
What happened to the asymmetric shield?

49:36.833 --> 49:39.166
Even nuclear warheads
were ineffective against Godzilla.

49:42.375 --> 49:45.000
Godzilla's internal electromagnetic waves
have dropped dramatically!

49:45.458 --> 49:47.625
But it was only bitten...

49:47.708 --> 49:50.791
There can be no doubt that there's
a shield surrounding Godzilla!

49:50.875 --> 49:53.250
But its waveform hasn't changed at all.

49:53.333 --> 49:55.500
There isn't any indication of it
being damaged!

49:55.583 --> 49:56.666
Then what's happening?

49:57.125 --> 50:00.000
Are we just having some horrible dream?

50:00.583 --> 50:02.833
The gravitational disturbance
is expanding!

50:12.708 --> 50:14.875
Huh? There are three of them now!

50:14.958 --> 50:16.666
What is going on?

50:16.750 --> 50:18.791
Still nothing is showing on the sensor?

50:36.833 --> 50:38.541
It still shows nothing.

50:38.625 --> 50:41.833
All we can see is the abnormal
gravitational field is expanding.

50:41.916 --> 50:43.541
Apart from that,
there is no response at all!

50:43.625 --> 50:47.000
Then... what is that thing?

50:47.666 --> 50:48.625
Ghidorah.

50:49.166 --> 50:50.500
Ghidorah?

50:50.583 --> 50:51.500
Yes.

50:53.625 --> 50:56.291
The one that shall devour all.

50:57.041 --> 51:01.333
The King of the Void.

51:04.750 --> 51:07.666
Metphies? What are you doing here?

51:09.875 --> 51:10.833
Miana!

51:13.458 --> 51:14.541
She's alive.

51:15.208 --> 51:18.083
What is going on?

51:18.833 --> 51:21.250
Did you do all of this?

51:22.166 --> 51:28.250
My mission, handed down across
eternal time, is about to be fulfilled.

51:28.333 --> 51:30.000
Your mission?

51:31.208 --> 51:33.166
I've been waiting for this moment.

51:33.583 --> 51:37.791
Our chance meeting with you,
the long journey through the void.

51:37.875 --> 51:41.541
Everything was for this day of harvest.

51:42.833 --> 51:45.000
Life sprouts from seeds known as planets.

51:45.083 --> 51:48.000
The flower called people
blooms into civilization.

51:48.083 --> 51:50.666
The final fruit of that flower
is Godzilla.

51:51.458 --> 51:56.916
We Exif have seen this cycle occur
on many planets.

51:58.458 --> 52:04.000
And our god is the one
who picks that fruit and eats it.

52:04.916 --> 52:08.750
King Ghidorah. The Golden Death.

52:10.125 --> 52:13.500
This universe only exists
and has value as a tribute

52:13.583 --> 52:17.625
and a sacrifice to Him.

52:19.500 --> 52:23.500
Ghidorah... Isn't that the monster
who destroyed your planet?

52:24.291 --> 52:28.958
We Exif once strove to find
the ultimate truth.

52:29.333 --> 52:33.708
It lead us to make ourselves offerings
and become one with our god.

52:33.791 --> 52:35.125
Offerings?

52:35.916 --> 52:39.916
We handful of priests were left behind

52:40.000 --> 52:42.875
to spread this blessing
across the universe.

52:44.250 --> 52:47.083
You call destruction a blessing?

52:47.625 --> 52:48.791
Yes.

52:50.500 --> 52:54.958
Not only Godzilla,
but also us and this planet...

52:55.041 --> 52:58.375
are you trying to destroy it all
with Ghidorah?

52:59.000 --> 53:03.291
Embrace this demise.
There is no greater blessing.

53:03.750 --> 53:04.625
Don't mess around!

53:16.125 --> 53:19.791
Do not refuse it. Do not lose your way.

53:20.750 --> 53:22.791
Hand yourself over to fate.

53:29.208 --> 53:30.833
Haruo.

53:31.333 --> 53:33.625
Deep down, you too...

53:34.500 --> 53:37.166
must have wished for it.

53:37.541 --> 53:43.708
Cut... the... crap...!

54:02.333 --> 54:04.416
The electromagnetic waves are decreasing.

54:04.500 --> 54:06.916
Godzilla is definitely taking damage!

54:07.000 --> 54:09.916
Godzilla's force field
is definitely activated.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.458
But it's not deflecting the damage!

54:12.541 --> 54:14.375
Even though he's just being bitten?

54:15.208 --> 54:18.958
Those defenses
that caused us so much trouble...

54:41.666 --> 54:45.833
<i>Why... is destruction a blessing?</i>

54:47.000 --> 54:49.833
<i>Our ancestors obtained science</i>
<i>to grant prosperity</i>

54:49.916 --> 54:52.958
<i>and even see into the future.</i>

54:53.458 --> 54:55.000
<i>With it, they sought across time</i>

54:55.083 --> 54:57.916
<i>for the truth of immortality.</i>

54:58.750 --> 55:03.000
<i>It was the proudest age in Exif's history.</i>

55:04.250 --> 55:08.250
<i>They predicted the end of time</i>

55:08.666 --> 55:14.583
<i>and reached a conclusion:</i>
<i>"eternity does not exist."</i>

55:15.666 --> 55:20.250
<i>The universe is finite</i>
<i>and will one day be deceased.</i>

55:21.416 --> 55:25.541
<i>Then we must seek for rest and glory</i>

55:26.208 --> 55:29.000
<i>beyond that final destruction.</i>

55:30.916 --> 55:36.375
I will never accept... such nonsense...

55:37.041 --> 55:41.958
<i>That is all deception, Haruo.</i>
<i>Life is a series of fears.</i>

55:42.041 --> 55:44.958
<i>Release from them and eternal peace</i>

55:45.041 --> 55:47.500
<i>are the longstanding desires</i>
<i>of every being.</i>

55:49.000 --> 55:50.333
You're wrong!

55:50.875 --> 55:55.291
<i>Listen to your heart. Face it.</i>

55:56.125 --> 55:59.583
<i>Face your own true wishes.</i>

56:12.125 --> 56:14.458
Godzilla's body temperature
is rising rapidly!

56:14.875 --> 56:18.166
Is it going to do the same thing
that destroyed Mechagodzilla City?

56:27.791 --> 56:29.875
Godzilla's body temperature
is still rising!

56:30.333 --> 56:32.583
With that much heat,
he could really do some damage

56:32.666 --> 56:34.375
without even making a direct hit.

56:46.541 --> 56:48.666
<i>Since your earliest memories,</i>

56:49.458 --> 56:52.083
<i>you have always been</i>
<i>a prisoner</i> <i>of fear and despair.</i>

56:58.750 --> 57:00.875
<i>At that time, you must have prayed.</i>

57:01.750 --> 57:06.000
<i>"I hate this.</i>
<i>I hope all this would end."</i>

57:07.333 --> 57:08.375
<i>I...</i>

57:15.500 --> 57:16.416
<i>But...</i>

57:19.416 --> 57:22.000
<i>The things that have shaped your life...</i>

57:22.625 --> 57:25.625
<i>are anger and humiliation,</i>

57:26.708 --> 57:29.625
<i>and an inescapable feeling of entrapment.</i>

57:30.791 --> 57:34.250
<i>That's why you have been waiting so long.</i>

57:35.458 --> 57:40.541
<i>Waiting for one day</i>
<i>to be freed from it all.</i>

58:03.000 --> 58:06.375
This can't be!
Godzilla's temperature is now decreasing!

58:06.875 --> 58:08.208
The heat is being absorbed,

58:08.291 --> 58:10.458
even if the molecules
are still vibrating.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.041
No, it's not only that.

58:13.375 --> 58:15.875
It is producing intense heat,
but there's no steam at all.

58:15.958 --> 58:20.041
If Godzilla is cooling down,
why can't we see any water vapor?

58:20.125 --> 58:23.208
But Godzilla is continuing
to generate heat!

58:23.291 --> 58:27.833
Then the heat is just... disappearing?
Where has it all gone?

58:29.333 --> 58:32.125
The molecules have been vibrating quickly!

58:32.208 --> 58:35.375
But the area surrounding Godzilla
is cooling down rapidly.

58:36.916 --> 58:39.458
Its body temperature is also dropping.

58:40.125 --> 58:44.208
Part of Godzilla's body had already
dropped below 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

58:44.291 --> 58:46.041
And it's still dropping!

58:49.666 --> 58:53.083
Perhaps this monster
is from a different universe?

58:54.541 --> 58:57.791
The laws of our world don't apply to it.

58:58.541 --> 59:02.500
Its physical attacks
are from another dimension?

59:03.000 --> 59:06.166
In that case...
could it defeat Godzilla?

59:06.791 --> 59:08.083
This is no joke!

59:08.625 --> 59:10.833
That monster's powers
wouldn't just destroy Godzilla.

59:11.208 --> 59:14.125
It would destroy this planet!

59:24.083 --> 59:27.541
<i>Haruo. You should've remembered...</i>

59:28.208 --> 59:31.791
<i>those who bravely</i>
<i>fulfilled their missions.</i>

59:50.583 --> 59:51.750
Leland.

59:52.625 --> 59:55.208
I fought even though
I had to throw away my life.

59:56.541 --> 59:58.291
Why didn't you avenge me?

59:59.208 --> 1:00:02.666
Why didn't you offer your life too?

1:00:02.750 --> 1:00:06.458
-Stop...
-Ghidorah can defeat him.

1:00:08.041 --> 1:00:09.208
Yuko...

1:00:09.291 --> 1:00:12.041
Do you want to live on that badly?

1:00:13.500 --> 1:00:15.333
So you can live with those girls?

1:00:16.375 --> 1:00:20.458
Even though you've turned me into this...?

1:00:20.541 --> 1:00:21.791
Please... Just stop...

1:00:22.541 --> 1:00:25.916
Many people sacrificed their lives
in the battle against Godzilla.

1:00:26.750 --> 1:00:30.291
Yet the only one left standing
is you, Haruo.

1:00:31.541 --> 1:00:36.375
It's time for you to listen to them
and settle this once and for all.

1:00:37.041 --> 1:00:42.541
Everyone who fought Godzilla before
did so for the sake of mankind!
They didn't want to destroy this planet
along with Godzilla.

1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.000
Godzilla is floating?

1:01:20.708 --> 1:01:25.750
How can something so heavy
float like that?

1:01:25.833 --> 1:01:30.833
This monster is from another dimension.
Godzilla is totally powerless!

1:01:30.916 --> 1:01:34.958
Then how is this monster able
to interfere with our dimension?

1:01:35.291 --> 1:01:36.458
What are the conditions?

1:01:37.333 --> 1:01:40.750
There isn't any way
of proving their existence.

1:01:41.375 --> 1:01:43.833
That would explain a lot
if it were just an illusion.

1:01:44.208 --> 1:01:46.583
Yet, Ghidorah's fang
has made contact with Godzilla.

1:01:46.666 --> 1:01:49.541
From Ghidorah's perspective,
Godzilla is not an illusion.

1:01:49.625 --> 1:01:52.208
The monster is determining
Godzilla's existence...

1:01:52.958 --> 1:01:54.833
Our enemy is not Ghidorah!

1:01:54.916 --> 1:01:59.083
Someone in our universe is guiding it!

1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:04.000
<i>I see... It must be Metphies.</i>

1:02:05.708 --> 1:02:07.625
<i>I have to tell Captain Sakaki.</i>

1:02:13.916 --> 1:02:17.458
We need to go together to save Haruo.

1:02:17.791 --> 1:02:20.708
He is fighting with Ghidorah too!

1:02:34.541 --> 1:02:37.666
<i>On many planets,</i>
<i>civilizations at the peak of prosperity</i>

1:02:38.458 --> 1:02:41.125
<i>will eventually enter a forbidden zone.</i>

1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:47.166
<i>When the door is opened,</i>
<i>a monster lets out its birth cry.</i>

1:02:54.333 --> 1:02:56.583
Once a civilization
gives birth to Godzilla,

1:02:57.166 --> 1:03:02.333
it is doomed to destruction.

1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:08.333
The question is, how should it
accept that destruction?

1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:15.416
Don't you think it should stand
resolutely proud to the very end?

1:03:25.833 --> 1:03:29.666
Are you saying
we created a civilization...

1:03:30.708 --> 1:03:32.750
just to destroy it?

1:03:33.666 --> 1:03:36.750
But that's not something
you should dwell on with sadness.

1:03:36.833 --> 1:03:41.250
Our universe is finite.
This is a natural conclusion.

1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:46.416
That is why us primates must explore

1:03:47.500 --> 1:03:51.708
what lies beyond death and destruction.

1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:00.958
It can't be... It's not just Ghidorah.

1:04:01.041 --> 1:04:03.791
Even Godzilla's measurements
are becoming ambiguous.

1:04:04.791 --> 1:04:07.875
Is reality being eroded?

1:04:19.958 --> 1:04:23.625
Is this the God of the Houtua?

1:04:25.666 --> 1:04:27.875
<i>Your people's long journey</i>

1:04:28.291 --> 1:04:31.583
<i>was a pilgrimage</i>
<i>to face your own destruction.</i>

1:04:32.416 --> 1:04:37.583
Godzilla is a punishment
for endlessly seeking prosperity.

1:04:38.208 --> 1:04:39.916
In order to overcome this ordeal,

1:04:40.500 --> 1:04:46.541
you must purify the souls of mankind
through devotion to something greater.

1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:58.125
O'Egg. A guide to salvation
from abominable dream.

1:04:58.208 --> 1:05:01.041
Deliver this song
to the Passing Crows!

1:05:12.875 --> 1:05:14.291
Damn the blasphemous...

1:05:28.750 --> 1:05:31.375
That's a... moth?

1:05:32.333 --> 1:05:33.375
Haruo!

1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:40.041
Haruo! Do not fear. Listen carefully.

1:05:40.125 --> 1:05:41.208
What...?
Haruo, is that you?

1:05:49.500 --> 1:05:52.416
I am calling you now with Maina's help.

1:05:52.500 --> 1:05:56.458
Ghidorah can only enter this world
because there is a means of observation!

1:05:56.916 --> 1:05:59.541
<i>Someone is acting as Ghidorah's eyes</i>
<i>and watching Godzilla!</i>

1:05:59.625 --> 1:06:01.000
<i>It's probably...</i>

1:06:29.375 --> 1:06:31.791
Why are you showing me all this?

1:06:33.750 --> 1:06:35.750
What do you want me to do?

1:06:36.416 --> 1:06:39.375
Fear makes a monster a monster.

1:06:40.083 --> 1:06:42.583
Hate makes a person a hero.

1:06:43.041 --> 1:06:47.333
And it is a hero's prayer
that makes a god.

1:06:48.583 --> 1:06:51.166
It is you
who did not become a new Godzilla,

1:06:51.250 --> 1:06:55.833
but continued to fight
and curse Godzilla as a human

1:06:56.791 --> 1:06:59.000
who should give praise to our god.

1:06:59.750 --> 1:07:03.000
I want you to use your voice
to call on our god.

1:07:04.333 --> 1:07:07.208
A hero like you offering his soul
as a sacrifice

1:07:07.750 --> 1:07:09.916
will allow Ghidorah's divinity

1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:13.208
at last to firmly take root in this world.

1:07:31.625 --> 1:07:35.041
So, it was you...

1:07:35.916 --> 1:07:40.000
We do not accept life that lives for pain.

1:07:41.083 --> 1:07:46.000
The path to ruin should be peaceful.

1:07:48.541 --> 1:07:49.625
Grandpa.

1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:53.208
We were all saved thanks to this.

1:07:53.875 --> 1:07:57.583
Everybody has fought for too long.

1:07:58.250 --> 1:08:00.875
If we're only living
to receive punishment,

1:08:01.250 --> 1:08:03.625
then ending it all
is the only salvation for us.

1:08:04.541 --> 1:08:08.916
Don't you think so too, Haruo?
But... But I...

1:08:15.916 --> 1:08:17.125
Haruo! Hurry!

1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:30.291
Give praise to the Wings of Destruction.

1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:34.666
Recite the golden name of our god,

1:08:37.333 --> 1:08:42.250
and seek victory and blessings.

1:09:01.333 --> 1:09:03.250
Is this a flower?

1:09:04.041 --> 1:09:08.000
That's right. A flower of spring
I made to protect this precious child.

1:09:08.958 --> 1:09:13.000
One day, even in these times,
spring will come after winter.

1:09:14.208 --> 1:09:16.333
A season of lives reviving.

1:09:16.625 --> 1:09:17.916
That's right.

1:09:18.416 --> 1:09:21.166
That's what we have prayed for
when we named our child.

1:09:21.833 --> 1:09:24.708
That's right. Haruo.

1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.750
You are Haruo, my sweet child.

1:09:31.458 --> 1:09:32.500
That's it.

1:09:35.541 --> 1:09:36.958
That's it.

1:09:51.125 --> 1:09:53.583
There's no comfort for our mistakes.

1:09:53.958 --> 1:09:56.208
Those are only excuses.

1:09:56.916 --> 1:09:59.000
If I give up, it will all be a lie.

1:09:59.083 --> 1:10:00.500
I don't need salvation.

1:10:01.708 --> 1:10:05.000
Haruo... You...

1:10:05.875 --> 1:10:08.958
No matter how small and miserable
my life may be,

1:10:09.833 --> 1:10:16.333
if I were to betray the faith
of everyone who died before me, I...

1:10:42.875 --> 1:10:46.208
What? What's going on?

1:10:46.291 --> 1:10:49.208
Heat source, electromagnetic...
all our sensors detect Ghidorah!

1:10:49.291 --> 1:10:54.083
The gravitational field is decaying...
Amazing... The irregularity

1:10:54.166 --> 1:10:56.583
of the phenomenon has decreased
so much we can get data now!

1:11:37.375 --> 1:11:39.791
Haruo... did you do it?

1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:44.541
The ergosphere region is closing rapidly!

1:12:16.541 --> 1:12:19.833
Ghidorah has finally been captured
by the laws of our universe.

1:12:20.708 --> 1:12:22.500
You can defeat it now, Godzilla!

1:14:38.458 --> 1:14:41.166
Ah, Haruo...

1:14:42.625 --> 1:14:48.041
All that anger and hatred
are burning bright. It's blinding.

1:14:51.333 --> 1:14:52.458
You are...

1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:56.791
Sadness and pain...

1:14:57.375 --> 1:15:01.958
are curses inflicted on all living things.

1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:04.833
Therefore...

1:15:07.041 --> 1:15:08.541
Haruo...

1:15:09.750 --> 1:15:12.166
as long as you can hold on to that life...

1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:16.000
Ghidorah will...

1:15:18.375 --> 1:15:22.708
be watching you...

1:15:24.166 --> 1:15:25.333
Metphies...

1:17:52.333 --> 1:17:53.291
This is...

1:17:54.583 --> 1:17:57.625
The season before the rains,
the season of flowers.

1:17:58.541 --> 1:18:00.291
I wanted to show you, Haruo.

1:18:03.125 --> 1:18:04.583
I see...

1:18:05.500 --> 1:18:08.208
This is spring.

1:18:10.125 --> 1:18:11.916
It's the first time I've seen it,

1:18:12.500 --> 1:18:14.625
even though I bear its name.

1:18:20.333 --> 1:18:21.708
I've been waiting for you, Haruo.

1:18:22.208 --> 1:18:24.500
What did you mean
when you said you needed me urgently?

1:18:24.583 --> 1:18:28.166
I want you to be the first one to see it.

1:18:30.791 --> 1:18:31.958
What are you doing?

1:18:34.208 --> 1:18:36.375
This won't move anymore, right?

1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:38.333
Well, take a look at this.

1:18:41.375 --> 1:18:43.916
I've successfully restarted
the power reactor.

1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:46.583
Now the self-healing system
will also recover.

1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:50.208
I think it will be able to move
by itself come tomorrow morning.

1:18:50.291 --> 1:18:51.291
How?

1:18:51.708 --> 1:18:57.750
I was able to recover samples of nanometal
that are still active from Yuko's body.

1:18:57.833 --> 1:18:59.541
There's not much equipment left,

1:18:59.625 --> 1:19:01.875
so I'm not sure if they can be analyzed,

1:19:01.958 --> 1:19:05.083
but this morning we finally succeeded
in getting the control system to work.

1:19:05.166 --> 1:19:06.791
Do you not get it?

1:19:06.875 --> 1:19:08.916
It's a nanomachine that can self-replicate

1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:11.416
and make unlimited copies
of technologies that it memorized!

1:19:11.916 --> 1:19:14.375
If we can control this in the same way
as the Bilusaludo,

1:19:14.458 --> 1:19:16.958
we can revive past civilizations!

1:19:17.041 --> 1:19:19.958
We'll be saying farewell
to today's primitive lives!

1:19:20.833 --> 1:19:22.625
What's wrong with you, Haruo?

1:19:26.083 --> 1:19:27.541
<i>Exactly.</i>

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:31.583
<i>The insatiable desire for prosperity</i>
<i>is human nature.</i>

1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:36.708
<i>And yet again,</i>
<i>the harvest season will come.</i>

1:19:38.250 --> 1:19:42.000
<i>Time is on our side.</i>

1:19:42.625 --> 1:19:46.750
<i>We only have to wait patiently.</i>

1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:55.250
What's wrong? Haruo?

1:19:55.333 --> 1:19:57.750
Dr. Martin really is a genius!

1:19:57.833 --> 1:20:00.583
Soon, we'll say farewell
to our primitive lifestyle.

1:20:01.625 --> 1:20:04.458
It's surprisingly nice
once you get used to it, though.

1:20:05.250 --> 1:20:07.916
Well, this lifestyle suits you very well.

1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:13.000
Haruo, are you all right?

1:20:15.625 --> 1:20:16.541
I'm fine.

1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:45.916
Well, shall we get going?

1:20:46.583 --> 1:20:48.125
What do you plan on doing?

1:20:49.708 --> 1:20:52.500
Miana, do you find Godzilla scary?

1:20:54.291 --> 1:20:56.750
Yeah... Scary...

1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:00.791
So, I guess you hate it?

1:21:01.541 --> 1:21:02.833
Hate Godzilla?

1:21:03.458 --> 1:21:05.041
Hate?
Godzilla is scary.

1:21:10.625 --> 1:21:13.000
Tornadoes and lightning are scary too.

1:21:14.125 --> 1:21:19.166
But... hate? I don't know.

1:21:20.208 --> 1:21:23.208
There is no such word in Houtua.

1:21:29.666 --> 1:21:33.791
Haruo, you can't go! That's losing!

1:21:34.333 --> 1:21:35.583
I know.

1:21:36.750 --> 1:21:41.500
A life without losing
is no different from a beast.

1:21:43.208 --> 1:21:46.583
But when the time comes,

1:21:47.125 --> 1:21:49.041
we can also choose a losing battle.

1:21:52.250 --> 1:21:55.750
I don't understand.

1:21:56.791 --> 1:21:59.708
It's okay if you never understand.

1:22:01.125 --> 1:22:07.041
Perhaps if I was here
you'd understand one day.

1:22:10.416 --> 1:22:13.375
That's why I've got to go.

1:22:55.458 --> 1:22:57.000
Do you understand, Godzilla?

1:22:57.916 --> 1:23:01.458
From all of those who hated you
and challenged you,

1:23:01.541 --> 1:23:04.208
I am the last one remaining.

1:23:04.625 --> 1:23:06.958
I'm the one
carrying all the lives you took

1:23:07.625 --> 1:23:10.750
and all the dreams you stole.

1:23:11.208 --> 1:23:13.041
I am right here!

1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:21.291
If you really are
the incarnation of destruction...

1:23:23.333 --> 1:23:28.125
then this time, make sure you
burn down everything without any traces!

1:23:29.375 --> 1:23:31.583
Along with all the curses from the past!

1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:09.000
I wish to not get sick.

1:29:09.083 --> 1:29:11.375
I wish to not have bad dreams.

1:29:11.458 --> 1:29:13.541
I wish to not get stung by bugs.

1:29:13.625 --> 1:29:15.666
I wish to not get hurt
from climbing trees.

1:29:15.750 --> 1:29:19.166
Well, everyone,
did you seal all the scary things into it?

1:29:19.583 --> 1:29:20.666
Yes!

1:29:21.541 --> 1:29:24.375
Our Wrathful Lord. Our Wrathful Lord.

1:29:24.458 --> 1:29:27.416
Please purify us again this year.
Please forget the curses with this flame.
