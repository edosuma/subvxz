30:05.542 --> 30:07.022
For the record,

30:07.066 --> 30:08.458
Magnum actually wanted
to call you

30:08.502 --> 30:09.677
as soon as we heard from Kumu.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.592
I was the one
that talked him out of it.

30:21.689 --> 30:23.647
I can buy you two hours.

30:23.691 --> 30:25.475
But after that, every cop

30:25.519 --> 30:27.173
on the island will be
hunting this guy down,

30:27.216 --> 30:29.349
and if Kumu's
still with him...Understood.

30:29.392 --> 30:31.917
Thank you, Gordon.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.875

30:33.919 --> 30:35.921
[phone rings]

30:35.964 --> 30:37.400
Juliet?

30:37.444 --> 30:39.011
[grunts]Yes, I'm okay.

30:39.054 --> 30:41.665
Hold on. Go ahead.

30:41.709 --> 30:43.232
We need the names of
those friends of yours.

30:43.276 --> 30:45.408
It looks like one or maybe
both of them were behind this.

30:45.452 --> 30:46.583
No, that's not possible.

30:46.627 --> 30:48.585
They would never hurt Kalei.

30:48.629 --> 30:49.848
Milo, the money is gone.

30:49.891 --> 30:51.458
So unless one of you
told someone where it is,

30:51.501 --> 30:52.851
it looks like a double-cross.

30:52.894 --> 30:55.157
[breathing heavily]

30:55.201 --> 30:56.680
Give them the names.

30:56.724 --> 30:58.291
Get justice for Kalei.

31:00.336 --> 31:02.382
Ike Chau and Benny Cho.

31:02.425 --> 31:04.297
But if I had to guess
as to which one turned,

31:04.340 --> 31:05.559
it was probably Benny.

31:05.602 --> 31:07.343
Okay. All right,
Benny Cho.

31:07.387 --> 31:09.128
Guy's a drug addict.
[grunts]

31:09.171 --> 31:11.130
He's been
pretty aggressive lately.

31:11.173 --> 31:13.349
What do you mean?MILO: He was getting antsy
about waiting for the money.

31:13.393 --> 31:15.177
Few weeks back,
he came to me and Ike

31:15.221 --> 31:17.136
asking for early withdrawal,

31:17.179 --> 31:18.877
but we talked him out of it.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.313
Milo, where does Benny live?

31:21.357 --> 31:24.752
929 Aihue Lane.

31:24.795 --> 31:27.320
[inhales sharply]Juliet,

31:27.363 --> 31:29.757

Keep us updated.

31:40.594 --> 31:42.901
We need to get you
to a hospital.No.

31:42.944 --> 31:44.728
They know I got hurt
during the escape,

31:44.772 --> 31:47.731
and they'll have HPD
watching the hospitals for sure.

31:47.775 --> 31:49.559
Okay.

31:49.603 --> 31:51.735
I'll do what I can.

31:51.779 --> 31:53.781
[groaning loudly]Sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry.

31:53.824 --> 31:54.825
Okay.

32:06.011 --> 32:08.448
So, uh... how often do you go

32:08.491 --> 32:10.276
for your little walkabout
in the woods?

32:11.320 --> 32:13.148
Once a year.

32:13.192 --> 32:15.803
Around the anniversary
of my husband's death.

32:15.846 --> 32:18.632
He was a good man, huh?

32:18.675 --> 32:19.981
Most of the time.

32:20.025 --> 32:21.461
Oh.

32:21.504 --> 32:24.246
But not always.
He made mistakes.

32:24.290 --> 32:26.422
Ah.

32:26.466 --> 32:28.424
There was a time...

32:28.468 --> 32:30.687
I... I didn't trust him
very much.

32:30.731 --> 32:32.124
What happened?

32:34.865 --> 32:36.693
He was...

32:36.737 --> 32:38.739
unfaithful.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.223
And the woman he was with...

32:44.266 --> 32:46.747
had a child.

32:46.790 --> 32:49.880
A girl. Maleah.

32:49.924 --> 32:51.621
What happened to her?

32:51.665 --> 32:54.102
Her mother raised her.

32:54.146 --> 32:57.584
My husband had a
relationship with her, too,

32:57.627 --> 32:59.629
but I couldn't.

33:00.804 --> 33:02.893
Just being around her would've

33:02.937 --> 33:05.287
just reminded me
of what he had done.

33:06.332 --> 33:08.725
You two ever meet?

33:08.769 --> 33:11.119
No. It crossed my mind.

33:11.163 --> 33:13.208
[sighs heavily]

33:13.252 --> 33:17.691
But I-I just couldn't
accept what he'd done.

33:19.214 --> 33:22.783
Especially since... we never
had children of our own.

33:28.093 --> 33:30.312
I think about her
sometimes, though.

33:31.531 --> 33:34.490
I heard her mother
passed away recently.

33:34.534 --> 33:36.492
Mmm. So she doesn't have anyone?

33:36.536 --> 33:39.365
No parents?

33:39.408 --> 33:41.845
I don't know.

34:36.987 --> 34:38.554
Made it to the car,

34:38.598 --> 34:39.729
but collapsed
before he could escape.

34:39.773 --> 34:40.991
Looks like he was
double-crossed, as well.

34:41.035 --> 34:43.168
Which means we went
after the wrong partner.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.221
MAGNUM:
Kumu, we found Benny.

34:53.265 --> 34:55.528
But he was shot dead, probably
within the last 12 hours.

34:55.571 --> 34:56.790
By who?

34:56.833 --> 34:58.357
We think it was Milo's
other friend-- Ike.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.619
We need to find him.

34:59.662 --> 35:01.621
Do you have any idea
where he may have gone?

35:02.796 --> 35:03.971
I don't know.

35:04.014 --> 35:05.190
HIGGINS:
Look, we need you to think.

35:05.233 --> 35:06.495
You know him.
What would his next move be?

something. Listen to me!

36:30.100 --> 36:31.624
Okay. Okay.

36:31.667 --> 36:34.670
Remember when you asked me
before why I was helping you?

36:34.714 --> 36:36.237
Well, it's because

36:36.281 --> 36:37.804
I believe in second chances.

36:37.847 --> 36:39.719
But I didn't always.

36:39.762 --> 36:41.938
After my husband did
what he did,

36:41.982 --> 36:44.854
it took a long time
for me to forgive him.

36:44.898 --> 36:46.856
To realize that...

36:46.900 --> 36:49.250
people make mistakes,

36:49.294 --> 36:51.470
and you can't just
give up on them.

36:51.513 --> 36:53.646
Today,

36:53.689 --> 36:57.650
you confirmed
that I made the right choice.

36:57.693 --> 36:59.869
So...

36:59.913 --> 37:01.567
I wasn't just helping you.

You helped me.

You're proof
that good people make mistakes.

37:07.703 --> 37:09.575

to help them out.

Yes, I do.

If you really believe that,

37:20.934 --> 37:24.024
isn't there somebody else...
