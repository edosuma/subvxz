isn't there a way for
you to open the vault

05:29.900 --> 05:33.667
As long as the containment

no one can open it.

it's being opened.

05:56.933 --> 05:58.300

Last time it was a hair
under six hours. Allegedly.

There's an abandoned mineshaft

This roof is like a loaded
spring. Be careful, Scott.

(RUMBLING)

15:24.133 --> 15:25.900
(BEEPING)

15:25.967 --> 15:27.500
(ALARMS WAIL)

15:34.800 --> 15:36.700
Did what I think just
happen actually happen?

15:36.767 --> 15:40.267
You mean, did the outer
doors just slam shut,

15:40.333 --> 15:42.267
trapping us inside?

15:42.333 --> 15:44.467
I'm afraid so, m'lady.

15:44.533 --> 15:46.567
Well, that's
rather distressing.

15:49.067 --> 15:51.100
ALICE: The inner vault
is still secure, Colonel.

15:51.167 --> 15:54.400
It will contain the
anti-matter when it implodes.

15:54.467 --> 15:57.467
Leave me in here.
It's the only option.

15:57.533 --> 16:00.500
If I've learned anything
from International Rescue,
Professor,

16:00.567 --> 16:02.867
it's that there's never
an "only" option.

16:02.933 --> 16:04.900
VIRGIL: My thoughts
exactly, Colonel.

16:04.967 --> 16:08.133
We're getting this vault
out of the city and getting
you out of that vault.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.700
All of you.

16:09.767 --> 16:12.933
-Well, Parker?
-It'll be close.
But we could do it.

16:13.067 --> 16:16.100
Only the inner vault can
contain the implosion.
Once you open it,

16:16.167 --> 16:17.433
no one will be safe.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.300
One problem at a time,
Professor.

16:26.300 --> 16:28.067
When they built these vaults,

16:28.100 --> 16:29.800
they always assumed

16:29.867 --> 16:34.367
anyone who tried to
break in would take
the high tech approach.

16:34.433 --> 16:38.533
Never counted on a good
old-fashioned bump and twist.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.933
X marks the spot, m'lady.

16:43.067 --> 16:44.300
I see.

16:49.067 --> 16:51.133
I sure hope you're as good
at breaking out of vaults

16:51.200 --> 16:52.833
as you are at breaking in.

16:52.900 --> 16:55.067
So do I, Professor.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.667
We're almost there,
Thunderbird 2.

17:04.833 --> 17:07.300
-Stand by for lift-off.
-F-A-B.

17:10.767 --> 17:13.633
We have about 12 minutes
before we lose the
containment field.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.833
Nothing can stop
the implosion after that.

17:15.900 --> 17:19.567
Plenty of time... I hope.

17:19.633 --> 17:21.067
12 minutes, Virgil.

17:21.100 --> 17:23.100
All right. Hold on.
We're lifting off.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.467
LADY PENELOPE: F-A-B.

17:43.367 --> 17:45.567
Easy, Thunderbird 2. Easy.

17:46.867 --> 17:47.800
Argh!

17:47.867 --> 17:49.500
PARKER: Whoa!

17:51.633 --> 17:53.200
Hold on. Stabilizing.

17:53.267 --> 17:55.600
SCOTT OVER RADIO:
You're clear. Keep going.

18:00.433 --> 18:03.500
Reminds me of my
seafaring days.

18:03.567 --> 18:06.467
-You were a sailor too?
-Pirate, ma'am.

18:06.533 --> 18:09.400
Back when I was on the
wrong side of the law.

18:09.467 --> 18:12.133
I'm not proud of
my past, you know.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.267
That was a long
time ago, Parker.

18:14.333 --> 18:16.367
Your father gave me
a second chance

18:16.433 --> 18:18.467
away from a life of crime.

18:18.533 --> 18:22.933
And he trusted me to protect
his most valuable possession.

18:23.067 --> 18:24.367
You, m'lady.

18:24.433 --> 18:27.133
You've always lived up to
his trust in you, Parker.

18:27.200 --> 18:30.500
-Even now?
-Especially now.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.200
Now get cracking.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.067
(CRACKS KNUCKLES)

18:41.467 --> 18:44.067
This came off
my very first car.

18:44.067 --> 18:48.400
A '29 Boxley Comet.
What a beaut!

18:50.700 --> 18:53.700
You've rerouted the biometric
scanner to the inside!

18:53.767 --> 18:55.967
But the angle is all wrong!

18:56.067 --> 18:57.367
Hold on.

18:59.500 --> 19:02.600
-How's that?
-It's perfect!

19:02.667 --> 19:04.533
Your hand, Professor.

19:07.200 --> 19:11.633
COMPUTER: (BEEPS)
Identification verified.
Professor Alice Lungren.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.400
Scott? Can you hear me?

19:13.467 --> 19:15.067
I'm right outside,
Lady Penelope.

19:15.100 --> 19:18.667
Good. I need you to enter
some numbers into the keypad.

19:18.733 --> 19:20.767
And use the gum!

19:30.367 --> 19:31.667
What's our time, Professor?

19:31.733 --> 19:34.300
We have less than a minute
before this thing implodes.

19:34.367 --> 19:36.733
Virgil, set her down!
We have less than a minute!

19:36.800 --> 19:39.500
Hold on. We're almost
at the mineshaft.

19:56.400 --> 19:58.100
There's the ledge. Jump!

20:03.467 --> 20:04.367

(ZAPPING AND FIZZING)

20:09.267 --> 20:12.767
I've lost two magnets!
The reaction must
have polarized them!

20:14.067 --> 20:15.533
Get out of there, Scott!

-(PARKER GROANS)
-Who's a good dog?

20:54.133 --> 20:55.633
Why so gloomy, Parker?

20:55.700 --> 20:58.200
Today's rescue wouldn't have
been possible without you

20:58.267 --> 20:59.900
and your alleged talents.

21:00.067 --> 21:01.533
Sorry, m'lady.

21:01.600 --> 21:04.567
Just having a bit of trouble
letting go, that's all.

21:05.667 --> 21:08.833
That kit saw me
through thick and thin.

21:08.900 --> 21:11.633
And they really don't
make that gum anymore.

21:11.700 --> 21:13.767
Well, look on the bright side.
We ended up having to miss

21:13.833 --> 21:16.067
the Prime Minister's charity
ball this evening.

21:16.133 --> 21:18.900
Oh, I'm so disappointed.

21:18.967 --> 21:20.500
I knew you would be.

21:20.567 --> 21:24.233
The PM sent her regards,
and she sent this.

21:24.300 --> 21:28.633
-My favorite gum!
-It's the Prime
Minister's favorite too.

21:28.700 --> 21:31.300
She's got a
personal stockpile.

21:31.367 --> 21:34.400
So any time you want,
you're welcome to it.

21:34.467 --> 21:36.067
Perhaps it's not too late

21:36.067 --> 21:38.600
to put in an appearance
at her event tonight.

21:38.667 --> 21:40.167
(GROWLS AND YAPS)

21:40.233 --> 21:43.467
I'll bring the
car round, m'lady.
