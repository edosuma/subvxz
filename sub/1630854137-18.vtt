00:04.221 --> 00:06.180
<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

00:06.180 --> 00:07.485
<i>sexually based offenses</i>

00:07.485 --> 00:09.792
<i>are considered
especially heinous.</i>

00:09.792 --> 00:12.360
<i>In New York City,
the dedicated detectives</i>

00:12.360 --> 00:14.144
<i>who investigate
these vicious felonies</i>

00:14.144 --> 00:15.624
<i>are members of an elite squad</i>

00:15.624 --> 00:17.843
<i>known as
the Special Victims Unit.</i>

00:17.843 --> 00:20.411
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:21.760 --> 00:24.372
The constant,
endless criticism--

00:24.372 --> 00:26.287
I feel terrible about myself.

00:26.287 --> 00:28.158
Martin,
it's important to remember

00:28.158 --> 00:30.291
that behind each of
Connie's criticisms

00:30.291 --> 00:32.423
is an unspoken wish.

00:32.423 --> 00:35.122
Connie, maybe you can tell
Martin what those wishes are.

00:35.122 --> 00:38.038
I wish I was enough.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.214
Martin,
try to be non-reactive.

00:40.214 --> 00:44.348
I want to matter to you
as much as you matter to me.

00:44.348 --> 00:46.002
My whole life
revolves around you.

00:47.264 --> 00:49.092
It always has.
- Why do you push me away?

00:49.092 --> 00:51.529
I need more space.

00:51.529 --> 00:52.704
That's all.

00:52.704 --> 00:53.923
Say it to Connie.

00:53.923 --> 00:58.841
I need freedom,
volition, agency.

00:58.841 --> 01:00.712
For what?

01:00.712 --> 01:03.193
To be happy.

01:03.193 --> 01:05.108
Your happiness has
always come first.

01:05.108 --> 01:08.285
Then why do I feel like an
eel flipping around the deck

01:08.285 --> 01:10.548
of a boat, gasping for breath?

01:10.548 --> 01:13.725
Well, that's hyperbolic,
isn't it?

01:13.725 --> 01:17.990
All I ask is for one night
a week, just us.

01:17.990 --> 01:19.166
But it's never
one night, is it?

01:19.166 --> 01:21.168
It's canasta before bed

01:21.168 --> 01:23.866
followed by Fox News
under a cotton duvet.

01:23.866 --> 01:27.043
She gets mad if we don't
commute to work together.

01:27.043 --> 01:31.961
My life is an unending Mobius
strip of violent closeness.

01:31.961 --> 01:33.658
Are you going to let him
talk to me like that?

01:33.658 --> 01:37.097
You control everything,
even these sessions.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.489
It's called support.

01:38.489 --> 01:41.579
I am asphyxiated
by your support.

01:41.579 --> 01:44.278
While gorging yourself
on my money.

01:44.278 --> 01:48.282
As an exercise, I'd like
you both to switch roles.

01:48.282 --> 01:51.502
Try to see what it feels
like to be the other one.

01:51.502 --> 01:54.114
both: No.

01:57.334 --> 01:59.554
This view never gets old.

01:59.554 --> 02:01.947
Oh, I can see
the headline now.

02:01.947 --> 02:06.256
Connie Parish shatters
the glass ceiling.

02:06.256 --> 02:08.040
I didn't shatter anything.

02:08.040 --> 02:10.173
Simply built
the higher ceiling.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.914
Yeah, the first
female developer to build

02:11.914 --> 02:14.917
a hundred floors of luxury
in Manhattan.

02:14.917 --> 02:18.225
You realize what
a goddamn icon she is, right?

02:18.225 --> 02:20.575
She reminds me of it
every day.

02:22.490 --> 02:25.971
Martin...

02:25.971 --> 02:28.452
I have matcha mouth.

02:30.324 --> 02:32.239
Thank you.
Eugene?

02:32.239 --> 02:34.763
All right, so we are on
completion schedule,

02:34.763 --> 02:37.200
code compliant
fire inspection signed.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.288
And sales?

02:38.288 --> 02:40.290
80% of units closed.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.031
Check out the net total.

02:42.031 --> 02:44.207
Oh, we're making history
and money.

02:44.207 --> 02:45.687
Care to christen a--

02:45.687 --> 02:47.384
a room?

02:47.384 --> 02:49.212
Which one's your favorite?

02:49.212 --> 02:50.648
I'm fond of the
upstairs terrace.

02:50.648 --> 02:51.562
Me, too.

02:51.562 --> 02:53.085
Eugene and I will be a moment.

02:54.783 --> 02:55.914
You're not the only one

02:55.914 --> 02:58.613
who needs a little bit
of freedom here.

03:03.835 --> 03:05.837
Are you OK, Martin?

03:05.837 --> 03:07.317
They're not exactly
being subtle.

03:07.317 --> 03:08.927
It's OK to be pissed.

03:08.927 --> 03:10.755
If I get angry, she wins.

03:10.755 --> 03:13.236
Wins what?

03:13.236 --> 03:15.456
Battle of who can care less.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.153
Self-medicating helps.

03:17.153 --> 03:18.981
So would a lobotomy.

03:18.981 --> 03:21.026
I can help with the former.

03:21.026 --> 03:24.813
You want to come over for
a glass or two of wine?

03:24.813 --> 03:26.423
I like hanging out.

03:26.423 --> 03:28.904
I really do, but--

03:28.904 --> 03:31.559
You don't feel worthy?

03:31.559 --> 03:33.125
I like your guidance.

03:33.125 --> 03:36.085
I'm scheduling next week's
stagings for the D line units

03:36.085 --> 03:37.347
in the 20 building.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.523
Let me just run
some looks by you.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.226
We'll keep it PG.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.184
I can be free in an hour.

03:54.973 --> 03:58.847
Martin, I'm going to
run home and freshen up

03:58.847 --> 04:01.850
before our dinner.

04:01.850 --> 04:04.418
I can't meet you,
not tonight.

04:04.418 --> 04:07.638
Well, it's Friday night.

04:07.638 --> 04:10.075
I made plans.

04:10.075 --> 04:12.295
Plans?
Martin.

04:12.295 --> 04:14.254
With whom?

04:14.254 --> 04:17.082
None of your business.

04:17.082 --> 04:18.910
Well, I'm making dinner,

04:18.910 --> 04:21.609
followed by cards
and a bottle of wine.

04:28.485 --> 04:32.533
You don't cancel on me.

04:36.972 --> 04:39.844
I just did.

04:47.330 --> 04:51.029
I like the color palette
and the styling.

04:51.029 --> 04:54.424
Question is, will Connie like
it for the North River Suites?

04:54.424 --> 04:57.688
Mm, predicting the whims
of an overt narcissist--

04:57.688 --> 04:59.777
is that really how you
want to launch your career?

04:59.777 --> 05:03.303
Her checks cash, don't they?

05:03.303 --> 05:06.697
I'm tired.
Do you have any coke?

05:06.697 --> 05:11.702
Did you already finish
the stuff I brought last time?

05:14.488 --> 05:16.490
Here you go.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.333
You can keep the rest.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.030
It's nice of you
to invite me over.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.988
Honestly,
it was just an excuse

05:36.988 --> 05:38.381
to get you away from her.

05:38.381 --> 05:41.689
I like that you
want to protect me.

05:43.473 --> 05:46.346
Makes me feel safe.

05:49.305 --> 05:51.351
We both know
this isn't smart.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.700
You didn't seem
to have a problem

05:52.700 --> 05:55.616
the last dozen or so times.

05:55.616 --> 05:58.183
A private eye came to see me.

06:01.752 --> 06:03.580
One of Connie's
flying monkeys.

06:03.580 --> 06:05.756
What did you tell him?

06:05.756 --> 06:07.845
Nothing.
Chill.

06:07.845 --> 06:10.718
But he did ask how often
you come over here.

06:10.718 --> 06:13.634
And now you don't
want to do this?

06:13.634 --> 06:15.026
Maybe it's for the best.

06:15.026 --> 06:18.856
I mean, focusing on me
like this, I can't say no.

06:18.856 --> 06:21.076
Because of my
relationship to Connie?

06:21.076 --> 06:24.035
Because you're my boss, technically,

06:24.035 --> 06:28.518
and it makes me unable to know
whether I'm good at my job.

06:28.518 --> 06:30.781
Martin, are you listening?

06:30.781 --> 06:33.262
- Are you?
- No, Martin.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.831
- You don't say no to me!
- Martin.

06:36.831 --> 06:39.181
Stop, stop, stop!

06:39.181 --> 06:42.663

07:39.589 --> 07:41.635
I hurt someone.

07:44.333 --> 07:47.467
I took out all my anger. I--

07:47.467 --> 07:50.078
Shh.

07:50.078 --> 07:53.473
Mama's here.
Mama's here. Mama's here.

07:53.473 --> 07:57.781
I won't let anything
happen to you.

07:57.781 --> 08:00.088
Shh.

08:54.185 --> 08:56.579
You know we have
coffee here, right?

08:56.579 --> 08:58.668
I just like things
a certain way.

08:58.668 --> 09:00.104
Yeah, starting to see that.

09:00.104 --> 09:03.194
You want a donut?

09:03.194 --> 09:05.936
Late night?

09:05.936 --> 09:07.285
Brushing up for my Masters

09:07.285 --> 09:09.070
of Public Administration
and Leadership.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.854
The MPAL.

09:10.854 --> 09:12.595
You really are going to
run the city someday, huh?

09:12.595 --> 09:14.771
For now, I just settle on
running things by Benson.

09:16.425 --> 09:17.600
How's your brother Teddy
doing?

09:17.600 --> 09:19.994
I kind of think
he's seeing someone.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.604
Oh, you think?
You don't know?

09:21.604 --> 09:24.607
Well, he knows what a bitch
I am to the women he dates,

09:24.607 --> 09:26.000
but the guy deserves it
'cause he's got

09:26.000 --> 09:28.089
the worst taste in women.

09:29.394 --> 09:31.875
It's nice to see Muncy
and Churlish talking.

09:31.875 --> 09:34.269
Don't get excited.
They're the only ones here.

09:34.269 --> 09:37.272
Velasco's off,
and Bruno just comes and goes.

09:37.272 --> 09:39.013
Ah, is he still
auditioning us?

09:39.013 --> 09:41.102
Must be nice not
to need a paycheck.

09:41.102 --> 09:43.495
We're lucky to have him
when we have him.

09:43.495 --> 09:46.194
He's a good cop.

09:46.194 --> 09:48.152
That kind of optimism
should be a crime.

09:48.152 --> 09:51.112
Ah, so arrest me.

09:51.112 --> 09:54.681
Benson.

09:54.681 --> 09:58.249
Uh-huh, and she's getting
a kit done now?

10:00.556 --> 10:02.950
I'll send somebody over
to take her statement.

10:02.950 --> 10:04.908
Yeah.

10:04.908 --> 10:07.128
Well, that was Mercy Hospital.

10:07.128 --> 10:08.651
Mona Stewart, 22,

10:08.651 --> 10:11.785
raped last night
by somebody she works with.

10:11.785 --> 10:13.090
Who's the guy?

10:13.090 --> 10:16.180
Martin Parish
of Parish Enterprises.

10:16.180 --> 10:17.921
The builder's son?

10:17.921 --> 10:19.401
He's got money.
We know that.

10:19.401 --> 10:21.490
That explains how
you got a direct call.

10:21.490 --> 10:24.798
So who do I take,
Muncy or Churlish?

10:24.798 --> 10:28.628
How about we let them
go alone together?

10:28.628 --> 10:32.283
Could be a good
bonding exercise.

10:36.418 --> 10:38.289
I should have called 911
last night,

10:38.289 --> 10:41.249
but Martin brought coke.

10:41.249 --> 10:43.512
I did some. I didn't want
to get in trouble.

10:43.512 --> 10:46.515
You won't.
That's not why we're here.

10:46.515 --> 10:49.039
Can you tell us
what happened?

10:49.039 --> 10:54.610
He has these weird compulsory
dinners with his mother.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.438
He usually likes
coming to my place after

10:56.438 --> 10:58.614
as some sort of refuge.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.398
Was it a date?

11:00.398 --> 11:01.704
We're colleagues.

11:01.704 --> 11:04.838
I do interior design
for the company.

11:04.838 --> 11:10.713
I mean, we snuggle,
sometimes watch a movie.

11:10.713 --> 11:13.411
He's rich, but he doesn't
have many friends.

11:13.411 --> 11:15.152
Then what happened?

11:15.152 --> 11:18.939
We had some wine,
did some coke.

11:20.375 --> 11:23.030
We were just hanging out.

11:23.030 --> 11:25.815
Then he made a move.

11:25.815 --> 11:27.599
And how did you respond?

11:27.599 --> 11:30.254
- I tried to push him away.
- And what did he do?

11:30.254 --> 11:33.693
He got angry,

11:33.693 --> 11:36.739
ripped my shirt,

11:36.739 --> 11:40.961
bit my breasts hard,

11:40.961 --> 11:43.267
then raped me.

11:43.267 --> 11:46.183
I just laid there frozen.

11:46.183 --> 11:48.882
It's called fawning.

11:48.882 --> 11:51.362
It's OK. It's normal.

11:53.625 --> 11:56.977
Did he say anything
to you after?

11:56.977 --> 11:59.457
He left.

11:59.457 --> 12:02.069
I left a voicemail
for my roommate.

12:02.069 --> 12:05.768
He came home and saw
the bite marks, freaked out.

12:05.768 --> 12:07.683
That's when I called 911.

12:11.818 --> 12:15.082
I was just going
to forget about it,

12:15.082 --> 12:17.519
but I'm no one's fawn.

12:17.519 --> 12:18.825
I don't care if I lose my job.

12:18.825 --> 12:21.697
I want this bastard
charged with rape.

12:30.227 --> 12:31.751
So we're looking at
Martin Parish,

12:31.751 --> 12:34.188
the only son
of Connie and Peter Parish.

12:34.188 --> 12:36.190
Peter Parish sold his side
of the business,

12:36.190 --> 12:37.800
ran off with the nanny
years ago,

12:37.800 --> 12:39.323
so Connie has been suing him
for one thing or another

12:39.323 --> 12:40.629
ever since.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.326
We know this family
has lawyers on retainer.

12:42.326 --> 12:43.675
What do we know
about Mona Stewart?

12:43.675 --> 12:45.155
- Mona's credible.
- And resourceful.

12:45.155 --> 12:47.549
She gave me and Muncy the
wine glass Martin drank from.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.246
The lab pulled DNA
from her rape kit.

12:49.246 --> 12:50.813
Great.
We have an outcry witness?

12:50.813 --> 12:53.207
Yeah. She called a roommate,
Stanton Garber that night,

12:53.207 --> 12:54.643
left a message,
and then told him

12:54.643 --> 12:56.340
the whole story this morning.
- Enough to arrest?

12:56.340 --> 12:57.472
Yeah, it is,
but if you do that,

12:57.472 --> 12:58.690
Martin's just going
to lawyer up.

12:58.690 --> 13:01.868
So let's get his side first.

13:05.349 --> 13:07.308
Mona went to the police?

13:07.308 --> 13:08.570
That's crazy.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.224
When I left, she was fine.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.921
So you were at her apartment.

13:11.921 --> 13:14.358
She was going over
her designs for the D line

13:14.358 --> 13:15.751
at North River Suites.

13:15.751 --> 13:18.188
- Nothing romantic?
- Why? What is she saying?

13:18.188 --> 13:20.625
Look, we're not HR,
Mr. Parish,

13:20.625 --> 13:23.803
so if you two had sex, that's--
that's your business.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.240
We, uh, cuddled.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.676
Nothing more than that?

13:27.676 --> 13:30.461
Before you answer that,
you should know that

13:30.461 --> 13:34.204
Mercy Hospital photographed
quite a few bite marks,

13:34.204 --> 13:37.642
so we did a rape kit.

13:37.642 --> 13:40.167
We were high on cocaine.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.821
It's an aggressive drug.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.648
It's not the first time we've
left bite marks on each other.

13:43.648 --> 13:46.738
It's not the first time, OK,

13:46.738 --> 13:50.307
but last night,
she called the police.

13:50.307 --> 13:51.743
Any idea why?

13:51.743 --> 13:55.138
My mother was
about to fire her.

13:55.138 --> 13:56.400
She might have gotten wind.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.228
This is all starting
to make sense right now.

13:58.228 --> 13:59.708
She was blackmailing you?

13:59.708 --> 14:01.884
I never should
have gone over there.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.451
I knew it was a risk given
her tenuous employment--

14:03.451 --> 14:05.975
Martin, that's enough.

14:05.975 --> 14:08.891
I'm Captain Benson.
This is Sergeant Tutuola.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.588
I take it
you're Martin's mother.

14:10.588 --> 14:13.896
I am.
So what's this all about?

14:13.896 --> 14:16.072
We got a complaint from
one of your employees,

14:16.072 --> 14:17.421
Mona Stewart.

14:17.421 --> 14:19.075
Well, that wouldn't be
the first time

14:19.075 --> 14:22.905
a soon-to-be ex-employee
tried to shake us down.

14:22.905 --> 14:25.081
We found her story
quite credible.

14:25.081 --> 14:27.388
- She let me snuggle with her--
- Shut up, Martin.

14:27.388 --> 14:30.521
I appreciate
you're doing your jobs,

14:30.521 --> 14:33.089
but my son won't be
answering any more questions

14:33.089 --> 14:34.612
without counsel.

14:34.612 --> 14:37.702
I apologize,
but you understand.

14:37.702 --> 14:41.141
We understand very well.

14:41.141 --> 14:43.491
We'll be in touch.

14:46.581 --> 14:49.453
- Mommy was pissed.
- Well, that's not anger, Fin.

14:49.453 --> 14:53.066
That's jealousy.

14:53.066 --> 14:55.459
So the Parishes lawyered up.
No surprise there.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.461
Our witness is cooperating?
- So far.

14:57.461 --> 15:00.029
We have Martin's DNA
on the rape kit,

15:00.029 --> 15:01.639
her outcry to her roommate.

15:01.639 --> 15:02.945
OK, what are you
not telling me?

15:02.945 --> 15:04.468
She admits to
prior encounters.

15:04.468 --> 15:06.166
Her kit shows
alcohol and cocaine.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.819
Which normally
wouldn't matter,

15:07.819 --> 15:09.952
but Connie Parish is trying
to get in front of this,

15:09.952 --> 15:11.519
claiming they were
about to fire Mona.

15:11.519 --> 15:13.477
Sorry to interrupt.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.610
Mona.
This is ADA Carisi.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.655
How you doing? We're just
going over your case.

15:17.655 --> 15:19.483
Well, you can stop.
I changed my mind.

15:19.483 --> 15:21.268
This wasn't really rape.
- Hang on, Mona.

15:21.268 --> 15:22.617
Let's think about this.
- No.

15:22.617 --> 15:24.836
I'm just here because
you won't stop calling.

15:24.836 --> 15:26.969
I'm sorry.

15:26.969 --> 15:28.971
Looks like Mommy
protected her baby boy

15:28.971 --> 15:30.320
with a lot of zeroes.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.495
Carisi, please tell me
that we can

15:31.495 --> 15:32.670
make this case without her.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.107
Maybe I can get
an indictment,

15:34.107 --> 15:35.717
but convincing a jury's
something else.

15:35.717 --> 15:36.718
So he's just going
to get away with it?

15:36.718 --> 15:39.112
We have the rape kit.

15:39.112 --> 15:41.723
We have her outcry witness.
That's probable cause.

15:41.723 --> 15:45.161
It's enough to arrest him,
if that'll make you feel better.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.337
Oh, it will.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.604
- Martin is sleeping.
- That's OK.

15:53.604 --> 15:56.216
We'll wake him up.
We're here to arrest him.

15:56.216 --> 15:57.739
It's good.
We got it.

16:00.872 --> 16:03.963
Oh, the TV's still on.
He might be awake.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.921
NYP--

16:09.316 --> 16:10.752
What the hell is this?

16:10.752 --> 16:12.580
We could ask you
the same thing.

16:12.580 --> 16:15.017
We're here to arrest your son,
Mrs. Parish.

16:15.017 --> 16:16.366
Stand up,
hands behind your back.

16:16.366 --> 16:17.889
Don't you touch him.

16:17.889 --> 16:20.588
Do not move,
or we will arrest you, too.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.546
Martin.

16:22.546 --> 16:26.028
OK. I'm calling my lawyer now.

16:26.028 --> 16:29.597
That's a good idea because
you're going to need one.

16:36.734 --> 16:38.649
Dude had his head
on Mommy's boobs?

16:38.649 --> 16:39.999
Sure what it looked like.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.435
Could explain his issues.

16:41.435 --> 16:43.654
What, are you working
for the defense now?

16:43.654 --> 16:45.917
Excuse me, Captain Benson.

16:45.917 --> 16:48.007
Can I help you?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.573
Ron Cohen.
I have a few questions.

16:49.573 --> 16:51.619
You can call
the NYPD press office.

16:51.619 --> 16:54.100
But this is about
Mona Stewart,

16:54.100 --> 16:56.058
the young woman who's
stalking Martin Parish,

16:56.058 --> 16:58.626
making false accusations.
- And who hired you?

16:58.626 --> 17:00.019
Connie Parish?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.890
Do you know about
Ms. Stewart's personal life,

17:01.890 --> 17:03.935
work performance?
- Get the hell out of here, man.

17:03.935 --> 17:05.633
Hey, this is an
extortion plot.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.809
Tell your employer,
if she has questions,

17:07.809 --> 17:09.550
she knows where I work.

17:13.249 --> 17:15.164
The court accepts
the defendant's plea

17:15.164 --> 17:16.165
of not guilty.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.210
People on bail?

17:17.210 --> 17:18.515
$1 million, Your Honor.

17:18.515 --> 17:20.343
Mr. Parish has unlimited means,

17:20.343 --> 17:22.302
including access
to private jets.

17:22.302 --> 17:23.825
We consider him
to be a flight risk.

17:23.825 --> 17:26.132
My client is willing to
surrender his passport.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.959
- Your Honor--
- I'm granting ROR.

17:27.959 --> 17:30.049
Keep your powder dry,
Mr. Carisi.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.442
Bailiff, next case.

17:40.885 --> 17:42.452
I'll take what I have
to the grand jury,

17:42.452 --> 17:44.019
but I can't guarantee
an indictment.

17:44.019 --> 17:45.325
Pessimist.

17:45.325 --> 17:46.543
Look, I have faith
in you, Carisi.

17:46.543 --> 17:47.718
I appreciate that,
but I'd rather have

17:47.718 --> 17:49.503
Mona's cooperation--
at the very least,

17:49.503 --> 17:51.983
that testimony from the outcry
witness, Stanton Garber.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.724
We're working on that.
What else?

17:53.724 --> 17:56.205
Just make sure that Martin
doesn't get on a private jet,

17:56.205 --> 17:59.339
fly to Moscow, and move in
with Edward Snowden.

17:59.339 --> 18:01.819
Was Carisi this cranky
when he was a detective?

18:01.819 --> 18:02.907
Yes.

18:02.907 --> 18:04.387
Where are we with
Mona's roommate?

18:04.387 --> 18:06.172
I couldn't get a hold of him.

18:06.172 --> 18:08.261
He moved out of Mona's
rent-stabilized place

18:08.261 --> 18:09.653
a few days after the rape.

18:09.653 --> 18:11.394
All right,
so he took a payoff, too.

18:11.394 --> 18:15.616
I put Muncy and Churlish
on the case.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.748
Well, she looks fired up.
You need me?

18:17.748 --> 18:21.752
No.
You secure the outcry witness.

18:21.752 --> 18:25.365
I can handle the mother.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.584
Captain Benson, a word?

18:27.584 --> 18:30.021
Just us?

18:30.021 --> 18:32.415
Where's your, uh, pit bull PI?

18:34.591 --> 18:37.420
Well, as a mother,
I'm sure you'll appreciate

18:37.420 --> 18:41.685
how helpless you feel when
you see your child in trouble.

18:41.685 --> 18:43.905
Your son shouldn't
have committed rape.

18:43.905 --> 18:45.907
Sure about that?

18:45.907 --> 18:47.909
I heard she changed her story.

18:47.909 --> 18:49.302
Because you paid her.

18:49.302 --> 18:52.740
I'm doing everything I can
to protect my son--

18:52.740 --> 18:56.178
like you'd do, what--
what you have done.

18:56.178 --> 18:59.094
That gang case?

18:59.094 --> 19:00.530
So you follow the news.

19:00.530 --> 19:04.882
I admire you,
raising your son alone,

19:04.882 --> 19:07.276
climbing the career ladder,

19:07.276 --> 19:09.278
being mother and father
at the same time.

19:09.278 --> 19:11.672
Well, I guess we have that
in common, don't we?

19:11.672 --> 19:15.328
You know,
when my husband ran off,

19:15.328 --> 19:16.807
Martin was all I had.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.548
So there was nothing
that you wouldn't do

19:18.548 --> 19:24.206
to protect your son,
including bribing rape victims.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.861
Well, sounds like
you have an axe to grind

19:26.861 --> 19:28.819
with people who have money.

19:28.819 --> 19:31.779
With people who abuse
their privilege?

19:31.779 --> 19:33.084
Yes.

19:33.084 --> 19:36.000
You've had
a rough few months.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.873
The DOJ called in
to clean up SVU--

19:38.873 --> 19:41.180
that must have been
really embarrassing.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.746
Yeah, that wasn't my squad.

19:42.746 --> 19:45.923
Maybe not, but you are
at the end of your career.

19:45.923 --> 19:47.795
You can't afford to look like
you're slipping.

19:47.795 --> 19:53.148
You're sacrificing my son to
keep your reputation intact.

19:53.148 --> 19:55.455
So your son is a rapist,

19:55.455 --> 20:00.155
and no matter how much
you're willing to spend,

20:00.155 --> 20:01.939
that will never change.

20:01.939 --> 20:07.554
I'll do what I have to,
just like you did.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.512
Do you honestly think
you're the only mother

20:09.512 --> 20:13.429
who would do everything in her
power to keep her child safe?

20:13.429 --> 20:15.953
I didn't break the law.

20:15.953 --> 20:19.305
But we both know
you would have,

20:19.305 --> 20:22.482
so please, let's not
disrespect each other

20:22.482 --> 20:25.659
by pretending otherwise.

20:28.183 --> 20:29.750
Captain.

20:34.668 --> 20:36.539
Yeah, we're waiting, Sarge.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.541
We won't leave until he shows.

20:38.541 --> 20:39.890
Copy.

20:39.890 --> 20:41.588
And far as I can tell,
Martin's never had

20:41.588 --> 20:43.764
a serious girlfriend.
- Yeah, 'cause he's got his mom.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.896
There he is,
Mona's ex-roommate.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.246
Somebody going shopping.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.551
I can't even pronounce
half these brand names.

20:48.551 --> 20:51.511
Don't look at me.
Stanton Garber?

20:51.511 --> 20:53.077
I told you guys
I don't know anything

20:53.077 --> 20:54.514
about what happened to Mona.

20:54.514 --> 20:56.080
And we're telling you
you're lying.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.343
Mona told me she was lying.

20:57.343 --> 20:58.909
She changed her mind

20:58.909 --> 21:01.085
after she got a payout
from the Parishes.

21:01.085 --> 21:02.696
I'm guessing you did, too.

21:02.696 --> 21:05.220
One-bedroom condos in this
building start at a million.

21:05.220 --> 21:06.569
And that's the real crime.

21:06.569 --> 21:08.092
We pull your phone records,
we can prove

21:08.092 --> 21:09.355
that Mona called you that night.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.052
We can also get a search
warrant for your phone

21:11.052 --> 21:12.532
to retrieve her message.

21:12.532 --> 21:14.185
I don't like being harassed.

21:14.185 --> 21:15.448
How about arrested?

21:15.448 --> 21:17.319
Interfering with
a police investigation.

21:17.319 --> 21:18.755
- Obstruction.
- Perjury.

21:18.755 --> 21:20.540
And fair warning,
even the cheap lawyers

21:20.540 --> 21:21.976
will go through
that payout faster

21:21.976 --> 21:24.413
than you can file bankruptcy.

21:27.895 --> 21:29.940
Stanton, call me back.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.246
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

21:31.246 --> 21:33.117
<i>Martin just attacked me.</i>

21:33.117 --> 21:35.163
<i>He bit me.
He raped me.</i>

21:35.163 --> 21:37.165
<i>Can you please come home?</i>

21:37.165 --> 21:39.559
That is a message that
Mona left for her roommate

21:39.559 --> 21:41.561
the night of the assault.
- Uncorroborated.

21:41.561 --> 21:43.432
That's inadmissible.

21:43.432 --> 21:45.956
Well, her roommate will
testify at the grand jury

21:45.956 --> 21:47.436
and at trial.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.351
We'll get a hearsay exception
for the message.

21:49.351 --> 21:51.048
It's an excited utterance.

21:51.048 --> 21:53.312
Mona made this whole thing up
to blackmail me.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.226
We already know
she's not testifying.

21:55.226 --> 21:56.750
I can compel her.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.708
She'll be a hostile witness,
but the jury

21:58.708 --> 22:03.409
will hear her voice testifying
that that message is from her.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.759
You don't want
to go to trial.

22:05.759 --> 22:07.413
Maybe you're right
about that,

22:07.413 --> 22:09.545
so let's start clean.

22:09.545 --> 22:11.286
I'm not pleading guilty
to anything.

22:11.286 --> 22:13.636
Martin, take a timeout.

22:13.636 --> 22:17.248
My mother says that the only
reason you're coming after me

22:17.248 --> 22:18.902
is because of our family name.

22:18.902 --> 22:20.817
Hey, Martin,

22:20.817 --> 22:24.908
we're going after you
because you're a rapist,

22:24.908 --> 22:29.086
and for the first time
in your life,

22:29.086 --> 22:31.306
your mother can't help you.

22:35.658 --> 22:37.051
How is this possible?

22:37.051 --> 22:39.401
I could go to jail
if I don't testify?

22:39.401 --> 22:40.794
If you don't comply
with the subpoena.

22:40.794 --> 22:42.752
But believe me,
our captain doesn't like

22:42.752 --> 22:44.450
threatening victims
with contempt.

22:44.450 --> 22:48.367
So I have an idea. Don't.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.325
You were raped, Mona.

22:50.325 --> 22:51.544
That kind of trauma
doesn't go away

22:51.544 --> 22:54.547
by moving into
a bigger apartment.

22:54.547 --> 22:56.462
Tell your story on the stand.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.812
Take ownership
of what happened to you.

22:58.812 --> 23:01.205
So this is you guys
worried about me?

23:01.205 --> 23:03.207
I'm doing just fine.

23:03.207 --> 23:06.820
And when the money runs out?

23:06.820 --> 23:09.257
You had a job
you were proud of.

23:09.257 --> 23:10.954
You have a lot to live for.

23:10.954 --> 23:14.610
Don't let what this guy did to
you make you lose self-respect.

23:14.610 --> 23:16.395
It's not worth it.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.658
Connie Parish is never
going to let

23:18.658 --> 23:21.661
her "widdle baby boy"
go to prison.

23:21.661 --> 23:26.579
You guys are deluded
if you think you could win.

23:26.579 --> 23:28.145
<i>So if Mona doesn't
want to pursue</i>

23:28.145 --> 23:31.235
and she's incentivized
to turn the other way,

23:31.235 --> 23:32.976
this feels like a non-starter.

23:32.976 --> 23:34.543
We're police officers.

23:34.543 --> 23:36.719
Yeah, I'm just trying
to see both sides.

23:36.719 --> 23:38.982
Like you did with Velasco?

23:38.982 --> 23:42.769
Churlish,
life isn't pass-fail.

23:42.769 --> 23:45.075
We just got a call
from Mona's building.

23:45.075 --> 23:48.383
Her new super found her body.
She's dead.

23:56.696 --> 23:59.002
I was trying to let some
delivery guys in,

23:59.002 --> 24:01.004
used my key,
found her lying on the floor.

24:01.004 --> 24:02.310
What are we looking at?

24:02.310 --> 24:03.746
We did CPR,
took a shot at Narcan,

24:03.746 --> 24:05.356
but she was already gone.

24:05.356 --> 24:06.662
OD?

24:06.662 --> 24:09.535
Whole world is laced
with fentanyl these days.

24:14.148 --> 24:16.411
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

24:16.411 --> 24:18.152
The night before
the grand jury,

24:18.152 --> 24:20.720
and Mona just happens
to overdose?

24:20.720 --> 24:23.505
We'll get an autopsy
and a forensic analysis

24:23.505 --> 24:24.941
on the drugs.

24:24.941 --> 24:28.118
And bring Martin in
for questioning.

24:28.118 --> 24:29.685
We found cocaine
in her system

24:29.685 --> 24:30.904
but not enough for an overdose.

24:30.904 --> 24:32.471
Any fentanyl in it?

24:32.471 --> 24:34.951
Trace amounts,
not nearly enough to kill her.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.431
So what did?

24:36.431 --> 24:38.302
X-rays we took show
some type of

24:38.302 --> 24:40.696
prolonged microscopic scarring.

24:40.696 --> 24:42.132
That's not from the cocaine.

24:42.132 --> 24:44.395
If I didn't know whose lungs
I was looking at,

24:44.395 --> 24:46.354
I'd say she was at
ground zero during 9/11.

24:46.354 --> 24:48.051
Well, she's too young
for that.

24:48.051 --> 24:50.445
She suffered a fatal
pulmonary insult.

24:50.445 --> 24:53.404
Couldn't get oxygen
into her bloodstream.

24:53.404 --> 24:56.886
So she suffocated
from the inside out?

24:56.886 --> 24:59.062
- How?
- Nothing on the tox screen.

24:59.062 --> 25:01.543
I can dissect the lung
and order some tests.

25:01.543 --> 25:03.371
For now, if I had to guess
cause of death,

25:03.371 --> 25:05.852
it's looking like asphyxia.

25:05.852 --> 25:09.072
We just don't know from what.

25:09.072 --> 25:10.552
So what do we know?

25:10.552 --> 25:12.075
Well, Mona was about
to go to the grand jury,

25:12.075 --> 25:13.381
and now she's been
silenced for good.

25:13.381 --> 25:14.948
Maybe Connie's
getting desperate.

25:14.948 --> 25:17.211
Maybe she poisoned
Mona somehow.

25:17.211 --> 25:18.821
Well, according to
the medical examiner,

25:18.821 --> 25:20.693
whatever killed her
sure took the scenic route.

25:20.693 --> 25:23.391
Unless the whole point
of this was torture.

25:23.391 --> 25:24.784
Well, who would
want to torture Mona?

25:24.784 --> 25:26.437
Connie was jealous of Mona.

25:26.437 --> 25:29.440
I mean, she treats her son like
he's some kind of boyfriend.

25:29.440 --> 25:30.920
It wouldn't be the
first time somebody

25:30.920 --> 25:32.052
got poisoned for cheating.

25:32.052 --> 25:33.444
All right,
Churlish, Muncy,

25:33.444 --> 25:34.794
where did Mona say
she got the coke?

25:34.794 --> 25:36.099
She said Martin
brought it over.

25:36.099 --> 25:37.448
If it was laced
with something,

25:37.448 --> 25:38.928
maybe he's getting
infected, too.

25:38.928 --> 25:41.801
Let's see if we
can talk to him.

25:43.759 --> 25:44.978
What is this?

25:44.978 --> 25:46.283
This is a scan
of Mona's lungs.

25:46.283 --> 25:47.458
What the hell
does this prove?

25:47.458 --> 25:48.677
Nothing.

25:48.677 --> 25:50.244
It proves she was murdered
last night.

25:50.244 --> 25:52.594
- Well, that's good news.
- Is it?

25:52.594 --> 25:54.988
We'll be filing a motion
to dismiss the rape charges.

25:54.988 --> 25:56.293
Who would do such a thing?

25:56.293 --> 25:57.947
We were hoping
you could tell us.

25:57.947 --> 25:59.688
You two did cocaine together?

25:59.688 --> 26:01.211
Yeah, but not last night.

26:01.211 --> 26:04.301
Evidently, whatever killed
her is pretty slow acting.

26:04.301 --> 26:05.607
When did you two
start hanging out

26:05.607 --> 26:06.826
and doing coke together?

26:06.826 --> 26:08.175
Right after she
started the job.

26:08.175 --> 26:09.611
Six months ago?

26:09.611 --> 26:11.918
About that, but she did
way more than I did.

26:11.918 --> 26:13.267
Martin, any chance
your mother knew

26:13.267 --> 26:16.313
you and Mona were
snuggle buddies?

26:16.313 --> 26:20.100
Oh, God.
Mona did mention a private eye.

26:21.492 --> 26:23.625
How long have you been
using that inhaler?

26:23.625 --> 26:25.018
A few months.

26:25.018 --> 26:26.672
You might want to get
an X-ray of your lungs.

26:26.672 --> 26:28.151
What the hell is going on?

26:28.151 --> 26:29.370
Well, in case you
haven't noticed,

26:29.370 --> 26:31.198
we're trying to keep
your client alive.

26:31.198 --> 26:34.070
OK, OK, uh, can you
drive me to a hospital?

26:34.070 --> 26:38.161
First, we're going to need
the name of your coke dealer.

26:38.161 --> 26:40.686
This is a scan
of Martin's lungs.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.035
That looks familiar.

26:42.035 --> 26:43.863
Same type of scars
as Mona's lungs.

26:43.863 --> 26:45.342
Yeah, it's not a coincidence.

26:45.342 --> 26:46.996
Did Martin say where
he got the cocaine from?

26:46.996 --> 26:48.607
Well, here's where
it gets stranger.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.784
He says he got it from his
mother's middle-aged guy Friday,

26:51.784 --> 26:54.047
who lives out near her property
in Long Island.

26:54.047 --> 26:55.657
- Henry Caputo.
- Caputo?

26:55.657 --> 26:58.268
This guy got a record,
mob connections?

26:58.268 --> 27:00.140
Well, it's not as
stereotypical as it sounds

27:00.140 --> 27:01.445
coming from you, Carisi.

27:01.445 --> 27:03.143
Let's just say
a little of both.

27:03.143 --> 27:04.797
Well, it turns out that
the world of construction

27:04.797 --> 27:07.669
in New York
is as shady as we all thought.

27:07.669 --> 27:10.193
I get why Connie might
want to slowly poison Mona,

27:10.193 --> 27:13.414
but her own son?

27:13.414 --> 27:15.503
Maybe she wants
to keep him helpless.

27:15.503 --> 27:17.766
I mean,
Munchausen by proxy is a thing.

27:17.766 --> 27:19.942
The guy takes care
of the one property

27:19.942 --> 27:21.552
she owns in Long Island,

27:21.552 --> 27:23.380
makes about half a mil a year
doing that.

27:23.380 --> 27:26.296
Half a million dollars?
That sounds like payola to me.

27:26.296 --> 27:29.560
So can we get a warrant
for the property?

27:32.259 --> 27:34.783
Hey, you can't
just come in here.

27:34.783 --> 27:37.090
Actually, we can.
We have a warrant.

27:37.090 --> 27:39.266
I got to call Mrs. Parish.

27:39.266 --> 27:41.094
Please do.

27:51.582 --> 27:53.410
She's very particular
about this place.

27:53.410 --> 27:54.803
Yeah, I can see that.

27:54.803 --> 27:56.805
This is the first
model home her father built

27:56.805 --> 27:57.980
when she was a kid.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.373
This is like a shrine
to her father?

27:59.373 --> 28:01.723
She comes here sometimes
to be close to him.

28:01.723 --> 28:03.420
What we want to know is
where you got the cocaine

28:03.420 --> 28:04.813
you gave to Martin and Mona.

28:04.813 --> 28:07.816
I don't know what
you're talking about.

28:07.816 --> 28:09.644
Detectives, found something.

28:12.429 --> 28:14.649
Dog alerted us to the
cocaine stash in the freezer.

28:14.649 --> 28:15.737
Any poison?

28:15.737 --> 28:18.218
A bucket of
industrial abrasive.

28:18.218 --> 28:19.872
Looks an awful lot
like cocaine to me.

28:19.872 --> 28:22.701
Industrial abrasive--
that'll do a job on your lungs.

28:22.701 --> 28:23.876
Bag it all.

28:23.876 --> 28:25.138
That's been sitting there
for years.

28:25.138 --> 28:26.443
Well, you're coming with us.
Call Carisi.

28:26.443 --> 28:29.403
Get a warrant for
Connie's arrest.

28:33.799 --> 28:35.888
That's my stash of
cocaine you found.

28:35.888 --> 28:37.150
- For personal use?
- That's right.

28:37.150 --> 28:39.065
The ME told us that
last batch that Mona got

28:39.065 --> 28:41.154
was mostly industrial abrasive.

28:41.154 --> 28:43.460
You want to tell us how
that got mixed into it?

28:43.460 --> 28:44.940
I should go to the
hospital or something?

28:44.940 --> 28:46.768
Maybe it's in my lungs.

28:46.768 --> 28:48.639
I had a cough lately.
- Nice try.

28:48.639 --> 28:50.337
You think I mixed it in?

28:50.337 --> 28:51.991
Why would I poison myself?

28:51.991 --> 28:54.515
What I want to know is what's
your relationship to Connie.

28:54.515 --> 28:56.560
I work for her, do odd jobs.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.693
- Whatever she tells you to do?
- That's right.

28:58.693 --> 29:01.174
That's what she pays me for--
hard work.

29:01.174 --> 29:03.219
Sex?

29:03.219 --> 29:05.178
And discretion.

29:05.178 --> 29:07.093
Well, if we can prove
that Mona and Martin

29:07.093 --> 29:09.791
got that cocaine from you,

29:09.791 --> 29:14.143
you're looking down the barrel
at murder.

29:15.971 --> 29:17.799
I think I need a lawyer now.

29:17.799 --> 29:20.149
He's not as dumb as he looks.

29:20.149 --> 29:22.195
If you think Connie's
going to get you a lawyer,

29:22.195 --> 29:26.460
she's already paying for a few.

29:26.460 --> 29:29.332
My client has absolutely
nothing to do with any drugs.

29:29.332 --> 29:31.073
So you had nothing
to do with murdering

29:31.073 --> 29:33.293
a woman who was
about to testify

29:33.293 --> 29:34.773
against your rapist son?

29:34.773 --> 29:36.252
Who you also
tried the poison.

29:36.252 --> 29:37.950
No.
Now why would I do that?

29:37.950 --> 29:39.560
I'm horrified.
- Mm.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.127
Now I thought I knew Henry.

29:41.127 --> 29:42.650
He's like a second son to me.

29:42.650 --> 29:44.652
Maybe Henry was
jealous of Martin,

29:44.652 --> 29:46.175
or Martin was jealous of Henry.

29:46.175 --> 29:48.177
Oh, so this is just a
cocaine and Abel story, huh?

29:48.177 --> 29:51.006
This is not about Martin.
This is not about Henry.

29:51.006 --> 29:53.835
The real jealousy here
is your jealousy,

29:53.835 --> 29:56.011
your jealousy for Mona.

29:56.011 --> 29:58.231
Oh, please,
why would I be jealous

29:58.231 --> 30:01.800
of a 22-year-old interior
decorator with horrible taste?

30:01.800 --> 30:03.714
Horrible taste?

30:03.714 --> 30:05.760
She had a taste for your son,

30:05.760 --> 30:08.458
until, of course,
he raped her.

30:08.458 --> 30:11.026
That is an unsubstantiated, uncorroborated,

30:11.026 --> 30:13.028
and unacceptably false accusation.

30:13.028 --> 30:14.682
You'll never make
a case for rape.

30:14.682 --> 30:16.075
Maybe not,
but I can definitely

30:16.075 --> 30:17.859
make a case for murder
against your client.

30:17.859 --> 30:23.517
I had nothing to do with that
poor girl's horrible death.

30:23.517 --> 30:25.214
- Connie.
- Please.

30:25.214 --> 30:27.303
Now, my son did that cocaine.

30:27.303 --> 30:30.350
Are you saying that
I poisoned him as well?

30:30.350 --> 30:32.874
That's exactly
what we're saying.

30:32.874 --> 30:35.268
Why would I do that?

30:35.268 --> 30:40.316
Have you ever heard the phrase
"devouring mother"?

30:40.316 --> 30:42.231
You're so afraid
to lose control

30:42.231 --> 30:45.887
over Martin that you
were willing to risk

30:45.887 --> 30:49.108
crippling him, or even worse.

30:49.108 --> 30:52.894
Somebody in the grave
can't leave you,

30:52.894 --> 30:56.942
and you always know
where he is.

30:59.118 --> 31:02.077
My mother loves me.

31:02.077 --> 31:04.732
She'd never let
anything happen to me.

31:04.732 --> 31:06.865
In fact,
it's just the opposite.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.214
Have you ever
heard the saying

31:08.214 --> 31:10.085
"a spoonful of
industrial abrasive

31:10.085 --> 31:12.914
helps the medicine go down"?

31:12.914 --> 31:16.091
- No.
- Neither have we.

31:16.091 --> 31:17.919
You're a smart guy.

31:17.919 --> 31:20.052
You saw your lung scan,
your asthma.

31:20.052 --> 31:21.749
So I did a little
too much coke.

31:21.749 --> 31:24.578
Keep your mouth shut.
This isn't a coffee klatsch.

31:24.578 --> 31:26.449
We're here because
of a cocaine charge?

31:26.449 --> 31:30.540
No, the coke was doctored
on your mother's orders, huh,

31:30.540 --> 31:33.935
to teach you a lesson
and to kill Mona.

31:33.935 --> 31:35.850
She'd never do that.

31:35.850 --> 31:37.896
The ME dissected
Mona's lungs.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.115
He found the same
exact substance

31:40.115 --> 31:43.553
as we found in the cocaine
on your mother's property.

31:43.553 --> 31:45.120
That's all Henry.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.818
Well, Henry didn't have
a reason to teach you a lesson,

31:47.818 --> 31:49.951
but your mom did.

31:49.951 --> 31:51.344
Why?

31:51.344 --> 31:54.956
Because she wanted
to keep you bubble wrapped

31:54.956 --> 31:57.437
all for herself,

31:57.437 --> 31:59.918
to infantilize you
so you'd always need her.

32:05.488 --> 32:07.490
It worked.

32:07.490 --> 32:09.362
I do need her.

32:09.362 --> 32:11.842
Your mother may be
going down for murder.

32:11.842 --> 32:14.802
Only if Henry
turns against her.

32:14.802 --> 32:18.327
Or you do, Martin.

32:18.327 --> 32:20.373
I want to entertain
what they're saying.

32:20.373 --> 32:22.810
No.

32:22.810 --> 32:24.986
That's never going to happen.

32:24.986 --> 32:27.946
It can't.
- Why not?

32:31.819 --> 32:34.430
You don't understand.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.828
I've already lost my father.

32:40.828 --> 32:45.485
If I lose my mother, too,
I'll...

32:45.485 --> 32:48.705
I'll be an orphan.

32:56.670 --> 32:59.020
So this caretaker, Henry--

32:59.020 --> 33:00.717
he won't turn against Connie.

33:00.717 --> 33:02.067
He lawyered up and shut up.

33:02.067 --> 33:03.546
He's in holding.

33:03.546 --> 33:05.113
Oh, it's hard to get
a guy to solve a problem

33:05.113 --> 33:06.810
that his paycheck relies on.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.856
Look, what about Martin?

33:08.856 --> 33:12.338
Is he actually that blind to
his own mother's complicity?

33:12.338 --> 33:14.035
He might be 32,
but he's like a little boy.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.602
Yeah, he's been stunted.

33:15.602 --> 33:17.560
OK, well, I cannot bring
a murder case

33:17.560 --> 33:19.214
without any corroborating witnesses.

33:19.214 --> 33:20.607
She's got plausible deniability.

33:20.607 --> 33:22.478
I know that she
kept him in the nest,

33:22.478 --> 33:26.395
but it seems like the rest
of the family wanted to run.

33:26.395 --> 33:29.050
Her father's dead.
The ex-husband is in the wind.

33:29.050 --> 33:30.704
Martin did say he's
afraid of being alone.

33:30.704 --> 33:32.923
If that is the only thing
that's keeping him

33:32.923 --> 33:34.403
from testifying,
then maybe his father

33:34.403 --> 33:36.927
can talk some sense into him.

33:36.927 --> 33:39.974
We'll track him down.

33:39.974 --> 33:42.020
You know, I hope
there's one person

33:42.020 --> 33:44.283
in this young man's life
who actually

33:44.283 --> 33:45.762
wants the best for him.

33:45.762 --> 33:47.938
Just a reminder, Liv,
Martin is a rapist.

33:47.938 --> 33:49.505
I'm not making
excuses for him,

33:49.505 --> 33:53.727
but Carisi,
he is also a victim.

33:53.727 --> 33:55.381
And if we want him to flip,

33:55.381 --> 33:58.514
then we need
to treat him like one.

34:07.219 --> 34:08.524
Peter Parish is here already?

34:08.524 --> 34:09.786
That was fast.

34:09.786 --> 34:11.223
He took a red-eye
from the Azores.

34:11.223 --> 34:13.007
So he really does care
about his son, huh?

34:13.007 --> 34:14.226
He wasn't surprised
to hear his

34:14.226 --> 34:15.836
ex-wife was a murder suspect.

34:15.836 --> 34:17.881
OK, and that's the
current Mrs. Parish?

34:17.881 --> 34:20.188
That's Bianca,
their former nanny,

34:20.188 --> 34:21.320
with their baby daughter.

34:21.320 --> 34:22.277
And we sent Connie home?

34:22.277 --> 34:23.670
With Martin.

34:23.670 --> 34:25.019
We didn't have enough
to hold either of them.

34:25.019 --> 34:26.977
Well, it's a damn shame.
She's missing this.

34:26.977 --> 34:29.806
Uh, invite Martin
and Connie back.

34:29.806 --> 34:31.243
All right, Muncy, will you?
- Yeah.

34:31.243 --> 34:33.027
Yeah, I got you.
- Thanks.

34:35.377 --> 34:36.944
You ready?

34:36.944 --> 34:39.773
Mr. Parish, thank you
for coming in so quickly.

34:39.773 --> 34:41.122
I was hoping that
my son would be here.

34:41.122 --> 34:43.385
Well, he's on his way.
I'm ADA Carisi.

34:43.385 --> 34:45.083
We got a few questions
for you, if you don't mind.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.084
Sure.

34:46.084 --> 34:49.609
So I'm going
to jump right in.

34:49.609 --> 34:53.091
Can you tell us why
you left your family?

34:53.091 --> 34:54.962
Uh, well,

34:54.962 --> 34:57.486
Connie tried to murder me.

34:57.486 --> 34:58.748
What happened?

34:58.748 --> 35:00.663
She was putting
industrial-grade abrasives

35:00.663 --> 35:02.491
into my smoothies.

35:02.491 --> 35:04.319
I started to have
digestive problems

35:04.319 --> 35:06.060
and internal bleeding.

35:06.060 --> 35:09.498
I was slowly dying, and Bianca
put two and two together.

35:09.498 --> 35:14.068
I--I didn't just run away with
her because she's the nanny.

35:14.068 --> 35:15.678
She saved my life.

35:15.678 --> 35:18.551
You have any idea why your
wife would want to poison you?

35:18.551 --> 35:21.162
Any idea?
I know absolutely why.

35:24.774 --> 35:28.126
Martin was 12, and by then,

35:28.126 --> 35:31.041
I was already
cheating on Connie.

35:31.041 --> 35:34.262
And she sought comfort
in the wrong place.

35:34.262 --> 35:38.745
She was--
I don't know how to say this.

35:38.745 --> 35:43.358
She was nestled up with Martin.

35:43.358 --> 35:46.535
I caught them in bed together.

35:46.535 --> 35:49.625
I think she was
breastfeeding him.

35:49.625 --> 35:52.237
- Did you confront her?
- Of course.

35:52.237 --> 35:54.891
She begged me not to talk
to Martin about it,

35:54.891 --> 35:56.502
and she swore that
it would stop.

35:56.502 --> 35:58.765
- But it didn't.
- I don't know.

35:58.765 --> 36:00.636
I hoped so.

36:00.636 --> 36:02.247
I had moved out
to the guest house

36:02.247 --> 36:04.292
to try to figure out
my next move,

36:04.292 --> 36:05.815
and then a few days later,

36:05.815 --> 36:07.600
I noticed the decline
in my health.

36:07.600 --> 36:10.429
Then you left with the nanny.

36:10.429 --> 36:11.908
Yeah, I couldn't stay.

36:11.908 --> 36:16.391
But you left Martin with her.

36:16.391 --> 36:18.306
I thought I was doing
the right thing at the time.

36:18.306 --> 36:20.265
And I had asked him
to move to the Azores with us,

36:20.265 --> 36:21.440
and he said no.

36:21.440 --> 36:25.792
But you didn't call
child services?

36:25.792 --> 36:28.098
I didn't want him to
end up in foster care.

36:28.098 --> 36:31.928
A dysfunctional mother
is better than no mother.

36:31.928 --> 36:37.151
OK, look,
whatever you think of me,

36:37.151 --> 36:40.241
I love my son.

36:53.298 --> 36:56.301
Oh, Dad,
I missed you so much.

36:56.301 --> 36:58.912
Oh, I missed you, too.

36:58.912 --> 37:01.958
What Mom did,
I had nothing to do with that.

37:01.958 --> 37:03.960
I made a mistake,
and I deserve to be punished.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.962
But I can't do it alone.

37:05.962 --> 37:08.269
Don't worry.
I'm here for you.

37:12.360 --> 37:15.407
Peter?

37:15.407 --> 37:17.887
You think you can just
waltz back into our lives

37:17.887 --> 37:20.281
and steal my baby away from me?

37:20.281 --> 37:22.283
I'm never going to
let that happen.

37:22.283 --> 37:24.546
It'll be hard to stop
from a prison cell, Connie.

37:24.546 --> 37:26.809
I had nothing to do
with killing that girl.

37:26.809 --> 37:29.290
No, but you tried to kill me.

37:29.290 --> 37:31.814
That plan didn't work out
so well, did it?

37:31.814 --> 37:33.338
Oh, there she is.

37:33.338 --> 37:34.817
You steal my husband,
and now you're laughing at me,

37:34.817 --> 37:36.079
you little bitch?

37:36.079 --> 37:38.168
Mom, stop it.
Leave her alone.

37:38.168 --> 37:41.215
- Martin--
- Leave me alone.

37:41.215 --> 37:43.826
- You don't mean that.
- I do.

37:43.826 --> 37:46.481
Mrs. Parish,
let's step into my office.

37:46.481 --> 37:48.918
Not without me.

37:48.918 --> 37:50.572
I don't need you.

37:50.572 --> 37:53.314
I don't need anyone,

37:53.314 --> 37:56.796
not even you, Martin!

37:56.796 --> 37:58.798
All right, let's go.

37:58.798 --> 38:01.017
Let's go.

38:01.017 --> 38:04.369
Hey, bud, come here.

38:07.502 --> 38:10.200
Well, congratulations, Captain.

38:10.200 --> 38:14.683
You've managed to turn
my son against me.

38:14.683 --> 38:15.902
You call this police work?

38:15.902 --> 38:18.687
You just don't get it,
do you?

38:18.687 --> 38:20.210
Your son's a rapist.

38:20.210 --> 38:21.821
OK, I don't want
to keep hearing that.

38:21.821 --> 38:23.213
I raised a good boy.

38:23.213 --> 38:26.042
No, you raised a son
who is still a little boy

38:26.042 --> 38:29.132
who is afraid
of displeasing you,

38:29.132 --> 38:31.439
so he does everything
that you tell him to do.

38:31.439 --> 38:33.920
You've crippled him,
and that is not parenting.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.183
Parenting?

38:36.183 --> 38:39.360
I had no parenting.
I parented myself.

38:39.360 --> 38:43.364
That house you went to,
that was my father's real child,

38:43.364 --> 38:46.846
and I swore I would never
let that happen to my son.

38:46.846 --> 38:50.110
I'm a tough woman,
and I'm a tough mother

38:50.110 --> 38:53.418
because I want
what's best for Martin,

38:53.418 --> 38:56.856
because my career

38:56.856 --> 38:59.859
wasn't the most important thing
in my life.

38:59.859 --> 39:03.732
He was.

39:03.732 --> 39:05.691
He needed me.

39:05.691 --> 39:09.738
Maybe when he was little,
but you never let him grow up.

39:09.738 --> 39:11.392
He wasn't ready.

39:11.392 --> 39:13.655
Is that what you
tell yourself?

39:13.655 --> 39:16.702
No, Connie, you see,

39:16.702 --> 39:20.575
you needed him,
and you used him.

39:20.575 --> 39:22.708
He loves me, and I love him.

39:22.708 --> 39:25.406
That's not love.

39:25.406 --> 39:28.409
That's not mothering.

39:28.409 --> 39:29.932
That's narcissism.

39:29.932 --> 39:32.413
OK, that's enough.

39:32.413 --> 39:35.634
I know that your
husband wasn't perfect,

39:35.634 --> 39:37.940
and misguided as it was,

39:37.940 --> 39:42.858
he did what he thought
was right.

39:42.858 --> 39:49.169
But now,
he's putting Martin first.

39:50.997 --> 39:54.957
That's love, Connie.

40:00.876 --> 40:02.791
That's love.

40:19.852 --> 40:21.027
We just made a deal.

40:21.027 --> 40:22.985
Connie took a plea
to manslaughter.

40:22.985 --> 40:24.465
She didn't want Martin to
have to get on the stand

40:24.465 --> 40:26.075
and testify against her.

40:26.075 --> 40:28.077
No, she knew if she
was found guilty at trial

40:28.077 --> 40:29.427
that she'd do
double the sentence.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.602
Oh, spoken like
a true pessimist.

40:30.602 --> 40:31.994
I'm not a pessimist.

40:31.994 --> 40:35.694
I'm a realist, and I just
know how sociopaths work.

40:35.694 --> 40:37.478
Connie Parish has a--

40:37.478 --> 40:40.568
has a pathology where
a personality should be.

40:40.568 --> 40:43.484
Eh, neglect will
do that to you, huh?

40:43.484 --> 40:45.747
What about Martin?
The guy's still a rapist.

40:45.747 --> 40:47.532
Yeah, his father says
that he'll stick by him

40:47.532 --> 40:49.359
as long as he confesses
to Mona's rape.

40:49.359 --> 40:52.493
He's going to confess?
So he'll do time.

40:52.493 --> 40:54.669
It's not a happy ending, but
it's an ending nonetheless.

40:54.669 --> 40:56.715
Oh, look who's
a pessimist now.

40:56.715 --> 40:58.238
You headed home?

40:58.238 --> 41:01.023
Yeah, you know, it's just
been one of those days.

41:01.023 --> 41:02.155
The only sane way
to deal with it

41:02.155 --> 41:03.591
is a nice glass of Cabernet.

41:03.591 --> 41:07.726
I'm thinking more like
a hug from my son.

41:07.726 --> 41:10.511
Good night, Benson.

41:10.511 --> 41:12.470
Good night, Carisi.
