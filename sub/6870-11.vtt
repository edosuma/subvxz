WEBVTT

00:01.979 --> 00:07.150
(alarm wails) (fierce
whistling) (explosion)

00:07.284 --> 00:10.720
CHERLENE: Woooo! Outlaw country!
Outlaw co...

00:10.854 --> 00:13.423
(gags) LANA: Stop it.
CHERLENE (hoarse): Make me.

00:13.557 --> 00:16.626
(whistling, explosion) MALORY: Lana.
Are you crazy?

00:16.760 --> 00:19.629
LANA: No, she is. See? MALORY:
Let go of her throat,

00:19.763 --> 00:23.099
She-Hulk, those pipes just sold a million
records. CALDERÓN: Which is amazing,

00:23.233 --> 00:25.601
can you believe it is so amazing?
Everyone, toast.

00:25.736 --> 00:28.805
(explosion) MALORY AND LANA: Whoa!
COMANDANTE: <i> Presidente,</i> this

00:28.939 --> 00:32.141
is no time for toast. CALDERÓN: Wha...
No, not "toast,"<i> a</i> toast.

00:32.276 --> 00:35.178
A toast. COMANDANTE: It is
even less the time for that.

00:35.312 --> 00:38.848
MALORY: Calm down, Colonel Panic.
Listen-- the shelling has

00:38.983 --> 00:41.784
stopped. (Pam grunts
loudly) (dishes break)

00:41.919 --> 00:44.487
RAY: Damn it, Pam. CALDERÓN:
Why the hell did you do that?

00:44.621 --> 00:47.156
PAM: So we can scrooch down behind it.
MALORY: The shelling...

00:47.291 --> 00:49.759
has stopped. PAM: Oh,
did you just say that?

00:49.893 --> 00:52.362
LANA: Goddamn it. Is everybody okay?
MALORY: Yes.

00:52.496 --> 00:55.198
CHERLENE: Yeah, I guess. CYRIL
(laughing): I don't know.

00:55.332 --> 00:58.134
CALDERÓN: Wait a minute, where is my wife?
MALORY: And where is

00:58.268 --> 01:01.070
Sterling? ARCHER
(muffled): What's that?

01:01.205 --> 01:05.408
I mean, yes, what? What are we doing?
MALORY: What are <i> you</i> doing?

01:05.542 --> 01:09.245
CALDERÓN: Why were you in the butler's
pantry? ARCHER: I-I was, uh, I was

01:09.380 --> 01:12.448
hiding because I was scared.
CHERLENE: Yeah, right. LANA: Really.

01:12.583 --> 01:16.486
ARCHER: Well, fairly. But I-I mean, I found
a paper bag in there, and I did some

01:16.620 --> 01:19.589
deep, uh... LANA: Breathing?
ARCHER: Also, yes, so, hey,

01:19.723 --> 01:22.458
what's the plan? CALDERÓN:
We must counterattack.

01:22.593 --> 01:25.495
COMANDANTE: But, sir, I don't have enough
troops. CALDERÓN: Oh, my God, always

01:25.629 --> 01:28.589
with the excuses. COMANDANTE: Sir, you
have an entire battalion sitting idle

01:28.632 --> 01:31.512
at the airport, so... CALDERÓN: No,
they are not sitting idle, they are...

01:31.635 --> 01:34.504
COMANDANTE: Unloading the one million
record albums you bought from this <i> gringa.</i>

01:34.638 --> 01:36.879
ARCHER: What? CHERLENE: Wait, what?
CALDERÓN (soft laugh):

01:37.007 --> 01:39.876
Surprise. JULIANA: Wait, what?
LANA: Non-surprise.

01:40.010 --> 01:42.712
ARCHER: Can you not? LANA: Can <i> you</i> not?
CHERLENE: I thought people

01:42.846 --> 01:45.415
liked me. JULIANA: I
thought we were broke.

01:45.549 --> 01:48.790
CALDERÓN: I... that's... CHERLENE AND
JULIANA: Do you have any idea how humiliating

01:48.819 --> 01:52.188
this is? PAM: Jinx.
(Cherlene sobs)

01:52.322 --> 01:55.191
Inappropes. CALDERÓN: Cherlene, wait.
JULIANA (gasps): Well, now

01:55.325 --> 01:58.428
it's your turn to be humiliated, Gustavo.
Because for your information,

01:58.562 --> 02:01.431
I just had... (gunshot)
LANA: Cyril?

02:01.565 --> 02:05.735
(Cyril grunts, exhales) ARCHER: Oh.
My God.

02:05.869 --> 02:11.304
The gun went off for, like, no reason.
Surprise.

(glass shatters) JULIANA: $10 million.
On... on cowboy music?

02:55.376 --> 02:59.346
CALDERÓN: Eee! Cowboy music?
COMANDANTE: <i> Presidente,</i>

02:59.480 --> 03:03.250
please, permission to redeploy the troops
at the airport. CALDERÓN: Ay, aah!

03:03.384 --> 03:07.020
Jesus Christ, fine. Whatever you want.
COMANDANTE: Bravo Two, this

03:07.155 --> 03:10.057
is Bravo Actual. Redeploy
your troops to sector four.

03:10.191 --> 03:13.694
JULIANA: Well, I am redeploying
to my rooms. CALDERÓN: Well, I am

03:13.828 --> 03:18.999
redeploying to <i> my</i> rooms. MALORY:
My God, why was she so upset?

03:19.133 --> 03:22.803
ARCHER: Well, I think any time a spouse makes
a major purchase without discussing it

03:22.937 --> 03:25.305
first... MALORY: I meant
Cherlene, you pea-wit.

03:25.440 --> 03:28.709
Why does she care? Most singers would
kill to have a record go platinum.

03:28.843 --> 03:31.712
(Lana clears throat) LANA:
Speaking of killing people.

03:31.846 --> 03:36.817
ARCHER: Oh, my God, okay, first of all,
he... Actually, yeah, Pam, let's hear

03:36.951 --> 03:40.253
some Bee Gees. (Pam breathes deeply)
CYRIL (high-pitched): Ha, ha,

03:40.388 --> 03:44.157
ha, ha. PAM: Stayin' alive.
(laughing): Holy shit, that

03:44.292 --> 03:48.161
works. CYRIL: Agh. ARCHER:
Yeah, so does Kevlar.

03:48.296 --> 03:51.465
LANA: Wait, so does what? PAM: What,
did you just want mouth-to-mouth?

03:51.599 --> 03:54.101
CYRIL: I can explain. LANA:
What is this, <i>Meatballs?</i>

03:54.235 --> 03:57.104
You little... ARCHER: Racist.
What?

03:57.238 --> 04:00.173
Cyril, you wear Kevlar every single
time we go to Latin America.

04:00.308 --> 04:03.944
CYRIL: Because every time you shoot me.
ARCHER: Whoa, whoa, whoa, not

04:04.078 --> 04:07.481
every time. Mm, like,
three out of four, tops.

04:07.615 --> 04:11.485
You big baby. LANA: Also speaking of...
MALORY: Ugh, here it comes.

04:11.619 --> 04:14.488
LANA: No, actually, here it goes.
I'm leaving.

04:14.622 --> 04:17.491
Ray, airport, let's go. ARCHER:
Have you lost your mind?

04:17.625 --> 04:21.161
RAY: Seriously, I am not your servant.
Ow, quit-quit...

04:21.295 --> 04:25.132
Ow, ow, goddamn it! ARCHER: Not that.
Lana, in case you haven't

04:25.266 --> 04:29.002
noticed, this place is crawling with
rebels. PAM: And not the good kind

04:29.137 --> 04:32.617
you get drunk with at Myrtle Beach and cruise
the strip in the bed of their monster truck

04:32.673 --> 04:37.344
with a big rebel flag on it,
flinging empty longnecks at people.

04:37.478 --> 04:41.948
LANA: Yeah, those aren't actually the
good kind, either. PAM: Now who's racist?

04:42.083 --> 04:45.218
ARCHER: Those guys, Pam, those exact
same guys you just described.

04:45.353 --> 04:48.989
PAM: Oh. Well now I feel like an asshole.
MALORY: When do you not?

04:49.123 --> 04:53.493
PAM: Almost always. I really like me.
MALORY: Baffling.

04:53.628 --> 04:57.397
As is leaving before Calderón pays us
for that shipment of weapons, so...

04:57.532 --> 05:01.001
LANA (scoffs): When was that supposed to
happen? After a lovely dinner with him

05:01.135 --> 05:04.137
and his freshly-banged first lady?
MALORY: His...

05:04.272 --> 05:07.174
What are you talking about? LANA: I'm
talking about Archer, who just...

05:07.308 --> 05:12.279
(gunshot) ARCHER: Oops.
MALORY: Give me that.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.282
ARCHER: Mother, be careful, that
crazy thing's got a mind of its own.

05:15.416 --> 05:18.285
MALORY: And it's not the only thing.
Why can't you keep it in your

05:18.419 --> 05:22.022
pants? ARCHER: Oof.
(coughs): Oh, Mother.

05:22.156 --> 05:26.526
(Cyril cackles) ARCHER: It's not
funny, I actually use mine.

05:26.661 --> 05:30.564
LANA: Yes, always. God, you're...
What happened to no more

05:30.698 --> 05:33.567
anonymous sex? ARCHER: I...
we had already met.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.661
LANA: Not the first time. ARCHER: The
first time I thought she was the maid.

05:36.704 --> 05:40.273
MALORY: Why would you have sex with a maid?
ARCHER: That doesn't merit a

05:40.408 --> 05:43.543
response, Mother, and the second time she
blackmailed me. MALORY: How did she blackmail

05:43.678 --> 05:46.947
you? ARCHER: By threatening to
tell Calderón about the first

05:47.081 --> 05:50.884
time. MALORY: That's the honeypot.
How could you fall for that?

05:51.018 --> 05:54.387
It's Espionage 101. ARCHER:
I know, it's pretty ironic.

05:54.522 --> 05:58.925
But, also, I always fall for it. MALORY: And
now what's to stop her from telling him about

05:59.060 --> 06:03.330
the second time? ARCHER: Hmm.
Nothing, (chuckles) she's crazy.

06:03.464 --> 06:07.434
Ow, ow, Lana, quit it, ow. Ow, goddamn it.
LANA: Asshole.

06:07.568 --> 06:11.972
CYRIL: We're dead. You've killed us.
ARCHER: Me?

06:12.106 --> 06:16.109
I didn't have a follow-up... to that.
MALORY: Oh, all right, Lana,

06:16.244 --> 06:21.515
you win. PAM: Yay!
LANA: Win what?

06:21.649 --> 06:24.518
MALORY: We're leaving right now-- Ray?
RAY: Already packing

06:24.652 --> 06:27.220
mentally. MALORY: Damn it,
man, forget your kimonos.

06:27.355 --> 06:30.223
RAY: Oh, like I brought a huge stack.
CYRIL: Five's a pretty big

06:30.358 --> 06:32.959
stack. MALORY: Cyril, shut
up and go find a vehicle.

06:33.094 --> 06:36.930
Ray, find Cherlene. No matter what
happens, we can't leave without her.

06:37.064 --> 06:40.166
LANA: She said, suddenly oddly maternal.
ARCHER: Right?

06:40.301 --> 06:43.169
MALORY: She has to endorse the royalty
checks. LANA (English accent): And

06:43.304 --> 06:46.406
the penny drops. MALORY: You shut up,
and the rest of you shut up and grab

06:46.541 --> 06:50.110
anything valuable. Ooh, like
that ridiculous white painting.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.612
PAM: Wait, what about Krieger?
MALORY: Oh, for...

06:52.747 --> 06:55.582
Who cares about Krieger? RAY: Yeah.
CYRIL: That's true.

06:55.716 --> 06:59.319
PAM: Plus, I bet the vampires got him.
(Krieger whimpers)

06:59.453 --> 07:06.226
(sobbing) CLONE: So... now
will you join us... brother?

07:06.360 --> 07:14.089
KRIEGER (sobbing): Yes...(sobbing)
CLONES: Clone bone!

07:17.743 --> 07:21.971
KRIEGER: My God, I have so many questions.
Are you clones of me?

07:22.164 --> 07:25.500
Am I a clone of you? Did you all grow up
together... in an actual house with an

07:25.634 --> 07:29.204
actual mom and dad? And was I ever there?
CLONE: No.

07:29.338 --> 07:32.540
CLONE 2: To all of it. KRIEGER: You sure?
Because I have this very clear

07:32.675 --> 07:35.543
memory of me as a child, and it's snowing, and
there's a creepy old man trying to take me

07:35.678 --> 07:39.080
away, and then I knock him down with a
sled? CLONE 3: That's <i> Citizen Kane.</i>

07:39.215 --> 07:43.551
KRIEGER: Oh. Wait. No, not a sled.
A pneumatic bolt-gun.

07:43.686 --> 07:46.988
CLONE 3: Now that does sound
vaguely familiar. KRIEGER: Right?

07:47.122 --> 07:50.024
CLONE 2: Wait. No. I remember
blood on snow. KRIEGER: Right?!

07:50.159 --> 07:53.027
CLONE 1: No! That was something else!
He was never with us as a

07:53.162 --> 07:55.897
child! CLONE 2: Well, the important
thing is that you're with us

07:56.031 --> 07:59.133
now. CLONE 3: Especially
since your friends...

07:59.268 --> 08:02.036
KRIEGER: "Friends." Please. Can you believe
those jerks? After all these years?

08:02.171 --> 08:05.406
Kicking me to the curb like, like...
CLONE 1: A child.

08:05.541 --> 08:08.543
CLONE 2: A frog! CLONE 3: Frog-child!
(load croaking)

08:08.677 --> 08:12.146
CLONES: No! KRIEGER Is...
is that what I think it is?

08:12.281 --> 08:15.350
CLONES: No. KRIEGER: Well, let me
finish, because I think it's some kind

08:15.484 --> 08:19.020
of unholy, adolescent human-amphibian
hybrid creature. CLONE 2: Oh.

08:19.154 --> 08:24.225
Then, yes. KRIEGER: I'm home.
I'm finally home.

08:24.360 --> 08:28.897
CLONE 1: Just in time for our moment of
triumph. KRIEGER: Well, if there's one

08:29.031 --> 08:33.001
thing I love, it's triumph! What is it?!
CLONE 2: All will be

08:33.135 --> 08:37.938
revealed... in time. KRIEGER: And if there's
one thing I love more than triumph,

08:38.073 --> 08:43.044
it's annoying vagueness. CYRIL (as Malory):
Cyril, shut up and find a vehicle!

08:43.178 --> 08:46.548
Meh, heh, heh. I'm a hateful shrew!
And this is my idiot son,

08:46.682 --> 08:50.151
Archer. He's going to screw the
dictator's wife and then shoot

08:50.286 --> 08:53.821
you in the chest! (as himself):
Oh, makes me so mad!

08:53.956 --> 09:00.028
One of these days, I swear to...
Jesus H. Chrysler! (clacking)

09:00.162 --> 09:04.532
Well, one thing's for sure. If I had
it to do over, I'd be a dictator.

09:04.667 --> 09:08.169
CALDERÓN: What?! My God, come on.
How can you even say that?

09:08.304 --> 09:11.873
CHERLENE: Because that's what you are!
CALDERÓN: Cherlene, I-I...

09:12.007 --> 09:17.045
I'm not a dictator! I'm a president,
like your Jorge Washington!

09:17.179 --> 09:20.659
CHERLENE: Jorge Washington-- which, apparently,
I've been mispronouncing wrong this whole

09:20.749 --> 09:24.285
time-- wasn't president for life!
CALDERÓN: Uh, but he could

09:24.420 --> 09:28.122
have been if he wanted. Look, the
22nd amendment to your constitution

09:28.257 --> 09:33.161
imposed the presidential term limits, but it
wasn't passed by your congress until 1947, and

09:33.295 --> 09:37.632
not ratified by the requisite number
of American states until 1951, so...

09:37.766 --> 09:41.336
CHERLENE: Who are you-- Dave Frishberg?!
CALDERÓN: Yeah, I don't know

09:41.470 --> 09:44.539
who that is. CHERLENE: Of course
you don't, because you don't live

09:44.673 --> 09:48.509
in a free country, where the world's largest
manufacturers of sugary cereals are allowed to

09:48.644 --> 09:53.214
sponsor interstitial animated programming
unapologetically targeted at children!

09:53.349 --> 09:56.684
CALDERÓN: No. I-I live in a very
poor country. CHERLENE: Ugh!

09:56.819 --> 10:00.388
CALDERÓN: No, no. I... Look, I know, but
go outside the palace walls, and trust me,

10:00.522 --> 10:04.058
Cherlene, listen, it is crazy poor.
CHERLENE: Yeah, that was

10:04.193 --> 10:07.395
my whole... CALDERÓN: And so, I wanted
to distribute your records among--

10:07.529 --> 10:10.732
and I hate to say this-- but our filthy peasants,
so as to brighten their lives with your

10:10.866 --> 10:14.268
music. CHERLENE: Oh. Well,
now I feel like a...

10:14.403 --> 10:17.772
Wait. Do they even have record players?
CALDERÓN: Well, no, obviously

10:17.906 --> 10:21.476
not, but... CHERLENE: So how
would they even use records?!

10:21.610 --> 10:25.647
CALDERÓN: As plates? LANA: What, in the
name of all that is stupid, do you think

10:25.781 --> 10:29.317
you're doing? (Archer sighs)
ARCHER: You tell me, crazy

10:29.451 --> 10:33.488
pregnant hormone lady. What's it look like
I'm doing?! B-But before you answer, please

10:33.622 --> 10:37.725
don't say "literally being emasculated,"
because I looked that up, and... ick.

10:37.860 --> 10:41.396
LANA: Hold it up. ARCHER: Lana, come on.
You and Mother smashed my balls

10:41.530 --> 10:45.066
pretty good. Kudos. They're swollen.
But I-I don't need a cut man!

10:45.200 --> 10:48.503
LANA: The painting... you idiot.
ARCHER: Oh.

10:48.637 --> 10:52.318
Thought you meant my genitals. But, look, I know
you're jealous I had sex with Juliana, almost

10:52.341 --> 10:55.710
twice, but don't slash the painting.
It's...

10:55.844 --> 10:59.747
(high-pitched voice): Priceless. LANA:
But worthless... if you damage it.

10:59.882 --> 11:04.652
But even though it's very delicate, it can
withstand a surprising amount of shit.

11:04.787 --> 11:08.790
ARCHER: Wait. Is this an extremely
ill-phrased analogy about my penis?

11:08.924 --> 11:14.762
LANA: Yes, Archer, it is, because everything,
everywhere, every when, is about the paragon

11:14.897 --> 11:20.301
of adequacy that is your dick. ARCHER:
"Adequacy" as in "mind-blowingness"?

11:20.436 --> 11:23.771
Or "adequacy" as in "Hey, stupid,
you just destroyed $40 million"?!

11:23.906 --> 11:27.508
LANA: As in neither, you dummy.
This is how you steal a

11:27.643 --> 11:31.179
painting. Did you never see
<i> The Thomas Crown Affair?</i>

11:31.313 --> 11:34.682
ARCHER: Uh, no, not a huge Steve
McQueen fan. (Lana laughs)

11:34.817 --> 11:41.489
LANA: Oh, my God, are you...? Archer, you
used to moan about him in your sleep!

11:41.623 --> 11:46.194
ARCHER: I-I... No, I didn't.
CYRIL: Come on, you can do

11:46.328 --> 11:49.664
this. Just pick a stupid car. But
the perfect car, so that for

11:49.798 --> 11:53.334
once in her life, Ms. Archer can't bitch.
And we'll be driving through a

11:53.469 --> 11:57.505
war zone, so it needs to be fast, although
I guess reliability is more important

11:57.639 --> 12:01.175
than speed. Well, up to a point.
Although bulletproof glass

12:01.310 --> 12:05.546
wouldn't be bad. I... Damn it, Figgis!
You're overthinking this!

12:05.681 --> 12:10.618
Oh. Now that is a vehicle. Hmm.

12:10.753 --> 12:14.288
Let's see Ms. Archer bitch about that.
MALORY: You idiot!

12:14.423 --> 12:17.792
I gave you one simple job, and...
RAY: I looked in her room!

12:17.926 --> 12:21.462
MALORY: And?! RAY: And she wasn't in it?
(thudding, grunting)

12:21.597 --> 12:25.099
MALORY: Pam, if you want to scuff them
that badly, just throw them down the...

12:25.234 --> 12:27.435
(Pam grunts, thudding)

12:28.737 --> 12:32.507
(Malory sighs heavily) PAM: What,
were you not gonna say stairs?

12:32.641 --> 12:36.544
ARCHER: Hang on, hang on! Wait, wait, wait.
Damn it! I have something for this.

12:36.678 --> 12:40.381
It's um, uh... MALORY: Well, I just
assume it was about that ad with the

12:40.516 --> 12:43.885
suitcase and the gorilla. PAM: Ouch.
LANA: Which, turns out, was

12:44.019 --> 12:47.355
actually a man in a gorilla costume.
MALORY: Making the comparison

12:47.489 --> 12:50.825
even more accurate. CALDERÓN: Ow!
PAM: Seriously.

12:50.959 --> 12:53.919
CHERLENE: Let go of me! RAY: There, I
found her. CALDERÓN: Cherlene, please!

12:53.962 --> 12:56.831
CHERLENE: No, I said! CALDERÓN:
B-But, Cherlene, listen, I love you!

12:56.965 --> 13:00.268
I-I will divorce my wife. (Juliana
gasps) JULIANA: You what?!

13:00.402 --> 13:03.371
CALDERÓN: Oh, don't act so surprised,
Juliana! It's not like we're in love

13:03.505 --> 13:06.707
anymore! JULIANA: Anymore?!
We were never in love!

13:06.842 --> 13:10.211
ARCHER: And suddenly I don't feel so bad.
LANA: You did before?

13:10.345 --> 13:13.381
ARCHER Oh, my God, you have no idea.
It's like this ache in the pit

13:13.515 --> 13:16.717
of your stomach. LANA: Are you
talking about your balls?

13:16.852 --> 13:19.887
ARCHER: Yeah, but it's wearing off now.
JULIANA: And I will tell you

13:20.022 --> 13:23.224
the same thing I told your father!
I will never give you a divorce!

13:23.358 --> 13:26.360
CALDERÓN: Tell that to the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court.

13:26.495 --> 13:29.697
Oh, wait, you just did! CHERLENE: Wait.
You can't be both!

13:29.832 --> 13:32.867
CALDERÓN: Your William Howard Taft was.
CHERLENE: Not at the same

13:33.001 --> 13:36.204
time! CALDERÓN: He absolutely was.
CHERLENE: Is that true?

13:36.338 --> 13:39.407
LANA: Oh, I don't want to... RAY:
I want to say church and state?

13:39.541 --> 13:42.977
ARCHER: Wow. We get home, first thing,
we are binge-watching <i> Schoolhouse Rock.</i>

13:43.111 --> 13:45.479
JULIANA: You can binge-watch it in hell!
(others gasp)

13:45.614 --> 13:47.882
ARCHER: Well, if anything, that's heaven.
JULIANA: And you can die

13:48.016 --> 13:52.220
knowing that the last man inside
of me was Archer. CALDERÓN: What?

13:52.354 --> 13:55.223
(others chatter) ARCHER: Oh,
uh, yeah, so about that...

13:55.357 --> 13:58.292
CALDERÓN: Well, I hope it was worth
dying for. ARCHER: Honestly?

13:58.427 --> 14:01.796
JULIANA: Right? ARCHER: I...
Well, no, but the first time...

14:01.930 --> 14:05.166
JULIANA: Honestly? ARCHER: No, the
first time. CALDERÓN: Good-bye, Mr.

14:05.300 --> 14:08.803
Archer. Give my regards
to William Howard Taft.

14:08.937 --> 14:18.279
ARCHER (slow motion): No. PAM (slow motion):
No....! OTHERS (slow motion): No...!

14:27.086 --> 14:32.226
ARCHER (slow motion): Pam? (clears
throat) (normal voice): Pam?

14:37.032 --> 14:41.575
ARCHER: Pam, seriously. LANA: Archer...
ARCHER: Lana, shut up. Pam!

14:41.695 --> 14:45.773
LANA: Archer, I think she's...
(sniffles) I think she's...

14:45.907 --> 14:50.277
CALDERÓN: Dead. (crying) And now
you, Mr. Archer, can join her in...

14:50.412 --> 14:54.014
CHERLENE: Out... law... country.
(Juliana screaming)

14:54.149 --> 14:58.085
(gunshots) (Calderón grunting)
I'm gonna go Jerry Lee

14:58.219 --> 15:02.956
on your ass! (Juliana
screaming) (gunshots)

15:03.091 --> 15:07.761
LANA: Um, do you want to...? ARCHER: Yes.
Wait, were you gonna say "watch"?

15:07.896 --> 15:10.864
LANA: I was gonna say "help," but...
ARCHER: Shut up. Did she say

15:10.999 --> 15:13.934
she used to be married to Calderón's
father? PAM: (sniffs) Yeah, that's

15:14.069 --> 15:17.271
some messed-up shit. RAY: Hey!
ARCHER: Pam!

15:17.405 --> 15:21.275
LANA: How are you not dead? PAM:
(chuckles) 'Cause I'm not a pussy?

15:21.409 --> 15:24.311
And also probably 'cause of this.
MALORY: Is that Cyril's?

15:24.446 --> 15:27.314
PAM: Yep. RAY: Um... ARCHER:
You know they're not

15:27.449 --> 15:30.449
reusable, right? Once the fibers get
damaged, that's basically just a sweater

15:30.518 --> 15:33.987
vest. PAM (sucks air
through teeth): Oh, good.

15:34.122 --> 15:38.025
'Cause for a second there, I thought I
actually was a pussy. ARCHER: Hurts, huh?

15:38.159 --> 15:41.028
(Cherlene and Juliana screaming)
(Cherlene shouts) RAY: Hey, so...

15:41.162 --> 15:43.997
LANA: Yeah. Now do you want to help?
ARCHER (sighs, groans): Okay,

15:44.132 --> 15:47.000
Mother, give me my gun. MALORY: I
don't have it-- I threw it away.

15:47.135 --> 15:50.003
LANA: You what?! RAY: What?!
ARCHER: Why would you throw

15:50.138 --> 15:53.374
away a perfectly good gun?! MALORY:
Because it touched your... junk.

15:53.508 --> 15:56.910
ARCHER: How dirty do you think my junk is?
MALORY: As dirty as if it

15:57.045 --> 16:00.981
were made of dirt and then got dropped in some
different dirt and then Pig-Pen came along and

16:01.116 --> 16:04.151
kicked it around with his dirty shoes.
ARCHER: Fair enough.

16:04.285 --> 16:07.287
(gunshot) (Lana and Malory
gasp) CALDERÓN: Nobody move.

16:07.422 --> 16:13.427
Except you, Juliana. Let go of
Cherlene and throw down the gun.

16:13.561 --> 16:17.231
Now, then... JULIANA: Ow, ow, ow, ow.
Stop it. Stop it.

16:17.365 --> 16:20.234
Ow. No. Ow, ow, ow. Ooh...
(gunshot) CALDERÓN: Now, then!

16:20.368 --> 16:25.205
Cherlene, stop this at once. As your
husband, I command you. (others gasp)

16:25.340 --> 16:28.809
CHERLENE: My what?! CALDERÓN: Sorry, hang
on. Juliana, I divorce you, but also

16:28.943 --> 16:33.080
I wish you the best of luck in the years
ahead, which you will spend in prison.

16:33.214 --> 16:38.318
Cherlene, I now pronounce us husband and
wife. PAM (sniffs): Weddings always

16:38.453 --> 16:41.722
get me. LANA: Plus cocaine. CHERLENE: No!
We are so not

16:41.856 --> 16:44.725
married! Are you...?
Wait, which is it?

16:44.859 --> 16:47.728
ARCHER: Literally. CHERLENE:
Are you literally insane?!

16:47.862 --> 16:51.398
CALDERÓN: No, but my word is literally law.
One of the perks of being a

16:51.533 --> 16:54.735
dictator. CHERLENE: You said
you weren't a dictator!

16:54.869 --> 16:59.206
CALDERÓN: I-I lied, okay? But hopefully our
marriage is strong enough that, together and

16:59.340 --> 17:02.209
over time, we can work through it.
ARCHER: Well, at least he

17:02.343 --> 17:05.212
admits he was wrong. LANA: Yeah,
'cause that makes it all better.

17:05.346 --> 17:08.214
ARCHER: When did you get so cynical?
CALDERÓN: The rest of you...

17:08.348 --> 17:11.484
are under arrest! OTHERS: What?
CALDERÓN: Except those of you

17:11.618 --> 17:16.223
who are to be executed.
KRIEGER: Wait, what? Hey, guys.

17:16.357 --> 17:21.962
Um... CALDERÓN: In which case...
I would not put a lot of money

17:22.096 --> 17:25.799
in my prison canteen account. I'm
looking your way, Mr. Archer.

17:25.934 --> 17:29.369
ARCHER: Wait. Whoa, no. I... MALORY: Well,
then, good luck getting any more weapons,

17:29.504 --> 17:33.807
you-you cut-rate Castro! CALDERÓN: Ha!
I don't need them.

17:33.942 --> 17:40.047
As we speak, my scientists are working on a
secret weapon, and soon I will water our coca

17:40.181 --> 17:43.217
fields with the rebels' blood!
(others groan) CHERLENE: Gross!

17:43.351 --> 17:46.220
I can't believe I married you.
(door opens) (others gasp)

17:46.354 --> 17:49.223
COMANDANTE: <i> Presidente.</i> CALDERÓN: Good!
Yes. I am glad you are here.

17:49.357 --> 17:52.226
I have been bluffing the
whole time, look. (clicking)

17:52.360 --> 17:55.229
Totally out of bullets. (chuckles)
See that? ARCHER: My bad, guys.

17:55.363 --> 17:58.265
That's on me. CALDERÓN: Anyway,
okay, now, <i>Comandante,</i> arrest these

17:58.399 --> 18:01.268
people. COMANDANTE: But,<i> Presidente,
</i> the rebels, they have smashed

18:01.402 --> 18:04.771
our counterattack. (others react)
They are headed for the palace.

18:04.906 --> 18:07.774
Hurry! We must get you out of here.
CHERLENE: Wait, and me!

18:07.909 --> 18:10.777
I'm the first lady! COMANDANTE: Please,
hurry. We have to go before...

18:10.912 --> 18:14.348
(loud crash) (all gasp)
(engine rumbling)

18:14.482 --> 18:17.417
CALDERÓN: W-Well? Don't just
stand there, you cowards!

18:17.552 --> 18:21.188
Do something! (weapons clatter) Oh, really?
That-that is

18:21.322 --> 18:24.191
obviously not what I... COMANDANTE:
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

18:24.325 --> 18:29.062
We surrender! (engine shuts
off) CYRIL: Uh, what's that?

18:29.197 --> 18:32.099
PAM: Cyril? CYRIL: Yeah, I couldn't
hear you over the sound of this

18:32.233 --> 18:35.869
gigantic friggin' tank. (chuckles)
MALORY: You idiot, that's the

18:36.004 --> 18:40.207
vehicle you found? I meant a limousine
or... CYRIL: Jesus God, woman,

18:40.341 --> 18:43.777
nothing is ever good enough for you!
ARCHER: Right?

18:43.912 --> 18:46.980
COMANDANTE: Please, sir! Accept our
surrender! CALDERÓN: No, not to him!

18:47.115 --> 18:50.884
(groans) He's not the rebels! LANA:
Kind of a moot point, though, isn't it?

18:51.019 --> 18:54.187
What with the tank and all. CYRIL: Yeah.
So I hereby... ARCHER: Accept your

18:54.322 --> 18:57.257
surrender! Dibs! I'm in charge!
Cyril, get out of the...

18:57.392 --> 19:03.330
(whirring) CYRIL: Sorry? I
still couldn't hear you.

19:03.464 --> 19:07.134
(others laugh) ARCHER: Yeah, Cyril,
you are sorry because you still look

19:07.268 --> 19:12.973
like an idiot. You look like, uh...
(laughing): Oh, my God.

19:13.107 --> 19:16.376
Hang on. Wait, wait, wait. I-I
actually have something for this!

19:16.511 --> 19:21.815
(inhales deeply) Mi... PAM: Mike
Ducockless! (all laugh but Archer)

19:28.056 --> 19:30.202
Oh, boy. (Archer
roaring) Ha, ha!
