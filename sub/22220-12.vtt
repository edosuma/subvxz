WEBVTT

00:20.062 --> 00:22.053
Hey...

00:22.148 --> 00:24.013
Baby, Alex, what's wrong?

00:25.234 --> 00:26.974
(sighs)

00:29.071 --> 00:31.278
I'm taking the Stanford job.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.328
Stanford.

00:40.291 --> 00:45.661
You know, there are other
medical research programs.

00:45.755 --> 00:49.543
Not with full grant
scholarships.

00:49.634 --> 00:53.547
Well, I've got a shot at the
space program here.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.219
I know.

00:56.307 --> 00:59.595
We've talked about this, John.
Taking a break.

00:59.685 --> 01:05.225
It's not a break, Alex, if
you're all the way across
the continent.

01:09.362 --> 01:12.274
I know it may not seem
like it now, but...

01:14.283 --> 01:16.899
I'll always be there for you.

01:33.261 --> 01:36.298
Well, if we're meant to be
together, we'll be together.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.982
I love you.

01:47.817 --> 01:49.227
I love you.

01:52.822 --> 01:54.778
( loud explosion )

02:14.427 --> 02:15.257
D'argo:
Pilot!

02:15.344 --> 02:18.177
Pilot:
I have no answers as yet.

02:18.264 --> 02:19.925
A little long for a starburst,
don't you think?

02:20.016 --> 02:22.257
Hail Prince of the Obvious.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.811
About time.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.183
Now explain yourself.

02:29.275 --> 02:33.314
Pilot:
I told you, I did not
initiate starburst,

02:33.404 --> 02:34.985
nor did I terminate it.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.357
Then who did?

02:36.449 --> 02:38.314
Moya.

02:38.409 --> 02:40.695
She thought she heard the
distress cry of another
pregnant Leviathan

02:40.786 --> 02:42.993
and was attempting to
locate the source.

02:43.080 --> 02:46.698
I like my wives pregnant and
my ships cold to the touch.

02:46.792 --> 02:51.126
That way, my feet stay warm and
my slumber is uninterrupted.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.623
"Wives," plural?

02:52.715 --> 02:54.251
Big fella.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.583
l was just dreaming about my
final mating session

02:56.677 --> 03:00.716
when our gestating goliath
decided she needed some
exercise.

03:00.806 --> 03:03.468
That's my underwear.

03:03.559 --> 03:05.140
What does this say?

03:05.227 --> 03:06.637
Calvin.

03:06.729 --> 03:08.014
Then they're not yours.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.185
D'argo:
This is strange.

03:09.273 --> 03:12.185
I dreamt of my wife last night.

03:12.276 --> 03:15.860
About the last night we spent
together before she
was murdered.

03:16.781 --> 03:18.612
That was my dream.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.236
No, no, no.
Not... not your wife.

03:21.327 --> 03:23.283
Someone I cared about.

03:24.372 --> 03:25.407
What about you girls?

03:25.498 --> 03:27.489
Sex dreams?

03:27.583 --> 03:28.663
I sleep soundly.

03:28.751 --> 03:31.493
lam unimpressed by your
masculine reveries.

03:31.587 --> 03:33.873
Pilot, has Moya found the ship
she's looking for?

03:33.964 --> 03:37.127
Yes... and no.

03:37.218 --> 03:39.300
There does not appear to be
another Leviathan,

03:39.387 --> 03:42.049
let alone a pregnant
one in distress.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.221
Then why are we here?

03:44.308 --> 03:45.923
Hmm...

03:46.018 --> 03:48.350
We're receiving a transmission.

03:50.481 --> 03:52.688
Salutations.

03:52.775 --> 03:56.643
I apologize for the deceit but
there was no other way

03:56.737 --> 03:59.399
our signal could reach
across the void.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.230
And we so want to meet you...

04:01.325 --> 04:03.691
Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.209
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

04:14.296 --> 04:17.379
...a radiation wave hit and I
got shot through a wormhole...

04:17.466 --> 04:20.333
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship.

04:20.428 --> 04:23.795
A living ship full of strange
alien life-forms...

04:23.889 --> 04:24.674
Help me...

04:24.765 --> 04:26.221
Listen, please.

04:26.308 --> 04:28.344
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

04:28.436 --> 04:32.270
...being hunted by an insane
military commander...

04:32.356 --> 04:34.722
...doing everything I can...

04:34.817 --> 04:37.229
I'm just looking for
a way home.

05:03.220 --> 05:07.884
Tahleen:
Upon landing, our vessel heats
the rock to molten, then settles below ground.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.966
That's your ship?

05:10.060 --> 05:12.016
Must have been one hell
of an impact.

05:12.104 --> 05:13.685
It's a missionary habitat.

05:13.772 --> 05:15.353
It's clever.

05:15.441 --> 05:18.979
Decreases the likelihood of
an enemy being able to
spot you from space.

05:19.069 --> 05:23.233
It's always instructive how
different cultures view
the same reality.

05:23.324 --> 05:28.990
Where a Peacekeeper sees
defense from attack, we
see solitude for piety.

05:29.079 --> 05:35.370
Pa'u Tahleen, your use of
deception continues to
trouble me.

05:35.461 --> 05:39.204
Tahleen:
Perhaps our many cycles of
reclusion contributed to an error in judgment,

05:39.298 --> 05:43.291
but we could think of no other
way of leading you here.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.341
Let us replenish at the
Altar of Essence.

05:45.429 --> 05:49.593
In the sweet air, you'll soon
forget this world's
toxic surface.

05:51.227 --> 05:54.060
Toxic. That figures.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.440
Welcome to the New Moon
of Delvia,

06:03.531 --> 06:08.571
our modest temple to the
Goddess of Spiritual Renewal.

06:08.661 --> 06:10.276
(whispering ):
You weren't supposed to
bring a weapon.

06:10.371 --> 06:11.907
That's why D'argo stayed
on the ship.

06:11.997 --> 06:14.454
D'argo is young; I am cautious.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.828
I understand your vessel
is low on supplies.

06:16.919 --> 06:19.160
Lorana will show you
to our food source.

06:19.255 --> 06:20.836
Please be greedy.

06:20.923 --> 06:24.086
The more you pick the more
that grows to replaces it.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.377
(whispering ):
It's so perfect, my teeth ache.

06:28.472 --> 06:31.134
Well, that's from all
the sincerity.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.799
Why did you lure us here?

06:33.894 --> 06:35.885
Search yourself, Zhaan.

06:35.980 --> 06:37.766
You know why.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.691
I do not.

06:39.775 --> 06:43.017
What I do know is you invaded
my soul last night

06:43.112 --> 06:45.148
and you left me bitter.

06:45.239 --> 06:48.572
Your friends were happy with
their remembrances,
were they not?

06:48.659 --> 06:51.241
So you caused me to remember.

06:51.328 --> 06:54.070
We always remember, Zhaan.

06:54.164 --> 06:57.201
We simply choose to ignore.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.252
Whoa! There you go.

07:02.339 --> 07:08.130
An "untended renewable" that's
part plant, part animal,
total nutrition.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.211
What's not to like?

07:11.307 --> 07:12.922
This place.

07:13.017 --> 07:14.006
These people.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.557
Their serenity.

07:15.644 --> 07:18.260
Well, at least you've thought
out your position, Aeryn.

07:18.355 --> 07:22.143
Amazes me how people mistake
theosophy for superiority.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.816
You know, I don't think
anything amazes you.

07:26.822 --> 07:28.153
I mean, look at this.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.946
You ever seen one
of these before?

07:30.034 --> 07:31.319
What would you call this?

07:31.410 --> 07:33.901
l dub thee, trigopod.

07:33.996 --> 07:35.782
And, what, you're just no!

07:35.873 --> 07:38.205
No... no reaction from you.

07:39.209 --> 07:42.042
Incredible. How special.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.744
They're a food source, John.

07:43.839 --> 07:46.626
No, Aeryn, it's unique.

07:46.717 --> 07:51.586
It's a squid calamari cucumber,
and it is incredible.

07:52.431 --> 07:53.887
Look up.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.259
Look at this.

07:55.351 --> 07:58.639
This is a ship, Aeryn.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.594
And it's incredible.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.145
It's also a little creepy.

08:02.232 --> 08:04.223
Tahleen:
Look around, Zhaan.

08:04.318 --> 08:09.483
Crichton:
Okay? Almost everything we see,
almost every day is brand new to both of us.

08:10.616 --> 08:13.028
And it's worthy of a response.

08:15.079 --> 08:17.240
On the other hand,
it is a little creepy.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.127
You know our cause is just.

08:26.215 --> 08:28.046
l sympathize, but I cannot
help you.

08:28.133 --> 08:31.421
Then give us the powers
to help ourselves.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.127
When did the madness begin?

08:33.222 --> 08:38.683
Only recently but already,
Pa'u Tuzak is beyond
redemption.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.305
You went too fast, didn't you?

08:40.396 --> 08:43.103
That is why we must have
your secret,

08:43.190 --> 08:45.431
before we are all consumed.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.562
l have no secret, Tahleen.

08:47.653 --> 08:49.735
lam just me.

08:49.822 --> 08:51.562
All that hatred and anger.

08:51.657 --> 08:53.318
You should be insane.

08:53.409 --> 08:54.819
l was insane.

08:54.910 --> 08:58.573
I don't know how I survived
those early cycles.

08:58.664 --> 09:00.200
But you did.

09:00.290 --> 09:05.375
So how does the pious Zhaan
coexist with all that rage?

09:07.589 --> 09:09.375
Share with me.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.207
Save me.

09:13.429 --> 09:15.044
And in return,

09:15.139 --> 09:19.348
I will show you paths to
abilities beyond your
comprehension.

09:31.780 --> 09:34.863
Mom! Mom! Look at the
water snakes!

09:34.950 --> 09:36.656
They're huge!

09:36.744 --> 09:40.202
John, come away from there
before you fall in!

09:55.888 --> 09:59.255
Mom! Help me!

10:00.017 --> 10:03.601
Mom! Mom!

10:03.687 --> 10:04.927
Help! Help!

10:05.022 --> 10:06.262
What? Geez!

10:06.356 --> 10:08.347
What is it?

10:08.442 --> 10:11.229
There's um...

10:11.320 --> 10:13.276
stuff in the water.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.399
lmean, uh...

10:17.451 --> 10:20.067
Miracles of the mind.

10:20.162 --> 10:21.743
You altered his memory.

10:21.830 --> 10:24.287
Help me to understand
your powers

10:24.374 --> 10:27.537
and I'll help you to
understand mine.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.744
Put him back and make
him as he was.

10:44.394 --> 10:50.890
You are the most bizarre
creature l have ever met.

10:59.243 --> 11:00.323
Any word?

11:00.410 --> 11:02.071
Aeryn and Crichton
have close to

11:02.162 --> 11:04.574
a 40-day supply of fresh food
on the transporter already.

11:04.665 --> 11:07.953
Excellent. What's the matter?

11:08.043 --> 11:09.954
Is there food I won't like?

11:10.045 --> 11:12.331
Something Crichton said
is disturbing me.

11:12.422 --> 11:13.286
Finally.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.213
I've been saying that
since he arrived.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.337
It's what he said about us all
having the same dream.

11:18.428 --> 11:19.588
It wasn't the same.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.261
Mine was better than yours.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.213
I sense Delvian trickery
here, Rygel.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.344
We must leave this place.

11:25.435 --> 11:28.097
Get the food first.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.278
Do not touch.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.159
The Sanctity Root.

11:48.250 --> 11:49.740
Poison to your hand.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.700
Death.

11:51.795 --> 11:53.160
Oh... right.

11:53.255 --> 11:55.462
Um... well, thanks.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.164
And you're, um...?

11:57.259 --> 12:01.969
Tuzak: Teacher-Leader-
Holy Reaper-Seeker
of the Flame.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.965
I am here because of you...

12:07.060 --> 12:09.312
Peacekeepeh

12:10.272 --> 12:11.227
I'm not a Peacekeeper.

12:11.315 --> 12:12.680
Yes, you are.

12:16.445 --> 12:18.811
lam insane.

12:18.906 --> 12:21.192
Yeah. That would have been
my next guess.

12:21.283 --> 12:26.198
Insane because of you.

12:26.288 --> 12:31.248
Because I touched inside what I
needed to touch you outside.

12:33.045 --> 12:34.205
Right.

12:36.506 --> 12:39.669
One you travel with
is in peril.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.375
Aeryn? No, Aeryn's not
a Peacekeeper.

12:41.470 --> 12:43.552
Not yours, mine!

12:46.099 --> 12:47.259
Zhaan.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.803
Vigilance, Peacekeeper.

12:54.191 --> 12:56.603
Confusing times.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.361
Do not touch the root.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.332
You are forbidden in
this sanctuary.

13:14.419 --> 13:15.499
l was just looking for the
meditation room.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.043
You also carry a
prohibited weapon.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.291
I appreciate your rules,
but I was allowed to...

13:19.383 --> 13:20.543
A Peacekeeper lie.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.295
l have been driven from my
homeland by your kind.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.593
I will not be driven
from here also.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.092
It is you who must go.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.146
This is wrong, Lorana.

13:37.234 --> 13:38.644
We're far outside our vows.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.067
What choice do we have, Hasko?

13:41.154 --> 13:43.236
That is Tahleen talking,
not you.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.530
Don't be blinded by
her madness.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.903
I pity you, yourjealousy.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.782
Tahleen and | share Unity now,
not you and l.

13:50.872 --> 13:53.079
Accept that and move on.

13:58.088 --> 14:01.251
(group chanting)

14:04.261 --> 14:07.298
Zhaan, | just heard that Aeryn
got booted out of the temple.

14:07.389 --> 14:10.131
Yes. She's already taken a
transport pod. She's gone.

14:10.225 --> 14:12.887
What? Wait a minute.
No, no, she left without us?

14:12.978 --> 14:14.639
No. lwanted herto.

14:14.730 --> 14:17.221
I need you to help me
make a decision.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.522
Look, if you want to stay
here, that's fine.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.395
We can take these people
on Moya.

14:21.486 --> 14:25.354
We have no star charts or
reference points home to Delvia.

14:25.449 --> 14:27.314
We prefer not to wander.

14:27.409 --> 14:28.649
Oh, that makes sense.

14:28.744 --> 14:30.655
Hell, everybody's lost in this
corner of the universe anyway.

14:30.746 --> 14:32.327
John, John.

14:32.414 --> 14:34.780
You asked if I dreamt
the other night.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.115
Idid.

14:36.209 --> 14:40.293
I, too, was reminded of the
last person I ever loved.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.881
Open your mind.

14:41.965 --> 14:44.672
John, you must keep
an open mind.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.716
Are you sure, Zhaan?

14:46.803 --> 14:50.216
His capacity is well below
even a level one.

14:50.307 --> 14:52.764
He will understand.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.099
You must.

14:58.023 --> 14:59.479
Show him.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.316
Show him.

15:13.080 --> 15:17.870
In the fires of Tadesh,

15:17.959 --> 15:21.543
| search for Unity with you,
my companion.

15:21.630 --> 15:25.839
Oh magnificent Zhaan,

15:25.926 --> 15:30.215
Ease the burdens of my flesh
with your soul.

15:30.305 --> 15:33.547
Envelop me.

15:33.642 --> 15:37.430
Release your mind, Bitaal.

15:38.355 --> 15:43.270
Surrender your demons,

15:43.360 --> 15:49.401
for l have others to
replace them.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.241
What are you doing?

15:58.500 --> 16:02.584
Avenging the lives you
have ruined

16:02.671 --> 16:07.381
and the world you put at risk.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.174
No, Zhaan!

16:10.262 --> 16:14.631
Zhaan!

16:15.600 --> 16:18.717
( crying )

16:21.648 --> 16:23.559
What the hell was that?

16:23.650 --> 16:26.437
The crime l was imprisoned for.

16:28.780 --> 16:32.739
You... you...

16:32.826 --> 16:35.363
you killed a guy you were
having sex with.

16:35.453 --> 16:38.581
I admit I have not revealed
all parts of myself to you.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.996
No. No, you haven't!

16:40.083 --> 16:43.120
You killed the guy you were
having sex with, Zhaan!

16:43.211 --> 16:45.827
I need you, John. I need you.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.662
For what? Target practice?!

16:47.757 --> 16:49.543
I am adrift.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.090
As the past is sweeping over me

16:51.178 --> 16:54.261
I must rely on the judgment
of someone I trust.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.214
Please understand. Please.

16:58.727 --> 17:01.309
You want me to understand?

17:01.396 --> 17:04.354
Then tell me, why the hell
did you show me that?

17:05.609 --> 17:08.271
Because they want me
to do it again.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.523
Bitaar was our spiritual
counselor, John.

17:14.618 --> 17:16.483
He was a very powerful man.

17:16.578 --> 17:21.038
l was studying with him at the
time and things just
took their course.

17:21.124 --> 17:22.955
Why did you kill him, Zhaan?

17:23.043 --> 17:24.032
His tenure was up.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.867
Instead of yielding control,

17:25.962 --> 17:31.002
he and the other conservative
Pa'us hired the Peacekeepers
for external security.

17:31.092 --> 17:33.629
Our world changed forever.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.881
Delvian coup d'etat.

17:35.972 --> 17:38.384
I didn't think you people
had it in you.

17:38.475 --> 17:43.890
Peacekeepers rounded up all
the liberal thinkers and
voices of protest.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.972
My own father was sent to an
asteroid camp.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.682
He may still be there
for all I know.

17:48.777 --> 17:52.361
Was that before or after
you killed Bitaar?

17:53.573 --> 17:55.484
I loved Bitaar, John.

17:58.119 --> 18:00.326
And these people...

18:00.413 --> 18:02.665
Tahleen and the others, they
want you to kill again?

18:02.749 --> 18:05.081
Not by my own hand.

18:05.168 --> 18:07.750
They want me to help them
regain power.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.328
And so-so... so what are
you supposed to do?

18:10.423 --> 18:12.709
Serve as poster child for
the revolution?

18:14.552 --> 18:16.964
As we train for purity,

18:17.055 --> 18:20.718
Delvians often become vulnerable
to their own dark impulses.

18:20.809 --> 18:24.802
Should it surface, they succumb
as if to an infection.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.555
Is that what happened to
Grandpa Loony Tunes?

18:30.193 --> 18:33.401
And now madness is threatening
his followers, too.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.525
But not you.

18:40.495 --> 18:42.486
No, you're as...

18:42.580 --> 18:45.617
twisted as they come...

18:45.709 --> 18:47.916
but you're still sane.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.662
Exactly.

18:51.756 --> 18:54.247
I can help these people, John.

18:54.342 --> 18:55.843
How?

18:55.927 --> 18:57.212
Through Unity.

18:57.304 --> 19:00.467
The sacred surrender of two
minds together.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.468
Two spirits, two souls.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.641
Wait, w... no, just back up.

19:04.728 --> 19:07.310
You're telling me you're going
to give a piece of your mind,

19:07.397 --> 19:11.310
a piece of your soul to
one of these people?

19:11.401 --> 19:15.485
Am ljust being stupid here or
does that sound a little crazy
in its own right, Zhaan?

19:15.572 --> 19:17.779
It is crazy, John.

19:17.866 --> 19:22.200
But where there is risk,
there is also hope.

19:22.287 --> 19:25.279
Look, couldn't it wait until
we've loaded more supplies?

19:25.373 --> 19:26.613
This trigopod is mythic.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.494
Oh! You say it's part vegetable!

19:28.585 --> 19:30.200
Anymore from Crichton?

19:30.295 --> 19:33.537
He says they want Zhaan to
participate in some sort
of ceremonial mating.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.496
This is such a bad combination.
I never should have left them.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.924
Zhaan distracted,
Crichton confused.

19:38.011 --> 19:42.129
Crichton is always confused.

19:42.223 --> 19:44.805
Pilot, prepare the transport
pod. We're heading back
to the planet.

19:44.893 --> 19:46.429
Very well.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.850
Oh, wait for me!

19:47.937 --> 19:50.189
If we spent another thousand
cycles here,

19:50.273 --> 19:52.935
we couldn't find the strength
that that woman can give us
in an instant.

19:53.026 --> 19:56.393
The Peacekeeper has signaled
her intention to return
with the Luxan.

19:56.488 --> 19:58.069
Stop them.

19:58.156 --> 20:01.523
Let nothing distract Zhaan from
what I want her focused on.

20:01.618 --> 20:03.483
The one Crichton is challenging
her with questions.

20:03.578 --> 20:04.738
I can send him back
to his ship.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.990
No, she wants him here.

20:07.082 --> 20:08.822
Their minds are weak.

20:08.917 --> 20:12.284
Preoccupy them all as you
would children.

20:12.379 --> 20:15.542
Attack them with their
own hopes and fears.

20:18.343 --> 20:20.800
Is that how you would treat
your children, Lorana?

20:28.353 --> 20:29.638
So, what's the story?

20:29.729 --> 20:31.310
When do we go?

20:38.780 --> 20:40.395
Who the hell are you?

20:40.490 --> 20:43.232
You don't recognize me?

20:43.326 --> 20:46.989
Oh, I recognize who you're
supposed to be, Alex.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.695
What's wrong with you?

20:48.790 --> 20:50.200
What's wrong with this picture?

20:50.291 --> 20:53.203
Why aren't you in your
lab at Stanford?

20:53.294 --> 20:56.206
I never went to Stanford, John.

20:56.297 --> 20:59.334
I joined the space program
with you. Remember?

21:03.346 --> 21:04.802
Yeah, I...

21:05.807 --> 21:07.718
but, Alex...

21:07.809 --> 21:09.595
how did you get here?

21:09.686 --> 21:11.472
The same way as you.

21:11.563 --> 21:14.805
Or doesn't being your
co-pilot count?

21:16.151 --> 21:18.688
Smile, baby, this is
for my Mom.

21:20.530 --> 21:22.361
Remember now?

21:30.165 --> 21:32.747
(coughing)

21:36.504 --> 21:39.086
Took you long enough.

21:39.174 --> 21:41.460
I had to get up the nerve.

21:41.551 --> 21:44.167
I know who you are.

21:44.262 --> 21:46.344
I know who you are.

21:47.765 --> 21:51.553
I do respect your teachings,
Pa'u Tuzak.

21:51.644 --> 21:55.228
And I respect your choice
of murder victims.

21:58.693 --> 22:00.934
What are you doing here?

22:01.029 --> 22:04.237
The young refuse to
tend the orchard.

22:04.324 --> 22:07.908
Sanctity Roots don't grow
on trees, my dear.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.156
I need your advice.

22:11.247 --> 22:14.080
Uh-uh...

22:14.167 --> 22:18.957
I have tasted of my darker
impulse, so I'm... I'm insane.

22:19.047 --> 22:23.336
What I am contemplating is
also a little insane.

22:23.426 --> 22:25.291
Ah.

22:25.386 --> 22:28.344
Pa'u. Ninth Level?

22:28.431 --> 22:30.296
(dry coughing)

22:30.391 --> 22:37.388
When the darkness rises up from
inside, that is normal.

22:37.482 --> 22:40.315
It's when you reach down
to pull it up...

22:43.446 --> 22:46.028
that the noxious
warnings sound.

22:48.159 --> 22:49.774
Should I give Tahleen
what she wants?

22:49.869 --> 22:51.734
Oh, she would like that.

22:53.248 --> 22:56.411
Will she use the ability I
give her to hurt people?

22:56.501 --> 22:58.241
Certainly.

22:58.336 --> 23:01.828
But she may also free a
planet from tyranny.

23:09.681 --> 23:17.053
( Hasko chanting )

23:24.737 --> 23:27.444
If you hear nothing from us,
come down immediately.

23:27.532 --> 23:30.820
Yes, of course,
my thought exactly.

23:33.371 --> 23:35.236
Aeryn, are you ready?

23:35.331 --> 23:37.162
Ready.

23:44.882 --> 23:46.543
Are you ready?

23:46.634 --> 23:48.966
My pulse rifle just fell apart.

23:50.763 --> 23:53.140
What are you talking about?
Just pick it up.

23:53.224 --> 23:55.761
It's in pieces, D'argo.

23:57.312 --> 23:59.268
I don't know what happened.

24:00.356 --> 24:02.267
What happened is, you...

24:02.358 --> 24:06.476
are wasting... my time.

24:06.571 --> 24:10.405
I don't have any training
to use this bit.

24:15.955 --> 24:21.200
Pilot, are there any Delvian
transmissions coming to Moya?

24:21.836 --> 24:24.077
Boy:
Daddy! Daddy!

24:24.172 --> 24:25.503
Jothee...

24:26.174 --> 24:27.505
Jothee.

24:28.926 --> 24:31.212
Daddy! Help me!

24:31.304 --> 24:33.215
Peacekeepers! Pilot!
Seal all the exits!

24:33.306 --> 24:36.218
There are Peacekeepers
on board!

24:36.309 --> 24:38.550
Rygel, can you help me
with this?

24:39.729 --> 24:46.191
( agonized scream )

24:46.277 --> 24:49.110
What made you decide to
share Unity with me?

24:50.114 --> 24:51.900
The potential.

24:53.117 --> 24:56.280
If you have even the
slightest doubt,

24:56.371 --> 24:58.282
we must refrain.

25:00.583 --> 25:02.995
I will give you what you wish.

25:03.086 --> 25:04.542
What do you need?

25:07.215 --> 25:09.422
The smallest seed.

25:12.053 --> 25:15.090
Point me to the knowledge,

25:15.181 --> 25:18.799
and I will spend my life
mastering it.

25:42.041 --> 25:46.330
Both:
I am yours.

25:48.715 --> 25:51.127
Your spirit is raging.

25:52.468 --> 25:55.676
You strive for so much.

25:55.763 --> 25:58.800
And yours is so calm.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.508
I will show you...

26:02.603 --> 26:04.855
what you want...

26:04.939 --> 26:07.601
so you might...

26:07.692 --> 26:10.399
ease your soul.

26:16.659 --> 26:21.619
(painful whimpering)

26:21.706 --> 26:24.698
What are you doing, Tahleen?

26:24.792 --> 26:27.329
I'm sorry, Zhaan,

26:27.420 --> 26:31.208
but what you have achieved will
take me too long to master
on my own.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.299
No!

26:35.386 --> 26:39.755
Forgive me, Pa'u, but I must
have all of what I need.

26:51.527 --> 26:54.314
You betrayed me.

27:07.794 --> 27:10.080
What's up? What happened?

27:12.256 --> 27:14.542
I made a mistake.

27:17.678 --> 27:19.543
Why-why are your eyes red?

27:21.432 --> 27:24.344
It's tissue bile migrating
to my brain.

27:24.435 --> 27:26.175
( chuckles )

27:27.438 --> 27:28.848
Madness?

27:28.940 --> 27:30.805
Maybe.

27:30.900 --> 27:33.516
My dark impulses are released.

27:33.611 --> 27:36.899
She ripped from me my ability
to control them.

27:38.491 --> 27:40.106
Then go take them back.

27:40.201 --> 27:42.283
It doesn't work like that.

27:42.870 --> 27:44.906
I'd have to start over.

27:44.997 --> 27:50.208
Zhaan, you're in a temple
surrounded by the Goddess.

27:50.294 --> 27:53.536
If you can do it in a
Peacekeeper cell,
you can do it...

27:53.631 --> 28:00.127
I spent nearly 17 cycles
tortured by my own
dark impulses.

28:00.221 --> 28:04.885
Feeling insanity's grip
ebb and flow.

28:04.976 --> 28:07.888
I don't have the strength
to start again!

28:14.527 --> 28:17.394
No, just... just stay put.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.526
Stay put.

28:21.659 --> 28:23.274
We're not done yet.

28:30.293 --> 28:32.375
Crichton:
Tahleen!

28:33.170 --> 28:35.161
Tahleen!

28:37.425 --> 28:39.381
Tahleen!

28:40.303 --> 28:43.010
Alex, where's Tahleen?

28:43.097 --> 28:44.303
Lotus position somewhere.

28:44.390 --> 28:45.721
John, sit down.

28:45.808 --> 28:48.265
She screwed over Zhaan.

28:48.352 --> 28:50.388
That was Zhaan's choice.

28:50.479 --> 28:51.434
Let it go.

28:51.522 --> 28:53.478
No, but you should see her.

28:53.566 --> 28:55.932
And you should see me.

28:56.027 --> 28:59.690
John, we made a promise to
always be there for each other.

29:01.282 --> 29:04.649
Wait, wait, wait. When have I
not been there for you?

29:04.744 --> 29:07.702
Whenever anybody else
needs you.

29:07.788 --> 29:09.198
Alex...

29:09.290 --> 29:12.077
Zhaan is our friend.

29:12.168 --> 29:15.831
Who made a choice to stay
with her own kind.

29:15.922 --> 29:19.414
Accept it.

29:19.508 --> 29:23.376
Do you remember the night that
we made love in the reflecting
pool at Canaveral?

29:24.347 --> 29:26.178
Pilot:
Crichton, are you there?

29:26.265 --> 29:27.846
Yo, Pilot, what's up?

29:27.934 --> 29:31.472
I'm afraid everyone up here is
behaving rather strangely.

29:31.562 --> 29:32.847
D'argo:
Jothee!

29:32.939 --> 29:35.180
Jothee, where are you, boy?

29:37.318 --> 29:41.152
Jothee, where are you?

29:41.238 --> 29:44.071
Pilot, I demand that you
help me find my son.

29:44.158 --> 29:45.364
Now!

29:46.285 --> 29:48.321
I'm sure you heard that.

29:48.412 --> 29:49.572
How's Aeryn?

29:49.664 --> 29:50.744
Just as bad.

29:50.831 --> 29:53.368
( laughing ):
I am not as bad as that.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.165
ljust, um...

29:55.252 --> 29:58.744
I... I can't figure out how
these controls work.

29:58.839 --> 30:01.046
And Rygel is faring no better.

30:01.133 --> 30:04.000
He somehow thinks he has shrunk
to even smaller dimensions.

30:04.095 --> 30:05.756
I'm on it, Pilot.

30:07.890 --> 30:09.972
(sighs)

30:13.813 --> 30:16.771
This is a pretty sacred place,
isn't it?

30:19.235 --> 30:22.819
You think you still
belong here?

30:22.905 --> 30:26.318
Tahleen:
There are over a billion
Delvians living in fear on our home world.

30:26.409 --> 30:28.320
Crichton:
And you're going to
save them, right?

30:28.411 --> 30:29.696
Not alone.

30:29.787 --> 30:32.449
It will take many dedicated
to freedom.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.997
But it serves no end if I
go insane before...

30:35.084 --> 30:38.167
This isn't about freedom.

30:38.254 --> 30:40.165
It's about power.

30:43.592 --> 30:46.299
You know, your friend really
is a remarkable woman.

30:46.387 --> 30:52.257
Whatever you've done to my
friend, you put it right.

30:57.106 --> 30:58.596
Incapacitate him, Lorana.

30:58.691 --> 31:00.227
Even if you have to destroy
his mind.

31:00.317 --> 31:02.399
Why not just let them go?
You already have what you want.

31:02.486 --> 31:04.738
Because I have not.

31:04.822 --> 31:07.359
Zhaan held too tightly
to her secret.

31:07.450 --> 31:10.237
I didn't get enough to
quell the madness.

31:12.204 --> 31:17.324
She will forge another Unity
with Zhaan and most likely kill
her in the process.

31:32.933 --> 31:34.514
Hey!

31:34.602 --> 31:35.808
Where have you been?

31:35.895 --> 31:39.262
Oh! Dealing with Zhaan
and the blue people.

31:39.356 --> 31:40.687
How are we going to get
back on Moya?

31:40.775 --> 31:42.265
I don't know. Look, Alex,
let me ask you a question.

31:42.359 --> 31:45.567
Have you noticed anything
unusual that might indicate

31:45.654 --> 31:48.396
that they've been messing
with our minds?

31:48.491 --> 31:51.278
The only person messing with
my mind, John, is you.

31:51.368 --> 31:54.235
I don't have time for this
right now, okay? I am serious.

31:54.330 --> 31:56.036
And you don't think I am?

31:56.123 --> 32:00.241
When am I going to become more
important to you than Zhaan?

32:01.212 --> 32:02.827
I never gave you that.

32:07.635 --> 32:10.923
Baby, what's wrong?

32:12.139 --> 32:13.549
I'm scared.

32:13.641 --> 32:16.678
Yeah, right, you're scared.

32:17.895 --> 32:19.726
What?

32:19.814 --> 32:23.682
Well, when I agreed to pass on
Stanford and go with you...

32:23.776 --> 32:28.270
What if things don't work out
between us and I'm stuck in
Florida, alone?

32:28.364 --> 32:34.200
You will never, ever be stuck
alone, I promise.

32:34.286 --> 32:38.074
Now how am I going to
hold you to that one?

32:47.049 --> 32:51.713
Alexandra Kimberly O'connor,

32:51.804 --> 32:53.465
marry me.

32:53.556 --> 32:56.047
You never gave me this?

32:57.351 --> 33:01.060
No, I mean, I remember
giving you the ring.

33:01.147 --> 33:03.229
I just don't remember...

33:03.315 --> 33:08.605
And I promise never to place
another before me, till
death do us part.

33:08.696 --> 33:11.153
You don't remember what, John?

33:11.240 --> 33:13.196
Marrying me?

33:13.951 --> 33:15.942
Yeah, of course.

33:16.036 --> 33:17.617
I'm...

33:20.166 --> 33:21.702
Do you want it back?

33:21.792 --> 33:24.829
No! No, no.

33:25.838 --> 33:27.794
Never.

33:27.882 --> 33:30.294
Then honor your vow,

33:30.384 --> 33:33.217
or choose Zhaan over me
and take the ring.

33:57.745 --> 34:00.202
If you return to Delvia,

34:00.289 --> 34:05.249
many may be tempted to seek
your word, barely coherent,
over mine.

34:05.336 --> 34:10.046
Oh, they wouldn't listen to me,
my daughter. You didn't.

34:10.132 --> 34:12.919
On the contrary, all those
cycles growing up...

34:13.010 --> 34:15.877
I listened.

34:15.971 --> 34:20.635
When I brought you all here to
accelerate your teaching,

34:20.726 --> 34:25.891
it was to create a new class
of Pa'u, a better class.

34:25.981 --> 34:28.267
And in your legacy,
we will shine on.

34:28.359 --> 34:31.021
You go too fast.

34:31.111 --> 34:34.899
Pillaging knowledge without
the wisdom to control it.

34:34.990 --> 34:37.732
I mean, learn from my
error, Tahleen.

34:37.826 --> 34:38.906
I have.

34:38.994 --> 34:41.531
Even now, insanity creeps
upon me.

34:41.622 --> 34:46.662
But rather than sit idly by
tending trees that
will not grow,

34:46.752 --> 34:52.713
I take action for myself,
and for my homeland.

34:54.301 --> 34:59.921
What you do is worse than the
insanity you seek to stave off!

35:01.350 --> 35:04.342
You're quite lucid
today, father.

35:11.068 --> 35:12.274
No!

35:13.445 --> 35:16.278
(gasping)

35:35.467 --> 35:37.332
Zhaan.

35:37.428 --> 35:39.009
Come back to Moya with us.

35:39.847 --> 35:42.054
No, Tahleen needs me.

35:42.141 --> 35:44.848
I will be a Pa'u, dedicated
to helping others.

35:44.935 --> 35:46.391
After all she's done?

35:46.478 --> 35:50.062
Yes. lwill join in Unity with
her one more time.

35:51.483 --> 35:54.225
You know, you're full of it.

35:54.320 --> 35:57.983
You're going to kill her,
aren't you? Just like you
did your lover.

35:58.073 --> 36:02.612
You were always the most clever
one on Moya, but I will
not miss you.

36:02.703 --> 36:05.365
Zhaan, just stop.
Stop thinking about Tahleen.

36:05.456 --> 36:08.289
I want you to think about
yourself for a little while.

36:08.375 --> 36:12.584
The urge to give retribution
is intoxicating.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.536
I have missed it.

36:16.342 --> 36:20.051
You know, Alex said that you
were going to do this.

36:20.137 --> 36:21.172
That you'd quit.

36:21.263 --> 36:22.719
Alex?

36:22.806 --> 36:24.182
Who is Alex?

36:24.266 --> 36:25.597
Alex.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.390
My wife.

36:28.312 --> 36:30.974
I should not have brought
you here.

36:31.065 --> 36:32.271
Let's face it.

36:32.358 --> 36:35.270
We have both lost.

36:36.904 --> 36:39.270
( chuckles )

36:39.365 --> 36:41.321
(sighs)

36:58.092 --> 37:00.253
Why do you care for
Zhaan so much?

37:00.344 --> 37:03.051
Huh? What kind of
question is...?

37:04.223 --> 37:07.340
Why is Zhaan so important
to you?

37:07.434 --> 37:11.393
Honey, think of all the times
she's put herself on
the line for us.

37:13.482 --> 37:15.814
You know what?

37:15.901 --> 37:18.313
This is stupid. She likes you.

37:18.404 --> 37:21.237
She can't like me,

37:21.323 --> 37:24.156
because she doesn't
even know me.

37:24.243 --> 37:27.110
What the hell are you
talking about?

37:29.415 --> 37:31.406
I'm not here, John.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.411
I've never been.

37:35.129 --> 37:40.123
Baby, they are messing
with your mind.

37:40.217 --> 37:42.128
You flew with me.

37:42.219 --> 37:45.336
We share quarters on Moya.

37:45.431 --> 37:48.173
Forced memories to
distract you.

37:48.267 --> 37:51.259
You're real.

37:52.271 --> 37:54.136
No.

37:55.691 --> 37:58.148
I love you.

38:08.328 --> 38:12.241
I release you from what
is not true.

38:23.260 --> 38:28.471
How in God's name do you
call yourself a priest?

38:29.349 --> 38:31.476
I have no excuse.

38:31.560 --> 38:32.845
So what now?

38:32.936 --> 38:35.552
Kill me? Cage me?
Teach me tricks?

38:37.858 --> 38:42.147
Your feelings for Zhaan,
I share them, too...

38:42.237 --> 38:45.195
and for you and the others.

38:45.282 --> 38:47.489
We have fallen off the path.

38:47.576 --> 38:50.784
The Sanctity Root around which
our temple revolves

38:50.871 --> 38:54.034
represents purity of thought
and intent.

38:54.124 --> 38:56.866
Your tree...

38:56.960 --> 39:00.123
it's twisted on itself.

39:02.007 --> 39:08.094
Whilst in your mind, you have
showed me the ember of
my own virtue.

39:11.266 --> 39:13.382
Next time, ask.

39:19.274 --> 39:23.734
If you are willing to
take the risk,

39:23.820 --> 39:28.735
you may be able to accomplish
the same result with Zhaan.

39:33.664 --> 39:38.454
Hasko:
I am sorry but you must
focus on this moment.

39:38.544 --> 39:40.535
Your friends' lives hang
in the balance.

39:40.629 --> 39:41.789
I get a vote.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.257
I say we go down and
shoot them all.

39:44.341 --> 39:45.126
Oh!

39:45.217 --> 39:47.208
Look, D'argo almost
stepped on me.

39:47.302 --> 39:51.341
Pilot:
Your eminence you were never
any smaller than your current stature.

39:51.431 --> 39:53.808
Hasko:
You must not invade our temple.

39:53.892 --> 39:57.009
The balance is very delicate.

39:57.104 --> 39:59.220
Please, I have restored
your memories.

39:59.314 --> 40:02.147
Now, allow us to do it our way.

40:02.234 --> 40:04.976
You have two arns.

40:05.070 --> 40:06.571
That's all.

40:15.330 --> 40:18.242
Why do you disturb me as I
prepare for Unity with Zhaan?

40:18.333 --> 40:20.585
Because what you are
doing is wrong.

40:20.669 --> 40:24.332
Such simple analysis from
a vessel I poured much
effort into.

40:24.423 --> 40:26.129
How disappointing.

40:26.216 --> 40:29.458
If you thought so little
why choose Unity with me
in the past?

40:29.553 --> 40:33.011
Because you were too foolish to
look deeper and question me.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.885
You were easy and pleasurable.

40:42.149 --> 40:45.141
Pardon the intrusion, Pa'u,
but I think you should know...

40:45.235 --> 40:49.319
Zhaan and Crichton have fled to
the surface in an attempt to
reach their ship.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.402
Then I must stop them.

41:03.211 --> 41:05.247
Where is she?

41:08.091 --> 41:12.630
The part of Tahleen in
tonight's Unity will be
played by John Crichton.

41:14.389 --> 41:17.506
You wish to share
Unity with me?

41:17.601 --> 41:21.310
Well you guys are always going
on about how hot it is.

41:21.396 --> 41:23.387
I thought I'd give it a go.

41:24.024 --> 41:25.139
This is not sex.

41:25.233 --> 41:27.724
The fusion of our two minds
will surely kill you.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.356
Not if you're careful.

41:31.448 --> 41:33.609
I hear you can protect me...

41:33.700 --> 41:35.156
if you want to.

41:35.243 --> 41:37.780
I see no purpose to this union.

41:37.871 --> 41:41.580
( clucking )

41:43.085 --> 41:45.952
Your translator microbes
handle that one?

41:48.674 --> 41:53.134
Although I must admit,

41:53.220 --> 41:57.054
I have always wondered what
could possibly go in there.

41:57.808 --> 41:59.218
Not a lot.

41:59.309 --> 42:01.220
I'm a guy.

42:02.813 --> 42:04.394
Come on, Zhaan.

42:04.481 --> 42:06.267
What are you afraid of?

42:07.734 --> 42:08.974
(grunts)

42:09.069 --> 42:10.605
Take my head.

42:14.282 --> 42:17.319
Our two spirits will pass
into each other

42:17.411 --> 42:20.448
until we inhabit a single
consciousness.

42:23.417 --> 42:25.248
Too late to be afraid.

42:25.335 --> 42:27.075
Move into me.

42:38.765 --> 42:40.505
Oh, my.

42:41.435 --> 42:42.720
What is that?

42:42.811 --> 42:44.802
Unity.

42:46.273 --> 42:49.936
It's like Disney on acid.

42:50.026 --> 42:55.396
Ten years of really great sex
all at the same moment.

42:55.490 --> 42:56.991
( chuckles softly )

42:58.452 --> 43:00.818
My God, what is that?

43:00.912 --> 43:02.868
What is...

43:02.956 --> 43:05.572
The core of my soul.

43:05.667 --> 43:08.409
The part of me that is
capable of murder.

43:09.463 --> 43:11.169
Wh-what... what's happening?

43:11.256 --> 43:13.497
What... what's happening to me?

43:13.592 --> 43:15.708
Focus on something else, John.

43:15.802 --> 43:19.590
Do not absorb any of my rage.

43:19.681 --> 43:21.387
(whimpers )

43:21.475 --> 43:24.308
All right. All right.

43:25.187 --> 43:26.552
I'm all right.

43:26.646 --> 43:28.352
We must separate now, John.

43:28.440 --> 43:29.976
I don't know how long
I can protect you.

43:30.066 --> 43:33.558
No. There's something in me
that you need to see.

43:33.653 --> 43:35.609
( chuckles )

43:35.697 --> 43:37.437
Look at yourself...

43:37.532 --> 43:39.523
as I see you.

43:40.368 --> 43:41.824
Gentle,

43:41.912 --> 43:44.244
giving.

43:44.331 --> 43:46.413
That's you, Zhaan.

43:47.334 --> 43:51.247
Tahleen can't take that,
and she didn't.

43:52.339 --> 43:54.500
You're still that Pa'u.

43:56.218 --> 43:58.129
Follow me, Zhaan.

43:58.220 --> 44:00.051
See what I see.

44:00.138 --> 44:02.174
Build on that peace.

44:02.265 --> 44:04.722
(gasping softly)

44:04.810 --> 44:07.142
Be her again.

44:07.229 --> 44:08.639
(groaning)

44:12.359 --> 44:14.065
(groaning)

44:17.405 --> 44:19.236
Zhaan?

44:20.367 --> 44:21.777
Zhaan!

44:33.922 --> 44:35.378
Fight it.

44:37.968 --> 44:40.960
Fight all the things that
betray you.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.351
(groaning)

45:01.950 --> 45:03.531
Zhaan.

45:14.588 --> 45:16.954
Thank you, John.

45:46.870 --> 45:49.282
How come...

45:49.372 --> 45:51.078
I can't remember?

45:51.166 --> 45:54.158
The details of another's mind
fade after Unity.

45:54.252 --> 45:57.415
But the essence of
bonding remains.

45:58.298 --> 46:00.209
Tahleen:
Stop!

46:00.300 --> 46:01.915
How dare you!

46:02.010 --> 46:06.219
This tree is the center of
your existence, right?

46:06.306 --> 46:08.297
The source of your goodness?

46:08.391 --> 46:09.847
Spiritual flame?

46:09.935 --> 46:11.471
Well, burn down the
temple sister,

46:11.561 --> 46:14.428
just 'cause you're a bastard
sect in any religion.

46:14.522 --> 46:17.434
I will destroy your
useless mind!

46:27.702 --> 46:29.317
How did you block him from me?

46:29.412 --> 46:33.030
Unity also gifted me with
a part of you, Tahleen.

46:33.124 --> 46:36.662
I am now a Pa'u of the Tenth
Level, able to protect.

46:43.343 --> 46:46.801
(rumbling)

47:00.235 --> 47:02.897
We want the same things, Zhaan.

47:02.988 --> 47:04.273
No, we don't.

47:04.364 --> 47:07.197
You reach for the dark impulses
I leave behind.

47:07.283 --> 47:09.194
We all visit the precipice.

47:09.285 --> 47:12.152
Each one of us must find
our own way down.

47:12.247 --> 47:17.162
With your father gone, he
will need you to tend
to his orchard.

47:24.801 --> 47:26.291
(drops ax)

47:39.274 --> 47:41.139
It's okay.

48:13.892 --> 48:16.053
Crichton:
What are you doing?

48:17.937 --> 48:20.349
The vestments of a Pa'u.

48:20.440 --> 48:23.682
Feels like a shroud.
I'm no longer worthy.

48:25.820 --> 48:27.902
You do that and she wins.

48:31.326 --> 48:33.738
It's not about winning, John.

48:33.828 --> 48:37.787
Each day infuses us with
a knowledge we carry
into tomorrow.

48:40.502 --> 48:43.244
I will be a Pa'u again,

48:43.338 --> 48:45.249
but I'm not today.

48:46.216 --> 48:48.081
Seems a shame.

48:49.302 --> 48:51.509
Waste all those years of
training.

48:55.058 --> 48:57.344
Hardly wasted.

48:57.435 --> 49:00.427
They were the best cycles
of my life.
