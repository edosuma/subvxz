11:47.794 --> 11:49.404
any foreign military presence
on their island.

11:49.447 --> 11:51.406
I saw a protest or two.
Separatists feel like

11:51.449 --> 11:53.408
the rest of Japan treats them
like second-class citizens,

11:53.451 --> 11:55.062
so they want to govern
themselves, but...

11:55.105 --> 11:56.890
I never heard of the movement
getting violent, though.

11:56.933 --> 11:59.588
Looks like Tomo was born here.
He's an American.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.111
Why was he so
passionate about this?

12:01.155 --> 12:02.896
HONDO:
And what's his connection
to Jamie Carawan?

12:02.939 --> 12:05.681
She meets up with a guy,
Tomo picks him up in his car,

12:05.725 --> 12:07.117
and then she ends up
shooting at 'em.

12:07.161 --> 12:09.032
Captain, Sergeants,

12:09.076 --> 12:10.773
this is Agent Trask,
FBI counterterrorism.

12:10.817 --> 12:13.341
She has intel on the man
we took down

12:13.384 --> 12:15.865
this morning and
his associates.Elle.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.388
Hondo.

12:17.432 --> 12:18.781
You know each other?

12:18.825 --> 12:20.261
It's been a long time.

12:20.304 --> 12:21.784
Almost 15 years.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.612
Good to see
you again.

12:23.655 --> 12:24.918
It's good to see you.

12:24.961 --> 12:26.571
JESSICA:
Counterterrorism?

12:26.615 --> 12:29.313
So this isabout
the separatist movement?

12:29.357 --> 12:31.838
Not the Okinawan separatist
movement as a whole so much

12:31.881 --> 12:33.709
as one man: Kaito Nakama.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.667
He's a zealot, he's charismatic,

12:35.711 --> 12:37.974
he's rich. He was at
that café this morning

12:38.018 --> 12:39.889
to meet with an
employee of Ketter Labs,

12:39.933 --> 12:40.977
a government contractor.

12:41.021 --> 12:42.674
Yeah, Jamie Carawan.
We met with her,

12:42.718 --> 12:44.720
but she lawyered up.
She seemed pretty scared.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.330
We should all be scared.

12:46.374 --> 12:48.593
She sold Kaito a canister
of weapons-grade plutonium.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.726
He's planning
to use it in a bomb.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.336
Wait a minute. The kid
that we took down this morning

12:52.380 --> 12:53.860
was trying to build a nuke?

12:53.903 --> 12:55.818
He was one of Kaito's men, yes.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.472
I have an asset

12:57.515 --> 12:59.822
undercover
inside Kaito's organization.

12:59.866 --> 13:02.477
He's a believer in the cause
of Okinawan separatism,

13:02.520 --> 13:04.305
but not Kaito's tactics.

13:04.348 --> 13:05.872
According to my asset,

13:05.915 --> 13:08.613
the buy this morning was enough
to complete the bomb.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.615
Wait. If you already have
someone on the inside,

13:10.659 --> 13:12.443
then why haven't you
taken this guy down?

13:12.487 --> 13:14.445
The stolen plutonium was
stored in various places,

13:14.489 --> 13:17.100
and only Kaito knew the
exact location, until today,

13:17.144 --> 13:18.798
when his people
brought every ounce

13:18.841 --> 13:20.843
of his plutonium
right here to L.A.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.236
We believe that they are going

13:22.279 --> 13:23.977
to try and smuggle it back
to Okinawa

13:24.020 --> 13:25.717
tomorrow morning by boat.JESSICA:
Why smuggle it out?

13:25.761 --> 13:26.806
What's the target?

13:26.849 --> 13:28.851
The bases.
They want

13:28.895 --> 13:31.288
to bomb one of our military
sites on Okinawa. There are

13:31.332 --> 13:33.464
thousands of servicemen
and women on those bases.

13:33.508 --> 13:35.423
I still got friends over there.The good news

13:35.466 --> 13:38.426
is Kaito doesn't have
a nuclear detonation device yet.

13:38.469 --> 13:40.645
And how close is he
to getting one of those?Well, that's what the rest

13:40.689 --> 13:42.430
of my team is out there
trying to prevent.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.736
If your team can help me
get Kaito and the plutonium,

13:44.780 --> 13:46.303
then it won't even matter.

13:46.347 --> 13:48.262
When willyou have a
location on the plutonium?

13:48.305 --> 13:50.003
My asset could message
me at any moment.

13:50.046 --> 13:52.266
I'll get my team tac'd up.In the meantime,

13:52.309 --> 13:54.442
is there an office
that I can use?

13:54.485 --> 13:55.399
Of course. This way.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.406
DEACON:
How long

14:02.450 --> 14:04.321
you work with
Agent Trask?

14:04.365 --> 14:06.628
I didn't. We dated
for a few months.

14:06.671 --> 14:08.586
She was with the Bureau's

14:08.630 --> 14:10.850
financial crimes division
here in L.A.

14:10.893 --> 14:13.896
She saw a chance for a promotion
if she transferred to D.C.,

14:13.940 --> 14:15.898
and she took it.Try the long-distance thing?

14:15.942 --> 14:18.379
Yeah, we tried. Could have
tried harder, I guess, but...

14:18.422 --> 14:20.381
That woman had
a lot going for her.

14:20.424 --> 14:21.948
Well, maybe it's
not too late.

14:21.991 --> 14:23.906
Deac, trust me,
I'm pretty sure it is.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.039
I didn't end things
the best way.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.302
Broke up with her
over text.
Seriously?

14:28.345 --> 14:30.130
I was young and dumb, Deac.

14:30.173 --> 14:32.132
15 years ago, you
weren't that young.

14:32.175 --> 14:34.177
Okay, easy, easy, tough guy.
You can laugh all you want,

14:34.221 --> 14:36.397
but I ain't got a shred of gray
going on here, silver dude.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.661
All right, you stop shaving that
head for a week, get back to me.

14:39.704 --> 14:41.271
Hey, Deac, what about
this Friday for the baby shower?

14:41.315 --> 14:43.143
We got that training thing.
We'll be done by lunch.

14:43.186 --> 14:45.841
Then Annie can come down, and
we can do what we did last time.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.061
Our last baby shower was,
what, a year and a half ago?

14:48.104 --> 14:50.063
I don't want to be that person
who's constantly expecting gifts

14:50.106 --> 14:52.065
from his coworkers just
'cause he and his wife

14:52.108 --> 14:53.327
can't stop procreating.

14:53.370 --> 14:55.155
Aw. No one feels like that.
Right, guys?

14:55.198 --> 14:56.504
I feel like that.

14:57.940 --> 15:00.334
Besides, we still have
Lila's old clothes.

15:00.377 --> 15:02.727
We really don't
need anything new.TAN: Yes!

15:02.771 --> 15:04.381
What, Rocker win?Rocker won boxing.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.383
LAPD's up two to one
over the fire department.

15:06.427 --> 15:07.776
Yeah!
Boom!

15:07.819 --> 15:09.604
I told him Delgado
telegraphs those punches.

15:11.562 --> 15:14.043
Wait, wait, wait.
Seriously?

15:14.087 --> 15:16.872
Look what, look what
Marcus King just posted.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.439
Oh, you got
to be kidding."LAPD injury woes?"

15:18.482 --> 15:20.354
"Couldn't help but notice
the wrap

15:20.397 --> 15:23.096
on Dominique Luca's wrist.
Hope he's good to go tonight."

15:23.139 --> 15:24.488
We just won boxing.

15:24.532 --> 15:26.142
Guy can't even let us enjoy it
for a second.

15:26.186 --> 15:27.578
Oh, people are
already commenting.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.798
You know, this guy might
be a ringer, but...

15:29.841 --> 15:31.582
he's got this social
media stuff down.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.976
Hey. You got this.Yeah, I know.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.804
All right, look,
the fourth event

15:35.847 --> 15:38.285
is powerlifting, and
Luke Keith always wins,

15:38.328 --> 15:39.982
which will tie us
at two-two.

15:40.026 --> 15:42.376
It's gonna come down to you
again, just like last year.

15:42.419 --> 15:43.507
Hey, relax.

15:43.551 --> 15:45.553
I already feel
the zhi zi working.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.338
Zhi zi?

15:48.382 --> 15:50.210
Don't get me
started.

15:50.253 --> 15:51.907
HONDO:
Counterterrorism, huh?

15:51.951 --> 15:55.432
Coming up on my
fifth anniversary.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.173
Are you saying you don't
follow me on LinkedIn?

15:59.959 --> 16:02.613
We really should have
stayed in touch.

16:02.657 --> 16:06.008
Why? So we could promise
to grab a drink

16:06.052 --> 16:08.706
when I'm passing through L.A.,
and then feel guilty when

16:08.750 --> 16:10.447
neither of us
has the time?

16:10.491 --> 16:11.927
Yeah.
Face it.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.843
The careers we
chose don't mix.

16:14.886 --> 16:17.411
What is good here?

16:17.454 --> 16:19.979
Anything except Hicks's
cold brew. He gets real grouchy.

16:23.547 --> 16:25.680
So, how's life
beyond the job?

16:25.723 --> 16:28.030
If there is life
beyond the job for you.

16:28.074 --> 16:29.727
Is there a ring yet?

16:29.771 --> 16:32.078
No, no.

16:32.121 --> 16:34.602
Not yet anyway.
How about you?

16:34.645 --> 16:38.432
Twice. Didn't stick either time.

16:38.475 --> 16:41.652
You glad you made that move
back to D.C.?

16:41.696 --> 16:44.525
Well, I wouldn't be
where I am now if I hadn't.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.528
What about you?

16:47.571 --> 16:49.225
Heading your own SWAT team.

16:49.269 --> 16:51.314
I would never have guessed that.

16:51.358 --> 16:53.055
Not quite sure how
I'm supposed to take that.

16:53.099 --> 16:55.231
Well, you were always
a badass lone wolf like me.

16:55.275 --> 16:56.754
But SWAT
team leader--

16:56.798 --> 16:59.801
that's as much about discipline
and dedication

16:59.844 --> 17:01.498
as it is talent
and instincts.

17:01.542 --> 17:05.807
The Hondo I knew used
to like to live on the edge.

17:05.850 --> 17:08.549
Well, maybe I mellowed out
a little bit.

17:08.592 --> 17:10.855
I hope not too much.

17:17.645 --> 17:20.604
That's my undercover asset.
Location on the plutonium.

17:20.648 --> 17:21.997
Let's go get it.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.528
LAPD SWAT! Runner!

17:32.312 --> 17:33.487
Hey!

17:35.880 --> 17:37.099
Get down!

17:37.143 --> 17:38.709
On the ground!

17:39.580 --> 17:41.190
On your knees!HONDO:
Deac, cover!

17:41.234 --> 17:43.149
Tan, Street, left side!

17:43.192 --> 17:45.238
Luca, Chris, with me!

17:45.281 --> 17:47.805
Give me two!Chris, go right!

17:51.331 --> 17:53.028
Rabbit!

17:58.512 --> 17:59.600
Don't move.

18:01.732 --> 18:03.952
Tan, low!

18:28.629 --> 18:30.718
I know you guys
are true believers,

18:30.761 --> 18:33.808
but like I told your
buddy this morning...

18:33.851 --> 18:35.331
it's not worth it.

18:36.027 --> 18:37.638
Oh, no.

18:38.813 --> 18:40.728
That's not supposed to be there.

18:44.775 --> 18:46.168
There's no
sign of Kaito.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.561
Bad news, Hondo.

18:47.604 --> 18:49.737
There's a cargo tunnel,
runs in all four directions

18:49.780 --> 18:51.173
for blocks
under all these warehouses.

18:51.217 --> 18:52.827
Must be how Kaito escaped.

18:52.870 --> 18:54.916
There was no cargo tunnel
on the blueprints.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.222
We would have had
a plan for that.

18:56.265 --> 18:57.788
Hondo, there's nothing in here.

18:57.832 --> 18:59.834
Plutonium's gone.

19:01.879 --> 19:04.099
ELLE:
Tanaka's a trusted asset.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.710
He would never let Kaito
get away with the plutonium.

19:06.754 --> 19:10.279
The fact is, he did,
and he escaped with Kaito.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.238
I haven't heard from Tanaka
since before the raid.

19:12.281 --> 19:14.153
Maybe Kaito's on to him,
holding him at gunpoint.

19:14.196 --> 19:15.676
There's more, Elle.

19:15.719 --> 19:16.807
The blueprints you gave us

19:16.851 --> 19:18.157
didn't have that cargo tunnel
on 'em.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.810
But when I got the
blueprints myself,

19:19.854 --> 19:22.335
directly from the city,
it's right there.HONDO: Which means

19:22.378 --> 19:25.120
the blueprints you gave us were
altered. Now, either someone

19:25.164 --> 19:27.731
in your office changed them
before they got to you,

19:27.775 --> 19:29.603
or you purposely
gave us faulty intel.

19:31.082 --> 19:32.736
It wasn't supposed
to happen this way.

19:35.696 --> 19:37.654
Look, you're right.

19:37.698 --> 19:40.135
I changed the blueprints
so that Kaito could escape,

19:40.179 --> 19:42.833
but they were not supposed to
get away with the plutonium.

19:42.877 --> 19:45.706
I can't say more without
my boss's consent.

19:45.749 --> 19:47.751
Get your boss on the phone then.

19:47.795 --> 19:49.753
Well...

19:52.191 --> 19:54.976
No need. He's downstairs.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.160
I'm sure you
and your people are eager

20:05.204 --> 20:06.814
for an explanation,
Commander.

20:06.857 --> 20:08.207
Why your agent intentionally
helped the target

20:08.250 --> 20:09.860
of today's raid escape
with enough plutonium

20:09.904 --> 20:12.733
to blow up the city?
I'd love one.

20:12.776 --> 20:14.909
When my asset,
Tanaka, contacted me

20:14.952 --> 20:17.694
to give me the location of
the warehouse, he also told me

20:17.738 --> 20:20.349
that Kaito now has
a nuclear detonation device.

20:20.393 --> 20:23.396
An old SADM that's been
retrofitted for plutonium.

20:23.439 --> 20:26.573
It's uniquely portable,
fits in a duffel bag.

20:26.616 --> 20:28.749
Agent Trask informed me
of this, and I instructed her

20:28.792 --> 20:30.925
to carry on with the raid,
get the plutonium,

20:30.968 --> 20:32.883
but make sure Kaito
and her asset escaped.

20:32.927 --> 20:35.756
You're hoping Kaito leads
your man Tanaka to the device.

20:35.799 --> 20:37.366
Exactly.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.673
You should have told us
what was really going down.

20:39.716 --> 20:41.327
The raid had to be convincing,

20:41.370 --> 20:43.111
or it could have blown
the asset's cover.

20:43.154 --> 20:44.939
The less people in the know,
the better,

20:44.982 --> 20:46.810
especially when dealing
with personnel like you

20:46.854 --> 20:48.116
who are unaccustomed

20:48.159 --> 20:49.639
to covert ops.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.250
You put our
officers at risk.

20:51.293 --> 20:53.382
How could you be sure Kaito
wouldn't circle around

20:53.426 --> 20:54.731
and start
firing at us?

20:54.775 --> 20:57.473
Straight talk-- your plan
was a complete failure.

20:57.517 --> 20:59.519
Now Kaito's in the wind
with the plutonium

20:59.562 --> 21:01.129
and the means to weaponize it.

21:01.172 --> 21:03.305
Hondo's right. I don't like
the way this went down.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.699
All right? But it's no time to
point fingers. None of us want

21:05.742 --> 21:09.093
to see Kaito detonate a bomb--
here, Japan or anywhere.

21:11.487 --> 21:13.750
So, we're at your disposal.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.491
I've brought my own TAC team,

21:15.535 --> 21:17.841
but we do have these addresses

21:17.885 --> 21:19.321
that need to be
followed up on.

21:19.365 --> 21:21.149
Followed up on?People and places

21:21.192 --> 21:22.846
Kaito or his known associates
have visited

21:22.890 --> 21:25.022
or called to
over the last few years.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.328
We checked them out
in recent weeks,

21:26.372 --> 21:28.112
but couldn't hurt
for you to go over them again.

21:29.157 --> 21:30.550
Never know.

21:30.593 --> 21:32.726
There might be something
we missed.

21:32.769 --> 21:35.468
I see. Well...

21:35.511 --> 21:38.166
let us know if you come up
with anything more pertinent.

21:38.209 --> 21:39.907
Don't worry,
I brought my A-team.

21:39.950 --> 21:42.953
Okay.We've got the situation
under control.

21:45.956 --> 21:47.654
Hey, Hondo.

21:47.697 --> 21:48.785
Look, I'm sorry.

21:48.829 --> 21:50.178
I was just doing my job.

21:50.221 --> 21:51.962
You could have told me.I wanted to.

21:52.006 --> 21:53.747
15 years ago I would have.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.226
But the person you are now,

21:55.270 --> 21:57.185
I didn't think you'd
go along with the plan.

21:57.228 --> 21:59.666
And maybe you're right.
But maybe we could have

21:59.709 --> 22:01.058
come up with something together
that didn't end

22:01.102 --> 22:02.886
in us losing the plutonium.

22:05.715 --> 22:07.761
You got to be kidding me.The A-team?

22:07.804 --> 22:09.589
What does that make us,
the B-team?Yeah.

22:09.632 --> 22:11.373
There's got to be someone else
who can do these follow-ups,

22:11.417 --> 22:12.766
right?Chris is right.

22:12.809 --> 22:13.984
We can assign patrol officers

22:14.028 --> 22:15.769
to follow up on
these addresses,

22:15.812 --> 22:17.379
but what do you suggest
we do in the meantime?

22:17.423 --> 22:18.859
What about that woman, Jamie,

22:18.902 --> 22:20.687
the one who sold them
the plutonium?

22:20.730 --> 22:22.645
Or the guys we took
down at the warehouse?

22:22.689 --> 22:24.386
Nobody's talking.CHRIS: Tomo.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.606
The guy from the record store.He's kind of dead.

22:26.649 --> 22:28.782
I know, but he's got
his family in town, right?

22:28.825 --> 22:30.000
He was young.

22:30.044 --> 22:31.915
He might've been sloppy,
let something slip.

22:31.959 --> 22:33.395
FBI already talked to them.HONDO: Yeah, they probably

22:33.439 --> 22:35.266
kicked in their door
and tore their house apart.

22:35.310 --> 22:37.704
Phillips doesn't seem
like much of a people person.Yeah, right after

22:37.747 --> 22:39.401
they found out their son
was a wannabe terrorist.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.011
I doubt they're
in any mood to talk.

22:41.055 --> 22:42.317
JESSICA:
It's a good idea, Chris.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.579
I'll talk to them personally.

22:43.623 --> 22:45.059
You stay with me.All right.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.365
The rest of us will
talk to his coworkers.

22:46.408 --> 22:47.801
DEACON:
I'll catch up.

22:47.844 --> 22:49.324
My rifle's in the armory
getting the sight adjusted.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.847
Hey, Deac.

22:50.891 --> 22:53.328
Yeah?It's about the baby shower.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.939
Appreciate the thought, Chris,
but like I said, we're good.

22:55.983 --> 22:58.333
Okay, it doesn't
have to be a big thing.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.814
It could just be an after-work
beer when we're not on call.

23:00.857 --> 23:02.903
Chris, you seem to be
100% more invested

23:02.946 --> 23:04.121
in this baby shower
than Annie and I,

23:04.165 --> 23:05.906
and we're the ones
having a baby.

23:05.949 --> 23:07.864
Okay, but there's just no reason
this new kid shouldn't have

23:07.908 --> 23:09.518
all the same perks
the others got.

23:09.562 --> 23:11.128
She's not gonna care if we have
a baby shower for her.

23:11.172 --> 23:13.130
She won't even be aware of it.She will.

23:13.174 --> 23:15.350
I-I grew up in a household
with four cousins,

23:15.394 --> 23:16.569
and I was the youngest.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.222
That stuff that Street said

23:18.266 --> 23:19.833
this morning about
the youngest kids

23:19.876 --> 23:21.965
getting the short end of the
stick? That's a real thing.

23:22.009 --> 23:23.532
Yeah, but I bet

23:23.576 --> 23:25.447
you got spoiled later on.
See, it all evens out.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.971
Mm, no. I didn't have clothes
that weren't hand-me-downs

23:28.015 --> 23:29.190
until I could buy them myself.

23:29.233 --> 23:30.974
I'd be flipping
through photo albums,

23:31.018 --> 23:32.802
and I would see these
huge-ass birthday parties

23:32.846 --> 23:34.195
the others got when
they turned one.

23:34.238 --> 23:36.980
Flip to mine? A bran muffin
with a candle in it.

23:37.024 --> 23:40.027
Your new daughter's gonna
want to feel like you were

23:40.070 --> 23:41.594
as excited about her
coming into this world

23:41.637 --> 23:43.160
as you were about the others.

23:43.204 --> 23:45.467
All right, I hear you.

23:45.511 --> 23:48.470
I'll talk to Annie about it.Yes.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.649
LAFD just tied it
up, by the way.

23:53.693 --> 23:56.043
I told you, Luke Keith
always wins powerlifting.

23:56.086 --> 23:57.087
It's up to you, big guy.

23:57.131 --> 23:59.002
Yeah.

23:59.046 --> 24:00.482
Hey, guys.

24:00.526 --> 24:02.092
Go ahead. I'll catch
up in the Charger.

24:02.136 --> 24:04.791
Something I want to check out.All right, got it.

24:13.669 --> 24:16.672
Elle. Elle.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.460
Are you okay?You really care?

24:21.503 --> 24:23.462
After I lied to you
the way I did?

24:23.505 --> 24:25.507
I should have trusted you.

24:25.551 --> 24:27.901
I do care. But I also know
there's a nuke in the wind,

24:27.944 --> 24:29.032
and whatever's bothering you

24:29.076 --> 24:30.338
probably has something
to do with that.

24:30.381 --> 24:33.123
We lost contact with Tanaka.

24:33.167 --> 24:37.127
We use a hidden app
on his phone to communicate,

24:37.171 --> 24:38.955
and we found his phone
and another one--

24:38.999 --> 24:40.391
Kaito's, probably--

24:40.435 --> 24:42.524
broken to pieces
not far from the warehouse.

24:42.568 --> 24:45.048
Now we have no way to track him
to the detonation device.

24:45.092 --> 24:47.486
He could still call you.
Contact you some other way.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.139
Although he hasn't.

24:49.183 --> 24:51.968
Procedure is
he checks in right away

24:52.012 --> 24:53.230
when something
like this happens

24:53.274 --> 24:54.580
so that I know he's okay.

24:54.623 --> 24:56.233
Nothing.

24:56.277 --> 24:58.018
And let me guess. Your boss is
working under the assumption

24:58.061 --> 25:00.107
that Tanaka's dead, but
you're not ready to do that.

25:00.150 --> 25:01.543
He's using
all of our resources

25:01.587 --> 25:03.632
to pursue other avenues.All right.

25:03.676 --> 25:05.068
So, what's your idea?

25:05.112 --> 25:06.635
Hey.

25:06.679 --> 25:08.681
Just because I wouldn't go
along with your wild-ass plan

25:08.724 --> 25:10.509
like I might've back
in the day doesn't mean

25:10.552 --> 25:12.075
I'm not willing to take
the right kind of risk.

25:12.119 --> 25:14.991
I set up a redundancy
for Tanaka and myself

25:15.035 --> 25:17.080
in case a situation
like this happened.

25:17.124 --> 25:19.474
A physical
message drop location.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.041
And I still think
he's our best bet.

25:22.085 --> 25:24.000
I'll drive.

25:24.044 --> 25:26.873
WOMAN: They took everything
from Tomo's room.

25:26.916 --> 25:28.831
Photos.

25:28.875 --> 25:31.965
Things we can never replace.

25:32.008 --> 25:36.099
But the worst thing is they
won't let us have his body.

25:36.143 --> 25:38.014
Or even see it.

25:38.058 --> 25:41.104
I can't even imagine
how difficult this is for you,

25:41.148 --> 25:43.106
but they will let you bury him
after the investigation.

25:44.281 --> 25:46.283
Kenta.

25:49.199 --> 25:50.331
JESSICA:
Mr. and Mrs. Yara, do you know

25:50.374 --> 25:52.420
what he and his friends
were planning?

25:53.464 --> 25:55.075
Tomo was angry

25:55.118 --> 25:57.512
ever since he was a teenager.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.775
He wished

25:59.819 --> 26:01.951
that we had raised
him in Japan.

26:01.995 --> 26:03.605
He was born here,

26:03.649 --> 26:07.435
but he felt that he
belonged over there.

26:07.478 --> 26:09.437
I didn't understand.

26:09.480 --> 26:10.917
JESSICA:
My parents

26:10.960 --> 26:12.353
came here from Mexico

26:12.396 --> 26:14.747
when my sisters and I
were young.

26:14.790 --> 26:18.402
I know it was a challenge
raising us in a new country.

26:18.446 --> 26:21.884
We gave him
everything he wanted.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.932
Kenta, right?

26:25.975 --> 26:27.847
What do you think?

26:27.890 --> 26:31.067
Why'd your, uh, brother
get hooked up with these people?

26:32.112 --> 26:34.027
Because they gave
him something

26:34.070 --> 26:35.028
he didn't get here.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.812
They believe in something.

26:36.856 --> 26:39.249
They gave him a purpose.

26:39.293 --> 26:41.469
Just because we're Americans,
we're supposed to ignore

26:41.512 --> 26:44.124
what's happening to
the rest of our family?

26:44.167 --> 26:45.865
What is he talking about?

26:49.172 --> 26:52.959
A few years ago,
our cousin got raped

26:53.002 --> 26:55.657
by a private contractor working
on a U.S. base.

26:57.703 --> 26:58.965
You haven't heard
about it, though,

26:59.008 --> 27:00.967
because everyone
covered it up.

27:01.010 --> 27:02.098
The U.S. military,

27:02.142 --> 27:04.579
the Japanese government.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.886
They didn't want
another scandal.

27:06.929 --> 27:08.496
They just wrote her family
a check,

27:08.539 --> 27:10.541
and the guy didn't even go
to jail.

27:12.543 --> 27:15.503
She's never been the same.

27:15.546 --> 27:19.507
She was, like... 16.

27:19.550 --> 27:22.292
She and, uh, Tomo were close?

27:23.729 --> 27:25.687
Least Tomo was trying

27:25.731 --> 27:28.255
to do something instead of
pretending everything's fine

27:28.298 --> 27:29.343
and nothing happened.

27:30.953 --> 27:32.563
Hey.

27:32.607 --> 27:34.914
I can tell you look up
to your brother.

27:36.959 --> 27:39.396
But Tomo was planning
to help murder

27:39.440 --> 27:41.921
a lot of people
that had nothing to do

27:41.964 --> 27:43.923
with what happened
to your cousin.

27:45.402 --> 27:49.972
Sounds to me like you guys
talked a lot about this stuff.

27:50.016 --> 27:53.323
If there's anything
you can tell us to help us,

27:53.367 --> 27:55.108
that's you doing something

27:55.151 --> 27:57.023
instead of pretending
everything's fine.

28:01.288 --> 28:03.246
You said you're a captain?

28:03.290 --> 28:04.204
That's right.

28:04.247 --> 28:06.249
I'll help you.

28:08.034 --> 28:11.037
If you make sure my parents
can see Tomo's body.

28:12.038 --> 28:14.127
I promise.

28:25.791 --> 28:26.835
Our code was numbers-based.

28:26.879 --> 28:28.881
If he was able to get here...

28:31.013 --> 28:32.667
Anything?

28:32.711 --> 28:35.017
No. Nothing.

28:36.018 --> 28:38.238
Elle, this was our place.

28:38.281 --> 28:41.458
I used a restaurant
I'd remember.
Hmm.

28:41.502 --> 28:42.721
Hey, listen,

28:42.764 --> 28:44.113
I don't think I ever
really apologized

28:44.157 --> 28:45.724
for breaking things
off the way I did.

28:46.899 --> 28:48.770
I'm sorry.

28:48.814 --> 28:51.425
"Hate to end things like this,

28:51.468 --> 28:53.819
but I want you to know that
you'll always be special to me."

28:54.950 --> 28:57.213
That's what the text said,
in case you forgot.

28:57.257 --> 28:59.085
I don't remember
it being so lame.

28:59.128 --> 29:01.000
Don't be
too hard on yourself.

29:01.043 --> 29:02.871
Wasn't a surprise.

29:02.915 --> 29:05.004
Never gave me a
second thought, huh?

29:05.047 --> 29:06.745
Well...

29:06.788 --> 29:08.050
It was a long shot
to think that Tanaka

29:08.094 --> 29:09.356
could get here
and leave a message.

29:09.399 --> 29:10.923
All right, so we wait.

29:10.966 --> 29:12.576
Maybe he'll show up later.If he does,

29:12.620 --> 29:13.882
he might not be alone.

29:13.926 --> 29:15.928
Kaito's got to be watching
his guys like a hawk

29:15.971 --> 29:18.060
since the raid.Okay.

29:18.104 --> 29:19.845
So what would he do then?
If he can't get here,

29:19.888 --> 29:21.063
how else could he get
a message to you?

29:21.107 --> 29:22.282
If he had access to a phone,

29:22.325 --> 29:23.849
he would message
or call me directly.

29:23.892 --> 29:26.025
Maybe he does have access.
It's just being monitored.

29:26.068 --> 29:27.766
Okay. Who could he call,
and what could he say

29:27.809 --> 29:28.897
that wouldn't arouse suspicion?

29:29.942 --> 29:31.944
WOMAN:
Good Time Sushi.

29:33.597 --> 29:35.077
He could place an order.

29:42.998 --> 29:44.870
Tanaka.

29:44.913 --> 29:47.829
He use the item numbers
from the menu to relay a code?

29:47.873 --> 29:49.744
That's what I'm hoping.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.920
The code's number-based...

29:51.964 --> 29:54.444
to let me know changes
in Kaito's plans.

29:56.011 --> 29:58.492
They're not leaving
tomorrow morning anymore.

29:58.535 --> 30:01.538
Tanaka's message says,
"Leaving today. 4:30."

30:01.582 --> 30:02.931
That's in less than an hour.

30:06.065 --> 30:07.153
Captain, we just got some intel

30:07.196 --> 30:08.937
that Kaito's leaving
the country today

30:08.981 --> 30:10.417
at 4:30. No idea

30:10.460 --> 30:11.722
which port or what boat, though.

30:11.766 --> 30:13.812
I don't think
Kaito's leaving by boat.

30:13.855 --> 30:15.639
Tomo's brother
gave us I.D.s of people

30:15.683 --> 30:16.989
Tomo was seeing
over the last year.

30:17.032 --> 30:18.860
One of them is a TSA agent

30:18.904 --> 30:20.209
at the Bob Hope
international terminal.

30:20.253 --> 30:21.428
HONDO:
Could one TSA agent

30:21.471 --> 30:22.908
smuggle a bomb onto a plane?

30:22.951 --> 30:25.345
He has full clearance
to the baggage handling area.

30:25.388 --> 30:27.564
This bomb is portable.Yeah, fits into a duffel.

30:27.608 --> 30:29.088
I remember. You got to get
your people to the airport.

30:29.131 --> 30:30.567
I'm on it.JESSICA: If we try to evacuate

30:30.611 --> 30:32.221
or have security stop Kaito,

30:32.265 --> 30:33.788
he might just trigger
the bomb here.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.834
No, we need people there
who understand the situation

30:35.877 --> 30:37.009
and the stakes involved.

30:37.052 --> 30:38.880
Phillips is following up
a lead in Irvine.

30:38.924 --> 30:41.883
Captain, the Feds are an
hour out on a good day.

30:41.927 --> 30:43.232
He's never gonna make
it to the airport

30:43.276 --> 30:44.755
in time.It's up to us, then.

30:44.799 --> 30:46.018
HONDO:
I'll see you there.

30:49.238 --> 30:50.718
Any sign of Kaito?

30:50.761 --> 30:52.024
We don't know
what flight he's boarding

30:52.067 --> 30:53.634
or under what name.

30:53.677 --> 30:54.940
His TSA agent friend

30:54.983 --> 30:56.419
is somewhere
in this terminal, though.

30:56.463 --> 30:58.857
All right. We find him,
maybe he leads us to Kaito.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.859
Deacon and the rest of the
team got here just before us.

31:00.902 --> 31:02.425
They're upstairs on the
other side of the terminal.

31:02.469 --> 31:03.513
All right, good.

31:03.557 --> 31:04.906
We stay cool.

31:04.950 --> 31:06.865
We don't want to spook Kaito
or any of his people.

31:12.958 --> 31:13.915
Deacon.

31:13.959 --> 31:16.396
Anything?

31:22.837 --> 31:24.839
ELLE:
There's our TSA guy.

31:24.883 --> 31:27.146
I don't see Kaito.Or Tanaka.

31:28.974 --> 31:30.323
All right, we got to be fast.

31:30.366 --> 31:32.194
We cannot let them get
a call off and warn him.

31:35.197 --> 31:38.244
Gun!LAPD SWAT!

31:38.287 --> 31:40.594
On the ground!Stop! Stop! Down on the ground.

31:40.637 --> 31:43.292
LAPD!
Drop the gun.
Luca, runner coming your way.

31:47.731 --> 31:49.864
Hands! Give me your hands.

31:51.822 --> 31:52.867
Turn around.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.477
Hands behind your head.

31:54.521 --> 31:55.957
JESSICA:
You got him, Chris?Got him.

31:56.001 --> 31:58.655
Don't move.

31:58.699 --> 32:02.137
Hondo, he tried to text someone,
but he didn't get it off.

32:02.181 --> 32:05.053
You trying to text Kaito
and let him know we're here?

32:05.097 --> 32:07.142
JESSICA: You warn him,
and he might pull the
trigger on the bomb.

32:07.186 --> 32:08.491
Did that ever occur to you?

32:08.535 --> 32:10.189
What about Tanaka?
Where's he?

32:11.668 --> 32:13.366
Going hands-on.

32:13.409 --> 32:15.020
Deac.

32:15.063 --> 32:17.239
Bruising on the knuckles.They were coming out

32:17.283 --> 32:18.588
of that bathroom right there.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.068
Hondo! Captain!

32:22.418 --> 32:23.942
Get your ass up.

32:32.124 --> 32:33.734
Go.

32:37.216 --> 32:38.695
Elle.

32:41.133 --> 32:42.395
Tanaka.

32:46.051 --> 32:48.140
They caught me
trying to call you.

32:48.183 --> 32:50.794
They-they just left
to get something

32:50.838 --> 32:52.144
to move me out of here.

32:52.187 --> 32:53.275
It's okay, Tanaka.

32:53.319 --> 32:55.016
We got Kurata
and the other guy.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.931
But we need to know
where Kaito is.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.977
Uh, the... the plane.

32:59.020 --> 33:01.936
Uh, Flight 1125.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.546
Taking off any minute.

33:03.590 --> 33:06.027
The b-bomb is on the
plane. In luggage.

33:06.071 --> 33:07.333
Go.Go, go, go.

33:13.078 --> 33:15.994
PILOT :
We've closed the aircraft door,
which means we'll be taxiing out

33:16.037 --> 33:17.734
and taking off momentarily.

33:17.778 --> 33:19.258
Welcome aboard.

33:32.140 --> 33:34.621
Kaito's bomb is
in the cargo hold,
but we have to assume

33:34.664 --> 33:36.840
that he can remotely
detonate it with his phone.

33:36.884 --> 33:38.755
Yeah, close quarters,
packed with civilians--
we can't shoot

33:38.799 --> 33:40.844
unless there's
no other option.How do we grab him

33:40.888 --> 33:43.586
and keep his hands away
from his phone without
him seeing us coming?

33:43.630 --> 33:44.761
STREET: Could we get
a flight attendant

33:44.805 --> 33:46.546
to spill something on him,
distract him?

33:46.589 --> 33:48.591
No, we can't involve civilians
like that-- it's too risky.

33:48.635 --> 33:50.463
No, but wecan distract him.

33:52.247 --> 33:55.337
Excuse me. I need
to commandeer your luggage.

33:57.818 --> 33:59.515
This is your captain again.

33:59.559 --> 34:01.648
Looks like we closed the
cabin door a little too soon.

34:01.691 --> 34:04.477
I was just notified we have a
couple of last-minute arrivals.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.218
And we're looking good on time,

34:06.261 --> 34:07.349
so we're gonna let them
on board.

34:07.393 --> 34:09.873
We should be back
underway shortly.

34:24.366 --> 34:25.802
I'm patched in to the pilot.

34:25.846 --> 34:28.327
Hondo and the others are
about to get on the plane.

34:28.370 --> 34:30.720
Hey, the crooked TSA guy
just got a text.

34:30.764 --> 34:32.679
It's from Kaito,
but it's in Japanese.

34:32.722 --> 34:34.246
Agent Trask.

34:36.248 --> 34:38.598
Can you read this?

34:39.642 --> 34:41.601
Uh...

34:41.644 --> 34:43.690
No, I mean, I speak
enough Japanese to get by,

34:43.733 --> 34:45.213
but reading it
is another matter.

34:45.257 --> 34:47.737
If we don't reply,
Kaito's gonna get suspicious.

34:47.781 --> 34:48.999
Use the "speak text" function.

34:49.043 --> 34:50.871
Then you can use
"voice-to-text" to respond.

34:54.657 --> 34:56.659
He says the plane's delayed,

34:56.703 --> 34:58.966
and he's wanting to know
if everything's okay.

35:00.576 --> 35:02.752
Uh, tell him
that there's a crew error.

35:02.796 --> 35:04.406
They closed the cabin door

35:04.450 --> 35:06.843
without checking with the gate.
No problems. Okay.

35:23.382 --> 35:25.775
Hope you got that right.

35:25.819 --> 35:29.823
If I didn't, we won't have
much time to worry about it.

35:34.741 --> 35:37.352
STREET:
You gotta lay off, babe.

35:37.396 --> 35:39.659
Give me 60 seconds of peace.Stop saying that.

35:39.702 --> 35:41.748
Okay? Uh, please?You're saying that all the time.

35:41.791 --> 35:43.924
It was an
honest mistake.Honestly stupid.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.882
Again with the insults. You
know what I did this morning?Oh, my God. Can you stop?

35:45.926 --> 35:47.928
I woke up and I said,
"I'm gonna count how many
times she insults me."

35:47.971 --> 35:49.843
CHRIS:
Okay, can you help me with this?It's not gonna fit in there.

35:49.886 --> 35:52.324
CHRIS:
All right, it is gonna fit.Miss, can we gate-check this?

35:55.327 --> 35:56.502
Got it!

35:58.156 --> 35:59.331
Hands! Down!

35:59.374 --> 36:01.159
Give me your hands!

36:01.202 --> 36:02.072
LAPD.

36:02.116 --> 36:03.378
Don't move.

36:05.815 --> 36:08.601
Captain, we got Kaito.

36:08.644 --> 36:10.168
We're good.

36:11.908 --> 36:13.954
Let's move.

36:16.304 --> 36:18.698
Sitrep.JESSICA: Don't worry,
Agent Phillips.

36:18.741 --> 36:20.526
LAPD SWAT is in the building.

36:20.569 --> 36:22.223
We have the situation
under control.

36:22.267 --> 36:23.964
They have Kaito in custody, sir.

36:24.007 --> 36:26.619
Not bad for the B-team, huh?

36:30.884 --> 36:33.016
Well, glad to hear it.

36:37.064 --> 36:39.197
TAN: He tweaked his wrist again
taking down Kaito.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.589
Well, it's not too late
to get Dr. Sherrill

36:40.633 --> 36:42.069
down here with an
anti-inflammatory shot.

36:42.112 --> 36:44.811
Nah, I can't do it, Commander.I know you have

36:44.854 --> 36:45.942
your own way of doing things,

36:45.986 --> 36:47.640
but there's a lot
on the line here.

36:47.683 --> 36:50.208
Mina here's got it
under control.Luca,

36:50.251 --> 36:51.774
this is
Fire versus Police pride.

36:51.818 --> 36:53.559
Just get the shot.

36:54.647 --> 36:57.258
I got a thing about needles.

36:57.302 --> 36:59.478
A "thing"?Yeah.

36:59.521 --> 37:01.741
You're afraid of needles?Yeah, I'm afraid
of needles. Okay?

37:01.784 --> 37:04.047
Luca, you've been stabbed
with a knife before--
it's gonna feel like nothing.

37:04.091 --> 37:05.788
LUCA: I've heard it all.
Bottom line is, no one's putting

37:05.832 --> 37:07.834
a needle in my wrist
or anywhere else in my body.

37:07.877 --> 37:10.663
Unless there's literally
no other option.

37:10.706 --> 37:12.055
I know my body, okay?

37:12.099 --> 37:14.057
I'm gonna beat this guy,
trust me.

37:14.101 --> 37:16.016
All right.

37:16.059 --> 37:19.715
Soon as I get to the gym,
I'll be good as new.

37:19.759 --> 37:21.935
Mina's got this.

37:21.978 --> 37:23.197
Zhi zi.

37:26.722 --> 37:27.854
Zhi zi.

37:27.897 --> 37:30.813
That's how you say it.

37:32.728 --> 37:34.295
Hey, Chris.

37:34.339 --> 37:36.558
Thought about
what you said.

37:36.602 --> 37:37.994
Yeah?

37:38.038 --> 37:40.823
Yeah. Uh, I talked it
over with Annie, and...

37:40.867 --> 37:42.303
actually, we'd love
it if you'd be

37:42.347 --> 37:43.957

girl's godmother.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.742
Wow!

37:46.786 --> 37:49.789
I mean, yes, uh,
the answer is yes.

37:49.832 --> 37:51.399
I'm so honored.

37:51.443 --> 37:53.314
All right, we'll figure out
the details after she's born.

37:53.358 --> 37:56.012
Okay. So does that mean I get
to pick her name now, right?

37:56.056 --> 37:57.666
No, you do not.

37:57.710 --> 38:00.539
Y'all seen Agent Trask
leaving HQ?

38:00.582 --> 38:01.844
No. She take off already?

38:01.888 --> 38:03.759
Yeah, looks like it.Too much of
a big shot

38:03.803 --> 38:06.240
to say goodbyes, huh?How about, "Thanks
for saving the city"?

38:06.284 --> 38:09.330
I'd have settled for,
"Thanks for saving my ass."
