{\an5}<i>GIRL:</i>
<i>I weighed 70 pounds</i>
<i>when my parents checked me in.</i>

01:42.435 --> 01:45.563
And the doctor said

01:45.647 --> 01:47.357
that he would discharge me

01:47.440 --> 01:50.193
when I got up to 85,

01:50.276 --> 01:53.321
and I went nuts.

01:53.404 --> 01:56.616
It's like 85 pounds?

01:56.699 --> 01:57.492
You'll ruin me.

01:57.575 --> 02:00.703
When you hit 85,
<i>were</i> you ruined?

02:00.787 --> 02:02.372
I thought I was.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.874
{\an3}When I went home,
someone said

02:04.958 --> 02:07.168
{\an3}that I was
looking better,

02:07.252 --> 02:08.877
and I stayed in my room
for three days.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.213
What made you finally come out?

02:10.295 --> 02:12.382
I had to get away
from my mother.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.676
(scattered laughter)

02:14.759 --> 02:16.678
I'm not kidding.

02:16.761 --> 02:18.888
Kelly Taylor.

02:18.972 --> 02:22.684
Would you like to tell us
something about yourself?

02:22.767 --> 02:23.643
<i>KELLY:</i>
<i>Mom, I am begging you.</i>

02:23.726 --> 02:26.062
Please don't make me
go back to that place.

02:26.145 --> 02:27.897
The girls there are crazy.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.899
They're not crazy.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.359
Yes, they are.

02:31.442 --> 02:33.444
One of the girls got so thin
that the doctors at the hospital

02:33.528 --> 02:35.738
had to start force-feeding her
through a tube.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.448
Then you know what she did?

02:37.532 --> 02:39.075
She pinched off the tube
because she still wanted

02:39.158 --> 02:41.411
to lose a couple of pounds.

02:41.494 --> 02:44.497
Maybe we should try to
find you another group.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.791
{\an1}I don't want
to be in any group.

02:46.875 --> 02:49.419
Come on, Kelly.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.754
You're a beautiful girl,

02:51.838 --> 02:54.966
but you have got to start
taking care of yourself.

02:55.049 --> 02:56.801
{\an1}Do you know how many models
I knew in New York

02:56.885 --> 02:59.262
{\an1}who ruined their health
and their careers

02:59.345 --> 03:00.930
{\an1}because of
not eating properly?

03:01.014 --> 03:02.390
The last thing I want

03:02.473 --> 03:03.975
is for you to end up
back in the hospital.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.435
{\an3}Me either.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.478
I mean, if this was supposed
to be like Scared Straight

03:07.562 --> 03:10.106
{\an1}or something,
it's working, okay?

03:10.189 --> 03:12.775
{\an1}I even stopped on the way home
and got a mega burger.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.986
It's even got mayonnaise.

03:15.069 --> 03:16.613
This is serious, Kelly.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.284
{\an3}Are your friends giving
you a hard time

03:21.367 --> 03:23.119
{\an3}about being
in this group?

03:23.202 --> 03:24.787
{\an1}No. That's probably because
none of them

03:24.871 --> 03:26.039
know I'm in therapy.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.290
David knows.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.083
Dylan doesn't.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.335
Dylan is in AA.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.754
{\an3}If anybody would
understand, he would.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.839
{\an1}Yeah.
An eating disorder group.

03:34.923 --> 03:35.965
That's very attractive.

03:36.049 --> 03:36.466
Kelly.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.010
Mom, I made a mistake.

03:39.093 --> 03:40.428
I didn't follow directions.

03:40.511 --> 03:41.638
I wasn't trying
to kill myself.

03:41.721 --> 03:42.972
{\an1}I am not like
those other girls.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.808
{\an1}Please?

03:45.892 --> 03:47.518
Okay, if that's
what you want,

03:47.602 --> 03:49.979
{\an3}but only as long
as you keep eating.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.815
I will. I am. See?

03:52.899 --> 03:55.902
Mmm... so good.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.374
(overlapping chatter)

04:11.584 --> 04:13.836
All you seniors who
haven't cast your votes yet

04:13.920 --> 04:15.338
for the senior poll,
you have until third period

04:15.421 --> 04:19.175
to scar your fellow
classmates for life.

04:20.551 --> 04:23.471
Ugh. Like this school needs
another popularity contest.

04:23.554 --> 04:25.014
Don't worry, Bren,

04:25.098 --> 04:26.849
I'm sure you're going to
win Done Most For Class.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.226
I'm serious.

04:28.309 --> 04:29.644
{\an3}You organized
the Pigskin Prom,

04:29.727 --> 04:31.562
the Christmas trip
to Alvarado Street,

04:31.646 --> 04:34.899
{\an3}the orientation program
for the Freshman Buddies.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.442
Brandon, it doesn't matter.

04:36.526 --> 04:37.902
If it's anything like last year,
all the winners

04:37.986 --> 04:39.862
will have known each other
since, like, second grade.

04:39.946 --> 04:43.116
{\an3}I just can't believe
that you care.

04:43.199 --> 04:45.743
You mean you don't think that,
let's say, ten years from now,

04:45.827 --> 04:48.037
you'll get a kick looking back
at the final issue of <i> The Blaze</i>

04:48.121 --> 04:50.707
and remembering that
your friends and your classmates

04:50.790 --> 04:52.542
thought that you were one
of the best and the brightest?

04:52.625 --> 04:56.045
{\an3}Truthfully, Bren, I haven't
given it much thought.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.547
You mean you haven't voted?

04:57.630 --> 05:00.883
Well, yeah, I... I voted.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.051
And you didn't vote
for yourself?

05:02.135 --> 05:04.053
In any category?

05:04.137 --> 05:07.098
I rest my case.

05:10.601 --> 05:11.894
{\an3}Hey, Steve.

05:11.978 --> 05:12.895
Look at my books, man!

05:12.979 --> 05:14.522
{\an1}One of those subhumans
in detention

05:14.605 --> 05:15.606
wrote graffiti all over them.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.942
"Thumper"?

05:18.026 --> 05:20.403
Maybe now I can finally
guilt-trip Mrs. Teasley

05:20.486 --> 05:22.071
{\an1}into admitting
I shouldn't be incarcerated

05:22.155 --> 05:23.239
with any of those lunatics.

05:23.322 --> 05:24.574
8:00 in the morning,

05:24.657 --> 05:26.909
{\an1}it's already turning
into a red-letter day.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.578
{\an1}Man... did you get my message
about Celeste?

05:28.661 --> 05:31.247
Yeah, yeah. How come
she and her friend

05:31.330 --> 05:32.957
{\an3}don't want to go to
the Lakers game with us?

05:33.041 --> 05:34.917
{\an1}She said
she had other plans.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.794
{\an1}First time I asked her out
since our TV dream date,

05:36.878 --> 05:39.422
and she passes...
not a good sign.

05:39.505 --> 05:41.758
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm feeling a little iffy

05:41.841 --> 05:43.926
about going to
a basketball game myself.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.053
Don't worry, Brandon.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.971
I've got tickets
in the no-gambling section.

05:47.055 --> 05:47.847
If you even think about betting,

05:47.930 --> 05:49.932
the ushers come
and smack you around.

05:50.016 --> 05:50.683
Good.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.769
Think "dateage."

05:52.852 --> 05:54.270
We need two live ones
Friday night,

05:54.353 --> 05:57.106
and bring condoms
because I feel lucky.

05:59.817 --> 06:03.863
(R&amp;B tune playing
over PA system)

06:03.946 --> 06:07.408
{\an3}TEASLEY:
Right. No, I understand.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.994
{\an3}Yes. Believe me,
I don't want

06:10.078 --> 06:12.080
{\an3}your camp program
to fall apart either,

06:12.163 --> 06:14.791
{\an3}but my first responsibility
has to be to the students

06:14.874 --> 06:15.875
of West Beverly High,

06:15.958 --> 06:16.667
{\an3}not Alvarado
Street Elementary.

06:16.751 --> 06:20.588
Yeah. Maybe next year.

06:24.967 --> 06:27.678
Uh... Mrs. Teasley?

06:27.762 --> 06:30.348
(sighs)
Yes, Steven?

06:30.431 --> 06:32.600
I couldn't help hearing what
you said about Alvarado Street.

06:32.683 --> 06:34.352
Are they having some financial
difficulties or something?

06:34.435 --> 06:36.604
To put it mildly.

06:36.687 --> 06:38.940
Actually, our budget
is the one being cut back.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.984
And, apparently, after 14 years,
there are not enough funds

06:42.068 --> 06:45.446
{\an3}to support a summer camp
on our campus anymore.

06:45.530 --> 06:46.489
Oh, that's too bad.
You know, I had such a blast

06:46.572 --> 06:48.825
playing Santa for those kids
last Christmas.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.702
I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.331
Did you need something,
Steven?

06:55.414 --> 06:57.875
I guess now is not
a good time, huh?

06:57.959 --> 07:02.213
Sometimes your power of
observation is truly remarkable.

07:11.889 --> 07:13.975
Guess who.

07:14.058 --> 07:16.644
{\an6}It has to be the
most beautiful girl
at West Beverly.

07:16.727 --> 07:18.479
Oh, and, if that's
the way you feel,

07:18.563 --> 07:19.647
how come you didn't
call me back last night?

07:19.730 --> 07:23.192
{\an1}Well, when I'm writing,
I lose all sense of time.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.402
So you say.

07:24.485 --> 07:26.070
What? You think I was playing
around behind your back, Kel?

07:26.154 --> 07:27.113
I was kidding.

07:27.196 --> 07:30.658
{\an1}I know.
It's just that, well,

07:30.741 --> 07:33.828
I've been grappling with some
pretty heavy things, you know?

07:33.911 --> 07:34.745
{\an1}I've been writing
about my dad and...

07:34.829 --> 07:38.040
I know. How's it going?

07:38.124 --> 07:39.667
I don't know.
I mean, I'm too close to it.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.669
I just... I got to make
some last-minute revisions.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.880
So you're almost done?

07:43.963 --> 07:45.006
Almost.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.174
When do I get to read it?

07:46.257 --> 07:48.926
When it's finished,
just like everybody else.

07:49.010 --> 07:49.594
I understand.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.721
I knew you would.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.556
Where are you going?

07:53.639 --> 07:54.599
You're not gonna stick around
to hear the results

07:54.682 --> 07:57.018
of the senior poNo.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.020
{\an6}You're going to
make me go through
this all by myself?

07:59.103 --> 08:00.271
Kel, you're a big girl, okay?

08:00.354 --> 08:00.771
I think you can handle it.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.815
You are a coward!

08:13.659 --> 08:15.953
Is this what I think it is?

08:16.037 --> 08:17.371
Well, it's a rough draft.

08:17.455 --> 08:18.956
I can't believe
you're done already.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.416
It's only the first chapter.

08:20.499 --> 08:23.085
It's mostly, um... well,
it's stuff about my father.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.921
{\an3}I'm sure it'll
require some editing

08:25.004 --> 08:26.756
{\an3}if you want to publish
part of it in <i> The Blaze.</i>

08:26.839 --> 08:28.633
Probably.

08:28.716 --> 08:32.595
Look, if you don't have time
to read it now...

08:32.678 --> 08:34.429
Hey, I'll make time to read it.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.433
Dylan, I'm honored that you're
letting me see this, really.

08:37.515 --> 08:38.558
Thanks.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.023
Hey, Brandon.

08:44.106 --> 08:45.024
{\an3}Do you know when
they're going

08:45.107 --> 08:46.234
{\an3}to announce the results
of the senior poll?

08:46.317 --> 08:48.402
{\an5}Yeah. I think Donna
and David are going
to do it at lunch.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.404
Why?A little.ous?

08:50.488 --> 08:51.739
I just don't want
to be remembered

08:51.822 --> 08:53.658
as the girl who OD'd
on her 18th birthday.

08:53.741 --> 08:56.285
{\an1}Did I tell you it's good
to have you back?

08:56.369 --> 08:58.955
{\an6}Well, I never
really left,
but thanks.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.748
{\an6}STEVE:
Hey! Well, if it isn't
our Most Likely to Succeed

09:00.831 --> 09:02.833
and our Most Beautiful.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.460
{\an3}Very funny.

09:04.543 --> 09:06.003
Hey, I call 'em like I see 'em.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.296
{\an3}Well, you don't
have to humor me.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.965
You haven't looked
in the mirror lately.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.967
Hey, Brando, what's the deal
with the senior poll?

09:11.050 --> 09:12.885
{\an1}I really don't know
any more than you guys do.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.595
Yeah, yeah.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.806
{\an5}Come on, Brandon,
<i>The Blaze</i> runs
the senior poll.

09:16.889 --> 09:17.807
That's right, Kelly.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.475
{\an1}<i>The Blaze</i> does
run the senior poll,

09:19.558 --> 09:20.226
{\an1}but the juniors
who work on the paper

09:20.309 --> 09:21.811
{\an1}keep the ballots
under lock and key

09:21.894 --> 09:24.021
{\an1}so that certain people
won't be tempted

09:24.105 --> 09:26.440
{\an1}to have their friends
stuff the ballots.

09:26.524 --> 09:27.733
Hey, I resemble that remark.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.986
{\an3}Well, Brandon,
you are a definite

09:30.069 --> 09:32.321
{\an3}for Most Likely
to Succeed.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.407
{\an6}And Biggest Flirt
has your name
written all over it.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.033
You think so?

09:36.117 --> 09:37.827
I've seen it firsthand.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.829
{\an3}But if all else fails,
there's always Best Dressed.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.998
{\an1}Guys, I really think
you're blowing

09:42.081 --> 09:43.958
this senior poll thing
way out of proportion.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.459
{\an1}I mean, it's not like the
Nobel Peace Prize or anything.

09:45.543 --> 09:48.004
Gee, I didn't know they gave
a Nobel Prize for Biggest Flirt.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.505
{\an3}(chuckles)

09:49.588 --> 09:51.674
{\an5}DAVID:
And now, the award
for Most Athletic.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.009
And the winner is

09:53.092 --> 09:54.802
Tony Miller,

09:54.885 --> 09:58.723
{\an3}all-league linebacker
and heck of a guy.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.975
And he will share
the honor with...

10:01.058 --> 10:02.727
{\an3}Well, well, we had
a successful

10:02.810 --> 10:04.353
{\an3}write-in campaign
for Olympic

10:04.437 --> 10:06.564
gold medalist Kristi Yamaguchi.

10:06.647 --> 10:07.732
Did I miss much?

10:07.815 --> 10:10.985
Well, Brandon and Andrea won
for Most Likely to Succeed,

10:11.068 --> 10:13.946
David got Most Talented, and
Donna won for Best Dressed.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.865
What about Steve?

10:16.782 --> 10:18.701
Don't even say a word.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.703
Steve, it'Shh!aningless.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.705
I didn't hear
you say that

10:22.788 --> 10:23.831
{\an3}when you won Most Likely
to Succeed, Bran.

10:23.914 --> 10:27.293
{\an5}Biggest Flirt will
be no surprise to
anyone in a skirt.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.503
{\an6}Well, at least there
is some justice
in this world.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.339
It's Tim James.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.883
And, for Flirtette,
Claudette Fletcher.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.719
{\an1}Hey, Steve, Steve,
it's a stupid poll, man.

10:36.802 --> 10:37.678
Your life is not over.

10:37.762 --> 10:38.888
{\an3}No,<i> your</i> life
is not over, okay?

10:38.971 --> 10:41.724
{\an3}I can't even get a date
to the Laker game.

10:41.807 --> 10:42.725
Okay, Done Most for the Class
is next.

10:42.808 --> 10:46.896
And the winners are...

10:46.979 --> 10:48.856
{\an3}Adam Collins
and Leah Mulder.

10:48.939 --> 10:51.859
Leah Mulder?

10:51.942 --> 10:53.861
{\an3}Well, she did convince
Fashion Emporium

10:53.944 --> 10:55.780
{\an3}to give a ten percent discount
to every dues-paying senior.

10:55.863 --> 10:58.908
{\an5}DONNA:
And, Leah, we all thank you
from the bottom of our closets.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.911
Didn't you and Leah go to, like,
elementary school together?

11:01.994 --> 11:05.915
{\an3}Yeah. I've known her
since, like, second grade.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.750
{\an1}Okay, Most Handsome
is next.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.544
{\an1}And, first, I would
like to emphasize

11:10.628 --> 11:11.921
that I personally voted
for my most talented boyfriend,

11:12.004 --> 11:12.963
David, right here.

11:13.047 --> 11:16.384
You're welcome.

11:16.467 --> 11:20.096
But the winner
is Dylan McKay!

11:24.225 --> 11:24.767
Where is Dylan?

11:24.850 --> 11:27.770
Well, you know him.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.939
Anything to avoid
a class activity.

11:30.022 --> 11:35.277
{\an3}And now, West Beverly's
choice for Most Beautiful.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.946
And the winner is

11:37.029 --> 11:41.450
the one and the only--

11:41.534 --> 11:44.120
there she is--
Kelly Taylor.

11:44.203 --> 11:48.249
Congratulations. Go.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.962
There she is, our queen.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.548
Without her king.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.428
ANDREA:
<i>You're a terrific writer.</i>

12:00.511 --> 12:01.971
Well, I'm glad you like it.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.305
When should I send it off
to Doubleday?

12:03.389 --> 12:05.975
Well, actually,
I have a few minor notes,

12:06.058 --> 12:07.977
if you don't mind feedback.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.146
Oh, absolutely. That's why
I gave it to you to read.

12:10.229 --> 12:11.981
But, Zuckerman,
don't be too brutal.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.150
Wouldn't think of it.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.151
Oh, by the way,

12:15.234 --> 12:17.528
congrats
on winning Most Handsome.

12:17.611 --> 12:19.864
Yeah. Now my life
is complete, huh?

12:19.947 --> 12:20.573
(doorbell rings)

12:20.656 --> 12:22.324
Hey, Zuckerman, there's someone

12:22.408 --> 12:23.576
at the door. I got to bail.

12:23.659 --> 12:23.951
I'll callBye. though.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.667
Did somebody here
order takeout?

12:31.750 --> 12:33.836
{\an3}Anybody here
order takeout?

12:33.919 --> 12:36.046
{\an3}Nope. Sorry. You got
the wrong house.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.966
{\an3}You're in
a strange mood.

12:39.049 --> 12:41.969
You always do that to me.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.888
Mm-hmm. Ever
since kindergarten.

12:43.971 --> 12:46.849
{\an1}Remember? You gave me
half your cookie?

12:46.932 --> 12:47.850
I cannot believe you
remember that stuff.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.853
Oh, yeah. I remember
all kinds of things.

12:50.936 --> 12:53.689
{\an1}I've been flashing back
to my memories a lot lately.

12:53.772 --> 12:56.692
You know, I did a pilgrimage
down to the old playground.

12:56.775 --> 12:57.818
{\an1}You should
do it sometime.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.278
{\an1}It gets you back
to your roots in a hurry.

12:59.361 --> 13:00.154
Oh, yeah. That's
just what I need.

13:00.237 --> 13:01.864
The prettiest girl
in Beverly Hills--

13:01.947 --> 13:04.283
that's just what I need.

13:06.076 --> 13:08.579
Dylan, they're
taking the pictures

13:08.662 --> 13:09.788
for the senior poll tomorrow,

13:09.872 --> 13:11.999
{\an3}and they want us to dress
appropriate for the category.

13:12.082 --> 13:14.543
{\an3}So I was thinking
it would be really fun

13:14.627 --> 13:15.920
if you wore, like, a tux,

13:16.003 --> 13:18.339
{\an3}and I wore a really
elegant evening gown.

13:18.422 --> 13:19.089
How about you wear
whatever you want,

13:19.173 --> 13:20.966
{\an1}and I'll wear a bag
over my head?

13:21.050 --> 13:24.053
Seriously.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.721
I am serious.

13:25.804 --> 13:26.055
Dylan...

13:26.138 --> 13:28.140
{\an1}Kelly...

13:28.224 --> 13:29.934
It's bad enough you wouldn't
go to the quad with me

13:30.017 --> 13:31.894
when they announced
the results,

13:31.977 --> 13:33.062
but now to wear a bag over
your head in the picture?

13:33.145 --> 13:35.564
{\an3}What are you
trying to say?

13:35.648 --> 13:37.566
That I think the senior poll
thing is a big joke.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.234
I mean, that's it.
Over and out.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.569
It has nothing to do with you.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.238
{\an6}Well, considering
I'm standing next
to you in the picture,

13:42.321 --> 13:43.906
{\an3}I think it has everything
to do with me.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.533
You know, winning Most Beautiful

13:45.616 --> 13:47.243
is not the most important
thing in my life either.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.285
All right. I know.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.037
{\an3}Okay, let's just...
just forget I said anything

13:50.120 --> 13:53.415
{\an5}and I'll wear the
Fred Astaire suit--
top hat, tails--

13:53.499 --> 13:54.875
and we'll have
a great time.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.418
Don't do my any favors.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.170
Come here.

14:12.017 --> 14:15.271
{\an1}You should have won
the Sexiest Best Lover.

14:17.314 --> 14:19.233
Is that all I am to you?

14:19.316 --> 14:21.110
Are you kidding?

14:21.193 --> 14:23.195
You're a goddess.

14:28.200 --> 14:32.121
{\an3}Have I ever shown
you my favorite room?

14:32.204 --> 14:34.915
Every chance you get.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.126
{\an3}Well, it's different
this time.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.004
Is it?

14:48.387 --> 14:51.140
Mm-mm-mm.

14:51.223 --> 14:54.018
Better safe than sorry.

14:54.101 --> 14:55.144
{\an3}Yeah.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.741
♪ Every now and then ♪

15:08.824 --> 15:11.493
♪ The planets are aligned... ♪

15:11.577 --> 15:13.954
♪ For a little while... ♪

15:14.038 --> 15:14.997
Bren, you got the school
phone directory in here?

15:15.080 --> 15:17.708
Yeah, it's on my desk.

15:17.791 --> 15:18.208
Who are you calling?

15:18.292 --> 15:20.961
Patty Crawford.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.338
Why?

15:22.421 --> 15:23.839
I promised Steve I'd try

15:23.922 --> 15:25.841
{\an1}to round up some dates
for us for Friday night.

15:25.924 --> 15:27.551
But she's such a snob.

15:27.635 --> 15:28.218
{\an1}Well, she did win
Best Dancer.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.638
Rub it in, why don't you?

15:30.721 --> 15:32.014
{\an1}(chuckles)
Come on, Bren,

15:32.097 --> 15:35.017
{\an1}would you rather have won
Most Naive like Donna?

15:35.100 --> 15:37.019
Donna also won
Friendliest and Funniest Laugh.

15:37.102 --> 15:41.857
{\an1}Why is there a University of
Minnesota application in here?

15:41.940 --> 15:44.193
{\an1}I thought we decided we'd both
go to California University.

15:44.276 --> 15:47.571
{\an3}Brandon, I'm just
keeping my options open.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.573
Just because you didn't win
anything in the senior poll.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.368
{\an3}Excuse me, but I filled
out that application

15:52.451 --> 15:53.827
more than a week ago, okay?

15:53.911 --> 15:56.372
{\an1}Bren, you've been
in California so long

15:56.455 --> 15:57.706
{\an1}I think you may
be forgetting

15:57.790 --> 15:58.874
{\an1}what a Midwestern
winter is like.

15:58.957 --> 16:02.044
{\an3}And you've forgotten how many
friends we had back there.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.129
Come on, Bren, when do
you think the last time

16:04.213 --> 16:06.090
{\an1}Darla Hansen even gave you
a passing thought?

16:06.173 --> 16:10.052
{\an3}Oh, about a half hour ago
when she and I were discussing

16:10.135 --> 16:11.845
rooming together
in the same dorm.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.014
Sounds like a lot more than just
keeping your options open.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.392
Have you told Mom and Dad

16:16.475 --> 16:17.893
you're thinking about
moving back there?

16:17.976 --> 16:20.729
Not yet.

16:20.813 --> 16:21.897
{\an3}And I would appreciate
it if you'd let me

16:21.980 --> 16:22.856
{\an3}break it to them
my own way.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.900
It says here
your application deadline...

16:24.983 --> 16:27.152
{\an3}Brandon, don't you have
a phone call to make?

16:31.281 --> 16:34.201
I don't even like
Patty Crawford.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.285
Patty, you really don't
have to explain.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.413
It's okay.

16:37.496 --> 16:38.205
I didn't realize there was
any bad blood

16:38.288 --> 16:40.249
between you and Steve.

16:40.332 --> 16:43.877
Yeah, sure,
maybe some other time.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.295
(chuckles)

16:45.379 --> 16:47.881
Yeah, bye now.

16:47.965 --> 16:48.882
(sighs)

16:48.966 --> 16:50.342
So much for
Most Likely To Succeed.

16:55.305 --> 16:56.265
(door opens)

16:56.348 --> 16:57.266
Hey, Dad.

16:57.349 --> 17:00.060
How's it going?

17:00.144 --> 17:02.896
(groans)

17:05.733 --> 17:07.276
You look fantastic.

17:07.358 --> 17:08.402
Thanks.

17:08.484 --> 17:09.444
One scoop or two?

17:09.528 --> 17:10.319
Make mine a double.

17:10.404 --> 17:13.991
{\an1}Tax time gets more
ridiculous every year.

17:14.074 --> 17:14.782
What's your excuse?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.952
{\an3}Well, it's kind of
embarrassing.

17:17.035 --> 17:18.746
{\an3}Steve has some tickets to
the Laker game tomorrow night,

17:18.829 --> 17:20.204
{\an3}and we can't seem to find
anyone to go with us.

17:20.289 --> 17:23.791
{\an3}So, if you and Mom
aren't busy...

17:25.669 --> 17:26.587
That's the nicest invitation
I've had all year.

17:26.670 --> 17:30.090
{\an1}What's the nicest invitation
you've had all year?

17:30.174 --> 17:32.801
Your son just invited us
to the Laker game

17:32.885 --> 17:34.845
{\an1}with him and Steve
tomorrow night.

17:34.928 --> 17:36.305
{\an1}Hey, that sounds like
a lot of fun.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.807
The problem is I've got
a million returns due

17:38.891 --> 17:39.975
by the 15th.

17:40.058 --> 17:41.810
{\an3}Hey, if you guys
can't go, that's okay,

17:41.894 --> 17:42.269
{\an3}I totally understand.
No problem.

17:42.352 --> 17:45.189
Jim, come on.

17:45.272 --> 17:46.815
Oh, you're right.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.817
{\an5}The hell with it.
I haven't been to
a game all season.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.612
It really means a lot to me
that you, uh,

17:51.695 --> 17:53.197
you still want to spend a Friday
night with your old man.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.364
{\an1}CINDY:
Oh, and thank Steve for us.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.659
I sure will.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.745
(chuckles)

18:04.708 --> 18:06.335
{\an3}Well, if I didn't
talk to David,

18:06.418 --> 18:08.921
I wouldn't know anything
that's going on with you.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.714
Congratulations,
Most Beautiful.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.549
I wanted to surprise you.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.092
So I raided your closet.

18:16.261 --> 18:18.347
Well, what do you think?

18:18.430 --> 18:19.848
Perfect.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.184
Yeah. I just feel like something
is a little off.

18:22.267 --> 18:26.021
Well, if you're going to
wear a dress like that,

18:26.105 --> 18:28.482
{\an3}you've got to
upgrade those eyes.

18:28.565 --> 18:30.818
{\an3}Like mother,
like daughter.

18:30.901 --> 18:34.196
Invisible eyelashes
and pale as a ghost.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.406
That's better.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.867
See, I do come in handy
every once in a while.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.410
{\an3}I could give you a few
tips, if you want.

18:40.494 --> 18:42.037
No, I've got to go.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.372
It's just a school picture.

18:43.455 --> 18:46.166
Well, that is what I thought
about my high school picture,

18:46.250 --> 18:47.543
until it got picked up

18:47.626 --> 18:50.671
in a "Girls of Ohio" spread
in <i> Esquire,</i>

18:50.754 --> 18:53.382
{\an1}and the next thing I knew
I was modeling in New York.

18:53.465 --> 18:54.216
{\an3}Oh, I don't want
to be a model.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.217
Of course not.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.678
{\an1}I wouldn't wish that
on anybody.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.680
{\an1}But there's nothing wrong
with looking like one,

18:59.763 --> 19:01.890
{\an3}is there?

19:01.974 --> 19:04.226
Now, what do you think?

19:04.309 --> 19:07.104
That's nice.

19:07.187 --> 19:08.605
I used to love to
put your hair up

19:08.689 --> 19:10.023
when you were little.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.694
Yeah, maybe I should
wear it up then.

19:13.777 --> 19:14.278
{\an3}Well, it would
show off your neck.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.405
Highlight your angle.

19:16.488 --> 19:17.573
My angle?

19:17.656 --> 19:20.325
{\an3}Kelly, every woman needs to
know how to hold her head

19:20.409 --> 19:23.412
{\an3}so she looks her
absolute best.

19:23.495 --> 19:24.872
{\an3}For a model that is
the difference between

19:24.955 --> 19:27.207
$10,000 a day
and nothing.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.041
Don't worry.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.502
{\an3}We will make you
look unforgettable.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.633
DAVID (over PA):
Attention senior poll winners,

19:36.717 --> 19:38.969
last call for photos
in the quad.

19:39.052 --> 19:40.304
Be there or be square.

19:40.387 --> 19:41.763
(Steve laughing)

19:41.847 --> 19:44.308
Ah, so is this how you
dress for success?

19:44.391 --> 19:45.976
That's what they tell me.

19:46.059 --> 19:47.603
{\an3}You know, I think the <i> Blaze</i>
should've had a category

19:47.686 --> 19:48.937
{\an3}for Most Time Spent
in Detention.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.939
No, no, it's cool.
It's old news.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.232
What I'd like to know is,

19:52.316 --> 19:53.775
{\an3}who's going to the game
with us tonight?

19:53.859 --> 19:55.611
{\an1}I kind of wanted to talk
to you about that.

19:55.694 --> 19:56.778
Come here.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.947
{\an1}Oh, oh, don't even
tell me you struck out?

19:59.031 --> 20:00.616
{\an3}No, no, no, I
didn't strike out.

20:00.699 --> 20:03.619
{\an3}I somehow managed
to invite my parents.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.162
You're kidding?

20:05.245 --> 20:07.581
No, I'm not kidding,
it just slipped out.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.791
{\an3}Look, you don't
mind, do you?

20:09.875 --> 20:11.293
{\an1}Brandon, yeah,
I kind of do mind!

20:11.376 --> 20:12.794
{\an3}Look, you shouldn't have
put me in charge

20:12.878 --> 20:14.421
of organizing your
social life, Steve.

20:14.504 --> 20:16.256
{\an1}Obviously.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.799
How could you
do this to me?

20:17.883 --> 20:18.634
{\an1}Don't I have enough
trouble as it is?

20:18.717 --> 20:21.136
{\an3}Steve, I hate to
inform you of this,

20:21.219 --> 20:22.930
{\an3}but some jerk defacing
your school books

20:23.013 --> 20:24.139
and not winning
the senior poll

20:24.222 --> 20:26.767
{\an3}are not exactly the major
issues of our time.

20:26.850 --> 20:27.976
(sighs)

20:28.060 --> 20:29.311
No, it's okay.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.939
{\an1}We'll go to the game with
your folks on one condition--

20:32.022 --> 20:33.774
{\an1}you sit next
to your mother.

20:33.857 --> 20:36.068
{\an3}What's wrong with
my mother?

20:43.867 --> 20:45.619
And I thought I was gonna
be able to sneak in by myself

20:45.702 --> 20:47.996
and put on some mascara
before the photo session.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.499
{\an1}Oh, well,
take a number.

20:50.582 --> 20:51.375
{\an1}You think I look
too naive?

20:51.458 --> 20:53.377
I think you look adorable.

20:53.460 --> 20:56.672
And I loved your outfit
as Best Dressed.

20:56.755 --> 20:57.673
It was great.

20:57.756 --> 20:58.507
You're welcome.

20:58.590 --> 21:01.343
{\an1}Well, I don't think
you need mascara.

21:01.426 --> 21:02.636
You have great eyes.

21:02.719 --> 21:04.179
You have great everything.

21:04.262 --> 21:05.347
Only if I work at it.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.516
{\an3}Oh, yeah, Kelly Taylor
a total car chaser.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.811
{\an1}You have to admit
my eyelashes are invisible.

21:10.894 --> 21:12.187
I'm as pale as a ghost.

21:12.270 --> 21:13.605
I have no cheekbones,

21:13.689 --> 21:15.524
and my nose is never
gonna be quite right.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.192
{\an3}Oh, will you can
the self-pity?

21:17.275 --> 21:18.360
Like every girl
in this school

21:18.443 --> 21:19.820
wouldn't trade places
with you in a second.

21:19.903 --> 21:21.029
I'll trade.

21:21.113 --> 21:21.655
{\an1}Let them spend
their whole lives

21:21.738 --> 21:23.573
trying to look unforgettable

21:23.657 --> 21:24.574
{\an1}just so they can never
be taken seriously.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.535
You're being ridiculous.

21:26.618 --> 21:27.703
Am I?

21:27.786 --> 21:29.538
{\an1}I just said that nobody
takes me seriously

21:29.621 --> 21:31.206
{\an1}and you didn't take me
seriously, did you?

21:31.289 --> 21:33.166
Well, from what Dylan
has been writing,

21:33.250 --> 21:35.168
{\an1}I would say he takes you
very seriously.

21:37.295 --> 21:39.548
{\an1}You've read
Dylan's manuscript?

21:39.631 --> 21:40.424
{\an3}Mm-hmm.
Oh, it's terrific.

21:52.477 --> 21:53.395
{\an3}Thank you.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.855
Uh, clowns, please.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.733
I don't know, McKay.

21:57.816 --> 21:58.734
{\an3}I think you should have
won Best Dressed.

21:58.817 --> 22:01.403
Come on, man, this is
Kelly's idea, all right?

22:01.486 --> 22:02.779
She wanted to make
a fashion statement,

22:02.863 --> 22:04.906
so this is my homage
to Fred Astaire.

22:04.990 --> 22:05.949
Except he could dance.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.743
You Dylan....

22:07.826 --> 22:08.577
Yeah, hey, good looking.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.203
Now, is this what
you haNo.n mind?

22:10.287 --> 22:11.413
Can I talk to you?

22:11.496 --> 22:13.081
Hey, Dylan,
don't go too far away.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.750
You're on deck.

22:14.833 --> 22:15.584
What's the matter?

22:15.667 --> 22:18.420
{\an1}When do I get to read
your manuscript?

22:18.503 --> 22:19.713
{\an3}I told you,
when it's ready.

22:19.796 --> 22:20.964
{\an1}Why is it done enough
for Andrea to read?

22:21.048 --> 22:23.759
Because she's my editor.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.761
{\an6}And she's the one that
got me into writing
in the first place.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.971
Then why don't you
go to bed with her?

22:28.055 --> 22:30.432
{\an3}What are you...
what are you saying?

22:30.515 --> 22:31.600
I'm saying that I really resent
being good enough to sleep with,

22:31.683 --> 22:33.935
{\an1}but not good enough
to show your writing to.

22:34.019 --> 22:34.936
{\an3}Okay, I will show it
to you, all right?

22:35.020 --> 22:36.146
{\an1}Not because
you value my opinion,

22:36.229 --> 22:38.106
only because you want
me to shut up, right?

22:38.190 --> 22:39.191
Hey, McKay, where are you going?

22:39.274 --> 22:40.484
Hey, I'll be right back.

22:40.567 --> 22:41.818
Kel, listen, I don't know
what's going on with you,

22:41.902 --> 22:42.861
but I do value your opinion.

22:42.944 --> 22:45.739
{\an3}No, you value the way I look
and the way I dress

22:45.822 --> 22:47.449
{\an3}and the fact that
I have sex with you.

22:47.532 --> 22:48.742
{\an3}But you don't listen
to a thing I say.

22:48.825 --> 22:49.910
I don't listen to you?

22:49.993 --> 22:51.286
{\an1}Who was I listening to
when I picked up

22:51.369 --> 22:53.121
{\an1}this ridiculous hat
and this stupid cane?!

22:53.205 --> 22:54.790
I don't want to have
this picture taken anyway.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.583
Fine, then we
won't take it.

22:56.666 --> 22:59.169
I want to take it.

22:59.252 --> 23:00.295
Well, then don't forget
to smile for the camera.

23:11.264 --> 23:13.225
{\an3}JACKIE:
Dylan called, honey.

23:13.308 --> 23:14.559
Who cares?

23:17.312 --> 23:18.438
(door slams)

23:24.402 --> 23:26.988
So, I'm dying to know,
how'd the session go?

23:27.072 --> 23:29.199
I didn't get the stupid picture
taken, okay?

23:29.282 --> 23:30.659
{\an1}After all that work
we went through?

23:30.742 --> 23:32.661
You went through.

23:32.744 --> 23:33.662
{\an3}I just sat there,
hating every minute of it.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.997
{\an1}Then you should have
said something.

23:36.081 --> 23:38.834
I couldn't, you were too
busy putting my hair up

23:38.917 --> 23:40.210
and criticizing my makeup.

23:40.293 --> 23:41.837
I did nothing
of the kind.

23:41.920 --> 23:42.671
Yeah, but you
I saididn't mean it.rfect.

23:42.754 --> 23:45.006
You nKelly?!an it.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.842
You know, when I was 12,
it was

23:46.925 --> 23:48.343
"Of course you're pretty,
honey bun,

23:48.426 --> 23:50.011
but let's see if Weight Watchers
can do the trick."

23:50.095 --> 23:51.680
We're back to
And when I turned 15,

23:51.763 --> 23:53.014
you didn't get me a cake
like a normal mom,

23:53.098 --> 23:54.975
You begged me for it!.

23:55.058 --> 23:56.518
Only after you
told me I needed it.

23:56.601 --> 23:57.853
That is absolutely not true.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.521
{\an1}From the time you were
old enough to read,

23:59.604 --> 24:01.231
all you could talk about
was beauty and fashion.

24:01.314 --> 24:02.858
That is because that's
all you ever talked about,

24:02.941 --> 24:05.485
when you weren't passed out,
or out picking up one-nighters.

24:05.569 --> 24:06.862
Okay, I'm a terrible human being
and I've ruined your life.

24:06.945 --> 24:08.655
No, I don't want
to hear anything.

24:08.738 --> 24:10.824
WFine, then I will shut up.

24:10.907 --> 24:12.284
{\an3}But first I want to
thank you for teaching me

24:12.367 --> 24:12.993
{\an3}how to be shallow
and insincere.

24:13.076 --> 24:14.995
{\an1}Why are you trying
to hurt me?

24:15.078 --> 24:16.955
{\an3}Oh, God, I am so
sick of everything,

24:17.038 --> 24:18.874
You are screaming.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.167
Yeah, and it's about time.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.877
Kelly, get back here.
Where are you going?

24:31.803 --> 24:32.596
Brandon, hi.
How are you?

24:32.679 --> 24:34.639
{\an3}Fine. Late. Crazed.
How are you?

24:34.723 --> 24:36.600
{\an1}Okay, I know this is going
to sound a little weird,

24:36.683 --> 24:39.019
but I need to borrow $50.

24:39.102 --> 24:39.769
CINDY:
Brandon...!

24:39.853 --> 24:41.396
Steve's here.

24:41.479 --> 24:43.190
I'll be right down, Mom.

24:43.273 --> 24:44.900
{\an1}Brandon, can't you
help me out?

24:44.983 --> 24:46.693
{\an3}Brenda, all I have in
the world is ten dollars.

24:46.776 --> 24:48.904
Thanks, but I need $50.

24:48.987 --> 24:49.905
Why?

24:49.988 --> 24:51.615
{\an1}Minnesota requires
a $50 deposit

24:51.698 --> 24:53.742
{\an1}before they'll process
an out-of-state application.

24:53.825 --> 24:57.746
So, why don't you just hit
Mom and Dad up for a check?

24:57.829 --> 24:59.623
{\an3}You haven't told them
you're applying there yet?

24:59.706 --> 25:02.042
{\an1}I just didn't want
to get into

25:02.125 --> 25:03.418
a big family powwow
over this thing...

25:03.501 --> 25:04.794
Well, eventually they're
going to find out, Bren.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.046
{\an3}When were you planning
on telling them?

25:06.129 --> 25:07.422
{\an3}After you'd already
been accepted?

25:07.505 --> 25:08.965
{\an1}I just haven't found
a good time to bring it up.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.759
Well, now is definitely
not a good time, okay.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.093
{\an3}Because Dad is not
even home yet,

25:12.177 --> 25:13.178
and we're already
late for the game.

25:13.261 --> 25:15.805
{\an1}The application has to be
postmarked before midnight.

25:15.889 --> 25:16.806
You're killing me, Bren.

25:16.890 --> 25:20.268
Do you think Steve
would lend me $50?

25:22.520 --> 25:24.105
He just pulled in.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.273
Good.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.275
Sorry, I'm late.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.401
I got waylaid at the office.

25:28.485 --> 25:29.945
It's okay, honey. No rush.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.738
Yeah, no rush, who wants to be
there for the opening tip-off?

25:31.821 --> 25:34.741
{\an1}Hey, hey, hey, I know
a great shortcut, okay?

25:34.824 --> 25:35.700
Hey, Dad, let's go.

25:35.784 --> 25:38.286
I'll be down in two seconds.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.537
Fine.

25:42.040 --> 25:42.832
You want to have a little
something to eat before we go?

25:42.916 --> 25:46.628
{\an3}Yeah. Your Mom made
fresh fruit cups.

25:46.711 --> 25:47.796
No thanks, Mom.

25:47.879 --> 25:50.632
I think we'll just get a
couple dogs at the game.

25:50.715 --> 25:51.758
{\an3}If we ever get
to the game.

25:51.841 --> 25:52.842
{\an1}He'll be down
in two seconds.

25:53.718 --> 25:56.680
{\an3}(knocking)

25:56.763 --> 25:57.806
Dad?

25:57.889 --> 25:58.974
Hi, honey.

25:59.057 --> 26:00.767
Can I talk to you
for two seconds?

26:00.850 --> 26:02.811
I'd like to apply to the
University of Minnesota.

26:05.063 --> 26:08.817
{\an4}JIM:
Cindy, can you please come
up here for two seconds?

26:08.900 --> 26:11.111
I'll just be two seconds.

26:11.194 --> 26:13.655
Two seconds,
two seconds,

26:13.738 --> 26:14.739
{\an3}what is two seconds,
Walsh-speak for an eternity?

26:14.823 --> 26:17.492
Steve, it only takes
20 minutes to get to the Forum.

26:17.575 --> 26:19.995
We've got plenty of
Man...o get there.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.038
(car horns honking)

26:22.122 --> 26:23.832
Come on, damn it!

26:23.915 --> 26:25.000
Jim, relax.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.835
Hell of a shortcut.

26:26.918 --> 26:28.712
{\an3}Shut up, will ya? We're in
a family crisis, okay?

26:28.795 --> 26:31.464
{\an3}I'm just so fed
up with her.

26:31.548 --> 26:34.509
How could she spring this on us
at the last minute like this?

26:34.592 --> 26:36.011
{\an3}Are we that
unapproachable?

26:36.094 --> 26:37.345
{\an3}We're her parents,
for God's sake.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.514
She's just keeping
her options open.

26:39.597 --> 26:41.349
An option that's

26:41.433 --> 26:42.892
{\an1}2,000 miles
away from us.

26:42.976 --> 26:44.978
Honey, don't take
it so personally.

26:45.061 --> 26:45.854
All she heard growing up

26:45.937 --> 26:47.981
{\an1}was what a fabulous
school Minnesota was.

26:48.064 --> 26:50.650
(car horn blaring)

26:50.734 --> 26:51.860
{\an3}Every
lousy driver

26:51.943 --> 26:53.361
{\an3}in Los Angeles is on
the road tonight.

26:53.445 --> 26:56.489
Maybe we should go back.

26:56.573 --> 26:57.741
{\an1}JIM:
No, no, no.

26:57.824 --> 26:59.659
We're almost there.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.369
{\an1}And besides, don't they have
a big show at half-time?

27:01.453 --> 27:04.914
{\an1}Uh, that's football,
Mrs. Walsh.

27:04.998 --> 27:07.042
Oh.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.002
{\an1}You're definitely
sitting next to her.

27:17.927 --> 27:20.388
Steve, great seats!

27:20.472 --> 27:22.599
Oh, thanks a lot.

27:22.682 --> 27:23.892
Oh man, the game's already
in the refrigerator.

27:23.975 --> 27:25.518
{\an5}BRANDON:
Yeah, and that's where
I'm going to put you

27:25.602 --> 27:26.603
{\an1}if you don't
chill out, okay?

27:26.686 --> 27:27.437
Who sits where?

27:27.520 --> 27:28.772
Why don't you just
sit there, Mom?

27:28.855 --> 27:30.398
{\an1}Steve likes to sit
on the aisle.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.067
Well, don't you want to
sit next to your father?

27:32.150 --> 27:35.028
{\an1}No, no, that's okay. I'd much
rather sit next to you.

27:35.111 --> 27:37.405
{\an3}Excuse me, is
this your seat?

27:37.489 --> 27:39.282
(laughing):
No. This is his seat.

27:39.366 --> 27:40.575
<i>This</i> is my seat.

27:40.658 --> 27:41.743
{\an3}Okay.

27:41.826 --> 27:42.160
Congratulations.

27:42.243 --> 27:43.036
Before the game,

27:43.119 --> 27:45.955
seat number GG 35 was
picked at random

27:46.039 --> 27:50.627
{\an3}to try to make a half-court
shot at half-time for $10,000.

27:50.710 --> 27:52.921
(laughter, whooping)

27:53.004 --> 27:54.297
Go for it, son!

27:54.381 --> 27:56.299
But I'll need to see
your ticket stub first.

27:56.383 --> 27:57.967
Yeah, sure.

27:58.051 --> 28:01.262
There it is...

28:01.346 --> 28:06.142
{\an3}I'm sorry.
I need GG 35.

28:06.226 --> 28:07.602
{\an3}JIM:
We've got it.

28:07.685 --> 28:08.269
BYSTANDER:
He's got the wrong ticket.

28:08.353 --> 28:12.148
G... GG 35!
Buddy, buddy!

28:12.232 --> 28:14.776
I've been waiting all
my life for this shot!

28:14.859 --> 28:15.985
Go get 'em brother.

28:18.988 --> 28:22.867
CHEERLEADERS:
Go... go... Lakers!

28:28.039 --> 28:28.915
Hey.

28:28.998 --> 28:31.418
{\an3}Man, I'm glad
to see you.

28:31.501 --> 28:32.961
Dude, are you psyched?

28:33.044 --> 28:34.337
{\an3}Psyched? I'm a little freaked
out, thank you very much.

28:34.421 --> 28:35.463
Hey, Steve, you
got to relax, man.

28:35.547 --> 28:36.381
I'm trying to relax.

28:36.464 --> 28:38.466
I've never been any
good under pressure.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.968
{\an5}Oh, don't worry about it.
Nobody expect you to hit
a basket from half-court.

28:40.051 --> 28:42.846
{\an3}Are you kidding? These
people are brutal out here!

28:42.929 --> 28:44.973
{\an3}You make one air ball,
and they boo you.

28:45.056 --> 28:47.308
{\an1}Okay, you're up
in about four minutes.

28:47.392 --> 28:50.311
{\an1}Why don't we go out
and loosen up.

28:50.395 --> 28:51.771
{\an3}The worse part
of this whole thing

28:51.855 --> 28:53.648
is seeing
Jack Nicholson going...

28:54.065 --> 28:55.984
Come on Buddy,
you're not going to choke.

28:56.067 --> 28:57.986
Listen, if I die
of embarrassment,

28:58.069 --> 29:00.321
tell my mother I love her.

29:00.405 --> 29:01.114
Come back with a check
for ten grand,

29:01.197 --> 29:03.158
you can tell her
yourself, okay?

29:06.077 --> 29:08.037
All right, go for it!

29:08.121 --> 29:09.038
{\an1}Ten grand!
Ten grand!

29:09.122 --> 29:11.374
{\an1}You think he'll hit
the backboard?

29:11.458 --> 29:13.209
{\an3}Eight-to-one he
throws up a brick.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.503
I thought we'd quit gambling.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.005
We did.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.965
Brandon, wait a minute.

29:19.048 --> 29:21.843
{\an3}Did your sister tell you she
was applying to Minnesota?

29:21.926 --> 29:24.804
{\an1}Yeah, but she didn't
exactly confide in me.

29:24.888 --> 29:26.014
{\an3}Hmm. If she hadn't
needed a check,

29:26.097 --> 29:29.350
{\an3}I don't know when we would
have heard about it.

29:29.434 --> 29:32.604
She just didn't want you to read
too much into it, that's all.

29:32.687 --> 29:35.190
{\an3}I know, but that doesn't
mean she has to shut us out.

29:35.273 --> 29:38.026
You know, you and your sister
are going to be 18 this summer.

29:38.109 --> 29:40.028
{\an3}You're going to be making
a lot of decisions

29:40.111 --> 29:43.364
that your mother and I might
not necessarily agree with,

29:43.448 --> 29:46.993
{\an3}but that doesn't mean we're
going to turn on you.

29:47.076 --> 29:49.204
Let's go watch Steve.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.581
Uh, Dad...

29:51.664 --> 29:54.000
{\an3}I don't quite know how
to tell you this...

29:54.083 --> 29:57.045
{\an3}but, uh, the whole sports
betting thing...

29:58.421 --> 30:01.090
{\an3}I really didn't quit
when I was ahead.

30:01.174 --> 30:04.219
{\an3}I actually got into a little
trouble with a bookie.

30:04.302 --> 30:05.261
A little trouble?

30:05.345 --> 30:07.931
Actually, it was
a lot of trouble.

30:08.014 --> 30:10.350
Nat had to bail me out.

30:10.433 --> 30:11.976
(sighs)

30:12.060 --> 30:14.729
Great, you can't
talk to me either?

30:14.812 --> 30:16.231
No, I can. I just...

30:16.314 --> 30:18.942
{\an3}I just didn't want you
to know I was screwing up.

30:19.025 --> 30:23.571
{\an1}Brandon, no matter
how bad you screw up,

30:23.655 --> 30:25.907
you're still my only son,

30:25.990 --> 30:28.076
and don't you ever forget that,

30:28.159 --> 30:31.037
{\an1}or I'll have to whip your butt
in a game of one-on-one.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.456
Okay, I'm sorry.

30:33.540 --> 30:36.042
We'll talk about it later.

30:36.125 --> 30:38.086
Right now, we'd better
not miss Steve's shot.

30:38.169 --> 30:41.089
{\an3}He'd never forgive
either of us.

30:41.172 --> 30:44.467
{\an5}(over speaker)
Good evening ladies and
gentlemen, this is Chick Hearn,

30:44.551 --> 30:46.427
and it's time now
for our half-court shot.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.888
This evening, we have
Steve Sanders at mid court,

30:48.972 --> 30:50.932
and if Steve can make this shot,

30:51.015 --> 30:55.979
he'll walk away with a suitcase
full of money-- $10,000.

31:00.149 --> 31:01.276
Yay, Steve!

31:01.359 --> 31:03.820
Yes! Go for it!

31:11.035 --> 31:12.620
Go for it!

31:14.163 --> 31:17.375
Oh great, Dyan Cannon.
Come on...

31:24.048 --> 31:26.009
(ball dribbles)

31:30.221 --> 31:33.975
{\an1}SPECTATOR:
Air ball!

31:45.945 --> 31:47.363
Yahoo!

31:49.574 --> 31:51.451
HEARN:
What a shot!

31:51.534 --> 31:52.035
Ladies and gentlemen,
Steve Sanders

31:52.118 --> 31:56.664
has just won $10,000!

31:56.748 --> 32:01.002
Steve, when you decide to turn
pro, you let us know.

32:03.630 --> 32:06.799
{\an3}Yes! Go!

32:09.969 --> 32:12.347
I can't believe it!

32:16.601 --> 32:18.311
DAVID:
<i>I mean, I've lived with Kelly</i>

32:18.394 --> 32:21.064
{\an3}for awhile now,
and she can get moody,

32:21.147 --> 32:23.524
but I've never heard
her get that upset.

32:23.608 --> 32:26.361
{\an5}I mean, Jackie hasn't
come out of her room
since Kelly took off.

32:26.444 --> 32:27.362
I feel bad for Jackie,

32:27.445 --> 32:30.698
'cause it's not her that
Kelly's mad at, it's me.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.367
But she's definitely
down on Jackie, too.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.035
She had a few things
on her mind lately.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.161
Well, it's nice to feel

32:35.244 --> 32:37.163
like you can take care
of everything yourself,

32:37.246 --> 32:39.165
{\an3}but I still feel Kelly
was better off

32:39.248 --> 32:41.751
{\an3}staying in that
eating disorder group.

32:41.834 --> 32:42.877
What group?

32:42.960 --> 32:43.294
She didn't tell you about it?

32:43.378 --> 32:44.253
No, she didn't.

32:44.337 --> 32:47.423
(sighs)

32:47.507 --> 32:49.008
I didn't know it was a secret.

32:49.092 --> 32:51.010
Neither did I, David.

32:51.094 --> 32:52.720
Listen man, I thought
about going after her,

32:52.804 --> 32:53.888
but I felt that if

32:53.971 --> 32:56.683
{\an6}I were that worked up,
I'd just want to
be left alone.

32:56.766 --> 32:58.393
My guess is she went
down to the beach.

32:58.476 --> 33:04.065
No, I don't think
that's where she went.

33:10.446 --> 33:13.991
<i>Hmm. The old playground.</i>

33:17.328 --> 33:20.415
I knew you'd be here.

33:20.498 --> 33:24.210
I used to push you
on this same swing.

33:24.293 --> 33:26.087
So you could look
up my dress.

33:26.170 --> 33:30.717
That wasn't me.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.928
{\an3}Kel, I remember the time
you jumped off this thing.

33:34.011 --> 33:37.515
{\an6}You skinned your knee,
but you didn't want
anyone to see you cry,

33:37.598 --> 33:40.601
{\an3}so you just stood there
bleeding, trying to smile.

33:43.438 --> 33:47.608
{\an3}It's not that easy
anymore, Dylan.

33:47.692 --> 33:51.779
So why don't you just do me and
everybody else a big favor

33:51.863 --> 33:53.865
and go back to Brenda?

33:53.948 --> 33:55.867
Is that really
what you want?

33:55.950 --> 33:57.285
{\an1}It doesn't matter
what I really want.

33:57.368 --> 34:00.955
{\an1}I'm just a stupid
blonde bitch

34:01.038 --> 34:02.290
I disagree.eally worth it.

34:02.373 --> 34:06.544
Then why don't you
talk to my father,

34:06.627 --> 34:09.922
who never bothers
to call me anymore.

34:10.005 --> 34:12.967
Or my mom, who probably
hates me right now.

34:13.050 --> 34:15.011
{\an1}(laughs)
Or all the guys

34:15.094 --> 34:17.388
I put out for in the tenth grade
and never heard from again.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.599
{\an1}Or why don't you
talk to Brenda

34:19.681 --> 34:21.516
and find out how it really feels

34:21.601 --> 34:24.270
to have somebody you trust
go behind your back

34:24.353 --> 34:26.272
and steal your boyfriend
from you.

34:26.355 --> 34:27.857
That's not how it happened.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.275
That's not even close, Kel.

34:29.358 --> 34:30.275
That's part of what
I've been writing about.

34:32.360 --> 34:35.864
{\an1}(laughing):
Yes.

34:35.947 --> 34:39.827
{\an1}Thank you for reminding me
about that.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.121
Kelly, do you have any idea

34:42.205 --> 34:44.373
how difficult it is for me
to share that with anybody?

34:44.456 --> 34:47.627
{\an1}You're not the only one
who wants to end up

34:47.710 --> 34:50.505
{\an1}as more than just Best
Looking in the stupid poll.

34:50.588 --> 34:53.299
You are already so much more
than that, and you know it.

34:53.382 --> 34:55.676
How do I know it?

34:55.760 --> 34:57.970
Who ever tells me that I'm smart
or even worth knowing?

34:58.054 --> 34:59.388
{\an1}We are

34:59.472 --> 35:01.849
two little kids
who had to walk home

35:01.933 --> 35:03.392
from school by ourselves,

35:03.476 --> 35:05.937
{\an1}because our parents
forgot to pick us up.

35:06.020 --> 35:07.480
I guess we're both basket cases.

35:07.563 --> 35:09.232
No...

35:09.315 --> 35:10.316
we're soul mates.

35:12.318 --> 35:14.862
I-If you hadn't called me
that day at the marina,

35:14.946 --> 35:16.697
<i>I</i> would've fried in that car.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.282
And I miss Jack--
I miss him...

35:18.366 --> 35:21.285
I miss him more than
I can tell you, but I'm not...

35:21.369 --> 35:23.037
I'm not unhappy to be alive.

35:23.120 --> 35:26.165
And most of my life,
I couldn't say that.

35:26.249 --> 35:27.875
I care what you think.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.210
I don't care that you're in
an eating disorder group, Kel.

35:29.293 --> 35:33.047
If you said that you never
wanted to sleep with me again,

35:33.130 --> 35:34.090
I could live with that.

35:36.092 --> 35:40.096
That morning when
I called you on the boat...

35:40.179 --> 35:44.851
{\an5}(sighs)
all I really wanted to do
was hear your voice.

35:44.934 --> 35:46.978
Do you still want to?

35:48.062 --> 35:49.063
Yes.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.044
Hi, honey.

36:12.128 --> 36:14.422
Hi. Who won?

36:14.505 --> 36:15.506
{\an3}St(laughs)

36:15.590 --> 36:18.718
{\an3}He won $10,000 for sinking
a basket at halftime.

36:18.801 --> 36:20.094
$10,000? You're kidding.

36:20.177 --> 36:22.096
The Where is he?her.

36:22.179 --> 36:24.974
Oh, he and Brandon went down
to the Peach Pit to celebrate.

36:25.057 --> 36:26.601
{\an3}Why don't you go
down and join them?

36:26.684 --> 36:28.394
No, I think I'll just
stay here and read.

36:30.479 --> 36:32.398
Listen, honey...

36:32.481 --> 36:35.484
we know this has been
a rough time for you,

36:35.568 --> 36:38.988
{\an5}and... I mean, the last
thing we want to do is
to make it any rougher.

36:39.071 --> 36:41.073
And obviously,
you didn't feel comfortable

36:41.157 --> 36:43.075
talking to us about it, and...

36:43.159 --> 36:44.452
frankly, we feel
a little left out.

36:44.535 --> 36:47.830
{\an1}Look, I'm sorry,
but it's really no big deal.

36:47.914 --> 36:50.833
{\an1}I just feel more and more
like my real friends

36:50.917 --> 36:53.878
Well, you have real
arfriends here, too.a.

36:53.961 --> 36:56.088
Mom, I know, but it's different.

36:56.172 --> 36:57.465
{\an1}Back there, people
liked me for who I was,

36:57.548 --> 37:00.092
not what I looked like.

37:00.176 --> 37:02.094
{\an1}I don't know, somehow
it's not the same.

37:02.178 --> 37:04.972
Are you sorry we moved here?

37:05.056 --> 37:06.974
{\an1}No. I'm just
beginning to realize

37:07.058 --> 37:09.936
{\an1}that maybe I'm more Minnesota
than Beverly Hills.

37:10.019 --> 37:12.980
{\an6}(laughs)
Well, I think we all
feel that way sometimes.

37:13.064 --> 37:16.484
And as far as college goes, I...
I think your mom and I agree

37:16.567 --> 37:18.319
that... well,
it's probably smart that

37:18.402 --> 37:20.446
you keep your
options open.

37:20.529 --> 37:23.032
Well, while you guys were
at the game, I mailed in

37:23.115 --> 37:24.492
Good for you.n.

37:24.575 --> 37:27.662
And whether it's California or
Minnesota, we think either state

37:27.745 --> 37:28.412
{\an3}would be lucky
to have you.

37:35.753 --> 37:37.463
(door opens)

37:45.429 --> 37:47.848
So, do I still have a mom?

37:47.932 --> 37:49.934
Oh, baby.

37:52.269 --> 37:54.188
{\an3}Of course,

37:54.271 --> 37:56.273
of course.

37:57.566 --> 38:03.322
{\an6}(crying):
Not that I've been
much good to you.

38:03.406 --> 38:06.158
Kelly...

38:06.242 --> 38:10.162
{\an3}I'm so sorry for everything
I've put you through.

38:10.246 --> 38:13.416
Mom, it's not like
everything was bad.

38:13.499 --> 38:17.211
I... I just...

38:17.294 --> 38:20.297
wish I could
turn back the clock.

38:23.134 --> 38:26.012
{\an1}You were the one
good thing in my life,

38:26.095 --> 38:29.890
and like a selfish idiot,

38:29.974 --> 38:33.060
{\an1}I just kept
getting high and...

38:33.144 --> 38:35.271
running around and...

38:35.354 --> 38:37.606
{\an1}doing anything
but being a loving mom.

38:37.690 --> 38:41.068
{\an3}Well, you did the
best you could.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.904
{\an1}When I see you
beating yourself up...

38:43.988 --> 38:47.283
{\an1}I feel like
it's all my fault.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.369
{\an3}It can't be
all your fault--

38:50.453 --> 38:51.996
it's my life.

38:54.999 --> 38:59.253
{\an1}And I keep promising
things are gonna be different,

38:59.336 --> 39:00.755
and here we are,

39:00.838 --> 39:04.258
{\an1}me on my umpteenth
divorce and...

39:04.341 --> 39:07.303
you passing out
from diet pills.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.931
I was thinking,

39:11.015 --> 39:14.602
{\an3}maybe I should go back to
that eating disorder group.

39:14.685 --> 39:15.644
Maybe I could go with you.

39:15.728 --> 39:20.274
{\an1}Or maybe we could find
somebody to talk to about...

39:20.357 --> 39:23.110
{\an1}all the stuff we should've
dealt with years ago.

39:23.194 --> 39:27.281
I'd like to do
that with you.

39:27.364 --> 39:30.076
{\an3}I think it'd
be good for me.

39:30.159 --> 39:31.577
Me, too, honey.

39:31.660 --> 39:32.870
(laughs softly)

39:36.040 --> 39:37.166
Oh...

39:41.712 --> 39:43.297
STEVE:
<i>The basket looked</i>

39:43.380 --> 39:44.799
this big.

39:44.882 --> 39:45.508
What was it, uh, 70 feet?

39:45.591 --> 39:47.468
{\an3}170 feet, I
thought he said.

39:47.551 --> 39:51.180
{\an1}You guys,
just think about it.

39:51.263 --> 39:53.974
{\an1}What are the odds of <i> anyone</i>
making a shot like that?

39:54.058 --> 39:55.601
Mm, about the same as the odds

39:55.684 --> 39:59.355
of Celeste picking you over me
on that game show.

39:59.438 --> 40:01.982
Or the odds of Mrs. Teasley
writing you a glowing letter

40:02.066 --> 40:04.151
{\an3}of recommendation to the
California University.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.362
Or the odds of Hell
(Steve laughs)

40:06.445 --> 40:08.364
{\an1}You guys are all
missing the point.

40:08.447 --> 40:10.866
You see... it was my seat,

40:10.950 --> 40:14.829
it was <i> my</i> ticket stub,
it was <i> my</i> half-court shot, okay?

40:14.912 --> 40:15.830
All this on a night that

40:15.913 --> 40:18.833
{\an1}I thought would be
the biggest loser of all time.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.876
No offense.

40:20.960 --> 40:21.877
None taken.

40:21.961 --> 40:24.839
You see,
if I can make the shot,

40:24.922 --> 40:27.508
then it's got to be a sign,
like a new day or something.

40:27.591 --> 40:30.886
Like "Today is the first day
of the rest of your life"?

40:30.970 --> 40:33.722
And what are you gonna do for
the rest of your life, Steve?

40:33.806 --> 40:35.724
Well, one thing is for sure--
with these ten G's

40:35.808 --> 40:38.144
burning a hole in my pocket,

40:38.227 --> 40:40.855
I sure as <i> hell</i> ain't gonna
be slinging burgers this year.

40:40.938 --> 40:42.356
{\an3}Like you
would've anyway.

40:42.439 --> 40:43.691
{\an5}BRANDON:
Wait a minute,
Andrea, I thought

40:43.774 --> 40:46.485
you were gonna be running
that summer camp

40:46.569 --> 40:48.904
for the kids from
AYep, so did I,.

40:48.988 --> 40:50.531
{\an1}but Mrs. Teasley
informed me

40:50.614 --> 40:52.741
{\an1}that the school district
has pulled the plug.

40:52.825 --> 40:54.535
You're kiMm-mm.

40:54.618 --> 40:57.037
Mm, that's too bad..

40:57.121 --> 40:58.205
Those little kids
made my year

40:58.289 --> 41:01.208
when I was playing Santa Claus
for 'em last Christmas.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.377
That's 'cause they got him
out of detention.

41:03.460 --> 41:04.795
So <i> that</i> was the angle.

41:04.879 --> 41:06.088
What angle?

41:06.172 --> 41:08.090
I did not do it for that.

41:08.174 --> 41:11.093
{\an1}Relax, Steve-- it is
just a part of your charm.

41:11.177 --> 41:12.136
It's your basic karma, man.

41:12.219 --> 41:13.596
(forced chuckle)
All I could say is,

41:13.679 --> 41:16.557
ten years from now,
when you all have forgotten

41:16.640 --> 41:19.226
{\an3}what you won
You will have forgotten

41:19.310 --> 41:20.603
{\an3}what you blew
the ten G's on.

41:20.686 --> 41:22.605
Don't be so sure about that.

41:22.688 --> 41:25.107
{\an3}So what are you gonna
do with the money?

41:27.318 --> 41:30.112
I'm gonna spend it
all in one place.

41:32.823 --> 41:34.200
(laughs)

41:34.283 --> 41:36.035
(bell ringing)

41:36.118 --> 41:38.454
It was the strangest thing--
a messenger dropped off

41:38.537 --> 41:40.456
a certified check for $10,000,

41:40.539 --> 41:42.917
{\an1}payable to the Alvarado
Street Summer Camp.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.752
I can't believe it!

41:44.835 --> 41:46.921
So, Counselor,
you're back in business.

41:47.004 --> 41:48.923
{\an3}Oh, Mrs. Teasley, I
mean, this is amazing.

41:49.006 --> 41:51.383
That's the strange part.

41:51.467 --> 41:52.927
{\an1}The donor wished
to remain anonymous.

41:53.010 --> 41:56.597
{\an6}You know, you hear
about stuff like this--
a pure, unselfish gift.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.766
{\an3}Aren't you dying
to know who did it?

41:58.849 --> 42:00.142
Someone with $10,000.

42:00.226 --> 42:02.645
{\an3}I guess Santa Claus came
early this ye(laughs)

42:02.728 --> 42:06.232
(stops laughing)

42:11.153 --> 42:11.862
Nah.

42:26.043 --> 42:28.045
Your photographer awaits.

42:29.713 --> 42:32.216
You sure? 'Cause
we don't have to.

42:32.299 --> 42:34.426
{\an1}Zuckerman says we could
eliminate the whole category,

42:34.510 --> 42:36.971
and the world would be
a better place for it.

42:37.054 --> 42:38.264
No, I want to.

42:38.347 --> 42:40.849
{\an3}No tuxedos,
though, jusOkay.

42:40.933 --> 42:42.768
{\an1}Um, Kelly,

42:42.851 --> 42:45.688
{\an1}there's something
I want you to read.

42:45.771 --> 42:46.689
You don't have to.

42:46.772 --> 42:48.941
I know. I want to, though.

42:49.024 --> 42:51.694
{\an1}It's a, uh, first draft;
it's not finished.

42:51.777 --> 42:55.406
Well, I'll try not
to be too critical.

42:57.241 --> 42:59.159
"Dedicated to Kelly Taylor."

43:01.412 --> 43:03.330
So far I like it a lot.

43:06.292 --> 43:08.502
STEVE:
<i>The usher calls my seat.</i>

43:08.585 --> 43:09.837
{\an3}Instantly, I
was transformed

43:09.920 --> 43:10.796
{\an3}into a seven-foot-two
basketball player.

43:10.879 --> 43:13.132
{\an3}I walk down
on that court,

43:13.215 --> 43:14.842
{\an3}masquerading around in
my own little aura energy.

43:14.925 --> 43:17.386
{\an3}There was the basket,
no bigger than a pinhead.

43:17.469 --> 43:18.846
{\an3}Brenda, you haven't
heard this.

43:18.929 --> 43:20.848
{\an1}Yes, I did, Steve,
and congratulations.

43:20.931 --> 43:23.851
{\an6}No, he means you
haven't heard the
Sanders play-by-play.

43:23.934 --> 43:24.852
It's interminable.

43:24.935 --> 43:26.812
(sighs)
Do you haNo!a second?

43:26.895 --> 43:31.191
Brenda is my friend, and I will
not let you bore her to death.

43:31.275 --> 43:33.694
{\an1}Donna, actually,
I'd like to hear it.

43:33.777 --> 43:35.362
Okay.

43:35.446 --> 43:36.739
Thank you. There I was,
I walked out on the court,

43:36.822 --> 43:38.824
the picture of calmness--
I was cool, I was mellow.

43:38.907 --> 43:41.994
It was a Zen thing.
I had the ball in my hand.

43:42.077 --> 43:43.871
I wanted to breathe
through my eyes...

43:43.954 --> 43:47.082
{\an5}DYLAN:
<i>Even before he noticed her,</i>
<i>he noticed her boat,</i>

43:47.166 --> 43:49.585
<i>a sleek two-footer</i>
<i>she had been given</i>

43:49.668 --> 43:52.129
<i>for her fifth birthday</i>
<i>a few days before.</i>

43:52.212 --> 43:53.964
<i>She was sailing it, upside down</i>

43:54.048 --> 43:57.718
<i>in a large pool that had formed</i>
<i>during a winter rain.</i>

43:57.801 --> 44:01.055
<i>The rain, again.</i>

44:01.138 --> 44:03.015
<i>In a marina this time.</i>

44:03.098 --> 44:05.893
<i>The boats, like the girl,</i>
<i>had grown.</i>

44:05.976 --> 44:08.937
<i>Beautiful, inspirational.</i>

44:09.021 --> 44:12.191
<i>After the explosion</i>
<i>that killed his father,</i>

44:12.274 --> 44:15.569
<i>she was the only beauty,</i>
<i>the only inspiration,</i>

44:15.652 --> 44:18.113
<i>left in his life.</i>

44:20.866 --> 44:25.120
{\an3}Dylan, did you mean
what you said yesterday?

44:25.204 --> 44:26.955
{\an1}We said a lot
of things, Kel.

44:27.039 --> 44:30.918
{\an3}The part about how if we
never slept together again

44:31.001 --> 44:32.920
you could live with that?

44:33.003 --> 44:33.796
Are you sure I said that?

44:33.879 --> 44:36.006
{\an1}I mean, it just doesn't
sound like me.

44:36.090 --> 44:38.175
BOY:
All righty.

44:38.258 --> 44:39.593
Here we go. Smile.

44:42.721 --> 44:43.764
(shutter clicks)
