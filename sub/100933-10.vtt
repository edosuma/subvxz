00:01.120 --> 00:03.420
Previously on "Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

00:04.960 --> 00:06.330
Kora, you don't
have to die today.

00:06.330 --> 00:08.000
How'd you know
I was gonna be out here?

00:08.000 --> 00:09.620
I have my new friend,
Sibyl, to thank for that.

00:09.620 --> 00:11.670
I was actually
supposed to die, too,

00:11.670 --> 00:13.620
but I found
an escape hatch.

00:13.620 --> 00:14.790
You want to come along?

00:14.790 --> 00:16.880
That woman --
what did you do to her?

00:18.500 --> 00:19.830
She's none
of your concern.

00:19.830 --> 00:21.960
I only wanted
what was best for you.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.040
There's only fear
in your eyes.

00:23.040 --> 00:24.710
You don't see anything
but a threat.

00:24.710 --> 00:26.790
No. I love you.
I've always loved you.

00:26.790 --> 00:28.540
You were gonna let him
put a knife through my heart!

00:28.540 --> 00:30.920
Li, no! Stop!

00:33.830 --> 00:35.540
I can't leave my people
behind to die.

00:35.540 --> 00:36.830
My daughter
is still out there.

00:36.830 --> 00:38.580
We won't let you
fight this battle alone.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.080
We'll send coordinates
to that watch

00:40.080 --> 00:41.620
when we're ready to meet.

00:41.620 --> 00:43.000
You should find someplace
to hide until then.

00:44.420 --> 00:47.000
This just feels right.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.920
I feel like we should give
the world something new.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.330
And what's that?

00:52.880 --> 00:54.120
Anarchy.

01:02.290 --> 01:04.580
Here you go.

01:04.580 --> 01:06.330
♪ You broke my car down ♪

01:06.330 --> 01:08.250
♪ I let my guard down ♪

01:08.250 --> 01:11.960
♪ You took my money,
and you ran away ♪

01:11.960 --> 01:13.960
♪ You left me stranded ♪

01:13.960 --> 01:15.620
♪ And I let you say ♪

01:15.620 --> 01:18.080
♪ Well, it's a cryin' shame ♪

01:18.080 --> 01:21.670
♪ It ain't a victim,
I'm in a high note ♪

01:21.670 --> 01:25.420
♪ I'm in the middle,
and I don't know why ♪

01:25.420 --> 01:29.000
♪ I ain't into teasin',
well, can't you see then ♪

01:29.000 --> 01:30.710
You care
for a challenge?

01:30.710 --> 01:32.040
Sure.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.250
A good challenge
makes life worth living.

01:34.250 --> 01:35.880
Sounds like
someone's a philosopher.

01:35.880 --> 01:38.750
That's pretty rare
for a S.H.I.E.L.D. hangout.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.420
I don't know
about all that,

01:40.420 --> 01:42.540
but I am
a damn good dart thrower.

01:42.540 --> 01:44.040
Fair warning.

01:44.040 --> 01:47.040
How about we add
a little wager? Make it fun?

01:47.040 --> 01:49.330
Oh, I'm not sure
I want to lose all my money

01:49.330 --> 01:50.830
to the hottest recruit.

01:50.830 --> 01:52.210
Hmm?

01:53.750 --> 01:57.380
Well, top test scores
and an ace pilot.

01:57.380 --> 02:01.460
You know, I need
a pilot on my team.

02:01.460 --> 02:04.040
I appreciate you
blowing smoke up my ass,

02:04.040 --> 02:05.540
but I don't think
we've met.

02:05.540 --> 02:07.000
We haven't.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.420
But I know a lot
about you.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.170
Like how your relationship
with S.H.I.E.L.D.

02:10.170 --> 02:13.670
is headed for
a very, very sad breakup.

02:13.670 --> 02:15.420
What the hell
are you talking about?

02:15.420 --> 02:18.540
Seven years from now,
in the Balkans,

02:18.540 --> 02:20.460
you get wounded
real ugly,

02:20.460 --> 02:23.380
lying there
with your guts out.

02:23.380 --> 02:26.170
You call for an extract,
but they refuse.

02:28.620 --> 02:29.920
You survive,

02:29.920 --> 02:33.000
but you and S.H.I.E.L.D.
are over with,

02:33.000 --> 02:35.080
and you fall right into
the loving arms of Hydra.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.290
Wow.

02:38.290 --> 02:40.120
The future.

02:42.170 --> 02:43.750
Why don't I call
the psych ward

02:43.750 --> 02:45.960
and tell them
you wandered off?

02:50.330 --> 02:51.710
Damn.

02:54.830 --> 02:56.710
That's a neat trick.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.000
Yeah, that's called
a superpower.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.080
Would you like one?

03:06.170 --> 03:07.750
Sweetheart.

03:07.750 --> 03:09.380
Two more beers
on my tab.

03:09.380 --> 03:10.460
Okay.

03:10.460 --> 03:12.790
Under the name
John Garrett.

03:12.790 --> 03:15.540
-- Captions by VITAC --

03:20.000 --> 03:21.460
Mack:
Stuck in the 1980s.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.880
Used to have nostalgia
for them.

03:24.880 --> 03:27.000
That is very gone.

03:29.790 --> 03:32.120
Roxy.
It's good to see you.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.710
Likewise, sir.
Didn't expect you again so soon.

03:34.710 --> 03:38.250
Yeah, well,
couldn't be helped.

03:38.250 --> 03:41.000
I know you guys are up to
some top-secret stuff.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.790
The Lighthouse is all yours.
Control is up and running.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.290
Wish I could
hang with you.

03:45.290 --> 03:46.750
Congrats on
getting into the Academy.

03:46.750 --> 03:48.420
Thanks. Yeah.

03:48.420 --> 03:50.830
I thought I was in S.H.I.E.L.D.,
but it turns out

03:50.830 --> 03:53.250
Deke wasn't authorized
to make me an agent.

03:53.250 --> 03:54.420
Mack: Mm-hmm.

03:54.420 --> 03:56.040
Rest of the gang
signed up, too.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.210
Maybe we'll be reunited
at the Triskelion

03:58.210 --> 03:59.290
after we graduate.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.170
Hey.

04:02.170 --> 04:04.540
You're not in a TV anymore,
Coulson.

04:04.540 --> 04:05.580
That's cool.

04:05.580 --> 04:06.960
Just don't ask me
to explain it.

04:08.170 --> 04:10.580
Well, duty calls.

04:10.580 --> 04:11.670
Good luck, Agent Glass.

04:16.880 --> 04:20.540
She mentioned the Triskelion,
but it's 1983.

04:20.540 --> 04:22.080
Wasn't in use yet.

04:22.080 --> 04:23.880
It's ahead of schedule.

04:23.880 --> 04:26.000
Just like
Project Insight.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.380
What are you thinking?

04:27.380 --> 04:28.540
Well,
you're the Director --

04:28.540 --> 04:30.710
No, enough with
the formalities.

04:30.710 --> 04:33.920
We're dead in the water here.
I need you to be you.

04:33.920 --> 04:36.330
So if you have a mission
for us, let us know.

04:36.330 --> 04:37.830
Timeline's coming apart.

04:37.830 --> 04:40.170
We have to put it back.

04:40.170 --> 04:41.580
Nathaniel Malick's
out there

04:41.580 --> 04:44.040
with quake powers
and a new base.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.500
You made a promise
to Daisy's mom

04:45.500 --> 04:46.670
that she wouldn't
have to fight him alone.

04:50.380 --> 04:52.620
I think it's time
to keep that promise.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.250
Sousa: Wow.

05:03.210 --> 05:05.290
Well, consider me
impressed.

05:05.290 --> 05:07.540
A multi-story base
under a lighthouse?

05:07.540 --> 05:09.290
Daisy: Yeah, we've just spent
a lot of time down here,

05:09.290 --> 05:12.040
so maybe we're over it.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.960
Any idea why
the new countdown didn't start

05:16.960 --> 05:18.380
after we fixed the Drive?

05:18.380 --> 05:20.920
Uh, the electrochron
displacement mechanism

05:20.920 --> 05:23.380
did stabilize it, but it is
possible the cumulative damage

05:23.380 --> 05:25.120
severed our operative
transmission receiver's ability

05:25.120 --> 05:26.960
to penetrate space-time.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.580
Did you understand that?

05:28.580 --> 05:31.380
Actually, yes.
I did.

05:31.380 --> 05:32.920
I'm gonna grab
some rest.

05:32.920 --> 05:34.250
Uh, the bunks are
down that way.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.420
Can I take that
off your hands?

05:35.420 --> 05:37.170
Um, I got it.
Thanks.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.670
Just thought I'd put some weight
on the new leg, is all.

05:39.670 --> 05:41.210
O...kay.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.290
Thank you.

05:50.210 --> 05:51.250
What?

05:51.250 --> 05:52.960
Say what you will
about the '50s.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.250
At least he doesn't know
chivalry is dead.

05:57.210 --> 05:59.170
Okay, anyway...

05:59.170 --> 06:02.830
I wish you'd pulled a solution
for this out of my head.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.960
I need Fitz's brain now --
wherever it is.

06:05.960 --> 06:09.540
So, you don't remember anything
about where you guys were?

06:09.540 --> 06:11.790
No.
That's the point.

06:11.790 --> 06:16.500
What was the last thing
that you...do remember?

06:16.500 --> 06:18.290
You were being hunted
by Chronicoms,

06:18.290 --> 06:20.790
but did it ever
get...violent?

06:20.790 --> 06:22.460
Why are you asking?

06:22.460 --> 06:25.500
Did I say something
when you removed the implant?

06:25.500 --> 06:26.500
Not exactly.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.040
Daisy,
I don't want to know.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.040
I thought we agreed --
no information was
supposed to come out.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.210
I don't have
any information. I --

06:32.250 --> 06:35.330
You couldn't
control yourself.

06:35.330 --> 06:37.960
No matter how confused
I was, I can't know --

06:37.960 --> 06:40.120
You were not confused.
You were...

06:40.120 --> 06:42.250
You were devastated.

06:42.250 --> 06:43.790
I've never seen you
so freaked.

06:43.790 --> 06:45.460
Y-Y-You were inconsolable.

06:48.620 --> 06:50.540
That's why I asked.

06:50.540 --> 06:53.080
Mack: Johnson, Simmons,
report to Control.

07:03.380 --> 07:05.120
Mack: We're not waiting
on a broken clock.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.290
We're gonna do
something.

07:06.290 --> 07:07.750
Even if we could
leave this time,

07:07.750 --> 07:09.880
leaving this Malick
unleashed on the world

07:09.880 --> 07:11.670
could have
irreparable consequences.

07:11.670 --> 07:14.210
He's taken control of Afterlife.
We have to take it back.

07:14.210 --> 07:16.000
Starting with
his hostages.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.670
And protecting Jiaying
at all costs.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.670
Simmons, can you send
our coordinates to her watch?

07:19.670 --> 07:21.040
On it.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.500
Uh...
I-I-I don't think

07:22.500 --> 07:24.500
it's a good idea
to bring her here.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.460
I hear you, but we can't lose
any more parents.

07:26.460 --> 07:28.420
This is about
protecting your existence.

07:28.420 --> 07:30.620
Aside from May and Yo-Yo,
Jiaying doesn't know us.

07:30.620 --> 07:32.750
We could minimize
what we tell her.

07:32.750 --> 07:35.460
Nothing about her future,
her power, or you, her --

07:35.460 --> 07:36.790
Daughter?

07:38.460 --> 07:39.460
May:

07:39.460 --> 07:42.040
Um, Daisy,
there's, uh...

07:42.040 --> 07:43.420
one other thing.

07:43.420 --> 07:45.250
At Afterlife,
there was a woman who --

07:47.000 --> 07:49.420
That was fast.

07:49.420 --> 07:51.120
He's hunting us.

07:54.830 --> 07:56.290
Nathaniel:
They call it Afterlife.

07:57.540 --> 08:00.540
I couldn't have picked
a better name myself.

08:00.540 --> 08:03.330
Everyone I bring here has been
saved from a tragic end

08:03.330 --> 08:05.580
and given
a new beginning.

08:05.580 --> 08:06.880
How do you do that?

08:06.880 --> 08:09.040
How did you see
my future?

08:09.040 --> 08:10.290
I'll show you.

08:11.540 --> 08:13.380
It's called
the Time Stream.

08:13.380 --> 08:15.210
Sent back
from the future.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.040
Almost done prepping,
Mr. Malick.

08:20.830 --> 08:22.580
As soon as Dr. Grady
here is finished,

08:22.580 --> 08:25.540
you'll get to
dip your toe in.

08:25.540 --> 08:29.380
Grady here's not afraid
of hazardous materials.

08:29.380 --> 08:32.460
S.H.I.E.L.D. decided
his tech was too dangerous

08:32.460 --> 08:35.420
and was set to take him out,
so I brought him into the fold.

08:37.170 --> 08:39.210
You saying
this thing's hazardous?

08:39.210 --> 08:41.620
Well, nothing to worry about.
It's not gonna hurt you.

08:41.620 --> 08:44.080
It'll just...
blow your mind.

08:46.620 --> 08:48.210
You'll be meeting Sibyl.

08:48.210 --> 08:50.250
She'll guide you.

08:50.250 --> 08:52.620
There's a lady in there?

08:53.960 --> 08:56.000
Something like that.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.790
She and I
are after something --

08:57.790 --> 08:59.330
same thing you were after

08:59.330 --> 09:01.830
in the story of your life
you're about to see.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.040
Immortality.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.170
Prepare yourself.

09:11.170 --> 09:13.580
Most people
don't like the ending.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.040
My people need protection.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.290
You should leave that
to us.

09:30.290 --> 09:32.210
I don't know
who you people are,

09:32.210 --> 09:34.040
and somehow,
you knew how to find me.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.500
We needed your help.

09:35.500 --> 09:38.670
And then you led that man
right to our front door.

09:38.670 --> 09:40.080
Daisy:
We're not your enemy.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.920
We save Inhumans.
He wants to take their gifts.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.710
That's how he got his.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.290
Is that even possible?

09:48.080 --> 09:49.960
It is.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.830
That could kill them.

09:51.830 --> 09:54.120
If I can get in,
I can get them out
without being seen.

09:56.500 --> 09:59.290
I got my power back --
thanks to you.

09:59.290 --> 10:01.620
And if you get taken,
you could lose it again,

10:01.620 --> 10:02.710
and then you give it to --
I'll go.

10:04.290 --> 10:06.290
Scout a point of attack.

10:06.290 --> 10:07.790
You said "be me."

10:07.790 --> 10:09.790
This me is disposable.
If I get caught --

10:09.790 --> 10:11.750
Disposable's
the last thing you are.

10:11.750 --> 10:13.830
Recyclable, then.
Minimal risk.

10:13.830 --> 10:14.960
I can take him in.

10:14.960 --> 10:15.920
I can't allow that.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.170
It's the easiest way.

10:17.170 --> 10:19.210
I know the layout.

10:19.210 --> 10:21.210
I'll drop him somewhere secret
and then go.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.250
Alright.

10:27.250 --> 10:29.080
We'll fly close
in the Quinjet.

10:29.080 --> 10:31.960
You and Gordon drop in, do
recon, and find the prisoners.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.000
Then Yo-Yo and I
will go in.

10:34.210 --> 10:35.670
I'm going with you.

10:35.670 --> 10:37.460
We need you alive.

10:37.460 --> 10:38.920
Your people
need you to lead.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.880
I have to get her back.

10:40.880 --> 10:42.500
Kora won't listen to you.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.500
Maybe I can
talk some sense into her.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.290
But if she sees you,
it can provoke her.

10:47.290 --> 10:48.920
A-And then
everyone's at risk.

10:50.710 --> 10:52.290
Gordon: They're right.

10:52.290 --> 10:54.080
We can't risk it.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.170
I'll stay.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.620
But you have to
bring back my daughter.

11:13.460 --> 11:15.000
What the hell, May?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.080
Did it just slip your mind
that I have a sister?

11:17.080 --> 11:19.540
We were trying not to be
swallowed by a time storm.

11:19.540 --> 11:21.380
Were you purposely trying
to keep me in the dark?

11:21.380 --> 11:23.210
Is this some weird way
of you trying to protect me?

11:23.210 --> 11:24.210
No.

11:25.880 --> 11:27.500
No.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.750
But Kora is volatile.

11:29.750 --> 11:31.540
She already tried
to kill your mother.

11:33.290 --> 11:35.790
She just never
said anything

11:35.790 --> 11:38.580
about a sister,
another kid.

11:40.170 --> 11:43.540
It's possible
that Kora wasn't alive.

11:45.580 --> 11:48.750
When we were at Afterlife,
she stole a gun from a guard,

11:48.750 --> 11:51.380
and I think she intended
to use it on herself.

11:51.380 --> 11:53.580
But Nathaniel
got to her.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.620
I think, in the original
timeline, she --

11:55.620 --> 11:56.710
She went through with it.

12:00.170 --> 12:03.080
Which is why my mom
would have left Afterlife

12:03.080 --> 12:04.790
to go do charity work
and meet my dad and --

12:04.790 --> 12:07.000
We can't go down that hole
right now, Daisy.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.790
Let me go with you.

12:08.790 --> 12:10.250
No.

12:10.250 --> 12:11.790
We need you and your mother
to survive.

12:11.790 --> 12:13.500
You're staying put.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.290
Don't tell me it's
because I'm not 100%,
because I feel fine.

12:15.290 --> 12:17.170
You're not going.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.790
This isn't time
for that family reunion.

12:20.460 --> 12:22.500
We promised your mom
we'd save Kora.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.790
If she can be saved.

12:29.790 --> 12:33.500
Nathaniel:
You can see the fluids
draining from Mr. Li here

12:33.500 --> 12:36.460
into our friend Mr. Durant.

12:38.290 --> 12:41.330
The process
used to be messy.

12:41.330 --> 12:43.210
But a guy I know
once said

12:43.210 --> 12:45.330
discovery requires
experimentation,

12:45.330 --> 12:48.420
so we experimented,
found a better way.

12:48.420 --> 12:50.380
Still not painless.

12:50.380 --> 12:54.290
This is Kora,
the one Inhuman we trust.

12:54.290 --> 12:56.000
The others felt entitled
to judge

12:56.000 --> 12:57.830
who is given gifts,
who not.

12:57.830 --> 12:59.420
It was tradition.

12:59.420 --> 13:01.920
When you're raised in it,
you don't know any better.

13:01.920 --> 13:03.710
Those days are over.

13:03.710 --> 13:05.710
Kora and I are
champions of the people,

13:05.710 --> 13:08.120
like Robin Hood -- stealing
from the high and mighty

13:08.120 --> 13:10.620
and giving
to those more deserving.

13:10.620 --> 13:13.540
Take Durant here.

13:13.540 --> 13:16.790
Simple mercenary, just trying
to earn a decent living.

13:16.790 --> 13:18.920
S.H.I.E.L.D. decided
he worked for the wrong people.

13:18.920 --> 13:21.040
What did they do, Durant?

13:21.040 --> 13:22.540
They shot down
our plane.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.540
They shot it
right out of the sky.

13:24.540 --> 13:27.880
And who are they
to decide that?

13:27.880 --> 13:30.170
S.H.I.E.L.D., Hydra,
Inhumans --

13:30.170 --> 13:33.170
all committing horrors
in the name of world order.

13:33.170 --> 13:34.120
Control.

13:35.750 --> 13:37.710
You saved him
from that oppression.

13:37.710 --> 13:39.330
And from
the crashing plane.

13:39.330 --> 13:40.960
What kind of power
is he getting?

13:50.880 --> 13:51.880
That's what
he's getting.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.830
Kora.

13:55.830 --> 13:58.040
Mr. Li is
in a lot of pain.

14:00.250 --> 14:02.080
Why don't you put him
out of his misery.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.170
Mercy comes
in many forms.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.080
I should have killed you
years ago.

14:16.880 --> 14:19.170
I forgive you
for believing that.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.960
I want a power like that.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.710
Nathaniel:
Don't worry.

14:39.710 --> 14:42.580
You'll get yours as soon
as we take it from S.H.I.E.L.D.

14:50.670 --> 14:52.040
20 minutes out.

14:56.330 --> 14:57.170
Nope.

14:57.170 --> 14:59.710
What?
You don't trust me?

14:59.710 --> 15:02.170
You seem pretty calm,
considering where we're headed.

15:02.170 --> 15:04.080
Well, this fight
is necessary.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.420
That probably helps.

15:26.540 --> 15:27.620
Hey.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.830
I was just...

15:30.830 --> 15:32.920
taking a look at this
again.

15:32.920 --> 15:36.250
Staying in the '80s wouldn't be
my worst-case scenario, but...

15:36.250 --> 15:38.750
I know everybody wants
to go home.

15:40.420 --> 15:43.620
And, hey, at least
we're still alive, right?

15:46.330 --> 15:48.880
It's not the first time
he's saved us.

15:48.880 --> 15:51.170
When it looked like the end
for Fitz and me,

15:51.170 --> 15:52.380
there was Enoch.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.790
Yeah, well,
he sacrificed himself

15:55.790 --> 15:58.210
so that we could
all go on.

15:58.210 --> 15:59.290
And we will.

16:02.250 --> 16:03.710
Just got to figure out why
this thing isn't communicating

16:03.710 --> 16:05.290
with Fitz anymore.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.000
Maybe it never was.

16:12.290 --> 16:13.960
But you said he was
controlling the jumps.

16:13.960 --> 16:16.250
I thought he was,
but consider the logic.

16:16.250 --> 16:17.710
We followed
wherever the Chronicoms went.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.830
They dictated
time and place.

16:19.830 --> 16:21.880
The Zephyr could have been
pre-programmed to follow.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.670
But we took out
the Chronicoms.

16:23.670 --> 16:26.500
And the Drive was damaged
in the process.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.790
Every jump since then
has been a malfunction.

16:31.420 --> 16:33.210
So, why wouldn't Fitz
help us?

16:40.670 --> 16:41.830
Don't.

16:43.080 --> 16:45.210
Maybe it's too painful
to remember.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.380
To want to remember.

16:48.380 --> 16:50.000
Please don't even
think that.

16:51.250 --> 16:52.670
I sent him messages

16:52.670 --> 16:54.830
that disappeared
into the depths of space.

16:56.750 --> 16:57.750
No answer.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.080
Fitz is out there.

17:00.330 --> 17:01.920
Whatever's
happening right now

17:01.920 --> 17:03.670
is happening
for a reason.

17:03.670 --> 17:05.920
We're gonna fix this
and get back to him.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.000
Okay?

17:09.290 --> 17:10.670
Yeah.

17:10.670 --> 17:12.670
Okay.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.040
Find the location of
the prisoners, then jump back.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.540
Copy.

17:32.540 --> 17:34.670
If you're not back in
30 minutes, we're coming in.

17:34.670 --> 17:37.420
And no hero business.
Understood?

17:37.420 --> 17:38.790
Understood.

17:38.790 --> 17:40.830
I'm taking us into a section
that's usually empty,

17:40.830 --> 17:42.040
so no one will see us.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.380
Is there anything special
you need me to do?

17:43.380 --> 17:45.580
Do we have to, like...
hug or something?

17:45.580 --> 17:48.040
You're hilarious, but no.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.460
You guys might want
to take a step back, though.

17:58.580 --> 18:00.500
I feel tingly.

18:00.500 --> 18:01.750
It goes away.

18:01.750 --> 18:04.960
Actually,
it's not unpleasant.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.920
If we head this way, we can find
where they're keeping them.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.750
Waiting is
the hardest part.

18:17.830 --> 18:19.750
Take him to be prepped.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.830
You knew we were coming.

18:27.830 --> 18:29.540
To this very spot.

18:29.540 --> 18:31.620
Well, if you want
to get technical,

18:31.620 --> 18:33.790
I knew
there was a 94% chance.

18:33.790 --> 18:35.460
Because you have
the Time Stream.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.540
You don't know what
you've gotten yourself into.

18:43.540 --> 18:46.250
Sibyl wants this planet
for her Chronicoms.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.670
Oh, you hear that,
Durant?

18:47.670 --> 18:49.460
I think he's giving us
the old good guy pitch,

18:49.460 --> 18:51.500
appealing to the "better
angels of my nature."

18:51.500 --> 18:54.120
Ooh.
Nice Abe Lincoln reference.

18:54.120 --> 18:56.290
Maybe I'm just
helping you not die.

18:56.290 --> 18:58.540
Your father was co-opted by
Sibyl. Look where that got him.

18:58.540 --> 19:00.250
Um, my father was killed
by your team.

19:00.250 --> 19:01.670
Or do you want to try
to deny that?

19:01.670 --> 19:03.540
Didn't get me as choked up
as I thought it would.

19:03.540 --> 19:05.540
Sounds like the apple
fell far from the tree.

19:05.540 --> 19:09.120
I have no use for
my father's way of thinking.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.880
He trapped himself
in Hydra,

19:10.880 --> 19:13.790
bound by its history,
rules, hierarchy.

19:13.790 --> 19:15.460
No, thanks.

19:15.460 --> 19:18.620
Here's my pitch --
goodbye to all that.

19:18.620 --> 19:21.790
Say hello to anarchy.

19:21.790 --> 19:24.670
You'd be surprised how tempting
that is to some people.

19:35.330 --> 19:36.620
Buddy!

19:36.620 --> 19:37.750
There he is!

19:42.080 --> 19:43.330
You don't
have to do this.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.080
He's just a kid.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.540
We gave him a chance
to join us.

19:48.540 --> 19:49.830
You must be Kora.

19:49.830 --> 19:51.670
And you're Agent Coulson.

19:51.670 --> 19:54.290
Oh, call him Phil.

19:54.290 --> 19:57.540
I've seen it all, bud --
everything you did to me.

19:57.540 --> 19:59.460
I'm sorry --
have we met?

19:59.460 --> 20:01.960
Not yet, but I got
a sneak peek at my future,

20:01.960 --> 20:03.880
and you play
a big part in it.

20:03.880 --> 20:05.460
Here's a hint --

20:05.460 --> 20:08.670
you vaporize me
with a space laser.

20:08.670 --> 20:10.210
Garrett.

20:10.210 --> 20:13.040
Clever -- digging up
our greatest hits.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.710
I'm not even mad.

20:14.710 --> 20:16.420
They let me watch you die
a bunch of times.

20:16.420 --> 20:17.750
Made me feel better.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.080
Oh, yeah?
Which one was your favorite?

20:19.080 --> 20:20.620
Uh -- Oh.

20:20.620 --> 20:23.330
Long-haired creepo,
stabbed you with a pointy stick.

20:23.330 --> 20:26.040
That was funny.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.420
You haven't changed
a bit.

20:27.420 --> 20:29.170
And I'm aware
that statement makes no sense.

20:32.040 --> 20:33.290
Here comes the good stuff,
John.

20:44.540 --> 20:45.920
Hmm.

20:58.580 --> 21:00.460
Hey.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.040
Hey.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.080
Lookin' spry
for an old guy.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.120
How's it feeling?

21:05.120 --> 21:06.420
Fantastic.

21:06.420 --> 21:08.330
I think I'm a fan
of the 21st century.

21:08.330 --> 21:09.420
Yeah, don't get
your hopes up.

21:09.420 --> 21:13.170
We make a mean prosthetic,
but, uh, fascism is back.

21:13.170 --> 21:15.080
You mean the thing I helped
wipe out 10 years ago?

21:15.080 --> 21:17.420
Yeah. The past
won't leave us alone.

21:17.420 --> 21:19.380
Yeah, Mack caught me up.

21:19.380 --> 21:23.210
You know, you said her name
to me when, uh...

21:23.210 --> 21:24.580
Malick was doing
a number on you.

21:24.580 --> 21:26.040
Jiaying.

21:27.830 --> 21:29.750
Hydra did
the same thing to her.

21:29.750 --> 21:31.710
They cut her up,
they took her power --

21:31.710 --> 21:34.170
in my past
and in her future.

21:35.960 --> 21:40.290
She can heal herself,
live...a long time.

21:40.290 --> 21:42.290
Malick thought
that's what I could do.

21:42.290 --> 21:44.460
He's after
the real thing now.

21:44.460 --> 21:47.120
Did Mack say anything about
what happened with her and I?

21:51.080 --> 21:54.710
Yeah, well, things got
really bad, and it...

21:57.210 --> 21:59.120
It's a long story.

21:59.120 --> 22:01.330
But it came to an end.

22:01.330 --> 22:03.000
Maybe now's your chance
to experience

22:03.000 --> 22:04.080
what she was like
before that.

22:05.580 --> 22:06.790
You should talk to her.

22:06.790 --> 22:07.920
No, I shouldn't.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.670
She -- She can't know
who I am.

22:09.670 --> 22:10.880
Why not?

22:10.880 --> 22:12.170
Because of
the timeline --

22:12.170 --> 22:13.620
The timeline is screwed.

22:13.620 --> 22:14.710
Pardon my French.

22:14.710 --> 22:15.920
And look who
you're talking to --

22:15.920 --> 22:17.330
a guy who served
under "I Like Ike"

22:17.330 --> 22:18.540
and was supposed to be dead
by now.

22:18.540 --> 22:19.460
Ike?

22:19.460 --> 22:20.670
Y--

22:20.670 --> 22:23.460
Point is...

22:23.460 --> 22:26.460
you got
a rare opportunity here.

22:26.460 --> 22:28.960
I got a list of people
long gone by now I'd...

22:28.960 --> 22:32.000
I'd do anything to have
one last stolen moment with.

22:33.210 --> 22:36.500
Regardless of what space-time
has to say about it.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.290
I don't know.

22:38.290 --> 22:39.880
I'll be your chaperone.
How about that?

22:39.880 --> 22:43.290
You need me to bail you out,
I'll be right there.

22:43.290 --> 22:46.540
You really are a square,
aren't you?

22:46.540 --> 22:48.830
Harsh, but...yes.

22:54.080 --> 22:56.620
Coulson, come in.

22:56.620 --> 22:57.960
Coulson!

22:57.960 --> 22:59.790
Something's wrong.
They should be back by now.

22:59.790 --> 23:00.830
My turn, then.

23:00.830 --> 23:02.500
I'll go in
and take a look around.

23:02.500 --> 23:03.670
No. It should be me.

23:03.670 --> 23:05.080
You stay put.

23:05.080 --> 23:06.710
I'll zip in and out.
They'll never see me coming.

23:06.710 --> 23:08.120
Unless they do.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.790
Mack.
If they caught Gordon,

23:09.790 --> 23:11.830
who knows
what we're walking into.

23:11.830 --> 23:13.460
Just stand by
for my signal.

23:13.460 --> 23:16.500
As soon as I find Coulson,
I'll call for you.

23:19.710 --> 23:21.670
I'll be ready.

23:24.330 --> 23:26.790
This isn't anarchy.
This is evil.

23:26.790 --> 23:29.330
Justice isn't always pretty,
Agent Coulson.

23:29.330 --> 23:31.380
You know, a man who's died
and killed as much as you

23:31.380 --> 23:33.120
should understand that
by now.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.290
Garrett:
Speaking of pretty,

23:34.290 --> 23:36.170
I get to keep
the old baby blues, right?

23:36.170 --> 23:37.420
Good question.

23:37.420 --> 23:39.380
You know,
I'm not...really sure.

23:39.380 --> 23:40.790
What?

23:40.790 --> 23:42.420
Whoa. No, no, no, no, no.
Time out, man!

23:42.420 --> 23:43.670
That is not
what I signed up for!

23:43.670 --> 23:45.040
Kora, please.

23:45.040 --> 23:47.380
Gordon helped Jiaying
keep Kora prisoner.

23:47.380 --> 23:49.960
Uh, dude, come on.

23:51.290 --> 23:52.960
I don't feel so hot.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.880
Uh, unplug me, man.

23:54.880 --> 23:56.290
I changed my mind!

23:59.420 --> 24:01.250
Garrett: Yoo-hoooo!

24:02.540 --> 24:04.170
You see?

24:04.170 --> 24:05.080
Everything worked out.
Huh?

24:05.080 --> 24:06.170
Pun intended.

24:06.170 --> 24:08.040
You don't know
what you're doing,

24:08.040 --> 24:09.830
giving that man
that power.

24:09.830 --> 24:11.790
It was written
in the stars.

24:13.080 --> 24:15.380
I wanted out,
and I was out.

24:15.380 --> 24:18.000
I disappeared,
reappeared.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.670
There should be
a word for that.

24:19.670 --> 24:21.460
You teleported.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.620
I like that!

24:22.620 --> 24:23.790
Yeah. Thanks, Phil.

24:23.790 --> 24:24.960
Alright, you think
with enough practice,

24:24.960 --> 24:26.000
you could
take me with you,

24:26.000 --> 24:27.540
you could go
where I tell you to?

24:27.540 --> 24:28.460
Bet your bottom dollar.

24:28.460 --> 24:30.040
Good.

24:30.040 --> 24:31.670
We have our target out there.
Let's go find her.

24:33.210 --> 24:34.500
Hang on.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.670
Is that...

24:35.670 --> 24:37.330
Oh, yep!

24:37.330 --> 24:38.790
Here it comes.

24:38.790 --> 24:41.250
Cleared for takeoff, bud.

24:52.250 --> 24:53.960
Tell me there's news.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.330
I'm sorry.
Nothing yet.

24:56.330 --> 24:57.880
I knew
this was a mistake.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.250
I never should've agreed
to this plan.

24:59.250 --> 25:00.710
You can trust us.

25:00.710 --> 25:02.210
Trust you?

25:02.210 --> 25:03.880
I don't know
anything about you.

25:03.880 --> 25:05.290
And no one will
tell me anything.

25:05.290 --> 25:06.620
We just want to help.

25:08.120 --> 25:10.580
Afterlife is important
to us, too.

25:10.580 --> 25:12.620
You don't know
the first thing about it.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.120
She's been there.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.120
Before your friends
showed up,

25:20.120 --> 25:22.420
we'd never had
an outsider find us.

25:22.420 --> 25:24.380
She's no outsider.

25:27.330 --> 25:29.210
Go on. Show her.

25:49.920 --> 25:51.170
Vibrations.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.960
Where did you learn that?

25:55.960 --> 25:57.000
From you.

25:58.540 --> 26:00.210
At Afterlife.

26:00.210 --> 26:02.080
In 30 years.

26:05.710 --> 26:07.580
We're from the future,
and I know how that sounds,

26:07.580 --> 26:08.670
but it's...

26:10.920 --> 26:12.380
...it's the truth.

26:13.790 --> 26:14.960
I, um...

26:16.670 --> 26:19.120
I had a feeling I...

26:19.120 --> 26:21.670
I knew you.

26:21.670 --> 26:24.880
There's something...

26:24.880 --> 26:26.080
so familiar.

26:29.790 --> 26:32.000
Your gift --
it's a lot like...

26:38.750 --> 26:41.620
Nathaniel took that
from you.

26:41.620 --> 26:43.420
It almost killed me.

26:45.620 --> 26:49.170
It's knowledge of the future
that led him to us,

26:49.170 --> 26:52.120
that he used
to warp Kora's mind

26:52.120 --> 26:54.170
and turn her against me.

27:00.040 --> 27:01.080
Were you close
with her?

27:05.710 --> 27:07.670
Inseparable.

27:07.670 --> 27:10.460
She clung to my leg
for the first three years.

27:10.460 --> 27:12.540
Shy, sweet girl.

27:12.540 --> 27:14.210
What changed?

27:16.290 --> 27:18.620
Terrigenesis.

27:18.620 --> 27:21.170
I thought she was ready,
but...

27:21.170 --> 27:22.540
Kora lost control.

27:22.540 --> 27:24.460
There were accidents.

27:24.460 --> 27:27.540
The more I tried to help,
the more she pulled away.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.250
That must be hard.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.960
Being so close to someone

27:35.960 --> 27:39.540
and not being able
to reach them.

27:41.460 --> 27:43.880
The others...

27:43.880 --> 27:47.040
they wanted her gone.

27:47.040 --> 27:50.920
But they don't see
what I do.

27:50.920 --> 27:53.750
Kora has a --
a good heart.

27:53.750 --> 27:56.670
She's worth saving.

27:56.670 --> 27:58.460
Well, she's lucky
to have you.

28:02.250 --> 28:05.620
My power has allowed me
to live a long life.

28:05.620 --> 28:08.080
I used to think
it was my greatest gift,

28:08.080 --> 28:10.080
but I was wrong.

28:12.120 --> 28:13.580
It was her.

28:18.670 --> 28:20.170
Um...sorry.

28:20.170 --> 28:21.960
Did I say something?

28:21.960 --> 28:23.420
Uh...

28:25.580 --> 28:27.670
Growing up, I...

28:27.670 --> 28:30.250
I never knew my mom.

28:30.250 --> 28:35.040
And when I finally
found her...

28:35.040 --> 28:36.670
uh...

28:36.670 --> 28:38.790
she wasn't who I'd hoped
she would be.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.040
She hurt you.

28:45.920 --> 28:50.120
I can't speak
to your mother's reasons,

28:50.120 --> 28:53.500
but for me...

28:53.500 --> 28:58.000
sometimes, trying to do
the right thing

28:58.000 --> 29:00.960
comes out all wrong.

29:13.830 --> 29:14.830
We're here.

29:14.830 --> 29:17.290
Nailed it!
Yoo!

29:17.290 --> 29:19.080
More like
third time's a charm.

29:20.540 --> 29:24.120
Hey. I saw these guys
open up for Twisted Sister.

29:26.170 --> 29:30.170
You've had yourself a day,
but it's not over yet.

29:30.170 --> 29:32.250
We're gonna have to split up.
Are you ready?

29:32.250 --> 29:35.330
If the job was easy,
it wouldn't be any fun.

29:44.290 --> 29:45.670
Coulson.

29:45.670 --> 29:47.620
Hang in there.
We're leaving.

29:47.620 --> 29:49.210
The door.

29:49.210 --> 29:51.620
You let me
worry about that.

29:51.620 --> 29:54.250
This room was built
to hold powerful Inhumans.

29:54.250 --> 29:55.420
Yeah?

29:55.420 --> 29:57.120
And I'm about to
bust us out of here.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.210
Watch.

29:58.210 --> 30:00.460
It's gonna be
super-satisfying.

30:00.460 --> 30:01.580
You can't get us out.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.380
But maybe I can.

30:06.420 --> 30:08.080
Save your energy.
You're too weak.

30:09.170 --> 30:11.250
The other Inhumans...

30:11.250 --> 30:12.960
I can't let this
happen to them.

30:12.960 --> 30:14.000
Gordon, wait!

30:17.330 --> 30:19.250
It's okay.
You're gonna be alright.

30:21.040 --> 30:22.830
You're hilarious.

30:31.920 --> 30:33.620
Who the hell are you?

30:35.120 --> 30:36.880
Melinda May!

30:36.880 --> 30:39.250
Blast from the future!

30:39.250 --> 30:41.420
It's your old buddy --
John Garrett.

30:41.420 --> 30:43.040
Same rugged good looks --

30:43.040 --> 30:45.080
just...maybe
a little less rugged.

30:46.580 --> 30:48.460
How'd you find this place,
John?

30:48.460 --> 30:51.250
Well, my pal Nate
told me how to find it.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.210
He's around here
somewhere.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.120
I know where I'm going,

31:02.120 --> 31:03.750
but the landing part's
a little tricky.

31:05.120 --> 31:07.500
Coulson called it
teleporting.

31:07.500 --> 31:08.380
Gordon.

31:10.210 --> 31:11.880
What are you doing here?

31:11.880 --> 31:13.380
Planning
a little road trip.

31:13.380 --> 31:15.290
Looking for an open-minded gal
to tag along.

31:15.290 --> 31:16.880
Thought you'd never ask.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.040
Oh, sorry, babe.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.330
You ain't who I'm --

31:29.420 --> 31:30.540
Oh, right.

31:30.540 --> 31:31.580
Bye.

31:37.790 --> 31:38.880
Whoa.

31:43.960 --> 31:46.000
Daisy, do you copy?

31:46.000 --> 31:47.080
Daisy, come in.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.290
May, what's wrong?

31:48.290 --> 31:49.920
John Garrett's here
with Nathaniel,

31:49.920 --> 31:51.040
and they have
Gordon's powers.

31:51.040 --> 31:53.670
Get Jiaying someplace safe.

31:53.670 --> 31:55.420
We have to go.

32:01.790 --> 32:03.710
I've been looking
all over for you.

32:11.620 --> 32:13.750
Mack: Coulson.

32:13.750 --> 32:15.000
Gordon?

32:16.210 --> 32:18.290
The Inhumans are being held
in a room down that way.

32:21.210 --> 32:22.210
Alright.

32:23.250 --> 32:24.250
Better call Yo-Yo.

32:24.250 --> 32:25.830
Yo -- Yo --

32:25.830 --> 32:27.210
Still not used to that.

32:27.210 --> 32:29.460
May radio'd.
Nathaniel's at the Lighthouse.

32:29.460 --> 32:30.790
He's with John Garrett.

32:30.790 --> 32:32.080
I'll explain
on the way back.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.460
Okay.

32:33.460 --> 32:34.920
Yo-Yo and I
will get the hostages out.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.540
Find Kora. We'll meet
back at the Quinjet.

32:36.540 --> 32:38.380
I got a feeling
she might be expecting that.

32:40.750 --> 32:42.830
Malick's got guards
up ahead.

32:42.830 --> 32:44.080
No problem.

32:45.710 --> 32:46.790
Hey, dummy!

32:51.830 --> 32:53.120
Do your thing.

32:55.790 --> 32:57.420
Aah!

33:04.080 --> 33:06.420
It's okay.
You're safe.

33:09.380 --> 33:11.750
For the record,
I'm digging the upgrade.

33:12.960 --> 33:15.120
Alright.
Let's get you out of here.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.620
Don't shoot.

33:20.880 --> 33:22.460
The two of us in here?

33:22.460 --> 33:24.580
You want to bring the whole of
River's End down on our heads?

33:24.580 --> 33:25.460
Give me a reason.

33:27.250 --> 33:29.290
Where's Kora?
What have you done with her?

33:31.330 --> 33:33.000
Sorry.
Kora couldn't make it.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.420
But she sends her best.

33:34.420 --> 33:36.210
And don't you look at me
like that.

33:36.210 --> 33:37.880
You still have Daisy.

33:37.880 --> 33:39.080
Isn't one daughter enough?

33:44.620 --> 33:46.460
Oh.
Y-You didn't know.

33:49.960 --> 33:53.620
Wow. It's like a season finale
of "Dallas" around here.

33:53.620 --> 33:55.750
I'm sorry.

33:55.750 --> 33:57.080
I wanted to tell you,
but I --

33:57.080 --> 33:59.040
What you said
about your mother --

33:59.040 --> 34:00.670
you were talking
about me.

34:00.670 --> 34:02.620
It's...

34:02.620 --> 34:03.790
It's okay.

34:03.790 --> 34:05.380
I hurt you?

34:05.380 --> 34:06.580
But I would never --

34:06.580 --> 34:08.790
It's actually
a riveting story.

34:08.790 --> 34:11.000
See, Hydra just cuts you
all to bits.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.580
You're left for dead,
your powers stolen.

34:12.580 --> 34:16.170
That part, you both
have in common now.

34:16.170 --> 34:17.960
Daisy grows up alone.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.960
Sad.

34:19.960 --> 34:21.330
Finds you eventually,
but by then,

34:21.330 --> 34:23.250
you're all militant
and she's with S.H.I.E.L.D. --

34:23.250 --> 34:25.080
Stop it.
You're on opposite sides.

34:25.080 --> 34:27.040
So you start to drain
the life out of her.

34:27.040 --> 34:28.620
Enough.
And it's working.

34:28.620 --> 34:29.960
You're about to kill her.

34:29.960 --> 34:33.080
But guess who steps in
to crush your spine.

34:33.080 --> 34:34.210
Dear old --

34:34.210 --> 34:35.670
Enough!

34:42.880 --> 34:44.620
Nice quake.

34:44.620 --> 34:46.080
I'd give it a B.

34:46.080 --> 34:47.620
B-plus.

34:47.620 --> 34:49.710
Definitely room
for improvement.

34:59.120 --> 35:00.620
If you haven't done
the math,

35:00.620 --> 35:03.170
I've had these powers
a lot longer than you have.

35:05.420 --> 35:08.080
Leave my daughter
alone.

35:17.290 --> 35:18.670
Stay back.

35:18.670 --> 35:19.670
I won't say it again.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.120
Mom, no!

35:29.830 --> 35:31.170
Well, I guess
she won't live forever.

35:33.710 --> 35:35.210
And you won't live at all.

36:30.580 --> 36:32.750
If he's not here for Jiaying,
what's he after?

36:34.330 --> 36:36.710
Who's this Garrett fella,
anyway?

36:43.540 --> 36:44.710
There you are!

36:44.710 --> 36:45.920
Sousa, shoot him!

37:16.330 --> 37:17.580
Kora.

37:19.380 --> 37:20.460
Turn around.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.210
Slowly.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.920
Agent Coulson.

37:28.920 --> 37:30.500
I've been waiting.

37:31.710 --> 37:34.000
The rest of your gang
is gone.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.420
They abandoned you.

37:35.420 --> 37:38.750
Garrett moved them off
somewhere else.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.170
I wanted
to come with you.

37:41.750 --> 37:43.500
Meet my sister.

37:43.500 --> 37:45.120
You know, Sibyl told me
all about her --

37:52.620 --> 37:54.830
May:
Nathaniel killed Jiaying.

37:54.830 --> 37:57.500
I don't understand, but he
didn't want her power at all.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.120
I'm still trying
to find where he went,

37:59.120 --> 38:00.920
and Garrett's MIA, too.

38:42.420 --> 38:43.670
They took Simmons.

38:52.420 --> 38:53.250
Where's Deke?

39:00.120 --> 39:01.620
May: Deke, come in.

39:01.620 --> 39:02.620
Deke.

39:04.330 --> 39:07.040
Deke, come in.
Where are you?

39:20.580 --> 39:22.960
Deke Shaw,
answer your radio!

39:24.580 --> 39:26.000
May,
where are we going?

39:26.000 --> 39:27.790
We're not going anywhere.
You are.

39:27.790 --> 39:29.380
The Zephyr's been hijacked.

39:55.500 --> 39:56.920
We'll return in a moment.

40:00.790 --> 40:04.290
Garrett: Today just keeps
getting better and better.

40:04.290 --> 40:08.420
First, superpowers,
now a spaceship.

40:08.420 --> 40:11.420
Can I get
a "best day ever"?!

40:11.420 --> 40:12.960
Best day ever!

40:12.960 --> 40:15.580
If duct tape doesn't work,
I can liquify a femur or two.

40:15.580 --> 40:16.830
It's your call.

40:21.330 --> 40:23.620
Why am I here?
What do you want?

40:23.620 --> 40:27.250
My pal Sibyl
ran the numbers,

40:27.250 --> 40:29.170
and every outcome
where we don't come out on top

40:29.170 --> 40:30.830
has one thing in common.

40:31.790 --> 40:33.250
Fitz.

40:33.250 --> 40:36.080
He's gotten in our way
long enough.

40:36.080 --> 40:38.120
And now you're gonna
take us to him.
