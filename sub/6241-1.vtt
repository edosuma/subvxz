01:05.832 --> 01:07.409
Merry Christmas Eve, bitch.

01:11.104 --> 01:12.082
Hi.

01:18.344 --> 01:19.721
Are we supposed to share it?

01:19.913 --> 01:21.722
Yes, we're supposed to share it,
bitch. I am broke.

01:22.715 --> 01:24.388
- How've you been?
- I've been great.

01:24.584 --> 01:26.188
You finally got tits, bitch!

01:26.886 --> 01:28.194
Bitch, the estrogen has been kicking in,

01:28.388 --> 01:30.561
the only thing it hasn't broken down
was these fucking arms.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.065
Everything else on my body looks good.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.236
- Oh, honey.
- Don't you try it.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.496
I look like the real thing.

01:34.694 --> 01:36.401
So, I got some good news to tell you.

01:36.629 --> 01:38.506
- What?
- I've been keeping a secret

01:38.698 --> 01:40.405
about me and Chester.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.240
Girl... Whoo! I know what it is!

01:43.436 --> 01:44.881
You're breaking up with him!

01:45.071 --> 01:46.846
Thank God.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.350
Because honey, if he's gonna be
cheating on you like that...

01:49.542 --> 01:51.021
Wait, wait, wait. What?

01:56.716 --> 01:58.024
You didn't know?

02:04.424 --> 02:05.528
How the fuck would I know?

02:05.725 --> 02:07.864
Girl, because everything that
you've been hearing on the block

02:08.061 --> 02:09.937
about the girl that he's been with.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.041
Girl, you are the first girl
I've seen on the block.

02:15.935 --> 02:16.913
Who is she?

02:17.103 --> 02:18.878
Girl, she's some white fish.
I don't know.

02:19.072 --> 02:20.881
Chester is fucking cheating on me
with real fish?

02:21.074 --> 02:23.884
Yeah, bitch. Like a real fish girl,
like vagina and everything.

02:24.444 --> 02:28.256
I've been gone for 28 fucking days!

02:28.448 --> 02:31.255
And you mean to tell me that he's been
out here cheating on me with fish?

02:33.019 --> 02:33.997
Yeah.

02:34.921 --> 02:35.991
Do I know her?

02:37.423 --> 02:38.959
I don't know. I just know
that her name starts with a D.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.160
It's something like...

02:41.461 --> 02:42.599
Danielle...

02:43.296 --> 02:44.468
Desiree...

02:45.031 --> 02:48.137
- Dee Dee... I don't know, girl!
- Give me your fucking phone!

02:48.334 --> 02:50.940
It was shut off.
I had to cover your rent last month.

02:59.445 --> 03:01.152
I've been told you
this was gonna happen.

03:03.049 --> 03:04.426
All men cheat.

03:05.451 --> 03:06.862
That's why they're called trade.

03:07.053 --> 03:09.329
Do them just as dirty as they do us.

03:10.390 --> 03:12.836
Out here it's all about our hustle,

03:13.226 --> 03:15.001
and that's it.

03:18.231 --> 03:19.437
What are you plotting?

03:33.713 --> 03:35.659
Merry Fucking Christmas.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.867
Hey, girl, you back from vacation?

03:47.060 --> 03:49.199
Bitch, it's a motherfucking disco
out here, bitch.

03:49.395 --> 03:50.339
Why?

03:50.530 --> 03:51.531
Where the fuck is Chester at?

03:53.566 --> 03:56.240
I don't know who the fuck this bitch is,
but it's a white bitch.

03:56.502 --> 03:57.845
It's a white real fish.

03:58.204 --> 04:01.344
Girl, don't he have a lot of girls
that he been messing with, girl?

04:03.243 --> 04:05.245
Something with a D!
Something with a D! Desiree...

04:05.445 --> 04:06.753
- Dominique...
- Destiny?

04:07.347 --> 04:09.884
Bitch, I don't know what the fuck
her name is, bitch!

04:13.519 --> 04:14.691
Why do fish come in to our territory?

04:14.887 --> 04:16.524
Cause when they're Jane, girl,
they're jade.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.661
Want to smoke some weed?
I got some weed.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.270
Bitch, you know I don't do downers,
bitch. You know I'm an upper ho.

04:25.865 --> 04:28.243
- Sin-Dee.
- Oh, hey, Alexandra.

04:28.434 --> 04:29.879
Girl, give me a hug.

04:30.703 --> 04:32.046
See you later, God bless.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.013
OK, I got you.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.679
Girl, calm the fuck down,
it's not that serious.

04:36.909 --> 04:38.513
Not that serious my fucking ass, girl.

04:38.711 --> 04:40.588
I already told you, it's just a rumor.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.418
You don't know just yet if it's true.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.894
Bitch, I've been hearing shit in jail,
I've been hearing shit out here.

04:45.084 --> 04:46.461
I don't know the fuck is real anymore.

05:00.800 --> 05:01.801
Sin-Dee!

05:02.869 --> 05:04.746
Calm your ass down now
or I am going home!

05:04.971 --> 05:08.043
- Oh, girl, shut your ass up!
- That's it! I am going home!

05:08.908 --> 05:11.445
White Boy! Where the fuck is Chester?

05:11.978 --> 05:13.116
I don't know.
I haven't seen him all day.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.587
What the fuck you mean
you haven't seen him?

05:16.582 --> 05:18.823
- Oh, hey, what's the T bitch?
- Girl, what's your T?

05:19.018 --> 05:20.258
Have you seen that white bitch either?

05:20.453 --> 05:22.091
I haven't seen anybody,
leave me the fuck alone.

05:22.288 --> 05:23.892
- Take these flyers.
- OK, OK...

05:24.123 --> 05:25.830
Please be there tonight.
Don't disappoint me.

05:26.025 --> 05:27.060
I will. I will be there.

05:27.260 --> 05:28.830
You want me to walk all the way
to Vermont?

05:29.028 --> 05:30.769
- Mary's at 7:00.
- OK.

05:30.963 --> 05:34.800
- Mary's at 7:00. Mary's at 7:00.
- OK.

05:35.501 --> 05:36.844
I will be there, I promise.

05:37.036 --> 05:38.515
Now, I've got to deal
with this bitch over here.

05:38.705 --> 05:39.809
She's getting on my fucking nerves.

05:40.039 --> 05:41.313
- You got any T on you?
- No, I don't.

05:41.541 --> 05:42.576
Are you sure?

05:43.109 --> 05:45.487
Yes, I am sure!
You're making me lose my game.

05:45.812 --> 05:48.485
This is what the fuck I'm dealing with.
I cannot take it no more.

05:48.781 --> 05:50.658
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:51.784 --> 05:53.855
Girl, wait, wait, wait.
I cannot do this.

05:54.053 --> 05:55.293
I cannot do this, it's too much drama.

05:55.488 --> 05:56.990
You just come out here and give me
all this information.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.101
To have me go handle it by myself.
You're the one who told me anyways.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.795
OK, OK, OK! I will go with you
under one condition.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.338
You must promise to me that
there's not gonna be any drama.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.635
Because as soon as there's
some drama, I'm out of there!

06:06.833 --> 06:08.642
I promise. I promise.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.844
Look at me in my eyes and promise!

06:11.037 --> 06:14.018
I promise no drama, Alexandra!

06:14.807 --> 06:15.785
Come on!

06:19.679 --> 06:21.124
What the fuck you two looking at?

06:39.031 --> 06:40.374
Bitch, like I am clockable!

06:40.566 --> 06:42.239
You can't get it on me, bitch,
you can't get it on me, bitch.

06:42.435 --> 06:43.470
I am fierce as fuck.

06:43.669 --> 06:45.205
I don't know what the fuck
she was tripping on, girl.

06:45.438 --> 06:46.416
True.

06:59.385 --> 07:00.591
1351 Orange?

07:01.053 --> 07:02.555
- Yes, please.
- Alright.

07:04.891 --> 07:06.700
Is that a dog or a cat?

07:07.460 --> 07:08.939
A dog.

07:12.064 --> 07:13.134
What's the name?

07:14.434 --> 07:15.412
Alfie.

07:17.069 --> 07:18.844
Alfie is a very well behaved dog, huh?

07:19.038 --> 07:20.540
It's so quiet.

07:23.810 --> 07:24.948
It's empty.

07:29.482 --> 07:32.429
And his breath always smells like
he's been eating ass for days!

07:32.652 --> 07:35.861
I mean when I walk into the room, it
shouldn't always smell like homeless.

07:36.055 --> 07:39.229
And those socks, why are those socks
so fucking black!

07:39.459 --> 07:41.939
That's not a pimp.
What do you see in him?

07:42.128 --> 07:43.607
Why are you looking for him?

07:44.063 --> 07:45.508
Girl, you right! You right!

07:45.698 --> 07:46.836
It ain't his ass I should be
worried about.

07:47.033 --> 07:49.137
It should be that bitch. She's the one
trying to come on my man.

07:49.238 --> 07:51.207
Bitch, you're smart!
I'm gonna fuck her up!

07:51.504 --> 07:54.110
- That's not what I meant!
- That's exactly what you meant!

07:54.307 --> 07:55.445
Because that bitch wants to try with me.

07:55.641 --> 07:56.779
- I didn't mean that!
- I can give pussy,

07:56.976 --> 07:57.954
it's called a fucking tuck.

08:30.042 --> 08:31.749
Oh, my God! Look, there's Sin-Dee!

08:32.044 --> 08:34.615
I haven't seen her for so long, girl.
She's looking good!

08:35.047 --> 08:37.857
Oh, girl! What's up? What's the T?

08:38.650 --> 08:41.131
Sin-Dee! Oh, my God.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.765
So how was it, bitch?

08:42.955 --> 08:43.956
Tell me the T!

08:44.155 --> 08:45.829
Did you get a lot of trade
up in there or what?

08:46.025 --> 08:48.027
I want you guys to come
to my show tonight.

08:48.227 --> 08:49.831
I am so excited about that!

08:50.463 --> 08:52.443
T was the night before Alexandra.

08:52.832 --> 08:53.833
Stunning goddess...

08:54.534 --> 08:55.842
7:00pm sharp!

08:56.035 --> 08:57.514
Has any of you motherfuckers
seen Chester?

08:57.904 --> 08:59.713
- No, not me.
- Here we go again.

08:59.906 --> 09:01.886
Girl, she saw hisself
trying to cheat on me.

09:02.408 --> 09:03.853
While I'm up in there, girl! Me, bitch!

09:04.043 --> 09:06.614
- I wish I never told her.
- I heard about that fish.

09:06.812 --> 09:07.847
And who the fuck is she?

09:08.047 --> 09:10.049
Desiree! Sounds like Desiree.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.787
Girl, do you really want
to go back to prison?

09:12.985 --> 09:14.396
You just got out, mama.

09:14.820 --> 09:15.821
I told her that too.

09:16.022 --> 09:17.467
He act like prison is a bad place to go.

09:17.690 --> 09:20.330
Mama, mama, you are so much better
than she is.

09:20.526 --> 09:23.507
Look. My boyfriend, my husband.

09:23.763 --> 09:25.709
OK, that's fine. But he's not with you.
He's with her.

09:25.932 --> 09:28.412
He left you for her
the minute you went to jail.

09:28.601 --> 09:29.909
- Girl, I am so mad.
- Why don't you just stop?

09:30.102 --> 09:31.979
- I don't know what else to say.
- The only thing I can say is this.

09:32.171 --> 09:33.149
Get that motherfucker!

09:35.441 --> 09:36.476
Oh, girl.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.313
Another black boy on a board.

09:38.544 --> 09:40.023
They all think
they are goddamn Lil Wayne.

09:41.180 --> 09:44.859
I remember one Christmas,
I was like six or seven,

09:45.217 --> 09:48.357
my family bought me
the cutest little Barney doll,

09:48.788 --> 09:51.029
that I would take with me everywhere.

09:51.691 --> 09:55.605
And one day I put it inside
the tub with me,

09:55.861 --> 09:57.772
- to give it a bath.
- Oh, girl, she tried her out.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.668
And it just stopped working.

09:59.865 --> 10:01.867
It stopped singing
the "I love you" song.

10:02.068 --> 10:03.877
And I was just so upset.

10:04.070 --> 10:05.879
The world can be a cruel place.

10:06.072 --> 10:08.245
Yeah, it is cruel. God gave me a penis.

10:09.041 --> 10:10.520
That's pretty damn cruel,
don't you think?

10:12.044 --> 10:15.289
You speak English pretty good.
Where are you from?

10:16.048 --> 10:17.026
I'm Armenian.

10:19.218 --> 10:22.859
Yeah, I knew some people,
came from Armenia.

10:23.055 --> 10:25.865
Brought a lot of jewelry with them,
when they got out.

10:26.058 --> 10:28.436
They lived on that jewelry,
had a restaurant.

10:29.061 --> 10:30.369
What part of Armenia?

10:31.163 --> 10:32.198
From the capital.

10:33.065 --> 10:34.043
From Yerevan.

10:35.501 --> 10:36.479
Shit.

10:36.936 --> 10:40.110
I'm from Oklahoma,
and I am a Cherokee Indian.

10:40.406 --> 10:43.580
I got... I got a girl's name, Mia.

10:44.076 --> 10:47.785
But, it's a feminine name in English,
but it's not in Cherokee.

10:47.980 --> 10:51.985
I was named like all
Indian Cherokee babies are named.

10:52.918 --> 10:54.989
First thing the mother sees
when the baby is born

10:55.187 --> 10:56.825
she names that fucking baby.

10:57.023 --> 10:59.060
So when I was born,
my mama looked out the window,

10:59.258 --> 11:03.229
and she seen a red bird,
flying overhead in the sky.

11:04.096 --> 11:07.009
Cherokee Indian name
for red bird is Mia Mia.

11:07.700 --> 11:10.378
So, she called me Mia.

11:11.637 --> 11:13.913
If you think that's a girl's name,
it's not.

11:15.041 --> 11:18.022
I'm glad she didn't look out
the window and see an outhouse.

11:19.779 --> 11:23.186
Can you imagine? Look, hey,
here comes "Big Shit Thompson!"

11:23.449 --> 11:25.861
Right down the goddamn street.
Here he comes.

11:26.052 --> 11:27.588
Oh, fuck.

11:28.054 --> 11:30.034
- You OK?
- I don't know.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.161
You got any aspirin?

11:32.525 --> 11:34.505
- No.
- Oh, fuck.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.533
- Is this Sunset Boulevard?
- Yeah.

11:41.901 --> 11:43.437
You said you are going downtown, right?

11:44.637 --> 11:45.615
Yeah.

11:49.975 --> 11:51.010
I'm in no hurry.

11:58.584 --> 12:00.222
I'm gonna take 101, OK?

12:01.721 --> 12:02.859
I don't give a shit.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.831
You do what you want to do.
You're the driver.

12:28.047 --> 12:30.027
Remember, Sin-Dee. No drama!

12:30.416 --> 12:31.394
Yeah, no drama.

12:35.054 --> 12:36.032
Hello.

12:36.222 --> 12:39.499
Hey, Mila, did you see Nash?
That little negro.

12:39.692 --> 12:40.693
In the back.

12:48.234 --> 12:50.544
Girl. Nash!

12:50.870 --> 12:53.350
Hi, Nash! Girl, girl, it's Nash, girl!

12:53.806 --> 12:55.376
What's up, Sin-Dee. How are you doing?

12:55.608 --> 12:57.281
- I haven't seen you forever.
- Yeah.

12:57.476 --> 12:58.511
It's been a long time.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.452
It's cool. I'm glad you're out
and everything.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.556
Look at this,
business is booming today. Yes!

13:03.816 --> 13:04.851
How can I help you?

13:05.050 --> 13:06.393
I just haven't seen you in a long time.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.030
You are... Chester.

13:08.220 --> 13:09.460
I haven't seen Chester
in a long time, either.

13:09.655 --> 13:10.725
Me, neither.

13:10.923 --> 13:12.300
He's been hanging out
with my new friend.

13:12.491 --> 13:14.630
Her name is Dani.

13:15.060 --> 13:18.530
Something Dominique... Desiree...

13:19.064 --> 13:20.737
No, I ain't seen her, sorry.

13:20.933 --> 13:24.039
Well. Listen, Sin-Dee.
It's good seeing you, but...

13:24.403 --> 13:25.882
No, no, no, no.

13:26.071 --> 13:28.278
You know where the fuck she is.
So stop lying to me Nash.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.612
And tell me where the fuck she is...

13:29.809 --> 13:32.483
Sin-Dee, just calm down.
I ain't seen nobody.

13:32.778 --> 13:34.257
This is a place for business,
I am trying to...

13:34.446 --> 13:35.823
You know who the fuck
I am talking about?

13:36.015 --> 13:37.323
Tell me where the fuck she is.

13:37.516 --> 13:39.655
- Listen! First of all...
- OK.

13:39.919 --> 13:40.920
Get some Tic-Tacs.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.327
Number two, I don't know who the fuck
you are talking about.

13:43.522 --> 13:44.660
This is my place of business.

13:44.857 --> 13:46.302
And you are fucking my shit up
right now.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.301
Oh, shut the fuck up
you lackey ass bitch!

13:48.494 --> 13:49.939
- Where the fuck is she?
- I ain't telling you shit.

13:50.129 --> 13:51.301
And you need to get
the fuck out of here!

13:51.497 --> 13:53.841
Look, I'm not doing this!
I'm out of here. Cause you know...

13:54.033 --> 13:55.842
I told you, I already told you!

13:56.035 --> 13:57.013
Bye!

13:57.203 --> 13:58.841
Girl! Alexandra, girl! Hold on!

13:59.038 --> 14:00.676
Just one more minute...

14:05.044 --> 14:06.819
Would you just go with your homeboy
and get the fuck out of here?

14:07.012 --> 14:08.184
Oh, now you want to talk shit?

14:14.320 --> 14:15.765
I'm not going nowhere!

14:15.955 --> 14:17.434
- I don't know who...
- Where are they?

14:22.494 --> 14:23.768
I don't support that pimping shit.

14:23.963 --> 14:24.964
I stay on my side of the business.

14:25.164 --> 14:27.201
I am morally opposed
to the pimping shit.

14:27.466 --> 14:29.639
So, listen. Don't ask me shit like that.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.993
- Alright, listen, listen.
- Hello?

14:44.183 --> 14:46.163
Half of the city is down at Schrader.

14:46.352 --> 14:47.956
There is a food line
and they are giving away

14:48.153 --> 14:50.861
$20 Christmas gift certificate.
Some shit like that, alright?

14:51.056 --> 14:52.364
- Schrader!
- Food line!

14:53.058 --> 14:54.162
Thank you!

14:55.728 --> 14:56.866
Alright, come on, man!

14:57.062 --> 14:58.040
For real?

14:59.064 --> 15:00.065
Looks like you need a new pack.

15:22.888 --> 15:25.494
Anybody have a lighter?
Anybody have a lighter?

15:25.724 --> 15:27.362
Anybody have a fucking light?

15:29.061 --> 15:30.734
Do you have a light? Excuse me. Hey!

15:30.930 --> 15:32.534
Excuse me, hello! Do you have a light?

15:33.933 --> 15:34.934
Thank you.

17:07.326 --> 17:08.327
Fuck it!

17:35.654 --> 17:38.863
There are girls at the Christmas party.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.039
On Olympic... So fucking,
just fucking go there.

17:43.662 --> 17:47.405
Just go to... Take us to Olympic.
Mexican, he is a Mexican.

17:48.100 --> 17:51.079
You know where Olympic, that's south
of just fucking all the other streets.

17:51.336 --> 17:52.474
You know that, right?

17:52.738 --> 17:53.716
Yeah.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.215
Just get us there.
Just get us there quick

17:56.408 --> 17:58.410
before the other guys show up there.

17:59.778 --> 18:02.619
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, man!

18:04.550 --> 18:07.360
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
Get out of my car, come on.

18:09.054 --> 18:11.000
Come out. Get the fuck out.

18:11.190 --> 18:14.171
I'm going to Olympic and Fountain...

18:14.359 --> 18:15.565
Oh! I'm burning.

18:16.061 --> 18:17.165
Who is gonna clean this?

18:18.063 --> 18:19.167
Who is gonna clean this?

18:19.698 --> 18:23.043
Just relax! It's Christmas Eve!
Where is your Christmas spirit?

18:25.237 --> 18:28.514
It's Christmas... It's Christmas Eve!

18:34.413 --> 18:35.448
Move!

18:36.148 --> 18:37.456
You fucking animals!

19:34.439 --> 19:36.612
- I wanna ride it!
- He is gonna pay for it!

19:36.808 --> 19:38.082
Like a trick nigger!

19:38.377 --> 19:40.015
- I wanna ride it!
- Like a trick nigger!

19:40.212 --> 19:41.350
He's gonna pay for it!

19:42.548 --> 19:43.652
Go in, bitch!

19:43.882 --> 19:45.418
I heard his dick is little.

19:46.218 --> 19:47.629
Is it little?

19:47.886 --> 19:49.297
I mean, damn.

19:49.555 --> 19:51.823
Wow, what the fuck is going on?

19:53.458 --> 19:55.267
Going in, mommy... Oh, my...

19:56.361 --> 19:57.806
I make silicone boobs. What do you need?

19:58.030 --> 19:59.134
You don't have a baby daddy though.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.338
- Bitch...
- You better go get fight, honey.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.639
I was fucking your piece
the other night.

20:04.836 --> 20:06.238
Tell him to run me those diapers, bitch.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.084
Don't forget my performance at seven.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.617
- Oh, yeah.
- That bitch looks two months pregnant.

20:16.815 --> 20:18.852
How she going to come out here
looking like a shitty ass.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.359
Ugly ass bitches.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.794
- Is that Louie or Houie?
- She had my date, girl,

20:22.988 --> 20:24.524
and he said that her tucker stink.

20:24.823 --> 20:26.700
- No!
- You lying.

20:26.892 --> 20:29.498
She asked for $80
and he is a $900 a date.

20:29.928 --> 20:31.236
- Shut up, please.
- The bitch is stupid.

20:47.212 --> 20:48.714
Dude, your cab reeks.

20:48.947 --> 20:50.585
I know, I'm sorry about that.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.225
We are almost there.

21:01.059 --> 21:02.265
It's hardly doing anything.

21:13.071 --> 21:14.209
Let me see your dick.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.610
- Why?
- You already know the routine.

21:16.875 --> 21:18.377
I want to make sure you are not a cop.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.048
I'm not a cop.

21:24.449 --> 21:25.860
What can I do for you today?

21:26.385 --> 21:28.626
- I just want to have some fun.
- What kind of fun?

21:29.421 --> 21:32.027
I was thinking maybe BBBJ?

21:33.925 --> 21:36.030
I can suck your dick
with a condom for 80.

21:39.097 --> 21:41.873
I can give you everything I have.

21:42.901 --> 21:44.437
- Forty fucking dollars?
- Oh, come on.

21:44.603 --> 21:45.673
- Are you serious?
- Come on, come on.

21:45.871 --> 21:47.509
My family is driving me fucking
crazy, I just gotta get off.

21:47.706 --> 21:48.946
- That's not any of my concern.
- Okay, okay.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.553
Listen. I can do all the work myself
and jerk myself off.

21:51.743 --> 21:53.882
Maybe you can just grab
my balls or something.

21:54.079 --> 21:56.218
Please, I will be super-fast.

21:56.415 --> 21:58.417
I just, I just need...

21:58.950 --> 22:00.930
- Come on, it's Christmas.
- You know what?

22:02.020 --> 22:05.467
Since it is Christmas,
and I do need the money,

22:06.425 --> 22:07.631
I'll do this.

22:07.859 --> 22:09.099
But you better come fast.

22:09.294 --> 22:11.001
Run me my money, put it on the dash.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.638
Quickly...

22:33.652 --> 22:35.859
- Hey, guys. Have you seen Chester?
- Who?

22:36.054 --> 22:37.032
Chester, Chester.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.835
Him and his fucking whores?

22:39.024 --> 22:40.799
I don't do that anymore.
Even when I see Chester,

22:40.992 --> 22:43.165
- I don't want to see Chester.
- Oh, you don't do dope no more?

22:43.462 --> 22:45.305
So this is the fucking silver living
line now?

22:45.497 --> 22:46.805
It's not the fucking food line.

22:47.833 --> 22:49.972
- You should ask Bob.
- Who the fuck is Bob?

22:50.168 --> 22:52.341
The old man from the line.
He is a regular with Chester's girls.

22:52.537 --> 22:55.347
Looks like Santa without a beard.
I've been clean for 30 days.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.019
- I got my chip.
- Don't give a shit.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.855
Can you just, give it
a little stroke, please?

23:07.052 --> 23:09.555
Can you shut the hell up?
No, you didn't pay for that.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.892
- Come on just...
- No, no. You get what you pay for.

23:12.157 --> 23:14.398
- This is what you paid for.
- Come on, you know you want it.

23:16.828 --> 23:17.806
You see right through me, don't you?

23:17.996 --> 23:18.974
Oh, yeah.

23:19.197 --> 23:21.643
Bob, Bob. Are you Bob?

23:21.833 --> 23:23.210
No? Who the fuck is Bob?

23:23.735 --> 23:25.078
- Who's Bob? Who's Bob?
- I'm Bob.

23:27.038 --> 23:29.245
- Come on.
- Shut the fuck up.

23:29.708 --> 23:30.846
You're not even hard yet.

23:31.443 --> 23:33.013
I'm fucking hard. Shut up.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.486
Is that it? That's hard?

23:35.680 --> 23:37.853
Fuck off, fuck this.
It's not fucking working.

23:38.049 --> 23:40.188
Okay but give me... Run me my shit.

23:40.385 --> 23:42.422
Just get the fuck out.
Just get the fuck out.

23:42.687 --> 23:43.757
It's not working, okay.
There is no deal.

23:43.955 --> 23:45.332
I'm not going anywhere
until you give me my money.

23:45.524 --> 23:47.026
What? I didn't cum. You didn't get paid.

23:47.292 --> 23:50.364
- It's all cool, just get out.
- No, no, you didn't cum,

23:50.562 --> 23:52.439
but because of the fact that
I had to touch your dirty ass.

23:52.697 --> 23:54.870
Well, you ain't doing your job
so I couldn't cum.

23:55.066 --> 23:57.876
It's enough fuckin' around.
No, I'm not going anywhere.

23:58.069 --> 24:00.379
- Give me my shit.
- Get the fuck out of my car.

24:00.572 --> 24:01.676
Give me my shit.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.781
- Get the fuck out.
- OK, you know what?

24:03.975 --> 24:05.352
Get the fuck... Give me my fucking keys.

24:05.544 --> 24:07.114
- Nope.
- Not fucking funny goddamn it.

24:07.646 --> 24:08.852
Give me my fucking keys.

24:09.047 --> 24:10.685
Not fucking funny.

24:10.882 --> 24:11.883
You're not getting your fucking keys.

24:12.083 --> 24:13.289
- Give me...
- You're not getting these...

24:13.485 --> 24:14.725
Get off, get... Get the fuck off me.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.228
- Give me them fucking keys.
- No.

24:16.721 --> 24:17.699
What...

24:20.058 --> 24:22.038
You forget I got a dick, too.

24:22.427 --> 24:23.497
Come here.

24:24.429 --> 24:26.306
- Delee. Delila, Daphanie?
- Oh.

24:26.498 --> 24:28.102
Something starting with a D. Come on. D.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.042
- Oh, Dana.
- I guess that's it. Where is she?

24:31.269 --> 24:32.475
You know where they're at?

24:32.804 --> 24:35.045
A few days ago, she was at the Grand.

24:35.740 --> 24:37.413
- Off of Vermont.
- Classy!

24:43.248 --> 24:44.659
- Right? Simple.
- Sure.

24:45.083 --> 24:47.825
She comes back,
takes a piece of broccoli,

24:48.019 --> 24:49.828
eats it and was like...
"Oh, I don't think I like this."

24:50.021 --> 24:52.001
And I'm like, "You haven't even
eaten any food yet."

24:52.791 --> 24:54.464
So that was the beginning of it.

24:54.793 --> 24:57.637
- After lunch...
- You stay with her, okay.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.831
I stay with her, we go outside.

25:00.098 --> 25:01.509
Next door, to the coffee shop.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.179
I get Thai iced teas.

25:03.435 --> 25:05.108
And I put them down.

25:05.337 --> 25:08.250
- She drinks out of my straw.
- Nice.

25:08.440 --> 25:09.851
Just classy, huh?

25:10.041 --> 25:11.850
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, speaking of classy.

25:12.043 --> 25:13.852
- Nice, Oh, jeez.
- Oh, boy.

25:14.045 --> 25:15.854
- Fucking Alexander.
- Oh, boy.

25:16.047 --> 25:17.924
- Have you not worked with Alexander?
- No.

25:18.316 --> 25:20.262
- Please help me.
- Get off the car.

25:20.452 --> 25:23.456
- Off the fucking car.
- Get off me, help.

25:24.055 --> 25:25.796
Well, here is your chance,
if you want to go meet him.

25:25.991 --> 25:27.937
- Nice try.
- Please help. Help me, Officer.

25:28.126 --> 25:32.131
Alexandra, Alexandra.
It's enough, let him go.

25:32.464 --> 25:34.205
- What's going on?
- This lady just attacked me.

25:34.399 --> 25:36.777
- He owes me fucking money.
- Is it true?

25:37.002 --> 25:38.310
No, I don't even know her.

25:38.803 --> 25:40.646
I got out of my car and she attacked me.

25:40.906 --> 25:43.386
So a random woman just grabs you
and attacks you.

25:43.575 --> 25:44.713
- Yes.
- Yes.

25:44.910 --> 25:46.355
Check the pulse.

25:47.245 --> 25:48.223
Alexander.

25:48.647 --> 25:50.854
Girl, what the fuck?
You know I don't do that shit.

25:51.049 --> 25:53.051
I don't know. What's happening?

25:53.251 --> 25:54.525
- He owes me money.
- I don't owe you money.

25:54.719 --> 25:56.198
- Forty dollars.
- Forty dollars?

25:56.388 --> 25:57.366
I don't even know her.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.695
- Why does he owe you $40?
- He knows me very well.

25:59.925 --> 26:00.995
Ask him.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.339
Is that your green Passat?

26:04.195 --> 26:05.196
Yeah.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.308
Well we have seen you cruising around
for at least 45 minutes.

26:07.532 --> 26:08.875
- I...
- So you didn't just park it

26:09.067 --> 26:10.205
- and come down
- I just... I...

26:10.402 --> 26:11.904
Like ten minutes ago
I was driving around.

26:12.103 --> 26:14.083
- I was on the phone. I realized...
- I've seen it. You know what, sir?

26:14.306 --> 26:15.512
I shouldn't be talking
and driving the car.

26:15.707 --> 26:16.879
That's it. That's it.

26:17.709 --> 26:18.847
Why does he owe you money?

26:19.044 --> 26:20.717
We made a business transaction.

26:22.614 --> 26:25.390
A business transaction? OK.
This is what's gonna happen.

26:26.051 --> 26:28.861
It's Christmas Eve.
We'll all go our separate ways.

26:29.054 --> 26:31.864
Because I think that's a lot easier
than calling our family

26:32.057 --> 26:34.401
and trying to explain why we have
to be bailed out of jail.

26:34.626 --> 26:35.900
What family?

27:07.158 --> 27:10.264
Yeah. We know.
You posted a lot at the center.

27:10.495 --> 27:12.099
Yes. At Mary's.

27:12.664 --> 27:14.041
- 7:00pm.
- 7:00.

27:14.232 --> 27:16.212
OK. Thank you girls. I'll see you there.

27:22.440 --> 27:23.578
No, no, no.

28:02.547 --> 28:04.288
- Can I help you?
- You working?

28:04.516 --> 28:06.462
- Are you a cop?
- No, no. Get in.

28:15.193 --> 28:17.173
Make a right, right here on Las Palmas.

28:17.495 --> 28:18.599
I like right here.

28:19.297 --> 28:22.278
No. It's really busy
on the streets today, so...

28:45.857 --> 28:47.234
Are you from around here?

28:51.062 --> 28:52.200
No.

28:52.497 --> 28:53.703
I haven't seen you before.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.002
You are beautiful.

29:04.008 --> 29:05.043
What about right here?

29:05.243 --> 29:07.314
No. The block is hot over here.

29:07.779 --> 29:10.020
There's a spot two blocks up.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.404
OK. To the left right here.

29:27.065 --> 29:31.673
So... It's so nice to see some
fresh faces out here.

29:33.571 --> 29:34.777
What's your name?

29:35.607 --> 29:38.019
It's whatever you want it to be.

29:38.243 --> 29:41.019
- Yeah?
- What... What can I help you with?

29:41.379 --> 29:44.360
You girls usually have some
exotic names.

29:45.817 --> 29:46.852
Selena.

29:47.051 --> 29:48.462
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.029
Where you from?

29:53.057 --> 29:55.628
Does it really matter where I'm from?

29:55.927 --> 29:57.463
You new? New in town?

29:59.230 --> 30:00.971
I'm from Santa Clarita.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.042
Can we do some French, please? Here.

30:10.008 --> 30:10.986
Cool?

30:13.011 --> 30:14.046
Are these real?

30:14.245 --> 30:15.280
Yeah, they're real.

30:18.983 --> 30:20.462
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

30:21.853 --> 30:23.560
No, no, no. No, no, no. Wait

30:23.755 --> 30:25.098
I go down.

30:25.356 --> 30:26.733
Pull it out. Pull it out.

30:28.326 --> 30:29.430
Pull it out.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.103
What's wrong?

30:37.101 --> 30:38.171
What's wrong?

30:40.138 --> 30:41.981
- Is it tucked?
- Is it tucked?

30:42.273 --> 30:44.446
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck is this?

30:44.676 --> 30:45.916
It's a pussy.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.291
Get the fuck out of my car.

30:49.514 --> 30:50.788
Give me my money.
Where did you put my money?

30:50.982 --> 30:52.017
What the fuck is your problem, dude?

30:52.217 --> 30:53.321
Get the fuck out of my car.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.259
- That block you were hanging on?
- What a waste of my time.

30:55.453 --> 30:56.659
That's not for pussies.

30:57.155 --> 30:58.361
Alright? You shouldn't be there.

30:58.556 --> 31:01.264
- Fucking homo, man.
- Get out of my fucking car.

31:01.459 --> 31:03.200
- That's the wrong track for you.
- Fuck you, dude.

31:03.461 --> 31:06.340
Don't work that track.
Close the door. Close the door!

31:06.564 --> 31:07.941
Fuck you!

31:32.590 --> 31:34.399
Scotty? Scotty?

31:34.926 --> 31:36.166
What number is the party room?

31:49.040 --> 31:50.075
So, me and my sisters...

31:50.608 --> 31:53.020
Every weekend we would go down
to this skating rink,

31:53.411 --> 31:55.721
and every Friday night they
would have like a disco theme,

31:55.947 --> 31:58.018
but you would have to bring,
like, a guy...

31:58.216 --> 32:01.556
And could never find a guy to go with
me, so I had to dance with my sisters.

32:26.044 --> 32:27.114
Hold on.

32:34.953 --> 32:35.954
Yeah?

32:36.454 --> 32:37.865
Chester has any girls here?

32:38.056 --> 32:40.195
Maybe. And who are you?

32:40.425 --> 32:41.529
Does Chester have any girls here?

32:41.759 --> 32:43.864
- Who the fuck are you?
- Dana?

32:44.329 --> 32:46.866
- I'm not Dana
- No, no, no. I'm looking for Dana.

32:47.065 --> 32:48.635
There ain't no Dana here.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.071
Dinah?

32:52.337 --> 32:53.714
Oh, shit!

32:54.605 --> 32:57.449
What the fuck are you doing?
Get the fuck out!

32:57.675 --> 32:59.154
- Where's fucking Dinah?
- Who cares?

32:59.344 --> 33:00.755
- Get the fuck out.
- Where the fuck is Dinah?

33:01.446 --> 33:02.584
Where she at, girl?

33:02.780 --> 33:04.623
She's in there.
But you're not going in there.

33:04.849 --> 33:06.988
- Watch me, bitch!
- Get the fuck out!

33:08.820 --> 33:11.096
- Dinah! Dinah!
- Get the fuck out of here!

33:11.356 --> 33:13.097
That's where she's at!
She's fucking blonde!

33:13.358 --> 33:14.837
- Where's she at?
- Get the fuck out.

33:15.026 --> 33:16.835
She's in the bathroom! I'm sorry, guys!

33:17.028 --> 33:18.405
Dinah? Dinah?

33:18.830 --> 33:19.831
Fucking Dinah!

33:20.031 --> 33:21.169
Right here! In there!

33:22.200 --> 33:24.009
What? Hey! Hey!

33:35.046 --> 33:36.855
Who are you?

33:37.515 --> 33:38.619
What do you want?

33:52.230 --> 33:53.504
Oh, my God.

33:54.665 --> 33:57.305
Guys, shut the fuck up! Shut up!

33:58.036 --> 33:59.845
We have neighbors, alright?

34:00.038 --> 34:02.279
- I'm not getting kicked out.
- Is that crazy bitch coming back?

34:02.473 --> 34:05.181
She's not coming back.
That's what I'm telling you.

34:05.376 --> 34:06.548
She's not coming back.

34:06.744 --> 34:09.350
Girls, go! Go back in the other room!
Go! Go!

34:09.547 --> 34:10.685
I better get a freebie next time!

34:10.882 --> 34:12.690
No! You're not getting a freebie,
alright?

34:13.051 --> 34:14.393
Did you want me to call the cops?

34:15.219 --> 34:16.219
Yeah, genius.

34:16.420 --> 34:18.628
Let's get the whole precinct
down here, you motherfucker!

34:26.831 --> 34:28.811
You have the wrong person!

34:29.699 --> 34:30.838
What's your name?

34:31.034 --> 34:32.013
Dinah!

34:32.203 --> 34:33.909
Dinah, Dinah, Dinah, Dinah!

34:47.585 --> 34:48.859
Razmik!

34:49.053 --> 34:51.090
Hey! Alexandra, come here!

34:52.723 --> 34:54.498
I'm so fucking happy to see you today.

34:54.725 --> 34:57.331
Oh, my God. You will not believe
what I have been through!

34:57.528 --> 34:59.599
What happened? Get in.

35:04.068 --> 35:06.048
What a sight for sore eyes!

35:09.040 --> 35:11.111
Thanks for helping, you motherfucker!

35:11.375 --> 35:13.912
- Hurry up! Come on!
- Ow!

35:14.645 --> 35:17.455
This is like the second time
this month that this happened to me.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.122
I'm tired of being fucking nice
to people.

35:20.318 --> 35:21.956
I've got some money for you.
Don't worry, man.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.627
I think this is becoming
our favorite spot.

35:29.894 --> 35:30.872
Yeah.

35:37.068 --> 35:39.048
- Hi.
- Just the wash.

37:37.588 --> 37:38.999
I don't know what's going on
with your man,

37:39.190 --> 37:41.033
but it has nothing to do with me!

37:41.459 --> 37:42.870
Who are you talking about?

37:43.060 --> 37:45.040
Fucking name? You want a fucking name?

37:45.229 --> 37:46.708
How about a fucking name?

37:47.031 --> 37:48.374
You know what you're going
to get from me?

37:48.599 --> 37:51.671
Me, you and him are gonna have
a little sit down, a little chit-chat

37:51.869 --> 37:52.870
about what's really fucking going on.

37:53.070 --> 37:54.208
Who the fuck is him?

37:54.538 --> 37:56.882
I got eight dates a day! Just tell me...

38:07.752 --> 38:09.287
Merry Christmas.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.456
You didn't have to do this.

38:12.556 --> 38:13.762
Yes, I did.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.036
What's that?

38:20.231 --> 38:21.869
My performance.
It's going to be at 7:00.

38:22.066 --> 38:23.875
All of my favorite people
are going to be there.

38:24.068 --> 38:26.105
Miss Sin-Dee. And Miss Dani....

38:26.337 --> 38:28.874
Wait. Wait. Sin-Dee? Which Sin-Dee?

38:29.440 --> 38:30.578
Sin-Dee Rella.

38:30.775 --> 38:31.879
Looks like someone has a crush.

38:32.076 --> 38:33.487
Sin-Dee's back on the block?

38:33.678 --> 38:36.981
Oh, yeah. She's back.
She's back and she's going hard.

38:41.252 --> 38:43.596
- Come here!
- Fuck you!

38:44.021 --> 38:45.625
See you later on tonight. I have to go.

38:45.823 --> 38:47.166
- Bye.
- OK. Take care.

38:51.028 --> 38:52.837
Say you're not gonna run away
on me again!

38:53.030 --> 38:54.407
Not gonna run away.

38:56.033 --> 38:57.603
All right. We're in agreement.

38:57.835 --> 38:59.178
Bring your fucking ass.

39:23.060 --> 39:25.768
She's getting skinnier and skinnier.

39:25.963 --> 39:28.170
Everyone comes to America and gets fat.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.573
Even I gained weight.

39:30.735 --> 39:33.011
But this girl gets skinnier.

39:33.270 --> 39:35.750
I don't gain or lose.

39:36.273 --> 39:39.345
You always weigh the same.

39:39.577 --> 39:42.854
Mom, I'm sorry. I spilled a little bit.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.024
Where are the fruits? Fruits.

39:47.318 --> 39:49.264
Coming right up.

39:50.321 --> 39:53.123
She loves that dog.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.466
She loves that dog very much.

39:56.794 --> 39:58.774
I don't like dogs.

40:01.565 --> 40:04.045
Maybe I'll get used to it.

40:04.902 --> 40:06.779
Everything requires getting used to.

40:06.971 --> 40:09.110
You'll get used to a lot more than that.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.550
Again you want to smoke?

40:14.912 --> 40:17.051
Eat something. Please help yourself.

40:23.020 --> 40:24.055
How are you, Razmik?

40:24.255 --> 40:25.791
Good. How are you?

40:25.990 --> 40:27.230
Good. Thank God.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.961
How is Ashot?

40:29.160 --> 40:30.730
Good. He's growing old... With me.

40:31.829 --> 40:33.433
Any business out there today?

40:41.806 --> 40:44.082
Let her grow up a little
and then Yeva can start working also.

40:45.209 --> 40:49.680
Well, I came here to help
with the child so they can work.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.158
That's the right thing to do.

40:52.383 --> 40:54.829
That's what grandmothers are for.

40:55.052 --> 40:59.762
So they can help take care
of my sweetie pie.

40:59.957 --> 41:02.665
Ashken, she looks like you.

41:02.893 --> 41:05.533
No, she looks more like Razmik.

41:05.796 --> 41:07.366
Especially her smile.

41:08.032 --> 41:10.012
Come here, sweetie.

41:10.234 --> 41:12.009
Come and sit with Daddy.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.847
Come on!

41:19.143 --> 41:21.487
Shut the fuck up!
What are you crying for?

41:21.679 --> 41:22.953
Shut the fuck up!

41:24.482 --> 41:25.825
Get your fucking ass in here!

41:26.350 --> 41:28.956
Hello! Where is he at?
Where's your fucking friend?

41:29.153 --> 41:30.928
Is this the person you
were talking about?

41:31.288 --> 41:32.995
You need to help me! Call Chester!

41:33.257 --> 41:34.600
You gotta call Chester!

41:34.792 --> 41:35.827
What have you done to her?

41:36.026 --> 41:37.630
Yeah, Chester! Where's Chester?

41:37.828 --> 41:39.102
Chester's not gonna be cool
with this shit!

41:39.530 --> 41:40.508
You know Chester?

41:40.698 --> 41:41.836
Yes, I know Chester!

41:42.032 --> 41:43.102
Why me? What did I do?

41:43.300 --> 41:45.007
You gotta get her the fuck out of here!

41:45.536 --> 41:47.447
Shut the fuck up! Where's Chester?

41:47.638 --> 41:49.083
I'm not leaving unless
you tell me where he is...

41:49.273 --> 41:50.843
Calm down! He's at Donut Time!

41:51.375 --> 41:53.013
At Donut Time! Great!

41:53.878 --> 41:55.084
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

41:55.513 --> 41:59.090
Alright. When you see him, could you
kinda not tell him that I'm the one

41:59.283 --> 42:02.025
that kinda told you that he was there?

42:03.821 --> 42:05.767
Time to make the donuts, bitch.

42:18.469 --> 42:19.447
Fuck up!

42:20.671 --> 42:24.118
You know what?
I want to see Chester right now!

42:24.341 --> 42:25.843
I can't wait to see that motherfucker!

42:26.043 --> 42:27.852
He doesn't like you. You aren't special.

42:28.579 --> 42:29.614
I know I ain't special,

42:29.813 --> 42:31.850
but I'm his bottom bitch
for the last two weeks, bitch!

42:32.049 --> 42:33.653
And when he finds out what the hell
you been doing to me,

42:33.851 --> 42:37.389
I swear to God, he's going to rip
that cheap ass wig off your head

42:37.655 --> 42:40.295
and shove it up your
fucking gaping asshole!

42:59.510 --> 43:02.551
You might be his bottom bitch, but
I'm his girlfriend, you fucking whore!

43:02.813 --> 43:04.622
Oh, my fucking God!

43:04.782 --> 43:07.422
You're Chester's girlfriend?
Is that what you fucking think?

43:07.618 --> 43:08.926
Chester's got a lot
of motherfucking girlfriends

43:09.119 --> 43:10.427
and you are definitely not one of them!

43:10.688 --> 43:11.689
What the fuck do I look like?

43:11.889 --> 43:13.869
Like y'all niggas are going
to Red Lobster and shit!

43:14.058 --> 43:15.662
Oh, this my boyfriend!

43:16.060 --> 43:18.040
You are so mad pathetic right now!

43:18.429 --> 43:21.035
You're like home like waiting
for him to call and shit.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.078
That's sad. That's fucking sad.

43:23.300 --> 43:25.246
I'm getting dragged around
this fucking city is not as sad

43:25.536 --> 43:28.608
as you sitting home thinking your
Chester's motherfucking girlfriend!

43:32.076 --> 43:33.953
I'mma perform. Don't worry.

43:36.714 --> 43:38.523
It's gonna blow your fucking mind.

43:45.589 --> 43:48.092
Getting my fucking hair thing.
Is that OK with you?

43:52.463 --> 43:53.874
Girlfriend.

43:54.064 --> 43:56.635
Shit. Fucking pathetic.

43:57.167 --> 43:58.441
Girlfriend.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.877
What time is it?
What fucking time is it?

44:01.572 --> 44:02.573
What time is it?

44:08.445 --> 44:09.446
Fuck!

44:15.019 --> 44:18.000
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

44:20.024 --> 44:21.833
I'm gonna put Kool-Aid on.
That's gonna be it.

44:22.526 --> 44:24.665
She goes on forever.
You know she goes on forever.

44:32.136 --> 44:34.173
We're at Donut Time, fucking retard!

44:34.438 --> 44:36.315
We've got something else to do first.

44:37.474 --> 44:40.011
- They'll be here.
- Your fans are not here.

44:40.844 --> 44:41.982
Alright, Miss Crawford?

44:42.179 --> 44:44.659
You're going with me.
You've got no fucking choice, OK?

44:44.848 --> 44:46.327
Is it a double date with Chester?

44:46.517 --> 44:48.190
'Cause I would really fucking love that.

44:52.656 --> 44:55.466
Come on, we're buddies now.
We're buddies. We suck the same cock.

45:00.030 --> 45:02.442
How much you cost?
How much can I buy you for, huh?

45:03.534 --> 45:04.842
How much you take me out for out there?

45:05.035 --> 45:07.276
Look at your nasty clothes.
You couldn't afford it.

45:07.838 --> 45:08.839
My nasty clothes?

45:09.039 --> 45:10.313
What's this? Tricks 'R Us?

45:11.241 --> 45:13.016
Listen, sweetheart, I'm bumping you.

45:13.977 --> 45:15.183
Next year, OK?

45:16.814 --> 45:18.020
Come on. Move your ass.

45:20.050 --> 45:24.021
Ali, girl! Alexandra, girl!
I'm here, girl!

45:25.422 --> 45:28.232
I'm tired, let's go! I didn't think
I was gonna make it here on time!

45:28.525 --> 45:29.868
What the fuck is this?

45:30.194 --> 45:33.141
Girl, how late am I? I'm thinking
I'm five minutes late, right?

45:34.031 --> 45:35.533
What did you do to her?

45:35.733 --> 45:38.009
Don't worry about her.
You gotta go on stage. Come on!

45:42.039 --> 45:43.177
OK.

45:45.042 --> 45:47.022
Look. My friends are here.

45:48.378 --> 45:50.016
Come on. Just come on.

45:50.380 --> 45:51.859
How you doing?

45:52.049 --> 45:53.255
This one has one shoe!

45:53.450 --> 45:55.828
She's from the hills. She hillbilly.
Come on, girl!

45:56.019 --> 45:58.727
Merry Christmas.

45:58.922 --> 46:01.334
Good to see you.

46:05.129 --> 46:06.904
Come here, baby.

46:07.097 --> 46:08.576
Has she eaten?

46:08.766 --> 46:12.976
She doesn't eat this kind of food.
I will feed her later.

46:13.971 --> 46:17.578
Let's toast to the head
of this household.

46:19.610 --> 46:23.183
All the best to you and your family.

46:24.181 --> 46:26.354
Thank you. Wishing you the same.

46:26.617 --> 46:28.961
To your health.

46:29.153 --> 46:31.599
Ashken, you have a great son-in-law.

46:35.025 --> 46:37.869
He's great but he gets tired too much.

46:38.762 --> 46:40.264
I don't know what the fuck
I'm gonna do with this hair.

46:40.464 --> 46:42.705
It's super straight
like those fucking Asian hos.

46:43.167 --> 46:44.373
Is that how you like it?

46:45.068 --> 46:46.706
Yeah. Sometimes. But not all the time.

46:46.904 --> 46:48.577
It don't have to always be like that.
Let me do this.

46:48.772 --> 46:52.151
Yeah. Fix your face. Fix that mug.
That's what everybody is looking at.

46:52.476 --> 46:54.922
- I need to get these eyebrows done.
- Yes, you do.

46:57.147 --> 46:59.218
You know... Why did you bring her here?

47:00.584 --> 47:01.995
Fuck her. We ain't worried about her.

47:02.186 --> 47:03.824
She ain't nobody. Today's about you.

47:04.021 --> 47:06.467
Why you so up on her anyways?
With that fucked up face of yours.

47:06.657 --> 47:07.829
Look at her!

47:08.025 --> 47:10.005
You didn't have to Chris Brown
the bitch!

47:10.494 --> 47:12.997
I told you what I had to do today.
You act like I was playing.

47:13.197 --> 47:15.302
You know when I say shit,
I mean it, girl.

47:16.800 --> 47:18.507
You wanna go onstage looking like this?

47:19.036 --> 47:21.016
What, exactly, are you implying?

47:21.205 --> 47:25.017
I imply that you use some of my eye.
And let me do what I need to do.

47:27.044 --> 47:28.284
Do you want my help or not?

47:30.047 --> 47:32.254
Your highlight's all fucked off, girl.

47:32.649 --> 47:33.855
You need to learn how to blend.

47:34.051 --> 47:37.032
Your chestnuts are roasting on
the bottom of your chinny-chin-chin.

47:38.021 --> 47:39.830
What exactly are you doing to my face?

47:40.023 --> 47:41.832
Trying to make you look better
than what you looked like before.

47:42.326 --> 47:43.430
You tried it.

47:44.027 --> 47:45.165
Yo.

47:46.029 --> 47:47.804
- I'm just... I'm so over it.
- Yo!

47:47.998 --> 47:49.170
I don't even know what to do.

47:49.900 --> 47:51.709
- Yo!
- Bitch, what the fuck you want?

48:02.045 --> 48:03.547
Finish your own make-up.
You know how I taught you:

48:03.747 --> 48:05.385
Highlight, highlight, highlight,
contour.

48:05.582 --> 48:07.027
Blush, blemish, bomb, bam!

48:07.217 --> 48:09.060
Just stay over there.
I don't want to smell that shit!

48:09.253 --> 48:12.331
I'm trying to enjoy it in peace, please.
I had a stressful day today.

48:13.423 --> 48:14.868
Come on! Yo. That's my shit.

48:15.058 --> 48:16.036
It's my pipe.

48:19.763 --> 48:20.741
I can feel it.

48:22.666 --> 48:23.838
Oh, girl, hit her. Hit her.

48:24.034 --> 48:25.069
She's smoking' up.

48:25.269 --> 48:27.749
You gonna bring this bitch here,
and now you smoking this shit!

48:41.785 --> 48:43.264
Where the fuck is the red lip gloss?

48:44.655 --> 48:46.794
Girl, you seen it. I know you did.

48:47.024 --> 48:48.196
That's for real...

48:48.392 --> 48:49.427
Chester took it.

48:50.127 --> 48:51.333
Took it like a champ.

48:51.595 --> 48:53.541
Let me tell you,
Chester is a natural born sailor.

48:53.797 --> 48:55.208
If you trying to upset me
it's not gonna work.

48:55.399 --> 48:56.571
I give zero fucks about you and Chester.

48:56.800 --> 48:59.872
Oh, bra! He was all he could be
when he joined my Navy!

49:00.070 --> 49:01.515
Does your friend ever shut up?

49:02.039 --> 49:05.020
No. That bitch been talking
ever since I met her.

49:55.425 --> 49:59.669
<i>Toyland</i>

50:00.430 --> 50:03.843
<i>Toyland</i>

50:05.202 --> 50:09.309
<i>Little girl</i>

50:09.840 --> 50:14.118

50:57.654 --> 51:00.400

- Yes.

51:01.525 --> 51:03.198
No, she broke. She ain't got no money.

51:03.593 --> 51:06.039
<i>Again</i>

51:06.329 --> 51:08.400
- Do you want a drink?
- Yes!

51:09.032 --> 51:11.342
- I'll bring you some water.
- Is it free?

51:11.535 --> 51:12.878
Yes. Water is free.

52:01.051 --> 52:02.792

- Go Alexandra, girl!

52:02.986 --> 52:04.897
- Thank you, everyone.
- Everybody clap!

52:05.789 --> 52:07.029
Clap! Clap for her!

52:07.824 --> 52:08.859
Thank you.

52:09.059 --> 52:13.064
Girl, that's right. She did that.
Yes! She did that.

52:13.263 --> 52:14.936
This next one is one of my favorites.

52:15.132 --> 52:16.440
I hope it's one of yours.

52:16.666 --> 52:17.974
Shit. I need some more
of that shit, girl.

52:18.168 --> 52:19.306
Yeah, let's go.

52:23.473 --> 52:24.975
I'm going to go to work.

52:25.742 --> 52:26.516
Now?

52:27.711 --> 52:29.349
Yes, I didn't earn a penny today.

52:29.546 --> 52:30.684
But we're eating.

52:30.881 --> 52:33.225
- So what?
- It's Christmas Eve.

52:33.483 --> 52:34.723
So what?

52:35.485 --> 52:38.329
I have no patience for her.
Make sure she doesn't make a fuss.

52:38.588 --> 52:40.124
I'll take care of it.

52:44.394 --> 52:45.998
Forgive me, but I have to go to work.

52:46.229 --> 52:50.368
What do you mean you have to leave?
You just got home.

52:50.867 --> 52:54.041
I haven't made a penny today.
I'm going to work for a few hours.

52:54.271 --> 52:57.013
It's Christmas and I have guests.

52:57.207 --> 52:58.151
It's okay, Mom.

52:58.341 --> 52:59.581
It's okay. You don't have
to make money today.

52:59.776 --> 53:00.811
It's Christmas.

53:01.011 --> 53:01.989
What do you mean?

53:02.179 --> 53:03.419
If I don't make money, how do we live?

53:03.613 --> 53:05.422
- It's okay, Mom.
- It's Christmas Eve.

53:05.849 --> 53:09.524
Christmas is for Americans.
For us, it's another work day.

53:09.753 --> 53:10.857
You live in America now.

53:11.121 --> 53:12.759
Can you please tell her
to close her mouth, please?

53:12.956 --> 53:13.957
I'm not in the mood for this.

53:14.124 --> 53:16.161
What did he say?

53:16.593 --> 53:18.504
Yeva, what did he say?

53:18.728 --> 53:20.901
He said he must go.

53:21.131 --> 53:23.441
He speaks English
but he doesn't celebrate Christmas.

53:23.633 --> 53:26.011
He should have stayed home tonight.

53:28.271 --> 53:30.444
I know but his real Christmas
is on the 6th.

53:30.740 --> 53:32.344
Today isn't his real Christmas.

53:33.276 --> 53:34.687
He was the only man at the table.

53:34.945 --> 53:37.221
He was pouring us cognac.
Now we have to pour it ourselves.

53:37.414 --> 53:39.860
Mom, he's the only one working
and supporting this household.

53:40.116 --> 53:43.461
Let's not let this ruin our night.

55:25.121 --> 55:26.828
Hey! It's that guy!

55:27.324 --> 55:29.270
- Bye!
- Thank you so much.

55:29.859 --> 55:30.837
Okay.

55:44.541 --> 55:45.918
You did good, girl.
You sound good tonight, girl.

55:46.109 --> 55:47.315
She sound good, right?
She sound good, girl.

55:47.510 --> 55:48.648
Tell her she sound good.

55:48.845 --> 55:51.689
I mean... you did sing and you sang...

55:52.949 --> 55:54.792
Alright, I'm going to keep it real
with you right now.

55:54.984 --> 55:57.123
This is not critical,
this is not anything like rude,

55:57.354 --> 55:59.197
this is just being real with you...

56:00.023 --> 56:04.369
Honestly, it sounded a little old.
Like, it didn't sound like new music.

56:04.627 --> 56:07.039
It sounded like something I'd hear
like a long time ago,

56:07.230 --> 56:08.607
know what I'm saying? It's like...

56:08.798 --> 56:12.207
Like I know... Where I'm coming from is
I know a lot about the music industry.

56:12.402 --> 56:13.813
I know a lot of people
in the music industry.

56:14.003 --> 56:15.038
I myself sing.

56:23.546 --> 56:25.116
- Hello, sir.
- Hey.

56:25.348 --> 56:26.850
Do you know if this is still going on?

56:27.050 --> 56:30.031
Oh, look at this. That's cute.
No, she's gone.

56:33.022 --> 56:34.968
She was up. She was on. She's done.

56:36.159 --> 56:37.365
She left.

56:37.560 --> 56:39.506
She was with a friend
and her name is Sin-Dee.

56:39.696 --> 56:41.676
Oh, the train wreck
and the hot mess. Yeah.

56:42.165 --> 56:43.166
They left?

56:44.534 --> 56:46.514
What do you mean they left?
Yeah, they're gone.

56:47.270 --> 56:49.375
The cool thing is though, I mean,
look, you played in a club...

56:49.572 --> 56:51.245
you got people paying you
to play in a club.

56:51.508 --> 56:52.885
I mean, that's pretty cool.

56:55.044 --> 56:56.182
What?

56:56.546 --> 56:58.025
You don't want to talk about
how much you got?

56:58.214 --> 56:59.591
She don't want to tell me
how much she got paid.

56:59.783 --> 57:01.763
- How much did you get paid?
- Girl, she didn't get paid, girl.

57:02.018 --> 57:03.656
- She paid to sing, girl.
- What do you mean?

57:03.887 --> 57:05.195
I don't even understand
what you talking about.

57:05.388 --> 57:06.662
I can hear you.

57:08.591 --> 57:13.040
You paid... Wait.
You paid them to let you sing?

57:14.197 --> 57:15.904
That's... That's sad. Hold up.

57:16.132 --> 57:18.271
So you gave them 20 bucks and said,
"Let me sing a Christmas song?"

57:18.568 --> 57:20.741
Girl, stop, it's not like you could
do any better anyway, girl.

57:21.137 --> 57:23.811
Mother, I'm not discussing this.

57:27.877 --> 57:31.256
I'm your mother.
If I don't talk about it, who will?

57:31.448 --> 57:33.359
Mother, stop.

57:33.550 --> 57:36.531
I'm not cleaning up. I'm going to bed.

57:45.595 --> 57:47.541
Come on. Come on, girl. We're here.

57:50.500 --> 57:52.912
Hey, look who's back. Hi, baby.

57:53.102 --> 57:55.082
- I don't have time for this shit.
- Don't be a bitch about it.

57:55.271 --> 57:57.581
Yeah, you're cute.
I love your sweater, your fake purse.

57:57.807 --> 58:00.879
What is wrong with you?
Are you on something?

58:01.077 --> 58:04.781
Yes. I'm on. I'm gonna kick your
fucking ass if you talk to me again.

58:04.981 --> 58:08.622
She's been out of jail for 24 hours,
she's already causing drama.

58:09.586 --> 58:11.395
Drama!

58:12.989 --> 58:15.799
You two, stay your asses here
until I come get you.

58:16.159 --> 58:18.901
Alexandra, you better watch her,
and don't move your black ass.

58:42.719 --> 58:43.993
Girl, where you been?

58:44.387 --> 58:45.525
Chester.

58:52.862 --> 58:54.535
I thought they let your ass out at noon.

58:55.798 --> 58:57.004
Where you been all day?

59:00.370 --> 59:03.010
What? Sin-Sin, sit your ass down.

59:05.041 --> 59:10.022
You know, you could have at least
had the decency to come pick me up.

59:11.414 --> 59:13.394
Who the fuck am I gonna get
to come pick you up?

59:13.583 --> 59:15.392
You know, I got Nash working on Vermont.

59:15.685 --> 59:17.130
I got Ty on the West Side, right?

59:17.353 --> 59:19.458
I mean I be running around
taking care of business and shit,

59:19.656 --> 59:22.136
doing what I do all day.
You know, running this shit.

59:22.525 --> 59:24.004
And then, fuckin', it's...

59:24.193 --> 59:26.332
On top of that
it's motherfucking Christmas Eve.

59:26.529 --> 59:27.564
You know how these motherfuckers get...

59:27.864 --> 59:30.640
They like, fucking wanna get their
last minute shopping in and shit.

59:36.773 --> 59:41.017
I had two dollars. Two dollars.
You know what I spent it on?

59:42.579 --> 59:44.650
- What?
- The bus and a donut.

59:45.848 --> 59:49.386
Sin-Sin. Sit your ass down.

59:51.454 --> 59:53.832
It don't matter, we here now. Sit down.

59:55.758 --> 59:57.829
Did you at least get me
a Christmas present?

01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:04.844
Well, I mean, like, like yeah...

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:08.038
Like I get... our gift is like me
fucking running shit,

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:11.514
like saving money, like, 'cause
I knew you was getting out today.

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:14.084
I was gonna surprise you.

01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:15.755
Was gonna take you to Roscoe's tomorrow

01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:19.549
for maybe like a fucking, like,
a nice Christmas dinner and shit.

01:00:19.749 --> 01:00:21.194
Like, I thought that'd be special.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:25.390
What?

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:29.870
You know, I feel you. But I got you one.

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:31.434
I think you're gonna like it.

01:00:32.228 --> 01:00:33.639
And I'm gonna get it for you
right now. Hold on...

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:35.467
Where the fuck are you going?

01:00:37.266 --> 01:00:39.644
Oh, what the fuck is this shit?

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:44.950
- Fuck her! Fuck her now! Fuck her!
- Come on, man.

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:47.543
You wanna fuck her
in front of everybody, right?

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:53.218
Fuck her, come on! Fuck her!
This is what you want?

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:54.451
Alright, alright, alright!

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:57.295
Twenty eight motherfucking days and
you're out here cheating on me with fish?

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.431
- I did not cheat on you.
- You're a fucking liar!

01:00:59.622 --> 01:01:00.760
- Alright!
- Everybody on the goddamn block

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:04.437
- knew about it but me.
- Hey! I'm gonna call the cop!

01:01:07.363 --> 01:01:08.603
You want me to call the cop?

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:10.505
Mamasan, I'm sorry. I'm gonna chill
these motherfuckers out.

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:16.944
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:01:17.206 --> 01:01:19.015
Are you Armenian?

01:01:19.575 --> 01:01:20.815
Yeah.

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:23.179
- What's your name, son?
- Karo.

01:01:23.379 --> 01:01:26.223
Karo, do you know Razmik?

01:01:26.449 --> 01:01:28.053
Which Razmik?

01:01:28.251 --> 01:01:31.232
Razmik Simonian.
He is one of your drivers.

01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:32.990
Yes. Of course. I know him very well.

01:01:33.956 --> 01:01:36.766
I need you to take me to him
right away. Please.

01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:40.207
Where do you think he might be?

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:45.340
I am his mother-in-law.

01:01:46.569 --> 01:01:48.515
Oh. He should be around
the West Hollywood area.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.582
I will find him for you.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:54.453
Razmik? Razmik? Where is your location?

01:01:56.913 --> 01:01:59.291
Razmik is not working tonight.

01:01:59.782 --> 01:02:04.128
I knew it.
I told her he is not going to work.

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:06.029
What is the matter, Auntie?

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:10.035
How well do you know my son-in-law?

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.038
Mom?

01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:21.944
We will find him but we may drive
all night. Okay?

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:24.075
Yes, drive. It's okay.

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:33.822
This thing busts in and drags me
out by my hair, tries to beat my ass,

01:02:34.016 --> 01:02:35.859
then she took me to some
boring-ass drag queen show.

01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:37.258
I ain't no motherfucking drag queen!

01:02:37.453 --> 01:02:39.228
I'm losing sympathy for you
by the minute.

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:41.026
Hold up. This motherfucking commotion,

01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:42.862
this is all that shit
at The Grand was about?

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:44.663
- This bullshit right here?
- Merry Christmas.

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:47.568
- Yo, I thought that was a bust.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

01:02:47.797 --> 01:02:49.276
Hold up, listen.

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:52.207
I don't give no kinds of shit
about this bitch, alright, alright?

01:02:52.468 --> 01:02:54.846
But please, please tell me
you didn't lay a hand on Jillian?

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:56.344
Please tell me you didn't
go crazy on her?

01:02:56.572 --> 01:02:58.574
Why would I lay a hand on Jillian?
It's not like your fucking Jillian...

01:02:58.775 --> 01:02:59.913
You're fucking Jillian too, aren't you?

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:02.347
Alright! Listen, hold on.
I'm gonna have to fuck her up now too!

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:04.525
Calm down. There's been some sort
of misunderstanding here, alright?

01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:06.852
Who's name you see tattooed here? Huh?

01:03:07.049 --> 01:03:09.029
What's that say? What's that name say?

01:03:09.218 --> 01:03:10.629
What's that name say? That's your name.

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:12.628
Hey, Mamasan! Come here
and read this motherfucker.

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:13.857
What's this say?

01:03:14.056 --> 01:03:15.535
You know, you piss me the fuck off
sometimes, Chester!

01:03:15.758 --> 01:03:16.862
Hey, what's this say?

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.872
This motherfucker
don't say Dana, does it?

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:21.302
It's Dinah!

01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:23.773
Alright, I don't give a fuck what
her motherfucking name is, alright,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.971
but Boo... you have got to get
ahold of yourself, okay?

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:29.275
You be tripping.

01:03:29.505 --> 01:03:32.418
Alright? Hey look at me, look...
Who's your man?

01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:35.088
Who's heart beats for you? This heart.

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:37.251
Who's your man?
I'm your motherfucking fiancé

01:03:37.513 --> 01:03:39.823
and you can't be acting
this motherfucking crazy.

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:41.793
Did you just say fiancé?

01:03:42.018 --> 01:03:43.463
- What?
- You two are getting married?

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:45.824
You just went from half fag to full fag!

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:47.558
- Alright...
- Get your life!

01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:49.566
Shut the fuck up. Come here.
Shut the fuck up.

01:03:49.759 --> 01:03:51.636
Shut the fuck up. Shut up.

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:53.774
They said you was legit,
they didn't say you was a legit homo.

01:03:53.996 --> 01:03:55.168
Shut the fuck up, bitch.

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:56.739
You talk when I tell you
to motherfucking talk.

01:03:56.933 --> 01:03:58.844
Did he just say
you were getting married?

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:01.845
Yes, I proposed right before
she got herself arrested.

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:03.108
Before I got myself arrested?

01:04:03.306 --> 01:04:06.152
Actually you got me arrested when you
asked me to hold your teener in my weave.

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:07.980
You're like, 'Oh, Sin-Dee, the cops
are coming,

01:04:08.177 --> 01:04:09.815
- why don't you hold my teener..."
- Are you fucking serious?

01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:11.184
"I'll propose to you, we'll get married.

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:12.415
It'll be a pretty thing!"

01:04:12.615 --> 01:04:14.856
Listen, listen, listen. I can't be
getting popped on that shit,

01:04:15.051 --> 01:04:17.361
for you it's just holding,
for me it's intent to distribute.

01:04:17.553 --> 01:04:19.089
Oh, my God, that is not the T.

01:04:19.288 --> 01:04:21.325
This right here,
is this what you fucking want?

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:23.868
Okay, okay, okay. Listen, listen.
You gotta lower your voice,

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.835
they are gonna kick our
fucking stupid asses out of here.

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:27.666
Mamasan, I'm sorry, I'm gonna chill
these motherfuckers out.

01:04:27.897 --> 01:04:29.205
- Stop yelling!
- Okay.

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:30.706
This is a business!

01:04:30.967 --> 01:04:33.208
Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna buy
some donuts. Alright.

01:04:33.469 --> 01:04:34.812
I'm gonna buy some donuts,

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:39.851
and then the three of us
are gonna fuckin' chill. Chill.

01:04:40.743 --> 01:04:45.223
This weather in LA doesn't help
to set the holiday mood.

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:47.722
There's no Christmas without snow.

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:51.090
Christmas is Christmas
regardless of the weather.

01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:54.963
Feels fake.

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:57.864
Los Angeles
is a beautifully wrapped lie.

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:08.209
Agree to disagree.

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.683
I'm learning English.

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:15.412
- Mamasan, I like your hair.
- Alright.

01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:17.557
What do you want? Hurry up.

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:20.349
- Do you have watermelon flavor?
- No.

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:22.085
Don't you think we should be
getting the Christmas donuts?

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:24.926
I mean it's motherfucking Christmas Eve.
Like, let's celebrate.

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:28.092
Mamasan, does your husband
ever cheat on you?

01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:31.067
- Who's gonna marry her smiling ass?
- The one who order her offline.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.365
- Look how happy she is.
- Hurry up, I have another costumer.

01:05:33.562 --> 01:05:34.700
- OK.
- What do you want?

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:45.884
Can you come here a second?
Just one second.

01:05:49.979 --> 01:05:51.788
- Hey, baby, how's it going?
- Hey. How are ya?

01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:53.754
I'm wonderful. Are you ready for me?

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:55.861
Listen, have you seen Sin-Dee tonight?

01:05:56.052 --> 01:05:59.056
Yeah, I've seen her, baby,
she's involved in some drama,

01:05:59.255 --> 01:06:00.757
but I'm right here.

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:03.434
No, no, I really need to find her,
do you know where she's at?

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.200
Yeah. I know.

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:07.273
And?

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:09.443
And I know I need a cheeseburger.

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:12.103
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:06:14.603 --> 01:06:16.048
Here, this is your cheeseburger.

01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:20.549
And some French fries.

01:06:22.611 --> 01:06:23.715
Where is she?

01:06:28.351 --> 01:06:29.762
Give me that money back.

01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:31.588
Here, I'm gonna give you this.
Where is she?

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:33.324
She's at Donut Time.

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:36.966
- Big spender.
- Go fuck yourself.

01:06:39.428 --> 01:06:40.964
At the Long Beach Barbeque Festival,

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:42.836
you said I was the only girl
you ever truly loved.

01:06:43.032 --> 01:06:44.010
That's true.

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:49.406
You know, people who love people,
don't go fucking other people, Chester.

01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:51.642
Shit, I did not motherfucking
cheat on you.

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:54.117
I'm a businessman, alright?
I move product.

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:57.257
That's what I do. Alright, sometimes
I gotta test the merch is all.

01:06:57.446 --> 01:06:59.153
- How many times did he fuck you?
- Don't answer that.

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:01.760
- How many times?
- He fucked me plenty, okay?

01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:03.828
- How many?
- What is fucking wrong with you?

01:07:04.153 --> 01:07:07.930
Ten? Like, I never had a pimp
who didn't fuck me.

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:10.434
So you had to check
your merchandise ten times, Chester?

01:07:10.659 --> 01:07:13.139
Alright, listen.
Not another word from you.

01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:14.364
You shut your fucking mouth.

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:23.381
Twenty eight days and you mean to tell me
nobody was taking care of you? Nobody?

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:24.710
- Nobody.
- Nobody?

01:07:24.907 --> 01:07:25.885
Nope.

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:29.914
Auntie, are you sure you want
to keep looking?

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:31.756
What was your name again?

01:07:31.947 --> 01:07:33.187
Karo.

01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:40.561
Karo, please don't waste my time.
Take me to Razmik.

01:07:40.856 --> 01:07:44.827
Chester, I was at Twin Towers,
not fucking Wasco State Prison.

01:07:46.028 --> 01:07:47.905
You really do have a crush, don't you?

01:07:48.097 --> 01:07:49.075
Hi, Rizuku!

01:07:49.198 --> 01:07:52.645
Okay, I will take you to your son-in-law.
But do you know why?

01:07:53.135 --> 01:07:55.115
Because he has to understand that
even if he does not respect himself...

01:07:55.304 --> 01:07:58.046
...he must respect his family.

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:01.052
Shit floats to the surface.

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:05.552
Sit your ass fucking down. No, no, man.

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:07.386
She ain't fucking available.

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:09.324
She with me right now.
She ain't fucking working.

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:10.895
We'll be real quick, just 15 minutes.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.031
Yeah, puppy. Just 15 minutes.

01:08:14.857 --> 01:08:15.927
Who are you?

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:18.935
Nigga, who the fuck are you?
I'm her motherfucking fiancé.

01:08:19.127 --> 01:08:20.162
Bounce, motherfucker!

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:22.706
You retired? I didn't know you retired.

01:08:23.064 --> 01:08:24.874
- Yes, she fucking retired.
- Why didn't you tell me you retired?

01:08:25.067 --> 01:08:26.944
Maybe I am available.
Maybe it'll be a freebie.

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:29.376
- My cheating fiancé shouldn't mind.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:08:29.604 --> 01:08:33.051
Have you ever been to Santa Monica
and Highland?

01:08:33.274 --> 01:08:35.118
Oh, I don't remember.

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:36.816
You will remember.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:39.923
Yo, yo, yo, listen. I got a query.
You married, right?

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:42.856
Nigga, you got a fucking wife.
I know you do.

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:44.287
Yeah.

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:47.058
Yeah. So, when you be
fucking my bitches,

01:08:47.288 --> 01:08:49.029
you don't consider it cheating, do you?

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:51.529
I'm paying for it.
It's not like we're getting married.

01:08:51.727 --> 01:08:53.569
Oh, you see?
That's the shit right there.

01:08:53.761 --> 01:08:56.868
- That's what I'm talking about.
- You didn't pay for it, Chester!

01:08:57.566 --> 01:09:01.274
He's lucky he's in America.
Imagine if he was in Armenia.

01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:05.073
Are you available?

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:06.947
I don't think she gots
what you want, Ra-Ra.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:08.587
Nigga, come here. Let me talk to you.

01:09:08.777 --> 01:09:10.381
There's his cab. Should I stop here?

01:09:10.578 --> 01:09:12.115
Stop. Stop. Stop.

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:13.816
Stop right here.

01:09:14.015 --> 01:09:15.184
Cause I'm feeling fucking generous,

01:09:15.283 --> 01:09:16.591
I have motherfucking holiday spirit

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.662
alright, nigga,
I'm gonna get you Pinkberry.

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:21.629
You ever hear of Pinkberry?
Oh, man, trust me.

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:26.167
You know what? It's okay.

01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:27.738
I don't need money.

01:09:28.029 --> 01:09:29.975
Merry motherfucking Christmas,
you know what I'm saying?

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.402
Merry Christmas.

01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:33.136
Happy New Year.

01:09:39.808 --> 01:09:40.843
Razmik!

01:09:41.042 --> 01:09:42.350
That is a cute-ass blouse.

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:44.854
What are you doing here?

01:09:45.046 --> 01:09:46.685
What are you doing here?

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:49.058
- I don't understand.
- You said you were going to work.

01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:51.197
I am at work. I'm getting coffee.

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:52.796
Girl, she shopped
at the same store you shopped at!

01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:55.262
Did Yeva bring you here? Is she here?

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:56.559
No, Yeva did not. Karo brought me here.

01:09:56.759 --> 01:09:57.794
But she wore it better, bitch!

01:09:58.027 --> 01:10:00.439
Nobody asked you, bitch.

01:10:00.596 --> 01:10:02.735
I'm not going anywhere
until I get an explanation.

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:04.775
Who are these people?

01:10:05.467 --> 01:10:08.676
These are just regular people.
Come on, let's go home.

01:10:08.837 --> 01:10:09.872
I said I'm not going to go anywhere.

01:10:10.072 --> 01:10:11.710
Now you got her talking
to him in Chinese!

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:13.876
This is funny!

01:10:14.076 --> 01:10:16.613
Oh, I see... you are smoking
marijuana with these people.

01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:18.788
Oh, my God, what are you talking about?

01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:20.450
If she's talking about me,
I'll fuck her up.

01:10:20.649 --> 01:10:22.993
She thinks I'm doing drugs.
Can you please tell her I don't do drugs?

01:10:23.185 --> 01:10:25.631
- No, he don't do my drugs.
- You see?

01:10:25.854 --> 01:10:27.697
He just fuck all these bitches.
He fuck my bitches.

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:31.064
- Are you crazy?
- Prostitution?

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.738
No!

01:10:32.928 --> 01:10:34.839
How do you say that shit in Russian?
Oh... prostituke!

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:36.304
You have to stop starting shit.

01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:39.211
Oh, these are prostitutes.
These are prostitutes.

01:10:39.401 --> 01:10:41.074
She called me a nick niggy, girl!

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:43.977
Ashken, let me explain.

01:10:44.807 --> 01:10:46.946
Oh, my God... these are men.

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:50.223
Oh, my God... these are men.

01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:52.414
- Wait till you find out about...
- Will you stop over there!

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:53.786
Oh, dear Lord,
my heart is going to stop.

01:10:54.016 --> 01:10:54.994
Will you stop?

01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:58.097
I'm going to have a heart attack.

01:10:58.354 --> 01:11:00.095
I can't have your wife dying up in here.

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:01.767
Shit, she dying, yo!

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:03.834
You gotta tell her I don't know you.
This is my mother-in-law.

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:06.165
Motherfucker, I don't know you.
I don't know that bitch either!

01:11:06.362 --> 01:11:07.500
Mister Chester!

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:12.178
Hold on! She calling the police!

01:11:13.168 --> 01:11:15.506
Yeva, come to the corner of Santa Monica
and Highland. Donut shop.

01:11:15.738 --> 01:11:17.513
She's calling the police!
Your name is Tyrone and I'm Billy!

01:11:17.706 --> 01:11:19.049
They ain't never gonna find us!

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:26.016
Your husband is with gay prostitutes.

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:28.860
Corner of Santa Monica and Highland.

01:11:29.051 --> 01:11:30.860
Tell that bitch do not call the cops!

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:33.500
Done! Done!

01:11:34.056 --> 01:11:35.296
See what you did?

01:11:50.572 --> 01:11:55.043
Oh, shit. Who's shit is this?
This isn't mine, this is good.

01:11:55.611 --> 01:11:58.785
Ashken, listen to me. Let's go home.

01:11:58.981 --> 01:11:59.959
Don't touch me.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:02.026
What do you mean "don't touch me"?
Why did you come here?

01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:03.924
Hey, there is no fighting in here.

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:06.532
- C'mon, get up.
- Don't touch me.

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:08.257
He hurting you?
I can call the police if he...

01:12:08.457 --> 01:12:09.800
No, no, no. I'm not hurting her.

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:12.097
This is my mother-in-law.
She's just a little bit crazy.

01:12:12.294 --> 01:12:13.295
No cops, please.

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:15.475
- Did you hear what she said?
- Razmik!

01:12:16.965 --> 01:12:18.945
"Oh, how was the performance,
Alexandra?"

01:12:19.635 --> 01:12:21.808
"Oh, it was great. Thanks for asking."

01:12:31.046 --> 01:12:34.152
You think the government doesn't know
about aliens and spaceships and shit?

01:12:34.516 --> 01:12:36.860
You think they not keeping it
a secret from us?

01:12:37.219 --> 01:12:40.428
- Exactly. That's cool.
- That's right. I'm with this bitch.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:43.500
- I know you're with that bitch.
- Not like that.

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:45.505
You are embarrassing me.

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:47.366
No, you are embarrassing us.

01:12:47.563 --> 01:12:48.371
C'mon, get up.

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:51.443
What do you want from us?
Don't you feel sorry for my daughter?

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:53.647
So did Mr. Falafel have a big dick?

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:56.516
What? Spit it out.

01:12:57.172 --> 01:12:58.378
I didn't. I swallowed it.

01:12:58.574 --> 01:13:01.384
I know... I...
I fucking set that one up, didn't I?

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:02.714
She's going to call the police.

01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:06.859
In front of all these people,
I'm going to rip your mask off.

01:13:07.082 --> 01:13:08.686
Listen to me. Get up. Let's go.

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:10.124
I'm going to find out
what you are doing here.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.061
Razmik?

01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:24.308
Are you people totally insane?
Why did you bring the baby here?

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.879
Mom, what's going on here?

01:13:28.103 --> 01:13:30.208
Your husband is a dog. Dog.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:31.783
Mom, what's going on with you?

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:35.922
You think I don't know?
I check your bank statements...

01:13:36.145 --> 01:13:37.988
Every night he withdraws cash
from your account...

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:39.454
What does he spend it on? Them.

01:13:39.648 --> 01:13:41.924
This is embarrassing. Please.
Let's go home.

01:13:42.184 --> 01:13:43.754
Mom, why are you getting involved
in my family's affairs?

01:13:43.952 --> 01:13:45.295
It's none of your business.

01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:49.292
You can pretend to be blind
but I cannot.

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:51.127
Get up. We're going home.

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.169
I'm not going to allow him
to get away with this.

01:13:53.695 --> 01:13:55.504
- You see that? You see that?
- Sin-Dee, leave them alone.

01:13:55.697 --> 01:13:56.732
Help me out, sister...

01:13:58.133 --> 01:14:01.114
When your husband goes out
and buys a girl like me,

01:14:01.303 --> 01:14:02.839
do you consider that cheating?

01:14:03.038 --> 01:14:04.381
Sin-Dee, can you please
not talk to my wife.

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:05.880
- Sin-Dee, please...
- Get your hands off her.

01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:08.679
You even know their names? Oh, my God.

01:14:08.877 --> 01:14:10.117
- No, let's go.
- Of course he knows my name!

01:14:10.312 --> 01:14:12.553
<i>Say my name, say my name</i>

01:14:13.048 --> 01:14:14.857
Yo, you're the bitch they threw out!

01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:16.859
Shut your ass up, girl!

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:19.323
What is the prostitute saying to you?

01:14:23.926 --> 01:14:26.463
These are the type of hoes you like?
Dumbass hoes like this?

01:14:26.695 --> 01:14:31.001
He comes home every night smelling like
cheap perfume and you don't say anything.

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.510
I know my husband well enough.
Come on, let's go.

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:35.679
You think you know him? You are blind.

01:14:38.173 --> 01:14:39.379
Razmik, why?

01:14:39.575 --> 01:14:43.484
Why what? What? She's been trying
to destroy our family from day one.

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:44.987
No, you are.

01:14:46.448 --> 01:14:47.984
Razmik, just apologize to the bitch.

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:50.992
Don't be a pussy, yo.
Do not apologize for shit, yo!

01:14:51.186 --> 01:14:53.097
Shut up and get out
of our business, okay?

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:55.165
That's right, Ra-Ra.
You should apologize

01:14:55.424 --> 01:14:57.165
for taking her to
a fucked up hairdresser.

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:59.996
Oh, that's catty, bitch.

01:15:00.562 --> 01:15:01.700
What is the prostitute saying to you?

01:15:02.564 --> 01:15:05.374
Razmik supports the family.
He takes care of us.

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:09.141
What are you talking about?
He only takes care of himself.

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:10.578
I'm going home.

01:15:10.772 --> 01:15:13.548
Mom, what do you want to do,
destroy my family?

01:15:13.809 --> 01:15:15.447
I'll see you in ten years, kid!

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:17.418
Oh, my God, I hate men.

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:19.559
I'm going to rip his mask off.

01:15:19.748 --> 01:15:22.058
Sometimes a wife
has to turn a blind eye.

01:15:22.284 --> 01:15:23.524
No! No!

01:15:25.487 --> 01:15:27.194
Get her! Throw a donut at that bitch!

01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:30.427
Have her, mama. Chester!

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:34.836
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
Bitch call me. Yo, your wife is hot.

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:37.977
I just call the cops. You and you
and you all get out! Out!

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:40.305
No, no, no. Mamasan, I'm sorry.

01:15:40.502 --> 01:15:42.004
Get the fuck out, now.

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:54.220
We cool?

01:15:57.719 --> 01:15:59.027
I know what you're trying to do.

01:15:59.821 --> 01:16:01.528
Come on, I ain't trying to do shit.

01:16:02.758 --> 01:16:04.999
Come on, let me get some of that.

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:19.178
You know you really
piss me off sometimes, Chess.

01:16:19.374 --> 01:16:21.479
I know. I know.

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:23.655
But it's good to see you, baby.

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:25.585
Good to see you, too.

01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:30.258
You know, I kinda wish
she didn't tell me.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.397
Wait. You wish who didn't tell you what?

01:16:33.622 --> 01:16:34.600
Duh.

01:16:34.856 --> 01:16:36.164
What do you mean, duh?

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:38.496
- Hold up, hold up, hold up.
- What?

01:16:38.727 --> 01:16:41.173
This bitch is the one that told you
about this shit?

01:16:41.363 --> 01:16:43.536
You the one that caused
all this motherfucking commotion?

01:16:43.732 --> 01:16:45.575
Her motherfucking ass
goes motherfucking crazy

01:16:45.801 --> 01:16:48.213
on one of my hoes
'cause you started this shit?

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:51.043
You get my ass thrown out
of motherfucking Donut Time

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:53.116
where I conduct
my day to day shit, right?

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:55.855
You act so motherfucking high
and mighty about this shit.

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:57.546
Yeah, yeah, I see it.

01:16:57.779 --> 01:16:59.952
No, no, no, no. But here the thing.
Here the thing...

01:17:00.148 --> 01:17:01.218
What didn't she tell you?

01:17:01.416 --> 01:17:03.760
She didn't tell you that me and her
were knocking it three weeks ago.

01:17:03.952 --> 01:17:05.022
- Oh, shit!
- What?

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.460
You didn't wanna fucking tell her
that part.

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:09.399
You saved her that shit.
You didn't tell her.

01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:10.899
- Oh, shit.
- Sin-Dee...

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:12.629
Sin-Dee fucking what?

01:17:12.894 --> 01:17:14.032
Can you motherfucking believe this shit?

01:17:14.262 --> 01:17:15.366
What is he talking about?

01:17:15.597 --> 01:17:17.975
I fucked your best friend.
Yeah, that's right.

01:17:18.233 --> 01:17:19.940
Oh, you fucking didn't tell her?

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:22.046
Oh, that's interesting
you fucking tell her about this shit

01:17:22.237 --> 01:17:23.238
but not about me and you.

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:26.282
No, no, no. That's right. No, no.
Don't get it twisted.

01:17:26.508 --> 01:17:27.782
Don't get it twisted, girl.

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:29.649
This bitch don't give no fuck about you.

01:17:29.845 --> 01:17:31.085
She don't give no fuck about you.

01:17:31.346 --> 01:17:34.657
Don't get it twisted. She jealous.
She jealous of my hoes.

01:17:35.183 --> 01:17:37.163
You know what I think?
I think she jealous of us.

01:17:37.853 --> 01:17:39.924
You didn't tell her that shit, did you?

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:42.563
I see what's motherfucking
going on here...

01:17:42.791 --> 01:17:44.998
I see what is fucking going on here...

01:17:46.094 --> 01:17:49.906
This motherfucking girl thing.
This is between y'all asses.

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:53.636
This between you two. Right? Right?
So I'm motherfucking out.

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:56.850
This is some girl shit.
You guys work this motherfucker out.

01:17:57.039 --> 01:17:59.645
Let me know when you get it fixed up.
Let me know.

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:03.315
Yo, the shit she did to me was just
a warm up for your ass, bitch.

01:18:19.995 --> 01:18:21.201
You two deserve each other.

01:18:27.035 --> 01:18:28.673
- What the fuck are you laughing at?
- What?

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:30.679
- She about to get her ass beat.
- Shut your stupid ass up.

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:32.180
Shut your dumb ass up.

01:18:33.241 --> 01:18:34.481
Sin-Dee.

01:18:40.415 --> 01:18:41.723
Sin-Dee, talk to me.

01:18:47.856 --> 01:18:49.961
Look, I didn't mean
to hurt you, sweetheart.

01:18:51.593 --> 01:18:53.197
You know you're my best friend.

01:18:53.428 --> 01:18:56.341
You know I love you.
I'd never do anything to hurt you.

01:19:00.035 --> 01:19:01.241
Say something.

01:19:02.704 --> 01:19:04.240
Can I at least take a cab home?

01:19:06.608 --> 01:19:09.748
Oh, shit. Like that Armenian dude
just left, so...

01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:12.252
I mean, I guess
you're like shit out of luck.

01:19:14.641 --> 01:19:16.551
Get down.

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:19.791
No wonder she's crying
having a father like that.

01:19:20.021 --> 01:19:21.056
Mother, please.

01:19:40.041 --> 01:19:41.247
Sin-Dee...

01:20:24.186 --> 01:20:27.565
Sin-Dee, will you just talk to me?
Come on.

01:20:46.341 --> 01:20:47.513
Y'all got a...

01:20:56.384 --> 01:20:58.227
Look...

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:02.634
It was only once.
It didn't mean a thing.

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:33.225
Hey.

01:21:37.225 --> 01:21:42.538
Yeah... I have a full house.
I called in another girl.

01:21:43.431 --> 01:21:47.470
So... just hang, okay?

01:22:40.588 --> 01:22:44.229
Please, Sin-Dee. I'm sorry.

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:48.073
Great, now get the fuck out of here
and leave me alone.

01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:04.089
Now let me make my money
and go the fuck home.

01:23:17.258 --> 01:23:19.669
Hi, are we looking for a party...

01:23:20.428 --> 01:23:22.999
- Oh, my God.
- Merry Christmas, you tranny faggot.

01:23:26.101 --> 01:23:28.081
We pissed on your friend, bitch!

01:23:33.475 --> 01:23:35.284
Oh, my God.
They just threw fucking piss on me.

01:23:37.078 --> 01:23:38.387
It's in my mouth.

01:23:38.513 --> 01:23:39.856
- It's in my fucking hair!
- Wait, wait.

01:23:40.048 --> 01:23:41.618
I don't have no fucking money
for new hair.

01:23:48.723 --> 01:23:51.363
Oh, my God, come on, come on.
Take this off.

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:55.132
Oh, my God.

01:23:57.732 --> 01:24:00.008
You know what, why don't
I just take these off too, huh?

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:07.115
This has to come off too.

01:24:09.244 --> 01:24:10.382
Okay.

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:44.581
Girl... here.

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:00.031
Oh, girl.

01:25:00.261 --> 01:25:01.740
Pull that down.

01:25:03.698 --> 01:25:05.905
We'll just be bald together.

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:10.777
That actually looks good on you.

01:25:14.042 --> 01:25:15.248
Now, as for me...
