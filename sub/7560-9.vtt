00:10.209 --> 00:13.839
<i>Mealtime in the Croodaceous period
had always been the same.</i>

00:15.047 --> 00:16.591
<i>Scary.</i>

00:16.675 --> 00:19.093
<i>But it got easier when people
started living together.</i>

00:19.177 --> 00:21.304
<i>Kind of.</i>

00:21.387 --> 00:25.642
<i>With new people came new ideas
about what we should eat and how.</i>

00:25.725 --> 00:30.772
<i>And that served up the scariest
side dish of all... change.</i>

00:30.897 --> 00:35.485
And that's why you never
eat green meat. The end.

00:37.236 --> 00:41.449
Ah, controversial stance, Eep.

00:45.035 --> 00:47.914
Now, everyone,
take out your homework.

00:47.998 --> 00:51.167
One mosquitoad.

00:53.003 --> 00:56.381
Uh, teacher, a liyote
ate my homework.

00:56.464 --> 00:58.675
And my arm.

00:58.758 --> 01:02.512
Incomplete.
Again.

01:02.595 --> 01:07.433
Let's begin.
First, we pet the mosquitoad.

01:07.517 --> 01:10.770
We coo to it.
Coo! Coo!

01:10.896 --> 01:13.439
<i>It learns to care for us.</i>

01:13.523 --> 01:14.900
And then we gut it!

01:14.983 --> 01:16.818
Oh, and Bulk, you're excused.

01:16.943 --> 01:19.779
Ooh! Bulk doesn't get
to kill the prey!

01:19.905 --> 01:23.766
- He's in trouble!
- No, no, Bulk doesn't eat animals.

01:23.767 --> 01:25.368
He's different that way.

01:25.451 --> 01:29.288
Huh? Hm.

01:34.293 --> 01:37.923
- Ouch!
- So you only drink animals?

01:38.006 --> 01:41.051
No animals, at all.
I'm a veg-a-eatian

01:41.133 --> 01:43.177
because I'm different
from the rest of you.

01:43.261 --> 01:45.304
Meaning I'm better
than the rest of you.

01:45.388 --> 01:48.600
Whoa, I don't understand
why you don't eat animals.

01:48.683 --> 01:51.352
- They eat us all the time!
- That hurts!

01:51.436 --> 01:52.938
Teacher's getting eaten right now.

01:53.021 --> 01:55.231
Ooh! Ow!
New assignment, class.

01:55.314 --> 01:58.234
Save your teacher's life.
That hurts! Ooh!

01:58.317 --> 02:00.319
Pfft. You don't get it.

02:00.403 --> 02:03.155
You only eat meat because
people tell you to.

02:03.239 --> 02:05.324
You're a follower.

02:05.408 --> 02:07.786
- I'm not a follower!
- Oh, yeah?

02:07.869 --> 02:10.026
Then why are you
following me right now?

02:10.104 --> 02:12.624
Boom.

02:14.998 --> 02:17.912
<b>1x09 - "Garden of Eaten"</b>

02:25.884 --> 02:28.219
Eep! Dad, brought home
a surprise!

02:28.303 --> 02:30.806
I hope it's a gir-elephant
that's been made mini

02:30.889 --> 02:32.599
so you can fit it in your hand!

02:32.682 --> 02:36.770
- Thunk, I told you it's not that.
- Okay, sure, Dad.

02:36.853 --> 02:41.608
No, it's my famous meatball!

02:41.733 --> 02:43.252
<i>Meatball!</i>

02:43.276 --> 02:44.945
It's my secret recipe.

02:45.027 --> 02:48.573
The secret is I mash all
the meat into a ball shape.

02:55.121 --> 02:56.748
What's the matter, Eep?

02:56.832 --> 02:59.584
You love when your father
makes the meat round.

02:59.709 --> 03:01.085
Is it not round enough?

03:01.169 --> 03:03.003
No, it's just...

03:03.087 --> 03:06.299
Have you guys ever thought
about why we eat meat?

03:09.427 --> 03:11.847
Honey, you're talking hungry talk.
Eat your meat.

03:11.930 --> 03:18.060
- You know, Bulk is a veg-a-eatian.
- He eats people?

03:20.104 --> 03:23.900
- No, Thunk, he only eats plants.
- You can eat plants?

03:27.362 --> 03:29.322
Of course it's Snoot's kid.

03:29.405 --> 03:31.073
That family can't even eat normal.

03:31.157 --> 03:34.035
Wait, you guys know
about veg-a-eatians?

03:34.118 --> 03:35.370
Bulk didn't invent it?

03:35.453 --> 03:38.498
Pfft, the first veg-a-eatian
lived years ago

03:38.581 --> 03:41.835
and tasted delicious.

03:44.546 --> 03:48.257
Uh, or so I hear.

03:48.341 --> 03:51.344
Yes, and just because
you can eat plants

03:51.427 --> 03:52.804
doesn't mean you should.

03:52.888 --> 03:56.098
I mean, I can eat rocks,
but I shouldn't because...

03:56.182 --> 03:58.643
You'll poop pebbles.
Been there.

03:59.644 --> 04:01.897
No, because it's weird.

04:01.980 --> 04:04.566
Kids today don't understand
our traditions.

04:04.649 --> 04:06.359
Like eating meat, bathing in dirt,

04:06.442 --> 04:08.444
or singing a song
to the moon every night

04:08.528 --> 04:10.488
so it doesn't fall on our heads
and crush us.

04:10.572 --> 04:14.701
So your only reason for eating meat
is everyone else eats meat?

04:14.826 --> 04:18.538
- Exactly! See? You get it.
- Listen, I'm not a follower.

04:18.620 --> 04:20.916
I wanna try just eating vegetables.

04:20.999 --> 04:23.543
Vegetables... vegetables...
 vegetables...

04:27.505 --> 04:31.927
There is no way we're gonna try that
in my cave, young lady.

04:33.219 --> 04:36.138
Oh, yeah?
Okay, then I won't try.

04:36.222 --> 04:40.602
From now on, I am a full-on
veg-a-eatian!

04:43.521 --> 04:47.984
Let's cool it!
Croods, corners!

04:51.112 --> 04:53.448
Fine, but my corner is meat-free!

04:53.531 --> 04:57.452
My corner has spider-ants!

04:57.535 --> 04:58.912
Cool!

04:58.995 --> 05:02.331
Why is she being crazy?
Eep used to love meatball night.

05:02.415 --> 05:06.586
She's just at that age where
she starts questioning everything.

05:06.669 --> 05:10.339
I was the same way.
We just need to support her interests

05:10.423 --> 05:13.551
<i>until she realizes how terrible
they are on her own.</i>

05:13.635 --> 05:15.762
You know, like good parents.

05:15.887 --> 05:20.224
So, Croods, we're eating
vegetables for dinner!

05:20.308 --> 05:22.978
Yeah!

05:23.061 --> 05:26.188
So you're saying Thunk's also
gonna be this difficult some day?

05:26.272 --> 05:29.525
Oh, you're tickling me!

05:30.693 --> 05:31.611
No.

05:32.487 --> 05:34.906
Ooh, don't these leaves look yummy?

05:34.990 --> 05:37.492
See? Gathering is easy!

05:37.575 --> 05:39.995
Yes, and that's
what's wrong with it.

05:40.078 --> 05:41.913
You can't trust easy.

05:41.997 --> 05:43.581
But hunting? Hunting is hard.

05:43.665 --> 05:47.043
Hunting can kill you,
that's how you know it's good.

05:47.127 --> 05:48.478
And, hey, anyone else realize

05:48.479 --> 05:50.505
that now we're all just following Eep?

05:50.588 --> 05:53.508
Have I made my point
that we're all followers?

05:53.591 --> 05:58.638
No one's following!
We are all our own leaders.

06:00.222 --> 06:01.808
Sandy, no!

06:01.933 --> 06:05.269
I mean, lead
yourself away from that meat.

06:10.942 --> 06:13.402
Get me one of those
big leaves, Thunk.

06:13.486 --> 06:15.113
Actually, make it two.

06:15.195 --> 06:20.952
- Why aren't you up here, Gran?
- Oh, I told you, I'm too old and weak.

06:25.289 --> 06:29.961
- Who wants dinner?
- Oh, wow, yummy.

06:30.045 --> 06:33.965
I don't know if I can eat all of this.

06:34.049 --> 06:35.383
I can.

06:41.056 --> 06:43.307
Hey, I thought you said
you were weak.

06:43.391 --> 06:45.518
- Just an excuse.
- A what?

06:45.601 --> 06:47.395
I made it up so I wouldn't have to do

06:47.396 --> 06:51.191
- something I didn't want to do.
- Oh...

06:53.943 --> 06:57.780
Hey, Mom, I need to eat
the meatball right now

06:57.864 --> 07:00.491
because my head
will blow up if I don't.

07:00.575 --> 07:02.952
- Like that?
- Needs work.

07:03.036 --> 07:06.081
So that's it?
How does that Bulky kid do it?

07:06.164 --> 07:09.000
Maybe Bulk's mom feeds him
meat when he's sleeping.

07:09.084 --> 07:11.878
That's how I stopped Sandy
from sleep-biting Thunk.

07:12.003 --> 07:16.091
I know where there's plenty of food
just begging to be eaten.

07:18.426 --> 07:21.387
 Huh?
I'm alive!

07:24.557 --> 07:29.062
There's plenty of veggies
around here somewhere.

07:29.145 --> 07:32.190
Looking for veggies, huh?

07:32.273 --> 07:34.025
That bush is talking!

07:34.109 --> 07:35.610
I'm hungry, let's eat it.

07:35.693 --> 07:38.654
- I'm not a bush.
- Don't listen to the bush, Thunk.

07:38.738 --> 07:40.531
Help me take off its arms!

07:40.615 --> 07:46.746
- Nah, this body is all veg-a-eatian.
- Point, meat-eaters.

07:46.829 --> 07:49.749
Welcome to the veggie club, friend.

07:49.832 --> 07:53.128
Whoa, now that will fill you up!

07:53.211 --> 07:57.590
- Where do I find veggies this big?
- The Garden of Eaten.

07:57.673 --> 07:59.259
Everyone calls it that.

08:01.552 --> 08:04.951
Okay, I call it that.
Anywho, get all these

08:04.952 --> 08:08.350
and you'll be set to
feed your whole family.

08:08.434 --> 08:11.271
- For days?
- For dinner. One dinner.

08:11.353 --> 08:13.815
Oh... Well, still works.

08:13.898 --> 08:16.109
- Let's go!
- Uh, no.

08:16.192 --> 08:19.361
We're going home.
New places are too dangerous.

08:19.445 --> 08:21.572
You always say that.

08:21.656 --> 08:23.783
Because it's good advice to follow.

08:23.866 --> 08:24.951
Nobody ever said,

08:25.076 --> 08:27.912
"Oh, he died when he walked
into that old familiar place."

08:28.037 --> 08:30.165
I'm not a follower anymore, Dad.

08:30.248 --> 08:35.376
- You can stay here, but I'm going.
- No, none of us are going.

08:35.461 --> 08:39.090
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

08:39.174 --> 08:42.717
To be clear, I am only here
to make sure nobody dies.

08:42.802 --> 08:45.513
Except for Gran.
Gran, you're on your own.

08:45.596 --> 08:47.182
Deal.

08:47.265 --> 08:49.684
This old bird likes to fly solo.

08:50.310 --> 08:52.603
Psh, this is gonna be great!

08:52.687 --> 08:55.731
Okay, once I grab
all of the stuff on this list,

08:55.815 --> 09:00.069
we'll have so much good food,
you won't even want meat anymore.

09:00.736 --> 09:02.197
Look! Easy pickin's!

09:07.451 --> 09:09.411
Come here, berry.

09:09.495 --> 09:12.040
Who's the cutest little berry?

09:12.123 --> 09:13.208
Come here.

09:13.291 --> 09:15.877
Ta-da!
One down.

09:17.503 --> 09:21.257
Oh, yeah,
that tree wart looks tasty.

09:21.341 --> 09:25.469
- But is it tastier than this?
- No, Grug,

09:25.553 --> 09:29.140
we're supporting Eep
by not eating that meatball.

09:29.515 --> 09:34.020
That delicious, perfect ball of meat.

09:38.774 --> 09:42.653
You really want to be
mindless followers for this?

09:43.654 --> 09:45.573
Tell you what, the sooner you help me

09:45.656 --> 09:48.201
find everything on my list,
the sooner you can eat this.

09:48.284 --> 09:50.619
But trust me, once you taste my veggies,

09:50.703 --> 09:54.707
you won't even want to eat meat.
Deal?

09:54.790 --> 09:58.878
Then let's get gathering!
Whoo!

09:59.754 --> 10:02.715
Mom, I don't think I can gather.

10:02.798 --> 10:05.593
My head will explode if I do.

10:06.344 --> 10:10.306
- You already used that excuse.
- Right! Uh...

10:10.390 --> 10:12.183
My eyes will explode.

10:12.267 --> 10:16.187
I love it,
but maybe less explosions.

10:16.271 --> 10:18.564
Oh...

10:19.565 --> 10:21.442
When is she going to get over this?

10:21.525 --> 10:24.779
Croods follow traditions
like eating meat and hunting

10:24.862 --> 10:26.822
and, like, how we all
bury the hair we shed

10:26.906 --> 10:29.951
- so we'll never lose it.
- You bury your hair?

10:30.034 --> 10:33.913
Let's not get side-tracked, Ugga.

10:34.663 --> 10:37.666
Dumb, stupid, plants.

10:39.000 --> 10:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:32.138 --> 11:35.016
Bugs aren't meat, are they?

11:48.696 --> 11:52.532
Oh, sorry, little plant.
I didn't mean to startle you.

11:52.616 --> 11:55.682
I just meant
to tear you out of the ground

11:55.683 --> 11:57.079
so my family can eat you!

12:00.082 --> 12:02.293
Ha! Way to distract it, Thunk!

12:02.377 --> 12:05.754
<i>You're welcome!</i>

12:07.173 --> 12:09.884
Thunk! Where are you?

12:09.967 --> 12:13.095
Once we find your brother, we
are going home for a real dinner.

12:13.179 --> 12:15.306
That's so unfair.
Just because you want

12:15.307 --> 12:17.433
to go home doesn't mean
everybody does.

12:17.517 --> 12:19.268
Right, everybody?

12:24.106 --> 12:25.358
Just me, huh?

12:25.441 --> 12:28.403
But I only have
half the veggies on my list.

12:28.486 --> 12:31.655
Sweetie, we wanted to support you
in trying something different...

12:31.739 --> 12:33.505
<i>And it has been trying,</i>

12:33.525 --> 12:37.203
really trying, because
different is always terrible.

12:37.286 --> 12:39.121
So come on, let's go.

12:41.832 --> 12:44.502
<i>Guys! Look what I found!</i>

12:47.296 --> 12:51.092
You found the heart of the garden!

12:51.175 --> 12:53.386
Everything else on my list is here.

12:55.221 --> 12:56.638
Are you okay, Thunk?

12:56.722 --> 12:59.350
Sure, Mom.
I made a soft landing.

12:59.434 --> 13:00.893
Except for this.

13:03.062 --> 13:06.566
Yay, you found
your so-called "food."

13:06.648 --> 13:10.194
Just try it!
For me?

13:16.576 --> 13:20.037
Doesn't stink too bad.

13:22.706 --> 13:25.543
Hey, that tastes pretty good.

13:29.422 --> 13:31.591
Fleshy, it's crunchy.

13:31.673 --> 13:34.885
It's almost like... food!

13:34.969 --> 13:36.845
Look at me!

13:36.929 --> 13:39.098
I'm a veggie-eaty man!

13:44.061 --> 13:47.315
Uh, Dad's fruit isn't on your list.

13:47.398 --> 13:49.400
Oh, wait.
Yes it is. There.

13:53.446 --> 13:55.906
Grug? Honey?

13:55.990 --> 13:59.410
- How do you feel?
- Amazing! Full!

13:59.494 --> 14:02.955
<i>Different...</i>

14:07.168 --> 14:09.170
So, Dad's acting weird.

14:09.253 --> 14:14.592
- Definitely not okay.
- Leaf monster!

14:14.674 --> 14:17.094
Don't worry. I have a plan.

14:22.433 --> 14:24.810
Mom, how does this plan help Grug?

14:24.893 --> 14:28.648
Oh, my plan was
to get away from Grug.

14:31.702 --> 14:36.531
Uh, Dad?
Are you all right?

14:37.239 --> 14:38.449
Snake hair!

14:38.533 --> 14:40.242
<i>Monster, vulture-face!</i>

14:40.326 --> 14:42.744
Man in tree!

14:42.828 --> 14:46.123
Grug, you're seeing things
that aren't real.

14:46.207 --> 14:48.626
Actually, I am in a tree.

14:48.709 --> 14:51.170
Why didn't you tell us
that the plants in this garden

14:51.253 --> 14:53.464
are just as dangerous
as the predators?

14:53.548 --> 14:58.260
- They ain't dangerous.
- There's a flower eating your foot.

14:58.344 --> 15:01.222
Not eating, pollinating.

15:01.305 --> 15:04.600
Spit it out, plant man!
What is wrong with my dad?

15:04.684 --> 15:07.811
Well, looks like he ate
a happy fruit.

15:07.895 --> 15:09.730
A happy fruit?

15:09.813 --> 15:12.149
It makes everything you see
appear terrifying.

15:13.817 --> 15:17.821
- Is there any cure?
- Oh, it'll pass in a week or two.

15:17.905 --> 15:21.409
Until it does, get him comfortable
and let him stare at the moon.

15:21.492 --> 15:24.370
Lean into it, brother.
Enjoy the ride.

15:24.453 --> 15:26.830
<i>Hey!</i>

15:30.876 --> 15:33.629
Any faster way to wrap this up?

15:36.507 --> 15:37.883
Hitting seems to work.

15:37.966 --> 15:41.387
Well, a grandberry
would pull him right out of it.

15:41.470 --> 15:42.846
It's on your list.

15:44.599 --> 15:47.059
Great! Which tree has it?

15:51.355 --> 15:54.024
Okay, we're clearly not doing that.

15:54.108 --> 15:57.528
Honey, you're gonna
have to ride it out at home.

15:57.612 --> 16:01.657
I'm flying, but the sky is melting!

16:01.741 --> 16:04.243
No, Mom, let's go grab
the grandberry.

16:04.326 --> 16:06.704
- It's faster and...
- Green apple lightning bolt!

16:06.787 --> 16:10.999
- ...has less of that.
- No, Eep. I tried to be supportive,

16:11.083 --> 16:13.127
but I am not gonna
send the family into danger

16:13.210 --> 16:15.170
for this phase of yours anymore.

16:15.254 --> 16:18.298
Your father's seeing
things, Thunk's got a fruit

16:18.299 --> 16:21.343
stuck to his butt, and the
rest of us are starving.

16:21.427 --> 16:24.805
A phase?
This is who I am now!

16:24.888 --> 16:27.725
Oh! Can I play tug-a-dad too?

16:27.808 --> 16:31.895
Monsters, please,
stop tearing me apart!

16:32.854 --> 16:34.856
No, we're going home.
Follow me.

16:34.940 --> 16:38.068
I am not a follower.

16:41.322 --> 16:43.949
Was I ever this stubborn?

16:44.032 --> 16:45.618
Uh, yeah.

16:45.701 --> 16:49.580
I'm still waiting for you
to take my advice and dump Grug.

16:49.664 --> 16:52.958
Hey, wait!
Anyone up for a drum circle?

17:01.717 --> 17:03.844
Anyone else taste color?!

17:04.595 --> 17:09.266
- Shh, the tree is sleeping!
- Oh, sorry, tree.

17:09.349 --> 17:11.685
Glad that sounds normal to him.

17:19.652 --> 17:22.696
And my dad said
gathering was too easy.

17:31.789 --> 17:34.249
Giant, cute death beast!

17:34.333 --> 17:38.003
Shh, Dad, no!
Be quietly crazy.

18:04.946 --> 18:07.908
I wanted to be a veg-a-eatian,

18:07.991 --> 18:11.912
but now, we're about
to be veg-a-eaten!

18:12.913 --> 18:15.624
Eep!

18:16.751 --> 18:20.295
If we're going to be eaten,
let's eat this first.

18:20.379 --> 18:24.216
I didn't want to be a follower,
but your meatball is the best!

18:24.299 --> 18:26.051
You want to split it?

18:26.134 --> 18:28.596
You have a meat head!

18:28.679 --> 18:30.138
I'll take that as a "yes."

18:33.475 --> 18:38.480
Huh? Killer grandberry
tree wants a meatball?

18:38.564 --> 18:40.775
Then fetch!

18:50.492 --> 18:51.827
Huh?

18:53.036 --> 18:56.373
Uh, the world stopped melting.

19:00.878 --> 19:03.756
Croods, we got an Eep to gather.

19:37.456 --> 19:39.500
Not sure how much of this
is really happening,

19:39.583 --> 19:41.335
but, uh, let's do it!

19:48.258 --> 19:51.178
Hiyah!

20:12.366 --> 20:16.077
Do it!
I am real hungry for bark.

20:20.332 --> 20:24.837
So, who wants dinner?

20:25.671 --> 20:27.673
I could eat!

20:33.053 --> 20:35.347
Pfft, followers.

20:35.430 --> 20:39.267
How? We nearly killed
ourselves hunting vegetables.

20:39.351 --> 20:41.436
Who else does that?

20:41.520 --> 20:44.272
Pfft, yeah, everyone's
a veg-a-eatian now.

20:44.356 --> 20:47.399
That's why I only eat air.

20:48.610 --> 20:50.738
Oh, that's new to you?

20:50.821 --> 20:54.199
Because we've been eating
air for our whole lives.

20:54.282 --> 20:56.577
Hm, guess you're just a follower.

20:56.660 --> 20:59.844
- Boom!
- Oh, yeah?

20:59.879 --> 21:02.708
Well, I won't eat air anymore, either.

21:11.675 --> 21:15.262
You know, maybe being
a follower isn't so bad.

21:15.345 --> 21:18.682
Especially if you're following
your family home to dinner.

21:18.766 --> 21:20.400
But without you leading us,

21:20.401 --> 21:22.853
we never would've found this great food.

21:22.937 --> 21:24.813
You're brave and I'm proud of you

21:24.897 --> 21:28.442
and a little scared,
but mostly proud.

21:30.611 --> 21:31.653
Ah-ah-ah, Thunk.

21:31.737 --> 21:33.822
Get some dirt on your hands
before you eat.

21:33.906 --> 21:37.242
But, Mom, uh, I can't

21:37.325 --> 21:40.495
because my arms hurt
from fighting a monster.

21:40.579 --> 21:42.456
Great excuse!

21:42.539 --> 21:45.333
But listen to your mom.
Even I'm afraid of her.

21:49.671 --> 21:52.299
Hey, Mom,
thanks for supporting me,

21:52.382 --> 21:54.259
even if it was just a phase.

21:54.342 --> 21:56.720
Oh, I'll support all your phases.

21:56.804 --> 21:59.098
Besides, without you
and your veggies,

21:59.180 --> 22:01.058
I'd never have made this...

22:02.726 --> 22:05.562
<i>Double meatball!</i>

22:07.439 --> 22:12.027
Too... much... beauty!

22:16.782 --> 22:20.119
We need to have veggies
more often!

22:20.201 --> 22:25.532
 Uh, no, no.
We are not doing that again. I...

22:27.668 --> 22:29.086
Fine.

22:32.840 --> 22:35.634
<i> And that's the story
of how we became</i>

22:35.717 --> 22:37.719
<i>meat and veg-a-eatians.</i>
