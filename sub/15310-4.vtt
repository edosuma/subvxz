00:01.835 --> 00:05.306
Last night was fantastic.

00:05.339 --> 00:08.642
So was this morning.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.411
It was like
you had four hands.

00:10.444 --> 00:14.748
Like you were everywhere
at the same time.

00:14.782 --> 00:18.486
Like some kind
of sex magician.

00:18.519 --> 00:21.822
I abraca-did-ya.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.891
Well, I had a great time.

00:23.924 --> 00:26.260
Me, too.

00:31.132 --> 00:33.701
So will that be
cash or check?

00:37.938 --> 00:40.541
You slept with a prostitute?!

00:40.574 --> 00:43.277
By accident.

00:43.311 --> 00:48.182
So, your vagina swerved
and crashed into his penis?

00:48.216 --> 00:50.684
It was a simple
miscommunication.

00:50.718 --> 00:54.054
Remember, I told you I had
that blind date last night?

00:57.891 --> 00:59.927
Hi. Are you...
Are you...

01:00.894 --> 01:02.196
Katherine?

01:02.230 --> 01:04.064
It's Kate, actually, but...

01:04.098 --> 01:06.367
you look like Brad Pitt
and smell like firewood,

01:06.400 --> 01:09.170
so you can call me Lisa
for all I care.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.373
It looked like he was
waiting for a blind date.

01:12.406 --> 01:16.710
How was I supposed to know
he was waiting for a client?

01:16.744 --> 01:19.913
Why did you pay him?

01:19.947 --> 01:23.584
I don't shoplift dong.

01:25.953 --> 01:27.921
You want to know the
greatest indignity?

01:27.955 --> 01:31.992
He left his card on my pillow
like it was a hotel mint.

01:32.025 --> 01:33.727
Ooh.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.596
"Handy Randy."
God,

01:35.629 --> 01:37.097
I'm so embarrassed.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.132
I just want to forget this
whole thing ever happened.

01:38.166 --> 01:39.133
We will never,

01:39.167 --> 01:41.135
ever speak of this again.

01:41.169 --> 01:41.969
Understood.

01:42.002 --> 01:43.171
Absolutely.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.906
But first,
can you tell us everything?

01:45.939 --> 01:48.209
All right, bring it in.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.757
Well, guys,
it's official.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.426
My divorce is final.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.927
Congratulations!

02:06.960 --> 02:09.263
To the newly liberated
Dr. Will Stokes.

02:09.297 --> 02:11.632
All the fun
with half the assets.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.768
You know, it's actually
less than half.

02:14.802 --> 02:17.271
I mean, she got the house,
the car, the dog...

02:17.305 --> 02:19.473
Let's call it half.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.642
To half!

02:21.675 --> 02:24.278
Ooh, you guys, look, it's
a Shimmering Essence commercial.

02:24.312 --> 02:25.646
I have an audition
for their new campaign.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.948
Babe, this is your
hair's big break.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.484
And to think,
I was completely bald

02:30.518 --> 02:32.653
for the first 18 months
of my life.

02:32.686 --> 02:36.890
See that? It's like a real
rags to riches story.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.230
What is that?

02:47.235 --> 02:48.802
You've got
a rat, mate.

02:50.070 --> 02:52.306
A bloody
big one, too.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.976
I-I have a thing about rats.

02:56.009 --> 02:59.313
Rodents are the natural
consequence of having children.

02:59.347 --> 03:03.317
Filthy, filthy children.

03:03.351 --> 03:07.388
Making you the godmother
was clearly the right choice.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.927
It's in the walls!
It's under the floor.
I'm leaving.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.329
Oh, no.

03:15.363 --> 03:17.865
I forgot my coat
and it's gotten all cold out.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.267
Borrow mine.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.835
I won't need a jacket
when the rat eats my arms.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.338
Lovely.

03:24.372 --> 03:28.742
Ah, it's got
that delicious Will smell.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.178
All right, that's it.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.781
I'm putting all my
Fruit Roll-Ups in a Ziploc bag.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.051
Guys, please remember, when
you catch our little friend,

03:38.085 --> 03:39.387
be humane, all right?

03:39.420 --> 03:40.854
Release him
into the woods.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.357
Absolutely.
In the woods.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.693
I'm gonna kill that thing.
He's done.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.562
All right, I'll call
an exterminator.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.565
No, no, no, no. Those
guys are total scammers.

03:51.599 --> 03:54.234
Oh, no, Bobby, please don't
start with the scammers.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.236
It's true.
Three guys show up in a van,

03:56.270 --> 03:58.372
one to sell us an overpriced
monthly warranty,

03:58.406 --> 04:00.274
two to case the joint
for a robbery.

04:00.308 --> 04:02.142
No, thanks.
I will buy some traps.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.211
Bing, bang, boom, it's handled.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.280
Like you bing-bang-boomed
the leaky faucet?

04:06.314 --> 04:08.215
Hey, the plumber said what I did
made it-- and I quote--

04:08.248 --> 04:09.850
"no worse."

04:15.356 --> 04:17.891
Guys, good news. Me and my hair

04:17.925 --> 04:20.328
got a callback for the
Shimmering Essence commercial.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.929
All right.
Yep,

04:21.962 --> 04:23.397
all I have to do
is nail one line.

04:23.431 --> 04:24.965
Oh, that's great.
What's the line?
Mmm,

04:24.998 --> 04:26.300
okay, get ready.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.636
"It's in my hair."

04:31.305 --> 04:32.906
What'd you think?

04:32.940 --> 04:34.241
Fine.
Good.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.811
Okay, what'd you really think?

04:37.845 --> 04:39.279
Bad.
Not good.

04:39.313 --> 04:42.282
All right, what was
wrong with it?
Honestly,

04:42.316 --> 04:43.917
it was too casual.
I disagree.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.419
I think
it was too stiff.

04:45.453 --> 04:46.954
I'm with Will.
It's like you had hair,

04:46.987 --> 04:49.089
but you didn't actually care
that you had hair.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.157
No.

04:50.190 --> 04:51.459
It needs some flavor.

04:51.492 --> 04:52.826
What if you do it
with a British accent?

04:52.860 --> 04:55.796
Like, "'Ello, guv'nor,
it's in me 'air."

04:59.199 --> 05:00.601
Hey!

05:00.634 --> 05:01.935
Now you've totally

05:01.969 --> 05:04.505
freaked my hair out.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.274
Do you guys think
it's weird that Lowell's

05:07.307 --> 05:08.976
still wearing my jacket?

05:10.478 --> 05:12.112
Why? You lent it to him.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.514
For a night.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.349
Now it's the next day
and he's still wearing it.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.351
It's outrageous. You go
into a situation thinking

05:17.385 --> 05:18.852
it's one thing and,
the next thing you know,

05:18.886 --> 05:20.120
your wallet is empty

05:20.153 --> 05:21.689
and you can't look
at yourself in the mirror.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.358
Why don't you just ask
for the jacket back?

05:24.392 --> 05:25.793
He shouldn't have
to, all right?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.461
The lendee should return
the item to the lender

05:27.495 --> 05:30.130
without being asked.
It's the social contract.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.299
All right, guys.
Here you go.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.301
Will wants
his jacket back.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.236
What? Bobby,
what are you...

05:36.269 --> 05:38.806
I don't... I... I'm not in...

05:38.839 --> 05:39.973
I don't e...

05:42.009 --> 05:43.977
Oh, I'm sorry, mate. I spent
the night at Jules'. I didn't

05:44.011 --> 05:45.813
have a change of clothes.
Here, let me give it back.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.515
Lowell, Lowell, don't.
Come on. It's cold.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.517
I'm not gonna take the clothes
off your back.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.685
Just return it after work.
Leave it on the porch.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.822
If-if you're in
the neighborhood.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.724
Before 10:00.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.500
Doesn't this thing
ever sleep?

06:06.534 --> 06:09.737
He's, like, training
for a decathlon.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.440
Yes!

06:12.473 --> 06:16.343
I got you, you
son of a bitch!

06:16.376 --> 06:18.612
Huh? Huh?

06:18.646 --> 06:21.048
Okay, okay. You said
that you'd handle it,

06:21.081 --> 06:22.349
and you totally delivered.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.084
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.419
You should be sorry
'cause I just...

06:28.922 --> 06:30.357
Oh, he's not dead.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.426
He's trying to free himself.

06:32.460 --> 06:35.262
Calm down, calm down.
Give it a minute.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.536
It has been
over an hour.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.538
I-I can't stand
to hear him suffer.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.206
Please do something.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.042
It's in its death throes.
It's gonna be over any second.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.614
There. It stopped. See?

06:53.647 --> 06:55.949
I told you once,
I told you a thousand times...

06:57.417 --> 06:58.886
It escaped.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.287
We didn't kill it.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.755
We just pissed it off.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.058
This is why normal people
call an exterminator.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.426
Please. Call one.

07:06.460 --> 07:09.096
Absolutely not.
I can deal with this on my own.

07:09.129 --> 07:11.632
Yeah, key phrase being "on your
own" because I can't stay here.

07:11.665 --> 07:12.833
I'm taking the baby to Kate's.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.135
Unless you want
to use him as bait.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.070
Very funny.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.839
But that rat will be gone by
the time you get home tomorrow.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.007
I promise.

07:21.008 --> 07:24.912
I will be wearing his
pelt as a trophy!

07:36.690 --> 07:40.694
Oh. Thank you so much for
letting us have the big room.

07:40.728 --> 07:45.465
So this is where you did
it with the prostitute.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.536
Really? In front of the kid?

07:48.569 --> 07:50.804
Oh, please. He's
heard much worse.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.442
So, how are you holding up?

07:55.475 --> 07:57.945
I'm full of wine and shame.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.180
So you slept with a hooker
by accident.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.115
I mean, we've all been there.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.452
I mean, not "we" but you.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.288
I just... I can't stop thinking
about it.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.791
Well, what are you gonna do?
You can't un-sleep with him.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.125
No.

08:12.159 --> 08:15.328
But I can un-pay for it.

08:15.362 --> 08:17.330
Right? Think
about it.

08:17.364 --> 08:18.532
The only thing
that makes him a hooker

08:18.566 --> 08:20.233
is the fact that I paid him.

08:20.267 --> 08:21.835
But if I get my money back,

08:21.869 --> 08:25.505
then he's just some hot guy
I slept with on Saturday night.

08:25.539 --> 08:28.208
This has really taken
over your life, hasn't it?

08:28.241 --> 08:30.744
I can't stop showering.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.152
Aha.

08:39.186 --> 08:43.857
I figured this might be
your base of operations.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.325
Kate, right?

08:45.358 --> 08:46.393
Mm-hmm.
- Um, I only

08:46.426 --> 08:47.494
have cash
for one of you.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.497
Does the threesome
cost extra?

08:50.530 --> 08:53.567
You couldn't afford me.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.502
I have to speak to you.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.837
Now's not a...

08:56.870 --> 08:58.672
good time.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.408
I want my money back.

09:01.441 --> 09:02.843
What? No way.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.345
The sex trade
is a no-refund business.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.614
Well, that's just it.
I didn't realize

09:06.647 --> 09:08.181
this was a business arrangement.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.350
I thought I was on a date.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.422
There's no way
I could ever date you.

09:15.455 --> 09:17.124
You are way
too high maintenance.

09:17.157 --> 09:20.527
Excuse me?

09:20.560 --> 09:23.130
"Rub me, watch me, flip me."

09:23.163 --> 09:25.232
My God, it never ends.

09:25.265 --> 09:28.235
Give me my money back
or I will call the police

09:28.268 --> 09:29.536
and incessantly stalk you

09:29.569 --> 09:33.173
and tell all your clients
you have crabs!

09:36.143 --> 09:38.378
I...

09:38.411 --> 09:41.581
That was my Mazda payment
this month.

09:41.615 --> 09:44.484
All right, wait,
wait. Maybe...

09:44.517 --> 09:46.219
I could work it off.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.420
How?

09:47.454 --> 09:49.957
Finger fun in the bathroom?
No!

09:49.990 --> 09:51.224
Nothing sexual!

09:51.258 --> 09:52.592
What else can you do?

09:52.626 --> 09:53.927
I don't know.

09:53.961 --> 09:56.897
So, boning.
Boning is all you do.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.666
Well, I used to do handiwork.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.068
That's how I got the name
"Handy Randy."

10:01.101 --> 10:03.737
Okay, well, I have
a bunch of odd jobs

10:03.771 --> 10:05.272
I need done around my apartment,

10:05.305 --> 10:07.440
so you can work off
what I paid you,

10:07.474 --> 10:09.076
and then we will call
what happened

10:09.109 --> 10:12.746
"consensual sex between
two non-paying parties."

10:12.780 --> 10:14.147
Okay, fine. Deal.

10:14.181 --> 10:17.584
Great. I will call you
with times that work for me.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.687
She was also my ride.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.689
Use your thumb.

10:21.722 --> 10:24.024
I know you can.

10:28.896 --> 10:32.465
I feel like Bruce Willis,
crawling through the air ducts

10:32.499 --> 10:35.836
trying to save everyone
at Nakatomi Plaza.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.605
Bruce Willis walked barefoot
through broken glass.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.008
You have pillows tied around
your shins.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.610
It's because
I'm thinking like a rat.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.680
If I'm a rat,
I run straight up the pant leg

10:46.714 --> 10:49.616
and make a beeline
for the balls.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.618
What do you think
Bruce Willis would do

10:51.651 --> 10:52.886
if someone took his jacket?

10:52.920 --> 10:56.289
Seriously?
Still, with the jacket?

10:56.323 --> 10:57.624
He didn't return it!

10:57.657 --> 10:59.626
He said he would return it,
and he did not.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.994
I checked the porch five times.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.129
Is it possible

11:02.162 --> 11:03.630
that you're upset
about this jacket

11:03.663 --> 11:05.799
because Lowell looks better
in it than you do?

11:05.833 --> 11:10.203
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say that.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.305
Oh, my God, there he is!

11:12.339 --> 11:13.741
I see him! He's huge!

11:13.774 --> 11:14.875
All right, I'm gonna flush him
through the vent.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.676
Wait, no!
I'm at the vent!

11:19.079 --> 11:21.481
Hit him with the broom!
Hit him with the broom!

11:21.514 --> 11:22.716
I forgot the broom!

11:22.750 --> 11:24.752
I do not have the broom!

11:32.459 --> 11:35.428
I didn't get him.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.439
All right, guys, I've been
working on this non-stop,

11:46.473 --> 11:48.408
and I finally think
I got it. Ready?

11:48.441 --> 11:50.043
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:53.580 --> 11:56.349
It's in my hair.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.552
I want it in my hair.

11:59.586 --> 12:01.521
Me, too.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.556
I'll take some.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.392
Oh.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.695
Okay, wish me luck.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.063
Hey, good luck, babe.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.868
Can you believe
that guy?

12:14.902 --> 12:17.537
Not only did he not return
my jacket. He's wearing it.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.406
Again. I'm saying
something.

12:19.439 --> 12:20.640
No. Hey,

12:20.673 --> 12:22.742
he's a real piece of work.

12:22.776 --> 12:25.578
You got to beat him
at his own game.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.047
I'm listening.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.382
You borrow something
of his, and then,

12:29.416 --> 12:30.750
when he asks for it back,

12:30.784 --> 12:32.652
hold it ransom
until he returns the jacket.

12:32.685 --> 12:37.157
Wow. Plotting comes
so easily to you.

12:37.190 --> 12:40.493
Yeah, well, I'm too old
to play with dolls.

12:41.661 --> 12:43.663
Handy Randy, huh?

12:43.696 --> 12:45.065
Yeah, he's my handyman.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.300
He's doing some work
around my place.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.768
Hi. Randy, it's Kate.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.403
Just calling about tomorrow.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.272
I will see you at 9:00 a.m.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.742
Don't be late, or else.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.378
Wow. You ride your
handyman hard.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.885
You have no idea.

13:06.653 --> 13:08.088
Hey, coffee
on the house, guys?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.657
We're sampling
an exquisite new African bean

13:10.690 --> 13:13.460
that was harvested
from mongoose dung.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.430
You're serving booze now, right?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.531
Yeah.

13:18.565 --> 13:21.034
Then I'll always have that.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.169
Hey, Lowell, I like
your sunglasses.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.871
Do you mind if
I try them on?

13:23.904 --> 13:26.306
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
sure thing, mate.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.112
Wow.
Right?

13:32.145 --> 13:34.447
Will, those look great on you.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.782
Yeah?
Yeah.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.650
Lowell, would you
mind if I borrow...?

13:37.684 --> 13:39.352
You should keep them.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.857
What?

13:43.891 --> 13:45.959
No. You know how sometimes
you buy things

13:45.993 --> 13:47.961
that are clearly meant
for someone else?

13:47.995 --> 13:51.531
No, I'm just glad they found
their rightful owner-- you.

13:51.564 --> 13:54.968
That shifty, shifty bastard.

13:55.002 --> 13:58.171
He turned the social contract
on its head!

13:58.205 --> 13:59.739
Now you have sunglasses
you don't want

13:59.772 --> 14:01.208
instead of the jacket you do.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.375
Exactly.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.277
And I lied.
Those look ridiculous on you.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.948
God, this poo
coffee's got to go.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.083
I've called, like,
a dozen contractors.

14:10.117 --> 14:12.085
None of them can make it
till at least Monday.

14:12.119 --> 14:13.820
Andi's coming home
this afternoon.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.222
I can't let her
see the ceiling.
You're in luck.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.090
Kate was just talking
about her handyman.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.059
You should call him,
see if he's available.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.528
She seemed very enthusiastic
about him.

14:21.561 --> 14:24.164
Hey, well, I have no choice
but to hire someone.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.566
This guy better not try
to ream me.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.007
Handy Randy?

14:34.041 --> 14:35.909
Bobby, right?
Yes.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.210
Thank you for
coming so quickly.

14:37.244 --> 14:39.446
Really got to get
this taken care of

14:39.479 --> 14:41.448
before my wife gets home.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.784
If I had a nickel
for every time I heard that.

14:44.817 --> 14:48.121
All right, so, uh, you
want to get started?

14:48.155 --> 14:51.224
Yeah, well, just to warn you,
it's a pretty big hole.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.562
I'm sure I've seen bigger.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.199
I got to tell you,

14:59.232 --> 15:02.702
I've had a hard time
getting a guy up there.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.605
Well, I'm your man.

15:08.775 --> 15:12.012
Okay, well, want
to follow me in the bedroom?

15:12.812 --> 15:15.415
Wherever you want
a rodeo, boss.

15:17.817 --> 15:20.120
So you think it'll
be dry up there

15:20.153 --> 15:21.821
by the time my wife gets home?

15:21.854 --> 15:24.391
I guess that depends
on when we finish.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.827
She's a bit of a neat freak so
try not to get any on the bed.

15:27.860 --> 15:30.630
Hmm. Challenge accepted.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.665
Hey, have you guys
started yet?

15:32.699 --> 15:34.767
Randy, this is my partner, Will.

15:34.801 --> 15:37.070
And roommate.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.905
And your wife's okay with this?

15:38.938 --> 15:41.541
She wasn't at first,
but she's coming around.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.144
Do you mind if I watch?

15:44.177 --> 15:45.845
I want to learn from an expert

15:45.878 --> 15:48.415
so next time maybe
I can help Bobby out myself.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.850
If Bobby's cool with it.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.285
Oh, if you promise
not to hop around

15:52.319 --> 15:53.820
and squeal like
you did last time.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.955
Hey, last time,
you took me by surprise.

15:55.989 --> 15:58.958
All right, this time,
I'm ready for it.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.296
So, where are
your tools?

16:03.330 --> 16:05.698
I only need one.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.702
Let's see it.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.981
What was that?!

16:22.015 --> 16:23.983
I don't know.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.286
Well, why did you push me
in front of you?!

16:26.319 --> 16:28.821
I'm sorry, but when that thing
was coming at me,

16:28.855 --> 16:30.723
it was every man for himself.

16:32.259 --> 16:35.328
Hey, did you guys know
there's a giant rat up there?!

16:41.934 --> 16:44.071
I'll tell you one thing.

16:44.104 --> 16:47.040
I do not think
that guy was a handyman.

16:51.044 --> 16:53.146
Hey, guys,
I brought wine.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.748
You slept with a
male prostitute.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.824
Well, it took a while,
but I got all of them.

17:04.857 --> 17:05.758
Them?

17:05.792 --> 17:07.527
Yeah, she had babies.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.528
Lots of 'em.

17:08.561 --> 17:09.662
They're really small, too.

17:09.696 --> 17:10.897
I mean, they can
get in anywhere.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.835
Okay, what do
I owe you?

17:15.868 --> 17:16.903
Well, there's the flat fee

17:16.936 --> 17:18.037
for the visit,
labor and materials.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.506
Of course, there's no guarantee

17:19.539 --> 17:21.108
they won't come back, so
I'd recommend purchasing our...

17:21.141 --> 17:24.677
Monthly warranty plan.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.845
We'll take it.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.580
Thank you.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.850
Go ahead and say it.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.285
Say what?

17:32.319 --> 17:33.853
If I had hired a professional
in the first place,

17:33.886 --> 17:35.054
we would have
spent less money

17:35.088 --> 17:36.356
and had a lot less
of a headache.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.091
Plus, you wouldn't
have almost had sex

17:38.125 --> 17:39.926
with a man-whore.

17:39.959 --> 17:42.862
I guess I just wanted to feel
like I can take care of things.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.631
Of course you can
take care of things.

17:44.664 --> 17:48.401
You're an excellent husband
and father and doctor.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.903
Even though you almost slept
with a man-whore.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.575
Good news. Got the Shimmering
Essence commercial.

17:55.608 --> 17:56.909
Bad news--

17:56.943 --> 18:00.247
tried Shimmering Essence.

18:01.314 --> 18:04.384
I'm gonna use it to
stuff a dream pillow.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.720
There's plenty of it
all over my jacket.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.656
Actually, it's my jacket.

18:09.689 --> 18:10.890
I lent it to you, and

18:10.923 --> 18:12.325
you've decided to keep it,

18:12.359 --> 18:14.394
which is a total violation
of the social contract.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.728
Hey, whoa, there, mate...

18:15.762 --> 18:17.964
Don't "whoa, mate" me, okay?

18:17.997 --> 18:21.301
I am tired of people thinking
they can just take my stuff.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.836
My house, my car,
my dog, my jacket.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.805
You're just like my ex-wife.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.441
And, yes,
I realize what I just said.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.143
Oh, my God,
I'm having an epiphany!

18:30.177 --> 18:32.845
No, this is good, mate.
Let out the poison.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.215
All right, I will!

18:35.882 --> 18:37.784
That's it, it's out!

18:37.817 --> 18:39.085
Looks like someone could use

18:39.118 --> 18:40.953
a little bit of hug therapy.
Get here.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.689
Come on.

18:42.722 --> 18:47.126
Yeah, yeah. Still really want
my jacket back.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.463
What is that?

18:50.497 --> 18:52.031
Lowell left it
on the porch yesterday.

18:52.064 --> 18:54.000
I must have forgotten
to mention it.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.468
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.604
I liked yours so much,
I had to get one for myself.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.839
Did you think I've had yours
this whole time?

19:02.809 --> 19:05.878
I saw a strange
penis today.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.958
You know, I think all the
rats are probably gone.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.693
Oh, totally,
I'm sure of it.

19:20.727 --> 19:23.596
Just a few
more nights.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.401
