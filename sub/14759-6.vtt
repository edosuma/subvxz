Given the circumstances,

03:44.067 --> 03:45.800

 that that was wise.

Really? Why not?

03:47.467 --> 03:48.867

he could have had
 time to conceal
 the evidence, and...

03:52.967 --> 03:55.400

 it was better to drop

I think I'm a better judge
 of what my
 best interests are.

19:01.067 --> 19:03.433
Let it go, Anna. Move on.

19:03.467 --> 19:05.567
It's not healthy to
 dwell on your past.

19:26.100 --> 19:28.333
Stop, it's the wrong blood.

19:28.967 --> 19:30.833
She's O, she's not AB.

19:30.867 --> 19:32.300
It says AB on her chart.

19:32.333 --> 19:33.767
Then her chart's
bloody wrong.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.300
I know.
 I'm her daughter.

19:35.333 --> 19:38.600
Who, as I understand,
 hasn't been around
 for the last 15 years.

19:38.633 --> 19:39.833
Unless she's had leukaemia

19:39.867 --> 19:42.667
and a bone marrow transplant
 in the last 15 years,

19:42.700 --> 19:46.400
which presumably you'd know,
 being her doctor,
 she can't be AB.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.100
Right.

19:48.867 --> 19:50.333
I'll check.

19:50.867 --> 19:52.167
Again.

20:06.833 --> 20:08.667
RENAE: Barb.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.167
BARBARA:
 How are you?

20:10.200 --> 20:11.633
Is Travis around?

20:12.733 --> 20:14.700
He's away at the moment. Why?

20:17.833 --> 20:20.000
Did he ever talk to you
about Chloe?

20:21.300 --> 20:23.767
No. Why are you
asking me that?

20:23.800 --> 20:25.633
RENAE: He used to hassle her.

20:25.667 --> 20:27.667
Follow her around.
 Do you know that?

20:28.367 --> 20:29.900
Why are you being like this?

20:29.933 --> 20:32.967
Because my daughter
is lying on a cold slab
in the morgue

20:33.000 --> 20:34.900
and some fucker
killed her, that's why.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.400
You don't have to
 take it out on me.

20:36.433 --> 20:38.033
I lost a daughter, too,
you know.

20:38.067 --> 20:40.200
Of course I bloody know!

20:40.233 --> 20:43.733
It's all this town's heard
 about for the past 15 years.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.667
I'm sorry, I'm just...

20:51.033 --> 20:54.200
I am very, very tired.

20:56.067 --> 20:58.500
(SIGHS) And I want to
 talk to Travis.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.233
You can't bear me
 being happy, can you?

21:03.867 --> 21:05.767
You never liked Travis.

21:05.800 --> 21:10.700
He's never stood up beside
 the likes of Max or the
 other men in this town.

21:10.733 --> 21:13.800
You think I don't know
 how you and the others
 talk about him?

21:15.933 --> 21:17.500
We worry about you.

21:18.100 --> 21:20.600
Don't. Be happy for me.

21:23.300 --> 21:25.100
What do you
 really want, Barbara?

21:26.333 --> 21:29.167
I want to know
what happened to Chloe.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.867
(SIGHS) I'm sorry.
 Of course you do.

21:31.900 --> 21:33.500
We all do... We all...

21:38.833 --> 21:41.267
The police will work it out.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.500
They'll catch the bastard.
 I know they will.

21:45.100 --> 21:47.067
You just have to have faith.

21:48.300 --> 21:50.167
You just have to.

21:57.433 --> 22:02.533
ELIZA: I used to think that
 if I went up the mountain
 and the moon was full,

22:02.567 --> 22:06.167
that I'd just be able to,
 like, climb up onto it.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.700
It's like there's a whole
 another world up there.

22:10.633 --> 22:12.467
Like two for
 the price of one.

22:13.667 --> 22:16.600
They're just a trick
 of the light, Lize.

22:16.633 --> 22:19.667
It's just dust and shit
in the atmosphere.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.133
ELIZA: Do you miss her?

22:24.967 --> 22:26.233
I do.

22:28.433 --> 22:30.067
Like every day.

22:32.600 --> 22:33.733
Don't.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.267
Who else have I got
 to talk to?

22:42.367 --> 22:45.100
Look... (SIGHS)
 I gotta go to work.

22:45.133 --> 22:46.800
My shift starts at three.

22:50.900 --> 22:52.167
ELIZA: Wait.

22:56.267 --> 22:58.300
Can you give me a hug?

23:00.833 --> 23:02.567
So that I don't disappear?

23:19.500 --> 23:21.300
DR PATRICK: I think
 you'll find our test results

23:21.333 --> 23:23.267
are a little more accurate
 than your memory.

23:23.300 --> 23:25.767
I know my mother's
 blood type because
 I know my own.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.833
Whatever her grouping is now,
 it's changed from what it was.

23:28.867 --> 23:30.933
Your mother has lost
 a lot of blood.

23:30.967 --> 23:33.567
She needs a transfusion, now.

23:45.833 --> 23:47.067
How is she?

23:47.100 --> 23:48.800
Do you know Mum's blood type?

23:48.833 --> 23:50.500
-No, why?
-Oh, forget it.

23:50.533 --> 23:53.233
Fergus said
 you found her out at
 the Sullivan house.

23:53.267 --> 23:54.800
What were you
 doing right out there?

23:54.833 --> 23:57.233
-I went out there
 to murder her.
 -Anna.

23:57.267 --> 23:59.400
I go out there sometimes
 and check on Gillian's corpse.

23:59.433 --> 24:01.067
Now cut it out, will you?

24:01.067 --> 24:03.267
-Well, that's what
 you think, isn't it?
 -I don't think that.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.367
Is that Yeats?

24:10.900 --> 24:13.333
She likes it
 when I read to her.

24:15.967 --> 24:17.400
She would.

24:22.133 --> 24:23.667
FERGUS: Anna told me
 that she was found

24:23.700 --> 24:26.500
up at Mother Sullivan's Ridge
 when Gillian went missing.

24:27.067 --> 24:28.867
What?

24:28.900 --> 24:31.900
Well, everyone thought
 that she was found
 in Kettering Forest.

24:31.933 --> 24:34.133
That's where they went.

24:34.167 --> 24:37.200
But she was found
 up at the old Sullivan house.

24:39.067 --> 24:41.533
Isn't that an odd
 coincidence?

24:41.567 --> 24:45.067
Yeah, it would be
 if I believed in
 coincidences.

24:47.067 --> 24:48.400
Barb. Max.

24:49.733 --> 24:51.067
This way.

24:52.900 --> 24:54.467
BARBARA:
 Who could have
 done this to her?

24:54.500 --> 24:56.367
FERGUS: That's what we're
 going to find out, Barb.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.667
Now, are you sure
 there was no one
 that she was seeing,

24:58.700 --> 25:01.067
or that she may have
 met up there, or...

25:02.133 --> 25:05.367
She used to go
 up there, sometimes.

25:05.400 --> 25:08.200
You know, with that
 stupid UFO group.

25:08.233 --> 25:11.233
-Lofty Sullivan's part of
 that group, isn't he?
 -BARBARA: Lofty?

25:11.267 --> 25:13.233
He wouldn't hurt Chloe.

25:13.267 --> 25:15.267
She used to knit for him.

25:15.300 --> 25:17.533
It was Chloe that was
 tipping off the Greenies.

25:19.367 --> 25:20.333
What?

25:20.367 --> 25:22.400
DUTCH: We found
 papers in her car.

25:22.433 --> 25:24.300
Emails from your computer.

25:25.133 --> 25:27.067
I don't believe you.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.733
Where were you
 the night she was killed, Max?

25:28.767 --> 25:30.367
-Dutch.
-I was at home.

25:31.867 --> 25:33.067
Tell him.

25:35.967 --> 25:37.233
Barb.

25:41.467 --> 25:42.600
I don't know.

25:45.767 --> 25:47.600
-FERGUS: Were you home, Barb?
 -No.

25:49.600 --> 25:50.800
I was at Renae's.

25:52.167 --> 25:53.800
So you were
home alone, Max?

25:54.900 --> 25:56.133
Yes.

25:58.633 --> 26:00.267
What the fuck is this?

26:02.467 --> 26:05.567
Are you accusing me
 of killing my own
 daughter now?

26:05.600 --> 26:10.367
We believe Chloe's body
 was up at Mother Sullivan's
 Ridge at some point.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.567
You own that property
with Grayson, don't you?

26:12.600 --> 26:13.500
Yes.

26:13.533 --> 26:16.067
We've got forensics
 about to go in.

26:16.100 --> 26:18.433
Your daughter's body
had radiation poisoning.

26:18.467 --> 26:21.400
Now is there anything
up there that might have
caused it?

26:21.433 --> 26:24.067
No. It's a bloody forest.

26:24.100 --> 26:25.633
I mean, how would
radiation get up there?

26:25.667 --> 26:27.533
DUTCH: We'll just have to
 wait and see.

27:03.567 --> 27:04.567
(HOOTING)

27:14.900 --> 27:17.900
Deb, is Matilda here?

27:17.933 --> 27:19.867
None of the girls
 are at dance practise.

27:19.900 --> 27:23.967
I'm not letting Matilda
 out of my sight until they
 find out who killed Chloe.

27:24.067 --> 27:26.433
-None of the mothers are.
 -I understand.

27:28.067 --> 27:30.200
You haven't seen
 Travis in here, have you?

27:30.800 --> 27:32.300
No.

27:32.333 --> 27:34.167
Actually, I haven't
 seen him in a while.

27:35.800 --> 27:38.767
Never mind.
 He's probably at
 the Cygnet office.

27:45.067 --> 27:46.500
(GIRL GIGGLING)

28:08.467 --> 28:09.633
Fergus?

28:14.167 --> 28:16.567
Think we can rule out
a university professor.

28:16.600 --> 28:19.233
More than half the town
 still thinks Anna did it,
 you know?

28:19.267 --> 28:20.233
So?

28:20.267 --> 28:22.067
More than half the town
believes in spaceships.

28:22.067 --> 28:24.067
But you don't believe
 she did it?

28:25.433 --> 28:26.467
No.

28:28.833 --> 28:30.100
I don't.

28:30.133 --> 28:32.067
Is that the cop speaking,
 or your trousers?

28:32.067 --> 28:36.133
I'm not rootin'
 the murderer',
 if that's what you're saying.

28:39.700 --> 28:41.433
But somewhere you'd like to.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.333
What is it about people
who leave a place

28:45.367 --> 28:48.667
that makes them so much
more attractive than
those of us who stay?

28:50.167 --> 28:54.967
Is it you just
get bored with the same
breakfast cereal,

28:55.067 --> 28:57.833
or do they pick up
something overseas that
makes them so special?

28:57.867 --> 28:59.267
It's not like that.

29:01.167 --> 29:02.567
And you are special.

29:03.667 --> 29:06.067
Yeah, I know that.

29:06.067 --> 29:09.300
And if she'd never
 come back, you would have
 really known that.

29:11.067 --> 29:13.200
Now neither of us
 gets what we want.

29:13.233 --> 29:14.700
Don't you want a shower?

29:15.900 --> 29:18.700
My hot water was fixed
 over a month ago.

 I don't think this is
 a good idea, Dr Macy.

29:50.867 --> 29:52.733
Now you're back,
I'm getting calls again.

29:54.400 --> 29:55.667
From whom?

29:56.100 --> 29:57.667
I have no idea.

29:57.700 --> 30:00.067
They call, stay on the line
 and then they hang up.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.100
I just need to run
 some tests on Mum's blood.

30:05.133 --> 30:07.500
There's something so strange.

30:07.533 --> 30:08.900
Like what?

30:08.933 --> 30:10.700
You used to treat her.

30:10.733 --> 30:12.500
That was a good while ago.

30:12.533 --> 30:14.033
She never had leukaemia

30:14.067 --> 30:17.100
or anything that required
 a bone marrow
 transplant, did she?

30:17.133 --> 30:18.533
Not while she was my patient.

30:18.567 --> 30:21.033
Her blood group's
 changed from O to AB.

30:25.400 --> 30:27.300
ANNA: What the hell is that?

30:27.333 --> 30:29.800
Her red cells
 are showing severe
 anisocytoses.

30:30.767 --> 30:32.167
Can you see that?

30:33.033 --> 30:34.400
They're smaller and denser.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.433
DR McKENZIE: Looks more
bovine than human.

30:37.600 --> 30:40.033
I'll send it off for
 electron micrographs.

30:40.067 --> 30:42.033
I had another vial
 of blood checked.

30:42.067 --> 30:43.333
A young boy's.

30:43.367 --> 30:44.533
I thought he had
hemochromatosis

30:44.567 --> 30:46.900
but the results didn't
 make any sense to me.

30:46.933 --> 30:49.500
It's like the analyser
 wasn't picking up
 any cells at all.

30:49.533 --> 30:50.800
But he had the markings?

30:53.667 --> 30:55.067
It's happening again.

30:56.833 --> 30:58.433
This is no coincidence.

30:58.467 --> 31:00.833
Personality changes,
 cancer clusters.

31:00.867 --> 31:02.800
All in the area of Kettering.

31:02.833 --> 31:04.700
It has to be
 connected to this.

31:04.733 --> 31:06.067
How much did you know?

31:06.067 --> 31:09.200
I didn't get this far.
 I was asked to leave.

31:09.233 --> 31:10.867
Well you must have
 kept records.

31:10.900 --> 31:12.567
Show them to me.

31:14.967 --> 31:16.800
No, I'm sorry.

the best oysters in the

God knows what
got washed down.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.800
There's only trees up there.

32:49.833 --> 32:52.267
It's never been logged.
It's old growth.

32:52.300 --> 32:54.067
Something's up there.

32:54.067 --> 32:57.700

 the oysters are deformed
 and we're rooted.

doesn't matter.

33:22.067 --> 33:26.133
I haven't personally seen
 blood groups change but
 it is conceivable, I suppose.

33:26.167 --> 33:28.067

 we know today.

33:28.067 --> 33:31.167

 markings you were
 talking about yesterday?

33:35.733 --> 33:37.067

33:37.067 --> 33:40.567
Yes, so the markings.
 I don't know.

 your resignation,

33:45.800 --> 33:47.900

 we need to talk about.

33:47.933 --> 33:51.867

 concerning Frank Henderson,
 your patient who died.

33:51.900 --> 33:54.167
-Can it wait?
 -No, it can't.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.067

 time for you?

33:56.100 --> 33:59.067
Tim, I've got to
call back.
I've gotta go.

34:00.633 --> 34:05.667
DOMINIC: Science,
or rather the men
who controlled science,

34:05.700 --> 34:09.333
don't appreciate it
 when their rules
 are challenged.

34:10.100 --> 34:13.533
Of course,
we used to have religion

34:13.567 --> 34:17.567
and that told us that
 the earth was created
 7,000 years ago,

34:17.600 --> 34:23.533
it was flat, and the sun
revolved around us
because God told it to.

34:24.300 --> 34:26.400
Now, we have science.

34:26.433 --> 34:29.900
Science is the God
 to who we all pray

34:29.933 --> 34:35.300
and it tells us that
 our sun is, in fact,
 a perfectly spherical star

34:35.333 --> 34:42.266
made up of hot plasma,
 held together by incredibly
 powerful magnetic forces.

34:42.300 --> 34:47.433
But there are still things
 that science can't explain.

34:47.467 --> 34:49.266
It can't explain your soul.

34:49.300 --> 34:53.233
Does a rush of hormones
and testosterone

34:53.266 --> 34:58.233
fully describe what it is
 to fall in love?

34:58.267 --> 35:03.333
And can science explain
the excruciating loss

35:03.367 --> 35:08.267
we feel when that person
we love most dies?

35:09.967 --> 35:14.300
Science doesn't have
 all the answers.

35:15.500 --> 35:18.700
I was working at
 an Antarctic base in 1998.

35:18.733 --> 35:22.767
Whilst I was there,
 I witnessed things,
 recorded things,

35:22.800 --> 35:27.133
that are beyond
 the understanding of
 Newtonian physics.

35:27.167 --> 35:31.600
Geomagnetic anomalies
 so bizarre

35:31.633 --> 35:37.333
that the government
 felt it necessary to
 stifle all further research.

35:39.767 --> 35:41.167
Anna, you came.

35:46.367 --> 35:48.533
You said something
 about the humming.

35:48.567 --> 35:50.167
What do you know?

35:50.200 --> 35:55.333
Ah, it's related to
 a signal I first detected
 down in Antarctica.

35:55.367 --> 35:58.200
It wasn't recognised
 by universal codes.

35:58.233 --> 35:59.700
ANNA: It could be
a submarine, or a drone.

35:59.733 --> 36:02.367
DOMINIC: All I know is that
 the signal's intensity

36:02.400 --> 36:05.100
increases during
 heightened solar activity.

36:05.133 --> 36:09.467
A team of scientists
 were working near
 the source of the signal.

36:13.967 --> 36:15.633
They were out there
 for four or five days.

36:15.667 --> 36:18.833
When they didn't return,
 a search party was sent out.

36:18.867 --> 36:23.767
Apparently, one of them
 had gone completely mad
 and murdered the other five.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.067
What happened to him?

36:26.733 --> 36:29.267
Died of exposure, presumably.

36:29.300 --> 36:31.967
No body was ever found.

36:32.067 --> 36:35.500
The whole thing was
 hushed up, of course.

36:35.533 --> 36:37.933

caused this man
to be so violent?

36:37.967 --> 36:39.767

 electromagnetic waves

 on the human body.

 "And kiss her lips
 and take her hands,

50:46.467 --> 50:49.367
"And walk among
 long dappled grass,

50:49.400 --> 50:52.600
"And pluck till time
 and times are done,

ROY: "The silver apples
 of the moon,

50:57.467 --> 51:00.133

 of the sun."
