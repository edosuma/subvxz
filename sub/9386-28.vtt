WEBVTT

00:01.376 --> 00:05.088
It seems today
that all you see

00:05.172 --> 00:08.050
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.133 --> 00:12.095
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:12.179 --> 00:15.015
On which we used to rely?

00:15.098 --> 00:18.393
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.477 --> 00:21.438
Lucky there's a man
who positively can do

00:21.522 --> 00:23.273
All the things
that make us

00:23.357 --> 00:25.108
Laugh and cry

00:25.192 --> 00:30.572
He's... a...
Fam...ily... Guy

00:34.743 --> 00:37.412
Hey, Stewie. How 'bout
daddy teaches ya how to swim?

00:37.496 --> 00:40.499
Go... away... fat man.

00:40.582 --> 00:43.335
(yells) What do you think you're doing?
"No" means "no"!

00:43.418 --> 00:45.337
(yells)
Okay. Here goes.

00:45.420 --> 00:48.841
-(yelling)
-Come on, Stewie. In... the... pool.

00:48.924 --> 00:53.178
No! No, I don't want
to die! I want to live! Live!

00:53.262 --> 00:56.557
Peter, stop it.
He's never gonna learn like that.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.017
Maybe this summer
he should take swim lessons.

00:59.101 --> 01:00.936
-Would ya like that, Stewie?
-Hmm.

01:01.019 --> 01:03.647
Well, I guess it couldn't be worse than
that summer I spent in India.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.858
Whatever you do, Short Round,
don't touch anything.

01:05.941 --> 01:08.986
(mock Asian accent)
Okay, Dr. Jones, I no touch anything.

01:10.779 --> 01:11.989
Indy!

01:12.072 --> 01:14.616
Lady only here
'cause she humping director.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.914
Whoa. Look at this place.
What happened to Sal's Video?

01:20.998 --> 01:24.001
We bought them out two weeks ago.
Welcome to Lackluster Video

01:24.084 --> 01:25.502
50,000 stores
nationwide.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.755
Yeah, well, uh, you know, I used to come
into Sal's once or twice a week...

01:28.839 --> 01:32.426
to rent movies from his,
uh... back room.

01:32.509 --> 01:35.929
You know what I mean?
Room for, uh, adults only.

01:36.013 --> 01:40.851
Catch my drift? The, uh, kind of movies
where there are x-rated pornos..

01:40.934 --> 01:42.978
and fully nude people
fornicate for the camera.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.439
-Get my meaning?
-Oh, I'm sorry, but Lackluster Video...

01:45.522 --> 01:47.774
takes a strong moral stance
against pornography,

01:47.858 --> 01:49.484
open-mindedness
and non-Christians.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.361
Oh, yeah?
Then why do you rent Prince of Tides?

01:51.445 --> 01:52.946
Barbra Streisand is Jewish.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.281
We edit some
of our movies.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.366
I think I'm in love
with you, doctor.

01:56.450 --> 02:00.621
No, Tom, you're wrong. You don't love me.
You love the idea of me.

02:00.704 --> 02:03.457
Hi, I'm Tom Tucker.
Do me a favor and fill this bag...

02:03.540 --> 02:04.958
with a sampling
of motion pictures

02:05.042 --> 02:07.669
featuring women-on-women
or anything with an amputee.

02:07.753 --> 02:10.255
Save your money, Tucker.
This place doesn't have porn.

02:10.339 --> 02:11.965
They think it's immoral.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.134
You know, that really
grinds my gears.

02:14.218 --> 02:15.594
Where exactly
in the Bible does it say

02:15.677 --> 02:17.429
a man can't fire off
some knuckle-children...

02:17.513 --> 02:20.390
in the privacy of his own neighbor's
living room, while his neighbor's at work

02:20.474 --> 02:22.017
because I don't have
a DVD player?

02:22.100 --> 02:25.354
I don't know where it says it
because the Bible is way too long to read.

02:25.437 --> 02:27.231
Hey, that was quite
a rant there.

02:27.314 --> 02:30.901
You know, we're looking for an everyman
to rant about petty, nonsensical irritants

02:30.984 --> 02:33.028
to replace our "Spotlight
on the Middle East" segment.

02:33.111 --> 02:34.696
Hey! I'd be great at that!

02:34.780 --> 02:38.200
I've been dying to get back on television
ever since I stopped hosting Family Feud.

02:38.283 --> 02:42.746
How are you, Betsy? Welcome to the show.
You are a lovely young woman.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.541
And let me just stick my hand up there
and feel that one.

02:45.624 --> 02:47.209
-(gasps)
-And that one.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.878
We're looking for somethin'
you shop for at the mall. Three seconds.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.219
Come on, Stewie.
Don't be afraid.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.805
It's just water.
It's not gonna bite.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.307
Shut up! I know
it's not going to bite, stupid.

03:02.391 --> 03:03.976
What a stupid thing to say.

03:04.059 --> 03:06.478
You drown in it, you moron.
It doesn't have to bite you.

03:06.562 --> 03:10.440
Hey, little guy. Take a look at Brad
over there. He's my star pupil.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.609
-See how brave he is?
-(scoffs) He's not brave.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.112
I'll tell you
who was brave-- Gandhi.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.823
And the Americans
are always like, "hey, bitch."

03:17.906 --> 03:21.994
And the Indian people,
we do not call our women in such a way.

03:22.077 --> 03:24.204
MAN:
Boo! You suck!

03:28.166 --> 03:31.879
So, is it just pool water that turns you
into a sniveling girl, or is it all water?

03:31.962 --> 03:34.840
Mom! Brian's asking me
if it's just pool water that turns me

03:34.923 --> 03:36.967
into a sniveling girl
or if it's all water!

03:37.050 --> 03:40.179
I heard that Olympic swimmers
shave all the hair off their head

03:40.262 --> 03:41.722
and their private areas

03:41.805 --> 03:43.390
to make 'em move faster.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.392
I don't need some
stupid gimmick.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.103
Soon as I improve my technique,
I'll outswim Brad

03:48.187 --> 03:50.314
as easily as I took care
of that other boy.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.859
-Casper, go long!
-(tires screeching)

03:53.942 --> 03:57.321
-(crash)
-Ooh, sorry about that, man.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.864
Are you dead?
Yeah, whatever.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.241
I was gonna off myself
on Tuesday anyway.

04:01.325 --> 04:04.369
Hey, Peter, shouldn't you be getting ready
for your first news segment?

04:04.453 --> 04:07.873
Yeah. I'm a little nervous,
though. I'm not sure what to talk about.

04:07.956 --> 04:11.126
-You could talk about me. Okay, honey.
-I'll talk about you.

04:11.210 --> 04:15.756
(laughs) "Hey, I'm Meg.
I go to school. I wear glasses."

04:15.839 --> 04:19.259
(all laughing)

04:19.343 --> 04:20.802
Spot on. Spot on.

04:22.930 --> 04:26.058
In other news, after several grueling days
of frightening uncertainty,

04:26.141 --> 04:28.060
I finally get my period.

04:28.143 --> 04:30.771
Well, Diane, I'm sure you and your brother
must be devastated

04:30.854 --> 04:33.273
by the loss of the two-headed offspring
that might have been.

04:33.357 --> 04:37.069
We now go to Peter Griffin for
"You Know What Really Grinds My Gears?"

04:37.152 --> 04:40.155
Thanks, Tom. You know
what really grinds my gears?

04:40.239 --> 04:43.784
Nobody's come up with a new
priest-and-rabbi joke in, like, 30 years.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.786
You know? I mean, okay.
Um, um--

04:45.869 --> 04:49.164
A priest and a rabbi go into
the supermarket and, uh, the priest...

04:49.248 --> 04:51.291
wants to buy a ham
and the rabbi says,

04:51.375 --> 04:53.377
"Uh, I can't eat it.
It's forbidden.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.962
Couldn't eat it.
Not allowed."

04:55.045 --> 04:58.006
Pigs are like superheroes to them.
Is it perfect? No.

04:58.090 --> 05:00.551
I-I don't see you
comin' up with anything.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.970
And that, people,
is what grinds my gears. Tom.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.807
Come on.
You gonna be all day?

05:06.890 --> 05:09.434
-STEWIE: I'm brushing my teeth.
-You only have, like, two.

05:09.518 --> 05:12.980
-I mean, how long could--
oh, God! -Oh. Hey.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.816
Uh... Wow.

05:15.899 --> 05:19.194
(chuckles nervously)
You... doin' a little hair removal there?

05:19.278 --> 05:21.947
Oh, uh-- yeah.

05:22.030 --> 05:25.701
Um... You know, feel free
to say "no" to this, but...

05:25.784 --> 05:28.370
would you shave
my coin purse?

05:29.496 --> 05:32.708
(laughing)

05:33.750 --> 05:37.629
Oh, no! No way, man!

05:37.713 --> 05:42.009
(laughs)
Holy freaking God!

05:42.092 --> 05:44.219
-Oh!
-(scoffs)

05:44.303 --> 05:46.013
Don't have to be so uptight about it.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.893
Okay. We're gonna have
our first fun little race.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.936
When I blow this whistle,
I want all the parents...

05:53.020 --> 05:54.938
to throw their children
into the pool.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.274
If your child doesn't resurface
right away,

05:57.357 --> 05:59.610
they're probably just trying
to get attention.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.570
-Ready?
-Good luck, Stewie.

06:01.653 --> 06:02.946
(imitating Brad)
"Good luck, Stewie."

06:03.030 --> 06:05.157
That's you. That's what
you sound like.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.410
-(blows whistle)
-You're mine, Brad!

06:08.493 --> 06:11.997
Damn, damn, damn,
damn, damn! (gurgling)

06:15.250 --> 06:17.961
(gurgling):
Ew! A band-aid.

06:18.045 --> 06:21.048
-I've got ya, sweetie.
-(choking)

06:24.593 --> 06:27.262
-(chattering)
-(giggles)

06:27.346 --> 06:29.014
(cheering)
Good for you, Brad!

06:29.097 --> 06:31.558
-Oh, isn't he adorable? He's much better
-than my kids.

06:33.560 --> 06:37.064
So, you think you can make me look
like a fool, do you? You little bastard!

06:37.147 --> 06:38.815
Well, guess again!

06:40.192 --> 06:44.363
Oh, Brad! There's a piece of marzipan
over here for you.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.911
-(beeps)
-What the deuce?

06:52.287 --> 06:55.707
-(beeping)
-(grunts)

06:55.791 --> 06:59.920
-(beeping continues)
-(explosion)

07:01.547 --> 07:03.674
(screams)

07:03.757 --> 07:05.092
(crash)

07:08.846 --> 07:11.723
Hell? Now, that's a bit much,
don't you think?

07:11.807 --> 07:15.018
I mean, sure, I've spent my entire life
trying to kill my mother. But who hasn't?

07:15.102 --> 07:17.020
You know, really, for hell
this isn't that bad.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.398
-Hi, there. I'm Steve Allen.
-Oh, hello.

07:19.481 --> 07:21.984
-All right. Let's do this.
-(screams)

07:22.067 --> 07:24.528
(gasps) Ah!
(gasping)

07:24.611 --> 07:26.572
I'm alive. I'm alive!

07:26.655 --> 07:29.700
Oh! Stewie! My baby.

07:29.783 --> 07:33.078
I thought I'd lost you.
Oh! (kissing)

07:33.161 --> 07:36.123
I can't believe it. All these years
I thought I was living in hell,

07:36.206 --> 07:37.875
but it gets so much worse.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.460
This is a sign.
Well, from this day forward,

07:40.544 --> 07:44.006
Stewart Gilligan Griffin
will be a good boy.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.800
I don't understand.
I was only gonna ask him to fix my collar.

07:46.884 --> 07:49.887
Huh. Well, I wonder
what they got on TV in hell.

07:49.970 --> 07:53.015
(TV plays) There's a time for love
and a time for living

07:53.098 --> 07:55.809
-(clicking repeatedly)
-Take a chance and face the wind

08:05.485 --> 08:07.070
Morning, Brian.

08:07.154 --> 08:10.282
Beautiful day, isn't it? Kind of day
that makes you glad to be alive.

08:10.365 --> 08:13.660
I made fudge.
Uh, okay.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.207
Wha-- uh--
what, uh--

08:18.290 --> 08:20.834
-What are you-- what are you doing?
-Well, from the feel of it,

08:20.918 --> 08:22.920
working through
quite a few years of stress.

08:23.003 --> 08:26.340
The thing is, when I died,
I got a glimpse of where I was going...

08:26.423 --> 08:28.675
and, well, I did not
like it one bit.

08:28.759 --> 08:31.428
Wow. I am so
uncomfortable right now.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.514
So, I've resolved
to change my ways,

08:33.597 --> 08:35.724
because I know now
who I want to be.

08:35.807 --> 08:39.561
I have confidence
in sunshine

08:39.645 --> 08:42.814
I have confidence
in rain

08:42.898 --> 08:45.984
I have confidence
that spring will come again

08:46.068 --> 08:49.738
Besides which, you see
I have confidence in me

08:49.821 --> 08:52.115
There you are.
Drink plenty of water.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.118
Hey, Brian.
Yeah?

08:55.202 --> 08:57.204
Thanks for listening.

08:57.287 --> 09:00.791
Boy, that was more disturbing
than that cartoon I saw the other day.

09:03.669 --> 09:08.841
Shh! Be "vewy," "vewy" quiet.
I'm hunting "wabbits."

09:09.883 --> 09:11.802
Nyah, what's up, doc?

09:11.885 --> 09:15.180
(groaning)

09:15.264 --> 09:17.391
Oh, God! Oh, God!

09:17.474 --> 09:20.936
Oh! (groaning)

09:26.441 --> 09:27.943
(bones crack)

09:32.739 --> 09:35.284
Shh! Quiet! Quiet!
Your father's on.

09:35.367 --> 09:38.954
You know what really
grinds my gears? This Lindsay Lohan.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.790
Eh? Lindsay Lohan
with all those little outfits...

09:41.874 --> 09:44.168
jumpin' around there
on stage half-naked...

09:44.251 --> 09:46.128
with your little outfits.

09:46.211 --> 09:49.965
You're up there jumpin' around
and I'm just sittin' here with my beer.

09:50.048 --> 09:52.467
So, you know,
what am I supposed to do?

09:52.551 --> 09:54.970
What do you-- what do you want?
You know, are we gonna go out?

09:55.053 --> 09:57.931
Is that what you're tryin'--
why are you... leapin' around there,

09:58.015 --> 10:00.976
throwin' those things
all up, um, over there in my face?

10:01.059 --> 10:04.980
Huh? What do you want, Lindsay?
Tell me what you want!

10:05.063 --> 10:07.399
Well, I'll tell you
what you want. You want nothin'.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.276
You want nothin'.
All right?

10:09.359 --> 10:13.363
Because we all know that no woman anywhere
wants to have sex with anyone,

10:13.447 --> 10:18.118
and to titillate us
with any thoughts otherwise is just bogus.

10:18.202 --> 10:21.872
Oh! He is so right-on.
Women are such teases.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.916
That's why
I went back to men.

10:23.999 --> 10:28.462
Okay, mom.
Thanks for that. See you later.

10:29.505 --> 10:30.797
Go on.

10:30.881 --> 10:32.382
Another thing that
grinds my gears

10:32.466 --> 10:34.343
is when I can't find
the droids I'm lookin' for.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.720
(amplified voice)
Yeah, me too. What gives with that?

10:36.803 --> 10:38.764
And that's what really
grinds my gears.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.807
MAN: Clear.
Remove my microphone.

10:40.891 --> 10:42.893
-Great job, Mr. Griffin.
-Great job, Peter.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.937
Just terrific.
Just fantastic.

10:45.020 --> 10:47.189
Oh, this gig is even better
than that job I had...

10:47.272 --> 10:50.275
providing nighttime heat
for Lara Flynn Boyle.

10:50.359 --> 10:52.194
Thanks so much, Peter.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.613
-I was getting a little chilly.
-No sweat, Lara.

10:54.696 --> 10:57.199
Hey, you have yourself
a fine sleep.

10:58.492 --> 11:01.203
Hey, Lara.
Yeah?

11:01.328 --> 11:05.123
-Is Dylan McDermott nice in person?
-Yeah.

11:06.708 --> 11:07.876
Good.

11:10.504 --> 11:11.839
I feel ridiculous.

11:11.922 --> 11:14.299
Well, I can't very well
fit you up here, can I?

11:14.383 --> 11:18.470
-Where are we going?
-There is the most absolutely perfect

11:18.554 --> 11:20.806
spider web in the bushes
by Cleveland's house.

11:20.889 --> 11:23.600
-You have just got to see it.
-Oh, for God's sake.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.686
Hey, Brian. Brian.
What?

11:25.769 --> 11:27.896
Knock-knock.
Oh, come on.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.773
Knock-knock.
Who's there?

11:29.857 --> 11:33.318
Your friend, Stewie--
and he's always gonna be there for you.

11:35.487 --> 11:39.366
-Yes. Table for two.
-I'm sorry. We have a 45-minute wait.

11:39.449 --> 11:42.160
Oh, isn't that too bad,
honey?

11:42.244 --> 11:44.997
Because I know waiting
in line at a restaurant...

11:45.080 --> 11:47.124
really, uh,
grinds your gears.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.001
Oh, my God! It's you!

11:49.084 --> 11:52.337
I loved your rant about
how bread is square and baloney is round.

11:52.421 --> 11:54.590
Oh, a table
just opened up.

11:54.673 --> 11:58.886
-Hey! We've been waiting. Shh!
-That's Michael Moore.

11:58.969 --> 12:01.346
Mr. Tucker,
we need this table.

12:01.430 --> 12:02.598
But I've
already ordered.

12:02.681 --> 12:06.560
Oh, we have a private
booth set up for you. This way.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.437
Griffin.
Diane.

12:08.520 --> 12:11.857
I can't believe we got a table
at the hottest restaurant in town...

12:11.940 --> 12:13.442
without a reservation.

12:13.525 --> 12:15.444
We really are
moving up in the world.

12:15.527 --> 12:18.238
Yeah, but I'd love to see
what those private booths are like.

12:21.950 --> 12:24.161
This is totally unacceptable.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.622
How long are you going to be?
I'm very hungry.

12:30.584 --> 12:33.045
Hey, B! Rupert and I
were just about to--

12:33.128 --> 12:35.380
E-e-excuse me.
Did you just call me "B"?

12:35.464 --> 12:37.549
Yes, B. Rupert and I
were just about to dine

12:37.633 --> 12:39.426
on this mixture of Play-Doh
and rug hair.

12:39.510 --> 12:41.512
Care to join?
Oh, no, thanks.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.805
I just thought
you might be interested in seeing this.

12:43.889 --> 12:47.518
This is the most
absolutely perfectly destroyed spider web.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.103
-(gasps) Where's the spider?
-Knock-knock.

12:50.187 --> 12:51.438
Who's there?
I ate him!

12:51.522 --> 12:54.441
You bastard!
Who the hell do you think you are?

12:54.525 --> 12:57.069
Ha! I knew it.
I knew you hadn't really changed.

12:57.152 --> 13:00.739
Okay. So, I was faking being nice.
It's not the worst thing I've done.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.991
(cheering)
(bat hitting ball)

13:03.075 --> 13:05.410
Ooh! Steve, it's coming
right at us. Grab it!

13:05.494 --> 13:08.080
-I don't wanna get in the way.
-It's a foul ball.

13:08.163 --> 13:10.165
What harm can it do?

13:10.249 --> 13:13.460
Look, I really don't want to go to hell,
but I can't fight my nature.

13:13.544 --> 13:16.421
I'm just a hateful person.
You're not hateful.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.465
You just need to control
your anger like I do.

13:18.549 --> 13:20.509
(scoffs)
You mean by being sauced all day?

13:20.592 --> 13:22.719
Wait a minute.
Of course. That's it.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.514
If I'm drunk, I'll be calm.
If I'm calm, I'll be nice.

13:25.597 --> 13:26.932
If I'm nice, I won't go to hell.

13:27.015 --> 13:29.309
Fix me a highball.
I'm going to get good and tight.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.478
Look, you can't drink.
You're an infant, all right?

13:31.562 --> 13:33.689
Besides, there are
better ways to solve your problems.

13:33.772 --> 13:37.109
Oh, I suppose you're right.
Thanks, Brian. I was weak.

13:37.192 --> 13:38.318
No problem.

13:42.739 --> 13:46.535
Oh, my God! Do you know
what it's time for?

13:46.618 --> 13:48.078
A sexy party!

13:48.161 --> 13:51.790
(1960s pop music playing)
(all giggling)

13:57.754 --> 13:59.882
(giggling)

14:10.142 --> 14:14.271
-So, Brian, I-- oh, what?
-I didn't say anything.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.690
I-I thought-- oh, I thought
you interrupted me.

14:16.773 --> 14:19.401
Do-don't interrupt me!
Are you okay?

14:19.484 --> 14:22.487
I'm as okay
as your face.

14:22.571 --> 14:25.199
(laughing)

14:25.282 --> 14:28.785
(wheezing)
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm s-sorry.

14:28.869 --> 14:32.372
So, honey, what are you
going to rant about today?

14:32.456 --> 14:34.958
-Could we get a little preview?
-Oh, I got a good one, Lois.

14:35.042 --> 14:38.128
Parents who let their kids
do anything they want. I hate that.

14:38.212 --> 14:41.131
You know? Like, when I'm in a restaurant
tryin' to enjoy my dinner...

14:41.215 --> 14:45.302
and little baby junior son-of-a-bitch
over there is screaming his head off.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.471
Parents need
to control their kids.

14:47.554 --> 14:51.099
Hey! Everybody, look!
I'm gonna do-- I'm gonna do something...

14:51.183 --> 14:52.518
that's gonna freak you out.

14:52.601 --> 14:56.855
I'm gonna jump from this shelf
to my high chair.

14:56.939 --> 15:00.901
I'm gonna jump. You-- are y-you watching?
Are you? Are you?

15:00.984 --> 15:03.403
Stewie, don't interrupt.
It grinds my gears when you do that.

15:03.487 --> 15:05.822
(screams)
Oh! He said it!

15:05.906 --> 15:07.699
(giggles)

15:07.783 --> 15:10.285
You're gon--
you're gonna-- you're gonna miss it.

15:10.369 --> 15:12.329
You're gonna miss it.
You're gonna miss it.

15:12.412 --> 15:16.083
(crash)
(Stewie groans, laughs)

15:16.166 --> 15:19.127
Oh, g-- oh, dude!
Did you see th-that?

15:19.211 --> 15:21.213
Did you guys--
oh, man. Look at this--

15:21.296 --> 15:24.508
Look at this gash. Look at this gash
right up the side of my leg.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.010
Oh-ho! Oh!
I cut myself deep.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.847
-Oh! It doesn't hurt though.
-Uh, all right. Time for your nap.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.057
Don't worry, Lois.
I'll take him. Let's go.

15:33.058 --> 15:34.893
God! What--
what the hell?

15:34.977 --> 15:37.104
Why are you drag--
why are we in here?

15:37.187 --> 15:39.565
It's rude to the...
other people.

15:39.648 --> 15:41.441
You're drunk.
You're sexy.

15:41.525 --> 15:43.902
Listen, you have to
stop this, all right? No more drinking.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.737
-I'm sorry I even put it in your head.
-I don't know.

15:45.821 --> 15:48.866
I don't even know what your problem is.
I've never felt better.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.952
(vomits)
Okay, now I've never felt better.

15:55.664 --> 15:58.834
You know, Peter, there's gonna be
a lot of people watching tonight.

15:58.917 --> 16:01.670
Better keep your balls
on the prize-- eyeballs--

16:01.753 --> 16:03.380
On the ball.
Eyes on the ball.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.966
(clears throat) Take two.
You know, Peter, there's gonna be...

16:06.049 --> 16:07.801
a lot of people
watching tonight.

16:07.885 --> 16:10.262
Better not screw up.
Use take two.

16:10.345 --> 16:12.973
Don't worry about me, Tom.
I'll be fine.

16:13.056 --> 16:15.267
We're on in three,
two--

16:15.350 --> 16:17.936
And now it's time for
"You Know What Really Grinds my Gears?"

16:18.020 --> 16:20.439
-with Peter Griffin.
-Thanks, Diane.

16:20.522 --> 16:23.692
-You know what really grinds my gears?
-Hey! Hey!

16:23.775 --> 16:26.111
Those x-ray specs
you used to buy out of the comics.

16:26.195 --> 16:29.031
-Hey! Screw up!
-I save up forever to buy these things,

16:29.114 --> 16:30.490
and when I finally get 'em yesterday,

16:30.574 --> 16:32.451
I couldn't see the inside
of my son's belly.

16:32.534 --> 16:37.289
Blah! Bah! Blah!
(blathering)

16:37.372 --> 16:39.666
See, I wanted to see
if he'd eaten the last Nilla wafer...

16:39.750 --> 16:41.502
'cause I told him
I wanted it.

16:41.585 --> 16:44.546
-I tell ya, that really grinds my gears.
-Pay attention to me!

16:44.630 --> 16:47.007
I'm trying to ruin you!

16:47.090 --> 16:49.218
(door opens)
You wanted to see me, sir?

16:49.301 --> 16:53.096
You're fired, Tom. Turn in your press pass
and any other studio property.

16:59.686 --> 17:00.854
What are we doing here?

17:00.938 --> 17:04.274
So, you like being drunk?
Fine. I'm gonna get you so drunk...

17:04.358 --> 17:06.068
you'll never wanna
drink again.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.528
Come on.

17:19.665 --> 17:23.001
Cold. It's so cold.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.712
Thanks, Horace.
Hey, is he 18?

17:25.796 --> 17:28.340
-Horace, the drinking age is 21.
-Oh.

17:29.216 --> 17:32.302
O-okay. Uh, uh...

17:32.386 --> 17:34.012
to the black man.

17:34.096 --> 17:37.558
Thanks for taking
it all in stride.

17:41.603 --> 17:46.108
'Cause suicide
is painless

17:46.191 --> 17:50.445
It brings on
many changes

17:50.529 --> 17:53.532
And I can take
or leave it

17:53.615 --> 17:56.660
If I please

17:58.370 --> 17:59.955
Was that--
was that good?

18:00.038 --> 18:02.291
Oh, God.
Thank you, man.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.962
I can't believe
you saved all those.

18:07.045 --> 18:10.883
L-Lois-- L-Lois--
you think Lois'll like these?

18:10.966 --> 18:13.552
You love Lois!
Shut up!

18:13.635 --> 18:15.929
You know what?
Give me your keys.

18:16.013 --> 18:18.223
-Oh, no. I'm fine. No, no.
-Give me your keys.

18:18.307 --> 18:20.017
I'm fi--
I'm drivin'.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.936
-Give me your keys. You're too drunk.
-I'm okay.

18:23.020 --> 18:26.690
Peter-- Meg-- Brian. You're too--
Brian, you're too drunk to drive.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.984
I-I-I a-am-- I--

18:29.067 --> 18:31.570
You're right. Here.
Here you go.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.451
(engine starts)

18:37.534 --> 18:38.911
(screaming)

18:39.912 --> 18:41.914
Shh!

18:41.997 --> 18:43.624
And that's it for sports.

18:43.707 --> 18:46.710
Now let's go to Ollie Williams
with the adopt-a-pet of the week.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.629
-Who wants this dog?
-Thanks, Ollie.

18:48.712 --> 18:52.257
And now let's go to Peter Griffin
with "You Know What Really Grinds My--"

18:52.341 --> 18:55.010
Tom! What are you doing?
You don't work here anymore.

18:55.093 --> 18:57.304
Well, Diane, I have
an exclusive story--

18:57.387 --> 18:59.723
And I can't figure out
how to check my e-mail from home.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.184
OLLIE: Did you check
your TCP/IP settings? Yes, I did, Ollie.

19:02.267 --> 19:03.644
Enable cookies?
Yes, Ollie.

19:03.727 --> 19:06.313
-You want this dog? No, thank you, Ollie.
-Roll tape.

19:06.396 --> 19:09.066
TOM: This was the scene
at the Drunken Clam last night,

19:09.149 --> 19:11.568
as a car driven by
an intoxicated infant...

19:11.652 --> 19:13.028
caused thousands of
dollars-worth of damage.

19:13.111 --> 19:15.113
Put th--
put this on my tab.

19:15.197 --> 19:17.616
It was--
it was, like, all slowed down.

19:17.699 --> 19:21.203
You know? And I was,
like, "whoa!" But I couldn't stop it.

19:21.286 --> 19:23.872
And who is the father
of the child in that car?

19:23.956 --> 19:25.707
Ooh! Tom! Tom!
I know this. I know this.

19:25.791 --> 19:27.751
Tom, over here. Tom!
Ooh! Ooh!

19:27.835 --> 19:32.005
The man you all respect so much.
Your beloved Peter Griffin.

19:32.089 --> 19:34.633
Good thing he didn't call on me.
I was gonna say "Grant Goodeve."

19:34.716 --> 19:38.887
Thanks, Tom. And now, neglectful father
and Quahog's newest social pariah,

19:38.971 --> 19:41.890
Peter Griffin, with another
segment of "Grind my Gears."

19:42.015 --> 19:43.392
-Peter.
-Thank you, Diane.

19:43.475 --> 19:47.145
You know what really grinds my gears?
People in the 19th century.

19:47.229 --> 19:49.690
Why don't they get
with the freakin' program?

19:49.773 --> 19:54.152
It's called an automobile,
folks. It's much faster than a horse.

19:55.112 --> 19:57.614
Oh. Well, it appears
I've been fired.

19:57.698 --> 20:01.118
Well, as long as I'm no longer
working here, let me tell you somethin'.

20:01.201 --> 20:04.663
You know what really
grinds my gears? You, America.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.957
(bleep) you! Diane.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.085
Hey, Tom. Catch!

20:18.677 --> 20:20.679
Did you miss daddy?
Did you miss daddy?

20:20.762 --> 20:23.932
Oh, no. It's all right.
It's-- oh, you're shaking.

20:29.813 --> 20:32.524
-Go away. Huh.
-Little hung over?

20:32.608 --> 20:34.985
I am never going
to drink again-- ever.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.945
I hope you learned something
from all this.

20:37.029 --> 20:38.197
I certainly did, Brian.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.115
It seems I'm still
finding myself.

20:40.199 --> 20:42.242
But, for the moment,
I've just got to accept the fact...

20:42.326 --> 20:45.204
that I'm an angry boy who'll occasionally
try to burn down a house...

20:45.287 --> 20:46.997
or toss a poison dart
at his mother.

20:47.080 --> 20:50.626
After all, I can't let one near-death
experience change my whole life, can I?

20:50.709 --> 20:53.045
I'm glad you finally
figured that out.

20:53.128 --> 20:55.422
-You gonna be okay?
-Yes, yes, I'll be fine.

20:55.506 --> 20:58.008
I just wish I could remember
where I was last night.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.385
And who the hell "R.M." is.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.140
Oh, got to play
this one right, Roger.

21:05.224 --> 21:08.435
Can't seem desperate.
Wait three days, that's the rule.

21:10.187 --> 21:12.147
Oh, God!
I want to talk to him now!

21:12.231 --> 21:13.815
(dialing)

21:13.899 --> 21:15.108
(ringing)

21:15.192 --> 21:16.235
Damn!

21:19.988 --> 21:22.991
(theme music playing)
