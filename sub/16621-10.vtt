00:09.076 --> 00:11.143
Stop!

00:12.079 --> 00:14.013
(grunting)

00:18.452 --> 00:20.185
Stop!

00:22.256 --> 00:23.422
Freeze!

00:25.593 --> 00:26.658
Stop!

00:29.363 --> 00:31.397
Hands in the air.

00:31.399 --> 00:34.099
Turn around, slowly!

00:36.570 --> 00:37.236

00:38.105 --> 00:39.671

 Media Access Group at WGBH
access.wgbh.org

01:16.644 --> 01:18.310
(indistinct radio transmission)

01:18.312 --> 01:19.311
Thank you.

01:19.313 --> 01:20.746
You're welcome.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.451
This wasn't me.

01:25.453 --> 01:28.554
You think this was
a coincidence, G?

01:28.556 --> 01:30.489
After everything
our team's been through?

01:30.491 --> 01:33.525
They've been after Hetty,
Granger, and me.
I know.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.427
I just feel bad that
the sheriff's department

01:35.429 --> 01:37.696
had to pay the price.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.232
Your dad okay?
Garrison?

01:40.234 --> 01:42.534
Hetty sent him to a secure
location in Santa Barbara

01:42.536 --> 01:44.169
till we figure this out.

01:44.171 --> 01:46.105
You cool with that?

01:46.107 --> 01:48.474
Why wouldn't I be?

01:50.578 --> 01:53.545
We barely know each other,
the guy wants to stay with me?

01:54.849 --> 01:55.848
Agent Callen.

01:55.850 --> 01:57.850
Deputy Bennett.

01:57.852 --> 01:59.785
This is my partner,
Sam Hanna.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.321
Very sorry for your loss,
Deputy.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.489
We know what it's like
to lose a teammate

02:03.491 --> 02:05.074
in the line of duty.

02:05.075 --> 02:06.658
I appreciate that,
but these aren't our guys.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.393
Excuse me?

02:08.395 --> 02:09.795
We have 18,000 employees
in the Los Angeles County

02:09.797 --> 02:11.797
Sheriff's Department,
but these aren't two of them.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.198
I don't know who
these guys are,

02:13.200 --> 02:14.800
but they don't work
for us.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.869
NCIS has a couple of
reasons to look into this,

02:16.871 --> 02:18.270
so we'll be
happy to assist.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.722
Be my guest.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.173
And when you find out
who these chumps are,

02:21.175 --> 02:22.875
impersonating us, let us know.

02:22.877 --> 02:24.676
Will do.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.812
Thank you.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.283
Okay, so if these guys
weren't real sheriffs,

02:31.285 --> 02:33.185
maybe they weren't
here to help you.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.355
Maybe they were here
to kill you.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.623
Yeah, well, then,
who killed them?

02:37.625 --> 02:40.159
You sure your old
man's out of town?

02:42.429 --> 02:44.663
Eric, what do you make
of the security footage

02:44.665 --> 02:45.931
from my yard?

02:45.933 --> 02:48.500
I think our shooter
is a woman.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.536
It wasn't Hetty, was it?

02:50.538 --> 02:52.404
No. Young. Athletic.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.473
CALLEN:
And clearly capable.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.508
So, good news is,
a dog-walker

02:56.510 --> 02:58.644
just called in
a stolen sheriff's car,

02:58.646 --> 03:00.546
and it's
a couple miles from you.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.914
Sending you the address now.

03:01.916 --> 03:04.216
Good work, Nell.
We're on it.

03:06.253 --> 03:09.721
Fact: I once did a
stint as a dog-walker.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.657
I was 15.
Aw.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.525
I bet you were so young
and eager and cute.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.528
Yeah. Maybe
a little<i> too</i> eager.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.397
Uh, first trip out
with the dogs,

03:18.399 --> 03:20.632
I forgot those
little baggies.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.401
That wasn't so cute.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.468
(groans)

03:29.410 --> 03:32.344
(footfalls approaching)

03:32.346 --> 03:35.280
So we just received
confirmation

03:35.282 --> 03:36.481
that the law enforcement
officers killed

03:36.483 --> 03:37.783
on Callen's street last night

03:37.785 --> 03:40.419
were not, in fact,
law enforcement officers.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.454
Eric and I are still
trying to figure out

03:42.456 --> 03:43.822
who these guys are,
in addition to

03:43.824 --> 03:46.225
tracking down the shooter.
I see.

03:46.227 --> 03:47.960
Mm-hmm.

03:47.962 --> 03:49.628
Something else?

03:51.232 --> 03:53.265
Come, sit.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.334
Um...

03:57.438 --> 04:00.372
I'd really like another chance
to question Carl Brown.

04:01.942 --> 04:05.510
Do you think he's going to
treat you differently today?

04:06.614 --> 04:08.614
Probably not.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.415
But I'm not ready to give up.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.851
Hetty, even with him
in prison,

04:12.853 --> 04:14.720
the internal threats
keep coming.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.321
They know where we live.

04:16.323 --> 04:19.324
They know who
our families are.

04:19.326 --> 04:22.427
We really don't have
another choice.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.297
And...

04:26.634 --> 04:28.700
I have a plan.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.570
Uh-huh.

04:32.940 --> 04:36.575
You've got no idea who
the guardian angel might be

04:36.577 --> 04:38.477
who killed our
phony sheriffs?

04:38.479 --> 04:40.679
No. Keep thinking.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.349
And you're sure
your fath--

04:44.351 --> 04:46.752
sorry-- Garrison is
actually in Santa Barbara?

04:46.754 --> 04:48.587
If Garrison had done this,
there wouldn't be any bodies.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.355
Thank you.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.425
All right, well,
maybe he just wants

04:53.427 --> 04:54.760
to spend the time
he has left

04:54.762 --> 04:55.894
being part of your lives.

04:55.896 --> 04:58.497
It's his first time
finding family, too.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.599
He's had other families.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.634
But now all he has is you,

05:02.636 --> 05:04.536
your half sister,
and your nephew.

05:04.538 --> 05:07.472
You have told Alex?

05:07.474 --> 05:09.741
I will.
I want to.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.044
I just...
I don't want to...

05:12.046 --> 05:14.980
But you're thinking twice,
especially after this morning.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.449
Like father, like son, maybe.

05:18.385 --> 05:19.785
What's that supposed to mean?

05:19.787 --> 05:22.054
Keeping family secrets
to protect your loved ones.

05:22.056 --> 05:24.022
That's pretty much what
your dad did to you

05:24.024 --> 05:26.625
and everyone else
in his life.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.067
CALLEN:
Huh.

05:35.069 --> 05:38.637
This just keeps getting better.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.405
Strategic location.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.409
I don't see
any cameras.

05:44.411 --> 05:47.546
No, whoever did this
was a pro.

05:47.548 --> 05:48.613
Stay close, partner.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.963
DEEKS:
So, just to clarify,

06:04.965 --> 06:07.032
this woman kills
two fake sheriffs

06:07.034 --> 06:09.735
in your front yard, steals
their stolen cop car,

06:09.737 --> 06:10.936
and then torches it?

06:10.938 --> 06:12.804
Yeah, I think it's
pretty obvious

06:12.806 --> 06:14.139
who we're looking for.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.607
Do tell.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.743
I mean, this whole
situation just reeks

06:17.745 --> 06:19.778
of an angry ex-girlfriend.

06:19.779 --> 06:21.812
So Joelle is pissed
that you broke up with her,

06:21.815 --> 06:23.548
and now she's taking
keying your car

06:23.550 --> 06:25.016
to a whole nother level.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.685
Are you serious right now?

06:26.687 --> 06:28.153
You did keep her
dining room set.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.889
She bought that for me.
That was a gift.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.090
No, for the both of you,
but now it's just

06:32.092 --> 06:34.059
a painful reminder
of what could have been.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.427
(chuckles)

06:35.429 --> 06:36.495
Why are you playing
along with this?

06:36.497 --> 06:38.463
I'm just glad
you're okay.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.933
Morning, gents.
Without further ado...

06:41.935 --> 06:44.169
Both of our phony sheriffs
had surveillance photos

06:44.171 --> 06:46.605
of this woman
in their phones.

06:46.607 --> 06:47.773
Is this our shooter?

06:47.775 --> 06:49.441
Confidence is high.

06:49.443 --> 06:50.842
I don't recognize her.

06:50.844 --> 06:51.843
Me either.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.112
Check out your
home-security video.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.715
What's that look like to you?

06:56.717 --> 06:58.683
Looks like she's going
to your front door.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.685
Maybe she was trying
to warn you.

07:00.687 --> 07:01.987
So why not just call me?

07:01.989 --> 07:03.422
No access to
your phone number?

07:03.424 --> 07:05.090
(phone chimes)

07:05.092 --> 07:06.992
Everything good?

07:06.994 --> 07:09.995
My neighbor thinks she may
have seen something last night.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.096
I'll go talk to her.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.831
We'll double-check
the crime scene.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.902
Well, looks like it's just
me and you again, Egon.

07:16.904 --> 07:20.205
You know, if, uh, you want
to be home with Kensi,

07:20.207 --> 07:21.606
I can just call you
if anything comes up.

07:21.608 --> 07:25.577
No, no, no, because
both my mom

07:25.579 --> 07:27.078
and Kensi's mom are
coming to visit.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.816
And it turns out that's
just too many moms.

07:32.152 --> 07:35.587
Hi. How was your run?

07:35.589 --> 07:36.888
It was great.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.757
I made you
some breakfast.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.125
Aw, you didn't have
to do that.

07:40.127 --> 07:43.462
Gotta keep your
strength up, honey.

07:43.464 --> 07:46.198
Okay, let me just help
you with this, honey.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.766
Oh, whoa, definitely
don't have to do that.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.268
It's no problem.
Thank you.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.769
I picked out a couple
outfits for you.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.471
I'll help you get changed
when you're done.

07:52.473 --> 07:53.906
Okay, you know that?
Can we just...

07:53.907 --> 07:55.340
Can we just stop
for a second, please?

07:55.341 --> 07:56.774
What's wrong?
What do you need?

07:56.777 --> 07:57.876
I don't need anything,
I just...

07:57.878 --> 07:59.911
I need you ladies
to leave me alone

07:59.913 --> 08:01.079
for a second, okay?

08:01.081 --> 08:02.581
We're just trying
to help, sweetheart.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.882
No, I know.
I mean,

08:03.884 --> 08:05.317
that's the only reason
we're here, honey.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.751
And I appreciate that.
I-I really do.

08:06.753 --> 08:09.788
But, um, you're kind of
driving me nuts.

08:12.059 --> 08:13.758
Would you prefer
we do this one-on-one?

08:13.760 --> 08:16.528
No, Mom, I would prefer
if we did this none-on-one.

08:16.530 --> 08:17.762
And, plus, I'm supposed
to be able

08:17.764 --> 08:19.598
to do these things
by myself, so...
You are.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.566
And you're
doing great.

08:21.568 --> 08:22.801
Really doing great.
Okay,

08:22.803 --> 08:24.453
stop telling me I'm doing great.

08:24.454 --> 08:26.104
I am not ten, I know
exactly how I'm doing.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.341
She's getting
frustrated.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.775
The doctor said
there'd be depression.

08:30.777 --> 08:33.578
Okay, stop talking,
both of you,<i> please.</i>

08:34.748 --> 08:36.498
Maybe we should
call Martin.

08:36.499 --> 08:38.249
Would you like us
to call Martin?
No. Nope, not at all.

08:38.252 --> 08:39.584
You really don't have
to call Deeks.

08:39.586 --> 08:40.752
I'm calling my son.
Oh, my gosh.

08:45.526 --> 08:48.760
Okay, you know what?

08:48.762 --> 08:49.895
I have something
you can both do.

08:51.765 --> 08:55.634
You ladies have the day off.
Good-bye.

08:56.603 --> 08:58.203
(sighs)

08:58.205 --> 08:59.905
I am so embarrassed.

08:59.906 --> 09:01.606
Oh, don't be.
Mine's just as bad.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.942
Is it too early
for a drink?

09:03.944 --> 09:05.677
I like the way
you think.

09:05.679 --> 09:08.313
You're a good mom.
I can tell.
You, too.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.981
Let's go.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.756
(sighs)

09:20.761 --> 09:22.193
(knock on door)

09:22.195 --> 09:25.196
Okay, I swear I'm gonna
get my gun!

09:25.198 --> 09:26.665
What?!

09:26.667 --> 09:28.099
Why don't you just...

09:28.101 --> 09:30.835
So... it's a bad time?

09:30.837 --> 09:34.339
Sorry, I thought you were
my mother.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.708
Never mind.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.076
I would have
brought you flowers,

09:38.078 --> 09:40.579
but you didn't seem
like the type.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.914
(exhales)

09:42.916 --> 09:44.616
Come on in.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.318
Thank you.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.355
(indistinct chatter in distance)

09:51.658 --> 09:53.658
NELL: Okay, let's start
from the beginning.

09:53.660 --> 09:55.994
So where'd you first meet?

09:57.297 --> 10:00.131
Where'd you go?
What'd you do?

10:00.133 --> 10:01.900
Come on, Carl, you gotta
give me something here.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.234
Why?

10:03.236 --> 10:05.337
What are you gonna give me?

10:05.339 --> 10:06.705
What do you want?

10:06.707 --> 10:08.139
Out.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.208
Right.

10:12.713 --> 10:16.014
Look, Sam's been interrogating
people for a long time...

10:16.016 --> 10:17.816
and I haven't.

10:19.653 --> 10:22.354
So I'm gonna
tell you a story.

10:28.762 --> 10:32.897
The summer after I graduated
from high school,

10:32.899 --> 10:36.234
I started going out
with this guy who...

10:36.236 --> 10:37.936
most people would call...

10:37.938 --> 10:39.304
a "bad boy."

10:39.306 --> 10:41.139
Tattoos, piercings,

10:41.141 --> 10:44.342
he drove this
ridiculously loud car.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.177
But he was actually...

10:46.179 --> 10:48.880
he was really sweet.
(chuckles)

10:48.882 --> 10:51.216
Especially to me.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.568
So,

10:53.569 --> 10:55.919
when he started hanging out
with this rougher crowd,

10:55.922 --> 10:58.323
I naturally asked him not to.

10:58.325 --> 11:02.394
Asked him to spend
more time with me.

11:02.396 --> 11:03.695
But...

11:03.697 --> 11:05.196
he didn't listen.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.798
Oh, boohoo.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.700
He broke your heart.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.770
Happens to everyone.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.722
No.

11:13.723 --> 11:15.673
He, uh, he broke
into an electronics store

11:15.676 --> 11:17.976
and stole a pallet
of DVD players.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.045
So, at the end
of the summer,

11:20.047 --> 11:23.715
he went to county
and I went to college.

11:23.717 --> 11:27.919
Wait, are you saying
that crime doesn't pay?

11:27.921 --> 11:30.321
I wrote him every day

11:30.323 --> 11:33.758
for, it felt
like weeks.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.428
Then he stopped
writing me back.

11:36.430 --> 11:39.330
Please tell me there's a moral
to all this.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.733
I was young.

11:45.706 --> 11:48.039
I thought I could help him,

11:48.041 --> 11:49.874
save him,

11:49.876 --> 11:52.110
but I couldn't.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.348
I never saw him again
after he went into jail.

12:00.387 --> 12:04.889
Maybe he's in here with me.
(laughs)

12:04.891 --> 12:07.826
Wouldn't that be
an ironic twist?

12:07.828 --> 12:09.127
Oh, wait.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.262
I didn't just spoil your
M. Night Shyamalan moment,

12:11.264 --> 12:12.731
did I?

12:12.733 --> 12:14.132
No.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.000
(sighs)
He's not in here, Carl.

12:16.002 --> 12:17.135
Darn.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.521
See, like yourself,

12:19.522 --> 12:21.906
he thought he was smarter
and tougher than everyone else.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.075
Until a group
of inmates

12:24.077 --> 12:27.445
took turns stomping on his head
until they crushed his skull.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.052
I guess he wasn't so tough
after all.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.487
No, he was.

12:36.490 --> 12:40.458
He was a lot tougher
than you, Carl.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.028
You may be in solitary,

12:44.030 --> 12:46.097
but there's still a price
on your head.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.167
It's just so nice to be wanted.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.502
You know?

12:50.504 --> 12:53.171
Honestly, how long do you think
it's gonna be

12:53.173 --> 12:55.507
before some inmate
and crooked guard

12:55.509 --> 12:57.542
make a deal and split the cash?

12:57.544 --> 12:58.943
Huh?

13:00.781 --> 13:03.114
Yeah, as much as
I love your company

13:03.116 --> 13:04.415
and your stories...

13:06.186 --> 13:08.820
...unless these turn
into conjugal visits...

13:08.822 --> 13:10.221
Oh, that's cute, Carl.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.957
...I got nothing left
to tell you.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.261
Mm-hmm. I know that.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.930
Yet you keep coming.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.865
(laughing)

13:20.867 --> 13:23.234
It's kind of sad.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.274
(humming)

13:36.349 --> 13:37.715
Dude.

13:37.716 --> 13:39.082
(smacks lips)
You've been over here humming

13:39.085 --> 13:40.351
for the last ten minutes.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.452
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.954
I didn't even ask
you to harmonize.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.089
¶ I'm here, you're here ¶

13:45.091 --> 13:46.124
(high-pitched):
¶ I'm here... ¶

13:46.126 --> 13:47.392
That's a hard pass.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.127
You're trying to make me
sing the Garfunkel parts

13:49.129 --> 13:50.361
and I'm obviously a Simon.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.896
All right, Paul, take a seat.

13:51.898 --> 13:53.331
Your lurking's
making me nervous.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.567
(computer beeps)

13:55.569 --> 13:57.836
What just happened?
We get something?

13:57.838 --> 14:00.104
Uh, no. Just my hourly
reminder to stand up.

14:00.106 --> 14:02.507
To evil?
No.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.142
So my feet don't
fall asleep.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.614
(sputtering)

14:09.616 --> 14:13.017
I don't understand...

14:13.019 --> 14:14.419
this.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.120
Oh, you don't have to.

14:16.122 --> 14:17.856
That's why I have Nell.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.225
Touché.

14:21.895 --> 14:25.096
(chuckling)

14:25.098 --> 14:28.099
Do I even want to know?

14:28.101 --> 14:29.601
I'm just wondering
how you're gonna

14:29.603 --> 14:31.870
try and get me
to talk next time.

14:31.872 --> 14:34.305
Well, Carl,

14:34.307 --> 14:35.940
today's my last visit.

14:35.942 --> 14:38.543
And to be honest,

14:38.545 --> 14:41.246
I never really
needed you to talk.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.550
You see,

14:45.552 --> 14:47.485
every time
I come here,

14:47.487 --> 14:51.022
word gets out that Carl Brown's
meeting with a federal agent.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.157
Again.

14:53.159 --> 14:54.325
Inmates--

14:54.327 --> 14:56.227
they start to wonder,

14:56.229 --> 14:58.563
"What's he telling her?

14:58.565 --> 15:00.965
Who's he ratting out?"

15:00.967 --> 15:03.902
Visit after visit.

15:03.904 --> 15:06.204
"Ooh, that Carl.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.606
"He must be a real
Chatty Cathy,

15:08.608 --> 15:11.576
or they wouldn't keep
coming here to see him."

15:11.578 --> 15:14.946
The inmates start
to get nervous,

15:14.948 --> 15:18.216
especially after we start
rattling their cages.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.318
And so,

15:20.320 --> 15:21.920
what do they do?

15:21.922 --> 15:23.554
Well,

15:23.556 --> 15:25.924
you know what
they say:

15:25.926 --> 15:28.459
"Snitches get stitches.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.395
And turned into bitches."

15:31.364 --> 15:32.597
Everyone will
want you dead

15:32.599 --> 15:34.565
regardless of the
$50K on your head.

15:37.103 --> 15:40.204
And the next time someone
comes to see you,

15:40.206 --> 15:42.307
chances are,

15:42.309 --> 15:43.541
you'll be willing to talk,

15:43.543 --> 15:45.944
from the infirmary.

15:45.946 --> 15:47.979
Assuming...

15:47.981 --> 15:50.682
they haven't cut out your tongue
with a razor blade.

15:50.684 --> 15:53.985
Yeah, they do that, too.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.156
Maybe Natalie

15:58.158 --> 16:00.692
never called me
or wrote me

16:00.694 --> 16:02.961
since I got put in here

16:02.963 --> 16:04.362
because she's dead.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.731
Maybe someone

16:06.733 --> 16:08.633
was after her and killed her

16:08.635 --> 16:10.735
as soon as I was
out of the picture.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.404
So, what, someone else
put the hit out on you?

16:13.406 --> 16:15.073
I don't know.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.575
Natalie never told me
who she was working for.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.316
Why should I believe you?

16:25.318 --> 16:27.051
'Cause I gave you her name.

16:27.053 --> 16:28.052
No,

16:28.054 --> 16:30.321
you gave Sam her name.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.523
I'm not Sam.

16:32.525 --> 16:35.059
(sighs)

16:36.730 --> 16:39.564
I met Natalie at the Promenade.

16:39.566 --> 16:42.700
Some dive bar.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.336
Then the next day,

16:45.338 --> 16:46.404
we went to the pier.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.087
NELL:
That's all I have so far.

17:03.089 --> 17:04.756
Oh, I can definitely
work with that.

17:04.758 --> 17:07.058
Nell, you rock, seriously.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.426
DEEKS:
Uh, is that a lead?

17:08.428 --> 17:10.128
'Cause it sounded a lot
like a lead.
Oh,

17:10.130 --> 17:11.562
well, Nell says that Brown
first met Natalie

17:11.564 --> 17:13.364
at a dive bar
near the Promenade.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.766
Mm.
And then the next day,

17:14.768 --> 17:15.800
they went to the
Santa Monica Pier.

17:15.802 --> 17:16.801
Which bar?

17:16.803 --> 17:18.937
Oh, he won't say,

17:18.938 --> 17:21.072
but apparently he bought
tacos at a nearby food truck

17:21.074 --> 17:22.540
later that night. So,

17:22.542 --> 17:25.777
of all the popular
taco trucks...

17:25.779 --> 17:28.179
Tita and Chilias,
uh, Navarette's,

17:28.181 --> 17:30.148
uh, oh, Pepe
and Mondo's.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.249
A lot of these trucks have

17:31.251 --> 17:32.267
social media accounts that

17:32.268 --> 17:33.284
announce their
serving locations.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.452
So we can tell
where they've been.

17:34.454 --> 17:35.904
You are correct, sir.

17:35.905 --> 17:37.355
Thank you, sir.
We just need to know when.

17:37.357 --> 17:38.756
Right. Well, we
captured Brown

17:38.758 --> 17:40.224
two years ago,
November 24.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.493
Wow, you were ready to go
with that one. Although

17:42.495 --> 17:44.162
he did hold you
at gunpoint.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.130
Gunpoint and
syringe-point.

17:46.132 --> 17:47.665
Yikes.
(clears throat)

17:47.667 --> 17:48.566
Anyway,

17:48.568 --> 17:49.801
Natalie had to turn Brown,

17:49.803 --> 17:51.602
Brown leaked Hetty's info,

17:51.604 --> 17:52.603
poisoned Granger--

17:52.605 --> 17:54.505
that takes us back
a few months.

17:54.507 --> 17:55.673
Like, June?
(chair hisses)

17:55.674 --> 17:56.840
Hey, what are
you doing?
(chair hisses)

17:56.843 --> 17:58.342
Relax, I'll put it
back to Nell level

17:58.344 --> 17:59.343
when I'm done.

17:59.345 --> 18:00.611
(sighing):
All right,

18:00.613 --> 18:01.612
these are the taco trucks

18:01.614 --> 18:02.613
that serve in Santa Monica.

18:02.615 --> 18:03.614
DEEKS:
All right, I feel like

18:03.616 --> 18:04.615
we're gonna find something here.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.250
Ready, no whammies, no whammies.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.485
Stop!

18:07.487 --> 18:09.821
Pepe and Mondo's
slung their tacos

18:09.823 --> 18:12.557
on Santa Monica Boulevard
outside the Sunset Ocean Bar.

18:12.559 --> 18:13.858
Which is on the Promenade!

18:13.860 --> 18:15.593
(both imitate explosion)

18:15.595 --> 18:17.562
And I just exploded
my fist bump,

18:17.564 --> 18:19.297
which is a whole
new low for me.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.732
So now we're into this rabbit
hole of despair, what's next?

18:21.734 --> 18:23.601
Now we just wait
for facial rec

18:23.603 --> 18:25.603
to pull up photos from the bar.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.638
Wait? What?

18:27.640 --> 18:30.308
There's no other leads
for us to follow?
Hmm?

18:30.310 --> 18:31.776
No, not yet. Well,

18:31.778 --> 18:33.311
I'll pull up some photos

18:33.313 --> 18:35.213
from the Santa Monica Pier
the next day,

18:35.215 --> 18:37.248
but it might take a while.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.749
Welcome to Ops.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.852
Okay, so we've got all this
<i> Star Trek</i> gak

18:40.854 --> 18:42.186
and your giant brain,
you're telling me

18:42.188 --> 18:43.454
all we can do is wait?

18:43.456 --> 18:44.355
Yeah.
No.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.756
All right, hey, Siri,

18:45.758 --> 18:48.593
can you tell me
where Natalie is? Alexa?

18:48.595 --> 18:50.261
Cortana?

18:50.263 --> 18:52.196
HAL?

18:52.198 --> 18:53.664
Bueller? Anyone?

18:53.666 --> 18:55.333
We don't have an AI.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.467
Well, we should.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.819
Beale, take a letter.

18:57.820 --> 18:59.170
"Dear Henrietta, it has
come to my attention..."

18:59.172 --> 19:00.171
Um,

19:00.173 --> 19:01.656
I'm not your secretary.

19:01.657 --> 19:03.140
Nor would you have
to be if we had AI.

19:03.143 --> 19:04.408
Hmm.
(computer chirps)

19:04.410 --> 19:05.993
What now?

19:05.994 --> 19:07.577
More wiggling? Huh?
You want to do some Pilates?

19:07.580 --> 19:09.814
(sighs) The guys
posing as our sheriffs

19:09.816 --> 19:13.151
are one Perry Verona
and one Dexter Frazier,

19:13.153 --> 19:15.219
owners of VexSun Solar
in Culver City.

19:15.221 --> 19:16.487
Okay, I would
take you with me,

19:16.489 --> 19:17.889
but you seem to have
a lot going on here,

19:17.891 --> 19:19.524
so I'm gonna go.
Hey. Bup-bup-
bup-bup-bup.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.292
(grunts)

19:21.294 --> 19:22.660
DEEKS:
As promised. Okay.
(chair hisses)

19:22.662 --> 19:24.629
Address is on the way.

19:24.631 --> 19:25.796
I am calling
Callen and Sam.

19:25.798 --> 19:26.898
Beale?
Mm?

19:28.168 --> 19:29.500
You're good people.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.872
(sighs)

19:34.874 --> 19:35.873
(Eric speaking indistinctly
over phone)

19:35.875 --> 19:37.341
Okay.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.626
Tell Deeks we'll
meet him there.

19:38.627 --> 19:39.910
All right, he's on his way now.
Right.

19:39.913 --> 19:41.379
Okay, let me know what you find.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.347
All right, Eric. Bye.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.384
So, uh, Deeks is
gonna meet us

19:46.386 --> 19:47.919
at some solar
roof company

19:47.921 --> 19:49.654
where the two phony
sheriffs worked.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.455
A solar company?
That sounds bogus.

19:51.457 --> 19:53.224
You think?
Here.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.926
I promised Mrs. Ramirez
I would share these with you.

19:54.928 --> 19:56.678
(laughs)

19:56.679 --> 19:58.429
I'm sorry, we had to
chase down that lead.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.264
What if she actually
saw something?

20:00.266 --> 20:01.799
That poor woman hasn't
seen anything clearly

20:01.801 --> 20:03.201
since Reagan
was president.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.570
Shh. She still thinks he is.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.443
So, uh,

20:12.445 --> 20:14.028
looks like you're gonna
have to move, too,

20:14.029 --> 20:15.612
now that your address
has been compromised.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.515
Yeah.
(sighs)

20:17.517 --> 20:19.750
I know.

20:19.752 --> 20:23.287
Do I detect a sense of nostalgia
in the High Plains Drifter?

20:23.289 --> 20:24.922
Don't tell me
you actually

20:24.924 --> 20:26.657
settled on one place?

20:26.659 --> 20:28.559
Of course not. No,

20:28.560 --> 20:30.460
I'm just thinking about
how Mrs. Ramirez might feel.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.463
Right.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.765
Seriously?
It's four walls and a roof.

20:34.767 --> 20:35.900
I can find that anywhere.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.435
Oh, please.
You've been domesticated.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.436
I knew it.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.271
I knew it.
It was over

20:40.273 --> 20:41.839
as soon as Joelle got you
that dining room set.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.774
Enough with the dining set.

20:43.776 --> 20:45.543
Thing's going on Craigslist.

20:45.545 --> 20:46.611
Sure it is.

20:46.613 --> 20:47.912
Puttin'
it up.
Yeah, right.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.714
(chuckles)

20:49.716 --> 20:50.948
Thank you!

21:00.627 --> 21:02.593
(car door opens)
Neighbor
see anything?

21:02.595 --> 21:05.263
(chuckles)
Please.

21:05.265 --> 21:06.797
His neighbor's glasses
are thicker than my head.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.933
Mrs. Ramirez was scared.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.601
She just wanted
someone to talk to.

21:10.603 --> 21:11.769
Aw, that's sweet.

21:11.771 --> 21:12.970
She's sweet, all right.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.538
Sweet on G.

21:14.540 --> 21:15.606
Oh, older woman.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.008
Hey, Mrs. Robinson.

21:17.010 --> 21:19.610
Mrs. Ramirez is
a very sweet old lady.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.712
Please do not say anything
sexually perverted

21:21.714 --> 21:23.164
or crude, all right?

21:23.165 --> 21:24.615
You're not leaving me
a lot to work with, here.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.883
Why is he so grumpy?

21:25.885 --> 21:27.418
You'd be grumpy, too,

21:27.420 --> 21:28.886
if your ex left two bodies
on your lawn.

21:28.888 --> 21:32.323
I'll be really pleased
when Kensi gets back.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.627
(whistles) Not seeing a
lot of solar companies

21:36.629 --> 21:38.896
on here, but in case
you need to get

21:38.898 --> 21:40.531
your fax machine repaired,

21:40.533 --> 21:42.900
or we could stop by
the Nader campaign offices.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.769
That list needs updating.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.637
We're looking for VexSun Solar.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.738
Uh, it's upstairs.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.540
I can show you.

21:49.542 --> 21:50.808
You guys contractors?

21:50.810 --> 21:52.510
Federal agents.

21:52.512 --> 21:53.778
You have any security
footage we can look at?

21:53.780 --> 21:55.630
Uh, no.

21:55.631 --> 21:57.481
Our video surveillance
has been down for...

21:57.483 --> 21:59.784
I don't think this building's
ever had video surveillance.

21:59.786 --> 22:00.818
So are you guys FBI?

22:00.820 --> 22:02.653
Or NSA? SEC?

22:02.655 --> 22:04.655
NCIS.

22:04.657 --> 22:05.956
What about IDs?

22:05.958 --> 22:08.392
Got any electronic records
of people coming or going?

22:08.394 --> 22:09.660
Uh, no.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.029
We haven't had that
system installed yet.

22:12.031 --> 22:15.966
Uh, I'm actually thinking
about becoming a federal agent.

22:15.968 --> 22:19.103
Uh, yeah, all I ever do is
watch those true crime shows,

22:19.105 --> 22:21.972
and I'm perfect
for undercover work.

22:21.974 --> 22:24.775
I'm basically a chameleon.

22:26.112 --> 22:27.111
It's just
this way.

22:27.113 --> 22:28.946
Wow.

22:28.947 --> 22:30.780
Law enforcement is
definitely for me.

22:30.783 --> 22:32.416
I was leaning towards FBI,

22:32.418 --> 22:35.586
but, you know,
maybe LAPD or NCIS.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.822
I'm really keeping my options
open at this point.

22:37.824 --> 22:38.956
Deeks is LAPD.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.624
He's done a lot
of undercover work.

22:40.626 --> 22:41.959
You might want
to talk to him.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.461
Mm-hmm. Door?

22:43.463 --> 22:45.429
Okay.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.709
Looks like a bogus front to me.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.544
When's the last time
you saw anybody in here?

23:00.546 --> 23:01.979
Uh, yesterday afternoon.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.948
I had no idea
they were moving out.

23:03.950 --> 23:05.850
These men work here?

23:05.852 --> 23:06.917
Yeah, both of 'em.

23:23.803 --> 23:24.935
You going to answer that?

23:24.937 --> 23:26.470
Well, it's a number
I don't know.

23:26.472 --> 23:28.038
I've been getting
a lot of crank calls lately.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.541
Could be a hot tip.

23:30.543 --> 23:31.542
Hello.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.110
Vinny?

23:33.112 --> 23:34.678
How'd you get this number?
(laughs)

23:34.680 --> 23:35.980
From my what?
From my business card?

23:35.982 --> 23:38.266
All right,
I gotta call you back.

23:38.267 --> 23:40.551
Did you give Vinny the security
guy my business card?

23:40.553 --> 23:42.686
I-I mean, he wants to get
into law enforcement.

23:42.688 --> 23:43.954
You'd be a good mentor.

23:43.956 --> 23:46.090
Where'd you even get
my business cards?

23:46.092 --> 23:48.692
Got a whole box of 'em
on your desk.

23:48.694 --> 23:50.428
Well, at least you<i> had </i>
a box on your desk...

23:50.430 --> 23:52.696
This is why I'm getting
all those prank phone calls.

23:52.698 --> 23:54.565
Deeks,
look at it from

23:54.567 --> 23:55.866
a community safety
point of view.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.568
Now the entire homeless
population of Venice

23:57.570 --> 23:58.969
has a direct line to the LAPD.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.971
Hold on a second. You gave them
to homeless people?

24:00.973 --> 24:02.773
Yes.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.574
I thought we were picking
on him today.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.710
I don't play
favorites.
ERIC: Hey.

24:06.712 --> 24:07.945
Sorry for sending you guys
on a wild goose chase.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.113
Well, they
were there,

24:09.115 --> 24:10.981
we just didn't get
there early enough.

24:10.983 --> 24:12.450
You find anything else?

24:12.452 --> 24:13.717
Maybe.

24:13.719 --> 24:14.718
Our phony sheriffs

24:14.720 --> 24:16.454
and solar roofing guys

24:16.456 --> 24:17.755
are both former military--

24:17.757 --> 24:19.790
army-- although they never
served together.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.725
What'd they do after service?

24:21.727 --> 24:23.761
Uh, truck drivers... in Iraq.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.629
Mmm, I smell
private contractors.

24:25.631 --> 24:26.864
You got a company?

24:26.866 --> 24:28.466
Uh, maybe. Ashmati Trucking.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.468
Eight years ago, the owner died

24:30.470 --> 24:32.470
and then there was an ugly
inheritance battle

24:32.472 --> 24:34.055
between the survivors,

24:34.056 --> 24:35.639
which ultimately
killed the company.

24:35.641 --> 24:37.141
It happens.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.709
Well, these were private
contractors working in Iraq,

24:38.711 --> 24:40.361
making a lot of money.

24:40.362 --> 24:42.012
Just because the company
they worked for went belly-up,

24:42.014 --> 24:43.481
that doesn't mean they're
not still doing it.

24:43.483 --> 24:44.882
DEEKS:
Which takes us back
to the question,

24:44.884 --> 24:46.150
who were these guys working for

24:46.152 --> 24:47.518
and why did this woman
kill them?

24:47.520 --> 24:49.119
Which is exactly how
we started this day.

24:49.121 --> 24:51.088
Well, Deeks' new buddy, Vinny,

24:51.090 --> 24:53.757
said there were six people
working out of VexSun Solar.

24:53.759 --> 24:55.526
Two women, four men.

24:55.528 --> 24:57.528
So we've got these two.

24:57.530 --> 24:58.562
The rest are still
out there somewhere.

24:58.564 --> 24:59.630
I'm on it.

25:06.539 --> 25:08.506
Hetty...

25:08.508 --> 25:11.775
The wolves are at the door.

25:11.777 --> 25:13.177
I can feel it.

25:15.715 --> 25:20.117
I'm not sure it's safe
to trust anyone anymore.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.891
I just wanted to come by
and say thank you.

25:26.893 --> 25:28.259
Thank you for what?

25:28.261 --> 25:30.294
Making my time in
the hospital bearable.

25:30.296 --> 25:32.630
Oh. Well.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.765
In that case, I suppose
I should thank you, too.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.534
I was in a bad place

25:36.536 --> 25:37.868
and you helped
pull me out of it.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.570
Well, you were an ass
about it, but...
(chuckles)

25:39.572 --> 25:40.704
Well, that's a gift.

25:40.706 --> 25:41.839
(both laugh)

25:41.841 --> 25:43.974
I just also
wanted to say...

25:43.976 --> 25:46.277
good-bye
before I left.

25:46.279 --> 25:47.578
Where you going?

25:47.580 --> 25:49.046
Back to my unit.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.814
Medical Board
restored me to duty status.

25:50.816 --> 25:52.149
What?!
Yeah, yeah.

25:52.151 --> 25:53.617
That is awesome!

25:53.619 --> 25:54.818
Been sitting on my ass
long enough.

25:54.820 --> 25:57.054
And the guys are gonna
ride me relentlessly

25:57.056 --> 25:59.323
and the one-legged jokes
will never end,

25:59.324 --> 26:01.591
but it'll be good
to get back with my guys.

26:01.594 --> 26:02.626
Congratulations.
Yeah.

26:02.628 --> 26:03.894
I'm...

26:03.896 --> 26:05.696
(Kensi chuckles)

26:05.698 --> 26:06.830
Is this your truck?
Yeah.

26:06.832 --> 26:07.948
You're impressed.

26:07.949 --> 26:09.065
I'm... more like
embarrassed for you.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.100
It's very
obnoxious.

26:10.102 --> 26:11.836
Oh, you can't fool me,
Kensi Blye.

26:11.837 --> 26:13.571
I know a redneck girl
when I see one.

26:13.573 --> 26:14.738
Okay, I am not
a redneck.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.173
(laughs)

26:16.175 --> 26:17.708
Well, you'll like
this bad boy.

26:17.710 --> 26:19.710
You know what they say,
the bigger the truck...

26:19.712 --> 26:21.946
The dumber the driver?
(laughs)

26:21.948 --> 26:25.249
Well, I know you want
to go for a ride.

26:28.154 --> 26:31.922
¶ I'm very well acquainted, too,
with matters mathematical ¶

26:31.924 --> 26:34.625
¶ I understand equations, both
the simple and quadratical ¶

26:34.627 --> 26:38.862
¶ About binomial theorem I'm
teeming with a lot of news ¶

26:38.864 --> 26:41.899
¶ With many cheerful facts about
the square of the hypotenuse ¶

26:41.901 --> 26:45.269
¶ I'm very good at integral
and differential calculus ¶

26:45.271 --> 26:47.638
¶ I know the scientific names
of beings animalculous ¶

26:47.640 --> 26:49.240
¶ In short, in matters ¶

26:49.241 --> 26:50.841
¶ Vegetable, animal and mineral,
I am the... ¶

26:50.843 --> 26:53.944
Holy Pythagoras.

26:57.316 --> 26:58.816
So... did she ever

26:58.818 --> 27:01.018
introduce you
to her friends?

27:01.020 --> 27:03.153
No. I told you.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.322
(sighs)

27:05.324 --> 27:06.957
Look, I'm tired

27:06.959 --> 27:08.726
and my back hurts.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.794
I want to go back
to my cell now.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.830
You should probably try
straightening up.

27:12.832 --> 27:14.098
You know,
shoulders back...

27:14.100 --> 27:16.667
(phone chimes)
...and down.

27:16.669 --> 27:18.302
You know?

27:18.304 --> 27:19.903
Suit yourself.

27:19.905 --> 27:22.006
(clears throat)

27:23.843 --> 27:25.042
Nah.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.012
Oh, wow.

27:30.716 --> 27:32.650
Is this Natalie Grant?

27:38.391 --> 27:39.923
Hmm.

27:39.925 --> 27:40.924
ERIC:
<i> I found her.</i>

27:40.926 --> 27:42.426
I know who she is.

27:42.428 --> 27:43.994
The woman from outside my house?
ERIC: Yes.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.796
It was Natalie Grant.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.665
Carl Brown
just confirmed to Nell

27:47.667 --> 27:50.334
that she's the woman
in the taxi photo.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.036
Also the same woman who shot
the phony sheriffs.

27:52.038 --> 27:54.005
She also goes by Amber Wilcox--

27:54.006 --> 27:55.973
a massage therapist
from Houston, Texas.

27:55.975 --> 27:58.909
Uh, I can only trace her
back 12 years.

27:58.911 --> 28:00.177
That's a good cover.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.211
It allows her to move around,

28:01.213 --> 28:03.213
cash business,
no real address.

28:03.215 --> 28:04.748
Smart.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.316
She's on the run now.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.052
But if she was coming
to kill Callen,

28:08.054 --> 28:09.687
who are the two dead
sheriff wannabes

28:09.689 --> 28:10.821
that tried to stop her?

28:10.823 --> 28:12.923
What if she wasn't
sent to kill me?

28:14.326 --> 28:16.060
What if she was turning
to me for help?

28:16.062 --> 28:17.361
Think about it.

28:17.363 --> 28:19.163
She's Carl Brown's handler.

28:19.165 --> 28:21.732
She talks him into
trying to kill us,

28:21.734 --> 28:23.000
but we catch him,
put him in jail.

28:23.001 --> 28:24.267
So then they try and
kill him in prison;

28:24.270 --> 28:26.804
we beat 'em to it
and put him in isolation.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.038
Now he's talking.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.840
So now they're going after her.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.875
It's not like she can
go to the police.

28:31.877 --> 28:34.044
Which means she's in
a pretty bad situation,

28:34.046 --> 28:36.447
if she's turning to the very
people she tried to kill.

28:36.449 --> 28:37.915
Well, she knows
she's running out of time

28:37.916 --> 28:39.382
and we're probably the only ones
that can save her.

28:39.385 --> 28:43.353
Well, if Amber/Natalie
turned Brown,

28:43.355 --> 28:44.488
she probably knew
where he worked.

28:44.490 --> 28:45.789
Why wouldn't she just come here?

28:45.791 --> 28:47.057
If she knows where we work,

28:47.058 --> 28:48.324
the people she works for
know where we work.

28:48.327 --> 28:49.793
They're probably
watching us now.

28:49.795 --> 28:51.862
It's too risky.
Yikes.

28:51.864 --> 28:53.130
Well, by now
she's probably out of town

28:53.132 --> 28:55.132
or at least gone into hiding.

28:55.134 --> 28:56.200
SAM:
For all we know,
she's working with

28:56.202 --> 28:57.468
the same people
who tried to kill her.

28:57.470 --> 28:58.902
If that's the case,

28:58.904 --> 29:00.337
all her hiding spots are blown.

29:00.339 --> 29:01.872
Okay, so what
do we got?

29:01.874 --> 29:03.941
We got family,
friends, boyfriends.

29:03.943 --> 29:06.210
Mm-hmm.

29:06.211 --> 29:08.478
I mean, Carl Brown
was her boyfriend.

29:08.481 --> 29:10.981
ERIC:
Hey, what if she's at
Carl Brown's house?

29:10.983 --> 29:14.051
The file says
that he inherited it

29:14.053 --> 29:15.486
from his aunt three years ago.

29:15.488 --> 29:17.287
The feds seized it
when he went to jail.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.022
And Natalie would have a key.

29:19.024 --> 29:20.224
Not that she needs one.

29:20.226 --> 29:22.092
My God, man!
You're better than Siri!

29:22.094 --> 29:23.393
Thank you.

29:23.395 --> 29:24.528
I'm coming with you.

29:24.530 --> 29:25.829
Why?

29:25.831 --> 29:28.065
Because my career depends on it.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.235
Deeks, take Hetty
in the Audi.

29:31.237 --> 29:33.270
All right.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.372
We'll take my car.

29:35.374 --> 29:37.908
Uh, Miss Daisy isn't
supposed to drive.

29:39.345 --> 29:40.444
Come on.

29:40.446 --> 29:41.512
All right.

29:43.249 --> 29:45.516
(engine revs)

29:45.518 --> 29:46.984
(Deeks screams)
(tires screech)

29:46.986 --> 29:48.385
Fraggle Rock!

29:48.387 --> 29:50.187
Oh...
(inhales sharply)

29:50.189 --> 29:52.890
We must've beat Callen and Sam.

29:52.892 --> 29:54.225
Yay!

29:54.226 --> 29:55.559
Yeah, I think we also
beat the sound barrier.

29:55.561 --> 29:57.044
Yay.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.528
You, by chance, weren't
the one that taught Nell

29:58.531 --> 30:00.297
how to drive, were you?

30:00.299 --> 30:02.149
No.

30:02.150 --> 30:04.000
I-I gave her a few
defensive driving lessons.

30:04.003 --> 30:05.435
Yeah, I can see that.

30:05.437 --> 30:08.138
You should probably
get a haircut.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.007
Oh, don't worry.
Next time, I'll...

30:10.009 --> 30:11.175
I'll wear a helmet.

30:11.177 --> 30:12.576
Possible a parachute.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.111
Definitely a diaper.

30:15.281 --> 30:17.481
Told you
she was fast.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.082
How'd you beat us here?

30:19.084 --> 30:20.551
I took a shortcut.

30:20.553 --> 30:22.352
The sidewalk.

30:22.354 --> 30:24.021
You took a sidewalk.

30:24.023 --> 30:27.090
¶ ¶

30:55.487 --> 30:58.055
¶ ¶

31:00.626 --> 31:01.592
She's in there.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.965
Federal agents!

31:07.967 --> 31:09.566
DEEKS:
Natalie?

31:09.568 --> 31:12.002
Amber, we're here to help!

31:12.004 --> 31:15.205
Stay close, Hetty.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.274
Hetty?

31:23.215 --> 31:25.415
It's over, dear.

31:27.186 --> 31:28.352
Please stop.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.053
(grunts)

31:47.006 --> 31:49.373
I said I'll talk if you
provide me with a lawyer

31:49.375 --> 31:51.942
and protection
and witness relocation.

31:51.944 --> 31:53.477
That's quite the list.

31:53.479 --> 31:55.279
I have quite a lot
of information.

31:55.281 --> 31:56.480
We don't need
a lot of information.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.148
We just need to know
who you're working for.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.683
Then give me what I need.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.184
There's nothing here.

32:01.186 --> 32:02.085
Let's go.

32:02.087 --> 32:03.186
Hetty?

32:03.188 --> 32:04.588
Well, she needs us

32:04.590 --> 32:05.956
more than we need her.

32:05.958 --> 32:07.491
Right now,

32:07.493 --> 32:09.526
she's more valuable
to us as bait.

32:10.496 --> 32:11.929
NATALIE:
You can't

32:11.931 --> 32:13.163
leave me here.

32:13.165 --> 32:14.364
I said I'll talk.

32:14.366 --> 32:17.000
Just... get me out of here.

32:18.103 --> 32:20.504
We'll take her to the boatshed.

32:20.506 --> 32:21.505
Let's go.

32:21.507 --> 32:22.539
See you there.

32:22.541 --> 32:24.608
I'll, uh,
I'll ride with them.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.643
You know, just for
a little extra protection.

32:26.645 --> 32:29.546
Just get in the damn car,
Martin.

32:30.616 --> 32:31.715
Yes. Yes, Mom.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.483
In the car.

32:33.485 --> 32:35.552
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

32:36.956 --> 32:39.489
So, we caught Natalie
at your house.

32:39.491 --> 32:42.392
We're taking her
into custody now.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.461
I'm gonna get back to my team.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.131
Was that
story true?

32:49.635 --> 32:52.135
About that guy that died?

32:52.137 --> 32:54.371
What do you think?

32:57.276 --> 32:59.309
Good-bye, Carl.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.178
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

33:01.180 --> 33:02.713
Good-bye, Nell.

33:04.683 --> 33:07.584
MAN (over P.A.):
Visitation hours end
in 15 minutes.

33:07.586 --> 33:12.055
Repeat: visitation hours
end in 15 minutes.

33:19.765 --> 33:21.732
Those two guys you shot,
you work with them?

33:21.734 --> 33:23.133
NATALIE:
I'll talk

33:23.135 --> 33:24.234
when I get my lawyer.

33:24.236 --> 33:26.203
Your lawyer isn't
saving your life.

33:26.205 --> 33:27.270
CALLEN:
Sam, behind us!

33:27.272 --> 33:29.473
(tires screeching)

33:30.542 --> 33:31.475
There's two of them.

33:39.051 --> 33:39.750
We're pinned in.

33:39.752 --> 33:41.752
Get out, move, move, move!

33:47.192 --> 33:49.026
Stay down! Stay down!

33:57.169 --> 33:58.268
Go!

34:02.574 --> 34:04.174
Natalie!

34:04.176 --> 34:05.642
Wait!
Natalie!

34:06.345 --> 34:08.745
(groaning)

34:10.682 --> 34:12.482
(tires screech)

34:23.562 --> 34:26.830
Eric, we've been ambushed.
Natalie's on the run.

34:26.832 --> 34:29.166
Looks like she may
have been hit.

34:29.168 --> 34:30.667
Hey, Sam?

34:38.210 --> 34:40.477
Eric, we need an ambulance.

34:40.479 --> 34:41.578
All right,
help will be here soon.

34:41.580 --> 34:42.813
It's important
that you stay calm.

34:42.815 --> 34:43.814
(grunting)

34:43.816 --> 34:45.082
Easy, easy.

34:45.084 --> 34:46.583
Easy.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.418
I bet you weren't
this nice to Carl Brown.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.288
Natalie,
listen to me.

34:51.290 --> 34:52.389
We need your help.

34:52.391 --> 34:53.824
Who do you work for?

34:53.826 --> 34:55.325
Where did you
meet them?

34:55.327 --> 34:57.160
Someone...

34:57.162 --> 35:00.764
put out a hit on me
when my name got leaked.

35:00.766 --> 35:04.668
I was on my way to
your house for help.

35:04.670 --> 35:06.603
And those guys
came after me.

35:10.142 --> 35:11.775
Did you know them?

35:11.777 --> 35:13.410
No.

35:13.412 --> 35:15.712
But I think
they work for the...

35:15.714 --> 35:17.314
the same person I did.

35:17.316 --> 35:20.183
SAM: Tell us who.
Natalie.

35:20.185 --> 35:21.685
Hey, you can make this right.

35:21.687 --> 35:23.386
Tell us who.

35:23.388 --> 35:24.788
(heavy breath)

35:24.790 --> 35:26.656
Make it right.

35:26.658 --> 35:27.824
Rae.

35:27.826 --> 35:29.826
"Rae."

35:29.828 --> 35:31.428
Lemon Grove Park.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.463
Mostly at night.

35:33.465 --> 35:35.365
(gasping)

35:37.169 --> 35:39.336
CALLEN:
Eric?

35:39.338 --> 35:40.871
Let's start looking
at night footage

35:40.873 --> 35:42.405
from security cams
in Lemon Grove Park

35:42.407 --> 35:44.508
or any park nearby.

35:44.510 --> 35:46.476
(distant sirens wailing)

35:46.478 --> 35:48.211
She's gone.

35:54.186 --> 35:55.919
ERIC:
<i> I think Rae is a woman.</i>

35:55.921 --> 35:57.721
This woman, to be specific.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.273
She's appeared

35:59.274 --> 36:00.824
several times on the outskirts
of Lemon Grove Park.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.859
We got a pretty good look
on her face right here.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.194
This is a week ago.

36:04.196 --> 36:05.546
We haven't had a
chance to I.D. her yet.

36:05.547 --> 36:06.897
GRANGER:
She said her name was Heather.

36:06.899 --> 36:10.667
She tried to pick me up
a couple months back at a bar.

36:10.669 --> 36:14.371
Is this the only image
we have of her?

36:14.373 --> 36:15.672
Well, it'll take me a while
to scrub through the data

36:15.674 --> 36:17.307
to get more info,
but I'm on it.

36:22.314 --> 36:24.714
I'd send you all home,

36:24.716 --> 36:27.717
but I can't even guarantee
that that's safe.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.887
We'll handle it.

36:34.326 --> 36:35.926
I'm gonna go be with Kensi.

36:35.928 --> 36:37.427
Keep your ears
and eyes open.

36:37.429 --> 36:39.462
Thanks, brother.

36:46.371 --> 36:49.372
You really want
to wait till morning?

36:51.543 --> 36:53.476
What do you think?

36:56.515 --> 36:57.714
Kens?

36:57.716 --> 36:59.783
Baby?

37:24.276 --> 37:26.343
(gunshots)

37:39.424 --> 37:41.858
After hours training?

37:41.860 --> 37:43.994
Ah...

37:43.996 --> 37:46.029
Didn't know you were still here.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.464
You didn't want to see anybody.

37:47.466 --> 37:48.632
Uh...

37:48.634 --> 37:50.500
No, I just,
I didn't want to interfere

37:50.502 --> 37:51.768
with anybody's practice time,
that's all.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.536
And I'm going

37:53.538 --> 37:57.374
to take the NCIS Special Agent
physical fitness test.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.509
Why? You don't have
anything to prove.

37:59.511 --> 38:00.577
Yes, I do,

38:00.579 --> 38:02.479
if I'm gonna come back.

38:04.416 --> 38:07.651
You're gonna let me
come back, right?

38:07.653 --> 38:10.720
I don't think you're ready.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.756
Oh, no, Hetty, you're wrong.

38:12.758 --> 38:13.790
I'm ready.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.792
I'm ready.
I've been jogging

38:15.794 --> 38:17.661
and working out and shooting.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.696
I am ready.

38:21.066 --> 38:24.501
All right, let me see you
shoot with your left hand.

38:24.503 --> 38:26.736
But I'm right-handed.

38:26.738 --> 38:28.638
So am I.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.975
Okay.

38:31.977 --> 38:34.077
All right.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.580
So, what do you want me to do--

38:37.582 --> 38:39.983
my initials... smiley face?
(laughs)

38:39.985 --> 38:41.017
Oh, no.

38:41.019 --> 38:43.086
Just shoot the target.

38:47.726 --> 38:48.992
Oops.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.827
(clip rattling)

38:56.868 --> 38:58.802
(Hetty clears throat)

39:00.706 --> 39:02.605
Right.

39:02.607 --> 39:04.674
Force of habit.

39:06.345 --> 39:08.411
(sighs)

39:15.120 --> 39:16.920
(quiet laugh)

39:16.922 --> 39:18.988
Okay.

39:36.908 --> 39:39.809
Guess I just need
a little more practice.

39:40.946 --> 39:44.514
Just take your time.

39:44.516 --> 39:46.583
¶ ¶

39:57.028 --> 40:00.797
¶ But will it always remain? ¶

40:03.034 --> 40:04.801
Another gin?

40:04.803 --> 40:05.802
I'm gonna have

40:05.804 --> 40:07.904
a soda with a slice of lime.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.157
You got it, sir.

40:10.158 --> 40:12.409
¶ Can we avoid mistakes
from the past? ¶

40:14.546 --> 40:17.614
¶ Oh, and what if it dies? ¶

40:17.616 --> 40:19.182
(ice rattles)

40:19.184 --> 40:20.784
Looks like she's not
coming in tonight.

40:20.786 --> 40:21.951
(soda sprays)

40:21.953 --> 40:23.420
¶ Just disappears
from your eyes... ¶

40:23.422 --> 40:25.188
Yeah, I should've
gotten her number.

40:26.158 --> 40:27.557
Oh, well.

40:27.559 --> 40:29.559
¶ Well, you don't have
to answer... ¶

40:29.561 --> 40:31.027
You know, you remind me

40:31.029 --> 40:32.796
of Humphrey Bogart
in<i> Casablanca.</i>

40:32.798 --> 40:34.898
Like a badass,

40:34.900 --> 40:36.566
but, uh,

40:36.568 --> 40:39.469
also a little sad.

40:39.471 --> 40:40.837
¶ Well, I know
you're a dancer... ¶

40:40.839 --> 40:43.940
CALLEN (over radio):
He's not wrong, Granger.

40:43.942 --> 40:47.644
You know, Bogey didn't get
the girl in the end, either.

40:50.515 --> 40:52.115
That's true.

40:52.117 --> 40:53.883
¶ Oh, is this love? ¶

40:53.885 --> 40:55.718
¶ A light in the dark
of the world... ¶

40:55.720 --> 40:57.987
Listen, you might want
to add some gin.

40:57.989 --> 40:59.456
¶ Oh, is this love? ¶

40:59.458 --> 41:02.091
¶ A light in the dark
of the world ¶

41:02.093 --> 41:05.161
¶ Oh, is this love? ¶

41:05.163 --> 41:08.665
¶ A light in the dark
of the world... ¶

41:08.667 --> 41:10.667
Cheers.

41:10.669 --> 41:12.535
¶ A light... ¶

41:15.474 --> 41:17.540
Gonna be a long night.

41:19.945 --> 41:21.578
We'll get her, G.

41:22.714 --> 41:25.615
Her and everybody else
behind this.

41:25.617 --> 41:28.785
We're gonna find
the head of the snake.

41:30.889 --> 41:31.955
<i> Then we're gonna chop it off.</i>
