00:58.141 --> 00:59.685
This is for the Senate!

01:17.911 --> 01:19.371
Bring him to the palace...

01:19.454 --> 01:20.455
alive.

01:47.858 --> 01:48.817
It's fine.

01:52.779 --> 01:53.697
Let him through!

01:55.198 --> 01:56.074
Commodus.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.326
Thank the Gods, you're alright.

01:57.409 --> 01:58.785
They came for you too?

01:59.369 --> 02:01.830
We stopped at the brothel
on our way to the Coliseum.

02:02.748 --> 02:04.291
They ambushed us.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.002
Saoterus?

02:08.044 --> 02:09.295
They moved too quickly.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.090
I managed to hold them off,
but Saoterus...

02:14.301 --> 02:15.886
Find out who was behind this.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.931
It doesn't matter what it takes.

02:19.932 --> 02:21.099
With pleasure.

04:21.637 --> 04:22.930
For Commodus,

04:23.931 --> 04:28.644
the attempt on his life
and the murder of his closest advisor...

04:29.144 --> 04:31.605
shakes the foundation of his reign.

04:38.612 --> 04:39.821
When you think about

04:39.905 --> 04:42.074
somebody like Commodus growing up

04:42.157 --> 04:44.952
and coming into a position
of enormous responsibility.

04:46.203 --> 04:49.289
It's not simply that
they're an individual of great wealth

04:49.373 --> 04:51.250
and everybody's
gonna be jealous.

04:53.293 --> 04:57.005
One can suppose that
they must have felt enormously isolated.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.841
The number of people
whom they felt they could trust

04:59.925 --> 05:01.969
must be extraordinarily small.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.571
Cleander knows that
to keep the trust of the Emperor...

05:20.654 --> 05:23.782
and eliminate any ties to
the murder of Saoterus,

05:23.865 --> 05:25.909
he'll have to cover his tracks.

05:31.123 --> 05:34.001
Starting with the Senate member
who aided in the plot...

05:35.085 --> 05:36.545
Quintianus.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.559
I've waited a long time for this.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.438
Convince Commodus to spare my life.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.566
If you do that,

05:58.150 --> 05:59.902
I won't say anything.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.029
You have my word.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.701
That's one option.

06:14.666 --> 06:15.667
Wait...

06:18.212 --> 06:19.671
No, wait...

06:39.024 --> 06:40.317
Finish him.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.971
After the failed attempt
on her brother's life,

07:11.974 --> 07:15.143
Lucilla knows her efforts
have gone to waste...

07:15.227 --> 07:19.523
and her connection to the plot
could be exposed at any moment.

07:35.706 --> 07:36.665
He talked.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.458
I'll hear it for myself.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.961
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.547
So he's dead.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.594
Who else was involved?

07:50.387 --> 07:51.555
There's one more.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.141
Who?

07:56.852 --> 08:00.022
Your sister. Lucilla.

08:12.284 --> 08:13.994
Bring her to me.

08:22.377 --> 08:25.505
If you were Emperor, you would be

08:25.589 --> 08:29.176
the individual upon which
millions of people depended

08:29.259 --> 08:30.886
on a day-to-day basis.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.140
But of course, it's far more
than any one individual can pull off.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.311
You have to delegate.
You need assistance.

08:39.394 --> 08:40.812
You have to find other people.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.607
But Roman society
is incredibly competitive.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.692
Who do you trust?

09:18.976 --> 09:19.810
Bring her in.

09:39.997 --> 09:42.082
Senator Quintianus tried to kill me.

09:43.542 --> 09:44.626
He failed.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.087
So I've heard.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.509
Ask your question, brother.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.519
You are supposed to be
the most powerful man in the world.

10:03.478 --> 10:04.771
Emperor of Rome.

10:06.815 --> 10:09.651
Is that why your playmate
is not in chains beside me?

10:12.863 --> 10:14.740
Would it be too
difficult for you?

10:16.950 --> 10:20.120
It always amazes me the lengths
a woman will go to to cover up...

10:21.955 --> 10:23.832
well, anything really.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.752
I see you've a cut, Cleander.

10:27.586 --> 10:29.713
Is that from Saoterus's knife?

10:29.796 --> 10:30.881
Enough!

10:31.757 --> 10:33.342
Lies will get you nowhere.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.723
Just because you can't handle the answers
doesn't make them lies.

10:41.683 --> 10:44.019
If you want to know
why your sister wanted you dead,

10:44.603 --> 10:46.230
all you need do is ask.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.526
I've done nothing to you.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.114
You were born.

10:57.241 --> 10:59.534
And from the moment
you entered this world,

11:00.244 --> 11:01.662
I've been pushed aside,

11:03.580 --> 11:06.625
forgotten, sold into marriage.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.545
All for the greater glory of Commodus.

11:10.045 --> 11:11.755
I never asked for any of that.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.634
And I never asked to be
born a woman.

11:17.803 --> 11:20.931
To have our father turn his back
on a century of tradition.

11:21.974 --> 11:24.309
To have no control over
anything that happens to me.

11:24.393 --> 11:25.352
But here we are.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.481
You tried to kill me.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.194
You've taken my life, brother.

11:34.278 --> 11:37.030
I only thought it fair
I do the same to you.

11:54.298 --> 11:56.884
Always the strong one,
eh, Commodus?

12:05.475 --> 12:08.395
It seems your Emperor cares more
for your family than you do.

12:13.358 --> 12:14.985
He will spare your life,

12:16.320 --> 12:18.280
but your time here in Rome
is at an end.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.992
I must admit, Cleander,

12:24.036 --> 12:25.454
I am impressed.

12:40.844 --> 12:43.639
With her conspiracy,
Lucilla was working directly

12:43.722 --> 12:45.807
with members of
that inner circle.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.477
These were incredibly important people.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.813
This was not simply a minor plot,

12:51.897 --> 12:54.942
but this was essentially
the inner workings of the state

12:55.025 --> 12:56.401
moving against itself.

13:06.370 --> 13:09.539
Cleander has
successfully eliminated his competition...

13:10.666 --> 13:13.669
and any trace
to his involvement in the plot.

13:21.677 --> 13:24.846
Commodus orders his sister
to the Island of Capri,

13:25.722 --> 13:28.183
more than 100 miles from Rome...

13:34.481 --> 13:36.525
where she's forced to live in exile.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.313
Commodus has her murdered.

14:57.522 --> 14:58.774
This isn't surprising.

14:58.857 --> 15:01.902
What else would you do with someone
who has tried to assassinate you?

15:03.987 --> 15:06.865
With a member of your own family
who has betrayed you?

15:07.741 --> 15:10.160
It's too risky
to have them alive.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.678
After ordering
the execution of his own sister,

15:28.762 --> 15:32.015
Commodus begins to
distance himself from the throne...

15:34.685 --> 15:37.604
and Cleander sees the opportunity
he's been waiting for.

15:46.738 --> 15:47.906
It's finished then.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.411
There were more on the list.

15:59.710 --> 16:02.129
If we don't act now,
there will be others.

16:06.383 --> 16:07.843
They'll see it as an opening.

16:10.846 --> 16:11.930
Brother...

16:12.848 --> 16:14.766
Do we want to be
seen as weak?

16:18.103 --> 16:19.021
No...

16:23.775 --> 16:25.277
I can't have this happen again.

16:27.696 --> 16:29.114
You can count on me.

16:33.285 --> 16:34.119
Cleander...

16:37.789 --> 16:38.957
I won't forget this.

16:47.966 --> 16:49.760
By deceiving Commodus,

16:50.636 --> 16:53.055
Cleander continues to gain his trust...

16:58.602 --> 17:01.647
and is soon given the position
he's always wanted,

17:02.981 --> 17:05.651
Chief Advisor
to the Roman Emperor.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.367
This is the biggest problem

17:14.451 --> 17:15.911
that Commodus faces.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.496
He is easily manipulated.

17:18.747 --> 17:20.915
He's easily manipulated by
the various groups around him.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.794
And rather than taking a leadership
position as the Emperor,

17:24.670 --> 17:25.712
he allows himself to be led.

17:25.796 --> 17:28.423
He allows himself to be put aside.

17:28.507 --> 17:33.804
And he allows individuals like Cleander
to take up a leadership position.

17:44.064 --> 17:44.898
More.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.265
Commodus, it's late.

18:21.435 --> 18:23.604
It's not good for you to sit here
drinking all night...

18:23.687 --> 18:26.315
I know it's been difficult,
but this isn't going--

18:26.398 --> 18:27.983
Done! Just...

18:30.235 --> 18:31.069
Enough.

18:41.371 --> 18:43.415
Just come to bed with me.

18:46.001 --> 18:47.753
And what would be the purpose of that?

18:54.676 --> 18:56.053
You have one job,

18:58.597 --> 19:00.057
and you have failed me...

19:01.391 --> 19:04.561
again and again.

19:07.272 --> 19:09.858
Tell me, dear wife,

19:11.443 --> 19:12.778
where is my son?

19:23.872 --> 19:26.041
Please Marcia,
clean up my husband's mess.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.802
Crispina didn't produce any children.

19:37.719 --> 19:40.556
What a woman had to do
was not be sexually attractive,

19:40.639 --> 19:42.099
but she must be able to have children.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.351
She must produce sons.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.814
Provided she did that,

19:48.897 --> 19:51.233
that was her main task.

19:51.316 --> 19:54.528
If she didn't do that,
then that was potentially quite serious.

21:03.013 --> 21:06.683
As Commodus grows further
detached from his role as Emperor,

21:08.310 --> 21:11.146
Cleander begins to consolidate his power.

21:15.609 --> 21:16.818
One of the most important figures

21:16.902 --> 21:19.071
for understanding the role
of the Emperor Commodus

21:19.154 --> 21:20.572
is the figure of Cleander.

21:20.656 --> 21:24.201
Cleander was the second freedman

21:24.785 --> 21:27.663
that Commodus put enormous trust in.

21:28.205 --> 21:29.665
And Commodus had checked out at this point

21:29.748 --> 21:32.376
and was not interested in
the serious business of governing.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.795
So what happens is Cleander,

21:34.878 --> 21:37.130
in particular we're told,
sought to enrich himself.

21:41.718 --> 21:43.262
With his power cemented,

21:44.179 --> 21:47.099
Cleander can set in motion
his ultimate plan.

21:49.977 --> 21:52.646
Determined to win favor
among the Roman people,

21:53.605 --> 21:55.482
and amass a fortune of his own,

21:56.233 --> 22:00.153
Cleander begins selling off
high-ranking positions in the Empire...

22:05.534 --> 22:07.452
starting with seats

22:07.536 --> 22:08.704
in the Roman Senate.

22:21.049 --> 22:22.175
Something the matter, Dio?

22:25.470 --> 22:27.973
I have never heard the Senate so silent.

22:32.185 --> 22:33.437
I wouldn't enjoy it too much.

22:34.980 --> 22:36.523
It's the sound of betrayal, after all.

22:36.607 --> 22:38.066
Or the absence of it.

22:38.567 --> 22:41.570
For these few who remain
are as loyal as you and I,

22:41.653 --> 22:42.529
are they not?

22:43.572 --> 22:44.698
Perhaps,

22:45.866 --> 22:48.410
but wise men know things
are not always as they appear.

22:48.493 --> 22:51.622
You speak the truth, Cleander.

22:54.041 --> 22:56.501
You know, it really is quite impressive,
all you've accomplished,

22:56.585 --> 22:59.713
and there is much more to come,
I have no doubt.

23:00.255 --> 23:04.426
But for now, the business of the Senate
awaits us old wise men.

23:06.178 --> 23:07.846
You forget yourself, Dio.

23:10.224 --> 23:11.808
Not all of the Senate are here.

23:36.250 --> 23:38.085
By removing the old guard,

23:39.628 --> 23:41.421
and selling seats to his allies,

23:43.549 --> 23:46.343
Cleander has secured
the Senate's loyalty...

23:52.766 --> 23:56.103
and has disturbed
the balance of an institution

23:56.645 --> 24:00.107
that has governed for nearly 700 years.

24:05.904 --> 24:08.198
Since the founding of the republic,

24:09.575 --> 24:13.161
seats of the Senate
have been reserved for the elite.

24:15.247 --> 24:16.081
Traditionally,

24:16.164 --> 24:17.332
to be in the Senate

24:17.416 --> 24:20.961
was to attain the very pinnacle of status
within the Roman state.

24:21.587 --> 24:25.340
It took its name
from the Latin for "old man", senex.

24:25.424 --> 24:29.052
It embodied the great
and the good of the city.

24:32.222 --> 24:34.766
Only those from Senate lineage

24:34.850 --> 24:36.518
are eligible for service.

24:38.854 --> 24:40.397
To be a Senator in Rome,

24:40.480 --> 24:44.568
your father had to be a Senator.
So it was largely hereditary.

24:45.485 --> 24:48.655
Cassius Dio, he was a Senator
and later a consul,

24:48.739 --> 24:51.158
and his father had been a Senator.

24:51.241 --> 24:55.996
So he's very much from the
aristocratic part of Roman society.

25:06.215 --> 25:08.508
With the Senate in his pocket,

25:08.592 --> 25:11.303
Cleander now looks to the Roman people,

25:12.387 --> 25:16.058
and believes there's only one way
to guarantee their support.

25:18.936 --> 25:22.356
Cleander knows the masses
are a powerful force in the Empire.

25:23.649 --> 25:26.109
and he can solidify their dependence,

25:26.610 --> 25:28.320
and gain their favor,

25:29.154 --> 25:31.281
by threatening their food supply.

25:34.826 --> 25:36.245
For centuries,

25:36.328 --> 25:40.457
the survival of the Empire
has depended on imported grain.

25:44.461 --> 25:45.879
The city of Rome was probably

25:45.963 --> 25:48.590
over one million people strong.

25:48.674 --> 25:51.843
It's an enormous city
by preindustrial standards.

25:52.469 --> 25:55.055
Because of that,
they ship huge quantities of grain in

25:55.138 --> 25:58.225
from North Africa
and above all, from Egypt,

25:58.308 --> 26:00.644
and they give it to every Roman citizen.

26:01.186 --> 26:02.771
It probably accounts for something like

26:02.854 --> 26:08.610
40 or 50 percent of the family food
requirement in each year.

26:08.694 --> 26:12.030
So it's a very significant perk
of being a Roman citizen.

26:16.118 --> 26:17.119
But in Rome,

26:18.203 --> 26:20.747
grain does more than just feed the people.

26:21.999 --> 26:25.711
As those in power
have used rations and shortages...

26:27.254 --> 26:29.715
to keep control of the lower classes.

26:32.843 --> 26:35.554
Rome had vastly outgrown the capacity

26:35.637 --> 26:37.514
to feed those who lived in it.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.852
So, ambitious Roman politicians
had begun to recognize

26:41.935 --> 26:47.065
that a way to entrench power
was to provide

26:47.149 --> 26:49.610
the mass of common citizens in the city

26:50.068 --> 26:51.778
with a bread dole.

26:52.696 --> 26:55.949
But if they did not supply bread
to the Roman people,

26:57.075 --> 26:59.745
then their own survival
might well be at stake.

27:02.164 --> 27:05.000
Determined to gain
the favor of the Roman people,

27:06.084 --> 27:08.754
Cleander devises a sophisticated plan.

27:10.797 --> 27:13.550
He believes if he can
manipulate the grain supply,

27:14.468 --> 27:16.845
he can create a food crisis in Rome.

27:22.684 --> 27:24.061
Take this to the Senate.

27:27.648 --> 27:30.400
Cleander looks at his position

27:30.484 --> 27:33.904
as a way for him to gain his own power
and gain his own popularity.

27:34.571 --> 27:39.159
The rumors being of course that Cleander
takes stores of food and keeps them,

27:39.243 --> 27:41.203
and then purposely creates

27:41.286 --> 27:44.289
a famine within the city
so that he can come out as the hero,

27:44.373 --> 27:46.458
and popular among the people.

27:56.093 --> 27:59.263
While Cleander continues
his campaign for power,

28:00.514 --> 28:03.100
Commodus returns to his reckless ways.

29:40.030 --> 29:42.950
Marcia is a slave in the royal palace.

29:43.867 --> 29:46.078
But after catching the eye of the Emperor,

29:47.329 --> 29:50.499
she becomes
his personal servant and mistress,

29:51.333 --> 29:54.086
known in Rome as a concubine.

29:58.173 --> 29:59.424
In the palace,

30:00.008 --> 30:03.095
the Emperor has his choice
of attractive slaves...

30:05.180 --> 30:09.268
servants available for pleasure
day and night.

30:10.894 --> 30:12.938
To be sure, Emperors, by and large,

30:13.939 --> 30:15.857
slept with as many people
as they wanted,

30:15.941 --> 30:17.401
used as many people
as they wanted.

30:18.318 --> 30:21.154
Provided that they were not
of citizen status.

30:28.287 --> 30:31.582
There was a provision
in Roman law that

30:31.665 --> 30:33.333
any Roman, not just an Emperor,

30:33.417 --> 30:35.669
could indeed have a concubine.

30:37.129 --> 30:40.799
Concubinage was a status under Roman law,

30:40.883 --> 30:44.511
but it was less common
for an Emperor to do it

30:44.595 --> 30:48.056
quite as openly
as Commodus took Marcia.

30:51.602 --> 30:55.439
But while Marcia begins
spending more time with the Emperor,

30:56.273 --> 30:58.025
she's still a servant in the palace...

30:59.860 --> 31:02.613
alongside her husband, Eclectus.

31:08.327 --> 31:09.995
Hey, I thought you were
done for the night.

31:10.579 --> 31:13.540
The Emperor required me,
but I'm going to bed now.

31:48.408 --> 31:49.368
Please sit down.

31:55.457 --> 31:56.542
You're leaving Rome.

31:58.835 --> 32:00.003
Where are we going?

32:03.006 --> 32:04.591
You'll go to the country estate.

32:06.301 --> 32:08.637
It'll be safe there, away from the plague.

32:10.180 --> 32:11.848
You'll follow later, then.

32:13.141 --> 32:14.685
My place is in Rome.

32:18.021 --> 32:19.648
How long will I be gone for?

32:21.275 --> 32:22.776
I'll send for you
when I think it's safe to return.

32:22.859 --> 32:25.445
-But I don't want to leave--
-It's best you leave immediately.

32:27.781 --> 32:28.865
Safer.

32:38.333 --> 32:40.419
-Marcia, let's go.
-No.

32:41.253 --> 32:43.255
Marcia and Eclectus will stay with me.

32:49.720 --> 32:51.263
You'll let me know
when wish me to return?

32:59.646 --> 33:00.772
As soon as it's safe.

33:06.737 --> 33:08.322
For Commodus,

33:08.405 --> 33:12.367
the Empress has failed one of
the most important roles in the palace.

33:14.786 --> 33:16.330
Unable to give him an heir,

33:18.165 --> 33:19.917
she's banished to Capri,

33:21.210 --> 33:23.295
never to return to Rome.

33:31.929 --> 33:34.765
The Emperor's focus continues to drift,

33:35.641 --> 33:39.811
allowing Cleander to continue
with his ruthless scheme.

33:41.396 --> 33:43.315
But news of the grain shortage

33:43.398 --> 33:46.652
soon reaches
high-ranking members of the Senate.

33:47.110 --> 33:48.237
Now go see to it.

33:50.280 --> 33:52.449
You seem to have
taken to the managing of the city well.

33:52.532 --> 33:54.117
All it takes is a firm hand.

33:55.535 --> 33:58.580
Strength. I've never lacked for that.

33:58.664 --> 34:01.667
I'm sure you already have a plan
to deal with the grain shortage.

34:02.834 --> 34:04.294
Well, it's certainly strange.

34:05.295 --> 34:08.549
All shipments from Alexandria
have stopped, but no one knows why.

34:08.632 --> 34:10.509
I'm aware of the grain shortage.

34:12.427 --> 34:13.512
And...

34:14.263 --> 34:16.014
Do you intend to do anything about it?

34:16.098 --> 34:17.975
I intend to manage it.

34:19.016 --> 34:20.268
Well, within the week,

34:20.351 --> 34:22.563
the mills at the Aqua Traiana
will have nothing to produce,

34:22.646 --> 34:24.438
and then a few days after that,

34:25.315 --> 34:27.734
all distribution in the city will cease.

34:28.610 --> 34:30.070
People will starve.

34:32.030 --> 34:35.367
And I'm sure the Senate would resolve this
through endless discussion.

34:37.369 --> 34:38.536
No, Dio.

34:39.246 --> 34:42.958
You may talk as much as you wish.
The palace will act.

34:43.542 --> 34:47.170
Oh, so the Emperor is aware of
the danger to his beloved city?

34:48.839 --> 34:51.466
The Emperor is not to be bothered
with trivialities.

34:57.222 --> 35:00.976
Cleander has redirected
shipments of grain from Egypt,

35:02.060 --> 35:04.771
stashing them away
for just the right moment.

35:07.816 --> 35:09.776
But what he fails to predict,

35:10.402 --> 35:13.947
is that the food shortage,
and spreading famine,

35:14.031 --> 35:18.076
create the perfect conditions
for the return of the plague.

35:18.577 --> 35:19.494
Gentlemen.

35:20.162 --> 35:21.288
Try the wine.

35:22.205 --> 35:23.540
It's delicious.

35:31.340 --> 35:32.174
Throughout Rome,

35:35.844 --> 35:37.596
thousands fall ill

35:39.723 --> 35:42.476
as the plague wreaks havoc
on the Roman people.

35:51.610 --> 35:54.154
Large cities, like Rome,

35:54.238 --> 35:56.907
had poor sort of health systems.

35:57.616 --> 36:03.205
And so, they were sinks of
germs and diseases of one sort or another.

36:03.288 --> 36:07.042
And it took a very long time
for that to be shaken off.

36:10.087 --> 36:12.130
With riots breaking out around the city,

36:13.257 --> 36:16.969
word of starvation and disease
reaches the palace.

36:36.405 --> 36:38.532
Cleander, thank you for coming.

36:39.199 --> 36:40.993
Would you mind filling my cup?

36:42.953 --> 36:43.954
Certainly.

36:49.126 --> 36:51.670
The plague. What are we doing about it?

36:54.256 --> 36:55.924
All that we can, of course.

36:59.636 --> 37:02.180
We are disposing of the bodies
as quickly as possible,

37:03.140 --> 37:06.810
setting up quarantines
and sick tents outside the city.

37:08.228 --> 37:09.187
Don't worry.

37:09.646 --> 37:11.231
We'll have it taken care of in no time.

37:12.524 --> 37:14.610
Why am I hearing
that my people are starving?

37:16.570 --> 37:20.282
We're having issues
with the grain shipments.

37:21.950 --> 37:24.369
Hungry people get sick. Sick people die.

37:25.203 --> 37:26.371
People need food.

37:26.830 --> 37:28.832
I'm afraid it's not as easy as it sounds.

37:29.958 --> 37:31.793
Double the subsidies.

37:31.877 --> 37:33.545
The shipments will
straighten themselves out.

37:35.088 --> 37:36.673
In the meantime, the people need food.

37:40.969 --> 37:43.597
Of course. You're right.
I'll double the grain shipments now.

37:50.145 --> 37:52.481
Is there anything else
my Emperor requires?

37:53.941 --> 37:55.525
Perhaps some time alone.

38:20.968 --> 38:22.970
With his advisor at the helm,

38:23.679 --> 38:27.015
Commodus continues
to avoid his obligations.

38:31.853 --> 38:33.522
But what he doesn't realize...

38:34.273 --> 38:36.525
is that in the hands
of his trusted advisor,

38:37.818 --> 38:39.528
the fate of his beloved city

38:40.362 --> 38:41.613
is in danger.

38:56.128 --> 38:59.256
The streets of Rome have turned to chaos.

39:03.176 --> 39:06.054
But Cleander is determined
to stick to his plan,

39:06.847 --> 39:10.809
believing he still has time
to release his grain supply

39:11.476 --> 39:13.103
and save the Empire.

39:17.983 --> 39:19.276
But before he can act,

39:21.069 --> 39:24.406
the masses begin to blame the royal palace

39:24.990 --> 39:27.659
and voice their frustrations
on the city walls.

39:33.540 --> 39:36.251
Used as a means of communication,

39:38.754 --> 39:42.382
graffiti is a powerful tool
of the Roman people.

39:48.847 --> 39:51.934
Graffiti was very commonplace
in the Roman Empire.

39:52.017 --> 39:53.936
If you look at the city of Pompeii,

39:54.019 --> 39:57.356
there are 13,000 examples
of it that survive

39:57.439 --> 40:00.734
in a town that had a population
of probably only that size.

40:02.069 --> 40:04.446
Mostly the graffiti is about politics.

40:04.529 --> 40:07.783
It's saying, "Vote for so-and-so
in the upcoming election."

40:07.866 --> 40:10.285
Or they are criticizing other people.

40:10.369 --> 40:14.081
Or many of them are just names
scratched onto the surfaces.

40:20.921 --> 40:21.880
As anger spreads,

40:23.632 --> 40:26.218
the Roman people demand answers...

40:31.139 --> 40:35.394
and begin to call for the man
Commodus trusted with the food supply...

40:36.687 --> 40:37.688
Cleander.

41:31.325 --> 41:33.785
That's him! That's Cleander.

41:40.500 --> 41:41.543
Get away from me!

42:00.270 --> 42:01.355
You...

42:01.438 --> 42:02.898
I want two guards on every door.

42:02.981 --> 42:04.316
No one is to enter the palace!

42:23.877 --> 42:24.711
Commodus!

42:41.311 --> 42:42.563
The whole city's gone mad.

42:43.063 --> 42:45.315
They attacked me in the streets!
I'm lucky to have gotten back here alive.

42:45.399 --> 42:46.942
Why would they attack you?

42:47.025 --> 42:48.652
Why are my people calling for your head?

42:52.322 --> 42:53.657
Cleander, what did you do?

42:54.866 --> 42:56.243
What did you do?
