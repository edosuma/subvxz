WEBVTT

00:01.634 --> 00:02.767
Previously... You're going to get

00:02.834 --> 00:04.368
through this, Coop. I shot someone,
Sum.

00:04.433 --> 00:05.334
Are we okay?

00:05.400 --> 00:06.800
Why wouldn't we be?

00:06.867 --> 00:09.001
'Cause since that night, we haven't
really talked about it.

00:09.067 --> 00:10.368
What are you doing back in Newport?

00:10.467 --> 00:12.667
Caleb dies, boom-- suddenly, you show
up.

00:12.734 --> 00:13.834
We'll collect on Caleb's will

00:13.901 --> 00:15.433
and we'll go back to being a normal,

00:15.500 --> 00:16.567
happy family.

00:16.634 --> 00:17.767
No matter how hard I worked

00:17.834 --> 00:18.834
or how hard I tried...

00:18.901 --> 00:19.800
It was never enough.

00:19.867 --> 00:21.400
Hi, I'm Charlotte Morgan.

00:21.467 --> 00:22.800
I'm not going back

00:22.867 --> 00:24.368
to my husband and my boys until I know

00:24.433 --> 00:25.600
that I'll never let them down again.

00:25.667 --> 00:27.368
Should be coming home any day now,
right?

00:37.601 --> 00:38.734
Morning, Dad.

00:38.801 --> 00:40.400
Hey, you're just in time for breakfast.

00:40.467 --> 00:41.434
Who wants cereal?

00:41.501 --> 00:42.601
We have cereal?

00:42.667 --> 00:44.400
Yeah, I found some tucked away in a
cabinet.

00:44.467 --> 00:46.434
Cereal doesn't go bad, does it?

00:46.501 --> 00:47.968
No, but milk does.

00:48.033 --> 00:49.300
How 'bout some hummus?

00:49.367 --> 00:50.234
For breakfast?

00:50.300 --> 00:51.300
Sure.

00:51.367 --> 00:53.767
With a side of... of sesame beef.

00:53.834 --> 00:55.234
Breakfast of champions.

00:55.300 --> 00:57.367
As much as I love botulism, I'll pass.

00:57.434 --> 00:58.667
Yeah, I'm going to stick with coffee.

00:58.734 --> 01:00.234
Come on, you guys. We got to eat
together.

01:00.300 --> 01:01.868
It's a special day. You're both
seniors.

01:01.934 --> 01:03.000
It's just registration.

01:03.067 --> 01:04.434
It's a coming-of-age moment.

01:04.501 --> 01:05.968
We Cohens love coming-of-age moments.

01:06.033 --> 01:07.567
You should have seen this guy at my bar
mitzvah.

01:07.634 --> 01:08.801
He was frothing at the mouth.

01:08.868 --> 01:10.667
I was excited then; I'm excited now.

01:10.734 --> 01:11.934
I'm proud of you both.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.234
And so is your mom,

01:13.300 --> 01:14.567
even though she's not here to tell you
about it.

01:14.634 --> 01:16.734
Or prevent us from living in a
cesspool.

01:16.801 --> 01:18.868
Boy, she kept this place in tip-top
shape

01:18.934 --> 01:20.901
without so much as picking up a sponge.

01:20.968 --> 01:22.067
Yeah, how did she do that?

01:22.133 --> 01:23.968
Oh, her presence kept us neat, Ryan.

01:24.033 --> 01:26.200
It's that Protestant evil eye.

01:26.267 --> 01:28.000
It's a powerful thing.

01:28.067 --> 01:29.167
She's a woman

01:29.234 --> 01:31.634
of many talents.

01:34.601 --> 01:36.801
We can have dinner tonight, right?

01:36.868 --> 01:38.334
Yeah, sure,

01:38.400 --> 01:39.300
just the three of us.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.200
Yeah, Ryan'll even clean up.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.234
He will.

01:42.300 --> 01:45.534
I'll pick up the steaks.

01:51.300 --> 01:54.133
Boy, you've got some nerve showing up
here.

01:54.200 --> 01:56.133
Look, I apologize

01:56.200 --> 01:58.901
for our... our little misunderstanding.

01:58.968 --> 02:00.267
Oh, so I misunderstood.

02:00.334 --> 02:02.567
You didn't try to frame Ryan for the
shooting.

02:02.634 --> 02:04.200
Sandy, I only did what any parent would
do.

02:04.267 --> 02:06.133
I was trying to keep my family afloat.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.701
Yeah, by using my kid as a raft.

02:07.767 --> 02:09.199
You can lecture me later, but right
now,

02:09.267 --> 02:10.868
we need to put our differences behind
us,

02:10.934 --> 02:12.267
because we have bigger problems.

02:12.334 --> 02:14.567
What's happened now?

02:14.634 --> 02:16.200
I got a call from the school this
morning.

02:16.267 --> 02:18.000
Apparently, the parents are protesting.

02:18.067 --> 02:20.267
They want Ryan and Marissa out.

02:20.334 --> 02:21.501
Oh, I should have seen that coming.

02:21.567 --> 02:22.968
I'll stop by there and talk to them.

02:23.033 --> 02:24.267
No, you don't get it.

02:24.334 --> 02:26.434
They have a petition. They filed a
motion.

02:26.501 --> 02:27.434
See you, Dad.

02:27.501 --> 02:28.501
Have a good day.

02:31.667 --> 02:33.534
Sandy, unless we can put a stop to
this,

02:33.601 --> 02:35.868
Ryan and Marissa are getting expelled.

03:16.834 --> 03:18.664
And we'll take the pancakes

03:18.731 --> 03:21.160
with extra butter.

03:21.227 --> 03:22.525
Thanks.

03:22.592 --> 03:24.355
Wow, that's the last time

03:24.422 --> 03:26.885
we'll ever order pancakes before
registration.

03:26.952 --> 03:28.448
And that's a sad thing to you?

03:28.516 --> 03:29.814
Yeah, it is sad.

03:29.881 --> 03:31.976
Everything we do this year is for the
last time.

03:32.043 --> 03:33.341
It's like a farewell tour.

03:33.408 --> 03:34.839
Actually, after the summer we've had,

03:34.906 --> 03:36.070
that doesn't sound so terrible...

03:36.137 --> 03:37.501
if we can make it through this year.

03:37.569 --> 03:38.998
Yeah, if we can get through graduation.

03:39.066 --> 03:40.264
With no major traumas.

03:40.331 --> 03:41.463
Then I'll be happy.

03:41.529 --> 03:42.828
No, you guys, that is unacceptable.

03:42.894 --> 03:44.658
Look, I know that our summer sucked.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.022
To say the least.

03:46.088 --> 03:47.519
But we made it through it.

03:47.587 --> 03:50.382
No one is in juvy or in a jumpsuit.

03:50.449 --> 03:51.846
I think Marissa would have worn one
well.

03:51.914 --> 03:53.044
I do.

03:53.111 --> 03:54.342
It's the right cut on you.

03:54.409 --> 03:56.273
The point is, the four of us are
together

03:56.339 --> 03:57.936
and it's our senior year,

03:58.004 --> 04:02.264
so it's our last time to make
everything all-time.

04:02.330 --> 04:04.060
Hmm.

04:06.125 --> 04:07.357
She makes a good point.

04:07.424 --> 04:09.586
She's becoming quite the motivational
speaker.

04:09.653 --> 04:10.917
MARISSA: Okay, Sum.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.947
You win. It'll be the best year ever.

04:13.014 --> 04:14.246
Thank you. High five.

04:14.312 --> 04:16.608
Best year ever!

04:28.657 --> 04:29.756
Jimmy couldn't make it?

04:29.823 --> 04:30.954
He's working.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.451
A business associate from Hawaii showed
up.

04:32.518 --> 04:33.583
Ah, just as well.

04:33.650 --> 04:35.080
One Montague, one Capulet;

04:35.147 --> 04:37.643
that should be plenty.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.741
Sandy, Julie, come on in.

04:41.970 --> 04:43.701
You have to understand--

04:43.768 --> 04:47.195
no student at Harbor has ever been
involved in a shooting.

04:47.262 --> 04:50.657
And I know, as principal, you have to
do something, but...

04:50.725 --> 04:52.555
if you could please avoid expulsion.

04:52.621 --> 04:54.018
There is a petition circling

04:54.086 --> 04:55.384
amongst the parents--

04:55.451 --> 04:57.214
almost a thousand signatures.

04:57.281 --> 04:59.644
It's hard to ignore that kind of
outcry.

04:59.711 --> 05:02.340
Dr. Kim, you know my daughter, right?

05:02.406 --> 05:04.003
Tall, pretty, wears Chanel--

05:04.071 --> 05:05.501
not exactly what you'd call "gangsta."

05:06.500 --> 05:08.030
Look, the bottom line is,

05:08.097 --> 05:09.195
Marissa and Ryan are good kids.

05:09.263 --> 05:11.526
They deserve to graduate with their
friends.

05:11.592 --> 05:13.189
And if it were up to me, they would.

05:13.257 --> 05:15.286
But it is up to you. I mean, you're the
principal.

05:15.353 --> 05:17.549
The board thought it would be a good
idea

05:17.617 --> 05:18.847
to bring in someone new,

05:18.914 --> 05:21.144
a specialist in school safety.

05:21.210 --> 05:23.473
Oh, you mean like a hall monitor?

05:23.541 --> 05:28.366
Flattering, but actually more like dean
of discipline.

05:28.434 --> 05:30.164
Jack Hess. Nice to meet you.

05:30.231 --> 05:32.727
Sandy Cohen. Julie Cooper-Nichol.

05:32.793 --> 05:34.658
I'm very anxious to talk about Marissa.

05:34.724 --> 05:36.022
And Ryan.

05:36.088 --> 05:38.418
Thanks, but I don't really think
that'll be necessary.

05:38.485 --> 05:39.583
I read their files,

05:39.650 --> 05:40.813
talked to the arresting officers.

05:40.881 --> 05:42.245
I know what I'm dealing with.

05:42.312 --> 05:44.109
Well, you never really know what you're
dealing with

05:44.176 --> 05:45.141
until you talk to the kid.

05:45.208 --> 05:46.804
I was a P.D. in the juvenile system

05:46.871 --> 05:48.103
for a number of years, and I...

05:48.170 --> 05:50.034
well, I've seen my fair share of kids
in trouble.

05:50.101 --> 05:51.531
So have I, Mr. Cohen.

05:51.598 --> 05:53.228
Got a master's in education,

05:53.296 --> 05:56.057
taught six years in boarding schools
back East.

05:56.124 --> 05:57.521
I like to think I know what I'm doing.

05:57.589 --> 05:58.721
I hope so.

05:58.820 --> 06:01.149
These kids very much want to go to
college.

06:01.217 --> 06:03.979
If you kick 'em out, they've got no
shot.

06:04.045 --> 06:08.072
Well, frankly... I'm not here to make
everyone happy.

06:10.902 --> 06:12.765
I'll let you know my answer by this
evening.

06:29.441 --> 06:31.736
Jimmy!

06:31.803 --> 06:33.601
Another scotch on the rocks for my
friend.

06:33.668 --> 06:34.666
Oh, friend.

06:34.732 --> 06:36.762
That's a... that's a good sign.

06:36.829 --> 06:38.394
You know I like you, Jimmy,

06:38.460 --> 06:40.590
even though you test my patience.

06:40.658 --> 06:43.053
Ah. Thank you.

06:43.120 --> 06:46.148
Soon. You, uh, will have the money
soon.

06:46.215 --> 06:47.778
Think you said that two months ago.

06:47.846 --> 06:49.975
Yeah, well the will's going to be read
any day now.

06:50.042 --> 06:51.772
You got to... you got to believe me.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.304
I believed you before

06:53.371 --> 06:54.967
when you said you were going to sell me
a boat,

06:55.035 --> 06:59.428
but you pissed away my deposit on some
crazy stock venture.

06:59.495 --> 07:00.958
Do we have to... do we have to relive
this?

07:01.026 --> 07:04.155
Point is, I'm nice...

07:04.221 --> 07:06.518
but I'm not as nice as I look.

07:06.584 --> 07:08.614
I got a lot of friends who'd be more
than happy

07:08.680 --> 07:10.445
to take care of this for me.

07:10.512 --> 07:13.772
All I got to do is pick up the phone.

07:13.839 --> 07:17.101
You're going to have your money.

07:17.168 --> 07:18.965
I promise.

07:25.223 --> 07:26.786
Coop, you need a wheelbarrow for that
binder.

07:26.854 --> 07:28.085
That thing's a monster.

07:28.152 --> 07:30.082
Well, it's everything I need for
Kickoff Carnival:

07:30.149 --> 07:32.611
waivers, invoices, vendor contract.

07:32.678 --> 07:35.274
Ow. That is so boring, it hurts.

07:35.341 --> 07:37.105
So I take it you won't be joining us

07:37.171 --> 07:38.470
for social committee this year.

07:38.536 --> 07:40.698
Hmm, let me think about it. No.

07:40.765 --> 07:42.262
Sum, it's our last year.

07:42.330 --> 07:44.127
What happened to living every moment?

07:44.194 --> 07:45.459
Well, Coop, you know how I feel

07:45.525 --> 07:46.988
about school- sponsored events--

07:47.056 --> 07:49.119
love to go to them, hate to plan them.

07:49.187 --> 07:50.850
I prefer not to look behind the
curtain.

07:50.917 --> 07:52.215
You see, if I join clubs,

07:52.282 --> 07:54.445
I'll have to hang out with girls like
that.

07:54.511 --> 07:55.642
Taylor Townsend?

07:55.709 --> 07:57.107
Okay, guys?

07:57.174 --> 08:00.667
I spent the whole summer working on
your Kickoff Carnival,

08:00.735 --> 08:02.698
so I have tons of great ideas.

08:02.765 --> 08:04.828
I mean, I didn't even have a vacation.

08:04.896 --> 08:07.292
But, you know, someone has to do it,
right?

08:07.359 --> 08:09.422
Coop, she's totally stealing your
meeting.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.819
Yeah, well, she's been fighting me

08:10.887 --> 08:13.183
for social chair since, like, freshman
year.

08:13.250 --> 08:15.513
God. Nothing I hate more than perky
blondes

08:15.578 --> 08:16.710
who want to take over the world.

08:16.778 --> 08:17.776
Come on.

08:19.839 --> 08:20.837
Taylor.

08:22.137 --> 08:24.433
Hey. Uh, think you're at Marissa's
podium.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.528
Marissa.

08:26.596 --> 08:27.694
I'm sorry.

08:27.761 --> 08:28.992
I just went ahead and guessed

08:29.059 --> 08:30.956
that you weren't going to be making it
today.

08:31.023 --> 08:33.951
Oh. Well, here I am.

08:34.018 --> 08:35.347
Well, I just assumed, with everything

08:35.416 --> 08:36.979
that you've been through this summer,

08:37.047 --> 08:38.876
you know, with the...

08:39.842 --> 08:41.008
Right.

08:41.073 --> 08:42.904
Well, I'm fine. Thanks.

08:43.936 --> 08:46.265
You are so strong.

08:46.333 --> 08:48.163
But, listen, sweetie, if it gets to be
too much,

08:48.230 --> 08:49.128
you just holler.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.691
I can totally take over,

08:50.759 --> 08:53.389
since I pretty much did the whole thing
myself last year.

08:54.853 --> 08:55.918
Uh-uh.

08:55.985 --> 08:57.514
Yeah, that's great and everything,

08:57.582 --> 08:59.380
but you want to take your stuff off the
podium now?

09:04.272 --> 09:06.600
Absolutely.

09:06.668 --> 09:10.462
I'll just be gone in a jiff.

09:11.429 --> 09:14.223
Okay. Let's go.

09:20.248 --> 09:21.577
Bye.

09:21.645 --> 09:23.942
Oh, that bitch is going down.

09:25.340 --> 09:27.669
You sure you don't need a Haz-Mat suit
in there?

09:27.736 --> 09:29.267
Oh, my God, look at this.

09:29.334 --> 09:30.730
Chicken skewers from the Fourth of
July.

09:30.798 --> 09:32.296
Those things fossilized yet?

09:32.363 --> 09:33.594
Yeah. What are you doing?

09:33.661 --> 09:36.589
Making a Seth Cohen starter pack for
Mom, rehab edition.

09:36.656 --> 09:37.887
Got their new Klausserman,

09:37.954 --> 09:39.219
got Cray Thompson's Blankets,

09:39.286 --> 09:40.849
and I got Motley Crue's Dirt.

09:40.917 --> 09:43.611
Figured it'd help put Mom's
indiscretions in perspective.

09:43.679 --> 09:45.875
Very thoughtful. All right, that's
pretty much everything.

09:45.942 --> 09:47.739
You want to give me a hand here?

09:52.832 --> 09:54.063
How are things with you and Marissa?

09:54.130 --> 09:55.262
Oh, they're fine.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.292
Fine?

09:59.356 --> 10:00.486
They're fine?

10:00.553 --> 10:02.916
Yeah, why wouldn't they be fine?

10:02.983 --> 10:04.846
I don't know, 'cause she shot your
brother?

10:04.913 --> 10:05.911
Throw the average couple

10:05.979 --> 10:06.877
for a loop.

10:06.943 --> 10:08.242
Look, we've been living and breathing

10:08.308 --> 10:09.539
with it all summer, and now it's over.

10:09.606 --> 10:10.704
We just want to put it behind us.

10:10.770 --> 10:12.201
But you guys have talked about it,
right?

10:12.269 --> 10:13.399
I mean, you've hashed it out?

10:13.466 --> 10:14.764
We don't need to.

10:14.831 --> 10:17.559
Dude, Summer and I fought over a comic
book for a year.

10:17.627 --> 10:18.991
Yeah, what's your point?

10:19.059 --> 10:21.055
It's just, if I've learned anything
from being with Summer,

10:21.122 --> 10:23.384
it's that every issue in a relationship
snowballs,

10:23.451 --> 10:25.381
even the small things.

10:25.448 --> 10:26.613
You got to deal with it,

10:26.680 --> 10:27.945
or eventually, it'll come between you.

10:43.255 --> 10:44.553
Skipping town?

10:45.617 --> 10:47.182
Ah, yeah.

10:47.249 --> 10:48.779
Checking out tomorrow.

10:48.847 --> 10:50.644
You?

10:50.710 --> 10:54.604
Yeah. Almost all packed.

10:54.671 --> 10:56.135
Oh, I just can't wait

10:56.202 --> 10:58.631
to get back to my family,

10:58.698 --> 11:01.061
my... my house, my bed.

11:01.128 --> 11:06.386
Still, I know you were, um... worried
about going too soon.

11:06.453 --> 11:10.613
Well, I-I-I can't say that I... I feel
really ready,

11:10.679 --> 11:12.576
but I'm guessing that's normal.

11:12.643 --> 11:15.272
Absolutely.

11:15.339 --> 11:18.467
Going home's the trickiest part of
recovery.

11:18.534 --> 11:21.295
The last time I went straight home,

11:21.363 --> 11:23.826
I relapsed almost immediately.

11:23.893 --> 11:26.921
I mean, after being here in this
bubble,

11:26.989 --> 11:29.684
it can be a shock to your system.

11:29.751 --> 11:32.013
So this time, I am planning on making a
pit stop.

11:32.081 --> 11:35.275
Well, that seems like a good idea.

11:35.342 --> 11:36.940
My father has a-a cottage

11:37.006 --> 11:38.270
at Lake Arrowhead--

11:38.337 --> 11:40.999
totally remote and empty,

11:41.067 --> 11:42.964
which makes it the perfect halfway
house.

11:43.031 --> 11:44.394
Makes sense.

11:44.462 --> 11:45.792
I mean, if there's one thing we've
learned here,

11:45.860 --> 11:48.422
it's to do things in steps.

11:49.487 --> 11:52.615
You know, there's a lot of extra room.

11:52.683 --> 11:54.513
I-I mean, I know you want to get home,

11:54.580 --> 11:56.910
but if you're having any second
thoughts...

11:58.574 --> 12:00.570
Just think about it.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.600
Thanks.

12:19.275 --> 12:20.839
So, have you heard anything?

12:20.907 --> 12:23.103
About Marissa?

12:23.169 --> 12:25.067
Is there another crisis we're dealing
with?

12:25.134 --> 12:26.398
Of course not, no.

12:26.464 --> 12:28.029
Uh, uh, school hasn't called yet.

12:28.096 --> 12:29.526
So, how was your drink with that
client?

12:29.593 --> 12:31.889
Did you sell him a fleet of yachts?

12:31.957 --> 12:33.986
It was, uh... it was fine.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.450
Look, I-I-I know you're worried

12:35.517 --> 12:36.981
about Marissa, but you never know.

12:37.049 --> 12:38.612
She could catch a break.

12:38.680 --> 12:41.209
Marissa catch a break?

12:41.275 --> 12:42.207
That'd be a first.

12:42.273 --> 12:43.238
I don't know.

12:43.306 --> 12:44.937
Cooper family's been on a bit of a...

12:45.004 --> 12:46.267
lucky streak recently.

12:46.334 --> 12:47.765
My husband died in a pool.

12:47.833 --> 12:49.296
Our daughter's about to be expelled.

12:49.363 --> 12:50.960
What do you define as lucky?

12:51.028 --> 12:53.923
You and I got back together.

12:53.990 --> 12:58.482
And thank God, because it's the only
thing keeping me sane.

13:05.639 --> 13:07.436
I, uh... I-I, um...

13:07.502 --> 13:09.266
left my wallet in the car.

13:09.333 --> 13:09.899
Jimmy.

13:09.966 --> 13:10.930
Can't we just...

13:10.998 --> 13:12.494
put it on Cal's tab?

13:12.561 --> 13:13.759
Yeah, why not?

13:13.826 --> 13:15.855
We've charged a summer's worth of
drinks to him.

13:21.348 --> 13:22.979
Julie Cooper-Nichol.

13:24.011 --> 13:25.441
It's the dean.

13:25.508 --> 13:26.939
Oh, I understand, Dean.

13:27.006 --> 13:31.731
And this decision is final?

13:31.799 --> 13:35.028
Is there any way I can get you to
reconsider?

13:36.191 --> 13:38.954
There'll be an opportunity for appeal?

13:40.286 --> 13:42.448
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

13:42.516 --> 13:45.112
I just want you to know, I...

13:45.178 --> 13:47.675
I think you're making a huge mistake.

13:49.272 --> 13:50.336
Steaks ready?

13:50.404 --> 13:51.469
Shh.

13:51.536 --> 13:53.032
Grilling is an art form, Ryan.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.398
It can't be rushed.

13:56.061 --> 13:57.326
Hey, guys.

13:57.393 --> 13:58.857
SETH: Hey, you want yours rare, Dad?

13:58.925 --> 14:01.153
Sure.

14:01.220 --> 14:02.751
RYAN: What's wrong?

14:02.819 --> 14:04.382
I got some bad news.

14:04.449 --> 14:06.712
I had a meeting at the school today,
and they're concerned

14:06.779 --> 14:08.876
about bringing you and Marissa back
after what happened.

14:10.573 --> 14:11.838
I'm getting kicked out.

14:11.905 --> 14:13.635
No, you're not.

14:14.834 --> 14:16.164
But Marissa is.

14:22.900 --> 14:24.234
"Dirt:

14:24.301 --> 14:26.501
the Motley Crue Story."

14:26.568 --> 14:29.234
Well, that ought to put things in
perspective.

14:29.301 --> 14:32.434
Our son has a very strange take on
self-help.

14:33.568 --> 14:35.267
Oh, how are the boys?

14:35.334 --> 14:36.700
I miss 'em.

14:36.767 --> 14:39.301
They're great. They miss you like
crazy.

14:39.367 --> 14:41.834
But I'm guessing they're going to be
seeing you soon.

14:41.900 --> 14:44.934
Taking that suitcase as a good sign.

14:45.967 --> 14:47.667
I am leaving.

14:47.733 --> 14:48.800
Oh, honey, that's great news.

14:48.867 --> 14:50.000
Your timing couldn't be better.

14:50.067 --> 14:51.000
We cleaned up the house.

14:51.067 --> 14:54.334
It was... it was a pit.

14:54.401 --> 14:57.201
Sandy, I'm not coming home.

14:57.267 --> 14:59.234
I'm going to Lake Arrowhead with a
friend.

15:00.334 --> 15:01.534
A friend?

15:01.600 --> 15:03.267
Her name is Charlotte.

15:03.334 --> 15:04.967
She has a lot of experience

15:05.034 --> 15:07.800
with these things, the dangers of
relapse.

15:08.934 --> 15:10.900
Honey, if you're thinking about
relapse,

15:10.967 --> 15:12.468
w-why check out at all?

15:12.534 --> 15:15.934
I'm not saying that. It's just that...

15:17.000 --> 15:19.034
You don't want to come home. No.

15:20.267 --> 15:22.900
Yes, I want to come home.

15:22.967 --> 15:26.201
Of course I do.

15:26.267 --> 15:30.067
I just need to know that when I do...

15:30.134 --> 15:31.900
that I'm home for good,

15:31.967 --> 15:34.134
that this is all behind me.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.800
Is there a timetable for this?

15:43.867 --> 15:46.501
Oh, Sandy, I don't know.

15:46.568 --> 15:50.700
Well, when you do... call me.

16:05.800 --> 16:06.834
Coop?

16:06.900 --> 16:08.434
Hey.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.401
How you doing?

16:09.468 --> 16:11.034
Oh, I've been better.

16:11.101 --> 16:12.534
Well, we thought, uh, you could use
some breakfast.

16:12.600 --> 16:15.167
We got bagels and a support group.

16:15.234 --> 16:16.301
Yes.

16:16.367 --> 16:17.468
Captain Oats is a really good listener,

16:17.534 --> 16:18.733
but Princess Sparkle--

16:18.800 --> 16:19.967
she just kind of stands there and looks
cute.

16:20.034 --> 16:22.000
Aw, you guys didn't have to do that.

16:22.067 --> 16:23.234
And we're getting you back in.

16:24.633 --> 16:25.800
You shouldn't have to suffer for this.

16:25.867 --> 16:27.000
If anyone has to, it should be me.

16:27.067 --> 16:28.534
Well, you didn't shoot somebody.

16:28.600 --> 16:29.867
I did.

16:29.934 --> 16:31.234
I don't care what it takes.

16:31.301 --> 16:32.501
We're getting you back in.

16:35.301 --> 16:36.401
Hey. Hey.

16:36.468 --> 16:37.501
I'm just checking online.

16:37.568 --> 16:38.800
There's some decent schools in the
area.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.867
And Marissa won't be going to any of
them.

16:40.934 --> 16:41.967
What?

16:42.034 --> 16:44.000
I was just brainstorming during cardio
bar,

16:44.067 --> 16:45.600
which is where I do all my best
thinking,

16:45.667 --> 16:47.534
and I came up with a solution.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.468
Well, uh, I'm all ears.

16:49.534 --> 16:50.534
Money.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.301
Excuse me?

16:52.367 --> 16:54.401
We give Harbor a fat donation,

16:54.468 --> 16:55.568
remind them they're kicking out

16:55.633 --> 16:56.900
Caleb Nichol's stepdaughter.

16:56.967 --> 16:58.667
Except that, um...

16:58.733 --> 17:00.568
uh, Caleb's not around anymore.

17:00.633 --> 17:02.568
Ooh, but his money is-- or at least it
will be

17:02.633 --> 17:04.000
whenever they get around to untangling

17:04.067 --> 17:06.034
his 79 Swiss bank accounts.

17:06.101 --> 17:08.501
I don't know, Jules. I-I don't, uh...

17:08.568 --> 17:09.800
I don't think it's going to work.

17:09.867 --> 17:11.434
Then it's a write-off.

17:11.501 --> 17:14.700
I mean, look, I admit it's a long shot,

17:14.767 --> 17:16.599
but we've got to at least try.

17:16.666 --> 17:19.267
Honey, this is our daughter we're
talking about.

17:21.101 --> 17:23.300
You're right.

17:25.434 --> 17:26.733
So, you write the check.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.134
I'm dry until the will comes through.

17:29.633 --> 17:31.267
Uh...

17:31.334 --> 17:32.600
well, how-how-how much

17:32.667 --> 17:33.967
are you thinking-- like, uh,

17:34.034 --> 17:36.434
$2,000 or three?

17:36.501 --> 17:37.834
Wake up, Jimmy.

17:37.900 --> 17:40.468
The Siegfrieds donated a pool and a
field house.

17:40.534 --> 17:42.000
Their son only smoked pot.

17:42.067 --> 17:43.301
Marissa shot someone.

17:43.367 --> 17:46.834
We've got to at least give them 100
grand.

17:47.867 --> 17:50.568
What happened to Marissa Cooper

17:50.667 --> 17:52.401
is a tragedy...

17:52.468 --> 17:54.700
but let it be a lesson to all of us.

17:54.767 --> 17:59.334
One minute, you're on top; the next,
you're on the streets.

17:59.401 --> 18:02.767
With that in mind, I would like to take
a moment of silence

18:02.834 --> 18:04.434
to remember Marissa Cooper

18:04.501 --> 18:05.900
and the great work she did

18:05.967 --> 18:07.267
as social chair.

18:13.900 --> 18:15.468
That felt really good.

18:15.534 --> 18:18.167
Okay, so, it is with a heavy heart

18:18.234 --> 18:22.834
that I assume Marissa's post as social
chair.

18:24.633 --> 18:25.633
Summer Roberts.

18:25.700 --> 18:28.401
I was just wondering if anyone else,
um,

18:28.468 --> 18:29.867
has a chance to try out.

18:29.934 --> 18:32.867
What, are you saying that you want to
be social chair?

18:32.934 --> 18:34.101
Maybe.

18:36.334 --> 18:39.401
Okay, um... have you ever done

18:39.468 --> 18:40.633
this kind of work before?

18:40.700 --> 18:42.568
Please, no, but... Have you ever done

18:42.633 --> 18:44.633
any extracurricular activities at all?

18:44.700 --> 18:46.667
And remember, shopping doesn't count.

18:46.733 --> 18:50.000
Okay, maybe I'm not, like,
super-qualified,

18:50.067 --> 18:51.434
but neither are you.

18:51.501 --> 18:53.234
Summer, who do you think has been
running this committee

18:53.301 --> 18:54.234
these past few years?

18:54.301 --> 18:55.834
Um, Marissa Cooper.

18:55.900 --> 18:58.934
Marissa Cooper has been busy...

18:59.000 --> 19:03.067
skipping school, experimenting with her
sexual orientation.

19:03.134 --> 19:05.700
And I was here picking up the slack,

19:05.767 --> 19:06.834
doing all of the work

19:06.900 --> 19:08.401
while she got all of the credit.

19:08.468 --> 19:10.534
Do you have any idea what it's like

19:10.600 --> 19:11.934
to have all of the responsibility

19:12.000 --> 19:12.900
and none of the power?

19:12.967 --> 19:15.501
Do you?

19:17.401 --> 19:20.501
Okay, then.

19:22.733 --> 19:24.334
Let's get back to work, people.

19:24.401 --> 19:26.568
We have a carnival to throw.

19:46.434 --> 19:48.733
Charlotte, it's so charming.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.568
Thanks.

19:50.633 --> 19:52.201
God, I haven't been here in years.

19:52.267 --> 19:53.501
We stopped coming here

19:53.568 --> 19:55.034
when Dad bought a house on the
Vineyard.

19:55.101 --> 19:56.733
I always loved it.

19:56.800 --> 19:58.700
Well, that wasn't too important

19:58.767 --> 19:59.700
to dear old Dad.

19:59.767 --> 20:01.301
You know how that is.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.367
But you're here now.

20:03.434 --> 20:04.900
Yeah.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.067
Dad is also a security freak,

20:13.134 --> 20:15.401
so he locks this place up like Fort
Knox.

20:15.468 --> 20:17.301
Ah, there we go.

20:20.867 --> 20:22.434
So this is it.

20:22.501 --> 20:24.401
Oh, and the kitchen is right over
there,

20:24.468 --> 20:25.767
where I will be teaching you to cook

20:25.834 --> 20:27.234
whether you like it or not.

20:32.301 --> 20:35.167
It's beautiful.

20:36.134 --> 20:37.967
Thinking about Sandy?

20:39.934 --> 20:42.600
Can't help it.

20:42.667 --> 20:45.134
I feel like I've let him down yet
again.

20:45.201 --> 20:47.134
You're doing this for him.

20:47.201 --> 20:49.767
I don't think he sees it that way.

20:49.834 --> 20:51.367
Well, then, show him.

20:51.434 --> 20:52.867
Invite him up for dinner.

20:52.934 --> 20:54.067
You really wouldn't mind?

20:54.134 --> 20:55.434
Of course not-- you've been talking so
much

20:55.501 --> 20:57.134
about your perfect husband, I'd love to
meet him.

21:11.633 --> 21:13.067
Ryan.

21:13.134 --> 21:15.067
Dr. Kim, hey, I need to talk to you.

21:15.134 --> 21:17.600
Ryan, the board had an exhaustive
debate

21:17.667 --> 21:19.000
about you and Marissa,

21:19.067 --> 21:20.767
and they came to what I think is a fair
decision.

21:20.834 --> 21:22.134
Okay, but they might change their minds

21:22.201 --> 21:23.468
if they knew what happened.

21:23.534 --> 21:24.568
They do know what happened,

21:24.633 --> 21:26.733
and the board has reached their
decision.

21:26.800 --> 21:28.767
Look, who can I talk to? How can I
change this?

21:29.967 --> 21:31.900
You'd have to talk to the new dean.

21:31.967 --> 21:33.334
This is his department.

21:33.401 --> 21:34.900
Great, so, if Marissa and I could just
talk to him,

21:34.967 --> 21:36.501
tell him our story...

21:40.733 --> 21:42.800
Please?

21:43.867 --> 21:45.167
Hey, you hungry?

21:45.234 --> 21:46.534
I thought we could get a little bite to
eat.

21:46.600 --> 21:47.568
I'm too sick to eat.

21:47.633 --> 21:48.700
Sick?

21:48.767 --> 21:50.733
Yes. This senior year's sucking.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.301
It hasn't even started yet.

21:52.367 --> 21:54.034
So?

21:54.101 --> 21:56.034
It's already terrible.

21:56.101 --> 21:57.367
Marissa got the ax,

21:57.434 --> 21:58.767
and now I have to watch

21:58.834 --> 22:00.534
as uber-bitch feeds on her remains.

22:00.600 --> 22:01.967
You mean that Taylor girl?

22:02.034 --> 22:03.568
You know, I actually thought I could
compete

22:03.633 --> 22:05.167
with psycho-Barbie for social chair.

22:05.234 --> 22:06.600
You wanted to be social chair?

22:06.667 --> 22:08.401
No, it's just all I could do to help,

22:08.468 --> 22:10.367
to try to keep Marissa's legacy from
falling

22:10.434 --> 22:13.067
into the grubby little paws of Taylor
Townsend.

22:13.134 --> 22:14.101
Okay, well, then you should.

22:14.167 --> 22:16.067
I can't; she's Taylor Townsend.

22:16.134 --> 22:18.134
She's like the Karl Rove of our school.

22:18.201 --> 22:20.900
So? You can take Karl Ro... You know
who Karl Rove is?

22:20.967 --> 22:23.334
Yeah. My stepmom sometimes naps in
front of CNN.

22:23.401 --> 22:25.101
I hear things as I'm dragging her off
to bed.

22:25.167 --> 22:26.301
Okay. Well, look,

22:26.367 --> 22:27.834
I know you don't think of yourself as
active.

22:27.900 --> 22:30.401
No. Two hobbies: shopping and
sunbathing.

22:30.468 --> 22:31.767
But you have Marissa as a resource.

22:31.834 --> 22:32.767
Now, you combine that

22:32.834 --> 22:34.401
with your natural, God-given rage,

22:34.468 --> 22:35.568
you have everything you need

22:35.633 --> 22:37.367
to topple that tyrant Taylor Townsend.

22:37.434 --> 22:39.700
You're right. You know what?

22:39.767 --> 22:41.434
We need to go to Marissa's.

22:42.468 --> 22:44.000
Pretty sure I said I was hungry.

22:44.067 --> 22:45.267
Come on!

22:59.101 --> 23:01.967
Jimmy...

23:02.034 --> 23:03.401
you prove me wrong.

23:03.468 --> 23:05.367
I figured you'd be tossing back tequila
shooters

23:05.434 --> 23:06.700
in Oaxaca by now.

23:06.767 --> 23:07.900
I don't have the money.

23:09.934 --> 23:11.234
You're kidding, right?

23:11.301 --> 23:12.267
No.

23:12.334 --> 23:13.633
And, uh, I haven't even gotten

23:13.700 --> 23:15.134
to the unbelievable part yet.

23:15.201 --> 23:18.267
I, uh... I need to ask you for a loan.

23:22.534 --> 23:24.667
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:24.733 --> 23:25.800
You want to borrow money?

23:25.867 --> 23:26.900
Hundred thousand dollars.

23:26.967 --> 23:27.967
It's for my kid.

23:28.034 --> 23:28.967
She's, uh...

23:29.034 --> 23:31.434
she's had, uh, uh, some bad luck.

23:31.501 --> 23:33.067
Well, runs in the family, I guess.

23:33.134 --> 23:35.501
Look, the best way for you to get your
money

23:35.568 --> 23:36.900
is to give me more.

23:36.967 --> 23:38.434
So why don't you sell the boat?

23:38.501 --> 23:40.101
Well, if it were mine...

23:40.167 --> 23:41.600
The bank owns it now.

23:41.667 --> 23:45.334
Look, I-I-I... I-I'm in a real pinch
here.

23:45.401 --> 23:48.267
Once the money comes in, I pay you
back,

23:48.334 --> 23:52.101
Julie and I, we-we-we-we live happily
ever after, okay?

23:52.167 --> 23:54.867
Trust me, I-I-I-I got a plan.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.468
MARISSA: You really think this is gonna
work?

23:59.534 --> 24:02.034
Yeah, well, we got to at least try,
right?

24:07.633 --> 24:10.134
Wow, you must be Ryan and Marissa.

24:10.201 --> 24:13.000
It's good to finally meet Harbor's most
notorious couple.

24:13.067 --> 24:14.700
Please, come in.

24:15.733 --> 24:18.700
Have a seat.

24:21.034 --> 24:22.800
So, uh, we just...

24:22.867 --> 24:25.667
we wanted to tell you our version of
what happened.

24:25.733 --> 24:29.134
This doesn't really concern you, Ryan.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.800
As far as I know, you're still enrolled

24:30.867 --> 24:33.267
at Harbor, despite my best efforts.

24:33.334 --> 24:36.667
So I say we focus on Marissa, hmm?

24:41.568 --> 24:46.101
So... Miss Cooper,

24:46.167 --> 24:48.967
tell me why I'm wrong about you.

24:49.034 --> 24:52.267
Uh...

24:52.334 --> 24:53.501
I, uh...

24:53.568 --> 24:55.334
Because that's what this is about,
right?

24:56.334 --> 24:58.034
I've got you all wrong?

24:58.101 --> 24:59.633
I don't know.

24:59.700 --> 25:01.101
I just know I've never been involved

25:01.167 --> 25:02.633
in anything like this before.

25:02.700 --> 25:03.800
Really?

25:03.867 --> 25:05.201
Well, I got to disagree with you.

25:05.267 --> 25:06.733
What are you talking about?

25:06.800 --> 25:08.800
You know, I'm new to Newport.

25:08.867 --> 25:11.633
I moved here a few weeks ago from the
East Coast.

25:11.700 --> 25:13.667
So far, it's not bad.

25:13.733 --> 25:14.967
The weather's great.

25:15.034 --> 25:17.134
And, you know what else I like about it
here?

25:17.201 --> 25:18.367
People here talk.

25:18.434 --> 25:20.367
They love to talk,

25:20.434 --> 25:21.700
especially about you.

25:21.767 --> 25:23.834
You can't buy into the gossip in this
town.

25:23.900 --> 25:25.334
All right.

25:25.401 --> 25:28.568
So... yeah, you tell me, then.

25:28.633 --> 25:31.568
Shoplifting, alcohol abuse,

25:31.633 --> 25:33.401
an overdose in Tijuana...

25:33.468 --> 25:35.800
And, please, stop me if any of this is
just gossip.

25:35.867 --> 25:36.900
Those things have nothing

25:36.967 --> 25:38.000
to do with what happened with Trey.

25:38.067 --> 25:39.134
You know what?

25:39.201 --> 25:40.034
I did do those things,

25:40.101 --> 25:41.501
but, I mean,

25:41.568 --> 25:42.967
the shooting was different.

25:43.034 --> 25:45.501
Marissa, it's never different.

25:45.568 --> 25:47.534
A troubled kid gets a hold of a gun,

25:47.600 --> 25:49.468
the ending is always the same.

25:49.534 --> 25:50.900
I'm not troubled.

25:50.967 --> 25:52.334
You almost killed another kid.

25:52.401 --> 25:54.700
I don't even hear a hint of remorse in
your voice.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.468
Because I don't have any.

26:00.167 --> 26:02.234
I'm proud of what I did, and I'd do it
again.

26:02.301 --> 26:03.900
So, you know what?

26:03.967 --> 26:05.301
Maybe the next time you're out

26:05.367 --> 26:07.101
on the town talking with people,

26:07.167 --> 26:08.800
you should tell them I said that.

26:11.834 --> 26:13.767
Huh.

26:13.834 --> 26:17.600
I hope she gets a good, long look on
her way out.

26:23.201 --> 26:26.134
All the California fire codes are in
here... I think.

26:26.201 --> 26:27.134
Want to test me?

26:27.201 --> 26:29.201
Oh. No.

26:29.267 --> 26:30.301
What? Cohen, come on.

26:30.367 --> 26:31.967
I have to catch Taylor breaking a rule.

26:32.034 --> 26:34.234
Otherwise, I have no shot at taking
back this carnival.

26:34.301 --> 26:36.134
Well, you know, you're not going to
out-Taylor Taylor.

26:36.201 --> 26:37.534
I mean, fire codes and regulations--

26:37.601 --> 26:38.634
that's her bread and butter.

26:38.700 --> 26:40.833
Well, what do you suggest?

26:40.900 --> 26:42.034
I suggest you find something

26:42.100 --> 26:44.000
that you're good at that she's not.

26:45.100 --> 26:47.301
Hey, dude, you want to play?

26:47.367 --> 26:48.634
More in the mood for stewing.

26:48.700 --> 26:50.334
I got it.

26:50.401 --> 26:51.634
You should go talk to him.

26:52.733 --> 26:54.733
Go talk to him.

26:57.401 --> 26:58.534
SETH: You okay?

26:58.601 --> 26:59.800
Not really.

26:59.867 --> 27:01.167
Look, I know this thing with the dean

27:01.234 --> 27:02.534
has you a little pissed off...

27:03.800 --> 27:05.201
...or a lot. Was all I could do to keep

27:05.267 --> 27:06.201
from kicking that guy's ass.

27:06.267 --> 27:07.867
I know how it feels.

27:07.934 --> 27:09.334
Actually, I don't, but you don't do

27:09.401 --> 27:10.668
that kind of thing anymore, right?

27:10.733 --> 27:12.000
Sometimes, like right now,

27:12.067 --> 27:13.367
it seems like the best way to handle
things.

27:13.434 --> 27:14.634
I don't like where this is headed.

27:14.700 --> 27:15.867
Yeah, well...

27:15.934 --> 27:17.301
Okay, well, listen.

27:17.367 --> 27:20.134
I mean, even if you can't get Marissa
back into school,

27:20.201 --> 27:22.100
all right, at least she's not going to
jail.

27:22.167 --> 27:23.967
It's not the end of the world.

27:26.568 --> 27:29.501
Voila! $100,000.

27:29.568 --> 27:31.767
Oh, thanks, but I don't think we're
going to need it.

27:31.833 --> 27:32.967
We don't?

27:33.034 --> 27:35.501
Marissa had a meeting with the dean
yesterday.

27:35.568 --> 27:37.334
Apparently, she showed him a side of
herself

27:37.401 --> 27:38.800
she usually reserves for me.

27:38.867 --> 27:40.167
Oh, it was that bad, huh?

27:40.234 --> 27:41.833
I don't think any amount of money

27:41.900 --> 27:43.800
is getting her back in that school.

27:43.867 --> 27:45.668
Oh, I'm sorry.

27:45.733 --> 27:48.000
Well, at least we found out now.

27:48.067 --> 27:50.301
Saves us some money.

27:50.367 --> 27:52.668
Actually... I could use this.

27:52.733 --> 27:53.833
What?

27:53.900 --> 27:55.501
Well, you know, the landscaper,

27:55.568 --> 27:57.301
the pool guy, the gardener...

27:57.367 --> 27:59.167
I mean, none of them have been paid
since Caleb died.

27:59.234 --> 28:02.501
I'm afraid one of them's going to kill
me in my sleep.

28:04.867 --> 28:06.668
Okay, next, I've got

28:06.733 --> 28:08.767
your stations set up right here.

28:08.833 --> 28:10.467
Summer.

28:10.534 --> 28:12.167
You showed up,

28:12.234 --> 28:13.934
and, um, you brought a little friend.

28:15.534 --> 28:16.934
Seth Cohen, is it?

28:17.000 --> 28:17.800
Present.

28:17.867 --> 28:19.534
So, as I was saying...

28:19.601 --> 28:20.767
Uh, we had some ideas,

28:20.833 --> 28:22.134
so we came to help.

28:22.201 --> 28:25.100
Oh, well, that's sweet, but we've got
it under control.

28:25.167 --> 28:26.501
Hmm. All right. Well, all right. Gotta
go.

28:26.568 --> 28:27.833
TAYLOR: So, as I was saying... Hey,
Ash.

28:28.668 --> 28:29.534
Hmm?

28:29.601 --> 28:30.700
Um, what would you think

28:30.767 --> 28:31.501
about getting a chocolate fountain?

28:31.568 --> 28:32.668
That would be awesome.

28:32.733 --> 28:33.900
Didn't Britney have one at her wedding?

28:33.967 --> 28:35.467
SUMMER: You know what?

28:35.534 --> 28:38.000
She did. And, uh, Seth and I here
rented one for tonight.

28:38.067 --> 28:40.000
Well, sorry, Summer.

28:40.067 --> 28:41.601
That's not really our carnival.

28:41.668 --> 28:42.434
Well, it should be.

28:42.501 --> 28:43.167
GIRL: Totally.

28:43.234 --> 28:44.267
What else?

28:44.334 --> 28:45.501
Well, I was thinking,

28:45.568 --> 28:48.434
for food-- how 'bout, like,
mini-burgers,

28:48.501 --> 28:49.733
mini-dim sum,

28:49.800 --> 28:51.833
maybe, like, mini-soups in little shot
glasses.

28:51.900 --> 28:52.800
SETH: Yeah.

28:52.867 --> 28:54.167
SUMMER: How cute is that?

28:54.234 --> 28:56.100
Because mini is the new super-size.

28:56.167 --> 28:57.034
So true.

28:57.100 --> 28:57.867
We should also maybe cancel,

28:57.934 --> 28:59.234
uh, Shenanigans...

28:59.301 --> 29:01.434
What? I'm telling you, the Harbor
Comedy Troupe's

29:01.501 --> 29:02.733
gotten way too political lately.

29:02.800 --> 29:05.334
Ever since Tina Woo left, they are so
not funny.

29:05.401 --> 29:06.900
You know what-- and why are we raffling
off

29:06.967 --> 29:11.167
a gas-guzzling SUV-- ugh-- from
Taylor's dad's dealership--

29:11.234 --> 29:12.467
when we could give away a Hybrid?

29:12.534 --> 29:13.700
GIRL: That's a great idea.

29:13.767 --> 29:15.000
Air quality is so important.

29:15.067 --> 29:16.467
I know. We breathe it.

29:16.534 --> 29:18.301
GIRL: Totally. All right, you guys,

29:18.367 --> 29:21.134
so who is on board with my carnival?

29:48.467 --> 29:51.733
Hey, you must be Sandy Cohen.

29:51.800 --> 29:53.733
Bit of a legend back at Suriak.

29:53.800 --> 29:55.501
Thanks, Charlotte, and nice to meet
you, too.

29:55.568 --> 29:56.733
Kirsten's just up in the kitchen.

29:56.800 --> 29:59.234
You left her unsupervised?

29:59.301 --> 30:00.568
Consider it therapy.

30:00.634 --> 30:02.733
Boy, everything seems to be therapy
nowadays--

30:02.800 --> 30:05.367
cooking, holing yourself up in the
woods...

30:05.434 --> 30:07.067
This place has been great for Kirsten.

30:07.134 --> 30:10.134
What would be great for Kirsten is for
her to be with her kids.

30:10.201 --> 30:12.867
Look, Sandy, I know you don't know me,

30:12.934 --> 30:15.334
and I know this all seems a little
weird,

30:15.401 --> 30:18.434
but I've been around this track a few
times.

30:18.501 --> 30:19.900
I'm not proud of that,

30:19.967 --> 30:21.934
but at least I've learned a few things.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.534
And I know that the reason Kirsten was
in rehab

30:23.601 --> 30:25.201
in the first place is 'cause she spent
the better part

30:25.267 --> 30:26.700
of her life trying to be the perfect
daughter.

30:26.767 --> 30:29.000
So now if she tries to be the perfect
mother

30:29.067 --> 30:31.267
and the perfect wife...

30:33.733 --> 30:35.568
She may never come home.

30:38.234 --> 30:39.934
I'm so glad you're here.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.900
Oh, I am, too.

30:50.467 --> 30:52.934
Okay, who wants dinner?

30:59.501 --> 31:01.267
Hi.

31:01.334 --> 31:03.634
Hey, why aren't you at the carnival?

31:03.700 --> 31:07.034
Because I was hoping I could get you to
go with me.

31:07.100 --> 31:09.867
Seth and Summer are there. It'll be
fun.

31:09.934 --> 31:12.700
Or really depressing.

31:13.733 --> 31:15.867
Look, um, about that...

31:15.934 --> 31:17.434
It's not over yet.

31:17.501 --> 31:18.534
I'm going to talk to Sandy,

31:18.601 --> 31:20.301
maybe get him a copy of our
testimonies.

31:20.367 --> 31:21.401
Right.

31:21.467 --> 31:22.568
If you're innocent of all the charges,

31:22.634 --> 31:23.700
then they're going to have to admit

31:23.767 --> 31:24.767
you shouldn't be punished, right?

31:24.833 --> 31:27.334
No. No. It's over.

31:27.401 --> 31:28.301
I don't get it.

31:28.367 --> 31:29.568
Why don't you want to fight this?

31:29.634 --> 31:31.800
Because I can't keep doing this, okay?

31:31.867 --> 31:33.833
Look, I appreciate everything

31:33.900 --> 31:35.700
you've done to help me,

31:35.767 --> 31:37.201
but maybe you've done enough.

31:38.434 --> 31:40.267
Well, what is that supposed to mean?

31:40.334 --> 31:41.601
I don't need you to help me.

31:41.668 --> 31:43.334
I don't need you to protect me.

31:43.401 --> 31:47.067
I don't now, and I didn't then.

31:47.134 --> 31:49.267
Oh, what, so this whole thing is my
fault?

31:49.334 --> 31:50.833
Look, what happened was between me and
Trey.

31:50.900 --> 31:52.367
You didn't need to get in the middle of
it.

31:52.434 --> 31:54.700
So I was supposed to watch you die?

31:55.767 --> 31:58.234
I did what I did,

31:58.301 --> 32:00.467
and I'm prepared to face the
consequences.

32:00.534 --> 32:02.501
Yeah, well, there are consequences for
me, too.

32:02.568 --> 32:03.501
He was my brother.

32:05.134 --> 32:06.534
Right.

32:06.601 --> 32:09.067
And now, because of me, he's gone.

32:12.800 --> 32:15.100
No, that's not what I mean.

32:20.067 --> 32:21.067
Ryan...

32:41.900 --> 32:43.234
And the winner

32:43.301 --> 32:46.900
of the Toyota Highlander Hybrid is
Jillian Flynn!

32:46.967 --> 32:48.434
I won! I won!

32:49.601 --> 32:52.234
All right, you won. Cool. Yeah.

32:52.301 --> 32:53.434
GIRL: Hey, Summer.

32:53.501 --> 32:54.601
Totally awesome carnival.

32:54.668 --> 32:56.267
We love the mini-burgers.

32:56.334 --> 32:58.534
And, high five for taking down Taylor.

32:58.601 --> 33:00.067
Thanks, guys.

33:00.134 --> 33:01.000
See you later.

33:01.067 --> 33:02.967
Bye. Have fun.

33:04.800 --> 33:07.601
Hey... why the sad face?

33:07.668 --> 33:09.100
This is your Rudy moment.

33:09.167 --> 33:11.601
I know, I just... I can't enjoy it, not
without Coop.

33:11.668 --> 33:12.434
No?

33:12.501 --> 33:14.067
No.

33:14.134 --> 33:16.668
We're never going to go back to the way
things were, are we?

33:16.734 --> 33:18.100
I don't know.

33:18.167 --> 33:20.067
I mean, you worked too hard on this
carnival to miss out on it.

33:20.134 --> 33:21.134
I know, but, Cohen...

33:21.200 --> 33:22.234
All right, come on.

33:22.301 --> 33:23.567
One mournful ride on the Tilt-a-Whirl

33:23.634 --> 33:25.034
is the least we could do.

33:30.768 --> 33:32.701
I thought you'd be at the carnival.

33:32.768 --> 33:34.501
Didn't really work out.

33:35.501 --> 33:37.367
So I guess Marissa's expulsion

33:37.434 --> 33:38.967
hasn't been easy on you two, huh?

33:39.034 --> 33:41.434
Yeah. I just wish there was something I
could do.

33:41.501 --> 33:43.501
So you want to fix this?

33:43.567 --> 33:46.067
The universal male instinct.

33:46.134 --> 33:49.334
Happens to the best of us.

33:49.401 --> 33:51.534
So, what, I'm supposed to sit here and
do nothing?

33:51.601 --> 33:52.833
No, you need to go back...

33:52.900 --> 33:55.967
and just listen.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.634
Just listen.

33:57.701 --> 34:00.534
Trust me. It works better than you
think.

34:04.634 --> 34:06.000
Um, could we...

34:06.067 --> 34:08.768
could we get another bottle of, uh, Dom
Perignon?

34:08.833 --> 34:09.900
Mm. Ah.

34:09.967 --> 34:12.234
Okay, Daddy Warbucks.

34:12.301 --> 34:13.768
What's the occasion?

34:13.833 --> 34:15.933
What, can't I take you out to a nice
little dinner?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.034
Sure. It's just that I thought we
agreed

34:18.100 --> 34:20.199
that tonight was Taco Bell

34:20.266 --> 34:22.134
and Dancing With the Stars.

34:22.199 --> 34:23.634
Well, I brought you here

34:23.701 --> 34:26.199
because I wanted to tell you that I...

34:26.266 --> 34:28.501
am never leaving this family again.

34:29.501 --> 34:32.100
I lost you once, Julie, and I...

34:32.167 --> 34:35.367
I'm never going to let that happen
again.

34:36.434 --> 34:38.734
James...

34:38.800 --> 34:45.100
And, um... with that... in mind...

34:51.199 --> 34:52.567
My old ring.

35:01.701 --> 35:04.634
Will you marry me, Julie?

35:04.701 --> 35:06.534
Again?

35:07.534 --> 35:10.034
Of course.

35:33.167 --> 35:35.334
Want some company?

35:36.367 --> 35:38.567
Sure.

35:46.668 --> 35:49.200
Sorry about before.

35:51.034 --> 35:53.067
I know.

36:02.067 --> 36:04.000
You know...

36:04.067 --> 36:05.301
I was always worried

36:05.367 --> 36:07.800
that I'd screw things up for myself
here,

36:07.867 --> 36:10.701
get in trouble.

36:10.768 --> 36:13.301
Ruin the chance the Cohens gave me.

36:15.768 --> 36:17.734
And now I screwed things up for you.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.167
Ryan... I'm not going to let

36:20.234 --> 36:22.267
getting kicked out of Harbor ruin my
life,

36:22.334 --> 36:24.833
and I'm not even going to let it ruin
my year.

36:24.900 --> 36:28.434
Look... I know that we're not in school
together anymore,

36:28.501 --> 36:30.301
but at least we still have

36:30.367 --> 36:32.668
this last year in Newport together.

36:34.833 --> 36:37.034
I'm listening.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.601
Thank you. Thanks.

36:46.668 --> 36:49.267
Oh! How you feeling?

36:49.334 --> 36:52.267
My stomach is far too Jewish for that
ride,

36:52.334 --> 36:54.967
but I'm almost done spinning.

37:04.567 --> 37:05.933
Summer.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Hi.

37:08.067 --> 37:09.167
I just wanted to thank you

37:09.234 --> 37:12.301
for all your little touches on the
carnival.

37:12.367 --> 37:14.167
It's just... it's really sad

37:14.234 --> 37:16.534
that Marissa Cooper couldn't be here to
see this.

37:16.601 --> 37:19.501
Must be hard having your friend
ostracized from school.

37:19.567 --> 37:21.301
Okay, Taylor, number one,

37:21.367 --> 37:23.734
Marissa was not ostra... whatever.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.100
Ostracized.

37:25.167 --> 37:26.200
Number two, she happens

37:26.267 --> 37:27.200
to be on her way right now.

37:27.267 --> 37:28.867
Marissa's coming here?

37:28.933 --> 37:29.668
Oh, I'm not done yet.

37:29.734 --> 37:30.701
And number three...

37:30.768 --> 37:32.067
Do we have a number three?

37:32.134 --> 37:33.401
Oh, yeah we do.

37:33.467 --> 37:35.234
Number three: This is the best carnival

37:35.301 --> 37:36.467
this school has ever seen,

37:36.534 --> 37:38.534
and not just because I canceled
Shenanigans.

37:38.601 --> 37:39.534
Yeah.

37:39.601 --> 37:41.200
Yeah. Come on, Cohen.

37:47.567 --> 37:50.534
I didn't know Marissa was coming.

37:50.601 --> 37:52.701
Me neither. Coop?

37:52.768 --> 37:53.734
Hey.

37:53.800 --> 37:54.967
Hey.

37:55.034 --> 37:57.200
Oh, I couldn't miss your first Kickoff
Carnival.

37:57.267 --> 37:58.567
Not bad, huh?

37:58.634 --> 38:00.067
I couldn't have done it better myself.

38:00.134 --> 38:02.134
So, can I interest you in the Ferris
wheel?

38:02.200 --> 38:02.967
Cool.

38:03.034 --> 38:04.134
Mm.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.967
What were you saying?

38:23.967 --> 38:26.034
Charlotte?

38:27.134 --> 38:29.734
Charlotte? What's wrong?

38:29.800 --> 38:31.734
I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

38:31.800 --> 38:34.501
No, no, no, I was up. What's the
matter?

38:34.567 --> 38:38.334
Um...

38:38.401 --> 38:40.100
I haven't...

38:40.167 --> 38:42.867
I haven't been totally honest with you.

38:44.634 --> 38:46.267
There's something I need to tell you.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.701
I haven't yet, but I might.

39:01.768 --> 39:03.900
It's okay.

39:03.967 --> 39:05.200
What am I going to do when you're gone?

39:05.267 --> 39:08.200
I can't do this without you.

39:08.267 --> 39:09.601
I saw you with Sandy,

39:09.668 --> 39:11.601
and I know how much you miss him...

39:11.668 --> 39:12.967
and you're going to leave soon,

39:13.034 --> 39:14.567
and what am I going to do?

39:16.367 --> 39:19.634
I'm not going anywhere until you tell
me you're ready.

39:19.701 --> 39:21.900
We're in this together.

39:35.100 --> 39:36.900
Thank you.

39:36.967 --> 39:39.100
Let's go to bed. You'll feel better in
the morning.

39:40.100 --> 39:42.701
I'll be right behind you.

40:11.734 --> 40:12.833
Okay, I'm nauseous again.

40:12.900 --> 40:15.534
Ryan, I-I'm feeling queasy!

40:15.601 --> 40:16.933
Cohen, will you leave them alone?

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
They're having a moment.

40:18.067 --> 40:19.267
I just want to warn you

40:19.334 --> 40:21.134
in case that dim sum resurfaces,

40:21.200 --> 40:23.034
you're kind of in the line of fire.

40:24.933 --> 40:26.334
You're getting good at this, aren't
you?

40:26.401 --> 40:28.334
Eh... third year's a charm.

40:30.200 --> 40:32.833
Look, I, uh, I know the last three
years

40:32.900 --> 40:34.933
haven't exactly been perfect, and I
know

40:35.000 --> 40:36.668
that this year's going to be even
tougher,

40:36.734 --> 40:39.534
but... we just got to find our moments,
you know?

40:39.601 --> 40:41.900
Well, I think we're having one now.

40:41.967 --> 40:43.768
Ah.

40:46.701 --> 40:48.334
Excuse me, Miss Cooper.

40:48.401 --> 40:50.134
What do you think you're doing?

40:50.200 --> 40:51.100
Taylor Townsend.

40:51.167 --> 40:52.501
She is Karl Rove!

40:52.567 --> 40:53.800
We're not on school property.

40:53.867 --> 40:54.900
She's here as my guest.

40:54.967 --> 40:56.234
This doesn't involve you, Ryan!

40:56.301 --> 40:57.567
I want you out of here right now!

40:57.634 --> 40:59.234
Fine, okay? I'm leaving.

40:59.301 --> 41:00.668
No, no, you're not going anywhere.

41:00.734 --> 41:02.668
Look, she worked on this carnival every
year at Harbor.

41:02.734 --> 41:04.768
Thanks for the trip down memory lane,

41:04.833 --> 41:06.000
but that is not my problem.

41:06.067 --> 41:07.301
Now, get out of here!

41:07.367 --> 41:08.167
Ow!

41:08.234 --> 41:09.734
Hey, get your hands off of her!

41:09.800 --> 41:11.067
Another word, you're out of this
school.

41:11.134 --> 41:11.867
MARISSA: Get off of me!

41:11.933 --> 41:12.601
Hey, hey!

41:12.668 --> 41:13.567
Don't touch her!

41:13.634 --> 41:14.301
MARISSA: Ryan!

41:15.800 --> 41:17.234
Oh, my God! That's not good.

41:26.668 --> 41:28.534
Well, this is my lucky day.

41:28.601 --> 41:30.367
Here, I thought

41:30.434 --> 41:34.501
I was going to have to work to throw
you out of this school...
