WEBVTT

00:14.083 --> 00:15.125
I'm listening.

00:16.666 --> 00:17.500
<i>Good.</i>

00:17.500 --> 00:20.000
<i>Be at the Griffith Observatory
in 30 minutes.</i>

00:20.000 --> 00:21.500
<i>Come alone.</i>

00:33.708 --> 00:35.166
<i>Go to the gift shop.</i>

00:35.166 --> 00:38.458
<i>Buy a snow globe,
a keychain, and a cherry Blow Pop.</i>

00:38.458 --> 00:40.666
-  Blow Pop?
-  <i>Just do it.</i>

00:41.291 --> 00:44.250
<i>Then go to the far left elevator
and take it to the basement.</i>

00:45.125 --> 00:46.333
I'd take the next one.

00:51.375 --> 00:53.458
<i>Welcome, Mr. Presley.</i>

01:00.083 --> 01:01.250
You're late, Mr. Presley.

01:01.250 --> 01:02.916
Well, it's a hell of a commute.

01:03.416 --> 01:05.166
And eight bucks for a snow globe?

01:05.166 --> 01:07.625
Yeah. We make a killing off that stuff.

01:07.625 --> 01:11.791
By the way, not really
what I was picturing for a headquarters.

01:11.791 --> 01:13.958
Oh, this? No, this is just the room

01:13.958 --> 01:17.333
where we murder people
who try to break into the headquarters.

01:17.333 --> 01:20.083
You have a problem
with our methods, Agent King?

01:21.583 --> 01:24.875
Well, believe it or not,
I don't really like being called "King."

01:24.875 --> 01:27.833
Well, it's a little late
for that kind of input,

01:27.833 --> 01:29.833
because I already made this.

01:31.250 --> 01:33.666
It's out of my hands.
The sticker makes it official.

01:42.250 --> 01:44.708
Yeah. Shocked silence. That's right.

01:46.166 --> 01:48.250
Welcome to TCB Headquarters.

01:58.416 --> 02:01.500
This is the beating heart of TCB.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.833
From here, we operate in the shadows.

02:03.833 --> 02:05.208
Mm-hmm.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.750
That's pretty damn big shadows.

02:07.750 --> 02:09.916
 Yeah, she's a beaut.

02:09.916 --> 02:13.000
Ten stories beneath the Hollywood sign,
impervious to nukes,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.541
and completely fireproof
thanks to the asbestos,

02:15.541 --> 02:18.666
which we recently learned
was a poor choice.

02:18.666 --> 02:19.583
Problem?

02:19.583 --> 02:22.458
Nah! Not for about 40 years,
which would put you in your seventies,

02:22.458 --> 02:24.583
and who wants to live forever, am I right?

02:24.583 --> 02:26.625
We call this the Eye.

02:26.625 --> 02:28.708
From here, we watch the world.

02:28.708 --> 02:30.666
Just yesterday, I watched H Chí Minh

02:30.666 --> 02:33.583
order an off-menu fish entrée
at a bistro in Hanoi.

02:33.583 --> 02:35.708
Well, that's, uh, pretty specific.

02:35.708 --> 02:37.125
So was he, actually.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.833
And here's our weapons testing range.

02:41.375 --> 02:44.166
Speaking of,
watch out for these blast doors.

02:44.166 --> 02:46.041
They'll cut a toe clean off.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.291
- Gregory Peck learned that the hard way.

02:48.291 --> 02:49.583
Twice, actually.

02:50.125 --> 02:52.125
Turns out he's kind of a moron.

02:52.958 --> 02:55.458
-  What the hell is that?
-  Good eye, cowboy.

02:55.458 --> 02:57.041
We call that the Pit.

02:57.041 --> 02:58.875
No roughhousing near that thing.

02:58.875 --> 03:00.583
Lost a few guys last month.

03:00.583 --> 03:02.041
Well, you could put a cover on it.

03:02.041 --> 03:04.833
 Put a cov... Put a cover?

03:04.833 --> 03:06.500
Then why even have one?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.291
What the hell was that?

03:12.708 --> 03:14.125
 Fucking Robert.

03:14.625 --> 03:19.083
So, I assume I've got an office
around here somewhere, Commander?

03:19.083 --> 03:20.583
- Uh, not yet.
- Good.

03:21.166 --> 03:22.916
Then we can get it right the first time.

03:23.416 --> 03:24.916
Gonna need something big.

03:24.916 --> 03:26.500
Uh, your office will probably do.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.541
I'm also gonna need a TV budget.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.583
Mine tend to get shot a whole bunch.

03:30.583 --> 03:32.375
- And speaking of guns--
- Uh, know what?

03:32.375 --> 03:35.791
That's something you should
probably take up with your supervisor.

03:35.791 --> 03:37.083
Uh...

03:38.083 --> 03:39.000
My what?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.083
Did you bring the Blow Pop?

03:41.958 --> 03:43.166
Nice!

03:43.750 --> 03:45.416
Creepy as shit, right?

03:45.416 --> 03:49.166
Mr. Presley, say hello
to your Agent in Charge.

03:49.166 --> 03:51.250
This is gonna be fun.

03:51.250 --> 03:54.208
Yeah... Not gonna happen.

03:54.791 --> 03:56.750
Aw. Sad face.

03:56.750 --> 03:58.666
Oh, she being in charge of me?

03:59.250 --> 04:00.083
Ha!

04:00.083 --> 04:01.666
Gonna pretend I didn't hear that.

04:01.666 --> 04:03.916
Mm, that's a good one.
I do that all the time too.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.083
You gonna sit? For the briefing?

04:07.083 --> 04:08.958
Not really my style.

04:08.958 --> 04:10.166
Easier to take notes.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.791
Also not my style.

04:11.791 --> 04:14.458
Seems like a weirdly stubborn style.

04:14.458 --> 04:15.625
Now you're getting it.

04:15.625 --> 04:17.458
I don't enjoy public speaking.

04:17.458 --> 04:21.125
I've been told, however,
picturing your audience naked can help.

04:21.625 --> 04:22.916
So...

04:29.041 --> 04:30.166
Problem?

04:30.166 --> 04:31.416
Not anymore.

04:31.416 --> 04:33.125
So, down to business.

04:33.125 --> 04:36.208
We gonna talk about that shitshow
that went down at Altamont?

04:36.208 --> 04:38.750
- Later.
- Because that device you sent us to find

04:38.750 --> 04:40.625
turned that concert into a bloodbath.

04:40.625 --> 04:43.666
Jesus. People bleed, okay?
No time for that right now.

04:43.666 --> 04:45.125
We have a bit of an emergency.

04:45.125 --> 04:48.208
A file that threatens
to expose the existence of TCB

04:48.208 --> 04:50.166
has fallen into enemy hands.

04:50.166 --> 04:51.625
You two are gonna get it back.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.500
Piece of cake.
Ooh, that sounds good. Yes, please.

04:54.500 --> 04:57.625
And we need to get
the file before this asshole reads it.

04:57.625 --> 05:01.125
Huh. Okay. Slightly trickier cake.

05:01.125 --> 05:04.750
Now I'm gonna assume that
you just got your slides swapped here,

05:04.750 --> 05:09.125
and you just didn't insult the President
of the greatest country in the world.

05:09.125 --> 05:10.083
What, Costa Rica?

05:10.083 --> 05:11.750
I'm partial to Portugal.

05:11.750 --> 05:15.000
In any case, at 1600 hours and 32 minutes,

05:15.000 --> 05:18.458
that file will land on Nixon's desk
in his private residence.

05:18.458 --> 05:20.708
You two need to get it before he does.

05:20.708 --> 05:22.083
Heh. Uh-huh.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.291
And by "get it," you mean
"break into the White House"?

05:25.291 --> 05:28.708
Yeah, fuck, break in, blow up, freeze ray.
You know, work out the details.

05:28.708 --> 05:30.166
It's not gonna happen, ace.

05:30.750 --> 05:33.041
And you're not gonna
change my mind with a stare.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.458
Oh no, sorry, I...

05:35.458 --> 05:38.125
I was just trying to remember
who you remind me of naked.

05:38.125 --> 05:39.958
- What?
- Loving the weird energy right now.

05:41.125 --> 05:43.041
<i>Sir, we have a situation.</i>

05:43.041 --> 05:44.291
Words. Go.

05:44.958 --> 05:47.875
Yeah, well, there's a tiny chance
there's part of a finger in it,

05:47.875 --> 05:49.000
so you're gonna have to--

05:49.000 --> 05:52.416
How the fuck should I know why
a chocolate volcano overflows? It should...

05:52.416 --> 05:54.083
It should be fucking finger-proof!

05:54.083 --> 05:59.291
I don't have a goddamn PhD
in fucking chocolate volcanos!

05:59.291 --> 06:01.208
Oh yeah? Well, you know what?

06:01.208 --> 06:03.416
I'm gonna come over there
and rip your fucking dick off,

06:03.416 --> 06:05.000
shove it in the top of the volcano,

06:05.000 --> 06:07.041
then we're gonna see
how this goddamn thing goes...

06:07.041 --> 06:07.958
Hang on a second.

06:07.958 --> 06:10.708
Why are you guys still here?
Please go do what I asked you.

06:10.708 --> 06:13.875
Uh, listen up, Commander.
I'm not stealing from the President.

06:13.875 --> 06:15.958
It's not stealing if it's not his.

06:15.958 --> 06:19.041
Same way it's not murder
if you do it with your eyes closed.

06:19.041 --> 06:20.125
Now go.

06:21.041 --> 06:25.083
Sinatra. Naked, Sinatra.
Neck down, you're Sinatra. That's it.

06:28.458 --> 06:30.375
Ugh, what do you want?

06:30.375 --> 06:32.000
Uh, bad time?

06:32.000 --> 06:36.791
Uh, not if your lungs are impervious
to DNA-altering nanobots.

06:36.791 --> 06:38.250
Let's pretend they aren't.

06:38.250 --> 06:42.416
Then I'd pretend to make it very quick
and only breathe out.

06:42.416 --> 06:44.666
Okay. Anyway, got a mission. Set us up?

06:44.666 --> 06:45.875
Ooh!

06:45.875 --> 06:49.541
So, what'll it be?
Shooters? Melters? Exploders?

06:49.541 --> 06:53.750
Ooh, we got some new screamers in.
Or if you're feeling a little more...

06:55.916 --> 06:56.916
hands-on?

06:56.916 --> 06:58.708
It's a non-lethal mission, Howard.

06:58.708 --> 07:02.416
Well, why didn't you say so?
I would've completely tuned you out.

07:02.416 --> 07:04.208
I can turn off my ears, you know.

07:04.208 --> 07:07.208
Experiment gone wrong. Or... right.

07:07.208 --> 07:09.125
- Howard, just--
-  Ugh, fine.

07:09.125 --> 07:11.125
Ooh! Wait! New idea.

07:11.125 --> 07:12.708
Have you seen the new tranquilizer gun?

07:13.291 --> 07:17.291
Metal detectors don't pick it up,
and it causes total memory loss.

07:17.291 --> 07:18.750
Ow! Shit!

07:19.333 --> 07:20.916
Goddamn!

07:21.416 --> 07:23.208
Ugh! What do you two want?

07:24.583 --> 07:26.916
Okay. Guess we're off to DC.

07:26.916 --> 07:30.333
Yep. And your flight
leaves LAX in an hour.

07:30.916 --> 07:32.583
Well, now, hang on a second.

07:33.083 --> 07:36.708
Don't you have some kind
of badass spy plane that we can use?

07:36.708 --> 07:38.750
Of course we do.
Don't be stupid. I'll be on that.

07:38.750 --> 07:42.458
But the Commander wants us to keep up
appearances, so you'll be flying...

07:52.750 --> 07:53.583
Wait a minute.

07:53.583 --> 07:58.416
So, you want me to help you break into
the second-greatest home in America,

07:58.416 --> 08:00.916
and I don't even get
any kickass spy gadgets?

08:00.916 --> 08:02.083
Come on, CeCe.

08:02.083 --> 08:03.833
Look, I signed for the tranq gun,

08:03.833 --> 08:06.291
and the paperwork trolls
are so anal it's weird.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.666
Fine.

08:08.666 --> 08:09.708
Here. Take this.

08:09.708 --> 08:12.833
There we go, there we go,
there we go, there we go.

08:14.583 --> 08:17.166
Now we're cookin', CeCe with an E.
What's it do?

08:17.166 --> 08:18.958
How the fuck should I know?
I didn't make it.

08:18.958 --> 08:20.125
Say cheese!

08:20.125 --> 08:22.250
-  Yeah. Okay.

08:22.250 --> 08:25.458
Maybe a few less photos
of our secret spy mission, buddy.

08:25.458 --> 08:28.583
Uh-huh, which those two are not coming on.

08:28.583 --> 08:30.416
Bobby Ray is my right hand.

08:30.416 --> 08:33.000
And Scatter's a grenade in my other hand.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.791
If I'm on the mission, they are too.

08:35.791 --> 08:37.416
Yeah, okay, just keep Nixon busy

08:37.416 --> 08:39.541
while I fake-join
a tour group and grab the file.

08:39.541 --> 08:41.500
Hang on. A tour? Can I do that?

08:41.500 --> 08:43.708
Nope. But how about the next best thing?

08:44.375 --> 08:47.250
Howard shoved that disaster in my bag
when he heard we were coming here.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.000
Hot damn, it's also an audiobook!

08:49.000 --> 08:51.166
Yeah. He said it would blow your mind.

08:51.166 --> 08:54.166
Which, knowing Howard, might mean
literally, so I'd be careful with that.

08:54.916 --> 08:56.375
-  Well, your funeral.

08:56.375 --> 08:58.125
Now are you sure you can get to Nixon?

08:58.125 --> 09:00.333
An idea or two, mostly along the lines of...

09:01.916 --> 09:04.416
Elvis Presley, to see the President.

09:06.458 --> 09:07.583
Okay, that was pretty cool.

09:07.583 --> 09:09.416
-  Sorry, Elvis.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.958
I-I'm a giant fan, I really am,

09:11.958 --> 09:13.416
but you can't take this in.

09:13.416 --> 09:15.833
But it's a gift. For the President.

09:15.833 --> 09:17.041
The President? Really?

09:17.041 --> 09:20.208
Well, as soon
as you get me a cool box for it, it is.

09:20.208 --> 09:24.208
Oh, wait, then I know there's
a really cool box in the Lincoln Bedroom.

09:24.208 --> 09:25.250
Works for me, friend.

09:25.250 --> 09:26.625
Yes, sir!

09:28.625 --> 09:30.708
You got to be fucking kidding me.
That actually worked?

09:31.916 --> 09:33.916
You're in my world now.

09:33.916 --> 09:37.500
Which apparently includes
one very stupid Secret Service agent.

09:39.416 --> 09:41.791
<i>Hi, and welcome to the White House,</i>

09:41.791 --> 09:45.416
<i>a structure that was stolen
brick-by-brick from France</i>,

09:45.416 --> 09:49.000
<i>and then reassembled in reverse
so no one would notice.</i>

09:49.000 --> 09:50.250
What?

09:50.250 --> 09:53.375
<i>By now you should be passing
the Roosevelt Room,</i>

09:53.375 --> 09:55.666
<i>named after President Teddy Roosevelt,</i>

09:55.666 --> 10:00.166
<i>who himself was named after the bear
that ate his mother and then raised him.</i>

10:00.166 --> 10:03.250
Hey, E! Room's named after a bear,
by the way.

10:03.250 --> 10:06.708
I get that you want him on the mission,
but does he have to be on the comms?

10:06.708 --> 10:08.458
Hey, you gave him the book.

10:08.458 --> 10:09.666
Take away his earpiece.

10:09.666 --> 10:11.125
I don't think I will.

10:11.125 --> 10:13.416
Not your call. I'm the Agent in Charge.

10:13.416 --> 10:15.625
Then charge on over and handle it.

10:15.625 --> 10:17.708
<i>I need you focused on the mission.</i>

10:17.708 --> 10:18.916
Who, yours or mine?

10:18.916 --> 10:20.583
It's the same mission!

10:20.583 --> 10:22.041
Wrong.

10:22.041 --> 10:23.833
You see, you're here to steal.

10:23.833 --> 10:27.625
I'm here to prove
that Nixon is tied with yours truly

10:27.625 --> 10:29.625
for the World's Greatest American.

10:29.625 --> 10:33.083
Spoiler alert,
the guy actually completely sucks balls.

10:33.083 --> 10:35.791
Get ready to be wrong one more time.

10:35.791 --> 10:37.208
Mr. Presley.

10:38.208 --> 10:40.458
It's an absolute honor to meet you, sir.

10:40.458 --> 10:41.708
<i>Ugh, gross.</i>

10:41.708 --> 10:44.958
Mr. President, honor is all mine, sir.

10:44.958 --> 10:46.958
You are truly a great American.

10:46.958 --> 10:47.958
Oh, thank you.

10:47.958 --> 10:50.416
<i>Couldn't quite hear that last part,
but just curious.</i>

10:50.416 --> 10:53.041
<i>What's the view like fully up his ass?</i>

10:56.166 --> 10:58.125
<i>Completed in 1909,</i>

10:58.125 --> 11:01.625
<i>the Oval Office was designed
by a guy named Brian,</i>

11:01.625 --> 11:05.125
<i>who believed all right angles
were a sign of the apocalypse.</i>

11:05.125 --> 11:06.416
<i>Which they are.</i>

11:07.833 --> 11:11.000
Total fucking idiot.
What a bunch of bullshit.

11:12.375 --> 11:14.708
Which is why it's called the East Room.

11:16.291 --> 11:18.125
Excuse me. Where's the bathroom?

11:18.125 --> 11:20.250
Oh, bathrooms are at the end of this tour.

11:20.250 --> 11:21.500
Mm.

11:21.500 --> 11:26.541
Look, I kind of had a half-eaten burrito
I found behind my hotel for breakfast.

11:26.541 --> 11:29.375
- Ew, that's disgusting.
- Yeah. Yeah.

11:29.375 --> 11:32.625
Wait till you see it. You're about to if
you don't tell me where the bathroom is.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.041
Down the hall to your right.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.416
Cool. Back in a jiff.

11:42.791 --> 11:45.750
<i>♪ Stop, look, and listen, baby ♪</i>

11:45.750 --> 11:48.083
<i>♪ That's my philosophy ♪</i>

11:49.375 --> 11:52.750
<i>♪ It's called rubberneckin', baby ♪</i>

11:52.750 --> 11:54.166
- Oh God.

11:54.166 --> 11:56.041
I really shouldn't have
eaten that burrito.

11:56.041 --> 11:59.291
<i>♪ Stop, look, and listen, baby ♪</i>

11:59.291 --> 12:01.791
<i>♪ That's my philosophy ♪</i>

12:03.083 --> 12:06.166
<i>♪ It's called rubberneckin', baby ♪</i>

12:06.166 --> 12:08.666
<i>♪ But that's all right with me ♪</i>

12:09.958 --> 12:15.125
Yeah. And all those Secret Service morons
just let him in, gun and all.

12:15.875 --> 12:17.250
Boss seems fine with him.

12:19.708 --> 12:22.166
Thanks. Wait, how did you get in here?

12:34.958 --> 12:36.875
Well, this has been great.

12:36.875 --> 12:39.250
I must say
it's been my honor, Mr. President.

12:39.250 --> 12:42.791
But, unfortunately, I've got to head
to the residence and read some--

12:42.791 --> 12:44.041
Whoa, whoa. Not yet.

12:44.583 --> 12:46.208
I mean, I almost forgot.

12:47.625 --> 12:49.875
You see, I, uh...
I brought you something, sir.

12:49.875 --> 12:52.125
Oh. It's magnificent.

12:52.708 --> 12:55.875
I bet I could take down a drug-dealing
hippie from 50 yards with this baby.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.458
- Technically, you could take down seven.

12:58.458 --> 13:00.541
That's the dream. Thank you.

13:00.541 --> 13:05.166
For all you've done to restore
security to this country, Mr. President,

13:05.166 --> 13:07.333
you, sir, have earned it.

13:07.333 --> 13:09.708
Hey, check this out. Gun!

13:16.458 --> 13:18.875
I'm just fucking with you boys.

13:23.416 --> 13:24.833
That's a good one, Mr. President.

13:24.833 --> 13:26.666
<i>Yeah. What a charmer.</i>

13:27.375 --> 13:29.125
Damn it. This hallway should be empty.

13:29.125 --> 13:31.416
But of course
Nixon has private security douchebags.

13:31.416 --> 13:33.791
We gotta get past those guys.

13:33.791 --> 13:36.500
Wait, what are you doing?
Are you stealing?

13:36.500 --> 13:39.416
- Don't worry. I steal too. All the time.

13:39.416 --> 13:40.875
I just call it "souveniring."

13:40.875 --> 13:42.458
It's all about the branding these days.

13:42.458 --> 13:45.291
- Shit. Need a Plan B, fast.

13:58.500 --> 14:01.458
Well, one great gift deserves another.

14:01.458 --> 14:03.875
I understand you like badges.

14:05.166 --> 14:07.583
Federal Narcotics Officer.

14:07.583 --> 14:11.250
Just flash that baby if any staties
give you trouble on the highway.

14:11.250 --> 14:12.333
Wow.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.208
I absolutely love it, sir.

14:14.208 --> 14:18.666
What a generous, awesome,
great-guy thing to do, Mr. President.

14:18.666 --> 14:22.375
It's an incredibly irresponsible
abuse of power, but sure, why not?

14:22.375 --> 14:25.000
You know, a few really stupid people

14:25.000 --> 14:27.750
don't realize
what a great American you are, sir.

14:27.750 --> 14:29.708
Little busy here,
so if you can distract him

14:29.708 --> 14:32.291
without actually blowing the guy,
that would be great.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.791
Uh, is it just me, or does one of us
smell like unwashed ass and beef jerky?

14:47.250 --> 14:49.333
Ah, see? I knew it. Awesome.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.875
Now, the badge
is only honorary, of course.

14:52.875 --> 14:54.708
Well, let's play it by ear.

14:54.708 --> 14:58.416
But that doesn't mean you can't
beat the crap out of some criminals for me

14:58.416 --> 14:59.833
from time to time, right?

15:06.166 --> 15:09.000
Also maybe beat up a few Jews
while you're at it.

15:10.416 --> 15:12.375
- Do what now?
- Ooh! That took a turn.

15:12.375 --> 15:13.750
Sorry. Did I say "Jews"?

15:13.750 --> 15:14.916
I, uh...

15:14.916 --> 15:18.833
I meant Negroes. They blend for me,
and sometimes literally.

15:21.666 --> 15:25.625
Don't get me started on crossbreeding.

15:25.625 --> 15:26.791
<i>There it is.</i>

15:26.791 --> 15:28.208
Moron.

15:28.208 --> 15:29.500
Status report.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.458
Crawling through a metal tube
with a monkey.

15:31.458 --> 15:33.833
Well, that sounds
distressingly off-mission.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.083
Don't worry, we're close.

15:35.083 --> 15:37.166
Just keep me posted. And get it done.

15:37.958 --> 15:39.041
Same goes for you.

15:39.583 --> 15:41.208
Because if you're not done
in five minutes,

15:41.208 --> 15:42.708
these chocolate stains

15:43.333 --> 15:44.875
become bloodstains.

15:44.875 --> 15:47.375
- Okay, that's the residence, dead ahead.

15:48.708 --> 15:50.875
What, the tranq gun? Ugh, fine.

15:50.875 --> 15:53.791
Hey, hey! Look at me.
For emergencies only.

15:54.416 --> 15:55.791
And a few extras for fun.

16:04.083 --> 16:06.333
Did you just shoot the First Lady?

16:06.333 --> 16:07.541
Wait, wrong tone.

16:07.541 --> 16:10.958
Did you just shoot the First fucking Lady?

16:11.833 --> 16:14.291
Hilarious! Okay, now watch the door, okay?

16:17.375 --> 16:19.000
Please. Already?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.541
It's barely two o'clock.

16:20.541 --> 16:21.541
Ah!

16:21.541 --> 16:25.000
Helping a VIP guest like Elvis
does not make me a groupie--

16:25.000 --> 16:25.916
Ah!

16:27.791 --> 16:29.375
So, when you think about it,

16:29.375 --> 16:31.916
the Vietnam War
is really just the Lord's way

16:31.916 --> 16:34.875
of ridding the world
of another mongoloid bloodline.

16:34.875 --> 16:38.625
Yep. I can think
of a bloodline I'd love to get rid of,

16:39.750 --> 16:40.583
sir.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.583
Ha! I bet you can.

16:43.166 --> 16:46.666
You know, Jesus loves napalm.
It's in Corinthians.

16:46.666 --> 16:48.083
- Of course, they call it...

16:48.083 --> 16:50.000
Can't take much more of this.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.625
Yeah, even that weird-ass book
was better than this shit.

16:52.625 --> 16:54.000
Jesus, is that the time?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.750
Sorry, I need
to get back to the residence.

16:55.750 --> 16:57.541
Great! Please do. Sounds good.

16:57.541 --> 16:59.458
<i>No! No! Sounds bad.</i>

16:59.458 --> 17:00.958
We're still in here.

17:00.958 --> 17:02.875
Stall your shitty, racist hero.

17:02.875 --> 17:05.750
Well, it was great meeting
a like-minded man of action.

17:05.750 --> 17:08.333
No, you know what?
Can you wait a second, Mr. President?

17:08.333 --> 17:09.666
Let's get a photo together.

17:11.125 --> 17:13.000
I love it! Make it quick.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.666
Let's do this, CeCe.

17:16.666 --> 17:18.208
Excuse me!

17:18.208 --> 17:20.666
Please don't take that tone
with the Agent in Charge.

17:20.666 --> 17:22.458
<i>Which you're still not.</i>

17:22.458 --> 17:24.666
<i>Get the file.</i>

17:25.208 --> 17:26.958
What file? Oh, right, right, right.

17:28.125 --> 17:30.000
Oh, hello. That was easy.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.875
Hell of a grip, son.

17:33.041 --> 17:34.333
Feel free to loosen up.

17:34.833 --> 17:36.666
Take the picture, Bobby Ray.

17:36.666 --> 17:38.000
Take your time.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.916
Take your time.

17:41.458 --> 17:43.166
Whoops! Left the lens cap on.

17:43.166 --> 17:44.708
Whoopsie-daisy.

17:44.708 --> 17:45.625
Hang on.

17:46.125 --> 17:48.083
Oh man, no flash.

17:48.083 --> 17:49.791
Whoops. Uh, hang on.

17:50.375 --> 17:53.250
Now, what does this button here do?

17:53.250 --> 17:56.875
Oh hell, I hadn't used
one of these in a while.

17:57.416 --> 18:00.208
- Don't have all day here.
- Oh, it won't take a minute, Dick.

18:00.208 --> 18:03.625
- Excuse me?
- Oh no, no, no. Not like "dick," Dick.

18:04.208 --> 18:08.250
Not like some spineless, lowlife
piece of shit on the bottom of my boot

18:08.250 --> 18:11.666
that gets scraped off
onto a bigger pile of shit, kind of dick.

18:12.250 --> 18:15.750
No. Like your name, Mr. President. Dick.

18:15.750 --> 18:18.833
- I prefer "Mr. President."
- I'll try to remember that.

18:18.833 --> 18:20.333
<i>Good news, I got the file.</i>

18:20.333 --> 18:24.500
And even gooder news, he had
two letter openers, so we each get one.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Ooh.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.083
Okay. What'd I miss?

18:32.333 --> 18:34.000
Okay, fun thought,

18:34.000 --> 18:35.583
but no live souvenirs.

18:35.583 --> 18:36.916
Damn it!

18:36.916 --> 18:40.041
Okay, flash on, film in, cap off,

18:40.041 --> 18:42.000
no scary birds at the window,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.458
and are we ready?

18:46.083 --> 18:48.708
Quite a grip there. Almost broke my hand.

18:48.708 --> 18:50.833
Well, you can't blame a guy for trying.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.375
Should've just shot that racist bastard.

18:54.375 --> 18:58.333
On a secret TCB mission.
Heh! Would've made a splash.

18:58.333 --> 19:00.125
<i>What are you two talking about?</i>

19:00.125 --> 19:02.875
Please tell me
you morons aren't talking about TCB

19:02.875 --> 19:05.916
during the mission that's about
hiding the existence of TCB.

19:05.916 --> 19:08.416
Don't worry, the asshole's gone.

19:08.416 --> 19:10.916
Nixon records everything
in the Oval Office, jackass.

19:10.916 --> 19:13.208
We're screwed.
Like, in every fucking hole.

19:14.125 --> 19:17.125
This is why you shouldn't be in charge.

19:17.125 --> 19:18.541
Mistakes like this.

19:20.000 --> 19:20.833
Psst!

19:23.666 --> 19:24.833
Okay, this is bad.

19:24.833 --> 19:26.791
Hey, at least we got the file.

19:26.791 --> 19:30.666
The file means shit if you're on tape
talking about TCB. We're fucked.

19:30.666 --> 19:33.500
Then how come the chimp's
doing his celebration bump?

19:35.500 --> 19:37.708
Hey! Cocaine is for winners.

19:37.708 --> 19:39.250
Can we just call the Commander?

19:39.250 --> 19:42.541
Why? So I can tell our boss that
while I was busy hiding from gunmen,

19:42.541 --> 19:45.500
crawling through vents
and choking on monkey ass,

19:45.500 --> 19:47.916
my subordinate fucked up
his simple mission

19:47.916 --> 19:49.916
to keep a shitty racist happy,
and in the process...

19:49.916 --> 19:52.208
- ...exposed the existence of an organization

19:52.208 --> 19:55.083
that managed to hide in the shadows
for fucking centuries?

19:55.958 --> 19:58.250
No, I wouldn't pitch it quite like that.

19:58.250 --> 20:00.666
We need to know where Nixon's
White House recording system is.

20:00.666 --> 20:02.166
Oh come on, that's easy.

20:02.166 --> 20:04.541
It's in a secret room
behind the bowling alley.

20:05.666 --> 20:07.708
What? It's Howard's audiobook.

20:07.708 --> 20:09.958
Well, it's the best lead we've got.
Come on.

20:11.791 --> 20:12.916
Hold on a sec.

20:16.041 --> 20:17.375
He doesn't deserve this.

20:18.750 --> 20:21.083
But I do deserve this.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.250
Hey, uh, think we got time for a game?

20:26.250 --> 20:28.500
Uh, still on a covert mission, BR.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.833
That must be it over there.

20:34.666 --> 20:37.333
Oh hell no.
Mm-mm. No more vents for this girl.

20:37.333 --> 20:38.250
Scatter.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.000
Okay, that works too.

20:45.208 --> 20:46.166
Jackpot.

20:47.791 --> 20:52.833
"Kennedy blackmail," "Johnson blackmail,"
"Arnold Palmer blackmail,"

20:52.833 --> 20:54.250
"Nixon's..."

20:54.250 --> 20:56.083
"Nixon's sex ideas"?

20:56.083 --> 20:58.166
What the hell are Nixon's sex ideas?

20:58.166 --> 21:02.916
Ugh. Guessing angry missionary
while watching police beat up teenagers?

21:02.916 --> 21:04.541
Yep, I'd say that's about right.

21:05.291 --> 21:08.791
Okay, I just went ahead and cut
a full 17 minutes out of the tape.

21:08.791 --> 21:10.583
The TCB thing is completely erased.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.708

might just be a really nice pen.

22:15.541 --> 22:17.250
-  What?
- How am I supposed to know?

22:17.250 --> 22:18.541
Howard doesn't label things.

22:18.541 --> 22:20.916
Damn it. Next time I pick my own gadgets.

22:27.666 --> 22:29.458
Yep. Just a pen.

22:31.500 --> 22:33.416
Okay, yeah, probably time to go.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.375
Shit. Where's the extraction point?

22:42.125 --> 22:45.250
We got some agent-looking fellas
coming up behind us back there.

22:46.458 --> 22:47.875
Not to mention that.

22:49.541 --> 22:51.833
Marine One? Oh fuck. We're fucked.

22:54.083 --> 22:55.041
Huh?

23:01.666 --> 23:04.375
- Okay.
- Did you get Nixon's sex idea tape?

23:04.375 --> 23:05.625
Asking for a friend.

23:08.041 --> 23:10.750
From now on, you're on all my missions.

23:10.750 --> 23:13.500
Also, family photo. What'd you get?

23:14.833 --> 23:16.208
"Truth about Area 51"?

23:16.791 --> 23:18.166
Oh. My thing sucks.

23:21.083 --> 23:22.166
As requested.

23:23.541 --> 23:26.208
So, uh, you gonna tell me what's in there?

23:26.750 --> 23:28.583
Son, that's above your pay grade.

23:31.333 --> 23:34.375
You obviously have no idea
how much I get paid.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.791
Wait, are we flying the wrong way?

23:38.791 --> 23:40.833
You're goddamned right.

23:40.833 --> 23:44.791
I insist on every mission ending
by flying into the sunset.

23:45.500 --> 23:46.416
Fuck yeah.

23:46.416 --> 23:48.041
God, my nipples are hard.

23:48.041 --> 23:49.666
Maximum density.

23:56.291 --> 23:59.375
Okay, Woodward.
This is how this is gonna work.

23:59.375 --> 24:00.375
It's simple.

24:00.375 --> 24:02.541
I feed you information on Tricky Dick,

24:02.541 --> 24:05.875
and you get to be the reporter
who brought down an American President.

24:05.875 --> 24:08.416
You don't call me. I call you.

24:08.416 --> 24:10.333
And no names. Ever.

24:10.875 --> 24:13.583
From here on, just call me Deep Throat.

24:14.291 --> 24:16.125
Little nickname between Pat Nixon and I.

24:17.125 --> 24:18.750
The woman's insatiable.

24:19.916 --> 24:24.250
Hey, hey, anyone ever tell you that
you look exactly like Robert Redford...

24:24.916 --> 24:25.791
naked?
