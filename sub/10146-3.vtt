00:01.645 --> 00:03.805
You want me to bomb my own Embassy?

00:05.644 --> 00:08.085
Working on being
Father Of The Year in about 16 hours.

00:08.310 --> 00:09.669
Something lands in Bangkok.

00:09.789 --> 00:11.869
The man I deal with is called Lee.

00:11.990 --> 00:13.509
He's Office 39.

00:13.669 --> 00:15.750
Office 39 are pretty much
the most ruthless covert

00:15.869 --> 00:17.230
organisation on the planet.

00:17.429 --> 00:20.070
They do anything that generates
hard currency for the North Korean

00:20.190 --> 00:22.070
nuclear missile programme.

00:24.710 --> 00:26.350
Li-Na will save everything.

00:26.510 --> 00:28.829
She's at the hospital
with Foster and May.

00:28.949 --> 00:31.350
My name has never been May.

00:51.390 --> 00:53.310
Duty...

00:54.909 --> 00:56.509
Compassion.

00:56.670 --> 01:00.469
The conflict between these two
obligations defines who you are.

01:02.670 --> 01:05.349
It defines any warrior.

01:09.829 --> 01:12.310
Our crystal meth
was destroyed by Section 20.

01:13.710 --> 01:17.230
But the deal that I have
with you will be fulfilled.

01:17.390 --> 01:20.549
Another shipment
will be here within 48 hours.

01:20.670 --> 01:21.789
There will be no deal.

01:23.390 --> 01:26.269
My son is young and foolish.

01:26.430 --> 01:29.189
He overstepped his authority
by agreeing.

01:29.349 --> 01:33.909
What you're asking from us
is wrong, empty of honour.

01:35.469 --> 01:39.310
As the Commissioner of the syndicate,
I cannot agree to it.

01:40.549 --> 01:42.829
Our business here is concluded.

02:02.430 --> 02:04.829
Now you are Commissioner.

02:06.829 --> 02:09.550
Not if the Council
learn of my betrayal.

02:09.669 --> 02:11.270
Deliver what you promised

02:11.430 --> 02:15.830
and your syndicate will become
the most powerful in Southeast Asia.

02:15.949 --> 02:19.509
Tell your people Section 20 did this

02:19.670 --> 02:22.289
and that your father's death
needs to be avenged.

03:27.430 --> 03:29.349
How quickly can we get the results?

03:29.469 --> 03:30.949
I should have something later today.

03:34.349 --> 03:36.949
What are you doing?
You can't go in there!

03:37.110 --> 03:41.389
My husband's body is to be flown
back to the UK. Mei. Philip.

03:42.509 --> 03:45.189
I tried to contact you.
I'm sorry, this was my call.

03:45.349 --> 03:48.710
You don't think Robin died
as a result of his injuries.

03:48.870 --> 03:52.069
Nothing's certain, but the autopsy
should give us some answers.

03:52.229 --> 03:54.389
Mei, the Foreign Office
have signed off on this.

03:54.509 --> 03:57.870
But I would like your permission.

03:59.469 --> 04:01.389
Whatever you think is necessary.

04:04.830 --> 04:07.909
And Li-Na? She's being dealt with.

04:18.949 --> 04:22.470
Tell us about Lee Da-Ho.
I... I don't know who that is.

04:27.269 --> 04:31.350
An aid, for Office 39.
We believe the embassy bombing was

04:31.470 --> 04:33.110
a prelude to what they had planned.

04:35.029 --> 04:38.430
Lee Da-Ho. North Korean agent.

04:39.709 --> 04:43.829
And we've got some CCTV footage
there near the Office 39 building.

04:43.990 --> 04:48.069
You're working for Lee.
No. You obviously met with him.

04:48.230 --> 04:52.590
I meet a lot of people.
But I had no idea who he was.

04:52.750 --> 04:56.029
Bullshit! He was a terrorist
drug dealer. Talk to us, Li-Na.

04:59.389 --> 05:02.629
Go on. Maybe you got
too deeply involved in something.

05:02.790 --> 05:06.069
Maybe you found out
things you weren't supposed to.

05:06.230 --> 05:10.750
But if you don't start
being honest with us...

05:10.870 --> 05:13.509
If I talk, you'll protect me?

05:13.629 --> 05:15.589
If you tell us the truth, yes.

05:21.910 --> 05:29.629
I fed Office 39 information. About
what? Fosters, you, everything.

05:29.790 --> 05:32.870
Why help the North Koreans?
They're my people.

05:34.350 --> 05:36.389
Then you know what
they have planned?

05:36.550 --> 05:38.769
All I know was Foster
was supposed to die in the attack

05:38.829 --> 05:43.909
and when he didn't, he instructed me
to kill him. I don't ask questions.

05:44.029 --> 05:47.029
I only follow orders.

05:49.790 --> 05:51.670
Boss?

05:51.829 --> 05:54.709
Well, she hardly blinked
when we tied her to Lee.

05:54.829 --> 05:57.069
But to fold just like that?

05:57.189 --> 05:58.430
Admit everything?

06:00.949 --> 06:03.589
Why? Hmm?

06:37.909 --> 06:40.269
Hello? May.

06:40.430 --> 06:42.269
Philip?
Li-Na confessed.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.990
My God, to everything?

06:48.110 --> 06:50.790
Look, I wouldn't normally
ask this, but...

06:50.909 --> 06:52.509
You want me to come over?

06:52.670 --> 06:55.550
It might help verify
some of what she's saying.

06:57.389 --> 06:59.670
I'll send a car. All right.

08:53.549 --> 08:57.549
I think you and Finn are going
to get on like a house on fire.

08:57.669 --> 08:58.710
You do?

09:00.190 --> 09:02.830
I hope so.

09:02.950 --> 09:03.909
What is it?

09:06.629 --> 09:12.230
Sounds kind of crazy but, uh,
I always felt like I wanted

09:12.350 --> 09:13.789
to go home.

09:13.909 --> 09:15.509
Now, home's coming to you.

09:16.789 --> 09:20.830
Yeah... Come here.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.629
You feel like home to me.

09:31.830 --> 09:36.309
When all this is done I'm going to
take you for some dinner, dancing...

09:37.590 --> 09:40.750
What? Dancing? Yeah.

09:40.870 --> 09:43.149
I've seen you dance.

09:44.350 --> 09:46.350
Yeah.

09:46.470 --> 09:48.429
Just spend some time with your son.

09:48.549 --> 09:51.950
OK? That's what's important now.

09:55.549 --> 09:58.509
Why is Li-Na trying to focus
all our attention on her?

09:58.629 --> 09:59.629
OK, try this one out.

10:00.990 --> 10:03.549
What if there was another
North Korean agent in the Embassy?

10:03.710 --> 10:06.029
What if Robin was murdered to
stop him helping us find out

10:06.149 --> 10:07.269
who that agent is?

10:10.110 --> 10:11.909
Ask her how she killed him.

10:12.029 --> 10:13.269
Martinez?

10:20.110 --> 10:22.669
Yeah, pathology, it's urgent.

10:51.389 --> 10:54.029
Finn?

10:54.149 --> 10:55.110
Damian?

10:59.870 --> 11:00.990
Hey, Nick.

11:14.269 --> 11:15.509
Whatever!

11:17.549 --> 11:20.710
Colonel Locke? Yeah, go ahead.

11:20.870 --> 11:24.070
I only have preliminarily
results from the toxicology report

11:24.190 --> 11:25.909
but our suspicions were correct.

11:26.070 --> 11:29.789
There are traces of potassium
chloride in the bloodstream.

11:29.950 --> 11:33.470
So, that's what brought
on the heart attack?

11:33.590 --> 11:35.509
Somebody got to him.

11:35.669 --> 11:41.990
And the delivery system? Injection?
It's possible, yes. When?

11:42.110 --> 11:44.389
Given the high level of traces,

11:44.549 --> 11:47.870
the ambassador would have gone
into cardiac arrest within minutes.

11:50.789 --> 11:52.710
Robin Forster was poisoned...

11:52.830 --> 11:56.230
After we'd taken Li-Na into custody.

11:56.389 --> 11:59.710
And the only person
that was with him was his wife.

12:04.590 --> 12:09.350
How did you know I was going
to be there? Your mom told me.

12:13.110 --> 12:18.990
She called. Said you had some
trouble, flew out here to find me.

12:19.149 --> 12:21.110
She's pretty pissed at you,
by the way.

12:21.837 --> 12:25.009
Don't worry,
I've got ways of dealing with that.

12:55.158 --> 12:58.197
I know this is weird
for both of us. All right?

12:58.357 --> 13:03.357
And, look, I don't know what your mom
told you about what happened to us.

13:03.479 --> 13:07.839
She got pregnant. You walked out.

13:07.958 --> 13:09.479
That about covering it?

13:11.477 --> 13:13.197
Yeah.

13:16.918 --> 13:19.318
Finn, but your seatbelt on.

13:19.437 --> 13:22.597
Put your seatbelt on!

13:22.717 --> 13:27.398
Put your fucking seatbelt on. Now.

13:33.879 --> 13:35.119
Hold on.

13:53.957 --> 13:55.918
I'll deal with it.

13:59.717 --> 14:01.398
Agh! Ugh!

14:03.918 --> 14:05.518
Garland!

14:10.357 --> 14:13.477
Mikey, it's me.
I'm in the car with Finn.

14:13.597 --> 14:15.638
I've got some heat on me.

14:15.798 --> 14:17.278
Fuck!

14:18.638 --> 14:19.918
Whoa! What the fuck is that?!

14:20.077 --> 14:24.118
Put your head down! Damien,
what the fuck?! Put your head down!

14:29.238 --> 14:30.758
Window!

14:36.837 --> 14:38.398
Ugh!

14:55.717 --> 14:57.557
Martinez! Michael! Talk to me!

14:57.677 --> 14:59.437
I'm good, but Lawan's down.

14:59.557 --> 15:01.118
I'm here! Garland's hit!

15:06.158 --> 15:07.518
Grenade!

15:16.557 --> 15:17.837
Fuck!

15:32.878 --> 15:35.398
Shit!
I've got a fucking runner here!

15:35.518 --> 15:36.878
Chase him down, Michael.

15:56.758 --> 15:57.878
Stay down!

16:23.918 --> 16:26.557
We've got to get out of there.
Get out of that belt.

16:32.878 --> 16:34.317
There you go. Oh, fuck.

16:41.758 --> 16:44.798
Come on, keep moving.
We got to move. Finn, keep moving.

16:46.878 --> 16:48.238
Hands!

16:53.077 --> 16:54.317
Show me your hands!

17:00.398 --> 17:01.878
Fuck you!

17:01.998 --> 17:03.677
Gaijin, you killed my kumicho!

17:07.077 --> 17:08.678
Give me your phone.

17:08.837 --> 17:10.958
Your phone.
I want to see who you're talking to.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.798
Give me your phone.
Give me your phone.

17:13.916 --> 17:15.238
Give me your phone!

17:30.798 --> 17:32.877
The pin has the surname
Takagi written on it.

17:33.038 --> 17:35.597
Coming in. Clear?
Yeah, good.

17:35.758 --> 17:38.877
These guys are probably from the
yakuza syndicate based in Kyushu.

17:38.998 --> 17:41.038
One of the most powerful in Japan.

17:41.157 --> 17:42.798
They're in bed with Office 39.

17:50.798 --> 17:52.518
They think we killed their boss.

17:52.637 --> 17:54.357
Mike, I'm so sorry.

17:58.837 --> 18:00.278
Shit. Scott.

18:07.357 --> 18:09.877
'Mikey, it's me.
I'm in the car with Finn.

18:09.998 --> 18:11.117
'I've got some heat on me.'

18:11.238 --> 18:13.077
They hit Scott.

18:14.798 --> 18:16.117
'Fuck!'

18:16.238 --> 18:17.597
'Whoa, what the fuck is that?'

18:17.718 --> 18:18.758
'Put your head down!'

18:18.917 --> 18:21.317
'Damien, what the fuck?!'
'Put your head down!'

18:24.157 --> 18:25.678
Go and find him. Yeah, roger that.

18:25.798 --> 18:27.478
Martinez. Yeah?

18:27.597 --> 18:29.518
We'll pick up Mei.

18:44.357 --> 18:47.357
OK, the last signal from Scott's
phone? 15 clicks west of here.

18:47.478 --> 18:48.557
Right, let's go.

19:00.917 --> 19:02.998
We've come to see Mei.

19:03.117 --> 19:04.238
I'm sorry, sir.

19:04.397 --> 19:07.038
Mrs Foster is not
expecting visitors today.

19:07.157 --> 19:08.357
Of course she isn't!

19:09.678 --> 19:10.718
Khan, it's...

19:10.837 --> 19:12.317
It's OK. They can come in.

19:22.117 --> 19:23.877
Is she in there?

19:24.038 --> 19:26.238
Mei? She's upstairs,
she's got a headache.

19:28.238 --> 19:31.117
Is everything all right? I want you
to pack a bag and get ready to leave.

19:31.238 --> 19:32.157
Do you understand?

19:32.317 --> 19:35.157
No. What's going on?
Will you do as I say?

19:35.317 --> 19:37.278
Chloe, you're going to have
to trust me, OK?

19:43.718 --> 19:45.998
It says he's here!

19:46.117 --> 19:47.478
Fuck!

19:49.438 --> 19:51.478
No. Michael...

19:51.597 --> 19:53.038
Shit.

19:54.478 --> 19:55.597
Michael...

19:57.117 --> 19:58.518
OK, come on.

20:21.917 --> 20:24.238
I didn't expect
to see you here in person.

20:27.798 --> 20:30.077
I'm sure you didn't.

20:30.238 --> 20:32.557
So, was killing him
always part of the plan?

20:33.917 --> 20:36.077
Killing who?

20:36.198 --> 20:37.958
What are you saying?

20:38.077 --> 20:39.478
No, don't.

20:39.597 --> 20:40.837
Don't!!

20:46.077 --> 20:47.958
It's over, Mei.

20:48.077 --> 20:49.877
You're scaring me.

20:49.998 --> 20:51.998
Why are you saying this?

20:52.117 --> 20:53.958
Because I know you killed him.

20:54.117 --> 20:56.718
And all those years,
he thought you loved him.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.438
Please...

21:00.597 --> 21:02.438
I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:02.557 --> 21:03.958
No, do not come any closer.

21:05.077 --> 21:06.438
I know what you are.

21:08.317 --> 21:09.678
You've no idea!

21:18.718 --> 21:19.678
Argh!

21:30.998 --> 21:32.518
What's going on? Ah!

21:34.077 --> 21:37.238
Mei... what are you doing?!
She'll be dead before you reach it.

21:41.157 --> 21:42.557
Please, Mei.

21:43.837 --> 21:45.478
Please...

21:45.597 --> 21:46.837
Not Chloe.

21:49.877 --> 21:51.157
Mei!! No!!

21:52.837 --> 21:55.677
Save her or take me. Your choice.

22:10.038 --> 22:12.278
It's OK. She didn't do it.

22:12.397 --> 22:13.518
Come here.

22:16.317 --> 22:18.958
No bodies.
No visible sign of injuries.

22:19.077 --> 22:20.278
Yeah, boss?

22:20.397 --> 22:21.678
Yeah, it's us.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.597
We found Scott's Jeep.

22:23.718 --> 22:25.438
And Scott?

22:25.557 --> 22:26.837
No, he's not here.

22:26.958 --> 22:28.278
Permission to go look for him.

22:28.438 --> 22:32.077
No, I need you back here.
Mei is behind everything.

22:32.198 --> 22:33.597
And she's on the run.

22:33.718 --> 22:35.518
Yeah, roger that.

22:35.637 --> 22:37.198
He wants us back.

22:37.317 --> 22:39.597
Wait, we need to find Scott.

22:39.718 --> 22:41.038
What if the yakuza took him?

22:41.198 --> 22:43.357
Well, then Mei's our best chance
of getting him back.

22:43.478 --> 22:45.198
Let's go. Come on.

23:06.625 --> 23:09.266
Well, at least now
the enemy has a face.

23:09.425 --> 23:12.465
Whatever her name is,
she enrolled at Cambridge University

23:12.575 --> 23:14.734
at the age of 18
as a Japanese national.

23:16.934 --> 23:18.734
And before that?

23:18.855 --> 23:21.095
Absolutely nothing.

23:21.255 --> 23:23.855
So, she must have been part
of the espionage programme.

23:25.295 --> 23:31.255
Stripped of their identity
and trained to speak, dress, think...

23:31.375 --> 23:32.934
and live in the skin of another.

23:33.095 --> 23:36.095
She's not a terrorist,
she is a highly-motivated operative

23:36.255 --> 23:39.095
with a mission she has shown
incredible dedication to.

23:39.255 --> 23:41.974
Unless we know
what that mission is...

23:42.134 --> 23:44.335
and why she's dealing
with the yakuza...

23:44.494 --> 23:47.934
we'll be one step behind her
and her masters from North Korea.

23:49.535 --> 23:51.894
She used the yakuza to get to us.

23:52.055 --> 23:54.934
Let's use them to get to her.
Agreed.

23:55.055 --> 23:56.214
So, what do we know?

23:56.375 --> 23:58.494
Well, according
to the yakuza website,

23:58.654 --> 24:01.335
their kumicho, Takagi,
was found dead this morning.

24:01.454 --> 24:02.775
Their website?

24:02.934 --> 24:05.095
Think PricewaterhouseCoopers,
but with AKs

24:05.214 --> 24:07.055
and their own fan magazine.

24:07.214 --> 24:10.174
So, if their kumicho's dead,
who's stepping up to the plate?

24:10.335 --> 24:12.815
Shiro. He's been running
the Thai organisation

24:12.934 --> 24:14.214
for the last five years.

24:14.375 --> 24:17.974
He's Takagi's son and, if the
council approve, his successor.

24:19.454 --> 24:20.734
Hey!

24:20.855 --> 24:21.974
Yaaa!

24:28.454 --> 24:29.815
Hey!

24:29.934 --> 24:30.855
Yaaa!

24:32.214 --> 24:34.535
Hey! Hey! Yaaa!

24:40.815 --> 24:42.974
You failed.

24:43.134 --> 24:46.134
Locke is still alive,
while you play at fighting here.

24:46.295 --> 24:48.894
We afflicted heavy casualties
on them.

24:49.015 --> 24:51.494
Bought ourselves the time we need.

24:51.654 --> 24:53.974
The exchange
has to be brought forward.

24:54.134 --> 24:57.535
I've spoken to my people
and the drugs will be here tomorrow.

25:00.494 --> 25:02.335
If you can't deliver what I need...

25:02.454 --> 25:03.375
Tomorrow.

25:06.894 --> 25:07.894
Hai.

25:18.894 --> 25:21.295
Hey! Yaaa!

25:21.414 --> 25:23.615
Colonel? Yeah? We've got something.

25:25.295 --> 25:27.974
Members of the syndicate council
arriving in Krabi

25:28.095 --> 25:29.214
a couple of hours ago.

25:30.775 --> 25:33.654
Shiro and the syndicate
have offices there.

25:33.815 --> 25:36.694
This guy greeting them
is Akiyama, Shiro's right-hand man,

25:36.855 --> 25:40.494
the underboss
for the entire operation.

25:40.654 --> 25:42.694
On the right is Ito,
the company accountant.

25:42.855 --> 25:45.575
He'll meet with the council,
to go over the books.

25:45.694 --> 25:47.095
We find Shiro, we find Mei.

25:47.214 --> 25:48.654
We've got a plane to catch.

25:56.894 --> 25:58.974
Are they still after us?

25:59.095 --> 26:00.974
Yeah. Probably.

26:05.255 --> 26:07.095
Got to find a phone, dude.

26:07.214 --> 26:08.654
Got to get on to my team.

26:18.174 --> 26:20.174
Why are they trying to kill you?

26:20.295 --> 26:21.654
I don't know.

26:21.775 --> 26:24.494
Probably because of my job.

26:24.615 --> 26:26.694
Because you're an IT consultant?!

26:26.855 --> 26:30.654
No. That's what
your mum told you? I'm in IT?

26:31.775 --> 26:33.375
I'm a soldier, Finn.

26:35.615 --> 26:38.214
Seriously? Yeah. I am.

26:40.174 --> 26:41.494
Former US military.

26:41.615 --> 26:43.335
Sergeant Damien Scott.

26:44.494 --> 26:46.855
Special Forces. Delta.

26:46.974 --> 26:48.255
The CIA.

26:49.615 --> 26:51.934
Now I'm working
for British intelligence.

26:52.095 --> 26:53.934
You think I'm going
to believe that?

26:54.055 --> 26:55.694
I mean, do I look stupid?

26:55.815 --> 26:58.454
No. You don't.

26:58.615 --> 27:01.295
So, what do you think
I do for a living, kid?

27:01.414 --> 27:03.174
Come on.

27:03.295 --> 27:05.414
You're in Bangkok on business,

27:05.575 --> 27:08.734
you've got a fucking nine mil
in the glove compartment... Yeah.

27:08.894 --> 27:12.174
..and you've got gangsters trying to
kill you! It's obvious, man. What?

27:12.295 --> 27:14.255
You're a drug dealer.

27:18.095 --> 27:21.615
Are you ever barking up
the wrong tree, kid!

27:21.734 --> 27:23.335
Huh?

27:23.494 --> 27:25.615
You said we've got to move,
we should move.

27:25.734 --> 27:27.974
Doesn't mean we've got to talk.

27:49.454 --> 27:51.734
Zero, target on time.

28:11.335 --> 28:13.214
He's gone inside.

28:17.654 --> 28:19.494
Ah, gentlemen.

28:25.055 --> 28:26.654
I want to thank you for your time.

28:28.734 --> 28:30.214
Please.

28:38.414 --> 28:40.335
Our mutual friend
speaks highly of you.

28:40.494 --> 28:42.494
I'm grateful
he could put us in touch.

28:44.615 --> 28:46.734
It is an honour to be here.

28:52.535 --> 28:54.375
So, when do we get to see your boss?

28:57.375 --> 29:01.375
Mr Shiro does not take these
kind of meetings. You deal with me.

29:01.535 --> 29:04.894
I deal with organ grinders,
not monkeys.

29:05.055 --> 29:09.375
Then perhaps there will be
no dealings at all.

29:09.494 --> 29:11.894
Smugglers are common. Easy to find.

29:13.414 --> 29:15.255
Not like us, they're not.

29:16.894 --> 29:19.734
I want to apologise for my friend.

29:19.855 --> 29:21.694
He's British.

29:21.815 --> 29:24.375
But he does got a point.

29:24.494 --> 29:26.775
You know our reputation.

29:26.934 --> 29:30.615
What we can offer
your organisation here.

29:30.734 --> 29:32.855
Real expansion.

29:33.015 --> 29:37.335
Shifting your meth
into American markets and beyond.

29:37.454 --> 29:40.134
Look, it's simple.

29:40.295 --> 29:43.934
Our guns come east,
your meth goes west.

29:44.095 --> 29:48.335
This is a multimillion dollar deal.
But respect goes both ways.

29:59.734 --> 30:03.775
If you ever apologise for me again,
I'll cut your bollocks off, mate.

30:07.575 --> 30:09.255
You think they're buying a car?

30:09.414 --> 30:12.694
I think they are someone else's
problem right now.

30:12.855 --> 30:16.174
I don't know, baby, I think it's a
good deal. Let's check the interior.

30:19.214 --> 30:23.214
Hey, guys, something's wrong here,
I don't know what happened.

30:23.375 --> 30:25.974
It's weird, I just opened
the door and it just...

30:36.015 --> 30:37.934
Afternoon.

30:38.055 --> 30:39.414
Richmond, on my left.

30:42.934 --> 30:44.295
Argh! Argh!

30:47.214 --> 30:48.855
Stay down!

30:49.015 --> 30:51.855
Come here! Do I have
your fucking attention, mate? Huh?

30:51.974 --> 30:53.255
Do you know who I am?

30:53.414 --> 30:56.174
Because I know who you are.
Fuck you!

30:56.295 --> 30:57.454
Argh!

31:04.414 --> 31:07.535
I know that you work for Mei Foster
and I know she ordered a hit on us.

31:07.694 --> 31:09.974
Now, I'm going to ask you
a very simple question

31:10.134 --> 31:14.295
and you are going to answer me.
Where is she? Fuck you!

31:21.375 --> 31:23.095
If you don't answer this question,

31:23.255 --> 31:26.375
I will burn
your fucking world to the ground!

31:28.575 --> 31:29.775
Contact!

31:38.575 --> 31:39.974
You got that, Richmond?

31:40.095 --> 31:41.375
Yeah!

31:46.855 --> 31:50.654
Look in my eyes. This is your last
chance. I'm not fucking about here.

31:50.775 --> 31:52.575
Where is Mei Foster?

31:54.894 --> 31:56.615
We've got to move!

31:57.734 --> 31:59.775
The... The island...

32:08.694 --> 32:10.134
Come on, now!

32:26.174 --> 32:27.974
Let's go, move, move!

33:16.174 --> 33:17.494
Fuck!

33:20.615 --> 33:23.214
Hide! Get under the water! Get under!

33:51.214 --> 33:55.335
Come here. Come here. Stay down.

33:55.454 --> 33:56.934
Come with me.

33:58.055 --> 34:01.775
Well, a lot of it's accounts,
so they are legitimate businesses,

34:01.894 --> 34:04.454
and the Kokura Foundation. Which is?

34:04.615 --> 34:06.694
It's a charity
set up by Shiro's father.

34:06.855 --> 34:09.655
Aid to developing countries,
disaster relief...

34:12.175 --> 34:15.414
Wait, I have a trust fund
in Shiro's name,

34:15.574 --> 34:18.255
used to purchase properties
in Thailand.

34:18.414 --> 34:23.054
Four in Bangkok, then one on a
private island off the coast, here.

34:23.215 --> 34:25.974
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think we have a winner.

34:26.094 --> 34:27.375
Good job.

34:27.534 --> 34:30.335
And if Shiro is there,
Mei will be alongside.

34:30.494 --> 34:32.855
This is for Damien.
We take her down.

34:56.007 --> 34:59.286
The Council are old men -
all that lies between you

34:59.407 --> 35:01.246
and what's rightfully yours.

35:02.646 --> 35:04.646
He belittled you.

35:04.766 --> 35:06.726
Undermined you.

35:06.760 --> 35:08.760
Didn't want to be eclipsed
by his son.

35:10.601 --> 35:15.960
Sometimes we must act decisively
to break free from the past.

35:16.081 --> 35:18.880
To find our future.

35:19.041 --> 35:23.760
Arrangements have been made.
You will get what you want.

35:55.641 --> 35:59.521
Any heavy contact, we pull back
to the RV, understood? Roger that.

36:27.481 --> 36:29.081
Moving? Move.

36:58.041 --> 36:59.481
Relax.

37:18.041 --> 37:19.760
It's Ito, the accountant.

37:19.880 --> 37:21.201
I've got it.

37:33.161 --> 37:34.601
Argh!

37:34.721 --> 37:35.880
Get up!

37:36.041 --> 37:38.601
You're going to tell me
what the syndicate have

37:38.760 --> 37:40.521
that the North Koreans
want so badly,

37:40.681 --> 37:43.001
or your days as
a Yakuza salaryman are over.

37:43.161 --> 37:47.561
I just look at the paperwork!
What does the paperwork say?

38:05.400 --> 38:07.681
Door locked. Shit!

38:07.800 --> 38:08.721
Contact!

38:13.400 --> 38:15.320
Richmond, move, move, move!

38:18.081 --> 38:19.521
I'm coming to you, boss.

38:30.521 --> 38:34.041
We have the intel.
Bravo 1, we have the intel.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.001
Hey, sit down!

38:37.161 --> 38:39.280
Don't you think
you should check that out?

38:45.081 --> 38:47.561
Let's get out of here,
or this thing's fucked!

38:48.721 --> 38:52.201
Bravo 1, we're heading back.
Roger that.

38:53.360 --> 38:55.481
Going left.

38:55.601 --> 38:57.760
Come on, Shiro, where are you?

39:27.360 --> 39:29.001
Argh!

39:53.240 --> 39:55.201
Zero, I have Shiro here.

39:55.320 --> 39:56.760
Fuck!

39:56.920 --> 40:00.360
Bravo 1, we are at the RV point
and we are taking fire.

40:00.481 --> 40:01.721
Can you come to us?

40:01.840 --> 40:03.601
Roger that!

40:13.201 --> 40:16.721
Zero, listen to me.
I want you to move on my call.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.880
Move!

40:21.001 --> 40:22.800
Moving!

40:28.760 --> 40:30.521
Argh!

40:34.760 --> 40:37.041
Bravo one, are you inbound?

40:37.161 --> 40:39.280
No, that's a negative. I'm cut off.

40:44.201 --> 40:47.400
Hold your position, Michael.
We're coming back for you.

40:47.521 --> 40:50.400
Negative. I'll find another exfil.

40:50.521 --> 40:51.601
Argh!

40:53.920 --> 40:55.840
OK, move out.

41:02.601 --> 41:04.280
Move in!

41:18.440 --> 41:19.641
Argh!

41:33.320 --> 41:35.240
Shit!

41:36.800 --> 41:39.440
Fuck. Fuck you, Damian!

41:41.280 --> 41:45.960
Oh, shit, buddy. I hope
you're having better luck than I am.

41:46.121 --> 41:51.121
The world didn't stop just because
you left. Mom found someone else.

41:51.280 --> 41:54.641
He brought me up like his own.
He's a good guy.

41:54.760 --> 41:57.201
Quiet.

41:57.320 --> 41:59.481
What? Hey, wait a minute. What?

41:59.641 --> 42:01.760
You were the one
that walked out on us. Shh.

42:01.920 --> 42:05.641
All right? Do you have any idea
how much of a mess Mom was? Huh?

42:05.800 --> 42:07.760
Just how much
you fucked our lives...

42:11.721 --> 42:14.880
Go on, go up there.

42:15.001 --> 42:18.161
No, no, come here. Get in there.

42:18.320 --> 42:21.081
Sit down. Now, stay there.
I'll be back in a second.

42:55.041 --> 42:57.440
Bravo one, send sitrep, over.

42:57.561 --> 43:00.240
Bravo one, send sitrep, over!

43:03.481 --> 43:05.880
Where are you, Michael?

43:07.121 --> 43:09.601
Here it is -

43:09.760 --> 43:12.681
the company
the accountant mentioned.

43:14.240 --> 43:16.641
Shit. What?

43:16.800 --> 43:19.440
The yakuza's shipment
for May is Vanadium.

43:21.320 --> 43:25.800
Used in missile technology. And the
last component Office 39 need.

43:25.920 --> 43:27.161
And if we don't stop it,

43:27.320 --> 43:29.880
we'll be facing a rogue state
with a million-man army,

43:30.041 --> 43:32.920
able to launch a nuclear strike
at Europe and the US

43:33.041 --> 43:35.240
at a moment's notice.

43:35.360 --> 43:37.681
We need the team back together.

43:41.760 --> 43:44.121
Where are you, boys?

43:44.240 --> 43:45.440
Where are you?

43:46.949 --> 44:30.804
