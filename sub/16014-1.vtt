10:55.530 --> 10:57.991
<i>-Well, uh...</i> <i>-Harley Quinn here.</i>

10:58.032 --> 11:02.162
<i>I first dreamed of being</i> <i>a hero when I was</i>

10:58.032 --> 11:02.162
<i>a babbling baby!</i>

11:02.203 --> 11:04.914
<i>And I saw</i> <i>a superhero</i>

11:02.203 --> 11:04.914
<i>on the telly.</i>

11:04.956 --> 11:06.749
(CONSOLE BEEPING)

11:06.791 --> 11:09.127
ORACLE: <i> Suspicious activity</i> <i>detected at the Amethyst.</i>

11:09.169 --> 11:10.462
Come on!

11:16.217 --> 11:18.345
Ew. It looks infected.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.431
(CONSOLE BEEPING)

11:21.473 --> 11:24.017
Mmm. No trace of trespassers.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.397
I saw the alert. What's the status?

11:29.439 --> 11:32.442
Breaking news, something's going on

11:29.439 --> 11:32.442
with the Amethyst.

11:32.484 --> 11:35.654
Thank you, Lois. But we have top secret

11:32.484 --> 11:35.654
matters to discuss.

11:35.694 --> 11:37.030
(BABBLES)

11:37.071 --> 11:38.823
I'm here for the top secret meeting.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.450
-How did you know? -Lois' report.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.954
I've never seen the Amethyst do this before.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.748
It could be natural. A gem fungus

11:44.996 --> 11:47.748
or parasite.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.626
But until we know what's going on,

11:49.668 --> 11:51.545
we'll post a guard around the clock.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.380
I call dibs on the first shifts.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.755
Excellent, Hawkgirl.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.799
Wonder Woman, coordinate the guard schedule.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.260
You got it, Principal Waller.

11:59.302 --> 12:02.096
We don't know what's behind this change

11:59.302 --> 12:02.096
with the Amethyst,

12:02.138 --> 12:03.764
but we need to be extra vigilant.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.600
Okay.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.353
I guess my invite to the party

12:05.642 --> 12:08.353
got lost in the mail?

12:08.395 --> 12:10.021
(GRUNTS) Big Barda!

12:10.063 --> 12:11.898
Lead warrior in the Female Furies

12:11.939 --> 12:14.693
and active in the attempt to conquer

12:11.939 --> 12:14.693
Super Hero High.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.611
Stand down, Lady Shiva.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.988
Big Barda is a student here now.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.823
Where's the hidden camera?

12:19.030 --> 12:20.823
Huh?

12:20.865 --> 12:22.492
Is this another prank, Harley?

12:22.534 --> 12:23.784
(GROANS) I wish.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.495
That would have been a doozy!

12:25.537 --> 12:28.039
Seriously? Principal Waller

12:25.537 --> 12:28.039
let her in?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.165
Mmm-hmm.

12:33.628 --> 12:35.338
Don't mind Lady Shiva.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.923
She's still smarting from that time

12:36.964 --> 12:38.508
when you brainwashed her father

12:38.550 --> 12:40.510
and, generally, threatened everything she loves.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.512
Yeah. Sorry.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.763
But whatever you need now, I'm up for it.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.641
Thanks, Barda.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.060
You can relieve Hawkgirl after her shift guarding

12:46.683 --> 12:49.060
the Amethyst.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.562
-Cool. -Really?

12:50.604 --> 12:52.855
She wants to help, and we need help.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.694
Just in case, everyone needs to be prepared.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.237
-Swords sharpened! -Hmm!

12:59.279 --> 13:00.447
-WONDER WOMAN: Electric stings charged.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.447
-(CRACKLING)

13:00.488 --> 13:02.031
Nunchuks, uh...

13:02.073 --> 13:03.283
Chucked?

13:03.324 --> 13:04.701
Batgirl, could you fix my shield?

13:04.743 --> 13:06.119
It got cracked last night.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.870
Whoops!

13:07.912 --> 13:10.039
This is beyond my expertise.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.790
You need someone who knows metal.

13:11.832 --> 13:16.003
Hmm. Sounds like a job for the master alchemist

13:11.832 --> 13:16.003
of Themyscira.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.005
Who's up for a field trip?

13:18.047 --> 13:19.466
-Right on! -Me.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.301
Can we take the Batjet?

13:21.342 --> 13:23.386
You know how freaked out my dad gets

13:21.342 --> 13:23.386
about me flying

13:23.428 --> 13:25.054
halfway around the world.

13:25.096 --> 13:28.683
Technically, Themyscira isn't halfway

13:25.096 --> 13:28.683
around the world.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.477
It's more like a third of the way.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.479
Your dad won't even have time to worry.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.397
We'll be back by lunchtime tomorrow.

13:38.817 --> 13:40.445
I'll fuel up the Batjet!

13:40.487 --> 13:41.613
I call shotgun!

13:41.655 --> 13:43.281
-All right! -Yeah, honey!

13:45.784 --> 13:46.993
Hiya, newbie!

13:47.034 --> 13:48.578
Name's Harley Quinn.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.955
You probably heard of me.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.915
-Um... -Of course you have.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.042
As our newest student, you have qualified

13:55.084 --> 13:59.714
for the spectacular, amazing, undeniably unique

13:55.084 --> 13:59.714
Harley Quinn tour.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.675
Can I get a whoopie-whoopie?

14:01.716 --> 14:03.301
-Whoopie? -Perfect.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.640
(WINGS FLAPPING)

14:17.607 --> 14:20.610
I'd like to thank my parents for being

14:17.607 --> 14:20.610
the wind beneath my wings.

14:20.652 --> 14:23.279
Or rather, for passing down the family heirloom,

14:23.321 --> 14:25.323
my Nth metal belt from Thanagar

14:25.365 --> 14:27.283
-that enables me to fly. -(GROWLING)

14:27.325 --> 14:29.118
I couldn't have won this award without it.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.411
(CLAPPING)

14:32.246 --> 14:33.707
Brava!

14:34.666 --> 14:36.543
Who are... (GRUNTS)

14:36.584 --> 14:38.044
-(BOTH GRUNTING) -(GASPS)

14:40.171 --> 14:41.631
(HAWKGIRL GRUNTS)

14:41.673 --> 14:44.133
Attacking a student, two demerits.

14:44.175 --> 14:47.637
Only two? That will never do for an overachiever

14:44.175 --> 14:47.637
like myself.

14:47.679 --> 14:49.430
-How about 200? -(BEAM TRILLS)

14:49.472 --> 14:50.515

14:52.600 --> 14:53.893
-(SIZZLING) -(MOANS)

15:02.360 --> 15:04.987
Nth metal from the planet Thanagar.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.614
What a wonderful start.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.366
(GROANS)

15:08.408 --> 15:10.535
Aunt Martha, it's just a quick trip

15:08.408 --> 15:10.535
to Themyscira.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.829
<i>As long as</i> <i>you're all still coming</i>

15:10.577 --> 15:12.829
<i>to the farm for dinner</i>

15:12.871 --> 15:14.664
<i>after the big</i> <i>awards ceremony.</i>

15:14.706 --> 15:17.667
Wouldn't miss it. Your mashed potatoes

15:14.706 --> 15:17.667
are the bomb!

15:17.709 --> 15:20.002
<i>Thank you, Bumblebee.</i>

15:20.044 --> 15:22.630
<i>Supergirl will get</i> <i>plenty of those while she's</i>

15:20.044 --> 15:22.630
<i>here over school break.</i>

15:22.672 --> 15:24.591
Oh, I don't know, Aunt Martha.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.967
Are you sure you want me there?

15:24.632 --> 15:26.967
I don't want to put you out.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.053
<i>Of course.</i>

15:29.095 --> 15:31.389
<i>Supergirl, you know</i> <i>you can make yourself</i>

15:29.095 --> 15:31.389
<i>at home with us.</i>

15:31.431 --> 15:33.015
<i>We love you, dear.</i>

15:33.057 --> 15:35.393
I, uh... I appreciate it.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.644
Bye, Aunt Martha.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.022
Talking to the Kents again?

15:40.064 --> 15:42.316
You know the drill. A call every day.

15:42.358 --> 15:43.693
Speed delivery for Supergirl!

15:43.735 --> 15:45.945
And a cookie care package every week.

15:45.986 --> 15:48.573
Lucky! I call the snickerdoodles.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.991
You may have just met the Kents

15:48.615 --> 15:50.991
a few months ago,

15:51.033 --> 15:54.913
but points to Martha for already having all

15:51.033 --> 15:54.913
your favorite foods down.

15:54.954 --> 15:58.958
(CHUCKLES) Yeah. My mom still insists that I love olives,

15:54.954 --> 15:58.958
just like she does.

15:58.999 --> 16:00.877
But olives... (GAGS)

16:00.919 --> 16:02.420
The texture. Ugh!

16:07.425 --> 16:09.343
(GROWLING)

16:19.604 --> 16:21.397
BARBARA: To Themyscira! (ALL CHEERING)

16:35.328 --> 16:38.414
-The princess has returned! -Oh, she came back! Yes!

16:38.456 --> 16:40.583
-Welcome home, princess. -This is wonderful.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.502
-Mother. -Diana.

16:42.543 --> 16:46.213
I can't stay long. I just need

16:42.543 --> 16:46.213
my shield repaired.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.925
The only one who can repair

16:46.255 --> 16:48.925
such damage

16:48.967 --> 16:51.719
to Themysciran ore is the master alchemist.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.180
It will be my honor, Princess.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.557
Come on, I want to show you guys my home.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.351
Home.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.773
-(DOG BARKING) -(HORSE WHINNYING)

17:03.815 --> 17:05.274
Mom.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.735
Welcome home, Kara. How was your ride?

17:09.195 --> 17:10.947
(CHUCKLES)

17:10.989 --> 17:13.324
Amazing. We found this.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.326
A Mnemosyne crystal.

17:15.368 --> 17:18.830
(GASPS) Once we get this polished,

17:15.368 --> 17:18.830
it will be very powerful.

17:23.417 --> 17:24.752
BUMBLEBEE: Hurry up, Supergirl!

17:24.794 --> 17:26.963
I hear the ambrosia here is delish.

17:27.005 --> 17:28.589
Um, coming.

17:35.013 --> 17:37.139
And that's the royal spa.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.474
Sweet.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.601
(GASPING) Is that a pedicure chair?

17:40.643 --> 17:43.730
My toes are totes in need of some TLC.

17:43.771 --> 17:47.107
Hey, Batgirl, I think there's something weird

17:43.771 --> 17:47.107
with my necklace.

17:47.149 --> 17:50.194
I touched the Mnemosyne crystal

17:47.149 --> 17:50.194
and saw something.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.320
Krypton.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.780
Interesting.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.448
I can do some tests when we get home.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.200
Supergirl, over here!

17:56.242 --> 17:58.494
If you stay here during school break,

17:56.242 --> 17:58.494
this will be your room.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.538
Oh, yeah. Nice.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.790
I thought you'd stay at the Kents

18:00.580 --> 18:02.790
over the holiday.

18:02.832 --> 18:04.083
I haven't decided.

18:04.124 --> 18:05.960
I mean they say I'm welcome,

18:06.002 --> 18:07.670
but maybe they're just being nice.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.380
I don't want to be a charity project.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.215
Come on, the throne room is this way.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.721
Diana, you're skipping over the best room.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.473
Mom, they don't want to see that.

18:19.515 --> 18:20.850
(WHISPERS) It's embarrassing.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.351
Embarrassing?

18:22.393 --> 18:24.062
Well, now we have to see it.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.480
Lead the way, Miss Queen Hippolyta.

18:29.316 --> 18:30.359
(GROANS)

18:38.242 --> 18:41.370
Whoa. This room is gleamin'.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.163
Are all these awards yours?

18:43.205 --> 18:46.375
-Well, you know... -These are just

18:43.205 --> 18:46.375
from the past year.

18:46.417 --> 18:48.878
We had to build a whole wing on the other side

18:46.417 --> 18:48.878
of the palace

18:48.920 --> 18:51.130
for Diana's elementary school honors.

18:51.171 --> 18:52.548
Come, look at this.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.634
It's the key to the city of Metropolis.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.260
Wow.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.345
And I thought that my dad driving around with that

18:58.387 --> 18:59.931
"My daughter is Hero of the Month

18:59.973 --> 19:02.308
"at Super Hero High" bumper sticker was bad.

19:02.349 --> 19:05.352
Shh. Don't let my mom know those exist.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.313
She'll plaster her chariot with them.

19:07.354 --> 19:09.398
Diana, I want to show you something.

19:10.357 --> 19:11.484
Wow!

19:11.525 --> 19:13.235
An invisible trophy?

19:13.277 --> 19:16.114
No. This is where we'll put the Hero of the Year trophy.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.116
But I haven't won yet.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.742
The competition is really fierce.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.243
I think Bumblebee has a good chance.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.079
Girl, look around you.

19:23.121 --> 19:25.581
You got the Hero of the Year prize in the bag.

19:25.623 --> 19:27.917
Precisely. And to celebrate, we feast.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.085
Come along, girls.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.172
Aw, Mom.

19:38.803 --> 19:41.388
Who wants olives? Diana?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.683
Mom, I don't like olives.

19:43.724 --> 19:47.103
Since when? It's in our blood

19:43.724 --> 19:47.103
to like olives.

19:47.145 --> 19:49.563
-More for me. -(ALL CHUCKLE)

I wish it serves you well in your quest to win

19:59.032 --> 20:03.036
the Hero of the Year award.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.787
Of course, she'll win.

20:04.829 --> 20:07.456
I was going to give you a gift after tomorrow's ceremony

20:07.498 --> 20:09.333
but why wait? Come.

22:10.288 --> 22:13.373
Your third period forensics teacher told me

22:10.288 --> 22:13.373
you missed class.

Dad, you're my third period forensics teacher.

22:16.836 --> 22:20.006
You knew I had an off-campus pass

22:16.836 --> 22:20.006
from Principal Waller.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.716
Well, I approved that before the hullabaloo

22:22.758 --> 22:24.927

22:24.969 --> 22:26.762

22:26.804 --> 22:29.265
Big Barda found Hawkgirl unconscious.

22:29.307 --> 22:31.309
Apparently, someone came out of the Amethyst

22:39.608 --> 22:42.903
stole Hawkgirl's belt.

22:42.945 --> 22:45.323
Plus something stole Wonder Woman's ruby.

22:45.363 --> 22:47.783
That makes two cases of grand larceny.

22:47.825 --> 22:50.828
Hawkgirl! Principal Waller said you were resting

22:47.825 --> 22:50.828

Get this, our Amethyst is an old portal to Gemworld.

23:43.463 --> 23:45.091
It's been inactive for decades.

than a villain.

23:53.557 --> 23:57.603
Yo, Dark Opal's a legit wickedy-wack

23:53.557 --> 23:57.603

No! You have to come with me!

It's almost like Morse Code.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.444
Could be signaling someone.

25:28.486 --> 25:31.864
My mom said she gave me the crystal so she could

25:28.486 --> 25:31.864
always be with me.

25:31.905 --> 25:34.574
Maybe she programmed it so when she got

25:31.905 --> 25:34.574
off Krypton

25:34.616 --> 25:36.243
she could find me.

25:36.285 --> 25:39.872
But weren't your parents on Krypton when the planet,

25:39.913 --> 25:42.500

25:42.540 --> 25:43.750
Maybe not.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.961
They were really smart scientists.

25:46.003 --> 25:47.880
Maybe they built another ship.

25:47.921 --> 25:50.757
Supergirl, we should wait until we can learn more

25:50.799 --> 25:52.510

25:52.550 --> 25:54.470
I have to tell Martha and Jonathan!

My parents are coming for me!

25:58.682 --> 26:00.934
And it's a signal!

26:00.976 --> 26:04.480
If it just started doing this, that means someone

26:00.976 --> 26:04.480

31:47.573 --> 31:50.576
galloping through a field on her way to meet

31:47.573 --> 31:50.576
her gal pals for lunch.

31:52.452 --> 31:55.539
Cheetah, please. I said gazelle in field.

31:55.581 --> 31:58.584
You're doing more of a wildebeest trumping through

31:55.581 --> 31:58.584

32:17.603 --> 32:20.063
I found Big Barda trying to leave school grounds.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.981
She must be the one behind this.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.734
I was just out for a walk.

32:23.776 --> 32:25.193
Lady Shiva,

32:25.235 --> 32:27.195
do you have evidence for your accusations?

32:27.237 --> 32:30.031
The Amethyst was infiltrated the night of her arrival

32:30.073 --> 32:34.787
and she's the one that so conveniently found Hawkgirl

32:30.073 --> 32:34.787
after she was attacked.

32:34.828 --> 32:37.372
Hard evidence, Lady Shiva?

32:37.414 --> 32:40.667
Not yet. But I won't stand by and let my school,

32:40.709 --> 32:42.920
my friends, be invaded again.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.213

33:51.780 --> 33:53.740
Can you confirm the identity of the villain?

33:53.782 --> 33:55.993
Is it true that the villain came out of the Amethyst?

34:03.583 --> 34:07.045
