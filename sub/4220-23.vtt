WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:03.127
I need you to
look me in the eye
and tell me

00:03.212 --> 00:05.171
that your mask malfunctioned
on that call.

00:05.255 --> 00:07.382
I swear to you,
my mask was not working.

00:07.925 --> 00:10.176
Rice was ducking,
and no one on Squad
gives a crap!

00:10.260 --> 00:12.011
Hey, hey, hey!

00:12.096 --> 00:13.346
You need to get
your guys in line.

00:13.430 --> 00:16.224
That's always
a great move, drawing lines
between Truck and Squad.

00:16.308 --> 00:18.434
Yeah, and you better
keep Truck on
their side of the fence.

00:18.769 --> 00:21.688
Your buddy, Jack Nesbitt.
He's into
some nasty business.

00:21.772 --> 00:24.774
These guys traffic
eastern European women
against their will.

00:24.858 --> 00:25.858
Tell me how I can help.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.777
Behind the battery,
listening device.

00:28.904 --> 00:29.904
Let me see your phone.

00:56.640 --> 00:57.640
He's clear.

01:00.894 --> 01:01.894
Unbelievable.

01:03.105 --> 01:04.897
Let's get Matt
a drink here.

01:04.982 --> 01:06.274
I'm fine.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.737
Okay. We're opening five
more clubs and our investors
want to know

01:10.821 --> 01:12.655
if you'll accept cash.

01:12.823 --> 01:16.701
We're also willing
to allow an extra
five percent in markups

01:16.785 --> 01:17.994
if you do
the work off book.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.163
I know this sounds
a little shady,

01:20.247 --> 01:22.749
but it's all about our
cash-on-hand right now...

01:24.835 --> 01:25.918
What happened?
We lost you?

01:27.004 --> 01:30.006
Your wire's in the toilet.
You're welcome to dig it out.

01:32.426 --> 01:35.428
Something didn't feel right.
So I ducked into the bathroom
and flushed it.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.722
Good thing,
they frisked me.

01:38.515 --> 01:41.184
Opened up the back,
the works.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.310
Damn.

01:44.480 --> 01:46.230
They're worried about ATF.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.523
ATF?

01:47.566 --> 01:49.776
I'll look into it.
They talked about
cash for construction.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.986
Didn't say a word to me
about anything illegal.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.071
Casey.
This is a process.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.907
These guys are smart.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.743
We regroup, hit 'em again.
Just gotta have patience.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.372
You did good.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.757
I got a confession
to make.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.009
Yeah?

02:16.386 --> 02:17.720
I can be a jerk.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.100
That's about right, yeah.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.561
Look, I know the rumors
that fly around CFD
about me.

02:26.104 --> 02:29.273
And the ones
that fly around here.
I'm no ducker, Kelly.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.151
Man to man,
I can do this job.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.570
I shouldn't have said
what I said to you
the other day

02:34.655 --> 02:35.988
about our friendship.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.366
I was frustrated, and...

02:40.327 --> 02:41.577
Look, I apologize.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.748
I got your back,
you know that.

02:48.085 --> 02:51.546
Yeah, I know. Yeah.
More than anyone.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.090
What?

03:36.884 --> 03:37.925
What what?

03:38.010 --> 03:40.303
You haven't said two words
to me all morning.

03:40.387 --> 03:43.222
Now I'm not allowed
to be contemplative
and asocial?

03:43.307 --> 03:47.184
No, you're not.
You're supposed to be
dense and lovable.

03:47.311 --> 03:48.895
Dense?
In a lovable way.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.521
I am not dense.

03:50.939 --> 03:54.442
Fair enough.
But it's anti-social,
not asocial.

03:56.778 --> 04:01.198
The most I'd done up
to that point was, uh,
under the sweater over bra.

04:01.825 --> 04:02.909
And, uh...

04:05.954 --> 04:10.041
So, um... So Severide and I,
we, uh, we hatch a plan...

04:16.673 --> 04:18.007
What're you gonna
do about Rice?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.258
What's that mean?

04:19.343 --> 04:21.260
No one is gunning
for him here.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.095
And if Otis thinks
he's ducking, then...

04:23.180 --> 04:24.680
He wasn't ducking.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.142
You wanna
believe that, fine.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.437
But 51 isn't 51 right now
and it's because of him.
That's a fact.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.397
Casey. Drop it.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.737
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.239
Gas leak.
6111 South Mayfield.

04:49.706 --> 04:53.000
There's a smell of gas
coming from 6111.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.294
An elderly woman
by the name of Edna Miller
lives there,

04:55.379 --> 04:56.545
but she's out of town
for the week.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.130
I can smell it
from here.

04:58.215 --> 04:59.465
Anyone else live here?

04:59.633 --> 05:00.633
Just her and her dog.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.052
There's no shutoff outside.
It must be in the basement.

05:03.553 --> 05:08.057
Truck 81 to Main. We need
the gas company to
6111 South Mayfield. ASAP.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.767
Message received,
Truck 81.

05:09.851 --> 05:12.269
Hey, guys. Grab your mask
and a four-gas monitor.

05:12.396 --> 05:13.813
We'll go to the rear,
check levels.

05:13.897 --> 05:14.897
Take readings in front.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.023
Got it.

05:27.828 --> 05:31.330
We're over 100%
of lower explosive limit.
Oxygen is under 19%.

05:31.415 --> 05:32.373
Should we vent?

05:32.457 --> 05:33.749
No, no, hold up.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.876
The only reason why
this place hasn't
exploded yet

05:35.961 --> 05:37.795
is the gas is
too rich to burn.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.214
Oh, my God!
Is Edna okay?

05:40.298 --> 05:42.550
Uh, ma'am, it's fine.
It's just a gas leak.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.093
Mailman said the lady
is out of town.

05:44.219 --> 05:46.721
No, she's in there.
She came home last night!

05:48.765 --> 05:51.058
Uh... Hey.
Uh, Squad 3 to Main.

05:51.143 --> 05:52.727
What's the ETA
on the gas company?

05:52.811 --> 05:54.186
10 minutes out.

05:54.271 --> 05:56.105
Hey. Let's go get her.

05:56.940 --> 05:57.940
Yeah?

05:59.401 --> 06:00.693
Mask up.
We are going in.

06:00.777 --> 06:01.777
Here.

06:01.987 --> 06:05.281
Hey, Casey,
there's a woman inside.
We're going in.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.743
Severide, do not enter.
We're getting
high readings here.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.161
This place will explode.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.579
Negative, we're going in.

06:11.663 --> 06:14.832
LEL readings are high.
Wait for the gas company.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.169
Ready?
Let's do this.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.922
Tony, hit it! Go!

06:25.469 --> 06:26.469
We're in.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.471
We need to get
into the basement and
shut off the gas before

06:28.555 --> 06:30.014
Squad blows this
place to hell.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.307
I got this.

06:32.476 --> 06:34.602
All right, Otis.
You gotta move fast!
Strike!

06:38.982 --> 06:41.484
You gotta move, Severide!
You're running out of time.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.370
Truck, stand by!

06:54.247 --> 06:55.456
Gas levels are high.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.666
Squad's around back
and Severide's inside,
looking for a woman.

06:57.751 --> 06:58.751
Are you kidding me?

06:58.835 --> 07:01.045
I've got Otis inside
looking for the meter
to shut off the gas.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.257
Capp, what's the status?

07:05.342 --> 07:06.926
We're in the
explosive range, Chief.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.721
Severide, Otis,
get out now!

07:11.181 --> 07:13.599
Not good, not good.
This place is going
to go, Lieutenant.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.476
Chief, we need
to pull back!

07:15.560 --> 07:17.436
I found the gas meter.
Gas is off!

07:17.521 --> 07:18.687
Take the windows.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.163
Hey, you okay, bud?
Yeah.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.167
Her lungs sound good.
Okay.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.545
Well, what was that?

07:46.299 --> 07:48.467
Truck and Squad, right?
You just do what
the hell you want now.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.386
You could've killed us
by venting in there,
you know that.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.471
Otis shutting off the gas
and us venting

07:52.556 --> 07:55.057
is the only reason
this whole house
didn't explode.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.434
Otis is the elevator guy.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.019
What the hell was he
doing in the house at all?

07:59.104 --> 08:00.229
Stop!

08:08.238 --> 08:10.698
Pack up the gear,
get back to quarters
right now.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.847
Otis. What're you doing?

09:18.099 --> 09:20.226
Just sitting with my
brothers, Lieutenant.

09:20.310 --> 09:23.687
I thought this was
Firehouse 51.
Not the kingdom of Squad 3.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.377
We need gas.
Let's load back up.

10:09.985 --> 10:13.320
Cruz. Pull up a chair, man.

10:14.531 --> 10:15.572
Yeah, sure.

10:26.710 --> 10:29.837
Jessica, package for you.

10:29.921 --> 10:31.588
You know, you
can call me Chili.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.007
No.

10:36.553 --> 10:37.761
Oh, my God.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.098
It's here.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.560
Okay! Let's see that baby.

10:44.894 --> 10:45.894
Okay, I can't.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.272
All right!

10:48.356 --> 10:49.398
Hey, easy!

10:49.482 --> 10:51.108
It's okay! I got it.
I got it. I got it.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.318
Careful.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.033
Look at that.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.243
You wanna
give it a whirl?

11:08.251 --> 11:09.418
Oh, my gosh.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.172
Okay.

11:17.802 --> 11:18.802
Whoa.

11:21.473 --> 11:22.848
That's so cool.

11:29.773 --> 11:30.814
To Chilleeze!

11:34.444 --> 11:35.444
And?

11:38.365 --> 11:42.785
It works.
It really works!
It really works!

11:42.952 --> 11:43.911
That's real champagne.

11:43.995 --> 11:45.287
I know!

11:45.455 --> 11:46.497
And it's cold.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.290
That's kinda
the point, Mouch!

11:49.959 --> 11:54.380
Oh, this is gonna be huge.
And I've been thinking
about this a lot.

11:54.464 --> 11:58.050
And there's just one
piece of the puzzle that's
gonna put this over the edge.

12:00.595 --> 12:03.263
Celebrity spokesperson.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.685
I've seen it all
since I've been here.

12:09.896 --> 12:15.692
Haven't always dealt with it
with the grace and the class
that I would like, but I try.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.822
We have
all this animosity.

12:20.532 --> 12:23.158
You can't have animosity
in a house, it's a killer.

12:24.619 --> 12:25.702
But what do I tell them?

12:26.246 --> 12:29.957
Get in their faces,
tell 'em stop acting like
a bunch of damn babies?

12:30.250 --> 12:33.377
Or do I give yet another
speech about togetherness
and family?

12:36.297 --> 12:37.506
I don't know, Donna.

12:38.842 --> 12:41.427
I'm beginning to wonder
if I can still lead
this house.

12:43.054 --> 12:44.888
They stopped listening.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.893
Wallace. Hey.

12:51.688 --> 12:54.523
Why are you using words
when you have you?

12:56.901 --> 12:59.653
Sorry to bother you, Chief,
but Lieutenant Casey
has something

12:59.737 --> 13:02.197
he needs to
talk to you about.
Says it's important.

13:09.414 --> 13:10.414
Hey, Chief.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.542
What's going on?

13:13.835 --> 13:15.544
The construction job
Casey is on,

13:15.628 --> 13:18.547
we're investigating the club
for human trafficking,
money laundering.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.383
We've tried to
squeeze some UCs
in there, but, no dice.

13:21.593 --> 13:24.094
They want me wired up
so we can get these
guys on tape.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.556
You're putting one of
my men undercover?

13:27.640 --> 13:31.143
He's been a valuable asset.
Believe me, we got his back.

13:31.561 --> 13:36.231
Chief, the girl I know
who works there,
she's scared of something.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.234
And Jack Nesbitt
gives all firefighters
a bad name.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.737
If I can help,
I wanna help.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.656
I want to take
next shift off.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.743
I can make
a difference here.

13:55.627 --> 13:58.170
Okay.
Do what you gotta do.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.105
Hey, man. You know,
I just want you to know,

14:17.190 --> 14:21.360
uh, whatever happens
out there, or in here,
or whatever...

14:21.444 --> 14:23.362
Am I really just
the elevator guy?

14:23.446 --> 14:24.655
Of course not.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.949
Does everybody think that,
or just the Squad a-holes?

14:27.075 --> 14:29.910
Otis, man, don't.
God, I can't stand
those guys.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.371
Hey! Otis! Wait up. Hey!
Yeah?

14:36.084 --> 14:37.626
We need
a good elevator man.

14:50.765 --> 14:53.058
How long is Truck
gonna keep this up?

14:53.142 --> 14:54.226
I don't have time
for this right now.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.602
Yeah, make time.

14:55.979 --> 14:59.273
I don't mind catching flack,
and I don't mind
confrontation.

15:00.066 --> 15:03.485
What I do mind
is a bunch of guys
making false accusations

15:03.611 --> 15:05.195
and trying to
railroad one of my men
out of here.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.655
One of your old friends,
you mean.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.240
That has nothing
to do with it.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.325
That has everything
to do with this!

15:11.953 --> 15:14.705
You're blind, because of your
friendship with this guy.

15:14.789 --> 15:16.790
Okay.
You're looking the other way
and letting him skate.

15:16.874 --> 15:20.711
I'm not blind, Casey.
I'm just not gonna go
pissing on a firefighter

15:20.795 --> 15:21.753
who has proven himself.

15:21.838 --> 15:22.963
Did you even check
his story?

15:23.047 --> 15:24.756
No, I didn't check his story.
I take him at his word.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.633
There it is,
right there.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.594
The gospel according
to Severide.

15:28.678 --> 15:32.014
You know what? Honestly?
Go screw yourself.
I'm sick of it.

15:32.432 --> 15:35.309
Maybe you ought to listen
to the guy who took you in
when you were on your ass.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.060
Yeah, I liked that guy
a whole lot better

15:37.145 --> 15:38.645
when he wasn't
a sanctimonious prick.

15:43.818 --> 15:46.778
Hey, hey.
Come on, forget him.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.030
Squad doesn't
own this house.

15:48.114 --> 15:51.033
And I would listen to Otis
over Rice all day long.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.368
Yeah.
What's wrong?

15:53.786 --> 15:55.412
Nothing.
I just I feel terrible.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.789
It's just the weather,
it's been up and down.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.708
It's got my system
all messed up.

16:01.002 --> 16:05.005
Okay. Well, I'm off
next shift, so if you
gotta call in sick,

16:05.465 --> 16:07.132
let Boden know ASAP.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.842
Police business?
Yeah.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.344
You being careful?

16:10.803 --> 16:12.596
Oh, yeah.
You know me.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.723
Yeah, that's the problem.
I do know you.

16:19.228 --> 16:22.022
Anything?
Don't you think I would
tell you if I saw something?

16:25.735 --> 16:27.110
I saw something.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.949
Scottie Pippen! Ooh.

16:50.760 --> 16:54.096
Hi, I'm a paramedic for
the Chicago Fire Department.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.389
Is anybody hurt
down there?

16:55.473 --> 16:57.849
Wow. That was fast.
No, I'm fine.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.352
Okay, great. Well, we're
working on the problem
out here.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.478
Thanks.

17:01.562 --> 17:04.898
Mr. Pippen, I gotta tell you,
I've been a huge fan of yours
for years.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.024
Thanks!

17:06.109 --> 17:08.610
Yeah! I've seen nearly every
goal you ever scored.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.278
Goal?

17:11.948 --> 17:16.743
So, tell me, Mr. Pippen,
how do you feel about
perfectly chilled champagne?

17:18.287 --> 17:19.788
What the hell is
going on here?

17:32.468 --> 17:33.468
He's in.

17:33.678 --> 17:34.803
Ah!

17:43.146 --> 17:44.312
Hello?

18:00.121 --> 18:02.164
I gotta tell you
the truth here, Jack.

18:02.999 --> 18:06.460
I'm feeling more and more
like I'm walking into
some dark alleys.

18:08.671 --> 18:11.256
If something is going on,
I don't want any part of it.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.302
What do you think
is going on?

18:15.386 --> 18:17.345
I don't know.
That's why I'm asking.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.768
Matt!
Give us a minute, please.

18:33.529 --> 18:37.324
Hey.
Relax, man.
Please. Come on.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.534
This is SOP in the
nightclub business.

18:39.619 --> 18:43.914
Especially in Chicago.
Shakedowns, scrutiny,
it's all part of it.

18:43.998 --> 18:46.750
I used to get worked up
about it just like you,
but now...

18:47.794 --> 18:49.544
Your backers seem
a little more concerned.

18:49.629 --> 18:54.382
Oh. These Eastern European
guys think
everyone's a boogeyman.

19:00.139 --> 19:04.392
Let me
ask you something, Matt.
You been approached?

19:05.895 --> 19:07.187
By who?
You tell me.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.898
ATF? CPD?

19:10.983 --> 19:12.067
No.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.486
You sure?

19:16.447 --> 19:20.659
I need to know that
you're not running your mouth
outside these walls.

19:20.868 --> 19:24.830
Jack. You know
what I'm running?

19:28.918 --> 19:30.293
A construction crew.

19:39.095 --> 19:42.305
Okay. Well, listen.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.975
We have, uh,
one more meeting
with my partners.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.894
Can you come back
up here tomorrow,
say 5:00 p.m.?

19:47.979 --> 19:50.730
Yeah. Sure.
Great, I'll see you then.

19:51.274 --> 19:53.275
All right.
I'll walk out with you.

19:54.819 --> 19:59.030
Actually, I'd like to
speak with you, Katya.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.576
I'll see you, Matt.
Five o'clock.

20:03.411 --> 20:04.619
Five o'clock.

20:13.588 --> 20:15.589
Hey, bud,
you seen Jerry?

20:16.173 --> 20:17.299
Jerry!

20:18.301 --> 20:19.968
Kelly! How you been?

20:20.094 --> 20:21.678
I'm good!
How's your old man?

20:21.762 --> 20:24.556
He's, uh...
Ah, you know him,
he's the same.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.141
I could tell you
some stories.

20:26.225 --> 20:29.978
Yeah, I've heard 'em all.
Listen, one of my guys
brought in a regulator

20:30.146 --> 20:32.355
a few shifts ago.
I was just wondering
how it looked.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.773
51, right?
Yeah.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.487
There's nothing come
through here from 51.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.198
We got maybe
a K-12 saw.

20:42.283 --> 20:43.533
That was seven,
eight months ago.

20:43.618 --> 20:45.660
No, I'm talking
about a regulator.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.288
No, I understand.
Didn't come through here.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.623
You sure?

20:49.707 --> 20:52.542
Birthdays, anniversaries.
Those I forget.

20:52.627 --> 20:54.544
Equipment serviced here?
Never.

20:54.629 --> 20:57.339
No one from 51 dropped
off a regulator, Kelly.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.603
Shut the door.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.696
I went to Air Mask
and spoke to Jerry.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.698
You never took
your regulator in.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.909
Uh, sure I did.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.536
No, you didn't.
And you lied to my face.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.083
No...
Don't, don't.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.295
You're off Squad 3,
effective immediately.

21:43.511 --> 21:46.262
What? That's it? You don't
wanna hear my side?
You have a side?

21:52.019 --> 21:53.979
Look, since Angie died,
it's, uh...

21:56.440 --> 21:57.983
I'm all Logan's got, Kelly.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.571
And after the
Chicago Med incident,

22:04.323 --> 22:10.036
you know, I started to
think about him and what if
he lost both of us? Hmm?

22:16.377 --> 22:17.711
He'd be an orphan.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.213
With no one to raise him.

22:21.716 --> 22:24.843
Scott, there's a lot of
men with families
in the CFD.

22:27.179 --> 22:31.057
But everyone, when they
report for this job,
puts it all out there.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.101
Everyone.

22:35.104 --> 22:36.938
You weren't ready, Scott.

22:38.524 --> 22:39.774
You just weren't.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.445
That's it?

22:44.989 --> 22:46.698
Pink slip and see you later?

22:55.124 --> 22:56.332
Yeah.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.148
Okay, everybody, listen up.

23:25.654 --> 23:28.656
Scott Rice has just been
dismissed from Firehouse 51.

23:36.123 --> 23:39.292
And I am not gonna
kick a man while he is
down, so...

23:40.002 --> 23:43.713
Leave it to say,
his family situation got in
the way of his work here.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.887
So, Cruz, will you stand
up here for me, please?

23:53.766 --> 23:55.934
It's recently been
reported to me

23:56.685 --> 23:59.646
that Joe Cruz completed
his Squad Certification
last week.

24:03.818 --> 24:04.818
What?

24:07.029 --> 24:13.159
Since we now have an opening,
it is my honor to welcome
Joe Cruz to Squad 3.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.373
Joe...

24:22.503 --> 24:23.628
Make us proud.

24:24.922 --> 24:28.842
Thank you, Chief.
I will. I promise.

24:33.389 --> 24:34.764
What the hell are you
doing, man?

24:35.641 --> 24:38.726
Brian, you are now
the driver of Truck 81.

24:43.691 --> 24:48.820
Since Casey's gone, uh,
who's gonna be
Acting Lieutenant?

24:49.280 --> 24:52.699
I am. Anybody got
an issue with that?

24:54.034 --> 24:55.034
Good.

24:56.829 --> 25:00.039
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61,

25:00.166 --> 25:03.459
Truck 64, Truck 70,
Ambulance 96...
Here we go.

25:03.544 --> 25:05.670
Warehouse fire,
1400 North Cordon Street.

25:12.261 --> 25:13.469
What? You couldn't
have said something?

25:14.305 --> 25:17.265
After all this,
you're joining them.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.435
Otis, you driving or what?

25:20.603 --> 25:22.854
Yeah, let's go.

25:35.409 --> 25:37.619
Hey, Cruz, do your job.

26:06.857 --> 26:08.149
Chief Weiss, where are we?

26:08.234 --> 26:10.902
Wallace and company's
in there doing search
and rescue on civilians,

26:10.986 --> 26:12.153
but we lost control
of the fire.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.238
You evacuate?

26:13.322 --> 26:15.949
I ordered it,
but two from Truck 65
haven't made it out.

26:16.158 --> 26:18.284
Two civilians unaccounted
for too, Chief.

26:18.369 --> 26:20.745
Right. Severide!
Breach the north door,

26:20.829 --> 26:22.330
see if you can reach
the two from Truck 65.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.498
You got
two minutes, tops.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.251
All right, let's grab
a line and head in.
Cruz, stay on Tony's hip.

26:26.335 --> 26:27.293
Copy.

26:27.378 --> 26:30.630
Truck 81, with me.
Recon the perimeter.
Let's find another way in!

26:44.603 --> 26:46.479
Help!

26:48.315 --> 26:50.024
Help!

26:57.366 --> 26:58.950
Help!

26:59.034 --> 27:00.743
Hang tight! We're coming in.

27:01.245 --> 27:02.912
This opening's too small.

27:03.414 --> 27:04.664
I'll go!

27:07.710 --> 27:11.629
Hey, where are
the civilians?

27:11.880 --> 27:12.964
They're further in.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.757
- Cruz!
- Yeah, got him.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.760
Guys,
get him out of here.
Get him on air.

27:17.845 --> 27:19.053
Copy that!

27:27.354 --> 27:28.813
Get on the floor.

27:30.024 --> 27:32.650
All right. Two pulls when
you're ready, got it?

27:32.776 --> 27:34.235
Copy that.

27:38.574 --> 27:40.575
Okay. Let's get
this window off.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.538
Squad's coming out
with the two firefighters.

27:46.248 --> 27:47.415
We need a medic!

27:57.051 --> 27:58.426
Two tugs.
Let's get her out.

27:59.970 --> 28:01.095
Okay.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.602
Dawson, where are you?

28:07.686 --> 28:08.895
Chief, the room's
lighting up.

28:08.979 --> 28:10.355
I can't get back
to the window.

28:10.439 --> 28:11.814
Heading to the front.

28:13.817 --> 28:15.109
To the front, now!

28:19.740 --> 28:21.616
Cruz, where's Severide?

28:22.117 --> 28:24.452
He went for the civilians.
It's too late, Chief.

28:47.142 --> 28:49.227
Chief, Chief, I'm out of air.

28:49.812 --> 28:51.854
Chief, my tank is empty.

28:55.317 --> 28:59.237
Everybody stop. Stop!
No matter what happens,
no one from House 51,

28:59.321 --> 29:00.947
they go into that building.

29:05.452 --> 29:06.869
This is not a democracy!

29:07.579 --> 29:09.956
I am in charge!
Do you understand?

29:13.836 --> 29:15.211
We hear you.

29:17.798 --> 29:18.798
Good!

29:23.762 --> 29:24.762
Chief!

29:47.911 --> 29:50.913
Hey, Dawson! Hey!
What the hell
are you doing?

29:53.750 --> 29:55.543
This guy is unconscious!

29:58.380 --> 30:00.173
This guy,
he's unconscious.
Here.

30:06.054 --> 30:09.307
He's not unconscious,
Dawson, he's dead!
No, no, he was breathing.

30:09.391 --> 30:12.727
He's gone, Dawson.
Come on. You tried your best.
Let's go.

30:15.063 --> 30:16.230
Get up! Come on!

30:28.202 --> 30:29.952
Stay low.
Yeah.

30:39.755 --> 30:41.255
Hey, in here!

30:54.102 --> 30:55.102
Dawson!

31:02.069 --> 31:03.569
We're out of air.

31:09.076 --> 31:11.536
What do you think?
Won't deliver enough water
to get us out of here.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.913
Yeah, but we can get
some air from it, right?

31:13.997 --> 31:15.164
Yeah.

31:21.797 --> 31:23.005
That's it!
I'm calling it.

31:23.090 --> 31:25.174
Wheatley, get ready to
hit the building
from the river.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.634
Tower ladders,
on my signal!

31:26.802 --> 31:27.802
That will cook
anyone in there!

31:27.886 --> 31:29.387
There's no way they have
any air left.

31:29.471 --> 31:31.055
And that hose line isn't
big enough to get 'em out.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.516
I'm cutting off the water
and sending it
to the tower ladder.

31:33.642 --> 31:36.561
Chief, they could be alive
and breathing off that
hose for all we know!

31:36.645 --> 31:38.646
I'm not looking
for opinions, son.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.189
Well, then you take
my badge, Chief.

31:40.315 --> 31:42.483
You take my uniform,
you take my pension,
whatever you want,

31:42.609 --> 31:45.403
but you are not
shutting down that line!

31:56.582 --> 31:58.833
Chief, give 'em two more
minutes, please.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.793
Can't do it.

32:03.297 --> 32:05.089
Then you're gonna have
to go through me.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.304
Cut the water going inside.

32:11.388 --> 32:14.265
All engine companies,
hit the building.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.935
No! No, no! No!
You can't do that!
You'll roast them!

32:18.020 --> 32:20.479
All right. Come on.
You'll roast them! No!

32:25.527 --> 32:27.945
Hey! Hey, hey!

32:51.511 --> 32:52.762
They think
we're cooked.

32:57.267 --> 32:58.768
I'm sorry.

33:35.138 --> 33:36.681
Severide! Dawson!

34:06.461 --> 34:07.545
Chief, you okay?

34:07.629 --> 34:08.796
I'm fine.

34:10.132 --> 34:12.091
Yeah.
Chief.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.467
You okay?

34:21.351 --> 34:22.351
Thank you.

34:50.130 --> 34:51.130
Chief Tiberg.

34:51.840 --> 34:54.675
It has been brought to
my attention, Wallace,
that one of your firefighters

34:54.760 --> 34:58.179
threatened Battalion Chief
Dan Weiss with violence
at the blaze today.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.640
I need a name, Chief. Now.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.524
I did it.
No, Otis.

35:11.318 --> 35:14.862
Yep, it was me.
No, it was me.

35:15.363 --> 35:16.530
Well, who was it?

35:16.782 --> 35:18.115
It was me.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.203
I did it, Chief.

35:23.038 --> 35:24.038
I did it.

35:25.499 --> 35:26.832
It was me.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.418
I did it.

35:29.503 --> 35:30.503
I did it.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.339
What is this?

35:35.258 --> 35:37.051
You don't think I can find
out who it was?

35:38.220 --> 35:41.055
Yeah, I do.
But I gotta ask.

35:42.724 --> 35:44.391
Why the hell would
you want to?

35:50.732 --> 35:51.732
Firehouse 51!

36:11.545 --> 36:13.212
Come here.
Come here.

36:13.797 --> 36:18.050
Oh, my God!
A call like that,
all that intensity?

36:19.761 --> 36:22.763
I've seen it a million
times, someone's totally
hooking up tonight.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.348
What? No!

36:24.432 --> 36:26.183
Volcanoes need to
let off steam.

36:26.268 --> 36:28.686
And this place has been
a volcano for weeks.

36:28.770 --> 36:29.812
Trust me.

36:29.938 --> 36:33.107
All right, okay,
as much as it pains me,

36:33.483 --> 36:36.861
everybody gets one free drink
at Molly's tonight! Yay!

36:36.945 --> 36:37.945
Yeah!

36:42.450 --> 36:44.660
You know Doug Purcell
in the 28th?
Uh-huh.

36:45.245 --> 36:47.788
Well, he's got a time
share in the Bahamas and
if he doesn't use it...

36:47.914 --> 36:51.041
Oh! Whoa!
What's that about
the Bahamas now?

36:51.126 --> 36:53.043
Hey, a buddy of mine's
got a time share in Nassau.

36:53.128 --> 36:55.796
He's gotta use it
for a week in June,
or he loses the deposit.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.631
How many slots
you got open?

36:58.341 --> 36:59.341
Are you interested?

36:59.426 --> 37:00.968
I'm interested.

37:05.682 --> 37:06.682
Here we go.

37:08.143 --> 37:09.143
Thanks.

37:10.562 --> 37:13.063
Hey, you...
You weren't worried,
were you, Dawson?

37:13.231 --> 37:17.943
Oh, no! With a big
strong Squad guy there to
save me? Of course not.

37:25.201 --> 37:27.494
You've, um,
you heard from Casey?

37:28.038 --> 37:29.830
I tried his cell,
but he hasn't
called me back.

37:30.457 --> 37:32.082
Oh, did you tell him
to get his ass down here?

37:32.167 --> 37:34.668
Yeah, those were
my exact words,
actually.

37:36.338 --> 37:37.922
This is gonna be weird.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.299
You really gonna sit
at the Squad table?

37:40.383 --> 37:42.801
He worked hard.
Nights, weekends.

37:43.970 --> 37:47.848
And he was willing
to give it all up today
for his brothers.

37:58.902 --> 38:01.528
Hey, what you
did today...

38:03.657 --> 38:05.324
Spartacus would've
been proud.

38:07.077 --> 38:08.702
Why didn't you
tell me, man?

38:10.664 --> 38:11.914
I didn't know how to.

38:13.166 --> 38:15.542
After Sylvie and me
broke up, I just...

38:16.419 --> 38:17.878
I had to challenge myself.

38:19.881 --> 38:20.881
Okay.
Hey.

38:22.425 --> 38:24.051
You're my
best friend, Brian.

38:24.427 --> 38:25.970
You mean more
to me than...

38:26.304 --> 38:27.596
Well, my own family.

38:28.223 --> 38:30.224
I didn't wanna do
anything to blow that.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.393
Besides, I didn't think
I was gonna make
Squad anyway.

38:35.605 --> 38:37.523
Then I'll tell you what
I would've told you

38:37.607 --> 38:39.233
if you would've
told me sooner.

38:42.362 --> 38:44.113
Of course you belong
on Squad, man.

38:44.447 --> 38:46.573
Congratulations. Seriously.

38:53.039 --> 38:55.582
And now I get to
drive the truck!

38:58.586 --> 39:00.713
Whoa! Whoa, hey!
Hold it down!

39:00.797 --> 39:04.508
Hold, hold it down, please!
Shut up! Hey!

39:04.592 --> 39:06.885
This instant
chilling system is the
go-anywhere answer for

39:06.970 --> 39:09.179
Champagne lovers around
the world.

39:09.264 --> 39:12.099
There's a new pop star in town
from Chateau Saint Laurent,

39:12.183 --> 39:15.019
the premiere Champagne
house in the world.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.065
They beat us
to the market.

39:21.901 --> 39:24.028
That's my dad's idea.

39:25.155 --> 39:28.282
Oh, my God!
This has to be a joke!

39:30.910 --> 39:34.955
Hey, hey, kid, listen.

39:35.248 --> 39:37.207
He was working on that
for years.

39:39.002 --> 39:41.336
I've put everything that
I have into this.

39:41.796 --> 39:44.173
And we're gonna work
just as hard on the next one.

39:45.842 --> 39:47.426
I see something in you.

39:47.844 --> 39:51.847
You got passion,
you got grit,
you got desire.

39:52.474 --> 39:55.309
We just need to find
an idea that nobody's
gonna copy.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.978
And I know
we're gonna find one.

39:58.521 --> 40:02.524
And when we do,
you're gonna knock it
out of the park, okay?

40:09.240 --> 40:10.824
Oh! You're a good kid.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.912
Otis, can you get rid
of these pickles?

40:15.038 --> 40:16.330
Sure. What's up?

40:16.915 --> 40:18.999
The smell's making
me wanna vomit.

40:24.297 --> 40:27.007
Hey, uh, I gotta
run out for a minute.

40:28.301 --> 40:29.343
You okay?

40:36.184 --> 40:37.392
You have a lot of energy.

40:37.477 --> 40:38.602
Yeah.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.814
I've been...
A volcano.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.780
Please, please, please,
please, please.

40:57.789 --> 40:58.789
Matt!

41:08.800 --> 41:09.800
Matt?

41:15.723 --> 41:16.765
Matt?

41:21.980 --> 41:23.772
Matt, are you home?
