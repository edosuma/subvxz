WEBVTT

00:09.320 --> 00:14.400
Innocence is for those who are
free of guilt, of sin.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.920
Can someone really claim to be innocent

00:18.000 --> 00:21.280
if they are complicit and keep quiet
about someone else's schemes?

00:21.360 --> 00:24.280
They arrested an innocent woman!
They arrested her!

00:24.360 --> 00:27.400
Calm down!
Stay calm or this will ruin our lives.

00:27.480 --> 00:28.560
What life, Lidia?

00:29.080 --> 00:30.600
-What life?
-Marga!

00:30.680 --> 00:35.160
Carolina was no angel.
That's enough! She was no angel.

00:35.960 --> 00:41.520
She threatened me. She suspected me.
Don't you see? It was either her or us.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.680
Please.

00:42.760 --> 00:47.280
You see? I'm sick of whispering
all the time and feeling sick from fear.

00:47.360 --> 00:49.680
Marga, it was an accident.

00:50.640 --> 00:53.320
We've sent an innocent woman to prison.

00:54.040 --> 00:55.840
Was there really no other solution?

01:02.680 --> 01:04.800
-I'm turning myself in.
-What? No, no.

01:04.880 --> 01:06.960
You're not doing that, Marga.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.960
Stop! If you go down, we all go down.

01:10.040 --> 01:13.360
I may sound selfish, but I have
no intention of going to prison.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.600
I don't think you do, either.

01:31.560 --> 01:32.800
Hello?

01:33.920 --> 01:35.040
Yes, speaking.

01:37.480 --> 01:38.480
What?

01:40.200 --> 01:43.240
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

02:39.480 --> 02:42.160
I've administered a sedative
so he can rest.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.320
We can't allow his heart rate
to get that high again.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.760
He can't have any more convulsions.
His heart can't take it.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.400
Is there anything we can do?

02:53.520 --> 02:54.520
Pray.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.160
Nurse! Miguel Pascual?

03:00.240 --> 03:02.720
Yes, this way. The rest of you, wait here.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.160
Sara!

03:20.880 --> 03:23.320
You're stupid and thoughtless.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.680
Why is he doing this to me?

03:24.760 --> 03:26.040
CHAPTER 16: INNOCENCE

03:26.120 --> 03:28.040
He's sedated.
That's why he looks like that.

03:28.880 --> 03:32.680
We already went through all this,
and we had overcome this shit.

03:34.240 --> 03:36.960
Without realizing it,
we've been excluding him.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.320
What do you mean?
I've never left him out.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.720
But he felt like you were.

03:46.080 --> 03:48.520
Before this happened, we argued at home.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.280
He said we were hiding things from him...

03:56.520 --> 03:58.240
and seeing each other alone.

03:59.320 --> 04:02.360
I'm sorry, Carlota. This is all my fault.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.360
If you hadn't been so worried about me...

04:06.760 --> 04:08.240
I came between you.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.560
No, Sara, please, don't say that.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.280
You've always been with us.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.480
You've always helped me.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.320
You helped with Mario.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.360
Come here, please.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.960
What would I do without you both?

04:36.040 --> 04:37.000
Lidia.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.840
You understand why I did it, right?

04:42.240 --> 04:43.560
I did this...

04:46.440 --> 04:49.880
Carolina was suspicious of me,
and suddenly it was very clear.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.360
I saw that it was...

04:52.680 --> 04:54.800
It was the chance to save us.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.240
Do you understand?

04:59.960 --> 05:02.800
I don't want anything bad
to happen to any of you,

05:04.280 --> 05:06.120
but if Marga confesses, it's over.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.600
She won't do it.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.440
But it's normal
that she's upset by all this.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.280
I'll talk to her again tomorrow
and try to calm her down.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.880
How is he?

05:20.960 --> 05:22.160
It's under control.

05:22.920 --> 05:26.520
He's sedated,
and tomorrow we'll know more.

05:27.720 --> 05:28.720
And Carlota?

05:29.760 --> 05:31.320
She's going to sleep here.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.160
She asked me to bring clothes.

05:33.920 --> 05:36.640
Girls, you should go and rest.
I'll see you tomorrow.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.640
How are you?

05:41.160 --> 05:43.000
Better, thank you.

05:43.920 --> 05:44.760
Come on.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.360
When we found him,
he'd been in the water for weeks.

05:59.640 --> 06:02.280
His lungs were bloated,
and he was covered in sores.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.480
-I didn't do anything to him.
-Yeah.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.680
The odd thing is
Mario didn't die from that.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.280
Someone hit him on the head,
hit him with rage.

06:11.360 --> 06:14.280
It was a blow from someone
who hated him deeply.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.840
I loved him, Inspector.

06:16.920 --> 06:21.040
The body was wrapped in tablecloth
from the Telephone Company.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.040
We deduced
the crime was committed there.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.400
We also have a witness

06:25.480 --> 06:28.720
who says he saw a woman
getting rid of Mario's car that night.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.400
That's impossible. I can't drive.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.520
This is the witness's signed statement.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.360
No, this is a mistake.

06:40.520 --> 06:43.120
Don't you realize
that Ángeles is behind all this?

06:43.200 --> 06:45.120
He says that the woman was dark-haired.

06:45.200 --> 06:48.160
That is a description of you,
not of Ángeles.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.440
I didn't hurt Mario.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.400
I was in love with him.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.960
That woman is telling the truth.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.240
Now what do we say?

07:32.640 --> 07:34.680
Let me talk to the witness again.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.200
Okay.

07:47.240 --> 07:48.400
Elisa!

07:54.800 --> 07:56.280
Ubalda, where's my sister?

08:01.160 --> 08:02.880
Carlos, my dear.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.920
Why don't you sit and have breakfast
instead of shouting like that?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.240
Do you think I'm an idiot?

08:08.760 --> 08:11.000
I know you are up to something
with the Uribes.

08:11.720 --> 08:12.720
Is that so?

08:15.080 --> 08:18.240
Elisa, you're not going to ruin our lives.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.520
Watch your step.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.600
Good morning. Do you remember me?

08:30.480 --> 08:32.480
I'd like to speak to you.

08:32.559 --> 08:33.919
Did I come at a bad time?

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
No, don't worry, we've finished.
What do you want?

08:37.080 --> 08:38.320
I've told you all I know.

08:38.400 --> 08:41.200
Yes, but I'd like to go over
a few details.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.320
If you don't mind...

08:48.400 --> 08:50.960
Well, what can I do for you?

08:51.040 --> 08:55.680
That girl you identified, Carolina Moreno,
you remember her?

08:55.760 --> 08:57.920
She insists she was never there.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.120
That girl's lying.

09:01.360 --> 09:03.480
We've accused her of killing a man.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.000
You know the punishment for that?

09:08.960 --> 09:10.680
She could spend her life in prison,

09:10.760 --> 09:13.480
or the judge
could send her to the garrote.

09:14.200 --> 09:17.840
So I'd just like to be sure that
you didn't identify the wrong person.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.240
It's a very serious matter.

09:19.680 --> 09:23.760
Father, remember Don Julián will be coming
so we can pay for the land.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.440
Excuse me, I didn't know you were busy.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.640
Your daughter.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.000
Hello, I'm Inspector Cuevas.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.440
Amparo García, at your service.

09:34.440 --> 09:35.760
Is anything wrong?

09:35.840 --> 09:37.440
Amparo, go to your room.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.440
Father, what's happened?

09:43.360 --> 09:44.760
Were you going to buy land?

09:44.840 --> 09:46.360
-Yes.
-No.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.080
Which one is it?

09:50.120 --> 09:53.120
Earlier, you were closing a deal
with a man.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.400
The keys he gave you,
were they for a house?

09:55.480 --> 09:56.760
For a small farm.

09:58.280 --> 09:59.320
Well!

10:00.200 --> 10:01.920
A farm, some land.

10:04.440 --> 10:06.000
A very nice radio, Basilio.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.360
Where did you get all this money?

10:09.240 --> 10:12.320
-An inheritance.
-Do you have a document to prove it?

10:13.400 --> 10:15.080
No, I don't.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.400
Because it doesn't exist.

10:18.480 --> 10:22.000
Inspector, I don't understand any of this,
but I'm worried.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.240
I'd be worried, too.

10:25.120 --> 10:28.840
I fear your father has made a deal
with someone to hide a crime.

10:28.920 --> 10:29.760
What?

10:29.840 --> 10:34.040
They offer you money
and an innocent woman rots in prison.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.360
Isn't that so?

10:37.640 --> 10:39.080
Father!

10:39.960 --> 10:41.440
Father, look at me!

10:42.560 --> 10:45.440
Father, tell me that
what he's saying isn't true.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.120
I'm willing to help you,

10:49.040 --> 10:51.720
provided you tell me
who offered you money.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.520
Mar-- Marga!

11:10.720 --> 11:13.720
Mr. Uribe has organized
a wake at the company.

11:14.360 --> 11:17.120
If we aren't there, it'll look suspicious.
Come on.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.560
Leave me alone, please!

11:19.200 --> 11:20.840
I mean it, please.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.720
Listen, I know this is all insane,

11:23.480 --> 11:25.000
but we can't give up now.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.840
You have to fight for your dreams,
for you,

11:28.440 --> 11:29.360
for us.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.280
-Come on.
-Lidia, I said no!

11:33.840 --> 11:35.440
I can't stop thinking that

11:35.520 --> 11:38.200
we've ruined that woman's life,
even if she was bad.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.720
She's innocent, Lidia, and you know it!

11:42.760 --> 11:43.880
I'm not going.

11:47.160 --> 11:48.120
Very well.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.000
Listen, you have to promise me one thing.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.880
That you won't do anything crazy.

11:54.640 --> 11:55.680
Promise me.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.120
Leave me alone, please.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.040
Lidia, don't be a pest!

12:22.640 --> 12:24.440
Operator 57?

12:28.360 --> 12:30.160
Operator 57?

12:37.680 --> 12:39.360
Pablo, now isn't the...

12:39.440 --> 12:44.160
I know we haven't spoken in a long time.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.880
It's just that my fiancée has told me...

12:50.320 --> 12:55.280
that she isn't sure she wants to marry me,
and the truth is I need a friendly voice.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.880
You've always given me good advice.

12:59.200 --> 13:02.920
So I thought that maybe
you could give me some now,

13:03.000 --> 13:05.200
because just the thought of losing her...

13:06.440 --> 13:08.320
makes it difficult to breathe.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.240
I'm sorry, Pablo.

13:18.680 --> 13:19.600
Yes?

13:22.400 --> 13:24.120
I can't help you with that.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.680
You deserve better than a stupid girl

13:28.760 --> 13:31.960
who can't see
that she has the most wonderful man.

13:34.520 --> 13:37.080
It's time to look
for another girl who loves you...

13:37.160 --> 13:38.880
No, no, no. Marga...

13:39.680 --> 13:41.320
And a better operator.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.640
Please, listen to me. Don't say that.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.200
Marga.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.160
Put the photograph here, please.

14:18.320 --> 14:19.960
Have you got the flowers?

14:20.280 --> 14:21.560
Thank you.

14:26.640 --> 14:29.400
The clinic is at 15 Buenavista Street.

14:29.480 --> 14:32.240
I can ask my chauffeur to take you there.

14:32.320 --> 14:35.080
You don't trust me to go on my own?

14:35.480 --> 14:39.600
It was just a gesture of goodwill,
but I see you're not used to those.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.400
The appointment is at 5:00.

14:42.120 --> 14:43.480
Be punctual.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Lidia.

14:54.320 --> 14:57.880
-Are you going ahead with all this?
-Don't worry. It's under control.

15:02.080 --> 15:03.960
I wanted to give you this before I left.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.440
Where are you going?

15:10.480 --> 15:12.440
My grandfather taught me to do this.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.720
He helped the doctor
when he came to the village.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.120
Thank you.

15:18.240 --> 15:22.680
You have to press on the wound
so that it stops bleeding.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.960
I'm sorry.
I'm staining the handkerchief.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.600
It must be your favorite.

15:31.320 --> 15:32.680
Can you keep a secret?

15:33.360 --> 15:34.840
I've never liked my name.

15:34.920 --> 15:37.360
If I could, I'd change it right now.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.000
How can you say that?

15:40.080 --> 15:42.480
I think Alba is a beautiful name.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.840
And we're going to call
our first daughter Alba.

15:46.520 --> 15:48.400
You're thinking far ahead!

15:48.480 --> 15:49.800
It's decided.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.400
We were so naive.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.120
We were very young. We knew nothing.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.160
And we were happy.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.960
That's a lot more than we can say now.

16:14.320 --> 16:17.000
If only things had happened differently.

16:17.080 --> 16:19.720
We can make them happen.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.920
I still think
I'll call my first daughter Alba.

16:28.160 --> 16:31.360
Nothing has changed for me. Nothing.

16:32.520 --> 16:33.360
Alba...

16:37.240 --> 16:38.520
I'm leaving.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.920
There's no reason for me to stay here.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.200
What will you do?

16:46.880 --> 16:48.200
I don't know yet.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.120
Promise we'll see each other again.

17:04.720 --> 17:05.840
Francisco...

17:13.680 --> 17:14.880
Thank you.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.120
Alba.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.760
Juan...

17:56.960 --> 17:58.800
I thought you were dead.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.560
I thought I'd never see you again.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.480
It's a long story.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.400
I was in some trouble. I had to disappear.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.160
I waited for you a long time, Juan--

18:09.240 --> 18:11.560
Pedro. I'm Pedro Guzmán now.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.760
I have to go unnoticed.

18:16.240 --> 18:20.320
Although from what I've read,
I'm not the only one with a name change.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.160
My life has changed a lot, too.
Too much.

18:23.240 --> 18:26.600
The newspaper says
you're an exemplary woman.

18:28.080 --> 18:30.080
I couldn't believe it
when I saw your photo.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.320
Why have you come?

18:37.080 --> 18:38.840
I'd like to talk in private.

18:42.720 --> 18:43.920
Let's go.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.000
Carlota.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.080
Carlota.

18:53.160 --> 18:56.640
Miguel. Miguel, my love, I'm here.
Can you hear me?

18:58.280 --> 19:01.400
-Carlota.
-Yes, it's me.

19:04.120 --> 19:05.400
I'm sorry.

19:08.920 --> 19:10.240
Forgive me.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.960
I thought I'd lost you.

19:15.640 --> 19:17.320
I thought I'd lost you.

19:18.280 --> 19:21.560
But I promise you I'll never leave you
all alone again, you hear me?

19:21.640 --> 19:26.280
And I'm staying here with you,
for as long as you need me.

19:27.360 --> 19:28.560
I love you.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.800
And I love you.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.880
Miss Millán!

19:46.200 --> 19:47.320
Miss Millán.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.040
Please!

19:53.120 --> 19:54.600
No!

19:54.680 --> 19:58.800
No, no! Listen, no...

20:01.560 --> 20:03.280
-Leave me alone.
-Sara!

20:03.360 --> 20:06.880
No, wait. Please, wait. We have to talk.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.520
-We have nothing to talk about.
-Yes, we do.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.120
I'm like you.

20:16.880 --> 20:20.000
Let me talk to you.
It'll only take a moment.

20:22.360 --> 20:24.120
Dr. Longoria is your father?

20:25.480 --> 20:28.800
Yes, but he didn't treat you.
That was my brother.

20:28.880 --> 20:32.280
All my life, I've felt
that I'm living in the wrong body,

20:32.840 --> 20:34.800
and I was never afraid to say it,

20:35.560 --> 20:37.400
but my father didn't accept it,

20:37.960 --> 20:42.440
and tried with all his might
to make me the woman he wanted me to be.

20:42.920 --> 20:47.720
That's why I dress like this
and work with them in the sanatorium.

20:47.800 --> 20:50.640
My father forced me to,
as part of my treatment.

20:51.600 --> 20:54.360
He said that only by seeing
the suffering of others

20:55.040 --> 20:57.240
can I avoid being a repeat offender.

20:57.320 --> 20:58.920
A repeat offender?

20:59.600 --> 21:01.080
We are not criminals.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.600
I know.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.320
Paloma, you have to get out of there.

21:06.920 --> 21:09.600
If we don't fight for respect,
no one will.

21:10.760 --> 21:11.760
I will.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.680
I've got it all ready.
I'm going to Berlin.

21:15.760 --> 21:20.760
There's a community there of people
like us who live in total freedom.

21:21.960 --> 21:22.920
Are you sure?

21:23.560 --> 21:26.800
You're not the first patient
I've contacted.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.240
Come with me.

21:37.640 --> 21:40.200
-You were looking for me?
-The witness has confessed.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.720
A woman paid for his silence.
Lidia Aguilar.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.240
Also known as Teresa Calderón,
Esther Rodríguez,

21:45.320 --> 21:47.400
Carmen Valdés and hundreds of other names.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.640
Fraud, theft, murder.

21:49.720 --> 21:53.560
Interesting résumé.
But what's her connection with Mario?

21:53.640 --> 21:55.040
I still have to work that out.

21:55.120 --> 21:58.080
She's a friend of Ángeles,
and they work together.

21:58.360 --> 22:02.040
It gets better, boss. Look at this.
She knows how to drive.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.760
If she bribed the witness,
she's involved with the crime.

22:06.880 --> 22:11.120
Very well, arrest her.
But we don't want another scandal.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.360
We'll try to be more discreet.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.760
Add some to the coffee.

22:18.240 --> 22:20.400
A bit more. It's been a rough day.

22:21.080 --> 22:22.480
Thank you.

22:24.640 --> 22:27.360
Well, well, just look at you.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.080
You're all dressed up.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.840
Thank you, Marisol.

22:30.920 --> 22:33.640
My mother gave me this suit
for when I got married.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.120
But I think I'll only use it for funerals.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.760
-Did you argue again?
-No, we didn't argue.

22:39.840 --> 22:43.160
I wish we had.
We don't even argue anymore.

22:43.240 --> 22:46.600
-Come on, Pablo. Tell me about it.
-It's nothing. It's...

22:49.680 --> 22:50.920
Marga's having doubts.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.120
She says she isn't good enough,

22:53.200 --> 22:55.200
that I deserve someone better.
Some compliment.

22:55.280 --> 22:56.480
You know what?

22:56.560 --> 22:59.080
Preparing a wedding
is very complicated.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.960
You have to make lots of decisions.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.880
Like, do we get married in this church
or in another?

23:03.960 --> 23:05.840
Do we serve hors d'oeuvres?

23:05.920 --> 23:07.880
Where should Grandma sit?

23:07.960 --> 23:09.760
That's it!

23:09.840 --> 23:12.840
Of course it is, Pablo.
And all those arguments

23:12.920 --> 23:15.160
are a preview
of what your marriage will be like.

23:15.240 --> 23:18.000
-If you're arguing over hors d'oeuvres--
-Grandma.

23:18.080 --> 23:20.120
Grandma, she's the one who can fix this.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.360
-What?
-Thank you so much, Marisol.

23:22.440 --> 23:23.920
You've solved my problem.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.120
-What?
-Thank you.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.280
No, I wasn't talking about that.

23:33.320 --> 23:34.440
Yes, operator.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.120
Hello?

23:38.200 --> 23:39.560
-Grandma!
-Pablo!

23:39.640 --> 23:40.640
Do you hear me?

23:40.720 --> 23:42.520
-Grandma!
-Don't shout so loud.

23:42.600 --> 23:45.200
-I still hear a bit in this ear.
-Sorry.

23:45.280 --> 23:48.120
I'm sorry. I'm just eager to talk to you.

23:48.200 --> 23:51.120
I just got my measurements
for my wedding outfit.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.520
How about that?

23:52.600 --> 23:54.600
You haven't paid for it, have you?

23:56.640 --> 23:58.080
Why do you say that?

23:58.160 --> 23:59.520
No reason...

24:00.240 --> 24:05.240
Well, it seems that Marga
isn't so sure about getting married.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.400
You must have done something.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.800
She wouldn't dump you for no reason.

24:09.880 --> 24:13.000
No, Grandma, that's why I'm calling you.

24:14.200 --> 24:17.280
Look, I don't know why,
but Marga isn't well.

24:17.360 --> 24:18.760
What are you talking about?

24:18.840 --> 24:22.400
No one else can help me
get Marga out of bed.

24:23.520 --> 24:25.400
I'm going to need your help.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.560
How are you?

24:34.320 --> 24:35.960
Not many people have come.

24:37.400 --> 24:38.920
Ángeles, I have to talk to you.

24:40.160 --> 24:42.320
I thought you came to apologize.

24:43.520 --> 24:44.920
I didn't want to hurt you.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.320
Leading a murder investigation isn't easy.

24:49.240 --> 24:50.480
Why are you here?

24:51.000 --> 24:53.840
Lidia Aguilar.
I expected to find her here with you.

25:00.360 --> 25:01.600
What...

25:03.040 --> 25:04.440
What happened?

25:05.920 --> 25:08.840
We think she is involved
in your husband's murder.

25:13.160 --> 25:15.360
My husband's body is lying right here,

25:15.440 --> 25:18.440
and you come here to tell me
that my best friend is involved--

25:18.520 --> 25:21.600
The witness identified her
as the woman who dumped the car.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.760
She also paid him to keep quiet.

25:26.920 --> 25:28.120
That can't be.

25:29.280 --> 25:32.840
No, that can’t be.
Lidia would never do something like that.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.240
You don't really know your friend.

25:35.320 --> 25:37.640
She's not even called Lidia Aguilar.

25:37.720 --> 25:40.640
We investigated her
and she is a dangerous criminal, Ángeles.

25:40.720 --> 25:44.560
-Believe me, I have to arrest her.
-No, no.

25:46.800 --> 25:49.440
At least wait until the wake is over.

25:49.520 --> 25:50.520
Ángeles.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.720
I'll help you.

25:55.800 --> 25:58.080
I will turn her in myself.

25:58.160 --> 26:01.000
I'll ask her to meet me
on the rooftop at 5:00.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.120
I will tell her...

26:04.200 --> 26:08.720
that I'm not feeling well,
that I need to talk.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.560
And then you will be able to arrest her.

26:16.160 --> 26:17.160
All right.

26:18.120 --> 26:19.480
We'll do it that way.

26:32.920 --> 26:35.480
I had to disappear
and now I have to do it again.

26:35.560 --> 26:36.840
Who's looking for you?

26:37.840 --> 26:39.560
It's best if you don't know.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.920
I walked away from that life long ago.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.480
If help you, I have a right to know
what risks I'm taking.

26:46.760 --> 26:48.480
None, I promise you.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.120
I'll spend one night in Madrid.

26:53.360 --> 26:54.600
I don't trust anyone.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.640
I only feel at ease with you.

27:00.120 --> 27:02.960
If I hadn't shown up in the paper,
who would you have gone to?

27:04.640 --> 27:05.840
Who cares?

27:07.320 --> 27:08.920
What matters is you did show up,

27:10.440 --> 27:12.920
and that fate
has brought us back together.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.360
You can stay at the boardinghouse.

27:22.560 --> 27:26.360
It's called Dolores Boardinghouse,
on Blancaro Street. Wait for me there.

27:26.440 --> 27:29.840
Be there around 5:30.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.960
Doña Lola will be at six o'clock mass.

27:32.040 --> 27:35.520
If any of the girls ask who you are,
tell them you're my brother.

27:37.760 --> 27:39.600
I knew that I could count on you.

27:41.240 --> 27:43.800
My room is 205. Stay there.

27:43.880 --> 27:46.360
I'll be there around 9:00.

27:50.080 --> 27:52.560
Thanks, I owe you one.

27:53.160 --> 27:55.080
I hope I won't regret this.

27:58.040 --> 27:59.760
I don't want anyone to see me leave.

28:02.760 --> 28:04.760
Relax, come on.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.600
Sara, he's woken up. He told me that...

28:12.680 --> 28:15.800
It's okay, Carlota. This is Paloma.

28:15.880 --> 28:17.120
What is she doing here?

28:18.080 --> 28:19.920
-Perhaps I should leave.
-No, wait.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.960
Carlota, Paloma is a victim,
just like you and me.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.680
What are you saying?
After all she did to you.

28:26.760 --> 28:29.080
She's forced to work with the doctor.

28:30.480 --> 28:31.520
He's her brother.

28:33.240 --> 28:36.040
And part of her punishment
for feeling like I do

28:36.240 --> 28:38.480
is having to witness
other patients' treatments.

28:38.720 --> 28:40.160
That's horrible!

28:42.200 --> 28:46.040
Carlota, she's told me
she found a place in Berlin

28:46.120 --> 28:50.800
where we can express ourselves freely
and live without feeling marginalized.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.640
Are you going to go?

28:56.480 --> 28:58.040
We could all go together.

28:59.240 --> 29:02.880
But, Sara, what are you saying?
We have to wait for Miguel to get better.

29:02.960 --> 29:04.240
We can't leave him alone.

29:04.800 --> 29:08.240
Besides, that would be running away,

29:09.000 --> 29:11.480
and you taught me
not to act like a victim.

29:12.240 --> 29:13.440
So no, you can't go.

29:14.160 --> 29:17.240
We have made a lot of progress
and we need to continue.

29:28.760 --> 29:30.920
I don't know if I still have the strength.

29:39.480 --> 29:40.480
Sara, look at me.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.880
Let's do it here.

29:45.680 --> 29:50.160
Let's start the first organization
for sexual freedom here in Spain,

29:50.240 --> 29:51.600
just like in Berlin.

29:52.280 --> 29:55.880
That way we'll all be organized
and we can fight together.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.280
More than ever before.

29:58.480 --> 29:59.480
What do you say?

30:09.000 --> 30:11.680
Doña Lola, I told you already,
I am not well.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.880
Doña Lola, really I don't...

30:22.520 --> 30:25.880
I've been told
you haven't had anything to eat all day.

30:26.560 --> 30:27.880
Grandma, my God!

30:29.800 --> 30:31.760
Inmaculada, my dear!

30:34.560 --> 30:37.480
-What are you doing here?
-What do you think?

30:38.120 --> 30:43.080
I wanted to see my granddaughter,
so I took the bus. Is that so strange?

30:45.160 --> 30:46.360
Grandma, I...

30:50.400 --> 30:54.120
I am a horrible person. Horrible.

31:05.320 --> 31:07.440
So you've canceled the wedding?

31:13.400 --> 31:15.680
Pablo deserves a good girl by his side.

31:18.760 --> 31:22.240
Stop all that nonsense, Marga, dear.

31:24.840 --> 31:27.600
I also had a Pablo, you know?

31:27.680 --> 31:29.120
Before your grandfather.

31:31.160 --> 31:32.640
I was crazy about him.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.880
We were going to get married,

31:36.560 --> 31:39.760
but then we argued
and I broke the engagement.

31:42.760 --> 31:45.720
Then I met your grandfather
and we were very happy,

31:46.600 --> 31:50.400
but I always wondered
what my life would've been like

31:51.360 --> 31:53.880
if I'd chosen love without fear.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.160
My girl...

32:00.120 --> 32:03.240
I don't know what's been going on lately,

32:04.080 --> 32:06.920
but I do know that Pablo is a great kid,

32:07.760 --> 32:10.240
and that he loves you
just as much as you love him.

32:13.080 --> 32:17.760
Don't let your fear of taking this step
ruin your life.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.440
I don't think he wants to see me now.

32:26.760 --> 32:29.280
Who do you think prepared
this afternoon snack?

32:30.320 --> 32:31.880
He's waiting outside!

32:32.840 --> 32:34.440
-Really, Grandma?
-Yes!

32:37.600 --> 32:39.840
Go on, then. Go.

32:40.600 --> 32:43.760
Hey, hold on.
Fix yourself up a little.

32:43.840 --> 32:45.040
My robe.

32:57.200 --> 32:58.200
Pablo.

33:09.880 --> 33:13.600
Thank you for the gesture and the snack.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.680
Well, actually, I would like to have

33:17.400 --> 33:21.880
a snack, lunch, dinner, breakfast...

33:23.440 --> 33:25.520
with you every day of my life.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.440
If you want to.

34:00.640 --> 34:03.000
Thanks for everything.
I'll see you tonight.

34:03.080 --> 34:04.160
Be careful.

34:12.159 --> 34:15.480
-Who are you? Let me go! Let me go!
-Shut up and get in!

34:15.560 --> 34:20.480
Help, help! Help, let me go!

34:26.920 --> 34:30.239
What are you doing here?
Where is Lidia?

34:30.320 --> 34:31.920
Lidia's not coming.

34:33.080 --> 34:34.360
What do you mean?

34:37.000 --> 34:38.320
Lidia didn't kill Mario.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.880
What the hell are you talking about?

34:42.639 --> 34:43.880
She didn't do anything.

34:45.719 --> 34:46.800
It was me.

34:46.880 --> 34:50.040
No! You're lying to me.
You're trying to protect your friend!

34:50.120 --> 34:52.840
-I tried to poison him.
-You lie! You are lying!

34:52.920 --> 34:54.880
-He found out.
-You're lying, Ángeles.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.400
-At the party--
-Shut up!

34:59.320 --> 35:00.880
I'm the killer you're after.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.040
Why have you done this to me?

35:05.080 --> 35:07.000
What I feel for you is real.

35:18.360 --> 35:19.520
I love you.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.160
You have an hour to get out of here.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.880
I'm going to report you.

36:06.040 --> 36:07.040
Come on!

36:07.920 --> 36:08.960
What is this?

36:10.840 --> 36:12.320
Where are you taking me?

36:12.400 --> 36:15.040
Shut up and keep still!

36:18.000 --> 36:20.360
If you thought I was going to trust you,

36:20.440 --> 36:23.000
you've learned nothing.

36:24.120 --> 36:26.440
-Take her to the operating room.
-What?

36:26.520 --> 36:27.720
-Come on!
-What?

36:27.800 --> 36:30.760
No, no, no, no. Please! No!

36:32.280 --> 36:33.480
Carlos...

36:36.080 --> 36:37.000
I'm leaving.

36:38.640 --> 36:40.080
I'm leaving Madrid.

36:41.680 --> 36:43.760
I quit this stupid competition for Lidia.

36:43.840 --> 36:45.480
I don't believe you.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.480
We are hurting her.

36:50.080 --> 36:52.280
Your mother is pressuring her
not to have the child.

36:52.360 --> 36:55.240
I know perfectly well
what my mother is capable of,

36:55.320 --> 36:57.760
but Lidia will not be manipulated
that easily.

36:59.120 --> 37:03.040
I don't know what she'll end up doing,
but this is the address of the clinic

37:03.120 --> 37:04.800
where she has an appointment
this afternoon.

37:05.720 --> 37:06.920
Why are you telling me?

37:07.000 --> 37:08.960
Because she doesn't want to listen to me.

37:11.440 --> 37:13.400
And you're the only one who can stop it.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.400
Carlos...

37:16.520 --> 37:18.000
Lidia loves you.

37:19.160 --> 37:20.880
You must hate me.

37:22.880 --> 37:24.920
I would love to, but I can't.

37:25.520 --> 37:27.200
All that I am, I owe to you.

37:35.720 --> 37:37.200
Hurry before it's too late.

37:45.160 --> 37:46.240
Please!

37:46.320 --> 37:50.040
-Shut up!
-No, please, please! No!

37:50.120 --> 37:51.120
Shut up!

37:54.160 --> 37:57.280
No! No! Please! No!

37:57.360 --> 38:02.400
-Tie her down!
-No! No, please, no!

38:05.920 --> 38:09.080
Help, help! Please, don't!

38:09.840 --> 38:10.840
Hold still!

38:15.680 --> 38:18.520
Help! Help!

38:28.800 --> 38:29.800
Please, no!

38:36.040 --> 38:37.200
Help!

38:37.280 --> 38:39.080
Release her! Get the hell out of here!

38:46.680 --> 38:48.080
Lidia, are you okay?

38:50.760 --> 38:52.600
Hold on to me.

38:57.080 --> 38:59.280
I love you. I love you.

38:59.360 --> 39:01.840
I will not allow anyone
to take me for a fool.

39:01.920 --> 39:03.240
You are a monster!

39:03.320 --> 39:06.400
I'm trying to protect you.
Don't let her get out of here.

39:06.480 --> 39:07.480
Lidia, run, run!

39:09.560 --> 39:12.120
Stay with him. I'll get the girl.

39:12.200 --> 39:14.800
Lidia! Lidia, run!

39:16.080 --> 39:19.720
When a purely innocent being
is inside you,

39:20.400 --> 39:23.920
there are lots of reasons
to keep fighting until the end.

39:25.520 --> 39:28.960
Even if that means risking your own life
or facing everyone,

39:29.040 --> 39:31.840
even if you don't know
whether you'll succeed.

39:36.920 --> 39:39.640
Innocence is synonymous with happiness.

39:40.520 --> 39:43.000
That is why it's important to enjoy it,

39:43.520 --> 39:46.240
because you never know
how long it will last.

39:55.680 --> 39:57.680
There will always be someone
to show you

39:57.760 --> 40:00.040
that nothing is entirely in your hands...

40:07.240 --> 40:10.040
...and that life only gives you
new opportunities...

40:19.920 --> 40:21.040
...sometimes.

40:39.160 --> 40:40.120
Stop!

40:50.320 --> 40:52.760
-Come here. I won't hurt you.
-No.

40:52.840 --> 40:54.280
Hold still. Give me your hand.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.800
Lidia! Lidia!

41:03.080 --> 41:03.960
Lidia.

41:05.240 --> 41:06.880
Life or death,

41:08.040 --> 41:10.240
hope or despair.

41:12.600 --> 41:16.680
On the brink of death, I swore
if I lost my child, I'd get revenge.
