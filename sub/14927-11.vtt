WEBVTT

00:06.074 --> 00:09.177
OH, WHAT YOU GOT THERE, SEAN,
SOME SORT OF ROBOT?

00:09.210 --> 00:11.112
YEAH, DAD. IT'S JIMMY'S
SCIENCE PROJECT.

00:11.145 --> 00:14.248
WOW. IT CAN
GO DOWN STAIRS?

00:17.385 --> 00:19.187
NOPE.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.622
HEY, JIMMY'S GONNA BE
UPSET IF YOU BREAK THAT.

00:21.655 --> 00:24.492
HE'S ALREADY UPSET.
HE GOT AN "F" ON IT.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.361
AND HE WAS THE ONE
I HAD HOPES FOR.

00:27.395 --> 00:28.496
WHAT?

00:28.529 --> 00:30.498
UH, NOTHING.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.101
LOOK, HENRY,
A BOTTLE CAP.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.203
COOL. WHERE?

00:39.340 --> 00:40.674
WHO LIKES LOBSTER?

00:40.708 --> 00:42.210
I LOVE LOBSTER.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.344
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

00:43.377 --> 00:44.745
FRIEND'S GOT A VAN.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.180
A VAN FULL OF LOBSTER?

00:46.214 --> 00:47.648
VAN'S FULL
OF SOMETHING ELSE.

00:47.681 --> 00:50.084
THE SMELL
OF THE LOBSTERS

00:50.118 --> 00:52.520
THROWS OFF THE DOGS.

00:53.354 --> 00:54.655
CAN I TRY THAT?

00:54.688 --> 00:56.190
YEAH, SURE, GO AHEAD.

00:56.224 --> 00:59.093
THIS THING'S CAUSED ME
NOTHING BUT GRIEF.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.697
YEAH, I SEE
WHAT YOU MEAN.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.499
UH...

01:11.272 --> 01:13.274
HOW'S IT GOING?

01:26.920 --> 01:27.821
NO, WALT.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.423
OH, COME ON.
NO.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.691
LOBSTERS ARE DELICIOUS.

01:30.724 --> 01:33.594
THEY'RE ALIVE. I DON'T
LIKE KILLING MY FOOD.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.663
LOBSTERS AREN'T ANIMALS.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.665
THEY'RE LIKE BIG BUGS.

01:38.766 --> 01:42.136
OH, MY GOD. ARE YOU SERIOUS?

01:42.170 --> 01:43.737
YES, OF COURSE.

01:43.771 --> 01:48.142
OK, OK, BYE. YES!
YES, YES, YES, YES!

01:48.176 --> 01:48.909
WHAT, WHAT, WHAT?

01:48.942 --> 01:51.712
KELLI BROKE HER LEG.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.614
OH, MY GOD!
IS SHE OK?

01:53.647 --> 01:56.717
NO. THE BONE IS STICKING OUT.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.386
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
A FRIEND OF YOURS.

01:58.419 --> 02:01.822
YEAH, SHE'S GREAT, BUT, SEE,
KELLI'S ON THE DANCE SQUAD,

02:01.855 --> 02:05.793
AND I'M THE ALTERNATE,
SO IF SHE CAN'T DANCE, I'M IN.

02:05.826 --> 02:08.629
DO YOU KNOW HOW
UNATTRACTIVE YOU SOUND?

02:08.662 --> 02:11.665
I KNOW, I'M SORRY, BUT YOU
KNOW WHAT? HER LEG WILL HEAL.

02:11.699 --> 02:14.868
PLUS, SHE'S GOT BIG BOOBS.
SHE'LL BE FINE.

02:15.869 --> 02:19.373
YEAH, WELL, I'M SURE YOU'LL
MAKE A GREAT CHEERLEADER.

02:19.407 --> 02:24.745
WE'RE NOT CHEERLEADERS.
WE'RE THE DANCE SQUAD.
WE DANCE.

02:24.778 --> 02:25.513
WHERE?

02:25.546 --> 02:26.747
AT BASKETBALL GAMES.

02:26.780 --> 02:27.648
LIKE CHEERLEADERS.

02:27.681 --> 02:30.384
NO. WE SUPPORT THE TEAM

02:30.418 --> 02:32.720
BY INSPIRING THE CROWD
WITH DANCE.

02:32.753 --> 02:35.223
OH.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.457
LIKE CHEERLEADERS.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.292
NO!

02:42.796 --> 02:44.698
WHAT HAPPENED
TO JIMMY'S ROBOT?

02:44.732 --> 02:47.568
IT FOUGHT A JEEP,
AND THE JEEP WON.

02:48.236 --> 02:50.771
I DON'T CARE. THAT THING
GOT ME AN "F."

02:50.804 --> 02:53.941
COME ON, JIMMY. COME ON, MAN,
GRADES AREN'T EVERYTHING.

02:53.974 --> 02:58.746
YEAH, REAL EASY FOR
YOU TO SAY. YOU GOT
A WHOLE BUNCH OF Fs.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.452
SO, JIMMY GOT AN "F."

03:04.485 --> 03:05.853
HE DIDN'T GET IT
ALL BY HIMSELF.

03:05.886 --> 03:08.956
AH, AH, AH.
DON'T START WITH ME.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.157
I'M NOT STARTING ANYTHING.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.826
IF YOU HADN'T HAVE INTERFERED,
EVERYTHING WOULD'VE BEEN FINE.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.562
OH, HO HO. NOT TRUE.

03:14.595 --> 03:15.763
WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

03:15.796 --> 03:19.733
LOOK, I'M A DAD. I LIKE TO HELP
MY KIDS WITH THEIR HOMEWORK.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.269
THEY GET A LOT
OF HOMEWORK.

03:21.302 --> 03:24.472
TELL ME ABOUT IT.
I'M IN THIRD GRADE.

03:24.505 --> 03:27.408
THE HOMEWORK'S
KILLING ME.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.014
UHHH.

03:34.047 --> 03:38.286
A LITTLE HELP HERE. HELLO?

03:39.853 --> 03:45.893
IF THE UPS GUY DIDN'T COME,
I WOULD STILL BE LAYING THERE.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.764
WHAT DOES AN 8-YEAR-OLD NEED
TO LEARN THAT'S SO HEAVY?

03:50.798 --> 03:52.566
A LOT OF STUFF, BUT MOST
OF IT'S PRETTY EASY--

03:52.600 --> 03:54.935
MULTIPLICATION, SPELLING--
STUFF I KNOW, RIGHT?

03:54.968 --> 03:58.872
BUT WITH JIMMY'S HOMEWORK,
I FEEL SO USELESS.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.708
OH, YEAH, TOTALLY.
I REMEMBER THIS.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.876
THIS IS GREAT.
SEE THE BRACKETS HERE?

04:02.910 --> 04:05.579
SEE, THE--SOME HAVE TO GO
FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER.

04:05.613 --> 04:08.649
THEY, LIKE, UM...
SOMETHING.

04:08.682 --> 04:12.853
UM...I REMEM--UH...

04:12.886 --> 04:15.656
DOESN'T IT
CANCEL IT OUT?

04:15.689 --> 04:19.059
OK, THE BATTLE OF HASTINGS.
I KNOW THIS ONE.

04:19.092 --> 04:23.497
IT WAS LIKE 10 AND 6
OR SOMETHING YEAR,

04:23.531 --> 04:26.334
AND THERE WERE LIKE FRENCH GUYS
AND ENGLISH GUYS

04:26.367 --> 04:27.535
AND GERMAN GUYS,
AND THEY WERE, LIKE,

04:27.568 --> 04:28.802
JUST BEATING THE HELL
OUT OF EACH OTHER,

04:28.836 --> 04:31.672
LIKE, WITH ANYTHING
THEY COULD FIND.

04:31.705 --> 04:32.840
IT WAS MUDDY.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.775
MITOSIS.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.977
MEIOSIS.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.914
MITOSIS.

04:40.948 --> 04:41.949
MEIOSIS.

04:41.982 --> 04:44.918
GOD, THERE WAS THIS ONE GUY,
AND HE WAS A BAD ASS,

04:44.952 --> 04:47.521
AND I CAN'T REMEMBER--
I WROTE A PAPER.

04:47.555 --> 04:49.657
NO, WAIT, THAT WAS
ANOTHER GUY.

04:49.690 --> 04:50.991
MEIOSIS.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.827
MITOSIS.

04:53.861 --> 04:54.862
MEIOSIS?

04:54.895 --> 04:56.063
OSMOSIS.

04:56.096 --> 04:57.398
OSMOSIS.

04:57.431 --> 04:58.966
OSMOSIS.

04:58.999 --> 05:02.770
I THOUGHT KIDS TODAY
DO ALL THEIR WORK ON
THE E-MAIL.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.873
WHAT?

05:05.906 --> 05:08.809
THE E WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, THE E

05:08.842 --> 05:10.744
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT. THE...

05:10.778 --> 05:15.583
THE E-MAIL.
IT'S JUST LIKE MAIL.
IT'S ELECTRONIC MAIL. HELLO.

05:15.616 --> 05:18.686
YOU KNOW, IF I SAY
SOMETHING WRONG,

05:18.719 --> 05:20.888
YOU COULD JUST
CORRECT ME NICELY.

05:20.921 --> 05:24.958
I'M GOING TO GO COOK DINNER
NOW ON THE E-MAIL.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.694
SO WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE DAMN ROBOT?

05:26.727 --> 05:29.363
SO LAST WEEK, JIMMY
GETS AN ASSIGNMENT FROM
HIS SCIENCE TEACHER,

05:29.397 --> 05:31.932
AND IT WAS SOMETHING I FELT LIKE
I COULD HELP HIM WITH.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.435
UH, WHAT'S THIS ROBOT
SUPPOSED TO DO?

05:34.468 --> 05:37.638
IT'S GOT TO CLIMB UP A RAMP
AND GRAB A LITTLE FLAG.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.408
AH, RAMP-CLIMBING FLAG GRABBER.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.274
YEAH.

05:41.308 --> 05:45.012
OK, SO WHERE ARE WE
GONNA PUT THE SERVO?

05:45.045 --> 05:45.846
SEAN...

05:45.879 --> 05:46.847
YEAH, BABY?

05:46.880 --> 05:47.548
HI.
HI.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.483
NO, I MEAN...
HI.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.985
HI. DO YOU HAVE
A TOGGLE SWITCH?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.086
I DON'T KNOW.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.888
AREN'T YOU TIRED?

05:54.922 --> 05:55.889
NOPE.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.992
I'M VERY, VERY,
VERY, VERY TIRED.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.894
GREAT. YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY GO TO BED.

06:00.928 --> 06:03.731
HERE'S
THE TOGGLE SWITCH.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.933
YOU MUST REALLY
LIKE ROBOTS.

06:05.966 --> 06:09.002
Claudia:
HE LIKES ROBOTS MORE THAN
HE LIKES HIS OWN WIFE!

06:09.036 --> 06:12.072
CAN'T I LIKE 'EM BOTH,
WOMAN?!

06:13.674 --> 06:16.444
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

06:16.477 --> 06:19.813
I AM STRETCHING TO PREPARE
FOR DANCE SQUAD,

06:19.847 --> 06:21.181
AND YOU ARE ANNOYING ME.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.517
I THOUGHT YOU GOT CUT
FROM CHEERLEADER.

06:23.551 --> 06:27.187
OK, IT'S NOT CHEERLEADER.
IT'S DANCE SQUAD.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.890
AND I DIDN'T GET CUT.
SHE MADE ME AN ALTERNATE

06:29.923 --> 06:32.059
BECAUSE OF ONE TINY,
LITTLE MISTAKE.

06:32.092 --> 06:36.697
Britney Spears:
* I'M SENT FROM ABOVE

06:36.730 --> 06:39.433
* I'M NOT THAT INNOCENT

06:39.467 --> 06:42.035
OH, THAT'S IT.
WITH SPIRIT, LILY.

06:42.069 --> 06:46.073
* I PLAYED WITH YOUR HEART,
GOT LOST IN THE GAME *

06:46.106 --> 06:47.207
* OH, BABY

06:47.240 --> 06:52.746
* OOPS, YOU THINK I'M LOVE,
THAT I'M SENT FROM ABOVE *

06:52.780 --> 06:56.684
JEEZ, DID YOU
FALL ON YOUR HEAD
OR ON YOUR BUTT?

06:57.785 --> 06:58.852
YEAH, SURE, LAUGH.

06:58.886 --> 07:02.556
THE ONLY ONE WHO GAVE ME
ANY SYMPATHY WAS UNCLE EDDIE.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.528
AREN'T YOU GONNA ASK ME
WHAT'S WRONG?

07:07.561 --> 07:09.997
I WASN'T PLANNING TO.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.770
WHAT'S WRONG?

07:16.804 --> 07:20.641
I AM AN ALTERNATE!
AN ALTERNATE!

07:20.674 --> 07:22.943
ALL RIGHT, LILY!

07:22.976 --> 07:26.680
IT'S NOT ALL RIGHT.
ALTERNATES SUCK.

07:26.714 --> 07:29.016
YOU DIDN'T
MAKE CHEERLEADER.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.084
IT'S DANCE SQUAD.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.187
MISS SPINOZA IS SO UNFAIR.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.989
CAROL SPINOZA?

07:36.023 --> 07:39.126
SHE REALLY HAPPY
ALL THE TIME,
KIND OF DESPERATE?

07:39.159 --> 07:42.229
YEAH, THAT'S HER. SO WHAT?
SO I FELL OFF THE STAGE.

07:42.262 --> 07:45.799
THEY DON'T EVEN DANCE
ON A STAGE. THEY DANCE
ON A BASKETBALL COURT.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.536
YOU CAN'T FALL OFF
A BASKETBALL COURT.

07:48.569 --> 07:51.104
DON'T GIVE UP
SO QUICKLY.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.005
WHY NOT?

07:52.039 --> 07:56.076
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

07:56.109 --> 07:58.746
LIKE HE KNEW WHAT
WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

07:58.779 --> 08:01.682
YEAH, RIGHT, LIKE HE KNEW KELLI
WAS GONNA BREAK HER LEG.

08:01.715 --> 08:05.686
WELL, UNCLE EDDIE DOES KNOW
A LOT OF WEIRD STUFF.

08:05.719 --> 08:08.088
YEAH, BUT HE COULDN'T HAVE
KNOWN THAT THIS WAS--

08:08.121 --> 08:13.160
YEAH, RIGHT.
LIKE HE BROKE KE--

08:14.194 --> 08:16.163
OH, MAN.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.166
IF YOU HELPED JIMMY
MAKE THE ROBOT,

08:19.199 --> 08:21.034
THEN WHY DID HE
GET AN "F"?

08:21.068 --> 08:22.169
'CAUSE OF CLAUDIA.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.136
HEY, NO WAY.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.938
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRONG,
BUT YOU WERE WRONGER.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.840
WHOA, THERE'S NO SUCH WORD
AS "WRONGER."

08:26.874 --> 08:29.643
OH, YES, THERE IS.
IT'S RESERVED FOR
SPECIAL OCCASIONS

08:29.677 --> 08:31.111
WHERE SOMEONE
IS INCREDIBLY WRONG.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.113
OK, I MIGHT'VE GOTTEN
A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY,

08:33.146 --> 08:35.215
BUT ME AND JIMBO
WERE HAVING A GREAT TIME.

08:35.248 --> 08:39.853
FIRST, WE JUST GOT TO
SOLDER THIS TO THE FRAME.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.255
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:42.289 --> 08:44.257
I'M STICKING THE WHEELS
TOGETHER.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.926
YOU DON'T STICK
THE WHEELS TOGETHER.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.828
YOU HAVE TO INSTALL
THE AXLE FIRST.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.563
YOU'RE DOING ALL THE WORK.

08:49.597 --> 08:52.199
OK, HOLD ON.
YOU CAN DO SOMETHING.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.934
YOU CAN--I GOT IT.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.036
YOU CAN GIVE THE ROBOT
A NAME.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.205
OK. FIREBOT.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.674
FIREBOT. ALL RIGHT,
FIREBOT. COOL.

09:00.708 --> 09:04.011
YOU SURE THAT'S NOT
A LITTLE CORNY?

09:04.044 --> 09:04.678
DAD.

09:04.712 --> 09:07.214
OK, OK, OK,
FIREBOT IT IS...

09:07.247 --> 09:08.849
FOR THE TIME BEING.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.184
SEAN, YOU'RE GONNA BE
LATE FOR WORK.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.688
TAKING A SICK DAY.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.334
WHAT?

09:30.003 --> 09:32.806
HEY, ROBOTS ARE COMPLICATED.
TAKES A LOT OF WORK.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.007
YOU WERE TOTALLY OBSESSED.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.142
NO, I WASN'T.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.910
YEAH, YOU WERE.

09:37.110 --> 09:40.748
HEY, DAD, I THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE--

09:40.781 --> 09:42.582
DAD?

09:44.284 --> 09:46.253
IT WORKS.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.155
IT WORKS!

09:49.222 --> 09:53.193
IT REALLY WORKS.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.696
I'M A GENIUS.

09:55.729 --> 09:59.332
SO I MAY HAVE BLOWN
A FUSE OR TWO.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.002
I GOT BUTTER AND BIBS.

10:02.035 --> 10:05.172
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, HENRY.
GRAB THAT STUFF.

10:05.205 --> 10:08.842
THIS IS
GONNA BE FUN.

10:08.876 --> 10:09.810
WHAT'S THAT?

10:09.843 --> 10:13.080
THAT'S THE ROBOT YOU DROVE
OUT INTO THE STREET.

10:13.113 --> 10:16.283
IT WASN'T BUILT VERY WELL,
WAS IT?

10:17.885 --> 10:19.653
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:19.687 --> 10:20.620
THE WATER'S BOILING,

10:20.654 --> 10:23.056
SO IT'S TIME TO THROW
THE LOBSTERS IN THE POT.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.759
TOM AND TYRONE?

10:26.193 --> 10:27.795
HENRY, COME ON.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.262
YOU EAT PORK CHOPS, RIGHT?

10:29.296 --> 10:33.166
THOSE COME FROM
LITTLE PIGGIES.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.936
MOM! MOMMY!

10:35.969 --> 10:40.173
DON'T THEY TEACH THESE KIDS
ANYTHING? HENRY.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.875
AHEM.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.610
HEY, UNCLE EDDIE.

10:43.643 --> 10:48.348
DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW I WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT
NOT MAKING THE DANCE SQUAD?

10:48.381 --> 10:49.316
UH-HUH.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.318
GUESS WHAT. I MADE IT.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.820
GOOD.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.923
DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU?

10:55.956 --> 10:58.792
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
IT DOESN'T.

10:58.826 --> 10:59.893
IT DOESN'T.

10:59.927 --> 11:04.131
NO. I HAD A FEELING THINGS
WERE GONNA WORK OUT FOR YOU.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.966
YOU DID

11:05.999 --> 11:11.204
I DON'T KNOW.
CALL IT A STRONG HUNCH.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.177
OH, GOD.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.545
ADMIT IT, YOU WENT
TOTALLY OVERBOARD.

11:18.578 --> 11:23.817
IF YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
STUCK YOUR NOSE IN IT,
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN AN "A".

11:23.851 --> 11:25.252
YOU?

11:25.285 --> 11:26.453
WE.

11:26.486 --> 11:27.187
WE?

11:27.220 --> 11:29.489
OK, JIMMY.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.992
YOU SCREWED IT ALL UP.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.366
IS THAT JIMMY'S ROBOT?

11:39.399 --> 11:41.301
YEAH. CHECK THIS OUT.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.302
OH.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.738
I'M GONNA GET SOME NEW
SHOCK ABSORBERS TOMORROW,

11:44.772 --> 11:47.374
GONNA GET A SEARCHLIGHT
ON IT, THEN I HAVE TO GET
A BIGGER POWER SUPPLY,

11:47.407 --> 11:49.376
OR ELSE THE WHOLE THING
MIGHT OVERHEAT.

11:49.409 --> 11:52.312
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.280
THANK YOU.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.481
NO, I MEAN IT'S NOT
BELIEVABLE.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.817
A 12-YEAR-OLD NEVER
COULD'VE MADE THIS.
THEY'LL NAIL YOU.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.052
OH, GOD, DO YOU THINK
IT'S TOO GOOD?

11:59.086 --> 12:01.354
ABSOLUTELY. WHEN I HELP HENRY
WITH HIS HOMEWORK,

12:01.388 --> 12:03.323
I ALWAYS MAKE SURE I GET
A COUPLE THINGS WRONG.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.192
YOU GOTTA MAKE IT
A LITTLE OFF.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.159
REALLY?

12:06.193 --> 12:08.328
HAH HAH HAH.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.964
REMEMBER THIS?

12:10.998 --> 12:13.000
"I LIKE SHARKS.
SHARKS HAVE FINS.

12:13.033 --> 12:16.236
SOME SHARKS ARE BLUE.
I LIKE SHARKS."

12:16.269 --> 12:18.371
YOU WROTE "I LIKE SHARKS"?

12:18.405 --> 12:19.172
HENRY HAD WRITER'S BLOCK.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.941
THEN WHY'D YOU PUT IT
ON THE FRIDGE?

12:20.974 --> 12:22.442
IT GOT A GOLD STAR.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.944
YOU MUST BE VERY PROUD.

12:23.977 --> 12:27.314
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT
YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
THERE'S A CHANCE IN HELL

12:27.347 --> 12:28.916
JIMMY COULD'VE
BUILT THIS ROBOT.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.350
THAT SPARKY THING HAS TO GO.

12:30.383 --> 12:34.754
OH, BABY, COME ON. THAT'S
WHAT MAKES IT SO COOL.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.292
OK, OK, THE SPARK THING
CAN GO.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.961
AND ISN'T CHROME A LITTLE--

12:40.994 --> 12:43.396
OH, GOD, NOW THE CHROME'S
TOO MUCH.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.366
WHY CAN'T I HAVE ANY FUN?

12:46.399 --> 12:47.767
IT HAD CHROME ON IT?

12:47.801 --> 12:51.939
OH, YEAH,
AND IT HAD THESE REALLY COOL
BLINKING DIODES AND EVERYTHING,

12:51.972 --> 12:53.974
BUT CLAUDIA MADE ME
DUMB IT DOWN.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.175
OH, FOR--STOP IT.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.077
YEAH, YOU DID, BABY.

12:58.378 --> 12:59.446
HEY, BABY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:59.479 --> 13:03.083
I'M COVERING THE WELDING POINTS
WITH DIGIMON STICKERS.

13:03.116 --> 13:03.650
WHY?

13:03.683 --> 13:06.419
YOU ARC WELDED IT, SEAN.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.588
OK, THAT'S ENOUGH.
ALL RIGHT.

13:08.621 --> 13:12.292
LET'S GO SHOW 'EM
WHAT FIREBOT CAN DO, HUH?

13:12.325 --> 13:12.993
LET'S KICK SOME BOT.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.295
AHA, THAT'S CLEVER.
ALL RIGHT.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.931
* FIREBOT

13:32.079 --> 13:32.812
BABY...

13:32.846 --> 13:36.383
RIP OFF THE DAMN
DIGIMON STICKERS.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.054
Claudia: HEY, LIL.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.389
HEY, MOM. MOM,

13:42.422 --> 13:44.057
DO YOU THINK UNCLE
EDDIE IS CAPABLE

13:44.091 --> 13:46.359
OF DOING SOMETHING
REALLY BAD?

13:46.393 --> 13:47.928
ABSOLUTELY.

13:47.961 --> 13:48.962
COASTER.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.931
NO, NO, NO.
I MEAN, LIKE SERIOUSLY.

13:50.964 --> 13:51.865
DO YOU THINK HE IS?

13:51.899 --> 13:53.333
YES. WOULD YOU
LIKE ME TO MAKE
YOU A LIST?

13:53.366 --> 13:56.003
I MEAN SOMETHING
TOTALLY ILLEGAL?

13:56.036 --> 13:58.939
ARE YOU
WEARING A WIRE?

13:58.972 --> 14:05.245
NO. IT'S JUST...I THINK
UNCLE EDDIE MAY HAVE
BROKEN KELLI'S LEG.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.947
COME ON.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.917
HE COULDA DONE ANYTHING.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.928
HELLO, KELLI.

14:25.165 --> 14:28.201
OH, NO! NOT MY LEG!

14:41.048 --> 14:44.184
AAH!
I'M A DANCER!

14:51.858 --> 14:55.028
Kelli:
OW! MY LEG!
MY RIGHT LEG!

14:55.062 --> 14:56.930
COME ON. YOU'RE
BEING RIDICULOUS.

14:56.964 --> 14:58.665
THEN WHY IS HE
ACTING SO WEIRD?

14:58.698 --> 15:00.133
HE'S EDDIE. HE
ALWAYS ACTS WEIRD.

15:00.167 --> 15:04.371
I'M TELLING YOU,
HE HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.939
DO YOU WANT ME
TO ASK HIM?

15:05.973 --> 15:06.739
WOULD YOU?

15:06.773 --> 15:10.010
NO! NO, DON'T!
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW!

15:10.043 --> 15:12.445
I'M SO HAPPY.

15:14.581 --> 15:18.918
BOY, THESE
LOBSTERS ARE
SMELLING DELICIOUS.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.720
HEY, THERE'S NO
LOBSTERS IN HERE.

15:20.753 --> 15:25.525
THERE'S JUST
AN ORANGE
AND A NUTCRACKER.

15:25.558 --> 15:26.593
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

15:26.626 --> 15:30.330
HENRY? HENRY,
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH MY LOBSTERS?

15:30.363 --> 15:32.165
ED, ED, DON'T TRY
FIXIN' THIS THING.

15:32.199 --> 15:36.436
I'M NOT. I'M JUST TRYING
TO SALVAGE THE BATTERY
FOR MY TASER.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.038
OH.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.606
YOU KNOW,
TAKE WHATEVER
YOU WANT, MAN.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.541
THIS THING'S
CAUSED ME NOTHING
BUT GRIEF.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.310
YEAH, IT MUST BE
A BUMMER GETTING BEAT OUT

15:43.343 --> 15:45.045
BY A BUNCH OF KIDS.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.046
HEY, TRUST ME.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.547
THOSE KIDS
HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THOSE ROBOTS.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.749
ALEXANDER
TAKES THESE THINGS
SO SERIOUSLY.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.019
I MEAN, IT WORRIES ME,
WHAT A PERFECTIONIST
SHE IS.

15:52.052 --> 15:52.952
EVERYTHING'S GOTTA
BE JUST RIGHT.

15:52.986 --> 15:55.355
Aron:
THE PROTOTYPE WAS
A LITTLE SLUGGISH,

15:55.388 --> 15:57.757
SO PHILIP HAD
THE IDEA TO ADJUST
THE GEAR RATIO

15:57.790 --> 15:59.692
TO GET A LOT MORE
LOW-END TORQUE.

15:59.726 --> 16:00.693
ISN'T THAT
RIGHT, PHILIP?

16:00.727 --> 16:02.996
I JUST WISH
I COULD GET TYLER
TO STOP WORKING.

16:03.030 --> 16:06.299
I MEAN, HE JUST LOVES
CHALLENGING HIS MIND,

16:06.333 --> 16:09.102
WHICH I GUESS YOU CAN SEE
FROM HIS ROBOT.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.504
HA HA...JIMMY BUILT
A ROBOT, TOO.

16:11.538 --> 16:14.707
I HEAR HE'S VERY GOOD
AT KICKBALL.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.010
NEXT 2 ROBOTS,

16:17.044 --> 16:20.780
COULD YOU HAVE YOUR
HUMANS LINE YOU UP
AT THE STARTING LINE?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.215
HA-HA-HA!

16:22.249 --> 16:23.083
WE'RE DOOMED.

16:23.116 --> 16:26.486
COME ON, DAD.
WE STILL HAVE
A CHANCE.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.588
JIMMY, GROW UP.

16:30.557 --> 16:33.460
Mr. Kersey: ROBOTS READY!

16:33.493 --> 16:34.627
GREEN LIGHT TO GO!

16:34.661 --> 16:37.164
COME ON,
JIMMY! GOOD,
GOOD, GOOD!

16:37.197 --> 16:38.565
OH, GOD!
WE'RE TOAST!

16:38.598 --> 16:40.767
IT'S NOT ABOUT
SPEED, IT'S ABOUT
PRECISION.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.702
LOOK!

16:46.073 --> 16:48.007
YAY!

16:52.345 --> 16:54.047
COME ON!

16:56.516 --> 17:00.053
THEY'RE PICKING
HIM APART.

17:00.087 --> 17:02.789
OH, GOD!
SOMEONE STOP THIS!

17:03.523 --> 17:06.126
THAT'S A VIOLATION!

17:06.793 --> 17:11.131
SO, THANKS TO CLAUDIA,
WE HAD A WIMP ROBOT.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.232
WE HAD...

17:12.265 --> 17:14.801
AN AGE-APPROPRIATE ROBOT.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.703
IT WAS GETTING
PICKED ON BY ALL
THE OTHER ROBOTS.

17:16.736 --> 17:20.340
THANK GOD IT DIDN'T
HAVE ANY LUNCH MONEY.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.143
THERE WAS NO REASON
WE COULDN'T HAVE
WALKED OUT OF THAT GYM

17:23.176 --> 17:25.212
WITH A SOLID "B,"
"B-," MAYBE,

17:25.245 --> 17:27.114
BUT SEAN COULDN'T
KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.782
AND, FOR HIS
SOLAR-POWERED,

17:29.816 --> 17:31.684
WATER-IMMERSIBLE AQUABOT,

17:31.718 --> 17:35.822
A BLUE RIBBON
IS RECEIVED BY
JEFFREY HODES.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.857
SUPER GOOD JOB,
JEFFREY.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.560
WHOA! SUPER BOY!
SUPER GOOD JOB.

17:40.593 --> 17:41.661
ISN'T HE SUPER GOOD?

17:41.694 --> 17:44.131
AH, JIMMY FINNERTY.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.666
WELL, WHAT
A SUBSTANTIAL ROBOT.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.801
YOU COULD--
YOU COULD REALLY

17:48.835 --> 17:53.640
PROP A DOOR
WIDE OPEN WITH THIS.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.242
OK, OK! ENOUGH!

17:55.275 --> 17:56.576
NO, BABY.
THIS IS A MOCKERY!

17:56.609 --> 18:00.147
YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE
THAT THESE KIDS MADE
THESE THINGS, DO YOU?

18:00.180 --> 18:02.182
12-YEAR-OLDS DON'T
KNOW HOW TO BUILD
CIRCUIT BOARDS.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.217
THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS
TO TITANIUM.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.486
OR THEY CAN'T MAKE
SUBMERSIBLE ROBOTS.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.754
PHILIP, PHILIP,
PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME

18:07.787 --> 18:11.658
HOW YOU BUILT
A RETRACTABLE HYDRAULIC
ARM ON YOUR ROBOT. HUH?

18:11.691 --> 18:12.259
UH-UH-UH-UH!

18:12.292 --> 18:12.992
DON'T LOOK
FOR YOUR DAD.

18:13.025 --> 18:15.628
WHY DON'T YOU
EASE UP, FINNERTY?

18:15.662 --> 18:17.264
LOOK, COME ON.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.765
WHO ARE WE KIDDIN'?
TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.668
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW WE
ALL WANT WHAT'S BEST
FOR OUR KIDS,

18:21.701 --> 18:22.535
BUT AT WHAT COST?

18:22.569 --> 18:24.704
WE GET SO WRAPPED UP
IN THIS COMPETITION,

18:24.737 --> 18:26.906
OK, THAT WE ROB THEM
OF AN EDUCATION.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.608
AND WE'RE ALL GUILTY!

18:28.641 --> 18:30.243
EACH AND EVERY
ONE OF US.

18:30.277 --> 18:33.246
AND I, FOR ONE,
AM WILLING TO STAND UP
AND ADMIT IT.

18:33.280 --> 18:38.251
MY NAME'S SEAN FINNERTY,
AND I BUILT
MY SON'S ROBOT.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.356
THERE.

18:44.624 --> 18:49.329
WHO'S NEXT?

18:54.701 --> 18:55.568
THAT'S HOW JIMMY
GOT AN "F."

18:55.602 --> 18:58.171
HEY, HEY! I BUILT
AN "A" ROBOT, ALL RIGHT?

18:58.205 --> 18:59.939
BUT YOU WOULDN'T
LET US GO FOR IT, NO.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.341
YOU HAD TO HOLD
JIMMY BACK.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.176
OH, COME ON.
JIMMY WOULD'VE
BEEN FINE

19:03.210 --> 19:05.745
IF YOU HADN'T
GOTTEN UP ON YOUR
STUPID SOAPBOX.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.447
YOU KNOW WHAT
I THINK?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.281
WHAT?

19:08.315 --> 19:09.616
I THINK
YOU'RE BOTH
LOUSY CHEATERS,

19:09.649 --> 19:11.751
AND I CAN
ONLY HOPE THAT
SOCIAL SERVICES

19:11.784 --> 19:14.254
WILL COME IN
HERE AND TAKE
THOSE KIDS AWAY

19:14.287 --> 19:20.227
SO THAT MAYBE
THEY'LL HAVE A
CHANCE IN LIFE.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.530
BUT WHICH ONE OF US
WAS WRONGER?

19:23.563 --> 19:25.498
OH, JEEZ.

19:25.932 --> 19:28.201
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO
TALK TO JIMMY.

19:28.235 --> 19:30.270
YEAH. YOU WERE WRONGER.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.304
EXCUSE ME?

19:31.338 --> 19:32.639
NOTHING.

19:33.940 --> 19:38.345
SORRY, GUYS.
ALL WE GOT'S
PEOPLE FOOD.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.350
YOU DIDN'T SEE
ANYTHING.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.418
HEY,
I'M NO SNITCH.

19:47.620 --> 19:50.923
UNCLE EDDIE,
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

19:50.957 --> 19:51.624
SURE.

19:51.658 --> 19:52.492
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO

19:52.525 --> 19:54.861
WITH ME MAKING
THE DANCE SQUAD, DID YOU?

19:54.894 --> 19:56.629
LILY, AS FAR
AS YOU KNOW,

19:56.663 --> 20:00.233
I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU MAKING
THE DANCE SQUAD.

20:00.267 --> 20:02.769
OK, WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN?

20:02.802 --> 20:06.639
I MAY HAVE HAD A LITTLE
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.708
OH, GOD.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.443
WHAT ARE YOU
SO UPSET ABOUT?

20:10.477 --> 20:15.248
I'M THE ONE
WHO HAD TO MAKE A HUGE
PERSONAL SACRIFICE.

20:15.448 --> 20:19.652
OH, I NEVER
THOUGHT YOU LIKED ME
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.255
I WAS SHY.

20:22.289 --> 20:24.357
YOU WERE
VERY COLORFUL.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.259
YEAH, I WAS.

20:26.293 --> 20:29.429
SO

20:29.462 --> 20:32.532
YOU KNOW, THIS WOULD
MEAN A LOT TO HER,
THIS THING, YOU KNOW?

20:32.565 --> 20:36.336
OH, YES! I REMEMBER
WHEN I WAS HER AGE.

20:36.369 --> 20:39.872
THE CALL OF DANCE
CAN BE VERY
OVERWHELMING.

20:39.906 --> 20:43.843
UM, I HAD SHOES ON
WHEN I CAME IN HERE.

20:43.876 --> 20:47.914
YOU STILL DO.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.517
OH, BUT KNOW HOW IT WAS
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

20:50.550 --> 20:51.818
I WAS NEVER HAPPY
WITH WHAT WAS.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.487
I WAS ALWAYS
IMAGINING WHAT
COULD BE.

20:54.521 --> 20:57.890
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
I'D NEVER BE HAPPY

20:57.924 --> 21:00.727
UNTIL
I CHOREOGRAPHED
MY OWN STUFF.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.962
AND ONCE I DID...

21:02.995 --> 21:06.699
IT WAS JUST MAGICAL.

21:08.100 --> 21:13.373
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE
IS THANKS ENOUGH.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.310
OH, MY GOD.

21:17.344 --> 21:19.812
UNCLE EDDIE,
I THOUGHT YOU BROKE
KELLI'S LEG.

21:19.846 --> 21:23.483
I WOULD NEVER
HURT ANYONE.
I'M LIKE GANDHI.

21:24.584 --> 21:29.656
BUT YOU DID SLEEP
WITH MISS SPINOZA
AND THEN TAKE OFF?

21:30.089 --> 21:33.059
ALL RIGHT, I'M NOT
EXACTLY LIKE GANDHI.

21:38.431 --> 21:41.634
ALL RIGHT. WHO PUT
SNEAKERS IN WITH
MY TOWELS?

21:41.668 --> 21:42.769
OH, MY GOD!

21:42.802 --> 21:46.373
BOY! SOMETHING
SMELLS DELICIOUS!

21:46.406 --> 21:48.441
YEAH.

21:48.475 --> 21:49.576
WOW!

21:49.609 --> 21:50.242
OH, MAN.

21:50.276 --> 21:51.444
WELL, MY TOWELS
ARE RUINED.

21:51.478 --> 21:55.648
THESE LOBSTERS
ARE PERFECT.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.586
HEY, NOBODY USED
THE DRYER, DID THEY?

21:59.619 --> 22:00.820
NO.

22:00.853 --> 22:03.623
COME HERE, HENRY.
WE NEED TO TALK.

22:03.656 --> 22:06.659
SAVE ME A CLAW.
