00:05.740 --> 00:07.865
<i>...a longstanding source...</i>

00:07.866 --> 00:09.574
<i>Underwood will</i>
<i>speak before the committee</i>

00:09.575 --> 00:11.200
<i>today regarding</i>
<i>the allegations...</i>

00:11.201 --> 00:12.953
<i>While little is being released</i>

00:12.954 --> 00:14.830
<i>to the public, the</i>
<i>vice president's statement...</i>

00:14.831 --> 00:16.497
The vice president just entered
the Department of Justice.

00:16.498 --> 00:17.917
We're here with Ayla Sayyad,

00:17.918 --> 00:19.626
whose
<i>Wall Street Telegraph</i> article

00:19.627 --> 00:21.962
catalyzed the investigation.
Ayla.

00:21.963 --> 00:25.007
The issue at stake is whether the
White House was in any way involved.

00:25.008 --> 00:27.175
Was foreign money traded
for political favors?

00:27.176 --> 00:29.427
Did it influence
diplomatic relations?

00:29.428 --> 00:32.430
Just the act of laundering Chinese
contributions is illegal.

00:32.430 --> 00:36.392
If it had a significant impact on White House
policy, that's a far more serious crime.

00:36.393 --> 00:40.066
You've met with Daniel Lanagin
on multiple occasions.

00:40.067 --> 00:44.778
We were in the same room, yes,
on 11 occasions since 2003.

00:44.779 --> 00:48.114
But we only spoke
on three of those occasions.

00:48.115 --> 00:51.994
- Those instances are highlighted.
- What did you discuss?

00:51.995 --> 00:56.372
These were fund-raisers.
I speak to dozens of people.

00:56.373 --> 00:59.374
Usually about nothing at all.
I'm Southern, Ms. Dunbar.

00:59.375 --> 01:02.838
My mother taught me that conversation
during mealtime is not only polite,

01:02.839 --> 01:05.090
it aids the digestive process.

01:05.090 --> 01:08.675
So you didn't speak to him about
the Adohi Tribe's contributions

01:08.676 --> 01:11.053
- to any of these super PACS?
- Absolutely not.

01:11.054 --> 01:15.390
I never discuss super PACs with any supporters.
We both know the law.

01:15.391 --> 01:17.851
During one of these
polite conversations,

01:17.852 --> 01:21.312
do you recall Mr. Lanagin
ever mentioning Xander Feng?

01:21.313 --> 01:24.108
- I do not.
- Does that name mean anything to you?

01:24.109 --> 01:26.068
Other than being plastered
all over the news?

01:26.069 --> 01:28.990
In that regard, it means
as much as Kim Kardashian.

01:31.158 --> 01:35.327
Then let me be more specific.
What knowledge do you have

01:35.328 --> 01:38.873
of Mr. Feng's political
activities?

01:38.874 --> 01:44.921
- Is this coming from your husband, or is it...?
- From me.

01:44.922 --> 01:47.340
And it's not that I don't
support the bill anymore.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.425
It's just the article.

01:49.426 --> 01:51.676
We've promised
Matt an interview.

01:51.677 --> 01:55.346
Maybe in a few weeks, once the
investigation has died down.

01:55.347 --> 01:57.640
The <i> New York Times</i>
isn't going to wait for us.

01:57.641 --> 02:00.187
They've already scheduled the cover
for October, based on our timing--

02:00.188 --> 02:03.731
Then I can't be a part of it.

02:03.732 --> 02:06.526
- It's the Galloway nonsense, isn't it?
- Claire, come on.

02:06.527 --> 02:11.363
It's OK. You can say so.
We're friends.

02:11.364 --> 02:13.491
- It doesn't help.
- You don't actually believe--

02:13.492 --> 02:15.242
No.

02:15.243 --> 02:18.038
But enough of the
country still does.

02:18.039 --> 02:22.168
And Garrett needs every bit of
support he can get right now.

02:24.377 --> 02:26.670
So there's no convincing you?

02:26.671 --> 02:31.343
I'll help you as much
as I can, quietly.

02:33.803 --> 02:37.181
<i>There are rumors that you
and Mr. Feng served as back channels</i>

02:37.182 --> 02:40.642
- to the trade summit last May.
- Exactly. Rumors.

02:40.643 --> 02:43.229
We have Feng
in the US during the summit.

02:43.230 --> 02:46.439
If he was back-channeling,
and even if I were aware,

02:46.440 --> 02:48.858
any form of diplomatic communication
is usually classified.

02:48.859 --> 02:51.111
Have you ever discussed Feng
with the president?

02:51.112 --> 02:53.696
Any major player in Beijing
is worthy of discussion.

02:53.697 --> 02:56.616
- So that's a yes.
- It's a general comment.

02:56.617 --> 02:58.785
Did you discuss him
during the energy crisis?

02:58.786 --> 03:01.080
I assume you're alluding
to his refinery co-venture--

03:01.081 --> 03:04.041
- Yes, with Raymond Tusk.
- The refinery was never part of our conversation.

03:04.042 --> 03:08.378
We needed an immediate solution. A refinery
would've solved nothing in the short term.

03:08.379 --> 03:10.546
And it's my understanding
that deal fell through.

03:10.547 --> 03:12.423
Correct. But Tusk
did receive a subsidy.

03:12.424 --> 03:14.968
As did every other
nuclear energy provider.

03:14.969 --> 03:17.637
But his connection with
Feng, then a subsidy on samarium--

03:17.638 --> 03:21.015
Nobody made any profits off these subsidies.
At best they're breaking even.

03:21.016 --> 03:23.311
In fact, Raymond
fought us on the issue.

03:23.312 --> 03:27.983
Then let's back up to
the Port Jefferson Bridge.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.074

05:07.999 --> 05:10.750
I don't blame her.
It's a valid concern.

05:10.751 --> 05:13.461
Tell him I won't engage on Galloway,
so there's no point in asking.

05:13.462 --> 05:16.839
This is Matt Bai, we can't dictate
what he'll ask. And he will ask.

05:16.840 --> 05:18.883
Then I'll just say I won't
answer tabloid questions.

05:18.884 --> 05:22.390
It's a legitimate question, how the
scandal could affect the vote.

05:22.391 --> 05:26.433
Look, I say you pull out too.
We scrap the whole piece.

05:26.434 --> 05:30.019
Jackie's fighting us. The
leadership is noncommittal.

05:30.020 --> 05:32.400
We need this article
to refocus attention.

05:32.401 --> 05:36.986
But it'll hurt you, both your
personal image and the bill.

05:36.987 --> 05:40.280
But if we cut the cord, we schedule
two interviews then we cancel,

05:40.281 --> 05:43.283
won't Matt be furious? The story
will be about pulling out.

05:43.284 --> 05:45.118
We're talking about
the lesser of two evils.

05:45.119 --> 05:47.036
I don't want you to become
the target, to undo all--

05:47.037 --> 05:48.830
Then what if
it's not me at all?

05:48.831 --> 05:52.250
- You said the First Lady wasn't--
- Not her. Someone else.

05:52.251 --> 05:55.920
Was the bridge a trade-off to
prevent additional GOP funding?

05:55.921 --> 05:59.425
As far as I know, the bridge
was a delivery on a promise

05:59.426 --> 06:02.846
the president had made to the
voters. Are we finished here?

06:02.847 --> 06:04.888
Almost.

06:04.889 --> 06:07.765
How many members of Congress have you
interviewed, Ms. Dunbar? About 200?

06:07.766 --> 06:10.560
- One hundred ninety-four.
- I want to be of help,

06:10.561 --> 06:13.648
but I doubt I can offer any more
than the 194 that preceded me.

06:13.649 --> 06:17.735
- I have gotten some useful testimony.
- From who?

06:17.736 --> 06:20.069
- A high-ranking House member.
- In the leadership?

06:20.070 --> 06:22.322
- I'm not at liberty to say.
- Bob Birch? Jackie Sharp?

06:22.323 --> 06:26.200
This individual says he attended a
meeting, July 14th, in the Oval Office.

06:26.201 --> 06:28.454
She said "he."
So it must have been Birch.

06:28.455 --> 06:30.790
I'm sure Raymond had no trouble
buying him off.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.126
You attended that meeting also.

06:36.588 --> 06:39.172
- It appears so.
- You recall the subject of that meeting?

06:39.173 --> 06:42.050
A wave of conservative attack
ads. We were being outspent.

06:42.051 --> 06:44.135
It must have been quite
a shock when Lanagin's tribe

06:44.136 --> 06:46.137
shifted contributions
to the other party,

06:46.138 --> 06:48.765
when they hadn't given a single dime
to the Republicans before that.

06:48.766 --> 06:51.684
It would've been a shock, but we didn't
know where the money was coming from.

06:51.685 --> 06:53.438
- According to my source--
- Bob Birch.

06:53.439 --> 06:57.024
My source says the estimate
was 25 million.

06:57.025 --> 07:00.819
You said, and I quote:
"With this kind of influx,

07:00.820 --> 07:03.738
you can be sure somebody
isn't playing by the rules."

07:03.739 --> 07:06.950
Sounds like something I might say.
Bob has a better memory than me.

07:06.951 --> 07:10.036
The money stopped just after the
Port Jefferson Bridge was approved.

07:10.037 --> 07:12.705
Is there a theory here, or are
you just grasping at straws?

07:12.706 --> 07:16.084
The bridge leads to Feng.
Feng gives me Lanagin and Tusk.

07:16.085 --> 07:20.755
- Tusk and the President--
- Ms. Dunbar, you want to play six degrees of separation,

07:20.756 --> 07:22.717
you could throw in Jimmy Hoffa
and the pope.

07:22.718 --> 07:26.178
How about one degree
of separation.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.223
Douglas Stamper,
your chief of staff.

07:28.224 --> 07:31.475
This is him at Lanagin's casino,
July 14th.

07:31.476 --> 07:35.020
I used these to get a warrant
for flight records.

07:35.021 --> 07:39.441
The next day, Mr. Stamper
was on a flight to Beijing.

07:39.442 --> 07:43.821
Why was he at the casino?
And why was he in Beijing?

07:43.822 --> 07:47.575
- I would like to speak to my client.
- Please.

07:49.577 --> 07:51.996
I work hard.

07:51.997 --> 07:56.418
I keep things simple.
I know what my priorities are.

07:57.836 --> 08:03.132
But there's this... this person.

08:03.133 --> 08:07.345
She's not even in my life, except on
the edges making things blurrier.

08:10.223 --> 08:13.474
It doesn't tempt me to drink.
It's more like she...

08:13.475 --> 08:16.688
More like she feels what it was
like when I was drinking.

08:16.689 --> 08:20.441
When I couldn't get enough.

08:20.442 --> 08:24.195
No matter how many drinks I had,
I wanted another.

08:27.032 --> 08:29.451
I don't want to be with her.

08:31.411 --> 08:33.746
I mean, I do.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.789
But...

08:38.083 --> 08:41.462
...it's more like
she's my daughter.

08:41.462 --> 08:45.382
Or my mother.
I don't know, this is fucked up.

08:45.383 --> 08:47.468
Take your time.

08:47.469 --> 08:52.849
I should cut her off,
the way I did with booze.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.438
That's all. I'm done.

08:59.439 --> 09:01.856
- Thanks for sharing.
- Thanks for sharing.

09:01.857 --> 09:03.983
We'll need time before
responding to your questions.

09:03.984 --> 09:06.486
- I can wait as long as necessary.
- It could take a while.

09:06.487 --> 09:08.321
There are national security
matters at stake.

09:08.322 --> 09:10.073
The vice president needs to
consult with his advisors.

09:10.074 --> 09:11.950
National security?
Are you really going

09:11.951 --> 09:13.536
- to play that card, Oliver?
- His answers could entail

09:13.537 --> 09:15.120
classified material.

09:15.121 --> 09:18.039
- When can we expect a response?
- I'll let you know.

09:18.040 --> 09:20.583
- May we hold onto the screen cap?
- Be my guest.

09:20.584 --> 09:23.002
- We'll be in touch soon, Ms. Dunbar.
- Mr. Vice President.

09:23.003 --> 09:25.129
If you think you're
insulated, don't.

09:25.130 --> 09:27.590
Our investigation is much
bigger than Douglas Stamper.

09:27.591 --> 09:31.388
- That's enough, Ms. Dunbar.
- Thank you for your time, Mr. Vice President.

09:31.389 --> 09:33.722
Happy to cooperate.

09:40.021 --> 09:42.856
From the lion's den
to a pack of wolves.

09:42.857 --> 09:47.487
When you're fresh meat, kill and
throw them something fresher.

09:52.575 --> 09:54.536
Hey, I'm Fitz.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.663
Doug.

09:57.664 --> 10:02.085
You know, you can isolate,
white-knuckle this shit if you want.

10:02.086 --> 10:06.005
Or you can ask for help.
You got a sponsor?

10:06.006 --> 10:10.676
No, it's been 14 years.
I'm good.

10:10.677 --> 10:13.555
Number's on the back
if you change your mind.

10:22.439 --> 10:24.274
I thought you had a driver.

10:24.275 --> 10:29.695
I do, but I didn't want him
overhearing anything.

10:29.696 --> 10:34.073
- You shouldn't even be near this state.
- I'm not really here.

10:34.074 --> 10:36.492
Long layover on my way
to California.

10:36.493 --> 10:40.871
I've got auditors, federal agents, in
my office going through every file,

10:40.872 --> 10:43.625
every document, they're going
through my goddamn trash.

10:43.626 --> 10:45.751
Just stick to the Fifth
if she subpoenas you.

10:45.752 --> 10:49.172
How did they know to look for Stamper?
To search the tapes on that exact day?

10:49.173 --> 10:53.259
- Don't jump to conclusions.
- You're throwing me under the bus.

10:53.260 --> 10:55.345
Underwood's the roadkill,
not you.

10:55.346 --> 10:57.015
They're going to fuck me.

10:57.016 --> 11:00.059
They'll find a way.
You know that.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.687
And if that's the case, you and
your family will be taken care of.

11:04.522 --> 11:06.855
They're already
offering me a plea.

11:06.856 --> 11:09.150
You haven't even
been charged yet.

11:09.151 --> 11:13.655
- If I cooperate.
- You'll do less time. But your family will have nothing.

11:13.656 --> 11:15.448
They'll still have nothing
when you get out.

11:15.449 --> 11:17.659
You testify against Raymond
and he'll still walk,

11:17.660 --> 11:23.247
because all they'll have is your word, and
that doesn't count for much right now.

11:23.248 --> 11:25.210
You wouldn't be here
if he wasn't afraid.

11:25.211 --> 11:30.506
I'm not here because he's afraid.
I'm here because you are.

11:30.507 --> 11:32.964
And I want to make sure
you don't do anything stupid.

11:32.965 --> 11:36.094
After repeated
conversations with Beijing,

11:36.095 --> 11:38.179
they remain intractable
in their position.

11:38.180 --> 11:40.475
This morning I gave orders
for a carrier group

11:40.476 --> 11:42.685
to reposition near Okinawa.

11:42.686 --> 11:46.020
This won't put our ships in direct
confrontation with the Chinese vessels,

11:46.021 --> 11:48.189
but it will put them within
reach of air strikes.

11:48.190 --> 11:51.276
I'll be informing the Chinese
ambassador later today.

11:51.277 --> 11:54.654
We'll release a statement in
coordination with the Pentagon.

11:54.655 --> 11:58.949
Sir, our stockpiles of samarium will
only last another two months at most.

11:58.950 --> 12:01.413
- If we go this route--
- I've heard everyone's concerns,

12:01.414 --> 12:05.541
and this is the decision
I've made. Any questions?

12:05.542 --> 12:07.126
OK. Thank you.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.503
Frank.

12:13.091 --> 12:15.843
My deputy briefed me
on the latest.

12:22.933 --> 12:24.643
How did it go?

12:24.644 --> 12:27.060
We have a few follow-up
questions we have to address.

12:27.061 --> 12:28.854
- Like what?
- Nothing major.

12:28.855 --> 12:31.023
Just odds and ends,
a few details.

12:31.024 --> 12:33.403
I was under the impression
this would be short and sweet.

12:33.404 --> 12:36.363
So was I.
But she's very deliberate.

12:36.364 --> 12:40.199
We need this over, Frank, at least as
far as the White House is concerned.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.785
We can't be distracted.
Not with warships on the move.

12:42.786 --> 12:44.662
I'm confident we're
in the homestretch.

12:44.663 --> 12:46.706
You seem more concerned
than you're letting on.

12:46.707 --> 12:48.125
- Oh, no. Not at all.
- You're fidgeting.

12:48.126 --> 12:50.711
Oh...

12:50.712 --> 12:54.340
It's my class ring.
I forget I...

12:54.341 --> 12:56.883
- I buried it.
- You what?

12:56.884 --> 13:00.012
I... It's a long story.

13:01.598 --> 13:03.640
I've never seen you
this stressed before, Frank.

13:03.641 --> 13:06.351
Well, I've never seen you
this tired before, sir.

13:06.352 --> 13:08.686
You've got rings of your own,
dark ones.

13:08.687 --> 13:10.396
They're getting worse,
aren't they?

13:10.397 --> 13:12.732
You should take more naps
on those sofas in the Oval.

13:12.733 --> 13:16.363
Naps don't cut it these days,
Frank. Not even a dent.

13:20.575 --> 13:23.452
Lie after lie.

13:23.453 --> 13:26.996
First to a prosecutor,
then to a president.

13:26.997 --> 13:29.708
I feel exposed,

13:29.709 --> 13:34.713
like the skin where
my ring used to be.

13:34.714 --> 13:38.301
Even Achilles was only as strong
as his heel.

13:44.098 --> 13:46.391
Where's Doug?
He's not answering his phone.

13:46.392 --> 13:48.976
- He went to a meeting, sir.
- In the middle of the day?

13:48.977 --> 13:50.728
I think he's on
his way back now.

13:50.729 --> 13:53.232
I want him
back as soon as possible.

14:01.366 --> 14:05.119
Sir, this arrived for you. The watch you
gave Remy when he left for Glendon Hill.

14:05.120 --> 14:08.121
I recognized it from
the quote on the back.

14:08.122 --> 14:12.376
- Was there a message?
- No, just the watch.

14:12.377 --> 14:15.672
- Let's find Doug.
- Right away, sir.

14:20.552 --> 14:23.470
Forgive the plastic.

14:23.471 --> 14:26.432
Luc Tuymans.
He's the real thing.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.058
Well, I'll take your word.

14:29.059 --> 14:32.103
It's not mine. None of it.
California.

14:32.104 --> 14:36.190
You want to sell your house,
your Realtor decorates it.

14:36.191 --> 14:39.277
Well, one room at least.

14:39.278 --> 14:41.154
Where are you moving?

14:41.155 --> 14:45.534
Oh, I have a little
ranch in Sonoma.

14:45.535 --> 14:49.455
My wife's gone,
my kids won't talk to me,

14:49.456 --> 14:51.541
but at least I'll
have my painting.

14:51.542 --> 14:54.752
- You paint?
- No, and there's no ranch.

14:54.753 --> 14:59.298
But the rest of it, the
rest of it's true. Cheers.

15:03.928 --> 15:07.180
- I'm here about Jacqueline Sharp.
- Oh.

15:07.181 --> 15:09.891
- We're thinking of hiring her.
- A lobbyist?

15:09.892 --> 15:13.438
She could lose her re-elect. Not
a great time to be an incumbent.

15:13.439 --> 15:15.564
I know you two were close.

15:15.565 --> 15:20.234
So you're looking for what?
A recommendation?

15:20.235 --> 15:24.239
We have the lowest turnover of any
shop on K Street. There's a reason.

15:24.240 --> 15:28.284
What are you looking
for at Glendon Hill?

15:28.285 --> 15:32.540
- A killer instinct.
- Well, she certainly has that.

15:36.002 --> 15:39.337
Forgive me if
I'm prying, but...

15:39.338 --> 15:42.340
...did she have anything
to do with your...

15:42.341 --> 15:44.385
Departure?

15:46.095 --> 15:50.015
Jackie did what she had to do.
I'll never forgive her,

15:50.016 --> 15:53.310
but I understand
why she did it.

15:54.813 --> 15:57.231
Did what exactly?

15:58.942 --> 16:02.695
I paid cash for my ticket.
I was careful.

16:02.696 --> 16:04.321
Clearly not enough.

16:06.323 --> 16:10.409
Sir, the casino had cameras everywhere.
There was no way to avoid them.

16:10.410 --> 16:12.787
But there had to have been
thousands of hours of footage.

16:12.788 --> 16:16.626
- How they found that--
- I have to ask you a question, Doug.

16:16.627 --> 16:20.629
And I'm sorry, but I
need you to be honest.

16:20.630 --> 16:23.882
- Are you drinking again?
- God no.

16:23.883 --> 16:26.092
- Truly?
- It's not an option.

16:26.093 --> 16:28.679
Because it would explain a lot.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.304
You have every right to be
upset. This was my fault.

16:31.305 --> 16:35.102
I'm more concerned than I'm upset. I
need you now, Doug, more than ever.

16:37.313 --> 16:39.607
I know.

16:39.608 --> 16:41.025
We're not young men.

16:41.026 --> 16:43.820
If we fail, we'll die in a cage.

16:48.033 --> 16:50.702
I haven't been myself lately.

16:57.709 --> 17:00.626
That's what you said
to me 14 years ago.

17:00.627 --> 17:05.339
When I gave you a second chance, it paid off.
You got clean, Doug.

17:05.340 --> 17:07.761
Nothing means more to me
than this job, sir.

17:07.762 --> 17:10.386
Nothing.

17:10.387 --> 17:13.555
Whatever's going on, I need
to know it can be managed.

17:13.556 --> 17:16.268
And if you need my help,
I'm here to help you.

17:16.269 --> 17:21.397
I'm good, sir. I can handle myself.
Things will be different.

17:28.907 --> 17:32.576
I've never given
someone a third chance...

17:37.999 --> 17:40.835
...until this very moment.

17:42.544 --> 17:44.047
And I'm grateful.

17:45.840 --> 17:49.468
You won't regret it.
Please believe that, sir.

17:52.055 --> 17:55.058
It was Remy who alerted
them to the footage.

17:55.059 --> 17:59.687
His going-away gift.
Read the back.

18:03.482 --> 18:05.401
- What do you think he's trying to say?
- I don't know.

18:05.402 --> 18:08.736
But track him down
and set up a meeting.

18:08.737 --> 18:12.407
- What about Dunbar?
- We can't run from the facts.

18:12.408 --> 18:16.160
I'll say whatever you want me to say,
I'll take responsibility for all of it.

18:16.161 --> 18:19.958
- She could indict you.
- That's what having a staff is for.

18:21.500 --> 18:25.086
I have a better solution.
We'll both take responsibility.

18:25.087 --> 18:27.088
- How?
- Set up an interview with Dunbar,

18:27.089 --> 18:30.217
day after tomorrow. You and I
need time to do our homework.

18:30.218 --> 18:32.095
Yes, sir.

18:44.107 --> 18:50.695
- When did this happen?
- Meechum helped me fix it.

18:50.696 --> 18:53.699
They're not gonna let me run,
I have to work out some way.

18:53.700 --> 18:58.286
- You carried it all the way up here?
- For privacy. I had help.

18:58.287 --> 19:01.540
- Meechum.
- That's right.

19:02.708 --> 19:05.002
Jack-of-all-trades.

19:05.003 --> 19:09.715
- Handyman, furniture mover.
- Human shield.

19:16.555 --> 19:19.433
How bad is it?

19:23.687 --> 19:25.564
Bad.

19:27.316 --> 19:31.237
They have evidence of Doug being
where he shouldn't have been.

19:32.613 --> 19:34.573
What are you going to do?

19:38.744 --> 19:40.996
Tell the truth.

19:40.997 --> 19:43.874
- You're not actually going--
- Selectively.

19:43.875 --> 19:47.710
Don't worry.
It's a stumble, not a fall.

19:47.711 --> 19:49.838
You aren't like this
when it's just a stumble.

19:49.839 --> 19:54.135
- Like how?
- You're scared. I can tell.

19:59.682 --> 20:03.269
Five hundred meters at 139.
That was my best.

20:03.270 --> 20:04.812
Shoot for that.

20:57.573 --> 21:01.285
- How have you been?
- OK.

21:01.286 --> 21:04.121
- The meds are helping.
- Oh, that's good to hear.

21:05.539 --> 21:07.957
Have a seat.

21:07.958 --> 21:11.296
Those people at the end
of the street, it's intense.

21:11.297 --> 21:15.381
They're there 24/7.
Twice as many on the weekends.

21:15.382 --> 21:18.345
We're so used to it by now.

21:22.890 --> 21:25.557
Can I take off my shoes?

21:25.558 --> 21:28.687
I thought I should dress up,
but I am not good with heels.

21:28.688 --> 21:32.148
Yes, of course.

21:32.149 --> 21:35.069
My mom said
they went with the dress.

21:37.238 --> 21:39.240
Much better.

21:40.908 --> 21:45.371
Look, Megan, I know the last
six months have been difficult.

21:45.372 --> 21:48.789
But I need your help.
We just don't have the support

21:48.790 --> 21:50.582
that we expected
in the leadership.

21:50.583 --> 21:52.959
Yeah, I figured this wasn't
just about checking up on me.

21:52.960 --> 21:56.006
You changed your mind before,
and I understand why.

21:56.007 --> 22:00.885
But now it seems as though
things are more stable with you.

22:00.886 --> 22:05.932
- Are you willing?
- It's hard to say no when I'm in your house.

22:08.311 --> 22:12.356
You hear those
people out there.

22:12.357 --> 22:15.858
They're loud, but I think
we need to be louder.

22:15.859 --> 22:20.029
And it can't be my voice
because I'm the "baby killer."

22:20.030 --> 22:24.450
The "cheater." It needs to be your voice.
A clear voice.

22:24.451 --> 22:27.079
I'm already testifying
at the court-martial.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.915
But that's closed to the media.
It's not enough.

22:30.916 --> 22:36.463
There are so many people this has
happened to, why does it have to be me?

22:38.132 --> 22:41.134
Because you're
the one who called.

22:41.135 --> 22:44.722
Are you gonna try to put it out
before McGinnis gets sentenced?

22:44.723 --> 22:49.184
- Seth, you have a minute?
- Matt, I have to call you back.

22:55.149 --> 22:57.026
Close the door.

23:01.530 --> 23:04.992
When the vice president brought you
on board I advised against it.

23:04.993 --> 23:07.785
But I can't deny
you've done a good job.

23:07.786 --> 23:09.703
I appreciate you saying that.

23:09.704 --> 23:11.747
I'm very protective
of the vice president.

23:11.748 --> 23:13.790
I find it hard to share
that duty with anyone else,

23:13.791 --> 23:17.252
which leaves me open to error.
It's one of my faults.

23:17.253 --> 23:20.964
As I told the vice president, I understand
that trust is something I need to earn.

23:20.965 --> 23:23.428
- Given how I got the job--
- If the vice president trusts you,

23:23.429 --> 23:26.387
then I trust you.
We're a team now.

23:26.388 --> 23:29.307
And the truth
is I can't do this alone.

23:29.308 --> 23:32.936
Anything and everything
you ask of me.

23:35.898 --> 23:39.150
It might have nothing
to do with the media.

23:39.151 --> 23:43.529
- Press secretary is just a title.
- Good.

23:43.530 --> 23:46.406
We have two tasks.
First, find me Remy Danton.

23:46.407 --> 23:48.367
- But be discreet.
- I'll track him down.

23:48.368 --> 23:50.869
Second, I need you to go through
the vice president's travel logs.

23:50.870 --> 23:53.330
- Everything in the past ten years.
- What are we looking for?

23:53.331 --> 23:56.710
Anything that could hurt us. I'll
work forward, you work backward.

23:56.711 --> 23:58.002
I'm on it.

23:58.003 --> 24:00.881
And, Doug, thanks.

24:47.094 --> 24:50.389
Nancy, I need you
to order me a new phone.

25:22.379 --> 25:25.088
You said "odds and
ends." The "homestretch."

25:25.089 --> 25:27.424
I was presented with this
information just hours ago.

25:27.425 --> 25:29.092
We're talking about
impeachable offenses--

25:29.093 --> 25:31.053
- Not at all, sir.
- Your chief of staff--

25:31.054 --> 25:33.180
I had a gut feeling
that the casino was involved.

25:33.181 --> 25:34.723
I sent Doug to get
to the bottom of it.

25:34.724 --> 25:36.600
You should've
taken this to the DOJ

25:36.601 --> 25:38.185
- the first inkling you--
- That's what I didn't want.

25:38.186 --> 25:40.354
To create some ruckus
if nothing was going on?

25:40.355 --> 25:42.773
You can't go on conducting
your own investigations, Frank.

25:42.774 --> 25:45.817
Fact-finding, due diligence,
whatever you want to call it.

25:45.818 --> 25:48.570
If any laws were being broken,
I wanted to know.

25:48.571 --> 25:49.863
That's what you want
to tell Dunbar?

25:49.864 --> 25:51.073
That I didn't want to disclose

25:51.074 --> 25:52.407
our diplomatic protocols.

25:52.408 --> 25:54.201
That I was concerned
about the midterms.

25:54.202 --> 25:56.828
And I wanted to protect the
president of the United States.

25:56.829 --> 26:00.207
Maybe what I did was wrong, but
I didn't do anything illegal.

26:00.208 --> 26:03.001
- You're certain of that?
- I've discussed this with my lawyers.

26:03.002 --> 26:06.004
Dunbar does not strike me as the sort
of person who will put on the brakes,

26:06.005 --> 26:07.925
even if we admit all of this.

26:07.926 --> 26:13.221
If fact, it might encourage
her to dig deeper.

26:13.222 --> 26:17.641
You're right. Which is why I want
to hand over all of my travel logs.

26:17.642 --> 26:20.769
- And I think you should too.
- Volunteer them?

26:20.770 --> 26:24.231
- As a gesture of cooperation.
- Haven't we made enough gestures?

26:24.232 --> 26:26.735
It will take the
wind out her sails.

26:26.736 --> 26:31.114
No, I don't...
want her poring

26:31.115 --> 26:33.659
over every one
of my comings and goings.

26:33.660 --> 26:37.954
He's worried about his marriage
counseling, as he should be.

26:37.955 --> 26:40.872
If you're worried about your marriage
counseling, you shouldn't be.

26:40.873 --> 26:42.833
Imagine the fallout,
if the public were to find out--

26:42.834 --> 26:45.460
A needle in a haystack, and not
a needle Dunbar is looking for.

26:45.461 --> 26:47.879
She's interviewed half of Congress.
That woman's after blood.

26:47.880 --> 26:50.715
But not for gossip. Even if she
does raise an eyebrow,

26:50.716 --> 26:53.262
you were visiting a sick friend,
weren't you?

26:53.263 --> 26:58.809
- Ostensibly.
- Well, she couldn't possibly find any fault with that.

27:02.521 --> 27:05.397
- I'd like Galich in here.
- I'll let you two talk privately.

27:05.398 --> 27:08.608
- When are you seeing Dunbar?
- Tomorrow, so you have some time.

27:08.609 --> 27:10.068
I'll speak to Bill
and get back to you.

27:10.069 --> 27:12.612
He'll advise you against it,
which is his job.

27:12.613 --> 27:16.910
But I would just encourage you to
think politics, and not legalese.

27:16.911 --> 27:18.786
Thank you, sir.

27:25.002 --> 27:27.253
Congresswoman.

27:27.254 --> 27:29.796
Why should I vote for you?

27:29.797 --> 27:32.217
It's... it's OK. Good night.

27:36.347 --> 27:38.556
You look tired.

27:38.557 --> 27:41.934
Long day on the campaign trail?

27:41.935 --> 27:43.686
What are you doing here?

27:43.687 --> 27:47.023
You never told me
about Havemeyer's daughter.

27:47.024 --> 27:50.068
Everyone knows that.
The whole world knows.

27:50.069 --> 27:53.779
But not that you visited her.
That you leaked it.

27:53.780 --> 27:56.907
You came all the way to
California to ask me about that?

27:56.908 --> 27:59.578
I came to California
to find out about that.

27:59.579 --> 28:05.291
I offered to buy Havemeyer's
house, but he told me for nothing.

28:05.292 --> 28:09.671
You were right. It has been
a long day on the trail.

28:09.672 --> 28:12.298
It's still a close race.

28:12.299 --> 28:15.552
But not if the voters
knew how you became whip.

28:19.348 --> 28:22.891
Are you honestly
threatening me?

28:22.892 --> 28:25.228
Set up a meeting with Frank.

28:25.229 --> 28:29.690
I don't care what you talk about, as long as
you're alone and the meeting is on the books.

28:29.691 --> 28:30.983
Then you're gonna
sit down with Dunbar.

28:30.984 --> 28:32.651
I've already done my interview.

28:32.652 --> 28:34.488
Tell her Frank grilled
you on your testimony.

28:34.489 --> 28:36.947
- Perjure myself?
- Save your seat.

28:36.948 --> 28:39.866
You know what?
Tell everyone.

28:39.867 --> 28:43.995
- Think how that would play out.
- I don't care.

28:43.996 --> 28:46.916
You'd really toss yourself
off a cliff for Frank?

28:46.917 --> 28:49.876
I have zero allegiance
to Frank Underwood.

28:49.877 --> 28:53.674
I won't be manipulated by him, and I sure
as fuck won't be manipulated by you.

28:53.675 --> 28:57.176
- I'm not bluffing.
- Then I was right.

28:57.177 --> 28:59.555
- About what?
- How little I meant.

29:03.142 --> 29:04.476
That has nothing
to do with this.

29:04.477 --> 29:07.603
It has everything
to do with this.

29:07.604 --> 29:11.482
I should feel disgusted,
but I don't.

29:11.483 --> 29:14.445
Just supremely disappointed.

29:29.460 --> 29:33.337
We got the call ten minutes ago,
direct from the White House counsel.

29:33.338 --> 29:35.714
The president's
turning over everything?

29:35.715 --> 29:38.133
- From the day he took office.
- We're sure this includes

29:38.134 --> 29:40.262
- the visits to his friend?
- It has to.

29:40.263 --> 29:43.889
- It was full-security detail.
- Phenomenal.

29:43.890 --> 29:46.643
We have something
we can work with.

29:46.644 --> 29:48.978
- Now, as for my logs.
- They're clean.

29:48.979 --> 29:51.897
- You bet your life on that?
- I would.

29:51.898 --> 29:54.274
- Me too, sir.
- We've been through them twice,

29:54.275 --> 29:56.360
- backward and forward.
- My statement?

29:56.361 --> 30:00.616
- In your inbox.
- I looked it over. Seth did a nice job.

30:07.121 --> 30:09.331
We need to go wide with this
the moment the interview's over

30:09.332 --> 30:12.209
so we beat Dunbar to the punch in case
she decides to release something.

30:12.210 --> 30:14.586
I'll be at my computer ready to press
send the moment I hear from Doug.

30:14.587 --> 30:17.589
- Have either of you slept?
- We're awake, fully operational.

30:17.590 --> 30:19.593
You take a shower
and put on a fresh suit.

30:19.594 --> 30:22.221
Yes, sir.
I'll see you over there.

30:26.015 --> 30:28.309
You have at least three hours.

30:28.310 --> 30:31.061
Take a nap.
You can use my office.

30:31.062 --> 30:33.899
General McGinnis was in the
courtroom when you testified.

30:33.900 --> 30:38.903
- Yes. - Had you seen him in person,
I mean, since he assaulted you?

30:38.904 --> 30:42.323
- No.
- What was that like?

30:42.324 --> 30:46.787
- Not fun.
- Not fun how?

30:49.038 --> 30:52.124
It was hard. Really hard.

30:52.125 --> 30:55.251
Look, Megan, I agreed to change
the focus of my piece

30:55.252 --> 30:59.004
to focus on you, and, you know,
I know this has gotta be hard,

30:59.005 --> 31:01.173
but I need you to help me
out a little bit.

31:01.174 --> 31:04.678
I'm sorry, I'm not
very good at this. I'm nervous.

31:04.679 --> 31:08.264
You seemed fine when you called
into Mrs. Underwood's interview.

31:08.265 --> 31:10.728
She was there with me,
on the phone.

31:10.729 --> 31:15.398
Your nerves, I know that's been
an issue since the assault.

31:15.399 --> 31:20.362
The defense brought up what they called
emotional and mental instability.

31:20.363 --> 31:22.530
That's what always happens.

31:22.531 --> 31:25.156
The person who was attacked
gets attacked all over again.

31:25.157 --> 31:28.284
- How did that make you feel?
- It made me angry.

31:28.285 --> 31:32.499
The lawyer kept coming after me about
my panic attacks, my antidepressants.

31:32.500 --> 31:35.460
But I just kept
staring at McGinnis.

31:35.461 --> 31:39.296
I wanted him to see I could
take it. That I was strong.

31:39.297 --> 31:42.801
- I wanted to make him look away first.
- And did he?

31:42.802 --> 31:47.262
Yes, when I said he did
more than violate my body.

31:47.263 --> 31:50.223
He betrayed his country.

31:50.224 --> 31:53.018
He robbed it of a good Marine.

31:53.019 --> 31:56.062
Let's talk about the sexual assault
bill in front of Congress now.

31:56.063 --> 32:00.109
It's taken some significant opposition,
most notably from another veteran,

32:00.110 --> 32:02.361
Jacqueline Sharp.

32:02.362 --> 32:05.658
If you ask me, she's
betraying our country too.

32:08.911 --> 32:11.954
- Ms. Dunbar.
- Mr. Vice President.

32:11.955 --> 32:14.163
Thank you for giving us
a few extra days.

32:14.164 --> 32:17.876
I have no problem being patient as long
as it leads to forthright answers.

32:17.877 --> 32:20.380
Well, I won't make you
wait a moment longer.

32:25.385 --> 32:27.095
Shall we?

32:28.388 --> 32:29.971
Oh, you found it.

32:29.972 --> 32:31.807
Have a seat, we're just
finishing up here.

32:31.808 --> 32:35.393
What do you think, Mr. Tusk? Keep
growing it or have it shaved?

32:35.394 --> 32:38.941
- I guess I'll keep growing it.
- No problem. Let me clean up the back.

32:38.942 --> 32:43.821
No, Mack, if you'd give me
a couple minutes. Appreciate it.

32:46.280 --> 32:49.950
I had this place built down here
about ten years ago.

32:49.951 --> 32:52.788
I got tired of driving all the
way across town every two weeks.

32:52.789 --> 32:56.415
- Now it's just an elevator ride.
- Convenient.

32:56.416 --> 33:01.838
You know what isn't convenient?
Cramming eight attorneys in my office.

33:01.839 --> 33:06.466
It was not designed for the entire
partnership of my law firm.

33:06.467 --> 33:08.970
They're worried about Lanagin.

33:08.971 --> 33:12.432
- He's a little shaky, but he'll hold up.
- Underwood?

33:12.433 --> 33:14.892
Birch delivered.

33:14.893 --> 33:19.230
- And did Dunbar bring up Stamper?
- The sessions are closed-door,

33:19.231 --> 33:22.232
but I can't imagine she didn't.

33:22.233 --> 33:26.989
And what about poor Havemeyer? Was
he any help to us on Jackie Sharp?

33:31.785 --> 33:36.496
I do not take your hesitation
as a promising sign.

33:36.497 --> 33:39.709
I never like disappointing you.

33:39.710 --> 33:41.919
- He had nothing?
- No.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.503
Hm...

33:43.504 --> 33:46.048
Now, do you think that's
because there's nothing there,

33:46.049 --> 33:49.425
- or because he's protecting her?
- There's nothing there.

33:49.426 --> 33:51.722
- I can go to another congressman.
- No, no, no.

33:51.723 --> 33:54.849
It has to be somebody
high-profile,

33:54.850 --> 33:56.975
someone in the leadership
who will make waves.

33:56.976 --> 33:59.813
- Let me get back to Birch.
- It's too obvious,

33:59.814 --> 34:03.066
now that he's shown
no sympathy for Frank.

34:03.067 --> 34:07.070
This can't look orchestrated.
Multiple fronts, Remy.

34:07.071 --> 34:10.907
It has to be
Jackie Sharp. Mack?

34:10.908 --> 34:13.491
Let's finish up here.
I gotta get back to work.

34:13.492 --> 34:15.913
- You got it, boss.
- You need to get back to work too.

34:18.456 --> 34:23.335
And what we discussed...
make it happen.

34:23.335 --> 34:26.212
- You denied being a back channel.
- I did not deny.

34:26.213 --> 34:28.924
I chose not to confirm
because it was classified.

34:28.925 --> 34:32.217
- But your office has consistently--
- I instructed Doug to do so,

34:32.219 --> 34:35.806
along with my communications department.
When a back channel becomes public,

34:35.806 --> 34:38.641
- it defeats its purpose.
- An orchestrated deception--

34:38.641 --> 34:41.686
If we had refused to comment, it
would've suggested it was true,

34:41.687 --> 34:44.397
which would've endangered the
process. I really had no choice.

34:44.398 --> 34:46.482
- Mr. Feng is currently in Dubai.
- I know.

34:46.483 --> 34:50.405
He's fleeing corruption charges, not
the first time he's been accused.

34:50.406 --> 34:54.366
- And your question?
- I know he laundered the money.

34:54.367 --> 34:58.285
It's just a matter of time before I
have the proof to substantiate that.

34:58.286 --> 35:02.001
So my question, which I am asking
again, is whether you knew?

35:02.002 --> 35:05.711
And I'll repeat my answer.
I did not.

35:05.712 --> 35:10.007
I did sense that something was awry.
Doug was aware of my concerns.

35:10.008 --> 35:13.718
And I took it upon myself to find out.
The vice president didn't know.

35:13.719 --> 35:16.138
You had no knowledge he was
going to the casino?

35:16.139 --> 35:20.349
None. But that doesn't mean I don't take
responsibility for my staff's behavior.

35:20.350 --> 35:22.896
- The buck stops with me.
- And what did you find?

35:22.897 --> 35:25.648
Nothing.
No illegal activity.

35:26.900 --> 35:29.026
I don't have the same
resources that you do.

35:29.027 --> 35:33.446
If you suspected, why didn't you go
immediately to the NIGC, the BIA,

35:33.447 --> 35:35.907
- the Department--
- You have to understand, we're facing

35:35.908 --> 35:38.325
very difficult midterms.
I didn't want to bring attention

35:38.326 --> 35:40.954
to a series of allegations that
may have no basis in fact.

35:40.955 --> 35:45.125
Now, that may have been misguided
logic, but that's how I chose to act.

35:45.126 --> 35:49.670
The mistake is mine and mine alone. Not
Doug's, certainly not the president's.

35:49.671 --> 35:52.381
It shouldn't surprise you
if I say it feels

35:52.382 --> 35:54.800
like I am not getting
the full picture.

35:54.801 --> 35:58.681
Which is why I'm prepared to give
you the full picture. Oliver?

35:58.682 --> 36:02.642
The White House believes
in transparency.

36:02.643 --> 36:04.518
All of the vice president's
personal travel logs.

36:04.519 --> 36:07.189
And the last ten years
since I became whip.

36:07.190 --> 36:10.860
As well as the
president's since inauguration.

36:10.861 --> 36:16.323
There should be no doubt
as to whom we met with and when.

36:16.324 --> 36:20.534
- I am skeptical about what this contains.
- Which is what we anticipated,

36:20.535 --> 36:23.746
and why Oliver will walk you through
anything you might need to know.

36:23.747 --> 36:27.086
It's all there, but if you have
any questions or requests,

36:27.087 --> 36:29.796
we'll be happy to facilitate.

36:33.549 --> 36:35.925
I mean, at first,
I was really nervous,

36:35.926 --> 36:38.136
but then, as soon as I
started getting into it,

36:38.137 --> 36:41.889
started speaking from my heart,
all these things poured out,

36:41.890 --> 36:45.434
everything I wanted to say,
that I've been wanting to say.

36:45.435 --> 36:47.728
Seth told me that Matt
was very impressed.

36:47.729 --> 36:49.984
- I want to do more.
- More interviews?

36:49.985 --> 36:53.610
Articles, TV,
whatever it takes.

36:53.611 --> 36:56.698
- I want to help.
- That's great, Megan.

36:58.324 --> 37:00.202
Thank you for making me do this.

37:00.203 --> 37:05.289
- It was a big step for me.
- You have a plane to catch.

37:05.290 --> 37:07.542
I can stay longer,
if you need me to do another.

37:12.588 --> 37:14.505
Why don't you head
back to Chicago.

37:14.506 --> 37:17.800
And as soon as we've put a plan
together, we can give you a buzz.

37:17.801 --> 37:20.928
- Can I get a glass of water?
- Tap is fine, or you want bottled?

37:20.929 --> 37:24.310
- I can get it.
- We've got Ms. Hennessey's car ready.

37:24.311 --> 37:27.020
Edward.

37:28.938 --> 37:31.647
Did she seem all right when you
picked her up from the airport?

37:31.648 --> 37:33.860
- How do you mean?
- I don't know, normal?

37:33.861 --> 37:35.944
Yes, I'd say so.

37:35.945 --> 37:39.072
She's very up and down,
very skittish and manic.

37:39.073 --> 37:42.328
I guess she did seem nervous.
We didn't talk much.

37:44.330 --> 37:47.790
- I'll get her.
- I'll be outside.

37:52.296 --> 37:54.380
Megan?

37:58.718 --> 37:59.844
I've got it.

38:02.264 --> 38:05.184
Really, I'm OK.

38:11.647 --> 38:13.775
The car's ready,
whenever you are.

38:17.321 --> 38:21.449
- Thank you for everything.
- Have a safe flight. I'll be in touch.

39:07.662 --> 39:10.748
I just had a very productive
interview with Ms. Dunbar.

39:10.749 --> 39:14.919
- Send out the press release.
- Thank you very much.

39:27.473 --> 39:31.100
- You OK, ma'am?
- I'm fine. I just dropped...

39:31.101 --> 39:33.811
- Please, let me.
- Oh, it's fine. I'm fine.

39:33.812 --> 39:36.691
- I've got it. You're barefoot.
- Edward, you don't have to. Really.

39:37.900 --> 39:40.151
- Oh, no, what happened?
- Damn it.

39:40.152 --> 39:43.281
- Let me get some bandages.
- You don't have to.

39:43.282 --> 39:46.158
No, I want to. Stay here.

39:46.159 --> 39:49.118
The coverage has been
mostly positive so far.

39:49.119 --> 39:53.166
- Dunbar's office?
- All they've said is they look forward to reviewing logs.

39:53.167 --> 39:56.168
- Any heat on Doug?
- Some.

39:56.169 --> 39:58.586
I'm getting a lot
of requests for comments.

39:58.587 --> 40:02.300
I acted on my own and will fully
cooperate with the Justice Department.

40:02.301 --> 40:05.428
- We can put that out?
- Sir?

40:05.429 --> 40:10.014
- It might generate more interest.
- On me, not the vice president.

40:10.015 --> 40:12.518
- I can handle whatever comes my way.
- Put it out.

40:12.519 --> 40:16.522
I'll print you out the most
recent clips too, sir.

40:21.736 --> 40:26.322
- Should I find a way to tip off Dunbar?
- Let nature take its course.

40:26.323 --> 40:28.783
We got ahold of Remy.
He just got back to town.

40:28.784 --> 40:31.621
- Where is he?
- I've arranged everything with your detail.

40:33.539 --> 40:37.251
- You've done good work, Doug.
- Thank you, sir.

41:37.729 --> 41:40.857
There, that's much better.

41:41.567 --> 41:43.943
Thanks, ma'am.

41:46.654 --> 41:49.698
I'm gonna get going.

41:49.699 --> 41:55.413
- I'm sorry, I'm a little drunk.
- It's your house. You can do whatever you want.

41:56.748 --> 41:58.372
You should
have a glass of wine.

41:58.373 --> 42:00.124
I appreciate that,
ma'am, but I--

42:00.125 --> 42:03.463
- You're off your shift, right?
- I am. That's true.

42:03.464 --> 42:07.466
Then I won't
take no for an answer.

42:07.467 --> 42:11.262
You shouldn't waste any
of your good stuff on me. I'm...

42:11.263 --> 42:14.139
I don't really know
anything about wine.

42:14.140 --> 42:18.352
Then how about bourbon? I bet
you'd like a little of that.

42:18.353 --> 42:21.230
I definitely don't mind a
bourbon from time to time.

42:21.231 --> 42:23.316
Then bourbon it is.

42:38.915 --> 42:42.709
You're a tough man
to track down these days.

42:42.710 --> 42:45.921
You got the watch?

42:45.922 --> 42:47.798
"To improve is to change."

42:47.799 --> 42:50.509
"To perfect is
to change often."

42:50.510 --> 42:52.428
What sort of change
are you looking for?

42:52.429 --> 42:58.058
- Whichever leaves me options.
- Trouble at Glendon Hill?

42:58.059 --> 43:00.768
Paid leave until the
investigation is over.

43:00.769 --> 43:02.647
Well, at least
you're being paid.

43:02.648 --> 43:05.941
First step in terminating
my partnership.

43:05.942 --> 43:07.818
You know how things go.

43:07.819 --> 43:10.947
No matter what happens, there's
a stain I can't wash out.

43:10.948 --> 43:14.324
So you're looking
for career opportunities.

43:14.325 --> 43:16.911
I'm not offering myself
to you wholesale.

43:16.912 --> 43:20.372
I keep fighting you,
but I can fight you less.

43:20.373 --> 43:25.377
- And by "less" you mean...
- Enough to hurt, but not finish you.

43:25.378 --> 43:28.462
And in return, I have a
future beyond Glendon Hill.

43:28.463 --> 43:31.257
- Whatever that might look like.
- So you're offering neutrality.

43:31.258 --> 43:35.263
- But you'll go with the victor.
- I figure let the best man win.

43:35.264 --> 43:41.977
And if you go down, it won't be because of me.
That's worth something.

43:41.978 --> 43:46.524
- Where's this coming from?
- Insurance, that's all.

43:48.067 --> 43:51.529
Does it have anything to do
with Jackie?

43:56.242 --> 43:59.494
That's over.

43:59.495 --> 44:02.415
I know you've got Birch in your pocket.
Womack's not an option.

44:02.416 --> 44:06.293
We're too close.
But Jacqueline...

44:06.294 --> 44:09.589
This is about my future, pure and simple.
She's not a part of it.

44:11.674 --> 44:16.179
Keep the watch,
as a token of good faith.

44:24.562 --> 44:27.606
He might deny it,
but he's protecting her.

44:27.607 --> 44:30.443
What he doesn't realize
is that I have even less regard

44:30.444 --> 44:33.778
for Jackie than Raymond does.
Poor Remy.

44:33.779 --> 44:39.452
The heart can choke the mind when all
its blood flows back unto itself.

45:33.423 --> 45:37.802
He said, "I don't like brunettes."

45:44.891 --> 45:47.061
Looks like
I almost missed the party.

45:47.062 --> 45:50.731
- I'm off the clock, sir.
- Oh, relax.

45:50.732 --> 45:55.111
Francis, I broke a glass and Edward
cut his hand on a piece of it.

45:55.112 --> 45:58.321
- Jesus!
- Oh, wow, it needs a change.

45:58.322 --> 46:02.035
Take that off
and I'll get fresh...

46:05.954 --> 46:10.250
I hope you don't mind, sir.
I was off duty...

46:10.251 --> 46:15.423
- Is she...?
- Drunk? A little.

46:17.091 --> 46:22.011
- How many of these have you had?
- A few.

46:22.012 --> 46:24.348
More than a few.

46:28.770 --> 46:33.191
- May I? Mm.
- Please.

46:38.154 --> 46:40.530
Let me see.

46:40.531 --> 46:42.617
It's not too bad.

46:46.245 --> 46:50.458
- There's a lot of blood.
- Looks worse than it is.

46:52.585 --> 46:54.252
Ow...

46:54.253 --> 46:57.964
- Is it painful?
- The bourbon helps.

47:00.926 --> 47:03.554
You let me know if this hurts.

47:07.517 --> 47:09.101
Not one bit, sir.

49:48.218 --> 49:51.387
- How's your head?
- Fine.

49:51.388 --> 49:54.642
I took a couple of aspirin
before I went to sleep.

49:54.643 --> 49:57.061
You?

49:58.228 --> 50:00.939
I slept like a baby.

50:00.940 --> 50:03.066
Good.

50:03.067 --> 50:05.193
You needed that.

50:19.876 --> 50:22.084
- What is it?
- Something weird.

50:22.085 --> 50:24.254
- This one address keeps popping up.
- Underwood?

50:24.255 --> 50:26.339
The president.

50:39.937 --> 50:43.231
- Good morning, Meechum.
- Good morning, Mr. Vice President.

50:45.109 --> 50:47.194
It's a beautiful day.
