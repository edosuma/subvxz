00:19.152 --> 00:20.517
Welcome to Earth.

00:20.587 --> 00:24.387
l am Admiral Bullock and l will
be your commanding officer

00:24.457 --> 00:26.152
for the next six months.

00:26.226 --> 00:28.922
Questions, comments--
bring them to me.

00:28.995 --> 00:33.227
Problems--
talk to Lieutenant Kinis.

00:33.299 --> 00:34.823
Larson...

00:34.934 --> 00:37.198
you're assigned
to the Federation Counsel

00:37.303 --> 00:38.565
Deputy Liaison Officer.

00:38.671 --> 00:42.471
Young and Reiskin, report
to Orbital Flight Control.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.306
You'll be monitoring incoming
vessels from the Bolian sector.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.369
Report back
to your commanding officer

00:47.447 --> 00:49.813
as soon as you've completed
your assignments.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.890
l can save you
some time there, son.

03:10.957 --> 03:12.891
They're bamboo.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.459
l know that.

03:14.527 --> 03:17.428
Unfortunately, my tricorder
is reading them as maple trees.

03:17.497 --> 03:19.692
l think the isodyne relays
must be malfunctioning.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.893
Well, why don't you pay a
visit to Logistical Support?

03:22.001 --> 03:23.662
Maybe they'll issue
you a new one.

03:23.770 --> 03:24.702
Good idea.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.170
l'm going that way myself.

03:26.239 --> 03:27.228
Mind some company?

03:27.340 --> 03:28.307
Not at all.

03:28.408 --> 03:30.569
So, what's your assignment here?

03:30.643 --> 03:31.769
l don't know.

03:31.844 --> 03:33.744
l haven't received
my orders yet.

03:33.813 --> 03:34.745
l just arrived.

03:34.814 --> 03:35.746
From where?

03:35.815 --> 03:37.840
A three-year tour
on the lntrepid.

03:37.917 --> 03:39.145
ls that a fact?

03:39.219 --> 03:41.847
l thought the lntrepid was
patrolling the Neutral Zone.

03:41.921 --> 03:46.153
lt is. l caught a transport
vessel at Deep Space 7.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.718
Got tired of wrestling
with the Romulans?

03:49.796 --> 03:51.957
Let's just say
it's good to be back.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.192
What about yourself?

03:54.300 --> 03:56.666
How long have you been
posted here, Mister...?

03:56.769 --> 03:59.738
Boothby. Boothby is the name.

03:59.839 --> 04:01.136
Boothby, l've heard of you.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.265
l should hope so.

04:02.342 --> 04:05.243
l've been tending these
grounds for 54 years.

04:05.311 --> 04:07.575
Give or take a few months.

04:07.647 --> 04:08.875
And beautiful grounds they are.

04:09.015 --> 04:10.004
Mm-hmm.

04:11.784 --> 04:12.842
Logistical Support.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.819
Straight through
the main complex,

04:14.887 --> 04:16.353
second door on your right.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.821
Thank you.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.414
Commander.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.459
Logistics is a secure area.

04:21.527 --> 04:24.894
They won't let you in
with that holo-imaging device.

04:24.964 --> 04:26.727
Fresh from the Neutral Zone...

04:26.799 --> 04:29.427
You're not a Romulan
double agent are you, son?

04:29.535 --> 04:31.901
Actually, l was just
recording a few images

04:31.971 --> 04:33.370
for my friends back home.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.270
Would you mind
posing for a shot?

04:35.341 --> 04:37.673
Me? You want a picture of me?

04:37.744 --> 04:38.711
The one and only Boothby.

04:38.811 --> 04:40.039
My friends would be impressed.

04:40.113 --> 04:43.082
Well, when you put it that way.

04:43.149 --> 04:44.582
Cadet!

04:44.651 --> 04:45.982
Take our picture, will you?

04:49.522 --> 04:51.456
Don't cut off our heads.

04:57.397 --> 04:59.888
l expect a copy of that,
young man.

05:26.092 --> 05:27.559
You're in my seat.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.520
And you're reading my book.

05:31.597 --> 05:34.327
You want my drink, too?

05:34.434 --> 05:36.561
Depends. What is it?

05:36.669 --> 05:40.605
Klingon martini-- vermouth,
gin, with a dash of bloodwine.

05:40.673 --> 05:43.938
Bloodwine--
never touch the stuff.

05:44.077 --> 05:46.375
What do you like?

05:46.446 --> 05:49.142
Excuse me, l was
waiting for a friend.

05:49.215 --> 05:50.876
Valerie Archer.

05:50.950 --> 05:52.440
Hayek. Jason Hayek.

05:52.518 --> 05:53.450
Nice tattoo.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.180
l bet there's a story behind it.

05:55.254 --> 05:58.621
A long one.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.318
A Cave Beyond Logic:

06:00.393 --> 06:03.829
Vulcan Perspectives
on Platonic Thought.

06:03.896 --> 06:05.454
Sounds fascinating.

06:05.531 --> 06:06.964
You can borrow it if you like.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.398
Thanks anyway.
l can only take

06:08.501 --> 06:10.435
small doses
of Vulcan philosophy.

06:10.503 --> 06:12.130
Stationed here?

06:12.238 --> 06:13.569
Temporarily.

06:13.639 --> 06:15.129
Where do you call home?

06:17.744 --> 06:20.508
You first.
Where are you from?

06:20.580 --> 06:23.640
Everywhere. My parents
were starship officers.

06:23.716 --> 06:27.049
By the time l was ten,
l'd seen half the Quadrant.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.382
Starfleet brat.

06:28.454 --> 06:30.183
Bratty as they come.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.127
Can l ask you a question?

06:45.238 --> 06:47.138
Have you ever reverted?

06:47.206 --> 06:49.572
Reverted?

06:49.642 --> 06:50.939
Not yet.

06:51.077 --> 06:54.205
Ensign O'Halloran, this is
his third time this week.

06:54.280 --> 06:57.579
lf it happens again, they'll
pull him out of training.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.481
What about you?

06:59.552 --> 07:00.883
Any trouble?

07:01.020 --> 07:02.647
Oh, l can keep my human form.

07:02.722 --> 07:04.815
lt's the little things
that bother me.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.221
Little things?

07:06.292 --> 07:07.623
Breathing oxygen,

07:07.693 --> 07:09.752
bipedal locomotion,
and sleeping--

07:09.829 --> 07:13.356
the concept of being unconscious
for eight hours a night,

07:13.433 --> 07:14.832
it's so... alien.

07:15.001 --> 07:16.025
l know what you mean.

07:16.135 --> 07:17.830
That's why l started
reading their books.

07:17.970 --> 07:20.336
For some reason,
it helps me relax.

07:20.406 --> 07:23.136
But we shouldn't be
talking about this.

07:23.209 --> 07:26.337
Think human. Talk human.
Be human. Remember?

07:26.412 --> 07:29.745
How could l forget?

07:29.816 --> 07:32.011
So, had a chance
to take a look around?

07:32.084 --> 07:33.813
Not yet.

07:33.886 --> 07:35.820
Headquarters has
a lot more to offer

07:35.888 --> 07:37.879
than conference rooms
and consoles...

07:37.990 --> 07:39.514
if you have the right guide.

07:39.592 --> 07:41.685
ls that an invitation?

07:41.761 --> 07:44.195
l get off duty at 1900 hours.

07:44.263 --> 07:45.195
Commander.

07:45.264 --> 07:46.697
Speak of the devil.

07:46.766 --> 07:50.167
We were just discussing
Vulcan philosophy.

07:50.269 --> 07:51.361
Join us.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.938
Another time perhaps.

07:53.005 --> 07:54.404
We have work to do.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.465
Oh, can't it wait?

07:56.576 --> 07:58.237
l'm afraid not.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.710
What about tonight?

07:59.779 --> 08:01.076
Do we have a date?

08:01.180 --> 08:02.112
1900 hours--

08:02.148 --> 08:03.581
meet you right here.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.048
l'll do my best.

08:05.117 --> 08:06.812
Live long and prosper.

08:09.622 --> 08:11.419
A ''date''?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.686
Relax, Tuvok.
l plan on standing her up.

08:13.759 --> 08:16.728
We agreed to limit our
investigation to surveillance.

08:16.796 --> 08:18.195
lt was worth the risk.

08:18.264 --> 08:19.822
She talked about training.

08:19.899 --> 08:22.868
These are some kind of aliens
learning to pose as humans.

08:22.969 --> 08:23.958
For what purpose?

08:24.070 --> 08:25.731
l don't know.
l didn't get that far.

08:25.838 --> 08:28.500
We're due back at the
transporter coordinates.

08:36.115 --> 08:37.412
Excuse me! Gentlemen!

08:37.482 --> 08:40.212
You've entered a restricted
area, captains and above.

08:40.285 --> 08:41.650
Sorry, we didn't realize...

08:41.721 --> 08:44.053
l'm going to have
to ask you to come with me.

08:44.123 --> 08:45.055
Why?

08:45.124 --> 08:46.557
All unauthorized personnel

08:46.626 --> 08:48.890
are to be debriefed
by Starfleet lntelligence.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.189
Direct orders
from Admiral Bullock.

08:51.264 --> 08:54.199
Listen, Ensign, we're late for a
meeting with Starfleet Command.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.734
The debriefing
will have to wait.

08:55.835 --> 08:57.427
l'm sorry, Commander.

09:01.340 --> 09:02.307
Very well.

09:04.577 --> 09:06.272
When he regains consciousness,

09:06.345 --> 09:08.108
he'll no doubt want
to report this incident.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.671
Chakotay to Paris.
Three to beam up.

09:10.750 --> 09:11.682
Three?

09:11.751 --> 09:13.048
l'll explain later.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.282
Who's that?

09:19.358 --> 09:20.825
One of Starfleet's finest.

09:20.927 --> 09:22.087
Take us to Voyager.

09:22.161 --> 09:24.561
What did you find down there?

09:24.630 --> 09:25.927
Earth.

09:37.176 --> 09:38.507
Welcome aboard.

09:39.545 --> 09:41.274
Where am l?

09:41.347 --> 09:42.644
On a starship.

09:42.715 --> 09:44.080
What starship?

09:44.150 --> 09:45.879
Why have you brought me here?

09:45.985 --> 09:47.748
l'll be reporting this
incident to the Admiral.

09:47.820 --> 09:49.754
You can drop the charade.
We know you're not human.

09:49.822 --> 09:50.880
Who are you?

09:50.990 --> 09:53.151
Gentry, David.

09:53.225 --> 09:55.887
Rank: Ensign.

09:55.995 --> 09:59.226
Starfleet service number
9-9-beta-3-2-7-8.

09:59.298 --> 10:00.629
Planet of origin: Earth.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.794
We're not interested in your
knowledge of human culture.

10:03.903 --> 10:06.064
We're not part
of your re-creation.

10:06.172 --> 10:08.231
l'm Captain Janeway

10:08.341 --> 10:10.741
of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.072
l'm from Earth.

10:12.144 --> 10:13.406
You're not.

10:13.479 --> 10:16.039
Gentry, David.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.548
Rank: Ensign.

10:17.617 --> 10:21.610
Starfleet Service Number
9-9-beta-3-2-7-8.

10:21.687 --> 10:23.086
Doctor.

10:23.155 --> 10:25.055
What are you doing?

10:25.124 --> 10:26.785
l need a sample of your DNA.

10:26.859 --> 10:28.121
Why?

10:28.194 --> 10:29.752
Since you won't
tell us who you are,

10:29.829 --> 10:31.956
we have no choice
but to find out for ourselves.

10:32.098 --> 10:33.395
You won't be harmed.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.525
Gentry to Headquarters.
Security alert!

10:35.635 --> 10:37.034
We've disabled your combadge.

10:37.803 --> 10:38.770
No!

10:39.805 --> 10:40.897
Don't touch me.

10:41.007 --> 10:42.599
Disease!

10:42.708 --> 10:44.141
Humans!

10:53.019 --> 10:54.850
lt appears he's released

10:54.920 --> 10:57.388
a cellular toxin
into his bloodstream.

10:57.456 --> 10:58.923
He's dead.

11:04.430 --> 11:06.660
Captain's Log, supplemental.

11:06.732 --> 11:09.326
Until we know
exactly what's going on,

11:09.435 --> 11:12.893
l'm keeping Voyager concealed
behind a class-3 moon.

11:13.072 --> 11:15.632
Federation Council,
Astrophysics,

11:15.741 --> 11:17.675
Starfleet Medical Complex.

11:17.743 --> 11:19.870
They even re-created
the officers' club--

11:19.945 --> 11:21.378
the Quantum Cafe.

11:21.447 --> 11:23.745
Computer, return
to time index 4228.

11:25.918 --> 11:26.850
That's Boothby.

11:26.919 --> 11:27.886
Captain?

11:27.953 --> 11:30.820
The head groundskeeper
at Starfleet Academy.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.152
When l was a cadet,

11:32.224 --> 11:34.715
he used to give me fresh
roses for my quarters.

11:34.794 --> 11:37.388
lt's safe to assume
this individual is not Boothby.

11:37.463 --> 11:39.328
Whoever they are,
they've gathered

11:39.398 --> 11:42.890
incredibly accurate information
about Starfleet Headquarters.

11:43.002 --> 11:45.436
Perhaps they had access
to a Federation database.

11:45.504 --> 11:47.768
Or they've been
to San Francisco.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.808
The habitat's population
consists

11:49.875 --> 11:52.275
of humans, Vulcans,
Bolians, Ferengi...

11:52.344 --> 11:54.278
All Alpha Quadrant species.

11:54.346 --> 11:55.472
What do we know

11:55.548 --> 11:57.539
about this artificial
environment, Seven?

11:57.616 --> 11:59.015
l've used the tricorder data

11:59.085 --> 12:00.677
holo-images
and astrometric scans

12:00.753 --> 12:03.620
to extrapolate a cross-section
of the interior.

12:03.689 --> 12:05.782
l believe they used
a combination

12:05.858 --> 12:09.021
of holographic projection
and particle synthesis.

12:09.095 --> 12:10.187
Power source?

12:10.262 --> 12:11.524
There are 13

12:11.597 --> 12:13.326
thermionic generators
beneath the city.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.162
l can't identify
the energy signatures.

12:15.267 --> 12:16.598
The habitat's heavily fortified.

12:16.702 --> 12:18.693
They are well prepared
to defend against an attack.

12:18.804 --> 12:19.828
Sick Bay to Captain.

12:19.939 --> 12:20.871
Go ahead.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.601
l've completed
my postmortem analysis.

12:22.675 --> 12:23.903
You'd better get down here.

12:23.976 --> 12:26.376
On my way.
lf this is a training ground,

12:26.445 --> 12:30.245
it could mean they're planning
an invasion of the Federation.

12:30.316 --> 12:32.409
We should prepare for the worst.

12:34.520 --> 12:37.751
See if you can find a way
to penetrate their defenses.

12:42.795 --> 12:44.888
He may look human,
he may sound human,

12:44.964 --> 12:46.295
he may even smell human,

12:46.365 --> 12:48.060
but there's no question--
he's alien.

12:48.167 --> 12:49.896
Was he genetically altered?

12:50.002 --> 12:52.232
On a highly sophisticated level.

12:52.338 --> 12:53.896
lf it weren't
for microcellular scans,

12:54.006 --> 12:55.598
l wouldn't be able
to distinguish him

12:55.708 --> 12:57.369
from the genuine article.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.877
l've managed to isolate
the alien DNA.

12:59.945 --> 13:03.540
Fortunately, most of his cells
are still chemically active.

13:03.649 --> 13:06.083
lf l use
a cytokinetic injection,

13:06.118 --> 13:09.144
l should be able to trigger
a genetic reversion.

13:09.221 --> 13:11.189
Do it.

13:41.954 --> 13:46.653
Talk about a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

13:46.725 --> 13:48.158
Species 8472.

13:48.227 --> 13:49.660
The question is:

13:49.728 --> 13:53.357
Why are they training
to pose as human beings?

13:53.432 --> 13:54.660
Back in the 20th century,

13:54.733 --> 13:56.758
the Soviets used
to build American towns

13:56.869 --> 13:59.736
to train their agents to
infiltrate the United States.

13:59.805 --> 14:02.501
Species 8472 could be doing
the same thing.

14:02.608 --> 14:03.540
They're going

14:03.576 --> 14:05.339
to infiltrate
the Alpha Quadrant.

14:05.411 --> 14:07.003
Maybe they already have.

14:07.079 --> 14:08.842
Tom's right.
How else could they

14:08.914 --> 14:10.973
have gathered their
information about us?

14:11.050 --> 14:13.041
Perhaps they acquired it
from the Borg.

14:13.118 --> 14:15.018
lt doesn't matter
how they got their data.

14:15.087 --> 14:17.487
We need to find out
what they intend to do with it.

14:17.556 --> 14:20.184
lf our previous experience
is any indication,

14:20.259 --> 14:22.386
they will try to destroy Earth.

14:22.461 --> 14:23.894
A logical assumption.

14:23.963 --> 14:26.830
They did threaten to purge
our galaxy of all life.

14:26.899 --> 14:28.833
Tuvok, keep working on a way

14:28.901 --> 14:31.165
to target
their habitat's power source.

14:31.270 --> 14:34.706
We're going to need nanoprobe
warheads and plenty of them.

14:34.807 --> 14:36.365
Seven, see to it.

14:36.475 --> 14:37.908
Yes, Captain.

14:37.977 --> 14:40.468
ln the meantime,
l've got a date to keep.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.343
l made contact
with one of them--

14:42.414 --> 14:44.177
Commander Valerie Archer.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.514
Maybe l can capitalize
on the relationship,

14:46.585 --> 14:48.917
get a better idea
of what they're planning.

14:48.988 --> 14:51.786
Tom, Harry, take him back
in the Delta Flyer.

14:51.857 --> 14:54.382
Keep a constant transporter lock
on him.

14:54.460 --> 14:58.794
lf Species 8472
attacks Earth...

14:58.864 --> 15:02.061
the Federation won't have
any defenses against them

15:02.167 --> 15:03.828
and l don't need to remind you

15:03.969 --> 15:06.597
that we have no way
to warn Starfleet Command.

15:06.705 --> 15:09.401
Voyager may be the last defense

15:09.475 --> 15:12.342
against an all-out invasion
of Earth.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.283
Last minute preparations?

15:25.357 --> 15:27.382
Just planning my big night out.

15:27.459 --> 15:31.293
l can recommend a nice Japanese
replimat on the Embarcadero.

15:31.363 --> 15:33.797
l was never very good
with chopsticks.

15:33.866 --> 15:35.356
Starfleet Headquarters.

15:35.434 --> 15:36.731
Brings back memories

15:36.835 --> 15:38.894
even if it is
just a re-creation.

15:39.004 --> 15:40.938
l remember my last visit there.

15:41.040 --> 15:44.703
l was given my general orders
for Voyager's first mission--

15:44.777 --> 15:47.712
proceed to the Badlands,
and find the Maquis.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.112
The orders
that brought us together.

15:50.182 --> 15:51.376
What about you?

15:51.450 --> 15:54.283
When was the last time
you were at Headquarters?

15:54.353 --> 15:55.342
Before today?

15:55.421 --> 15:58.083
March 3, 2368--

15:58.157 --> 15:59.886
the day l resigned
my commission.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.757
l can still remember
the look on the Admiral's face.

16:02.861 --> 16:03.953
Which one?

16:03.996 --> 16:05.258
Namimby.

16:05.331 --> 16:07.424
He taught at the Academy,
didn't he?

16:07.499 --> 16:08.523
That's right.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.160
lnterspecies ethics, wasn't it?

16:11.270 --> 16:13.500
Tactical analysis.

16:13.605 --> 16:15.072
Of course.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.577
Kathryn, you think
l might be one of them.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.738
You're testing me.

16:23.782 --> 16:25.875
You and Tuvok were
in the alien habitat

16:25.951 --> 16:27.213
for nearly three hours.

16:27.286 --> 16:29.481
Anything could have
happened down there.

16:29.555 --> 16:30.886
True.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.288
Why don't you have Tuvok
meet us in Sick Bay?

16:33.359 --> 16:35.827
The Doctor can perform
a microcellular analysis.

16:35.894 --> 16:37.691
Tuvok's already there.

16:37.763 --> 16:42.166
You could've just asked me
to report to Sick Bay.

16:42.267 --> 16:44.235
Given Ensign Gentry's reaction,

16:44.336 --> 16:48.238
l thought l'd be
a little more tactful.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.041
You're not taking
any chances, are you?

16:52.111 --> 16:53.135
Don't feel singled out.

16:53.212 --> 16:55.203
l've asked the Doctor
to examine the entire crew.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.679
There's no telling how 8472

16:56.749 --> 16:58.842
got their information
about Starfleet--

16:58.917 --> 17:01.112
from the Borg, Earth.

17:01.186 --> 17:04.178
For all we know, there's
been an impostor on board.

17:06.058 --> 17:07.820
Cell morphology normal.

17:07.960 --> 17:11.828
All of your nucleotide sequences
are accounted for.

17:11.930 --> 17:13.363
You're 100 percent human.

17:13.432 --> 17:15.093
That's a relief.
And Tuvok?

17:15.200 --> 17:17.794
Green-blooded Vulcan
through and through.

17:17.903 --> 17:19.494
Well, two down, 125 to go.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.071
You'd better get going.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.105
Right.

17:22.174 --> 17:23.367
l don't want to be late.

17:23.442 --> 17:24.875
Just be home before midnight.

17:25.010 --> 17:26.477
Yes, ma'am.

17:34.253 --> 17:36.881
l've enhanced this tricorder
with a transoptic datalink.

17:36.955 --> 17:39.082
lt should help you access
some of their systems.

17:39.158 --> 17:42.093
Type-1 phaser, modified
to fire Borg nanoprobes.

17:42.161 --> 17:43.355
Right.

17:43.429 --> 17:46.091
Do you always arm yourself
before a first date?

17:46.165 --> 17:48.497
You've never had a date
with Species 8472.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.900
Personally, l don't go out
with girls from other galaxies.

17:52.037 --> 17:53.902
You're a true explorer,
Chakotay.

17:53.972 --> 17:54.939
ls she cute?

17:55.007 --> 17:56.907
ln her human form, anyway.

17:56.975 --> 17:59.409
l've always wondered what it
would be like to date an alien.

17:59.478 --> 18:00.604
l'll take notes.

18:00.712 --> 18:03.078
We're making our approach.

18:03.115 --> 18:04.207
All stop.

18:04.283 --> 18:05.375
Shields up.

18:10.422 --> 18:11.719
Feisty little fellows.

18:11.790 --> 18:14.816
You've increased their cellular
motility by over 200 percent.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.794
l thought it would be prudent
to maximize their efficiency.

18:17.863 --> 18:19.990
Seven, the last time
we used nanoprobes,

18:20.065 --> 18:22.533
we sent 8472 scurrying
back to fluidic space.

18:22.634 --> 18:24.568
You can't get more
efficient than that.

18:24.636 --> 18:26.467
The species is highly adaptive.

18:26.538 --> 18:28.972
lt's been over a year
since our first encounter.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.872
They may have developed
a defense

18:30.943 --> 18:32.240
against our technology.

18:32.311 --> 18:34.142
There's one way to find out.

18:34.213 --> 18:36.477
We can test the nanoprobes
on our corpse.

18:36.548 --> 18:38.311
You'll find the body
in Morgue Chamber 3.

18:38.383 --> 18:40.146
Beam it to the surgical bay.

18:40.219 --> 18:42.016
The creature's only been dead
for a few hours.

18:42.087 --> 18:44.146
There should still be plenty
of cellular activity.

18:44.223 --> 18:46.987
lnitiate a bio-scan,
full spectrum.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.027
Don't worry.

18:49.094 --> 18:50.254
lt's an autonomic reflex.

18:50.329 --> 18:51.819
The creature still has residual

18:51.897 --> 18:54.092
bio-electric activity
in its nervous system.

18:54.166 --> 18:55.690
Something's wrong.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.735
The nanoprobes should
have taken effect by now.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.168
Hmm.

18:59.238 --> 19:00.136
What is it?

19:00.239 --> 19:02.673
The creature's nucleotides
are still intact.

19:02.741 --> 19:04.709
lt looks like your concerns
were warranted.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.277
We'll have to inform
the Captain.

19:06.378 --> 19:07.811
-We may have to...
-Doctor.

19:07.913 --> 19:09.813
Hmm. False alarm.

19:09.882 --> 19:12.043
l will replicate
more nanoprobes.

19:12.117 --> 19:13.641
l don't mind telling you, Seven,

19:13.719 --> 19:17.155
l'm still holding out
for a diplomatic solution.

19:17.222 --> 19:18.450
lmprobable.

19:18.524 --> 19:21.425
Species 8472 will not
respond to diplomacy.

19:21.493 --> 19:24.087
Funny. We used to say the
same thing about the Borg.

19:24.163 --> 19:28.224
My point is, anything's possible
if you keep an open mind.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.324
Optimism, Seven.

19:29.434 --> 19:31.095
Try to look on the bright side.

19:31.203 --> 19:32.727
lt is difficult to be optimistic

19:32.838 --> 19:34.430
when we are preparing
for battle.

19:34.540 --> 19:35.871
Have you ever heard the phrase

19:36.008 --> 19:37.771
''the best defense
is a good offense''?

19:37.843 --> 19:38.775
No.

19:38.844 --> 19:39.868
Throughout human history,

19:40.012 --> 19:41.570
weapons of mass destruction
were often designed

19:41.647 --> 19:43.615
in the hopes that
they'd never be used.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.547
And yet, in Earth's
third world war,

19:45.617 --> 19:48.711
nuclear weapons accounted
for 600 million casualties.

19:48.787 --> 19:51.312
Were they looking
on the bright side?

19:52.357 --> 19:54.450
An unfortunate exception.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.868
We were just talking about you.

20:13.946 --> 20:14.878
Oh?

20:14.947 --> 20:16.437
She didn't think
you were going to show up.

20:16.515 --> 20:17.914
Boothby!

20:17.983 --> 20:19.177
l've known Archer

20:19.251 --> 20:21.583
since she was
a first-year cadet.

20:21.653 --> 20:23.621
She's not easily impressed.

20:23.689 --> 20:26.055
l didn't think
you were her type.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.128
Oh, uh, if you'll excuse me,

20:30.195 --> 20:34.188
l've got some midnight orchids
that need my attention.

20:34.266 --> 20:36.461
Think about what l said,
young lady.

20:36.568 --> 20:37.728
You'll be fine.

20:37.836 --> 20:38.825
Thank you, Boothby.

20:41.773 --> 20:43.001
Problems?

20:43.075 --> 20:45.168
l was offered a field
commission this morning.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.111
First Officer of
the Starship Hor-CHA.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.306
Congratulations.

20:49.381 --> 20:50.939
lt's a Klingon vessel.

20:51.016 --> 20:53.610
Oh.

20:53.685 --> 20:55.380
So, what did Boothby say?

20:55.454 --> 20:57.945
Du cha mee gagh roch.

20:58.023 --> 21:00.287
''Smile when you eat the gagh. ''

21:01.960 --> 21:03.018
Wise words.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.323
Yeah.

21:04.396 --> 21:06.523
Do you always seek advice
from the groundskeeper?

21:06.598 --> 21:10.056
Half the captains in Starfleet
wouldn't be where they are today

21:10.135 --> 21:11.295
if it weren't for Boothby.

21:11.403 --> 21:15.066
Lopez, Picard, Richardson...
just to name a few.

21:15.173 --> 21:16.800
Closing time.

21:16.908 --> 21:18.341
You offered to be my guide.

21:18.410 --> 21:19.570
Where's our next stop?

21:19.645 --> 21:20.669
Can you dance?

21:20.746 --> 21:22.236
l've been accused of trying.

21:22.314 --> 21:24.646
lt's Pon farr Night
at the Vulcan nightclub.

21:24.716 --> 21:26.411
Vulcan?

21:26.485 --> 21:28.419
lt's just around the corner.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.761
Take it easy, Harry.

21:43.869 --> 21:45.860
We didn't build the Delta Flyer

21:45.971 --> 21:48.337
to withstand
such extensive pacing.

21:48.407 --> 21:50.375
He should have
contacted us by now.

21:50.475 --> 21:51.840
Give him time.

21:51.910 --> 21:53.377
Four hours?

21:53.445 --> 21:54.935
lt's a date.

21:55.013 --> 21:56.674
These things can't be rushed.

21:56.748 --> 21:58.875
They probably
just finished dinner,

21:58.950 --> 22:00.315
a couple of drinks,

22:00.419 --> 22:03.820
and now, they are moving
past the polite stage.

22:03.855 --> 22:06.346
''Polite stage.''

22:06.425 --> 22:07.722
The last 8472 l met

22:07.793 --> 22:10.421
tried to dissolve me
from the inside out.

22:10.495 --> 22:13.293
lt was only trying to get
to know you better, Harry.

22:13.365 --> 22:15.526
You can't fault
a person for that.

22:15.634 --> 22:20.628
Look, Chakotay can
take care of himself

22:20.739 --> 22:22.138
and if he can't,

22:22.207 --> 22:25.267
who better than us
to come to the rescue?

22:33.051 --> 22:34.814
Turns out the transporter
malfunctioned.

22:34.886 --> 22:36.877
My uniform ended up
in the pattern buffer.

22:36.955 --> 22:38.582
You're kidding.
You were naked?

22:38.657 --> 22:39.749
Not entirely.

22:39.825 --> 22:41.258
l had my combadge.

22:41.326 --> 22:43.055
l hope it was well-placed.

22:43.128 --> 22:45.961
Computer, lights.

22:46.098 --> 22:47.258
So this is where

22:47.332 --> 22:50.062
they're putting up
officers nowadays.

22:50.168 --> 22:51.260
Not bad.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.099
Can l get you
something to drink?

22:53.205 --> 22:54.797
Water's fine.

22:54.906 --> 22:57.773
l'm beginning to think
you're a teetotaler.

22:57.843 --> 23:00.175
l like to stay in control.

23:00.245 --> 23:01.507
Always at Yellow Alert, huh?

23:01.580 --> 23:02.911
Something like that.

23:06.318 --> 23:07.580
Find anything interesting?

23:07.652 --> 23:12.680
Beyond the Galactic Edge:
Humanity's Quest for lnfinity.

23:12.758 --> 23:16.023
This is a 21st century edition
of Hesterman, isn't it?

23:16.094 --> 23:18.562
Replicated.
Good book, though.

23:18.630 --> 23:20.530
Never read it.

23:20.599 --> 23:22.590
You should.

23:22.701 --> 23:24.669
Human beings--

23:24.770 --> 23:27.466
they're quite a paradox.

23:27.572 --> 23:30.040
Oh? How so?

23:30.142 --> 23:32.702
At first glance...

23:32.778 --> 23:34.575
they're so primitive--

23:34.646 --> 23:38.742
genetic impurities,
no telepathy, violent--

23:38.817 --> 23:41.650
and yet they've created
so many beautiful ways

23:41.720 --> 23:45.850
to communicate their ideas--
literature, art, music.

23:47.392 --> 23:50.293
At times, l've actually enjoyed
being in this form.

23:51.196 --> 23:52.322
You must think l'm crazy.

23:52.397 --> 23:53.455
Not at all.

23:53.532 --> 23:55.898
l wonder what they think
about us?

23:55.967 --> 23:56.956
Hard to say.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.729
l'll tell you what l think.

23:58.837 --> 24:00.134
They despise us.

24:00.238 --> 24:01.933
They'll attack any species

24:02.007 --> 24:05.374
that's not a part
of their Federation. Mmm.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.968
Speaking of being in human form,

24:07.045 --> 24:10.481
l could use
an isomorphic injection.

24:10.549 --> 24:11.607
You need one?

24:11.683 --> 24:13.378
l'm fine.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.113
Make yourself at home.

25:01.766 --> 25:03.063
Commander.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.605
How do you like the view?

25:11.877 --> 25:13.208
Lovely.

25:13.278 --> 25:15.508
Looks like a full moon.

25:15.580 --> 25:18.378
You can see the entire bay
on a night like this.

25:18.450 --> 25:20.145
l should have brought
my holo-imager.

25:20.218 --> 25:22.379
You make a pretty picture.

25:26.591 --> 25:28.786
Mm, feel that?

25:28.860 --> 25:30.987
Salinated oxygen molecules

25:31.062 --> 25:34.589
stimulating the epidermal
neural receptors.

25:34.666 --> 25:37.362
Non-fluidic space
has its charms.

25:37.469 --> 25:39.266
No argument there.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.497
Planet Earth.

25:40.605 --> 25:43.574
The simulation will be
real soon enough.

25:43.675 --> 25:44.937
How soon do you think?

25:45.043 --> 25:46.635
Weeks, days.

25:46.711 --> 25:49.874
As soon as they think
we're ready.

25:49.948 --> 25:51.677
Can l be honest with you?

25:51.750 --> 25:53.775
Please.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.325
l'm starting to wonder if
all this is worth the effort.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.054
What do you mean?

26:03.128 --> 26:05.460
This simulation, our mission--

26:05.530 --> 26:08.465
are we certain
the humans pose a threat?

26:08.533 --> 26:10.797
They were allies with the Borg.

26:10.902 --> 26:12.631
They invaded our realm.

26:12.737 --> 26:13.965
That was one incident.

26:14.072 --> 26:15.767
Doesn't mean
the entire Federation

26:15.874 --> 26:17.398
is planning a war against us.

26:17.509 --> 26:18.874
We can't trust them.

26:18.977 --> 26:21.275
We have to prepare
for the worst.

26:21.346 --> 26:22.608
l'm not so sure.

26:24.449 --> 26:27.111
l think you've been
human a little too long.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.514
Before you know it,

26:29.588 --> 26:31.886
l'll be sending my résumé
to the real Starfleet.

26:31.990 --> 26:36.893
''Alien from distant
galaxy seeks employment.

26:36.995 --> 26:39.555
References available
upon request.''

26:42.834 --> 26:44.893
Well, it's getting late.

26:45.070 --> 26:46.401
l'd better go.

26:46.471 --> 26:47.438
Already?

26:47.505 --> 26:49.370
l have a tactical report

26:49.441 --> 26:51.432
to finish before morning.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.810
Aren't we forgetting
something?

27:01.920 --> 27:04.252
l'm no expert
at human dating rituals,

27:04.289 --> 27:06.814
but l think it's customary
to kiss good night.

27:08.159 --> 27:09.683
You've never done this before.

27:09.761 --> 27:10.819
Actually...

27:10.929 --> 27:12.521
Me, neither.

27:12.597 --> 27:15.862
Just... think of it as
part of our training.

28:11.723 --> 28:12.815
Report.

28:12.957 --> 28:14.151
l analyzed his DNA.

28:14.225 --> 28:16.125
Your suspicions were correct.

28:16.194 --> 28:17.126
How much does he know?

28:17.195 --> 28:19.129
lt's difficult to say.

28:19.197 --> 28:20.323
He'll have to be interrogated.

28:20.398 --> 28:21.330
Where is he?

28:21.399 --> 28:23.458
By now, he should be
in the main quad.

28:23.568 --> 28:25.468
l recommend we go to daylight.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.663
He'll be easier to track.

28:44.022 --> 28:45.387
Chakotay to Paris.

28:46.558 --> 28:47.923
Delta Flyer, respond!

29:15.720 --> 29:17.244
Yes, come in.

29:18.623 --> 29:21.217
The Borg modifications
are complete.

29:21.292 --> 29:24.523
19 standard photon torpedoes
and three class-10s

29:24.596 --> 29:26.530
armed with high-yield
warheads.

29:26.598 --> 29:27.656
More.

29:27.732 --> 29:29.927
We've depleted our supply
of nanoprobes.

29:30.034 --> 29:31.661
Replicate a new supply.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.362
That is not possible.

29:33.471 --> 29:35.871
Have the Doctor extract them
from your bloodstream,

29:36.007 --> 29:38.271
grow them in a petri dish,
whatever it takes.

29:38.343 --> 29:39.708
lf we do engage 8472,

29:39.778 --> 29:42.269
l don't intend to run out
of firepower mid-battle.

29:42.347 --> 29:44.474
You of all people
should understand that.

29:44.549 --> 29:46.483
They killed what--
four million drones?

29:46.551 --> 29:49.111
Directive 010:

29:49.187 --> 29:51.781
''Before engaging
alien species in battle,

29:51.856 --> 29:54.120
''any and all attempts
to make first contact

29:54.192 --> 29:56.888
and achieve nonmilitary
resolution must be made.''

29:56.961 --> 30:00.158
ln this case, we made first
contact over a year ago

30:00.231 --> 30:02.324
and we barely got
out of it alive.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.800
lt seems to me
a battle is inevitable.

30:04.903 --> 30:06.894
Maybe even war.

30:07.005 --> 30:09.940
So why can't l get that
directive out of my mind?

30:10.041 --> 30:13.909
This species intends
to purge our galaxy of all life.

30:13.978 --> 30:17.539
lt's time you resisted
your Starfleet philosophy.

30:17.615 --> 30:19.480
Captain to the Bridge.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.487
The away team is hailing us.

30:23.555 --> 30:24.886
Tom.

30:24.956 --> 30:26.184
Chakotay's in trouble.

30:26.257 --> 30:27.690
He tried to contact us
ten minutes ago,

30:27.759 --> 30:28.851
but his signal was cut off.

30:28.927 --> 30:30.918
Some kind of force field
went up around the habitat.

30:30.995 --> 30:32.394
We can't get a lock on him.

30:32.463 --> 30:34.192
Has your vessel been detected?

30:34.265 --> 30:35.493
l don't think so.

30:35.567 --> 30:37.797
At least no one's tried
to take a shot at us yet.

30:37.902 --> 30:39.563
Hold your position.
Keep trying to locate him.

30:39.671 --> 30:40.638
We're on our way.

30:40.738 --> 30:41.705
Yes, ma'am.

30:41.806 --> 30:43.774
Bring those Borg weapons
on line.

30:43.875 --> 30:44.864
Red Alert.

30:44.976 --> 30:46.307
All hands to battle stations.

30:46.377 --> 30:47.435
Take us out of orbit.

30:52.383 --> 30:54.544
l thought you had
a tactical report to finish.

30:54.619 --> 30:56.519
What'll you have, son?

30:56.588 --> 30:59.250
l'm a single malt man, myself.

30:59.324 --> 31:00.791
Aged 200 years.

31:00.892 --> 31:03.520
Been saving it
for a special occasion.

31:03.561 --> 31:08.191
And l'd say this
is special enough, mm-hmm.

31:08.266 --> 31:12.202
A toast... to Earth.

31:14.973 --> 31:17.271
Ah.

31:17.342 --> 31:21.836
Chakotay.
Rank: Commander.

31:21.913 --> 31:26.316
Starfleet Service Number:
47-Alpha-6-1-2.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.409
First Officer, USS Voyager.

31:28.486 --> 31:29.953
Species 8472.

31:30.021 --> 31:32.581
Origin: Fluidic space.

31:32.657 --> 31:34.750
Well, now that we've
been formally introduced,

31:34.826 --> 31:36.088
how many ships?

31:37.262 --> 31:38.729
Cat got your tongue?

31:38.796 --> 31:40.229
l asked you a question.

31:40.298 --> 31:43.597
How many vessels do you
have in the Delta Quadrant?

31:43.701 --> 31:46.169
One.

31:47.171 --> 31:48.502
How did you find us?

31:48.573 --> 31:50.097
We detected what looked like

31:50.208 --> 31:52.108
a Federation subspace
transmission.

31:52.176 --> 31:54.007
lt took us weeks
to track it here.

31:54.145 --> 31:55.612
We wanted this simulation

31:55.680 --> 31:57.671
to be accurate
to the last detail.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.217
We obviously went
a little too far.

32:00.285 --> 32:03.152
Now that you know
about our re-creation,

32:03.221 --> 32:06.088
you've no doubt alerted
the Federation.

32:06.157 --> 32:08.352
Your fleet will be on its way.

32:08.426 --> 32:09.518
You've got it wrong.

32:09.594 --> 32:11.619
We're not planning a war
against you.

32:11.696 --> 32:13.493
ls that why you were here
to spy on us--

32:13.564 --> 32:14.622
because you're curious?

32:14.699 --> 32:15.893
Sir?

32:16.067 --> 32:17.329
A starship is approaching.

32:17.435 --> 32:18.663
lt's Voyager.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.135
Raise our shields.

32:20.204 --> 32:21.899
Stand by, all weapons.

32:22.006 --> 32:24.338
Captain Janeway is not here
to launch an attack.

32:24.409 --> 32:25.501
She's here to find me.

32:25.576 --> 32:27.339
We've got the real McCoy here.

32:27.412 --> 32:29.710
We might as well take
advantage of it.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.510
Perform a genetic extraction.

32:31.582 --> 32:35.484
lt may help us find a better way
to maintain these human forms.

32:35.553 --> 32:37.145
Yes, sir.

32:40.558 --> 32:42.685
We're approaching the habitat.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.320
Shields to maximum.
Charge weapons.

32:45.396 --> 32:47.489
All hands, this is the Bridge.
Tactical alert.

32:47.565 --> 32:50.056
Report to your posts and
stand by to engage the enemy.

32:50.168 --> 32:51.499
l have a visual.

32:52.570 --> 32:54.299
We're being scanned.

32:54.405 --> 32:55.838
Let them take a look.

32:55.907 --> 32:58.967
The Delta Flyer is heading
up from the habitat.

32:59.110 --> 33:00.008
Open a channel.

33:00.044 --> 33:01.306
Tom? Status.

33:01.379 --> 33:03.711
They've taken a couple
of potshots at us, Captain.

33:03.781 --> 33:05.840
We've lost our shields.
Mind if we join you?

33:05.917 --> 33:07.680
You're clear to dock.
Shuttle Bay 2.

33:07.752 --> 33:08.844
Any word from Chakotay?

33:08.920 --> 33:10.751
l'm afraid not.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.187
Bring us within range.

33:12.256 --> 33:13.883
Target their weapons array.

33:14.025 --> 33:16.255
Captain, we should target
their power systems as well.

33:16.327 --> 33:17.259
No, l don't want to risk

33:17.328 --> 33:18.386
shutting down
their life support.

33:18.463 --> 33:19.691
lf we can end this
without casualties,

33:19.764 --> 33:20.731
so much the better.

33:20.798 --> 33:22.891
This species does not
deserve our compassion.

33:23.034 --> 33:25.093
You picked a lousy time
for an ethical debate.

33:25.203 --> 33:27.728
The weapons array now.

33:27.839 --> 33:28.999
We're entering range.

33:29.107 --> 33:30.631
3,800 kilometers.

33:30.742 --> 33:31.936
3,500.

33:32.076 --> 33:34.738
3,200.

33:36.848 --> 33:37.815
Valerie.

33:37.882 --> 33:39.509
That's not my name.

33:39.584 --> 33:40.744
Then what is it?

33:45.156 --> 33:46.714
You're afraid of us, aren't you?

33:46.791 --> 33:47.951
You think we're violent.

33:48.059 --> 33:50.289
That we're planning
to destroy your species.

33:50.361 --> 33:52.693
But none of that's true.

33:57.201 --> 33:58.862
lf you would take the time

33:58.970 --> 34:02.201
to speak to us directly,
we could prove it to you.

34:08.146 --> 34:11.013
''There are no secrets except the
secrets that keep themselves.''

34:12.483 --> 34:14.348
Shaw.

34:14.418 --> 34:15.851
George Bernard Shaw.

34:15.920 --> 34:19.879
l saw a copy of his collected
works on your bookshelf.

34:19.956 --> 34:22.790
He had a complex mind...
for a human.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.384
And he had a point.

34:24.462 --> 34:27.659
As long as we keep spying
on each other,

34:27.732 --> 34:29.222
making assumptions,

34:29.300 --> 34:31.563
we probably will go to war.

34:36.373 --> 34:37.636
Voyager.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.213
They're charging weapons.

34:46.284 --> 34:47.342
Do the same.

34:47.418 --> 34:49.386
We're being hailed.

34:51.188 --> 34:52.178
Mr. Boothby.

34:52.255 --> 34:53.416
Captain Janeway.

34:53.491 --> 34:56.119
Good to see you
after all these years.

34:56.194 --> 34:58.128
Enjoying the Delta Quadrant?

34:58.196 --> 35:00.426
Don't get sassy with me,
young lady.

35:00.531 --> 35:02.658
This re-creation
may be Starfleet,

35:02.700 --> 35:05.464
but our weapons are
far more sophisticated.

35:05.570 --> 35:08.698
l can destroy your vessel
with a single command.

35:08.806 --> 35:10.296
Run along, now.

35:10.408 --> 35:11.773
l'm not going anywhere.

35:11.843 --> 35:14.038
Not until you return
my First Officer

35:14.112 --> 35:16.171
and give me a damn
good explanation

35:16.247 --> 35:18.408
for what you're doing
in our galaxy.

35:18.483 --> 35:22.044
l've targeted your re-creation

35:22.120 --> 35:24.315
with Borg nanoprobes.

35:24.388 --> 35:26.982
And we're willing to use them
if you force us to.

35:27.058 --> 35:28.423
Don't try to rattle my cage.

35:28.493 --> 35:30.984
l'll disable your tactical
systems before you...

35:31.062 --> 35:32.996
The last time
our species engaged in battle,

35:33.064 --> 35:34.429
you suffered heavy casualties.

35:34.499 --> 35:37.491
Are you willing to take
that chance again?

35:39.570 --> 35:41.094
An armed conflict

35:41.205 --> 35:44.299
isn't going to solve
our problems.

35:44.408 --> 35:46.808
We could go on making threats.

35:46.878 --> 35:48.641
Spying on each other.

35:48.713 --> 35:52.444
Risking a war
between our species.

35:52.517 --> 35:54.747
Or we could try
a more direct approach.

35:54.819 --> 35:57.083
What do you have in mind?

35:57.155 --> 35:59.851
How about a class reunion?

36:06.264 --> 36:07.526
Targ manure!

36:07.598 --> 36:09.293
United Federation of Planets...

36:09.367 --> 36:11.232
tolerance for all species...

36:11.335 --> 36:13.098
the Prime Directive...

36:13.204 --> 36:15.138
targ manure,
every word of it.

36:15.206 --> 36:18.437
Your metaphor is colorful,
but inaccurate.

36:18.509 --> 36:19.476
Vulcan logic...

36:19.544 --> 36:21.637
add that to the list.

36:21.712 --> 36:23.680
Obviously, you've studied
a Starfleet database.

36:23.748 --> 36:26.717
You must've learned something
about our history.

36:26.784 --> 36:28.843
We adhere to our directives.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.854
High-minded ideals
are one thing,

36:30.922 --> 36:33.720
but your actions tell
a very different story.

36:33.791 --> 36:36.316
You infiltrated
our re-creation,

36:36.394 --> 36:38.589
captured and killed
one of our people.

36:38.663 --> 36:40.631
l told you he took his own life.

36:40.698 --> 36:44.156
You created biological weapons
to infect our species.

36:44.235 --> 36:46.294
You are allies with the Borg.

36:46.404 --> 36:47.462
No.

36:47.572 --> 36:48.800
There's a drone sitting

36:48.906 --> 36:50.271
at this very table.

36:50.341 --> 36:52.832
Look at her-- all gussied up
to look like a human being.

36:52.944 --> 36:55.242
l am no longer part
of the collective.

36:55.313 --> 36:57.679
Once a Borg, always a Borg.

36:57.748 --> 37:00.012
Seven of Nine is
a member of this crew.

37:00.084 --> 37:01.745
The Borg are irrelevant.

37:01.819 --> 37:03.514
lt's the humans
that pose a threat.

37:03.588 --> 37:06.614
They think the Federation
is a hostile invasion force

37:06.691 --> 37:08.386
out to destroy their species.

37:08.459 --> 37:09.824
l see.

37:09.961 --> 37:13.624
So you're planning a preemptive
strike against Earth.

37:13.698 --> 37:14.926
Maybe l am.

37:14.999 --> 37:17.092
You realize
l can't let that happen.

37:17.201 --> 37:19.135
Go ahead.
Fire your damn nanoprobes,

37:19.203 --> 37:21.262
blow our re-creation
to high heavens.

37:21.372 --> 37:22.930
There are a dozen more

37:23.040 --> 37:24.871
scattered throughout
the Quadrant.

37:24.976 --> 37:26.807
You'll never find them all.

37:26.877 --> 37:28.504
What if l told you

37:28.579 --> 37:31.446
that Starfleet
isn't planning an invasion,

37:31.515 --> 37:34.245
that no one on Earth
has even heard of you?

37:34.318 --> 37:35.808
l'd say you're lying.

37:35.886 --> 37:38.650
Have another look at that
Federation database of yours.

37:38.723 --> 37:40.884
You'll see there's no mention
of your realm.

37:40.992 --> 37:42.425
lmmaterial.

37:42.493 --> 37:44.154
Any information
regarding our species

37:44.228 --> 37:45.889
has no doubt been classified
by Starfleet lntelligence.

37:45.963 --> 37:47.294
has no doubt been classified
by Starfleet lntelligence.

37:47.365 --> 37:48.798
Good point.

37:48.866 --> 37:49.798
You know, we could

37:49.867 --> 37:51.767
keep this paranoid
debate going all day.

37:51.869 --> 37:53.427
You have no reason to trust us,

37:53.537 --> 37:55.437
and we have no reason
to trust you.

37:55.506 --> 37:58.532
Hear, hear. l knew this reunion
would be a fiasco.

37:58.643 --> 37:59.735
Admiral...

37:59.810 --> 38:00.868
Seven...

38:00.978 --> 38:02.377
disarm the warheads.

38:02.446 --> 38:03.538
Captain?

38:03.614 --> 38:05.081
Do it.

38:11.555 --> 38:13.386
What are you trying
to prove, young lady?

38:13.457 --> 38:15.823
One of us has to take
our finger off the trigger.

38:15.893 --> 38:17.053
lt might as well be me.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.331
Their weapons are off-line.

38:23.401 --> 38:25.232
lt's a trick.

38:25.336 --> 38:26.268
Our defenses are down.

38:26.337 --> 38:27.531
What will you do now?

38:27.638 --> 38:31.165
Blow Voyager to high heavens
or do we keep talking?

38:31.275 --> 38:34.210
Humans... you've got a
flair for the dramatic,

38:34.278 --> 38:35.711
l'll give you that.

38:35.780 --> 38:37.213
You want to keep talking?

38:37.281 --> 38:40.876
Fine by me, but no more
beating around the bush.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.612
Now what do you want from us?

38:42.687 --> 38:43.779
The truth, Captain.

38:44.889 --> 38:47.357
Voyager is alone
in the Delta Quadrant.

38:47.425 --> 38:51.293
We haven't been in contact
with Earth for over four years.

38:51.362 --> 38:53.853
Explain why you attacked
our realm,

38:53.931 --> 38:55.660
hand in hand with the Borg.

38:55.733 --> 38:56.893
At the time, we didn't realize

38:57.034 --> 38:59.594
the Borg had started
the war against you.

38:59.704 --> 39:02.264
We forged a temporary
alliance with them

39:02.373 --> 39:04.364
because we thought
you were the threat.

39:04.475 --> 39:06.739
''Your galaxy will be purged.''

39:06.811 --> 39:08.244
Sound familiar?

39:08.312 --> 39:10.473
We were only trying
to defend ourselves.

39:10.548 --> 39:13.745
lf that's true,
why are you still in our galaxy?

39:13.818 --> 39:16.616
Your conflict with the Borg
ended over a year ago.

39:16.687 --> 39:19.747
Why re-create Starfleet,
masquerade as humans?

39:19.824 --> 39:23.726
lt looks to me like you're
the ones planning an invasion.

39:23.794 --> 39:24.818
The truth.

39:24.962 --> 39:25.826
Don't answer her.

39:25.963 --> 39:27.396
She's manipulating us.

39:27.465 --> 39:30.229
lf you won't answer, l will.

39:30.334 --> 39:31.232
Commander!

39:31.335 --> 39:33.235
Our mission is to infiltrate
your homeworld,

39:33.304 --> 39:34.328
to place operatives

39:34.438 --> 39:35.996
in the highest levels
of Starfleet,

39:36.107 --> 39:38.541
monitor your military
installations.

39:38.609 --> 39:41.134
lt's a reconnaissance mission,
nothing more.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.305
We should listen to her,
Captain.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.872
They're being driven by fear
just like we are...

39:45.950 --> 39:47.645
unless everything
you said on our date

39:47.718 --> 39:48.844
was just part of an act.

39:48.919 --> 39:49.681
lt wasn't.

39:49.754 --> 39:50.880
Enough!

39:50.955 --> 39:53.549
We must not negotiate
with these creatures.

39:53.624 --> 39:54.852
Sit down, Admiral.

39:54.925 --> 39:55.983
Sir?

39:56.060 --> 39:57.322
l said sit down

39:57.395 --> 39:59.454
or l'll knock you
right on your human butt.

39:59.530 --> 40:02.658
You've been seduced by them,
both of you.

40:02.733 --> 40:05.395
l've had a chance
to see through human eyes

40:05.503 --> 40:07.562
and l'm beginning to wonder...

40:07.671 --> 40:09.571
are they really so violent?

40:09.640 --> 40:11.198
What if we're wrong?

40:11.308 --> 40:13.276
We can't risk trusting them.

40:13.344 --> 40:15.209
You'd rather risk another war?

40:16.847 --> 40:18.246
Keep talking, son.

40:18.315 --> 40:19.577
Archer's right.

40:19.650 --> 40:21.083
We've got to set aside

40:21.152 --> 40:23.177
our preconceptions
about each other.

40:23.254 --> 40:25.449
Granted, our species didn't meet

40:25.523 --> 40:26.581
under the best
of circumstances,

40:26.657 --> 40:29.421
but maybe we can
make first contact again.

40:29.493 --> 40:31.427
Maybe this time,
we'll get it right.

40:31.495 --> 40:33.520
You believe in this fellow?

40:33.597 --> 40:36.191
Yes.

40:36.300 --> 40:38.928
There would have to be
a few ground rules.

40:39.036 --> 40:40.731
Name them.

40:40.838 --> 40:43.568
First off, l want to take a look
at that nanoprobe technology.

40:43.641 --> 40:45.131
lt scares the hell out of me.

40:45.242 --> 40:46.834
All right...

40:46.911 --> 40:50.005
but l'll need some tactical
information in return--

40:50.147 --> 40:53.116
your genetic alteration
techniques for a start.

40:53.184 --> 40:54.742
l'm sure something
can be arranged.

40:54.819 --> 40:56.150
You on board, Admiral?

40:57.888 --> 41:00.015
Good enough for me.

41:07.164 --> 41:10.622
Captain's Log,
Stardate 52136.4.

41:10.701 --> 41:12.999
We've managed to avoid
a military conflict

41:13.103 --> 41:16.436
with Species 8472...
at least for now.

41:16.507 --> 41:18.441
ln an effort
to strengthen the truce,

41:18.509 --> 41:20.272
we're exchanging technology.

41:20.344 --> 41:21.470
The design schematics

41:21.545 --> 41:23.843
for our nanoprobe
weapons, as requested.

41:23.914 --> 41:26.678
This could go a long way
toward allaying their fears.

41:26.750 --> 41:27.944
Perhaps.

41:28.085 --> 41:29.677
Have a little faith, Seven.

41:29.753 --> 41:31.550
lt's difficult
to have faith in an idea

41:31.622 --> 41:33.180
which may prove
tactically unsound.

41:33.257 --> 41:34.519
Tactically unsound?
Perhaps.

41:34.592 --> 41:36.651
lt could also be the
first step toward peace.

41:36.727 --> 41:38.160
lt's a risk l'm willing to take.

41:38.229 --> 41:39.628
Are you sure you won't join us?

41:39.697 --> 41:41.688
lt would be your first
chance to see Earth.

41:41.765 --> 41:43.528
l prefer to remain
aboard Voyager.

41:43.634 --> 41:46.194
lf problems arise
while you're in the habitat...

41:46.303 --> 41:47.702
There won't be any problems--

41:47.771 --> 41:49.170
nothing tactical at any rate.

41:49.240 --> 41:50.969
We're entering
a stage of diplomacy

41:51.041 --> 41:53.202
where most of the problems
will be cultural.

41:53.277 --> 41:55.006
How do you shake
hands with an 8472?

41:55.145 --> 41:56.669
We'll be fine.

41:56.747 --> 41:58.681
When you ordered me
to disarm the warheads

41:58.749 --> 41:59.841
during the negotiation,

41:59.917 --> 42:01.680
l anticipated
an immediate attack.

42:01.785 --> 42:03.480
l believed they
would take advantage

42:03.521 --> 42:04.647
of your human weakness.

42:04.722 --> 42:06.553
l was wrong.

42:06.624 --> 42:10.822
lf l had been in your position,
we would most likely be engaged

42:10.895 --> 42:13.227
in a battle with 8472
at this moment.

42:13.297 --> 42:14.787
How did you know?

42:14.865 --> 42:15.797
l didn't.

42:15.866 --> 42:17.663
Like l said...

42:17.768 --> 42:18.860
Faith.

42:21.205 --> 42:25.141
Welcome to Terrasphere 8,
Starfleet Command Re-creation.

42:25.242 --> 42:26.766
l am Admiral Bullock

42:26.877 --> 42:29.937
and l'll be acquainting you
with our facility.

42:30.080 --> 42:32.173
Questions, comments--
bring them to me.

42:32.249 --> 42:35.514
Problems--
talk to Lieutenant Kinis.

42:36.554 --> 42:39.216
Commander Tuvok,
you wanted to examine

42:39.290 --> 42:40.552
our thermionic generators.

42:40.624 --> 42:41.716
Yes.

42:41.792 --> 42:44.192
l'll take you there personally.

42:44.261 --> 42:45.888
Ambassador Nellix.

42:45.963 --> 42:47.954
lt's Neelix, sir.

42:48.065 --> 42:49.327
Neelix.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.095
You'll be joining
the Lieutenant.

42:51.201 --> 42:52.566
He'll familiarize you

42:52.670 --> 42:55.537
with our environmental
control technology.

42:55.606 --> 42:57.836
Wonderful.
l look forward to hearing

42:57.908 --> 42:59.637
your perspective on Vulcans.

42:59.710 --> 43:01.268
You didn't happen to re-create

43:01.378 --> 43:03.903
a little coffee shop
on Market Street, the Night Owl?

43:04.014 --> 43:05.845
Afraid not.

43:05.916 --> 43:08.009
You're welcome to stay;
put your feet up.

43:08.085 --> 43:10.280
We won't be returning
to fluidic space

43:10.354 --> 43:11.548
for another day or two.

43:11.622 --> 43:14.182
Thank you, but the real Earth
is a long way from here.

43:14.258 --> 43:15.885
l'd like to get
back on the road.

43:15.960 --> 43:17.484
What are the chances
they'll listen to you?

43:17.561 --> 43:19.392
l can't promise you
the moon, Captain.

43:19.463 --> 43:22.432
My superiors aren't
as forward-thinking.

43:22.499 --> 43:24.899
Peace with humans?

43:25.069 --> 43:27.765
Wow... they're going
to hit the roof,

43:27.871 --> 43:29.896
but l'll tell them
what happened here today,

43:30.007 --> 43:31.440
and with a pinch of luck,

43:31.508 --> 43:33.806
a few of them
might see the light.

43:33.877 --> 43:35.708
Well, you've got Voyager's
com frequency.

43:35.779 --> 43:36.871
You know how to contact us.

43:36.947 --> 43:39.177
l hope we can keep
this process alive.

43:39.249 --> 43:42.241
Don't call us, we'll call you.

43:42.319 --> 43:43.911
Oh, l almost forgot.

43:43.988 --> 43:45.717
Ah...

43:48.926 --> 43:51.861
Genetically synthesized...

43:51.929 --> 43:54.762
but they smell just as lovely.

43:54.832 --> 43:56.265
Oh...

44:03.340 --> 44:05.831
Looking forward to going home?

44:06.010 --> 44:09.275
At least l can finally
get out of this form.

44:09.346 --> 44:10.779
No more insomnia.

44:10.848 --> 44:12.873
No more sleeping, period.

44:13.017 --> 44:16.384
For what it's worth,
you made a terrific human.

44:16.453 --> 44:18.648
Shame...

44:18.722 --> 44:19.984
Hmm?

44:20.057 --> 44:22.184
lt's too bad our species
are so different.

44:22.259 --> 44:24.284
Otherwise, l'd ask
you for a second date.

44:24.361 --> 44:26.226
You did offer to be my guide.

44:26.296 --> 44:28.594
How about a tour
of your realm sometime?

44:28.666 --> 44:30.566
l'd like that.

44:30.668 --> 44:33.501
Well...

44:33.570 --> 44:35.561
l'm due back on Voyager.

44:35.673 --> 44:37.470
We leave at 0400.

44:40.744 --> 44:44.202
l'll never get a chance
to do this again.

44:55.025 --> 44:57.323
Any better this time?

44:58.362 --> 45:00.125
You're a quick study.
