00:01.502 --> 00:03.754
<i>Previously on</i> Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.088 --> 00:05.631
I've been inside your brain.

00:06.090 --> 00:09.051
<i>I know what you want, or rather whom.</i>

00:09.510 --> 00:12.763
Our May Life-Model Decoy
should get us the Darkhold.

00:12.972 --> 00:14.348
And if something goes wrong...

00:14.765 --> 00:16.225
<i>then we have a second LMD.</i>

00:17.059 --> 00:18.519
I still care about you, Fitz.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.980
I've got to hand it to you Radcliffe.
You certainly act like it.

00:21.647 --> 00:22.898
Looks like you have a problem.

00:23.149 --> 00:25.192
I said I needed your protection.
Now you can see why.

00:25.401 --> 00:26.569
You'll have to meet the Superior.

00:27.069 --> 00:28.070
Whatever it takes.

00:38.497 --> 00:40.624
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.335
I've got a bad feeling about this.

00:44.253 --> 00:47.256
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.

00:47.423 --> 00:49.592
Curse my metal body!
I wasn't fast enough!

00:49.884 --> 00:52.053
Help me, Obi-Wan.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.146
God.

01:02.354 --> 01:03.439
I think I'm gonna stick with the...

01:03.856 --> 01:06.901
"one foot in front of the other"
method of self-propulsion.

01:07.109 --> 01:09.570
Just relax. Keep practicing.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.655
- I'll go get us another round.
- Yeah, fine.

01:26.337 --> 01:27.963
Who's your zombie-killing daddy now?

01:28.339 --> 01:29.298
Bam.

01:45.564 --> 01:47.441
Sam to Billy, Sam to Billy!

01:49.360 --> 01:50.528
There's nowhere to go!

01:50.694 --> 01:52.238
Surrender, and you will not be harmed!

01:59.870 --> 02:01.622
I'll give you to the count of three!

02:01.956 --> 02:03.666
One, two...

02:21.809 --> 02:22.852
Throw him in!

02:24.687 --> 02:25.563
Let's go!

02:32.820 --> 02:34.446
Agent Coulson, this is Agent Koenig.

02:34.613 --> 02:38.159
They've got Agent Koenig.
I repeat, they've got Agent Koenig!

02:46.417 --> 02:47.918
- Which one?
- Billy.

02:48.127 --> 02:49.336
He was abducted an hour ago.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.422
Any possible motive?

02:51.672 --> 02:52.548
He has the Darkhold.

02:52.715 --> 02:54.967
I gave it to him because he knows
how to make things disappear.

02:55.134 --> 02:57.845
And now someone's made him disappear.
Can't be a coincidence.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.763
May's the only one
who would know I gave it to Billy,

02:59.889 --> 03:01.640
so I think we know where
to point the finger.

03:02.558 --> 03:03.642
- Radcliffe.
- He's been desperate

03:03.726 --> 03:05.227
to get his hands on that book,

03:05.311 --> 03:08.314
and he's had eyes and ears on this base
for God knows how long.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.442
But still...
kidnapping a Koenig?

03:12.109 --> 03:13.319
That's like catching moonlight.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.904
We can't even find them half the time.

03:15.154 --> 03:17.031
If Radcliffe has aligned himself
with Nadeer,

03:17.448 --> 03:18.908
they'd have the resources
to find him.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.535
Why would he join forces
with public Inhuman hater number one?

03:21.660 --> 03:22.745
He has nothing against us.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.413
She's got to be a means to an end.

03:24.580 --> 03:26.248
He needs access and protection.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.542
- Davis?
- They picked up Agent Koenig.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.294
His Quinjet will be docking shortly.

03:30.461 --> 03:32.463
Hopefully, Sam will have
some more information for us.

03:32.755 --> 03:33.881
If we can find who took Billy,

03:34.089 --> 03:35.925
we may be able to connect them
back to Nadeer.

03:36.050 --> 03:38.135
- And Radcliffe?
- Fitz is working on it.

03:41.305 --> 03:43.432
I'm not going to let this
come between us.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.102
What's the occasional bullet
in the head among friends?

03:47.645 --> 03:48.479
Done.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.107
Now talk. Where's Radcliffe?

03:52.816 --> 03:54.193
I'm right in front of you, and...

03:55.819 --> 03:57.446
you've paralysed me
from the neck down.

03:57.655 --> 03:58.530
Hey.

04:00.115 --> 04:01.033
Where is he?

04:01.909 --> 04:02.826
Sorry, Fitz.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.330
You don't get to shoot first
and ask questions later.

04:08.249 --> 04:09.833
We'll shoot whenever we damn please.

04:10.084 --> 04:12.336
And this time, nobody's gonna
put you back together again.

04:13.671 --> 04:16.839
What I meant is I don't precisely know
where I...

04:17.632 --> 04:21.887
where Dr Radcliffe currently is
at this precise moment.

04:22.471 --> 04:24.306
I could be out for a walk
or getting groceries.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.516
That's enough.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.519
Hey, hey, I need his CPU in one piece,
not scattered all over the lab.

04:29.228 --> 04:30.688
I'm not trying to be difficult.

04:31.355 --> 04:32.898
You need to understand.

04:34.566 --> 04:35.651
I'm the victim.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.028
Things are not as they seem.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.381
You two will want to get acquainted.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.259
You're the last one
the other's gonna see alive.

05:01.010 --> 05:03.387
- Yeah, well, we're ready to die.
- No!

05:03.512 --> 05:06.307
No. No, no, no, no.
I'm extremely not ready to die.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.851
Cut off my fingers, eat my liver,
it doesn't matter.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.602
Nothing you do
is gonna make me talk.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.480
You must've sustained some brain damage
during your last torture.

05:13.939 --> 05:14.940
That...

05:15.649 --> 05:16.692
wasn't torture.

05:23.032 --> 05:24.074
That was a greeting.

05:27.870 --> 05:28.871
Now...

05:30.164 --> 05:32.124
the one who comes in this room next...

05:34.877 --> 05:35.961
won't be me.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.550
The man who comes in here
will do things to you...

05:43.552 --> 05:45.137
that I can't even watch.

05:46.555 --> 05:47.681
He will break you.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.519
Yeah, well, Koenigs don't break.

05:52.978 --> 05:55.898
All right? We're programmed to take pain,
so bring it on!

05:56.523 --> 05:57.566
Bring it on!

05:59.151 --> 06:01.445
Oh, my God. I'm in so much pain.
I don't think I can take this.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.155
That guy hits really hard.

06:03.447 --> 06:05.491
Do you have any, uh, any, like,
cyanide or...

06:05.616 --> 06:08.285
- Cyanide? Why would I...
- Or, like, a paper bag.

06:08.452 --> 06:10.954
You put it over my head,
you suffocate me really quick.

06:11.288 --> 06:14.291
- This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.
- Who are you?

06:14.917 --> 06:16.126
Dr Holden Radcliffe.

06:16.668 --> 06:17.836
I work for S.H.I.E.L.D. too.

06:18.504 --> 06:20.172
I'm afraid I'm the reason you're here.

06:21.924 --> 06:23.592
I told them Coulson gave you the book.

06:23.926 --> 06:26.345
- The boo-- What book?
- The Darkhold.

06:28.597 --> 06:31.183
My friend, I made some questionable
allegiances to get hold of it,

06:31.600 --> 06:33.018
and they double-crossed me, that's...

06:34.186 --> 06:36.021
that's why we're here, wherever here is.

06:47.866 --> 06:51.286
- Agent Koenig, welcome aboard.
- Agent Coulson, Agent May.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.415
Agent Quake.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.708
- Yeah.
- What's the latest, Sam?

06:56.834 --> 06:57.751
Any sign of Billy?

06:58.127 --> 07:00.921
Well, I found the Humvee
at the end of a dock, but...

07:01.088 --> 07:03.215
- No one there.
- No, they either evaporated

07:03.340 --> 07:04.675
or dove into the sea.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.269
My intent was... was purely scientific.

07:15.436 --> 07:17.980
But, oh! The things I saw...

07:18.355 --> 07:20.524
It was expanding my brain
and my reality...

07:20.774 --> 07:21.942
You're getting all Gollumy again.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.652
Well, that's... that's what
the Darkhold does to you,

07:23.777 --> 07:24.653
it drives you mad.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.949
Yeah, maybe you should tell them
where the book is.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.200
Let it drive them mad.

08:06.236 --> 08:09.364
I am the captain of this ship,
and you are my prisoners.

08:10.115 --> 08:13.619
If you cooperate, you will be treated
as welcomed guests.

08:15.204 --> 08:17.706
If not, you will be removed...

08:18.832 --> 08:19.750
piece...

08:21.126 --> 08:22.002
by piece.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.546
That won't be necessary.

09:09.591 --> 09:10.634
Vodka.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.471
Perfectly chilled, pure.

09:15.264 --> 09:17.432
The onion enhances the experience.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.434
But people forget the old ways.

09:20.269 --> 09:22.813
Now they'll put flavours in it, vanilla.

09:24.481 --> 09:25.649
The old ways are better.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.527
Simple, built to last.

09:29.194 --> 09:30.404
Like this submarine.

09:32.614 --> 09:33.699
Modern machines.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.285
All software, less hardware.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.662
You put too much faith in them.

09:38.996 --> 09:40.998
Man is the superior machine.

09:44.668 --> 09:45.586
And I...

09:47.504 --> 09:49.047
am the superior man.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.643
I'm told you refuse to talk...

10:03.103 --> 10:04.396
and that you welcome pain.

10:05.314 --> 10:06.356
I, too, love pain.

10:09.526 --> 10:12.279
And I love to make others feel it...

10:13.155 --> 10:14.740
using the old ways.

10:16.033 --> 10:18.702
All right, stop! Enough.

10:20.370 --> 10:21.288
Enough!

10:22.372 --> 10:24.124
Senator Nadeer promised me

10:24.458 --> 10:26.043
he wouldn't be permanently damaged.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.128
She's not the captain of this ship.

10:28.754 --> 10:30.088
Yes, I understand.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.507
But he isn't going to talk.

10:34.468 --> 10:35.677
What do you suggest, Doc?

10:41.308 --> 10:42.643
Let me get inside his head.

10:48.857 --> 10:51.610
This is a complete
and unacceptable invasion of my privacy.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.862
Well, since you refuse to cooperate,

10:53.987 --> 10:56.948
Fitz is going to reprogram you
to sing like a canary.

10:57.783 --> 10:58.825
That seems odd.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.870
Singing I can understand perhaps,
but singing like a bird?

11:02.287 --> 11:03.664
Why not Mick Jagger?

11:05.082 --> 11:06.041
Whoa.

11:06.958 --> 11:07.876
What is that?

11:08.585 --> 11:10.796
That's nothing like Aida's code.
That's nothing like anything.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.967
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.471
This code is advanced.
It's like fifth-generation syntax.

11:19.638 --> 11:20.847
I've never seen anything like it.

11:22.265 --> 11:25.060
Every time I keep trying to alter it,
it kicks me right back to the...

11:25.227 --> 11:27.604
<i>Amicitiae nostrae memoriam</i>

11:28.063 --> 11:30.691
<i>spero sempiternam fore.</i>

11:31.274 --> 11:32.234
Uh. Fitz...

11:32.734 --> 11:35.529
<i>Vir sapit qui pauca loquitur.</i>

11:35.821 --> 11:37.572
<i>Alea iacta est.</i>

11:44.830 --> 11:47.124
The only thing worse
than a robot is a possessed one.

11:47.416 --> 11:49.668
I agree. That was no fun.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.461
Where's Daisy when we need her?

11:51.795 --> 11:53.380
Who developed the code? Huh?

11:54.005 --> 11:55.090
Who programmed you?

11:55.924 --> 11:57.718
Was it Radcliffe? Aida?

12:07.978 --> 12:09.938
I can't see their faces.
They're both Russian?

12:10.230 --> 12:11.773
<i>Da, da,</i> I'm lucky to be alive.

12:12.149 --> 12:15.318
I love Billy, but he is not a fighter.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.779
He ran. He left me there to handle it.

12:18.363 --> 12:19.281
No, that's...

12:20.031 --> 12:20.949
That's Billy.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.869
That's him kicking ass and that's you,
hiding behind the bar.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.288
No, I... I think you got us

12:26.621 --> 12:28.665
I think you got us flipped there.

12:28.957 --> 12:29.833
I mean, you're...

12:30.667 --> 12:32.627
You're literally wearing
the same thing right now.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.881
We have no idea what Billy did
with the Darkhold.

12:36.006 --> 12:36.798
I didn't want to know.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.467
That was the whole point
in giving it to him.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.177
Well, we need to get it back
and destroy it.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.179
- If you'd given it to me...
- And they'd have you now.

12:42.679 --> 12:45.390
I wanted to protect you, and the Koenigs
have dealt with this kind of thing before.

12:45.557 --> 12:46.808
You don't need to protect me, Phil.

12:47.058 --> 12:50.145
I know. But I've lost
too much lately. I'm not gonna lose you.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.273
Both the guys who tried
to assassinate the Director

12:53.440 --> 12:55.025
were Russian, this has to be connected.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.777
Maybe there's, like,
a <i>Red Dawn</i> thing happening,

12:56.860 --> 12:58.278
but what does it have to do with Billy?

12:58.361 --> 13:00.614
They don't want Billy.
They want something I entrusted to him.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.157
Did... What...

13:03.325 --> 13:05.827
Is it... smaller than a Quinjet?

13:06.161 --> 13:09.206
That's classified. And yes, considerably.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.999
Okay, we have face.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.210
Hello, Russian bad guy.

13:14.169 --> 13:16.755
Okay. Run facial recognition.
See if we come up with a lead.

13:16.922 --> 13:17.923
Copy.

13:23.678 --> 13:27.015
I don't care what this is or what
you guys do, I'm not gonna talk.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.142
You won't have to.
That's the beauty of it.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.853
This machine will allow me
access to his mind.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.105
We'll get all the information we need
without laying a hand on him.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.066
Well, you're not gonna get
anything out of me.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.653
Because my mind is a steel trap
inside of a sealed box

13:40.278 --> 13:41.613
surrounded by quicksand, and...

13:42.113 --> 13:43.323
Oh, is that a puppy?

13:43.824 --> 13:46.076
We've given him a sedative scenario
to keep him relaxed

13:46.201 --> 13:47.994
while we map his cerebral matter.

13:48.537 --> 13:50.914
That'll allow me to have
a look around inside his mind.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.166
This book better be worth it.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.211
If you want to get rid of the Inhumans,
the answer will be in it.

13:58.088 --> 13:59.339
And what's in it for you?

14:01.675 --> 14:02.592
A better world.

14:03.593 --> 14:04.928
Then we want the same thing.

14:11.226 --> 14:12.394
You're staring at me.

14:13.228 --> 14:16.314
I'm sorry. I just... I can't believe
I'm sitting here with Quake!

14:16.523 --> 14:17.440
You know, this is...

14:17.941 --> 14:19.192
Oh, somebody pinch me.

14:19.651 --> 14:22.946
Sam, stop. We've known each other
for three years.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.283
Yeah, I knew Skye,
but you're... you're Quake.

14:26.616 --> 14:27.534
She's different.

14:27.868 --> 14:31.788
No, she's not and she doesn't love
the name Quake.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.499
But... you're a superhero!

14:34.916 --> 14:36.001
I mean that's so awesome!

14:36.459 --> 14:37.794
Did you know that online

14:38.086 --> 14:40.463
there's a library
of fan fiction about Quake?

14:40.797 --> 14:41.882
Did not need to know that.

14:42.257 --> 14:43.717
Oh, well, you should Google it.

14:44.175 --> 14:46.011
Because it's... it's...

14:46.219 --> 14:47.345
Actually, no, you shouldn't.

14:47.679 --> 14:48.930
You shouldn't. Forget I said that.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.433
Some of it is a little
on the steamier side.

14:51.933 --> 14:52.851
Not that I've read it!

14:53.101 --> 14:54.561
But you hear things.

14:54.728 --> 14:58.273
Wow. I mean, they got you shipping
with Black Widow.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.025
Some of the drawings are...

15:01.026 --> 15:02.277
They... they call you Quack.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.615
Good timing. We have a match.

15:07.449 --> 15:10.827
Leo Babikov. Ex-SVR, Special Ops...

15:11.620 --> 15:14.039
The same Special Ops division the two men
who tried to assassinate

15:14.205 --> 15:15.123
the Director were in.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.875
- And there's our link to Nadeer.
- Get this.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.419
They all have ties
to Prime Minister Olshenko.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.380
The Russian Prime Minister
who was attacked by an Inhuman.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.257
And then threw Bobbi and Hunter
under the bus

15:24.341 --> 15:26.134
after they saved his life. This is bad.

15:26.468 --> 15:31.097
We got Nadeer, international Watchdogs,
and Russian spies all united because...

15:31.264 --> 15:32.349
Because they hate Inhumans.

15:32.474 --> 15:34.142
Yeah, that's why they want
the Darkhold.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.730
'Cause it'll show them
how to wipe out the Inhumans.

15:39.314 --> 15:40.649
You knew Billy had the Darkhold?

15:40.774 --> 15:43.610
Well, yeah, I couldn't say anything
with all the redshirts hanging around.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.779
Do you know what he did with it?

15:46.446 --> 15:48.156
It is secure.

15:50.325 --> 15:52.077
I'd like to help you, but honestly...

15:53.203 --> 15:54.663
I have some trust issues.

15:55.246 --> 15:58.083
Trust? You betrayed me.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.834
Fitz, it's not Radcliffe.

15:59.918 --> 16:02.003
Yeah, I know it's not!
But he thinks like he does.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.130
Betrayed me, betrayed S.H.I.E.L.D.,

16:04.297 --> 16:06.675
he made me lie to you, and he made me
think he was my friend.

16:07.550 --> 16:08.593
Just to use me.

16:09.928 --> 16:12.597
- You were like a son to me.
- Oh, shut up. Just...

16:13.848 --> 16:14.766
Shut up.

16:16.893 --> 16:19.270
- What's this really about?
- He said shut up.

16:19.521 --> 16:21.856
- You can do it the easy way...
- Why don't you just turn him off?

16:22.148 --> 16:23.858
He needs to be powered on
to access his programming,

16:23.942 --> 16:25.443
not that it matters.
I'm not getting anywhere.

16:27.487 --> 16:30.740
We all have programming.
It may be more obvious in my case,

16:31.282 --> 16:33.451
but what is a human if not a function
of programming?

16:33.618 --> 16:37.080
You've been programmed by betrayal,
abandonment...

16:37.622 --> 16:39.332
Ward, who you thought
was your friend,

16:39.499 --> 16:42.210
Daisy who left you all, your father.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.796
He's just trying to distract you.

16:46.423 --> 16:47.424
Let's step away.

16:51.136 --> 16:52.387
It's not him, it's me.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.808
I can't do it. It's way beyond me.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.977
That's your father talking.

17:01.271 --> 17:02.814
Isn't that what he used to say to you?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.567
Not enough, not smart enough?

17:09.738 --> 17:10.780
Why would you say that?

17:12.031 --> 17:13.032
Because I knew him.

17:19.164 --> 17:22.791
I wanted to tell you, but I was afraid
it would open old wounds.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.295
That's not possible.

17:26.421 --> 17:27.797
Glasgow isn't that big, Fitz.

17:28.590 --> 17:31.885
Your father and I were classmates,
St. Mungo's at Eastwood.

17:32.093 --> 17:33.803
- Fitz, it's lying.
- No.

17:34.804 --> 17:37.515
How would he...
how would Radcliffe know those things?

17:37.807 --> 17:41.311
Maybe he had access to your files.
This is a... a firewall.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.897
It's playing mind games,
trying to distract you,

17:43.980 --> 17:46.357
- because it knows you'll crack the code.
- No, I won't!

17:47.108 --> 17:48.276
He knows it, so do you.

17:48.860 --> 17:49.736
That's not true.

17:50.111 --> 17:51.863
Actually, your exact quote was...

17:52.363 --> 17:54.032
"Where's Daisy when we need her?"

17:54.115 --> 17:55.325
That's not what I meant.

17:55.909 --> 17:58.620
Let's wipe its memory, give it to Mack.
We'll find Radcliffe another way.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.914
- I like that plan.
- We weren't friends,

18:01.289 --> 18:03.958
but we'd take the same train
to the city for work.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.002
Sometimes we sat together.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.839
One time, he showed me
a picture of his new son, Leopold.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.008
He was so proud.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.303
I swear I'm telling the truth, Fitz.

18:16.012 --> 18:16.971
I can prove it.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.182
I saw him a few months ago.

18:20.475 --> 18:21.643
He said I was to tell you...

18:37.575 --> 18:39.577
- How long does this take?
- Not much longer.

18:40.912 --> 18:41.871
Please be patient.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.667
While we're waiting,
perhaps you could tell me

18:45.834 --> 18:47.377
why you dislike the Inhumans so much.

18:48.336 --> 18:52.006
Yes, some of them
are monsters, true, but...

18:52.173 --> 18:53.133
These Inhumans...

18:54.801 --> 18:57.720
they did not suffer,
labour to become what they are.

18:58.429 --> 18:59.514
They have great power...

19:00.723 --> 19:01.808
but they didn't earn it.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.811
They are unnatural things.

19:07.188 --> 19:08.189
We will destroy them...

19:09.983 --> 19:12.068
and then the thing
that brought them upon us.

19:13.570 --> 19:14.487
And what was that?

19:15.071 --> 19:16.948
Cerebral cortex mapping is complete.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.450
You may now enter his memories.

19:21.244 --> 19:22.787
One thing at a time, Doctor.

19:29.752 --> 19:30.628
What?

19:30.879 --> 19:32.881
Where's my puppy? Who took my puppy?

19:33.381 --> 19:34.674
Take him to the brig.

19:48.271 --> 19:49.230
All right.

19:49.731 --> 19:50.690
Here we go.

19:53.151 --> 19:55.195
Take me to the Darkhold, Agent Koenig.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.491
<i>He's making something.</i>

20:01.201 --> 20:02.118
I see wires...

20:03.161 --> 20:06.206
<i>Oh, God, he's building a bomb
to destroy the Darkhold.</i>

20:09.250 --> 20:10.335
Never mind. False alarm.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.504
<i>You can't underestimate Radcliffe.</i>

20:13.713 --> 20:15.840
We have to assume he's gonna get
the information out of Billy.

20:16.090 --> 20:16.966
Impossible.

20:17.091 --> 20:19.427
- How can you be so sure?
- He doesn't know where it is.

20:19.802 --> 20:20.887
He gave it to me.

20:21.429 --> 20:22.305
This isn't right.

20:23.139 --> 20:24.974
<i>I'm in his head, but I'm also seeing him.</i>

20:26.309 --> 20:27.435
<i>Doesn't make sense, unless...</i>

20:30.271 --> 20:31.189
He doesn't have it.

20:33.107 --> 20:35.026
You sent us after the wrong man?

20:35.360 --> 20:37.278
No, he had it,
but he gave it to someone

20:37.445 --> 20:39.822
who looks just like him... a brother or...

20:41.574 --> 20:42.617
or a replica.

20:45.370 --> 20:46.496
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

20:46.621 --> 20:47.914
You just said Billy gave it to you.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.374
- He did.
- You forgot where you hid it?

20:49.457 --> 20:51.334
- No, I didn't hide it. No.
- So you still have it?

20:51.417 --> 20:54.170
- Then what did you do with it?
- I gave it to Agent Koenig.

20:54.295 --> 20:55.546
- You gave it back to Billy?
- Negative.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.006
- Then who?
- L.T.

20:57.131 --> 20:59.008
- Who's L.T.?
- Special Agent L.T. Koenig.

20:59.217 --> 21:01.344
- There's another one?
- No, not just another one.

21:02.178 --> 21:05.932
The first one.
L.T. got us all into S.H.I.E.L.D.

21:06.641 --> 21:07.850
We have to pick up L.T.

21:08.518 --> 21:10.228
I don't think any Koenig
is safe right now.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.148
How's Fitz doing?

21:15.400 --> 21:17.235
That Rad-Bot was really getting
under his skin.

21:17.527 --> 21:20.488
Oh, he'll be fine. He just needs
some space at the moment.

21:23.032 --> 21:25.660
What was all that about,
uh... his father?

21:26.244 --> 21:27.620
Fitz never mentioned him before.

21:28.288 --> 21:29.414
He was not a good man.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.709
Always telling Fitz
he was stupid and worthless.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.003
I think that's why Fitz became so clever.

21:37.005 --> 21:38.673
I'd like to have a few words
with that man.

21:39.257 --> 21:40.967
You and me both.

21:42.343 --> 21:44.262
But he walked out on them
when Fitz was ten.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.639
He hasn't seen
or heard from him since.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.142
So, you're telling me
with all the tools and tech

21:49.267 --> 21:51.644
that S.H.I.E.L.D. has at its disposal,
we can't find him?

21:51.894 --> 21:52.770
We could.

21:54.314 --> 21:55.481
But Fitz doesn't want to.

21:59.861 --> 22:00.820
<i>You guys got anything?</i>

22:01.029 --> 22:03.406
<i>This club's L.T. Koenig's
last known location.</i>

22:03.656 --> 22:06.743
Negative. Just a lot of man-buns.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.996
<i>And one crazy ass handlebar moustache.</i>

22:13.541 --> 22:14.542
Got your green tea.

22:15.626 --> 22:17.003
- Thank you.
- Any news?

22:17.837 --> 22:18.713
Nothing yet.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.049
I hope we're not too late.

22:21.466 --> 22:24.302
Those Koenigs are tough but they've been
through enough already.

22:24.552 --> 22:26.471
We all have. That's the game.

22:27.680 --> 22:28.890
I guess we should be grateful.

22:29.557 --> 22:31.976
After all the years, all the missions,

22:32.310 --> 22:33.603
all the close calls...

22:33.895 --> 22:35.271
- Both our deaths.
- Right.

22:35.938 --> 22:38.191
After all that, we're still standing,
the two of us.

22:39.734 --> 22:40.860
Maybe we should toast to that.

22:48.785 --> 22:51.621
We've been, uh...
making a lot of toasts lately.

22:53.373 --> 22:54.999
Maybe we should try something else.

23:01.964 --> 23:03.925
Guys, I think you need to get in here.

23:05.510 --> 23:06.552
On our way.

23:12.183 --> 23:14.602
<i>Welcome to the inside of my mind, Sheeple.</i>

23:14.894 --> 23:17.897
<i>You guys watching any, uh,
any good programming lately?</i>

23:18.106 --> 23:19.565
<i>You know why they call it
"programming," right?</i>

23:20.566 --> 23:23.861
<i>Because you're being programmed
through little screens,</i>

23:23.986 --> 23:26.489
<i>big screens, little morphine drips</i>

23:26.697 --> 23:29.992
<i>of sequels and prequels
and zombies and Kanyes,</i>

23:30.201 --> 23:32.245
<i>Snapchats and Grumpy Cats,</i>

23:32.620 --> 23:37.041
<i>all designed by the media,
corporate S.H.I.E.L.D. machine,</i>

23:37.542 --> 23:40.711
<i>and you're asleep,
binge-watching the apocalypse!</i>

23:41.129 --> 23:42.588
<i>You know what Tony Stark's armour...</i>

23:42.839 --> 23:45.299
Jeez. Did these guys
come off an assembly line?

23:45.883 --> 23:47.260
Outside. Now.

23:50.638 --> 23:53.182
- Who are you? Why are you here?
- Drop your weapon.

23:53.808 --> 23:54.684
Stand down!

23:55.893 --> 23:58.438
Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?
You're ruining my set!

23:58.563 --> 23:59.730
You were doing that all by yourself.

24:00.273 --> 24:02.024
It's all right. We're with S.H.I.E.L.D.

24:02.150 --> 24:05.695
No! You can't be in here!
This is a Peace Palace.

24:06.070 --> 24:07.071
Hey, hey, hey.

24:07.488 --> 24:08.406
Ho, ho.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.241
S.H.I.E.L.D. storm troopers
have got to go.

24:10.450 --> 24:11.993
Hey...

24:14.120 --> 24:16.622
- Coulson, what are you doing here?
- Sam sent us.

24:16.873 --> 24:18.749
Billy's in trouble, and you could be
in danger too.

24:19.167 --> 24:20.042
And who's this one?

24:20.460 --> 24:24.213
That's Thurston. He's an idiot,
and, unfortunately, my brother.

24:25.882 --> 24:26.966
Agent L.T. Koenig.

24:27.842 --> 24:29.677
Sorry about kicking your candy ass.

24:35.141 --> 24:39.604
You iced me! She iced me,
and now I'm aboard your war bird!

24:39.770 --> 24:41.606
Stop being a whiny little bitch.

24:41.731 --> 24:43.900
We brought you here
for your own protection.

24:44.066 --> 24:46.152
My own protec...
I don't want your protection.

24:46.277 --> 24:48.654
I don't want anything to do
with your Agents of Doom.

24:48.863 --> 24:49.947
What happened to you?

24:50.114 --> 24:53.409
We had the same parents,
same teachers, same liquor cabinet.

24:53.868 --> 24:56.329
Your brothers toughened up,
joined the cause...

24:56.537 --> 24:59.749
Yeah, that worked out great for Eric.
He'd be alive if it wasn't for you!

24:59.874 --> 25:02.335
Eric died so good people
could live and do good things!

25:02.585 --> 25:04.003
What good have you done
for the world?

25:04.170 --> 25:05.755
Okay, okay, guys, guys, hey.

25:05.963 --> 25:08.966
We're family, okay? Okay?
Eric wouldn't have wanted this.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.720
So let's bring it in
for a little Koenig Krush.

25:13.095 --> 25:15.264
Here you go.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.016
Oh, God!

25:17.475 --> 25:19.602
- What was that for?
- You let your guard down.

25:19.936 --> 25:21.938
- Didn't I teach you anything?
- We were having a moment.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.482
It was nice. Grow 'em back now.
It's time to work.

25:24.690 --> 25:25.942
Can I go home?

25:26.651 --> 25:29.445
Sorry, Thurston. We can't let you leave
till we know what's going on.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.656
These gentlemen
will take you to your room.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.783
If you need anything, just let them know.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.207
I think I have a lead on Billy.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.210
Okay, so after they left the SVR,

25:44.377 --> 25:47.046
our Russian bad boys were
employed as security officers

25:47.255 --> 25:49.340
for a weapons-manufacturing
firm linked to...

25:50.174 --> 25:53.219
this guy, Anton Ivanov,
a reclusive industrialist

25:53.386 --> 25:54.637
with interests all over the globe.

25:54.762 --> 25:56.138
Could be the source of Nadeer's financing.

25:56.389 --> 25:58.724
He's also an avid collector
of military antiques,

25:58.808 --> 26:02.478
- so guns, tanks, and... a submarine.
- Bingo.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.398
Throw everything you have at it.
We find him, we find Billy,

26:05.565 --> 26:08.526
- maybe a way to bring down Nadeer.
- At least we know the Darkhold's safe.

26:09.110 --> 26:09.986
Right, L.T.?

26:11.279 --> 26:12.530
That's the bad news.

26:12.822 --> 26:13.906
I gave it to Billy.

26:14.282 --> 26:15.324
- What?
- What?

26:15.992 --> 26:17.827
<i>It was Operation Hot Potato.</i>

26:18.035 --> 26:20.162
<i>Pass it back and forth,
keep it moving.</i>

26:20.580 --> 26:24.542
<i>Billy was the last to have it,
so my guess is he put it in the Labyrinth.</i>

26:24.834 --> 26:26.002
<i>What's the Labyrinth?</i>

26:26.669 --> 26:29.922
- It's a top-secret S.H.I.E.L.D. vault.
- Only the Koenigs know its location.

26:30.423 --> 26:32.842
We need to get there before they get
the information out of Billy.

26:35.845 --> 26:38.681
Now we're getting somewhere.
Aida, remember these numbers...

26:38.848 --> 26:41.350
7-4-6-3-8.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.821
<i>8-1-2.</i>

26:59.201 --> 27:02.288
9-4-5-7-3.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.460
1 -0-1 -6-8.

27:12.256 --> 27:13.299
9-9-4-3-8.

27:22.683 --> 27:23.559
Got it.

27:24.310 --> 27:27.396
- Now turn this boat around.
- I give the orders on this ship.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.441
Your tone sounds threatening.

27:41.661 --> 27:43.579
Now, let's not lose our heads.

27:44.538 --> 27:46.082
What seems to be the problem here?

27:46.749 --> 27:49.210
You put too much faith in machines.

27:49.377 --> 27:52.838
I'm going to go get the information
out of him my way.

27:53.422 --> 27:55.424
If it's the same, then we go.

27:55.633 --> 27:57.551
Absolutely not. I won't allow it.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.428
Get them out of here.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.407
You brought an Inhuman on my ship?

28:21.200 --> 28:22.451
She's a machine.

28:24.161 --> 28:25.079
Aida, release him.

28:30.418 --> 28:32.920
You... made her?

28:33.921 --> 28:35.297
With my own hands.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.675
Simple, built to last.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.845
Now turn this boat around.

28:41.971 --> 28:42.888
Please?

28:56.485 --> 28:58.904
I keep telling myself I don't care
if Radcliffe knows my father,

28:59.029 --> 28:59.989
I'm over it, but...

29:01.407 --> 29:02.324
maybe I'm not.

29:05.536 --> 29:06.787
Maybe I'm stuck in a loop.

29:07.997 --> 29:08.956
Radcliffe...

29:10.499 --> 29:11.542
Ward...

29:12.418 --> 29:13.294
my dad...

29:16.380 --> 29:18.048
they're all the same, it keeps happening.

29:19.675 --> 29:20.676
I don't see it that way.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.137
Come on, Jemma.

29:24.180 --> 29:25.181
You know that it's true.

29:26.682 --> 29:27.808
Yes, they betrayed you.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.102
And after everything you've been through,

29:30.352 --> 29:33.189
no one would blame you
if you put up your own firewall.

29:34.607 --> 29:35.483
But you didn't.

29:36.942 --> 29:38.569
Instead, you became the most...

29:39.320 --> 29:42.239
open, loyal, caring person I've ever met.

29:43.449 --> 29:44.658
Maybe that's why it keeps happening.

29:45.075 --> 29:46.911
It's why I fell in love with you.

29:47.703 --> 29:49.705
Who you really are,
that's not programming.

29:50.831 --> 29:52.208
It's something way beyond that.

29:57.546 --> 29:58.506
That's it.

29:59.548 --> 30:00.424
Jemma...

30:04.178 --> 30:05.095
you're the best.

30:12.645 --> 30:14.188
Just you and me now, Tin Man.

30:15.439 --> 30:17.358
You don't mess with my buddy
and walk away from it.

30:18.359 --> 30:19.860
If you shoot me now, it'll be murder.

30:20.528 --> 30:22.154
Nice try, wrong guy.

30:23.447 --> 30:26.784
You're just a bunch of ones and zeroes,
not flesh and blood.

30:27.576 --> 30:28.494
Flesh and blood?

30:29.036 --> 30:31.622
That's not life, Mack,
that's just biology and biology is just...

30:32.998 --> 30:35.417
- software programming you to die.
- Maybe.

30:36.752 --> 30:40.089
But I have something you will never have:
a soul...

30:40.714 --> 30:42.383
that will continue long after I'm gone.

30:43.425 --> 30:45.511
How can you be so sure
I don't have one?

30:46.762 --> 30:49.557
If a soul doesn't come from your flesh
and blood or my ones and zeroes,

30:49.682 --> 30:51.684
then it has to come from somewhere else,

30:51.851 --> 30:54.061
somewhere unrelated
to our physical bodies.

30:54.770 --> 30:56.272
If you can have one, so can I.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.109
You are a sly one, aren't you?

31:01.902 --> 31:04.738
If you don't think I'm alive
and don't have a soul...

31:06.657 --> 31:09.159
then why did you feel the need
to switch me on before killing me?

31:10.911 --> 31:13.581
- I like to hear robots scream.
- Mack! Stop!

31:14.039 --> 31:14.957
Wait.

31:16.876 --> 31:18.335
I know a way around his programming.

31:24.466 --> 31:26.969
If you don't stop,
you're gonna cause irreparable damage.

31:27.595 --> 31:29.096
You'll never learn what your father said.

31:29.763 --> 31:32.266
Don't care. I'm out of that loop.

31:32.683 --> 31:35.144
- You want to tell me what's going on?
- Something Jemma said.

31:36.270 --> 31:37.646
We're more than our programming.

31:39.064 --> 31:41.150
- There's something else.
- All right, look.

31:41.859 --> 31:44.695
I give up. I'm ready to talk.
What do you need to know?

31:45.112 --> 31:47.197
He couldn't crack the code
because it wasn't a code.

31:47.489 --> 31:48.824
It's just a bunch of gibberish.

31:49.158 --> 31:52.202
So, what's running him?
You telling me thing is alive?

31:52.536 --> 31:55.247
- Fitz, please. Stop.
- No, of course not.

31:56.874 --> 31:57.958
All I'm saying is...

32:07.009 --> 32:08.010
it has a brain.

32:12.598 --> 32:16.518
L.T., stay with Quake and Agent May.
Agent Coulson, come with me.

32:18.938 --> 32:19.980
I'm going with them.

32:28.322 --> 32:30.324
So, what was it like,
growing up with four of them?

32:30.991 --> 32:32.117
There was a lot of crying.

32:32.368 --> 32:34.119
- They picked on you?
- I picked on them.

32:34.620 --> 32:35.496
It was fun.

32:36.080 --> 32:39.333
The laundry was disgusting.
Enough DNA to make a clone army.

32:49.426 --> 32:50.344
Okay.

32:50.928 --> 32:52.554
Wait here. I'll be right back.

33:00.854 --> 33:03.315
So... read any good books lately?

33:05.192 --> 33:07.945
Imagine how big our brains would be
if we had time to read them all.

33:14.493 --> 33:18.455
It's made of light, but it's functioning
like a corporeal, biological brain.

33:18.914 --> 33:22.418
Quantum energy storing data,
it's as if synapses are interacting.

33:22.835 --> 33:24.420
- Is that possible?
- No.

33:25.587 --> 33:27.214
No, not even in the slightest.

33:27.798 --> 33:29.174
I wish I could take credit,

33:29.800 --> 33:31.510
but this was all Aida and the Darkhold.

33:32.052 --> 33:35.014
Everything in the original brains,
memories, knowledge, desires

33:35.389 --> 33:37.099
is contained in the quantum brains.

33:37.391 --> 33:39.184
- So, you see, I re--
- You said "brains."

33:41.562 --> 33:43.439
My God. Is it possible?

33:46.025 --> 33:47.276
What? Talk to me.

33:48.235 --> 33:51.238
- Radcliffe mapped another brain.
- I saw it. I watched him do it.

33:51.363 --> 33:52.406
You can't be serious.

33:54.533 --> 33:55.534
It was May.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.043
I never read <i>Ulysses.</i>

34:04.877 --> 34:09.505
I always wanted to take a month off,
go to Ireland, read it in pubs.

34:11.175 --> 34:12.092
Someday.

34:13.177 --> 34:14.511
Maybe we should go together.

34:20.601 --> 34:21.476
Yeah?

34:25.272 --> 34:26.190
It's a little nerdy.

34:28.650 --> 34:29.860
Did you mean it when you said...

34:30.610 --> 34:32.237
you're ready for whatever comes next?

34:44.123 --> 34:45.333
We've got company!

34:48.962 --> 34:50.422
Hey, what's... what's going on?

34:50.797 --> 34:53.132
Three men, armed,
heading our way, and they've got Billy.

34:53.300 --> 34:55.135
All right. Take this. We'll handle it.

34:57.387 --> 34:58.806
Here. Give it to me.

34:59.973 --> 35:01.266
No need for you to be the target.

35:03.977 --> 35:04.895
May?

35:07.898 --> 35:09.108
What's going on? Give it to me.

35:13.821 --> 35:14.696
I can't.

35:18.951 --> 35:20.327
What are you doing, May?
Put the gun down.

35:20.869 --> 35:22.955
I'm sorry, Coulson. I can't.

35:23.580 --> 35:25.207
This is the right thing to do.

35:26.333 --> 35:28.377
Leave me alone and I'll take care of it.

35:28.961 --> 35:31.130
Destroy it, yeah. That's the plan.

35:32.005 --> 35:33.841
Now lower your damn weapon
and give me the Darkhold!

35:34.007 --> 35:34.883
I can't!

35:38.595 --> 35:39.972
'Cause it's not in your programming.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.308
- What are you talking about?
- You're not May.

35:43.767 --> 35:44.768
Why would you say that?

35:45.727 --> 35:47.396
Because there's some things
you can't fake.

35:48.689 --> 35:49.982
He switched you, didn't he?

35:51.400 --> 35:52.484
How long have you been...

35:55.988 --> 35:58.240
So, this is what Radcliffe
programmed you to do?

35:59.741 --> 36:03.495
I didn't know what my mission was
until I had my hands on it.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.540
- Where's the real May?
- I am the real May.

36:07.958 --> 36:11.003
Her thoughts, her memories,
her desires...

36:12.337 --> 36:13.338
that's all real.

36:13.881 --> 36:15.174
May would never betray me.

36:16.925 --> 36:18.302
Radcliffe made some adjustments.

36:25.475 --> 36:26.643
So, May's a freakin' robot.

36:27.477 --> 36:28.937
- How did you know?
- Fitz and Simmons...

36:36.445 --> 36:37.321
Go.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.409
No!

36:43.744 --> 36:44.661
No!

36:49.082 --> 36:51.919
Give us the book,
I'll give you your brother.

36:52.461 --> 36:54.087
My brother? What, are you kidding?

36:54.254 --> 36:56.173
I've never seen this guy
before in my life.

36:56.924 --> 36:57.841
You want the book?

36:59.968 --> 37:01.053
Let him go.

37:11.313 --> 37:12.648
What did they do to you, man?

37:13.857 --> 37:15.234
They took my puppy.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.237
Hey. You're gonna be okay, little brother.

37:31.583 --> 37:32.501
So cool.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.336
Grab Billy and let's get to the Quinjet.

37:34.628 --> 37:36.296
No!

37:58.944 --> 38:00.445
Help!

38:01.905 --> 38:03.240
May! What...

38:03.740 --> 38:05.784
What happened? Let me help you. Okay.

38:14.209 --> 38:15.460
Hello, Agent May.

38:17.713 --> 38:18.755
Mission accomplished.

38:22.384 --> 38:25.053
This is exactly
what you were supposed to do.

38:25.929 --> 38:27.222
I'm eternally grateful.

38:29.683 --> 38:30.600
Take me with you.

38:33.020 --> 38:33.895
Please.

38:34.896 --> 38:35.772
Sorry.

38:36.648 --> 38:37.649
You weren't built to last.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.451
The Labyrinth is compromised.

38:47.784 --> 38:50.370
The deadliest tome in the world
is in the hands of a mad scientist,

38:50.620 --> 38:52.914
who snuck out the back door
with cattle-prod man.

38:53.582 --> 38:55.542
I'm... sorry we let you down.

38:55.917 --> 38:57.878
We now have the name
of the man who kidnapped you,

38:58.128 --> 39:00.922
who's probably been funding Nadeer,
maybe even Radcliffe.

39:01.298 --> 39:02.883
Now we can hunt them and stop them.

39:03.342 --> 39:07.596
I st... I still can't believe he made
a fully functioning autonomous LMD.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.139
Yeah, put us to shame.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.975
Sam and Billy were part
of the original LMD programme.

39:12.392 --> 39:15.896
- Wait. Are you saying they're...
- Obsolete. Without a doubt.

39:16.772 --> 39:19.524
- So, you all are...
- Technicians.

39:20.317 --> 39:22.277
What? You thought they were robots?

39:23.278 --> 39:24.237
Uh...

39:28.283 --> 39:31.495
Billy. Thank God you're okay.

39:32.704 --> 39:33.830
All right.

39:34.456 --> 39:36.375
You're still a sheep, though.
You're all sheep!

39:37.501 --> 39:39.920
Well, the Quinjet's ready when you are.
We'll get you home safely.

39:40.170 --> 39:42.089
As always, thank you for your service.

39:42.339 --> 39:43.465
Any time, Coulson.

39:55.644 --> 39:56.895
I hope this is the last of them.

39:57.729 --> 39:58.897
There's still one more.

39:59.898 --> 40:01.441
He couldn't destroy it. Not yet.

40:02.609 --> 40:03.985
If we can't find the real May, then...

40:06.488 --> 40:07.739
that's all that's left of her.

40:16.915 --> 40:17.874
Hey.

40:20.961 --> 40:21.920
We'll find her.

40:22.796 --> 40:23.713
I promise.

40:37.602 --> 40:40.730
To our success,
though a narrow escape for both of you.

40:52.075 --> 40:53.034
It is better.

40:55.245 --> 40:56.705
The old ways always are.

40:57.539 --> 40:59.416
You said you wanted
to destroy the Inhumans

40:59.541 --> 41:02.294
and the thing
that brought them upon us.

41:02.919 --> 41:05.005
It's something I've been after
for a very long time.

41:06.214 --> 41:07.549
Some people say it's an obsession.

41:08.467 --> 41:09.551
I can relate.

41:11.511 --> 41:13.555
Every time something strange
happens in the world,

41:14.097 --> 41:15.015
it is there.

41:15.474 --> 41:17.225
I believe it is responsible

41:17.309 --> 41:19.561
for all of the alien problems
on this planet.

41:20.729 --> 41:23.523
The Chitauri, the Kree, Inhumans.

41:24.232 --> 41:25.108
What is it?

41:30.238 --> 41:31.156
A man.

41:35.243 --> 41:36.495
He is always there...

41:37.871 --> 41:40.207
standing behind, out of focus...

41:41.917 --> 41:43.043
in the shadows.

41:43.585 --> 41:44.628
He is dead...

41:45.754 --> 41:47.297
yet he is everywhere.

41:48.131 --> 41:50.467
And Mr Shockley said
he was there last night.

41:51.134 --> 41:52.177
I can assure you...

41:54.012 --> 41:54.930
he's not dead.

41:56.139 --> 41:57.349
You can help me get to him?

42:04.940 --> 42:05.941
So...

42:06.900 --> 42:07.984
let it be written.
