01:05.416 --> 01:07.291
I love Captain Dog
so much!

01:07.291 --> 01:08.833
(dogs exclaiming)

01:08.833 --> 01:11.875
Oh, no! Doctor Stretcho
has the Bark Knight trapped

01:11.875 --> 01:14.583
in his super stretchy grip.

01:14.583 --> 01:17.208
(cackling)

01:17.208 --> 01:18.291
(grunts)

01:18.291 --> 01:21.833
There's only one dog
who can save us now.

01:24.583 --> 01:26.291
(together)
Did somebody holler

01:26.291 --> 01:28.083
for a hero in a collar?

01:30.250 --> 01:33.250
Perhaps you can stop me,
Captain Dog,

01:33.250 --> 01:36.375
but even a super pooch
is no match for my...

01:36.375 --> 01:38.583
flying saucer!

01:38.583 --> 01:40.708
(laughing):
Flying saucer!

01:40.708 --> 01:42.625
(whirring)

01:47.000 --> 01:48.125
(gasps)

01:48.125 --> 01:49.416
Not a flying saucer!

01:49.416 --> 01:51.583
Flying saucers
are so scary.

01:52.583 --> 01:53.875
Don't worry, Rolly.

01:53.875 --> 01:56.625
Captain Dog isn't afraid
of flying saucers.

01:59.875 --> 02:01.583
(train horn blows)

02:01.583 --> 02:03.333
Ahhh!

02:03.333 --> 02:05.250
Barksville's monorail
is gonna fall

02:05.250 --> 02:06.416
through the broken bridge!

02:06.416 --> 02:07.500
I can't watch!

02:07.500 --> 02:09.250
I-I can, but I can't.

02:09.250 --> 02:12.833
Oh, you know Captain Dog
always saves the day.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.875
(brakes screeching)

02:23.333 --> 02:26.208
Now you're on
the right track.

02:27.416 --> 02:29.000
(growls, barks)

02:32.083 --> 02:33.500
I wish I was Captain Dog.

02:33.500 --> 02:36.458
He's so brave,
and he can fly!

02:36.458 --> 02:37.458
Ugh!

02:37.458 --> 02:38.708
(laughs)

02:38.708 --> 02:39.750
(Bob chuckles)

02:39.750 --> 02:41.875
I know you two
love Captain Dog

02:41.875 --> 02:43.291
as much as I do,

02:43.291 --> 02:45.083
so, I got us tickets

02:45.083 --> 02:47.958
to Captain-Dog-apalooza
today!

02:47.958 --> 02:50.333
It's a big party
for people and pets

02:50.333 --> 02:51.875
who love Captain Dog!

02:51.875 --> 02:54.500
-I love parties!
-I love Captain Dog.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.458
(barking)

02:56.458 --> 02:57.583
Eh. Let me know when

02:57.583 --> 03:00.583
a Crystal Rainbow Princess Cat
party comes to town.

03:00.583 --> 03:03.333
I also have a surprise
I can't wait to show you two

03:03.333 --> 03:04.375
once we get there.

03:04.375 --> 03:07.083
A Captain Dog party
and a surprise?

03:07.083 --> 03:08.333
What are we waiting for?

03:11.375 --> 03:13.000
(chuckling)

03:13.000 --> 03:14.416
Bow to the wow, Bingo!

03:14.416 --> 03:16.291
You look just like
the Bark Knight.

03:16.291 --> 03:17.416
And you look
exactly like--

03:17.416 --> 03:19.083
Captain Dog?

03:19.083 --> 03:20.583
Is it really you?

03:20.583 --> 03:22.708
That costume
is perfect!

03:22.708 --> 03:24.166
You hear that, Rolly?

03:24.166 --> 03:27.458
Who's Rolly?
I'm Captain Dog!

03:27.458 --> 03:29.458
(laughs)
Okay...

03:29.458 --> 03:30.708
Captain Dog.

03:30.708 --> 03:33.083
Check it out!
My costume's got the official

03:33.083 --> 03:35.458
Captain Dog
outer space dog tag,

03:35.458 --> 03:37.250
his retractable red cape,

03:37.250 --> 03:39.083
utility collar, and...

03:39.083 --> 03:41.583
I've even loaded
two Captain Dog
Courageous Crunchies

03:41.583 --> 03:43.166
into my collar.

03:43.166 --> 03:44.625
Bob:
Check it out, guys.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.250
All the pet owners here

03:46.250 --> 03:48.458
built this recreation
of Barksville.

03:48.458 --> 03:50.708
Whoa! Be careful, Stephen.

03:50.708 --> 03:53.375
You don't want
to accidentally
hit anything.

03:53.375 --> 03:55.291
It's a puppy-sized
play area

03:55.291 --> 03:57.708
of the city where
Captain Dog lives.

03:57.708 --> 03:59.708
And you guys get to
play around in it.

03:59.708 --> 04:01.458
Just like Captain Dog!

04:01.458 --> 04:05.125
And now for the surprise
I was telling you about.

04:05.125 --> 04:07.708
One of the coolest things
about this Barksville

04:07.708 --> 04:10.083
is that I made
the monorail myself.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.416
-Bow wow!
-Bow wow!

04:11.416 --> 04:13.458
Just finished it this morning.

04:13.458 --> 04:15.458
Rolly:
It's a teeny tiny Bob.

04:15.458 --> 04:17.416
With a teeny tiny
monorail.

04:17.416 --> 04:18.583
There's even a contest

04:18.583 --> 04:21.583
for whoever built
the best part of the city.

04:21.583 --> 04:23.875
I really hope I win
that blue ribbon.

04:23.875 --> 04:26.458
(barking)

04:26.458 --> 04:28.208
Look at that.

04:28.208 --> 04:30.375
-(monorail horn toots)
-It works great!

04:30.375 --> 04:32.125
Okay, pup heroes,

04:32.125 --> 04:34.500
have fun while I check out
the gift shop,

04:34.500 --> 04:37.083
and make sure to protect
my monorail.

04:37.083 --> 04:39.416
Oh, I hope I can win
that contest.

04:39.416 --> 04:41.416
Did you hear that, Rolly?

04:41.416 --> 04:44.333
Rolly? Who's Rolly?
Remember?

04:44.333 --> 04:46.583
I'm... Captain Dog!

04:46.583 --> 04:49.458
Right. Did you hear that,
Captain Dog?

04:49.458 --> 04:52.583
Bob needs us to protect
his super amazing monorail.

04:52.583 --> 04:55.333
-That sounds like a mission.
-You bet it is.

04:55.333 --> 04:58.583
This place looks exactly
like Barksville does on TV.

04:58.583 --> 05:00.333
And it's a good thing
Bob asked

05:00.333 --> 05:01.750
to have it protected by...

05:01.750 --> 05:04.500
Captain Dog
and the Bark Knight.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.458
Let's just hope nothing
out of the ordinary happens

05:06.458 --> 05:07.500
while he's gone.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.458
-(crash)
-Whoa!

05:10.416 --> 05:11.875
I-I can't see anything!

05:11.875 --> 05:13.375
(dogs exclaiming)

05:14.583 --> 05:16.833
(barks) Whoa!

05:16.833 --> 05:18.125
Bingo, look!

05:18.125 --> 05:20.750
I'd recognize that stretchy
supervillain anywhere.

05:20.750 --> 05:23.291
That stretchy supervillain
is heading this way!

05:23.291 --> 05:26.125
And if he's not careful,
he's gonna run into...

05:26.125 --> 05:28.000
-Bob's monorail!
-...Bob's monorail!

05:28.000 --> 05:29.583
All right, Captain Dog,

05:29.583 --> 05:31.125
we have to steer him
in another direction

05:31.125 --> 05:33.333
and protect
Bob's monorail!

05:33.333 --> 05:35.458
Doctor Stretcho's long,
stretchy legs

05:35.458 --> 05:37.875
make him really hard to catch!

05:37.875 --> 05:41.375
I-I think my costume
is broken.

05:41.375 --> 05:42.833
Whoa!

05:42.833 --> 05:44.291
(panting)

05:44.291 --> 05:45.875
Phew!

05:45.875 --> 05:47.708
Thanks for the help,
Bark Knight.

05:47.708 --> 05:49.458
No problem!
And Bob's monorail

05:49.458 --> 05:51.625
and teeny tiny Bob
are A-OK.

05:51.625 --> 05:53.583
Whew! If I'm gonna be
Captain Dog,

05:53.583 --> 05:54.833
I'll need to run way faster

05:54.833 --> 05:56.416
than I do as regular Rolly.

05:56.416 --> 06:00.708
Ha! Well, well,
if it isn't Rolly and Bingo.

06:00.708 --> 06:03.583
You mean,
"If it isn't Captain Dog
and the Bark Knight."

06:03.583 --> 06:06.458
I'm Colonel Catastrophe,
this is Lieutenant Thunk.

06:06.458 --> 06:08.083
-(growls)
-And in case you
didn't know,

06:08.083 --> 06:10.708
this is our play place now
and we want it to ourselves.

06:10.708 --> 06:13.000
So, anyone who isn't us,

06:13.000 --> 06:14.708
needs to leave Barksville.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.750
Now!

06:15.750 --> 06:17.875
-She's scary!
-Do we have to leave?

06:17.875 --> 06:19.375
Captain Dog?

06:19.375 --> 06:22.458
(thinking to himself):
Captain Dog is brave.
I'm brave.

06:22.458 --> 06:24.708
Sorry, Colonel Catastrophe,

06:24.708 --> 06:26.958
but Barksville belongs
to every dog.

06:26.958 --> 06:29.875
Let's see what Lieutenant Thunk
has to say about that.

06:29.875 --> 06:32.875
Lieutenant,
get everyone out of here!

06:32.875 --> 06:34.333
(murmurs)

06:34.333 --> 06:35.958
Forget the train!

06:35.958 --> 06:37.500
Focus! Focus!

06:37.500 --> 06:39.291
(chuckles)

06:39.291 --> 06:40.875
(monorail horn toots)

06:40.875 --> 06:43.333
Oh, no! He's going after
Bob's monorail.

06:43.333 --> 06:44.708
(monorail tooting)

06:44.708 --> 06:47.291
(chomping)

06:47.291 --> 06:49.375
Do something,
Captain Dog!

06:49.375 --> 06:51.583
Rolly!
Uh-- Captain Dog!

06:51.583 --> 06:54.583
-What are you doing?
-Saving the day!

06:56.250 --> 06:57.458
Hey!

06:59.458 --> 07:00.875
Frank!

07:01.875 --> 07:03.125
I'm okay!

07:03.125 --> 07:04.583
Frank:
All good here.

07:04.583 --> 07:06.750
Great work today,
Captain Dog!

07:06.750 --> 07:08.833
You saved us,
Captain Dog.

07:08.833 --> 07:10.875
Have you ever thought
of running for mayor?

07:10.875 --> 07:13.125

you did, Captain Dog.

Oh, I can fly.
I am Captain Dog, after all.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.625
It's okay, Captain Dog.

Okay, we've got
a monorail to fix,

09:09.833 --> 09:11.708
and now a flying saucer
to stop.

09:11.708 --> 09:13.583
You ready, Captain Dog?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.958
Rolly?

09:16.958 --> 09:19.708
The real Captain Dog
may be brave and can fly,

09:19.708 --> 09:21.000
but Rolly isn't brave

09:21.000 --> 09:22.875
and doesn't like
flying saucers.

09:22.875 --> 09:24.458
I'm not Captain Dog.

09:24.458 --> 09:26.416
I'm just regular Rolly.

09:26.416 --> 09:27.833
I like regular Rolly.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.125
He's funny.

09:29.125 --> 09:31.833
He digs the perfect holes
for burying things.

09:31.833 --> 09:34.875
And he's the bravest brother
in the whole world,

09:34.875 --> 09:36.750
who's always there
when I need him.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.625
And we're gonna fix
Bob's monorail

09:38.625 --> 09:40.375
so he can win
that contest.

09:40.375 --> 09:41.833
(dogs exclaiming)

09:43.000 --> 09:44.625
Aah!

09:44.625 --> 09:46.708
Oh, no!
The flying saucer's back.

09:49.250 --> 09:50.833
Come on, Captain Dog,

09:50.833 --> 09:53.000
let's save Barksville and--

09:53.000 --> 09:55.291
Uh, Rolly?

09:55.291 --> 09:57.500
(whimpering)

09:57.500 --> 09:59.875
Dog:
Everybody watch out!

09:59.875 --> 10:01.083
Oopsie.

10:04.166 --> 10:05.458
Watch out!

10:06.833 --> 10:07.875
Aah!

10:07.875 --> 10:10.458
-Huh?
-Look out!

10:10.458 --> 10:11.583
Oh!

10:12.708 --> 10:13.875
(monorail horn toots)

10:15.875 --> 10:17.458
-Aah!
-Look out!

10:19.458 --> 10:21.833
(dogs barking, shouting)

10:21.833 --> 10:23.875
Bob's train
is back on the track.

10:23.875 --> 10:25.875
If it makes it around
to the bridge,

10:25.875 --> 10:27.083
it'll fall and break!

10:28.833 --> 10:31.833
Gotta push this bridge back
so the monorail doesn't crash.

10:31.833 --> 10:32.958
(strains)

10:32.958 --> 10:34.875
The Bark Knight
needs help.

10:34.875 --> 10:36.708
Dog #2:
Somebody help him!

10:36.708 --> 10:38.875
(gasps)
Oh, no! Bingo!

10:38.875 --> 10:40.958
(horn tooting)

10:40.958 --> 10:43.625
-(groaning)
-Rolly: I'm coming, Bingo!

10:46.291 --> 10:49.083
It looks like
he's almost flying!

10:51.166 --> 10:52.291
(gasps)

10:52.291 --> 10:54.875
No, I'm brave.
Just like Bingo said.

10:54.875 --> 10:56.958
Not today, flying saucer!

10:56.958 --> 11:00.333
I've got a brother to help
and a Bob's monorail to save.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.875
(battle cry)

11:05.875 --> 11:06.708
(grunts)

11:12.583 --> 11:13.875
Come on, bridge.

11:13.875 --> 11:15.250
(groans)

11:16.833 --> 11:17.958
Oh, no!

11:21.458 --> 11:24.875
Did somebody holler
for a hero in a collar?

11:24.875 --> 11:27.000
You saved the day,
Captain Dog!

11:27.000 --> 11:28.500
Woo-hoo!

11:28.500 --> 11:29.958
-Woo!
-Yay!

11:29.958 --> 11:32.166
We saved the day,
Bingo.

11:32.166 --> 11:33.708
And I'm not
Captain Dog.

11:33.708 --> 11:36.708
You can call me
Captain Rolly.

11:36.708 --> 11:39.000
Well, looks like
you guys had fun.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.416
And the monorail's
still working perfectly.

11:41.416 --> 11:44.333
Aw, thanks for protecting it
for me while I was gone.

11:44.333 --> 11:45.833
No problem, Bob!

11:45.833 --> 11:48.958
(barking)

11:48.958 --> 11:50.958
And the winner
of the best recreation

11:50.958 --> 11:54.125
for this Barksville
play area is...

11:54.125 --> 11:57.958
...this spectacular model
of the Barksville monorail.

11:57.958 --> 11:59.583
Congratulations.

11:59.583 --> 12:01.250
Did you hear that, boys?

12:01.250 --> 12:03.125
We won! Ha ha!

12:03.125 --> 12:05.500
-You did it, Bob.
-Way to go, Bob!

12:05.500 --> 12:07.708
(barking)

12:07.708 --> 12:09.750
(upbeat music playing)

12:11.000 --> 12:13.875
Did somebody holler
for a hero in a collar?

12:13.875 --> 12:14.958
(bark)

12:17.166 --> 12:19.583
Rolly and Bingo:
"The Coolest Dogs in Town."

12:23.375 --> 12:25.291
Ahh.

12:25.291 --> 12:27.291
You said it, Bingo.

12:27.291 --> 12:28.875
Ahh.

12:28.875 --> 12:31.000
It's so hot out today,

12:31.000 --> 12:33.458
which is why this cool
doggie pool

12:33.458 --> 12:35.875
is the perfect place
to beat the heat.

12:35.875 --> 12:37.291
Hey, Hissy,

12:37.291 --> 12:40.125
you want to join us
in our cool pool?

12:40.125 --> 12:43.583
Thanks, but I'm gonna
stick with this dry shade.

12:43.583 --> 12:44.958
Bob:
Great gears!

12:44.958 --> 12:47.291
It is hot!

12:47.291 --> 12:49.458
And it's just as hot
inside the house

12:49.458 --> 12:51.875
as it is outside.

12:51.875 --> 12:54.416
I'm glad you three
found the perfect places

12:54.416 --> 12:55.833
to stay cool.

12:55.833 --> 12:57.458
When I get back from work,

12:57.458 --> 13:00.583
I need to find
the perfect place
to get cool, too.

13:00.583 --> 13:02.875
Ha! See you later.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Rolly, did you hear that?

13:06.000 --> 13:08.958
Bob said he needs to find
the perfect place to get cool.

13:08.958 --> 13:11.500
We can find one for him!
We're really good
at finding things.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.625
Hmm. Our doggie pool
is cool,

13:13.625 --> 13:15.375
but it isn't
big enough for Bob.

13:15.375 --> 13:17.166
And Hissy's shade
is cool, too,

13:17.166 --> 13:19.000
but it's only Hissy-sized.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.125
You know
what that means.

13:21.125 --> 13:24.375
I'm pretty sure I do,
but I'm gonna keep floating
and let you tell me.

13:24.375 --> 13:26.250
It means we have
a new mission.

13:26.250 --> 13:28.833
We need to find a place
for Bob to get cool.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
It's so much hotter

13:36.000 --> 13:37.708
outside of our cool pool.

13:37.708 --> 13:40.625
Which means it may be too hot
to walk around the city.

13:41.875 --> 13:43.333
Maybe A.R.F. can take us.

13:43.333 --> 13:45.708
Did A.R.F. just hear
A.R.F.'s name?

13:45.708 --> 13:47.125
(metal clanking)

13:47.125 --> 13:49.416
-(tires squealing)
-(crash)

13:49.416 --> 13:51.375
Can you give us a ride
to Bulworth's?

13:51.375 --> 13:53.333
Yeah,
he'll know a place
to stay cool.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.125
Oh, boy!
A.R.F. would love
to give you a ride.

13:57.166 --> 13:59.125
Hop on!

Sure.

14:38.625 --> 14:39.875
(laughs)

14:39.875 --> 14:42.583
I got plenty of ideas
for places to get cool.

14:42.583 --> 14:44.375
One of the best
places to be

14:44.375 --> 14:46.000
is in front of a fan.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.083
-We're ready, Bulworth.
-I've got a need.

14:48.083 --> 14:50.208
A need for a cold breeze.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.208
Well, this fan is broken.

15:00.208 --> 15:02.500
We are in a junkyard
after all.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.125
Now, here's an ice chest.

15:05.125 --> 15:06.583
Nothing beats being near

15:06.583 --> 15:09.458
the crisp coolness of ice.

15:09.458 --> 15:10.875
I love ice!

15:13.500 --> 15:15.458
Aw. Where's the ice?

15:15.458 --> 15:18.000
Well, of course,
to be near ice,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.208
you have to have ice,
which I do not.

15:20.208 --> 15:22.208
Because this ice chest
is broken.

15:22.208 --> 15:24.708
-That's why
it's in the junkyard.
-Exactly.

15:24.708 --> 15:27.125
But if you can find
ice to be near,

15:27.125 --> 15:28.875
it's a great place
to get cool.

15:28.875 --> 15:31.458
And that brings me
to my last idea:

15:31.458 --> 15:35.000
being in front of a nice,
cold sprinkler.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.208
I love sprinklers!

15:36.208 --> 15:37.958
They're so wet
and sprinkly.

15:37.958 --> 15:41.166
Does this sprinkler work,
or is it... broken?

15:41.166 --> 15:43.291
Junkyard. Right.
Of course.

15:43.291 --> 15:44.625
Sorry, pups.

15:44.625 --> 15:47.291
I never said I had
the actual places
to stay cool.

15:47.291 --> 15:50.000
But you did
give us great ideas
to start looking.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.708
Thank you, Bulworth.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.208
Hm.

16:00.208 --> 16:03.250
Rolly, I think I see
just the right place
up ahead.

16:11.625 --> 16:13.083
Bulworth was right.

16:13.083 --> 16:16.333
Sitting in front of a fan
is a great place to get cool.

16:16.333 --> 16:19.291
And it looks like
this could be perfect
for Bob.

16:19.291 --> 16:21.250
And if one fan
feels this good,

16:21.250 --> 16:23.708
then turning on all the fans
might feel even better.

16:24.708 --> 16:27.500
Sounds like a...
fan-tastic idea.

17:31.166 --> 17:34.375
Uh oh.
I think we turned on
one fan too many.

17:34.375 --> 17:36.083
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:39.583 --> 17:40.875
Ahh!

17:40.875 --> 17:42.083
A.R.F.:
Whoa!

17:42.083 --> 17:43.291
(crash)

17:46.166 --> 17:48.708
That fan store
is way too windy for Bob.

17:48.708 --> 17:51.291
You're telling me.
Where should we try next?

17:51.291 --> 17:53.333
Well, Bulworth said
that being near ice

17:53.333 --> 17:55.416
was another great place
to get cool.

17:55.416 --> 17:58.208
A.R.F., can you take us
to a place that has ice?

17:58.208 --> 18:00.625
Searching.
Searching.

18:02.958 --> 18:05.291
A.R.F. has found
just the place.

18:05.291 --> 18:07.708
-Where?
-Actually, right there.

18:07.708 --> 18:10.083
Ha ha!
This ice sculpture

18:10.083 --> 18:12.458
is a great decoration
for Teddy Peppercorn's

18:12.458 --> 18:15.250
birthday party tonight
at the baseball stadium.

18:15.250 --> 18:16.708
Hey, it looks
just like him,

18:16.708 --> 18:18.458
and it sure is cold.

18:18.458 --> 18:19.833
Brrr!

18:19.833 --> 18:21.625
Follow that ice sculpture.

18:22.708 --> 18:24.333
(teeth chattering)

18:24.333 --> 18:27.291
You were right, A.R.F.,
this place is cool.

18:28.333 --> 18:31.250
Yeah. Standing...
next to this...

18:31.250 --> 18:33.083
is so... cold...

18:33.083 --> 18:35.000
I'm... sh...shivering.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.291
I think we may have
found our spot.

18:37.291 --> 18:38.333
Right, Rolly?

18:39.833 --> 18:41.416
This almost
looks like a stick.

18:41.416 --> 18:42.750
A really cold stick.

18:42.750 --> 18:44.458
One little tiny chew
won't hurt.

18:44.458 --> 18:47.458
Um, A.R.F. does not
recommend doing that.

18:47.458 --> 18:49.000
(chomping)

18:51.708 --> 18:53.250
Well, how is it?

18:54.833 --> 18:57.583
This... ice...
is... cold...

18:57.583 --> 18:59.708
and... sticky.

19:02.458 --> 19:04.291
Whoa!

19:04.291 --> 19:05.500
Oh!

19:05.500 --> 19:06.875
Wee!

19:06.875 --> 19:08.166
Whoa!

19:08.166 --> 19:10.291
Hey! Check it out.

19:10.291 --> 19:12.333
It's just like ice skating.

19:12.333 --> 19:13.875
I don't know
how to ice skate!

19:13.875 --> 19:15.375
Wh-wh-whoa!

19:15.375 --> 19:17.375
Just try to slide
for the door.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.375
Whoo-ee!

19:22.416 --> 19:24.000
(laughing)

19:29.375 --> 19:31.708
Aw, I was just getting
the hang of that.

19:31.708 --> 19:34.083
It's almost time for Bob
to get home from work,

19:34.083 --> 19:36.375
and we still have to find
someplace cool!

19:36.375 --> 19:38.458
-We're going to the park.
-Bow to the wow!

19:38.458 --> 19:39.708
I love the park!

19:41.208 --> 19:43.416
A.R.F., take us
to the park.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.875
Yay! Park!

19:48.833 --> 19:51.000
I love sticking
my tongue out
in the wind!

19:52.291 --> 19:53.416
Me, too!

19:55.000 --> 19:56.125
Me, three!

19:56.125 --> 19:57.291
(metal creaking)

19:58.750 --> 20:01.958
And here's an extra scoop
of ice cream for you.

20:04.416 --> 20:05.583
Wh-wh-wh--

20:05.583 --> 20:07.000
A.R.F.:
Whoa!

20:08.208 --> 20:09.625
Uh-oh!

20:10.875 --> 20:12.416
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

20:12.416 --> 20:13.458
(crash)

20:16.500 --> 20:18.708
Well, we made it
to the park.

20:19.708 --> 20:21.583
Now, where are they?

20:22.583 --> 20:23.958
There!

20:23.958 --> 20:25.000
-Sprinklers!
-Sprinklers!

20:25.000 --> 20:26.583
Come on, Rolly.

20:26.583 --> 20:28.458
Let's go see if being
near a sprinkler

20:28.458 --> 20:30.333
really is a cool place
for Bob.

20:33.375 --> 20:35.375
Huh? Where'd
the sprinkler go?

20:35.375 --> 20:36.458
I don't know.

20:36.458 --> 20:38.416
It was here just
a second ago.

20:38.416 --> 20:40.250
(sniffing)

20:41.458 --> 20:44.416
That's okay.
Let's just go to the
one over there.

20:48.333 --> 20:50.000
Why are the sprinklers
hiding?

20:51.708 --> 20:54.208
Maybe the sprinklers
are playing hide-and-seek!

20:55.458 --> 20:57.333
I love that game.

20:59.416 --> 21:01.333
Here, sprinkler,
sprinkler, sprinkler.

21:09.125 --> 21:10.125
(gasps)

21:11.583 --> 21:13.583
Bow-wow, Bingo.
You were right.

21:13.583 --> 21:16.583
Whoa! This isn't a sprinkly
kind of sprinkler,

21:16.583 --> 21:19.250
this one's a sprinkler monster!

21:19.250 --> 21:20.750
Ah!

21:23.708 --> 21:25.000
I'll help you, Rolly.

21:27.708 --> 21:30.208
-(Rolly groaning)
-The sprinkler's too strong!

21:30.208 --> 21:31.750
I can't move!

21:31.750 --> 21:33.958
A.R.F. will save you!

21:33.958 --> 21:36.125
(gulping water)

21:37.375 --> 21:38.583
Come on, Rolly.

21:39.583 --> 21:41.875
(rapid computerized beeping)

21:47.000 --> 21:49.125
Phew!
Thanks, A.R.F.

21:49.125 --> 21:51.583
Yeah! Whew!
Thanks, A.R.F.

21:51.583 --> 21:53.166
A.R.F. is happy
A.R.F could help.

21:53.166 --> 21:54.625
(burps)

21:54.625 --> 21:55.583
Excuse A.R.F.

21:55.583 --> 21:58.583
We've tried everything
Bulworth suggested,

21:58.583 --> 22:01.458
and we still haven't found
a place for Bob to get cool.

22:01.458 --> 22:04.416
Yeah, the fan store
is way too blowy.

22:04.416 --> 22:06.625
Being next to ice
was too crashy and sticky.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.750
And this place
is way too unpredictable.

22:09.750 --> 22:11.708
And way too hot.

22:11.708 --> 22:13.750
Let's go back
to our cool place

22:13.750 --> 22:16.458
and try to think
of other places
for Bob to get cool.

22:16.458 --> 22:18.875
That's the coolest idea
I've heard all day.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.458
Ahh.

22:24.458 --> 22:27.000
Did you think
of any other places
for Bob to get cool yet?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.708
Not yet.

22:28.708 --> 22:31.375
I just hope we can
think of one before
he gets home.

22:31.375 --> 22:33.416
I'm home!

22:36.458 --> 22:38.458
-Welcome back, Bob.
-Hi, Bob!

22:38.458 --> 22:40.000
(barking)

22:40.000 --> 22:42.750
Whew! It is still
hot out here.

22:42.750 --> 22:44.500
But I'm glad to see
you guys

22:44.500 --> 22:46.458
have been
keeping cool today.

22:46.458 --> 22:49.250
Huh! Even Hissy's managed
to stay cool.

22:49.250 --> 22:50.458
Barely.

22:51.583 --> 22:54.458
Wait, what happened
to you, A.R.F.?

22:54.458 --> 22:56.458
It looks like
you're leaking water.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.708
Well, I'll just check
your valve here...

22:58.708 --> 23:00.708
Whoa!
(spitting water)

23:00.708 --> 23:01.875
(laughing)

23:01.875 --> 23:04.000
Hey! Look at that!

23:04.000 --> 23:05.625
I've been wanting
to find the best place

23:05.625 --> 23:07.333
to get cool all day,

23:07.333 --> 23:10.291
and the best place
was in my own backyard.

23:10.291 --> 23:12.416
(spitting water, laughing)

23:12.416 --> 23:14.125
(giggling)

23:15.125 --> 23:17.583
Bow to the wow!
We did it, Rolly!

23:17.583 --> 23:19.625
We found a place
for Bob to get cool.

23:19.625 --> 23:21.500
-High paw!
-High paw!

23:23.000 --> 23:24.708
(laughing)

23:31.708 --> 23:32.875
(theme music playing)

23:35.875 --> 23:37.083
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:41.125 --> 23:42.416
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:43.583 --> 23:46.125
(record scratching)

23:52.125 --> 23:53.208
Bark!

23:56.833 --> 23:58.333
Bark! Bark! Bark!
