Fuck!

01:36.554 --> 01:37.931
I got you. Here you go.

01:37.931 --> 01:38.848
Thank you.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.064
Hi.

01:46.064 --> 01:46.981
Hello.

01:46.981 --> 01:48.525
What's that patch mean?

01:49.400 --> 01:50.860
Are you a paramedic?

01:50.860 --> 01:53.696
Oh. Someday. EMT still.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.990
Took me three times to pass the test.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.784
But I fucking did it.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.077
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.578
It was super hard.

02:01.246 --> 02:02.080
I bet.

02:03.456 --> 02:04.499
But, wow.

02:05.166 --> 02:08.878
What a thing, just saving all those lives.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.089
I mean, yeah, you know.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.090
I guess.

02:16.010 --> 02:17.929
How'd you like to save one more?

02:19.848 --> 02:21.891
<i>All you got to do is kill me.</i>

02:46.416 --> 02:48.376
- Is he there?
Yeah.

02:48.376 --> 02:49.294
Good to go.

03:04.601 --> 03:05.643
Get my hand.

03:05.643 --> 03:06.644
Yeah. Okay.

03:08.730 --> 03:12.525
This is gonna slow the heart way down
so he'll think you're dead.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.736
But then it should wear off.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.070
Wait, "should"?

03:17.155 --> 03:19.032
That's just fucking super.

03:20.950 --> 03:22.035
Hmm.

03:22.785 --> 03:23.953
Oh...

03:24.621 --> 03:25.788
Fire two shots.

03:25.788 --> 03:28.082
The second you see him come in here,

03:28.082 --> 03:31.085
you wanna hit the siren
and get the ambulance over here

03:31.085 --> 03:33.504
before any cops show up. You underst--?

03:33.504 --> 03:34.797
I like using sirens.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.426
That's good to hear.

04:25.181 --> 04:26.140
Whoo!

04:28.393 --> 04:29.352
What the fuck?

04:37.527 --> 04:38.736
Dude, what?

04:40.321 --> 04:41.239
Whoo!

04:51.207 --> 04:52.250
Shit.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.711
Shit, shit, shit. No, Jason. Get up.

05:20.361 --> 05:22.155
<i>Hey.</i>
- Let me call you back.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.785
I got into the mini bar.

05:27.785 --> 05:29.120
Sorry.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.250
What happened to your plan?

05:34.250 --> 05:35.710
Florida happened.

05:36.669 --> 05:40.673
For a state shaped like a limp dick,
it can sure fuck a person over.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.802
You did a lot of work
to make me believe that you were dead.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.725
Why come here?

05:50.725 --> 05:53.478
Because some asshole
took my money and phone.

05:53.478 --> 05:57.398
And because the number of friends
I have in this place is one.

05:59.358 --> 06:03.446
Well, if you're counting me,
the number seems high, you know?

06:04.864 --> 06:06.783
Aren't you glad to see me, Mike?

06:09.077 --> 06:09.911
Yeah.

06:12.747 --> 06:13.664
Maybe a little.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.210
Because now I can trade you to Moss.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.795
- Get up.

06:20.546 --> 06:24.884
Oh. Moss. He'll be happy
to hear about your recovery.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.303
Yeah, except you're not gonna tell him.

06:27.303 --> 06:30.848
No, because if you take me back,
I'm dead for real.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.517
And that's not you.

06:34.018 --> 06:36.312
Then we're both
really poor judges of character.

06:36.312 --> 06:37.522
Stay there.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.107
"Stay there."

06:39.107 --> 06:41.275
Where am I going, fucking SeaWorld?

06:41.859 --> 06:43.111
Hey, Moss.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.320
Is she really dead?

06:47.865 --> 06:48.783
<i>Mike!</i>

06:52.370 --> 06:53.204
Yes.

06:54.330 --> 06:56.124
Yeah, Moss, she's really dead.

07:00.461 --> 07:01.295
Okay.

07:02.338 --> 07:03.297
Come back, then.

07:03.798 --> 07:04.632
<i>What?</i>

07:05.258 --> 07:06.551
Come back to Philly.

07:06.551 --> 07:07.760
No.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.178
<i>Don't start this.</i>

07:09.971 --> 07:11.347
Moss, we had a deal.

07:11.347 --> 07:12.974
I find Delly, I'm out.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.852
You ever been in my house, Mike?

07:16.436 --> 07:17.562
Yeah, Moss. Why?

07:18.938 --> 07:21.649
<i>You seen the pond with the fish?</i>

07:21.649 --> 07:22.942
The koi pond.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.696
I got a guy, Rico, he sells me the fish.

07:26.696 --> 07:31.993
See, if I made a deal with Rico for a fish
and he brought it to me dead,

07:32.994 --> 07:34.162
you think I'd pay him?

07:35.079 --> 07:38.166
- Moss.
- So get the fuck back here!

07:55.099 --> 07:57.101
Congratulations, you're dead.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.562
Welcome to the afterlife.

07:59.562 --> 08:00.688
Thanks.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.900
I knew it'd be hot,
but the humidity is crazy.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.234
You're free to go.

08:05.234 --> 08:06.444
So go.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.862
Is that what you want?

08:08.696 --> 08:09.906
For me to go?

08:12.658 --> 08:14.368
Doesn't matter what I want.

08:16.370 --> 08:17.663
It must a little.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.883
Where did you get that coin?

08:32.136 --> 08:34.472
Moss, listen to me.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.433
In 1715...

08:37.433 --> 08:38.643
I'm already bored.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.145
...the Spanish Fleet went down
and this one ship sank.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.814
I heard from this guy in a meeting.

08:43.814 --> 08:45.816
He told me
it might be off Central Florida,

08:45.816 --> 08:49.487
- so I went down there and I found it--
- You know, I wish I had dogs.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.072
- What?
Dogs.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.907
Four of them. Big dogs.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.785
And I'd take you out back
and I'd feed you to them right now.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.078
I swear to God.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.080
Except I'm allergic to most dog breeds

08:59.080 --> 09:02.833
and I can't see feeding you
to a pack of standard Poodles.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.171
Go on.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.508
You have five more words, then I kill you.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.301
Choose them wisely.

09:13.261 --> 09:16.430
One hundred million dollars.

09:19.642 --> 09:20.810
Approximately.

09:21.644 --> 09:22.478
Where?

09:23.229 --> 09:24.939
Central Florida, man.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.067
<i>He said it was in Orlando</i>

09:28.067 --> 09:31.320
in a Penske truck at Lake and Colonial.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.615
Moss had a guy down here check it out
and he said it wasn't there.

09:35.199 --> 09:37.076
So I came down and checked too.

09:37.743 --> 09:38.578
Nothing.

09:38.578 --> 09:44.292
But I thought if I could find Gil's boat,
there might be a clue in it

09:44.292 --> 09:46.544
or even the gold itself.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.212
I'm all-in here.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.174
I have nothing else in my hand.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.846
I have to check out Gil's boat
myself anyway.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.264
I promised a friend.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.392
You know where his boat is?

10:03.060 --> 10:04.103
We go there.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.481
If there's nothing on it,
then you can make another plan.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.362
What about tonight?

10:15.364 --> 10:17.116
What do you mean? The marina's closed.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.576
No.

10:18.576 --> 10:21.370
I mean, what about tonight?

10:23.039 --> 10:25.041
Unless you want me to get my own room
at this place,

10:25.041 --> 10:27.335
but you'll have to loan me
the eight bucks.

10:31.547 --> 10:33.299
This is not the situation anymore.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.177
- No?
- No.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.598
You like to read.
You know who Orpheus was?

10:40.598 --> 10:41.557
Yeah.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.436
He was sent
to bring his lover back from hell.

10:46.020 --> 10:49.315
Only rule was if he did,
he couldn't look back at her.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.069
And he almost made it.

10:55.738 --> 10:56.739
<i>Almost.</i>

10:58.115 --> 10:59.367
But he hesitated.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.203
He couldn't resist.

11:04.038 --> 11:05.164
He looked.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.459
And she ended up in hell forever.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.295
<i>Welcome to hell, Mike.</i>

11:18.469 --> 11:19.804
Won't be staying long.

11:41.075 --> 11:42.660
<i>And coming up at 10:00,</i>

11:42.660 --> 11:47.415
we'll have a report on an unfolding story
of a liquor store robbery in Kissimmee

11:47.415 --> 11:48.999
that ended very badly.

11:48.999 --> 11:53.045
<i>The man who threatened the owner
with a World War II hand grenade</i>

11:53.045 --> 11:55.005
<i>got more bang than he bargained for.</i>

11:55.005 --> 11:58.884
- You picked the wrong fucking store!
- I'll shove this down your dick hole!

11:58.884 --> 12:01.011
- You little-dicked motherfucker!
- Fuck you!

12:01.011 --> 12:04.598
- I'll cut your baby dick off!
- Fuck you! No, I didn't, bitch!

12:07.601 --> 12:08.936
Goddamn it!

12:08.936 --> 12:10.938
What's that expression, Kaitlin?

12:10.938 --> 12:13.107
"Never bring a sword
to a hand grenade fight"?

12:19.071 --> 12:20.739
God. Fuck.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.092
Iris.
Hmm?

12:40.092 --> 12:41.469
Gil Franco murder?

12:42.344 --> 12:46.056
Uh, Moss Yankov had an alibi.
His girlfriend's birthday dinner.

12:46.056 --> 12:49.351
- Name?
- Delly West of Chicago. No priors.

12:49.351 --> 12:50.478
- Delly?
- Mm-hm.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.688
What's that short for, Delilah?

12:52.688 --> 12:54.398
I don't know. Adele?

12:54.398 --> 12:56.484
Where'd she put him after dinner?

12:56.484 --> 12:58.694
When we find her, I'll let you know.

12:59.528 --> 13:00.779
Could be Delgado.

13:01.780 --> 13:02.656
Ma'am?

13:04.492 --> 13:06.702
At the Academy, they called me Delly.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.746
I put a stop to that.

13:11.832 --> 13:13.417
Okay.

13:38.776 --> 13:42.863
Medium extreme ultimate vanilla
ice blended with two shots of caramel.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.448
Thank you.

13:49.870 --> 13:51.330
My dad would have liked it here.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.416
He's not around anymore?

13:57.127 --> 13:58.295
Yours still alive?

14:00.339 --> 14:01.257
In Florida.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.384
So, yes and no.

14:04.718 --> 14:06.804
Seems like an okay place to retire.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.099
You can never retire from crime.

14:12.685 --> 14:13.561
Crime?

14:14.603 --> 14:15.813
He's not a good guy.

14:16.981 --> 14:20.776
My dad always talked about this place,
like some heavenly reward.

14:21.610 --> 14:24.572
"If you get good grades,
we'll take you to Florida.

14:24.572 --> 14:27.074
If I have a good year,
we're going to Florida, kid."

14:28.617 --> 14:31.579
In my head, it got built up
into this magical land.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.415
Treasure, exotic creatures.

14:34.415 --> 14:38.168
I even read somewhere the circus
would come down here to spend the winter.

14:38.168 --> 14:39.879
I don't think it ever left.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.048
And, yeah, there might be
some exotic creatures,

14:43.716 --> 14:45.134
but there's no treasure.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.304
There is so.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.223
People find stuff all the time.

14:51.724 --> 14:52.933
Not Gil's treasure.

14:55.561 --> 14:59.231
You'd have better luck finding a mermaid
than any of that gold.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.861
- I'll take you to the boat, you'll see.
- No, you'll see.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.863
And I happen to believe in mermaids.

15:06.947 --> 15:07.948
Of course you do.

15:11.702 --> 15:15.748
<i>♪ There's a cool breeze blowin'
Around us tonight ♪</i>

15:17.207 --> 15:20.252
<i>♪ Gonna love you
Till the moon don't shine... ♪</i>

15:22.004 --> 15:23.505
God, that's terrible!

15:27.259 --> 15:29.887
<i>Letting Jay Cobb use your boat again, huh?</i>

15:29.887 --> 15:33.349
<i>I'm neighborly that way.
As long as he returns it with a full tank.</i>

15:33.349 --> 15:35.643
Hmm. And a cut
of whatever he moves with it?

15:35.643 --> 15:39.855
How Jay Cobb expresses his gratitude
is entirely his affair.

15:40.564 --> 15:42.232
So, where's your boy?

15:43.233 --> 15:44.109
I don't know.

15:45.152 --> 15:46.111
Gone maybe.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.446
Sorry to hear that.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.198
You have a...

15:49.740 --> 15:51.700
lighter step about you since he's come.

16:03.754 --> 16:04.797
Officer Boone.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.841
- Can I help you?
- Maybe.

16:08.842 --> 16:10.761
Where were you three nights ago?

16:13.639 --> 16:14.473
Right here,

16:14.473 --> 16:17.476
enjoying the luxury appointments
of the Palm's Motel.

16:19.603 --> 16:20.771
And if I check,

16:21.438 --> 16:23.273
what story is that camera going to tell?

16:25.109 --> 16:28.696
Probably a sad one
about no one caring enough to plug it in.

16:32.449 --> 16:34.535
- Well, I got a story too.
- Mm-hm.

16:35.285 --> 16:37.913
It's about how
I looked into a woman for you.

16:37.913 --> 16:41.083
And then a woman
matching that same description

16:41.083 --> 16:43.711
was stretchered out of the Bungalows dead,

16:43.711 --> 16:45.045
- after the--
Mike!

16:45.045 --> 16:46.588
- After the--
Let's go.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.382
Let's go, Mike.

16:49.299 --> 16:50.426
Sorry, officer.

16:50.426 --> 16:54.680
He promised he'd take me for some grits
everyone's been going on about.

16:54.680 --> 16:58.392
Please remember where you left off.
I really wanna hear the rest of the story.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.073
<i>Benjamin, he needs to go.</i>

17:13.782 --> 17:14.867
Who?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.326
Mike again?

17:16.910 --> 17:18.370
He is a good man.

17:18.370 --> 17:19.288
Good man?

17:19.288 --> 17:23.667
Last night I hear that good man
talking about a dead girl.

17:23.667 --> 17:26.503
Then the police come here
asking questions.

17:26.503 --> 17:29.465
It does not involve us.
He is a paying customer.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.468
And we need to keep our eyes
on our own prize.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.387
None of his problems are ours.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.683
Yes, Benjamin.

17:40.517 --> 17:42.227
But how long before they are?

17:46.315 --> 17:49.943
I'm standing here with cash in hand,
legal United States tender,

17:49.943 --> 17:52.529
and you will not sell me
one of the many guns you have?

17:52.529 --> 17:54.281
I'll sell you all the guns you want,

17:54.281 --> 17:56.033
but you can't walk out with them.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.077
- You can have it shipped.
- To my home state.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.496
Which is what I've heard
up and down every row in this place.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.206
You might start to think it's true.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.249
Goddamn it.
How is it possible that I stumbled

18:04.249 --> 18:07.086
onto the only law abiding gun show
in America?

18:07.086 --> 18:08.462
This is Florida!

18:08.462 --> 18:10.339
The goddamn state is shaped like a gun.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.467
You can't walk to your mailbox
without tripping over three of them.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.719
God forbid, you sell one to a cop!

18:22.351 --> 18:23.811
You have a good day, officer.

18:26.522 --> 18:27.523
Mister.

18:29.733 --> 18:30.734
What do you need?

18:36.532 --> 18:37.533
Wanna buy it?

18:43.038 --> 18:44.832
<i>This is Mike. Leave a message.</i>

18:45.332 --> 18:46.166
Hey, Mike.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.043
Kaitlin Fox again.

18:48.043 --> 18:50.838
Not used to a man not calling me back. Kidding.

18:50.838 --> 18:53.215
I wanted to see
if you got the ambulance footage,

18:53.215 --> 18:54.883
and talk about that story?

18:54.883 --> 18:57.469
I hope you're keeping out of trouble. Bye.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.852
<i>Anything?</i>
<i>No.</i>

19:04.852 --> 19:07.187
Just a lot of these auto-rifle cases.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.816
So, maybe the gold
is in the cases somewhere.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.860
Or maybe there never was any.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.153
Or he was moving weapons.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.905
No, there was. You didn't hear him.

19:16.905 --> 19:19.158
I've been him, Delly.

19:19.741 --> 19:22.578
A gambler will say anything
to save his own skin.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.082
Okay.

19:33.380 --> 19:34.590
Where are you going?

19:35.674 --> 19:36.717
To save yours.

19:37.801 --> 19:38.635
What?

19:40.262 --> 19:41.138
Seriously?

19:41.138 --> 19:42.055
Yeah.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.933
I need the keys to my brother's boat.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.018
Gil Franco.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.270
No can do. You're not the owner.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.190
No, but my actual bro is
and he passed away.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.274
Sucks.

19:54.651 --> 19:55.736
Hmm.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.280
Can I just have the keys?

19:58.280 --> 19:59.281
I'm in a hurry.

20:03.076 --> 20:05.412
Maybe you should hurry up and fuck off.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.251
Yeah, I'm sorry.

20:11.752 --> 20:12.669
My bad.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.796
Let's start over again.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.967
- Hey! Ow, ow!
- Take it back.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.469
What the fuck, man?

20:20.469 --> 20:22.137
Take it back and give me the keys.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.138
Take it back.

20:23.138 --> 20:25.182
All right, I take it back. Jesus.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.727
Fuck, man!

20:31.897 --> 20:33.398
Tell anyone I was here

20:33.398 --> 20:37.110
and I'll tip the cops off about
the little pot farm you have in the back.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.364
Maybe, what, 50 plants?

20:41.740 --> 20:44.451
So now go in the dickmaster's office
and get me the keys.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.664
It's "dockmaster's."

20:55.212 --> 20:57.673
Okay, pay attention.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.634
You start it like a car.

21:00.634 --> 21:03.679
Throttle is here, forward is forward.
Back is back.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.974
- Wait, what?
- Turn off the GPS so no one can track you.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.934
Why are you telling me this?

21:08.934 --> 21:12.020
Because Moss is going to
start asking questions I can't answer,

21:12.020 --> 21:14.022
and you need to get out of here.

21:14.022 --> 21:16.984
At the ocean, go left for Canada,
right for South America.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.945
- It doesn't matter, just go where you can.
- I don't wanna go.

21:19.945 --> 21:23.448
Don't waste your life looking
for something that doesn't exist.

21:23.448 --> 21:26.535
No, you fucking moron,
I don't wanna go without you.

21:37.045 --> 21:40.465
Bullshit. You took off to Florida
without telling me.

21:40.465 --> 21:41.925
I said let's run away.

21:42.467 --> 21:43.510
Find a highway.

21:43.510 --> 21:46.013
I used those words, Mike.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.890
I thought we were just talking.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.440
Guess we were. Fine.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.443
Fine.

22:03.947 --> 22:07.659
I didn't do all this to wind up
working at an IHOP in Venezuela.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.163
I'm staying right here
and finding that truck.

22:29.598 --> 22:30.766
What are you doing?

22:37.397 --> 22:38.273
Hey, Moss.

22:39.316 --> 22:41.902
Listen, I was thinking, you had a shock.

22:41.902 --> 22:42.903
<i>When it wears off,</i>

22:42.903 --> 22:45.280
<i>you're gonna wanna know
who did this to Delly.</i>

22:45.781 --> 22:46.740
Go on.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.451
What if it was a message?

22:49.451 --> 22:51.411
<i>Well, what kind of message?</i>

22:51.411 --> 22:54.873
To you, saying you're not your father.

22:58.293 --> 23:00.170
"We're not afraid of you."

23:02.422 --> 23:04.091
They fucking better be.

23:04.841 --> 23:06.885
<i>I know. So, new deal.</i>

23:07.719 --> 23:09.805
<i>I stay, find out who did it,</i>

23:09.805 --> 23:11.681
and then I walk away for good.

23:15.894 --> 23:19.731
<i>You're weighing how much I owe you
against knowing who killed her.</i>

23:19.731 --> 23:20.982
<i>Shut up!</i>

23:20.982 --> 23:22.317
<i>I'm thinking.</i>

23:23.110 --> 23:23.944
<i>Fine.</i>

23:24.653 --> 23:25.654
Find him.

23:25.654 --> 23:28.782
Mike, bring them to me to take care of.

23:29.783 --> 23:30.826
Then we're done.

23:33.787 --> 23:34.621
Or her.

23:35.497 --> 23:36.581
What?

23:37.249 --> 23:39.251
Could be a girl that killed Delly.

23:40.001 --> 23:43.547
Traditional gender roles
are being rethought across many areas.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.972
Mom, how much longer to Gatorland?

23:51.972 --> 23:54.516
Can we go on the zip line? Please?

23:54.516 --> 23:55.851
Hell no.

23:55.851 --> 23:58.770
God only knows what meth head
screwed that thing together.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.772
When it comes down
in a pool of alligators,

24:00.772 --> 24:02.566
I can promise you we won't be on it.

24:06.153 --> 24:06.987
Oh, no.

24:06.987 --> 24:09.406
Daddy, did you break the law?

24:10.574 --> 24:12.325
Daddy didn't break the law.

24:12.325 --> 24:13.785
Daddy is the law.

24:19.833 --> 24:20.917
Keep it casual.

24:20.917 --> 24:22.169
Okay.

24:25.839 --> 24:26.840
Morning, trooper.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.049
Is there a problem?

24:28.049 --> 24:29.801
License and registration.

24:31.136 --> 24:33.388
Bet I was going a little fast there, huh?

24:33.388 --> 24:34.598
Sorry about that.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.850
Kids are excited about Gatorland.

24:36.850 --> 24:37.851
You been?

24:38.310 --> 24:40.270
My daddy's your boss.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.688
Olivia, sit back.

24:45.192 --> 24:46.234
Sheriff's deputy.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.069
Durham County.

24:48.528 --> 24:51.364
Got a few buddies
in the highway patrol up there myself.

24:51.364 --> 24:54.242
Most dangerous job in law enforcement,
bar none.

24:54.242 --> 24:56.036
I respect the work you do.

24:58.205 --> 24:59.080
Registration.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.585
Sorry, it's not here. And where is it?

25:03.585 --> 25:06.421
It's a rental car, so I wouldn't know.
Would I?

25:06.421 --> 25:07.839
No, no. Um...

25:08.506 --> 25:09.341
Wait.

25:10.508 --> 25:12.260
Are you kidding me with that?

25:14.095 --> 25:15.889
<i>Bend over, spread your cheeks.</i>

25:19.184 --> 25:20.977
Bend over, spread your cheeks.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.356
Bend over, spread your cheeks.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.568
Bend over, spread your cheeks.

25:30.445 --> 25:31.404
Damn it.

25:31.404 --> 25:33.323
There's a new Yelp review. Did you see?

25:33.323 --> 25:34.908
I don't read those Yelp reviews.

25:34.908 --> 25:37.160
You shouldn't be able
to Yelp review the police.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.454
- Where's the forensic light?
- What you need it for?

25:39.454 --> 25:41.581
The crime lab has to run the blood
from the Bungalows.

25:41.581 --> 25:44.334
And I wanna go to the scene
and see if I can scare up

25:44.334 --> 25:45.669
some more fluids and such.

25:47.295 --> 25:49.256
Where is the luminol spray?

25:49.256 --> 25:50.507
That's all on me.

25:50.507 --> 25:54.135
I thought it was computer screen cleaner,
and I used it all.

25:54.135 --> 25:56.721
- Did you want me to buy you some more?
- No.

25:56.721 --> 25:58.765
I am trying here, I really am,

25:58.765 --> 26:02.644
to staunch the bleeding
from the gaping wound that is this town.

26:02.644 --> 26:04.562
You know what? Honestly, never mind.

26:04.562 --> 26:07.440
Everyone in this whole place
can go ahead and kill each other.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.359
We won't even try to catch them anymore.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.619
- Come on.

26:19.619 --> 26:21.788
<i>Hi, this is Mike. Leave a message.</i>

26:21.788 --> 26:23.873
Mike, it's me.

26:24.749 --> 26:28.003
Just wondering what's happening,
you know, with my fucking life and all.

26:29.796 --> 26:31.840
<i>I didn't know the gun was a murder weapon.</i>

26:31.840 --> 26:35.051
You think I specifically went
shopping for a murder weapon?

26:35.051 --> 26:38.763
<i>We can't keep paying for a hotel
and boarding the dog is costing a fortune.</i>

26:38.763 --> 26:40.765
<i>We need to find you a lawyer.</i>

26:40.765 --> 26:41.933
<i>I don't know--</i>

26:41.933 --> 26:47.230
- Hold on, honey. Wait, what was that?

26:48.523 --> 26:50.483
Excuse me. This phone isn't working.

26:50.483 --> 26:52.402
Touchscreen. Put it on speaker.

26:54.321 --> 26:55.739
<i>How can they do this?</i>

26:55.739 --> 26:57.907
<i>You're a decorated police officer.</i>

26:57.907 --> 27:00.618
<i>You've put hundreds
of criminals behind bars.</i>

27:06.916 --> 27:07.834
<i>Shit!</i>

27:07.834 --> 27:09.336
Goddamn it!

27:11.004 --> 27:12.088
Shit!

27:12.839 --> 27:15.342
No, no, no...

27:15.342 --> 27:16.551
Shit!

27:17.385 --> 27:19.346
Damn it!

27:25.894 --> 27:27.395
Iris, hey.

27:27.395 --> 27:29.022
<i>Do you know a Delly West?</i>

27:29.898 --> 27:31.649
Yep. Moss's girlfriend, why?

27:32.942 --> 27:35.445
She's his alibi
the night of Gil Franco's murder.

27:35.445 --> 27:37.113
They were at dinner together?

27:38.865 --> 27:40.533
Yep. Mm-hm.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.162
And she was with him all night.

27:48.083 --> 27:48.917
Yep.

27:49.751 --> 27:50.585
She was.

27:50.585 --> 27:52.379
<i>Any idea where she could be?</i>

27:53.505 --> 27:54.422
Nope.

27:54.964 --> 27:56.383
<i>How much do you know about her?</i>

27:57.258 --> 27:58.968
Nothing. Really.

28:00.220 --> 28:02.180
Mike, how much do you owe Moss?

28:03.515 --> 28:05.100
I'm working that off.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.351
I'm almost there.

28:07.185 --> 28:08.645
<i>As mad as you make me,</i>

28:08.645 --> 28:11.147
I still don't want to see you
chopped up in pieces.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.691
<i>I'll see you soon. I have to go.</i>

28:24.744 --> 28:25.703
Michael!

28:28.665 --> 28:29.582
Hey.

28:57.485 --> 28:58.945
Oh, yes!

29:00.989 --> 29:03.658
- Fuck! Whoa!

29:03.658 --> 29:04.576
Shit.

29:12.959 --> 29:15.086
Whoo! Yes!

29:15.670 --> 29:16.504
Yes.

29:19.174 --> 29:21.885
Want to see my toilet?
He doesn't want to see.

29:21.885 --> 29:25.263
He will want to see this one.
It's one of those Japanese automatic ones.

29:25.263 --> 29:28.600
I got it for cost from a foreman
on the job that I'm on,

29:28.600 --> 29:30.310
who accidentally over-ordered.

29:30.935 --> 29:31.895
Very exciting.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.480
Heated seat, water jets--

29:33.480 --> 29:36.065
Can I have a minute
with my sister, please?

29:37.150 --> 29:38.568
Alexa, flush.

29:38.568 --> 29:40.779
- Deacon, I mean it.

29:44.824 --> 29:47.076
I need your help with something.

29:47.076 --> 29:49.871
There's a guy in the ICU at Coronado.

29:49.871 --> 29:52.040
An EMT. He was on the news.

29:52.665 --> 29:54.751
I need you to check on his status.

29:55.543 --> 29:57.629
Is this about that woman
you were looking for?

29:58.463 --> 30:01.257
He's in a coma,
but he might know where she is.

30:01.257 --> 30:03.593
If he's gonna wake up, I can ask him.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.011
And if he doesn't?

30:05.011 --> 30:09.432
Then I can call my boss,
tell him I've hit a dead end, and go home.

30:10.391 --> 30:13.144
That puts me in a pickle
because I don't want you to go home.

30:13.144 --> 30:15.104
I know that you don't want to live here,

30:15.104 --> 30:16.940
but you never know how things go.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.734
If you told me 15 years ago,
when life was full of promise,

30:19.734 --> 30:22.028
that I'd be married to a man
whose greatest dream

30:22.028 --> 30:24.447
is to own a robot toilet,
I'd have called you crazy.

30:25.782 --> 30:26.825
That was mean.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.159
Yes, I'll help you.

30:28.159 --> 30:30.829
- Thank you. Call me.
- Where are you going?

30:34.666 --> 30:36.709
Patsy, I'm not gonna go out there.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.920
Okay. Then I don't wanna help you.

30:39.420 --> 30:40.380
Patsy.

30:43.007 --> 30:44.133
Let's go.

30:44.133 --> 30:46.094
Stop being a baby. Come on.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.428
We're never all together.

31:09.534 --> 31:10.743
Dunney has a theory.

31:12.954 --> 31:13.872
About?

31:14.706 --> 31:15.707
Moss Yankov.

31:16.291 --> 31:17.208
Dunney.

31:18.251 --> 31:22.171
Since he took over from his old man,
Moss doesn't get his hands dirty anymore.

31:22.171 --> 31:24.841
He would have delegated Gil Franco
to one of his guys.

31:24.841 --> 31:27.510
And those guys include Mike Valentine.

31:27.510 --> 31:29.929
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

31:29.929 --> 31:32.974
Were you aware?
- Yes. But Mike's not a murderer.

31:32.974 --> 31:34.517
But you see my problem.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.519
Any appearance of conflict of interest--

31:36.519 --> 31:39.856
No. We haven't been married for a year.
There's no conflict of interest.

31:39.856 --> 31:42.483
No, there isn't.
'Cause you're off the case.

31:59.542 --> 32:02.170
Well, she's not gonna fuck you now.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.131
We should have a funeral.

32:05.131 --> 32:06.549
Is there even a body?

32:06.549 --> 32:07.967
Why wouldn't there be a body?

32:08.593 --> 32:09.510
I don't know.

32:09.510 --> 32:11.971
It's a murder.
Maybe they gotta keep it a while.

32:13.264 --> 32:15.558
Oh, well, a memorial then.

32:15.558 --> 32:18.144
A big one, like we had for my father.

32:18.144 --> 32:20.355
And everyone came out of respect.

32:20.355 --> 32:23.107
I do a memorial for Delly,
they all have to come.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.525
Fuck them, right?

32:25.068 --> 32:26.152
Fuck them.

32:26.152 --> 32:27.236
Take care of it.

32:27.236 --> 32:31.240
Make it special, with the nice flowers,
like the carnations.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.492
And a cake.

32:44.170 --> 32:45.171
Shit!

32:48.007 --> 32:49.008
No.

32:49.842 --> 32:50.969
Damn it.

32:56.933 --> 32:57.892
Hey, kid.

33:00.019 --> 33:01.646
That thing have a USB port?

33:07.235 --> 33:09.195
Grandpa, love it.

33:09.195 --> 33:10.154
What is it?

33:10.154 --> 33:13.074
A police scanner.
Daddy always had one in the house.

33:13.074 --> 33:14.993
They don't make them like that anymore.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.703
Police, fire, Coast Guard.

33:17.286 --> 33:18.788
Tracking the Coast Guard.

33:18.788 --> 33:20.832
- Fun. Kids love that.
Michael.

33:22.041 --> 33:23.876
Thanks. I'm gonna go set it up.

33:24.419 --> 33:25.753
We're about to eat.

33:25.753 --> 33:27.755
- Ty--
Let her go.

33:27.755 --> 33:30.091
Guy at the flea market
didn't know what he had.

33:30.091 --> 33:31.134
The flea market.

33:31.134 --> 33:33.511
- Remember Mama used to take us?
Hmm? Mm-mm.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.054
That's where I got it.

33:35.054 --> 33:38.266
That's not still going on.
- Lake and Colonial, every Saturday.

33:38.266 --> 33:40.852
I remember Mama would jump out the car...

33:40.852 --> 33:44.147
He said it was in a Penske truck
at Lake and Colonial.

33:56.367 --> 33:57.285
<i>Mike.</i>

33:58.244 --> 33:59.579
- Mike.
- Hmm?

34:00.329 --> 34:01.956
Okay, he wasn't listening.

34:01.956 --> 34:03.332
Doughnuts.

34:03.332 --> 34:04.792
What about them?

34:04.792 --> 34:08.046
You and I, we used to go buy doughnuts
every Saturday.

34:08.046 --> 34:10.214
- We never did that.
Yeah, we did.

34:10.214 --> 34:12.050
We did things together. It was fun!

34:15.636 --> 34:17.764
I have to go. See you later.

34:18.473 --> 34:19.766
Okay. I'll call you.

34:20.850 --> 34:23.227
Hey! What were you talking to Patsy about?

34:23.227 --> 34:25.438
Planning your birthday party.
Don't spoil it.

34:25.438 --> 34:27.273
- Bullshit, why are you here?
- Nothing.

34:29.108 --> 34:30.693
Nobody comes here for nothing.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.362
It doesn't concern you.

34:33.362 --> 34:36.157
When it comes to my daughter,
it definitely does concern me.

34:36.157 --> 34:39.660
If you want something,
you don't go to her, you come to me.

34:40.578 --> 34:43.790
- It doesn't have to be bad between us.
- There is no us.

34:46.250 --> 34:47.251
Got it?

35:05.686 --> 35:10.733
<i>So, finding the coin in that fish,
my dad said it was a sign.</i>

35:11.526 --> 35:14.862
<i>That I was destined for great things.</i>

35:18.324 --> 35:20.284
And a boy trusts his dad, right?

35:21.160 --> 35:23.204
He said I was a winner.
So, that's what I was.

35:23.788 --> 35:26.207
When my mom was gone, that kept me going.

35:26.207 --> 35:27.750
Chasing the next win.

35:28.668 --> 35:30.253
The next coin in the fish.

35:32.046 --> 35:34.799
<i>My dad said, "The treasure was right there
if I wanted it."</i>

35:35.967 --> 35:37.718
<i>I based my whole life on that promise.</i>

35:39.011 --> 35:43.099
Because normal people,
they find a gold coin and they go,

35:43.099 --> 35:44.684
"Oh, neat, a gold coin."

35:44.684 --> 35:49.272
Us? We start looking
for prospecting tools, right?

35:49.772 --> 35:50.648
Yeah.

35:59.574 --> 36:00.950

36:09.709 --> 36:13.504
- I parked my truck here and now it's gone.
- Did you leave it there after Thursday?

36:14.505 --> 36:16.591
Can't remember. But let's say yes.

36:16.591 --> 36:17.800
Then it was towed.

36:25.099 --> 36:27.894
<i>Some people
don't go looking for trouble.</i>

36:27.894 --> 36:29.604

36:33.858 --> 36:36.819

37:04.180 --> 37:06.557

37:07.600 --> 37:09.393
