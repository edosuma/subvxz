00:14.247 --> 00:15.682
What happened?

00:17.450 --> 00:19.519
There was a crash.

00:19.519 --> 00:22.655
One of the alien ships spit some
kind of bioweapon in my eyes-

00:22.655 --> 00:23.656
a gas.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.294
What's wrong with Daddy?

00:28.294 --> 00:29.162
Silas.

00:29.162 --> 00:30.764
Kylie, come on.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.874
Send Silas.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.042
You need an antibiotic
and steroid drops.

00:43.042 --> 00:45.044
Silas won't know
where to get them.

00:45.044 --> 00:47.480
You're not going to find
an open pharmacy, Lynn.

00:47.480 --> 00:51.017
They're probably all
ransacked or destroyed.

00:51.017 --> 00:52.585
A small urgent care
is better anyway.

00:52.585 --> 00:54.954
There's one a few miles
from here.

00:54.954 --> 00:56.456
It's too dangerous.

00:56.456 --> 00:58.291
Not having my husband
well enough to protect us

00:58.291 --> 00:59.559
is dangerous.

01:12.472 --> 01:15.575
We need you well.

01:15.575 --> 01:19.112
I need you well.

01:19.112 --> 01:20.880
This is the only way.

02:31.718 --> 02:33.186
Hello, Feena.

02:33.186 --> 02:33.887
Shh!

02:33.887 --> 02:34.988
Quiet.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.155
Are you lost?

02:36.155 --> 02:37.123
No.

02:37.123 --> 02:38.625
Buzz off.

02:47.033 --> 02:49.369
Can I provide
assistance?

02:49.369 --> 02:52.472
A light, perhaps?

02:52.472 --> 02:53.706
You want to help me?

02:53.706 --> 02:56.276
Let me talk to Duncan.

02:56.276 --> 02:58.278
The answer is still no,
Feena.

02:58.278 --> 02:59.012
Why?

02:59.012 --> 03:00.146
Because it might
make me happy?

03:00.146 --> 03:03.216
Because I do not project
holograms for your amusement.

03:03.216 --> 03:04.183
My amusement.

03:04.183 --> 03:05.818
For someone so concerned
with the human race,

03:05.818 --> 03:08.454
you know next to nothing
about it.

03:08.454 --> 03:11.057
Why am I even talking to you?

03:11.057 --> 03:12.392
You're not in charge.

03:19.999 --> 03:21.768
Can't sleep either?

03:21.768 --> 03:24.971
Sorry, I didn't know
you were in here.

03:24.971 --> 03:26.606
Room's big enough for two.

03:38.117 --> 03:40.386
You overheard?

03:40.386 --> 03:45.124
Hard not to.

03:45.124 --> 03:47.994
Duncan was someone...

03:47.994 --> 03:51.030
special to me.

03:51.030 --> 03:53.800
The drone has
his brain state.

03:53.800 --> 03:57.670
So you came to the Obelisk
to ask that he be reborn?

03:57.670 --> 03:59.272
They said if we did
what they asked,

03:59.272 --> 04:01.307
they would give us
more people.

04:01.307 --> 04:02.875
You got the weapon.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.978
We did what they asked.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.946
So give us more people.

04:06.946 --> 04:08.514
Couldn't agree more.

04:08.514 --> 04:10.316
And if they're going to
give us more people,

04:10.316 --> 04:12.418
they might as well be
people we care about.

04:12.418 --> 04:14.287
Might as well.

04:14.287 --> 04:17.824
You asked for
Lynn and Kylie?

04:17.824 --> 04:19.692
I didn't ask
for anybody.

04:19.692 --> 04:21.861
Why not?

04:21.861 --> 04:23.496
I don't know how.

04:23.496 --> 04:26.833
Abram says talking to it
doesn't do any good,

04:26.833 --> 04:28.868
plus I don't believe that
whoever's on the other end

04:28.868 --> 04:32.005
of this thing actually cares.

04:32.005 --> 04:35.675
Then why did you
come in here?

04:35.675 --> 04:37.677
Because I want to believe.

04:48.788 --> 04:52.291
Did you open
the weapon?

04:52.291 --> 04:56.029
I was going to ask you
the same thing.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.730
Abram wouldn't have.

04:57.730 --> 05:00.199
Not without telling us.

06:56.983 --> 06:59.051
You added something.

06:59.051 --> 07:00.787
Herbs.

07:00.787 --> 07:01.988
Don't ask me what they are.

07:01.988 --> 07:03.456
I have no idea.

07:03.456 --> 07:05.091
You put in random plants?

07:05.091 --> 07:06.526
They could be poisonous.

07:06.526 --> 07:09.428
The Obelisk would've
stopped me.

07:09.428 --> 07:10.363
Oh yes.

07:10.363 --> 07:13.099
The wise and powerful
Obelisk.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.100
I've already
eaten some.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.635
It didn't kill me.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.303
How comforting.

07:19.539 --> 07:21.541
Mmm.

07:28.548 --> 07:31.384
It's better though,
right?

07:31.384 --> 07:35.354
Yeah, it's not rib-eye steak,
but it's better.

07:35.354 --> 07:42.662
It's still gross, I know,
but it's a flavorful gross.

07:42.662 --> 07:45.331
We can't keep eating this
three times a day.

07:45.331 --> 07:47.500
Ezra went out hunting
this morning.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.769
If he has any luck,
we'll all eat better.

07:52.238 --> 07:53.639
Mmm.

07:53.639 --> 07:56.876
But in the meantime,
I'm a good chef though, right?

07:56.876 --> 08:00.313
I mean, making something
out of nothing!

08:20.466 --> 08:21.601
It was a rock.

08:21.601 --> 08:22.602
And you saw no one?

08:22.602 --> 08:25.771
Mm-mm.

08:25.771 --> 08:28.908
If you stole my food,
I'd hit you with a rock too.

08:28.908 --> 08:31.811
It doesn't matter that
it wasn't our snare.

08:31.811 --> 08:32.678
These are our woods.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.981
Anyone who hunts here
is a thief.

08:34.981 --> 08:36.282
Fine, then.

08:36.282 --> 08:37.650
Find this thief.

08:37.650 --> 08:38.284
Take Duncan.

08:38.284 --> 08:39.552
He's healthy now.

08:39.552 --> 08:41.087
What of the Reborns?

08:41.087 --> 08:43.489
This object they unearthed?

08:43.489 --> 08:44.790
It killed one of our own.

08:44.790 --> 08:48.628
The safety of our people is my
utmost concern as well, Jax.

08:48.628 --> 08:50.363
Once we send our brother
to the Ancestor,

08:50.363 --> 08:55.101
we will find this object
and destroy it.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.843
You think we should
open it more?

09:03.843 --> 09:05.444
Not without Ezra.

09:05.444 --> 09:06.579
D'you think
it's a bomb?

09:06.579 --> 09:07.880
Hope not.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.182
Well, it looks
like a bomb.

09:10.182 --> 09:14.287
Ezra said he dug it up
from the ground.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.522
So who put it there?

09:16.522 --> 09:17.924
Maybe no one.

09:17.924 --> 09:22.361
Maybe it was buried by time,
like those cars in the desert.

09:22.361 --> 09:25.464
So it's from the invasion?

09:25.464 --> 09:26.465
Maybe.

09:32.338 --> 09:33.506
What's it saying?

09:33.506 --> 09:35.474
Give me a second.

09:35.474 --> 09:38.477
I've never seen most of
these symbols before.

09:44.617 --> 09:46.285
You're to go to the lake.

09:48.154 --> 09:49.822
Alone.

09:49.822 --> 09:52.091
Why?

09:52.091 --> 09:54.260
They're giving us
more people.

09:56.495 --> 09:57.897
Maybe you should
wait for Ezra.

09:57.897 --> 09:59.165
That's not what
the Obelisk said.

09:59.165 --> 10:00.566
Since when do you
obey the Obelisk?

10:00.566 --> 10:01.567
It operates the
force field.

10:01.567 --> 10:02.868
That's reason enough
to obey it.

10:02.868 --> 10:04.036
Them, not it.

10:04.036 --> 10:05.338
The Obelisk is a
communication device,

10:05.338 --> 10:06.305
not the thing speaking.

10:06.305 --> 10:07.373
Whatever.

10:07.373 --> 10:09.208
Are you sure they didn't say
who they'd be giving us?

10:09.208 --> 10:11.510
You think I'd keep
that from you?

10:11.510 --> 10:12.611
You must know.

10:12.611 --> 10:14.513
You'll be depositing
the brain states.

10:16.182 --> 10:18.684
Sometimes he doesn't shut up
and sometimes he does that.

10:21.887 --> 10:23.489
If I bring him back
in four pieces,

10:23.489 --> 10:24.490
you know why.

10:24.490 --> 10:25.524
What if you need help?

10:25.524 --> 10:29.061
The Obelisk believes in me;
why don't you?

10:29.061 --> 10:31.263
See what you can find out
about that weapon...

10:31.263 --> 10:32.665
without blowing yourself up.

10:46.612 --> 10:49.682
Rabbit bones.

10:49.682 --> 10:51.250
Someone ate well.

10:51.250 --> 10:54.487
These tracks were
made by a child.

11:01.694 --> 11:03.329
It can't be a coincidence.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.430
I ask for Duncan,

11:04.430 --> 11:07.166
and then the Obelisk says
it's giving us more people.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.869
Seems cruel to give us
someone else.

11:11.937 --> 11:13.406
You have nothing to say?

11:13.406 --> 11:16.242
Not even, "I can neither
confirm nor deny."

11:17.710 --> 11:19.712
This is why people
dislike you.

11:43.335 --> 11:47.440
You can remove the lid.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.308
Okay.

12:05.758 --> 12:09.195
We're supposed to beat the
Skin Riders with this?

12:09.195 --> 12:10.529
To understand
the weapon,

12:10.529 --> 12:15.935
you must first understand
the Skin Rider parasite.

12:15.935 --> 12:19.238
Its brain contains over
100 billion nerve cells

12:19.238 --> 12:21.841
woven through an organic
crystalline structure.

12:21.841 --> 12:25.144
A crystal brain?

12:25.144 --> 12:26.212
Why does it glow?

12:26.212 --> 12:28.547
Due to the transference
of charged particles

12:28.547 --> 12:30.616
through the neural network.

12:30.616 --> 12:33.586
Basically, the light
means it's thinking.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.822
Not a very smart
evolutionary design.

12:36.822 --> 12:39.592
Light would attract
predators.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.528
Which is why human hosts
are instructed to cover and

12:42.528 --> 12:44.663
protect their parasite.

12:44.663 --> 12:45.531
Creepy.

12:45.531 --> 12:46.832
The light intensifies

12:46.832 --> 12:51.971
when one Skin Rider communicates
telepathically with another.

12:51.971 --> 12:54.673
They can read each
other's minds?

12:54.673 --> 12:55.608
No,

12:55.608 --> 12:57.676
but they can send
messages and information

12:57.676 --> 13:00.246
across short distances.

13:00.246 --> 13:01.914
How far a distance?

13:01.914 --> 13:03.582
A few hundred meters
at most.

13:08.187 --> 13:10.156
What does the weapon do?

13:10.156 --> 13:14.426
It breaks down the ionic bonds
and crystal lattices.

13:14.426 --> 13:15.628
It shatters the crystal.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.497
Like turning glass
into sand.

13:18.497 --> 13:21.901
The weapon is not intended for
individual Skin Riders, however;

13:21.901 --> 13:26.472
but rather,
for the Ancestor...

13:26.472 --> 13:31.443
A repository of all the memories
of their civilization.

13:31.443 --> 13:35.080
They store their memories
outside of their bodies?

13:35.080 --> 13:36.549
When a Skin Rider dies,

13:36.549 --> 13:39.952
the crystal is removed and then
added to the Ancestor so that

13:39.952 --> 13:43.289
the life and knowledge of that
Rider will forever be preserved.

13:43.289 --> 13:46.258
That's actually a
beautiful concept...

13:46.258 --> 13:50.863
In a horror movie
kind of way.

13:50.863 --> 13:52.865
Where is this Ancestor?

13:52.865 --> 13:54.867
Hidden somewhere near.

13:54.867 --> 13:58.537
You and the others
must find it and destroy it.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.417
Now what?

14:13.819 --> 14:15.621
Yeah.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.623
I'll just wait here, then.

14:38.711 --> 14:42.448
Whoever made these arrows gave
zero consideration to accuracy.

14:42.448 --> 14:44.650
I might as well be
throwing rocks.

14:48.354 --> 14:50.289
Should you be
messing with that?

14:50.289 --> 14:54.026
Yellow says it's safe.

14:54.026 --> 14:55.027
Where's Feena?

14:58.197 --> 15:01.834
Before you get angry,
hear me out.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.007
Lower the
force field.

15:08.007 --> 15:10.743
The instructions were
for Feena to go alone.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.144
I don't care what the
instructions were.

15:12.144 --> 15:13.412
Lower the force field.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.547
The Obelisk controls
the force field, Ezra,

15:15.547 --> 15:16.348
not me.

15:16.348 --> 15:18.083
Then tell the Obelisk
to let me out.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.818
I don't speak
to the Obelisk.

15:19.818 --> 15:22.021
Communication with them
is one-way.

15:22.021 --> 15:23.389
They speak to us.

15:23.389 --> 15:25.190
If there's a way to
send them a message,

15:25.190 --> 15:26.425
I don't know what it is.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.294
So we're trapped in here.

15:28.294 --> 15:29.161
Why?

15:29.161 --> 15:30.229
Perhaps the Obelisk

15:30.229 --> 15:32.431
does not want to endanger
more than one of you.

15:32.431 --> 15:35.301
One of those people out there
could be my wife or daughter.

15:35.301 --> 15:36.635
Feena is capable,

15:36.635 --> 15:39.371
or the Obelisk would not
have chosen her.

15:39.371 --> 15:40.673
And you're okay with this?

15:40.673 --> 15:42.041
I don't like it.

15:42.041 --> 15:43.909
They're giving us
more people.

15:43.909 --> 15:45.110
That's what matters.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.980
What matters is that we still
get to act like human beings.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.983
We lose that,
they haven't restored anything.

17:06.458 --> 17:08.093
HEY!

17:08.093 --> 17:12.731
Grab the rope!

17:14.333 --> 17:15.067
I got you.

17:15.067 --> 17:16.068
Come on.

17:24.143 --> 17:26.145
Come on.

17:26.145 --> 17:27.646
I've got you.

17:31.016 --> 17:33.018
Lynn?

17:33.018 --> 17:34.820
Are you hurt?

17:34.820 --> 17:36.021
No.

17:36.021 --> 17:37.956
No, I woke up
on the water.

17:37.956 --> 17:38.757
Ah!

17:38.757 --> 17:39.358
What?

17:39.358 --> 17:41.093
What is wrong with you?

17:42.561 --> 17:44.296
Verification complete.

17:44.296 --> 17:45.130
Welcome, Lynn.

17:49.768 --> 17:50.769
Are you all right?

17:50.769 --> 17:52.504
What was that?

17:52.504 --> 17:53.338
What happened?

17:53.338 --> 17:54.506
It's a long story.

17:54.506 --> 17:55.674
I'll let Ezra explain.

17:55.674 --> 17:56.308
Ezra?

17:56.308 --> 17:56.842
Your husband.

17:56.842 --> 17:57.643
Do you remember him?

17:57.643 --> 17:58.944
Yes, of course.

17:58.944 --> 18:00.846
Do you remember me?

18:00.846 --> 18:01.713
Have we met?

18:01.713 --> 18:02.915
Not like this.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.584
Your brain state doesn't
record new memories, apparently.

18:05.584 --> 18:06.518
My brain state?

18:06.518 --> 18:07.953
I'll explain later.

18:07.953 --> 18:08.921
I'm Feena.

18:08.921 --> 18:09.588
A friend.

18:09.588 --> 18:10.923
I'm here to help you.

18:13.392 --> 18:14.626
This is too easy.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.401
Collect the Sparks.

18:22.401 --> 18:26.872
Give them to me,
and I will let you live.

18:26.872 --> 18:28.974
I know you.

18:31.410 --> 18:31.910
Quickly!

18:31.910 --> 18:32.845
To the settlement.

18:32.845 --> 18:33.645
What about
the others?

18:33.645 --> 18:34.880
The Sparks won't
make others.

18:34.880 --> 18:35.280
Not now.

18:35.280 --> 18:35.681
Bu-

18:35.681 --> 18:36.482
Hurry!

18:36.482 --> 18:37.416
Come on!

18:57.603 --> 18:59.371
Duncan.

18:59.371 --> 19:00.272
You're alive-

19:02.107 --> 19:03.108
Are you all right?

19:09.147 --> 19:09.948
Run!

19:15.454 --> 19:15.854
This way.

19:15.854 --> 19:16.622
Ah!

19:27.699 --> 19:28.333
Come on!

19:28.333 --> 19:29.301
Ah!

19:29.301 --> 19:30.302
Get up.

19:32.571 --> 19:33.939
I can't keep up.
My foot-

19:33.939 --> 19:34.540
You have to.

19:34.540 --> 19:35.474
Come on!

19:35.474 --> 19:37.743
No, they'll catch us both
because of me.

19:37.743 --> 19:38.243
Here.

19:38.243 --> 19:38.877
Take my shoes.

19:38.877 --> 19:39.311
No!

19:39.311 --> 19:40.212
There's no time.

19:40.212 --> 19:41.046
How far is Ezra?

19:41.046 --> 19:42.014
A few miles.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.415
Go to him.
He'll come for me.

19:43.415 --> 19:45.150
I'm not leaving you.

19:45.150 --> 19:46.285
Yes, you are.

20:12.544 --> 20:13.845
A tranquilizer.

20:13.845 --> 20:18.183
How humane of your drone
to treat me like an animal.

20:22.788 --> 20:23.989
Where's the other one?

20:23.989 --> 20:25.023
Ran off.

20:25.023 --> 20:26.158
Then find her.

20:46.278 --> 20:47.512
Filtered rainwater.

21:03.829 --> 21:09.034
A man who shares his
waterskin shares his life.

21:09.034 --> 21:11.370
I don't even get
a thank-you.

21:12.537 --> 21:17.309
Perhaps the Sparks didn't
weave your brain properly.

21:17.309 --> 21:20.178
Wouldn't be the first time
they made a mistake, but,

21:20.178 --> 21:27.252
no, I think that stupid
arrogance is just who you are.

21:27.252 --> 21:28.854
What are Sparks?

21:28.854 --> 21:30.389
Ah.

21:30.389 --> 21:34.192
The little synapses
are firing after all.

21:34.192 --> 21:38.330
Sparks are water creatures.

21:38.330 --> 21:40.198
They made you.

21:40.198 --> 21:41.466
You were dead.

21:41.466 --> 21:44.069
Now you're not.

21:44.069 --> 21:47.472
Comes as a shock,
doesn't it?

21:47.472 --> 21:49.007
What do you mean,
"made me"?

21:49.007 --> 21:53.278
"Wove you" is
more accurate.

21:53.278 --> 21:57.315
From organic matter in
the water, air, stone.

21:57.315 --> 22:00.052
Neat trick, huh?

22:00.052 --> 22:01.219
That's not possible.

22:01.219 --> 22:01.953
No?

22:01.953 --> 22:04.690
Check yourself.

22:04.690 --> 22:08.894
Got any scars,
birthmarks, tattoos?

22:08.894 --> 22:11.096
Not anymore, you don't.

22:11.096 --> 22:16.501
You're the new and
improved Lynn.

22:16.501 --> 22:18.236
So you do remember me.

22:18.236 --> 22:21.640
My human does.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.109
But it's been a lot longer
than you think.

22:25.577 --> 22:29.981
Look around.

22:29.981 --> 22:33.251
Does it look like we're
still fighting the Karik?

22:33.251 --> 22:40.125
Do you hear any warships,
people screaming and dying?

22:40.125 --> 22:44.463
That's because the
invasion ended...

22:44.463 --> 22:46.465
four hundred years ago.

22:58.810 --> 23:01.880
Jameson, cover that corner!

23:22.234 --> 23:23.235
Help.

23:50.395 --> 23:52.664
The Karik won
that war.

23:52.664 --> 23:55.834
You humans went the way
of the dinosaurs.

23:55.834 --> 23:58.904
You say that like
you're not human.

23:58.904 --> 24:00.472
That surprises you.

24:00.472 --> 24:04.209
That's because humans
are arrogant.

24:04.209 --> 24:06.144
If it's intelligent,
if it can speak,

24:06.144 --> 24:08.280
you assume it must be human.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.414
You look human.

24:09.414 --> 24:10.415
Nobody's perfect.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.154
Then what are you?

24:16.154 --> 24:19.524
Impatient.

24:19.524 --> 24:24.629
Your feet are cut.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.531
Put them in the water.

24:26.531 --> 24:28.533
Keep them there.

24:42.848 --> 24:44.950
Don't move.

24:50.589 --> 24:52.023
They heal.

24:52.023 --> 24:57.329
If they find damaged tissue,
they mend it.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.797
They can even penetrate
your pores

24:58.797 --> 25:00.665
and repair strained muscles.

25:04.536 --> 25:05.871
See for yourself.

25:07.138 --> 25:09.407
The Reborns put them here.

25:09.407 --> 25:12.077
I want to collect them.

25:12.077 --> 25:13.612
They'll come to you...

25:13.612 --> 25:16.481
If your foot is bleeding.

25:16.481 --> 25:18.216
Cut it...

25:18.216 --> 25:19.885
Or I will.

25:43.108 --> 25:47.045
I wanted to wait
for you before.

25:47.045 --> 25:48.780
But if we would've,

25:48.780 --> 25:51.783
the force field would
have remained closed

25:51.783 --> 25:55.287
and neither you nor
Feena could have left.

25:55.287 --> 25:59.057
Is that what the
Obelisk told you?

25:59.057 --> 26:00.392
You think I'm
making this up?

26:00.392 --> 26:03.328
I think you're being
manipulated.

26:03.328 --> 26:05.196
Do you ever question
what they tell you?

26:05.196 --> 26:06.865
Consider what they're asking?

26:06.865 --> 26:11.169
If we disobey them,
there are consequences.

26:11.169 --> 26:13.772
Did the Obelisk
tell you that too?

26:13.772 --> 26:16.041
Or did you just
feel it?

26:19.611 --> 26:22.580
I don't know why they
picked me, all right?

26:22.580 --> 26:25.583
I don't know why I feel their
messages and you don't.

26:25.583 --> 26:26.785
Why they let me know things.

26:26.785 --> 26:29.287
But here's one thing
I know on my own:

26:29.287 --> 26:31.823
the human race is more
important than you.

26:31.823 --> 26:34.759
Or me, or your wife,
or any of us.

26:34.759 --> 26:36.161
And if they're trying
to preserve that,

26:36.161 --> 26:38.430
trying to restore
our species,

26:38.430 --> 26:42.167
then yeah,
I'm on their side.

26:42.167 --> 26:44.436
You can call it manipulation
or foolishness.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.638
Call it whatever you want.

26:46.638 --> 26:49.040
But it's not going to stop me
from doing whatever I can

26:49.040 --> 26:51.109
to bring back more people.

27:25.410 --> 27:27.812
Once you have
your companion,

27:27.812 --> 27:31.583
once we've opened your mind,
you'll understand.

27:31.583 --> 27:34.185
And you'll thank me.

27:45.096 --> 27:46.865
Wait!

28:04.315 --> 28:05.383
I don't understand.

28:05.383 --> 28:06.317
You want the cloth?

28:06.317 --> 28:08.086
Here.

28:08.086 --> 28:09.287
I don't know what you mean.

28:10.789 --> 28:12.757
You want me to
cover my eyes?

28:15.693 --> 28:18.596
This is a blindfold.

28:18.596 --> 28:20.932
I'm not going to
cover my eyes.

28:20.932 --> 28:22.867
All right, all right,
all right.

28:28.740 --> 28:29.407
Now what?

29:03.007 --> 29:04.676
Did you make this?

29:08.713 --> 29:11.116
For me?

29:11.116 --> 29:12.917
Thank you.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.790
Oh, they fit perfectly.

29:18.790 --> 29:21.059
You even have them
in my color.

29:26.464 --> 29:28.066
What do you think?

29:30.969 --> 29:32.470
Thank you.

29:44.215 --> 29:45.550
Mmm.

29:45.550 --> 29:47.485
It's good jerky.

29:50.421 --> 29:52.557
So where's your family?

29:52.557 --> 29:56.027
Do they live nearby?

29:56.027 --> 29:58.329
Do you not speak English?

29:58.329 --> 30:00.331
Espanol?

30:00.331 --> 30:02.967
Francais?

30:02.967 --> 30:04.302
Deutsch?

30:05.770 --> 30:07.572
I don't speak any
of those either,

30:07.572 --> 30:09.340
so it wouldn't
really help us.

30:11.376 --> 30:13.111
Do you have a name?

30:13.111 --> 30:16.247
My name is Lynn.

30:16.247 --> 30:17.815
Lynn.

30:17.815 --> 30:19.117
What's your name?

30:24.055 --> 30:27.225
My husband lives nearby
and I need to get to him.

30:27.225 --> 30:29.894
His name is Ezra.

30:29.894 --> 30:33.531
Do you know Ezra?

30:38.136 --> 30:40.138
My daughter would be
about your age.

31:07.632 --> 31:08.967
Does it always
take this long?

31:09.500 --> 31:12.971
Reconstituting a human body
is a delicate process.

31:12.971 --> 31:15.006
Are you going to tell me
to trust the Obelisk

31:15.006 --> 31:16.341
like Abram does?

31:16.341 --> 31:20.044
Abram isn't your enemy,
nor is the Obelisk.

31:20.044 --> 31:23.514
HEY!

31:23.514 --> 31:24.349
It's Feena.

31:24.349 --> 31:26.451
Open the gate!

31:35.860 --> 31:36.794
What happened?

31:36.794 --> 31:39.631
The Skin Riders took Lynn.

31:39.631 --> 31:40.431
Where?

31:40.431 --> 31:41.499
A creek near the lake.

31:41.499 --> 31:42.900
I tried to get her to come,

31:42.900 --> 31:45.103
but she stalled them
so I could get back to you.

31:45.103 --> 31:46.104
Can you take me there?

31:46.104 --> 31:46.638
Yeah.

31:50.008 --> 31:51.409
Take down the
force field.

31:51.409 --> 31:53.811
If someone is taken
by the Skin Riders, Ezra,

31:53.811 --> 31:55.146
they are taken.

31:55.146 --> 31:57.649
There is nothing
you can do about it.

32:00.084 --> 32:01.019
Yes, there is.

32:07.158 --> 32:08.359
What are you doing?

32:08.359 --> 32:10.094
Getting my wife.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.095
You think breaking the Obelisk

32:11.095 --> 32:12.830
is going to shut down
the force field?

32:12.830 --> 32:13.665
We'll find out.

32:13.665 --> 32:14.599
No, we won't.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.868
THINK for a second!

32:16.868 --> 32:18.836
You can't take on the
Skin Riders alone.

32:18.836 --> 32:19.771
She's my wife.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.205
And how're you
going to find her?

32:21.205 --> 32:23.007
You think they're waiting
for you at the creek?

32:23.007 --> 32:24.208
They're gone by now.

32:24.208 --> 32:25.209
Well, then,
I'll track 'em.

32:25.209 --> 32:27.011
And end up in their
hands as well.

32:27.011 --> 32:27.779
Don't you see?

32:27.779 --> 32:29.514
The Obelisk is
protecting you.

32:29.514 --> 32:30.715
Whose side are you on,
Abram?

32:30.715 --> 32:33.284
The side that doesn't want
to see you get killed

32:33.284 --> 32:37.121
without accomplishing anything.

32:37.121 --> 32:41.326
I won't allow you
to strike the Obelisk, Ezra.

32:41.326 --> 32:43.328
What, are you going to
shoot me with a dart?

32:43.328 --> 32:44.462
That's up to you.

32:50.201 --> 32:51.803
[sledgehammer clatters to floor]

32:51.803 --> 32:53.271
Where are
you going?

32:53.271 --> 32:55.340
To find another way out.

33:11.456 --> 33:14.292
That's a really good
impression.

33:14.292 --> 33:15.960
I love playing
with you,

33:15.960 --> 33:17.495
but I've got to
find my friends,

33:17.495 --> 33:18.896
so I can't stay he-

34:50.855 --> 34:51.656
Who are you?

34:51.656 --> 34:53.524
I'm a nurse.

34:53.524 --> 34:54.358
You were injured.

34:54.358 --> 34:56.127
I gave you something
for the pain.

34:56.127 --> 34:57.995
Red Hawk, this is-

34:57.995 --> 34:59.697
Where's my radio?

34:59.697 --> 35:02.834
I already tried.

35:02.834 --> 35:04.435
Red Hawk, Red Hawk,
this is Viper 6.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.137
Do you copy?

35:08.973 --> 35:09.807
Where are my men?

35:09.807 --> 35:10.875
There were four of us.

35:10.875 --> 35:13.211
The others are
in the corridor.

35:13.211 --> 35:17.315
You're the only one
that made it.

35:17.315 --> 35:19.617
So you moved me?

35:19.617 --> 35:24.155
They were coming.

35:24.155 --> 35:27.225
Thank you.

35:27.225 --> 35:28.426
There's shrapnel
in your leg.

35:28.426 --> 35:29.694
I need to remove it.

35:29.694 --> 35:31.295
I'm going to get back
to my unit.

35:31.295 --> 35:32.163
You're not going anywhere.

35:32.163 --> 35:33.331
There's a ship parked
right outside,

35:33.331 --> 35:35.633
not one of ours.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.101
We're stuck here for now.

35:43.774 --> 35:45.042
How bad is the leg?

35:45.042 --> 35:49.113
If I don't treat it now,
you'll lose it.

35:49.113 --> 35:50.181
All right.

35:50.181 --> 35:52.216
Do what you need to do.

35:52.583 --> 35:54.352
You lost a lot of blood.

35:54.352 --> 35:55.953
This isn't the best way
to do this,

35:55.953 --> 35:57.388
but we're sort of
short on options.

35:57.388 --> 35:58.723
You're giving me
your own?

35:58.723 --> 35:59.724
We're the same blood type.

35:59.724 --> 36:00.391
I already checked.

36:00.391 --> 36:01.359
Isn't this a clinic?

36:01.359 --> 36:02.360
Don't they have
blood here?

36:02.360 --> 36:04.328
I don't know how long
the power's been out.

36:04.328 --> 36:07.064
I can't radiate it before
I give it to you, but...

36:07.064 --> 36:10.101
I assure you,
I'm clean.

36:10.101 --> 36:12.403
I'm not worried about that,
ma'am.

36:12.403 --> 36:13.404
It's Lynn.

36:20.077 --> 36:22.513
Thank you, Lynn.

36:33.224 --> 36:34.625
Okay.

36:34.625 --> 36:37.228
Okay, give me a sec!

36:37.228 --> 36:40.798
I'm not as young as you.

36:42.333 --> 36:44.101
Is this the way
to your people?

36:47.905 --> 36:49.907
I hope you know
where you're going.

36:57.782 --> 36:58.783
Oh!

37:26.711 --> 37:27.712
Jax!

37:38.089 --> 37:39.890
We lost her.

37:39.890 --> 37:41.158
Tracked her for
a couple miles,

37:41.158 --> 37:43.861
but she slipped through.

37:43.861 --> 37:45.930
She'll be back at the
settlement by now.

37:53.704 --> 37:55.840
I don't need a weapon
to kill you.

37:55.840 --> 38:00.378
You're like children!

38:00.378 --> 38:06.117
I'm tempted to let you two
kill each other.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.719
You found your thief?

38:08.719 --> 38:10.121
I see.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.123
So you've accomplished
nothing.

38:19.530 --> 38:22.566
The day wasn't a
total waste, then.

38:22.566 --> 38:23.601
Ah.

38:23.601 --> 38:27.071
Nice to see someone
taking the initiative.

38:27.071 --> 38:30.274
Is it operative?

38:30.274 --> 38:32.610
It will require
s-some repairs.

38:34.945 --> 38:36.947
Because you didn't think
to subdue it gently?

38:41.786 --> 38:44.622
Have enough sense at least
to get out of the rain.

38:44.622 --> 38:45.990
No.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.992
Not until I have
what I came for.

38:51.062 --> 38:52.930
Careful, Jax.

38:52.930 --> 38:54.899
Judging by that head wound,

38:54.899 --> 38:57.635
you're not the only predator
in the woods today.

39:12.717 --> 39:15.853
There isn't
another way out.

39:15.853 --> 39:19.990
The force field is a sphere
with the Obelisk at the center.

39:19.990 --> 39:23.360
You're sure?

39:23.360 --> 39:25.796
This wall is the same distance
from the Obelisk

39:25.796 --> 39:28.265
as the force field
beyond the gate is.

39:28.265 --> 39:31.368
Couldn't dig our way out of here
if we wanted to.

39:35.172 --> 39:36.173
It's my fault.

39:43.447 --> 39:44.849
I didn't want to wait for you

39:44.849 --> 39:48.686
because I thought if we
went against the Obelisk,

39:48.686 --> 39:52.823
it wouldn't
give us Duncan.

39:52.823 --> 39:55.559
But he's already alive.

39:55.559 --> 39:57.428
He's a Skin Rider.

39:57.428 --> 39:59.597
Like your brother.

39:59.597 --> 40:02.967
He looked at me
like he didn't know me.

40:02.967 --> 40:07.004
And now that's going to
happen to Lynn because of me.

40:07.004 --> 40:08.639
You can't blame yourself,
Feena.

40:08.639 --> 40:10.508
I'm the one who
left her out there.

40:10.508 --> 40:13.010
And you did what
she told you to do.

40:13.010 --> 40:18.015
Believe me, it's never
a good idea to defy Lynn.

40:18.015 --> 40:20.384
I'm going to help you
get her back.

40:20.384 --> 40:21.786
We're going to
help each other.

40:53.017 --> 40:54.752
What happened?

40:54.752 --> 40:55.986
I had to put you under.

40:55.986 --> 40:57.721
Removing shrapnel
doesn't really go well

40:57.721 --> 40:59.890
when the patient is awake.

40:59.890 --> 41:02.426
You say that like
you've done this before.

41:02.426 --> 41:06.096
I've helped with a few
hundred trauma surgeries.

41:06.096 --> 41:09.433
I'm lucky you were around,
then.

41:09.433 --> 41:12.703
What were you doing in here,
anyway?

41:12.703 --> 41:16.507
My husband needs
medication.

41:16.507 --> 41:17.775
Did you find
what you needed?

41:17.775 --> 41:21.178
Not exactly,
but it might work.

41:21.178 --> 41:22.313
Hopefully.

41:22.313 --> 41:26.650
If you tend to him half as
well as you tended to me,

41:26.650 --> 41:27.985
he'll be okay.

41:30.421 --> 41:31.388
What about you?

41:31.388 --> 41:33.791
You married?

41:33.791 --> 41:35.759
Yeah, nine days ago.

41:35.759 --> 41:36.794
Really?

41:36.794 --> 41:41.932
We were all set for our
honeymoon and then...

41:41.932 --> 41:43.133
this.

41:43.634 --> 41:45.636
I haven't heard from her
since they called me in.

41:48.472 --> 41:51.208
You got kids?

41:51.208 --> 41:52.877
A daughter.

41:52.877 --> 41:54.178
She's five.

41:54.178 --> 41:58.616
No kid should ever have
to experience this.

41:58.616 --> 41:59.817
Doesn't seem fair.

41:59.817 --> 42:03.087
No, it doesn't.

42:04.321 --> 42:05.556
What are they telling you?

42:05.556 --> 42:07.858
We don't have any reception
where we are.

42:07.858 --> 42:09.560
Nobody gets reception.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.629
Not anymore.

42:11.629 --> 42:13.631
Believe me,
it's a mercy.

42:13.631 --> 42:16.066
Why?
What's happening?

42:16.066 --> 42:20.337
You stay close to your
husband and daughter, Lynn.

42:20.337 --> 42:24.375
Enjoy that as long
as you can.

42:31.916 --> 42:35.653
How do I talk to you?

42:35.653 --> 42:43.994
How do I convey
what we need to say?

42:43.994 --> 42:47.531
You have to be a machine,
but there are no keys,

42:47.531 --> 42:52.236
no buttons.

42:52.236 --> 42:56.674
We are breaking apart here.

42:56.674 --> 42:59.743
And it's because of you.

42:59.743 --> 43:02.813
If you aren't going to allow us
to do what we have to do,

43:02.813 --> 43:04.815
why bother bringing us back?

43:09.486 --> 43:12.089
This means community.

43:12.089 --> 43:14.992
You taught me that.

43:14.992 --> 43:18.796
Don't you value that?

43:21.165 --> 43:22.566
Community.

43:22.566 --> 43:24.568
Yes.

43:24.568 --> 43:28.872
That- That woman is one of us.

43:28.872 --> 43:33.811
We cannot abandon her.

43:41.251 --> 43:45.189
Mercy.

43:45.189 --> 43:49.927
It is Ezra's wife.

43:49.927 --> 43:54.665
Have mercy on him!

43:54.665 --> 43:58.202
And her.

44:02.039 --> 44:07.277
Does-
Does this mean...

44:07.277 --> 44:09.613
You hear me?

44:11.815 --> 44:13.550
Or are you...

44:13.550 --> 44:18.088
just repeating what I say?

44:26.764 --> 44:28.399
You all right?

44:31.602 --> 44:33.237
No, she isn't.

44:37.908 --> 44:39.376
She's a reject.

44:39.376 --> 44:41.178
The Sparks don't get it right
every time, Lynn.

44:41.178 --> 44:43.781
It doesn't happen often,
but it happens.

44:43.781 --> 44:46.917
They build the brain wrong
or the vocal chords wrong.

44:46.917 --> 44:48.952
And drones won't tell you
the hard truth of it,

44:48.952 --> 44:49.987
so I will.

44:49.987 --> 44:52.356
You're nothing to them.

44:52.356 --> 44:54.858
Nothing to the Obelisk,
nothing to the Makers.

44:54.858 --> 44:57.861
All they want
is a tool.

44:57.861 --> 45:01.732
And if that tool dies,
they won't bring it back again.

45:01.732 --> 45:03.934
Even if it's your wife.

45:03.934 --> 45:06.103
Even if you beg.

45:06.103 --> 45:07.871
Even if her death
was their fault

45:07.871 --> 45:11.075
because to them,
she's just a tool.

45:11.075 --> 45:15.345
Used and discarded.

45:15.345 --> 45:16.280
Let the girl go.

45:16.280 --> 45:17.781
That girl is a nuisance.

45:17.781 --> 45:19.583
The drones and the Sparks
don't show her mercy,

45:19.583 --> 45:20.818
but this is how you do?

45:20.818 --> 45:24.088
Don't lecture me
like you know me.

45:24.088 --> 45:28.092
I did know you once.

45:28.092 --> 45:30.360
I'll help you gather the Sparks
if you let her go.

45:30.360 --> 45:31.962
I can catch you
both anyway.

45:34.198 --> 45:35.866
Not easily.

45:38.702 --> 45:42.706
I like how you negotiate.

45:42.706 --> 45:48.378
Go away, girl,
before I change my minds.

45:48.378 --> 45:49.379
Take this.

45:49.379 --> 45:50.247
Don't look back.

45:50.247 --> 45:52.249
Go, go!

45:52.249 --> 45:54.284
You just lost your
negotiating tool.

45:54.284 --> 45:56.620
You lost the ability
to cut my feet.

45:58.455 --> 46:00.991
Come peacefully...

46:00.991 --> 46:04.862
and we'll leave the Sparks
for now.

46:38.562 --> 46:39.329
Over here!

46:39.329 --> 46:40.297
Sergeant!
You two.

46:40.297 --> 46:43.500
Over here!

46:45.335 --> 46:47.437
Red Hawk,
this is 2-1-Alpha...

46:47.437 --> 46:48.105
Hey.

46:55.846 --> 46:57.714
Ezra!

46:57.714 --> 46:58.849
Lynn?

47:02.653 --> 47:05.889
I got what we needed.

47:14.164 --> 47:15.599
The humans
killed our brother

47:15.599 --> 47:19.136
with one touch
of their weapon.

47:19.136 --> 47:23.941
We offer them a companion
to choose for them,

47:23.941 --> 47:28.579
to remove from them the burden
of discipline and self-mastery,

47:28.579 --> 47:31.481
guilt and shame.

47:31.481 --> 47:36.687
We offer them guaranteed joy
and they give us this.

47:48.432 --> 47:51.568
This brother will
not be forgotten.

47:51.568 --> 47:54.438
His memories will
not be discarded.

47:54.438 --> 47:56.106
His light will not
be diminished.

48:02.379 --> 48:08.652
With this knife,
I remove his crystal.

48:11.788 --> 48:14.091
Who will carry him
to the Ancestor?

48:14.091 --> 48:15.892
Who will honor him?

48:15.892 --> 48:18.195
Preserve him?

48:18.195 --> 48:20.397
Add him to the past?

48:26.737 --> 48:32.609
May your feet be swift
and your minds be clear.

48:44.121 --> 48:45.956
Hello, Lynn.

48:45.956 --> 48:47.691
I'm so glad you could come.

48:52.429 --> 48:56.767
Whoa, you're-
You're going too fast.

48:56.767 --> 48:58.869
I-I need to-
I need to write these down.

48:58.869 --> 49:00.170
I can't learn that quickly.

50:03.734 --> 50:05.335
I'm going to ask that
whatever harsh feelings

50:05.335 --> 50:06.970
you have for me

50:06.970 --> 50:08.905
be set aside
for a moment.

50:12.776 --> 50:14.845
I'm making progress
with the Obelisk.

50:14.845 --> 50:16.113
I can write to them.

50:16.113 --> 50:17.247
They're simple messages.

50:17.247 --> 50:19.649
I can't articulate
what I want to say,

50:19.649 --> 50:20.817
but with a little study,

50:20.817 --> 50:23.019
I might be able to
ask them to let us out.

50:23.019 --> 50:25.655
They don't have time
for more study, Abram.

50:25.655 --> 50:27.391
If they infected Lynn,

50:27.391 --> 50:29.526
the parasite
takes root quickly.

50:29.526 --> 50:30.794
There's something else.

50:34.931 --> 50:38.935
I found this notebook
left by the settlers.

50:38.935 --> 50:40.270
Crude paper.

50:40.270 --> 50:43.673
They must've
made it somehow.

50:43.673 --> 50:44.674
Okay.

50:46.743 --> 50:48.545
See all these notes?

50:48.545 --> 50:50.147
All these pages?

50:50.147 --> 50:51.248
Yeah.

50:51.248 --> 50:53.550
This is my handwriting.

50:53.550 --> 50:54.885
My shorthand.

50:54.885 --> 50:56.987
That I created.

50:56.987 --> 50:58.555
And...

50:58.555 --> 51:01.758
I don't remember
writing it.

51:01.758 --> 51:02.826
What are you saying?

51:02.826 --> 51:07.230
I'm saying I've been
here before, Ezra.

51:07.230 --> 51:08.765
I was one of the settlers.
