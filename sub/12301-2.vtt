WEBVTT

00:25.591 --> 00:28.446
Draw me the line.

00:30.874 --> 00:32.256
Nice toss, champ.

00:34.715 --> 00:36.229
It's stuck.

00:39.260 --> 00:40.939
Oh, my god!

00:43.141 --> 00:45.216
Apparently, somebody hit a bull's eye.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.310
A spear.

01:00.895 --> 01:03.274
Slip is rented to a Paul Jackson.

01:03.443 --> 01:06.637
Marina captain says Paul
just signed a lease two days ago.

01:07.408 --> 01:09.777
Okay. mostly it's a brand new boat.

01:09.969 --> 01:11.650
Yeah, I'll see if I can track down the dealer.

01:11.650 --> 01:12.980
Okay. Keep me posted.

01:12.980 --> 01:14.729
Least he went out in style.

01:15.020 --> 01:16.194
New boat,

01:16.483 --> 01:17.371
new gear.

01:17.543 --> 01:18.782
Top-shelf tequila.

01:18.782 --> 01:21.866
Yes, tequila for one.
so he wasn't expecting company.

01:22.746 --> 01:26.591
A spear, so he's either a deep sea diver,
or knows one.

01:26.591 --> 01:27.906
No spearguns on the vessel.

01:27.906 --> 01:29.787
so the suspect must have
brought it in with him.

01:29.787 --> 01:32.107
Brought in and took it away.

01:32.107 --> 01:34.559
Neighbors, harbor patrol.
Nobody saw a thing.

01:35.091 --> 01:36.668
MOrning, ladies and gentlemen.

01:36.668 --> 01:37.956
Good morning, Alex.

01:39.097 --> 01:40.606
Can I take him off your hands?

01:40.606 --> 01:41.824
He's all yours.

01:42.073 --> 01:44.239
I am going to find

01:45.202 --> 01:46.731
the one that got away.

02:27.490 --> 02:29.765
MIAMI
2x02 Dead Zone

02:35.525 --> 02:37.634
So, our victim takes the spear.

02:41.972 --> 02:44.722
.. and blood pools around his feet.

02:44.722 --> 02:45.805
speed?

02:50.214 --> 02:51.596
Void in the blood pool.

02:52.062 --> 02:53.765
rectangular with a peak.

02:54.486 --> 02:55.992
could a lead diving weight.

02:56.524 --> 03:00.615
Yes. whatever it was caused ridges to
form in the blood within minutes. Right?

03:00.615 --> 03:02.396
and whoever removed it...

03:05.778 --> 03:07.619
Watched this man die.

03:11.230 --> 03:13.071
Hey, H. I'm seeing some
salvage gear in here.

03:13.071 --> 03:16.615
high-end scanners... things like this.
all still in the boxes.

03:16.615 --> 03:21.525
Salvager, Well it'd take an awful lot of
used tin to afford a boat like this.

03:21.719 --> 03:22.872
Okay. Here's what we need to do.

03:22.872 --> 03:24.165
Let's find out who

03:24.398 --> 03:25.985
and what...

03:26.278 --> 03:27.462
was here.

03:27.846 --> 03:28.763
All right?

03:35.561 --> 03:38.967
Naked guy, boat hull and spear.

03:39.206 --> 03:40.996
Not something you see everyday.

03:40.996 --> 03:42.768
And they say guns are dangerous.

03:43.004 --> 03:44.628
got some transfer here.

03:45.343 --> 03:46.714
that looks like fish scales.

03:48.316 --> 03:51.378
Transfer probably occurred.
as the spear passed through the torso.

03:54.157 --> 03:55.866
The blades will have better samples.

03:56.485 --> 03:58.012
GiVe me a hand, Calleigh, please.

04:13.886 --> 04:16.507
Thanks.
I'll be in Firearms.

04:16.697 --> 04:20.951
Velocity, tool marks... somewhere there's
speargun out there that goes with this spear.

04:37.298 --> 04:38.522
What?

04:38.522 --> 04:41.042
You got a new boat and a used toilet.

04:41.459 --> 04:42.710
The seat's up.

04:43.883 --> 04:45.584
Why does it always get to be the toilet?

05:07.568 --> 05:09.407
Cause of death.
massive internal damage.

05:09.407 --> 05:11.931
The spear perforated the liver
and abdominal aorta.

05:11.931 --> 05:17.102
X ray showed small linear fracture.
definitely perimortem.

05:17.102 --> 05:21.995
And finally, the extremities.
Irritation on the hands and forearms.

05:22.299 --> 05:24.371
We think he could be a salvager.

05:24.371 --> 05:26.420
So he got this in the water.

05:29.928 --> 05:34.268
Jellyfish? / Possibly, but take a look
at these cuts inside the welts.

05:34.268 --> 05:36.210
I'm thinking fire coral.

05:36.451 --> 05:38.931
Jellyfish and fire coral are cousins.

05:39.181 --> 05:41.215
If he scraped against the fire coral

05:43.031 --> 05:44.867
it'd release nematocysts.

05:48.248 --> 05:49.950
Stings just like a jellyfish.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.554
Welts usually last a day.

05:51.554 --> 05:53.833
So he's been underwater
in the last 24 hours.

05:53.833 --> 05:55.507
How about this black chemical?

05:55.839 --> 05:57.341
Has that sent to Trace?

05:57.341 --> 05:59.776
Yeah. Looks like fingerprint ink.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.069
I was thinking maybe he's
been in the system this week.

06:02.269 --> 06:05.094
Or down deep, touching something silver.

06:05.342 --> 06:07.120
Well, you said he was a salvager.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.586
Tin? / No, not tin.

06:09.586 --> 06:11.472
Silver, as in silver coins

06:11.472 --> 06:15.344
They react to the salt water.
and break down into black sulfide.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.178
You know what this guy is.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.566
This guy is a treasure hunter.

06:21.834 --> 06:22.864
Treasure hunting, huh?

06:22.864 --> 06:24.162
There's a good chance.

06:24.162 --> 06:27.098
Makes sense.
It's a $2 billion business in Florida.

06:27.098 --> 06:28.081
hunting for treasure.

06:28.081 --> 06:30.226
All that hope for a little
stretch of coastline.

06:30.226 --> 06:33.154
I assume you want me to get in touch
with the State Archaeology unit.

06:33.154 --> 06:36.975
Let's find out what quadrant
Mr. Paul Jackson leased, okay?

06:37.566 --> 06:41.341
Paul Jackson didn't own his own boat.
let alone his own quadrant.

06:41.341 --> 06:42.493
So he had a boss.

06:42.493 --> 06:45.360
Yeah, Marty Jones...
who isn't really boss material.

06:45.360 --> 06:47.991
But he has a working vessel and
that's all you need.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.203
That and lease rights.

06:49.203 --> 06:51.182
So you gave this Marty a quadrant?

06:51.182 --> 06:53.245
Yeah. Florida Marine Archaelogy Regs.

06:53.245 --> 06:54.373
Two miles by one.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.429
Can you tell us where exactly that is?

06:56.429 --> 06:58.391
Badge'll get you anything.

07:00.544 --> 07:01.827
You work for the State.

07:01.827 --> 07:05.126
So even if Paul found treasure
it would've belonged to Marty, right?

07:05.126 --> 07:08.002
And the State of Florida.
They have to split with us, 80/20.

07:08.002 --> 07:10.144
And the State still gets to
choose which 20?

07:10.656 --> 07:13.121
You hunt. / A little bit.
When I was a kid,

07:13.121 --> 07:17.828
I, uh.. my big plan was to find enough gold
to bring the rest of my family over from Cuba.

07:17.828 --> 07:20.065
but I, uh, never got that lucky.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.461
Any chances Marty and
Paul didn't report a find?

07:22.461 --> 07:25.704
oh, no. That's not them. When Marty
and Paulie found something,

07:25.704 --> 07:28.394
they were like kids coming
to register it in my office.

07:28.394 --> 07:30.796
Even though the stuff was
a step above junk.

07:30.796 --> 07:32.399
Nostalgia pieces.

07:32.399 --> 07:33.893
Like my Penelope.

07:33.893 --> 07:35.110
Who's that?

07:35.110 --> 07:37.882
British freighter, sank in '42.

07:38.048 --> 07:40.564
The only wreck I ever arrested.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.798
SO you never got anything
good from her, huh?

07:42.971 --> 07:44.483
Bragging rights.

07:46.713 --> 07:48.506
There's a second name on this map.

07:48.708 --> 07:50.258
"Bret Betancourt"

07:50.258 --> 07:52.075
Oh, yeah. Investor.

07:52.075 --> 07:53.554
Probably a silent partner.

07:53.616 --> 07:55.758
Is there any address
besides a P.O. box?

07:56.033 --> 07:57.728
No. Sorry.

07:59.408 --> 08:01.895
So this Betancourt is
an honorary treasure hunter.

08:01.895 --> 08:03.877
He's been throwing his money
at our spearing victim

08:03.877 --> 08:07.166
and his partner Marty for years.
State says they never found a thing.

08:07.166 --> 08:09.276
Okay, and Yelina is after this Marty.

08:09.276 --> 08:10.575
Yeah, and Betancourt.

08:10.575 --> 08:12.452
No luck so far. / Okay,

08:12.594 --> 08:14.724
if you want to find out where someone
is find out where they have been.

08:14.724 --> 08:16.913
Marine life, quadrant.

08:17.052 --> 08:20.403
Right. So we know that our victim
has been near fire coral.

08:20.403 --> 08:22.159
but that covers half the coast of Florida.

08:22.159 --> 08:26.186
Yes, but there is only one species
that's found at depth of 80 feet.

08:26.186 --> 08:27.830
That's Millepora alcicornis.

08:27.830 --> 08:29.431
Which is the kind that stung our victim.

08:29.431 --> 08:32.192
Exactly, and that narrows it
down to two reef sections.

08:32.192 --> 08:34.751
the Muldoons and the Cortez Trench.

08:35.018 --> 08:36.477
Cortez Trench.

08:36.477 --> 08:39.139
Okay, here's what we do. Let's start
with the trench and you suit up.

08:39.139 --> 08:40.390
YOu're going treasure hunting.

08:48.270 --> 08:50.560
Delko, you have 22 minutes of air left.

08:50.560 --> 08:51.810
Copy.

08:53.843 --> 08:56.856
Somebody was definitely
down here before us.

09:12.346 --> 09:13.973
I see something.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.603
What have you got?

09:22.963 --> 09:24.683
Delko, do you read?

09:25.202 --> 09:26.861
Over.

09:29.693 --> 09:31.506
Delko? Talk to me.

09:43.954 --> 09:45.240
Let me see that camera.

09:45.549 --> 09:46.763
What did you find?

09:47.471 --> 09:49.321
I swear I saw a mermaid.

09:50.973 --> 09:52.569
Dream on, diver man.

09:54.814 --> 09:56.787
Got a vacuum nozzle.

09:57.392 --> 09:59.445
How much disturbance
was down there?

09:59.639 --> 10:01.932
- I don't remember.
- Okay. How deep were you?

10:02.361 --> 10:03.847
I don't know.. uh...

10:04.322 --> 10:05.790
110 feet.

10:05.930 --> 10:07.024
Narcosis.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.598
Yeah. nitrogen levels are
triple at that depth.

10:09.795 --> 10:11.478
No wonder why I felt like I was drunk.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.588
Could explain why you
thought you saw a mermaid.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.538
He did see a mermaid.

10:15.758 --> 10:16.789
See?

10:16.879 --> 10:18.028
Take a look at that.

10:18.957 --> 10:20.433
You recognize her?

10:21.400 --> 10:22.580
Yeah.

10:22.791 --> 10:24.154
That's it. That's what I saw.

10:26.639 --> 10:27.854
Oh, my god.

10:36.650 --> 10:37.723
Okay.

10:38.700 --> 10:39.783
One down.

10:39.783 --> 10:43.038
So what do you do?
just go to lostfigureheads. com?

10:43.038 --> 10:45.178
Uh, there's no record for
most figureheads,

10:45.178 --> 10:48.100
but these four ships were
the Titanics of their century.

10:51.380 --> 10:52.564
There it is.

10:52.728 --> 10:54.075
She's that figurhead for

10:54.075 --> 10:56.485
La Nuestra Senora de Zaragoza.

10:56.485 --> 10:58.865
- A Spanish galleon.
- The Spanish galleon.

10:58.865 --> 11:00.300
Female saints are on the bow
for good luck.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.824
That's clearly not a foolproof strategy.

11:02.824 --> 11:04.438
The Zaragoza's legend.

11:04.438 --> 11:08.358
Documented to have capsized in 1649
with Spain's greatest riches in its hull.

11:08.358 --> 11:09.700
So, will you define riches?

11:09.700 --> 11:12.562
God, silver, art, jewels...

11:12.562 --> 11:14.796
She went down just off the coast
during a hurricane

11:14.796 --> 11:17.260
When Miami was still known
as Tequesta.

11:17.260 --> 11:20.610
So hurricane Andrew shifted sands
and revealed this wreck.

11:21.086 --> 11:23.481
Let's finish what Andrew started.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.144
Our victim's dive partner Marty Jones.

11:32.144 --> 11:34.115
A statie spotted him
on the side of road.

11:34.115 --> 11:35.156
Cracked radiator.

11:35.156 --> 11:37.312
Heading north or south? / Key west.

11:37.559 --> 11:39.434
Ah, yes.. the end of the line.

11:39.434 --> 11:41.527
Oh, uh, one more thing.

11:41.774 --> 11:43.147
He wears a prosthetic device.

11:43.147 --> 11:45.864
Says it's against the civil rights
to make him remove it.

11:45.864 --> 11:47.627
State Patrol wasn't sure of the protocol.

11:47.627 --> 11:49.735
Well, let's clarify it for them.

11:53.788 --> 11:55.922
Scares little kids and law enforcement.

11:56.468 --> 11:57.587
My hook.

11:57.687 --> 11:58.921
Just like a pirate, huh?

12:00.556 --> 12:03.278
Yeah. She ain't too good with pliers.

12:03.527 --> 12:04.982
I love my hook.

12:05.586 --> 12:07.422
I love her. / But the problem, Marty

12:07.422 --> 12:10.764
is that your hook is
a potential weapon for us.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.655
so we're going to ask you
to relinquish it, please.

12:14.867 --> 12:16.165
Now, you know...

12:17.628 --> 12:20.042
He's the first one with a badge
to ever to ask nice.

12:28.345 --> 12:29.548
Here we go.

12:32.395 --> 12:33.949
Trade you a hook for a light.

12:35.073 --> 12:36.873
Sorry. I can't do that.

12:39.936 --> 12:42.439
So tell me What happened.
What's this all about?

12:42.439 --> 12:43.998
Your dive partner's dead.

12:43.998 --> 12:45.421
What, Paulie?

12:45.608 --> 12:46.723
And then you left town.

12:46.723 --> 12:49.390
which make us think
you have something to do with it.

12:50.677 --> 12:52.302
No, no, no. No way.

12:52.302 --> 12:54.049
I went off on a fishing trip.

12:54.049 --> 12:55.881
I haven't see Paulie in a week.

12:55.881 --> 12:57.920
Down to the Keys, I understand.

12:58.771 --> 13:01.565
This is a photograph of
your brand of cigar,

13:01.565 --> 13:04.708
which puts you on Paulie's
two-day-old-boat.

13:04.927 --> 13:06.362
You were there.

13:08.905 --> 13:10.793
Yeah. Well.

13:11.027 --> 13:12.306
Paulie called me.

13:12.306 --> 13:13.883
Said he needed to talk.

13:14.134 --> 13:15.374
I go over.

13:15.374 --> 13:17.531
He keeps beating aroud the bush.

13:17.704 --> 13:20.054
Oh, so, I.. I go to the head.

13:20.503 --> 13:22.342
had a smoke.

13:22.342 --> 13:24.729
and that's when I heard
somebody else on board.

13:32.915 --> 13:34.634
Somebody else?
Who are we talking about?

13:37.009 --> 13:38.413
You know...

13:39.276 --> 13:41.660
your people must think
I'm a real bastard or something.

13:42.033 --> 13:43.600
keeping quiet.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.571
but I didn't want to lose my financing.

13:46.723 --> 13:48.889
I mean, I love Pauli and all, but

13:48.889 --> 13:51.988
I gotta tell you...
I love treasure-hunting more.

13:52.168 --> 13:54.019
So how would you lose financing?

13:54.497 --> 13:55.884
Bret Betancourt.

13:55.994 --> 13:57.362
Your silent partner.

13:57.696 --> 13:59.366
Funds all your treasure divers.

13:59.366 --> 14:01.235
And kills my dive partner.

14:01.848 --> 14:04.681
- He didn't know I saw him kill Paulie.
- Okay, but wait.

14:04.681 --> 14:07.171
- You're saying you witnessed murder.
- That's right.

14:07.171 --> 14:08.903
I wasn't about to tell him, either.

14:09.078 --> 14:11.148
So I booked down to the Keys.

14:13.143 --> 14:17.518
Marty, if you witnessed murder,
that means you were definitely there.

14:17.518 --> 14:19.973
Tell me what you think created that void.

14:19.973 --> 14:22.269
Don't know. Betancourt went
down for something.

14:22.269 --> 14:24.757
but his body blocked me.
I couldn't see what it was.

14:33.788 --> 14:37.611
Okay. well.. I think we can all agree
that that is a whale of a tail, Marty.

14:37.611 --> 14:40.693
Detective Salas is gonna take
some addresses from you now.

14:40.693 --> 14:43.875
Home, boat slip, storage units.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.239
I'm not hiding anything.

14:45.239 --> 14:46.724
Mi casa es su casa, huh?

14:46.724 --> 14:48.216
Not even treasure?

14:56.276 --> 14:58.487
You guys found treasure in our quadrant.

14:59.603 --> 15:01.731
Is that what this is really about?

15:01.809 --> 15:02.857
No.

15:03.508 --> 15:05.149
This is really about murder.

15:51.209 --> 15:52.668
Could be a million dollars' worth of gold.

15:52.668 --> 15:53.676
Is that all of it?

15:53.676 --> 15:54.767
No, sir.

15:54.767 --> 15:56.682
It'll take another ten trips
to get the mother lode,

15:56.682 --> 15:58.730
and that's with the best equipment
the Coast guard has.

15:58.730 --> 16:00.019
Two men couldn't get it all.

16:00.019 --> 16:00.924
even in a week.

16:00.924 --> 16:02.916
Bet our guys got some of it, though.

16:02.916 --> 16:06.351
Judging from the disturbance
they got away with a small fortune.

16:06.351 --> 16:10.335
Okay, so we've a marine archaeologist
and a shipwreck conservationist on board.

16:10.335 --> 16:12.648
What do you think?
Is this treasure they find?

16:12.648 --> 16:15.964
or evidence? / Related to murder,
we get first shot.

16:31.069 --> 16:32.218
Nice form.

16:32.573 --> 16:33.615
Hey.

16:34.587 --> 16:35.770
But weak follow-through.

16:35.770 --> 16:38.637
There is absolutely nothing wrong
with my follow-through, Detective.

16:38.637 --> 16:40.031
It's this speargun that lacks tension.

16:40.031 --> 16:41.823
It doesn't have enough
to make it through the gel block.

16:41.823 --> 16:43.146
let alone the hull.

16:43.146 --> 16:45.054
Try something with more punch.

16:45.493 --> 16:47.972
How did I ever do my job
before I met you?

16:52.915 --> 16:54.196
Okay.

16:54.408 --> 16:55.935
This one...

16:56.836 --> 16:58.433
has an extra..

16:59.189 --> 17:01.127
120 pounds

17:01.410 --> 17:03.066
of thrust.

17:03.250 --> 17:04.756
It's compact,

17:04.886 --> 17:06.824
but it fires like a rocket launcher.

17:14.722 --> 17:16.064
You okay?

17:16.210 --> 17:17.201
Yeah.

17:18.484 --> 17:20.694
That gun had a little
bit of a kick to it.

17:21.045 --> 17:22.656
Ah, but look at my gel block.

17:23.108 --> 17:25.440
Now, that is a good shot

17:25.662 --> 17:27.227
Not like it was on the run.

17:28.286 --> 17:30.485
Hey. I will make you a deal.

17:30.485 --> 17:32.703
You stay out of my office,
I'll stay out of yours.

17:34.553 --> 17:35.666
Okay.

17:36.756 --> 17:37.988
Hey. not at work.

17:39.246 --> 17:41.030
Aren't you done with your little experiment?

17:41.470 --> 17:42.715
You know what?

17:42.715 --> 17:46.170
Diminishing my work as a CSI
is not to get you any points with me.

17:46.855 --> 17:48.413
No, what will?

17:48.413 --> 17:49.307
Leaving.

17:49.307 --> 17:51.185
I have to run the numbers on the spearguns.

17:51.496 --> 17:52.789
Okay,

17:52.974 --> 17:54.729
I'm gone. / Good.

17:55.092 --> 17:56.023
Get out.

17:56.467 --> 17:57.569
Fine.

18:04.978 --> 18:08.972
The Spanish kept better records of the ships
that sank than of the ones that made it.

18:08.972 --> 18:10.713
Well, that makes sense.

18:10.969 --> 18:13.205
You lose a ship, you lose all that gold.

18:13.205 --> 18:15.828
I guess, you lose your gold,
you lose your empire. right?

18:15.828 --> 18:19.540
They had 46 tons of gold and silver...

18:20.195 --> 18:21.998
religious art, jewelry.

18:21.998 --> 18:24.314
Over $2 billion dollars.
How do you let that sink?

18:24.314 --> 18:25.601
They got greedy.

18:25.843 --> 18:27.481
Overloaded the ship,

18:27.920 --> 18:29.433
left too late in the season...

18:29.433 --> 18:31.274
Got caught in a hurricane.
They never had a chance.

18:52.209 --> 18:54.956
One hurricane buried it,
another one cleaned it off.

18:55.590 --> 18:57.651
That's a good thing that came out of Andrew.

18:58.009 --> 18:59.839
You think finding treasure's good thing?

18:59.839 --> 19:01.089
It's gold.

19:01.326 --> 19:03.848
It's a good thing. / I don't know.
Everything I've seen,

19:03.947 --> 19:05.610
treasure only brings troubles to people.

19:05.610 --> 19:07.487
Are you saying that because...

19:07.487 --> 19:09.860
you never found your little treasure?

19:12.935 --> 19:15.585
Look, man. you got anything
from the manifest match the void?

19:15.585 --> 19:17.668
I got three possibles.

19:20.444 --> 19:22.677
The incese tray's the right size.

19:22.677 --> 19:25.112
But it's silver. it would have eroded.

19:25.112 --> 19:28.928
Gold wouldn't have,
but the ingots didn't match up.

19:29.867 --> 19:32.633
I'll tell you one thing that
Coast guard guy was right.

19:32.633 --> 19:35.119
Judging from the disturbances down there,

19:35.119 --> 19:37.174
somebody made off with millions.

20:03.417 --> 20:05.314
Sorry, never met him.

20:05.314 --> 20:08.123
Paulie Jackson works for you for 5 years.

20:08.123 --> 20:09.456
and you never met him?

20:09.456 --> 20:11.317
Well, he, he never actually
worked for me.

20:11.317 --> 20:13.946
He worked for Marty Jones,
and I hired Marty.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.975
you've always been insulated.

20:16.310 --> 20:17.922
Potential lawsuits.

20:18.265 --> 20:20.076
Indie contracting is the way to go.

20:20.076 --> 20:21.443
It's sad, but, you know.

20:21.443 --> 20:22.714
way of the world.

20:22.714 --> 20:24.635
when was the last time
you talked to Marty?

20:26.021 --> 20:27.856
Captain Hook, huh?

20:28.108 --> 20:29.827
A couple of weeks ago, why?

20:30.795 --> 20:32.438
Can I get our guests anything?

20:37.812 --> 20:39.232
I don't think so.

20:39.626 --> 20:40.605
Thank you.

20:40.605 --> 20:41.673
Shame.

20:45.844 --> 20:47.368
Could I, uh,

20:47.762 --> 20:49.256
Could I use your restroom?

20:50.132 --> 20:51.734
Thank you. Be right back.

20:56.385 --> 20:57.604
So uh..

20:57.604 --> 20:58.940
Marty is the real, uh,

20:58.940 --> 21:00.898
treasure nut, you know.

21:07.399 --> 21:09.121
Something you need?

21:09.961 --> 21:11.286
Possibly.

21:11.430 --> 21:12.908
These are husband's?

21:14.993 --> 21:17.209
He likes to mount all his trophies.

21:18.802 --> 21:20.972
I bet that makes you feel special, huh?

21:22.602 --> 21:24.198
Oh, it does.

21:30.795 --> 21:33.300
Mr. Betancourt, do you own a speargun?

21:33.300 --> 21:34.690
I think, uh,

21:34.690 --> 21:36.466
I never use it, it's on my boat.

21:36.677 --> 21:38.173
Do you mind if I take a look?

21:39.518 --> 21:40.917
I'm starting to.

21:40.917 --> 21:43.576
Okay, I got an idea.
Why don't you lend us the speargun

21:43.576 --> 21:46.482
and I will ignore the endangered
fish in there.

21:46.990 --> 21:49.072
Report the fish. I'll pay the fine.

21:49.072 --> 21:50.987
This is crazy.
Why, why would I kill this guy?

21:50.987 --> 21:52.578
How about sunken treasure?

21:53.397 --> 21:55.027
Sunken treasure?

21:55.258 --> 21:57.634
My, my quadrant, that
are you kidding me?

21:58.845 --> 22:00.354
You seem surprised.

22:00.502 --> 22:01.437
Honey!

22:01.437 --> 22:04.425
- There's a delievery for you.
- Have them send it around back.

22:06.451 --> 22:09.867
Lieutenant, um, unless
you have a warrant.

22:10.072 --> 22:12.280
- It was really nice to meet you.
- Mr. Betancourt, You

22:12.280 --> 22:14.598
are about to make an enemy
you don't need.

22:14.598 --> 22:15.999
Trust me on that.

22:15.999 --> 22:17.296
Detective.

22:19.607 --> 22:22.895
Oh, hey, uh,
they find any treasure. it's, uh,

22:22.895 --> 22:24.258
mine.

22:24.800 --> 22:28.272
You notice? Both Marty and Betancourt
reacted the same way about treasure.

22:28.272 --> 22:30.259
Shocked it existed.

22:30.259 --> 22:33.743
Like gambling in Casablanca
one of them is lying.

22:33.743 --> 22:35.297
What's wrong?

22:35.297 --> 22:37.701
Look at this guy's tennis shoes.
they don't match his uniform.

22:37.701 --> 22:38.926
They're too clean.

22:38.926 --> 22:40.643
Mrs. Betancourt.
Where's the package?

22:40.643 --> 22:42.101
The delivery? the package?

22:42.101 --> 22:44.395
- Where's the package?
- Well, I.. I just gave it to..

22:45.325 --> 22:46.622
Bret!

22:55.890 --> 22:57.050
You okay?

22:57.300 --> 22:58.703
you okay?

22:59.703 --> 23:01.032
Stay here.

23:11.277 --> 23:12.786
A lot of bang for a letter bomb.

23:13.086 --> 23:14.140
Sheet explosive.

23:14.340 --> 23:16.557
Flexible, like a pad of paper.

23:19.285 --> 23:21.674
Betancourt probably thought
he was getting a contract.

23:21.674 --> 23:25.461
Yes, but not the kind he expecting.
As soon as he opened that package...

23:30.741 --> 23:34.074
If Marty did this, I'll find trace amounts
of uh, deep sea explosives.

23:34.074 --> 23:36.765
If it's not alive or nailed down
Speed, bag it.

23:36.765 --> 23:37.852
Alex.

23:37.852 --> 23:40.709
Bomb that size,
and all he lost was a hand.

23:40.709 --> 23:43.250
It's not from the shrapnel.
It's from the compression wave.

23:43.250 --> 23:46.032
Air moving at 900 feet per second.

23:46.032 --> 23:49.091
That kind of force would
macerate his internal organs.

23:49.091 --> 23:51.328
Turn his insides into jelly.

23:56.042 --> 23:58.253
but leaves the skins untouched.

23:58.465 --> 24:00.403
A million ways to die.

24:00.875 --> 24:02.479
So I heard you hurt yourself.

24:03.019 --> 24:04.377
No.

24:04.689 --> 24:06.454
Did detective Hagen tell you that?

24:06.675 --> 24:08.178
In passing.

24:09.321 --> 24:11.205
Are you okay? / All right.

24:11.205 --> 24:14.139
The examplar speargun did
give me a run for my money.

24:14.599 --> 24:15.707
can I see it?

24:17.632 --> 24:18.788
Ouch.

24:19.012 --> 24:21.609
- Well, our victim didn't have one of those.
- Well, then he didn't shoot the speargun.

24:21.609 --> 24:23.277
So he didn't kill Paul Jackson.

24:26.189 --> 24:27.258
Speed.

24:27.258 --> 24:28.654
Got an action switch.

24:28.654 --> 24:30.345
It's pretty sophisticated.

24:30.345 --> 24:32.189
It's more than that meathead
Marty could come up with.

24:32.189 --> 24:33.695
So we're dealing with a pro.

24:34.133 --> 24:35.500
Excuse me, ladies.

24:35.966 --> 24:37.275
Mrs. Betancourt.

24:37.275 --> 24:39.407
we'd like to find out
who killed your husband.

24:39.407 --> 24:41.879
A little while ago,
you were accusing him of murder.

24:41.879 --> 24:43.422
well, two things can be true at once.

24:43.422 --> 24:46.190
I would also like to take a look
on your yacht.

24:49.082 --> 24:51.020
You just saved my life.

24:51.329 --> 24:53.628
It's a little difficult for me to say no.

24:53.871 --> 24:55.178
I'll take that as yes.

24:56.434 --> 24:58.940
Well, it matches your
description of the murder weapon.

24:59.817 --> 25:01.119
Take a look at that.

25:02.537 --> 25:04.010
Smudgy prints.

25:04.281 --> 25:05.500
What do you think, Some kind of ink?

25:05.500 --> 25:08.157
It's from sulfides,
like from silver coins.

25:08.398 --> 25:10.957
Same as our victim, except Betancourt
doesn't bother to hide the gun.

25:10.957 --> 25:12.306
You think it's a plant?

25:12.551 --> 25:14.557
- I don't know.
- Is Betancourt a good guy?

25:14.786 --> 25:16.428
I wouldn't go that far.

25:17.935 --> 25:19.269
You smell that?

25:21.340 --> 25:23.117
That's diesel fuel. / Yeah.

25:23.505 --> 25:25.609
It's like it's seeping through the floor.

25:25.861 --> 25:28.858
Okay. Why would someone soak
a perfectly good yacht with diesel fuel?

25:28.858 --> 25:30.592
To fool the Coast guard.

25:30.656 --> 25:32.509
Drugs. / Yeah, cocaine.

25:32.509 --> 25:34.717
The diesel fuel throws off the detectors.

25:34.717 --> 25:36.755
Breaks down the molecular
Structure of the coke.

25:36.755 --> 25:37.963
No wonder she didn't want us on board.

25:37.963 --> 25:42.604
So if Betancourt's funding treasure
hunting to cover drug smuggling.

25:42.604 --> 25:44.509
he doesn't even know
they found gold.

25:44.702 --> 25:46.551
Do you think she'll talk to us? / Nope,

25:46.551 --> 25:49.899
Not on your life, but I know where we can
get some good information. Come on.

25:50.921 --> 25:53.975
Brought Coast guard's radar history of
this quadrant for the last three month.

25:53.975 --> 25:56.196
We ran the lat and long of our suspect.

25:56.196 --> 25:57.348
Betancourt.

25:58.021 --> 26:01.479
The fact that he had a private slip
made it real easy to ID his vessel.

26:01.673 --> 26:02.839
Like you thought,

26:02.839 --> 26:04.343
first Monday of every month,

26:04.343 --> 26:06.767
Betancourt would head out
to the same zone.

26:08.558 --> 26:10.182
Stay out there half (a day),

26:10.739 --> 26:12.503
head back, like clockwork / Okay,

26:12.503 --> 26:15.798
so what happened to Betancourt's
radar image while he was out there?

26:15.798 --> 26:17.851
Well, Radar works by line of sight.

26:17.851 --> 26:19.805
So if he's out of our line of sight...

26:20.411 --> 26:21.905
He's in a dead zone.

26:22.338 --> 26:23.959
Right there.

26:23.959 --> 26:26.925
He knew exaclty how to exploit
the government's weaknesses.

26:27.091 --> 26:29.701
Okay. We know what he did.
What did Marty do?

26:29.701 --> 26:31.295
Our Captain Hook.

26:32.402 --> 26:35.029
Followed same pattern
every day except one.

26:36.438 --> 26:38.044
The day before the murder.

26:38.044 --> 26:40.283
Then his boat disappeared off radar.

26:41.279 --> 26:43.135
When he should have been
looking for shipwrecks,

26:43.135 --> 26:45.746
Maybe he stumbled onto
Betancourt's coke.

26:55.850 --> 26:58.583
Then he reappears outside
of the dead zone.

26:58.745 --> 27:01.166
15 minutes later, he pulls a U-ey,

27:01.293 --> 27:04.821
and doesn't stay long enough
to dive, and not even to drop an anchor.

27:04.821 --> 27:07.990
Nobody goes that far out to sea
just to turn around, do they?

27:07.990 --> 27:09.348
Maybe he picked something up.

27:09.348 --> 27:10.534
Or maybe...

27:10.534 --> 27:12.510
he dropped something off.

27:39.618 --> 27:42.141
H, I got something.

27:43.377 --> 27:45.238
Send it up, Eric.

28:12.921 --> 28:14.447
White gold.

28:15.182 --> 28:17.498
It's not just any coke, either.
Look at the mark.

28:18.146 --> 28:19.347
"100F"

28:19.347 --> 28:22.817
Javier Cienfuegos.

28:22.817 --> 28:24.497
The finest in Columbia. So,

28:24.497 --> 28:26.264
I guess we know who
letter-bombed our guy.

28:26.264 --> 28:27.546
Now, where's the rest of it?

28:27.546 --> 28:29.350
We were down there three quarters
of an hour, H.

28:29.350 --> 28:30.459
There's nothing else down there.

28:30.459 --> 28:34.524
Nobody risks a plane and a pilot
for 50 keys. Let's find the rest of it.

28:35.251 --> 28:36.838
The question remains, Marty.

28:36.838 --> 28:39.832
Did you transfer the rest of cocaine
to your salvage boat, or not?

28:39.832 --> 28:41.158
What rest?

28:41.158 --> 28:43.843
I didn't take any cocaine
from any drop zone.

28:43.843 --> 28:45.255
No, you moved it.

28:45.255 --> 28:48.927
And you moved it to make it look like
Betancourt had skimmed from the Columbians.

28:48.927 --> 28:51.899
so you and Paul would get the treasure.

29:03.305 --> 29:05.920
Until, of course, you put
a spear into Paul, right?

29:05.920 --> 29:07.673
Look, man, I don't even own a speargun.

29:07.673 --> 29:09.195
No, you don't.
But Betancourt does.

29:09.195 --> 29:11.358
I didn't shoot Paulie.

29:11.358 --> 29:13.236
You're lying, Marty.

29:17.510 --> 29:18.896
Go ahead, check me.

29:18.896 --> 29:20.047
I bruise easy.

29:20.047 --> 29:21.511
Do you see a bruise there?

29:21.613 --> 29:22.967
NOpe.

29:23.552 --> 29:25.090
Lift up your shirt.

29:25.244 --> 29:27.194
What? / Lift up your shirt, Marty.

29:32.883 --> 29:34.731
- That's a bruise.
- Hey, hey, come on.

29:34.731 --> 29:36.659
I.. I don't even know how to use
a speargun. / No, you don't.

29:36.659 --> 29:37.940
You don't know how to use one.

29:37.940 --> 29:39.711
and that's why you held it like a pistol.

29:39.711 --> 29:41.295
you and your hook.

29:46.719 --> 29:49.244
And the you snuck back
onto Betancourt's boat,

29:49.244 --> 29:50.600
and replaced it.

29:54.648 --> 29:56.401
Says who?

29:59.906 --> 30:01.314
Says who.

30:01.314 --> 30:04.185
The miracle of science, Marty.
Take a look at that.

30:04.185 --> 30:07.484
Transer sulfides on the speargun.

30:18.054 --> 30:19.894
Hey, officer.

30:24.381 --> 30:26.032
So let me guess..

30:26.449 --> 30:29.490
the State's Attorney is
refusing to proscute, right?

30:29.490 --> 30:31.998
I made her case.
I told her everything.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.131
She told you...

30:33.131 --> 30:36.964
that we have no witnesses.
Smduges, no prints.

30:37.163 --> 30:39.200
and nothing to place
him on the crime scene.

30:39.200 --> 30:44.006
So Paul Jackson is dead. and
our friend Marty over there goes free.

30:44.460 --> 30:46.055
For now.

31:03.485 --> 31:04.512
Hey.

31:05.308 --> 31:06.728
Hi.

31:08.558 --> 31:11.260
Your message ran out
on my voice mail, but...

31:11.436 --> 31:12.616
I got the gist.

31:12.616 --> 31:15.846
I just can't believe you told Horatio
I was hurt by an experiment.

31:15.846 --> 31:20.120
Relax. / I happen to know that "relax"
is cop-speak for "shut up".

31:20.982 --> 31:22.366
Look. all I'm saying is..

31:22.366 --> 31:25.490
Please don't tell anybody I am anything
less than squared away on a case.

31:25.490 --> 31:26.600
All right?

31:26.600 --> 31:29.472
It was a nothing conversation
in the elevator, Calleigh... / John.

31:31.656 --> 31:33.070
Loud and clear.

31:33.070 --> 31:34.444
Thank you.

31:39.052 --> 31:40.472
Are you a religious man?

31:40.472 --> 31:42.110
After a fashion.

31:42.404 --> 31:45.200
I've been looking for
an object to fill our void.

31:45.547 --> 31:47.438
I got it.

31:48.211 --> 31:51.291
The Cross of Santiago
was at the murder scene.

31:52.789 --> 31:53.717
It's a beauty.

31:53.717 --> 31:57.504
Probably that one piece Marty held
out for his partner to chew on

31:57.504 --> 31:59.236
while he hid the rest of his stash.

31:59.236 --> 32:01.699
So Paulie is on his new boat.

32:01.699 --> 32:04.020
admiring his Cross...

32:06.230 --> 32:07.646
Bets..

32:07.646 --> 32:09.622
And then Captain Hook shows up.

32:24.806 --> 32:28.007
Marty probably stashed the Cross
with the rest of his loot, whatever that is.

32:28.007 --> 32:29.363
Or he sold it.

32:29.363 --> 32:31.631
This guy has to get out of
our jurisdiction, doesn't he?

32:31.631 --> 32:34.139
You don't think that would raise
a lot of flags in Miami fencing?

32:34.139 --> 32:35.472
It might for gold,

32:35.472 --> 32:38.942
but the Cross is a work of art.
He could sell it on the grey market.

32:39.961 --> 32:41.119
Yeah.

32:41.119 --> 32:42.343
That's the big skam.

32:42.343 --> 32:44.012
Art collectors.

32:44.012 --> 32:45.858
they never say items were stolen.

32:45.858 --> 32:47.724
they say they were found.

32:48.229 --> 32:51.215
I'll get into it.
I'll start looking for internet grey sites.

32:52.594 --> 32:53.804
Keep me posted.

33:09.177 --> 33:10.594
Mrs. Betancourt.

33:10.594 --> 33:12.196
I didn't know where else to go.

33:12.196 --> 33:13.827
My husband...

33:14.663 --> 33:17.135
I'm worried I could be in danger, too.

33:18.469 --> 33:23.540
Well, I think Cienfuegos has made his
point so for the time being you are safe

33:23.540 --> 33:26.366
unless there's something
you're not telling me.

33:27.679 --> 33:30.105
I always believed
that Bret was a salvager.

33:30.950 --> 33:32.448
Go on.

33:33.407 --> 33:35.005
Legally, he was...

33:35.005 --> 33:36.591
a salvager, Lieutenant.

33:36.591 --> 33:40.019
So let me get this straight.
You are here for the treasure.

33:40.019 --> 33:41.451
By rights, it is mine.

33:41.451 --> 33:42.965
as my husband's widow.

33:42.965 --> 33:45.243
Mrs. Betancourt,
if you go down this road,

33:45.243 --> 33:48.099
the DEA will label you an accomplice.

33:48.099 --> 33:51.289
seize your assets and throw you
in federal prison for the drug smuggling.

33:51.289 --> 33:54.760
- I never smuggled a thing.
- No, but you benefited from it.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.426
Well, it's not like I have savings.

33:57.426 --> 33:59.668
Bret handled all our money.

33:59.964 --> 34:01.119
My advice to you...

34:01.119 --> 34:04.092
is to put your house on the market,
move to Palm Springs,

34:04.092 --> 34:07.491
or Arizona or anywhere
where it is landlocked.

34:11.676 --> 34:13.398
You ever get out to Palm Springs,

34:13.398 --> 34:15.051
Lieutenant Caine?

34:18.021 --> 34:19.661
Only on business.

34:24.878 --> 34:27.038
Will there be anything else?

34:27.360 --> 34:29.098
Apparently not.

34:35.697 --> 34:37.647
Insistent lady..

34:37.907 --> 34:39.225
Lady?

34:41.013 --> 34:41.803
How we doing?

34:41.803 --> 34:44.525
I checked the storage unit
Marty rented at the pier

34:44.525 --> 34:45.664
Found coconuts...

34:45.664 --> 34:47.145
hundreds of them.

34:47.339 --> 34:48.201
No treasure.

34:48.201 --> 34:49.860
So he's playing with us.

34:51.242 --> 34:53.565
You okay? / I'm good.

34:53.981 --> 34:55.632
Yeah.

34:55.940 --> 34:57.709
Yellina.

35:02.588 --> 35:05.148
I'm not sleeping really
well since the bomb.

35:06.277 --> 35:07.932
Old memories.

35:14.226 --> 35:15.102
What?

35:15.102 --> 35:17.265
I'm just glad you're a bomb expert.

35:28.626 --> 35:31.277
I heard you're bidding
on the Cross of Santiago.

35:31.277 --> 35:33.567
I'm trying to.
I can't get into this art site.

35:33.567 --> 35:35.956
I got in on the old PDA.

35:36.291 --> 35:41.455
The Cross of Santiago could've been
ours yesterday for a mere $80,000.

35:41.838 --> 35:43.026
Somebody bought it?

35:43.026 --> 35:45.566
The Zaragosa was my last one.

35:45.566 --> 35:50.389
Now I have an artifact from every
Florida shipwreck of the 1960's.

35:50.389 --> 35:54.175
Congratulations. two men dead,
also you can have a matching set.

35:54.175 --> 35:57.279
It's their deaths that give
the art its value.

35:57.279 --> 36:01.575
Sailors carrying treasures
across oceans, through centuries.

36:01.575 --> 36:04.967
It's a sacred calling
to be an art collector.

36:05.136 --> 36:09.630
Ma'am, I'm afraid to tell you your Cross
of Santiago is now our evidence.

36:10.897 --> 36:12.865
Here it is. right over here.

36:13.989 --> 36:15.406
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

36:15.406 --> 36:18.090
- What is he doing?
- Oh, it's just a mild acid solution.

36:18.090 --> 36:20.230
That cross is part of
a murder investigation.

36:20.230 --> 36:21.769
and what he's doing is
tampering with evidence.

36:21.769 --> 36:24.887
So, that accounts for those little
smatterings of blood on the Cross.

36:24.887 --> 36:27.854
You just destroyed any fingerprints
the killer might have left.

36:27.854 --> 36:30.474
Well, I had no idea.
I'm terribly sorry.

36:30.474 --> 36:31.784
Yeah, sure you are.

36:31.784 --> 36:33.471
You know we're going to
need to take that from you, anyway.

36:33.471 --> 36:35.419
Oh, no, you don't.
This cross is mine.

36:35.419 --> 36:38.694
until you, youngsters bring me
a warrant from a sitting judge.

36:38.694 --> 36:41.820
Is that the sacred part you are
talking about there, Vivian?

36:41.956 --> 36:43.610
You must be an Yankee.

36:43.610 --> 36:45.042
Yeah, I'm from Jamaica, Queens.

36:45.042 --> 36:48.229
He's doing best to serve the great
state of Florida. Mrs. Kensington.

36:48.229 --> 36:50.233
He's a bit of rebel himself.

36:50.233 --> 36:52.234
So, if it wouldn't be too much trouble,

36:52.234 --> 36:55.679
would you mind if we got the name
who sold you the artifact?

36:55.679 --> 36:59.725
Well, I might just be able to find that
information for you somewhere.

36:59.725 --> 37:01.055
Thank you.

37:06.857 --> 37:08.570
Hey, I found out who sold the Cross.

37:08.570 --> 37:09.791
That's great.
What was the name?

37:09.791 --> 37:11.215
There wasn't a name.
It's a company.

37:11.215 --> 37:14.459
The check was made out
to Lost Penelope Salvage.

37:15.010 --> 37:16.324
Penelope?

37:16.324 --> 37:17.760
You recognize it?

37:19.645 --> 37:21.116
Yeah.

37:30.397 --> 37:31.961
Hey. Hi.

37:31.961 --> 37:33.247
Hi.

37:38.976 --> 37:40.700
Well...

37:41.079 --> 37:44.424
something tells me you didn't ask me
here to go diving, did you?

37:44.424 --> 37:46.596
No, I didn't.

37:48.281 --> 37:50.621
State was going to get its 80%.

37:50.621 --> 37:52.576
Just retroactively.

37:52.576 --> 37:55.888
- Everybody would do okay.
- Including you, right?

37:56.177 --> 37:58.014
I had the online auction account.

37:58.014 --> 37:59.768
My reputation.

37:59.768 --> 38:02.664
Marty was just going to give me
a kickback for selling the Cross.

38:02.664 --> 38:04.842
I hope the bonus is worth some jail time.

38:04.842 --> 38:07.706
Do you know how hard it is
to survive on a government paycheck?

38:07.706 --> 38:11.250
- Yes, I do.
- It was found money, Eric.

38:11.250 --> 38:14.220
Who gets hurt? / How about Paul
Jackson with a speargun in his chest?

38:14.220 --> 38:17.185
I had nothing to do with that.
That wasn't me, Nothing.

38:17.185 --> 38:19.203
By law you do, Christine.

38:19.203 --> 38:20.696
What?

38:22.790 --> 38:25.034
No. No.

38:25.490 --> 38:27.549
Oh, my god!

38:28.011 --> 38:29.730
Oh, my god.

38:32.512 --> 38:34.518
What can I do to fix this?

38:34.815 --> 38:36.361
I don't know.

38:36.361 --> 38:39.365
Maybe you can cut a deal for
yourself and shave off some time.

38:41.845 --> 38:43.196
Let's go.

38:45.319 --> 38:46.668
Hey, What can I say?

38:46.668 --> 38:48.118
Her word against mine.

38:48.118 --> 38:49.917
And she defrauded the state.

38:49.917 --> 38:51.795
What prosecutor going to go for that?

38:51.795 --> 38:53.370
You know, Marty?

38:54.161 --> 38:55.912
You're absolutely right.

38:57.521 --> 38:59.362
You know what I like about him?

38:59.663 --> 39:01.691
Grace in defeat.

39:01.691 --> 39:04.378
Yeah, try as we might,
can't all be winners.

39:04.378 --> 39:07.994
I hope you're not under the impression
that you've won something.

39:09.780 --> 39:11.824
Well, tell you what?

39:12.341 --> 39:14.404
I am walking out of here.

39:14.404 --> 39:17.512
Me and my hook are going down to claim
what you guys tried to steal from my quadrant.

39:17.512 --> 39:21.296
Flag on the play, Marty. We have
arrested the wreck of the Zaragosa.

39:21.296 --> 39:22.430
You can't.

39:22.430 --> 39:23.595
She is mine.

39:23.595 --> 39:24.860
As of an hour ago,

39:24.860 --> 39:28.131
she belongs to the State
University Marine center.

39:28.268 --> 39:30.828
You'll never see a penny. / Sorry,

39:30.828 --> 39:33.435
I'm the one who found her,
and I have a lease with the state.

39:33.435 --> 39:37.010
Which became null and void
the minute you sold the Cross.

39:41.249 --> 39:42.657
Okay, no big deal.

39:42.657 --> 39:44.207
No big deal.

39:44.409 --> 39:46.474
Why? Because you have your
stash on the side?

39:46.474 --> 39:49.609
Let's see how far you get with
that angry Columbian out there.

39:49.609 --> 39:52.562
You think he hasn't heard
you tampered with his cocaine.

39:53.240 --> 39:54.486
And if he hasn't,

39:54.486 --> 39:57.784
I'm sure Betancourt's widow
will let him know.

39:57.784 --> 40:00.139
Marty, don't accept any
registered mail.

40:00.139 --> 40:01.650
You're trying to scare me
so I'll give it up.

40:01.650 --> 40:03.902
I'm not. I'm trying to save your life.

40:05.904 --> 40:08.104
I like my odds out there.

40:08.104 --> 40:11.075
You're making a mistake, Marty.

40:13.467 --> 40:15.050
I've made them before.

40:19.044 --> 40:21.034
I hope it's not your last.

40:39.578 --> 40:41.469
Always standing guard.

40:41.728 --> 40:44.672
well, there's all kinds
of pirates out there.

40:44.975 --> 40:47.711
What would you do
if you found a treasure?

40:49.133 --> 40:51.597
What would you do? / Me?

40:51.897 --> 40:53.977
Wear better jewelry.

40:55.788 --> 40:58.729
I don't know.. travel...
See the world.

40:58.729 --> 41:01.107
Get Ray Jr. into private school.

41:02.729 --> 41:04.250
But you didn't answer my question.

41:05.092 --> 41:07.919
If you found a treasure,
what would you do?

41:12.697 --> 41:13.775
Hang on a second.

41:13.775 --> 41:14.846
Horatio.

41:15.570 --> 41:16.746
Where are you?

41:35.026 --> 41:36.223
When did they find it?

41:36.223 --> 41:37.479
An hour ago, sir.

41:37.813 --> 41:39.141
Throttle was wide open.

41:39.141 --> 41:40.436
Nobody's seen the owner.

41:40.436 --> 41:42.593
Looks like Marty was doing
a little celebrating.

41:51.081 --> 41:53.284
Well, I bet they didn't ask him nicely.

41:53.446 --> 41:54.551
who?

41:54.700 --> 41:55.876
The Columbians.

41:56.693 --> 42:00.038
Well, we've got a dying pirate either running
for his life or running for his treasure.

42:00.038 --> 42:01.856
Let's open this and figure it out.

42:06.297 --> 42:08.337
So, it was his treasure.

42:10.554 --> 42:12.427
How'd the Columbians miss that?

42:12.537 --> 42:13.881
They didn't.
They didn't know about it.

42:13.881 --> 42:16.930
They were too busy being focused
on him messing with theirs.

42:18.176 --> 42:19.312
Lieutenant.

42:19.493 --> 42:20.890
Should I call off my divers?

42:24.498 --> 42:25.944
Why don't you do that?

42:26.053 --> 42:27.784
Let's let tides find this one.
