11:43.877 --> 11:45.835
Okay.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.751
Drive. Drive.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.100
[tires squeal]

11:50.144 --> 11:52.494
[tires screeching]

11:59.240 --> 12:01.982
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you for saving me.

12:02.025 --> 12:03.331
You know, I was worried
you'd forgotten what

12:03.374 --> 12:05.028
"happy belated birthday"
was code for.

12:05.072 --> 12:07.596
I would never forget your
signal for extraction.

12:07.639 --> 12:10.120
What happened?You know, I should
have known that

12:10.164 --> 12:13.254
someone who insisted on
a get-to-know-you coffee first

12:13.297 --> 12:15.952
wasn't interested in
a bit of uncomplicated fun.

12:15.996 --> 12:18.868
I guess I was just
hoping that "coffee"

12:18.912 --> 12:21.305
was code for "afternoon tryst."

12:27.355 --> 12:29.966
Some people like
to ease into things

12:30.010 --> 12:31.054
before they get more serious.

12:31.098 --> 12:32.316
Oh. [chuckles] Yeah.

12:32.360 --> 12:33.796
Serious is
what I'm trying to avoid.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.885
Look where serious
has gotten me.

12:35.929 --> 12:38.583
Heartbroken,
soul mate gone,

12:38.627 --> 12:42.065
and a huge void in my life
where Odette used to be.

12:42.109 --> 12:44.154
Oh, now I'm sad.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.330
Is there anything
in this car that I can eat?

12:47.462 --> 12:49.507
Oh...

12:49.551 --> 12:51.031
Terry? Who's Terry?

12:51.074 --> 12:52.772
Not those, actually.

12:52.815 --> 12:57.080
[gasps] Oh, my God, are you
cheating on Amanda?
No.

12:57.124 --> 12:58.647
No, we're fine.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.214
Never better, in fact.

13:00.257 --> 13:02.651
This is just an errand
I agreed to run.

13:02.694 --> 13:05.393
That's an odd sort of errand.

13:05.436 --> 13:06.873
Tell me more.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.440
[phones chime]

13:11.573 --> 13:13.575
Nick figured out where our
murder victim was staying.

13:13.618 --> 13:14.837
Let's go.
[chuckles]

13:14.881 --> 13:17.840
Look who's saved by
the extraction text now.

13:17.884 --> 13:20.103
[birds calling]

13:25.892 --> 13:27.197
RYAN: We need
to call the cops.

13:27.241 --> 13:30.157
Yeah, we will.
After we take a peek.

13:39.644 --> 13:41.255
Okay...

13:48.262 --> 13:49.829
That dead guy
from the corn maze,

13:49.872 --> 13:51.874
his name is Matthew Burke.

13:51.918 --> 13:56.748
"I am alive forevermore and have
the keys of hell and death."

13:56.792 --> 13:59.229
That's a Bible verse.
From the Book of Revelation.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.492
"The Great Darkness
will soon be restored.

14:01.536 --> 14:04.365
A crown beset
by the mark of four."

14:04.408 --> 14:06.889
This guy was
a wannabe prophet.

14:06.933 --> 14:09.022
Okay, and he also had
this reoccurring nightmare.

14:09.065 --> 14:13.330
"I see the hilltop flooded with
blood and the claps of thunder."

14:14.984 --> 14:16.899
Looks like he was
writing everything down

14:16.943 --> 14:18.248
to try and make sense
of it all.

14:18.292 --> 14:19.554
Hey, gas station receipts.

14:19.597 --> 14:22.078
He drove from
Pennsylvania in one day.

14:22.122 --> 14:23.732
Wonder what the rush was.

14:23.775 --> 14:25.952
My watch.

14:25.995 --> 14:28.476
The one that I lost
at the grocery store.

14:31.174 --> 14:33.394
He's got articles of me,
Everett.

14:33.437 --> 14:36.440
He picked up my watch.
He-he was following me.

14:36.484 --> 14:39.008
He was keeping track
of every living Hudson.

14:40.618 --> 14:41.793
Including me.

14:41.837 --> 14:44.231
Okay, but...

14:44.274 --> 14:46.624
besides my watch,
what did he want from us?

14:55.329 --> 14:57.548
[indistinct radio transmission]

14:58.723 --> 14:59.942
Hi there, Nancy.Hey.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.726
We got your message
on the tip line,

15:01.770 --> 15:02.945
about the campsite you found.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.947
A couple unis
are checking it out.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.427
You need anything else?

15:06.470 --> 15:11.736
I just came in to find out
the status of my application

15:11.780 --> 15:12.999
for Community Police Liaison.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.261
Election's not until next week.

15:14.304 --> 15:16.176
Although the position is mostly

15:16.219 --> 15:17.177
relaying town council minutes

15:17.220 --> 15:18.874
via email newsletter.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.049
Why would you want to do that?

15:20.093 --> 15:21.659
Yeah, I just figured I would

15:21.703 --> 15:22.965
apply to as many last-minute

15:23.009 --> 15:24.619
volunteer opportunities
as possible.

15:24.662 --> 15:26.055
Pad my resume in case

15:26.099 --> 15:28.362
I get wait-listed at Columbia.

15:30.190 --> 15:31.452
Who's the suit?

15:34.455 --> 15:37.284
FBI profiler, from
the field office in Boston.

15:37.327 --> 15:39.851
Oh. The specialist.

15:39.895 --> 15:42.332
Does he have a theory?

15:42.376 --> 15:43.725
That's what the briefing's for.

15:43.768 --> 15:45.335
Can I listen in?

15:45.379 --> 15:48.295
Very funny.
Tell your father I said hello.

15:48.338 --> 15:50.514
Will do.

15:52.734 --> 15:55.563
Oh, sorry.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.131
Sorry about that.

16:02.874 --> 16:05.051
[line ringing]

16:05.094 --> 16:06.269
Hey.

16:06.313 --> 16:08.054
How'd it go
at the gas station

16:08.097 --> 16:09.403
from Matthew's receipts?

16:09.446 --> 16:11.709
Well, the attendant
remembered Matthew because

16:11.753 --> 16:13.146
he had a Southern accent.

16:13.189 --> 16:15.931
Said he seemed really tired,
but that was all.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.106
How'd it go at the station?

16:17.150 --> 16:19.282
[exhales]
The FBI profiler is here.

16:19.326 --> 16:21.981
He's behind closed doors,
but I managed to get

16:22.024 --> 16:23.721
a look at the autopsy photo.

16:23.765 --> 16:26.681
There was a moth wing
on Matthew's clothes.

16:28.639 --> 16:31.294
You know what?
I recognized it, actually.

16:31.338 --> 16:33.601
It's a... it's a rare species

16:33.644 --> 16:35.472
that's found outside of
Icarus Hall in the woods.

16:35.516 --> 16:37.257
I'm gonna head there now.Okay, great.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.215
Well, we're gonna take
care of everything else

16:39.259 --> 16:42.566
on our to-do list before
people close up early

16:42.610 --> 16:45.265
because there's a killer
on the loose. Bye.

16:47.745 --> 16:49.356
Okay.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.752
So how are you and Amanda?

16:54.796 --> 16:59.279
Is her epic hike along
the Camino de Santiago

16:59.322 --> 17:01.977
causing problems
de larga distancia?

17:02.021 --> 17:04.675
No?
No, we are great.

17:04.719 --> 17:08.853
But this week, her dad
got an early release,

17:08.897 --> 17:12.422
um, because he helped with
Everett Hudson's arrest.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.946
So, I didn't want
Amanda to worry.

17:15.991 --> 17:20.082
I gave her dad a ride to
his crash pad in Lewiston.

17:20.126 --> 17:24.347
Okay, well, couldn't the other
Bobbsey twin just do that?
No.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.175
Gil is on a pilgrimage
to New Mexico

17:26.219 --> 17:27.524
to find their
long-lost mother.

17:27.568 --> 17:29.700
And what about
the box of chocolates?

17:29.744 --> 17:32.094
Mr. Bobbsey asked me

17:32.138 --> 17:33.748
for some help
with deliveries.

17:33.791 --> 17:36.446
They're, like,
amends gifts chocolate

17:36.490 --> 17:38.709
for people like Terry.

17:38.753 --> 17:42.539
Ace, this is how
you reel in a mark. Okay?

17:42.583 --> 17:46.891
Y-You start with small favors,
and then you go to bigger ones.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.371
Uh, what has Amanda said?

17:48.415 --> 17:51.505
I texted her.
She hasn't responded yet.

17:51.548 --> 17:53.811
She's summiting something.

17:55.596 --> 17:59.121
I will stay on my guard
with Mr. Bobbsey, I promise.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.084
[sighs]

18:06.781 --> 18:08.261
NANCY:
George hasn't been able
to make any sense

18:08.304 --> 18:09.653
of Matthew's writings.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.220
Did you find anything out
at the grocery store?

18:11.264 --> 18:12.743
Ah, not much.

18:12.787 --> 18:14.441
The parking lot didn't have
surveillance cameras,

18:14.484 --> 18:15.529
and that's the only time
that Matthew

18:15.572 --> 18:16.921
could have taken my watch.

18:16.965 --> 18:19.794
[loud clatter]Uh...

18:21.012 --> 18:22.449
[exhales sharply]

18:22.492 --> 18:24.973
Don't worry.
It only looks haunted.

18:25.016 --> 18:27.193
Last time we were here,

18:27.236 --> 18:29.717
I-I rid the place
of a host of phantoms.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.807
Oh, cool. Cool.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.027
The only thing
I accomplished

18:36.071 --> 18:38.247
before I went
to college was

18:38.291 --> 18:40.162
wrecking my dad's Bugatti

18:40.206 --> 18:42.469
and getting a C-minus
in Physics.

18:45.036 --> 18:46.821
I'm proud of you.

18:48.953 --> 18:50.825
What?

18:52.609 --> 18:54.959
Would you still be proud
of me if I was writing

18:55.003 --> 18:58.833
investigative articles for
the college newspaper, or...

18:58.876 --> 19:01.270
learning how to
navigate the subway?

19:01.314 --> 19:03.838
You know, normal stuff?

19:04.665 --> 19:07.450
So that's why
you want to go to Columbia.

19:07.494 --> 19:09.191
You want to live
somewhere normal

19:09.235 --> 19:10.845
and take the subway
to get there.

19:10.888 --> 19:14.501
I just want to be
somewhere where

19:14.544 --> 19:17.417
I've got space to grow up.

19:17.460 --> 19:21.247
Not be boxed in
as billionaire waitress.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.292
Girl detective.

19:23.336 --> 19:25.599
Pretty much.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.037
Who's there?

19:29.080 --> 19:30.821
[low growling]

19:36.479 --> 19:38.873
[glass shattering]

19:46.054 --> 19:49.275
Next time you decide
to drop in, call ahead.

19:49.927 --> 19:52.408
No, this can't be possible.

19:53.540 --> 19:54.976
Have you two met?

19:55.019 --> 19:56.325
We actually have.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.327
Right before
I acquired her blood,

19:58.371 --> 19:59.894
bathed in it
to restore my youth,

19:59.937 --> 20:01.939
then used what was
left of it to bring down

20:01.983 --> 20:03.202
an invisible barrier

20:03.245 --> 20:04.768
that had kept me out
of Horseshoe Bay

20:04.812 --> 20:08.207
for 172 years.

20:08.250 --> 20:11.384
I'm Temperance Hudson.
Tea?

20:22.482 --> 20:24.310
NANCY:
How are you alive?

20:24.353 --> 20:26.355
The Women In White
killed you in 1847.

20:26.399 --> 20:27.704
BESS:
Yeah, we saw it with
our own eyes.

20:27.748 --> 20:30.490
They buried you
in the Hudson mausoleum.

20:33.319 --> 20:35.582
But was I really dead?

20:35.625 --> 20:38.715
What if I knew what was
coming that night in the woods?

20:38.759 --> 20:43.242
What if I dosed myself ahead
of time with a revival hex?

20:43.285 --> 20:45.287
Did that revival hex
also put you

20:45.331 --> 20:47.202
in an old lady
suit, Myrtle?

20:47.246 --> 20:49.944
It aged me prematurely.

20:49.987 --> 20:53.556
A small price to pay
to cheat death.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.297
Did any of
your records ever mention

20:55.341 --> 20:57.473
how much I love
playing games with death?

20:57.517 --> 20:59.301
Okay, nobody
drink the tea.

20:59.345 --> 21:02.435
What do you want, Temperance?
Why are you here?

21:02.478 --> 21:04.045
GEOREG: According to the Women
In White, she tried to summon

21:04.088 --> 21:05.916
a dark power that lay
beneath the town.

21:05.960 --> 21:10.312
Those snowflakes were
so dramatic.

21:10.356 --> 21:11.705
They kicked me out
for dabbling

21:11.748 --> 21:15.274
in ambitious new techniques,
nothing more.

21:15.317 --> 21:18.320
I'm here because
this is my home.

21:18.364 --> 21:21.715
This hall stands on land
that I once owned.

21:21.758 --> 21:24.979
I have a right to return
after seven generations.

21:25.022 --> 21:26.807
Is that the same right
that you exercised

21:26.850 --> 21:29.679
when you stole my daughter's
blood to restore you youth?

21:29.723 --> 21:31.115
To be fair,
she was done with it.

21:31.159 --> 21:33.857
Can-can we just refocus
on the fact

21:33.901 --> 21:37.208
that a week after Temperance
breaks a barrier,

21:37.252 --> 21:38.471
moves back to town,

21:38.514 --> 21:41.038
and settles in at Icarus Hall,

21:41.082 --> 21:42.388
there is a murder?

21:42.431 --> 21:44.477
A dead man who was obsessed
with quotes

21:44.520 --> 21:45.608
from the Book of Revelation.

21:45.652 --> 21:47.480
He was? Which ones?

21:47.523 --> 21:48.872
Oh, don't play dumb.

21:52.136 --> 21:53.529
We could work together

21:53.573 --> 21:56.793
to figure out who
the murderer is.

21:56.837 --> 21:58.795
I'm just as invested
as you are.

21:58.839 --> 22:01.189
After all, you saw
the man stalking my home.

22:01.232 --> 22:03.931
You're welcome for
saving your lives, by the way.

22:03.974 --> 22:06.499
How do we know that this man
wasn't just a trick of yours?

22:06.542 --> 22:09.458
I mean, you create entities.
You-you made the Wraith.

22:09.502 --> 22:13.506
The Wraith was
an ill-conceived mistake.

22:13.549 --> 22:16.160
I don't know who
the man in the hat is.

22:16.204 --> 22:17.423
Okay, call the cops
and tell 'em

22:17.466 --> 22:18.685
you have a suspect right here.

22:18.728 --> 22:21.427
And when they ask
what evidence I have,

22:21.470 --> 22:24.952
I tell them that she's
my 200-year-old great-aunt

22:24.995 --> 22:26.780
who's also an occultist
who tried to summon

22:26.823 --> 22:28.651
a dark power from
underneath the town

22:28.695 --> 22:30.392
and is possibly here
to finish the work she started

22:30.436 --> 22:32.133
seven generations ago?

22:32.176 --> 22:34.831
Weirder things have happened.

22:34.875 --> 22:37.443
Can't think of any right now.

22:37.486 --> 22:40.794
If you enjoy being wrong,
go right ahead.

22:40.837 --> 22:42.448
But if you're interested
in the truth,

22:42.491 --> 22:44.450
how about a game?

22:46.669 --> 22:48.628
No, I think we're good.

22:48.671 --> 22:51.413
TEMPERANCE: One of you
will be the other's demise.

I don't know, the only
evidence linking her

23:50.646 --> 23:52.039
to the crime are
moths from Icarus Hall.

with lotus flowers.

Anyway, Temperance
had no motive

24:13.277 --> 24:14.801

24:14.844 --> 24:17.456
Listen, Matthew was obsessed
with all the living Hudsons.

24:29.337 --> 24:30.860

25:07.462 --> 25:08.463
Hmm.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.596
Hi.
Hey.

25:10.639 --> 25:13.294
I brought you a gift.

25:13.337 --> 25:15.644
Oh, um, Jean,

25:15.688 --> 25:17.341
before you say anything else,

25:17.385 --> 25:21.476

25:22.521 --> 25:24.566
Oh.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.525
Did I miss the part
where I asked you out?

25:28.352 --> 25:30.877
Oh. Ye-- You weren't...

25:30.920 --> 25:35.708
So these chocolates are
sold in grocery stores.

25:35.751 --> 25:37.492
Anyone can buy them.

25:37.536 --> 25:41.365
But these boxes...

25:41.409 --> 25:44.064
were recently seized

25:44.107 --> 25:45.979
at a stop and search
of some persons of interest.

25:46.022 --> 25:48.198
So we think that there's
a group of local criminals

25:48.242 --> 25:51.593
that have devised a way
to communicate undetected

25:51.637 --> 25:54.988
by hiding messages
via analog courier.

25:55.031 --> 25:58.165
So if you see the-the gift
tags on the confiscated box

25:58.208 --> 25:59.819
are slightly altered.

25:59.862 --> 26:01.516
So I'm trying to figure out
if that's how they've been

26:01.560 --> 26:02.822
encoding their messages.

26:02.865 --> 26:04.606
Old-school communication.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.739
Makes surveillance impossible.

26:06.782 --> 26:10.351
Yes. I'm hoping to question
one of your clients,

26:10.394 --> 26:11.744
Asher Davies.

26:11.787 --> 26:14.268
He's a former associate
of a suspect on my list.

26:14.311 --> 26:17.706
If Davies can offer me
some helpful information,

26:17.750 --> 26:20.317
I'll cut him a deal on
his petty larceny charge.

26:20.361 --> 26:21.492
No jail time.

26:21.536 --> 26:24.365
I will recommend
that he cooperates.

26:24.408 --> 26:26.280
Mm. Perfect.

the old-timey cookbook?

26:39.641 --> 26:43.384
This's a grimoire of rituals,
Written by Temperance Hudson.

26:43.427 --> 26:46.039
As in handwritten.

26:46.082 --> 26:50.609
So we can compare the
handwriting with the killer's,

26:50.652 --> 26:52.567
starting with
the capital letters.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.701
G, A, C, I...

26:55.744 --> 26:58.051
Yeah, none of those
match her writing.

26:58.094 --> 27:01.707
I mean, Temperance
had lovely penmanship.

27:01.750 --> 27:04.100
Our guy writes
like Charles Manson.

27:04.144 --> 27:06.929
He's got this
real distinct "K."

27:08.322 --> 27:10.629
Let me see that.

27:12.065 --> 27:16.112
Yeah, Temperance's Ks are
all Gothic and spooky.

27:16.156 --> 27:18.985
The killer's had
a tick-mark at the beginning,

27:19.028 --> 27:21.857
and a closed loop
that doesn't reach the stem.

27:24.381 --> 27:26.732
I've seen this "K" before.

27:31.084 --> 27:34.653
I have to call the police.
I know who the killer is.

27:41.747 --> 27:44.271
Hi. Did they arrest
the college kids I called about?

27:44.314 --> 27:47.927
You're the local who keeps
phoning in with tips.

27:47.970 --> 27:50.059
I called exactly twice

27:50.103 --> 27:51.974
because I want
to keep my town safe.

27:52.018 --> 27:54.281
Well, I appreciate your level of
civic engagement...

27:54.324 --> 27:58.198
Before you dismiss me as
a civilian or an amateur,

27:58.241 --> 27:59.678
you should know that
I've been solving crimes

27:59.721 --> 28:01.114
since I was in
the seventh grade.

28:01.157 --> 28:03.943
I've rescued kidnapping victims,
prevented murders,

28:03.986 --> 28:06.119
recovered stolen treasures

28:06.162 --> 28:08.121
and reunited long-lost
family members.

28:08.164 --> 28:10.514
I've exposed corruption
in law enforcement

28:10.558 --> 28:12.473
and figured out
a lot of mysteries

28:12.516 --> 28:13.866
that other people
couldn't crack.

28:13.909 --> 28:17.130
So... Some days I even
bring killers to justice,

28:17.173 --> 28:18.740
like today.

28:18.784 --> 28:21.700
Meaning the teenagers
you accused?

28:26.139 --> 28:27.749
Did they confess?

28:27.793 --> 28:29.316
They are refusing
to be held accountable.

28:29.359 --> 28:31.797
They say their friend
Dustin was behind the prank.

28:33.407 --> 28:34.930
Sorry, did you say prank?

28:34.974 --> 28:36.715
Unis are on their way to pick up
Dustin from campus now,

28:36.758 --> 28:38.586
but all three were at their dorm

28:38.629 --> 28:40.675
when Matthew Burke
was murdered.

28:41.894 --> 28:43.809
They have been
alibied by classmates.

28:43.852 --> 28:45.375
So they're just vandals?

28:45.419 --> 28:48.770
Bright side: the walls
of your town are safe again.

28:48.814 --> 28:51.773
Then why does that one
look so upset?

28:52.905 --> 28:54.863
He says Dustin lost their cat,

28:54.907 --> 28:56.778
if you're looking for
something else to investigate.

28:56.822 --> 28:59.912
Mm. I do not do missing pets.

28:59.955 --> 29:03.567
But you do investigate clues

29:03.611 --> 29:05.918
that other people
have overlooked.

29:05.961 --> 29:07.963
And that has
yielded answers in the past.

29:08.007 --> 29:09.791
According to
the public record,

29:09.835 --> 29:11.445
and as seen in
the many arrest reports

29:11.488 --> 29:13.926

in various capacities.

29:13.969 --> 29:15.231
Have you read up on me?

29:15.275 --> 29:16.972
Well, the way
you announced yourself

29:17.016 --> 29:18.582

indicated that

29:18.626 --> 29:20.497
you thought
the name "Nancy Drew"

29:20.541 --> 29:21.890
would carry weight
with the police,

29:21.934 --> 29:24.153
and I was curious
to find out why.

29:24.197 --> 29:26.199
So then you know
that I could help you.

29:27.940 --> 29:30.246
I may have been solving crimes
for fewer years than you,

29:30.290 --> 29:32.292
and my estimate is based off
your apparent age,

29:32.335 --> 29:34.468
minus the average
age of a seventh-grader,

29:34.511 --> 29:35.730
but I did train at Quantico

29:35.774 --> 29:37.384
after completing
my psychology residency.

29:37.427 --> 29:40.517
It's where I learned that
the most valuable tool we have

29:40.561 --> 29:42.171
is our objectivity.

29:42.215 --> 29:44.043
Given your history
with the town and the fact

29:44.086 --> 29:45.958
that the body of the victim
was found on property

29:46.001 --> 29:49.788
held in your name, your
objectivity will be compromised.

29:49.831 --> 29:53.879
So I am going to decline
your offer of help.

29:53.922 --> 29:56.925

your level of civic engagement,

that I respect.
