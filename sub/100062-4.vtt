WEBVTT

00:03.737 --> 00:05.639
Y'know, because we've been
together for 3 months.

00:05.673 --> 00:06.474
It's been 6.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.142
But I'm glad we feel
the same way

00:08.176 --> 00:09.643
about anniversaries.

00:09.677 --> 00:10.644
Lame.Lame.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.946
So can I get that Ho-Ho back
or...?

00:15.949 --> 00:17.551
6 months of dating.

00:17.585 --> 00:18.819
That beats my record by...

00:18.852 --> 00:20.221
6 months.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.490
Your dad won't stop raving
about Tina at the restaurant.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.925
I try to not let it affect
my performance at work,

00:24.958 --> 00:26.560
but it does.

00:26.594 --> 00:27.695
What does your mom
think of Tina?

00:27.728 --> 00:28.996
Thankfully,
they haven't met yet.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.431
There's no way
they'd ever get along.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.166
They both have
strong personalities.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.767
I prefer a strong woman.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.236
Physically I mean.

00:35.269 --> 00:38.038
Like she could lift a car off me
after a real bad accident.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.773
The only strong woman
my mom likes

00:39.807 --> 00:41.008
is the singer Amy Grant.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.377
And only because she can
silence her on command.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.778
So what happens
when they do meet?

00:44.812 --> 00:45.679
They won't.

00:45.713 --> 00:46.747
I can't take the chance

00:46.780 --> 00:48.349
my mom will ruin
my relationship.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.783
She ruins
everything I like...

00:49.817 --> 00:51.519
Well, I'm off
to see "Fight Club."

00:51.552 --> 00:52.886
No R-rated movies.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.956
Besides I heard Brad Pitt's
character is imaginary.

00:55.989 --> 00:57.725
That's just lazy writing.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.862
Hey,
where's the creamy filling?

01:01.895 --> 01:03.397
Oh, I took it.
You don't need it.

01:04.332 --> 01:06.667
Ma, what the hell did you do
to my N.W.A. shirt?

01:10.771 --> 01:13.274
Yeah, my mom and Tina
can never meet.

01:13.307 --> 01:15.709

01:15.743 --> 01:16.877
* Fresh off the boat

01:16.910 --> 01:18.579
* I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go *

01:18.612 --> 01:20.881
* If you don't know, homey,
now you know *

01:20.914 --> 01:22.116
* Fresh off the boat

01:22.150 --> 01:24.452
* Homey, you don't know
where I come from *

01:24.485 --> 01:25.953
* But I know where I'm goin'

01:25.986 --> 01:28.689
* I'm fresh off the boat

01:32.860 --> 01:34.262
Working out some stress,
Mommy?

01:34.295 --> 01:37.431
I'm warming up for my new
school administration class.

01:37.465 --> 01:38.966
Discipline.

01:38.999 --> 01:41.302
Writing I'm a rightie,
slapping I'm a leftie.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.504
I hope it's as rewarding
as my new Drama class.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.972
We're exploring
our emotions.

01:45.005 --> 01:46.006
I can cry on command.

01:46.039 --> 01:47.741
I think about tulips
wilting!

01:47.775 --> 01:48.842
Speaking of emotions,

01:48.876 --> 01:51.145
Trent tells me
you and Tina are going strong.

01:51.179 --> 01:52.846
Young love makes my heart
skip a beat.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.616
I hope
that's what it is.

01:55.649 --> 01:56.584
Love?

01:56.617 --> 01:57.818
Please.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.453
Me and Tina just bump into
each other sometimes.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.589
But, you know,
I bump into a lot of people.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.692
Long limbs, narrow hallways,
you do the math.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.660
So, Evan,
anything new with you?

02:06.694 --> 02:08.162
Anybody?

02:08.196 --> 02:09.297
Big G?

02:09.330 --> 02:11.265
Thank you for your interest,
Edwyn.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.133
Grandma and I
are going to explore

02:13.167 --> 02:14.802
the ancient art
of meditation.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.970
Ugh. Meditation is just
an expensive way

02:17.004 --> 02:18.038
to cross your legs.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.640
I've reached
a point in my life

02:19.673 --> 02:21.209
where I would
like to de-stress

02:21.242 --> 02:23.177
and enhance
my self-awareness.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.515
Fascinating.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.517
So we should continue
talking about other people.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.118
Dad,
you're a happening guy.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.220
What's new with you?

02:32.253 --> 02:34.054
Well, let's see...

02:34.087 --> 02:37.225
Ooh, at the restaurant,
we're introducing...

02:38.091 --> 02:40.894
...new napkins.

02:43.697 --> 02:44.832
Time to go.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.336
See ya, Dad.
Enjoy those napkins.

02:48.369 --> 02:51.171
I will!
Because that's my thing.

02:52.873 --> 02:55.008
Napkins.

02:56.244 --> 02:57.745
Hey, how about

02:57.778 --> 02:59.179
instead of studying
the French Revolution

02:59.213 --> 03:00.248
at your house,

03:00.281 --> 03:01.549
we can go to the mall

03:01.582 --> 03:03.484
and experience French culture
at Au Bon Pain?

03:03.517 --> 03:05.486
You're trying to get out
of studying.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.654
Je guilty.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.656
Tell you what.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.723
To mix it up,

03:09.757 --> 03:11.559
how about we study
at your place this time?

03:11.592 --> 03:13.694
Uh -- uh,
I wish we could,

03:13.727 --> 03:15.729
but...my house
is being fumigated.

03:15.763 --> 03:16.497
Again?

03:16.530 --> 03:18.432
You said that last week.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.768
I was looking forward
to finally meeting your mom.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.035
Well, you've met my dad,

03:22.069 --> 03:24.772
and he's basically just my mom
with shorter hair so...

03:24.805 --> 03:26.740
You don't want me to meet
your mother, do you?

03:26.774 --> 03:28.075
I'd love nothing more!

03:28.108 --> 03:30.911
Alas,
she's...out of town.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.280
Indefinitely.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.814
Jessica: Eddie!

03:35.483 --> 03:36.917
Isn't that your mom
over there?

03:36.950 --> 03:37.951
Eddie!
Calling your name.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.287
A lot of ladies
call my name.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.788
You'll have
to get used to that.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.290
Eddie, hurry up!

03:42.323 --> 03:44.091
You've got to get home
and clean your room.

03:44.124 --> 03:46.560
It smells like
gym socks and ham!

03:46.594 --> 03:47.728
You know what?

03:47.761 --> 03:49.530
I forgot I'm supposed
to let the fumigator in.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.964
He takes it personally
if I'm late.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.766
Dude's sensitive.
Like a lot of fumigators are.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.234
I'll call you later!

03:57.471 --> 04:00.140
Each napkin has a different
Orlando landmark.

04:00.173 --> 04:03.277
Look, it's Lake Apopka.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.212
At one time,
Florida's most polluted lake.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.547
Every napkin has a story.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.482
Just like the spills
they clean up.

04:08.516 --> 04:09.550
Beautiful.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.519
Hmm.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.292
I hope you're not a spy
for the health department.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.128
Seriously,
Evan got grounded for that.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.130
We're learning about
the hero's journey
for Drama class.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.632
I'm shadowing you
for a character study.

04:24.665 --> 04:25.499
Oh, good choice!

04:25.533 --> 04:27.335
I'm always journeying
like a hero.

04:27.368 --> 04:28.902
Did I mention the new napkins?

04:28.936 --> 04:29.970
Heck yeah you did!

04:30.003 --> 04:31.305
I've been thinking about them
all day!

04:31.339 --> 04:32.540
I love napkins!

04:33.607 --> 04:35.175
I'm sorry, Dad.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.277
We haven't had the class
on fake enthusiasm yet.

04:37.311 --> 04:38.579
Oh. That's alright.

04:38.612 --> 04:39.747
Who am I kidding?

04:39.780 --> 04:41.449
Nobody cares about napkins.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.451
I'm gonna collect
the whole set!

04:43.484 --> 04:46.086
I mean,
I love this place,

04:46.119 --> 04:47.455
but I'm feeling
kind of restless.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.689
I just turned 40,

04:48.722 --> 04:51.291
Cattleman's
practically runs itself.

04:51.325 --> 04:52.460
This may be my last chance

04:52.493 --> 04:54.127
to roll the dice
on something new.

04:54.161 --> 04:55.329
I get it.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.697
You're looking for
your "call to adventure."

04:56.730 --> 04:58.699
Last time I answered
a call to adventure,

04:58.732 --> 04:59.800
my identity got stolen.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.335
Never give anyone
your social.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.804
I want to find
my next big thing,

05:03.837 --> 05:05.339
but I just don't know
where to start.

05:05.373 --> 05:06.874
What if you took
an aptitude test?

05:06.907 --> 05:08.976
We took one for school,
and guess what they said

05:09.009 --> 05:10.578
my personality
was best suited for?

05:11.412 --> 05:12.446
Acting!

05:12.480 --> 05:13.647
Really?
Yes!

05:13.681 --> 05:15.015
And it only takes
20 minutes.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.149
45 if you're Eddie.

05:16.183 --> 05:17.385
Let's do it!

05:19.086 --> 05:20.454
Sorry,
just looking for...

05:20.488 --> 05:21.689
Found her!

05:21.722 --> 05:22.990
Orange County
Convention Center!

05:23.023 --> 05:25.459
Yes! I got all
the convention centers!

05:26.527 --> 05:28.629
* Stop for a minute *

05:28.662 --> 05:30.564
* Baby, I'm so glad
you're mine *

05:30.598 --> 05:32.132
Oh, Amy Grant.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.734
* Yeah *
I think it, and you sing it.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.904
I'll be in Grandma's room
practicing mindfulness.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.205
If you need me,

05:38.238 --> 05:40.307
maybe stop for a second
and think,

05:40.340 --> 05:41.909
"Do I really need
anything?"

05:46.279 --> 05:48.181
Hello, Mrs. Huang.
I'm Tina.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.150
I thought it was time
we met.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.586
Well, if it isn't

05:52.620 --> 05:55.923
the mysterious,
overly-confident girlfriend.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.426
I prefer to think of myself
as your son's better half.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.260
Three-quarters, really.

06:01.261 --> 06:02.162
Eddie: I did it --

06:02.195 --> 06:04.632
7 animals, 1 sandwich.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.670
We flew too close to the sun,
my friend.

06:14.241 --> 06:15.676
Tina, what a pleasure
to meet you.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.445
The pleasure is all mine.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.947
Eddie's been dying for us
to meet, right?

06:19.980 --> 06:21.882
Yes! Tina, Ma.
Ma, Tina.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.283
You've met.
Uh, let's go to a movie!

06:23.316 --> 06:24.618
You're not wearing pants.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.286
It's a look.
Let's go!

06:26.319 --> 06:28.956
Nobody's going anywhere.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.024
I'm gonna take
this opportunity

06:31.058 --> 06:33.794
to get to know your special
little friend person.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.128
That's why I'm here.

06:35.162 --> 06:38.198
To get to know your special
little mother. Person.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.136
Your presence
is not required.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.238
Why don't you get
some air?

06:45.272 --> 06:47.107
You know, because of
all the fumigation.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.242
Yeah, s-- sounds good.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.311
Great. Hella cool.
T-t-t-t-totally.

06:51.344 --> 06:52.480
So...
Oh, God, no.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.148
Now that you're here,

06:55.182 --> 06:56.249
without calling,

06:56.283 --> 06:57.785
I'd be delighted
to hear

06:57.818 --> 06:59.620
your intentions
toward my son.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.455
And I'd be delighted
to hear

07:01.489 --> 07:03.757
your intentions
toward my boyfriend.

07:08.361 --> 07:09.597
No!

07:10.698 --> 07:11.832
This is perfect, Dad.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.134
The test said you're social,
enterprising,

07:14.167 --> 07:15.836
and we all know
you love hair.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.437
You're a natural barber.

07:17.471 --> 07:20.273
A fine coiffure
is a man's God-given right.

07:20.307 --> 07:21.675
Oh, well, just take
a quarter inch off the top.

07:21.709 --> 07:22.810
Or maybe even less.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.645
How about you just comb it?

07:24.678 --> 07:25.979
Don't worry,
I cut Brian's hair,

07:26.013 --> 07:26.780
and it looks great.

07:26.814 --> 07:27.948
I'm a slow grower.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.017
This will take months
to fill in.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.987
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.189
I just love it!
Very flattering.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.258
Very flattering.
Great job, Lou.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.259
Oh, I haven't started.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.628
That's why
you're the best.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.696
It doesn't look "done."

07:45.332 --> 07:46.299
I don't know.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.301
This isn't as fulfilling
as I'd hoped.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.037
Maybe barbarism
isn't for me.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.039
You did a great job
on my five o'clock shadow.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.173
Thanks, Trent.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.308
My talent
isn't in question.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.344
Let's just say,
I have the skill,
but not the will.

07:57.377 --> 07:58.879
That's me
and making baklava.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.714
Besides,
Orlando already has

08:00.748 --> 08:03.316
a surprising number of barbers
per capita.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.885
The Caribbean-adjacent
crosswinds

08:04.918 --> 08:06.954
are basically rocket fuel
for hair follicles.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.056
You sure know
your Orlando facts.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.791
You know what? I do.

08:10.824 --> 08:11.859
Marvin:
Hey.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.293
I forgot to tip you,
buddy.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.896
People are lovin' it!

08:19.166 --> 08:23.236
Man: One more inhale.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.405
And as you exhale,

08:25.438 --> 08:29.042
feel yourself relax
into your moment...

08:29.076 --> 08:31.478
of deepest...calm.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.379
Armageddon!

08:32.412 --> 08:33.581
Aah!
Aah!

08:33.614 --> 08:35.716
I was just about to sink
into my ocean of truth.

08:35.749 --> 08:36.850
Who cares?!

08:36.884 --> 08:38.719
Mom and Tina are meeting
for the first time!

08:38.752 --> 08:39.920
We're at DEFCON 5!

08:39.953 --> 08:41.889
Uh,
I think you mean DEFCON 1?

08:41.922 --> 08:43.591
DEFCON 5
means peacetime.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.859
What sense
does that make?

08:45.893 --> 08:47.828
5 should be worse
than 1.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.063
Focus! Two heavyweights
are in the ring.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.065
It's like Roe versus Wade
in there!

08:52.099 --> 08:53.366
I need to hear
what they're saying.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.368
Does anyone have a glass so
I can listen through the wall?

08:55.402 --> 08:57.437
That only works
in the movies.

08:57.470 --> 09:00.173
Just eavesdrop
through the air vent

09:00.207 --> 09:02.610
like a normal person.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.180
Sounds heated.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.182
Guess it's back
to kissing my pillow.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.483
Which I never did, ever.

09:11.585 --> 09:12.953
My money's on Mommy!

09:20.060 --> 09:22.095
Oh, my God.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.797
They've gone
full "Road House."

09:33.140 --> 09:34.374
What happened?
Who's hurt?

09:38.178 --> 09:39.446
We're fine.

09:39.479 --> 09:42.082
Turns out your mom and I
have a lot in common.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.551
We're both no-nonsense,
goal-oriented women

09:44.584 --> 09:45.786
with a common enemy...

09:45.819 --> 09:47.120
The sun!
The sun!

09:47.154 --> 09:48.455
Tina is great.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.390
She's not a dud like
all your other girlfriends.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.893
One he said
he met at camp.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.327
He never went to camp.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.964
But it sounded
like a fight.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.632
I heard someone
get slapped!

09:58.666 --> 09:59.767
Oh, that?

09:59.800 --> 10:01.635
He always makes
a monster sandwich

10:01.669 --> 10:03.403
when he's trying
not to study!

10:03.436 --> 10:04.672
Totally!

10:04.705 --> 10:06.406
I gotta push this kid
all the damn time

10:06.439 --> 10:07.741
to live up
to his potential!

10:07.775 --> 10:09.476
Yes, girl! Yes!

10:09.509 --> 10:10.410
Preach!

10:10.443 --> 10:11.611
Mmm -- mm.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.446
Strong smack.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.182
I like it. Respect.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.786
So you guys actually
like each other?

10:18.819 --> 10:20.688
Hey,
don't act so surprised.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.823
I'm very easy
to get along with.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.291
Some might even say
charming.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.292
They might.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.493
And they do.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.196
Great, this is awesome!

10:29.229 --> 10:30.798
Where'd I put my sandwich?

10:30.831 --> 10:33.466
Louis: And, uh,
coming up on your right,

10:33.500 --> 10:35.836
you'll see Carrot Top's
childhood home!

10:35.869 --> 10:37.705
This is
much more you, Dad.

10:37.738 --> 10:38.939
I know!

10:38.972 --> 10:40.974
Being a tour guide
combines my people skills,

10:41.008 --> 10:42.375
my passion for Orlando,

10:42.409 --> 10:45.145
and my secret desire
to wear a little headset.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.114
Thanks for
being my guinea pigs.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.215
I thought you were just

10:48.248 --> 10:49.817
giving us a ride
to Mommy and Me.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.152
Uh, you don't want to take
Colonial at this hour, Lou.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.888
Just pull a U-boat up ahead here
and take Edgewater.

10:54.922 --> 10:56.523
It's faster,
more efficient.

10:56.556 --> 10:57.490
Are you sure?

10:57.524 --> 10:59.026
I planned this route
very carefully.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.227
Coming up on your right

11:00.260 --> 11:02.495
is the worldwide headquarters
of Tupperware!

11:02.529 --> 11:03.663
Uh, can we pull over?

11:03.697 --> 11:05.065
I need to use the bathroom.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.133
Uh, can it wait?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.135
I have a whole spiel
about Earl Tupper

11:08.168 --> 11:10.738
and his clash with female CEO
Brownie Mae Wise --

11:10.771 --> 11:12.873
The first woman to make
the cover of Business Week.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.374
You're losing us, Lou!

11:14.407 --> 11:16.877
Oh, Marvin!
The babies!

11:16.910 --> 11:18.912
They're just saying
what we're all thinking!

11:18.946 --> 11:21.248
Uh, everyone, we are
in the middle of a tour.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.984
If you could please keep it down
for the other guests.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.585
Dad,
you just ran a stop sign.

11:25.618 --> 11:27.154
There'll be
another one!

11:27.187 --> 11:29.656
Uh...
Speaking of stop signs,

11:29.689 --> 11:32.592
the first one appeared in 1915
in Detroit, Michigan,

11:32.625 --> 11:34.027
a state that looks like
a mitten.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.095
No one cares!

11:35.128 --> 11:36.429
I have to pee!
Pull over!

11:52.079 --> 11:53.947
He does do that!
He so does.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.616
But he's been good today.

11:56.649 --> 11:59.086
Got through a whole chapter
without nodding off.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.588
I consider it a win if his book
is right-side up.

12:01.621 --> 12:04.191
He calls Geometry
"Shapes Class."

12:04.224 --> 12:05.425
Oh, shut up!

12:05.458 --> 12:06.960
You shut up!

12:06.994 --> 12:08.829
No, both of you shut up.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.535
This is my calling
for sure.

12:15.568 --> 12:16.970
A motivational speaker.

12:17.004 --> 12:19.272
Inspiring people
to live life to the fullest.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.208
You're like a tour guide,
but for people's lives.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.010
And I still get to use
the headset.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.815
...and then I won
the Golden Prune award.

12:27.848 --> 12:31.084
And, uh, that's just
a brief explanation of --

12:31.118 --> 12:33.320
Brief?!
How is 40 minutes brief?!

12:33.353 --> 12:36.756
...of, uh, how Cattleman's Ranch
Steakhouse,

12:36.790 --> 12:40.460
just off the I-4
and now open for breakfast,

12:40.493 --> 12:41.661
became a success.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.763
Oh, great!
A question.

12:43.797 --> 12:45.665
Is Zumba still
in here at 4:00?

12:49.336 --> 12:50.971
Um...

12:51.004 --> 12:54.474
It is said that
a journey of a thousand miles

12:54.507 --> 12:56.109
begins with
a single step.

12:56.143 --> 12:59.980
But, um, in reality,
a journey of a thousand miles

13:00.013 --> 13:01.648
should begin with a map!

13:05.352 --> 13:06.686
Hey, where are you going?

13:06.719 --> 13:07.855
Where are you going?

13:07.888 --> 13:09.489
Well, I'm trying
to motivate you!

13:09.522 --> 13:11.458
This is supposed to be
my next big thing!

13:11.491 --> 13:12.492
I'm inspiring!

13:12.525 --> 13:13.861
I respectfully disagree.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.029
Well...

13:18.498 --> 13:21.801
You know what?
He's right.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.971
Who am I
to give you advice?

13:24.004 --> 13:25.805
How can I help you
find your next chapter

13:25.839 --> 13:27.707
if I can't even
find mine?

13:30.377 --> 13:31.711
Maybe there isn't one.

13:31.744 --> 13:34.314
Maybe this is it.

13:34.347 --> 13:38.185
Maybe my next big thing
is just...death.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.288
Alright, you muffin-tops!

13:41.321 --> 13:43.323
Who's ready to Zumba?!

13:45.926 --> 13:46.960
Speaking of firsts,

13:46.994 --> 13:48.495
did I ever tell you
about my first kiss?

13:48.528 --> 13:50.063
You'd better be
about to!

13:50.097 --> 13:54.034
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no!

13:54.067 --> 13:56.469
...an overall sensation
of wet.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.737
Can you guys
please keep it down?

13:57.770 --> 13:59.539
I'm trying to study!

13:59.572 --> 14:01.041
What's happening to me?

14:01.074 --> 14:02.742
Oh, you're evolving!

14:02.775 --> 14:05.245
From a boy of nonsense
into a man of letters.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.847
I think
we should take a break.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.149
Let's go get a milkshake.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.517
Good idea.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.154
Coming, Jess?

14:17.790 --> 14:20.760
Our boy Eddie needs to step up
his course-load senior year.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.229
It's lucky
I look good in blue

14:22.262 --> 14:24.497
because I tell him that
until I'm blue in the face.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.766
Uh...
you look good in all colors.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.101
You're so observant.

14:28.135 --> 14:29.602
You actually don't look good
in orange, so...

14:29.636 --> 14:30.737
Whatever.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.539
Me? You're the one
who's observant.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.574
That's another
good observation!

14:39.812 --> 14:40.914
Did you know Jessica

14:40.948 --> 14:43.050
can get five dinners
out of one roast chicken?

14:43.083 --> 14:44.784
Another fun fact
about my mother.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.586
Will it ever get old?
Not to me!

14:46.619 --> 14:49.856
You're okay with me being
friends with your mom, right?

14:49.889 --> 14:52.292
You're not afraid of a little
harmless female bonding.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.394
What?!
I'm happy as can be.

14:59.799 --> 15:00.968
I thought it would be bad

15:01.001 --> 15:02.970
for my mom and my girlfriend
to hate each other,

15:03.003 --> 15:05.038
but them liking each other
is so much worse.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.740
Life's curveballs,
am I right?

15:07.774 --> 15:10.777
I mean, I barely get time alone
with my girlfriend anymore.

15:10.810 --> 15:12.645
Silver lining?
I'm friends with your dad,

15:12.679 --> 15:14.114
Tina's friends
with your mom,

15:14.147 --> 15:15.949
we introduce my sis Tracy
to your grandma,

15:15.983 --> 15:17.650
and we've got ourselves
a dinner party.

15:17.684 --> 15:18.952
What am I gonna do?

15:18.986 --> 15:20.087
At the rate they're going,

15:20.120 --> 15:21.654
Tina's gonna ask my mother
to prom.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.323
Not gonna lie,
I'm into that.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.092
I wanted to ask Short Linda
to prom,

15:25.125 --> 15:27.327
but she'd have to break up
with Thick-Neck Chris.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.963
That's it!
That's what I have to do.

15:29.997 --> 15:30.998
I have
to break them up!

15:31.031 --> 15:32.799
Dude, you're crazy.

15:32.832 --> 15:35.335
What Thick-Neck Chris has
with Short Linda is real.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.503
No.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.571
I need to break up my mother
and my girlfriend.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.240
Okay, gotta ask --

15:40.273 --> 15:41.808
why do we call her
Short Linda?

15:41.841 --> 15:42.976
She's 6-feet tall.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.077
But very curt.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.678
Lotta one-word answers.

15:48.181 --> 15:51.651
Hunting ground of notorious
serial killer Ted Bundy?

15:51.684 --> 15:54.287
Well, this was unwise.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.856
You don't have to
check up on me, I'm fine.

15:56.889 --> 15:58.825
I rolled the dice
on something new,

15:58.858 --> 16:00.460
and they came up
snake eyes.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.661
Are snake eyes bad?

16:02.729 --> 16:03.830
I don't know.
I think so.

16:03.863 --> 16:04.931
Snakes are bad.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.133
Well, I just came by
to tell you

16:06.166 --> 16:07.200
I'm quitting Drama.

16:07.234 --> 16:08.701
What? Why?

16:08.735 --> 16:10.137
I auditioned for
"42nd Street,"

16:10.170 --> 16:11.504
and I couldn't do
a high kick.

16:11.538 --> 16:12.505
Guess I'm bad at acting.

16:12.539 --> 16:13.806
Son,
you can't just give up

16:13.840 --> 16:15.775
because things don't
immediately go your way.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.444
I just really wanted it
to work out.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.511
And it will one day.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.280
But only
if you don't give up.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.448
If you walk away,

16:21.481 --> 16:23.216
how will you ever know
what wonderful opportunities

16:23.250 --> 16:24.717
might be
just around the corner?

16:24.751 --> 16:26.019
That's good advice.

16:26.853 --> 16:27.887
Maybe you should take it.

16:28.721 --> 16:29.689
Me?

16:29.722 --> 16:30.823
I'm not quitting Drama.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.325
I made up
that whole story.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.661
I kick great!

16:34.694 --> 16:36.363
Whoa.
Yeah.

16:36.396 --> 16:39.032
I just want you to keep hunting
for your next challenge,

16:39.066 --> 16:40.533
no matter
how long it takes.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.569
You deserve
to find your passion.

16:42.602 --> 16:43.336
Thanks, son.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.671
Your support means a lot.

16:45.938 --> 16:48.475
You get your high kick
from your old man, you know.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.178
My side of the family
is famous for our loose groins.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.682
Hey, here's a thought.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.884
How about today
we study to music?

16:59.952 --> 17:01.654
I said study to music!

17:04.791 --> 17:07.427
The whole time I thought
she was in silent contemplation,

17:07.460 --> 17:09.129
she's just been snoozing!

17:10.197 --> 17:11.498
* Baby, baby *

17:11.531 --> 17:12.565
* I'm taken with the notion *

17:12.599 --> 17:14.267
Oh, no, Amy Grant?

17:14.301 --> 17:15.368
I'm sorry, Tina.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.437
I forgot how much
you hate Amy Grant.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.838
Jessica: What?

17:18.871 --> 17:20.006
That can't be true!

17:20.039 --> 17:22.109
Amy Grant
has the voice of an angel!

17:22.142 --> 17:23.110
Tina!

17:23.143 --> 17:24.711
She's my mom's
favorite singer.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.779
You're basically saying
my mom has no taste.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.681
I haven't said anything.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.783
Are you just gonna sit there
and let this high school girl

17:30.817 --> 17:32.119
tell you you're tasteless?

17:32.152 --> 17:34.787
That's not the fiery
Keds-kicking tempest I know.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.689
Tempest?

17:36.723 --> 17:38.158
Eddie, what is this?

17:39.159 --> 17:40.960
He's trying,

17:40.993 --> 17:42.595
with the subtlety
of an elephant,

17:42.629 --> 17:44.097
to cause friction
between us.

17:44.131 --> 17:45.932
So what?

17:45.965 --> 17:47.567
You're not okay
with us hanging out?

17:47.600 --> 17:48.968
You lied to me?

17:49.001 --> 17:50.437
I plead the fourth.

17:50.470 --> 17:53.140
Oh, he's so close
to knowing stuff.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.641
First
you don't want us to meet,

17:54.674 --> 17:56.276
and then when we do
and get along,

17:56.309 --> 17:57.144
you try to ruin it?

17:57.177 --> 17:59.279
What's wrong with you?

17:59.312 --> 18:00.813
* The birds above
are singing you a chorus *

18:00.847 --> 18:04.617
Whoa, feeling
a lotta red auras in here.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.554
* Baby,
I'm so glad you're mine *

18:07.587 --> 18:09.656
You didn't want me
to meet Tina?

18:09.689 --> 18:10.490
Of course not.

18:10.523 --> 18:11.791
You have strong opinions

18:11.824 --> 18:13.960
which you express hourly
at peak volume.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.562
It's called confidence.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.496
It's a gift.

18:16.529 --> 18:17.797
I'm sorry.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.333
I just thought you might
ruin my relationship.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.334
What?

18:21.368 --> 18:22.935
I would never do that.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.571
Well, it doesn't matter.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.274
I already ruined everything
all on my own.

18:28.808 --> 18:32.011
Okay, I may have been pushing it
a little bit with Tina.

18:32.044 --> 18:33.946
Did you really
have to braid her hair?

18:33.980 --> 18:35.782
You don't know
a woman's true beauty

18:35.815 --> 18:37.450
until you see her neck.

18:38.385 --> 18:40.620
I just wanted us
to get along

18:40.653 --> 18:42.922
because I knew how much
you liked her.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.023
How?

18:44.056 --> 18:45.692
I barely told you
about her.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.327
That's how I knew.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.697
And I know
why you like her.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.465
Because she's like me --

18:52.499 --> 18:54.201
direct, smart,

18:54.234 --> 18:56.469
and you always know
what's on her mind.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.472
Yeah, well, right now,
she's thinking she hates me.

18:59.506 --> 19:00.607
No, she's not.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.276
She obviously
cares about you a lot.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.478
Another thing
we have in common.

19:05.512 --> 19:06.979
Now go fix this.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.982
Oh, and Eddie...?

19:10.016 --> 19:12.685
Don't ever weaponize Amy Grant
again.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.056
Before you cut me out
of all your photos,

19:17.089 --> 19:18.991
I wanted to say
I'm really sorry.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.127
And I understand if you want
to break up with me.

19:22.529 --> 19:23.496
If I broke up with you

19:23.530 --> 19:25.131
every time
you did something weird,

19:25.164 --> 19:26.633
we wouldn't have lasted
an hour.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.134
Yeah.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.802
Props for tolerance.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.304
I just want you
to be honest.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.372
You should have told me

19:32.405 --> 19:33.806
you were nervous
about me meeting your mom.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.242
I know.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.809
And that you'd rather
hang out on our own.

19:36.843 --> 19:37.810
I would too.

19:37.844 --> 19:38.978
Really?

19:39.011 --> 19:40.413
Of course.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.382
I like Jessica,
but I'm dating you.

19:42.415 --> 19:45.352
I laid it on a little thick
because she's your mom.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.919
I want to get along.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.656
But between you and me,
she braids way too tight.

19:49.689 --> 19:50.890
I liked you in braids.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.492
You looked kinda like
the Wendy's girl --

19:52.525 --> 19:54.661
the hottest
of the fast-food mascots.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.729
Do you ever stop
thinking about burgers?

19:56.763 --> 19:58.231
Sometimes
I think about sliders.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.632
Do sliders
count as burgers?

20:00.533 --> 20:02.001
There's no correct answer.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.670
It's an eternal debate.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.377
You want to listen?

20:10.410 --> 20:11.411
Buck a minute.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.045
I got to get your chair
a bell.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.255
I think male modeling
is out.

20:22.289 --> 20:24.090
I've been told
I have feminine ankles.

20:24.123 --> 20:24.957
Mom?

20:25.825 --> 20:27.460
Louis Huang?

20:27.494 --> 20:28.795
I've been looking for you!

20:28.828 --> 20:30.363
I was actually at the talk
you gave the other night.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.398
My name's Tom.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.033
Were you the one
who threw the smoothie at me?

20:34.066 --> 20:35.802
I was taken aback.
Those are not cheap.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.104
You've inspired me
to chase my dreams,

20:38.137 --> 20:40.740
and I was thinking
maybe you'd like to invest

20:40.773 --> 20:41.741
in my new business.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.144
Well, I'm flattered.
Lay it on me.

20:45.177 --> 20:46.613
It's a website

20:46.646 --> 20:48.615
where a person
has their own space

20:48.648 --> 20:51.117
to post pictures and notes

20:51.150 --> 20:53.886
that they can share
with friends and family.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.959
Uh, they can already do that
through a little company

20:59.992 --> 21:01.461
called The United States
Postal Service.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.163
Well, I mean,
this is...

21:04.196 --> 21:06.666
I'm gonna have to pass.
Thanks for stopping by.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.168
Keep thinking.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.305
Okay.

21:12.339 --> 21:14.073
Oof.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.141
Can you imagine?

21:15.174 --> 21:16.643
Who wants to look
at other people's photos

21:16.676 --> 21:17.677
on the computer?

21:20.112 --> 21:22.682
That's so dumb.

21:23.516 --> 21:24.651
Oh, gosh.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.386
What an idiot.
