00:03.300 --> 00:06.400
(<i>sniffing </i>)

00:09.500 --> 00:11.934
Principal Lawler,
is someone being

00:11.934 --> 00:13.934
a little bit nosy?

00:16.100 --> 00:17.500
Pipe down, Miss Daniels.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.100
I am<i>pretty perturbed,</i>

00:20.100 --> 00:23.500
because the Gourmet Cooking Club
is missing a very<i>expensive,</i>

00:23.500 --> 00:24.767
very<i>pungent</i>

00:24.767 --> 00:25.800
<i>Parmesan.</i>

00:25.800 --> 00:28.300
And I intend to sniff it out.

00:28.300 --> 00:31.767
You mean to tell me
somebody jacked some
stanky cheese?

00:31.767 --> 00:34.000
<i>Precisely.</i>

00:34.000 --> 00:36.567
Dude, man, you<i>had</i>
to ask. Why?

00:36.567 --> 00:38.700
Things need to
tighten up around here.

00:38.700 --> 00:41.367
People come to school
like it's one big<i>party.</i>

00:53.233 --> 00:55.500
Why didn't y'all tell me
it was Mr. Lawler?

00:55.500 --> 00:58.133
Miss<i>Baxter, </i>I would
<i>appreciate </i>it

00:58.133 --> 01:00.200
if you would dress
and act<i>appropriately.</i>

01:00.200 --> 01:03.000
Um, well, what's wrong
with the way I dress?

01:03.000 --> 01:05.500
It's distracting to
the learning<i>process.</i>

you're not thinking

01:26.600 --> 01:28.500
of making everyone wear
uniforms, are you?

01:28.500 --> 01:32.233
I wasn't, but that
is a<i>splendid proposal.</i>

02:56.834 --> 02:59.567
Rae, you know
this is all of your fault.

02:59.567 --> 03:01.800
I know, but you guys didn't have
to volunteer to model.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.100
What?
Volunteer?

03:03.100 --> 03:05.100
Rae, he threatened to
put us on<i>suspension.</i>

03:06.233 --> 03:07.500
Move!

03:07.500 --> 03:09.700
Alana's coming through.

03:09.700 --> 03:10.867
Yo, Mr. Principal,

03:10.867 --> 03:13.100
me and my girls
already got a uniform.

03:13.100 --> 03:15.033
Well, from now on,
you and your<i>posse</i>

03:15.033 --> 03:17.400
will be spending less time
<i>picking </i>out clothes

03:17.400 --> 03:21.600
and more time<i>improving </i>your
<i>pitiful </i>grade<i>point </i>averages.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.934
Uh, excuse me, sir.

03:22.934 --> 03:24.667
Alana would appreciate it

03:24.667 --> 03:27.000
if you would say it,
not spray it.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.400
I don't get your<i>point.</i>

03:32.233 --> 03:35.700
You know,
I never told y'all this...

03:35.700 --> 03:37.600
but I hate my knees.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.100
And you know what?
You shouldn't have to show them.

03:40.100 --> 03:42.734
Yeah, and we shouldn't
have to look at them.

03:42.734 --> 03:44.133
No, Chelsea.

03:44.133 --> 03:47.467
No, I'm saying nobody should
tell us what to wear, right?

03:47.467 --> 03:49.967
ALL STUDENTS:
Right!

03:49.967 --> 03:51.734
Oh, hey, y'all.

03:51.734 --> 03:53.367
No, no, listen
to what I'm saying.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.567
We should not have to
walk around this school

03:55.567 --> 03:57.000
looking the same, right?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.300
ALL:
Right!

03:58.300 --> 04:00.600
So, tomorrow, we need to make
a statement.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.800
Yeah, sure,
we'll wear
the uniforms,

04:02.800 --> 04:03.900
but we'll wear them our way.

04:03.900 --> 04:05.100
ALL:
Right.

04:05.100 --> 04:08.300
We will take that uniform,
and we will

04:08.300 --> 04:09.500
customize...

04:09.500 --> 04:11.133
(<i>affirmative shouting </i>)

04:11.133 --> 04:14.200
We will accessorize...

04:14.200 --> 04:15.300
ALL:
Right!

04:15.300 --> 04:16.700
I am talking about

04:16.700 --> 04:19.200
individualize...

04:19.200 --> 04:20.400
ALL:
Right!

04:20.400 --> 04:24.100
Funk-ification
to the highest level.

04:24.100 --> 04:25.367
Get it!

04:25.367 --> 04:26.400
All with me?

04:26.400 --> 04:28.567
ALL:
Yeah!

04:28.567 --> 04:31.834
(<i>whooping </i>)

04:35.200 --> 04:37.000
(<i>cheeping </i>)

04:37.000 --> 04:38.700
How come<i>I </i>never get
any mail?

04:38.700 --> 04:40.200
You ever write anybody?

04:40.200 --> 04:41.233
Nope.

04:41.233 --> 04:43.500
Well, there you go.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.867
Hey, look,
this is for Lionel.

04:46.867 --> 04:48.400
You're a rat.

04:48.400 --> 04:51.033
I know you never wrote anybody.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.200
Look, it's a credit card!

04:55.200 --> 04:58.100
My parents use them
when they don't have any money.

04:58.100 --> 05:00.800
Lionel doesn't have any money.

05:01.967 --> 05:03.400
But he does now.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.867
Ch-ching.

05:04.867 --> 05:06.467
Big baby!

05:11.133 --> 05:12.500
Today's the day, people.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.000
It is protest day.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.600
Let's stand up and be counted.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.200
One...

05:22.000 --> 05:23.200
Wha-what?

05:23.200 --> 05:24.600
Anyone...

05:24.600 --> 05:25.967
can I... can I get...

05:25.967 --> 05:27.400
can I get
an untucked shirt?

05:27.400 --> 05:28.900
Can I get
some saggy pants?

05:28.900 --> 05:30.500
People,
work with me, people.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.300
Peo...

05:32.300 --> 05:34.000
Wow!

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Rae, you look fantastic.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.233
Thank you, thank you.

05:37.233 --> 05:38.400
I know I do, I know.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.567
How come you don't?

05:39.567 --> 05:41.300
Right, right.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.900
The protest.

05:42.900 --> 05:44.734
Funny story...

05:44.734 --> 05:46.033
(<i>laughs </i>)

05:46.033 --> 05:48.100
Yeah, thought about it.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.900
Bad idea!

05:49.900 --> 05:52.500
Then why didn't
you call me, Chels?

05:52.500 --> 05:54.600
Yeah, again.
Thought about it...

05:54.600 --> 05:55.867
bad idea.

05:55.867 --> 05:57.367
You know, I'm just...

05:57.367 --> 05:59.900
I'm sorry, Rae.
I thought you might be mad.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.200
Really?
Yeah.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.900
How do you think I feel now?!

06:02.900 --> 06:04.233
Well, come on!
That's exactly

06:04.233 --> 06:06.033
the reaction
I was hoping to avoid.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.767
Well, and what's
<i>your </i>excuse,

06:09.767 --> 06:12.734
Lil' Nasty Knees?

06:12.734 --> 06:15.233
Chelsea called
and told me it was off.

06:15.233 --> 06:17.367
Yes, and<i>he </i>took
it very well.

06:17.367 --> 06:18.900
That's all I'm saying.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.200
You know what? The whole school
wimped out on me.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.467
That's a shame.

06:22.467 --> 06:24.834
And my best friends
didn't even have my back.

06:28.667 --> 06:30.000
Miss Baxter?

06:30.000 --> 06:33.500
What you've done to your
uniform is<i>prohibited.</i>

06:33.500 --> 06:35.000
I know, Mr. Lawler,

06:35.000 --> 06:37.867
but I don't think it's fair that
we should be told what to wear.

06:37.867 --> 06:38.834
Okay, this is

06:38.834 --> 06:40.300
a protest.

06:43.200 --> 06:47.000
The world's loneliest protest.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.033
Well, you can<i>protest</i>
in detention.

06:53.867 --> 06:55.867
Good lookin' out, guys.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.400
(<i>giggling </i>)

07:09.467 --> 07:10.600
(<i>gasps </i>)

07:13.000 --> 07:14.567
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

07:14.567 --> 07:16.100
I didn't even touch you.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.834
Yeah, I'm just practicing.

07:17.834 --> 07:19.000
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow...!

07:19.000 --> 07:20.200
Don't worry, Baxter.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.200
We're not

07:21.200 --> 07:23.133
gonna mess you up.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.900
You guys joined my protest.

07:29.900 --> 07:32.000
Looks like we're
the only ones in this school

07:32.000 --> 07:33.400
that have any guts.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.033
All I know is,
my two best friends

07:35.033 --> 07:37.000
didn't even back me up,
and you guys did.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.300
Yeah, they dogged you<i>out!</i>

07:38.300 --> 07:40.200
Straight left you
hanging, Ma.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.500
Nice friends.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.467
Not!

07:43.467 --> 07:44.767
You know what, Baxter?

07:44.767 --> 07:46.734
You're not as big
of a spineless punk

07:46.734 --> 07:48.200
as I thought you were.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.667
Oh... stop it.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.600
You're gonna make my head big.

07:52.600 --> 07:53.767
Okay, keep coming.

07:53.767 --> 07:55.867
Now, let's cause
some trouble...

07:55.867 --> 07:57.133
Oh, wait. Okay.

07:57.133 --> 07:59.367
Um, I just want you to know,
kind of new to this,

07:59.367 --> 08:01.033
so I'm thinking
that we should start off

08:01.033 --> 08:02.600
with mischief
and work our way up.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.000
(<i>giggles </i>)

08:04.000 --> 08:05.400
Here's how it works.

08:05.400 --> 08:08.033
They mess us up,
and we mess them up.

08:08.033 --> 08:10.467
Oh, yeah.

08:10.467 --> 08:12.400
"Them," meaning...?

08:12.400 --> 08:14.200
Principal Lawler!

08:14.200 --> 08:15.967
He's gonna<i>pay.</i>

08:15.967 --> 08:18.500
(<i>cackling </i>)

08:18.500 --> 08:20.834
When Alana laughs,
the whole world laughs with her.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.200
Okay.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.500
(<i>laughing hysterically </i>)

08:23.500 --> 08:25.934
(<i>whining laugh </i>)

08:25.934 --> 08:28.033
And when Alana stops...

08:28.033 --> 08:30.000
Right, sorry.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.834
(<i>half-whispers </i>):
Right.

08:31.834 --> 08:33.400
Now, check this out.

08:36.300 --> 08:38.300
Oh, my goodness.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.934
You guys found
the missing cheese!

08:44.300 --> 08:46.700
You guys<i>stole</i>

08:46.700 --> 08:48.734
(<i>half-whispers </i>):
the missing cheese.

08:48.734 --> 08:50.467
Tight.

08:51.967 --> 08:54.467
And you're never gonna guess
what we're gonna do with it.

08:58.033 --> 09:01.233
(<i>gurgling </i>)

09:08.000 --> 09:09.700
Um... Alana?
Hey, girl...

09:09.700 --> 09:11.600
you're not thinking
of putting the cheese

09:11.600 --> 09:13.133
in the vent
and, you know,

09:13.133 --> 09:15.967
letting it get all hot
and stinky and bubbly,

09:15.967 --> 09:19.300
and you know, stinking up
the whole school, are you?

09:19.300 --> 09:20.867
Uh... no.

09:20.867 --> 09:24.133
Alana was going to grate it
over some angel hair pasta.

09:25.233 --> 09:28.467
But we like your idea
so much better.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.867
No, no, no! It wasn't...
it wasn't my idea.

09:30.867 --> 09:33.567
I was just saying it
'cause that's what I thought

09:33.567 --> 09:36.467
your evil minds were gonna
do, so I'm really sorry

09:36.467 --> 09:37.467
I ever...

09:37.467 --> 09:38.834
(<i>muffled yell </i>)

09:38.834 --> 09:41.400
Baxter, you talk too much.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.367
But you're an evil genius.

09:44.367 --> 09:46.000
Thank you.

09:47.934 --> 09:51.567
All right,
now this uniform thing stinks.

09:51.567 --> 09:54.467
And tomorrow,
thanks to Raven...

09:54.467 --> 09:55.800
(<i>giggling </i>)

09:55.800 --> 09:58.767
...the whole<i>school's</i>
gonna stink.

10:01.867 --> 10:05.233
Alana feels that if you have
a hand, you should put it in.

10:05.233 --> 10:06.767
Hey, guys,
I was kinda thinking

10:06.767 --> 10:08.400
we need to think
about this, okay?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.133
Sleep on it...
Okay, well, I'm in.

10:10.133 --> 10:11.300
I'm there with you.

10:11.300 --> 10:12.900
I... Ooh...

10:12.900 --> 10:15.300
(<i>giggling </i>)

10:22.834 --> 10:26.567
Okay, the coast
is, like, clear.

10:27.467 --> 10:28.600
(<i>sniffs </i>)

10:28.600 --> 10:31.200
Whoa, this is some
serious stank.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.900
(<i>speaks foreign word </i>)

10:39.900 --> 10:41.200
This is just beautiful.

10:41.200 --> 10:44.734
Tomorrow when they
turn on the heat,

10:44.734 --> 10:46.367
the school's gonna reek.

10:50.734 --> 10:52.033
Okay.

10:52.033 --> 10:53.567
The cheese is in the vent.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.567
This bad girl stuff's
a little hard on the back.

11:03.900 --> 11:05.300
(<i>doorbell rings </i>)

11:06.700 --> 11:08.600
Delivery.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.367
Oh.

11:10.367 --> 11:12.700
Ah, I know what that is.

11:12.700 --> 11:14.834
It's my birthday
next week and I bet you

11:14.834 --> 11:17.600
my wife got me that watch
I've been hinting about.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.467
Right? Right?
I just deliver them, sir.

11:22.300 --> 11:24.734
(<i>humming </i>)

11:29.500 --> 11:32.400
"Mr. Lionel Baxter"?

11:33.600 --> 11:35.500
Lionel?!

11:41.800 --> 11:44.400
Ever since Lionel
got his credit card,

11:44.400 --> 11:48.500
we are living large.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.500
(<i>knocking on door </i>)

11:49.500 --> 11:51.300
Cory...

11:51.300 --> 11:56.133
why does Lionel have
a little leather jacket?

11:56.133 --> 12:01.900
So he can look cool
on his little motorcycle.

12:01.900 --> 12:04.567
Son, where has
all this stuff come from?

12:04.567 --> 12:05.600
Nice, huh?

12:05.600 --> 12:07.000
My man William ordered it

12:07.000 --> 12:08.467
all from the internet.

12:10.033 --> 12:13.300
Life is good.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.033
Is life still gonna be good when
I find out how you paid for it?

12:16.033 --> 12:17.500
That's the beauty of it.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.600
It's all on the card.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.767
They gave a credit card
to a rat?

12:23.767 --> 12:25.033
It's platinum.

12:25.033 --> 12:27.734
Even I can't get
a platinum card.

12:27.734 --> 12:29.500
Do you know how
a credit card works?

12:30.834 --> 12:32.300
Obviously.

12:32.300 --> 12:35.500
Cory...

12:35.500 --> 12:37.000
when you use a credit card,

12:37.000 --> 12:39.100
oh, sure, you can buy stuff
with it now,

12:39.100 --> 12:42.300
but someone
has to pay for it later.

12:42.300 --> 12:45.867
(<i>scoffs </i>):
Who's that going to be?

12:45.867 --> 12:48.367
It's gonna be you.

12:48.367 --> 12:50.100
Me?

12:50.100 --> 12:53.033
I can't afford
all this stuff.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.934
Ah, now you get it.

12:54.934 --> 12:58.467
That's why all of this
stuff has to go back.

12:58.467 --> 12:59.600
Okay, Dad, we're sorry.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.000
We didn't know.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.934
I guess we got to take back
your birthday present, too.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.867
You got me a little
something-something?

13:06.867 --> 13:11.200
(<i>jingle plays </i>)

13:11.200 --> 13:13.033
You got me an
ice cream truck.

13:13.033 --> 13:14.834
Always thinking of you, Dad.

13:14.834 --> 13:17.133
You know this stuff
has got to go back.

13:17.133 --> 13:18.500
I know.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.300
(<i>jingle playing </i>)

13:20.300 --> 13:23.300
Right after we get
our Fudgie Pops.

13:25.900 --> 13:31.400
(<i>"Bad To The Bone" plays </i>)

13:47.500 --> 13:48.500
Raven?

13:48.500 --> 13:50.100
(<i>record scratches </i>)
Chelsea.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.300
Raven? Chelsea?

13:51.300 --> 13:53.100
Eddie.
Oh, Loca.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.100
Muffy.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.867
Alana feels this name thing

13:55.867 --> 13:57.467
should stop, like, now.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.400
Excuse me, Raven,
a word?

14:01.567 --> 14:04.200
Rae, why are you
hanging out with them?

14:04.200 --> 14:06.734
Unlike some people,
when they said they're
gonna do something,

14:06.734 --> 14:08.033
they actually come through.

14:08.033 --> 14:10.800
Rae, you still tripping off
the whole uniform thing?

14:10.800 --> 14:13.033
At least my girls
got my biz-ack.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.734
I cannot believe you are
actually dropping us

14:19.734 --> 14:22.000
just because we
weren't down with
your stupid protest.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.100
Oh, now it's stupid?

14:23.100 --> 14:24.600
It was stupid then,
too, Rae.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.900
You guys were cheering for me.
What were you thinking?

14:26.900 --> 14:28.100
Well, I don't know.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.467
You know, Rae,
sometimes it's really hard

14:29.467 --> 14:32.734
to think and cheer
at the same time.

14:34.734 --> 14:38.000
When a friend's counting on you,
you shouldn't have to think.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.300
Raven, you coming?

14:39.300 --> 14:42.233
Yeah, I'll be right there,
home skillet biscuit.

14:47.767 --> 14:52.567
Man, it's always hard
a good girl go biz-ad.

14:52.567 --> 14:56.767
(<i>"Bad To The Bone" plays </i>)

15:00.400 --> 15:01.600
Loca, time.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.100
Heat comes on
in two minutes.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.700
Yep.

15:06.700 --> 15:08.934
This school
is gonna smell foul.

15:11.400 --> 15:14.000
Now all we have to do is get rid
of the cheese wrappers.

15:16.834 --> 15:21.734
One for Eddie
and one for Chelsea.

15:24.767 --> 15:26.100
Hey, Alana.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.467
Hey, you're not thinking of
putting the cheese wrappers

15:28.467 --> 15:30.500
in Eddie and Chelsea's locker
trying to frame them, are you?

15:30.500 --> 15:32.500
No, we're just gonna
put them in the trash can.

15:32.500 --> 15:35.200
But we like your idea
so much better.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.767
Unh! I did it again.

15:36.767 --> 15:39.767
Listen, my friends
had nothing to do with it.

15:39.767 --> 15:41.000
Oh, I know.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
You are cold, girl.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.367
I love it.

15:44.367 --> 15:46.800
Here comes the heat.

15:48.667 --> 15:50.300
Let's get framing, girls.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.500
(<i>groans </i>):
It's locked!

15:59.500 --> 16:01.834
I got to stop that cheese.

16:05.033 --> 16:07.300
Hey, uh...

16:07.300 --> 16:10.600
Stretch.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.767
I need a lift, man.

16:16.834 --> 16:18.900
(<i>laughs </i>)

16:18.900 --> 16:21.200
Thanks, Stretch,
this is my floor.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.834
Okay, little cheese
is coming home with me.

16:23.834 --> 16:25.100
Come on.

16:27.233 --> 16:28.867
(<i>clang </i>)
Ow!

16:28.867 --> 16:30.033
Ooh.

16:30.033 --> 16:31.133
Stretch, I'm sorry.

16:31.133 --> 16:32.300
Sorry, Stretch.

16:32.300 --> 16:35.133
Hold on, hold on. Okay...

16:36.033 --> 16:38.200
Stay still. Okay.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.367
Oh, yeah, come to mama.

16:43.367 --> 16:45.233
Come here.

16:45.233 --> 16:46.567
Stretch, a little higher.

16:52.233 --> 16:56.400
It had to be a wheel of cheese.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.700
Hey, Stretch...

16:58.700 --> 17:00.767
got another job for you.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.133
Ooh, dead bugs.
Dead bugs.

17:05.133 --> 17:07.100
Live bugs! Live bugs!

17:10.400 --> 17:12.300
Okay. Which way?

17:12.300 --> 17:15.200
(<i>sniffs </i>)

17:18.200 --> 17:20.300
Definitely this way.

17:22.033 --> 17:23.500
Okay.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.800
Whoo!

17:24.800 --> 17:26.600
Hot.

17:26.600 --> 17:28.400
Okay.

17:37.133 --> 17:40.967
Here you are, you nasty.

17:40.967 --> 17:43.300
Come to mama.

17:43.300 --> 17:45.600
Come to mama.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.567
Oh, it's getting kind of small.

17:48.567 --> 17:49.934
Ooh...

17:49.934 --> 17:52.867
I can't move my arms.

17:52.867 --> 17:54.567
(<i>grunts </i>)

17:54.567 --> 17:56.100
Okay... ooh.

17:56.100 --> 17:57.600
Okay, what do I do?

17:57.600 --> 17:59.200
How do I get rid of it?

18:02.900 --> 18:05.133
Sorry, stomach.

18:12.367 --> 18:15.367
Oh, the horror!

18:21.200 --> 18:25.734
One for Eddie
and one for Chelsea.

18:25.734 --> 18:28.233
Hey, what are you doing
at our lockers?

18:28.233 --> 18:31.200
You're about to find out
right now.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.300
Excuse me, Principal Lawler.

18:33.300 --> 18:36.600
Alana has some
cheese-related information.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.000
Ah, the pilfered parmesan.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.200
Proceed.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.700
If you're wondering

18:43.700 --> 18:46.033
why it smells, like,
a little funky up in here,

18:46.033 --> 18:47.500
it's Chelsea and Eddie.

18:48.467 --> 18:49.867
I don't smell anything.

18:49.867 --> 18:51.467
(<i>sniffs </i>)

18:51.467 --> 18:53.100
Me neither.

18:53.100 --> 18:56.367
Something doesn't stink.

18:56.367 --> 18:58.967
Oh, something stinks
all right.

18:58.967 --> 19:00.500
Where's Raven?

19:01.567 --> 19:03.800
(<i>cries </i>):
One more bite...

19:03.800 --> 19:05.567
and it's over.

19:05.567 --> 19:07.600
(<i>cries </i>):
It's over.

19:13.367 --> 19:18.233
(<i>rumbling </i>)

19:22.667 --> 19:25.500
Rae, Rae, Rae.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.000
How y'all doing?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.500
Ms. Baxter,
dropping from the ceiling

19:30.500 --> 19:31.767
is strictly prohibited.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.000
Where's the cheese, Baxter?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
What cheese?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.500
Look, we did not
steal that cheese

19:37.500 --> 19:39.567
for you to go and
mess up our plan.

19:39.567 --> 19:42.300
You stole the cheese?

19:42.300 --> 19:45.700
Alana can't believe
she just said that out loud.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.767
No, no, Mr. Lawler,
listen, okay?

19:47.767 --> 19:49.233
I just want you to know that

19:49.233 --> 19:52.300
Eddie and Chelsea
had nothing to do
with this, okay?

19:52.300 --> 19:55.500
It was my idea to put the cheese
in the vent and then

19:55.500 --> 19:57.900
I had to get it out before
it stunk up the whole school

19:57.900 --> 19:59.200
and you blame it on my friends.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.600
Very touching.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.734
Now the perpetrator's parents
will be hearing from me

20:03.734 --> 20:04.934
about your punishment.

20:04.934 --> 20:07.500
And you, Ms. Baxter,
prepare for detention.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.500
Whoa, now wait a minute.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.867
None of this
would've happened

20:10.867 --> 20:12.500
if we'd backed Raven
up in the first place.
Yeah.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.467
Now if she goes to detention,
we all going with her.

20:14.467 --> 20:15.700
Who's with me?

20:15.700 --> 20:18.000
I am!

20:19.100 --> 20:22.300
Y'all the worst
crowd ever!

20:22.300 --> 20:23.767
Detention for three, please.

20:23.767 --> 20:25.600
I'll prepare the paperwork.

20:25.600 --> 20:26.667
Pronto.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.500
Yo, Baxter.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.700
Thanks for not ratting us out.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.567
Guess you're still
one of us?

20:34.567 --> 20:38.834
Actually...

20:38.834 --> 20:41.100
I think more of one of them.

20:41.100 --> 20:43.100
(<i>laughs </i>)

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
(<i>laughing </i>)

20:46.000 --> 20:49.133
Alana's laughing
to hide her pain.

20:49.133 --> 20:52.834
Or... maybe she just
thought it was funny.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.200
(<i>laughs </i>)

21:02.600 --> 21:04.400
Maybe we need one of those.

21:09.667 --> 21:12.800
Like we're ever gonna be
able to do that again.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.600
Who loves cheese?

21:21.367 --> 21:23.367
Late, late, late!
Late, late, late!

21:23.367 --> 21:24.867
Daddy don't leave me!

21:24.867 --> 21:26.934
Whoa, Raven, you got a
letter from the school.

21:26.934 --> 21:28.100
Mama, it's the ceiling.

21:28.100 --> 21:30.000
I told you I'd pay for
the whole thing, okay?

21:30.000 --> 21:30.967
Don't use a credit card.

21:30.967 --> 21:32.734
Okay, got to go.
Love you, bye.

21:32.734 --> 21:34.100
I just thought
you'd want to know

21:34.100 --> 21:36.000
that the school board
overruled the principal

21:36.000 --> 21:38.200
and they canceled
the school uniforms.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.900
What?!

21:42.900 --> 21:45.233
You know what?
I can make this happen.

21:45.233 --> 21:46.567
I can make it happen.

21:46.567 --> 21:48.400
Hey, it is not cold in here,
you don't need that.

21:48.400 --> 21:51.300
Girl, I love your hat.
It would look even better on me.

21:51.300 --> 21:55.400
Girl, you do not need
these inside, trust me. I do.

21:55.400 --> 21:59.400
Oh, yay. Fabulous.
