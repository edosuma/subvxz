00:27.208 --> 00:29.875
<i>We think love is declared</i>
<i>with flowers and chocolates,</i>

00:31.416 --> 00:34.250
<i>but you can also</i>
<i>declare your love with a hammer.</i>

00:35.083 --> 00:36.583
<i>Or with an angle grinder.</i>

00:49.916 --> 00:53.250
<i>Kidnapping a police officer</i>
<i>can be a declaration of love.</i>

00:53.791 --> 00:56.208
<i>Saving him from the bottom of his pool</i>

00:56.625 --> 00:57.500
<i>is another.</i>

01:12.416 --> 01:14.166
What's going on down there?

01:14.625 --> 01:15.791
What are you doing?

01:16.708 --> 01:19.291
-Pretend we're drunk.
-No, I won't pretend.

01:19.375 --> 01:21.625
Play drunk or I'll snap your neck.

01:22.166 --> 01:24.958
-Have you no shame?
-I'm calling the police!

01:28.083 --> 01:31.125
I am the police, ma'am.

01:31.208 --> 01:35.208
-That's Benito!
-Do you want to call them? Ring, ring.

01:35.291 --> 01:36.833
What are you doing?

01:38.166 --> 01:39.166
Pretend, come on.

01:49.625 --> 01:51.333
The house is full of them.

01:52.875 --> 01:54.458
And so is your car.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.416
And your wife's car.

01:57.750 --> 02:00.166
It looks like C-4, but it's only plastic.

02:00.916 --> 02:04.291
That's your alibi.
You wouldn't be a criminal, you'd be...

02:04.375 --> 02:07.041
a scared father, and they'll understand.

02:07.708 --> 02:11.500
Once I get out, I'll report you
and come back with 3,000 officers.

02:11.583 --> 02:13.333
We can also use real C-4.

02:14.125 --> 02:15.958
Anywhere you can imagine.

02:24.208 --> 02:25.791
Don't get the wrong idea.

02:25.875 --> 02:28.541
We don't want you
to do this for money, but...

02:28.625 --> 02:32.166
we understand the inconvenience
this could cause.

02:32.250 --> 02:33.416
One million euros.

02:33.500 --> 02:36.333
With this money and the alibi,
you're free to choose

02:36.416 --> 02:37.916
who you want to be with.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.500
With a woman
who illegally arrests people,

02:40.958 --> 02:42.041
tortures them,

02:42.291 --> 02:45.041
and abuses the power given to her
by the Constitution.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.250
Or with us.

02:57.125 --> 03:00.208
-Now you'll answer some questions.
-I'll decide that.

03:01.708 --> 03:04.875
Is Inspector Murillo alive?

03:07.166 --> 03:08.208
She might be.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.416
Is she in the tent?

03:13.833 --> 03:14.708
She might be.

03:15.791 --> 03:20.041
I just need you to let her know
that the Professor knows she's alive.

03:20.125 --> 03:21.541
She won't believe me.

03:22.375 --> 03:25.291
If I'd been with you,
why wouldn't I have arrested you?

03:27.208 --> 03:31.666
If she sees you wearing this watch,
she'll believe you.

03:32.208 --> 03:35.791
<i>Because when love is concerned,</i>
<i>there's always a ticking clock.</i>

03:37.208 --> 03:38.958
<i>There's always a countdown.</i>

03:41.000 --> 03:42.708
<i>Loving someone is not enough,</i>

03:44.083 --> 03:45.791
<i>you have to make it in time.</i>

04:08.416 --> 04:09.375
What's that?

04:11.208 --> 04:15.666
-For when she wakes up.
-That's a beautiful gift and gesture.

04:18.333 --> 04:21.083
She said she wouldn't touch me
with a ten-foot pole.

04:28.375 --> 04:30.416
<i>Let me give you a piece of advice:</i>

04:33.750 --> 04:35.833
<i>don't fall in love during a heist.</i> 

04:42.208 --> 04:43.458
<i>It's bad luck.</i>

05:48.458 --> 05:50.041
Paulita!

05:51.250 --> 05:52.625
Miss Mariví!

05:54.625 --> 05:59.000
MINDANAO
DAY 1 OF THE HEIST

05:59.083 --> 06:00.250
The phone!

06:01.791 --> 06:03.791
SOUTHERN SPAIN
DAY 1 OF THE HEIST

06:03.875 --> 06:04.708
<i>Mom?</i>

06:05.541 --> 06:07.041
Paula, honey.

06:07.125 --> 06:09.416
<i>How are you? What did you do today?</i>

06:09.583 --> 06:11.250
The same as yesterday, Mom.

06:11.333 --> 06:13.875
I'm sure you did something great today.

06:13.958 --> 06:16.833
<i>-Tell me something.</i>
-I can't think of anything.

06:17.291 --> 06:18.500
Do you miss me?

06:18.625 --> 06:19.500
<i>Yes.</i>

06:20.041 --> 06:22.291
<i>What's wrong?</i>
<i>You're watching TV, aren't you?</i>

06:22.375 --> 06:24.458
No, I was playing with Grandma.

06:24.875 --> 06:26.083
Put her on, please.

06:26.458 --> 06:28.041
<i>OK. Grandma!</i>

06:28.500 --> 06:29.500
Darling?

06:30.333 --> 06:33.291
Is Paula all right? She sounds odd.

06:33.375 --> 06:34.500
I don't know.

06:35.833 --> 06:36.750
She seems fine.

06:37.500 --> 06:40.333
<i>But you can talk to her</i>
<i>when you come for dinner.</i>

06:42.541 --> 06:45.375
-Sure, Mom.
-And don't forget to buy some bread.

07:30.125 --> 07:31.666
It's six in the morning.

07:32.708 --> 07:37.333
The ambulance is in the crime lab.
In about an hour, Alberto will be there.

07:37.416 --> 07:38.666
Like a bloodhound.

07:41.083 --> 07:44.250
Sniffing out the trail of his new prey:
your daughter.

07:44.583 --> 07:48.541
Do you think I leave her address
stuck on the fridge with a magnet?

07:48.625 --> 07:50.916
I think you feel guilty
for being a bad mother.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.583
You don't simply go off...

07:53.250 --> 07:55.750
away on a heist for weeks and not call.

07:56.208 --> 07:59.041
Am I wrong?
What about your bad-daughter complex?

07:59.125 --> 08:00.416
Because your mom...

08:01.458 --> 08:04.708
You can't even leave her
to eat a yogurt on her own.

08:05.458 --> 08:09.208
How did you do it?
How did you call from the motor home?

08:09.291 --> 08:12.333
This may surprise you,
but we thought this through.

08:12.875 --> 08:15.833
Alberto can go in
like a pig in search of truffles.

08:15.916 --> 08:17.416
He won't find a thing.

08:35.333 --> 08:40.291
-What happened to your head?
-I'm obsessed with the heist, Colonel.

08:41.166 --> 08:43.958
I wake up very early. I'm not sleeping.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.708
I was tying my shoelaces
and thinking about the heist,

08:48.791 --> 08:52.916
and as I stood up, I banged my head
on the window so hard I nearly broke it.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.333
You're like me, Antoñanzas.

08:57.708 --> 08:59.958
Even with the truce, I couldn't sleep.

09:00.041 --> 09:01.958
I was wide awake at 3:00 a.m.,

09:02.041 --> 09:04.916
wondering how the Professor
would ruin our day.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.416
I'm going in to see if Sierra needs--

09:07.500 --> 09:09.625
Murillo is in total isolation.

09:10.041 --> 09:14.250
I'm only going to go in
to give the inspector her coffee.

09:17.583 --> 09:20.125
Murillo can only have contact with Sierra.

09:20.208 --> 09:23.625
She didn't let her sleep all night.
She's wearing her down.

09:25.458 --> 09:27.125
Let's go for a coffee.

09:29.041 --> 09:32.250
A crime's worst enemy isn't the police.

09:33.416 --> 09:34.375
It's rushing.

09:35.750 --> 09:38.291
The motor home was clean as a whistle.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.708
You left it...

09:40.583 --> 09:41.500
like new.

09:42.208 --> 09:43.666
But the ambulance...

09:45.125 --> 09:47.208
You hauled ass out of there.

09:47.291 --> 09:51.166
There's always something left. Always.
A hair on the pillow...

09:51.500 --> 09:52.666
A sock...

09:52.958 --> 09:56.833
And then forensics arrives
with UV light and luminol, and... bang!

09:58.125 --> 09:59.166
Gotcha.

10:01.750 --> 10:02.833
I repeat my offer:

10:03.750 --> 10:07.958
I'll go there now and remove that hair
that'll lead us to your family.

10:08.583 --> 10:10.083
Or we wait for your ex...

10:10.916 --> 10:12.000
to fuck you over.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.250
You've got nothing.

10:20.166 --> 10:23.708
You're threatening me with
"Maybe we'll find something."

10:29.083 --> 10:33.000
You know what? Your pregnancy
has made you so high on estrogen

10:33.083 --> 10:36.333
that you feel like
the most optimistic woman in Spain.

10:37.291 --> 10:40.041
But that isn't meant for work.
It's for the delivery,

10:40.125 --> 10:41.583
which is fucking hard.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.083
What will you do when it's born?

10:49.208 --> 10:50.750
Is it a boy or a girl?

10:52.291 --> 10:53.375
You don't know?

10:56.250 --> 10:57.250
Poor thing.

11:08.791 --> 11:10.208
What the fuck happened?

11:11.041 --> 11:12.541
They were barefoot, man.

11:12.625 --> 11:14.166
Barefoot? Who?

11:14.250 --> 11:15.541
Rio and Stockholm.

11:16.250 --> 11:18.041
-So?
-What do you mean, "So?"

11:18.458 --> 11:20.541
Who goes barefoot during a heist?

11:21.291 --> 11:25.250
Taking your shoes off on a couch
in the middle of a heist is weird.

11:26.333 --> 11:27.458
Are you stupid?

11:37.416 --> 11:41.833
If they were thinking of fucking,
they'd fuck... not take their shoes off.

11:42.375 --> 11:43.250
Well...

11:44.416 --> 11:46.833
What were you doing in here last night?

11:51.791 --> 11:52.625
Well, this.

11:57.541 --> 11:59.541
-This is what you were doing?
-Yes.

12:05.833 --> 12:10.500
You beat a guy up,
completely change how she sees you,

12:11.416 --> 12:14.750
and you think giving her
a heart is going to fix it?

12:15.125 --> 12:16.458
What can I do then?

12:18.666 --> 12:19.750
Change.

12:22.625 --> 12:26.125
In her eyes... you're a bad guy now.

12:26.583 --> 12:29.958
A violent guy.
What made her fall in love with you?

12:31.708 --> 12:32.833
I shot her.

12:33.416 --> 12:36.166
I mean, I shot her in the leg
to save her life.

12:36.666 --> 12:37.833
To save her life.

12:39.291 --> 12:40.250
I don't know.

12:44.708 --> 12:46.416
I did a cool dance for her.

12:47.416 --> 12:50.583
-You did a dance for her?
-Yes. I danced for her.

12:51.291 --> 12:55.000
I told her stories.
We laughed a lot together.

12:57.541 --> 13:02.333
And...
how long is it since you told her stories?

13:02.416 --> 13:04.625
Since you made her laugh?

13:04.916 --> 13:07.625
How long since you danced for her?

13:21.625 --> 13:24.000
Hey, Rio, can you get me a black coffee?

13:25.916 --> 13:29.708
I came up with this plan.
You're safe thanks to me.

13:29.791 --> 13:31.291
How about some gratitude?

13:32.208 --> 13:34.291
You're tied up. Why don't you rest?

13:34.375 --> 13:37.041
Can I at least have some water, please?

13:38.041 --> 13:39.666
Just a bit of water.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.041
I'm sorry, but...

13:52.083 --> 13:52.916
Thanks.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.708
You look awful.

13:56.083 --> 13:57.041
Can't you sleep?

14:01.333 --> 14:04.750
How many times do you wake up at night?
Three, four, more?

14:11.458 --> 14:12.416
Hey, Rio...

14:13.291 --> 14:14.666
if you need anything...

14:15.250 --> 14:17.250
to talk or whatever, I'm here.

14:20.375 --> 14:21.333
Thank you.

14:30.666 --> 14:32.250
He's the weakest link.

14:32.666 --> 14:36.208
Palpitations,
excessive sweating, insomnia.

14:36.958 --> 14:39.250
Break free during his watch.

14:39.333 --> 14:41.875
He won't be capable
of pulling the trigger.

14:43.916 --> 14:47.083
What makes you think I won't kill you
as soon as I'm free?

14:47.166 --> 14:48.125
Well...

14:48.791 --> 14:50.291
I smashed your head in.

14:50.583 --> 14:52.250
You fucked my eyes up.

14:52.750 --> 14:55.666
That's a tie. A gentlemen's agreement.

14:55.750 --> 14:58.625
Are you asking me to trust you?

14:59.125 --> 15:02.375
What I'm saying is,
a truce has been declared out there.

15:02.541 --> 15:03.791
No armored vans are coming.

15:06.125 --> 15:08.125
It's a fucking cold war.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.500
-And we are captives.
-So?

15:11.541 --> 15:15.166
You should become
the agent of chaos we need.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.166
Like the creature in <i>Alien.</i>

15:22.416 --> 15:25.500
Like John McClane in <i>Die Hard.</i>

15:37.291 --> 15:38.708
STORM RESERVOIR
KEEP OUT

15:58.875 --> 15:59.833
Let's go.

16:31.333 --> 16:34.875
<i>When he got to the storm reservoir,</i>
<i>the Professor was thinking of Raquel,</i>

16:36.500 --> 16:39.666
<i>just like Alberto</i>
<i>as he stepped into the ambulance.</i>

16:43.291 --> 16:46.375
<i>It's strange how you can</i>
<i>think about one person,</i>

16:46.875 --> 16:50.541
<i>at the same time, in such different ways.</i>

16:52.083 --> 16:57.333
<i>They say love makes the world go round.</i>
<i>But hatred certainly isn't far behind.</i>

17:01.333 --> 17:02.666
<i>You were right.</i>

17:03.083 --> 17:04.291
<i>Lisbon is alive.</i>

17:07.125 --> 17:07.958
Where is she?

17:08.041 --> 17:10.958
In the tent.
I imagine she's being interrogated.

17:11.041 --> 17:13.625
-<i>How long can they keep her?</i>
-<i>I don't know.</i>

17:13.708 --> 17:16.750
<i>I don't think they'll stick</i>
<i>to the usual 72 hours.</i>

17:17.708 --> 17:19.666
<i>They'll transfer her at some point.</i>

17:19.958 --> 17:22.041
-Can you rescue her?
-<i>Not during a transfer.</i>

17:22.125 --> 17:26.083
It'd be stupid. We did it with you.
They'll expect it. It'd be suicide.

17:26.166 --> 17:27.666
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

17:28.666 --> 17:31.500
They have Lisbon there
with the whole plan in her head.

17:32.083 --> 17:34.583
<i>Including the place</i>
<i>you're calling me from.</i>

17:42.500 --> 17:43.500
Professor?

17:45.791 --> 17:46.833
I don't know.

17:49.166 --> 17:52.208
I'm so tired, Tokyo. I can't think.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.583
<i>But I'll find a solution. Don't worry.</i>

17:59.583 --> 18:02.208
I'm making ravioli. You need energy.

18:07.791 --> 18:09.708
-Is Palermo still tied up?
-Yes.

18:09.875 --> 18:12.083
I want you to go and tell him this...

18:12.166 --> 18:16.583
No, I'm not telling him anything.
He'd bite me like an animal.

18:17.041 --> 18:19.583
<i>Well, you'll have to.</i>
<i>Tell him exactly this:</i>

18:20.375 --> 18:25.291
"You have a message from the Professor.
Lisbon is alive.

18:25.375 --> 18:27.250
She's being held in the tent.

18:27.333 --> 18:30.000
I need you to think of a way to save her."

18:31.416 --> 18:33.583
-He won't do it.
-<i>Listen to me.</i>

18:33.666 --> 18:38.083
All I'm trying to do is to get Palermo
to fall back in love with the plan.

18:38.166 --> 18:40.166
<i>I need him back on our side.</i>

18:40.458 --> 18:45.208
Go tell him.
I'll think of something. Understood?

18:50.375 --> 18:51.375
Understood.

19:10.833 --> 19:14.000
I'm going to the bathroom.
Want to come with me, Sergio?

19:16.708 --> 19:22.333
Have you ever had the privilege
of an experienced man giving you fellatio?

19:32.041 --> 19:34.041
He's absolutely unpredictable.

19:34.416 --> 19:37.625
He simply offered you fellatio, gallantly.

19:37.708 --> 19:39.583
-He--
-You know what I mean.

19:39.666 --> 19:42.041
He's uncontrollable.
He's sick with egomania.

19:42.125 --> 19:43.458
He'll respect the hierarchy.

19:43.541 --> 19:46.708
He would in a heist
lasting two or three hours, or a night.

19:47.041 --> 19:49.000
We're talking about several days.

19:49.083 --> 19:51.750
Under infinitely higher pressure.

19:52.125 --> 19:54.125
-I can control Martín--
-You can't!

19:54.750 --> 19:58.333
-I've been doing it for years.
-You can't. He's an egomaniac.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.333
He's obsessed with power.

20:00.875 --> 20:02.875
That only means one thing:

20:03.833 --> 20:07.500
if he's not in charge,
he'll do anything to change that.

20:08.833 --> 20:12.750
And he won't hesitate to execute,
betray, or create chaos.

20:12.833 --> 20:17.750
He's an obsessive egomaniac,
he believes in himself, and he's a genius.

20:17.875 --> 20:18.750
Like you.

20:18.833 --> 20:22.625
If you prefer, use second-raters.
They'll follow you like sheep.

20:22.708 --> 20:25.708
You don't get it.
The fact he's a genius complicates things.

20:25.791 --> 20:27.958
He's dangerous
because we won't see him coming.

20:28.375 --> 20:29.500
You're my brother.

20:29.583 --> 20:33.166
I would put you in charge
of any heist in a heartbeat.

20:36.291 --> 20:37.166
But him...

20:38.166 --> 20:41.333
You're wrong to trust me and not him.
I'm less trustworthy.

20:44.375 --> 20:45.416
Two beers.

20:52.166 --> 20:53.833
Don't get more peanuts.

20:54.541 --> 20:56.875
You're already
as overweight as an orangutan.

20:58.208 --> 21:01.333
If you laugh at my bow tie,
you're laughing at me.

21:01.666 --> 21:02.791
If you laugh at me,

21:02.875 --> 21:06.291
you'll remember this March 17th
for the rest of your life,

21:06.375 --> 21:08.708
but we don't quite know why yet.

21:10.666 --> 21:12.333
Don't you find it thrilling?

21:24.958 --> 21:26.166
Is something wrong?

21:26.958 --> 21:27.958
Not at all.

21:32.916 --> 21:35.416
There are prints on most of the surfaces.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.791
The walls are covered
with plans, maps, diagrams...

21:43.583 --> 21:44.625
I see an oven.

21:45.125 --> 21:48.166
They probably used it
to get rid of evidence.

21:50.333 --> 21:51.750
I'm going to examine it.

22:01.791 --> 22:05.791
There are some plastic fragments,
perhaps from an electronic device.

22:06.791 --> 22:09.166
I'm separating the burnt pieces.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.500
I think I have something.

22:17.708 --> 22:19.500
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

22:25.500 --> 22:27.041
So I'm a Maserati, am I?

22:27.625 --> 22:31.458
For fuck's sake,
did he put it in the papers too?

22:31.541 --> 22:32.666
It's OK.

22:36.291 --> 22:39.250
-If you want, I'll give you a ride.
-What the hell?

22:39.666 --> 22:41.166
It's just a ride.

22:41.250 --> 22:42.083
"Just a ride"?

22:42.916 --> 22:45.791
Then we push a button, erase the tape,

22:45.875 --> 22:49.958
destroy the black box,
and it's like nothing happened.

23:03.166 --> 23:04.291
Mónica dumped me.

23:04.875 --> 23:06.083
I'm a free man.

23:06.875 --> 23:09.166
I don't need to erase any black box.

23:09.250 --> 23:11.625
I'll take the Maserati,
put the pedal to the metal,

23:11.708 --> 23:14.291
and start doing donuts
until I burn rubber.

23:14.541 --> 23:16.208
Cool as a cucumber.

23:17.125 --> 23:20.375
-You're so macho, aren't you?
-Very macho, so watch out.

23:20.458 --> 23:23.875
In case you have to go to the garage
to change the suspension.

23:24.416 --> 23:26.583
Wait until you see
the state of the chassis.

23:28.541 --> 23:29.541
Scary.

23:45.708 --> 23:48.458
This bastard even leaves misleading clues
in the bidet.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.916
I'm sure they planted it there.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.250
It was at the bottom of the oven, melted.
It's impossible it was planted.

23:56.333 --> 23:57.250
So?

23:57.333 --> 24:00.708
A SIM card is engraved
with a number of up to 19 digits,

24:00.791 --> 24:02.125
unique to each card.

24:02.750 --> 24:06.500
This one disappeared when it was burnt,
but, during the process,

24:06.583 --> 24:08.416
it bent over the metallic chip,

24:08.500 --> 24:10.583
branding seven numbers on it.

24:10.666 --> 24:13.041
We cross-checked it
with data from carriers,

24:13.125 --> 24:17.666
and we came up with 354 cards
matching those end numbers.

24:18.291 --> 24:22.583
One of them was bought three months ago
and has only made one call.

24:23.083 --> 24:24.458
During the heist.

24:24.541 --> 24:25.416
Bingo!

24:25.500 --> 24:26.916
Where did they call?

24:27.000 --> 24:30.083
Wait! A little suspense, no?

24:34.875 --> 24:36.750
Mindanao, the Philippines.

24:36.833 --> 24:38.083
Holy shit, I knew it!

24:40.833 --> 24:42.291
We'll talk to Interpol.

24:53.916 --> 24:56.666
-Hello?
-<i>Mindanao, the Philippines. They know.</i>

25:00.916 --> 25:03.875
-How?
-A half-burnt SIM card. In the ambulance.

25:13.041 --> 25:14.500
Nothing changes for you.

25:14.583 --> 25:17.958
You've got to go into the office now,
show her the watch,

25:18.458 --> 25:22.541
<i>-and tell her: "I'm with you."</i>
<i>-</i>That <i>I</i> am? Should I say it like that?

25:22.958 --> 25:23.833
Excuse me?

25:23.916 --> 25:25.916
"I'm with you" could be confusing.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.458
She might just think I'm weird.
A communist cop.

25:28.541 --> 25:31.958
If I say "The Professor's with you,"
it's clearer.

25:32.041 --> 25:34.666
Just show her the watch. That's all.

25:34.750 --> 25:35.666
Understood.

25:43.291 --> 25:44.708
Get the hostages out.

25:44.958 --> 25:49.166
-Get up and go to the stairs.
-How's the pressure of being in charge?

25:49.250 --> 25:50.833
Fantastic.

25:53.833 --> 25:55.833
I'm all ears. I'm listening.

25:56.916 --> 26:00.375
You have a message from the Professor:
"Lisbon is alive.

26:00.458 --> 26:03.541
She's in the tent.
Think of a way to save her."

26:04.166 --> 26:05.083
It's an order.

26:05.958 --> 26:08.791
First you stage a coup,
now you give me an order.

26:08.875 --> 26:10.541
That's odd. I'd say it's...

26:11.041 --> 26:13.583
a dangerous thing to do, but it's also...

26:13.666 --> 26:15.708
understandable, of course.

26:15.791 --> 26:18.541
There they are, the empowered women.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.166
This is all bullshit.

26:22.625 --> 26:24.583
-And it's about to end.
-Are you done?

26:27.083 --> 26:28.500
What's wrong with you?

26:28.583 --> 26:33.041
-With me?
<i>-</i>Are you angry at your mom?

26:33.916 --> 26:36.375
Didn't she breastfeed you long enough?

26:38.125 --> 26:41.833
Is that why you keep on looking
for something to complain about?

26:47.833 --> 26:52.875
The order comes from the Professor.
He's got a dick, just like you.

27:09.125 --> 27:10.375
They are in Mindanao.

27:12.541 --> 27:14.750
In 24 hours, we'll have found them.

27:14.833 --> 27:16.416
You know the protocol:

27:16.500 --> 27:17.750
Paula arrives here,

27:18.333 --> 27:21.000
you're declared guilty of child abduction,

27:21.083 --> 27:22.416
you lose custody,

27:23.208 --> 27:24.958
and she goes to live with her dad.

27:30.250 --> 27:33.958
Have you come to tell me I'm screwed?
I already know that.

27:40.416 --> 27:41.333
It depends.

27:42.125 --> 27:44.416
I'll let you call them. Here and now.

27:45.500 --> 27:46.625
And you save them.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.708
When we get to the house in Mindanao,
they won't be there.

27:49.791 --> 27:51.083
We screwed up.

27:52.208 --> 27:55.375
I'm not thrilled at the idea
of Paula going to Alberto either.

28:01.041 --> 28:02.625
I wonder what she's doing now.

28:06.666 --> 28:08.375
Close your eyes. Picture her.

28:09.583 --> 28:10.583
Tucked in bed.

28:10.666 --> 28:14.083
Her hair spread across the blanket.
You can almost smell her.

28:15.500 --> 28:18.208
Close your eyes. Picture her.

28:20.500 --> 28:21.416
Close them.

28:21.916 --> 28:23.500
What are you doing?

28:25.791 --> 28:29.625
It's only a five-year wait.
Then you'll see each other again.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.833
She comes running. "Mommy!"

28:32.208 --> 28:34.500
She hugs you like this, wraps you up.

28:34.583 --> 28:37.250
She clings to you like a little monkey.

28:38.416 --> 28:40.375
And you press her against you...

28:41.916 --> 28:43.583
and hold her face.

28:44.416 --> 28:45.625
To look at her.

28:48.500 --> 28:49.875
But she won't let go.

28:50.375 --> 28:51.875
She repeats endlessly,

28:52.250 --> 28:55.125
like a mantra to save her
from the bad things:

28:55.208 --> 28:59.958
"Mommy, don't leave me."

29:00.458 --> 29:01.916
"Mommy, don't leave me."

29:02.500 --> 29:04.500
"Mommy, don't leave me."

29:05.000 --> 29:05.833
Raquel,

29:05.916 --> 29:08.541
I know you love him. And he loves you.

29:08.791 --> 29:13.291
For that exact reason...
what do you think he'd tell you to do?

29:18.583 --> 29:19.833
I offered you...

29:20.958 --> 29:24.083
five years in prison.
I'll change it to five minutes.

29:28.833 --> 29:30.208
I'm offering you freedom.

29:31.666 --> 29:34.291
Sergio goes to jail. You go free.

29:35.083 --> 29:40.791
Your arrest was never official.
Call them, bring them to safety.

29:41.291 --> 29:43.333
You'll be with them in 24 hours.

29:44.541 --> 29:48.333
We'll never come after you.
Everything will be over, honey.

30:38.791 --> 30:39.916
Better?

30:52.083 --> 30:53.000
Well?

30:53.791 --> 30:55.333
Did you get any rest?

30:57.041 --> 30:59.208
I've tried to, but I can't sleep.

31:01.666 --> 31:02.916
Do you have nightmares?

31:03.916 --> 31:06.375
Every time I close my eyes,
I relive it.

31:20.583 --> 31:25.416
Hey, what happened to the alpha male?
I thought you were a free man.

31:26.791 --> 31:28.666
What are they talking about?

31:29.750 --> 31:31.750
Hello, cutie.

31:32.833 --> 31:34.583
Come to my island, if you like.

31:35.750 --> 31:40.333
Provided you don't party much.
I'm not really into that noisy music.

31:43.958 --> 31:46.958
If you invite me over,
I'll show you my best bikini.

31:51.625 --> 31:53.333
Why didn't you tell us?

31:54.750 --> 31:55.666
I couldn't.

31:57.166 --> 31:59.166
You need to talk about it, Rio.

32:02.083 --> 32:04.000
They took me out of my cell one night,

32:05.291 --> 32:07.875
forced me to dig my own grave
in the desert.

32:11.708 --> 32:14.166
I'm such a sweet girl.

32:14.625 --> 32:17.000
That's why I'm smiling all damn day.

32:18.666 --> 32:21.291
Then they made me
place a coffin in the hole.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.791
And they made me get inside.

32:29.708 --> 32:31.541
Then they threw sand on top.

32:34.333 --> 32:35.416
Until I was buried.

32:38.708 --> 32:40.083
And they left me there.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.041
In the darkness.

32:46.166 --> 32:49.458
In silence and barely able to breathe.

32:52.500 --> 32:53.541
Easy.

32:54.958 --> 32:55.833
Easy.

32:58.500 --> 32:59.791
I'm here with you.

33:01.208 --> 33:03.125
Do you know the only thing on my mind?

33:05.416 --> 33:06.250
What?

33:07.375 --> 33:11.916
It should have been the Professor
being buried alive, not me.

33:15.500 --> 33:16.541
I'm sorry.

33:17.625 --> 33:19.041
Look.

33:34.625 --> 33:35.750
Come on, let's go.

33:53.458 --> 33:56.166
Excuse me a second.
I'm going to the bathroom.

34:03.583 --> 34:04.750
You don't trust me.

34:12.916 --> 34:14.333
I'm an egomaniac.

34:16.791 --> 34:19.125
I'll only be willing to follow my plan.

34:20.916 --> 34:22.666
I'm obsessed with being the boss.

34:22.750 --> 34:25.291
So much so that if things don't go
how I planned...

34:27.125 --> 34:29.208
I might become a risk, right?

34:34.833 --> 34:35.666
Yes.

34:36.791 --> 34:38.000
That's what I think.

34:39.833 --> 34:40.958
You figured me out.

34:42.500 --> 34:44.541
But there's something
you haven't considered.

34:45.416 --> 34:50.125
It's that not only do I love your brother,
but I also love the plan...

34:50.375 --> 34:51.875
to the same extent.

34:52.250 --> 34:54.791
I would sell you out, no problem.

34:55.250 --> 34:57.041
And the rest of the gang, too.

34:57.166 --> 34:59.166
But I'd never betray the plan.

35:00.541 --> 35:02.291
That's where my loyalty lies.

35:04.791 --> 35:07.458
This is more than a heist,
and you know it.

35:08.500 --> 35:11.250
The plan isn't perfect yet.
I accept that.

35:11.333 --> 35:12.958
It's an unfinished poem.

35:14.583 --> 35:16.000
We need you, brother.

35:28.458 --> 35:29.458
Please.

35:46.500 --> 35:48.750
You seemed very brave out there.

35:50.958 --> 35:52.250
Which is admirable.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.208
Commendable.

36:09.500 --> 36:10.750
Come on, let me past.

36:16.083 --> 36:19.750
You seemed very brave earlier,
but now you have to prove it.

36:28.416 --> 36:30.041
Let's see those balls.

36:33.291 --> 36:34.250
Hold on.

36:37.416 --> 36:39.750
Hold on. Tell me what you prefer?

36:41.291 --> 36:42.125
Death?

36:42.875 --> 36:47.333
Look at me. Or impotence?
Sometimes you have to make hard choices.

36:47.416 --> 36:50.833
For me: what do I do
with this jerk laughing at my bow tie?

36:50.916 --> 36:54.375
For you: is it worth living
without a penis?

37:01.875 --> 37:03.291
He's taking a long time.

37:03.375 --> 37:06.208
He's beating up the fat guy
in the bathroom.

37:07.208 --> 37:09.083
We would've heard something.

37:10.875 --> 37:13.083
Real chaos, dear Sergio...

37:14.583 --> 37:15.791
makes no noise.

37:19.708 --> 37:21.666
<i>Palermo was loyal to the heist.</i>

37:21.750 --> 37:24.541
<i>But in his head,</i>
<i>that only meant one thing:</i>

37:25.375 --> 37:28.833
<i>for the heist to continue,</i>
<i>he had to be back in charge.</i>

37:29.500 --> 37:33.041
<i>It was his silent way of ensuring</i>
<i>we didn't see the chaos coming.</i>

37:33.333 --> 37:36.208
You know what you have to do.
Don't be a coward.

37:37.166 --> 37:39.333
You have to dislocate the joint

37:40.000 --> 37:42.958
between the first metacarpal
and the trapezium.

37:43.041 --> 37:45.041
Firmly, without hesitation.

37:45.833 --> 37:50.208
You twist it around like that.
There's no shackle it won't work on.

37:51.083 --> 37:53.041
Don't make me have to separate you.

38:00.416 --> 38:04.708
It'll hurt. But freedom will be worth it,
don't you think?

38:08.416 --> 38:09.291
Come on.

38:42.500 --> 38:43.375
Don't move!

38:49.750 --> 38:51.125
-Don't move.
-Easy, kid.

38:51.958 --> 38:54.000
I'm just a fucking security guard.

38:54.958 --> 38:55.916
On the ground.

38:57.666 --> 38:59.916
-No way.
-I said, on the ground now.

39:00.541 --> 39:03.125
What are you going to do?
Shoot me, unarmed?

39:04.958 --> 39:07.291
I swear if I have to, I will shoot you.

39:07.583 --> 39:11.583
You'll shoot an unarmed father
who is only trying to escape?

39:14.375 --> 39:15.333
Go ahead.

39:21.333 --> 39:22.500
Here I am.

39:22.791 --> 39:25.000
Don't move!

39:27.208 --> 39:29.500
Get on the fucking ground, Gandía!

39:30.791 --> 39:31.916
You won't shoot.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.458
On the ground!

39:35.375 --> 39:37.375
Don't move, for fuck's sake!

39:38.041 --> 39:39.250
I said, don't move!

39:45.958 --> 39:47.208
See you soon.
