WEBVTT

00:05.137 --> 00:07.773
A few months ago
I started getting these letters.

00:09.657 --> 00:11.030
Who wrote you the letters?

00:11.089 --> 00:12.398
If I'm to be harmed,

00:12.485 --> 00:14.888
I need you to reach out
to the other Howard.

00:16.687 --> 00:19.223
Are we still together over here?

00:19.323 --> 00:21.292
Are we happy?

00:21.392 --> 00:24.169
A woman from our world
was arrested... an assassin.

00:24.228 --> 00:26.405
- They call her Baldwin.
- She's here illegally,

00:26.430 --> 00:27.734
and I need to find out who sent her.

00:27.759 --> 00:30.556
- Not my concern.
- Lambert, the ambassador...

00:30.734 --> 00:32.430
Think he might be working
with these people.

00:32.493 --> 00:33.908
Aldrich, they'll kill us all.

00:35.441 --> 00:36.651
Leave them.

00:36.767 --> 00:38.094
You didn't give them anything, did you?

00:38.194 --> 00:39.879
Your side is compromised.

00:39.909 --> 00:41.445
I'm not saying it's your department,

00:41.470 --> 00:42.887
but I'm sure as hell not
saying it's not.

00:42.912 --> 00:43.956
We're fucked.

00:43.981 --> 00:45.843
Not if we send this
one back in my place.

00:45.868 --> 00:47.387
We're after the same people.

00:47.414 --> 00:48.861
They tried to take me out.

00:48.886 --> 00:50.454
They might try the same with you.

01:05.595 --> 01:07.330
Oh, my God.

01:10.873 --> 01:11.941
Danke.

01:12.075 --> 01:13.676
Gute Nacht.

04:18.320 --> 04:22.324
I get to work every morning at 8:30.

04:22.349 --> 04:23.835
I'm never late.

04:23.860 --> 04:25.935
- Howard.
- Early, actually,

04:25.966 --> 04:29.449
so... I guess I get to work
at 8:20-something.

04:29.525 --> 04:31.404
Howard.

04:31.567 --> 04:34.437
What are you doing in there?
Packing? Are you packing?

04:34.490 --> 04:38.127
- You said it might be a week.
- You're gonna be living in my life.

04:38.287 --> 04:40.109
You don't need...

04:40.949 --> 04:42.490
Forget it.

04:43.820 --> 04:46.469
Um... after work,

04:46.549 --> 04:48.698
I, uh, I just grab a quick dinner,

04:48.723 --> 04:52.994
and I get to the hospital
between 7:00 and 7:30.

04:54.068 --> 04:56.759
I read to her, but you know that.

04:56.859 --> 04:58.187
Anything else?

04:58.234 --> 04:59.341
Uh, most mornings

04:59.375 --> 05:02.744
I-I stop for coffee down at the cafÃ©.

05:03.038 --> 05:05.341
Uh, Go. Uh, we play

05:05.414 --> 05:06.961
the board game Go.

05:06.986 --> 05:08.921
On Tuesdays and Thursdays,
I meet a friend.

05:08.959 --> 05:13.563
His name is Andrei,
and, uh, we play Go.

05:14.456 --> 05:15.975
Jesus.

05:20.483 --> 05:23.044
You know, they say it's so great

05:23.099 --> 05:26.235
to meet yourself.

05:26.489 --> 05:28.116
Bullshit.

05:29.091 --> 05:31.227
Kind of like losing
your virginity, you know?

05:32.019 --> 05:33.288
Wait your whole life for it,

05:33.313 --> 05:35.849
and then 20 seconds later,
you're disappointed.

05:36.099 --> 05:37.421
What are you doing?

05:38.241 --> 05:40.503
In about six hours,

05:40.549 --> 05:42.751
we need to become each other.

05:43.105 --> 05:45.262
Even though, apparently,
I can pretty much do

05:45.287 --> 05:47.561
whatever the fuck I want,
as long as it's not too exciting

05:47.586 --> 05:49.528
or even remotely interesting.

05:50.334 --> 05:52.348
If we really want to get
to know each other,

05:53.116 --> 05:54.584
let's play cards.

06:03.579 --> 06:05.862
So, how'd you meet this Andrei?

06:08.464 --> 06:11.157
Uh, we met at the hospital.

06:11.794 --> 06:14.096
His sister was admitted
the same day as Emily.

06:15.177 --> 06:17.512
She's diabetic.

06:19.609 --> 06:23.935
Any, uh... extracurriculars?

06:24.066 --> 06:25.919
You mean...

06:26.062 --> 06:29.414
Jesus, Howard. Are there
any other women in your life?

06:30.205 --> 06:32.141
I'm married.

06:34.476 --> 06:37.393
Did-did you...

06:37.800 --> 06:40.659
When she was still alive,

06:40.930 --> 06:44.134
did you do that kind of thing?

06:47.451 --> 06:49.353
So, let me get this straight.

06:49.599 --> 06:52.404
Your only friend in this
big old city is some guy

06:52.429 --> 06:55.266
you didn't even know
until six weeks ago?

06:55.712 --> 06:58.447
Until six weeks ago, I had her.

07:01.245 --> 07:03.293
What about, uh...

07:03.693 --> 07:05.462
what about your routines?

07:06.255 --> 07:08.164
Don't worry about me.

07:08.658 --> 07:09.834
I work a desk job

07:09.859 --> 07:11.990
and have absolutely no social life.

07:12.041 --> 07:15.040
We've spent the last hour
going over my stuff,

07:15.065 --> 07:18.102
and you do I-I don't know what,

07:18.735 --> 07:20.603
and your answer is,
"Don't worry about it"?

07:20.681 --> 07:21.871
Yeah. I got a guy.

07:21.896 --> 07:24.104
His name is Raash.
He'll take care of you.

07:24.227 --> 07:26.891
You do realize we're the same
person, right? Essentially.

07:26.916 --> 07:29.738
I mean, the same flesh
and blood, the same DNA.

07:29.872 --> 07:31.684
Yeah. Believe me, I do.

07:31.789 --> 07:35.194
Then why do you feel compelled
to treat me so badly?

07:37.486 --> 07:39.287
It's your bet.

07:47.215 --> 07:49.117
You flopped top pair,
and you're folding?

07:49.398 --> 07:51.868
That was a good bluff.

07:52.168 --> 07:53.551
Do me a favor, will you?

07:53.576 --> 07:56.670
Play one hand like you actually
know how to win.

08:06.208 --> 08:08.444
Howard, play the fucking hand.

08:13.555 --> 08:15.658
Are we finished?

08:30.507 --> 08:33.075
No one will notice you here.

08:33.508 --> 08:35.878
Fresh clothes.

08:45.067 --> 08:46.735
Weapon?

08:48.905 --> 08:51.508
You were in their custody for hours.

08:52.055 --> 08:54.057
What did they ask you?

09:09.490 --> 09:11.359
I'm sorry.

09:11.809 --> 09:14.218
About what happened to your other.

09:15.043 --> 09:16.978
She's dead.

09:17.954 --> 09:19.822
And I gave them nothing.

09:40.203 --> 09:43.572
I'll talk to them about
next steps. Get some rest.

10:06.368 --> 10:08.170
Howard, it's time.

10:14.103 --> 10:15.972
Well, well, well.

10:16.145 --> 10:17.852
You're saving the good stuff, huh?

10:17.947 --> 10:21.784
That's not for me. Or you.

10:23.117 --> 10:25.665
It's for when she wakes up.

10:33.743 --> 10:35.536
Just one week.

10:36.966 --> 10:38.935
You're doing the right thing.

10:39.309 --> 10:40.862
They're gonna see through me.

10:40.983 --> 10:42.752
Not if you keep your mouth shut.

10:44.048 --> 10:47.143
You'll read to her every day.

10:47.356 --> 10:49.127
I will.

10:56.297 --> 10:57.889
Keep her safe.

10:59.622 --> 11:01.272
Find these people.

11:03.578 --> 11:05.016
Howard.

11:42.524 --> 11:44.139
I'll take him, Cyrus, from here.

11:44.206 --> 11:45.408
Thank you.

11:58.074 --> 11:59.375
Do you have his paperwork?

11:59.428 --> 12:00.685
Yeah.

12:00.743 --> 12:03.546
All right. They don't do that,
by the way.

12:04.153 --> 12:05.277
What?

12:05.342 --> 12:08.445
Shake hands. Berlin,
on the other side, they...

12:08.585 --> 12:11.009
You'll see. It's a germ thing.

12:11.153 --> 12:12.479
Good to know.

12:12.661 --> 12:14.630
Howard, if you are caught,

12:15.241 --> 12:17.354
there's no one
to protect you over there.

12:17.407 --> 12:19.776
You understand? You're on your own.

12:21.482 --> 12:22.601
Yeah.

12:22.637 --> 12:25.139
I have to deny any part of this.

12:27.421 --> 12:29.490
Okay. Thank you.

12:35.744 --> 12:36.839
Danke.

14:55.504 --> 14:57.640
Arms up.

15:02.037 --> 15:03.192
Yours?

15:03.217 --> 15:04.981
Oh, shit, I forgot.

15:05.595 --> 15:08.865
Oh, come on, it's just
a pack of bloody smokes.

15:09.577 --> 15:11.786
Oh, for God's sake,
it was just a mistake.

15:11.874 --> 15:13.642
Come on, really?

15:13.910 --> 15:15.722
Sir?

15:19.848 --> 15:21.350
Purpose of visit?

15:21.483 --> 15:23.585
Uh, the, uh, embassy pouch.

15:48.768 --> 15:50.970
Welcome home.

15:59.715 --> 16:01.470
I'm Raash.

17:05.928 --> 17:07.863
Thank you.

17:13.462 --> 17:15.729
Hey! Hey! What...

17:15.810 --> 17:16.837
Come on,

17:16.862 --> 17:17.921
what are you...?

17:17.945 --> 17:19.097
Hey.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.420
Hey!

17:40.989 --> 17:42.992
A little sparse.

17:44.315 --> 17:46.741
I have a few contacts
left at the embassy.

17:46.914 --> 17:49.145
We'll put more escorts on Lambert.

17:49.304 --> 17:53.008
If he has any connections to
Baldwin, my men will find out.

18:02.178 --> 18:05.081
Do you ever have doubts
about these men?

18:06.113 --> 18:07.473
I'm just wondering
how we've always been

18:07.497 --> 18:09.465
one step behind here.

18:10.452 --> 18:12.615
'Cause we've been meticulous, right?

18:13.128 --> 18:15.210
In our vetting. I mean, there's no...

18:15.651 --> 18:19.088
There's no chance of any point
of compromise here, is there?

18:20.082 --> 18:21.910
Not unless you count Howard Silk.

18:22.078 --> 18:23.970
You promoted him.

18:25.067 --> 18:26.740
Well, that was the deal.

18:26.781 --> 18:28.216
His other's gone.

18:29.157 --> 18:31.409
- Why make deals?
- Because, candidly speaking,

18:31.434 --> 18:33.431
that man's been a lot more
useful than your lot lately,

18:33.456 --> 18:35.311
and I'd like to stay on his good side.

18:37.719 --> 18:39.854
Was there anything else?

18:59.614 --> 19:01.950
Ah, finally, they send help.

19:06.768 --> 19:08.804
Thought I was gonna be in Strategy.

19:09.044 --> 19:10.982
Yes, this is it. Strategy payroll.

19:11.007 --> 19:12.824
You have a degree in accounting, yeah?

19:12.947 --> 19:14.408
No.

19:14.616 --> 19:15.851
Your desk.

19:16.645 --> 19:18.137
They think what I do is a joke,

19:18.162 --> 19:20.152
so now they play a joke on me.

19:21.510 --> 19:24.762
Need to file every time card,
mark it with code, send it back.

19:24.787 --> 19:28.157
You take too long, I will
find someone to replace you.

19:28.290 --> 19:30.192
Questions?

19:32.154 --> 19:33.446
Uh, where are you going?

19:33.516 --> 19:35.384
Personal day.

19:56.732 --> 19:58.250
What is wrong with you?

19:58.627 --> 20:00.699
This is all his idea, I assume?

20:00.855 --> 20:02.624
Groceries.

20:05.579 --> 20:08.800
So, this is it?

20:08.825 --> 20:12.714
Just you and me, locked
in this apartment for a week?

20:14.657 --> 20:16.693
God, I'm such an idiot.

20:18.280 --> 20:20.065
Open the door.

20:21.636 --> 20:23.049
I just saw Raash go in there.

20:23.074 --> 20:24.942
I know you're in there.

20:26.707 --> 20:28.124
Dad!

20:36.157 --> 20:37.430
Your phone's been off all day.

20:37.455 --> 20:39.777
Mom's in the hospital,
we've got to go, come on.

20:40.075 --> 20:42.114
- Mom?
- Yes.

20:44.626 --> 20:45.749
Your mom?

20:45.774 --> 20:47.824
Obviously. What... get your jacket.

20:47.870 --> 20:51.206
Come on. Come on.

21:18.981 --> 21:20.776
Anna?

21:22.021 --> 21:23.289
What?

21:24.346 --> 21:28.278
What, uh... what happened
to your mother?

21:28.550 --> 21:30.558
It was another overdose.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.806
Yeah. Neighbors found her on the floor.

21:32.831 --> 21:34.066
Barely had a pulse.

21:34.509 --> 21:37.144
She'd probably been there all night.

21:39.168 --> 21:41.503
You're actually surprised?

21:44.246 --> 21:48.117
I-I'm a lot of things right now.

21:48.833 --> 21:50.873
Yeah, well, don't worry.
You don't have to do anything.

21:50.898 --> 21:53.533
I'll deal with the doctors
when we get there.

21:53.973 --> 21:55.330
Right.

21:55.917 --> 21:59.055
Yeah. O-Of course.

22:12.613 --> 22:13.915
I see you.

22:19.890 --> 22:21.765
Mm-hmm.

22:26.974 --> 22:28.776
Two escorts now.

22:29.310 --> 22:31.341
For some reason, they think
I'm using these appointments

22:31.366 --> 22:33.434
for clandestine meetings.

22:35.637 --> 22:38.606
So, where is she?

22:39.207 --> 22:40.837
She wants to keep working.

22:41.008 --> 22:42.710
Says she told them nothing.

22:42.923 --> 22:46.026
Told you she told them nothing.

22:50.686 --> 22:53.421
Have you heard anything from home?

22:57.058 --> 22:59.227
Towel, please.

23:05.747 --> 23:07.242
Your friends are not happy

23:07.267 --> 23:09.643
with how things have been developing.

23:11.299 --> 23:14.639
They want to bring over our
guests earlier than expected.

23:14.763 --> 23:16.599
She hasn't removed the targets yet.

23:16.764 --> 23:18.625
And on that note,

23:18.774 --> 23:22.122
they also raised questions

23:22.277 --> 23:24.347
about your assassin friend.

23:25.179 --> 23:26.931
First they push me out of an airplane

23:26.956 --> 23:29.125
and then they take away my chute.

23:29.976 --> 23:31.410
They want her removed.

23:31.435 --> 23:33.171
She trusts me.

23:33.235 --> 23:36.038
That's putting it lightly,
from what I hear.

23:36.712 --> 23:38.308
Perhaps it's time

23:38.340 --> 23:41.476
you actually use that situation
to your advantage.

23:43.065 --> 23:44.813
Clare.

23:51.540 --> 23:53.769
I can't imagine
the pressure you're under.

23:54.282 --> 23:57.018
The weight of these expectations.

23:57.244 --> 24:00.647
But after all the work
that they did to place you here,

24:01.329 --> 24:03.461
would you really risk this mission

24:03.754 --> 24:05.918
when we're so close to the big day?

24:06.101 --> 24:07.935
I'll take care of it.

24:08.676 --> 24:10.779
You always do.

25:07.629 --> 25:09.297
How are you feeling?

25:10.044 --> 25:12.056
Thirsty.

25:19.628 --> 25:21.265
Jesus, Em.

25:22.284 --> 25:24.248
What happened?

25:25.614 --> 25:27.316
Um...

25:27.563 --> 25:29.665
There some reason you're here, Howard?

25:30.680 --> 25:32.146
I'm...

25:32.640 --> 25:34.041
Well, thank you for coming.

25:34.128 --> 25:36.318
- I've got it.
- Could you...

25:36.685 --> 25:38.982
put your dicks away, please?

25:49.731 --> 25:51.633
"Light a candle at St. Christopher's."

25:52.146 --> 25:54.655
What the fuck does that even mean?

25:56.818 --> 25:59.756
You want to know what I'm
thinking right now, you prick?

26:00.175 --> 26:02.244
I'm thinking this is on you.

26:03.631 --> 26:06.138
Stay the fuck away from her.

26:32.407 --> 26:34.743
Really? Just walk out
in the middle of the day?

26:34.803 --> 26:36.538
You want to be any more conspicuous?

26:36.732 --> 26:38.194
That was your idea of a promotion?

26:38.219 --> 26:39.536
- Payroll?
- Well, I'm sorry.

26:39.561 --> 26:42.053
It was the best I could do
with ten seconds' notice.

26:43.578 --> 26:46.648
Okay, what do you know
about this, uh, Lambert?

26:47.142 --> 26:49.044
Nothing.

26:50.225 --> 26:51.657
I don't know, we got men
on him all the time,

26:51.682 --> 26:53.728
but he's a high-ranking diplomat, so...

26:55.223 --> 26:56.358
Huh.

26:57.392 --> 26:59.827
- Really?
- What?

27:00.268 --> 27:03.236
You're married to
a director's daughter, right?

27:03.458 --> 27:04.925
Yeah. So?

27:05.900 --> 27:08.024
What the hell's my marriage got to...?

27:08.316 --> 27:10.971
I'll have you know I was
on my own career trajectory

27:10.996 --> 27:13.131
long before I met
Roland Fancher's daughter.

27:13.495 --> 27:16.197
- Okay.
- Yeah, and I resent the implication.

27:16.478 --> 27:18.132
I'm fucking good at my job,

27:18.193 --> 27:20.307
and when it comes
to my work, Howard Silk,

27:20.362 --> 27:22.196
nothing gets past me.

27:22.464 --> 27:25.712
So I guess you know all about
other Howard's wife, then, huh?

27:26.571 --> 27:28.382
She was an agent.

27:28.682 --> 27:31.246
Housekeeping? Under Aldrich.

27:31.803 --> 27:33.152
How do you know that?

27:33.241 --> 27:35.309
'Cause she was my contact.

27:35.616 --> 27:37.197
She reached out to me months ago,

27:37.222 --> 27:39.757
said things on your floor
were compromised,

27:39.934 --> 27:42.000
she couldn't trust anybody,

27:42.211 --> 27:44.067
and then she had a little accident.

27:45.412 --> 27:46.816
But you know all about that, right?

27:46.841 --> 27:48.522
'Cause nothing gets past you.

27:49.756 --> 27:51.546
Get back to the fucking Office.

27:51.640 --> 27:53.476
I'm meeting a friend this afternoon.

27:53.501 --> 27:54.602
Who?

27:55.203 --> 27:57.073
An old friend. Don't worry about it.

27:57.098 --> 27:58.458
All right, we're gonna
have to establish

27:58.482 --> 28:01.001
a few fucking ground rules here.

28:01.350 --> 28:03.133
Both of our lives are on the line

28:03.158 --> 28:04.260
because of this arrangement,

28:04.285 --> 28:05.467
so you can't wander around my world

28:05.492 --> 28:07.261
like it's your fucking playground.

28:07.622 --> 28:09.724
We're in lockstep from now on.

28:10.237 --> 28:13.327
So who is this friend,
and when are we meeting him?

28:15.043 --> 28:16.345
What do you remember?

28:16.370 --> 28:19.273
- Couple of pairs of feet.
- Faces?

28:19.721 --> 28:23.235
Ian, I promise you I'll talk
to you about it, but not here.

28:23.365 --> 28:24.466
It's not safe.

28:26.708 --> 28:29.170
Well, let me tell you how this
looks from an Office perspective.

28:29.195 --> 28:31.027
Oh, here we go.

28:31.616 --> 28:33.736
You failed another drug test.

28:33.956 --> 28:36.237
You know that's not what this is.

28:36.398 --> 28:37.912
In light of this,

28:38.139 --> 28:40.265
Dwyer's requested a full evaluation.

28:40.462 --> 28:43.075
See if you're fit to return.

28:44.466 --> 28:46.225
He wants you supervised,

28:46.361 --> 28:48.763
followed, monitored.

28:50.437 --> 28:53.612
He could have burned you
entirely, but I spoke to him,

28:53.909 --> 28:55.744
bought you some time.

28:55.864 --> 28:57.664
Talk to me, Em.

28:59.977 --> 29:01.667
What's going on?

29:01.796 --> 29:04.471
I can't talk about it now.

29:09.396 --> 29:11.125
We'll fight it.

29:13.522 --> 29:16.125
Pills again, dash of cocaine.

29:16.956 --> 29:19.854
And just last week, I said to myself,

29:20.171 --> 29:21.822
"She's better now.

29:21.923 --> 29:23.890
You don't have to worry."

29:24.545 --> 29:25.863
I'm sorry.

29:26.027 --> 29:28.696
- For what?
- For...

29:29.122 --> 29:30.857
not being there.

29:31.632 --> 29:32.925
No, you're not.

29:32.974 --> 29:35.153
And fuck you, by the way.

29:37.972 --> 29:39.674
Do you know what? You don't
have to be here anymore.

29:39.699 --> 29:41.800
I thought I needed
your help, but I don't.

29:42.309 --> 29:43.678
I want to be here.

29:43.792 --> 29:47.134
Because you feel guilty. Otherwise,

29:47.159 --> 29:49.489
you would have buggered off
at the first sight of me.

29:49.984 --> 29:52.072
I'll go if it makes you feel
more comfortable.

29:52.097 --> 29:54.312
- Of course.
- But I-I would like to stay.

29:54.337 --> 29:56.840
Then stay. Jesus, Dad,
what's the matter with you?

30:00.595 --> 30:02.063
We'll get her help.

30:02.290 --> 30:04.278
Good luck trying to convince her.

30:05.186 --> 30:07.088
We'll do it together.

30:09.276 --> 30:10.679
So, who is this friend?

30:10.725 --> 30:12.369
He's originally from my side,

30:12.394 --> 30:14.463
but he now has an identity here.

30:14.723 --> 30:16.286
But you didn't hear that.

30:20.082 --> 30:22.017
Heinrich is here?

30:32.033 --> 30:33.291
Holy shit.

30:33.316 --> 30:35.411
You're here.

30:35.538 --> 30:36.899
Indeed I am.

30:36.997 --> 30:38.490
Hello.

30:40.815 --> 30:42.533
Good to see you, pal.

30:42.611 --> 30:44.279
Come here.

30:50.478 --> 30:52.070
Local?

30:52.894 --> 30:55.630
Yeah, do you mind giving us
a few minutes?

31:01.596 --> 31:03.598
Here, sit.

31:05.234 --> 31:08.102
Brought a little something for you.

31:08.923 --> 31:10.785
Compliments of the other side.

31:21.648 --> 31:23.417
It's good to see you.

31:23.517 --> 31:24.919
I miss this shit.

31:25.514 --> 31:27.421
It's terrible over here.

31:27.754 --> 31:29.244
Nothing like home.

31:29.623 --> 31:30.857
Here's to home.

31:30.956 --> 31:32.057
Cheers.

31:37.382 --> 31:39.265
So, how you doing over here? Okay?

31:39.290 --> 31:40.991
Well, cover is decent.

31:41.266 --> 31:43.948
Um, married a local...

31:45.763 --> 31:48.166
who actually loves me.

31:49.133 --> 31:50.842
You?

31:52.292 --> 31:55.406
I think I'm having a problem
with our old friend.

31:58.044 --> 32:00.978
You know anything about this
group Pope is working with?

32:01.205 --> 32:03.481
Brought an assassin over here.

32:03.751 --> 32:07.352
Lambert at the embassy's
apparently a part of it, too.

32:08.430 --> 32:10.621
Are you sure you want
to know about this?

32:12.022 --> 32:13.862
They're fucked up, these people.

32:14.315 --> 32:16.927
Fanatics inside our office.

32:17.592 --> 32:19.664
And Pope is definitely involved?

32:20.113 --> 32:21.406
Yeah.

32:21.511 --> 32:24.514
He's been helping 'em move
illegals a long time now.

32:26.882 --> 32:28.274
Hey.

32:29.743 --> 32:31.509
He is what he is.

32:31.609 --> 32:33.165
Yeah, yeah, don't...

32:33.237 --> 32:35.052
I don't need the whole fucking speech.

32:37.754 --> 32:39.522
How long ago did he pitch you?

32:39.954 --> 32:41.452
Almost 20 years.

32:42.457 --> 32:44.088
We helped build this network

32:44.188 --> 32:45.407
and you're actually surprised

32:45.432 --> 32:47.867
it's being used for this kind of shit?

32:51.928 --> 32:53.529
- Thanks, schatz.
- Mm-hmm.

32:53.750 --> 32:55.151
Danke schon.

32:57.533 --> 32:59.569
Five minutes till lunch.

33:05.528 --> 33:07.272
Don't fight him.

33:08.105 --> 33:10.620
Whatever angle you think
you have, he's got it covered.

33:11.307 --> 33:14.318
I'm a step ahead of him
for the time being, anyway.

33:15.345 --> 33:17.225
Sure about that?

33:18.432 --> 33:20.791
Listen, there's something
you should know.

33:22.860 --> 33:25.414
There's a source
on the Third Floor over here.

33:25.582 --> 33:28.318
A mole, very high clearance.

33:28.685 --> 33:31.220
They say he's been feeding Pope
for years now.

33:33.303 --> 33:34.968
Strategy.

33:36.366 --> 33:38.901
High clearance as in director level?

33:39.753 --> 33:41.216
Mm-hmm.

33:41.351 --> 33:43.019
You don't have a name?

33:43.119 --> 33:44.843
Something's about to happen.

33:45.008 --> 33:47.744
People coming over. Something big.

33:49.138 --> 33:51.889
You go up against
Alexander Pope, you'll lose.

34:24.065 --> 34:26.835
- Danke schÃ¶n.
- Bitte schÃ¶n.

34:53.069 --> 34:54.971
Sorry about the mess.

35:01.826 --> 35:03.160
Can I get you anything?

35:03.562 --> 35:05.062
No, thank you.

35:05.341 --> 35:07.343
Make yourself at home.

35:40.330 --> 35:43.200
Just a word on tradecraft.

35:44.420 --> 35:45.930
My ex-husband

35:46.023 --> 35:47.972
wouldn't have brought me home,

35:48.218 --> 35:49.687
wouldn't even have come
to the hospital,

35:49.712 --> 35:52.637
and certainly wouldn't have
lent me his coat.

35:54.467 --> 35:56.814
Perhaps it'll be simpler
if we introduce ourselves.

35:56.914 --> 35:58.783
I'm Emily.

36:07.925 --> 36:10.600
I... I-I don't know what you...

36:10.625 --> 36:12.060
Well, let me guess.

36:12.342 --> 36:13.877
You two were colluding.

36:14.123 --> 36:15.591
He's had you brought over here

36:15.616 --> 36:18.553
so that he can spend
more time over there.

36:19.375 --> 36:22.799
I'm... I'm-I'm not...
colluding with him.

36:24.100 --> 36:26.069
That's not how it looks, Howard.

36:26.256 --> 36:28.428
He had me brought over here

36:28.471 --> 36:31.841
and kept my locked
in an empty apartment.

36:32.478 --> 36:34.578
And what's he doing next?

36:34.831 --> 36:36.455
He's, um...

36:38.735 --> 36:40.471
...he's investigating something.

36:40.631 --> 36:42.153
I-I don't know.

36:42.245 --> 36:43.988
You don't know or you won't tell me?

36:44.060 --> 36:46.730
Believe me, he did not
keep me in the loop.

36:47.203 --> 36:49.707
I mean, he told me you were dead.

36:52.252 --> 36:54.138
So, what department do you work for?

36:54.545 --> 36:58.182
Up until just a few days ago,
I was in Interface.

36:58.255 --> 36:59.797
Interface?

37:00.463 --> 37:02.999
- No, he hasn't worked for them since...
- No, I-I know.

37:03.245 --> 37:05.515
He hasn't, but, uh...

37:05.973 --> 37:07.251
I was still there.

37:10.898 --> 37:13.523
Perhaps it's best if we don't
talk about everything.

37:13.858 --> 37:14.926
Yes.

37:15.253 --> 37:17.250
Best for everyone.

37:23.650 --> 37:25.302
Why are you looking at me like that?

37:25.768 --> 37:27.403
I'm sorry.

37:28.699 --> 37:29.833
You shouldn't be here.

37:29.858 --> 37:31.460
This isn't usual behavior for him.

37:31.485 --> 37:32.932
It'll attract attention.

37:35.513 --> 37:36.853
Oh, I forgot.

37:36.878 --> 37:40.214
I, uh, invited Anna for dinner.

37:40.256 --> 37:42.032
Is that unusual, too?

37:42.057 --> 37:43.422
Yes.

37:53.276 --> 37:54.888
Hi, Mom.

37:57.397 --> 37:59.064
Dad.

38:09.245 --> 38:10.680
Did you sleep?

38:12.808 --> 38:14.517
What did they say?

38:15.164 --> 38:17.385
They're worried about the situation.

38:18.494 --> 38:20.363
But they're glad you're all right.

38:20.743 --> 38:22.678
They want you to kill me.

38:24.862 --> 38:26.677
We have to find a new crash pad.

38:26.702 --> 38:28.638
It won't be safe for you here.

38:30.361 --> 38:31.624
Three more contracts.

38:31.649 --> 38:33.617
- Nadia.
- I can finish the kill list.

38:33.642 --> 38:35.111
You don't know these people like I do.

38:35.136 --> 38:36.453
They don't tolerate mistakes.

38:36.478 --> 38:38.214
Why are you protecting me?

38:39.301 --> 38:41.127
Because I care about you.

38:43.085 --> 38:45.187
You only care about your mission.

38:46.597 --> 38:48.734
Is that who you think I am?

38:48.958 --> 38:51.394
You think I just drop you
on the side of the road?

38:52.370 --> 38:54.759
You're not the only one, you know.

38:56.320 --> 38:59.429
When I first crossed over,
I watched my other

39:00.495 --> 39:02.366
and her quaint, little life.

39:03.818 --> 39:05.739
She had everything.

39:06.195 --> 39:09.927
She was free and happy.

39:11.501 --> 39:13.443
And I was alone.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.370
Why are you telling me this?

39:16.554 --> 39:18.092
Because it's a choice.

39:18.774 --> 39:20.509
Loneliness.

39:22.299 --> 39:24.128
Let me help you.

39:24.748 --> 39:27.017
You're the only one
who knows who I really am

39:27.424 --> 39:29.386
in this whole fucking world,

39:29.773 --> 39:32.965
and I would never let anyone hurt you.

39:39.982 --> 39:41.491
I'm sorry.

39:44.108 --> 39:45.642
No.

41:38.887 --> 41:40.422
Anna.

41:41.750 --> 41:43.619
Dinner is served.

41:50.700 --> 41:53.370
Didn't know you could do
anything but barbecue.

41:55.868 --> 41:57.997
Well, I guess, uh...

41:58.608 --> 42:01.211
you learn things living alone.

42:03.679 --> 42:05.205
Wow.

42:05.861 --> 42:07.334
It's actually really good.

42:08.499 --> 42:10.867
You always mess up a compliment
with "actually."

42:14.177 --> 42:15.979
When did you learn to cook?

42:16.404 --> 42:19.629
A cooking class a while back.

42:19.729 --> 42:22.853
The secret of the chicken is
to leave it in the oven

42:22.887 --> 42:27.688
as it cools, and it helps
to bring out the flavor.

42:28.667 --> 42:32.037
It's wonderful, actually.

42:34.157 --> 42:35.670
Always was your favorite.

42:43.758 --> 42:45.645
Anna, how's work?

42:46.256 --> 42:48.392
Anything but the subject at hand.

42:49.539 --> 42:52.776
I thought we could wait until dessert.

42:53.095 --> 42:54.329
What's going on here?

42:55.428 --> 42:57.698
- Going on?
- Are yo...

42:57.908 --> 42:59.068
Are you two getting back together?

42:59.093 --> 43:00.444
- No.
- What?

43:00.529 --> 43:02.563
Then stop acting like teenagers.

43:02.658 --> 43:04.961
Okay, let's settle down.

43:05.041 --> 43:06.986
For a second, I thought you gave a shit

43:07.011 --> 43:08.479
about something other than yourself.

43:08.851 --> 43:11.994
- Anna...
- Mom overdosed again!

43:12.174 --> 43:14.510
And I'm the only one who seems to care.

43:17.596 --> 43:19.230
Anna, please sit down. Please.

43:19.282 --> 43:21.671
I'm so sick of being your mother.

43:22.784 --> 43:25.428
I'm sick of being the parent
to both of you.

45:55.979 --> 45:58.682
That wasn't your fault, you know.

46:00.643 --> 46:02.704
You were no part of that.

46:05.021 --> 46:06.223
I know.

46:08.178 --> 46:09.596
For a moment, it felt like I was,

46:09.621 --> 46:11.857
but... I know.

46:14.431 --> 46:16.414
Is she like that on your side?

46:19.035 --> 46:20.637
Uh...

46:21.718 --> 46:24.020
When, uh... when my Emily got pregnant,

46:24.127 --> 46:28.399
we went overboard with
the clothes and the room

46:28.473 --> 46:30.694
and the registry.

46:31.114 --> 46:33.316
We wanted everything to be perfect.

46:35.698 --> 46:38.263
I used to lean into her belly

46:38.288 --> 46:40.384
and... talk to the baby,

46:40.409 --> 46:42.857
tell her what the world was like.

46:44.106 --> 46:47.209
Seemed like when I did that,
she would kick.

46:50.220 --> 46:52.672
But, uh, she miscarried.

46:56.426 --> 46:58.120
I'm so sorry.

47:01.216 --> 47:03.613
We had already picked out the name.

47:05.701 --> 47:07.468
Anna.

47:11.901 --> 47:14.681
Look, I don't... I don't...
I don't really know

47:14.964 --> 47:16.766
how it is between you and him.

47:16.791 --> 47:20.562
I mean... I could guess,

47:20.910 --> 47:23.294
knowing him a bit.

47:24.133 --> 47:26.160
But, um...

47:28.332 --> 47:30.665
...however bad it is...

47:31.467 --> 47:33.103
you're both very lucky.

47:40.424 --> 47:43.560
I don't really know you at all, Howard,

47:43.726 --> 47:47.030
but whatever circumstance made you

47:47.490 --> 47:49.642
who you are...

47:51.355 --> 47:52.959
...you're better than him.

48:02.919 --> 48:05.088
I could stay here tonight.

48:05.168 --> 48:07.046
Crash on the couch.

48:11.194 --> 48:13.463
I don't need you to protect me.

48:14.809 --> 48:16.196
I know.

48:33.730 --> 48:35.907
Do you trust this man's intelligence?

48:37.541 --> 48:39.722
He has never been wrong.

48:47.284 --> 48:48.857
So there's a mole,

48:48.938 --> 48:50.507
someone from the other side,

48:51.210 --> 48:53.656
on my floor, under Aldrich's nose

48:53.681 --> 48:55.742
for... years.

48:55.858 --> 48:59.362
I mean, how is that even possible?

49:00.436 --> 49:02.622
Someone got to Emily.

49:03.059 --> 49:05.795
Who's to say they don't know
what you're doing, too?

49:10.386 --> 49:14.076
Bottom line is, I'm too exposed.

49:14.750 --> 49:16.312
Until you find out what's what,

49:16.337 --> 49:18.372
I think I need to stay out of it.

49:18.474 --> 49:19.975
And how you gonna do that?

49:21.691 --> 49:24.428
By being him, I guess.

49:24.708 --> 49:26.376
Best I can.

49:34.631 --> 49:37.801
That other Howard,
he was with his wife...

49:39.502 --> 49:41.004
...however many years.

49:41.504 --> 49:44.065
He had no idea about her?

49:44.221 --> 49:47.407
No.

49:48.878 --> 49:52.696
I guess loyalty is his biggest flaw.

49:56.084 --> 49:57.806
Mine, too.

52:40.209 --> 52:42.444
Not even a good-bye?

52:42.678 --> 52:45.949
I am clearly writing you a note.

52:48.992 --> 52:51.127
You know, we could help each other.

52:52.222 --> 52:54.432
I mean, the Office are watching me,

52:54.457 --> 52:56.422
but they're not watching you.

52:56.647 --> 52:59.316
There's a lot of stuff
going on out there.

53:00.463 --> 53:02.105
We could help him.

53:02.571 --> 53:04.093
Sure.

53:04.406 --> 53:06.809
Yeah, whatever I can do.

53:07.744 --> 53:11.924
That wouldn't be strange
for you at all?

53:13.021 --> 53:15.321
Us, together?

53:16.880 --> 53:19.115
I don't know.
Would it be strange for you?

53:19.561 --> 53:20.800
Yes.

53:21.090 --> 53:22.294
Yeah, okay.

53:26.736 --> 53:28.772
Okay, now I'm going.

53:29.711 --> 53:32.514
Uh... not taking your pen.

53:36.691 --> 53:38.237
Thank you.

54:12.676 --> 54:14.110
Morning.

54:14.643 --> 54:16.379
I'm going for a walk.

54:16.479 --> 54:18.495
Probably get a cup of tea,

54:18.667 --> 54:22.003
and then, uh, I think
I'll just keep walking

54:22.050 --> 54:25.254
and go wherever I want.

54:27.010 --> 54:28.897
I'd like to have his keys.

54:35.778 --> 54:36.980
Thank you.

54:37.027 --> 54:38.209
Next time you talk to him,

54:38.234 --> 54:40.036
tell him I love my new digs.
