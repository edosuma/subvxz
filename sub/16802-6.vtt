WEBVTT

00:03.044 --> 00:04.421
Amy: Previously on
"Heartland"...

00:04.462 --> 00:06.297
- Here are the teams:
Georgie and Adam,

00:06.339 --> 00:08.425
and Jade and Clay.

00:08.466 --> 00:10.176
Jade: Uh, no way.
Georgie: What's going on?

00:10.218 --> 00:11.553
- There's no way
I can work with Clay.

00:11.594 --> 00:13.054
You have to switch partners
with me.

00:13.096 --> 00:14.681
- I'd much rather be spending
time with my boyfriend
right now,

00:14.723 --> 00:16.391
but instead I'm stuck here
with you!

00:20.020 --> 00:24.399
- I mean, there's something
between us that's undeniable,

00:24.441 --> 00:28.361
but this new business, it's
gonna be my entire life and...

00:28.403 --> 00:30.238
I just wouldn't want you
to have to wait for me.

00:34.159 --> 00:39.873
**

00:39.914 --> 00:41.332
(Spartan whinnies sharply)

00:41.374 --> 00:43.668
Jack: Whoa, easy, easy, easy.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.837
(Spartan snorts)

00:45.879 --> 00:48.423
(Hooves thud)
- Easy. What are you thinkin'?

00:48.465 --> 00:51.551
Spartan! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

00:51.593 --> 00:53.303
Whoa, easy, easy.

00:53.345 --> 00:55.180
Settle down.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.431
- (Snorts)

00:57.640 --> 00:59.100
- Yeah.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.395
Amy: No, today is perfect.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.355
Yeah, come by any time.
(Hooves thud)

01:04.397 --> 01:06.608
Okay. I'm looking forward to it.

01:06.649 --> 01:08.735
(Spartan snorts loudly)

01:08.777 --> 01:09.903
- Another client?

01:09.944 --> 01:11.654
- Yeah, a riding instructor!

01:11.696 --> 01:13.281
Should be fun.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.367
- Hi, bud.
- Are you sure you don't want
to take a couple days off?

01:15.408 --> 01:17.660
You just finished up with Lex.

01:17.702 --> 01:19.704
- I appreciate your concern,
grandpa,

01:19.746 --> 01:21.664
but you're starting
to sound a bit like dad.

01:21.706 --> 01:23.917
- Okay, okay.

01:23.958 --> 01:27.003
Just tryin' to look out
for my granddaughter.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.797
- I know, but I'm fine.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.008
I am.

01:32.050 --> 01:35.512
- Okay. You've just been keepin'
yourself awfully busy is all.

01:35.553 --> 01:36.888
- I know what you're thinking,

01:36.930 --> 01:39.683
but this has nothing
to do with Ty.

01:39.724 --> 01:41.935
- All right.

01:41.976 --> 01:43.770
I'll be around if you need
any help.

01:43.812 --> 01:46.147
- Thanks, grandpa.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.151
(Country Music plays in diner)

01:53.029 --> 01:54.406
- Oh, that's so cute.

01:54.447 --> 01:57.242
Your boyfriend's back. Again.

01:57.283 --> 01:58.243
What is his superpower?

01:58.284 --> 01:59.577
Knowing your location
at all times?

01:59.619 --> 02:01.538
- Jade, be nice.

02:01.579 --> 02:03.998
- Come on, admit it.
It's a little much.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.500
Every shift you work,

02:05.542 --> 02:06.918
There he is sitting
at the counter.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.753
Georgie: It's not so bad.

02:09.795 --> 02:11.923
Okay, maybe it is a bit much.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.633
I love hanging out with Adam,

02:13.675 --> 02:15.969
just not every second
of every day.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.303
- Well, you better do something
about it

02:17.345 --> 02:20.348
before he decides to join
the Extreme Team or something.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.353
Actually, I'd pay money
to see that.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.647
Lisa: So many jars!

02:27.689 --> 02:30.442
Why are we keeping them?
Let's do some recycling!

02:30.483 --> 02:31.860
(Bottles clank)

02:31.901 --> 02:33.695
- I like this one!

02:33.737 --> 02:35.530
- Oh, you know what?

02:35.572 --> 02:36.906
There's so many, just put
it in the recycling box.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.825
Jack: You ladies are up
and at it early!

02:38.867 --> 02:41.453
Katie: I'm helping Lisa!
Jack: You are!

02:41.494 --> 02:43.371
Lisa: We are doing a little
tidying up

02:43.413 --> 02:45.874
so things are nice
when Lou gets here.

02:45.915 --> 02:47.042
How was your ride?

02:47.083 --> 02:50.045
- He gave me a bit of a hard
time, that horse.

02:50.086 --> 02:52.964
I know Spartan's always had
a bit of the nick in him,

02:53.006 --> 02:54.924
but, I don't know,

02:54.966 --> 02:56.801
(Water flows)
this feels like somethin' else.

02:56.843 --> 02:57.761
- Did you talk to Amy about it?

02:57.802 --> 03:01.014
- Oh, no. I didn't even mention
it to her.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.932
I think she's got enough
on her plate right now.

03:02.974 --> 03:04.267
- Speaking of which,

03:04.309 --> 03:06.519
I promised Georgie that I would
pick her up from Maggie's.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.104
Could you watch Katie
for a little bit?

03:08.146 --> 03:09.731
- Yes.
- Thank you, thank you.

03:09.773 --> 03:11.274
(Kiss) All right.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.484
I'll see ya.

03:12.525 --> 03:13.985
- Yup.
(Door opens)

03:14.027 --> 03:16.404
Where'd she go?
(Door shuts)

03:17.822 --> 03:19.491
- So, about this weekend...

03:19.532 --> 03:21.493
- I was thinking we could go
to a movie on Saturday

03:21.534 --> 03:23.161
and maybe check out
that new exhibit

03:23.203 --> 03:24.746
at the Science Centre on Sunday.

03:24.788 --> 03:27.624
- So, Saturday and Sunday, huh?

03:27.665 --> 03:28.958
- Do you have plans?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.669
Jade: (Clears throat loudly)

03:32.879 --> 03:34.464
- What?

03:34.506 --> 03:36.758
- Oh, nothing, it's just...

03:36.800 --> 03:38.843
I should probably just check
with Lou.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.888
She gets in today and she
probably has tons of stuff
planned.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.766
- Okay.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.269
- (Sighs)

03:49.729 --> 03:50.689
(Taxi rumbles)

03:57.028 --> 03:58.530
(Door opens)

04:01.825 --> 04:03.076
(Door shuts)

04:03.118 --> 04:04.661
- I coulda picked you up from
the airport you know.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.913
- It's fine. I grabbed an
earlier flight.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.456
- Oh, here let me help you
with this.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.666
- Thank you.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.251
- (Grunts with effort) Jeez!

04:11.292 --> 04:13.461
Someone went a little crazy
at the duty-free.

04:13.503 --> 04:14.838
(Grunts with effort)
- Maybe not there,

04:14.879 --> 04:16.005
but I might have gone
a little bit overboard

04:16.047 --> 04:17.757
with gifts for everyone.
(Trunk slams shut)

04:17.798 --> 04:20.427
- You? Overboard?
Can't picture it.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.012
Taxi dispatcher:
Dispatch to Car 1122.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.888
- Thank you.

04:23.930 --> 04:24.889
- Mmm hmm.
Taxi dispatcher: Car 1122
you're where?

04:24.931 --> 04:27.767
- So, how was New York?

04:27.809 --> 04:29.060
- It was great, actually.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.812
Better than anticipated.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.272
- I expect nothing less

04:32.313 --> 04:34.607
from Hudson's Entrepreneur
of the Year.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.526
- (Chuckles)

04:36.568 --> 04:38.737
You know, I don't really
feel right

04:38.778 --> 04:42.198
about the way we left things
before New York.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.034
- Now's not really a great
time, Lou.

04:44.075 --> 04:46.619
Uh, maybe we can talk soon
though?

04:46.661 --> 04:48.496
- Of course.

04:49.748 --> 04:50.790
- Welcome home.

04:53.251 --> 04:55.587
(Dog barks in the distance)

04:57.589 --> 04:58.840
(Truck rumbles)

05:02.052 --> 05:04.346
- Hi, I'm looking
for Amy Fleming?

05:06.556 --> 05:08.892
Amy?
- Hi, you must be Rhonda,

05:08.933 --> 05:11.561
and this must be the guy
who's biting all your students.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.646
- Yeah, he is. And you're...

05:14.939 --> 05:18.151
- Expecting. Yeah, it's our
first. We're pretty excited.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.527
- You're not riding while
you're pregnant, are you?

05:19.569 --> 05:20.987
- No, I'm not.

05:21.029 --> 05:24.240
- Okay, then. Uh, I'm sorry. I
don't think this is gonna work.

05:24.282 --> 05:27.285
- Why? Because I'm expecting?

05:27.327 --> 05:28.912
- Well, in order for you to be
able to fix my horse

05:28.953 --> 05:30.747
you need to be able to ride,

05:30.789 --> 05:33.208
and how are you supposed to
do that if you're pregnant?

05:33.249 --> 05:35.001
You should've mentioned
this on the phone.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.670
- I, I can still help you--

05:36.711 --> 05:37.587
You know what?
Don't worry about it.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.005
We'll find someone else.

05:44.010 --> 05:54.104
**

05:54.104 --> 05:59.734
**

05:59.776 --> 06:04.739
* And at the break of day
you sank into your dream *

06:06.741 --> 06:07.951
* You dreamer *

06:07.992 --> 06:10.704
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

06:10.745 --> 06:12.414
* You dreamer *

06:15.166 --> 06:18.586
* You dreamer *

06:20.171 --> 06:26.594
**

06:26.636 --> 06:27.637
- (Annoyed sigh)

06:27.679 --> 06:29.681
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.224
Oh, oh, mmm, mmm.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.643
- Right. I can't even have
real tea anymore!

06:33.685 --> 06:35.603
- Okay, why don't
you have a seat

06:35.645 --> 06:38.773
and I'll make ya
a cup of your tea.

06:38.815 --> 06:42.610
- You mean my raspberry lemon
no-caffeine, no-taste tea?

06:42.652 --> 06:44.237
- (Laughs) Yeah that's
the stuff.

06:44.279 --> 06:46.156
- (Annoyed sigh)
Is this what pregnancy's like?

06:46.197 --> 06:48.575
Is this what my life is gonna
be like from now on,

06:48.616 --> 06:50.076
everybody treating me
like an invalid?

06:50.118 --> 06:51.661
This is ridiculous!

06:51.703 --> 06:53.747
Did mom ride when she was
pregnant? I bet she did.

06:53.788 --> 06:57.792
- Well, you know, people did
a lot of things back then

06:57.834 --> 06:59.502
that they probably
shouldn't have.

06:59.544 --> 07:02.297
- I just think it's crazy.
I don't know why I can't ride.

07:02.339 --> 07:05.050
Even Cassandra said the baby's
well-protected in the womb.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.843
- Is everything okay with you?

07:06.885 --> 07:10.180
'Cause you seem
a little on edge.

07:10.221 --> 07:12.015
- You know that client
I was telling you about,

07:12.057 --> 07:14.100
the riding instructor?
- Yeah.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.144
- She took one look at me
and turned tail.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.646
How am I supposed to keep
working without any clients?

07:18.688 --> 07:19.689
- Come on now,

07:19.731 --> 07:21.775
we both know you've helped
plenty of horses

07:21.816 --> 07:23.360
without riding them.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.737
Don't get all wound up.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.781
- I know, grandpa, it's just...

07:27.822 --> 07:29.741
I wanted my life to stay
as normal as possible

07:29.783 --> 07:30.992
until this baby came,

07:31.034 --> 07:32.869
and so far it's changing
so quickly.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.704
Lou: I thought I heard
a familiar voice!

07:34.746 --> 07:36.331
- Lou, I didn't even know
you were back!

07:36.373 --> 07:39.709
- Hey! (Gasps) Look at you.
You're showing!

07:39.751 --> 07:42.003
You look amazing.
- I don't feel amazing.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.005
- Aw...
- Nobody told me about
the heartburn.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.049
- Ugh, yes, one of the many
joys of pregnancy.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.717
Amy: (Sighs)
(Door opens)

07:47.759 --> 07:50.053
- Mom!
- Sweetheart!

07:50.095 --> 07:52.972
(Kiss) Let me look at you.
I missed you!

07:53.014 --> 07:55.767
And look at you in your
adorable Maggie's uniform!

07:55.809 --> 07:58.853
How do you like working there?
- It's pretty awesome!

07:58.895 --> 08:00.814
- Hi.
- Lisa, thank you so much!

08:00.855 --> 08:03.400
- Welcome home. My pleasure.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.527
Okay, I hope you're not
scheduled this weekend,

08:05.568 --> 08:08.238
because I want to do something
with just the three of us -

08:08.279 --> 08:10.865
me, you and Katie.
- Sounds fun.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.451
- You don't seem excited.
- Well, it's just...

08:13.493 --> 08:14.411
I was supposed to hang out
with Adam.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.079
He wants to see a movie.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.331
- How come that sounds
like such a chore?

08:18.373 --> 08:21.543
- It's not. I should probably
go get changed.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.296
- What was that about?
- I have no idea.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.382
- Maybe a little trouble
in paradise?

08:27.424 --> 08:31.052
- Well, I was booked but now my
schedule's completely open,

08:31.094 --> 08:33.304
so I'm gonna go to Maggie's
and pick up the feed order.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.431
But I do want hear
all about New York,

08:34.472 --> 08:35.849
so we'll catch up later?

08:35.890 --> 08:38.183
- Sound good.
All right, Kitty Kat!

08:38.226 --> 08:40.227
It's gonna be just
me and you this weekend.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.938
- Nope!
- What?! Don't tell me you have
plans too?

08:42.981 --> 08:46.109
Lisa: Abraham's birthday party.
Lou: Oh, okay.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.820
Well, that's fine. No big deal.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.573
- Can we go pick some flowers?
- Sure.

08:55.452 --> 08:56.995
Do we have enough?

09:00.123 --> 09:01.374
- Monty!

09:01.416 --> 09:04.002
- Honey, don't go too far, okay?
- Okay.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.421
Lou: Stay where mommy
can see you.
- All right.

09:06.463 --> 09:09.049
- Going fishing?
- Yeah.
(Door closes)

09:09.090 --> 09:10.508
I asked Jack for a couple
days off,

09:10.550 --> 09:13.136
so I'm headed to his secret
spot in Moose Creek.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.096
- Katie and I went for a picnic
there last summer.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.765
It's beautiful.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.016
Not to brag,

09:18.058 --> 09:19.934
but I used to be pretty good
at fly fishing myself.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.770
- What? You fish?

09:21.811 --> 09:23.396
- Yeah, don't look so surprised.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.357
My dad took me.
He said I was a natural.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.359
- We should go sometime.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.361
- Yeah, I'd like that.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.945
- Yeah, me too.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.451
Well, I should, uh,
should head out.
- Okay.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.119
(Chuckles)

09:38.161 --> 09:39.996
- Thank you.
- (Laughs) You're welcome.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.122
(Door opens)

09:43.333 --> 09:45.543
(Door shuts)
(Truck starts up)

09:45.585 --> 09:48.129
- Have fun.
- Thanks. I will.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.132
(Truck rumbles)

09:54.386 --> 09:55.804
- (Chuckles)

10:00.266 --> 10:02.727
- You're quiet. What's wrong?

10:02.769 --> 10:05.105
- Oh, nothing.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.023
- Tell me.

10:07.065 --> 10:09.401
- I'm just worried about Amy.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.861
She had a client cancel
on her this morning

10:11.903 --> 10:14.072
and only because
she was pregnant.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.949
- What?! You're kidding.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.785
- Ah, I think it kinda
shook her up.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.038
- Well...

10:22.080 --> 10:24.332
let's get her some new clients.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.333
I'll make some calls.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.584
In fact,

10:26.626 --> 10:28.545
yeah, I think I know someone
who would be perfect.

10:28.586 --> 10:31.006
- But whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.924
I don't think we should
interfere.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.010
- Oh, nonsense.
That's what families do.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.261
(Phone beeps)

10:36.302 --> 10:37.679
Interfere.

10:38.888 --> 10:43.435
**

10:43.476 --> 10:45.687
(Truck rumbles)

10:51.234 --> 10:53.403
- Amy!

10:53.445 --> 10:55.864
You've gotta come see this!

10:59.492 --> 11:01.161
(Loud thwack)

11:01.202 --> 11:02.704
- That's pretty impressive!

11:02.746 --> 11:05.290
You know, even the hunters
I know aren't that accurate!

11:05.331 --> 11:06.916
- It takes a lot of practice.

11:06.958 --> 11:09.544
- Norah, this is Amy,
my granddaughter.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.296
Amy, this is Norah.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.423
- Hi.
Jack: Her mom's a friend
of Lisa's.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.342
- Well, it's nice to meet you.
- It's a pleasure.

11:15.383 --> 11:18.470
- Norah here is a mounted
archer.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.472
- She's does that on horseback.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.474
- Wow! That's amazing.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.309
- Yeah, she's a pretty big deal.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.020
She's competed
all over the world.

11:27.062 --> 11:28.313
Norah: I've been dying
to work with you,

11:28.355 --> 11:30.690
and when Lisa told me about
you cancellation this morning

11:30.732 --> 11:33.151
I packed up the truck
and I came right over.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.236
- Why's that?

11:36.488 --> 11:38.073
- I need your help.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.326
- I would love to,

11:41.368 --> 11:44.704
but the timing's not right.
Full disclosure: I'm pregnant.

11:44.746 --> 11:48.333
- Congrats! I just had a baby
ten months ago.

11:48.375 --> 11:52.170
- Really? Well, that's great.
- Yeah, it is great,

11:52.212 --> 11:55.590
but ever since, me and my horse
have been outta sync,

11:55.632 --> 11:56.716
and the way things
are going now,

11:56.758 --> 12:00.470
I don't know if we'll ever
get back to competing.

12:00.512 --> 12:03.932
- (Sighs)
- Take a look at Doc, please?

12:03.973 --> 12:06.976
I really value your opinion.

12:07.018 --> 12:09.604
- Okay, I... I'll have a look.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.773
- Thanks!

12:16.945 --> 12:18.488
- (Chuckles)

12:18.530 --> 12:20.115
Hello? Tim.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.410
Yup. Amy? She's good.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.747
What?!

12:27.789 --> 12:31.501
How would I know if she's
getting enough folic acid, ya--

12:31.543 --> 12:34.629
You know what? I'll just-
I'll have her call ya.

12:34.671 --> 12:37.882
Say hi to Casey
at the hot springs.

12:37.924 --> 12:38.967
(Phone beeps off)

12:39.009 --> 12:40.301
- Tim again, huh?

12:40.343 --> 12:43.138
- Yeah, you know, if I have
to listen to him any more

12:43.179 --> 12:45.056
about his pregnancy nonsense.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.976
You know, it's like he's the
one that's havin' a baby!

12:48.018 --> 12:49.978
- Well, imagine how Amy feels.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.189
How did things go out there
with Amy and Norah?

12:53.231 --> 12:54.899
- Oh good. There're out there
right now.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.151
- Good!

12:58.361 --> 12:59.571
- Are you lookin' for something?

12:59.612 --> 13:02.073
- Yeah, well, I was gonna make
my stew for tomorrow,

13:02.115 --> 13:04.200
kind of a welcome home dinner
for Lou,

13:04.242 --> 13:06.578
but I can't see my jar in here.

13:06.619 --> 13:10.498
- A jar?
- Yeah, it's supposed to be
right here.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.042
- What did it look like?

13:12.083 --> 13:14.377
- Well, it's a jar.

13:14.419 --> 13:17.047
It's got a white top,
some tape on it, some marks.

13:17.088 --> 13:20.342
It's how I measure my-
my spices for the stew.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.428
- Okay.

13:23.470 --> 13:26.264
(Hooves thud)

13:26.306 --> 13:28.183
- This is so cool!
- (Laughs)

13:29.392 --> 13:31.311
(Hard thwack) (Hooves thud)

13:32.687 --> 13:34.189
- Easy, Doc!

13:35.648 --> 13:36.608
(Doc snorts loudly) Doc!

13:36.649 --> 13:38.360
Come on!

13:44.449 --> 13:47.160
See? That's what
I'm talking about.

13:47.202 --> 13:48.536
If Doc pulled that during
competition

13:48.578 --> 13:50.205
we'd be disqualified.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.458
I'm sorry! I just...

13:54.793 --> 13:55.752
really want to prove
to everyone

13:55.794 --> 13:57.712
that I've still got it.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.506
- I know what you mean.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.384
(Bottles clank)

14:05.303 --> 14:06.680
- Hey Lisa!
- Hey!

14:06.721 --> 14:07.639
(Exhales nervously)

14:07.681 --> 14:10.266
You startled me.

14:10.308 --> 14:11.434
- Are you looking for
something?

14:11.476 --> 14:13.853
- Yeah, just something
in the recycling.

14:13.895 --> 14:15.397
- Oh, grandpa probably
took it to the depot.

14:15.438 --> 14:18.316
- No, it was here today.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.776
- Is everything okay?

14:19.818 --> 14:23.822
- I think I accidentally threw
out your grandfather's jar.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.281
- You threw out grandpa's jar?!

14:25.323 --> 14:27.534
- I know! I don't know what
the big deal is.

14:27.575 --> 14:30.495
- He needs it for his stew!
- Yes, so he said.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.080
I don't know what that means,
but you know...

14:34.124 --> 14:35.458
(Bottles clank)

14:35.500 --> 14:38.294
You know what?
(Bottles clank)

14:38.336 --> 14:41.006
I'm gonna buy him a new one.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.049
Jack will never know!

14:45.176 --> 14:46.594
- Jack will never know what?

14:48.805 --> 14:50.765
- Well, I'd love to work
with Doc.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.351
I'd like to see how he responds
to liberty.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.145
- Liberty? You think
that'll help?

14:55.186 --> 14:59.190
- Yeah, it's definitely a great
way to get back the oneness
you used to share.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.483
Can I work with him
a little first?

15:00.525 --> 15:04.362
- Absolutely.
- Thanks.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.322
- Um, hey, Norah,

15:06.364 --> 15:08.742
do you think you could teach me
some mounted archery stuff

15:08.783 --> 15:09.993
while Amy works with
your horse?

15:10.035 --> 15:12.662
- Sure! I'd love to! But you
have to start on your feet.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.205
- Okay!

15:14.247 --> 15:15.206
(Hard thwack)

15:17.667 --> 15:22.380
- Okay, so, you want to attach
the nock of the arrow here.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.757
- Okay.

15:23.798 --> 15:26.468
- Then you just drawback
towards your ear or your chin,

15:26.509 --> 15:28.178
whatever you're more
comfortable with,

15:28.219 --> 15:30.221
and release.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.389
(Hard thwack)

15:31.431 --> 15:32.390
- Wow.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.600
Okay.

15:36.353 --> 15:37.604
Norah: Mmm hmm.

15:43.568 --> 15:46.488
(Soft thud)

15:46.529 --> 15:48.698
Okay, try putting three fingers

15:48.740 --> 15:51.493
underneath the arrow,
supporting it.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.164
- Like this?
- Perfect.

15:56.206 --> 15:57.499
- Okay.
- Try again.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.752
(Hard thwack)

16:00.794 --> 16:02.629
- I hit it!
- (Excited laugh)

16:02.671 --> 16:04.464
Not bad! You're gettin' it!

16:04.506 --> 16:06.633
- Thank you so much
for all your help!
- No worries.

16:06.675 --> 16:08.760
- Here.
- Oh, keep it.

16:08.802 --> 16:11.304
- Really?
- Yeah, well,
for the weekend anyway.

16:11.346 --> 16:14.015
Have some fun practicing. Bye!
- Bye!

16:16.893 --> 16:19.187
(Cell phone beeps)

16:25.902 --> 16:27.529
Adam: Why not?

16:27.570 --> 16:28.947
Georgie: (On phone) I just
don't think I can hang out
this weekend.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.448
Amy's working with this
mounted archer

16:30.490 --> 16:31.658
and she lent me some equipment

16:31.700 --> 16:35.245
I can only use
for the next two days.

16:35.286 --> 16:37.038
You're not mad, are you?

16:38.289 --> 16:40.417
- No, it's fine.

16:40.458 --> 16:41.835
Georgie: Okay, well,

16:41.876 --> 16:43.628
it might be nice to have
some space, you know,

16:43.670 --> 16:47.465
give us a chance to miss
each other a little.

16:47.507 --> 16:50.260
- Right. Okay.

16:50.301 --> 16:52.303
Bye.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.596
- Okay.

16:53.638 --> 16:56.266
Bye.

16:56.307 --> 16:59.185
(Phone beeps off)
(Troubled sigh)

17:05.483 --> 17:06.943
Amy: So New York was amazing?

17:06.984 --> 17:08.944
- Oh, you have no idea.

17:08.987 --> 17:11.781
Look at this space we found
in Brooklyn.

17:11.823 --> 17:12.656
(Spartan snorts)
- Oh wow.

17:12.699 --> 17:13.700
- It's perfect.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.285
(Spartan snorts angrily)
(Hoof bangs stall)

17:15.326 --> 17:16.327
- Whoa.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.621
(Spartan snorts angrily)

17:18.663 --> 17:20.415
Since when did Spartan
become such a diva?

17:20.457 --> 17:21.915
- He's been acting like this
for days.

17:21.958 --> 17:23.417
I don't know what's
gotten into him.

17:23.460 --> 17:26.003
- Wait a minute, you don't
know what's gotten into
your own horse?

17:26.046 --> 17:28.381
(Hoof bangs stall)
- I don't! Grandpa's been
riding him daily.

17:28.423 --> 17:30.675
There's no reason for him
to be this upset.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.594
(Spartan snorts angrily)

17:32.635 --> 17:34.596
- Poor guy.

17:34.637 --> 17:42.687
**

17:42.729 --> 17:43.730
(Hard thwack)

17:48.360 --> 17:50.528
(Door shuts)

17:50.570 --> 17:51.529
Clay: Hey, Georgie, what's up?

17:51.571 --> 17:52.614
(Hard thwack)

17:52.655 --> 17:54.449
Georgie: Nothing.
What are you doing here?

17:54.491 --> 17:55.867
- Tim said I could borrow
some equipment

17:55.909 --> 17:58.745
while he's out of town.

17:58.787 --> 18:01.581
You know you're supposed
to aim for the middle, right?

18:01.623 --> 18:03.333
- What, you think you could
do better?

18:03.375 --> 18:05.001
- (Chuckles) Probably.

18:05.043 --> 18:06.294
- Of course you can.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.004
Clay's great at everything.

18:08.046 --> 18:09.589
- That's awfully nice
of you to say.

18:09.631 --> 18:12.300
- I was being sarcastic!
- Ouch.

18:12.342 --> 18:13.677
After how much fun
we had orienteering?

18:13.718 --> 18:15.720
That hurts.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.098
Now give me the bow.
Let me show you how it's done.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.310
- You're holding it wrong.

18:23.728 --> 18:25.313
- Hey!
- Hi Lisa!

18:25.355 --> 18:26.981
- Good morning, ladies.

18:27.023 --> 18:31.653
Wait till you see what
I found at the new kitchen
boutique in town!

18:31.695 --> 18:33.071
- (Chuckles)
(Bottles clank)

18:33.113 --> 18:35.699
Jack: And just what
do we have here?

18:35.740 --> 18:38.368
- Well, we don't need
an old outdated jar.

18:38.410 --> 18:41.746
We can find the recipe
ourselves.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.582
- That jar was my recipe, Lise.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.793
Without it... there is no stew.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.005
Lisa: Come on, give it a try.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.715
Who knows? Maybe the stew
you're about to make

18:51.756 --> 18:53.633
may be even better.

18:56.011 --> 18:58.847
(Whip whips)
- (Clicks tongue)

18:58.888 --> 19:01.599
(Whistles)
(Doc snorts)

19:01.641 --> 19:03.727
(Whip whips)
(Whistles)

19:03.768 --> 19:05.770
(Whip whips)
(Clicks tongue)

19:05.812 --> 19:07.605
Good boy!

19:07.647 --> 19:09.399
(Clicks tongue)
(Doc snorts)

19:09.441 --> 19:10.525
(Clicks tongue)

19:10.567 --> 19:11.693
Come on, come on.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.362
Come on.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.699
Good boy, Doc!

19:21.077 --> 19:22.829
(Doc snorts)
(Clicks tongue)

19:22.871 --> 19:25.665
(Whip whips)
(Whistles)

19:25.707 --> 19:28.585
- Who knew the old boy
could be so graceful?

19:28.626 --> 19:31.421
Amy: He catches on
pretty quick!

19:31.463 --> 19:33.965
- Seems like Doc is really
bonding with you but...

19:34.007 --> 19:35.717
I got to ask, isn't the point
of all this

19:35.759 --> 19:36.801
to get him to bond with me?

19:36.843 --> 19:38.511
- Well, that's the next step.

19:38.553 --> 19:40.472
I would like to see you do some
liberty work with him.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.433
What do you think?
- (Nervous laugh)

19:43.475 --> 19:45.935
I think liberty looks
a lot like dancing

19:45.977 --> 19:47.479
and I was never
the ballet kinda girl.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.688
- (Laughs)

19:48.730 --> 19:50.982
Well, it's not about being
delicate or dainty,

19:51.024 --> 19:52.984
it's about being one
with your horse.

19:53.026 --> 19:55.487
Give it a try?

19:55.528 --> 19:57.781
- Okay, but no laughing.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.324
- I promise.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.784
- You either.

20:00.825 --> 20:02.619
- (Laughs)
- Boy.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.954
Okay.

20:04.996 --> 20:07.374
(Doc snorts)
Come on!

20:07.415 --> 20:09.417
Good boy!

20:09.459 --> 20:10.710
- That's it.

20:10.752 --> 20:12.337
(Doc snorts)

20:16.007 --> 20:18.301
- Good boy!

20:18.343 --> 20:20.428
(Doc snorts)

20:20.470 --> 20:21.930
Amy: There you go!

20:21.971 --> 20:24.015
Norah: Good boy. Come on.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.600
(Pants)

20:28.478 --> 20:30.397
- I feel stupid!
- (Laughing)

20:32.732 --> 20:34.359
- (Gasping) Okay.

20:36.736 --> 20:37.987
(Gasps for air)

20:38.029 --> 20:39.572
I'm totally winded!

20:39.614 --> 20:40.907
- Really? Well let's take
a little break.

20:40.949 --> 20:42.534
- Yeah.
- You guys keep up the bonding.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.327
- Okay.
- (Chuckles)

20:44.369 --> 20:45.870
- Good boy.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.622
(Hard thwack)

20:47.664 --> 20:48.957
- (Satisfied exhale)

20:50.834 --> 20:53.169
- Here. So, you talk to Jade
lately?

20:53.211 --> 20:54.796
- Yeah, all the time.

20:54.838 --> 20:57.549
- Yeah? What she say about me?

20:57.590 --> 20:59.884
- Pretty much nothing.
(Hard thwack)

20:59.926 --> 21:02.262
- (Chuckles) I have a hard time
believing that.

21:02.303 --> 21:05.181
- See? That's exactly the kind
of macho crap

21:05.223 --> 21:06.599
Jade hates about you.

21:06.641 --> 21:09.436
- Ah ha, so she does talk
about me!

21:10.729 --> 21:11.896
(Hard thwack)

21:11.938 --> 21:14.441
- Just shut up
and take your shot.

21:14.482 --> 21:18.236
- Oh. Let's, uh,
get a picture of this.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.572
It's gonna be epic.
- Okay.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.324
(Sighs)

21:26.077 --> 21:28.329
(Camera click)

21:29.539 --> 21:30.290
- Perfect.

21:35.545 --> 21:36.504
(Hard thwack)

21:37.797 --> 21:40.342
Also perfect.
Well, see you later.

21:41.593 --> 21:43.678
Good luck with this, Katniss!

21:45.138 --> 21:46.431
- (Sighs)

21:48.683 --> 21:50.769
- Hey, you drop Katie off?
- Yeah.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.020
Since when does my 5-year old

21:52.062 --> 21:53.563
have a more exciting
social life than me?

21:53.605 --> 21:55.148
- Come on, Lou, you just
got back.

21:55.190 --> 21:57.108
- Yeah, I know,
but I was kinda hoping

21:57.150 --> 21:58.610
that I could just pick up where
I left off.

21:58.651 --> 21:59.819
- You have, haven't you?

21:59.861 --> 22:01.613
- Not with everyone.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.656
- Mitch.

22:03.698 --> 22:05.784
- I want to be honest with him
about how I feel, Amy.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.744
I want to tell him that the
whole time I was in New York,

22:07.786 --> 22:09.245
I couldn't stop thinking
about him.

22:09.287 --> 22:12.665
- I have never heard you talk
about Mitch like this.

22:12.707 --> 22:14.751
Sounds like you really
missed him.
- I did.

22:14.793 --> 22:17.837
You know, you're right.
This is big, Amy.

22:17.879 --> 22:19.297
Do you think I should
go talk to him?

22:19.339 --> 22:20.715
- Didn't he go away
for the weekend?

22:20.757 --> 22:23.426
- Yeah, but he practically
invited me along.
- Practically?

22:23.468 --> 22:26.554
- Yeah, we were talking about
fishing and he said we should
go sometime,

22:26.596 --> 22:27.931
but Katie was there and...

22:27.972 --> 22:30.809
I don't know, I felt like there
was more he wanted to say.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.894
I bet he thought I was just busy
all weekend with the girls.

22:32.936 --> 22:35.105
- Yeah, probably.

22:35.146 --> 22:37.649
- You know what,
Amy, you're right.

22:37.691 --> 22:39.067
I need to go out there,

22:39.109 --> 22:40.819
and I need to tell him
how I feel.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.237
- Well, are you sure?

22:42.278 --> 22:45.740
- Yeah! 'Cause if I don't,
maybe I never will.

22:45.782 --> 22:47.409
Thank you.

22:49.744 --> 22:51.329
- For what?

22:51.371 --> 22:54.040
(Birds chirp)
(Water gently flows)

22:58.211 --> 23:00.005
(Chain clinks)

23:00.046 --> 23:07.512
**

23:07.554 --> 23:09.597
(Brush rustles)

23:09.639 --> 23:11.641
Lou: (Pants)

23:11.683 --> 23:13.018
Uh... (Chain clinks)

23:13.059 --> 23:14.853
Lou?
Lou: Hi.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.646
- What, what are you doin' here?

23:16.688 --> 23:18.857
- You said we should
go fishing sometime.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.151
The girls are busy today so...

23:21.192 --> 23:22.944
I thought it'd be nice to spend
the day together.

23:22.986 --> 23:25.780
Give us a chance to talk.

23:25.822 --> 23:28.033
- Uh...

23:28.074 --> 23:29.951
Talk, yeah, um...
(Fishing rod clicks)

23:29.993 --> 23:32.829
You know, most people they come
out here for the solitude.

23:32.871 --> 23:35.707
Talking's really not part
of the equation.

23:35.749 --> 23:37.625
- Oh, all right, um...

23:40.086 --> 23:41.880
I'll just stay out
of your way then.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.965
You won't even know I'm here.

23:46.843 --> 23:48.678
- (Exhales)

23:48.720 --> 23:50.055
(Fishing rod clicks)

23:50.096 --> 23:51.473
(Brush rustles)

23:52.932 --> 23:54.059
- (Grunts)

23:54.100 --> 23:56.561
Oof!
(Brush rattles)

24:00.357 --> 24:02.650
- Not really catchin' much
over there, are ya?

24:02.692 --> 24:04.235
- (Exhales)

24:04.277 --> 24:06.112
You got any pointers?

24:06.154 --> 24:08.740
- I thought you were a natural.
(Lure plops in water)

24:08.782 --> 24:10.658
- Yeah, I uh...

24:12.744 --> 24:15.080
My dad never took me
fishing growing up.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.874
I kinda made that up.

24:17.916 --> 24:19.459
He was always busy
on the rodeo circuit.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.711
He wasn't around much
when I was a kid.

24:21.753 --> 24:23.088
- Daddy issues.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.923
Starting to make a lot more
sense to me now.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.841
- Hey, I do not have
daddy issues!

24:26.883 --> 24:28.927
- Oh no? Coulda fooled me.

24:31.304 --> 24:33.181
(Lines whip, lures plop)

24:39.896 --> 24:41.022
(Resigned exhale)

24:45.985 --> 24:48.613
You're not movin'
your line enough.

24:48.655 --> 24:49.781
- What?

24:49.823 --> 24:51.366
(Water sloshes)

24:51.408 --> 24:53.451
- You know...

24:53.493 --> 24:56.496
the key to fly fishing is to
match the movement of your fly

24:56.538 --> 24:58.707
with the movement
of an actual insect.

24:58.748 --> 24:59.791
- I know.

25:02.127 --> 25:04.045
- Here, let me show you.

25:07.757 --> 25:08.883
(Line whips)

25:12.137 --> 25:13.888
See that?
- Yeah.

25:13.930 --> 25:15.515
- Back...
(Line whips)

25:16.683 --> 25:18.893
Yeah. Like that.

25:18.935 --> 25:20.854
- Like this?
(Line whips)

25:22.856 --> 25:24.816
- Yeah.

25:24.858 --> 25:26.943
- See? I'm a natural.

25:26.985 --> 25:28.570
- (Chuckles)

25:30.113 --> 25:31.239
Good. You're good.

25:32.449 --> 25:34.200
(Water sloshes)

25:39.998 --> 25:41.666
(Water sloshes)

25:45.128 --> 25:47.005
Amy: Okay, let's try this again.

25:47.047 --> 25:48.089
(Hooves thud)

25:49.215 --> 25:51.259
(Dramatic music)

25:51.301 --> 25:52.677
(Loud thwack)

25:52.719 --> 25:53.928
(Dramatic music)

25:59.851 --> 26:00.935
- (Gasps)
(Doc whinnies sharply)

26:00.977 --> 26:02.270
(Grunts with pain)

26:02.312 --> 26:04.606
- Norah!

26:06.941 --> 26:10.278
- (Sighs)
Amy: Norah, are you okay?

26:10.320 --> 26:11.529
- Yeah, I'm fine.

26:11.571 --> 26:13.990
- I'm so sorry. I really
thought you guys were ready.

26:14.032 --> 26:16.242
I don't know what happened.

26:16.284 --> 26:19.704
- Maybe you were right.
Maybe you can't help us.

26:23.917 --> 26:26.169
(Birds chirp)
(Water laps gently)

26:26.211 --> 26:28.254
- Oh my God, I think I caught
something.

26:28.296 --> 26:30.840
Mitch!
(Fishing rod clicks)
I think I caught a fish!

26:30.882 --> 26:32.175
- What?
- I caught a fish!

26:32.217 --> 26:34.344
- Really?
- (Excited gasp)

26:34.386 --> 26:37.222
- All right, easy, easy, easy,
easy, easy!
- Oh it feels heavy! Whoa.

26:37.263 --> 26:38.932
- Whoa! (Shrieks)
- I got him, I got him,
I got him, I got him.

26:38.973 --> 26:40.141
Reel him in.
- Get away!

26:40.183 --> 26:42.519
- Yup, one minute.
(Grunts with effort)

26:42.560 --> 26:44.145
- Got it?
- Yup.

26:45.980 --> 26:47.232
- (Excited squeal)

26:47.273 --> 26:49.317
- Oh wow, you're a natural
after all!
- See? Yeah.

26:49.359 --> 26:51.736
- Okay.
- Whoa.
- So now what?

26:51.778 --> 26:53.446
- Well...

26:53.488 --> 26:55.740
the law says we gotta
throw him back so uh...

26:55.782 --> 26:57.075
- Okay.

26:57.117 --> 26:59.661
- (Chuckles)
(Water sloshes)

27:01.788 --> 27:03.289
- That was fun.

27:04.374 --> 27:07.669
- Yeah. Good job.
- Thank you.

27:09.087 --> 27:10.839
- Well... (Chuckles)

27:17.262 --> 27:19.347
(Chain clanks)

27:21.349 --> 27:23.768
Lou, I think you should go.

27:23.810 --> 27:26.104
- What?!

27:26.146 --> 27:28.148
- You know, I... I came up here
to be alone

27:28.189 --> 27:32.110
and I don't know why you can't
respect that.

27:32.152 --> 27:33.194
(Chain clinks)

27:34.446 --> 27:37.198
- I'm sorry. This was obviously
a mistake.

27:44.205 --> 27:45.457
You know, it was a mistake
to think that

27:45.498 --> 27:47.917
we could actually behave
like adults for once

27:47.959 --> 27:50.045
and express how
we actually feel!

27:51.296 --> 27:53.715
Enjoy your solitude.

28:02.515 --> 28:04.184
- (Crying)

28:13.318 --> 28:14.903
(Door opens)

28:18.573 --> 28:20.200
(Door shuts)

28:22.952 --> 28:24.412
- Rough day?

28:25.955 --> 28:28.083
- I'm in over my head, Lou.

28:30.710 --> 28:31.961
(Tearful) I can't seem to fix
the connection

28:32.003 --> 28:35.674
Between my client
and her horse.

28:35.715 --> 28:39.427
What, what if I can't work with
horses the same way anymore?

28:41.346 --> 28:44.015
I just wish Ty was here.
- I know.

28:45.558 --> 28:46.726
(Sighs) I know.

28:48.269 --> 28:50.313
- (Sniffs)

28:50.355 --> 28:52.565
I must be crazy

28:52.607 --> 28:56.152
to let my husband travel
halfway around the world

28:56.194 --> 28:57.362
where there's poachers.

28:57.404 --> 29:00.365
I mean that's dangerous, right?

29:00.407 --> 29:02.575
And...

29:02.617 --> 29:06.538
You know, I think I've made
a terrible mistake.

29:06.579 --> 29:10.458
I thought I could do this
without him, but I can't.

29:13.586 --> 29:15.922
And, and babies!

29:17.507 --> 29:20.802
The only baby I've ever held
has been Katie and...

29:22.554 --> 29:24.806
I get horses, Lou, but kids?

29:26.099 --> 29:28.351
- Listen, you're just
freaking out

29:28.393 --> 29:31.688
because you had a tough day
and you're pregnant.

29:31.730 --> 29:34.357
You're allowed to freak out.

29:34.399 --> 29:36.568
- What if I can't fix
this horse, Lou?

29:36.609 --> 29:38.069
- I know you.

29:38.111 --> 29:40.196
You are gonna find the solution.

29:40.238 --> 29:43.074
You're the miracle girl, right?

29:43.116 --> 29:46.453
- I used to be.
- Still are.

29:50.623 --> 29:52.584
- Yeah.

29:52.625 --> 29:55.003
Hey, how did...

29:55.045 --> 29:56.588
how did it go with Mitch?

29:56.629 --> 29:59.341
- Oh, don't ask.

29:59.382 --> 30:01.176
I should never have taken
your advice.

30:03.053 --> 30:04.929
- (Laughs)

30:04.971 --> 30:06.681
(Crickets chirp)

30:06.723 --> 30:08.475
(Cutlery clinks)

30:12.187 --> 30:14.689
Katie: Can I go play, mommy?
- Sure, sweetheart.

30:14.731 --> 30:17.859
(Cutlery clinks)

30:21.363 --> 30:23.656
- How do you like the stew?

30:23.698 --> 30:25.533
- Oh, uh...

30:27.410 --> 30:29.287
Yeah, it's okay I guess.

30:30.747 --> 30:33.667
It has a little bit
of a sour flavor.

30:33.708 --> 30:36.294
- (Disapproving grunt)
(Foot thuds on floor)

30:36.336 --> 30:39.172
- I knew it. You are all
terrible liars!

30:40.423 --> 30:42.258
- What, it's not bad,
it's just different!

30:42.300 --> 30:43.677
(Cutlery clinks)

30:43.718 --> 30:45.845
- Come on, come on, come on,
it's not that bad.

30:45.887 --> 30:48.181
It just needs a little refining
on the recipe.

30:48.223 --> 30:49.891
No, grandpa. N-no...

31:01.361 --> 31:04.155
(Sighs heavily)

31:04.197 --> 31:06.408
- Your other half's not here.

31:06.449 --> 31:08.243
- I know.

31:08.284 --> 31:10.370
I'm not here to for Georgie.
I'm here for a milkshake.

31:13.748 --> 31:16.668
- Look, I know it's none
of my business,

31:16.710 --> 31:19.462
but a little word of advice...

31:19.504 --> 31:22.674
maybe try being a little
less available.

31:22.716 --> 31:25.135
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

31:25.176 --> 31:27.137
You stick to Georgie
like a shadow.

31:27.178 --> 31:28.763
- I like to spend time with her.

31:28.805 --> 31:31.141
That's what couples do.
They spend time together.

31:31.182 --> 31:34.269
- Yeah, but not every moment
of every day.

31:34.310 --> 31:36.604
- Did she say something to you?

31:36.646 --> 31:37.939
(Phone chimes)

31:41.234 --> 31:42.902
- (Chuckles) What a loser!

31:42.944 --> 31:45.530
- Who?
- Clay. Look at this picture
he just sent me.

31:45.572 --> 31:47.365
Since when is he into archery?

31:50.660 --> 31:52.954
- Archery?

32:02.714 --> 32:10.722
**

32:10.764 --> 32:11.973
(Phone beeps on)

32:14.225 --> 32:17.145
(Whooshing game sound effect
on computer)

32:17.187 --> 32:19.272
(Cell phone rings)

32:24.486 --> 32:26.654
(Phone beeps)
(Ringing stops)

32:30.533 --> 32:32.994
(Phone clicks off)

32:35.789 --> 32:37.290
(Computer rings)

32:45.632 --> 32:46.716
(Computer beeps)

32:46.758 --> 32:47.842
- Ty!

32:47.884 --> 32:49.761
- I hope I didn't wake ya.

32:49.803 --> 32:51.262
- It's so good to hear
your voice.

32:51.304 --> 32:52.597
I've missed you so much.

32:52.639 --> 32:54.849
Ty: I miss you too.
I woulda called sooner

32:54.891 --> 32:56.393
it's just, we're in the middle
of nowhere

32:56.434 --> 32:58.019
and it took forever
to get here.

32:58.061 --> 33:00.939
- That's okay. I'm just glad
you got there safely.

33:00.980 --> 33:03.066
Ty: I think you'd love
Mongolia, Amy.

33:03.108 --> 33:04.901
- What's it like?
Ty: Well, I haven't seen
much of it,

33:04.943 --> 33:08.321
but from what I have seen
it's pretty cool.

33:08.363 --> 33:10.740
There's horses everywhere
and Bob and I are actually

33:10.782 --> 33:13.284
going out tomorrow to examine
some of the local livestock.

33:13.326 --> 33:15.120
- That sounds amazing.

33:15.161 --> 33:16.705
- How's our little nugget doing?

33:16.746 --> 33:18.748
- Good. Really good.

33:18.790 --> 33:20.500
- I have a doctor's appointment
coming up.

33:20.542 --> 33:21.793
It's the one where
we get to find out

33:21.835 --> 33:24.254
if it's a boy or a girl.

33:24.295 --> 33:26.381
Ty?

33:26.423 --> 33:28.049
Ty: No, it's just uh...

33:28.091 --> 33:30.677
I just, I really wanted
to be there for that but...

33:30.719 --> 33:34.681
- Don't worry. I promise I won't
find out anything without you.

33:36.725 --> 33:38.810
So what are they feeding
you over there?

33:38.852 --> 33:40.729
Ty: If you can believe it: goat.

33:40.770 --> 33:42.439
- Did you say goat?
Ty: Yeah.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.691
We had goat stew for dinner.

33:44.733 --> 33:47.402
- Well, it was probably better
than the stew we had.

33:47.444 --> 33:48.945
(Chuckles)

33:48.987 --> 33:50.947
Ty: Just hold on. I'm gonna take
you on a tour of the camp, okay?

33:50.989 --> 33:53.575
- Okay.
Ty: So this is my yurt.

33:53.616 --> 33:55.744
It's pretty simple, but check
out the design on the door.

33:55.785 --> 33:58.079
- (Laughs)
Ty: Beautiful, huh?

33:59.873 --> 34:01.082
(Birds chirp)

34:04.711 --> 34:06.087
(Gate clanks)

34:07.881 --> 34:09.757
(Hooves thud)

34:11.342 --> 34:13.344
Norah: At it already I see.

34:13.386 --> 34:14.721
- We're not giving up
that easily.

34:14.763 --> 34:16.097
Hoo, are we, boy?

34:18.308 --> 34:20.935
Who's this?
- This is my son, Milo.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.646
Amy: Hi, Milo! (Chuckles)

34:23.688 --> 34:25.690
- I hope it's okay.
I couldn't find a babysitter

34:25.732 --> 34:28.818
so I brought him along.
- Of course. He's adorable!

34:28.860 --> 34:30.235
(Milo cries)

34:31.362 --> 34:32.655
(Doc snorts)

34:32.697 --> 34:34.657
Norah: It's okay, Milo,
it's okay.

34:34.699 --> 34:35.574
(Doc snorts angrily)

34:35.617 --> 34:37.534
- Hey, easy.
(Doc snorts angrily)

34:37.577 --> 34:38.411
Hey, whoa, what, what?

34:38.453 --> 34:40.580
- Shh, shh, shh.
(Milo quiets down)

34:41.915 --> 34:43.458
- I think I understand.

34:46.378 --> 34:48.420
Doc's jealous.

34:48.463 --> 34:50.340
- No offense, but that
sounds crazy.

34:50.382 --> 34:52.342
- There's nothing crazy
about it.

34:52.384 --> 34:55.053
Before Milo was born,
Doc was your baby.

34:55.094 --> 34:58.556
I bet you used to spend
hours a day with him,

34:58.598 --> 35:00.725
and then as soon
as your son was born

35:00.767 --> 35:02.394
he got all the attention.

35:02.435 --> 35:05.063
Doc's jealous.

35:05.105 --> 35:07.941
- I have been distracted lately.

35:07.982 --> 35:09.526
My husband's been looking
after him.

35:09.567 --> 35:11.695
I haven't had time.

35:11.736 --> 35:14.823
- I get it. A new baby needs
his mom's attention,

35:14.864 --> 35:18.451
but so does your other baby.
(Light pats)

35:18.493 --> 35:20.328
- Do you mind?
- Of course not.

35:21.705 --> 35:23.164
Hi. Hey, you.

35:24.332 --> 35:26.001
Want to go over here? Huh?

35:26.042 --> 35:27.293
- (Sighs)

35:28.586 --> 35:30.797
Hey boy. Can you forgive me?

35:32.424 --> 35:33.466
(Milo fusses)

35:34.801 --> 35:36.886
So what do we do now?

35:36.928 --> 35:38.847
- We go back to the basics.

35:43.018 --> 35:45.645
- Look.
- I think he likes me.

35:45.687 --> 35:46.896
Norah: Yeah!
- (Chuckles)

35:46.938 --> 35:48.440
Hey.

35:57.657 --> 35:59.576
- Okay, what are we painting
today?

35:59.617 --> 36:01.786
- Remi!
- Oh, you sure are!

36:01.828 --> 36:03.538
And look, she's posing for you!

36:03.580 --> 36:06.958
Do you have all the colors
you need?
- Yup.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.209
- What is that?

36:09.419 --> 36:11.379
Katie, you have gg's jar!

36:14.174 --> 36:15.467
(Laughing) Oh, ho ho ho ho ho!

36:15.508 --> 36:17.761
(Laughs)

36:17.802 --> 36:18.887
Well...

36:21.931 --> 36:23.892
- Yeah. There's a good boy.

36:25.935 --> 36:28.396
You like that, don't you?

36:28.438 --> 36:31.107
- So, Milo's in good hands.

36:31.149 --> 36:32.734
I just met your husband
out there.

36:32.776 --> 36:34.444
Norah: Ah, you know, I...

36:34.486 --> 36:37.238
I told him I needed to spend
more time with Doc.

36:38.865 --> 36:41.910
It's weird, I...
I love being a mom,

36:41.951 --> 36:46.956
but I don't want to forget
who I was before having Milo.

36:46.998 --> 36:49.167
- I've been thinking about that
a lot too lately,

36:49.209 --> 36:51.503
how things are going to change.

36:51.544 --> 36:53.171
- Not everything changes.

36:53.213 --> 36:56.007
I'm still the same girl
I always was,

36:56.049 --> 36:57.967
and mounted archery's
a huge part of that.

36:58.009 --> 36:59.594
Doc is a huge part of that.

37:05.975 --> 37:06.893
(Truck rumbles)

37:06.935 --> 37:08.561
- Good boy.

37:10.146 --> 37:12.440
(Door opens and closes)

37:12.482 --> 37:14.275
Good boy.
(Light pats)

37:16.111 --> 37:17.195
You're back.

37:17.237 --> 37:19.989
Yeah, just dropping off
some of Tim's stuff.

37:20.031 --> 37:21.825
What are you doing
to that horse?

37:21.866 --> 37:24.327
- I'm getting Phoenix used
to the archery equipment.

37:24.369 --> 37:26.830
Norah: Good work, Georgie.
He doesn't look scared at all.

37:26.871 --> 37:28.832
- I would be if I were him.

37:28.873 --> 37:31.710
Amy: Do you guys want to see
how a professional does it?

37:31.751 --> 37:33.003
- What, you think we're ready?

37:33.044 --> 37:35.171
Amy: I really think you are.

37:35.213 --> 37:37.799
- Okay, let's do it.
(Gate clanks)

37:40.593 --> 37:42.887

37:42.929 --> 37:43.555

(Clapping)
- (Happy laugh)

38:06.453 --> 38:08.163
- Wow!

38:08.204 --> 38:09.873
Good boy!
(Affectionate pats)

38:09.914 --> 38:11.750
That's the horse I remember!

38:11.791 --> 38:13.084
- Norah, you're amazing!

38:13.126 --> 38:15.045
- I have never seen anything
like that.

38:15.086 --> 38:17.005
- Well, now we just have to get
our time down.

38:17.047 --> 38:19.966
If you can't do the course
in under 16 seconds

38:20.008 --> 38:21.676
you're kinda out
of the contest.

38:21.718 --> 38:23.553
Clay: 16 seconds?!

38:23.595 --> 38:25.930
Huh, you got some work to do.

38:25.972 --> 38:27.349
(Bike clicks)

38:28.433 --> 38:30.769
- Adam, hey!

38:30.810 --> 38:33.813
- Looks like you two
are having fun.

38:33.855 --> 38:35.565
- I thought you would be
at the Science Centre.

38:35.607 --> 38:37.776
- And I thought you wanted
space.

38:37.817 --> 38:39.277
I didn't think that meant
ditching me

38:39.319 --> 38:41.112
to hang out with him
for the whole weekend.

38:41.154 --> 38:44.074
- I didn't. Just I...
- Whatever.

38:44.115 --> 38:46.951
I hope you two are very happy
together.

38:46.993 --> 38:49.371
Clay: Okay.
(Bike clicks)

38:55.960 --> 38:58.922
- Well, I could try that
I guess.

38:58.963 --> 39:00.048
Lisa: (Clears throat)

39:00.090 --> 39:01.299
We have something for you.

39:01.341 --> 39:03.468
- It's not more measuring cups,
is it?

39:03.510 --> 39:04.969
- No, it's not.

39:07.889 --> 39:09.849
Mmm hmm.
- My jar! Where did you get
that?!

39:09.891 --> 39:12.686
- Funny story. So, yes,
I did try to recycle it,

39:12.727 --> 39:16.064
but Katie found it and used it
for her paint brushes.

39:16.106 --> 39:18.066
- Your paint brushes?

39:18.108 --> 39:19.567
Well, can I have it back?

39:19.609 --> 39:21.695
- Mmm hmm.
- Thank you, honey.

39:21.736 --> 39:22.904
- You're welcome.

39:26.032 --> 39:27.659
(Birds chirp)

39:34.708 --> 39:36.584
(Footsteps crunch)

39:40.714 --> 39:42.924
- You should get one.

39:42.966 --> 39:45.010
- A horse?

39:45.051 --> 39:47.053
- Yeah, a horse.

39:47.095 --> 39:49.681
What woman lives on a ranch
doesn't own her own horse?

39:49.723 --> 39:51.599
- A busy one.

39:55.145 --> 39:58.106
- Look, Lou, I think I owe
you an apologize for yesterday.

40:00.358 --> 40:02.318
The reason that I was
so anti-social was--

40:02.360 --> 40:04.696
- Look, I get it, okay?
Enough said.

40:06.114 --> 40:08.241
I was the one who made
the wrong move.

40:08.283 --> 40:09.909
You don't have to say
anything more.

40:09.951 --> 40:12.328
- No, you don't understand...
- No, I do understand.

40:12.370 --> 40:14.956
You obviously need to be
alone right now,

40:14.998 --> 40:17.125
and I'm just the girl
to make that happen.

40:22.839 --> 40:25.675
- Adam! I've been looking
everywhere for you!

40:25.717 --> 40:26.718
- What do you want?

40:26.760 --> 40:28.428
- I didn't ditch you to hang
out with Clay.

40:28.470 --> 40:30.764
I didn't even know he was gonna
be at Heartland!

40:30.805 --> 40:32.140
He wasn't invited!
He just showed up!

40:32.182 --> 40:33.850
And in case you were wondering,

40:33.892 --> 40:36.311
all he wanted to do
was talk about Jade.

40:36.353 --> 40:38.396
I love hanging out with you,
just not all the time.

40:38.438 --> 40:39.814
Sometimes I want to do
my own thing

40:39.856 --> 40:41.066
and I'm sure you do too!

40:41.107 --> 40:43.109
Look, hey, I miss you, a lot,

40:44.569 --> 40:48.406
and I'll, I'll go the Science
Centre exhibit if you want to.

40:48.448 --> 40:50.992
- Nah, I don't want
to smother you.

40:57.082 --> 40:59.167
Norah: I can't thank
you enough, Amy.

40:59.209 --> 41:01.002
Your reputation doesn't do
you justice.

41:01.044 --> 41:02.295
You're amazing.

41:02.337 --> 41:04.714
- I need to thank you, too.
- What for?

41:04.756 --> 41:07.258
- You and Doc made me realize
something.

41:07.300 --> 41:10.053
I have to work at keeping the
connection with my own horse.

41:10.095 --> 41:12.222
He's been agitated lately
and now I realize

41:12.263 --> 41:14.265
that I haven't been giving
him enough attention.

41:14.307 --> 41:17.310
He's already taken a backseat
to the baby.

41:17.352 --> 41:20.438
- Pregnancy's tough.
I'm not gonna lie,

41:20.480 --> 41:22.524
but it's all worth it
in the end.

41:23.983 --> 41:26.194
- You take care.
Norah: You too.
(Truck starts up)

41:31.282 --> 41:34.953

you carry me away *

* And I will throw all of these
words I have to say *

41:55.348 --> 41:57.183
* And I broke my heart in two *

41:58.393 --> 42:00.562
* One for me and one for you *

42:02.480 --> 42:04.733
* And I broke my heart in two *

42:05.900 --> 42:07.902
* One for me and one for you *

42:09.988 --> 42:12.991

42:31.843 --> 42:34.179

42:39.184 --> 42:41.269
* Came over me *

42:42.854 --> 42:44.606
* Like fire, like blood, *

42:46.941 --> 42:48.860
* Like sunlight oh oh... *

42:48.902 --> 42:50.904
(Hard thwack)

42:50.945 --> 42:52.113
* Oh oh oh oh *

42:54.783 --> 42:57.285
* Oh oh oh oh *

42:59.037 --> 43:01.498
- Good boy!

43:01.539 --> 43:04.918
* And I broke my heart in two *

43:04.959 --> 43:07.712
* One for me and one for you *

43:09.089 --> 43:11.049
* And I broke my heart in two *

43:12.258 --> 43:14.052
* One for me and one for you *

43:16.137 --> 43:18.139
* And I broke my heart in two *

43:19.808 --> 43:22.143
* One for me and one for you *

43:23.603 --> 43:25.897
* And I broke my heart in two *

43:27.065 --> 43:29.734
* One for me and one for you *
