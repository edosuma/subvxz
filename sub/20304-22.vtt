00:01.209 --> 00:03.753
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:03.837 --> 00:05.547
You're gettin' old real fast.

00:05.630 --> 00:09.175
You're gonna make it.
You're in your 53rd hour.

00:09.259 --> 00:12.095
We want you to call Rollie Simone, Mo.
Want you to sell him your paper.

00:12.178 --> 00:14.597
I'm not settin' up Rollie Simone
for no police action.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.725
I don't know how Mo
could let things get this far.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.309
Mr. Simone, the last payment--

00:18.393 --> 00:20.520
Neal, let's do both of us a favor,
and you keep your mouth shut.

00:20.603 --> 00:23.732
Suddenly, it was all clear to me,
and I want this baby.

00:23.815 --> 00:25.150
You owe me.

00:26.651 --> 00:30.488
The grant proposal you submitted
was for a local youth recreation program.

00:30.572 --> 00:34.409
What's 50 lousy Gs
worth of basketball and high-tops?

00:34.909 --> 00:36.411
Don't do it, man!

00:36.870 --> 00:38.038
I'll kill you!

00:38.747 --> 00:41.291
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight, on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:41.374 --> 00:44.169
I heard they got this
typing class down at Metro JC.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.587
Rico, that's terrific.

00:45.670 --> 00:48.506
That satchel had over 50,000 bucks in it.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.425
What exactly was your destination?

00:50.508 --> 00:52.135
The Hill Street precinct station.

00:52.218 --> 00:55.722
-Oh, no! No!
-You mean the payroll?

00:55.805 --> 00:56.973
You know, I feel awkward

00:57.057 --> 00:59.434
not being able to bankroll
any of this, Counselor.

01:00.643 --> 01:04.773
I'll let you make it up to me
in some mindlessly extravagant way.

01:04.856 --> 01:07.859
Would you and Joe be free this evening?

01:09.277 --> 01:10.612
I think that could be arranged.

01:10.695 --> 01:12.030
It's a girl, Frank.

01:12.113 --> 01:16.367
The amniocentesis,
she's a perfectly healthy baby girl.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.328
Was I a disappointment to you, Furillo?

01:18.411 --> 01:19.579
Well, let me tell you something--

01:19.662 --> 01:21.414
I don't live for your approval.

01:21.498 --> 01:22.582
You done, Simone, huh?

01:22.665 --> 01:24.834
How's that manicotti?
Do you like that, huh?

01:24.918 --> 01:26.961
How about a little red with that?

01:28.963 --> 01:30.131
(indistinct chattering)

01:30.215 --> 01:34.969
Item 11, another corpus delicti,

01:35.053 --> 01:38.932
the mortal remains of local shylock
Mo "the Mouse" Feldstein

01:39.015 --> 01:41.935
were discovered during the wee hours
of the night shift.

01:42.018 --> 01:45.730
Ã€ la Buddy Jannette,
Mo was minus one right hand,

01:45.814 --> 01:48.650
the forefinger of which, upon discovery,

01:48.733 --> 01:52.320
will presumably be pointing
in the general direction

01:52.403 --> 01:54.989
of Mr. Roland Simone.

01:55.073 --> 01:58.785
Item 12, Detective Neal Washington

01:58.868 --> 02:02.831
remains in post-op
at Mercy Hospital this morning.

02:03.456 --> 02:06.835
An undercover transaction
with the aforementioned Roland Simone

02:06.918 --> 02:08.378
went sour last night.

02:08.461 --> 02:14.134
A suitcase with roughly $400,000
worth of street-value cocaine

02:14.217 --> 02:15.301
was appropriated.

02:15.385 --> 02:18.263
Detective Washington
taking the bullet in the process,

02:18.346 --> 02:22.934
resulting in a fractured collarbone
and associated minor trauma

02:23.017 --> 02:27.063
from which he's expected to make
a complete and rapid recovery.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.774
-(cheers)
-Hastened, one would hope,

02:29.858 --> 02:33.862
by the cards and flowers of his cohorts.

02:33.945 --> 02:37.740
Now, all donations to which
should be referenced to Detective LaRue

02:37.824 --> 02:40.034
following this A.M.'s dispatch.

02:40.118 --> 02:43.121
Bringing me to our last item, people,

02:43.204 --> 02:46.291
another riveting update
from the city budget office.

02:46.749 --> 02:50.295
"With our sincerest apologies

02:50.753 --> 02:54.340
for all concomitant
and pay-related inconveniences,

02:54.424 --> 02:57.093
this office is pleased to announce

02:57.177 --> 03:01.306
the summary withdrawal
of Councilman Langella's filibuster,

03:01.890 --> 03:04.058
thereby accessing full approval

03:04.142 --> 03:08.188
of the current metropolitan
fiscal expenditure outline."

03:08.271 --> 03:09.939
-Now, for those of you...
-(Renko indistinct)

03:10.023 --> 03:12.775
...whom bureaucrat-ese
is not a second language,

03:12.859 --> 03:15.320
the above loosely translates as,

03:15.403 --> 03:17.906
"Don't spend it all in one place."

03:17.989 --> 03:19.032
(cheering)

03:19.115 --> 03:20.325
Hey!

03:20.408 --> 03:21.910
Our back pay will be arriving
by special courier

03:21.993 --> 03:24.787
before the morning's out in cash.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.999
(cheering)

03:33.546 --> 03:35.548
Hey, hey, hey!

03:37.634 --> 03:39.469
Let's be careful out there.

03:47.018 --> 03:51.189
A little happy-hour action at Cole's,
dinner for two at the Cloister,

03:51.564 --> 03:53.608
a 20-buck bottle of wine.

03:53.691 --> 03:55.526
Ooh, finally something
with a cork in it, huh?

03:55.610 --> 03:58.112
-What about you, Bob?
-Restock the fridge, pay the rent.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.656
Real Hugh Hefner, huh?

04:00.406 --> 04:01.366
Hey, Leo.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.702
Rico. Hey, Rico,
let me take a look at you.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.330
-Hey, so how do I look?
-You look good.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.749
Great. Yeah, I had some stomach cramps
this morning,

04:09.832 --> 04:11.626
but my sister made me some soup.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.295
-But now you feel okay?
-Oh, yeah.

04:14.379 --> 04:17.757
Hey, every day and every way,
I'm gettin' better and better.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.635
Say, Leo, you think you could spare me off
cop-tips this morning?

04:20.718 --> 04:21.636
Why? What's up?

04:22.512 --> 04:25.890
Well, I heard they got this typing class
down at Metro JC,

04:25.974 --> 04:27.600
you know, real career stuff.

04:27.684 --> 04:28.685
It costs 12 bucks.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.103
Rico, that's terrific.

04:30.186 --> 04:32.313
Sure, we'll put the cop-tips
on tape recorder.

04:32.397 --> 04:36.109
Hey, great.
It costs 12 bucks, and so far I got seven.

04:36.192 --> 04:37.819
So far, you got 12.

04:38.861 --> 04:40.738
Oh, hey, hey, Leo, I don't know--

04:40.822 --> 04:42.573
I consider this an investment.

04:44.075 --> 04:46.244
(stammering)
You've been like a mother to me.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.871
So you'll take care of me in my old age.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.123
What's the deal here?

04:50.790 --> 04:53.167
Hey, Rico, you're gonna make it, pal.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.004
Yeah, maybe I will.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.840
Maybe I will.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.847
That's an awesome
reclamation effort, James.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.598
Fine thing you do, Leo.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.226
Yeah,
<i>"Other Side of the Mountain, part VI."</i>

05:10.643 --> 05:12.145
Hey! Hey, Benedetto!

05:12.687 --> 05:13.938
Oh, what a stroke, huh?

05:14.022 --> 05:16.149
You set up a big meetin'
then get rid of all your backups.

05:16.232 --> 05:17.066
Why didn't I think of that?

05:17.150 --> 05:18.818
That's not the way it was, LaRue.

05:18.901 --> 05:20.528
Hey, man, it was tactical genius.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.655
-You must've really thrown--
-Shove it, cupcake!

05:22.739 --> 05:24.407
I feel just as bad as anybody!

05:24.490 --> 05:27.910
You almost got my partner killed,
you fat greaseball!

05:27.994 --> 05:29.912
We got a date, Sal!
You put it on your calendar!

05:29.996 --> 05:32.832
WOMAN (over radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:32.915 --> 05:34.625
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:34.709 --> 05:38.463
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:38.546 --> 05:40.173
(sirens wailing)

05:45.845 --> 05:49.557
(theme music playing)

06:55.665 --> 06:58.418
First thing I'm gonna do, Bobby,
I'm gonna take my cash money

06:58.501 --> 07:00.670
down to a place of public entertainment,

07:01.045 --> 07:05.007
-spend it freely and at an alarming rate.
-(laughing)

07:05.091 --> 07:09.137
Sweep the finest and foxiest lassie
on the premises off her feet

07:09.220 --> 07:12.557
with some grandiose demonstration
of my personal generosity.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.766
Mm-hmm.

07:13.850 --> 07:17.562
Repair to the privacy
of her boudoir or mine,

07:18.187 --> 07:22.024
and for the next 48 hours,
spend it on the brink

07:22.108 --> 07:27.447
of some hitherto uncharted plateau
of physical expression.

07:28.739 --> 07:32.827
Well, now, I think I'm gonna start off
with about 15 bags of groceries.

07:32.910 --> 07:35.163
Renko, I feel like
I haven't eaten for a month.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.915
That only goes to show you the difference
between you and me, my friend.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.668
-Yeah, the naked and the fed.
-(laughs)

07:40.751 --> 07:42.295
DISPATCH (over radio):
<i>All units, 211, corner...</i>

07:42.378 --> 07:44.005
Uh-oh. That's for us.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.009
Two-two-oh-two will respond.

07:48.092 --> 07:50.052
(siren wailing)

07:55.975 --> 07:58.519
-You gotta help me. Please.
-All right, just calm down now. Come on.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.605
Stand over here against the car
and tell us what happened.

08:00.688 --> 08:01.856
There were two of them.

08:01.939 --> 08:04.150
They hit me when I was coming out.
I didn't even see 'em.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.234
Sir, take it easy, please.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.819
Now, what was the nature
of your complaint, sir?

08:06.903 --> 08:09.280
I was just getting a doughnut.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.074
I mean, they must've known
I was making this run.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.285
They should've never given me cash.

08:14.368 --> 08:16.412
Did they assault you
when you got back in the car?

08:16.496 --> 08:17.788
They must've been waiting for me.

08:17.872 --> 08:21.334
That satchel had over 50,000 bucks in it.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.544
I'm gonna be killed for this.

08:24.045 --> 08:28.257
No, now, I wouldn't say that, sir.
This sort of thing happens all the time.

08:28.341 --> 08:31.302
Now, calm down.
What exactly was your destination?

08:32.345 --> 08:34.222
The Hill Street precinct station.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.057
The Hill Street station?

08:36.140 --> 08:38.142
No, no, there must be some mistake, sir.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.894
You see, that was our destination.

08:41.646 --> 08:44.315
-There's no mistake.
-Oh, no! No!

08:44.899 --> 08:46.150
You mean the payroll?

08:47.026 --> 08:50.071
You mean you gave it to them
just like that, you little bug?

08:50.780 --> 08:54.158
I oughta take your head and crush it
in between my hands like a grape.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.743
Do you have any idea what you've done?

08:55.826 --> 08:58.204
You are a miserable excuse
for a human being!

08:58.287 --> 09:00.581
Please! I already got hit once! I'm sorry!

09:00.665 --> 09:02.250
Renko, there's nothin' we can do about it!

09:02.333 --> 09:04.877
Oh, Lord, I am nothing.

09:05.753 --> 09:06.963
I have no money.

09:07.380 --> 09:11.509
I might as well just go lie down
on the street and die.

09:19.850 --> 09:21.310
Benedetto, in here, please.

09:24.855 --> 09:28.025
-Good morning, Frank. Excuse us, please.
-Chief. Sal.

09:28.359 --> 09:31.028
Know what I found next to my coffee
this morning, Frank?

09:31.779 --> 09:34.490
Know what this is? It's a minefield.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.534
Column one...

09:37.076 --> 09:39.829
"Another loan shark
piecemealed on the Hill."

09:40.663 --> 09:41.998
Column three...

09:42.081 --> 09:44.458
"A detective wounded
and a suitcase of narcotics

09:44.542 --> 09:47.795
from the Midtown property room
taken off in a botched operation."

09:48.170 --> 09:49.380
Over here...

09:49.463 --> 09:53.301
"A leak from the medical examiner's office
on a John Doe name of Sonny Crockett

09:53.384 --> 09:56.429
held over 48 hours
without releasing identification."

09:56.512 --> 09:57.513
Small detail.

09:57.805 --> 09:59.473
It happens to be illegal.

09:59.557 --> 10:04.520
Not to mention installments 15 and 16
in the continuing saga of Buddy Janette.

10:04.895 --> 10:07.189
Now, you tell me, Frank,
what do we do about it?

10:07.273 --> 10:10.151
Excuse me, Chief, if I might
inject a little scenario here.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.988
(clears throat)
Mo sells his paper to Simone, okay?

10:14.488 --> 10:17.450
The mouse seems a little anxious.
Maybe Rollie's thinking.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.577
A couple days later, Rollie picks up

10:19.660 --> 10:22.788
we're holding Mo's leg-breaker
in the morgue on a John Doe.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.291
He figures maybe the mouse
is rollin' over.

10:25.374 --> 10:28.252
(chuckles)
He'd be right. Rollie whacks him.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.796
Now, if the mouse gave him
Washington, a cop,

10:30.880 --> 10:32.798
Rollie sets up a meet for the powder.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.593
Hm, now, all he's gotta do
is put out the word.

10:35.676 --> 10:38.763
Ten to one, we got taken off
by a couple of hot-dog freelancers,

10:38.846 --> 10:42.224
and Simone's already traded for the soda
in a separate transaction.

10:43.559 --> 10:44.602
(laughing)

10:44.685 --> 10:46.562
Frank, what the hell is he babbling about?

10:47.313 --> 10:49.649
I think he means
that Roland Simone is responsible

10:49.732 --> 10:51.484
for a good half of that front page.

10:51.567 --> 10:52.735
And what do you think?

10:53.361 --> 10:54.779
I'm not disagreeing.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.947
Ask me? We got enough on Simone

10:57.031 --> 10:59.408
to put him away for conspiracy
right now, Chief.

11:00.701 --> 11:03.245
Then what are we waiting for?
Let's bring him in, Frank. Let's do it.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.122
Are we minimizing our chances

11:05.206 --> 11:07.375
of getting him on attempted murder
of Neal Washington?

11:07.833 --> 11:09.752
A bird in the hand is priority one.

11:09.835 --> 11:13.255
Priority two is a full-bore offensive
on these other charges.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.633
Run down every lead
you've got on Feldstein, Janette,

11:15.716 --> 11:17.051
and the Washington shooting.

11:17.593 --> 11:20.554
Pull out the stops.
Put double shifts on the phones.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.557
We'll nail that slime
with whatever sticks.

11:24.934 --> 11:28.688
I'm releasing a statement at 2:00
that Simone's been brought in.

11:30.022 --> 11:33.776
You better move fast, Frank,
if you want to make the five o'clock news.

11:37.154 --> 11:40.408
I want two uniforms along for the ride.
Coordinate with Esterhaus.

11:45.496 --> 11:48.082
I never had a partner hit before, Captain.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.377
I want this chump as bad as you do.

11:53.337 --> 11:55.548
No problems. You got my word.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.301
(door closes)

12:04.432 --> 12:06.976
Fascinating story
in the morning paper here, Frank.

12:07.935 --> 12:10.521
About an ex-client of mine
name of Sonny Crockett

12:10.604 --> 12:13.441
being stashed persona non persona

12:13.524 --> 12:15.568
in the county morgue
for the past two days.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.445
Yes, that is fascinating.

12:17.528 --> 12:20.030
Not that I was planning
a memorial fund-raiser, Frank,

12:20.114 --> 12:22.158
but any reason why I wasn't informed?

12:22.324 --> 12:25.661
The continuing investigation
of his former employer, Mo Feldstein.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.455
You'll find that story in column one.

12:28.038 --> 12:29.790
You're pretty good at keeping secrets.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.377
Since I'm no longer bound
by client privilege,

12:33.461 --> 12:35.045
I'll let you in on one of my mine.

12:35.546 --> 12:37.673
Right before Joe Coffey's
grand-jury hearing,

12:37.757 --> 12:40.718
I had a confession from Crockett
in the Lynn Tatum homicide.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.262
Coffey might like to know
he's off the hook.

12:43.345 --> 12:44.513
Why don't you go tell him?

12:45.222 --> 12:46.098
Fair enough.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.727
I, uh, thought we might have lunch today.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.729
-You're on.
-How's noon?

12:52.062 --> 12:53.773
I'll make a reservation at The Galley.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.442
I was thinking more about room service.

12:59.528 --> 13:03.282
I hope you understand why I couldn't
reveal Crockett's confession until now.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.369
Now, this means I'm totally cleared
in the Tatum death, right?

13:07.453 --> 13:10.790
No civil liabilities,
no asterisk next to my name?

13:10.873 --> 13:12.374
I mean, it's over, right?

13:13.334 --> 13:16.629
I'll notify the DA's office
and Mrs. Tatum's attorneys

13:16.712 --> 13:17.713
within the hour.

13:18.422 --> 13:20.633
Miss Davenport, I mean, you don't know...

13:21.342 --> 13:23.886
-Thank you. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.973
What do you know?
The system works after all.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.767
Just like that, like it never happened.

13:29.850 --> 13:32.269
Hey, Coffey, Bates, we're outta here!

13:36.273 --> 13:38.526
I don't know what's wrong
with people nowadays, ma'am.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.569
I mean,
I was just trying to do her a favor.

13:42.530 --> 13:45.449
Mr. Dulcimer, I fail to see
how taking a woman's purse

13:45.533 --> 13:47.117
qualifies as an act of charity.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.578
I was trying to return it to her.
Don't you see?

13:49.662 --> 13:52.289
She left it on the bus seat.
She was headed out the front exit,

13:52.373 --> 13:54.166
so I grabbed it. I ran after her.

13:54.959 --> 13:58.128
According to Mrs. Jenkins and the driver,
you ran in the wrong direction.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.047
No, that's not true.

14:00.130 --> 14:01.632
I went out the back door

14:01.715 --> 14:04.093
only 'cause I was afraid the bus
was gonna take off again.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.512
I figured I would catch up
with her on the street.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.474
Your arrest report
paints a slightly different picture.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.727
That's 'cause the minute
I stepped off the bus,

14:13.811 --> 14:15.855
this lady started screaming bloody murder.

14:15.938 --> 14:19.316
And before I could explain to her,
the policeman came along...

14:21.610 --> 14:23.445
(sighs)

14:24.905 --> 14:26.949
I don't know what else to tell you, ma'am.

14:27.575 --> 14:30.786
I've never been arrested
for anything in my entire life.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.497
It's true you have
no outstanding warrants.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.416
As an out-of-state resident,

14:35.499 --> 14:38.419
there's a good chance any priors
wouldn't show up yet anyway.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.838
There aren't any priors, Miss Davenport.

14:42.840 --> 14:46.802
I may be new to the city, ma'am,
but I never thought that it was a crime

14:46.886 --> 14:48.262
to try to help your neighbor.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.851
Your court date's set for two o'clock,
Mr. Dulcimer.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.605
If I can persuade the ADA,

14:57.688 --> 15:00.065
would you be willing
to accept a plea bargain?

15:00.149 --> 15:02.026
I'm sorry. I'm kind of new to this.

15:03.402 --> 15:06.405
You enter a guilty plea
in exchange for a lesser charge,

15:06.488 --> 15:08.449
say, disorderly conduct.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.618
I'm not-- I'm not trying to be
difficult with you, ma'am.

15:10.701 --> 15:13.078
It-it just strikes me as somehow wrong

15:13.162 --> 15:15.497
for me to have to apologize
for being innocent.

15:15.998 --> 15:20.210
You probably get a lot of bad apples
in your line of work, Miss Davenport,

15:20.294 --> 15:21.587
but I'd really appreciate it

15:21.670 --> 15:24.340
if you could at least
try to see it my way.

15:24.465 --> 15:25.966
(soft chuckle)

15:30.095 --> 15:31.138
Okay, Leonard,

15:32.348 --> 15:34.475
what do you say we
run through it one more time?

15:35.059 --> 15:37.353
(indistinct chattering)

15:47.488 --> 15:48.739
The guy's standing there.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.200
SIMONE: Ask him what he wants.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.412
He's got a badge.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.539
Cheese it, Arnie. It's the cops.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.209
-(chuckling)
-Let's go, Rollie.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.462
-I'm eating.
-When he's finished.

16:03.879 --> 16:06.840
Oh, he wants to finish?
Hey, I can understand that.

16:07.341 --> 16:10.219
Looks pretty good.
Let's see what you got there, huh?

16:11.053 --> 16:14.223
Lunch already.
Ooh, you must've been up pretty early.

16:14.598 --> 16:17.601
Some manicotti,
a little calamari, some marinara.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.770
Ooh, just like mama used to make, huh.

16:19.853 --> 16:21.188
You got an appointment?

16:21.271 --> 16:23.023
We don't have to have
a problem here, do we?

16:23.107 --> 16:25.401
No, not at all, Rollie.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.946
Only maybe you could eat
a little faster, huh?

16:29.029 --> 16:31.657
There you go! You done, huh?
You done, Simone, huh?!

16:31.740 --> 16:33.909
How's that manicotti? You like that, huh?

16:33.993 --> 16:35.536
How about a little red with that?

16:36.286 --> 16:39.540
I got to tell you something, Rollie,
for a man of your reputation,

16:39.623 --> 16:42.376
-your table manners are rotten!
-JOE: You got him, Sal!

16:42.668 --> 16:46.839
(chuckles) Come on.

16:54.805 --> 16:57.474
WOMAN (over PA):
<i>Dr. Cutler, ICU stat.</i>

16:57.558 --> 17:01.145
-Hey, J.D.
-Hey, hey, sleeping beauty awakes.

17:01.729 --> 17:02.563
How you feelin'?

17:02.896 --> 17:06.191
I don't know.
Gonna have to take inventory.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.861
(chuckles)
Oh, hey, so it shouldn't be a total loss,

17:08.944 --> 17:10.571
we chipped in and got you something.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.990
Hey, that's nice.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.909
-Think you might open it for me?
-Oh, yeah, sure.

17:17.327 --> 17:20.664
Uh, man, I was just talking to the doctor.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.124
Yeah?

17:22.207 --> 17:23.625
Yeah, I wanted to get the straight skinny.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.044
What'd he say?

17:26.253 --> 17:28.672
Well, he said there's some
good news and some bad news.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.300
What's the bad news?

17:32.259 --> 17:36.013
-You're gonna die.
-(chuckles) That's a shame.

17:37.556 --> 17:40.225
Oh, yeah, but the good news
is it's gonna take another 50 years.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.143
Here you are.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.354
Aw, man, you shouldn't have.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.983
Well, you know, those hospital toothpicks,
they're the worst.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.026
Yeah.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.946
Mm. I feel better already.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.325
It scared the hell out of me, Neal,
almost losing you.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.910
I don't know what I'd do with myself.

17:57.993 --> 18:01.663
Partners, right?
Think I'd let you down like that?

18:02.247 --> 18:04.541
-Nah, I guess not.
-Damn right.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.629
(knock on door)

18:13.383 --> 18:15.761
You must have me pegged
for a real Phi Beta Kappa.

18:15.844 --> 18:18.889
What we have is you on tape
in separate conversations

18:18.972 --> 18:22.267
with Mo Feldstein and Neal Washington
arranging to buy that suitcase,

18:22.851 --> 18:24.937
time and place, amount agreed to.

18:25.020 --> 18:26.897
I'm as sad as you to hear about Mo.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.691
He was a dear friend.

18:30.067 --> 18:34.822
That transaction was taken down
and an officer was wounded.

18:35.405 --> 18:39.618
At that time, for your information,
I was at my sister's wedding anniversary.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.787
I got-- Give me the list.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.998
I got a list here of 50 people
who can tell you the same thing.

18:45.415 --> 18:48.043
And I'll also tell you, Captain,
why I was there,

18:48.127 --> 18:51.797
leaving aside how I feel about my sister
and that scum she's married to.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.508
All right.

18:57.427 --> 18:58.887
Maybe there was gonna be a meet.

18:58.971 --> 19:03.100
Maybe also I got a phone call
the day before telling me not to show.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.601
It's a setup.

19:05.018 --> 19:07.396
I'm walking in there
with my eyes wide open.

19:07.479 --> 19:08.564
FRANK: A call from whom?

19:09.982 --> 19:12.526
I don't know... a voice.

19:12.609 --> 19:13.569
Somebody knew my phone number.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.070
I tell you,
I get a call like that, I listen.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.864
You didn't recognize it?

19:18.574 --> 19:21.034
It was dark. I couldn't hear so good.

19:24.037 --> 19:27.040
You gotta worry about your man going down.
I can understand that.

19:29.334 --> 19:30.502
You want my advice?

19:32.379 --> 19:34.590
You start looking for the guy
who dropped that dime.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.508
Book him on conspiracy

19:37.134 --> 19:39.052
and suspicion of the murder
of Buddy Janette.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.888
Buddy Janette?
I told you everything I know.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.181
Is that a fact?

19:43.098 --> 19:45.976
What did you tell Neal Washington
about Buddy Janette, Rollie?

19:46.059 --> 19:47.102
Ring any bells?

19:47.186 --> 19:50.480
SIMONE (over recorder):
<i>Do you know the name Buddy Janette?</i>

19:51.106 --> 19:52.399
NEAL (over recorder): <i>Yeah.</i>

19:53.442 --> 19:55.986
SIMONE: <i>This is a terrible thing</i>
<i>which happened to this guy.</i>

19:56.612 --> 19:57.738
<i>You know something, Neal?</i>

19:58.614 --> 20:02.159
<i>He owed less than $28,000.</i>

20:10.918 --> 20:12.628
Frank, I got six units
on the payroll heist.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.046
-Any progress?
-Nothing solid.

20:14.129 --> 20:15.422
The courier gave us a description,

20:15.505 --> 20:18.884
white late-model van, three digits off
the plates. There's an APB out.

20:18.967 --> 20:19.801
What about suspects?

20:19.885 --> 20:22.095
I got him going over the books.
He didn't get a very good look.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.388
-Good. Stay with it.
-All right.

20:26.183 --> 20:29.770
-Frank!
-Oh, Fay, I'm just on my way out.

20:29.853 --> 20:31.104
It's a girl, Frank.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.023
The amniocentesis,

20:33.106 --> 20:36.610
it is a perfectly healthy,
beautiful baby girl.

20:36.693 --> 20:40.697
-Oh, that's wonderful. Congratulations.
-Oh, I did the right thing, Frank.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.449
I can't tell you how happy I am.

20:42.532 --> 20:45.953
-I'm happy for you.
-A girl, Frank. I mean, isn't it grand?

20:46.036 --> 20:47.955
I've been thinking about some names.

20:48.038 --> 20:51.375
Uh, Fay, could we talk
when I have a little more time?

20:51.458 --> 20:54.294
Sure. It's okay.
It's just I have so much to tell you.

20:54.378 --> 20:55.837
I'm sure you have. I'll call you.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.298
-Okay.
-Wonderful news.

20:58.382 --> 20:59.383
Yeah.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.053
ESTERHAUS: Fay...

21:08.016 --> 21:09.810
Gorgeous, Fay.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.562
She'll be the light of your life.

21:12.646 --> 21:16.316
They say she's perfect, Phil,
every precious inch of her.

21:16.400 --> 21:20.153
A little girl. I can just see her now.
A little angel.

21:20.237 --> 21:24.741
-Oh, how lucky you must feel.
-Well, I highly recommend it, Phil.

21:24.825 --> 21:27.744
-(scoffs)
-Come on. Why not? You oughta try it.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.413
Oh, how I wish.

21:30.289 --> 21:34.042
Come on, Phil. You know,
it's not out of the question.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.795
No, it's just a feeling, Fay.

21:37.421 --> 21:40.007
It just doesn't seem to be in the cards.

21:40.882 --> 21:42.592
You know what saddens me?

21:44.261 --> 21:50.100
I finally reached a place in my life
where I know with absolute conviction

21:50.726 --> 21:54.187
that I can be the kind
of father to a child

21:55.314 --> 21:57.065
that I've always wanted to be.

21:58.692 --> 22:01.153
You know, there are fathers
and then there are fathers.

22:01.945 --> 22:03.655
I mean, as it stands right now,

22:03.739 --> 22:06.408
my little girl's not gonna have
any kind of father at all.

22:07.951 --> 22:09.077
Fay...

22:09.161 --> 22:13.999
And, um, I'd consider it an honor
if you'd be her godfather.

22:15.625 --> 22:18.962
I mean, if you could be there for her
when she needs someone to look up to.

22:20.088 --> 22:23.925
'Cause I gotta tell you, honestly,
I can't think of another man in the world

22:24.801 --> 22:26.386
that I would prefer her looking up to

22:27.220 --> 22:29.389
than you, Philip Freemason Esterhaus.

22:31.141 --> 22:34.478
(sniffling)

22:34.561 --> 22:37.147
-I don't know what to say.
-Oh.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.401
Say yes.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.696
(sniffling) Yes.

22:46.448 --> 22:47.324
Good.

22:52.287 --> 22:55.832
You know, I feel awkward not being able
to bankroll any of this, Counselor.

22:56.958 --> 23:01.254
I'll let you make it up to me
in some mindlessly extravagant way.

23:01.338 --> 23:04.549
-Take a promissory note?
-I'll take anything you've got.

23:07.761 --> 23:09.304
(knocking on window)

23:09.388 --> 23:11.723
Window washer! Sorry!

23:19.439 --> 23:21.191
Meter's running, pizza man.

23:29.324 --> 23:31.159
(knocking on door)

23:37.833 --> 23:40.919
-What?
-(panting) I forgot your mineral water.

23:41.002 --> 23:43.380
-FRANK: Oh, fine.
-MAN: Thank you, sir.

23:43.463 --> 23:46.216
-(panting)
-Are you all right?

23:46.299 --> 23:49.261
Elevator's out. I took the stairs.

23:49.344 --> 23:51.346
-That was a mistake.
-Let me take this.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.431
Thank you, sir.

23:54.015 --> 23:56.184
I'll be all right.
It happens all the time.

23:56.268 --> 23:59.229
Oh. Here, appreciate it.

23:59.312 --> 24:00.147
Thank you, sir.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.482
Listen, maybe you should wait
till they fix the elevator.

24:02.566 --> 24:06.736
That's a very good idea.
Thank you. I will.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.078
-Is he all right?
-I think he'll live.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.084
(knocking on door)

24:26.339 --> 24:27.382
What?

24:27.466 --> 24:30.886
(panting) That was a big mistake.

24:31.178 --> 24:34.598
Oh. Oh. Oh.

24:35.182 --> 24:38.351
-I'll call the desk.
-Oh, no, no. I'll be all right.

24:38.435 --> 24:39.811
It happens all the time.

24:40.604 --> 24:43.398
Just-just need to catch my breath.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.192
Here...

24:48.570 --> 24:50.155
Okay, open up.

24:52.699 --> 24:53.992
What-what else can we do?

24:58.830 --> 25:00.624
Maybe a pillow under my feet.

25:05.378 --> 25:07.005
(sighs)

25:09.716 --> 25:13.553
If those perpetrators are ever delivered
into the hands of justice

25:13.637 --> 25:17.432
and I have anything to do with it,
they had better beg for mercy,

25:17.516 --> 25:22.312
'cause I am gonna personally hang them
by their personal parts from a flagpole

25:22.395 --> 25:24.272
over a cavern of hungry crocodiles

25:24.356 --> 25:27.108
and assorted other animals
of a similar nature. I am--

25:27.192 --> 25:30.779
If I don't pay my car payment Monday,
I'm gonna lose my car.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.742
Hey, what's the color
of that van we're looking for?

25:35.992 --> 25:37.619
It is a white van, Bobby Hill,

25:37.702 --> 25:39.913
with the numerals 737
on the license plate,

25:39.996 --> 25:42.082
none of which happen to coincide
with that van up ahead of us.

25:42.165 --> 25:45.210
Yeah, but this has got a missing bumper,
and a taillight's covered up.

25:45.293 --> 25:46.670
-I'm gonna pull it over.
-(siren chirps)

25:46.753 --> 25:49.881
My friend, you are wasting time
that could be better spent

25:49.965 --> 25:51.591
looking for a more specific
criminal element.

25:51.675 --> 25:52.968
Come on.

25:53.051 --> 25:56.930
-(siren wailing)
-Perhaps I spoke too soon.

25:57.722 --> 26:00.183
This is 2202 now in pursuit of red van,

26:00.267 --> 26:03.186
license unknown, southbound,
Van Ness and 4th.

26:03.270 --> 26:04.771
Get on it. Get on it.

26:04.854 --> 26:05.730
Hold on.

26:05.814 --> 26:08.316
DISPATCHER (over radio):
<i>...respond with backups.</i>

26:08.400 --> 26:10.318
(wailing continues)

26:26.668 --> 26:28.086
Hey, chill!

26:28.169 --> 26:29.421
Your mama's gonna visit you
in the hospital

26:29.504 --> 26:31.881
you move one muscle
in this little body of yours, boy.

26:31.965 --> 26:34.009
-Now, get up against here.
-Take your hands off me, man!

26:34.092 --> 26:35.552
-All right, now spread 'em.
-This is bogus, man!

26:35.635 --> 26:37.846
-I was only hitchhiking!
-They're Diablos.

26:37.929 --> 26:40.849
Two plates under the seat, 737.
It's a match.

26:44.519 --> 26:45.562
Bingo.

26:46.771 --> 26:48.940
Well, well, well,
it looks like we got ourselves

26:49.024 --> 26:51.359
a couple of payroll desperados.

26:58.617 --> 27:01.870
I don't know what you think you got here.
I haven't done nothin'.

27:02.162 --> 27:05.081
Oh, Frankie, you know me.

27:05.165 --> 27:07.584
Been a Girl Scout for the last two years.

27:07.667 --> 27:10.295
The courier ID'd
the Valdez brothers in a lineup.

27:10.378 --> 27:12.589
We sweated them
and they both gave you up, Jesus.

27:12.672 --> 27:14.591
We have sworn statements
from both of them.

27:15.050 --> 27:16.760
JESUS: What do I need the money for?

27:17.344 --> 27:19.304
It so happens we have a theory about that.

27:20.972 --> 27:22.265
Federal Agent Ramsey.

27:22.807 --> 27:23.975
G-man.

27:24.059 --> 27:26.770
Big times, huh, Frankie? I'm impressed.

27:26.853 --> 27:30.106
Mr. Martinez and I were supposed to
become acquainted two weeks ago.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.442
We were scheduled
to discuss the disposition

27:32.525 --> 27:35.570
of a certain $45,000 federal grant.

27:36.071 --> 27:37.781
When Mr. Martinez failed to appear,

27:37.864 --> 27:42.869
I took the liberty of tracking
his recent financial odyssey, if I may.

27:44.204 --> 27:46.039
(sighs) Uh...

27:46.122 --> 27:48.833
December 19th, he receives
payment of the grant,

27:48.917 --> 27:51.628
which he immediately invested
in silver futures.

27:51.961 --> 27:55.465
He scored an impressive
$60,000 profit by January 24th,

27:55.548 --> 27:58.468
at which point he transferred
all the money to treasury bills.

27:58.551 --> 28:01.930
Yeah, it was time
for some conservative strategy.

28:02.013 --> 28:05.350
Uh, two weeks later,
he began investing in commodities futures,

28:05.433 --> 28:09.229
everything from plywood to pork bellies
with considerable success,

28:09.312 --> 28:12.190
until February 23rd,

28:12.273 --> 28:16.236
Pearl Harbor Day for Mr. Martinez's
little embezzlement campaign.

28:16.319 --> 28:17.570
Uh, betting on a shortage,

28:17.654 --> 28:20.031
Martinez puts his whole pot
in bean futures,

28:20.115 --> 28:22.450
but a cold snap fails to materialize.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.495
And Mr. Martinez's investment
goes right into the toilet.

28:25.912 --> 28:28.456
At this point, he becomes aware
I'd begun making inquiries.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.917
He's turned down
for a covering loan at the bank.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.878
Hence the need for a quick
financial transfusion,

28:34.587 --> 28:36.131
hence the robbery.

28:41.177 --> 28:42.721
What do you have to say, Jesus?

28:44.055 --> 28:47.183
I say the man did his homework
rather well, Frankie.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.519
I don't know when you plan
to start taking this seriously,

28:49.602 --> 28:51.354
but for your own sake, I hope it's soon.

28:53.189 --> 28:57.485
Okay, maybe I got a problem here,
but you guys got a problem, too.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.988
I-I don't see where, Mr. Martinez.

29:00.071 --> 29:01.656
Not you, G-man.

29:02.323 --> 29:06.161
The guys that didn't get paid,
who want to know where the money is.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.371
Maybe I can help you there.

29:09.247 --> 29:11.082
And maybe you can help me.

29:14.294 --> 29:15.920
(whistling)

29:16.004 --> 29:18.798
Sounds like cohabitation
agrees with you, Howard.

29:19.382 --> 29:20.759
Oh, actually not, old sport.

29:20.842 --> 29:23.678
Nurse Wulfawitz and I just
couldn't make a go of it.

29:23.762 --> 29:24.846
I'm sorry.

29:24.929 --> 29:29.392
Oh, my sun is rising considerably further
to the east these days.

29:29.476 --> 29:30.435
Buffalo?

29:31.394 --> 29:33.772
I am seeing the most fascinating
woman, Henry.

29:33.855 --> 29:37.484
She's bright. She's beautiful.
She's wonderfully different.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.111
Mm. She's Vietnamese.

29:40.195 --> 29:42.155
No kidding. Where'd you meet her?

29:43.031 --> 29:46.075
Uh, at my Confucian study seminar.

29:48.286 --> 29:49.954
I-I have bursitis.

29:55.210 --> 29:58.588
Isn't anybody watching the cop-tip line?

30:00.507 --> 30:02.592
(sighs)

30:02.675 --> 30:03.968
(machine beeps)

30:04.052 --> 30:06.888
MAN (on voicemail): <i>I just seen a dude</i>
<i>flash a nickel bag to a brother</i>

30:06.971 --> 30:08.515
<i>at Third and Dupont.</i>

30:08.598 --> 30:12.894
<i>My name is Cozar Johnson,</i>
<i>and I'll be by to pick up my 25 today.</i>

30:14.395 --> 30:15.897
(beeps)

30:15.980 --> 30:17.857
WOMAN: <i>Hello, cop-tips,</i>

30:17.941 --> 30:21.152
<i>I'm calling about a man</i>
<i>who lives downstairs from us,</i>

30:21.236 --> 30:23.988
<i>always parks his car in the red zone--</i>

30:24.072 --> 30:25.865
(tape fast-forwarding)

30:27.617 --> 30:28.451
(beeps)

30:28.535 --> 30:31.287
MAN: <i>Yeah, I want to report</i>
<i>a Jimmy Frumento,</i>

30:31.371 --> 30:34.499
<i>lives at 205 North Utica, apartment 4-D.</i>

30:34.958 --> 30:37.293
<i>He's the one that shot</i>
<i>that cop last night.</i>

30:40.171 --> 30:41.840
Ooh, run, Jimmy!

30:45.468 --> 30:46.970
-Get up!
-Hey, come on!

30:47.053 --> 30:50.181
-(shouting)
-The wall! Hands high!

30:50.265 --> 30:51.266
Spread 'em!

30:51.891 --> 30:52.892
Come on!

30:56.062 --> 31:00.108
I wanna hear one word outta you,
golf ball, Rollie Simone.

31:00.191 --> 31:01.776
Now, was it Simone sent you after the bag?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.361
What bag, man? What Simone?

31:03.444 --> 31:05.363
Who was the bozo you were with,
your partner?

31:05.446 --> 31:07.657
I'm telling you, I don't know
what you're talking about!

31:07.740 --> 31:08.950
You shot a cop!

31:09.492 --> 31:13.663
-You know what kind of time that buys?
-Oh, no, look. Look, that wasn't me.

31:13.746 --> 31:14.914
That wasn't me pulled the trigger.

31:14.998 --> 31:16.082
Who?

31:16.457 --> 31:18.835
Joey, Joey Lake.
He's the one who pulled the trigger.

31:18.918 --> 31:21.963
So what? I bet it was your idea
to take the cops down to begin with.

31:22.046 --> 31:24.424
No! No, man!
That was supposed to be a setup.

31:24.507 --> 31:27.135
Me-me and Joey were supposed to get
the bag for somebody else.

31:27.218 --> 31:30.305
Man, that's all! I didn't even know!
There was cops that had the bag!

31:30.388 --> 31:32.807
Somebody who? Simone?

31:32.891 --> 31:34.934
-I don't know! It's a friend of Joey's.
-Who?

31:35.935 --> 31:38.688
Okay. Okay, Iggy.
Iggy, that's all I know.

31:38.771 --> 31:40.273
I don't know the last name, honest.

31:40.356 --> 31:42.483
He's a cop. He's a cop out of Midtown.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.485
I didn't even know
what was in the bag, man.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.322
Come on, move!

31:49.532 --> 31:52.327
Have any threats been made
to induce you to plead guilty?

31:52.785 --> 31:53.828
No, sir.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.622
Any promise other than the promise

31:55.705 --> 31:59.125
that in exchange
for your providing Captain Furillo

31:59.208 --> 32:02.086
with the whereabouts
of the fruits of your crime

32:02.545 --> 32:04.923
you'll be sentenced
to a term of incarceration

32:05.006 --> 32:07.675
-not to exceed two years?
-No, sir.

32:08.509 --> 32:10.595
(sighs)

32:11.512 --> 32:13.848
Defendant's plea of guilty is accepted.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.516
Remand for sentencing.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.311
Set a date for a probation report.

32:19.604 --> 32:20.855
-(gavel bangs)
-Next.

32:22.398 --> 32:26.486
BAILIFF: Docket number N693772,
Leonard Dulcimer

32:26.569 --> 32:30.782
charged with 130.30 of the Penal Code,
grand larceny of the person.

32:32.241 --> 32:34.827
-Your Honor, may we approach?
-Step up.

32:40.541 --> 32:43.503
Look, I know this is going to
sound like a fairy tale,

32:43.586 --> 32:45.421
but I've got an innocent man here.

32:48.132 --> 32:49.008
Thank you.

32:52.178 --> 32:55.014
So, Frankie, what do you figure,
eight months?

32:56.182 --> 32:57.600
Eight months, a year.

32:58.267 --> 33:00.269
You want to say something nice
to the probation lady?

33:00.353 --> 33:01.354
No.

33:02.438 --> 33:03.731
Hey, no sweat.

33:04.482 --> 33:06.859
I got a lot of friends
in Clarktown, anyway.

33:07.735 --> 33:10.154
Play a little cards, watch some TV.

33:10.738 --> 33:12.657
Need a vacation anyway, you know, bro?

33:12.740 --> 33:15.076
I really thought
you were gonna make it, Jesus.

33:15.743 --> 33:17.996
Was I a disappointment to you, Furillo?

33:18.663 --> 33:20.540
Well, let me tell you something, bro.

33:20.623 --> 33:22.333
I don't live for your approval.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.377
You had it all right there at your feet:

33:24.794 --> 33:27.338
federal grant, legitimacy, a power base.

33:27.672 --> 33:31.551
-I explain it only one way.
-Please, no racist remarks, huh?

33:31.634 --> 33:33.594
You didn't want to make it.
You got scared.

33:33.678 --> 33:35.930
-You don't know beans.
-(chuckles)

33:37.640 --> 33:39.475
From the look of it, neither do you.

33:43.354 --> 33:49.736
The way I look at it, when I come out,
Rockefeller's gonna have nothing on me.

33:49.819 --> 33:51.738
Which one of your people do I deal with?

33:52.530 --> 33:55.366
Yo, bro, I'm not goin' to the moon.

33:55.908 --> 33:58.411
You need me, I'm just a phone call away.

33:59.203 --> 34:02.123
Hey, Al Capone can do it, why can't I?

34:07.420 --> 34:09.088
Take care of yourself, Jesus.

34:13.092 --> 34:14.343
Yo, Frankie...

34:15.553 --> 34:16.721
stay healthy.

34:25.855 --> 34:28.274
I don't know what to say, Miss Davenport.

34:28.357 --> 34:30.151
-You saved my life.
-Nonsense.

34:30.234 --> 34:32.111
I gave you your day in court, that's all.

34:32.445 --> 34:33.946
Now scat. Go home.

34:34.655 --> 34:37.158
Um, Miss Davenport, I'm sorry,

34:37.241 --> 34:40.453
but I... I don't have any way
to get back to work.

34:40.536 --> 34:41.537
I'm broke.

34:41.621 --> 34:42.872
I was wondering if maybe you could lend me

34:42.955 --> 34:45.750
a couple of bucks for a cab
till I get my next paycheck.

34:47.001 --> 34:49.212
Forget about a loan. Take it.

34:49.295 --> 34:51.964
Hey! Will you stop that kid?
He just took my purse!

34:52.048 --> 34:54.967
-(buzzing)
-All right, all right. Hold your horses.

34:58.554 --> 34:59.931
You guys here to pick something up?

35:00.014 --> 35:02.391
-You could say that.
-First, we got something to give you.

35:02.475 --> 35:05.103
-You're Ignatius Mersky, right?
-Right.

35:06.604 --> 35:09.065
-This is a warrant.
-MICK: That's right. You're under arrest.

35:09.607 --> 35:13.528
What? What is this, a joke?
What's the charge?

35:13.611 --> 35:15.947
Conspiracy, robbery, attempted murder--

35:16.030 --> 35:17.949
Hey, read it on the paper.

35:18.366 --> 35:20.493
Hey, that's crazy! I'm on your side!

35:20.576 --> 35:22.662
-I don't do things like that.
-Oh, sure.

35:23.412 --> 35:25.832
Listen, you got no right
coming in here like this.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.291
I'm Midtown.

35:27.375 --> 35:30.002
-You don't have the authority.
-Get outta the cage!

35:30.086 --> 35:32.964
-There's gotta be a mistake.
-No mistake, chump.

35:33.047 --> 35:35.633
Now, do you want to come out
of that cage like a good boy,

35:35.716 --> 35:37.969
or do I get the pleasure
of dragging you out?

35:38.886 --> 35:41.389
-Can I lock up?
-No, you can't. It'll be taken care of.

35:41.472 --> 35:43.141
-Now, let's go.
-Come on.

35:46.769 --> 35:51.649
Listen, there are six diamond rings
back there, fit right in your pocket.

35:52.275 --> 35:54.735
Just tell them I was gone
when you got here.

35:57.697 --> 35:58.739
Earrings.

35:59.115 --> 36:01.284
-Cuff links.
-Turn around.

36:06.831 --> 36:08.207
Come on. Take it easy.

36:08.291 --> 36:11.627
<i>Uncle John's Storybook Theater,</i> hey,
we don't want to miss the start.

36:19.385 --> 36:22.263
Once upon a time,
there was a down-and-out property clerk

36:22.346 --> 36:23.890
named Iggy Mersky.

36:23.973 --> 36:27.143
Poor Iggy, 14 years
in the Midtown property cage,

36:27.226 --> 36:30.271
and all he's holding
is 16-and-a-half Gs a year,

36:30.354 --> 36:32.899
zero career promos, house and car payments

36:32.982 --> 36:35.651
that leave him about eight bucks a week
walking-around money,

36:35.735 --> 36:38.446
and an old lady bugging him for cable TV.

36:38.529 --> 36:39.906
You leave my family out of this.

36:39.989 --> 36:42.241
-(shushes)
-J.D.: Poor Iggy.

36:42.325 --> 36:44.410
All he's got to look forward to
is a two-bit pension

36:44.493 --> 36:47.371
and a first-rate midlife crisis,

36:47.955 --> 36:50.666
till one day everything changes,

36:50.750 --> 36:53.711
-a heavy soda bust.
-Very heavy.

36:54.170 --> 36:57.673
Twenty pounds of Peruvian flake
is stashed in an airline travel bag

36:57.757 --> 36:59.133
in Iggy's property room.

36:59.717 --> 37:01.510
Now, let's give Iggy
the benefit of the doubt.

37:01.594 --> 37:04.013
Okay, let's say he's
minding his own business.

37:04.096 --> 37:06.182
He's got his nose buried
in the morning sports,

37:06.265 --> 37:08.100
he's having his Danish and coffee,

37:08.184 --> 37:13.481
when, hark and behold, he hears a voice.

37:14.774 --> 37:19.570
"Psst! Iggy!"

37:21.656 --> 37:24.408
"What is that?" Iggy wonders.

37:25.034 --> 37:31.123
"Hey, dummy, over here.
It's me, the bag."

37:31.916 --> 37:33.834
This guy needs professional help.

37:33.918 --> 37:38.965
"I'm a pocketful of dreams, Iggy--

37:39.048 --> 37:43.719
pure Peruvian flake, worth 400 Gs
on the open market."

37:44.387 --> 37:46.180
Now, this is a fairy tale, huh?

37:46.264 --> 37:47.807
Let's say Iggy fights it off.

37:47.890 --> 37:50.476
I mean, 'cause you didn't offer
us a bribe before, right, Ig?

37:50.559 --> 37:52.144
You ain't that kind of guy.

37:54.021 --> 37:58.484
"Iggy. Listen to me.

37:59.485 --> 38:02.405
They'll never need me for evidence.

38:02.488 --> 38:06.492
Hey, they'll plea-bargain my case.
It'll never come to trial.

38:07.076 --> 38:09.453
Stuff me full of baking soda, Iggy.

38:09.537 --> 38:12.873
Sell off the coke.
Live it up for a change.

38:12.957 --> 38:16.252
Beaches, mai tais
with them little, funny umbrellas.

38:16.877 --> 38:21.048
I'm your one chance for happiness, Iggy.
Go for it!"

38:22.258 --> 38:23.467
Come on. Cut it out.

38:24.093 --> 38:25.970
Only trouble is, Iggy,
they don't plea-bargain the case.

38:26.053 --> 38:27.555
They set a date
for the preliminary hearing.

38:27.638 --> 38:29.640
Now, you're getting real nervous.

38:29.724 --> 38:33.436
Then Washington and Benedetto
need some scenery for a bust.

38:33.519 --> 38:35.229
They check the bag out.

38:36.647 --> 38:38.441
It's perfect, Iggy. It's your out.

38:39.483 --> 38:41.569
You tip Simone off to queer the bust.

38:41.652 --> 38:45.072
You hire that scuzzbag Jimmy Frumento
to take down the cops,

38:45.156 --> 38:47.325
then nobody will ever know
you made the switch...

38:49.118 --> 38:50.995
except for poppy boy Jimmy.

38:51.078 --> 38:52.455
He's a nickel hooker.

38:52.538 --> 38:54.957
He gives you up
in about a minute and a half.

38:56.042 --> 39:00.546
That was my partner you had hit,
you little creep, my partner.

39:00.629 --> 39:02.548
Two inches lower, he'd be dead now.

39:02.631 --> 39:05.176
I didn't have anybody hit.
What the hell do you think I am?

39:05.259 --> 39:08.679
I think you're a slug
who better make his best deal right now.

39:08.763 --> 39:13.351
You act like I'm some mastermind,
like I'm a big genius.

39:15.269 --> 39:16.979
I got three lousy grand.

39:18.064 --> 39:19.607
It was all Benedetto.

39:22.651 --> 39:23.569
Benedetto?

39:23.652 --> 39:27.239
He figured out the whole thing
from the start.

39:27.323 --> 39:28.574
Benedetto.

39:32.828 --> 39:34.288
Everything in order, Mr. Benedetto?

39:34.372 --> 39:36.499
Yeah, everything's just terrific, ma'am.
Thank you.

39:36.582 --> 39:37.708
Forget it, Benedetto!

39:38.167 --> 39:39.168
Yeah, right.

39:44.256 --> 39:47.051
(sirens wailing, tires screeching)

39:48.928 --> 39:50.012
HENRY: As far as we can tell, Frank,

39:50.096 --> 39:53.808
he's holed up in this small waiting room
off the safe-deposit-box area.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.476
The room's 10x30, Captain.

39:55.559 --> 39:57.395
It's a series of cubicles
with some chairs.

39:57.478 --> 40:01.399
There's one ventilating duct,
9x12, there, and no windows.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.444
-How's the lady?
-No visual access.

40:05.528 --> 40:07.196
Benedetto's turned up pretty high, Frank.

40:07.279 --> 40:09.240
There's no telling what he's capable of.

40:09.573 --> 40:12.410
I made that rat the minute
he walked into the squad room,

40:12.493 --> 40:14.620
big shot, big noise from Midtown.

40:14.703 --> 40:16.789
What do you say we deal
with the present, okay, J.D.?

40:16.872 --> 40:20.543
Sure, sure.
Bastard sets up one of his own.

40:22.294 --> 40:23.671
Any contact with him at all?

40:23.754 --> 40:25.506
Not since the first exchange.

40:25.756 --> 40:28.592
He's got a clean shot at anything
that goes by that door.

40:28.676 --> 40:32.179
It's kind of hard to initiate a dialogue
through a wall and a set of bars.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.849
For some, Henry. Perhaps for some.

40:35.224 --> 40:36.517
Oh, for God's sake.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.478
Textbook scenario, Frank,
cybernetics-wise.

40:40.229 --> 40:43.065
I believe those among us
who have been regarding TK

40:43.149 --> 40:46.360
as a glorified domestic
might be pleasantly surprised.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.154
This is not <i>Space Invaders,</i> Howard.

40:48.529 --> 40:52.450
I mean, you don't negotiate human lives
with some overpriced gumball machine.

40:52.533 --> 40:57.913
TK460 was not designed to supplant
your negotiating function, Lieutenant--

40:57.997 --> 41:01.000
merely to enhance it by giving you
audio and visual access

41:01.083 --> 41:02.877
where there was none hitherto.

41:05.171 --> 41:07.047
I'm open to other suggestions, Henry.

41:08.924 --> 41:14.221
Oh, yeah, we're gonna go places, baby.
Oh, we're gonna see things. (laughs)

41:15.014 --> 41:16.015
Fine.

41:18.684 --> 41:22.813
-(sobbing)
-Hey, it's gonna be all right.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.398
Don't worry about nothin'.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.317
(shudders)

41:27.735 --> 41:29.361
(woman screams)

41:31.071 --> 41:32.740
You gotta be kidding me.

41:33.324 --> 41:36.577
Hey. Hey, 86 the robo, will ya?

41:37.453 --> 41:40.331
<i>You jerks! You got no class whatsoever.</i>

41:40.748 --> 41:42.917
Then come out, Benedetto.
We'll put it away.

41:43.542 --> 41:45.461
Come on, Sal. Talk to us.

41:45.836 --> 41:48.214
-What do you need?
-(chuckles) <i>What do I need?</i>

41:48.923 --> 41:52.927
<i>A Learjet to Banana Land,</i>
<i>a case of suntan oil,</i>

41:53.010 --> 41:56.138
<i>and Mrs. Dobson here</i>
<i>to be blond and 20 years old!</i>

41:56.222 --> 41:58.724
(laughs) <i>How's my chances?</i>

41:58.807 --> 42:01.352
A lot better than Washington's were,
you maggot!

42:01.810 --> 42:04.188
Hey, hey, that was a mistake.

42:04.271 --> 42:06.232
Hey, is he out there? Huh?

42:06.315 --> 42:09.777
<i>Hey, Washington, that was a mistake.</i>
<i>You weren't supposed to get hurt.</i>

42:09.860 --> 42:12.196
(breathing heavily)

42:17.493 --> 42:18.744
<i>Hey, look, uh...</i>

42:21.622 --> 42:23.082
<i>Look, I'm sending the broad out.</i>

42:23.541 --> 42:24.750
Good for you, Sal.

42:25.125 --> 42:27.670
Yeah, good for me, you Froot Loop.

42:27.753 --> 42:30.089
Back off with the vibrator, will ya?

42:32.424 --> 42:34.593
Nah, never mind.

42:37.471 --> 42:40.474
All right. Go ahead, sweetheart, take off.

42:42.351 --> 42:44.562
Up! Out! Go on! Go on!

42:47.439 --> 42:49.400
Man hands in his trump card.

42:49.858 --> 42:50.943
We're gonna lose him.

42:51.819 --> 42:52.945
(chuckling)

42:55.114 --> 42:56.949
(grunting)

43:07.251 --> 43:08.168
(thuds)

43:10.754 --> 43:14.425
<i>Always gotta do things for yourself, huh.</i>
(laughs)

43:14.508 --> 43:17.511
<i>All right, listen. Listen up, you jerks.</i>

43:18.721 --> 43:22.975
<i>I got another box</i>
<i>over at First Guarantee, Walter Fisk.</i>

43:23.058 --> 43:27.730
<i>And one over at Union Federal,</i>
<i>name of Arthur Logan.</i>

43:27.813 --> 43:29.898
<i>Give the dough to the PBA.</i>

43:29.982 --> 43:32.151
<i>All the stiffs never knew</i>
<i>how to turn a buck.</i>

43:32.234 --> 43:33.569
Benedetto, listen--

43:33.652 --> 43:36.488
<i>Yeah, what is it, Captain, huh?</i>
<i>Hey, what's the good word, huh?</i>

43:36.572 --> 43:39.366
<i>What, "A good cop's a straight cop,</i>

43:39.450 --> 43:40.993
<i>an honest cop's a happy cop"?</i>

43:41.076 --> 43:43.245
<i>Yeah, well, you can take a high colonic.</i>

43:44.038 --> 43:47.124
(chuckles) <i>I'm proud of what I did.</i>

43:47.708 --> 43:50.502
<i>Yeah, I lived real good.</i>

43:52.463 --> 43:53.505
<i>And, uh...</i>

43:54.965 --> 43:57.343
<i>give some to Mouse Feldstein's old lady.</i>

43:58.010 --> 43:59.845
<i>I cooled the Mouse out, too.</i>

44:01.096 --> 44:04.058
<i>-You got it?</i>
-Hey, you got the right idea, there, Sal!

44:04.141 --> 44:06.185
-Do the right thing!
-(gunshot)

44:15.194 --> 44:17.404
(telephone ringing)

44:20.115 --> 44:21.825
-Sorry.
-My fault entirely.

44:21.909 --> 44:25.204
You know, that little robot is gonna be
sorely missed around here.

44:25.287 --> 44:28.332
That's the first time TK's
equilibrium problems have surfaced.

44:28.624 --> 44:31.752
I trust it merely needs some fine-tuning.

44:32.419 --> 44:34.421
I guess that means that you'll be gone.

44:34.505 --> 44:37.675
-Of course, you'll be gone, too.
-Back across the briny.

44:38.592 --> 44:39.551
I was wondering--

44:40.260 --> 44:42.471
I know it's uncustomary late
of me to ask--

44:42.554 --> 44:45.683
would you and Joe be free this evening?

44:47.226 --> 44:49.311
I think that could be arranged. Yeah.

44:50.062 --> 44:51.146
Excuse me.

44:51.980 --> 44:55.693
You know, you and I could even--

44:56.443 --> 45:00.781
I mean, I haven't actually
had a chaperon since I was 21.

45:02.116 --> 45:06.036
I'd be delighted if we could
make it a threesome.

45:07.788 --> 45:10.541
Okay, well,
if that's what you'd like, sure.

45:13.168 --> 45:14.461
Does that sort of thing interest you?

45:15.170 --> 45:16.004
What's that?

45:17.256 --> 45:19.591
Threesomes.
I mean, would Joe be interested?

45:25.013 --> 45:28.517
You know, I think
probably I could speak for him

45:28.809 --> 45:32.146
in that, uh, I think he's probably busy.

45:34.148 --> 45:35.107
Pity.

45:35.441 --> 45:38.444
In fact, you know,
now that I think about it...

45:39.820 --> 45:41.071
I'm gonna be tied up...

45:42.197 --> 45:43.115
as it were.

45:51.957 --> 45:53.125
Heard you lost one.

45:55.794 --> 45:57.045
He won't be missed.

45:58.922 --> 45:59.923
Going somewhere?

46:00.007 --> 46:02.217
I took the liberty of packing for you.

46:02.593 --> 46:05.971
I also took the liberty
of booking a luxury weekend for two

46:06.054 --> 46:08.223
at the Lake Tokawama Hotel.

46:08.307 --> 46:09.850
Bless you, my child.

46:10.684 --> 46:12.227
All of which presupposes

46:12.311 --> 46:15.898
I wouldn't get all my cash
and credit cards stolen.

46:15.981 --> 46:17.733
-Did you file a report?
-Mm-hmm.

46:17.816 --> 46:21.862
Frank, I just wanted us
to get away for a weekend.

46:21.945 --> 46:23.947
-Now we're tapped out.
-I'll kite a check.

46:24.031 --> 46:26.408
Before there was you,
Counselor, and timely loans--

46:26.492 --> 46:27.868
Frank, do you see what I see?

46:28.619 --> 46:30.537
-I hope so.
-Jesus just kept his word.

46:30.621 --> 46:33.332
Money just got returned.
Thought maybe you could use yours.

46:33.415 --> 46:36.001
Lieutenant, I see you
with a halo over your head.

46:37.711 --> 46:39.963
HENRY: All right. All right, everybody...

46:40.047 --> 46:41.882
Cash! Solvency!

46:41.965 --> 46:43.509
Don't be extreme.

46:45.469 --> 46:48.555
-Hey, Leo.
-Rico. Hey, how'd your registration go?

46:48.639 --> 46:51.308
-You get into your class?
-Hey, registration.

46:51.809 --> 46:54.019
Exactly. I want to talk to you about that.

46:55.395 --> 46:57.856
(chuckles) You understand?

46:58.524 --> 46:59.775
You understand me?

47:00.317 --> 47:02.027
Yeah. You're high.

47:03.403 --> 47:05.531
Hey, no, hey, you understand me, Leo.

47:07.324 --> 47:10.911
-You better go away.
-Hey, why? What's the matter?

47:11.787 --> 47:14.581
-You know.
-Yeah, I know.

47:14.665 --> 47:16.917
Yeah, you think I don't know?

47:17.251 --> 47:20.254
Hey, let me tell you something.
Hey, let me tell you something, Leo.

47:20.337 --> 47:24.591
Uh, I'm gonna tell you--
Hey, don't you think I know, huh?

47:25.175 --> 47:28.428
(stutters) Didn't I go to school?

47:28.512 --> 47:31.181
I go to school. (laughs)

47:32.224 --> 47:33.517
Didn't I try to ride the bus?

47:33.600 --> 47:35.352
Yeah.
(makes engine noise)

47:36.478 --> 47:38.313
I did. I walked.

47:38.939 --> 47:41.358
I walked, and it was very far.

47:41.441 --> 47:44.653
(chuckles) Cars go and splash me--

47:44.736 --> 47:46.029
You should've made it.

47:47.364 --> 47:49.449
Yeah, I probably should've.

47:50.576 --> 47:52.786
But it's a little splash, you know?

47:53.495 --> 47:55.330
-(stutters)
-Go away!

47:55.414 --> 47:57.332
Hey, Leo! Stay!

47:57.416 --> 47:58.292
I probably should...

47:58.375 --> 48:00.210
I probably should've made it, you know?

48:01.128 --> 48:03.213
Yeah. Okay.

48:05.090 --> 48:06.133
Cohen.

48:06.925 --> 48:08.302
-Conklin.
-Oh.

48:09.177 --> 48:10.178
HENRY: Delaney.

48:10.846 --> 48:12.055
-Mary.
-Okay, Leo.

48:13.015 --> 48:14.182
HENRY: Rose.

48:18.061 --> 48:19.479
-Diamond.
-Yo.

48:20.147 --> 48:22.274
-HENRY: Diaz.
-Here, Lieutenant.
