WEBVTT

00:35.117 --> 00:37.870
She had no idea what was going on.

00:37.955 --> 00:40.415
By the time they get her to me,
she's frothing at the mouth.

00:40.499 --> 00:43.417
- Oh, Christ.
- Gosh, that glaze looks wonderful.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.878
- How do you get that lovely color?
- Thank you.

00:46.255 --> 00:48.881
I use molasses,
more than you think.

00:48.965 --> 00:51.552
I always thicken it up on the hob
before it goes in the oven.

00:51.635 --> 00:53.844
So, now they call him Pavarotti.

00:59.642 --> 01:03.105
Fred's been making me listen to opera.

01:03.187 --> 01:04.731
He says it's good for baby.

01:04.815 --> 01:05.940
Really?

01:06.023 --> 01:09.235
Babies are like sponges,
even in the womb.

01:09.318 --> 01:12.863
My job is to make sure
baby's only absorbing goodness.

01:17.785 --> 01:21.248
- That's fascinating.
- Quickly! Give me your hand.

01:26.294 --> 01:29.630
There!
Did you feel it?

01:33.885 --> 01:35.511
There it is.

01:39.473 --> 01:40.808
Excuse me.

01:41.518 --> 01:42.936
4-5-7-8, hello?

01:45.105 --> 01:46.273
Hello?

01:46.981 --> 01:48.150
Wrong number.

01:48.734 --> 01:52.445
Sit down, son.
I'm afraid I've got some sad news.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.826
No point in dragging it out.

02:00.036 --> 02:01.370
I'm dying.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.915
Cancer of the bowel.

02:04.498 --> 02:08.294
Your brother's had some of his best
people working on it for a while.

02:09.671 --> 02:13.675
I've a year left...
Maybe a little less.

02:29.441 --> 02:30.566
Hello?

02:31.068 --> 02:33.569
I can't believe I only
saw you four hours ago.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.280
I miss you like crazy.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.032
Hello, Heather.

02:37.573 --> 02:38.575
Have you packed?

02:39.075 --> 02:41.203
Yes... we're just
in the middle of dinner.

02:41.786 --> 02:44.206
I'll wait for you
on the corner. At 12.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.459
I'm really looking
forward to it.

02:48.794 --> 02:50.295
I love you.

02:51.462 --> 02:52.922
You too.

03:01.223 --> 03:05.434
That was... Heather.
About the... bake sale on Sunday.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.825
I love you, Helen.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.203
I love you, too.

04:05.494 --> 04:07.079
You're repulsed by me.

04:13.462 --> 04:15.339
I am not repulsed by you.

04:22.136 --> 04:27.683
You chose this neighborhood.
You chose this house. You...

04:27.767 --> 04:30.729
And you chose the curtains.
You chose the crockery.

04:32.313 --> 04:33.689
You chose to work.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.361
You chose this life...

04:41.364 --> 04:42.699
with me.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.540
We should have a baby.

04:56.839 --> 04:59.967
Can't you say something,
for Christ's sake?

05:02.093 --> 05:04.053
My father's dying.

05:32.415 --> 05:36.670
- Jack...
- Please? Please, my love.

05:38.755 --> 05:39.923
Please?

05:41.884 --> 05:43.760
It'll help me sleep.

06:55.873 --> 06:57.458
You're late.

06:59.335 --> 07:00.711
Sorry.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.530
Jack doesn't know this place exists.

07:29.658 --> 07:32.160
I inherited it from a maiden aunt.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.328
"Maiden aunt"?

07:34.912 --> 07:36.497
Miss Lizzie Eaves.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.635
Raging lesbian, of course.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.313
And we have...

08:00.271 --> 08:03.149
- Hey! Free electricity.
- Electricity!

08:04.233 --> 08:05.527
Did we steal it?

08:09.489 --> 08:12.658
Glodean, how am I meant
to get them to sleep now?

08:14.410 --> 08:16.330
- Come on. Night, Auntie.
- Thank you.

08:16.413 --> 08:17.623
Come on, little man.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.793
Free electricity!
Free electricity!

08:25.171 --> 08:28.090
- Yeah, that's it.
- Yeah, I made it with a kick, babe.

08:28.799 --> 08:29.968
You did?

08:30.301 --> 08:32.720
- So, what? Is this just for me?
- Just for you.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.347
All right, get a room.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.520
This is it.

08:40.478 --> 08:43.774
- You see, I thought you forgot about us.
- Impossible.

08:45.067 --> 08:46.568
You all know Helen.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.654
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:52.281 --> 08:55.493
To say thank you...
for... letting me stay.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.792
Thanks, that was
very nice of you.

09:03.668 --> 09:08.173
This ain't just some hotel she could have
a holiday away from her rich husband.

09:09.590 --> 09:10.758
It's not a holiday.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.221
Why do you always go
with white girls, Nour?

09:14.304 --> 09:16.722
- Excuse me?
- Does it make you feel good?

09:16.807 --> 09:19.475
- Come on, Lin.
- To think about her husband?

09:20.561 --> 09:24.231
Or maybe... it's 'cause you
want everything that he's got.

09:24.773 --> 09:27.817
A nice little house,
a nice little wife.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.948
And a pair
of pretty little kids.

09:33.030 --> 09:35.033
- Nice to see you, Helen.
- Fuck you, Lin.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.534
All right, enough.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.039
If you need to stay, you stay.

09:46.503 --> 09:47.963
Was that true?

09:48.671 --> 09:49.631
What?

09:50.464 --> 09:51.924
That you want kids.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.970
I mean... yeah.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.433
I want a family...
one day.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.479
Why?

10:15.199 --> 10:16.449
I don't know.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.883
I thought Lin
would be all right.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.428
I didn't think it would
be this complicated.

10:40.264 --> 10:41.517
It's family.

10:43.352 --> 10:44.810
Family's complicated.

10:51.734 --> 10:52.818
Hey.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.571
You okay?

10:55.447 --> 10:56.782
Yeah.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.210
Morning, Heather.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.213
Morning, Helen.
How was your weekend?

11:11.921 --> 11:13.340
Lovely, thank you.

11:13.423 --> 11:16.092
My dyke girlfriend fucked me cross-eyed,
how was yours?

11:16.176 --> 11:17.219
- Helen!
- Heather!

11:18.094 --> 11:20.472
- Could I have a quick word?
- Of course.

11:20.555 --> 11:23.976
We've been made aware of your change
in circumstances.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.771
I don't know what you mean.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.491
Jack told you, didn't he?

11:43.244 --> 11:44.872
I really need this job.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.542
Honestly...
what did you expect?

11:50.167 --> 11:52.713
This is a family library, Helen.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.855
Soon as mine found out
I was with Lin,

12:09.937 --> 12:12.357
he decided
he wanted full custody.

12:15.526 --> 12:18.614
Sent a social worker around
last week to interview the kids.

12:19.071 --> 12:22.409
Worried for their...
"psychosexual development."

12:25.037 --> 12:28.080
Mikey's not mine,
he's Lin's ex's.

12:28.956 --> 12:30.334
Where's she?

12:31.752 --> 12:33.294
Prison.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.004
What did she do?

12:35.797 --> 12:37.590
Defended herself.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.066
You ready?

13:01.365 --> 13:04.533
You're goin', hon.
You look good.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.108
Police!

15:01.192 --> 15:02.194
Police!

15:02.569 --> 15:05.030
Police! Police!

15:05.739 --> 15:09.117
- We're looking for a missing person!
- Yeah, we're all missing people in here!

15:09.201 --> 15:10.786
Think you're funny, do ya?!

15:10.868 --> 15:12.703
Why don't you tell us
who you're looking for,

15:12.787 --> 15:15.624
and then we can tell you
if we've seen them. How 'bout that?

15:15.706 --> 15:18.042
A woman went
missing six weeks ago!

15:18.126 --> 15:19.795
We've had a report she's
been seen in the area.

15:20.170 --> 15:23.674
Name of Helen McGregor,
early 30s, long brown hair.

15:24.216 --> 15:28.136
Husband said she has
something that belongs to him.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.263
Nah, no one fittin'
that description here.

15:30.347 --> 15:33.266
Well, we'll see about that!

15:35.143 --> 15:36.394
Fuck!

15:36.769 --> 15:38.397
Go on! Piss off!

15:39.857 --> 15:41.316
Get out of here!

15:42.317 --> 15:44.235
You got piss on you!

16:09.219 --> 16:10.678
I'm pregnant.

16:15.349 --> 16:16.977
So how long have you known?

16:19.730 --> 16:20.772
A while.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.193
I thought you weren't
sleeping with him.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.702
So...

16:34.077 --> 16:35.995
we could go to Liverpool.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.373
Lay low there for a while.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.502
Rochelle will have a room for us...

16:45.588 --> 16:46.840
and the baby.

17:03.606 --> 17:06.067
Good morning,
Highgate Women's Clinic.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.322
- Helen McGregor?
- Are you staying overnight?

17:12.824 --> 17:16.703
- I'll pick you up in the morning.
- Okay.

17:39.308 --> 17:42.646
Blood pressure's a little, little high,
but not alarming.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.774
It's her mental state
we need to worry about.

17:46.692 --> 17:49.360
Thank god you put
a call out to the hospitals.

17:49.443 --> 17:53.699
- It's a great network. Good people.
- Thank god we got her in time.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.286
I just want my family back.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.456
Most important thing
is that she stays calm.

18:01.999 --> 18:06.003
If she works herself up with the stress,
it could affect the baby.

18:08.297 --> 18:11.216
I can't stop thinking about
what she was exposed to.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.303
They won't know
to look for her here.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.932
You can stay with us...
until you find a new place.

18:19.390 --> 18:21.643
She's waking up.
Helen?

18:23.979 --> 18:25.772
You're safe now, darling.

18:27.065 --> 18:28.650
And so is the baby.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.279
Everything's gonna be fine.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.534
I've been so worried.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.494
Toilet.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.415
Yes, yes. Toilet. Okay.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.959
All right, here we go.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.421
Nice and slow there,
and up we go.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.252
Helen... are you all right?

19:30.420 --> 19:31.879
I'm fine!

19:42.391 --> 19:43.849
No!

19:44.850 --> 19:47.646
- Come on! It's okay! You're okay.
- All right.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.527
No! No!

20:02.452 --> 20:05.080
- Helen, you're okay!
- Yeah.

20:06.289 --> 20:08.624
- Okay... Very good.
- No!

20:09.417 --> 20:10.668
There we are.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.584
Help!

20:55.004 --> 20:56.215
Help!

21:05.599 --> 21:07.142
Well done, darling.

21:08.352 --> 21:10.061
You're doing brilliantly.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.939
Don't stop.
He's nearly here.

21:48.767 --> 21:50.894
One final push!

21:53.854 --> 21:56.608
- Mummy!
- A boy.

21:58.527 --> 21:59.944
My boy!

22:02.155 --> 22:03.864
Good morning, Mummy.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.995
We're happy to see you.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.334
Would you like
to say good morning?

22:18.589 --> 22:20.090
Darling?

22:31.392 --> 22:32.853
My boy!

22:34.061 --> 22:36.689
My handsome little boy.

22:49.077 --> 22:52.038
Where is she?
Where is she?!

22:53.080 --> 22:54.415
Tell me!

22:55.625 --> 22:56.835
She's sick.

22:58.879 --> 23:00.671
You made her sick.

23:01.130 --> 23:05.677
And we brought her home to get better,
and have the baby.

23:08.679 --> 23:10.014
You're evil.

23:10.432 --> 23:13.477
You're fucking evil.
Damn... you.

23:14.143 --> 23:17.104
Damn your father,
damn your whole line.

23:17.439 --> 23:20.067
May you never know
a day's happiness.

23:20.149 --> 23:23.819
And may your children
be loveless and homeless.

23:23.904 --> 23:28.367
And may you die like a dog
choking on your own shame.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.580
We know where you live.

23:37.501 --> 23:39.878
We know you've got kids in there.

23:41.755 --> 23:44.341
I'd be very careful if I were you.

23:55.851 --> 23:59.106
Hi. Hi, it's okay.

24:00.732 --> 24:02.860
Good, there you go.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.951
Let's try nursing today.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.955
You're full of milk.
You must be sore.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.876
It'll help ease the pressure
if you feed.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.464
My little one loves it.

24:26.382 --> 24:29.218
Come on, now.
It'll help with your mood.

24:42.441 --> 24:44.358
You have to at least hold him.

24:55.286 --> 24:56.954
There you go.

24:57.955 --> 25:00.125
That's not so bad.

25:08.967 --> 25:10.718
Get him off me.

25:15.890 --> 25:17.725
Get him off me!

25:23.065 --> 25:24.732
You're a monster.

25:41.041 --> 25:43.377
We're going to
Dad's funeral now.

25:45.212 --> 25:47.589
Judy's gonna stay
with you and the baby.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.092
We'll only be an hour.

25:54.554 --> 25:56.013
I'm hungry.

25:58.933 --> 26:00.226
You're hungry?

26:01.852 --> 26:04.022
Judy, can we get some breakfast?

26:06.942 --> 26:10.779
I'm sorry about your father, Jack.

26:12.280 --> 26:14.031
He was a good man.

26:17.536 --> 26:18.912
Thank you.

26:35.095 --> 26:37.181
We'll talk when I get back.

26:37.973 --> 26:39.098
Okay?

26:43.896 --> 26:48.232
She seems so much better today.
Just... try and keep her in good spirits.

27:00.453 --> 27:01.746
Judy?

27:05.666 --> 27:08.212
It's my sister's birthday today.

27:09.045 --> 27:10.714
I'd like to call her.

27:11.507 --> 27:14.384
Haven't spoken to her in so long.

27:16.470 --> 27:17.804
Please?

27:40.618 --> 27:41.787
Zero, one.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.125
Nine, four, six.

27:53.881 --> 27:56.051
Zero, one, nine, four.

28:07.144 --> 28:09.480
Hello, sis... It's me.

28:10.691 --> 28:14.361
Sorry, I meant to call sooner,
but I've been unwell.

28:15.570 --> 28:17.863
Happy birthday, by the way.

28:18.406 --> 28:19.657
Where are you?

28:20.992 --> 28:24.580
I expect you're going
to Aunt Lizzie's cabin for the weekend?

28:25.080 --> 28:26.832
I'll meet you there.

28:26.915 --> 28:28.500
Have a marvelous time.

28:29.960 --> 28:32.169
I'll be there in spirit.

28:35.298 --> 28:36.591
I love you.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.418
Helen, I'm coming to get you.

30:09.643 --> 30:11.269
I forgot the eulogy.

30:14.022 --> 30:15.315
Darling?

30:58.859 --> 31:00.652
It's not my baby.

31:12.915 --> 31:14.332
What did they do to you?

31:15.082 --> 31:17.085
Tell me...
Tell me what he did.

31:17.628 --> 31:19.963
Look at me.
I'm gonna kill him.

31:20.046 --> 31:21.172
Okay?

31:23.174 --> 31:24.550
I'm gonna kill him.

31:25.301 --> 31:26.552
I'll kill him.

31:29.348 --> 31:30.682
He's dead.

31:36.312 --> 31:38.064
Where's the baby?

32:05.967 --> 32:07.593
Mama.

32:51.138 --> 32:53.807
Helen! Helen!

32:55.142 --> 32:56.393
Helen!

32:58.270 --> 32:59.771
Helen, please!
