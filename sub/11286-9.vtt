WEBVTT

00:02.730 --> 00:05.496
This is the last time
that I get up

00:05.563 --> 00:07.296
at 4 o'clock in the morning

00:07.363 --> 00:10.096
to drive all the way
to the country to pick apples

00:10.163 --> 00:11.896
that we could've bought
at the store.

00:11.963 --> 00:15.363
I had fun. Didn't you,
my Manly Mcintosh?

00:16.930 --> 00:19.096
I sure did,
my little Granny Smith.

00:20.396 --> 00:23.263
Oh, please, my goodness,
they're at it again.

00:23.330 --> 00:25.563
First it was,
let's kiss every time we see

00:25.630 --> 00:27.730
a New Jersey license plate.

00:27.796 --> 00:30.896
Then it was hide and go smooch
in a apple orchard.

00:30.963 --> 00:34.063
And then...it was
let's kiss in the back seat

00:34.130 --> 00:36.596
with Khadijah in the middle.

00:36.663 --> 00:38.430
I thought
you were sleeping.

00:38.496 --> 00:41.996
I was prayin', "When are
y'all gonna chip a tooth."

00:42.063 --> 00:44.363
Well, it's time
to turn this harvest into

00:44.430 --> 00:48.363
apple pie, apple crisp,
apple sauce and my favorite

00:48.430 --> 00:50.163
apple brown betty.

00:50.230 --> 00:52.896
But I'm changin' it's name
to apple brown Synclaire

00:52.963 --> 00:55.330
'cause it's oh,
so very delicious.

00:56.663 --> 00:57.896

[humming]

01:32.303 --> 01:34.036
Synclaire, what are you doing?

01:34.103 --> 01:37.170
These are seeds from the apple
Overton and I ate together.

01:38.836 --> 01:41.636
I'm putting them
in my scrap book.

01:41.703 --> 01:45.636
"Synclaire and Overton,
the early months."

01:46.636 --> 01:48.670
Here's my favorite memento.

01:49.670 --> 01:52.136
‐ What is it?
‐ A splinter.

01:52.203 --> 01:54.703
I got it the time
that Overton first said those

01:54.770 --> 01:56.036
three special words

01:56.103 --> 01:58.170
"Hold this plywood."

02:00.543 --> 02:03.476
Hey, people.
Khadijah, Khadijah mail.

02:03.543 --> 02:06.843
I'm going to take a bath now.
Do not disturb. Smooches.

02:06.910 --> 02:08.842
Stop, right there, tiny woman.

02:10.009 --> 02:12.543
No, you did not
send me a chain letter.

02:13.510 --> 02:16.110
Ha! she got you, Khadijah.

02:16.176 --> 02:18.176
Ha ha ha. Here's yours.

02:20.043 --> 02:23.110
You letter giving troll.

02:23.176 --> 02:26.743
Well, Regine, chain letters
are for superstitious fools.

02:26.810 --> 02:28.276
And I ain't on of 'em.

02:28.343 --> 02:31.476
Khadijah, that's what Darla
Wilson from Des Moines said

02:31.543 --> 02:34.343
just before she lost
her house, her husband

02:34.410 --> 02:36.343
and her hair.

02:37.576 --> 02:38.876
That's awful.

02:38.943 --> 02:41.876
I know, can you imagine
losing your hair.

02:45.843 --> 02:47.810
You're not gonna mail
that thing are you?

02:47.876 --> 02:49.343
Okay, check this out,
Khadijah, alright.

02:49.410 --> 02:50.843
Bad things come in threes

02:50.910 --> 02:54.176
I've already slept with Kyle
and lost my job.

02:54.243 --> 02:57.643
I am not taking any chances that
I might sleep with Kyle again.

02:58.776 --> 03:02.150
Well, I'm gonna
live dangerously.

03:02.216 --> 03:04.483
Ow! Paper cut.

03:05.883 --> 03:07.183
Mm‐hmm.

03:07.250 --> 03:09.483
Okay, now, can we get back
to my scrapbook.

03:09.550 --> 03:11.516
Look, Regine,
a picture of me and Obie

03:11.583 --> 03:14.383
at the only hardware store
in the Bahamas.

03:14.450 --> 03:16.383
‐ Oh, is that your hotel room?
‐ Uh‐huh.

03:16.450 --> 03:18.150
Mm, single beds, huh?

03:18.216 --> 03:20.750
Must've been a drag
having to push 'em together.

03:20.816 --> 03:22.583
Oh, we didn't
push 'em together.

03:22.650 --> 03:24.916
Hey, anybody want
to make some brownies?

03:26.383 --> 03:29.216
Well, it must've been mighty
cramped with you and Overton

03:29.283 --> 03:31.216
in the same little bed.

03:31.283 --> 03:32.350
No.

03:33.883 --> 03:35.550
Okay, national healthcare

03:35.616 --> 03:39.050
now, there's an idea
who's time has come.

03:39.116 --> 03:41.150
It‐it wasn't cramped?

03:41.216 --> 03:44.183
Those beds do look a little
small. How'd y'all work that?

03:46.616 --> 03:48.783
Overton and I slept
in separate beds, okay.

03:49.716 --> 03:51.083
What?

03:52.483 --> 03:56.116
It was a romantic getaway.

03:56.183 --> 04:01.123
You two didn't do anything
a little freaky‐sneaky?

04:01.190 --> 04:03.123
[laughs]

04:08.656 --> 04:11.590
Well, okay.

04:11.656 --> 04:14.256
We did steal
those little shampoo bottles.

04:14.323 --> 04:15.890
[laughs]

04:19.523 --> 04:23.423
Okay, wait a minute.
Are‐are you saying..

04:23.490 --> 04:27.123
Are you saying that
you and Overton didn't...do it?

04:29.523 --> 04:31.456
The whole vacation?

04:33.889 --> 04:35.756
Since the vacation?

04:35.823 --> 04:37.856
Overton and I have
never done it, okay.

04:44.456 --> 04:46.890
Well, that clears up
a lot for me, aye.

04:48.523 --> 04:51.523
‐ You knew, didn't you?
‐ Of course, I knew.

04:51.590 --> 04:53.723
Regine, it's not
that big of a deal.

04:53.790 --> 04:55.256
It is to a big deal

04:55.323 --> 04:57.523
Khadijah had the juice
and didn't tell me.

04:59.523 --> 05:02.230
I'm beginning to question
our friendship.

05:02.296 --> 05:04.796
I've always questioned
our friendship.

05:04.863 --> 05:09.463
I can't believe you and Overton
never sang in the key of life.

05:12.230 --> 05:14.763
There's more to
a relationship than just sex.

05:16.030 --> 05:17.130
True.

05:18.430 --> 05:20.363
There's bitterness.

05:22.363 --> 05:25.230
There's also romance.

05:25.296 --> 05:27.930
He tells you
you're beautiful, you deny it.

05:27.996 --> 05:30.730
He insists, you deny it.
He insists with gifts..

05:30.796 --> 05:32.730
...and you agree.

05:35.730 --> 05:38.096
Well, I think
waiting is a good thing.

05:38.163 --> 05:39.830
Scooter and I waited 20 years.

05:39.896 --> 05:42.296
Oh, please, that's 'cause
y'all were just friends first.

05:42.363 --> 05:46.530
How long did you actually wait
once y'all started dating?

05:46.596 --> 05:48.663
Look, this is about Synclaire.

05:50.730 --> 05:53.430
Overton and I are waiting
until the right time.

05:53.496 --> 05:56.330
And in eight months, it ain't
never been the right time?

05:58.396 --> 06:01.003
Synclaire, now..

06:03.703 --> 06:07.403
...don't you have...desires?

06:10.736 --> 06:13.103
Of course, I do.

06:13.170 --> 06:16.236
I'd like to back pack
through New Zealand.

06:16.303 --> 06:20.470
‐ And see myself‐‐
‐ Sexual! Sexual‐ah!

06:22.936 --> 06:24.603
Desires.

06:24.670 --> 06:26.536
Just being with
Overton is enough.

06:26.603 --> 06:28.436
See, you tell him, cuz.

06:28.503 --> 06:29.703
Then there are those days

06:29.770 --> 06:31.903
I'm like a time bomb
ready to explode.

06:31.970 --> 06:34.570
Yes. Good, now,
you're dealing with the real.

06:34.636 --> 06:37.170
Truth is Obie
gives me fever.

06:38.203 --> 06:40.170
[laughs]

06:40.236 --> 06:44.203
Then I say, you two get under
the covers and sweat it out.

06:53.970 --> 06:56.570
You know, by this time
tomorrow Janet and I

06:56.636 --> 06:58.470
will be at
the Green Mountain Spa

06:58.536 --> 07:03.310
breathing fresh mountain air,
getting sweaty and feeling fit.

07:03.376 --> 07:06.176
You two goin' on
one of those nature hikes?

07:06.243 --> 07:09.243
Mm‐hmm, but, uh,
we're not leaving the room.

07:10.676 --> 07:14.276
Good. With you outta the house
I can finally buff out

07:14.343 --> 07:18.476
the scuff marks made by certain
someone trying to moonwalk

07:18.543 --> 07:20.876
across my living room floor.

07:22.243 --> 07:24.343
That dance is dead, Kyle.

07:25.710 --> 07:28.510
Even Michael's moved on.

07:28.576 --> 07:30.376
Overton, man, my leaving

07:30.443 --> 07:33.243
is your cue to romance
your woman at home alone.

07:33.310 --> 07:36.476
Look at it, shorty,
you proven time and time again

07:36.543 --> 07:40.410
you don't need a empty
apartment to have sex.

07:40.476 --> 07:44.176
When Synclaire and I are ready
to make that move, we will.

07:44.243 --> 07:46.643
Right now, we're not ready.

07:48.743 --> 07:51.410
I saw you two
in the woods today.

07:51.476 --> 07:53.143
Your ready.

07:54.610 --> 07:57.110
Hey, man, but I'm not
gonna rush things.

07:57.176 --> 07:59.810
I don't wanna mess up
what I have with Synclaire.

07:59.876 --> 08:03.583
Overton, man, getting physical
can only enhance a relationship.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.916
I know it always
makes me feel better.

08:06.983 --> 08:10.750
You don't get it. See, Synclaire
and I are like a fine wine.

08:10.816 --> 08:13.950
We waiting for this relationship
to be aged to perfection

08:14.016 --> 08:17.750
and then and only then,
will the cork be popped.

08:19.983 --> 08:22.516
So to speak.

08:22.583 --> 08:26.283
Lovely words but, uh,
riddle me this handyman.

08:26.350 --> 08:29.550
Why are you sitting here
polishing that apple

08:29.616 --> 08:31.950
when you got somebody
that can shake your tree?

08:48.116 --> 08:50.850
I see you decided to loosen up
your strict dress code.

08:50.916 --> 08:54.183
I'm gettin'
off the train, right.

08:54.250 --> 08:55.950
The doors close

08:56.016 --> 08:59.356
catch my skirt
and rip it clean off.

09:00.690 --> 09:02.723
Really, what station?

09:05.990 --> 09:08.190
Synclaire, if you're gonna mop

09:08.256 --> 09:11.023
don't you think
you should use some water?

09:11.090 --> 09:13.756
Khadijah, I'm not really
mopping, I'm thinking.

09:13.823 --> 09:17.023
I've come to a decision
about Overton and me.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.256
‐ Well, what is it?
‐ What should I do?

09:20.790 --> 09:23.390
Look, you know what to do.

09:23.456 --> 09:25.256
Yeah, you're right.

09:25.323 --> 09:27.356
What would that be?

09:28.256 --> 09:29.590
Come on, now, look.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.623
You and Overton
have been tip toeing around

09:31.690 --> 09:33.490
this subject for months.

09:33.556 --> 09:35.890
I think you should be
deciding this with Overton

09:35.956 --> 09:37.890
not with me. Okay.

09:41.190 --> 09:44.256
Regine, thank you for letting me
use your name at the spa.

09:44.323 --> 09:46.956
The manager's giving me
the best cabin in the place.

09:47.023 --> 09:49.023
‐ Not the El Dorado.
‐ Yep.

09:49.090 --> 09:52.990
And they even throwing in
a sea kelp and honey body rub.

09:53.056 --> 09:55.323
For two.

09:55.390 --> 09:58.423
Your date's gonna eat a flea dip
after a night with you.

09:58.490 --> 10:01.063
[laughs]

10:01.130 --> 10:03.096
You didn't.

10:07.230 --> 10:08.730
[laughs]

10:13.763 --> 10:16.930
What happened to you?

10:16.996 --> 10:19.363
What? Doesn't anyone
watch House of Style?

10:20.630 --> 10:23.130
Her skirt got caught
in the train door.

10:23.196 --> 10:25.630
And you wearing
that ugly slip?

10:25.696 --> 10:27.830
[laughs]

10:27.896 --> 10:30.163
It's the power of
the chain letter.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.030
It is not that chain letter.

10:33.096 --> 10:34.463
You know,
you're right, Khadijah.

10:34.530 --> 10:36.763
It's a coincidence
that I mailed my chain letter

10:36.830 --> 10:39.830
and found 20 bucks stuck
to the side of the mailbox

10:39.896 --> 10:43.163
and you threw yours in the trash
and 400 people saw your ass

10:43.230 --> 10:44.896
in the subway.

10:50.696 --> 10:52.830
Oh, hey, Synclaire.

10:52.896 --> 10:55.363
Check this out.

10:55.430 --> 10:57.096
[breathing heavily]

10:58.930 --> 11:01.036
Come to the dark side, Luke.

11:02.436 --> 11:05.770
You've been practicing.
Now, I have a surprise for you.

11:05.836 --> 11:09.570
I made this scrapbook
of our relationship.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.670
Aw, Synclaire.

11:11.736 --> 11:13.836
You saved our splinter.

11:14.970 --> 11:17.903
[kisses]

11:25.070 --> 11:28.370
‐ Obie, I've been thinking.
‐ Not me.

11:33.803 --> 11:37.170
Maybe we should take our
relationship to the next level.

11:39.703 --> 11:43.470
Next level? Uh, could
you be more specific?

11:51.136 --> 11:52.636
O‐o‐hh!

11:53.670 --> 11:56.270
Ho‐ho‐ho.
Oh, that level?

11:58.003 --> 12:00.343
You, uh, you sure
you wanna do this?

12:00.410 --> 12:01.943
Absolutely.

12:02.010 --> 12:03.743
‐ Positively?
‐ Positively.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.976
Oh, we'll set it up in here.

12:09.576 --> 12:11.510
Obie, not now.

12:12.710 --> 12:15.076
Oh, alright.

12:15.143 --> 12:17.876
I want it to be the way
we both dreamed about.

12:17.943 --> 12:19.876
Spending the night together.

12:19.943 --> 12:21.876
Waking up in
each others arms.

12:21.943 --> 12:23.876
Pretending to
smoke cigarettes.

12:25.610 --> 12:29.676
Hey, well, you know, Kyle's
goin' outta town tomorrow night.

12:29.743 --> 12:31.676
What do you say?

12:38.076 --> 12:39.210
Wow!

12:40.810 --> 12:43.376
I, God, think
you better go now.

12:43.443 --> 12:45.143
One more kiss?

12:45.210 --> 12:47.376
I'm only flesh and blood.

12:52.576 --> 12:54.710
Till tomorrow night.

12:58.976 --> 13:03.383
Man, I'm about to weld like
no man has ever welded before.

13:08.483 --> 13:11.483
Oh, come on, Synclaire, you
think just 'cause you live here

13:11.550 --> 13:13.883
you can hog the bathroom.

13:13.950 --> 13:16.450
Might have to go home
and actually use my own.

13:19.383 --> 13:20.916
What are you doing?

13:20.983 --> 13:24.150
Ah, Synclaire asked me
to do this for her scrapbook.

13:24.216 --> 13:27.283
I'm taking the before picture.

13:27.350 --> 13:28.750
You know what?

13:28.816 --> 13:30.550
Someone ought to create
a greeting card

13:30.616 --> 13:33.916
for the first time you get with
your man, know what I'm saying.

13:33.983 --> 13:36.283
They have cards
for every other occasion.

13:36.350 --> 13:37.483
Hey, how about this?

13:37.550 --> 13:39.983
Don't worry it gets better.

13:40.050 --> 13:42.183
Okay, or, alright.

13:42.250 --> 13:45.083
We knew you could do it,
we had no doubt.

13:45.150 --> 13:47.983
Now, go to your man
and wear him out.

13:48.050 --> 13:49.150

Unbelievable, I'm trying
to catch a bus

14:06.390 --> 14:10.456
'cause you know, I ain't goin'
nowhere near the subway.

14:10.523 --> 14:14.090
When the damn driver floors it
just as I get to the exhaust.

14:17.390 --> 14:20.990
Hm, I played lotto,
won 50 bucks.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.790
I'm gonna find
that chain letter.

14:27.856 --> 14:30.756
Yoo‐hoo, I'm way
ahead of you.

14:31.856 --> 14:33.790
You'll be happy
you did this.

14:33.856 --> 14:36.690
I'll be happy when
your mother receives this.

14:38.823 --> 14:41.056
Who do you think
sent it to me?

14:43.856 --> 14:46.123
Synclaire, look at you.

14:47.690 --> 14:49.556
[camera shutter releases]

14:52.556 --> 14:54.856
So, how you feeling?

14:54.923 --> 14:56.356
Feel pretty good.

14:56.423 --> 15:00.230
Except while I was upstairs
shaving my toes..

15:00.296 --> 15:01.696
...I started to worry.

15:01.763 --> 15:04.963
I‐I mean, it's been a long time,
what if I've forgotten how.

15:05.030 --> 15:08.030
Oh, no, listen, it's like,
it's like riding a bicycle

15:08.096 --> 15:10.763
over cobblestones.

15:10.830 --> 15:13.263
You never forget how
and it's kinda fun.

15:15.596 --> 15:18.163
We've been looking forward
to this for a long time.

15:18.230 --> 15:21.930
After we do it, what will we
have to look forward to?

15:21.996 --> 15:23.496
Doing it again.

15:25.930 --> 15:28.030
What if he doesn't like my body?

15:28.096 --> 15:32.630
Girl, Overton hasn't
had sex in eight months.

15:32.696 --> 15:34.630
He'll love your body.

16:06.936 --> 16:09.003
‐ For you, baby.
‐ Thank you.

16:09.070 --> 16:11.336
Ow!

16:11.403 --> 16:14.470
Oh, sorry.
Won't you come in?

16:23.336 --> 16:28.203
Well, we got champagne,
caviar, bite sized snickers.

16:29.570 --> 16:31.503
You've thought of everything.

16:37.136 --> 16:39.003
My mouth is sticking.

16:39.070 --> 16:42.603
Hmm, here, perhaps a little
champagne will help.

16:45.103 --> 16:47.836
Here, nothing like
a touch of the bubbly.

16:50.103 --> 16:51.136
Hmm.

[burps]

16:59.676 --> 17:01.976
Excuse me.

17:02.043 --> 17:04.843
Well, it's not
your fault, it's domestic.

17:09.943 --> 17:12.742
Mm, what's that
delightful scent?

17:16.443 --> 17:17.943

You're allergic
to my new perfume.

Oh, no, I'm not.
No, I'm not. Watch.

17:38.376 --> 17:40.410
I'm sorry. I'm gonna
go wash this off.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.710
Oh, no, you don't
have to do that.

Hello.

17:52.543 --> 17:54.310
Oh, hey, Kyle.

17:54.376 --> 17:57.610
No, Janet didn't call.
Thought she was with you.

17:58.776 --> 18:00.716
She went to the wrong spa?

18:01.850 --> 18:03.783
Uh, hell, I think
you're better off.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.316
She don't seem
too bright to me.

18:08.383 --> 18:09.716
Oh, Synclaire?

18:09.783 --> 18:13.083
Hm, she's in the bathroom
scrubbing her neck.

18:13.150 --> 18:16.183
It's a long story.

18:16.250 --> 18:19.716
You want me to stay on the phone
or get back to Synclaire?

18:20.950 --> 18:23.616
Well, that's just
plain selfish. Bye.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.350
That's it!
No more interruptions.

18:32.650 --> 18:35.283
You, uh, mind if I join you?

18:47.650 --> 18:52.650
Well, well, well, well,
this is some night, huh?

18:52.716 --> 18:55.016
Yep, and it's just beginning.

It's, uh..

...filled with emotion.

Yeah, I'm getting
a little emotional myself.

19:04.890 --> 19:06.523
There's passion.

19:06.590 --> 19:08.523
Oh, yeah, got the passion.

Definitely romance.

19:18.290 --> 19:20.356
Well, I know I can't wait.

19:20.423 --> 19:23.090
A paralyzing kind of anxiety.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.990
That's not good.

19:30.923 --> 19:32.190
This just doesn't feel right.

19:32.256 --> 19:35.523
I'm sitting here with a wet neck
and I'm trying not to burp

19:35.590 --> 19:38.656
and my left molar is filled
with bite sized snickers.

19:40.456 --> 19:42.890
Oh, come on, girl,
we've been far more clumsier

19:42.956 --> 19:44.490
than we've been tonight.

19:44.556 --> 19:47.290
I mean, what's really wrong?

19:47.356 --> 19:51.023
Obie, I think that
everything is going just fine

19:51.090 --> 19:54.290
and then I got this idea
somehow that having sex

19:54.356 --> 19:56.423
would make our
relationship even better.

19:56.490 --> 19:58.896
But this just doesn't
seem to be working.

20:00.196 --> 20:02.530
Maybe we should've
did it in the basement.

20:04.196 --> 20:05.963
No, that wasn't the place

20:06.030 --> 20:08.530
and maybe this
just isn't the time.

20:08.596 --> 20:11.396
I'm sorry, I really
wanted it to be.

20:11.463 --> 20:14.630
Just tonight,
just feels too forced.

20:14.696 --> 20:18.630
Hey, well, last thing
I want to do is to rush you.

20:18.696 --> 20:21.630
'Cause really, I don't
wanna have sex with you.

20:22.830 --> 20:25.096
I wanna make love to you.

Because, uh,
I love you, Synclaire.

20:34.396 --> 20:36.563
I love you too.
