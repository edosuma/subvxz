WEBVTT

00:20.575 --> 00:22.579
- Fuck. Fuck.

00:34.503 --> 00:35.705
Get 'em!

00:35.738 --> 00:37.776
- You better hide!

00:37.809 --> 00:40.314
Holy fuck,
they're gonna kill us.

00:40.347 --> 00:41.550
Fucking rednecks.

00:43.219 --> 00:44.690
Shit.

00:44.723 --> 00:46.761
Floor it!

00:51.302 --> 00:52.572
- Yeah!

00:56.547 --> 00:58.751
- Go around!

00:58.784 --> 01:00.822
- Oh, fuck.

01:07.267 --> 01:09.372
Hold up, hold up, hold up!
Stop the truck!

01:16.219 --> 01:18.156
Come on, you little shitasses!

01:18.189 --> 01:19.893
Think you can take
people's property?!

01:19.926 --> 01:21.764
Thieving fucking Indians!

01:21.797 --> 01:24.636
- We don't want
to have to shoot you.
- But we will!

01:26.439 --> 01:29.178
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here.

01:44.509 --> 01:45.879
What you want to do is
land on your back

01:45.912 --> 01:47.749
as flat as possible,
'cause if you miss it

01:47.782 --> 01:49.285
you're just gonna be
a total bitch.

01:49.318 --> 01:50.889
Yo, slow down!

01:50.922 --> 01:52.692
Those are Jackie's bros.

01:54.295 --> 01:55.732
Dude, you look
fucking sick right now.

01:55.765 --> 01:57.468
This is so cool.

01:57.502 --> 01:59.472
Sup, fuck?

01:59.506 --> 02:01.644
What's up?

02:01.677 --> 02:03.447
You guys got
any of Jackie's shit?

02:03.480 --> 02:05.184
Jackie's shit?

02:05.217 --> 02:06.721
No, she bounced on us.

02:06.754 --> 02:08.558
- So we forgot about her.
- Yeah.

02:08.591 --> 02:11.530
- Why?
- I got a <i>stvheckti</i> wizard
to put a curse on her.

02:11.563 --> 02:13.501
Now all kinds of shit's
been going down.

02:13.534 --> 02:14.903
I knew it.

02:14.936 --> 02:17.475
I told y'all bad shit
was happening to us.

02:17.509 --> 02:20.180
The other day my car
just caught on fire.

02:20.213 --> 02:22.586
Whoa... oh, shit...

02:22.619 --> 02:25.324
Oh, shit, it's gonna blow!
Oh, my God!

02:25.357 --> 02:26.594
Just like randomly.

02:26.627 --> 02:27.929
And Bone Thug Dog got shot

02:27.962 --> 02:29.499
with a little people arrow.

02:31.503 --> 02:32.973
What the fuck?

02:33.006 --> 02:35.344
<i>It's like a
regular arrow but much smaller.</i>

02:35.377 --> 02:36.814
Hell no.

02:36.847 --> 02:38.383
Like...

02:39.452 --> 02:41.757
Wait, Weeze,
what happened to you, man?

02:41.790 --> 02:43.795
Dude! My meemaw died.

02:46.032 --> 02:47.702
Ah, she was a beautiful woman.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.740
And God will look upon her

02:49.773 --> 02:52.478
as the snowflakes fall
upon her speckled cheeks.

02:52.512 --> 02:54.683
And they will sing hymns
onto her.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.687
- Aah! Oh, shit!

02:57.956 --> 02:59.526
Damn!

02:59.559 --> 03:00.762
Fuck! You okay, bro?

03:00.795 --> 03:02.431
Oh, I'm good.

03:02.464 --> 03:04.001
All right.

03:04.034 --> 03:06.339
We're in. What you need from us?

03:06.372 --> 03:07.809
Jackie's shit?

03:07.842 --> 03:11.282
Yeah, like a sock
or a fucking earring.

03:11.315 --> 03:14.756
- I got her old bandana.
- I think I have something.

03:16.994 --> 03:20.467
Heylah. Just give it
to her, White Steve.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.672
Fuck.

03:22.705 --> 03:25.678
Eyeliner.

03:25.711 --> 03:27.816
Just fucking missing her?

03:31.289 --> 03:32.424
Niblings!

03:32.457 --> 03:36.499
Hey, nice ride there, Brownie.

03:37.569 --> 03:39.472
Bucky.

03:39.506 --> 03:41.710
Been a long time.

03:41.743 --> 03:44.583
Yeah. Long time.

03:44.616 --> 03:47.956
I think the last time
you saw me,

03:47.989 --> 03:50.027
I took most of your teeth out.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.404
Oh, to rewrite history!

03:56.673 --> 03:59.680
Last time I saw you,

03:59.713 --> 04:01.316
I think I knocked you out.

04:03.319 --> 04:05.625
Oh, how easily

04:05.658 --> 04:07.394
we forget, ennit?

04:08.731 --> 04:10.467
Can you guys settle down?

04:10.501 --> 04:13.006
Fuck! We got curses to break.

04:13.039 --> 04:14.643
Tomorrow morning,

04:14.676 --> 04:16.346
we head to the river.

04:16.379 --> 04:18.584
That right, Bucky?

04:23.059 --> 04:25.832
Yeah, yeah, he's right.

04:25.865 --> 04:28.537
Damn right I'm right!

04:32.912 --> 04:34.950
Hey, what's up, Care Bear?

04:34.983 --> 04:36.554
With the mean stare.

04:36.587 --> 04:38.456
What's up, fellas?

04:38.489 --> 04:40.728
Why you walking around
like you was at IHS all day?

04:40.761 --> 04:42.766
- What?
- Yeah, like you about to cry.

04:42.799 --> 04:44.836
Man, I ain't about to cry, bro.

04:44.869 --> 04:47.509
Uh, where...
where's the gang at?

04:47.542 --> 04:49.780
I ain't got a gang, bro.

04:49.813 --> 04:51.850
What? The Reservation Dogs.

04:51.883 --> 04:53.521
- Yeah.
- Where's Elora?

04:53.554 --> 04:55.123
Yeah, well, she ran off
with Jackie, man.

04:55.156 --> 04:57.127
Fucking left me
in the trenches, shit.

04:57.160 --> 04:59.065
Oof. Hard to lose the leader.

04:59.098 --> 05:01.402
She ain't the leader.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.708
Sound like stuff is
falling apart for you.

05:03.741 --> 05:06.513
Hey, what about second
in command, Willie Jack?

05:06.546 --> 05:08.784
Man, she's off
doing kid shit, bro.

05:08.817 --> 05:10.020
They all are.

05:10.053 --> 05:11.624
- Hmm.
- Hey, hey.

05:11.657 --> 05:13.059
What's up?

05:13.092 --> 05:15.632
Do y'all know anyone
who's hiring?

05:15.665 --> 05:17.401
Like a job?

05:17.434 --> 05:18.671
Hey, we're hiring.

05:18.704 --> 05:20.140
We need social media, promo,

05:20.173 --> 05:21.844
graphics, all that.

05:21.877 --> 05:23.648
How much y'all pay?

05:23.681 --> 05:25.685
It's for the exposure.

05:25.718 --> 05:27.956
Yeah, and once we hit,
we're gonna be rich.

05:27.989 --> 05:30.728
- And we're gonna make it
rain, shawty, rain, shawty.
- Rain! Hey, for real!

05:30.761 --> 05:32.431
Tell your moms
I said what's up, though.

05:32.464 --> 05:34.468
- Your loss.
- Hey, write that down.

05:38.476 --> 05:40.380
- I like that.
It's gonna be a hit.
- Yeah.

06:01.455 --> 06:03.594
Chickens.

06:03.627 --> 06:05.999
Where there's chickens,
there's eggs.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.169
I'm so fucking hungry.

06:08.202 --> 06:11.042
Wait.
We'll wait till after dark.

06:11.075 --> 06:13.113
Then we'll steal some.

06:13.146 --> 06:15.818
- Okay?
- Okay.

06:38.196 --> 06:40.466
Eagle.

06:41.703 --> 06:44.008
It's a good sign.

06:46.245 --> 06:48.449
I think that's a buzzard.

06:51.757 --> 06:53.794
Great.

07:08.156 --> 07:10.159
Daniel.

07:11.763 --> 07:13.767
What's wrong?

07:17.809 --> 07:19.846
Hey.

07:19.879 --> 07:21.583
Hey, hi, no.

07:21.616 --> 07:22.919
It's okay, it's okay.

07:22.952 --> 07:25.658
Uh, was just checking on you.

07:25.691 --> 07:28.129
I just saw you up here.
I was gonna see

07:28.162 --> 07:30.167
if you want to come
to the house and eat.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.906
I mean, you can

07:32.939 --> 07:34.943
stay out here.
It's nice out, but....

07:34.976 --> 07:37.247
I got food and an empty house.

07:40.186 --> 07:42.490
Yeah? Come on.

07:43.927 --> 07:46.834
Hey, hi.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.904
I'm Anna.

07:50.708 --> 07:52.512
I'm Mariah.

07:52.545 --> 07:54.048
Hi, Mariah.

07:54.081 --> 07:56.653
I'm Carrie.

07:56.686 --> 07:58.657
Carrie?

07:58.690 --> 08:00.962
It's like Mariah Carey.

08:00.995 --> 08:03.233
Well, that's probably
before y'all's time, but...

08:03.266 --> 08:04.836
<i>Big empty house.</i>

08:04.869 --> 08:07.976
My-my husband left me, so...

08:08.009 --> 08:09.780
don't get married.

08:09.813 --> 08:11.950
Uh, listen, um...

08:11.983 --> 08:14.856
dinner's gonna be a minute,
so you guys can take a shower

08:14.889 --> 08:16.960
or throw your clothes
in the wash or...

08:16.993 --> 08:18.864
I don't know,
whatever you want to do.

08:18.897 --> 08:20.934
And, uh, you know,
just make yourself at home.

08:44.148 --> 08:46.620
Hmm.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.866
Everyone looks happy.

08:52.899 --> 08:55.337
Hmm, yeah, we were-- or are.

08:55.370 --> 08:58.143
Uh, I don't know, some of us.

08:58.176 --> 09:00.882
Very weird getting
a divorce at my age.

09:00.915 --> 09:03.019
I mean, to be starting over.

09:03.052 --> 09:05.056
My kids are off at college.

09:08.029 --> 09:11.703
Uh... are you girls
running away?

09:13.306 --> 09:15.277
Yeah.

09:15.310 --> 09:17.181
Oh, I knew it.

09:19.819 --> 09:21.924
Damn it, I'm so jealous.

09:21.957 --> 09:24.395
I always wanted to run away.

09:24.428 --> 09:28.102
Hmm, never too late.

09:28.135 --> 09:30.708
Maybe I'll go with you.

09:30.741 --> 09:33.781
I'll pay for gas.

09:33.814 --> 09:35.884
But, I mean, really...

09:37.889 --> 09:39.959
...I would go.

09:43.099 --> 09:45.872
I'm still not used
to cooking for one person.

09:45.905 --> 09:47.040
All right.

09:47.073 --> 09:49.813
Maybe someday.

09:49.846 --> 09:52.351
It's okay. We appreciate it.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.321
That is my famous

09:54.354 --> 09:56.359
spaghetti taco casserole.

09:56.392 --> 09:58.363
Flavors of old Italy

09:58.396 --> 10:01.068
with a little bit of that
"south of the border" kick.

10:03.206 --> 10:05.611
You mind if I pray?

10:07.848 --> 10:09.886
That's fine.

10:27.989 --> 10:30.327
Oh, your most heavenly
gracious father,

10:30.360 --> 10:33.333
thank you for blessing us
with another day.

10:33.366 --> 10:36.372
Thank you for the food on the
table that you have provided

10:36.405 --> 10:39.245
and the air in our lungs.
I'd like to ask

10:39.278 --> 10:41.850
for your guidance and
protective hands to be placed

10:41.883 --> 10:44.455
over Mariah and Carrie

10:44.488 --> 10:46.259
as they proceed
on their journey.

10:46.292 --> 10:48.463
Boy, they're gonna need
a little help.

10:48.496 --> 10:51.469
Don't we all, as ladies?

10:51.503 --> 10:53.206
Mm-hmm.

10:53.239 --> 10:55.210
I'd like you to keep 'em
away from men

10:55.243 --> 10:56.980
who might want
to take advantage of them,

10:57.013 --> 10:59.084
which basically is,

10:59.117 --> 11:01.289
you know, men in general.

11:01.322 --> 11:04.495
Because, as you know,
sometimes men

11:04.529 --> 11:07.100
don't treat women as equals.

11:07.133 --> 11:09.104
Or fairly.

11:09.137 --> 11:11.977
Please help me to finish
my Gloria Steinem book.

11:12.010 --> 11:14.348
It's a long slog. If I read

11:14.381 --> 11:17.020
even just a page a night
before I fall asleep,

11:17.053 --> 11:19.291
that's all I ask, all right.

11:19.324 --> 11:22.264
We are all precious in your
eyes, except for my husband.

11:22.297 --> 11:24.502
He's a shitass.

11:24.535 --> 11:27.775
I pray that you give him
a little comeuppance perhaps.

11:27.808 --> 11:30.781
Nothing crazy. Don't want you
to hurt him, but...

11:30.814 --> 11:32.417
you know,
if you could just bring

11:32.450 --> 11:34.889
a little woe into his life

11:34.922 --> 11:37.795
and into Joanne's,
I think that...

11:37.828 --> 11:40.232
we would all be better for it.

11:43.272 --> 11:45.043
In your most holy, precious,

11:45.076 --> 11:47.447
blessed... perfect

11:47.480 --> 11:50.788
long-suffering
and glorious name.

11:50.821 --> 11:52.792
Thank you for Gloria Steinem.
Amen.

11:52.825 --> 11:55.196
- All right.
- Amen.

11:55.229 --> 11:57.267
- Ooh, that was a good one, gosh.
- Amen.

11:57.300 --> 12:00.808
Did you feel that? I felt
the energy or, uh, the--

12:00.841 --> 12:04.148
it was like the air was,
was vibrating almost.

12:04.181 --> 12:06.085
I don't even know what that was.
That was...

12:06.118 --> 12:08.957
that was kind of spooky. Ooh!

12:08.990 --> 12:11.162
I had a dream like that once.

12:11.195 --> 12:13.299
I woke up and...

12:13.332 --> 12:15.437
then I went to the bathroom
and I threw up.

12:15.470 --> 12:17.441
Help yourself.

12:17.474 --> 12:20.013
- Okay.
- Yeah, dig in, please.

12:20.046 --> 12:21.817
Could you pass the rolls
and the ranch dressing?

12:21.850 --> 12:23.554
Those are good together.
Have you tried it?

12:23.587 --> 12:25.958
'Cause that's
kind of all I'm gonna have.

12:25.991 --> 12:28.462
Yeah, it's a bad habit
I've gotten into.

12:29.398 --> 12:31.369
Yeah, since Ed left,

12:31.402 --> 12:33.172
it's like, who cares anymore?

12:33.205 --> 12:35.176
It's just all carbs
all the time.

12:35.209 --> 12:38.148
There's so much sour cream
in there, you would not believe.

12:39.117 --> 12:40.988
Now really eat up.

12:41.021 --> 12:43.861
Ah, it's so good.

12:43.894 --> 12:46.265
Oh, I'm almost out.

12:46.298 --> 12:47.502
You don't want to see
what happens

12:47.535 --> 12:49.304
when I run out
of ranch dressing.

15:11.021 --> 15:12.992
<i>Daniel?</i>

15:15.029 --> 15:17.200
What's wrong?

15:18.369 --> 15:21.475
Why didn't you take me
to California?

15:25.383 --> 15:27.420
Elora?

15:27.453 --> 15:30.059
Why didn't you take me with you?

15:36.773 --> 15:38.977
Shh.

16:02.056 --> 16:04.127
Those little sluts.

16:15.584 --> 16:17.621
Do you feel bad?

16:18.757 --> 16:21.361
About stealing her truck?

16:22.564 --> 16:25.036
For everything.

16:25.069 --> 16:27.306
Everyone was just trying
to help us.

16:29.311 --> 16:31.314
I don't feel bad about shit.

16:32.350 --> 16:34.187
Fuck this truck.

16:34.220 --> 16:36.760
That lady seemed happy.

16:36.793 --> 16:38.764
Big-ass house,
middle of nowhere,

16:38.797 --> 16:41.802
no one else around,
talks to God and shit.

16:43.439 --> 16:45.442
Take that any day.

16:47.748 --> 16:50.086
Yeah, we have to sing a song.

16:50.119 --> 16:52.758
But first we, we must pray

16:52.791 --> 16:54.829
and be humble to Creator.

16:54.862 --> 16:56.298
Mm.

16:57.467 --> 16:59.337
Creator.

17:00.373 --> 17:02.778
I pray you take pity
upon these kids.

17:02.811 --> 17:05.517
They did something
they ain't proud of.

17:05.550 --> 17:07.454
Help them right now.

17:07.487 --> 17:09.257
Let this water here

17:09.290 --> 17:12.263
wash away all that bad medicine.

17:12.296 --> 17:13.800
Heal our pain, Creator!

17:13.833 --> 17:15.336
Mm.

17:15.369 --> 17:16.706
I'd also like to pray

17:16.739 --> 17:19.746
for all those relatives
out there.

17:19.779 --> 17:23.520
Those ones going
through relationship troubles,

17:23.553 --> 17:25.624
wherever they are.

17:27.828 --> 17:30.400
They should know and understand

17:30.433 --> 17:33.272
that they were broken up
when their friend

17:33.305 --> 17:35.811
slept with their girlfriend
at that time.

17:35.844 --> 17:38.382
And they shouldn't hold
any grudges,

17:38.415 --> 17:41.155
in that good way,
Creator, like that.

17:41.188 --> 17:44.227
Creator, my heart feels good

17:44.260 --> 17:46.666
to teach these young ones

17:46.699 --> 17:49.137
how to move on

17:49.170 --> 17:52.644
and to put this curse
behind them.

17:54.414 --> 17:57.220
And maybe there is something

17:57.253 --> 17:59.826
in here for us older ones,

17:59.859 --> 18:02.130
like...

18:02.163 --> 18:04.802
you should not sleep
with your buddy's old lady

18:04.835 --> 18:08.242
while they're broke up
'cause there's a good

18:08.275 --> 18:11.583
chance they will get back
together again like we did.

18:11.616 --> 18:14.321
<i>Mvto, mvto, mvto!</i> Understood,

18:14.354 --> 18:16.726
Creator, understood.

18:16.759 --> 18:19.599
Thank you, Creator,
for helping me

18:19.632 --> 18:21.569
to be more aware

18:21.602 --> 18:24.307
of other people's
emotions and...

18:24.340 --> 18:26.713
- I'm a flawed man!
- Mm.

18:26.746 --> 18:29.284
I'm prone to impulse

18:29.317 --> 18:32.457
and lustfulness,
and for that I am sorry.

18:32.490 --> 18:35.731
Creator, I can't help it.

18:35.764 --> 18:38.335
I like the feel of a woman...

18:38.368 --> 18:40.440
Creator!

18:40.473 --> 18:43.279
Thank you, Creator, for...

18:43.312 --> 18:46.553
giving me the ability to forgive

18:46.586 --> 18:48.489
past transgressions

18:48.523 --> 18:53.299
and to look past
other people's shortcomings.

18:53.332 --> 18:56.338
Well, Creator, they ain't
that short, my coming.

18:56.371 --> 18:58.309
<i>- Aho!
- Aho!</i>

18:58.342 --> 18:59.746
<i>- Aho.</i>
- Amen!

18:59.779 --> 19:03.754
A... amen!

19:03.787 --> 19:04.889
Amen!

19:04.922 --> 19:07.828
Wow, strong prayer.

19:09.665 --> 19:11.435
Real strong.

19:11.468 --> 19:12.905
Come on, you kids.

19:12.938 --> 19:15.543
Fuck was that?

19:16.913 --> 19:20.219
These elders have lived
very complicated lives.

19:20.252 --> 19:23.627
Now we sing a song.

19:23.660 --> 19:25.463
What song should we sing?

19:25.496 --> 19:27.467
Uh...

19:27.500 --> 19:29.772
- an old song.
- Yeah.

19:29.805 --> 19:32.511
An old one.

19:32.544 --> 19:35.450
And then the water
will just take it away.

19:35.483 --> 19:37.486
Yeah.

19:54.822 --> 19:56.826
Fuck, I know this song
better than these guys.

19:56.859 --> 19:58.262
It goes, uh...

20:51.636 --> 20:53.940
It-It's not even
that old of a song.

20:56.011 --> 20:58.082
It's like 30 years.

20:58.115 --> 21:00.319
That's old.

21:01.923 --> 21:03.492
Is the curse gone?

21:03.526 --> 21:05.831
<i>Aho,</i> old warrior!

21:05.864 --> 21:07.568
- What's he waving at?

21:07.601 --> 21:09.471
You tell them,
you tell the little bastards

21:09.505 --> 21:12.845
there that this most sacredest
of ceremonies is complete.

21:12.878 --> 21:15.316
That in that red road good way,

21:15.349 --> 21:17.320
cedar path corn pollen way,

21:17.353 --> 21:19.759
that sun dance, stomp dance,
smoke dance, longhouse,

21:19.792 --> 21:22.463
Episcopal way that they,

21:22.496 --> 21:24.769
the little fuckers
of the seventh generation,

21:24.802 --> 21:27.508
have vanquished
this most powerful of curses.

21:27.541 --> 21:30.046
- Can we go now?
- But the effects of it

21:30.079 --> 21:32.050
will linger on in their hearts

21:32.083 --> 21:33.887
until they deal
with the guilt inside.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.524
You tell them that!

21:35.557 --> 21:36.859
Tell them to be good relatives,

21:36.892 --> 21:38.663
take care of each other
in that way.

21:38.696 --> 21:40.734
Uh, yeah.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.504
It's gone.

21:42.537 --> 21:45.510
But you kids got
to stop being shitasses.

21:45.543 --> 21:47.079
Yeah.

21:48.048 --> 21:50.754
Ah, close enough.

22:02.644 --> 22:05.517
How can one man eat
so much catfish?

22:05.550 --> 22:08.757
- It's amazing.
- Catfish is life, I guess.

22:08.790 --> 22:10.627
Yeah, it is.

22:10.660 --> 22:12.564
Mm-hmm. Mm!

22:12.597 --> 22:14.769
You two should give me a job,
I mean,

22:14.802 --> 22:16.539
because of how much catfish
I buy. We could have, like,

22:16.572 --> 22:19.512
Rob, Cleo and Bear's.
That flows right, right?

22:19.545 --> 22:21.148
Yeah, yeah, no.

22:21.181 --> 22:23.085
I don't think so,
'cause with all the candy

22:23.118 --> 22:25.089
that Cheese has stolen,
not to mention

22:25.122 --> 22:27.695
all the steaks that you and the
rest of the gang have stolen?

22:27.728 --> 22:29.966
Yeah, I saw that.
I think we broke even.

22:29.999 --> 22:33.439
Matter of fact, you should
volunteer here once a week.

22:33.472 --> 22:35.810
- That's not a bad idea.

22:36.746 --> 22:38.850
Oh, Mississippi Miles.

22:38.883 --> 22:40.620
- Don't get up.

22:42.123 --> 22:43.827
I'm gonna grab a cup
before I offload these.

22:43.860 --> 22:45.731
Freshly brewed.

22:45.764 --> 22:48.002
Like I like it!

22:48.035 --> 22:49.772
What's the matter, Bear?

22:49.805 --> 22:52.476
What are you afraid of?

22:56.719 --> 22:59.090
Looking for work, huh?

23:00.125 --> 23:03.132
Yeah, looking for something.

23:03.165 --> 23:05.436
Yeah, I been there.

23:05.469 --> 23:07.507
Find anything yet?

23:14.053 --> 23:17.827
I know it was you and your
friends that stole the truck.

23:19.030 --> 23:20.901
I didn't, uh...

23:20.934 --> 23:23.138
I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:23.171 --> 23:25.009
Insurance covered the truck,
and I got

23:25.042 --> 23:27.948
to keep my job and my foot.

23:27.981 --> 23:31.588
We don't need
no more young folk in jail.

23:33.626 --> 23:35.630
It's easy to tear things down

23:35.663 --> 23:37.734
but a lot harder
to build 'em up.

23:38.936 --> 23:41.642
Consider this
your one big break.

23:41.675 --> 23:44.047
'Cause at the snap of a finger,

23:44.080 --> 23:47.086
your life could have taken
a big turn.

23:50.894 --> 23:52.598
Build things, boy.

23:52.631 --> 23:55.135
Don't tear 'em down.

23:57.641 --> 24:00.012
Thank you for not turning us in.

24:00.045 --> 24:02.016
Wasn't just me.

24:02.049 --> 24:03.953
Thank Rob and Cleo, too.

24:04.955 --> 24:07.895
They got y'all dumb asses
on video doing the whole thing.

24:07.928 --> 24:09.765
Rob posted it on Facebooks.

24:09.798 --> 24:11.669
We must've played it back about,

24:11.702 --> 24:13.205
- what, ten, 20 times?
- Yeah.

24:13.238 --> 24:15.777
Can't even drive the truck.
We found chips

24:15.810 --> 24:18.015
for two blocks.

24:18.048 --> 24:21.021
Barbecue, sour cream,

24:21.054 --> 24:23.225
flaming-- my favorite ones.

24:23.258 --> 24:26.833
It's not the flavor, we're just
trying to teach him a lesson.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.202
Just don't steal in general.

24:28.235 --> 24:29.805
Dummy.

24:31.976 --> 24:34.013
I'm gonna finish my coffee.

24:34.046 --> 24:37.286
And you need to help me unload
the truck as a thank you.

24:37.319 --> 24:39.524
Yes, sir.

24:56.759 --> 25:00.065
Look what the fucking cat
drug in.

25:02.002 --> 25:04.307
Looks like y'all been
scrapping around.

25:04.340 --> 25:07.113
What's good, Johnny Boy?

25:07.146 --> 25:08.850
Same shit.

25:08.883 --> 25:10.587
Think I was sitting here
when you left.

25:10.620 --> 25:12.558
You were.

25:12.591 --> 25:14.662
This is my friend Elora Danan.

25:14.695 --> 25:16.098
Sup?

25:16.131 --> 25:17.601
I love <i>Willow.</i>

25:17.634 --> 25:19.738
Little-ass brownies,
little people.

25:19.771 --> 25:22.677
- Fucking Madmartigan. Shit.
- Sup?

25:23.913 --> 25:26.084
- She still in there?
- Yep.

25:26.117 --> 25:27.319
Same spot.

25:30.192 --> 25:31.862
You can come in.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.004
Where the fuck did
the truck come from?

25:36.037 --> 25:37.875
The truck store.

25:37.908 --> 25:39.144
Yeah, right.

25:39.177 --> 25:41.616
This looks
like a white man's truck.

25:51.134 --> 25:53.706
Mom.

25:56.311 --> 25:58.816
Mom, it's Jackie.

26:04.060 --> 26:06.933
I was watching TV.

26:06.966 --> 26:08.636
Wait.

26:08.669 --> 26:10.907
- Did Bev kick you out?
- No.

26:10.940 --> 26:12.176
Just passing through.

26:12.209 --> 26:14.147
Oh, good.

26:14.180 --> 26:16.885
Where's my cigarettes?

26:27.941 --> 26:30.913
Can I borrow some gas money?

26:33.986 --> 26:35.957
I can give you 20.

26:35.990 --> 26:37.727
Give me my purse.

26:56.264 --> 26:58.301
That's all I got.

27:00.740 --> 27:02.811
Thanks.

27:02.844 --> 27:05.148
I'm gonna get going.

27:06.417 --> 27:08.154
Okay.

27:10.860 --> 27:14.000
Give that place a chance.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.636
You need it.

27:20.747 --> 27:23.385
You see it, huh? Just
"Johnny Boy" right on the back.

27:23.418 --> 27:25.924
-Flush.
- Hey, Johnny Boy.

27:25.957 --> 27:27.393
Huh?

27:27.426 --> 27:29.264
Need your help.

27:29.297 --> 27:31.334
My help? With what?

27:31.367 --> 27:33.973
You got a chain to pull a car?

27:37.914 --> 27:42.189
<i>After that, bro,
we just left it up to Creator.</i>

27:45.295 --> 27:46.832
Y'all hiring?

27:46.865 --> 27:48.736
Oh, I'm gonna hire
your thieving ass.

27:48.769 --> 27:51.274
<i>And we just hope
that the curse is lifted</i>

27:51.307 --> 27:53.344
<i>and that things get better.</i>

28:00.893 --> 28:04.000
<i>But to be honest,</i>

28:04.033 --> 28:07.507
<i>it just doesn't feel
like it's over.</i>

28:10.078 --> 28:11.749
<i>Wish you were here.</i>

28:11.782 --> 28:15.255
You'd get it all
straightened out.

28:16.224 --> 28:18.195
Love you, bitch.
