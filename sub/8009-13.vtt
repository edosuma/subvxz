00:11.999 --> 00:13.999
I got the Victoria's
Secret Fashion Show.

00:13.999 --> 00:15.999
- Oh, my God.
- Maybe you should

00:15.999 --> 00:17.999
come.
To have my whole family sitting

00:17.999 --> 00:20.999
there-- it's a media frenzy.
I'm just trying to be

00:20.999 --> 00:22.999
professional and not have to
worry about anything else.

00:22.999 --> 00:26.999
- No! You can't. You can't come.
- Kendall is pissed.

00:26.999 --> 00:28.999
I've already been
disinvited.

00:28.999 --> 00:31.999
I'm going to
therapy today with Scott, at the

00:31.999 --> 00:33.999
rehab place.
I hate doing that kind of stuff.

00:33.999 --> 00:36.999
I know nothing's gonna change
overnight, but who knows what

00:36.999 --> 00:40.999
- next week will bring?
- Happy birthday!

00:40.999 --> 00:42.999
- Incredible!
- He's improving little

00:42.999 --> 00:45.999
by little, and that's all that
matters.

00:45.999 --> 00:47.999
I have been asked about Lamar 40
times.

00:47.999 --> 00:49.999
It's hard; it's tough.

Alexa, who is Kourtney
Kardashian?

01:11.999 --> 01:14.999
Kourtney Mary
Kardashian is an American

01:14.999 --> 01:16.999
- television personality...
- Oh!

01:16.999 --> 01:18.999
...fashion designer

Alexa, what do you do
when your water breaks?

01:28.999 --> 01:31.999
I didn't understand
the question I heard.

01:31.999 --> 01:33.000
Well, then, you're
dumb.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.999

Alexia, how far away is
Cedars-Sinai from here?

01:38.999 --> 01:42.999
63.5 miles away on N.
Robertson Boulevard.

01:42.999 --> 01:44.999
I used to hear
stories all the time, like,

01:44.999 --> 01:46.999
people couldn't make it, so
they'd give birth on the front

01:46.999 --> 01:48.999
lawn of, like, some random
person's house.

01:48.999 --> 01:50.999
I know, I've heard all
those stories, too.

01:50.999 --> 01:52.999
No, we have to time
it.

01:52.999 --> 01:54.999
Or she's gonna give birth in the
car.

01:54.999 --> 01:56.999
All right, let's go!
We kind of got to be in a rush,

01:56.999 --> 01:58.999
that's how it's gotta be.
Yeah, I know, let's go.

01:58.999 --> 01:59.999
- We gotta go.
- We don't have time

01:59.999 --> 02:01.999
- to chill like this, you see?
- It's got to  happen.

02:01.999 --> 02:03.999
Let's do this.
Come on, Kim!

02:03.999 --> 02:05.999

- Shut up.

explain the anxiety that you

have when you just don't know
when you're going to go into

02:11.999 --> 02:14.000
labor.
They always say your second baby

02:14.000 --> 02:17.999
comes quicker, so I just... I
hope I make it there in time.

02:17.999 --> 02:20.999
So I just want to time it out,
like, from Calabasas to the

02:20.999 --> 02:24.999

10:20.999 --> 10:22.999
anything in until the lights are
done.

10:22.999 --> 10:26.999
Hey.

10:26.999 --> 10:28.999
You and I are having an
emergency meeting tomorrow.

10:28.999 --> 10:31.999
- Okay.
- I told my mom to go look

10:31.999 --> 10:32.999
at the house, and she, like,
looked at it and said, "You're

10:32.999 --> 10:36.999
not moving in until next July."
I can't, like, I just, I can't

10:36.999 --> 10:38.999
live like this.
I can't live in my mom's house

10:38.999 --> 10:41.999
anymore.
And if there's another team that

10:41.999 --> 10:45.999
I have to hire to pay to open up
the walls, we'll do that.

10:45.999 --> 10:47.999
Just tell me who you think that
is.

10:47.999 --> 10:49.999
The main problem
is, Kim, I could get 1,000 guys

10:49.999 --> 10:51.999
in there.
I just don't have the materials.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.999
You know, I don't have the
lights.

10:53.999 --> 10:57.999
But I specifically said
if the lighting will hold

10:57.999 --> 10:59.999
anything up, we don't have to
do it.

10:59.999 --> 11:02.999
All right, let's
talk, see what you're willing to

11:02.999 --> 11:04.999
- not do.
- I'm gonna write everyone

11:04.999 --> 11:06.999
an e-mail.
- All right, let's

11:06.999 --> 11:08.999
move on and we'll talk tomorrow
and see what we can do.

11:08.999 --> 11:11.999
Okay, bye.
My construction is delayed

11:11.999 --> 11:14.999
again.
I really, really, really wanted

11:14.999 --> 11:18.999
to be in my house when I have
the baby.

11:18.999 --> 11:22.999
It's just so overwhelming.
How should I start off this

11:22.999 --> 11:25.999
- e-mail?
- "This is beyond  up.

11:25.999 --> 11:31.999
This is so not fair
to do to me

11:31.999 --> 11:35.999
and my family."
I am just kind of

11:35.999 --> 11:37.999
annoyed with the Victoria's
Secret situation.

11:37.999 --> 11:39.999
I wasn't allowed to the
after party, nothing.

11:39.999 --> 11:43.999
Everyone thinks I'm the jealous
sister.

11:43.999 --> 11:46.999
Why's your house
not ready still?

11:46.999 --> 11:48.999
What's going on?
Your clothes are in a garage

11:48.999 --> 11:50.999
right now.
Another baby in that house, it's

11:50.999 --> 11:54.999
- gonna be crazy.
- Oh!

11:54.999 --> 11:57.999
Scotty!
Oh, my God!

11:57.999 --> 12:00.999
I don't want to end
up in the same situation that I

12:00.999 --> 12:02.000
just got out of.

12:13.999 --> 12:16.999
I'm so glad I don't

12:16.999 --> 12:19.999
have pets.
I can't even tell you.

12:19.999 --> 12:21.999
Ew.

12:21.999 --> 12:24.999
You guys, I'm not into dogs.
Literally.

12:24.999 --> 12:29.999
I just found out that Khloe's
doing a post about me saying the

12:29.999 --> 12:31.999
word "literally."

12:31.999 --> 12:34.999
I think from hanging out with
you a lot, I've been saying the

12:34.999 --> 12:37.999
word more than I normally do,
which I normally say it a lot.

12:37.999 --> 12:39.999
- Yeah.
- I feel like I'm

12:39.999 --> 12:41.999
- saying it even more.
- I say it a lot.

12:41.999 --> 12:44.999
Just life.
So, I'm gonna go to Australia

12:44.999 --> 12:46.999
- with Kendall.
- Yeah.

12:46.999 --> 12:49.999
Because our clothing
line is launching.

12:49.999 --> 12:52.999
- Well, that's fun.
- Yeah, it's pretty

12:52.999 --> 12:56.999
cool, but I am just kind of
annoyed with the Victoria's

12:56.999 --> 12:58.999
- Secret situation.
- Why?

12:58.999 --> 12:59.999
And how she didn't,
like, want us to come or

12:59.999 --> 13:01.999
whatever.
But everyone thinks I'm the

13:01.999 --> 13:05.999
jealous sister.
And I didn't show up because I

13:05.999 --> 13:09.999
was so jealous.
Kendall didn't really want

13:09.999 --> 13:12.999
anyone else to have attention on
the biggest night of her life,

13:12.999 --> 13:15.999
which I totally understand, but
I feel like we're all, like,

13:15.999 --> 13:17.999
kind of known for, like,
supporting each other.

13:17.999 --> 13:19.999
And now I feel like it almost
backfired, and now it's like

13:19.999 --> 13:22.999
more attention on me that I
didn't go.

13:22.999 --> 13:26.999
So I just feel like people are
kind of blowing this up.

13:26.999 --> 13:28.999
We should just support each
other and not worry.

13:28.999 --> 13:31.999
'Cause if I, that was me, I
would say, "Yeah, sure, come."

13:31.999 --> 13:33.999
I think you should
talk to her for sure.

13:33.999 --> 13:37.999
Maybe just say that your
feelings are hurt and that,

13:37.999 --> 13:39.999
like, you really wish you
could've been there to support

13:39.999 --> 13:41.000
- her.
- Yeah.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.999
I mean, it's hard
to not care, but I feel like,

13:45.999 --> 13:59.999
you know, just try your best.♪ ♪

13:59.999 --> 14:01.999
Hello.

14:01.999 --> 14:03.999
- Where have you been?
- I have been a huge

14:03.999 --> 14:08.000
whale, roaming around town.
So, I went to the doctor today.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.999
- Yeah?
- And the baby already is

14:10.999 --> 14:13.999
seven pounds, which is, like,
unheard of.

14:13.999 --> 14:16.999
- It's supposed to be four.
- Super baby?

14:16.999 --> 14:19.999
Like, really healthy.
Just, like, a big baby.

14:19.999 --> 14:21.999
Why is your house
not ready still?

14:21.999 --> 14:23.999
What's going on?
What are you gonna do?

14:23.999 --> 14:25.999
What about the other house?
Why don't you guys move in there

14:25.999 --> 14:28.999
- temporarily? Like, what's...
- Like, we're gonna be

14:28.999 --> 14:32.999
showing the house, so it's like,
do we want that?

14:32.999 --> 14:34.999
People in and out while we're
living there?

14:34.999 --> 14:36.999
You can't be in
your mom's for, like, six more

14:36.999 --> 14:37.999
- months.
- I know.

14:37.999 --> 14:40.999
- That's crazy.
- Our Bel Air house is

14:40.999 --> 14:42.999
done, so I have the option to
move into that.

14:42.999 --> 14:46.999
This house was the reason why we
had to move into my mom's the

14:46.999 --> 14:49.999
first time, but I want to sell
our Bel Air house.

14:49.999 --> 14:51.999
So I, you know, I want that to
be available for people to come

14:51.999 --> 14:54.999
look at it, and with a new baby,
I just don't know if that's the

14:54.999 --> 14:57.999
- best decision to move into it.
- It's more

14:57.999 --> 14:59.999
convenient for you, the kids.
Like, it's fine.

14:59.999 --> 15:02.999
- And it's temporary.
- The only thing is, I

15:02.999 --> 15:04.999
- never installed the closets.
- Your clothes are in

15:04.999 --> 15:07.999
a garage right now.
Who cares?

15:07.999 --> 15:09.999
You have to understand, another
baby in that house, it's gonna

15:09.999 --> 15:12.999
be crazy.
You need to make, like, a hard

15:12.999 --> 15:15.999
decision on it, and, like, do
it.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.999
Welcome to Regatta,
everyone.

15:34.999 --> 15:37.999
Thank you for being here today
for the Kendall + Kylie

15:37.999 --> 15:41.999
Collection at Forever New.
Can you please put your hands

15:41.999 --> 15:43.999
together and welcome Kendall and
Kylie Jenner.

15:43.999 --> 15:46.999
I'm in Australia with

15:46.999 --> 15:50.999
Kendall, and our line has
finally launched here, so it's

15:50.999 --> 15:54.999
really exciting, but I also do
want to see Australia and would

15:54.999 --> 15:57.999
- love to explore it.
- Welcome to

15:57.999 --> 15:58.999
Australia.
It's an absolute pleasure to

15:58.999 --> 16:00.999
- have you.
- We're excited to be

16:00.999 --> 16:01.999
here.
It's my second time, her first

16:01.999 --> 16:02.999
- time.
- My first time.

16:02.999 --> 16:05.999
Now, you guys did a
collaboration with Forever New,

16:05.999 --> 16:07.999
and you guys designed the
collection.

16:07.999 --> 16:09.999
- So tell me about that process.
- Yeah, I think that,

16:09.999 --> 16:13.999
uh, this collection was kind of
our first more mature collection

16:13.999 --> 16:16.000
than stuff we've done in the
past, so I think it was

16:16.000 --> 16:17.999
something that we really put a
lot of effort into.

16:17.999 --> 16:19.999
More mature, and,
like, high-end.

16:19.999 --> 16:21.999
Now, I have to ask
you about your show last week.

16:21.999 --> 16:23.999
I mean, you must have been so
proud of your sister doing the

16:23.999 --> 16:26.999
- Victoria's Secret Show.
- So proud of her.

16:26.999 --> 16:28.999
Tell me how that
whole experience was.

16:28.999 --> 16:30.999
I mean, I've
literally wanted to do it since

16:30.999 --> 16:32.999
before I can remember, and,
like, my dad saw the show and

16:32.999 --> 16:35.999
afterwards, like, made me cry,
'cause she was crying.

16:35.999 --> 16:37.999
And it was just, like, an
emotional thing, but it was

16:37.999 --> 16:39.999
- super exciting.
- Now, you must be so

16:39.999 --> 16:42.999
proud, but I hear that you got
banned from doing the show?

16:42.999 --> 16:45.999
- Banned?
- From going, from,

16:45.999 --> 16:46.999
- to the show with her?
- No, I didn't get

16:46.999 --> 16:48.999
banned.
I think she just felt the

16:48.999 --> 16:51.999
pressure.
So now it's like I'm jealous of

16:51.999 --> 16:53.999
Kendall and I'm banned from the
VS Show.

16:53.999 --> 16:58.999
And they're all lies, and it's
just not something I want to

16:58.999 --> 17:00.999
- deal with.
- Well, thank you so

17:00.999 --> 17:02.999
much, ladies, and enjoy your
time in Australia.

17:02.999 --> 17:04.999
We absolutely love having you
here, and, um, we'll see you

17:04.999 --> 17:06.999
- soon.
- See you soon.

17:06.999 --> 17:11.999
- Thank you.
- Kylie, answer the

17:11.999 --> 17:13.999
- question.
- I forgot it, 'cause I

17:13.999 --> 17:15.999
- was so mad.
- Kylie is lagging and

17:15.999 --> 17:19.999
being snippy.
I don't even know why.

17:19.999 --> 17:21.999
If it's stuck like this,
then I need to have a C-section.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.999
The delivery is way more scary
to me.

17:24.999 --> 17:26.999
Two weeks.
I can't deliver any later, they

17:26.999 --> 17:28.999
said.

17:39.999 --> 17:41.999
Khloe, I was gonna call
you and talk to you last night

17:41.999 --> 17:43.999
- about this.
- What is it?

17:43.999 --> 17:45.999
Your whole face has
changed.

17:45.999 --> 17:47.999
Did you do any... filler?

17:47.999 --> 17:49.999
Craziest laugh.
No, I asked her that.

17:49.999 --> 17:51.999
- She said no.
- No! I haven't.

17:51.999 --> 17:53.999
You haven't done any
Botox?

17:53.999 --> 17:55.999
- No.
- Khloe, your whole face

17:55.999 --> 17:58.999
changes when you laugh.
It's like, I stare at you.

17:58.999 --> 18:00.999
No, wait.
But, you guys, I think it's

18:00.999 --> 18:02.999
'cause, like, I'm forcing a fake
laugh.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.999
No, you really are
laughing.

18:04.999 --> 18:06.999
No, 'cause you were
so laughing so hard.

18:06.999 --> 18:07.999
- You noticed it?
- Yes!

18:07.999 --> 18:09.999
I thought she was on
drugs. I...

18:09.999 --> 18:11.999
You think I'm on
drugs?!

18:11.999 --> 18:13.999
Oh, my God, you're
gonna die.

18:13.999 --> 18:16.999
Look.

18:16.999 --> 18:19.999
No, like, I'm, like,
freaking out right now.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.999
No, it's, like, her
whole gums and teeth.

18:21.999 --> 18:24.999
I got to go. Bye.

18:24.999 --> 18:26.999
- Oh, my God.
- How was your

18:26.999 --> 18:28.999
- therapy?
- Good.

18:28.999 --> 18:31.999
- Intense?
- Intense. Mm-hmm.

18:31.999 --> 18:33.999
- Wait, what therapy?
- I had to go to

18:33.999 --> 18:35.999
- therapy-- or I didn't have to.
- With Scott?

18:35.999 --> 18:37.999
- Yeah. Yesterday.
- How'd it go?

18:37.999 --> 18:40.999
- Good.
- So, if you are going to

18:40.999 --> 18:43.999
therapy with him, does that mean
you want to work it out?

18:43.999 --> 18:46.999
- No.
- You just want to, like,

18:46.999 --> 18:48.999
- help him.
- I want to have a

18:48.999 --> 18:52.999
relationship with him for my
whole life.

18:52.999 --> 18:56.999
I have committed to going to
therapy with Scott once a week.

18:56.999 --> 18:59.999
You know, we do have three kids
together, and I think it's

18:59.999 --> 19:03.999
really important to be friends,
be there for each other.

19:03.999 --> 19:05.999
What if he was like,
"I'm back, I'm normal. Oh, my

19:05.999 --> 19:07.999
God."?
Would you take him back?

19:07.999 --> 19:09.000
He definitely gets
ahead of himself.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.999
He thinks he's,
like, cured already?

19:11.999 --> 19:13.999
Feel like he's
always like that.

19:13.999 --> 19:16.999
- Feel like there's no rush.
- Scott is getting out of

19:16.999 --> 19:20.999
rehab soon, and of course we
don't have a crystal ball to say

19:20.999 --> 19:22.999
what's gonna happen when he
comes back.

19:22.999 --> 19:25.999
I just hope she's strong.
I hope she sees, like, the

19:25.999 --> 19:28.999
bigger picture and she's not
just gonna jump back into a

19:28.999 --> 19:31.999
- relationship with him.
- I need to work on

19:31.999 --> 19:41.999
things just to co-parent
together.

19:46.999 --> 19:48.999
You guys look so
excited.

19:48.999 --> 19:52.999
I know.
I'm just genuinely hurt, and I

19:52.999 --> 19:56.999
feel a little neglected.
I wish Kendall would just speak

19:56.999 --> 19:59.999
up about this Victoria's Secret
show and-and all the rumors.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.999
She's just really focusing on
herself.

20:01.999 --> 20:03.999
Kylie, answer the
question.

20:03.999 --> 20:05.999
I forgot it 'cause I
was so mad.

20:05.999 --> 20:07.999
Uh, could you describe
Kendall's style for me in a few

20:07.999 --> 20:10.999
- words?
- Um, it's, like, simple

20:10.999 --> 20:13.999
and... sophisticated.

20:15.999 --> 20:17.999
We have tons of
press to do, and of course Kylie

20:17.999 --> 20:21.999
is lagging and being snippy.
I don't even know why she's

20:21.999 --> 20:23.999
acting like this.
She just needs to relax and

20:23.999 --> 20:27.999
enjoy the trip.

20:27.999 --> 20:30.999
Wait, Kylie, look around.
You have to look around.

20:30.999 --> 20:34.999
Look how pretty it is.
Like, the sky is so blue.

20:34.999 --> 20:48.999
Yeah, the sky is so
blue.

20:48.999 --> 20:50.999
Oh, wow, you guys
really redid this place.

20:50.999 --> 20:52.000
This used to be, like, a
barnyard.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.999
- They tore it down.
- This was a chicken

20:53.999 --> 20:55.999
coop that you guys made into,
like, a modern palace.

20:55.999 --> 20:57.999
- It's, like, insane.
- Love this.

20:57.999 --> 20:59.999
- I wish I had this house.
- This is the gorgeous

20:59.999 --> 21:00.999
- counter.
- Amazing.

21:00.999 --> 21:02.999
You should've seen the
paint color they chose.

21:02.999 --> 21:04.999
The whole house was painted
periwinkle, and I was like...

21:04.999 --> 21:06.999
- Periwinkle?
- Pretty much.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.999
Sick. Wow.
People would kill for this.

21:09.999 --> 21:12.999
People would sell their children
to live in a house like this.

21:12.999 --> 21:14.999
This is amazing.
Why wouldn't you want to move in

21:14.999 --> 21:16.999
- here for four months?
- But then to furnish it

21:16.999 --> 21:18.999
- all, and then...
- You have furniture

21:18.999 --> 21:20.999
- from your old house.
- We do, but, like, will

21:20.999 --> 21:22.999
- it all go?
- Yeah, for two

21:22.999 --> 21:24.999
- months.
- No, it's not.

21:24.999 --> 21:26.999
It's till March now.
Then what if it sells?

21:26.999 --> 21:28.999
Then we have to move out right
away.

21:28.999 --> 21:30.999
I mean, don't have
a baby over it.

21:30.999 --> 21:32.999
The house is looking
amazing, but there's still so

21:32.999 --> 21:35.999
much that we'd want to do to it
in order to get the house ready

21:35.999 --> 21:39.999
to be sold, and it just might be
more hassle than it's worth.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.999
I just don't think it's an
option anymore.

21:41.999 --> 21:43.999
So I don't see you
moving in here.

21:43.999 --> 21:46.999
- So what's the plan?
- Ugh, I just don't want

21:46.999 --> 21:48.999
to have to live with my mom.
We've been living with my mom

21:48.999 --> 21:51.999
for, like, it'll be a total of
two years, maybe two years and a

21:51.999 --> 21:53.999
month.
I mean, we're already at my

21:53.999 --> 21:56.999
mom's house, so it's obviously
easier to stay there, but, you

21:56.999 --> 21:59.999
know, my mom's house is really
crazy.

21:59.999 --> 22:02.999
There's so many people in and
out-- just so overwhelming.

22:02.999 --> 22:06.999
It's too much to move in here
and figure it all out and, like,

22:06.999 --> 22:08.999
- make it perfect.
My-my question is,

22:08.999 --> 22:12.999
what if it's not March?
If it's, like, July, Kanye might

22:12.999 --> 22:14.999
- lose an arm.
- He said, "I feel like a

22:14.999 --> 22:17.999
struggle rapper living in my
baby mama's mama's house."

22:17.999 --> 22:27.999
"Mama's mama's."

22:27.999 --> 22:33.999
My face just feels
like a little robot.

22:33.999 --> 22:38.999
So I was reading everything on
Twitter and stuff.

22:38.999 --> 22:41.999
- About what?
- The VS show.

22:41.999 --> 22:44.999
I have been a little
passive-aggressive towards

22:44.999 --> 22:46.999
Kendall.
She doesn't seem to be

22:46.999 --> 22:50.999
understanding why I'm upset, but
we just need to talk.

22:50.999 --> 22:55.999
Everyone thinks that I'm the bad
guy or I'm so jealous.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.999
And everyone was like, "You're
so... you're such a jealous

22:57.999 --> 23:00.999
sister.
Like, how could you not go?"

23:00.999 --> 23:02.999
And I know you don't want
anybody there, but it feels like

23:02.999 --> 23:04.999
- turning on me.
- But, like, it's not

23:04.999 --> 23:07.999
like that at all.
And who cares what people think?

23:07.999 --> 23:10.999
It's just kind of
hurtful, because I wanted to be

23:10.999 --> 23:13.999
- at the show and support you.
- It's a lot to have

23:13.999 --> 23:15.999
every single one of you there
for me.

23:15.999 --> 23:17.999
It's just, like, an extra amount
of pressure and, like...

23:17.999 --> 23:19.999
I'm really sorry if your
feelings were hurt.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.999
It was kind of my night, and I
wanted to take it.

23:22.999 --> 23:25.999
- Totally.
- I told everyone not

23:25.999 --> 23:26.999
to come.
I didn't need all that pressure

23:26.999 --> 23:29.999
there.
Kylie respected what I asked of

23:29.999 --> 23:32.999
her.
But every day, there's some

23:32.999 --> 23:35.999
false story about my family that
someone likes to make up.

23:35.999 --> 23:38.999
They love to spin everything, so
I can understand why it's

23:38.999 --> 23:40.999
frustrating.
Sometimes things get to me, too.

23:40.999 --> 23:44.999
- But you know I love you, boo.
- I love you.

23:44.999 --> 23:46.999
- I love you, bitch.
- I'll never

23:46.999 --> 23:49.999
stop loving you, bitch.

23:56.999 --> 23:59.999
Seriously, my smile is
so  up.

23:59.999 --> 24:02.999
Watch this.
Are you ready?

24:02.999 --> 24:05.999
How crazy?

24:05.999 --> 24:07.000
It's like it only goes
horizontally.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.999
- It's like this.
- Yes.

24:08.999 --> 24:09.999
It doesn't go up
anymore.

24:09.999 --> 24:11.999
It doesn't go up.

24:15.999 --> 24:18.999
Wait, but seriously, like, do
you think, like, sucking dick

24:18.999 --> 24:19.999
could affect that?
I'm not kidding.

24:19.999 --> 24:22.999
I have no idea, but
that's the craziest thing I've

24:22.999 --> 24:28.999
ever heard, 'cause hookers don't
have smiles like that.

24:28.999 --> 24:30.999
I think it's the
stress from Lamar.

24:30.999 --> 24:33.999
I'm not kidding.
So this was the day, my photo

24:33.999 --> 24:35.999
shoot before, and this was
after.

24:35.999 --> 24:37.999
I was very upset to
see him.

24:37.999 --> 24:41.999
Unbelievable that he looked that
good.

24:41.999 --> 24:42.999
- Aw.
- Guv'ny.

24:42.999 --> 24:45.999
- Your hair's long again?
- Kourtney, it's

24:45.999 --> 24:46.999
- extensions.
- Oh, sorry.

24:46.999 --> 24:48.000
You know, you've been in
this game way too long.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.999
Why do you think it's
this fluffy?

24:49.999 --> 24:50.999
It looks good
though.

24:50.999 --> 24:52.999
It doesn't look weird.
It's not, like, "Wow, what's

24:52.999 --> 24:55.999
wrong with you?"
Yeah, so I'm, like, to

24:55.999 --> 24:57.999
the doctors, "How are you gonna
leave this person?"

24:57.999 --> 25:01.999
Like, he's gonna leave there on
the 24th, so I'm going there

25:01.999 --> 25:03.999
tomorrow to meet with, like,
four or five of his doctors in

25:03.999 --> 25:04.999
- the morning.
- He needs to go to a

25:04.999 --> 25:07.999
- home, but where is that home?
- On Monday, the doctors

25:07.999 --> 25:10.000
were like, we'll need, like,
home nursing and blah, blah,

25:10.000 --> 25:12.999
blah.
Um, and they were asking me if I

25:12.999 --> 25:14.999
had an elevator in my house or
this, and I'm like...

25:14.999 --> 25:17.999
I mean, if you're
responsible for him, that's

25:17.999 --> 25:20.999
like, you're locked in for life.
Like, at your house, it's

25:20.999 --> 25:23.999
- different.
- The doctors told me

25:23.999 --> 25:26.999
that Lamar could be going home
as early as two weeks.

25:26.999 --> 25:30.999
We could be discharged from the
hospital and he would be going

25:30.999 --> 25:34.999
home, but Lamar lives in Vegas,
and he needs full-time care.

25:34.999 --> 25:41.999
So... I just don't really know
what to do.

25:41.999 --> 25:44.999
- I feel very overwhelmed.
- Khloe, do not let

25:44.999 --> 25:46.999
them con you into it.

26:03.999 --> 26:04.999
Ah, I just went to the
doctor.

26:04.999 --> 26:06.999
Someone help me take my boots
off.

26:06.999 --> 26:08.999
Mm-hmm.

26:11.999 --> 26:13.999
Whoa, look at that foot.
Kourt, look at my feet.

26:13.999 --> 26:16.999
It's very swollen.
Oh, my gosh.

26:16.999 --> 26:17.999
- I know.
- What does he say

26:17.999 --> 26:19.999
- about that?
- He said he thinks it's

26:19.999 --> 26:22.999
the preeclampsia coming back.
But the baby's breech.

26:22.999 --> 26:26.999
My baby is breech.
The delivery is way more scary

26:26.999 --> 26:30.999
to me because I have to get the
baby turned and in the right

26:30.999 --> 26:32.999
position.
Otherwise, there could be some

26:32.999 --> 26:34.999
complications.
We basically have to get this

26:34.999 --> 26:36.999
baby to term within the next
week.

26:36.999 --> 26:39.999
If it's stuck like this, then I
need to have a C-section.

26:39.999 --> 26:43.999
I have a little bit of high
blood pressure, and I have ur...

26:43.999 --> 26:45.999
protein in my urine, which are
both indications of

26:45.999 --> 26:49.999
preeclampsia, so I have to
deliver before Thanksgiving,

26:49.999 --> 26:52.999
- November 23.
- What?

26:52.999 --> 26:55.999
There's so much
going on in our family.

26:55.999 --> 26:59.999
Khloe is figuring out everything
going on with Lamar.

26:59.999 --> 27:03.999
Scott is going to leave rehab.
And now to find out that the

27:03.999 --> 27:05.999
baby is breech.
It's, like, one thing after the

27:05.999 --> 27:07.999
- other.
- Two weeks.

that are Kendall?

27:51.999 --> 27:53.999
The cool part about
having two people working on a

27:53.999 --> 27:55.999
clothing line is that you kind
of get two opinions on it, and,

27:55.999 --> 27:57.999
for the most part, we have
the... we do have the same

If she, like, really hates

"Ugh, fine, get rid of it."

28:08.999 --> 28:11.999
Well, growing up, is
there a lot of clothes-sharing

28:11.999 --> 28:15.999

Um, I think it's...
it's really amazing, and to have

her do it with me, it's, um,
someone you can always lean on,

28:56.999 --> 28:58.999
it's someone you can always talk
to if you're having, like, some

28:58.999 --> 29:00.999

31:07.999 --> 31:09.999
We'll be right
back.

31:09.999 --> 31:11.999
- Like...
- Yeah, options that are

31:11.999 --> 31:13.999
in Westlake and in Thousand
Oaks.

31:13.999 --> 31:15.999
There has to be a
place closer.

31:15.999 --> 31:18.999
I need to see him, like, almost
every day or every day, and if

31:18.999 --> 31:20.999
- I...
- Yeah, well, there's...

31:20.999 --> 31:22.999
I can't drive to San
Diego.

31:22.999 --> 31:26.999
I had a meeting with all of
Lamar's doctors, and once Lamar

31:26.999 --> 31:30.999
is discharged, he will go to,
like, a transition assisted

31:30.999 --> 31:34.999
living place, because he's great
one day, and then tomorrow he

31:34.999 --> 31:38.999
will completely regress, and
it's my job to find the best

31:38.999 --> 31:40.999
therapy that I can get my hands
on.

31:40.999 --> 31:43.999
I have a meeting
tomorrow with the head of UCLA.

31:43.999 --> 31:45.999
So tomorrow I'll have
answers?

31:45.999 --> 31:47.999
'Cause I'm supposed to tour
places this weekend.

31:47.999 --> 31:49.999
Yes. I'm doing my best,
I promise.

31:49.999 --> 31:51.999
- I love you, beautiful.
- Love you too,

31:51.999 --> 31:56.999
- gorgeous.
- Bye.

32:00.999 --> 32:03.999
- Kourtney is, like, on...
- It's a new

32:03.999 --> 32:05.999
Kourtney.
I've never seen anything like

32:05.999 --> 32:07.999
it.
How is she gonna go back to,

32:07.999 --> 32:11.999
- like, fake married life?
- Is there anything else

32:11.999 --> 32:13.999
that she could, like, do to,
like, get the baby to turn

32:13.999 --> 32:15.999
around?
There's a lot of issues that

32:15.999 --> 32:17.999
she's dealing with.
I wish there was something I

32:17.999 --> 32:25.999
could do to make it better for
her, because I worry.

32:32.999 --> 32:34.999
I have, just, all my
skin tags.

32:34.999 --> 32:36.999
I got 'em burned off before, but
they never came off.

32:36.999 --> 32:38.999
- Okay.
- Ugh, they're because of

32:38.999 --> 32:40.999
- my pregnancy hormones.
- Kim, they're not that

32:40.999 --> 32:42.999
- bad.
- No, I know they're not

32:42.999 --> 32:44.999
- that bad, but I just...
- You want 'em gone.

32:44.999 --> 32:45.999
Do they get stuck on your
necklace? Like...

32:45.999 --> 32:47.999
- No.
- No, 'cause have you

32:47.999 --> 32:49.999
heard that?
I've heard people that, like...

32:49.999 --> 32:51.999
Ew.

32:51.999 --> 32:53.999
- Are you serious?
- If doesn't get rid of

32:53.999 --> 32:55.999
'em, that's what's gonna happen.
They get bigger, and if they get

32:55.999 --> 32:57.999
bigger as she's wearing a
necklace, it's gonna get hooked

32:57.999 --> 32:59.999
- on her necklace.
- That's... that's so

32:59.999 --> 33:02.999
- funny.
- We went out to dinner

33:02.999 --> 33:04.999
- yesterday.
- How was it?

33:04.999 --> 33:06.999
- It was kind of...
- Kourtney is, like, on...

33:06.999 --> 33:07.999
It's a new
Kourtney.

33:07.999 --> 33:09.999
I've never seen anything like
it.

33:09.999 --> 33:11.999
How is she gonna go back to,
like, fake married life?

33:11.999 --> 33:13.999
- She's never gonna...
- She's not, I don't think

33:13.999 --> 33:14.999
- she's gonna.
- Why's she in

33:14.999 --> 33:16.999
- therapy with Scott then?
- 'Cause she's helping

33:16.999 --> 33:17.999
- him.
- I think she's just,

33:17.999 --> 33:19.999
like, help...
It's the father of her children.

33:19.999 --> 33:21.999
She broke it down, and
she said she doesn't even know

33:21.999 --> 33:23.999
what she's gonna do tomorrow,
but today, where she is now, she

33:23.999 --> 33:25.999
wants him to get better for the
kids.

Wait, what's that vagina
thing you were telling me about?

33:38.999 --> 33:39.999
- We got to tell Larsa.
- Takes about 45

33:39.999 --> 33:42.999
minutes, and it'll tighten the
vaginal canal.

33:42.999 --> 33:44.999
Look, maybe you should
do it.

33:44.999 --> 33:45.999
No, I'm not ready for
it now; I'm not spreading eagle

33:45.999 --> 33:47.999
- right now, not mentally.
- Why?

'Cause it's... they're
sticking something in your

33:48.999 --> 33:50.999
vagina-- you have to be prepared
for that.

33:50.999 --> 33:51.999
I never have to be
prepared for that.

33:51.999 --> 33:53.999
Ew, that's a...

34:00.999 --> 34:04.999
So I'm gonna put a
plan together for this breech

34:04.999 --> 34:06.999
birth.
You comfortable?

34:06.999 --> 34:08.999
- Get your head there.
- Yeah.

34:08.999 --> 34:10.999
So let's take this
off.

34:10.999 --> 34:11.999
- Hey, Kris.
- Hey. How are you?

34:11.999 --> 34:14.999
Good. So I assessed
her legs and found out that the

34:14.999 --> 34:17.999
sacrum is causing pressure on
the nervous system.

34:17.999 --> 34:20.999
I hope you don't mind we
turned this room into a

34:20.999 --> 34:22.999
chiropractor's office.

34:22.999 --> 34:24.999
The main thing
that's happening is that her

34:24.999 --> 34:27.999
- spine is very compressed.
- Right, 'cause, yeah.

34:27.999 --> 34:29.999
- I think he's breech right now.
- Right, he's breech

34:29.999 --> 34:32.999
- now.
- Kim is still trying to

34:32.999 --> 34:34.999
figure out where she really
wants to be living.

34:34.999 --> 34:38.999
She's also just found out that
her baby is breech, which puts

34:38.999 --> 34:41.999
more stress on the whole
situation.

34:41.999 --> 34:43.999
It's a very dangerous thing
potentially.

34:43.999 --> 34:47.999
- All right, Kimmy.
- My bed is so high that I

34:47.999 --> 34:50.999
have to do a full sit-up every
time I get up out of bed.

34:50.999 --> 34:52.999
To pee, to move, to switch
positions.

issues that she's dealing with,
and I don't want anything to go

35:05.999 --> 35:09.999
wrong with her pregnancy.

35:30.999 --> 35:33.999
stressed-out Kim's been living
at my house.

35:33.999 --> 35:35.999

A little more.
That's good.

36:02.999 --> 36:07.999
Kris, do you like this amount of
space over here now?

36:07.999 --> 36:10.999
Yeah.
And there's plenty of room over

36:10.999 --> 36:12.999
here.
It's, like, perfect.

36:12.999 --> 36:16.999
I really hate how stressed out
Kim's been living at my house

36:16.999 --> 36:21.999
lately, and as a coincidence,
I was driving around town and

36:21.999 --> 36:26.999
saw a place that magically was
so familiar to me, because Kim's

36:26.999 --> 36:29.999
grandparents used to live there.
And I thought maybe this is a

36:29.999 --> 36:32.999
- sign.
- This is definitely a

36:32.999 --> 36:34.999
different look for you.
I like it.

36:34.999 --> 36:37.999
I do, too.
Buying this piece of property is

36:37.999 --> 36:40.999
probably one of the best things
I've ever done and I feel so

36:40.999 --> 36:43.999
good about it.
This way, I can be out of her

36:43.999 --> 36:46.999
way.
She can have her baby and bring

36:46.999 --> 36:50.999
him home from the hospital and
be peaceful and have space.

36:50.999 --> 36:53.999
And I think it will be really
good for both of us.

I wanted to go a little further

37:52.000 --> 37:55.999
than just L.A., but still I'm
comfortable that I can drive

37:55.999 --> 37:58.999

apartment.

42:02.999 --> 42:06.999
- For who?
- For me, because we felt

42:06.999 --> 42:11.999
so bad that you were so crazy
with all those people at the

42:11.999 --> 42:15.999
house that... we got this.
And we're gonna leave you alone

42:15.999 --> 42:18.999
in my house.
This is my new getaway.

42:18.999 --> 42:21.999
- Are you insane?
- Yeah.

42:21.999 --> 42:26.999
My mom is like so crazy.
I'm literally four centimeters

42:26.999 --> 42:30.999
dilated and the doctor's at the
hospital getting our room ready.

42:30.999 --> 42:32.999
And she's, like, trying to show
me her place.

42:32.999 --> 42:35.999
I realized that it was
getting a little crowded over at

42:35.999 --> 42:37.999
the house and you were...
might not gonna leave for a

42:37.999 --> 42:40.999
- long time.
- I mean, the timing's a

42:40.999 --> 42:43.999
little off, but I'm so grateful
and thankful that she got an

42:43.999 --> 42:47.999
amazing place, so that we won't
be so on top of each other.

42:47.999 --> 42:49.999
- Isn't it good?
- Yeah.

42:49.999 --> 42:51.999
And it's right above
Nana's.

42:51.999 --> 42:53.999
- That is crazy.
- And the view, Kim, the

42:53.999 --> 42:55.999
- street...
- This is really cozy.

42:55.999 --> 43:00.999
- ...is so beautiful.
- My mom is so nice.

43:00.999 --> 43:03.999
She, you know, has been such a
supportive person when she knows

43:03.999 --> 43:07.999
that I'm stressed out.
I am so grateful for her.

43:07.999 --> 43:11.999
- This rug looks so good.
- Oh, wait.

43:11.999 --> 43:13.999
Mom, my  water just
broke.

43:13.999 --> 43:16.999
- What?
- In your new apartment.

43:16.999 --> 43:18.999
- Your water just broke?
- Okay, can I please go to

43:18.999 --> 43:20.999
- the bathroom?
- Yes!

43:20.999 --> 43:23.999
This is epic.
Oh, my God.

43:23.999 --> 43:28.999
This is just spectacular.
Did your water really break?

43:28.999 --> 43:31.000
Seriously, Mom, I'm not
kidding.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.999
This is gonna be an
amazing night.

43:33.999 --> 43:37.999
Let's go.
