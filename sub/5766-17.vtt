WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:04.098
Okay, a couple of things
before we get started.

00:04.130 --> 00:06.269
You are a witness appearing
before a grand jury

00:06.300 --> 00:08.131
in Cook County
and not its target.

00:08.170 --> 00:10.764
But you also have the right
to have an attorney with you

00:10.810 --> 00:12.675
to answer any questions
that you might have.

00:12.710 --> 00:13.802
Do you understand that?

00:13.840 --> 00:14.670
BLAKE:
Yes.

00:17.180 --> 00:18.772
Blake Calamar.

00:18.810 --> 00:23.110
That's C-A-L-A-M-A-R.

00:23.150 --> 00:24.617
Have you and I
ever met before?
Yes,

00:24.650 --> 00:27.710
uh, we have, when
you searched my apartment

00:27.760 --> 00:29.159
and threatened me.

00:29.190 --> 00:30.726
Have we kissed
and made up?

00:30.760 --> 00:32.125
Not really.

00:32.160 --> 00:33.718
Uh, but I intend to tell

00:33.760 --> 00:35.193
the truth here, anyway.

00:35.230 --> 00:36.788
Because you've been
granted immunity.

00:36.830 --> 00:38.661
Well, I'd tell
the truth either way,

00:38.700 --> 00:40.292
but a little immunity
never hurt.

00:40.340 --> 00:41.796
(laughter)
Gary...

00:41.840 --> 00:43.159
where are you
going with this?

00:43.210 --> 00:44.165
I'm showing how
he has knowledge

00:44.210 --> 00:45.165
of criminal activity.

00:45.210 --> 00:46.404
They don't give a rat's ass.

00:46.440 --> 00:47.475
Get on with it.

00:47.510 --> 00:50.479
Where are you employed,
Mr. Calamar?

00:50.510 --> 00:54.412
Until recently, I was employed
at Lockhart/Gardner & Bond.

00:54.450 --> 00:56.816
And you were brought there
by Mr. Derrick Bond,

00:56.850 --> 00:58.147
is that correct?
Yes.

00:58.190 --> 00:59.657
CARY:
And he was recently forced out.

00:59.690 --> 01:02.420
BLAKE:
By the other partners,
uh, Diane Lockhart

01:02.460 --> 01:03.552
and Will Gardner.

01:03.590 --> 01:05.182
CARY:
And you were also

01:05.230 --> 01:07.494
in the employ of someone else
while working in Chicago.

01:07.530 --> 01:08.656
Yes. I did supply,

01:08.700 --> 01:10.167
and still supply,

01:10.200 --> 01:11.827
support for Lemond Bishop.

01:11.870 --> 01:13.861
CARY: And what is
Mr. Bishop's business?

01:13.900 --> 01:15.333
Well, he has several.

01:15.370 --> 01:18.203
Uh... a string of dry cleaners,

01:18.240 --> 01:19.776
uh, health clubs...

01:19.810 --> 01:22.142
Isn't he also the top
dealer of illegal drugs

01:22.180 --> 01:24.205
in Cook County?
I don't... know much

01:24.250 --> 01:25.342
about that.
And didn't you
also work

01:25.380 --> 01:27.848
for a time protecting his
interests in prostitution?

01:27.880 --> 01:30.610
I was a part
of his security detail.

01:30.650 --> 01:32.686
I just went where
he told me.

01:32.720 --> 01:35.211
And you brought his business
to Lockhart/Gardner.

01:35.260 --> 01:38.127
Yes. Yes, his... legal business.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.127
Let's tu rn

01:39.160 --> 01:40.855
to the target of
this grand jury.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.219
How do you know her?

01:42.270 --> 01:44.124
Kalinda Sharma?
Yes.

01:44.170 --> 01:46.695
She's an investigator
at Lockhart/Gardner.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.402
This is where you were witness
to her illegal activities.

01:50.940 --> 01:53.135
Yes.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.282
It's a new day.

02:04.220 --> 02:06.279
You sound sarcastic.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.653
No. _That was me
beIng genume.

02:09.690 --> 02:11.783
Bond is gone;
Blake is gone--

02:11.830 --> 02:13.798
so what's wrong?

02:13.830 --> 02:16.822
What makes you think
anything is wrong?

02:19.670 --> 02:22.400
Ever get the
feeling something
bad is gonna happen?

02:22.440 --> 02:23.930
(laughs)

02:23.970 --> 02:25.938
All the time.

02:25.970 --> 02:28.370
It's a vulnerable time--
we need to make it look

02:28.410 --> 02:30.844
like the loss of Bond
makes us stronger, not weaker.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.313
We _cannot_ lose
a Single client.

02:32.350 --> 02:33.510
It'll become
a domino effect.

02:33.550 --> 02:35.415
So meet with all
your accounts...

02:35.450 --> 02:36.587
If there's a hint
of unhappiness,

02:36.620 --> 02:37.712
tell us,
and we'll fill the room.

02:37.750 --> 02:38.785
All right, let's do it.

02:38.820 --> 02:40.219
ALICIA:
It's about a law firm

02:40.260 --> 02:43.252
with a sphere of influence.

02:43.290 --> 02:45.258
Chicago and DC,

02:45.290 --> 02:47.190
DC and Chicago.

02:47.230 --> 02:48.197
No.

02:48.230 --> 02:50.960
You know what it's about?

02:51.000 --> 02:53.764
Being in the larger
conference room.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.495
Your business isn't
confined to one City,

02:55.540 --> 02:57.269
and neither should
your law firm be.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.232
ALICIA: What we see
for you is, uh...

02:59.280 --> 03:00.702
Mr. Bishop
thank you for coming on in,

03:00.740 --> 03:02.241
hearing from us.

03:02.280 --> 03:03.042
No problem.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.207
Derrick wanted me
to go with him.

03:05.250 --> 03:06.342
I know.

03:06.380 --> 03:07.677
I'll be honest.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.847
We had a disagreement
about the direction

03:09.890 --> 03:12.450
of the firm,
and we... we want

03:12.490 --> 03:14.879
to do everything we can
to make you happy.

03:14.920 --> 03:15.989
Are we
happy, Dex?

03:16.020 --> 03:17.681
We're getting
there.

03:17.730 --> 03:20.324
Well, good, because
we're here for you.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.349
That's good to know.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.368
Because...

03:23.400 --> 03:26.369
I do have something... (sighs)

03:26.400 --> 03:27.469
unusuaL"

03:28.570 --> 03:30.265
...I have to
ask of you.

03:30.310 --> 03:31.299
And her.

03:32.940 --> 03:35.329
Polling.
Look, Diane,

03:35.380 --> 03:36.972
I'm in no danger
of leaving you guys.

03:37.010 --> 03:39.001
I never liked Bond,
so don't...

03:39.050 --> 03:41.348
Holy...!
Look at_
the comparison.

03:41.380 --> 03:42.984
Uh, D-Diane, I gotta go.

03:43.020 --> 03:45.284
No, no, no, no.
We-we just closed

03:45.320 --> 03:46.981
within a point
of Wendy Scott-Carr.

03:47.020 --> 03:47.952
Bye.

03:47.990 --> 03:50.322
We're gonna win this.
Don't say it, damn it.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.384
Go outside and
come back In.

03:51.430 --> 03:52.328
Nora!

03:52.360 --> 03:53.657
Get the DCC on the phone.

03:53.700 --> 03:54.724
They're here.

03:54.760 --> 03:55.897
They're here?
Who's here?

03:55.930 --> 03:57.898
NORA:
Frank Landau.

03:57.930 --> 03:59.739
Head of the
Democratic Committee?

03:59.770 --> 04:01.829
And the mountain
comes to Muhammad.

04:01.870 --> 04:03.269
Well, this should be fun.

04:03.310 --> 04:04.732
Eli Gold.

04:04.770 --> 04:06.306
Frank Landau.

04:06.340 --> 04:07.477
You've met
Matt Becker.

04:07.510 --> 04:09.842
So, you did it--
you got rid of Childs.

04:09.880 --> 04:13.270
Well, Childs dropped
out for family reasons.
We'll support you.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.276
We'll climb on board;
but we need a couple

04:15.320 --> 04:16.742
of guarantees first,
from you and Peter.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.917
We have a couple of people
on Childs' staff,

04:18.950 --> 04:20.588
we need to make sure they stay.

04:20.620 --> 04:21.848
Wh-What are you doing?

04:21.890 --> 04:24.256
Nothing. Go on.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.793
You're not outsiders
anymore, so--

04:26.830 --> 04:29.663
(unzipping)
Eli, what are you doing?

04:29.700 --> 04:31.065
I'm lowering my pants.

04:31.100 --> 04:34.831
Why?
To make it easier for you
to kiss my ass.

04:34.870 --> 04:38.931
You think I'll get
a warmer welcome from Wendy?

04:38.970 --> 04:40.403
(chuckles)
I'm sure you will,

04:40.440 --> 04:41.930
up until the day
they get elected.

04:41.980 --> 04:43.641
What do you want?

04:43.680 --> 04:47.446
I'll think about it
and give you a call.

04:47.480 --> 04:50.608
Just to warn you,
Mr. Bishop,

04:50.650 --> 04:53.084
we _need to be a bit_ cautious
In the way we discuss

04:53.120 --> 04:56.521
your more street-
level holdings.

04:58.560 --> 05:01.028
My wife is divorcing me.

05:04.630 --> 05:06.439
I'm so sorry.

05:06.470 --> 05:08.859
BISHOP:
Thank you.

05:08.900 --> 05:11.869
She had a divorce
lawyer call.

05:11.910 --> 05:14.071
I'm embarrassed
to say...

05:14.110 --> 05:17.079
I was surprised.

05:17.110 --> 05:19.613
I love my wife.

05:21.450 --> 05:23.088
I love my kids.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.111
But my business
sometimes takes me

05:25.150 --> 05:26.959
away from home.

05:26.990 --> 05:29.117
(quietly):
Of course.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.720
I hope we find some
way to work this out.

05:31.760 --> 05:32.954
It's better
to be careful.

05:33.000 --> 05:33.955
(sighing):
Yes.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.399
And given the...
(sighs)

05:35.430 --> 05:38.729
difficulties
of my...

05:38.770 --> 05:40.795
business...

05:40.840 --> 05:43.001
a divorce may
prove problematic.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.099
WILL: Well, we are a
full-service firm, sir.

05:45.140 --> 05:46.778
We're in your corner.

05:46.810 --> 05:48.334
Thank you.

05:53.450 --> 05:54.678
WILL:
Well,

05:54.720 --> 05:56.938
even drug dealers
get divorced, too.

05:56.990 --> 06:00.118
Alicia, you work with
David Lee on this.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.014
Got it._
So, politics

06:02.060 --> 06:04.483
the politics, but
the business of this office

06:04.530 --> 06:05.758
still continues.

06:05.790 --> 06:08.395
And don't worry,
all-all salary

06:08.430 --> 06:10.466
and job commitments
will be honored.
For the lucky few.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.867
You care to share that,
Geneva, with everybody?

06:13.900 --> 06:17.404
Sure. The new state's attorney
cleans house-- you know that.

06:17.440 --> 06:20.034
No. I mean, whoever
wins, the budget
crisis is so extreme,

06:20.080 --> 06:22.446
they can't start over.

06:22.480 --> 06:25.779
And everybody in this
room has a commitment from
this office, either way.

06:25.810 --> 06:27.471
You're a survivor,
aren't you, Geneva?

06:27.520 --> 06:29.784
Are you telling me that
none of those sick days

06:29.820 --> 06:31.048
from last month _were
spent interVIewmg?

06:31.090 --> 06:33.149
(laughter)

06:33.190 --> 06:35.385
Go back to
work, people.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.899
You're wrong
about one thing.

06:39.930 --> 06:41.898
Not everybody in this room
has a commitment.

06:41.930 --> 06:44.091
Well, your salary bump
is in the works.

06:44.130 --> 06:46.735
It's moving slowly.
Well, let's get
it moving fast.

06:46.770 --> 06:48.931
I want friends in
this office, Cary.

06:48.970 --> 06:50.733
I'm not gonna
screw you over.

06:50.770 --> 06:52.977
Just don't screw me over.

06:53.010 --> 06:54.568
ALICIA:
His businesses

06:54.610 --> 06:56.908
aren't doing well.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.099
Huh?

06:59.250 --> 07:02.549
Bishop-- his business--
it's been hurt by the economy.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.581
Yeah, his
legal business.

07:05.620 --> 07:07.508
Oh, it's all right.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.913
I'm trying to drink less.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.188
Since when?

07:10.230 --> 07:12.892
My daughter-- she thinks
I drink too much.

07:12.930 --> 07:14.989
You know what
your problem is?

07:15.030 --> 07:16.895
I don't drink enough?

07:16.930 --> 07:18.659
You didn't get
your tubes tied.

07:18.700 --> 07:19.792
(laughing)

07:22.810 --> 07:24.061
(amused):
Oh...

07:24.110 --> 07:25.509
Here.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.043
I saw you get this
upstairs-- what is it?

07:31.080 --> 07:32.479
Go ahead.

07:35.820 --> 07:37.481
Oh, my God.

07:37.520 --> 07:41.183
Yep. It's my grand
jury subpoena.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.720
Kalinda, why are
you being so calm?

07:46.760 --> 07:47.988
I'm not.

07:48.030 --> 07:50.021
It's just it's been
a long time coming.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.162
What has?

07:51.200 --> 07:55.569
State's attorney thinks
too many people leak to me.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.068
But... Kalinda,
this is for Wednesday.

07:58.110 --> 08:00.578
You need to call
a lawyer.
Yeah, I did.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.840
VVho?
You.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.053
* Sold me a bill of goods...

08:20.100 --> 08:22.091
Hey. Jimmy Patrick
back with you.

08:22.130 --> 08:24.269
Jesus was black.
(bell dings)

08:24.300 --> 08:26.791
There goes another Sunday school
lesson down the drain.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.068
(toilet flushing)

08:28.100 --> 08:31.536
All those preachers saying Jesus
was as white as Billy Graham--

08:31.570 --> 08:32.798
(whispers):
Nope. Sorry.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.979
You see this skin?
He was darker than me.

08:35.010 --> 08:36.034
Middle-Eastern. Mm-hmm.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.809
That's right, the Son of God

08:37.850 --> 08:41.013
looked like Chris Rock,
not Lance Armstrong.

08:41.050 --> 08:43.644
What this office needs is a
breath of fresh air, and that's

08:43.690 --> 08:46.989
why I support Wendy Scott-Carr
for state's attorney.

08:47.020 --> 08:48.055
ANNOUNCER:
You're watching
the live coverage...

08:48.090 --> 08:50.058
You need to change your
campaign strategy, Eli.

08:50.090 --> 08:50.886
You know it.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.989
We were never gonna
get him anyway.

08:53.030 --> 08:54.224
Doesn't matter.
Look at the polling.

08:54.260 --> 08:55.295
You're not counting
the youth vote.

08:55.330 --> 08:56.866
I am counting
the youth votes.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.925
Wendy's got the black vote
and the liberal whites.

08:58.970 --> 09:00.892
You need blue-
collar whites.
Oh, you mean

09:00.940 --> 09:01.998
the racist whites?

09:02.040 --> 09:03.564
Your politics is getting
in the way of your polling.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.066
You need_
blue-collar whites,

09:05.110 --> 09:07.101
soccer moms, you need to start
pushing a new message:

09:07.140 --> 09:10.041
"Bring back the old Chicago."
Why not

09:10.080 --> 09:11.809
"Save our neighborhoods"?
Sure.

09:11.850 --> 09:14.819
Although I know you think
that's... too obvious and unhip.

09:14.850 --> 09:16.044
And racist.
They're votes.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.048
You don't cater to them,
they sit this one out,

09:18.090 --> 09:19.648
and you lose
by one point.

09:19.690 --> 09:21.180
Read the projections.

09:21.220 --> 09:23.825
Go ahead. You need to take the
black faces off the Web site.

09:23.860 --> 09:25.828
Put Peter on the dais
with white suburbanites,

09:25.860 --> 09:29.159
and stop doing photo
ops south of 47th.

09:29.200 --> 09:34.137
So, what are you
going to do, Eli?

09:34.170 --> 09:36.229
BISHOP:
Look at me.

09:36.270 --> 09:38.238
I made a mistake.

09:38.270 --> 09:40.306
I said I'm sorry.

09:40.340 --> 09:43.605
That doesn't change anything.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.675
You slept with her.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.871
She didn't mean anything.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.013
I'm in love with you.

09:50.050 --> 09:52.143
You don't cheat on the person
you're in love with.

09:52.190 --> 09:54.681
I said it won't
happen again.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.153
It will happen again.

09:56.190 --> 09:59.079
Because the easiest thing in
the world is for you to say

09:59.130 --> 10:01.792
it won't happen again.
I'll go to counseling.

10:01.830 --> 10:04.697
Let's just ask these
lawyers to leave.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.163
No. Let's start.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.395
DAVID: _ _
We suggest mediation--

10:08.440 --> 10:10.101
one veto apiece
for mediators.

10:10.140 --> 10:11.767
At alternating sites?

10:11.810 --> 10:13.698
You mean, your
mother's living room?

10:13.740 --> 10:17.107
We rent space from
a law firm in the Loop.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.402
How nice for you.
Can I have one of your cards?

10:19.450 --> 10:20.712
I imagine

10:20.750 --> 10:23.639
you're too new to be
in the phone book.

10:23.690 --> 10:26.659
Thank you.

10:30.990 --> 10:32.127
What do you want, Mr. Bishop?

10:32.160 --> 10:34.219
I want her
not to leave me.

10:34.260 --> 10:37.991
The best way to put out a fire
is to starve it of oxygen.

10:38.030 --> 10:41.136
In a divorce, owgen is money.

10:41.170 --> 10:43.866
If she doesn't
get your money,
she won't leave.

10:43.910 --> 10:47.038
Whatever you need to do.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.842
I guess it's sweet:
a drug kingpin in love.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.143
She really had a hard time
finding a lawyer.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.839
This guy's barely
out of law school.

10:58.890 --> 11:01.450
It's not the safest
thing for him to do,

11:01.490 --> 11:03.219
helping her
divorce Bishop.

11:03.260 --> 11:05.182
Where's Kalinda? I thought she
was checking into his finances.

11:05.230 --> 11:07.198
His dry cleaners,
health clubs, gas stations--

11:07.230 --> 11:10.063
they're all on the verge
of Chapter 11.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.068
He's propping them up
with his other income.

11:12.100 --> 11:14.739
Good. Let her try
to go after his drug trade.

11:14.770 --> 11:18.331
That's a battle
I am prepared to win.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.099
No matter what,
you plead the Fifth.

11:25.180 --> 11:27.239
Kalinda, the only way
that this works

11:27.280 --> 11:29.748
and the only reason
I agreed to be your lavwer

11:29.790 --> 11:31.189
was you do as I say.

11:31.220 --> 11:34.109
They get you talking,
they win.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.481
You defend yourself,
they win.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.727
Okay.

11:41.130 --> 11:43.223
The questions are devised
to make you look bad,

11:43.270 --> 11:45.226
so no matter, you say...?

11:45.270 --> 11:46.965
I refuse to answer

11:47.000 --> 11:48.797
on the grounds
it may incriminate me.

11:48.840 --> 11:49.966
Good.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.433
Now, a Chicago grand jury
will indict a ham sandwich.

11:52.470 --> 11:56.372
Don't say a thing;
don't make their job easier.

12:03.550 --> 12:05.745
Kalinda... what's going on?

12:05.790 --> 12:08.258
I can't help you
unless I know.

12:09.290 --> 12:11.326
It's about Blake.

12:11.360 --> 12:14.523
Dr. Booth from last year.

12:14.560 --> 12:18.326
The psychologist
from our pharmaceutical win?

12:18.370 --> 12:19.519
Yeah.

12:19.570 --> 12:21.834
Blake broke into his
office and beat him up.

12:21.870 --> 12:23.428
That's how we won.

12:23.470 --> 12:24.664
(sighs)

12:24.710 --> 12:28.009
He tried to set me up by leaving
my fingerprints on a glass.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.371
Why is Blake doing this?

12:29.410 --> 12:30.547
(sighs)

12:30.580 --> 12:32.309
He's not a very good person.

12:36.150 --> 12:39.916
I don't want to pry,
but you have to trust me.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.258
I do trust you.

12:42.290 --> 12:43.359
More than usual.

12:47.960 --> 12:50.121
Um, I'm not, um...

12:52.430 --> 12:55.490
It's not in my nature
to talk, Alicia.

12:55.540 --> 12:58.065
I'm not hiding anything.

13:02.040 --> 13:05.407
Can you keep me out of jail?

13:08.520 --> 13:09.942
GRACE:
I'm home!

13:11.420 --> 13:13.479
Oh, Pastor Isaiah.

13:13.520 --> 13:14.919
Are you waiting for my dad?

13:14.960 --> 13:16.848
Yes.

13:16.890 --> 13:18.858
I'm Grace.

13:18.890 --> 13:21.097
I know. Hello.

13:24.170 --> 13:26.126
Do you think
Jesus was black?

13:26.170 --> 13:28.934
Do I?

13:28.970 --> 13:30.938
Yeah.

13:30.970 --> 13:33.939
He was dark-skinned, being
a Middle-Eastern Jew.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.437
Doesn't it make you mad
when people make him white?

13:36.480 --> 13:38.300
I think people always want

13:38.350 --> 13:40.215
to see Jesus
as looking like them.

13:40.250 --> 13:42.047
But isn't that bad?

13:42.080 --> 13:43.479
Sometimes.

13:43.520 --> 13:44.282
Sometimes not.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.379
Do you believe
in global warming?

13:46.420 --> 13:49.878
Yes. I do.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.079
Do you?

13:51.130 --> 13:53.348
Yeah, and what about politics?

13:53.400 --> 13:55.220
Are you a Democrat?

13:55.260 --> 13:57.899
I try not
to answer that question.

13:57.930 --> 13:59.067
Yeah, but you're an
African-American,

13:59.100 --> 14:00.965
so it makes sense
to be a Democrat.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.436
I think a lot of things that
make sense aren't always true.

14:04.470 --> 14:06.199
ELI:
I am ending this call.

14:06.240 --> 14:07.332
Pastor Isaiah,
I'm so sorry.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.304
Peter asked me to tell you
that he can't make it today.

14:12.950 --> 14:13.644
Hi.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.375
We were just talking.

14:15.420 --> 14:17.240
How nice.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.439
Do you think
Jesus was black?

14:20.420 --> 14:22.081
We thought

14:22.120 --> 14:23.929
he's black, or dark-skinned.

14:23.960 --> 14:26.451
He was a Middle-Eastern Jew,
so it makes sense.

14:28.460 --> 14:30.928
Sure. He must have been
something, right?

14:30.970 --> 14:32.426
(genﬂelaugh)

14:32.470 --> 14:33.994
Could you, um,

14:34.040 --> 14:36.133
excuse us for a moment,
please, Grace?

14:36.170 --> 14:38.161
I like talking to you.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.632
I like talking to you.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.535
Peter asked me to say that,

14:41.580 --> 14:43.946
for the last few weeks
of the campaign,

14:43.980 --> 14:46.540
I'll need him full-time,
so could he have a rain check on

14:46.580 --> 14:49.617
your spiritual
guidance days?

14:49.650 --> 14:51.515
Is that what Peter wants?

14:51.550 --> 14:54.610
It's just for the last
few weeks of the campaign.

14:54.660 --> 14:56.457
Oh, and the
prayer breakfast.

14:56.490 --> 14:58.424
My mistake. We have
a scheduling conflict.

14:58.460 --> 15:01.349
Peter's making a speech
at his son's school.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.492
You understand.

15:02.530 --> 15:04.521
I think I do.

15:06.530 --> 15:08.293
It's just until
the election.

15:08.340 --> 15:12.663
After that, the schedule
starts to loosen up.

15:12.710 --> 15:15.338
I'm sure it will.

15:15.380 --> 15:16.438
Good-bye, Pastor!

15:16.480 --> 15:18.471
Good-bye, Grace.

15:22.280 --> 15:25.078
MEDIATOR: Welcome to
mediation, everybody.

15:25.120 --> 15:27.008
I'm your mutually
agreed upon mediator.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.415
My name is Frederick Medkiff.
Please call me Fred.

15:29.460 --> 15:33.396
And I want to assure both sides
that I'm here to help you reach

15:33.430 --> 15:34.556
a yes.
KATRINA:
You're kidding me.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.693
MARS: This is crazy.
You expect us to believe

15:36.730 --> 15:38.391
Mr. Bishop is
almost broke?
You can believe

15:38.430 --> 15:39.567
what you want,
but he is actually almost broke.

15:39.600 --> 15:43.707
Before we move to specifics,
let's share a few thoughts

15:43.740 --> 15:45.401
on what we want to get.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.169
KATRINA:
I helped you build up

15:47.210 --> 15:48.404
that business, Lemond.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.544
I put my life on hold
so you could build it.

15:50.580 --> 15:52.468
And what business
would that be, ma'am?
MAN:
Oh, come on.

15:52.510 --> 15:54.546
If she goes to jail for it,
he goes to jail, too.

15:54.580 --> 15:55.717
DAVID: Uh, I'm sorry.
Was that a threat?

15:55.750 --> 15:57.081
No. You want a threat?
Here's a threat.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.384
LEMOND:
Wait, wait, wait. Did he just
say what I think he just said?

15:59.420 --> 16:01.012
You can go to hell,
and this whole stupid...

16:01.060 --> 16:02.413
And is he really threatening me
with jail time?

16:02.460 --> 16:04.553
I see no need for any
harsh language here at all.

16:04.590 --> 16:06.251
Now, it's not wrong
to express feelings,

16:06.290 --> 16:07.154
but let's all take a breath.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.497
You owe me half.

16:08.530 --> 16:09.519
DAVID:
Half of what?
Half of Chapter 11?

16:09.560 --> 16:11.164
We'd like to call a witness.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.326
It's our right.

16:12.370 --> 16:14.691
I work
for the anti-gang division

16:14.740 --> 16:16.059
of the Illinois office of

16:16.100 --> 16:17.431
the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

16:17.470 --> 16:19.131
Come on.
Now you're kidding.

16:19.170 --> 16:20.535
MARS: And you've been
following Mr. Bishop's

16:20.580 --> 16:23.003
activities for how long now?

16:23.050 --> 16:24.199
Five years.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.569
Mr. Bishop.

16:25.610 --> 16:28.272
Agent Hemings.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.208
Can you give us
a recent valuation

16:30.250 --> 16:32.013
of Mr. Bishop's
illegal drug activity?

16:32.050 --> 16:34.587
Acknowledging that it's merely
the deepest conjecture

16:34.620 --> 16:37.282
from a man who would arrest
my client if he had any proof.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.286
We have no subpoena power
here, Mr. Lee.

16:39.330 --> 16:40.695
No court reporter,
no transcripts.

16:40.730 --> 16:43.460
This is purely a mediation.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.525
This input will help me
determine a fair settlement.

16:45.570 --> 16:47.595
Our last estimate,
we put the valuation

16:47.640 --> 16:50.029
of Mr. Bishop's drug trade
at $88 million.

16:50.070 --> 16:51.606
DAVID:
Oh, come on.

16:51.640 --> 16:53.437
Now you're dreaming.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.300
The FBI doesn't dream,
Mr. Lee.
Oh, really?

16:55.340 --> 16:57.479
What were you doing
on September 11?

16:57.510 --> 16:58.442
That was not us.
That was the CIA.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.539
Oh, it was the CIA,
was it?

17:00.580 --> 17:01.717
Yeah, the CIA.
Ignored incredible intel.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.149
You know, it's in
the history books.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.316
Have you read
the 911 report?

17:04.350 --> 17:06.079
ALICIA:
And you've kept the books

17:06.120 --> 17:07.348
for how long, Mr. Roja?

17:07.390 --> 17:09.483
Uh, about three years.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.624
Uh-- but I wouldn't call them
exactly books, you know.

17:11.660 --> 17:13.491
I-I keep count.

17:13.530 --> 17:15.794
And is $88 million a
correct valuation?

17:15.830 --> 17:18.321
(laughs)
Whoo!

17:18.370 --> 17:20.167
I wish!
I mean, that...

17:20.200 --> 17:22.464
that may be what the FBI sees
coming in, but there's breakage.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.401
You know, how much product and
cash just walks out of the door.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.305
We have payments
that we have to make

17:27.340 --> 17:29.069
regularly.

17:29.110 --> 17:30.509
MEDKIFF:
Um...

17:30.550 --> 17:32.245
Never mind.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.816
ALICIA:
And the economy?

17:33.850 --> 17:36.569
Yeah, you would think this
economy would be good for us,

17:36.620 --> 17:39.646
but a lot of our high-end
customers are pulling back

17:39.690 --> 17:41.089
or finding
different avenues.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.712
I mean, there's still
some street level,

17:42.760 --> 17:44.580
but then there's the
trickle-down effect.

17:44.630 --> 17:45.824
ALICIA:
What do you estimate then?

17:45.860 --> 17:47.452
Uh, I don't know.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.821
Uh... three million
a year gross.

17:49.860 --> 17:53.432
(scoffs)
Oh, come on.
You calling me a liar?

17:53.470 --> 17:55.597
Dexter, you don't
really believe...
You know,
Kat, seriously...

17:55.640 --> 17:57.267
Please!
KATRINA:
Shut up!

17:57.310 --> 17:59.460
DAVID: No. I'm gonna
call you on your bluff.

17:59.510 --> 18:01.831
MARS: Mrs. Bishop is not walking
away with one million dollars.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.575
Well, then, let's
go to court.

18:03.610 --> 18:05.100
They both end up
in prison.

18:05.150 --> 18:06.139
Your client doesn't want that.

18:06.180 --> 18:08.444
My client doesn't want
Mrs. Bishop to have a cent.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.539
He's in love, and people
in love do desperate things.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.114
MARS:
Oh, is that a threat?

18:12.150 --> 18:13.287
It's a fact.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.582
You don't realize.

18:14.620 --> 18:16.485
Mrs. Bishop has the kids,
and she doesn't have

18:16.520 --> 18:18.579
to go to court
to keep him from the kids.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.427
That's what I call a threat.

18:20.460 --> 18:23.520
Yeah. Tell Mr. Bishop
to come up with a number.

18:25.530 --> 18:27.669
A million bucks
on the table,

18:27.700 --> 18:29.634
and she threatens him
with the kids.

18:29.670 --> 18:31.558
Find out why she's
going scorched earth.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.668
Okay.

18:35.640 --> 18:36.800
What was that about?

18:36.840 --> 18:39.149
Another case.

18:39.950 --> 18:42.248
Are you comfortable?

18:43.720 --> 18:45.642
Iam.

18:45.690 --> 18:50.389
I see you have availed yourself
of an attorney, Miss Sharma.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.625
I would warn her,
per Illinois statute,

18:52.660 --> 18:53.627
you may consult with her,

18:53.660 --> 18:55.298
but she may not speak
at these proceedings.

18:55.330 --> 18:56.524
Is that
understood?
It IS.

18:56.560 --> 18:59.495
How long have you worked
at Lockhhart/Gardner?

19:01.500 --> 19:03.707
I refuse to answer
on the grounds

19:03.740 --> 19:05.628
that it may
incriminate me.

19:09.340 --> 19:11.649
I see. That's how
we're gonna handle this?
As is Miss Sharma's right.

19:11.680 --> 19:14.217
We ask that the state's attorney
accept a blanket statement

19:14.250 --> 19:15.547
of Fifth Amendment protection.

19:15.580 --> 19:17.309
Let me ask that
Mrs. Florrick remain silent.

19:19.420 --> 19:22.218
Did you beat
the psychologist-- Dr. Booth?

19:22.260 --> 19:23.750
I refuse to answer
on the grounds

19:23.790 --> 19:24.825
that it may
incriminate me.

19:24.860 --> 19:27.897
Were you ordered by
your superior, Mr. Will Gardner,

19:27.930 --> 19:30.728
to beat Dr. Booth?

19:30.770 --> 19:31.919
KALINDA:
I refuse to answer

19:31.970 --> 19:34.393
on the grounds
that it may incriminate me.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.965
Were you ordered by your
superior, Diane Lockhart,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.332
to beat Dr. Booth?

19:39.370 --> 19:40.769
KALINDA:
I refuse to answer

19:40.810 --> 19:42.732
on the grounds
that it may incriminate me.

19:42.780 --> 19:43.804
CARY:
But it makes sense

19:43.850 --> 19:45.772
that you would only act
at the behest

19:45.810 --> 19:46.970
of your superiors.

19:47.010 --> 19:48.716
I refuse to answer
on the grounds

19:48.750 --> 19:49.614
that it may incriminate me.

19:49.650 --> 19:51.208
GLENN: Would you care
to share that note

19:51.250 --> 19:53.753
with the rest of us,
Miss Sharma?

19:53.790 --> 19:54.779
It's attorney-client
work product,

19:54.820 --> 19:56.617
so we politely decline.

19:56.660 --> 19:58.252
CARY:
Is there a systematic plan

19:58.290 --> 20:00.656
at Lockhart/Gardner to break
the law when pursuing cases?

20:00.700 --> 20:02.952
I refuse to answer
on the grounds

20:03.000 --> 20:06.527
that it may
incriminate me.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.433
He can't be coming after us.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.539
Childs is a lame duck.

20:15.580 --> 20:17.343
That's exactly when
he would be coming after us.

20:17.380 --> 20:18.904
He doesn't have to deal
with the political heat.

20:18.950 --> 20:21.510
Oh, could still
be about me.

20:21.550 --> 20:22.972
Overcharging at the grand jury.

20:23.020 --> 20:26.717
No. Childs is communicating
through us to you two.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.786
That's the only reason
he hauled Kalinda in--

20:28.820 --> 20:29.980
so_ we'd hear
their questions.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.386
So, what's the
next step?

20:32.430 --> 20:35.354
Grand jury is questioning
their star witness again.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.389
Blake.

20:36.430 --> 20:37.897
Blake.

20:37.930 --> 20:39.864
What is this?

20:43.710 --> 20:45.359
Maybe you should talk to him.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.002
Blake.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.576
Maybe you should.

21:12.670 --> 21:15.833
(mouse clicking)

21:24.410 --> 21:26.742
(mouse clicking)

21:36.360 --> 21:37.588
Tell me about your dad.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.325
Anything that comes to mind.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.590
My dad's my best friend.
Oh.

21:41.630 --> 21:43.097
He takes me to school.

21:43.130 --> 21:44.461
We play baseball.
Oh.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.627
And he showed me how
to make sloppy Joes.

21:46.670 --> 21:48.467
The secret's brown sugar.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.832
MEDKIFF: Brown sugar.
Sounds delicious.

21:50.870 --> 21:52.906
So, dads can be fun, huh?

21:55.140 --> 21:57.904
You feel like
you can count on your dad?

21:57.950 --> 21:59.747
Uh-huh.

21:59.780 --> 22:01.748
One time, I ate a peanut.

22:05.590 --> 22:06.739
My dad slept
in my room.

22:06.790 --> 22:08.610
MEDKIFF: What happened the
last time you had a birthday--

22:08.660 --> 22:10.480
what'd you do?

22:10.530 --> 22:12.953
For my birthday, Mom and Dad,
they got a ice cream truck,

22:12.990 --> 22:15.857
and I could have
as much as I wanted.

22:15.900 --> 22:18.368
Dylan, what is
your dad's job?

22:20.740 --> 22:22.662
He's a businessman.
Mm-hmm.

22:22.700 --> 22:24.133
Have you ever seen
your dad on TV?

22:24.170 --> 22:25.865
I don't think
that's relevant.
It is if you're making

22:25.910 --> 22:27.059
a custody determination.

22:27.110 --> 22:30.602
Dylan, what did you see on TV?

22:33.080 --> 22:34.809
I saw this man.

22:34.850 --> 22:38.513
He said
my dad did bad things.
Hm.

22:38.550 --> 22:40.859
But my dad, he said
it was a mistake.

22:40.890 --> 22:42.084
He said not to watch.

22:42.120 --> 22:43.758
What else did the man
say about your dad?

22:43.790 --> 22:44.882
Enough.

22:45.790 --> 22:47.826
Enough.

22:47.860 --> 22:50.420
Mr. Bishop, your lavwers
will have their chance.

22:50.470 --> 22:51.459
No.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.559
Dylan...

22:53.600 --> 22:55.989
you don't have to answer
any more questions.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.928
Was I bad?
No.

22:57.970 --> 22:59.699
No, you could never be bad.

22:59.740 --> 23:03.540
I'll talk to Mommy.

23:03.580 --> 23:06.674
$21 million and
joint custody.

23:06.710 --> 23:08.541
(laughing)

23:08.580 --> 23:11.447
You don't want me
to take that back to him.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.788
Then let's bring his kid back
in for questioning again.

23:13.820 --> 23:15.913
How can she do that?
Do what?

23:15.960 --> 23:19.157
Put her son up there
like that.
She doesn't want to.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.828
That's why she has me.

23:20.860 --> 23:23.988
Tell him $21 million
and he'll have joint custody.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.839
(sighs)
What's going on?

23:31.870 --> 23:32.939
You find out anything?

23:32.970 --> 23:34.904
She's having an affair.

23:36.140 --> 23:38.472
With who, the lawyer?

23:38.510 --> 23:40.000
KALINDA: I don't know.
She has a meeting

23:40.050 --> 23:42.814
arranged this weekend
at a Rolling Crest Suites

23:42.850 --> 23:45.114
in Lake Forest--
room 333.

23:45.150 --> 23:48.017
That would explain why
he's fighting so hard.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.119
Bishop doesn't know
yet, does he?

23:50.160 --> 23:51.855
I don't think so.

23:51.890 --> 23:54.051
But it's only
a matter of time.

24:11.510 --> 24:13.000
Everything all right?

24:17.080 --> 24:20.140
I think I've just
been cured of love.

24:21.790 --> 24:23.951
Oh, no, it's not her.

24:23.990 --> 24:26.254
Lawyers have a way
of making things...

24:26.290 --> 24:27.689
ugly.

24:27.730 --> 24:28.799
(chuckles)

24:28.830 --> 24:31.765
If there's one thing I've
learned in my business:

24:31.800 --> 24:33.768
lawyers don't act
on their own.

24:33.800 --> 24:34.937
(elevator bell dings)

24:34.970 --> 24:35.766
GRACE:
Wait!

24:35.800 --> 24:38.234
One second!

24:38.270 --> 24:39.828
Have you met
Zach's girlfriend?

24:39.870 --> 24:41.007
Yeah, why?

24:41.040 --> 24:42.007
She's black.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.940
Becca?

24:43.980 --> 24:47.108
(laughs)
No. Nisa.

24:47.150 --> 24:48.970
Who's Nisa?

24:49.020 --> 24:50.214
Zach's girlfriend.

24:50.250 --> 24:51.911
Since when?

24:51.950 --> 24:53.178
November.

24:53.220 --> 24:54.812
She's really sweet.

24:54.860 --> 24:57.112
I think her dad's from,
like, Somalia or something.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.821
But her mom lives here.

24:58.860 --> 25:00.657
Zach's gonna bring her
to Dad's speech at school.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.292
He really wants
Dad to meet her.

25:02.330 --> 25:03.820
And...

25:03.870 --> 25:06.065
I met this really
nice guy on line.

25:06.100 --> 25:07.294
Jimmy Patrick.

25:07.330 --> 25:08.797
He's black, too.

25:08.840 --> 25:09.966
Okay, you're
making this up now.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.059
No, I'm not.
The Florrick children

25:12.110 --> 25:13.839
just really love
black people.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.201
(elevator buzzes)

25:16.240 --> 25:18.208
You kids are evil!

25:18.250 --> 25:20.241
(grunting)

25:27.320 --> 25:28.912
Mr. Gardner.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.587
Why are you doing this?

25:30.630 --> 25:32.052
What?

25:32.090 --> 25:33.318
Grand jury.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.089
What do you want?

25:35.130 --> 25:37.792
Why do you think
I want anything?

25:37.830 --> 25:39.263
Look, I've been
granted immunity.

25:39.300 --> 25:42.838
I gotta tell the truth.

25:42.870 --> 25:44.838
Kalinda didn't
hurt that doctor.

25:44.870 --> 25:46.861
You know we didn't
order anything.

25:46.910 --> 25:48.229
That's not really true.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.929
You told me to go kneecap him.

25:49.980 --> 25:52.141
I'm guessing you told
Kalinda the same thing.

25:53.310 --> 25:56.040
That's what you're
hanging your hat on, huh?

25:56.080 --> 25:57.240
An inept metaphor?

25:57.280 --> 25:58.986
I don't work in metaphors.

25:59.020 --> 26:00.988
It's kind of like
at your old firm--

26:01.020 --> 26:04.023
I was told
to cover up your theft.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.598
Okay, now you're getting
in dangerous territory.

26:10.630 --> 26:14.066
I remember using a lot
of metaphors back then.

26:14.100 --> 26:15.965
I was your "life preserver."

26:16.000 --> 26:18.798
I was your, uh,
"ace in the hole."

26:18.840 --> 26:20.705
We agree.

26:20.740 --> 26:23.038
I paid my debt.

26:28.080 --> 26:30.014
I've been subpoenaed.

26:30.050 --> 26:32.211
I gotta answer honestly.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.887
ELI:
But you didn't want

26:37.930 --> 26:40.797
the kids involved
in the campaign.
And they're not.

26:40.830 --> 26:44.618
Um, Peter is speaking
at Zach's school.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.991
That's right.
I don't think
you quite realize

26:47.030 --> 26:49.032
how Zach could be
involved in this story.

26:49.070 --> 26:51.061
You said you didn't
want them involved,

26:51.110 --> 26:53.066
and I am trying
to honor that.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.068
Okay.

26:56.110 --> 26:57.771
Thank you.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.088
How are you doing?

27:10.060 --> 27:12.358
I hear it's a new day here.

27:12.390 --> 27:13.891
It is.

27:13.930 --> 27:15.124
And Peter, too.

27:15.160 --> 27:16.821
He's winning.

27:16.860 --> 27:19.294
It'll still be close;
it's Chicago.

27:19.330 --> 27:22.367
Do you know
where you'll live?

27:22.400 --> 27:24.664
Where I'll...?

27:24.710 --> 27:26.837
After the election.

27:26.870 --> 27:28.735
You'll be able
to afford more.

27:28.780 --> 27:30.133
Move out of the apartment

27:30.180 --> 27:33.399
and get back to where
you were before.

27:33.450 --> 27:35.008
(knocking on door)

27:41.090 --> 27:43.115
I just got a call.

27:43.160 --> 27:44.388
The grand jury?

27:44.430 --> 27:46.159
No. Cary.

27:46.190 --> 27:49.227
That's our deal.

27:49.260 --> 27:51.296
You do know that I'm an attorney
with Lockhart/Gardner.

27:51.330 --> 27:52.467
We do know that.

27:52.500 --> 27:54.798
It's a deal we'd advise
Kalinda to take.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.990
We have a_witness
who can nail Kalinda

27:57.040 --> 27:59.759
for putting
Dr. Booth into a coma.

27:59.810 --> 28:01.937
GLENN: Two years minimum.
On the other hand,

28:01.980 --> 28:04.175
you testify against
Lockhart/Gardner,

28:04.210 --> 28:05.302
we'll grant you
full immunity.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.045
You lost. Get over it.

28:11.220 --> 28:12.778
Mrs. Florrick is incorrect
in thinking

28:12.820 --> 28:14.151
this is about
her husband's campaign.

28:14.190 --> 28:17.216
I've not made it about
her husband's campaign.

28:17.260 --> 28:19.228
In fact...
I have been meticulous

28:19.260 --> 28:22.149
in keeping the two separate.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.191
Kalinda Sharma,
on the other hand,

28:24.230 --> 28:25.788
has a decision to make.

28:25.830 --> 28:29.197
Turn evidence
against the law firm

28:29.240 --> 28:31.800
or get indicted
and serve two years.

28:40.050 --> 28:41.278
Hi, Mrs. Florrick.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.469
Hi, Nisa.

28:42.520 --> 28:43.782
How's everything at school?

28:43.820 --> 28:45.185
Good.

28:45.220 --> 28:47.279
My parents aren't happy
about the shorter Fridays.

28:47.320 --> 28:48.252
Nobody is.

28:48.290 --> 28:49.917
They're starting a petition,

28:49.960 --> 28:51.086
if you want to sign.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.085
Sure.

28:52.130 --> 28:54.018
Dad's coming to campus Monday.
Are you coming?

28:54.060 --> 28:55.152
I can't. I have to work.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.258
But, Zach, I need

28:56.300 --> 28:58.723
to talk to you
for a minute.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.266
The press may want to ask you
a few questions on campus.

29:05.310 --> 29:07.198
I don't want to get
you involved,

29:07.240 --> 29:09.435
_so I'll ask Dad not to
p0int you out either, okay?

29:09.480 --> 29:12.176
Okay.
Nobody will care, though.

29:12.210 --> 29:13.768
I know, but I'll care.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.970
I haven't wanted
you guys involved in this.

29:16.020 --> 29:18.488
GRACE: Eli asked you
to talk to him, didn't he?

29:20.190 --> 29:22.249
Hey, but this is
not about Zach.

29:22.290 --> 29:24.087
It's about his girlfriend.

29:24.130 --> 29:26.086
ALICIA (whispering):
Grace...

29:26.130 --> 29:28.496
(door closes)

29:28.530 --> 29:31.522
(muffled conversation)

29:34.600 --> 29:37.091
Eli doesn't want anybody
involved who's black.

29:37.140 --> 29:40.337
I told him that Zach has an
African-American girlfriend.

29:40.370 --> 29:42.406
That's why he talked
to you, right?

29:42.440 --> 29:44.169
ZACH:
This is about Nisa?

29:44.210 --> 29:46.303
No... I don't know.

29:46.350 --> 29:48.568
That is... so wrong.

29:48.620 --> 29:49.973
You should
tell Eli off.

29:50.020 --> 29:52.511
Okay, both of you
just calm down.

29:52.550 --> 29:54.188
What can I tell Nisa?

29:54.220 --> 29:57.212
Nisa, can you stay for dinner?

29:57.260 --> 30:00.354
I don't know.
I'll call my mom.

30:00.390 --> 30:02.449
Okay.

30:02.500 --> 30:05.060
What's up?

30:05.100 --> 30:06.226
Eli, we need to talk.

30:06.270 --> 30:09.296
Drop by my office tomorrow.

30:09.340 --> 30:11.228
The house in
Lincoln Park,

30:11.270 --> 30:12.908
the summer home
in Boca Raton,

30:12.940 --> 30:14.532
titled in her name;

30:14.580 --> 30:17.902
spousal support
of $100,000 a month

30:17.950 --> 30:20.009
till the children
reach majority,

30:20.050 --> 30:22.245
and shared custody.

30:22.280 --> 30:26.216
I think it's too generous,
but there you go.

30:26.250 --> 30:28.354
We'll pass.

30:31.290 --> 30:33.019
Vastly improved numbers
for starters.

30:33.060 --> 30:34.459
As I think we've
now established,

30:34.500 --> 30:36.252
Mr. Bishop's
financial resources

30:36.300 --> 30:37.494
are apparently
limitless.

30:37.530 --> 30:40.192
She gets
primary custody.

30:40.230 --> 30:42.369
He can see his kids
two weekends a month.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.937
DAVID: The_offer is not
gomg to improve.

30:44.970 --> 30:47.268
We'll see what
a court has to say.

30:47.310 --> 30:48.231
Katrina, this is not
a good idea.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.531
Please...

30:49.580 --> 30:51.207
talk to me, not my client.

30:54.380 --> 30:56.245
And down
the rabbit hole we go.

30:56.280 --> 30:59.249
The judicial process
will take over now.

30:59.290 --> 31:01.417
The good news is that your wife
is hosed financially.

31:01.460 --> 31:04.088
Your legitimate businesses
are worthless on paper.

31:04.130 --> 31:05.529
And now that we're out
of mediation,

31:05.560 --> 31:08.051
we'll be able to preclude
mention of any assets

31:08.100 --> 31:09.294
th_at_could lead
to criminal exposure.

31:09.330 --> 31:11.992
And my son--

31:12.030 --> 31:14.294
at trial--

31:14.340 --> 31:17.867
will he have to testify?

31:22.040 --> 31:23.598
Thank you.

31:29.220 --> 31:30.471
You crossed the line.

31:32.450 --> 31:34.418
Which one?

31:34.460 --> 31:38.419
You don't want Zach being seen
with his black girlfriend?

31:38.460 --> 31:42.191
It's not what I want.

31:42.230 --> 31:44.391
Polling shows Peter will lose

31:44.430 --> 31:47.297
if we don't have the blue
collar and the suburban vote.

31:47.330 --> 31:49.298
And they don't like
black girlfriends?

31:49.340 --> 31:52.400
They don't like people
they can't relate to.

31:52.440 --> 31:56.501
It makes you look
too... cosmopolitan.

31:56.540 --> 32:00.476
You don't know what voters
want or think or anything.

32:00.510 --> 32:01.670
You just make this stuff up

32:01.720 --> 32:03.472
based on whatever biases

32:03.520 --> 32:05.943
you have swirling around
in your head at that moment.

32:05.990 --> 32:07.139
I wish that were true.

32:07.190 --> 32:09.351
Well, you know what's true?

32:09.390 --> 32:12.086
Zach is going to Peter's
speech with Nisa.

32:15.130 --> 32:16.449
Do you know how crazy this is?

32:16.500 --> 32:18.525
For the last six months,
I've been asking you

32:18.570 --> 32:20.629
to let me put the kids
in front of the cameras,

32:20.670 --> 32:22.331
and you have said no--

32:22.370 --> 32:24.509
until I want them not
in front of the cameras,

32:24.540 --> 32:26.007
and now you want the opposite.

32:26.040 --> 32:28.406
Yeah, Eli,
it's all about you.

32:35.380 --> 32:37.678
MEDKIFF:
We're the next case up.

32:37.720 --> 32:40.439
I'm sorry mediation has
failed you, Mr. Bishop.

32:41.690 --> 32:45.979
I hope it hasn't soured you
on the need for compromise.

32:46.030 --> 32:49.693
I always tell myself, "Say a yes
for every time you say a no

32:49.730 --> 32:52.062
and you'll be a happier person."
Y-You understand what I mean.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.499
No.

32:53.530 --> 32:55.339
Well, I guess
what I mean is,

32:55.370 --> 32:57.395
if we can all work
together, toward
the same goals,

32:57.440 --> 33:00.068
each in our own way,
then everyone

33:00.110 --> 33:01.372
can feel like
they had a--

33:01.410 --> 33:02.399
You killed her.

33:03.540 --> 33:04.472
You did it.
What?

33:04.510 --> 33:06.341
She O.D.'d last night.

33:06.380 --> 33:08.143
She's been clean
for ten years

33:08.180 --> 33:09.147
and what, she just decided
to start using again?

33:09.180 --> 33:10.147
Oh, my God.

33:10.180 --> 33:11.147
Okay, where did
you hear this?

33:11.190 --> 33:12.543
You did it.
You killed her.

33:12.590 --> 33:14.649
I'd watch my words, friend.

33:14.690 --> 33:16.351
I didn't
touch her.

33:16.390 --> 33:18.324
But you get
everything now, right?

33:18.360 --> 33:20.089
I mean, you get full custody.

33:20.130 --> 33:21.449
And you get the cash.

33:21.500 --> 33:22.489
Okay, let's take this
out of the hall.

33:22.530 --> 33:26.489
You're a murderer.
Stop this now.

33:26.530 --> 33:28.236
Don't say another word.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.571
Did you have something else
you'd like to share?

33:39.380 --> 33:41.143
Good.

33:54.530 --> 33:56.225
ALICIA:
You ready?

33:56.260 --> 33:58.694
No matter what they ask--
the Fifth.

33:58.730 --> 34:00.163
You plead the Fifth.

34:00.200 --> 34:01.394
Got it.

34:03.540 --> 34:05.508
Do you swear
to tell the truth,

34:05.540 --> 34:07.064
the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth,

34:07.110 --> 34:08.236
so help you God?

34:08.280 --> 34:10.771
I do.

34:10.810 --> 34:12.778
Now, we've asked
Blake Calamar back

34:12.810 --> 34:15.142
for another day of questioning,
but you have no disagreement

34:15.180 --> 34:16.716
with his characterization
of the conversation?

34:16.750 --> 34:20.379
I refuse to answer
on the grounds

34:20.420 --> 34:21.182
that it may
incriminate me.

34:21.220 --> 34:22.209
Again, we would
speed things up here

34:22.260 --> 34:24.785
if you allowed for a blanket
pleading of the Fifth.

34:24.830 --> 34:27.458
And again, we would ask
that Miss Sharma's attorney

34:27.490 --> 34:30.721
honor the Illinois
state statute.

34:32.430 --> 34:35.160
Mr. Calamar testified
that you beat Dr. Booth

34:35.200 --> 34:37.339
with a bat.

34:37.370 --> 34:38.803
And then you
gave that weapon

34:38.840 --> 34:40.467
to him to hide.
Is that true?

34:40.510 --> 34:42.569
I refuse to answer

34:42.610 --> 34:43.804
on the grounds that it
may incriminate me.

34:43.840 --> 34:46.343
You then,
according to Mr. Calamar,

34:46.380 --> 34:47.642
took that same bat
back from him

34:47.680 --> 34:49.341
after knocking him unconscious.
Is that true?

34:49.380 --> 34:51.245
I refuse to answer
on the grounds

34:51.290 --> 34:52.348
that it may
incriminate me.

34:52.390 --> 34:53.539
And since that time,

34:53.590 --> 34:55.558
have you ever tried
to contact Mr. Calamar?

34:57.390 --> 34:59.381
Can you ask me
that again, please?

35:10.570 --> 35:11.662
Why, certainly, Miss Sharma.

35:11.710 --> 35:12.631
I asked, "Since that time,

35:12.670 --> 35:14.570
have you ever tried
to contact Mr. Calamar?"

35:14.610 --> 35:17.579
Yes.

35:17.610 --> 35:18.645
I'd like to speak
to my client.

35:18.680 --> 35:19.578
No, Mrs. Florrick.

35:19.610 --> 35:21.749
Your client wishes
to answer the question.

35:21.780 --> 35:24.385
Go ahead.

35:26.620 --> 35:29.817
I tried to speak
to him a few days ago.

35:29.860 --> 35:32.556
I followed him

35:32.590 --> 35:36.549
to the hotel,
but he was meeting someone.

35:36.600 --> 35:39.660
And this hotel
where you followed him?

35:39.700 --> 35:40.769
What hotel was that?

35:42.700 --> 35:43.735
It was a Lake... um...

35:43.770 --> 35:46.534
It was, uh, Rolling Crest
Suites in Lake Forest.

35:46.570 --> 35:50.574
Uh... room 333.

35:50.610 --> 35:53.704
You said you tried
to speak to Mr. Calamar.

35:53.750 --> 35:55.615
So what prevented you?

35:55.650 --> 35:57.572
I saw that Mr. Calamar
was meeting

35:57.620 --> 35:58.848
with_an African-
American woman,

35:58.890 --> 36:01.381
so I did not contact him.

36:01.420 --> 36:04.218
CARY: And why did you
try to contact him?

36:04.260 --> 36:05.852
'Cause I wanted to ask him

36:05.890 --> 36:09.496
why he was lying about
me to a grand jury.

36:09.530 --> 36:13.364
And if... ifI was
this grand jury,

36:13.400 --> 36:15.960
I would be asking him
the same questions.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.867
My guess is Mr. Calamar
won't even return here

36:18.910 --> 36:20.707
after he hears
my testimony.

36:27.880 --> 36:30.246
Did you really just do
what I think you did?

36:30.280 --> 36:32.248
What do you think
I just did?

36:32.290 --> 36:35.817
Suggested that Blake
was the one sleeping
with Bishop's wife.

36:35.860 --> 36:38.328
Look, the lighting
at the Rolling Crest
Suites was so dark,

36:38.360 --> 36:40.988
it could've been Blake.

36:41.030 --> 36:44.693
(phone ringing)

36:44.730 --> 36:45.765
Alicia Florrick.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.222
This is Cary Agos.

36:47.270 --> 36:48.737
How is your day going?

36:48.770 --> 36:49.896
Fine, Cary.

36:49.940 --> 36:51.601
How's
yours?

36:51.640 --> 36:53.562
Ah, I think
I got a cold coming on.

36:53.610 --> 36:55.669
Well, I'm really sorry
to hear that.

36:55.710 --> 36:56.631
Another subpoena?

36:56.680 --> 36:57.772
Well, oddly, no.

36:57.810 --> 37:01.519
Blake Calamar, during his last
visit to the grand jury,

37:01.550 --> 37:03.415
was asked _
some follow-up questions

37:03.450 --> 37:05.247
based on Miss Sharma's
testimony,

37:05.290 --> 37:06.882
and you'll just never guess
what happened.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.888
I think I have an idea.

37:08.920 --> 37:10.717
He asked for a brief recess,

37:10.760 --> 37:12.887
and didn't return
to the grand jury room.

37:12.930 --> 37:15.398
Now, he's our only witness

37:15.430 --> 37:17.694
against Miss Sharma, so for now,
we will not need her to return.

37:17.730 --> 37:19.789
Thank you, Cary.

37:19.830 --> 37:20.797
I'll let her know.

37:20.830 --> 37:22.536
Do.

37:31.410 --> 37:32.638
How are you, Cary?

37:32.680 --> 37:35.649
I don't know.

37:37.680 --> 37:40.615
May be tough sledding here
for a while.

37:40.650 --> 37:42.515
Well, good luck.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.585
Thank you.

37:48.330 --> 37:50.719
* Everything I love...

37:50.760 --> 37:52.796
Look at you.

37:52.830 --> 37:55.537
Your daughter's not going
to be very happy with you.

37:55.570 --> 37:57.458
No. She thinks I
drink too much wine.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.502
This is tequila.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.376
Cary was in on
it, wasn't he?

38:04.410 --> 38:05.707
He knew what to ask you.

38:05.750 --> 38:08.719
Cary's a great guy.

38:08.750 --> 38:10.718
Oh, listen to you.

38:10.750 --> 38:12.786
* You and Cary,
sitting in a tree... *

38:12.820 --> 38:14.754
Hey, I'm just
shoring up friends.

38:16.420 --> 38:17.853
For what?

38:17.890 --> 38:19.448
For the end days.

38:19.490 --> 38:21.424
Hmm.

38:24.830 --> 38:26.491
I have to buy
a big house.

38:26.530 --> 38:28.395
You have to?

38:28.440 --> 38:30.431
For appearances.
I don't know.

38:33.370 --> 38:36.339
I have to stop life from
just happening, don't I?

38:36.380 --> 38:39.508
I don't want to
buy a big house.

38:39.550 --> 38:40.778
I like my apartment.

38:40.810 --> 38:43.517
Yeah, I like it too.

38:43.550 --> 38:47.111
I used to have
so many friends.

38:47.150 --> 38:48.811
Where are they now?

38:48.860 --> 38:51.681
Now you lost me.

38:51.730 --> 38:53.982
Back then, my old life,
the big house?

38:54.030 --> 38:56.351
I had all these...

38:56.400 --> 38:57.822
mom friends.

38:57.860 --> 38:59.725
All talking
about our weight.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.660
Yeah, I wish I
knew you back then.

39:03.700 --> 39:05.429
No.

39:05.470 --> 39:06.732
I was... different.

39:06.770 --> 39:08.704
We would've
hated each other.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.778
Life changes, doesn't it?

39:13.810 --> 39:15.778
Yeah, it does.

39:15.820 --> 39:19.916
We can change it back.

39:19.950 --> 39:22.054
We can do
what we want.

39:22.090 --> 39:24.456
Hm.

39:24.490 --> 39:26.128
(phone blips)

39:27.960 --> 39:29.928
Who's that?

39:29.960 --> 39:31.120
Blake.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.821
You're kidding.

39:32.870 --> 39:35.498
Nope. He wants to meet.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.861
Well, you're
not going to.

39:37.900 --> 39:39.731
Kalinda...

40:00.890 --> 40:02.152
(laughing)

40:02.200 --> 40:03.849
Hey, slugger.

40:03.900 --> 40:04.992
I heard you
were heading home.

40:05.030 --> 40:07.726
Yeah, yeah,
thanks for that.

40:07.770 --> 40:09.863
I felt you needed
a little encouragement.

40:09.900 --> 40:11.902
Yeah, well, having Bishop

40:11.940 --> 40:14.773
after you for sleeping
with his wife, that's...

40:14.810 --> 40:16.004
that's encouraging.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.576
Don't be a sore loser.

40:17.610 --> 40:19.908
Well, I--

40:19.950 --> 40:21.008
I finally got Leela.

40:21.050 --> 40:22.779
You finally got her.

40:22.820 --> 40:25.015
Yeah, I finally
understood.

40:25.050 --> 40:26.745
Well, good for you.

40:26.790 --> 40:28.451
It's a little bit too late,
though, isn't it?

40:28.490 --> 40:29.787
Not really.

40:29.820 --> 40:31.458
Met with an ASA
this afternoon--

40:31.490 --> 40:33.219
one last interview
to fill them in.

40:33.260 --> 40:35.956
What do you want,
a medal?
You see,

40:36.000 --> 40:37.058
I thought it was about why.

40:37.100 --> 40:38.920
Why you changed your name.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.858
I thought there was some deep,
dark secret in your past,

40:40.900 --> 40:43.733
but there really wasn't.

40:43.770 --> 40:45.761
You just got bored
with your old life.

40:45.810 --> 40:49.075
Yep, that's me,
boring as they come.

40:49.110 --> 40:51.977
But then I realized
it wasn't about why.

40:52.010 --> 40:53.500
It was about who.

40:55.550 --> 40:58.747
Who helped you
change your name?

40:58.790 --> 41:00.678
'Cause I was looking
for clues out there,

41:00.720 --> 41:04.486
and there were none,
and it was odd.

41:04.530 --> 41:05.929
Then I realized
that was the clue.

41:05.960 --> 41:07.222
Could we speed this up?

41:07.260 --> 41:08.852
See, someone helped
you cover up the clues.

41:08.900 --> 41:12.563
The biggest clue of all
ended up being you, though.

41:13.600 --> 41:15.033
You have a tell.

41:15.070 --> 41:16.935
We into tells now?

41:16.970 --> 41:18.460
You overreact.

41:19.970 --> 41:23.030
So I thought back to all
the times you overreacted.

41:23.080 --> 41:27.141
When I told Alicia about
Leela, you destroyed my car.

41:27.180 --> 41:30.047
When I asked you
what Alicia knew,

41:30.080 --> 41:32.583
you went psycho.

41:32.620 --> 41:33.882
Alicia.

41:33.920 --> 41:35.683
It's about Alicia.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.915
That's what you
care about.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.257
Go home.

41:39.290 --> 41:41.758
Peter helped you
change your name

41:41.800 --> 41:43.597
at the state's attorney's
office, when you worked there.

41:43.630 --> 41:47.589
Peter helped you
change your name.

41:47.630 --> 41:49.029
And then you
slept with him.

41:52.110 --> 41:55.079
Peter covered up
everything for you.

41:55.110 --> 41:56.805
For Leela.

41:56.840 --> 42:00.947
And you... slept with him.

42:00.980 --> 42:04.984
You're wrong.

42:05.020 --> 42:07.147
That's good.

42:07.190 --> 42:10.887
Because I told the ASA,

42:10.920 --> 42:12.558
and of course, you know,
they have their process.

42:12.590 --> 42:13.989
They'll probably...

42:14.030 --> 42:18.694
probably interview
everyone involved and...

42:18.730 --> 42:20.721
they'll get it
all straightened out.

42:24.200 --> 42:25.838
See you around,
Kalinda.
