00:13.347 --> 00:15.347
MAN:
Yo, we got company.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.583
¶ ¶
(engine revs)

00:22.089 --> 00:24.323
You got
a death wish,

00:24.325 --> 00:25.741
Duende?

00:25.742 --> 00:27.158
Why, you suddenly got
some balls?

00:27.161 --> 00:28.727
Not as big as your mom's, man.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.162
(laughs, speaks quietly)

00:30.164 --> 00:31.630
Say it again.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.465
Come on,
say it again, bitch.

00:33.466 --> 00:35.299
Man, put that away
before I take it from you, man.

00:35.302 --> 00:37.669
(engine revs, tires squeal)
Listen to your boy, now.
Don't make me embarrass you.

00:39.073 --> 00:40.372
Move it...!

00:58.292 --> 01:00.793
(car horn blaring)

01:37.431 --> 01:39.231
(loud, fake coughing)

01:39.233 --> 01:41.433
Good morning.

01:43.838 --> 01:45.237
What's this?

01:45.239 --> 01:46.505
That was my leftover
Uni Burger

01:46.507 --> 01:48.207
that I was gonna
have for breakfast

01:48.209 --> 01:50.476
until somebody stole it.

01:50.478 --> 01:53.312
Who eats a sea urchin burger,
let alone for breakfast?

01:53.314 --> 01:55.314
You do, apparently.
What makes you think

01:55.316 --> 01:57.783
that I would eat your
disgusting leftovers?
Because I know you, because

01:57.785 --> 02:00.552
you're a scavenger, because
you're a refrigerator hyena.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.821
Let me smell your breath.
What?! Smell your own breath.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.223
Aha!

02:04.225 --> 02:05.257
Fine.

02:06.193 --> 02:09.394
Surprisingly minty.

02:09.396 --> 02:11.130
Sure you know me?
Yeah. Know you so well

02:11.132 --> 02:13.132
to know that even
if you did steal my Uni Burger

02:13.134 --> 02:14.900
you would then do
something super sneaky

02:14.902 --> 02:17.769
like try to cover it up by
using minty fresh mouthwash.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.705
How did they ever give you
a detective's badge?

02:19.707 --> 02:21.640
I'll have you know,
at the LAPD

02:21.642 --> 02:23.943
they used to call me
Sherlock Holmes.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.245
(scoffs) Oh, a fictional
character-- well done.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.313
I also know you
better than you think, missy.
Oh, yeah?

02:28.315 --> 02:30.415
What's my favorite color?
Blue.

02:30.417 --> 02:31.817
Wrong.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.352
Let me be more specific.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.254
Cornflower blue.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.623
That was such a lucky guess.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.291
A lucky guess?
Okay, first off,

02:39.293 --> 02:40.859
that's not even a real color.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.929
And secondly, you don't even own
anything in the cornflower hue.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.931
Not that you know of.
See? Apparently,

02:45.932 --> 02:47.932
you don't know
everything about me.
I know you hate liver

02:47.935 --> 02:50.302
but love bulgogi.
So does everybody else.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.571
I know that your favorite movie
on the planet is<i> Titanic.</i>

02:52.573 --> 02:55.240
Me and a billion
other people.
I know that you love mojitos

02:55.242 --> 02:57.543
and techno music
at the Apex Hotel.

02:57.545 --> 02:58.911
I know that you played
college softball.

02:58.913 --> 03:00.879
I know that you dressed up
like a Teenage Mutant

03:00.881 --> 03:02.514
Ninja Turtle as a kid
for Halloween.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.782
I know that you keep a journal.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.551
I know that you want to have
an oregano garden

03:05.553 --> 03:07.186
even though you are
a noted plant killer.

03:07.188 --> 03:08.787
I know that your favorite
New Kid on the Block

03:08.789 --> 03:11.924
was Joey McIntyre, and why not,
because he was the dreamiest.

03:11.926 --> 03:13.325
(laughs):
Bam.

03:13.327 --> 03:14.593
Oh, and I
also know that

03:14.595 --> 03:18.363
you hide girly magazines
under your bathroom sink.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.333
I do not.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.335
I mean, not like...
<i> girly</i> magazines,

03:23.337 --> 03:25.971
but I mean, like, magazines
for girls-- things like

03:25.973 --> 03:27.272
<i> Cosmo</i> and<i> Modern Bride--</i>

03:27.274 --> 03:29.708
because our kick-ass Kensi-lina

03:29.710 --> 03:32.277
has a softer, lacy, lady side

03:32.279 --> 03:34.346
that no one knows about...

03:34.348 --> 03:36.315
but me.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.950
And I love it.

03:39.987 --> 03:42.387
You couldn't have said that
any creepier.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.723
Creepier?! I thought I was
pretty charming.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.826
(panting): Guys, Granger's been
in an accident.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.795
What happened?

03:49.796 --> 03:51.763
We're still trying
to find out.
Come on, Beale.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.432
Okay. They rushed him
to County.

03:53.434 --> 03:55.300
He was conscious
at the scene,

03:55.302 --> 03:56.401
but that's all
they would tell me.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.869
Show them the crash.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.438
ERIC: A security camera
from a nearby residence

03:59.440 --> 04:00.505
caught the accident.

04:04.712 --> 04:07.913
Oh, my gosh.
He's lucky he
survived that.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.448
KENSI: What was he doing?
We don't know yet.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.782
We're not gonna find out
sitting here.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.484
We'll work the accident scene.
You guys check in

04:12.486 --> 04:13.952
on Granger.
Anybody inform Hetty?

04:13.954 --> 04:15.354
She knows.
What did she say?

04:15.356 --> 04:17.422
Not a damn thing.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.796
CALLEN:
All right, guys.

04:30.304 --> 04:32.738
What do you think
he was doing up here?

04:32.740 --> 04:34.606
Your guess is
as good as mine.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.042
Well, maybe Eric can
backtrack his movements

04:37.044 --> 04:38.844
using traffic cams.
Yeah.

04:38.846 --> 04:41.513
He was driving
way too fast for this road.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.582
There's no way
he could've made that curve.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.651
The witnesses said
it was a single car.

04:45.653 --> 04:47.019
There was no pursuit.

04:47.021 --> 04:48.387
Uh, no skid marks--

04:48.389 --> 04:51.490
he never touched the brakes.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.692
How do you explain this?

04:53.694 --> 04:55.494
I don't know.
Maybe he was injured

04:55.496 --> 04:57.496
and needed to get
to the hospital.

04:57.498 --> 04:58.964
It's the wrong direction.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.734
Something isn't right.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.736
But you got a theory.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.505
Nope.

05:06.507 --> 05:09.408
I know that look--
you're holding out on me.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.976
I got nothing--
except a bad feeling

05:10.978 --> 05:14.012
that this might not
have been an accident.
Well, that goes

05:14.014 --> 05:15.480
without saying.
What else?

05:15.482 --> 05:18.417
First there's
a breach of security.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.819
Hetty's personal data is leaked.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.921
That almost gets her killed.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.489
Now Granger
smashes up his car

05:24.491 --> 05:26.325
in the middle
of the night,

05:26.327 --> 05:27.893
15 miles from his house?

05:27.895 --> 05:30.395
Are you kidding me?
Could be unrelated.

05:30.397 --> 05:32.798
Could be.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.534
Could<i> also</i> be...

05:35.536 --> 05:37.803
we really do have a mole.

05:39.606 --> 05:42.607
(groans): Oh, I hate it
when she does this.
Does what?

05:42.609 --> 05:44.543
That.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.547
She's having a cup of tea.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.882
It's her sixth one.
Well,

05:50.884 --> 05:52.884
maybe she's thirsty.
Maybe she's worried sick
about Granger.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.820
I think one of us
should talk to her.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.521
Be my guest.
And by "one of us,"

05:56.523 --> 05:58.724
I mean you.
Hetty likes you.

05:58.726 --> 06:01.493
Oh, come on.
She likes you, too.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.428
She tolerates me.

06:03.430 --> 06:04.429
(scoffs)

06:04.431 --> 06:05.664
Look, if Hetty wanted

06:05.666 --> 06:08.533
to talk to one of us,
she would.

06:08.535 --> 06:09.801
So you're not gonna do it?

06:09.803 --> 06:12.070
No.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.005
Fine.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.107
(sighs)

06:15.109 --> 06:18.577
(slowly drumming fingers)

06:21.482 --> 06:23.048
I'm doing it.

06:23.050 --> 06:26.785
Really don't think
that's a good idea.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.554
But... you're
gonna do it anyway.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.556
Knock, knock.
(nervous chuckle)

06:31.558 --> 06:33.492
Who's there? Hetty.
(nervous chuckle)

06:33.494 --> 06:34.626
Hey.

06:34.628 --> 06:35.894
(sighs)

06:35.896 --> 06:38.063
(British accent):
Having a spot of tea, are we?

06:38.065 --> 06:39.831
Pip, pip, cheerio.
Jolly good.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.802
So, I'm just checking in,
you know,

06:43.804 --> 06:45.604
see if you need anything.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.441
All right, you know what?

06:49.443 --> 06:50.675
Figured as much.

06:50.677 --> 06:53.745
Just checking, and,
uh, wanted to say

06:53.747 --> 06:55.747
that...

06:55.749 --> 06:58.850
I'm sure the assistant director
will be just fine.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.887
I will be upstairs
in Ops.

07:01.889 --> 07:05.624
Which is where
I'm going right now.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.626
Mr. Beale...

07:09.596 --> 07:13.031
...keep your eyes... open

07:13.033 --> 07:16.701
and your wits about you today.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.539
Okay.

07:20.541 --> 07:21.540
And, um...

07:21.542 --> 07:22.741
Eric?

07:22.743 --> 07:24.509
Mm-hmm?

07:24.511 --> 07:26.044
Thank you.

07:28.182 --> 07:30.081
You're welcome.

07:32.753 --> 07:36.054
DEEKS:
<i> Why is he in restraints?</i>

07:36.056 --> 07:37.889
There was a
safety concern.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.691
He's a federal agent.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.893
NURSE:
Are you next of kin?
We're coworkers.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.695
NURSE: I'm sorry,
I can't discuss this

07:43.697 --> 07:44.863
with you.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.131
You know what?
We're NCIS,

07:46.133 --> 07:48.533
and we're investigating--
we need some answers.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.135
I'll get
the attending physician.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.304
Thank you.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.472
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Nurse Carson to Four West
Nurses Station.

07:54.475 --> 07:58.043
Nurse Carson to Four West
Nurses Station.

07:58.045 --> 08:00.512
Assistant Director?

08:00.514 --> 08:01.947
It's Agent Blye.
Can you hear me?

08:01.949 --> 08:03.215
Hey, buddy.

08:03.217 --> 08:05.584
How's our favorite
little curmudgeon?

08:05.586 --> 08:06.785
You gave us quite the scare.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.487
Where am I?

08:08.489 --> 08:09.855
Right now, where am I?

08:09.857 --> 08:12.757
You're, uh,
you're in the hospital.

08:12.759 --> 08:13.859
You were
in an accident, Granger.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.894
Don't... You don't
have to take that off.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.129
Don't take that--
that's the I.V.-- please, not--
No, no, no.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.631
We want to keep that on there,
'cause the nurse--
Don't do that.

08:19.633 --> 08:20.632
Take your hands
off me!

08:20.634 --> 08:21.700
Granger!
KENSI:
Whoa!

08:21.702 --> 08:24.503
Whoa. Relax. Relax.
You're okay.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.538
Listen, it's not safe.
It's not safe.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.673
We have to go to...
(muttering)
Let go of me.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.809
Just go. Listen, just...
Let go of me.
Granger...

08:30.811 --> 08:32.611
Let me go.
It's okay.
Granger, Granger...

08:32.613 --> 08:34.363
Let go of me.
Let go.
Stop... Granger...

08:34.364 --> 08:36.114
(alarm blaring)
Granger, just re... he's going
for my weapon-- he's got...

08:36.116 --> 08:37.148
No, no! No, no!

08:37.150 --> 08:38.683
What the hell is going on here?

08:38.685 --> 08:39.918
Who removed
his restraint?

08:39.920 --> 08:42.153
GRANGER:
Get away! Let go of me!
Move it!

08:42.155 --> 08:43.839
Let go!

08:43.840 --> 08:45.524
DOCTOR:
Give me ten cc's of Midazolam.

08:45.526 --> 08:46.958
Clear the room!
Clear the room!

08:46.960 --> 08:48.527
Okay. Whoa!

08:48.529 --> 08:49.861
What's happening? What's going
on with him right now?

08:49.863 --> 08:51.796
He had a seizure! Go!

08:51.798 --> 08:53.798
(Granger groaning)
MAN: I got him. I got him.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.834
Hold him down!
Hold him down!
(Granger grunts, groans)

08:55.836 --> 08:57.869
(grunting, growling)

09:10.617 --> 09:13.618
(monitor beeping steadily)

09:13.620 --> 09:16.555
He was restrained for his safety
as well as our own.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.657
Sorry-- he's
not normally like that.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.325
What's wrong with him?

09:20.327 --> 09:22.160
He's in an altered state.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.229
We just don't know why;
we're still running tests.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.197
He may have suffered
a head injury

09:26.199 --> 09:27.599
from the collision.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.968
Do you know if he was
on any medications?

09:29.970 --> 09:31.803
No, not that we know of.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.805
What about drugs
or alcohol?

09:33.807 --> 09:37.309
I mean, he has a cocktail
once in a while, but no drugs.

09:37.311 --> 09:38.843
You sure?

09:40.347 --> 09:43.315
Any family history
of mental illness?

09:43.317 --> 09:45.283
Um...
(stammers)

09:45.285 --> 09:47.052
You two work with him,

09:47.054 --> 09:49.254
but you don't really know
anything about him.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.956
He's a pretty
private person.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.091
I don't think you
go around telling...

09:53.093 --> 09:54.626
Tox screen's back.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.361
Thank you.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.030
Anything?

10:01.969 --> 10:03.935
He was poisoned.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.905
SAM:
<i> What kind of poison?</i>

10:06.907 --> 10:08.239
KENSI (over radio):
They're retesting,

10:08.241 --> 10:10.275
but they think it's something
called Aconitine.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.711
Monkshood?
How the hell
did he get that?

10:12.713 --> 10:14.279
They haven't
determined that yet.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.846
SAM: We need to search
his car and his houses.

10:15.849 --> 10:18.383
Hey, have her hazmat team
also check his office,

10:18.385 --> 10:20.151
but do it on the down low.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.753
If somebody on the inside's
responsible for this,

10:21.755 --> 10:23.989
we don't want to tip them off
that we're onto them.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.024
Got it.

10:27.628 --> 10:30.362
You look like you're
ready to kill somebody.

10:30.364 --> 10:32.197
I am.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.336
KENSI: I couldn't quite
put my finger on it but...

10:38.338 --> 10:40.772
you know what it is?

10:40.774 --> 10:42.707
Something's still bothering me.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.776
What do mean,
about Granger?
No, about you.

10:44.778 --> 10:47.045
How would you know about
my magazines if you weren't

10:47.047 --> 10:49.047
snooping under my sink?
(chuckles)
Oh. All right.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.349
I wasn't snooping under
your sink. I was looking for

10:51.351 --> 10:53.185
toilet paper, which is
something, evidently,

10:53.186 --> 10:55.020
you never do, because every
time I come to your house,

10:55.022 --> 10:57.022
I have to put toilet
paper on the roll.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.057
How hard is that? Come on,
it takes, like, two seconds.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.659
Are you serious?
One step,

11:00.661 --> 11:02.411
you take it, and two,
you put it on the thing

11:02.412 --> 11:04.162
and you're done.
What difference does it make
if it's on the counter

11:04.164 --> 11:06.431
or if it's on
the actual roll?
Um, principle.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.299
Why are you so obsessed
with toilet paper?
(scoffs)

11:08.301 --> 11:10.068
Did you have some sort of
traumatic event as a kid

11:10.070 --> 11:11.803
that-that... with
potty training?

11:11.805 --> 11:13.938
Is this why you don't
pee in public toilets?

11:13.940 --> 11:15.874
Wait, who doesn't pee
in public toilets?
Uh, Deeks.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.276
I don't blame him.
Thank you. At least
I'm not the one

11:18.278 --> 11:21.713
that pees in takeout containers
for food on a stakeout.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.982
A girl's got to do
what a girl's got to do.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.684
Nell, what do you got?

11:25.686 --> 11:29.354
Aconitine-- it's a highly
poisonous alkaloid

11:29.356 --> 11:33.291
whose chemical makeup
is C34-H47-NO11.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.226
It's basically
a neurotoxin

11:35.228 --> 11:37.696
that is absorbed
via mucous membrane--

11:37.698 --> 11:40.465
nostrils, lips, mouth,
but also via skin.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.734
Depending on the level of
exposure, it can cause

11:42.736 --> 11:46.137
severe diarrhea, pain,
paralysis, vomiting...

11:46.139 --> 11:47.872
and eventual cardiac arrest.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.941
Sounds like your chili.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.411
Where would somebody
get their hands on this?

11:53.413 --> 11:55.146
That's the easy part.
It occurs in nature.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.182
It comes from

11:57.184 --> 11:58.983
the aconitum plant,
also known as

11:58.985 --> 12:00.852
monkshood
or wolfsbane.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.854
Actually,
in "ye olden days,"

12:02.856 --> 12:05.223
they used the poison
to kill wolves,

12:05.225 --> 12:07.492
which is why everyone
knows that wolfsbane is an

12:07.494 --> 12:10.095
effective deterrent
against werewolves.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.463
KENSI:
Deeks.

12:11.465 --> 12:13.798
Hmm? What?

12:13.800 --> 12:16.067
Whoa, what the what?
What is that doing
on your desk?

12:16.069 --> 12:17.469
I thought you
put it there.

12:17.471 --> 12:19.104
Why would I give you
a poisonous plant?

12:19.106 --> 12:21.005
I didn't know it was
poisonous until right now.

12:21.007 --> 12:23.241
Well, I certainly
didn't give it to you.
(sighs)

12:23.243 --> 12:26.177
And don't get closer--
it's got deadly nectar and-and

12:26.179 --> 12:28.012
poisonous pollen
and all sorts of... Don't.

12:28.014 --> 12:30.749
It's only deadly if you
ingest it or touch it.

12:30.751 --> 12:31.983
Then don't...

12:31.985 --> 12:33.384
I'm not.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.453
Nicely work,
Poison Ivy.
See?

12:38.525 --> 12:40.458
Okay, if you didn't
put that on my desk,

12:40.460 --> 12:42.060
then who did?

12:42.062 --> 12:43.461
Probably the same

12:43.463 --> 12:45.530
person that
poisoned Granger.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.142
All right,

12:57.144 --> 12:58.543
appreciate it.

12:58.544 --> 12:59.943
They said they found
traces of the poison,

12:59.946 --> 13:01.179
but nothing near
a lethal dose.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.413
Granger must have
picked it up elsewhere

13:02.415 --> 13:03.882
and carried it home.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.517
See anything
unusual in there?

13:05.519 --> 13:07.452
Nah, guy lives like a monk.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.053
You two could have
been roommates.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.522
I've seen homeless people
with more possessions

13:10.524 --> 13:12.708
than the two
of you combined.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.893
Some of us haven't been seduced
by the trappings of ownership.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.961
Ah. What, have you been
reading self-help books?

13:16.963 --> 13:18.563
To know yourself is
to know the universe.
(phone line ringing)

13:18.565 --> 13:20.431
You know what I know?
You're full of it.
Hello?

13:20.433 --> 13:22.801
Kens, we're at Granger's,
we got nothing.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.502
How are things back there?

13:24.504 --> 13:27.138
Not good.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.808
They found high concentrations
of poison in Granger's office.

13:29.810 --> 13:31.576
In the desk, telephone,
even on the paperwork.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.944
That had to be the source.

13:32.946 --> 13:33.978
Mm-hmm.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.047
There's ano...

13:38.118 --> 13:39.884
There's another thing, too.

13:39.886 --> 13:43.121
Somebody left the plant that the
poison is made from on my desk.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.556
Eric and Nell are checking
surveillance cameras

13:44.558 --> 13:46.057
to try and see
who did it.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.592
You're gonna need to
evacuate the building.

13:47.594 --> 13:50.595
Yeah, I'll inform Hetty.
I'll keep you posted.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.964
Once we evacuate
the building,

13:52.966 --> 13:55.567
Hazmat can
go through it.

13:55.569 --> 13:59.337
I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

13:59.339 --> 14:03.041
This whole place has
to be decontaminated.

14:03.043 --> 14:06.211
I realize that, Mr. Deeks.

14:06.213 --> 14:10.014
I'm just not sure
about evacuating.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.550
Granger is clinging to life
at the hospital as we speak.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.152
This is deadly.

14:14.154 --> 14:17.422
I'm well aware
of its lethality, Ms. Blye.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.524
If you do not

14:19.526 --> 14:21.459
evacuate the building,

14:21.461 --> 14:23.862
everyone is under risk
of being exposed.

14:23.864 --> 14:28.066
And if I do, whoever is
responsible for this,

14:28.068 --> 14:30.001
could escape,

14:30.003 --> 14:32.637
could go on to poison many more

14:32.639 --> 14:34.873
than those of us here today.

14:34.875 --> 14:38.576
Everyone in this building
understands the risks

14:38.578 --> 14:40.879
involved in this job.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.914
And you're willing to make
that choice for them.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.919
That's what I do.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.259
Hetty...

15:00.100 --> 15:03.534
(buzzing, whirring)

15:16.383 --> 15:19.450
We have a mole
in our midst

15:19.452 --> 15:21.519
and it ends today.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.266
Now, I trust Hetty
knows what she's doing.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.135
If the poison's limited
to Granger's office,

15:37.137 --> 15:38.202
the risk should
be minimal.
Yeah.

15:38.204 --> 15:39.504
Uh, it's still a risk.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.239
SAM:
Where are we with suspects?

15:41.241 --> 15:43.174
Eric and Nell are
sorting through everybody.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.143
What about the people
that aren't at work?

15:45.145 --> 15:46.444
Uh, there are three.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.046
So we have, uh,
Deborah Hill,

15:48.048 --> 15:50.065
she's out on
maternity leave.

15:50.066 --> 15:52.083
Edward Stevens is supposedly at
a funeral on the east coast.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.318
And, uh, Lisa Manning,

15:53.320 --> 15:55.553
Granger's assistant,
is home sick

15:55.555 --> 15:58.122
for two days now.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.124
We need to pay Lisa a visit.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.960
Let us know if you
find anything else.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.494
Done.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.964
HETTY:
<i> How are we making out?</i>

16:05.966 --> 16:07.031
Data mining through
everyone, focusing on

16:07.033 --> 16:09.184
our most recent hires.

16:09.185 --> 16:11.336
We're searching for any
suspicious anomalies

16:11.338 --> 16:13.238
in the workplace. Um,

16:13.239 --> 16:15.139
contact with the outside,
travel, finance,

16:15.141 --> 16:17.141
et cetera, but
so far, nothing.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.143
We also went through
the surveillance tapes

16:19.145 --> 16:21.713
to see who put the flower
on Kensi's desk,

16:21.715 --> 16:24.048
but the system was down
for about an hour

16:24.050 --> 16:25.450
for routine
maintenance.

16:25.452 --> 16:26.718
Looks like someone
took advantage

16:26.720 --> 16:28.653
of that window of opportunity.

16:28.655 --> 16:32.323
What about, uh, Inspector
Wallace and her group?

16:32.325 --> 16:34.459
They had
the run of the place

16:34.461 --> 16:37.195
when they were here.

16:37.197 --> 16:40.398
Inspector Wallace
probably saved your life.

16:42.302 --> 16:46.204
But we will
look into them as well.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.373
Meanwhile, I want you
to dust off

16:48.375 --> 16:51.009
your polygraph skills,
Ms. Jones.

16:51.011 --> 16:54.345
I want everyone
in the building boxed.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.648
Myself included.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.118
CALLEN:
Lisa! Lisa Manning!

17:00.120 --> 17:02.186
Agent Callen
and Hanna from work.

17:14.034 --> 17:17.068
She's still breathing...
barely.

17:17.070 --> 17:19.170
Pulse is thready.
(line ringing)

17:19.172 --> 17:21.272
Lisa?

17:21.273 --> 17:23.373
Callen.
Kens, we got Lisa Manning
at her house.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.576
We need an ambulance.

17:25.578 --> 17:28.312
Have you ever given Hetty
a polygraph before?

17:28.314 --> 17:30.048
No.

17:30.050 --> 17:33.117
I don't suppose you could
ask her about Area 51?

17:33.119 --> 17:35.520
Eric, now is not
the time for jokes.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.255
What? Who's joking.

17:37.257 --> 17:40.358
If anyone knows the truth about
alien visitations, it's Hetty.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.260
We have to take advantage
of these situations.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.796
All right, I'll see
what I can do.

17:44.798 --> 17:47.432
(tablet beeps three times)

17:47.434 --> 17:48.833
Did you get something there?

17:48.835 --> 17:52.236
Uh, Nell?

17:52.238 --> 17:56.240
Hey, did you cash in some
investments today?

17:56.242 --> 17:58.276
Me? (exhales)
Last thing I invested in was

17:58.278 --> 18:01.546
<i> Captain America,</i>
volume one, number 74.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.581
And I had to go in
with six other guys.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.116
That's a comic book, right?

18:05.118 --> 18:07.718
Uh, yeah, just
a little old comic book

18:07.720 --> 18:10.188
where Cap is forced to fight
Red Skull to the death--

18:10.190 --> 18:11.189
wait for it--

18:11.191 --> 18:12.190
in Hell.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.842
It's classic.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.493
All right, well, I don't know
if that's what this is,

18:15.495 --> 18:18.296
but someone deposited $50,000

18:18.298 --> 18:20.398
into your bank account
40 minutes ago.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.101
What? That's impossible.
That's what it says.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.605
Um, I have to put in

18:27.607 --> 18:30.174
my passcode-- can you...
Yeah, yeah.
Pardon me.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.312
You done?
Yeah.

18:36.182 --> 18:37.415
Whoa.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.250
This isn't mine.

18:39.252 --> 18:42.753
I mean, I swear to God, I-I have
no idea how this happened.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.155
You have to believe me.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.257
There's no way
I would ever do anything...

18:46.259 --> 18:48.292
All right,
just relax.
But-but-but-but...

18:48.294 --> 18:50.495
I-I know how this looks, okay?
Beale. Relax.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.814
You-You... Someone's
trying to frame me.

18:52.815 --> 18:55.132
I-I am a lot of things,
Nell, but I am not a mole, okay?
Beale.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.335
Aah!
I'm sorry.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.203
No, I needed that.
Yes, you did.

18:59.205 --> 19:02.206
You need to figure out
where this money came from.

19:02.208 --> 19:03.875
And you need to keep this
between us until I do.

19:03.877 --> 19:06.244
The longer you keep this a
secret, the more suspicious

19:06.246 --> 19:08.746
you're gonna look, and I
am not gonna lie for you.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.381
Just let me figure it out, okay?

19:10.383 --> 19:12.450
Fine.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.893
You figure it out.

19:29.202 --> 19:30.668
She's lucky
you found her when you did.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.937
Let me guess,
it's the same thing

19:32.938 --> 19:35.205
that took down Granger?
Well, we need to wait on
the tox screen, but if they work

19:35.208 --> 19:36.641
together, then yeah,
there's a good chance they were

19:36.643 --> 19:38.242
similarly exposed.

19:38.244 --> 19:39.443
What's his prognosis?

19:39.445 --> 19:40.962
We're doing all we can, but

19:40.963 --> 19:42.480
he may have been fighting
this off for some time.

19:42.482 --> 19:43.915
Why he didn't seek

19:43.916 --> 19:45.349
seek medical treatment
sooner is beyond me.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.952
Well, that's because he's
a tough son of a bitch.

19:47.954 --> 19:50.721
For his sake,
I hope so.

19:50.723 --> 19:53.224
We should have
seen this coming, G.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.625
He hasn't quite
been himself lately.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.394
We both think
he looks like hell.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.728
I just thought
it was stress.

19:57.730 --> 20:00.598
SAM:
Anything else we can do?

20:00.600 --> 20:03.401
Yeah, find out where this poison

20:03.403 --> 20:05.803
is coming from before
people start dying.

20:11.211 --> 20:13.511
(sighs):
Oh, boy.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.315
NELL:<i> Have you ever</i>
<i> committed treason?</i>

20:19.852 --> 20:23.688
I supposes that depends
on one's definition.

20:24.857 --> 20:27.625
Hetty, you have to answer
yes or no.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.227
Oh, yes, I know.

20:29.229 --> 20:32.496
I'm very familiar
with this process, Ms. Jones.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.501
Hell, I developed
most of these questions.

20:39.672 --> 20:43.341
Yes, I committed treason.

20:43.343 --> 20:46.510
But never against
the United States.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.414
I'll have to make that one

20:50.416 --> 20:53.351
more specific in the future.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.987
Have you ever tried
to injure or harm

20:55.989 --> 20:58.556
assistant director
Owen Granger?

20:58.558 --> 21:00.825
Yes.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.827
I'm sorry.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.429
I said, "Have you ever tried
to injure...?"

21:05.431 --> 21:06.497
Yes, I heard you.

21:06.499 --> 21:10.468
I even tried to kill him.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.405
But that was a long time ago,

21:14.407 --> 21:16.607
and we get along

21:16.609 --> 21:19.410
much better now.

21:20.380 --> 21:23.047
Well, that's good.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.851
These the only profiles
you've cleared so far?

21:26.853 --> 21:29.720
ERIC: No, those are the only
ones with any suspicious

21:29.722 --> 21:30.955
anomalies.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.757
Whoa. You got a
suspicious anomaly?

21:32.759 --> 21:34.392
Is it above or below the waist?

21:34.394 --> 21:36.411
It's not funny.

21:36.412 --> 21:38.429
Somebody wired $50,000
into my bank account today.

21:38.431 --> 21:41.465
That's not funny.
That's frickin' awesome.
Do you have any idea where

21:41.467 --> 21:42.967
it came from?
Well, whoever
did it moved it

21:42.969 --> 21:44.969
through a bunch of different
accounts here and abroad.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.371
They clearly didn't want
me to find out who it was.

21:47.373 --> 21:49.407
I have a question.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.075
How come this stuff
never happens to me?

21:51.077 --> 21:52.927
What, blackmail?
Yeah.

21:52.928 --> 21:54.778
Do you think they transferred
the money to arouse suspicion?

21:54.781 --> 21:55.946
I don't know.

21:55.948 --> 21:57.698
Seems pretty coincidental,
don't you think?

21:57.699 --> 21:59.449
Yeah, but they also have to know
we're never gonna suspect you

21:59.452 --> 22:01.018
of being a part
of something like this.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.521
Yes, but they'd know we'd have
to check it out nonetheless,

22:03.523 --> 22:05.623
and they'd also know
he would be kept busy

22:05.625 --> 22:06.791
trying to find the source.

22:06.793 --> 22:09.493
It's a stall tactic.

22:09.495 --> 22:10.961
So, they're just
buying themselves some time.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.396
ERIC:
Yeah. Time for what?

22:12.398 --> 22:14.465
WOMAN (screaming): No! No!
What the...?

22:14.467 --> 22:17.034
WOMAN:
Need help down here!

22:17.036 --> 22:18.569
MAN:
What's going on?

22:18.571 --> 22:20.705
WOMAN:
Hurry!

22:22.475 --> 22:24.442
Helen! Helen!

22:24.444 --> 22:25.910
Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh!

22:25.912 --> 22:27.978
Got it, got it. Go. Now.

22:27.980 --> 22:30.081
Damn it! Get her down.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.082
We need a medic!

22:31.084 --> 22:32.717
She's not breathing.

22:32.719 --> 22:33.751
I'll get the defibrillator.

22:33.753 --> 22:34.985
Go, Kensi, go.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.354
(quietly):
One, two, three, four,

22:36.356 --> 22:39.390
five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten...

22:39.392 --> 22:41.359
Damn it! Kens!

22:41.361 --> 22:42.426
(continues counting quietly)

22:53.906 --> 22:55.973
It was Helen Trapper.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.875
Oh, no. From Human Resources?

22:57.877 --> 22:59.543
Yeah, that's her.

22:59.545 --> 23:00.711
She's a nice lady.

23:00.713 --> 23:01.979
There's no way
she could have been involved.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.715
You sure it
was a suicide?

23:04.716 --> 23:07.450
Kensi and Deeks are still
working the crime scene, so...

23:07.453 --> 23:10.388
I can't believe
I just said that.

23:10.390 --> 23:12.390
You know, I used to think

23:12.392 --> 23:14.392
this was the safest place
on Earth,

23:14.394 --> 23:18.129
but then, Draeger showed up,
and now this. I...

23:18.131 --> 23:19.463
There's a good chance
they're connected.

23:19.465 --> 23:20.631
Did she leave a note?

23:20.633 --> 23:21.799
Not that we found.

23:21.801 --> 23:22.967
You check
her devices?

23:22.969 --> 23:24.218
Nothing on her cell.

23:24.219 --> 23:25.468
We're still
checking her computer.

23:25.471 --> 23:26.871
What about
our surveillance cameras?

23:26.873 --> 23:28.739
The thing about that is,

23:28.741 --> 23:30.474
their layout is based
on normal operations,

23:30.476 --> 23:33.010
so, when we went into lockdown,

23:33.012 --> 23:35.413
there were some blind spots
behind the security cameras,

23:35.415 --> 23:37.415
and there's nothing
I can do about that.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.150
Perfect.
All right, we'll check
out her residence.

23:39.152 --> 23:42.052
Anything suspicious comes
up on your end, let us know.

23:42.054 --> 23:44.121
Will do. Thanks.

23:46.859 --> 23:49.193
MAN:
Right this way.

23:49.195 --> 23:50.861
Come on.

24:05.845 --> 24:08.846
MAN (on monitor): All right,
take a seat, if you like...

24:08.848 --> 24:10.781
MAN 2: This is ridiculous.
MAN: Relax.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.083
(conversation continues
indistinctly over monitor)

24:14.020 --> 24:16.887
Callen and Sam are on
their way to Helen's house.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.989
Let me know
if they find anything.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.528
Hetty, what makes you think
they're going to find anything?

24:24.530 --> 24:27.798
I mean, you and I
both knew Helen.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.800
Did we?

24:29.802 --> 24:31.969
Yes.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.605
She helped me with my paperwork
when I first started,

24:34.607 --> 24:37.174
and she had been here longer
than Callen.

24:37.176 --> 24:40.945
The best spies are the those
you least suspect.

24:40.947 --> 24:43.814
No, I know,
and I get that, but Helen?

24:43.816 --> 24:46.250
And now, we're rounding up
people from accounting

24:46.252 --> 24:48.052
and the mail room, even Beale.

24:48.054 --> 24:50.087
I don't know.

24:50.089 --> 24:54.558
I like to think
I'm a good judge of character,

24:54.560 --> 24:56.827
but I've been fooled before.

24:58.798 --> 25:01.098
People change.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.601
They lose their way.

25:03.603 --> 25:06.504
Sometimes, they lose themselves.

25:26.125 --> 25:28.592
DEEKS:
Kensi?

25:28.594 --> 25:30.761
Yeah.

25:30.763 --> 25:32.296
So, historically,

25:32.298 --> 25:35.032
poison has been a woman's
weapon of choice, am I right?

25:35.034 --> 25:36.534
I suppose.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.269
So, we are to assume

25:38.270 --> 25:40.003
that Helen killed herself
because she poisoned Granger,

25:40.006 --> 25:42.039
and knew we were
closing in on her?

25:42.041 --> 25:43.807
Right.
So, then,
why hang herself?

25:43.809 --> 25:45.960
Why not just slug back

25:45.961 --> 25:48.112
a whole smoothie of wolfsbane
and be done with it?

25:48.114 --> 25:50.948
Maybe she used it all
on Granger.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.783
Maybe.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.552
Gentlemen, you give us
a second?

25:54.554 --> 25:56.120
Mm-hmm.

25:56.122 --> 25:57.688
Then maybe
she's innocent.

25:57.690 --> 26:00.057
Maybe she had nothing
to do with Granger.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.092
And maybe the real
culprit panicked

26:02.094 --> 26:04.028
when Hetty put the
whole place on lockdown.

26:04.030 --> 26:07.031
Using her murder
as a smokescreen.

26:07.033 --> 26:09.300
You got to see this.

26:09.302 --> 26:11.569
See that? Ligature
bruising from the hanging?

26:11.571 --> 26:13.170
Yeah.
But then, look at that.

26:13.172 --> 26:17.007
There's a whole
'nother ligature wound.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.143
It's lighter and hard to see,
but it's definitely there.

26:19.145 --> 26:21.245
No, I see it.
Which means...

26:22.081 --> 26:25.115
She was strangled
before she was hung.

26:25.117 --> 26:28.118
Exactly. Poor Helen.

26:28.120 --> 26:31.155
So, now, the killer wants
to get us off his trail,

26:31.157 --> 26:32.990
so, he finds a patsy.

26:32.992 --> 26:36.994
Well, he or she, 'cause
the killer could be a she.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.796
Um, a woman could
have killed Helen

26:38.798 --> 26:40.364
and put the cord
around her neck,

26:40.366 --> 26:42.900
but there's no way she would
have been strong enough

26:42.902 --> 26:44.768
to haul her body
up in the air.

26:44.770 --> 26:47.188
I mean, it's dead weight.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.607
Okay, he. So, he needs to find
somebody sweet and unsuspecting.

26:49.609 --> 26:51.809
He sees Helen, and he says,
"Hey, Helen, listen,

26:51.811 --> 26:54.178
I just wanted
to talk to you for a second."

26:54.180 --> 26:56.647
Yes, of course, sir.
(Deeks stammers)

26:56.649 --> 26:58.182
So, she cruises in,
he looks around,

26:58.184 --> 27:00.284
tells her how much
he likes her pant suit,

27:00.286 --> 27:02.786
and pulls her in tight
like that, and he's smelling.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.054
(sniffing)
Smelling her hair.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.089
What?

27:05.091 --> 27:08.158
What?
He's smelling her hair?

27:08.160 --> 27:10.761
Oh, I was just getting into
the mindset of the killer.

27:10.763 --> 27:12.196
He smells her hair.
It smells like...

27:12.198 --> 27:13.831
Don't...
(sniffing)
It smells like lavender.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.933
Don't do that. You're freaking
me out, Hannibal Lecter.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.151
Well, now you made me
lose my train of thought.

27:17.152 --> 27:18.368
<i>You</i> made you lose
your train of thought.

27:18.371 --> 27:19.970
So, she's not a
fighter, but, obviously,

27:19.972 --> 27:21.238
animal instinct kicks in,
so, she's probably clawing

27:21.240 --> 27:22.773
at his hands like that.

27:22.775 --> 27:24.108
Right. Yeah, he's too smart.
He's a pro.

27:24.110 --> 27:26.310
He'd be wearing gloves.
But he's also desperate.

27:28.280 --> 27:32.249
If she connected, his DNA
would be under her nails.

27:32.251 --> 27:33.917
Oh, except for, we
don't have DNA samples

27:33.919 --> 27:35.753
of anybody here
who's not an agent.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.021
No, but we can get a rapid test

27:37.023 --> 27:38.222
on everybody else
left in the building

27:38.224 --> 27:39.757
and get results
in a few hours.

27:39.759 --> 27:41.158
We're gonna catch this guy.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.160
We're gonna get this guy.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.361
Oh, and one more thing.

27:44.363 --> 27:47.031
Don't... don't ever
smell me again.

27:47.033 --> 27:49.099
No promises.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.008
Find anything?

27:58.010 --> 28:00.844
Nah, man. This place kind of
reminds me of my Aunt Beezie's,

28:00.846 --> 28:03.213
if there was a couple of
dozen cats running around.

28:03.215 --> 28:06.083
Wait a second.
After all these years, you can

28:06.085 --> 28:07.435
still surprise me.

28:07.436 --> 28:08.786
You had a crazy cat lady
in the family?

28:08.788 --> 28:11.689
She's not crazy.
She's a little eccentric.

28:11.691 --> 28:13.457
Uh-huh. Six cats is eccentric.

28:13.459 --> 28:16.326
Anything over ten--
that's, uh, certifiable.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.195
She's lonely.
Uh-huh.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.830
Wonder why.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.834
Yo. Check this out.

28:40.086 --> 28:42.753
Maybe Helen had
a green thumb after all.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.825
Why are they keeping us
here like caged animals?

28:47.827 --> 28:50.394
I think it's for
our own safety.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.429
They think one of us
killed Helen.

28:52.431 --> 28:55.365
I thought
Helen killed herself.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.468
Helen? She used
to catch spiders

28:57.470 --> 29:00.404
in the kitchen
and let them go outside.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.806
She wouldn't hurt a fly.

29:02.808 --> 29:05.109
Did any of you know her well?

29:05.111 --> 29:08.212
I did. She was really nice.

29:08.214 --> 29:11.882
She used to bake things and
bring them into us all the time.

29:11.884 --> 29:13.884
I can't believe she's gone.

29:13.886 --> 29:15.352
Does she have a boyfriend?

29:16.989 --> 29:18.956
Why are you even
here, Beale?

29:18.958 --> 29:21.458
What did you do to get booted
from your ivory tower?

29:21.460 --> 29:22.826
Nothing.

29:22.828 --> 29:26.063
He's probably a plant...
here to spy on us.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.264
No, I'm not.

29:30.369 --> 29:31.535
It's about time.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.003
Are we free to go?

29:33.005 --> 29:34.404
Not yet. We gotta get
some DNA samples first,

29:34.406 --> 29:35.472
from each of you.

29:35.474 --> 29:37.040
Oh, come on.

29:37.042 --> 29:38.842
Let's just
get it over with,

29:38.844 --> 29:40.944
unless you have
something to hide.

29:40.946 --> 29:43.547
It's the principle.

29:43.549 --> 29:45.816
Open wide.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.189
You're up, man.

29:52.191 --> 29:54.825
I'm doing so
under protest.

29:59.899 --> 30:02.499
Oops. Sorry.

30:02.501 --> 30:03.934
That's quite all right.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.235
We have another one.

30:08.541 --> 30:11.074
All right, I'm doing it,
I'm doing it.

30:12.845 --> 30:14.878
Geez.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.181
(scoffs)

30:18.951 --> 30:20.951
Happy?

30:20.953 --> 30:22.386
Very.

30:22.388 --> 30:23.954
Wasn't so hard, was it?

30:23.956 --> 30:26.023
Beale, you're up.
(sighs)

30:27.960 --> 30:29.893
(groans)
Drop your weapons,
or I push this,

30:29.895 --> 30:31.595
and he's dead before
he hits the ground.

30:31.597 --> 30:33.096
Don't do this.
NELL:
Oh, my God, Eric.

30:33.098 --> 30:35.232
MAN:
You heard me.
Wait.

30:35.234 --> 30:38.936
You're much more useful
to Mr. Beale in here.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.304
But, Hetty, this...
Alert

30:40.306 --> 30:43.407
Callen and Sam. Let them know
we found our mole.

30:45.911 --> 30:47.845
We should probably
talk about this.

30:47.847 --> 30:49.613
KENSI:
Okay, okay, okay.

30:49.615 --> 30:50.981
We'll put it down.

30:50.983 --> 30:53.050
(grunts quietly)

30:53.052 --> 30:55.185
Putting it down.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.555
(sighs)
Oh, Ty...

30:58.557 --> 31:00.490
Kick the guns to me.

31:06.632 --> 31:10.367
Gwenny, come here.

31:10.369 --> 31:13.503
Now!

31:15.307 --> 31:17.074
Pick 'em up.

31:25.251 --> 31:26.917
Now...

31:26.919 --> 31:29.086
we are going to move

31:29.088 --> 31:30.554
slowly...

31:30.556 --> 31:33.290
and calmly out of here.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.093
Back it up.

31:36.095 --> 31:37.594
Back...

31:37.596 --> 31:40.530
Back it up.

31:42.201 --> 31:44.268
That's good.

31:45.471 --> 31:47.337
Close it, Beale.

31:47.339 --> 31:49.239
I don't know the code.

31:52.511 --> 31:54.077
Close it.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.946
(moaning)

31:55.948 --> 31:57.314
(keypad beeping)

31:57.316 --> 31:59.650
(Gwenn gasps,
shouts, anxiously)

32:06.025 --> 32:08.292
Son of a bitch.

32:08.294 --> 32:11.995
Do not let them out
of your sight.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.182
Damn it. It's fried.
We gotta get out of here.

32:32.184 --> 32:33.517
Nell, you got
eyes on them?

32:33.519 --> 32:35.018
No, but I can hear them.
DEEKS:
Where are they?

32:35.020 --> 32:37.955
I don't know.
Eric, if you can hear me,

32:37.957 --> 32:39.623
give us a clue
as to where you are.

32:39.625 --> 32:42.626
BROWN: Stop right there. Now.
Lift up your shirt.
Eric...

32:42.628 --> 32:44.261
ERIC:
What?!

32:45.064 --> 32:46.463
Do it.

32:48.734 --> 32:50.534
Where is it?

32:52.738 --> 32:54.471
Ah.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.473
I should have known.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.442
Give it to me.

32:58.444 --> 33:01.278
Okay.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.113
But we have to keep moving.
The best bet...

33:03.115 --> 33:05.115
Oh, shoot.

33:05.117 --> 33:07.117
MAN:
Nell?
Eric?

33:07.119 --> 33:08.635
Callen.

33:08.636 --> 33:10.152
I need you to take the
carport door off lockdown

33:10.155 --> 33:11.421
so we can get in.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.090
Okay. Well, please hurry up.
Brown is trying

33:13.092 --> 33:15.258
to get Eric out of the building
as his hostage.

33:15.260 --> 33:16.593
We'll be there in six minutes.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.528
Four.
Five.

33:18.530 --> 33:19.913
Err on the side of caution.

33:19.914 --> 33:21.297
Have I ever crashed
with you in the car?

33:21.300 --> 33:23.133
Yeah. A lot of times.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.668
Well,
those were all intentional.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.670
Lucky me.

33:35.614 --> 33:39.049
Ty.
Stay put.

33:49.561 --> 33:52.195
How do we get out of here?
Look,

33:52.197 --> 33:53.563
Carl, just put the gun...

33:53.565 --> 33:55.265
(grunts)

33:56.568 --> 33:58.201
Get me out of here

33:58.203 --> 33:59.803
or I'll kill you.

33:59.805 --> 34:01.805
(phone ringing)

34:01.807 --> 34:04.274
Give it to me.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.614
Mr. Beale can't come
to the phone right now

34:10.616 --> 34:12.282
because he's about to die

34:12.284 --> 34:15.052
if you don't back the hell off.

34:15.054 --> 34:19.222
How do we know
he isn't already dead?

34:19.224 --> 34:20.357
(sighs)

34:20.359 --> 34:22.225
I'm fine.
Just do as he says.

34:22.227 --> 34:24.428
I don't want to die
in this old building.

34:25.631 --> 34:28.365
Old building.
(gasps)

34:28.367 --> 34:31.501
He's taking him through
the burn room service area.

34:31.503 --> 34:34.137
Smart boy.
Callen,

34:34.139 --> 34:37.074
Eric is leading him down
into the basement storage area.

34:40.145 --> 34:43.346
What the hell are you playing?

34:43.348 --> 34:46.683
You want a way out of
here-- this is it.

34:53.759 --> 34:57.260
This leads
to the basement storage area.

34:58.130 --> 35:00.797
It's outside
the containment zone.

35:00.799 --> 35:03.133
You can exit to the street
from there.

35:11.376 --> 35:14.578
You may just live
through this after all, Beale.

35:14.580 --> 35:17.247
But I doubt it.

35:17.249 --> 35:19.316
Go.

35:22.387 --> 35:24.187
Which way?

35:24.189 --> 35:26.256
I don't know. I've only
ever seen the blueprints.

35:26.258 --> 35:28.391
You lying little geek.

35:28.393 --> 35:30.127
No, they-they changed
everything around

35:30.129 --> 35:31.661
when they put the
new furnaces in.

35:31.663 --> 35:34.164
All right.

35:34.166 --> 35:37.167
You've actually been
really helpful, Beale.

35:38.303 --> 35:41.371
I almost hate to kill you.

35:44.309 --> 35:45.275
(gasps)

35:45.277 --> 35:46.343
(clattering)

35:51.750 --> 35:53.884
(gasping softly)

35:56.655 --> 35:58.688
Beale?

35:58.690 --> 36:00.690
Come out here right now,

36:00.692 --> 36:03.293
or I will shoot you like a dog.

36:03.295 --> 36:05.195
Beale!

36:05.197 --> 36:07.664
Pick on someone your own size.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.207
KENSI:
Hello, Carl.

36:17.209 --> 36:18.375
Holla.

36:20.712 --> 36:21.912
I'll take those.

36:23.949 --> 36:26.216
KENSI:
Remember us?

36:32.224 --> 36:34.357
Is it just me or does
he seem awfully happy

36:34.359 --> 36:35.525
for a guy who's
going to jail

36:35.527 --> 36:38.228
for the rest
of his life?

36:38.230 --> 36:39.696
Maybe he just likes bunk beds.

36:52.277 --> 36:53.944
So here's what we know.

36:53.946 --> 36:56.813
You befriended Helen,
maybe even led her to believe

36:56.815 --> 36:58.815
that you might be interested
in her romantically.

36:58.817 --> 37:00.850
Convinced her to let you
use her garage,

37:00.852 --> 37:02.586
do a little gardening...

37:02.587 --> 37:04.321
And when she started
to realize what was going on,

37:04.323 --> 37:06.256
you asked to speak with her
privately.

37:06.258 --> 37:08.258
You killed her, Carl,

37:08.260 --> 37:10.927
making it look
like a suicide.

37:10.929 --> 37:12.796
Almost.

37:12.798 --> 37:14.931
She never suspected anything.

37:14.933 --> 37:19.336
Desperate people will believe
anything you want them to.

37:19.338 --> 37:23.873
Now, I would like a place
on the beach.

37:23.875 --> 37:27.811
A condo overlooking Venice
or the marina would be good.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.246
CALLEN:
I-I'm sorry. Did I...

37:29.248 --> 37:31.115
pass out and miss something?

37:31.116 --> 37:32.983
I think we all know
you're here to offer me a deal.

37:32.985 --> 37:34.317
You'll be lucky
if we offer you a blindfold

37:34.319 --> 37:35.819
for the firing squad.

37:35.821 --> 37:37.821
Ooh.

37:37.823 --> 37:40.690
G... Can I call you G?

37:40.692 --> 37:41.858
No.

37:41.860 --> 37:44.327
I'm more valuable to you
as an asset

37:44.329 --> 37:45.829
than an embarrassment.

37:45.831 --> 37:48.632
The only one you're embarrassing
is yourself.

37:48.634 --> 37:51.434
(chuckling): I think we all know
that's not true.

37:51.436 --> 37:53.470
I've already proven
my abilities.

37:53.472 --> 37:55.939
Quite impressively, I might add.

37:55.941 --> 37:59.342
But...
you caught me.

37:59.344 --> 38:02.379
Now, I have no desire
to go to jail

38:02.381 --> 38:04.381
and you have no desire
for me to go to trial,

38:04.383 --> 38:06.283
because if I did,

38:06.285 --> 38:07.584
well, let's face it,

38:07.586 --> 38:09.586
once the story
of my infiltration

38:09.588 --> 38:12.922
of your organization
becomes public knowledge,

38:12.924 --> 38:15.392
it'll be the end
of your careers

38:15.394 --> 38:16.993
and everyone else in this unit,

38:16.995 --> 38:20.430
including Hetty and Granger.

38:20.432 --> 38:21.998
What are you proposing?

38:22.000 --> 38:25.835
I believe it's called
the dangled mole scenario.

38:25.837 --> 38:28.571
I'm gonna work for you
as a double agent.

38:28.573 --> 38:31.608
Hell, I've already created
the perfect legend.

38:31.610 --> 38:33.610
And what makes you think
we would ever want

38:33.612 --> 38:35.745
someone like you working
with us?

38:35.747 --> 38:37.681
Well, because if I don't,
then you'll never have access

38:37.683 --> 38:39.349
to what I know,

38:39.351 --> 38:41.451
who I work for,

38:41.453 --> 38:44.321
anything.

38:44.323 --> 38:47.057
Of course, I'll need my lawyer
to negotiate the deal.

38:47.059 --> 38:50.527
I leave these type things
up to the professionals.

38:50.529 --> 38:52.595
He's right.

38:53.899 --> 38:55.732
Yeah.
We have to leave this

38:55.734 --> 38:57.734
to the professionals.

38:57.736 --> 38:59.803
(speaks Polish)

39:03.508 --> 39:05.108
What is this?

39:05.110 --> 39:07.110
(speaks Polish)

39:08.747 --> 39:10.914
I want my lawyer.
(chuckles)

39:10.916 --> 39:12.115
Don't ask us-- ask them.

39:12.117 --> 39:13.450
You're in their custody now.

39:13.452 --> 39:15.352
Who are you?
Who are they?

39:15.354 --> 39:17.520
They're the ones who will
find out what you actually know.

39:17.522 --> 39:19.122
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where am I going?

39:19.124 --> 39:20.123
Where are they taking me?

39:20.125 --> 39:21.791
We don't know. No one does.

39:21.793 --> 39:23.593
That's why they call it
a black site.

39:23.595 --> 39:24.594
BROWN:
Extraordinary rendition

39:24.596 --> 39:26.029
is against the law.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.431
So is treason.

39:29.801 --> 39:31.501
(speaks Polish)

39:42.080 --> 39:45.548
Are you guys really gonna
send him to a black site?

39:45.550 --> 39:47.517
SAM: He's headed
to an animal shelter

39:47.519 --> 39:49.119
in Barstow.
When they hear
the dogs barking

39:49.121 --> 39:51.721
after a few hours in the car,
with a bag over their head,

39:51.723 --> 39:53.723
you'd be amazed how
willing they are to talk.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.658
Yeah, but like he said,
you know, desperate people

39:55.660 --> 39:57.660
are willing to do
whatever you want 'em to.
Mm-hmm.

39:57.662 --> 39:58.862
Nice.

39:58.864 --> 40:00.130
Hey.

40:00.132 --> 40:01.931
Good job today.

40:01.933 --> 40:05.168
Thanks, lady.
So, are you guys okay?

40:05.170 --> 40:07.137
I'm okay. G?
Solid.

40:07.138 --> 40:09.105
I got a little kink in my neck
from the crawl space.

40:09.107 --> 40:10.473
Maybe you can just give
me a quick massage.
Oh, yeah?

40:10.475 --> 40:11.875
No. We're fine.

40:11.877 --> 40:13.176
We're actually
just fine.

40:13.178 --> 40:15.178
You might want to...
check on Eric, though.

40:15.180 --> 40:17.013
Yeah.

40:17.015 --> 40:19.416
Hey. You all right?

40:19.418 --> 40:21.451
Yeah. I can't smell.

40:21.453 --> 40:23.686
Yeah.
He broke my glasses.

40:23.688 --> 40:25.755
I see that.

40:26.691 --> 40:29.159
Guess what.

40:29.161 --> 40:31.127
You look better
without 'em.

40:31.129 --> 40:34.464
Okay. I think
that's our cue, huh?

40:35.434 --> 40:36.833
Wow, this is happening.

40:36.835 --> 40:39.169
What's this?
(hisses)

40:39.171 --> 40:41.137
Old building.

40:41.139 --> 40:44.207
Old building.

40:45.510 --> 40:47.577
(monitor beeping steadily)

40:48.513 --> 40:50.580
Mm.

41:03.061 --> 41:06.596
Clearly I haven't died
and gone to Heaven.

41:06.598 --> 41:08.598
(chuckles)

41:08.600 --> 41:10.166
I don't think
that's in the cards

41:10.168 --> 41:12.936
for either one of us, Owen.

41:13.872 --> 41:16.239
What the hell happened?

41:17.209 --> 41:19.876
Well, let's see.

41:19.878 --> 41:23.012
Um, you were poisoned

41:23.014 --> 41:25.715
and crashed your car.

41:25.717 --> 41:30.186
And then, while
you were napping,

41:30.188 --> 41:31.654
the rest of us

41:31.656 --> 41:34.057
smoked out our mole.

41:34.059 --> 41:36.926
Brown, from the
I.T. department.

41:36.928 --> 41:38.995
Oh...

41:41.099 --> 41:43.032
World seemed a lot safer

41:43.034 --> 41:45.902
before we had these cyber punks
running around.

41:45.904 --> 41:47.971
Indeed.

41:49.808 --> 41:51.875
Who was
he working for?

41:54.246 --> 41:57.113
We don't know yet.

41:57.115 --> 42:00.650
We'll figure it out in due time.

42:00.652 --> 42:04.921
All you have to worry about now
is getting better.

42:04.923 --> 42:06.789
You're safe.

42:11.229 --> 42:14.964
Don't tell me
you're here to watch over me.

42:16.768 --> 42:19.836
Something like that.

42:21.740 --> 42:24.874
You need to go to sleep.

42:31.750 --> 42:36.653
