means we help determine

right?

to Mr. Stillman was tragic,

drug induced?

02:35.475 --> 02:37.309
was an expose on
an inner city drug ring,

09:04.967 --> 09:06.044
but nobody saw anything.

09:06.068 --> 09:07.553
It's locked up now.
Detectives are heading over.

09:07.554 --> 09:08.970
All right,
we need that address.

09:13.510 --> 09:15.644
No forced entry.

09:15.646 --> 09:18.430
Dr. Suri
let his attacker in.

09:18.432 --> 09:21.433
This wasn't an assault,
it was an abduction.

09:21.435 --> 09:23.435
What do we know
about this guy?

09:23.437 --> 09:26.738
Well, according to his assistant,
he was published but controversial.

09:26.740 --> 09:30.275
Controversial.
We're talking about bugs, right?

09:30.277 --> 09:31.493
He had extreme theories

09:31.495 --> 09:35.614
on the impact humans have
on insect mating habits.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.370
This is probably
the doctor's cell phone.

09:42.372 --> 09:45.540
Whoever did this made sure
to leave it behind.

09:45.542 --> 09:47.375
Didn't want us tracing him
through GPS

09:47.377 --> 09:49.010
because of the unsub's
organization.

09:49.012 --> 09:52.380
It also means this isn't
an equivocal death investigation anymore.

09:52.382 --> 09:54.466
[Cell phone beeping]
This is serial.

09:55.686 --> 09:59.821
Spence. The M.E. has something
we need to see right away.

10:07.648 --> 10:11.650
[Gasping]

10:13.787 --> 10:17.038
[Moaning]

10:27.301 --> 10:28.466
You.

10:28.468 --> 10:31.720
What are you doing
to me?

10:31.722 --> 10:33.004
What do you want?

10:33.006 --> 10:35.824
You said you wanted proof.

10:35.826 --> 10:37.192
So you attack me?

10:37.194 --> 10:40.095
You bring me
to this place?!

10:40.097 --> 10:42.013
Where are we?

10:42.015 --> 10:43.848
Do you see it?

10:43.850 --> 10:45.900
Please tell me
that is not my blood.

10:45.902 --> 10:47.185
No. No, it's mine.

10:47.187 --> 10:49.854
don't you see anything
strange about it?

10:49.856 --> 10:51.389
I--I need to look at it
under a slide, run some tests--

10:51.389 --> 10:52.470
What are you talking about?

10:52.494 --> 10:54.494
It's right there in
front of you. It's black!

10:54.695 --> 10:58.163
No, it's not.
What are you talking about?

11:02.536 --> 11:05.704
Ah! You've corrupted
the sample.

11:06.873 --> 11:08.873
How could I have
corrupted the sample?!

11:08.875 --> 11:11.376
Look at me!
Look what you're doing to me!

11:11.378 --> 11:13.211
I'm tied to a chair!

11:19.052 --> 11:22.771
Now, I--I have
listened to you.

11:22.773 --> 11:26.107
I have entertained
all of your theories.

11:26.109 --> 11:29.644
But what you have
described to me...

11:29.646 --> 11:31.863
It is not possible.

11:33.283 --> 11:34.783
It might be real to you,

11:34.785 --> 11:36.901
but that is...

11:36.903 --> 11:41.072
that is because
you are sick.

11:42.125 --> 11:44.642
Yeah.

11:44.644 --> 11:46.544
You're right.

11:48.215 --> 11:52.801
Let me show you what it feels like
to be sick like I am!

11:54.254 --> 11:56.137
No!

11:57.758 --> 12:00.475
Duct tape residue
was found on his wrist,

12:00.477 --> 12:02.427
ankles, and neck.

12:02.429 --> 12:04.429
So he was held
against his will?

12:04.431 --> 12:05.897
Yeah.

12:05.899 --> 12:07.849
It's the rest of it
I can't explain.

12:07.851 --> 12:11.236
The victim's own skin
was found under his fingernails.

12:11.238 --> 12:14.072
The fingernails were in turn
gouged into different parts of his body.

12:14.074 --> 12:16.040
He broke them off
scratching himself?

12:16.042 --> 12:18.526
Yeah. And kept scratching all the
way down to his subcutaneous layer

12:18.528 --> 12:19.861
on his index
and middle fingers.

12:19.863 --> 12:22.080
Are these track marks
consistent with heroin abuse?

12:22.082 --> 12:24.783
Oh, yeah. Tox screen
came back positive, too.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.418
When was the last time
he shot up?

12:26.420 --> 12:28.620
Based on scar tissue,
I'd say about a week ago.

12:28.622 --> 12:32.457
Ok, so he was kicking
when the unsub held him.

12:32.459 --> 12:34.209
One of the withdrawal
symptoms of that

12:34.211 --> 12:37.245
is it feels like your skin is on fire.
You can't help but scratch.

12:37.247 --> 12:38.713
Think about this for a second.

12:38.715 --> 12:40.949
Stillman was bound,
but the unsub cut him loose.

12:40.951 --> 12:42.233
He wanted him to scratch.

12:42.235 --> 12:45.186
That tells us
this isn't torture.

12:45.188 --> 12:48.106
If it were torture, he would have never
taken the duct tape off.

12:48.108 --> 12:50.809
What if it's an expression
of his own pain?

12:50.811 --> 12:53.278
Maybe the unsub wants
his victims to feel

12:53.280 --> 12:55.480
what's going on
inside of him.

12:55.482 --> 12:56.482
Which is?

12:56.483 --> 12:58.983
Welts on the skin
behind his ear.

12:58.985 --> 13:02.153
Some sort of external irritant
the unsub introduced.

13:02.155 --> 13:03.155
Saw that, too.

13:03.156 --> 13:04.539
Lab's running tests.

13:04.541 --> 13:07.492
I don't know,
a bite, maybe?

13:11.748 --> 13:13.465
Wait--wait--

13:13.467 --> 13:16.251
[gasping] Wait! Wait.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.803
What are you doing?

13:18.805 --> 13:20.839
[Breathing hard]
What are you doing, please?!

13:20.841 --> 13:23.725
Oh! Oh!

13:23.727 --> 13:25.176
No, no, no!

13:25.178 --> 13:27.061
No, no, please don't--
please don't do this!

13:27.063 --> 13:29.681
No, you're right!
I hear you, I hear you.

13:29.683 --> 13:32.183
Please. Please.
don't do this!

13:32.185 --> 13:33.985
I beg you, please
don't do this!

13:33.987 --> 13:37.071
Please think about this.
You're right! Please stop it!

13:37.073 --> 13:39.274
don't, don't, please!
don't do this to me.

13:39.276 --> 13:40.909
We can talk about this.

13:40.911 --> 13:43.661
I want to talk about this.
Please, please, don't do it!

13:43.663 --> 13:45.947
No! Oh, no!
No, stop it!

13:45.949 --> 13:46.915
Oh, no, please!

13:46.917 --> 13:48.700
No more, please!
Please stop it!

13:48.702 --> 13:52.203
No, no! You're right!
No, stop it!

13:52.205 --> 13:53.205
Oh, my god! No!

13:53.206 --> 13:57.292
No! Please stop it!
Please stop it!

13:57.294 --> 13:59.294
Oh, stop it!
I can't breathe!

13:59.296 --> 14:00.296
I can't breathe!

14:00.297 --> 14:02.463
Oh, please! Stop it!

14:02.465 --> 14:04.966
Aah! Aah!

14:11.516 --> 14:13.732
Rossi:
So, we found William Suri.

14:14.131 --> 14:16.451
Kate: Yeah. Garbage truck
almost ran over him this morning.

14:16.539 --> 14:18.873
Our unsub didn't
hold him as long.

14:18.875 --> 14:21.375
Then he shot him
pointblank in the head.

14:21.377 --> 14:22.676
Big change in M.O.

14:22.678 --> 14:25.045
Not necessarily.
He shows less signs of scratching,

14:25.047 --> 14:26.881
but the bite marks
are definitely there.

14:26.883 --> 14:28.682
So, the unsub wants
this guy to itch,

14:28.684 --> 14:30.885
the good Doctor
doesn't play along,

14:30.887 --> 14:33.387
bang, he ends
the torture early.

14:33.389 --> 14:35.055
I don't think this is torture
for the unsub.

14:35.057 --> 14:36.273
I think it's a delusion.

14:36.275 --> 14:37.942
Can I have those tweezers?

14:37.944 --> 14:39.860
What kind of delusion?

14:52.191 --> 14:54.742
[Groans]

14:54.744 --> 14:56.460
Bugs.

14:56.462 --> 14:58.879
We need to deliver
the profile.

14:58.881 --> 15:00.247
We believe the unsub
we're looking for

15:00.249 --> 15:02.333
suffers from delusional
parasitosis,

15:02.335 --> 15:03.801
a condition in which
the patient believes

15:03.803 --> 15:06.220
that he's being attacked
or infested by bugs.

15:06.222 --> 15:08.923
He takes his victims and
covers them in insects,

15:08.925 --> 15:10.079
cockroaches specifically.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.720
We think it's to convince

15:11.744 --> 15:13.685
his victims that they
share in his condition.

15:13.930 --> 15:15.846
Is he trying to get them sick
so he can kill them?

15:15.848 --> 15:17.731
Murder isn't his goal,
attention is.

15:17.733 --> 15:20.017
Believe it or not, this unsub
is crying out for help.

15:20.019 --> 15:21.986
He kidnapped
an investigative journalist

15:21.988 --> 15:23.654
because he wanted
Albert Stillman

15:23.656 --> 15:25.322
to write a story about
the bugs inside of him.

15:25.324 --> 15:27.775
Unfortunately, because Stillman was
suddenly experiencing

15:27.777 --> 15:28.859
opiate withdrawal,

15:28.861 --> 15:30.327
he was already
hallucinating insects,

15:30.329 --> 15:31.946
and this led to
a psychotic break.

15:31.948 --> 15:33.247
JJ: So the unsub
changed tactics.

15:33.249 --> 15:36.000
He kidnapped a controversial
research scientist

15:36.002 --> 15:38.169
who he thought would be
more willing to believe him.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.838
Morgan: But we think Dr. Suri
recognized his condition

15:40.840 --> 15:42.289
for the mental illness
that it is.

15:42.291 --> 15:45.292
That's why he killed him
so quickly.

15:45.294 --> 15:47.711
It is important
that we not label this unsub

15:47.713 --> 15:49.513
as crazy or insane
to the media or press.

15:49.515 --> 15:51.849
He's desperate to confirm
his own self-diagnosis

15:51.851 --> 15:53.384
and he'll be violent
towards those who don't.

15:53.386 --> 15:57.021
And this kind of delusion goes
hand in hand with conspiracy thinking.

15:57.023 --> 15:59.557
He probably believes
the bugs are part of a plot

15:59.559 --> 16:01.725
involving the government
to keep him sick.

16:01.727 --> 16:04.862
JJ: When he's alone,
he'll be paranoid and disorganized.

16:04.864 --> 16:07.982
His body will be
mutilated from self-harm.

16:07.984 --> 16:09.483
But his search
for a fellow believer

16:09.485 --> 16:12.987
will give him focus and allow him
to appear calm and rational.

16:12.989 --> 16:16.323
We should be canvassing the entomology
and infectious disease fields

16:16.325 --> 16:18.659
as well as reviewing
hospital intake records.

16:18.661 --> 16:21.078
This unsub has searched high and low
for treatment for his condition,

16:21.080 --> 16:23.664
and we believe that he'll return
to one of these locations

16:23.666 --> 16:26.333
for his next victim.
Thank you.

16:26.335 --> 16:30.037
I think that we have time
for one more share.

16:30.039 --> 16:32.606
Anybody?

16:32.608 --> 16:35.209
Go ahead, Jane.

16:35.211 --> 16:37.845
So, I went back
to the dermatologist,

16:37.847 --> 16:41.181
and she again tried to tell me
what my problem was.

16:41.183 --> 16:44.068
You know, she said
that it was maybe mold

16:44.070 --> 16:47.354
or static electricity.

16:47.356 --> 16:48.689
I mean, can you think
about that,

16:48.691 --> 16:51.075
that's what's going on
inside my body could be--

16:51.077 --> 16:52.326
[laughs]

16:52.328 --> 16:54.662
because of static
electricity? Just...

16:54.664 --> 16:56.247
[Laughs]

16:56.249 --> 16:59.033
And then she had the nerve
to try and sell me a salve.

16:59.035 --> 17:01.752
And when I looked to see
what was inside the salve,

17:01.754 --> 17:03.787
it was St. John's wort.

17:03.789 --> 17:07.374
I mean, really, do you think
I haven't' already tried St. John's wort?

17:07.376 --> 17:08.376
And I just...

17:08.377 --> 17:10.544
And I could see it

17:10.546 --> 17:13.547
really clearly now,
you know?

17:13.549 --> 17:15.348
It's not me.

17:15.351 --> 17:16.684
It's society.

17:16.685 --> 17:19.720
You know? They want me
to be sick.

17:19.722 --> 17:22.056
Because if I'm sick,
if it's me,

17:22.058 --> 17:24.223
they can keep ignoring me.

17:24.226 --> 17:27.895
But I won't be ignored anymore.

17:27.896 --> 17:29.780
Thank you for letting me share.

17:29.782 --> 17:33.400
[All clapping]

17:34.487 --> 17:37.371
Ok, why don't we stand up
and join hands

17:37.373 --> 17:42.076
and end our meeting
with our prayer.

17:42.078 --> 17:45.713
All: Lord, grant me the wisdom
to see the light...

17:45.715 --> 17:46.914
Hi. I'm Leo.

17:46.916 --> 17:49.750
The strength to believe
the truth...

17:49.752 --> 17:51.752
serenity with my body...

17:51.754 --> 17:55.839
the courage to know how to...

17:55.841 --> 17:59.259
Morgan: There's an inherent
contradiction in who this unsub is.

17:59.261 --> 18:00.594
Rossi: Only one?

18:00.596 --> 18:01.895
All right, humor me.

18:01.897 --> 18:03.814
This guy has a phobia
of insects, right?

18:03.816 --> 18:06.233
So why subject his victims
to the very thing he hates?

18:06.235 --> 18:07.518
It's not a phobia.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.486
Well, maybe not,
but the bugs disgust him.

18:09.488 --> 18:10.821
Labels
are important here.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.940
The original name for
this was entomophobia,

18:12.942 --> 18:15.359
which is, yes, the fear/ disgust
at being bitten, being stung,

18:15.361 --> 18:17.161
or the fear
of future infestation,

18:17.163 --> 18:19.163
but if you have
delusional parasitosis,

18:19.165 --> 18:20.331
you believe you're
already infested.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.749
Present tense,
not future tense.

18:21.751 --> 18:24.084
So his worst fear
has come true.

18:24.086 --> 18:26.120
What he wants now
is exposure.

18:26.122 --> 18:28.205
He believes if society and the
scientific community take him seriously,

18:28.207 --> 18:29.573
maybe he'll get relief.

18:29.575 --> 18:31.508
Yeah, but that's impossible
if it's all in his head.

18:31.510 --> 18:32.960
The more people
that tell him that,

18:32.962 --> 18:34.178
the more angry
he's gonna get.

18:34.180 --> 18:35.713
Which is why
he'll take solace in people

18:35.715 --> 18:37.181
who are as frustrated
as he is.

18:37.183 --> 18:40.134
Guys, there's a suspect pool
we've been missing all along.

18:40.136 --> 18:41.802
[Dialing, ring]

18:41.804 --> 18:42.970
I'm here for helping.

18:42.972 --> 18:44.304
Garcia, I'm going to
run through a series

18:44.306 --> 18:45.973
of debated and
controversial diseases.

18:45.975 --> 18:48.308
I want you to tell me if there Ar
 any support groups in the area.

18:48.310 --> 18:50.027
Fibromyalgia.
Hit me.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.196
No.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.731
Chronic fatigue syndrome.

18:53.733 --> 18:54.733
No.

18:54.734 --> 18:55.816
Recurrent Lyme disease.

18:55.818 --> 18:56.984
Negative.

18:56.986 --> 19:00.320
Morgellons?

19:00.322 --> 19:02.906
There's a Magellan's astronomy club
that meets on Tuesdays.

19:02.908 --> 19:04.291
No, morgellons.

19:04.293 --> 19:06.660
M-o-r-g-e-l-l-o-n-s.

19:06.662 --> 19:09.163
Huh. Those vowels
will get ya.

19:09.165 --> 19:10.130
Checking now.

19:10.132 --> 19:11.382
I'll bite.
What's morgellons?

19:11.384 --> 19:13.050
It's a syndrome where
sufferers believe they have

19:13.052 --> 19:14.468
disease-causing fibers
under their skin.

19:14.470 --> 19:16.637
They collect them only to later be told
by dermatologists

19:16.639 --> 19:19.390
that all they've found is lint, dead skin,
or their own picked scabs.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.175
Sounds like it's on
the OCD spectrum.

19:21.177 --> 19:23.010
There's a lot of overlap.
There's also patients

19:23.012 --> 19:25.312
who insist the fibers
are insect-like in nature.

19:25.314 --> 19:27.347
Yeah, update.
There's a morgellons group

19:27.349 --> 19:29.483
that gets together tonight,
actually. Just missed then,

19:29.485 --> 19:31.685
Hotch: Garcia, we need an address.
Done.

19:31.687 --> 19:34.354
JJ, you and Morgan go
and see if they'll talk to us.

19:35.191 --> 19:38.058
[Country western song plays]

19:38.060 --> 19:39.576
No, no, no, no.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.278
[Whispering]
The drinking water.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.864
Drinking wa...

19:43.866 --> 19:45.999
You think they put it
in the drinking water?

19:46.001 --> 19:48.035
Yeah, that's the easiest
way to infect us.

19:48.037 --> 19:50.304
That means everyone's sick.

19:50.306 --> 19:51.672
Everyone is sick.

19:51.674 --> 19:54.792
See, but you and I,
we react to it differently. Right?

19:54.794 --> 19:56.093
We feel it differently.

19:56.095 --> 19:58.062
That's what makes us
special.

19:59.598 --> 20:02.716
[Takes deep breath]
So...

20:02.718 --> 20:04.718
if it's this thing
that I have...

20:04.720 --> 20:05.953
We have.

20:05.955 --> 20:08.722
That we have...

20:08.724 --> 20:09.940
is real--

20:09.942 --> 20:11.191
Oh, it's very real.

20:11.193 --> 20:13.210
How do I get people
to believe us?

20:13.212 --> 20:14.561
I was getting really close,

20:14.563 --> 20:16.230
and that's when
they tried to kill me.

20:16.232 --> 20:18.282
They tried to kill you?

20:18.284 --> 20:19.284
Shh.

20:19.285 --> 20:21.034
When you worked at...

20:21.036 --> 20:23.470
Well, how do you live
with that?

20:23.472 --> 20:25.072
They could just come
and get you anytime.

20:25.074 --> 20:29.243
Actually, I'm grateful.
'Cause whatever they did to me,

20:29.245 --> 20:30.744
it turned up the volume, ok?

20:30.746 --> 20:34.064
It improved my intuition,
my instincts.

20:34.066 --> 20:38.886
When something's wrong,
it comes out more.

20:38.888 --> 20:41.305
While we've been sitting here,
it hasn't come out once.

20:41.307 --> 20:44.091
That tells me something.

20:44.093 --> 20:45.592
Yeah.

20:47.797 --> 20:49.429
I haven't felt it either.

20:49.431 --> 20:50.764
See?

20:50.766 --> 20:54.601
Maybe that's the cure.

20:54.603 --> 20:57.554
You and me.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.523
Maybe.

21:06.382 --> 21:10.184
How bad does it get
for you?

21:12.788 --> 21:15.155
Pretty bad.

21:21.547 --> 21:23.096
Do you want to see?

21:23.098 --> 21:26.450
Yeah, but...not here.

21:31.974 --> 21:34.191
Let's get out of here.

21:34.193 --> 21:36.560
Why am I not surprised
that the FBI

21:36.562 --> 21:38.445
is showing up
at my meetings?

21:38.447 --> 21:40.781
Look, we're just asking
if you can think of anyone

21:40.783 --> 21:42.065
who might fit our profile.

21:42.067 --> 21:43.283
Oh, I'll tell you
what I think.

21:43.285 --> 21:45.118
I think this is
the same tactic

21:45.120 --> 21:47.621
that the FBI pulls
over and over again.

21:47.623 --> 21:50.657
Occupy, WTO,
anti-war groups,

21:50.659 --> 21:52.409
only this time,
you people are really

21:52.411 --> 21:53.877
scraping the bottom
of the barrel.

21:53.879 --> 21:55.879
I'll bet that you even
worked out

21:55.881 --> 21:58.232
a little shakedown speech
on the way over.

21:58.234 --> 22:01.385
Hey, weirdoes, we support your right
for free assembly,

22:01.387 --> 22:04.922
but there might be a serial killer
among you, so watch your back.

22:04.924 --> 22:07.341
Right? You want us scared.

22:07.343 --> 22:08.842
You want us isolated.

22:08.844 --> 22:12.179
That way it's easier for you to tell us
morgellons is made up.

22:12.181 --> 22:15.065
Ms. Randall, we have no opinion
about your condition

22:15.067 --> 22:17.184
one way or the other.

22:17.186 --> 22:20.404
Do you see this man?

22:20.406 --> 22:24.241
His name is Albert Stillman.

22:24.243 --> 22:25.409
And this man.

22:25.411 --> 22:27.027
Dr. William Suri.

22:27.029 --> 22:28.245
Do you see him?

22:28.247 --> 22:30.530
This is not made up.
This is real.

22:30.532 --> 22:33.817
The man we're looking for thinks
he has cockroaches inside of him.

22:33.819 --> 22:36.920
He'd be quiet.
Not demonstrative.

22:36.922 --> 22:38.872
Probably not comfortable
sharing to the entire group,

22:38.874 --> 22:41.425
but very convincing
one on one.

22:42.845 --> 22:47.180
Ms. Randall, do you know
anyone like that?

22:50.269 --> 22:51.885
No.

22:51.887 --> 22:53.937
No one.

22:53.939 --> 22:56.690
What makes you think
that he would even show up here?

22:56.692 --> 22:58.475
'Cause your group would listen
to what he has to say,

22:58.477 --> 22:59.776
and you'd believe him.

22:59.778 --> 23:01.895
But that doesn't mean
we're like him.

23:01.897 --> 23:03.196
No, it doesn't.

23:03.198 --> 23:05.816
But it could mean
you're his next target.

23:10.873 --> 23:11.905
Hmm.

23:11.907 --> 23:14.908
You sure?

23:14.910 --> 23:17.828
Yeah.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.963
You ready?

23:19.965 --> 23:21.915
Ok.

23:21.917 --> 23:23.000
1...

23:23.002 --> 23:24.551
Ooh. Oh!

23:24.553 --> 23:26.920
I didn't want you
to tense up.

23:26.922 --> 23:28.221
[Laughs] No, it's ok.

23:28.223 --> 23:30.807
It's worse
when you tense up.

23:30.809 --> 23:32.643
Oh, it's perfect.

23:32.645 --> 23:35.562
Uh, can you hand me
a slide?

23:35.564 --> 23:37.397
Yeah.

23:46.608 --> 23:48.325
Ok.

23:50.612 --> 23:52.746
All right.

23:52.748 --> 23:54.931
All right, look.

23:54.933 --> 23:57.167
They should be wiggling.

23:57.169 --> 23:58.502
Can you see them?

23:58.504 --> 24:01.371
Please see them.

24:01.373 --> 24:02.956
[Exhales]
Yeah.

24:02.958 --> 24:05.375
I see them.

24:05.377 --> 24:07.294
Thank you.

24:07.296 --> 24:09.930
Are they only
in your blood?

24:13.185 --> 24:15.802
No.

24:15.804 --> 24:18.805
They're everywhere.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.614
Tell me again
that it's real.

24:31.704 --> 24:34.121
It's real.

24:37.576 --> 24:40.327
Can you heal me?

24:45.334 --> 24:48.835
Yeah. I can.

25:12.053 --> 25:14.260
Where are we on
the E.R. intake?

25:14.316 --> 25:16.499
Garcia weeded out
the mental health transfers.

25:16.501 --> 25:18.167
No one fits.

25:18.169 --> 25:19.669
Our best bet is still
the morgellons group.

25:19.671 --> 25:20.837
Next week.
When's their next meeting?

25:20.839 --> 25:21.839
It's too long to wait.

25:21.840 --> 25:23.139
We could take another
shot at the leader.

25:23.141 --> 25:24.674
There's definitely something
that she was holding back.

25:24.676 --> 25:26.209
You had thought
she wouldn't rattle.

25:26.211 --> 25:26.955
She won't.

25:26.979 --> 25:28.660
We're gonna have to
find some other way in.

25:30.231 --> 25:31.231
[Ring]

25:31.232 --> 25:33.182
Top of the morning,
fellow leprechauns.

25:33.184 --> 25:35.568
Where did Lisa Randall go
after she met with JJ and Morgan?

25:35.570 --> 25:38.004
According to her credit card...

25:38.006 --> 25:39.439
Drugstores.

25:39.441 --> 25:40.907
5 of them, to be precise.

25:40.909 --> 25:43.242
And she bought a single item
5 times.

25:43.244 --> 25:45.478
All right, thanks.
Diaper rash cream.

25:45.480 --> 25:47.080
JJ, see if she'll come in
and talk.

25:47.082 --> 25:50.199
Reid, I need you
to go to the drugstore.

26:02.547 --> 26:04.714
Mm.

26:06.051 --> 26:08.434
Hmm.

26:08.436 --> 26:09.436
Hi.

26:09.437 --> 26:12.021
Hi.

26:12.023 --> 26:15.024
You sleep?

26:15.026 --> 26:17.527
I never really sleep.

26:17.529 --> 26:19.696
[Knock on door]
Hi, Jane, honey, come on.

26:19.698 --> 26:20.897
Quick like a bunny.

26:20.899 --> 26:21.864
Oh, it's Lisa.

26:21.866 --> 26:23.066
What the hell
is she doing here?

26:23.068 --> 26:25.118
Well, she takes me
to the meetings sometimes.

26:25.120 --> 26:26.235
[Pounding on door]

26:26.237 --> 26:28.237
[Distorted voice]
Hey, open this door!

26:28.239 --> 26:29.605
Open this door right now!

26:29.607 --> 26:33.443
Hi, honey, it's me.
Are you in there?

26:33.445 --> 26:36.079
[Distorted voice]
Jane, open this door!

26:36.081 --> 26:38.464
Get rid of her.

26:39.384 --> 26:42.468
Calm down.
She's one of us, right?

26:42.470 --> 26:45.888
[Muffled voices]

26:45.890 --> 26:47.223
Are you in there?

26:47.225 --> 26:49.942
[Cell phone ringing]

26:49.944 --> 26:51.177
Don't.

26:51.179 --> 26:54.263
I want to see
who it is.

26:54.265 --> 26:55.932
[Beep]
Hello?

26:55.934 --> 26:56.983
It's probably--

26:56.985 --> 26:58.935
Be quiet.

26:58.937 --> 27:01.187
Yes, Agent Jareau.

27:02.524 --> 27:05.758
Yes. Yes, I'll come down
to the station.

27:09.280 --> 27:10.947
She--she's talking
to the police?

27:10.949 --> 27:13.282
Why would she talk to
the police like that?

27:13.284 --> 27:14.784
No, no, she called
somebody an agent.

27:14.786 --> 27:16.335
That--that's not the
police, it's the feds.

27:16.337 --> 27:19.122
What do they want with us?

27:19.124 --> 27:21.340
[Whispering]

27:22.794 --> 27:25.011
I'll take care of it.
Just hold on.

27:31.469 --> 27:35.304
Ms. Randall, I'm Aaron
Hotchner with the FBI.

27:35.306 --> 27:37.140
I have already told
the other agents

27:37.142 --> 27:40.510
everything that
I have to say.

27:40.512 --> 27:42.178
Do you know
why you itch?

27:42.180 --> 27:45.898
Well, my neurologist tried to explain it
as simply as he could to me

27:45.900 --> 27:47.817
so I would stop coming
to his office.

27:47.819 --> 27:50.787
My amygdala, which is
the emotional center of my brain,

27:50.789 --> 27:52.872
has hijacked
my prefrontal cortex,

27:52.874 --> 27:54.323
which is the rational side.

27:54.325 --> 27:56.476
So in times of stress,
I itch.

27:56.478 --> 27:59.162
But, look at me now.

27:59.164 --> 28:01.380
I'm in the FBI office
being questioned.

28:01.382 --> 28:03.499
One would think that would be
a very stressful thing

28:03.501 --> 28:05.818
for anyone
and I'm not itching.

28:06.955 --> 28:09.188
How old was she
when she died?

28:10.842 --> 28:11.874
Excuse me?

28:11.876 --> 28:13.810
Did she make it
to her third birthday?

28:13.812 --> 28:16.512
I don't know
who you talked to,

28:16.514 --> 28:17.814
but you have no right.

28:17.816 --> 28:19.132
I haven't talked
to anyone.

28:19.134 --> 28:21.768
I'm trained to see
what's in front of me.

28:21.770 --> 28:26.672
I notice that you don't wear a
wedding ring under your gloves.

28:26.674 --> 28:28.858
I think a condition like
yours makes it difficult

28:28.860 --> 28:31.027
to build intimate
relationships.

28:31.029 --> 28:33.496
I know you looked everywhere
for some sort of relief.

28:33.498 --> 28:36.482
Doctors' prescriptions, antihistamines.
None of it worked.

28:36.484 --> 28:39.418
Nothing
until you found this.

28:40.705 --> 28:43.439
This works, doesn't it?

28:44.876 --> 28:46.542
Yes.

28:50.882 --> 28:52.381
Someone who's not a mother

28:52.383 --> 28:55.551
doesn't stumble on a cure
like that by accident.

29:00.608 --> 29:02.458
What was her name?

29:08.149 --> 29:10.550
Olivia.

29:10.552 --> 29:12.368
She was a preemie.

29:12.370 --> 29:16.572
So she was in and out
of hospitals a lot.

29:18.326 --> 29:21.911
Her skin at the end...

29:21.913 --> 29:26.916
I guess it was from
the tests and everything.

29:26.918 --> 29:28.584
I was a new parent.

29:28.586 --> 29:33.673
Do you know that feeling
of, am I doing it right?

29:33.675 --> 29:35.591
Am I helping?

29:35.593 --> 29:39.645
You know?
You just don't know.

29:39.647 --> 29:42.982
I'm also trained to listen
to what people say,

29:42.984 --> 29:45.601
and that question,
am I helping?

29:45.603 --> 29:49.605
You ask yourself that
every day, don't you?

29:49.607 --> 29:52.942
I know you help the people
who come to your meetings.

29:52.944 --> 29:54.977
I know you want to help us.

29:54.979 --> 29:56.979
I do?

29:56.981 --> 29:58.497
Yes, you do.
Because there's a man

29:58.499 --> 30:00.499
who comes to your meetings
who puts you on edge,

30:00.501 --> 30:01.951
and your instincts
of self-preservation

30:01.953 --> 30:03.502
are telling you
not to trust him,

30:03.504 --> 30:05.621
and those instincts
are always right.

30:05.623 --> 30:07.023
Who is he?

30:09.043 --> 30:10.593
His name is Leo.

30:10.595 --> 30:12.078
I don't have his number
or anything,

30:12.080 --> 30:16.632
but I did see him talking
to one of my friends last night--Jane.

30:16.634 --> 30:18.184
I knocked on her door
this morning.

30:18.186 --> 30:20.720
She didn't answer,
but there was someone inside

30:20.722 --> 30:22.355
because I heard them whispering.

30:22.357 --> 30:23.723
I need Jane's information
immediately.

30:23.725 --> 30:24.725
[Knocking]

30:24.726 --> 30:27.009
Jane Posner,
this is the FBI. Open up!

30:27.011 --> 30:29.028
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

30:29.030 --> 30:30.529
Kate: Open the door, Jane.

30:30.531 --> 30:32.365
No. No. He was right.

30:34.202 --> 30:35.368
[Gasps]

30:37.372 --> 30:40.039
We're not looking for you.
We're looking for Leo.

30:40.041 --> 30:41.324
He's not here.

30:41.326 --> 30:42.992
He's gone.
Clear.

30:42.994 --> 30:46.329
And you're never
gonna find him.

30:51.502 --> 30:54.587
Thank you so much.

31:07.018 --> 31:10.353
Have you ever heard
of a folie a deux, Jane?

31:10.355 --> 31:12.305
It's where two people

31:12.307 --> 31:15.391
suffer from the same
delusional belief.

31:15.393 --> 31:18.361
We're not delusional.

31:18.363 --> 31:19.845
He gets me.

31:19.847 --> 31:20.830
All right.

31:20.832 --> 31:22.365
Then tell us
where he is

31:22.367 --> 31:24.700
so we can understand
what the two of you have.

31:24.702 --> 31:25.702
You'll kill him.

31:25.703 --> 31:27.003
JJ: We're not killers.

31:27.005 --> 31:28.904
We're his best hope
for getting better.

31:28.906 --> 31:31.457
All we want to do
is get him the help he needs.

31:31.459 --> 31:33.192
Why should I believe you?

31:33.194 --> 31:35.127
You already
tried to kill him once.

31:35.129 --> 31:37.730
When was that?

31:37.732 --> 31:39.598
don't play dumb.
With the vaccinations.

31:39.600 --> 31:42.134
What vaccinations?

31:43.721 --> 31:45.388
I don't have to
talk to you. So...

31:45.390 --> 31:48.224
No, all you got to do
is listen.

31:48.226 --> 31:50.559
'Cause the closer we get
to the truth,

31:50.561 --> 31:52.561
the more you're going to
be compelled to itch.

31:52.563 --> 31:55.531
The first victim
who met Leo

31:55.533 --> 31:57.383
was going to write a story
about vaccinations.

31:57.385 --> 31:58.951
Is that how this all started,

31:58.953 --> 32:02.071
because Leo got
vaccinations?

32:02.073 --> 32:04.206
Hmm. That's a yes.

32:04.208 --> 32:08.044
Find out who gave him
the vaccinations, we find Leo.

32:08.046 --> 32:10.780
Was it his doctor?

32:12.850 --> 32:14.684
Nope, wasn't his doctor.

32:14.686 --> 32:16.302
Must have been work, then.

32:16.304 --> 32:20.006
Was it the military?
Did Leo serve?

32:20.008 --> 32:22.808
It's not military.

32:22.810 --> 32:24.593
Did he work in medicine?

32:26.481 --> 32:29.181
Is it the hospital?
Is that where he worked?

32:29.183 --> 32:32.151
Or was it something more like
infectious diseases?

32:32.153 --> 32:34.770
'Cause you'd have to get
vaccinated for that.

32:36.441 --> 32:38.441
Like the Centers
for Disease Control,

32:38.443 --> 32:40.776
right here in Atlanta.

32:40.778 --> 32:42.912
[Takes deep breath,
crying]

32:42.914 --> 32:44.330
Leave him alone.

32:44.332 --> 32:46.782
Let's go.

33:04.969 --> 33:06.302
What did you tell them?

33:06.304 --> 33:07.770
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
I didn't say anything.

33:07.772 --> 33:08.971
No, I didn't.
I didn't say anything.

33:08.973 --> 33:10.356
Let's go.

33:10.358 --> 33:12.024
Let's go.

33:19.374 --> 33:21.491
Leo Jenkins. Haven't
thought of him in a while.

33:21.493 --> 33:23.326
JJ: Our search told us
he worked here 6 months ago,

33:23.328 --> 33:24.961
but his address isn't current.

33:24.963 --> 33:27.330
Yeah, he asked me to send
his last check to a different address.

33:27.332 --> 33:28.832
He was pretty paranoid
by the end.

33:28.834 --> 33:30.500
Rossi: Because of
the vaccinations?

33:30.502 --> 33:31.835
Which he didn't
even need.

33:31.837 --> 33:33.469
I mean, he was
a low-level lab assistant,

33:33.471 --> 33:35.672
for god's sake.
We were trying to help him.

33:35.674 --> 33:38.308
Why would you give him
shots he didn't need?

33:38.310 --> 33:42.345
Leo had a painful
case of shingles in his left arm.

33:42.347 --> 33:46.249
One of the docs around here gave him
the antiviral acyclovir,

33:46.251 --> 33:49.319
which, uh, deadened
the nerves in his arm...

33:49.698 --> 33:51.231
altogether.
Here's his address.

33:51.233 --> 33:53.066
How did that lead
to cockroaches?

33:53.068 --> 33:54.734
Your brain
and nervous system

33:54.736 --> 33:57.620
work on a best-guess
feedback loop.

33:57.622 --> 34:00.707
The nerves might be dead,
but your brain hasn't figured that out yet.

34:00.709 --> 34:02.575
It's still sending stimuli
to the dead nerves

34:02.577 --> 34:04.077
in an attempt
to get them to react.

34:04.079 --> 34:06.713
Like an amputee who has feeling
in his phantom limb.

34:06.715 --> 34:11.333
Exactly. Leo started scratching
and he couldn't stop.

34:11.335 --> 34:14.353
Well, we told him the feelings will
come back when the drugs wore off,

34:14.356 --> 34:19.926
but, uh, he insisted that we'd put
cockroach larvae in his vaccine.

34:19.928 --> 34:23.246
That it was a conspiracy,
that we were all trying to kill him.

34:23.248 --> 34:25.197
We tried almost everything
to talk him out of it.

34:25.199 --> 34:27.016
Well, almost everything.

34:27.018 --> 34:29.819
What didn't you try?

34:42.117 --> 34:45.518
Leo, the FBI
is looking for you.

34:45.520 --> 34:48.588
Yeah, I know they are.

34:48.590 --> 34:52.225
What I don't know
is who you are.

34:54.362 --> 34:57.230
I had to rethink
everything I know about you.

34:57.232 --> 35:01.184
[Tapping]

35:01.186 --> 35:03.603
At the meetings,
when you shared

35:03.605 --> 35:05.938
about pulling the fibers
from your body

35:05.940 --> 35:08.474
and you said they felt
like spider legs...

35:08.476 --> 35:10.393
You talked about how
that made you feel crazy

35:10.395 --> 35:12.729
'cause you're afraid
of spider legs?

35:12.731 --> 35:14.347
But is that true?

35:14.349 --> 35:16.215
Are you afraid
of spiders, Lisa?

35:16.217 --> 35:17.517
Yes.

35:17.519 --> 35:18.818
You are?
Yes.

35:23.708 --> 35:26.042
No...You don't
have to do this.

35:26.044 --> 35:28.044
No, I do have to.
I do have to,

35:28.046 --> 35:32.048
because, see, I don't know
what the truth is anymore.

35:41.343 --> 35:42.392
No.

35:42.394 --> 35:45.595
See, you and I are gonna
have a little chat.

35:45.597 --> 35:47.347
Come on, Leo.

35:51.186 --> 35:54.020
I'll just tell you anything that
you want to know.

35:54.022 --> 35:55.456
Just tell me what
you want to know.

35:55.456 --> 35:57.424
It's simple.
Who do you work for?

35:58.026 --> 36:00.526
I don't--I don't work
for anybody.

36:09.204 --> 36:12.872
Leo: Who do you work for?
Who do you work for?

36:12.874 --> 36:14.290
I don't work for anybody!

36:14.292 --> 36:17.093
[Indistinct shouting]

36:17.095 --> 36:19.095
I just don't work
for anybody.

36:19.097 --> 36:20.430
You don't work for anybody?
You're unemployed?

36:20.432 --> 36:21.597
I don't know what
you want me to say.

36:21.599 --> 36:23.299
Who do you work for? Ok?

36:23.301 --> 36:25.835
We'll keep going. We'll keep going
until you give me...

36:25.837 --> 36:27.553
Who do you work for?
Ohh!

36:27.555 --> 36:28.721
I don't work for anybody!

36:28.723 --> 36:30.056
[Screaming] No!

36:30.058 --> 36:31.724
I don't work for anybody!

36:31.726 --> 36:32.809
Who do you work for?!

36:32.811 --> 36:34.894
FBI! don't move!

36:34.896 --> 36:37.480
Oh, God.

36:40.402 --> 36:42.485
Of course.

36:42.487 --> 36:44.237
She works for you,
doesn't she?

36:44.239 --> 36:46.239
We're not here for her.
We're here to talk to you.

36:46.241 --> 36:47.740
How about you let her go
and we'll do that.

36:47.742 --> 36:49.242
You want to talk?
Then how come these things

36:49.244 --> 36:51.494
in my arms are going crazy, huh?

36:51.496 --> 36:53.246
I know how this goes, ok?

36:53.248 --> 36:54.714
I know how this goes.
You shoot me

36:54.716 --> 36:56.666
and then you cover up
the whole thing. That's how it goes.

36:56.668 --> 36:58.084
Is it happening now?

36:58.086 --> 36:59.585
Of course it's happening now.

36:59.587 --> 37:01.087
Don't tell me
you don't see it.

37:01.089 --> 37:02.171
Come on, you see it.

37:02.173 --> 37:04.974
You see it!

37:04.976 --> 37:07.927
I can make it go away.

37:07.929 --> 37:10.430
[Lisa whimpers]

37:14.269 --> 37:17.937
Now, is that your phone?

37:19.357 --> 37:22.525
Yeah, that's my phone.

37:24.446 --> 37:26.946
Don't--what are you doing?

37:26.948 --> 37:30.867
Now, look at the camera.

37:30.869 --> 37:33.786
What? I've shot video footage
of myself a million times.

37:33.788 --> 37:35.621
You guys do something to it
and the image is gone.

37:35.623 --> 37:37.623
It's gone. You guys
do something to it.

37:37.625 --> 37:39.509
I'm not shooting video.

37:39.511 --> 37:40.877
This is a reflection.

37:40.879 --> 37:42.261
Now look at it.
Go ahead, look.

37:42.263 --> 37:44.380
Look at your arm.

37:48.136 --> 37:51.437
Is it going away?

37:54.442 --> 37:55.975
That's a trick.

37:55.977 --> 37:57.894
It's no trick.

37:57.896 --> 38:01.647
How did you do that?

38:01.649 --> 38:05.201
We can make them go away
forever.

38:05.203 --> 38:07.153
But you have to
let her go, Leo.

38:07.155 --> 38:08.488
What? Leo?

38:08.490 --> 38:10.990
How the hell
do you know my name?!

38:10.992 --> 38:12.825
Don't move,
don't even flinch.

38:12.827 --> 38:14.911
Get 'em off, get 'em off,
get 'em off, get 'em off!

38:14.913 --> 38:16.712
See 'em, see 'em, see 'em,
see 'em? Right there.

38:16.714 --> 38:17.830
Right there.

38:17.832 --> 38:19.499
I got 'em. I got 'em. Ok.

38:19.501 --> 38:21.717
I got 'em. I got 'em.

38:37.569 --> 38:39.402
So that's it?

38:39.404 --> 38:42.321
You ruin my life,
now I'm free to go?

38:42.323 --> 38:45.908
You're not an accessory.
You didn't know what Leo was doing.

38:45.910 --> 38:48.027
So, yeah,
you're free to go.

38:48.029 --> 38:49.662
You killed him, didn't you?

38:49.664 --> 38:51.414
I told you,
we're not killers.

38:51.416 --> 38:54.200
I don't believe you.

38:54.202 --> 38:55.368
You used me.

38:55.370 --> 38:59.372
You tricked me,
so you could get him.

39:00.375 --> 39:02.875
Jane, hey.

39:04.128 --> 39:08.431
Jane. Hey, hey, would you just listen
to me for a second, ok?

39:08.433 --> 39:09.515
Get away from me.

39:09.517 --> 39:10.716
Ok, yeah,
I had a job to do

39:10.718 --> 39:12.885
and I'm not going
to apologize for that.

39:12.887 --> 39:14.687
But that doesn't mean
that this is over.

39:14.689 --> 39:15.972
Leo, he still
needs you.

39:15.974 --> 39:17.390
How?

39:17.392 --> 39:19.108
He has a good chance
of pleading insanity,

39:19.110 --> 39:20.943
and he is going to need
someone on his side

39:20.945 --> 39:22.862
to explain his condition
to the court.

39:22.864 --> 39:25.898
Oh, yeah. 'Cause if he's insane,
you could put him away forever.

39:25.900 --> 39:27.199
Of course you didn't kill him,

39:27.201 --> 39:29.151
'cause that would make
a martyr out of him.

39:29.153 --> 39:32.071
But if he's crazy, no one
will ever know what I know.

39:32.073 --> 39:34.073
Nobody. Which is
that he's right!

39:34.075 --> 39:35.908
Ok? About the government

39:35.910 --> 39:37.209
and the drinking water

39:37.211 --> 39:40.997
and you. All of it!

39:40.999 --> 39:43.966
He was going to kill Lisa.

39:45.253 --> 39:46.919
He--he wouldn't do that.

39:46.921 --> 39:48.754
I was there.

39:48.756 --> 39:51.591
He had a gun
to her head.

39:54.596 --> 39:56.762
Mm. Lies.

39:56.764 --> 39:59.649
Lies, lies, and more lies.

39:59.651 --> 40:03.402
And you FBI jackbooted thugs

40:03.404 --> 40:05.438
will do anything
to protect yourselves

40:05.440 --> 40:07.406
from him exposing you

40:07.408 --> 40:10.276
as the filthy liars
that you are.

40:16.951 --> 40:19.835
Rossi, that was
a pretty gutsy move.

40:19.837 --> 40:21.203
How'd you know
it was gonna work?

40:21.205 --> 40:24.340
The doc at the CDC told us
about something they wanted to try

40:24.342 --> 40:25.708
but never got around to.

40:25.710 --> 40:27.126
It's called
a mirror box.

40:27.128 --> 40:28.461
Oh, I read about
that treatment.

40:28.463 --> 40:29.879
What's this treatment?

40:29.881 --> 40:31.881
It's for amputees with searing pain
in their phantom limbs.

40:31.883 --> 40:33.933
Basically, you take a patient,
you put them in front of a mirror

40:33.935 --> 40:35.801
and you tell them
to conduct a symphony,

40:35.803 --> 40:37.219
to wave,
or just to relax.

40:37.221 --> 40:39.472
When their brain sees
what's not there, the pain goes away.

40:39.474 --> 40:41.641
And since the unsub
had dead nerves in his arm

40:41.643 --> 40:43.926
due to the shingles
antiviral...

40:43.928 --> 40:45.111
You could argue
that his itch

40:45.113 --> 40:46.562
was the same thing
as phantom limb pain,

40:46.564 --> 40:49.315
I mean from a brain-
nervous system feedback loop.

40:49.317 --> 40:51.484
My hope was that the trick
would make the itch go away,

40:51.486 --> 40:53.602
and it did, for a few seconds,
anyway.

40:53.604 --> 40:55.454
I can understand
being driven crazy

40:55.456 --> 40:57.123
by something
you can't scratch,

40:57.125 --> 40:59.792
but killing people over it,
that's what surprises me.

40:59.794 --> 41:01.293
There is one documented case
about a woman

41:01.295 --> 41:03.546
who couldn't stop scratching,
even when she was asleep.

41:03.548 --> 41:06.215
She woke up one morning
realizing she'd scratched

41:06.217 --> 41:08.000
through her own scalp,
her skull,

41:08.002 --> 41:09.669
