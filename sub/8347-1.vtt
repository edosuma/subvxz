00:30.300 --> 00:34.134
The city of Townsville...

00:34.671 --> 00:37.105
...is in some serious...

00:37.274 --> 00:42.075
...serious, serious trouble!

00:42.245 --> 00:43.337
Day after day...

00:44.681 --> 00:49.345
...crime, lawlessness
and evil are running rampant.

00:49.519 --> 00:51.749
Its citizens have lost all hope.

00:53.123 --> 00:58.493
They are utterly helpless
and in desperate need of a true hero.

00:58.662 --> 00:59.959
But who?

01:00.130 --> 01:03.497
Is there no one who can help
this forsaken town...

01:03.667 --> 01:06.261
...and make it a better place?

01:06.436 --> 01:12.534
Fear not, fair viewers, for there
is a man, a man of science...

01:12.709 --> 01:17.169
...a forward-thinking man,
who looks back to a sweeter time...

01:20.617 --> 01:25.281
... when there was spice to life,
and everything was...nice.

01:28.625 --> 01:30.149
I must profess, sir...

01:30.327 --> 01:34.696
... this man holds the ingredients
to Townsville 's salvation!

01:34.865 --> 01:37.629
This man, known simply as:

01:38.602 --> 01:40.126
The Professor.

03:34.117 --> 03:35.846
Hi!

03:36.019 --> 03:37.748
What's your name?

03:38.755 --> 03:43.954
My name is Professor.
Professor Utonium. Hello!

03:44.127 --> 03:48.291
Hello, Professor Utonium.
It's very nice to meet you.

03:48.698 --> 03:51.030
It's very nice to meet you too.

03:52.035 --> 03:56.631
-What are your names?.
-You made us, so shouldn't you name us?.

03:58.408 --> 04:01.775
Okay. This is so cool!

04:01.945 --> 04:03.640
Well, now, let's see.

04:03.813 --> 04:09.217
Because of your directness and opening
right up to me, I think I'll call you...

04:09.386 --> 04:10.546
...Blossom.

04:12.289 --> 04:17.226
Well, aren't you all cute and bubbly!
That's it! You'll be my little...

04:17.394 --> 04:18.383
...Bubbles.

04:18.562 --> 04:21.861
So we have Blossom, Bubbles and...

04:22.666 --> 04:24.463
...Buttercup. Because...

04:24.634 --> 04:26.602
...it also begins with a B.

04:26.770 --> 04:30.331
And together you are
three perfect little g--

04:30.507 --> 04:34.739
Gifts! Birthday! It's your birthday!
I should get gifts!

04:34.911 --> 04:39.041
Wow! I wanted to make some kids
I could teach right from wrong...

04:39.216 --> 04:42.913
...and in turn, maybe they'd do good
for this town, and now I can!

04:44.154 --> 04:46.782
All I gotta do is be a good parent.

04:50.460 --> 04:53.861
Note to self:. Good parents
don't leave kids alone.

04:54.030 --> 04:55.964
Sugar, spice and everything nice.

04:56.132 --> 04:58.362
Who knew that's what girls
were made of!

04:58.535 --> 05:01.095
I can't believe I made perfect girls!

05:01.271 --> 05:03.239
Three normal little gi--

05:03.773 --> 05:08.301
You should be careful when coming
down the steps! You could get hurt.

05:08.478 --> 05:10.946
Hey, are these for us?.

05:14.117 --> 05:16.551
Thanks, Professor!

05:38.708 --> 05:41.609
-Hey, thanks!
-Yes, Professor! Thank you.

05:41.778 --> 05:44.110
This is the best gift ever...

05:44.281 --> 05:46.511
...Dad.

05:50.420 --> 05:53.082
Yes, it is.

06:15.078 --> 06:17.979
Okay, girls, now watch me.

06:25.221 --> 06:27.883
I think you missed a spot.

06:30.460 --> 06:33.122
I'll go wash up,
then we'll bring in the furniture.

06:36.399 --> 06:38.560
Girls, wait! You should let me--

06:38.735 --> 06:40.362
Help?.

06:45.975 --> 06:48.773
This looks pretty good.
What do you think?.

06:49.346 --> 06:52.440
-I think it's a little dark.
-I like it dark.

06:52.615 --> 06:56.949
-Some windows might be nice.
-Yeah! I could see some windows.

06:57.120 --> 06:59.418
Right about here.

06:59.589 --> 07:01.682
I'll call a contractor tomor--

07:10.233 --> 07:12.667
Or that works too.

07:12.836 --> 07:14.394
Who's hungry?.

07:14.571 --> 07:15.833
-Ready?.
-Ready!

07:16.005 --> 07:17.495
Go!

07:45.635 --> 07:47.500
Okay, girls. Time for--

07:53.309 --> 07:55.209
Bed.

08:34.884 --> 08:38.877
-Wake up, girls! Time for school.
-What's school?.

08:39.055 --> 08:42.320
This is school.
I'm your teacher, Ms. Keane...

08:42.492 --> 08:46.553
...and this is where
kids come to learn. See?.

08:51.367 --> 08:52.732
You wanna play?.

08:58.908 --> 09:00.432
Do you think they'll be okay?.

09:00.610 --> 09:04.603
I'm new at this parenting thing,
and I wanted to meet you...

09:04.781 --> 09:08.512
...because they're really special.
I mean, really special...

09:08.685 --> 09:14.646
...and I just want to make sure they'll
be okay. Do you think they'll be okay?.

09:15.825 --> 09:19.522
They'll be just fine, Professor.
We'll see you at noon.

09:19.696 --> 09:25.794
Okay. Bye, girls. Bye. Bye.
Bye-bye. Bye. Bye.

09:27.604 --> 09:30.266
Okay, class. Take your seats.

09:30.440 --> 09:34.001
-Can Blossom sit with us?.
-Can we sit with Bubbles?.

09:34.177 --> 09:35.769
Can Buttercup sit here?.

09:35.945 --> 09:40.507
The girls can sit right in the middle,
so they'll be next to everyone.

09:43.086 --> 09:45.554
Now, let's begin!

09:50.393 --> 09:52.486
Hello, Professor.
Right on time.

09:52.662 --> 09:54.926
Your girls are outside
with the others.

09:55.098 --> 09:57.828
Oh, no! Look at this mess.

09:58.001 --> 10:01.630
I knew the girls would
be a handful, but I'm so sorry.

10:01.804 --> 10:03.396
What, this?.

10:03.573 --> 10:06.872
This is what happens
when you put 20 kids in one room.

10:07.043 --> 10:08.806
Your girls were perfect.

10:08.978 --> 10:11.947
Perfect, normal,
well-behaved little girls.

10:12.115 --> 10:15.676
-Nothing out of the ordinary?.
-No. Like what?.

10:18.588 --> 10:22.649
-That was sweet!
-What's the point of this game, anyway?.

10:22.825 --> 10:25.191
Tag! You're it!

10:30.333 --> 10:33.700
Everyone's running from her
like she's been infected!

10:33.870 --> 10:37.328
-Maybe she's a freak.
-Yeah, and they hate her!

10:37.507 --> 10:39.407
-You're it!
-Tag! You're it!

10:39.576 --> 10:42.443
Oh, no! I've been affected!

10:42.612 --> 10:47.140
-All right, what's going on here?.
-I've been affected!

10:47.317 --> 10:50.548
You're not infected, it's just a game.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.415
-lt is?.
-Yeah.

10:52.589 --> 10:56.355
-A game?. Neat!
-Yeah, how do we play?.

10:56.759 --> 11:00.786
Okay, look, it's very simple.
Bubbles, tag me.

11:01.731 --> 11:04.165
Come on, it's okay.

11:07.804 --> 11:10.102
All right, now I'm it.

11:10.273 --> 11:15.677
And all you gots to do to play
is tag someone else, and they're it.

11:16.446 --> 11:18.141
By the way, you're it!

11:18.314 --> 11:21.374
Awesome, I'm it! What do I do?.
What do I do?.

11:21.551 --> 11:27.285
Just tag someone else,
and they're it!

11:38.034 --> 11:41.231
Time to put it into overdrive,
Bubbles!

12:00.690 --> 12:04.387
Tag! You're it!

12:07.830 --> 12:09.821
I'm gonna tag you guys now.

12:16.572 --> 12:18.199
You missed us!

12:23.579 --> 12:27.709
-Tag! You're it!
-No! No, I'm not!

12:28.017 --> 12:30.178
Tag! You're it!

12:30.853 --> 12:32.514
Tag!

12:32.722 --> 12:34.519
Missed me!

12:35.291 --> 12:37.156
No, you're it!

12:37.794 --> 12:38.783
Tag!

12:38.961 --> 12:40.758
I'm it?.

12:40.930 --> 12:42.363
Tag!

12:42.532 --> 12:44.693
Tag! Got you!

12:46.803 --> 12:49.033
-Got you!
-Missed me!

12:55.712 --> 12:57.907
Girls, no! Wait!

13:30.613 --> 13:33.013
Can't catch me!

13:44.727 --> 13:46.490
Oh, no!

14:41.784 --> 14:43.081
Subway, huh?.

14:56.165 --> 14:57.860
Tag. You're it.

15:04.807 --> 15:05.796
There they--

15:10.246 --> 15:11.543
Here she comes!

15:43.045 --> 15:44.569
Suckers.

15:46.682 --> 15:48.343
Tag. You're it.

15:48.517 --> 15:51.509
You know, I've got a nice car.

15:56.525 --> 15:58.356
-You're it.
-No, you're it!

15:58.527 --> 15:59.516
Hey!

16:07.670 --> 16:09.763
She'll never find us up here.

16:11.173 --> 16:12.606
Do you hear something?.

16:16.345 --> 16:17.369
Run!

16:17.647 --> 16:19.444
Tag! You're both it!

16:19.615 --> 16:20.741
Hey!

16:20.917 --> 16:23.977
-We can't both be it.
-Why not?.

16:24.153 --> 16:27.122
-Tag.
-What?. I can't be it twice!

16:27.290 --> 16:30.350
-Why not?.
-Okay then.

16:30.526 --> 16:32.790
Tag. Now you guys are it.

16:32.962 --> 16:34.293
-Tag.
-Tags.

16:34.463 --> 16:36.931
-Hey, no tag backs! Tag!
-Tag!

16:37.099 --> 16:38.088
-Tag!
-Tag!

16:38.267 --> 16:39.256
-Tag!
-Tag!

16:41.871 --> 16:43.634
-Tag!
-Tag!

16:43.806 --> 16:46.798
-You're it!
-You're it!

17:01.557 --> 17:03.252
Oh, boy.

17:05.061 --> 17:07.552
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.834
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

17:18.507 --> 17:19.496
Oh, boy.

17:19.675 --> 17:24.169
Mayor, the town is being destroyed
by three girls with freakish powers.

17:24.347 --> 17:28.044
This is a very serious situation.
What action should we take?.

17:28.217 --> 17:30.014
-Tag, tag!
-Tag, tag, tag!

17:31.120 --> 17:34.055
Don't worry. We have the situation
under control.

17:34.223 --> 17:36.020
-Oh, boy.
-I know, sir.

17:39.895 --> 17:41.954
-Oh, boy.
-You tell them, Mayor.

17:42.131 --> 17:44.258
Townsville will not stand for this.

17:48.137 --> 17:51.231
Mayor?. Hello?.
City being destroyed?.

17:51.407 --> 17:53.875
-Where are you going?.
-Oh, boy.

17:56.579 --> 17:59.480
Mayor, where are you going?.
We're in a serious pickle.

17:59.648 --> 18:01.115
Exactly.

18:02.118 --> 18:03.779
Girls, no!

18:04.854 --> 18:06.879
Hello.

18:07.056 --> 18:09.650
Hello.

18:09.825 --> 18:11.554
The usual, Cucor.

18:13.629 --> 18:18.692
I have a fine vintage for you here.
Picked fresh today.

18:19.335 --> 18:21.326
Oh, boy!

18:43.292 --> 18:45.988
Girls, girls, are you okay?.

18:46.162 --> 18:49.859
Tag! You're it, Professor!

19:30.573 --> 19:36.034
Okay, girls. Girls, it's almost
bedtime, okay?. Girls?.

19:36.212 --> 19:39.238
Come on, Professor, you're it.
You gotta catch us.

19:39.515 --> 19:42.040
Yes, I suppose I do, don't l?.

19:48.390 --> 19:50.517
Got you, you little bunny.

19:51.660 --> 19:54.322
Help! I got caughted!
Blossom, watch out!

19:54.497 --> 19:56.988
You're the sole survivor!

19:57.166 --> 19:59.464
No way, Professor!
You can't catch me.

19:59.635 --> 20:03.799
Yes, I can because the game's over,
and it's your bedtime.

20:03.973 --> 20:06.908
Now come up here so we can catch you.

20:13.115 --> 20:17.484
Well now, three little girls had
a very busy day today, didn't they?.

20:17.887 --> 20:20.481
Yeah, it was fun.
We met lots of kids.

20:20.656 --> 20:23.921
-And we learned things.
-And we played tag!

20:24.093 --> 20:28.496
I'm glad you had so much fun
because tomorrow will be busy too.

20:28.664 --> 20:33.499
Put your nighties on and get in bed.
We need to talk about something.

20:33.669 --> 20:36.866
-Okay, everybody in?.
-Yep, what's up, Daddy-o?.

20:37.039 --> 20:39.599
Well, it's your super powers.

20:39.775 --> 20:42.005
I'm not sure how to say this...

20:42.178 --> 20:45.272
...but I don't think you should
use them in public anymore.

20:45.514 --> 20:46.776
Why?.

20:47.016 --> 20:50.315
Well, your powers
are very special and unique...

20:50.486 --> 20:54.115
...and although we have a lot of fun
doing things in the house...

20:54.290 --> 21:00.251
...out in Townsville, people don't
understand how special you girls are.

21:00.429 --> 21:04.024
And unfortunately, people
often get scared or angry...

21:04.200 --> 21:07.294
...when they don't understand
something special or unique.

21:07.469 --> 21:08.663
That's silly.

21:08.837 --> 21:14.605
I think so too, but nonetheless, take
it easy with the powers tomorrow.

21:14.777 --> 21:18.941
Just give Townsville a little time
to understand your specialness, okay?.

21:19.114 --> 21:20.103
-Okay.
-Okay.

21:20.282 --> 21:23.308
-Yeah.
-People are nice. Things will be fine.

21:46.175 --> 21:50.236
So I'll be waiting here to pick you up
when school gets out, okay?.

21:50.412 --> 21:54.644
Okay, but don't worry, Professor.
Things are gonna be fine.

22:00.990 --> 22:04.653
Girls, we didn't know
if you'd be joining us today.

22:05.227 --> 22:07.957
Take your seats.

22:10.699 --> 22:15.102
I'm sorry to say there won't be
any recess for a while...

22:15.271 --> 22:17.899
...due to all the reconstruction.

22:18.073 --> 22:23.739
Secondly, I'm afraid we won't have
any lights or water for a while.

22:23.912 --> 22:27.848
And a broken refrigerator
means snack-time is out...

22:28.017 --> 22:32.454
...so let's try to ignore
all the workmen and noise and such...

22:32.621 --> 22:35.613
...and get right to work, shall we?.

22:36.292 --> 22:40.023
Girls, can you recite
the alphabet for us?.

22:44.366 --> 22:47.802
Girls?. ABCs?.

22:48.504 --> 22:53.464
A, B, C, D.... E!

22:53.642 --> 22:56.702
Hey, galldang it!
You done darn broke my board.

22:56.879 --> 22:58.904
Flamdanggling consarglers.

22:59.081 --> 23:00.878
F....

23:05.421 --> 23:07.912
Almost time to pick up the girls.

23:08.090 --> 23:09.079
Better motor.

23:10.492 --> 23:12.289
That's him, boys!

23:12.461 --> 23:16.227
He's in cahoots
with the evil pickle-cart killers...

23:16.398 --> 23:20.232
...cucumber crushers,
vinegar varlets, dill-stroyers!

23:20.402 --> 23:22.393
Why, it's not kosher! It's--

23:22.571 --> 23:25.005
Let it go, Mayor. Let it go.

23:26.342 --> 23:29.436
-Are these your babies?.
-Yes, but they were just playing.

23:29.611 --> 23:34.275
They're really very good little girls.
And I need to pick them up from school.

23:34.450 --> 23:36.384
I understand, sir...

23:36.552 --> 23:41.455
...but we want you to come downtown
with us to ask you a few questions.

23:42.424 --> 23:46.224
You guys, my kids.
I really ought to pick them up.

23:46.862 --> 23:48.853
I can't just leave them there...

23:49.031 --> 23:51.090
...alone.

24:09.585 --> 24:14.420
He's not coming. He hates us.
He totally hates us.

24:15.190 --> 24:18.489
No, he probably just got held up,
or maybe the car broke...

24:18.660 --> 24:20.958
...or maybe he forgot...

24:21.130 --> 24:23.462
...or maybe he hates us.

24:24.333 --> 24:28.497
Come on, let's try
and find our way home.

24:30.873 --> 24:34.206
We're not supposed to use our powers.

24:35.611 --> 24:37.875
Come on, girls.

24:49.792 --> 24:53.125
The cause?
Three super powered little girls.

24:53.295 --> 24:56.321
Should manufacturing
super powered children be illegal?

24:56.498 --> 24:59.934
A great travesty has befallen
our beloved city.

25:00.102 --> 25:05.404
I was easing the seat back when this
atomic punk flies in with no warning.

25:05.574 --> 25:08.065
The devastation? Devastating.

25:08.310 --> 25:09.675
It should be illegal.

25:09.845 --> 25:12.837
Used to be a time when
you could buy an honest pickle.

25:13.015 --> 25:15.506
They were lighting up the sky.

25:15.684 --> 25:20.348
Estimated dollars in damages?
A whopping 25 million.

25:20.522 --> 25:22.387
I'm offended just looking at them.

25:22.558 --> 25:27.052
The kind that you can only find
at a pickle cart.

25:27.329 --> 25:29.627
Now Jamie's crying.

25:29.798 --> 25:33.495
-Well, it seems that--
-Hatred is running rampant for--

25:33.669 --> 25:37.230
-Those mutant, bug-eyed--
-Pickle-cart killing--

25:37.406 --> 25:39.306
Freaks. Back to you, Linda.

25:39.541 --> 25:43.568
They are little freaks, aren 't they?
With more on this subject is--

25:50.118 --> 25:54.782
Get them out. We don't need them.
We don't need them.

26:03.899 --> 26:06.265
We interrupt this program
for a news flash.

26:06.435 --> 26:09.029
Arrested in connection
with the tag incident...

26:09.204 --> 26:13.800
...was the scientist responsible for
creating the girls, Professor Utonium.

26:13.976 --> 26:17.309
Upon incarceration,
the Professor made this statement:

26:17.479 --> 26:21.540
Please, just let me go.
My girls, they need me.

26:22.084 --> 26:24.575
They don't know I'm in jail.

26:26.622 --> 26:29.648
What if they try
to go home themselves?

26:31.793 --> 26:35.251
They can't find their way
if they don't fly.

26:38.033 --> 26:42.993
Please, they're only little girls
who are probably cold, scared...

26:43.171 --> 26:47.005
...and maybe even lost.

26:52.114 --> 26:56.448
Well, it' s official.
I have no idea where we are.

26:56.618 --> 26:59.644
Well, I can't say
it's been the best day.

26:59.821 --> 27:03.757
But it probably couldn't
get much worse.

27:09.231 --> 27:13.531
Hey, it's okay. Maybe there's
a box we can get in around back.

27:13.735 --> 27:15.293
Come on.

27:20.509 --> 27:23.672
See, there's a whole bunch of boxes.

27:40.529 --> 27:43.225
What's the matter?.

27:43.398 --> 27:46.663
Did somebody get lost?.

28:22.471 --> 28:23.665
Wow, thanks!

28:23.839 --> 28:26.103
Hey, wait! Come back.

28:39.187 --> 28:40.814
Hey, guys, over here.

28:40.989 --> 28:44.288
-Hi. What's your name?. I'm Blossom.
-Buttercup.

28:44.459 --> 28:46.984
And I'm Bubbles.

28:47.162 --> 28:51.292
Go away, please. Do not look at me.

28:51.466 --> 28:54.993
We just wanted to thank you
for saving us from those gangsters.

28:55.170 --> 28:57.832
That was amazing
with the trashcan lid.

28:58.006 --> 29:00.907
It was all: swoosh, bang,
splash, bam, boom.

29:01.076 --> 29:02.304
Yeah, you rock.

29:03.245 --> 29:07.306
No, please. I dare not listen...

29:07.482 --> 29:12.215
...for I have been lashed
by harsh tongues for too long.

29:12.387 --> 29:16.721
Alas, my little ones, I do not rock.

29:16.892 --> 29:21.852
For l, Jojo, am a monster.

29:24.633 --> 29:27.193
You're not a monster.
Monsters are evil.

29:27.369 --> 29:30.600
Anybody who would save us
like you did is so not evil.

29:30.772 --> 29:34.003
You're no monster, mister.
You're just really dirty.

29:34.509 --> 29:38.070
Please. You're just trying
to make me feel better.

29:38.246 --> 29:42.444
But my pain is not for you
to understand.

29:42.651 --> 29:44.050
Besides, how could you?.

29:44.219 --> 29:50.715
For you are pure and innocent
and, most certainly, loved.

29:50.892 --> 29:54.225
How could you know what it is
to be cast out...

29:54.396 --> 29:58.958
...into a world
that only offers misery?.

29:59.134 --> 30:03.798
How could you know what it's like
for people to fear and despise you...

30:03.972 --> 30:06.668
...for the very things
that make you special...

30:06.875 --> 30:10.402
...because you don't fit in,
because you are...

30:10.579 --> 30:12.740
...a freak?.!

30:15.717 --> 30:17.116
Because...

30:18.887 --> 30:21.048
...we're freaks too.

30:21.490 --> 30:24.550
-What amazing powers!
-No, they're terrible.

30:24.726 --> 30:27.524
-I bet everyone hates them.
-Yeah.

30:27.696 --> 30:31.188
-And they hate you too.
-Yes.

30:33.135 --> 30:35.569
I am in the same boat.

30:35.737 --> 30:40.504
This brain is full of brilliant ideas.

30:40.675 --> 30:45.044
But will anyone listen?. No.

30:45.213 --> 30:48.410
Nothing in this gray matters.

30:48.583 --> 30:51.017
So, what's the point?.

30:55.657 --> 30:58.626
Jojo, don't be sad.

30:58.794 --> 31:02.662
Our dad says people get angry
when they don't understand...

31:02.831 --> 31:04.662
...something special or unique.

31:04.833 --> 31:09.099
If you just give people time, they'll
start to understand your specialness.

31:09.271 --> 31:12.297
Yeah. You just gotta believe
in yourself.

31:12.474 --> 31:16.843
If I construct my Help-the-town-
and-make-it-a-better-place machine...

31:17.012 --> 31:20.209
...people will come to understand
my specialness?.

31:21.082 --> 31:22.845
I'll do it,
but I'll need your help.

31:24.986 --> 31:27.284
Jump in, take this device
into the volcano.

31:27.455 --> 31:30.515
We need to harness the energy
of the Earth's core for power.

31:30.692 --> 31:32.557
-What are you talking about?.
-The plan.

31:32.727 --> 31:34.251
-What plan?.
-Our plan.

31:34.429 --> 31:36.761
-To do what?.
-To make the town better.

31:36.932 --> 31:38.399
-What?.
-You know.

31:38.567 --> 31:42.594
We will build the Help-the-town-
and-make-it-a-better-place machine.

31:42.771 --> 31:47.003
Everyone will see our special
abilities are good. They will love us.

31:47.175 --> 31:49.200
Remember?. It was your idea.

31:50.011 --> 31:52.946
Oh, yeah. But use our powers?.

31:53.114 --> 31:54.877
-Yes.
-No way.

31:55.050 --> 31:57.041
-Come on.
-No.

31:57.219 --> 32:00.245
We're never using our powers again.

32:00.422 --> 32:03.152
Girls, don't be sad.

32:03.325 --> 32:08.456
Your powers are great.
You just gotta believe in yourself.

32:42.530 --> 32:45.260
Yes! Yes! Yes!

32:45.433 --> 32:50.803
-We did good?.
-You did very good. Very good indeed.

32:50.972 --> 32:54.408
-Now what do we do?.
-We construct the superstructure.

33:59.674 --> 34:02.700
Look. Can't you see
our plan is working?.

34:02.877 --> 34:07.712
Our work is proceeding as planned.
At last, our lives will be better.

34:08.049 --> 34:10.609
At last, we will be accepted.

34:10.785 --> 34:14.744
At last, our greatest work is comple--

34:15.323 --> 34:16.915
-Oops.
-What's wrong?.

34:17.092 --> 34:18.753
Well...

34:18.927 --> 34:24.524
...there is one last teeny-tiny,
itsy-bitsy thing we still need.

34:39.981 --> 34:42.643
Yes! Yes! Yes!

34:42.817 --> 34:48.119
-We did good?.
-You did very good. Very good indeed.

34:48.289 --> 34:49.688
Now what do we do?.

34:49.858 --> 34:53.123
Well, because you've done so good...

34:53.294 --> 34:56.855
...I've got a special surprise.

36:14.642 --> 36:16.473
-Worthless.
-Lame.

36:16.644 --> 36:18.669
-Stupid.
-Okay.

36:18.847 --> 36:21.008
-Better.
-Almost.

36:22.016 --> 36:23.506
Awesome!

36:43.972 --> 36:46.031
Come, girls, our work is fin--

36:46.741 --> 36:48.606
I mean, time to go.

36:50.278 --> 36:51.609
But, Jojo....

36:51.779 --> 36:54.373
-We haven't seen the gazelles.
-Or the crocodiles.

36:54.549 --> 36:58.576
Or the unicorns. Just one unic--

37:03.057 --> 37:06.493
Excuse me, ma'am.
I think you dropped this.

37:10.031 --> 37:13.364
I thought the zoo kept
all the animals in cages.

37:13.535 --> 37:15.696
Yeah, well, you're welcome, lady.

37:15.870 --> 37:17.531
Don't listen, Bubbles.

37:17.705 --> 37:20.503
That's right, Bubbles, do not listen.

37:20.675 --> 37:24.372
All of you, deafen yourselves
to their heartless words.

37:24.546 --> 37:28.539
They do not know it is their saviors
they are speaking to.

37:28.716 --> 37:33.585
They are unaware your actions will
have helped change their world forever.

37:35.256 --> 37:39.716
Because we have helped the town
and made it a better place.

37:39.894 --> 37:42.886
-You think they'll be surprised?.
-Oh, yeah.

37:43.064 --> 37:45.862
Will they still be mad at us
for playing tag?.

37:46.034 --> 37:49.731
No, they'll have forgotten
all about that.

37:49.904 --> 37:51.929
Will they love us?.

37:53.274 --> 37:54.366
Yes.

37:54.542 --> 37:58.603
-Really?.
-Would I lie to you?.

38:04.719 --> 38:07.187
-I'm so excited!
-We'll show them!

38:07.355 --> 38:08.947
Hey, where's--?.

38:10.558 --> 38:12.287
Professor!

38:12.627 --> 38:15.255
Girls, thank goodness you're okay.

38:15.430 --> 38:19.457
I'm so sorry.
I'm a terrible, terrible parent.

38:19.701 --> 38:24.001
You must hate me for not picking you
up from school, but it's not my fault.

38:24.172 --> 38:27.005
It's this town. They've gone crazy.

38:27.175 --> 38:30.372
It's like they've never seen kids
playing before.

38:30.545 --> 38:34.948
I knew your powers would take some
getting used to. But jail?. Lawsuits?.

38:35.116 --> 38:37.710
Angry mobs?. What's next?.

38:37.885 --> 38:42.322
Don't worry, Professor. Things are
gonna get better. We promise.

40:42.543 --> 40:44.477
-Today's the day.
-Today's the day!

40:44.645 --> 40:45.669
Today's the day!

40:45.847 --> 40:47.337
-Today's--
-The day.

40:47.515 --> 40:49.449
-What to wear?.
-What to wear?.

40:49.617 --> 40:50.641
That's nice.

41:11.239 --> 41:13.139
Professor, wake up! Wake up.

41:13.307 --> 41:15.832
-Wake--
-Up. Wake up, my brothers.

41:16.010 --> 41:18.945
-Wake up and seize the--
-Day!

41:19.113 --> 41:21.479
-The day?.
-Yeah, the day when we--

41:21.649 --> 41:26.677
Show Townsville just what
our powers can really do.

41:27.688 --> 41:28.677
What?.

41:28.856 --> 41:32.189
We're gonna show Townsville
just what our powers can really do.

41:32.360 --> 41:35.818
-We did something really good.
-That's gonna really--

41:35.997 --> 41:37.931
Help!

41:38.199 --> 41:40.292
Well, we met this guy.

41:40.468 --> 41:42.197
With powers like us.

41:42.370 --> 41:45.203
Who was also hated by everybody.

41:45.373 --> 41:48.308
But he had this great idea.

41:48.476 --> 41:50.808
To help the town.

41:50.978 --> 41:53.879
And make it a better place.

41:54.048 --> 41:57.677
-That way the town would accept us.
-We did something to help.

41:59.987 --> 42:02.455
So we used all our powers.

42:02.623 --> 42:04.716
And abilities.

42:04.926 --> 42:07.417
And his ideas.

42:07.595 --> 42:09.961
-To help everybody.
-City of Townsville...

42:10.131 --> 42:13.726
-It's gonna be so cool.
-...I'd like to take this moment...

42:13.901 --> 42:17.997
-You're gonna be so proud.
-...to thank the little people...

42:18.172 --> 42:19.730
Everyone's gonna love us.

42:19.907 --> 42:23.070
...who helped to make this day
a smashing success.

42:23.244 --> 42:25.678
We did really goo--

42:32.653 --> 42:37.613
Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup,
I couldn't have done it without you.

42:40.127 --> 42:43.096
-It's their fault!
-I knew they were no good!

42:45.066 --> 42:46.124
What happened?.

42:46.300 --> 42:48.734
This isn't making the town
a better place.

42:48.903 --> 42:53.465
Yes, it is, for me. The hobo
formerly known as "Jojo" is no more.

42:53.641 --> 42:56.371
From this day forward,
I shall be known as:

42:56.544 --> 42:59.570
Mojo Jojo!

43:02.817 --> 43:07.311
For too long, apes and monkeys
have been under the thumb of man.

43:07.488 --> 43:10.924
Well, the time has come
to oppose that thumb...

43:11.092 --> 43:14.858
...and take hold
of what is rightfully ours:

43:15.029 --> 43:17.020
The world!

43:17.198 --> 43:19.291
Professor, we didn't want this.

43:19.467 --> 43:20.729
-Liars.
-Fibbers.

43:20.902 --> 43:22.460
You've doomed us all.

43:22.637 --> 43:24.366
Please, Professor.

43:24.906 --> 43:27.136
Please believe us.

43:31.579 --> 43:33.604
I don't know who to believe.

43:35.750 --> 43:37.775
I thought you were good.

43:37.952 --> 43:39.476
No!

43:43.090 --> 43:45.422
Yeah! All right!

43:45.593 --> 43:46.685
I rock!

43:46.861 --> 43:48.886
I rock so hard.

43:49.130 --> 43:51.963
For l, Mojo Jojo, have succeeded...

43:52.133 --> 43:56.627
...in my first, greatest
and most brilliant plan ever.

43:56.837 --> 43:59.965
And l, Mojo Jojo, shall be...

44:00.408 --> 44:04.208
...king of the planet of the apes!

44:05.880 --> 44:08.849
You shall be king?. Preposterous.

44:09.016 --> 44:10.415
What?. How dare you.

44:10.585 --> 44:13.713
For it is I who is the one
most suited to be ruler.

44:13.888 --> 44:15.378
Those are my clothes.

44:15.556 --> 44:19.515
I, Ojo Tango, shall be simian supreme.

44:19.694 --> 44:21.355
No Ojo. Mojo.

44:21.529 --> 44:27.365
As I unleash the offensive omnipotence
of the oppressive Orango-tank.

44:27.535 --> 44:29.230
-Hold on.
-Oh, no!

44:29.403 --> 44:33.271
-I shall get a grip on the situation.
-You better not.

44:33.474 --> 44:37.968
As l, Rocko Socko,
seize control and rule.

44:38.312 --> 44:40.303
-Wait!
-l, Baboon Kaboom...

44:40.481 --> 44:44.178
...with my Baboom-bot,
will be the bomb.

44:45.119 --> 44:47.246
And if you don't like it...

44:47.755 --> 44:51.555
...you can sniff my Baboom-bot bombs.

44:52.493 --> 44:53.585
That's classy.

44:53.761 --> 44:56.161
Gangway! For we, the Gogo Po-Trol...

44:56.330 --> 45:00.323
...form a chain of command
that will take hold of your world.

45:00.501 --> 45:05.268
I, Hota Wata, am boiling mad,
for you are all wet behind the ears.

45:05.439 --> 45:09.739
So I shall unleash a scalding torrent
to drown you out, for I don't give a--

45:09.910 --> 45:10.899
Watch your mouth.

45:11.078 --> 45:16.015
I, Cha-Ching Cha-Ching,
symbolize chaotic calamity.

45:16.183 --> 45:21.917
We, the Doot Da Doot Da Doo Doos,
shall rain on your parade because...

45:22.089 --> 45:24.421
...we're the spit.

45:24.592 --> 45:27.527
My name is Hacha Chacha
And here is my schpiel

45:27.695 --> 45:30.357
A diabolical plan with lots of appeal

45:30.531 --> 45:33.295
Spreading out bananas far and wide

45:33.467 --> 45:36.561
And fixing up the folks
For a slippery slide

45:36.737 --> 45:37.863
Pretty catchy.

45:38.039 --> 45:42.738
I, Blah-Blah-Blah-Blah, shall create
a sauce of chaos and stir up trouble...

45:42.910 --> 45:45.572
...with a destructive force
known as the tormato.

45:45.746 --> 45:48.977
-Tormato?.
-Tormato.

45:51.218 --> 45:52.879
-l, Killa Drilla.
-l, Bonzo Bango.

45:53.054 --> 45:54.453
-l, Rolo Ovo.
-l, Cruncha Muncha.

45:54.622 --> 45:56.556
-l, Wacko Smacko.
-l, Pappy Whappy.

46:02.163 --> 46:04.495
No!

46:04.665 --> 46:09.102
Do not continue with your ramblings.
Mine are the ramblings to be obeyed.

46:09.270 --> 46:11.670
I am the king, supreme leader
and dictator.

46:11.839 --> 46:17.835
Your plans are my plans because you
made plans and my plan was to make you.

46:18.012 --> 46:21.573
I plan to rule the planet,
not to have my plans plan to stop me.

46:21.749 --> 46:25.207
I am your creator, I am your king.

46:25.386 --> 46:31.154
I am Mojo Jojo. Obey me!

47:16.871 --> 47:21.501
That jerk, that big, fat, dumb jerk.
He duped us.

47:21.675 --> 47:24.473
He planned it all along,
and we fell for it.

47:25.212 --> 47:30.878
And now, everybody hates us even more.

47:35.256 --> 47:37.224
What are you doing?.

47:37.391 --> 47:41.020
What does it look like I'm doing?.

47:41.195 --> 47:46.656
I'm building a house
because now we have to live here.

47:46.834 --> 47:49.860
-Live here?.
-Yeah, don't you see?.

47:50.037 --> 47:54.531
This can be the bedroom,
and this is my bed.

47:55.943 --> 47:58.707
That can be your bed over there.

47:58.879 --> 48:03.407
I don't wanna sleep on a rock!

48:08.189 --> 48:11.955
Maybe if someone hadn't pushed
Bubbles into the school....

48:12.693 --> 48:14.684
Look, she speaks.

48:14.862 --> 48:18.298
Maybe if somebody hadn't insisted
on walking home...

48:18.465 --> 48:22.333
...so we could run
into the biggest liar in the universe!

48:22.503 --> 48:25.995
We weren't allowed to use our powers,
and you know it!

48:26.173 --> 48:29.040
Look, it's Miss Goody-Goody.

48:29.210 --> 48:33.647
We weren't gonna get people
to stop hating us by breaking rules.

48:33.814 --> 48:36.282
Yeah. And using our super powers...

48:36.450 --> 48:39.908
...to make a Help-the-town-and-
make-it-a-better-place machine...

48:40.387 --> 48:42.582
...was following rules?.!

48:42.756 --> 48:46.692
-I didn't see you putting up a fight.
-Well, you're gonna now.

48:47.761 --> 48:51.788
If it weren't for you,
we wouldn't be in this stupid mess.

48:52.499 --> 48:54.467
You stupid!

49:10.484 --> 49:13.544
I'm not fighting with you, Buttercup.

49:13.721 --> 49:16.485
Because you know I'll kick your butt.

49:16.657 --> 49:20.423
No, because I know--
Never mind.

49:20.594 --> 49:24.724
I'm not fighting with you,
and I'm not talking to you ever!

49:25.366 --> 49:29.393
Well, prepare yourself
for a long silence, girl...

49:29.570 --> 49:34.234
...because we're gonna spend the rest
of our lives here, thanks to you.

49:34.408 --> 49:37.571
At least I got me a bed.

50:14.848 --> 50:17.510
Blossom?. Buttercup?.

50:18.886 --> 50:20.217
Do you hear that?.

50:23.290 --> 50:24.552
No!

50:24.725 --> 50:27.523
Blossom, what should we do?.

50:35.169 --> 50:39.196
Miss Goody-Goody'll say we should take
responsibility for our mistakes...

50:39.373 --> 50:43.867
-...and go help everybody.
-lt sounds like they're hurting.

50:44.044 --> 50:45.705
Who cares?.

50:51.085 --> 50:54.020
-What do we do?.
-Nothing.

51:13.807 --> 51:15.536
-Girls!
-Professor!

51:16.577 --> 51:19.774
Professor! Professor! Professor!

51:27.821 --> 51:29.413
Help!

51:30.057 --> 51:31.752
Bubbles, wait!

51:33.827 --> 51:37.558
-Good job, but we've gotta save--
-The baby!

51:39.533 --> 51:40.625
Holy....

51:42.636 --> 51:44.536
-Hey, what about--?.
-The dog!

51:52.746 --> 51:55.306
-You'll be safe now.
-Here you go, miss.

51:55.482 --> 51:58.178
-Thank you.
-Come on, Bubbles, let's--

51:59.520 --> 52:01.351
Save those people.

52:01.755 --> 52:04.053
Wait! This isn't my baby.

52:05.626 --> 52:07.059
Good dog.

52:08.896 --> 52:11.990
Can we find the Professor now, please?.

52:14.268 --> 52:15.496
Oh, man!

52:29.650 --> 52:31.242
Now stay!

52:42.729 --> 52:44.219
Doggone it!

53:00.147 --> 53:02.240
Okay. You should be safe here.

53:02.416 --> 53:04.008
This is hopeless!

53:04.184 --> 53:09.281
I know. There's too many monkeys.
What can we do?.

53:10.190 --> 53:14.490
Get your hands off him,
you darn dirty ape!

53:30.744 --> 53:35.181
I didn't mean it!
It was an accident!

53:35.349 --> 53:40.013
He wouldn't let go!
And the dog.

53:40.187 --> 53:44.715
That stupid dog,
and then the monkeys, and he--

53:44.892 --> 53:48.350
I couldn't-- He couldn't--
Oh, man!

53:48.529 --> 53:52.260
Buttercup!
You're a genius!

53:53.667 --> 53:55.794
-I am?.
-She is?.

53:55.969 --> 54:00.269
Yeah. The one way to stop the monkeys,
save the town and find the Professor...

54:00.440 --> 54:03.341
...is to use our powers to--

54:04.645 --> 54:06.704
Better yet, watch!

54:18.358 --> 54:21.191
-Wow!
-That was amaz-- Hey!

54:22.996 --> 54:25.226
Gross! Cut it out.

54:33.874 --> 54:38.402
Come on, girls. Let's put an end
to this gorilla warfare.

54:44.218 --> 54:46.277
Good one, Bubbles.

54:46.553 --> 54:49.317
-Girls--
-Shut up! I was afraid of this.

54:49.489 --> 54:53.619
They've returned and found out
what their powers can really do.

54:53.794 --> 54:58.060
Come. You will make
a good "Power-proof" vest.

56:39.566 --> 56:42.729
-None of those monkeys had Professor!
-Where could he be?.

56:42.903 --> 56:45.599
Take a good guess!

56:52.946 --> 56:57.349
Come on, girls! We've got
one last monkey to get off our backs!

57:01.421 --> 57:03.116
Not so fast...

57:03.290 --> 57:05.053
...Mojo Jojo!

57:05.225 --> 57:10.128
Look at the little heroes
here to save their daddy!

57:10.297 --> 57:12.322
No, girls! Save yourselves!

57:12.499 --> 57:16.060
-Sorry, Professor!
-We can take this chump chimp down!

57:16.236 --> 57:18.602
Nothing he can do can stop us!

57:19.239 --> 57:21.207
That's better.

57:21.708 --> 57:25.200
It's good you little freaks
know when you're beaten.

57:25.379 --> 57:29.713
Now if you'll excuse me, l, Mojo Jojo,
have a town to take over!

57:29.883 --> 57:33.375
I have a world to rule!
I have to seize control of an area...

57:33.553 --> 57:38.183
...and force its inhabitants
to follow my way of thinking!

57:47.801 --> 57:50.668
Even if it means...

57:50.837 --> 57:54.295
...taking extreme measures!

57:55.242 --> 57:57.335
-You wouldn't!
-I would!

58:21.401 --> 58:22.834
Professor!

58:31.411 --> 58:36.280
Now I am more Mojo than before!

58:51.965 --> 58:57.494
Now, as I was saying before
I was so rudely interrupted...

58:59.573 --> 59:03.100
...I, Mojo Jojo, have succeeded...

59:03.276 --> 59:09.738
...in my first, greatest
and most brilliant plan ever!

59:09.916 --> 59:14.216
And l, Mojo Jojo...

59:14.387 --> 59:17.845
...shall be king!

59:27.734 --> 59:32.330
Girls, thank goodness you're okay.
Now let's get out of this town!

59:32.506 --> 59:35.532
-It's no use.
-We already tried running away.

59:35.709 --> 59:38.075
We have to fix the problem
we helped start.

59:38.245 --> 59:41.612
You said to give everyone time
to understand our specialness.

59:41.781 --> 59:46.445
Well, now it's time for everyone
to understand. Especially Mojo!

59:59.466 --> 1:00:02.526
Surrender now,
and we'll go easy on you!

1:00:07.340 --> 1:00:09.535
Down here!

1:00:09.943 --> 1:00:14.607
Oh, my! You're actually
trying to stop me?.

1:00:14.781 --> 1:00:17.443
That's so cute!

1:00:17.617 --> 1:00:19.744
-Try, nothing!
-We will stop you!

1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:22.821
Who are you calling "cute"?.

1:00:25.625 --> 1:00:27.820
Okay, let's play!

1:00:43.176 --> 1:00:44.200
Buttercup!

1:01:04.898 --> 1:01:09.096
-Good job, girls!
-That more Mojo is no more!

1:01:15.942 --> 1:01:17.409
Girls!

1:01:39.666 --> 1:01:41.395
Somebody's mad.

1:01:45.238 --> 1:01:46.637
Look out!

1:01:57.283 --> 1:02:00.480
Oh, no, look!
Mojo's got Blossom pinned down!

1:02:00.654 --> 1:02:03.623
I have an idea. Come on!

1:02:12.532 --> 1:02:16.730
-Do you think he's finished?.
-No, but you are!

1:02:26.746 --> 1:02:31.240
Fools! You dare to challenge me?.

1:02:31.418 --> 1:02:33.978
Attempt to defeat me?.

1:02:34.154 --> 1:02:37.612
Try to destroy me?.!

1:02:37.791 --> 1:02:41.420
I, who saved you from certain death?.

1:02:41.594 --> 1:02:46.258
After all I've done for you,
you betray me?.

1:02:46.433 --> 1:02:49.425
And why?. For them?.

1:02:49.969 --> 1:02:53.268
The ones who hated you....

1:02:53.440 --> 1:02:56.034
Have forsaken you?.

1:02:57.877 --> 1:03:04.146
Can't you see?. None of them
will ever understand you as I can.

1:03:04.317 --> 1:03:10.586
For we are kindred spirits, whose
powers spring from the same source.

1:03:10.757 --> 1:03:15.490
So, girls, do not make me destroy you.

1:03:15.862 --> 1:03:20.196
For we are smarter, we are stronger!

1:03:20.400 --> 1:03:24.530
We are invincible!
We have the power!

1:03:24.704 --> 1:03:27.229
We are superior to them!

1:03:27.407 --> 1:03:31.468
And we shall rule!

1:03:33.246 --> 1:03:38.616
All we have to do is work together.

1:03:38.818 --> 1:03:42.549
Girls, join me.

1:03:52.532 --> 1:03:53.931
No!

1:03:56.736 --> 1:04:01.571
We'd never join you,
and it's because we are stronger.

1:04:02.108 --> 1:04:06.909
-Because we are invincible.
-Because we have the power!

1:04:07.080 --> 1:04:09.412
We have to protect them from you!

1:04:09.582 --> 1:04:13.678
-It's you who has to be feared.
-Because you are a monster!

1:04:13.853 --> 1:04:15.343
You are evil!

1:04:15.722 --> 1:04:18.350
And you are...

1:04:19.592 --> 1:04:21.492
...it!

1:04:23.363 --> 1:04:26.764
Curses!

1:04:28.868 --> 1:04:32.463
Girls, you were right!
We should stop Mojo, and I know how!

1:04:32.639 --> 1:04:37.042
I whipped up an antidote to Chemical X!
It'll do away with his powers!

1:04:58.565 --> 1:05:04.128
I'm so sorry for doubting you. You are
good little girls, and I love you!

1:05:04.304 --> 1:05:05.931
We love you too!

1:05:06.105 --> 1:05:09.336
-And we're really sorry.
-We messed up really bad.

1:05:09.509 --> 1:05:12.910
-But we're ready, Professor.
-Ready?.

1:05:13.079 --> 1:05:15.741
To take the Antidote X
to get rid of our powers.

1:05:15.915 --> 1:05:18.941
If it wasn't for them,
none of this would have happened.

1:05:19.118 --> 1:05:23.987
And maybe everyone would like us more
if we were just normal little girls.

1:05:24.157 --> 1:05:25.852
No!

1:05:30.463 --> 1:05:33.455
Don't do that...

1:05:33.633 --> 1:05:37.467
...because that was pretty cool,
with the....

1:05:37.670 --> 1:05:40.730
Girls, I think what the Mayor
is trying to say is...

1:05:40.907 --> 1:05:43.102
...we're sorry, and thank you.

1:05:43.276 --> 1:05:46.541
Yes, that was super, just super!

1:05:46.713 --> 1:05:49.204
-Amazing!
-Fantastic!

1:05:49.382 --> 1:05:51.816
-Wonderful!
-Stupendous!

1:05:51.985 --> 1:05:53.509
You rock!

1:05:53.920 --> 1:05:55.046
Thank you.

1:06:03.796 --> 1:06:07.197
That was awesome!
You were all flying and running!

1:06:07.367 --> 1:06:11.531
And then, laser eyes!
Then, bam!

1:06:11.738 --> 1:06:17.199
And then-- And then, bam,
you punched that guy! Remember?.

1:06:19.712 --> 1:06:25.309
Yeah, that was great.
You know, this town stinks.

1:06:25.518 --> 1:06:28.817
And I was wondering if,
maybe sometime...

1:06:28.988 --> 1:06:34.153
...we could, like, call you
to save the day or whatever.

1:06:34.327 --> 1:06:36.124
Can we, Professor?.

1:06:36.296 --> 1:06:40.323
Well, I don't know....

1:06:41.067 --> 1:06:44.525
Okay, but only if
it's before your bedtime.

1:07:01.854 --> 1:07:04.186
Help!

1:07:21.341 --> 1:07:24.868
Sugar, spice and everything nice.

1:07:25.378 --> 1:07:30.213
These were the ingredients chosen
to create the perfect little girl.

1:07:30.383 --> 1:07:34.945
But Professor Utonium accidentally
added an extra ingredient to the mix:

1:07:35.121 --> 1:07:36.452
Chemical X.

1:07:36.622 --> 1:07:41.116
Thus Blossom, Bubbles
and Buttercup were born!

1:07:41.294 --> 1:07:45.788
Using their ultra super powers,
they've dedicated their lives...

1:07:45.965 --> 1:07:50.061
...to fighting crime
and the forces of evil.

1:07:54.440 --> 1:08:00.709
And so for the very first time,
the day is saved, thanks to:

1:08:01.447 --> 1:08:03.506
The Powerpuff Girls!

1:08:03.683 --> 1:08:08.279
Hey, that's a good name for them.
Powerpuff Girls, yeah!

1:08:08.454 --> 1:08:12.686
I like that. Wonder if they will.
I'll run it by them.

1:08:12.859 --> 1:08:15.191
Powerpuff Girls!

1:13:34.380 --> 1:13:35.369
ENGLlSH

1:30:17.207 --> 1:30:21.166
What are these strange protrusions?.

1:30:21.378 --> 1:30:24.541
I must investigate immediately.

1:30:39.196 --> 1:30:42.324
Dee Dee, too much has happened
this morning, so please...

1:30:42.499 --> 1:30:44.967
...get out of my laboratory!

1:30:46.170 --> 1:30:48.536
I have no time for her foolishness.

1:30:49.139 --> 1:30:52.506
But, Dexter, I'm not in your labo--

1:31:00.017 --> 1:31:04.147
-You've got chickenpox!
-Chickenpox?.

1:31:04.321 --> 1:31:06.812
What is this "pox of a chicken"?.

1:31:07.491 --> 1:31:11.427
Poor Dexter.
So knowledgeable in science...

1:31:11.595 --> 1:31:17.033
...but doesn't have enough common
sense to know what chickenpox is.

1:31:18.068 --> 1:31:21.162
Well, a long time ago...

1:31:21.805 --> 1:31:26.936
...a group of evil, contaminated
chickens escaped from jail...

1:31:28.612 --> 1:31:32.605
...and started to break
into children's houses...

1:31:32.783 --> 1:31:36.446
...where they pecked away,
leaving huge, itchy pimples!

1:31:37.421 --> 1:31:42.586
And if you scratch them, you'll turn
into an evil, contaminated chicken!

1:31:43.827 --> 1:31:46.227
Are you crazy, woman?.!

1:31:54.438 --> 1:31:58.397
I do not want to be an evil,
contaminated chicken!

1:31:58.575 --> 1:32:00.702
Then don't scratch!

1:32:03.080 --> 1:32:06.516
That seems simple enough.

1:32:08.419 --> 1:32:12.082
I better keep myself busy,
so as not to think about the itching.

1:32:15.626 --> 1:32:16.923
Perfect!

1:32:17.094 --> 1:32:21.497
Now, how much
dioxide detrolium should I add?.

1:32:21.665 --> 1:32:24.862
What is the correct amount?.

1:32:28.539 --> 1:32:33.101
Silly me, have I been scratching
this whole time?.

1:32:36.080 --> 1:32:37.980
Robot!

1:32:38.148 --> 1:32:40.708
More drastic measures must be taken.

1:32:40.884 --> 1:32:41.942
Yes, Dexter?.

1:32:42.119 --> 1:32:45.282
If you see me scratch
any part of my body...

1:32:45.456 --> 1:32:48.323
...zap me with 1 00 watts of electrons.

1:32:48.492 --> 1:32:50.551
Yes, Dexter.

1:32:52.463 --> 1:32:56.456
-I wasn't ready, Robot.
-Yes, Dexter.

1:32:58.802 --> 1:33:03.136
-I said, I wasn't ready.
-Yes, Dexter.

1:33:03.974 --> 1:33:06.272
No, Robot, wait!

1:33:07.744 --> 1:33:09.336
This is not working.

1:33:09.613 --> 1:33:11.547
Stop, Robot!

1:33:12.916 --> 1:33:15.851
A new invention must be created.

1:33:32.402 --> 1:33:34.597
Success!

1:34:20.784 --> 1:34:23.446
Got to scratch!

1:34:29.726 --> 1:34:32.092
Oh, yeah!

1:35:08.165 --> 1:35:09.723
Hello!

1:35:13.503 --> 1:35:15.562
Dexter, is that you?.

1:35:16.773 --> 1:35:19.640
Yeah. I scratched.
