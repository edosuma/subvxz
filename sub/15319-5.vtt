09:57.314 --> 09:58.413
with his fingerprints on it?

09:58.415 --> 10:00.816
He's hiding something.

10:00.818 --> 10:03.418
He needs our help,
but he's too stubborn to ask.

10:03.420 --> 10:04.919
I did not get that.

10:04.921 --> 10:06.921
I've known him
for over a hundred years.

10:06.923 --> 10:09.090
He only acts this way
when he's really rattled.

10:09.092 --> 10:11.325
No, something's going on here,
and whatever it is, it's big.

10:13.094 --> 10:13.960
[Gasping in panic]

10:13.962 --> 10:15.796
It's happening again.

10:15.798 --> 10:16.997
Run. Run!

10:20.102 --> 10:21.502
Come on, we can't stay here.

10:21.504 --> 10:23.037
Wait a second,
<i>what</i> is happening again?

10:23.039 --> 10:23.872
We gotta go.

10:23.874 --> 10:24.973
Now!

10:24.975 --> 10:25.807
[Energy pulsing]

10:33.437 --> 10:34.604
Stop!

10:34.606 --> 10:35.972
It's too late.

10:38.643 --> 10:41.277
What the hell
was that thing?

10:43.491 --> 10:46.259
Evacuate the outer sections
and lock down the facility.

10:46.974 --> 10:49.107
How dare you?

10:49.109 --> 10:50.175
It's all right.

10:50.177 --> 10:51.910
What are you
talking about?

10:51.912 --> 10:52.744
That thing out there.

10:52.746 --> 10:53.579
You saw it?

10:53.581 --> 10:54.480
Not clearly,

10:54.482 --> 10:55.448
but it killed
one of your guards

10:55.450 --> 10:56.316
right in front of me.

10:56.318 --> 10:57.150
[Sighs heavily]

10:57.152 --> 10:58.418
So, what is it?

10:58.420 --> 11:01.054
Some sort of experimental
genetic hybrid?

11:01.056 --> 11:03.356
Dreamed up
by a war-mongering bureaucrat

11:03.358 --> 11:04.224
and assembled by your team

11:04.226 --> 11:06.126
of modern-day
Dr. Frankensteins?

11:06.128 --> 11:07.428
Just stop.

11:07.430 --> 11:08.295
I had nothing to do
with that creature.

11:08.297 --> 11:09.196
Oh, really?

11:09.198 --> 11:10.598
So it's just a coincidence

11:10.600 --> 11:12.000
that it's roaming the halls

11:12.002 --> 11:13.634
of your genetic
testing facility.

11:13.636 --> 11:14.969
Whatever it is,

11:14.971 --> 11:16.570
it's naturally occurring,
I swear.

11:16.572 --> 11:18.305
It showed up
about 12 hours ago,

11:18.307 --> 11:21.308
attacked a cleaning lady,
and then disappeared again.

11:21.310 --> 11:22.542
What do you mean,
it just disappeared?

11:22.544 --> 11:25.045
It vanished. It evanesced.
It went "poof".

11:25.047 --> 11:27.079
That's impossible.

11:27.081 --> 11:28.114
Well, we searched
the entire building,

11:28.116 --> 11:29.014
we've done
secondary scans

11:29.016 --> 11:30.115
for heat, movement,

11:30.117 --> 11:31.316
oogly-googly-ness,

11:31.318 --> 11:32.751
and there's nothing,
not a trace.

11:32.753 --> 11:34.320
So why didn't you
call for help?

11:34.322 --> 11:36.389
For what?

11:36.391 --> 11:38.357
For some non-existent creature
that I can't describe?

11:38.359 --> 11:39.659
And besides,
who would I call, you?

11:39.661 --> 11:41.594
You seem
to have forgotten

11:41.596 --> 11:44.031
you're not exactly on everyone's
speed-dial anymore.

11:44.033 --> 11:45.665
Well, I'm here now,

11:45.667 --> 11:47.467
and I suggest
that we find that thing

11:47.469 --> 11:49.303
before it does any more damage.

11:49.305 --> 11:51.305
You know, cooperating with
you is a federal offence.

11:51.307 --> 11:53.708
Okay, would you
rather we left?

11:55.611 --> 11:56.644
Right this way, please.

11:59.614 --> 12:01.482
Thank you.

12:07.622 --> 12:09.323
[Elevator dings]

12:09.325 --> 12:11.591
[Will sighs wearily]

12:13.060 --> 12:14.527
[Clattering]

12:32.213 --> 12:33.880
Aah!

12:33.882 --> 12:34.714
[Roaring]

12:36.117 --> 12:37.350
Don't.

12:37.352 --> 12:39.251
Stop doing that.

12:39.253 --> 12:40.319
Sorry, he startled me.

12:40.321 --> 12:42.187
Who is this?

12:42.189 --> 12:43.489
Name's Galvo.

12:43.491 --> 12:46.658
Actually, it's Galvofestichius,
but I usually go by...

12:46.660 --> 12:48.693
[Belches hugely]

12:48.695 --> 12:51.128
Oh, man,
that one tasted.

12:51.130 --> 12:53.464
He tracked me down
in Old City.

12:53.466 --> 12:55.599
Needs a lift
back to Hollow Earth.

12:55.601 --> 12:57.836
Yeah, I heard you're
running folks down there.

12:57.838 --> 12:59.137
I gotta get in on that.

12:59.139 --> 13:01.340
Yeah, well,
good luck with that.

13:01.342 --> 13:02.708
We just got busted.

13:02.710 --> 13:03.710
What happened?

13:03.712 --> 13:05.144
I thought we
cleared passage.

13:05.146 --> 13:06.613
Apparently,

13:06.615 --> 13:07.614
somebody tipped off
the Chilean authorities.

13:07.616 --> 13:09.617
We got intercepted
in Valparaiso.

13:09.619 --> 13:11.819
They took
the abnormals,

13:11.821 --> 13:13.321
held me for nine hours,

13:13.323 --> 13:14.856
and then put me on a military
transport back to Santiago,

13:14.858 --> 13:16.691
where I had to catch
another flight back home.

13:16.693 --> 13:18.493
And the abnormals?

13:20.796 --> 13:22.697
But you're going back
again, right?

13:22.699 --> 13:24.632
I gotta get
down there.

13:24.634 --> 13:26.234
I can't take it up here anymore.

13:26.236 --> 13:27.301
Every time we turn around,

13:27.303 --> 13:28.836
somebody's
grabbing you.

13:28.838 --> 13:32.507
That, and the food
really disagrees with me.

13:32.509 --> 13:33.708
[Belching hugely]

13:33.710 --> 13:35.810
Ugh...

13:45.656 --> 13:46.623
What is it about you and me

13:46.625 --> 13:48.391
and dark, narrow corridors?

13:48.393 --> 13:50.294
You know, it does seem
to be a recurring theme,

13:50.296 --> 13:51.495
doesn't it?

13:51.497 --> 13:53.631
Hey, what do you say
we ditch the kid

13:53.633 --> 13:56.433
and find an intimate
supply closet somewhere?

the deadly creature

13:58.904 --> 14:00.771

terrorizing your staff

14:00.773 --> 14:02.171
before it decides
to strike again?

14:02.173 --> 14:04.173
Yeah, that too.

14:25.496 --> 14:26.695
Uh, Dr. Coates.

14:26.697 --> 14:28.697
I was so
scared for you.

14:28.699 --> 14:29.598
They said
you ran away,

14:29.600 --> 14:30.732
but I knew you'd come back.

14:30.734 --> 14:31.566
[Scoffs]
Run away.

14:31.568 --> 14:32.467
No, I didn't...

14:32.469 --> 14:33.902
What are you doing here?

14:33.904 --> 14:35.570
Well, the lights were
going out in our section,

14:35.572 --> 14:37.806
so we ran in here to hide.

14:37.808 --> 14:39.740
All right, everyone stay put.
Let's go.

14:39.742 --> 14:41.776
Well, maybe I should--

14:41.778 --> 14:44.178
Now, Nikola.

14:58.493 --> 14:59.560
Fire!

15:05.900 --> 15:07.768
What the hell was that thing?

15:09.270 --> 15:10.371
It seemed to be using

15:10.373 --> 15:12.539
some sort of inter-dimensional
event horizon.

15:12.541 --> 15:14.408
That would explain
the appearing and disappearing.

15:14.410 --> 15:16.609
But how is that possible?

15:16.611 --> 15:19.312
In order for it to move
through space-time,

15:19.314 --> 15:21.348
somebody would have had...

15:21.350 --> 15:24.217
[Tesla sighs]

15:24.219 --> 15:25.986
Nikola?

15:25.988 --> 15:27.621
Dude, what did you do?

15:27.623 --> 15:28.955
Well, about my work here,

15:28.957 --> 15:31.491
I, uh...

15:31.493 --> 15:33.460
I may not have been
entirely candid with you.

15:41.545 --> 15:42.353
Out with it.

15:42.354 --> 15:43.420
All right.

15:50.260 --> 15:51.560
I may be partly responsible

15:51.562 --> 15:52.828
for the appearance
of that creature.

15:52.830 --> 15:54.463
You don't say.

15:54.465 --> 15:55.698
Bear in mind

15:55.700 --> 15:57.133
that when first approached
about this job,

15:57.135 --> 15:58.167
I did turn it down.

15:58.169 --> 15:59.102
What's your point?

15:59.104 --> 16:00.604
My point is

16:00.606 --> 16:03.841
that the fear of abnormals
is so pervasive in Washington

16:03.843 --> 16:05.376
that when they came back
a second time,

16:05.378 --> 16:07.178
they basically offered me
a blank check

16:07.180 --> 16:08.446
to fix the problem.

16:08.448 --> 16:09.881
Anything I needed
to get the job done,

16:09.883 --> 16:11.182
no questions asked.

16:11.184 --> 16:13.185
I see, and you saw
an opportunity.

16:13.187 --> 16:14.620
How could I
pass it up?

16:14.622 --> 16:15.454
Pass what up?

16:15.456 --> 16:16.989
What's going on?

16:16.991 --> 16:18.857
He used the government money
to fund his own research.

16:18.859 --> 16:21.226
Skimmed off the top.

16:21.228 --> 16:23.529
Yeah, and off the middle,

16:23.531 --> 16:25.363
and a little bit
off the bottom, too.

16:25.365 --> 16:26.298
Dude--

16:26.300 --> 16:27.132
Oh, please.

16:27.134 --> 16:28.567
I'm stealing from the department

16:28.569 --> 16:30.302
that's funding an assault
on what you do.

16:30.304 --> 16:31.537
You should be thanking me.

16:31.539 --> 16:33.538
Oh, yes, you're our own
personal Robin Hood.

16:34.907 --> 16:37.943
So what exactly
are you working on?

16:40.413 --> 16:41.247
Nikola?

16:53.894 --> 16:57.430
[Tesla]: Behold
your tax dollars at work.

17:04.939 --> 17:06.204
[Hydraulics whir]

17:20.387 --> 17:21.252
That's a rift node.

17:22.722 --> 17:24.589
[Tesla]:
It's Adam's design.

17:24.592 --> 17:26.858
With <i> significant</i>
<i>improvements,</i>

17:26.861 --> 17:28.093
of course.

17:28.095 --> 17:30.596
What is
all this for?

17:30.598 --> 17:32.197
Power.

17:32.199 --> 17:34.666
As much as you need,
whenever you need it.

17:34.668 --> 17:37.569
You're drawing energy
from the rift.

17:37.571 --> 17:39.303
The node creates
a stable rift field

17:39.305 --> 17:41.306
roughly half the size
of this facility.

17:41.308 --> 17:42.740
I can tap into it
whenever I want.

17:42.742 --> 17:44.141
Picture it--

17:44.143 --> 17:47.978
unlimited clean energy
right beneath our fingertips.

17:47.980 --> 17:49.646
No more wars on oil,

17:49.648 --> 17:51.715
no more nuclear meltdowns,

17:51.717 --> 17:55.352
no more insufferable celebrities
telling us to "go green",

17:55.354 --> 17:57.388
and all because of
the genius of one man.

17:57.390 --> 17:58.756
Adam Worth.

17:58.758 --> 18:00.658
Mock if you will,
but you know very well

18:00.660 --> 18:03.495
this is the culmination
of my life's work.

18:03.497 --> 18:06.865
Ever since Edison stole my ideas
over a hundred years ago,

18:06.867 --> 18:08.234
I've been searching for a way

18:08.236 --> 18:09.835
to destroy
that Menlo Park windbag,

18:09.837 --> 18:12.605
and now I finally
I have it.

18:12.607 --> 18:14.874
12 hours ago, I ran a test.

18:14.876 --> 18:16.842
I was able to draw
enough energy

18:16.844 --> 18:19.612
to power the island
of Manhattan for a week.

18:19.614 --> 18:20.980
Did you say
12 hours ago?

18:20.982 --> 18:23.482
Yes, I know
what you're thinking.

18:23.484 --> 18:24.349
It roughly coincides

18:24.351 --> 18:26.318
with the appearance

18:26.320 --> 18:28.386
of our multi-tentacled
friend, I admit it.

18:28.388 --> 18:29.520
I'd say it's more

18:29.522 --> 18:31.589
than a rough
coincidence, Nikola.

18:31.591 --> 18:34.391
If that creature
is indeed from the rift,

18:34.393 --> 18:35.826
then your node

18:35.828 --> 18:37.895
could be interfering
with its habitat somehow,

18:37.897 --> 18:40.398
allowing it,
or even causing it,

18:40.400 --> 18:42.367
to hunt in
our physical reality.

18:42.369 --> 18:45.404
You need to shut it down.

18:45.406 --> 18:46.772
Are you crazy?

18:46.774 --> 18:48.807
It's taken me months
to stabilize the field.

18:48.809 --> 18:50.242
So what,

18:50.244 --> 18:51.443
you're just gonna let that thing
keep attacking people?

18:51.445 --> 18:53.378
Listen, if a rat
gets loose in my house,

18:53.380 --> 18:55.514
I don't destroy the house,
I kill the rat.

18:55.516 --> 18:57.349
I'm not asking you
to blow it up,

18:57.351 --> 18:58.584
I'm just saying turn it off.

18:58.586 --> 18:59.719
I can't.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.721
That's the beauty
of this system.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.356
Once the field is stabilized,

19:03.358 --> 19:05.792
the node draws energy
from the rift to maintain it.

19:05.794 --> 19:06.660
It's self-sustaining.

19:06.662 --> 19:07.694
Well, luckily,

19:07.696 --> 19:09.730
I've brought the world's
foremost expert

19:09.732 --> 19:12.499
in taking
things apart.

19:12.501 --> 19:13.533
Henry?

19:13.535 --> 19:14.534
I'm on it.

19:14.536 --> 19:16.036
Are you kidding me? Him?

19:16.038 --> 19:17.970
No--
wait, don't touch that!

19:17.972 --> 19:18.804
Just hold on.

19:20.006 --> 19:20.973
All right, fine.

19:20.975 --> 19:22.340
I'll find a way
to shut it down.

19:22.342 --> 19:24.375
Just tell furriest George

19:24.377 --> 19:26.010
to keep his hands
in his pockets.

19:26.012 --> 19:27.311
In the meantime,

19:27.313 --> 19:28.579
I'm going to search

19:28.581 --> 19:29.747
for the surviving
members of your staff--

19:29.749 --> 19:30.948
or should I say
<i>future</i> members

19:30.950 --> 19:32.616
of the class action suit
against you,

19:32.618 --> 19:34.886
help them
find a way out of here.

19:34.888 --> 19:36.788
Keep me posted,
Henry.

19:39.826 --> 19:42.394
Every time she shows up.

19:42.396 --> 19:44.530
Hey, you got a lot of
cool stuff down here,

19:44.532 --> 19:45.365
you know that?

19:45.367 --> 19:46.232
Yeah.

19:46.234 --> 19:47.367
We used to have
this swap meet

19:47.369 --> 19:48.835
every six days in
our section of the tunnel.

19:48.837 --> 19:50.470
You could make
some serious trades

19:50.472 --> 19:51.538
with this stuff.

19:51.540 --> 19:52.939
Hey! What do you
call this?

19:52.941 --> 19:54.474
That's a vase.
Yeah.

19:54.476 --> 19:55.775
And what about this?

19:55.777 --> 19:57.777
Also a vase.

19:57.779 --> 19:59.011
And this?

19:59.013 --> 20:01.414
They're all vases, hmm?

20:01.416 --> 20:02.381
Huh.

20:02.383 --> 20:03.783
Speaking of vases,

20:03.785 --> 20:05.751
I might have dropped something
in that big white one

20:05.753 --> 20:06.952
downstairs.

20:06.954 --> 20:07.786
You know the one
with the handle

20:07.788 --> 20:09.554
that makes
the water swirl?

20:09.556 --> 20:10.688
It spilled everywhere.

20:10.690 --> 20:12.823
Could you
do me a favor?

20:12.825 --> 20:14.091
Sure!

20:14.093 --> 20:17.761
I need something
in there.

20:17.763 --> 20:19.363
Just, uh,
towards the back.

20:19.365 --> 20:20.531
Don't be afraid
of the dark.

20:20.533 --> 20:21.666
Keep going,
right in the back.

20:21.668 --> 20:22.833
You see it?

20:22.835 --> 20:24.101
That'll do it.

20:24.103 --> 20:25.403
Hey.

20:25.405 --> 20:27.405
Where's, uh, Galvo?

20:27.407 --> 20:28.840
I don't know--

20:28.842 --> 20:29.674
[Galvo]: Hey, guys,
it's pretty dark in here.

20:29.676 --> 20:31.909
[Knob rattles]

20:31.911 --> 20:33.812
I think there's something
wrong with the door.

20:33.814 --> 20:36.881
We need to get rid of this guy.

20:36.883 --> 20:38.483
We can't arrange
another trip to Hollow Earth

20:38.485 --> 20:39.484
until we have a bigger group.

20:39.486 --> 20:41.586
It takes weeks
to arrange transport

20:41.588 --> 20:43.021
and bribe
the necessary officials,

20:43.023 --> 20:44.723
and that's assuming we find
another new gateway

20:44.725 --> 20:45.623
now that Chile's
off the map.

20:45.625 --> 20:46.557
I won't last that long.

20:46.559 --> 20:47.458
I know.

20:47.460 --> 20:48.626
[Belch]

20:49.962 --> 20:51.864
[Sighs]
You'd better...

20:55.768 --> 20:56.935
Oh...

20:56.937 --> 20:59.471
Close one.

20:59.473 --> 21:01.407
Hey, if you guys
are looking for abnormals,

21:01.409 --> 21:02.542
why didn't you just say so?

21:04.879 --> 21:06.880
Oh, good hearing
runs in my family.

21:06.882 --> 21:09.917
Dates back to when my great,
great, great Uncle Dorfa--

21:09.919 --> 21:11.585
short for Dorfafestichius--

21:11.587 --> 21:12.753
was a sheepherder

21:12.755 --> 21:14.921
back in the early
part of the century.

21:14.923 --> 21:15.989
The thing about the abnormals,

21:15.991 --> 21:17.924
let's... go back to that.

21:17.926 --> 21:19.626
Oh, yeah.

21:19.628 --> 21:20.693
I used to hang with

21:20.695 --> 21:21.861
this group of
Hollow Earth abnormals

21:21.863 --> 21:23.196
that went by the name
"Chalkstone."

21:23.198 --> 21:25.531
I think it was because of
the mineral deposits

21:25.533 --> 21:26.766
in their section
of the tunnels.

21:26.768 --> 21:27.733
Probably.

21:27.735 --> 21:29.868
Anyway,
we got separated.

21:29.870 --> 21:30.903
They sent me out for food,

21:30.905 --> 21:33.439
and when I came back,
they were gone.

21:33.441 --> 21:34.540
I can't imagine why.

21:34.542 --> 21:36.742
I looked everywhere,

21:36.744 --> 21:38.211
but I never
caught up with them.

21:38.213 --> 21:41.515
Maybe you guys
could track them down?

21:41.517 --> 21:42.950
Hey, it would get me
out of your hair a lot sooner.

21:44.753 --> 21:46.854
Call everyone you know.

21:46.856 --> 21:50.124
Call in favors,
do anything.

21:50.126 --> 21:52.193
He likes me.

22:02.203 --> 22:03.570
Dude, it's simple.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.939
Introduce a Xenon wash
to flood the Cerrelium core.

22:05.941 --> 22:06.973
That'll shut it down.

22:06.975 --> 22:08.508
Yes, and unleash
a massive dose

22:08.510 --> 22:09.976
of gamma radiation
along with it.

22:09.978 --> 22:11.610
I hope you're not planning
on having children.

22:11.612 --> 22:14.213
Uh, I am, actually.

22:16.050 --> 22:18.051
My girlfriend and I
are expecting.

22:18.053 --> 22:19.286
You're kidding.

22:19.288 --> 22:22.223
Nope. She's due sometime
in the next year and a half.

22:23.492 --> 22:25.960
It's complicated.

22:25.962 --> 22:27.495
Wow. Well,

22:27.497 --> 22:29.497
that's the eighth sign
of the apocalypse.

22:30.833 --> 22:33.001
You can be a real jerk,
you know that?

22:33.003 --> 22:34.235
Well, I'm sorry that
I'm not more impressed

22:34.237 --> 22:35.937
about your ability
to sow your seed.

22:35.939 --> 22:37.838
No, you know what,
it's not just that.

22:37.840 --> 22:39.106
It's everything.

22:39.108 --> 22:41.075
You're working for
Magnus' enemies

22:41.077 --> 22:42.676
after everything
she's done for you.

22:42.678 --> 22:44.244
That's not cool, dude.

22:44.246 --> 22:45.278
Would you rather
I left the position vacant

22:45.280 --> 22:46.713
for somebody else to fill it?

22:46.715 --> 22:47.780
I don't know,

22:47.782 --> 22:48.982
General Villanova,
perhaps?

22:48.984 --> 22:49.949
Oh, come on, it's blood money,

22:49.951 --> 22:51.184
and you know it.

22:51.186 --> 22:52.618
Listen, I'm not
experimenting on abnormals,

22:52.620 --> 22:54.120
and nor do I intend to,

22:54.122 --> 22:55.287
and by the time

22:55.289 --> 22:56.756
those dunderheads
in Washington find out,

22:56.758 --> 22:58.625
I'll be on my own
private island.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.260
I hope you're happy there,

23:00.262 --> 23:02.696
'cause you'll be all alone.

23:02.698 --> 23:06.233
You just betrayed
the best friend you ever had.

23:11.640 --> 23:12.907
Your idea,

23:12.909 --> 23:14.075
about flooding
the Cerrelium core.

23:14.077 --> 23:15.811
It could work.

23:15.813 --> 23:17.680
I know.

23:19.316 --> 23:23.686
And the whole
kid thing...

23:23.688 --> 23:24.955
Mazel tov.

23:30.095 --> 23:31.362
You and Nikki,

23:31.364 --> 23:33.096
you've known each other
for a long time?

23:33.098 --> 23:34.231
Yeah, you could
say that.

23:34.233 --> 23:35.999
He talks
about you a lot,

23:36.001 --> 23:37.233
all the adventures
you've had together.

23:37.235 --> 23:38.902
They sound incredible.

23:38.904 --> 23:40.770
I'm sure
he's exaggerating.

23:40.772 --> 23:41.905
You shouldn't
be mad at him.

23:41.907 --> 23:44.173
He's really an amazing man.

23:44.175 --> 23:45.841
Run!

23:45.843 --> 23:47.009
Henry, the creature's back!

23:47.011 --> 23:48.277
You need to
shut down that field!

23:48.279 --> 23:50.245
Uh, we're not there yet, Doc.

23:50.247 --> 23:51.847
Well, get there!

23:51.849 --> 23:52.948
Now!

23:52.950 --> 23:54.917
Out of my way.
You're taking too long.

23:54.919 --> 23:56.185
Dude, would you--
you're going to overload--

23:56.187 --> 23:57.654
quit distracting me.

24:04.028 --> 24:06.630
[Beeping in code]

24:06.632 --> 24:07.998
[Door beeps in error]

24:08.000 --> 24:09.767
I can't open it!

24:09.769 --> 24:12.303
[Magnus]:
Anytime, Henry.

24:12.305 --> 24:13.771
[Hits enter]

24:13.773 --> 24:15.973
[Power whining down]

24:15.975 --> 24:17.708
There.

24:17.710 --> 24:18.876
Nice.

24:18.878 --> 24:20.210
The field's collapsing.

24:24.782 --> 24:26.015
[Stunner blasting]

24:37.059 --> 24:38.226
Well done. You did it.

24:38.228 --> 24:40.027
Uh...

24:40.029 --> 24:41.796
Yeah, no, we didn't.

24:41.798 --> 24:43.698
What are you talking about?

24:43.700 --> 24:45.767
The rift field's
coming back online.

24:45.769 --> 24:46.968
That's impossible.

24:46.970 --> 24:48.170
I shut down
the node entirely.

24:48.172 --> 24:49.137
I don't know what
to tell you, dude.

24:49.139 --> 24:50.672
It's powering itself
without the node.

24:50.674 --> 24:52.708
Not only that,
but it's growing.

24:52.710 --> 24:54.209
Incredible.

24:54.211 --> 24:55.577
Do you know what this means?

24:55.579 --> 24:57.379
<i>It means that</i>
<i>the creature's hunting ground</i>

24:57.381 --> 24:59.014
<i>is growing along with it.</i>

24:59.016 --> 25:00.782
It won't be long
before it extends

25:00.784 --> 25:01.783
<i>beyond the facility.</i>

25:01.785 --> 25:03.318
Yes, yes, yes,
but more importantly,

25:03.320 --> 25:04.252
I did it.

25:06.788 --> 25:09.823
I invented
wireless electricity.

25:21.176 --> 25:22.176
Hey.

25:22.407 --> 25:23.773
Scientists get out okay?

25:23.775 --> 25:24.941
Yeah, they're
all safe.

25:24.943 --> 25:25.875
What's the status
of the rift?

25:25.877 --> 25:27.878
Still growing.

25:27.880 --> 25:29.079
At the rate it's going,

25:29.081 --> 25:30.547
it'll reach Alamogordo
by morning.

25:30.549 --> 25:32.549
That would be
a horrible country song.

25:32.551 --> 25:34.250
And him?

25:34.252 --> 25:35.585
Him?

25:35.587 --> 25:37.520
Oh, he's working on
his Nobel speech.

25:37.522 --> 25:38.955
Wants to call
his invention

25:38.957 --> 25:40.390
"Tesla-tricity".

25:40.392 --> 25:41.491
Blimey.

25:42.926 --> 25:44.360
I know what you're
going to say, Helen.

25:44.362 --> 25:46.495
But we simply can't
shut down the rift

25:46.497 --> 25:47.997
until I know more
about how it works.

25:47.999 --> 25:49.465
Be reasonable, Nikola.

25:49.467 --> 25:51.767
If that creature gets loose
in a populated area--

25:51.769 --> 25:53.402
am I the only one
who recognizes

25:53.404 --> 25:54.870
the potential
of this technology?

25:54.872 --> 25:56.839
It could revolutionize
the world.

25:56.841 --> 25:58.641
End poverty,
starvation--

25:58.643 --> 25:59.642
lives.

25:59.644 --> 26:01.577
Every advancement in history

26:01.579 --> 26:02.945
has had some kind of human toll.

26:04.514 --> 26:06.682
So, what number
are you thinking?

26:06.684 --> 26:07.750
50?

26:07.752 --> 26:09.318
50,000?

26:09.320 --> 26:10.786
Look, for all we know,

26:10.788 --> 26:12.287
there could be more
of those creatures,

26:12.289 --> 26:13.788
and as the field expands,
it could draw them out.

26:13.790 --> 26:15.657
You're speculating.

26:15.659 --> 26:18.826
It doesn't belong here, Nikola,

26:18.828 --> 26:20.628
and if we're not careful,

26:20.630 --> 26:23.063
we'll lose control
of the situation entirely.

26:23.065 --> 26:25.531
I'm sorry,
but we have no choice.

26:33.375 --> 26:34.675
Where's Galvo?

26:34.677 --> 26:38.379
[Pounding on door]
Help me!

26:38.381 --> 26:39.748
[Knob rattling]

26:39.750 --> 26:42.451
[Pounding urgently]

26:42.453 --> 26:43.919
Hello?

26:54.330 --> 26:55.630
This guy's nuts.

26:55.632 --> 26:57.799
You can't leave me here
alone with him again.

26:57.801 --> 26:58.900
I won't have to.

26:58.902 --> 27:00.702
I found the Chalkstone group.

27:00.704 --> 27:02.703
You did? Where?

27:02.705 --> 27:04.472
They're meeting us
at St. Michael's Church

27:04.474 --> 27:05.673
in the Fifth Ward.

27:05.675 --> 27:07.207
Oh, that's great.

27:07.209 --> 27:09.409
So, we get them back here,
we can plan the next steps.

27:09.411 --> 27:10.710
Head to Hollow Earth, right?

27:10.712 --> 27:12.912
Let's just take it
one thing at a time.

27:12.914 --> 27:14.580
We should go.

27:14.582 --> 27:15.481
Yeah.

27:19.519 --> 27:21.787
[Sighing wearily]

27:21.789 --> 27:24.391
What I wouldn't do
for a glass of fine red.

27:24.393 --> 27:25.859
Well, I'm sure
there's another bottle

27:25.861 --> 27:27.694
of '95 Margaux
in your office.

27:27.696 --> 27:30.764
Just a short skip across
the feeding ground.

27:30.766 --> 27:32.432
Still sore at me, I see.

27:32.434 --> 27:34.534
Do you blame me?

27:34.536 --> 27:38.471
You know, this could have been
a banner year for you.

27:38.473 --> 27:39.772
In the current climate,

27:39.774 --> 27:41.440
a woman with
your expertise,

27:41.442 --> 27:43.442
not to mention
arresting good looks,

27:43.444 --> 27:46.712
you would have been
in high demand,

27:46.714 --> 27:48.747
but you chose to cut yourself
off from the world.

27:48.749 --> 27:50.916
Oh, silly me.

27:50.918 --> 27:52.618
Missing the chance

27:52.620 --> 27:53.919
to play patsy
to a government gone mad.

27:53.921 --> 27:56.054
Please, get over yourself.

27:56.056 --> 27:57.489
You know very well

27:57.491 --> 27:58.391
these directives
change like the weather.

27:58.393 --> 27:59.525
And besides,

27:59.527 --> 28:01.594
there's more than
one way to skin a system.

28:01.596 --> 28:03.964
You chose to fight
from the outside.

28:03.966 --> 28:06.066
I choose to fight
from within.

28:06.068 --> 28:08.836
Oh. Oh, is that
what you're doing?

28:08.838 --> 28:11.405
Right, and the abnormals
under your care,

28:11.407 --> 28:12.606
are they in on it, too?

28:12.608 --> 28:15.977
Tell me, what happens

28:15.979 --> 28:17.345
when the government
realizes

28:17.347 --> 28:19.580
that their research into
abnormal-based weaponry

28:19.582 --> 28:20.982
has fallen behind
under your watch?

28:20.984 --> 28:23.451
Better yet,

28:23.453 --> 28:25.586
what happens when you leave

28:25.588 --> 28:28.656
to start
your own utility company?

28:28.658 --> 28:30.124
Planning on taking
the abnormals with you

28:30.126 --> 28:32.493
as an advisory board?

28:32.495 --> 28:34.929
You're unpleasant
when you use rhetoricals.

28:37.799 --> 28:40.201
Do you think I want to be
left out in the cold,

28:40.203 --> 28:43.171
fighting world powers
at every turn?

28:43.173 --> 28:44.872
I had no choice.

28:44.874 --> 28:47.709
This was the only way
I could continue to operate

28:47.711 --> 28:49.244
without betraying everything
that the Sanctuary stands for.

28:49.246 --> 28:51.714
Yeah, how's that
working for you?

28:51.716 --> 28:53.148
I'm just saying, Helen,

28:53.150 --> 28:55.984
there's a fine line
between passion and fanaticism.

28:57.053 --> 28:58.053
And there's a fine line

28:58.055 --> 28:59.855
between compliance
and surrender.

29:01.758 --> 29:03.859
Let's just hope we're both
on the right side of it...

29:05.195 --> 29:06.762
<i>Nikki</i>.

29:13.304 --> 29:14.137
What now?

29:14.139 --> 29:16.139
We wait
for the signal.

29:21.146 --> 29:23.548
There it is.
Let's go.

29:25.251 --> 29:26.151
You wait here.

29:26.153 --> 29:26.985
But...

29:28.721 --> 29:30.155
Okay, okay.

29:35.227 --> 29:37.494
Everybody, this way.

29:37.496 --> 29:38.996
Quickly!

29:48.772 --> 29:50.773
What the hell happened?

29:50.775 --> 29:51.807
I don't know.
Where are they?

29:56.913 --> 29:58.847
Oh, my God.

30:10.760 --> 30:13.562
Wait, that's it.

30:13.564 --> 30:14.997
Of course.

30:16.767 --> 30:18.067
What?

30:20.538 --> 30:21.371
What?

30:23.274 --> 30:24.975
Heinrich,

30:24.977 --> 30:26.543
how do you dissipate

30:26.545 --> 30:27.978
an electromagnetic
field?

30:27.980 --> 30:30.247
Increase resistance
to the electrical curr...

30:30.249 --> 30:33.283
Wait, that's it.

30:33.285 --> 30:35.786
Of course.

30:35.788 --> 30:37.588
He's a smart one.

30:37.590 --> 30:39.089
Care to fill me in?

30:40.291 --> 30:41.558
The field is
sustaining itself

30:41.560 --> 30:42.626
by drawing power
from the rift.

30:42.628 --> 30:45.162
But if we
re-activate the node

30:45.164 --> 30:47.931
and add resistance
to that flow of energy,

30:47.933 --> 30:49.733
the field will
collapse on itself.

30:49.735 --> 30:50.668
It's like stalling
an engine.

30:50.670 --> 30:52.737
The only downfall--

30:52.739 --> 30:53.871
[tesla]: Heat.

30:53.873 --> 30:54.572
We'll need to
beef up the shielding

30:54.574 --> 30:56.107
on the Cerrelium core.

30:56.109 --> 30:58.811
Shouldn't be an issue if you
have enough titanium on hand.

30:58.813 --> 30:59.812
Which I do.

30:59.814 --> 31:01.113
Small problem.

31:01.115 --> 31:02.415
What?

31:02.417 --> 31:03.349
It's on the other side
of the facility.

31:08.923 --> 31:10.257
If I'm not mistaken,

31:10.259 --> 31:11.825
there's a lab
with some titanium rods

31:11.827 --> 31:12.993
just up ahead.

31:12.995 --> 31:14.195
If you're not mistaken?

31:14.197 --> 31:15.963
Well, it's not easy
navigating in the dark

31:15.965 --> 31:17.798
when all the hallways
look the same, all right?

31:17.800 --> 31:19.100
[Electricity crackles]

31:19.102 --> 31:20.368
Oh, crap, it's back.

31:22.637 --> 31:24.338
Look out!

31:27.809 --> 31:28.609
Henry!

31:37.486 --> 31:39.353
Henry. Oh, Dear Lord...

31:40.105 --> 31:41.071
Helen--

31:41.073 --> 31:42.139
Don't!

31:42.141 --> 31:43.273
This is all your doing!

31:43.275 --> 31:44.944
Your selfish
and base desire

31:44.945 --> 31:46.145
to meddle in things

31:46.147 --> 31:47.780
you don't understand!

31:47.782 --> 31:49.915
Still comfortable with
the human toll, are we?

32:12.137 --> 32:13.104
You better go home.

32:13.106 --> 32:15.941
This could take
a while.

32:15.943 --> 32:17.810
How did this happen?

32:19.113 --> 32:20.780
Some kind of
advanced energy weapon.

32:22.083 --> 32:22.916
Government?

32:24.385 --> 32:26.252
There's no way they'd have
anything that sophisticated.

32:27.488 --> 32:28.821
Besides,
it's not their M.O.

32:28.823 --> 32:30.289
They capture,
they don't kill.

32:30.291 --> 32:31.357
Well, someone knew.

32:31.359 --> 32:33.291
Someone set us up.

32:33.293 --> 32:35.026
Why?

32:35.028 --> 32:36.394
I mean,
it doesn't make any sense.

32:36.396 --> 32:38.062
Who stood to gain from this?

32:39.097 --> 32:40.131
I don't know.

32:41.466 --> 32:42.800
What does Galvo think?

32:42.802 --> 32:45.736
I haven't spoken with him.

32:47.906 --> 32:51.042
I thought he was with you.

32:57.116 --> 32:58.283
Well, it's done.

32:58.285 --> 32:59.585
The titanium rods

32:59.587 --> 33:01.086
will keep the node
from overheating.

33:01.088 --> 33:02.120
Good.

33:02.122 --> 33:04.089
Get on with it.

33:04.091 --> 33:05.791
Once the field
collapses,

33:05.793 --> 33:07.059
the creature,
and anything else,

33:07.061 --> 33:09.028
will be sealed
inside the rift.

33:09.030 --> 33:11.130
Well, what are you waiting for?

33:11.132 --> 33:12.364
Better do it

33:12.366 --> 33:13.899
before the creature
claims another victim.

33:17.871 --> 33:18.804
[Sighing]

33:18.806 --> 33:21.407
[Tracker beeping]

33:21.409 --> 33:25.244
What the hell is that?

33:25.246 --> 33:26.912
[Magnus]:
It can't be.

33:26.914 --> 33:28.047
It's impossible.

33:28.049 --> 33:28.881
[Tesla]:
You recognize it?

33:28.883 --> 33:31.550
It's Henry's tracking signal.

33:31.552 --> 33:34.186
Similar to the one we used
to find this place.

33:34.188 --> 33:36.322
This means
he might be alive somewhere.

33:36.324 --> 33:38.825
[Tesla]: It's coming from
inside a cave pocket.

33:38.827 --> 33:40.927
Inside the rift field,
underneath the facility.

33:40.929 --> 33:43.496
The creature must be adapting
to our physical environment.

33:43.498 --> 33:45.131
I suspect
it's built a nest somewhere.

33:45.133 --> 33:46.499
Well, there's
no way in or out.

33:46.501 --> 33:47.333
It's solid rock.

33:47.335 --> 33:48.501
Then we have no choice.

33:48.503 --> 33:49.736
What?

33:49.738 --> 33:50.837
What, you're not
seriously considering--

33:50.839 --> 33:53.106
When Adam Worth trapped me
in that warehouse,

33:53.108 --> 33:54.307
he traveled through the rift

33:54.309 --> 33:55.943
using a serious
of predetermined exit points.

33:55.945 --> 33:58.044
Yes, with an emphasis
on "predetermined."

33:58.046 --> 33:59.012
You're talking about

33:59.014 --> 34:00.347
locking onto a tracking signal

34:00.349 --> 34:01.982
through
an inter-dimensional void.

34:01.984 --> 34:03.984
If I'm off by even
the slightest margin--

34:03.986 --> 34:05.118
I have faith in you.

34:06.587 --> 34:08.054
Fine,

34:08.056 --> 34:10.556
but you're
not going, I am.

34:10.559 --> 34:13.594
The burns and radiation sickness
won't affect me.

34:13.596 --> 34:14.762
Vampire.

34:14.764 --> 34:17.164
Yes.
I blame myself for that.

34:17.166 --> 34:19.367
However, I am going to need
someone on the outside

34:19.369 --> 34:21.902
to distract the creature
long enough for me to get in,

34:21.905 --> 34:23.337
grab Wolfgang, and get out.

34:23.339 --> 34:27.108
Just in case you thought
you were getting off easy.

34:29.078 --> 34:30.512
Galvo?

34:30.514 --> 34:32.214
[Gasps in surprise]

34:32.216 --> 34:33.315
Thank God you found me--

34:33.317 --> 34:34.483
Stop.

34:34.485 --> 34:36.319
I know you did it.

34:39.489 --> 34:40.924
[In lower voice]:
You got me.

34:40.926 --> 34:42.159
Those abnormals,

34:42.161 --> 34:44.460
what did they do to you?

34:44.463 --> 34:46.929
Not a thing.

34:46.931 --> 34:48.031
Then why?

34:48.033 --> 34:51.467
Why would you kill
your own kind?

34:51.469 --> 34:53.270
Because they were weak.

34:53.272 --> 34:55.072
My group came here

34:55.074 --> 34:57.507
to claim this land as our own.

34:57.509 --> 34:59.509
We pledged to fight
for as long as we had to,

34:59.511 --> 35:01.478
die if necessary,

35:01.480 --> 35:04.948
to win back the surface from
those self-entitled humans.

35:04.950 --> 35:06.516
Ah.

35:06.518 --> 35:09.052
But the Chalkstone group
lost faith in our mission.

35:09.054 --> 35:11.421
They broke off
from the rest of us.

35:11.423 --> 35:13.422
I was sent to find them.

35:13.424 --> 35:16.157
All they wanted was to go home.

35:16.159 --> 35:18.259
They were traitors
to our cause.

35:18.261 --> 35:19.527
They deserved what they got.

35:19.529 --> 35:20.928
Enough...

35:27.535 --> 35:29.403
Deceiving, isn't it?

35:29.405 --> 35:30.938
I'm a Fendalope.

35:35.646 --> 35:37.679
Just like this.

35:43.986 --> 35:46.587
Sorry it had to end this way.

35:46.589 --> 35:49.123
You really were
a nice guy.

35:58.633 --> 35:59.567
You okay?

35:59.569 --> 36:02.370
Yeah.

36:04.572 --> 36:06.473
Let's get him to the Sanctuary.

36:08.243 --> 36:09.644
All right, I'm going to
modulate the field

36:09.646 --> 36:10.978
and try to bring out
the creature.

36:10.980 --> 36:12.013
Are you ready?

36:12.015 --> 36:14.382
As I'll ever be.

41:14.512 --> 41:16.379
that report
you asked for.

41:16.381 --> 41:17.647
Relax.

41:17.649 --> 41:20.418
I just came to tell you
that your tests came back.

41:20.420 --> 41:24.021
No sign of radiation
poisoning whatsoever.

41:24.023 --> 41:25.390
Your HAP physiology

41:25.392 --> 41:28.059
must have protected you
from the effects of the rift.

41:28.061 --> 41:29.461
Count yourself lucky.

41:29.463 --> 41:30.696
Yeah.

41:30.698 --> 41:33.566
Lucky is exactly
what I count myself.

41:33.568 --> 41:36.135
You hear from Tesla?

41:36.137 --> 41:37.869
No,

41:37.871 --> 41:39.338
and I don't expect
that I will.

41:39.340 --> 41:42.440
He's still refusing
to quit his job, so...

41:42.442 --> 41:44.209
We're on opposite sides,
I'm afraid.

41:44.211 --> 41:45.243
Oh, man.

41:45.245 --> 41:46.444
I'm sorry, Doc.

41:46.446 --> 41:47.512
Me too.

41:47.514 --> 41:49.447
I always knew there'd be costs

41:49.449 --> 41:52.449
associated with striking out
on our own, but...

41:52.451 --> 41:54.218
This one was unexpected.

41:56.487 --> 41:59.389
[Tablet beeping]

41:59.391 --> 42:00.658
Um, Doc, hang on a second.

42:00.660 --> 42:02.493
[Download beeps]

42:02.495 --> 42:04.929
You're going to
want to see this.

42:10.236 --> 42:12.037
Where did you get this?

42:12.039 --> 42:14.473
It was on my tablet.

42:14.475 --> 42:17.610
Tesla handed it to me
as we were leaving.

42:19.246 --> 42:20.145
A detailed list

42:20.147 --> 42:22.213
of all of SCIU's facilities,

42:22.215 --> 42:24.349
abnormal inventory,

42:24.351 --> 42:27.185
and top-secret plans
for future expansion.

42:28.554 --> 42:31.156
Ah, Nikola.

42:31.158 --> 42:32.958
You are full of surprises.
