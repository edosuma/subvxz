WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:01.300
Agent 47, wake up.

00:04.400 --> 00:05.200
Agent 47,

00:05.900 --> 00:07.600
I just got word your mission is over.

00:08.500 --> 00:09.700
It's been terminated.

00:14.700 --> 00:15.800
Take a drink of this.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.600
I'm sorry, I don't really like the taste.

00:18.700 --> 00:20.000
Okay, I hear that.

00:20.300 --> 00:21.700
But it's policy.

00:23.700 --> 00:25.600
Please, no! I don't like the taste!

00:25.700 --> 00:27.600
I understand, but my hands are tied.

00:27.802 --> 00:29.001
It's policy.

00:29.400 --> 00:32.104
Come on now, keep your mouth open.

00:32.403 --> 00:36.009
There's nothing I can do.
I'm just following procedure.

00:43.900 --> 00:44.900
You should feel good.

00:45.500 --> 00:46.700
What you've accomplished...

00:46.900 --> 00:49.100
the definition of a job well done.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:59.000 --> 01:02.400
So... would you like to see your next mission?

01:08.200 --> 01:09.200
No...!

01:09.200 --> 01:09.900
No!

01:10.000 --> 01:12.400
Your next assignment involves
research into the effects of gravity

01:12.500 --> 01:13.800
on the human skull.

01:14.210 --> 01:17.000
My friends here are going
to let go of your legs.

01:17.100 --> 01:19.500
And then, we're all going
to place bets on how big a spot

01:19.700 --> 01:21.300
you leave on the sidewalk.

01:21.500 --> 01:22.700
Pretty exciting, huh?

01:23.100 --> 01:25.300
- One... - No, no, please!

01:25.300 --> 01:25.800
two...

01:25.900 --> 01:27.600
This isn't what I signed up for!

01:27.700 --> 01:28.700
three.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.500
You okay?

01:42.000 --> 01:44.600
I just had the craziest dream.

01:49.300 --> 01:51.400
Did you just hear yourself?

01:51.700 --> 01:55.000
No, I mean, David Carradine was in it.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.300
He fell to his death.

01:57.300 --> 02:02.700
These guys, they pushed him
off this building and he died.

02:02.700 --> 02:04.200
That's what I dreamt about.

02:04.300 --> 02:07.000
Wow. That sounds damn near...

02:07.300 --> 02:09.100
normal.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.100
You think so?

02:11.200 --> 02:12.900
Yeah, absolutely.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.200
To be perfectly honest,
I just had  a crazy dream, too.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.600
No kidding?

02:19.000 --> 02:21.800
No. I was on a desert island

02:22.200 --> 02:25.900
and there was no one there
but me and Angelina Jolie.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.500
- What are you... - That's not funny.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.500
I thought we were having a conversation.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.500
I don't even find her attractive.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.000
What are you doing?

03:30.400 --> 03:31.800
Shh!

03:31.800 --> 03:33.500
You're not supposed to read at the table.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.100
Mom.

03:36.500 --> 03:37.500
What, Ariel?

03:38.900 --> 03:39.900
Nothing.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.500
It's 20 after 7:00.
Why did you let me sleep?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.500
I don't know. You seemed happy.

03:44.700 --> 03:47.900
Besides, there's no way I was going
to get between you and Angelina.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.100
Who's Angelina?

03:49.200 --> 03:50.300
No one.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.100
A friend of your father's.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.900
I take it there are no mentions of Grasshopper
tumbling to his death in this morning's paper.

03:57.900 --> 03:59.600
No, not a one.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.000
Hmm.

04:02.900 --> 04:03.500
What's that?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.200
What's what?

04:05.400 --> 04:05.900
That.

04:07.100 --> 04:08.600
That quiet.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.100
I find it unsettling at
this hour of the morning.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.800
Where's the noise?
Where's the commotion?

04:13.200 --> 04:14.300
Bridgette's reading.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.399
Shh! Shh!

04:18.100 --> 04:20.700
Danielle in Danger?
Didn't we read that last night, Bridge?

04:20.899 --> 04:22.700
I know, but I really like it.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.400
Danielle in Danger, Danielle in Distress,
Danielle in the Deep End--

04:25.500 --> 04:27.700
she has them all.
She reads them all the time.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Last time, I found her
in the bathroom reading it.

04:30.100 --> 04:31.000
They're good.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.500
You're getting food all over it.

04:37.700 --> 04:40.300
Am not. Am not.

04:40.700 --> 04:42.900
And the only reason I'm reading it again

04:42.900 --> 04:46.400
is because we don't have
any more, and I like it.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.800
And I like that you like it.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.300
I like it, too.In fact,

04:49.300 --> 04:52.200
I'm going to stop by the bookstore
on my way home from work tonight.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.200
Whatever else Danielle is in,

04:54.200 --> 04:55.700
I'm going to find it.

04:55.700 --> 04:56.200
Really?

04:56.300 --> 04:57.200
Sure.

04:57.600 --> 05:00.500
Danielle at the Deli, Danielle in Duluth,
Danielle in the Dumps.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.400
Wherever  Danielle has been,

05:02.400 --> 05:03.900
I'm going to find it.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.700
I must apologize for the other evening.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.100
Is there some reason
you won't look at me?

05:31.800 --> 05:35.000
I mean, other than the obvious.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.600
It must have been a horrible way to die.

05:43.100 --> 05:44.300
I was left with no choice.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.300
The agency was left
with no choice. I mean,

05:46.600 --> 05:48.200
we have to preserve the code.

05:48.900 --> 05:49.700
Right?

05:53.600 --> 05:56.000
I just hope that someday...

05:56.600 --> 05:58.300
you find a way to forgive us all.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.300
Ma'am, are you getting out?

06:11.500 --> 06:13.400
I'm not a big one to solicit favors.

06:14.700 --> 06:19.200
My wife does charity work with
a woman named Jessica Delany.

06:19.300 --> 06:22.000
Her brother's been missing
for almost two weeks now, and...

06:22.410 --> 06:26.400
she asked me if I knew someone who could check
it out without actually making it a police matter.

06:27.500 --> 06:28.700
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.700
Her brother's apparently
something of a wild hair.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.700
Hasn't been able to hold down
a job for years, pretty eccentric guy.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.600
But it's not like him to not stay in touch.

06:38.800 --> 06:43.000
And as I mentioned, they've not been able
to make contact with him for almost two weeks.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
She and her husband basically support him.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.800
I still don't get it. Why call you?

06:50.800 --> 06:52.700
Why avoid the police?
And if you've got to avoid the police,

06:52.800 --> 06:54.200
why not just hire a private detective?

06:54.300 --> 06:56.900
They did hire a private detective.
He came up with nothing.

06:56.900 --> 06:58.600
So why not go to the police?

06:58.800 --> 07:01.700
Apparently, along with a
host of other eccentric habits,

07:01.700 --> 07:03.300
this guy's terrified of the police.

07:03.300 --> 07:06.100
They're worried that if law
enforcement starts snooping around,

07:06.200 --> 07:07.700
he'll never come out of hiding.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.700
I  was hoping between the two of you...

07:10.400 --> 07:11.100
Sure.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.300
I can do the usual--
call the hospitals, the morgue.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.800
And, if you don't mind,

07:17.200 --> 07:20.300
this is his address and his
landlord's phone number.

07:20.500 --> 07:23.300
The landlord's been told to expect
a phone call from a family friend

07:23.400 --> 07:26.300
who might show up,
want to take a look around.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.100
I'm happy to try.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
You want some company?

07:31.600 --> 07:32.400
Sure.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.100
I'll call you after I make
contact with the landlord.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.500
Codes are amazing,
aren't they Miss Dubois?

07:39.800 --> 07:42.200
Life is a kind of a code,isn't it?

07:44.700 --> 07:45.700
And death.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.800
Death is a kind of code, too.

07:49.700 --> 07:50.900
Wouldn't you say?

07:51.700 --> 07:53.900
If there's any way we can
do it on my way home tonight,

07:54.400 --> 07:55.500
say around 8:00...

07:56.300 --> 07:57.100
Allison.

08:01.500 --> 08:02.500
Allison?

08:12.500 --> 08:15.000
Hi, excuse me.
I'm looking for the Danielle books.

08:15.400 --> 08:16.500
Danielle in Danger...Those...

08:16.600 --> 08:18.900
Oh, Beverly Rhodes.
She's a wonderful writer.

08:19.202 --> 08:21.901
Right here we have three.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.004
Danielle in Danger,Danielle in Distress

08:24.003 --> 08:25.409
and Danielle in the Deep End.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.600
Ah, yes, no. Those are the ones we have.

08:27.700 --> 08:30.000
I was hoping there might be some others.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.299
Let's check the computer.

08:34.799 --> 08:37.000
I'm sorry, those are the only
three that were published.

08:39.299 --> 08:43.000
Hmm. Oh. Um, okay.

08:43.100 --> 08:44.100
Are there any more coming?

08:44.200 --> 08:45.700
Is old Beverly banging out another one?

08:45.800 --> 08:48.900
I got a little one who's
just nuts for these things.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.400
I kind of doubt it.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.200
Beverly Rhodes passed away last year.

08:54.300 --> 08:57.100
"And so, Danielle declared,
'It pays to be prepared.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.100
"'With homework done, there's time for fun.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.300
No distress anywhere.'"

09:04.400 --> 09:05.300
Night, Angel.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.800
Night, Daddy.

09:08.100 --> 09:08.800
Okay.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.300
You read that good, Daddy.

09:13.400 --> 09:14.800
Thank you, I appreciate that.

09:14.900 --> 09:16.400
I know this can be a tough room.

09:16.900 --> 09:18.100
I love Danielle.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.800
I know you do, sweetheart.

09:20.900 --> 09:23.200
Uh, but you know what I was thinking?

09:23.300 --> 09:24.800
I was thinking that maybe we
should start reading some other books

09:24.900 --> 09:26.900
and give Danielle a rest
for a little while, huh?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.500
But I don't want to give Danielle a rest.

09:29.900 --> 09:33.000
I want to read everything
there is to read about her.

09:33.300 --> 09:35.400
Well, as it turns out,
I think that you have.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.500
There are only three books,
honey, you have them all.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.800
- Nuh-uh. - Mm-hmm.

09:39.900 --> 09:42.300
Sure you do. You got
Distress, Danger, Deep End.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.400
That's all there is.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.500
Nuh-uh. I know there's another one.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.100
I don't think so, honey.
I'll check again, but I don't think so.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.600
In the meantime,
don't let those bedbugs bite.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.600
I won't, Daddy.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.400
Must be the maid's year off.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.000
What do you think all this stuff is about?

10:15.100 --> 10:16.000
I don't know.

10:16.600 --> 10:19.300
Maybe he's calculated how much to tip
the guy who delivered all these pizzas.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.300
Yes, sir.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.400
Yeah, I'm at liberty to do that.

10:45.600 --> 10:49.600
Los Angeles, the Harmon Hotel,
day after tomorrow.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.100
No, I can do that.

10:53.300 --> 10:55.300
Check in and wait to hear from you.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.300
I got it.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.800
Think our boy took a little trip.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Drawers are open,
clothes seem to be missing.

11:03.700 --> 11:06.400
No toothbrush or toothpaste
or comb in the bathroom.

11:09.100 --> 11:11.100
No wallet, no I.D., no keys.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.300
You  all right?

11:16.000 --> 11:16.900
Yeah.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.600
I think he might be in Los Angeles.

11:20.100 --> 11:21.400
The Harmon Hotel.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.100
Okay.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.500
Anything else?

11:27.000 --> 11:27.900
Yeah.

11:28.500 --> 11:31.300
I think he might look
a lot like David Carradine.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.200
You  awake?

11:49.200 --> 11:50.500
Oh, yeah.

11:56.700 --> 11:57.600
What are you doing?

11:58.500 --> 12:00.100
Is that Daddy's work computer?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.600
You know you're never supposed
to play with Daddy's work computer.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.300
I'm sorry.

12:06.300 --> 12:07.500
How long were you there?

12:09.000 --> 12:12.400
I don't know. A little while, I guess.

12:13.200 --> 12:13.900
Bridgette.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.300
What did the misfit of science do now?

12:17.400 --> 12:18.000
Ariel.

12:18.100 --> 12:19.100
None of your beeswax.

12:19.200 --> 12:20.300
Who cares.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.200
Can I have some microwave oatmeal?

12:23.500 --> 12:24.400
Yeah.

12:26.300 --> 12:27.900
You left the bathroom a mess again.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.100
Did not.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.700
Your underwear is on the counter.

12:31.800 --> 12:35.000
Your towel is in the tub,
and you don't flush.

12:35.100 --> 12:36.500
- Do, too.
- Do not.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.200
- Do, too.
- Do not.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.000
Do, too.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.300
Fine, then whose poo was it
in the toilet this morning, huh?

12:41.500 --> 12:43.700
- Not my poo.
- Was, too.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.700
- Not my poo.
- Was, too.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.900
- Not my poo.
- Was, too!

12:47.900 --> 12:53.400
Can we not... discuss poo
at the kitchen table?

12:56.200 --> 12:57.000
Thank you.

12:57.900 --> 12:59.200
Can you come here for a minute?

13:00.000 --> 13:00.900
What's up?

13:01.000 --> 13:03.100
I need to cook something for one minute.

13:12.900 --> 13:13.700
Okay.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.200
You were looking for me?

13:21.400 --> 13:22.400
Yeah, come in.

13:26.900 --> 13:27.900
So I've known you for what,

13:28.700 --> 13:29.900
little over a year now?

13:30.610 --> 13:32.700
And I have to confess,
that every time one of...

13:33.000 --> 13:35.100
- your things comes true.
- What are you talking about?

13:35.600 --> 13:36.900
Jessica Delany's brother?

13:37.700 --> 13:40.300
He was registered at the
Harmon Hotel in Los Angeles.

13:40.800 --> 13:44.500
I was authorized by the family early this 
morning to send Detective Scanlon out there.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.000
So...

13:49.300 --> 13:50.500
Thank you.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.900
I'm very appreciative,
and I just wanted to tell you so.

13:58.300 --> 14:00.100
Have you given any thought to our problem?

14:01.500 --> 14:03.300
How do we thwart these terrorists?

14:03.400 --> 14:05.400
How do we stop them before they strike?

14:07.500 --> 14:08.400
Who are you?

14:08.900 --> 14:10.800
What are you?

14:11.900 --> 14:13.100
Are you a ghost?

14:13.200 --> 14:15.400
Are you a hallucination? Are you a dream?

14:15.800 --> 14:18.400
You understand how these
terrorists operate, don't you?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.700
When a terrorist needs to communicate,

14:20.900 --> 14:22.900
he or she requests a password.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.600
They can do this from anywhere,

14:24.700 --> 14:27.300
from a payphone,
from a cell phone, an email.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.700
The means is unimportant.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.900
What  is important is they are then
sent a password over the phone,

14:31.900 --> 14:35.500
over the Internet,
over a pager, not terribly secure.

14:36.100 --> 14:37.900
But what they do with that password

14:38.100 --> 14:40.000
is they enter it into a device like this,

14:40.200 --> 14:42.600
which uses a complex algorithmic formula

14:42.700 --> 14:44.600
to create a new password,

14:44.700 --> 14:47.100
the real password, a fluid password,

14:47.200 --> 14:50.100
a password that changes every six seconds.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.100
I'm asking you

14:52.800 --> 14:58.600
please sit down and crack the algorithmic
formula that makes this conversion possible.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.100
I'm sorry.

15:03.100 --> 15:05.900
I don't understand.
I think you have the wrong person.

15:06.900 --> 15:08.100
Are you not the one

15:08.300 --> 15:10.600
who said Harmon Hotel?

15:11.800 --> 15:13.600
Allison, it's a simple "thank you".

15:13.700 --> 15:16.600
Just accept it gracefully, and get the hell
out of here so I can do my work.

15:17.700 --> 15:20.600
Yeah... yes, yes, of course, sir.

15:54.100 --> 15:55.900
You think they're all
watching you, don't you?

15:56.400 --> 15:58.900
That's the paranoia kicking in.
You have drugs for that.

15:59.100 --> 16:00.400
Don't worry about them.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.100
Me and my people
will take care of them.

16:02.200 --> 16:05.000
All you need to be thinking
about is code decode,

16:05.100 --> 16:06.300
code decode, code decode.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.600
Code decode! Code decode!

16:08.200 --> 16:09.500
Code decode!

16:09.601 --> 16:10.901
Code decode !

16:11.302 --> 16:12.602
Code decode !

16:40.400 --> 16:41.200
Hi.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.500
Hey. You all right? You sound stressed.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.100
You called me. What's going on?

16:45.300 --> 16:47.000
I'm just trying to figure something out.

16:47.100 --> 16:49.700
I'm transferring files from my
laptop to my office computer,

16:49.800 --> 16:51.700
and there are some files here
that I don't recognize.

16:52.100 --> 16:53.300
Um, did you maybe...

16:53.400 --> 16:55.000
Bridgette was playing
with it this morning.

16:56.200 --> 16:59.700
I'm sorry-- I stopped her. I don't think
she had a chance to do any real harm.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.400
It's okay. As long as I know what it is.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.099
I didn't know whether to
print it out or throw it away.

17:10.500 --> 17:10.900
All right.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.599
Listen, I got to go.
The coast is clear.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.300
The coast is clear? Al?

17:32.200 --> 17:33.500
I'm really sorry.

17:38.300 --> 17:41.400
I'm sorry to put you through all this.

17:45.500 --> 17:49.300
It's really horrible,
their eyes following you like that.

17:49.900 --> 17:54.100
Convinced they're all
watching you, all after you.

17:56.300 --> 18:00.000
I suspect you're a lot like me...

18:00.300 --> 18:02.900
smart enough to know
it's not really happening,

18:03.400 --> 18:04.500
but still,

18:04.600 --> 18:08.500
the heart starts to race,
the adrenaline starts to kick in.

18:11.100 --> 18:15.500
It's impossible not to be sucked into it.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.900
So these are delusions?

18:21.100 --> 18:23.700
It's all life, right?

18:24.700 --> 18:27.200
I mean, I'm not really sure.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.400
I'm a  mathematician,
not a psychiatrist,

18:32.200 --> 18:34.500
but I strongly suspect that

18:34.600 --> 18:37.300
everything I'm seeing,
everything I'm feeling,

18:37.900 --> 18:41.400
some of it probably isn't there.

18:43.800 --> 18:46.900
So these things that I'm seeing,
these things that I'm feeling...

18:50.000 --> 18:51.600
you're sending them to me?

18:52.300 --> 18:53.600
I think so.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.300
Even that man who keeps talking about codes?

18:58.400 --> 19:01.700
So what are these?
Are these memories or fantasies?

19:02.400 --> 19:04.100
All sorts of things.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.700
Probably a little bit of everything.

19:07.900 --> 19:09.100
I'm really sorry.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.300
You know, you look like a famous actor.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.400
Really?

19:23.800 --> 19:24.900
My goodness.

19:26.300 --> 19:28.500
Anyone I would recognise ?

19:28.900 --> 19:31.400
Do you know who David Carradine is?

19:33.400 --> 19:34.500
Of course.

19:35.700 --> 19:39.600
I imagine I'm him a lot.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.500
Lots of guys.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.600
Lots of different times...

19:45.600 --> 19:47.600
but him a lot.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.500
Allison?

19:55.300 --> 19:57.000
What are you doing in
here with the lights off?

19:59.400 --> 20:00.600
Tell me you're all right.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.000
I'm  all right.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.800
Yeah. Well,

20:06.500 --> 20:07.700
you just did me a favor,

20:07.900 --> 20:09.000
now I'm going to do you one--

20:09.400 --> 20:10.900
go home. Take the rest of the day off.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.200
That's not necessary.

20:12.300 --> 20:14.900
Okay, it's not a favor. It's an order.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.500
See you tomorrow.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.800
Movie star guy. Movie star guy.

20:25.300 --> 20:27.000
Movie star guy?

20:28.000 --> 20:29.400
I need you to wake up.

20:29.700 --> 20:31.300
There's someone on the phone for you.

20:31.400 --> 20:34.600
Mom. Didn't you hear me?

20:34.700 --> 20:37.200
I said "Mom, there's someone
on the phone for you."

20:37.900 --> 20:40.000
Sorry, honey, I must have dozed off.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.000
Hello?

20:42.200 --> 20:43.200
Greetings from L.A.--

20:43.300 --> 20:45.200
what do you want to hear,
the good, the bad, or the weird?

20:45.500 --> 20:47.400
Well, it can't get any weirder
than it's been her

20:47.500 --> 20:49.200
 so start wherever you'd like.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.300
Well the good news is
he was here, all right.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.800
The bad news is, apparently, he jumped off
the roof of this place two nights ago.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.700
They've been trying to I.D. him ever since.

20:56.800 --> 20:57.800
I'm waiting for a car now

20:57.900 --> 21:01.100
to take me to the airport pick up the family,
escort them to the morgue.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.000
Don't laugh,

21:04.200 --> 21:05.900
but are you sure he jumped?

21:06.200 --> 21:07.300
Which brings us to the weird part.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.900
Allison, this guy was as
nutty as a fruitcake.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.500
His bathroom counter was covered with
prescription antipsychotic medications,

21:13.600 --> 21:15.600
none of which were found in
his stomach, by the way.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.900
He was a textbook paranoid
schizophrenic who went off his meds

21:19.100 --> 21:21.700
and jumped off a diving
board that wasn't there.

21:22.100 --> 21:23.100
I'm just curious.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.800
Any of the people there,
any of the people who saw him,

21:27.900 --> 21:29.300
any of the people at the hotel,

21:30.600 --> 21:32.700
did anyone happen to mention
that he looked like...

21:35.500 --> 21:36.800
a movie star?

21:37.600 --> 21:38.400
What?

21:39.500 --> 21:40.300
Nothing.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.400
"She was no fool, while in the pool.

21:46.600 --> 21:49.800
"Danielle played smart,
followed all the rules.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.400
"She made safety her friend,

21:52.700 --> 21:54.300
while in the deep end."

21:55.600 --> 21:57.000
You read that good, Daddy.

21:57.300 --> 21:58.400
My biggest fan.

21:59.800 --> 22:00.800
Sleep tight.

22:01.800 --> 22:02.900
I'll see you in the morning.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.100
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, sweetie.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.500
Close your eyes. Good girl. Okay.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.100
- Daddy?
- Yes, sweetie.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.500
When are we going to read the new one?

22:17.600 --> 22:18.700
The new one what, babe?

22:18.800 --> 22:19.900
The new Danielle.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.800
Honey, I explained that to you yesterday.

22:22.900 --> 22:25.600
There is no new Danielle.
There's only three Danielle books,

22:25.700 --> 22:27.000
and we have them all.

22:27.200 --> 22:28.600
Nuh-uh. There's another one.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.100
No, sweetie, only three.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.400
The woman who wrote them...
 she's not writing them anymore.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.400
She's done with Danielle.

22:36.700 --> 22:37.500
Nuh-uh.

22:37.800 --> 22:38.900
There's another one.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.700
She told it to me.

22:41.500 --> 22:43.300
I wrote it on your computer.

22:44.800 --> 22:45.900
So, where's your laptop?

22:46.300 --> 22:49.300
At the office. Of course.
'Cause I need it at home.

22:52.400 --> 22:53.800
Well, don't stress about it.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.100
You'll go to work,

22:56.200 --> 22:58.000
you'll print out the file and you'll see.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.200
How can you be so calm?

23:00.800 --> 23:02.300
I mean, what choice do I have?

23:03.100 --> 23:05.700
What would be so terrible
if you opened your computer

23:05.800 --> 23:08.300
and discovered that you
do have a new Danielle book?

23:08.400 --> 23:10.000
What would be so terrible?

23:10.800 --> 23:15.200
Don't you find it at all disturbing that your daughter
may have taken dictation from a dead woman?

23:17.100 --> 23:19.000
What's the matter with me?
Look at who I'm asking.

23:19.100 --> 23:20.100
What does that mean?

23:20.200 --> 23:21.300
I don't know. I just...

23:21.400 --> 23:23.200
This is just one of those times when
I think I would have preferred

23:23.300 --> 23:25.600
if they'd inherited your allergy to ragweed.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.500
I don't mean that. I'm just...

23:31.500 --> 23:32.900
She just turned seven.

23:32.900 --> 23:35.900
I'd like to believe that I have a little bit
of control over who her friends are,

23:36.100 --> 23:37.600
who she spends her time with.

23:37.700 --> 23:39.000
Maybe you're jumping the gun.

23:39.100 --> 23:41.800
You know, you may very well get
to work, turn on that computer,

23:41.800 --> 23:43.900
and find you have nothing
but gobbledygook.

23:44.300 --> 23:46.100
That would be a tremendous relief.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.000
Is there any word from Scanlon?

24:04.400 --> 24:08.700
Her sister and her husband identified
the body a couple of hours ago.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.900
Apparently, he was a PhD candidate

24:14.600 --> 24:15.900
at Stanford.

24:17.100 --> 24:20.600
He started hearing voices
and seeing things in 1997.

24:22.600 --> 24:25.200
He was doing pretty good on meds till 9/11.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.900
Then he became convinced that he
held the key to some sort of coding device.

24:31.300 --> 24:35.500
So he went off his meds so he could
concentrate on his mathematical equations.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.400
He'd disappear for days,

24:38.600 --> 24:40.200
pop up in other cities.

24:41.100 --> 24:43.900
She pleaded with him to
go back on his prescriptions,

24:45.000 --> 24:46.300
but he said that...

24:48.900 --> 24:51.400
they interfered with his thought process.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.500
His government work.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.100
That's sad.

24:59.700 --> 25:02.600
I'm gonna meet with the sister
and her husband tomorrow.

25:04.700 --> 25:06.900
I can't even imagine
what they're going through.

25:12.100 --> 25:12.900
Hello.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.700
"Danielle chose not to play,
Danielle felt bad that day.

25:15.800 --> 25:18.100
"Her smile was gone, her spirit wan.

25:18.500 --> 25:20.400
Her best friend had moved away."

25:21.000 --> 25:23.500
Well, darling,
there's no gobble in that gook.

25:24.400 --> 25:25.200
Allison?

25:25.300 --> 25:26.600
I-I... I don't know what to say.

25:26.700 --> 25:28.400
I'm late for a meeting.
I don't know what to say.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.200
Well, what is there to say?

25:30.300 --> 25:32.100
Oprah has a book club.
Why shouldn't Bridgette?

25:32.300 --> 25:33.100
Joe...

25:33.300 --> 25:35.900
Hey, think about it.
There are a lot of great, dead authors.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.900
She could channel a new
Hemingway novel, a new Dickens.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.900
Imagine. A Tale of Three Cities.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.200
C-Can we discuss this tonight?

25:43.300 --> 25:44.600
Can we discuss this when I get home?

25:44.700 --> 25:46.500
I suppose. Danielle will keep.

25:46.700 --> 25:48.400
And the author certainly
isn't going anywhere.

25:48.800 --> 25:50.500
- Sure. Tonight.
- Thank you.

25:50.600 --> 25:51.600
Have a good meeting.

25:51.700 --> 25:52.700
I'll try.

25:53.100 --> 25:54.400
Nice of you to finally show up.

25:54.800 --> 25:55.900
Sorry.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.100
It's okay. Nice people.

25:58.300 --> 26:00.400
Jessica Delany's very
anxious to meet the woman

26:00.500 --> 26:03.200
whose good old-fashioned detective
work helped her find her brother.

26:08.900 --> 26:12.000
Jessica, this is Allison Dubois.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.600
She's the investigator who figured
out that your brother was in Los Angeles.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I'm so sorry about how things turned out.

26:18.100 --> 26:19.600
I'm so sorry about your brother.

26:19.900 --> 26:21.600
I appreciate that. Thank you.

26:21.700 --> 26:24.100
Um, this is my husband David.

26:24.200 --> 26:25.200
Um, can you hold on a minute?

26:25.300 --> 26:27.200
I'm sorry. Forgive me. It's the mortuary.

26:27.300 --> 26:28.500
You are, um...

26:28.600 --> 26:29.900
Agent 47, wake up.

26:31.900 --> 26:34.800
Allison. Allison Dubois.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.400
You saw him throw his brother-in-law
off the roof of that hotel?

26:41.500 --> 26:43.000
Yes. Well, no.

26:43.100 --> 26:46.700
Actually, I saw him throw David Carradine
off the roof of that Hotel.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.600
Actually, it was two guys he hired.

26:48.700 --> 26:50.400
But I don't think that'
an important distinction.

26:50.500 --> 26:53.200
Okay. Now I am confused.

26:53.200 --> 26:56.000
How exactly does David Carradine
figure into any of this?

26:56.400 --> 26:58.600
Well, I'm not sure, but my best guess is,

26:58.700 --> 27:00.700
the night that David
Delany's brother-in-law died,

27:00.800 --> 27:02.900
his spirit started sending me messages.

27:03.300 --> 27:05.000
And unfortunately, they were the messages

27:05.100 --> 27:08.200
of a mentally ill man who's been
off his medication for some time.

27:08.900 --> 27:12.300
So, the things that he showed me
were the way that he perceived them.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.100
The world that he lives in--

27:14.200 --> 27:16.000
he's the star of his own movie.

27:16.100 --> 27:17.500
He's the superhero.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.600
He's a man fighting an unbeatable foe.

27:20.700 --> 27:22.900
And of course, he made
himself look like a movie star.

27:23.500 --> 27:27.600
I can't dismiss the fact that he cast
his brother-in-law as the villain.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.200
That in his mind, in his delusion,

27:30.300 --> 27:32.100
this is the man who betrayed him.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.300
This is the man responsible for his death.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.300
Delusion is the key wordere.

27:37.100 --> 27:38.700
He didn't look like a movie star,

27:38.800 --> 27:41.000
or a superhero in life, and he wasn't one.

27:41.500 --> 27:44.800
And insofar as we can determine,
he wasn't doing any work for the government,

27:44.900 --> 27:47.300
wasn't actually cracking terrorist codes.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.400
Now, I'll happily ask,

27:49.500 --> 27:52.500
but I'm reasonably certain that the
gentleman in that conference room

27:52.600 --> 27:54.500
has a perfectly logical explanation

27:54.600 --> 27:57.300
for where he was the night
of his brother-in-law's fall.

27:57.500 --> 28:00.600
After all, he is the one who's been
supporting him for the last five years.

28:00.700 --> 28:02.800
And according to Jessica,
they were very close.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.600
Actually spent a fair
amount of time together.

28:07.800 --> 28:10.100
Is this really something
you want us to pursue?

28:10.500 --> 28:11.600
I don't know.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.500
You're right. It's crazy.

28:19.900 --> 28:21.600
He jumped, but it's just...

28:22.000 --> 28:23.900
The movie's always more
interesting than the truth.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.900
It's you and this guy's ***.

28:26.300 --> 28:28.300
You saw all that nonsense he was working on.

28:28.900 --> 28:30.100
These are nice people.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.600
They're already in a fair amount of pain.

28:32.900 --> 28:35.600
I'd rather not go in there and
open this particular can of worms

28:35.700 --> 28:37.600
unless you're absolutely certain.

28:38.900 --> 28:40.400
No. No, you're right.

28:40.500 --> 28:42.500
We shouldn't.

28:51.500 --> 28:52.400
What are those?

28:52.600 --> 28:53.600
Personal effects.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.000
We were holding onto
them as possible evidence.

28:56.100 --> 29:00.900
Jessica wants the family photos, a scrapbook,
and her husband wants to hold on to the math.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.200
The math?

29:02.300 --> 29:04.700
The stuff on the walls. He's a finance guy.

29:04.800 --> 29:06.500
Apparently, he's fascinated by the stuff.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.400
Uh, could you hold on to
those for a couple of days

29:10.500 --> 29:12.700
so I could take a look at them...
the math, I mean?

29:17.400 --> 29:19.200
I was half hoping I'd read
this stuff and convince myself

29:19.300 --> 29:21.100
it was all a product of
Bridgette's imagination,

29:21.200 --> 29:24.000
but I just don't see her
coming up with words like "wan."

29:25.300 --> 29:27.400
I couldn't even finish it, I was so...

29:29.500 --> 29:31.900
She wants me to come in
there and read it to her.

29:32.400 --> 29:33.200
Okay.

29:33.500 --> 29:34.400
Okay? What...?

29:34.900 --> 29:36.600
You really think this is okay, Al?

29:36.800 --> 29:37.500
I don't know.

29:37.600 --> 29:40.700
I don't think I should be doing
anything to encourage all this.

29:40.800 --> 29:41.800
All what?

29:42.000 --> 29:44.900
If you really believe this came from
the woman who wrote the Danielle books,

29:45.100 --> 29:47.800
how lovely, how flattering

29:48.600 --> 29:52.600
she heard our child's plea for more,
and she chose to answer it.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.800
Uh... If you can't get your head
around that, that's fine, too.

29:56.100 --> 29:58.600
All it means is that Bridgette is precocious.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.600
She took the three books that she loved,

30:01.700 --> 30:03.100
and she wrote one for herself.

30:03.600 --> 30:04.600
Either way...

30:04.800 --> 30:07.800
Wait a second. You really think that
Bridgette might have come up with this herself?

30:07.900 --> 30:09.400
Kids have done crazier things.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.700
Hell, maybe that's what inspiration is.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.800
Some original thought, and some desire,

30:17.400 --> 30:21.600
and a willingness to listen to the voices
of the people who came before us,

30:22.000 --> 30:25.100
whispering to us, and encouraging us.

30:26.700 --> 30:28.600
Why are you looking at me like that?

30:29.400 --> 30:30.900
You think I'm crazy, right?

30:30.900 --> 30:31.900
No.

30:32.900 --> 30:34.400
I think you're brilliant.

30:35.300 --> 30:36.700
I think you're beautiful.

30:37.600 --> 30:38.700
I know you're crazy.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.700
And I've learned there's no point in arguing

30:41.000 --> 30:42.600
with a crazy person.

30:44.500 --> 30:45.400
Where are you going?

30:45.500 --> 30:46.600
I'm going to read to Bridgette.

30:46.700 --> 30:47.800
I'll read to Bridgette.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.700
I need you to look at something.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.600
Some stuff I brought from office.

30:53.900 --> 30:55.100
Okay. What is this?

30:55.200 --> 30:56.400
It's math, I think.

30:56.500 --> 30:57.300
You think?

30:57.400 --> 31:01.000
I think, like you think I'm beautiful.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.400
"Danielle was happy once more.

31:03.700 --> 31:06.300
"Someone new had moved in next door.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.400
"Ariel was her name.

31:13.100 --> 31:15.700
"She had great toys and games.

31:16.900 --> 31:19.500
Danielle would be lonely no more."

31:21.100 --> 31:22.500
Yay.

31:22.600 --> 31:23.900
You read that really good, Mommy.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.500
Almost as good as Daddy.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.000
Thank you, honey.

31:30.800 --> 31:31.900
So, Ariel, huh?

31:32.000 --> 31:34.500
She's the one that
makes Danielle feel better?

31:34.900 --> 31:37.300
Yeah. Well, it's a pretty common name, Mom.

31:37.500 --> 31:38.400
Mm.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.200
I'm sorry that I yelled at
you for using Daddy's computer.

31:44.500 --> 31:46.700
But it's Daddy's,
and we shouldn't play with it.

31:47.600 --> 31:48.700
But maybe tomorrow,

31:48.900 --> 31:51.900
I could take you to the family room
and show you how to use that one.

31:52.100 --> 31:56.600
I mean, in case there's another story
a writer wants you to put down.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.200
That would be really great, Mommy,

31:59.200 --> 32:02.200
'cause I'm hearing stories
in my head all the time.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.000
I bet you are.

32:04.800 --> 32:05.800
Give me a kiss.

32:07.700 --> 32:09.300
Thank you for the sugar.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.500
Oh, no, Joe. It's worse than we thought.

32:18.600 --> 32:21.000
Not only might she be a Touch Psychic,

32:21.400 --> 32:23.500
I fear deeply that she may be...

32:24.200 --> 32:26.200
creative.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.600
You didn't find another one, did you?

32:30.700 --> 32:32.300
Come here, I want to show you something.

32:34.700 --> 32:36.300
What am I looking at?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.600
Wait a second, I've seen one
of those before. What is that?

32:41.000 --> 32:42.600
It's called a pass code generator.

32:42.900 --> 32:44.800
It's used with secure computer networks--

32:44.900 --> 32:47.500
the kind that big corporations
with lots of sensitive data have,

32:47.600 --> 32:48.900
like banks and investment houses.

32:49.000 --> 32:49.800
Okay...

32:49.900 --> 32:53.100
Right, so let's say that you want to let your
employees use the Internet to access your network

32:53.200 --> 32:56.000
from home or when they're on the road.

32:56.300 --> 32:58.800
Obviously, you're going to want
to secure things with a password,

32:58.900 --> 33:01.300
a password that's going
to change relatively frequently.

33:01.300 --> 33:04.300
Now, what happens is, that every
few minutes or so, the company server

33:04.400 --> 33:07.200
sends out a page to
everybody's pager or cell phone.

33:07.300 --> 33:09.800
Wow, this sounds terribly familiar.

33:09.800 --> 33:13.000
Now, to guard against anybody
intercepting the page or the text message,

33:13.100 --> 33:14.000
they issue everyone...

33:14.100 --> 33:15.100
- One of these.
- One of these.

33:15.200 --> 33:15.800
Sorry.

33:16.200 --> 33:19.200
Right. There's a program
that's hard-wired into this thing

33:19.300 --> 33:21.500
that runs a series of fancy
mathematical transformations,

33:21.700 --> 33:23.300
ultimately kicking out the new password.

33:23.700 --> 33:25.500
The new password... the real password?

33:26.200 --> 33:28.100
For banks, financial institutions?

33:28.200 --> 33:30.100
Well, that's what this
particular model is for, yeah.

33:30.300 --> 33:31.700
Of course, if you don't have one of these,

33:31.800 --> 33:34.900
and you happen to be a friggin' genius,
then you can also do all of this.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.200
You just lost me.

33:36.300 --> 33:37.800
Well, all of this...

33:39.500 --> 33:40.600
equals that.

33:40.600 --> 33:44.100
Okay, one more time for those of us
who had to repeat math in summer school.

33:44.300 --> 33:45.700
He was calculating pass codes.

33:47.000 --> 33:47.800
What do you mean ?

33:47.900 --> 33:51.400
He was doing the same thing tha
 that little gadget does, only by hand.

33:52.600 --> 33:57.500
So someone, somewhere, could get into a compute
that they otherwise couldn't get into.

33:57.600 --> 33:58.600
Presumably.

34:02.200 --> 34:04.100
Were you just saying something
to me about Bridgette?

34:04.800 --> 34:06.000
Oh... yeah.

34:07.400 --> 34:09.600
Yeah, wherever that story came from,

34:09.600 --> 34:11.400
I really don't think it came to her whole.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.900
There is a lot of Bridgette in it.

34:16.100 --> 34:17.800
I think she's just smart.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.300
Like her dad.

34:21.500 --> 34:22.199
Mm.

34:31.199 --> 34:33.100
Hey, wait a second, where you going?

34:34.100 --> 34:35.300
That was just getting good.

34:42.900 --> 34:43.699
Jessica.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.699
When your brother first fell
to his death in Los Angeles,

34:46.800 --> 34:50.400
after the local authorities
were able to identify him,

34:50.500 --> 34:54.000
they all assumed...
we all assumed--

34:54.100 --> 34:55.900
given his history of mental problems,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.200
that his death was self-inflicted.

34:58.300 --> 34:59.800
That he simply jumped.

35:01.400 --> 35:06.000
But since then, some new evidence has come
to light that would seem to suggest that...

35:06.100 --> 35:07.700
he was pushed off that roof.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.000
Very much against his will.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.400
I'm sorry, what are we looking at here?

35:22.500 --> 35:25.400
Financial statements from an investment
account under your wife's name

35:25.500 --> 35:27.200
at the firm of Wilke and Price.

35:27.900 --> 35:29.900
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

35:30.400 --> 35:33.700
Did you not just tell me you suspect
that my brother was murdered?

35:33.900 --> 35:37.100
What could that possibly have to do
with my financial statements?

35:37.200 --> 35:39.700
I assure you,
we believe there is a connection.

35:39.800 --> 35:43.100
Well, I certainly hope that's true,
these records are private.

35:43.100 --> 35:45.800
When I discover how they came
to be in your possession...

35:45.900 --> 35:46.500
David.

35:47.300 --> 35:50.300
Those documents were
provided to us by Wilke and Price.

35:50.500 --> 35:55.600
They were more than willing to cooperate once we
alerted them to the possible irregularities in the account.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.800
What irregularities?

35:58.100 --> 36:02.700
As you can see, the account was
opened with an initial deposit of $50,000.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.700
Today, barely eight months later...

36:06.700 --> 36:08.200
it's worth over four million.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.800
That's quite a rate of return,
wouldn't you say?

36:14.400 --> 36:16.300
I-I don't know what to tell you.

36:16.800 --> 36:20.700
My husband is very gifted
when it comes to making money.

36:20.900 --> 36:22.400
He just is.

36:23.100 --> 36:26.500
But I still don't understand what
any of this had to do with my brother.

36:26.600 --> 36:30.500
We ch cked with your investment firme
and we discovered the damndest thing.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.200
At 4:01 Eastern time, right after
the markets closed on Wall Street,

36:35.300 --> 36:39.200
whoever was handling your account
would electronically access your holdings

36:39.300 --> 36:41.700
and change them to reflect
the day's winners.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.000
Add some gainers, drop some losers.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.000
Pretty good investment strategy...

36:46.600 --> 36:47.900
if you can get away with it.

36:50.200 --> 36:51.500
Well, I'm baffled.

36:53.900 --> 36:56.800
Darling, have you been reading your
statements when they come in the mail?

37:04.500 --> 37:08.400
I don't know whether the bank has made
some kind of mistake in our favor or,

37:08.800 --> 37:13.400
as you say, for some reason
somebody did... do something...But,

37:13.400 --> 37:17.300
either way, the money isn't ours and,
naturally, we'll return it.

37:18.900 --> 37:20.200
That's very big of you.

37:20.300 --> 37:22.600
No, absolutely,
that's the right thing to do.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.100
It's the only thing to do.

37:24.500 --> 37:26.900
You were once an employee
of Wilke and Price, weren't you.

37:27.600 --> 37:29.900
Yes, as a Senior Vice President, why?

37:30.900 --> 37:33.700
None of you are suggesting
that I had anything to do with this?

37:35.900 --> 37:37.000
That's absurd.

37:37.400 --> 37:41.700
Even if I wanted to manipulate my wife's 
ccount, how was I going to go about it?

37:42.100 --> 37:44.000
I had no access to it.

37:44.100 --> 37:45.600
I was no longer with the company.

37:45.700 --> 37:46.900
Wouldn't be that tough.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.000
Not if you had one of these.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.100
Yes, but I don't.

37:53.300 --> 37:57.800
When I left the firm,
I surrendered my pass-code device.

37:57.900 --> 38:00.900
So you see, your theory makes no sense.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.400
Unless, of course, you happened to have a
brother-in-law with the mathematical, skills necessary

38:04.500 --> 38:09.500
to defeat the security safeguards that the
pass code generator was designed to protect.

38:09.600 --> 38:11.900
A brother-in-law who
could be easily manipulated.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.900
Who could be led to believe that
he wasn't involved in anything illegal.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
That, in fact,

38:16.500 --> 38:18.900
he was essential to
the security of this country.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.200
But what do you do with a guy like that?

38:20.300 --> 38:22.300
A relative? A guy who might talk?

38:22.300 --> 38:25.300
Maybe you could tell him that the
government has a new assignment for him

38:25.600 --> 38:26.800
in Los Angeles.

38:26.900 --> 38:29.000
Book him a room at the hotel,

38:29.100 --> 38:30.700
make sure that he spends
enough time there

38:30.800 --> 38:32.700
so that everybody sees
him talking to himself,

38:32.900 --> 38:34.100
behaving strangely.

38:34.200 --> 38:36.200
So that when he ends up
a puddle on the sidewalk,

38:37.200 --> 38:38.700
they don't even question why.

38:40.700 --> 38:42.500
Darling, this isn't true.

38:42.700 --> 38:43.900
None of this' true.

38:51.700 --> 38:54.500
I have nothing further
to say until I speak with my lawyer.

38:54.600 --> 38:55.700
That won't be a problem.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.600
Actually, I have him waiting outside.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.400
I'll bring him in.

39:10.900 --> 39:12.600
Pardon me, sir?

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Are you're David Delany's attorney?

39:15.100 --> 39:15.900
Yes, I am.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.900
Well, they'd like you to step inside now.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.900
Oh, really? And you are?

39:21.400 --> 39:22.400
Allison.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.400
Allison Dubois.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.400
Have we met before?

39:30.900 --> 39:33.200
No. I don't believe we have.

39:34.300 --> 39:37.300
I have to go pick up my kids, but you
could go through the door right there.

39:39.900 --> 39:41.000
Oh, sir?

39:42.800 --> 39:44.000
Just one more thing.

39:44.100 --> 39:45.900
Uh, they'll probably arrest you.

39:46.200 --> 39:47.400
Just a heads up.

39:59.300 --> 40:00.600
Very well done.

40:03.100 --> 40:04.200
Thank you.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.300
How are you doing?

40:06.900 --> 40:08.700
Good, I think.

40:09.300 --> 40:10.700
Better all the time.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.500
Still worried about my sister.

40:15.700 --> 40:16.900
But good.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.600
Feeling a little silly
for looking like this.

40:23.800 --> 40:26.500
Maybe the next time we meet...

40:27.100 --> 40:28.300
I'll...

40:30.300 --> 40:32.000
look more like myself.

40:32.700 --> 40:34.600
I'll look forward to that.

40:38.700 --> 40:44.200
