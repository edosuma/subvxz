WEBVTT

00:02.035 --> 00:04.059
Last time
on Star Trek: Voyager...

00:04.137 --> 00:05.570
My god.

00:08.108 --> 00:10.975
We don't know exactly
how many vessels are out there,

00:11.044 --> 00:13.478
but their space
appears to be vast.

00:13.546 --> 00:16.207
lt includes thousands
of solar systems--

00:16.282 --> 00:17.943
all Borg.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.316
We are, no doubt, entering
the heart of their territory.

00:20.387 --> 00:22.150
Captain, l'm detecting

00:22.222 --> 00:24.554
two residual weapon signatures
in the debris.

00:24.624 --> 00:25.852
One is Borg.

00:25.925 --> 00:28.917
The other is of unknown origin.

00:28.995 --> 00:31.623
l'd like to know what kind of
weapon could destroy the Borg.

00:34.901 --> 00:38.462
They refer to these new
aliens as"Species 8472."

00:38.538 --> 00:40.506
Captain, it's not the Borg
that we should be worried about.

00:40.573 --> 00:41.767
lt's them.

00:41.841 --> 00:45.402
The alien cells are consuming
his body from the inside out.

00:45.478 --> 00:47.173
ln developing a treatment
for Harry,

00:47.247 --> 00:49.511
the Doctor has found a way
to attack the aliens

00:49.582 --> 00:50.708
at a microscopic level.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.547
An alliance with the Borg?

00:52.619 --> 00:55.417
More like...an exchange.

00:55.488 --> 00:58.651
We offer them a way
to defeat their new enemy

00:58.725 --> 01:01.489
and, in return,
we get safe passage

01:01.561 --> 01:03.085
through their space.

01:05.098 --> 01:07.362
State your demands.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:18.211 --> 01:19.644
Can you get a lock
on the Captain?

01:19.712 --> 01:21.077
Not yet.

01:26.986 --> 01:28.578
And now, the conclusion.

01:31.758 --> 01:32.918
Report.

01:32.992 --> 01:34.823
The Borg shields are off- line.

01:34.894 --> 01:36.361
l've got a lock
on Captain Janeway.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.454
Get her out of there
and break us free of the cube.

01:38.531 --> 01:39.623
Stand by all weapons.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.424
l'm trying to energize.

01:43.536 --> 01:45.231
The Borg are scattering
the beam.

01:45.305 --> 01:46.363
Compensate.

01:48.708 --> 01:50.005
No effect.

01:50.076 --> 01:51.441
We're being hailed.

01:51.511 --> 01:52.773
On screen.

01:52.846 --> 01:55.747
Commander,
cut the transporter beam.

01:55.815 --> 01:57.248
Captain?

01:57.317 --> 01:58.545
Do it.

02:00.019 --> 02:02.749
l have reached an agreement
with the collective.

02:02.856 --> 02:07.520
We're going to help them design
a weapon against Species 8472.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.925
ln exchange, they've granted us

02:09.996 --> 02:12.157
safe passage
through their space.

02:12.232 --> 02:13.529
Cube is altering course.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.397
They're heading toward
the Alpha Quadrant.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.901
That's part of the plan.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.165
We'll work on the weapon
en route.

02:19.239 --> 02:20.706
Once we're across
their territory,

02:20.773 --> 02:22.968
we'll give them the nanoprobes.

02:23.042 --> 02:25.510
They appear to be holding up
their end of the bargain.

02:25.578 --> 02:26.977
l suggest we do the same.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.072
How do you propose
we begin this"collaboration"?

02:30.150 --> 02:32.618
l'm going to work here
on the cube.

02:32.685 --> 02:34.983
They have technology
that'll make the job go faster.

02:35.054 --> 02:36.453
l want to take advantage of it.

02:36.523 --> 02:38.354
lt's not necessary
for you to stay there.

02:38.424 --> 02:39.857
We can set up a com- link
with the Borg...

02:39.926 --> 02:40.858
lt's part of the deal.

02:40.927 --> 02:42.588
l work here.

02:44.030 --> 02:45.054
All right.

02:46.266 --> 02:47.733
As long as we're cooperating...

02:49.335 --> 02:52.395
maybe the Borg would be willing
to disengage their tractor beam.

02:52.472 --> 02:54.406
We can match their course
without a leash.

02:54.474 --> 02:55.771
l'll propose it.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.673
Mr. Tuvok, transport
to my coordinates.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.507
Understood.

02:59.579 --> 03:00.978
We're going to make this work,
Commander.

03:01.047 --> 03:02.139
Janeway out.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.015
You heard the Captain.

05:06.873 --> 05:10.570
l've replicated nearly ten
million Borg nanoprobes,

05:10.643 --> 05:12.907
each of them reprogrammed
to my specifications,

05:12.979 --> 05:15.573
each capable
of targeting the alien tissue.

05:16.949 --> 05:18.348
Assimilating it?

05:18.418 --> 05:20.249
Just momentarily.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.084
The Borg technology will
denaturate within seconds

05:23.156 --> 05:24.680
taking the alien tissue
along with it.

05:28.761 --> 05:32.629
Mr. Kim, l'm about
to inject your carotid artery.

05:32.699 --> 05:34.291
You'll feel
a tingling sensation.

05:34.367 --> 05:35.527
Don't be alarmed.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.151
Nice to see you again, Ensign.

06:00.226 --> 06:01.523
lt's working.

06:01.594 --> 06:02.822
Prepare another dose
of nanoprobes.

06:02.895 --> 06:03.953
Yes, Doctor.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.657
Good work.

06:05.732 --> 06:07.324
Let me know when he's
back on his feet.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.664
Commander, l must tell you,

06:09.736 --> 06:11.863
l have my doubts
about this alliance.

06:11.938 --> 06:13.599
You may have convinced the Borg

06:13.673 --> 06:15.607
the nanoprobes
can defeat their enemy,

06:15.675 --> 06:16.642
but a medical treatment

06:16.709 --> 06:18.233
is a long way
from a weapon of war.

06:18.311 --> 06:19.676
We'll leave that to the Captain.

06:19.746 --> 06:22.374
This situation is unpredictable,

06:22.448 --> 06:24.006
so we're going to stay
at full Red Alert.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.914
Keep all information
about the nanoprobes

06:26.018 --> 06:27.645
stored in your holo- matrix.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.085
Don't worry.
l'll delete myself

06:29.155 --> 06:30.486
at the first sign of trouble.

06:30.556 --> 06:33.354
Well...maybe not
the first sign.

06:42.602 --> 06:44.331
We've just received word.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.530
Tuvok beamed to the cube.

06:45.605 --> 06:46.697
He's joined the Captain.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.764
Keep a transporter lock
on both of them.

06:48.841 --> 06:49.808
l'll try, but the Borg

06:49.876 --> 06:51.343
are already regenerating
their shields.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.878
Try matching
their shield frequencies.

06:52.945 --> 06:53.877
lt won't work.

06:53.946 --> 06:55.140
They'll be able
to adapt too quickly.

06:55.214 --> 06:56.977
l don't want to hear what we
can't do, Lieutenant!

06:57.049 --> 06:58.243
Just find a way
to get our people

06:58.317 --> 06:59.341
out of there if we have to.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.647
Aye, sir.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.954
They've released
their tractor beam.

07:05.024 --> 07:08.050
Match their course and speed.

07:08.127 --> 07:10.823
l never thought l'd hear
myself say this, but...

07:10.897 --> 07:12.888
looks like the Borg
are cooperating.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.496
Kes, Kes!

07:50.570 --> 07:51.298
Kes!

07:51.370 --> 07:53.065
What's wrong?

07:53.139 --> 07:55.630
They're watching us.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.580
May l ask
where we're being taken?

08:02.648 --> 08:04.843
Grid nine- two
of subjunction 12--

08:04.917 --> 08:05.849
our very own workspace.

08:05.918 --> 08:07.215
lt's near the center
of the cube.

08:07.286 --> 08:09.550
These are my tricorder readings
of the bioship we examined.

08:09.622 --> 08:12.591
l believe you will find
them most revealing.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.683
Have you compared this
to the Doctor's analysis

08:14.760 --> 08:16.955
of the alien tissue?

08:17.029 --> 08:19.827
Yes. Many of the cellular
structures are identical.

08:19.899 --> 08:21.833
The aliens and their ships
are made of the same

08:21.901 --> 08:23.198
organic material.

08:23.269 --> 08:24.327
Apparently so.

08:27.406 --> 08:32.342
You have entered grid nine- two
of subjunction 12.

08:32.410 --> 08:33.741
Proceed.

08:35.548 --> 08:36.879
All right.

08:38.217 --> 08:41.015
We've analyzed one
of the alien vessels

08:41.087 --> 08:45.046
and it appears to be constructed
of organic material

08:45.124 --> 08:47.684
vulnerable
to the modified nanoprobes.

08:49.295 --> 08:51.058
l suggest we begin thinking

08:51.130 --> 08:53.462
about a large- scale
delivery system--

08:53.533 --> 08:54.761
a way to infect their ships

08:54.834 --> 08:56.392
and destroy them
at the microsc...

08:57.436 --> 08:59.063
We will begin.

08:59.138 --> 09:00.901
What are you doing?

09:00.973 --> 09:03.999
A neuro- transceiver is required
for maximum communication.

09:04.076 --> 09:06.738
We will work as one mind.

09:06.812 --> 09:08.404
No, that wasn't the agreement.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.039
The neural link is temporary.

09:10.116 --> 09:12.346
You will not be damaged.

09:12.418 --> 09:13.544
l don't care.

09:13.619 --> 09:15.450
l prefer to communicate
verbally, thank you.

09:15.521 --> 09:18.456
Your primitive communication
is inefficient.

09:18.524 --> 09:19.855
On the contrary...

09:19.926 --> 09:23.259
we work better
with our individuality intact.

09:23.329 --> 09:25.820
Surely, we've proven that
to you by now.

09:25.898 --> 09:28.867
lrrelevant.
You must comply.

09:29.001 --> 09:30.263
We"must" do nothing.

09:30.336 --> 09:33.669
Tell your drone
to remove the transceiver.

09:39.145 --> 09:41.909
What about choosing
a representative--

09:42.014 --> 09:45.347
a single Borg we can work with
and talk to directly?

09:45.418 --> 09:46.510
Elaborate.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.144
You've done it before

09:48.220 --> 09:51.087
when you transformed
Jean- Luc Picard into Locutus.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.523
We will not be assimilated.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.585
Choose a representative,
or the deal's off!

10:31.130 --> 10:33.462
l speak for the Borg.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.536
l'm Captain Janeway.

10:39.605 --> 10:40.970
This is Lieutenant Tuvok.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.099
We are aware
of your designations.

10:43.175 --> 10:45.166
What's your designation?

10:45.244 --> 10:47.041
Seven of Nine,

10:47.113 --> 10:50.014
Tertiary Adjunct
of Unimatrix Zero One.

10:50.082 --> 10:52.915
But you may call me
Seven of Nine.

10:55.521 --> 10:58.388
You are proposing
a large- scale weapon.

10:58.457 --> 10:59.719
We concur.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.089
l thought you might.

11:01.193 --> 11:04.959
We could encase the nanoprobes
in some of our photon torpedoes

11:04.997 --> 11:07.898
in essence, turn them
into biomolecular warheads.

11:07.967 --> 11:10.561
Your torpedoes are inadequate.

11:10.636 --> 11:13.469
They lack the necessary range
and dispersive force.

11:13.539 --> 11:15.302
Do you have a better idea?

11:16.509 --> 11:17.567
We are Borg.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.313
l take that as a"yes."

11:32.124 --> 11:35.150
A multikinetic neutronic mine--

11:35.227 --> 11:37.491
five million isoton yield.

11:37.563 --> 11:38.495
An explosion that size

11:38.564 --> 11:40.293
could affect
an entire star system.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.924
Correct.

11:42.001 --> 11:44.834
The shock wave will disperse
the nanoprobes over a radius

11:44.904 --> 11:45.871
of five light- years.

11:45.938 --> 11:48.907
That's somewhat larger
than l had in mind.

11:48.974 --> 11:51.602
You're proposing a weapon
of mass destruction.

11:51.677 --> 11:53.269
We are.

11:53.345 --> 11:55.040
Well, l'm not.

11:55.114 --> 11:57.048
You'd be endangering
innocent worlds.

11:57.149 --> 11:58.946
lt would be efficient.

11:59.018 --> 12:01.384
We would need approximately
50 trillion nanoprobes

12:01.454 --> 12:02.819
to arm this mine.

12:02.888 --> 12:03.912
lt would take the Doctor

12:03.989 --> 12:05.752
several weeks
to replicate that amount.

12:05.825 --> 12:07.656
You are losing this conflict.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.922
Are you willing
to risk further delay?

12:09.995 --> 12:13.726
Right now, your enemy
believes it is invulnerable.

12:13.799 --> 12:17.735
lf we create smaller weapons
using our torpedoes,

12:17.803 --> 12:20.567
and destroy
a few of their bioships

12:20.639 --> 12:21.970
it may deter them,

12:22.041 --> 12:24.066
convince them
to give up this war.

12:24.143 --> 12:27.135
You are individuals.

12:27.213 --> 12:31.013
You are small
and you think in small terms.

12:38.657 --> 12:41.285
But the present
situation requires

12:41.360 --> 12:43.021
that we consider your plan.

12:49.568 --> 12:51.934
Voyager's weapons inventory.

12:52.004 --> 12:56.202
Photon torpedo complement-- 32,
class- 6 warhead.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.709
Explosive yield-- 200 isotons.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.643
How did you obtain
this information?

13:02.448 --> 13:03.881
We are Borg.

13:05.985 --> 13:07.282
Naturally.

13:23.235 --> 13:25.635
Commander, we have
some disturbing news.

13:25.704 --> 13:27.103
At this point,
l'm getting used to it.

13:27.173 --> 13:29.471
Her telepathic visions
are increasing,

13:29.542 --> 13:31.567
both in frequency and intensity.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.236
lt feels different this time.

13:33.312 --> 13:39.308
lt's almost like...
they're right here in the room.

13:39.385 --> 13:40.977
There it is again.

13:41.053 --> 13:43.487
l'm trying to block them out...

13:43.556 --> 13:45.524
but l can't.

13:48.294 --> 13:51.127
Every time she has a vision,
specific regions

13:51.197 --> 13:52.255
of her cerebral cortex

13:52.331 --> 13:54.162
go into a state
of hyper- stimulation--

13:54.233 --> 13:56.599
memory engrams,
perceptual centers.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.796
l can't be sure, but l think
there's more going on here

13:58.871 --> 13:59.963
than just a simple"hello."

14:04.109 --> 14:05.076
Enhance this grid.

14:05.144 --> 14:07.169
l want to take a closer look
at the detonator.

14:11.217 --> 14:13.515
We must analyze the bioship.

14:13.586 --> 14:14.746
Your data.

14:31.403 --> 14:33.268
You're human, aren't you?

14:33.339 --> 14:35.933
This body was assimilated
18 years ago.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.271
lt ceased to be human
at that time.

14:38.344 --> 14:40.244
l'm curious.
What was your name before...?

14:40.312 --> 14:43.008
Do not engage us
in further irrelevant discourse.

14:44.683 --> 14:47.481
We are being hailed
by your vessel.

14:52.358 --> 14:53.586
Commander, what is it?

14:53.659 --> 14:54.921
lt's Kes.

14:54.994 --> 14:55.926
The Doctor believes

14:55.995 --> 14:57.622
that the aliens
are accessing her memory.

14:57.696 --> 14:58.628
lf that's true,

14:58.697 --> 15:01.029
they may already know
what we're planning.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.432
l've ordered long- range scans
for bioships.

15:03.502 --> 15:04.469
Nothing so far.

15:04.536 --> 15:07.562
We should alter course,
try to throw them off.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.607
Agreed.

15:11.377 --> 15:14.312
Our course and heading
have been changed.

15:14.380 --> 15:17.907
Match them and keep me apprised
of any changes in Kes.

15:18.017 --> 15:19.006
Chakotay out.

15:20.386 --> 15:22.911
We now require
one of your photon torpedoes

15:22.988 --> 15:24.080
and the nanoprobes.

15:24.156 --> 15:25.555
One step at a time.

15:25.624 --> 15:28.092
We're not safely across
your territory yet.

15:28.160 --> 15:32.096
We must construct
and test a prototype now.

15:32.164 --> 15:33.392
The risk of attack
has increased.

15:33.465 --> 15:34.397
lrrelevant.

15:34.466 --> 15:35.728
We have an agreement.

15:35.801 --> 15:37.928
You're asking me
to give up my only guarantee

15:38.003 --> 15:39.470
that you won't assimilate us.

15:39.538 --> 15:40.664
l won't risk it.

15:40.739 --> 15:44.402
Are you willing to risk
a direct confrontation with us?

15:45.945 --> 15:49.972
lf we transport
500 drones onto your vessel,

15:50.049 --> 15:52.984
do you believe you could offer
sufficient resistance?

15:53.085 --> 15:55.144
We'd die trying.

15:57.423 --> 15:59.857
That won't be necessary.

15:59.925 --> 16:01.324
We must construct
a launching system

16:01.427 --> 16:03.019
to accommodate this design.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.832
Glad you could join us, Mr. Kim.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.393
Harry, welcome back.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.371
Thanks.
Reporting for duty, sir.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.203
The Doctor gave me
a clean bill of health.

16:16.275 --> 16:17.867
Did l miss anything?

16:18.010 --> 16:20.205
Not too much.

16:20.279 --> 16:21.337
Take your station, Ensign.

16:27.419 --> 16:30.115
You've still got a tendril
up your nose.

16:31.290 --> 16:34.453
Commander, l'm picking up
gravimetric distortions.

16:34.526 --> 16:35.925
12, 000 kilometers aft.

16:36.028 --> 16:38.690
lt's a singularity.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.732
We are under attack.

16:47.806 --> 16:48.898
They're charging weapons.

16:48.974 --> 16:50.202
Shields.

16:50.275 --> 16:51.333
Keep a lock on the away team.

16:53.045 --> 16:54.979
Direct hit
to our secondary hull.

16:56.148 --> 16:57.206
Transporters are off- line.

16:57.282 --> 16:58.749
Shields and weapons are down.

17:04.256 --> 17:06.247
Voyager has taken heavy damage.

17:06.325 --> 17:09.192
We cannot let the nanoprobes
be destroyed.

17:11.195 --> 17:12.560
We're being targeted.

17:12.631 --> 17:13.655
Brace for impact.

17:35.621 --> 17:37.521
The cube?

17:37.589 --> 17:40.251
Destroyed...and it took
the bioship with it.

17:40.325 --> 17:42.885
Tuvok to Chakotay.

17:42.961 --> 17:44.553
Go ahead, Tuvok.
Where are you?

17:44.630 --> 17:46.291
l'm in Cargo Bay 2...

17:48.033 --> 17:50.763
along with the Captain...

17:50.836 --> 17:53.168
and a number of Borg.

17:53.238 --> 17:56.765
We were beamed over
just before impact.

17:56.842 --> 17:58.935
We require assistance.

18:00.012 --> 18:02.981
Tuvok? Tuvok?

18:03.015 --> 18:04.846
Secure that deck.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.714
Security team to Cargo Bay 2.

18:06.785 --> 18:08.776
Paris, you have the Bridge.

18:39.017 --> 18:41.076
Lower your weapons.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.486
We are here
with your Captain's consent.

18:47.559 --> 18:51.757
lt was necessary to sacrifice
our vessel to protect yours.

18:58.036 --> 19:00.937
We have an alliance, do we not?

19:06.345 --> 19:07.676
For now, they're contained.

19:07.746 --> 19:09.145
They've assimilated Cargo Bay 2

19:09.214 --> 19:11.842
and are drawing energy from
the secondary power couplings.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.646
But they've gone no further?

19:13.719 --> 19:15.846
Not yet.
l've sealed off Decks 9

19:15.921 --> 19:18.754
through 13 and posted security
details at every access point.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.691
l suggest we increase security
around Sick Bay as well.

19:21.760 --> 19:22.727
Already done.

19:22.794 --> 19:24.557
How far did you get
on the weapon?

19:24.630 --> 19:26.120
We are ready
to construct a prototype.

19:26.198 --> 19:28.166
You're fit to return
back to duty, Lieutenant.

19:29.768 --> 19:31.668
And you, Kes?

19:31.737 --> 19:32.704
Oh, l'm all right.

19:32.771 --> 19:34.602
The visions
have stopped for now.

19:40.245 --> 19:43.214
The plasma burns to her
thoracic region l can treat

19:43.282 --> 19:45.375
and l've already stopped
the internal bleeding,

19:45.450 --> 19:47.918
but her neural injuries
are going to require some...

19:47.986 --> 19:49.317
creative thinking.

19:49.388 --> 19:50.855
Before we beamed out,

19:50.923 --> 19:53.824
an alien energy discharge
struck very near the Captain.

19:53.892 --> 19:55.291
Well, it appears to have
disrupted

19:55.360 --> 19:57.351
all her neuroelectrical
pathways.

19:57.429 --> 19:58.623
l'll have to induce a coma

19:58.697 --> 20:00.494
to protect
her higher brain functions,

20:00.566 --> 20:04.024
but l must tell you, unless
l can repair the damage...

20:04.102 --> 20:06.570
she may never
regain consciousness.

20:08.273 --> 20:09.763
Make sure those Borg stay put.

20:09.841 --> 20:11.638
l want tactical updates
every 20 minutes.

20:11.710 --> 20:12.768
Aye, sir.

20:12.844 --> 20:14.311
Shall l resume working
with them?

20:14.379 --> 20:15.869
Stand by for now.

20:15.948 --> 20:18.314
The Captain wishes
to speak with you.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.816
Please keep it brief.

20:28.694 --> 20:31.288
The Doctor...

20:31.363 --> 20:34.526
explained my condition.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.194
You are in command.

20:37.269 --> 20:39.032
l understand.

20:40.305 --> 20:42.273
They'll push you...

20:42.341 --> 20:44.536
they'll threaten you,

20:44.610 --> 20:47.579
but they need you.

20:47.646 --> 20:50.274
They need this alliance.

20:54.019 --> 20:57.455
You have to make this work.

20:57.522 --> 21:03.654
l want you to make this work.

21:03.729 --> 21:07.790
Get this crew home.

21:10.335 --> 21:11.529
l must begin.

21:58.550 --> 22:00.450
Where is your Captain?

22:00.519 --> 22:01.781
l must speak with her.

22:01.853 --> 22:03.787
ln our medical bay,
recovering.

22:03.855 --> 22:06.585
You'll be dealing with me now.

22:06.658 --> 22:09.252
Circumstances have changed.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.488
l'd say so.

22:10.562 --> 22:14.054
The loss of our vessel requires
that we modify our agreement.

22:14.132 --> 22:16.726
l've been giving that
some thought.

22:16.802 --> 22:19.771
l'm willing
to let you stay on board.

22:19.838 --> 22:22.170
We'll continue to work
with you on the weapon.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.765
Once we're safely out
of Borg territory,

22:24.843 --> 22:28.802
we'll give you the nanoprobes,
shake hands and part company.

22:30.048 --> 22:32.073
lnsufficient.

22:32.150 --> 22:34.175
Our latest tactical
projections indicate

22:34.252 --> 22:36.277
that the war
will be lost by then.

22:38.490 --> 22:41.618
The nearest Borg vessel
is 40 light- years away.

22:41.693 --> 22:44.992
You will reverse course
and take us to it.

22:45.063 --> 22:47.759
Even at maximum warp,
that's a five- day journey--

22:47.833 --> 22:49.198
in the wrong direction.

22:49.267 --> 22:51.497
We're supposed to be
heading out of Borg space

22:51.570 --> 22:52.935
not deeper into it.

22:53.004 --> 22:54.471
There is no alternative.

22:54.539 --> 22:55.506
Look...

22:55.574 --> 22:57.667
l'll honor
the original agreement,

22:57.743 --> 22:59.267
but l'm not turning
this ship around.

22:59.344 --> 23:00.777
lt's too dangerous.

23:03.115 --> 23:07.279
Denying our request
is also dangerous.

23:08.787 --> 23:10.516
l'll think about it.

23:10.589 --> 23:12.079
Think quickly.

23:18.296 --> 23:21.595
A five- day trip back into
the heart of Borg territory--

23:21.666 --> 23:23.930
it's too risky.

23:24.002 --> 23:26.232
With those drones
and the nanoprobes on board,

23:26.304 --> 23:29.068
we might as well have a
bull's- eye painted on our hull.

23:29.141 --> 23:32.599
We're a prime target
for Species 8472.

23:32.677 --> 23:34.440
We'd never survive
another attack.

23:34.513 --> 23:36.640
What is the alternative?

23:36.715 --> 23:39.707
l'm going to end this alliance,
here and now.

23:39.785 --> 23:42.913
We're going to drop the Borg off
on the next uninhabited planet,

23:42.988 --> 23:45.684
give them the nanoprobes
and take our chances alone.

23:45.757 --> 23:47.554
They can wait for a Borg ship
to pick them up

23:47.626 --> 23:48.854
and finish the weapon.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.258
l'm in command now and l

23:50.328 --> 23:52.660
have to do what l think
is best for this crew.

23:52.731 --> 23:53.789
Tom, l want you to scan

23:53.865 --> 23:56.333
for the nearest uninhabited
planet and set a course.

23:56.401 --> 23:57.333
Aye, sir.

23:57.402 --> 23:59.495
l must caution you, Commander.

23:59.571 --> 24:01.505
The Borg may not go quietly.

24:01.606 --> 24:02.937
We'll see.

24:02.974 --> 24:05.499
Bring that female drone
to the ready room.

24:05.577 --> 24:06.737
Dismissed.

24:09.881 --> 24:12.076
Once we've beamed
you to the surface,

24:12.150 --> 24:14.345
we'll send down the nanoprobes
and all our research.

24:14.419 --> 24:15.716
Unacceptable.

24:15.787 --> 24:16.913
We don't have time...

24:16.988 --> 24:18.478
This isn't open for discussion.

24:18.557 --> 24:20.354
l'm not turning
this ship around.

24:21.660 --> 24:23.491
You're getting what you wanted.

24:23.562 --> 24:25.723
l suggest we part ways amicably.

24:27.098 --> 24:29.293
There is another option.

24:29.367 --> 24:30.664
We could assimilate
your vessel.

24:30.735 --> 24:31.667
lf a single drone

24:31.736 --> 24:33.897
steps one millimeter
out of that cargo bay,

24:33.972 --> 24:36.839
l'll decompress the entire deck.

24:36.908 --> 24:39.536
You won't pose much of a threat
floating in space.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.975
When your Captain
first approached us,

24:44.049 --> 24:46.483
we suspected that an agreement
with humans would prove

24:46.551 --> 24:48.746
impossible to maintain.

24:48.820 --> 24:53.951
You are erratic, conflicted,
disorganized.

24:54.025 --> 24:57.654
Every decision is debated,
every action questioned,

24:57.729 --> 25:03.099
every individual entitled
to their own small opinion.

25:03.168 --> 25:06.604
You lack harmony, cohesion...

25:06.671 --> 25:08.571
greatness.

25:11.209 --> 25:13.609
lt will be your undoing.

25:15.547 --> 25:18.675
Escort our guest back
to the cargo bay.

25:48.647 --> 25:51.138
Well, l've made my decision.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.615
lf it were only a matter

25:52.684 --> 25:55.881
of going against the orders
of my superior officer...

25:57.989 --> 26:01.356
You're more
than just my Captain.

26:01.426 --> 26:03.553
You're my friend.

26:05.630 --> 26:07.962
l hope you'll understand.

26:29.454 --> 26:36.155
Species 847 2 has penetrated
matrix 010, grid 19.

26:36.227 --> 26:39.253
Eight planets destroyed.

26:39.331 --> 26:41.925
31 2 vessels disabled.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.494
4, 000, 621 Borg eliminated.

26:46.571 --> 26:49.506
We must seize control
of the Alpha Quadrant vessel

26:49.574 --> 26:51.633
and take it
into the alien realm.

26:51.710 --> 26:53.541
We understand.

27:06.391 --> 27:09.417
Class- H moon,
oxygen- argon atmosphere.

27:09.494 --> 27:10.552
lt'll do.

27:10.629 --> 27:11.823
Take us out of warp,
and enter orbit.

27:11.896 --> 27:12.863
Aye, sir.

27:12.931 --> 27:15.058
Tuvok...stand by
to transport the Borg

27:15.133 --> 27:16.691
directly from the cargo bay.

27:16.768 --> 27:18.827
After they're on the surface,
have security run a sweep of...

27:18.903 --> 27:21.667
l'm reading power fluctuations
in the deflector array.

27:21.740 --> 27:23.037
Cause?

27:23.108 --> 27:24.905
lt looks like the Borg have
accessed deflector control.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.307
They're trying to realign
the emitters.

27:26.378 --> 27:27.572
Shut them out.

27:31.149 --> 27:33.310
They've bypassed
security protocols.

27:41.259 --> 27:43.352
They're emitting
a resonant graviton beam.

27:43.428 --> 27:45.896
lt's creating
another singularity!

27:45.964 --> 27:46.931
Reverse course.

27:47.032 --> 27:51.059
We're fighting intense
gravimetric distortion.

27:51.136 --> 27:52.865
l can't break free!

27:52.937 --> 27:55.428
Bridge to Cargo Bay 2.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.701
Stop what you're doing,

27:56.775 --> 27:59.505
or l'll depressurize that deck
and blow you out into space.

27:59.577 --> 28:01.408
This is your final warning.

28:04.149 --> 28:05.138
Do it.

28:28.139 --> 28:30.039
Decompression cycle complete.

28:33.244 --> 28:35.371
l still don't have
deflector control.

28:35.447 --> 28:38.007
Commander,
a single Borg has survived.

28:44.055 --> 28:46.023
We're being pulled in!

28:58.403 --> 28:59.665
Report.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.832
We appear to have crossed
an interdimensional rift.

29:03.908 --> 29:05.637
We've definitely
left our galaxy.

29:05.710 --> 29:07.735
No stars, no planets.

29:07.812 --> 29:09.211
Let's see.

29:12.550 --> 29:14.177
l'm recalibrating sensors.

29:16.788 --> 29:19.848
The entire region
is filled with...

29:19.924 --> 29:22.154
with some kind of organic fluid.

29:23.228 --> 29:25.093
This isn't space.

29:25.163 --> 29:27.063
lt's matter.

29:28.700 --> 29:30.190
Commander Chakotay.

29:30.268 --> 29:33.863
We have entered the domain
of Species 8472.

29:34.005 --> 29:36.735
Report to the cargo bay.

29:36.808 --> 29:40.744
Paris, repressurize Cargo Bay 2.

29:40.812 --> 29:42.143
Tuvok.

29:49.420 --> 29:53.379
Our entry into fluidic space
has created a compression wave.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.255
They know we're here.

29:55.326 --> 29:58.921
A fleet of bioships is already
converging on our position.

29:58.997 --> 30:02.091
Time to intercept:
three hours, 17 minutes.

30:02.167 --> 30:05.534
You've been here before.

30:05.603 --> 30:07.298
How else could you know
about fluidic space?

30:07.372 --> 30:09.840
We must prepare this vessel
for the altercation.

30:09.908 --> 30:11.739
We will construct a complement
of biomolecular war...

30:11.810 --> 30:15.405
Why?
Why were you here?

30:18.783 --> 30:22.776
You started this war...
didn't you?

30:24.122 --> 30:25.089
What's the matter?

30:25.156 --> 30:27.147
Our galaxy wasn't
big enough for you?

30:27.225 --> 30:29.159
You had to conquer
new territory?

30:29.227 --> 30:31.718
But this race fought back--

30:31.796 --> 30:34.264
a species as malevolent
as your own.

30:36.367 --> 30:41.634
Species 8472 was more resistant
than we anticipated.

30:41.706 --> 30:44.334
Their technology
is biogenically engineered.

30:44.409 --> 30:46.877
lt is superior to that
of all other species

30:46.945 --> 30:48.276
we have previously encountered.

30:48.346 --> 30:51.008
Which is precisely
what you wanted.

30:51.082 --> 30:53.880
They are the apex
of biological evolution.

30:53.952 --> 30:56.512
Their assimilation
would have greatly added

30:56.588 --> 30:57.919
to our own perfection.

30:57.989 --> 31:00.082
So, instead of assimilating
these aliens,

31:00.158 --> 31:02.854
you opened a door for them
to our galaxy.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.525
There is only one
course of action.

31:07.599 --> 31:09.794
Destroy them first.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.836
My subspace link
to the collective

31:11.903 --> 31:14.701
has been weakened
by the interdimensional rift.

31:14.772 --> 31:16.763
We cannot signal for help.

31:16.841 --> 31:18.138
We are alone.

31:18.209 --> 31:22.373
We must construct a complement
of biomolecular warheads

31:22.447 --> 31:24.074
and modify your weapons
to launch them.

31:24.148 --> 31:25.877
l've got a better idea.

31:25.950 --> 31:28.316
Why don't you open up
that rift again

31:28.386 --> 31:29.978
and take us back?

31:30.088 --> 31:33.615
lf l do that, you will
no longer cooperate.

31:33.691 --> 31:34.988
Doctor to Chakotay.

31:35.093 --> 31:36.151
Go ahead.

31:36.227 --> 31:37.990
Report to Sick Bay at once.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.757
On my way.

31:46.004 --> 31:46.993
Captain?

31:47.138 --> 31:49.936
Ah, as you can see,

31:50.008 --> 31:52.203
l've repaired her neural damage.

31:52.277 --> 31:55.713
Ensign Kim, the Captain--
l'm two for two.

31:55.780 --> 31:57.680
Doctor, if you'll excuse us
for a moment.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.148
Hmm?

31:59.217 --> 32:00.741
Eh?

32:00.852 --> 32:04.219
Oh. Gladly.

32:04.255 --> 32:05.984
Computer,
deactivate EMH program.

32:09.093 --> 32:10.924
The Doctor brought
me up to speed,

32:11.029 --> 32:15.227
but he couldn't tell me
what l really wanted to know.

32:15.300 --> 32:17.860
Why?

32:17.936 --> 32:20.370
The collective ordered me
to reverse course,

32:20.438 --> 32:22.929
travel 40 light- years
back the way we came.

32:23.041 --> 32:23.973
What would you have done?

32:24.042 --> 32:25.509
l probably would have
reversed course--

32:25.576 --> 32:27.237
maintained the alliance
as long as possible.

32:27.312 --> 32:29.337
ln my mind, the alliance
was already over.

32:29.414 --> 32:30.381
You never trusted me.

32:30.448 --> 32:31.972
You never believed
this would work.

32:32.050 --> 32:33.813
You were just waiting
for an opportunity

32:33.885 --> 32:34.977
to circumvent my orders.

32:35.053 --> 32:36.680
Trust had nothing to do with it.

32:36.754 --> 32:38.119
l made a tactical decision.

32:38.189 --> 32:39.417
And so did l.

32:39.490 --> 32:41.617
They've been taking advantage
of us from day one.

32:41.693 --> 32:43.490
We made concessions,
so did they.

32:43.561 --> 32:44.687
They lied.

32:44.762 --> 32:48.129
The Borg started the war
with Species 8472.

32:51.869 --> 32:54.531
We've only got one Borg left
to worry about.

32:54.605 --> 32:55.697
We should try to disable her

32:55.773 --> 32:57.240
and get back
to the Delta Quadrant.

32:57.308 --> 32:59.936
We might be able to duplicate
the deflector protocols

33:00.011 --> 33:01.603
they used to open a singularity.

33:01.713 --> 33:04.113
No.

33:04.148 --> 33:07.083
l won't be caught tinkering
with the deflector

33:07.151 --> 33:08.778
when those aliens attack.

33:08.853 --> 33:11.014
There is no other way out
of this, Chakotay.

33:11.089 --> 33:12.454
lt's too late for opinions.

33:12.523 --> 33:13.820
lt's too late for discussion.

33:13.891 --> 33:15.916
lt's time to make the call,
and l'm making it.

33:15.994 --> 33:19.430
We fight the aliens, in full
cooperation with the Borg.

33:19.497 --> 33:22.159
l was linked
to a collective once, remember?

33:22.233 --> 33:24.758
l had a neuro- transceiver
embedded in my spine.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.463
l know who we're dealing with.

33:26.537 --> 33:28.596
We've got to get rid
of that last Borg

33:28.673 --> 33:30.163
and take our chances alone.

33:30.241 --> 33:33.005
lt won't work.

33:34.312 --> 33:36.177
This isn't working, either.

33:36.247 --> 33:37.407
There are two wars going on--

33:37.482 --> 33:38.676
the one out there

33:38.750 --> 33:42.151
and the one in here, and...
we're losing both of them.

33:44.055 --> 33:45.716
"lt will be your undoing."

33:45.790 --> 33:47.018
What?

33:49.360 --> 33:53.694
Our conflicted nature,
our individuality.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.790
Seven of Nine said
that we lacked

33:55.867 --> 33:57.835
the cohesion
of a collective mind.

33:57.902 --> 33:59.733
That one day,
it would divide us

33:59.804 --> 34:01.431
and destroy us.

34:01.539 --> 34:04.531
And here we are,
proving her point.

34:04.575 --> 34:07.669
l'll tell you when we lost
control of this situation,

34:07.745 --> 34:10.475
when we made our mistake.

34:10.547 --> 34:13.244
lt was the moment
we turned away from each other.

34:13.317 --> 34:15.683
We don't have to stop being
individuals to get through this.

34:15.753 --> 34:18.847
We just have to stop
fighting each other.

34:31.101 --> 34:32.467
Captain Janeway.

34:32.536 --> 34:35.199
l've relieved Mr. Chakotay
of his duties

34:35.273 --> 34:36.672
and confined him to the brig.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.469
l'm back in command.

34:41.012 --> 34:43.879
And you understand
the situation?

34:43.947 --> 34:45.210
Completely.

34:45.283 --> 34:47.614
Tuvok, give her the nanoprobes.

34:47.685 --> 34:48.652
Work with her.

34:48.719 --> 34:50.846
Build as many warheads
as you can

34:50.922 --> 34:52.947
and start modifying
our weapon systems.

34:53.024 --> 34:56.482
l suggest we think about
enhancing our defenses as well.

34:56.561 --> 34:57.960
lf we're going
to fight this battle,

34:58.029 --> 34:59.656
l intend to win it.

34:59.730 --> 35:01.027
We are in agreement.

35:01.132 --> 35:02.224
Good.

35:03.501 --> 35:05.332
This is the plan.

35:05.403 --> 35:08.634
We engage the enemy here,
in their space.

35:08.706 --> 35:10.401
We show them
what they're up against.

35:10.475 --> 35:12.238
lf they have any sense
of self- preservation,

35:12.310 --> 35:13.436
they'll back off,

35:13.511 --> 35:15.809
pull their ships
out of the Delta Quadrant.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.541
That's provided
the weapons are effective.

35:17.615 --> 35:18.707
lf they aren't...

35:18.783 --> 35:21.274
it's been nice working with you.

35:23.788 --> 35:25.255
We've got to get this ship
armed and ready

35:25.323 --> 35:27.553
in under two hours.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.418
We're going to war.

35:52.717 --> 35:54.309
Borg modifications are complete.

35:54.385 --> 35:56.376
Bring them on line.

36:01.359 --> 36:03.486
Torpedo launch tubes active.

36:03.561 --> 36:04.994
Hull armor engaged.

36:05.062 --> 36:06.495
Shield enhancements stable.

36:06.564 --> 36:08.395
Biomolecular weapons are ready.

36:08.466 --> 36:12.732
13 standard photon torpedoes
and one class- 10 armed

36:12.803 --> 36:14.532
with a high- yield warhead.

36:14.605 --> 36:17.039
All hands, this is the Captain.

36:17.108 --> 36:18.405
Ready your stations,

36:18.476 --> 36:21.001
seal all emergency
bulkheads, and prepare

36:21.078 --> 36:22.045
to engage the enemy.

36:22.113 --> 36:23.603
Stand by for my orders.

36:29.754 --> 36:32.723
Four bioships
have just entered sensor range.

36:32.790 --> 36:33.916
Battle stations.

36:35.092 --> 36:37.424
l've got a visual.

36:37.495 --> 36:39.258
On screen.

36:49.340 --> 36:50.307
l can hear them.

36:50.374 --> 36:51.898
They want to talk through me.

36:53.211 --> 36:56.544
They say we've contaminated
their realm.

36:56.614 --> 36:57.979
Tell them we had no choice.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.108
We were only trying
to defend ourselves.

37:04.956 --> 37:07.447
They say our galaxy is impure.

37:07.525 --> 37:12.827
lts proximity is a threat
to their...genetic integrity.

37:12.897 --> 37:15.593
Tell them we have a weapon,
a devastating weapon

37:15.666 --> 37:17.531
that can destroy them
at the cellular level.

37:17.602 --> 37:20.002
lf they don't stop their attacks
on the Delta Quadrant,

37:20.071 --> 37:21.231
we'll be forced to use it.

37:24.609 --> 37:28.067
They said,"Your galaxy
will be purged."

37:44.528 --> 37:46.519
Shields and weapons
are off- line!

37:46.597 --> 37:48.497
Rerouting emergency power
to the launchers.

37:48.566 --> 37:50.227
They're coming around
for another assault!

37:50.301 --> 37:51.359
l've lost thrusters!

37:51.435 --> 37:53.835
Biomolecular warheads
are charged and ready.

37:53.904 --> 37:55.462
Fire.

38:03.481 --> 38:06.177
Direct hit on all four vessels.

38:06.250 --> 38:07.444
No effect.

38:08.386 --> 38:09.785
They're charging weapons.

38:23.734 --> 38:26.862
The nanoprobes were successful,
if not prompt.

38:26.937 --> 38:29.235
All four ships
have been destroyed.

38:29.307 --> 38:32.105
l think we've made our point.

38:32.176 --> 38:34.303
Now open a singularity
and get us out of here.

38:50.227 --> 38:51.524
Captain.

38:55.766 --> 38:56.926
Kes, are you still in contact?

38:57.001 --> 38:58.901
Yes.

38:58.969 --> 39:00.459
Tell them if they continue
their attack,

39:00.571 --> 39:01.697
we'll use the weapon again.

39:05.042 --> 39:06.202
They're not responding.

39:06.277 --> 39:07.471
Evasive maneuvers.

39:07.545 --> 39:08.569
Aye, Captain.

39:10.081 --> 39:11.013
They're in pursuit.

39:11.082 --> 39:12.845
Prepare to fire
the high- yield warhead.

39:12.917 --> 39:14.350
Aft torpedo bay.

39:21.926 --> 39:23.018
Ready, Captain.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.061
Do it.

39:34.405 --> 39:36.737
13 bioships have been destroyed.

39:36.807 --> 39:38.866
The others are in retreat.

39:38.943 --> 39:42.310
l have regained full contact
with the collective.

39:44.615 --> 39:46.014
What are they saying?

39:48.886 --> 39:51.753
All remaining bioships
in the Delta Quadrant

39:51.822 --> 39:53.813
are returning to their realm.

39:54.825 --> 39:56.793
The Borg have prevailed.

39:56.861 --> 40:00.297
With a little help from us.

40:00.464 --> 40:03.126
Now, it's time you fulfilled
your end of the agreement.

40:03.200 --> 40:06.692
Tell the collective we expect
safe passage from here on out.

40:06.771 --> 40:08.136
We'll give you a shuttlecraft.

40:08.205 --> 40:10.469
You can head
for the nearest Borg ship.

40:11.542 --> 40:13.169
Unacceptable.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.337
This alliance is terminated.

40:15.413 --> 40:19.247
Your ship and its crew
will adapt to service us.

40:23.587 --> 40:25.817
Resistance is futile.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.750
Captain, she's tapping
into helm control.

40:30.828 --> 40:32.728
She's trying to access
our coordinates.

40:32.797 --> 40:34.890
Shut her out.

40:34.965 --> 40:35.932
l can't.

40:36.000 --> 40:36.989
Bridge to Chakotay.

40:37.067 --> 40:38.261
Scorpion.

40:44.608 --> 40:47.577
Seven of Nine,
stop what you're doing.

40:47.645 --> 40:51.376
You're human,
a human individual.

40:51.449 --> 40:54.009
Our minds are linked.
We are one.

40:54.084 --> 40:55.813
l can hear your thoughts.

40:55.886 --> 40:58.286
His link is stable,
but it won't be for long.

40:58.355 --> 40:59.447
You must hurry.

40:59.523 --> 41:02.720
Just a few more seconds.

41:02.827 --> 41:04.761
l can see your memories.

41:06.931 --> 41:08.364
You remember being human.

41:08.432 --> 41:10.764
We are Borg.

41:10.835 --> 41:13.531
l see a young girl.

41:14.672 --> 41:16.902
A family.

41:19.543 --> 41:20.601
lrrelevant.

41:20.678 --> 41:23.112
Your appeal to my humanity
is pointless.

41:23.180 --> 41:24.909
Almost there, Chakotay.

41:24.982 --> 41:26.074
You've got
to keep her distracted

41:26.150 --> 41:27.276
if we're going
to make this work.

41:27.351 --> 41:29.785
Listen to your human side...

41:29.854 --> 41:31.412
to yourself...

41:31.489 --> 41:32.421
the little girl.

41:33.824 --> 41:36.588
Seven of Nine...Annika.

41:36.660 --> 41:38.389
He's losing the link!

41:38.462 --> 41:40.157
lnitiating power surge...

41:40.231 --> 41:41.994
now!

42:00.818 --> 42:03.378
Her connection
to the collective is severed.

42:03.454 --> 42:04.944
Get her to Sick Bay.

42:06.490 --> 42:07.548
Bridge to Doctor.

42:07.625 --> 42:08.717
Report.

42:11.095 --> 42:13.689
Commander Chakotay's going
to be all right,

42:13.764 --> 42:16.096
although he may wake up
with a bit of a headache.

42:16.166 --> 42:18.794
Tom, plot a course
out of Borg space--

42:18.869 --> 42:20.359
maximum warp.

42:20.437 --> 42:21.995
Yes, ma'am.

42:23.741 --> 42:28.542
Captain's Log, Stardate 51003. 7.

42:28.612 --> 42:32.070
Three days, and no sign
of Borg or bioships.

42:32.149 --> 42:33.878
We appear to be out of danger,

42:33.951 --> 42:36.249
but the entire crew is on edge

42:36.320 --> 42:37.753
and so am l.

42:37.821 --> 42:40.756
Not even the calm
of Master da Vinci's workshop

42:40.824 --> 42:42.519
is enough to ease my mind.

42:56.307 --> 42:57.467
Am l interrupting?

42:57.541 --> 42:58.667
Not at all.

42:58.742 --> 43:00.642
l'm just finishing up my log.

43:00.744 --> 43:02.211
The old- fashioned way.

43:02.246 --> 43:03.907
l wanted to get as far away

43:03.981 --> 43:06.575
from bio- implants
and fluidic space and...

43:06.650 --> 43:10.313
and this feels
more human somehow.

43:10.387 --> 43:11.911
l hate to spoil the mood,

43:12.022 --> 43:13.216
but you might want
to take a look

43:13.290 --> 43:14.279
at this Engineering report.

43:14.358 --> 43:15.450
lt'll take at least two weeks

43:15.526 --> 43:18.324
to remove the Borg technology
from our systems.

43:18.395 --> 43:19.794
B'Elanna did note

43:19.863 --> 43:22.798
that the power couplings
on Deck 8 work better

43:22.866 --> 43:24.356
with the Borg improvements.

43:24.435 --> 43:26.164
Leave them.

43:26.236 --> 43:27.362
How is our passenger?

43:27.438 --> 43:29.133
The Doctor says
she's stabilizing.

43:29.206 --> 43:31.674
Her human cells
are starting to regenerate.

43:31.742 --> 43:35.178
l wonder what's left under
all that Borg technology...

43:35.245 --> 43:37.611
if she can ever
become human again.

43:37.681 --> 43:39.273
You plan to keep her on board?

43:39.350 --> 43:40.977
We pulled the plug.

43:41.085 --> 43:43.576
We're responsible
for what happens to her now.

43:45.756 --> 43:48.418
She was assimilated
at a very young age.

43:48.492 --> 43:50.983
The collective's all she knows.

43:51.095 --> 43:53.791
She might not want to stay.

43:53.864 --> 43:55.695
l think she might.

43:55.766 --> 43:59.065
We have something
the Borg could never offer.

44:01.071 --> 44:03.005
Friendship.

44:05.109 --> 44:07.168
l want you to know
that disobeying your orders

44:07.244 --> 44:09.872
was one of the most difficult
things l've ever had to do.

44:09.947 --> 44:12.177
l understand.

44:12.249 --> 44:15.047
And l respect
the decision you made,

44:15.119 --> 44:17.144
even though l disagree with it.

44:17.221 --> 44:19.655
What's important
is that, in the end,

44:19.723 --> 44:21.782
we got through this, together.

44:21.859 --> 44:24.293
l don't ever want that
to change.

44:24.361 --> 44:26.226
Agreed.

44:26.296 --> 44:28.355
Good.

44:28.432 --> 44:29.421
Well...

44:29.500 --> 44:32.094
l think it's time
we get back to our Bridge.

44:32.169 --> 44:33.500
No argument there.
