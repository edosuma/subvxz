35:43.224 --> 35:45.392
Not Lilith.

35:46.018 --> 35:48.562
-Not anybody.
-Then what can?

35:49.313 --> 35:51.064
Nothing I've ever seen before.

36:05.121 --> 36:07.497
It's a hell of an art project
you got going there.

36:07.665 --> 36:11.084
Traps and talismans
from every faith on the globe.

36:11.419 --> 36:12.669
How you doing?

36:12.837 --> 36:15.255
Stakes, iron, silver, salt, the knife.

36:15.423 --> 36:17.632
We're set to catch
anything I've ever heard of.

36:18.426 --> 36:20.135
This is still a bad idea.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.554
Yeah, Bobby,
I heard you the first ten times.

36:23.598 --> 36:25.432
What do you say
we ring the dinner bell?

36:40.156 --> 36:42.949
[SPEAKS IN LATIN]

36:43.451 --> 36:45.827
So, million-dollar question:

36:45.995 --> 36:48.622
You gonna tell Dean
about what we're doing?

36:49.624 --> 36:52.459
Yeah, I just gotta figure out
the right way to say it.

36:54.086 --> 36:57.130
-Look, I just need time, okay? That's all.
-He's gonna find out.

36:57.298 --> 37:00.634
-If not from you, he's gonna be pissed.
-He's gonna be pissed anyway.

37:00.801 --> 37:04.721
He's so hard-headed about this psychic
stuff, he'll just try and stop me.

37:04.889 --> 37:07.307
Maybe I'll just take a step back
for a while.

37:08.142 --> 37:11.311
I'm not exactly
in your brother's fan club.

37:11.479 --> 37:13.063
But he is your brother.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.649
And I'm not gonna
come between you.

37:15.816 --> 37:19.653
I don't know if what I'm doing is right.
Hell, I don't even know if I trust you.

37:19.820 --> 37:21.488
-Thanks.
-What I do know is...

37:21.656 --> 37:23.365
...I'm saving people...

37:23.532 --> 37:25.825
...and stopping demons.

37:26.744 --> 37:28.495
And that feels good.

37:30.122 --> 37:31.623
I wanna keep going.

37:33.834 --> 37:35.877
[BOBBY WHISTLING]

37:47.765 --> 37:50.225
You sure you did the ritual right?

37:51.352 --> 37:54.729
Sorry. Touchy, touchy.

37:56.524 --> 37:59.359
[WIND WHISTLING, LOUD THUDDING]

38:12.415 --> 38:15.375
Wishful thinking,
but maybe it's just the wind.

38:50.244 --> 38:51.745
Who are you?

38:51.912 --> 38:54.956
I'm the one who gripped you tight
and raised you from perdition.

38:55.124 --> 38:57.751
Yeah, thanks for that.

39:10.431 --> 39:11.514
[KNIFE CLATTERS]

39:12.600 --> 39:14.225
[YELLS]

39:25.738 --> 39:27.113
We need to talk, Dean.

39:29.450 --> 39:30.658
Alone.

39:44.006 --> 39:46.633
-Your friend's alive.
-Who are you?

39:46.801 --> 39:47.967
Castiel.

39:48.135 --> 39:51.054
Yeah, I figured that much.
I mean, what are you?

39:52.890 --> 39:54.641
I'm an angel of the Lord.

40:01.732 --> 40:04.067
Get the hell out of here.

40:04.318 --> 40:06.611
There's no such thing.

40:09.740 --> 40:12.158
This is your problem, Dean.

40:12.451 --> 40:14.744
You have no faith.

40:15.830 --> 40:17.956
[THUNDER CRASHING]

40:29.468 --> 40:31.511
Some angel you are.

40:31.679 --> 40:34.347
You burned out
that poor woman's eyes.

40:35.683 --> 40:38.643
I warned her
not to spy on my true form.

40:38.811 --> 40:41.521
It can be overwhelming to humans.

40:41.689 --> 40:44.691
And so can my real voice,
but you already knew that.

40:44.859 --> 40:47.277
You mean the gas station
and the motel?

40:48.446 --> 40:49.696
That was you talking?

40:51.198 --> 40:53.700
Buddy, next time, lower the volume.

40:53.868 --> 40:55.869
That was my mistake.

40:56.078 --> 40:59.664
Certain people, special people,
can perceive my true visage.

40:59.832 --> 41:02.792
I thought you would be one of them.
I was wrong.

41:03.627 --> 41:07.172
And what visage are you in now, huh?
What, holy tax accountant?

41:07.715 --> 41:11.050
This? This is a vessel.

41:11.218 --> 41:13.219
You're possessing some poor bastard?

41:13.387 --> 41:16.222
He's a devout man.
He actually prayed for this.

41:16.390 --> 41:19.893
Look, pal, I'm not buying what
you're selling. So who are you, really?

41:21.395 --> 41:22.604
I told you.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.064
Right.

41:25.608 --> 41:28.902
And why would an angel
rescue me from hell?

41:30.738 --> 41:32.739
Good things do happen, Dean.

41:35.993 --> 41:37.327
Not in my experience.

41:38.662 --> 41:40.622
What's the matter?

41:43.042 --> 41:45.919
You don't think
you deserve to be saved?

41:49.089 --> 41:50.507
Why'd you do it?

41:53.636 --> 41:55.929
Because God commanded it.

41:59.266 --> 42:01.351
Because we have work for you.
