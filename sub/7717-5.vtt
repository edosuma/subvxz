into the spirit of Halloween.

could prove fatal to me.

I should've done differently.

Even though Jim was making great points,

18:45.448 --> 18:47.248
like, in favor of the song,

18:47.250 --> 18:52.954
Pam was like,
"no. Hate it. Stupid."

18:52.956 --> 18:55.757
This is all so silly, right?

18:55.759 --> 18:57.142
[Grunts]

18:57.144 --> 18:58.843
What am I gonna do, move back to Cornell?

18:58.845 --> 19:01.146
[Laughs] Yeah.

19:01.148 --> 19:03.515
I mean, what if we did that?

19:03.517 --> 19:06.768
Like, we got jobs
and we were happy all the time?

19:06.770 --> 19:09.187
Oh, well, Andy,
we're not moving to Cornell.

19:09.189 --> 19:10.805
[Chuckles] Duh, I know.

19:10.807 --> 19:12.690
- That would be insane.
- Yeah.

19:12.692 --> 19:15.026
It could totally work, though.

19:15.028 --> 19:18.329
I don't know why we wouldn't.

19:18.331 --> 19:19.781
Oh, my God, are we doing this?

19:19.783 --> 19:23.117
Oy. Andy,
what is going on?

19:24.503 --> 19:29.090
If I am not Boner Champ...

19:29.092 --> 19:30.842
I don't know who I am.

19:30.844 --> 19:34.212
Well, you know,
maybe you're the wise, old guy

19:34.214 --> 19:38.800
that the new, um,
B-O-N-E-R Champ looks up to.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.167
You know, you could just...

19:40.169 --> 19:41.168
Make a donation.

19:41.170 --> 19:43.354
Well, I was gonna say be a mentor.

19:43.356 --> 19:45.673
Yes.

19:45.675 --> 19:48.393
I'm gonna make a donation.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.311
And it just so happens I know someone

19:50.313 --> 19:52.730
who works at
the Bernard family foundation.

19:52.732 --> 19:55.233
- Her name is "mom."
- Oh.

20:00.706 --> 20:02.356
[Whispering] I want some of those pills.

20:02.358 --> 20:04.542
Oh.
Well, good for you.

20:04.544 --> 20:05.944
I mean, you'll need a prescription.

20:05.945 --> 20:07.795
Oh, no. No, no, no,
they're not for me.

20:07.797 --> 20:09.697
They're for my cousin Mose.

20:09.699 --> 20:12.717
He's just having a tough time,
being wifeless

20:12.719 --> 20:16.337
and a high-pressure job
and his crazy cousin Mose.

20:16.339 --> 20:17.589
- Other cousin Mose.
- Mm.

20:17.591 --> 20:21.709
Got it.
Well, you tell Mose

20:21.711 --> 20:24.762
that he's a good man
and I hope he feels better.

20:26.765 --> 20:30.735
Which one?
Mose or the real Mose?

20:30.737 --> 20:33.054
The real Mose.

20:33.056 --> 20:35.556
He says thank you.

20:44.323 --> 20:46.291
Mom, I had this really charitable idea

20:46.293 --> 20:49.443
to set up a scholarship
for a cappella kids at Cornell,

20:49.445 --> 20:51.913
and just need to wire
some money over there.

20:51.915 --> 20:53.280
What?

20:53.282 --> 20:55.282
