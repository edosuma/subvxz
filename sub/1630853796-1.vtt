WEBVTT

00:47.338 --> 00:48.715
Fuck.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.676
-Hi.
-Liv, where are you?

00:51.760 --> 00:53.261
-I just got your email.
-I'm fine.

00:53.344 --> 00:55.305
I just have to go out of town
for a couple of days.

00:55.388 --> 00:56.765
Out of town? Is everything--

00:56.848 --> 00:58.850
Everything's in the email I sent.
I know it's a lot.

00:58.933 --> 01:01.436
I just don't want any surprises.
I'll try to check in when I can.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.354
I just don't know what service
is gonna be like.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.774
Sure. Should I loop Danny in?

01:06.649 --> 01:08.026
This is Danny.

01:08.109 --> 01:10.111
He just came over with the merger.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.197
Hi.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.990
Um… nice to meet you.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.951
Yeah. Why… why wouldn't you?

01:18.620 --> 01:22.082
He's just asking
if you still want him on this.

01:22.874 --> 01:24.626
He's a great lawyer, of course, I do.

01:26.377 --> 01:28.963
Anyway, it's not my call.

01:29.714 --> 01:31.716
-Liv, are you sure you're okay?
-I'm fine.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.260
Let's circle back on prep strategy
once I'm back in the office.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.346
I've just never known you
to take time off--

01:36.429 --> 01:38.598
Ruth, I'm fine. I really have to go. Um,

01:38.681 --> 01:40.725
-text me if you need anything, okay? Bye.
-Liv…

01:42.018 --> 01:43.228
-Olivia Rivera?
-Yeah.

01:43.311 --> 01:44.854
You're the10 trip to Inuvik, right?

01:44.938 --> 01:47.232
Yes. My plane was supposed to leave
like an hour ago?

01:47.315 --> 01:48.483
Yeah, sorry about that.

01:48.566 --> 01:50.944
It looks like wind's pretty bad up
in Outer Rapids today.

01:51.027 --> 01:53.905
Your plane's stuck there,
so, you're kind of SOL, unfortunately.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.990
We can try to get you
on something tomorrow maybe?

01:56.074 --> 02:00.495
What? No! No, no, no. I-- I took
two flights to get here from New York.

02:00.578 --> 02:01.955
I have to get to Inuvik today.

02:02.038 --> 02:05.041
I'm… I'm trying to meet someone
before they leave again.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.752
-Maybe you can call them?
-No, I…

02:08.461 --> 02:11.756
She… she doesn't know I'm coming.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.716
Maybe you should tell her.

02:15.051 --> 02:17.345
Can you get me on a plane or not?

02:18.263 --> 02:21.391
I'm sorry, miss,
but I can't help you today.

02:54.007 --> 02:57.385
You look just like me when I was your age.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.265
I'm able to know that.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.600
Where are we going this time?

03:03.683 --> 03:05.185
Top of the Mackenzie River.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.187
Jesus. That's past Inuvik.

03:07.270 --> 03:10.023
Where are they gonna send us next,
the North Pole?

03:10.106 --> 03:11.441
-Excuse me.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.860
-Sorry. Excuse me?
-Flight 899…

03:15.945 --> 03:18.364
Excuse me! Sorry. Hi.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.325
Did you say you're going to Inuvik?

03:20.408 --> 03:22.368
Uh… past Inuvik, yeah.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.037
This is gonna sound crazy,

03:24.120 --> 03:27.832
but, is there any way you guys
could take me with you?

03:28.791 --> 03:31.044
Crazy for who? You don't even know us.

03:31.127 --> 03:34.172
Look, I'm small, I have this one bag.
I promise I'll be quiet.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.341
Quiet's not really an option
on a Cessna 208.

03:36.424 --> 03:38.343
I just, I really need to get
to Inuvik today.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.178
And it looks like my plane is stuck
somewhere and--

03:40.261 --> 03:42.847
-I'm sorry, we'd love to help you out.
-Then help me out.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.850
-Please.
-If it was just me?

03:45.934 --> 03:47.769
You know, but we're doing this for work.

03:47.852 --> 03:50.355
Somebody else is picking up the tab
and then if something happens,

03:50.438 --> 03:52.273
I think they may be liable for--

03:52.357 --> 03:54.025
No, they wouldn't. That's not…

03:54.859 --> 03:56.819
I'm a lawyer. That's not a thing.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.279
I'm sorry. Good luck.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.198
I'll give you a thousand dollars.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.826
Each. I'll give you each
a thousand dollars.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.371
Look, you guys do Venmo?
I can-- I can send it to you right now.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.289
Look, I feel for you. We just can't do it.

04:08.373 --> 04:09.999
I just want to sit on your plane.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.417
I just want to sit on your plane

04:11.501 --> 04:13.753
and travel in the direction
that you're already flying.

04:13.836 --> 04:16.422
-That's it. I just--
-Okay! Okay.

04:16.506 --> 04:19.008
-Everything all right here?
-Yes.

04:19.092 --> 04:23.554
Thank you. We're, we're just figuring out
who gets the window seat.

04:24.472 --> 04:25.473
Seriously?

04:28.184 --> 04:29.143
Yeah.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.854
-Sure. We'll get you to Inuvik.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.440
Oh, my God, thank you.
I'm Liv, by the way.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.483
-Sam.
-Sam.

04:35.566 --> 04:37.860
This is George, pilot ordinaire.

04:49.872 --> 04:52.875
Just souping her up. Sam likes to go fast.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.003
Cool.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.383
All good?

05:01.676 --> 05:02.760
All good.

05:51.642 --> 05:52.810
You're a nervous flier?

05:54.604 --> 05:56.439
I'm a nervous crasher.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.404
-I said no, I'm a nervous crasher.

06:03.946 --> 06:05.448
-Is this normal?

06:05.531 --> 06:10.370
Late summer air, mixtures of hot and cold,
makes for a rough ride.

06:32.433 --> 06:36.187
Hey. Hey, no cell phone.
You'll mess with the instruments.

06:36.270 --> 06:39.982
-Seriously? That's a real thing.
-Uh, it's fine.

06:40.066 --> 06:43.361
George just doesn't trust anything
without a rotary dial.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.574
Isn't there like smoother air higher up
or something?

06:48.658 --> 06:50.493
Do you have other thoughts?
How's my tracking?

06:50.576 --> 06:52.370
-I'm sorry. I'm just--
-Don't worry.

06:52.453 --> 06:53.579
George knows what he's doing.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.289
If I didn't, I wouldn't tell you.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.042
Hey, you want a drink?

06:58.126 --> 06:59.585
Might help calm your nerves.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.338
-No, I'm good.
-You sure?

07:06.384 --> 07:08.302
You want a Power Bar, bottle of water?

07:08.386 --> 07:09.846
Cocktail, New York Times?

07:11.180 --> 07:14.058
-I'm not really a Power Bar person.
-You ever been to Inuvik?

07:15.101 --> 07:18.020
There's not gonna be much open
by the time we land. Take them.

07:21.232 --> 07:22.233
Thanks.

07:24.152 --> 07:28.990
So, uh, what… takes you
to the northwest territories?

07:29.073 --> 07:30.491
I'm shooting the caribou run.

07:31.659 --> 07:34.787
Uh, not shoot. "Shoot."

07:34.871 --> 07:37.081
I'm a photographer
for National Geographic.

07:37.707 --> 07:41.085
Wow, your job's so much cooler than mine.

07:41.169 --> 07:44.464
Well, I don't know about that.
What kind of law do you practice?

07:44.547 --> 07:46.257
I'm a securities litigator.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.595
You're right. My job is cooler.

07:54.223 --> 07:58.019
Caribou run this late?
I thought that was a spring thing.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.647
Hey, you got to go somewhere
to come back, right?

08:02.273 --> 08:04.066
I just go where they tell me.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.111
I'll be sitting in a camouflage tent
with a thermos full of coffee

08:07.195 --> 08:08.988
and about 8,000 cameras,

08:09.071 --> 08:11.073
waiting for anything with antlers
to run by.

08:13.534 --> 08:14.535
That sounds nice.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.121
It does, doesn't it?

08:19.040 --> 08:20.374
And what about you?

08:20.458 --> 08:22.752
What brings a securities litigator
this far north?

08:23.336 --> 08:26.839
Um, just… boring lawyer stuff.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.759
Uh, it seemed like more of
an emergency back at the airport.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.596
I'm gonna take a nap.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.558
Uh, I'm sorry. I wasn't trying--

08:37.642 --> 08:41.771
No, it's fine. it's just I'm-- I'm tired.
Took me forever to get in from…

08:41.854 --> 08:45.191
-I'm just… tired.
-All right.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.777
We'll try to keep it down for you.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.555
Close your eyes.

09:17.139 --> 09:21.310
Ensure you're resting
in a comfortable position.

09:22.853 --> 09:25.898
Inhale and exhale slowly,

09:26.774 --> 09:31.153
in through the nose
and out through the mouth.

09:33.614 --> 09:39.704
Focus on tensing
and relaxing each part of your body.

09:40.913 --> 09:45.001
Allow all thoughts to fall away.

09:45.876 --> 09:48.629
You are only your body.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.883
You are only your breath.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.724
Hey, you made it.

10:00.308 --> 10:02.143
-Hi.
-Hi. Of course, I made it.

10:02.226 --> 10:03.811
You said you were having a crisis?

10:03.894 --> 10:06.147
Yeah, the crisis was that
you never come out to these things.

10:06.230 --> 10:08.065
-Ruth, I have work to do.
-No, Liv, no.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.067
-No. Come on.
-We have all have work to do,

10:10.151 --> 10:11.152
but right now take this…

10:11.235 --> 10:13.321
-No.
-…your work is beating Danny at darts.

10:13.404 --> 10:15.323
-We're down a player. Yes, yes.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.825
-Go. No, it's fine just go. It's great.
-Are you fucking…

10:17.908 --> 10:19.619
-Hey.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.789
I think I just got tricked.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.125
Why? You thought
it was a shuffleboard tournament?

10:27.084 --> 10:28.753
I can't stay long.

10:29.587 --> 10:30.671
Okay.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.340
Am I ready for this?

10:32.423 --> 10:33.883
I hear you're a shark.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.009
I've never played before.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.886
That's exactly what a shark would say.

10:42.266 --> 10:44.226
Is Ruth trying to set us up?

10:44.310 --> 10:46.520
Yeah, I think she is.

10:46.604 --> 10:47.897
Huh.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.940
Is that appropriate?

10:52.318 --> 10:54.320
-No, it isn't.
-Right.

10:54.403 --> 10:56.030
That's what I… Okay.

10:56.864 --> 11:00.785
Although, I guess, technically,
we're not at work.

11:01.786 --> 11:05.081
Right. Bit of a gray area.

11:14.882 --> 11:16.384
-Why are we flying so low?

11:18.594 --> 11:21.097
-No, shit I got nothing!

11:21.180 --> 11:23.641
-Whoa, buddy! We're going down!
-There's no pressure and fuel!

11:23.724 --> 11:24.850
George!

11:28.312 --> 11:29.689
Put on your seatbelt.

11:34.985 --> 11:35.903
Oh, my God.

12:16.569 --> 12:21.031
Help. Help!
George. George, help me out.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.076
-Right here.
-Yeah.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.039
Are you okay?

12:29.123 --> 12:30.791
I can't swim.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.460
I can't swim.

12:32.543 --> 12:35.045
-Do you have, uh, life preservers?

12:35.129 --> 12:37.798
-Sam! Sam, do you have life preservers?

12:37.882 --> 12:39.383
Flotation devices, something?

12:39.467 --> 12:41.927
-No. I don't know. I'll check.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.305
My leg is stuck!

12:50.478 --> 12:52.855
Ow!

12:52.938 --> 12:56.150
Guys, we got to get out of here!
I mean, this thing's gonna sink!

12:59.987 --> 13:02.990
Sam, I'm gonna need your help. Sam?

13:03.574 --> 13:07.203
What are you doing? Sam? No!

13:24.595 --> 13:26.806
-No, just stop, that hurts!
-I know it hurts,

13:26.889 --> 13:28.557
-but we've gotta get you out of here.
-Okay.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.689
Hold your breath.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.942
Please. Don't leave me.

14:40.921 --> 14:41.922
Liv!

14:44.842 --> 14:45.843
Help!

14:45.926 --> 14:47.052
Kick your legs!

14:47.136 --> 14:48.554
-Just kick your legs!
-Help!

14:49.471 --> 14:51.307
-Help me!
-Use your legs, Sam.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.351
-It's okay, Sam.
-Please, help me.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.061
-Help me!
-Hey!

15:05.654 --> 15:06.488
Help me!

15:08.115 --> 15:10.075
Sam, look at me! Stop!

15:10.159 --> 15:12.411
I need you to stop
or we'll both drown, okay?

15:12.494 --> 15:14.622
-Stop, look I got you.

15:14.705 --> 15:15.873
Kick your legs,

15:15.956 --> 15:17.875
-I'll take us both in, okay?
-Uh-huh.

15:18.459 --> 15:19.460
-Okay.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.879
-You got me?
-I got you.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.559
Oh, Sam.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.480
We made it.

16:29.530 --> 16:30.614
We're good.

16:32.950 --> 16:33.909
Sam?

16:37.871 --> 16:38.872
Sam?

16:41.792 --> 16:42.793
Hey.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.045
Hey.

16:46.630 --> 16:50.592
Hey. Hey, Sam, wake up.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.511
Hey, Sam.

16:53.595 --> 16:54.722
Sam!

16:54.805 --> 16:56.640
Hey, Sam!

17:03.105 --> 17:04.273
Oh, shit.

17:12.197 --> 17:14.408
-Sorry, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-No!

17:14.491 --> 17:16.118
You just have this metal thing
in your leg,

17:16.201 --> 17:19.997
-I'm trying to take it out.
-No! No, no, no, no, no, I'll bleed out.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.333
It's pretty bad.

17:24.752 --> 17:25.794
Uh…

17:26.295 --> 17:27.463
A tourniquet.

17:28.255 --> 17:29.840
You have to make a tourniquet.

17:31.925 --> 17:33.093
Okay.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.888
-My belt, use my belt.
-Yeah.

17:37.014 --> 17:40.059
Okay. It's okay. I got it. I got it.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.727
Wrap it round.

17:45.397 --> 17:48.984
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.119
I can't get it tight enough.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.245
Sam?

18:01.163 --> 18:02.998
Sam, how do I make it tighter?

18:13.717 --> 18:14.927
Okay, I think I got it.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.431
Oh, thank God it stopped.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.063
Shit, how do I keep this tight?

18:27.606 --> 18:28.899
Fuck!

18:34.113 --> 18:36.698
Stay with me, Sam. Please.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.662
Okay.

18:55.843 --> 18:56.927
It stopped.

19:00.055 --> 19:00.973
Sam…

19:01.974 --> 19:03.392
Sam, it stopped.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.032
Oh, thank you.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.302
Shit.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.029
I'm sorry, Sam.

21:39.589 --> 21:40.674
Sam…

21:40.757 --> 21:43.844
I'm not leaving.

21:43.927 --> 21:47.681
I'm just gonna go try and get higher
to see if I can get service, okay?

21:49.850 --> 21:51.101
I'll be right back.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.669
It's okay, it's gonna be okay.

22:17.753 --> 22:21.757
One bar. Just one bar. Stupid trees.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.842
Really? Fuck.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.659
Fuck!

23:36.623 --> 23:38.041
Hello?

23:42.212 --> 23:43.213
Help!

23:45.257 --> 23:47.092
Is anybody out there?

24:25.088 --> 24:26.173
Come on.

24:29.342 --> 24:30.760
Are you kidding me?

24:35.015 --> 24:36.600
Come…

24:36.683 --> 24:39.436
Come on, are you fucking kidding me?

25:16.097 --> 25:16.973
Ow!

25:46.419 --> 25:49.798
Okay. Well, I didn't see you helping.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.427
We'll figure out
something better tomorrow.

25:58.139 --> 25:59.558
Night, Sam.

28:31.292 --> 28:32.293
Sam?

28:33.586 --> 28:35.880
-Sam. Sam.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.425
-Hey, it's Liv.

28:39.467 --> 28:42.345
-Oh, it hurts.
-I know, don't try to move. It's your leg.

28:42.429 --> 28:45.598
No, my stomach.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.016
It fucking hurts.

28:47.100 --> 28:50.687
-Make it stop.
-Okay. Wait, hold on. Let me see.

29:00.864 --> 29:03.575
Oh, God. Shit.

29:09.164 --> 29:10.540
Where's the plane?

29:12.417 --> 29:14.377
It's… it's gone.

29:15.962 --> 29:17.046
We crashed.

29:17.130 --> 29:20.216
-What? Where?
-I don't know.

29:21.259 --> 29:22.427
Where's George?

29:24.804 --> 29:28.057
We're-- we're just gonna have to wait
for them to find us.

29:28.141 --> 29:31.102
We're gonna sit tight and we're gonna,
we're gonna stay right here--

29:31.186 --> 29:33.021
No, they're not coming.

29:34.397 --> 29:35.648
Of course, they are.

29:36.691 --> 29:38.067
George logged a flight plan.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.069
When you don't show up,
your company's gonna send--

29:40.153 --> 29:41.780
No, they're not.

29:43.448 --> 29:44.449
Sam.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.493
Where are the bags?

29:47.660 --> 29:51.289
-Where-- where are the bags?
-Sam, National Geographic's not just…

29:52.540 --> 29:54.501
When you don't show up,
they're gonna send someone.

29:54.584 --> 29:55.543
I'm not a photographer.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.718
No one's coming. No one knows we're here.

30:10.016 --> 30:11.351
You're on your own.
