00:02.033 --> 00:04.385
A person's soul continues
to live on after death.

00:04.453 --> 00:05.653
<i>Previously on Fringe...</i>

00:05.721 --> 00:07.121
And all we have to do is summon
the soul to the host

00:07.172 --> 00:09.040
and he'll be back here with us.

00:09.124 --> 00:10.992
Soul magnets.

00:11.059 --> 00:14.345
William is gone.
You can't bring him back.

00:14.430 --> 00:17.348
The soul magnets... drew
your consciousness into Olivia.

00:17.433 --> 00:19.550
I assure you
she is totally safe.

00:19.635 --> 00:22.353
Olivia's brain can...

00:22.438 --> 00:25.573
accommodate my consciousness
for... several weeks.

00:25.641 --> 00:27.141
Weeks?

00:27.192 --> 00:29.193
- Not a chance.
- 48 hours.

00:29.278 --> 00:30.778
Then I want you out of my agent

00:30.846 --> 00:33.064
or I'll have Dr. Bishop
figure out how to drive you out.

00:41.790 --> 00:45.460
The little old lady from Ipanina.

00:45.527 --> 00:48.529
It's the girl from Ipanema.

00:48.580 --> 00:50.131
And no.
Try again.

00:50.198 --> 00:52.884
Oh, Walter,
can we try something else?

00:52.968 --> 00:54.802
- And no showtunes.
- You're taking the fun out of it.

00:54.870 --> 00:56.471
What's the temperature, son?

00:58.006 --> 00:59.090
We're at 64 degrees.

00:59.174 --> 01:01.592
Perfect!
Astro, are we ready?

01:01.677 --> 01:03.144
Just about, Wally.

01:04.680 --> 01:06.848
- And you're sure this is safe, Walter.
- Perfectly.

01:06.899 --> 01:08.382
If everything goes
according to plan,

01:08.433 --> 01:11.269
the electrical current will latch onto
the dominant consciousness,

01:11.353 --> 01:12.820
which is Belly's,

01:12.888 --> 01:14.155
and coax it
into its new residence.

01:14.222 --> 01:15.990
I meant safe for Olivia.

01:16.057 --> 01:17.408
Oh. Of course.

01:17.493 --> 01:20.244
- No offense.
- Oh. None taken.

01:20.329 --> 01:23.564
Olivia's mind
is still peacefully at rest.

01:23.615 --> 01:25.583
She won't be aware
of any of this.

01:25.667 --> 01:27.902
Though we should all take
a few steps back.

01:27.953 --> 01:29.086
Excuse me?

01:29.171 --> 01:31.923
It's perfectly safe, son.
I assure you.

01:33.909 --> 01:35.009
EEGs are online.

01:35.076 --> 01:37.762
- You ready, Belly?
- Aye, aye, Captain.

01:37.846 --> 01:40.348
- Do it, dear.
- Okay.

01:40.415 --> 01:45.520
Three, two, one...

02:09.610 --> 02:10.711
Walter?

02:10.779 --> 02:12.163
Didn't work.

02:13.415 --> 02:14.432
Damn!

02:15.884 --> 02:18.169
You can reset
the circuit breakers, dear.

02:18.253 --> 02:21.556
Tell the medical school
we're returning Mr. Spencer.

02:21.623 --> 02:23.474
Sorry.

02:33.602 --> 02:35.353
So what now?

02:35.437 --> 02:39.440
Well, now I guess we try and
find another brain-dead host.

02:39.491 --> 02:42.309
And what makes you think
it's gonna go any better this time?

02:42.361 --> 02:43.778
That body
fit all of your parameters,

02:43.829 --> 02:45.429
and we were lucky
to find him in the first place.

02:45.497 --> 02:48.315
Perhaps we should
think up another idea.

02:48.367 --> 02:49.750
I have a new idea.

02:49.818 --> 02:52.503
You said that if you didn't
find a suitable host in 48 hours

02:52.588 --> 02:55.289
that you would just go away.

02:55.340 --> 02:58.309
Are you suggesting that I die?

03:00.629 --> 03:02.797
I'm suggesting
that I want Olivia back.

03:05.333 --> 03:07.685
And I'm losing patience.

03:07.769 --> 03:09.020
Peter...
Oh, Peter, help me!

03:09.104 --> 03:10.304
Astrid!

03:10.355 --> 03:12.506
What happened?

03:13.168 --> 03:14.723
Call 911!

03:14.843 --> 03:16.310
Female. 31 years old.

03:16.361 --> 03:18.195
Tonic-clonic seizures.

03:18.280 --> 03:20.314
No response
to 4 milligrams lorazepam IV.

03:20.365 --> 03:21.816
BP's 190 over 110.

03:21.867 --> 03:23.284
Trauma bay two!

03:24.286 --> 03:25.536
Pupils dilated.

03:25.621 --> 03:27.622
- How long has she been seizing?
- Going on twenty minutes.

03:27.689 --> 03:28.739
Twenty-five.

03:28.824 --> 03:30.157
Okay. Start her on
a phenytoin drip.

03:30.208 --> 03:31.659
- No, that's absolutely wrong!
- Excuse me?

03:31.710 --> 03:33.794
Gentlemen, you need to step
outside unless you're family.

03:33.862 --> 03:35.746
- He's my partner.
- She's my girlfriend.

03:35.831 --> 03:37.298
- Walter...
- William cannot tolerate

03:37.365 --> 03:38.416
phenytoin... He's anemic!

03:38.500 --> 03:39.583
She's crashing.

03:39.668 --> 03:41.052
Let's defib at 360.

03:41.136 --> 03:43.387
- Too much! It's too much.
- Walter, just let them do their job.

03:43.472 --> 03:44.839
What if his consciousness

03:44.890 --> 03:47.842
Uh... Uh... Uh...
Changed her physiology?

03:47.893 --> 03:49.310
A charge that size
directly into her heart...

03:49.377 --> 03:51.395
Walter, they have to do something.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.547
354. Charge to 360.

03:55.517 --> 03:56.717
Doctor...

03:56.768 --> 03:58.769
I've been jolted once today.

03:58.854 --> 04:00.021
If you do it again...

04:00.072 --> 04:05.076
you will kill me and the young woman
I'm living inside of.

04:28.984 --> 04:30.484
How could this have happened?

04:30.485 --> 04:33.504
Dr. Bell, you assured me that
Agent Dunham was perfectly safe.

04:33.555 --> 04:36.057
And I believed that she was.

04:36.141 --> 04:38.059
With the rats,
it was nearly two weeks

04:38.143 --> 04:39.760
before I began to see
any complications.

04:39.845 --> 04:41.312
What rats?

04:41.379 --> 04:43.214
My test subjects.

04:43.281 --> 04:45.983
When I was first conducting
soul magnet experiments

04:46.051 --> 04:47.151
thirty years ago.

04:47.218 --> 04:49.136
The rats lasted nearly two weeks

04:49.204 --> 04:51.906
before the host's
consciousness got lost.

04:51.990 --> 04:53.274
I never anticipated

04:53.342 --> 04:55.242
that it would happen
more quickly in a human.

04:55.327 --> 04:57.728
Wait. Go back.
What do you mean,

04:57.779 --> 04:59.647
with the rats the host
consciousness got lost?

04:59.715 --> 05:02.249
It seems that
at a certain point

05:02.334 --> 05:04.585
the brain can no longer
accommodate

05:04.670 --> 05:06.771
two people's consciousness.

05:06.838 --> 05:09.323
So one just went away.

05:09.391 --> 05:11.792
And no matter how hard
I tried,

05:11.877 --> 05:13.844
I was unable to retrieve it.

05:13.912 --> 05:16.881
You gave me your word.
48 hours.

05:16.932 --> 05:19.650
You said if you didn't find
a suitable host in 48 hours...

05:19.718 --> 05:21.852
I know what you're
going to suggest, young man.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.554
Peter has already said as much.

05:23.605 --> 05:26.123
But as much
as I may want to...

05:26.191 --> 05:28.759
I can no longer simply leave.

05:28.810 --> 05:31.112
And why not?

05:31.196 --> 05:33.030
Because at this point,

05:33.098 --> 05:35.649
your consciousness
is the only thing

05:35.734 --> 05:37.568
keeping Olivia's body alive.

05:37.619 --> 05:38.986
- That's right.
- Walter...

05:39.054 --> 05:41.472
How long before
Olivia's gone for good?

05:41.540 --> 05:43.457
Well...

05:43.542 --> 05:44.959
I don't know exactly,

05:45.027 --> 05:48.045
but based on
what we've seen thus far,

05:48.113 --> 05:55.720
I would say...
no more than... a day.

05:57.889 --> 06:01.175
Well, if we're going to
get Olivia back,

06:01.259 --> 06:02.977
we're not going to do it here.

06:03.061 --> 06:06.263
Okay...
What about this?

06:06.314 --> 06:09.216
What if we try
to activate her chi?

06:09.284 --> 06:10.801
Acupuncture?

06:10.869 --> 06:14.739
Yes. We try and stimulate
her seventh chakra.

06:14.806 --> 06:16.223
Pure consciousness.

06:16.291 --> 06:18.059
As much as I love the notion,

06:18.126 --> 06:21.212
it could take dozens of sessions
spread over several days.

06:21.279 --> 06:25.533
You said we had to find a way
to pull Olivia out in 24 hours.

06:25.600 --> 06:28.369
What if we don't?

06:28.437 --> 06:32.006
Have to find a way
to pull her out, I mean.

06:32.074 --> 06:33.574
What are you thinking?

06:33.642 --> 06:35.126
What if, instead of
trying to find a way

06:35.177 --> 06:36.844
to pull Olivia out,

06:36.928 --> 06:41.932
we try and find a way to go in?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.684
- Peter...
- I'm just saying consider it.

06:43.769 --> 06:45.803
We know he has a healthy ego.

06:45.854 --> 06:48.105
You don't start a company like
Massive Dynamic without an ego.

06:48.173 --> 06:49.306
But do you really think

06:49.357 --> 06:51.192
that he would let Olivia die
just so...

06:51.276 --> 06:52.960
He could go on living?

06:53.028 --> 06:54.228
I don't know.

06:54.296 --> 06:55.930
Maybe, maybe not.

06:55.997 --> 06:59.100
But on the list of accomplishments
for William Bell,

06:59.167 --> 07:01.318
cheating death would
certainly rank number one.

07:01.386 --> 07:03.237
- Hmm.
- Kids.

07:03.321 --> 07:07.024
We think that we
have found a way

07:07.075 --> 07:09.376
to bring Olivia's mind back.

07:09.461 --> 07:11.528
And to remove William's.

07:11.580 --> 07:13.214
Whole brain emulation.

07:13.281 --> 07:15.332
It's another one of
Belly's old projects.

07:15.383 --> 07:17.468
It describes
how an inorganic host

07:17.535 --> 07:20.054
can house organic material.

07:20.138 --> 07:22.973
We're gonna put Belly
in a computer.

07:23.041 --> 07:24.925
Much to do and not much time.

07:25.010 --> 07:28.229
While we go into Olivia's mind,
you can get to work on this.

07:28.313 --> 07:30.481
It's very self-explanatory.

07:34.486 --> 07:37.571
Wait, enter Olivia's mind how?

07:37.656 --> 07:39.990
We've done it before...

07:40.058 --> 07:42.726
When Olivia and Agent Scott
shared the dream state.

07:42.777 --> 07:43.944
It's a simple variation.

07:44.029 --> 07:45.613
Walter.

07:45.697 --> 07:49.583
As you know, every brain generates
a quantifiable electric field.

07:49.668 --> 07:50.951
If we can...

07:51.036 --> 07:53.287
tune ours precisely
to Olivia's,

07:53.371 --> 07:55.289
then we can share her mind.

07:55.373 --> 07:56.624
We can go looking for her.

07:56.708 --> 07:57.625
- Walter?
- Hmm?

07:57.709 --> 07:59.176
Where do you keep
the neurosensors?

07:59.244 --> 08:00.845
Back shelf by the fish food.

08:00.912 --> 08:02.046
If I remember correctly,

08:02.097 --> 08:04.798
you had to put
an electromagnetic probe

08:04.883 --> 08:06.183
into her brain and dose her

08:06.251 --> 08:08.018
with a massive amount
of hallucinogenics.

08:12.557 --> 08:14.441
Of course!
LSD!

08:14.526 --> 08:16.310
That could solve
the superego problem.

08:16.394 --> 08:19.563
Ohh...
Oh, that is brilliant, son!

08:19.614 --> 08:21.448
This may be a weird
time to ask,

08:21.533 --> 08:23.701
but have you ever tripped?

08:23.768 --> 08:25.202
- Are you suggesting that...
- Of course!

08:25.270 --> 08:27.404
It's Olivia's mind
we're entering.

08:27.455 --> 08:28.656
Presumably, it will be some

08:28.740 --> 08:30.908
maze-like iteration
of her psyche.

08:30.959 --> 08:33.294
Memories are subconscious.
You know her better than anyone.

08:33.378 --> 08:35.412
If she is lost in her mind,

08:35.462 --> 08:37.548
we need you to guide us.

08:37.615 --> 08:38.799
Astrid!

08:38.884 --> 08:42.586
We need to mix up
2,000 milligrams of LSD

08:42.636 --> 08:45.422
and... And we need
some sugar cubes. Please.

08:50.262 --> 08:51.812
You first, son.

08:53.148 --> 08:54.899
Don't be nervous.

08:54.966 --> 08:57.351
I imagine there are
things in this very lab

08:57.435 --> 08:58.802
that are as mind-blowing

08:58.853 --> 09:01.071
as anything that I've
experienced while tripping.

09:01.139 --> 09:03.107
Besides...

09:03.158 --> 09:05.642
This is merely a conduit
to Olivia's mind.

09:05.694 --> 09:11.248
And when we get there,
we should all be very cogent.

09:11.316 --> 09:13.450
Typically, you'd feel the effects
of the drug in thirty to forty-five minutes...

09:13.501 --> 09:16.253
But I've added an accelerant.

09:16.321 --> 09:18.322
You can start to prepare
the sedative, dear.

09:18.373 --> 09:21.292
I'll go and help Belly.

09:22.460 --> 09:24.378
Peter, don't worry.

09:24.462 --> 09:25.996
I'll keep my eye
on the monitors.

09:26.064 --> 09:27.765
I'll make sure you're okay.

09:27.832 --> 09:31.018
It's not me I'm worried about.

09:31.102 --> 09:32.486
I'm pretty sure
there's a good reason

09:32.554 --> 09:34.888
why we can't enter
each other's minds.

09:34.973 --> 09:38.142
What if we kick something
loose in there?

09:38.193 --> 09:39.509
Right now,

09:39.561 --> 09:41.612
I think you're her only hope.

09:43.615 --> 09:46.867
- How's it coming?
- So far so good.

09:50.905 --> 09:52.022
What?

10:01.249 --> 10:02.967
You're bald.

10:05.203 --> 10:07.871
I think he's an observer.

10:09.641 --> 10:11.475
It's okay, Peter.

10:11.542 --> 10:13.060
Walter, we're ready.

10:13.144 --> 10:15.145
Oh. Good.
Bring him over.

10:15.213 --> 10:17.681
It's okay.

10:36.067 --> 10:40.570
- Drugs?
- Yep. Lots of 'em.

10:45.910 --> 10:47.378
Whew.

10:47.429 --> 10:48.595
Ooh...

10:51.433 --> 10:53.250
That tickles.

11:24.416 --> 11:27.000
Peter! Peter!

11:27.085 --> 11:29.253
Over here!

11:29.304 --> 11:31.621
I think you better
help me down.

11:34.592 --> 11:37.161
Whoa... Whoa!

11:42.877 --> 11:44.562
No! No! No!

11:44.646 --> 11:46.430
Of all the places
to grab a man,

11:46.514 --> 11:47.598
you choose the crotch
of my pants!

11:47.682 --> 11:48.899
Hey, I broke your fall,
didn't I?

11:48.984 --> 11:50.100
You spared me no embarrassment
in the process.

11:50.185 --> 11:51.852
I thought you said
none of this was real anyway.

11:51.903 --> 11:55.022
I said that everything is a product
of Olivia's subconscious.

11:55.073 --> 11:56.857
My feelings
are most definitely real.

11:56.908 --> 12:00.744
- Where's Belly?
- I have no idea.

12:00.829 --> 12:02.529
He must have entered
somewhere else.

12:02.581 --> 12:05.032
It doesn't matter.
We're here for Olivia anyway.

12:05.083 --> 12:07.201
So what's the next step
in the plan?

12:08.503 --> 12:09.837
There is one, right, Walter?

12:09.904 --> 12:12.206
Please tell me that
the plan doesn't end here.

12:12.257 --> 12:13.674
Of course not!

12:13.741 --> 12:17.595
The plan... is to find Olivia
and guide her out.

12:19.848 --> 12:21.599
We just have to start looking.

12:21.683 --> 12:23.601
Wal...
Walter!

12:23.685 --> 12:25.552
Amazing, isn't it?

12:25.604 --> 12:27.721
How are we supposed
to pick Olivia out?

12:27.772 --> 12:30.774
All these people are dressed
like they raided her closet.

12:30.859 --> 12:32.860
More likely, she equipped them
according to her preferences.

12:32.927 --> 12:34.645
Our fault, I fear.

12:34.729 --> 12:37.731
Cortexiphan subjects
experience a strong desire

12:37.782 --> 12:40.317
to blend in,
to stay in the background.

12:40.402 --> 12:42.486
They were designed that way.

12:42.570 --> 12:44.705
Designed that way?

12:44.772 --> 12:46.540
Peter.

12:46.607 --> 12:47.975
What is that?

12:48.043 --> 12:50.494
I believe it's morse code.

12:50.578 --> 12:56.116
And unless I'm mistaken,
that's an S.O.S.

12:58.920 --> 13:01.138
What are you doing?

13:02.557 --> 13:04.475
Chocolate pudding.
My favorite.

13:04.559 --> 13:05.843
Ah, come on, Walter,

13:05.927 --> 13:08.095
you can't seriously be thinking
about eating right now.

13:08.146 --> 13:09.930
Of course not.
I just had lunch.

13:13.435 --> 13:14.685
What are you saying?

13:14.769 --> 13:17.471
I'm asking who it is.

13:21.159 --> 13:23.360
It's Olivia!
She's found us.

13:23.445 --> 13:25.779
Tell her to stay there.
We're on our way.

13:31.336 --> 13:33.304
Any changes?

13:33.371 --> 13:36.006
No.

13:36.091 --> 13:39.493
They all seem oddly peaceful.

13:45.016 --> 13:47.051
Do you really think
it's possible

13:47.135 --> 13:49.386
to upload a person's
consciousness to a computer?

13:49.471 --> 13:52.106
I don't know.

13:52.173 --> 13:53.907
I'm just following
Bell's instructions.

13:53.975 --> 13:58.629
The aim is for the computer
to mimic the behavior of neurons.

14:03.851 --> 14:07.888
I never understood why Walter
was so drawn to licorice.

14:07.956 --> 14:10.057
But look at it.

14:10.125 --> 14:13.160
The swirl...

14:16.081 --> 14:19.983
It's Bernini's spiral altar at St. Peter's.

14:20.051 --> 14:23.620
It... doesn't end.

14:23.688 --> 14:26.056
Did you clean that up?

14:26.141 --> 14:27.508
Yeah.

14:27.559 --> 14:29.709
I thought I'd help you
clear the table.

14:29.761 --> 14:32.563
You touched the tray
with the sugar cubes?

14:32.647 --> 14:36.350
Sure. Why?

14:39.487 --> 14:41.538
Have you ever taken LSD?

14:49.447 --> 14:51.215
The towers
are out of proportion.

14:51.282 --> 14:52.850
We should be closer by now.

14:52.917 --> 14:55.669
It's Olivia's mind
assigning importance.

14:55.736 --> 14:57.838
Our surroundings represent

14:57.905 --> 15:00.624
her emotional landscape,
don't forget.

15:02.577 --> 15:04.011
Oh. Oh, my.

15:04.078 --> 15:05.846
Olivia's stepfather.

15:05.913 --> 15:08.248
What? Where?

15:08.299 --> 15:12.936
Over there! That's...
That's him! Olivia's stepfather.

15:18.926 --> 15:20.927
Hmm.

15:20.979 --> 15:26.316
Walter, I'm... getting
a bad feeling about this.

15:26.401 --> 15:28.702
Any suggestions?

15:30.288 --> 15:34.158
Yes. Run!

15:41.949 --> 15:43.333
Oh!

15:43.418 --> 15:45.252
The cab!

15:47.672 --> 15:51.141
- Wait, wait, wait. You're driving?
- Okay.

16:06.074 --> 16:08.475
What the hell was that?

16:12.614 --> 16:13.614
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

16:28.680 --> 16:32.349
Peter... I made a skid.

16:33.468 --> 16:35.802
There. The elevators.

16:39.307 --> 16:41.775
Walter! Peter.
Hello.

16:41.842 --> 16:44.561
Nina! Are you a sight
for sore eyes!

16:44.646 --> 16:46.530
We're looking for Olivia.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.065
- Olivia?
- We think she's in an office

16:48.149 --> 16:49.483
near the top on the north side.

16:49.534 --> 16:50.951
Walter thinks
it's Bell's office.

16:51.018 --> 16:53.620
Okay.

16:55.022 --> 16:57.574
This elevator
is the fastest one.

16:57.659 --> 16:59.793
It will take you directly

16:59.860 --> 17:01.628
to the private lobby
of the upper floors.

17:10.888 --> 17:12.055
Walter!
Oh!

17:18.037 --> 17:19.529
Come on.

17:21.065 --> 17:22.566
Whoa...

17:22.650 --> 17:23.901
Okay.

17:29.357 --> 17:31.909
She tried to kill us.

17:31.993 --> 17:33.911
You saw.

17:33.978 --> 17:36.813
Why is everyone trying
to kill us?

17:37.898 --> 17:41.351
- I don't like this place.
- Me neither.

17:53.264 --> 17:56.967
Olivia?
You in there?

17:57.051 --> 17:58.602
Careful, Peter.

17:58.686 --> 18:00.270
We don't know
what her mind's put

18:00.355 --> 18:01.888
on the other side of this door.

18:01.940 --> 18:04.090
We should be ready
for anything.

18:08.313 --> 18:09.262
Belly.

18:09.314 --> 18:12.532
I lied.
Olivia's not here.

18:12.600 --> 18:15.602
I was concerned
if you knew it was just me,

18:15.670 --> 18:17.454
Peter wouldn't let you
come rescue me.

18:17.522 --> 18:20.824
Belly...
Why are you a cartoon?

18:25.780 --> 18:29.115
I'd ask yourselves
the same question.

18:42.728 --> 18:45.012
I found myself on the street,

18:45.064 --> 18:46.814
but neither of you were nearby.

18:46.866 --> 18:48.783
And then a car
tried to run me down.

18:48.850 --> 18:51.852
So I came here.

18:51.904 --> 18:53.955
I assumed it would be
a safe haven...

18:54.022 --> 18:56.858
But then I encountered Nina.

18:56.926 --> 18:59.694
I don't understand.

18:59.745 --> 19:02.130
If this is all
a projection of Olivia's mind,

19:02.197 --> 19:03.665
why is everything
turning against us?

19:03.716 --> 19:06.117
When she came to us in the lab,
she asked for help.

19:06.185 --> 19:10.338
What I'm starting to think is that
when my mind entered hers,

19:10.389 --> 19:12.873
her ego became confused...

19:12.925 --> 19:15.126
Her sense of self.

19:15.194 --> 19:16.477
Which, in turn,

19:16.545 --> 19:19.981
initiated the darker part
of her subconscious

19:20.048 --> 19:22.517
allowing her deepest
fears to run rampant.

19:22.568 --> 19:24.686
Explain that.

19:24.737 --> 19:27.238
We're saying
that Olivia is not aware

19:27.323 --> 19:30.191
that Belly's consciousness
entered hers.

19:30.242 --> 19:33.661
As far as she's concerned,
one minute she was fine,

19:33.729 --> 19:35.029
the next minute
she was set adrift

19:35.080 --> 19:37.064
in her innermost thoughts.

19:37.116 --> 19:40.335
It's her fears that are
causing the siege.

19:40.402 --> 19:42.370
Then, in that case,
she's not lost, she's hiding.

19:42.421 --> 19:43.621
That's what she does.

19:43.706 --> 19:47.074
When Olivia is afraid,
she retreats.

19:47.126 --> 19:48.092
That's not good.

19:48.177 --> 19:52.297
- And being lost is?
- Yes, it's better.

19:52.381 --> 19:54.382
I expected there to be
a logical trail

19:54.433 --> 19:55.633
whereby we could track her

19:55.718 --> 19:58.069
because Olivia
wanted to be found.

19:58.137 --> 20:00.254
If she's hiding...

20:00.306 --> 20:03.107
I'm afraid we're looking
for a needle in a haystack.

20:03.192 --> 20:05.026
He's right.

20:05.093 --> 20:09.948
Everything in her mind is dangerous
and hostile to her now.

20:10.032 --> 20:12.400
How can we expect to find her

20:12.451 --> 20:15.203
if she's frightened
of everything, us included?

20:17.656 --> 20:20.541
Because she'd do exactly
what you did...

20:20.609 --> 20:22.660
She'll find a place
that she considers to be safe.

20:22.745 --> 20:25.163
And she'll hide out.

20:25.247 --> 20:29.417
There's an entire world out there
with no rhyme or reason.

20:29.468 --> 20:33.471
Where would you like to start?

20:45.901 --> 20:47.735
Hey...

20:50.939 --> 20:55.410
I know you said only water,
but...

20:55.477 --> 20:57.612
It might be good
if you can eat something.

20:57.663 --> 20:59.897
But if you want,
I can take it away.

20:59.965 --> 21:02.083
That's fine too.

21:02.150 --> 21:04.419
Whatever you like.

21:04.486 --> 21:09.173
Thank you... for this.

21:11.877 --> 21:14.145
What you're feeling right now,

21:14.213 --> 21:17.465
it's just the effects
of the LSD.

21:17.533 --> 21:22.670
- But it's temporary.
- No.

21:22.721 --> 21:24.188
It's infinite.

21:24.256 --> 21:26.841
It's all around us.

21:31.947 --> 21:33.815
You didn't see that.

21:33.866 --> 21:36.567
I didn't see that.

21:38.937 --> 21:41.856
But now I know.

21:41.907 --> 21:44.709
And I know it followed me.

21:44.793 --> 21:47.495
What followed you?

21:47.546 --> 21:51.299
Death.

21:51.366 --> 21:53.901
I saw death.

21:53.969 --> 21:56.187
All of it.

21:59.758 --> 22:02.810
And it was me.

22:10.652 --> 22:14.338
Can you hold my hand?

22:14.406 --> 22:16.974
Please.

22:55.781 --> 22:57.148
Well, Peter?

22:57.232 --> 23:00.485
The first place I would look
is Jacksonville.

23:00.569 --> 23:02.203
Jacksonville's
the last place she'd go.

23:02.270 --> 23:04.288
Exactly. That's my point.
I know Olivia.

23:04.373 --> 23:06.791
She knows that that's the last place
anybody would look for her.

23:06.875 --> 23:09.360
We only have so much time,
Peter. Are you sure?

23:09.428 --> 23:11.195
Yes.

23:11.263 --> 23:13.881
Let's get to Jacksonville.

23:20.722 --> 23:22.473
I assume that's about us.

23:28.630 --> 23:30.130
The zeppelin.

23:40.275 --> 23:41.526
Peter!

23:59.661 --> 24:01.295
Come on, son!

24:47.109 --> 24:53.047
We should circumnavigate
the currents.

24:53.098 --> 24:55.399
I should have known.

24:55.484 --> 24:58.719
Should have known what, Walter?

24:58.770 --> 25:00.271
When we were over there...

25:00.355 --> 25:04.308
Getting Peter back,
and we were on that stage...

25:04.376 --> 25:06.327
You said good-bye to me.

25:06.394 --> 25:07.879
I should have known

25:07.946 --> 25:10.615
you had no intentions
of dying that day.

25:10.699 --> 25:14.835
As long as I've known you,
you've hated good-byes.

25:14.903 --> 25:17.004
I guess that's true.

25:19.407 --> 25:23.094
I need you, William.

25:23.178 --> 25:25.346
I don't know what to do.

25:25.414 --> 25:28.783
About Peter.
About the machine.

25:28.850 --> 25:33.971
About what's waiting for him...

25:34.039 --> 25:36.607
For the world
because of what we did.

25:36.692 --> 25:41.362
Walter, when we were young
and foolish

25:41.429 --> 25:44.916
with too much power
and too many dreams

25:44.983 --> 25:48.102
that no one could stand
in the way of...

25:48.153 --> 25:50.321
We needed each other.

25:50.405 --> 25:54.041
I don't understand.

25:54.109 --> 25:57.745
We needed each other then,
to check and balance.

25:57.796 --> 26:00.081
And now?

26:00.132 --> 26:04.218
Now you possess
the wisdom of humility.

26:04.285 --> 26:06.387
We didn't back then.

26:06.455 --> 26:10.091
The decisions you make
will be the right ones.

26:10.142 --> 26:14.261
The direction you choose
to take will be just.

26:40.756 --> 26:42.039
What's that?

26:42.124 --> 26:43.841
Fuel gauge.

27:08.367 --> 27:10.951
How many are up there?

27:11.019 --> 27:12.987
It's just me.

27:14.522 --> 27:16.707
This is a flare gun.

27:16.775 --> 27:19.076
You don't want to get
shot with a flare gun.

27:19.161 --> 27:21.028
- Peter...
- Walter, stay back!

27:22.514 --> 27:24.498
Who are you?

27:25.884 --> 27:27.885
What's your name?

27:27.969 --> 27:29.553
Peter.

27:29.638 --> 27:31.088
Peter what?

27:31.173 --> 27:33.307
Peter Bishop.

27:34.542 --> 27:36.477
Nice to meet you.

27:39.347 --> 27:41.732
Peter!

27:41.817 --> 27:44.652
Peter!

27:44.719 --> 27:46.070
Walter!

27:46.154 --> 27:48.572
Ahh!

28:05.424 --> 28:06.740
Walter!
You're here with us.

28:06.792 --> 28:08.242
You're back in the lab.

28:10.278 --> 28:11.796
It's all right.

28:11.880 --> 28:14.348
It's all right.
I'm back.

28:14.415 --> 28:17.417
I'm back.

28:17.469 --> 28:20.054
Oh, damn.

28:20.105 --> 28:23.441
I'm back.

28:29.983 --> 28:32.034
Your father'll be fine, Peter.

28:32.101 --> 28:34.603
He knows there's no time
to come back.

28:34.671 --> 28:37.356
And even if he tried,
he would never find us.

28:37.423 --> 28:38.857
We're on our own.

28:38.924 --> 28:40.492
Who was that guy?

28:40.560 --> 28:43.395
Someone unpleasant
from her past, I imagine.

28:48.117 --> 28:49.267
This way.

28:49.319 --> 28:51.936
We'll need to take
possession of a vehicle.

28:51.988 --> 28:53.372
Do you drive a motorcycle?

28:53.439 --> 28:54.823
I would love to ride
on a motorcycle...

28:54.907 --> 28:56.224
Hold on.

28:56.292 --> 28:58.327
You're going the wrong way.

28:58.411 --> 29:01.079
I've got ten years
of experience in Jacksonville.

29:01.130 --> 29:03.215
We're on East Union Street.

29:03.282 --> 29:05.584
It leads
to the Matthews' Expressway.

29:05.651 --> 29:07.619
If you want to get to the
Jacksonville Day Care Center...

29:07.670 --> 29:10.455
She won't be
at the day care center.

29:10.506 --> 29:12.307
We need to go that way.

29:16.062 --> 29:18.347
I thought you said
she was that way.

29:18.431 --> 29:23.068
And I thought you said you
wanted to travel by motorcycle.

29:27.323 --> 29:29.991
The computer's nearly ready
to receive Belly's consciousness.

29:41.587 --> 29:43.221
Hand me those tubes, dear.

29:51.330 --> 29:53.181
This should snap right in.

29:53.249 --> 29:54.549
Damn my hands!

29:54.634 --> 29:56.768
Walter, it's okay.
I can get you another one.

29:56.836 --> 29:58.720
There isn't another one.

29:58.805 --> 30:03.608
I'll have to modify the ECL 82 tube
from my phonograph.

30:03.676 --> 30:09.114
And I'll need tinfoil and instant glue
and a 60-watt light bulb.

30:09.181 --> 30:11.516
And hurry, dear!

30:28.634 --> 30:30.502
Where are we going, Peter?

30:30.553 --> 30:34.673
Olivia told me she lived
on the military base!

30:55.111 --> 30:57.078
Olivia once told me

30:57.163 --> 30:59.197
that she sometimes thinks
about what it would be like

30:59.248 --> 31:01.433
to just be normal.

31:01.501 --> 31:02.918
She said she falls
asleep sometimes

31:03.002 --> 31:04.653
thinking about what it
would be like

31:04.720 --> 31:07.539
if her life hadn't taken
the turn that it did.

31:07.590 --> 31:09.791
She told me that the last
time she remembered

31:09.876 --> 31:11.543
feeling that way
was the day before

31:11.594 --> 31:15.597
she met you and Walter
at the Cortexiphan trials.

31:20.470 --> 31:22.821
I think she's
down there somewhere.

31:22.889 --> 31:26.024
In that house, on that day.
Hiding out.

31:28.444 --> 31:32.113
They're all the same.
How will we find her?

31:32.198 --> 31:35.901
Her real dad painted
the door red.

31:35.952 --> 31:37.536
He told her
that it was good luck.

31:37.603 --> 31:39.604
The army told them it was
against regulations,

31:39.655 --> 31:44.142
but he was an important man,
so they let it slide.

31:54.971 --> 31:58.673
There aren't many
streets left, Peter.

32:01.511 --> 32:05.296
Maybe the door was painted green
again after they moved away.

32:05.348 --> 32:08.633
It wasn't.

32:19.729 --> 32:22.163
What are you waiting for?

32:22.248 --> 32:25.166
What if I'm wrong?

32:25.251 --> 32:27.285
What if she's not in there?

32:27.336 --> 32:29.921
I've taken us
so far off course...

32:29.989 --> 32:35.594
You should have thought of that
back at the zeppelin.

32:53.362 --> 32:54.863
Peter.

32:56.181 --> 32:58.033
Olivia.

32:58.117 --> 33:00.368
It's okay.

33:04.290 --> 33:05.540
I'm so afraid.

33:05.625 --> 33:06.958
I don't know what's happening.

33:07.026 --> 33:08.710
There are all these
people trying to hurt me,

33:08.794 --> 33:10.161
and this was the safest
place I knew.

33:10.212 --> 33:11.630
I know,
and I'm here to help you.

33:11.697 --> 33:12.831
But we don't have
a lot of time,

33:12.882 --> 33:14.365
so I can't
explain it all right now,

33:14.417 --> 33:15.550
but I need you
to understand that you're safe.

33:15.635 --> 33:19.838
It's okay for you
to come back.

33:26.228 --> 33:28.396
Peter?

33:28.481 --> 33:30.265
What's wrong?

33:30.333 --> 33:33.685
Peter, you're scaring me.

33:33.753 --> 33:35.253
You're not her.

33:35.321 --> 33:39.090
What are you talking about?

33:39.158 --> 33:40.909
This is not you.

33:40.993 --> 33:45.997
I can see it in your eyes.
It's not you.

34:01.213 --> 34:03.765
I just needed to know
it was you.

34:05.851 --> 34:06.918
Olivia?

34:06.969 --> 34:08.252
People have been
tricking me,

34:08.304 --> 34:11.589
but I knew the real you
would recognize me.

34:24.487 --> 34:26.286
Oh, no.

34:34.496 --> 34:36.164
Run!

34:49.645 --> 34:51.846
Peter, this way!

34:55.400 --> 34:57.068
Peter?

35:05.778 --> 35:07.579
Peter, Peter, Peter!
Peter, Peter, Peter, it's okay!

35:07.646 --> 35:08.780
- Calm down, son!
- Walter!

35:08.831 --> 35:10.949
Walter, she's here.
I found her!

35:11.000 --> 35:12.367
She's here!
I gotta go back, Walter.

35:12.451 --> 35:14.202
- Shh, shh, shh.
- I gotta go back. They're gonna get her.

35:14.286 --> 35:16.421
- Walter, what do I do?
- Nothing, dear.

35:16.488 --> 35:18.123
Nothing.
All we can do is wait.

35:18.174 --> 35:20.425
It's up to Belly now.

35:20.492 --> 35:21.492
Come on, breathe.

35:21.544 --> 35:24.162
In and out.
Hey... Hey...

35:24.213 --> 35:26.097
Hey...

35:26.165 --> 35:29.801
Oh, I lost her.

35:31.170 --> 35:32.287
I lost her.

35:54.212 --> 35:56.447
Go!

36:02.788 --> 36:05.673
No more.

36:05.757 --> 36:07.958
I'm not afraid of you.

36:28.980 --> 36:31.582
How?

36:31.650 --> 36:34.919
I suspect I know
what has happened here.

36:34.986 --> 36:37.955
I think my experiment
was right after all.

36:38.006 --> 36:41.859
You should have been safe
inside your mind...

36:41.927 --> 36:43.928
Except it's you,

36:43.995 --> 36:49.900
and you have never felt safe.

36:49.968 --> 36:52.603
You are your own
worst enemy, Olivia.

36:52.670 --> 36:56.841
You took the opportunity
to let your fears overwhelm you,

37:01.830 --> 37:03.297
but you just fought back.

37:03.365 --> 37:06.183
In the end, you are as strong

37:06.251 --> 37:09.920
as Walter and I
always believed you were.

37:09.988 --> 37:15.693
And now you know it too.

37:15.760 --> 37:17.795
So what happens now?

37:17.863 --> 37:22.199
Now, you go back.

37:22.250 --> 37:24.552
But not me.

37:24.636 --> 37:30.057
For you to survive,
I need to leave.

37:30.141 --> 37:31.509
I don't understand.

37:31.560 --> 37:35.095
You don't have to.

37:41.586 --> 37:43.320
Well, that's Walter.

37:43.388 --> 37:48.025
Right on time.

37:48.076 --> 37:53.848
Please tell Walter that I knew
the dog wouldn't hunt.

38:13.802 --> 38:15.519
Olivia?

38:18.990 --> 38:20.558
Hi.

38:22.861 --> 38:25.563
You lie there and rest.

38:33.121 --> 38:37.341
One consciousness.
One glorious consciousness!

38:37.409 --> 38:39.493
What happened to me?

38:39.578 --> 38:41.962
What do you remember?

38:44.165 --> 38:46.300
I remember you.

38:53.258 --> 38:55.893
And I remember
William Bell was there.

38:59.915 --> 39:01.815
Walter.

39:05.320 --> 39:07.321
It didn't work.

39:16.247 --> 39:19.500
He's gone.

39:19.584 --> 39:21.819
William's gone.

39:22.821 --> 39:24.238
Walter...

39:24.306 --> 39:28.492
I think Bell gave me a message.

39:31.262 --> 39:35.149
He said tell Walter that I knew
the dog wouldn't hunt.

39:40.388 --> 39:42.306
Walter, what does that mean?

39:44.359 --> 39:47.778
When we would do experiments,
he would use that expression

39:47.845 --> 39:49.346
when he knew something
wouldn't work.

39:49.414 --> 39:52.116
But he suggested the computer.
It was his idea.

39:52.183 --> 39:54.318
Exactly.

39:54.369 --> 39:56.954
He knew he wasn't coming out.

39:59.157 --> 40:01.659
And he hates good-byes.

40:13.388 --> 40:15.372
Welcome back, Olivia.

40:15.440 --> 40:17.741
Thank you.

40:27.035 --> 40:29.036
Walter?

40:42.200 --> 40:45.669
I downloaded <i>Zoom</i> for you.

40:45.737 --> 40:48.455
♪ Come on and zoom
zoom zoom-a zoom... ♪

40:48.523 --> 40:50.257
I can watch it

40:50.325 --> 40:52.860

40:52.927 --> 40:55.029
♪ Everybody's doing it,

40:55.096 --> 40:57.047
If you don't mind...

40:57.115 --> 41:00.401
I'd just like to be alone
for a while longer.

41:03.071 --> 41:04.204
Okay.

41:06.207 --> 41:08.258
Take your time.

41:45.463 --> 41:47.564
Well, you look better
than the last time I saw you.

41:47.632 --> 41:51.151
Yeah. It's amazing what a couple
of hours will do for a guy.

41:51.236 --> 41:52.936
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:58.576 --> 42:00.944
You hungry?

42:00.995 --> 42:04.314
Uh, no.
I'm okay, thanks.

42:04.365 --> 42:06.784
So how you feeling?

42:06.835 --> 42:09.203
Um...

42:09.287 --> 42:11.038
I feel like I've just woken up

42:11.122 --> 42:13.607
from a really strange dream.

42:16.327 --> 42:18.679
Thank you for coming to get me.

42:18.763 --> 42:20.347
It's not as dangerous

42:20.431 --> 42:24.184
as crossing into
another universe, but I try.

42:24.269 --> 42:26.286
You're welcome.

42:28.106 --> 42:30.440
What are we gonna have
to deal with next, right?

42:30.508 --> 42:32.726
I don't know.
But for some reason,

42:32.811 --> 42:35.913
I'm not afraid
to move forward anymore.

42:40.518 --> 42:41.785
Sure you don't want some toast?

42:41.853 --> 42:44.238
No, I... No, I'm fine.

42:47.024 --> 42:48.542
Who is this guy?

42:48.626 --> 42:50.627
I saw him in your mind.

42:50.695 --> 42:52.412
You had him locked up
in a zeppelin.

42:52.497 --> 42:54.414
He was just flying around
trapped in there.

42:54.499 --> 42:57.384
I don't know.
I haven't seen him before.

42:57.468 --> 43:01.288
But I think that he's the man
who's gonna kill me.
