00:02.536 --> 00:05.139
Hi. I'm Lecy Goranson
from "The Conners."

00:05.173 --> 00:07.208
The episode you're about to see
contains themes of gun violence.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.177
Viewer discretion is advised.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.745
Thanks, guys.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.514
The place looks great.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.483
But the "I" fell out
of the sign.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.218
It says,
"Welcome home, Louse."

00:18.018 --> 00:21.055
Somebody found their 40-year-old
bottle of Hai Karate.

00:21.089 --> 00:22.323
Yeah.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.025
Kind of a mistake.
It's pure alcohol now.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.227
I didn't even
have to shave.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.662
The hair
just fell out of my face.

00:28.696 --> 00:32.032
Aww, too bad
Mark can't be here.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.967
Is he already
in Springfield?

00:34.001 --> 00:36.003
Yeah, and I --
I was a little nervous

00:36.036 --> 00:38.139
about letting him go
on an overnight field trip

00:38.172 --> 00:39.973
after the way he's been
acting out.

00:40.007 --> 00:42.343
I remember my trip
to Springfield.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.512
There's nothing more exciting
than learning the inner-workings

00:44.545 --> 00:46.747
of a bicameral legislature.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.916
Oh, my God,
I learned something.

00:48.949 --> 00:51.051
Okay, she's here. Tour bus
just pulled up out front.

00:51.085 --> 00:52.220
Everybody hide!

00:52.253 --> 00:54.488
Oh, wait.
She's lugging a bunch of bags,

00:54.522 --> 00:56.190
a guitar, and an amp.
Shouldn't we help her?

00:56.224 --> 00:58.058
No! You'll ruin
the surprise!

00:59.427 --> 01:00.728
Louise:
Hello?! Uh...

01:00.761 --> 01:03.131
H-Hi.
Is anybody there?

01:03.164 --> 01:04.832
I could use
some help here!

01:04.865 --> 01:05.966
Oh, my God.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.568
You --
You locked the door?!

01:07.601 --> 01:09.837
You knew
I was coming home today!

01:09.870 --> 01:13.907
I can smell
Dan's Hai Karate from out here!

01:13.941 --> 01:15.709
I know he's in there!

01:15.743 --> 01:18.546
Son of a bitch!

01:18.579 --> 01:19.847
Surprise!
Surprise!
Surprise!
Surprise!

01:19.880 --> 01:21.182
Welcome home!

01:21.215 --> 01:22.550
Wasn't that fun?!

01:22.583 --> 01:24.352
I missed you so much, baby. Mm.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.987
Mm. Oh, is that
what Nashville smells like?

01:27.020 --> 01:28.055
Hey.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.690
I got
a little sweaty.

01:29.723 --> 01:30.991
10 musicians
on a bus,

01:31.024 --> 01:33.161
I'm the only one
who change a tire.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.828
Put down your sitar.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.597
Learn some life skills.

01:37.731 --> 01:40.134
Oh, thanks for
all this.

01:40.168 --> 01:41.835
It's great to be home.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.471
And because
I love you so much,

01:43.504 --> 01:46.073
I won't hug you
until I take a shower.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.341
Oh, sorry.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.843
Mary's here
because DJ's away on business,

01:49.877 --> 01:51.979
and some mean girl
called her "fuzzy legs,"

01:52.012 --> 01:53.847
so she's been in the shower,
hackin' away

01:53.881 --> 01:55.216
for the last half-hour.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.984
That's sweet.

01:57.017 --> 01:59.520
I remember when I cared enough
to shave my legs.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.622
I like
your hairy legs.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.624
It makes me think
I'm married to

02:03.657 --> 02:06.460
a devil-may-care
French woman. Oh.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.128
And, you know,
your ear hair

02:08.162 --> 02:10.664
makes me think of
the Gardens of Versailles.

02:10.698 --> 02:13.000
Oh-ho-ho!

02:13.033 --> 02:14.134
Well,
Mary might be a while,

02:14.168 --> 02:16.003
so let's, uh,
microwave some water,

02:16.036 --> 02:18.206
and you can hit your hot spots
in the sink.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.641
Uh, you know,
as much as I'd love

02:20.674 --> 02:23.377
to just take my shirt off
and bathe in front of you all

02:23.411 --> 02:25.746
why don't I just
have a cup of coffee?

02:25.779 --> 02:28.048
Yeah.

02:28.081 --> 02:30.017
Oh,
let me get it.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.652
You must be exhausted.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.053
Oh, thanks.

02:33.086 --> 02:36.357
So, uh, what did I miss
around here?

02:36.390 --> 02:38.125
Well,
you already heard

02:38.158 --> 02:40.160
the big news
about Mary's legs.

02:40.194 --> 02:42.363
Uh, only other thing
is, uh,

02:42.396 --> 02:43.864
Becky and I
are moving out.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.032
Oh.

02:45.065 --> 02:48.068
What a lovely
homecoming gift.

02:48.101 --> 02:49.337
Uh, wow.
Really?

02:49.370 --> 02:51.205
You aren't even
gonna pretend to miss us?

02:51.239 --> 02:53.741
You want me to pretend?
Would that help?

02:53.774 --> 02:56.477
It'd help me.
I'm fragile.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.212
I'm devastated.

02:58.246 --> 03:00.648
You girls
must be so excited,

03:00.681 --> 03:03.183
striking out on your own
in your 40s.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.985
Yeah, but we are
a little concerned

03:05.018 --> 03:06.186
about leaving Dad.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.456
Oh, you don't have to
worry about him.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.691
I'll walk him,
I'll feed him twice a day,

03:10.724 --> 03:13.026
and at night,
I'll make sure he's in his crate

03:13.060 --> 03:15.162
so he doesn't
chew up my slippers.

03:15.195 --> 03:18.031
There's probably a few things
about living with Dan

03:18.065 --> 03:19.233
you might not know.

03:19.267 --> 03:20.868
What are you
talking about?

03:20.901 --> 03:22.470
I know
how to take care of Dan.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.705
Well, you may have
stayed over,

03:24.738 --> 03:26.240
but you haven't
lived with him.

03:26.274 --> 03:28.141
It's like
going to the zoo.

03:28.175 --> 03:29.142
There's what you see

03:29.176 --> 03:31.545
when you walk past
a majestic old lion's den,

03:31.579 --> 03:34.047
but what you don't see
is the guy in the back

03:34.081 --> 03:35.849
sticking a pill
up a goat's head

03:35.883 --> 03:37.518
and lobbing it
over the fence.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.120
I've, uh, written down
the important stuff.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.958
For example, don't let him
over-salt the food.
Mm-hmm.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.694
He's having
dinner <i>tonight,</i>

03:46.727 --> 03:48.862
not preserving it
for the winter.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.965
And don't let him
take his meds with beer.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.034
He'll fight you,
but you gotta stand your ground.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.736
And make sure
they're his meds.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.170
Last week,
I caught him taking

03:57.204 --> 03:59.707
a couple of Good & Plenty's
instead of his statins.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.708
Mm.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.044
What is it?

04:04.077 --> 04:06.179
Oh, my God.
What's happening?

04:06.213 --> 04:09.517
Somebody just got shot
at Lanford Woods Mall.

04:09.550 --> 04:10.984
No!

04:11.018 --> 04:13.421
That's where Emilio
took Beverly Rose.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.992
<i>Captions by VITAC</i> --

04:23.297 --> 04:24.998
Reporter:
<i>It's a very chaotic scene here
at the Lanford Woods Mall.</i>

04:25.032 --> 04:26.500
<i>Police have told anyone inside
to shelter in place</i>

04:26.534 --> 04:30.704
<i>while they continue
to search for the suspect.</i> Hey.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.506
What is up with all the police
in the neighborhood?

04:32.540 --> 04:34.074
Somebody got shot
at the mall.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.976
We're probably
a staging area.

04:36.009 --> 04:38.312
Emilio's not answering.
I'm going down there.

04:38.346 --> 04:39.980
Oh,
I'll go with you.
No, no!

04:40.013 --> 04:41.849
The cops won't let you
near the place, Dan.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.984
I'm still in touch with a couple
of friends on the force.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.819
I'll go.
Maybe I can get Becky through.

04:45.853 --> 04:48.021
Oh, my God.
This is crazy.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.023
It's like
it happens every day.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.359
It <i>does</i>
happen every day.

04:51.392 --> 04:52.993
Man: <i>Lanford Police!
Please remain indoors!</i>

04:53.026 --> 04:54.728
<i>Do not
leave your house!</i>

04:54.762 --> 04:56.897
<i>I repeat --
do not leave your house!</i>

04:56.930 --> 04:59.166
Well,
that can't be good.

04:59.199 --> 05:01.168
We have to
stay inside.
No, I need
to go down there!

05:01.201 --> 05:03.036
Becky!
I have to see
if Beverly Rose is okay!

05:03.070 --> 05:04.204
They're -- They're locking up
the neighborhood.

05:04.237 --> 05:05.238
They only do that

05:05.272 --> 05:07.174
if they think
the suspect is in the area.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.176
We can't be
out there.

05:09.209 --> 05:10.844
H-Hey, I-I thought
he was at the mall.

05:10.878 --> 05:11.979
Now he's somewhere
around here?

05:12.012 --> 05:14.214
Welcome home, right?

05:17.050 --> 05:19.587
Emilio?! Oh, my God!
Are you okay?!

05:19.620 --> 05:20.888
Emilio: <i>Yes.
Everything's okay.</i>

05:20.921 --> 05:22.189
<i>I-I'm sorry
I didn't call sooner.</i>

05:22.222 --> 05:23.824
<i>We -- We had to hide
in the mall restroom</i>

05:23.857 --> 05:26.059
<i>until the police told us
it was safe to come out.</i>

05:26.093 --> 05:27.561
<i>They made us
turn off our phones</i>

05:27.595 --> 05:28.962
<i>so we wouldn't make
any noise.</i>

05:28.996 --> 05:30.998
Let me talk
to Beverly Rose.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.636
Thank God they're okay.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.638
What's going on outside?
I want to see.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.072
No, Mary,
not right now.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.642
There's, uh,
some trouble at the mall,

05:41.675 --> 05:43.644
and the police
are looking for the bad guy.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.879
Did somebody
shoot somebody?

05:46.947 --> 05:49.149
Yes,
but we are safe here,

05:49.182 --> 05:50.484
so you do not
need to be afraid.

05:50.518 --> 05:51.885
I'm not afraid.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.787
We do a drill like this
at school every day.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.989
Ben, put a chair
in front of the door.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.392
Everybody stay away
from the windows.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.060
I'm going upstairs
to get my checklist.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.633
With all
the police around,

06:05.666 --> 06:07.300
the guy's probably
nowhere near us.

06:07.334 --> 06:10.003
But if it makes Mary feel better
to be in control,

06:10.037 --> 06:11.071
let's just do it.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.706
Well,
I'll tell you what --

06:12.740 --> 06:14.708
it really sucks that kids
even know how to do this.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.977
There's no place they can go
where they feel safe anymore.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.580
Yeah, no kidding. I wouldn't
want to be a kid these days,

06:19.613 --> 06:22.315
with the COVID
and online bullying,

06:22.349 --> 06:24.718
now random shootings.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.086
We used to go out
in the mornings

06:26.119 --> 06:27.688
and not come back
'til the night

06:27.721 --> 06:28.956
when the street lights
came on.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.291
Our parents didn't even know
where we were,

06:31.324 --> 06:33.026
and everybody
liked it that way.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.462
What are you
talking about?

06:34.495 --> 06:36.129
Being a kid
is still easy.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.898
You just have to accept
that everything sucks,

06:37.931 --> 06:39.467
and you can't
do anything about it.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.334
Harris,
that's awful.

06:41.368 --> 06:43.236
Don't you think that
there's young people out there

06:43.270 --> 06:45.906
who -- who are trying
to change things?

06:45.939 --> 06:48.141
Yeah, and they're
a bunch of suckers.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.177
Oh,
there's my little DNA.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.480
Speaking of DNA,
I'm actually relieved

06:52.513 --> 06:54.582
that Mark went
to the state capitol now.

06:54.615 --> 06:58.719
Yeah, 'cause no angry mob
ever storms a capitol.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.554
Ben!
Read the room!

07:05.826 --> 07:07.528
Why can't the cops
find this guy?

07:07.561 --> 07:09.029
It's not that easy.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.197
Crime's up everywhere.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.032
They're probably
spread pretty thin.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.801
I want
to hear this part.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.036
Oh, it's too loud.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.472
It sounds like the helicopter's
right over our house.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.207
Okay, fine.
No, it is.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.075
That's our street.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.044
God, that is
so embarrassing.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.345
One of
our hillbilly neighbors

07:25.378 --> 07:27.047
patched their roof
with a garbage bag

07:27.080 --> 07:28.682
held down by bricks.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.350
Well, you're right about
the hillbilly part.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.185
That's our house.

07:33.253 --> 07:35.188
That's how you fixed
the hole in our roof?!

07:35.222 --> 07:37.324
There was
a second hole,

07:37.357 --> 07:38.792
and there was
only one scenario

07:38.826 --> 07:40.193
where it could bite me
in the ass,

07:40.227 --> 07:41.562
and you're
looking at it.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.064
Well, at least he's not
on our block.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.398
They're moving away.

07:45.432 --> 07:48.201
Look at all the police
outside that house.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.971
That's on Lennox,
next to St. Luke's.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.372
Hey, that's the
McNolty house, right?

07:52.405 --> 07:54.374
That's only like a block
and a half away from here.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.810
Maybe he's, like,
hiding in the backyard.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.679
Oh, man.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.180
I hope
he didn't bust in

08:00.213 --> 08:02.049
and he's holding people hostage
in there.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.717
Again?

08:03.751 --> 08:06.887
Were you this clueless
when I was dating you?

08:06.920 --> 08:08.689
Yeah,
I think I was.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.861
Dan,
I know I wasn't here,

08:13.894 --> 08:16.964
but you really should've
talked to me first.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.232
This waterbed
is not staying.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.335
Okay.

08:22.369 --> 08:25.305
Okay, I'll give the bed
a chance.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.074
I'm sorry.
I didn't think.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.476
I should've warned you
I was getting this out.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.880
You really think
you're gonna need it?

08:32.913 --> 08:35.182
I hope not.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.790
Where are Beverly Rose
and Emilio?

08:42.823 --> 08:44.057
They can't get through
the police line,

08:44.091 --> 08:47.060
so they're staying at Emilio's.
It's safer there.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.295
Becky, look.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.397
They're showing
a picture of the shooter.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.065
It's James McNolty.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.702
Not James.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.137
He was always nice to me,
he always said, "Hi,"

08:57.170 --> 08:59.707
he shoveled
people's walkways.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.541
I went to school
with him.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.543
He had issues,
but we all do.

09:03.577 --> 09:04.712
There are other kids

09:04.745 --> 09:06.446
I would've expected to go off
before him.

09:07.581 --> 09:11.151
Aw, man,
the McNolty kid's the shooter?

09:11.184 --> 09:14.154
He used to deliver our paper.
I want to hear this.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.890
Is that a gun?!
What the hell, Grandpa?!

09:16.924 --> 09:17.958
You still have
that thing?

09:17.991 --> 09:20.360
Okay, I want it
out of here now.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.963
No. He's a block
and a half away.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.198
He jumps a fence, he's looking
for a place to hide,

09:25.232 --> 09:27.334
he comes through that door,
I'm gonna be ready.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.969
Ready for what,
Dad?

09:29.002 --> 09:31.138
You got some kind of fantasy of
a shootout in the living room?

09:31.171 --> 09:33.006
What if somebody breaks in
while you're sleeping?

09:33.040 --> 09:34.174
You gonna sleep
with the gun, too?

09:34.207 --> 09:35.709
Don't worry.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.711
I'll have that lockbox open,
and I'll be shooting

09:37.745 --> 09:39.913
before your father
even stops snoring.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.148
Are you insane?

09:41.181 --> 09:43.483
We're the ones
wandering around the house

09:43.516 --> 09:45.018
in the middle
of the night.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.820
You got a better chance
of shooting one of us

09:46.854 --> 09:47.855
than anybody else.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.222
Just get rid
of the gun!

09:49.990 --> 09:51.992
Hey, everybody!
Mary's here.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.127
Uh, why don't we
turn off the TV?

09:54.161 --> 09:55.963
No, wait. Hold on. Hold --
Oh, it's almost over.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.731
He's coming out
with his hands up.

09:57.765 --> 09:58.999
Oh, thank God.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.201
Damn, no.
He's reaching for something.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.703
He's got a gun.

10:10.010 --> 10:13.013
Mary:
Is he dead?

10:13.046 --> 10:14.581
It's okay, honey.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.083
It's all over.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.958
I'm reading an article
about the shootings.

10:24.992 --> 10:28.195
Did you know we live in
a "rapidly decaying suburb"?

10:28.228 --> 10:31.331
Ooh!
We're a "suburb"!

10:31.364 --> 10:32.733
Really, Dan?

10:32.766 --> 10:35.168
I just watched
a kid get shot yesterday.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.205
You know,
I saw the same thing myself,

10:38.238 --> 10:40.373
but I still have to
go to work today,

10:40.407 --> 10:42.009
put a smile
on my face,

10:42.042 --> 10:43.911
and help the customers
find the right drill bit.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.146
So if I have to joke around
a little to get through today,

10:46.179 --> 10:47.380
let me have that.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.718
Good morning, everybody.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.519
There's my
little princess!

10:52.552 --> 10:53.987
Come on, Dad.
I'm in my 40s.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.522
It's embarrassing.

10:55.555 --> 10:57.991
He means me, Mommy.

10:58.025 --> 11:00.060
I know, sweetie.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.930
Okay.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.013
S-So,
at the end of this,

11:20.047 --> 11:23.083
do you just dip her face
in the bowl, or what?

11:23.116 --> 11:25.819
What's the problem?
I love holding my baby.

11:25.853 --> 11:26.920
Honey,
you haven't put her down

11:26.954 --> 11:29.022
since Emilio
brought her home last night.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.124
It just happened.
Give me a break.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.793
Mommy,
I want to get down.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.795
I have to
go potty.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.064
Alone this time.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.869
Leave the door open.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.037
The poop fairies
have to let me know

11:44.071 --> 11:46.073
if you deserve
a gold star.

11:46.106 --> 11:48.241
When I leave the door open,
I get yelled at.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.143
Where's <i>my</i> gold star?

11:50.177 --> 11:53.513
Hey.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.982
You doing okay?

11:55.015 --> 11:58.318
Um, I didn't sleep,
so I'm awake,

11:58.351 --> 12:00.587
and I'm...
looking at my phone,

12:00.620 --> 12:02.089
and it's everywhere.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.490
Yeah.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.158
Beverly Rose: Mommy,
I couldn't go.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.960
Can I watch TV?

12:06.994 --> 12:08.962
Too much fiber,
not enough fiber.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.397
I can't handle this.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.068
Beverly Rose,
your papa's here.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.004
Hey, honey.

12:17.037 --> 12:19.172
We had a real adventure
yesterday, didn't we?

12:19.206 --> 12:21.008
What's going on?

12:21.041 --> 12:23.510
Did you forget? I'm taking her
to Phoebe's birthday party.

12:23.543 --> 12:24.845
That's today?

12:25.913 --> 12:28.248
Okay,
the roof's fixed.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.683
Now we just got to get
that helicopter back overhead

12:30.717 --> 12:33.153
so we can show off
my impeccable craftsmanship.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.155
One of you
needs to commit a crime.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.756
Hey.

12:36.790 --> 12:39.059
I'm glad
you didn't get shot, buddy.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.161
Yeah, me, too.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.731
Are you ready
to go to the party?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.133
Yes!

12:46.166 --> 12:47.868
I don't think
it's a good idea

12:47.901 --> 12:49.569
to go
to Phoebe's party, honey.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.072
That's not fair.
I wanna go.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.673
You're gonna go, <i>mija.</i>

12:53.706 --> 12:55.342
Jackie: Come on,
Beverly Rose,

12:55.375 --> 12:57.144
let's go find something
in the house that we don't want

12:57.177 --> 12:58.278
and you can give to
your little friend.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.183
I know
you're worried,

13:03.216 --> 13:05.052
but I think it'd be good for her
to see her friends.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.354
But she's still traumatized
from yesterday.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.222
Becky,
she's okay.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.791
I never let her know
what was going on.

13:11.825 --> 13:14.627
I think you might be the one
who's traumatized.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.563
Of course I am.

13:16.596 --> 13:19.566
Yesterday, I saw my daughter
dead in my mind.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.469
You were there,
you knew what was going on.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.737
I was here, powerless.

13:24.771 --> 13:27.007
I never want
to feel that way again.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.475
I don't, either.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.011
I'll never forget
hiding in that bathroom,

13:31.044 --> 13:32.745
listening for footsteps,

13:32.779 --> 13:34.982
praying that it was the police,
not the shooter.

13:35.015 --> 13:38.351
We need
to deal with our fear

13:38.385 --> 13:40.988
and not keep her
from having a childhood.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.990
I know,
but the idea

13:43.023 --> 13:45.959
of being away
from Beverly Rose terrifies me.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.995
And I can't drink.

13:48.028 --> 13:51.131
That is so not fair
for a parent.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.732
The police
sent me an e-mail.

13:52.765 --> 13:55.002
The city set up
free trauma counseling

13:55.035 --> 13:56.169
at the rec center.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.205
They also have
free aqua-robics classes,

13:58.238 --> 14:00.173
but that's not
because of the shooting --

14:00.207 --> 14:01.508
that's any time.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.712
Okay.

14:05.745 --> 14:08.315
Beverly Rose,
let's go!

14:08.348 --> 14:10.250
You're gonna be late
for the party.

14:11.584 --> 14:14.387
We're bringing Phoebe
an ashtray!

14:15.355 --> 14:18.325
Bye, honey!
Have fun.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.760
Don't worry
about Mommy.

14:23.763 --> 14:26.699
Mm.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.035
Well,
it was either that

14:28.068 --> 14:30.003
or your dad's
lumbar pillow.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.242
Hey.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.476
Why aren't you
dressed for school?

14:36.509 --> 14:37.744
We're gonna be late.

14:37.777 --> 14:39.246
I don't want
to go to school.

14:40.347 --> 14:43.984
Okay.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.852
Look, I get it.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.855
What you saw
was something

14:48.888 --> 14:51.091
that nobody should ever
have to see.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.194
We can be
a little late today.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.029
Why don't we
talk about it?

14:57.097 --> 14:59.032
I saw them
kill James.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.301
I know
he did something terrible,

15:01.334 --> 15:03.036
but I feel bad
for him.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.905
And I feel bad for the person
at the mall.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.808
They were just shopping,
and they got shot.

15:08.841 --> 15:11.144
I know.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.513
Yeah, I mean, it's terrible
when anybody gets killed.

15:13.546 --> 15:18.918
Sometimes things happen
and they don't make sense.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.020
But if
I leave the house,

15:20.053 --> 15:21.654
that could happen to me,
right?

15:21.688 --> 15:23.056
No.

15:23.090 --> 15:27.027
You are going to be
perfectly safe.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.996
How do you know that?

15:30.063 --> 15:32.732
Because I just know.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.002
I can tell
when you're lying.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.170
I'm not
going to school.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.083
Is Mary gonna join us
for dinner?

15:50.117 --> 15:51.184
No.

15:51.218 --> 15:52.652
I'm gonna
give her some space

15:52.685 --> 15:54.154
and bring her
a plate.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.522
Is she going
to school tomorrow?

15:55.555 --> 15:56.990
No.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.725
And I feel horrible
for lying to her.

15:58.758 --> 16:01.061
She asked me
if she was gonna be safe,

16:01.094 --> 16:03.330
and I said yes,
because what else can you say?

16:03.363 --> 16:04.998
But, you know,
I don't know.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.199
Well, she can't
keep missing school.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.534
What are you gonna do?

16:07.567 --> 16:08.968
I don't know.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.137
I mean,
I tried to get her in

16:10.170 --> 16:11.738
to see
the school psychologist --

16:11.771 --> 16:13.173
this is
gonna blow you away.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.408
Our school district
has one psychologist

16:15.442 --> 16:17.277
for 1,500 students.

16:18.411 --> 16:21.414
Well,
maybe some of those students

16:21.448 --> 16:23.750
will grow up
to be psychologists.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.052
I mean,
it's ridiculous.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.487
The next time
the psychologist is scheduled

16:27.520 --> 16:30.323
to be at Mary's school
is two weeks from Tuesday. Mm.

16:30.357 --> 16:33.093
How am I supposed to make her
feel safe in the meantime?

16:33.126 --> 16:34.961
Well,
whatever you do,

16:34.994 --> 16:36.663
don't send her
to the rec center.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.398
There was a line
around the block

16:38.431 --> 16:40.167
to see
three counselors.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.403
They say it's free,
but I missed four hours of work,

16:43.436 --> 16:45.004
and I never
got to see anybody.

16:45.038 --> 16:47.840
Daughters. Wife.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.576
Crone.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.010
Don't even.

16:51.044 --> 16:53.146
I am not the one.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.182
Dad,
where's the gun?

16:55.215 --> 16:57.417
Locked safely away.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.086
I got
a curious 3-year-old

16:59.119 --> 17:00.187
who gets
into everything.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.554
I gotta know
where it is.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.523
It's in a drawer
in a lockbox

17:03.556 --> 17:06.759
with a combination
that nobody knows but me.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.228
Oh, come on, Dan.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.730
Everybody in Chicago
has the same combo.

17:10.763 --> 17:13.032
It's the year
the Bears won the Super Bowl.

17:13.066 --> 17:15.668
1985.
1985.1985.
1985.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.138
Well, now I have to change
all my passwords.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.240
But don't worry --

17:20.273 --> 17:23.042
there's no way anybody's
getting near that gun.

17:23.076 --> 17:26.346
Got your money.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.415
What's that for?

17:28.448 --> 17:30.350
I sold your gun.
You what?!

17:31.351 --> 17:32.885
Took your gun
to the police station,

17:32.919 --> 17:34.121
and they gave me
that cash for it.

17:35.288 --> 17:38.358
Wow.
Yeah. Gutsy.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.127
Nice knowing you.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.130
What happened to the whole,
"the world's screwed

17:43.163 --> 17:45.165
and there's nothing
you can do about it"?

17:45.198 --> 17:46.633
The world <i>is</i> screwed.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.302
But when something like this
happens in your backyard,

17:49.336 --> 17:50.737
you have
two choices.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.005
I can either hide
and bitch like a little punk

17:53.039 --> 17:55.742
or get up off my ass
and do something like a boss.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.044
You guys...

17:58.077 --> 18:00.747
Oh, Jackie,
it's gonna be okay.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.182
They're gonna
work it out.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.083
No, it's not --
it's --

18:04.117 --> 18:06.085
It's just
so overwhelming

18:06.119 --> 18:07.587
when I see
a young person

18:07.620 --> 18:09.856
doing something good
in this world,

18:09.889 --> 18:11.591
because there's
so much violence

18:11.624 --> 18:13.393
and there's
so much misery.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.628
And...
when I'm on my phone,

18:15.662 --> 18:17.063
it --
it's just everywhere.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.132
They --
They don't even let you

18:19.166 --> 18:21.368
get up
off the ground.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.570
Hey, exactly how much
of this stuff

18:23.603 --> 18:25.004
are you watching
every night?

18:25.037 --> 18:26.072
I don't --

18:26.105 --> 18:27.840
Well,
according to my phone,

18:27.874 --> 18:32.044
my screen time is like
around nine hours a day.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.747
You're doom-scrolling
every night.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.583
No wonder you're a raw nerve
all the time.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.885
Watch a cat wrestle a monkey
every once in a while.

18:40.019 --> 18:41.588
You're a mess.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.156
You shouldn't be alone.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.324
You're sleeping
here tonight.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.658
Yeah, okay, thanks.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.059
I wi--

18:47.093 --> 18:48.995
I'm gonna --
I'm gonna go make up the couch.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.332
And I just want to say
how sweet it is...
Just go.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.801
...that you're all
so understanding is what I --

18:54.834 --> 18:55.835
Go.

18:59.406 --> 19:02.675
Now we talk.

19:02.709 --> 19:05.144
You had no right
to take my property.

19:05.178 --> 19:07.180
Dad, we don't need
an argument right now.

19:07.214 --> 19:09.316
No, no, no.
This isn't enough.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.184
I just
want to tell Harris

19:11.218 --> 19:12.919
that she is gonna
make up the difference.

19:14.053 --> 19:16.223
Now, I don't agree
with what you did,

19:16.256 --> 19:18.191
but I get
why you did it.

19:19.058 --> 19:21.494
Okay, well, I'm glad
you finally understand --

19:21.528 --> 19:24.030
Harris, you're juggling
chainsaws here.

19:24.063 --> 19:27.400
Just take the limbs
you still have and walk away.

19:34.073 --> 19:36.209
Beverly Rose,
should I go all-in?

19:36.243 --> 19:37.610
Yes.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.680
Ah!

19:40.713 --> 19:42.181
You set me up!

19:42.215 --> 19:44.884
Who are you
working with?!

19:44.917 --> 19:46.486
Who wants apple pie?

19:46.519 --> 19:48.020
Finally.
Me!

19:48.054 --> 19:49.188
I'll have a piece.

19:49.222 --> 19:51.224
Hey!
Hey, Mary!
Hey, Mary!

19:51.258 --> 19:53.025
Come over here.

19:53.059 --> 19:55.728
I'll share
my sleeping bag with you.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.865
This is great.
You feel better?

19:58.898 --> 20:00.367
Maybe a little.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.901
I like
that we're all together.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.970
Me, too.

20:04.003 --> 20:07.039
Hey, doom-scroller,
hand it over.

20:07.073 --> 20:09.909
Yeah, I got so much
tequila in me,

20:09.942 --> 20:12.545
I don't even know
what I'm looking at anyway.

20:14.113 --> 20:17.116
A sleepover
was a really good idea.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.987
What are
we gonna do tomorrow?

20:21.020 --> 20:22.989
We'll deal with tomorrow tomorrow.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.062
Oh.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.900
Hi.
Hey, there, Dan.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.167
Libby Lewis.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.003
We live
about a block and a half down.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.638
How you doing?

20:38.671 --> 20:40.072
Hi, Libby. Hi.

20:40.106 --> 20:41.908
We're doing...okay.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.576
Been a rough
couple days. Yeah.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.378
How you doing?
Getting by.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.414
We're going around
the neighborhood

20:47.447 --> 20:51.050
collecting funds for the family
of the mall victim.

20:52.118 --> 20:54.421
I have a dollar.

20:54.454 --> 20:57.189
You know,
it just so happens, Libby,

20:57.223 --> 20:58.691
I got
some extra cash.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.092
Here you go.

21:00.126 --> 21:01.561
Thank you.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.732
Okay, cough it up.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.402
Uh, I only have
a twenty.

21:10.370 --> 21:11.704
Oh, uh...

21:11.738 --> 21:13.239
Oh, look a that --
another twenty.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.208
'Cause it's
the right thing to do.
