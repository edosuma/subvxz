needs to be gone.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.286
That guy didn't win.
You need to be fired,"

10:53.320 --> 10:57.124

just losing his job.

and that's hard.

anybody starting them up!

haven't quit.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.167
They believe the team can rally.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.502
...to finish in victory.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.270

12:17.304 --> 12:19.372

is win one, right?

12:19.406 --> 12:21.374

we're gonna make the playoffs,

**

13:14.394 --> 13:17.030
I had a good conversation
last night

13:17.064 --> 13:20.868
with one
of your fellow gold jackets,

13:20.901 --> 13:22.302
Dickerson.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.938
-What about him?
-Well, I had to address it

13:24.972 --> 13:26.239
'cause he had been
chewing on us.

13:26.273 --> 13:27.540
Oh, really?

13:27.574 --> 13:29.209
I mean,
he'd just tear us up

13:29.242 --> 13:32.479
and then call and ask
for five pregame warm-up passes.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.948
So I had to --
It was really good.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.050
It was like, you know,
it was kind of one of those,

13:37.084 --> 13:39.419
"I take the high road here,
but listen --

13:39.452 --> 13:41.354
You can't have it
both ways.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.556
You know, you can criticize us
and do whatever.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.926
You're fine
to say whatever you want,

13:45.959 --> 13:49.029
but you can't come back and ask
for pregame warm-up passes."

13:49.062 --> 13:50.230
Yeah.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.531
Jeff: I made the call

13:51.564 --> 13:55.168
and got an amazing text
back from him.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.905
And then, after that,
I don't know what happened.

13:57.938 --> 14:01.008
Tell us what happened
between you and Fisher.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.409
Dickerson: I've been hearing
the rumbling around

14:02.442 --> 14:04.011
that they didn't care
for what I was saying

14:04.044 --> 14:05.312
about the team
and the coaches

14:05.345 --> 14:06.546
before the Dolphins game.

14:06.579 --> 14:07.981

Jeff Fisher says,

14:08.015 --> 14:09.382
"Hey, Eric,
this is Jeff Fisher."

14:09.416 --> 14:11.151
He said, "I just want
to say this to you --

14:11.184 --> 14:13.020
We, as the Rams, we're not gonna
be doing anything for you.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.022
We're not gonna be supporting
your organizations, you know,

14:15.055 --> 14:16.924

talking about the team,

14:16.957 --> 14:18.992
talking about the players and
expect us to do things for you.

14:19.026 --> 14:21.161
So I said, "As long
as you're head coach,

14:21.194 --> 14:23.130
you don't ever have to worry
about ever seeing me

14:23.163 --> 14:24.998

-No, no, it's not.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.104

14:31.138 --> 14:33.006
It's not.
-It's not a distraction?

14:33.040 --> 14:35.042
I mean, other than the fact
that we got to answer

14:35.075 --> 14:36.443

Like, I don't know.

14:36.476 --> 14:37.610
I don't know. You know?
-Right.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.229
I always have it
in my back pocket,

19:22.262 --> 19:23.730
and I put a new jacket on.

19:23.763 --> 19:28.735
I stuck it in the...pocket
and couldn't find it.

19:28.768 --> 19:32.171
Hamm: Jared Goff is having
trouble with the pocket, too.

19:33.640 --> 19:37.544
And though the Patriots
are pouring it on,

19:37.577 --> 19:39.779
the Rams have too much
self-respect

19:39.812 --> 19:42.649
to just roll over.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.565
Announcer #2:
There's no quit in this offense,
no quit in this football team.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.800
The score is lopsided,
but at least a touchdown

20:00.833 --> 20:02.635
is something
you can build off of.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.437
Announcer: Rams,
with 2 minutes to go to,

20:04.471 --> 20:06.373
have a field goal.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.275
They've got
96 total yards.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.243
Goff is gonna let it fly.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.312
He's got a great --
Wide open...

20:12.345 --> 20:13.680
Kenny Britt
makes the catch,

20:13.713 --> 20:15.515
still going,

20:15.548 --> 20:16.816
drops at the 1.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.718
Let's go.
Hurry up. Hurry up.

20:18.751 --> 20:19.986
Let's get it in.
Let's go.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.421
Get some points.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.423
Jared Goff, nice pass,

20:23.456 --> 20:25.525
hitting Kenny Britt
in stride.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.561
Well, there's a throw that
looked like a number-one pick.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.597
That was
a 66-yard play, John,

20:30.630 --> 20:34.601
so at least some positive
to take into the week.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.403
Goff bootlegs to his right,

20:36.436 --> 20:37.670
looking to the back
of the end zone.

20:37.704 --> 20:41.908
Kenny Britt -- touchdown!

20:41.941 --> 20:44.377
Jared Goff throws
a late touchdown

20:44.411 --> 20:45.745
here in Foxboro,

20:45.778 --> 20:48.481
but it's 26-10.

20:48.515 --> 20:49.849
New England defeats
Los Angeles.

20:49.882 --> 20:52.519
Good...old man.

20:52.552 --> 20:53.853
-Good game, Tom.
-Good luck to you, big guy.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.522
-Congratulations.
-Take care. Appreciate it.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.324
Thanks. Good luck.

20:59.392 --> 21:02.795
Hamm: At a certain point
in a lost season,

21:02.829 --> 21:05.332
it all starts to run together,

21:05.365 --> 21:07.967
one game after another.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.075
All right, man.
Let's go.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.744
-All right.
-Let's do it.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.513
Let's go.
Let's start fast.

21:20.547 --> 21:22.982
Come on!
Bring it the...out!

21:23.015 --> 21:24.717
Let's go, Mike!

21:24.751 --> 21:27.954
Announcer: Benny Cunningham
is inactive today.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.890
That's a tough break,
especially on special teams.

21:30.923 --> 21:35.495
It's Michael Thomas getting
the chance to return instead

21:35.528 --> 21:37.430
as he awaits the kick.

21:37.464 --> 21:39.098
We are underway.

21:39.131 --> 21:42.769
Thomas drops the opening kick
2 yards deep in his end zone,

21:42.802 --> 21:47.607
and the Falcons have recovered
at the 5 yard line.

21:47.640 --> 21:51.043
...

21:51.077 --> 21:55.114
Just an utter disaster
on the opening kick.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.950
As if the best offense
in the NFL needed any help,

21:57.984 --> 21:59.419
the Rams give it to them

21:59.452 --> 22:02.389
at 10 seconds
into the first period.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.757
It's 7-0 Falcons.

22:04.791 --> 22:06.058
Jeff: Let's go, boys!

22:06.092 --> 22:07.527
All right,
let's just chip away at it.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.828
Chip away at it.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.096
-Yep, yep.
-Good.

22:10.129 --> 22:13.900
**

22:19.171 --> 22:21.974
Announcer #2: Jared Goff,
this is his fourth start

22:22.008 --> 22:23.810
of his rookie year,

22:23.843 --> 22:26.413
still looking
for his first victory.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.517
Man: Hey, if you don't wipe it
for a little bit

22:30.550 --> 22:32.385
and let it run,

22:32.419 --> 22:34.153
then there will be some really
cool pictures of you later

22:34.186 --> 22:36.689
to hang up on the wall.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.124
You'll be really,
really tough,

22:38.157 --> 22:40.760
like a J.J. Watt
type picture, you know?

22:42.094 --> 22:45.865
All right. See you, kid.
Keep fighting, bro.

22:45.898 --> 22:48.000
Announcer #3: This offense is
gonna have to click

22:48.034 --> 22:49.436
and come alive.

22:49.469 --> 22:50.603
At some point,
you're gonna have

22:50.637 --> 22:53.172
to pay them back
with a touchdown.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.641
Announcer:
Inside handoff, Gurley --

22:54.674 --> 22:56.809
Hit in the hole,
he's going nowhere.

22:56.843 --> 22:59.178
Announcer #2: Sometimes, guys
will just press up too much,

22:59.211 --> 23:01.180
and, when that happens,

23:01.213 --> 23:04.584
nothing positive
comes out of it.

23:04.617 --> 23:07.887
Gurley had
nowhere to go.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.858
Goff is in the center.
He drops the throw.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.126
It's intercepted,
right side, Deion Jones.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.829
He goes in
for the pick-6.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.767
And the Rams are coming
unraveled here

23:20.800 --> 23:23.870
at the Coliseum
in week 14.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.739
21-0.

23:26.773 --> 23:29.041
That's horse...
what we just put out there!

23:29.075 --> 23:32.178
Now, let's find out what we're
about these next 30 minutes.

23:32.211 --> 23:33.780
Are we gonna respond,

23:33.813 --> 23:35.715
or are we gonna put
our head down and pout?

23:35.748 --> 23:38.050
Who's...pissed?
-I'm...pissed!

23:38.084 --> 23:39.819
Then let's...go!

23:39.852 --> 23:41.454
Get this...right now!

23:41.488 --> 23:44.190
Gurley: I'm tired of being
a...sorry-ass offense

23:44.223 --> 23:45.858
week after...week!

23:45.892 --> 23:47.760
Pick this...
the...up?

23:47.794 --> 23:50.129
If y'all ain't gonna get
the...out of this
locker room right now,

23:50.162 --> 23:52.231
don't come back
on that...field!

23:52.264 --> 23:54.233
...make mistakes.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.902
Mistakes are gonna
...happen,

23:55.935 --> 23:58.204
but not
every...time!

23:58.237 --> 24:01.608
...

24:01.641 --> 24:06.178
* Oh, father, tell me

24:06.212 --> 24:10.517
* Do we get what we deserve?

24:10.550 --> 24:12.719
Man: Come on now!
Hey, how we gonna respond?

24:12.752 --> 24:14.554
Hey, how we gonna respond?

24:14.587 --> 24:16.055
How we gonna respond?
Come on now.

24:16.088 --> 24:18.224
How we gonna respond?
Let's go.

24:18.257 --> 24:20.126
Announcer:
Ryan ready in the shotgun.

24:20.159 --> 24:24.063
* And way down we go

24:24.096 --> 24:26.032
Takes the handoff
to Coleman.

24:26.065 --> 24:28.635
Now going vertical,
deep over the middle.

24:28.668 --> 24:29.969
Wide open and hauled in.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.738
He can walk
into the end zone.

24:31.771 --> 24:37.677
* Say, way down we go

24:37.710 --> 24:43.983
* Way down we go

24:44.016 --> 24:50.122
* Whoa, you let
your feet run wild *

24:50.156 --> 24:55.528
* Time has come
as we all go down *

24:55.562 --> 24:57.163
Jared Goff
in the shotgun.

24:57.196 --> 24:59.265
* Whoa, whoa, baby

24:59.298 --> 25:00.933
Drops his throw.

25:00.967 --> 25:03.202
Pressure from his right side.
Ball comes out.

25:03.235 --> 25:04.571
It's Vic Beasley.

25:04.604 --> 25:06.873
Scoops and scores
from the 15.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.741
* Ohh, oh

25:08.775 --> 25:11.744
* And, baby

25:11.778 --> 25:13.546
Are you kidding me?

25:13.580 --> 25:18.985
* Yeah, till you can't crawl
no more *

25:19.018 --> 25:25.592
* And way down we go

25:25.625 --> 25:29.996
* Way down we go
So the Rams will finish
below 500

25:30.029 --> 25:31.798
for the 10th
consecutive season.

25:31.831 --> 25:34.233
* Way down we go

25:34.266 --> 25:37.036
This is their first year
in L.A.

25:37.069 --> 25:39.706
* Way down we go

25:39.739 --> 25:42.842
Tough to watch
for Ram fans --

25:42.875 --> 25:46.112
not easy in any way,
shape or form.

25:46.145 --> 25:49.081
* Ooh, ooh

25:49.115 --> 25:52.284
* Way down we go

25:52.318 --> 25:54.854
**

25:54.887 --> 25:57.223
Here's the challenge, okay?

25:57.256 --> 26:00.226
If you care about each other,

26:00.259 --> 26:02.328
care about yourselves,

26:02.361 --> 26:05.231
sounds like
if you care about me,

26:05.264 --> 26:07.834
we'll suck it up

26:07.867 --> 26:11.704
'cause we're on a freaking
airplane in three days.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.673
And if there's any situation
where you've had

26:13.706 --> 26:16.843
to put one behind you as fast
as you can and move forward,

26:16.876 --> 26:19.245
this is it, okay?

26:19.278 --> 26:21.848
We'll get started tomorrow
and get a plan,

26:21.881 --> 26:24.116
and we'll go,
and we'll go up.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.853
All we got is
the next game right now, okay?

26:26.886 --> 26:28.220
Tune it out.
Tune it out.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.822
Unfortunately,
we're playing in four days,

26:29.856 --> 26:32.859
so tune this...out
is what you've got to do.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.927
If you care about us,

26:34.961 --> 26:38.865
let's make a difference here
in the next 4 days, okay?

26:38.898 --> 26:43.836
Hayes: Hey, that put our...
livelihood on the line, bro.

26:43.870 --> 26:46.272
Deep...now
'cause I'm telling you,

26:46.305 --> 26:48.007
if change happens,

26:48.040 --> 26:49.909
it ain't
just one person leaving, bro.

26:49.942 --> 26:53.145
...bringing in
their own people.

26:53.179 --> 26:55.682
And the...we doing,
that's what's gonna happen, man.

26:55.715 --> 26:58.718
And that ain't on him.
It's on us.

26:58.751 --> 27:01.187
Brother put us before
he put himself,

27:01.220 --> 27:03.322
and this is how
we're...repaying him, man.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.057
Y'all don't realize
how...good we got

27:05.091 --> 27:06.993
till a new...come in
and they don't want

27:07.026 --> 27:09.796
not one of you...
around here.

27:09.829 --> 27:11.263
We're gonna go
back to...work, man.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.199
And all the...
we've been doing,

27:13.232 --> 27:14.333
that...got to change, man.

27:14.366 --> 27:16.068
It's got to.

27:16.102 --> 27:17.704
And that...got to start
...this week, man.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.005
We're gonna grind
this...out, man,

27:19.038 --> 27:20.172
and we're gonna
have fun doing it now.

27:20.206 --> 27:22.141
-Yes, sir.
-Hey, "family" on three.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.776
One, two, three -- Family.
-Family!

27:28.047 --> 27:30.883
Man: So it was a 42-14 win
that the Falcons had.

27:30.917 --> 27:33.252
Not only was it dead,
but people were angry,

27:33.285 --> 27:36.789
and they are just totally off
and over this current Rams team,

27:36.823 --> 27:39.025
like, not even -- just period.

27:39.058 --> 27:42.829
**

27:44.130 --> 27:45.998
Watching the Rams,
right now, oh, my.

27:46.032 --> 27:48.267
And it's the foreseeable future.

27:48.300 --> 27:51.337
Like, how can this not change?

28:03.816 --> 28:05.184
Jeff: Hey, everybody.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.256
Yes, sir.

28:11.991 --> 28:16.362
Okay, you're gonna have
some challenges this weekend

28:16.395 --> 28:19.966
with respect to injuries.

28:19.999 --> 28:25.071
Reggie will keep you abreast.

28:25.104 --> 28:29.475
Unfortunately,
I won't be there this weekend.

28:29.508 --> 28:32.745
I was just fired.

28:32.779 --> 28:35.481
So, um...

28:35.514 --> 28:39.786
I'm gonna have
an 11:30 team meeting.

28:39.819 --> 28:41.187
Then, I'm going
to tell the players.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.990
I don't want you to say
anything to the players.

28:44.023 --> 28:46.125
Keep it to yourself, okay?

28:46.158 --> 28:50.196
I was told that there
won't be any changes but me.

28:50.229 --> 28:54.000
We'll finish out the season
as a staff.

28:54.033 --> 28:55.534
No one else is going.

28:55.567 --> 29:00.406
And help each other
and support each other, okay?

29:00.439 --> 29:03.309
I'm gonna do my best
to hold it together

29:03.342 --> 29:05.344
and thank the team.

29:05.377 --> 29:08.981
So, um...

29:09.015 --> 29:10.449
I appreciate everything

29:10.482 --> 29:12.852
[ Voice breaking ]
you guys have done

29:12.885 --> 29:15.021
for this football team

29:15.054 --> 29:16.388

29:16.422 --> 29:19.025
and the loyalty
that you've shown,

29:19.058 --> 29:23.029
um, but, uh,
it's a freaking shock.

29:26.498 --> 29:29.501
Sorry if I let you guys down.

29:29.535 --> 29:31.037
You guys didn't let me down.

29:31.070 --> 29:34.540
You busted your ass
every single day for me.

29:34.573 --> 29:37.276
I'm sorry.

29:37.309 --> 29:40.279
So...

29:44.550 --> 29:46.819
-You're a good man.
-Thank you.

29:55.361 --> 29:59.098
I will do whatever I can
for every single one of you.

30:01.633 --> 30:05.371
I will be there for you

30:05.404 --> 30:10.009

Going out, man.
...it.

30:20.419 --> 30:22.154
Going out.
Don't do it for me.

30:22.188 --> 30:24.523
Do it for yourselves.

-Huh?

-Sorry, man.
-No, hey.

30:40.272 --> 30:43.409
They made a choice.
It was at the top.

30:43.442 --> 30:46.445
