02:00.396 --> 02:02.363
The king, Hundra, had a hundred

toes.

02:17.529 --> 02:18.496
'Aqua Teen'"?

02:18.529 --> 02:19.163
What's that?

02:19.196 --> 02:20.463
Shake: Hundred episodes.

02:20.496 --> 02:21.696
That's the magic number for

02:21.730 --> 02:23.063
syndication cash.

02:23.096 --> 02:24.396
Frylock: What are you talking

02:24.430 --> 02:25.063
about, Shake?

02:25.096 --> 02:25.996
Shake: You don't read the

02:26.030 --> 02:26.696
trades?

02:26.730 --> 02:27.663
Frylock: I don't know what

02:27.696 --> 02:28.696
you're talking about, but

02:28.730 --> 02:29.830
somehow I think it relates to

02:29.863 --> 02:30.496
us.

02:30.530 --> 02:31.563
Shake: Uh, yeah, you know

02:31.596 --> 02:31.963
what?

02:31.996 --> 02:32.630
I doubt it.

02:32.663 --> 02:33.996
In fact, it's probably some

02:34.030 --> 02:35.496
other Aqua Teens entirely.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.030
It's a common name.

02:37.063 --> 02:38.696
All right, look, I gotta go.

02:40.896 --> 02:43.030
You told me this was episode 3,

02:43.063 --> 02:44.430
which means I've been doing

02:44.463 --> 02:45.630
episode 3 for eight freakin'

02:45.663 --> 02:46.663
years!

02:46.696 --> 02:47.863
Actors just get, uh, so

02:47.896 --> 02:49.330
immersed in their characters

02:49.363 --> 02:50.696
that they lose track of time and

02:50.730 --> 02:51.396
space.

02:51.430 --> 02:53.063
Shake: How dare you talk to

02:53.096 --> 02:54.563
me about my craft?!

02:54.596 --> 02:57.063
100 episodes is syndication.

02:57.096 --> 02:59.370
That's where I cash in!

02:59.403 --> 03:00.503
I know it, and you know it.

03:00.536 --> 03:01.770
The show's 11 minutes long,

03:01.803 --> 03:04.870
so, really, you have only 50

03:04.903 --> 03:05.603
half-hours.

03:05.636 --> 03:06.970
Shake: We can -- we can pad

03:07.003 --> 03:07.436
it.

03:07.470 --> 03:08.270
I can do magic.

03:08.303 --> 03:09.470
He's saying we're only

03:09.503 --> 03:10.536
halfway there, buddy.

03:10.570 --> 03:11.970
Shake: Who asked you?

03:12.003 --> 03:13.403
I just did a voiceover for

03:13.436 --> 03:14.803
kitty litter that paid more than

03:14.836 --> 03:16.403
this piece of has paid,

03:16.436 --> 03:17.436
and I get residuals!

03:17.470 --> 03:18.636
The cat's where it's at.

03:18.670 --> 03:19.903
Shake: You are fired!

03:19.936 --> 03:21.370
And I'll see you jackals in

03:21.403 --> 03:22.403
another eight years!

03:22.436 --> 03:23.770
And I'm gonna have another 50

03:23.803 --> 03:24.436
ready!

03:24.470 --> 03:25.936
Open up the bank book, boys,

03:25.970 --> 03:27.770
'cause I'll be back.

03:29.836 --> 03:30.970
Meatwad: Where you been for

03:31.003 --> 03:31.736
like three days?

03:31.770 --> 03:33.403
Shake: Hey, let's just joke

03:33.436 --> 03:34.770
around and entertain 18- to

03:34.803 --> 03:36.003
34-year-olds, shall we?

03:36.036 --> 03:37.270
Pick a card, any card.

03:37.303 --> 03:37.970
Come on, pick one.

03:38.003 --> 03:39.403
Meatwad: Look, I can't be

03:39.436 --> 03:40.103
doing that.

03:40.136 --> 03:41.436
Frylock's out front mowing the

03:41.470 --> 03:42.570
number 100 into the lawn.

03:44.336 --> 03:46.603
We need to get him some help,

03:46.636 --> 03:47.636
have an intervention or

03:47.670 --> 03:48.270
something.

03:48.303 --> 03:49.370
Shake: Look, he's gonna

03:49.403 --> 03:50.003
resist it.

03:50.036 --> 03:50.936
You know how proud he is.

03:50.970 --> 03:52.636
That's why I think we should

03:52.670 --> 03:53.836
frame him for murder!

03:53.870 --> 03:54.836
Meatwad: Well, let's find

03:54.870 --> 03:55.736
some middle ground here.

03:55.770 --> 03:56.803
I mean, maybe we could have an

03:56.836 --> 03:57.870
intervention and then frame him

03:57.903 --> 03:58.570
for murder?

03:58.603 --> 03:59.743
Shake: Look, you can't open

03:59.776 --> 04:00.776
a candy store and sell

04:00.810 --> 04:02.376
hamburgers out the back and be a

04:02.410 --> 04:03.743
scientist and an animal-trainer

04:03.776 --> 04:04.343
school.

04:04.376 --> 04:05.043
Just doesn't work.

04:05.076 --> 04:06.176
Meatwad: Well, what the hell

04:06.210 --> 04:06.876
does that mean?

04:06.910 --> 04:08.343
Shake: Means do one thing,

04:08.376 --> 04:09.276
and do it right.

04:09.310 --> 04:10.743
Now, get out there with this

04:10.776 --> 04:12.410
bloody ax and say, "Ooh, I did

04:12.443 --> 04:13.043
it.

04:13.076 --> 04:14.210
Oh, God, why did I do it?"

04:14.243 --> 04:15.343
Meatwad: Okay, I'll do it,

04:15.376 --> 04:16.476
but ain't you trying to frame

04:16.510 --> 04:17.375
Frylock for murder?

04:17.410 --> 04:18.676
Shake: Yeah, you better get

04:18.709 --> 04:19.676
him to say it, too.

04:19.709 --> 04:21.410
Mmm.

04:21.442 --> 04:23.410
Yep, this is the stuff.

04:23.443 --> 04:23.976
Hot sauce.

04:24.010 --> 04:25.210
Meatwad: I did it.

04:25.243 --> 04:26.343
Oh, oh, God, I did it.

04:26.376 --> 04:27.676
Good thing this wasn't blood.

04:27.710 --> 04:28.910
I'd be licking aids right now.

04:28.943 --> 04:29.943
Meatwad: I did it, y'all.

04:29.976 --> 04:30.743
Oh, God, I did it.

04:30.776 --> 04:31.776
Hey, these body parts are

04:31.810 --> 04:32.309
plastic.

04:32.343 --> 04:32.976
Shake: Damn it!

04:33.009 --> 04:34.443
Listen, you digital a-hole!

04:34.476 --> 04:36.243
I had those made in hollywood.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.876
I'm a member of the unions, and

04:37.909 --> 04:39.510
I'm a trained professional.

04:39.543 --> 04:40.776
Now do your job, sir!

04:40.810 --> 04:42.843
Feels like a hundred degrees

04:42.876 --> 04:44.176
out.

04:44.210 --> 04:45.576
Time for lunch.

04:45.610 --> 04:46.676
It's 1:00.

04:46.710 --> 04:48.443
Hey, can we have a hundred

04:48.476 --> 04:49.543
beans for lunch?

04:49.576 --> 04:51.476
No, tom, I've told you for

04:51.510 --> 04:53.443
the 100th time -- no one sells

04:53.476 --> 04:54.710
beans individually.

04:54.743 --> 04:56.576
It's just not efficient.

04:56.610 --> 04:58.210
Man, I feel like I haven't

04:58.243 --> 04:59.350
had beans in a century.

04:59.383 --> 05:00.783
What about cascade of beans on

05:00.816 --> 05:01.750
100 100th street?

05:01.783 --> 05:02.616
100 100th?

05:02.650 --> 05:03.850
A hundred, a hundred.

05:03.883 --> 05:04.650
100, 100.

05:04.683 --> 05:05.283
100.

05:05.316 --> 05:05.883
100, 100.

05:05.916 --> 05:06.550
100.

05:06.583 --> 05:08.150
Uh-oh, I've got to take a

05:08.183 --> 05:08.650
10-100.

05:08.683 --> 05:09.516
100, a hundred.

05:09.550 --> 05:10.650
100, 100, 100.

05:10.683 --> 05:11.616
A hundred!

05:11.650 --> 05:12.783
100, a hundred, 100.

05:13.750 --> 05:14.616
100, 100, 100.

05:14.650 --> 05:15.750
We'd better go.

05:15.783 --> 05:19.483
Both: See you soon.

05:19.516 --> 05:21.383
Frylock: "See you soon"?

05:21.416 --> 05:22.616
"c" is the roman numeral for

05:22.650 --> 05:23.183
100!

05:23.216 --> 05:23.883
Did you hear all that?

05:23.916 --> 05:25.350
Shake: I think that cop was

05:25.383 --> 05:26.016
Tom Savini.

05:26.050 --> 05:26.883
Frylock: 100 -- they kept

05:26.916 --> 05:27.650
saying "100," man!

05:27.683 --> 05:28.283
It's coming!

05:28.316 --> 05:29.250
Meatwad: What's coming?

05:29.283 --> 05:30.316
Frylock: I don't know, but I

05:30.350 --> 05:31.016
don't like it.

05:31.050 --> 05:31.850
Shake: Hey, jerkwater, you

05:32.170 --> 05:32.903
cruising for sex?

05:33.995 --> 05:35.466
Get your stinkin' zeroes off my

05:35.466 --> 05:36.133
lawn.

05:36.166 --> 05:36.866
It's not

05:36.899 --> 05:39.933
nice to talk to strangers!

05:39.966 --> 05:40.933
Frylock: Damn it, it's him!

05:40.966 --> 05:41.699
Meatwad: It's who?

05:41.733 --> 05:42.733
Frylock: It's the number 100.

05:42.766 --> 05:43.766
Don't look him in the eyes, man.

05:43.799 --> 05:46.331
Be a good boy, and give me

05:46.331 --> 05:47.565
the episode!

05:47.598 --> 05:48.665
Frylock: Episode?

05:48.698 --> 05:49.903
What the hell does he mean?

05:49.903 --> 05:51.369
Shake: This is episode 100,

05:51.403 --> 05:52.903
and if we finish this show,

05:52.936 --> 05:54.236
he'll collect our epi-souls

05:54.269 --> 05:54.936
forever!

05:54.969 --> 05:56.503
I don't know -- that's just what

05:56.536 --> 05:57.169
I think!

05:57.203 --> 05:58.169
I'm speculating!

05:58.203 --> 05:58.969
Frylock: Show?!

05:59.003 --> 05:59.943
What do you mean, show?!

05:59.976 --> 06:00.909
Shake: Hello?

06:07.043 --> 06:08.209
Meatwad: What the hell you

06:08.209 --> 06:09.109
talkin' about, fool?

06:09.143 --> 06:10.176
Shake: They sell all our

06:55.846 --> 06:58.346
Isn't that right, fly boy?

06:58.379 --> 06:59.413
Frylock: It's Flylock.

06:59.446 --> 07:00.453
I mean, Fryrock.

07:00.486 --> 07:01.719
I mean -- damn it, who am I?

07:01.753 --> 07:03.286
Meatwad: And why am I a dog

07:03.319 --> 07:03.819
now?

07:03.853 --> 07:04.719
Shake:

07:04.753 --> 07:05.953
you're meaty meaty moo!

07:05.986 --> 07:07.719
Do your thing, meaty!

07:07.753 --> 07:09.586
Meatwad: Meaty meaty moo.

07:09.619 --> 07:10.753
Shake: Come on, really?

07:10.786 --> 07:11.719
That was terrible.

07:11.753 --> 07:12.953
Meatwad: I just think it's

07:12.986 --> 07:14.453
stupid that that's all I would

07:14.486 --> 07:15.286
say is my name.

07:15.319 --> 07:16.319
Like that's an exclamation?

07:16.353 --> 07:17.219
Like that conveys any

07:17.253 --> 07:17.786
information?

07:17.819 --> 07:18.553
Shake: Don't worry.

07:18.586 --> 07:19.553
We're gonna work on it over

07:19.586 --> 07:20.086
time.

07:20.819 --> 07:21.919
Frylock: What the are

07:21.953 --> 07:22.853
we doing here, Shake?

07:22.886 --> 07:23.819
Shake: We're having

07:23.853 --> 07:24.853
adventures where we solve

07:24.886 --> 07:25.953
mysteries and uncover high

07:25.986 --> 07:26.453
jinks.

07:26.486 --> 07:27.453
Right, Tabitha?

07:27.486 --> 07:29.319
J-j-j-jinkies, Captain.

07:29.353 --> 07:30.453
Shake: Jinkies, indeed.

07:30.486 --> 07:31.719
Frylock: Who's this bitch?

07:31.753 --> 07:32.486
Uh, jinkies.

07:32.519 --> 07:33.753
Shake: Don't you dare speak

07:33.786 --> 07:34.953
to my dear girlfriend who we

07:34.986 --> 07:35.986
travel with but I'm not

07:36.019 --> 07:37.286
physically involved with...

07:37.319 --> 07:37.986
Like that.

07:38.019 --> 07:38.953
Carl: Yeah, 'cause you ain't

07:38.986 --> 07:39.653
man enough.

07:39.686 --> 07:40.819
Shake: You hang out by the

07:40.853 --> 07:41.486
van.

07:41.519 --> 07:42.419
You're not a part of this so

07:42.453 --> 07:43.119
much.

07:43.153 --> 07:43.819
Carl: I don't want to be a

07:43.853 --> 07:44.519
part of this.

07:44.553 --> 07:45.619
Shake: Good, 'cause you're

07:45.653 --> 07:46.253
not.

07:46.286 --> 07:46.886
Carl: I know, I'm not.

07:46.919 --> 07:47.719
Shake: Well, then,

07:47.753 --> 07:48.453
why don't you go?

07:48.486 --> 07:49.386
Carl: Well, I am going.

07:49.419 --> 07:50.419
Shake: You're not walking.

07:50.453 --> 07:51.353
Carl: I will walk away.

07:51.386 --> 07:52.353
I'm walking away right now.

07:52.386 --> 07:53.386
Shake: Pick it up, fat boy!

07:53.419 --> 07:54.053
Carl: I heard you.

07:54.086 --> 07:55.719
Mes enfants, la chanson,

07:55.753 --> 07:56.419
oignon.

07:56.453 --> 07:57.086
Whoo-ee!

07:57.119 --> 07:58.019
Carl: Hey, hey, hey, hey!

07:58.053 --> 07:59.386
Back --

07:59.419 --> 08:00.493
Shake: Zoinks!

08:00.526 --> 08:02.826
Jinkies!

08:02.859 --> 08:06.693
Je te plumerai!

08:06.726 --> 08:07.926
Shake: Blinkus!

Shake: Pa-dinkus!

08:15.193 --> 08:15.859
Jinkies!

08:15.893 --> 08:17.326
Frylock: Man, how long do we

08:17.359 --> 08:18.159
have to do this?

08:18.193 --> 08:19.159
Shake: Ah, relax.

08:19.193 --> 08:20.426
We got like nine more minutes

08:20.459 --> 08:21.126
left.

08:21.159 --> 08:21.926
We'll just go till the credits

08:21.959 --> 08:22.693
hit.

08:22.726 --> 08:25.393
Garantie!

08:25.426 --> 08:26.526
Shake: Ka-blingus!

08:26.559 --> 08:27.693
Frylock: Nah, I'm done

08:27.726 --> 08:28.659
running, man.

08:28.693 --> 08:29.659
Shake: Don't, don't, don't!

08:29.693 --> 08:32.726
Je te plumerai!

08:32.759 --> 08:34.259
Garantie!

08:34.293 --> 08:35.493
Jinkies!

08:35.525 --> 08:36.693
Frylock: Somebody staple the

08:36.726 --> 08:38.193
talk-hole on that bitch, please.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.426
Shake: It was the number 100

08:39.458 --> 08:40.092
all along!

08:40.126 --> 08:41.926
He followed us into our new

08:41.958 --> 08:42.659
show!

08:42.693 --> 08:44.659
And I would have succeeded,

08:44.693 --> 08:46.726
too, if it weren't for the fact

08:46.759 --> 08:47.726
that I failed!

08:47.759 --> 08:48.926
100 dressed like the

08:48.959 --> 08:50.559
bayou boo-ya so he could scare

08:50.593 --> 08:52.193
you back into your old world,

08:52.226 --> 08:53.459
where he could seize you,

08:53.493 --> 08:54.926
collect your episodes, and sell

08:54.959 --> 08:56.259
them to a network for

08:56.293 --> 08:56.893
syndication.

08:56.926 --> 08:58.526
What is she doing here?

08:58.559 --> 08:59.359
Jinkies!

08:59.393 --> 09:00.333
Man, come on!

09:00.366 --> 09:02.199
Am I supposed to know you?

09:02.233 --> 09:03.399
Shake: It doesn't work that

09:03.433 --> 09:04.099
way.

09:04.133 --> 09:05.166
There are 11 minutes, so we only

09:05.199 --> 09:06.266
really technically have 50

09:06.299 --> 09:06.833
half-hours.

09:06.866 --> 09:07.766
We don't have a hundred.

09:07.799 --> 09:09.599
What about doubling them?

09:09.633 --> 09:11.099
Reruns?

09:11.133 --> 09:12.499
People do that.

09:12.533 --> 09:13.399
Shake: Yeah, I know.

09:13.433 --> 09:14.133
I said that, too.

09:14.166 --> 09:14.866
They wouldn't go for it.

09:14.899 --> 09:17.299
Well, can I at least take her

09:17.333 --> 09:19.399
into the woods, rape her, and

09:19.433 --> 09:21.633
behead her, possibly not even in

09:21.666 --> 09:22.633
that order?

09:22.666 --> 09:23.499
Uh, jinkies?

09:23.533 --> 09:25.066
Shake: I don't know, man.

09:25.099 --> 09:25.699
Better not.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.166
She came with the van, and

09:27.199 --> 09:28.599
there's, like, a deposit issue

09:28.633 --> 09:30.133
and...

09:30.166 --> 09:32.766
So you're Aqua unit patrol

09:32.799 --> 09:34.166
squad now?

09:34.199 --> 09:35.266
Shake: 'fraid so, yeah.

09:35.299 --> 09:36.833
Really?

09:36.866 --> 09:38.466
That's what you're going with?

09:38.499 --> 09:39.866
Shake: We're gonna solve

09:39.899 --> 09:41.366
mysteries, and we live in

09:41.399 --> 09:42.799
seattle now, where I think I

09:42.833 --> 09:44.366
also host a radio program.

09:44.399 --> 09:46.266
So do you have a commitment

09:46.299 --> 09:47.366
beyond the pilot?

09:47.399 --> 09:48.366
Meatwad: I don't know any

09:48.399 --> 09:49.233
more than you do, man.

09:49.266 --> 09:50.433
We're thinking about losing the

09:50.466 --> 09:51.133
dog.

09:51.166 --> 09:51.833
I don't know what that means.

09:51.866 --> 09:53.199
'cause I think this works.

09:53.233 --> 09:54.366
What are you doing?!

09:54.399 --> 09:55.666
I hope you get to do more.

09:55.699 --> 09:56.266
Really.

09:56.299 --> 09:56.833
Oh!

09:56.866 --> 09:58.099
This has been fun.

09:58.133 --> 09:59.299
Let go of me!

09:59.333 --> 10:00.406
No!

10:02.273 --> 10:04.173
Meatwad: Meaty meaty moo!

10:04.206 --> 10:06.073
And meaty meaty moo to you,

10:06.106 --> 10:06.506
too!

10:11.173 --> 10:12.539
Shake:

10:12.573 --> 10:13.739
see? Wow, it's funny!

10:13.773 --> 10:15.639
That's funny to me even watching

10:15.673 --> 10:16.539
it, and I was there.

10:16.573 --> 10:18.373
"Can I rape her and behead

10:18.406 --> 10:19.773
her, possibly not in that

10:19.806 --> 10:20.473
order?"

10:20.506 --> 10:21.673
Shake: Yeah, and I will speak

10:21.706 --> 10:22.506
to him about that.

10:22.539 --> 10:23.673
Yeah, we really don't want a

10:23.706 --> 10:24.706
main character that wants to

10:24.739 --> 10:25.273
rape.

10:25.306 --> 10:26.173
Shake: You're right.

10:26.206 --> 10:27.639
We want kids to buy his toy and

10:27.673 --> 10:28.439
not fear it.

10:28.473 --> 10:29.439
And you know what?

10:29.473 --> 10:30.706
We can schedule a reshoot.

10:30.739 --> 10:32.239
That is -- I mean, that's a

10:32.273 --> 10:32.806
phone call.

10:32.839 --> 10:35.339
But it's funny, right?

10:35.373 --> 10:36.673
Yeah, it's just a little too

10:36.706 --> 10:38.206
close to another project that we

10:38.239 --> 10:39.473
have coming down the pipeline

10:39.506 --> 10:40.606
that's already like this.

10:40.844 --> 10:42.411
Shake: Right.

10:42.444 --> 10:43.644
So, how about doing, like, a

10:43.678 --> 10:44.944
rock block of them together?

10:44.978 --> 10:45.844
Be a power house.

10:45.878 --> 10:46.744
All right, dana.

10:46.778 --> 10:49.744
It was great talking to you.

10:49.778 --> 10:51.044
Come in any time to bore us.

10:51.078 --> 10:52.344
My door is always open.

10:52.378 --> 10:53.544
Shake: I can come back after

10:53.578 --> 10:54.244
3:00.

10:54.278 --> 10:55.678
I got a space pirate thing I'm

10:55.711 --> 10:56.844
making up right now.

10:56.878 --> 10:58.944
Okay, um...How do I say this?

10:58.978 --> 10:59.718
How do I say this?

10:59.751 --> 11:00.918
Shake: I'm just gonna get a

11:00.951 --> 11:02.032
bag of pretzels at the vending

11:02.032 --> 11:02.648
machine.

11:02.648 --> 11:04.712
Everything you say bores us.

11:04.712 --> 11:08.145
You know what I mean?

11:08.145 --> 11:09.245
Shake: Do you have 75 cents?

11:09.279 --> 11:10.545
I don't have any change.
