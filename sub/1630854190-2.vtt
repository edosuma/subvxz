<i> Previously on</i>
So Help Me Todd...

00:10.845 --> 00:12.746
I am a private detective.
You were.

00:12.781 --> 00:13.813
I lost my job.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.518
Two years ago.

00:15.553 --> 00:16.519
TODD:
<i> Mom, are you okay?</i>

00:16.554 --> 00:18.818
I think Harry has left me.

00:18.853 --> 00:20.259
HARRY:
<i> Your mother loves you.</i>

00:20.294 --> 00:21.821
Why do you think
she spent two years

00:21.856 --> 00:23.823
fighting the city, trying
to reinstate your license?

00:23.858 --> 00:25.330
There is one thing
I could do for you

00:25.365 --> 00:26.595
to help you get back
on your feet.

00:26.630 --> 00:29.235
You're a detective again.
An investigator.

00:29.270 --> 00:30.665
And this is your bus pass.

00:30.700 --> 00:32.370
TODD:
<i> I will wear the tie,</i>

00:32.405 --> 00:35.406
but I will not take the bus.

Lyle? Hey.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.475
Top o' the morning, partner.

02:17.510 --> 02:18.608
No food in here.

02:18.643 --> 02:21.215
I don't have any.
I'm just...

02:21.250 --> 02:24.680
Which office was Nadia's,
the investigator I'm replacing?

02:24.715 --> 02:26.253
That office has been repurposed

02:26.288 --> 02:28.222
as a hold site for
closed case files,

02:28.257 --> 02:30.455
broken office equipment
and junk.

02:30.490 --> 02:33.359
Oh, junk. Okay. All right.

02:33.394 --> 02:35.559
So, uh, where's my office?

02:38.861 --> 02:40.861
LYLE:
And so, first things first.

02:40.896 --> 02:42.731
This cabinet in particular is
off-limits to you.

02:42.766 --> 02:43.897
Do not open it.

02:43.932 --> 02:44.931
The lights are
motion-activated,

02:44.966 --> 02:46.702
so this switch does nothing.

02:46.737 --> 02:49.936
And until a cubicle opens up,
this will have to do.

02:49.971 --> 02:51.938
Well, do I get a chair?

02:56.549 --> 02:58.945
Top o' the morning, partner.

03:01.587 --> 03:03.455
What am I, a tailor?

03:04.557 --> 03:06.854
Ridiculous.

03:08.429 --> 03:09.428
(scoffs)

03:09.463 --> 03:11.265
(footfalls approaching)

03:18.571 --> 03:19.933
Oh.

03:26.381 --> 03:29.316
And I guess I'll see you in
an hour for the deposition.

03:29.351 --> 03:30.911
Thanks, Susan.

03:30.946 --> 03:32.715
(chuckles)

03:32.750 --> 03:34.981
I mean, hey, he could have
put you in the parking lot.

03:35.016 --> 03:36.917
Or the restroom.
Yeah, or in hell.

03:36.952 --> 03:39.359
(chuckles)

03:39.394 --> 03:42.461
Wow, that ring really is
a supernova.

03:42.496 --> 03:44.760
You were never getting
anything like that from me.

03:45.763 --> 03:47.796
(both chuckle)

03:50.669 --> 03:52.504
So, are you excited
for your mom's big case?

03:52.539 --> 03:53.835
What big case?

03:53.870 --> 03:55.408
The mayor sex scandal thing.

03:55.443 --> 03:58.477
What mayor sex scandal thing?

03:58.512 --> 04:00.413
Todd, the mayor
of Portland

04:00.448 --> 04:02.316
and the woman accusing him
of a lurid affair?

04:02.351 --> 04:04.010
A lurid affair?

04:04.045 --> 04:06.045
He's denying it.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.948
His wife is pulling
an Alicia Florrick

04:07.983 --> 04:09.653
and standing by him.

04:09.688 --> 04:11.358
But Lexy here claims that
things were hot and heavy,

04:11.393 --> 04:13.591
and she has some of the mayor's
personal items as proof.

04:13.626 --> 04:15.593
Now she's suing him
for breach of contract.

04:15.628 --> 04:16.990
$5 million.

04:17.025 --> 04:18.365
Wait, this is my mom's case?

04:19.267 --> 04:21.830
And I'll be working it?
As an investigator.

04:21.865 --> 04:25.097
Me. A big scandal
with the mayor?!

04:25.132 --> 04:26.703
Well, you were hired to work
her cases, and this is...

04:26.738 --> 04:28.738
Yes! I'm back!

04:35.516 --> 04:37.010
Mom, amazing.

04:37.045 --> 04:38.484
Big scandal, so exciting.

04:38.519 --> 04:39.782
Okay, I'm already
diving into it.

04:39.817 --> 04:41.850
And this mayor seems
super sketchy to me.

04:41.885 --> 04:44.358
I mean, look at that.
Can they be real?

04:44.393 --> 04:47.625
(scoffs)
There's got to be some
serious dark secrets in there.

04:47.660 --> 04:49.121
Maybe he's got some people

04:49.156 --> 04:51.464
chained up in a subterranean
basement somewhere.

04:51.499 --> 04:52.729
Todd?
Huh?

04:52.764 --> 04:54.434
The mayor is our client.

04:54.469 --> 04:56.964
We are defending him
at all costs.

04:56.999 --> 04:58.999
Okay.
But is that one of
the ties I bought you?

04:59.034 --> 05:01.067
(laughs)
You look very handsome.

05:01.102 --> 05:02.706
Yeah, without the tie.

05:02.741 --> 05:03.608
Wait, what do you mean
we're defending the mayor

05:03.643 --> 05:04.873
at all costs?

05:04.908 --> 05:06.138
Like, even if he did it?

05:06.173 --> 05:07.843
Even if he's a psychopath

05:07.878 --> 05:09.812
and throwing baby bunnies
into campfires?

05:09.847 --> 05:10.879
Yes.
Okay.

05:10.914 --> 05:12.419
Fine. Then I'll start

05:12.454 --> 05:15.114
with the woman Lexy Fawcett.

05:15.149 --> 05:17.688
I'll watch her, I'll tail her.
I'll quietly surveil her.

05:17.723 --> 05:19.525
Hey, does having this job
allow me to make

05:19.560 --> 05:20.856
law-abiding citizen's arrests?

05:20.891 --> 05:22.154
Todd.
Uh-huh?

05:22.189 --> 05:24.827
This is a very
important day for me.

05:24.862 --> 05:28.501
I have worked here
for over 17 years.

05:28.536 --> 05:31.097
I generate 31%
of this firm's income.

05:31.132 --> 05:34.672
And now it is time
for the senior partners

05:34.707 --> 05:38.643
to recognize my value
and put my name above that door.

05:38.678 --> 05:43.417
Crest, Folding, Song and Wright.

05:43.452 --> 05:46.178
Which is why I need to tap
all my resources

05:46.213 --> 05:47.553
and clear the mayor's name

05:47.588 --> 05:48.587
and win this case.

05:48.622 --> 05:50.490
Great. Where do I start?

05:50.525 --> 05:52.151
There's a woman
in Southeast Portland

05:52.186 --> 05:53.658
named Jacqueline DuBois.

05:53.693 --> 05:55.088
Her basement flooded
because of

05:55.123 --> 05:56.628
the city water main break,

05:56.663 --> 05:58.597
and many, many of her
belongings were damaged.

05:58.632 --> 06:00.126
Okay. Okay.

06:00.161 --> 06:02.733
And I need you to go down
and observe that trial.

06:02.768 --> 06:04.438
I want to know everything.

06:04.473 --> 06:06.132
Evidence, witnesses, testimony.

06:06.167 --> 06:07.903
This is your first case,

06:07.938 --> 06:09.971
and I am sure
you're going to ace it.

06:10.006 --> 06:13.106
Wait. Where's the high-profile
sex scandal in this assignment?

06:13.141 --> 06:14.943
That's what I'll be doing.

06:14.978 --> 06:17.044
You are doing the legwork
for my next case

06:17.079 --> 06:18.584
when I represent
Jacqueline's neighbors

06:18.619 --> 06:20.014
in a very similar lawsuit.

06:20.049 --> 06:21.818
What?!
Mm-hmm.

06:21.853 --> 06:24.986
I took this job
to work real cases.

06:25.021 --> 06:27.857
No, I gave you this job
because you are broke.

06:27.892 --> 06:30.728
I want murders, kidnapping,
blackmail, not water damage.

06:30.763 --> 06:33.863
I mean, who-who's investigating
the mayor, the woman, the sex?

06:33.898 --> 06:36.503
Here's the preliminary report
on Alexis "Lexy" Fawcett.

06:36.538 --> 06:38.472
I'll have more
on her financials in a moment.

06:38.507 --> 06:40.606
Excellent. Thank you, Lyle.

06:41.609 --> 06:44.940
Him? Poindexter?

06:44.975 --> 06:46.546
Todd, you're still
learning the ropes here,

06:46.581 --> 06:48.009
and this is the mayor.

06:48.044 --> 06:49.516
We need our top people on this.

06:49.551 --> 06:50.880
I'm not one of your top people?!

06:50.915 --> 06:52.486
My top people don't show up
33 minutes late.

06:52.521 --> 06:54.686
Who told you I was thir...?

06:54.721 --> 06:56.556
Oh, my God.

06:56.591 --> 06:57.887
Mom, this is crazy.

06:57.922 --> 07:00.186
You can't stick me
with this dead-end case!

07:00.221 --> 07:02.694
Todd, Jacqueline's trial
is at 10:00 a.m.
Don't Todd me, Margaret.

07:02.729 --> 07:04.729
You will not be
late to that, too,
if you want a ride home

07:04.764 --> 07:05.862
tonight from your mother.
Your ace detective
went out of his way

07:05.897 --> 07:07.061
to find your missing husband?

07:08.702 --> 07:11.505
Fine. Have fun
with your hall monitor.

07:15.709 --> 07:19.942
Alistair Song wants to see you
in the conference room. Now.

07:21.814 --> 07:23.979
Alistair.

07:24.014 --> 07:26.850
Hello, Margaret. Have a seat.

07:26.885 --> 07:28.720
Thank you.

07:28.755 --> 07:31.756
You know, I was just
mentioning you

07:31.791 --> 07:33.593
and my position here...

07:33.628 --> 07:35.056
What's this about

07:35.091 --> 07:36.695
you hiring your son?

07:36.730 --> 07:38.290
My son?
Wasn't he involved

07:38.325 --> 07:42.261
in some illegal
wiretapping situation

07:42.296 --> 07:45.836
a few years ago?
And now he's working here?

07:45.871 --> 07:48.036
Yes. My son. Todd.

07:48.071 --> 07:50.973
Well, as I'm sure you know,
we had an opening

07:51.008 --> 07:52.271
in the investigations
department,

07:52.306 --> 07:54.009
and he was cleared

07:54.044 --> 07:56.308
of those charges
that you mentioned.

07:56.343 --> 07:59.817
Todd is an excellent detective.

07:59.852 --> 08:02.787
I have seen his work up close.

08:02.822 --> 08:04.657
Very close.

08:04.692 --> 08:08.694
But can we trust him
not to embarrass us?

08:09.697 --> 08:11.994
Yes, we can trust him.

08:12.029 --> 08:15.866
In fact, now that I'll be busy
with the mayor's case, I...

08:15.901 --> 08:17.934
The mayor's case?

08:17.969 --> 08:20.101
Uh, yes.

08:20.136 --> 08:22.268
The mayor, the scandal. I...

08:22.303 --> 08:24.974
Margaret, I'll be taking lead
on the mayor's case.

08:25.009 --> 08:27.614
I've already spoken
to his office, and...
What?

08:27.649 --> 08:29.748
Uh, he's my client.

08:29.783 --> 08:32.245
I-I joined the board
of the art museum a year ago

08:32.280 --> 08:34.280
to befriend his wife
and-and bring their business

08:34.315 --> 08:36.887
to this firm.
He's only...
Margaret.

08:36.922 --> 08:38.889
It's the mayor.

08:38.924 --> 08:41.122
We need our top people on this.

08:43.159 --> 08:46.600
You've come so far
here, Margaret.

08:46.635 --> 08:51.132
It seems like just yesterday
that, uh, you were my secretary.

08:51.167 --> 08:52.936
Executive secretary.

08:52.971 --> 08:56.104
And I look forward
to making space for you

08:56.139 --> 08:58.975
here at the top.

08:59.010 --> 09:01.010
Someday.

09:01.045 --> 09:03.782
Alistair,

09:03.817 --> 09:06.983
with all due respect,

09:07.018 --> 09:09.986
I have the relationships,
I've done the background.

09:10.021 --> 09:13.055
This is my case.

09:13.090 --> 09:16.828
Well, um,
maybe you could be useful then.

09:16.863 --> 09:19.127
Uh, as my second chair.

09:19.162 --> 09:20.931
Oh...

09:20.966 --> 09:23.934
I'm so sorry to interrupt,
but the mayor's team is here.

09:23.969 --> 09:26.101
Hey. Hi. We can't wait.
We got to get going

09:26.136 --> 09:27.773
on this, kids, okay?

09:27.808 --> 09:29.643
Oh, Margaret, isn't this awful?

09:29.678 --> 09:32.173
This hideous woman making
horrible accusations.

09:32.208 --> 09:35.209
Thank God you'll be
helping us through this.

09:35.244 --> 09:36.243
(Alistair clears throat)
Oh.

09:36.278 --> 09:39.653
Um, Elaine and Mr. Mayor,

09:39.688 --> 09:41.347
I will be right
by your side.

09:41.382 --> 09:45.758
But-but we have decided that
one of our founding partners

09:45.793 --> 09:50.191
would be better equipped to
handle a case of this magnitude.

09:50.226 --> 09:53.392
This is... Alistair Song.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.130
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Mr. Mayor.

09:55.165 --> 09:58.166
Under very strange
circumstances.

09:58.201 --> 09:59.805
This is my campaign manager
Moe Simms.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.268
Yeah, okay.

10:01.303 --> 10:03.072
We got an election in four
short weeks, my friends.

10:05.373 --> 10:08.044
I want to assure you all
that we will mount

10:08.079 --> 10:11.311
a strong defense against this
flimsy, opportunistic lawsuit.

10:11.346 --> 10:12.884
MOE:
That's right.

10:12.919 --> 10:15.689
So, how are we
gonna bury her?

10:15.724 --> 10:18.219
Uh, well, we have our tried
and true means and, uh...

10:18.254 --> 10:21.222
Breach of oral contract
is very difficult to establish

10:21.257 --> 10:24.357
unless there's written proof
that the mayor was planning

10:24.392 --> 10:26.997
to financially support her
or leave his wife.

10:27.032 --> 10:29.164
Uh, Margaret, I've never
actually met this woman.

10:29.199 --> 10:30.836
I never promised
to leave my wife.

10:30.871 --> 10:32.739
None of this is true.

10:32.774 --> 10:35.775
We'll overwhelm her with
an expensive countersuit,

10:35.810 --> 10:39.174
and she'll fold,
I guarantee it.

10:40.177 --> 10:41.341
And?

10:42.344 --> 10:43.915
And?

10:43.950 --> 10:46.445
We have already requested
an ex parte hearing

10:46.480 --> 10:48.447
for later this afternoon.
Of course,

10:48.482 --> 10:50.185
you won't have to be there.
ALISTAIR:
That's right.

10:50.220 --> 10:52.055
But she will.

10:52.090 --> 10:53.859
I want this woman
to have to come down

10:53.894 --> 10:56.862
and face the judge.
(crying)

10:58.294 --> 11:02.263
Oh, Elaine. Elaine, shh.
It's okay. It's okay.

11:02.298 --> 11:04.837
It'll be all right.

11:04.872 --> 11:07.301
We will get through this.

11:07.336 --> 11:09.842
Together.

11:09.877 --> 11:15.309
Now, this is Christine "Chrissy"
De Pointe, a Parisian flapper,

11:15.344 --> 11:19.082
and she was made in 1935

11:19.117 --> 11:21.381
from very fine,
delicate porcelain.

11:21.416 --> 11:25.957
Now, can you see this little
brown stain here on her skirt?

11:25.992 --> 11:27.453
Here, right here,

11:27.488 --> 11:29.191
down near the hem?

11:29.226 --> 11:32.095
That was caused
by the water damage.

11:32.130 --> 11:34.328
This doll used to be worth

11:34.363 --> 11:37.034
at least $250,

11:37.069 --> 11:39.432
and now she's garbage.

11:40.234 --> 11:45.141
Your Honor, that was exhibit
number nine of... 117

11:45.176 --> 11:47.044
exhibits.

11:52.018 --> 11:53.985
Don't... die.

11:54.020 --> 11:57.153
No. This-this is your fault.

11:57.188 --> 11:59.287
This is not my fault.

11:59.322 --> 12:00.992
You dragged me into this.

12:01.027 --> 12:02.928
Lexy?

12:02.963 --> 12:05.326
You never said anything about
me getting hauled into court.

12:05.361 --> 12:09.429
You promised me 20,000 bucks.

12:09.464 --> 12:11.497
I only did this
for the money.

12:11.532 --> 12:14.170
Look... I have to go in

12:14.205 --> 12:15.809
and see some
stupid judge now.

12:15.844 --> 12:18.240
I'm done. Bye.

12:20.981 --> 12:23.014
(sighs)

12:29.957 --> 12:32.155
(whispering):
What are you doing here?

12:32.190 --> 12:33.189
(whispering):
I'm just...

12:33.224 --> 12:35.257
(mouthing)

12:36.260 --> 12:37.556
Go.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.129
(whispering):
Okay. I'm going.

12:39.164 --> 12:43.001
Back to the Valley
of the Dolls.

12:43.036 --> 12:45.069
TODD:
<i> Allison, can you believe</i>

12:45.104 --> 12:48.204
Mom stuck me with this junk
case? Me? She doesn't value me.

12:48.239 --> 12:50.239
She doesn't trust me.
After what I did for her?

12:50.274 --> 12:53.011
I have incredible skills
that are just being ignored.

12:53.046 --> 12:55.079
117 dolls. Give me a break.

12:55.114 --> 12:57.081
Yeah, but you're earning money,
you're working.

12:57.116 --> 13:00.150
Maybe you can get out of my
garage in, like, maybe a month,

13:00.185 --> 13:01.613
you think?
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

13:01.648 --> 13:05.254
This is about respect,
of which she is giving me none.

13:05.289 --> 13:07.091
Maybe the way to look at this

13:07.126 --> 13:09.126
is, you've reached
a crossroads in life.
Uh-huh.

13:09.161 --> 13:10.930
You hit bottom.
I haven't hit bottom!

13:10.965 --> 13:14.098
You lost your P.I. license
and you almost went to jail.

13:14.133 --> 13:16.298
Oh, my God. I've hit bottom.

13:16.333 --> 13:18.003
But now you're working your way
back up,

13:18.038 --> 13:21.171
and this job is a lifeline,
okay?

13:21.206 --> 13:24.174
So you need to suck it up,
pull yourself together,

13:24.209 --> 13:25.604
and stick it out.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.144
So you're saying I need...

13:27.179 --> 13:29.278
to find myself in this job?

13:29.313 --> 13:30.642
Um, yeah, okay, sure.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.446
I need to be true to myself

13:32.481 --> 13:34.085
and get out from under.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.219
Yes...?
Yeah, she can't tell me
what to do.

13:36.254 --> 13:38.221
I'm a detective. I detect!

13:38.256 --> 13:40.256
I'm not observing
water-damaged dolls.

13:40.291 --> 13:42.324
No, you're misinterpreting this.
No, you're right.

13:42.359 --> 13:45.261
I'm hers from 9:00 to 5:00,
but I'm mine from 5:00 to 9:00.

13:45.296 --> 13:47.263
Yeah, not understanding me.
I got to go.

13:47.298 --> 13:49.133
I'm gonna look
into this Lexy person on my own.

13:49.168 --> 13:50.563
She was on the phone
with someone at the courthouse,

13:50.598 --> 13:52.466
and I don't know. Something.

13:52.501 --> 13:54.336
Thank you.
No.

13:54.371 --> 13:57.504
(running footfalls)
No. No. Okay, no.

13:57.539 --> 13:59.572
That's not
what I was saying at all.

13:59.607 --> 14:01.574
(siren wailing)

14:01.609 --> 14:03.642
(dog barking in distance)

14:14.193 --> 14:15.995
Pizza.
MAN:
Who?

14:16.030 --> 14:17.425
Pizzeria Pizza here.
WOMAN:
I didn't order a pi...

14:17.460 --> 14:19.196
Peter Pete's Pizza.
WOMAN 2:
Pizza?

14:19.231 --> 14:20.461
Peter Pita's Pizza Palace?
MAN 2:
Yo, who dis?

14:20.496 --> 14:21.594
Pizza.
MAN 3:
Hey, bring it up!

14:21.629 --> 14:23.530
Hey, pi...
(buzzer sounds)

14:24.533 --> 14:26.973
Hey, I got pizza here.

14:27.008 --> 14:29.569
Pizza?

14:34.015 --> 14:35.476
Uh, Ms. Fawcett?

14:35.511 --> 14:37.676
I have your pizza
that you ordered...

14:37.711 --> 14:40.085
for pizza.

14:41.748 --> 14:44.188
Hello?

14:44.223 --> 14:46.256
Pizza?

14:52.660 --> 14:54.693
Uh, Lexy?

14:54.728 --> 14:58.235
Ms. Fawcett?

14:58.270 --> 15:00.237
Hello?

15:00.272 --> 15:03.042
Uh, I'd like to ask you
a few questions...

15:09.578 --> 15:11.611
(gasps loudly)

15:16.354 --> 15:18.387
♪ ♪

15:26.298 --> 15:28.133
The mayor is
a murder suspect now.

15:28.168 --> 15:30.003
We need to quickly pivot

15:30.038 --> 15:31.334
to a criminal defense.

15:31.369 --> 15:32.698
Can you please
sit down now?

15:32.733 --> 15:34.667
(sighs)
Thank you.

15:34.702 --> 15:37.505
May I ask you,
where was the mayor last night?

15:37.540 --> 15:39.144
And his wife?

15:39.179 --> 15:41.278
And you. Were you...?

15:41.313 --> 15:43.676
They're questioning the mayor
later today.

15:43.711 --> 15:47.020
And if this escalates,
there's a process

15:47.055 --> 15:49.319
for charging an elected official
with a crime.

15:49.354 --> 15:51.552
Uh, Margaret, will you get

15:51.587 --> 15:53.554
volume 19 of the Oregon

15:53.589 --> 15:55.523
Penal Code from the credenza?

15:55.558 --> 16:00.396
It's, uh, volume 14.

16:00.431 --> 16:03.201
(knocking)
(whispering): Hi.

16:03.236 --> 16:04.268
What are you doing?

16:04.303 --> 16:05.467
I need to talk to you.

16:05.502 --> 16:07.469
What are you doing?

16:07.504 --> 16:09.141
(whispering indistinctly)

16:10.705 --> 16:12.606
Mom.
What are you doing?

16:12.641 --> 16:14.674
So, there's been a bit
of a, uh, development.

16:14.709 --> 16:16.412
What is it now?
Um, the woman Lexy,

16:16.447 --> 16:17.809
who is...
Yes.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.250
Um, I think
I kind of found the body.

16:19.285 --> 16:21.087
And I tipped off
the police. I know.

16:21.122 --> 16:22.649
I know. I know I said
I wanted a murder case,

16:22.684 --> 16:25.157
but then there she was,
bam, murdered, and...

16:25.192 --> 16:27.192
Todd, you have to speak
to the police right now.

16:27.227 --> 16:29.062
We have to...
No, no, no, no, no,
let's not do that.

16:29.097 --> 16:31.592
I don't want them to know I
was there or that I took this.

16:31.627 --> 16:34.100
You took evidence
from the scene of the crime?
No. No, no.

16:34.135 --> 16:35.596
This evidence was definitely
outside the crime scene.

16:35.631 --> 16:37.136
It's her trash.

16:37.171 --> 16:38.335
She was taking it out.
No.

16:38.370 --> 16:39.798
This is illegal.
Okay, but you said

16:39.833 --> 16:41.536
that we have to defend
the mayor at all costs.

16:41.571 --> 16:43.406
And look what I found.
No, no, no, don't you open that.

16:43.441 --> 16:46.475
Todd, do not...
You want me to open this. Mom!

16:48.809 --> 16:50.710
(sighs)

16:54.518 --> 16:57.552
Okay, so, there's
all this gross stuff

16:57.587 --> 16:59.290
and this weird, uh,
"quit smoking" nicotine gum.

16:59.325 --> 17:00.621
I cannot believe
that you just...

17:00.656 --> 17:02.722
Wait. Are those
men's underpants?

17:02.757 --> 17:05.296
Yes, these, but she lived alone,

17:05.331 --> 17:06.759
so what
if they were the mayor's?

17:06.794 --> 17:10.103
Wait. She did say she had
some of his personal items.

17:10.138 --> 17:11.533
Are you sure
this is her trash?

17:11.568 --> 17:13.436
Yes!
Okay.

17:13.471 --> 17:15.735
Well, no. I think so. It might
have been the neighbor's.

17:15.770 --> 17:18.111
I don't know. The bag was
tipped slightly to the...

17:18.146 --> 17:20.212
You know, trash bag science
is not exact, and I...
Oh!

17:20.247 --> 17:22.379
My God. You have just dumped
a stranger's trash

17:22.414 --> 17:24.282
all over the office floor?!

17:24.317 --> 17:25.679
Those could be
anyone's underpants!

17:25.714 --> 17:27.384
Do we know
what waist size the mayor is?

17:27.419 --> 17:29.485
Oh, for...

17:31.456 --> 17:33.522
We need to find out

17:33.557 --> 17:36.426
when the police forensics
will be released.

17:36.461 --> 17:39.132
And please have someone
organize some food.

17:39.167 --> 17:42.267
We'll be here all day.
Of course.

17:45.272 --> 17:46.568
Perfect.

17:46.603 --> 17:47.899
Organize some food?

17:47.934 --> 17:49.868
You're organizing food?
What is going on?

17:49.903 --> 17:51.606
Aren't you supposed
to be down at the court

17:51.641 --> 17:53.377
observing Jacqueline's case?

17:53.412 --> 17:55.346
Oh, uh, I left a burner
phone under my seat.

17:55.381 --> 17:57.414
Oh.
It's recording the trial
in a transcription app,

17:57.449 --> 17:58.745
and it will text
me if a word

17:58.780 --> 18:00.549
like "interesting,"
"significant,"

18:00.584 --> 18:01.748
or "important" pops up,
which I promise you

18:01.783 --> 18:03.354
will never happen.
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.

18:03.389 --> 18:05.257
You can't even do
the one thing I asked you to do.

18:05.292 --> 18:06.918
I cannot deal
with you right now.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.558
I want you
to clean up this mess and go

18:09.593 --> 18:11.461
to your office.

18:11.496 --> 18:13.727
I don't<i> have</i> an office.

18:13.762 --> 18:18.435
(watch chirping)
All this trash is pretty trashy.

18:19.768 --> 18:22.505
Nothing too weird.

18:22.540 --> 18:24.342
All very gross.

18:24.377 --> 18:26.410
Someone likes grapefruit.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.185
Wait a second.

18:37.918 --> 18:41.293
(line ringing)

18:41.328 --> 18:44.296
WOMAN:
Hello. Hello?

18:44.331 --> 18:46.364
Um...
(click)

18:48.830 --> 18:50.467
(sighs)

18:57.003 --> 19:00.345
Hey, I need login access for all
the municipal search databases.

19:00.380 --> 19:02.677
Right away. I need reverse
phone number directory lookup,

19:02.712 --> 19:03.942
local business guild info...

19:03.977 --> 19:05.746
Because you're
an unlicensed detective,

19:05.781 --> 19:07.352
your searches will have
to be run and approved by me.

19:07.387 --> 19:09.618
Now, fill out these three forms.

19:09.653 --> 19:11.521
What? That's ridiculous.
I work here now.

19:11.556 --> 19:14.425
Look, all I want is
to find out which local business

19:14.460 --> 19:16.658
uses this symbol.

19:16.693 --> 19:17.989
And you think I have access

19:18.024 --> 19:19.727
to some magic database
that can do that?

19:19.762 --> 19:22.565
Uh, yes. Don't you? What's
the point of all this equipment

19:22.600 --> 19:24.666
if you don't have
some incredible machine

19:24.701 --> 19:26.899
that analyzes things
and instantly identifies them?

19:26.934 --> 19:29.242
I wasn't aware I was
starring on<i> CSI: Portland.</i>

19:29.277 --> 19:30.639
Look, this is for the mayor.

19:30.674 --> 19:32.311
And that is my case.

19:32.346 --> 19:33.774
And if you don't have
the appropriate billing code

19:33.809 --> 19:35.380
to log your "work,"
you won't get paid.

19:35.415 --> 19:37.008
Oh, my God! Fine. Okay, fine.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.911
Forget it.
I'll do it my way.
You do that.

19:38.946 --> 19:41.254
I do. I am.

19:41.289 --> 19:42.915
I will.

19:48.362 --> 19:50.956
Okay. r/Portland Answers.

19:50.991 --> 19:52.529
Copy and paste.

19:52.564 --> 19:54.597
(lights whir off)

19:57.030 --> 19:59.503
(sighs)

19:59.538 --> 20:04.508
"What is this?" And... post.

20:05.511 --> 20:07.643
MARGARET:
<i> Do you think</i>
<i> the mayor killed Lexy?</i>

20:07.678 --> 20:09.711
SUSAN:
No.

20:09.746 --> 20:12.582
Not at all.

20:12.617 --> 20:13.979
That campaign
manager, though?

20:14.014 --> 20:15.717
She's intense.

20:15.752 --> 20:17.290
Do you listen to<i> PDX-RAY?</i>

20:17.325 --> 20:20.293
The podcast about
local politics?

20:20.328 --> 20:21.888
They did this whole episode
about her.

20:21.923 --> 20:24.990
She's... kind of notorious.

20:25.025 --> 20:26.827
Notorious? How?

20:26.862 --> 20:28.433
She wanted to be
mayor herself once.

20:28.468 --> 20:30.600
She has motive.

20:30.635 --> 20:33.031
But then she had
some serious problems

20:33.066 --> 20:34.934
with drinking and anger.

20:34.969 --> 20:37.343
She got into this big accident.

20:37.378 --> 20:38.608
She's the one
who crashed her car

20:38.643 --> 20:39.741
into Powell's Books
on New Year's.

20:39.776 --> 20:43.448
Wait. Powell's?
On New Year's Eve?

20:43.483 --> 20:46.616
ALLISON:
<i> Yes. I was working</i>
<i> on New Year's, per my yoozh.</i>

20:46.651 --> 20:49.487
Uh-huh.
And we are the closest
ER to Powell's.

20:49.522 --> 20:51.522
What's her name again?
Moe Simms.

20:51.557 --> 20:53.524
She's the mayor's
campaign manager.

20:53.559 --> 20:55.724
Maureen Simms.

20:55.759 --> 20:58.331
Apparently, there's
a "popcast" about her.

20:58.366 --> 21:01.499
Yes, I know who she is.

21:01.534 --> 21:04.634
And while I cannot
disclose her medical history,

21:04.669 --> 21:08.440
hypothetically, a woman like her
might have been in here

21:08.475 --> 21:10.871
that evening with
a serious head injury.

21:10.906 --> 21:12.510
Which can lead to erratic

21:12.545 --> 21:14.006
or aggressive behavior
down the line.

21:14.041 --> 21:15.810
How erratic?

21:15.845 --> 21:20.045
Could it have caused her to snap
and maybe murder somebody?

21:20.080 --> 21:21.783
Whoa.

21:21.818 --> 21:24.654
Um, that seems like a stretch,
but maybe?

21:24.689 --> 21:26.051
Who do you think
that she might have murdered?

21:26.086 --> 21:28.086
Why aren't you wearing
your wedding ring?

21:28.121 --> 21:30.088
Mom, I'm at work.

21:30.123 --> 21:31.991
I don't want
to lose it inside somebody.

21:32.026 --> 21:33.927
Allison.
It happens.

21:33.962 --> 21:35.566
Why are you wearing
<i> your</i> wedding ring?

21:35.601 --> 21:38.767
Oh. (chuckles)
I don't know. Habit, I guess.

21:39.803 --> 21:41.902
How are we doing
with everything

21:41.937 --> 21:45.103
since that whole situation
took place?

21:45.138 --> 21:46.808
It's been, what, like a week?

21:46.843 --> 21:48.975
I'm fine, I'm fine. I...

21:49.010 --> 21:52.110
I just want to move past it
and, um, get back to work.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.145
Yeah. And then
someone got murdered.
Yes.

21:54.180 --> 21:56.081
Which is why
I'm asking about Moe.

21:56.116 --> 21:57.984
A woman got murdered
who was claiming

21:58.019 --> 21:59.656
to have an affair
with the mayor.

21:59.691 --> 22:00.822
Oh, yeah. She's here.

22:00.857 --> 22:02.087
What do you mean, she's here?

22:02.122 --> 22:03.561
I mean, downstairs.

22:03.596 --> 22:06.091
In the morgue.
Oh.

22:06.126 --> 22:07.499
They brought her in
this morning.

22:07.534 --> 22:08.698
My friend Kelly is the coroner.

22:08.733 --> 22:10.601
Huh.

22:10.636 --> 22:13.505
Well, can you bring
this Kelly up here,

22:13.540 --> 22:15.969
and maybe
I can ask her some questions?

22:17.742 --> 22:20.941
So, Kelly, she was strangled.

22:20.976 --> 22:23.680
And the bruising
on the neck is angled up,

22:23.715 --> 22:25.176
which would suggest...

22:25.211 --> 22:27.816
Uh, killer was short?

22:27.851 --> 22:30.555
Yeah. Well,
shorter than her.
Mm.

22:30.590 --> 22:33.657
Or just... sitting.

22:33.692 --> 22:34.988
Right?
(laughs)
Yeah.

22:35.023 --> 22:37.023
Kind of... reaching up.
Mm-hmm.

22:37.058 --> 22:38.629
(guttural groan)
(laughs)

22:38.664 --> 22:41.764
Thank you. So nice.
Um, well,

22:41.799 --> 22:43.469
thank you very, very much.

22:43.504 --> 22:44.932
Oh, how nice.

22:44.967 --> 22:46.637
You're married.

22:46.672 --> 22:47.902
He leaves his on.

22:49.576 --> 22:52.137
(chuckles): Oh, no.
So, the mayor.

22:52.172 --> 22:54.040
That's exciting.
Moving on up.

22:54.075 --> 22:55.778
Well, it was exciting

22:55.813 --> 22:58.748
until Alistair Song
took the case for himself.

22:58.783 --> 23:00.981
I mean, he doesn't value me.

23:01.016 --> 23:03.654
You know, he
doesn't<i> trust</i> me.

23:03.689 --> 23:06.723
All of my achievements
have simply been ignored.

23:08.089 --> 23:11.596
Maybe you're at
a crossroads

23:11.631 --> 23:14.060
and you just need
to be true to yourself

23:14.095 --> 23:16.128
to come out from under.

23:17.098 --> 23:19.230
(laughs)

23:19.265 --> 23:22.739
You're right.
He can't keep me down.

23:22.774 --> 23:24.202
He's not the boss of me.

23:24.237 --> 23:26.204
Well, I mean, I think
he literally is, but...

23:26.239 --> 23:29.977
What I mean is, I can pursue
this case my own way.

23:30.012 --> 23:32.914
I don't need to sit around
in some second chair

23:32.949 --> 23:35.147
while some man tells me...
Sounds like the mother I know.

23:35.182 --> 23:37.886
Allison. Thank you, honey.
Mm-hmm.

23:37.921 --> 23:39.789
It was so very helpful.

23:39.824 --> 23:42.253
What are you looking at?
The mayor.

23:42.288 --> 23:45.498
...to know that I am cooperating
fully with this investigation.

23:45.533 --> 23:47.665
I had no involvement or...

23:47.700 --> 23:51.163
or knowledge of this crime,
this... murder.

23:51.198 --> 23:52.736
I am innocent.

23:52.771 --> 23:54.133
But effective immediately,

23:54.168 --> 23:56.201
I will be stepping down
as mayor.

23:56.236 --> 23:57.906
(reporters clamoring)

24:04.145 --> 24:05.881
I just want to....

24:05.916 --> 24:08.213
I need to protect my family.
MARGARET:
Eric.

24:08.248 --> 24:10.886
I know you didn't kill her.

24:10.921 --> 24:13.889
And instead of playing defense,
I suggest we get ahead

24:13.924 --> 24:15.286
of these charges.

24:15.321 --> 24:17.024
You could sign
this affidavit,

24:17.059 --> 24:18.828
stating your exact whereabouts
the night of the murder,

24:18.863 --> 24:21.226
promising to turn over
your phone and your computer

24:21.261 --> 24:24.537
and to cooperate
in every possible way.

24:24.572 --> 24:27.166
You and Elaine.
(pen clicking)

24:28.972 --> 24:31.742
Eric, where is she today?

24:31.777 --> 24:33.810
I don't know.

24:33.845 --> 24:37.550
Just, um, she's been so panicked

24:37.585 --> 24:40.014
and acting so strange
since the murder.

24:40.049 --> 24:43.853
Last night she...
she said we should divorce.

24:43.888 --> 24:47.626
I don't... want to lose her.

24:49.223 --> 24:51.223
But I don't know
what's going on.

24:51.258 --> 24:53.764
She took Ryan
to my parents'.

24:53.799 --> 24:56.030
Said she wants
to be alone,

24:56.065 --> 24:58.065
somewhere quiet.

24:58.100 --> 25:00.870
Somewhere private.

25:00.905 --> 25:04.137
She said she needs to think,
be alone...

25:04.172 --> 25:06.810
And relax.

25:08.011 --> 25:10.308
You're welcome.
Thank you.

25:14.347 --> 25:16.688
Hello.

25:16.723 --> 25:19.086
Thank you.
Here you are.

25:21.662 --> 25:23.695
BOTH:
What are you doing here?

25:23.730 --> 25:25.928
I am looking
for the mayor's missing wife,

25:25.963 --> 25:27.798
and you are supposed
to be in court.

25:27.833 --> 25:30.669
Mom, they're only on doll 34.
Nothing is happening.

25:30.704 --> 25:32.935
What makes you think
the mayor's wife is here?

25:32.970 --> 25:34.266
Elaine knows something
about Lexy's murder.

25:34.301 --> 25:35.806
She's processing.

25:35.841 --> 25:37.742
She's mentioned this place
to me many times.

25:37.777 --> 25:39.304
She adores the spa here.

25:39.339 --> 25:41.240
She finds it
relaxing and calming.

25:41.275 --> 25:42.912
And it is.

25:42.947 --> 25:45.684
But the bird poop facials
are a complete scam.

25:45.719 --> 25:47.719
Oh, okay, I'll cancel
my appointments immediately.

25:47.754 --> 25:49.248
But why did Lexy have
a valet stub

25:49.283 --> 25:52.823
from this place in her trash,
which obviously is her trash

25:52.858 --> 25:54.990
if you're here, too,
so, ha, I was right.

25:55.025 --> 25:56.695
But maybe
she knew Elaine?

25:56.730 --> 26:00.292
Hello. Please put
your first name and a scent

26:00.327 --> 26:01.964
you connect with.

26:01.999 --> 26:05.198
Vanilla? Okay, so,
do we go in separate

26:05.233 --> 26:06.771
or storm in together, or...?

26:06.806 --> 26:09.070
Todd, this a women's-only
establishment.

26:09.105 --> 26:11.974
And I do not care
to be embarrassed. Again.

26:12.009 --> 26:14.339
Thank you.

26:20.215 --> 26:24.052
The mayor's wife<i> is</i> here,
so her car must be.

26:44.470 --> 26:45.975
Elaine. Hello.
(gasps)

26:46.010 --> 26:48.912
Oh, Margaret.

26:48.947 --> 26:50.375
You frightened me.

26:50.410 --> 26:51.981
I'm so sorry.

26:52.016 --> 26:54.687
I knew I'd find you here.

26:54.722 --> 26:57.789
This must be such a strange
and confusing time.

26:57.824 --> 27:00.088
Perhaps a quiet day
of reflection is exactly...

27:00.123 --> 27:01.859
No. No, I...

27:01.894 --> 27:05.390
No, I'm... I'm here
because I feel safer in public.

27:21.408 --> 27:23.375
(line ringing)

27:23.410 --> 27:26.917
(phone and line ringing)

27:41.032 --> 27:43.032
(alarm chirps)

27:43.067 --> 27:45.100
(phone ringing)

27:49.502 --> 27:52.811
Well, hello, cheap,
untraceable burner phone.

27:59.017 --> 28:01.116
I told Eric

28:01.151 --> 28:03.756
I'll do whatever it takes
to salvage his career.

28:03.791 --> 28:05.758
I'll go away,

28:05.793 --> 28:06.957
I'll...

28:06.992 --> 28:08.519
I'll go to jail.

28:08.554 --> 28:10.796
Elaine,
what are you talking about?

28:10.831 --> 28:12.259
What happened?

28:12.294 --> 28:14.096
I, uh...

28:15.396 --> 28:17.033
I did something...

28:18.531 --> 28:20.399
...very bad.

28:34.822 --> 28:36.514
Did you ever...?
Excuse me. I, um...

28:36.549 --> 28:39.055
I need to use the ladies'.
I'll... I'll be right back.

28:44.194 --> 28:46.931
Oh, Margaret?
The, um,

28:46.966 --> 28:49.527
Valet Captain General needs
to speak to you?

28:49.562 --> 28:51.837
Immediately.

28:56.602 --> 28:59.141
Mom! Get in! It's me. Get in.

28:59.176 --> 29:01.143
Todd, I am working.

29:01.178 --> 29:04.982
Elaine is acting very stra...
Whose car is this?

29:05.017 --> 29:07.149
It's her car.
This is about Elaine.

29:07.184 --> 29:09.250
I am in the middle
of something, Todd.

29:09.285 --> 29:11.549
(horn tooting)
No!
Mom,

29:11.584 --> 29:12.825
get in this car!

29:18.063 --> 29:20.162
We are taking this car
to the police right now.

29:20.197 --> 29:21.834
Look, it's filled with evidence.

29:21.869 --> 29:25.299
Money, burner phone,
and the GPS shows she went

29:25.334 --> 29:27.466
to Lexy's house the night of
the murder. Maybe to kill her?

29:27.501 --> 29:30.843
No, no, no.
Maybe to talk her out of it,

29:30.878 --> 29:32.471
to convince her not to do it.

29:32.506 --> 29:34.473
(engine starts)
Wait. No, Todd.

29:34.508 --> 29:37.542
You are not adding grand theft
auto to your criminal record.

29:37.577 --> 29:40.116
It's not grand theft auto if
you're driving it to the police.

29:40.151 --> 29:41.579
Oh, no, Todd.
Abso... No, Todd! No!

29:41.614 --> 29:43.218
What are you doing?
Get off the wheel.

29:43.253 --> 29:44.615
I'm driving this car.

29:44.650 --> 29:46.991
Stop! Yeah, let-let's
crash a stolen car.

29:47.026 --> 29:48.322
That's a great idea.
Oh. If we're gonna crash,

29:48.357 --> 29:49.895
I'm gonna put
my seat belt on right now.

29:49.930 --> 29:51.457
Please put
your seat belt on.

29:51.492 --> 29:54.229
J-Just put your foot on the
brake and stop the car. Okay...

29:54.264 --> 29:56.099
Yeah.
Wait. Elaine.

29:57.905 --> 29:59.432
Where-where...
where is she going?

30:01.073 --> 30:02.468
(stammers)
(phone ringing)

30:02.503 --> 30:04.305
Oh, my God.
I don't have my phone on me.

30:04.340 --> 30:05.636
Is it the burning?
It's the burning.
But it's not me.

30:05.671 --> 30:07.308
It's not the burning.
No, it's, uh...

30:07.343 --> 30:09.409
Wait.
It's her phone.

30:09.444 --> 30:10.883
Huh?
Yes, it must be in her purse.

30:10.918 --> 30:12.280
And the Bluetooth
from the car

30:12.315 --> 30:13.919
is picking up the call. Uh...
Oh, God.

30:13.954 --> 30:14.986
No, don't answer it.
Yes, yes, yes.

30:15.021 --> 30:16.020
No, we shouldn't answer...
No.

30:16.055 --> 30:17.417
(high-pitched voice):
Hello?

30:17.452 --> 30:19.056
MAN:
Hello? Elaine, is that you?

30:20.059 --> 30:22.026
(high-pitched muttering)

30:22.061 --> 30:24.897
We must have a bad connection.
You sound all garbled.

30:24.932 --> 30:27.592
I told you something bad would
happen if you stopped paying me.

30:27.627 --> 30:29.902
Now Lexy's dead,
and it looks pretty bad

30:29.937 --> 30:32.135
for you and the mayor, and if
you don't want it to get worse,

30:32.170 --> 30:34.566
you bring that cash
to the old ice rink

30:34.601 --> 30:36.942
on Johnson today at 6:00 p.m.

30:36.977 --> 30:39.010
We don't want our little secret
slipping out, do we?

30:39.045 --> 30:40.671
(click)

30:40.706 --> 30:43.278
Oh, no.

30:43.313 --> 30:44.917
I don't like this at all.
Where's she going?

30:44.952 --> 30:46.281
She's gonna walk
into traffic, Mom.
Pull over.

30:46.316 --> 30:48.382
Pull over. She's desperate.
We have to stop her.

30:48.417 --> 30:51.682
Elaine? Elaine? No!

30:51.717 --> 30:53.453
No!

30:53.488 --> 30:55.059
No, no!
(horn honking)

30:55.094 --> 30:56.522
Stop.

30:56.557 --> 30:58.656
Just put me in jail.

30:58.691 --> 31:00.933
I did it. I killed her.

31:00.968 --> 31:03.694
Oh, Elaine.
Put me away, please.

31:03.729 --> 31:06.433
I'll-I'll be safe there.

31:15.477 --> 31:18.577
(pigeon cooing)

31:18.612 --> 31:21.019
(watch chirps)
5:58.

31:21.054 --> 31:22.581
The old ice rink on Johnson.

31:22.616 --> 31:25.155
Just received
a free bird poop facial.

31:25.190 --> 31:28.290
As promised, underwhelming.

31:28.325 --> 31:30.490
Am now waiting
for some goon to arrive

31:30.525 --> 31:34.626
and... kill me?
Great day all...

31:38.401 --> 31:40.005
(phone camera clicking)

31:40.040 --> 31:41.600
(clatters)

31:48.741 --> 31:51.082
Whoa.
(coos)

31:53.284 --> 31:55.053
(panting)

31:56.089 --> 31:57.583
(grunts)
(engine starts)

31:59.422 --> 32:01.455
(phone camera clicking)

32:03.195 --> 32:04.524
(sighs)

32:06.660 --> 32:09.001
It's a license plate.

32:09.036 --> 32:12.202
6-D-2. I-I think there's
a "B" in there somewhere.

32:12.237 --> 32:14.699
On a moped Vespa thing,
and I don't care

32:14.734 --> 32:17.042
what the billing codes are.
I need to know who owns this.

32:17.077 --> 32:18.538
Oh, you don't care?

32:18.573 --> 32:21.046
Must be nice.
You don't have to care.

32:21.081 --> 32:23.114
You make a mistake,
someone else cleans it up.

32:23.149 --> 32:25.116
If I made a mistake,
I'd get fired.

32:25.151 --> 32:26.777
Oh, come on!
Can't you just

32:26.812 --> 32:30.121
plug it into one
of your little databases? Wait.

32:30.156 --> 32:33.487
What is this?
Is this the mayor?

32:35.458 --> 32:37.062
This is my case,

32:37.097 --> 32:38.492
and until you fill out
the proper paperwork,

32:38.527 --> 32:40.527
I don't want to see you
in here again.

32:40.562 --> 32:42.562
I'm not breaking rules for you.

32:42.597 --> 32:45.202
My mommy isn't here
to protect me.

32:50.770 --> 32:52.605
(scoffs)

32:53.575 --> 32:55.278
(Clem crying)

32:56.080 --> 32:58.512
Do you think your niece
will ever stop crying?

32:58.547 --> 33:00.085
She has the lungs
of an opera singer.

33:00.120 --> 33:01.416
Mm.
It's wild.

33:01.451 --> 33:02.615
Does she needs this?

33:02.650 --> 33:04.386
Oh, no, thank you.

33:04.421 --> 33:06.124
I put Clementine to sleep
in your bed. I hope that's okay.

33:06.159 --> 33:07.653
Yes, of course.

33:07.688 --> 33:09.523
She can spend the night here
if you want. You both can.

33:09.558 --> 33:11.492
No. No, thanks.
Lawrence will be home

33:11.527 --> 33:13.527
early tomorrow, and
he'll want to see her.

33:13.562 --> 33:15.397
MARGARET:
And I would like
to see him.

33:15.432 --> 33:17.498
That's why she's crying.
She misses her daddy.

33:17.533 --> 33:19.137
(indistinct chatter)

33:19.172 --> 33:21.469
(phone chimes)

33:21.504 --> 33:23.702
Come on. Okay.

33:24.705 --> 33:26.408
"Lyle.

33:26.443 --> 33:31.215
"Lyle, dear,
I know Todd can be impossible,

33:31.250 --> 33:34.251
"but someday you'll understand
that he's a genius.

33:34.286 --> 33:37.386
"Please assist him with this
license plate situation and

33:37.421 --> 33:39.520
"bill my code for this case.

33:39.555 --> 33:42.193
"You can text the results
to Todd directly.

33:42.228 --> 33:44.426
"Oh, and you don't need
to report to me

33:44.461 --> 33:46.230
"if he's late for work.

33:46.265 --> 33:47.660
Thank you."

33:47.695 --> 33:50.366
(whooshing)

33:50.401 --> 33:52.533
CHUCK:
<i> Well, uh,</i>

33:52.568 --> 33:54.865
as always, welcome to our home.

33:54.900 --> 33:57.373
I marinated tonight's fish
in cumin and pep...

33:57.408 --> 33:59.540
So she's being arraigned
tomorrow?
Mm-hmm.

33:59.575 --> 34:01.179
And she's pleading guilty
to murder?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

34:01.214 --> 34:03.115
But she didn't do it.

34:03.150 --> 34:05.183
Why would she go to jail
for a crime she didn't commit?

34:05.218 --> 34:07.746
Well, to protect herself
and her family

34:07.781 --> 34:09.319
from some horrible secret.

34:09.354 --> 34:12.289
I mean, look at the life
she's walking away from.

34:12.324 --> 34:14.423
She's the mayor's wife. They
live in the mayor's mansion.

34:14.458 --> 34:16.557
They have that beautiful son.

34:16.592 --> 34:18.361
Well, maybe she's unhappy.
Maybe she wants out.

34:19.197 --> 34:20.792
CHET:
And you're the investigator
working on this case

34:20.827 --> 34:23.432
with the mayor?
Yes. No. Well, not

34:23.467 --> 34:25.533
officially.
I, uh, am apparently one

34:25.568 --> 34:27.139
of the bottom people
at the firm,

34:27.174 --> 34:28.503
not the top.
Todd.

34:28.538 --> 34:30.439
I can't be trusted
with delicate matters.

34:30.474 --> 34:31.836
I would trust you more
if you could follow orders.

34:31.871 --> 34:33.343
Are you following orders?

34:33.378 --> 34:35.279
Did you arrange food
and respect your elders?

34:35.314 --> 34:37.149
Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
No, you didn't.

34:37.184 --> 34:38.909
No, you did not. So it's okay
for you to go rogue and-and

34:38.944 --> 34:40.614
not play by the rules,
but for me it's...
I am your boss.

34:40.649 --> 34:42.319
And he's your boss.
And I gave you that job.

34:42.354 --> 34:43.617
And he gave you a job.
And I am better than that job.

34:43.652 --> 34:45.157
And so am I with mine.

34:45.192 --> 34:47.522
Todd, I have earned my place

34:47.557 --> 34:49.854
at that firm by working hard,
rising to the occasion,

34:49.889 --> 34:53.429
completing the tasks
assigned to me...
Okay.

34:53.464 --> 34:55.398
...and compromising
when necessary.

34:55.433 --> 34:56.828
And even then,
there are roadblocks.

34:56.863 --> 34:59.270
But I work through them.
While you-- you just expect

34:59.305 --> 35:01.404
to leapfrog
to the fantasy life and career

35:01.439 --> 35:02.900
you've always wanted
like that?

35:02.935 --> 35:05.837
You can go rogue
all you want when you have

35:05.872 --> 35:08.246
worked your way up
from the bottom like I did.

35:11.218 --> 35:12.811
Well, uh,

35:12.846 --> 35:15.517
I think if it's all right
with all of you,

35:15.552 --> 35:20.258
I will leapfrog to my lair
and finish my allotted gruel.

35:20.293 --> 35:22.359
Oh, um, it's halibut.

35:22.394 --> 35:25.461
And I will have you know that
my chair at my fantasy career

35:25.496 --> 35:28.596
in my mother's office
is a rolling step stool.

35:29.962 --> 35:32.468
Get some bread.
Yeah.

35:36.441 --> 35:38.540
(sighs)

35:38.575 --> 35:40.608
(phone buzzes)

35:42.942 --> 35:44.942
LYLE:
Oh, good evening, Todd Margaret.

35:44.977 --> 35:46.944
So nice to hear from you-her.

35:46.979 --> 35:48.979
Nice try,
but I'm not searching anything

35:49.014 --> 35:50.981
without an official written
and signed request

35:51.016 --> 35:52.653
from your mother.

35:52.688 --> 35:54.424
Your little Viking
will have to wait.

35:54.459 --> 35:58.230
I will see you tomorrow morning
at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

35:58.265 --> 35:59.924
My little Viking?

36:04.799 --> 36:07.800
Is that the mascot for...?

36:09.903 --> 36:11.870
(school bell ringing)

36:11.905 --> 36:13.905
(indistinct chatter)

36:13.940 --> 36:16.776
(footfalls approaching)

36:16.811 --> 36:19.317
WOMAN:
And here are
a few more yearbooks.

36:19.352 --> 36:21.715
You said class of...?
Uh, I don't really know.

36:21.750 --> 36:23.981
He could've been 40 years old,
could've been 30.

36:24.016 --> 36:25.851
I'm not even sure
he was a student here.

36:25.886 --> 36:28.887
Well, we will just
keep looking. (laughs)

36:28.922 --> 36:31.461
You did you say
you were one of our graduates.

36:31.496 --> 36:34.695
No, I only did summer school
here. I went to Wilson.

36:39.031 --> 36:42.373
Okay, Mr. Moped, where are you?

36:45.708 --> 36:48.808
Wait. He was faculty?

36:50.317 --> 36:51.547
Dragon Romano.

36:51.582 --> 36:54.286
Seriously? Dragon?

36:58.325 --> 37:00.754
That's the mayor's wife.

37:05.662 --> 37:07.596
Wait. How old is...?

37:09.765 --> 37:11.633
No... way.

37:17.674 --> 37:19.872
(phone buzzing)

37:22.514 --> 37:26.417
JUDGE:
Yes, good morning. All right,
I'm taking over today

37:26.452 --> 37:28.518
for Judge Morrison
who's stuck on another trial,

37:28.553 --> 37:30.586
so please bear
with me a moment.

37:40.928 --> 37:43.698
(line ringing)
It's ringing.

37:43.733 --> 37:46.030
Mom, pick up your phone.

37:46.065 --> 37:49.605
Oh, hey there, bud. Sorry.

37:49.640 --> 37:50.969
Floor is locked down.
Mayor's here.

37:51.004 --> 37:52.509
What? It's locked down?
Yup.

37:52.544 --> 37:54.346
No access to this level
next three hours.

37:54.381 --> 37:55.776
No, no, no, but I-I have
to get to that...
No, not unless

37:55.811 --> 37:56.876
you're part of an active trial.

37:56.911 --> 37:58.878
(sighs)

37:58.913 --> 38:00.880
But I am part
of an active trial.

38:00.915 --> 38:03.047
<i> Jacqueline DuBois</i>
<i> v. the Portland Water Bureau.</i>

38:03.082 --> 38:04.950
Wow. Really?
Yes.

38:04.985 --> 38:07.018
I specialize
in water-damaged porcelain dolls

38:07.053 --> 38:09.988
wearing satin recreations
of 1830s ballgowns.

38:10.023 --> 38:13.596
Damn. Well, all the experts
are listed here, and...

38:13.631 --> 38:15.026
Yeah, and I'd better be
at the top of that list.

38:15.061 --> 38:16.566
What-what name do you have?

38:16.601 --> 38:19.800
Um, David Ainsworth?
Worth?

38:19.835 --> 38:21.604
That's me.

38:21.639 --> 38:23.001
Oh, wow. Okay.

38:23.036 --> 38:24.805
Yeah, then follow me.
Sure.

38:24.840 --> 38:26.477
They said no witnesses
for this trial till tomorrow.

38:26.512 --> 38:27.808
Yeah. Well, things have
seriously deteriorated,

38:27.843 --> 38:29.810
and the dolls are just
dropping like flies.

38:29.845 --> 38:32.681
It's that bad?
Oh it's Dollmageddon.

38:32.716 --> 38:34.716
(whispering):
Well, uh, Mr. Ainsworth?

38:39.591 --> 38:41.393
Mr. Ainsworth, that's...
that's the wrong courtroom.

38:41.428 --> 38:42.823
We're over here.

38:48.666 --> 38:51.667
(fire alarm ringing,
gallery clamoring)

38:52.835 --> 38:56.804
Okay. Stay calm.
Everybody out that way.

38:56.839 --> 38:58.608
Mom! Mom!
He's right there!

38:58.643 --> 38:59.675
That's the voice
on the car phone.

38:59.710 --> 39:00.610
He's the guy
who murdered Lexy!

39:00.645 --> 39:03.140
Charley, him! Get him!

39:04.583 --> 39:06.847
(groaning)

39:09.885 --> 39:14.624
I'm Ryan's father!
I'm Ryan's father!

39:14.659 --> 39:16.857
(crying):
I'm sorry.

39:16.892 --> 39:18.859
I'm so sorry.

39:18.894 --> 39:22.929
It's okay. Shh. It's okay.

39:22.964 --> 39:24.832
Okay.

39:24.867 --> 39:26.867
TODD:
<i> The whole thing--</i>

39:26.902 --> 39:29.672
Lexy, the affair, her murder,
was all a setup by Dragon.

39:29.707 --> 39:31.135
MARGARET:
And Elaine

39:31.170 --> 39:33.005
left him
because he was insane.

39:33.040 --> 39:34.842
Then she married
the future mayor,

39:34.877 --> 39:36.580
but she was already pregnant.

39:36.615 --> 39:38.483
TODD:
Dragon is the real father
of the mayor's child,

39:38.518 --> 39:40.584
and Dragon blackmailed Elaine
for years,

39:40.619 --> 39:42.784
but when she stopped paying,
he framed her for Lexy's murder.

39:42.819 --> 39:45.556
MARGARET:
He wanted to destroy her family,

39:45.591 --> 39:48.185
and I'll help put Dragon away
for the rest of his life.

39:48.220 --> 39:52.761
And I understand the mayor
has resumed his campaign

39:52.796 --> 39:56.061
and will stay with us
at the firm.

39:56.096 --> 39:59.570
As<i> my</i> client.

39:59.605 --> 40:02.705
Yes. Of course.

40:06.513 --> 40:09.778
Margaret.
Alistair.

40:09.813 --> 40:12.847
Todd.
Sorry.

40:12.882 --> 40:16.147
So, he can have access
to these three databases.

40:16.182 --> 40:17.951
But?
According to municipal law,

40:17.986 --> 40:19.524
without a registered
P.I. license,

40:19.559 --> 40:20.822
he is not allowed to...

40:20.857 --> 40:22.186
To access the other
eight databases.

40:22.221 --> 40:25.123
All right, I understand.
So, Todd,

40:25.158 --> 40:27.499
you're just going to have
to go through Lyle on occasion.

40:27.534 --> 40:29.127
And we will get you
your employee I.D. number

40:29.162 --> 40:30.535
and the correct billing codes.

40:30.570 --> 40:31.866
Okay, and what
about the chair?

40:31.901 --> 40:33.769
I'll get you a chair.

40:33.804 --> 40:35.639
But if there are
no empty offices...

40:35.674 --> 40:37.201
There are no
empty offices.

40:37.236 --> 40:40.611
Okay, that's it.
Let's get back to work.

40:40.646 --> 40:43.108
Your office is
so incredibly clean.

40:46.245 --> 40:50.115
TODD:
Careful. Careful.

40:50.150 --> 40:51.919
Hot coffee.

40:51.954 --> 40:56.858
And... they got the coffee
out of this.

40:56.893 --> 40:58.662
Wow. You picked up
my dry cleaning?

40:58.697 --> 41:01.027
Yeah, and paid for it. Well,
just paid for this one item.

41:01.062 --> 41:03.161
You had, like,
35 things in there.

41:03.196 --> 41:05.064
Well, I do enjoy a dry clean.

41:05.099 --> 41:07.231
So, wait. Tell me again
what you overheard.

41:07.266 --> 41:08.936
Yeah, it was your mom
and Song in the library.

41:08.971 --> 41:10.135
With the candlestick.
(chuckles)

41:10.170 --> 41:12.709
Sorry. Continue.

41:12.744 --> 41:14.238
Anyway, he was telling her,

41:14.273 --> 41:16.713
you know,
not the right time, soon,

41:16.748 --> 41:19.551
she'll be a named partner
by next year, blah, blah, blah.

41:19.586 --> 41:22.312
Lame.
But he also told her

41:22.347 --> 41:25.282
that you did a really good job
on the mayor's case.

41:25.317 --> 41:27.790
And what did she say?

41:27.825 --> 41:30.056
"I value him highly."

41:30.091 --> 41:31.860
Good.
(laughs softly)

41:32.863 --> 41:35.160
Wait.

41:35.195 --> 41:36.766
This is not my sweater.

41:36.801 --> 41:37.899
It's not?

41:37.934 --> 41:41.166
This is a poncho for...

41:41.201 --> 41:43.641
Suzanne Yard.

41:44.644 --> 41:46.072
Well, it's clean.

41:46.674 --> 41:48.910
("Gotta Get Up"
by Nilsson playing)

41:50.881 --> 41:52.243
Oh, hi.

41:52.278 --> 41:54.817
Oh, look at this
little tough guy.

41:54.852 --> 41:59.151
What's all this fuzz?
Who is this?

41:59.186 --> 42:01.791
Oh. Your mom had me put
a few things in there for you.

42:01.826 --> 42:05.025
