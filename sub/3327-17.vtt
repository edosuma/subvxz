WEBVTT

00:03.530 --> 00:06.241
Both victims work
for ZBZ Security.

00:06.592 --> 00:08.013
Company has a contract

00:08.016 --> 00:12.019
with the Turtle Bay Historical
Society right next door.

00:12.021 --> 00:14.238
Now, nothing's missing
from the museum.

00:14.240 --> 00:15.656
We're canvassing
the area

00:15.658 --> 00:18.525
for the gun, shooter,
any possible witnesses.

00:18.527 --> 00:21.078
So, thoughts?

00:22.313 --> 00:24.615
Holmes?
Thoughts?

00:24.617 --> 00:25.616
Sorry, sorry.

00:25.618 --> 00:27.651
I was waiting
for Miss Watson.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.620
I'm training her to analyze
every environment

00:29.622 --> 00:31.872
with the keen eye
of the true detective.

00:32.957 --> 00:34.425
Watson, thoughts?

00:34.427 --> 00:38.178
Um, um...

00:38.180 --> 00:42.999
Looks like both men have been
shot in the chest one time.

00:43.001 --> 00:46.470
Judging from the scuff marks
on the concrete,

00:46.472 --> 00:48.806
looks like they chased
the suspect up here,

00:48.808 --> 00:52.059
who then fired twice
and then ran.

00:53.778 --> 00:56.563
It's tough to say where he went.

00:56.565 --> 00:59.066
The reason it's difficult
to say where he ran

00:59.068 --> 01:01.151
is that no one ran
anywhere at all.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.321
Here we have
two deceased gentlemen,

01:04.322 --> 01:06.657
both of them wearing
the uniform of ZBZ.

01:06.659 --> 01:08.242
Or so it would appear.

01:08.244 --> 01:11.027
This man's patches were
recently sewn on,

01:11.029 --> 01:12.880
and his clothes are
store-bought,

01:12.882 --> 01:15.165
not made by
a uniform company.

01:15.167 --> 01:17.534
So he was posing as a guard.

01:17.536 --> 01:19.703
Nothing is missing
from the museum,

01:19.705 --> 01:22.756
so we assume that he was looking
for access to the parking lot.

01:22.758 --> 01:24.391
It's easy to rifle
through the cars

01:24.393 --> 01:26.477
if you look like you work
for the security firm.

01:26.479 --> 01:27.978
Now, what was in
his pockets? Pockets?

01:27.980 --> 01:29.980
Pockets.

01:37.572 --> 01:40.190
Yeah, see, you thought
he was a victim,

01:40.192 --> 01:42.109
so you were looking
for identification.

01:42.111 --> 01:44.828
But here we have
one, two, three, four

01:44.830 --> 01:46.229
car registration cards.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.165
Each one has
the owner's address on it.

01:48.167 --> 01:49.733
See the game?

01:49.735 --> 01:52.903
Pick an expensive car,
then you call an associate,

01:52.905 --> 01:55.238
who burgles the home
of its owner while they're out.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.407
This man is
a real security guard.

01:57.409 --> 02:00.377
He saw this fellow
lurking around, followed him.

02:00.379 --> 02:02.012
Bad man shoots good man.

02:02.014 --> 02:03.597
Good man, while still alive,

02:03.599 --> 02:06.633
wrests control of gun
from bad man, fires one shot.

02:06.635 --> 02:08.301
Here we are.

02:08.304 --> 02:09.803
One more thing.

02:09.805 --> 02:11.271
His cell phone.

02:11.273 --> 02:13.724
You're gonna check
the last number he dialed;

02:13.726 --> 02:15.025
that's his partner.

02:15.027 --> 02:17.194
He's probably robbing
a place right now.

02:19.614 --> 02:21.615
Would you like to talk
to the burglar?

02:21.617 --> 02:25.285
According to this,
his name is Loco Maurice.

02:25.287 --> 02:28.989
You mustn't allow your failure
to discourage you.

02:28.991 --> 02:31.992
Didn't fail.
Not discouraged.

02:31.994 --> 02:34.545
You didn't solve the case,
but you did notice

02:34.547 --> 02:36.279
the incongruity
of the scuff marks.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.664
The next step is learning

02:37.666 --> 02:39.883
to extrapolate your way
to the truth.

02:39.885 --> 02:41.668
Detection is not just
a skill, Watson.

02:41.670 --> 02:43.253
It's a point of view.

02:43.255 --> 02:44.922
You must train yourself
to be alert

02:44.924 --> 02:46.423
to the bizarre,
the unusual,

02:46.425 --> 02:50.177
that which has no place
in any given picture.

02:50.179 --> 02:51.512
Like that stretch limo

02:51.514 --> 02:53.514
with the driver staring
straight at us?

02:53.516 --> 02:54.565
Sherlock Holmes?

02:54.567 --> 02:56.299
My name's Crabtree.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.852
We got your name from
a Mr. Musgrave in London.

02:58.854 --> 03:01.271
Local police told us
we'd find you here.

03:01.273 --> 03:03.323
Oh. You say "we."

03:03.325 --> 03:05.141
All I see is a you.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.194
I'm a driver and attaché

03:07.196 --> 03:09.079
for Mr. Gerald Lydon
of Lydon Industries.

03:09.081 --> 03:10.664
You know the company?

03:10.666 --> 03:12.032
You make everything
from Scotch Tape

03:12.034 --> 03:13.667
to diamond-tipped drill bits.

03:13.669 --> 03:16.286
Well, we have all the tape
and drill bits that we need.

03:16.288 --> 03:17.621
Thank you very much.

03:17.623 --> 03:19.706
Mr. Lydon has a proposal
for you.

03:23.261 --> 03:26.129
I sit before you a lucid man.

03:26.131 --> 03:28.098
Vital, I might say.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.851
I hold 18 patents

03:30.853 --> 03:33.670
and I can do 11 pull-ups
at age 58.

03:33.672 --> 03:36.557
And I own exactly
16 forks.

03:36.559 --> 03:38.174
I'm not entirely sure

03:38.176 --> 03:40.027
what we're supposed
to be comparing.

03:40.029 --> 03:44.314
Well, the point, Mr. Holmes,
is that in my good moments,

03:44.316 --> 03:46.400
I'm every bit
the man I was.

03:46.402 --> 03:48.652
But there are fewer
and fewer of those

03:48.654 --> 03:50.037
because I have dementia.

03:50.039 --> 03:51.822
And it's getting worse,

03:51.824 --> 03:55.025
which is why Ms. Tompkins
is following me around.

03:55.027 --> 03:56.877
You have my
condolences.

03:56.879 --> 03:59.079
I don't want your condolences.

03:59.081 --> 04:01.164
I want your help.

04:01.166 --> 04:03.033
Have you ever heard

04:03.035 --> 04:05.869
of hereditary cerebral
amyloid angiopathy?

04:05.871 --> 04:07.804
Hereditary CAA.

04:07.806 --> 04:09.840
It's a genetic disorder.

04:09.842 --> 04:12.342
Less than 20,000
cases recorded.

04:12.344 --> 04:13.894
Dementia is one

04:13.896 --> 04:15.312
of the early symptoms.

04:15.314 --> 04:16.930
And death is the final symptom.

04:16.932 --> 04:20.317
And when it comes to me,
it will complete my murder,

04:20.319 --> 04:24.054
because somebody did this to me,
and I need you to find out who.

04:24.056 --> 04:27.357
So, it's a hereditary disorder.

04:27.359 --> 04:29.526
You have to be born with it.

04:29.528 --> 04:32.613
And there's no history
of it in my family.

04:32.615 --> 04:35.282
They can do a lot of things
in labs now, you know.

04:35.284 --> 04:37.417
And I've consulted with
some of the top geneticists,

04:37.419 --> 04:39.119
and they tell me
that it's possible

04:39.121 --> 04:41.088
that somebody gave me
this disease,

04:41.090 --> 04:42.756
because they want me
out of power!

04:42.758 --> 04:45.125
With all due respect,

04:45.127 --> 04:47.577
maybe these
geneticists are right.

04:47.579 --> 04:50.797
"Possible" does
not mean "likely".

04:50.799 --> 04:53.750
It just means it's
not impossible.

04:53.752 --> 04:56.753
That's what my family says,
that's what the police say,

04:56.755 --> 04:59.556
that I'm paranoid,
that I'm delusional.

04:59.558 --> 05:02.258
I hate to say this, but those
are also symptoms of CAA.

05:02.260 --> 05:05.612
Look, they tell me
that you're the best.

05:05.614 --> 05:08.949
Mr. Holmes, what will it cost
to buy you over to my side?

05:08.951 --> 05:13.153
I only take cases when I believe
I'm acting in good faith.

05:13.155 --> 05:16.623
Now, since I think that
naturally occurring dementia

05:16.625 --> 05:19.626
is by far and away
the most likely explanation

05:19.628 --> 05:23.497
for your plight,
I would not be doing that.

05:23.499 --> 05:26.783
Would you pull over,
please, Crabtree?

05:26.785 --> 05:28.284
I really am
truly sorry.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.887
And I wish you
the best of luck.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:56.197 --> 05:58.081
I read the last
stack of books.

05:58.083 --> 06:00.367
No questions... asked.

06:00.369 --> 06:04.371
But, uh, Jeremy Bentham is
a utilitarian philosopher.

06:04.373 --> 06:06.540
That has nothing to do
with being a detective.

06:06.542 --> 06:08.992
Bentham is the father
of modern criminology.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.828
He said that crime is
the result of free will.

06:13.132 --> 06:14.965
Uh, you're gonna put
the acid away

06:14.967 --> 06:16.833
before we answer the door,
right?

06:21.689 --> 06:24.141
Delivery for you,
Mr. Holmes.

06:24.143 --> 06:26.977
Thank you, Crabtree,
but I'm afraid I...

06:26.979 --> 06:28.645
Oh, my God.

06:28.647 --> 06:30.180
Is that...?

06:30.182 --> 06:32.282
A bee in a box?
Yes, it is.

06:32.284 --> 06:34.868
Fairly unimpressive
as far as bribes go.

06:34.870 --> 06:38.405
Not if you're
an apiculturist.

06:38.407 --> 06:42.743
That's an osmia avoseta--
solitary bee

06:42.745 --> 06:45.862
famed for building exquisite
nests from flower petals.

06:47.665 --> 06:50.200
It's on the verge
of extinction.

06:50.202 --> 06:53.369
Crabtree, this is exquisite.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.721
I cannot accept it.

06:54.723 --> 06:57.557
Please tell Mr. Lydon
not to contact me again.

06:57.559 --> 07:00.010
I told him you are a man
of convictions.

07:00.012 --> 07:02.596
Perhaps now
he'll believe me.

07:14.325 --> 07:16.743
This is ridiculous.
Single stick is <i>your</i> hobby.

07:16.745 --> 07:18.561
It's not gonna help me
solve crimes.

07:19.998 --> 07:21.782
Aim for the pate.

07:21.784 --> 07:23.399
Good morning, Captain.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.869
Are you in bed with
a guy named Gerald Lydon?

07:25.871 --> 07:27.504
He tried to hire me.
I declined.

07:27.506 --> 07:29.089
Well, that's not what he thinks.

07:29.091 --> 07:31.258
You should get down here.
He's asking for you.

07:31.260 --> 07:32.709
Why?

07:32.711 --> 07:35.545
I don't know,
but we just arrested him.

07:35.547 --> 07:39.132
He shot his driver--
guy named Crabtree.

07:39.134 --> 07:42.035
He's being charged with murder.

07:53.993 --> 07:55.993
His nurse witnessed
the whole thing, though.

07:55.995 --> 07:58.196
There was some kind
of episode...

07:58.198 --> 07:59.747
Yeah, well, I've
been patient. Excuse me.

07:59.749 --> 08:01.332
I want to see my father!

08:01.334 --> 08:03.150
No-- Hey, that's not
gonna happen, okay?

08:03.152 --> 08:05.036
Your dad killed somebody.
This is a crime scene.

08:05.038 --> 08:06.938
You guys got
to step back.

08:06.940 --> 08:08.289
My father is sick.

08:08.291 --> 08:10.374
Lydon's sons.

08:10.376 --> 08:12.093
They're hands-on.

08:12.095 --> 08:14.762
Anyway, he's asking
for you.

08:14.764 --> 08:17.098
Says you're the only one
he'll see.

08:17.100 --> 08:20.268
Crabtree worked
for me for 23 years.

08:20.270 --> 08:23.354
I know his partner; I helped
them adopt their daughter.

08:23.356 --> 08:26.974
I don't know how I could
think that he would hurt me.

08:29.978 --> 08:33.147
I'm-I'm having a hard time
holding on

08:33.149 --> 08:37.017
to what's real
and what isn't.

08:37.019 --> 08:39.537
Uh, this-this conviction

08:39.539 --> 08:43.323
that someone did this to me...

08:45.544 --> 08:48.396
...I don't know
where it comes from.

08:48.398 --> 08:53.134
And maybe it is a delusion,
but everything in my life

08:53.136 --> 08:56.003
feels so slippery,
except for that.

08:56.005 --> 08:57.839
That feels solid.

08:59.808 --> 09:02.209
Help me!

09:12.271 --> 09:15.356
Hey, why do you have the box
with the bee in it?

09:15.358 --> 09:16.891
We took Gerald
Lydon's case.

09:16.893 --> 09:18.242
We did?

09:18.244 --> 09:20.111
Well, frankly, I
couldn't say no to him.

09:20.113 --> 09:23.531
It would have felt like denying
a dying man his last wish.

09:23.533 --> 09:25.249
We are taking
this home,

09:25.251 --> 09:27.568
and then we're going
to the genetics lab

09:27.570 --> 09:29.837
which confirmed
his diagnosis.

09:32.624 --> 09:35.927
At Watt Helix, we always say our
work isn't just about genetics.

09:35.929 --> 09:39.130
It's about healthier food.
It's about a longer life.

09:39.132 --> 09:40.948
It's about you.

09:40.950 --> 09:42.550
Utter pabulum.

09:42.552 --> 09:44.135
You'd think corporate science
would maintain

09:44.137 --> 09:46.604
some vestige of dignity.

09:46.606 --> 09:47.939
His portrait
was painted

09:47.941 --> 09:49.724
by Kirian Boyd;
that's impressive.

09:49.726 --> 09:53.561
This place is
a tower of ego.

09:53.563 --> 09:55.530
So, you're Sherlock Holmes?

09:55.532 --> 09:56.480
Hi.

09:56.482 --> 09:58.265
And Joan
Watson, right?

09:58.267 --> 09:59.734
Yes. Hi.

09:59.736 --> 10:01.619
I'm Raph Keating;
I'm president here.

10:01.621 --> 10:03.103
This is Natasha
Kademan.

10:03.105 --> 10:04.605
She heads up the
medical research team.

10:04.607 --> 10:07.575
'Tash, meet Holmes
and... Watson.

10:07.577 --> 10:09.911
Hi.
Natasha Kademan. I know that name.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.128
You wrote your dissertation

10:11.130 --> 10:12.830
on "The Warrior Gene,"
did you not?

10:12.832 --> 10:15.049
Ms. Kademan conducted
a study which many say

10:15.051 --> 10:17.218
isolated the gene responsible
for sociopathic behavior.

10:17.220 --> 10:19.170
Sterling work.

10:19.172 --> 10:20.555
And why are you

10:20.557 --> 10:21.839
plowing these fields?

10:21.841 --> 10:23.624
My funding dried up.

10:23.626 --> 10:27.261
The receptionist said you have
a question about Gerald Lydon.

10:27.263 --> 10:31.399
Lydon thinks
someone gave him CAA?

10:31.401 --> 10:33.184
Did you know
about this?

10:33.186 --> 10:36.437
Sure. He used to talk
about it when he came in.

10:36.439 --> 10:38.990
It sounded...
delusional.

10:38.992 --> 10:40.608
And it may well be.

10:40.610 --> 10:42.810
But Mr. Lydon insists
that geneticists,

10:42.812 --> 10:45.279
whose names escape
him at the moment,

10:45.281 --> 10:47.949
assure him that it is
technically possible.

10:47.951 --> 10:49.500
You diagnosed
his condition,

10:49.502 --> 10:51.535
your lab has researched
the disease extensively.

10:51.537 --> 10:53.037
Is it?

10:53.039 --> 10:56.591
I guess if you had
unlimited money, a great lab,

10:56.593 --> 10:58.259
you probably could do it.

10:58.261 --> 11:01.512
The CAA comes from a mutation
of the APP gene.

11:01.514 --> 11:03.431
There may be seven people
out there

11:03.433 --> 11:06.500
that might be able
to crack it.

11:06.502 --> 11:08.469
Could I have their names
and addresses, please?

11:08.471 --> 11:09.470
Seriously?

11:09.472 --> 11:11.606
Mm-hmm.

11:28.123 --> 11:29.857
Hey, what's this?

11:29.859 --> 11:31.459
You're a detective
now; you tell me.

11:31.461 --> 11:32.860
Uh, it looks like

11:32.862 --> 11:34.655
you left your dry cleaning
ticket for me.

11:34.680 --> 11:35.497
Yes.

11:35.498 --> 11:37.748
The reason being...
as well as being colleagues,

11:37.750 --> 11:40.751
we are now embarking on a quite
unusual domestic partnership,

11:40.753 --> 11:44.422
so we should aggregate our
errands, not duplicate them.

11:44.424 --> 11:47.258
So, I get the dry cleaning
and you get what?

11:47.260 --> 11:50.344
I shall clean our refrigerator
once monthly. Agreeable?

11:50.346 --> 11:52.063
You should pick that up early.

11:52.065 --> 11:53.681
We're leaving
for Norway tomorrow.

11:53.683 --> 11:54.982
What?

11:54.984 --> 11:56.150
I've been delving into

11:56.152 --> 11:57.985
our "magnificent seven"
geneticists,

11:57.987 --> 11:59.737
and I have discovered
a connection

11:59.739 --> 12:01.689
which merits further
exploration.

12:01.691 --> 12:04.275
This is Dr.
Ingvald Moller.

12:04.277 --> 12:05.943
He runs a lab in Oslo,

12:05.945 --> 12:07.895
which specializes in the study

12:07.897 --> 12:10.865
of rare genetic
disorders.

12:10.867 --> 12:12.750
He looks very...

12:12.752 --> 12:15.286
Scandinavian.
He does.

12:15.288 --> 12:18.456
Now, his lab is affiliated
with the National University,

12:18.458 --> 12:21.542
which means it's publically
funded, and yet Dr. Moller

12:21.544 --> 12:24.378
recently put a down payment on
a home on the Geiranger Fjord,

12:24.380 --> 12:26.847
which was once owned by
the Norwegian royal family.

12:26.849 --> 12:28.382
Lovely place.

12:28.384 --> 12:30.584
Well outside what a public
servant could afford.

12:30.586 --> 12:34.388
And interestingly,
his loan papers were cosigned

12:34.390 --> 12:38.025
by one Carter Lydon.

12:38.027 --> 12:41.395
Okay, so you think that Carter
paid this guy to figure out

12:41.397 --> 12:43.614
how to give his father CAA.
Interesting.

12:43.616 --> 12:45.316
But why do we have
to go to Norway?

12:45.318 --> 12:46.650
Carter Lydon lives
right here.

12:46.652 --> 12:48.536
I would rather question
a scientist

12:48.538 --> 12:50.321
than a businessman.

12:50.323 --> 12:52.656
And Norway has fjords
and glaciers,

12:52.658 --> 12:55.109
and women reared on a diet
of wild-caught salmon.

12:55.111 --> 12:56.077
Oh, that explains it.

12:57.246 --> 13:00.214
Looks like a molecule.

13:05.620 --> 13:07.922
"The thing itself"--
that's a weird way to put it.

13:07.924 --> 13:09.340
The warrior gene.

13:09.342 --> 13:13.260
The warrior gene--
where's the dissertation?

13:18.800 --> 13:20.101
This is Natasha Kademan's

13:20.103 --> 13:23.303
monograph.

13:23.305 --> 13:26.857
I seem to remember
something in the conclusion.

13:30.979 --> 13:33.748
"When it comes to understanding
sociopathic behavior,

13:33.750 --> 13:35.816
"understanding the warrior
gene is paramount.

13:35.818 --> 13:37.818
It is the
thing itself."

13:37.820 --> 13:39.920
So Natasha sent this.

13:39.922 --> 13:42.489
She knows
what's going on.

13:48.713 --> 13:50.330
Now she's panicking.

13:50.332 --> 13:52.716
Now she's trying to
figure out her next move.

13:52.718 --> 13:55.603
And if she's as smart
as she seems to be,

13:55.605 --> 13:58.505
now she's realizing we
are her best option.

14:12.654 --> 14:14.822
Ms. Kademan?

14:16.875 --> 14:19.076
Hello?

14:37.549 --> 14:39.730
We found electrician's tape
covering the lock

14:39.733 --> 14:41.233
on one of the back doors.

14:41.235 --> 14:43.285
It looks like someone slipped in
to commit a burglary,

14:43.287 --> 14:44.753
found Ms. Kademan
working late.

14:44.755 --> 14:46.655
What were they trying
to burgle, blood samples?

14:46.657 --> 14:48.439
No, I think not.

14:48.441 --> 14:50.208
Ms. Kademan's murder
was connected

14:50.210 --> 14:52.861
to the Gerald Lydon case.

14:52.863 --> 14:55.080
The Gerald Lydon
case is closed.

14:55.082 --> 14:57.299
I'm not talking about
the murder of his chauffeur.

14:57.301 --> 14:59.668
I am talking about
the investigation into who gave

14:59.670 --> 15:02.087
the man a substance
which induced his CAA.

15:02.089 --> 15:04.756
Our most promising
suspect at the moment

15:04.758 --> 15:06.925
is Lydon's son, Carter.

15:06.927 --> 15:09.794
CAA is inherited; you can't
just give it to somebody.

15:09.796 --> 15:11.462
Ms. Kademan thought
it was possible.

15:11.464 --> 15:13.732
In fact, she thought
that's exactly what happened.

15:13.734 --> 15:15.066
You believe her?

15:15.068 --> 15:16.568
She made someone
nervous enough

15:16.570 --> 15:18.570
to stab her
half a dozen times.

15:18.572 --> 15:21.724
I'm inclined
to explore further.

15:21.726 --> 15:24.143
this was no robbery.

15:24.145 --> 15:26.262
That portrait...

15:26.264 --> 15:29.065
was done by
Kirian Boyd.

15:29.067 --> 15:31.517
It is by far the most
valuable object in here.

15:31.519 --> 15:33.736
Oh, but it was
until it was stained

15:33.738 --> 15:36.272
with several drops
of the killer's blood.

15:36.274 --> 15:38.390
The victim's blood is
all over the place.

15:38.392 --> 15:40.493
What makes you think that
came from the killer?

15:40.495 --> 15:42.328
Excellent question.

15:42.330 --> 15:43.496
Watson.

15:44.998 --> 15:47.566
Uh, um...

15:49.536 --> 15:51.070
Well,

15:51.072 --> 15:54.590
the spatters on the floor
indicate that she was

15:54.592 --> 15:56.742
facing away from the portrait
when she was stabbed.

15:56.744 --> 15:59.578
Um, all of her wounds are
on her anterior side,

15:59.580 --> 16:03.049
so it's tough to see how her
blood ended up on the portrait.

16:03.051 --> 16:05.468
Um, now if she tried
to fight back, then...

16:05.470 --> 16:08.420
Then it's easy to see how
a blow to the killer's face

16:08.422 --> 16:10.389
might result in
those stains.

16:10.391 --> 16:11.641
Kudos, Watson.

16:11.643 --> 16:12.809
Adequately done.

16:12.811 --> 16:15.528
Oh, my God.

16:15.530 --> 16:17.029
'Tash.

16:17.031 --> 16:18.147
Who's that?

16:18.149 --> 16:19.365
Victim's fiancé.

16:19.367 --> 16:21.267
Came down for the I.D.

16:21.269 --> 16:24.120
I knew that she was working
with a dementia patient

16:24.122 --> 16:27.273
named Gerald Lydon,
but 'Tash never told me

16:27.275 --> 16:30.960
that she thought
somebody dosed him.

16:30.962 --> 16:33.029
I'm-I'm a geneticist, too,
so I'm pretty sure

16:33.031 --> 16:35.014
she would've said something.

16:36.334 --> 16:38.351
Honestly, I thought
you were gonna ask me

16:38.353 --> 16:39.585
about that guy Benny.

16:39.587 --> 16:41.220
Benny?

16:41.222 --> 16:43.923
Cordaro?

16:43.925 --> 16:46.642
Cordero?

16:46.644 --> 16:49.128
He was in prison
for stabbing someone

16:49.130 --> 16:52.298
when 'Tash was doing
her warrior gene research.

16:52.300 --> 16:55.268
He claimed that she used his
blood without permission.

16:55.270 --> 16:58.988
He came down here, like, a
month ago to scream at her.

16:58.990 --> 17:01.357
Well, we'll look into it.

17:13.819 --> 17:17.455
Oh, I haven't seen those
since organic chem.

17:17.458 --> 17:18.958
Natasha thought you could
induce CAA.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.626
You think that's how you do it?

17:20.627 --> 17:23.212
Certainly seems possible.

17:23.214 --> 17:25.464
But this--
Oh, don't touch.

17:25.465 --> 17:28.550
Obviously, this is
a rendering of a molecule,

17:28.553 --> 17:31.437
but the elements aren't labeled,
so I can't tell which molecule.

17:31.439 --> 17:33.606
Until I do,
I can't say for certain.

17:33.608 --> 17:35.474
Well, she did give you a list
of the best geneticists

17:35.476 --> 17:37.560
in the world; have you thought
about asking one of them?

17:37.562 --> 17:39.812
You mean our pool of suspects?

17:39.814 --> 17:43.032
Hmm. If I haven't decoded
this thing by morning,

17:43.034 --> 17:46.152
we'll send it to someone
unconnected with the case.

18:06.423 --> 18:09.141
I worked hard on that dinosaur.

18:11.896 --> 18:14.146
I spent some time with that
picture Natasha sent last night.

18:14.148 --> 18:16.349
I figured out most of
the elements, and then the rest

18:16.351 --> 18:18.150
I sent on to my old
genetics professor.

18:18.152 --> 18:19.569
In the middle of the night?

18:19.571 --> 18:21.103
Well, he has insomnia,
so he's always up

18:21.105 --> 18:22.605
between 2:00 and 4:00 anyway.

18:22.607 --> 18:24.991
You were romantically involved

18:24.993 --> 18:26.692
with your genetics instructor.

18:26.694 --> 18:27.994
Jerry was amazed by this.

18:27.996 --> 18:29.245
He said it was like

18:29.247 --> 18:30.496
looking at
something out of

18:30.498 --> 18:32.198
Leonardo da Vinci's sketchbook.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.699
It's a man-made chemical

18:33.701 --> 18:35.785
from the polycyclic
hydrocarbon family.

18:37.421 --> 18:39.005
It's like we thought.

18:39.007 --> 18:40.423
This is a mutagen

18:40.425 --> 18:42.241
that targets the
stretch of the genome

18:42.243 --> 18:46.379
that is responsible
for hereditary CAA.

18:46.381 --> 18:48.130
That's quite beautiful.

18:48.132 --> 18:49.181
So,

18:49.183 --> 18:50.766
all we have to do now is prove

18:50.768 --> 18:52.635
that someone paid a genius
to develop this

18:52.637 --> 18:54.420
and then used it
on Gerald Lydon.

18:54.422 --> 18:57.607
That should be
a fascinating day's work.

18:57.609 --> 18:59.725
It's cold.
Did you pick up my sweaters?

18:59.727 --> 19:01.093
Seriously?

19:01.095 --> 19:02.778
I will thank you
for the molecular formula

19:02.780 --> 19:05.731
when I'm sufficiently warm
to do so.

19:19.129 --> 19:21.914
Hi.

19:30.724 --> 19:33.843
She say, "Wait one second,
almost commercial."

19:53.830 --> 19:55.998
She say she never
seen you before.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.617
Uh, I'm here
for a friend.

19:58.619 --> 20:00.536
Wow, that's
quite a coat.

20:00.538 --> 20:02.755
It's warm.

20:11.515 --> 20:14.050
Um, don't you want money?

20:19.407 --> 20:21.891
She says $75.

20:21.893 --> 20:24.176
For four sweaters?

20:24.178 --> 20:26.312
Okay, $19 then.

20:36.156 --> 20:38.157
Um, could I get a receipt?

20:38.159 --> 20:39.408
No.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.583
<i>So, Benny, you're saying</i>

20:47.585 --> 20:49.402
<i>you were mad at Ms. Kademan.</i>

20:49.404 --> 20:51.670
Hell yeah, I
was mad at her.

20:51.672 --> 20:53.589
I signed up for her study
to get brownie points

20:53.591 --> 20:54.924
with the parole board.

20:54.926 --> 20:57.259
She called me
an incurable sociopath.

20:57.261 --> 20:59.211
You think that didn't
add time to my sentence?

20:59.213 --> 21:01.547
So you went to Ms. Kademan's
office a few weeks ago

21:01.549 --> 21:04.066
to threaten her, and last
night you killed her.

21:04.068 --> 21:05.317
No.

21:05.319 --> 21:08.270
You don't have an alibi.

21:08.272 --> 21:10.573
Yeah, but it wasn't like that.

21:10.575 --> 21:13.025
What's with Main
Moon Dry Cleaning?

21:13.027 --> 21:16.695
I'll admit the new management
is not much for efficiency,

21:16.697 --> 21:18.330
but I find them charming.

21:18.332 --> 21:20.750
That's Benjamin Cordero.

21:20.752 --> 21:23.369
Career blackmailer,
general blackguard.

21:23.371 --> 21:26.005
Also innocent of the murder
of Natasha Kademan,

21:26.007 --> 21:28.591
which I would very much like
to get back to solving.

21:28.593 --> 21:31.093
We don't need your DNA, genius.

21:31.095 --> 21:32.795
You're a convicted felon.

21:32.797 --> 21:34.263
We got a sample on file.

21:46.059 --> 21:49.145
Which means you got
a very short window

21:49.147 --> 21:50.813
to cooperate with us.

21:58.955 --> 22:00.956
So, you want to make
a statement?

22:02.160 --> 22:04.877
You delay,
but time will not!

22:09.082 --> 22:10.332
That's a quote--

22:10.334 --> 22:12.618
Benjamin Franklin.
I know who said it.

22:12.620 --> 22:14.804
I just don't know why you're
shouting it through the mirror!

22:14.806 --> 22:16.672
This crime has
a certain elegance to it.

22:16.674 --> 22:19.458
It involves careful planning,
scientific innovation,

22:19.460 --> 22:21.227
a country home in
the Norwegian fjords.

22:21.229 --> 22:23.229
That prosaic individual
has no place in it.

22:23.231 --> 22:24.963
He had beef with
Natasha Kademan.

22:24.965 --> 22:26.465
He's been to jail
for a stabbing.

22:26.467 --> 22:28.150
Okay by you if
we run his DNA?

22:28.152 --> 22:31.136
It's not my place
to tell you your job.

22:31.138 --> 22:33.656
But by the time
you get your results back,

22:33.658 --> 22:36.325
I will be that much closer
to proving that someone,

22:36.327 --> 22:38.527
most probably Carter Lydon
working in concert

22:38.529 --> 22:40.312
with a Norwegian geneticist,

22:40.314 --> 22:43.148
poisoned Gerald Lydon with
a hitherto nonexistent compound

22:43.150 --> 22:44.500
and then murdered
Natasha Kademan

22:44.502 --> 22:46.452
when she found out
what they were up to.

22:46.454 --> 22:47.670
Oh, I take it back.

22:47.672 --> 22:50.873
Your version sounds
much more plausible.

22:50.875 --> 22:52.758
Sorry, you think
there's actually something

22:52.760 --> 22:54.210
to my dad's story?

22:54.212 --> 22:55.761
We do.

22:55.763 --> 22:58.264
And we think that elements
within the company

22:58.266 --> 23:00.316
may be responsible.

23:00.318 --> 23:01.967
Elements?
What elements?

23:01.969 --> 23:03.235
I'd rather not say.

23:03.237 --> 23:04.670
What I would like

23:04.672 --> 23:06.522
is root access
to your company's servers.

23:06.524 --> 23:09.191
We may be able to build a case
by tracking e-mails.

23:09.193 --> 23:12.561
Uh, I mean, I don't know
if I can do that, guys.

23:12.563 --> 23:14.530
I mean, there are big
changes coming here.

23:14.532 --> 23:16.515
I don't even know what job
I'm gonna have next week.

23:16.517 --> 23:18.484
Your job?
We're talking about your father.

23:18.486 --> 23:19.702
My father doesn't

23:19.704 --> 23:21.453
need your help.

23:21.455 --> 23:23.205
That's for him
to determine.

23:23.207 --> 23:25.023
Thanks for your text.
Mm-hmm.

23:25.025 --> 23:27.209
And actually,
it's not my dad's decision.

23:27.211 --> 23:29.545
He was declared legally
incompetent this morning.

23:29.547 --> 23:31.997
Your services are
no longer needed.

23:31.999 --> 23:33.666
Get out.

23:33.668 --> 23:35.417
Actually, our contract
with your father calls

23:35.419 --> 23:38.203
for termination in writing,
countersigned by both parties.

23:43.226 --> 23:44.927
Sign here.

23:44.929 --> 23:47.513
<i>It worked.</i>

23:47.515 --> 23:48.931
The thing with
the termination letter.

23:48.933 --> 23:50.482
I mean, obviously
we don't even have

23:50.484 --> 23:51.901
a contract with Gerald Lydon,

23:51.903 --> 23:54.386
but I noticed that Carter
bites his nails.

23:54.388 --> 23:56.054
People who bite
their nails tend

23:56.056 --> 23:57.523
to chew writing
implements as well.

23:57.525 --> 23:59.575
Well, he never
asked for it back.

23:59.577 --> 24:02.077
You know,
maybe we can get a DNA sample.

24:02.079 --> 24:04.647
If he killed Natasha,
then we've got him.

24:04.649 --> 24:06.615
I just need a plastic bag.

24:06.617 --> 24:09.335
Not a bad gambit, Watson, though
a hair sample would be better.

24:09.337 --> 24:10.786
A hair sample?

24:10.788 --> 24:12.288
What do you want from me?

24:12.290 --> 24:13.956
Nothing. I have
a sample already.

24:13.958 --> 24:17.576
Carter, like many people
who slick their hair back,

24:17.578 --> 24:20.245
carries a comb, so I
picked his pockets.

24:20.247 --> 24:22.381
If you want to
be a detective,

24:22.383 --> 24:25.301
you should get in the habit
of carrying evidence bags.

24:30.725 --> 24:32.591
Detective Bell.

24:32.593 --> 24:35.594
We may well have
cracked the case.

24:35.596 --> 24:38.030
Benny Cordero's DNA
came back a match

24:38.032 --> 24:39.565
for the blood at the scene.

24:39.567 --> 24:41.233
I hate to burst your bubble,

24:41.235 --> 24:44.320
but we're booking him
for murder.

24:51.803 --> 24:54.738
That's not my blood.
No way, no how.

24:54.739 --> 24:56.072
It's not even possible.

24:56.074 --> 24:58.207
Look, we test 13 different
genetic markers.

24:58.209 --> 25:00.659
Every single one of them
was a perfect match.

25:00.661 --> 25:02.028
Then somebody set me up.

25:02.030 --> 25:04.046
Look, I know
this looks bad.

25:04.048 --> 25:06.482
Doesn't look like anything.

25:06.484 --> 25:07.867
We know what happened.

25:07.869 --> 25:09.719
It's over.

25:09.721 --> 25:13.389
W-What if I did have
an alibi?

25:15.342 --> 25:17.876
I live
in this courtyard building,

25:17.878 --> 25:19.562
and the couple across the way,

25:19.564 --> 25:21.097
they don't close
their blinds that much.

25:21.099 --> 25:22.381
I notice stuff

25:22.383 --> 25:25.017
with the husband
and the nanny.

25:25.019 --> 25:28.938
Just holding hands first,
then some kissing.

25:28.940 --> 25:31.723
So the night
the Kademan lady got killed,

25:31.725 --> 25:34.744
I got my camera out,
I put the zoom lens on.

25:34.746 --> 25:36.662
So you're saying your alibi

25:36.664 --> 25:39.365
is that you were home,
taking blackmail shots

25:39.367 --> 25:40.899
of one of your neighbors?

25:40.901 --> 25:43.452
Well... yeah.

25:48.575 --> 25:51.460
Are these the same sweaters
I picked up yesterday?

25:51.462 --> 25:53.912
You're a detective
now; you tell me.

25:53.914 --> 25:56.415
Yes, same sweaters.

25:56.417 --> 25:58.300
You left them outside my room
by accident?

25:58.302 --> 25:59.685
I was setting
up to practice

25:59.687 --> 26:00.970
my calligraphy
at the same time

26:00.972 --> 26:02.271
I was unpacking
the dry cleaning.

26:02.273 --> 26:03.939
There was a mishap.

26:03.941 --> 26:06.058
We agreed that you were in
charge of the dry cleaning,

26:06.060 --> 26:08.611
but we didn't say how
often you'd have to go.

26:08.613 --> 26:09.928
Fine, well,
I'm picking another place.

26:09.930 --> 26:11.313
When they're
your clothes,

26:11.315 --> 26:12.898
you're free to go
wherever you like.

26:12.900 --> 26:14.483
My clothes have to
go to Main Moon.

26:14.485 --> 26:16.101
I'm sensitive to the
chemicals in dry cleaning,

26:16.103 --> 26:17.536
and they use only the
gentlest emollients.

26:17.538 --> 26:18.871
Really?
Yes.

26:18.873 --> 26:21.123
Now, as much as I
love dry cleaning,

26:21.125 --> 26:23.275
I'm trying to get
some thinking done.

26:23.277 --> 26:26.412
Oh, so you still think Benny
Cordero didn't kill Natasha?

26:26.414 --> 26:29.081
Never mind the fact that
no one plans a blackmail

26:29.083 --> 26:31.050
and commits murder
on the same evening,

26:31.052 --> 26:32.951
the man has no connection
to the Lydons,

26:32.953 --> 26:34.336
and his supposed victim

26:34.338 --> 26:37.006
texted us the formula
for inducing CAA

26:37.008 --> 26:39.124
and got stabbed
20 minutes later.

26:39.126 --> 26:40.976
Can't be a coincidence.

26:40.978 --> 26:44.480
I'm trying to think of
alternative explanations.

26:44.482 --> 26:45.731
Possibility one

26:45.733 --> 26:48.267
is obvious,
which is why Mr. Cordero

26:48.269 --> 26:49.768
put it forth himself.

26:49.770 --> 26:51.103
Someone got ahold
of his blood

26:51.105 --> 26:52.822
and then planted it
at the crime scene.

26:52.824 --> 26:54.106
Not unheard of,

26:54.108 --> 26:56.108
but also an
investigative dead end.

26:56.110 --> 26:58.977
I can't prove that
it didn't happen.

26:58.979 --> 27:00.863
I get absolutely nowhere
looking into it.

27:00.865 --> 27:03.616
There's no evidence that anyone
other than Benny Cordero

27:03.618 --> 27:05.317
was at Watt Helix
that night,

27:05.319 --> 27:08.087
which is why I'm considering
possibility two.

27:08.089 --> 27:10.589
It's blank.

27:10.591 --> 27:13.509
Possibility two has stubbornly
refused to reveal itself.

27:13.511 --> 27:15.994
Well, keep staring
at the wall.

27:15.996 --> 27:18.631
I'm sure it's hiding
in there somewhere.

27:26.674 --> 27:28.257
Hi again.

27:28.259 --> 27:31.393
Little accident
with the sweaters.

27:34.698 --> 27:36.181
Slow day yesterday?

27:44.574 --> 27:46.408
She say, "Why you ask that?"

27:46.410 --> 27:50.829
So she understands English,
she just doesn't speak it?

27:52.048 --> 27:54.466
I'm only asking because, uh,

27:54.468 --> 27:56.535
that mink coat is
in the same exact place

27:56.537 --> 27:57.887
it was yesterday,
so that means

27:57.889 --> 28:00.506
that hasn't been turned on
since I left.

28:09.816 --> 28:12.234
She say, "Slow day yesterday."

28:12.236 --> 28:15.854
Do dry cleaners
get robbed a lot?

28:17.073 --> 28:18.490
I just noticed that you have

28:18.492 --> 28:20.058
six very expensive
security cameras here

28:20.060 --> 28:22.745
and then two more
at the front door.

28:22.747 --> 28:24.196
Seems like a lot.

28:24.198 --> 28:26.064
They came when we buy place.

28:26.066 --> 28:27.182
Problem?

28:27.184 --> 28:28.567
No, that's not...

28:28.569 --> 28:31.086
That's not a problem.

28:31.088 --> 28:34.072
Thanks.

28:36.577 --> 28:38.427
I figured it out.

28:38.429 --> 28:39.712
I-I'm sorry to interrupt,

28:39.714 --> 28:42.097
um, but I know exactly
what you were up to.

28:42.099 --> 28:43.299
I sincerely doubt that.

28:43.301 --> 28:44.916
Would you excuse us
for a moment?

28:44.918 --> 28:46.852
There is a reason why you keep
sending me to Main Moon.

28:46.854 --> 28:48.637
They don't do any business,
they don't even know

28:48.639 --> 28:50.773
how much to charge, and they
have a load of security cameras.

28:50.775 --> 28:52.057
There's definitely
something going on.

28:52.059 --> 28:53.392
Watson, I admire
your enthusiasm.

28:53.394 --> 28:55.110
I have no idea
what you're on about.

28:55.112 --> 28:56.762
You wanted me to notice.

28:56.764 --> 28:58.597
I wanted my sweaters.

28:58.599 --> 29:01.150
Now, I know I have counseled you
to be alert,

29:01.152 --> 29:03.268
but that doesn't mean that
there is a conspiracy lurking

29:03.270 --> 29:04.536
behind every door.

29:04.538 --> 29:06.655
Okay, so what are
you up to then?

29:06.657 --> 29:09.941
After you went to bed,
I spent a good hour

29:09.943 --> 29:11.577
trying to reckon
how an innocent man's blood

29:11.579 --> 29:13.579
could wind up at the scene
of a murder

29:13.581 --> 29:15.164
if it wasn't planted there.

29:15.166 --> 29:17.967
Then I remembered
something that you said.

29:17.969 --> 29:19.635
The late Mrs. Kademan
gave us a list

29:19.637 --> 29:21.920
of the top geneticists
in the world.

29:21.922 --> 29:23.789
Why not ask them?

29:23.791 --> 29:26.091
Everyone, say hello
to Miss Watson.

29:26.093 --> 29:27.309
Hi.

29:27.311 --> 29:29.178
Good morning.

29:29.180 --> 29:31.563
I left Dr. Moller from Norway
off the list.

29:31.565 --> 29:34.066
Now, the others were
a bit confused at first,

29:34.068 --> 29:36.301
but after I posed
the problem to them,

29:36.303 --> 29:38.604
we had quite
a lively discussion, didn't we?

29:38.606 --> 29:39.938
Yes.

29:39.940 --> 29:43.359
Turns out,
there is another possibility.

29:43.361 --> 29:45.944
Jurgi, would you please explain
your breakthrough

29:45.946 --> 29:47.529
to Miss Watson?

29:47.531 --> 29:51.083
It's quite simple, really,
though I should give you

29:51.085 --> 29:53.118
a grounding
in cellular biology.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.821
Another time perhaps, Jurgi.
Actually, you know what,

29:55.823 --> 29:57.656
I'll call you all back.
Thank you.

29:57.658 --> 29:59.541
He's a brilliant man,
little bit long-winded.

29:59.543 --> 30:03.829
Gist of it is: law enforcement
runs a standard DNA test

30:03.831 --> 30:05.097
called STR analysis.

30:05.099 --> 30:07.549
It's actually a
bit imprecise.

30:07.551 --> 30:09.835
It tests 13 loci
against each other,

30:09.837 --> 30:12.521
when there are
countless possibilities.

30:12.523 --> 30:15.274
All assembled agree
that technology has advanced

30:15.276 --> 30:17.643
to the point
where you could manufacture

30:17.645 --> 30:20.446
a match of 13 loci.

30:20.448 --> 30:22.865
So you're saying you can fake
a DNA sample?

30:22.867 --> 30:25.034
All you would need is access
to a top-tier lab

30:25.036 --> 30:27.119
and access
to someone's genetic code.

30:27.121 --> 30:29.705
And I'm not just saying
that you could do it,

30:29.707 --> 30:32.107
I just regathered my
round table to tell them

30:32.109 --> 30:34.460
that in this case,
someone did do it.

30:34.462 --> 30:36.628
How could you
possibly know that?

30:36.630 --> 30:39.364
I called in a favor

30:39.366 --> 30:42.000
from the medical examiner's
DNA lab.

30:42.002 --> 30:44.035
They provided a sample
of the blood found

30:44.037 --> 30:45.704
at the scene of Natasha
Kademan's murder

30:45.706 --> 30:47.389
for a full workup.

30:47.391 --> 30:49.892
A friend of Jurgi's at
Columbia handled the analysis.

30:49.894 --> 30:52.978
All 13 loci tested
in STR analysis

30:52.980 --> 30:55.514
were a perfect match
for Benny Cordero,

30:55.516 --> 30:59.184
but there were no other
loci at all in the sample.

31:01.053 --> 31:03.906
So you're saying someone
stripped a blood sample

31:03.908 --> 31:05.190
of its genetic material

31:05.192 --> 31:06.859
and then created a match
for the loci

31:06.861 --> 31:08.444
they knew the police
would check?

31:08.446 --> 31:11.864
Only a geneticist would be able
to carry that out.

31:11.866 --> 31:14.733
It seems like everyone connected
to this case is a geneticist.

31:14.735 --> 31:17.068
But only one pointed us
in the direction

31:17.070 --> 31:20.038
of Benny Cordero
in the first place.

31:20.040 --> 31:22.574
So, this
morning, my consultant

31:22.576 --> 31:25.043
marches into my office
and says the damndest thing.

31:25.045 --> 31:29.715
He thinks it's possible
to manufacture a DNA sample.

31:29.717 --> 31:33.135
Thing is, he
was right.

31:33.137 --> 31:35.604
The blood that we found

31:35.606 --> 31:38.256
at the scene
of your fiancée's murder,

31:38.258 --> 31:41.393
it didn't belong
to Benny Cordero.

31:41.395 --> 31:44.146
It was just designed
to look that way.

31:44.148 --> 31:47.699
Well, that sounds kind of crazy.

31:47.701 --> 31:50.619
Now, you work for
Ubient Pharmaceuticals, right?

31:50.621 --> 31:52.704
I bet they have nice labs.

31:52.706 --> 31:54.206
What are you saying?

31:54.208 --> 31:55.574
Paul, come on.

31:55.576 --> 31:57.876
We know the sample was faked.

31:57.878 --> 32:02.113
We know you pointed us at Benny
Cordero in the first place.

32:02.115 --> 32:05.918
We know you had access to his
genetic makeup via your fiancée.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.452
We know your employer

32:07.454 --> 32:10.389
has probably the top
lab in the city.

32:10.391 --> 32:11.924
We also have a
pretty good idea

32:11.926 --> 32:14.259
of the equipment you'd
need to manufacture

32:14.261 --> 32:15.894
a fake DNA sample.

32:15.896 --> 32:18.230
Now, we can get a court
order to look at it,

32:18.232 --> 32:20.315
but as it turns out,
we don't need to.

32:20.317 --> 32:22.634
We shared everything
we know with your bosses.

32:22.636 --> 32:24.486
They gave us access.

32:24.488 --> 32:29.140
Our crime scene unit is
processing the lab as we speak.

32:29.142 --> 32:30.759
You may think you've
covered your tracks,

32:30.761 --> 32:33.812
but if you made the sample
there, we' find it.

32:38.885 --> 32:41.286
Why did you murder your fiancée?

32:50.014 --> 32:52.347
Right after we got engaged,

32:52.349 --> 32:55.517
'Tash and I had complete
genetic workups done.

32:55.519 --> 32:59.271
Natasha asked them to check
us both for the warrior gene,

32:59.273 --> 33:02.841
the gene that she isolated
in her research--

33:02.843 --> 33:06.778
just being thorough.

33:06.780 --> 33:10.699
Turns out, I have it.

33:10.701 --> 33:14.203
My DNA says I'm a sociopath.

33:14.205 --> 33:17.489
She said it wouldn't
change anything, but...

33:17.491 --> 33:20.325
I could feel her pulling away.

33:20.327 --> 33:23.212
Then the late-night
phone calls started,

33:23.214 --> 33:24.830
the long hours at work.

33:24.832 --> 33:27.382
She was moving on.

33:27.384 --> 33:29.501
Moving on and stepping out.

33:29.503 --> 33:31.503
You think she was
cheating on you?

33:31.505 --> 33:33.171
A guy knows.

33:33.173 --> 33:34.840
And I even had a name.

33:34.842 --> 33:37.208
Lincoln Dunwoody.

33:39.562 --> 33:41.396
I knew that she was planning
to leave,

33:41.398 --> 33:43.682
and she doesn't get
to make that call.

33:43.684 --> 33:46.985
So you're saying you
murdered her out of jealousy?

33:46.987 --> 33:52.024
I guess I knew for a while
that it was gonna end like this.

33:52.026 --> 33:54.059
That's why I made the blood.

33:54.061 --> 33:55.494
But last Tuesday,

33:55.496 --> 33:58.697
she called to cancel
our dinner date

33:58.699 --> 34:01.033
on my birthday.

34:02.835 --> 34:04.953
That was it.

34:04.955 --> 34:06.722
So where does
Carter Lydon fit in?

34:06.724 --> 34:09.007
The formula for inducing
hereditary CAA?

34:09.009 --> 34:11.710
I don't know what
you're talking about.

34:11.712 --> 34:14.846
I'm talking about the plan
to poison Gerald Lydon.

34:14.848 --> 34:17.349
Look, I killed 'Tash.

34:17.351 --> 34:19.384
Okay? I am telling you that.

34:19.386 --> 34:22.771
But I don't know
how to induce CAA.

34:22.773 --> 34:26.058
I don't even remember
what it stands for.

34:38.404 --> 34:39.955
Hey.

34:39.956 --> 34:42.440
I caught most of the Reeves
stuff from the bullpen,

34:42.442 --> 34:44.743
then Bell filled me in
on the rest.

34:45.962 --> 34:48.163
Look, I know you thought
it was all connected

34:48.165 --> 34:51.783
and that finding Natasha's
killer was gonna help explain

34:51.784 --> 34:53.217
what happened to
Gerald Lydon,

34:53.219 --> 34:55.253
but it didn't work
out that way.

34:55.255 --> 34:57.923
But we do have a
murderer in custody,

34:57.925 --> 35:00.291
and you got around
a fake DNA sample.

35:00.293 --> 35:02.728
Strange name.

35:02.730 --> 35:05.597
Did you know there's no one
called Lincoln Dunwoody

35:05.599 --> 35:07.099
in the whole of New York?

35:07.101 --> 35:09.484
At first, I thought
Natasha Kademan's

35:09.486 --> 35:12.270
paramour was using
a fake name for their affair.

35:12.272 --> 35:13.655
But...

35:15.408 --> 35:17.576
...when you separate
the two names,

35:17.578 --> 35:20.412
treat them as two surnames
rather than

35:20.414 --> 35:24.282
one nonexistent person, you get
a very interesting result.

35:25.535 --> 35:27.419
This Lincoln family

35:27.421 --> 35:29.621
has a long history
of generous philanthropy.

35:29.623 --> 35:33.959
So, too, does
this Dunwoody family.

35:33.961 --> 35:36.878
The Lincoln family's
patriarch is James Lincoln.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.130
He recently retired

35:38.132 --> 35:41.166
after a sudden
and unexpected diagnosis

35:41.168 --> 35:45.137
of cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

35:45.139 --> 35:47.723
There's no history of
the disease in his family.

35:47.725 --> 35:49.358
Hmm.

35:49.360 --> 35:51.109
That is weird.

35:51.111 --> 35:53.979
I don't think Natasha Kademan
was having an affair at all.

35:53.981 --> 35:56.732
I think she was trying to expose
a plot to poison these men.

35:56.734 --> 35:59.785
Well, you only know
of two cases, right?

35:59.787 --> 36:01.620
I mean, CAA is
incredibly rare,

36:01.622 --> 36:03.855
but that could be
just a coincidence.

36:03.857 --> 36:06.491
What if there was
a third person stricken?

36:06.493 --> 36:08.326
Is there?

36:08.328 --> 36:10.045
I don't know.

36:10.047 --> 36:13.465
But I do know that
a woman called Greta Dunwoody

36:13.467 --> 36:17.335
recently retired as president
of her family's foundation.

36:17.337 --> 36:18.837
She's dropped off
the society pages,

36:18.839 --> 36:20.922
and no one is quite sure
what's happened to her.

36:20.924 --> 36:23.141
Well, we need
to find her.

36:23.143 --> 36:25.560
Apparently, the family's
keeping shtum.

36:25.562 --> 36:27.846
But read the list of grants.

36:30.099 --> 36:34.569
Well, they just donated $20
million to St. Bede's Hospital.

36:34.571 --> 36:36.405
If she was sick, I would say

36:36.407 --> 36:39.057
that would be a good place
to start looking.

36:53.706 --> 36:55.874
Ms. Dunwoody?

36:57.628 --> 37:00.512
They told us
we'd find you in here.

37:00.514 --> 37:02.580
Um... these are for you.

37:02.582 --> 37:05.600
They're beautiful.

37:05.602 --> 37:07.602
Thank you.

37:08.521 --> 37:10.722
You're not my son, are you?

37:10.724 --> 37:12.107
No, we...

37:12.109 --> 37:14.559
we just thought we'd
check in on you.

37:14.561 --> 37:16.728
Oh, that's nice.

37:17.596 --> 37:20.098
Do you mind if I practice?

37:20.100 --> 37:24.786
I have to keep practicing
if I want to get into Juilliard.

37:28.608 --> 37:30.575
Amazing.

37:30.577 --> 37:33.662
The brain decays, but
muscle memory remains.

37:35.114 --> 37:37.699
Gerald Lydon wasn't
the only target.

37:37.701 --> 37:39.918
Someone's poisoning
these people.

37:49.404 --> 37:51.438
You're cleaning
the fridge out now?

37:52.440 --> 37:54.123
It's my half of our agreement.

37:54.125 --> 37:56.609
Well, I was hoping
you could help me figure out

37:56.611 --> 37:58.077
who's giving
rich people CAA.

37:58.079 --> 38:00.213
Yes, that was
first on my list.

38:00.215 --> 38:02.164
Now the refrigerator.

38:02.166 --> 38:05.134
You have a suspect. Who?

38:06.169 --> 38:08.037
You're a detective;
you tell me.

38:08.039 --> 38:09.906
Fine.

38:09.908 --> 38:11.140
Uh...

38:11.142 --> 38:12.592
Okay, it's not Carter Lydon.

38:12.594 --> 38:15.094
I mean, he has a motive
to want his father sick,

38:15.096 --> 38:17.930
but he has no reason
to attack strangers.

38:17.932 --> 38:21.234
Maybe he cosigned that loan
for that guy in Norway

38:21.236 --> 38:22.768
because he wanted him

38:22.770 --> 38:24.153
to help with
his father's case.

38:24.155 --> 38:26.188
So who does have
motive to attack

38:26.190 --> 38:28.658
three seemingly
unconnected strangers?

38:28.660 --> 38:30.910
The victims are
three rich people.

38:30.912 --> 38:32.945
They all have
charitable foundations.

38:32.947 --> 38:34.780
The only people
that would benefit

38:34.782 --> 38:37.450
from wealthy philanthropists
coming down with CAA

38:37.452 --> 38:41.087
are the people raising money
to study the disease.

38:41.089 --> 38:44.123
Induce CAA in some of
New York's wealthiest,

38:44.125 --> 38:47.293
then sit back and wait
for donations to flow in.

38:47.295 --> 38:48.844
Not all the victims
would contribute,

38:48.846 --> 38:50.880
so you'd have
to dose more than one.

38:50.882 --> 38:52.932
Did you know
the Lincoln Foundation

38:52.934 --> 38:54.183
gave a rather generous grant

38:54.185 --> 38:56.469
to the research labs
at Watt Helix?

38:56.471 --> 38:58.170
Natasha's company.

38:59.439 --> 39:01.774
She was a whistle-blower.

39:01.776 --> 39:03.359
There's got to be,
what, 50 people

39:03.361 --> 39:04.727
working in research there?

39:04.729 --> 39:06.779
But how many of them
are capable of inventing

39:06.781 --> 39:10.650
an entirely new molecule
which attacks a specific gene?

39:10.652 --> 39:12.818
Well, it's got to be
the smartest person there.

39:12.820 --> 39:14.620
Of course,

39:14.622 --> 39:19.375
that person might not still
work there on a daily basis.

39:23.664 --> 39:25.331
<i>Mr. Watt,</i>

39:25.333 --> 39:27.967
did you know that before
Ms. Kademan was killed,

39:27.969 --> 39:30.586
she was working to
expose a scandal?

39:30.588 --> 39:32.638
It's quite a story.

39:32.640 --> 39:34.540
She thought that
someone at Watt Helix

39:34.542 --> 39:36.976
was inducing mutations
in wealthy people

39:36.978 --> 39:40.563
to attract funding
for research into CAA.

39:42.048 --> 39:44.266
We think she was right.

39:44.268 --> 39:46.819
That's... shocking.

39:46.821 --> 39:48.387
I assume
you have evidence.

39:48.389 --> 39:52.391
Whoever developed
the molecule was brilliant.

39:52.393 --> 39:54.393
A towering intellect.

39:54.395 --> 39:56.245
Someone a lot like you.

39:56.247 --> 39:58.581
I hope that's not
an accusation.

39:58.583 --> 40:00.750
Brian Watt is
a decorated physician.

40:00.752 --> 40:02.568
He has a sterling
reputation.

40:02.570 --> 40:05.571
Why would he risk that for...
whatever you're describing?

40:05.573 --> 40:07.906
We spent a good deal of time

40:07.908 --> 40:11.594
puzzling over that ourselves,
didn't we? Yeah.

40:11.596 --> 40:13.629
We came up with a theory,
but we couldn't be

40:13.631 --> 40:15.881
sure of it until we got
a good look at you.

40:15.883 --> 40:18.751
You have hereditary CAA,
don't you, Mr. Watt?

40:18.753 --> 40:20.219
That's why you're semi-retired,
and that's why

40:20.221 --> 40:22.104
you haven't said a word
since you came in.

40:22.106 --> 40:24.306
We know it's in your family.

40:24.308 --> 40:26.942
Probably why you got into
genetics in the first place,

40:26.944 --> 40:28.927
find a way around
the death sentence

40:28.929 --> 40:30.563
that you carry in your DNA.

40:30.565 --> 40:32.565
But you got sick.

40:32.567 --> 40:34.600
Research wasn't
going fast enough.

40:34.602 --> 40:36.369
So in your more lucid moments,

40:36.371 --> 40:38.537
you hatch a plan to attract
bigger and bigger money.

40:38.539 --> 40:40.373
All you'd
have to do

40:40.375 --> 40:42.742
is to introduce the chemical
you developed

40:42.744 --> 40:45.378
into someone's I.V.

40:45.380 --> 40:48.381
All the victims had procedures
at Stuyvesant Memorial,

40:48.383 --> 40:50.916
a hospital where you still
hold privileges.

40:53.804 --> 40:55.805
You're wrong.

40:55.807 --> 40:57.590
Well, then, you won't mind

40:57.592 --> 40:59.308
if we take a look
inside your home, will you?

40:59.310 --> 41:02.461
'Cause there won't be
any more of the chemical

41:02.463 --> 41:04.096
needed for
further attacks.

41:04.098 --> 41:06.832
We have team of detectives
heading to his home

41:06.834 --> 41:08.367
as we speak.

41:08.369 --> 41:09.902
<i>A stunning arrest today,</i>

41:09.904 --> 41:12.037
as entrepreneur Dr. Brian Watt

41:12.039 --> 41:15.274
has been charged in a bizarre
string of poisonings...

41:15.276 --> 41:17.109
Hi there.
Are my sweaters ready?

41:17.111 --> 41:19.612
I didn't think so.

41:19.614 --> 41:22.114
This is Detective Bell
from the NYPD.

41:22.116 --> 41:24.283
I told him about
the world's worst dry cleaner's,

41:24.285 --> 41:25.484
and he got curious.

41:25.486 --> 41:26.819
Do you know who bought

41:26.821 --> 41:28.337
this place from
the Korean couple

41:28.339 --> 41:30.506
who used to own it?
It's a shell company.

41:30.508 --> 41:32.124
I can't even pronounce it,

41:32.126 --> 41:34.794
but my friends at the NYPD
know all about it.

41:34.796 --> 41:36.429
They think it's
linked to smuggling,

41:36.431 --> 41:38.514
human trafficking...
other fun stuff.

41:38.516 --> 41:40.933
So now I know why you're
so terrible at dry cleaning.

41:40.935 --> 41:43.052
Because the only thing
your owners want you to clean

41:43.054 --> 41:44.770
is their money.

41:44.772 --> 41:47.556
And given all the security
cameras you have in here,

41:47.558 --> 41:50.109
I bet if we execute this search
warrant we brought with us,

41:50.111 --> 41:52.194
we'd find plenty of it.
Is that true?
