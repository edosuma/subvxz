00:01.369 --> 00:03.171
-9-1-1. What's your emergency?
-(siren wailing)

00:03.204 --> 00:05.206
Let's get him out of here
before this thing blows!

00:05.239 --> 00:07.041
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:07.075 --> 00:08.842
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.876 --> 00:12.012
Empire, The Resident,
and The Gifted.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.582
We are going to show you
the dawn of a new age.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.224
Right in here.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.693
Thanks, guys.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.628
(car alarm chirps)

00:33.401 --> 00:35.536
(engine starts)

00:39.440 --> 00:41.609
(Lorraine screams)

00:41.642 --> 00:46.414
-Oh!
-(Lorraine groaning)

00:46.447 --> 00:48.849
Oh, my leg, my leg.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.584
I think it's broken.

00:50.618 --> 00:54.054
-Oh, my God,
where did you come from?
-Sherman Oaks.

00:54.088 --> 00:56.090
-Ow!
-No.

00:56.124 --> 00:57.591
No, I-I mean, are you okay?

00:57.625 --> 01:01.195
You just hit me with your car!
Of course I'm not okay.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.531
That's a really,
really nice car.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.533
Is that a custom paint job?

01:05.566 --> 01:08.035
(groans): Oh, really hurts
when I move my head.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.403
Is that normal?

01:09.437 --> 01:12.106
(screams):
Ow!

01:12.140 --> 01:15.443
* She works hard for the money

01:15.476 --> 01:17.445
* So hard for it, honey

01:18.579 --> 01:20.448
* She works hard for the money

01:20.481 --> 01:24.485
* So you better
treat her right *

01:25.453 --> 01:29.223
* She works hard for the money

01:29.257 --> 01:31.559
* So hard for it, honey

01:31.592 --> 01:34.595
* She works hard for the money

01:34.628 --> 01:38.266
* So you better
treat her right *

01:39.533 --> 01:41.669
* I met her there

01:41.702 --> 01:44.772
(screams)

01:44.805 --> 01:46.507
* And she wonders where she is

01:46.540 --> 01:48.742
* And it's strange to her

01:48.776 --> 01:53.814
* Some people
seem to have everything *

01:53.847 --> 01:57.351
* 9:00 a.m. on the hour hand

01:57.385 --> 02:00.354
* And she's waiting
for the bell *

02:00.388 --> 02:02.856
* And she's looking
real pretty *

02:02.890 --> 02:06.294
* She's waiting
for her clientele *

02:08.196 --> 02:11.098
* She works hard for the money

02:11.131 --> 02:14.602
* So hard for it, honey

02:14.635 --> 02:16.770
* She works hard for the money

02:16.804 --> 02:20.374
* So you better
treat her right. *

02:20.408 --> 02:21.809
(Lorraine yelps)

02:27.715 --> 02:30.851
(siren wailing, horn honks)

02:36.690 --> 02:39.627
LAFD. Step aside, please.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.330
I didn't know what to do.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.332
I was afraid to move the car.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.366
You did the right thing.
We'll take it

02:45.399 --> 02:46.834
-from here.
-Do any of you have a pen?

02:46.867 --> 02:48.369
I've got
a partial license plate.

02:48.402 --> 02:49.803
Somebody should write it down.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.839
EDDIE: Don't worry
about the license plate, ma'am.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.308
-It's right here
on the back of the car.
-Not this car.

02:54.342 --> 02:55.809
The car that hit me.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.878
Uh, wait, this isn't
the car that hit you?

02:57.911 --> 03:00.314
No, this is the car
that ran me over.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.082
(groans) Better be insured.

03:02.115 --> 03:04.252
Let's just focus on getting you
out of here first, ma'am.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.420
BUCK: I think there's enough
room. We can slide a backboard

03:06.454 --> 03:07.921
under here
and pull her out that way.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.758
-Okay, c-can you tell me
your name?
-Lorraine.

03:10.791 --> 03:11.859
(grunts)

03:16.397 --> 03:19.600
Hey, wait. Don't we know you?

03:19.633 --> 03:22.102
LORRAINE: Uh, no, I don't...
I don't, I don't think so.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.871
HEN:
Last year, Hancock Park.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.406
That's right.
I never forget a femur.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.641
-Hmm.
-(chuckles nervously)

03:28.542 --> 03:31.379
It's the damned Porch Pirate.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.013
(moans)

03:33.046 --> 03:36.384
Guess you moved up from porches
to parking lots, huh, Lorraine?

03:36.417 --> 03:37.718
What's your scam?

03:37.751 --> 03:39.720
I don't know
what you are talking about.

03:39.753 --> 03:43.924
I went to my court-mandated
treatment. I'm completely cured.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.093
Haven't stole a package
in months.

03:46.126 --> 03:49.863
Mm-hmm. I heard you settled
with that homeowner.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.065
The house she fell in front of
when she was package stealing?

03:52.099 --> 03:53.934
I didn't realize you could
sue someone for being injured

03:53.967 --> 03:56.069
during the commission
of a felony.

03:56.103 --> 03:57.638
Pled down to a misdemeanor.

03:57.671 --> 04:00.308
Insurance companies
are happy to settle

04:00.341 --> 04:02.209
instead of going to court.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.579
Insurance companies
are less happy about fraud.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.247
And I got three witnesses
who claim

04:07.281 --> 04:10.484
you intentionally stepped out
behind that poor woman's car.

04:10.518 --> 04:11.885
Makes me wonder
what I might find

04:11.919 --> 04:14.154
when I pull the security footage
from this parking lot.

04:14.187 --> 04:16.557
I think you'll find

04:16.590 --> 04:19.059
a woman suffering
with mobility issues.

04:19.092 --> 04:22.630
Lot of trouble walking
since that fall on the steps.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.231
You know, I wonder

04:24.264 --> 04:27.301
if it's because I received
improper care on the scene.

04:27.335 --> 04:29.670
(laughs)
So you're gonna sue us now?

04:29.703 --> 04:31.572
Oh, you folks
are city employees.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.106
Probably don't make that much.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.508
But the city...

04:34.542 --> 04:36.410
There's probably
some deep pockets there,

04:36.444 --> 04:38.546
don't you think? (moans)

04:40.648 --> 04:42.783
Awful woman.

04:45.353 --> 04:48.088
WOMAN (over phone):
Isn't it your job to help?

04:48.121 --> 04:50.524
I mean, are you even listening
to what I'm saying?

04:50.558 --> 04:53.594
I gave you the address.
What else do you need?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.696
Okay, ma'am,
if you could just calm down

04:55.729 --> 04:56.964
and give me some information.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.799
WOMAN:
Are you deaf? You keep asking

04:58.832 --> 05:00.934
the same stupid questions,
and I keep telling you:

05:00.968 --> 05:03.136
-I don't know.
-Does he have a pulse?

05:03.170 --> 05:04.638
WOMAN:
I'm not touching him, lady.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.507
Do you know where
he's been injured?

05:06.540 --> 05:09.009
-I need a damn ambulance!
-Okay.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.945
The ambulance is on the way.
If you could just tell me...

05:11.979 --> 05:14.014
WOMAN: Why didn't you say that,
you stupid bitch?

05:14.047 --> 05:17.117
-Wasting my time.
-(dial tone)

05:17.150 --> 05:18.519
(groans)

05:24.525 --> 05:26.660
(sighs)

05:28.829 --> 05:30.798
This'll make you feel better.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.800
Delicious and Paleo.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.035
You made Paleo muffins?

05:35.068 --> 05:37.471
I can barely make lunch.
Although I should start,

05:37.505 --> 05:39.807
'cause Jim in the food truck
is getting the wrong idea.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.241
So, what's your secret?

05:41.274 --> 05:45.345
Dee's Bakery on Larchmont,
but don't tell anyone.

05:45.379 --> 05:47.080
Bad call?

05:47.114 --> 05:48.181
Bad day.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.484
It's like the whole city's
in a mood.

05:50.518 --> 05:51.852
That's every day, honey.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.388
There are over 200 languages

05:54.422 --> 05:55.856
spoken in the city
of Los Angeles,

05:55.889 --> 05:58.058
and I've been cursed out
in every single one of them.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.360
It's not like I've never
been yelled at before.

06:00.394 --> 06:04.197
I mean,
I worked in an ER, but...

06:04.231 --> 06:05.666
it just felt different somehow.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.669
You know, maybe it's
because I could see them.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.672
I could see that they
were scared or in pain,

06:11.705 --> 06:14.041
that they didn't mean
to be so...

06:14.074 --> 06:15.543
Awful?

06:15.576 --> 06:18.011
-Does it ever get to you?
-Oh.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.947
I've been doing this
for 20 years.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.583
At some point,
it gets to everyone.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.452
My Stan always used to say,

06:24.485 --> 06:27.187
"Can't bring those people home
with you, Gloria.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.022
They'll wear you down."

06:29.056 --> 06:31.091
I never realized
how right he was

06:31.124 --> 06:33.026
until after he was gone.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.262
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

06:35.295 --> 06:38.098
I'm told he's
in a better place now.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.067
But the thing I learned

06:40.100 --> 06:44.538
is that there's no controlling
someone else's behavior.

06:44.572 --> 06:48.476
But how you react to it,
that's on you.

06:48.509 --> 06:51.545
No, it's just hard not
to take it personally sometimes.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.146
You said you felt different

06:53.180 --> 06:55.916
when you could see
their faces, right?

06:55.949 --> 06:57.485
Maybe that's what you need.

06:57.518 --> 07:00.954
How? I mean, the system isn't
exactly set up for FaceTime.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.390
-Go on a ride-along.
-In a police car?

07:03.423 --> 07:05.559
It should be part
of your training, anyway.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.561
You've heard them on the phone,

07:07.595 --> 07:10.898
and you've been there when
they were wheeled into the ER.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.467
Now get out and see
what happens in between.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.402
-(watch beeps)
-Oh.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.839
Well, time to save the world.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.875
-Josh.
-Morning, Gloria.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.579
Wow, she really
has it all figured out.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.080
She's this place's CÃ©line Dion.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.182
-(chuckles)
-No bull. Just here every day,

07:29.216 --> 07:31.485
getting on that stage
and giving it her all.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.120
("Gloria" by Them playing)

07:33.153 --> 07:34.254
(phone ringing)

07:34.287 --> 07:36.924
-911. What is your emergency?
-WOMAN: Help, please.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.492
My boyfriend's bleeding.
He shot himself

07:38.526 --> 07:41.261
-with one of those nail guns.
-What's your location?

07:41.294 --> 07:45.132
-9534 Sycamore.
Mount Washington.
-Help is on the way.

07:45.165 --> 07:48.335
Do you have a clean cloth
you can apply to the wound?

07:48.368 --> 07:50.103
911. What is your emergency?

07:50.137 --> 07:52.172
MAN: Hi. Yeah, I-I think
someone is breaking in

07:52.205 --> 07:54.608
-to the house next door.
-Okay, do you see anyone?

07:54.642 --> 07:56.143
No. I-I heard some glass break.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.178
So you're calling because
you heard glass breaking?

07:58.211 --> 08:00.180
MAN:
What? No. Well, I mean...

08:00.213 --> 08:01.849
I don't know.
My neighbors are in Florida.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.316
Can you please just send someone
to check it out?

08:03.350 --> 08:06.887
I'd say the real crime is being
in Florida at this time of year.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.488
Try calling a window repairman.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.123
911. What's your emergency?

08:10.157 --> 08:11.992
MAN 2: I'm sitting in a coffee
shop, and this guy just ran up,

08:12.025 --> 08:13.393
grabbed my brand-new bike
and took off.

08:13.426 --> 08:16.129
-Did he break your legs first?
-What? No. What?

08:16.163 --> 08:17.798
Go chase him and get it back.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.132
* G-L-O-R-I-A

08:19.166 --> 08:20.901
How long ago did the pain start?

08:20.934 --> 08:22.469
It's probably gas.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.472
CPR? No, I wouldn't bother.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.241
Well, maybe you should have made
better life choices.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.177
Sir, I think this amount
of crying

08:30.210 --> 08:32.646
is a little over the top
and unproductive,

08:32.680 --> 08:34.214
don't you think?

08:34.247 --> 08:36.416
If you were
really going to jump,

08:36.449 --> 08:37.718
I doubt you'd be calling me.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.219
(sighs)

08:39.252 --> 08:43.023
Gloria, I think you've earned
yourself an extra muffin.

08:51.565 --> 08:52.666
Right there.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.703
-Athena Grant?
-One and only.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.437
-Hi, I'm...
-Maddie Kendall.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.607
New dispatcher here
for your ride-along.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.241
You requested me.

09:01.274 --> 09:04.244
(chuckles)
No one ever requests me.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.880
We have someone in common.
Kendall's my married name.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.682
I actually used to be
Maddie Buckley.

09:08.716 --> 09:09.950
I am again.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.752
Oh, Buckley.
You're Buck's sister.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.622
Yeah, ER nurse from Philly.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.023
Hershey. How did you know that?

09:16.056 --> 09:19.092
Oh, Bobby-- uh, Captain Nash--

09:19.126 --> 09:22.963
said that Buck had a sister
who was new to town.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.298
Your brother's boss is my boo.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.234
(chuckles) Yeah.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.637
Your brother and I
got off on the wrong foot,

09:29.670 --> 09:31.438
but, uh, he's grown on me.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.040
Kid's got a heart of gold.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.876
So, I don't have to call you
Buck-ette or anything, do I?

09:35.909 --> 09:38.411
(laughs):
No, Maddie is fine.

09:38.445 --> 09:41.281
So, how you liking it
so far? L.A.

09:41.314 --> 09:44.251
Well, the traffic
has exceeded my expectations,

09:44.284 --> 09:46.486
and I experienced
my first earthquake.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.555
(chuckles) A 7.1, girl.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.758
You're an official Angeleno now.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.327
(indistinct radio chatter)

09:56.196 --> 09:58.165
So, you don't have a partner?

09:58.198 --> 09:59.967
Field sergeant.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.935
I go where I want
or where I'm needed.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.671
I feel like that's what
I'm doing, too.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.939
Or, at least, I hope it is.

10:05.973 --> 10:09.509
Was it bad?

10:09.542 --> 10:13.280
You said your married name
was Kendall. You come here

10:13.313 --> 10:15.816
to start over?

10:15.849 --> 10:19.419
It was awful.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.521
But I'm not ashamed
to talk about it.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.123
I mean, I was.

10:24.324 --> 10:27.828
Now I realize how strong I am
for getting out.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.462
The day that every woman
in the world

10:29.496 --> 10:32.299
realizes how strong
she really is

10:32.332 --> 10:34.601
is the day
that will bring peace on Earth.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.503
DISPATCHER:
All Wilshire Division units.

10:36.536 --> 10:39.539
Please respond to a 415 group
at Parkview Cemetery.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.441
Request supervisor on scene.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.377
727-L-30. En route.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.513
415. Disturbance?

10:46.546 --> 10:48.615
Yeah. My guess,

10:48.648 --> 10:51.118
another military funeral
protest.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.454
What kind of people would
protest a military funeral?

10:54.487 --> 10:55.956
(siren wailing)

10:55.989 --> 10:58.892
*

11:01.428 --> 11:05.198
PROTESTORS:
Burn in hell will be your fate!

11:05.232 --> 11:07.901
Two, four, six, eight,
burn in hell will be your fate!

11:07.935 --> 11:09.803
Two, four, six, eight,

11:09.837 --> 11:12.039
-burn in hell will be your fate!
-Why don't you have
some respect?

11:12.072 --> 11:13.874
God is not a respecter
of perverts!

11:13.907 --> 11:16.476
-Yeah, well,
you're not God, are you?
-No, and neither are you.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.846
-You should be ashamed
of yourselves!
-I'm not ashamed!

11:18.879 --> 11:21.348
-Take all of yourselves home.
-You-- No, you can go home.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.516
PROTESTORS: ...burn in hell
will be your fate!

11:23.550 --> 11:27.020
Two, four, six, eight,
burn in hell will be your fate!

11:27.054 --> 11:28.555
Two, four, six, eight,

11:28.588 --> 11:30.257
burn in hell will be your fate!

11:30.290 --> 11:33.193
Two, four, six, eight,
burn in hell will be your fate!

11:33.226 --> 11:35.695
-Hey, should I stay in the car?
-Yeah, stay there.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.030
Coming through.
Coming through.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.698
Coming thr...
coming through.

11:38.732 --> 11:39.833
Coming through.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.568
Two, four, six, eight...

11:41.601 --> 11:45.172
Officer, can you please,
please do something about this?

11:45.205 --> 11:47.174
My-my sister's trying
to bury her son.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.843
I understand. And I'm
very sorry for your loss,

11:49.877 --> 11:52.880
-but my best advice
is just to ignore them.
-Are you kidding me?

11:52.913 --> 11:54.114
They've got bullhorns.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.849
This is a funeral.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.450
Do you see
those disgusting signs?

11:57.484 --> 12:00.187
I see 'em, but as long
as they stay behind that fence,

12:00.220 --> 12:02.389
it's their
constitutionally protected right

12:02.422 --> 12:04.291
-to stand there and be awful.
-My nephew

12:04.324 --> 12:05.759
volunteered to serve
because he believed

12:05.793 --> 12:07.961
in protecting the freedom
that gives these...

12:07.995 --> 12:10.463
these idiots the right
to spew their filth.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.933
I'll do what I can.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.434
(fence rattles)

12:14.467 --> 12:17.537
Two, four, six, eight,
burn in hell will be your fate!

12:17.570 --> 12:20.707
Okay, sir, you need to stay
behind the fence.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.042
Or what?

12:22.075 --> 12:24.411
Or your next stop
will be county jail.

12:24.444 --> 12:27.247
Where your black brothers
have been duly incarcerated.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.748
(protestors continue chanting)

12:28.782 --> 12:30.951
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.553
Back it up.
I'm not gonna tell you again.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.223
Well, can I just back up,
or do I have

12:36.256 --> 12:39.392
to pay repar... ations?
(coughing)

12:39.426 --> 12:40.727
All right, folks, take it back.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.297
-Take it behind
the fence. Sir...
-(choking)

12:47.968 --> 12:49.769
-Sir? Sir?
-Get your hands off me.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.304
Get 'em off.
(groaning)

12:51.338 --> 12:55.809
727-L-30, requesting R.A. unit
at Parkview Cemetery.

12:55.843 --> 12:58.178
(sirens wailing)

13:05.819 --> 13:07.020
Sergeant Grant.

13:07.054 --> 13:08.822
Captain.
Mr. Personality over here

13:08.856 --> 13:11.358
starting coughing,
grabbed his side and fell over.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.693
Could be appendicitis.
I'm not sure.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.695
-All right, back up.
-Step aside, please.

13:15.728 --> 13:18.298
Sir, I'm just gonna examine you
for a second here.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.934
Oh. Okay, we got a colostomy
bag, probably backing up.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.270
You're gonna have to intubate
him. Sir, just try to relax.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.105
These paramedics here
are gonna attend to you.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.606
(Scooter groaning)

13:26.639 --> 13:29.376
Oh, hell no.

13:29.409 --> 13:32.279
-You do it.
-BOBBY: Sir, I am not
a trained paramedic.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.781
I can't intubate you.
They can.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.383
(weakly):
I'm fine.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.617
CHIMNEY:
Sir, you're not fine.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.352
Your bowel is
probably obstructed.

13:39.386 --> 13:40.787
The contents
of your colostomy bag

13:40.820 --> 13:42.355
are backing up into your system.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.124
You're about to choke
on your own waste.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.825
You will suffocate and die.

13:45.859 --> 13:47.961
Get... away.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.529
BOBBY:
Okay, sir, if you refuse care,

13:49.562 --> 13:51.965
we cannot administer it
by force.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.967
SCOOTER (groans):
What about him?

13:54.001 --> 13:57.570
"Diaz." Diaz.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.573
-What kind of name is that?
-My father's from Mexico.

14:00.607 --> 14:03.476
My mother's Swedish. I can help
you out with the Swedish half.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.412
But no one told me
which half that is.

14:05.445 --> 14:08.148
Okay, would you like me to call
you another paramedic team

14:08.181 --> 14:10.583
-so you can have
an all-white one?
-Yeah.

14:10.617 --> 14:11.919
He's gonna aspirate.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.553
(retching)

14:14.687 --> 14:15.889
And he's aspirating.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.490
Actual diarrhea of the mouth.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.458
Outstanding.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.029
Okay, guys, let's get to work.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.430
Let me roll him over.

14:23.463 --> 14:27.400
-Ready, Buck?
-Yeah.
-Three, two, one.

14:27.434 --> 14:30.703
-(gagging)
-I need mechanical suction.

14:30.737 --> 14:33.273
-This isn't cutting it.
-We've got suction on the truck.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.008
-Let's get him on the gurney.
Let's go.
-Keep him on his side.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.177
-Let's go.
-We'll bring the gurney
on the other side.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.179
One, two, three, go.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.547
(engine starts)

14:42.115 --> 14:44.351
Well done.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.919
Right, your ride-along
was today. Uh, Cap,

14:45.953 --> 14:48.621
-this is my sister Maddie.
-Great to finally meet you.

14:48.655 --> 14:49.756
Yeah, you, too. I've heard
nothing but wonderful things

14:49.789 --> 14:51.758
-about you.
-Well, don't believe everything

14:51.791 --> 14:55.028
-your little brother tells you.
-I meant from her.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.030
Ah. Well,
the feeling is mutual.

14:57.064 --> 14:59.566
She's something. She never
lets anything get to her.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.035
Get to me?
Do you know how many times

15:02.069 --> 15:05.605
in a given day somebody's got
the opportunity to get to me?

15:05.638 --> 15:07.607
(chuckles) If I start
letting them get to me,

15:07.640 --> 15:09.276
I wouldn't make it
past breakfast.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.211
Which reminds me, we should eat.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.246
Eat? You want to eat after that?

15:13.280 --> 15:15.048
It's lunchtime.

15:15.082 --> 15:17.117
(laughter)

15:19.919 --> 15:21.421
(engine starts)

15:26.426 --> 15:28.161
So, you like her?

15:28.195 --> 15:29.629
Abby? Sure.

15:29.662 --> 15:32.265
You don't approve?
Is it the age difference?

15:32.299 --> 15:34.901
More like the time difference.
Part of me is impressed.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.504
It's the longest relationship
my little brother's ever had.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.672
-Ah, and the other part?
-Can't help but notice

15:39.706 --> 15:42.142
she hasn't been here
for most of it.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.277
Whoa.

15:51.884 --> 15:53.520
Huh. That's weird.

15:53.553 --> 15:57.624
-Hang tight for a second.
-Yeah.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.963
Police.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.632
Anyone here?

16:08.301 --> 16:09.869
(gun cocks)

16:09.902 --> 16:12.639
(liquid boiling, food sizzling)

16:30.523 --> 16:32.659
(loudly):
Is anyone here?

16:34.261 --> 16:36.396
(phone line beeping in distance)

16:41.401 --> 16:42.969
Sir, can you hear me?

16:43.002 --> 16:44.504
(phone line continues beeping)

16:44.537 --> 16:47.140
Sir, can you tell me
what happened?

16:47.174 --> 16:51.010
(gasping):
Robber. Shot.

16:51.044 --> 16:54.814
727-L-30, requesting R.A. units
and additional units

16:54.847 --> 16:58.017
at 12507 Wilshire.

16:58.051 --> 17:00.320
Gunshot wound and apparent 211.

17:00.353 --> 17:03.856
No description of the suspect
at this time.

17:03.890 --> 17:06.093
MAN (over radio):
Copy that. Ten minutes out.

17:06.126 --> 17:08.428
-You said he was talking?
-Yeah, he said a few words,

17:08.461 --> 17:09.696
then he passed out.

17:14.301 --> 17:17.036
Sir? Can you hear me?

17:17.070 --> 17:20.107
(scissors cutting)

17:20.140 --> 17:22.875
Uh, okay, um, I need something
to seal this with.

17:22.909 --> 17:25.345
The-the air is being pulled
into his thoracic cavity

17:25.378 --> 17:26.713
instead of his lungs.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.048
-Uh, plastic wrap?
-Perfect.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.950
Here. Three pieces of tape.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.324
Thanks.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.232
Okay, lost his pulse.
Moving to compressions.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.736
Okay, you know what,
I need the blood

17:49.769 --> 17:51.904
to keep flowing to his heart.
Can you elevate his legs?

17:58.978 --> 18:01.381
(gasps)

18:01.414 --> 18:03.216
(panting)

18:03.250 --> 18:05.051
You're gonna be okay, sir.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.719
The ambulance is almost here.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.621
(weakly):
How you here?

18:08.655 --> 18:11.824
-They hang up.
-ATHENA: Sir?

18:11.858 --> 18:13.960
Who hung up on you?

18:13.993 --> 18:15.762
911.

18:16.629 --> 18:19.466
(phone line continues beeping)

18:26.473 --> 18:28.608
I still can't believe it.
Who just hangs up?

18:28.641 --> 18:31.178
I mean, if we hadn't been there,
he would have died.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.445
And you get a gold star

18:32.479 --> 18:34.481
for saving him,
Nurse Nellie Forbush,

18:34.514 --> 18:37.784
but ten demerit points
for jumping to conclusions.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.952
He probably got disconnected.
Spotty cell service

18:39.986 --> 18:41.754
or he hit a wrong button.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.557
It happens.
Sometimes people panic.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.261
Fine.

18:48.295 --> 18:51.464
Do you have the number
he called from?

18:51.498 --> 18:53.466
GLORIA (recorded):
911. What is your emergency?

18:53.500 --> 18:55.602
LANH:
Help! A robber. He shot me.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.437
GLORIA:
What? What did you say?

18:57.470 --> 18:59.138
LANH:
Ma Xun Restaurant on Wilshire.

18:59.172 --> 19:01.774
-Please, please help. Send help.
-I can't understand you.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.777
Speak louder or I'm hanging up.

19:04.811 --> 19:05.778
It can't be her.

19:05.812 --> 19:09.015
LANH:
Shot. Bleeding. Help now.

19:09.048 --> 19:11.518
GLORIA: Yelling at me
won't stop the bleeding, okay?

19:11.551 --> 19:12.785
I'm not the one who shot you.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.855
-(speaking Vietnamese)
-Seriously?

19:15.888 --> 19:18.291
You're switching
to another language now?

19:18.325 --> 19:20.327
(clicks)

19:20.360 --> 19:22.329
That wasn't a mistake.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.732
Gloria hung up on him.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.536
Guys?

19:29.569 --> 19:32.071
Careful!
Guys, be easy with her.

19:32.104 --> 19:35.007
She's not a puppy.

19:35.041 --> 19:36.476
Hey, listen...

19:36.509 --> 19:41.381
I am glad that Athena
got someone new.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.982
Okay? No, I am.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.151
Y-You should have heard what
Harry told me the other day.

19:45.184 --> 19:49.088
He says, "Dad, doesn't it seem
weird that you're an architect

19:49.121 --> 19:50.923
"and Bobby is a firefighter?

19:50.957 --> 19:54.927
"I mean, you're there
when the buildings go up,

19:54.961 --> 19:57.564
but he's there when it burns
down to the ground."

19:57.597 --> 19:59.065
-(laughter)
-KAREN: Wow.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.535
Symbolism much?

20:02.569 --> 20:04.671
Hey, you know,
Bobby is a good man,

20:04.704 --> 20:07.540
and I think that's what makes it
a little bit harder.

20:07.574 --> 20:11.177
I mean, he has this
natural paternal quality.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.346
KAREN:
Well, listen,

20:13.380 --> 20:14.881
you don't need to worry.

20:14.914 --> 20:18.084
'Cause you are those babies'
father, and they know it.

20:18.117 --> 20:22.389
And anything they get from him
is just extra.

20:23.456 --> 20:27.594
Yeah, that's right.
(laughs)

20:27.627 --> 20:29.462
(toy squeaks)

20:31.063 --> 20:32.732
(dog whining)

20:34.467 --> 20:37.604
Well, he's amazing.
What's his name?

20:37.637 --> 20:39.205
She's a she. Paisley.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.873
My mama rescued her.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.208
I bet she did.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.511
HARRY:
Um, where's your dog?

20:47.246 --> 20:48.448
Son of a bitch.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.786
Boys, boys.
Let's go, let's go.

20:53.820 --> 20:57.223
Hey, guys, come on.
Who wants some food, huh?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.392
You evil...

20:59.426 --> 21:01.160
Excuse me?

21:01.193 --> 21:02.662
What did you say to him?

21:02.695 --> 21:05.665
You mean did I tell him
I was his real mother?

21:05.698 --> 21:08.000
-Not yet.
-You're not his real mother.

21:08.034 --> 21:11.237
You signed away all rights
to him the day he was born.

21:11.270 --> 21:15.442
You're right, I signed away
all my parental rights.

21:15.475 --> 21:18.478
But he didn't.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.951
Who the hell is he?

21:24.984 --> 21:26.619
That's Nathaniel.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.989
That's Denny's
biological father.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.258
He didn't even know
he had a kid.

21:32.291 --> 21:36.929
You told me you didn't know
who the father was.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.931
I lied.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.634
-You're lying now.
-Am I?

21:43.570 --> 21:46.439
We'll find out.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.641
I'll see you in court.

22:01.087 --> 22:03.222
(elevator bell dings)

22:07.660 --> 22:08.828
Hi. Now's not a good time.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.397
Why don't you
take a longer lunch?

22:10.430 --> 22:12.965
What?

22:12.999 --> 22:15.502
Oh, are they reprimanding her
for hanging up?

22:15.535 --> 22:16.903
-Good.
-No.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.571
They're firing her for hang-ups.

22:18.605 --> 22:21.040
Yeah, plural. Hundreds,

22:21.073 --> 22:23.309
maybe thousands,
going back eight months.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.745
-Eight months?!
-That last part makes sense.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.880
She went a little squirrelly
after the divorce.

22:27.914 --> 22:30.149
Uh, I thought
her husband was dead.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.984
She only wishes he were.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.486
She's probably facing
criminal charges.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.921
There's precedent.

22:34.954 --> 22:37.724
911 dispatcher
in Houston got 18 months

22:37.757 --> 22:39.258
for interfering
with emergency calls.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.593
(door opens)

22:40.627 --> 22:43.329
You! You traitor!

22:43.362 --> 22:45.698
-Talk later.
-I was nice to you,
I helped you.

22:45.732 --> 22:48.167
I showed you where
we hide the good coffee pods,

22:48.200 --> 22:49.536
and you betrayed me.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.771
They want to put me in jail
because of what you said!

22:51.804 --> 22:54.741
You hung up on people
on purpose.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.509
Awful people!

22:56.543 --> 22:59.111
People who yell
and scream and cry

22:59.145 --> 23:01.347
and expect you
to do something for them.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.950
I mean, and do they ever say,
"How are you?" Do they ever ask,

23:03.983 --> 23:05.351
"How are you doing, Gloria?"

23:05.384 --> 23:07.520
Do they ever think
of anything but themselves

23:07.554 --> 23:08.955
and what they need? No!

23:08.988 --> 23:12.892
You give them everything
you have, and then

23:12.925 --> 23:15.595
they leave you for your sister!
You know, Maddie,

23:15.628 --> 23:17.363
-I'm...
-Ma'am, it's time to go.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.199
This... You can't just
toss me into the trash!

23:20.232 --> 23:24.270
I won "Outstanding Dispatcher"
eight times.

23:24.303 --> 23:26.806
-(elevator bell dings)
-I took more calls than anyone.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.941
Half of them were
under 45 seconds.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.043
GLORIA:
This isn't over, Maddie!

23:31.077 --> 23:34.280
Just mark my words.
Snitches get stitches!

23:48.327 --> 23:51.330
-(dog whining)
-KAREN: But what does that
mean for us?

23:51.363 --> 23:52.899
What rights does that give him?

23:52.932 --> 23:55.935
Here. Little man,
take Paisley to your room.

23:55.968 --> 23:57.269
(Karen speaks indistinctly)

23:59.606 --> 24:02.809
KAREN:
Look... Hen just walked in.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.745
Okay.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.880
Thanks, Mark.

24:09.381 --> 24:13.653
Never a good sign hearing from
your lawyer after office hours.

24:14.854 --> 24:17.189
Well, the lab report came back.

24:17.223 --> 24:20.827
Nathaniel Green is Denny's
biological father.

24:24.396 --> 24:26.699
What does that mean?

24:26.733 --> 24:30.102
It means... he has rights.

24:30.136 --> 24:33.172
It means he could try
to take our son away from us.

24:33.205 --> 24:35.875
-What does Mark say?
-That we're screwed.

24:35.908 --> 24:38.545
I mean, he used
more lawyerly words.

24:38.578 --> 24:39.946
Our case is
more "challenging" now.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.147
And, "The court will have to

24:41.180 --> 24:43.115
"balance the interests
of the child

24:43.149 --> 24:46.686
against the birth mother's
fraudulent acts."

24:48.988 --> 24:50.723
HEN:
Okay. Okay, listen.

24:50.757 --> 24:52.224
Let me talk to Athena.

24:52.258 --> 24:54.627
There's got to be more
to this guy's story.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.062
Maybe she can do some digging,

24:56.095 --> 24:57.964
find out something
that we can use against him.

24:57.997 --> 25:02.869
All this just because that awful
woman wanted to hurt you.

25:02.902 --> 25:06.138
Why did you bring her back
into our lives?

25:06.172 --> 25:07.674
Karen, listen.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.813
-I was stupid.
-Hmm.

25:13.846 --> 25:16.015
I was selfish.

25:17.449 --> 25:19.218
I was weak.

25:19.251 --> 25:23.923
And I'm sorry.
I'm so... so very sorry.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.159
I know you're sorry...

25:27.193 --> 25:30.329
and you never meant
for any of this to happen.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.498
I know that in my head,

25:32.531 --> 25:35.434
but the rest of me...

25:35.467 --> 25:37.704
is having a really hard time.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.755
Mama?

26:03.395 --> 26:05.531
Mama sounded mad.

26:05.564 --> 26:08.467
Yeah, Mommy just got
some bad news tonight.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.269
She's just upset.

26:10.302 --> 26:13.773
She was really mad at the park
when I talked to that lady.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.742
Is she mad at me?

26:15.775 --> 26:18.444
Mm-mm, not even a little bit.

26:18.477 --> 26:22.381
Mommy and I love you more
than anything.

26:22.414 --> 26:26.418
Can you fix the bad thing
like you fix people at work?

26:29.488 --> 26:31.423
Yeah.

26:32.759 --> 26:35.094
Don't you worry, little man.

26:35.127 --> 26:37.964
Mama's gonna fix everything.

26:46.438 --> 26:49.241
So she hangs up on a thousand
people, and it's your fault

26:49.275 --> 26:51.310
-she got fired?
-Oh, not just fired.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.079
The LAPD has launched
an investigation.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.915
She could go to jail,
which I guess is also my fault,

26:55.948 --> 26:58.317
because I violated a code
when I reported her.

26:58.350 --> 27:00.086
I don't even know
what that means.

27:00.119 --> 27:01.754
Like, a 911 dispatcher code?

27:01.788 --> 27:03.455
They say
cops have that blue line.

27:03.489 --> 27:05.257
Yeah, well, I wear maroon.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.593
Anyway, she just kept texting
and calling,

27:07.626 --> 27:09.662
so I had to shut my phone off.

27:09.696 --> 27:13.432
(phone vibrating)

27:13.465 --> 27:17.203
Ugh. Guess who? Looks like
Gloria's not done yelling at me.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.938
BUCK:
Want me to talk to her?

27:18.971 --> 27:21.207
No, I just want
to ignore her completely,

27:21.240 --> 27:23.710
and she'll go away eventually,
I hope.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.477
I can't smash
another cell phone.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.221
*

27:40.592 --> 27:43.329
(engine starts)

27:51.838 --> 27:54.240
(siren wailing in distance)

28:04.050 --> 28:06.418
(phone vibrating)

28:14.626 --> 28:16.595
Hey.

28:16.628 --> 28:18.831
KAREN:
Hey. Um...

28:18.865 --> 28:21.500
I'm sorry about before.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.036
This isn't your fault.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.538
I'm just scared. (scoffs)

28:28.407 --> 28:30.376
Babe?

28:30.409 --> 28:32.611
Yeah, I'm...

28:32.644 --> 28:34.580
I'm scared, too.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.750
Where are you?

28:37.784 --> 28:41.453
HEN: Just out for a drive.
I need to clear my head.

28:41.487 --> 28:43.756
All I feel is rage,

28:43.790 --> 28:47.026
just boiling over in me.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.862
Just come home, babe.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.898
I love you.

28:51.931 --> 28:54.600
HEN:
I love you, too.

29:19.691 --> 29:22.561
Eva?

29:22.594 --> 29:24.396
Eva!

29:24.430 --> 29:27.299
Open up the damn door!
I know you're in there.

29:27.333 --> 29:28.600
Eva!

29:28.634 --> 29:30.970
(glass breaking)

29:37.443 --> 29:38.945
Eva?!

29:41.513 --> 29:43.282
Damn it.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.359
(gurgling)

30:06.973 --> 30:09.141
(gurgling continues)

30:25.057 --> 30:26.725
(line ringing)

30:29.828 --> 30:32.231
PARAMEDIC:
That's it.

30:32.264 --> 30:33.699
That's good.
Okay, sit up for me.

30:33.732 --> 30:35.567
-(Eva groans)
-Lean against the wall there.

30:35.601 --> 30:38.637
Okay. Okay. Okay.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.206
(Eva sighs softly)

30:42.408 --> 30:43.342
No.

30:43.375 --> 30:44.911
What the hell is she doing here?

30:44.944 --> 30:47.146
PARAMEDIC:
She called it in.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.414
Saved your life.

30:48.447 --> 30:50.716
That's because she loves me.

30:50.749 --> 30:52.284
(Hen scoffs, laughs)

30:53.785 --> 30:55.821
I don't even hate you, Eva.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.157
I feel nothing for you.

30:58.190 --> 31:01.727
Then why were you here?

31:03.862 --> 31:06.933
I called your parole officer.

31:06.966 --> 31:09.835
He'll meet you at the hospital.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.771
Good luck in prison.

31:12.804 --> 31:14.240
You saved me, Hen!

31:14.273 --> 31:16.408
I save awful people every day.
It's my job.

31:22.781 --> 31:25.217
Sergeant Grant.
You're the one called it in?

31:25.251 --> 31:26.585
I saw the bulletin
you guys sent out

31:26.618 --> 31:28.420
-about your robbery suspect.
-Mm-hmm.

31:28.454 --> 31:31.123
Patient just came in.
White man in his 20s

31:31.157 --> 31:33.359
with untreated burns
and a sketchy demeanor.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.761
Yeah. Victim threw hot oil
in his face.

31:35.794 --> 31:38.097
I thought he might
seek medical treatment.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.598
This one said
he did it grilling,

31:39.631 --> 31:41.300
but the burn pattern's
all wrong.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.202
Plus, the wounds are more
than a day old.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.603
He's got a massive infection

31:44.636 --> 31:46.205
and keeps screaming
about the pain.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.240
Well, let's see
if we can't give him something

31:48.274 --> 31:50.076
to take his mind off that.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.877
(knocks on door)

31:51.910 --> 31:54.780
Mr. Davis, can I come in?

32:00.286 --> 32:02.421
(glass breaking)

32:23.542 --> 32:28.680
727-L-30 requesting R.A. unit
at Carthay Urgent Care,

32:28.714 --> 32:31.083
2952 Carlson Avenue.

32:31.117 --> 32:35.421
I have an unconscious suspect
in need of medical attention.

32:35.454 --> 32:38.090
-You got him?
-ATHENA (over phone): Yeah.

32:38.124 --> 32:40.659
Owner got him good
with that hot oil.

32:40.692 --> 32:43.762
Burns were like a scarlet
letter all over his face,

32:43.795 --> 32:45.764
except the "A"
didn't stand for "adulterer"

32:45.797 --> 32:47.199
in this particular case.

32:47.233 --> 32:48.600
MADDIE:
What about the restaurant owner?

32:48.634 --> 32:51.270
-Out of ICU and on the mend.
-Amazing.

32:51.303 --> 32:54.840
-Hey, thanks for letting me
ride shotgun with you.
-Sure.

32:54.873 --> 32:57.643
Nothing like some blood and bile
and bullets to help you see

32:57.676 --> 33:00.379
how special it is what you do
on that phone every day.

33:00.412 --> 33:02.614
MADDIE: First of all, I'm pretty
sure that wasn't bile.

33:02.648 --> 33:05.551
And second, it wasn't just
the calls that we answered,

33:05.584 --> 33:06.818
it was you.

33:06.852 --> 33:08.687
I mean, now if I have
a moment of doubt,

33:08.720 --> 33:10.456
I can just say,
"What would Athena do?"

33:10.489 --> 33:12.724
You're too kind. (laughs)

33:12.758 --> 33:15.661
I guess those golden hearts
run in the Buckley family.

33:15.694 --> 33:18.664
-Take care, Buck-ette.
-You, too, Sergeant.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.569
(phone vibrates)

33:23.602 --> 33:24.903
Hello.

33:24.936 --> 33:26.205
GLORIA (over phone):
Maddie.

33:26.238 --> 33:28.640
Glad I finally got you.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.176
(sighs)

33:30.209 --> 33:31.743
Stop calling me.

33:31.777 --> 33:32.878
Stop texting me.

33:32.911 --> 33:34.213
Leave me alone.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.482
GLORIA: But I have so much
free time now.

33:36.515 --> 33:37.816
I could call you all day.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.651
MADDIE (over speaker): I mean,
what do you want from me?

33:39.685 --> 33:41.019
Do you want me to say
that I'm sorry

33:41.053 --> 33:42.988
for turning you in
for almost killing a man?

33:43.021 --> 33:45.991
-I'm not.
-I tried to teach you
something important.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.227
Oh, here's a little something
I learned.

33:50.196 --> 33:52.164
(sighs)

33:52.198 --> 33:54.166
(dialing)

33:54.200 --> 33:57.203
(line ringing)

34:03.275 --> 34:05.077
This call is being recorded.

34:05.111 --> 34:08.347
I think I might be having
an actual emergency.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.749
Unbelievable.
How did you even...?

34:10.782 --> 34:12.451
GLORIA:
Get transferred to you directly?

34:12.484 --> 34:14.720
This is Officer Donnelly.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.922
513-Mary-12.
Responding to a 207.

34:16.955 --> 34:20.926
I've got an 11-58 and need to
keep off the airwaves.

34:20.959 --> 34:23.095
Can you patch me through
to my dispatcher?

34:23.129 --> 34:25.131
Who is Officer Donnelly?

34:25.164 --> 34:27.199
I made her up.
(laughs)

34:27.233 --> 34:28.767
Because I know the system,
Maddie.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.869
Until yesterday,
I was the system.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.271
But you took that from me.

34:32.304 --> 34:35.073
Ma'am, it is against the law

34:35.107 --> 34:36.808
to call 911 for non-emergencies.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.311
It's also a crime to impersonate
a police officer.

34:39.345 --> 34:41.147
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to report this.

34:41.180 --> 34:43.549
Don't you dare "ma'am" me
or tell me about the law.

34:43.582 --> 34:45.251
Your whole generation
is nothing

34:45.284 --> 34:47.553
but a bunch of lazy ingrates.

34:47.586 --> 34:50.656
You have no clue
what it's like... (screams)

35:02.100 --> 35:04.002
(groaning)

35:06.305 --> 35:07.939
MADDIE:
Gloria?

35:07.973 --> 35:09.741
(Gloria groans)

35:09.775 --> 35:12.978
MADDIE:
What just happened? Gloria?

35:15.113 --> 35:17.183
Maddie?

35:17.216 --> 35:19.151
Are you still there?

35:19.185 --> 35:21.653
I think I was in an accident.

35:21.687 --> 35:24.356
MADDIE:
I-I'm here. Where are you?

35:28.126 --> 35:30.329
-(door thuds)
-(grunts softly)

35:30.362 --> 35:32.331
(moans)

35:32.364 --> 35:34.099
(whimpering):
I can't get out.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.101
I can't get out.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.036
I'm stuck.

35:38.069 --> 35:39.438
Why can't I hear you?

35:39.471 --> 35:41.139
-Gloria, I'm here.
-Did you hang up?

35:41.173 --> 35:43.842
-I'm here.
I don't think she can hear me.
-God, I hope you didn't hang up.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.377
-The airbags probably deployed.
-GLORIA: I mean...

35:45.411 --> 35:46.612
She wouldn't be able
to hear anything.

35:46.645 --> 35:47.713
GLORIA: It's definitely
what I would have done,

35:47.746 --> 35:49.781
-but I hope you didn't do it.
-Okay, so we'll

35:49.815 --> 35:50.816
have to do this the hard way.

35:50.849 --> 35:52.718
Cell tower is giving me
this radius,

35:52.751 --> 35:54.520
but I don't see any reports
in the area.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.955
SUE:
Okay, here.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.525
I have to call someone.

35:59.558 --> 36:01.727
But I lost my phone.

36:03.362 --> 36:05.231
MADDIE:
Air Support, I need assistance

36:05.264 --> 36:07.132
getting a visual on a vehicle.

36:07.165 --> 36:11.370
I really wish you were
still on the line.

36:12.704 --> 36:15.307
I wouldn't blame you
if you hung up on me.

36:15.341 --> 36:16.975
That's what I would have done.

36:17.008 --> 36:20.379
I don't know why.
That's a lie.

36:20.412 --> 36:22.414
I do know why.

36:22.448 --> 36:26.485
Dead-end calls.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.254
Not sure if you've had one yet,

36:28.287 --> 36:31.156
but it's when
you can hear everything

36:31.189 --> 36:34.159
that's happening on
the other end of the line,

36:34.192 --> 36:35.661
and you know

36:35.694 --> 36:39.531
there's not gonna be anything
that you can do.

36:39.565 --> 36:42.934
Except sit there and listen
to someone die.

36:42.968 --> 36:44.936
(sighs)

36:44.970 --> 36:47.839
It happened to me.

36:47.873 --> 36:50.576
Stan had served me with papers
that morning, and I,

36:50.609 --> 36:54.746
and I got a call from this girl.

36:54.780 --> 36:57.683
She was hiding under
a desk because...

36:57.716 --> 37:01.553
a client came in with a gun.

37:01.587 --> 37:03.889
I could hear the shots-- one,

37:03.922 --> 37:06.425
then another.

37:06.458 --> 37:08.894
Getting closer.

37:08.927 --> 37:13.532
(crying): I knew
what was coming, so I...

37:13.565 --> 37:15.901
I just, I...

37:15.934 --> 37:18.370
I hung up.

37:18.404 --> 37:22.808
And I-I felt so relieved.

37:24.443 --> 37:28.414
She wasn't my problem anymore.

37:29.448 --> 37:32.083
After that,
nothing was my problem.

37:32.117 --> 37:34.286
Until you.

37:34.320 --> 37:37.489
You're gonna be okay, Gloria.

37:37.523 --> 37:41.327
Since I'm making my peace, I...

37:41.360 --> 37:44.162
I don't know if I should...

37:44.195 --> 37:45.997
apologize to you or...

37:46.031 --> 37:48.467
or forgive you,
but I should do more...

37:48.500 --> 37:50.669
(horn honking)

37:53.305 --> 37:55.441
You didn't hang up.

37:55.474 --> 37:58.176
You didn't.

37:58.209 --> 38:00.312
No.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.614
-You're here.
-I'm still here.

38:04.483 --> 38:06.618
(sighs)

38:14.159 --> 38:15.594
He's a straight arrow.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.363
Owns his own home.

38:17.396 --> 38:18.597
Stable job.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.766
Manager at Home Depot.

38:20.799 --> 38:23.435
Employee of the month
three times.

38:23.469 --> 38:24.936
Yeah, good credit.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.506
And he counsels at-risk kids
on the weekends.

38:27.539 --> 38:29.641
Oh, you got to be joking me.

38:29.675 --> 38:32.378
How are we gonna win
against this guy?

38:32.411 --> 38:33.712
He's freaking perfect.

38:33.745 --> 38:35.313
He wasn't always.

38:35.347 --> 38:37.883
Seven years ago, he was a mess.

38:37.916 --> 38:41.453
He started drinking after
his wife died of ovarian cancer.

38:41.487 --> 38:44.656
Series of DUIs landed him
in rehab.

38:44.690 --> 38:46.858
-Where he met Eva.
-Mm-hmm.

38:46.892 --> 38:51.630
I-I still-- I can't believe
she's doing this.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.632
That she could hate me so much.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.333
Eva isn't your problem anymore.

38:55.367 --> 38:57.803
She broke her parole. Hard.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.838
She's going back inside.

39:02.374 --> 39:05.844
I had this moment, 'Thena,
I was standing over her.

39:08.714 --> 39:13.519
And I thought about just...
not helping her.

39:14.853 --> 39:17.255
I almost let her die.

39:19.124 --> 39:21.593
Does that make me
an awful person?

39:21.627 --> 39:23.429
Mm-mm.

39:23.462 --> 39:25.497
It makes you a human being.

39:25.531 --> 39:27.065
A good one.

39:27.098 --> 39:30.035
Because despite everything
that she put you through,

39:30.068 --> 39:34.272
you still saved her
ungrateful ass.

39:34.305 --> 39:36.875
And now this...

39:36.908 --> 39:40.245
this man can come
and take my son.

39:40.278 --> 39:44.115
My wife will not forever
forgive me for that.

39:44.149 --> 39:46.885
Stop. Enough of that.

39:46.918 --> 39:48.854
No one's taking Denny.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.522
All right?
This isn't about that.

39:50.556 --> 39:52.691
All he wants is visitation.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.360
Yeah, he has a case,
but so do you and Karen.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.962
You love that boy.

39:56.995 --> 39:59.865
And anyone who spends five
minutes with you can see that.

39:59.898 --> 40:02.768
This Nathaniel Green will, too.

40:06.171 --> 40:08.239
But will he care?

40:08.273 --> 40:10.208
You got to have faith.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.977
*

40:12.010 --> 40:15.781
Yeah, people can be awful.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.317
Selfish and cruel.

40:19.350 --> 40:20.719
* Lately...

40:20.752 --> 40:24.456
Caring only about themselves
and what they want and need.

40:24.490 --> 40:25.891
* No holding back

40:25.924 --> 40:29.060
* No point in wasting sorrow

40:29.094 --> 40:34.065
* On things that won't be
here tomorrow *

40:34.099 --> 40:36.468
Never thinking about
who they hurt,

40:36.502 --> 40:39.571
or what kind of damage they
might leave in their wake.

40:39.605 --> 40:41.006
Oh, good, you're conscious.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.908
Just need to have a few words
with you.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.676
-What?
-First up,

40:44.710 --> 40:46.578
you have the right
to remain silent.

40:46.612 --> 40:47.746
(crying)

40:47.779 --> 40:49.981
* Tell me it's okay

40:50.015 --> 40:52.684
BOBBY: Gloria? Gloria, my name
is Bobby. We're here to help.

40:52.718 --> 40:54.586
-Okay. Yeah.
-Okay, just try to stay calm.

40:54.620 --> 40:56.287
-You're gonna be all right.
-Okay.

40:56.321 --> 40:57.656
Okay? We're gonna cut you
out of there.

40:57.689 --> 40:59.257
ATHENA:
But not everyone is awful.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.426
There's some good ones
out there, too.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.962
The kind who want to do
the right thing.

41:03.995 --> 41:07.332
* I know it's a shame

41:07.365 --> 41:09.434
*

41:09.467 --> 41:11.169
Maddie, good work.

41:11.202 --> 41:13.304
Gloria said
some pretty awful things.

41:13.338 --> 41:14.806
I'm glad you didn't let it
get to you.

41:14.840 --> 41:15.941
That's the job, right?

41:15.974 --> 41:17.208
If I let everyone get to me,

41:17.242 --> 41:19.310
I wouldn't make it
past breakfast.

41:19.344 --> 41:22.280
ATHENA: But you'll never know
which kind of person someone is

41:22.313 --> 41:25.216
unless you give them
a chance to show you.

41:25.250 --> 41:29.187
* I have spent so much
of my time *

41:29.220 --> 41:33.191
NATHANIEL: I can tell
Denny has a good life here.

41:33.224 --> 41:35.460
* To be of use

41:35.493 --> 41:37.729
And I don't want to harm that
in any way.

41:37.763 --> 41:41.032
You're his parents.

41:41.066 --> 41:44.402
You tell me what's best for him
and I'll follow your lead.

41:44.435 --> 41:47.806
ATHENA:
Maybe they'll surprise you...

41:47.839 --> 41:50.976
in the best way.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.679
* I know it's a shame

41:53.712 --> 41:55.013
BOBBY:
Okay, everybody, let's eat.

41:56.748 --> 41:58.650
Hen. How'd it go?

41:58.684 --> 42:00.185
Good.

42:00.218 --> 42:01.753
Great.

42:01.787 --> 42:03.488
I think it's gonna be okay.

42:03.521 --> 42:04.823
(clears throat)

42:04.856 --> 42:06.424
Yes, Athena.

42:06.457 --> 42:07.993
-You were right.
-(laughs)

42:08.026 --> 42:09.494
BOBBY:
She usually is.

42:09.527 --> 42:12.397
In fact, I find it best
just not to argue with her.

42:12.430 --> 42:14.566
* Shame.

42:14.600 --> 42:16.034
ATHENA:
Our lives are shaped,

42:16.067 --> 42:18.570
not just by our experiences,

42:18.604 --> 42:21.840
but by relationships.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.842
Who we love.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.343
Who loves us.

42:25.376 --> 42:29.114
And the stronger
those ties are,

42:29.147 --> 42:33.251
the less awful
everything else seems.

42:46.431 --> 42:49.768
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

43:15.861 --> 43:18.163
You've answered the call
on 9-1-1.

43:18.196 --> 43:20.465
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

43:23.101 --> 43:24.302
Buckle up, buttercup.

43:26.638 --> 43:28.974
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

43:29.007 --> 43:32.577
-* We're breaking waves
shooting star *
-(siren wailing)

43:32.610 --> 43:36.147
* We live for glory
not forever *

43:36.181 --> 43:37.182
MAN: Touchdown!

43:37.215 --> 43:40.786
* Reach out *

43:40.819 --> 43:44.422
* Make this right here
right now *

43:44.455 --> 43:47.358
* Stand up *

43:48.226 --> 43:49.995
* Here right now *

43:50.028 --> 43:51.997
That sounds like fun.
