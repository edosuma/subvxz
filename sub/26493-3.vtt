SPENCER JAMES?
BILLY BAKER,

00:02.930 --> 00:05.024
VARSITY COACH,
BEVERLY HIGH.

00:05.030 --> 00:06.293
I'll CUT TO THE CHASE,
SPENCER.

00:06.300 --> 00:08.621
I NEED YOU TO COME
PLAY FOR ME.

00:08.630 --> 00:09.995
WE CAN OFFER YOU SOMETHING
THAT CRENSHAW CAN'T--

00:10.200 --> 00:12.191
A BETTER EDUCATION IN A SAFER
SCHOOL. I CAN GET YOU A WAY OUT.

00:12.200 --> 00:15.192
GRACE: YOU THINK I DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT THAT
SHOOTING OVER AT CRENSHAW THE OTHER NIGHT,

00:15.200 --> 00:16.690
THAT I DIDN'T GET A CALL
ABOUT YOUR LITTLE FIGHT?

00:16.700 --> 00:17.997
YOU'VE BEEN IN
AND OUT OF TROUBLE

00:18.000 --> 00:19.252
AT THAT SCHOOL FOR YEARS.

00:19.260 --> 00:21.092
COOP: THINK ABOUT
DILLON, YOUR MOMS.

00:21.100 --> 00:23.956
YOU COULD REALLY GET
THEM A BETTER LIFE.

00:23.960 --> 00:25.519
SPENCER: SO YOU'RE ROLLING
WITH GANGBANGERS NOW.

00:25.530 --> 00:26.349
I GOT IT HANDLED.

00:26.430 --> 00:28.194
NO, YOU GOT IT TWISTED
IS WHAT YOU GOT.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.019
DILLON: WHERE YOU GOING?

00:29.100 --> 00:30.829
TO MAKE SURE SHAWN
LEAVES YOU THE HELL ALONE.

00:30.830 --> 00:32.025
YOU SAID YOU HAD IT
HANDLED.

00:32.030 --> 00:33.225
I THOUGHT I DID.

00:33.230 --> 00:34.629
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU AND I

00:34.630 --> 00:35.825
ARE ON THE SAME PAGE.

00:35.830 --> 00:37.025
THERE IS NO "YOU AND I."

00:37.030 --> 00:38.953
IT WAS ONE DRUG-INDUCED
SCREW-UP.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.496
WE GOT CAUGHT UP
IN THE MOMENT,

00:40.500 --> 00:43.891
AND I HAD TO WALK AWAY FROM
MY BEST FRIEND BECAUSE OF IT.

00:43.900 --> 00:46.050
LOOK, I CAN PLAY BOTH WAYS,
COACH, OFFENSE AND DEFENSE.

00:46.060 --> 00:48.097
YOU ARE BURNING IT AT
BOTH ENDS OFF THE FIELD.

00:48.100 --> 00:50.250
I CAN'T HAVE YOU DOING
IT ON THE FIELD AS WELL.

00:50.260 --> 00:52.126
JORDAN: SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.
I THINK HE'S HURTING.

00:52.130 --> 00:53.393
JUST HIT YOUR RECEIVERS.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.027
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME,
I'M HITTING EVERYONE

00:55.030 --> 00:56.657
WHO KNOWS THE PLAYBOOK.

01:01.560 --> 01:06.054
["BORN FOR THIS"
BY 7KINGZ PLAYING]

01:06.430 --> 01:08.853
SOMETHING'S COMING

01:13.630 --> 01:16.224
SOMETHING'S COMING

01:17.400 --> 01:19.289
SOMETHING'S COMING

01:26.230 --> 01:27.698
DASHES, LET'S GO.

01:27.700 --> 01:30.055
OOH

01:31.600 --> 01:32.999
STOP DRAGGING.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.197
YOU'RE ONLY MAKING IT
WORSE FOR YOURSELF.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.294
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO
THESE TWO-A-DAYS

01:38.300 --> 01:43.158
UNTIL YOU SHOW ME THAT YOU
CAN WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.691
I'M NOT FEELING IT YET.

01:45.700 --> 01:47.429
LET'S GO.

01:47.430 --> 01:49.353
SWITCH IT UP.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.550
DUDE, CHILL. MY DAD
ALWAYS RIDES US HARD

01:55.560 --> 01:56.755
AFTER WE LOSE A GAME.
YOU KNOW THAT.

01:56.760 --> 02:00.128
YEAH, WE DIDN'T LOSE
THAT GAME. HE DID.

02:00.130 --> 02:02.189
LOOK, I HAVEN'T HAD A
GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP ALL WEEK

02:02.200 --> 02:05.124
BECAUSE HOMEBOY HERE
CAN'T HOLD ONTO THE DAMN BALL.

02:05.130 --> 02:08.395
HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO MADE A BAD CALL LAST WEEK.

02:11.830 --> 02:14.026
LISTEN UP, GUYS, WE WIN
AS A TEAM AND WE LOSE AS--

02:14.030 --> 02:17.022
YEAH, WE KNOW, OK?
WE KNOW.

02:17.030 --> 02:18.691
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE MUCH
OF A TEAM RIGHT NOW,

02:18.700 --> 02:21.351
AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO A
GUY WHO ISN'T EVEN ONE OF US.

02:36.030 --> 02:38.658
CONGREGATION: THIS LITTLE
LIGHT OF MINE

02:38.660 --> 02:41.300
I'M GONNA LET IT SHINE

02:41.300 --> 02:43.997
THIS LITTLE LIGHT OF MINE

02:44.000 --> 02:46.697
I'M GONNA LET IT SHINE

02:46.700 --> 02:49.499
THIS LITTLE LIGHT OF MINE

02:49.500 --> 02:51.150
I'M GONNA LET IT SHINE

02:51.160 --> 02:58.294
LET IT SHINE, LET IT SHINE,
LET IT SHINE

02:58.300 --> 03:00.155
ALL RIGHT,
THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.424
Y'ALL AIN'T GONNA
EMBARRASS ME ON SUNDAY.

03:03.630 --> 03:04.859
GET ON OUT OF HERE.

03:04.860 --> 03:06.259

03:14.260 --> 03:17.651
I'M ALL RIGHT.
GIVE ME SOME SUGAR.

03:17.660 --> 03:20.129
WHAT TIME YOU AND DAD PLAN
ON HEADING TO THE RETREAT?

03:20.130 --> 03:23.259
WHY, YOU TRYING TO HAVE
A HOUSE PARTY OR SOMETHING?

03:23.260 --> 03:25.149
I WAS AT LEAST GONNA
GIVE IT AN HOUR.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.356
DON'T YOU BREAK
MY GOOD STUFF.

03:27.360 --> 03:28.395
NEVER.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.528
WE'LL BE GONE AFTER
YOU GET OUT OF SCHOOL.

03:30.530 --> 03:31.656
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON.

03:31.660 --> 03:33.594
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
DON'T BE LATE.

03:33.600 --> 03:34.726
LOVE YOU.

TAMIA.

03:39.860 --> 03:42.955
NO BOYS AT THE HOUSE
AFTER WE'RE GONE.

03:44.060 --> 03:47.257
AT LEAST MAKE SURE
WE DON'T HEAR ABOUT IT.

03:47.260 --> 03:50.321
OK.

03:54.660 --> 03:57.789
OH, YEAH, THERE HE IS,
RIGHT THERE.

04:08.830 --> 04:10.855
HEY, MAN, WHAT'S UP?

04:10.860 --> 04:12.624
YOU MIND IF I SEE
YOUR PHONE?

04:12.630 --> 04:14.257
UM, THIS PHONE?

04:14.260 --> 04:15.989
YEAH.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.321
I DIDN'T CREATE THEM,
I SWEAR.

04:18.329 --> 04:20.149
IT JUST POPPED UP
IN MY GROUP CHAT,

04:20.160 --> 04:22.026
THEN OTHER PEOPLE
STARTED FORWARDING IT.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.419
YOU KNOW HOW THINGS GO VIRAL.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.420
HE JUST DROPPED IT.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.595
SPENCER, SPENCER,
SPENCER, SPENCER.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.250
WHOA. ONE FIGHT,

04:38.260 --> 04:40.319
PRINCIPAL LANDON KICKS YOU OUT.
COME ON, YOU KNOW THAT.

04:40.330 --> 04:41.889
SO I AIN'T SUPPOSED TO
STAND UP FOR MYSELF?

04:41.900 --> 04:43.720

04:43.730 --> 04:45.357

04:45.360 --> 04:47.192
AND I'M JUST SUPPOSED TO KEEP
TURNING THE OTHER CHEEK, HUH?

04:47.200 --> 04:48.793
NO, THEY'RE JUST
BEING THEM.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.120
OK, THEY DO THIS
TO EVERYONE WHEN

04:50.130 --> 04:51.598
THEY MESS UP A PLAY,
EVEN ME.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.852
IT'S NOT PERSONAL.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.089
NOT PERSONAL?

04:54.100 --> 04:56.751
THEY MADE A MEME
OUT OF ME FUMBLING A 40.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.250
BUT, YEAH, THAT'S
NOT PERSONAL.

04:58.260 --> 05:00.490
I GUESS YOU WOULD
SEE IT THAT WAY.

05:01.700 --> 05:03.555
THAT'S YOUR PEOPLE.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.694
HEY, ENOUGH, ENOUGH.

05:56.030 --> 06:00.490
BAKER: YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE A TEAM, A FAMILY!

06:00.500 --> 06:04.255
RIGHT NOW YOU ARE NOTHING
MORE THAN AN EMBARRASSMENT.

06:04.260 --> 06:06.399
Y'ALL FEEL LIKE
GIVING UP THIS SEASON?

06:06.400 --> 06:08.050
Y'ALL READY FOR THAT?
I'M NOT.

06:08.060 --> 06:11.690
AND I REFUSE TO LET YOU
GIVE UP ON YOUR FUTURES.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.158

06:14.160 --> 06:18.654
'CAUSE IF Y'ALL AIN'T
BONDED LIKE GLUE BY MONDAY,

06:18.660 --> 06:24.099
THIS LAST WEEK OF TWO-A-DAYS IS
GONNA FEEL LIKE A DAMN VACATION.

06:27.430 --> 06:29.194
DISGUSTED.

06:33.530 --> 06:34.656
COACH IS RIGHT.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.253

06:49.630 --> 06:50.825
HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?

06:50.830 --> 06:52.320

06:52.330 --> 06:54.094
IT'S FRIDAY. I'M GOING
BACK TO CRENSHAW.

06:57.260 --> 07:00.491
HEY, YOU'RE REALLY
BLOWING THIS OFF?

07:00.500 --> 07:02.150
YOU'RE REALLY NOT GONNA
SHOW UP FOR YOUR TEAM?

07:02.160 --> 07:03.821
MAN, I'VE BEEN
SHOWING UP,

07:03.830 --> 07:06.458

EVERY TEAM BEACH DAY.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.950
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT
FROM ME, DAWG?

07:07.960 --> 07:09.291
I WANT YOU TO WANT
TO BE HERE,

07:09.300 --> 07:11.621
TO WANT TO BE A PART
OF THIS TEAM.

07:11.630 --> 07:15.157
THAT'S MORE THAN JUST
GAMES AND PRACTICES.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.322
MAN, I JUST FOUGHT
MY BEST FRIEND FOR YOU.

07:17.330 --> 07:18.525
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO DEFEND ME.

07:18.530 --> 07:20.396
I DIDN'T ASK FOR
NONE OF THIS.

07:20.400 --> 07:23.552
THE WEEKENDS ARE THE ONLY
TIME I GET TO SEE MY FAMILY.

07:23.560 --> 07:26.689
YOU KNOW THIS BETTER
THAN ANYONE.

07:26.700 --> 07:31.024
SO Y'ALL CAN DO YOUR TEAM
WHATEVER WITHOUT ME.

07:31.030 --> 07:34.989
AFTER ALL, I AIN'T EVEN
ONE OF YOU, RIGHT?

07:35.000 --> 07:38.789
["RUN FOR YOUR LIFE"

07:43.460 --> 07:45.155

AS WELL GIVE UP NOW

07:45.160 --> 07:47.151
MY LIFE BEEN GOOD AND BAD

THE MORE I FOUND

07:49.430 --> 07:51.296

MYSELF TO DO

07:51.300 --> 07:53.792
NO MATTER THE PROBLEM,
REFUSE TO LOSE, SO

KIND OF LIKE
OLD TIMES, RIGHT?

08:06.830 --> 08:08.525
YEAH.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.124
SO WHY EXACTLY DID
MS. BENCH PUT US

08:11.130 --> 08:12.620
TOGETHER FOR
THE ENGLISH PROJECT?

08:12.630 --> 08:15.122
BEATS ME. WHEN I TRIED
TALKING TO HER ABOUT IT,

08:15.130 --> 08:17.827
SHE JUST SAID PARTNER
ASSIGNMENTS ARE FINAL.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.195
LUCKY US.

HEY, LET'S TRY AND MAKE
THE BEST OF IT.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.425
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S HOMEWORK,

08:23.430 --> 08:25.853
BUT WHO KNOWS,
MIGHT BE FUN.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.892
WHY IS THIS SO HARD?
IT'S ONE SIMPLE QUESTION--

08:29.900 --> 08:31.299
WHO WAS SHAKESPEARE?

08:31.300 --> 08:32.927
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
THERE'S, LIKE, A HUNDRED

08:32.929 --> 08:35.626
CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT
WHO THIS GUY REALLY WAS.

08:35.630 --> 08:38.793
WELL, NAME ASIDE, WHO HE WAS
COMES THROUGH IN HIS WORK,

08:38.799 --> 08:42.725
WHICH IS WHY I'M TRYING
TO FOCUS ON THAT, SO...

08:42.730 --> 08:43.856
LOOK, I KNOW I--

08:43.860 --> 08:45.749
ASHER: WHAT'S UP, LADIES?

08:45.760 --> 08:46.659
HEY, BABE.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.628
UH, WHAT ARE YOU
GUYS DOING HERE?

08:48.630 --> 08:51.156
<i>33 AND 1 ARE ALSO WORKING
ON THE ENGLISH THING,</i>

08:51.160 --> 08:53.925
SO I FIGURED 4 BRAINS
ARE BETTER THAN TWO.

08:53.930 --> 08:56.524
<i>331 UH, MAKE THAT
3 BRAINS.</i>

08:56.530 --> 08:58.225
THIS SHAKESPEARE DUDE'S
NOT REALLY MY THING.

08:58.230 --> 09:00.790
BUT, HEY, FOOD'S ON ME.

09:05.430 --> 09:06.829
COOP: SO WHAT, Y'ALL NEVER
MADE FUN OF EACH OTHER

09:06.830 --> 09:08.025
WHEN Y'ALL MESSED UP HERE?

09:08.030 --> 09:09.293
IT AIN'T JUST
THE WHACK MEMES

09:09.300 --> 09:10.859
OR THE HAZING.

09:10.860 --> 09:12.294
THEY DON'T ACCEPT ME.

09:12.300 --> 09:15.395
I MEAN, MAN, ACCEPTANCE
GO BOTH WAYS, THOUGH.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.289
YOU GOT TO BE HONEST. AIN'T

09:17.300 --> 09:18.893
YEAH, OK, IYANLA.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.390
MAN, SHUT UP.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.425
YOU KNOW THE FACT YOU
LECTURE ME ON HONESTY

09:22.430 --> 09:24.194
AND ACCEPTANCE IS
HILARIOUS, RIGHT?

09:24.200 --> 09:25.895
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

09:25.900 --> 09:28.551
YOU FINALLY BEEN HONEST WITH
YOUR PARENTS AND TOLD THEM YOU GAY?

09:28.560 --> 09:32.224
I MEAN, LISTEN, HAVE
THEY NOT MET ME?

09:32.230 --> 09:35.256
HOW CAN I BE ANYTHING ELSE?

09:35.260 --> 09:37.729
SERIOUSLY, I'M NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR BLINDNESS.

09:37.730 --> 09:40.051
BUT NICE TRY, THOUGH, BRO.
WE AIN'T DONE TALKING ABOUT YOU.

09:40.060 --> 09:42.051

DON'T REALIZE

09:54.500 --> 09:57.925

SOUTH CRENSHAW FOOTBALL RING?

09:57.930 --> 09:59.352
SERIOUSLY, MAN.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.089
AND IF IYANLA
WAS HERE,

10:01.100 --> 10:03.853
SHE'D PROBABLY TELL YOU,
"CHILD, LISTEN."

10:03.860 --> 10:06.249
DON'T YOU DARE.

10:06.260 --> 10:07.955
"CAN'T BE ACCEPTED
ON ONE TEAM

10:07.960 --> 10:09.394
TILL YOU LET GO
OF THE OTHER."

10:09.400 --> 10:11.255
MAN, I JUST CAME TO SEE
SOME OLD FRIENDS, OK?

10:11.260 --> 10:14.890
MM-HMM. AND PEEP
YOUR NEW REPLACEMENT.

10:14.900 --> 10:16.959
YEAH, MAYBE THAT, TOO.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.792
YEAH, I KNOW THAT, TOO.

10:18.800 --> 10:19.824
YOU AIN'T SLICK.

10:19.830 --> 10:21.298
I'M SLICKER THAN YOU.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.792
YOU SAW THAT, RIGHT?

10:23.800 --> 10:26.189
HEY, BOO.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.828
MAN, LOOK WHO BACK
SLUMMING IT IN THE 'HOOD.

10:28.830 --> 10:31.151
HEY, WHAT UP, FELLAS?
Y'ALL MISS ME?

10:31.160 --> 10:32.798
WHAT'S UP, BOY?

10:32.800 --> 10:34.620
HOW YOU DOING?
CHILLIN', CHILLIN'.

10:34.630 --> 10:36.325
HEY, YOU STILL COMING
TO MY MAMA'S COOKOUT LATER?

10:36.330 --> 10:37.559
SHE STILL MAKING HER
FAMOUS MAC AND CHEESE?

10:37.560 --> 10:39.699
ONLY RIGHT.
THEN HELL, YEAH.

10:39.700 --> 10:42.692
HEY, Y'ALL CALLED UP CAMERON
WILSON TO REPLACE ME, HUH?

10:42.700 --> 10:45.192
HEY, AT LEAST BROTHER'S WILLING
TO ROCK A SOUTH CRENSHAW JERSEY.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.895
OH, IT'S LIKE THAT?

10:46.900 --> 10:48.220
IT'S LIKE THAT, DAWG.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.255
ALL RIGHT. OK. OK.

10:50.260 --> 10:51.955
I'll CHECK YOU AT
THE COOKOUT, THOUGH.

10:51.960 --> 10:55.419
I BET.

10:55.430 --> 10:56.795
ALL RIGHT, I'M READY
TO CLEAN OUT THE SYSTEM

10:56.800 --> 10:59.519
AND THEN HIT ROUND TWO.
WHO WANTS MORE FOOD?

10:59.530 --> 11:02.727
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T NEED TO ANNOUNCE
EVERY TIME YOU NEED TO DROP A DEUCE.

11:02.730 --> 11:07.190
WHY DON'T I GET THE FOOD
AND YOU GO TAKE CARE OF THAT?

11:07.200 --> 11:09.259
DOES ANYONE WANT ANYTHING?

11:09.260 --> 11:10.853
NO, I'M GOOD.

11:10.860 --> 11:11.998
YEAH, I'll GET A DRINK.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.320
A PEACH AND GINGER
ICED TEA

11:13.330 --> 11:15.196
WITH TWO SPLASHES
OF SODA WATER.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.089
OF COURSE I REMEMBER
YOUR GO-TO.

11:17.100 --> 11:19.353
WHY WOULD I FORGET?

11:24.930 --> 11:27.024
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

11:27.030 --> 11:28.953
TRYING NOT TO FAIL ENGLISH?

11:28.960 --> 11:30.553
THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.824
I ALREADY AGREED TO KEEP
OUR STUPID HOOKUP A SECRET.

11:32.830 --> 11:36.824
OK, YOUR PERFECT BOYFRIEND
COVER STAYS INTACT. HAPPY?

11:38.500 --> 11:41.197
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
COVERING MY ASS.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.452
IT'S ABOUT NOT
DESTROYING THE LIVES

11:42.460 --> 11:44.258
OF THE 3 PEOPLE 1
CARE ABOUT THE MOST.

11:44.260 --> 11:45.819
LEILA WOULD BE DEVASTATED,

11:45.830 --> 11:47.753
AND JORDAN WOULD HATE ME
FOR INVOLVING YOU.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.956
AND LET ME GUESS,
THIRD PERSON'S YOU.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.257
ACTUALLY, IT'S YOU.

11:51.260 --> 11:53.592
I'M SERIOUS.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.455
YOU HAD A ROUGH RIDE
LAST YEAR,

11:55.460 --> 11:57.349
AND YOU'RE KIND OF REALLY
TURNING THINGS AROUND.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.454
I DON'T WANT TO MESS
THAT UP FOR YOU.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.649
SPENCER: YOU GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME.

12:12.930 --> 12:15.820
WHO IS THIS
EL DEBARGE

12:15.830 --> 12:17.025
JORDAN,

12:17.030 --> 12:18.896
WHAT YOU DOING HERE, MAN?

12:18.900 --> 12:20.299
THERE THEY ARE.

12:20.300 --> 12:21.722
LOOK LIKE HE
BASTARDIZING

12:21.730 --> 12:23.323
THEM POOR GREENS IS
WHAT IT LOOK LIKE.

12:23.330 --> 12:24.752
YOU NEVER BEEN IN
A KITCHEN BEFORE?

12:24.760 --> 12:27.058
JORDAN WAS SWEET ENOUGH
TO HELP ME OUT

12:27.060 --> 12:28.789
WHILE HE WAITED ON YOU.

12:28.800 --> 12:31.792
DILLON: I DON'T KNOW THAT "HELP"
WOULD BE THE WORD I WOULD USE.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.598
OK, EVERYBODY'S GOT
JOKES TODAY, HUH?

12:33.600 --> 12:35.557
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

12:35.560 --> 12:36.755
TO TALK ABOUT THE TEAM.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.296
NO, MAN, NOW IS NOT
A GOOD TIME.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.552
LOOK, WE DON'T STAND
A CHANCE THIS SEASON

12:39.560 --> 12:40.891
UNLESS WE ALL WORK
TOGETHER.

12:40.900 --> 12:42.322
OR DO YOU NOT CARE
ABOUT WINNING ANYMORE?

12:42.330 --> 12:43.820
LOOK, I'll PLAY,
I'll PRACTICE,

12:43.830 --> 12:45.525
AND I'll DAMN SURE DO
MY PART ON THE FIELD.

12:45.530 --> 12:47.191
BUT NOTHING MORE?
I CAME TO BEVERLY

12:47.200 --> 12:48.929
TO PLAY FOOTBALL,
NOT FORCE MYSELF

12:48.930 --> 12:52.093
INTO FAKE FRIENDSHIPS WITH FOLKS
WHO WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

12:52.100 --> 12:53.420
FAKE FRIENDSHIPS?

12:53.430 --> 12:54.693
I WELCOMED YOU INTO MY HOME.

12:54.700 --> 12:56.759
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
NO SHADE. YOU COOL.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.558
BUT IF WE'RE BEING HONEST,
YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING

12:58.560 --> 13:02.098
ABOUT ME, DAWG,
OR WHERE I'M FROM.

13:02.100 --> 13:05.195
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M HERE NOW.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.929
LET'S FIX THAT.

13:06.930 --> 13:07.920
NAH, NAH.

13:07.930 --> 13:09.955
LOOK, I GOT PLANS,
I GOT FRIENDS COMING OVER.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.452
I KNOW, YEAH, YOUR MOM ALREADY
SAID I COULD STAY FOR THE COOKOUT.

13:12.460 --> 13:15.555
AND YOU KNOW, SPENCE, I CAN'T
THINK OF A BETTER WAY TO REALLY

13:15.560 --> 13:17.324
GET TO KNOW YOU
AND CRENSHAW.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.525
HEY, JORDAN.

13:18.530 --> 13:21.124
JORDAN. JORDAN,

13:21.130 --> 13:22.996
JORDAN.

13:26.630 --> 13:29.019
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:30.860 --> 13:33.522
IT'S GONNA BE ONE
LONG-ASS DAY.

13:35.130 --> 13:40.296
["LIVING THE DREAM" BY TONY REDZ
AND MR. MAJOR PLAYING]

13:40.300 --> 13:41.051

13:41.060 --> 13:43.119

13:57.960 --> 13:59.359
BUT LET THE STORY UNFOLD

13:59.360 --> 14:02.000
I WAS A YOUNG CHUBBY...

14:02.000 --> 14:04.355

14:04.360 --> 14:08.820
I'M JUST TRYING TO ENJOY

I DIDN'T SAY NOTHING.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.223
WHAT'S UP,
BEVERLY HILLS?

14:23.530 --> 14:26.625

14:38.400 --> 14:39.959

14:39.960 --> 14:41.155
AND ON THAT NOTE,

14:41.160 --> 14:43.128
WE HAVE A LOT OF
WORK TO DO, SO...

14:43.130 --> 14:44.859
ALL RIGHT, WELL,

14:44.860 --> 14:46.350

DAD, NO.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.351
OH, WE'RE DOING
A SYMBOLIC PORTRAIT

14:48.360 --> 14:49.850

14:49.860 --> 14:51.589
SO USING PAINT, COLLAGE,

14:51.600 --> 14:54.626

14:54.630 --> 14:55.893
WOW. OK.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.220
HA. BACK IN MY DAY,

14:57.230 --> 14:58.891
WE JUST USED TO

BUT, UH, HAVE YOU SEEN
THE MOVIE "ANONYMOUS"?

15:03.360 --> 15:05.226
THE SHAKESPEARE
FRAUD MOVIE?

15:05.230 --> 15:06.550
THAT'S THE ONE.
YEAH, SO WHY DON'T

15:06.560 --> 15:08.221
YOU TAKE A BREAK
AND WATCH THAT?

15:08.230 --> 15:09.857
UH, YOU KNOW, YOU TWO
HAVE ALWAYS LOVED

15:09.860 --> 15:10.998
A GOOD MOVIE DAY.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.650
I'll MAKE THE POPCORN.

15:12.660 --> 15:14.697
COOL.

15:21.330 --> 15:23.298

15:23.300 --> 15:24.995
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU GUYS.
DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.229
SO WHY ARE

15:26.230 --> 15:27.550
'CAUSE I WANT TO KNOW
HOW TO PLAY.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.119
COOP: BOY, SHUT UP.
JUST SHOW ME.

15:29.130 --> 15:30.359
I GOT YOU.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.691
THIS IS LIKE NINES.
I DON'T KNOW.

15:31.700 --> 15:33.850
I DON'T GET IT.
I DON'T KNOW.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.619
OK.

15:37.630 --> 15:38.620
LOOK AT HIM.

15:38.630 --> 15:40.849
ABOUT TIME YOU JOINED US,
BABYFACE.

15:40.860 --> 15:42.692
IT'S JORDAN.

15:42.700 --> 15:43.758
IT'S JORDAN.

15:43.760 --> 15:46.559
LOOK AT YOU, STICKING
UP FOR YOURSELF.

15:46.560 --> 15:49.291
HEY, JORDAN.
I MIGHT LIKE YOU.

15:49.300 --> 15:51.553
WHERE YOU FROM,
JORDAN?

15:51.560 --> 15:53.528
OH, HE BEVERLY HILLS

15:53.530 --> 15:55.055

OH, YEAH?

15:57.130 --> 16:00.100
SHE'S, UH--I DON'T KNOW

16:00.100 --> 16:01.352
WE HAVEN'T BEEN BACK IN--

16:01.360 --> 16:03.897
UH-UH, YOU AIN'T
FROM AROUND HERE.

16:03.900 --> 16:05.299
HEY, IT'S YOUR LOSS.

16:05.300 --> 16:07.894
GOT A COUPLE OF SPECIAL
FOLKS AROUND HERE.

16:09.160 --> 16:10.491
AH, WHAT UP?

16:10.500 --> 16:12.150
BIG DAWG, HOW YOU DOING?
I'M GOOD.

16:12.160 --> 16:13.992
HOW YOU FEELING?

16:20.400 --> 16:22.892
HEY, Y'ALL GET SOME
CHAIRS, BE COMFORTABLE.

16:26.100 --> 16:27.693
STOP.

16:27.700 --> 16:30.089
DO YOU SERIOUSLY STILL CRY
AT THE END OF EVERY MOVIE?

16:30.100 --> 16:31.727
NO, MY CONTACTS ARE DRY.

16:31.730 --> 16:34.097
RIGHT. JUST LIKE
IT WAS YOUR CONTACTS

16:34.100 --> 16:35.659
WHEN WE SAW
"BLACK PANTHER,"

16:35.660 --> 16:38.493
"STEP UP," "STEP UP 2,"
"COCO."

16:38.500 --> 16:40.889
NO, YOU CRIED AT
"COCO," TOO.

16:42.100 --> 16:44.296
HEY, UM, REMEMBER
LAST FALL

16:44.300 --> 16:46.496
AT ANGEL'S POINT?

16:46.500 --> 16:49.151
ACTUALLY, LAST YEAR'S
KIND OF A BLUR FOR ME.

16:49.160 --> 16:50.594
NO, YOU REMEMBER.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.625
NO, NOT REALLY.
AT THE PARK--

16:52.630 --> 16:55.930
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD REALLY
GET BACK TO THE ENGLISH PROJECT.

16:58.800 --> 16:59.790
SERIOUSLY?

16:59.800 --> 17:02.360
SO I DON'T REMEMBER
EVERY LITTLE THING.

17:02.360 --> 17:04.351
I WAS HIGH A LOT
BACK THEN, OK?

17:04.359 --> 17:07.954
I'M KIND OF TRYING NOT TO
REMEMBER ALL THE CRAZY CRAP I DID.

17:10.930 --> 17:13.991
UM, WOW.,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.799
UH, I SHOULD GO.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.029
WHY?

17:18.030 --> 17:19.224
THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

17:19.230 --> 17:20.425
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER
ASKED MS. BENCH

17:20.430 --> 17:22.022
TO PUT US TOGETHER.

17:22.030 --> 17:23.794
YES, IT WAS ME.

17:23.800 --> 17:27.724
I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE IF WE
SPENT SOME TIME TOGETHER THAT...

17:27.730 --> 17:29.289
ANYWAY, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I THOUGHT.

17:29.300 --> 17:31.223
I DO NOT WANT TO FORCE
ANYONE INTO MY LIFE

17:31.230 --> 17:32.550
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE THERE.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.426
I'll JUST--T'LL
FINISH THIS ON MY OWN.

17:39.760 --> 17:43.390
HEY, MAN, YOU KNOW,
BRO, NAS IS TRASH.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.799
WHAT?
HOLD ON.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.450
NOW YOU'RE JUST
TROLLING, BRO.

17:46.460 --> 17:47.689
I MEAN, WHAT HE
EVEN BE SAYING?

17:47.700 --> 17:49.054
HE AIN'T SAYING NOTHING
REALLY THAT DEEP.

17:49.060 --> 17:50.494
ALL RIGHT, SO WHO GET
THE NUMBER-ONE SPOT--

17:50.500 --> 17:51.899
BIGGIE OR PAC?
CAMERON: BIGGIE, EASY.

17:51.900 --> 17:54.426
MAN, YOU ON
THE WRONG COAST, DAWG.

17:54.430 --> 17:56.592
STRAIGHT UP, MAN. PAC
WAS AN ACTIVIST, A POET.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.056
HE WASN'T A BETTER RAPPER.

17:58.060 --> 17:59.255
WHO HAD A BETTER FLOW?

17:59.260 --> 18:00.557
RAKIM.
HANDS DOWN.

18:00.560 --> 18:03.757
HE WAS A LYRICAL GENIUS,
CRAZY MIC TECHNIQUES,

18:03.760 --> 18:05.899
THE ORIGINAL SMOOTH FLOW.
COME ON, GUYS.

18:05.900 --> 18:09.450
"PAID IN FULL." NO ONE EVEN COMES
CLOSE TO TOUCHING THAT ALBUM.

18:09.460 --> 18:11.121
GREATEST OF ALL TIME.

18:11.130 --> 18:13.349
WHAT?!

18:13.360 --> 18:16.091
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

18:16.100 --> 18:17.727
YO, WHAT?

18:17.730 --> 18:18.925
WHOO! OK.

18:18.930 --> 18:20.056
OK, BABYFACE.

18:20.060 --> 18:21.391
DUDE'S TALKING ABOUT--

18:21.400 --> 18:23.129
LOOK AT CARLTON
DROPPING KNOWLEDGE, Y'ALL.

18:23.130 --> 18:25.098
WHO KNEW, MAN?

18:25.100 --> 18:26.295
YEAH, GIVE IT UP
FOR MY BOY!

18:26.300 --> 18:27.756
GIVE IT UP FOR MY BOY!

18:27.760 --> 18:29.899
WRONG! YOU KNOW DAMN WELL

21:14.500 --> 21:16.821

IF YOU CAN'T TAKE THE HEAT,
DON'T LIGHT THE FUSE

21:58.130 --> 22:00.121

23:16.400 --> 23:18.892

23:27.000 --> 23:28.490
JORDAN: WE'RE DOWN 7-14.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.491
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE THAT RING
UNLESS YOU USE THE TEAM.

23:30.500 --> 23:31.695
LET SOMEONE ELSE
PLAY DEFENSE.

23:31.700 --> 23:33.122
I GOT THIS.
I KNOW THEIR PLAYS.

23:33.130 --> 23:35.497
MAN, DIDN'T WE JUST
GO THROUGH THIS LAST WEEK?

23:35.500 --> 23:36.752
THE TEAM--
THIS AIN'T ABOUT Y'ALL.

23:36.760 --> 23:39.889
IT'S ABOUT ME AND THEM.
I GOT THIS.

24:25.700 --> 24:27.156
MAN: HEY, WHAT Y'ALL DOING?

24:27.160 --> 24:28.798
LET'S GO! LET'S GO.
COME ON.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.825
WHAT DO Y'ALL THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

24:33.400 --> 24:35.129
LET'S CUT THE FIELD LIGHTS.

24:35.130 --> 24:36.427
I GOT IT.

24:36.430 --> 24:40.355
GUARD: CHRIS, SPENCER.

24:40.360 --> 24:43.796
COME ON, MAN,
Y'ALL KNOW BETTER THAN THIS.

24:43.800 --> 24:46.258
DON'T MAKE ME CALL

24:46.260 --> 24:50.390
LOOK, MAN...

24:50.400 --> 24:52.755
LET'S JUST END THIS, OK?

24:52.760 --> 24:55.127
WE'RE FAMILY.

25:00.430 --> 25:02.592
YOU'RE A JOKE, MAN.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.160
YOU'RE A JOKE.

25:09.200 --> 25:12.750
ANICA: YOU SAY THAT
YOU'RE SCARED

25:12.760 --> 25:16.628
OF WHAT YOU SEE

25:16.630 --> 25:23.320
YOU SAY THAT I'VE
TORN YOUR HEART IN TWO...

25:23.330 --> 25:25.856
STALKER MUCH?

25:25.860 --> 25:27.259
IF YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE
KNOWING WHERE YOU ARE,

25:27.260 --> 25:30.355
MAYBE STOP INSTA-STORYING
YOUR AVOCADO TOAST.

25:31.560 --> 25:34.825
THEN WHY AREN'T YOU...

25:34.830 --> 25:36.924
SO I COULD START BY
LISTING A HUNDRED REASONS

25:36.930 --> 25:39.956
WHY I'VE BEEN SO CAUGHT UP
IN MY OWN DRAMA,

25:39.960 --> 25:42.452
OR WE CAN JUST JUMP
RIGHT TO THE PART

25:42.460 --> 25:44.895
WHERE I'M AN IDIOT.

25:44.900 --> 25:47.289
IT TOOK ME A MINUTE
TO REMEMBER

25:47.300 --> 25:50.759
THIS WEEKEND'S THE SECOND
ANNIVERSARY OF YOUR MOM'S PASSING.

25:50.760 --> 25:53.559
I'M REALLY SORRY.

25:53.560 --> 25:55.551
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

25:55.560 --> 25:58.359
AND OF COURSE I REMEMBER US
COMMEMORATING HER AT ELEVATION PARK. AND--

25:58.360 --> 26:00.499
I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU REMEMBERED,

26:00.500 --> 26:03.299
BUT I DON'T NEED
YOUR PITY.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.522
I'M FINE, SO YOU'RE
OFF THE HOOK.

26:06.530 --> 26:12.856
LET MY TIRED MIND
WANDER FREE...

26:12.860 --> 26:16.023
SO WHY HAVEN'T I SEEN YOU
WITH ANY GIRLS IN SCHOOL BEFORE?

26:16.030 --> 26:19.625
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER FELT THE NEED TO
PUT MY BUSINESS OUT THERE, THAT'S WHY.

26:19.630 --> 26:24.591
OK. OK, SO WHEN'S THE FIRST
TIME YOU SAID THE WORDS,

26:24.600 --> 26:26.159
IIIIM GAY,"
LIKE OUT LOUD?

26:26.160 --> 26:28.697
I NEVER HAD TO SAY IT.
I JUST AM.

26:28.700 --> 26:30.520
YOU NEVER SAID
THE WORDS?

26:30.530 --> 26:32.350
NO, IT'S JUST A WORD.

26:32.360 --> 26:34.920
I MEAN, IT'S OBVIOUS
I LIKE GIRLS.

26:34.930 --> 26:36.853
I'M NOT HIDING FROM IT.

26:36.860 --> 26:39.500
I'M NOT TRYING TO HIDE IT.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.594
I MEAN, I LIKE YOU.

26:41.600 --> 26:42.795
YEAH?

26:42.800 --> 26:44.325
YEAH.

26:44.330 --> 26:45.889
I DON'T KNOW,
SOMETHING TELLS ME

26:45.900 --> 26:47.720
YOU'RE FULL
OF SURPRISES, THOUGH.

26:49.330 --> 26:52.322
WHAT, YOU GOT PLANS
OR DOWN TO HANG?

26:52.330 --> 26:55.595
I MEAN, IT'S COOL. YOU CAN
COME INSIDE, CHILL, KICK IT.

26:55.600 --> 26:58.058
WHATEVER.

26:58.060 --> 27:01.826
YEAH. YEAH, I'M
DEFINITELY DOWN TO HANG.

27:01.830 --> 27:03.628
OR WHATEVER.

27:03.630 --> 27:05.849
HA HA HA HA!

27:06.930 --> 27:11.857
AHH, AHH

27:13.330 --> 27:16.721
LISTEN, MAN, I KNOW THINGS
GOT A LITTLE INTENSE BACK THERE,

27:16.730 --> 27:19.358
BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE, YOUR
TEAM SHOWED UP FOR YOU.

27:19.360 --> 27:21.590
EVEN WITH ALL OF OUR
INTERNAL BS, THEY SHOWED UP.

27:21.600 --> 27:22.795
THAT HAS TO FEEL GOOD.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.029
THEY SHOWED UP FOR YOU

27:24.030 --> 27:25.225
AND TO STICK IT
TO SOUTH CRENSHAW.

27:25.230 --> 27:27.221
ISN'T THAT WHAT
YOU WERE DOING?

27:27.230 --> 27:28.925
ONLY BECAUSE YOU PUT US
IN THAT SITUATION.

27:28.930 --> 27:30.523
WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER
PLAYED THAT GAME.

27:30.530 --> 27:34.296
NOW MY OLD TEAMMATES
WON'T EVEN TALK TO ME.

27:34.300 --> 27:36.655
WHY YOU HAVE TO COME
HERE, MAN?

27:36.660 --> 27:38.025
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

27:38.030 --> 27:41.000
I SHOWED UP IN YOUR WORLD
AND BLEW EVERYTHING UP?

27:41.000 --> 27:43.651
SOUNDS FAMILIAR,
DOESN'T IT?

27:47.560 --> 27:48.755

REGISTRATION, PLEASE?

28:02.500 --> 28:05.060
WHY? I WASN'T
SPEEDING OR ANYTHING.

28:05.060 --> 28:07.028
YOU MADE AN ILLEGAL
TURN AT A RED LIGHT.

28:07.030 --> 28:08.691
LICENSE AND REGISTRATION.

28:08.700 --> 28:10.452

HEY, JUST KEEP LOOKING
AT ME, ALL RIGHT?

29:11.100 --> 29:13.250
JUST KEEP LOOKING AT ME.

29:15.860 --> 29:18.625
I HAVE OFFICER TRISHELL'S
BADGE NUMBER ALREADY.

29:18.630 --> 29:21.452
I WANT TO SPEAK
TO HIS SUPERVISING OFFICER.

29:21.460 --> 29:22.928
WELL, HE CAN TALK TO ME
NOW OR HE CAN FACE ME

29:22.930 --> 29:25.092
IN THE MORNING WHEN
I FILE A LAWSUIT

29:25.100 --> 29:27.091
AGAINST HIS ENTIRE
DEPARTMENT.

29:27.100 --> 29:29.455
ARE YOU GUYS OK?

29:32.430 --> 29:35.195
JORDAN: HOW COULD YOU NOT
GO OFF ON THAT COP?

29:35.200 --> 29:37.123
WHY DIDN'T YOU
HAVE MY BACK?

29:37.130 --> 29:39.121
I HAD YOUR BACK.

29:39.130 --> 29:41.849
I GOT YOU HOME.

29:43.860 --> 29:46.921
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN ARGUE
WITH A COP IN THE FIRST PLACE?

29:46.930 --> 29:49.592
WHY WOULD YOU PUT YOURSELF
IN THAT KIND OF DANGER?

29:49.600 --> 29:51.659
I DID WHAT I WAS TAUGHT.

29:51.660 --> 29:55.051
I WAS STANDING UP FOR
MYSELF, OK, DAD?

29:58.060 --> 29:59.824
I'll CHECK ON HIM.

30:07.630 --> 30:09.120
YO, CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING?

30:09.130 --> 30:10.325
MM-HMM.

30:10.330 --> 30:11.593
WHY YOU AIN'T NEVER
TALKED TO JORDAN

30:11.600 --> 30:13.329
ABOUT DEALING WITH
THE POLICE?

30:13.330 --> 30:16.493
BY THE TIME I WAS 8,
MY MOMS MADE IT CLEAR.

30:16.500 --> 30:19.492
COPS LIKE THAT, THEY SEE
MY BLACKNESS AS A WEAPON,

30:19.500 --> 30:22.219
YOU KNOW, SO YOU TALK SLOW,

30:22.230 --> 30:26.019
YOU DO AS THEY ASK,
YOU KEEP YOUR HANDS VISIBLE,

30:26.030 --> 30:27.657
AND YOU NEVER RUN.

30:27.660 --> 30:31.551
HOW COME YOU AIN'T
TELL HIM THAT?

30:31.560 --> 30:35.053
I GUESS I THOUGHT
I HAD TIME.

30:35.060 --> 30:38.325
I FOUGHT SO HARD TO
GET UP OUT THE 'HOOD.

30:38.330 --> 30:42.494
I HONESTLY THOUGHT
THAT WITH ALL THIS...

30:42.500 --> 30:46.596
I HONESTLY THOUGHT
THAT I HAD BOUGHT JORDAN

30:46.600 --> 30:49.251
JUST A LITTLE BIT
MORE TIME BEFORE...

30:49.260 --> 30:52.298
HE HAD TO FACE THE...

30:52.300 --> 30:56.624
THE UGLY SIDE OF BEING
A BLACK MAN IN AMERICA.

30:59.430 --> 31:02.092
CAN'T NOBODY SHELTER
HIS SON FROM IT.

31:03.230 --> 31:05.119
MM-MMM.

31:21.260 --> 31:24.457
UM, WHY ARE YOU
WASTING YOUR TIME

31:24.460 --> 31:26.792
IN THESE MESSY-ASS HALLWAYS
OF SOUTH CRENSHAW

31:26.800 --> 31:28.723
WHEN YOU COULD BE,
I DON'T KNOW,

31:28.730 --> 31:31.529
GIVING DRAKE A RUN
FOR HIS MONEY?

31:31.530 --> 31:33.555
IT'S WHATEVER.
I DON'T KNOW.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.028
ARE YOU BLUSHING?

31:35.030 --> 31:36.953
WHAT, IS THE TAMIA COOPER
BLUSHING RIGHT NOW?

31:36.960 --> 31:39.895
YOU TRIPPIN', GIRL. YOU KNOW
BLACK PEOPLE DON'T BLUSH.

31:39.900 --> 31:43.598
SO, JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE
IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

31:46.230 --> 31:48.198
MM-HMM.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.419
DEFINITELY WARM.,

31:50.430 --> 31:52.797
DEFINITELY BLUSHING.

31:58.530 --> 32:00.259
CLASSIK: ARE YOU MINE?

32:00.260 --> 32:03.457
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO WASTE NO TIME

32:03.460 --> 32:04.689
I CAN'T DENY

32:04.700 --> 32:06.327
I'll SHOW YOU LOVE

32:06.330 --> 32:09.254
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT YOU DON'T MIND

32:09.260 --> 32:10.694
AFTER ALL THIS TIME...

32:10.700 --> 32:12.395
SO ARE YOU GONNA
PLAY ME ANOTHER SONG?

32:12.400 --> 32:15.256
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT YOU DON'T MIND...

32:15.260 --> 32:17.399
HELL, YEAH.

32:17.400 --> 32:18.595
I AM YOURS

32:18.600 --> 32:21.991
LEAD THE WAY
LIKE MARTIANS

32:22.000 --> 32:23.456
LET'S CHANGE THE GAME

32:23.460 --> 32:24.655
I AM YOURS

32:24.660 --> 32:28.198
THROUGH RAIN AND SNOW

32:33.600 --> 32:35.295
PATIENCE, COME ON.

32:35.300 --> 32:36.620
YOU GOT TO GET UP.
WAKE UP.

32:36.630 --> 32:38.029
OK, JUST GIVE ME
ONE SECOND.

32:38.030 --> 32:40.089
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE
A SECOND.

32:43.230 --> 32:45.927
OH, HEY, PATIENCE.

32:45.930 --> 32:47.250
HI.

32:47.260 --> 32:48.455
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GET HOME

32:48.460 --> 32:49.928
BEFORE YOUR MOM
GETS WORRIED.

32:49.930 --> 32:51.193
YES, MA'AM.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.292
GOOD MORNING, TAMIA.

32:52.300 --> 32:53.893
BREAKFAST IN 10.

32:53.900 --> 32:55.220
OK.

33:02.200 --> 33:06.194
SO YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHY
YOU HAD ME CALL EVERYONE HERE?

33:09.160 --> 33:11.049
LOOK, MAN, I'M SORRY
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

33:11.060 --> 33:13.051
IT'S KIND OF MESSED UP
IT TOOK BEING FACE DOWN

33:13.060 --> 33:15.859
WITH YOU IN THE CONCRETE
TO REALIZE...

33:15.860 --> 33:17.589
WE AIN'T ALL THAT DIFFERENT.

33:17.600 --> 33:18.852
AND I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
REALIZED THAT SOONER

33:18.860 --> 33:20.521
IF I HADN'T BEEN
PUSHING Y'ALL AWAY.

33:20.530 --> 33:23.955
ASHER: WHAT'S WITH
THE IMPROMPTU MEET

33:23.960 --> 33:26.600
SPENCER'S GOT
SOMETHING TO SAY.

33:26.600 --> 33:27.920
HEY, THANK Y'ALL
FOR SHOWING UP.

33:27.930 --> 33:29.420
AND I DON'T MEAN
JUST THIS MORNING,

33:29.430 --> 33:30.852
I MEAN YESTERDAY, TOO.

33:30.860 --> 33:32.851
HEY, YO, MY LAST TEAM,
WE WERE LIKE A FAMILY,

33:32.860 --> 33:35.329
AND I JUST ASSUMED Y'ALL
WEREN'T DRIVEN BY THAT SAME BOND,

33:35.330 --> 33:36.650
AND THAT'S MY BAD.

33:36.660 --> 33:38.150
BUT Y'ALL TURNING
UP FOR ME YESTERDAY

33:38.160 --> 33:39.650
SHOWED ME WHAT KIND OF
TEAM Y'ALL REALLY ARE,

33:39.660 --> 33:41.025
AND I WANT IN ON THAT.

33:41.030 --> 33:43.397
CRENSHAW WILL ALWAYS BE
A PART OF WHO I AM,

33:43.400 --> 33:44.856
BUT BEING A BEVERLY EAGLE,

33:44.860 --> 33:47.352
THAT'S A PART OF
WHO I'M BECOMING.

33:47.360 --> 33:49.499
AND LOOK, MAN, I KNOW
I LOST LAST WEEK'S GAME.

33:49.500 --> 33:52.629
NO, YOU DIDN'T. I THREW
INTERCEPTION THIRD QUARTER.

33:52.630 --> 33:54.724
YOU DIDN'T LOSE
THAT GAME ALONE.

33:54.730 --> 33:56.721
MISSED TACKLE,
SECOND QUARTER.

33:56.730 --> 33:59.700
PASS INTERFERENCE,
FOURTH QUARTER.

33:59.700 --> 34:02.590
CLOUDED JUDGMENT.

34:02.600 --> 34:05.023
UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS.

34:05.030 --> 34:06.589
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
PLAY LAST WEEK.

34:06.600 --> 34:08.193
THAT'S WHAT KEPT ME
FROM PLAYING.

34:08.199 --> 34:12.853
I LOST US THE GAME BEFORE
YOU EVEN STEPPED ON THE FIELD.

34:14.530 --> 34:16.225
ALL RIGHT, LET'S
BREAK IT DOWN, BOYS.

34:16.230 --> 34:18.652
GET IN HERE.

34:19.659 --> 34:22.129
EAGLES ON THREE.
1,2, 3.

34:22.130 --> 34:23.495
ALL: EAGLES!

34:23.500 --> 34:25.889
JORDAN: ALL RIGHT.

34:34.060 --> 34:37.121
COOP: NO, SERIOUSLY, DILLON
BEAT HIM AT DOMINOES AGAIN.

34:37.130 --> 34:39.292
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN MR. ROUNDTREE'S
FACE. I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA--

34:39.300 --> 34:44.123
I DON'T WANT YOU HANGING AROUND
THAT PATIENCE GIRL ANYMORE.

34:44.130 --> 34:46.553
THERE'S BEEN RUMBLINGS
IN THE CHURCH.

34:46.560 --> 34:48.949
SHE'S TROUBLE.

34:53.429 --> 34:56.400
SO...

34:56.400 --> 35:00.223
YOU THINK PATIENCE IS
TROUBLE BECAUSE SHE'S GAY?

35:00.230 --> 35:05.327
BECAUSE THAT WOULD MAKE ME
TROUBLE SINCE...

35:08.760 --> 35:10.956
SINCE I'M GAY, TOO.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.691
YOU'RE NOT GAY.

35:13.700 --> 35:15.156
YOU'RE CONFUSED.

35:15.160 --> 35:19.097
AND IT'S GIRLS LIKE PATIENCE
THAT ARE CONFUSING YOU.

35:24.660 --> 35:30.224
MOM, LOOK AT ME,
PLEASE.

35:30.230 --> 35:33.723
I AM GAY.

35:33.730 --> 35:37.394
AND THERE IS NO AMOUNT OF
PRAYER THAT'S GONNA CHANGE THAT.

35:37.400 --> 35:39.858
TRUST ME, I'VE TRIED.

35:41.630 --> 35:44.600
I LOVE YOU, TAMIA.

35:44.600 --> 35:48.992
YOUR FATHER AND I WORKED
HARD TO RAISE YOU RIGHT.

35:50.930 --> 35:55.925
BUT I'M SORRY. ...
I CAN'T CONDONE THIS.

35:58.030 --> 36:01.022
SO IF YOU CANNOT ABIDE
BY OUR RULES,

36:01.030 --> 36:04.250
YOU CANNOT LIVE
IN THIS HOUSE.

36:14.430 --> 36:19.425
WELL, THEN I GUESS...
I DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

36:39.400 --> 36:41.095
HEY, WHAT UP?

36:44.660 --> 36:46.389
I THOUGHT I MADE
MYSELF CLEAR

36:46.400 --> 36:48.129
THAT YOU AIN'T WELCOME
HERE NO MORE.

36:48.130 --> 36:52.328
YOUR BOY, CAMERON,
HE QUICK ON HIS FEET,

36:52.330 --> 36:55.220
BUT HE TELEGRAPHS WHERE
HE GONNA GO WITH HIS EYES.

36:55.230 --> 36:56.322
EVERY PLAY.

36:56.330 --> 36:58.059
YOU GET HIM TO STOP
DOING THAT,

36:58.060 --> 37:00.529
YOU GOT A STRAIGHT LINE
TO THE PLAYOFFS.

37:02.460 --> 37:04.554
HEY, YO.

37:04.560 --> 37:07.029
WHY YOU HELPING US?

37:08.800 --> 37:10.950
'CAUSE NO MATTER
WHAT YOU SAY,

37:10.960 --> 37:13.099
THIS IS MY COMMUNITY,

37:13.100 --> 37:17.298
THIS IS MY FAMILY,
AND THIS IS WHO I AM.

37:17.300 --> 37:20.850
ME PLAYING FOR BEVERLY
AIN'T GONNA CHANGE THAT.

37:20.860 --> 37:25.297
FAMILY, WE HELP
EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

37:25.300 --> 37:29.123
PLUS, I WANT TO PLAY THE BEST
VERSION OF Y'ALL IN THE PLAYOFFS.

37:33.760 --> 37:35.649
BAKER: JORDAN,
I NEED FOR YOU TO KNOW

37:35.660 --> 37:39.699
THAT NONE OF WHAT HAPPENED
YESTERDAY IS YOUR FAULT.

37:39.700 --> 37:41.520
YESTERDAY YOU SAID--

37:41.530 --> 37:42.998
I KNOW WHAT I SAID.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.493
UM, I WAS SCARED.
I WAS ANGRY,

37:46.500 --> 37:47.695
AND I WAS WRONG.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.190
YOUR MOTHER AND I,
WE SHOULD HAVE HAD

37:49.200 --> 37:51.350
A TALK WITH YOU
A LONG TIME AGO

37:51.360 --> 37:54.352
ABOUT THE REALITY
OF FACING THE POLICE,

37:54.360 --> 37:57.625
AND THAT'S ON ME.
THAT'S MY BAD.

37:57.630 --> 37:58.893
SEE, I'M GONNA
FIX THAT TODAY,

37:58.900 --> 38:01.460
BECAUSE THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING TO US

38:01.460 --> 38:05.021
IS KEEPING YOU
AND YOUR SISTER ALIVE.

38:07.630 --> 38:09.257
IF I LOOKED LIKE SPENCER,

38:09.260 --> 38:11.900
WOULD YOU HAVE HAD
THE TALK WITH ME EARLIER?

38:13.460 --> 38:15.053
PROBABLY.

38:15.060 --> 38:18.098
YEAH, I--I THINK
I WOULD.

38:18.100 --> 38:20.228
WHY HAVE YOU NEVER
TAKEN ME TO CRENSHAW, DAD?

38:20.230 --> 38:22.426
WE LIVE 30 MINUTES AWAY
FROM WHERE YOU GREW UP,

38:22.430 --> 38:26.754
AND THE FIRST TIME I SPENT ANY
REAL TIME THERE WAS YESTERDAY.

38:26.760 --> 38:28.353
ARE YOU ASHAMED OF ME?
IS THAT IT?

38:28.360 --> 38:32.058
JORDAN, OF COURSE I'M NOT
ASHAMED OF YOU. I LOVE YOU.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.791
NOW, I DON'T SPEND TIME
IN CRENSHAW, BUT THAT--

38:34.800 --> 38:36.791
THAT HAS MORE TO DO
WITH--WITH MY PAST.

38:36.800 --> 38:38.552
BUT, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE RIGHT,

38:38.560 --> 38:41.655
I SHOULDN'T KEEP YOU
SEPARATED FROM ANY PART

38:41.660 --> 38:43.890
OF WHO YOU ARE.

38:43.900 --> 38:47.450
AND I HAVE AN IDEA OF
A GOOD PLACE TO START.

38:47.460 --> 38:49.690
["COLD WAR" BY
CAUTIOUS CLAY PLAYING]

38:49.700 --> 38:53.989
YELLOW-TINTED LENSES
AND A PINK GELATO

38:55.730 --> 39:00.600
FALLING OUT THE WINDOW,
HIT ME BACK TOMORROW

39:00.600 --> 39:06.528
WE'LL ALWAYS BE THE ONE
TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW

39:08.300 --> 39:12.589
'CAUSE WE AIMING FOR THE STARS
WITH A POINT AND HOLLOW

39:14.500 --> 39:19.927
FEELING THESE SONGS,
MOCKING JOKES AND CAROLS

39:21.300 --> 39:26.420
STARTED THIS JOB SELLING
ROCKS AND ARROWS

39:26.430 --> 39:29.559
'CAUSE THEY ONLY SWIPE RIGHT
IF YOU ... FOR FOLLOWS

39:32.530 --> 39:36.751
WELCOME TO THE DAYS
OF THE BROKE AND SHALLOW...

39:36.760 --> 39:38.228
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO GO.

39:38.230 --> 39:44.090
BUT IF WE JUST SPOKE
LIKE WE MEANT IT

39:44.100 --> 39:47.229
WOULD YOU REFERENCE

39:47.230 --> 39:50.200
THIS OPEN PART OF ME?

39:50.200 --> 39:56.719
THE MINUTE I KNOW,
THE TIME WE SPENT IN

39:56.730 --> 39:59.893
CAME CORRECTED

39:59.900 --> 40:03.450
IN MY ANATOMY

40:09.230 --> 40:11.449
MAN: HERE IT COMES.
HERE IT COMES.

40:11.460 --> 40:13.724
AND HER GRANDDAUGHTER
STRAIGHT UP TOOK ALL HER MONEY.

40:13.730 --> 40:14.925
I TOLD YOU.
I TOLD YOU.

40:14.930 --> 40:16.420
HEH HEH! I TRIED TO TELL HER.

40:16.430 --> 40:19.354
I'M SURE YOU DID. AND THERE'S
NO HELPING SOME PEOPLE.

40:19.360 --> 40:21.499
BARBER: HA HA! YEAH.
BOY.

40:21.500 --> 40:22.990
THERE YOU GO, SON.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.320
THANKS.

40:24.330 --> 40:25.820
GOT HIM LOOKING SHARP.

40:25.830 --> 40:27.252
BARBER:
LOOKING REAL GOOD.

40:27.260 --> 40:29.194
YEAH, IT'S GOOD TO SEE
YOUR OLD MAN AGAIN.

40:29.200 --> 40:30.895
YEAH, IT BEEN A WHILE.

40:30.900 --> 40:32.390
YES, SIR.
OOH-WEE.

40:32.400 --> 40:33.925
THAT BOY JUST LOVED
GETTING IN TROUBLE.

40:33.930 --> 40:35.557
OK, EASY.
YEAH.

40:35.560 --> 40:37.255
HE EVER TELL YOU
THOSE STORIES? NO, SIR.

40:37.260 --> 40:38.955
GO ON.
BAKER: HERE WE GO.

40:38.960 --> 40:40.951
YEAH, HE WAS
THE RAW MAN BACK THEN.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.122
FOOTBALL PLAYER.
YEAH, HE WAS SOMETHING.

40:43.130 --> 40:45.451
YEAH, HE WAS LIKE
THE TASMANIAN DEVIL.

40:45.460 --> 40:47.827
BAKER: WHAT YOU
LOOKING AT? HEH HEH HEH!

40:47.830 --> 40:51.255
AND IT WASN'T TILL HE
STARTED DATING GRACE JAMES--

40:51.260 --> 40:54.195
ACTUALLY, IT WAS
GRACE HARPER BACK THEN.

40:54.200 --> 40:56.760
YEAH. ANYWAY, THAT'S WHAT
FINALLY SETTLED HIM DOWN.

40:56.760 --> 41:00.390
MY DAD AND--MY DAD AND
GRACE JAMES? OH, YEAH.

41:02.360 --> 41:03.998
THAT'S THEM RIGHT THERE.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.321
YEAH, AS INSEPARABLE AS THEY
WERE ALL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL,

41:06.330 --> 41:08.890
I JUST KNEW THEY WERE
GONNA END UP MARRIED.

41:08.900 --> 41:11.198
YEAH, BUT I GUESS
I WAS WAY OFF.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.089
FUNNY HOW THINGS HAVE
A WAY OF WORKING OUT,

41:13.100 --> 41:15.319
HER SON LIVING
WITH YOU GUYS AND ALL.

41:15.330 --> 41:18.550
YEAH, THAT'S THEM.

41:18.560 --> 41:20.494
MM-HMM.
