WEBVTT

00:01.230 --> 00:04.029
- Previously on Being Human...
- I lost my ring.

00:04.070 --> 00:06.038
- Where the hell is it?
- Ah!

00:06.070 --> 00:07.936
Danny killed me.

00:07.970 --> 00:10.234
- Are you messing with me?

00:10.270 --> 00:13.729
- Bridge. I wanna
shake his very existence.

00:13.780 --> 00:15.737
- Unh!
- There's an order now.

00:15.780 --> 00:17.669
There's Bishop
and there's me.

00:17.710 --> 00:21.169
- What's it gonna be?
Us or them?

00:21.220 --> 00:22.312
- I choose them.

00:22.350 --> 00:25.183
(Screaming)

00:25.220 --> 00:27.257
- I told Mom and Dad I saw you.
- What did you tell them?

00:27.290 --> 00:28.610
- My sweet brother
went mad.

00:28.660 --> 00:30.856
(Grunting)

00:32.430 --> 00:34.558
- Can I help you
with that?

00:34.600 --> 00:36.022
- Josh.

00:36.900 --> 00:38.368
- Oh my God!
- Oh no!

00:42.640 --> 00:46.201
** If you're gonna lie *

00:46.240 --> 00:49.403
- (Sally): There's a reason
monsters hide under the bed.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.145
* I'll take you back home... **

00:51.180 --> 00:54.844
We're more scared of you
than you are of us.

00:54.880 --> 01:00.216
That look on your face, that scream on
your lips when you eventually see us...

01:03.460 --> 01:05.053
...it's enough
to make us forget

01:05.090 --> 01:06.694
we were ever
humans at all.

01:06.730 --> 01:11.065
- She has a pretty bad
gash on her head...

01:11.100 --> 01:13.194
some bumps and bruises.

01:14.140 --> 01:18.668
And, um, where
exactly were you?

01:18.710 --> 01:21.930
- I am going to
find who did this.

01:21.980 --> 01:24.347
- And what? Kill them?

01:24.380 --> 01:25.939
She was drunk, Aidan.

01:25.980 --> 01:28.312
Some guy came on to her
in an alley.

01:28.350 --> 01:29.647
She probably
pissed him off.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.317
And he was
probably drunk,

01:31.350 --> 01:35.514
which is why
I asked you to watch her.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.654
So...

01:37.690 --> 01:40.853
just don't do anything.

01:41.900 --> 01:46.269
- Josh, I--I'm sorry.

01:48.100 --> 01:52.003
- (Woman on PA): Phone call
please, Dr. Roberts. Phone call please.

01:52.040 --> 01:55.772
- What did Emily say about
the man who attacked her?

01:55.810 --> 01:58.973
- What? I don't know.
- What did he look like?

01:59.010 --> 02:01.547
- I don't know.
He offered her a light.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.719
- That's it?
That's all he said?

02:03.750 --> 02:05.013
- He gave her some
fake creeper name.

02:05.050 --> 02:07.189
Marcus, Michael,
I don't know.

02:07.220 --> 02:08.358
(Sighing)

02:08.389 --> 02:11.030
- (Whispering): Marcus?
He said "Marcus?"

02:16.800 --> 02:18.791
(Man on CB, indistinct)

02:18.830 --> 02:20.366
I never thought

02:20.400 --> 02:22.835
you would stoop to this,
cleaning up Marcus' mess.

02:22.870 --> 02:24.531
- Marcus' mess?

02:24.570 --> 02:26.675
- He needs to be punished.
- For what?

02:26.710 --> 02:28.735
Your roommate coldcocking
him in an alley

02:28.780 --> 02:31.579
or the fact you started doggy
daycare in the first place?

02:31.610 --> 02:33.339
- Marcus beats up
19-year-old girls.

02:33.380 --> 02:35.246
That's the program
you're running now?

02:35.280 --> 02:37.942
- It's a little bit different
since the last time I saw you.

02:37.990 --> 02:40.311
- It is out of control,
even for you.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.523
- Oh, I'm in control. You're
the one who's slipping, Aidan.

02:43.560 --> 02:47.497
Marcus was provoked by
a lesser being. He retaliated.

02:47.530 --> 02:49.760
Time was, you would've
done the same thing.

02:49.800 --> 02:50.870
You know we arrested
somebody last week

02:50.900 --> 02:53.130
whose pit bull
killed a little girl?

02:53.170 --> 02:55.559
You let your dog
run wild, Aidan.

02:55.600 --> 02:58.399
The rest is justice.

03:05.780 --> 03:07.544
- You and Emily
need to get out of town.

03:07.580 --> 03:08.570
- What? Why?

03:08.620 --> 03:10.088
- Because you can't
be a werewolf

03:10.120 --> 03:11.645
and tear up a vampire
on their own turf.

03:11.690 --> 03:14.751
Do you know what you've brought
on yourself, on our household?

03:14.790 --> 03:16.952
- Wait. What?
- Marcus.

03:16.990 --> 03:19.220
Mm-hmm, yeah. Josh,
the one who jumped Emily,

03:19.260 --> 03:21.297
he is a vampire and
he is one of the worst.

03:21.330 --> 03:22.422
- How do you
know that?

03:22.470 --> 03:24.461
- That cop you talked to...
I tried to tell you.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.730
Josh, there is an order
to things, and Bishop...

03:26.770 --> 03:30.263
- He's a vampire too? God, Aidan!
- Shut up! Shut up!

03:30.310 --> 03:33.905
You and Emily,
you need to leave town.

03:33.940 --> 03:37.899
(Sighing)
And I need to fix this.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.315
- (Sally): It's that
shred of humanity

03:41.350 --> 03:43.614
that makes us eventually
crawl out from under the stairs

03:43.650 --> 03:45.288
and show ourselves to you.

03:45.320 --> 03:48.950
Because even a monster can
be afraid of the darkness.

04:04.270 --> 04:05.760
Bridget.

04:09.280 --> 04:12.716
Bridge. I'm here.

04:15.050 --> 04:16.983
Can you hear me?

04:20.160 --> 04:23.653
I know what he's doing
to you. You're not alone.

04:25.460 --> 04:27.224
Bridget.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.892
Come on,
just hear me out.

04:29.930 --> 04:30.920
(* Rock *)

04:30.970 --> 04:33.632
Really, you can't
hear me?

04:33.670 --> 04:37.038
I'm a ghost. I transcend pseudohippie rock.
- Leave me alone!

04:37.070 --> 04:39.778
Do you hear me?

04:39.810 --> 04:41.369
Get out of this house.

04:41.410 --> 04:42.809
Get out of my head.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.978
Just leave me
the hell alone!

04:45.010 --> 04:46.876
- Hey.

04:50.950 --> 04:54.511
- I'm not going anywhere.
I'm fine.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.426
I'm not even
on the good painkillers.

04:56.460 --> 04:57.552
- We're going
to the house,

04:57.590 --> 04:59.058
we're getting your things
and we're going.

04:59.090 --> 05:02.219
- Where?
- We'll figure it out.

05:02.260 --> 05:07.232
It's not safe here, Em.
That... guy who jumped you...

05:07.270 --> 05:08.999
he's still out there.

05:09.040 --> 05:12.499
- Oh God! He was some douche
I jock-walked, OK?

05:12.540 --> 05:13.530
He's not a mass murderer.

05:13.580 --> 05:17.539
- Em, just... please.

05:18.350 --> 05:20.273
- Only if you
take me one place.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.743
- Yes, of course.
Anywhere.

05:33.830 --> 05:36.561
(Horns honking in distance)

05:36.600 --> 05:39.069
(Siren wailing in distance)

05:40.070 --> 05:41.469
- Hiya.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.470
- What's going on? I know
we haven't had a chance--

05:44.510 --> 05:46.535
- I think Danny's hurting
Bridget and he's a psycho.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.378
I went over there
to tell her that

05:48.410 --> 05:49.571
and she told me
to screw off.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.806
I feel horrible 'cause
I gave her the blessing

05:51.850 --> 05:53.340
to be with him
in the first place.

05:53.380 --> 05:56.020
- You didn't know that
he was a psycho, so...

05:56.050 --> 05:57.586
- I didn't
subconsciously know?

05:57.620 --> 06:00.180
I didn't deliberately trick
Bridget into dating him

06:00.220 --> 06:02.109
because I'm really
a vengeful ghost

06:02.160 --> 06:03.889
and I wanted her
to suffer like me?

06:03.930 --> 06:06.353
- No!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.357
Yeah, no,
you're a vampire

06:08.400 --> 06:10.095
and also
a ghost whisperer.

06:10.130 --> 06:11.393
You don't know that.

06:11.430 --> 06:13.660
- What if this is about
finding your door?

06:13.700 --> 06:16.408
What if part of your closure
is protecting Bridget?

06:16.440 --> 06:18.169
- Like condoms
on a bed stand?

06:18.210 --> 06:19.166
- From Danny.

06:19.210 --> 06:21.269
- How am I supposed
to help Bridget

06:21.310 --> 06:23.278
if she doesn't
want my help?

06:23.310 --> 06:26.940
- Maybe she isn't strong enough
to face the trouble she's in

06:26.980 --> 06:29.620
or maybe it's you,
not Bridget,

06:29.650 --> 06:32.210
that needs to
make Danny stop.

06:33.820 --> 06:36.949
- I wasn't strong enough
in the first place.

06:36.990 --> 06:40.051
- Oh, that's not true.
You had plans, remember?

06:40.100 --> 06:41.795
You were gonna do something
with your life.

06:41.830 --> 06:43.889
You're tough, Sally.

06:43.930 --> 06:45.227
And if you could make

06:45.270 --> 06:47.739
any physical impact
on me whatsoever...

06:47.770 --> 06:49.499
(Sighing)

06:49.540 --> 06:51.634
...I'd be wary of you.

06:52.910 --> 06:56.699
You were strong
before Danny derailed you.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.572
And you know
what he is now.

07:00.650 --> 07:03.347
And he can't
hurt you anymore.

07:05.650 --> 07:07.652
(Sighing)

07:27.440 --> 07:29.431
- Ah!

07:30.080 --> 07:32.003
(Screaming)

07:33.280 --> 07:35.339
(Screaming)

07:37.390 --> 07:41.349
(Screaming)

07:43.730 --> 07:45.289
(Screaming)

07:46.430 --> 07:47.591
(Screaming)

07:47.630 --> 07:50.099
- Josh?

07:50.130 --> 07:51.689
Josh?

07:54.340 --> 07:55.967
Josh?

08:03.480 --> 08:06.450
- Two years is too long.
They're gonna freak.

08:06.480 --> 08:09.279
- You'll be fine.
- No, there will be freaking.

08:09.320 --> 08:12.290
- Josh, Dad caught me
macking with Amy Brennan

08:12.320 --> 08:14.311
full-on second base
right there.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.418
Did he freak?

08:15.460 --> 08:17.724
- You got to second base
with Amy Brennan?

08:20.200 --> 08:21.395
That's like my bucket list.

08:22.700 --> 08:26.739
- It's Mom and Dad. You're
like the prodigal son returned.

08:30.710 --> 08:34.533
- Oh my God! Your father's
gonna have a stroke.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.173
- I'm fine.

08:40.179 --> 08:41.943
- Josh.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.948
- Hi, Mom.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.560
- Thanks for bringing
this one home.

08:49.560 --> 08:52.359
OK, so we're
gonna go inside,

08:52.390 --> 08:54.154
we're gonna put something
into that stomach

08:54.200 --> 08:56.726
and then we're gonna
go see Dr. Ruben.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.467
- He's my paediatrician.
- Since you were nothing.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.662
So he knows your body
better than anybody.

09:15.750 --> 09:20.085
- Well, you got that
werewolf sister pretty good.

09:22.830 --> 09:25.219
- If Aidan had been attacked
by a pack of dogs,

09:25.260 --> 09:27.126
he would've done
the same thing.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.457
- Uh-huh...

09:28.500 --> 09:31.720
- And you would've slapped him
on the back for a job well done.

09:31.770 --> 09:37.209
- Aidan never got himself into
embarrassing situations like this.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.265
I think you've
done enough.

09:39.310 --> 09:41.074
(Pen clicking, paper rustling)

09:54.190 --> 09:56.079
- (Josh's mom): Josh?

09:57.090 --> 09:58.421
- Yeah?

09:58.460 --> 10:01.100
- I'm making chicken.
You hungry?

10:02.100 --> 10:03.090
- OK.

10:03.130 --> 10:05.394
** Should've been easier *

10:05.430 --> 10:08.400
* To wash my hands
of all of this... *

10:08.440 --> 10:13.105
Hey, is Mom existing in a
parallel universe right now?

10:13.140 --> 10:14.778
- What do you mean?

10:14.810 --> 10:16.505
- You don't think she's
acting a little strange,

10:16.540 --> 10:19.601
like I just got home
from summer camp?

10:19.650 --> 10:21.379
She's making chicken!

10:21.420 --> 10:22.717
(Sizzling)

10:22.750 --> 10:24.514
- What would you
like her to do?

10:24.550 --> 10:28.509
- I don't know. She hasn't
seen me in 2 years.

10:28.560 --> 10:31.484
Show some emotion?
How about a guilt trip?

10:31.530 --> 10:34.090
- Mom's not gonna
say anything, Josh.

10:34.130 --> 10:36.895
She's--she's terrified.

10:37.900 --> 10:38.867
- Of me?

10:38.900 --> 10:40.061
- Of losing you.

10:40.100 --> 10:42.831
* 'Cause I can't
afford the doubt *

10:42.870 --> 10:45.032
<i>* I can't afford the trust... **</i>

10:45.070 --> 10:46.265
- And Dad? What?

10:46.310 --> 10:49.439
He's so scared of me he can't
even bother to show his face?

10:49.480 --> 10:51.300
(Inhaling and exhaling)

10:51.350 --> 10:53.444
- Dad doesn't
live here anymore.

10:58.990 --> 11:00.651
- Because?

11:01.490 --> 11:03.151
- They're separated.

11:05.090 --> 11:06.990
- Since when?

11:07.030 --> 11:08.327
- Since when
do you think?

11:12.130 --> 11:14.770
- Good, you can
help me with the salad.

11:14.800 --> 11:15.835
- You're separated?

11:17.040 --> 11:21.102
- Yes, but... you don't
have to worry about that.

11:21.140 --> 11:23.347
- Yes, yes, I do
because, apparently Mom,

11:23.380 --> 11:25.041
I'm the one
who caused it.

11:25.080 --> 11:28.345
- Can we just... Can we discuss
this when your father's here?

11:28.380 --> 11:32.817
- I'm uncomfortable with
that. I don't-- - Hello? Josh.

11:34.290 --> 11:35.951
It's good to see you.

11:35.990 --> 11:38.630
- Thanks, yeah.

11:40.960 --> 11:44.066
Can we...
Do you mind if we--we...

11:46.200 --> 11:47.270
I lost it, OK?

11:47.300 --> 11:49.689
I flipped out
and I am so sorry

11:49.740 --> 11:54.439
if I caused or contributed
to whatever happened here, OK?

11:54.480 --> 11:55.709
But it's just...

11:55.740 --> 11:58.050
It's vitally important
that you both know I'm OK.

11:58.080 --> 12:01.209
Whatever it was that
I had, it's under control.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.241
I've seen a doctor,
I'm on medication,

12:03.290 --> 12:05.384
I'm working
in a hospital in Boston.

12:05.420 --> 12:08.913
I'm actually
sort of... happy.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.522
Really. So just...

12:12.560 --> 12:16.861
You don't--you don't need
to worry about me, OK?

12:16.900 --> 12:20.336
- Thank you, Josh,
for sharing that.

12:20.370 --> 12:21.895
- Yes, thank you.

12:21.940 --> 12:24.807
- OK, guys, seriously, can we
just stop thanking each other

12:24.840 --> 12:28.071
and act like blood relatives
for a minute?

12:28.110 --> 12:33.048
You don't have to treat me with kid
gloves either. If you wanna shout, shout.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.150
- OK.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.179
So long has
it been, Josh?

12:39.220 --> 12:41.780
- Uh, how long
has what been?

12:41.820 --> 12:44.619
- How long have you
thought you were a werewolf?

12:48.800 --> 12:49.824
(Sighing)

12:49.870 --> 12:53.238
- Did I just...
Did you just say...

12:53.270 --> 12:55.762
Did I just hear you say
that you thought

12:55.800 --> 12:57.962
that I thought
that I was a...

12:59.840 --> 13:02.275
Where did
you get that?

13:02.310 --> 13:04.449
That's my personal...

13:06.280 --> 13:08.317
(Whispering): Emily.

13:08.350 --> 13:10.819
That's--that's
not even...

13:10.850 --> 13:13.820
Do you really think that
I think that I'm a werewolf?

13:13.860 --> 13:15.214
- Do you, Josh?

13:15.260 --> 13:16.853
- No, Mom! God!

13:16.890 --> 13:20.827
I... Why would you
even think that?

13:20.860 --> 13:24.296
- "Scientific research has
confirmed one fundamental fact:

13:24.330 --> 13:25.798
<i>"Tm a werewolf.</i>

13:25.830 --> 13:28.197
"But my research has yet

13:28.240 --> 13:31.369
- "to answer the
most important question: Why?"

13:31.410 --> 13:32.832
- Yes.

13:33.840 --> 13:35.672
You think that's me.

13:37.280 --> 13:40.477
Guys! I hate to
break it to you,

13:40.520 --> 13:43.217
but those are...
that... those are notes

13:43.250 --> 13:46.914
for a graphic novel

13:46.960 --> 13:50.260
about a guy who
thinks he's a wolf.

13:50.290 --> 13:52.827
(Laughing)

13:54.160 --> 13:55.821
Guys.

13:58.830 --> 14:00.389
- Tell you what.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.795
Let's eat, catch up

14:02.840 --> 14:05.537
and... then we can talk.

14:06.570 --> 14:07.969
- Let's do that.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.880
- (Woman on TV): As it is the
business of any legal action

14:11.910 --> 14:14.379
to discover if compelling
evidence may be produced.

14:14.420 --> 14:18.345
(Channels flipping
rapidly on TV)

14:23.960 --> 14:25.951
(Panting)

14:48.250 --> 14:49.615
(Gasps)

14:54.020 --> 14:55.886
- (Sally):
That's right.

14:55.920 --> 14:59.379
How does it feel?

14:59.430 --> 15:01.125
(Gasps)

15:01.160 --> 15:04.721
Maybe one tenth of
how scared you made me?

15:04.770 --> 15:06.795
- Sally?

15:08.970 --> 15:10.665
(Breathing raggedly)

15:10.710 --> 15:12.337
Sally, is that you?

15:13.340 --> 15:14.307
- Oh!

15:14.340 --> 15:15.307
- 'Cause if it is,

15:15.340 --> 15:17.047
I've got a question for you.

15:19.610 --> 15:21.840
That's the best you've got?

15:23.720 --> 15:26.883
A busted light bulb
and some spilt beer?

15:28.560 --> 15:31.552
This is supposed
to scare me? Really?

15:32.630 --> 15:34.394
God, Sally!

15:34.430 --> 15:38.094
You're more pathetic as
a ghost than you were alive.

15:38.130 --> 15:41.395
And let's just be clear here.
That's pretty pathetic.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.259
- What?

15:42.300 --> 15:43.665
- You know, I heard

15:43.710 --> 15:47.738
about you roaming the halls of
our old place. Baby, that's just sad.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.647
You still don't have
anything better to do

15:50.680 --> 15:53.115
than wait for me
to come home.

15:53.150 --> 15:55.949
- That's never who I wanted
to be. You made me into that!

15:55.980 --> 16:01.612
- And all that crap about how
I made you give up your dreams.

16:01.660 --> 16:04.152
You were just waiting
for me to knock you up

16:04.190 --> 16:06.682
so you could sit at home
and watch Lifetime.

16:06.730 --> 16:08.619
- SHUT UP!

16:11.630 --> 16:12.791
- You know,

16:12.830 --> 16:15.765
you might scare Bridget
with this crap, sweetheart,

16:15.800 --> 16:17.962
but you don't scare me.

16:18.010 --> 16:20.138
Because I know
you're nothing.

16:21.140 --> 16:22.835
You're dead.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.079
And I'm alive.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.169
I'm alive.

16:28.980 --> 16:30.948
And I'm happy...

16:32.950 --> 16:34.782
finally.

16:41.560 --> 16:42.630
- So...

16:43.700 --> 16:46.522
at least you got
your next book, right?

16:46.570 --> 16:49.892
Mom has a breakdown,
Emily starts kissing girls

16:49.940 --> 16:52.762
and your son thinks
he's a werewolf.

16:54.040 --> 16:57.704
You gotta admit, it's pretty
much the psychotherapy jackpot,

16:57.750 --> 16:59.002
don't you think?

17:01.720 --> 17:03.142
Don't do that.

17:03.190 --> 17:06.046
- Don't what?
- Don't shrink me.

17:06.089 --> 17:08.912
You said you wanted
to talk. Let's talk.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.484
- I'm just trying
to understand.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.521
- So ask, scream.
I'm your son.

17:12.560 --> 17:13.789
You can talk to me.

17:13.829 --> 17:15.252
(Sighing)

17:22.200 --> 17:23.861
- I'm sorry. I...

17:24.910 --> 17:27.607
thought you needed help.
I got scared.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.405
(Doorbell ringing)

17:30.450 --> 17:32.043
(Sighing)

17:33.080 --> 17:34.047
- I swear to God,

17:34.080 --> 17:36.174
if that's my
high-school math teacher here

17:36.220 --> 17:38.348
for an intervention,
I'll cut my face off.

17:45.490 --> 17:47.322
- Just hear me out.
I can help.

17:47.360 --> 17:51.695
- What? You can't be here.
- Josh, Josh, let me in. - No, no!

17:51.730 --> 17:53.437
This is my family.

17:53.470 --> 17:55.234
- You must be
Josh's mother.

17:55.270 --> 17:56.635
- Yes.

17:56.670 --> 17:58.638
- I'm Aidan.
I'm Josh's roommate.

17:58.670 --> 17:59.899
- Oh!

17:59.940 --> 18:02.034
- He's just passing through.
He's leaving.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.048
- Actually, I'd kill
for a glass of water.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.048
- Oh, well, we can do
better than water.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.741
You like roast chicken?
- No, Mom.

18:07.780 --> 18:12.320
- I love roast chicken.
- Good. Well, all right then. Come on in.

18:22.230 --> 18:25.791
So, Aidan, you and Josh
met at the hospital.

18:25.830 --> 18:27.594
- We did.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.405
- Their place is
actually decent, Mom.

18:30.440 --> 18:33.375
Not your typical
bachelor-roofie den.

18:33.410 --> 18:35.879
- Ah, that's reassuring.

18:35.910 --> 18:36.900
(Laughing)

18:36.940 --> 18:39.580
- Hmm...

18:39.610 --> 18:44.013
- Uh, this chicken is delicious.
- Thank you, Aidan.

18:47.190 --> 18:49.158
So Josh says
that he's happy.

18:49.190 --> 18:52.023
See, are you two,

18:52.060 --> 18:55.223
uh, happy as roommates?

18:55.260 --> 18:56.398
- Mom!

18:56.430 --> 18:58.592
- We are.
Yeah, he is, really.

18:58.630 --> 19:00.997
You don't mind if I...
- If you what?

19:01.040 --> 19:04.203
- Josh had a girl over
the other night.

19:04.240 --> 19:07.278
- Ahem! No, I don't mind.
Please continue.

19:07.310 --> 19:09.199
- Just a great girl.

19:09.240 --> 19:12.039
Smart and funny. And I don't
mean to sell your son out.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.377
- No, of course not.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.946
- But get
a couple glasses in him,

19:15.980 --> 19:18.119
and he knows
how to charm a lady.

19:18.150 --> 19:19.379
(Laughing)

19:19.420 --> 19:22.651
- -We're OK with
drinking on the medication?

19:22.690 --> 19:25.125
- I'm not... I don't...

19:26.590 --> 19:32.529
do that.
- No, I think it's good to have other forms of... recreation.

19:32.570 --> 19:34.538
- Oh my God!
- I'd be worried

19:34.570 --> 19:38.006
if you were spending
all the time on that book.

19:42.240 --> 19:46.370
- What book?
- My graphic novel, ahem, about werewolves

19:46.410 --> 19:50.017
that my family thinks
is a personal journal.

19:50.050 --> 19:52.189
My personal journal.

19:54.190 --> 19:56.852
(Both laughing)

19:58.430 --> 20:02.492
- Hold on for a second.
So...

20:02.530 --> 20:06.398
OK, you think that Josh
thinks that he's a werewolf?

20:06.430 --> 20:08.762
- Right?
It's nuts on toast, right?

20:08.800 --> 20:09.460
(Coughing)

20:09.500 --> 20:10.433
Yeah.

20:10.470 --> 20:13.576
So, guys, can we put
this to bed now please?

20:13.610 --> 20:17.274
I'm not crazy.
It's not a journal, OK?

20:17.310 --> 20:20.143
I don't believe that I'm a wolf.
I don't believe in monsters.

20:20.180 --> 20:24.686
You know why? 'Cause there's no
such thing as monsters. (Gasping)

20:24.720 --> 20:25.949
- Aidan, are you OK?

20:25.990 --> 20:27.617
- I'm fine. I'm sorry.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.310
(Laughing)

20:29.360 --> 20:30.452
Um...

20:34.100 --> 20:35.955
- Here's the deal.
You know what?

20:36.000 --> 20:37.468
He just went through
a bad breakup.

20:37.500 --> 20:38.319
I'm gonna
go check on him

20:38.370 --> 20:40.190
because I don't think
he's all right.

20:46.140 --> 20:47.835
- Just something happened.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.939
I--I don't know. Uh...

20:49.980 --> 20:52.699
- Are you kidding me? Now?
You have to do this now?

20:52.750 --> 20:56.050
- Does your mom cook with garlic?
- I don't know.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.286
Seriously,
is that a thing?

20:57.320 --> 20:59.186
- Yes or no, Josh!
- I guess so.

20:59.220 --> 20:59.982
Does it kill you?

21:00.020 --> 21:01.215
- No, no, it doesn't.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.251
It just...
It makes us, us.

21:03.290 --> 21:06.726
- OK, OK, so stop being
you. How? How do we do that?

21:06.760 --> 21:08.728
- Uh, feverfew.

21:08.760 --> 21:13.391
- Fever... what? Is that a band?
- It's an herb, Josh!

21:13.440 --> 21:18.105
- OK, how about any other herb? Any other herb, like, on earth!
- Mistletoe?

21:18.140 --> 21:23.203
- How about matzo meal? Anything I
don't have to summon a warlock for?

21:23.240 --> 21:25.379
OK, all right.

21:25.410 --> 21:26.741
Everything's fine.

21:26.780 --> 21:28.919
Aidan's just having
a reaction to something he ate,

21:28.950 --> 21:32.386
so I'm bringing him some
camomile tea, some camomile tea.

21:35.420 --> 21:39.527
OK, OK. So we have camomile-
lavender, camomile-mint.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.358
I think there's
like a lemon in here.

21:41.400 --> 21:47.169
And you're naked and taking a bath in the middle of dinner.
- Out!

21:47.200 --> 21:51.831
- Um, I don't wanna be in here. OK, fine, good.
- Out! Out! Out!

22:08.120 --> 22:10.214
- You got rain
on the drive, huh?

22:10.260 --> 22:12.228
Well, they said we might
get some tonight.

22:12.260 --> 22:14.991
- Hello, Josh.

22:19.570 --> 22:21.299
>K

22:39.150 --> 22:40.857
- Don't open that door.

22:40.890 --> 22:43.860
Do not invite that man
into this house. Just don't!

22:43.890 --> 22:47.053
- What? Oh, this is ridiculous!
- No, Dad, don't!

22:47.090 --> 22:49.400
(Dog barking in distance)

22:52.970 --> 22:55.598
- Josh, why
don't you tell me

22:55.640 --> 22:57.859
what you think
is happening right now?

23:06.280 --> 23:09.443
Son, this
isn't a solution.

23:09.480 --> 23:10.948
- Take this.
- Josh.

23:10.990 --> 23:14.984
- If he gets inside, you need to
cut his head off. Cut it off completely.

23:15.020 --> 23:16.317
- Do you understand me?
- What?

23:16.360 --> 23:19.352
- OK, yes, keep them
behind you, all right?

23:19.390 --> 23:22.894
- Josh! This is crazy!
- Just do what I say.

23:22.930 --> 23:24.796
Aidan! Aidan!

23:28.970 --> 23:31.337
(Dog barking in distance)

23:34.740 --> 23:37.971
(Grunting)

23:38.010 --> 23:41.310
- Josh, what's going on?
- Not now, Dad.

23:42.580 --> 23:44.389
(Grunting)

23:49.420 --> 23:51.229
(Laughing)

23:53.290 --> 23:54.997
(Laughing)

23:55.960 --> 23:59.328
- The lengths you go to,
to protect them now!

23:59.370 --> 24:00.963
(Laughing)

24:01.000 --> 24:02.536
- And the lengths
you'll go to, to kill

24:02.570 --> 24:04.868
when you tell Bishop
you failed!

24:04.910 --> 24:06.765
- Bishop didn't send me.

24:06.810 --> 24:08.938
- Whatever's
going on, Josh,

24:08.980 --> 24:11.904
we can sit down
and talk about it.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.741
- He didn't ever want me

24:15.780 --> 24:19.239
to mess with his
little prince's pet.

24:19.290 --> 24:22.214
- So you come out here on your
own to the suburbs to what?

24:22.260 --> 24:23.216
Kill them all?

24:23.260 --> 24:24.659
- Who are you
trying to hurt?

24:24.690 --> 24:27.227
The dog you keep saying
is beneath you, or me?

24:27.260 --> 24:31.026
If this is about us, then
you keep it between us! Oh!

24:31.070 --> 24:33.596
- Bishop would
never let me do

24:33.640 --> 24:38.407
what I truly wanna
do with you. (Grunting)

24:41.210 --> 24:42.871
(Josh's mom gasps)

24:48.350 --> 24:49.749
Come on out!

24:50.480 --> 24:52.244
Here, boy!

24:52.290 --> 24:55.282
- Oh my God!
- (Emily): Josh, put it down! - Josh, wait!

24:55.320 --> 24:56.310
(Grunting)

24:56.360 --> 24:58.454
- Come on,
little doggie!

25:04.600 --> 25:06.398
(Grunting)

25:09.500 --> 25:10.934
(Grunting)

25:10.970 --> 25:12.961
- Aidan!

25:13.010 --> 25:14.432
- I got this.

25:14.480 --> 25:17.472
Aaah! Oh! Oh!

25:19.010 --> 25:21.877
You kill me now if you
think you've got it in you

25:21.920 --> 25:23.911
and you pay
the price of Bishop,

25:23.950 --> 25:28.854
but you leave my friend
and his family out of it.

25:30.790 --> 25:34.658
- You and your doggie
aren't worth it.

25:41.100 --> 25:44.559
(Panting)

25:48.040 --> 25:50.532
- I know you don't
wanna admit it.

25:50.580 --> 25:54.175
You think it'll get better
in a couple weeks.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.712
Hmm? A couple months.

25:57.720 --> 25:59.848
If you wear a new dress.

26:00.820 --> 26:02.686
If you try
a new position.

26:04.160 --> 26:07.084
If you bake the perfect
frigging cake.

26:10.500 --> 26:12.559
This isn't you, Bridget.

26:13.570 --> 26:15.561
And it wasn't me.

26:16.700 --> 26:20.204
It's just how Danny
got into our heads.

26:20.240 --> 26:23.369
And I swear to God
I'm gonna make him stop.

26:24.380 --> 26:26.371
But I need you
to help me.

26:27.410 --> 26:30.516
I need you to understand
what he did to me.

26:39.830 --> 26:42.492
I know you feel me.

26:51.810 --> 26:53.801
(Gasps)

26:57.240 --> 26:58.378
(Panting)

26:58.410 --> 27:00.504
- Are you there?

27:02.480 --> 27:04.619
Why are you doing this?

27:05.650 --> 27:07.618
(Panting)

27:17.830 --> 27:19.821
(Gasps)

27:24.070 --> 27:26.061
(Panting)

27:29.610 --> 27:31.078
- You need help.

27:32.910 --> 27:35.811
- There's no way to fix
what's wrong with me.

27:35.850 --> 27:38.979
- There is always a solution.
- No, there isn't.

27:39.020 --> 27:42.354
- You just need to be
open to accepting it.

27:46.260 --> 27:46.783
- You...

27:48.360 --> 27:54.265
just refuse to see this as anything
other than black and white, don't you?

27:54.300 --> 27:58.066
Like you always did, like
we're part of your next study.

27:58.110 --> 28:01.501
- You keep saying that. Is that
how you feel? Like I've studied you?

28:01.540 --> 28:03.702
- No, if you'd
studied me,

28:03.750 --> 28:06.310
you would've realized
something was wrong.

28:06.350 --> 28:07.499
Let me ask
you something.

28:07.550 --> 28:09.917
Before I left,
before I flipped out,

28:09.950 --> 28:13.648
did it ever occur to you
that I was unhappy?

28:13.690 --> 28:15.010
- You were driven.
- You were driving me!

28:15.060 --> 28:17.483
- What are you saying?
You don't have a problem?

28:17.520 --> 28:19.579
Because healthy people
don't do this, Josh.

28:19.630 --> 28:22.327
Healthy people don't
run out on their family,

28:22.360 --> 28:23.964
their fiance,
their future

28:24.000 --> 28:28.392
without more than a scrap
of paper saying "I'm sorry."

28:30.740 --> 28:32.936
Maybe I pushed
too hard.

28:33.940 --> 28:37.103
But only because
you always acted

28:37.140 --> 28:41.543
like that was what
you wanted out of life.

28:41.580 --> 28:42.911
Son...

28:43.920 --> 28:46.810
you can't
possibly want this.

28:48.320 --> 28:51.028
- We'll help you,
Josh, whatever this is.

28:55.030 --> 28:58.022
Please! You can't
possibly want this.

29:12.580 --> 29:14.548
- I don't.

29:15.580 --> 29:17.070
You're right.

29:18.620 --> 29:19.985
You're right.

29:21.020 --> 29:23.057
It's not
a graphic novel.

29:25.490 --> 29:27.151
It's not fantasy.

29:30.260 --> 29:32.797
It's happening to me.

29:32.830 --> 29:36.289
- What is happening
to you, baby?

29:38.640 --> 29:41.075
- I'm a werewolf.

29:43.910 --> 29:45.674
That's who I am.

29:47.080 --> 29:49.219
That's why I left.

29:55.460 --> 29:59.419
What possible place
is there for me here?

30:18.750 --> 30:20.741
(Sighing)

30:24.250 --> 30:26.719
- Are you OK?

30:26.750 --> 30:29.754
- I need you to tell me
how Sally died.

30:29.790 --> 30:32.589
- You know how she died.

30:32.630 --> 30:34.951
You were practically
the first to know.

30:36.360 --> 30:39.864
- Keep going, Bridge.
You're doing the right thing.

30:39.900 --> 30:41.436
- Did you kill her?

30:41.470 --> 30:44.201
- What? How could you...

30:44.240 --> 30:47.107
How could you
say that to me?

30:48.440 --> 30:51.444
- 'Cause I think that's
what she's saying to me.

30:59.920 --> 31:01.684
(Ragged breathing)

31:01.720 --> 31:03.449
- Finally.

31:03.490 --> 31:05.584
- It was an accident.

31:05.630 --> 31:07.758
- So it's true?

31:07.790 --> 31:09.394
- No! No.

31:09.430 --> 31:13.628
Look, Sally and me, it wasn't
like how you and I are, Bridget.

31:13.670 --> 31:15.092
We weren't happy.

31:15.140 --> 31:18.906
I never fought with anyone
like I fought with her.

31:18.940 --> 31:21.602
She made me so...

31:21.640 --> 31:25.804
I wasn't myself.
- So it's my fault?

31:25.850 --> 31:28.649
- She was
so strong!

31:29.550 --> 31:31.484
You know
how Sally was.

31:31.520 --> 31:34.717
I felt like she didn't
need me. I got insecure.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.387
- So you had
to beat me down.

31:36.420 --> 31:38.821
- And that night,
she lost her ring.

31:38.860 --> 31:39.827
- The ring.

31:39.860 --> 31:42.557
- She said it
went down the drain.

31:43.970 --> 31:45.768
And I didn't believe her.

31:45.800 --> 31:48.929
So... we got
into a fight.

31:48.970 --> 31:49.960
I grabbed her arm.

31:51.670 --> 31:54.002
She fell, but I would never...

31:54.040 --> 31:56.134
- Ah!

31:56.180 --> 31:57.830
- God, I didn't... No.

31:57.880 --> 31:59.939
(Sighing)

31:59.980 --> 32:02.210
- So she thinks
you killed her.

32:02.250 --> 32:04.218
- God! Maybe
I did, Bridge.

32:04.250 --> 32:06.787
God! Maybe I did,
but I never would've...

32:07.790 --> 32:09.918
She was
everything to me.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.929
You know, I keep trying
to take back that second

32:13.960 --> 32:15.223
when her ankle twisted.

32:16.400 --> 32:19.461
- Bridget, no,
he's not sorry.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.367
- You know,
every morning, I wake up

32:22.400 --> 32:27.133
and I think about how
I ruined my life, our life.

32:27.170 --> 32:29.002
- Bridget, no.

32:29.040 --> 32:31.350
- (Sobbing):
I loved her so much.

32:31.380 --> 32:34.418
- Bridget. Bridget,
do not believe him.

32:37.880 --> 32:39.211
- It was an accident.

32:40.220 --> 32:41.688
I know that now.

32:44.930 --> 32:46.352
>K

32:54.440 --> 32:58.206
- It was strangely thrilling
to finally just...

32:58.240 --> 32:59.833
say it to them.

32:59.870 --> 33:01.474
(Birds chirping)

33:01.510 --> 33:04.445
And yet, somehow...

33:04.480 --> 33:07.302
incredibly anticlimactic.

33:08.550 --> 33:11.645
(Train whistle
blowing in distance)

33:11.690 --> 33:14.113
- You know, I tried
the same thing...

33:15.620 --> 33:17.679
a long time ago.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.859
(Crow cawing)

33:22.400 --> 33:25.267
My wife and my son.

33:28.500 --> 33:32.459
I thought there must be
some way to explain it to them,

33:32.510 --> 33:35.605
to, uh, be what I had become...

33:36.610 --> 33:38.339
and keep them.

33:39.680 --> 33:44.686
In time, they would understand.
They're my family.

33:44.720 --> 33:46.745
That's what I told myself.

33:47.750 --> 33:49.514
(Sighing)

33:50.020 --> 33:51.829
- What happened?

33:58.870 --> 34:00.668
- We should go.

34:02.470 --> 34:04.404
- What if you were right?

34:05.410 --> 34:07.208
Trying, I mean.

34:09.810 --> 34:14.007
I can manage this. It's one night a
month. I can-- - No, it's bigger than that.

34:14.050 --> 34:16.917
- And Marcus?
I mean, what if he's...

34:16.949 --> 34:19.748
I'm supposed to just leave
my family if he's coming back?

34:19.790 --> 34:22.589
- No, he's not.
It's between me and him now.

34:22.620 --> 34:25.590
But, Josh, he was
coming after you.

34:25.630 --> 34:28.121
You do not
make it safer here.

34:28.159 --> 34:29.696
- I can explain
it to them...

34:31.000 --> 34:34.630
walk them through it. They're
educated; they're reasonable.

34:34.670 --> 34:38.208
- So you explain it
to them, and maybe one day,

34:38.239 --> 34:40.958
they'll even believe
that you are a wolf.

34:41.010 --> 34:44.139
And so they'll
build you a cage.

34:44.179 --> 34:46.739
And it'll work.

34:46.780 --> 34:51.684
Every month, you'll transform
in the comfort of your own home.

34:51.719 --> 34:52.846
And in the morning,

34:52.889 --> 34:56.349
your parents will be waiting
for you with food and water.

34:56.389 --> 34:58.051
And they will clean you

34:58.090 --> 35:01.299
like the day that you
were born because...

35:02.760 --> 35:05.468
because he's not a monster.

35:06.900 --> 35:08.732
He's our son.

35:08.770 --> 35:13.367
And he would never,
ever hurt us.

35:14.710 --> 35:17.099
So one day, someone will
leave the cage unlocked

35:17.140 --> 35:20.872
because what's the worst
that can happen?

35:20.910 --> 35:23.140
And brutally,

35:23.180 --> 35:25.786
against your human will...

35:28.420 --> 35:30.650
you will kill them all.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.064
- I won't let it
get to that.

35:42.470 --> 35:45.167
I know what I'm doing now.
I'll go to the woods.

35:45.210 --> 35:49.807
- No matter what you do, they're gonna
wanna get involved. They're your family.

35:52.080 --> 35:56.278
Which is exactly why they're
defenceless against you.

35:56.320 --> 35:59.585
- I've already hurt them
too much not to try.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.959
(Horns honking, siren wailing)

36:15.340 --> 36:17.331
(Man laughing)

36:20.840 --> 36:23.969
- Aidan! Oh,
what a nice surprise!

36:24.010 --> 36:25.307
- Who are they?

36:25.350 --> 36:29.514
- Well, I told you
things had changed.

36:31.220 --> 36:33.040
- Some things
never change.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.750
You stay away
from my friends.

36:37.790 --> 36:39.622
- Sure.

36:42.630 --> 36:46.624
- Aidan...
- You stink like one, you know?

36:46.670 --> 36:49.389
Yeah, it's all over you.

36:50.370 --> 36:56.230
Doggie stink, doggie sweat,
doggie tears.

36:56.280 --> 36:57.372
(Laughing)

36:57.410 --> 36:59.242
Folks are gonna
start to wonder.

36:59.280 --> 37:02.716
- Wonder about what, Marcus?

37:02.750 --> 37:06.983
How our family could
turn its back on its own?

37:07.020 --> 37:08.818
Turn its back
on the weakest among us?

37:08.860 --> 37:11.215
We have too much to do
in too little time

37:11.260 --> 37:13.922
to lay waste to
the one strength we have.

37:13.960 --> 37:15.826
That goes for the weakest.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.396
And that goes
for the mistakes.

37:42.260 --> 37:46.549
** Who would've thought
the boy could fly... *

37:46.590 --> 37:49.594
- So you think Dad's gonna run off
with some 25-year-old babe? (Laughing)

37:49.630 --> 37:50.893
- How jealous would you be?

37:50.930 --> 37:54.594
- How jealous would you be?
(Both laughing)

37:54.640 --> 37:58.190
- You're gonna stay,
right? For a while?

37:58.240 --> 38:01.972
I could come home
once a month, help out.

38:02.010 --> 38:03.671
Whatever you need.

38:05.210 --> 38:08.771
* 'Cause only
the dreamer knows *

38:08.820 --> 38:09.878
Come on.
* That life is not *

38:09.920 --> 38:11.274
* The world you see *

38:11.320 --> 38:12.947
- Josh, come have
some chicken.

38:12.990 --> 38:14.515
* It gets better than this *

38:14.560 --> 38:20.283
* Imagination exists *

38:20.330 --> 38:24.221
* 'Cause you're not alone *

38:24.260 --> 38:28.299
* You carried
the weight of us all *

38:28.340 --> 38:32.265
* You're not alone anymore *

38:32.310 --> 38:35.371
* Still tryin'
to bring us home *

38:35.410 --> 38:39.244
* Remember the hero *

38:39.280 --> 38:43.547
* The boy that could
reach to your soul *

38:43.580 --> 38:47.915
* You're not alone anymore *

38:50.820 --> 38:56.623
* Who would've thought
the boy could fly? **

39:01.700 --> 39:03.395
- Hello?

39:08.480 --> 39:10.005
Sally?

39:13.210 --> 39:15.269
- I'm here.

39:20.420 --> 39:22.582
- I'm sorry...

39:24.120 --> 39:26.384
about how you died.

39:27.890 --> 39:29.995
And I miss you...

39:31.000 --> 39:32.490
every day.

39:35.540 --> 39:38.805
But this is the last time
I'm gonna talk to you.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.550
And if you come to me,

39:44.580 --> 39:48.448
if you haunt
me or Danny...

39:48.480 --> 39:50.517
I won't acknowledge you...

39:51.920 --> 39:55.481
no matter
how loud you scream...

39:56.760 --> 39:59.821
no matter
how scared I am.

40:02.660 --> 40:06.028
This ends now.

40:09.170 --> 40:11.867
- He'll do it to you.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.402
It's just who he is.

40:16.740 --> 40:19.346
- You're not at rest.

40:20.410 --> 40:22.378
I get that now.

40:23.820 --> 40:27.142
But it didn't happen
the way you think it did.

40:28.350 --> 40:31.650
Just accept that.

40:34.090 --> 40:38.869
Accept that and maybe you can
find some peace and move on.

40:41.100 --> 40:43.865
We're moving on.

40:45.710 --> 40:49.476
And you need to
leave us alone.

41:05.160 --> 41:07.379
** My old friend *

41:09.300 --> 41:13.089
* Tell me,
where have you been? *

41:14.230 --> 41:16.631
* Have I wasted away? *

41:18.770 --> 41:22.229
* All my tears turn to time *

41:23.340 --> 41:24.705
(Door closing)

41:24.750 --> 41:27.742
* My old friend *

41:33.120 --> 41:34.588
(Inhaling)

41:34.620 --> 41:36.054
- And what happened?

41:37.060 --> 41:38.619
- The worst.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.859
* My old friend *

41:45.900 --> 41:46.719
(Door opening)

41:48.030 --> 41:51.910
* Tell me, where have
you been? * (Door closing)

41:53.310 --> 41:56.029
* Have I wasted away? *

41:58.240 --> 42:00.971
* Did you wait till the end? *

* My old friend **

42:05.850 --> 42:07.841
(Crows cawing)

42:10.020 --> 42:12.079
(Woodpecker chittering)

42:31.210 --> 42:36.239
- I have news from Boston,
born in concern.

42:36.280 --> 42:37.941
May I see them?

42:45.790 --> 42:48.623
- It's 2 hours
until sundown.

42:48.660 --> 42:50.298
- I'll wait.
