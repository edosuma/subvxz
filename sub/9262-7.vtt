WEBVTT

00:00.709 --> 00:02.647
Previously on "The Shield"...

00:02.682 --> 00:03.878
We're targeting
Cruz Pezuela.

00:03.913 --> 00:05.773
Aceveda's one-man
campaign bankroll?

00:05.808 --> 00:08.117
He's buying up Farmington
with cartel money.

00:08.151 --> 00:10.197
Blackmail... that's how
Pezuela's getting everyone

00:10.198 --> 00:11.757
on board the train
to cartel town.

00:11.792 --> 00:13.021
Pezuela's got it in his head

00:13.056 --> 00:15.140
that the armenians
have the blackmail box.

00:15.175 --> 00:17.021
We need a quick Armenian
political win.

00:17.056 --> 00:18.598
City controller...
Robert Martin.

00:18.633 --> 00:20.558
He's in the blackmail box?

00:20.593 --> 00:21.320
Robert! Oh, my God!

00:21.355 --> 00:23.568
That was a goddamn
assassination!

00:23.603 --> 00:26.442
I want Pezuela in prison
and out of my life now.

00:26.477 --> 00:28.437
Agent Murray's looking
to take down the cartel.

00:28.472 --> 00:29.660
She's in the blackmail box?

00:29.695 --> 00:31.467
I'm turning over the box
to justice.

00:31.502 --> 00:32.287
What about Olivia?

00:32.323 --> 00:35.488
If she's got to get dragged down
to bust Pezuela, so be it.

00:35.523 --> 00:36.769
Shane?

00:36.804 --> 00:38.776
You dropped a grenade
in his lap, and what

00:38.811 --> 00:40.008
did you do? Did you run?

00:40.043 --> 00:43.283
I got a plan that will give Lem
the justice he deserves.

00:43.318 --> 00:44.305
This is taking too long.

00:44.340 --> 00:45.305
Take a look around.

00:45.340 --> 00:46.649
I'm gonna pull Shane
out of there, man.

00:46.684 --> 00:49.079
- It's not too late.
- We still have a choice.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.919
Do you think that Shane
gave Lem a choice?

00:51.954 --> 00:53.047
I'm not Shane.

00:54.599 --> 00:55.695
Where the hell
did you get those Mexicans?

00:55.730 --> 00:57.110
Man, I almost got my dick
shot off.

00:57.145 --> 00:58.079
I tried to call you.

00:58.114 --> 00:59.703
Yeah, Rezian
took my cellphone.

00:59.738 --> 01:00.775
Where you been?

01:00.810 --> 01:02.367
Vic and Ronnie
tried to kill me tonight.

01:02.402 --> 01:04.049
You know,
the worst part is,

01:04.084 --> 01:07.486
is they think I'm too stupid
to even realize it.

01:08.094 --> 01:15.568
Www.1000fr.com presents

01:16.004 --> 01:17.680
this may take a few days.

01:17.715 --> 01:19.736
What about today?

01:19.771 --> 01:21.675
Today I watch my back.

01:22.934 --> 01:25.192
Vic didn't get another crack
at me.

01:26.224 --> 01:27.664
Just be careful, okay?

01:28.070 --> 01:30.991
Always. Come here.

01:31.086 --> 01:32.471
I love you.

01:33.382 --> 01:34.607
So much.

01:40.197 --> 01:41.495
We'll always be together.

01:41.530 --> 01:43.054
All of us.

01:43.598 --> 01:44.512
Bye-bye, buddy.

01:44.547 --> 01:46.125
I love you.

01:47.788 --> 01:48.791
Talk to you later.

01:48.826 --> 01:50.199
Okay.

01:51.030 --> 01:52.406
Bye.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:02.261 --> 02:02.869
Vic.

02:02.904 --> 02:04.556
I wanted to talk to you
outside of the job.

02:04.591 --> 02:07.349
I didn't feel good about the
tone of our last conversation,

02:07.384 --> 02:09.764
especially on my end.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.835
I appreciate the apology,

02:12.216 --> 02:13.643
but if you're interested
in doing the right thing,

02:13.678 --> 02:15.130
you'll relinquish your rights
to Lee.

02:15.165 --> 02:16.866
Can I come in
so we can talk this over?

02:16.901 --> 02:18.745
No, he's about to wake up.

02:18.780 --> 02:20.349
- I've got to feed him.
- I'll make it quick.

02:23.639 --> 02:24.889
This is for him.

02:24.924 --> 02:27.172
It's one of those things
you hang over the crib.

02:27.736 --> 02:29.892
It's supposed to be good
for the hand-eye thing.

02:33.195 --> 02:34.378
Thanks.

02:34.413 --> 02:37.489
Iook, Danny, I don't want us
to be at odds over our boy.

02:37.524 --> 02:40.260
Then sign
the quitclaim form.

02:42.643 --> 02:46.085
Well, you hit me up
with your paperwork,

02:46.120 --> 02:48.165
and I'm just here
to give you a heads-up

02:48.200 --> 02:50.413
I'm about to hit you up
with mine.

02:50.448 --> 02:52.172
Court-ordered DNA test.

02:52.207 --> 02:54.300
I'm pursuing
my legal remedies.

02:54.335 --> 02:54.934
Jesus Christ.

02:54.969 --> 02:56.934
You want to have a kid so bad?

02:56.969 --> 02:58.448
I know a lot of women
who'd like to get knocked up.

02:58.483 --> 03:00.029
I've got things to do.

03:00.676 --> 03:02.012
We can slug it out in court,

03:02.047 --> 03:04.288
spend a lot of time and money
we don't have,

03:04.323 --> 03:06.471
or we can work together
on a plan.

03:06.506 --> 03:09.295
Vic, don't you dare
turn this into something ugly.

03:09.330 --> 03:11.049
I'm just trying to figure out
a way

03:11.084 --> 03:12.207
that we can make an arrangement

03:12.242 --> 03:15.487
that we could both live with
that acknowledges my rights

03:15.522 --> 03:18.590
and my responsibilities
as the father.

03:18.625 --> 03:20.085
That's it.

03:21.245 --> 03:22.324
All right.

03:23.165 --> 03:25.885
Iook, I can pull the court order
at any time between now

03:25.920 --> 03:27.352
and the end of business
tomorrow.

03:29.851 --> 03:32.180
You let me know
how you want to handle it.

03:36.443 --> 03:39.446
Director chaffee, when these
files turned up in my office,

03:39.481 --> 03:42.341
I realized that Cruz Pezuela
was using them

03:42.376 --> 03:44.796
to blackmail
prominent citizens.

03:44.831 --> 03:47.779
Any idea why this anonymously
landed on your doorstep?

03:47.814 --> 03:49.043
I wouldn't want to speculate.

03:49.078 --> 03:52.163
Well, my guess is whoever
was sitting on this got nervous

03:52.198 --> 03:53.378
after the Martin killing,

03:53.413 --> 03:54.842
realized his file was in there,

03:54.877 --> 03:56.697
which could implicate him
in a murder,

03:56.732 --> 03:58.650
wanted to dump
the hot potato.

03:58.685 --> 04:01.541
Mr. Pezuela is one of the biggest
contributors to my campaign,

04:01.576 --> 04:03.732
but that doesn't
buy him any rhythm.

04:03.767 --> 04:05.929
If anything, it obliges me
to bend over backwards

04:05.964 --> 04:07.785
to see that he is brought
to justice.

04:07.820 --> 04:10.025
Rhd has been running
the Martin case.

04:10.060 --> 04:13.698
As lead detective, I'd be open to some sort
of joint investigation here.

04:13.733 --> 04:15.650
Take a look at this.

04:18.536 --> 04:22.224
Armando rios, veteran lieutenant
in the Mexican drug cartel.

04:22.259 --> 04:25.304
We believe the cartel
is using Pezuela as a front

04:25.339 --> 04:27.423
for their California operation.

04:27.458 --> 04:29.191
What are we looking at here,
detective?

04:29.226 --> 04:30.566
I met with rios.

04:30.601 --> 04:33.206
I tried to develop him
as an intel asset.

04:33.241 --> 04:36.116
I was trying to prove your hunch...
connecting him to Pezuela.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.676
When I realized
that Martin's file was in there,

04:38.711 --> 04:40.979
my first impulse was to go
to detective Mackey,

04:41.014 --> 04:44.393
figuring it could be
evidence in a homicide.

04:44.428 --> 04:45.493
So, in point of fact,

04:45.528 --> 04:50.020
you didn't come to I.c.E. First
with these files.

04:50.639 --> 04:53.661
Vic and I thought it could
be managed at a local level.

04:53.696 --> 04:55.486
But after
the Armenian bloodbath,

04:55.521 --> 04:59.542
we both realized that this was
more than Farmington division

04:59.577 --> 05:02.198
- was equipped to handle.
- Right.

05:02.233 --> 05:04.632
You knew this was
an rhd investigation.

05:04.667 --> 05:06.335
You were instructed
to stand down.

05:06.370 --> 05:07.295
I was already hip deep.

05:07.330 --> 05:08.776
I wanted to put
the pieces together

05:08.811 --> 05:10.563
and bring you a package
with a bow on it.

05:10.598 --> 05:11.755
Well, it's pretty clear
detective Mackey

05:11.790 --> 05:13.635
disobeyed a direct order
by meddling,

05:13.670 --> 05:15.064
which we'll deal with
on our end.

05:15.099 --> 05:17.893
That said, if you'd like to embed a
couple of your agents with my team...

05:17.928 --> 05:19.269
this agency will take it
from here.

05:19.304 --> 05:20.995
Sir... sir, my people
are down the line.

05:21.030 --> 05:23.661
- They're ready to go.
- This in an I.c.E. Investigation now.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.008
Hey, you just cost me
a high-profile case,

05:28.043 --> 05:28.738
you little prick.

05:28.773 --> 05:31.484
I'll try to live
with the disappointment.

05:33.184 --> 05:34.311
Thank you.

05:37.276 --> 05:39.998
Well, Vic, it looks like
Pezuela's blackmail box

05:40.033 --> 05:41.960
is finally
someone else's headache.

05:41.995 --> 05:44.359
I thought you wanted to take
down that menudo shitter

05:44.394 --> 05:46.383
so you could get credit
for cleaning up Farmington.

05:46.418 --> 05:48.658
Oh, I intend to.

05:48.693 --> 05:50.793
Plus, kissing I.c.E. Into this
should win me some friends

05:50.828 --> 05:51.850
at a federal level.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.091
Pezuela's gonna grind up
half of I.a.

05:54.126 --> 05:56.786
Before these dipshits come up
with a code name

05:56.821 --> 05:58.340
for their operation.

05:58.375 --> 06:00.805
But I guess as long as thetimes
gets a photo of you

06:00.840 --> 06:03.517
in an I.c.E. Windbreaker,
that's all that really matters, right?

06:03.552 --> 06:05.107
You know, I just handed you
an alibi in there

06:05.142 --> 06:06.708
while you were
on surveillance

06:06.743 --> 06:09.263
jawboning with one
of Pezuela's thugs.

06:09.802 --> 06:11.473
What about Olivia?

06:11.508 --> 06:13.593
Her file's in there.

06:14.093 --> 06:15.647
By giving it back,
you might as well have

06:15.682 --> 06:17.666
pushed her in front
of a freight train.

06:18.853 --> 06:22.239
Yeah, well,
I took out Olivia's file.

06:22.274 --> 06:24.267
You gave it back to her?

06:24.565 --> 06:25.508
No.

06:25.732 --> 06:28.404
But I got it out
of a bad situation.

06:29.948 --> 06:33.075
Bet she can't wait
until that Bill comes due.

06:35.803 --> 06:36.705
How'd it go?

06:36.740 --> 06:39.190
Another Mexican donkey show,

06:39.225 --> 06:41.901
and Aceveda had me playing
the reluctant virgin.

06:42.403 --> 06:45.192
- Seen Shane this morning?
- Not yet.

06:45.227 --> 06:47.768
We're gonna talk about finishing
what we started?

06:47.803 --> 06:49.448
Bad enough
I called an audible

06:49.483 --> 06:50.594
trying to pull Shane
out of there,

06:50.629 --> 06:51.924
and you didn't back my play.

06:51.959 --> 06:53.706
Because you were right
the first time.

06:53.741 --> 06:56.620
Yeah, and now we have no idea
what Shane knows,

06:56.655 --> 06:58.180
what he suspects,
or what he'll do.

06:58.215 --> 07:00.699
On a good day,
this prick's a wild card.

07:00.734 --> 07:04.635
I've known Shane from way back
before the strike team.

07:04.670 --> 07:06.713
He wasn't always like this.

07:06.748 --> 07:07.753
So?

07:07.788 --> 07:10.553
I played a big part
in where he is right now.

07:10.588 --> 07:11.508
I got to own that.

07:11.543 --> 07:14.561
That's why you got to
put him down.

07:15.532 --> 07:18.732
I got a daughter traipsing
around in a French maid's outfit

07:18.767 --> 07:20.212
in front of boys
popping "X."

07:20.247 --> 07:23.244
Is that the way you'd advise me
to deal with her, too, huh?

07:23.279 --> 07:24.379
I'm gonna work with her,

07:24.414 --> 07:26.823
try to get her
going straight again.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.321
And maybe that's what
I have to do to Shane.

07:29.356 --> 07:30.241
I'll fix him, too.

07:30.276 --> 07:32.488
I wish that you could hear
your goddamn rationalizations.

07:32.523 --> 07:35.447
Vic, you need to be downtown
in an hour

07:35.482 --> 07:37.395
for your review board hearing.

07:37.895 --> 07:40.182
That's not... that's not
for another two weeks.

07:40.217 --> 07:41.877
Schedule's moved.
You're up.

07:41.912 --> 07:43.768
Pba rep will meet you there.

07:54.486 --> 07:56.794
Termination without pension,

07:56.829 --> 07:59.529
effective 10 days from now.

07:59.564 --> 08:00.728
Jesus.

08:00.763 --> 08:02.047
What happened?

08:02.082 --> 08:03.863
I didn't have Pezuela's box
to hand them

08:03.898 --> 08:06.279
to offset my shaky jacket.

08:06.314 --> 08:09.701
That bastard, kouf, he's the one
who sealed the deal.

08:09.736 --> 08:12.493
Said I cost him
the Martin investigation.

08:12.528 --> 08:14.451
Didn't follow orders.

08:14.486 --> 08:18.267
Taking down the public face
of the Mexican cartel got you canned?

08:18.302 --> 08:21.979
Apparently, the brass thinks
this asshole shits spumoni.

08:23.866 --> 08:25.106
You're gonna fight this,
right?

08:25.141 --> 08:27.132
- Detective Mackey,
- Jesus, Vic.

08:27.167 --> 08:28.380
We're not done.

08:28.415 --> 08:29.743
In spite of this ruling,

08:29.778 --> 08:31.483
the final determination's
up to the Chief.

08:31.518 --> 08:34.529
Go to your captain, get her
to put in a good word.

08:34.563 --> 08:35.729
I see
you're a married man.

08:35.764 --> 08:38.400
Is your wife pretty?

08:38.436 --> 08:39.243
Beautiful.

08:39.278 --> 08:41.760
You mind if I take her to Vegas
for a dirty weekend,

08:41.796 --> 08:45.840
ride her ass hard
and put her away wet?

08:46.177 --> 08:46.867
What?

08:46.902 --> 08:49.529
Now, that's about the level
of cooperation I can expect

08:49.564 --> 08:53.705
from my captain on anything.

08:54.108 --> 08:59.007
Sync: Vine

09:09.502 --> 09:12.590
Hey, what's this buzz I'm hearing
about them taking your badge?

09:12.625 --> 09:14.524
Done deal. 10 days.

09:14.559 --> 09:16.007
Holy Christ, man.

09:16.042 --> 09:16.862
What are you gonna do?

09:16.897 --> 09:19.931
You doing okay
after that close call?

09:21.439 --> 09:24.357
Yeah, it was a long, dark night
to think about what almost happened.

09:24.392 --> 09:27.222
Just makes you want to
hug your kid and not let go.

09:27.257 --> 09:28.653
You're telling me.

09:28.688 --> 09:30.094
Yeah, thank God I'm
blessed with a wife

09:30.129 --> 09:32.707
- who loves me to death.
- That's right.

09:32.742 --> 09:35.667
So, you want to track down
those mexis

09:35.702 --> 09:36.977
that put me in the middle
of that shooting gallery?

09:37.012 --> 09:37.889
Damn straight.

09:37.924 --> 09:40.665
Let's find out what bullshit
we're facing here first.

09:40.700 --> 09:41.449
What are we looking at?

09:41.484 --> 09:43.833
Ag assault, working girl,
sketchy vitals.

09:43.868 --> 09:45.312
Why'd you dime us?

09:45.347 --> 09:47.669
Strike team has no stake
in a half-dead blow girl.

09:47.704 --> 09:50.117
A co-worker found her,
said she knows you.

09:50.152 --> 09:52.604
What is it
with you and whores?

09:52.639 --> 09:54.545
I was trying to keep them
from tempting you.

09:54.580 --> 09:56.633
We might as well start
getting the cameras going.

09:56.668 --> 09:57.989
Don't work up a sweat.
I'll be quick.

09:58.024 --> 09:59.851
Where's the chickenhead?

09:59.886 --> 10:01.754
This pretty lady
waiting right there.

10:03.734 --> 10:05.543
Hey, baby.

10:05.578 --> 10:07.231
You're upset.

10:08.381 --> 10:09.533
Vic.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.319
It's me. Farrah.

10:15.878 --> 10:17.655
Holy Jesus Christ.

10:17.690 --> 10:19.317
You've got to get the guy
who did this.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.757
It was bombay, our pimp.

10:20.792 --> 10:23.893
A hooker scoring a beat down
is below my pay grade.

10:23.928 --> 10:25.855
A friend of yours
is even lower.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.060
Am and I were getting clean
for each other.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.950
That's why bombay did this.

10:30.985 --> 10:32.359
He'll be coming for me next.

10:32.394 --> 10:33.648
You had your chance.

10:33.683 --> 10:35.385
I gave you a bus ticket
out of the life.

10:35.420 --> 10:37.529
Instead of doing the smart
thing, you played me.

10:37.564 --> 10:40.993
- Why are you mad at me, Vic?
- I don't give a rat's ass about you, lady!

10:41.028 --> 10:43.399
Did bad shit
go down between us?

10:43.434 --> 10:44.664
I don't... I don't rember.

10:44.699 --> 10:47.839
You don't remember whose cock you
gagged on this morning, either.

10:47.874 --> 10:49.383
I'm not like that anymore.

10:49.418 --> 10:51.311
Amber and me had two weeks
without using.

10:51.346 --> 10:52.723
We're going to meetings
and everything.

10:52.758 --> 10:55.499
Hey, Vic, the emts
just pronounced her.

10:55.534 --> 10:57.555
She... she's dead?

10:57.590 --> 10:59.723
Oh, my God. Oh, my...

10:59.758 --> 11:01.898
you've got to catch
the guy who did this.

11:01.933 --> 11:04.674
Please, Vic. Please, Vic.

11:09.119 --> 11:11.791
Get this skank on record
and get her out of here.

11:11.826 --> 11:13.463
I thought you were gonna
help me.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.384
I accidently touched you,

11:15.419 --> 11:17.040
and I haven't had a tetanus shot
in a while.

11:17.075 --> 11:19.801
My girl gets murdered
and you don't give a shit?

11:19.836 --> 11:22.748
- Don't care I'm next?
- By me, that's euthanasia.

11:22.783 --> 11:23.918
Vic.

11:23.953 --> 11:26.270
I've already been down the road
with this slut.

11:26.305 --> 11:28.014
Her mouth is only good
for two things,

11:28.049 --> 11:30.726
and one of them's
lying through her teeth.

11:30.761 --> 11:32.538
I need help, Vic!

11:36.109 --> 11:37.180
Have a seat.

11:38.229 --> 11:40.371
When was the last time
you saw Amber?

11:40.406 --> 11:41.827
Yesterday.

11:42.444 --> 11:44.026
She works nights.

11:44.061 --> 11:45.074
The manager
at the liquor spot

11:45.109 --> 11:47.898
lets her clean up in the back sink
on the way home from the stroll.

11:47.933 --> 11:51.244
Usually gets to the car about
the time the sun comes up.

11:51.279 --> 11:53.844
When she didn't show,
I knew something was bad.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.026
You told Vic
you know who did it.

11:56.061 --> 11:57.379
Damn straight.

11:57.414 --> 11:58.636
Our pimp, bombay.

11:58.671 --> 11:59.809
How do you know it was him?

11:59.844 --> 12:02.185
'Cause he said he was gonna.

12:02.672 --> 12:04.196
Bombay turns you out,

12:04.231 --> 12:06.401
puts you on the track,

12:06.436 --> 12:07.505
you don't leave.

12:07.540 --> 12:08.913
Where's bombay
get his drugs?

12:08.948 --> 12:10.576
Manufactures them.

12:10.840 --> 12:12.592
Crystal's the main gig.

12:12.627 --> 12:14.255
Running bitches is just a hobby.

12:14.290 --> 12:17.984
Said it's like
owning race horses.

12:23.127 --> 12:24.735
I trusted you.

12:24.770 --> 12:27.310
Now I find you had Pezuela's box
the whole time.

12:27.345 --> 12:29.687
Yeah, I had the box,

12:29.722 --> 12:31.007
and you were in it.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.119
I had to make sure
I could trust you.

12:33.154 --> 12:34.793
And I lost the box
to Aceveda,

12:34.828 --> 12:37.561
and he flipped it over to your
boss against my objections.

12:37.596 --> 12:39.330
Know a good trial attorney?

12:39.365 --> 12:42.533
Aceveda pulled your file
before he turned it over.

12:42.568 --> 12:43.389
Why?

12:43.424 --> 12:44.573
One side of his mouth,

12:44.608 --> 12:45.613
he would call it a good deed.

12:45.648 --> 12:48.074
The other would call it
leverage over you

12:48.109 --> 12:50.323
for favors
to be named later.

12:50.358 --> 12:52.918
So I've traded one blackmailer
for another?

12:52.953 --> 12:54.654
You're been granted
a reprieve.

12:54.689 --> 12:56.493
That's all that matters
right now.

12:56.952 --> 12:59.322
My here and now is how
to bring down Pezuela

12:59.357 --> 13:00.842
in the 10 days
I still have a badge

13:00.877 --> 13:01.977
because there's no way in hell

13:02.012 --> 13:04.827
the geniuses in your agency
are up for the job.

13:04.862 --> 13:07.345
Chaffee's making this case
a priority.

13:07.380 --> 13:08.977
Whatever that means.

13:09.618 --> 13:11.366
Rios has disappeared.

13:11.401 --> 13:12.889
Pezuela's insulated.

13:12.924 --> 13:14.272
He knows there's heat.

13:15.032 --> 13:16.919
You need someone
on the inside,

13:16.954 --> 13:18.904
and that only means me.

13:18.939 --> 13:20.271
Chaffee will never
go for it.

13:20.306 --> 13:21.432
Far as he's concerned,

13:21.467 --> 13:23.455
local cops are either
incompetent or dirty.

13:23.490 --> 13:25.774
Really?
What's his plan, then?

13:27.806 --> 13:30.245
He's gonna raid Pezuela's
construction site today.

13:30.280 --> 13:31.398
Iooking for what?

13:31.433 --> 13:34.058
Surveillance has rios going into
that job site two days ago.

13:34.093 --> 13:35.817
He was never witnessed
coming out.

13:35.852 --> 13:37.224
We find a body,

13:37.259 --> 13:39.703
chaffee goes after Pezuela
on conspiracy homicide.

13:39.738 --> 13:40.959
You're not gonna find a body.

13:40.994 --> 13:41.626
Trust me.

13:41.661 --> 13:43.329
And the only thing
this raid is gonna do

13:43.364 --> 13:45.515
is send Pezuela scurrying
for his bunker.

13:45.550 --> 13:47.514
You have to stop it.

13:47.549 --> 13:49.105
I could tip Pezuela off,

13:49.140 --> 13:52.049
keep alive the fiction
he's still got a hook in me.

13:59.402 --> 14:02.477
I got a way
we can both curry some favor.

14:04.017 --> 14:04.867
By the end of business,

14:04.902 --> 14:07.486
the feds are gonna be crawling
all over this place.

14:07.521 --> 14:08.965
Where did you get
the information?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.638
I got a real deep throat
in d.c.,

14:11.673 --> 14:16.207
tipped me the local office is
waiting on approval to move forward.

14:16.590 --> 14:18.731
A local cop
with federal reach.

14:18.766 --> 14:21.098
Well, when you're a grower
not a shower,

14:21.133 --> 14:24.449
it helps to have a deep throat
with no gag reflex.

14:25.223 --> 14:28.935
And if your information
should have some merit?

14:28.970 --> 14:32.688
Then we should start talking
about a promotion and a raise.

14:32.723 --> 14:34.690
I had another thought.

14:38.449 --> 14:40.355
This week's pay
and severance.

14:40.390 --> 14:42.317
You haven't found
my missing box,

14:42.352 --> 14:43.737
and in 10 days,

14:43.772 --> 14:45.520
you won't have a badge.

14:45.555 --> 14:46.436
You're no use to me.

14:46.471 --> 14:49.283
Hey, I handed you
the armenians on a platter,

14:49.318 --> 14:51.221
and I'm telling you the feds
are about to show up here,

14:51.256 --> 14:52.332
pry your mouth open,

14:52.367 --> 14:54.174
and take a big, long piss.

14:54.209 --> 14:56.458
What have you done
for me lately?

14:56.493 --> 14:58.944
Listen, here, I have kids.

14:58.979 --> 15:00.369
I'm about to lose my job.

15:00.404 --> 15:02.384
L- I'm scrambling.

15:02.419 --> 15:04.521
Our business is done.

15:10.923 --> 15:13.536
I was in my room
getting ready for work

15:13.571 --> 15:14.822
when someone tried to break in.

15:14.857 --> 15:16.960
I heard the glass, got scared,

15:16.995 --> 15:17.959
and went for my gun.

15:17.994 --> 15:19.743
Did you get a look at
the intruder before you fired?

15:19.778 --> 15:20.816
Not really.

15:20.851 --> 15:23.007
I yelled, "I have a gun."

15:23.042 --> 15:24.887
I was just trying to scare him,

15:24.922 --> 15:27.319
but I think
I might have shot him.

15:27.354 --> 15:28.663
So you probably
couldn't identify him

15:28.698 --> 15:29.818
if you saw him again.

15:30.834 --> 15:32.541
You live here alone?

15:32.576 --> 15:35.060
Yeah. This area was supposed
to be on the way up.

15:35.095 --> 15:38.075
I was gonna flip the house
like on those infomercials.

15:39.945 --> 15:41.579
Do me a favor
and finish up.

15:41.614 --> 15:42.514
Why?

15:42.549 --> 15:43.908
Claudette's house
is five doors down.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.149
I want to go over
and check it out.

15:45.184 --> 15:45.788
Thanks.

15:46.099 --> 15:47.871
All right, no problem.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.739
That's what partners
are for, right?

15:54.166 --> 15:56.027
This is Claudette.
Leave a message.

15:56.062 --> 15:58.761
Hey, Claudette,
are you there?

15:58.796 --> 15:59.759
Pick up.

15:59.794 --> 16:01.584
I, uh, see your car here.

16:01.619 --> 16:04.071
I'm, uh, I'm walking up
your front steps.

16:04.106 --> 16:05.686
Pick up.

16:06.212 --> 16:07.836
Hello? Hello? Hello?

16:07.871 --> 16:10.955
That's me knocking.

16:10.990 --> 16:12.657
Oh, shit.

16:13.314 --> 16:14.936
Claudette?!

16:26.485 --> 16:27.794
Claudette?!

16:28.790 --> 16:30.529
Hello?! Claudette?!

16:30.905 --> 16:32.296
Claudette?!

16:39.942 --> 16:41.586
Whatever dance
you and Vic got going on,

16:41.621 --> 16:43.034
I don't want
to be a part of it.

16:43.069 --> 16:46.503
Vic is taking me to court to
prove that he's my son's father.

16:46.538 --> 16:48.300
I don't want him
in our lives.

16:48.335 --> 16:50.050
Period.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.663
I don't even want
child support, okay?

16:52.698 --> 16:54.743
And on a cop's salary?

16:54.778 --> 16:56.582
I can't imagine
you want him paying money

16:56.617 --> 16:59.094
that should be going
to you and your kids.

16:59.665 --> 17:01.709
What exactlydoyou want?

17:01.744 --> 17:05.628
I want sole custody
and no visitation rights.

17:05.664 --> 17:07.294
But the thing is,
to get that,

17:07.329 --> 17:10.335
I have to make a case to the
judge that he's an unfit parent.

17:10.369 --> 17:11.685
Well, Vic may be
a lot of things,

17:11.720 --> 17:13.291
but he cares about his kids.

17:13.327 --> 17:15.423
Yeah, well, when Cassidy came
to my house the other day,

17:15.458 --> 17:17.448
she had a different take
on it.

17:18.102 --> 17:18.929
Okay, sorry.

17:18.964 --> 17:20.115
It's not my business, all right.

17:20.150 --> 17:21.343
It's why I called you
to come get her,

17:21.377 --> 17:23.901
but leeismy business.

17:25.819 --> 17:28.295
Come on, you know this guy
better than anybody,

17:28.329 --> 17:30.957
and with Vic, it's all
about him all the time.

17:30.992 --> 17:34.492
What good does it do my kids
to drag their father's

17:34.527 --> 17:36.502
dirty laundry into a courtroom?

17:36.537 --> 17:39.884
Just tell your side of things
to the judge, okay?

17:39.919 --> 17:41.231
The records
are gonna be sealed.

17:41.266 --> 17:43.230
They never even have to know.

17:43.923 --> 17:46.322
Corrine, don't even think
about it as a favor to me.

17:46.357 --> 17:48.851
Think about it as a long-term
business decision

17:48.886 --> 17:52.005
in the best interest
of your kids.

17:54.368 --> 17:55.464
Hey.

17:55.499 --> 17:57.842
Crime scene's this house,
not mine.

17:57.877 --> 17:59.612
All this excitement
right down the block from you.

17:59.647 --> 18:02.499
L- I saw your car
in the driveway.

18:02.534 --> 18:03.579
Alternator trouble.

18:03.614 --> 18:05.910
Black and white gave me a lift
to work this morning,

18:05.945 --> 18:07.214
and then the neighbors
starting calling,

18:07.249 --> 18:09.805
which is why I want you
to clear this pronto.

18:09.840 --> 18:10.869
Okay.

18:11.141 --> 18:12.524
See you back at the Barn.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.719
Vinnie's found blood
around the side of the house.

18:14.754 --> 18:17.109
Iooks like Annie oakley
winged the guy.

18:17.144 --> 18:18.650
Let's get a sample.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.187
Tried to get a reading
on Shane.

18:24.677 --> 18:26.689
Iooks like he might be
all right.

18:26.724 --> 18:28.312
As long as he's alive,

18:28.347 --> 18:30.977
we're not all right.

18:31.012 --> 18:32.224
What about saving your badge?

18:32.259 --> 18:33.492
Any ideas?

18:35.104 --> 18:36.743
A squeaking noise like that,

18:36.778 --> 18:39.510
you probably want to check
your fan belt.

18:40.581 --> 18:42.133
I hear you'll be moving on.

18:42.168 --> 18:44.904
You still got me
for another week and a half.

18:44.939 --> 18:46.082
I'll make a deal with you.

18:46.117 --> 18:48.266
You clean out your locker
and leave today

18:48.301 --> 18:49.962
and I'll go personally
to the Chief

18:49.997 --> 18:53.032
and get a piece
of your pension restored.

18:58.318 --> 19:02.718
I, uh, still got
a few loose ends to tie up.

19:02.753 --> 19:05.399
I'll stick around, thanks.

19:06.935 --> 19:07.679
In that case,

19:07.714 --> 19:10.453
I want your people deployed
on this working-girl murder.

19:10.488 --> 19:12.002
You want
the strike team on pimp patrol?

19:12.037 --> 19:14.456
In addition to murder,
this guy also manufactures

19:14.491 --> 19:16.049
and moves meth in quantity,

19:16.084 --> 19:17.648
which if memory serves,

19:17.683 --> 19:21.406
is one of the hot spots you people
are supposed to be on top of.

19:21.772 --> 19:24.438
Bombay's government name
is marcel letourneau.

19:24.473 --> 19:26.023
Ran his priors, no address.

19:26.058 --> 19:27.581
The girl didn't have
a twenty on him.

19:27.616 --> 19:28.510
Get ready for a long,

19:28.545 --> 19:30.463
lazy afternoon on the stroll,

19:30.498 --> 19:32.990
turning down free bjs
while we look for this idiot.

19:33.025 --> 19:35.116
Who said anything
about turning them down?

19:35.151 --> 19:35.815
Count me in.

19:35.850 --> 19:38.329
Farrah did have info
on one of bombay's new earners.

19:38.364 --> 19:39.633
Calls herself capuchina.

19:39.668 --> 19:42.790
She probably stole farrah's
crown as bottom bitch.

19:42.825 --> 19:44.374
Why wouldn't she
rat her out?

19:44.409 --> 19:45.141
Anything else?

19:45.176 --> 19:46.572
Pretty much it.

19:46.607 --> 19:48.285
Waiting on forensics.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.267
Shane and I will meet and greet
with capuchina.

19:50.302 --> 19:51.183
You guys hang tight.

19:51.218 --> 19:52.469
Stay on the lab rats.

19:52.504 --> 19:55.252
Let's do it.

19:55.287 --> 19:57.352
I'll catch up
with you outside.

20:01.483 --> 20:02.703
Come over here.

20:02.738 --> 20:04.647
What's going on?

20:04.682 --> 20:06.918
Danny came to see me.

20:06.953 --> 20:08.164
What did she want?

20:08.199 --> 20:09.277
First, why don't you tell me

20:09.312 --> 20:11.172
why you want joint custody?

20:11.207 --> 20:12.487
You don't have to worry
about any of that.

20:12.522 --> 20:14.021
Tell me...
I'll stop worrying.

20:14.056 --> 20:15.900
Why do you want
shared custody?

20:15.935 --> 20:17.805
Because I have
shared responsibility.

20:17.840 --> 20:19.555
That's bullshit, Vic.

20:19.590 --> 20:21.202
You've had 14 years

20:21.237 --> 20:23.594
to be the most important part
of Cassidy's life.

20:23.629 --> 20:26.226
Never once has she been
your top priority.

20:26.261 --> 20:27.959
Given where she is
in her life right now,

20:27.994 --> 20:29.895
I'd do things differently.

20:29.930 --> 20:32.631
I don't want to make
the same mistake with Lee.

20:32.666 --> 20:33.951
This baby gives you
a do-over?

20:33.986 --> 20:36.325
How can I be an example
to our three kids,

20:36.360 --> 20:37.246
look them in the eye,

20:37.281 --> 20:39.588
if I just walk away
from this other child?

20:39.623 --> 20:41.173
I mean, they know about him,
for Christ's sake.

20:41.208 --> 20:43.551
How can I prove to Cassidy
that I love her

20:43.586 --> 20:46.481
if I won't even fight
for my son?

20:46.516 --> 20:48.481
Now, goddamn it,
what did Danny want?

20:48.516 --> 20:50.201
You out of the picture.

20:50.707 --> 20:53.127
She wants me to help her
to make a case

20:53.162 --> 20:56.599
that you're not fit
to even see this kid.

20:56.954 --> 20:58.230
Are you signing on?

20:58.265 --> 21:00.439
I know why you think
you want this,

21:00.474 --> 21:02.546
but you need to ask yourself if

21:02.581 --> 21:03.838
you're just putting up a fight

21:03.873 --> 21:05.125
just because
you're a fighter

21:05.160 --> 21:07.996
or if this is what's best
for this kid.

21:08.031 --> 21:10.203
- You don't...
- and before you answer,

21:11.139 --> 21:13.522
just sit with the question.

21:35.421 --> 21:36.576
What's up?

21:36.611 --> 21:39.417
Shit can jump off
with these 187 cats, man.

21:47.327 --> 21:48.494
Detective,

21:48.495 --> 21:50.790
do you smell the sickly sweet odor
ofcannabis sativa?

21:50.825 --> 21:52.878
- Yes, indeed I do.
- Yep.

21:54.793 --> 21:55.917
Sit down.

21:57.571 --> 21:58.522
Bag of skunk,

21:58.557 --> 22:00.237
drug paraphernalia,

22:01.020 --> 22:02.389
undisclosed earnings.

22:02.424 --> 22:03.862
Possession
of a concealed weapon.

22:03.897 --> 22:05.566
Jesus Christ.

22:05.601 --> 22:07.014
I keep that around
for protection.

22:07.049 --> 22:10.245
One of my regulars likes me
to use it on his nuts.

22:10.280 --> 22:11.584
Who could blame him?

22:12.828 --> 22:13.798
What do you boys want?

22:13.833 --> 22:15.150
We want to find bombay.

22:15.185 --> 22:17.438
That Gray bitch turned you
on to me, didn't she?

22:18.301 --> 22:19.692
What do you know
about farrah?

22:20.800 --> 22:22.623
Bitch couldn't handle
her business.

22:22.658 --> 22:24.799
Chose the white smoke
over her black pimp.

22:24.834 --> 22:26.590
Bitch is paying the price now.

22:26.625 --> 22:28.893
Word on the street is bombay
murdered her squeeze.

22:28.928 --> 22:30.508
Shit, white farrah
ain't right in the mind...

22:30.543 --> 22:31.732
why she got kicked to the curb.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.211
I'm down for mine.

22:33.246 --> 22:33.775
Got vision.

22:33.810 --> 22:35.415
Run bitches on my own one day,

22:35.450 --> 22:36.626
be an entrepreneur.

22:36.661 --> 22:37.962
Well,
you help us find bombay,

22:37.997 --> 22:40.040
and we'll sponsor you
for the rotary club.

22:40.075 --> 22:42.399
Baby, I don't do anal.

22:42.434 --> 22:44.405
What about bondage?

22:44.440 --> 22:47.453
Now you can add obstructing
a police investigation to the list.

22:47.488 --> 22:48.981
I swear that nigga only come
around here

22:49.016 --> 22:50.861
to hit my shit
and hold his paper.

22:50.896 --> 22:52.984
- Stop fighting me.
- Two-man will know where he's at!

22:53.019 --> 22:54.379
- Who's two-man?
- His boy...

22:54.414 --> 22:56.300
- collects his dope money.
- Where do we find him?

22:56.335 --> 22:57.892
- I don't know.
- What's he look like?

22:57.927 --> 22:59.943
Big, ugly,
black as a flat tire.

22:59.978 --> 23:01.502
Puts a hurt on folks
who can't pay.

23:01.537 --> 23:02.449
Man, talk to farrah.

23:02.484 --> 23:03.809
She'll know where two-man's at.

23:03.844 --> 23:05.631
Word, if I knew anything else,

23:05.666 --> 23:08.222
I'd tell y'all
'cause I don't love county.

23:09.319 --> 23:11.462
Two-man collects in the jungles
every mother's day...

23:12.206 --> 23:14.737
when the county checks
come in.

23:15.340 --> 23:16.302
That's his car.

23:16.337 --> 23:18.174
Ronnie,
suspect vehicle's on your left.

23:18.209 --> 23:19.100
Pull over where you can.

23:19.135 --> 23:19.803
Got it.

23:19.838 --> 23:21.153
So how come you didn't turn us
on to this guy

23:21.188 --> 23:22.970
when we interviewed you
back at the Barn?

23:23.005 --> 23:23.754
I don't know.

23:23.789 --> 23:25.044
I didn't think of it.

23:25.079 --> 23:27.762
Wasn't sure if he's still
working for bombay.

23:29.321 --> 23:32.482
Now, we are gonna sit here
until this guy shows up,

23:32.517 --> 23:33.729
and you're gonna point him
out to us.

23:33.764 --> 23:35.745
- When are we gonna...
- until then, we're gonna keep

23:35.780 --> 23:37.293
talking to a minimum.

23:39.092 --> 23:42.833
There's been a 15% increase in
b and E's the last three months

23:42.868 --> 23:43.864
in Claudette's neighborhood,

23:43.899 --> 23:46.088
mostly electronics and jewelry.

23:46.123 --> 23:48.711
A couple private security
companies working that area now.

23:48.746 --> 23:50.045
Figured they're worth
a conversation.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.087
Rent-a-cops?

23:51.122 --> 23:52.591
More like rent an ex-cop.

23:52.626 --> 23:55.280
Prp protection is owned by guys
who used to be on the job.

23:56.067 --> 23:56.954
We should call over.

23:56.989 --> 23:58.641
Maybe one of their patrols
saw something.

23:58.676 --> 24:00.609
Way ahead of you, Dutch man.

24:00.644 --> 24:04.131
As a matter of fact,
this must be my guy.

24:04.166 --> 24:06.257
Lester,
thanks for coming in.

24:06.292 --> 24:06.914
Are you kidding me?

24:06.949 --> 24:08.153
Happy to help.

24:08.188 --> 24:09.025
Say hi to Dutch Wagenbach.

24:09.060 --> 24:09.949
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:10.600 --> 24:13.467
So, ex-cops running
a security company.

24:13.502 --> 24:14.361
It's genius.

24:14.396 --> 24:15.570
I think I see my future.

24:15.605 --> 24:17.041
I recognized an opportunity...

24:17.076 --> 24:18.001
no-brainer, really.

24:18.036 --> 24:19.569
I got
a business bone myself.

24:19.604 --> 24:20.560
What are you into?

24:20.595 --> 24:22.802
Most recently vending machines,

24:22.837 --> 24:24.093
not the cheap stuff...
high-end,

24:24.128 --> 24:25.412
gourmet food and beverages.

24:25.447 --> 24:26.092
Good money there?

24:26.127 --> 24:27.859
Oh.

24:28.588 --> 24:29.778
It's not bad.

24:31.245 --> 24:32.696
So, what can I do
for you guys?

24:32.731 --> 24:35.751
Uh, recent increase in b and E's
in your service area...

24:35.786 --> 24:36.732
what do you make of it?

24:36.767 --> 24:37.691
Gentrification.

24:37.726 --> 24:38.938
You got
white people moving in

24:38.973 --> 24:40.081
'cause the real estate's
cheaper,

24:40.116 --> 24:41.420
and they bring better gear
to steal.

24:41.455 --> 24:42.799
For the blacks and Mexicans,

24:42.834 --> 24:45.147
it's a crowbar Christmas.

24:45.182 --> 24:47.330
Company logs and files
for the past three months.

24:47.365 --> 24:49.385
It's a general who's who
and what's what

24:49.420 --> 24:51.560
of crimes that we responded to
in the area.

24:51.595 --> 24:53.994
I'd take a look at a couple
of troublemakers in particular.

24:54.029 --> 24:57.249
Elliott gallardo... he's
a recently paroled crackhead,

24:57.284 --> 24:58.641
lives in the area.

24:58.676 --> 25:00.032
The other guys's
called paolo.

25:00.067 --> 25:02.199
He owns the luxury pawn shop
down on sixth.

25:02.234 --> 25:04.521
Got an interesting way
of compensating

25:04.556 --> 25:05.689
for his low inventory.

25:05.724 --> 25:07.707
You gonna break
this whole thing on your own?

25:09.884 --> 25:10.418
Here's a new one.

25:10.453 --> 25:11.802
White shirt coming out the gate.

25:11.837 --> 25:13.058
That's him right there.

25:13.093 --> 25:15.051
It's two-man.

25:15.749 --> 25:16.704
Stay in the car.

25:16.739 --> 25:18.443
Try to keep your clothes on.

25:26.437 --> 25:28.592
Stop! Police!

25:29.401 --> 25:30.504
Look out!

25:30.772 --> 25:32.851
The court! Cut him off!

25:33.918 --> 25:35.615
Shane, wake up, brother!

25:35.650 --> 25:36.987
Up and at 'em!

25:46.645 --> 25:48.036
Yo, watch out, man.

25:58.297 --> 25:59.566
Take it easy!

25:59.614 --> 26:00.819
Take it easy!

26:00.854 --> 26:02.034
Hey!

26:02.188 --> 26:03.144
Shut your hole.

26:03.179 --> 26:04.560
Don't move.

26:05.925 --> 26:07.509
We're looking
for bombay letourneau.

26:07.544 --> 26:08.244
Who?

26:08.279 --> 26:09.875
How's that?

26:10.480 --> 26:13.705
I understand you do this for
a living, except to girls.

26:13.740 --> 26:17.361
If anybody feels the need to
write me up for excessive force,

26:17.396 --> 26:19.228
you better do it
in the next 10 days.

26:19.263 --> 26:21.096
You gonna break it!

26:21.563 --> 26:23.200
Get up! Get up!

26:23.235 --> 26:24.137
Up!

26:25.535 --> 26:26.934
Give me your hand.

26:33.382 --> 26:34.511
Tell us where he is.

26:34.546 --> 26:36.492
We'll forget all about
this track-and-field tryout,

26:36.527 --> 26:38.350
and you get to keep this.

26:38.385 --> 26:40.138
That grip belong to bombay.

26:40.173 --> 26:43.155
Well, he won't be
needing that anymore.

26:44.824 --> 26:47.262
He got a new cook-up spot
in the dust bowl

26:47.297 --> 26:49.796
off the five
in glassell park.

26:51.108 --> 26:53.357
I think he broke
my goddamn jaw, man.

26:53.392 --> 26:55.815
You broke your own jaw,
asshole.

27:00.074 --> 27:01.217
Smells like cat piss.

27:01.252 --> 27:02.463
Means they're in the
middle of a cook-up.

27:02.498 --> 27:03.675
We could probably
catch him off guard.

27:03.710 --> 27:04.982
So, do we wait
for uni backup?

27:05.017 --> 27:06.575
We take him hard to the paint,

27:06.610 --> 27:08.099
they won't know what hit them.

27:08.134 --> 27:12.021
Vic, connie was always saying
you were nice,

27:12.056 --> 27:13.785
how you helped her.

27:13.820 --> 27:16.532
Whatever I did to make you mad,
I'm sorry.

27:16.567 --> 27:18.100
My life's different now.

27:18.135 --> 27:18.960
Yeah, mine too.

27:18.995 --> 27:20.996
Four or five people
in the main trailer.

27:21.031 --> 27:22.124
I don't know
about the other one.

27:22.159 --> 27:23.360
We go in, roust everyone,

27:23.395 --> 27:25.627
little miss claptrap
ID's our bad guy.

27:25.662 --> 27:27.714
You stay here
and keep your mouth shut

27:27.749 --> 27:29.766
until we need you to eyeball
mack daddy.

27:29.801 --> 27:30.910
Come on.

27:31.694 --> 27:33.238
Be careful.

27:59.648 --> 28:00.765
Suspect down!

28:00.800 --> 28:01.848
Get out of there!

28:01.883 --> 28:03.144
Get out of the trailer!

28:03.179 --> 28:04.405
Let's go right now!

28:05.884 --> 28:07.328
Get against the wall.

28:07.734 --> 28:09.259
Spread 'em against the wall.

28:12.642 --> 28:13.625
Clear!

28:13.660 --> 28:15.731
- Ronnie, you got that?
- Clear! Get out of here!

28:15.766 --> 28:17.916
Julien, clear that other
structure!

28:18.282 --> 28:19.266
Clear!

28:22.468 --> 28:23.626
I did what I had to do.

28:23.661 --> 28:25.204
You fellas took a few rounds.

28:25.239 --> 28:26.712
I only returned two shots.

28:26.747 --> 28:28.602
Okay, I don't want you
talking to anyone.

28:28.637 --> 28:29.758
O.I.s. Is on its way.

28:29.793 --> 28:31.763
I want you to contact
protective league.

28:31.798 --> 28:33.722
Get a rep standing by, okay?

28:33.757 --> 28:35.653
I.A.D. Will take your formal
statement at the Barn.

28:35.688 --> 28:37.923
I'll take possession
of your weapon.

28:39.003 --> 28:39.843
It'll be all right.

28:39.878 --> 28:41.236
One of you guys get him back.

28:41.271 --> 28:42.656
Glad I stuck around.

28:42.691 --> 28:45.184
Might even pick up a letter
of commendation for this one.

28:45.219 --> 28:47.166
Iooks good in the jacket.

28:47.201 --> 28:49.114
Raise my rate next gig.

28:52.044 --> 28:53.151
We appreciate all the help.

28:53.186 --> 28:54.755
Hey, just doing my part
as a citizen.

28:54.790 --> 28:56.325
I point them out,
you put them away.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.231
That sounds like a plan.

28:57.266 --> 28:58.396
Thanks.

29:13.132 --> 29:14.876
Hey, Danny,
you got a minute?

29:15.295 --> 29:16.899
What's up?

29:17.917 --> 29:19.222
Danielle Sofer?

29:19.893 --> 29:20.713
Yeah.

29:20.748 --> 29:22.956
You are hereby ordered
to appear in family court

29:22.991 --> 29:24.084
on the date indicated.

29:24.119 --> 29:25.872
Have a good day.

29:30.459 --> 29:32.679
You son of a bitch.

29:32.714 --> 29:34.903
You told me I had
until tomorrow night.

29:34.938 --> 29:37.093
That was before
you went behind my back

29:37.128 --> 29:39.256
and dragged Corrine
into this.

29:39.291 --> 29:41.430
Shredding another family
for your own agenda

29:41.465 --> 29:44.999
isn't gonna win you "world's
best mom" in a courtroom.

29:45.034 --> 29:46.652
Guess we do this
the hard way.

29:46.687 --> 29:48.920
After all the shit you pulled
Corrine through,

29:48.955 --> 29:51.426
she comes crawling back to you
like a whipped puppy.

29:51.461 --> 29:52.319
Jesus Christ,

29:52.354 --> 29:55.361
what kind of hold do you have
on that poor woman anyway?

29:55.396 --> 29:58.924
She understands
a basic human concept...

29:59.771 --> 30:01.274
children need fathers.

30:01.309 --> 30:02.723
Now, I'm not gonna
let you puzzle

30:02.758 --> 30:05.070
over that little brain teaser
one more day

30:05.105 --> 30:07.409
at my son's expense.

30:19.843 --> 30:22.154
You missed one hell of a show
at Pezuela's place.

30:22.189 --> 30:24.612
Two helicopters with
thermographic display,

30:24.647 --> 30:27.036
field command module
with satellite uplink,

30:27.071 --> 30:28.768
two dozen agents,
canine team,

30:28.803 --> 30:30.536
and a posse
of forensic accountants.

30:30.571 --> 30:33.163
And your boss came up
with Jack shit and no body.

30:33.198 --> 30:35.270
Your tax dollars at work.

30:35.305 --> 30:36.901
Chaffee walked himself
out onto a limb

30:36.936 --> 30:38.498
with the big boys in d.c.
On this one.

30:38.533 --> 30:40.657
And the limb just snapped.

30:41.255 --> 30:43.556
When can you get me into a room
with chaffee?

30:43.591 --> 30:45.313
I'll find out.

30:45.987 --> 30:47.043
Hey, Vic.

30:47.078 --> 30:49.645
There was a guy here earlier,
Lester spirakus... ex-cop.

30:49.680 --> 30:50.203
You know him?

30:50.238 --> 30:52.187
I've seen him around. Why?

30:52.222 --> 30:54.420
I got a sense you two
had some history.

30:54.455 --> 30:56.584
Good ob. You should be
a detective.

30:56.619 --> 30:59.427
Guy's an asshole,
into all kinds of wrong shit.

30:59.462 --> 31:00.551
Really?

31:01.061 --> 31:02.466
What did he do now?

31:02.501 --> 31:03.837
Well, maybe nothing.

31:03.872 --> 31:05.720
If you think
he did something shitty,

31:05.755 --> 31:07.783
he probably did.

31:09.223 --> 31:12.424
Captain, I need signatures
on last week's o.t. Reports.

31:14.260 --> 31:17.579
I couldn't help catching
you and Vic square off earlier.

31:17.954 --> 31:20.161
Sorry about that.
It won't happen again.

31:20.196 --> 31:22.058
Is that a promise
you can keep?

31:22.093 --> 31:23.130
Probably not.

31:23.165 --> 31:24.948
And not even
for the next 10 days?

31:24.983 --> 31:26.813
Vic's being terminated.

31:26.848 --> 31:28.643
He'll be gone after that.

31:29.233 --> 31:30.298
Wow.

31:30.333 --> 31:31.689
I don't mean
to insert myself,

31:31.724 --> 31:34.181
but if I've got a personnel
problem on my hands,

31:34.216 --> 31:36.717
even a short-term, I'd like
to know what I'm dealing with.

31:39.096 --> 31:41.142
Captain, it's not
a secret around here.

31:41.177 --> 31:43.188
I mean, everybody knows
Vic is the father.

31:43.223 --> 31:44.472
I've heard rumors.

31:44.507 --> 31:45.991
I tried to keep him
out of the mix.

31:46.026 --> 31:47.672
It's just that things
have gotten really messy.

31:47.707 --> 31:51.249
You ought to know that that's
the book on Vic going in.

31:51.284 --> 31:53.025
Right.

31:53.060 --> 31:55.335
I think I was just focused
on the baby of it all.

31:55.370 --> 31:56.887
Take whatever time you need.

31:56.922 --> 31:58.682
Handle your business.

31:59.769 --> 32:01.768
I don't want to leave you
in the lurch.

32:01.803 --> 32:03.761
I can look out for myself,

32:03.796 --> 32:05.720
and you should do the same.

32:07.564 --> 32:09.142
Talked to elliott the crackhead.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.132
Alibi checks out.

32:10.167 --> 32:12.574
Four people saw him stealing food
from the soup kitchen this morning.

32:12.609 --> 32:14.110
How do you steal
from a soup kitchen?

32:14.145 --> 32:15.651
That was his argument.

32:15.686 --> 32:16.988
How about we head over
to the pawn shop,

32:17.023 --> 32:17.815
perform a three-ball squeeze?

32:17.850 --> 32:20.104
Hey, maybe we've been going
in the wrong direction.

32:20.139 --> 32:21.264
What about Lester?

32:21.299 --> 32:22.355
That's a good one.

32:22.390 --> 32:24.991
I've been going through
these logs he gave us.

32:25.026 --> 32:27.592
Most of his new accounts
are from residences

32:27.627 --> 32:29.298
where there
were recent 211s.

32:29.333 --> 32:30.246
It makes sense.

32:30.281 --> 32:32.145
Probably gets a list of
b and E's from a friendly cop.

32:32.180 --> 32:33.718
Or maybe he's staging
them himself

32:33.753 --> 32:35.560
to create a market
for his product.

32:35.595 --> 32:37.332
He's an ex-cop,
for Christ's sake.

32:37.367 --> 32:39.908
Then let's let him come in
and clear himself.

32:42.575 --> 32:43.484
You showed your hand,

32:43.519 --> 32:45.829
and a covert investigation
came up empty.

32:45.864 --> 32:48.246
I'm out of my department on
my ass because of this thing.

32:48.281 --> 32:50.289
Sounds like we both
had a bad day.

32:50.324 --> 32:53.252
I have a way to take
our respective shit piles

32:53.287 --> 32:56.335
and recycle them
into something useful.

32:56.370 --> 32:57.490
Pezuela's guard's up.

32:57.525 --> 32:59.766
It's gonna take more than you
turning your pockets inside out

32:59.801 --> 33:00.577
to get next to him.

33:00.612 --> 33:04.947
That's why I have to deliver
something that matters to him.

33:04.982 --> 33:08.249
I have to give him back
the blackmail box.

33:10.052 --> 33:12.615
We'd be handing the man
a loaded gun.

33:12.650 --> 33:13.581
Do the math.

33:13.616 --> 33:16.141
If someone like Pezuela can't lean
on people to do his bidding,

33:16.176 --> 33:18.175
it costs him
juice with the cartel.

33:18.210 --> 33:20.174
The harder it becomes for us
to use him

33:20.209 --> 33:21.600
to move up the food chain.

33:21.635 --> 33:22.749
Now, I'm in your wing tips,

33:22.784 --> 33:23.828
I'm going after the guy

33:23.863 --> 33:26.606
that's making Pezuela
lose sleep at night.

33:26.641 --> 33:28.622
And the box by itself is nothing

33:28.657 --> 33:30.451
but a tell-all
about human weakness.

33:30.486 --> 33:32.399
It doesn't even get you Pezuela.

33:32.434 --> 33:34.278
Let him put the box in play.

33:34.313 --> 33:37.672
That keeps him positioned
as the cartel's go-to guy.

33:37.707 --> 33:38.523
At the very least,

33:38.558 --> 33:40.701
we get him
on conspiracy and extortion.

33:40.736 --> 33:43.596
With me on the inside
keeping a travel log

33:43.631 --> 33:46.456
of all the dark and dirty places
he visits.

33:50.638 --> 33:52.773
Unless you have a better plan.

33:56.645 --> 33:58.463
Only one problem
with your idea.

33:58.498 --> 34:00.115
Pezuela's gonna smell a rat

34:00.150 --> 34:02.455
when he gets this back
and your file's not inside it.

34:02.490 --> 34:06.164
Especially since he knows the
agency's dogging his every move.

34:06.199 --> 34:08.011
That's why I've got to get it
back from Aceveda

34:08.045 --> 34:09.728
and put it back inside.

34:09.764 --> 34:12.074
You gonna be all right
with that?

34:12.110 --> 34:13.512
This sting works,

34:13.547 --> 34:16.806
maybe I'll finally be able
to hang up my kneepads.

34:16.842 --> 34:20.478
Keep them on just a little while
longer and this all goes away.

34:20.513 --> 34:22.831
Aceveda's not gonna
just hand it over.

34:22.866 --> 34:24.884
I already went to his office
today and asked.

34:24.918 --> 34:27.652
I've known David a long time.

34:27.688 --> 34:30.387
It's all about how you ask.

34:31.636 --> 34:33.895
I'm working undercover
for I.c.E.

34:33.929 --> 34:34.911
The box is back in play.

34:34.946 --> 34:37.561
We need Olivia's file
in order to sell it to Pezuela.

34:37.596 --> 34:38.983
When the hell
did this happen?

34:39.018 --> 34:40.433
You said something
this morning

34:40.467 --> 34:42.217
about wanting
to see justice done.

34:42.252 --> 34:44.496
Time to jump on board
the karma train.

34:44.532 --> 34:46.743
I have to handle Pezuela
very carefully.

34:46.777 --> 34:47.708
He can hurt me.

34:47.744 --> 34:49.433
And you, you say you want
to bring him down?

34:49.467 --> 34:50.945
You were just working
for the man.

34:50.980 --> 34:52.280
She had no choice.

34:52.315 --> 34:53.545
Iook, I'm sorry,

34:53.580 --> 34:55.907
but Vic doesn't make a very
compelling character witness.

34:55.942 --> 34:57.792
Holding on to your file
gives me a card to play

34:57.827 --> 34:59.858
in case you're ever tempted
to switch sides again.

34:59.893 --> 35:01.890
Here's what happens if you don't
give up the file.

35:01.925 --> 35:03.463
Pezuela
doesn't take the bait.

35:03.498 --> 35:04.966
I.c.E. Doesn't understand why,

35:05.001 --> 35:06.737
so they put his balls
through the ringer

35:06.772 --> 35:09.626
just on general principle,
and he gives up Olivia anyway.

35:09.661 --> 35:12.641
Then I roll on you
for blackmailing me.

35:12.676 --> 35:15.676
And I back her story.

35:33.440 --> 35:35.400
You two make quite a team.

35:35.435 --> 35:37.725
You know how much of my life I
spent in interrogation rooms?

35:37.760 --> 35:39.327
It's quieter in here.
You mind?

35:39.362 --> 35:41.175
No, I'm fine with it.

35:41.210 --> 35:42.138
What's up, guys?

35:42.173 --> 35:44.333
You mind if
I cut to the Chase?

35:44.368 --> 35:45.833
I'd love that.

35:45.868 --> 35:48.430
The more security systems you
sell, the more money you make,

35:48.465 --> 35:50.413
and what better way
to stimulate demand

35:50.448 --> 35:53.424
than breaking into houses.

35:57.355 --> 35:59.732
I spent 15 years on the job.

35:59.767 --> 36:03.310
This is a hell of a way to thank
me for my time and service.

36:03.345 --> 36:05.237
There's a quick
and easy way to clear this up.

36:05.272 --> 36:06.784
Perp got grazed by a bullet,

36:06.819 --> 36:08.741
left a trail of blood.

36:08.776 --> 36:10.777
What? You want
to check me out?

36:11.353 --> 36:13.041
Why didn't you say so?

36:20.992 --> 36:24.342
53. still ripped.

36:24.377 --> 36:26.581
You guys are too busy on the job

36:26.616 --> 36:28.785
to get to the gym regularly.

36:28.820 --> 36:31.526
I remember.

36:32.481 --> 36:36.849
Um, can you turn around so we
can see the back of your legs?

36:42.394 --> 36:44.688
Liking that ass?

36:45.395 --> 36:49.238
Can I go now or do you want
to tickle my balls?

36:49.273 --> 36:50.926
Uh, your partner,
j.r. Cornelius,

36:50.961 --> 36:51.700
I'd like to talk to him.

36:51.735 --> 36:53.092
How do I reach him?

36:53.127 --> 36:54.449
He's on vacation.

36:54.484 --> 36:55.552
Since when?

36:55.587 --> 36:56.586
Last weekend.

36:56.621 --> 36:59.172
J.r. Wasn't in town
when this happened,

36:59.207 --> 37:01.724
but you're welcome
to knock on his door.

37:02.878 --> 37:05.719
Woman's here to see someone
from the strike team.

37:05.754 --> 37:07.612
Somewhere we could talk?

37:07.647 --> 37:09.123
Bombay's as hard
as they get,

37:09.158 --> 37:10.599
but he
didn't kill no girl.

37:10.634 --> 37:11.916
Why do you say that?

37:11.951 --> 37:13.070
'Cause I saw who did.

37:13.105 --> 37:14.643
I'm working the track.

37:14.678 --> 37:16.181
Two-man rolls up on Amber,

37:16.216 --> 37:17.298
tells her to get in.

37:17.333 --> 37:19.379
Bitch wasn't trying to hear it
on account of knowing

37:19.414 --> 37:20.120
what's in store.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.012
Well, just 'cause
she got in his car

37:22.047 --> 37:23.869
doesn't mean
that he killed her.

37:23.904 --> 37:26.164
I'm gonna be real with you.

37:26.199 --> 37:30.492
Nigga gets a cut of what he
collects and any pussy he wants.

37:30.527 --> 37:31.953
Only he ain't about
hitting no trim.

37:31.988 --> 37:33.380
He about banging
those shorties.

37:33.415 --> 37:34.505
So he's into rough stuff.

37:34.540 --> 37:36.983
Shit. That brother don't even
get his swole on.

37:37.018 --> 37:38.987
Two-man
'bout bringing the pain.

37:39.022 --> 37:41.085
All the bitches he sent
to killah king with

37:41.120 --> 37:42.390
broken bones and shit.

37:42.425 --> 37:43.560
That's bad for business.

37:43.595 --> 37:44.661
Bombay put up with that?

37:44.696 --> 37:46.783
He never let him beat
on his earners, but, daddy,

37:46.818 --> 37:49.762
it was open season
on low-end skeezers.

37:49.797 --> 37:52.397
Amber should have taken her beat
down same as every other ho.

37:52.432 --> 37:54.464
The minute she said "no,"
it was on.

37:54.499 --> 37:57.595
Two-man snatched her by the
hair, bashed her in the face,

37:57.630 --> 37:59.317
banged her head against the car,

37:59.352 --> 38:01.676
and threw her in the back.

38:01.711 --> 38:02.399
When he drove off,

38:04.650 --> 38:07.096
you know, you'd have saved
everybody a lot of time

38:07.131 --> 38:09.543
and ammunition if you would have
told us this before.

38:09.578 --> 38:11.708
If I'd have snitched
on bombay's dude,

38:11.743 --> 38:15.264
I'd be in the mortuary
right behind Gray girl.

38:15.299 --> 38:18.002
Pimp juice dead.
It's all good.

38:18.037 --> 38:22.216
Be even safer if you tossed
two-man in and lose the key.

38:23.543 --> 38:25.462
You seem
like a good person,

38:26.222 --> 38:28.496
and you're just trying
to do the right thing.

38:28.885 --> 38:31.652
Maybe you saw two-man do those
things, maybe you didn't.

38:31.687 --> 38:32.420
I know what I seen.

38:32.455 --> 38:34.825
The point is, you're in a cloud of
chronic all day every day.

38:34.860 --> 38:36.646
You're not a credible witness.

38:36.681 --> 38:39.837
And I also have concerns
about your personal safety.

38:39.872 --> 38:42.994
What if you testify
and we don't get a conviction?

38:43.029 --> 38:45.245
I don't want anything
happening to you.

38:46.281 --> 38:49.362
I'm gonna treat this
as an anonymous tip.

38:49.397 --> 38:53.675
I ain't mad,
keeping it in the cut.

38:54.305 --> 38:57.437
Iooks like j.r. Decided
to vacation in the E.r.

38:57.472 --> 38:59.109
Out in riverside.

38:59.144 --> 39:00.712
That's news to me.

39:00.747 --> 39:02.458
He was being treated
for a gunshot wound.

39:02.493 --> 39:04.134
Arrived two hours
after the shooting.

39:04.169 --> 39:07.423
Told the doctors he was
an ex-cop who was wounded

39:07.458 --> 39:09.271
when his gun
accidently discharged.

39:09.306 --> 39:11.107
He always was clumsy.

39:11.142 --> 39:12.597
Riverside p.d.
Picked him up.

39:12.632 --> 39:14.435
They're bringing him
back here now.

39:14.470 --> 39:15.227
You know what it'll mean for us

39:15.262 --> 39:17.310
to be able to clear
all these open b and E's.

39:17.345 --> 39:19.359
Go easier for you
if you tell us what happened.

39:20.686 --> 39:22.840
We found blood
at the crime scene.

39:22.875 --> 39:25.868
When we test it,
it's gonna match j.r.'s.

39:31.267 --> 39:32.919
He's my partner.

39:33.566 --> 39:35.747
Well, I respect
that kind of loyalty,

39:35.782 --> 39:38.173
and since he's got more to lose
than you do,

39:38.208 --> 39:40.241
I hope he does, too.

39:40.873 --> 39:43.257
I walk on the b and E's.

39:43.292 --> 39:45.607
Trespassing and vandalism.

39:45.642 --> 39:48.954
Got to make sure you're out of
the home-protection business.

39:51.124 --> 39:52.572
We thought
the house was empty.

39:52.607 --> 39:55.182
I was on the lookout
when he went in.

39:55.217 --> 39:56.738
I heard the gunshot,

39:56.773 --> 39:58.476
and then he came running out.

39:59.355 --> 40:01.362
Then I drove him to his car.

40:02.610 --> 40:04.281
Shit.

40:04.514 --> 40:07.900
Bombay never posted lookouts
during a cook-up.

40:07.935 --> 40:09.888
He needed everybody in the lab.

40:09.923 --> 40:12.531
So why did he come out
guns blazing?

40:12.566 --> 40:15.140
- The phone call.
- What phone call?

40:15.175 --> 40:16.784
Somebody called his cell,

40:16.819 --> 40:19.820
said there were cops outside
are gonna kill him.

40:19.855 --> 40:21.166
He told us to get down,

40:21.201 --> 40:23.081
went for his gun,

40:23.116 --> 40:24.962
started shooting.

40:42.111 --> 40:43.545
You spun that sob story

40:43.557 --> 40:45.771
about killing your
girlfriend?

40:45.806 --> 40:48.996
Your pimp you set up bombay
for a death-by-cop payback

40:49.031 --> 40:50.216
for kicking you out?

40:50.251 --> 40:51.782
He's the one who started her
on the pipe.

40:51.817 --> 40:53.140
He got what he deserved.

40:57.251 --> 41:00.117
I don't give a shit
about your goddamn pimp!

41:00.649 --> 41:01.717
You understand?!

41:01.752 --> 41:02.750
You called him.

41:02.785 --> 41:05.221
You warned him
so he'd come out blasting!

41:05.256 --> 41:08.347
You used me! You used
one of my guys as a shooter!

41:08.382 --> 41:11.438
You could have gotten us
all killed, you sick bitch!

41:11.473 --> 41:12.310
Oh, I used you.

41:12.345 --> 41:13.968
Played you same as last time.

41:14.003 --> 41:15.175
I remember it all now.

41:15.210 --> 41:17.933
You were an asshole
back then, too.

41:22.311 --> 41:25.120
You just keep getting
more pathetic and miserable.

41:25.155 --> 41:27.648
I still got you handling
my business for me.

41:27.683 --> 41:29.450
May not be so pretty any more,

41:29.485 --> 41:31.183
but I am walking, talking pussy,

41:31.218 --> 41:33.438
and you let me lead you around
by your dick.

41:36.498 --> 41:38.493
You ever thought
about just cutting it off?

41:38.528 --> 41:40.648
Free your mind
once and for all?

41:40.982 --> 41:42.987
Ha ha. Ha ha.

41:56.023 --> 41:59.011
When I went over to your house
this morning to check on you,

41:59.271 --> 42:02.870
I had to break a window
and go into your house.

42:05.646 --> 42:08.352
- Had to?
- I was worried.

42:08.522 --> 42:11.565
Oh, you thought I was lying dead
on the floor because I'm sick?

42:12.065 --> 42:14.072
You live alone,

42:14.242 --> 42:16.726
your car was in the driveway,
nobody came to the door,

42:16.896 --> 42:18.697
there was a b and E down the block

42:18.957 --> 42:22.014
and a potentially
dangerous suspect on the loose

42:22.403 --> 42:24.885
I'm gonna send you the Bill
for that window.

42:31.100 --> 42:33.604
I know I've been a little lax.

42:34.770 --> 42:36.966
It was obvious
you're not taking care of yourself.

42:37.226 --> 42:39.212
James isn't in your life anymore.

42:39.382 --> 42:42.160
- We need to get you a little help.
- I don't need help.

42:42.916 --> 42:46.641
Iook, the house is messy.
I'll clean it up.

42:52.727 --> 42:54.441
Iook, you have to...

42:54.701 --> 42:57.278
you have to understand it takes...

42:58.724 --> 43:02.523
every ounce of energy for me to be here

43:03.169 --> 43:06.687
every day
to do what I need to get done.

43:07.548 --> 43:10.639
By the time I get home,
I don't have nothing left.

43:15.668 --> 43:19.049
I-I, uh, hired you a cleaning lady.

43:19.309 --> 43:21.412
Her name is Cecilia.

43:21.582 --> 43:23.891
She'll be coming
on mondays and thursdays.

43:24.061 --> 43:26.481
- Dutch.
- I will pay for it.

43:27.359 --> 43:31.103
- I'll pay for it.
- No, I will.

43:31.363 --> 43:33.330
So I know she's doing the job.

43:36.326 --> 43:39.199
Is she even legal?

43:41.120 --> 43:44.146
Uh, she's coming on mondays
and thursdays.

43:44.316 --> 43:47.828
I just need a key
so she can get in the house.

43:56.420 --> 43:57.801
Vic, please, don't.

43:57.971 --> 44:00.466
I thought I'd give another shot
to try to talk this out.

44:00.726 --> 44:03.653
I'm sure we'd both rather see that money
we're about to burn through

44:03.823 --> 44:06.597
go into Lee's college, right?

44:10.092 --> 44:11.365
Okay.

44:13.501 --> 44:14.563
I give.

44:15.133 --> 44:17.291
But I'm gonna need parameters
that I can live with.

44:17.461 --> 44:20.569
I'll put your name on the birth
certificate, but I want sole custody,

44:20.829 --> 44:23.030
and we got to work out
visitation rights.

44:23.290 --> 44:24.724
I can live with that.

44:25.850 --> 44:27.629
I talked to this family arbitrator.

44:27.799 --> 44:30.537
She said that we can, you know,
sit down and work out the details.

44:30.797 --> 44:32.873
I'm there.
Just tell me when and where.

44:34.463 --> 44:36.585
I'll call tomorrow, get some times.

44:36.845 --> 44:40.297
Hey, I'm glad we're gonna be able
to reason our way through this.

44:40.557 --> 44:42.800
In the end,
it's really gonna work out for the best.

44:44.870 --> 44:46.637
That's what I want for Lee.

44:46.897 --> 44:48.305
All right.

44:48.475 --> 44:50.474
I'll see you in the morning.

44:50.734 --> 44:52.381
See you in the morning.

45:26.270 --> 45:28.553
You need to get a better lock,
two-man.

45:28.723 --> 45:30.389
Some lowlife could break in.

45:30.649 --> 45:34.318
- You got a warrant?
- Shit, no.

45:35.488 --> 45:37.150
What you want then?

45:37.320 --> 45:40.190
Chop it up with you
about that strawberry you beat to death.

45:40.450 --> 45:42.740
I don't know nothing
about no dead strawberry.

45:42.910 --> 45:44.245
Cut the shit.

45:44.415 --> 45:46.620
Bombay... now deceased, FYI...

45:46.790 --> 45:50.330
Ioaned you his gash crew
as a part of your compensation package.

45:50.500 --> 45:52.090
Don't mean I killed the bitch.

45:52.260 --> 45:53.954
You went too tough on Amber.

45:54.214 --> 45:56.707
I got an eyewitness
who saw the whole thing go down.

45:57.604 --> 46:00.279
Now, there are two different ways
we can handle this.

46:00.449 --> 46:03.088
I can take you in,
my eyewitness fingers you,

46:03.348 --> 46:05.799
I arrest you for murder
with special circumstances,

46:06.059 --> 46:07.593
but you know what that gets you?

46:10.949 --> 46:12.948
Or you can work with me

46:13.897 --> 46:16.268
and make this whole thing go away.

46:16.895 --> 46:18.687
Work with you how?

46:18.857 --> 46:20.898
I need your help
getting rid of somebody,

46:21.158 --> 46:23.525
and that's gonna mean
looking somebody in the eye

46:23.785 --> 46:25.419
and pulling the trigger, though.

46:25.589 --> 46:27.708
You ain't serious.

46:27.878 --> 46:30.773
You don't know
how goddamn serious I am.

46:34.384 --> 46:37.664
Ain't no thing. Who?

46:38.496 --> 46:41.168
How's your jaw feeling?
