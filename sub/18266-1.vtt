03:26.273 --> 03:27.691
Hey, Mr. McAllister.

03:27.795 --> 03:30.214
Not wasting any time,
are you, Tracy?

03:30.405 --> 03:34.076
You know what they say
about the early bird.

03:34.275 --> 03:35.693
Yeah, I do.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.301
Good luck there, Tracy.

03:39.452 --> 03:41.662
Thanks, Mr. M.
I'll see you in class.

03:44.802 --> 03:46.387
None of this
would've happened

03:46.542 --> 03:49.170
if Mr. McAllister hadn't
meddled the way he did.

03:49.325 --> 03:51.661
He should've just accepted
things as they are,

03:51.805 --> 03:54.140
instead of trying
to interfere with destiny.

03:54.328 --> 03:57.164
You see, you can't
interfere with destiny.

03:57.329 --> 03:58.705
That's why it's destiny.

03:58.808 --> 04:00.685
And if you try to interfere,

04:00.808 --> 04:03.186
the same thing's
just gonna happen anyway,

04:03.330 --> 04:04.707
and you'll just suffer.

04:07.333 --> 04:09.668
It's hard to remember
how the whole thing started,

04:09.811 --> 04:11.229
the whole election mess.

04:11.334 --> 04:14.545
What I do remember
is that I loved my job.

04:14.726 --> 04:16.185
I was a teacher,

04:16.336 --> 04:17.296
an educator,

04:17.423 --> 04:20.091
and I couldn't imagine
doing anything else.

04:20.295 --> 04:21.921
Mr. McAllister.

04:22.034 --> 04:23.619
Mr. M!

04:23.774 --> 04:25.985
Quit day dreaming.
Get back to work.

04:26.210 --> 04:29.630
The students knew
it wasn't just a job for me.

04:29.863 --> 04:31.114
I got involved.

04:31.255 --> 04:33.090
Put down the cards, boys!

04:33.256 --> 04:34.632
This game is over!

04:34.778 --> 04:36.071
And I cared.

04:36.213 --> 04:38.132
Come on, Wolverines!

04:38.257 --> 04:39.175
Defense! Let's go!

04:39.258 --> 04:41.134
And I think
I made a difference.

04:41.303 --> 04:43.138
I knew I touched
the students' lives

04:43.303 --> 04:45.597
during their difficult
young adult years.

04:45.783 --> 04:49.578
And I took that
responsibility seriously.

04:49.827 --> 04:53.080
In the 12 years
I taught U.S. history,

04:53.306 --> 04:55.600
civics, and current events
at Carver,

04:55.786 --> 04:58.580
I was voted
Teacher of the Year 3 times.

04:58.787 --> 05:00.497
A school record.

05:00.657 --> 05:03.577
Teaching was all
I'd ever wanted to do.

05:05.746 --> 05:09.083
Standing in front of
a roomful of young people,

05:09.313 --> 05:11.649
trying to get them excited
about the world,

05:11.835 --> 05:13.670
trying to make them think,

05:13.837 --> 05:17.090
preparing them for the tough
moral and ethical decisions

05:17.315 --> 05:19.151
that they'd face as adults,

05:19.317 --> 05:21.069
that's how I wanted
to spend my life.

05:22.230 --> 05:24.107
So is this
a moral situation

05:24.232 --> 05:26.317
or an ethical situation?

05:26.493 --> 05:29.287
What's the difference between
morals and ethics anyway?

05:29.495 --> 05:30.621
Anybody?

05:32.235 --> 05:33.653
Derek.

05:33.757 --> 05:35.634
Yeah. Ethics is
like when you do

05:35.758 --> 05:37.885
what society tells you
is right to do.

05:38.063 --> 05:39.148
And morals...

05:41.761 --> 05:43.637
Yeah, yeah,
you're on the right track.

05:43.761 --> 05:44.887
Can anybody help him out?

05:47.632 --> 05:48.591
Michelle.

05:48.719 --> 05:51.096
Morals are like...
lessons.

05:51.287 --> 05:53.289
You know, like
the moral of a story.

05:53.461 --> 05:57.048
It's what you learn
from a story or a fable.

05:57.288 --> 05:59.624
Or a life experience. Good.

05:59.768 --> 06:00.977
And ethics?

06:01.117 --> 06:04.579
Um, ethics is how
you use the morals

06:04.812 --> 06:06.772
that you learn
from the story?

06:06.901 --> 06:10.196
Yeah, OK, but I think we're
missing something key here.

06:10.423 --> 06:12.133
What are we missing?

06:20.211 --> 06:21.045
Tracy.

06:21.124 --> 06:23.292
Ethics are rules of conduct...

06:24.429 --> 06:25.806
Tracy Flick.

06:25.951 --> 06:26.827
Tracy Flick.

06:26.952 --> 06:28.620
I'd seen a lot of
ambitious students

06:28.778 --> 06:30.155
come and go over the years,

06:30.257 --> 06:33.552
but Tracy Flick,
she was a special case.

06:34.911 --> 06:36.621
Some people say
I'm an overachiever,

06:36.782 --> 06:38.158
but I think
they're just jealous.

06:38.304 --> 06:40.140
My mom always tells me
I'm different.

06:40.305 --> 06:41.640
You know, special.

06:41.784 --> 06:43.160
And if you look
at all the things

06:43.306 --> 06:44.182
I've accomplished so far,

06:44.306 --> 06:46.600
I think you'd have to agree.

06:53.311 --> 06:55.646
Here I am as Hodel in
FiddlerOn The Roof.

06:55.789 --> 06:58.625
Matchmaker, matchmaker,
I'll bring the veil

06:58.790 --> 07:00.333
You bring the groom

07:00.487 --> 07:04.074
And here I am on KCHS,
our student-run TV station.

07:04.314 --> 07:06.149
The littering must stop.

07:06.315 --> 07:07.941
Tracy Flick reporting.

07:08.099 --> 07:10.142
But it was in the S.G.A.,

07:10.317 --> 07:11.693
the Student Government
Association,

07:11.840 --> 07:13.174
where I made my biggest mark.

07:13.319 --> 07:15.154
I never missed a single meeting.

07:15.319 --> 07:17.154
And I volunteered
for every committee,

07:17.320 --> 07:19.155
as long as I could lead it.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.363
I agree with Ashley!

07:20.495 --> 07:22.121
I think we should rent
the barrels ahead of time

07:22.235 --> 07:24.153
because what happened
last time was a travesty.

07:24.322 --> 07:25.406
It was ridiculous,

07:25.540 --> 07:27.125
and I think it really
reflected poorly on all ofus.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.574
Now Tracy Flick
was poised to win

07:29.758 --> 07:32.136
the presidency
ofthe student body.

07:32.325 --> 07:35.078
And so far,
she was running unopposed.

07:35.283 --> 07:38.078
Determined by a culture
at a certain time in history.

07:39.371 --> 07:41.164
Oh, there's
one more thing about Tracy

07:41.329 --> 07:42.872
I think you should know.

07:43.025 --> 07:46.946
Her pussy gets so wet
you can't believe it.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.036
Don't tell me that.

07:49.201 --> 07:50.661
Don't tell me that.
I don't want to know that.

07:50.767 --> 07:52.643
A few months
before the election,

07:52.768 --> 07:54.645
she'd gotten herself
in a little trouble

07:54.812 --> 07:58.107
with my best friend
Dave Novotny.

07:58.336 --> 08:00.129
Foxy

08:00.293 --> 08:02.628
Dave came to Carver
the year after I did,

08:02.816 --> 08:04.651
and we hit it off right away.

08:04.816 --> 08:06.652
Dave was one of those guys
who taught

08:06.817 --> 08:08.152
because they never wanted
to leave high school

08:08.296 --> 08:09.672
in the first place.

08:09.818 --> 08:12.612
But basically, he was a good guy.

08:12.819 --> 08:15.113
Our wives became best friends, too.

08:15.298 --> 08:17.634
And when Dave and Linda's
son Darryl was born,

08:17.821 --> 08:20.115
they asked us to be
his godparents.

08:21.952 --> 08:24.288
You probably think the worst,

08:24.432 --> 08:27.101
that Mr. Novotny was
taking horrible advantage

08:27.260 --> 08:28.636
of one of his students.

08:28.739 --> 08:31.116
But it wasn't like that at all.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.597
Our relationship was
based on mutual respect

08:33.740 --> 08:34.783
and admiration.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.583
I mean, during my
sophomore year in geometry,

08:37.741 --> 08:39.618
it was strictly
professional between us.

08:39.741 --> 08:41.577
I mean, nothing.

08:41.743 --> 08:43.160
It wasn't until junior year

08:43.267 --> 08:45.143
when we worked together
on the year book

08:45.267 --> 08:47.144
that things got kind of serious.

08:47.268 --> 08:49.145
One night he took
us editors out to celebrate

08:49.268 --> 08:50.686
after a deadline.

08:50.790 --> 08:53.126
Eventually, Dave and I
were left alone,

08:53.270 --> 08:54.688
and we got to talking.

08:54.792 --> 08:56.669
Not like teacher and student,

08:56.793 --> 08:58.169
but like 2 adults.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.689
You know, Tracy,

08:59.794 --> 09:01.671
I notice that
you don't seem to have

09:01.795 --> 09:03.672
any close friends at Carver.

09:03.796 --> 09:05.673
You seem to be kind of a loner.

09:05.797 --> 09:08.466
No, I'm not.
I'm just real busy.

09:08.624 --> 09:11.126
Oh, no. I know, I know
it's not by choice.

09:11.277 --> 09:13.654
I just mean that, that, well...

09:13.799 --> 09:16.176
being the kind of person you are,

09:16.278 --> 09:18.197
it must be really difficult foryou

09:18.323 --> 09:20.033
to find somebody
you could talk to.

09:20.150 --> 09:21.693
What do you mean?

09:21.803 --> 09:24.139
What kind of person am I?

09:26.326 --> 09:30.121
Tracy, you know, I've been
watching you for going on...

09:30.328 --> 09:31.704
3 years now,

09:31.806 --> 09:34.809
and I think you are
one of the most talented,

09:35.026 --> 09:38.070
hard-working,
sensitive, attractive,

09:38.287 --> 09:40.164
brilliant students I...

09:40.331 --> 09:41.249
No.

09:42.680 --> 09:44.932
Human beings I have ever met.

09:46.334 --> 09:47.293
Thank you.

09:47.421 --> 09:50.174
And I know that
sometimes people like you

09:50.336 --> 09:54.131
have to pay a price
for their greatness.

09:54.337 --> 09:56.881
And that price is loneliness.

09:56.990 --> 10:00.327
I don't know.
maybe I'm wrong, but...

10:00.514 --> 10:05.060
it just seems to me like
you might need a friend.

10:08.865 --> 10:10.575
Since I grew up
without a dad,

10:10.690 --> 10:12.108
you might assume, psychologically,

10:12.213 --> 10:14.215
I was looking
for a father figure.

10:14.345 --> 10:16.722
But that had nothing
to do with it at all.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.744
It was just that
Dave was so strong,

10:18.868 --> 10:21.745
and he made me feel
so safe and protected.

10:21.913 --> 10:25.584
It was the first time
somebody ever saw the real me,

10:25.828 --> 10:27.663
the me that nobody else knows.

10:27.829 --> 10:30.748
OK, here. Get down. Get down.

10:40.311 --> 10:42.146
You're once

10:42.312 --> 10:43.188
Twice

10:45.313 --> 10:49.568
Three times a lady

10:51.316 --> 10:56.988
And I love you

10:58.841 --> 11:01.135
Yes, you're once

11:01.319 --> 11:02.695
Twice

11:04.842 --> 11:06.678
Three times a lady

11:10.324 --> 11:17.873
And I love you

11:20.284 --> 11:23.537
I love

11:23.763 --> 11:25.140
You

11:26.373 --> 11:28.166
When I think back
on my relationship

11:28.286 --> 11:29.663
with Mr. Novotny,

11:29.765 --> 11:32.601
what I miss most is our talks.

11:34.767 --> 11:37.144
You did it in your house?

11:37.291 --> 11:38.709
In your own house?

11:38.813 --> 11:41.774
OK, I know it seems crazy, but...

11:41.945 --> 11:45.114
Jim, what I'm trying
to tell you is that...

11:45.293 --> 11:46.711
Tracy and I...

11:46.815 --> 11:49.151
are totally, totally...

11:49.294 --> 11:51.255
in love.

11:52.556 --> 11:54.600
- In love?
- Yeah.

11:54.775 --> 11:55.817
It's serious.

11:55.950 --> 11:58.786
She inspires me in ways
that Linda never has.

11:58.951 --> 12:00.953
She even wants to read my novel.

12:01.125 --> 12:03.127
But you haven't
written your novel.

12:03.300 --> 12:04.677
That's the whole point!

12:04.779 --> 12:07.157
I... I've got the whole thing
right here!

12:07.302 --> 12:09.178
I just need
to get it out there.

12:09.302 --> 12:12.597
And Tracy wants me to write it
so she can read it.

12:12.782 --> 12:13.699
It's beautiful.

12:13.782 --> 12:15.200
Dave...

12:15.305 --> 12:18.600
I'm just saying this
as your friend.

12:18.785 --> 12:22.246
What you're doing is
really, really wrong,

12:22.438 --> 12:24.357
and you've gotta stop.

12:24.482 --> 12:26.443
The line you've crossed is...

12:26.613 --> 12:28.448
It's immoral,
and it's illegal.

12:28.614 --> 12:29.948
Jim, come on.

12:30.093 --> 12:32.178
I don't need a lecture on ethics.

12:32.311 --> 12:33.479
I'm not talking about ethics.

12:33.617 --> 12:35.077
I'm talking about morals.

12:36.791 --> 12:38.835
What's the difference?

12:38.966 --> 12:40.635
I guess
I don't have to tell you

12:40.793 --> 12:42.628
how this all turned out.

12:59.323 --> 13:01.158
Tracy's mom...

13:01.323 --> 13:03.325
she doesn't understand.

13:03.454 --> 13:05.164
No. I'd say she doesn't.

13:05.325 --> 13:09.537
Fact is, I have never seen
a mother so upset.

13:10.936 --> 13:13.856
All right. I know what
Tracy told her mother,

13:14.067 --> 13:15.652
what her mother told me.

13:15.806 --> 13:17.641
I need to hear this from you

13:17.807 --> 13:19.642
because I have
a legal responsibility here.

13:19.807 --> 13:21.601
Let me ask you this.

13:24.245 --> 13:26.956
Did you cross the line
with this girl?

13:34.770 --> 13:35.646
I di...

13:37.249 --> 13:38.125
W-We...

13:40.250 --> 13:42.086
We're in love.

13:46.776 --> 13:47.943
Your novel?!

13:48.080 --> 13:49.623
Are you fucking kidding me?

13:49.777 --> 13:50.652
Linda...

13:50.777 --> 13:52.153
After Dave got fired,

13:52.256 --> 13:53.632
Linda kicked him out of the house

13:53.778 --> 13:55.154
and filed for divorce.

13:55.300 --> 13:58.095
He ended up
moving back to Milwaukee

13:58.301 --> 13:59.177
to live with his parents.

13:59.302 --> 14:00.469
He's lucky he's not in jail.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.025
Linda!

14:04.304 --> 14:06.348
And ethics are the basis of...

14:07.610 --> 14:09.487
OK. We'll pick up here next time.

14:15.091 --> 14:16.175
Would it be possible for me

14:16.309 --> 14:18.519
to retake the test
we took yesterday?

14:18.701 --> 14:20.035
The test yesterday?
You wanna retake it?

14:20.180 --> 14:22.098
Yeah. I had to work
the night before,

14:22.267 --> 14:23.184
and I didn't have
enough time to study.

14:23.268 --> 14:24.186
Oh, yeah?

14:25.573 --> 14:27.450
Now that I have
more life experience,

14:27.574 --> 14:29.743
I feel sorry
for Mr. McAllister.

14:29.922 --> 14:32.717
I mean, anyone who's stuck
in the same little room,

14:32.923 --> 14:34.633
wearing the same stupid clothes,

14:34.751 --> 14:37.587
same exact same things
year after year

14:37.752 --> 14:39.128
for his whole life,

14:39.231 --> 14:41.608
while his students
go on to good colleges

14:41.753 --> 14:44.589
and move to big cities
and do great things

14:44.754 --> 14:47.548
and make loads of money,

14:47.755 --> 14:49.632
he's gotta be at least
a little jealous.

14:49.755 --> 14:51.173
I noticed it was
a little low for you.

14:51.279 --> 14:52.614
It's like my mom says:

14:52.758 --> 14:56.095
The weak are always trying
to sabotage the strong.

14:56.281 --> 14:58.616
One thing that's important
to know about me

14:58.760 --> 15:00.178
is that I'm an only child,

15:00.282 --> 15:02.617
so my mom
is really devoted to me.

15:02.761 --> 15:04.179
And I love her so much.

15:04.284 --> 15:06.161
She wants me
to do all the things

15:06.285 --> 15:08.620
that she wanted to do
in life but couldn't.

15:08.763 --> 15:10.640
Mom used to be a stewardess
for Northwest,

15:10.764 --> 15:13.142
and now she works as a paralegal.

15:13.288 --> 15:15.164
She likes to write letters
to successful women

15:15.288 --> 15:17.165
like Elizabeth Dole
and Connie Chung

15:17.289 --> 15:19.166
and ask them how they got
to be where they are

15:19.289 --> 15:21.083
and what advice
do they have for me,

15:21.247 --> 15:23.208
Tracy, her daughter.

15:23.378 --> 15:24.629
9 times out of 10,

15:24.770 --> 15:26.605
they say you have
to hold onto your dreams

15:26.770 --> 15:27.646
no matter what.

15:27.770 --> 15:28.646
The pressures women face

15:28.771 --> 15:30.606
mean you have to work
twice as hard,

15:30.771 --> 15:34.025
and you can't let anything
or anyone stand in your way.

15:34.251 --> 15:35.627
Hey! Hey!

15:35.775 --> 15:37.819
One per person!
Put those back!

15:37.993 --> 15:39.369
Eat me.

15:39.472 --> 15:42.100
But you know,
winning isn't everything.

15:42.255 --> 15:46.051
Win or lose, ethical conduct
is the most important thing.

15:46.300 --> 15:47.843
Just ask Mr. McAllister.

15:47.996 --> 15:49.164
Mr. McAllister!

15:49.301 --> 15:51.970
Mr. McAllister, wait up!

15:52.172 --> 15:53.632
Mr. McAllister, don't go!

15:56.783 --> 15:58.618
I got all my signatures.

15:58.784 --> 16:01.119
There's 158, way more than I need.

16:01.306 --> 16:02.640
Hey, that's super.

16:02.785 --> 16:04.161
Here they are.

16:04.307 --> 16:05.641
Oh, you can just
put them in my box,

16:05.786 --> 16:07.496
and I'll take a look
at them tomorrow.

16:07.657 --> 16:09.159
Could you approve them now

16:09.309 --> 16:11.144
because I'd really like
to kick off my campaign

16:11.310 --> 16:13.145
right away, you know,
in the morning.

16:13.310 --> 16:14.186
Right.

16:20.226 --> 16:23.062
Yeah, yeah.
Those look good to me.

16:23.228 --> 16:25.105
Aren't you supposed to keep them?

16:25.228 --> 16:26.646
No. That's fiine.

16:26.751 --> 16:28.670
I thought you were
supposed to keep them.

16:31.231 --> 16:33.108
Yeah, right, fiine, OK.

16:33.232 --> 16:34.650
Thanks for everything.

16:34.753 --> 16:35.671
You bet.

16:39.278 --> 16:41.614
I can't wait
to start campaigning.

16:41.756 --> 16:42.674
What's that?

16:42.757 --> 16:44.175
I can't wait
to start campaigning.

16:44.280 --> 16:46.156
Oh. Well, it should
be easy for you.

16:46.280 --> 16:47.656
So far, no competition.

16:47.759 --> 16:49.636
Yeah, but you know,
Coca-Cola's by far

16:49.760 --> 16:50.677
the world's number one soft drink,

16:50.760 --> 16:52.637
and they spend
more money than anybody

16:52.761 --> 16:53.803
on advertising.

16:53.892 --> 16:57.104
I guess that's how come
they stay number one.

16:57.283 --> 16:58.660
Yeah.

16:58.762 --> 17:01.140
OK. Well, good luck there, Tracy.

17:01.286 --> 17:04.330
You know, Mr. M...

17:04.548 --> 17:06.675
when I win the presidency,
that means you and I

17:06.767 --> 17:08.977
are gonna be spending
a lot of time together,

17:09.115 --> 17:12.076
and I for one would really
like that time to be...

17:12.290 --> 17:15.334
harmonious and productive.

17:15.551 --> 17:17.178
Wouldn't you?

17:18.336 --> 17:19.212
Sure.

17:21.816 --> 17:22.817
OK.

17:22.945 --> 17:24.656
That's what I thought.
I was just checking.

17:24.773 --> 17:27.026
Yeah. Good luck there, Tracy.

17:27.209 --> 17:28.960
OK.

17:33.777 --> 17:36.571
I don't blame Tracy
for what happened with Dave.

17:36.778 --> 17:38.070
How could I?

17:38.170 --> 17:40.381
Dave was an adult,
more than twice her age.

17:40.562 --> 17:43.565
Sure, she got on my nerves
once in a while,

17:43.781 --> 17:46.575
but I admired Tracy.
I really did.

17:48.304 --> 17:52.308
Thank God for Diane.
She was my best friend.

17:52.523 --> 17:54.608
My source of love and strength.

17:54.785 --> 17:56.620
Oh, sure, we'd had
our share of bumpy times,

17:56.785 --> 17:59.246
but we'd always seen them through.

17:59.439 --> 18:03.067
After 9 years of marriage,
we were closer than ever.

18:04.832 --> 18:05.792
Anything wrong?

18:07.312 --> 18:08.688
No. No.

18:08.834 --> 18:10.752
Just, you know, school.

18:16.314 --> 18:18.567
When I win the presidency,

18:18.751 --> 18:22.004
we're gonna be spending
a lot of time together.

18:22.230 --> 18:26.025
Lots and lots and lots oftime.

18:26.232 --> 18:29.068
President and advisor.

18:29.277 --> 18:32.530
Harmonious and productive.

18:32.756 --> 18:35.551
Close and special.

18:35.757 --> 18:37.884
You... and I.

19:09.770 --> 19:11.146
Hey, P.J.

19:11.249 --> 19:13.126
What are you doing here
in the boys' locker room?

19:13.251 --> 19:14.710
I've come to see
the star quarterback

19:14.859 --> 19:16.110
before the big game.

19:16.252 --> 19:18.629
But what if Coach Henderson walks in?

19:18.774 --> 19:21.276
Oh, that's OK.
I took care of him.

19:21.471 --> 19:23.139
So, uh, what you reading?

19:23.254 --> 19:26.048
I'm just reviewing my playbook.

19:26.255 --> 19:28.591
I have a playwe can practice.

19:28.778 --> 19:30.196
You be quarterback.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.427
I'll be tight end.

19:43.305 --> 19:46.141
You know,
Coca-Cola is by far

19:46.306 --> 19:49.142
the world's number one soft drink.

19:57.833 --> 19:59.167
Paul.

19:59.268 --> 20:00.186
Aah!

20:06.835 --> 20:08.837
Aah! Aaahhh!

20:08.967 --> 20:10.677
Aah!

20:10.839 --> 20:12.715
I was so mad at God
when I broke my leg

20:12.839 --> 20:14.925
at Shadow Ridge over Christmas break.

20:15.100 --> 20:17.603
Why?!

20:17.797 --> 20:19.674
The doctors told me
I'd have to quit sports

20:19.841 --> 20:22.344
for at least a couple
ofyears, if not forever,

20:22.538 --> 20:24.165
which meant
no first-string quarterback

20:24.321 --> 20:25.656
in the fall.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.635
It was like the end of my life.

20:27.801 --> 20:30.595
When I got back to school,
everybody was so supportive,

20:30.802 --> 20:33.596
and they all wanted to sign
my cast and everything,

20:33.803 --> 20:35.930
but I still couldn't
shake the feeling

20:36.109 --> 20:38.153
that now my life had no purpose.

20:38.327 --> 20:40.162
What did God want from me?

20:40.328 --> 20:42.622
Why did I exist?

20:42.807 --> 20:45.602
Sometimes you can search
everywhere for answers.

20:45.808 --> 20:48.144
Then one day,
destiny just walks up

20:48.330 --> 20:50.165
and taps you on the shoulder.

20:50.331 --> 20:53.125
I know because it happened to me.

20:55.159 --> 20:57.829
Paul, can I speak
to you for a minute?

20:57.986 --> 21:00.364
Mr. McAllister
changed my life.

21:00.510 --> 21:03.638
And no matter what they say
he did or did not do,

21:03.858 --> 21:06.152
I believe he is a good man.

21:06.337 --> 21:09.632
Paul, I know you've
been pretty down

21:09.861 --> 21:11.404
since your accident.

21:11.514 --> 21:14.850
Yeah. I wanted to play
football again so bad

21:15.036 --> 21:16.121
I could taste it,

21:16.211 --> 21:18.213
and maybe go on
to the playoffs and...

21:18.343 --> 21:19.261
I know.

21:19.343 --> 21:20.553
I understand disappointment.

21:20.691 --> 21:21.609
I really do.

21:21.692 --> 21:22.609
Yeah.

21:22.692 --> 21:23.735
Now, I personally think

21:23.866 --> 21:25.701
you have a very bright
future ahead of you.

21:25.867 --> 21:27.159
And I'm not talking about

21:27.302 --> 21:29.262
the fleeting glory of sports.

21:29.390 --> 21:30.766
What do you mean?

21:30.869 --> 21:32.329
Let me give you a clue.

21:32.478 --> 21:34.147
You're a natural-born leader.

21:34.305 --> 21:37.099
You're one ofthe most
popular students at Carver.

21:37.306 --> 21:38.640
You're honest,
you're straight forward,

21:38.785 --> 21:40.370
and you don't crack under pressure,

21:40.524 --> 21:42.401
as we all saw in
an amazing fourth quarter

21:42.570 --> 21:44.113
against West side.

21:44.221 --> 21:46.140
All the kids look up to you.

21:46.309 --> 21:48.020
Now, what does that spell?

21:53.834 --> 21:55.169
Student...

21:55.313 --> 21:56.689
council...

21:56.835 --> 21:58.420
president.

21:58.575 --> 22:00.160
Who, me?

22:00.316 --> 22:01.900
Oh, no. I...

22:02.056 --> 22:05.351
I don't know anything
about that stuff, Mr. M.

22:05.578 --> 22:07.664
I mean, besides,
that's Tracy Flick's thing.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.175
She's always working so hard.

22:09.319 --> 22:11.279
Yeah. She's a real
go-getter, all right.

22:11.406 --> 22:13.241
And she's super nice.

22:13.363 --> 22:14.698
Yeah, yeah,

22:14.842 --> 22:16.677
but one person assured of victory

22:16.843 --> 22:18.678
kind of undermines the whole idea

22:18.843 --> 22:20.095
of democracy, don't you think?

22:20.236 --> 22:21.154
But, Mr. M...

22:21.279 --> 22:23.156
I mean, that'd be more
like a dictatorship

22:23.281 --> 22:24.657
like we studied.

22:24.759 --> 22:25.676
But, Mr. M, there's...

22:25.759 --> 22:27.719
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?

22:27.891 --> 22:30.268
Pears.

22:30.456 --> 22:32.167
Pears. Good. OK.

22:32.284 --> 22:33.202
Let's say...

22:33.285 --> 22:35.245
Oh, no, wait.

22:35.416 --> 22:36.751
Apples.

22:36.895 --> 22:38.188
Apples.

22:38.286 --> 22:39.245
Fine.

22:39.330 --> 22:42.625
Let's say all you
ever knew were apples.

22:42.810 --> 22:45.646
Apples, apples, more apples.

22:45.812 --> 22:47.688
You might think apples
were pretty good,

22:47.812 --> 22:50.648
even if you got a rotten
one once in a while.

22:50.813 --> 22:52.189
But then one day...

22:52.292 --> 22:53.710
there's an orange.

22:53.814 --> 22:55.691
And now you can
make a decision.

22:55.814 --> 22:57.191
Do you want an apple

22:57.294 --> 22:59.170
or do you want an orange?

22:59.294 --> 23:00.962
That's democracy.

23:01.122 --> 23:03.082
I also like bananas.

23:04.297 --> 23:06.132
Exactly. Good.

23:06.253 --> 23:07.672
So what do you say?

23:07.820 --> 23:10.573
Maybe it's time to give
a little something back.

23:10.778 --> 23:12.196
How's that?

23:12.344 --> 23:13.720
I think that's...

23:13.822 --> 23:15.573
No. Just a little higher.
A little higher.

23:15.736 --> 23:16.904
Is this OK?

23:16.997 --> 23:20.084
Eric, you can't put tape
on the outside of the poster.

23:20.302 --> 23:22.137
It goes on the back
ofthe poster.

23:22.303 --> 23:24.138
You better just take
the whole thing down

23:24.304 --> 23:25.639
and redo it.

23:30.307 --> 23:34.061
Aaah-a-a-aaaah

23:41.310 --> 23:42.603
Who put you up to this?

23:42.703 --> 23:44.038
Oh, hi, Tracy.

23:44.182 --> 23:45.267
Who put you up to this?

23:45.356 --> 23:46.482
What do you mean?

23:46.618 --> 23:47.702
You just woke up this morning

23:47.836 --> 23:50.004
and suddenly decided
to run for president?

23:50.184 --> 23:53.604
No. Um, no,
I just thought that, uh...

23:53.837 --> 23:54.922
Thought what?

23:55.055 --> 23:58.142
Well, I was talking to
Mr. McAllister about my leg

23:58.361 --> 24:00.655
and how I still want to do
something for the school and...

24:00.840 --> 24:02.759
So Mr. McAllister
asked you to run.

24:02.884 --> 24:05.720
Well, um, I talked to him
and everything,

24:05.887 --> 24:07.221
but he just said that he thought

24:07.365 --> 24:08.699
it would be a good idea

24:08.844 --> 24:11.054
and how there's all different
kinds of fruits and, uh...

24:11.236 --> 24:13.405
It's nothing against you, Tracy.

24:13.541 --> 24:15.210
I mean, you're the best.

24:15.368 --> 24:17.203
Uh, I just thought, uh...

24:17.369 --> 24:18.245
OK.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.329
You're on, Mr. Popular.

24:22.284 --> 24:24.161
You might think it
upset me that Paul Metzler

24:24.284 --> 24:25.661
had decided to run against me,

24:25.763 --> 24:28.141
but nothing could be
further from the truth.

24:28.285 --> 24:29.704
He was no competition for me.

24:29.765 --> 24:31.683
It was like apples and oranges.

24:32.853 --> 24:34.646
I had to work
a little harder, that's all.

24:34.811 --> 24:36.688
You see,
I believe in the voters.

24:36.811 --> 24:37.979
They understand that elections

24:38.073 --> 24:39.866
aren't just popularity contests.

24:41.030 --> 24:42.657
They know this country was built

24:42.813 --> 24:45.649
by people just like me
who work very hard

24:45.814 --> 24:47.691
and don't have everything
handed to them

24:47.815 --> 24:49.066
on a silver spoon.

24:50.773 --> 24:53.150
Not like some rich kids
who everybody likes

24:53.295 --> 24:55.172
because their fathers
own Metzler Cement

24:55.295 --> 24:57.172
and give them trucks
on their 16th birthday

24:57.298 --> 24:59.258
and throw them big parties
all the time.

24:59.428 --> 25:01.513
No. They don't ever
have to work for anything.

25:01.689 --> 25:03.191
They think they can just,
all of a sudden,

25:03.342 --> 25:05.219
one day out ofthe blue
waltz right in

25:05.344 --> 25:06.720
with no qualifications whatsoever

25:06.822 --> 25:08.240
and try to take away

25:08.345 --> 25:09.721
what other people have worked for

25:09.823 --> 25:12.659
very, very hard their entire lives!

25:12.825 --> 25:13.742
No!

25:13.825 --> 25:15.702
Didn't bother me at all!

25:17.348 --> 25:18.725
Paul.

25:18.828 --> 25:20.162
Paul power.

25:22.307 --> 25:23.183
Paul...

25:23.308 --> 25:25.143
Paul for president.

25:25.308 --> 25:26.685
Paul for president.

25:26.787 --> 25:28.164
Promise.

25:28.309 --> 25:30.144
Progress.

25:30.310 --> 25:32.270
Peanut.

25:51.275 --> 25:53.819
There's a place I know

25:56.319 --> 25:59.698
Whereyou can look down

26:02.235 --> 26:06.072
The air makes you feel light

26:08.325 --> 26:10.160
The air makes you feel right

26:10.325 --> 26:11.201
What?

26:11.326 --> 26:13.620
I told you. I can't.

26:13.805 --> 26:16.141
It just doesn't
feel right anymore.

26:18.328 --> 26:19.704
But I love you.

26:22.504 --> 26:23.755
I said no.

26:24.853 --> 26:27.564
Hey, Tammy, guess
what happened today.

26:27.767 --> 26:29.603
Don't you fucking knock?

26:29.768 --> 26:31.895
Yeah. Oh, hi, Lisa.

26:31.986 --> 26:33.112
Get out, Paul!

26:33.248 --> 26:34.457
Listen. So Mr. McAllister,

26:34.596 --> 26:35.722
he calls me in,
and he tells me...

26:35.857 --> 26:37.108
I gotta go.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.474
You dumb shit!

26:40.598 --> 26:42.100
What'd I do?

26:42.250 --> 26:45.086
It's not like
I'm a lesbian or anything.

26:45.252 --> 26:46.629
I'm attracted to the person.

26:46.775 --> 26:49.569
It's just that all the people
I've ever been attracted to

26:49.776 --> 26:51.152
happen to be girls.

26:52.777 --> 26:54.153
Lisa, wait!

26:57.300 --> 26:58.176
Stop!

27:02.302 --> 27:03.178
What?

27:03.302 --> 27:04.637
Where you going?

27:04.781 --> 27:07.117
I'm not like you, OK?

27:07.304 --> 27:09.098
What do you mean?

27:09.217 --> 27:10.636
I'm not a dyke.

27:10.784 --> 27:12.661
And we're not in love.

27:12.785 --> 27:14.661
We were just...

27:14.785 --> 27:16.370
experimenting.

27:29.225 --> 27:32.562
How can something
that seemed so true

27:32.750 --> 27:35.586
turn out to be such a lie?

27:41.231 --> 27:44.025
Lisa and I were destined
to be together.

27:44.232 --> 27:46.609
Of all the people in the planet
who had ever lived,

27:46.754 --> 27:48.631
somehow we'd found each other.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.631
It was like a miracle.

27:53.758 --> 27:55.635
We had so much fun together,

27:55.758 --> 27:57.635
like the time we ate
a bunch of asparagus

27:57.759 --> 28:00.011
to see how long it takes
before your pee smells funny.

28:01.674 --> 28:03.175
It was very scientific.

28:03.282 --> 28:04.825
For me, it was 11 minutes.

28:04.936 --> 28:06.980
For her, it was 17.

28:08.284 --> 28:10.954
Every day I found a new way
to tell Lisa

28:11.111 --> 28:13.656
how much I loved her.

28:13.808 --> 28:15.226
"If you died right now,

28:15.374 --> 28:18.168
I would throw myself under
one of my dad's cement trucks

28:18.375 --> 28:21.044
and get poured into your tomb."

28:23.769 --> 28:26.063
But it just seemed
like the closer we got,

28:26.248 --> 28:28.041
the more she pulled away.

28:28.205 --> 28:29.831
Are you crazy?

28:29.988 --> 28:30.864
What?

28:30.988 --> 28:32.114
These are private.
These are for us.

28:32.250 --> 28:33.209
So?

28:33.295 --> 28:35.046
But other people
can see them, too.

28:35.164 --> 28:36.457
I don't care.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.143
Well, I do.

28:41.297 --> 28:44.092
What did I do
to make her change?

28:45.777 --> 28:47.153
What's wrong with me?

28:50.301 --> 28:52.136
Sometimes when I'm sad,

28:52.301 --> 28:55.096
I sit and watch
the power station.

28:55.303 --> 28:58.556
They say if you lie between
2 of the main wires,

28:58.783 --> 29:00.618
your body just evaporates.

29:00.783 --> 29:02.619
You become a gas.

29:02.784 --> 29:05.620
I wonder what that
would feel like.

29:12.832 --> 29:14.667
I don't know why,

29:14.832 --> 29:17.627
but Lisa decided
she wanted to hurt me.

29:17.833 --> 29:20.628
And she knew exactly what to do.

29:22.966 --> 29:25.135
I sure was surprised
the day Lisa Flanagan

29:25.314 --> 29:28.484
asked me for a ride home
and ended up blowing me.

29:29.838 --> 29:32.132
I've wanted this for so long.

29:33.535 --> 29:35.829
I mean, life is so weird.

29:36.014 --> 29:38.642
First, Lisa has a big fight
with my sister,

29:38.841 --> 29:42.428
and the next thing you know,
she's my girlfriend.

29:42.669 --> 29:45.171
Since Lisa knew all about
public relations and stuff,

29:45.366 --> 29:47.701
she offered to help me
with my campaign.

29:47.888 --> 29:49.681
We made a great team.

29:49.845 --> 29:52.640
It seemed so natural,
the two of us together.

29:52.846 --> 29:54.682
It was like a miracle.

29:57.240 --> 29:59.659
My leg wasn't bugging me too much

29:59.849 --> 30:01.226
and the weather was so nice.

30:01.372 --> 30:02.749
And every day after school

30:02.851 --> 30:06.647
Lisa and I would go to her house
to fuck and have a hot tub.

30:26.295 --> 30:28.172
If that's the way
they wanted it,

30:28.296 --> 30:30.047
then that's the way
it was gonna be.

30:30.210 --> 30:32.629
But I wasn't going down
without a fight.

30:39.344 --> 30:40.261
Tammy?

30:42.344 --> 30:44.555
Tammy, what are you doing?

30:44.736 --> 30:46.655
You're the advisor.
You should stop her.

30:46.824 --> 30:48.618
She's not qualified.
She's just a sophomore.

30:48.782 --> 30:49.700
Did you know that?

30:49.825 --> 30:51.535
Calm down, Tracy.
Just calm down.

30:51.652 --> 30:53.195
We can't both run, can we?

30:53.349 --> 30:54.600
I mean, we're brother and sister.

30:54.740 --> 30:55.741
Can we?

30:55.871 --> 30:57.748
It's a conflict of interest,
and Paul was first.

30:57.916 --> 31:00.210
Anybody who gets signatures
in on time can run,

31:00.352 --> 31:02.229
and she got in
just under the wire.

31:04.353 --> 31:06.522
These are a bunch of burnouts.

31:06.658 --> 31:08.702
And what's this one?
It's illegible.

31:08.877 --> 31:10.128
I can't even read that.

31:10.268 --> 31:12.187
That's Tim... Cobsa.

31:12.356 --> 31:14.734
She's doing this
to get back at me.

31:14.878 --> 31:15.796
For what?

31:15.879 --> 31:18.214
I mean, at you.

31:18.358 --> 31:19.776
For what?

31:19.881 --> 31:21.674
Tim Cobsa?

31:21.838 --> 31:24.716
Tim Cobsa? Who's he?
I've never even heard of him.

31:24.926 --> 31:26.678
Look, why don't we
just forget about Tammy?

31:26.840 --> 31:28.217
We'll have the assembly tomorrow.

31:28.319 --> 31:29.696
Everybody can make their speeches,

31:29.841 --> 31:32.177
and I'm sure everything's
gonna be just fine.

31:32.451 --> 31:33.243
Hey! Whee!

31:33.364 --> 31:35.658
Jim, don't.
You're scaring him.

31:35.844 --> 31:37.637
Nah. He likes it.

31:37.801 --> 31:38.718
Not that much.

31:38.845 --> 31:40.221
Around that time,

31:40.366 --> 31:42.202
Diane and I were
hanging out a lot

31:42.368 --> 31:43.536
at Linda Novotny's house,

31:43.630 --> 31:45.673
giving her our love and support

31:45.848 --> 31:49.226
and helping her make it
through a difficult time.

31:54.373 --> 31:56.708
Diane really wanted to have kids,

31:56.852 --> 31:58.103
and so did I,

31:58.201 --> 32:00.662
but it seemed like there
was always a reason to wait:

32:00.853 --> 32:02.688
She had to finish
nursing school,

32:02.854 --> 32:04.230
I had to get my master's,

32:04.376 --> 32:07.171
we needed a new house,
we needed more money.

32:07.377 --> 32:09.504
Finally, we just decided
to go for it.

32:09.769 --> 32:11.021
You gonna do it?

32:11.118 --> 32:12.495
You gonna do it?

32:12.597 --> 32:15.642
And for over a year,
we hadn't had any luck.

32:15.858 --> 32:18.152
Come on. Do it. Do it.

32:18.338 --> 32:20.173
Fill me up. Come on.

32:20.296 --> 32:22.173
Fill me up.

32:22.296 --> 32:23.673
Fill me up.

32:31.778 --> 32:32.695
OK.

32:38.303 --> 32:39.221
Good job.

32:47.306 --> 32:48.432
Say, Jim?

32:50.046 --> 32:51.464
Jim, can you get this?

32:51.613 --> 32:52.739
I can't.

32:52.831 --> 32:54.207
Oh, yeah, sure.

32:54.309 --> 32:56.186
Just put it on the table.

32:56.310 --> 32:57.228
All right.

33:01.791 --> 33:02.750
Without Dave around,

33:02.877 --> 33:04.712
Linda needed a lot of help
around the house.

33:04.834 --> 33:06.377
Where do you want it, here?

33:06.487 --> 33:07.405
No.

33:08.835 --> 33:10.212
More this way.

33:11.838 --> 33:13.381
Here?

33:13.490 --> 33:15.742
Uh, yeah. That's good.

33:18.884 --> 33:22.095
I had always liked Linda,
but we'd never had a chance

33:22.320 --> 33:24.697
to spend any time
alone together.

33:24.842 --> 33:26.802
Oughta warm you up a little bit.

33:26.974 --> 33:28.183
Now with Dave
out of the picture,

33:28.322 --> 33:30.157
I began to see what
an incredibly sensitive

33:30.322 --> 33:33.367
and giving person she was.

33:33.541 --> 33:35.918
We got to be
kind of like buddies.

33:36.065 --> 33:37.191
I even took her to the mall
one time

33:37.326 --> 33:39.245
while her car was in the shop.

33:42.328 --> 33:43.746
What do you think?

33:45.329 --> 33:46.914
You look great.

33:47.068 --> 33:49.654
I can't afford this stuff right now.

33:49.851 --> 33:51.603
Ah, come on.
You've had a hard year.

33:51.723 --> 33:53.683
You're cooped up
all the time with the kid.

33:53.854 --> 33:55.147
Let go. Live a little.

33:55.289 --> 33:56.165
You sure?

33:56.289 --> 33:57.165
Yeah.

33:59.856 --> 34:01.691
So what do you think?

34:01.857 --> 34:03.191
Should we get a room?

34:03.336 --> 34:04.712
Should we get a what?

34:17.862 --> 34:19.197
That's not funny.

34:27.301 --> 34:29.178
How'd it go?

34:29.303 --> 34:30.219
Fine.

34:30.303 --> 34:31.221
You know...

34:31.303 --> 34:33.179
just went to Westerly's.

34:33.304 --> 34:35.097
Did you guys have fun?

34:36.784 --> 34:38.202
Um...

34:38.304 --> 34:39.223
yeah.

34:39.306 --> 34:41.766
No, I mean... you know.

34:41.958 --> 34:44.295
What?

34:44.438 --> 34:46.690
Well, Linda's great,

34:46.831 --> 34:49.501
but she can be
a little bit much sometimes.

34:51.833 --> 34:53.083
Yeah.

34:53.224 --> 34:55.643
Oh, God.
Oh, just like that.

34:55.833 --> 34:56.751
Yeah.

34:56.879 --> 34:58.214
Fill me up.

34:58.358 --> 35:00.193
Fill me up.

35:00.359 --> 35:03.153
Oh... yeah.

35:03.316 --> 35:04.233
Fill me up.

35:05.839 --> 35:06.756
Oh, God.

35:06.839 --> 35:08.257
Just like that.

35:08.317 --> 35:09.527
Oh, yeah.

35:09.622 --> 35:10.707
Fill me up.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.926
God. Oh, God!

35:13.102 --> 35:15.188
Oh, God. Just like that.

35:15.363 --> 35:17.699
Do it, Jim. Fuck me.

35:17.842 --> 35:18.760
Do it, Jim.

35:18.843 --> 35:20.302
Just like that.

35:20.453 --> 35:23.080
Do it, Jim. Fill me up.

35:23.280 --> 35:25.616
Just like that.
Do it, Mr. M.

35:25.803 --> 35:28.431
Do it. Fuck me, Mr. M.
Fuck me!

35:28.630 --> 35:30.632
Fuck me hard, Mr. McAllister.

35:30.804 --> 35:31.680
Harder! Harder!

35:31.805 --> 35:34.641
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister.
Fuck me hard!

35:34.806 --> 35:37.141
Harder! Fuck me! Please!

35:38.850 --> 35:40.185
So like I was saying,

35:40.330 --> 35:42.206
things were going
pretty well in my life.

35:42.418 --> 35:44.670
That is, until things
started going all hay wire

35:44.854 --> 35:46.189
with that damn election.

35:46.332 --> 35:49.127
I love Carver High.

35:49.333 --> 35:52.628
And I will be a dedicated
vice president.

35:52.857 --> 35:56.110
A vote for Jerry Slavin is
a vote for good government.

35:56.336 --> 36:00.090
And even if I can't really
stand up for you, I will.

36:01.859 --> 36:02.944
Thank you.

36:08.384 --> 36:09.719
Thank you, Jerry.

36:09.864 --> 36:11.240
Thank you and good luck.

36:11.385 --> 36:14.555
Again, Jerry is running
unopposed for vice president.

36:14.779 --> 36:18.157
So, we'll move on now
to the presidential race

36:18.387 --> 36:19.722
with 3 candidates running.

36:19.866 --> 36:22.119
The first,
in alphabetical order,

36:22.302 --> 36:24.137
is Tracy Flick.

36:24.304 --> 36:25.180
Tracy?

36:32.393 --> 36:35.605
Poet Henry David Thoreau
once wrote,

36:35.829 --> 36:37.957
"I cannot make my days longer,

36:38.135 --> 36:40.095
so I strive to make them better."

36:40.223 --> 36:42.642
With this election,
we here at Carver

36:42.832 --> 36:44.167
also have an opportunity

36:44.312 --> 36:46.272
to make our
high school days better.

36:46.442 --> 36:49.612
During this campaign,
I've spoken with many of you

36:49.836 --> 36:51.170
about your many concerns.

36:51.315 --> 36:53.650
I spoke with Eliza Ramirez,

36:53.837 --> 36:56.172
a freshman who said
she feels alienated

36:56.316 --> 36:57.818
from her own home room.

36:57.925 --> 36:59.677
I spoke with sophomore Reggie Banks

36:59.839 --> 37:02.175
who said his mother works
in the cafeteria

37:02.362 --> 37:04.197
and can't afford to buy him
enough spiral notebooks

37:04.318 --> 37:05.236
for his classes.

37:05.320 --> 37:06.237
Eat me!

37:06.363 --> 37:07.739
Eat me raw!

37:12.844 --> 37:14.221
All right, now.

37:14.367 --> 37:16.661
Hey, ifyou can't be adults

37:16.845 --> 37:19.640
and give these candidates
the courtesy they deserve,

37:19.847 --> 37:22.642
then you don't deserve to be
called adults but children

37:22.761 --> 37:24.179
because that's what children are,

37:24.284 --> 37:26.160
and you'll be treated like children.

37:26.284 --> 37:28.662
So let's all listen up, huh?

37:32.808 --> 37:34.685
I care about Carver,

37:34.810 --> 37:36.687
and I care about each
and every one of you.

37:36.811 --> 37:39.230
And together, we can all
make a difference.

37:39.419 --> 37:42.631
When you cast your vote
for Tracy Flick next week,

37:42.812 --> 37:45.148
you won't just be voting for me.

37:45.292 --> 37:47.335
You'll be voting for yourself

37:47.466 --> 37:50.135
and for every other student
here at Carver.

37:50.293 --> 37:52.671
Our days might not be any longer,

37:52.816 --> 37:54.860
but they can sure be better.

37:54.991 --> 37:55.950
Thank you.

38:03.342 --> 38:06.637
The... The next candidate
for student body president

38:06.821 --> 38:08.239
is Paul Metzler.

38:08.344 --> 38:09.262
Paul?

38:11.823 --> 38:14.242
Woof woof woof woof
woof woof woof woof!.

38:17.827 --> 38:19.620
- Whoo!
- Hey, Paul!

38:19.740 --> 38:20.908
Paul!

38:40.314 --> 38:42.149
"As many of you know,

38:42.314 --> 38:44.150
I broke my leg pretty bad this year,

38:44.315 --> 38:46.150
and the experience
has made me reevaluate

38:46.316 --> 38:47.692
what I want to do with my life,

38:47.837 --> 38:49.214
and that is help people.

38:49.316 --> 38:50.693
When you think about it,

38:50.838 --> 38:52.298
a school is more than a school.

38:52.448 --> 38:54.200
It's our second home,
where we spend all our time

38:54.362 --> 38:57.156
and grow as individuals
in the community.

38:57.363 --> 38:59.199
But is our school
everything it could be?

38:59.364 --> 39:02.159
I want our school to reach
its true potential.

39:02.365 --> 39:03.700
That's why I'm running for president.

39:03.844 --> 39:05.679
I know what it is
to fight hard and win,

39:05.845 --> 39:07.680
like when we almost went
to State last fall

39:07.845 --> 39:10.640
and I threw the fourth quarter
pass against Westside

39:10.846 --> 39:12.681
for the touchdown that
won the game by 3 points.

39:12.847 --> 39:14.682
I won't let you down
like I didn't then,

39:14.848 --> 39:18.143
and I promise we can all score
a winning touchdown together.

39:18.372 --> 39:20.207
Vote Paul Metzler
for president.

39:20.372 --> 39:21.248
Thank you."

39:34.856 --> 39:36.191
OK, Paul.

39:36.334 --> 39:39.629
The final candidate for
student council president

39:39.859 --> 39:42.153
is another one
ofthe Metzler clan,

39:42.338 --> 39:43.714
sophomore Tammy Metzler.

39:43.860 --> 39:44.777
Tammy.

39:56.952 --> 39:58.620
Ha ha ha ha!

39:58.779 --> 40:01.156
People! People!

40:05.389 --> 40:09.310
Who cares about
this stupid election?

40:14.653 --> 40:16.739
We all know it doesn't matter

40:16.872 --> 40:19.208
who gets elected
president of Carver.

40:19.394 --> 40:22.648
Do you really think it's gonna
change anything around here,

40:22.830 --> 40:27.085
make one single person
smarter or happier

40:27.311 --> 40:29.188
or nicer?

40:29.312 --> 40:31.689
The only person
it does matter to

40:31.835 --> 40:33.712
is the one who gets elected.

40:33.836 --> 40:38.090
The same pathetic charade
happens every year,

40:38.316 --> 40:41.194
and everyone makes
the same pathetic promises

40:41.317 --> 40:43.235
just so they could put it
on their transcripts

40:43.361 --> 40:45.238
to get into college.

40:45.362 --> 40:46.739
So vote for me

40:46.840 --> 40:49.218
because I don't even
wanna go to college,

40:49.364 --> 40:50.740
and I don't care.

40:50.843 --> 40:53.679
And as president,
I won't do anything.

40:53.844 --> 40:57.639
The only promise I will make
is that, if elected,

40:57.845 --> 41:00.681
I will immediately dismantle
the student government

41:00.846 --> 41:02.722
so that none of us will
ever have to sit through

41:02.846 --> 41:04.890
one of these
stupid assemblies again!

41:09.414 --> 41:10.624
Whoo!

41:10.762 --> 41:11.930
Yeah!

41:12.068 --> 41:18.366
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy!
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy!

41:18.723 --> 41:19.974
Tammy! Tammy!

41:20.028 --> 41:22.822
Or don't vote for me!
Who cares?!

41:23.029 --> 41:24.280
Don't vote at all!

41:43.079 --> 41:44.497
Close the door.

41:45.776 --> 41:48.321
I tell you, that little bitch

41:48.517 --> 41:49.643
made a fool out of us.

41:49.735 --> 41:52.196
I want her out of this election.

41:52.388 --> 41:54.307
I mean, getting everybody
all riled up like that.

41:54.475 --> 41:56.102
She is washed up,
you understand me?

41:56.258 --> 41:57.217
She's finished.

41:57.347 --> 41:58.932
Well, we can't throw
her out of the election

41:59.086 --> 42:00.713
just because we
don't like her speech.

42:00.869 --> 42:04.081
That's not what student
government is about.

42:04.262 --> 42:06.223
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

42:06.393 --> 42:07.811
Look, all I know is

42:07.916 --> 42:09.960
she's a troublemaker,
she's on my list.

42:10.090 --> 42:11.759
All we need to do
is send a message.

42:11.917 --> 42:15.838
So maybe, uh, we should
just suspend her.

42:17.701 --> 42:21.747
That's it. 3 days,
she's suspended for 3 days.

42:25.792 --> 42:27.961
Being suspended is
like getting a paid vacation.

42:28.140 --> 42:30.226
Why do they think
it's a punishment?

42:30.403 --> 42:32.322
It's like your dog
pees on the carpet

42:32.447 --> 42:34.157
and you give him a treat.

42:34.317 --> 42:36.110
Then you get in trouble
for skipping school.

42:36.274 --> 42:37.900
It's so stupid.

42:38.058 --> 42:40.018
Hendricks told me,
"One more time"

42:40.146 --> 42:43.399
and I'd be expelled.
Sounded good to me.

43:43.388 --> 43:46.057
Oh, hi, Tammy.

43:47.999 --> 43:49.292
What do you want?

43:49.390 --> 43:51.350
Well, I went to all your teachers

43:51.521 --> 43:52.772
and got your assignments for you.

43:52.913 --> 43:55.290
I... I just thought, you know,

43:55.436 --> 43:56.354
last time you got suspended

43:56.480 --> 43:57.356
you fell so far behind,

43:57.480 --> 43:58.356
and I just didn't want

43:58.481 --> 43:59.857
to see that happen again.

43:59.916 --> 44:01.835
Thanks, Paul. Thanks a lot.

44:01.960 --> 44:03.837
Sure. You bet.

44:05.614 --> 44:07.115
Now could you leave me alone?

44:07.223 --> 44:09.517
Oh, yeah. Um,

44:09.701 --> 44:12.287
Tammy, there's just
one other thing.

44:12.486 --> 44:14.780
You know all
this election stuff,

44:14.921 --> 44:16.798
'cause everybody's
saying it's really weird

44:16.923 --> 44:17.882
that you're running against me

44:17.966 --> 44:19.593
and everything,
and it is kind of weird.

44:19.749 --> 44:22.085
You haven't really told me
why you're doing it

44:22.272 --> 44:23.690
and you didn't
tell me in advance,

44:23.839 --> 44:26.758
but that's OK.
I respect your privacy,

44:26.970 --> 44:29.305
it's just...
I want you to know

44:29.449 --> 44:30.658
that no matter who wins,

44:30.798 --> 44:32.925
you or me,
there's no hard feelings.

44:33.102 --> 44:35.438
We're still brother
and sister, OK,

44:35.582 --> 44:36.541
even though you're adopted,

44:36.625 --> 44:40.253
'cause I hope you feel the same.

44:44.281 --> 44:46.032
What happened
at the speeches

44:46.195 --> 44:48.322
was an unconscionable travesty.

44:48.457 --> 44:50.125
That little bitch Tammy Metzler

44:50.283 --> 44:51.535
wanted to make a fool out of me.

44:51.675 --> 44:54.094
Well, it wasn't gonna work.

44:54.284 --> 44:56.829
Ifall those students
who cheered for Tammy Metzler

44:56.981 --> 44:59.067
only knew how hard
I worked for Carver,

44:59.243 --> 45:01.495
like all the late nights
I spend at the year book office

45:01.635 --> 45:03.637
just to give them
their stinking memories.

45:09.160 --> 45:11.746
One of my duties was
to clean up the group photos.

45:11.943 --> 45:15.238
It was a cinch
with our new software.

45:17.119 --> 45:20.247
People are so ungrateful.

46:29.625 --> 46:34.005
Ahh-a-a-aah, aaah-a-a-aaah

46:52.375 --> 46:54.460
Aaagh! Aaagh!

46:54.637 --> 46:57.931
Aaagh!

48:49.898 --> 48:51.691
The day before the election

48:51.856 --> 48:55.317
was when things started
to get really complicated.

48:55.509 --> 48:57.011
There's your culprit.

48:57.161 --> 49:00.373
Linda had asked me to stop by
on my way to school

49:00.598 --> 49:04.060
to help her out with
a little plumbing problem.

49:04.294 --> 49:06.922
Did you know Dave's a bed-wetter?

49:07.122 --> 49:10.584
No. No, I... I didn't know that.

49:10.819 --> 49:12.863
All his life.
He's tried everything.

49:16.604 --> 49:19.190
Is that still running clear?

49:19.387 --> 49:20.346
Yeah.

49:20.476 --> 49:22.144
Better let it run for a while.

49:22.301 --> 49:24.137
OK.

49:24.302 --> 49:26.513
Oh, wait.

49:26.695 --> 49:29.823
Here. This one's clean.

49:33.611 --> 49:35.487
I guess you better
get to work, huh?

49:35.655 --> 49:37.156
You're gonna be late.

49:37.308 --> 49:39.727
Yeah.

49:49.921 --> 49:52.340
Thank you, Jim.

50:05.406 --> 50:07.659
It was something
that just happened.

50:07.797 --> 50:09.716
Neither of us expected it.

50:09.886 --> 50:11.555
Neither of us planned it.

50:11.669 --> 50:15.090
But once we started, we knew
there was no turning back.

50:15.278 --> 50:18.823
It was a miracle.

50:19.064 --> 50:20.857
Oh, Jim.

50:31.895 --> 50:34.397
Hey, take me to that motel,

50:34.592 --> 50:35.676
like you wanted.

50:35.810 --> 50:37.395
Now?

50:37.549 --> 50:39.217
Um, come by after school.

50:39.376 --> 50:40.794
I'll leave Darryl with a sitter.

50:40.941 --> 50:43.694
Oh. 3:25.

50:43.898 --> 50:45.859
OK, 3:25.

50:55.164 --> 50:56.248
What had blossomed

50:56.339 --> 50:58.132
between Linda and me
was too real,

50:58.296 --> 51:00.089
too powerful to deny.

51:00.209 --> 51:01.794
For the first time in years,

51:01.949 --> 51:04.494
I felt free and alive.

51:09.691 --> 51:10.567
Hiya, Jim.

51:33.396 --> 51:35.982
It's not fair,
it's just not fair.

51:36.180 --> 51:37.556
I just don't think somebody

51:37.703 --> 51:39.371
would do something
like that on purpose.

51:39.528 --> 51:41.739
It must be some
sort of mistake,

51:41.879 --> 51:43.797
like a maintenance thing.

51:43.966 --> 51:46.885
Jim, where the hell
have you been?

51:47.054 --> 51:50.307
Nowhere. I... I don't
have any classes

51:50.534 --> 51:51.409
till second period.

51:51.534 --> 51:52.618
Well, I tried you at home,

51:52.709 --> 51:54.461
and we've got a situation here.

51:54.621 --> 51:55.956
If Paul loses
this election tomorrow,

51:56.058 --> 51:57.225
there has to be another one

51:57.363 --> 51:58.531
with posters.

51:58.624 --> 52:00.501
Somebody tore down their posters.

52:00.625 --> 52:02.126
Those posters cost
us a lot of money,

52:02.277 --> 52:03.403
and there's no time
to make any more.

52:03.538 --> 52:04.873
All right, we'll get
to the bottom of it.

52:05.016 --> 52:06.685
We still have some extra ones,
don't we?

52:06.844 --> 52:08.137
Maybe we could just use those.

52:08.237 --> 52:09.154
It was Tammy.

52:09.237 --> 52:10.155
That's who it was.

52:10.237 --> 52:12.156
Oh, no. Hey, like I said,

52:12.324 --> 52:13.784
she just wouldn't do
something like that.

52:13.935 --> 52:15.520
Well, that speech that she gave,

52:15.674 --> 52:16.884
you know, it was pretty...

52:17.022 --> 52:19.024
It was out there.

52:19.197 --> 52:20.449
But we'll get
to the bottom of it.

52:20.588 --> 52:22.882
I want you two to go back,

52:23.024 --> 52:24.901
I want you to focus on your studies.

52:25.024 --> 52:27.777
Mr. McAllister will handle
the whole thing.

52:27.939 --> 52:29.899
Right, Jim?

52:30.070 --> 52:33.866
What's that? Oh, yeah.
Sure, yeah, you bet.

52:42.598 --> 52:44.600
Tracy.

52:47.947 --> 52:50.825
Tracy, come on in.

52:51.036 --> 52:53.372
Close the door behind you.

52:59.300 --> 53:01.343
Have a seat.

53:05.258 --> 53:08.636
I guess you know
why you're here.

53:11.130 --> 53:12.340
If it's about the posters,

53:12.478 --> 53:13.604
I think it's awful.

53:13.741 --> 53:15.534
I think it's a travesty.

53:15.653 --> 53:16.988
Travesty, huh?

53:17.132 --> 53:20.260
Well, that's interesting,

53:20.481 --> 53:22.650
because I think you did it.

53:22.830 --> 53:24.915
What?

53:26.527 --> 53:28.529
Are you accusing me?

53:28.659 --> 53:30.160
You're not serious.

53:30.268 --> 53:32.061
Mr. McAllister,
we've worked together

53:32.182 --> 53:34.351
on the S.G.A. for 3 solid years.

53:34.487 --> 53:36.447
Besides, my own best banner
was torn down.

53:36.618 --> 53:37.911
Did I do that, too?

53:38.010 --> 53:39.345
Were you or were you not

53:39.489 --> 53:41.324
working in the Looking Glass Office

53:41.490 --> 53:42.407
over the weekend?

53:42.490 --> 53:46.077
I was. So?
Mr. Paterno let me in.

53:46.317 --> 53:48.486
As you know, with my
many responsibilities,

53:48.667 --> 53:50.085
I often have to come in
on the weekend.

53:50.188 --> 53:52.149
And I have permission to do so.

53:52.320 --> 53:54.906
But I left very early,
around 6:30.

53:56.278 --> 53:59.865
6:30. 6:30?

54:00.106 --> 54:02.608
How do you know what time
the posters were torn down?

54:02.803 --> 54:05.347
I don't. I just know

54:05.542 --> 54:06.960
that they were there when I left.

54:07.108 --> 54:09.444
I'm giving you helpful
information, that's all.

54:09.588 --> 54:10.548
You know, instead
of wasting your time

54:10.675 --> 54:11.634
interrogating me,

54:12.981 --> 54:13.773
we should be out there

54:13.851 --> 54:14.977
trying to figure out
who did this.

54:15.069 --> 54:17.196
OK, Tracy.

54:17.330 --> 54:18.915
Who do you think did it?

54:19.070 --> 54:20.905
Whom should we interrogate?

54:21.028 --> 54:22.696
Well, I don't know.

54:22.853 --> 54:24.188
You know, it could
have been anybody.

54:24.332 --> 54:26.626
There's a lot of subversive
elements here at Carver,

54:26.812 --> 54:30.274
like Rick Thiessen or
Kevin Speck and those burnouts.

54:30.509 --> 54:31.552
Or what about Tammy Metzler?

54:31.683 --> 54:32.601
I mean, her whole thing

54:32.683 --> 54:34.894
is being anti-this and anti-that.

54:36.467 --> 54:39.512
Tracy, you're
a very intelligent girl.

54:39.729 --> 54:42.524
You have a lot of
admirable qualities.

54:42.687 --> 54:44.522
But one day maybe you'll learn

54:44.689 --> 54:45.690
that being smart

54:45.819 --> 54:48.364
and doing whatever you
need to do to get ahead

54:48.559 --> 54:50.060
and, yes, stepping
on other people

54:50.212 --> 54:51.463
to get there,

54:51.560 --> 54:55.147
well, there's a whole lot
more to life than that.

54:55.388 --> 54:57.891
And, in the end, you're
only cheating yourself.

54:59.216 --> 55:01.301
Why are you lecturing me?

55:01.477 --> 55:05.857
This isn't the time or
the place to get into it.

55:06.131 --> 55:08.342
But there is,
for just one example,

55:08.524 --> 55:10.443
a certain former colleague of mine

55:10.567 --> 55:14.113
who made a very big mistake,
a life mistake.

55:14.352 --> 55:15.728
Now, I think
the lesson here is that,

55:15.875 --> 55:19.420
old or young,
we all make mistakes.

55:19.658 --> 55:21.452
And we have to learn
that our actions,

55:21.573 --> 55:26.494
all of them, can carry
serious consequences.

55:26.748 --> 55:29.918
Mm-hmm. I don't know
what you're referring to,

55:30.096 --> 55:32.682
but maybe if certain
older, wiser people

55:32.882 --> 55:34.800
hadn't acted like such little babies

55:34.925 --> 55:36.051
and gotten so mushy,

55:36.187 --> 55:38.147
then everything would be OK.

55:38.274 --> 55:40.651
I agree, and I also think

55:40.840 --> 55:42.592
that certain young and naive people

55:42.754 --> 55:44.630
need to thank their lucky stars

55:44.799 --> 55:46.509
and be very, very grateful

55:46.668 --> 55:48.712
the entire school didn't find out

55:48.886 --> 55:50.221
about certain indiscretions

55:50.366 --> 55:52.701
that could've ruined
their reputations

55:52.889 --> 55:55.808
and their chances
to win certain elections.

55:56.021 --> 55:57.814
And I think
certain older people,

55:57.934 --> 55:59.852
like you and your colleague,

55:59.935 --> 56:01.854
shouldn't be letching
after their students,

56:01.979 --> 56:02.938
especially when some of them

56:03.023 --> 56:04.816
can't even get
their own wives pregnant,

56:04.980 --> 56:06.606
and they certainly shouldn't be

56:06.764 --> 56:09.058
making slanderous accusations,

56:09.243 --> 56:11.328
especially when certain
young, naive people's mothers

56:11.461 --> 56:12.754
are paralegal secretaries

56:12.896 --> 56:14.064
at the city's biggest law firm

56:14.158 --> 56:16.369
and have won many
successful lawsuits.

56:16.506 --> 56:18.884
And if you want to keep
questioning me like this,

56:19.072 --> 56:22.075
I won't continue
without my attorney present.

56:27.163 --> 56:29.332
You wanted to see me,
Mr. McAllister?

56:29.467 --> 56:31.636
Just wait outside, Tammy.

56:31.817 --> 56:34.611
OK, but is this
about the posters?

56:34.818 --> 56:37.362
Possibly. Please,
just wait outside.

56:37.514 --> 56:40.643
OK, because I know who did it.

56:40.820 --> 56:43.573
So, I'll just be outside.

56:47.213 --> 56:48.506
Don't go anywhere, Tracy.

56:48.650 --> 56:50.735
Tammy, come on in here.

56:52.347 --> 56:54.516
This ought to be good.

56:57.480 --> 56:59.565
So, what do you have
to tell me, Tammy?

56:59.698 --> 57:01.950
Well, this is hard for me,

57:02.089 --> 57:04.132
but I think it's
important to be honest,

57:04.308 --> 57:05.392
don't you?

57:05.526 --> 57:07.152
Yeah. What is it, Tammy?

57:07.310 --> 57:12.231
I did it. I'm the one
who tore down Paul's posters.

57:12.529 --> 57:14.906
I did it.

57:15.051 --> 57:16.385
When did you do it?

57:16.530 --> 57:19.157
I don't know...
Yesterday, Sunday.

57:19.357 --> 57:21.734
How'd you get into the school?

57:23.228 --> 57:24.479
Door was open.

57:24.621 --> 57:26.414
Which door?

57:26.534 --> 57:29.078
I don't know.
All I know is I did it.

57:29.231 --> 57:31.108
Well, I don't believe you.

57:31.231 --> 57:32.816
I have proof.

57:45.715 --> 57:48.968
Aaah-a-a-aaah

57:49.195 --> 57:52.865
Aaah-a-a-aaaah

57:54.110 --> 57:56.612
Aaah-a-a-a-aaaah

57:59.634 --> 58:00.551
Tracy?

58:00.634 --> 58:02.052
Yes?

58:02.112 --> 58:04.073
Looks like today's your lucky day.

58:04.244 --> 58:05.453
You're off the hook.

58:05.592 --> 58:08.220
Tammy here has confessed.

58:19.076 --> 58:21.621
I told you.

58:21.816 --> 58:22.859
I told you.

58:22.948 --> 58:24.991
You're gonna pay for my poster!

58:25.166 --> 58:26.250
OK, easy, now, now,

58:26.384 --> 58:27.259
quit while you're ahead,

58:27.384 --> 58:28.844
will you, Tracy?
Just run along.

58:28.949 --> 58:30.409
Back to class.

58:30.515 --> 58:32.600
The rest of
the day was unbearable.

58:32.777 --> 58:36.072
I kept smelling Linda
on my clothes and my fingers,

58:36.300 --> 58:38.803
and I just couldn't wait
to get out of there.

58:41.128 --> 58:43.380
I wanted everything to be perfect

58:43.521 --> 58:44.980
that afternoon at the motel.

58:45.129 --> 58:46.505
So I decided to give myself

58:46.653 --> 58:48.863
a little time to prepare
during eighth period.

58:49.001 --> 58:50.627
Pop quiz, everybody.

58:52.306 --> 58:54.725
Put your stuff away.
Come on, no whining.

58:54.872 --> 58:56.874
If you've done your reading,
this should be an easy one.

58:58.787 --> 59:00.706
I'd have exactly 48 minutes

59:00.875 --> 59:01.918
to make all the arrangements.

59:02.049 --> 59:03.175
If you finish early,
just sit quietly

59:03.311 --> 59:05.897
and check your work.
I'll be right back.

01:00:23.994 --> 01:00:26.455
OK, everybody.
Pass 'em forward.

01:00:26.603 --> 01:00:28.981
Stephanie, put
your pen down. Stop.

01:00:30.258 --> 01:00:32.051
All right, see you
all on Wednesday.

01:00:32.215 --> 01:00:33.967
Don't forget to vote tomorrow.

01:01:14.536 --> 01:01:16.371
Linda.

01:01:18.799 --> 01:01:20.550
Linda.

01:01:24.757 --> 01:01:27.051
Linda!

01:01:35.718 --> 01:01:37.261
Linda!

01:01:38.676 --> 01:01:40.678
Linda.

01:01:47.983 --> 01:01:50.110
Ow!

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:55.502
Ow. Jesus.

01:01:55.770 --> 01:01:58.564
Oh, fuck.

01:02:06.773 --> 01:02:08.358
Hi. You've reached the Novotnys.

01:02:08.469 --> 01:02:10.388
We're not around, but
we'll call you back real soon.

01:02:10.514 --> 01:02:12.432
Have a nice day.

01:02:12.602 --> 01:02:14.854
Hey, Linda, it's me.

01:02:14.995 --> 01:02:16.413
Are you there? Pick up.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:21.148
Um, OK, well,
it's, uh, it's 4:32,

01:02:21.432 --> 01:02:26.478
and, uh, I came by at 3:25,
like we said,

01:02:26.781 --> 01:02:29.700
and, uh, I waited
there, but, um,

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:33.416
you weren't there, so, so now

01:02:33.654 --> 01:02:36.490
I'm at... at the place
that we talked about,

01:02:36.654 --> 01:02:39.574
suite 246,

01:02:39.786 --> 01:02:44.249
and I'm here.
Everything's all set,

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:47.863
so, uh, hope you get here soon.

01:02:48.094 --> 01:02:50.263
OK. Bye-bye.

01:02:56.097 --> 01:02:59.017
I don't get it.
I just don't get it.

01:02:59.184 --> 01:03:01.562
What you have against
your mother and me,

01:03:01.709 --> 01:03:05.129
against your brother Paul,
is completely beyond me.

01:03:05.361 --> 01:03:07.238
Your mother's extremely upset,

01:03:07.362 --> 01:03:09.238
she's at the end of her rope.

01:03:09.362 --> 01:03:11.823
Your behavior keeps
getting crazier and crazier

01:03:12.015 --> 01:03:13.767
and wilder and wilder.

01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:15.598
Who knows what the hell else
you're doing out there

01:03:15.756 --> 01:03:18.592
that we don't even know about.

01:03:18.757 --> 01:03:20.801
We just had a long conversation

01:03:20.975 --> 01:03:22.810
with Walt Hendricks.

01:03:22.933 --> 01:03:25.853
Just got off the phone
with him at his home.

01:03:26.022 --> 01:03:28.107
You know he doesn't
want you back at Carver.

01:03:28.283 --> 01:03:31.328
He's fed up with you.
Fed up,

01:03:31.545 --> 01:03:32.421
and I don't blame him.

01:03:32.546 --> 01:03:34.673
- Dick, Dick.
- What?

01:03:34.851 --> 01:03:36.144
Tammy, your father and I

01:03:36.243 --> 01:03:37.161
have been talking,

01:03:37.243 --> 01:03:39.078
and we've come to
a decision that we...

01:03:39.244 --> 01:03:41.454
You're going
to Immaculate Heart.

01:03:41.593 --> 01:03:43.387
That's where you belong.

01:03:43.550 --> 01:03:47.095
Maybe the nuns will be able
to straighten you out.

01:03:47.334 --> 01:03:50.253
Is that funny?
You think it's funny?

01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:23.295
OK.

01:06:14.348 --> 01:06:15.849
Dear Lord Jesus,

01:06:16.001 --> 01:06:18.587
I do not often speak with You
and ask for things,

01:06:18.741 --> 01:06:20.285
but now I really must insist

01:06:20.438 --> 01:06:22.273
that You help me
win the election tomorrow,

01:06:22.395 --> 01:06:24.772
because I deserve it
and Paul Metzler doesn't,

01:06:24.917 --> 01:06:26.836
as You well know.

01:06:26.961 --> 01:06:28.713
I realize that
it was Your divine hand

01:06:28.876 --> 01:06:30.335
that disqualifiied Tammy Metzler,

01:06:30.485 --> 01:06:33.279
and now I'm asking
that You go that one last mile

01:06:33.442 --> 01:06:35.903
and make sure to put me
in offiice where I belong

01:06:36.095 --> 01:06:37.930
so that I may carry out
Your will on Earth

01:06:38.097 --> 01:06:41.058
as it is in heaven. Amen.

01:06:41.271 --> 01:06:42.314
Dear God,

01:06:42.447 --> 01:06:43.823
I know I don't believe in You,

01:06:43.968 --> 01:06:45.637
but since I'll be starting
Catholic school soon,

01:06:45.795 --> 01:06:47.797
I thought I should
at least practice.

01:06:47.927 --> 01:06:50.346
Let's see, what do I want?

01:06:50.535 --> 01:06:52.829
I want Lisa to realize
what a bitch she is

01:06:53.015 --> 01:06:54.725
and feel really bad and apologize

01:06:54.885 --> 01:06:56.053
for how she hurt me

01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:58.151
and know how much
I still love her.

01:06:58.322 --> 01:07:00.741
In spite of everything,
I still want Paul

01:07:00.931 --> 01:07:01.932
to win the election tomorrow,

01:07:02.062 --> 01:07:05.357
not that cunt Tracy.
Oh, and I also want

01:07:05.585 --> 01:07:07.504
a really expensive
pair ofleather pants,

01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:09.048
and someday I want to be

01:07:09.152 --> 01:07:13.115
really good friends
with Madonna. Love, Tammy.

01:07:13.371 --> 01:07:14.956
Dear God, thank You

01:07:15.111 --> 01:07:16.237
for all Your blessings.

01:07:16.372 --> 01:07:17.832
You've given me so many things,

01:07:17.981 --> 01:07:21.360
like good health,
nice parents, a nice truck,

01:07:21.591 --> 01:07:23.426
and what I'm told
is a large penis,

01:07:23.592 --> 01:07:25.218
and I'm very grateful.

01:07:25.332 --> 01:07:27.376
But I sure am worried
about Tammy.

01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:29.218
In my heart
I still can't believe

01:07:29.378 --> 01:07:30.713
she tore down my posters,

01:07:30.812 --> 01:07:33.607
but sometimes she does
get so weird and angry.

01:07:33.813 --> 01:07:36.107
Please help her
be a happier person

01:07:36.292 --> 01:07:37.877
because she's
so smart and sensitive

01:07:38.033 --> 01:07:39.993
and I love her so much.

01:07:40.164 --> 01:07:43.083
Also, I'm nervous
about the election tomorrow

01:07:43.296 --> 01:07:45.256
and I guess
I want to win and all,

01:07:45.426 --> 01:07:47.595
but I know that's
totally up to You.

01:07:47.733 --> 01:07:49.610
You'll decide
who the best person is

01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:52.820
and I'll accept it,
and forgive me for my sins,

01:07:52.995 --> 01:07:56.373
whatever they may be. Amen.

01:08:02.433 --> 01:08:04.685
Linda never
came home that night.

01:08:04.869 --> 01:08:07.580
I know, because
I spent 10 hours

01:08:07.741 --> 01:08:09.909
waiting outside her house.

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.630
Oh, God.

01:08:58.238 --> 01:08:59.698
On election day,

01:08:59.846 --> 01:09:01.515
my mom and I got up really early,

01:09:01.674 --> 01:09:05.219
and together we
customized 480 cupcakes.

01:09:11.243 --> 01:09:13.120
Good morning, Mr. M.

01:09:16.941 --> 01:09:19.568
Looks like you could
use a cupcake.

01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:29.398
Hey, what happened to your eye?

01:09:34.295 --> 01:09:35.671
Are you OK?

01:09:35.817 --> 01:09:36.776
" Mr. McAllister,

01:09:38.166 --> 01:09:40.292
Mr. McAllister, somebody
tore down my posters.

01:09:40.471 --> 01:09:42.640
It's not fair, it's not fair.

01:09:42.776 --> 01:09:45.654
Can I have an 'A'?
Can I have a recommendation?

01:09:45.866 --> 01:09:47.868
Can I, can I?"

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.917
Fuck them.

01:10:11.093 --> 01:10:12.636
Hi. You've reached the Novotnys.

01:10:12.746 --> 01:10:14.664
We're not around, but we'll
call you back real soon.

01:10:14.833 --> 01:10:17.043
Have a nice day.

01:10:17.225 --> 01:10:20.771
Why did you do that?
I trusted you completely.

01:10:20.965 --> 01:10:22.884
And you ruined my life,
do you know that?

01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:25.890
Do you realize that?
Huh? Doyou?

01:10:26.099 --> 01:10:28.351
You ruined Diane's life...
You ruined my life,

01:10:28.534 --> 01:10:31.161
is that what you wanted?

01:10:31.318 --> 01:10:35.364
I'm sorry... I'm sorry,
I'm just... I'm going nuts here,

01:10:35.623 --> 01:10:38.751
and I really think we should talk.

01:10:38.929 --> 01:10:42.349
It'sJim. I love you.

01:10:49.019 --> 01:10:50.729
Attention, everyone.

01:10:50.847 --> 01:10:52.223
We have an important announcement

01:10:52.369 --> 01:10:55.539
from our principal,
Dr. Hendricks.

01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:00.191
Good morning, students.

01:11:00.372 --> 01:11:03.042
It, uh, behooves me to inform you

01:11:03.243 --> 01:11:05.203
ofan important change
in today's election.

01:11:05.374 --> 01:11:07.626
Effective this morning
sophomore Tammy Metzler

01:11:07.809 --> 01:11:09.561
has been... Metzler has been

01:11:09.723 --> 01:11:12.184
determined ineligible,
I repeat, ineligible

01:11:12.334 --> 01:11:13.877
for S.G.A. president.

01:11:13.986 --> 01:11:15.696
All other candidates
are eligible.

01:11:15.814 --> 01:11:18.900
You may, uh,
vote for any of those,

01:11:19.118 --> 01:11:21.121
but not Tammy Metzler.

01:11:22.598 --> 01:11:24.558
When the time
came to cast ourvotes,

01:11:24.642 --> 01:11:26.895
I stood in line
just like everyone else.

01:11:27.034 --> 01:11:27.952
Hi, Tracy.

01:11:28.035 --> 01:11:29.828
Tracy Enid Flick.

01:11:29.993 --> 01:11:30.952
I know.

01:11:32.167 --> 01:11:33.919
Thankyou.

01:11:45.346 --> 01:11:46.889
Ready, Phil?

01:11:47.042 --> 01:11:48.210
Yeah, ready.

01:11:56.351 --> 01:11:57.894
Thanks, Phil.

01:12:02.049 --> 01:12:03.759
Oh, hey, Tracy.

01:12:03.875 --> 01:12:05.085
Hi, Paul.

01:12:05.224 --> 01:12:07.101
Isn't this exciting?

01:12:07.268 --> 01:12:08.310
Mm-hmm.

01:12:08.443 --> 01:12:10.820
Well, good luck.

01:12:11.009 --> 01:12:13.386
Thanks, Paul. You, too.

01:12:13.531 --> 01:12:15.825
Oh, thanks!

01:12:21.969 --> 01:12:23.596
It's so weird.

01:12:23.708 --> 01:12:26.002
Do people always just
vote for themselves?

01:12:26.188 --> 01:12:29.066
'Cause looking at
my own name on the ballot

01:12:29.276 --> 01:12:31.653
I just... I don't know,

01:12:31.799 --> 01:12:34.844
I just felt like it's not right
to vote foryourself.

01:12:53.242 --> 01:12:54.369
Ok, Mr. M.

01:12:55.678 --> 01:12:58.598
All right. So...

01:12:58.765 --> 01:13:00.183
let's start counting.

01:13:00.288 --> 01:13:03.583
OK, well, as the election
committee chairman,

01:13:03.812 --> 01:13:04.854
I'll do the first count.

01:13:04.942 --> 01:13:06.485
And then you can do
the second count,

01:13:06.595 --> 01:13:08.055
you know, for
the 2 independent counts.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.621
Fine. So do your count.

01:13:10.815 --> 01:13:13.150
Start with president,
and I'll be right back.

01:13:13.294 --> 01:13:16.172
You have the key, Mr. McAllister.

01:13:19.427 --> 01:13:21.721
Right.

01:13:34.476 --> 01:13:36.978
Are you OK, Mr. McAllister?

01:13:37.173 --> 01:13:39.300
Yeah. What happened to your eye?

01:13:39.477 --> 01:13:42.022
I'm fiine!
It's just a bee sting.

01:13:42.218 --> 01:13:44.554
A simple little
everyday bee sting.

01:13:44.697 --> 01:13:47.534
Some people can get stung,
it's no big deal.

01:13:47.741 --> 01:13:49.701
Me... I swell up.

01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:52.333
There's not much time left
until eighth period.

01:13:52.483 --> 01:13:54.986
I have other things
going on, too, you know.

01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:59.142
Yeah. OK. We know.

01:13:59.399 --> 01:14:01.401
All right.
I'll be right back.

01:14:05.488 --> 01:14:07.532
Hi. You've reached the Novotnys.

01:14:07.662 --> 01:14:09.456
We're not around, but we'll
call you back real soon.

01:14:09.577 --> 01:14:10.661
Have a nice day.

01:14:12.186 --> 01:14:13.688
Uh, it's me again.

01:14:13.839 --> 01:14:16.925
I'm sorry for all
the messages, but, uh...

01:14:17.144 --> 01:14:18.645
Linda, if I could
just hear your voice.

01:14:18.797 --> 01:14:20.674
If you'd only acknowledge that I...

01:14:21.841 --> 01:14:22.717
What do you want, Jim?

01:14:22.842 --> 01:14:24.343
You're there.

01:14:24.495 --> 01:14:27.706
Yeah, I'm here.

01:14:27.888 --> 01:14:28.805
Linda, I love you.

01:14:29.932 --> 01:14:32.560
Don't say that.
You know it's not true.

01:14:32.715 --> 01:14:34.801
It's the only true thing
I know anymore.

01:14:34.978 --> 01:14:37.898
We made a mistake.
Let's not make it worse.

01:14:38.066 --> 01:14:40.610
A mistake?
That was no mistake!

01:14:40.805 --> 01:14:43.433
I was lonely.
You took advantage.

01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:47.802
Me?! I took advantage of you?

01:14:48.071 --> 01:14:50.364
You hugged me! You kissed me!
You're the one who...

01:14:57.987 --> 01:14:59.572
Hey, Mr. M, big day, huh?

01:14:59.726 --> 01:15:01.478
Not now, Paul.

01:15:06.729 --> 01:15:07.647
What have y ou got?

01:15:07.730 --> 01:15:10.149
Well, I'm not supposed to tell.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:12.174
Not until you've counted, too.

01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:13.341
We're each supposed to make

01:15:13.428 --> 01:15:14.512
an independent count.

01:15:14.602 --> 01:15:15.936
You're kidding, right?

01:15:16.081 --> 01:15:17.707
Well, I thought
those were the rules,

01:15:17.864 --> 01:15:18.740
Mr. McAllister.

01:15:18.864 --> 01:15:20.699
If they've changed
in anyway, I can...

01:15:20.821 --> 01:15:22.489
Larry, we're not electing
the fucking pope here.

01:15:22.605 --> 01:15:24.315
Just tell me who won.

01:15:30.087 --> 01:15:31.463
It's a squeaker, Mr. M.

01:15:31.609 --> 01:15:34.445
I've got Tracy by a vote.

01:15:34.609 --> 01:15:36.028
Just one vote.

01:15:44.135 --> 01:15:45.553
Mr. M?

01:15:47.963 --> 01:15:48.964
All right.

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:51.796
OK.

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:56.383
Well, guess I better do my count.

01:16:53.248 --> 01:16:55.083
Yay!

01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:57.585
Yay!

01:17:02.339 --> 01:17:03.924
Yay!

01:17:07.428 --> 01:17:10.223
I was at the end of
my count when it happened.

01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:14.184
I'd come up with exactly
the same numbers as Larry:

01:17:14.431 --> 01:17:17.017
256 to 257.

01:17:17.215 --> 01:17:19.884
Tracy had won the election
by a single vote.

01:17:23.347 --> 01:17:26.225
I was about to announce
my tally when...

01:17:33.786 --> 01:17:37.248
the sight of Tracy
at that moment affected me

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:39.317
in a way I can't fully explain.

01:17:39.441 --> 01:17:42.485
Part of it was that she was spying.

01:17:42.703 --> 01:17:45.706
But mostly it was her face.

01:17:49.097 --> 01:17:52.684
Who knew how high
she would climb in life?

01:17:52.924 --> 01:17:56.177
How many people would suffer
because of her?

01:17:56.404 --> 01:17:58.573
I had to stop her...

01:17:58.709 --> 01:18:00.795
now.

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:33.751
Larry?

01:18:33.853 --> 01:18:35.855
Yeah?

01:18:36.028 --> 01:18:38.280
I think we have a problem.

01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:41.632
253, 254, and 255.

01:18:41.856 --> 01:18:43.358
Yep, I get the same as you, Jim.

01:18:43.509 --> 01:18:45.302
Looks like Paul's
our next president.

01:18:45.423 --> 01:18:46.925
No way!

01:18:47.031 --> 01:18:48.408
It doesn't make sense.

01:18:48.555 --> 01:18:50.891
Well, sorry, Larry,
but my fiigures work out

01:18:51.077 --> 01:18:52.579
exactly the same
as Mr. McAllister's.

01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:56.983
I get, uh, 256 for Paul,
255 forTracy.

01:18:57.254 --> 01:19:00.299
And 290 disregards, right?

01:19:00.516 --> 01:19:01.475
If you say so.

01:19:01.603 --> 01:19:03.480
Mostly Tammy fans,
if you can believe it.

01:19:03.603 --> 01:19:04.980
See? It doesn't add up.

01:19:05.082 --> 01:19:08.377
There were 801 ballots,
but 803 people voted.

01:19:08.562 --> 01:19:09.730
Well, there must
be 2 votes missing.

01:19:09.867 --> 01:19:10.993
Check the register.

01:19:11.085 --> 01:19:13.087
He's right. 2 people must
have pocketed their ballots.

01:19:13.259 --> 01:19:14.803
Usually there's more.

01:19:14.956 --> 01:19:18.585
But they were there.
I counted 803 votes.

01:19:18.827 --> 01:19:21.121
It happens, Larry.
People make mistakes.

01:19:21.263 --> 01:19:22.806
I didn't make a mistake.

01:19:22.916 --> 01:19:25.085
Every vote was there
when you sat down.

01:19:25.264 --> 01:19:27.767
Easy, Falch. I don't
like where you're going.

01:19:27.961 --> 01:19:29.254
I'm sorry, Dr. Hendricks,

01:19:29.396 --> 01:19:31.398
but every vote
was accounted for.

01:19:31.572 --> 01:19:32.990
Falch, that's enough.

01:19:33.094 --> 01:19:35.304
End of story.

01:19:56.363 --> 01:19:57.573
Paul?

01:19:57.668 --> 01:20:00.671
I just want to let you know
that no matter what happens

01:20:00.887 --> 01:20:01.846
and how this turns out,

01:20:01.975 --> 01:20:04.019
you've run a really great campaign.

01:20:04.193 --> 01:20:05.695
Good luck.

01:20:05.802 --> 01:20:08.346
Well, thanks, Tracy.
You, too.

01:20:08.542 --> 01:20:10.627
I'm just glad it's over.

01:20:12.588 --> 01:20:14.048
If we can just get started.

01:20:14.153 --> 01:20:16.656
People. People.

01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:18.352
As soon as the winners
are announced,

01:20:18.502 --> 01:20:20.212
we can all go home, OK?

01:20:20.330 --> 01:20:23.249
Some contests are...

01:20:23.462 --> 01:20:26.548
are so well-fought
that it seems unfair

01:20:26.767 --> 01:20:27.851
for someone to win...

01:20:27.984 --> 01:20:31.321
Act surprised.
Walk slowly to the podium.

01:20:31.508 --> 01:20:34.845
Be modest. Thank them
for this incredible honor.

01:20:35.075 --> 01:20:37.244
They're all highly qualifiied

01:20:37.423 --> 01:20:41.844
and embody the, uh,
integrity that we expect

01:20:42.121 --> 01:20:44.331
from the school leadership.

01:20:44.513 --> 01:20:46.264
That said, the whole point
of an election

01:20:46.382 --> 01:20:48.843
is to chose a winner,
and that you have done.

01:20:48.993 --> 01:20:51.370
We'll begin with president.

01:20:51.516 --> 01:20:53.518
I'djust like to add

01:20:53.690 --> 01:20:55.734
that this was
an extraordinarily close race.

01:20:57.866 --> 01:21:00.369
It is my pleasure
to announce the next president

01:21:00.518 --> 01:21:02.937
of George Washington Carver
High School...

01:21:03.085 --> 01:21:05.546
Paul Metzler.

01:21:18.699 --> 01:21:20.535
Jeez, you guys, thanks.

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:24.734
Wow! Thanks.

01:21:24.876 --> 01:21:26.544
I promise to do my best

01:21:26.703 --> 01:21:30.790
and do a really good job
and be a good president.

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:33.221
I just want to thank,
uh, Lisa Flanagan

01:21:33.402 --> 01:21:34.653
for being a super campaign manager.

01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:37.711
I'd also like to say...

01:22:17.592 --> 01:22:19.343
It's Mr. M.

01:22:19.463 --> 01:22:22.383
Yes, over there. Yeah, come on.

01:22:26.075 --> 01:22:28.369
Wow, Mr. M.
This is so wild.

01:22:28.509 --> 01:22:30.053
We were just here, uh, you know,

01:22:30.206 --> 01:22:31.582
celebrating my victory,
and you're here.

01:22:31.684 --> 01:22:33.060
This is incredible.
This is great.

01:22:33.207 --> 01:22:34.583
Well, these are my parents.

01:22:34.685 --> 01:22:35.811
Hi, Dick Metzler.

01:22:35.948 --> 01:22:36.823
Jim McAllister.

01:22:36.948 --> 01:22:38.241
- Jo Metzler.
- How do you do?

01:22:38.382 --> 01:22:39.842
Paul just thinks
the world ofyou.

01:22:39.949 --> 01:22:40.908
I mean, you should hear him.

01:22:40.993 --> 01:22:42.244
He goes on and on and on.

01:22:42.341 --> 01:22:43.258
Yeah, apparently
you've really

01:22:43.386 --> 01:22:44.595
come behind him,
really helped him out

01:22:44.734 --> 01:22:45.860
with that student
council thing and all.

01:22:45.951 --> 01:22:48.412
Oh, well... well, Paul
doesn't need any help from me.

01:22:48.605 --> 01:22:50.732
He's... He's going places.
You should be very proud.

01:22:50.909 --> 01:22:51.785
Oh, we are.

01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:53.578
Hey, look, you're all alone.

01:22:53.737 --> 01:22:55.072
Why don't you come
over and join us?

01:22:55.172 --> 01:22:56.089
Yeah. Yeah, come on.

01:22:56.172 --> 01:22:57.799
Oh, I'm just fiinishing up here.

01:22:57.956 --> 01:22:59.249
I've gotta get home.

01:22:59.479 --> 01:23:00.688
Oh, well, uh,

01:23:00.827 --> 01:23:03.913
why don't you guys
go sit down, and, uh...

01:23:04.133 --> 01:23:05.884
you know, I'll catch up
with you in a minute.

01:23:06.002 --> 01:23:07.879
I'm going to talk to Mr. M
about some important stuff,

01:23:08.003 --> 01:23:08.920
all right?

01:23:09.003 --> 01:23:10.296
All right.
That sounds great.

01:23:10.396 --> 01:23:12.272
- Hey, sure nice to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

01:23:12.396 --> 01:23:13.898
- Pleasure.
- So nice, and thank you.

01:23:14.049 --> 01:23:15.384
You bet.

01:23:19.487 --> 01:23:21.072
So, Mr. M, I was starting
to think about,

01:23:21.226 --> 01:23:23.270
you know, some ideas
for what we could do.

01:23:23.444 --> 01:23:25.071
I was thinking
it would be cool

01:23:25.227 --> 01:23:26.145
to have a carnival.

01:23:26.227 --> 01:23:27.771
You know, with rides and stuff.

01:23:27.924 --> 01:23:30.009
And it could be for,
like, muscular dystrophy.

01:23:30.186 --> 01:23:33.272
And then on Halloween,
a haunted house.

01:23:33.491 --> 01:23:35.159
You know, a really
good haunted house,

01:23:35.318 --> 01:23:36.570
not those cheesy bad ones.

01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:37.752
You know, I mean,

01:23:37.884 --> 01:23:39.678
this one would be super-scary.

01:23:39.841 --> 01:23:41.551
And then for home coming,

01:23:41.713 --> 01:23:43.256
well, you know
how last year's theme

01:23:43.365 --> 01:23:45.784
was " Heaven On Earth"?
Well, this year...

01:23:45.975 --> 01:23:49.520
Paul, we'll have plenty of
time to talk about this later.

01:23:49.759 --> 01:23:52.303
A whole year, in fact.

01:23:52.498 --> 01:23:54.876
But right now, I'djust...

01:23:55.065 --> 01:23:57.150
I need to fiinish my pie,

01:23:57.327 --> 01:23:59.204
go on home.

01:23:59.371 --> 01:24:02.541
Yeah, OK. Sorry.

01:24:02.721 --> 01:24:05.599
Uh, Mr. M,
just one more thing.

01:24:05.808 --> 01:24:09.312
So, uh, do you think
Tracy's gonna be OK?

01:24:09.505 --> 01:24:11.841
I mean, I saw her face
after the assembly.

01:24:12.027 --> 01:24:14.238
It looked like she was
taking it pretty hard.

01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:16.756
Don't worry about Tracy.

01:24:16.942 --> 01:24:19.653
She'll be fiine.

01:24:33.254 --> 01:24:35.006
Oh, sweetheart.

01:24:37.952 --> 01:24:40.871
Oh, baby. Baby.

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:42.792
Oh, baby.

01:24:42.953 --> 01:24:45.038
Take one of my pills.

01:24:45.216 --> 01:24:48.010
You'll feel better.

01:24:48.217 --> 01:24:50.177
Here.

01:24:53.522 --> 01:24:57.109
Come on, baby. Come on.

01:24:57.307 --> 01:25:00.935
Lie down. Lie down.

01:25:01.178 --> 01:25:04.306
That's a good girl.
Lie down.

01:25:04.527 --> 01:25:07.155
Good girl.

01:25:07.353 --> 01:25:09.230
That's... That's it.

01:25:09.355 --> 01:25:11.023
That's it, baby.

01:25:11.138 --> 01:25:13.390
That's it, honey.

01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:21.096
Maybe you needed
more posters, honey.

01:25:21.317 --> 01:25:24.445
Or if you'djust
taken my suggestions

01:25:24.665 --> 01:25:26.375
about your speech.

01:25:26.492 --> 01:25:28.786
I don't know.

01:25:28.971 --> 01:25:30.848
We'll fiigure it out.

01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:44.464
Diane.

01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:47.883
I... I made a mistake and I...

01:25:55.851 --> 01:25:57.978
Did you want the same room?

01:25:59.984 --> 01:26:01.610
Yeah, OK.

01:26:29.385 --> 01:26:31.262
It's a beautiful day

01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:33.307
The next day, I woke up

01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:35.516
resolved to get
my life back on track.

01:26:35.693 --> 01:26:38.571
The way I saw it, Diane's
kicking me out of the house

01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:39.865
had been a good thing,

01:26:39.999 --> 01:26:41.250
a wake-up call.

01:26:41.391 --> 01:26:44.394
It wasn't a setback.
It was an opportunity.

01:26:44.567 --> 01:26:46.527
I fiigured we just
needed a little time

01:26:46.697 --> 01:26:48.366
to work things out.

01:26:48.524 --> 01:26:50.693
The election was behind me,

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:53.041
and the worst was over.

01:26:53.222 --> 01:26:55.307
After all, what harm
had really been done?

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.233
Nobody was dead.

01:27:02.747 --> 01:27:03.664
Jim?
Jim?!

01:27:03.747 --> 01:27:04.665
Yeah.

01:27:04.747 --> 01:27:06.249
Walt wants to seeyou.

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:08.444
OK, thanks.

01:27:19.928 --> 01:27:21.804
You r... rang?

01:27:25.104 --> 01:27:26.480
Mr. McAllister,

01:27:26.626 --> 01:27:29.086
I hope you can help us
clear something up.

01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:09.372
- Yo?
- Pierdo.

01:28:09.512 --> 01:28:11.306
- Tu?
- Pierdes.

01:28:11.469 --> 01:28:13.179
El, ella, usted?

01:28:13.339 --> 01:28:14.215
Pierde.

01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:15.508
Nosotros?

01:28:15.645 --> 01:28:17.146
Pierdemos.

01:28:17.298 --> 01:28:18.633
Gracias.

01:28:21.343 --> 01:28:23.220
Señor Presidente.

01:28:23.343 --> 01:28:26.930
Quieren verte enla ofiicina.

01:28:27.172 --> 01:28:29.090
Huh?

01:28:30.259 --> 01:28:31.635
Dr. Hendricks?

01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:37.137
Uh, come on in, son.
We have something...

01:28:37.261 --> 01:28:40.347
hard we have to tell you.

01:28:40.524 --> 01:28:41.442
Is it about Tammy?

01:28:41.524 --> 01:28:42.901
It's about the election.

01:28:46.570 --> 01:28:49.406
After Paul
got the bad news,

01:28:49.570 --> 01:28:51.572
Walt asked for a few minutes
alone with me.

01:28:51.702 --> 01:28:54.246
It was very simple, really.

01:28:54.399 --> 01:28:56.318
I offered my resignation,

01:28:56.443 --> 01:28:58.904
and he accepted.

01:28:59.097 --> 01:29:02.558
Very quietly, it was
all over for Jim McAllister

01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:04.168
at Carver High.

01:29:08.057 --> 01:29:10.517
Suddenly everyone knew who I was...

01:29:10.710 --> 01:29:12.086
that corrupt teacher

01:29:12.232 --> 01:29:14.859
who had tried to crush
the dreams of an innocent girl.

01:29:15.015 --> 01:29:17.893
Overnight, all the good things
I had ever done in my life

01:29:18.104 --> 01:29:20.398
evaporated.

01:29:20.584 --> 01:29:23.086
Soon the wire services
picked up on the story.

01:29:23.237 --> 01:29:26.573
It was the kind of absurd news item
people E-mail each other

01:29:26.803 --> 01:29:29.764
or post on the bulletin
board at work.

01:29:29.979 --> 01:29:33.857
To top it all off, Diane had
started divorce proceedings.

01:29:34.110 --> 01:29:37.071
She was completely unforgiving
about the thing with Linda.

01:29:37.285 --> 01:29:39.829
In the end, she took
almost everything,

01:29:40.025 --> 01:29:41.735
including the house.

01:29:41.896 --> 01:29:43.898
I got the car.

01:30:00.164 --> 01:30:01.999
Then one day,

01:30:02.121 --> 01:30:04.165
I realized it was time
to get out of Omaha

01:30:04.296 --> 01:30:05.923
and move on.

01:30:12.255 --> 01:30:13.631
Senior year was great.

01:30:13.778 --> 01:30:17.615
Sure, I didn't get to
play ball or be president,

01:30:17.823 --> 01:30:20.993
but I got elected
homecoming king and prom king.

01:30:21.172 --> 01:30:23.550
I got into Nebraska,
like I wanted,

01:30:23.738 --> 01:30:25.073
and early rushed PhiDelts.

01:30:25.173 --> 01:30:26.967
And at the end of the year,
me and my buddies

01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:30.258
threw a bitchin' Mexican party
down at the cement plant.

01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:32.690
Shit, that was a good party.

01:30:32.915 --> 01:30:36.335
The only really bad thing
about senior year was Lisa.

01:30:36.569 --> 01:30:38.154
Right before Christmas,
she dumped me.

01:30:38.308 --> 01:30:40.477
One minute, she's
totally in love with me,

01:30:40.658 --> 01:30:44.411
and then boom, she goes after
my football buddy Randy.

01:30:44.659 --> 01:30:46.953
Sometimes I wonder
what would have happened

01:30:47.138 --> 01:30:48.932
if I had actually won
the election.

01:30:49.096 --> 01:30:50.639
Maybe my whole life
would be different.

01:30:50.793 --> 01:30:53.629
Like I might never
have gone to Yosemite

01:30:53.794 --> 01:30:55.504
with Greg and Travis.

01:30:55.619 --> 01:30:57.580
Or maybe I'd be dead.

01:30:57.751 --> 01:31:00.587
Alleluia

01:31:00.796 --> 01:31:02.714
Catholic school
was great.

01:31:04.667 --> 01:31:07.920
I mean, the teachers
kind of sucked,

01:31:08.104 --> 01:31:10.523
and they were supposedly
way more strict.

01:31:10.669 --> 01:31:13.005
But you could get away
with murder.

01:31:13.192 --> 01:31:16.028
The best thing
about Immaculate Heart

01:31:16.193 --> 01:31:18.321
was meeting Jennifer.

01:31:18.455 --> 01:31:22.251
JenniferJuniper

01:31:22.456 --> 01:31:25.543
Lives up on the hill

01:31:25.762 --> 01:31:29.641
JenniferJuniper

01:31:29.895 --> 01:31:32.105
Sitting very still

01:31:33.331 --> 01:31:35.207
Is she sleeping

01:31:35.331 --> 01:31:36.707
Jennifer and I
are soul mates

01:31:36.853 --> 01:31:39.939
and we're never, ever,
ever going to be apart.

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:44.289
JenniferJuniper

01:31:44.509 --> 01:31:47.678
Order! Order. Order!

01:31:47.902 --> 01:31:49.570
Senior year was
very productive for me.

01:31:49.728 --> 01:31:51.229
Let's vote on this issue.

01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:53.132
On top of a very successful
student council year,

01:31:53.295 --> 01:31:55.422
I was in the top
seventh percentile

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:56.768
of my graduating class.

01:31:56.861 --> 01:31:57.903
Opposed?

01:31:58.036 --> 01:31:59.245
And I got into Georgetown,
like I wanted,

01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:01.717
with scholarships.

01:32:01.906 --> 01:32:03.241
Approved.

01:32:05.082 --> 01:32:08.168
But sometimes I got lonely,
and I'd think about Dave.

01:32:08.345 --> 01:32:09.846
I missed our talks.

01:32:09.997 --> 01:32:12.332
Maybe it could have
worked out between us.

01:32:12.519 --> 01:32:13.603
I don't know.

01:32:13.737 --> 01:32:16.573
I wonder what he's doing now.

01:32:16.782 --> 01:32:20.703
Maybe he fiinally
fiinished his novel.

01:32:20.958 --> 01:32:25.212
But you know, even with
all my my riad accomplishments

01:32:25.438 --> 01:32:27.023
and bright future,

01:32:27.177 --> 01:32:29.930
somehow I just didn't feel
the way you're supposed to feel.

01:32:30.136 --> 01:32:32.054
Everybody else seemed so happy,

01:32:32.223 --> 01:32:36.477
planning big parties and
signing each other's yearbooks.

01:32:36.745 --> 01:32:38.789
Hardly anybody signed mine.

01:32:38.964 --> 01:32:40.800
You'd think as
student body president,

01:32:40.966 --> 01:32:42.509
I'd be the one
surrounded by friends.

01:32:42.662 --> 01:32:44.914
But it wasn't like that at all.

01:32:48.837 --> 01:32:51.590
Brittany Blake Fillmore.

01:32:51.795 --> 01:32:53.505
As far as
Mr. McAllister was concerned,

01:32:53.666 --> 01:32:56.335
you might be surprised,
but I hardly thought about him

01:32:56.537 --> 01:32:57.621
at all anymore.

01:32:57.754 --> 01:33:00.507
Besides, nobody had heard
from him in a long time.

01:33:00.712 --> 01:33:04.007
It was almost like he'd never
existed in the fiirst place.

01:33:04.236 --> 01:33:06.864
Tracy Enid Flick.

01:33:09.063 --> 01:33:11.398
When I got to Georgetown,

01:33:11.586 --> 01:33:14.005
I thought I'd fiinally be
among people who were like me.

01:33:14.195 --> 01:33:16.447
You know, smarter,
more ambitious people.

01:33:16.588 --> 01:33:19.216
I was sure that fiinally
I'd make some true friends.

01:33:20.807 --> 01:33:22.559
Excuse me!

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:24.722
Would you please be quiet?!

01:33:24.895 --> 01:33:26.939
It wasn't like that at all.

01:33:27.114 --> 01:33:28.865
A lot of them were just
spoiled little rich kids

01:33:29.028 --> 01:33:31.530
who didn't know
how lucky they had it.

01:33:31.725 --> 01:33:34.895
That's OK. I've come to
accept that very few people

01:33:35.117 --> 01:33:36.785
are truly destined to be special,

01:33:36.944 --> 01:33:38.654
and we're solo fliers.

01:33:38.770 --> 01:33:40.939
I guess it really is
like Dave said,

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:44.164
"If you're gonna be great,
you've got to be lonely."

01:33:48.818 --> 01:33:52.906
What happens to a man
when he loses everything?

01:33:53.123 --> 01:33:55.375
Everything he's worked for.

01:33:55.559 --> 01:33:59.521
Everything he believes in.

01:33:59.779 --> 01:34:01.906
Driven from his home,

01:34:02.084 --> 01:34:04.378
cast out of society,

01:34:04.564 --> 01:34:06.482
how can he survive?

01:34:06.651 --> 01:34:08.027
Where can he go?

01:34:08.172 --> 01:34:11.050
Right this way.

01:34:11.262 --> 01:34:12.847
New York City.

01:34:22.265 --> 01:34:25.226
For centuries, people
have come to New York

01:34:25.441 --> 01:34:28.777
seeking refuge from
their troubled lives.

01:34:29.008 --> 01:34:32.511
Now I am one of them.

01:34:32.705 --> 01:34:34.623
Besides, I'd always dreamed
of living in New York.

01:34:34.749 --> 01:34:36.793
All that excitement and culture.

01:34:36.967 --> 01:34:39.720
Living in the city brings
surprises all the time.

01:34:39.882 --> 01:34:42.551
Once in a while, I even bump
into former students of mine

01:34:42.708 --> 01:34:44.668
from Carver.

01:34:44.839 --> 01:34:47.300
Oh, sure, my apartment's
a little smaller

01:34:47.493 --> 01:34:49.078
than what I was used to
back in Omaha,

01:34:49.233 --> 01:34:51.026
and the rent's pretty darn steep,

01:34:51.190 --> 01:34:52.691
but it's got a lot of character.

01:34:52.843 --> 01:34:54.595
And I'm cozy enough.

01:34:57.758 --> 01:34:59.760
Besides, it's great
not needing a car.

01:34:59.890 --> 01:35:02.809
And I get a lot of reading
done on the subway.

01:35:03.021 --> 01:35:05.106
Some days I even walk to work.

01:35:07.501 --> 01:35:10.337
The job market is
pretty tight in New York,

01:35:10.545 --> 01:35:12.756
but after hunting around
for a while,

01:35:12.893 --> 01:35:15.271
I fiinally landed a position
in the education department

01:35:15.416 --> 01:35:17.544
at the Museum of Natural History.

01:35:17.722 --> 01:35:20.600
That's right.
I'm teaching again.

01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:24.105
When a school brings
its students to the museum

01:35:24.334 --> 01:35:25.293
on a fiield trip,

01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:27.297
there's a staffof
both volunteer docents

01:35:27.465 --> 01:35:29.342
and trained educators like myself...

01:35:29.465 --> 01:35:32.677
who pick up where
the classwork leaves off.

01:35:32.859 --> 01:35:34.986
And I've started
seeing someone new.

01:35:35.163 --> 01:35:37.082
Her name is Jillian.

01:35:37.251 --> 01:35:39.920
She works at the museum, too,
in Signs and Signage.

01:35:40.078 --> 01:35:42.706
She's really different
from Diane, and, I don't know,

01:35:42.906 --> 01:35:45.158
I've never met anyone
quite like her.

01:35:45.342 --> 01:35:47.969
She just got out of
a long relationship, too,

01:35:48.169 --> 01:35:49.796
so we're trying
to take it slow.

01:35:53.823 --> 01:35:56.284
You might ask if I ever
saw Tracy Flick again.

01:35:56.432 --> 01:35:58.143
Well, I did.

01:35:58.259 --> 01:36:00.220
Just once.

01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:05.353
I was down in Washington for
a museum educator's conference,

01:36:05.654 --> 01:36:07.906
and I stayed an extra day
to do some sightseeing.

01:36:10.656 --> 01:36:13.617
After an inspiring morning
on the Mall,

01:36:13.788 --> 01:36:17.458
I was on my way to
the Holocaust Museum when...

01:36:52.411 --> 01:36:54.538
I'll never know ifshe saw me.

01:36:54.673 --> 01:36:56.216
Probably not.

01:36:56.370 --> 01:36:58.747
But in that moment,
all the bad memories,

01:36:58.935 --> 01:37:01.813
all the things I'd ever
wanted to say to her,

01:37:02.024 --> 01:37:04.193
it all came flooding back.

01:37:07.025 --> 01:37:09.069
My fiirst impulse
was to run over there,

01:37:09.243 --> 01:37:10.453
pound on her window,

01:37:10.549 --> 01:37:12.842
and demand that she admit
she tore down those posters

01:37:13.027 --> 01:37:16.197
and lied and cheated her way
into winning that election.

01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:21.342
But, instead,
I just stood there.

01:37:21.639 --> 01:37:26.060
And I suddenly realized
I wasn't angry at her anymore.

01:37:26.337 --> 01:37:29.048
I just felt sorry for her.

01:37:29.251 --> 01:37:31.295
I mean, when I think
about my new life

01:37:31.469 --> 01:37:33.722
and all the exciting
things I'm doing,

01:37:33.906 --> 01:37:36.617
and then I think about
what her life must be like...

01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:39.323
probably still getting up
at 5:00 in the morning

01:37:39.515 --> 01:37:41.768
to pursue her pathetic
little dreams...

01:37:41.952 --> 01:37:44.454
it just makes me sad.

01:37:44.649 --> 01:37:47.986
I mean where is she really
trying to get to anyway?

01:37:48.216 --> 01:37:50.844
What is she doing in that limo?

01:37:51.042 --> 01:37:54.212
Who the fuck does
she think she is?!

01:38:03.134 --> 01:38:06.346
Hey, you! Hey!

01:38:06.570 --> 01:38:08.614
You asshole!

01:38:08.745 --> 01:38:10.998
But that's all
ancient history now.

01:38:11.181 --> 01:38:13.558
I've got a whole new life.

01:38:13.704 --> 01:38:15.998
I mean, that's what's
great about America.

01:38:16.182 --> 01:38:17.517
You can always start over.

01:38:17.619 --> 01:38:19.788
So would that make this
an igneous rock

01:38:19.923 --> 01:38:22.092
or a sedimentary rock?

01:38:22.272 --> 01:38:23.982
What's the difference
between igneous

01:38:24.099 --> 01:38:25.517
and sedimentary anyway?

01:38:35.799 --> 01:38:38.218
Anybody?

01:38:41.367 --> 01:38:44.036
I want to know
how love began

01:38:44.236 --> 01:38:47.031
I want to go
to school again

01:38:47.239 --> 01:38:50.367
If you'll be

01:38:50.588 --> 01:38:53.466
The teacher

01:38:53.676 --> 01:38:56.554
Long before
the school bells chime

01:38:56.763 --> 01:39:00.267
I'll be there
ahead oftime

01:39:00.504 --> 01:39:05.092
Just to see my teacher

01:39:05.333 --> 01:39:08.544
Start right
from the fiirst of it

01:39:08.724 --> 01:39:10.643
Don't miss a thing

01:39:10.769 --> 01:39:11.937
I want to get

01:39:12.074 --> 01:39:16.787
All the facts, then
I'll know what to do

01:39:17.032 --> 01:39:21.454
When we graduate,
I'll hold you tight

01:39:21.686 --> 01:39:23.897
Then you'll know
you taught me right

01:39:24.035 --> 01:39:28.664
Teacher, teacher,
I'm in love with you

01:39:36.301 --> 01:39:38.804
If you'll be

01:39:38.997 --> 01:39:41.750
The teacher

01:39:47.392 --> 01:39:51.187
If you'll be

01:39:51.393 --> 01:39:53.854
The teacher

01:39:54.047 --> 01:39:57.426
Start right
from the first of it

01:39:57.613 --> 01:39:59.073
Don't miss a thing

01:39:59.223 --> 01:40:00.390
I want to get

01:40:00.528 --> 01:40:05.366
All the facts, then
I'll know what to do

01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:10.165
When we graduate,
I'll hold you tight

01:40:10.401 --> 01:40:12.486
Then you'll know
you taught me right

01:40:12.663 --> 01:40:14.206
Teacher, teacher

01:40:14.359 --> 01:40:17.028
I'm in love with you
