00:02.600 --> 00:03.624
(people laughing)

00:03.670 --> 00:05.661
*

00:08.770 --> 00:10.260
Hi.

00:10.310 --> 00:13.802
My name is Therese Dodd
and these are my breasts.

00:13.840 --> 00:15.137
(audience laughs)

00:15.180 --> 00:18.047
_ Breast cancer
IS a serious matter.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.275
Early detection
can save lives.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.412
And so,

00:21.450 --> 00:23.338
as a public service,

00:23.390 --> 00:28.054
I will now demonstrate
a self-exam.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.481
(drummer plays vampy beat)

00:30.530 --> 00:32.122
(audience oohs, whistling)
Hey.

00:32.160 --> 00:33.252
Hey.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.551
This is serious.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.568
You do have a_bra on
under that, right?

00:36.600 --> 00:37.760
No, Joey,
what I have

00:37.800 --> 00:39.688
is a drive to help women.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.334
Yeah, see, we're live,
so it's probably best...

00:42.370 --> 00:44.133
Okay, there they are.

00:44.170 --> 00:46.138
MAN:
And did you hear
the host say that?

00:46.180 --> 00:48.136
Say we were live?

00:48.180 --> 00:49.374
Yeah.

00:49.410 --> 00:53.619
But I thought it was like a
seven-second delay or something.

00:53.650 --> 00:55.618
Did you just smile
at your lavwer

00:55.650 --> 00:57.242
because he coached you
to say that?

00:57.290 --> 00:58.848
Objection.
No,

00:58.890 --> 01:01.450
I smiled at my lawyer
because he's cute.

01:01.490 --> 01:03.378
You're being sued
for $2 million, Ms. Dodd.

01:03.430 --> 01:05.785
I would take this more seriously
if I were you.

01:07.530 --> 01:09.521
(audience oohing)

01:09.570 --> 01:12.539
The first step
to a self-exam is...

01:12.570 --> 01:14.765
(audience laughing)
Hey, hey.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.631
Stop looking over there.
I am right here.

01:16.670 --> 01:18.706
Cover that up.
We're...

01:18.740 --> 01:21.504
The first thing you want to do
with your (bleep)

01:21.540 --> 01:23.747
Okay!
is touch and massage them

01:23.780 --> 01:25.338
like so.

01:25.380 --> 01:28.372
We have placed censor boxes
over the offending areas,

01:28.420 --> 01:31.412
but on that day,
your routine was sent out

01:31.450 --> 01:32.553
to eight million households.

01:32.590 --> 01:34.649
But you didn't care,
did you, Ms. Dodd?

01:34.690 --> 01:38.126
Well, I cared about women being
informed about breast cancer.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.128
ATTORNEY:
Oh, Ms. Dodd, really.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.798
That's why you disrobed?
Sure.

01:41.830 --> 01:43.525
My mom died of breast cancer
last year.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.390
(car horn honks in distance)
Why else?

01:45.430 --> 01:47.136
Because you happened to have
a humorous book coming out

01:47.170 --> 01:48.262
in two months.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.268
And you didn't care
that you were using

01:50.310 --> 01:52.801
vulgar language in front
of eight million viewers?

01:52.840 --> 01:54.705
What do you mean, "vulgar"?

01:54.740 --> 01:55.877
Which word?

01:55.910 --> 01:57.798
I think you know, ma'am.
No, I don't.

01:57.850 --> 01:59.818
Honestly, which one?

01:59.850 --> 02:02.683
It rhymes with "bits."

02:02.720 --> 02:05.143
DODD:
It rhymes with "bits"?

02:05.190 --> 02:06.680
(horn honks)
Are we eight years old?

02:06.720 --> 02:09.621
You mean (horn honks).

02:09.660 --> 02:10.854
Bob, would you close
that, please?

02:10.890 --> 02:14.291
(horns honking)
You enjoy using
vulgar language to provoke,

02:14.330 --> 02:15.058
don't you, Ms. Dodd?
I do.

02:15.100 --> 02:17.694
No further questions,
Your Honor.

02:18.830 --> 02:21.628
Therese, did you go on the show

02:21.670 --> 02:23.831
intending to take off
your blouse?
No.

02:23.870 --> 02:25.565
And did you feel
that the show pushed you

02:25.610 --> 02:27.202
to do something
outrageous?

02:27.240 --> 02:30.573
Oh, yeah, they always have me
on to push the envelope.

02:30.610 --> 02:31.907
And you were told that the
talk show would be delayed

02:31.950 --> 02:33.440
due to a football overrun?

02:33.480 --> 02:35.539
Yes.
And therefore,

02:35.580 --> 02:36.945
you thought that the show
would be broadcast

02:36.990 --> 02:38.480
during the safe harbor period?

02:38.520 --> 02:40.317
Uh... what?

02:40.360 --> 02:42.624
Safe harbor.
It's the time after 10:00 p.m.

02:42.660 --> 02:44.252
and before 6:00 am.

02:44.290 --> 02:47.418
when network programs can,
according to

02:47.460 --> 02:51.260
FCC rules, show nudity
and use language

02:51.300 --> 02:54.599
like (horns honking).

02:54.640 --> 02:57.359
JUDGE:
Bob, how are we getting on
with that window?

02:57.410 --> 02:58.866
DODD:
Yes, Counselor,

02:58.910 --> 03:01.572
I thought the show was
going on at 10:00 p.m.

03:01.610 --> 03:02.747
And therefore,
the words you used,

03:02.780 --> 03:05.340
and the skin you exposed,

03:05.380 --> 03:07.314
was problematic only due
to the network's

03:07.350 --> 03:08.942
self-imposed censorship?

03:08.980 --> 03:09.685
Your Honor, it
doesn't matter.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.608
The show was
taped in Chicago,

03:11.650 --> 03:13.356
but broadcast live on the
West Coast at 8:00 p.m.

03:13.390 --> 03:15.210
Yes, but that wasn't
Therese's decision.

03:15.260 --> 03:16.329
That was the network's.

03:16.360 --> 03:19.295
She thought the show was safely
in the safe harbor.

03:19.330 --> 03:20.752
Ms. Dodd signed a contract with
the network, not with the FCC.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.290
DODD:
Let me get this straight.

03:22.330 --> 03:24.298
The FCC says I can
strip down naked

03:24.330 --> 03:26.264
and talk dirty
like a cable show,

03:26.300 --> 03:28.632
but the network says I can't?

03:28.670 --> 03:30.308
Ms. Dodd, please let your
attorney ask the questions.

03:30.340 --> 03:31.432
I'm just surprised,

03:31.470 --> 03:32.801
aren't you?

03:32.840 --> 03:35.968
The network can show
the same stuff as cable,

03:36.010 --> 03:37.978
but they choose not to?

03:38.010 --> 03:39.375
WILL:
Your Honor,
this lawsuit is a sham.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.569
Mr. Preston and his client,

03:40.620 --> 03:42.918
the network, know they can't
get $2 million from my client.

03:42.950 --> 03:45.339
They are suing her
for the same reason

03:45.390 --> 03:48.382
their Standards and Practices
are stricter than the FCC.

03:48.420 --> 03:49.819
For their advertisers.

03:49.860 --> 03:51.521
Mr. Gardner makes a sound point,
Mr. Preston.

03:51.560 --> 03:55.519
Ms. Dodd shouldn't be liable
for the network's choices.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.267
There's only one question
remaining for me

03:58.300 --> 03:59.494
and that's premeditation.

03:59.540 --> 04:02.668
Unless you have evidence to
prove Ms. Dodd went on the show

04:02.710 --> 04:05.565
intending to perform
indecent material--

04:05.610 --> 04:09.273
for instance, an earlier
and identical stand-up routine--

04:09.310 --> 04:11.699
then I am prone to dismiss.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.308
(window slams shut)

04:14.550 --> 04:16.017
I don't understand breasts.

04:16.050 --> 04:17.847
(audience laughing)
They're made of fat;

04:17.890 --> 04:20.984
they sag; they drool;
and guys still go for them.

04:21.020 --> 04:24.387
It's like being turned on
by Jabba the Hutt.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.694
I've decided to name mine.

04:26.730 --> 04:27.822
This one's Margie.

04:27.860 --> 04:29.464
(audience laughing)

04:29.500 --> 04:31.593
Margie's the misunderstood
one...

04:31.630 --> 04:33.666
Anything yet?
No.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.531
Another breast routine.

04:35.570 --> 04:36.832
But different material.

04:37.870 --> 04:39.428
Do you think she's funny?

04:39.480 --> 04:41.334
Sometimes. You?

04:41.380 --> 04:43.803
It seems like an easy laugh--
breasts.

04:43.850 --> 04:46.717
Well, guys make penis jokes.

04:46.750 --> 04:47.978
(chuckles)
Yeah.

04:48.020 --> 04:49.715
Yeah, those are easy, too.

04:49.750 --> 04:52.719
You've, um, been spending
a lot of time with Clarke.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.852
Yeah.

04:53.890 --> 04:55.414
Everything okay?

04:55.460 --> 04:57.087
Yeah.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.950
He just...
he just likes to talk.

04:58.990 --> 05:00.628
Laura?

05:00.660 --> 05:01.922
Oh, hello, Alicia.

05:01.960 --> 05:03.496
How are you?
Good.

05:03.530 --> 05:04.929
You're out of uniform,
Captain.

05:04.970 --> 05:06.062
Permanently.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.397
Unfortunately.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.395
What? Why?

05:08.440 --> 05:09.429
My choice.

05:09.470 --> 05:10.539
I was losing my bearings,

05:10.570 --> 05:11.707
things soured.

05:11.740 --> 05:13.628
I'm on the market now.

05:13.680 --> 05:14.704
Whee...

05:14.740 --> 05:16.571
You're... looking for a job?

05:16.610 --> 05:17.770
Yeah.

05:17.810 --> 05:19.004
No, not here.

05:19.050 --> 05:20.472
I'm out there checking
out the job market.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.681
This is my interview outfit.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.608
So you're here...?

05:24.650 --> 05:26.083
Oh, my bill.
I haven't paid it yet.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.417
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.552
What? Why?

05:28.590 --> 05:29.682
We lost.

05:29.730 --> 05:30.822
But we did our best.

05:30.860 --> 05:31.929
Don't worry.

05:31.960 --> 05:35.088
So can you show me
to Clarke Hayden?

05:35.130 --> 05:36.768
Um, that door.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.722
And, Laura, if you
need anything--

05:38.770 --> 05:39.964
I started over pretty late.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.536
So, if you want to talk.

05:41.570 --> 05:43.003
I'll call you.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.598
(phone ringing)

05:47.440 --> 05:48.509
(sighs)

05:48.540 --> 05:49.575
Hello?

05:49.610 --> 05:50.702
MAN:
Hello.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.570
What do you think
of Brazilian food?

05:52.620 --> 05:54.645
What do I... What?

05:54.680 --> 05:56.511
(line clicks)

05:56.550 --> 05:58.415
ELI:
Yes, Gus,
we take Maddie Hayward

05:58.450 --> 06:00.054
very seriously as a contender.

06:00.090 --> 06:02.650
But our eye is still on
the Republican, Kresteva.

06:02.690 --> 06:04.385
(reporters talking over each
other over speakerphone)

06:04.430 --> 06:05.658
MAN: _
One question.

06:05.690 --> 06:06.896
FEMALE REPORTER:
Maddie's worth $180 million--

06:06.930 --> 06:08.750
that's a lot of ad buys.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.427
You're telling me
you're not worried?

06:10.470 --> 06:11.789
I'm telling you,
these millionaires always

06:11.830 --> 06:13.798
burn themselves out
after a while

06:13.840 --> 06:15.660
because money only gets you
so far.

06:15.700 --> 06:18.533
Now does anyone have
a question about,

06:18.570 --> 06:21.004
you know, the issues?

06:21.040 --> 06:22.803
(reporters talking at once)
MALE REPORTER: Wait, Eli, Eli.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.806
What about Peter sleeping
with a campaign worker?

06:24.850 --> 06:26.738
Is that you, Mitch?

06:26.780 --> 06:28.077
This is crap and you know it.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.678
Synth printed it, Eli.

06:29.720 --> 06:32.086
A disgraced reporter printed it.

06:32.120 --> 06:35.112
Peter Florrick has categorically
denied these charges,

06:35.160 --> 06:37.628
and the accuser has been proved
a liar.

06:37.660 --> 06:39.548
Now, are there
any real questions?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.818
MALE REPORTER 2:
Sure. One.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.498
Okay. Who's this?

06:43.530 --> 06:46.693
Wexler Turner from NSW News.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.197
Uh... okay, go for it.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.208
Can you respond to reports
that this campaign worker

06:51.240 --> 06:52.776
has identified
a distinguishing mark

06:52.810 --> 06:54.801
on Peter Florrick's anatomy?

06:54.840 --> 06:56.944
(wry laugh)

06:56.980 --> 06:58.106
You're kidding.

06:58.150 --> 06:59.572
No, sir.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.019
She says he has a birthmark
on his penis,

07:01.050 --> 07:03.484
shaped like Brazil.

07:03.520 --> 07:06.011
Can you confirm or deny that
Florrick has such a birthmark?

07:10.160 --> 07:12.151
This is...

07:15.130 --> 07:17.598
How dare you, sir?

07:17.630 --> 07:19.097
MITCH:
"At long last, how dare you"?

07:19.130 --> 07:21.064
(reporters laughing)

07:21.100 --> 07:24.501
This is an outrage.

07:24.540 --> 07:26.906
Do you guys listen to yourselves
anymore?

07:26.940 --> 07:28.669
Okay, that's the Morning Call
for today.

07:28.710 --> 07:30.200
(beeps)

07:30.250 --> 07:31.899
Get the candidate
on the phone.

07:31.950 --> 07:33.679
Where is he?

07:33.720 --> 07:35.073
And someone call Alicia.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.940
WOMAN :
Rebecca Stokes.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.787
I'm a makeup artist
with ten years' experience.

07:38.820 --> 07:40.481
PRESTON:
And did you do the makeup

07:40.520 --> 07:41.953
for the defendant
on the night in question?

07:41.990 --> 07:43.252
Yes. Hi, Therese.

07:43.290 --> 07:44.826
And when you do the makeup
for guests...

07:44.860 --> 07:46.088
Strike that.

07:46.130 --> 07:48.052
Was there anything
unusual you did

07:48.100 --> 07:50.625
with Ms. Dodd's makeup?
Yeah.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.023
Uh, no.

07:52.070 --> 07:56.507
I mean,
just, um, foundation and blush.

07:56.540 --> 07:57.802
What do you mean?

07:57.840 --> 08:00.604
Was there anything unusual
regarding the placement?

08:00.640 --> 08:01.971
The placement?

08:02.010 --> 08:03.238
I, uh...

08:03.280 --> 08:06.579
You usually only do makeup
on the face?

08:06.620 --> 08:08.042
Oh, yeah,
and sometimes the arms.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.638
And what did Ms. Dodd
ask you to do?

08:09.690 --> 08:10.884
Oh, I see.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.512
She wanted makeup on her chest.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.983
And by her chest,
you don't mean

08:15.020 --> 08:17.159
just the cleavage?

08:17.190 --> 08:17.929
I do.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.222
No, uh,

08:19.260 --> 08:20.557
but you mean more than that?

08:20.600 --> 08:21.851
Oh, yeah.

08:21.900 --> 08:24.164
She wanted
both her breasts done.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.532
I thought it was
unusual because,

08:26.570 --> 08:27.798
you know, the camera is only
gonna see the cleavage,

08:27.840 --> 08:30.161
but then it made sense

08:30.210 --> 08:31.837
after I saw.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.079
Okay.

08:35.110 --> 08:36.202
What do you want?

08:36.240 --> 08:38.049
$2 million.
Mr. Preston,

08:38.080 --> 08:40.219
our client can't pay
a tenth of that.

08:40.250 --> 08:41.547
She can when her book comes out.

08:41.580 --> 08:43.047
(door opens)

08:43.090 --> 08:46.685
WILL:
And how will that look
for your network,

08:46.720 --> 08:49.553
bankrupting a comedian whose
mother died of breast cancer?

08:49.590 --> 08:51.820
It'll look like we take decency
on our airwaves seriously.

08:51.860 --> 08:52.952
Then have our client apologize.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.820
Have her do a PSA
for you.

08:54.860 --> 08:56.566
No. Thank you, though.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.091
(Clarke clears throat)

08:59.130 --> 09:00.893
Yes, Mr. Hayden.

09:00.940 --> 09:03.602
Nothing.
Just clearing my throat.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.631
Then we have nothing
to negotiate.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.307
We'll see you in court.

09:08.340 --> 09:11.275
(sighs)

09:12.280 --> 09:15.249
Parents Against
Indecency

09:15.280 --> 09:17.987
have bombarded the FCC
with letters and complaints

09:18.020 --> 09:20.318
regarding Ms. Dodd's
little stunt.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.578
(phone buzzing)
And our expectation is the FCC

09:22.630 --> 09:24.985
will fine us the maximum:

09:25.030 --> 09:26.725
$3 million.
Mr. Preston,

09:26.760 --> 09:27.988
we've already made clear
our client can't...

09:28.030 --> 09:29.895
Over the next
two days,

09:29.930 --> 09:30.999
I'm meeting individually

09:31.030 --> 09:33.863
with three of the FCC
commissioners to lobby them.

09:33.900 --> 09:36.095
The three swing votes.

09:36.140 --> 09:40.179
There is one thing your client
can do to quash our suit.

09:40.210 --> 09:42.644
Apologize.

09:44.080 --> 09:47.675
Tell them the saintly story
of her mom dying of cancer,

09:47.720 --> 09:49.039
and her sense of overexuberance

09:49.080 --> 09:51.344
at wanting to do something
about it.

09:51.390 --> 09:53.017
You'll quash the suit
if she does?

09:53.060 --> 09:54.880
No, I'll quash the suit
if she's successful.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.184
She needs to convince two
of the three swing votes

09:57.230 --> 09:59.824
for the FCC to
drop their fine.

09:59.860 --> 10:02.294
She does that,
she doesn't pay a cent.

10:02.330 --> 10:03.661
We have no choice.

10:03.700 --> 10:05.019
I know.
That's not the concern.

10:05.070 --> 10:06.367
The concern is her.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.799
She won't go?

10:07.840 --> 10:09.068
No, she will.

10:09.100 --> 10:10.806
She just... (sighs)

10:10.840 --> 10:12.774
She needs a babysitter.

10:13.810 --> 10:16.176
Alicia,
you go with her to DC.

10:16.210 --> 10:17.245
Make sure she stays in line.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.349
DIANE:
Uh, Cary will go with you.

10:18.380 --> 10:19.369
I don't think we need two.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.116
I can stay.

10:21.150 --> 10:22.686
Do you mind giving us a minute?

10:22.720 --> 10:24.711
Sure.

10:26.350 --> 10:28.352
You don't think
Alicia can do it?

10:28.390 --> 10:31.188
No, I think we need
to use Cary more.

10:31.230 --> 10:33.323
He's taking a backseat
on too many cases.

10:33.360 --> 10:34.793
He complained?

10:34.830 --> 10:36.058
No, he didn't have to.
I noticed.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.795
You think I'm holding him back?

10:37.830 --> 10:39.969
I think you're the head
of litigation,

10:40.000 --> 10:41.331
and we need to use Cary more.

10:41.370 --> 10:43.338
That's all.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.678
What's going on there?

10:48.710 --> 10:49.938
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Hayden.

10:49.980 --> 10:51.072
And you.

10:51.110 --> 10:54.079
Lockhart/Gardner
is a good firm.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.270
It has the feel of a
family-run business,

10:56.320 --> 10:59.084
but the client base of
a Portman & Michaels.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.213
I don't think I...

11:01.260 --> 11:04.388
You know we're on opposite
sides of this suit?

11:04.430 --> 11:06.455
I also know you're
looking to expand

11:06.490 --> 11:08.094
from LA. to the Midwest.

11:10.800 --> 11:14.065
We're looking to build,
not purchase.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.091
Yes, but isn't it easier
to remodel an existing home

11:16.140 --> 11:17.300
than to build a new one?

11:17.340 --> 11:19.331
Not if the foundation
IS compromised.

11:19.370 --> 11:21.702
Well, why don't you
test the foundation

11:21.740 --> 11:23.742
to see if it's compromised?

11:26.480 --> 11:29.745
PRESTON: Does the firm
want to be acquired?

11:29.790 --> 11:31.189
CLARKE:
It's not up to the firm.

11:31.220 --> 11:33.256
It's up to the courts.

11:33.290 --> 11:35.155
With my input.

11:37.290 --> 11:39.895
Then I'll consider it.

11:55.140 --> 11:57.108
You want to know what?

11:57.150 --> 11:58.344
We don't want
to know anything.

11:58.380 --> 11:59.813
I do.

11:59.850 --> 12:01.317
How is it even possible

12:01.350 --> 12:03.386
to have a birthmark
shaped like Brazil?

12:03.420 --> 12:04.842
So, you don't?

12:04.890 --> 12:06.084
No, Jim.

12:06.120 --> 12:07.212
I don't.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.386
Would you like to check?

12:08.420 --> 12:09.751
ELI: Okay, here's
the problem.

12:09.790 --> 12:11.348
We buried the
affair story,

12:11.390 --> 12:12.994
but this is different.

12:13.030 --> 12:14.497
This is late-night fodder.

12:14.530 --> 12:16.498
It's also the perfect
political trap.

12:16.530 --> 12:19.465
We can't have the candidate
say that he doesn't have

12:19.500 --> 12:21.434
a Brazil-shaped birthmark
on his penis.

12:21.470 --> 12:23.961
We can't have surrogates say it
because how did they see?

12:24.010 --> 12:25.500
We could have the wife.

12:25.540 --> 12:26.837
No. No.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.006
Then we change the subject.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.439
Boy.

12:29.480 --> 12:32.369
You ever wonder
about this country?

12:32.410 --> 12:34.139
All the time.

12:34.180 --> 12:36.273
Well, here's the real worry.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.209
If this is the perfect
political trap,

12:39.250 --> 12:42.879
I don't think Indira Starr
was smart enough to think it up.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.921
Kresteva?

12:44.960 --> 12:46.052
Sounds like him.

12:46.090 --> 12:50.060
I think our Republican opponent
is up to his old tricks.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.163
I'm on it.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.565
(door closes)

12:54.600 --> 12:56.033
What do you have?

12:56.070 --> 12:57.298
To change the subject?

12:57.340 --> 12:59.001
Mm-hmm.
A rumor.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.304
Maddie Hayward, your
primary opponent--

13:01.340 --> 13:03.444
she's sleeping
with her aide.

13:03.480 --> 13:04.947
Mmm, not big enough.

13:04.980 --> 13:06.208
She's single.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.478
The aide is a girl.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.314
Okay.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.851
Our fingerprints
cannot be on this.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.126
And get some photos if you can.

13:26.170 --> 13:29.059
DODD: So, I have to tell
three FCC commissioners

13:29.100 --> 13:30.965
about my mom
dying of cancer?

13:31.010 --> 13:32.466
I believe in you.

13:32.510 --> 13:34.831
(chuckles)

13:34.880 --> 13:36.575
Do you like Coldplay?

13:36.610 --> 13:37.941
Do I like them?

13:37.980 --> 13:39.140
Enough.

13:39.180 --> 13:40.875
I hate them.
Okay.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.239
When I get
to the part

13:42.280 --> 13:44.145
about my mom's
hair falling out,

13:44.190 --> 13:45.543
I want you to
hum "Fix You."

13:45.590 --> 13:46.887
(laughs)

13:46.920 --> 13:48.057
PRESTON:
She only needs

13:48.090 --> 13:49.352
two of the three
swmg votes.

13:49.390 --> 13:50.880
Can she do it?

13:50.930 --> 13:52.283
She's motivated.

13:52.330 --> 13:53.524
PRESTON:
Good.

13:55.560 --> 13:59.223
It must be difficult,
this bankruptcy.

13:59.270 --> 14:00.862
Not really.

14:00.900 --> 14:03.960
But you've lost 40%
of your attorneys?

14:04.010 --> 14:06.308
We still have
our major clients.

14:06.340 --> 14:07.978
Even family law?

14:08.010 --> 14:10.171
They have their
major clients?

14:10.210 --> 14:11.643
Yes. Why?

14:11.680 --> 14:14.843
Rank, unfettered curiosity.

14:15.950 --> 14:18.089
MAN:
You don't have to tell me.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.348
I'm on your side.

14:19.390 --> 14:21.483
Wow. That was easy.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.624
They made me think I had
to take you in the next room

14:23.660 --> 14:25.252
and give you a...
PRESTON:
So, we can depend

14:25.290 --> 14:26.552
on your vote, sir?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.656
Certainly.

14:29.700 --> 14:32.168
But I've always thought
you network folk

14:32.200 --> 14:34.964
were too terrified
of us at the FCC anyway.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.537
_ We're not the ones
InfantIIIZIng entertainment.

14:37.570 --> 14:39.367
That's what I told him.
GILL:
So hypocritical.

14:39.410 --> 14:41.002
You allow yourselves
to show naked bodies

14:41.040 --> 14:43.679
just as long as they're bruised
and covered in blood.

14:43.710 --> 14:45.075
Yeah.
Why is that, Burl?

14:45.110 --> 14:46.646
PRESTON: We're not
talking about...
Tell us.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.545
Okay. Thank you so much,
Commissioner Gill.

14:48.580 --> 14:51.287
I haven't talked
about my mom dying yet.

14:51.320 --> 14:52.685
That's okay, Therese.

14:52.720 --> 14:56.156
Okay. Thank you.

14:56.190 --> 14:57.521
Nice paperweight.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.448
First effort in metal shop
or something?

15:00.530 --> 15:02.259
That's from 9/11.

15:02.300 --> 15:03.528
DODD:
Oh.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.459
Damn those terrorists
and their paperweights.

15:09.640 --> 15:11.437
(sighs)
I know, I know.

15:11.470 --> 15:12.664
Comedy killer.

15:12.710 --> 15:14.439
Do you think
we'll be all right?

15:14.480 --> 15:18.701
He's on board, but we can't be
going off script like that.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.945
MAN:
Cary?

15:23.390 --> 15:24.641
Sir.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.442
I didn't know you were in town.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.412
Work. The FCC.
Ah.

15:28.460 --> 15:31.054
But you're still with, um...?

15:31.090 --> 15:33.229
Lockhart/Gardner, yeah.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.122
Uh, excuse me.

15:36.160 --> 15:38.060
This is my colleague,
Alicia Florrick.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.590
My father, Jeffrey Agos.

15:39.630 --> 15:41.063
Really?

15:41.100 --> 15:43.307
What a pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Agos.
And you.

15:43.340 --> 15:44.409
How's Mom?

15:44.440 --> 15:45.509
Good.

15:45.540 --> 15:46.529
Last I heard.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.276
Martha?
Uh, overseas
in China.

15:48.310 --> 15:49.538
Back in a month.

15:49.580 --> 15:52.469
And how's, uh,
that girl of yours?

15:52.510 --> 15:54.546
That girl? Which one?

15:54.580 --> 15:55.979
The last one.

15:56.020 --> 15:57.248
The pretty one.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.518
You mean from law school?
Yes.

15:58.550 --> 16:00.654
I haven't seen her
in five years, Dad.
Ah.

16:00.690 --> 16:03.022
It was a pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Agos.

16:03.060 --> 16:05.051
Cary is quite the lawyer.

16:05.090 --> 16:07.126
So, who are you here to see?

16:07.160 --> 16:09.128
Commissioner Bix today.

16:09.160 --> 16:10.764
Martinez tomorrow.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.633
Ah. You want me to put
in a good word for you?

16:13.670 --> 16:15.194
Had lunch with them both.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.333
No, we're fine.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.698
How long you been doing this?

16:24.750 --> 16:26.775
Watching Maddie's house?

16:26.810 --> 16:28.539
No. This.

16:28.580 --> 16:30.138
The business.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.418
A while.

16:31.450 --> 16:32.712
Me, too.

16:35.290 --> 16:36.587
That her?

16:36.620 --> 16:38.520
The aide?
(camera shutter clicking)

16:38.560 --> 16:39.788
No.

16:39.830 --> 16:41.650
Who is it?

16:44.400 --> 16:46.527
Indira Starr.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.595
She's meeting
with Maddie Hayward?

16:48.640 --> 16:50.130
That explains
who's behind

16:50.170 --> 16:52.138
the birthmark rumor.

16:52.170 --> 16:53.671
PRESTON:
First of all,

16:53.710 --> 16:55.268
no 9/11 jokes.

16:55.310 --> 16:56.709
Are we agreed?

16:56.740 --> 16:58.776
Oh, no.

16:58.810 --> 17:01.472
I thought the commissioner
was just meeting with us.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.817
What?

17:02.850 --> 17:04.181
PRESTON:
Punch Sutton.

17:04.220 --> 17:05.585
The chair of
Parents Against Indecency.

17:05.620 --> 17:06.746
(cell phone buzzing)

17:06.790 --> 17:08.758
Hello.

17:08.790 --> 17:11.224
Oh, hi, Laura.
How are you?

17:11.260 --> 17:12.659
Good.
Really good, I think.

17:12.690 --> 17:14.829
Ijust... I need your help.

17:14.860 --> 17:17.693
Do you know Eddie Kolakowski
at Armstrong, Hayes & LeGarde?

17:17.730 --> 17:19.425
Uh, yes.
I mean, by name.

17:19.470 --> 17:22.189
Do you think you could call him
and say nice things about me?

17:22.240 --> 17:23.332
Certainly.

17:23.370 --> 17:24.234
So, the interview went well?

17:24.270 --> 17:25.828
I hate saying that
and jinxing things,

17:25.870 --> 17:27.599
but they said it's between me
and one other person.

17:27.640 --> 17:28.607
That's fantastic.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.176
In this economy?

17:30.210 --> 17:31.700
I know. It's really
a cattle call out here.

17:31.750 --> 17:32.705
Well, I will call.

17:32.750 --> 17:33.842
And congratulations.

17:33.880 --> 17:34.847
Don't say that yet.

17:34.880 --> 17:35.847
Take it back.

17:35.880 --> 17:39.589
We have over 3,000 complaints,
Commissioner,

17:39.620 --> 17:41.349
all regarding this
full frontal nudity.

17:41.390 --> 17:42.584
ALICIA:
Yes,

17:42.620 --> 17:44.679
but all those complaints
were organized

17:44.730 --> 17:46.721
by Parents Against
Indecency itself.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.796
We have children, just like you.

17:48.830 --> 17:52.425
We're worried about the
vulgarization of our culture.

17:52.470 --> 17:56.258
This isn't about one swear word
or a glimpse of a breast.

17:56.300 --> 17:57.506
This is about the floodgates...

17:57.540 --> 17:58.859
PRESTON:
But the floodgates
are open, sir.

17:58.910 --> 18:00.639
The screens have
multiplied--

18:00.680 --> 18:02.307
with iPads, iPods,
the Internet...

18:02.340 --> 18:03.648
PUNCH:
Then you should be happy.

18:03.680 --> 18:06.171
There are many avenues
for this type of content.

18:06.210 --> 18:09.270
But why is it wrong to insist
on one place where parents

18:09.320 --> 18:11.345
don't always have to
be on the defensive?

18:11.390 --> 18:13.255
Don't.
ALICIA: But you
allowed exactly

18:13.290 --> 18:15.110
this kind of nudity
and profanity

18:15.160 --> 18:16.616
on network TV, Commissioner.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.423
I did not.
Schindler's List

18:18.460 --> 18:20.792
had full frontal nudity
and was shown,

18:20.830 --> 18:22.752
without FCC objection,
at 9:00 p.m.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.689
Do you really want to suggest
Ms. Dodd's little striptease

18:25.730 --> 18:27.766
had the same merit
as Schindler's List?

18:27.800 --> 18:30.439
If you were a woman
with breast cancer, it did.

18:30.470 --> 18:32.404
PRESTON: It is our argument
that the Spielberg exception

18:32.440 --> 18:33.702
is unfair restraint.

18:33.740 --> 18:35.571
You can't make an allowance

18:35.610 --> 18:37.146
for one filmmaker
and not another.

18:37.180 --> 18:38.374
They don't make it
for a filmmaker;

18:38.410 --> 18:39.547
they make it for a
filmmaker's work.

18:39.580 --> 18:41.571
Ms. Dodd,
what are your thoughts?

18:41.620 --> 18:43.349
Oh. Well...

18:43.390 --> 18:46.609
I don't think I'm
any less decent than Spielberg.

18:46.650 --> 18:48.686
I mean, have you seen him eat?

18:48.720 --> 18:52.781
Maybe it would help if you
explain to Commissioner Bix

18:52.830 --> 18:55.492
your reasons
for your breast exam.

18:55.530 --> 18:57.498
DODD:
Yeah.

18:57.530 --> 18:59.828
Well, uh, my mom died.

18:59.870 --> 19:01.861
She was funny.

19:01.900 --> 19:05.165
And, uh, she got breast cancer.

19:07.310 --> 19:09.835
I remember the day she died.

19:09.880 --> 19:15.375
Uh, I think she
had gas or something

19:15.420 --> 19:19.641
because she just let out
the most massive...

19:20.960 --> 19:22.780
...passing of gas.

19:22.820 --> 19:24.583
And, uh, she kept

19:24.630 --> 19:26.188
cracking jokes
about it.

19:26.230 --> 19:28.949
Uh, and I just thought, wow.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.696
You know,
I couldn't believe it.

19:31.730 --> 19:36.599
So close to death
and still making jokes.

19:38.870 --> 19:40.872
I just can't do it.

19:40.910 --> 19:44.368
I know what you want--
me holding her hand

19:44.410 --> 19:47.243
and staring
into her deep, sad eyes--

19:47.280 --> 19:50.579
but... anything else.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.986
I'll kitsch up
anything you want,

19:53.020 --> 19:54.885
but just not this.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.854
Then get ready
to pay $2 million.

19:56.890 --> 19:59.324
No. Gill is
still with us,

19:59.360 --> 20:00.622
so I think
we're tied.

20:00.660 --> 20:02.218
We're not sure about Bix.

20:02.260 --> 20:04.569
It all comes down to tomorrow--
Commissmner Martinez.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.420
Okay, good.
Keep us in touch.

20:06.470 --> 20:08.461
Oh, and one other thing.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.331
This might not be
anything, but...

20:10.370 --> 20:12.600
Burl's been asking
about our firm.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.608
He... What do you mean?

20:14.640 --> 20:18.007
He asked about Chapter 11,
how it's going.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.847
What did you say?

20:19.880 --> 20:21.609
I said we were doing well.

20:21.650 --> 20:24.642
That_we had
our major clients.

20:25.650 --> 20:27.515
Was that the wrong thing to say?

20:27.560 --> 20:29.448
I don't know.
Was there anything else?

20:29.490 --> 20:31.629
He asked about family law,
how it was doing.

20:31.660 --> 20:33.355
Uh, one second, Alicia.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.495
He's after us.

20:36.530 --> 20:38.464
That's what the meeting
with Clarke was yesterday.

20:41.070 --> 20:42.890
Alicia, if you get a chance,

20:42.940 --> 20:45.408
tell him we lost _
our top client, Edelstein.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.977
You want me to emphasize
we're not doing well?

20:48.010 --> 20:49.705
Yes, please.

20:49.740 --> 20:52.004
Um, we'll call again.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.787
_ Our trustee
is looking for a buyer.

20:57.820 --> 20:59.481
Preston is mostly about divorce.

20:59.520 --> 21:00.589
That's why family law.

21:00.620 --> 21:01.780
What do we do?

21:01.820 --> 21:02.912
We could fight in court.

21:02.960 --> 21:03.949
The judge will side
with Clarke.

21:03.990 --> 21:07.323
We need $60 million
to get out from under him.

21:07.360 --> 21:09.555
We're at $12 million.

21:16.670 --> 21:17.739
MAN:
No, she was great.

21:17.770 --> 21:18.964
Just out of the military, right?

21:19.010 --> 21:20.671
Right. I just wanted
to offer a reference,

21:20.710 --> 21:21.938
tell you how great she is.

21:21.980 --> 21:23.379
Yeah, she seemed great.

21:23.410 --> 21:24.570
So, are you looking
for litigators

21:24.610 --> 21:26.373
with trial experience?

21:26.410 --> 21:29.447
Well, actually, between us,
we're not looking for anyone.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.414
You're not?

21:31.450 --> 21:33.589
Sh-She seemed to think
there was a job there.

21:33.620 --> 21:35.815
Well, we like
to keep our hand in.

21:35.860 --> 21:37.623
Meet and interview,
see who's out there.

21:37.660 --> 21:39.457
Same as you guys.

21:39.490 --> 21:41.799
So, are you going to tell her
there's no job?

21:42.960 --> 21:44.496
What do you mean?

21:44.530 --> 21:47.533
Well, she thinks it's
between her and someone else.

21:47.570 --> 21:48.867
(phone beeping)
Oh.

21:48.900 --> 21:51.368
Could you hold
for a moment, please?

21:51.410 --> 21:52.900
Hello.

21:52.940 --> 21:54.578
JEFFREY:
Hello. Is Cary there?

21:54.610 --> 21:56.373
Cary...? Oh. No.

21:56.410 --> 21:57.741
Mr. Agos?

21:57.780 --> 21:59.008
Uh, this is Alicia Florrick.

21:59.050 --> 22:00.347
I'm in 206.

22:00.380 --> 22:01.938
He's next door in 207.

22:01.980 --> 22:03.686
Ah. Well, my apologies.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.119
Thank you.

22:05.150 --> 22:07.584
Mr. Kolakowski? I'm...

22:07.620 --> 22:09.110
Hello?

22:09.160 --> 22:10.980
Hello...

22:15.130 --> 22:17.462
CARY (muffled):
Cary Agos.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.866
(Cary speaking indistinctly)

22:29.540 --> 22:32.646
CARY:
No, Ijust... I hadn't
seen him in years. He's...

22:32.680 --> 22:34.716
We're not very close.

22:34.750 --> 22:36.149
He's a lobbyist?

22:36.180 --> 22:38.489
Yeah. Yeah,
so is my mom.

22:38.520 --> 22:41.057
My new mom.

22:41.090 --> 22:43.081
You should have breakfast
with him.

22:44.090 --> 22:45.489
Why?

22:45.530 --> 22:47.020
Because he asked you.

22:47.060 --> 22:48.925
I said we were busy.
Maybe another time.

22:48.960 --> 22:50.496
Cary, we're not busy.

22:50.530 --> 22:53.021
He's... probably trying
to make amends.

22:53.070 --> 22:54.594
Call him back.

22:54.640 --> 22:55.766
Why?

22:55.800 --> 22:57.404
Because you only get

22:57.440 --> 22:59.704
so much family in life.

22:59.740 --> 23:02.777
This seems to matter more
to me than it does to you.

23:02.810 --> 23:04.675
Wait, no...

23:04.710 --> 23:06.541
more to you...
No, I just...

23:06.580 --> 23:08.719
It was nice to see you
with family.

23:08.750 --> 23:10.980
My dad kicked me
out the door when I was 18.

23:11.020 --> 23:13.557
'Cause his dad kicked him
out the door when he was 18.

23:13.590 --> 23:14.750
He never gave me a cent.

23:14.790 --> 23:16.655
Never wanted to know
what I was doing.

23:16.690 --> 23:18.783
When I got the deputyship at
the state's attorney's office,

23:18.830 --> 23:20.491
he never said a thing.
That's probably why

23:20.530 --> 23:21.827
he's calling now.

23:21.860 --> 23:24.124
To try to make up for it.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.092
People change on you.

23:26.130 --> 23:27.597
You changed on me.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.789
Me?

23:28.840 --> 23:31.536
No.
Oh, you don't notice it?

23:31.570 --> 23:33.731
You're tougher now.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.873
You're smarter
about things.

23:35.910 --> 23:37.605
Is that good or bad?

23:37.650 --> 23:39.208
Probably neither--
just necessary.

23:39.250 --> 23:41.218
(chuckles)
And you.

23:41.250 --> 23:43.946
You're nothing
like four years ago.

23:43.990 --> 23:46.584
I thought you were a jerk.

23:51.090 --> 23:53.024
Damn it.

23:53.060 --> 23:54.550
Immw.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.750
I think she's
on Bill Maher tonight.

23:56.800 --> 23:57.664
VVho?

23:57.700 --> 23:58.496
Therese.

23:58.530 --> 24:00.168
You two seemed to be
hitting it off.

24:00.200 --> 24:01.736
All that...

24:01.770 --> 24:03.067
breast humor, I guess.

24:03.100 --> 24:05.159
Well, that sounds
like pure pleasure.

24:05.210 --> 24:07.576
Yep. Going from office
to office,

24:07.610 --> 24:08.975
arguing with the FCC.

24:09.010 --> 24:11.774
I personally stripped
for each and every one of them.

24:11.810 --> 24:14.040
Uh-oh.

24:14.080 --> 24:14.978
BILL MAHER:
And how did

24:15.020 --> 24:16.112
that go over?

24:16.150 --> 24:18.584
Well, Commissioner
Gill took pictures,

24:18.620 --> 24:20.679
but he_said it was for
educational purposes.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.813
And Commissioner Bix...
No. No, don't.

24:22.860 --> 24:24.657
Oh, I don't know.

24:24.690 --> 24:25.987
She slipped me her number, but,

24:26.030 --> 24:28.658
you know, that can
mean anything.

24:28.700 --> 24:31.168
And did you
settle anything?

24:31.200 --> 24:32.622
Yes, we did.

24:32.670 --> 24:33.898
No more censorship.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.737
Aanhere. Ever.

24:35.770 --> 24:38.739
These breasts can do anything
when they set their minds to it.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.772
(laughter and applause)

24:48.620 --> 24:50.212
(indistinct chatter)

24:51.050 --> 24:52.540
So...

24:52.590 --> 24:54.217
I read about
your old boss.

24:54.260 --> 24:55.579
Florrick.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.724
He's got a tricky race
going on up there.

24:57.760 --> 25:00.126
You like him?
I do. He's a good guy.

25:00.160 --> 25:02.594
Not easy being a good guy
in that town.

25:02.630 --> 25:04.860
Your mother sent me
something you wrote.

25:04.900 --> 25:06.060
About...

25:06.100 --> 25:07.533
plea bargains.

25:07.570 --> 25:08.935
Negotiation techniques.

25:08.970 --> 25:10.733
With a human face.
Right.

25:10.770 --> 25:11.862
It was smart.

25:11.910 --> 25:12.865
I didn't understand all of it,

25:12.910 --> 25:14.730
but what I understood was...

25:14.780 --> 25:15.769
smart.

25:16.780 --> 25:18.042
Thank you.

25:22.850 --> 25:24.010
(chuckles)

25:24.050 --> 25:26.041
Cary.

25:27.050 --> 25:28.950
How are you doing?

25:28.990 --> 25:30.218
I'm good.

25:30.260 --> 25:31.557
You?

25:31.590 --> 25:33.228
I'm good, I guess.

25:33.260 --> 25:36.559
I don't know
how long any of us have,

25:36.600 --> 25:37.760
but I'm good.

25:37.800 --> 25:38.869
What do you mean?

25:38.900 --> 25:39.889
Nothing.
Ijust...

25:41.800 --> 25:44.803
I want to say something
before it's too late.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.308
I'm proud of you.

25:48.340 --> 25:50.649
And I'm sorry.

25:50.680 --> 25:52.341
I'm sorry that...

25:52.380 --> 25:54.974
we haven't been in touch.

25:57.050 --> 25:59.041
What do you mean, "too late"?

25:59.090 --> 26:00.819
Nothing. I'm just
talking. I...

26:01.860 --> 26:03.316
I think that we should...

26:03.360 --> 26:04.884
talk at some point.

26:04.930 --> 26:06.579
Dad, what is going on?

26:06.630 --> 26:07.722
ALICIA:
I'm so sorry

26:07.760 --> 26:10.627
to interrupt,
Cary. Mr. Agos.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.729
What's wrong?
Uh, we have a problem.

26:12.770 --> 26:13.737
Commissioner Martinez canceled.

26:13.770 --> 26:14.737
He canceled?

26:14.770 --> 26:15.589
Till when?

26:15.640 --> 26:16.891
No time.

26:16.940 --> 26:17.804
Damn it.

26:17.840 --> 26:19.899
Will and Diane would
like us to come back.

26:19.940 --> 26:21.805
It's the Bill Maher thing.

26:21.840 --> 26:23.307
That's what we're thinking.

26:23.340 --> 26:24.978
So sorry, Mr. Agos.

26:26.010 --> 26:28.274
Well, you should, uh,
go and...

26:28.320 --> 26:30.572
we'll talk soon.

26:34.090 --> 26:35.717
Dad, call me.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.159
Don't worry. I will.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.650
ELI:
So Maddie Hayward is not

26:41.700 --> 26:43.292
the campaign innocent
she pretends to be.

26:43.330 --> 26:44.820
We spoke
to the neighborhood watch,

26:44.870 --> 26:46.758
and they said they've seen
Indira Starr's car there

26:46.800 --> 26:47.767
for the last month.

26:47.800 --> 26:50.030
Before she went
to Synth magazme?

26:50.070 --> 26:51.799
So Maddie's been
playing us?

26:51.840 --> 26:53.307
That would make sense.
ELI: Okay.

26:53.340 --> 26:54.432
Things have just gotten ugly.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.903
Jim, get me everything
you can on Maddie. Kalinda...

26:56.940 --> 26:57.338
No, thanks.
Wait,

26:57.380 --> 26:58.699
where you going?

26:58.750 --> 27:00.377
I have a job, Eli.
Look, you knew this

27:00.410 --> 27:02.116
was temporary.
What are you doing?

27:02.150 --> 27:03.117
This is for Alicia

27:03.150 --> 27:04.378
as much as for Peter.

27:04.420 --> 27:06.217
Nice try, but no.

27:08.260 --> 27:10.387
(door opens)

27:14.830 --> 27:16.821
Yes?

27:17.830 --> 27:19.798
You're selling
us to Preston.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.339
I'm...

27:24.370 --> 27:26.838
considering your options.

27:26.870 --> 27:28.030
Your options.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.707
We don't have any options.

27:29.740 --> 27:31.207
You had six years
of options.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.308
So y-you're punishing us?

27:32.350 --> 27:33.408
I'm trying
to keep you

27:33.450 --> 27:35.145
from liquidation.
By destroying us?

27:35.180 --> 27:37.273
By selling us off in pieces?
No.

27:37.320 --> 27:38.389
By doing what I do:

27:38.420 --> 27:40.411
by looking where the money is
and where it isn't.

27:40.450 --> 27:43.010
This is not a subtle
business, Ms. Lockhart.

27:43.060 --> 27:44.755
There is either money
in the wallet or there isn't.

27:44.790 --> 27:46.155
And when there isn't,
wishing there is

27:46.190 --> 27:47.828
won't make it so.

27:58.070 --> 27:59.765
LAURA:
How was D.C.?

27:59.810 --> 28:01.038
ALICIA:
Good.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.206
Actually...

28:02.240 --> 28:03.377
it wasn't good.

28:03.410 --> 28:04.843
Oh, sorry.

28:04.880 --> 28:07.007
It's okay.
It's just work.

28:07.050 --> 28:08.449
How was interviewing?

28:08.480 --> 28:11.779
Fine. Hey, thanks for calling
Armstrong & Hayes.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.685
How did that go?

28:14.790 --> 28:17.054
I don't think
there's a job there.

28:17.090 --> 28:18.853
What did they say?

28:19.890 --> 28:21.221
There's no job there.

28:21.260 --> 28:23.194
But they said there was.

28:23.230 --> 28:25.027
Yes, they lied.
Why would
they do that?

28:25.070 --> 28:26.196
Because you're pretty,

28:26.230 --> 28:28.061
and they didn't want
to say no to you.

28:29.100 --> 28:31.102
Okay.
(chuckles)

28:32.410 --> 28:34.731
People aren't mean--
they're just

28:34.780 --> 28:36.202
polite liars.

28:36.240 --> 28:39.403
You went back on the job market
after how many years away?

28:39.450 --> 28:41.816
13, but I'm not
a fair comparison.

28:41.850 --> 28:43.477
The job market's
a lot harder now.
How many

28:43.520 --> 28:45.988
interviews did you have
before you got this?
Five.

28:46.020 --> 28:47.214
But I knew someone.

28:47.250 --> 28:48.217
Here.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.057
Do you know anyone, Laura?

28:50.090 --> 28:51.159
Anyone who could help you?

28:51.190 --> 28:53.124
Any connections?

28:53.160 --> 28:55.219
Probably? I don't
know, but...

28:55.260 --> 28:56.955
It's just the way
it is. People...

28:57.000 --> 28:58.888
hire people they know.

28:58.930 --> 29:00.966
It's not wrong.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.161
It just is.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.838
(laughing)

29:04.870 --> 29:06.508
So you need my help?

29:06.540 --> 29:08.770
We do.
It's in your
interest, David.

29:08.810 --> 29:11.176
You hate Burl Preston
as much as we do.

29:11.210 --> 29:12.768
He's not so bad.
DIANE: David.

29:12.810 --> 29:14.812
Burl Preston is trying
to buy this firm

29:14.850 --> 29:16.545
in order to control you.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.445
Do you want to be controlled?

29:18.490 --> 29:20.958
No. But I don't want
to be controlled

29:20.990 --> 29:22.309
by you either.
WILL: And if we promised

29:22.360 --> 29:23.452
you wouldn't be?

29:23.490 --> 29:26.050
Well, I'd be open to discussing.

29:26.090 --> 29:30.094
As long as my capital
contribution was part of it.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.968
(vibrating)

29:37.870 --> 29:38.837
Cary?

29:38.870 --> 29:39.837
Hi.

29:39.870 --> 29:41.030
I thought you were heading back.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.071
Uh... H was. I-I am.

29:43.110 --> 29:44.407
I'm in Chicago.

29:44.450 --> 29:45.576
Dad...

29:45.610 --> 29:47.271
(sighs)

29:47.310 --> 29:49.346
what were you trying
to say at breakfast?

29:50.380 --> 29:52.348
Dad.

29:52.390 --> 29:54.950
Whatever it is,
I can handle it.

29:54.990 --> 29:57.788
Look, it's very... hard
to talk about it, son.

29:58.860 --> 30:01.055
Your mother thinks
that I should wait.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.523
Dad, I am here.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.892
And I'm listening.

30:05.930 --> 30:07.932
(sighs)
All right.

30:09.340 --> 30:11.399
Do you know...

30:11.440 --> 30:15.103
Senator Byers of Illinois?

30:16.140 --> 30:17.437
Yeah.

30:17.480 --> 30:20.449
I have a chance to work
as her press secretary,

30:20.480 --> 30:23.472
but I need someone to put in
a good word with her.

30:23.520 --> 30:27.889
Now, I know that her best friend
is Diane Lockhart at your firm,

30:27.920 --> 30:31.356
and I was hoping
that you might ask her

30:31.390 --> 30:33.927
to put in that... good word.

30:35.360 --> 30:37.863
That's what you wanted
to talk about?

30:37.900 --> 30:39.299
Yes.

30:39.330 --> 30:40.866
And that's it?

30:40.900 --> 30:43.130
Yes, but... it's a lot, son.

30:43.170 --> 30:44.501
I know.

30:44.540 --> 30:47.361
And it would be
very helpful because...

30:47.410 --> 30:50.470
Senator Byers depends a lot
on personal recommendations.

30:50.510 --> 30:53.047
And I could talk
to Martinez for you, if...

30:53.080 --> 30:54.342
that would be helpful.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.476
Dad, I got to go.
They need me.

30:57.520 --> 30:58.612
So, you'll... do it?

30:58.650 --> 31:00.538
You'll... ask Diane Lockhart?

31:00.590 --> 31:02.615
I don't know. Let me...
let me think about it.

31:02.660 --> 31:05.151
Son, it would be very helpful.

31:05.190 --> 31:07.420
Well, I said I'd think about it.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.228
Come again?

31:12.270 --> 31:15.137
They are saying
that I have a mark...

31:15.170 --> 31:18.401
on my penis
shaped like Brazil.

31:19.710 --> 31:21.598
Uh...

31:21.640 --> 31:23.631
I...

31:23.680 --> 31:26.979
(laughs)

31:28.020 --> 31:29.271
Yeah.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.083
What does he want me to say?

31:31.120 --> 31:33.042
Well, that's a difficult one.

31:33.090 --> 31:35.149
"No"_would be
the obVIous answer.

31:36.190 --> 31:37.384
But...

31:37.420 --> 31:39.388
maybe mixed with some outrage.

31:39.430 --> 31:42.297
Yeah, I don't do outrage
well these days.

31:42.330 --> 31:44.264
How about laughter?

31:44.300 --> 31:46.996
Well... that would be easier.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.395
(chuckles)

31:48.440 --> 31:49.532
Good. Thank you.

31:49.570 --> 31:51.128
That's okay.

31:51.170 --> 31:52.660
Um...

31:52.710 --> 31:55.702
did you fill Cary's position at
the state's attorney's office?

31:55.740 --> 31:57.002
No, not yet.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.246
Why?

31:58.280 --> 31:59.542
Are you going to?

31:59.580 --> 32:02.310
Well, someday
when I have time.

32:02.350 --> 32:04.147
There's someone...

32:04.190 --> 32:06.215
I think you should consider.

32:06.250 --> 32:07.581
An ex-military lavwer.

32:07.620 --> 32:09.451
A captain. You'd like her.

32:09.490 --> 32:11.219
Really?

32:11.260 --> 32:12.625
Yeah.

32:12.660 --> 32:14.218
Do you mind considering her?

32:14.260 --> 32:15.727
I don't.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.557
Do you mind talking
to the press?

32:17.600 --> 32:19.067
Nope.

32:19.100 --> 32:20.260
Good.

32:20.300 --> 32:21.369
It's a deal.

32:21.400 --> 32:22.367
Thanks.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.129
You, too.

32:24.170 --> 32:26.161
Bye.

32:50.500 --> 32:51.626
KALIN DA:
Well, you two

32:51.670 --> 32:53.092
are cheerful.

32:53.130 --> 32:54.995
We've been frozen out.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.099
The last FCC commissioner
doesn't want to hear us.

32:57.140 --> 32:58.459
KALINDA:
It's worse.
I made a few calls,

32:58.510 --> 33:00.603
and Commissioner Martinez

33:00.640 --> 33:03.302
is still meeting
with Parents Against Indecency.

33:03.340 --> 33:04.500
Great.

33:04.550 --> 33:06.199
He doesn't want to
meet With you guys,

33:06.250 --> 33:09.378
but he's still meeting
the opposition tomorrow at 6:00.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.688
One thing we
could try...

33:12.720 --> 33:15.188
Yes?
We go.

33:15.220 --> 33:16.209
Go where?

33:16.260 --> 33:18.228
Martinez at 6:00.

33:18.260 --> 33:20.251
We were
disinvited.

33:20.290 --> 33:21.359
We never got the message.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.355
We know he
wanted to hear

33:22.400 --> 33:25.221
from both Parents
Against Indecency and us,

33:25.270 --> 33:26.726
and we never got
the disinvite.

33:26.770 --> 33:28.533
You crash it.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.368
(airplane whooshing)

33:32.410 --> 33:33.707
(elevator bell dings)

33:35.740 --> 33:38.800
No, this is the new me.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.375
Smell my perfume;
it's called Accommodation.

33:41.420 --> 33:42.375
(sniffs)

33:42.420 --> 33:43.648
Oh, it's nice.

33:43.680 --> 33:44.783
Thanks.

33:44.820 --> 33:46.811
I'll catch up with you.

33:46.850 --> 33:49.114
So you're not going
to call?

33:49.160 --> 33:50.752
You're going to ignore
your own father?

33:50.790 --> 33:52.121
Yep.
I only need

33:52.160 --> 33:53.752
one call to Diane Lockhart.

33:53.790 --> 33:56.520
And I only needed
one call on my birthday,

33:56.560 --> 33:58.664
one call when I
was out of work.

33:58.700 --> 34:00.065
Did you know I was

34:00.100 --> 34:01.135
the youngest deputy
state's attorney ever?

34:01.170 --> 34:02.137
Did you know that?

34:02.170 --> 34:03.762
We don't do that, Cary.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.734
Other families gush.

34:05.770 --> 34:08.534
You know how I pay
a compliment to you now?

34:08.580 --> 34:10.275
By needing something
from you.

34:10.310 --> 34:11.709
(sighs)
Dad.

34:11.750 --> 34:15.470
No... no.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.841
A few years ago I'd jump
at the chance to impress you,

34:17.880 --> 34:19.745
but it's over.

34:21.790 --> 34:24.452
I won't be calling you again.

34:25.590 --> 34:27.581
My loss.

34:29.460 --> 34:31.428
ALICIA:
I'm so sorry,

34:31.470 --> 34:32.562
I didn't get the message.

34:32.600 --> 34:33.567
Cary?

34:33.600 --> 34:34.737
My gosh, no,
I didn't either.

34:34.770 --> 34:36.169
Y-You were canceling?

34:36.200 --> 34:38.430
Yes, just a scheduling logjam.

34:38.470 --> 34:40.461
PRESTON:
Well, now that
we're all here...

34:42.340 --> 34:44.308
...it seems only fair.

34:44.350 --> 34:46.306
DODD:
All I wanted to do

34:46.350 --> 34:50.241
was to make women aware
of breast cancer.

34:50.280 --> 34:51.383
And disrobing was
making them aware?

34:51.420 --> 34:53.388
Would I do it
that way again? No,

34:53.420 --> 34:57.413
but women needed to see
something memorable,

34:57.460 --> 34:58.859
something to
provoke them.

34:58.890 --> 35:00.084
I'm impressed,
Ms. Dodd.

35:00.130 --> 35:02.758
Thank you, Commissioner.
But what I have trouble
reconCIling

35:02.800 --> 35:05.325
is this new Therese
with the Therese

35:05.370 --> 35:06.667
that told
this joke:

35:06.700 --> 35:10.158
"Rape is never funny.

35:10.200 --> 35:14.136
Unless you're raped
by a clown."

35:14.180 --> 35:15.329
How is this funny,
Ms. Dodd?

35:15.380 --> 35:16.870
Sir, that wasn't part
of the original act.

35:16.910 --> 35:18.002
I understand that,

35:18.040 --> 35:21.441
but I find myself confused
by Ms. Dodd's sense of humor.

35:21.480 --> 35:22.879
Do you know
that every 45 seconds,

35:22.920 --> 35:24.182
there is another _
sexual assault in America?

35:24.220 --> 35:26.142
So I'm not sure

35:26.190 --> 35:27.509
how rape is funny.

35:28.890 --> 35:30.858
CARY:
The joke isn't
about rape, sir.

35:30.890 --> 35:32.858
It's about a ridiculous
juxtap05ition.

35:32.890 --> 35:34.790
But it makes light of rape,
doesn't it?

35:34.830 --> 35:36.229
Shall I read it
again?

35:36.260 --> 35:37.693
I think, sir,
you're trying to make a point

35:37.730 --> 35:39.527
by putting Ms. Dodd on the spot.

35:39.570 --> 35:40.719
Sir, we didn't come...
DODD:
You're right.

35:40.770 --> 35:42.499
It's not funny,
Commissioner.

35:42.540 --> 35:43.893
Therese.
What?

35:43.940 --> 35:44.907
He's right.

35:44.940 --> 35:47.704
Rape is never funny,

35:47.740 --> 35:49.503
and the association
of clowns

35:49.540 --> 35:52.441
and rape is just offensive,

35:52.480 --> 35:54.914
and I feel terrible
that I wrote it.

35:54.950 --> 35:55.917
MARTINEZ:
Thank you, ma'am,

35:55.950 --> 35:58.783
but then I find
myself asking,

35:58.820 --> 36:00.549
why do you tell these jokes?

36:01.820 --> 36:05.620
Because I have a potty mouth.

36:05.660 --> 36:07.787
Are you making fun

36:07.830 --> 36:08.899
of me, Ms. Dodd?
No.

36:08.930 --> 36:10.818
Never...

36:10.860 --> 36:12.760
Because that's why
we have standards--

36:12.800 --> 36:14.392
to protect the viewers
from indecency like this.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.395
PRESTON:
Well, if the question

36:15.440 --> 36:16.668
is about protecting viewers,

36:16.700 --> 36:18.804
they voted with their remotes.

36:18.840 --> 36:19.807
There are more viewers

36:19.840 --> 36:22.479
watching the show
than ever.

36:22.510 --> 36:25.377
Okay, so I must ask you,
Ms. Dodd,

36:25.410 --> 36:27.947
will you sign a pledge
that you will never do

36:27.980 --> 36:31.586
anything like this
on TV again?

36:32.590 --> 36:34.683
Ms. Dodd?

36:52.870 --> 36:55.009
I think that's a yes.

36:55.040 --> 36:58.248
I was in the JAG Corps
for 12 years

36:58.280 --> 37:00.840
and before that,
I attended SLS.

37:00.880 --> 37:02.939
SLS?

37:02.980 --> 37:03.969
S-Stanford Law.

37:04.020 --> 37:05.544
Oh, I thought
that was

37:05.590 --> 37:07.285
military jargon.

37:07.320 --> 37:08.753
No.

37:09.820 --> 37:12.380
I grew up in California--
Huntington Beach.

37:12.430 --> 37:14.421
Was your dad
in the military?

37:14.460 --> 37:18.567
No, a professor
of neurobiology at Irvine.

37:18.600 --> 37:19.567
Brothers?

37:19.600 --> 37:21.329
No, two sisters,
though.

37:21.370 --> 37:23.031
Why did you
enlist, then?

37:23.070 --> 37:24.401
I don't know.
They needed lawyers.

37:24.440 --> 37:25.407
(chuckles)

37:25.440 --> 37:26.862
(chuckles)

37:26.910 --> 37:28.730
Well, we're not really
short-staffed at the moment,

37:28.780 --> 37:29.804
but we're always looking,

37:29.840 --> 37:32.707
so we'll keep this rsum
on file.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.308
Have you tried the
public defenders' office?

37:34.350 --> 37:35.840
They're always in need of...
(door opens)

37:35.880 --> 37:37.916
Mr. Florrick, hello.

37:37.950 --> 37:39.542
Hi, Geneva.

37:39.590 --> 37:40.545
And you must be

37:40.590 --> 37:41.989
Captain Hellinger.

37:42.020 --> 37:43.385
Oh, yes, sir.

37:43.420 --> 37:44.956
Wonderful to meet you.

37:44.990 --> 37:46.355
You're looking for a job, huh?

37:46.390 --> 37:48.358
I am, sir.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.753
And you know how little we pay?

37:49.800 --> 37:50.824
I've heard rumors.

37:50.860 --> 37:52.760
You could live on that?

37:52.800 --> 37:53.892
I tend to be frugal.

37:53.930 --> 37:55.636
Well, that's good.

37:55.670 --> 37:56.637
When can you begin?

37:56.670 --> 37:57.989
Now,

37:58.040 --> 37:59.507
I mean, if you want.

37:59.540 --> 38:01.679
That's great.

38:01.710 --> 38:03.029
Here's your first case:

38:03.080 --> 38:03.876
breaking and entering.

38:03.910 --> 38:05.639
Geneva will set you up
with a cubicle.

38:05.680 --> 38:06.647
Welcome aboard.

38:06.680 --> 38:08.773
Thank you so much.

38:10.420 --> 38:12.388
(door opens)

38:12.420 --> 38:14.388
(door closes)

38:14.420 --> 38:16.513
Um, thank you for your help.

38:23.400 --> 38:24.765
Your Honor, there is still
the question of damages.

38:24.800 --> 38:25.619
No, there is the
question of whether

38:25.670 --> 38:26.898
your negotiations
have borne fruit.

38:26.930 --> 38:27.828
PRESTON:
We made an effort

38:27.870 --> 38:30.737
to reach such a settlement,
Your Honor, but

38:30.770 --> 38:32.761
the results depend
on something yet to be decided.

38:32.810 --> 38:33.765
WILL:
Mr. Preston

38:33.810 --> 38:35.038
is being coy.

38:35.080 --> 38:38.470
We agreed to argue in front of
the FCC on the network's behalf,

38:38.510 --> 38:39.772
and if the FCC decided
favorably,

38:39.810 --> 38:40.902
this lawsuit would go away.

38:40.950 --> 38:41.746
I see.

38:41.780 --> 38:43.941
And the FCC hasn't decided?
Not yet,

38:43.980 --> 38:45.481
but we believe this suit
should be dismissed

38:45.520 --> 38:47.408
on the basis
of an absence of damages.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.589
Damages have already been
established, Your Honor--

38:49.620 --> 38:51.759
the many affiliates dropping
our show.
Yes,

38:51.790 --> 38:53.929
but Mr. Preston recently argued
in front of the FCC

38:53.960 --> 38:54.756
that there has been

38:54.800 --> 38:56.620
a corresponding rise
in viewership--

38:56.660 --> 38:59.823
a rise large enough to more
than offset the affiliate loss.

39:01.070 --> 39:03.038
That was an argument
in another venue.

39:03.070 --> 39:03.832
Your Honor,

39:03.870 --> 39:06.600
this suit is _
an attempt to punish

39:06.640 --> 39:08.801
Therese, that's all.

39:08.840 --> 39:10.637
There are
no actual damages here,

39:10.680 --> 39:12.500
and this suit
should be dismissed.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.948
Would you care
for some water?

39:18.990 --> 39:20.787
No.

39:20.820 --> 39:22.708
My firm will absorb

39:22.760 --> 39:24.751
the debt of Lockhart/Gardner

39:24.790 --> 39:27.452
and pay out existing
capital contributions

39:27.490 --> 39:28.957
of existing
equity partners,

39:29.000 --> 39:32.925
but all severance packages
will be the responsibility

39:32.970 --> 39:34.790
of the existing partners.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.467
Yes, and you agree to honor

39:36.500 --> 39:38.536
the contracts of
eXIsting partners.

39:38.570 --> 39:40.458
Only up to a year
of the purchase date.

39:40.510 --> 39:41.477
That's fine.

39:41.510 --> 39:43.034
The, the current lease

39:43.080 --> 39:44.775
will be subject to...
DAVID:
Hello,

39:44.810 --> 39:46.801
Burl.

39:47.810 --> 39:50.916
David... what can
we do for you?

39:50.950 --> 39:52.542
Oh, I'm just watching.

39:52.590 --> 39:53.340
Conﬁnue.

39:53.390 --> 39:55.585
Mr. Lee, this is
a private matter.

39:55.620 --> 39:57.087
It's far from private.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.725
I'm just waiting
for my emancipation.

39:59.760 --> 40:00.727
Go ahead.

40:00.760 --> 40:02.489
Your emancipation?

40:02.530 --> 40:03.349
Yes.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.595
This firm has
a stranglehold on me,

40:05.630 --> 40:07.928
but as soon as you purchase it,
I'm free.

40:07.970 --> 40:08.937
Hallelujah.

40:08.970 --> 40:10.130
You're not free.

40:10.170 --> 40:11.068
You're committed
to Lockhart/Gardner.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.762
No, the partners just
rewrote my contract.

40:13.810 --> 40:14.879
If this firm is sold

40:14.910 --> 40:18.129
or absorbed, I am free to leave.

40:18.180 --> 40:19.499
They can't do that.

40:19.550 --> 40:20.778
Yes, they can.

40:20.810 --> 40:22.949
_Yo_u_can veto
their hiring deCI5ions.

40:22.980 --> 40:25.039
_ You_can_'t veto
a nonfinanCIal Side agreement

40:25.090 --> 40:28.048
in a partnership contract.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.679
The firm is still
in fine shape.

40:32.730 --> 40:34.721
No, thank you.

40:34.760 --> 40:36.489
Good luck
with this place.

40:36.530 --> 40:38.054
Unfortunately

40:38.100 --> 40:42.196
they enjoy intrigue more
than they do making money.

40:54.150 --> 40:55.640
You told your husband
to hire me?

40:55.680 --> 40:58.649
No.
He hired me.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.043
Congratulations.

41:00.090 --> 41:01.045
You didn't say

41:01.090 --> 41:02.250
anything to him?
Well,

41:02.290 --> 41:04.724
I said you were
a good lavwer.

41:05.760 --> 41:07.819
Okay.

41:07.860 --> 41:09.020
This is all new to me.

41:09.060 --> 41:10.049
What, friends
didn't help

41:10.100 --> 41:12.022
friends in the military?
They did,

41:12.070 --> 41:13.719
but never me.
Well,

41:13.770 --> 41:16.159
baptism by fire.

41:21.710 --> 41:23.905
Yes?

41:23.940 --> 41:26.204
You're cutting
your own throats!

41:26.250 --> 41:29.674
Do you know how hard it is
to find a suitor like that?!

41:29.720 --> 41:31.073
Yes, that's why
we did it.

41:31.120 --> 41:34.214
You're losing this firm.

41:34.250 --> 41:35.410
Is that a threat?

41:35.460 --> 41:39.954
Take it any way you want,
but you are losing this firm.

41:39.990 --> 41:42.550
Mr. Hayden, you should take
a step back.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.693
You've obviously become
too invested in our firm.

41:44.730 --> 41:46.061
(scoffs)

41:46.100 --> 41:47.567
You don't know me.

41:47.600 --> 41:48.965
I don't step back.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.069
We don't either.

41:50.100 --> 41:52.102
Then get ready to crash.

41:58.610 --> 42:00.749
I just heard the FCC isn't
going to fine the network.

42:00.780 --> 42:02.748
Yeah, yeah, you're
off the hook.

42:02.780 --> 42:03.974
Good.

42:04.020 --> 42:08.719
I have to head out to LA,
so I wanted to say thank you.

42:08.760 --> 42:11.581
Have a good trip.

42:11.630 --> 42:13.985
I will.

42:14.030 --> 42:18.763
I'm not great with byes, so bye.

42:23.670 --> 42:26.002
What'd she say?

42:26.040 --> 42:27.928
Good-bye.

42:27.970 --> 42:29.232
That's it?

42:29.280 --> 42:30.338
Yeah.

42:30.380 --> 42:32.007
She didn't say anything else?

42:32.050 --> 42:33.278
No, why?

42:33.310 --> 42:35.312
Well, why did
she kiss you yesterday?

42:36.320 --> 42:38.914
She's a comedian.

42:38.950 --> 42:40.281
DODD:
I've spent the last week

42:40.320 --> 42:44.017
with my lavwer, trying
desperately not to say anything

42:44.060 --> 42:46.881
about Brazil and penises.

42:46.930 --> 42:49.228
I suppose there are
worse birthmarks to have.

42:49.260 --> 42:51.023
Like Greece.

42:51.060 --> 42:53.290
I mean, who wants a penis
that's always

42:53.330 --> 42:55.696
in recession?

42:55.740 --> 42:58.368
My lawyer says,
it really only looks like Brazil

42:58.400 --> 42:59.628
when it's erect.

42:59.670 --> 43:01.228
Otherwise it's more
like New Jersey.
