WEBVTT

00:10.444 --> 00:13.714
"School board approves
emotional support squirrels."

00:13.814 --> 00:15.116
Hmm.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.618
When I was a kid, you couldn't
even chew gum in school.

00:19.653 --> 00:20.888
Why do you still
get the newspaper?

00:20.988 --> 00:22.590
Why don't you just
get it on the app?

00:22.690 --> 00:26.060
Babe, 'cause I like
to do more than read my news.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.362
I like to feel my news.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.498
I also like to...

00:30.598 --> 00:32.333
hear my news.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.503
Oh, uh, you left this
in your pants pocket. Ah.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.938
"Jake Walker, Thaxton
Capital Partners"?

00:38.038 --> 00:41.375
Good. You know what,
I was looking for this.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.046
So you could murder it?

00:47.448 --> 00:49.517
Okay, what's going on?

00:49.617 --> 00:51.085
Who is this guy?

00:51.185 --> 00:53.421
Eh, it's just a guy
that made me an insulting offer

00:53.521 --> 00:54.622
to buy the Pit Stop.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.724
What? But who said
it was for sale?

00:56.824 --> 01:00.128
Nobody. See, this is
what I've been fighting.

01:00.228 --> 01:01.529
Gentrification.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.331
See, they think that
they can come in,

01:03.431 --> 01:06.534
wave a check in your face
and just buy you out.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.402
Why didn't you tell me
about this?

01:08.502 --> 01:10.471
For the same reason
I don't tell you

01:10.571 --> 01:13.341
when Dave asks me
to go antiquing.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.042
It ain't never gonna happen.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.212
I didn't even look at the offer.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.981
Oh, well, good for you.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.350
Fight the power.

01:22.450 --> 01:25.153
You know, they're doing
this all over town.

01:25.253 --> 01:28.055
You build it up and then
they just come in and take it.

01:28.156 --> 01:30.291
That's what they do.

01:31.492 --> 01:32.960
Who is they?

01:33.060 --> 01:35.163
They is them.

01:35.163 --> 01:37.631
Well, they ain't gonna
do us like that,

01:37.731 --> 01:38.999
because we ain't them.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.168
That's right.

01:40.168 --> 01:42.170
Ooh, that might be them.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.975
Oh, hey, Calvin.

01:48.075 --> 01:50.043
Gemma and I are gonna
go antiquing. You in?

01:50.178 --> 01:51.979
Oh, sure, Dave.
Give me a minute.

01:52.079 --> 01:53.781
All right.

01:53.881 --> 01:55.716
It ain't gonna happen.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.552
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:58.652 --> 02:00.188
♪ Welcome to the hood. ♪

02:02.590 --> 02:04.492
Oh, somebody
brought croissants?

02:06.026 --> 02:07.428
Which one of y'all
trying to get the day off?

02:07.528 --> 02:09.430
Ah.

02:09.530 --> 02:10.764
I see you got the croissants.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.466
Ah, Jake.
These are from you?

02:13.267 --> 02:15.469
I already told you
I'm not selling.

02:15.569 --> 02:16.870
But I'm keeping
these croissants.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.939
Hey, I bought
everybody croissants.

02:19.039 --> 02:20.974
That's not what I heard.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.211
Would you just give me your keys

02:23.211 --> 02:25.213
and I'll call you
when your car's ready?

02:26.214 --> 02:27.881
Okay.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.518
So, Calvin,

02:30.618 --> 02:32.386
I'm assuming you didn't
look at our offer.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.855
Well, you would be
assuming correctly.

02:34.955 --> 02:39.227
You just let them know
that they ain't getting this.

02:40.228 --> 02:40.961
I hear you.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.296
Can you do me a favor

02:42.396 --> 02:43.864
and just take a quick look
at our offer

02:43.964 --> 02:45.533
so I can tell my bosses you did?

02:45.633 --> 02:48.702
You know, you seem
like a fine young man.

02:48.802 --> 02:51.239
So for you,
I'll look at it.

02:51.239 --> 02:53.507
But it doesn't matter
what this number is.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.043
I'm still not selling.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.111
Good lord!

02:58.246 --> 02:59.747
Is that the offer

02:59.847 --> 03:02.316
or is this
an international phone number?

03:02.416 --> 03:03.851
That's the offer.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.287
Would you like a croissant?

03:06.387 --> 03:09.056
No, Calvin,
that's all you.

03:09.156 --> 03:10.591
Let me know
if you want to talk.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.160
My actual phone number's
the little one in the corner.

03:13.261 --> 03:17.130
Oh, hey, Calvi...
Ooh, croissants.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.599
I know you said
business was slow,

03:18.699 --> 03:20.067
so I brought my car in.

03:20.167 --> 03:21.402
I don't think there's
anything wrong with it,

03:21.502 --> 03:23.003
but here's to hoping
you'll find something.

03:23.103 --> 03:25.806
I hope you don't do this
with your doctor.

03:26.707 --> 03:27.875
Better safe than sorry.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.610
Hey, who was that guy
who just walked out?

03:29.710 --> 03:31.712
He smelled great.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.113
Is a real estate guy.

03:33.281 --> 03:34.948
He made me an offer
to buy the Pit Stop.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.984
Oh. Was it a good offer?

03:37.084 --> 03:38.852
It was a great offer.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.454
Well, congratulations.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.456
My shop is not for sale.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.591
So, you told him no?

03:43.691 --> 03:44.892
No, I didn't tell him no.

03:44.992 --> 03:47.027
You don't say no
to an offer this great.

03:47.127 --> 03:48.095
So, you're gonna say yes?

03:48.195 --> 03:50.798
What part of "not for sale"

03:50.898 --> 03:52.466
do you not understand?

03:54.868 --> 03:57.805
This is for
the Pit Stop, right?

03:57.905 --> 03:58.972
Yes.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.342
And they've seen the place?

04:01.442 --> 04:02.776
Yes.

04:02.876 --> 04:06.079
It's a successful business
in a hot part of town.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.916
What are you doing?

04:09.016 --> 04:10.651
I'm trying to make sure
that this comma

04:10.751 --> 04:12.986
isn't a smudge.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.055
It's not a smudge.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.857
And that comma doesn't
change anything.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.992
Oh, that comma could change me

04:19.092 --> 04:21.161
into someone who sunbathes
naked on a yacht!

04:21.329 --> 04:23.364
Ooh.

04:23.464 --> 04:26.033
Naked and yacht
do go together.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.435
You know what I'm saying?
I told you.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.002
We can have fun on the water.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.372
Look, uh... But the Pit Stop
is not for sale.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.841
You know what, you always get me
with that naked and yacht thing.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.744
Stop doing me like
that, you know?

04:37.545 --> 04:40.681
Okay, Dave, how many times
do I have to tell you

04:40.781 --> 04:42.383
Pictionary Night
is not happening?

04:42.483 --> 04:44.985
We will fight that battle
another day.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.555
This is to help with
your Pit Stop decision.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.523
We can make a list of
the pros and cons of selling.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.859
This exercise
helps my therapy patients

04:51.959 --> 04:54.061
get clarity
with big life decisions.

04:54.161 --> 04:56.096
And I could tell
you were waffling.

04:56.196 --> 04:58.566
He was waffling?
Huh, like a Belgian.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.200
I was not waffling.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.403
Aw, come on, baby.
Let's give it a try.

05:02.503 --> 05:05.105
I'm tired of wearing clothes.
On land.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.874
Okay, Tina...

05:06.974 --> 05:08.275
would you stop, please?

05:08.376 --> 05:10.378
It's hard for me
to make a clear decision

05:10.478 --> 05:13.514
when you keep being
naked in my head.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.553
This isn't a communal
hamper, Malcolm.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.089
I'm not washing
your stuff anymore.

05:22.189 --> 05:23.757
Hey, man, this isn't mine.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.959
W... Well, it's not mine.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.395
Maybe it's Necie's.

05:27.395 --> 05:29.196
Why would Necie have a triple XL

05:29.296 --> 05:30.798
Alabama football sweatshirt?

05:30.898 --> 05:34.201
I don't know, Marty.
She's your fiancée.

05:37.137 --> 05:40.641
Wow. Okay.

05:40.741 --> 05:41.809
What's okay?

05:41.909 --> 05:43.276
Apparently everything.

05:43.411 --> 05:44.412
What is everything?

05:44.512 --> 05:45.646
You know what?
Nothing.

05:45.746 --> 05:46.814
No, no, no, no.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.417
No, no, no, no, no,
No, no, no.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.885
Everything means something.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.321
Okay, fine.
If she were my fiancée,

05:54.422 --> 05:57.324
I would just be a little
curious about where she got it.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.660
I don't know, like maybe
that's an ex-boyfriend's.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.228
Okay, so,
what if it is?

06:01.328 --> 06:04.665
Wow, clearly, you are a
bigger man than I am.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.767
Not as big as him.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.636
This...

06:10.838 --> 06:12.339
Okay. Pros.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.743
If you sell the Pit Stop, what
about your life gets better?

06:15.843 --> 06:17.578
Well, I could stop
worrying about

06:17.678 --> 06:19.980
Motor Boys stealing
all of my customers.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.181
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

06:21.281 --> 06:23.050
I, uh...

06:23.150 --> 06:24.452
I don't know
what that says.

06:24.552 --> 06:27.455
It says
"Motor Boys can kiss my ass."

06:29.457 --> 06:30.924
Um, well, uh, it's not legible.

06:31.024 --> 06:34.261
Who cares? It's my list,
I know what it says.

06:34.361 --> 06:35.963
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna write.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.198
Here we go, here
we go. All right.

06:38.298 --> 06:39.633
What's next?

06:39.733 --> 06:41.669
Um, no more getting up
at the crack of dawn?

06:41.769 --> 06:44.237
Oh, yeah. Crack of dawn
can kiss my ass.

06:44.337 --> 06:45.338
All right.

06:45.473 --> 06:46.807
Why don't we just make the list,

06:46.907 --> 06:49.810
and assume that everything on it
can kiss your ass?

06:50.811 --> 06:52.279
Oh, here's a pro.

06:52.379 --> 06:53.747
No more working weekends.

06:53.847 --> 06:54.982
Mm.
Mm.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.618
Uh, no more dealing with
deadbeat customers,

06:57.718 --> 06:58.952
your bad back.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.253
Yeah, yeah.

07:00.488 --> 07:01.489
All of those things can indeed

07:01.489 --> 07:03.491
kiss my entire ass.

07:03.491 --> 07:05.092
More time with neighbors.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.994
Uh, uh, that's a con.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.563
No, it's not.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.700
Um, afternoon Dodger games.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.136
Mm.
Afternoon golf.
Afternoon naps.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.739
Mm-hmm. Afternoon,
you know...

07:20.373 --> 07:21.642
Huh? Huh?

07:23.911 --> 07:27.214
Oh, here. I have a pro.
Put N-O-Y.

07:27.314 --> 07:28.381
What's that?

07:28.516 --> 07:29.883
Naked on a yacht.
Naked on a yacht.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.885
Oh, okay.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.554
Now, Calvin,

07:33.654 --> 07:35.188
that's a lot of pros.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.626
Now let's talk about the cons
of selling the Pit Stop.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.962
Yeah, but there's a...

07:42.062 --> 07:43.931
You got the, uh...

07:45.032 --> 07:46.199
Calvin,
um...

07:46.299 --> 07:48.435
it seems like
you've got nothing.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.437
It's pretty clear

07:50.538 --> 07:52.606
that the board
is telling you something.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.776
Well, the board doesn't
have everything on it.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.245
Okay, well, what's
it missing?

07:58.345 --> 08:03.551
To be honest,
I-I am 200 cars short

08:03.551 --> 08:05.619
of beating my daddy's record

08:05.719 --> 08:09.923
for most tires rotated.

08:10.691 --> 08:13.393
Man, please, you
just made that up.
Mm-hmm.

08:14.261 --> 08:15.596
It's a real record, Tina.

08:15.696 --> 08:18.298
And if anybody's gonna beat it,
it's gonna be me.

08:18.398 --> 08:20.801
All right,
I'm not selling the shop.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.036
I want my daddy's record!

08:32.479 --> 08:33.714
Oh.

08:33.814 --> 08:37.117
Hey, Marty, what's up?
Hey, Dave. Uh, this

08:37.217 --> 08:39.252
is a little awkward,
but I need some advice.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.721
How is that awkward?
You know,

08:40.821 --> 08:43.156
I actually had a dream
about you coming to me.

08:43.924 --> 08:47.595
I found this in the laundry,
and I'm afraid it means

08:47.595 --> 08:49.396
Necie still cares
about her ex-boyfriend

08:49.496 --> 08:52.800
and he is big and muscular

08:52.900 --> 08:54.802
and he played football at
Alabama and now he's in the NFL

08:54.902 --> 08:56.503
and, like, what does
she even see in me?!

08:56.604 --> 09:01.308
O-Okay, Mar-Marty, Marty,
you're spinning out.

09:01.408 --> 09:03.210
Okay?
Now, let's calm down.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.444
Take a deep breath.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.346
Have you spoken
to Necie about this?

09:06.446 --> 09:08.381
She's in Chicago
visiting her parents,

09:08.481 --> 09:10.250
and I don't want her
to think I'm crazy.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.620
Unless I am crazy.
Am I crazy?!

09:12.720 --> 09:15.022
No, you're not crazy,

09:15.122 --> 09:17.625
but it sounds like
you're feeling jealous.

09:17.625 --> 09:20.260
Okay? And jealousy can
make us irrational.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.095
Hey, Marty.
What's up?

09:22.195 --> 09:23.831
I'm crazy!

09:23.931 --> 09:25.966
No... no, he's not crazy.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.069
He j... He found this
in Necie's laundry.

09:29.169 --> 09:32.706
Alabama football?
Oh, my God.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.708
Did Niece date a
player from Alabama?

09:34.808 --> 09:36.677
That's a great program.
Lot of Heismans.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.311
Is he in the NFL?

09:38.411 --> 09:40.280
Oh...

09:41.248 --> 09:42.349
What?
Okay.

09:42.449 --> 09:44.785
What, what'd I say?
Okay, but...

09:44.885 --> 09:48.521
but what if football players
are really her type

09:48.656 --> 09:50.658
and she's just
nerd-slumming it with me?!

09:50.658 --> 09:53.026
Ok... Again, Marty,

09:53.126 --> 09:54.494
calm down.

09:54.662 --> 09:58.832
Look, Necie has made her choice.
And her choice is you.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.770
Okay, Dave.
Maybe you're right.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.673
Thanks.
You are so enlightened.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.074
Oh, thanks.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.909
But I just care about women. Aw.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.144
You know, some call me an ally.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.545
Others agree.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.715
Be like Dave.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.917
I wear my ex-boyfriend's
hockey jersey

10:17.017 --> 10:19.552
and he couldn't be
less bothered by it.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.121
Huh.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.457
Thought that was yours.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.995
No, Dave. It's Brian's.
I've told you that.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.963
And Dave doesn't
care at all.

10:30.063 --> 10:33.400
Yeah.
Not at all.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.202
I'm the guy that guys come to

10:35.302 --> 10:36.804
when something like that
bothers them.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.906
Yeah, I am evolved.

10:42.910 --> 10:44.778
Yo, Marty.
Oh, hey, guys.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.179
Sorry to bust on in,

10:46.279 --> 10:47.580
but I have good news.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.616
Remember two weekends ago
when I invited the guys over

10:49.717 --> 10:50.818
to watch the Rams game?

10:50.918 --> 10:52.452
Rams is football, right?

10:52.552 --> 10:54.354
Oh.

10:54.454 --> 10:57.224
Yes, that's right, and that's
why I did not invite you.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.327
Anyway, there were
a bunch of guys.

11:00.427 --> 11:03.430
It was Trey, Big Julius,
Little Julius, and, uh, Richard.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.365
I thought the Juliuses
hated each other.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.467
Yes, they did, but now
they all hate Richard.

11:07.567 --> 11:08.736
And it got kind of awkward.

11:08.736 --> 11:11.004
Yeah.
But anyway,

11:11.104 --> 11:14.107
I forgot that Big Julius spilled
queso all over his sweatshirt.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.777
His Alabama football sweatshirt.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.478
Big Julius played
football at Alabama?

11:18.578 --> 11:21.882
No, Gemma, Big Julius went to
Dick's and bought a sweatshirt.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.219
Well, this
is good news.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.121
That's great, Marty,

11:28.221 --> 11:30.290
But, again,
it never really mattered

11:30.390 --> 11:31.458
whose sweatshirt it was.

11:31.558 --> 11:32.525
Right, Dave?
Right.

11:32.625 --> 11:33.827
Or how intimate she was

11:33.927 --> 11:35.763
with the person
who gave it to her.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.835
Hey, babe, what you reading?

11:41.935 --> 11:43.771
Oh, since you asked,

11:43.871 --> 11:46.273
why don't you want to sell
the Pit Stop?

11:46.373 --> 11:49.142
Hmm. That's an odd name
for a book.

11:51.779 --> 11:54.081
I can't stop thinking...

11:54.181 --> 11:57.117
I mean, is it that
crazy of an idea?

11:57.217 --> 11:59.119
If you took that offer,
you could retire.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.520
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

12:00.620 --> 12:02.790
It'd be horrible.

12:02.790 --> 12:05.258
In my family, no one retires.

12:05.358 --> 12:08.361
All my relatives
have died on the job.

12:09.662 --> 12:12.099
It is my destiny to die

12:12.199 --> 12:15.035
underneath
an '88 Cutlass Supreme.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.706
Baby, don't you think
your relatives kept working

12:19.807 --> 12:21.408
because they had to?

12:21.508 --> 12:23.043
If you sold the shop,

12:23.143 --> 12:26.179
you could be the first Butler
to not have to die on the job.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.948
If I sell the Pit Stop,

12:28.048 --> 12:30.017
then I wouldn't own it anymore.

12:32.452 --> 12:36.589
Calvin, that's how selling
something usually works.

12:36.689 --> 12:39.326
Tina, I've put my heart and soul

12:39.426 --> 12:41.028
into that place
for over 30 years.

12:41.128 --> 12:44.597
And I put my heart
and soul into it, too.

12:46.099 --> 12:49.102
I have never dreamed
of selling.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.840
But, baby, I do
the books. And...

12:52.840 --> 12:55.342
I did some calculations.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.445
And do you know how long
it'd take us to make

12:58.545 --> 12:59.847
what they're offering?

12:59.847 --> 13:00.981
Guess.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.016
Mm-mmm. No.
I know how this works.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.985
How long?

13:06.887 --> 13:08.288
Never.

13:09.857 --> 13:13.226
Who knows if an offer like
this will ever come again?

13:14.594 --> 13:15.662
Tina...

13:15.762 --> 13:17.865
if I'm not Calvin
of Calvin's Pit Stop,

13:17.865 --> 13:20.733
then who the hell am I?

13:20.868 --> 13:23.036
You're Calvin the father.

13:23.971 --> 13:26.306
Calvin the Yardecue King.

13:27.274 --> 13:31.078
Calvin, the man that
I fell in love with.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.183
Baby, that shop
doesn't define you.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.585
You define that shop.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.092
Yeah, I guess
there's more to the world

13:45.192 --> 13:47.961
than motor oil
and transmissions.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.331
Truth of the matter is
I passed my daddy

13:51.431 --> 13:53.466
in tire rotations in 2014.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.573
Baby, remember
when we got married?

14:00.673 --> 14:04.912
we said that we were gonna
make love on every continent.

14:04.912 --> 14:07.547
We're still just on one.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.750
We went to Mexico.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.220
That's the same continent.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.189
We needed a passport.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.161
Don't we deserve
to do the things

14:21.261 --> 14:23.296
that we've always
dreamed about?

14:24.331 --> 14:25.698
You're right.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.937
You're my sweet girl and I...
I want us to both be happy,

14:29.937 --> 14:31.371
so...

14:32.272 --> 14:33.806
You know what?

14:34.774 --> 14:37.277
Let's do it. Let's do it.

14:40.613 --> 14:43.316
You won't regret it.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.517
It's our time.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.853
Yes, it is.

14:46.954 --> 14:49.189
But you know we can't really
afford a yacht, though, right?

14:49.289 --> 14:50.790
Aw...

14:50.958 --> 14:52.659
But maybe...

14:52.759 --> 14:55.495
you can get naked on
one of them big blow-up ducks.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.431
Mm-hmm? You know
what I'm talking about?
Quack.

14:58.531 --> 15:01.001
Quack, quack, quack!
Quack, quack!

15:04.671 --> 15:06.473
whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Whoa.

15:06.573 --> 15:07.807
Guys, I need your help.
Oh!

15:07.975 --> 15:09.209
I'm spinning out,
I know it's crazy,

15:09.309 --> 15:10.810
but I can't help it.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.613
Wait, is this about
Gemma's jersey?

15:13.713 --> 15:15.682
Oh, my God, did you have
a dream about it, too?

15:15.782 --> 15:17.017
No.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.986
I could see your face
when you found out about it.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.988
Dave, I thought you were
more evolved than this.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.856
Well, it was easy to be evolved
when it was Marty's problem,

15:23.991 --> 15:25.358
but now it's mine.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.529
Hate that jersey.
I want to strangle that jersey.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.731
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:31.831 --> 15:34.434
Dave, look, you and Gemma
have a happy, secure marriage.

15:34.534 --> 15:35.802
You can't possibly think...

15:35.902 --> 15:37.404
Oh, shut up, Malcolm!

15:40.407 --> 15:42.309
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.011
I should not have
snapped at you like that.

15:44.011 --> 15:45.312
You're not Brian.

15:45.412 --> 15:46.813
And what's so great
about Brian anyway?

15:46.913 --> 15:49.016
She brought that jersey from
high school to college,

15:49.116 --> 15:51.018
all the way out
to California with her.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.886
She wouldn't even let me
bring my karaoke machine.

15:54.021 --> 15:56.023
We need to thank her
for that one.

15:58.091 --> 16:01.428
Look, Dave, you just need to
tell Gemma how you really feel.

16:01.528 --> 16:02.695
Yeah, but she'll just say

16:02.795 --> 16:03.930
that I'm being
totally irrational.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.465
Yes, just like you told me

16:05.565 --> 16:08.268
I was being totally irrational,
and you were right.

16:08.368 --> 16:09.602
Exactly.

16:09.702 --> 16:10.937
It's not like
Gemma's gonna leave you

16:11.038 --> 16:12.539
for some guy she dated
in high school.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.407
She's your wife, Dave.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.844
All right.
You're right.

16:17.944 --> 16:21.048
Okay. Think it's obvious
what I have to do.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.415
Talk to Gemma. No.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.351
Find Brian, find out
who he's married to

16:24.451 --> 16:26.053
and make her wear my clothes.

16:27.920 --> 16:28.921
No?

16:29.056 --> 16:31.091
Okay, fine.
I'll go talk to her.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.959
Yes.

16:36.763 --> 16:37.797
No.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.702
Uh, Gemma,
I have something to say,

16:42.802 --> 16:44.804
so I'm just going to say it.

16:44.904 --> 16:48.375
I know you think of me
as being an evolved man,

16:48.475 --> 16:49.709
and I pride myself on that.

16:49.809 --> 16:52.145
However, that
jersey triggers

16:52.245 --> 16:53.380
an irrational but nevertheless

16:53.480 --> 16:54.847
emotionally valid
reaction in me.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.783
I ask that you respect me
and our marriage

16:56.883 --> 16:58.085
and remove it from our home.

16:58.085 --> 16:59.786
Thank you very much.
There, I said it.

17:01.588 --> 17:04.824
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
Did you say something?

17:04.924 --> 17:06.226
Oh, damn it!

17:07.827 --> 17:09.096
Okay, Gemma, I have
something to say,

17:09.196 --> 17:10.363
so I'm just gonna say it.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.531
I know you think of me
as being...

17:11.631 --> 17:12.865
Oh, what am I even doing?

17:15.268 --> 17:17.837
I-I hate this jersey.

17:17.937 --> 17:20.307
What?
You said it didn't bother you.

17:20.407 --> 17:21.641
Well, I was lying.

17:21.741 --> 17:22.975
I didn't know I was lying,
but I was lying.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.878
Not only do I not
want you to wear it,

17:25.978 --> 17:28.281
I want to rip it into a million
pieces with my bare hands.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.916
And I know I'm probably
not strong enough,

17:30.016 --> 17:32.752
but adrenaline
does crazy things.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.558
Dave, it's just
a comfortable, old jersey.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.127
It doesn't mean anything.

17:40.127 --> 17:44.131
I know. And I know that
I'm being petty and irrational.

17:44.131 --> 17:45.932
But...

17:46.032 --> 17:47.434
I can't look at that jersey

17:47.534 --> 17:49.969
without thinking about
you and Brian.

17:51.138 --> 17:54.741
I don't want to think about you
with anyone other than me.

17:54.841 --> 17:58.145
That's actually
kind of attractive.

17:58.145 --> 17:59.746
What is?

17:59.846 --> 18:03.250
This primal caveman
side of you.

18:03.350 --> 18:07.754
It's so dumb, but...
it's kind of hot.

18:12.992 --> 18:15.428
Well, in that case...

18:15.528 --> 18:17.164
Yabba-Dabba-Doo.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.199
And no longer hot.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.337
This is so exciting.
Uh, Tina,

18:24.437 --> 18:27.307
remind me to get a display case
for this pen.

18:27.407 --> 18:30.877
It's what they did for Barack
when he signed Obamacare.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.645
I wish you would
have told me that.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.581
I would have found you a
pen with no teeth marks.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.751
Yeah, and...

18:38.851 --> 18:40.620
boom!

18:40.720 --> 18:41.988
And boom.

18:42.088 --> 18:44.624
What did you do?
I just ordered a bag.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.594
Congratulations, Calvin.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.028
The Pit Stop
is in great hands.

18:49.196 --> 18:52.232
And your check is in my hands.

18:53.533 --> 18:54.934
All right, let's celebrate.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.770
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

19:03.075 --> 19:05.345
A toast to Mom and Dad

19:05.445 --> 19:07.013
and to Calvin's Pit Stop.

19:07.113 --> 19:08.448
May we all take our cars there

19:08.548 --> 19:09.916
before we have to pay
the new guys to service them.

19:12.018 --> 19:13.119
I will drink to that.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.788
And to the love of my life,

19:15.888 --> 19:17.224
the fearless Calvin Butler,

19:17.224 --> 19:20.460
who I'm so excited
to start this next chapter with.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.496
And to Tina Butler,
my ride or die. Aw.

19:23.596 --> 19:26.098
I couldn't have done
this without you, babe.
I love you, baby.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.667
Thank you.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.302
And boom.

19:29.402 --> 19:32.305
Uh, another boom?
Yeah, I just bought a Rolex.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.507
Hey, babe, now, we can't
be spending money like...

19:34.607 --> 19:37.444
For you.
Oh. Well, all right.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.849
You know, I would say,
"Come back soon,"

19:42.949 --> 19:46.253
but once you walk out that door,
I'm locking up for good.

19:47.153 --> 19:48.255
Now, you sure you don't want me

19:48.255 --> 19:49.856
to rebuild your engine
or something?

19:49.956 --> 19:52.091
Might take a
couple of weeks, but... Calvin.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.526
It's time.

19:53.626 --> 19:56.128
Okay, yeah, sure.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.897
Here you go.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.933
Let go of the keys, Calvin.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.172
Bye, Lil Hatchet.

20:06.939 --> 20:09.776
All right. So...

20:09.876 --> 20:12.345
let's-let's get out of here. Mm.

20:14.146 --> 20:16.549
Hey, you know what, uh...

20:16.649 --> 20:17.750
why don't you go ahead.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.719
You need a moment?

20:19.819 --> 20:21.254
Yeah.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.922
Okay.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.503
Yeah.

20:41.308 --> 20:43.943
Oh.
I'm taking my cord, though.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.554
Oh, well.
That's they problem now.
