00:03.000 --> 00:05.220
Nikolai. William's brother.

00:05.220 --> 00:07.800
She's not my girlfriend
and she's leaving now.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.320
I need some space!

00:10.500 --> 00:14.440
I can't think properly
when I'm with you.

00:14.520 --> 00:17.980
If nothing feels more important
to you than being with William...

00:18.080 --> 00:21.040
You have to try to make it work.

00:21.300 --> 00:23.740
Hi. Noora, wasn't it?

00:23.800 --> 00:28.000
Some girls believe he's good deep down.
They believe he's going to be better for them.

00:29.320 --> 00:33.920
You're standing here, while he's out there
somewhere sleeping with someone else.

02:05.300 --> 02:15.340
<i>[Fuck I lost my phone between the bus seats yesterday, and
only found it today. I'm in Lillehammer but it's shit and I miss
you so much. Can we please be done with the space stuff soon?]</i>

02:15.400 --> 02:18.440
<i>[Love you.]</i>

02:40.300 --> 02:42.300
[Alcohol poisoning]

02:48.620 --> 02:51.700
[Drugged?]

03:22.080 --> 03:27.960
[Rape and sexual assault]

04:36.380 --> 04:45.040
<i>[Hi. What happened on Friday?
I don't remember anything.]</i>

04:54.760 --> 05:02.420
<i>[Hi. What happened on Friday?
I blacked out.]</i>

05:16.960 --> 05:20.180
What's up? Have you locked your door?
-What is it?

05:20.840 --> 05:22.480
William's outside.

05:27.820 --> 05:33.000
Say that I'm not home.
-That'd be weird since I already said you're home.

05:41.020 --> 05:46.620
Say that I'm sleeping or something.
Or that I'm sick.

05:46.800 --> 05:51.940
He's really insistent. Can't you
just go out and talk to him?

05:52.080 --> 05:56.780
Can't you just find an excuse, Eskild?

05:58.140 --> 05:59.000
Okay.

06:04.040 --> 06:06.660
Are you ok, or?
-Eskild! I...

06:07.740 --> 06:10.760
I just want to be alone, okay?

06:10.840 --> 06:15.160
Is that impossible for you to understand?

06:19.280 --> 06:20.540
Okay, that's fine.

06:45.720 --> 06:48.380
Noora. Noora!
Two seconds.

06:48.380 --> 06:54.980
I have a friend who's a journalist at Aftenposten.
They want an article from a young voice.

06:54.980 --> 06:59.660
I showed him the article
you wrote last week.

06:59.660 --> 07:04.820
He liked it a lot. I suggested
you could write the article.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.100
Isn't that cool?

07:08.240 --> 07:15.520
Yeah... I'm just not sure I can.
If I have time now.

07:16.020 --> 07:20.480
There's a week left. Don't you want
to become a journalist? You have to do this.

07:21.640 --> 07:26.300
Yeah, okay. I can try.
-Cool. I'll e-mail you then.

07:36.460 --> 07:38.260
You tried to call me on Friday?

07:44.560 --> 07:46.220
Wrong number.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.900
Six times?

08:00.140 --> 08:01.140
What's going on?

08:10.120 --> 08:12.420
What's going on is that...

08:13.780 --> 08:19.780
I said I want some space!
I asked for it, you have to give me space.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.880
Whose locker is this?

08:57.480 --> 08:58.900
Sana's.

09:01.180 --> 09:02.820
What does it mean?

09:04.480 --> 09:05.520
Whore.

09:07.620 --> 09:09.460
Fucking hijab police.

09:13.540 --> 09:17.480
They want war,
they'll get war.

09:50.700 --> 09:55.960
Hello sunshine. What's up?
-I'll just have some food.

10:04.060 --> 10:05.960
Should we go see Paradise afterwards?

10:18.420 --> 10:20.520
Was it you who took my fishcakes?

10:22.120 --> 10:24.160
Were those your fishcakes?

10:25.260 --> 10:27.220
For fuck's sake, Eskild.

10:28.500 --> 10:32.440
I can buy new ones in the morning.
I get my salary tomorrow.

10:33.760 --> 10:38.560
I don't need fishcakes tomorrow,
I need fishcakes now!

10:39.000 --> 10:42.460
I would've eaten two
fishcakes at five!

10:43.320 --> 10:45.620
Now I don't have
anything to eat.

10:48.680 --> 10:52.180
I can make something else
that's nice for you...

10:54.920 --> 10:57.820
You can't make something else!

10:58.600 --> 11:01.480
You can't even cook, Eskild!

11:02.700 --> 11:07.560
The only thing you can do... You can't do shit
other than benefiting from other people!

11:14.920 --> 11:15.820
She's kind of right.

11:17.660 --> 11:19.640
What the fuck, Linn?
Are you serious?

11:21.860 --> 11:23.280
Oh my god.

11:31.640 --> 11:34.120
How did the talk
with William go?

11:35.600 --> 11:41.700
I dropped it. I don't think
we fit really well together.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.220
What happened?

11:47.840 --> 11:55.220
We logged into my brother's computer, copied all
the kinky messages with Jamilah, and posted it on his wall.

11:55.920 --> 11:56.960
Are you joking?

11:58.860 --> 12:01.220
What did she say?
-She hasn't said anything.

12:26.340 --> 12:28.380
Did you bring me lunch today?

12:30.100 --> 12:33.800
No, I forgot.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.880
Want to borrow some
money to buy something?

12:41.920 --> 12:42.880
No, no. I'm fine.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.500
Hey, Sana?
-What?

12:49.560 --> 12:52.220
I think we really got ourselves into shit now.

12:52.640 --> 12:53.440
What is it?

12:55.200 --> 13:00.960
Allah9753 commented on a Riot picture:
"Good click yesterday, guys."

13:02.640 --> 13:04.100
What does that mean?

13:06.480 --> 13:10.700
It means the hijab
police is not behind the hate account.

13:17.780 --> 13:19.680
I'm sure it's one
of the Riot guys.

13:22.620 --> 13:25.320
Fuck, it's the asshole
from the bus party.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.700
Eh, Sana?

13:34.920 --> 13:39.320
Oh no.
-They're coming this way.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.560
What do we do?
-Honestly, run!

13:43.960 --> 13:45.140
Huh?
-Run!

14:43.140 --> 14:52.700
<i>[Hi Noora. Didn't see your message til now. Nice to hear from you.
Don't worry. Absolutely nothing happened. Just a party. Nikko.]</i>

15:02.480 --> 15:03.940
William, we have to go.

15:04.680 --> 15:06.880
William! We have to pick
up the bus in 30 minutes.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.740
What's going on?

15:56.980 --> 15:58.720
We have to talk.

16:01.540 --> 16:03.080
I have to talk.

16:14.100 --> 16:18.160
I know I shouldn't have smashed that
bottle on the Yakuza guy's head.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.900
But there isn't anything
we can do about that now, okay?

16:24.460 --> 16:30.260
He has terrorised half of Oslo
and beat up innocent people.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.120
Including my best friend.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.960
I'm just really angry and
frustrated that they were beaten up.

16:41.220 --> 16:45.180
It was me who Yakuza was really after.
It's me they were going to take.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.540
Chris and the guys are the
only ones who have been there for me.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.600
Because I don't even
really have any family.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.220
You don't?

17:03.960 --> 17:09.720
Dad's a workaholic and mom's going
around taking valium with wine.

17:11.920 --> 17:14.380
My brother is a complete psychopath.

17:18.420 --> 17:19.980
Psychopath?

17:23.760 --> 17:26.220
He's just really manipulative.

17:27.800 --> 17:33.700
That's why I was such an
asshole that morning. In the kitchen.

17:37.460 --> 17:40.000
Had he found out
that I have feelings for you...

17:43.500 --> 17:45.160
He would have
tried to fuck it up.

17:50.040 --> 17:51.380
That's just how he is.

17:54.060 --> 17:59.320
He doesn't tolerate that
others can have something he doesn't.

18:04.920 --> 18:08.100
I've taken a lot of shit from Nico.

18:10.920 --> 18:15.960
That's because he's the only brother I have.
He's pretty much the only family I have.

18:22.120 --> 18:24.540
But if he had tried to
fuck it up between the two of us...

18:27.640 --> 18:28.960
... I would've killed him.

18:34.760 --> 18:35.940
I would've killed him.

18:52.060 --> 18:53.580
I have to be with you.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.540
Say that we should be together.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.320
Don't be so sad.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.860
Fucking hell William,
we have to go.

19:43.680 --> 19:44.860
I love you.

20:08.600 --> 20:19.160
<i>[No way! Fucked up! Just found this picture on my phone,
and then remembered EVERYTHING! You were so horny.
Haha! You behaved like a little whore.]</i>
