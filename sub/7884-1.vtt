00:02.702 --> 00:04.727
Come on, life sounds. Let's go.
- Okay.

00:04.904 --> 00:07.202
Mike down, mike down.
There you go, now go.

00:07.374 --> 00:09.239
You'd think I'd never done this.
Ready?

00:09.409 --> 00:11.843
Hey, wait a second. Ready.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.877
Five, four, three....

00:14.514 --> 00:15.811
Hi, I'm Angela Vidal.

00:15.982 --> 00:19.145
Come with us tonight
as we travel along with--...

00:21.221 --> 00:22.313
Sorry.
- Okay.

00:22.489 --> 00:24.047
Ready?
- Yeah, wait a second.

00:24.224 --> 00:26.021
You got a little hair thing. Hold on.

00:26.192 --> 00:28.183
Let me get that.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.022
That right there.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.994
Okay, there we go.
- Thank you.

00:33.166 --> 00:34.656
Okay.

00:37.437 --> 00:38.904
Hold on.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.770
Okay. Ready.

00:42.942 --> 00:44.273
Hi, I'm Angela Vidal.

00:44.444 --> 00:48.574
Come with us tonight as we paint
the town red on The Night Shift.

00:49.849 --> 00:52.010
Sorry, a little off my A-game.
I'll get there.

00:52.185 --> 00:55.518
That wasn't bad. The second part
just seemed a little pushed, though.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.690
On tonight's Night Shift,
we're in Los Angeles...

00:58.858 --> 01:02.692
...traveling along with that special
breed of hero we like to call...

01:03.963 --> 01:06.056
...the fire department.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074

01:22.415 --> 01:25.384
We should have come earlier.
We could be going with them.

01:28.254 --> 01:29.721
Well, that's cool. You got it?

01:29.889 --> 01:33.381
Yeah, that's great. That was perfect.
- We'll wait for them to get back.

01:33.593 --> 01:35.561
You prefer Bob or Robert--?
- Bob's good.

01:35.728 --> 01:37.593
Bob, okay, sorry. Ready? Okay.
- Yeah.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.164
Three, two, one.

01:40.366 --> 01:43.597
Tell us, Bob, what's a normal night
here at the station?

01:43.770 --> 01:45.499
This might surprise most people...

01:45.672 --> 01:48.402
...but 85 percent of the calls
we go out on are medical.

01:48.575 --> 01:51.510
It can be anything from chest pain
to more serious things.

01:51.678 --> 01:54.476
How do you handle that
with ambulances and hospitals?

01:54.647 --> 01:57.081
Most ambulances you see
are fire department.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.081
I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

01:59.252 --> 02:01.812
And most firefighters
are also paramedics.

02:01.988 --> 02:04.456
At least,
that's the direction it's going.

02:04.624 --> 02:07.525
One more question, something
I'm sure we're all wondering:

02:07.694 --> 02:11.425
Do firefighters still slide down
those fabulous poles?

02:11.598 --> 02:13.327
We sure do.

02:13.533 --> 02:14.795
No turning back.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.493
Tell my mom I loved her.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.837
See?
- That's not so bad.

02:22.008 --> 02:25.136
I'm glad I didn't wear a skirt.
That could really hurt your legs.

02:25.311 --> 02:28.803
Tell me, Bob, how do you get down
when you're wearing a skirt?

02:29.182 --> 02:31.047
Pantyhose help.

02:31.651 --> 02:32.709
Pantyhose.

02:32.919 --> 02:35.547
That's what they wear under their,
what, their turnouts.

02:35.722 --> 02:36.814
Exactly.
- Pantyhose.

02:36.990 --> 02:40.448
Fire-retardant pantyhose.
- You heard it here.

02:40.627 --> 02:42.219
Can I do it one more time?
- Sure.

02:42.428 --> 02:43.986
I'll be right back, okay?

02:44.197 --> 02:46.324
We're going to the dining hall.
- All right.

02:46.499 --> 02:49.662
Couple of guys I want you to meet.
- Cool.

02:56.809 --> 02:58.800
Hey.

03:01.381 --> 03:02.473
This is Jake.
- Hey.

03:02.649 --> 03:03.707
And Fletcher.
- Hi.

03:03.883 --> 03:04.975
Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

03:05.151 --> 03:08.211
These are the men you'll be
shadowing. Wherever they go, you go.

03:08.388 --> 03:11.380
Cool. Please, oh, please, finish eating.
We'll talk after.

03:11.558 --> 03:13.185
Well, would you like some?
- Yeah.

03:13.359 --> 03:14.690
Did you make it?
- We got--

03:14.861 --> 03:16.260
I didn't make it.

03:16.462 --> 03:17.895
Firemen are really good cooks.

03:18.064 --> 03:19.725
Yeah, that's what I hear.
- Exactly.

03:19.899 --> 03:22.333
You should try some of the food.
- Yeah, I'm game.

03:22.502 --> 03:24.902
Please finish eating.
- We'll get you a plate.

03:25.071 --> 03:27.198
Great. Sounds great.

03:27.907 --> 03:30.432
Just maybe un-tuck your shirt
and stick it up here.

03:30.610 --> 03:33.044
Okay. Okay.
- Clip it on your collar.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.209
You filming this?
- Yeah.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.181
Elliot's been telling me
I never give him enough B-roll...

03:40.353 --> 03:42.116
...so I'm just gonna shoot it all.

03:43.122 --> 03:44.749
Jake? Jake?
- Yeah, yeah.

03:44.924 --> 03:47.552
If you could keep
from rubbing into the mike too much--...

03:47.727 --> 03:49.786
Sorry, yeah.
- Don't worry about the camera.

03:49.996 --> 03:51.623
Pretend it's not even there.
- Okay.

03:51.798 --> 03:53.925
Can you say something?
Give me a level?

03:54.100 --> 03:55.965
Yeah. Mike check, one--

03:56.135 --> 03:58.626
You can just pretend it's not there.
Just talk free.

03:58.805 --> 04:01.239
Can you say something
more compelling?

04:02.575 --> 04:04.042
I don't know what to say--

04:04.210 --> 04:06.770
I mean, am I gonna have
this thing on all the time?

04:06.946 --> 04:10.040
Yeah, just watch what you say.
We'll hear everything.

04:10.216 --> 04:11.649
Shit.

04:12.118 --> 04:14.609
You're probably not allowed
to swear on your station.

04:14.787 --> 04:16.584
No. We can cut most of it out.

04:16.755 --> 04:18.815
But it helps
if you're not dropping F-bombs.

04:19.024 --> 04:21.653
Point noted. Filed right here.

04:22.228 --> 04:24.788
So if I was to call this guy
an ass-monkey...

04:24.964 --> 04:28.024
...that would be considered
a swear too, right?

04:29.335 --> 04:31.235
It's gonna be a long night.

04:31.437 --> 04:32.495
So this thing?
- Yeah?

04:32.672 --> 04:36.335
Is this some sort of torture device
when you don't get in your turnouts?

04:36.542 --> 04:38.271
That's what it is.
- Can you get it?

04:38.444 --> 04:40.105
Yes. This is called a hook ladder.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.748
We use this in the--
The firemen would use this--...

04:42.915 --> 04:44.473
We should bring it down?
- Yes.

04:44.651 --> 04:45.743
Okay.
- All right.

04:45.918 --> 04:46.976
Can you grab the hook?

04:47.153 --> 04:49.144
So this was used
in the '20s and the '30s.

04:49.322 --> 04:51.415
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.183
And as you can see...

04:53.359 --> 04:56.192
...these are the rungs,
and the hook at the end...

04:56.362 --> 05:01.163
...they would grasp onto one window
and then pull themselves up.

05:01.334 --> 05:05.168
And then when they got to that
windowsill, they would hook it again.

05:05.338 --> 05:07.033
And then pull themselves up.
- Okay.

05:07.206 --> 05:09.197
Did you get the hook, Scott?
You see this?

05:09.375 --> 05:12.105
Used in the '20s and '30s.
They stopped using it around--...

05:12.278 --> 05:14.212
Hold it up higher.
- Replaced it--...

05:14.380 --> 05:15.642
That's good, right?
- Good.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.045
Replaced it
with a regular ladder that extends?

05:18.217 --> 05:19.707
Yeah, and rope.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.319
They must have tiny feet.
Those are little rungs.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.821
Yeah. Firemen
were a lot smaller back then.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.859
The fires were bigger
and they were smaller.

05:30.029 --> 05:33.933
Don't tell captain we took this down.
- I'm not gonna tell him I touched it.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.965
I wanna introduce you to somebody.
This is Wilshire. Mark.

05:37.136 --> 05:38.330
Good boy.
- Hey, Wilshire.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.369
Say hi.
- Dog right out of the cartoons.

05:40.540 --> 05:43.509
Well, there's a reason
why the Dalmatians were in cartoons.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.144
The fire department
has a great sense of tradition.

05:46.312 --> 05:47.370
Yeah, we do.

05:47.547 --> 05:49.344
Dalmatians
got along well with horses.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.915
Important when the fire trucks
were horse-drawn.

05:52.118 --> 05:53.517
Now they're used as mascots.

05:53.686 --> 05:56.849
But what they're trained to do
is run in and stop the traffic.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.923
Kind of like Fletch.
- Yeah.

05:59.125 --> 06:02.583
That's what I do, I run out there.
Sort of like what a siren does today.

06:02.762 --> 06:06.698
Okay, well, Wilshire can show you
what to do in case you catch on fire.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.390
Stop, drop and roll.
- Yeah.

06:08.568 --> 06:11.059
So let's just pretend
you're 5 years old and on fire.

06:11.237 --> 06:13.330
I'm on fire.
- Wilshire's gonna teach you.

06:13.506 --> 06:15.064
Tell me what to do.

06:15.241 --> 06:17.232
Okay. Wilshire.

06:18.010 --> 06:21.036
Wilshire, mark. Stay.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.511
Wilshire, drop.

06:22.682 --> 06:24.707
Drop. Drop.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.875
Wilshire, roll.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.111
Wilshire, roll.

06:28.287 --> 06:29.618
Good.
- Look at that.

06:29.789 --> 06:32.121
Good boy. Good boy.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.657
I'm gonna live.
- Report.

06:35.094 --> 06:36.584
You're not gonna be on fire.

06:36.763 --> 06:40.529
So it's stop, drop and roll,
in case you catch on fire. Wilshire.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.896
Yeah, you know, have some fun.
- You all hang out a lot?

06:44.070 --> 06:45.697
Yeah.
- You kind of live together.

06:45.872 --> 06:48.238
Yeah, we definitely live together.
Close quarters.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.636
Okay, good.
- Oh, ready?

06:49.809 --> 06:52.471
So yeah, we have 48-hour shifts...

06:52.678 --> 06:54.976
...so we have everything
we need in this place...

06:55.181 --> 06:58.241
...from, you know,
a small gym to this handball court.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.283
I'll show it to you.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.822
It's nice, right?
- Yeah.

07:07.293 --> 07:09.420
Sir, you got a call on the office line.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.620
Can you pick up a call
on the office line?

07:11.798 --> 07:12.992
Non-responder.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.291
Oh, shoot.
- Yeah.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.230
I was hoping we'd get a call.
- Yeah.

07:16.402 --> 07:18.893
Not a big one, a little call
so we can see action.

07:19.071 --> 07:20.265
Exciting, I guess.
- Yeah.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.670
Gotta be annoying
when trying to finish a game.

07:22.842 --> 07:23.934
Not if you're losing.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.476
Every time, you know,
we go respond to a call...

07:26.646 --> 07:28.136
...the points reset.

07:28.314 --> 07:30.839
Depending on which side you're on,
it's sort of nice.

07:31.017 --> 07:32.917
Works in your favor
from time to time?

07:33.085 --> 07:35.246
Not in my favor.
What are you talking about?

07:35.421 --> 07:36.752
I never lose.

07:36.923 --> 07:39.448
I think I'd roller-skate
if I had access to this.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.924
I can see you doing that. Yeah.

07:43.129 --> 07:46.121
Okay, so this is where the men
store their boots and turnouts.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.199
The pole hole is over here.

07:49.602 --> 07:52.765
The pole hole.
- Yeah, interesting name, I know.

07:52.939 --> 07:54.702
You got the locker room here.
- Yep.

07:54.874 --> 07:56.000
You got the dorms here.

07:56.175 --> 07:58.166
Our viewers
always like to see action...

07:58.344 --> 08:00.539
...so maybe we should go
into the locker room.

08:00.746 --> 08:02.873
Let's go in the locker room.
- You got it.

08:03.850 --> 08:06.683
Right this way.
- I was kidding, I was kidding.

08:06.853 --> 08:09.014
Okay, towel up, guys.
We got a female on deck.

08:09.188 --> 08:11.884
Female on the deck.
- Oh, my God.

08:12.058 --> 08:14.049
That's Griffin.
He can't sing very well.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.319
He's got one major talent,
so come this way.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.896
He's got a huge talent.
- We're not using this.

08:19.065 --> 08:22.728
Here. We have different hoses at
the station, and this is the Griffin hose.

08:22.902 --> 08:25.200
Griffin hose.
- What the hell?

08:25.371 --> 08:27.362
You know,
I hope that's a wide-angle lens.

08:27.540 --> 08:29.235
Oh, my God.

08:29.408 --> 08:30.500
Stay in there.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.667
Hey, put that thing away.

08:32.845 --> 08:35.837
This is adding a whole new meaning
to the term fireman's hose.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.414
Hey, hit the floor.
- Oh, my--

08:37.582 --> 08:39.551
I understand
why there are no women here.

08:39.719 --> 08:42.051
Plenty of female firefighters.
- ln this station?

08:42.221 --> 08:43.482
No, not currently.

08:43.655 --> 08:46.216
Okay, I think I can be a firefighter.

08:46.392 --> 08:49.520
Yeah, it's a lot harder than it seems.
- Keep the door closed.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.856
You know what?
Pick something you're good at.

08:52.031 --> 08:55.023
I bet you $1 0 I can do it better.
You all can be my witnesses.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.862
That's too easy. Ten bucks?
- Yeah.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.594
How about my place?

08:58.804 --> 09:01.238
I think we're done here.
We got everything we need.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.907
Here we go. Listen up.

09:03.075 --> 09:05.043
Did you know
you were gonna be on camera?

09:05.244 --> 09:07.007
Behind the line. Ready?
- Yeah.

09:07.179 --> 09:08.908
Ten bucks.
- You can't be in the way.

09:09.081 --> 09:10.605
I know.
- Get on that side.

09:10.816 --> 09:12.545
I'm just saying. You guys ready?

09:12.718 --> 09:14.379
You know what you're doing?
- Yes.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.919
And go.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.585
Get in there.
- That's not nice.

09:19.759 --> 09:21.693
That's not fair. She pushed.

09:21.861 --> 09:24.853
She pushed.
- Haven't got that much time.

09:26.966 --> 09:29.901
Yes. You owe her 1 0 bucks, man.
- Ten dollars.

09:30.069 --> 09:32.128
Pay up. Oh, that's embarrassing.

09:32.338 --> 09:35.136
Oh, this is embarrassing.
- That's really embarrassing.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.732
Okay, rolling.

09:39.779 --> 09:42.213
Just waiting
on something to happen.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.442
You wanna go back outside?
See what they're up to?

09:46.619 --> 09:48.143
Why not?

09:50.456 --> 09:52.890
Careful.
- Thank you.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.120
We're good.

10:03.369 --> 10:04.427
You good?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.731
I think they're talking about you.

10:06.906 --> 10:08.396
Will you turn up his mike?

10:08.574 --> 10:11.509
You didn't catch no eye.
Here, give me some of that.

10:11.978 --> 10:14.310
I'll tell you, all right?

10:15.281 --> 10:18.409
A hundred bucks
says I can bang her by the morning.

10:18.584 --> 10:21.075
Oh, come on.
- I'll take that bet.

10:21.253 --> 10:22.515
You're so busted.

10:22.688 --> 10:24.781
Nice mike.

10:29.996 --> 10:31.827
Missed a spot.

10:32.531 --> 10:35.989
Sorry, what?
- I said you missed a spot.

10:36.802 --> 10:40.101
Oh, I know how to hit the spot.
Don't you worry about that.

10:40.272 --> 10:44.675
I'll hold your camera.
You go kick his ass, okay?

10:52.451 --> 10:53.975
That's how you do pick and roll.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.677
Oh, yeah? Is that how you do it?

10:55.855 --> 10:58.119
He'll show you how to do it later.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.982
It's nighttime here...

11:01.160 --> 11:04.323
...and the firefighters take turns
sleeping in these rooms here.

11:04.497 --> 11:08.661
But if the alarm rings, they can be up
and on the truck in under one minute.

11:09.969 --> 11:12.028
Let's check out the room.

11:13.539 --> 11:15.131
Can you get in here?

11:16.976 --> 11:19.877
It's like my college dorm
without the pink.

11:21.480 --> 11:25.883
Attention, 222 Truck 16.

11:26.052 --> 11:28.077
Watch your back.
- Hey.

11:28.254 --> 11:30.381
Looks like you got your call.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.818
Just try to keep up.
- You okay?

11:35.027 --> 11:37.757
We're going to the pole hole.
- Come on, come on.

11:38.764 --> 11:40.095
Got it?
- What you wanna do?

11:40.266 --> 11:41.893
I can't slide down there.

11:42.068 --> 11:44.229
Come here, come here,
come this way.

11:44.904 --> 11:47.532
Careful, okay?
We have to get on that truck.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.572
There are like 1 5 stairs.
- I got it.

11:49.742 --> 11:51.767
You be careful.
- Keep going, keep going.

11:51.977 --> 11:53.842
It's this way?
- Yeah. Yeah, keep going.

11:54.013 --> 11:55.708
Be careful.
- Make a quick right.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.111
Make a quick right, baby.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.988
Just jump in the back.

12:10.429 --> 12:11.794
Jump in.
- Buckle up.

12:11.997 --> 12:13.430
We're almost in.
- You guys in?

12:13.599 --> 12:15.692
Yep, yep, yep.
- Yep?

12:15.868 --> 12:18.496
Nice job.

12:26.512 --> 12:27.877
What kind of call is this?

12:28.047 --> 12:29.378
Probably just a medical.

12:29.548 --> 12:31.641
Okay.
- We'll find out when we get there.

12:31.817 --> 12:33.910
You seem to have kept shooting.

12:36.122 --> 12:37.589
Ready?

12:38.157 --> 12:40.387
Ready, set. Ready, set.

12:41.794 --> 12:43.887
Okay, good.

12:44.063 --> 12:48.159
Most little girls wanna be ballerinas
or princesses when they grow up.

12:48.334 --> 12:51.735
I used to tell my mom, 'Someday,
I'm gonna grow up and be a fireman.'

12:51.904 --> 12:54.668
Tonight, I am truly living the dream.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.400
It's so loud,
I don't think we can use any of it.

12:57.576 --> 13:00.272
Scott, I am still living the dream.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.110
Thirty-seventeen, go ahead.

13:14.193 --> 13:16.991
All right, we got a eight at 3 o'clock.

13:17.163 --> 13:20.030
Keep calling out numbers.
What are you doing?

13:20.199 --> 13:21.689
Well, Jake's the engineer.

13:21.867 --> 13:24.301
He's actually
a third-generation engineer...

13:24.470 --> 13:26.597
...but I have the most important job.

13:26.772 --> 13:27.830
Navigating?

13:28.007 --> 13:30.669
No,
I'm in charge of the chick-o-meter.

13:30.843 --> 13:32.470
When I see a girl, I rate them.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.637
So if I say
there's a eight at 3 o'clock...

13:35.815 --> 13:38.613
...the guys know
they better look to the right.

13:40.219 --> 13:43.780
You know, it's really funny. I always
thought firemen were so dignified.

13:43.956 --> 13:46.516
Oh, no, no.
I signed up for brave and courageous.

13:46.692 --> 13:50.822
I don't do dignified.
- Yeah, I think we get that by now.

13:53.132 --> 13:55.225
I see a nine at 2.

13:55.401 --> 13:57.699
Oh, we got a nine at 2.
- Yeah.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.862
Whoa, that's a dude.

14:01.807 --> 14:05.675
It's called a chick-o-meter,
not a dick-o-meter.

14:06.545 --> 14:08.035
I think we're good.

14:08.214 --> 14:11.250
You're fired. You can't talk anymore.

14:16.922 --> 14:19.152
So where do you think
the problem is?

14:19.325 --> 14:22.089
Do you think it's over there,
around the corner?

14:22.261 --> 14:23.660
Or maybe around there?

14:23.829 --> 14:25.228
You're rotten, you know that?

14:25.397 --> 14:28.366
To the core, baby. To the core.

14:39.645 --> 14:41.636
What are you taking with you?

14:42.014 --> 14:43.413
Tools.

14:43.582 --> 14:47.678
Really anything we might need
to break a lock or open a door.

14:48.153 --> 14:50.121
You're the one who called this in?
- Yeah.

14:50.289 --> 14:51.415
Come, follow me.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.217
Look at Probie's new turnouts.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.656
I didn't know
they made them that new.

14:56.695 --> 14:58.595
We're almost to the building.

14:58.764 --> 15:01.392
Police are here. Might be more
serious than we thought.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.159
Probably not.

15:13.712 --> 15:15.873
A woman was screaming
bloody murder up there.

15:16.048 --> 15:18.312
It's Mrs. Espinoza.
- Two cops are up there.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.543
When did they get here?
- Five minutes ago.

15:20.719 --> 15:22.983
What's that sound?
- Sound of the building.

15:23.188 --> 15:24.246
It's very old.

15:24.423 --> 15:27.085
He insists on fixing everything.
- Wanda, please.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.056
What apartment number?
- It's up here.

15:29.228 --> 15:31.594
Go back to your apartments.
- We heard screams.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.062
Well, at least get out of the way.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.497
Are they with you?
- Yeah. They're shadowing us.

15:36.702 --> 15:38.329
Then they're your responsibility.

15:38.504 --> 15:40.802
I tell you not to film something,
don't film it.

15:40.973 --> 15:43.498
I tell you to get lost, you get lost.
- No problem.

15:43.709 --> 15:47.338
Here on the second floor on the right.
It's an old woman, lives alone.

15:47.513 --> 15:50.311
Probably fell.
Neighbors heard screams, called it in.

15:50.482 --> 15:51.813
What are those people doing?

15:51.984 --> 15:54.646
You wouldn't believe
the way she screamed. It was crazy.

15:54.820 --> 15:57.311
Neighbors say she's weird.
Doesn't talk to anybody.

15:57.489 --> 15:58.649
She hasn't made a sound.

15:58.824 --> 16:00.451
Who are they?
- They're with Fire.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.618
I told them not to get in the way.
- Great. That's all we need.

16:09.969 --> 16:14.099
Hello, ma'am, can you hear me?
It's L.A.P.D.

16:14.273 --> 16:15.535
Ma'am, open up the door.

16:15.741 --> 16:18.767
I'm here with paramedics.
We're gonna come in to help you.

16:18.944 --> 16:22.141
If you're near the door,
I need you to move away from it.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.874
Hey, I got the keys.
- Then get in here, sir. Come on.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.278
2A.
- Help us out here.

16:26.452 --> 16:29.751
Just a second. Yeah, here we are.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.822
She must have added locks.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.293
I'm gonna do an intro.
- Yeah, you're good.

16:38.464 --> 16:42.025
Okay. We're standing
outside an elderly woman's apartment.

16:42.201 --> 16:44.294
Neighbors heard screams
and called 911.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.734
The fire department's
about to begin the rescue.

16:46.905 --> 16:50.534
Police say that she lives alone,
she's not very social--

16:53.012 --> 16:55.674
I need you to get back,
brother, please, this time.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.975
Ma'am, we're the police.

16:59.051 --> 17:00.575
We're here to help you.

17:00.786 --> 17:03.084
Ma'am? Ma'am?

17:03.288 --> 17:05.347
Ma'am, can you hear us?

17:06.157 --> 17:09.025
What's her name?
- Mrs. Espinoza.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.560
There's no need to worry, Mrs.
Espinoza. We're here to help you.

17:12.731 --> 17:14.425
Okay, ma'am.

17:16.001 --> 17:17.366
It's okay.
- It's all right.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.867
Everything's gonna be fine.

17:20.939 --> 17:22.667
Ma'am? We're right here, ma'am.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.900
It's okay.
- Ma'am.

17:27.913 --> 17:29.847
Jesus.
- Are you okay?

17:30.015 --> 17:31.539
You okay? Come here.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.207
Ma'am, it's-- We're the police.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.819
Ma'am.
- We're here to help you.

17:36.688 --> 17:41.250
It's all right, is there anybody else
in the apartment? Any more animals?

17:41.860 --> 17:43.794
It's gonna be okay, ma'am.
- All right.

17:43.962 --> 17:45.953
It's okay, all right?

17:46.131 --> 17:47.598
It's all right.

17:48.600 --> 17:49.692
Ma'am, ma'am.

17:49.868 --> 17:51.893
It's all right. It's all right.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.129
All right. Okay, okay.

17:53.338 --> 17:54.430
Okay, all right.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.597
All right. Are you hurt?

17:56.775 --> 17:58.743
All right, are you hurt?

17:58.911 --> 18:00.640
No.
- Okay, okay.

18:00.846 --> 18:02.746
We're gonna get you
some medical help.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.440
No, no, no. Please, don't.

18:05.617 --> 18:07.414
No, are you okay?
Are you okay, ma'am?

18:07.586 --> 18:10.749
No, no, no.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.084
Okay, okay, okay.

18:13.258 --> 18:16.250
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay, all right?

18:16.428 --> 18:18.760
Okay, just relax.
- Just relax.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.728
Just calm down.
- Just calm down.

18:20.899 --> 18:23.891
Turn that thing off.
- Turn that off.

18:24.069 --> 18:26.230
Give us some room.

18:26.738 --> 18:28.262
Come on, man.
- Gloves on, Danny.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.930
Where's that blood coming from?

18:30.109 --> 18:32.976
Hey, chief,
we're gonna need an ambulance here.

18:33.145 --> 18:34.305
Copy. On our way.

18:34.480 --> 18:37.449
Mrs. Espinoza,
it's all gonna be all right.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.949
All right,
I just need you to calm down, okay?

18:43.021 --> 18:45.012
It's all right.
Nobody's here to hurt you.

18:45.190 --> 18:47.283
We can't help you
unless you calm down.

18:47.459 --> 18:50.826
An ambulance is on its way right now.
- All right.

18:51.897 --> 18:53.330
Let's just clear a space.

18:53.499 --> 18:57.128
Danny, get everybody out of here
until the ambulance gets here.

19:03.108 --> 19:06.805
Get her off. Get off. Get her off.

19:09.848 --> 19:12.112
Get him on the floor.
Get him on the floor.

19:12.284 --> 19:14.445
No. We are not moving him.

19:14.620 --> 19:17.487
We are waiting for the ambulance.
- Do you see an ambulance?

19:17.656 --> 19:19.123
We have to get him downstairs.

19:19.291 --> 19:22.783
All right. Come on, come on. Okay.
- Grab the arm.

19:22.961 --> 19:24.485
Come on. Come on, I got it.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.824
Come on, lean down.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.626
I got her. I got her.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.233
Let's go.

19:30.435 --> 19:32.369
Get the fuck out of the way.
- Go, Scott.

19:32.538 --> 19:34.335
Move that camera.

19:34.506 --> 19:35.973
Come on, let's go, let's go.

19:36.141 --> 19:38.974
Did we get that?
- Move, move, move.

19:39.144 --> 19:41.408
Let's go, open that door.
- Let's go.

19:41.580 --> 19:44.208
Be careful down the stairs.
- Hang in there, buddy.

19:44.383 --> 19:46.578
Tape everything, you hear me?
Tape everything.

19:46.752 --> 19:49.016
Move. Move. Move.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.849
Open the door.
- It's locked.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.389
How can that be?

19:54.226 --> 19:56.160
Open it, open it.
- Open.

19:56.328 --> 19:58.319
What do you mean?
- They won't let us out.

19:58.497 --> 20:00.362
Who locked those doors?
- It's not us.

20:00.532 --> 20:03.228
Something is closing it from outside.

20:04.670 --> 20:05.932
We need an ambulance.

20:06.104 --> 20:09.403
Open the door. Open the door.

20:09.575 --> 20:12.203
Is there a doctor in the house?

20:12.377 --> 20:13.844
You're a doctor?
- I'm a vet.

20:14.012 --> 20:15.240
Come on.
- Get over here.

20:15.414 --> 20:18.042
Put some pressure on that wound.
- Give me that rag.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.275
Get something.

20:19.484 --> 20:21.418
Back up, back up.
- Cover him up.

20:21.587 --> 20:23.521
Why are they locking
if there's a fire?

20:23.689 --> 20:26.385
There's no fire, Wanda.
There is no fire.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.890
We have an officer down.
We have an officer down.

20:29.061 --> 20:32.360
I need an ambulance immediately.
I need backup.

20:32.531 --> 20:34.396
Does anybody copy?

20:34.900 --> 20:36.561
I have a fucking hurt officer here.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.203
What's going on?
Hey, what's happening?

20:39.638 --> 20:40.764
Why can't we leave?

20:40.939 --> 20:42.702
I know no more
than you do right now.

20:42.874 --> 20:44.933
Back up.

20:45.110 --> 20:46.771
My partner's on the floor bleeding.

20:46.945 --> 20:49.243
Quiet.
- Please remain calm.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.882
We are working hard
to get you out of the building.

20:52.050 --> 20:54.041
Please follow
the officers' instructions.

20:54.219 --> 20:55.709
This will all be over shortly.

20:55.887 --> 20:58.117
What will all be over?
- What's going on?

20:58.290 --> 20:59.951
Why are we locked in our building?

21:00.125 --> 21:01.649
Be calm. That's what that means.

21:01.827 --> 21:04.955
Please remain calm and everything's--
Get the camera out of here.

21:05.130 --> 21:07.621
Don't touch the camera.
We have every right to shoot.

21:07.799 --> 21:10.825
I'm tired of the camera.
- People need to see what's going on.

21:11.036 --> 21:12.628
I'm in charge here. Turn it off--

21:12.804 --> 21:15.637
If you were, you'd be worried
about getting your partner out.

21:15.807 --> 21:17.138
Not whether we're shooting.

21:17.309 --> 21:20.403
You are two steps
from being arrested, okay?

21:20.579 --> 21:22.069
This man will bleed to death.

21:22.247 --> 21:26.013
Everybody stop fighting, okay?
Stop fighting.

21:26.184 --> 21:28.675
We need to get this man out of here.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.779
What's behind that door?
- That's a fabric workshop.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.187
What is it?
- Fabric, fabric.

21:34.359 --> 21:37.920
ls there a way out from there?
- Yeah, through the back. Come, come.

21:41.433 --> 21:43.196
Keep them back.
- Please, please.

21:43.368 --> 21:45.928
You're not helping the situation.
Okay?

21:46.104 --> 21:48.095
My husband's outside.
Said there are cops.

21:48.273 --> 21:50.707
Blocked off the street.
He was getting antibiotics.

21:50.876 --> 21:52.867
We gotta do something--

21:53.078 --> 21:54.477
What the fuck.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.045
Jesus.
- Oh, Jesus.

21:56.214 --> 21:59.308
Oh, Jesus, Fletch.
- Oh, my God.

21:59.484 --> 22:00.974
Oh, Jesus.
- Okay, come on.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.314
Don't move him.
- No, we have to, we have to.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.854
Don't move him.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

22:06.391 --> 22:08.621
All right, he's still got a pulse.

22:08.794 --> 22:09.852
Shit.

22:10.028 --> 22:12.189
Get the vet over here.
Get the vet now.

22:12.364 --> 22:14.958
Vet, here, now.
- Get over here.

22:15.133 --> 22:16.725
Come here.
- Keep an eye on him.

22:16.902 --> 22:18.870
He's still got a pulse.
Take care of him.

22:19.037 --> 22:20.163
Okay, back away.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.739
All right. Come with me, let's go.

22:22.908 --> 22:25.172
Come on, come on.
You two stay here, all right?

22:25.344 --> 22:26.402
Stay here.

22:26.611 --> 22:28.238
Keep an eye on my partner, please.

22:28.413 --> 22:29.903
Come on.

22:33.251 --> 22:35.185
Let's get upstairs.

22:35.721 --> 22:37.154
Come on, let's get upstairs.

22:37.322 --> 22:39.119
I'm coming.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.997
The sound's coming from in there.

22:50.168 --> 22:51.726
Okay.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.472
Move over.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.825
Oh, Scott, don't.

23:50.695 --> 23:53.220
Don't go in there, Scott.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.923
Scott.

24:07.579 --> 24:09.843
Watch out.
- Oh, my God.

24:18.156 --> 24:19.623
She's dead.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.759
She's dead.

24:21.927 --> 24:23.588
She's dead.
- What?

24:23.762 --> 24:26.196
What are you two doing here?
Get the camera back.

24:26.364 --> 24:28.491
We need to get you guys out of here.

24:28.667 --> 24:31.295
Ma'am. Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am?

24:31.470 --> 24:34.337
Ma'am, listen to me.
Can you hear me, Miss Espinoza?

24:34.506 --> 24:37.031
I need you to stay
right where you are, okay?

24:37.242 --> 24:38.971
All right?
We wanna help you here.

24:39.144 --> 24:42.011
Put your hands in the air for me,
Mrs. Espinoza.

24:42.180 --> 24:45.274
Okay? Put your hands in the air.

24:49.254 --> 24:50.881
Oh, my God.

25:00.398 --> 25:01.956
Let's go.

25:02.767 --> 25:05.531
Put the gun down. Let's go.

25:05.704 --> 25:07.968
She was coming right at us.
- Yeah.

25:08.139 --> 25:10.198
You saw that, right?
- Yeah, I saw it.

25:10.375 --> 25:13.037
Shit. Okay.

25:13.211 --> 25:15.873
Okay, you saw that, right?

25:16.047 --> 25:17.742
Okay. All right.

25:17.916 --> 25:21.352
Let's just get downstairs.
Let's get downstairs.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.212
Hey, hey, hey.

25:24.389 --> 25:27.552
Easy, easy, easy.

26:15.073 --> 26:17.200
Did you get that?

26:17.375 --> 26:18.740
Yeah.

26:29.721 --> 26:31.120
Show it to me.

26:31.289 --> 26:33.780
Look, don't worry. I got it.
- I said show it to me..

26:33.959 --> 26:35.827
Okay. Okay, okay.

26:38.096 --> 26:41.224
What the hell was that?
- I don't know. I think--

26:41.399 --> 26:43.367
Is everything okay?

26:44.369 --> 26:47.236
We should probably
just get down the stairs, okay?

26:48.406 --> 26:50.966
I know, I know, I know.

26:51.142 --> 26:53.633
Oh, my God.
- We just have to get downstairs.

26:54.779 --> 26:56.246
Fire department.

26:56.414 --> 26:58.644
I need you to open up the door.

27:03.421 --> 27:05.514
Fire department.

27:10.395 --> 27:13.694
Fire department. We need everyone
to gather downstairs in the atrium.

27:13.898 --> 27:15.593
Yes, we need you to go downstairs.

27:15.767 --> 27:19.430
Was there a fire?
- No, it's just a precaution.

27:20.538 --> 27:21.869
Just a precaution for what?

27:22.040 --> 27:24.668
Look,
we just need you to get downstairs.

27:28.146 --> 27:31.809
Does this have anything to do
with the cable being out?

27:31.983 --> 27:35.146
Come on, let's go.
- What? Wait, wait, wait.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.983
What if I don't wanna go?
- Then I'd be forced to force you.

27:40.525 --> 27:42.152
Hi. I'm with the fire department.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.659
We need everyone
to gather in the atrium.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.998
Do you speak English?

27:50.168 --> 27:51.567
Do you speak English?

27:51.736 --> 27:53.704
English? No.

27:54.205 --> 27:56.901
Okay,
we need everybody downstairs, so....

27:57.075 --> 28:02.138
All right, there's people down there,
and we need you two to go there.

28:02.313 --> 28:04.645
You understand?

28:10.488 --> 28:12.581
Fire department.

28:17.162 --> 28:19.062
Fire department.

28:21.399 --> 28:22.957
Ma'am?

28:23.568 --> 28:25.229
Hello, ma'am?

28:33.511 --> 28:35.240
Ma'am, I'm with the fire department.

28:35.413 --> 28:38.849
We need you to quickly and calmly
walk down to the lobby, please.

28:40.985 --> 28:42.680
Excuse me, ma'am.

28:49.027 --> 28:50.426
Ma'am.

28:51.396 --> 28:54.126
Ma'am,
we need you to get downstairs, okay?

28:54.566 --> 28:55.624
What's wrong with her?

28:55.800 --> 28:57.392
I don't know.

29:00.872 --> 29:02.567
You wanna give me a hand?
- Yeah.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.403
I don't know that that's a good idea.
- She needs help.

29:05.577 --> 29:06.976
Just grab her.

29:07.145 --> 29:09.739
Okay. Now lift her up.

29:10.148 --> 29:11.706
Okay.

29:12.117 --> 29:14.608
We're just taking you downstairs,
okay, ma'am?

29:14.819 --> 29:16.377
All right?

29:17.422 --> 29:19.720
Oh, Jesus.

29:22.794 --> 29:24.785
Okay? Okay?

29:24.963 --> 29:28.421
Okay? Yeah.

29:29.267 --> 29:31.735
Oh, she's really sick.

29:43.348 --> 29:46.784
Holy shit. Did you see that?

29:46.951 --> 29:51.911
That rat just totally came after me.
Hey, did you see that?

29:52.290 --> 29:53.951
Come on.

29:56.961 --> 29:59.864
Un-fucking-believable.

29:59.864 --> 30:03.129
Oh, my God, look at Elise.
- Somebody grab that chair.

30:04.702 --> 30:07.262
What's wrong with her?
- Set her down, set her down.

30:07.438 --> 30:10.464
Can't stop the bleeding.
Get him to a hospital. He's gonna die.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.371
Stay here.
I'm gonna check the exit.

30:12.577 --> 30:14.545
No, no, wait.
We are under strict orders--

30:14.712 --> 30:17.010
We're under orders
to stay in the hall. Help me.

30:17.182 --> 30:19.980
Fuck your orders, all right?
My friend's dying.

30:21.119 --> 30:22.984
I'm coming out.
- Do not--...

30:23.154 --> 30:26.282
Didn't catch that. You're breaking up.
- Two people have died.

30:26.457 --> 30:30.052
Two others are in need of medical
care. Police have blocked off the exit.

30:30.228 --> 30:33.720
They've given us no explanation.
We're trying to find a way out.

30:33.898 --> 30:34.990
Oh, my God.
- Shit.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.997
Get away from the window.
- Go, go.

30:37.168 --> 30:39.398
You need to remain in the building.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.639
We have civilians in here.

30:58.223 --> 30:59.383
Briana, don't.

30:59.557 --> 31:03.323
Attention, please.
Do not try to leave the building.

31:03.494 --> 31:06.895
All exits have been sealed.
Just stay calm.

31:07.065 --> 31:10.262
We will send someone in there
shortly to assess the situation.

31:10.435 --> 31:13.268
Thank you for your cooperation.

31:13.438 --> 31:15.770
What are we supposed to do?

31:15.940 --> 31:18.932
What are we supposed to do?
- Just wait.

31:31.756 --> 31:34.782
There's five there. What happened?

31:46.604 --> 31:48.970
Sir, sir, sir.

31:49.173 --> 31:51.198
Give me your headphones.

31:55.914 --> 31:58.109
No, you're not getting my question.

31:58.283 --> 31:59.580
Not getting my question.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.878
I'm asking
why they're calling this a BNC.

32:02.053 --> 32:03.714
What's a BNC?
- I don't know.

32:03.888 --> 32:05.412
Hello?

32:05.590 --> 32:06.887
Hello?

32:07.058 --> 32:08.423
Hello?

32:08.593 --> 32:09.787
Hello?
- Hello?

32:09.961 --> 32:12.452
ls somebody there?
- Hello?

32:14.632 --> 32:16.725
Honey, hello?

32:18.236 --> 32:21.000
Why is the phone breaking?
Why is it not working?

32:21.205 --> 32:23.935
What's a BNC?
- Who said anything about--?

32:24.108 --> 32:25.598
You. You're still miked.
- Wait.

32:25.777 --> 32:26.835
What?
- Don't jump to--

32:27.011 --> 32:28.672
What's a BNC? What is it?

32:28.846 --> 32:31.246
They're calling this a BNC?

32:32.317 --> 32:34.342
A biological,
nuclear or chemical threat.

32:34.519 --> 32:35.952
Oh, my God.
- Nuclear?

32:36.120 --> 32:37.610
What?
- No, don't worry, okay?

32:37.789 --> 32:40.781
It's more common than you think.
- Supposed to be reassuring?

32:40.959 --> 32:44.258
Our cell phones don't work.
Neither do the TVs or our radios.

32:44.429 --> 32:46.420
Why are they isolating us?
- I don't know.

32:46.597 --> 32:47.996
My daughter has a fever.

32:48.166 --> 32:50.293
What does she have?
- They're pointing guns.

32:50.468 --> 32:51.958
You can't keep us trapped here.

32:52.136 --> 32:53.763
We're all trapped.
- That's right.

32:53.938 --> 32:56.498
We are all trapped in here.
Step over here.

32:56.674 --> 32:58.039
Here.
- What will they do?

32:58.242 --> 33:00.710
Step over here, please.
- Jake, Jake.

33:00.878 --> 33:05.679
There might be-- From the office on
the second floor, there is an overhang.

33:05.850 --> 33:09.149
Maybe we can use
to jump down to the patio.

33:09.620 --> 33:11.053
Let's go.
- I show you.

33:11.255 --> 33:12.890
I'm going with you.

33:19.263 --> 33:20.457
Don't turn the light on.

33:20.631 --> 33:22.963
I don't want anyone knowing
we're in here.

33:27.071 --> 33:28.766
Careful.

33:46.824 --> 33:48.348
When I open the window--
- Yeah?

33:48.526 --> 33:50.221
go to the right side and jump.

33:50.395 --> 33:52.989
It's only two and a half meters.

33:59.203 --> 34:00.864
Get away from the window.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.370
For your own safety.
- No.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.235
Step away.
- Wait, wait, wait.

34:04.409 --> 34:05.842
Step away.
- Wait, listen.

34:06.010 --> 34:08.342
Can you see me? Can you see me?

34:08.513 --> 34:12.005
What are you doing?
- We have a film crew in here.

34:12.183 --> 34:14.879
Tell your boss
we have a TV crew in here.

34:15.053 --> 34:18.853
We are filming this. Please, wait.

34:19.023 --> 34:21.184
People are gonna see
what you're doing to us.

34:21.359 --> 34:25.318
Why can't we go out?
- People are gonna see this.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.797
Please. Wait.

34:31.969 --> 34:33.937
What are you doing in here?

34:34.105 --> 34:36.266
You knew about this, didn't you?
- Knew what?

34:36.440 --> 34:38.534
That they're sealing us in here.

34:38.708 --> 34:41.074
What the fuck is this?

34:43.481 --> 34:45.039
What is going on?
- You tell us.

34:45.216 --> 34:48.617
I don't know anything and don't you
fucking put your hands on me again.

34:48.786 --> 34:51.721
I don't know anything, okay?

34:52.290 --> 34:53.621
Get this fucking camera out.

34:53.791 --> 34:55.782
Don't touch me.
- Don't touch that camera.

34:55.960 --> 34:58.121
We need to show people
what's going on here.

34:58.296 --> 35:00.127
Only proof we have.
- Don't you get it?

35:00.298 --> 35:03.597
You're locked in here like us.
You think they give a shit about you?

35:03.768 --> 35:05.998
Step back.
- Hey, hey, hey.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.570
Let's all just calm down, all right?
- Shut up.

35:08.739 --> 35:11.469
Put the gun down.
- Shut up.

35:12.176 --> 35:14.337
Go back downstairs now, okay?

35:14.512 --> 35:15.979
Yeah, okay, okay, but--

35:16.147 --> 35:17.739
Shut up.

35:17.915 --> 35:20.611
Damn. Go back downstairs.

35:20.785 --> 35:22.685
This thing is getting to all of us.

35:22.887 --> 35:25.082
No one here
is gonna hurt you, okay?

35:25.256 --> 35:27.850
We're trying to get out.
That's all we're trying to do.

35:28.025 --> 35:30.425
Just put the gun down.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.622
I'm sorry, man.

35:36.267 --> 35:39.293
I'm sorry, all right?
- Yeah.

35:39.470 --> 35:41.097
I was just freaked out. Let's go.

35:41.272 --> 35:42.967
We all are.
- Go downstairs, okay?

35:43.141 --> 35:46.201
All right?
- Yeah, let's get downstairs, man.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.669
Shit.

35:49.413 --> 35:50.937
Fuck.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.229
Grab his legs, okay?
Come on, let's go.

36:10.434 --> 36:12.493
What we'll do
is we'll roll him on his side.

36:12.670 --> 36:16.197
We just have to be really careful.

36:16.374 --> 36:20.367
What time is it?
- One-thirty-seven.

36:21.479 --> 36:24.346
Five, four, three....

36:24.815 --> 36:27.648
It's 1:37 in the morning,
and everyone is scared.

36:27.818 --> 36:30.582
They've given us no information,
cut off communication...

36:30.755 --> 36:34.418
...from walkie-talkies and cell phones
to the building's cable and lnternet.

36:34.592 --> 36:37.652
The people trapped here,
myself included...

36:37.828 --> 36:40.319
...can't help but ask why.

37:06.390 --> 37:08.358
How's he doing?

37:09.527 --> 37:11.290
Well, he's not good.

37:16.867 --> 37:18.425
Yeah.

37:21.706 --> 37:23.901
Yeah.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.976
Excuse me. It's Terrence, right?

37:27.144 --> 37:30.113
No, Lawrence.
- Lawrence, right.

37:30.281 --> 37:34.081
Listen, I've got a ton of Vicodin
in my apartment, if that will help.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.651
Yeah, that's gonna help.

37:35.820 --> 37:37.720
I'll just-- I'll grab a bunch of stuff.

37:37.888 --> 37:41.221
I basically got a pharmacy up there.

37:42.660 --> 37:45.595
You can't arrest me for that,
because of self-incrimination--

37:45.763 --> 37:49.324
Sir, you are the least
of my worries right now, okay?

37:49.533 --> 37:51.797
All right, I was just asking.
- Go.

37:51.969 --> 37:53.994
Do what you're gonna do, please.

37:54.171 --> 37:57.538
I'm going. I'm going.

38:02.913 --> 38:05.006
You ever seen
anything like this before?

38:05.182 --> 38:08.015
No, I've never
seen anything like this.

38:08.185 --> 38:10.483
Mostly because I'm a vet.

38:10.655 --> 38:14.250
I don't usually treat people.
Dogs and cats, mostly.

38:14.425 --> 38:17.861
All I can really do is I can dress
their wounds and try to comfort them.

38:18.062 --> 38:19.825
How are the injured men doing?

38:19.997 --> 38:22.830
They both lost a lot of blood,
and the fireman over here...

38:23.000 --> 38:27.369
...he's got a bunch of broken bones
and probable internal bleeding.

38:27.772 --> 38:34.336
Apparently, Mrs. Espinoza attacked
and bit them in some kind of a fit.

38:34.512 --> 38:38.141
But honestly,
I find that a little hard to believe...

38:38.316 --> 38:43.310
...that an old lady could do
something like this to two grown men.

38:44.588 --> 38:46.886
Ready? Ready to film?

38:47.725 --> 38:49.124
Okay.

38:49.293 --> 38:51.818
What's your name?
- Briana.

38:51.996 --> 38:55.454
Briana, that's a very pretty name.
How old are you, Briana?

38:55.633 --> 38:59.160
Five.
- And who do you live with?

38:59.337 --> 39:02.898
With my mom
and my dad and my dog, Max.

39:03.107 --> 39:05.735
Max. I haven't met Max. Where is he?

39:05.910 --> 39:08.879
My dad took him to the vet
because he's sick.

39:09.046 --> 39:11.742
You sound a little sick yourself.
- Yeah.

39:11.916 --> 39:15.647
She's had it for weeks, it's not like--
- You know what?

39:15.820 --> 39:19.221
If you don't mind, I'd like to keep
you quiet while I interview Briana.

39:19.390 --> 39:22.188
It confuses the audience
when people talk from off-camera.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.487
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
- No, no, it's okay.

39:24.662 --> 39:26.994
I'll interview you afterwards.
- No, that's fine.

39:27.164 --> 39:28.495
Okay.
- We don't need that.

39:28.666 --> 39:30.657
Okay, thank you.

39:30.835 --> 39:33.201
I don't like being sick.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.931
Yeah, I don't like being sick either.

39:36.140 --> 39:38.005
Briana, you're a very brave girl...

39:38.175 --> 39:40.575
...and I'm really happy
we got a chance to meet.

39:40.745 --> 39:41.837
Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:42.012 --> 39:43.946
She's been fearless
since she was little.

39:44.148 --> 39:46.283
She's an incredibly strong child.

39:46.283 --> 39:48.012
Okay? Okay.

39:48.185 --> 39:50.619
Why don't you just start
by introducing yourselves?

39:50.788 --> 39:53.916
Well, I'm Ber-- I'm Bernard.
This is my roommate, Sadie.

39:54.091 --> 39:55.285
And this is Martini.

39:55.459 --> 39:57.552
And how long
have you lived in the building?

39:57.728 --> 39:59.195
I've lived here six years.

39:59.363 --> 40:01.092
I've been here two and a half years.

40:01.265 --> 40:03.392
And what do you do for a living?

40:03.567 --> 40:04.761
I'm an opera teacher.

40:04.935 --> 40:08.063
Sadie's my best student, my protege.

40:11.075 --> 40:13.976
Oh, my God.
- Fletcher.

40:14.178 --> 40:15.941
Where's the vet?

40:16.113 --> 40:17.239
Oh, my God.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.713
Where the hell is the doctor?

40:19.884 --> 40:22.045
I got him, got him, got him.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.821
Hold him, hold him.
Hold his neck, hold his neck.

40:25.990 --> 40:27.082
What is that?

40:27.258 --> 40:29.954
Hold it over, hold his neck.
- Go, go, go.

40:30.127 --> 40:32.152
Oh, my God, is he still alive?

40:32.329 --> 40:35.127
Hold him still, hold him still.
He's gonna go down.

40:38.335 --> 40:39.666
Martini.

40:39.837 --> 40:41.828
Sadie, stay here. Stay.

40:42.006 --> 40:44.839
No, no, stay here, stay here.
No, the dog will come back.

40:45.009 --> 40:46.806
Martini.

40:46.977 --> 40:48.569
Hold him.

40:58.789 --> 41:01.019
Okay, I have to show you something.
- What?

41:01.225 --> 41:03.022
Have to show you something.
Just a sec.

41:03.227 --> 41:04.854
I think I know what this is.

41:05.029 --> 41:10.296
Come, come look, look, look.
- Oh, Jesus.

41:10.468 --> 41:13.266
Her tear ducts and salivary glands
are constantly flowing.

41:13.437 --> 41:15.837
She seems
to be unable to swallow or speak.

41:16.006 --> 41:17.598
She has a fever, she's confused.

41:17.775 --> 41:20.266
She has some degree
of paralysis and delirium.

41:20.444 --> 41:24.005
These are all rabies symptoms.

41:24.181 --> 41:25.614
Are you sure?
- I'm a vet.

41:25.783 --> 41:28.547
Never seen it in humans,
but I know what rabies look like.

41:28.752 --> 41:31.186
Are you trying to tell me
these people have rabies?

41:31.355 --> 41:32.982
Tears, saliva, fever.

41:33.157 --> 41:36.524
Tears, saliva, fever.
They have what she has.

41:36.694 --> 41:39.891
But here's the thing. Rabies
takes months for symptoms to show.

41:40.064 --> 41:43.363
This is taking minutes.
I mean, rabies never acts this fast.

41:43.534 --> 41:45.331
How does rabies spread?
Through bites?

41:45.503 --> 41:48.995
No, it's passed through anything wet.
Blood, saliva, any mucous membrane.

41:49.173 --> 41:52.233
So if you get their blood on you,
you're okay.

41:52.409 --> 41:54.138
But if you get their blood on you...

41:54.311 --> 41:56.643
...and it gets into a cut,
into your mouth, eyes...

41:56.814 --> 41:59.078
...then you're not okay.

41:59.283 --> 42:01.012
How's it cured?

42:02.086 --> 42:03.678
No, there's no cure.

42:03.854 --> 42:05.845
People get shots in their stomach.

42:06.023 --> 42:07.513
Before symptoms starts showing.

42:07.691 --> 42:11.684
Once symptoms show,
rabies is 1 00 percent fatal.

42:12.930 --> 42:14.557
Shit.

42:14.732 --> 42:17.496
Yeah, shit.

42:19.403 --> 42:19.503
Where are you going? Where?
- I'm going up to my apartment.

42:19.503 --> 42:22.529
Where are you going? Where?
- I'm going up to my apartment.

42:22.706 --> 42:24.401
What?
- I am going upstairs.

42:24.575 --> 42:25.701
You can't do that.

42:25.876 --> 42:27.036
Why?
- Come down.

42:27.211 --> 42:28.337
Why?
- What do you mean?

42:28.512 --> 42:30.673
Why can't I go?
- We gonna do this all night?

42:30.848 --> 42:32.907
You know why?
- Because it's not safe there.

42:33.083 --> 42:35.711
Oh, yeah,
because it's really safe down here.

42:35.886 --> 42:37.410
You're drunk.
- You know what?

42:37.588 --> 42:40.716
It seems to me, if this is spreading,
maybe we should separate...

42:40.891 --> 42:42.882
...instead of sitting here
in a big group.

42:43.060 --> 42:45.961
You done? You finished?

42:46.130 --> 42:47.392
You done?
- You know what?

42:47.565 --> 42:52.264
I have a God-given right to protect
myself as I see fit, so you know what?

42:52.436 --> 42:54.301
I'm gonna go upstairs--
- Step back.

42:54.471 --> 42:57.372
I'm gonna go and I'm
gonna barricade the shit out of it.

42:57.541 --> 43:00.942
Where do you think they're going?
- You can all sit here and rot.

43:01.111 --> 43:02.942
Oh, you are so close to going to jail.

43:03.113 --> 43:06.605
Are you some kind of affirmative--?
- You are so close to going to jail.

43:06.784 --> 43:08.115
Hey.
- Hurry up, hurry up.

43:08.285 --> 43:09.912
What?
- Where are you going?

43:10.087 --> 43:12.487
Look, this lets out
right next to our apartment.

43:12.656 --> 43:15.318
We wanna see if there's anything
on the news about this.

43:15.492 --> 43:16.823
But the cable's out.
- Cable?

43:16.994 --> 43:19.394
We still use rabbit ears on our TV.

43:19.563 --> 43:23.158
We're going with you.
Wait, wait, wait, we're going with you.

43:25.603 --> 43:27.935
It's just up here to the right.

43:33.911 --> 43:35.310
You're good?

43:35.479 --> 43:37.811
Stop. Just stop.
- What?

43:37.982 --> 43:39.279
Go back downstairs.

43:39.450 --> 43:41.941
The door locked behind me.

43:42.453 --> 43:44.614
Just stay there.

43:45.489 --> 43:46.979
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

43:47.157 --> 43:48.886
Hey, look out.

43:49.293 --> 43:50.851
Oh, my God.
- Look out.

43:51.028 --> 43:54.156
No, no, no.

43:57.801 --> 44:01.328
We can't just open the door. We need
something to hold the dog back with.

44:01.505 --> 44:05.407
Find something.
- There's a fire extinguisher.

44:06.343 --> 44:08.641
Oh, my God.

44:10.614 --> 44:12.013
Stop, stop.

44:12.182 --> 44:13.843
Listen.

44:16.453 --> 44:19.422
Turn it off, Scott. Turn it off.

44:21.325 --> 44:23.190
Oh, I forgot something.

44:23.360 --> 44:25.692
Shouldn't we shut the door?
- Close the door.

44:26.930 --> 44:29.330
Okay.
- I left the music on.

44:29.500 --> 44:30.967
Folk music.

44:31.135 --> 44:33.126
The TV's back here.

44:33.303 --> 44:35.032
All right.

44:36.373 --> 44:38.068
Okay.

44:38.475 --> 44:41.035
It usually takes
a couple of seconds to....

44:41.211 --> 44:43.372
There we go, all right.

44:44.048 --> 44:45.811
Fiddle with this--
- Make sure that--

44:45.983 --> 44:47.473
No, I know what I'm doing.

44:47.651 --> 44:49.516
No, I'm--
- Yeah, I know, all right?

44:49.687 --> 44:51.848
...third hour of our coverage.
- There.

44:52.022 --> 44:54.820
There it is.
- ...receiving conflicting reports.

44:55.159 --> 44:58.094
hind me was comp-- Evacuated....

45:01.732 --> 45:03.996
that the CDC...

45:05.102 --> 45:06.694
Chief.

45:06.870 --> 45:10.328
Tell us why the CDC
is entering the building.

45:10.607 --> 45:14.338
Precaution.
Everyone's been evacuated.

45:15.379 --> 45:17.006
What?

45:17.881 --> 45:19.280
Why would he broadcast that?

45:19.483 --> 45:21.075
Why would he say that?

45:21.251 --> 45:23.879
What the fuck is going on here?

45:26.790 --> 45:28.121
What happened?
- Power's out.

45:28.292 --> 45:30.726
Oh, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

45:30.894 --> 45:34.421
What was that?
- Quiet.

45:37.801 --> 45:41.202
Sadie, stay with me.
Sadie, come here.

45:41.538 --> 45:44.029
Sadie, come over here.

45:44.608 --> 45:47.202
Stay with me. It cannot be.

45:47.377 --> 45:49.368
Stay with me.
- You gotta close that door.

45:49.546 --> 45:51.514
Sadie, look out.

45:53.717 --> 45:55.207
Get off me.
- Oh, my God.

45:55.385 --> 45:58.149
Get off of me.

46:01.458 --> 46:04.222
Bernard, stay with me.

46:12.536 --> 46:14.470
Hit her again.

46:26.416 --> 46:28.941
Oh, my God.

46:35.125 --> 46:37.923
Angela, you have blood
all over your shirt.

47:06.723 --> 47:09.214
Scott.
- What?

47:10.594 --> 47:12.323
Scott.

47:14.331 --> 47:18.233
What do you want?

47:19.870 --> 47:21.838
You okay?

47:23.373 --> 47:25.068
Yeah, I'm just fine.

47:25.242 --> 47:27.676
I mean, I just killed something
with my camera...

47:27.845 --> 47:30.336
...and, you know, I'm just fine.

47:30.514 --> 47:32.243
Yeah.

47:33.483 --> 47:35.246
Scott.

47:36.687 --> 47:38.655
What, Angela? What you...?

47:39.323 --> 47:41.416
I need a moment now.

47:44.494 --> 47:46.359
I'm with you.

47:52.436 --> 47:57.738
I'm with you, you're with me, okay?
- Okay, okay, okay, we're here.

47:58.642 --> 48:00.735
We're here together, all right?

48:00.911 --> 48:03.937
We get out of here as fast
as we fucking can, you hear me?

48:04.147 --> 48:06.342
Okay, okay.
- Together?

48:09.353 --> 48:11.184
That everybody?
- Getting the last one.

48:11.355 --> 48:13.448
All right, keep going.

48:13.657 --> 48:17.093
All right, it's been a long,
exhausting night for all of us...

48:17.261 --> 48:19.525
...but we just got word from outside.

48:19.696 --> 48:22.096
Well, it's about bloody fucking time,
isn't it?

48:22.266 --> 48:24.427
Yes, they told me
they're sending in the CDC.

48:24.601 --> 48:25.863
CDC?
- What's--?

48:26.036 --> 48:27.697
Center for Disease Control.
- Why?

48:27.871 --> 48:30.237
Yes, but relax, it's fine.
They're gonna come in.

48:30.407 --> 48:33.308
They're gonna run blood tests
on residents to clarify things.

48:33.477 --> 48:36.275
Just the residents?
- No, everybody.

48:36.446 --> 48:38.277
Everybody,
so once they check it out...

48:38.448 --> 48:41.383
...make sure everything's okay,
we should be able to get out.

48:41.551 --> 48:43.109
Oh, thank God.
- That won't work.

48:43.287 --> 48:46.620
What are you talking about?
- That doesn't work, not for rabies.

48:46.790 --> 48:50.385
Nobody said anything about rabies.
- I did, I told you it was rabies.

48:50.560 --> 48:52.152
How do you test for rabies?

48:52.329 --> 48:54.820
There's only one way.
You gotta get a brain sample.

48:54.998 --> 48:56.329
Come on.
- Man, just shut up.

48:56.500 --> 48:59.128
What you have to do.
- Let's make sure everyone's here.

48:59.303 --> 49:00.770
A simple 'here' will be fine.

49:00.938 --> 49:03.304
So let's get started.

49:03.974 --> 49:05.771
How many units per floor?
- Three.

49:05.943 --> 49:07.069
There are three.
- Okay.

49:07.244 --> 49:09.838
Second floor, Unit A,
that's where Mrs. Espinoza lives?

49:10.013 --> 49:11.344
Yes.
- Who's in B?

49:11.515 --> 49:13.005
Me and Sadie.
- Here.

49:13.216 --> 49:15.116
Who's in Unit C?

49:15.285 --> 49:16.445
Unit C.

49:16.620 --> 49:18.281
The lawyer.

49:18.455 --> 49:19.513
Randy.
- Elevat--

49:19.723 --> 49:21.987
All right, third floor, Unit A.
Who's up there?

49:22.159 --> 49:25.026
That's me, my daughter
and my husband, who's been outside--

49:25.228 --> 49:26.991
Yes, yes, yes, we know. Thank you.

49:27.164 --> 49:28.688
Unit B, please.
- Us.

49:28.865 --> 49:30.799
My wife and me.
- Who's in Unit C?

49:30.968 --> 49:32.299
Vacant.
- Why we doing this?

49:32.469 --> 49:34.130
Vacant.
- Nobody's been there--...

49:34.304 --> 49:37.831
Fourth floor, Unit A, who's up there?
- That was Elise. She's dead.

49:38.008 --> 49:39.805
What?
- She's dead?

49:39.977 --> 49:43.378
4B, who's in B?
- It's me, me, here.

49:44.681 --> 49:47.616
Who's in C?
- It's them.

49:47.784 --> 49:48.842
You two?

49:49.019 --> 49:51.715
They don't understand you.
Them and her father.

49:51.888 --> 49:55.187
And her father's upstairs?
- Sick, he's paralytic.

49:55.359 --> 49:57.623
Maybe this is all his fault.

49:57.794 --> 50:01.355
How do you know? You don't know--
- Listen up, all right, let's finish up.

50:01.531 --> 50:03.863
Okay.
- Somebody knows.

50:04.034 --> 50:06.730
What was I even gonna say?
Who lives in the attic?

50:06.903 --> 50:11.465
A man from Boston. He rents it,
but I haven't seen him in months.

50:11.641 --> 50:14.337
Wait, if her father's upstairs,
should we bring him down?

50:14.511 --> 50:17.173
What if he's the cause?
We can't bring sick people here.

50:17.347 --> 50:20.510
Your daughter's sick, isn't she?
- She has fever. Hardly the same.

50:20.684 --> 50:22.914
Yeah, so we should bring
her father downstairs.

50:23.086 --> 50:24.678
Hey, hey.
- Stop, stop it.

50:24.855 --> 50:26.413
Hey.
- Stop fighting.

50:26.590 --> 50:28.649
Listen.
- How many times you gonna do this?

50:28.825 --> 50:30.588
Nobody's going.
We're gonna stay here.

50:30.794 --> 50:33.763
They'll let us know
when they wanna move us, period.

50:33.930 --> 50:35.522
Can we finish?

50:35.699 --> 50:36.825
Fine.
- Thank you.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.558
The cleaning lady.

50:38.735 --> 50:39.895
Yeah, the cleaning lady.

50:40.070 --> 50:42.698
The cleaning lady was here.
- I saw her this morning.

50:42.873 --> 50:44.534
She's deceased.

50:44.708 --> 50:46.005
What?
- What did he say?

50:46.176 --> 50:47.871
What?
- She's gone.

50:57.554 --> 51:00.250
Stand back from the door.

51:01.458 --> 51:02.925
Open the door.

51:03.126 --> 51:05.526
Show me your hands.
- L.A.P.D.

51:18.875 --> 51:21.036
CDC's now making their way
into the building.

51:21.211 --> 51:23.008
There are security measures in place.

51:23.180 --> 51:25.148
We still have no idea
what's happening.

51:25.348 --> 51:28.078
From the look of the precaution
that they're taking...

51:28.251 --> 51:30.583
...it's something very serious.

51:31.788 --> 51:35.485
I want you
to just keep this area clear.

52:07.023 --> 52:08.650
This is....

52:08.825 --> 52:10.690
This is blood from my partner here.

52:10.894 --> 52:15.092
He's in the back. This blood
is from the second firefighter.

52:20.170 --> 52:21.865
You, turn it off. Turn it off now.

52:22.038 --> 52:23.130
Now. Turn it off.

52:23.306 --> 52:24.967
Okay, okay, it's off.

52:25.142 --> 52:27.133
Jesus.

52:28.612 --> 52:30.671
Okay, everyone here.
Everybody here is good.

52:30.847 --> 52:33.543
The two guys are in the back.
That's all we can tell you.

52:33.717 --> 52:36.208
I don't know anything else right now.
- Okay.

52:36.419 --> 52:39.115
Just take me to the injured.
Everyone else stays here.

52:39.289 --> 52:41.280
You heard him. Stay here.

52:43.493 --> 52:45.427
Clear this area.

52:50.433 --> 52:53.231
They tell us to stay calm,
and they come dressed like that?

52:53.436 --> 52:57.702
It's gonna be all right.
- What? You honestly believe that?

53:06.516 --> 53:08.507
I'm gonna open it.

53:15.225 --> 53:17.193
Can you see?

53:17.360 --> 53:18.657
That's good. That's good.

53:18.828 --> 53:21.888
I'm gonna take samples
from both men.

53:36.379 --> 53:38.711
Up here. Up here.

53:38.882 --> 53:40.213
Okay.
- Can you get up there?

53:40.383 --> 53:42.112
Yeah, okay, cool.

53:42.285 --> 53:45.345
Hey, hold this, hold this.

53:48.091 --> 53:49.922
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

53:50.093 --> 53:51.617
You got it?

53:53.897 --> 53:55.228
Okay, give it to me.

53:55.398 --> 53:57.423
Give me the camera, come on.

53:57.601 --> 54:00.069
Give me the camera.

54:03.240 --> 54:05.470
Can you see?
- Yeah.

54:05.642 --> 54:07.507
What's happening?

54:07.911 --> 54:10.402
They're handcuffing him.
- Who?

54:10.580 --> 54:12.309
Fletcher.

54:23.260 --> 54:25.751
The other one's got a syringe.

54:37.774 --> 54:40.265
He just gave Fletcher a shot.

55:04.868 --> 55:07.268
Oh, shit.
- What?

55:07.437 --> 55:09.564
He's got a drill.

55:14.644 --> 55:17.841
Oh, Jesus.
- What?

55:18.014 --> 55:20.505
I think the vet was right.

55:27.590 --> 55:30.650
I think he's taking a brain sample.

55:53.650 --> 55:56.118
Holy shit.
- Scott?

55:57.153 --> 55:58.984
Hey, look out.

56:09.366 --> 56:10.533
Angela, run. Run.

56:10.533 --> 56:12.660
Angela, run. Run.

56:14.537 --> 56:16.402
The vet's in there.
He's still in there.

56:16.573 --> 56:18.666
Open the door.
- We can't, he's been bitten.

56:18.842 --> 56:21.572
Come on, let him out.
- I'm not infected, you're wrong.

56:21.745 --> 56:23.269
I'm not infected. I'm all right.

56:23.446 --> 56:25.744
They didn't get me.
- What are you talking about?

56:25.915 --> 56:29.248
Are you sure he's been bitten?
- Yes, and I'm not taking any chances.

56:29.419 --> 56:32.115
Back away till the infected people
have been handcuffed.

56:32.288 --> 56:34.085
Infected with what?

56:34.257 --> 56:37.590
Would you get that out of my face?
- What happens happens in the open.

56:37.761 --> 56:40.525
They have a right to shoot this,
okay?

56:44.067 --> 56:45.625
You okay?
- Lawrence.

56:45.802 --> 56:47.292
Lawrence, you okay?

56:47.470 --> 56:49.631
God, this isn't right.

56:49.806 --> 56:51.273
Calm down, calm down. No.

56:51.441 --> 56:55.537
It's not right.
- lt would not be right to let him out--

57:02.285 --> 57:03.616
You tell us what's going on.

57:03.787 --> 57:05.652
I'm not authorized to tell--
- Bullshit.

57:05.822 --> 57:08.222
You left my friend
because he tried to kill you.

57:08.391 --> 57:09.449
Tell us what you know.

57:09.626 --> 57:12.424
Tell us what you know.
- Yeah, okay, goddamn, okay.

57:12.595 --> 57:15.496
We got a call from a vet
who had a sick dog brought in.

57:15.698 --> 57:19.065
They ran the routine tests,
it was nothing they'd ever seen before.

57:19.235 --> 57:21.396
Then it started
attacking the other animals.

57:21.571 --> 57:23.732
And within an hour,
all the injured animals...

57:23.907 --> 57:26.671
...showed the same kind
of aggression.

57:26.843 --> 57:30.574
Yeah. The dog's collar
led us to this building.

57:31.748 --> 57:33.943
Was the dog's name Max?

57:34.117 --> 57:35.607
Yes.

57:39.255 --> 57:42.782
She only has bronchitis.
- Bullshit, bronchitis.

57:42.959 --> 57:45.587
No, don't you dare.
- Kathy.

57:45.762 --> 57:47.354
Bronchitis.
- We need to find out.

57:47.530 --> 57:49.430
Relax, ma'am. Relax.
We have to be sure.

57:49.599 --> 57:50.861
No, get away from me.

57:51.034 --> 57:53.127
Dog spread the infection
through his saliva.

57:53.303 --> 57:54.429
We just gotta check.

57:54.604 --> 57:56.094
Let him do a check, ma'am.
- No.

57:56.272 --> 57:57.364
That's all we gotta do.

57:57.540 --> 57:59.974
That's all she has, just bronchitis.

58:00.143 --> 58:02.304
No.
- Go, go.

58:02.479 --> 58:04.606
Get back. Get back.

58:04.781 --> 58:06.942
Get back. Watch out.

58:07.484 --> 58:10.282
Run, Briana. Run, sweetheart.

58:10.453 --> 58:12.387
Get the girl.
- No, get away from her.

58:12.555 --> 58:14.523
Hold her. Hold her.
- Run.

58:14.691 --> 58:16.682
Run, sweetie, please.
- Get the handcuffs.

58:16.860 --> 58:19.522
Come on, come on.
- No, let me go.

58:19.696 --> 58:21.357
Don't hurt her. Please.

58:21.531 --> 58:23.362
Please,
you need to get us out of here.

58:23.533 --> 58:26.024
Stop it. Stop it.

58:26.269 --> 58:27.827
Cuff her.
- No.

58:28.004 --> 58:29.062
Come here. Come.

58:29.272 --> 58:30.671
Honey.
- She's cuffed.

58:30.840 --> 58:32.068
Honey.
- Back away.

58:32.275 --> 58:35.676
Back away.
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

58:36.513 --> 58:37.571
No.
- Father.

58:37.780 --> 58:38.838
Father.
- What father?

58:39.015 --> 58:41.313
Her father's sick in bed.
- Nobody told me that.

58:41.484 --> 58:43.145
We thought everyone was down here.

58:43.319 --> 58:45.549
All right, here. Take this.

58:45.722 --> 58:47.485
Get the girl and inject her with it.

58:47.657 --> 58:49.852
No, no.
- And you, bring everybody down here.

58:50.026 --> 58:51.755
Bring Briana. Okay.

58:51.928 --> 58:54.556
Kathy, we're gonna get her.
We're gonna bring her down.

58:54.731 --> 58:56.392
Run, honey.
- Going up.

58:56.566 --> 58:58.329
We're not gonna hurt you.
- Get away.

58:58.501 --> 59:02.597
Get away from her. Honey.

59:02.805 --> 59:03.273
Briana.

59:03.273 --> 59:04.900
Briana.

59:05.074 --> 59:06.371
Run.

59:06.543 --> 59:08.773
Honey.

59:08.945 --> 59:11.709
Briana.

59:11.881 --> 59:13.940
Get away from her.

59:14.117 --> 59:15.584
Oh, God.

59:15.752 --> 59:18.016
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

59:21.457 --> 59:24.824
Okay, okay. All right.

59:26.863 --> 59:28.592
Briana?

59:30.333 --> 59:31.960
Oh, God.

59:35.071 --> 59:37.904
Where the hell's the old lady?
- The old lady's gone.

59:42.045 --> 59:43.103
Briana?

59:43.279 --> 59:45.975
Okay. Just take it easy, okay?

59:46.149 --> 59:47.912
Briana?

59:55.725 --> 59:57.352
Briana?

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:07.797
Oh, Briana.

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:10.735
Briana?
- Briana?

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:12.806
Shit.

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:15.405
Shit, I'm sorry.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.472
Briana?

01:00:26.489 --> 01:00:28.252
Oh, shit.

01:00:32.895 --> 01:00:34.624
Briana?

01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:39.393
Oh, I think she's in here, Jake.

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:43.328
Hell.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:47.439
She's over there. She's over there.

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:49.309
You all right?

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:52.209
Now, I need you
to give me your hand, okay?

01:00:52.615 --> 01:00:54.207
Okay?

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:56.642
What happened to her eyes?

01:01:02.525 --> 01:01:05.221
Please don't stop. Please, don't.

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:07.157
Get her off me.

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:09.463
Go, go.

01:01:09.632 --> 01:01:12.066
She bit me. Go, Jake.

01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:18.532
Get out of here.
- Go, go, go.

01:01:18.708 --> 01:01:20.699
Come on, go. Let's go.

01:01:20.877 --> 01:01:22.674
Go, go, go.
- They're getting out.

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:24.574
They're getting out.

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:26.510
No, no, no.

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:28.310
Go back.
- They're getting out.

01:01:28.484 --> 01:01:32.352
Oh, they're getting out. Run, run.

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:47.993
Don't go. Wait.

01:01:52.408 --> 01:01:54.933
They're getting close. Run.

01:01:55.111 --> 01:01:55.511
Okay. Run. Run.

01:01:55.511 --> 01:01:57.775
Okay. Run. Run.

01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:59.971
Don't leave me.

01:02:00.616 --> 01:02:03.050
Don't leave me.
- I'm not gonna leave her.

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:05.551
Don't leave me.
- We have to get out of here.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:09.214
It's not right. It's not right.

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:18.697
Come on.
- No, no, not that way. This way.

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.074
Hurry up, come on.
Where are the others?

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:27.300
Come on, let's go.

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:31.141
Hurry up.

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:34.010
Lock it, lock it, lock it.
- Hurry up.

01:02:50.466 --> 01:02:52.798
Help me, help me.

01:03:10.253 --> 01:03:11.311
Were you bitten?
- No.

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:13.148
You?
- No.

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:15.449
You?
- No.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:17.183
Scott?

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:20.185
Scott?

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:22.957
Were you bitten?
- No.

01:03:24.066 --> 01:03:25.624
Angie?

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:27.834
No.

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:32.571
Hey, what about you?
- No, no.

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:35.768
Hey, you.

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:37.207
On the floor.

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:40.645
Hey, you been bitten?
- No, no.

01:03:41.117 --> 01:03:43.779
Jake, did you find the little girl?

01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:45.978
Who gives a shit about the little girl?

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:48.487
All right.
We've lost control of the building.

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:50.353
We're fucked.

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:52.492
Damn it.

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:55.358
I don't understand.

01:03:57.233 --> 01:03:59.861
I don't understand.
They were biting her face off.

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:01.901
I don't know
what the fuck is happening.

01:04:02.104 --> 01:04:03.731
Damn it.
- I don't understand.

01:04:03.906 --> 01:04:06.739
We could all be infected by now.
We gotta get out of here.

01:04:06.909 --> 01:04:08.171
I'm not moving. I'm done.

01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:10.710
I'm not moving.
- Hey, we wait here, we wait here.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.643
We have to get out of here.
- Listen.

01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:16.751
We have to stay here and wait
till somebody come and get us.

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:18.580
They're not gonna come and get us.

01:04:18.754 --> 01:04:20.915
Oh, yes, they will.
- They are not gonna come.

01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:23.887
They don't give a shit about us.
They're gonna let us die.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.654
They don't care about us.

01:04:27.496 --> 01:04:30.260
Scott, we're gonna die.

01:04:31.133 --> 01:04:33.226
Oh, fuck.
- She's right.

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:35.029
Who was that?
- lt was the doctor.

01:04:35.204 --> 01:04:36.398
What?

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:38.567
I'm gonna kill you.
- I've been bit.

01:04:38.741 --> 01:04:39.901
You left us down there.

01:04:40.076 --> 01:04:41.668
Piece of shit.

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:43.778
I've been bitten.

01:04:44.413 --> 01:04:45.744
He's been bitten.

01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:47.940
He's been bitten. Get back.

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:49.412
Close those doors.

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:52.349
Somebody close
those fucking doors.

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:58.223
It won't hold him.

01:04:59.795 --> 01:05:01.763
It's not gonna hold him for long.

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:03.694
Get back.
- She's bleeding.

01:05:03.866 --> 01:05:05.201
She's bleeding.

01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:05.758
She's bleeding.

01:05:10.806 --> 01:05:12.273
Sadie.

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:14.599
No.

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:16.244
We have to kill her.

01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:18.744
No, no.

01:05:21.384 --> 01:05:24.581
Hey, hey, hey,
you're not gonna fucking touch her.

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.278
We gotta get out. Gotta get out.

01:05:26.455 --> 01:05:29.049
Gotta get out of here.
Gotta get out of here. Come on.

01:05:30.192 --> 01:05:31.420
Help me get out of here.

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:33.789
Let me get out of here, please.

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:36.056
Hey, hey.

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:38.564
Please. Hey.

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:40.929
Hey. Hey.

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:42.798
Please, get me--

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:44.337
Oh, my God.

01:05:44.507 --> 01:05:46.600
Sniper.

01:06:12.335 --> 01:06:13.996
Scott.

01:06:15.738 --> 01:06:19.174
They're not gonna let us out
of here alive, are they?

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:20.934
No.

01:06:21.844 --> 01:06:23.835
I don't think so.

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:29.782
There might be a way out.
- What?

01:06:29.952 --> 01:06:33.319
Jake, there might be a way out.

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:39.359
How? How do we get out of here?

01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:49.337
Listen, Jake.

01:06:49.505 --> 01:06:53.339
There is a drain cover in the basement
that joins up with the sewers.

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:57.468
We need the key, we need the key.
- The keys are in our apartment.

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:09.321
Come with us.

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:12.086
Come with us.
You have to come with us.

01:07:12.294 --> 01:07:14.524
I won't leave him. I can't leave him.

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:16.824
Leave him alone.

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:22.164
Oh, my God.

01:07:22.338 --> 01:07:24.772
We have to get out of here.
We have to get the key.

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:27.238
Key's in Yuri's apartment.
Know where he lives?

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:30.072
You made the list of residents.
Where does he live?

01:07:30.246 --> 01:07:31.736
I can't remember where it's at.

01:07:31.914 --> 01:07:34.212
You have to think about it.
Think, think, think.

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:36.180
I don't know, I don't know.
- Think.

01:07:36.352 --> 01:07:39.617
I don't know which apartment.
I don't know which apartment it is.

01:07:40.456 --> 01:07:42.390
Mailboxes, mailboxes.

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:44.321
Mailboxes.

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:58.433
Yeah, get the hammer.

01:07:58.607 --> 01:08:00.404
Grab the hammer.
- I got it, I got it.

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:02.771
Go.
- Keep moving.

01:08:03.345 --> 01:08:06.109
Oh, keep moving, man.
Keep moving.

01:08:06.282 --> 01:08:08.045
I'm coming.

01:08:20.395 --> 01:08:22.956
Where is it? Which one is it?

01:08:23.365 --> 01:08:24.423
Hurry.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.999
Yuri lvanov, 3B.

01:08:26.167 --> 01:08:27.499
Three. Get to the elevator.

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:30.161
Three. Oh, God.
- Oh, shit.

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:32.131
Get to the elevator.

01:08:32.308 --> 01:08:33.774
But the electricity?

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:36.673
It should run on auxiliary power.
We're good.

01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:39.404
She's cuffed. We can get by.

01:08:47.622 --> 01:08:50.591
Come on. Come on.

01:08:51.193 --> 01:08:53.388
Come on.

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:56.962
Oh, God.

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.292
Get in.

01:08:58.466 --> 01:09:01.800
Get in. Get in.

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:04.867
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.474
Close the fucking door.

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:10.946
Easy, easy.

01:09:10.946 --> 01:09:13.210
Easy, easy.

01:09:13.415 --> 01:09:16.042
But it's gonna stop at two.
We're gonna stop at two.

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:18.015
The light, the light.
- I'll get it.

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:20.484
I'm fixing it, come on.
- The light.

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:25.990
Come on. Come on,
you should get that hammer, Jake.

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:37.638
They won't close. They won't close.

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:47.706
It's go-- It's gonna go.

01:09:47.883 --> 01:09:49.850
Oh, it's gonna go.

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:00.893
Oh, shit.

01:10:01.063 --> 01:10:03.725
Scott.

01:10:03.899 --> 01:10:05.696
Scott.

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:07.392
Get off me.

01:10:11.507 --> 01:10:13.532
No.

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:37.497
Get up. Come on.

01:10:42.705 --> 01:10:44.263
Get up.

01:10:44.773 --> 01:10:46.434
Get up.

01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:00.050
Scott, I've been bitten.

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:01.951
I've been bitten.
- No, you haven't.

01:11:02.124 --> 01:11:03.386
No, you haven't. I saw it.

01:11:03.559 --> 01:11:04.992
I was bitten.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:08.095
Angie, Angie, they didn't get you.
You didn't get bitten.

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:10.129
Come on, Angie. Angie.
- I was bitten.

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:12.460
Look at me, Angie. Come on, baby.

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:15.160
Baby, come on, look at me.
- Man, let's go.

01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:16.998
Get off me. Look at me.
- No.

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:18.264
Let's get out of here.

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.998
You did not get bit.

01:11:20.175 --> 01:11:21.733
You did not get bit. Look at me.

01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:23.002
You did not get bit.

01:11:23.178 --> 01:11:24.440
Trust me. You did not.

01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:26.274
I saw it, I saw it.
- We have to go.

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:28.006
Let's go.
- No. Let's go, baby.

01:11:28.183 --> 01:11:31.153
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

01:11:43.999 --> 01:11:46.968
This is 3B right here. Right here.

01:11:51.006 --> 01:11:52.974
All clear.

01:11:56.478 --> 01:11:59.538
Keep the light on my hands, Scott.
- Okay.

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:01.774
Find them.
- I don't see it, I don't see.

01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:05.943
The light, the light, the light.
- I'm bringing it back to you.

01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:07.452
Nothing.

01:12:07.623 --> 01:12:08.954
I don't....

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:10.955
No, no, he wouldn't
leave them in there.

01:12:11.126 --> 01:12:12.855
Hey, he wouldn't leave them in there.

01:12:13.028 --> 01:12:14.154
Come on.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:15.797
Hurry.

01:12:15.964 --> 01:12:17.022
Find the keys.

01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:18.962
He's the one that-- Who's--?

01:12:19.134 --> 01:12:21.227
Go back to the desk.

01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:24.099
Yeah.
- Find them keys, baby.

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:31.870
Come on.

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:34.642
I got them,
but I don't know which one it is.

01:12:34.817 --> 01:12:36.216
I don't know.
- Take them all.

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:38.250
Which one is it, Scott?
- Take them all.

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:39.819
Come on.

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:45.653
Angela, Angela,
I need you to be quiet.

01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:49.195
We need to get three flights of stairs
down to the basement, okay?

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:51.333
I need you to stay tight.

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:54.060
I need you to stay close
and stay fast, okay?

01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:56.898
Are you ready? All right, all right.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:57.072 --> 01:12:58.334
Ready, Scott?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:12:58.507 --> 01:13:00.407
All right, all right.

01:13:02.177 --> 01:13:03.576
Okay. All right.

01:13:03.746 --> 01:13:05.509
All right, we can do this.
- Got it.

01:13:05.681 --> 01:13:07.444
We can do this, right, Angela?
- Yeah.

01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:09.207
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:10.852
Come on.

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:13.252
Ready. Come on.

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:15.652
Scott, come on. Come on, Scott.

01:13:23.799 --> 01:13:25.790
Angela, Angela, stop.

01:13:25.968 --> 01:13:27.799
Hey, we gotta go up. Come on.

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:30.939
Come on, run, run.

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:35.171
Get up there. Come on.

01:13:37.179 --> 01:13:39.477
Up. Go.

01:13:42.384 --> 01:13:44.249
Gonna be an old one. Oh, God.
- Go.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:47.480
It's gotta be an old one, Scott.
- I know, pick the key.

01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:49.316
Get in there.
- Light, light, light.

01:13:49.491 --> 01:13:51.482
I'm finding it, I'm finding it.
- Come on.

01:13:51.693 --> 01:13:53.388
Go, go, go.
- Scott, I got it.

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:57.430
Go, go, go.
- I got it.

01:14:04.406 --> 01:14:06.306
Lock it.
- I can't get it.

01:14:10.712 --> 01:14:12.907
Come on.
- I can't get it.

01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:15.082
Scott, I can't.

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:16.842
Just turn the light on.

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:19.283
Turn the light on.
- lt'll come back on.

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:21.514
I need the light on.
- lt will come back on.

01:14:21.723 --> 01:14:22.747
Oh, please.

01:14:22.925 --> 01:14:27.089
There we go, there we go,
there we go. Okay? Okay, listen.

01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:29.486
Listen, listen. They went away.

01:14:29.665 --> 01:14:33.157
I think they went away.
Oh, damn, damn.

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:35.132
Okay, so this place was locked up.

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:38.762
What that means, probably,
is there ain't nobody in here. No one.

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:41.307
Yeah, let's find a way out.

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:44.344
Oh, God. Come on.

01:14:44.513 --> 01:14:47.949
Oh, what is this place, Scott?

01:15:01.129 --> 01:15:04.895
Oh, please, keep the light on.
- I got you, I got you.

01:15:07.135 --> 01:15:09.035
What is this?

01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:18.244
Stay with me. Stay with me.

01:15:18.413 --> 01:15:19.710
Come on.

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:22.407
Come on. Come on, now.

01:15:23.852 --> 01:15:25.820
What is this?
- Oh, please.

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:30.551
What is this?
- I don't know, man.

01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:31.818
What is it?

01:15:31.994 --> 01:15:33.222
Oh, what is that?
- Please.

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:34.885
What is it?

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.658
What the hell?

01:15:45.407 --> 01:15:46.499
Oh, shit.

01:15:46.675 --> 01:15:49.007
Oh, God.
Oh, it's all the same kind of stuff.

01:15:49.177 --> 01:15:50.735
I don't understand it.

01:15:50.913 --> 01:15:52.676
Just stop.

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:54.375
Wait.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.950
Oh, God,
let's get out of here, please.

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:58.882
Okay, come on.
Come on, grab my hand.

01:15:59.054 --> 01:16:01.682
Grab my hand, it's me, it's me.
Look at it, look at it.

01:16:01.857 --> 01:16:03.722
Just come around this pole.
Let me lead.

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:05.416
Let me lead. I'm right with you.

01:16:05.594 --> 01:16:07.255
That's the way, okay?
Okay, come on.

01:16:07.429 --> 01:16:09.454
Oh, God, I don't--

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:12.532
Hey, hey, my bad, my bad.

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:14.197
Okay.

01:16:14.369 --> 01:16:15.961
Angela?

01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:19.630
We're gonna have to go
through that door.

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:27.648
I just need you to open it.

01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:29.476
You're gonna let me look in first.

01:16:29.651 --> 01:16:31.915
You just open it, okay?
- Yeah.

01:16:32.087 --> 01:16:33.952
Just push it and stand back.

01:16:34.122 --> 01:16:36.886
Stand back. Okay, okay.

01:16:37.059 --> 01:16:39.823
Come on, come on, Angie.
Angie, let's go in there.

01:16:39.995 --> 01:16:42.759
Please, get the light on me, okay?
- Come on.

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:46.327
Oh, this is so fucked. I don't know.

01:16:46.501 --> 01:16:48.366
Oh, damn.

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:54.008
Oh, shit, stick with me, stick with me.
Come on.

01:16:56.812 --> 01:16:58.143
Okay?

01:16:58.313 --> 01:17:02.079
Keep the light on, keep the light on.
- What is it?

01:17:03.418 --> 01:17:04.476
Okay.

01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:08.282
Okay, good? You gotta--

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:10.015
Shit.

01:17:10.659 --> 01:17:12.251
What is this?
- What?

01:17:12.427 --> 01:17:15.453
What is it? What the hell?

01:17:16.832 --> 01:17:17.992
What are you doing?

01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:21.158
Oh, Scott, what is this stuff?
- Okay.

01:17:23.405 --> 01:17:24.895
Okay.

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:27.938
Who is this? Who is this?

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:29.441
Oh, what is that?

01:17:29.611 --> 01:17:32.705
Is that a fucking...?

01:17:32.914 --> 01:17:34.609
Hey, play it.

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:38.946
I don't know what to do with it.

01:17:39.121 --> 01:17:40.611
That's it, come on.

01:17:50.732 --> 01:17:52.632
Hey, what is that?

01:18:21.997 --> 01:18:23.658
What was that?

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:30.098
I'll come to you.

01:18:30.272 --> 01:18:31.933
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:34.007
Hey, hey, hey.

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:37.036
Come on.
We don't know what's up there.

01:18:42.484 --> 01:18:44.884
Grab my hand, grab my hand.
- Okay.

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:47.980
Okay.

01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:52.021
Okay, I'm gonna take the camera.

01:18:52.194 --> 01:18:55.061
Listen to me, listen to me.
I'm gonna take the camera.

01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:57.198
I'm gonna take a look up there.
- No, no.

01:18:57.365 --> 01:18:58.764
Get up the door.
- No, no, no.

01:18:58.934 --> 01:19:01.630
We can't stay the fuck down here.
We can't stay here.

01:19:01.803 --> 01:19:04.067
I won't have a light
if you go up there.

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:06.707
Angie, Angie, stay with me.
- I'll be in the dark.

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:08.604
Angie, stay with me.

01:19:08.777 --> 01:19:10.438
Angie, stay with me.

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:13.706
Look, I'm gonna have
to take this light off you.

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:16.783
Here, grab my waist.
Okay, just grab my waist.

01:19:16.952 --> 01:19:18.510
Good.

01:19:43.912 --> 01:19:44.312
Scott, what happened?
What happened?

01:19:44.312 --> 01:19:45.677
Scott, what happened?
What happened?

01:19:45.847 --> 01:19:48.645
Oh, something hit the camera.
- Don't turn it off, fix it.

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:51.081
I'm trying. Damn it, I'm trying.
- Please.

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:52.311
I'm trying.

01:19:52.487 --> 01:19:54.648
Look, I'm gonna put
the night vision on.

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:57.553
I'll put the night vision on. Hold on.

01:19:58.293 --> 01:19:59.624
Just stay there, okay?

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:01.922
Okay, okay.
- Okay.

01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:03.989
Okay.

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:06.361
Okay. Okay, I can
see you now, okay?

01:20:06.568 --> 01:20:07.967
Okay.

01:20:09.171 --> 01:20:11.298
All right? Okay.

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:15.102
Yeah, yeah. Okay,
I'm gonna stick my hand out, okay?

01:20:15.277 --> 01:20:17.142
Okay, okay. Hey.

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:18.973
Relax, relax, it's me.

01:20:19.147 --> 01:20:21.115
Hey, it's me, it's me, it's me, okay?

01:20:21.283 --> 01:20:23.615
Okay, good. Come on, come on.

01:20:23.785 --> 01:20:25.446
Hey, you're doing good.
Come around.

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.349
Come around my back. Hold on.

01:20:27.522 --> 01:20:28.955
Hold on. We'll be okay, okay?

01:20:29.124 --> 01:20:32.116
I just gotta find us a way out of here.

01:20:32.294 --> 01:20:33.784
Okay? Okay.

01:20:33.962 --> 01:20:36.396
I'll find a way out, I promise.

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:41.901
Just give me a minute.

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:45.898
What's that? Stay still, stay still.

01:20:46.107 --> 01:20:47.404
Why? Why? Why?

01:20:47.609 --> 01:20:49.543
Get down. Get down.

01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:52.509
Don't make a sound.
Don't make a sound.

01:22:16.298 --> 01:22:18.266
It can't see us.

01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:22.494
If it can't hear us, it won't find us.

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:36.649
Okay, get ready.
We're gonna try to get by it.

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:50.795
Run.

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.667
Run.

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:14.912
Scott.
