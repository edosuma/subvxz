(PEOPLE SHOUTING)

00:35.662 --> 00:38.289
You made your point, now how about
letting us do our job?

00:38.415 --> 00:41.501
Our point will be made when your company
stops tearing down this mountain.

00:41.626 --> 00:43.420
Then who's gonna
feed our kids? You?

00:43.545 --> 00:44.713
If you really cared
about your kids,

00:44.838 --> 00:47.048
you'd want them to have air to breathe
when they grow up.

00:47.173 --> 00:48.633
What did you say,
you son of a bitch?

00:48.758 --> 00:50.719
You guys aren't
the problem.

00:50.844 --> 00:52.679
You're being hurt
more than anyone.

00:52.804 --> 00:54.431
You breathe in
that coal dust...

00:54.556 --> 00:56.725
Coal is the dirtiest
energy on Earth.

00:59.227 --> 01:00.562
Gonna need some backup.

01:00.687 --> 01:02.731
Not enough for you thugs to assault
the environment?

01:02.856 --> 01:04.107
Doug, please, don't.

01:06.776 --> 01:08.945
Susan? Susan, you okay?

01:13.366 --> 01:15.118
She needs to get
to a hospital.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.954
She's just dehydrated. We have medics
here. Let them give her fluids.

01:18.079 --> 01:19.247
She has no pulse.

01:20.749 --> 01:23.001
Either unhook your arm
or I'm gonna break it off.

01:23.126 --> 01:24.836
Either way,
this protest is over.

01:24.961 --> 01:26.921
The protest is over,
come on!

(MINERS SHOUTING)

All right.

01:34.721 --> 01:36.347
(MINERS CHEERING)

01:41.144 --> 01:42.979
- What happened?
- You passed out.

01:43.104 --> 01:45.815
It's okay.
Just dehydrated.

01:47.275 --> 01:50.570
You know we'll be back.
We'll be back!

02:03.541 --> 02:05.335
Hey, stop screwing around.

02:05.460 --> 02:07.670
I'm not screwing around.
I just can't...

02:14.552 --> 02:15.845
I can't stand up.

02:17.806 --> 02:19.098
(GRUNTS)

03:04.519 --> 03:06.062
I need to push back
our getaway.

03:06.229 --> 03:09.858
No, you don't. I found you a board,
perfect size to learn on.

03:09.983 --> 03:11.776
I'm just postponing.
O'Neil, from Philly General,

03:11.901 --> 03:13.736
wants me to get a patient
in to see House.

03:13.862 --> 03:14.696
So?

03:14.821 --> 03:16.030
I owe him a favor.

03:16.155 --> 03:18.741
He's taken about a dozen of my referrals
over the last year.

03:18.867 --> 03:22.203
I meant, so, that's five seconds
to hand House the file,

03:22.328 --> 03:24.581
30 for him to question
your real motives,

03:24.706 --> 03:25.790
a minute for witty comments

03:25.915 --> 03:28.585
comparing the length of your legs
to Thirteen's...

03:28.710 --> 03:29.752
Plenty of time left over
for the shore.

03:29.878 --> 03:32.005
I need to make sure he doesn't toss
the file in the trash

03:32.130 --> 03:33.339
as soon as
I'm out of sight.

03:33.464 --> 03:35.925
Babe, can't you repay the favor
on another case?

03:36.467 --> 03:39.429
After last week, I could really use
a break from this place.

03:39.554 --> 03:40.763
We both could.

03:41.347 --> 03:44.309
Once I'm sure
he's really on the case,

03:44.434 --> 03:45.894
then we're out of here.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.980
And these legs, and every other part
of me, will be all yours.

03:53.443 --> 03:55.695
He's seen three
different specialists.

03:55.820 --> 03:57.614
Interesting.

03:57.739 --> 04:00.408
Almost as interesting as you trying
to step into Kutner's shoes

04:00.533 --> 04:02.410
just days after
he stepped out of them.

04:02.535 --> 04:04.662
CAMERON: I am not
shoe shopping,

04:04.787 --> 04:06.873
I'm just trying to repay a favor
to his referring doctor.

04:06.998 --> 04:07.999
What's the mystery?

04:08.124 --> 04:11.711
The nutcase spends all his free time
wreaking havoc at toxic waste dumps.

04:11.836 --> 04:12.879
Tox screen's negative.

04:13.004 --> 04:16.049
No neurological, muscular or
cardiovascular abnormalities.

04:16.174 --> 04:18.760
The guy cares about the environment,
that makes him a nutcase?

04:18.885 --> 04:20.136
TAUB: He's a single guy
in his 20s,

04:20.261 --> 04:22.764
he cares about getting
his hybrid waxed by girls

04:22.889 --> 04:23.973
who care about
the environment.

04:24.098 --> 04:25.892
See? Not a nutcase.

04:26.017 --> 04:27.602
He's probably just faking
so he can sue the cops

04:27.727 --> 04:28.811
and get a six-figure
settlement.

04:28.937 --> 04:29.979
If he was trying
to fake an illness,

04:30.104 --> 04:33.399
why would he consent to be seen by the
best diagnostician in the country?

04:33.524 --> 04:36.527
Now look who's trying
to get her hybrid waxed.

04:36.653 --> 04:38.988
We need to do a vestibular
caloric test,

04:39.113 --> 04:41.699
see if the balance problem
starts above or below the neck.

04:41.824 --> 04:44.369
And when I say "we,"
I mean you.

04:44.494 --> 04:46.955
You're the one with a favor
to repay, not them.

04:53.586 --> 04:56.381
I'm going to be injecting ice-water
in your ear canal.

04:56.506 --> 04:58.716
If the resulting eye movements
are at all erratic,

04:58.841 --> 05:01.427
then the balance problem's
in your inner ear.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.888
Those in every room?

05:04.013 --> 05:04.973
I think so.

05:05.098 --> 05:09.018
Can you get rid of them?
Preferably from every room?

05:09.143 --> 05:12.230
They use over 30 pesticides
to grow commercial flowers.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.815
You'd think the medical industry
would be a lot more...

05:13.940 --> 05:15.191
Concerned with medicine?

05:15.316 --> 05:17.944
Let's fix your body, then you can
go back to fixing the Earth.

05:18.069 --> 05:19.028
This is gonna get
a little uncomfortable.

05:19.153 --> 05:21.280
I just spent 14 hours
chained to a tire.

05:21.406 --> 05:22.907
Most doctors
would recommend...

05:23.032 --> 05:24.701
Our planet's headed
for destruction.

05:24.826 --> 05:27.620
Coastlines underwater,
a million species extinct.

05:27.745 --> 05:31.416
Whoa! Feels like
I'm tumbling head over heels.

05:31.541 --> 05:33.960
It's normal. Sometimes
this test causes vertigo

05:37.046 --> 05:38.548
and nausea.

05:40.842 --> 05:43.511
Cameron just
brought me a case.

05:43.636 --> 05:45.680
Cameron is happy
in the ER.

05:45.805 --> 05:48.766
There's no way she wants her nose
back on your grindstone.

05:49.350 --> 05:52.562
Egg-white omelet, no bacon,
whole-wheat toast.

05:52.687 --> 05:54.856
I say it's not
my grindstone she's after,

05:54.981 --> 05:56.941
and not her nose
she wants on it.

05:57.066 --> 05:59.318
She and Chase are practically
living together.

06:01.654 --> 06:03.489
What did you just order?

06:03.614 --> 06:05.033
An omelet.

06:06.075 --> 06:08.202
Since when do you
pass on the swine?

06:08.995 --> 06:12.582
And wheat toast? Might as well eat
a sheet of sandpaper.

06:12.707 --> 06:15.877
Yes, but I don't like eating the
same thing two days in a row.

06:16.002 --> 06:18.713
Your bro's nurse
not loving the love handles?

06:18.838 --> 06:20.715
I'm just not
in the mood for bacon,

06:20.840 --> 06:23.259
and you are obviously trying to avoid
talking about Kutner,

06:23.384 --> 06:26.929
which is odd because you spent a whole
week obsessing about why...

06:27.055 --> 06:29.098
He's no longer
on my team.

06:29.223 --> 06:30.641
I'm sorry he's
no longer on my team.

06:30.767 --> 06:32.518
There's nothing else
to talk about.

06:34.228 --> 06:36.606
You're wearing the watch he gave you
for Secret Santa.

06:37.315 --> 06:39.650
Five functions,
including a stopwatch

06:39.776 --> 06:42.361
to time how long it takes you
to ask me if I'm okay.

06:43.362 --> 06:44.822
You gonna order?

06:46.866 --> 06:48.159
Not hungry.

06:52.163 --> 06:54.040
It's just weird.
She's brought cases before,

06:54.165 --> 06:55.875
but he's never made her
run the tests.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.795
Maybe he's looking for someone to mother
him after what happened.

06:58.920 --> 07:00.254
The only kind of
mothering House wants

07:00.379 --> 07:03.257
involves a bullwhip, leather diapers
and a credit card.

07:05.301 --> 07:06.677
Mommy's home.

07:09.764 --> 07:12.558
Test made the patient lose
his lunch, but his calorics are normal,

07:12.683 --> 07:14.894
his inner ear is fine
and he still can't balance himself.

07:15.019 --> 07:16.729
How many normal test
results do we need

07:16.854 --> 07:18.731
to know the patient's
a granola-filled phony?

07:18.856 --> 07:20.483
He's not lying
about his symptoms.

07:20.608 --> 07:21.692
And you know this
because...

07:21.818 --> 07:23.778
She changed her shoes.

07:23.903 --> 07:26.739
If he was faking, he'd have vomited
on the other side of the bed.

07:26.864 --> 07:30.827
Sparring with the police and chaining
yourself up for days can cause stress.

07:30.952 --> 07:32.537
Stress screws with
the heart and arteries.

07:32.662 --> 07:34.956
Carotid atherosclerosis
could cause a loss of balance.

07:35.081 --> 07:37.291
Wouldn't show up
on CT or MRI.

07:37.416 --> 07:40.294
It could also be our
only warning before a massive stroke.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.839
(SIGHS) Do a Holter
and a carotid doppler,

07:42.964 --> 07:45.716
see if his heart skips
for more than the Spotted Owl.

07:46.384 --> 07:50.429
Although I didn't
say "we," if I had...

08:01.941 --> 08:03.276
(HICCUPPING)

08:03.526 --> 08:05.903
Sorry if this is
screwing up the test.

08:06.028 --> 08:09.407
Been hiccupping a lot lately,
but not as bad as this.

08:09.532 --> 08:11.659
How much is a lot?
And how long is lately?

08:11.784 --> 08:13.786
It's been on and off
for about a week.

08:13.911 --> 08:15.830
Maybe a few hours a day.

08:15.955 --> 08:17.832
Did you tell the doctors
in Philly about it?

08:18.624 --> 08:20.877
They didn't seem to think
it was any big deal.

08:26.215 --> 08:28.134
Hey, so we're still
leaving tomorrow, aren't we?

08:28.259 --> 08:30.553
I'm not sure.

08:30.678 --> 08:33.848
The referring doctors didn't realize
that his hiccups were...

08:33.973 --> 08:35.016
HICCUPS?

08:35.474 --> 08:38.227
With this duration and intensity,
most likely pathological,

08:38.352 --> 08:40.062
and it could mean
it's serious.

08:41.147 --> 08:42.690
Are you avoiding me?

08:42.815 --> 08:43.941
No.

08:44.066 --> 08:45.902
So, I shouldn't be
at all concerned

08:46.027 --> 08:48.446
that you're treating another
doctor's patient for hiccups

08:48.571 --> 08:51.532
instead of going on
the vacation I spent a week planning?

08:54.327 --> 08:57.663
There is a reason I need to stay
with this case a while longer,

08:57.788 --> 09:00.875
but I can't tell you
what it is.

09:02.418 --> 09:06.797
So, you admit you lied to me,
now you're asking me to trust you.

09:08.299 --> 09:09.634
Yes.

09:13.512 --> 09:14.722
Okay-

09:24.232 --> 09:25.983
No sign of heart
or arterial problems,

09:26.108 --> 09:28.194
but he's been hiccupping
on and off for over a week.

09:28.319 --> 09:32.657
Nice. I'm hooked. You can get back
to your shift at the ER,

09:32.782 --> 09:35.243
except, as far as the ER is concerned,
you're on vacation, right?

09:35.368 --> 09:37.995
I postponed a trip because I'm concerned
about the patient.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.206
Explains why you ditched Chase
and came to the differentials,

09:40.331 --> 09:41.332
not why you ran
the tests.

09:41.457 --> 09:42.959
You told me to.

09:43.084 --> 09:44.001
Well, I'm not your boss,

09:44.126 --> 09:46.087
something you usually
take great pleasure in pointing out.

09:46.212 --> 09:49.257
Hey, you don't still
have the hots for me, do you?

09:50.633 --> 09:53.678
I care about the patient and I care
about the people who work on your team,

09:53.803 --> 09:55.221
they've been through
a lot lately.

09:55.346 --> 09:57.431
- I just thought I...
- Was Florence Nightingale

09:57.556 --> 09:59.725
and you're gonna nurse us back
to spiritual and mental oneness.

09:59.850 --> 10:02.478
That would make sense if we were having
this conversation a week ago.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.188
Think what you want,
that I'm here to get a job,

10:04.313 --> 10:06.232
that I'm here to wrap you
in swaddling clothes.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.528
Problem is, I think neither.
Because neither makes sense.

10:11.737 --> 10:14.949
The only thing
that does, doesn't.

10:21.622 --> 10:25.710
Pathological hiccups plus inability
to balance, go.

10:27.044 --> 10:28.796
What she said.

10:30.256 --> 10:31.424
Brain would connect the two.

10:31.674 --> 10:34.927
It could if Cameron
hadn't already CT'd his head.

10:35.052 --> 10:36.971
Empty as her
boyfriend's calendar.

10:37.096 --> 10:39.015
What does this have
to do with Chase?

10:39.140 --> 10:40.641
- Nothing.
- Not sure yet.

10:41.225 --> 10:43.185
Patient is
on a jihad against commercial flowers,

10:43.311 --> 10:44.645
he's picketed
several nurseries.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.731
Organophosphate poisoning
can cause both hiccups and...

10:46.856 --> 10:48.774
No GI problems,
no hypersalivation.

10:48.899 --> 10:50.943
It's possible it's not
connected to a protest.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.738
MS wouldn't show on the CT,
and his name is Swanson.

10:53.863 --> 10:56.866
Scandinavians have an increased
susceptibility to MS.

10:57.158 --> 10:59.035
Better theory than,
"He's faking it."

10:59.952 --> 11:03.372
The clogs have it.
Do a lumbar puncture to confirm MS.

11:06.751 --> 11:09.045
I guess we'll just
continue to twiddle our thumbs.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.964
God, I hope
that's a euphemism.

11:12.089 --> 11:13.257
How am I supposed to
do a lumbar puncture

11:13.382 --> 11:14.925
on a patient with
intractable hiccups?

11:15.051 --> 11:18.262
I'm trying to figure out
what that could be a euphemism for.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.015
You'll find a way.

(DOUG HICCUPPING)

11:27.980 --> 11:30.983
You're not worried House is gonna be
pissed you're helping me do the test?

11:31.108 --> 11:33.152
He said find a way,
and you did.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.280
How do you think
House is doing?

11:36.405 --> 11:37.823
That why you're here?

11:38.032 --> 11:39.325
Yeah.

11:40.451 --> 11:41.869
No, it isn't.

11:41.994 --> 11:45.122
Even if House was messed up
by Kutner's suicide, it wouldn't matter.

11:45.247 --> 11:48.334
He already thinks
life is nasty, brutish and long,

11:48.459 --> 11:51.003
and misery helps
his diagnostic skills.

11:51.128 --> 11:54.173
All of which you know,
so, why are you here?

11:54.298 --> 11:56.300
Which answer
would you believe?

11:56.425 --> 11:58.677
If you want Kutner's place,
it's fine by me.

11:58.803 --> 12:01.722
I could use someone else
with the stones to stand up to House.

12:01.847 --> 12:05.768
But you've got to know that's gonna blow
up your relationship with Chase.

12:06.352 --> 12:08.604
All I did was postpone
a three-day trip.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.606
With Chase,
to be with House.

12:11.816 --> 12:13.025
(HICCUPS)

12:14.527 --> 12:16.862
- What are you doing?
- Ordering IV chlorpromazine.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.656
This could still be
neurological.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.658
You can cloud
his mental status.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.868
You wanna get the needle in his spine
or you wanna talk?

12:30.835 --> 12:34.213
You and House been talking
about filling Kutner's slot?

12:34.338 --> 12:37.258
Yeah, we went straight
from the funeral to Human Resources.

12:39.552 --> 12:41.220
You interested
in getting back on the team?

12:41.345 --> 12:43.389
I'm interested in knowing
if Cameron's interested.

12:43.681 --> 12:46.475
She's been running
all the tests for House's case.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.853
Well, she hasn't said
anything to me.

12:48.978 --> 12:53.691
But I guess the referring doctor might
have asked her to keep an eye on him.

12:56.610 --> 12:59.071
Do you think Cameron's
in love with House?

12:59.738 --> 13:02.908
That is a ridiculous question.
She's in love with you.

13:04.618 --> 13:07.037
Are you in love
with House?

13:07.163 --> 13:10.666
That is an even more
ridiculous question.

13:11.834 --> 13:14.128
Two questions,
zero answers.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.756
I think I can
extrapolate from there.

13:31.687 --> 13:32.897
FRANNI: Dr. House?

13:33.647 --> 13:36.901
Sorry, I'm just
the zone delivery guy.

13:37.026 --> 13:39.528
I'm Doug Swenson's wife.

13:42.281 --> 13:45.075
His history said the environmental
kamikaze was single.

13:45.201 --> 13:47.661
He probably didn't
want me to worry.

13:47.786 --> 13:50.498
He told me he was in jail
with some of the other protesters.

13:50.623 --> 13:52.082
Yeah, well,
no worries there.

13:52.917 --> 13:57.755
He's in jail a lot.
Not so often in the hospital.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.591
I searched his e-mail, and I found
the referral to you yesterday.

14:00.716 --> 14:04.011
You must really love your husband,
and travel by rickshaw.

14:04.136 --> 14:06.263
Only took you 18 hours
to get here.

14:09.433 --> 14:13.729
Who eats kale? It's so bland
it doesn't even taste like kale.

14:14.271 --> 14:17.066
I had to find somebody to take care
of our 4-year-old son.

14:18.275 --> 14:19.735
Doug's all right,
isn't he?

14:19.860 --> 14:20.736
I have no idea.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.196
I know he's an idiot,

14:22.321 --> 14:25.282
and now I've learned that he's a liar,
so we're making...

14:27.409 --> 14:28.702
Who told you
that I was in here?

14:28.827 --> 14:32.206
The doctor in the office next to yours
said that you might be here.

14:39.421 --> 14:40.714
I got it figured out.

14:40.839 --> 14:42.758
That mean we don't
need to do the LP?

14:42.883 --> 14:45.678
I was talking to her.
You're not even supposed to be here.

14:45.803 --> 14:47.054
You want us to stop or not?

14:47.179 --> 14:50.057
What? I don't care
what you do with him.

14:50.182 --> 14:52.101
You're not doing a favor
for a doctor in Philly,

14:52.226 --> 14:55.020
you're doing a favor
for an oncologist in North Jersey.

14:55.145 --> 14:56.730
I'm spying on you
for Wilson?

14:56.855 --> 14:59.233
Spying, pre-emptive
grief counseling...

14:59.358 --> 15:02.111
Wilson sees you 10 times more than I do,
he's a better liar,

15:02.236 --> 15:04.780
and he wouldn't have
to cancel a vacation to do it.

15:05.781 --> 15:09.243
Good points. Also doesn't
explain the diet.

15:09.368 --> 15:11.704
What does any of this
have to do with my husband?

15:11.829 --> 15:13.163
Nothing.

15:13.831 --> 15:18.043
Meet Mrs. Environmental Nutbag, or did
you keep your maiden name?

15:18.168 --> 15:20.462
- He's married?
- Yep. Got a kid, too.

15:20.588 --> 15:22.840
Double threat,
ecu-freak and deadbeat dad.

15:23.007 --> 15:23.841
House!

15:23.966 --> 15:26.760
- Sorry, parentally challenged.
- No, his neck.

15:29.430 --> 15:31.807
It's torticollis,
reaction to the chlorpromazine.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.684
That's not just a spasm,
it's swollen.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.563
Crunchy.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.775
FOREMAN: It's definitely
not MS.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.153
Crunching sounds were caused by an air
leak between his lungs.

15:44.320 --> 15:45.154
CAMERON: The leak in his mediastinum

15:45.279 --> 15:46.780
could've been caused
by prolonged hiccups.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.157
More likely it was
the neck spasm.

15:48.282 --> 15:49.575
CAMERON: Most likely
it was there all along.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.827
We just didn't notice
until the other symptoms made it worse.

15:51.952 --> 15:55.122
So, what causes loss of balance,
pathological hiccups,

15:55.247 --> 15:57.124
and a hole in
his Gloria Steinem?

15:57.249 --> 15:59.335
He was protesting
a lumber mill last fall.

15:59.460 --> 16:01.337
Sarcoid's been linked
to pine forests.

16:01.462 --> 16:03.213
No, his AC levels are normal.

16:03.339 --> 16:05.132
THIRTEEN: Progressive
systemic sclerosis?

16:05.257 --> 16:07.009
Guy practically lives
in industrial waste sites.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.594
If a solvent got absorbed
through his lungs,

16:08.719 --> 16:11.347
caused
an autoimmune firestorm...

16:11.472 --> 16:14.350
Start him on IV methylprednisolone
for systemic sclerosis.

16:14.475 --> 16:16.101
Do a full work-up
to confirm.

16:16.226 --> 16:18.020
- By myself?
- Without yourself.

16:19.563 --> 16:22.691
Grab a bat.
Grab some pine.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.068
Time to bring in
the first string.

16:30.366 --> 16:31.533
Why?

16:32.076 --> 16:35.162
You obviously want to be here.
I can't figure out why.

16:35.287 --> 16:37.873
So I want to see where you go
when you can't be here.

17:00.521 --> 17:02.314
You know what vacation
means, right?

17:02.439 --> 17:04.817
You here because of House,
Chase, or overtime issues?

17:04.942 --> 17:08.904
He's very concerned.
Chase, not House.

17:09.029 --> 17:09.863
If it's all right
with you,

17:09.988 --> 17:12.449
I'd rather communicate with Chase
by communicating with Chase.

17:16.537 --> 17:18.205
Are you in love
with House?

17:20.082 --> 17:24.086
You are not
concerned about me.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.754
You're marking
your territory.

17:26.630 --> 17:28.799
You shouldn't be
involved with House,

17:28.924 --> 17:30.592
neither should I,
neither should anyone.

17:32.261 --> 17:36.056
You and Chase are good together.
Don't screw it up.

17:42.730 --> 17:44.356
FRANNI: When are you
gonna stop this?

17:44.481 --> 17:45.774
How can you
ask me to stop?

17:46.150 --> 17:48.986
You're in a hospital.
You have a son.

17:50.195 --> 17:52.990
The steroids ought to get him
breathing normally again.

17:53.115 --> 17:55.409
But autoimmune diseases
are serious.

17:55.534 --> 17:58.704
Might not be a bad idea to take
some time at home, rest up.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.039
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I can't just quit.

18:02.708 --> 18:04.793
Do you hate us
that much?

18:04.918 --> 18:07.796
I love you,
and I love our son.

18:09.381 --> 18:12.134
But why should he matter more
than everyone else's?

18:12.801 --> 18:13.802
He does.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.012
Why?

18:15.971 --> 18:19.016
Because he's biologically
connected to me?

18:19.141 --> 18:21.435
There's no rational reason.

18:22.394 --> 18:23.812
He's our son.

18:24.772 --> 18:29.526
And he's going to need to drink clean
water and breathe clean air.

18:30.986 --> 18:32.780
I'm doing this
for him, too.

18:37.034 --> 18:38.660
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

18:41.830 --> 18:43.791
Come on in, House.

18:45.834 --> 18:48.378
Because who else is it going to be
at 10:30 at night?

18:48.504 --> 18:50.589
And, no, thanks,
I already ate.

18:50.714 --> 18:53.091
I didn't ask you
to dinner.

18:53.217 --> 18:54.635
But you were going to.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.179
And when I explained
that I'd eaten hours ago,

18:57.304 --> 18:59.765
you were going to move on
to your real entree,

18:59.890 --> 19:01.725
rifling through
my kitchen.

19:05.813 --> 19:06.647
Hmm.

19:06.772 --> 19:09.066
Inviting me to
search your kitchen.

19:09.191 --> 19:10.734
Means you know
that I'd find nothing,

19:10.859 --> 19:12.694
or you know that
I'd find something,

19:12.820 --> 19:16.073
so you're hoping that I'm gonna assume
the former and I won't bother to look.

19:17.741 --> 19:21.537
Or it means it's late,
I'm tired,

19:21.662 --> 19:24.081
I know you're here
to advance some paranoid theory

19:24.206 --> 19:26.959
based on a single egg-white omelet,
and I'd like to get it over with

19:27.084 --> 19:28.335
so we can both
go to sleep.

19:28.460 --> 19:29.795
Your single-omelet theory

19:29.920 --> 19:33.841
conveniently overlooks the grassy knoll
you had for lunch today,

19:33.966 --> 19:36.009
a vegetable
and grain gag-a-thon.

19:36.593 --> 19:39.555
The Warren Commission found no evidence
of a second lunch,

19:39.680 --> 19:42.307
possibly because it was stolen
from the doctors' lounge.

19:42.432 --> 19:44.351
You're not getting
any fatter,

19:44.476 --> 19:46.562
your medical records
were clean.

19:46.687 --> 19:47.855
You checked my...

19:47.980 --> 19:51.233
You're alone tonight,
so it's Kutner.

19:53.318 --> 19:55.654
How could Kutner
have any conceivable...

19:55.779 --> 19:57.865
Your patients live,
your patients die,

19:57.990 --> 20:00.951
you float above it all
like a medical colossus.

20:01.076 --> 20:02.536
But a fellow doctor dies...

20:02.661 --> 20:03.829
That's brilliant.

20:03.954 --> 20:06.665
Kutner was a wake-up call
that if I didn't eat healthier,

20:06.790 --> 20:08.792
I might kill myself.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.836
Mortality is mortality.

20:12.170 --> 20:16.842
And ice cream
is ice cream.

20:16.967 --> 20:21.471

Quadruple-fat content.

20:24.683 --> 20:27.769
Stuff you haven't eaten
just proves you haven't eaten it.

You were hoping
for evidence of stuff I have eaten?

(DOUG SCREAMING)

20:38.447 --> 20:40.157
Excruciating pain
in his left leg.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.783
Acute onset,
about 10 minutes ago.

20:41.909 --> 20:43.827
What are you
doing to him?

20:44.578 --> 20:48.206
I assume they were checking
for vascular pulsation.

20:48.332 --> 20:50.208
Either it's negative
or he's a big wuss.

20:50.334 --> 20:51.960
It's not a tumor
or an aneurysm.

20:53.795 --> 20:55.255
Metabolic bone disease?

20:55.380 --> 20:56.590
Bone density's normal.

20:56.715 --> 20:58.884
But the bone covering
might not be.

20:59.009 --> 21:02.471
If it's osteomyelitis, an infection
eating away at his periosteum...

21:02.596 --> 21:05.307
Explains the pain. Odds are it's
a subclinical infection

21:05.432 --> 21:06.934
that we made worse
with the steroids we gave him.

21:07.601 --> 21:11.772
Start him on IV antibiotics, x-ray
his legs to confirm osteomyelitis.

21:11.897 --> 21:13.982
Cameron's already
done a full set of lower body x-rays.

21:14.274 --> 21:17.194
Infection obviously flared,
do them again.

changed my diet,

could I have for hiding it from you?

21:33.627 --> 21:35.963
Ankle, tibia, fibula,

No inflammation,
no signs of osteo.

Last week, it did.

You want to date men,
good chance talking won't be...

22:15.752 --> 22:17.004
His femur's fractured.

22:17.129 --> 22:19.423
That's impossible. It's the hardest bone
in the body.

22:19.548 --> 22:21.299
And he broke it
lying in bed.

22:28.890 --> 22:32.310
How can you have a broken femur
without so much as a bruise?

22:32.436 --> 22:34.521
Whatever broke it
had to do it from within.

22:34.646 --> 22:36.398
Osteogenesis imperfecta?

22:36.523 --> 22:37.941
Brittle bones
wouldn't cause hiccups,

22:38.066 --> 22:40.527
plus we'd have seen
abnormal coloring in the sclerae.

22:40.652 --> 22:41.945
Which leaves cancer.

22:42.070 --> 22:43.947
Since when does bone cancer
cause hiccups?

22:44.072 --> 22:45.907
Which means it's
not bone cancer.

22:46.033 --> 22:47.951
Or it's not cancer.

22:48.076 --> 22:51.204
House is right. It'd be hard to find
a guy outside Chernobyl

22:51.329 --> 22:53.373
who'd been exposed
to more carcinogens,

22:53.498 --> 22:56.043

nuclear waste sites.

22:57.627 --> 22:59.463
Tell Chase to
repair the break.

23:48.845 --> 23:52.265

question is, why do you care?

You're not even sure
that it's...

23:53.934 --> 23:56.228
What I mean is,
why do you care from here?

23:56.353 --> 23:57.813
You can monitor
the patient from home.

23:57.938 --> 23:59.064
What's the difference
between here and home?

24:04.319 --> 24:05.403
Hmm.

24:05.529 --> 24:08.156
There's less medical equipment,
more training bras,

24:08.281 --> 24:11.076
and more
Vegemite sandwiches.

24:11.201 --> 24:13.787
Actually, technically,
right now Chase is here,

24:13.912 --> 24:15.914
but that's because I called him
and you didn't know that,

24:16.039 --> 24:20.919
and it's irrelevant to my point,
which is you and Chase are over.

24:22.629 --> 24:23.964
You are wrong.

24:24.089 --> 24:28.051
You decided that his single drawer
of clothes is one drawer too many.

24:28.176 --> 24:29.469
But you don't have
the guts to tell him,

24:29.594 --> 24:34.766
so you're emotionally walking away
instead of actually walking away,

24:34.891 --> 24:38.103
which is stupid because only one
of those is good for your heart.

24:45.569 --> 24:47.737
He's gonna ask me
to marry him.

24:49.906 --> 24:53.994
I was looking for
some thick socks, found the ring.

24:56.872 --> 24:58.582
And you want to say no.

24:58.707 --> 25:01.626
So I circle right back
to his single drawer of clothes...

25:01.751 --> 25:04.504
I don't want to say anything.
I don't want him to ask.

25:06.506 --> 25:07.883
Not now.

25:09.467 --> 25:13.930
Kutner... We're all
a little freaked out.

25:14.806 --> 25:17.517
We go home, we just want
to hug someone.

25:17.642 --> 25:19.936
We just want to know
everything's gonna be okay.

25:23.940 --> 25:26.985
I don't want him to propose
just because he's scared.

25:29.988 --> 25:30.864
Oh.

25:39.539 --> 25:42.334
She's got a headache, fever,
she's completely exhausted.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.753
Tell him about
your chest, honey.

25:44.878 --> 25:47.505
Her breasts
are really tender.

25:49.382 --> 25:51.843
You guys have a hot tub?

25:51.968 --> 25:52.802
No.

25:52.928 --> 25:54.179
So you must go
to the gym a lot?

25:54.304 --> 25:55.555
Not in years.

25:56.723 --> 26:00.268
But maybe when you
travel on business, you zip on down

26:00.393 --> 26:02.145
to that complimentary
hotel spa.

26:02.270 --> 26:03.355
No.

26:03.813 --> 26:05.482
Sorry, did you
just say yes?

26:05.690 --> 26:07.192
What the hell is
wrong with her?

26:07.317 --> 26:08.568
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

26:09.236 --> 26:10.237
Got a minute?

26:10.362 --> 26:12.030
He doesn't.
What's wrong with her?

26:12.489 --> 26:15.116
Sorry, I'm sure she's
got a medical crisis,

26:15.283 --> 26:18.495
and I need more time to figure out some
leading questions for your wife.

26:20.330 --> 26:21.665
What's going on
with Cameron?

26:21.790 --> 26:24.709
She doesn't want back on my team,
and she doesn't want to jump me.

26:26.670 --> 26:28.171
Okay-

26:28.296 --> 26:29.631
What?

26:31.007 --> 26:34.719
You ask a question, I rule out two
possibilities, and you're satisfied?

26:36.304 --> 26:37.931
That means you don't
want an answer,

26:38.056 --> 26:40.684
you just wanted to know
there wasn't a particular answer.

26:40.809 --> 26:42.811
Either you were worried
that she wanted back on my team

26:42.936 --> 26:45.522
or you were worried
she wanted back on me.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.565
This isn't
a medical crisis, is it?

26:49.192 --> 26:52.362
Could be. A lot of STDs
hang in the balance.

26:59.202 --> 27:01.913
I give up.
Vinegar compresses four times a day.

27:02.539 --> 27:04.791
Any chance I could
just leave it at that?

27:06.668 --> 27:09.587
No. Pseudomonas folliculitis.

27:09.713 --> 27:12.966
It's a skin infection from
crowded and contaminated hot tubs,

27:13.091 --> 27:16.553
which you obviously use,
but not with your husband.

27:19.055 --> 27:21.141
Tried to help
a sister out.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.773
The nuclei were
all normal-sized,

27:28.898 --> 27:30.984
bone cells are
well-differentiated.

27:31.109 --> 27:33.028
No dysplasia means
no cancer.

27:33.153 --> 27:34.571
That's good, isn't it?

27:34.696 --> 27:35.739
We hope so,

27:35.864 --> 27:38.742
although it also means we still
have no idea what caused the break.

27:38.950 --> 27:40.368
How does it feel?

27:40.493 --> 27:41.578
It hurts.

27:45.790 --> 27:47.042
Is it supposed
to look like that?

27:47.167 --> 27:50.462
No, but it's probably just residual
bleeding from the surgery.

27:50.587 --> 27:52.088
We should be able to...

27:57.010 --> 27:58.887
Need two units of FFP,
right away.

27:59.012 --> 28:00.347
Oh, my God.
What's happening?

28:00.472 --> 28:01.556
He's bleeding out.

28:06.644 --> 28:08.063
Means it's gotta
be cancer.

28:08.188 --> 28:10.523
It's gotta be, except it's not.
The biopsy was negative.

28:10.648 --> 28:12.525
Biopsies can be wrong,
symptoms can't.

28:12.650 --> 28:13.818
All signs point to cancer,

28:13.943 --> 28:16.446
but you can't blast a cancer
you can't find.

28:16.571 --> 28:20.575
Sure you can. Prep him for
total-body irradiation.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.619
You do realize
that's insane.

28:22.911 --> 28:25.914
Not unless you think the cancer's
cleverly hiding outside his body.

28:26.039 --> 28:27.457
Steroids already weakened
his immune system.

28:27.582 --> 28:30.251
That much radiation will kill him
before it kills the cancer.

28:30.377 --> 28:32.420
And if he doesn't have cancer,
we could cause one,

28:32.545 --> 28:34.214
or destroy his
immune system altogether.

28:34.339 --> 28:35.882
The guy could die
from an infected toenail.

28:36.049 --> 28:38.218
So you'd rather do nothing,
just let him die on his own?

28:38.343 --> 28:39.844
I'd rather make
his cancer worse.

28:43.556 --> 28:47.018
Give him insulin-like growth factor,
make any tumor or malignancy grow.

28:47.143 --> 28:48.978
Grows big enough,
we can find it.

28:49.145 --> 28:50.647
That's like pouring
gasoline on a fire.

28:50.772 --> 28:52.941
At least total-body irradiation
is an actual treatment.

28:56.569 --> 28:59.364
His idea is better.
Pour away.

29:14.963 --> 29:16.714
I've lost my mojo.

29:17.757 --> 29:19.801
Have you retraced
your steps?

29:19.926 --> 29:21.719
Does your cleaning lady
check your pockets before...

29:21.845 --> 29:25.723
I was clueless about Kutner,
I was wrong about Cameron,

29:26.766 --> 29:30.770
Taub just came up with an idea that I
should have seen long before he did.

29:30.895 --> 29:33.314
No one saw anything
coming with Kutner,

29:33.440 --> 29:35.066
you hardly ever see
Cameron anymore,

29:35.191 --> 29:38.778
and you hired Taub to come up with ideas
that you wouldn't have come up with.

29:38.903 --> 29:41.489
And I have no idea
why you're eating carrots.

29:41.614 --> 29:42.782
Good.

29:43.491 --> 29:46.828
I'm losing my mind,
all you got to say is, "Good"?

29:46.953 --> 29:49.706
House, a guy you worked
with for two years, who you mentored,

29:49.831 --> 29:53.293
and, yes, possibly even cared about,
just blew his brains out.

29:54.294 --> 29:56.713
You can't find the reason,
can't find the meaning in it,

29:56.838 --> 29:58.006
because sometimes
there isn't any.

29:58.131 --> 30:01.217
Sometimes
this is all there is.

30:02.302 --> 30:03.887
You should be losing it.

30:04.012 --> 30:06.890
You'd be crazy
not to be off your game.

30:07.015 --> 30:08.725
But your mojo's
right where you left it.

30:09.225 --> 30:11.436
Just keep playing with it.

30:12.395 --> 30:15.523
I gotta go.
Help yourself.

30:20.820 --> 30:22.614
I know this is
a tough process.

30:22.739 --> 30:25.200
At the first sign
of any tumors or masses we can...

30:25.325 --> 30:27.118
Start saying prayers?

30:27.243 --> 30:29.787
- It's gonna be okay. Once we can...
- No, it is not gonna be okay.

30:29.913 --> 30:31.414
You're growing
his cancer.

30:31.539 --> 30:33.416
This isn't
the doctors' fault.

30:34.250 --> 30:38.713
I've exposed myself to a lot
of bad stuff. I knew the risks.

30:39.631 --> 30:41.382
(WHEEZING)

30:41.758 --> 30:45.136
I want my life
to mean something,

30:45.261 --> 30:47.055
and if that means
I'm destined to...

30:48.932 --> 30:50.808
(EKG ALARM BLARING)

30:50.934 --> 30:53.436
He's in V-tach, and no pulse.
Grab the paddles.

30:53.561 --> 30:54.854
Oh, God.

30:57.774 --> 30:59.692
Charging. Clear.

31:00.777 --> 31:02.487
Charging. Clear.

31:05.782 --> 31:08.076
I've been looking for you.

31:08.201 --> 31:10.286
And I've been
thinking about you.

31:11.955 --> 31:15.750
Just hadn't reached
the looking stage yet.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.252
Which is the problem.

31:19.087 --> 31:22.257
You asked for a day,
I gave you two.

31:22.382 --> 31:26.094
You told me you had a secret you
couldn't share, I respected that.

31:26.219 --> 31:27.554
Now I don't know
what's worse,

31:27.679 --> 31:29.764
blowing off our vacation
to hang around House,

31:29.889 --> 31:32.183
or continuing to blow it off when
he won't hang around you.

31:32.308 --> 31:33.893
If you think I'm the
least bit interested in House...

31:34.018 --> 31:36.521
I don't know what
I'm supposed to think.

31:37.647 --> 31:39.983
I know this looks bad and...

31:40.108 --> 31:42.986
I don't care how it looks,
I care what it is.

31:43.111 --> 31:45.321
And you're not
telling me what it is.

31:45.446 --> 31:47.782
I'm trying
to trust you, but...

31:52.203 --> 31:53.371
I just...

31:57.083 --> 31:58.960
I need a little more time.

32:02.880 --> 32:03.923
No.

32:05.842 --> 32:10.471
This has nothing
to do with House.

32:10.597 --> 32:15.893
Yeah, well, it has nothing to do
with me either, not anymore.

32:21.816 --> 32:24.694
Let me know
when I can come pick up my things.

32:41.127 --> 32:43.129
TAUB: Nothing on the echo.
We drew a troponin level,

32:43.254 --> 32:44.964
no signs of
myocardial ischemia.

32:45.089 --> 32:46.257
All the tests were normal.

32:47.550 --> 32:51.763
Loss of balance, pathological hiccups,
air leak between the lungs,

32:51.929 --> 32:55.016
broken femur,
now tachycardia. Go.

32:59.270 --> 33:01.522
Come on, give me something.
Give me a bad idea,

33:01.648 --> 33:03.483
maybe I can turn it
into a good one.

33:10.198 --> 33:13.576
Fine. Open him up,
put in a defibrillator.

33:13.701 --> 33:15.036
FOREMAN: That's permanent
and risky.

33:15.161 --> 33:17.455
We don't even know what,
if anything, is wrong with his heart.

33:17.580 --> 33:18.748
Redo all the tests.

33:18.873 --> 33:22.460
In the meantime, open him up,
put in a defibrillator,

33:22.585 --> 33:25.296
so he can live long enough
for you to finish the tests.

33:40.061 --> 33:44.190
Balance organs, nerves,
lungs, bones, heart.

33:45.483 --> 33:49.278
Things you use
to make bratwurst?

33:49.404 --> 33:51.948
There's no sign
of infection,

33:52.073 --> 33:54.742
it's not a metabolic
or autoimmune disease.

33:54.867 --> 33:57.370
It's definitely not cancer.
I think.

33:57.495 --> 33:58.830
Definitely not cancer.

34:01.791 --> 34:03.292
Aren't you gonna pick?

34:03.418 --> 34:05.378
I'm thinking.
ls there a ticking clock?

34:06.295 --> 34:09.298
You already
put your money in.

34:09.424 --> 34:11.467
You never do that
until you decide.

34:11.592 --> 34:12.760
That's very observant of you.

34:12.885 --> 34:13.886
Too bad you distracted me.

34:14.011 --> 34:17.473
Now I'm thinking I might
change my mind.

34:20.977 --> 34:22.603
There's nothing healthy
in that machine.

34:22.729 --> 34:24.397
No, there's not.

34:29.235 --> 34:33.197
Gummi Bears.
You hate Gummi Bears.

34:35.158 --> 34:36.576
People can change.

34:36.701 --> 34:38.077
No.

34:38.202 --> 34:39.871
And more importantly,
I hate them.

34:39.996 --> 34:42.665
Oh, fine.
Then I won't offer you any.

34:45.668 --> 34:47.670
You manipulative bitch.

34:48.880 --> 34:52.008
You're not suddenly
eating healthy because you want to.

34:52.133 --> 34:55.344
You're eating healthy
because you know I don't want to.

34:55.470 --> 34:58.347
I've been mooching food
for 10 years,

34:58.473 --> 35:02.435
so either something started bothering
you this week or you're...

35:02.560 --> 35:06.105
Screwing with you.
It needed to be done.

35:07.064 --> 35:10.568
After Amber died, I withdrew,
tried to change everything,

35:10.693 --> 35:13.488
hoping I'd sort it out,
find some deeper truth.

35:13.613 --> 35:14.739
It was a mistake.

35:15.114 --> 35:17.408
I should have gone back
to normal, to here and now.

35:17.533 --> 35:19.994
Because that's all
we can ever really count on.

35:21.704 --> 35:23.873
Things need to get back
to normal in your life.

35:23.998 --> 35:28.211
And what could be more normal
than me screwing with you,

35:28.336 --> 35:29.879
and you figuring it out?

35:31.589 --> 35:33.216
You manipulative bitch.

35:50.149 --> 35:52.527
TAUB: We need to put in
a cardioverter defibrillator.

35:52.652 --> 35:55.655
It'll keep your heart beating
while we keep looking.

35:55.780 --> 35:56.656
What does that mean?

35:56.781 --> 35:59.951
It means, even if
we figure this out,

36:00.076 --> 36:04.413
you'll have to stop protesting anywhere
not near a hospital.

36:06.749 --> 36:09.669
Hi. Got a few questions.

36:09.836 --> 36:11.796
We're about to
start doing...

36:11.921 --> 36:13.965
A hopefully pointless
medical procedure.

36:14.090 --> 36:18.177
Your life and my mojo
hang in the balance.

36:18.302 --> 36:22.640
Pesticides are evil, which means that
commercial flowers are doused in evil,

36:22.765 --> 36:26.227
but plant life is
nature's answer to evil.

36:26.978 --> 36:28.604
So you have a garden.

36:28.729 --> 36:30.565
No. We live in
an apartment.

36:32.608 --> 36:35.152
- A window box then?
- No.

36:36.821 --> 36:37.864
Potted plants?

36:37.989 --> 36:39.615
Nothing.
The commercial growers...

36:39.740 --> 36:40.992
Yeah, they're evil.
Yeah, got it.

36:41.200 --> 36:44.245
House, I really don't think
we have time for this.

36:46.914 --> 36:48.708
Your marriage sucks.

36:51.002 --> 36:52.211
Thank you.

36:53.004 --> 36:55.464
All marriages suck.
Your marriage sucks.

36:55.590 --> 36:57.174
- No.
- I love her.

36:57.925 --> 37:00.303
He loves a tree in Oregon
more than he loves you,

37:00.428 --> 37:02.096
but he can't have
sex with it.

37:02.221 --> 37:04.390
Unless it's
that slutty oak outside Portland.

37:04.515 --> 37:06.392
You want to get
to your point?

37:06.517 --> 37:07.810
She's had enough.

37:07.935 --> 37:10.938
She's gonna leave, maybe she's just
not putting out, whatever.

37:11.063 --> 37:13.190
You gotta make it right.
Right away.

37:13.316 --> 37:16.694
You gotta compromise
that precious flower principle.

37:18.029 --> 37:19.322
Never.

37:21.991 --> 37:22.867
Once.

37:27.747 --> 37:30.625
Three weeks ago.
Our anniversary.

37:30.750 --> 37:33.210
I missed the dinner
to be at that rally.

37:33.336 --> 37:37.214
You planned it for months.
You were mad, really mad.

37:38.132 --> 37:42.303
I bought you flowers.
I brought them home.

37:42.428 --> 37:44.597
You were gone,
so was your suitcase.

37:46.015 --> 37:48.225
I tossed them,
bought you the earrings.

37:49.352 --> 37:50.436
Roses?

37:53.940 --> 37:55.316
Yes.

37:55.441 --> 37:58.235
You have sporotrichosis.

37:58.361 --> 38:00.571
It's an infection
from the thorn of the rose,

38:00.696 --> 38:04.659
which by any other name
is still a cheap marital aid.

38:04.784 --> 38:06.202
The flowers are
what gave me...

38:06.327 --> 38:09.288
Lesion on your eighth
cranial nerve knocks out your balance,

38:09.413 --> 38:12.375
another on your phrenic nerve
gives you serial hiccups.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.543
We then spread it to your bones
and heart with steroids

38:14.669 --> 38:16.504
and insulin-like
growth factor.

38:16.629 --> 38:18.631
Please tell us that
this is good news.

38:19.382 --> 38:21.217
It's good news for him,

38:21.342 --> 38:23.469
it's good news for
future generations.

38:23.594 --> 38:26.722
It's crappy news for you.
He's gonna be fine.

38:27.390 --> 38:29.350
And he'll never
doubt himself again.

38:37.900 --> 38:39.193
There you go.

38:43.656 --> 38:45.992
Damn. I was hoping
to interrupt something.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.789
Your favor's repaid,
patient's cured.

38:52.373 --> 38:55.418
He's already packing for another
Earth Day extravaganza next week.

38:55.543 --> 38:58.337
He almost died. He can't take a few days
at home with his family?

38:58.462 --> 39:02.633
People only change after a trauma if
they wanted to change before the trauma.

39:02.758 --> 39:05.636
Or if they've watched too many
After School Specials.

39:05.761 --> 39:06.929
You talking about Chase?

39:07.054 --> 39:08.222
I'm talking about you.

39:09.473 --> 39:11.392
You lost husband number one,

39:11.517 --> 39:13.310
no surprise that the death
of a colleague

39:13.436 --> 39:16.439
would make you question
another long-term lease.

39:16.564 --> 39:17.898
You teaching
commitment classes?

39:18.024 --> 39:19.483
'Cause I thought
you were too busy with your lecture...

39:19.608 --> 39:21.277
I'm sure that was
going to be hysterical.

39:21.402 --> 39:22.445
Let me just give you
the Cliff Notes.

39:22.570 --> 39:25.948
Don't try to dump him
by dumping cases on me.

39:26.073 --> 39:29.118
I told you, I never
wanted to dump Chase.

39:29.243 --> 39:31.454
Absolutely.
You wanted him to dump you.

39:31.579 --> 39:34.457
It's totally different,
much less guilt.

39:34.582 --> 39:37.501
Either way, you're out
of reasons to avoid him.

39:39.045 --> 39:41.380
Kutner was a pretty
dumb one to begin with.

39:48.971 --> 39:50.890
I should never have
postponed our vacation.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.145
I should never
have planned it.

39:59.940 --> 40:01.901
I found the ring
in your sock.

40:08.949 --> 40:12.161
I didn't want you to propose
out of some sort of knee-jerk reaction

40:12.286 --> 40:13.662
to what happened
to Kutner.

40:16.791 --> 40:18.751
Well, I guess you don't have
to worry about that anymore.

40:18.876 --> 40:20.503
I'm not. I...

40:22.713 --> 40:26.467
I don't care how it happens,
I just want it to happen.

40:31.305 --> 40:33.099
Are you proposing to me?

40:33.933 --> 40:37.228
I'm proposing that

40:39.271 --> 40:40.815
you propose to me.

40:41.774 --> 40:45.694
After I broke up with you?
After you ruined my planned proposal?

40:45.820 --> 40:46.821
You expect me to...

40:46.946 --> 40:48.531
I'm not expecting.

40:50.574 --> 40:52.159
I'm hoping.

40:56.539 --> 40:57.915
(SIGHS)

41:20.938 --> 41:22.106
Yes.

41:22.273 --> 41:24.275
(HOUSE PLAYING JAZZ ON PIANO)

42:55.783 --> 42:57.868
Solved another case,

42:59.036 --> 43:00.829
busted Wilson.

43:03.707 --> 43:07.044
Looks like you're not
losing it after all.
