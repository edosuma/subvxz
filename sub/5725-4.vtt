WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:03.471
(panting)

00:08.409 --> 00:10.544
And the evil witch
peered inside the oven

00:10.578 --> 00:13.681
and that's when Gretel pushed
her in and locked the door.

00:13.714 --> 00:16.350
And then Hansel and Gretel
were free.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.486
No, Dad,
you're telling it wrong.

00:18.519 --> 00:19.653
Excuse me?

00:22.223 --> 00:24.625
Gretel locked the oven.

00:24.658 --> 00:27.495
The evil witch screamed!

00:27.528 --> 00:29.130
The flames

00:29.163 --> 00:31.632
melted her face off.

00:31.665 --> 00:34.368
Her bones were

00:34.402 --> 00:35.769
sticking out.

00:35.803 --> 00:38.806
And her guts were hanging.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.610
And then...

00:42.643 --> 00:44.512
she died.

00:44.545 --> 00:45.546
Michelle.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.614
(laughs)

00:46.647 --> 00:47.781
Really?
What?

00:47.815 --> 00:49.850
That's the way Grandpa tells it.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.353
Grandpa and I are gonna
have to have a little chat.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.657
Will you ask him
something for me?

00:56.690 --> 00:58.526
Sure. What do you
want me to ask him?

00:58.559 --> 01:00.428
Is he mad at me?

01:01.862 --> 01:03.597
Why-why would he be mad at you?

01:04.632 --> 01:06.300
I don't know.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.602
He hasn't come over in a while.

01:11.205 --> 01:13.207
Um...

01:20.148 --> 01:21.782
Grandpa's sick.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.751
What kind of sick?

01:25.153 --> 01:27.388
The kind of sick that...

01:27.421 --> 01:28.889
it just, it makes it
hard for him

01:28.922 --> 01:30.758
to do the things
that he used to.

01:30.791 --> 01:34.262
We should bring him
Mom's chicken soup.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.630
That'll make him better.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.784
I couldn't get anything off
this phone, Agent Pierce.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.786
We need Daniel Krumitz.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.758
KRUMITZ:
Sausage, onions.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.695
olives, jalapenos.

02:07.728 --> 02:10.264
What?
What do you mean

02:10.298 --> 02:12.433
you can only do eight toppings?

02:12.466 --> 02:14.668
Well that policy's
unacceptable, Lloyd.

02:16.737 --> 02:17.905
Daniel Krumitz?

02:17.938 --> 02:20.374
Uh...

02:20.408 --> 02:22.776
I got to call
you back, Lloyd.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.212
Yeah.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.580
Oh, shoot.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.617
Agent Rosalyn Pierce.

02:29.650 --> 02:30.918
Richmond Field Office.

02:30.951 --> 02:33.621
FBI Violent Crime Squad.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.557
You're... you're Daniel Krumitz?

02:36.590 --> 02:39.227
Yes. Yes. Yes, I am.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.794
(clears throat)

02:40.828 --> 02:43.264
Krummy. No, Krumitz.
Yeah.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.798
Uh, there are
two kids

02:44.832 --> 02:46.367
missing in Richmond, Virginia,

02:46.400 --> 02:48.936
and I need your help.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.771
I hear you have
the best hands in the FBI.

02:59.647 --> 03:01.215
Ready?
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.850
Remind me why
we're doing this again?

03:02.883 --> 03:04.852
Because in social settings,

03:04.885 --> 03:06.787
first impressions
are often formed

03:06.820 --> 03:08.656
in as little
as a tenth of a second.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.891
Okay.
So we're gonna
count to three.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.593
One,

03:12.626 --> 03:13.594
two...

03:13.627 --> 03:15.229
three.

03:15.263 --> 03:17.265
Lose the tie.
Too formal.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.500
You look lovely.

03:20.668 --> 03:21.669
Thanks.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.371
No tie, okay, all right.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.839
You're nervous?
Just a little bit.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.908
I haven't had a
first date since...

03:27.941 --> 03:29.510
Watergate.
(laughs)

03:29.543 --> 03:32.012
Do you have an opening line?

03:32.045 --> 03:34.882
I do. Um... It's very
nice to meet you.

03:34.915 --> 03:38.819
You look even more beautiful
than your-your profile picture.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.889
A little on the nose.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.825
Okay, I can work
on that. Uh, you?

03:44.858 --> 03:46.627
What about your opening line?

03:46.660 --> 03:47.861
(inhales)
Haven't thought about it.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.797
Uh, Director Silver,

03:49.830 --> 03:52.500
this shrimp cocktail's
delicious.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.535
but, shellfish aside,

03:54.568 --> 03:56.504
I'd like to talk about
a little extra funding

03:56.537 --> 03:58.706
for Cyber to catch Python.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.641
Yeah. I-I think

04:00.674 --> 04:02.343
shrimp cocktail's
a little too soon.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.812
You know, I'd wait till
he had a few drinks in him

04:04.845 --> 04:07.481
before you bring up
our most notorious hacker.

04:07.515 --> 04:09.917
(chuckles)
Hmm.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.922
RYAN:
Those two are leaving

04:14.955 --> 04:17.691
in different elevators.
They never used to do that.

04:19.727 --> 04:22.796
They are dating.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.898
Really, two black hats dating--

04:24.932 --> 04:27.335
doesn't that violate the
deal they had with the FBI?

04:27.368 --> 04:29.637
Well, technically.

04:29.670 --> 04:30.971
But look at it from their side.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.706
Everyone they know
is a black hat.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.342
I've cut them off
from all their friends.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.876
They only have each other.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.945
So what are you gonna do,
let 'em off the hook?

04:37.978 --> 04:40.013
Everyone deserves to get laid.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.583
As far as breaking rules,

04:42.616 --> 04:45.919
we'll cross that bridge
if we get to it.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.055
I'm not sure
they're gonna make it.

04:48.088 --> 04:51.992
Nelven is a very improbable
match. They're too alike.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.761
Nelven?

04:55.596 --> 04:56.897
Nelven.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.367
Nelson, Raven,
Nelven?

04:59.400 --> 05:00.801
Oh, you're doing the, uh,

05:00.834 --> 05:04.738
the Brangelina,
Bennifer thing.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.340
The Kimye thing.

05:06.374 --> 05:08.776
Now who, uh, who's that?

05:11.945 --> 05:13.914
PIERCE:
It's like surgery.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.783
You really do
have the magic touch.

05:17.618 --> 05:18.852
Shh.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.821
Just listen.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.093
I don't hear anything.

05:26.126 --> 05:28.796
Well, it's probably too subtle

05:28.829 --> 05:31.799
for your untrained ear...

05:31.832 --> 05:33.867
but she's talking to me.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.669
The missing boys
are 12 and ten.

05:35.703 --> 05:36.870
This phone is our
strongest lead.

05:36.904 --> 05:39.907
We found it submerged in a
fountain about three hours ago.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.842
AMBER Alerts and bolos
have been a dead end.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.978
There.
Let's see what we've got.

05:45.012 --> 05:45.979
Looks like I have

05:46.013 --> 05:48.015
some image files.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.850
Whoa, whoa.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.821
What the hell
was that?

05:53.854 --> 05:55.889
Jacob and Luke Sullivan.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.158
12 and ten years old.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.093
Agent Pierce, what time
did the boys go missing?

06:00.127 --> 06:01.529
So, neighbor
saw them come home

06:01.562 --> 06:03.431
at 3:00, mom got home at 4:00

06:03.464 --> 06:04.565
and they were gone.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.066
Any sign of forced entry?

06:06.099 --> 06:08.536
No. Local PD checked
with friends and relatives.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.003
No one's seen
or heard from them.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.905
This is
the image

06:11.939 --> 06:13.707
I pulled off
of Luke Sullivan's phone.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.008
She's called
Red Crone.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.176
She's an Internet

06:16.209 --> 06:18.446
horror meme that's gone viral
in the last six months.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.780
Apparently

06:19.813 --> 06:21.882
kids are obsessed
with her.
So

06:21.915 --> 06:23.984
the crone is an archetype
in folklore--

06:24.017 --> 06:27.054
an old woman with
supernatural powers.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.922
Every culture has one.

06:28.956 --> 06:32.092
Well, this picture is actually
a digital steganography exploit.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.861
Someone hid
malicious code

06:33.894 --> 06:36.063
inside the pixels
of the JPEG.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.868
Luke's phone was infected
with malware

06:40.901 --> 06:42.135
Now the boys are gone.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.904
Where'd the JPEG come from?

06:43.937 --> 06:44.772
I ran an
image search

06:44.805 --> 06:47.508
and it led me to a forum
for Red Crone.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.042
RYAN:
Looks like the content

06:49.076 --> 06:51.078
is user-generated by fans.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.947
Do we know
who created the Red Crone?

06:53.981 --> 06:55.583
Well, there is
no single author.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.486
Someone took the folklore
character and added

06:58.519 --> 07:01.021
one detail, then other fans
added more details,

07:01.054 --> 07:03.023
until she became a
viral sensation.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.758
Her entire mythology's
user-generated.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.527
Krumitz,

07:06.560 --> 07:07.728
scroll down to earlier posts,

07:07.761 --> 07:08.862
around 3:00 P.M.

07:10.864 --> 07:11.899
Wait, stop.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.534
Go back.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.036
That's them.
That's Jacob and Luke.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.541
This is it. We're finally
going to meet Red Crone.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.042
We're the chosen ones.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.077
We're all packed.
We know the way.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.913
I guess this is good-bye.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.548
Red Crone,
if you're listening...

07:27.581 --> 07:29.583
see you soon.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.253
Look how excited they are.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.723
These really think they're going
to meet a real person.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.224
Yeah, but the Red Crone
is fictional.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.226
We need to be worried
about who those boys

07:39.259 --> 07:40.961
are really gonna go meet.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.230
(woman shrieking)

07:47.067 --> 07:51.238
* I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise *

07:54.908 --> 08:01.148
* I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes *

08:01.181 --> 08:04.685
* I can see
for miles and miles *

08:04.718 --> 08:08.722
* I can see for miles
and miles *

08:08.756 --> 08:12.793
* I can see
for miles and miles *

08:12.826 --> 08:16.564
* And miles...

08:16.597 --> 08:17.598
* Oh, yeah.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.713
(panting)

08:38.719 --> 08:41.789
Hey, where are you at with
the malware on Luke's phone?

08:41.822 --> 08:43.924
When Luke saved this creepy
photo to his phone,

08:43.957 --> 08:46.326
an executable downloaded an app
without him even knowing.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.328
RAMIREZ:
What does the app do?

08:48.361 --> 08:51.164
I don't know yet.
Downloading it now.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.066
Huh, looks like Jacob and Luke
were heavy users

08:53.100 --> 08:55.235
of the Red Crone fan site.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.571
Oh, check this out.
Yeah.

08:57.605 --> 09:00.207
There's a huge spike
of activity

09:00.240 --> 09:01.775
in Richmond
over the last month.

09:01.809 --> 09:04.077
Lots of posts of
sightings of Red Crone.

09:05.746 --> 09:06.747
A cemetery...

09:06.780 --> 09:08.782
flour mill,

09:08.816 --> 09:10.684
an abandoned hotel.

09:10.718 --> 09:11.351
(computer beeps)
Oh!

09:11.384 --> 09:12.352
Here we go.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.855
The app is done loading.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.057
Let's see.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.258
Oh, it's an app

09:18.291 --> 09:19.827
called Eye Of Red Crone.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.662
It's just a viewfinder.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.765
Makes everything
black and white,

09:24.798 --> 09:26.934
adds a horror effect.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.136
It's a camera filter.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.871
Like the ones on Instagram.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.840
Yeah, but there's no button
for taking photos.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.275
So the malware forced
Luke's phone to download

09:35.308 --> 09:38.378
an app that's
a camera filter?

09:38.411 --> 09:40.981
Why have a camera filter
if you can't take a photo?

09:43.784 --> 09:44.952
Red Crone,
if you're listening,

09:44.985 --> 09:46.854
see you soon.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.789
It just doesn't
make sense.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.157
I... this doesn't
sound like my boys.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.760
They wouldn't just
run away like this.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.361
And where are they going?

09:54.394 --> 09:56.664
We're not sure,
but we're gonna find out.

09:56.697 --> 09:59.366
Have your boys ever mentioned
Red Crone before?

09:59.399 --> 10:01.835
No. I mean, I don't know.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.805
They're... they're
always talking about

10:04.838 --> 10:06.807
this character and that
from their...

10:06.840 --> 10:10.210
their games and their apps.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.913
We shouldn't have
gotten them those phones.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.915
Mrs. Sullivan, You didn't
do anything wrong.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.416
All right?
I have a ten-year-old myself,

10:16.449 --> 10:18.952
a daughter. And her mom and I
are having the same conversation

10:18.986 --> 10:21.254
right now. Half the kids
in her class have cell phones.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.757
We're going to
find your boys.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.930
Avery, look at that.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.332
Could be a map or directions

10:32.365 --> 10:34.101
or something. Uh, Mrs. Sullivan,
do you have a printer?

10:34.134 --> 10:35.869
Uh, yes, it's over there.
(phone buzzes)

10:35.903 --> 10:37.805
Excuse me, this
is my husband.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.807
KAREN:
Hi. Do you have any news?

10:39.840 --> 10:41.074
(Karen continues
conversing, indistinctly)

10:44.812 --> 10:47.948
KAREN:
Yeah. Can I come out there?

10:49.116 --> 10:50.417
KAREN:
Okay. Yeah, they're here.

10:50.450 --> 10:51.952
(phone ringing,
Karen continues talking)

10:54.955 --> 10:56.389
Hello?

10:56.423 --> 10:58.826
Y-Yes?

10:58.859 --> 11:00.794
Wha... He what?

11:02.763 --> 11:04.732
Yes, I-I... I understand

11:04.765 --> 11:06.466
your slots are limited. Uh...

11:06.499 --> 11:08.836
I will do that. Thank you.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.137
Is everything all right?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.171
My dad.

11:11.204 --> 11:14.007
I lined up the best clinic,
the best doctors,

11:14.041 --> 11:15.275
and he doesn't show up

11:15.308 --> 11:16.944
for his first
radiation treatment.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.045
Elijah, I'm so sorry.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.913
It's...

11:19.947 --> 11:22.082
This was the last thing
on the printer cache.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.484
It doesn't look like a map,
it looks like an invitation.
Yeah.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.819
"You've been chosen.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.188
Enter the wilderness
if you dare."

11:28.221 --> 11:29.923
Well, if the boys were headed
into the "wilderness,"

11:29.957 --> 11:31.391
why did they find
Luke's phone

11:31.424 --> 11:34.161
at a fountain in Richmond?
(sighs)

11:34.194 --> 11:37.297
Well, this is the last known
location of Jacob and Luke.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.867
According to cell tower data,
both their phones

11:39.900 --> 11:43.003
dropped off the network
right here around 6:00 p.m.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.005
So Luke's phone
was recovered...

11:45.038 --> 11:46.373
from the fountain.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.176
Right? What...
what about Jacob's?

11:49.209 --> 11:51.078
Oh, Agent Pierce
and her team searched

11:51.111 --> 11:54.347
the entire area--
they never found it.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.184
RUSSELL:
Pull up a photo

11:57.217 --> 11:59.386
of Luke's phone.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.826
Are you gonna...

12:05.859 --> 12:08.495
Yeah. Yep,
yep, yep.
O... kay.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.298
Okay, let me, uh...

12:11.331 --> 12:12.732
All right.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.203
Don't get that wet,
don't get that wet.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.371
You're such a worrywart,
you know that?

12:18.405 --> 12:19.306
I won't.

12:21.508 --> 12:25.212
Looks like Luke's phone
collided with the cement...

12:25.245 --> 12:27.514
right there.

12:27.547 --> 12:30.050
You know, it's too hard to tell
from these crime scene photos

12:30.083 --> 12:31.484
if there was
a struggle.

12:31.518 --> 12:34.354
Well, according
to Luke's call history,

12:34.387 --> 12:37.024
he tried to call his mom seconds
before his phone went dead.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.358
But the call never went through.

12:38.391 --> 12:39.960
Okay, so what...

12:39.993 --> 12:42.863
what do we know?
Luke and Jacob left their house,

12:42.896 --> 12:44.531
travelled three miles

12:44.564 --> 12:47.935
to get to this spot,
and then...

12:47.968 --> 12:49.903
something happened.

12:49.937 --> 12:53.440
Somebody wanted
to take those boys offline.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.075
And it worked.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.010
*

12:57.044 --> 12:58.979
When is a viewfinder
not a viewfinder?

12:59.012 --> 13:00.814
RAVEN:
Just got a text from Elijah.

13:03.984 --> 13:06.286
Elijah wants us to figure out
who sent the invitation

13:06.319 --> 13:07.420
to the boys.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.389
The printer cache
said it was printed

13:09.422 --> 13:11.524
directly off
the Red Crone fan site.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.093
(tapping keyboard)

13:13.126 --> 13:15.095
Oh, it just keeps auto-focusing
like crazy.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.530
RAVEN:
That's what cameras do.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.366
Yeah, but it's not a camera,
remember?

13:19.399 --> 13:22.469
(electronic chime)
It's like it's searching
for something.

13:29.442 --> 13:32.012
Oh, here we go--
I think I found it.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.914
A link of the invitation

13:33.947 --> 13:36.283
was sent directly to Jacob
in the comments section

13:36.316 --> 13:37.918
by someone with
the handle:

13:37.951 --> 13:39.552
Crone805.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.189
"To fulfill your destiny,

13:42.222 --> 13:44.524
you must view the world
through my eyes."

13:44.557 --> 13:45.625
Okay, hold on.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.494
"View the world
through my eyes."

13:47.527 --> 13:50.497
And the app's called
Eye of Red Crone?

13:50.530 --> 13:51.965
Mm-hmm.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.534
Eye of Red Crone.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.170
That's it! Nelson...
Okay, I think we're supposed

13:57.204 --> 13:59.406
to hold up the viewfinder
to the invitation.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.640
All right.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.276
(wings flapping, echoing scream)

14:03.310 --> 14:05.645
NELSON (chuckles):
Snap! Look...

14:05.678 --> 14:08.081
It's not a viewfinder.

14:08.115 --> 14:10.350
It's a decoder.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.919
What do you got, Krummy?

14:11.952 --> 14:14.888
Nelson said our target
preprogrammed this decoder app

14:14.922 --> 14:17.190
with certain
trigger images.

14:17.224 --> 14:20.193
Now, the decoder constantly
searches for these images
until it finds one,

14:20.227 --> 14:22.362
and when it does, it
decodes a secret message.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.464
Does the trigger image
have to be on a piece of paper,

14:24.497 --> 14:26.299
like the invitation?
No, no. It can
be anything.

14:26.333 --> 14:29.436
It can be a drawing, a symbol,
an object-- pretty much...

14:29.469 --> 14:30.470
any two-dimensional

14:30.503 --> 14:32.439
or three-dimensional object
in the real world.

14:32.472 --> 14:33.907
RUSSELL:
So when Jacob

14:33.941 --> 14:36.143
and Luke launched this app
at their house

14:36.176 --> 14:38.178
and then focused
on the invitation here,

14:38.211 --> 14:39.412
Mm-hmm.
they came up with...

14:39.446 --> 14:41.414
the riddle.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.583
RUSSELL/KRUMITZ/RYAN:
Whoa.

14:43.616 --> 14:47.220
"If you're truly a chosen one,
go to where the serpents feed.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.556
"Stand with your feet
at the water's edge,

14:49.589 --> 14:51.224
and they will
show you the way."

14:51.258 --> 14:53.326
So... serpent.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.562
Right?

14:55.595 --> 14:58.165
This is Serpent Ridge Fountain.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.467
This is a famous landmark.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.103
This is why the boys came here.
If the app

15:03.136 --> 15:05.238
is telling Jacob and Luke
where to go...
RUSSELL: Right.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.540
the next trigger image
should be... right here.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.178
RYAN: Here,
Krumitz, try this.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.283
KRUMITZ:
Elijah, nothing's happening.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.052
No.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.553
The trigger image isn't here.

15:20.587 --> 15:21.955
Pull up the fan site.

15:21.989 --> 15:25.358
Search the Red Crone
mythology for key words.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.227
Chosen one.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.062
Water's edge.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.663
Serpent.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.634
Okay, the chosen ones are the
children who Red Crone invites

15:34.667 --> 15:36.603
to join her
in her mansion in the woods.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.171
Water's edge refers
to the lake

15:38.205 --> 15:40.240
Red Crone and her
children would go to

15:40.273 --> 15:42.542
to watch the sunset.
All right, wait a minute.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.211
Sunset.

15:44.244 --> 15:47.347
You know, maybe it has to be
sunset for the decoder to work.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.984
Change the internal
clock on the tablet

15:51.018 --> 15:52.719
so that it thinks
it's sunset.

15:54.654 --> 15:58.091
It's now 6:03 p.m.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.626
Guys, it's working!

15:59.659 --> 16:02.562
"Touch my hand
if you have the courage

16:02.595 --> 16:05.665
to be invisible.
No cheating."

16:07.634 --> 16:09.769
(beep)
It puts the tablet
in airplane mode.

16:09.802 --> 16:14.007
Clever. Makes
the kids untraceable.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.575
Invisible to anybody
who wants to find them.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.177
That's also why Jacob's phone

16:17.210 --> 16:18.645
went off the network
with Luke's.

16:18.678 --> 16:19.446
What about Luke's phone?

16:19.479 --> 16:21.514
Why did it end up
in the fountain?

16:21.548 --> 16:22.449
Well, Luke
tried to call

16:22.482 --> 16:23.516
his mother
moments before the phone died.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.219
He wouldn't be able to do that
in airplane mode.

16:26.253 --> 16:28.388
A phone not in airplane
mode is cheating.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.057
So Luke was breaking the rules.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.658
Maybe the boys argued about it.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.327
What are you doing?
Calling Mom.
I want to go home.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.163
No. That's cheating!

16:37.730 --> 16:39.432
Okay, there's...
there's another page.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.700
Check this out.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.036
"Follow the blackbird
to where the bodies lie.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.337
"If you listen closely,

16:44.371 --> 16:46.639
a young blood cries."

16:46.673 --> 16:48.541
"Bodies lie."
"Young blood cries."

16:48.575 --> 16:49.576
MUNDO:
Wait a minute.

16:49.609 --> 16:50.677
Wait a minute.
Look at that.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.512
It always points
the same direction.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.581
It's a compass.
The blackbird tells the boys

16:54.614 --> 16:55.515
what direction to go, and...

16:55.548 --> 16:58.318
I guess the riddle
tells them where to stop.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.220
This is a virtual treasure hunt.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.189
But the prize at the end
isn't treasure.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.223
It's a trap.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.533
RYAN:
Elijah!

17:19.439 --> 17:22.342
KRUMITZ:
"Follow the blackbird
to where the bodies lie.

17:22.375 --> 17:26.313
If you listen closely,
a young blood cries."

17:26.346 --> 17:28.748
This is it--
where... where the bodies lie.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.684
RUSSELL:
First a fountain,
now a cemetery.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.221
These kids are being lured
with this treasure hunt.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.456
Willingly lured.
They're "legend tripping."

17:36.489 --> 17:37.790
(birds cawing)

17:37.824 --> 17:40.127
They think
they're on a ghost hunt

17:40.160 --> 17:42.762
to prove
an urban legend is real.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.564
What do we know
about Crone805?

17:44.597 --> 17:46.566
Raven said he's
behind all the posts

17:46.599 --> 17:49.402
about Red Crone sightings
in Richmond.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.471
He anonymized his handle
using a VPN.

17:51.504 --> 17:54.741
A virtual private network
that's untraceable, right?

17:54.774 --> 17:57.677
So at least we know our
target is text-savvy.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.446
Savvy-ish.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.214
He didn't write the exploit
that put malware

18:01.248 --> 18:03.416
on Luke's phone-- Russian
hackers have been selling it

18:03.450 --> 18:05.418
on the Deep Web
for a hundred bucks.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.187
Well, that means
he's a script kiddie,

18:07.220 --> 18:09.122
not a true black hat.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.858
Krumitz, let's search
this side, see if we can
find that trigger image.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.694
Look at this.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.164
I was looking at the art
that our target posted

18:17.197 --> 18:18.865
on this... this fan site.

18:18.898 --> 18:21.434
I mean, it's disturbing,
yes, but it's...

18:21.468 --> 18:24.137
clearly done
with a sophisticated hand.

18:24.171 --> 18:26.839
I think maybe we're looking
for an artist.

18:26.873 --> 18:29.142
An artist and a predator.

18:29.176 --> 18:31.678
Likely male.
He's trolling the sites,

18:31.711 --> 18:33.146
searching
for local kids

18:33.180 --> 18:35.282
who are obsessed with Red Crone.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.450
Selected Jacob and Luke...

18:37.484 --> 18:38.851
and tricked them

18:38.885 --> 18:41.254
into becoming his...
unknowing victims.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.255
A problem, this...

18:42.289 --> 18:45.692
this fan site is
a virtual attractive nuisance.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.161
It has hidden hazards

18:48.195 --> 18:50.630
that... that are
attracting these kids.

18:50.663 --> 18:53.233
Anyplace with
unsupervised kids is a...

18:53.266 --> 18:55.302
magnet for pedophiles.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.908
*

19:10.917 --> 19:13.920
(phone vibrating)

19:17.790 --> 19:20.327
(phone continues vibrating)

19:25.665 --> 19:26.933
Hello?

19:28.635 --> 19:30.237
I-I can't.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.171
I-It's my day off.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.908
No, I have plans today.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.978
Okay.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.713
Okay, fine.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.583
(sighs):
Yeah, I'll-I'll be there.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.357
(sighs heavily)

19:52.992 --> 19:55.862
(birds cawing)

19:55.895 --> 19:58.465
MUNDO:
Krumitz!

19:58.498 --> 20:00.233
The riddle said something
about "young blood."

20:00.267 --> 20:02.235
Look at the numbers
on that grave.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.636
It's the grave of a child.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.674
Ooh.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.309
Avery?
We found it.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.280
"Along with your blood,
it's your soul I crave.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.315
"Leave a token of your loyalty

20:15.348 --> 20:16.449
to prove you're brave."

20:16.483 --> 20:19.018
Token of loyalty.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.954
Guys, we got blood.
RUSSELL: Where?

20:21.988 --> 20:23.222
RYAN:
Ooh, looks fresh.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.259
Ooh.
Okay.

20:26.293 --> 20:29.896
This is a... hyperspectral lens.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.831
Can measure the oxygen level

20:31.864 --> 20:33.366
in blood.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.867
Can tell you

20:34.901 --> 20:36.536
within a five-minute window

20:36.569 --> 20:40.473
how long blood...
has been outside of the body.

20:40.507 --> 20:41.474
(shutter clicks)

20:41.508 --> 20:42.642
(burbling)

20:46.946 --> 20:48.881
(rapid beeping)

20:48.915 --> 20:51.418
His blood's
less than an hour old.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.287
All right, that means Jacob and
Luke can't be that far ahead.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.656
RYAN:
Elijah, look, a blood trail.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.762
(shutter clicks)

21:07.400 --> 21:09.769
There's some blood. Here.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.738
(whimpering)
It's okay. It's okay.

21:11.771 --> 21:12.939
I'm not gonna hurt you.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.341
My name's Avery.
What's your name?

21:14.374 --> 21:17.477
(crying and gasping)

21:17.510 --> 21:19.579
Timmy. Elijah,
call the paramedics.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.047
Timmy?

21:21.080 --> 21:24.083
Timmy, okay, I'm gonna put
some pressure on this, okay?

21:24.116 --> 21:25.785
I'm gonna hold your hand up,

21:25.818 --> 21:27.987
I'm gonna get you
to a doctor, Timmy.
No.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.422
No, I have to keep going!

21:29.456 --> 21:31.324
I need to make it to the end!

21:31.358 --> 21:32.792
Yeah, settle down, settle down.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.494
I'm gonna stay
right here with you.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.062
It's okay. Where are you going?

21:36.095 --> 21:39.399
To go meet Red Crone?

21:39.432 --> 21:41.934
Timmy, what makes you think
Red Crone is real?

21:41.968 --> 21:45.071
People talk about her online.

21:45.104 --> 21:47.340
They've seen her.

21:47.374 --> 21:49.342
And she sent me a present.

21:49.376 --> 21:51.010
A present?

21:51.043 --> 21:54.013
An app... on my phone.

21:54.046 --> 21:56.583
It popped up like magic.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.117
She chose me.

21:58.150 --> 22:01.621
Have you seen any other kids
on this treasure hunt?

22:01.654 --> 22:03.356
No.

22:03.390 --> 22:05.958
Has anyone else spoken
to you about Red Crone?

22:05.992 --> 22:09.028
No. I have
to keep going.

22:09.061 --> 22:11.398
No, no, no.
I'm the Chosen One.

22:11.431 --> 22:13.366
I'm the...
Honey, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.469
Honey, honey, okay.
Shh, shh. Let's get...
(crying)

22:16.503 --> 22:18.505
(garbled radio transmission)

22:24.977 --> 22:27.079
I'm worried, D.B.

22:27.113 --> 22:30.783
Timmy was invested to that
legend to the point of delusion.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.485
They're not just fans,
they're fanatics.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.421
We need to shut
this site down.

22:34.454 --> 22:37.757
The riddle is asking them to
leave a token of their loyalty.

22:37.790 --> 22:40.860
If they have to prove
their devotion at each step,

22:40.893 --> 22:43.796
they'll grow more and more
indoctrinated along the way.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.432
He's brainwashing them.

22:45.465 --> 22:47.834
And if they're required
to physically hurt themselves

22:47.867 --> 22:49.869
this early on,
imagine what they'll be required

22:49.902 --> 22:53.640
to do when they reach the end.

22:53.673 --> 22:57.143
I found additional
blood at the gravestone.

22:57.176 --> 22:58.645
It was dried.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.513
If it belongs to
either Jacob or Luke,

23:00.547 --> 23:02.148
then they're further
ahead than we thought.

23:02.181 --> 23:04.183
How much further?
Eight hours.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.453
Eight hours?! Who knows

23:06.486 --> 23:08.588
how many steps there are
to this treasure hunt?

23:08.621 --> 23:10.990
We don't have time
to play this sick game.

23:11.023 --> 23:13.526
We have to skip to the end now.

23:15.194 --> 23:18.130
This app is sophisticated.

23:18.164 --> 23:20.199
And it puts phones
in airplane mode,

23:20.232 --> 23:22.034
killing GPS and cell reception.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.837
Yeah, but the game and
internal compass keeps running.

23:24.871 --> 23:29.175
No clues as to Jacob and Luke's
location on FriendAgenda.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.845
Raven, who's Henry?

23:36.148 --> 23:37.850
I... I'm sorry.
Did you go through my phone?

23:37.884 --> 23:40.086
No.
Did you hack it?

23:40.119 --> 23:42.589
No, I just seen a text
pop up on your screen.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.924
Oh, okay, so you did
go through my phone.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.693
No, it was unlocked.
It right in front of me.

23:46.726 --> 23:47.960
Thought it was
Elijah texting again.

23:47.994 --> 23:50.630
Okay, well, that text
is private, Nelson.

23:50.663 --> 23:51.798
It's none of your business.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.733
Oh, yeah?
'Cause the last time I checked,

23:53.766 --> 23:55.668
we was all up
in each other's business.

23:58.705 --> 24:00.973
(door creaks open)

24:05.745 --> 24:07.480
(man coughing)

24:21.828 --> 24:23.896
When I was analyzing
the code for the app,

24:23.930 --> 24:25.932
I found a bunch of
leftover dead code.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.134
I mean, our target
built his treasure hunt

24:28.167 --> 24:30.737
off the framework
of another app.

24:30.770 --> 24:31.904
So Avery was right.

24:31.938 --> 24:33.139
He is just a script kiddie.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.575
He found an app that had all
the functionalities he wanted--

24:35.608 --> 24:37.209
a game called Panda Pavilion.

24:37.243 --> 24:38.878
Then wrote code on top of it.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.246
Look at what happens
when I activate

24:40.279 --> 24:43.883
the paths to the dead code.

24:43.916 --> 24:46.586
Did you contact the developers
of Panda Pavilion?

24:46.619 --> 24:47.820
Yup, but get this.

24:47.854 --> 24:49.722
They only sold 34 downloads

24:49.756 --> 24:52.224
because there was a competing
app that was way more popular.

24:52.258 --> 24:54.193
So basically,
our target knocked off

24:54.226 --> 24:56.929
a cheap and unpopular knock-off.

24:56.963 --> 24:58.097
Which is good for us.

24:58.130 --> 25:00.232
Our target has
to be one of the 34 people

25:00.266 --> 25:01.601
who downloaded that app.

25:01.634 --> 25:02.835
He had to pay for it somehow.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.671
Well, maybe
that's where he made a mistake.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.205
He could have used
his personal credit cards.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.875
That should get us
his name and address.

25:08.908 --> 25:10.076
Yeah, you're right.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.711
I'm on it.

25:21.087 --> 25:23.289
KRUMITZ: I imaged
Oliver Crispin's computer.

25:23.322 --> 25:25.157
Found a ton of media files, but

25:25.191 --> 25:27.059
no child pornography.

25:27.093 --> 25:29.195
Look where he
keeps his supplies.

25:29.228 --> 25:32.565
He's left-handed--
a common trait among pedophiles.

25:34.701 --> 25:38.070
These children--
their images, their eyes--

25:38.104 --> 25:40.106
they're almost too innocent.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.741
MUNDO:
They're all wearing nightgowns.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.209
It's creepy.

25:43.242 --> 25:45.144
That's part of the mythology.

25:45.177 --> 25:46.813
The fire
in the orphanage happened

25:46.846 --> 25:49.115
in the middle of the night.

25:49.148 --> 25:51.117
Look at this perspective.

25:51.150 --> 25:54.220
Oliver is viewing the world
through the child's eyes.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.722
It's a subconscious

25:55.755 --> 25:57.724
attempt to identify
with their innocence.

25:57.757 --> 26:00.159
He's a non-contact pedophile.

26:00.192 --> 26:02.261
Non-contact?
It's likely he's never

26:02.294 --> 26:03.863
physically acted on his urges.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.599
He's been able
to suppress them for a long time

26:06.633 --> 26:08.134
using his art and his
fantasies as an outlet.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.302
Then what's the point
of the treasure hunt?

26:10.336 --> 26:12.004
Clearly, he's luring Luke
and Jacob to do something.

26:12.038 --> 26:13.840
No, he's planning to act.

26:13.873 --> 26:16.075
To lose his virginity,
so to speak.

26:16.108 --> 26:19.779
He has fixated on this
moment for a long time.

26:19.812 --> 26:21.914
The treasure hunt
is his foreplay.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.650
It's sick.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.818
Guys like this should be
put down like dogs.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.754
Hey, guys?

26:27.787 --> 26:30.990
Oliver's a court illustrator,
and I just found this e-mail.

26:31.023 --> 26:34.994
"Preliminary hearing has been
moved to Courtroom B." 3:00 p.m.

26:35.027 --> 26:38.130
3:35. He's in court
right now.
Go.

26:48.908 --> 26:52.378
Okay, everyone,
let's call it a day.

26:52.411 --> 26:53.713
Court's adjourned

26:53.746 --> 26:55.882
until 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

27:02.221 --> 27:03.355
FBI.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.658
WOMAN:
Oh.
FBI.

27:05.692 --> 27:06.926
Oh.
Oh, sorry.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.795
Hey!

27:10.162 --> 27:11.864
Elevator.
Easy, man.

27:11.898 --> 27:12.932
FBI.

27:12.965 --> 27:13.966
(door creaks open)

27:25.111 --> 27:26.245
Raven, our target's on the move.

27:26.278 --> 27:27.413
Put out a BOLO,
and an APB on his car.

27:27.446 --> 27:28.748
Are we tracking his cell phone?

27:28.781 --> 27:30.382
His cell plan was
recently canceled.

27:30.416 --> 27:32.118
If he has a phone,
it's a burner.

27:32.151 --> 27:34.120
Look, Elijah,

27:34.153 --> 27:36.455
Krumitz sent me what he imaged
from Oliver's home computer.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.291
I found photos of five trigger
images for his treasure hunt.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.293
I analyzed
the metadata and pulled

27:41.327 --> 27:42.695
GPS coordinates for all of them.

27:42.729 --> 27:44.096
RAVEN:
Okay, we mapped them out.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.065
The boys are headed
to Stony Creek State Park.

27:46.098 --> 27:47.299
MUNDO: Guys, that's

27:47.333 --> 27:48.567
a pretty big park.
NELSON:
Yeah, I know but

27:48.600 --> 27:51.938
we're stuck. The decoder doesn't
work on the last trigger image.

27:51.971 --> 27:54.406
It should be giving us a
blackbird and riddle that leads

27:54.440 --> 27:56.108
to the final location where

27:56.142 --> 27:57.176
the target's meeting the kids,
but it's not working.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.779
What's the image?
It's an eye carved in a tree.

27:59.812 --> 28:03.282
We have the GPS coordinates, but
that's as far as we can get you.

28:03.315 --> 28:05.051
All right, send the coordinates.
We'll just have to go there

28:05.084 --> 28:06.252
and figure things out
on the ground.

28:06.285 --> 28:09.889
(siren blaring)

28:09.922 --> 28:12.158
All right, this is the spot.

28:12.191 --> 28:15.361
We're looking for this image
carved into a tree.

28:15.394 --> 28:18.798
Take those, pass them around.

28:18.831 --> 28:21.734
(overlapping chatter)

28:27.439 --> 28:29.776
What?

28:29.809 --> 28:33.045
The cracks in the bark,
and look at the carving.

28:33.079 --> 28:35.181
See that white right there?
That's fungus.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.784
This tree has oak wilt.

28:37.817 --> 28:40.219
It's rotting
from the inside out.

28:40.252 --> 28:41.821
All right,
we're looking for a...

28:41.854 --> 28:43.455
a tree with a lot of

28:43.489 --> 28:46.292
dead leaves on it.

28:49.195 --> 28:50.262
Got anything?

28:50.296 --> 28:53.399
Right there, that's it.

28:53.432 --> 28:54.767
It's got dead leaves.

28:54.801 --> 28:56.769
(indistinct radio
communication)

28:56.803 --> 28:58.805
MAN:
Yeah, over there.

29:04.476 --> 29:06.545
MAN:
Down this gulley?

29:06.578 --> 29:08.981
MAN 2: Well, go ahead
check it out.

29:09.015 --> 29:11.483
MAN 3:
Check your perimeter.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.119
Hey, guys?

29:13.152 --> 29:14.320
MAN: Come on, guys!
Over here!

29:14.353 --> 29:16.555
It's one of their hats.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.157
The boys have been here.

29:18.190 --> 29:21.160
(sighs)
Okay.

29:21.193 --> 29:23.495
MAN: Tell them
to come back!

29:23.529 --> 29:27.199
Krumitz, here! Here! Here.

29:27.233 --> 29:29.468
(panting)

29:29.501 --> 29:31.203
MAN:
Keep your eyes open!
It's in this area!

29:31.237 --> 29:32.238
RYAN:
You got it!

29:32.271 --> 29:34.473
"Welcome to the wilderness.
You're almost there.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.976
"I can sense your
soul around me.

29:37.009 --> 29:39.078
Come to my playground
if you dare."

29:39.111 --> 29:41.380
Nelson?

29:41.413 --> 29:42.514
All right, Avery, I'm here.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.216
I see your location
on the satellite.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.853
The new compass heading
is one-nine-five.

29:46.886 --> 29:49.488
Do you see any
structures on that path?

29:49.521 --> 29:51.257
Uh...

29:51.290 --> 29:53.559
Looks like
an abandoned schoolhouse.

29:53.592 --> 29:54.726
I'm sending the coordinates now.

29:54.760 --> 29:57.529
Let's get this son of a bitch.
New coordinates. SWAT on me.

29:57.563 --> 30:01.067
MAN:
Copy that.
MAN 2:
Bring 'em in.

30:01.100 --> 30:04.036
(sighs)

30:04.070 --> 30:06.338
(breathing loudly)

30:06.372 --> 30:08.174
(exhales loudly)

30:11.443 --> 30:14.146
All right, go!

30:14.180 --> 30:17.283
Go!
MAN (over radio):
We're a half mile out on that.

30:18.617 --> 30:20.586
(breathing loudly)

30:20.619 --> 30:23.122
WOMAN (over radio):
...location, guys. Location.

30:23.155 --> 30:28.227
(crying)

30:28.260 --> 30:30.262
(indistinct chatter)

30:31.430 --> 30:33.232
(indistinct chatter)
(gasps)

30:34.300 --> 30:35.467
Go! go!

30:35.501 --> 30:37.169
(indistinct shouting)

30:38.637 --> 30:40.472
MAN:
Clear!

30:40.506 --> 30:42.909

Clear!
Clear!

30:44.343 --> 30:46.278
(knocking)

30:46.312 --> 30:48.314
(door creaks open)

30:50.249 --> 30:51.918
Jacob, Luke.

30:51.951 --> 30:52.952
Hi.

30:52.985 --> 30:54.620
Hi.

30:57.456 --> 31:00.059
Red Crone is waiting for you.

31:02.328 --> 31:04.296
What the hell happened?
They should be here.

31:04.330 --> 31:06.532
Nelson, are there
any other structures

31:06.565 --> 31:08.667
along the current heading?

31:08.700 --> 31:11.470
No, the schoolhouse is the
only one for the next 18 miles.

31:11.503 --> 31:13.239
Expand the search area
in all directions.

31:13.272 --> 31:15.274
Look for any structures

31:15.307 --> 31:17.309
within a five-mile radius
of the trigger image.

31:17.343 --> 31:18.510
Cross-reference
property records.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.246
Look for something, anything,

31:20.279 --> 31:21.580
that can be
our target's hideout.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.349
D.B., Krumitz,

31:23.382 --> 31:24.350
we missed something.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.418
Go back to the trigger image,
decode it again.

31:26.452 --> 31:27.586
Anything?

31:27.619 --> 31:30.022
I'm getting the same thing,
Avery.

31:30.056 --> 31:31.323
Something is not right.

31:31.357 --> 31:32.558
We missed something.

31:32.591 --> 31:35.261
Maybe it's the riddle, or maybe
we're looking at this wrong.

31:35.294 --> 31:37.263
Maybe we just need
to slow down here, you know,

31:37.296 --> 31:41.033
and-and think like a kid, okay?

31:41.067 --> 31:42.501
We need to think
like a kid.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.403
MAN:
Keep your eyes open.

31:45.237 --> 31:48.240
Wait a minute.
I have an idea.

31:52.078 --> 31:54.313
Look at that.

31:54.346 --> 31:55.614
KRUMITZ:
Holy crap.

31:55.647 --> 31:57.149
It just changed.

31:57.183 --> 31:58.985
RUSSELL:
"Welcome to the wilderness,

31:59.018 --> 32:02.388
"be afraid of the night.
I can sense your soul around me.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.123
Search the woods
for red light."

32:04.156 --> 32:05.357
Avery...

32:05.391 --> 32:07.659
there are two riddles,
one for adults

32:07.693 --> 32:09.228
and one for kids,

32:09.261 --> 32:11.130
depending on the-the tilt
of the tablet.

32:11.163 --> 32:14.066
The decoder's using the tablet's
gyroscope to distinguish

32:14.100 --> 32:16.002
between an adult
perspective and a kid's.

32:16.035 --> 32:17.403
NELSON:
That's why I couldn't get it
to work.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.405
I had the decoder
at the wrong angle.

32:19.438 --> 32:22.074
Oliver did this on his last
trigger image as a safeguard.

32:22.108 --> 32:24.043
To throw adults off his trail.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.211
MUNDO:
To throw law enforcement
off the trail.

32:25.244 --> 32:26.678
AVERY:
What is the new

32:26.712 --> 32:28.047
compass heading?

32:28.080 --> 32:29.148
Two-seven-zero.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.350
75 degrees off the old heading.

32:31.383 --> 32:33.252
It's an old theater.

32:33.285 --> 32:34.353
Used to be part of a resort

32:34.386 --> 32:36.355
that closed down in the '70s.

32:36.388 --> 32:37.323
Send me the coordinates.

32:37.356 --> 32:41.093
(trilling)

32:43.362 --> 32:45.464
It's about a half hour away.

32:48.234 --> 32:50.069
Elijah!

32:50.102 --> 32:52.404
Elijah! Wait for backup!
(engine starts)

32:52.438 --> 32:54.006
Come on, move out!

32:54.040 --> 32:56.042
(creaking)

33:19.798 --> 33:20.999
(door creaking)

33:30.642 --> 33:32.211
Elijah!

33:32.244 --> 33:35.281
Wait for backup!
(panting)

34:02.508 --> 34:06.478
Oliver Crispin, FBI.
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

34:06.512 --> 34:07.679
(grunting)

34:09.881 --> 34:11.617
Where are the kids?

34:14.120 --> 34:16.588
(grunting, panting)

34:20.892 --> 34:25.097
Jacob, Luke,
you okay?

34:25.131 --> 34:25.864
Did he hurt you?

34:25.897 --> 34:27.799
No.

34:27.833 --> 34:28.734
My name's Elijah.
I'm here to help.

34:28.767 --> 34:30.636
Stay right where you are.
Be right back.

34:30.669 --> 34:33.172
CRISPIN:
It was just a game.

34:33.205 --> 34:35.507
I just wanted to scare them.
I wasn't gonna hurt them.

34:35.541 --> 34:38.444
They wanted to play.
They wanted it!

34:38.477 --> 34:39.445
(grunts)

34:39.478 --> 34:40.879
They wanted it!

34:40.912 --> 34:43.115
(grunting, panting)

34:47.686 --> 34:49.221
(panting)

34:49.255 --> 34:50.389
What did you say?

34:50.422 --> 34:51.490
They wanted it.

34:51.523 --> 34:54.126
(grunts)

34:54.160 --> 34:59.465
In the bathroom.

34:59.498 --> 35:00.499
(grunts)

35:03.169 --> 35:04.203
You son of a bitch.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.307
Elijah! Where are the boys?

35:08.340 --> 35:10.176
There.

35:10.209 --> 35:14.146
Okay. It's-it's okay, it's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

35:14.180 --> 35:16.148
You're safe. It's okay.

35:16.182 --> 35:18.317
I'm Agent Avery Ryan.
I'm here to take you home.

35:18.350 --> 35:19.251
(boys crying)

35:25.924 --> 35:28.126
(distant siren whooping)

35:29.828 --> 35:31.830
(indistinct radio
communication)

35:35.834 --> 35:38.937
MAN (over radio):
Hey, uh, I'm gonna be here
another 15.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.173
Do me a favor.

35:41.207 --> 35:43.509
Then I'm gonna show you
something really cool.

35:43.542 --> 35:44.843
Cut it in half.

35:44.876 --> 35:46.378
There you go. Nice.

35:46.412 --> 35:48.380
All right,
I'm gonna put this here and...

35:48.414 --> 35:51.383
I asked you
to cut this in half.

35:51.417 --> 35:52.884
What's wrong with you?

35:52.918 --> 35:55.221
You're supposed to cut it in
half-- is there something wrong
WOMAN: Jacob!

35:55.254 --> 35:56.722
with your scissors? What...
Luke!

35:57.656 --> 35:59.658
Mom!
Mom!

35:59.691 --> 36:00.526
Dad!
Dad!

36:00.559 --> 36:02.894
(crying)

36:06.965 --> 36:09.167
JACOB: I'm so glad
you're here.

36:10.969 --> 36:13.171
(indistinct radio communication)

36:15.974 --> 36:17.943
Agent Pierce?

36:17.976 --> 36:20.346
It's Daniel Krumitz.

36:20.379 --> 36:21.947
(chuckles)
I got good news.

36:21.980 --> 36:25.351
The boys are safe.
We caught the guy.

36:25.384 --> 36:27.486
Yeah. Yeah.

36:27.519 --> 36:30.956
No, no, no. You don't have to...

36:30.989 --> 36:32.958
Dinner?

36:32.991 --> 36:35.627
Me?

36:35.661 --> 36:38.897
This is Daniel Krumitz.
You know that, right?

36:38.930 --> 36:40.932
(chuckles)

36:42.000 --> 36:45.271
I do have the magic touch.
(chuckles)

36:46.272 --> 36:48.807
Pizza sounds great.

36:54.580 --> 36:57.549
Krumitz.

36:57.583 --> 37:00.786
You crossed a line
tonight.

37:00.819 --> 37:04.022
You didn't wait
for backup. You put

37:04.055 --> 37:05.023
yourself in danger.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.225
(scoffing)

37:08.760 --> 37:11.263
You're going through something,
Elijah. I get that.

37:11.297 --> 37:14.533
But working out your aggression
on the job is not an option.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.535
That's not what
happened here tonight.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.370
I made sure that
those kids were safe.

37:18.404 --> 37:20.639
And our target, he
got what he deserved.

37:20.672 --> 37:23.309
You've been throwing
a lot of punches lately.

37:23.342 --> 37:24.710
I always follow protocol.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.244
In this case, you didn't.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.880
I'm taking you out of the field.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.649
You what?

37:30.682 --> 37:33.051
Avery, come on.
Just until you get your head
straight.

37:33.084 --> 37:36.288
Elijah,

37:36.322 --> 37:39.925
this is not you.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.670
(crickets chirping)

37:56.608 --> 37:58.043
If you came here to lecture me

37:58.076 --> 37:59.778
about not making
that appointment,

37:59.811 --> 38:01.313
you can save your breath.

38:01.347 --> 38:02.981
Chicken soup.

38:03.014 --> 38:05.050
From Michelle.

38:14.059 --> 38:16.895
You look like hell.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.930
So do you.

38:21.367 --> 38:24.002
Least I got an excuse.

38:24.035 --> 38:26.071
Avery took me out

38:26.104 --> 38:27.573
of the field today.

38:27.606 --> 38:29.508
(exhales)

38:29.541 --> 38:32.744
I guess stubbornness runs
in the family.

38:32.778 --> 38:35.847
(chuckles)

38:35.881 --> 38:39.385
Fourth grade. Joey Baumgarten.

38:39.418 --> 38:40.586
Remember?

38:40.619 --> 38:42.087
Yeah.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.623
Pushed me off my bike,
punched me in the face,

38:44.656 --> 38:46.525
let the air out of my tires.

38:46.558 --> 38:49.528
You pushed your bike
all the way home crying.

38:51.062 --> 38:54.065
Do you remember
what you said to me?

38:55.100 --> 38:58.103
Oh...

38:58.136 --> 39:01.973
You said, "Son, you take
as much time as you need.

39:02.007 --> 39:04.109
"But when you're ready,
you're gonna fight Joey,

39:04.142 --> 39:06.445
and you're gonna win."

39:09.648 --> 39:12.618
Two days later,

39:12.651 --> 39:16.888
you drove me to the park.
I found Joey.

39:16.922 --> 39:18.390
And I won.

39:22.561 --> 39:23.962
Dad, you got cancer.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.434
Now,

39:28.467 --> 39:32.170
you and I both...

39:32.203 --> 39:35.407
need to come to terms with that
in our own way.

39:39.545 --> 39:41.547
So take as much
time as you need.

39:44.149 --> 39:46.652
But when you're ready...

39:46.685 --> 39:49.187
we're gonna fight.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.923
And we're gonna win.

39:55.794 --> 39:57.796
(sighs)

40:07.806 --> 40:10.709
(keys clacking)

40:10.742 --> 40:12.744
Hey.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.413
About earlier...

40:16.181 --> 40:17.683
I'm sorry.

40:17.716 --> 40:19.751
Who you text is your business.

40:23.822 --> 40:25.624
He's my study partner.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.794
Henry.

40:28.827 --> 40:30.796
Study partner?

40:30.829 --> 40:34.132
Oh, uh, a'ight.
(chuckles)

40:34.165 --> 40:36.201
Study partner.

40:36.234 --> 40:39.738
No, Nelson.
We-we actually study together.

40:39.771 --> 40:42.240
For our GED.

40:42.273 --> 40:45.043
Isn't that for people
who didn't finish high school?

40:45.076 --> 40:48.246
Well, I faked my high school
diploma a few years back.

40:48.279 --> 40:51.249
Didn't matter
when I was hacking, but...

40:51.282 --> 40:54.486
now it's, um...

40:54.520 --> 40:55.521
White hat rubbing off on you?

40:55.554 --> 40:59.124
Yeah. Something like that.

40:59.157 --> 41:02.628
It's just something
that I need to do for...

41:02.661 --> 41:03.895
for me.

41:03.929 --> 41:06.765
Right.
And I'd

41:06.798 --> 41:08.800
appreciate it if you could, uh,

41:08.834 --> 41:10.736
keep it on the D.L.

41:10.769 --> 41:12.538
Oh, girl.
(scoffs)

41:12.571 --> 41:15.541
You know me, I'm the king
of keeping things on the D.L.

41:15.574 --> 41:16.675
Oh, you're
the king, huh?

41:16.708 --> 41:18.009
NELSON:
You know I'm the king.

41:18.043 --> 41:20.211
I've come to bid you good night.

41:20.245 --> 41:22.080
I'd say
"sleep tight,"

41:22.113 --> 41:24.049
but I know that's easier
said than done

41:24.082 --> 41:26.084
these days.
Come on,

41:26.117 --> 41:28.554
that's it?
No meditation exercise?

41:28.587 --> 41:31.523
No stinky
insomnia tea?

41:31.557 --> 41:32.824
You're giving up on me?

41:32.858 --> 41:33.592
Yep.

41:33.625 --> 41:35.527
Did you reschedule
your big date?

41:35.561 --> 41:37.663
Oh, yeah. Uh, no, not exactly.

41:37.696 --> 41:40.532
Apparently the good
old-fashioned excuse

41:40.566 --> 41:42.734
"I had to work"
is no longer believable.

41:42.768 --> 41:44.670
(laughs)
Oh...

41:44.703 --> 41:46.872
What about you?
When's your next

41:46.905 --> 41:49.741
shrimp cocktail
with Director Silver?
I tried

41:49.775 --> 41:52.744
to reschedule a sit-down, but
apparently he's still mad at me

41:52.778 --> 41:55.614
for not taking
the deputy director job.

41:55.647 --> 41:58.550
Aw. Well, we're a couple
of sad sacks, aren't we?

41:58.584 --> 41:59.751
Mmm.

41:59.785 --> 42:02.320
Look at those two.

42:02.353 --> 42:03.789
They're not
even trying

42:03.822 --> 42:06.324
to hide it anymore.
(laughs)

42:06.357 --> 42:09.327
You know, I've been, uh...
I've been thinking about

42:09.360 --> 42:12.831
this whole Nelven thing.
I think we can do better.

42:12.864 --> 42:15.634
How 'bout... It's,
uh, Brody Nelson

42:15.667 --> 42:17.769
and-and Raven Ramirez,
right?

42:17.803 --> 42:19.204
What about...

42:19.237 --> 42:20.338
Relson?

42:20.371 --> 42:21.673
(laughs)
No, no.
Okay, okay, okay.

42:21.707 --> 42:22.974
Wait, wait.

42:23.008 --> 42:26.277
(chuckles)
No, no. Ramelson?

42:26.311 --> 42:27.879
(laughing):
No.

42:27.913 --> 42:28.980
Bromirez.

42:29.014 --> 42:32.283
Braven. Braven.

42:32.317 --> 42:34.820
Braven. Oh, that...

42:34.853 --> 42:37.322
that's good. Braven.

42:38.924 --> 42:40.992
Night, Braven!

42:41.026 --> 42:42.027
They can't hear you.
(laughs)
I hope not.
