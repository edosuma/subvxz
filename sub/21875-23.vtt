00:08.970 --> 00:10.440
( crying )

00:10.440 --> 00:12.640
Oh, did you miss me,
sweet pea?

00:12.640 --> 00:15.310
I missed you. I thought
about you all day.

00:15.310 --> 00:17.680
How's Mama's
pretty Alice?

00:17.680 --> 00:19.110
( laughs )

00:19.120 --> 00:21.010
I think about
this face all day.

00:21.020 --> 00:23.620
I can't believe something
so sweet belongs to me.

00:23.620 --> 00:25.750
You should keep you
mind on class, Laurie.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.760
Hey, I got an A
on my World History final.

00:27.760 --> 00:29.390
You'll see, I'll graduate
with honors.

00:29.390 --> 00:32.930
It won't be easy, but sweet pea
and I are going to college.

00:32.930 --> 00:34.960
Honey, I don't doubt it
for a minute.

00:34.960 --> 00:36.430
( laughs )

00:36.430 --> 00:37.770
Come on. Are you ready?

00:37.770 --> 00:38.770
Come on.
Bye.

00:38.770 --> 00:40.070
Let's go, okay?

00:40.070 --> 00:41.070
Let's go home.

01:11.870 --> 01:13.200

01:27.650 --> 01:29.650
( baby babbling )

01:44.700 --> 01:49.500
Oh, that's a good girl.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.440
Okay.

01:52.610 --> 01:54.810

( Alice gurgles )

02:29.950 --> 02:32.480
( crying )

02:38.950 --> 02:40.990
Sweet pea,
you awake already?

02:47.530 --> 02:49.160
Oh-- Oh, God.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.260
( panting )

02:50.270 --> 02:53.000
Oh, God.
Oh, God, no.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.500
( sobbing ):
Oh, God.

02:56.170 --> 02:58.910
No.
Oh, God.

02:58.910 --> 03:01.310
Please, God, no.

03:01.310 --> 03:02.610
No.

03:02.610 --> 03:04.880
( sobbing ):
Oh, my baby.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.610
My baby!

03:08.650 --> 03:12.120
(<i> light rock action theme</i>

03:58.330 --> 04:02.170
( band playing
classical piano music )

04:11.080 --> 04:14.380
I think he'll make a wonderful
candidate, don't you?

04:14.380 --> 04:16.279
Yes, it's time
that this city

04:16.279 --> 04:18.350
had a mayor
of Garrett's stature.

04:23.320 --> 04:24.730
Hey.
Hi.

04:24.730 --> 04:27.930
So, uh, what do you think
about my new tuxedo?

04:27.930 --> 04:30.060
It's nice, Trivette.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.330
You're the first Ranger I've
ever known to own one though.

04:32.330 --> 04:33.430
Yeah, but--

04:33.440 --> 04:35.600
But see how much better mine
looks than yours?

04:35.600 --> 04:36.600
How much did it cost?

04:36.610 --> 04:37.800
What?

04:37.810 --> 04:40.140
How much did it cost?
Ooh, girl, look what I see.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.380
Eleven hundred dollars.

04:42.380 --> 04:45.580
What?
Eleven hundred dollars.

04:45.580 --> 04:47.810
You paid $1,100 for--?

04:47.820 --> 04:49.380
( Walker chuckles )

04:49.390 --> 04:50.750
I can think
of a lot of things

04:50.750 --> 04:53.490
I'd rather spend 1,100 bucks
on than a new tuxedo.

04:53.490 --> 04:54.790
You have no style.
WOMAN: Hi.

04:54.790 --> 04:56.820
Hi.
Hi.

04:57.690 --> 05:00.190
Oh, no.
Ah. Ah.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.560
I'm sorry. I--
I'll get it.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.600
( chuckling )

05:03.600 --> 05:05.400
I may not have
any style, Trivette,

05:05.400 --> 05:08.270
but I've
got a clean tuxedo.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.900
( clicking )

05:10.910 --> 05:12.570
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could, uh, ahem,

05:12.570 --> 05:13.770
please have your attention.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.340
I give you a man

05:15.340 --> 05:17.010
that we all, uh, appreciate

05:17.010 --> 05:19.180
and admire.

05:19.180 --> 05:22.480
The man that we're here
this evening to honor.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.690
And that, of course, is our
Big Pal man of the year,

05:25.690 --> 05:27.590
Mr. Garrett Carlson.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.990
You be sure
to cover this, now.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.430
No kidding,
this is the stuff

05:36.430 --> 05:38.270
election-winning campaign
spots are made of.

05:38.270 --> 05:40.100
That's the only kind
I'm interested in, buddy.

05:44.770 --> 05:46.410
Thank you.
Thank you all very much.

05:46.410 --> 05:47.740
Well, I've--

05:47.740 --> 05:51.750
I've known many thrilling
moments in my career.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.480
I've hosted royalty on
behalf of our city.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.850
I've been honored
with the keys to our city.

05:55.850 --> 05:58.020
But to be acknowledged

05:58.020 --> 06:00.920
for my work on behalf
of the Big Pal program--

06:01.720 --> 06:02.960
Mr. Carlson!

06:05.130 --> 06:09.630
--is truly the crowning
achievement of my career.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.300
Mr. Carlson, listen to me!

06:11.300 --> 06:12.470
LISTENER:
Shh.

06:12.470 --> 06:14.870
There are currently
1,000 fatherless boys

06:14.870 --> 06:16.170
waiting for big pals.

06:16.170 --> 06:18.640
I want my baby back,
Mr. Carlson!

06:18.640 --> 06:19.640
She's my baby,

06:19.640 --> 06:21.310
not yours!

06:21.310 --> 06:22.780
Why do you want my baby?

06:22.780 --> 06:24.910
She belongs to me!
She's all I've got!

06:24.910 --> 06:27.150
Uh, could someone
call security, please.

06:27.150 --> 06:28.610
I don't want
to cause trouble.

06:28.620 --> 06:32.720
I just want my baby back,
please? Please!

06:33.960 --> 06:36.290
Miss, I don't know
what the problem is,

06:36.290 --> 06:37.620
but this is not
the time or place.

06:37.630 --> 06:40.660
Now, come on.
He's got my baby.

06:40.660 --> 06:42.400
Heh, wouldn't be
a Carlson speech

06:42.400 --> 06:43.800
without a rabble-rouser,
you know.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.670
( audience laughs )

06:45.670 --> 06:47.730
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

06:56.280 --> 06:57.480
Carlson's asked me

06:57.480 --> 07:00.410
if there was anything
I could do to help.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.580
Alex, this
is Laurie Maston.

07:02.580 --> 07:05.790
Her baby was stolen about
a month ago in San Antone and...

07:05.790 --> 07:06.790
she seems to think

07:06.790 --> 07:08.390
the Carlsons' baby
is hers.

07:08.390 --> 07:10.420
I saw this picture
of Mr. and Mrs. Carlson

07:10.430 --> 07:13.590
and of their adopted baby
in the newspaper last week.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.730
She's mine.

07:16.730 --> 07:18.970
You can see
they're the same.

07:20.640 --> 07:21.640
What do you think?

07:21.640 --> 07:22.640
Hard to tell

07:22.640 --> 07:23.640
from
the pictures, huh?

07:23.640 --> 07:25.840
Not to a mother.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.810
I know my baby.

07:27.810 --> 07:29.410
Those are
Alice's dimples.

07:30.650 --> 07:32.050
I love those dimples.

07:32.050 --> 07:34.450
Laurie, I can't
begin to imagine

07:34.450 --> 07:36.550
how horrible it is
to lose your child.

07:38.220 --> 07:40.720
But the Carlsons' baby
can't possibly be yours.

07:40.720 --> 07:43.860
They adopted her through
a very reputable agency.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.630
When I got pregnant,

07:48.630 --> 07:51.160
my folks said I made
a real mess out of my life.

07:51.170 --> 07:54.170
They kicked
me out.

07:54.170 --> 07:56.170
And I didn't know
what to do, where to go.

07:56.170 --> 07:59.410
I was really confused.

07:59.410 --> 08:01.010
But when Alice was born,

08:01.010 --> 08:04.010
I promised her I would
always take care of her.

08:04.010 --> 08:05.010
No matter what,

08:05.010 --> 08:07.050
I would never
leave her.

08:07.050 --> 08:09.280
(<i> sad, slow theme playing</i> )

08:09.280 --> 08:10.520
Laurie...

08:12.050 --> 08:15.060
We can't promise you
anything, but...

08:15.060 --> 08:16.920
we'll look
into it for you.

08:21.730 --> 08:23.460
GARRETT:
You know, that's
absurd, Walker.

08:24.330 --> 08:25.330
That crazy little girl

08:25.330 --> 08:27.370
should have been
put away last night.

08:27.370 --> 08:28.570
Well, she's
very distraught.

08:28.570 --> 08:29.900
And all I want to do

08:29.900 --> 08:31.900
is put her mind at ease
that this is not her child.

08:31.910 --> 08:33.940
Well, I don't see
how we can help.

08:33.940 --> 08:36.710
And I'm not sure I want to
after she humiliated us.

08:36.710 --> 08:38.039
Oh, she's just a kid,
Mr. Carlson.

08:38.049 --> 08:39.549
And she's been through a lot.

08:39.549 --> 08:41.480
Maybe we could take a look
at the adoption papers.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.850
Well, adoption papers
aren't something

08:43.850 --> 08:45.420
that you show someone
off the street.

08:45.420 --> 08:46.520
They're legal,

08:46.520 --> 08:47.520
and sealed by the court.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.190
It's our own
very private matter.

08:49.190 --> 08:51.220
I don't have to answer
to anyone about it.

08:51.230 --> 08:53.330
We could make this
a formal investigation.

08:53.330 --> 08:55.260
Walker,
I'm about to embark

08:55.260 --> 08:58.930
on the most important stage
of my career.

08:58.930 --> 09:00.670
This is a headache
I do not need.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.940
A simple blood test would
clear this whole matter up.

09:02.940 --> 09:03.970
You don't give up,
do you?

09:06.270 --> 09:07.510
All right.

09:07.510 --> 09:08.710
You get your blood test.

09:08.710 --> 09:10.380
You know, someone once said
that all babies

09:10.380 --> 09:11.740
look like
Winston Churchill,

09:11.750 --> 09:14.610
but yours bears an amazing
resemblance to Laurie's.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.650
You know, after all I have done
for this city,

09:16.650 --> 09:19.350
I resent having two
uninvited civil servants

09:19.350 --> 09:20.590
confront me at home!

09:20.590 --> 09:24.120
We'll arrange
for the test this afternoon.

09:34.170 --> 09:35.800
Civil servants.

09:36.800 --> 09:39.710
I've been
called worse.

09:42.010 --> 09:43.440
( sighs )

09:45.010 --> 09:46.680
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

09:46.680 --> 09:49.950
Garrett, I have done
everything your way.

09:49.950 --> 09:52.850
Dried out, even became mother
to a child I did not want

09:52.850 --> 09:54.490
so that you would look good
for the press!

09:54.490 --> 09:57.120
I can't very well run a campaign
based on family values

09:57.130 --> 09:59.060
without a family,
now, can I?

09:59.060 --> 10:00.290
At the very least,

10:00.300 --> 10:02.600
you could allow me
one moment of weakness, please.

10:02.600 --> 10:03.960
It was your weakness
that caused us

10:03.970 --> 10:05.400
to be turned down
in the first place,

10:05.400 --> 10:07.870
so don't tell me
about your weakness!

10:07.870 --> 10:09.270
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

10:09.270 --> 10:10.600
I hate
your damn weakness!

10:14.540 --> 10:16.910
( sighs )

10:18.310 --> 10:19.850
( people chattering )

10:22.220 --> 10:23.620
C.D.:
Mabel.

10:23.620 --> 10:26.890
You're gonna kill somebody
with that damn thing!

10:26.890 --> 10:29.490
Seeing as you're slower than
spit in a freeze with my lunch,

10:29.490 --> 10:32.060
I gotta do something
to pass the time.

10:32.060 --> 10:35.000
Why don't you just get you
some spectacles and put them on.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.200
Well, if I did that, C.D.,
I could see you better.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.770
Just might ruin everything.

10:39.770 --> 10:41.500
( chuckling )

10:42.970 --> 10:44.170
Okay, here we go.

10:44.170 --> 10:47.910
A BLT, Braunschweiger,
liverwurst and tuna.

10:47.910 --> 10:49.210
Thanks, C.D.

10:49.210 --> 10:50.240
Well, did you
see Alice?

10:50.250 --> 10:51.510
Are they taking
good care of her?

10:51.510 --> 10:53.250
Yeah, she was asleep
when we were there.

10:53.250 --> 10:54.350
( sighs )

10:54.350 --> 10:56.450
Sweat pea's
a good sleeper.

10:56.450 --> 10:57.450
Slept through the night

10:57.450 --> 10:58.750
at two months.

10:58.750 --> 11:00.620
Laurie, maybe you shouldn't
get your hopes up.

11:00.620 --> 11:01.850
They're already
on cloud nine.

11:01.860 --> 11:04.590
I know it's Alice.

11:04.590 --> 11:06.630
Well...

11:06.630 --> 11:08.790
the blood test results.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.660
It's your baby.

11:11.670 --> 11:12.870
I knew it, ha!

11:12.870 --> 11:14.530
LAURIE ( whispers ):
I knew it.

11:14.540 --> 11:17.200
ALEX:
I haven't told
the Carlsons yet.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.640
I'm not exactly
sure how.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.270
Well, when can I
have her back?

11:20.280 --> 11:22.280
We're gonna have to do this
by the book.

11:22.280 --> 11:25.110
So if you could
just be patient, okay?

11:25.110 --> 11:26.680
Okay.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.350
I can't wait to get out
of that crummy motel.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.520
ALEX:
I know the Carlsons

11:30.520 --> 11:31.720
wouldn't steal a baby.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.320
I know that
like I know my own name.

11:33.320 --> 11:34.790
There's something
wrong somewhere.

11:34.790 --> 11:37.520
Well, let's start
with the adoption agency.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.790
We'll need a court order.

11:38.790 --> 11:39.990
You got it.

11:40.860 --> 11:41.860
WOMAN:
Here you go.

11:41.860 --> 11:42.900
( Mabel laughing )

11:44.730 --> 11:47.130
I paid you $100,000

11:47.140 --> 11:51.040
to guarantee that there'd
be no problems.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.370
Having that girl show up
is a problem, Stedler.

11:53.370 --> 11:55.640
And I'm a problem-solver.

11:55.640 --> 11:56.910
Your wife's a drunk,
Carlson.

11:56.910 --> 11:58.510
There isn't adoption agency
in the state

11:58.510 --> 11:59.880
that would have let you
have a baby.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.510
I took care of that.
I'll take care of this.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.550
You didn't mention anything
about stealing a baby.

12:03.550 --> 12:05.680
Hey, you said you needed a kid
in time for the primaries.

12:05.690 --> 12:07.350
You didn't care how I did it.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.260
Besides, you got adoption papers
to prove it's all legal.

12:10.260 --> 12:11.690
The girl is out of it.

12:11.690 --> 12:14.330
Yeah. Well, maybe some extra
money will keep her out.

12:14.330 --> 12:16.330
Oh, you don't pay
the little slut.

12:16.330 --> 12:17.960
Just go on with your life.
I'll talk to her.

12:18.830 --> 12:20.730
All right, fine.
You talk to her.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.140
You take care of it.

12:22.140 --> 12:24.670
Because if you don't,
I'll take care of you.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.610
You understand?

12:26.610 --> 12:29.880
I hear you...
loud and clear, Mr. Carlson.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.140
You better.

12:38.020 --> 12:39.190
Trivette.
Yeah?

12:39.190 --> 12:41.190
I've got
the court order.

12:41.190 --> 12:42.760
All right.

12:42.760 --> 12:43.920
Hey, I checked out
that agency

12:43.930 --> 12:45.160
the Carlsons used.

12:45.160 --> 12:46.490
Yeah.
It's on the up and up.

12:46.490 --> 12:48.890
Family Dreams has been licensed
in the state for ten years.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.460
No actions
ever filed against it.

12:52.770 --> 12:55.400
( footsteps )

13:04.280 --> 13:06.580
STEDLER:
Laurie Maston...

13:06.580 --> 13:08.550
poor troubled girl.

13:08.550 --> 13:09.980
( knock on door )
Come in.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.850
Thank you,
Leanne.

13:13.860 --> 13:16.890
Make a copy this court order,
and put it in the file.

13:16.890 --> 13:18.890
Certainly.

13:20.030 --> 13:22.700
Uh, okay,
it's all here.

13:22.700 --> 13:25.100
Please.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.400
A relinquishing order.

13:26.400 --> 13:29.000
By which the birth mother
gave up parental rights.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.240
Signed by Laurie,
notarized.

13:32.870 --> 13:34.610
Copy of her
driver's license.

13:34.610 --> 13:35.880
Copy of the prenatal
agreement.

13:38.950 --> 13:40.180
Baby's hospital records.

13:40.180 --> 13:41.310
Looks like
it's all in order.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.120
WALKER:
Tell me something...

13:43.120 --> 13:46.050
How much does it cost
to adopt a child?

13:46.050 --> 13:48.120
Twenty thousand dollars.

13:48.120 --> 13:51.090
I know that may sound like
a lot, but it covers everything

13:51.090 --> 13:54.190
from screening perspective
parents to filing documents

13:54.200 --> 13:59.770
to legal fees and counseling,
prenatal care, overhead.

13:59.770 --> 14:01.130
( chuckles )

14:01.140 --> 14:03.240
You don't get into this business
to get rich.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.710
A placement that works.

14:05.710 --> 14:07.870
That's our reward.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.510
Unfortunately,
this isn't the first time

14:09.510 --> 14:10.880
I've seen a young mother

14:10.880 --> 14:12.010
regret
her decision.

14:12.010 --> 14:14.010
What if she changes her mind
and wants her back?

14:14.020 --> 14:15.180
In the state of Texas,

14:15.180 --> 14:16.980
once a mother signs
a relinquishing order,

14:16.980 --> 14:18.020
that's it.

14:18.020 --> 14:19.350
There's no recourse.

14:19.350 --> 14:21.920
( sighs )

14:21.920 --> 14:23.390
I feel bad for Laurie.

14:23.390 --> 14:25.560
She's didn't have
an easy time of it.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.730
Well,
thanks for your time.

14:26.730 --> 14:27.960
My pleasure.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.500
Thank you.

14:35.770 --> 14:37.240
( dialing )

14:39.640 --> 14:42.310
( sighs )

14:42.310 --> 14:43.340
It's me.

14:43.340 --> 14:44.910
That Maston kid surfaced.

14:44.910 --> 14:46.950
You gotta find her.

14:46.950 --> 14:49.480
How do I know
where she is?

14:49.480 --> 14:51.980
She's got no money,
so start at the fleabags.

14:54.690 --> 14:57.020
Well, maybe what happened
is Laurie changed her mind.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.990
She had no recourse.

14:58.990 --> 15:00.260
So she made up
the whole story

15:00.260 --> 15:02.660
about her baby
being stolen?

15:02.660 --> 15:04.430
Something like that.

15:04.430 --> 15:05.630
San Antonio police report

15:05.630 --> 15:08.170
was dated five days
after the adoption papers.

15:08.170 --> 15:10.200
I don't know.

15:10.200 --> 15:13.640
She seems to love
that baby an awful lot.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.210
It doesn't
seem logical to me.

15:15.210 --> 15:17.380
Yeah, but she said she was
confused during the pregnancy.

15:17.380 --> 15:20.150
She didn't know where to got,
who to turn to.

15:20.150 --> 15:22.120
Maybe adoption
seemed like the answer.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.450
Well,
let's go ask her.

15:25.350 --> 15:27.650
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

15:49.710 --> 15:50.910
( screaming )

15:53.050 --> 15:56.180
Time to practice
your penmanship, kiddo.

15:56.180 --> 15:58.550
Got a nice little goodbye
typed out here for you.

15:58.550 --> 15:59.550
Sign it here.

15:59.550 --> 16:00.790
Sign it now!

16:00.790 --> 16:03.320
Listen, sign
this damn...

16:03.320 --> 16:04.920
( crying )

16:11.030 --> 16:13.270
Can you tell me where
Laurie Maston's room is?

16:13.270 --> 16:15.770
Yeah,
room 18.

16:21.380 --> 16:22.540
Let's get out of here.

16:31.850 --> 16:34.120
Laurie,
it's Ranger Walker.

16:42.260 --> 16:44.660
Call an ambulance.

16:49.970 --> 16:51.370
( engine starts )

16:52.010 --> 16:53.340
( grunts )

16:58.450 --> 17:00.010
What did you give her?
Who?

17:00.020 --> 17:01.250
( grunts )

17:01.250 --> 17:02.680
I said,
what'd you give her?

17:02.680 --> 17:05.849
I gave her what she came
looking for: crank, meth.

17:11.359 --> 17:13.190
(<i> innocent theme playing</i> )

17:20.300 --> 17:23.339
I want some straight
answers, Laurie.

17:23.339 --> 17:24.839
I told you.

17:24.839 --> 17:27.940
Those guys broke into my room
and forced me to sign the note.

17:27.940 --> 17:29.110
They said you
bought the dope,

17:29.110 --> 17:30.410
and it wasn't
the first time.

17:31.380 --> 17:33.080
And you
believe those cruds?

17:33.080 --> 17:34.710
San Antonio P.D. told us
they picked you up

17:34.720 --> 17:36.850
for possession
a couple of years back.

17:36.850 --> 17:38.250
Those charges
were dropped.

17:38.250 --> 17:39.250
What happened?

17:39.250 --> 17:40.250
( sighs )

17:40.250 --> 17:42.490
I went to a party
with my boyfriend,

17:42.490 --> 17:44.860
and the cops busted in
and arrested everybody.

17:44.860 --> 17:46.560
Now your boyfriend's doing
25 to life.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.360
I didn't know
he was dealin'.

17:53.200 --> 17:56.340
Look, that was
a long time ago.

17:56.340 --> 17:57.570
I never used hard drugs.

17:57.570 --> 17:59.810
What do you
want me to say?

17:59.810 --> 18:01.570
Maybe you should
just leave me alone.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.880
Look, Laurie, I saw a record
of the adoption.

18:03.880 --> 18:06.110
Your picture,
your medical history,

18:06.110 --> 18:08.010
your signed consent,
it was all there.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.450
That's impossible.

18:09.450 --> 18:11.380
Must have been the toughest
decision of your life,

18:11.390 --> 18:13.020
but killing yourself
is not the solution.

18:13.020 --> 18:16.420
I didn't try to kill myself!
You have to believe me!

18:16.420 --> 18:19.090
And I don't know anything
about any papers.

18:19.090 --> 18:22.460
Rich people can always
get that stuff fixed up.

18:22.460 --> 18:25.730
Look, somebody just came
in and stole my baby.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.230
They stole her!

18:33.910 --> 18:36.180
I don't know why,
but I believe her.

18:36.180 --> 18:39.580
If she's telling the truth,
then Stedler's lying.

18:39.580 --> 18:42.480
Yeah, something about this
whole thing stinks.

18:42.480 --> 18:45.120
This man's reputation
is beyond reproach.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.350
So why would he
risk it?

18:49.060 --> 18:50.090
Crank up the computer,

18:50.090 --> 18:51.490
and run a check
on this guy, will you?

18:51.490 --> 18:53.530
All right.

18:58.200 --> 18:59.360
What about
that Laurie girl?

19:00.740 --> 19:02.030
Don't worry about her.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.840
She'll be out of the picture
when you get back.

19:03.840 --> 19:06.210
You sure we should go?

19:06.210 --> 19:07.470
( sighs )

19:07.470 --> 19:08.640
The Jamisons are expecting

19:08.640 --> 19:10.210
their little bundle
of joy tomorrow.

19:10.210 --> 19:12.040
After all these agencies
turned them down,

19:12.050 --> 19:14.510
it wouldn't be right
for us to disappoint them.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.180
I don't like it.

19:16.180 --> 19:17.550
I mean, if people
are watching you,

19:17.550 --> 19:18.820
that means
they're watching us.

19:20.390 --> 19:22.220
How many of these
special adoptions

19:22.220 --> 19:24.260
we do this year,
Dolan?

19:24.260 --> 19:27.130
Ten, maybe 12.

19:27.130 --> 19:28.190
( spins gun's cylinder )

19:28.200 --> 19:31.800
At 100,000 a pop,
free and clear...

19:34.140 --> 19:36.300
...there's no way
I'm walkin' away from that.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.300
If you can't handle it...

19:37.310 --> 19:38.300
( gun cocks )

19:38.310 --> 19:39.910
...I'll find
someone who can.

19:39.910 --> 19:41.870
No, we--
We can handle it.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.310
We can handle it.

19:46.950 --> 19:48.510
Good.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.050
( gun clicks )

19:53.350 --> 19:55.920
If you leave now,
you'll be in Tulsa by 9.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.460
Here's directions and a picture
of the little girl.

20:02.060 --> 20:03.860
Have a nice trip.

20:05.070 --> 20:06.400
I'm scared.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.700
You know, we've got plenty
of money put away, Roy.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.340
Maybe we should
just head out of town

20:10.340 --> 20:11.370
and keep on driving.

20:11.370 --> 20:12.370
We could go to Idaho,

20:12.370 --> 20:14.370
get ourselves
a little place we talked--

20:14.380 --> 20:16.210
And pass up
ten grand? No.

20:16.210 --> 20:18.840
We'll go back to the the motel.
We'll lay low for the night.

20:18.850 --> 20:21.980
We'll find ourselves a kid
right here in the morning.

20:21.980 --> 20:23.950
We'll turn it over to Stedler,
and then we'll blow.

20:23.950 --> 20:26.150
If that ain't the right kid,
he'll kill us.

20:26.150 --> 20:28.250
They all look the same
at this age.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.620
Besides, by the time
he figures out what's up,

20:30.630 --> 20:32.560
we'll be long gone.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.560
Come on.

20:49.810 --> 20:51.410
Mrs. Carlson.

20:51.410 --> 20:53.180
Ah, Ranger Walker.

20:53.180 --> 20:56.550
Uh, I'm in kind of a hurry
right now.

20:56.550 --> 20:57.680
I just wanted
to let you know

20:57.690 --> 20:59.180
that Laurie Maston's
in the hospital

20:59.190 --> 21:00.790
from an overdose
of drugs.

21:00.790 --> 21:02.590
Someone tried to make it
look like a suicide.

21:02.590 --> 21:03.790
Well, my husband's sources say

21:03.790 --> 21:05.960
that she does have a history
of substance abuse.

21:05.960 --> 21:06.960
That's not true.

21:06.960 --> 21:08.090
Well,
believe what you want.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.630
It has nothing
to do with us.

21:09.630 --> 21:11.960
She is the mother
of your child.
Not anymore.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.830
She gave her up, and we paid
a lot of money for her.

21:13.830 --> 21:15.430
That baby belongs to us.

21:16.640 --> 21:18.240
Like this car?

21:18.840 --> 21:20.010
Excuse me?

21:20.010 --> 21:21.870
You paid a lot of money
for your car too.

21:23.010 --> 21:24.540
Look, Ranger,
if there's nothing else,

21:24.550 --> 21:25.540
I really have to be going.

21:25.550 --> 21:27.550
Well, there is
one other thing.

21:27.550 --> 21:29.680
What if the roles
were reversed?

21:29.680 --> 21:32.450
What if you were
in Laurie's shoes?

21:32.450 --> 21:33.890
How would you feel?

21:39.760 --> 21:41.460
( engine starts )

21:46.730 --> 21:50.100
( woman speaking indistinctly
over PA )

21:50.670 --> 21:52.140
Hello, Laurie.

21:52.140 --> 21:54.010
Do I know you?

21:54.010 --> 21:55.810
You should.

21:57.410 --> 22:00.380
I arranged for the adoption
of your baby to the Carlsons.

22:00.380 --> 22:02.450
I'm surprised
you don't remember.

22:02.450 --> 22:04.380
No.
You came to my office.

22:04.390 --> 22:05.650
You signed all the papers.

22:05.650 --> 22:08.550
You handed the baby over
all nice and legal-like.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.890
I did not. You must have forged
all that stuff or something.

22:10.890 --> 22:13.560
You agreed to give up
your baby, Laurie.

22:15.230 --> 22:17.530
Yes, yes, you did.

22:17.530 --> 22:18.930
And you lied

22:18.930 --> 22:20.370
to the Ranger.

22:22.700 --> 22:24.070
You're gonna need
more than a nurse

22:24.070 --> 22:25.170
if you don't do what I say.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.340
You listen to me.

22:28.340 --> 22:31.510
The baby belongs
to the Carlsons now.

22:34.050 --> 22:36.750
You go back
to San Antone

22:36.750 --> 22:38.380
and stay quiet,

22:38.390 --> 22:40.920
or I'll arrange for a nice
little case of crib death.

22:42.220 --> 22:43.220
You wouldn't.

22:43.220 --> 22:45.560
Oh, yes, I would.

22:51.230 --> 22:53.970
Oh, how are you, Ranger?

22:53.970 --> 22:55.430
What are you doing
here, Mr. Stedler?

22:55.440 --> 22:57.040
Oh, just came
to check on our girl.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.440
She seems like
she's doing fine.

22:59.440 --> 23:02.110
Take care, now,
little lady.

23:05.980 --> 23:07.250
You okay, Laurie?

23:07.250 --> 23:10.820
R-- Ranger Walker,
I think I better just go home

23:10.820 --> 23:12.150
and forget
this whole thing.

23:12.150 --> 23:13.290
Forget your baby?

23:13.290 --> 23:16.660
I could never forget her,
but may--

23:16.660 --> 23:19.020
I think maybe she'll be better
off with the Carlsons, you know?

23:19.030 --> 23:20.260
They're rich
and everything--

23:20.260 --> 23:22.190
I don't believe
you really mean that.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.800
( sobbing ):
I don't know
what I mean. I--

23:23.800 --> 23:25.800
I'm confused.
I just--

23:25.800 --> 23:27.800
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

23:27.800 --> 23:30.240
I'll be right back.

23:33.670 --> 23:35.370
Stedler!

23:38.050 --> 23:39.810
What can I do for you,
Ranger?

23:40.710 --> 23:41.910
What did you say
to that girl?

23:41.920 --> 23:43.750
I just reminded her
of her obligations.

23:43.750 --> 23:45.220
I think you said
more than that.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.220
Think what you like.

23:47.220 --> 23:49.590
But there's no question
she's an unfit mother.

23:49.590 --> 23:51.520
Up there in detox,
drying out.

23:51.530 --> 23:54.130
I had no idea
she had a drug problem.

23:54.130 --> 23:57.160
She's damn lucky the Carlsons
are willing to keep the kid.

23:57.160 --> 23:58.830
Did the Carlsons
tell you she was here?

23:59.630 --> 24:00.870
Why don't you ask them.

24:00.870 --> 24:02.400
I will.

24:04.970 --> 24:06.970
( playing classical music )

24:10.910 --> 24:12.410
Hi, how are you?
( babbling )

24:12.410 --> 24:13.480
Good to see you.

24:13.480 --> 24:14.850
GARRETT:
Hello, my dear.

24:14.850 --> 24:15.850
Thank you
for coming.

24:16.480 --> 24:17.480
Hey.

24:17.490 --> 24:18.820
You be sure to milk
all this stuff.

24:18.820 --> 24:19.820
It's priceless.

24:19.820 --> 24:21.320
Remember that
when you get my invoice.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.890
( laughs )
All right, guys.

24:22.890 --> 24:24.160
Right over here.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.220
Got it?
Okay.

24:25.230 --> 24:26.230
Come on.

24:26.230 --> 24:27.560
I'll be right with you.
Claudia?

24:27.560 --> 24:28.860
Over here, Claudia.
( cries )

24:28.860 --> 24:30.600
( chuckling )

24:33.130 --> 24:34.870
Ah, perfect.

24:34.870 --> 24:36.370
Perfect.

24:36.370 --> 24:37.370
I've even got

24:37.370 --> 24:38.740
the perfect
campaign slogan.

24:38.740 --> 24:39.770
Mm?

24:39.770 --> 24:41.410
"A family man
for family values."

24:41.410 --> 24:42.410
Oh.
Not bad.

24:42.410 --> 24:43.440
MAN:
Look at the camera.

24:45.550 --> 24:47.280
All right.

24:47.280 --> 24:48.910
Terrific, we got it.
Myra.

24:48.920 --> 24:52.620
Yes, ma'am.
( baby babbling )

24:52.620 --> 24:53.620
I'll take her.

24:53.620 --> 24:56.420
Goodbye,
sweetheart.

25:04.770 --> 25:07.170
Walker,
what are you doing here?

25:07.170 --> 25:09.100
I won't be staying long.

25:09.100 --> 25:10.770
Do you really think
that anybody

25:10.770 --> 25:12.770
who would steal a baby
would go to all this trouble?

25:12.770 --> 25:14.210
I think
there are men with ambitions

25:14.210 --> 25:15.840
who believe
they can buy anything.

25:15.840 --> 25:18.210
Look, Alex,
maybe you and Mrs. Carlson

25:18.210 --> 25:20.280
are so close that
you can't see things clearly.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.750
Questioning my professionalism

25:21.750 --> 25:23.050
is not the way to persuade me.

25:23.050 --> 25:25.050
And doubting my judgment
won't stop me, either.

25:25.050 --> 25:26.750
Fine. So, what
are we gonna do?

25:26.750 --> 25:28.590
What we always do.

25:28.590 --> 25:29.860
Find the truth.

25:33.090 --> 25:35.590
Oh. Alex didn't tell us
you'd be coming.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.360
She didn't know.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.470
Mr. Carlson, you and I
need to talk, outside.

25:39.470 --> 25:41.130
You're damn right we do.

25:46.710 --> 25:48.910
WAITER: Ma'am?
Oh, thank you.

25:52.510 --> 25:54.080
All right, Walker.
What's the idea

25:54.080 --> 25:55.380
of harassing
my wife yesterday?

25:55.380 --> 25:56.850
I'm just
trying to get the facts.

25:56.850 --> 25:59.350
You've got them!
The adoption is legal.

25:59.350 --> 26:00.950
I've got the damn papers
to prove it!

26:00.960 --> 26:02.690
Then why did you send Stedler
to the hospital

26:02.690 --> 26:03.860
to scare Laurie into leaving?

26:03.860 --> 26:07.490
My business
with Mr. Stedler is over.

26:07.490 --> 26:09.390
What he does now
is no concern of mine.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.930
If you give me any more
grief about this,

26:10.930 --> 26:12.160
I will ruin you.

26:12.170 --> 26:14.200
You better believe
I can do it. Now, just back off!

26:14.200 --> 26:16.370
I'll back off,
soon as I get the truth.

26:16.370 --> 26:18.800
And if the truth is you
adopted that child illegally,

26:18.810 --> 26:21.840
all the contacts in the world
aren't gonna save you.

26:23.540 --> 26:28.850
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

26:30.420 --> 26:32.020
( phone rings )

26:33.590 --> 26:34.590
Walker.

26:34.590 --> 26:36.090
Stedler was right about

26:36.090 --> 26:38.060
not getting rich on this
adoption business.

26:38.060 --> 26:40.530
Three years ago he filed
for bankruptcy, right?

26:40.530 --> 26:43.800
But magically,
he pulled it out,

26:43.800 --> 26:45.430
and he withdrew
the filing later on.

26:45.430 --> 26:46.830
And we know how.

26:46.830 --> 26:48.770
Yeah. Thanks.
Hang on.

26:52.010 --> 26:53.640
Walker, you're not
gonna like this.

26:53.640 --> 26:55.740
What?

26:58.010 --> 27:00.680
I'm going to
see her right now.

27:05.020 --> 27:07.190
( engine starts )

27:10.020 --> 27:11.460
( knocking on door )

27:17.630 --> 27:19.670
What is this about you
dropping the charges, Laurie?

27:19.670 --> 27:21.400
It's over.
I'm goin' home tomorrow.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.330
Sorry about all the trouble
I've caused you.

27:23.340 --> 27:25.070
Is someone forcing you
to do this?

27:25.070 --> 27:26.570
No one ever forces me
to do anything.

27:26.570 --> 27:28.240
So, what you're saying, then,

27:28.240 --> 27:30.040
is that you gave up
your child voluntarily?

27:30.040 --> 27:31.540
I'm sorry I lied.

27:31.550 --> 27:33.210
I just didn't know
what else to do.

27:33.210 --> 27:35.680
I mean, I couldn't take care
of her, you know. And so--

27:35.680 --> 27:38.320
Laurie, I don't believe you.

27:38.320 --> 27:40.590
That's pretty funny. I must be
a better liar than I thought.

27:40.590 --> 27:42.590
No, you're lying now.

27:42.590 --> 27:43.760
Laurie, let me help you.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.320
I've had all the help I need.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.030
I just want Alice to be okay.

27:47.030 --> 27:48.090
Did Stedler threaten you?

27:48.100 --> 27:50.430
No!
Now just leave me alone.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.870
Okay.
I'll leave you alone.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.640
But there's just one thing
I want you to think about.

27:58.640 --> 28:01.510
Think about another
young mother, just like you,

28:01.510 --> 28:03.510
who's trying
to raise her baby,

28:03.510 --> 28:05.110
with no family support,
either.

28:06.350 --> 28:08.550
Think about how she'll feel

28:08.550 --> 28:10.580
when they steal her baby.

28:12.290 --> 28:14.050
Have a nice trip.

she's gone.

It's all my fault.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.560
No, ma'am,
it is not your fault.

30:05.570 --> 30:07.000
Are you going
to find my baby?

We're gonna
do everything we can.

tried to distract you?

30:11.070 --> 30:14.770
No. I was cleaning up
the mess Brian made.

30:14.780 --> 30:17.140
I just looked away
for a few seconds.

30:17.140 --> 30:18.740
Ranger? I might
have seen something.

30:18.750 --> 30:21.210
An old car that drove real fast
out of the parking lot.

30:21.210 --> 30:23.820
I didn't think anything about it
till I heard this lady crying.

30:23.820 --> 30:25.020
Old car. What make?

30:25.020 --> 30:27.320
Well, uh, those old boats
all look the same,

30:27.320 --> 30:29.890
but this one was gray
and it had Louisiana plates.

30:29.890 --> 30:31.160

30:31.160 --> 30:33.460
Yeah. It was, uh,
789 at the end.

30:33.460 --> 30:34.760
Thanks.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.000
Do you have
a picture of your baby?

30:40.000 --> 30:41.600
Yes.

30:47.370 --> 30:49.140
Get an APB on that car,
and get the picture

And you'll bring

Hundred thousand in cash.
That's correct.

to follow that car.

What?

37:24.040 --> 37:25.740
I really can't tell you that.

37:25.740 --> 37:28.340
This is a serious
police matter, ma'am.

37:28.340 --> 37:29.870
I work for Mr. Stedler.

37:29.880 --> 37:31.780
Certainly you understand
my position.

37:31.780 --> 37:33.910
Lady, you'd better
understand our position.

37:33.910 --> 37:36.250
Your boss
is a suspected kidnapper.

Now, if you don't
want to be an accomplice,

you better start talking.

I don't know where he is,

she'd be all right.

You're not gonna

Not if you hold up

She's with one of the finest
