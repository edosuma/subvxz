WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.252
Previously on The Resident...

00:02.335 --> 00:04.254
This is my son-in-law Derek.

00:04.337 --> 00:05.964
He's been complaining
of shortness of breath.

00:06.047 --> 00:07.549
-Mom.
-And my daughter Molly.

00:07.632 --> 00:10.385
Derek has an aggressive B-cell lymphoma.

00:10.468 --> 00:12.887
You have a 50% chance at being cured.

00:12.971 --> 00:15.306
DEVON:
This is Dawn Long, the one from TV.

00:15.390 --> 00:17.308
She's not getting better,
but Cain wants her treated

00:17.392 --> 00:19.269
and sent back to the LTACH.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.521
Your patient had Candida auris.

00:21.604 --> 00:23.189
-The superbug?
-Once Candida auris

00:23.273 --> 00:24.649
spreads throughout a building,

00:24.733 --> 00:26.609
it's nearly impossible to eradicate.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.405
(sighs)

00:30.488 --> 00:32.824
(indistinct chatter)

00:32.907 --> 00:35.910
Anyone know what this is about?

00:35.994 --> 00:38.455
-Logan Kim is gonna give an announcement.
-These Red Rock speeches

00:38.538 --> 00:39.873
are starting to drive me up the wall, man.

00:39.956 --> 00:42.000
Why can't we just go back to paper memos?

00:42.083 --> 00:45.545
Ah, okay.
(chuckles)

00:45.628 --> 00:48.631
As you know, ICU nurses

00:48.715 --> 00:51.718
must chart patient data constantly.

00:51.801 --> 00:55.096
This practice is inefficient, tedious

00:55.180 --> 00:57.599
and expensive for the hospital.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.559
Today is a new day.

00:59.642 --> 01:04.064
As a trial run, these rooms
are being retrofitted

01:04.147 --> 01:07.067
with state-of-the-art
automated patient monitoring.

01:07.150 --> 01:10.111
The system is so sophisticated

01:10.195 --> 01:12.614
that it could even tell
if doctors and nurses

01:12.697 --> 01:15.241
don't wash their hands before
entering the patient room.

01:15.325 --> 01:18.578
Chastain is taking its place

01:18.661 --> 01:21.831
on the technological map in health care.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.124
(all muttering)

01:25.877 --> 01:29.047
-Staff loves that guy.
-Just wish I could hug him.

01:29.130 --> 01:31.132
Good times.

01:38.139 --> 01:39.474
Through and through.
Inside there,

01:39.557 --> 01:42.393
and the ceiling all around.
In there.

01:45.146 --> 01:47.148
(plastic crinkling)

01:57.117 --> 01:59.077
As far as anyone's concerned,

01:59.160 --> 02:01.496
we're just installing A.I. technology.

02:01.579 --> 02:04.124
No one knows we're also
eliminating a deadly fungus.

02:04.207 --> 02:07.335
Candida auris is highly dangerous

02:07.418 --> 02:09.546
in immune-compromised patients.

02:09.629 --> 02:11.172
Half the people who get it die.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.841
We're lucky it's not airborne

02:12.924 --> 02:15.301
like the coronavirus.
The staff is not at risk,

02:15.385 --> 02:16.511
but the patients could be.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.179
The protocol here

02:18.263 --> 02:20.348
is gonna be to notify
the state health authorities.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.016
-We need to follow protocol.
-You didn't mind

02:22.100 --> 02:24.853
bending protocol to keep
a vegetable on life support

02:24.936 --> 02:26.396
just to protect your stats.

02:26.479 --> 02:28.606
I kept Dawn Long alive for Red Rock.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.817
It's because of me, you can have
the Mother of All Surgeries

02:30.900 --> 02:32.777
-in the win column.
-No, you weren't helping Red Rock,

02:32.861 --> 02:34.779
you were feeding your god complex.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.072
As a result, she brought

02:36.156 --> 02:37.532
a deadly fungus into this hospital.

02:37.615 --> 02:40.034
And there was no way for me to know
that she had the superbug.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.871
It's common in nursing homes and LTACHs.

02:42.954 --> 02:44.831
Even I know that.
But you missed it.

02:44.914 --> 02:47.709
You approved or demanded
every step I took in this.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.711
According to you.

02:49.794 --> 02:51.546
I've got your back,

02:51.629 --> 02:55.341
as long as you've got mine,
and not a moment longer.

02:55.425 --> 02:58.595
-Are you threatening me?
-Get on board

02:58.678 --> 03:01.598
and help to fix this mess
or I'll tell the world

03:01.681 --> 03:03.892
what happened when you were an intern.

03:27.165 --> 03:29.584
You need to be honest with me.

03:29.667 --> 03:30.793
I haven't had any.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.420
-I promise.
-Look,

03:32.503 --> 03:34.255
we can only treat
your cardiovascular disease

03:34.339 --> 03:36.925
without surgery if you quit smoking.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.304
I haven't had a smoke
since you last saw me.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.097
Oh, so what were the cigarettes
you had this morning?

03:43.181 --> 03:45.099
MADDIE:
Reformed addicts are the worst.

03:45.183 --> 03:47.810
Yeah, I'm just looking out for you.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.854
Look, there's a sign-up table over there

03:49.938 --> 03:51.856
for a program that helps you quit.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.108
Will you just walk over?

03:54.192 --> 03:58.029
-Maybe.
-(coughing)

03:58.112 --> 04:01.282
(sniffles)
Uh, thanks for trying, Nic.

04:02.825 --> 04:04.369
Are you feeling okay?

04:04.452 --> 04:06.454
I'm good.

04:06.537 --> 04:08.873
Well, let me just...

04:11.584 --> 04:13.336
Your heart's racing, you're coughing.

04:13.419 --> 04:16.172
Any muscle weakness, headaches?

04:16.256 --> 04:18.174
Yes, to all of the above.
But before you say it...

04:18.258 --> 04:21.094
I think we should get you to Chastain.

04:21.177 --> 04:24.555
I'm not gonna go.
You know what my insurance deductible is.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.391
Come on, people like me
only go to the hospital

04:26.474 --> 04:28.226
-as a last resort.
-Right,

04:28.309 --> 04:30.061
but I think this is one of those moments.

04:30.144 --> 04:31.813
Come on, let's get you to a doctor.

04:31.896 --> 04:33.815
Look at the all the people
who need you to stay healthy.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.484
Come on.

04:43.491 --> 04:45.410
You rang?

04:45.493 --> 04:46.828
We've got a case.

04:46.911 --> 04:49.122
45-year-old female suffering from fever,

04:49.205 --> 04:51.207
joint pain, chills and diarrhea.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.834
Well, that's all painfully nonspecific.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.460
She could have anything.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.629
Yeah, which makes this
the perfect medical mystery

04:56.713 --> 04:58.631
and teaching tool for you.

04:58.715 --> 05:03.303
You mean it's full of grunt work
you don't want to do.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.930
-See? You're learning already.
-(sighs)

05:06.014 --> 05:08.141
Sophia, these are
Drs. Pravesh and Dreyfuss.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.976
They're gonna help me
with your care today.

05:10.059 --> 05:12.353
Great, 'cause I could use
all the help I can get.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.856
Sophia, it's nice to meet you.
I've seen you around.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.899
-You're an EMT, right?
-Guilty.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.235
I had to take the day off, though,
'cause I got this bug.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.903
Good thing you did.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.948
Your ketone and glucose levels
are sky-high.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.992
You're in diabetic ketoacidosis.

05:26.075 --> 05:28.369
How does an EMT not understand
how dangerous it is

05:28.453 --> 05:31.289
to let her sugars get out of whack?

05:31.372 --> 05:32.665
DEVON:
You'll have to forgive Dr. Dreyfuss.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.709
He has an issue of his own.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.252
His mouth moves
before his brain catches up.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.795
(laughs softly)
It's all right.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.422
I deserve the judgment.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.091
I should be monitoring
my blood sugar more closely.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.509
CONRAD:
Uh, your diabetes diagnosis

05:43.593 --> 05:44.927
is recent.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.763
Lifestyle adjustments, they take time.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.140
See what he did there?

05:49.223 --> 05:50.516
SOPHIA:
So,

05:50.600 --> 05:52.560
-what's the plan?
-CONRAD: An X-ray

05:52.643 --> 05:54.562
and empiric antibiotics.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.397
I'll go check on your blood
and urine cultures, okay?

05:56.481 --> 05:59.400
-Thanks, Dr. Hawkins.
-You got it.

05:59.484 --> 06:02.612
Now, Dr. Dreyfuss, what do you recommend

06:02.695 --> 06:04.447
for her diabetic ketoacidosis?

06:04.530 --> 06:07.658
An insulin drip
until her anion gap closes.

06:07.742 --> 06:11.120
Along with aggressive hydration
and dextrose to keep her glucose

06:11.204 --> 06:12.955
from dropping too precipitously.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.333
And the kid redeems himself.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.064
I love unicorns.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.526
(gloves snapping)

06:44.654 --> 06:46.447
Excuse me.

06:46.531 --> 06:49.158
Has this vent been used
in the last 24 hours?

06:49.242 --> 06:52.328
No, it's been down here
for the decontamination process.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.913
Okay, good. Clean it now.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.206
Like, right now.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.376
-Okay.
-KIM: Hey.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.461
I need to talk to you.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.926
(alarm beeping)

07:08.052 --> 07:10.263
-Lunch. Half hour.
-(indistinct chatter)

07:10.346 --> 07:12.265
KIM:
What were you doing in there?

07:12.348 --> 07:14.267
CAIN: I'm making sure
they cleaned Dawn Long's vent.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.727
Don't want one more person
getting the superbug.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.354
It might be too late for that.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.356
I had one of our I.T. guys
ping any patients

07:20.440 --> 07:22.733
who might have had contact with Dawn Long.

07:22.817 --> 07:26.654
They got a hit
with this new admit Sophia Masters.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.532
She's one of the EMTs
who brought Dawn here,

07:29.615 --> 07:30.950
and she has fever,
joint pain and diarrhea.

07:31.033 --> 07:32.702
That could mean a number of things.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.245
Health care providers aren't at risk

07:34.328 --> 07:36.456
unless they have
a compromised immune system.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.212
According to her charts, she also has

07:43.296 --> 07:46.257
poorly managed diabetes,
which would check that box.

07:46.340 --> 07:47.675
Who's her doctor?

07:47.758 --> 07:49.760
Conrad Hawkins.

07:49.844 --> 07:53.431
The whistleblower
you let back into our house?

07:53.514 --> 07:55.933
He finds out, he will definitely
trace it back to Dawn.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.768
You have to handle this.

07:57.852 --> 08:01.105
If it gets out now that we have
a deadly fungus at Chastain,

08:01.189 --> 08:03.483
this hospital goes bankrupt.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.402
Which is why I'll handle it.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.777
-It's on me.
-Oh, wow.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.196
Thanks, Dr. Cain,
but you don't have to do that.

08:50.279 --> 08:52.615
Always here to help
a struggling young intern.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.450
Well, um, thanks again.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.744
You've done so much for me, and my mom.

08:56.827 --> 08:58.955
Well, no more than she did for me.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.957
Hey, you got a few? Let's walk.

09:03.459 --> 09:06.337
You know, your mother is one of
the finest nurses I've ever met.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.838
-How's she been?
-Oh. S-She-- Well,

09:07.922 --> 09:09.465
she's-she's, uh, she's much better

09:09.549 --> 09:12.260
now that you've, uh,
recommended her for that new job.

09:12.343 --> 09:13.928
Oh, good. Good.
Do you know that

09:14.011 --> 09:15.263
she helped me when I was an intern?

09:15.346 --> 09:16.889
No, I didn't know that. How?

09:16.973 --> 09:20.101
Well, nurses, they teach interns
more than anyone,

09:20.184 --> 09:22.311
and she was so generous to me.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.480
-Oh.
-She's why I wrote

09:24.564 --> 09:26.732
the recommendation for you
to match here at Chastain.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.735
Oh, well, uh, I-I wouldn't be here
without you.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.821
(chuckles)
Well, that's very true, very true.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.948
Please, want to step in?

09:36.492 --> 09:37.660
Mm.

09:42.623 --> 09:44.750
I need a small favor.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.502
Uh, sure. Uh, a-anything.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.546
Now, I understand that
you're working with Dr. Hawkins

09:48.629 --> 09:50.756
-on an EMT patient named Sophia.
-Mm-hmm.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.800
I'm worried that she has Candida auris.

09:52.883 --> 09:54.552
Candida auris?

09:54.635 --> 09:57.221
That-that has a mortality rate above 50%.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.765
Yeah, well, it's-it's just a hunch.

10:01.267 --> 10:05.021
Sophia transported my patient
Dawn Long here from LTACH.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.148
What, did your patient have it?

10:07.231 --> 10:09.984
I don't know for certain.

10:10.067 --> 10:13.404
You know, but looking back, uh,
I believe that could be

10:13.487 --> 10:16.198
the reason why Dawn's final illness

10:16.282 --> 10:18.409
didn't respond to the antibiotics.

10:18.492 --> 10:20.745
Well, we need to tell Dr. Hawkins.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.538
Well, no, that can't happen.

10:22.622 --> 10:26.459
Because if I'm right about this,
it all stems from my mistake.

10:26.542 --> 10:29.462
I misdiagnosed a patient,

10:29.545 --> 10:32.214
and let me tell you,
I am beating myself up about that.

10:32.298 --> 10:35.509
So my-my hope is to fix it,

10:35.593 --> 10:40.723
but quietly, by making sure
Sophia gets antifungals.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.808
I just need to make sure

10:42.892 --> 10:45.728
that you can treat Sophia
without Hawkins finding out.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.356
What-- Are-- You're serious?
I, um...

10:48.439 --> 10:49.982
Dr. Cain, what you're asking...

10:50.066 --> 10:53.694
Is a big, big favor.
I know that.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.905
But it repays a pretty big debt.

10:58.157 --> 11:03.037
And I know that you'll help me...
because I helped you.

11:11.128 --> 11:13.964
-Ezra.
-What are you doing?

11:15.383 --> 11:17.301
Did something happen to Sophia?

11:17.385 --> 11:19.303
CONRAD:
Her MRSA and VRE screens were negative.

11:19.387 --> 11:20.846
Well, given her symptoms,
I thought it could be

11:20.930 --> 11:22.431
a-a C. diff infection.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.016
-Why didn't you page us?
-I should have. I-I'm sorry.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.311
I just, I guess I--
my-my OCD got the best of me.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.814
I started thinking about the germs
and then-- uh, you know,

11:29.897 --> 11:32.274
I had no idea that, uh,
sending stool for C. diff

11:32.358 --> 11:33.484
would trigger isolation protocols.

11:33.567 --> 11:36.445
CONRAD:
Look, interns overcall

11:36.529 --> 11:38.698
C. diff all the time.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.991
Since when are you the good cop?

11:41.075 --> 11:42.743
When it's not my intern.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.203
Because of what you did, Ezra,

11:44.286 --> 11:45.830
Sophia will have to remain in isolation

11:45.913 --> 11:48.040
until her stool sample
comes back negative.

11:48.124 --> 11:51.794
Again, so sorry.
I-I didn't realize.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.087
(chuckles softly)

11:55.256 --> 11:58.092
Fine. OCD or not...

12:00.094 --> 12:04.098
...you're going in there
and checking in on our patient.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.226
Hi, Isaac.

12:07.309 --> 12:11.731
This is Dr. Austin,
our very best cardiothoracic surgeon.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.275
Oh, I need a surgeon now?

12:14.358 --> 12:17.236
(chuckles)
Woof. That can't be good.

12:17.319 --> 12:19.655
-Or cheap.
-AUSTIN: Wow, Nic was right about you.

12:19.739 --> 12:23.325
-You are a charmer.
-Um, why are you here?

12:23.409 --> 12:26.245
Well, you have some scarring
and other signs on your CT

12:26.328 --> 12:28.330
that suggest you have a lung disease

12:28.414 --> 12:30.332
called pulmonary fibrosis.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.835
It's the reason you've been
having a hard time breathing.

12:34.920 --> 12:39.467
I was homeless for a while
myself when I was a teenager.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.303
(clears throat)
Did I get this from living on the streets?

12:42.386 --> 12:43.804
No, not in this case.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.265
In this case,
it's more likely it's genetic.

12:46.348 --> 12:47.683
Premature gray hair

12:47.767 --> 12:50.436
is a rare genetic manifestation
of the disease.

12:50.519 --> 12:55.858
So... I got this from my family?

12:55.941 --> 12:58.694
Wow, I've never seen a patient

12:58.778 --> 13:00.571
so happy about inheriting a disease.

13:00.654 --> 13:02.448
Probably because most of your patients

13:02.531 --> 13:04.450
know where they came from.

13:04.533 --> 13:07.995
My parents dropped me off
at a fire station after I was born.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.790
I was raised in foster care.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.626
And, uh, I've waited my whole life

13:13.709 --> 13:17.129
to learn any scrap of information
about them.

13:18.380 --> 13:22.176
So this is like Christmas for me.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.261
Uh, tell me there's a cure

13:24.345 --> 13:26.680
for pulmonary fibrosis
under the tree, too.

13:26.764 --> 13:30.309
Uh, I'm sorry, Isaac.

13:30.392 --> 13:34.480
I'm worried the damage to your lungs
cannot be repaired.

13:34.563 --> 13:36.774
We're gonna try to ease
your symptoms with medication,

13:36.857 --> 13:38.192
-but, um...
-But we need to take a biopsy

13:38.275 --> 13:40.820
of your lungs to be certain.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.282
(sniffles, clears throat)

13:55.918 --> 13:57.586
What's wrong?

13:57.670 --> 13:59.338
It's Derek.

13:59.421 --> 14:01.841
I thought he was doing better.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.676
He was.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.387
But then one cough led to another,

14:06.470 --> 14:09.014
and before we knew it,
shortness of breath.

14:09.098 --> 14:12.810
I discussed it with Conrad,
and it's Derek's lungs.

14:12.893 --> 14:16.438
He has diffuse bilateral crackles.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.607
Pulmonary edema?

14:18.691 --> 14:21.610
He thinks so.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.446
Derek's gained five pounds
of fluid since chemo,

14:24.530 --> 14:25.906
and his kidneys
still haven't bounced back.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.950
Well, haven't they given him diuretics?

14:28.033 --> 14:30.160
Yes, but that might not be enough.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.872
(crying):
And if that's the case...

14:35.291 --> 14:38.294
MOLLY: They want to put you
on a ventilator to help you breathe,

14:38.377 --> 14:40.588
and hopefully allow your lungs to heal.

14:40.671 --> 14:41.797
A ventilator?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.799
For how long?

14:43.883 --> 14:46.176
There's no way of knowing.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.389
Will I be awake, able to communicate?

14:50.472 --> 14:53.309
No, we have to sedate you.

14:56.020 --> 15:01.066
And there's a chance you could
develop other complications

15:01.150 --> 15:03.903
that could prevent

15:03.986 --> 15:07.781
the breathing tube from being removed.

15:07.865 --> 15:11.452
So, when they p-put me under, there's...

15:13.454 --> 15:15.247
...there's a chance
that I might not wake up,

15:15.331 --> 15:16.957
that I might not see my family again.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.167
-Is that what you're saying?
-Shh...

15:18.250 --> 15:20.210
That's a worst-case scenario,

15:20.294 --> 15:22.379
but it's the only way
you recover lung function.

15:22.463 --> 15:26.300
Kit, there has to be another way.

15:26.383 --> 15:29.887
-There has to be another way.
-No. Honey, honey.

15:34.516 --> 15:36.936
I don't think there is.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.651
DEREK:
If I do this,

15:43.734 --> 15:45.736
I could die.

15:47.488 --> 15:53.327
If you don't do this...
you definitely will.

15:55.579 --> 15:58.457
How long can I delay being intubated?

15:58.540 --> 16:00.292
The way things are going,

16:00.376 --> 16:04.254
unless something changes,
it will need to happen soon.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.971
Okay, well, I just,
I have to see Josie one more time.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.181
-Yes. (sniffles)
-Okay, I know that we said

16:14.264 --> 16:16.350
that she needed a day a-away
from all this but...

16:16.433 --> 16:19.353
No, I'll-I'll let the babysitter
pick her up from school

16:19.436 --> 16:22.189
and bring her here immediately.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.405
EZRA:
This is a bag of antifungals.

16:29.488 --> 16:32.032
-CAIN: Yes, I'm aware.
-How did you get this?

16:32.116 --> 16:34.952
You don't get to where I am
without making a few allies.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.578
You know someone in pharmacy?

16:36.662 --> 16:38.998
No, I have someone in pharmacy.

16:39.081 --> 16:41.709
I have someone everywhere.

16:41.792 --> 16:45.546
Is Sophia still being treated
with the insulin drip and D5?

16:45.629 --> 16:48.716
-Yes.
-Here's a label for her fluids.

16:48.799 --> 16:51.218
Put it on the antifungals and hang it.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.848
Are you having doubts?

16:55.931 --> 16:58.767
No, I want to help. I, uh...

17:00.102 --> 17:02.021
Yes.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.398
Chock-full of doubts.

17:04.481 --> 17:05.983
I get it.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.901
You know, when I was an intern,

17:07.985 --> 17:09.820
I was faced with so many choices.

17:09.903 --> 17:13.198
It was all confusing.
I struggled, too.

17:13.282 --> 17:16.744
But eventually, I learned
to just do what I was told to do

17:16.827 --> 17:18.579
by the people who knew better.

17:18.662 --> 17:20.414
And I got rewarded for that.

17:20.497 --> 17:24.918
I didn't climb up the ladder,
I flew up it.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.628
That could be you, Ezra.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.731
(alarm sounding)

17:45.814 --> 17:47.024
(breathing heavily)

17:49.193 --> 17:51.737
Blood pressure 90/50,
tachycardic in the 130s.

17:51.820 --> 17:54.031
My heart, it's pounding.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.951
Ezra, check her lungs.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.578
Uh-huh.

17:59.661 --> 18:03.373
She's burning up. Temp is 101.5.

18:05.959 --> 18:08.003
Breathing sounds are diminished.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.588
She's septic.

18:09.671 --> 18:11.924
Two liters of normal saline now.

18:12.007 --> 18:15.010
Dizzy. Hot. Turn down heat.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.846
Should we start her on pressors?

18:17.930 --> 18:19.848
Let's see how she responds to volume.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.727
I'm putting her in Trendelenburg.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.899
Squeeze the bag.

18:32.069 --> 18:35.030
EZRA:
Her BP is rising.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.657
It's working.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.283
(sighs)

18:40.327 --> 18:42.204
Something is causing her to deteriorate.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.248
Yeah, but there's nothing
in her labs that's suggesting

18:44.331 --> 18:45.833
-what that could be.
-Well, something's changed.

18:45.916 --> 18:48.669
We need a new set of labs.

18:48.752 --> 18:51.672
And broaden her antibiotics, just in case.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.550
-I'll put in the orders.
-We'll have the nurse

18:54.633 --> 18:56.677
come check on you, Sophia.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.586
Hey. Ezra, what are you doing?

19:30.669 --> 19:32.546
-Hey.
-When I said, "Put in the orders,"

19:32.629 --> 19:34.965
-I meant you would.
-Yeah, right. Coming.

19:43.056 --> 19:46.727
We got the results from your lung biopsy.

19:46.810 --> 19:50.355
I'm so sorry, Isaac.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.441
You need a transplant.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.236
Well, what are my chances
of getting a new lung?

19:56.320 --> 19:58.280
Well, you're a good candidate.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.991
You're young, otherwise healthy.

20:01.074 --> 20:03.410
But in order to be eligible
for a transplant,

20:03.493 --> 20:05.829
all patients must have a support system.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.832
Two people who can take care
of you after the surgery,

20:08.916 --> 20:12.127
take you to appointments,
administer medication

20:12.211 --> 20:14.171
for as long as necessary.

20:14.254 --> 20:16.215
They'll have to commit to your recovery,

20:16.298 --> 20:19.218
which can be a long process.

20:20.802 --> 20:23.805
Yeah, I am the support system
for other people.

20:25.807 --> 20:27.851
I don't have one of my own.

20:27.935 --> 20:31.188
Well, surely there's someone
who can step up, right?

20:31.271 --> 20:34.233
Old foster parents, friends?

20:39.613 --> 20:43.158
It's my own fault.

20:43.242 --> 20:46.453
Growing up, I had
a huge chip on my shoulder.

20:46.536 --> 20:50.666
Anger cost me
every relationship in my life.

20:50.749 --> 20:54.711
I found my companionship in drugs.

20:54.795 --> 20:57.589
I lost my job and then my home.

21:00.175 --> 21:02.594
I've lived my life alone.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.225
Now it sounds like that's how I'll die.

21:11.561 --> 21:13.647
(quietly):
Okay.

21:13.730 --> 21:16.066
Why don't you give us some time,

21:16.149 --> 21:18.652
see if there's something
that we can figure out, okay?

21:19.820 --> 21:21.363
You know, I do have a contact

21:21.446 --> 21:23.365
in the pulmonary fibrosis community.

21:23.448 --> 21:27.244
Maybe they have some resources
that could help Isaac?

21:27.327 --> 21:28.537
(sighs)

21:30.664 --> 21:31.957
Never thought I'd say this,

21:32.040 --> 21:35.294
but silence is not a good look on you.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.213
What's up?

21:40.215 --> 21:43.760
I was thinking about Isaac.

21:43.844 --> 21:46.221
He was abandoned by his parents,

21:46.305 --> 21:50.309
never had a real home
or people who cared about him.

21:50.392 --> 21:55.230
And how he just ended up
living in the streets.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.983
Do you think that could have
been you if you weren't adopted?

21:58.066 --> 22:02.195
Look, I was dealt a good hand.
He was not.

22:02.279 --> 22:05.449
He can't think of
one person that can help him?

22:05.532 --> 22:07.909
I have worked with Isaac for over a year.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.578
He spends all of his time helping those

22:09.661 --> 22:10.829
who aren't equipped to help themselves.

22:10.912 --> 22:13.415
He really doesn't have anyone.

22:13.498 --> 22:16.209
You know, he's not gonna
live long post transplant

22:16.293 --> 22:17.711
without a lot of help.

22:19.963 --> 22:23.216
But come on, who's got the capacity
and the willingness

22:23.300 --> 22:27.512
to take responsibility
of a 20-something-year-old man?

22:29.556 --> 22:31.725
Me.

22:44.780 --> 22:49.368
I wanted to give them a moment
alone before Josie arrives.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.119
Derek's parents are trying to get here,

22:51.203 --> 22:54.122
but I'm not sure they'll make it.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.500
And Molly's dad?
Is he on the way?

22:56.583 --> 22:58.585
Brett's in Denmark for work.

22:58.668 --> 23:00.253
He's trying to get home,

23:00.337 --> 23:03.048
but... we're not together
anymore, it's complicated.

23:03.131 --> 23:05.300
I-- That's none of my business.

23:05.384 --> 23:09.513
And I-- and I can--
I know I have no standing here.

23:09.596 --> 23:12.057
But I... had to do something

23:12.140 --> 23:14.184
for you and your family.

23:14.267 --> 23:16.686
And this is just...
the best I could come up with.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.271
What is it?

23:18.355 --> 23:20.440
I approached
our palliative care people for advice,

23:20.524 --> 23:21.650
and they suggested this.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.819
It's a legacy book.

23:23.902 --> 23:26.947
So, a guide that helps patients

23:27.030 --> 23:31.410
facing a dangerous procedure
with an uncertain outcome.

23:31.493 --> 23:35.288
It helps them organize
their memories and, um,

23:35.372 --> 23:38.708
put their wishes in order.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.002
Just in case the...

23:42.379 --> 23:44.089
And if, and if this is-- if I'm intruding,

23:44.172 --> 23:45.382
if this is the wrong thing,

23:45.465 --> 23:48.093
-I'm...
-It's perfect.

23:48.176 --> 23:51.805
Derek needs to feel like
he has some control.

23:51.888 --> 23:53.807
Thank you.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.989
Sorry.
We got trapped in the ER.

24:09.072 --> 24:10.866
How's Sophia?

24:10.949 --> 24:13.076
She became more acidotic and hypoxic,

24:13.160 --> 24:14.744
so I had to intubate her.

24:14.828 --> 24:17.122
And she's still spiking a fever

24:17.205 --> 24:19.124
despite being on new antibiotics.

24:19.207 --> 24:22.377
Her latest set of labs
show an acute liver injury.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.212
Right.

24:27.924 --> 24:30.844
What if she doesn't have an infection?

24:32.429 --> 24:35.140
You did a detailed patient history.

24:35.223 --> 24:36.766
Tell us more about Sophia.

24:36.850 --> 24:41.771
Well, her mom suffered from lupus
and her dad had MS.

24:41.855 --> 24:44.441
Both are autoimmune disorders.
They could run in families.

24:44.524 --> 24:47.235
Acute liver injury, joint pain,
and Sophia's other symptoms,

24:47.319 --> 24:49.821
she may have adult-onset Still's disease.

24:49.905 --> 24:52.073
DEVON: Ezra, what is the treatment
for adult-onset Still's?

24:52.157 --> 24:54.701
Steroids.
But we can't give her that.

24:54.784 --> 24:57.204
That absolutely can't happen.

24:59.873 --> 25:00.957
Why not?

25:01.041 --> 25:02.918
EZRA: Because-- W-Well,
there's no test to confirm

25:03.001 --> 25:06.463
adult-onset Still's,
so we'd be treating Sophia blind.

25:06.546 --> 25:09.007
That's not ideal,

25:09.090 --> 25:11.843
but if we do nothing,
Sophia could get worse.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.136
I'm gonna check on Sophia.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.514
And then I'll order the steroids.

25:15.597 --> 25:17.891
Uh, uh, aren't-aren't there risks
in giving her steroids?

25:17.974 --> 25:21.144
Yes. Why don't you tell me what they are?

25:21.228 --> 25:22.604
EZRA:
Death.

25:22.687 --> 25:24.898
If you give high-dose steroids
to a patient

25:24.981 --> 25:26.358
with Candida auris,

25:26.441 --> 25:27.984
you'll exacerbate the fungal infection

25:28.068 --> 25:30.987
-and kill her.
-Look, we can't let her die.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.739
Her death won't make sense.

25:32.822 --> 25:34.324
We could trigger an investigation.

25:34.407 --> 25:37.035
We can't let Sophia die
because she's a human being

25:37.118 --> 25:38.537
-and we could prevent it.
-Of course.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.790
Of-of course,
that's the first priority here.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.291
Let me think, we have to fix this.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.043
We've gone too far already.

25:45.126 --> 25:47.796
None of this would be happening
if not for the liver injury,

25:47.879 --> 25:50.465
and that is a known side effect
of the antifungal I gave her.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.968
Okay. I get it.

25:53.051 --> 25:56.388
So what we have to do
is we have to stop Hawkins

25:56.471 --> 25:58.306
-from treating with steroids.
-How do we do that?

25:58.390 --> 26:00.058
I don't know!

26:05.730 --> 26:07.816
-ISAAC: It's not just me?
-CHERYL: No, it's not just you. (laughs)

26:07.899 --> 26:10.902
ISAAC: Oh, that's nice.
Although I'd like to be more of a...

26:10.986 --> 26:13.363
Well, you two seem to be hitting it off.

26:13.446 --> 26:15.115
Well, of course.
I'm charming.

26:15.198 --> 26:18.243
Or she's very easily impressed.
I'm not sure which.

26:18.326 --> 26:20.287
People like you are why I run

26:20.370 --> 26:22.289
a pulmonary fibrosis organization.

26:22.372 --> 26:26.626
We are in contact with
more than two million people.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.045
And I will absolutely put you
in touch with survivors

26:29.129 --> 26:30.463
who can talk to you about what it's like

26:30.547 --> 26:32.549
to live with the disease.

26:32.632 --> 26:34.342
Just know that you're not alone.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.428
I-I love the sound of that.

26:37.679 --> 26:40.974
Well, hopefully
you'll like the sound of this, too.

26:41.057 --> 26:44.811
Conrad and I have agreed
to be your support system.

26:46.354 --> 26:48.398
Wait, you're serious?

26:49.816 --> 26:51.443
And with that assurance,

26:51.526 --> 26:54.487
we got you on the transplant list.

26:59.159 --> 27:02.704
My entire life, I've never had anybody

27:02.787 --> 27:05.206
really stand by me.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.918
I don't even know how to thank you.

27:17.385 --> 27:19.179
Wait, wait!

27:19.262 --> 27:21.348
Are those steroids?

27:21.431 --> 27:22.891
No, it's an antifungal.

27:25.852 --> 27:29.147
Sophia has Candida auris.

27:29.230 --> 27:31.650
Candida auris?
H-How did you go from diagnosing Sophia

27:31.733 --> 27:34.486
with adult-onset Still's to Candida auris?

27:34.569 --> 27:37.697
There is no test to confirm
onset Still's disease...

27:37.781 --> 27:41.368
-but you can rule it out.
-I'm sorry, I'm a...

27:41.451 --> 27:43.745
intern, still learning here.

27:43.828 --> 27:44.913
(chuckles)

27:44.996 --> 27:47.540
-Sophia had a fever. Right?
-Yeah.

27:47.624 --> 27:50.251
The only telltale sign of Still's is...

27:50.335 --> 27:53.380
a salmon-colored rash when a fever spikes.

27:53.463 --> 27:54.547
She didn't have one.

27:57.342 --> 27:58.593
When that happens...

28:00.845 --> 28:03.682
...you go back to the well.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.433
And you dig deep.

28:07.852 --> 28:08.853
Have a look.

28:20.990 --> 28:23.618
Otitis externa.
She has an ear infection.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.246
Which is how Candida auris
was discovered in 2009.

28:26.329 --> 28:28.498
Hence the name-- auris is Latin for ear.

28:28.581 --> 28:29.999
Seemed like a leap, but I ran the cultures

28:30.083 --> 28:31.459
and confirmed it.

28:35.588 --> 28:37.215
(door opens)

28:44.764 --> 28:47.851
Dr. Hawkins knows.

28:47.934 --> 28:50.895
He figured out Sophia has Candida auris.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.731
I heard.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.193
He already notified the health department.

28:58.945 --> 29:00.405
It's over.

29:00.488 --> 29:03.450
Get the bag of antifungals
that you hung and it will be.

29:03.533 --> 29:05.744
It's the only thing
that connects us to this.

29:11.374 --> 29:13.209
There's something I don't understand.

29:14.627 --> 29:17.255
Why cover this up?

29:17.338 --> 29:18.590
You're the most powerful doctor I know.

29:18.673 --> 29:20.175
You could have survived this

29:20.258 --> 29:22.886
if you'd just told the truth
from the beginning.

29:22.969 --> 29:24.554
Why didn't you?

29:24.637 --> 29:27.432
Because Logan Kim would have destroyed me.

29:27.515 --> 29:29.017
Over one mistake?

29:33.688 --> 29:35.940
This isn't the first, Ezra.

29:38.276 --> 29:42.030
When I was an intern, much like you...

29:42.113 --> 29:44.073
something really bad happened.

29:44.157 --> 29:45.533
We all make mistakes in the beginning.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.327
Not like this one.

29:49.370 --> 29:52.874
Laparoscopic instruments
got infected by bacteria.

29:55.168 --> 29:59.631
Patients got sick
just from routine procedures.

30:02.717 --> 30:04.511
Four of them ended up dead.

30:04.594 --> 30:08.556
I suspected that the instruments
were contaminated,

30:08.640 --> 30:11.559
but... I never said anything.

30:11.643 --> 30:14.229
Why?

30:14.312 --> 30:15.855
Fear.

30:20.777 --> 30:23.154
Red Rock covered for me,
but that was all possible

30:23.238 --> 30:26.199
because your mother took pity on me.

30:26.282 --> 30:28.076
She helped them.

30:28.159 --> 30:30.537
And I would not be here
right now without her.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.789
My mom wouldn't have
stuck her neck out like that

30:32.872 --> 30:35.166
if she didn't see something in you.

30:35.250 --> 30:38.211
And with her sacrifice,
I've done a lot of good.

30:38.294 --> 30:42.841
A lot.
And I hope to do more.

30:45.468 --> 30:49.806
But there's just one more loose end...

30:54.769 --> 30:56.563
What else should
we put in our picture book?

30:56.646 --> 30:58.398
JOSIE:
My birthday party.

30:58.481 --> 31:00.525
-Good idea.
-There you are at the steamboat restaurant

31:00.608 --> 31:03.152
with your cake and ice cream.
Hmm?

31:03.236 --> 31:04.946
DEREK:
Mm.

31:05.029 --> 31:09.325
So this one for sure
goes in the legacy book.

31:11.703 --> 31:14.581
'Cause Josie and I, we love our ice cream.

31:14.664 --> 31:16.749
Yeah? (chuckles)

31:16.833 --> 31:18.585
MOLLY:
I'll get a print made.

31:18.668 --> 31:20.587
(exhales)

31:20.670 --> 31:22.755
Here.

31:22.839 --> 31:25.300
Why does Daddy have to wear the mask?

31:25.383 --> 31:26.968
It helps him breathe.

31:27.051 --> 31:30.513
-He's still very sick?
-MOLLY: Yes.

31:30.597 --> 31:32.765
But he's fighting to get better.

31:33.808 --> 31:37.228
Honey?
You and Mommy

31:37.312 --> 31:42.358
are gonna be alone
while I'm in the hospital.

31:42.442 --> 31:46.696
I know this is all confusing and scary.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.616
But will you promise me

31:49.699 --> 31:51.284
you'll take care of each other?

31:53.953 --> 31:57.832
-That's my girl.
-(knock on door)

31:57.916 --> 32:01.669
Thought someone
might want a hot chocolate.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.839
-What do we say?
-Thank you, Dr. Hawkins.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.467
Oh, you're welcome.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.385
What's that for?

32:09.469 --> 32:11.471
Uh, the vent will help your dad breathe.

32:11.554 --> 32:14.140
They're just setting it up for later.

32:14.223 --> 32:17.936
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Code Blue, Room 54-17.

32:18.019 --> 32:21.356
-Code Blue, Room 54-17.
-NURSE: I need a vent, now!

32:21.439 --> 32:23.900
Go. I'll ask for another one.

32:23.983 --> 32:25.985
(alarm sounding)

32:31.783 --> 32:34.911
(gasping)

32:34.994 --> 32:38.831
Isaac.
What's happening, man?

32:38.915 --> 32:42.126
Sats in the 80s.
BP's down to 70/50.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.129
No, wait.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.423
-If we wait, he'll code.
-Well, his neck veins,

32:47.507 --> 32:50.802
they're distended up to his ears.

32:50.885 --> 32:53.763
He's hyperresonant on the left.
There's air in there.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.642
Chest tube is kinked.

32:57.725 --> 33:00.353
What? You got to be kidding me.

33:00.436 --> 33:02.021
That's what's causing the hemothorax.

33:02.105 --> 33:04.065
-(grunts, mutters)
-(Isaac groans)

33:04.148 --> 33:06.025
(gasping)

33:06.109 --> 33:08.778
Oh, yeah, there you go.
Hey, hey, hey, you all right?

33:08.861 --> 33:09.988
-You're breathing now, right?
-Mm-hmm.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.531
All right, all right, Isaac.

33:11.614 --> 33:13.241
We got you.

33:13.324 --> 33:14.867
Listen to me.
Guys like Isaac,

33:14.951 --> 33:16.744
if they go on the vent,
they never come off.

33:16.828 --> 33:19.539
Vents fall into
the "last resort only" category.

33:19.622 --> 33:22.542
-You got me?
-Got it.

33:22.625 --> 33:24.711
All right, all right.
We got you.

33:24.794 --> 33:26.671
You need this?

33:26.754 --> 33:28.214
No, it's okay.
Put it over there.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.806
Well, because your fibrosis is genetic,

33:36.889 --> 33:38.891
I asked Cheryl if she knew of anyone

33:38.975 --> 33:40.476
with premature gray hair in their 20s.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.979
Is she sure that this guy is my cousin,

33:43.062 --> 33:44.856
not just some dude that recovered

33:44.939 --> 33:46.399
from pulmonary fibrosis?

33:46.482 --> 33:48.109
A DNA test will confirm,

33:48.192 --> 33:51.863
but you cannot deny the resemblance.

33:57.118 --> 34:01.080
Those are definitely
my eyes and my nose and my chin.

34:01.164 --> 34:04.167
-And everything.
-(laughter)

34:04.250 --> 34:06.878
His name is Gabriel,
and after hearing your story,

34:06.961 --> 34:09.338
he thinks your mom is his aunt.

34:09.422 --> 34:13.342
She got pregnant as a teen
and ran away from home.

34:13.426 --> 34:18.056
And they've been searching for
her and her child ever since.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.849
Now, he's talked
to the rest of his family,

34:19.932 --> 34:22.935
and they have agreed
to be your support system.

34:23.019 --> 34:24.520
Even if you're not related.

34:24.604 --> 34:28.066
I don't even know how to thank you.

34:29.358 --> 34:33.071
You've been longing
for this your whole life.

34:33.154 --> 34:35.490
And now it's here.

34:46.125 --> 34:47.835
He's ready.

34:49.879 --> 34:51.672
As ready as he'll ever be.

34:52.715 --> 34:54.509
I helped him write a beautiful letter

34:54.592 --> 34:57.887
for the legacy book
that Josie will have all her life.

34:57.970 --> 34:59.806
Let's hope she never has to read it.

34:59.889 --> 35:01.432
Yeah.

35:01.516 --> 35:06.229
The legacy book was a great idea, Mom,

35:06.312 --> 35:10.316
and made Derek feel like...
like no matter what,

35:10.399 --> 35:12.860
he was still taking care of me and Josie.

35:12.944 --> 35:16.572
Oh, darling, it's okay.

35:16.656 --> 35:17.907
Let it go.

35:17.990 --> 35:20.243
Okay.

35:20.326 --> 35:22.370
Remember this.

35:22.453 --> 35:25.123
Derek can still make it through,
and no one

35:25.206 --> 35:27.291
is giving up on him.

35:29.961 --> 35:32.046
-Come here.
-(laughs softly)

35:36.759 --> 35:39.137
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

35:39.220 --> 35:41.180
(crying)

35:49.730 --> 35:51.732
It's gonna be okay.

35:54.068 --> 35:55.361
Okay.

35:55.444 --> 35:58.531
It's time for Dr. Bell
to take you to get some food.

35:58.614 --> 35:59.866
I don't want to leave Daddy.

35:59.949 --> 36:01.742
KIT:
Daddy wants you to go with Dr. Bell.

36:01.826 --> 36:03.786
He's very nice.

36:03.870 --> 36:05.538
Sometimes even a little bit funny.

36:12.420 --> 36:13.337
I love you.

36:13.421 --> 36:15.423
I love you, too, Daddy.

36:33.274 --> 36:34.817
We'll be here when you wake up.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.780
KIT:
They'll be fine.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.282
I'll make sure of it.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.872
I know.

36:47.955 --> 36:49.665
I love you, too.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.506
It's okay.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.180
-You good?
-I'm good.

37:04.263 --> 37:06.974
All right.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.601
We're gonna give you a medication

37:08.684 --> 37:10.144
that will put you to sleep.

37:31.624 --> 37:33.626
All right, Kathleen.

37:33.709 --> 37:36.045
There you go.

37:41.259 --> 37:44.262
(crying)

38:11.330 --> 38:12.873
(indistinct chatter nearby)

38:40.276 --> 38:41.569
What happened to her?

38:41.652 --> 38:44.196
Antifungals aren't working.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.157
We've got her on four liters
of normal saline.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.616
Her systolic is still in the 70s.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.410
She's going into shock.
She needs pressors.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.203
There's no access.
Her veins are collapsed.

38:51.287 --> 38:53.205
Then let's get an IO.

38:53.289 --> 38:55.291
Ezra, grab one out of the code cart.

39:10.431 --> 39:12.183
Where's that drill going?

39:12.266 --> 39:13.184
Directly into the bone marrow.

39:13.267 --> 39:14.810
(whirring)

39:20.399 --> 39:21.984
Now you have your central access.

39:23.778 --> 39:26.322
Okay, starting her on norepi.

39:29.408 --> 39:32.119
Turn it up to 50 mics per kilo.

39:33.454 --> 39:36.290
(beeping rapidly)

39:36.374 --> 39:37.500
Higher.

39:38.542 --> 39:41.003
-She's maxed out.
-So what do we do?

39:41.087 --> 39:42.880
Hit her with every antifungal
in our pharmacy.

39:42.963 --> 39:44.340
And if none of them work?

39:44.423 --> 39:45.549
Then she dies.

40:03.526 --> 40:06.695
DEVON: I mean, how did Sophia even get
Candida auris to begin with?

40:06.779 --> 40:10.241
The health department
will have to find the source.

40:10.324 --> 40:11.742
If we would have found it sooner,

40:11.826 --> 40:13.786
maybe that would have made the difference.

40:15.371 --> 40:19.125
Hey, it's not your fault.

40:19.208 --> 40:23.129
Candida auris is notoriously
difficult to diagnose.

40:25.381 --> 40:27.925
EZRA:
She got antifungals from the start.

40:28.008 --> 40:30.469
Long before you knew.

40:30.553 --> 40:33.305
What are you talking about?

40:34.348 --> 40:36.058
I gave them to her.

40:36.142 --> 40:39.645
-What? Why would you do that?
-Dr. Cain told me to.

40:41.981 --> 40:43.315
Why?

40:43.399 --> 40:46.235
He knew she had Candida auris?

40:47.278 --> 40:48.404
He suspected.

40:48.487 --> 40:50.906
How?

40:52.032 --> 40:55.494
It's been killing me
keeping Cain's secrets.

40:55.578 --> 40:59.373
You better sit down and tell us
the whole story right now.

41:14.180 --> 41:18.225
I assume you heard the EMT
who brought Dawn Long here is dead.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.811
Sophia.

41:24.231 --> 41:25.608
Say something.

41:25.691 --> 41:27.026
What do you want me to say?

41:27.109 --> 41:29.361
That you regret going to Logan

41:29.445 --> 41:31.155
instead of the state health board.

41:31.238 --> 41:33.991
That you wish you would have
come to me from the beginning,

41:34.074 --> 41:36.243
'cause maybe we could've done
something to save her.

41:36.327 --> 41:41.207
That you regret
using a scared, vulnerable kid,

41:41.290 --> 41:42.708
saddling him with guilt he'll carry

41:42.791 --> 41:43.918
with him the rest of his life.

41:44.001 --> 41:46.921
Spare me your self-righteous anger.

41:47.004 --> 41:49.340
You're no angel.

41:49.423 --> 41:50.883
You've caused harm.
You've made mistakes.

41:50.966 --> 41:53.677
I don't willfully endanger my patients.

41:53.761 --> 41:55.513
I told Kim and I warned him

41:55.596 --> 41:57.431
to be straightforward about Candida auris.

41:57.515 --> 42:00.059
I told him about that.

42:00.142 --> 42:03.729
-He threatened me.
-But you-- you caved?

42:03.812 --> 42:06.607
All that bluster, you bow down to a suit?

42:06.690 --> 42:08.442
Why do you come in here?

42:08.526 --> 42:09.985
So you can feel like a king?

42:10.069 --> 42:12.488
Convince yourself you're not a coward?

42:14.615 --> 42:16.951
Get out.

42:17.034 --> 42:19.620
How could someone
so brilliant and so gifted

42:19.703 --> 42:22.748
throw it all away
and sell their soul to Red Rock?

42:22.831 --> 42:26.377
Is it just the money? The power?

42:26.460 --> 42:29.380
Your name on a building?

42:29.463 --> 42:31.382
What does any of that mean
at the end of the day

42:31.465 --> 42:33.467
if you can't look in the mirror?

42:36.679 --> 42:38.681
(door opens)

42:52.861 --> 42:55.864
Come on. It's okay.

43:09.545 --> 43:11.547
Sleep tight, Daddy.

43:54.923 --> 43:56.884
