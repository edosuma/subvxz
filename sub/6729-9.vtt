01:37.025 --> 01:38.567
Jessica.

01:43.526 --> 01:44.734
Jessica.

01:53.651 --> 01:55.025
Jessica!

01:55.109 --> 01:56.692
Smile, Kevin.

01:59.401 --> 02:02.692
<i>Be a big boy for Mummy and Daddy, Kevin.</i>

02:10.025 --> 02:12.526
<i>You don't see Eric crying
when he goes in the sin bin.</i>

02:12.609 --> 02:14.067
You lied to me!

02:23.818 --> 02:27.275
...built up my trust,
pretended we were a team?

02:29.359 --> 02:31.234
You even made me a hero.

02:32.234 --> 02:34.484
All this while you were planning this?
Why?

02:35.067 --> 02:36.484
Because you're not a hero.

02:37.401 --> 02:39.609
You're a murderer, Kevin.

02:39.692 --> 02:40.859
Shut up!

02:40.942 --> 02:42.609
Go ahead, command me again.

02:43.275 --> 02:46.401
That's a hermetically sealed room...
Kevin.

02:46.484 --> 02:48.484
Kevin died in that lab.

02:48.567 --> 02:52.442
Granted, it is a mundane name,
but "Kilgrave"?

02:52.526 --> 02:54.484
Talk about obvious.

02:54.567 --> 02:57.234
Was "Murdercorpse" already taken?

02:58.401 --> 03:00.484
You have feelings for me, Jessica.

03:00.567 --> 03:01.818
If you didn't, I'd be dead.

03:01.900 --> 03:03.567
There are worse things than death.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.067
Don't be melodramatic.

03:05.150 --> 03:08.609
Like being the slave
to a sociopathic killer.

03:08.692 --> 03:10.401
I've never killed anyone.

03:11.442 --> 03:13.109
Can you say the same?

03:20.942 --> 03:24.067
If you wanna build trust,
start by admitting what you did.

03:25.526 --> 03:28.442
To me, to Hope, to Ruben...

03:30.067 --> 03:32.067
I thought P.I.'s were
supposed to be clever.

03:33.275 --> 03:35.234
Start at the beginning, Kevin.

03:36.025 --> 03:37.275
Um...

03:41.484 --> 03:44.109
It was a cold, clear night...

03:46.359 --> 03:51.776
when I came across a young beauty being
savagely attacked down a dark alley.

03:51.859 --> 03:53.359
Don't make me hurt you.

03:53.442 --> 03:55.067
I saved you...

03:56.275 --> 03:57.859
dried your tears,

03:57.983 --> 03:59.526
fed you dinner.

04:02.234 --> 04:05.317
And later we made sweet, sweet love.

04:05.983 --> 04:07.317
Ahh!

04:10.859 --> 04:12.067
Forgot to mention...

04:13.150 --> 04:15.942
the water in your room
is a conductor to an open wire.

04:17.233 --> 04:20.192
It was jerry-rigged
by a former Spec Ops interrogator.

04:20.274 --> 04:22.150
Clearly, he knows his shit.

04:24.401 --> 04:26.484
I'm impressed.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.776
I never realized you were such a bitch.

04:28.859 --> 04:32.567
Yeah, well, this bitch is
in control of you now, asshole.

04:38.484 --> 04:39.818
Simpson! God...

04:39.859 --> 04:41.067
Simpson, can you hear me?

04:41.150 --> 04:44.859
Simpson! The plan was to capture him,
not kill him.

04:44.983 --> 04:46.567
Where's Jessica?

04:46.651 --> 04:48.025
Kozlov...

04:48.109 --> 04:49.983
I know, you'll only see Dr. Kozlov,

04:50.067 --> 04:52.567
but I called Metro-General,
and he's not on staff.

04:56.234 --> 04:59.484
- He'll be there.
- You might bleed out first.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.734
- Did the police see you?
- No, I made sure.

05:01.818 --> 05:04.359
You weren't there.
I wasn't there.

05:04.442 --> 05:07.484
- Was Jessica there?
- The neighbor's dead.

05:07.567 --> 05:10.317
And my boys... God!

05:10.401 --> 05:12.567
My boys are dead!

05:12.651 --> 05:15.234
Simpson, I will kill you
if you die in my car.

05:15.317 --> 05:16.818
Kozlov... Metro...

05:25.192 --> 05:27.275
- What happened to him?
- There was an explosion.

05:27.359 --> 05:29.567
He wants to see a Dr. Kozlov,
says he works here.

05:29.651 --> 05:32.859
Never heard of him.
We need to start an IV. Let's go, people.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.818
So you weren't the only lab rat.

06:18.942 --> 06:22.359
Reva knew about this, didn't she?
And that's why you wanted her dead.

06:23.734 --> 06:25.150
I never touched that woman.

06:26.359 --> 06:27.900
Where are these other kids?

06:28.983 --> 06:30.192
You killed for this video,

06:30.275 --> 06:33.359
and you never thought
to look for the other kids?

06:34.401 --> 06:35.651
Afraid of the competition?

06:35.734 --> 06:36.942
You're a better sleuth than that.

06:37.025 --> 06:38.192
They were all in different labs.

06:38.275 --> 06:41.818
I was too busy looking
for my own sadistic parents

06:41.859 --> 06:44.275
to care about strange children.

06:44.359 --> 06:45.692
Maybe you killed them all.

06:46.359 --> 06:48.651
Help me!
I'm being held captive by a mad...

06:51.818 --> 06:53.150
What the hell are you doing?

06:53.234 --> 06:55.317
- Please don't let her...
- Stop! Now!

06:55.942 --> 06:57.234
Oh, God bless...

06:57.317 --> 06:58.692
God bless you.

06:58.776 --> 07:00.401
Oh, God bless you.

07:01.401 --> 07:03.900
- This was your plan?
- My plan was to cut his balls off,

07:03.983 --> 07:05.734
but now I'll settle for a confession.

07:05.818 --> 07:08.692
Under duress.
It'll be inadmissible.

07:08.776 --> 07:09.776
Worse, it'll indict you.

07:09.859 --> 07:11.900
Let him go and hope
that he doesn't press charges.

07:11.983 --> 07:14.567
The second you share
the same air with him,

07:14.651 --> 07:16.776
he will make you
put your head through a window.

07:16.859 --> 07:18.818
You've heard from those survivors.

07:18.859 --> 07:21.484
That's all you have, hearsay.
Where's the proof?

07:21.567 --> 07:23.818
I have video. His parents...

07:23.859 --> 07:27.025
Were evil scientists, yes.
I listened to the files you sent.

07:27.109 --> 07:28.859
But there's nothing to link
the boy in that video

07:28.942 --> 07:30.067
to the man you are torturing.

07:30.150 --> 07:33.109
Then I will make a new video
and force him to use his abilities.

07:33.192 --> 07:34.942
There is no time.

07:35.859 --> 07:39.776
- Since when?
- The DA is offering Hope a plea bargain.

07:39.859 --> 07:41.651
What?

07:41.734 --> 07:43.109
Why now?

07:43.192 --> 07:45.859
All the stories, all the crazy claims
coming out of the woodwork

07:45.942 --> 07:48.150
make for bad press.
They want it done.

07:48.234 --> 07:51.150
No, I am too close.
I have him.

07:51.776 --> 07:55.109
Hope will do 20 years,
maybe 15 for good behavior.

07:56.275 --> 07:59.484
If she turns it down,
she could do life.

07:59.567 --> 08:02.776
I have a legal obligation
to present this plea deal to my client.

08:02.859 --> 08:06.317
- So you haven't told her yet?
- I wanted to see what you had.

08:09.526 --> 08:10.692
One juror, right?

08:10.776 --> 08:14.859
That's all we need, is one juror
to believe in Kilgrave's mind control.

08:14.983 --> 08:16.692
- That's reasonable doubt.
- Technically.

08:16.776 --> 08:18.942
But any video would be...

08:19.025 --> 08:21.025
would be dismissed as staged.

08:21.109 --> 08:22.401
Shit.

08:22.484 --> 08:24.651
- What, is that the DA?
- No!

08:24.734 --> 08:27.651
No. You know what, Jessica?
I have problems of my own.

08:27.734 --> 08:31.359
I have a life.
I have a fiancÃ©e, a vindictive ex...

08:33.484 --> 08:38.025
Hogarth, tell me how
to legitimize the video.

08:38.109 --> 08:40.734
You need a witness with legal authority.

08:40.859 --> 08:42.982
What, like a cop, or a judge?

08:43.067 --> 08:44.109
Either.

08:44.192 --> 08:47.401
But the DA is giving us a 48-hour
window for this plea deal.

08:48.818 --> 08:51.192
I'll have a cop here in three.

08:51.275 --> 08:54.275
Will you just... wait here?

08:54.359 --> 08:58.567
You are in no position
to ask me to do anything.

08:58.651 --> 09:01.734
You have done
absolutely nothing to help me.

09:03.942 --> 09:06.401
Kilgrave's seen you, Hogarth.

09:06.484 --> 09:08.275
You're already implicated.

09:09.192 --> 09:10.734
You set me up.

09:11.359 --> 09:13.651
You need to see this through with me.

09:13.734 --> 09:14.942
God damn it.

09:15.025 --> 09:17.900
Don't look at him, don't talk to him,
and don't listen to him.

09:17.983 --> 09:19.192
Or he'll mind control me.

09:19.275 --> 09:21.526
No, because he's an asshole.

09:21.651 --> 09:24.983
His powers don't work through a mic,
so you'd have to go in the room.

09:25.067 --> 09:26.401
Don't do that, either.

09:34.484 --> 09:36.484
Shoot.

09:37.067 --> 09:38.359
Uh-huh. Here you go.

09:39.442 --> 09:40.983
You're making a mistake.

09:41.067 --> 09:43.734
The cart on 41st Street
has pastrami fries.

09:45.942 --> 09:47.317
I need you to witness something.

09:47.401 --> 09:48.942
I don't like what I see
when you're around.

09:49.025 --> 09:52.150
Oh, you mean that room full of cops
that put their own Glocks to their heads?

09:52.234 --> 09:53.651
I don't know what that was about.

09:53.734 --> 09:56.317
I do.
And I know the man responsible.

09:56.401 --> 09:57.609
You know Lieutenant Evans, huh?

09:57.692 --> 10:00.776
They say he orchestrated that whole prank.
Quite a character, Evans.

10:00.859 --> 10:03.067
Was it a prank when I twisted
that chair in half?

10:03.150 --> 10:05.025
Or dumped a human head on your desk?

10:05.109 --> 10:07.776
Evans may have bad taste,
but we all decided to look the other way.

10:07.859 --> 10:08.859
It's better for everybody.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.192
You can't ignore what you saw.

10:11.025 --> 10:13.776
What I saw at that station
was a group of brave cops

10:13.859 --> 10:15.859
who could all be kicked off the force
as suicide risks

10:15.942 --> 10:16.942
if any of this should get out.

10:17.025 --> 10:19.818
You have a chance
of bringing in a serial killer.

10:19.859 --> 10:22.609
And I'm two years away
from a full pension.

10:22.692 --> 10:24.942
Thank you and goodbye, Miss Jones.

10:26.442 --> 10:29.109
696 Hackett Street, Apartment C.

10:30.109 --> 10:31.651
If you don't think Kilgrave's a threat,

10:31.734 --> 10:33.567
you won't mind if I give him
your home address.

10:33.651 --> 10:35.983
- You wouldn't do that.
- Of course not.

10:36.067 --> 10:38.025
Because I know that Kilgrave is dangerous,

10:38.109 --> 10:40.025
and so do you,
or you would've kept walking.

10:40.983 --> 10:44.150
I can get him off the streets,
but I need your help.

10:46.776 --> 10:49.401
Googling my address
does not make you a detective.

10:49.484 --> 10:51.942
Good detectives use evidence.

10:52.025 --> 10:53.317
Like security footage.

10:53.401 --> 10:56.025
But the cameras at the station
were all wiped clean.

10:56.109 --> 11:00.150
So unless you have positive proof
that a crime was committed...

11:03.484 --> 11:05.275
Yeah, I didn't think so.

11:29.818 --> 11:35.150
Wendy, if I get disbarred,
you will get 90% of nothing.

11:35.776 --> 11:37.567
<i>Yesterday, it was 75%.</i>

11:37.651 --> 11:40.025
And if it was 100%,
you'd still be getting off easy.

11:40.818 --> 11:42.859
Since when do you care so much
about money?

11:42.942 --> 11:45.234
<i>Since you started spending</i>
all of ours on your secretary.

11:45.317 --> 11:47.401
Oh, I didn't.
I didn't touch a penny of your money.

11:49.567 --> 11:51.651
What are you calling mine?

11:51.734 --> 11:53.484
I turned down field work for you,

11:53.567 --> 11:57.442
I pulled doubles every day
to pay for law school. I don't...

11:57.526 --> 11:59.234
<i>- You got your money's worth.</i>
- What?

11:59.317 --> 12:02.192
I foot the bill
while you played Mother Teresa.

12:02.275 --> 12:07.692
- Now you resent me for helping poor people.
- That's... a new low.

12:07.776 --> 12:11.442
Wendy, even if you take all of my money,

12:11.526 --> 12:13.859
it will not change how I feel about Pam.

12:16.150 --> 12:19.192
No... but it'll hurt.

12:20.526 --> 12:23.401
I won't be the only one
left bleeding on the floor.

12:24.025 --> 12:26.067
And you call me the heartless one.

12:26.150 --> 12:28.401
<i>Wendy, I'm sorry, I take that back.</i>

12:28.484 --> 12:30.317
<i>I know we can agree on a number...</i>

12:31.275 --> 12:32.526
Wendy?

12:58.150 --> 12:59.234
Do you need something?

12:59.317 --> 13:01.484
A good lawyer.
Do you know one?

13:02.234 --> 13:03.983
I'll get you a referral.

13:04.067 --> 13:05.818
Bitches, right?

13:07.609 --> 13:09.109
Trouble with your ex?

13:10.609 --> 13:13.651
Wendy... is it?
Sorry, I was reading your lips.

13:13.734 --> 13:15.234
Could be Randy, but I think not.

13:16.526 --> 13:18.651
Threatening to expose you?
Sounds hideous.

13:18.734 --> 13:20.567
Jessica tell you that?

13:20.651 --> 13:23.359
Hardly.
Jessica doesn't let anyone in.

13:23.442 --> 13:27.192
I bet she hasn't told you
that she moved in with me three days ago.

13:28.150 --> 13:29.526
Hmm?

13:29.609 --> 13:31.025
Cohabitation.

13:32.025 --> 13:33.150
Under her own free will.

13:33.734 --> 13:36.484
It was going great,
then she just snapped.

13:42.234 --> 13:43.983
Jessica has lied to both of us.

13:44.067 --> 13:46.942
What do you really know about her, really?

13:48.442 --> 13:49.942
More than I know about you.

13:50.025 --> 13:53.275
You know her version of events.
No one's even heard mine.

13:53.359 --> 13:57.567
As a lawyer, you must know that
the reality lies somewhere in the middle.

14:03.484 --> 14:07.234
You are clearly a smart woman.

14:07.317 --> 14:10.150
You know that if I did have...

14:12.442 --> 14:15.275
"abilities," they wouldn't be
inherently bad.

14:17.609 --> 14:20.609
Just imagine
what someone like that could do.

14:20.692 --> 14:24.692
His powers of persuasion
could right any wrong.

14:27.942 --> 14:30.150
Make any stubborn problem...

14:31.776 --> 14:33.109
disappear.

14:57.025 --> 14:58.859
Please repeat that for the camera.

15:15.609 --> 15:18.942
Dr. Kozlov only has privileges here.
I left messages for him.

15:19.025 --> 15:20.900
He'll come.

15:20.983 --> 15:23.275
Why don't you just let
one of the other doctors look at you?

15:23.359 --> 15:24.442
The room...

15:25.526 --> 15:27.275
The sealed room I set up...

15:28.526 --> 15:30.442
It's the only place
she could hold Kilgrave.

15:30.526 --> 15:32.942
Just forget about Kilgrave.
You need to focus on...

15:33.025 --> 15:35.150
No, she won't kill him.

15:36.567 --> 15:38.150
It has to be you.

15:39.401 --> 15:40.609
The gun that I gave you...

15:41.651 --> 15:43.317
You can't ask me to do that.

15:44.734 --> 15:46.609
It's the only way.

15:47.692 --> 15:48.776
Let it go.

15:49.692 --> 15:52.776
He's too dangerous.
Look at what he's done to you...

15:52.859 --> 15:56.359
- what he's done to your friends.
- Yeah, which is why you have to kill him.

15:56.442 --> 15:58.192
Just stop, okay?

16:00.983 --> 16:03.567
- Knew you'd come.
- Dr. Kozlov, I'm Trish Walker,

16:03.651 --> 16:05.859
- I brought Sergeant Simpson here.
- "Sergeant"?

16:06.818 --> 16:09.234
I didn't expect to hear from you again.

16:09.317 --> 16:11.776
But I can see why you called.

16:11.859 --> 16:14.109
I want back in.

16:17.609 --> 16:19.317
Team ready?

16:19.401 --> 16:20.567
You need to leave.

16:21.526 --> 16:23.567
- I'll stay until you...
- Now!

16:24.818 --> 16:26.859
- I'm not leaving him.
- Trish, go.

16:28.275 --> 16:29.692
You have to end it.

16:49.567 --> 16:50.942
Finally!

16:51.025 --> 16:52.442
Finally.

16:52.526 --> 16:55.776
What's wrong? Did he do something?
Say something?

16:55.859 --> 16:57.067
Nothing that I listened to.

16:57.983 --> 17:00.692
Visiting hours at the prison are over.
I needed to talk to Hope.

17:00.734 --> 17:02.859
- Sorry.
- No, you're not.

17:02.983 --> 17:06.108
- Where's your cop?
- He needs evidence of Kilgrave's power.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.150
I'd appreciate you manning
the shock switch.

17:08.233 --> 17:11.275
- What, you're going in there?
- Yeah, I know how to piss him off.

17:11.358 --> 17:12.401
When he takes control,

17:12.483 --> 17:15.442
the electricity will stop me
as quickly as Kilgrave.

17:15.526 --> 17:17.818
But only hit the switch
if he makes me hurt myself.

17:17.858 --> 17:19.067
What if he kills you?

17:19.150 --> 17:21.067
Well, then we'll have proof,
won't we?

17:21.150 --> 17:22.483
Wait...

17:23.192 --> 17:26.108
For the record, you are?

17:27.983 --> 17:31.442
I, Jessica Jones,
of sound mind and body,

17:31.526 --> 17:34.150
submit the following footage
into evidence.

18:21.609 --> 18:24.651
My feet are pruning.
What's that?

18:24.734 --> 18:25.859
Food.

18:28.609 --> 18:30.109
Smells fast.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.526
You're welcome.

18:38.401 --> 18:40.359
Are you not afraid that I'll touch you?

18:40.442 --> 18:41.484
No.

18:42.484 --> 18:43.900
Afraid I'll touch you?

18:46.150 --> 18:48.359
I remember how you like to be touched.

18:52.317 --> 18:56.150
It's bad enough to shock me.
You have to toy with my emotions?

18:58.818 --> 19:00.567
You can have it...

19:02.567 --> 19:04.776
but I want you to beg for it.

19:07.859 --> 19:10.359
You will not...

19:12.818 --> 19:14.651
If that was foreplay, I'm all in.

19:14.734 --> 19:16.484
Then do something about it.

19:19.942 --> 19:22.234
Unless you can't compel yourself
to get it up.

19:24.734 --> 19:27.734
After that performance,
you have my full attention.

19:27.818 --> 19:30.192
Oh, you mean that Slim Jim in your pants?

19:31.983 --> 19:33.192
You're pathetic.

19:33.734 --> 19:35.192
You disgust me.

19:36.484 --> 19:39.025
All that power
and you're too afraid to use it.

19:40.526 --> 19:43.067
Scared like a little mama's boy.

19:43.150 --> 19:44.484
Come on, Kevin.

19:44.567 --> 19:47.776
Be a big boy for Mummy and Daddy.

19:52.818 --> 19:55.484
I don't know what you mean.
You have all the power here.

19:57.734 --> 19:59.025
Jesus!

19:59.776 --> 20:02.567
- Make me stop.
- I won't hit a woman.

20:02.651 --> 20:05.109
No, but you'd rape her.

20:05.192 --> 20:08.900
Destroy her mind,
make her a murderer.

20:08.983 --> 20:11.317
- Say the words!
- Jessica, enough.

20:11.401 --> 20:12.734
I loved you.
I gave you whatever you wanted.

20:12.818 --> 20:14.983
All you ever gave me was shame.

20:18.234 --> 20:19.484
And remorse.

20:24.275 --> 20:25.609
And pain.

20:27.150 --> 20:29.401
Stop. I'm gonna hit the switch.

20:30.734 --> 20:32.776
She is going to kill him.

20:34.317 --> 20:36.942
No, she won't.
She's holding back.

20:37.025 --> 20:39.067
Come on, you cowardly piece of shit!

20:40.567 --> 20:42.776
You don't have the balls to fight me?

20:45.776 --> 20:47.734
This isn't you, Jess.
We were happy.

20:47.818 --> 20:50.192
Whatever you think I did to hurt you,
I'm sorry.

20:54.484 --> 20:57.734
What's the matter with you people?
You're just gonna let this happen?

20:57.818 --> 20:59.942
He is powerless.

21:00.025 --> 21:01.484
He's playing us.

21:02.651 --> 21:05.442
I will not be party to any of this.

21:07.317 --> 21:09.109
Please! Somebody help me!

21:18.983 --> 21:20.150
Feels good, doesn't it?

21:22.192 --> 21:23.192
Being in control.

22:00.484 --> 22:02.818
He didn't have to tell me
to do a goddamn thing

22:02.859 --> 22:04.275
and he had all the control.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.442
Got to admire his commitment.

22:11.526 --> 22:12.734
Look at that.

22:14.359 --> 22:16.192
Even I feel sorry for him.

22:16.275 --> 22:17.942
I just helped his case.

22:19.150 --> 22:20.442
I'm such an idiot.

22:37.734 --> 22:40.526
What if you and I walked out
of here right now?

22:41.526 --> 22:44.109
Locked the door and never came back?

22:44.192 --> 22:45.359
Just left him.

22:47.109 --> 22:51.192
Hope could take the deal,
I have enough money to get us far away.

22:51.275 --> 22:52.359
- Trish...
- I mean it.

22:52.442 --> 22:55.734
As long as he has your attention,
as long as you care...

22:55.818 --> 22:57.150
he's in control.

23:02.025 --> 23:04.734
I won't let Hope
lose 20 years of her life.

23:06.442 --> 23:08.275
Why is she your responsibility?

23:09.609 --> 23:11.359
That's not you.

23:11.442 --> 23:12.859
That's your boyfriend.

23:12.942 --> 23:14.359
He's not my boyfriend.

23:15.983 --> 23:17.692
But can you blame him?

23:18.609 --> 23:21.651
Kilgrave murdered Simpson's buddies.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.317
He almost died.

23:23.401 --> 23:25.150
- Wait, what?
- There was a bomb.

23:25.859 --> 23:27.275
An explosion.

23:28.275 --> 23:30.401
Simpson's in the hospital.

23:32.942 --> 23:36.484
<i>Be a big boy for Mummy and Daddy.</i>

23:40.442 --> 23:43.275
He'll be all right.
He's too stubborn to die.

23:45.484 --> 23:47.275
There'll be an investigation.

23:48.192 --> 23:51.609
Maybe a link to prove Kilgrave's guilt.

23:52.942 --> 23:56.234
He doesn't leave fingerprints, ever.

23:56.317 --> 23:59.609
He spent his whole life avoiding cameras,
except that one.

24:02.150 --> 24:04.150
And I thought my mother was bad.

24:06.401 --> 24:08.359
Who does that to their own child?

24:09.484 --> 24:12.609
No one gets under a person's skin
like their parents.

24:15.359 --> 24:17.317
That could push him to the breaking point.

24:18.609 --> 24:19.818
If they're still alive.

24:19.900 --> 24:22.567
He thinks so.
He looked for them for a long time.

24:24.150 --> 24:25.609
Should've hired a P.I.

24:41.776 --> 24:45.609
Wendy sent her evidence
to the general company inbox.

24:45.692 --> 24:48.651
Interns check that.
What if I didn't catch it in time?

24:48.734 --> 24:51.859
It's a bluff.
Just a shot across the bow.

24:51.983 --> 24:56.567
If anyone saw it, you'd be disbarred.
Maybe even put in jail.

24:56.651 --> 24:59.734
- Don't worry about me.
- How about you worry about me?

24:59.818 --> 25:01.942
You committed a crime, Jeri.

25:02.025 --> 25:04.359
And that makes me
an accessory after the fact...

25:04.442 --> 25:06.234
I am doing...

25:06.317 --> 25:08.025
the best I can.

25:08.109 --> 25:09.442
What do you want from me?

25:09.526 --> 25:11.442
I want you to handle it.

25:11.526 --> 25:12.818
If this were any other case,

25:12.900 --> 25:15.859
you would've shut down Wendy
without even breaking a sweat.

25:15.942 --> 25:17.192
This is not a case.

25:18.317 --> 25:20.234
This is my life.

25:20.275 --> 25:25.442
Which includes you being
the best goddamn lawyer in the city.

25:34.275 --> 25:36.651
First time I watched you in court...

25:38.818 --> 25:40.942
I could feel your power.

25:47.900 --> 25:50.983
The way you dismantled
the ADA's argument...

25:52.692 --> 25:55.275
held that jury in your hand.

25:55.359 --> 25:57.275
I could feel you watching me.

25:58.317 --> 26:00.025
You were showing off.

26:00.109 --> 26:02.401
It worked.

26:02.442 --> 26:04.526
- No one controls you.
- No.

26:05.692 --> 26:07.859
No one can stop you.

26:07.942 --> 26:10.401
That is the Jeri I fell in love with.

26:11.983 --> 26:15.359
The one who knows what she wants
and takes it.

26:19.442 --> 26:21.859
If that Jeri comes back,

26:21.983 --> 26:24.526
I'm in.
All the way.

26:25.567 --> 26:27.150
Until then...

26:34.692 --> 26:36.900
I don't like ultimatums.

26:37.776 --> 26:39.317
I know.

27:03.109 --> 27:05.025
The camera never sees their faces.

27:06.317 --> 27:08.942
Look for background details.
We need a location.

27:51.859 --> 27:54.275
What's that right there?
Zoom in on that.

28:34.942 --> 28:37.983
You don't see Eric crying
when he goes in the sin bin.

28:55.192 --> 28:58.609
<i>Be a big boy
for Mummy and Daddy, Kevin.</i>

28:58.692 --> 29:01.234
<i>You don't see Eric crying
when he goes in the sin bin.</i>

29:01.317 --> 29:04.234
Who is Eric?
His brother?

29:05.234 --> 29:07.109
Another kid from the study?

29:10.983 --> 29:12.609
Sin bin.

29:14.734 --> 29:15.818
Rugby?

29:19.150 --> 29:21.734
Baby Kilgrave had a childhood hero.

29:24.609 --> 29:26.651
Eric Brantford.

29:26.734 --> 29:29.692
Rugby Club, University of Manchester.

29:40.401 --> 29:42.484
I'm looking for a Professor Davies.

29:42.567 --> 29:46.859
He was the head of Manchester's
neuroscience department in 1985.

29:46.942 --> 29:48.942
<i>That would be me.</i>

29:49.025 --> 29:50.734
I'm checking a reference.

29:50.818 --> 29:53.734
I need the names of the professors
that ran studies back then.

29:53.818 --> 29:56.942
<i>You're hiring a Spartan?</i>
Then I'm sure they're a good egg.

29:57.025 --> 29:59.567
<i>Not like those sods at Liverpool.</i>
They'll pick your pocket...

29:59.651 --> 30:03.234
The study I'm looking for
had to do with kids.

30:03.317 --> 30:05.192
Experiments on them.

30:05.275 --> 30:07.192
<i>Who is this?</i>

30:07.275 --> 30:10.317
I just need the names of the professors.

30:10.401 --> 30:12.942
<i>They're gone</i>
and they should stay gone.

30:13.025 --> 30:15.484
<i>They skipped town in '88</i>
with some grant money.

30:15.567 --> 30:18.067
<i>The program was aborted</i>
and I was in no way associated with them.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.526
With who?

30:20.484 --> 30:22.192
Please.

30:23.859 --> 30:27.692
<i>Albert and Louise Thompson.</i>
Don't call again.

30:33.442 --> 30:35.859
They want me to plead guilty?

30:35.942 --> 30:37.859
Even if you serve 20 years,

30:37.942 --> 30:41.234
you'll still have half your life
to live on the outside.

30:42.317 --> 30:44.942
After all of this,
you're telling me to lie?

30:46.942 --> 30:49.150
The DA wants an answer by the morning.

30:50.275 --> 30:51.776
I wanna talk to Jessica.

30:52.983 --> 30:54.983
It's your life, not hers.

30:55.067 --> 30:57.109
- You don't...
- You barely know her.

30:59.692 --> 31:03.150
You have a way out
of an impossible situation.

31:03.234 --> 31:06.651
You're too young to know how rare that is,
so take my word for it.

31:08.192 --> 31:10.818
The real world is not about happy endings.

31:10.859 --> 31:15.776
It's about taking the life you have,
and fighting like hell to keep it.

31:23.609 --> 31:25.567
I wanna talk to Jessica.

31:57.651 --> 31:59.359
Still think she looks familiar?

32:03.234 --> 32:04.942
It's impossible, right?

32:06.150 --> 32:08.859
I've stopped using that word around you.

32:13.109 --> 32:15.192
<i>Collect call from
North Eastern Correctional Facility.</i>

32:15.275 --> 32:16.651
Yes, I'll accept. Hope?

32:16.734 --> 32:18.150
<i>I'm taking the deal.</i>

32:19.150 --> 32:21.025
Hope, listen.

32:21.109 --> 32:24.359
I'm tired, Jessica.

32:24.442 --> 32:26.526
I just want this to be over.

32:27.150 --> 32:29.983
It won't be
as long as Kilgrave is out there.

32:30.067 --> 32:33.109
Yeah, well, at least I'll have a life.

32:33.192 --> 32:35.776
In 20 years, I could finish my degree.

32:38.859 --> 32:40.942
I don't want to die in here.

32:43.983 --> 32:46.776
<i>I've made my decision.</i>
I just thought that you should know.

32:46.859 --> 32:48.275
I've got him, Hope.

32:50.234 --> 32:51.401
What?

32:52.859 --> 32:54.651
Kilgrave is my prisoner.

32:57.234 --> 32:58.526
What do you mean?

32:58.609 --> 33:02.942
<i>I mean, I pumped him full of drugs</i>
and I dumped him in a cage.

33:03.025 --> 33:06.442
<i>We are so close to having</i>
the proof we need for reasonable doubt.

33:06.526 --> 33:09.859
<i>Hope... do not let him off the hook</i>
for what he did to you.

33:11.067 --> 33:12.359
To us.

33:23.067 --> 33:24.192
Okay.

33:27.734 --> 33:29.109
Thank you.

33:36.025 --> 33:38.609
Don't give me that look.
I'm getting her out of there.

33:40.275 --> 33:41.609
Shit.

33:51.025 --> 33:52.025
What?

33:54.192 --> 33:55.359
Jess?

34:06.734 --> 34:09.359
You're late.

34:09.442 --> 34:10.900
Where's the rest of them?

34:10.983 --> 34:13.650
I couldn't reach everyone.
You didn't give me much notice.

34:13.734 --> 34:15.900
I haven't heard from you in days
and I thought you were in jail.

34:15.983 --> 34:17.359
- Clearly I'm not.
- And what,

34:17.442 --> 34:19.650
you couldn't be bothered to tell me?

34:19.734 --> 34:22.983
I crossed a big line
to save you from yourself.

34:23.067 --> 34:25.775
- Do you even know what I did for you?
- I didn't ask you to.

34:25.859 --> 34:27.025
No.

34:27.109 --> 34:30.025
No, you do not get to play that card.
Not anymore.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.859
See this?
You're a part of this.

34:33.942 --> 34:35.525
Just take a look around.

34:35.609 --> 34:39.025
You said that you needed to talk.
They're all here to support you.

34:40.192 --> 34:41.818
Just let that sink in.

34:48.317 --> 34:50.692
Hey. All right, let's start.

34:52.317 --> 34:54.900
Well, speak at will.
No one's controlling this.

35:02.317 --> 35:04.067
I think I'll just listen for a while.

35:05.818 --> 35:09.651
I need to clear my head.
Everywhere I look, all I see is Kilgrave.

35:09.734 --> 35:12.192
- I guess I'll start.
- Thank you.

35:12.859 --> 35:16.942
Um, I was thinking the other day
about accountability.

35:17.025 --> 35:22.734
Because when Kilgrave was in control,
I wasn't accountable for what I did.

35:22.818 --> 35:25.192
Even though, at the time,
I really wanted to do it.

35:26.567 --> 35:31.734
So, how do I take responsibility
for anything if I don't, you know...

35:31.818 --> 35:33.776
Dude, you lost a jacket, move on.

35:33.859 --> 35:35.317
Jessica...

35:35.401 --> 35:37.067
Let's let someone else share.

35:39.401 --> 35:40.442
How about you?

35:41.734 --> 35:44.942
Betty just listens, like you,
and that's okay.

35:45.942 --> 35:48.359
I wanna hear Betty's story.

35:49.859 --> 35:53.150
When did you meet Kilgrave?
A long time ago?

35:54.442 --> 35:57.109
Would you say
that you know him intimately?

35:57.192 --> 35:58.234
Have you seen him naked?

35:58.317 --> 35:59.401
No, Jessica.

35:59.859 --> 36:02.942
- Wait for it. It'll be good.
- No, this is a victim support group.

36:03.025 --> 36:04.234
Not everyone here is a victim.

36:05.859 --> 36:07.192
Sorry.

36:07.275 --> 36:09.484
I've got to go.

36:11.234 --> 36:12.484
Where are you going?

36:12.567 --> 36:14.692
Hey! Leave that poor woman alone.

36:14.776 --> 36:17.526
That poor woman is Kilgrave's mother.

36:25.609 --> 36:26.900
Hey.

36:26.983 --> 36:28.734
Hey, hey, I wanna help.

36:28.818 --> 36:30.651
- Too bad.
- No, I need to help.

36:30.734 --> 36:31.818
I can't sleep at night.

36:31.859 --> 36:34.109
Every single time I close my eyes,
I just see Ruben's face.

36:34.192 --> 36:37.025
That is why I'm not
getting you involved.

36:37.109 --> 36:39.234
- You let this stuff get to you.
- "This stuff"?

36:39.317 --> 36:41.692
I scrubbed blood
off your floorboards, all right?

36:41.776 --> 36:43.818
I dumped a man's body in a river.

36:43.859 --> 36:45.818
And you wanna spend more time with me?

36:45.859 --> 36:48.776
Go back to that group.
Help those people.

36:48.859 --> 36:50.942
That's your superpower.

36:56.900 --> 36:58.526
Only a matter of time
before he found us.

36:58.609 --> 36:59.900
We never should've stopped moving.

36:59.983 --> 37:03.150
I'm sorry, Albert.
You were right.

37:04.609 --> 37:05.609
Hi, Dad.

37:10.025 --> 37:12.275
I see where your son gets his bad manners.

37:12.359 --> 37:15.025
Now you are coming with me to stop him.

37:15.109 --> 37:16.818
Stop him?

37:16.859 --> 37:18.526
Kevin didn't send you?

37:18.609 --> 37:20.692
No, but I bet he'll be glad to see you.

37:20.776 --> 37:24.234
You may have named him Kevin,
but you made him Kilgrave.

37:24.317 --> 37:26.109
- We didn't know what he'd become.
- Bullshit!

37:27.609 --> 37:30.401
I've seen the videos, the tests.

37:30.484 --> 37:32.067
You tried to play God!

37:32.900 --> 37:34.692
We tried to save him.

37:35.609 --> 37:38.609
Kevin was born
with a degenerative neural disease.

37:38.692 --> 37:41.651
He'd have been brain-dead
before he reached 12.

37:41.734 --> 37:47.942
His only hope was an experimental study
using a virus to repair his damaged DNA.

37:49.484 --> 37:52.025
So you infected him?

37:52.109 --> 37:53.275
Wow!

37:53.359 --> 37:56.484
I wish I had a Mother of the Year award
so I could bludgeon you with it.

37:56.567 --> 37:58.234
We loved our son.

37:59.275 --> 38:01.942
We wanted a cure and we found one.

38:02.025 --> 38:04.067
We didn't know
about the side effects until...

38:04.150 --> 38:06.776
Until things got bad and you jumped ship.

38:06.859 --> 38:08.609
No, we stayed and lived with it.

38:09.609 --> 38:12.776
We carried out
his every childish demand for years.

38:12.859 --> 38:15.734
He was throwing a tantrum,

38:15.818 --> 38:18.526
but I was busy ironing, and...

38:19.442 --> 38:22.567
I never should've yelled at him, but...

38:22.651 --> 38:24.567
We were living in fear,
so we ran.

38:24.651 --> 38:26.442
We've been running ever since.

38:27.983 --> 38:31.609
Well, you could've told someone,
or done something.

38:31.692 --> 38:35.859
Yours aren't the only lives
that little Kevin has destroyed.

38:36.442 --> 38:37.859
We know.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.942
We heard about that poor girl
who killed her parents.

38:41.025 --> 38:42.526
I knew it was Kevin.

38:42.609 --> 38:44.526
Louise insisted we make sure, so we came.

38:44.609 --> 38:47.818
Louise joined that ghoulish group
to torture herself.

38:47.859 --> 38:49.818
I hoped I could help.

38:49.859 --> 38:51.609
A lot of good it's done.

38:53.150 --> 38:54.567
Well, here's your chance
to help that girl.

38:54.651 --> 38:56.526
I am taking you to your son.

38:56.609 --> 38:59.818
We've only stayed alive this long
by keeping our distance.

38:59.900 --> 39:03.609
If your parenting didn't make him
a sociopath, the lack of it did.

39:04.234 --> 39:06.983
Either way, irresponsible.

39:09.734 --> 39:11.692
I'm going with her, Albert.

39:15.692 --> 39:17.317
You're not going alone.

39:21.734 --> 39:22.776
Have a good night.

39:22.859 --> 39:24.776
Yeah, you too. Take it easy.

40:13.526 --> 40:15.192
You're back.

40:15.275 --> 40:18.734
Jessica said she had something
urgent to show me.

40:18.818 --> 40:21.109
She'll be back soon.

40:22.526 --> 40:24.651
Why don't you go outside
and get some fresh air?

40:24.734 --> 40:27.401
Last thing I need
is another woman losing her mind.

40:28.484 --> 40:30.401
Yeah, I guess I could use a break.

40:47.442 --> 40:48.734
I'm listening.

40:57.692 --> 41:00.401
I'm checking on a patient,
Will Simpson.

41:02.275 --> 41:04.067
I doubt he's conscious.

41:06.442 --> 41:07.776
Simpson here.

41:10.401 --> 41:12.734
You sound... all right.

41:12.818 --> 41:15.109
<i>I told you, Kozlov was the guy.</i>

41:15.192 --> 41:18.484
And I wanted to see you again.

41:20.567 --> 41:22.942
<i>Are you with Jessica?</i>
With him?

41:26.484 --> 41:28.359
I know you won't do it.

41:28.442 --> 41:29.983
<i>I'm not like you.</i>

41:30.067 --> 41:31.859
It's a good thing.

41:31.942 --> 41:33.150
Now, you get out of there.

41:33.234 --> 41:34.859
<i>Get out of town.</i>

41:34.983 --> 41:37.818
<i>Jessica's an idiot if she thinks</i>
she can keep him locked up.

41:40.776 --> 41:41.818
<i>Trish...</i>

41:42.818 --> 41:44.818
<i>Tell me you're not gonna</i>
stay there with him.

41:50.942 --> 41:52.818
I'm glad you'll be okay.

41:56.317 --> 41:57.317
Trish.

41:58.401 --> 41:59.609
Trish!

42:06.401 --> 42:08.234
You're responding well to the meds.

42:08.317 --> 42:12.234
Feels good.
Like old times.

42:14.692 --> 42:17.651
- Give me a red.
- You had a red this morning.

42:17.734 --> 42:20.818
We altered protocol
after what happened in Damascus.

42:21.692 --> 42:23.526
One red to get you going.

42:24.567 --> 42:26.859
Two whites to keep you even.

42:27.484 --> 42:29.609
One blue to bring you down.

42:31.776 --> 42:33.150
Got it.

42:33.818 --> 42:35.317
Glad to have you back.

42:36.983 --> 42:38.983
We're going to do
important things together.

43:48.818 --> 43:50.818
We're about to get our proof.

43:50.900 --> 43:52.859
For Hope's sake,
you better be right.

43:52.942 --> 43:56.109
DA said she turned down the plea.
She'll seek two life terms now.

43:56.192 --> 43:57.442
She'll lose.

43:57.526 --> 43:58.942
Come on in!

44:09.442 --> 44:11.359
Are they the mad scientists?

44:11.442 --> 44:13.692
All the tests they did on him
were to save his life.

44:13.776 --> 44:16.859
He tortured them.
Everything Kilgrave said was a lie.

44:41.983 --> 44:45.109
If things go bad, I hit this switch.

44:45.192 --> 44:49.234
Everyone goes down and we pull you out.
You won't feel a thing.

44:49.317 --> 44:50.609
Mostly.

44:50.692 --> 44:53.192
- What if you're not fast enough?
- Don't worry, I'm fast enough.

44:53.275 --> 44:56.192
It's not worth the risk.
We need to find another way.

44:56.275 --> 44:57.442
We're going in, Albert.

44:58.942 --> 45:00.359
He's our responsibility.

45:06.359 --> 45:08.484
Hands above your head.

45:14.900 --> 45:16.484
I see you got my evidence.

45:16.567 --> 45:18.025
Oh, yeah.

45:18.109 --> 45:20.776
You convinced me you are one sick lady.

45:21.359 --> 45:22.983
- Now open that cell.
- Sure thing.

45:23.067 --> 45:24.484
One sec.

45:24.567 --> 45:25.567
Trish!

45:33.192 --> 45:34.692
Are you insane?

45:38.192 --> 45:40.859
You know, why don't you
just cuff me right now?

45:40.983 --> 45:43.442
Because I'm about to call 911.

45:43.526 --> 45:47.401
Well, then I will make sure to tell them
that you're an accomplice to kidnapping.

45:47.484 --> 45:51.275
Keep your eyes on that man in that cell.
Your testimony is gonna put him away.

45:52.818 --> 45:55.484
Now, let's give him something to witness.

45:56.401 --> 45:57.651
Come on.

46:47.317 --> 46:49.442
Hello, Kevin.

46:50.401 --> 46:51.983
Mum.

46:52.067 --> 46:53.067
Dad.

46:56.734 --> 46:59.983
Have they been giving you enough to eat?

47:09.776 --> 47:12.401
You might as well ask who fed me
when I was ten.

47:12.484 --> 47:15.359
Or 14, or 25.
You never cared then.

47:15.442 --> 47:17.900
Kevin, sweetheart.

47:17.983 --> 47:20.442
I used to wonder
if you thought about me growing up...

47:21.609 --> 47:23.359
begging for scraps like a dog.

47:23.442 --> 47:26.401
Or if you worried about when I got sick.

47:27.359 --> 47:30.067
Or when I was scared.
I was all alone, Mum.

47:32.359 --> 47:36.275
I had to make people feed me
and shelter me and care for me.

47:36.359 --> 47:38.192
That's how I learned to survive.

47:38.275 --> 47:41.192
Bollocks, Kevin.
You always knew how to give orders.

47:41.275 --> 47:43.651
Telling us when to eat,
when to sleep, when to piss.

47:43.734 --> 47:45.983
No, Albert.

47:46.983 --> 47:48.818
Oh, Dad, I've changed.

47:50.983 --> 47:52.484
Jessica taught me to help people.

47:56.442 --> 47:57.983
I saved children.

47:59.900 --> 48:01.651
I wondered if that would
make you proud of me.

48:01.734 --> 48:04.818
Oh, of course we're proud of you, Kevin.

48:05.401 --> 48:06.484
We love you.

48:06.567 --> 48:08.192
Then why did you leave?

48:08.859 --> 48:11.526
Your mother nearly died
after what you did to her!

48:11.609 --> 48:14.317
I was ten! I had a tantrum,
like a normal child.

48:14.401 --> 48:17.859
I didn't know what I was doing.
You didn't explain to me, you just left!

48:24.651 --> 48:26.275
We made a mistake.

48:29.401 --> 48:32.983
I promise, I will never leave you again.

48:33.067 --> 48:35.150
Louise, remember what he did.

48:36.401 --> 48:39.567
He's our son, Albert.

48:43.609 --> 48:44.734
Oh.

48:53.234 --> 48:55.734
I'm sorry I hurt you, Mum.

48:55.818 --> 48:56.900
Oh.

49:03.359 --> 49:06.234
Release me now
and I'll overlook the assault.

49:06.317 --> 49:08.983
We'll call it resisting arrest.

49:09.067 --> 49:10.359
It's not over yet.

49:10.442 --> 49:12.442
I'm sorry, Kevin.

49:17.651 --> 49:20.734
I am so sorry.

49:22.859 --> 49:25.109
I'm so sorry.

49:28.692 --> 49:30.025
Get them out now!

49:30.859 --> 49:32.025
Not yet.

49:34.484 --> 49:37.109
You're our responsibility.

49:38.275 --> 49:40.983
We have got to stop you.

49:43.983 --> 49:46.442
Yeah, I understand.

49:47.609 --> 49:48.609
Mum...

49:50.234 --> 49:51.484
pick up the scissors.

49:52.317 --> 49:53.734
No.

49:53.818 --> 49:55.692
Stay there, Dad.

49:56.692 --> 49:57.818
Take note.

49:59.442 --> 50:00.442
Okay.

50:05.776 --> 50:07.317
- She did it.
- She did what?

50:07.401 --> 50:09.651
- It's on tape.
- He didn't see it. It's not enough.

50:09.734 --> 50:11.150
This won't work.
Pull them out now!

50:11.234 --> 50:12.484
Mum...

50:14.317 --> 50:16.776
for every year that you left me alone...

50:18.109 --> 50:19.776
stab yourself.

50:25.651 --> 50:26.776
Got him.

50:39.818 --> 50:41.359
Everybody out! Run!

50:41.442 --> 50:43.942
- Go! Go! Run!
- Get me out of these.

50:46.275 --> 50:47.401
Jess, the keys! I need the...

50:54.484 --> 50:56.109
Please. Please.

50:56.192 --> 50:58.192
Don't just stand there, Dad.

50:58.275 --> 50:59.526
Pick up the scissors.

51:14.526 --> 51:16.109
No, not him, too.

51:21.192 --> 51:22.401
Get me out of here!

51:26.109 --> 51:28.275
Cut your heart out, Dad.

51:31.526 --> 51:33.859
Put a bullet in your skull, Patsy.

51:35.818 --> 51:37.567
Follow me, Detective.

51:58.609 --> 52:00.067
Let go of me, Jessica.

52:02.983 --> 52:05.109
Get her off me, Detective!

52:31.025 --> 52:36.025
Let go of me, Jessica.

53:02.025 --> 53:05.359
Get back here, Jessica.

53:10.484 --> 53:13.484
Now, Jessica!
