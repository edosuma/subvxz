WEBVTT

01:34.594 --> 01:36.179
Are you selfish, Dong-eun?

01:36.971 --> 01:38.431
Why are you studying this late?

01:38.515 --> 01:40.391
We're all waiting.

01:48.525 --> 01:49.609
You coming?

01:51.194 --> 01:54.030
Oh, right. Moon Dong-eun.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.032
You want to study architecture, right?

01:56.908 --> 02:00.161
Hey, ask me if you have
any questions, huh?

02:00.245 --> 02:02.539
If it's construction, I'm knowledged.

02:04.541 --> 02:07.627
-"Knowledgeable."
-That's what I said, you crazy bitch.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.546
No, dumbass, you said "knowledged."

02:09.629 --> 02:11.840
Don't try to teach me stuff,
you fucking moron.

02:43.705 --> 02:46.416
<i>All the feet</i>
<i>that walked next to yours,</i>

02:46.499 --> 02:48.168
<i>ready to inflict pain…</i>

02:50.587 --> 02:53.173
<i>All the lips that curled up with you</i>

02:53.256 --> 02:55.008
<i>when you laughed at others…</i>

02:56.718 --> 02:59.262
<i>All the eyes that looked on</i>

02:59.846 --> 03:01.556
<i>with no compassion…</i>

03:21.576 --> 03:24.120
<i>All the hands that held yours,</i>

03:25.622 --> 03:26.956
<i>that broke me to pieces…</i>

03:29.209 --> 03:30.168
<i>And your soul,</i>

03:30.919 --> 03:33.922
<i>which laughed joyously through all of it…</i>

03:35.673 --> 03:38.927
<i>That's how far</i>
<i>I'm planning to go, Yeon-jin.</i>

03:39.969 --> 03:41.888
<i>I won't show you forgiveness.</i>

03:42.764 --> 03:46.100
<i>And there will be no glory.</i>

03:48.353 --> 03:49.646
You crazy bitch!

03:52.023 --> 03:55.276
-Stop. Stop it!
-Why are you acting like a high schooler?

03:57.153 --> 03:59.030
Did all your dreams come true?

03:59.656 --> 04:01.783
It seems like you have
a pretty decent job right now,

04:01.866 --> 04:05.119
and you married a wealthy, connected man
when you were young and pretty.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.704
Are you living a happy life?

04:07.872 --> 04:11.000
You have what you wanted. Right, Yeon-jin?

04:15.964 --> 04:18.091
-Careful.
-Be careful with that.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.947
What are you trying to do?

04:41.030 --> 04:43.449
You must've seen
that article about my marriage!

04:43.950 --> 04:46.411
-What the fuck do you want from me?
-Hey, hey!

04:46.911 --> 04:48.830
You're not gonna kill her
right here and now.

04:48.913 --> 04:50.498
There's a crowd of kids outside.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.375
Be the bigger person.

04:52.959 --> 04:53.960
She's still a kid.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.170
An angry little kid.

04:59.382 --> 05:02.343
You guys
really haven't changed at all.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.346
Neither has your friendship. I'm jealous.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.683
Well, you've changed a bit.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.228
In high school,
you were like a black-and-white picture.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.814
You're more colorful now.

05:15.606 --> 05:16.566
Think so?

05:18.735 --> 05:20.153
I've got to get going, okay?

05:22.030 --> 05:24.032
Looking forward to your next forecast.

05:24.532 --> 05:27.035
I hope you don't mind
that I watch you, Yeon-jin.

05:30.371 --> 05:33.291
Anyway, nice to see you all.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.252
By the way, Jae-jun.

05:37.962 --> 05:41.132
How would you even know
what's "colorful" or not?

05:52.935 --> 05:56.272
UNGHAN HIGH SCHOOL
2022 PROUD ALUMNI AWARDS CEREMONY

06:13.915 --> 06:14.916
Here's the bag.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.084
You didn't come to work,

06:16.167 --> 06:18.252
and you've been
ignoring my calls all day long.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.130
You know what confuses me?

06:21.214 --> 06:23.299
Why I keep giving you
all these fucking paychecks

06:23.383 --> 06:24.759
when I seem to drive my car more.

06:26.594 --> 06:27.512
Sorry.

06:28.179 --> 06:29.597
I passed out kinda drunk.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.518
But anything else?

06:37.980 --> 06:39.816
Find out what Dong-eun's been up to.

06:43.945 --> 06:44.904
Uh, Moon Dong-eun?

06:46.572 --> 06:48.116
Ah, that girl--

06:48.199 --> 06:50.493
Yeah, that girl who you kissed once.

06:50.576 --> 06:51.828
How long will it take?

06:56.874 --> 06:58.042
By any chance,

07:00.545 --> 07:02.255
did you ever sleep with that girl?

07:04.006 --> 07:05.133
Did she have your kid?

07:06.634 --> 07:07.468
Are you fucking high?

07:08.302 --> 07:09.387
Are you insane?

07:09.470 --> 07:10.930
Have you finally lost it, you idiot?

07:13.433 --> 07:15.518
Oh, is it gonna be us three?

07:15.601 --> 07:16.769
It won't.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.235
He doesn't buy me fucking handbags.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.160
Wow,
the view's so pretty at night.

07:32.660 --> 07:36.080
Babe, should I just drop everything
and live here with you?

07:36.581 --> 07:38.082
What's your name again?

07:39.792 --> 07:40.835
Ha-na.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.422
Sweet Ha-na.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.966
You're not the sharpest tool
in the shed, are you?

07:48.009 --> 07:50.678
Ha-na. Do I look stupid?

07:52.096 --> 07:53.723
You can't even tell me your real name,

07:53.806 --> 07:55.224
but you've got big dreams.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.102
That makes me so fucking sad.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.403
Hey, Ha-na.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.822
You call yourself a redhead, right?

08:09.906 --> 08:11.699
Yeah.

08:15.036 --> 08:15.870
Are you blind?

08:19.957 --> 08:20.791
Ha-na.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.255
Guess what two bitches I hate the most?

08:27.381 --> 08:29.800
Anne of Green Gables
and Red Riding Hood Chacha.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.719
And since you're a redhead too,

08:33.137 --> 08:35.973
maybe I should show you
what I'd do to bitches like that.

08:36.557 --> 08:37.975
Huh?

08:39.810 --> 08:43.564
Call me if you get a consultation request
for Mr. Yoon in room 701.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.067
Excuse me, Yeo-jeong.
Can I ask you something?

08:46.150 --> 08:48.236
Ask me. He has to go now.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.279
You can go, I got this.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.074
I wouldn't be leaving
if you weren't the one in charge. Call me.

08:53.157 --> 08:54.158
I'll be back later.

08:58.579 --> 08:59.664
What's your question?

08:59.747 --> 09:02.583
I heard a rumor
that Yeo-jeong's the director's son.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.211
Really? He's the director's son?

09:05.294 --> 09:06.837
Not the daughter, huh?

09:06.921 --> 09:08.589
Because pink looks great on him.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.049
Wow, so it's true, huh?

09:10.550 --> 09:12.009
I just found out yesterday.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.429
So then, Jong-heon, Yeo-jeong's father,

09:15.513 --> 09:19.684
is the former director
who passed away, wasn't that right?

09:19.767 --> 09:21.352
You're really gonna go there?

09:21.435 --> 09:22.687
Just look it up online.

09:27.733 --> 09:30.570
Did he really get murdered
by the patient that he saved?

09:31.195 --> 09:33.322
Today is the anniversary of his death.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.033
-That's why Yeo-jeong went home.
-Oh.

09:37.702 --> 09:40.121
But how do you know
the anniversary of his death?

09:40.204 --> 09:42.623
Because Yeo-jeong's mother is
my second cousin.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.875
Ah. What?

09:57.305 --> 09:59.056
Shouldn't a doctor know not to smoke?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.270
I have to do something to unwind.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.899
You ate before you came here, right?

10:08.983 --> 10:10.234
Are you drinking tonight?

10:12.153 --> 10:14.488
Your uncles are already completely drunk.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.159
-You ready?
-I'll write it now.

10:24.665 --> 10:25.541
Use this.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.376
It was your father's.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.004
It's yours now.

10:39.263 --> 10:42.099
Let's go. Your father is waiting for you.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.501
JOIN US, FATHER,
WHO DEVOTED YOUR LIFE TO LEARNING

11:38.781 --> 11:41.992
-<i>I thought I saw a ghost.</i>
-<i>Bet she showed up on purpose.</i>

11:42.076 --> 11:44.745
<i>She knew what she was doing.</i>
<i>Nobody knows what she's up to?</i>

11:44.829 --> 11:46.539
<i>Myeong-o, you should look into it.</i>

11:46.622 --> 11:48.624
<i>Who's gonna pay me</i>
<i>for that, and how much?</i>

12:03.889 --> 12:05.933
<i>Bring me</i>
<i>what I asked for, first.</i>

12:15.109 --> 12:16.736
The color…

12:17.987 --> 12:19.071
Hey.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.492
Uh, show me that one.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.958
<i>By the way,</i>
<i>are you okay, Yeon-jin?</i>

12:31.041 --> 12:34.086
<i>What if weird rumors start spreading</i>
<i>online or at your work?</i>

12:34.587 --> 12:37.673
<i>What if someone throws an egg</i>
<i>at you on your way back home?</i>

12:37.757 --> 12:39.842
<i>Dong-eun is such a bitch.</i>

12:39.925 --> 12:40.885
<i>Sad face.</i>

12:40.968 --> 12:42.720
This fucking bitch.

12:43.637 --> 12:44.472
MY PUPPY

12:46.390 --> 12:48.934
Hi sweetie, how was lunch at school today?

12:49.018 --> 12:50.686
I'm about to head home right now.

12:50.770 --> 12:55.399
<i>Oh, okay. Mom, I spilled milk</i>
<i>all over my slippers at school,</i>

12:55.483 --> 12:56.859
<i>so I'm barefoot right now.</i>

12:56.942 --> 12:58.611
You're barefoot now?

12:59.320 --> 13:00.738
That's so dangerous, hon!

13:01.238 --> 13:03.115
Did you tell your teacher what happened?

13:03.616 --> 13:06.660
<i>Our homeroom teacher</i>
<i>isn't Mr. Yang anymore.</i>

13:08.078 --> 13:09.330
What do you mean by that?

13:09.413 --> 13:11.540
<i>We're going to get a new one.</i>

13:11.624 --> 13:12.958
<i>She's coming soon.</i>

13:13.626 --> 13:14.460
Really?

13:15.419 --> 13:17.046
I didn't hear anything about…

13:18.130 --> 13:19.632
I'll visit your school tomorrow.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.551
I think you'll be happy.
She's your friend.

13:23.427 --> 13:24.970
Huh? Who's that?

13:25.054 --> 13:26.347
<i>My new homeroom teacher.</i>

13:26.430 --> 13:28.766
<i>Her name's Ms. Moon Dong-eun.</i>

13:33.896 --> 13:36.774
Your new teacher is Moon Dong-eun?

13:37.358 --> 13:38.692
Nice to meet you.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.863
Please tell her

13:42.947 --> 13:45.658
everything she needs to know
about our school.

13:45.741 --> 13:46.742
-Mr. Principal.
-We will.

13:47.326 --> 13:51.038
All right, thank you.
Make sure you take good care of Ms. Moon.

13:51.121 --> 13:53.207
<i>I'm going to be</i>
<i>your new homeroom teacher,</i>

13:53.290 --> 13:56.502
since Mr. Yang had to leave,
and I'm very excited to be here.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.715
From this moment forward,

14:01.799 --> 14:04.760
the following things
will be meaningless in this class.

14:05.761 --> 14:08.973
Your parents' money.
Your parents' connections.

14:09.557 --> 14:10.975
Your parents' jobs.

14:12.017 --> 14:15.437
And please make sure you are
always following these rules.

14:16.063 --> 14:18.899
You may not bully another student

14:19.567 --> 14:23.112
because your parents own nicer clothes,
better cars, or bigger homes.

14:24.321 --> 14:26.448
If you still decide to bully a friend,

14:26.532 --> 14:30.452
I will make you and your family
beg for forgiveness.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.454
The mother who bought your clothes,

14:33.455 --> 14:35.124
the father who drives that sports car,

14:35.207 --> 14:37.251
and the grandparents
who bought that house.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.923
Let's make this a great year.

14:43.507 --> 14:45.384
We will!

14:51.265 --> 14:52.933
Let's brush our teeth.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.769
Give me your toothbrush.

14:58.647 --> 15:00.691
I wonder how she knows the chairman.

15:00.774 --> 15:02.860
I mean, he introduced her himself.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.655
Maybe she's a relative.

15:07.656 --> 15:11.744
Come on, Mr. Kang,
are you trying to act like a good guy,

15:11.827 --> 15:13.954
pretending to be all innocent and naive?

15:16.206 --> 15:17.333
You proud of yourself?

15:19.877 --> 15:20.878
I'm sorry.

15:20.961 --> 15:22.504
She's fucking him.

15:23.839 --> 15:24.882
Definitely.

15:25.674 --> 15:26.550
Hundred percent.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.735
You're Ye-sol's homeroom teacher?

16:28.612 --> 16:29.530
Seriously?

16:31.740 --> 16:34.618
Ye-sol was barefoot
because she spilled milk on herself.

16:35.786 --> 16:38.580
Her tiny, little feet
were so small and soft.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.834
This isn't a coincidence, right?

16:42.418 --> 16:43.335
Not at all.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.839
No part of my journey here
has been a coincidence.

16:49.967 --> 16:52.177
I've walked into your trap, haven't I?

16:52.261 --> 16:53.804
Right into your little trap.

16:55.806 --> 16:56.807
Unbelievable.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.979
I thought you'd find
some shitty guy somewhere,

17:02.062 --> 17:04.356
have a bunch of shitty children with him,

17:04.440 --> 17:05.691
and live a shitty life.

17:05.774 --> 17:06.942
But I'm impressed.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.944
How long have you been planning this?

17:09.028 --> 17:10.738
I'm disappointed you don't know.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.239
I told you, you're my dream.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.534
I said I'd see you again. Remember that?

17:17.828 --> 17:21.665
I bet you had fun every single day
as you made your way here.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.668
Trying to get here
was really, really tough.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.171
But I admit, it's pretty fun now.

17:27.254 --> 17:29.631
I wish you had died
back in fucking high school!

17:29.715 --> 17:30.966
Where would the fun be?

17:31.759 --> 17:33.927
Even an evil bitch like you
is living a great life,

17:34.011 --> 17:35.012
so why not?

17:36.847 --> 17:38.974
Then we'd never have met each other again.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.144
And his is so fun for me.

17:42.978 --> 17:46.190
Welcome to my classroom,
where I make the rules, Yeon-jin.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.863
Oh, right. Of course you do.

17:53.989 --> 17:56.575
If nothing about this was coincidental,

17:56.658 --> 17:58.744
I'm sure you've got
some real fucked-up rules.

17:59.328 --> 18:03.165
But a nobody like you
doesn't stand a fucking chance.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.627
Okay, fine. Do your best.

18:08.295 --> 18:09.129
Good luck.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.107
HYE-JEONG: REMEMBER
OUR SENIOR YEAR HOMEROOM TEACHER?

18:28.190 --> 18:29.441
HIS WIFE JUST CONTACTED ME

18:29.525 --> 18:30.776
JAE-JUN: SUCH A SOCIALITE

18:30.859 --> 18:32.111
HYE-JEONG: HE'S DEAD

18:35.781 --> 18:37.741
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>that teacher's dead.</i>

18:52.381 --> 18:54.967
<i>So you grew up</i>
<i>to become a teacher?</i>

18:55.551 --> 18:57.052
You went to school?

18:58.053 --> 18:59.138
Yes, Mr. Kim.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.098
And it was all thanks to you.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.351
So I came here to thank you.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.480
Oh, uh, hey, I'll take that.

19:08.564 --> 19:11.066
My father has asthma,
so he can't be near flowers,

19:11.150 --> 19:12.234
especially lilies.

19:13.443 --> 19:15.946
Then these can be
your congratulatory flowers.

19:16.530 --> 19:17.531
Congratulations.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.325
I heard you passed
your School Inspector Exam.

19:20.409 --> 19:23.328
How'd you find out
about that already?

19:24.037 --> 19:25.914
I came here as soon as I found out.

19:26.415 --> 19:29.459
I passed the first part of the exam,
and I just have the interview left.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.795
I'm a bit worried about
the in-depth interview, though.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.547
Come on, there's no need to worry.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.133
Your family's full of great educators.

19:37.467 --> 19:39.261
On the day
I tried to withdraw from school,

19:39.344 --> 19:41.638
-you even took off your watch--
-Shut your goddamned mouth!

19:41.722 --> 19:42.681
Uh, Dad, what--

19:42.764 --> 19:45.225
You're nothing but a fucking leech!

19:45.809 --> 19:47.811
You're a piece of garbage, you bitch!

19:48.312 --> 19:50.981
Hey! Stop, Dad! Hey, hey!

19:51.481 --> 19:55.694
Hey, do you really think
you'll be fine after ruining my life? Huh?

19:57.154 --> 19:59.406
If I had known
that this was going to happen,

19:59.489 --> 20:02.534
-I would have killed you then, you little…
-Jesus, Dad!

20:02.618 --> 20:06.288
Mr. Kim, were you concerned at all
when you ruined mine?

20:06.371 --> 20:09.082
Dong-eun, hold on,
you need to calm down as well.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.709
Come on, Dad, go inside.

20:11.501 --> 20:13.337
The neighbors might see you. Come on.

20:13.420 --> 20:17.132
Those are all lies. Okay?
Don't listen to her!

20:25.224 --> 20:26.141
Moon Dong-eun.

20:27.517 --> 20:30.395
What is going on here?
What's this? What happened?

20:31.021 --> 20:34.441
I decided to tell you
before I posted on the official forum.

20:34.524 --> 20:36.610
Post what? What'd you say?

20:37.194 --> 20:40.155
Of course, I know
that you didn't do anything wrong.

20:40.656 --> 20:41.740
Still,

20:43.075 --> 20:44.785
I didn't do anything wrong either.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.538
And you're a fully grown adult now.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.623
But you know…

20:51.166 --> 20:53.210
I was only 17 years old.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.347
Did you do that?

21:07.266 --> 21:08.684
You did that to Mr. Kim?

21:09.268 --> 21:10.978
Well, what exactly
are you asking me about?

21:11.770 --> 21:12.688
His death,

21:13.772 --> 21:14.940
or his punishment?

21:18.735 --> 21:19.903
Dad!

21:19.987 --> 21:22.030
Oh my God, Dad!

21:24.825 --> 21:26.034
Oh my God!

21:28.328 --> 21:30.455
The congratulatory flowers
are here.

21:34.876 --> 21:36.628
I'm a father too, now, Dad.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.757
A father should do everything
for his child, shouldn't he?

21:41.425 --> 21:43.510
What do… What are you…

21:43.593 --> 21:46.596
What are you…

21:46.680 --> 21:48.473
I only have the interview left.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.393
I'm so close to my goal.

21:52.060 --> 21:54.438
And I'll try my best
to help you with that.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.442
Uh, I may have retired, but--

21:58.525 --> 21:59.943
Can you open the window?

22:00.861 --> 22:02.195
No, no, no.

22:03.071 --> 22:04.281
Don't be like that, huh?

22:04.364 --> 22:07.034
You know that rumors
travel fast in this industry.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.118
Rumors spread,

22:08.201 --> 22:09.828
and they become your reputation.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.583
Take this back.

22:17.294 --> 22:18.295
Okay.

22:18.795 --> 22:21.506
Soo-han, please open the window…

22:22.841 --> 22:25.093
There's only one thing you can do for me.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.680
You need to remain

22:29.639 --> 22:31.224
a proud father I can respect,

22:31.308 --> 22:33.727
the man who received
the Order of Service Merit.

22:35.020 --> 22:38.065
Do that for me. Please.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.444
Soo-han, open the window…

22:49.785 --> 22:52.412
Oh my God! Dad, Dad!

23:01.380 --> 23:03.298
<i>Mr. Kim brought that on himself.</i>

23:03.382 --> 23:05.425
I didn't do anything.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.762
And if you want
to look for another culprit,

23:08.845 --> 23:10.931
that would be you, not me.

23:12.682 --> 23:13.683
You fucking bitch.

23:15.268 --> 23:16.686
Right, that's it.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.940
I'm so glad
that you haven't changed a bit.

23:21.817 --> 23:22.734
How about now,

23:23.777 --> 23:26.029
we discuss what actually brought you here?

23:27.072 --> 23:27.989
About your daughter.

23:31.284 --> 23:35.288
Ye-sol is innocent,
soft-hearted, and kind.

23:36.206 --> 23:37.457
I guess Ye-sol

23:39.126 --> 23:40.710
will really be your punishment after all.

23:40.794 --> 23:42.212
I'll fucking kill you.

23:43.463 --> 23:46.216
If you even touch
a single hair on Ye-sol's head,

23:46.800 --> 23:48.051
you are fucked.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.886
I'm so curious.

23:50.720 --> 23:51.972
What will you do?

23:52.973 --> 23:56.435
You've already broken my whole body.
You've already crushed my soul.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.645
Is there anything left for you to do?

24:02.607 --> 24:03.817
Transferring Ye-sol?

24:04.317 --> 24:05.694
Don't even think about it.

24:06.611 --> 24:09.906
Because I'll just move schools with her.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.909
From now on, you are going to suffer.

24:13.827 --> 24:15.203
Just like I did.

24:58.747 --> 24:59.831
Fuck this!

25:30.028 --> 25:32.280
<i>How much should I give</i>
<i>for Mr. Kim's mourning?</i>

25:32.364 --> 25:33.949
<i>Fuck, his wife texted me again.</i>

25:34.032 --> 25:37.285
<i>100,000 won for schoolmates,</i>
<i>500,000 for friends,</i>

25:37.369 --> 25:40.997
<i>1,000,000 won for pet dogs,</i>
<i>50,000 won for your homeroom teacher.</i>

25:41.081 --> 25:43.917
<i>How much</i>
<i>will you give at my wedding, then?</i>

25:44.417 --> 25:45.669
<i>One hundred.</i>

25:45.752 --> 25:47.587
<i>Oh my God.</i>

25:48.505 --> 25:49.339
<i>Won.</i>

25:52.425 --> 25:53.426
That bitch…

26:35.260 --> 26:38.513
I'm sorry to ask, but do you mind
holding the umbrella, sir?

26:39.306 --> 26:41.641
The wine that the secretary's office
told me to give to you

26:41.725 --> 26:42.976
is in the passenger seat.

26:51.401 --> 26:53.570
It's from Mr. Shin, from Hanjinmaru.

26:54.404 --> 26:56.656
Oh. You can drink that.

26:56.740 --> 26:59.492
If Mr. Shin sent it,
it's worth over a million won.

26:59.576 --> 27:00.410
What?

27:01.161 --> 27:03.371
Oh, no, no, I can't do that, sir.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.960
Well, it looks like my hands are full.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.422
I can't take something so expensive that…

27:13.256 --> 27:16.509
I don't know how to drink this.
It's such fine wine, sir.

27:16.593 --> 27:20.263
I should be the one
telling you that, which I am.

27:21.389 --> 27:22.974
So I don't know what the issue is.

27:23.808 --> 27:25.018
Sir?

27:25.101 --> 27:28.688
Buy some really cheap wine
at the convenience store.

27:28.772 --> 27:30.023
Buy some cheese too.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.859
Drink the convenience store wine first,

27:32.942 --> 27:33.943
then that.

27:35.695 --> 27:37.030
Then you'll learn how to drink it.

27:37.113 --> 27:38.615
I'll see you tomorrow.

28:08.728 --> 28:10.772
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>what I used to wish for?</i>

28:13.650 --> 28:14.984
Hi, Daddy!

28:16.111 --> 28:18.822
Oh, my sweet angel. My treasure.

28:18.905 --> 28:19.948
Oh, baby.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.619
<i>I used to wish that one day,</i>

28:25.203 --> 28:28.581
<i>I would be able to forget</i>
<i>your name and your face,</i>

28:29.249 --> 28:32.585
<i>and that I wouldn't even remember you.</i>

28:32.669 --> 28:34.087
<i>That I'd be able to say</i>

28:35.213 --> 28:36.214
<i>"Who was that?"</i>

28:37.674 --> 28:40.719
<i>if I happened to run into you somewhere.</i>

28:43.638 --> 28:47.267
<i>Think about how sad all of it is.</i>

28:48.685 --> 28:51.980
<i>My entire world is all about you.</i>

28:53.732 --> 28:55.984
<i>And because my world is all about you,</i>

28:57.360 --> 28:59.988
<i>the world that your daughter</i>
<i>will live in from now on</i>

29:00.697 --> 29:01.865
<i>will be all about me.</i>

29:03.950 --> 29:07.370
<i>I promise I'll take responsibility</i>
<i>for that resentment,</i>

29:08.747 --> 29:10.540
<i>in return for my revenge.</i>

29:16.671 --> 29:20.842
TO YEON-JIN

29:35.774 --> 29:37.942
How did this happen? Who did this to you?

29:43.072 --> 29:45.241
I got the picture
that you sent over to me,

29:47.160 --> 29:49.829
along with the photo you sent of So-hee.

29:50.663 --> 29:52.081
Thank you so much for that, ma'am.

29:52.165 --> 29:53.917
Of course, I needed to.

29:55.502 --> 29:57.045
I was young back then, too.

29:58.838 --> 30:00.924
Were you close back then with So-hee?

30:05.386 --> 30:07.931
Can I have some pads? Ones without wings.

30:08.014 --> 30:09.098
Yes, one moment.

30:16.523 --> 30:19.275
Here's the hydrogen peroxide
and the burn ointment.

30:19.359 --> 30:20.443
4,700 won.

30:27.367 --> 30:28.201
<i>No.</i>

30:28.284 --> 30:29.118
YOON SO-HEE

30:29.202 --> 30:30.745
<i>When So-hee was getting bullied,</i>

30:32.080 --> 30:32.914
<i>I was</i>

30:34.874 --> 30:36.417
a bystander.

30:37.377 --> 30:39.462
And then later, I became a victim too.

30:42.340 --> 30:43.800
And that means that now,

30:45.385 --> 30:47.178
I'm going to be the perpetrator.

30:48.388 --> 30:49.973
It might be a little too late,

30:50.598 --> 30:52.433
but I can't stay a bystander.

30:53.768 --> 30:54.602
Then…

30:56.354 --> 30:58.606
will this be the start
of a long battle for you?

30:59.732 --> 31:00.567
Yeah.

31:02.318 --> 31:04.654
Well, the only thing I can tell you is

31:06.114 --> 31:07.282
I hope you win.

31:08.992 --> 31:12.245
I was rooting for you
back when you were 17 years old,

31:12.328 --> 31:15.540
and now that you're 35,
I'm still cheering you on.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.295
Thank you.

31:21.921 --> 31:22.755
I will

31:24.507 --> 31:26.009
make sure I win this time.

31:37.687 --> 31:40.356
There you are. You had me worried.

31:41.441 --> 31:42.609
Why would I not show up now?

31:43.318 --> 31:45.737
-Heard you met with the others.
-You didn't tell them, did you?

31:46.237 --> 31:47.071
That you met me.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.823
Why would I tell them about that?

31:49.699 --> 31:52.702
I've bet everything I have on you. All in.

31:55.079 --> 31:55.914
So, listen,

31:58.750 --> 32:01.252
you're dead if you drag me
into some half-baked scheme.

32:07.967 --> 32:09.302
You eaten yet?

32:13.556 --> 32:14.724
It won't take too long.

32:14.807 --> 32:16.893
We can make it long. Let's get some food.

32:17.727 --> 32:18.561
What do you want?

32:27.737 --> 32:28.821
Excuse me.

32:29.405 --> 32:30.740
One bottle of soju.

32:35.119 --> 32:36.120
Eat something.

32:36.913 --> 32:37.789
Already ate.

32:38.790 --> 32:39.666
Show me.

32:53.471 --> 32:54.305
Want a drink?

32:54.389 --> 32:55.765
I already had some.

33:05.608 --> 33:06.943
Sa-ra's drug account book.

33:07.443 --> 33:09.278
The guy Hye-jeong's obsessed with.

33:13.366 --> 33:14.367
And the hair I gave you?

33:15.827 --> 33:16.995
Matched.

33:20.623 --> 33:23.292
For real? Jae-jun has a kid out there?

33:23.793 --> 33:25.628
-Where?
-That's my card to play.

33:27.714 --> 33:28.548
You take this.

33:28.631 --> 33:29.549
MORTUARY

33:32.635 --> 33:35.722
Why am I going to a mortuary?

33:36.889 --> 33:40.476
-This a better card to play?
-It is if you're just looking for money.

33:40.560 --> 33:43.146
When you're there,
you'll see who's waiting.

33:47.150 --> 33:49.068
So, this is gonna make me some money,

33:50.069 --> 33:50.903
huh?

34:01.914 --> 34:03.583
This is D-3. Right here.

34:10.590 --> 34:12.425
YOON SO-HEE
PROCESSED ON 12/15/2004

34:15.178 --> 34:16.012
This means…

34:17.597 --> 34:21.059
So-hee has been kept in here
for over a decade?

34:21.142 --> 34:22.268
Yeah, she has.

34:22.351 --> 34:24.520
A hundred million of unpaid bills.

34:25.021 --> 34:28.691
The police concluded it was a suicide,
but her parents still don't agree.

34:29.275 --> 34:31.736
And the parents haven't been
picking up our calls.

34:31.819 --> 34:35.281
We can't remove the corpse
if the family members don't consent.

34:36.282 --> 34:37.283
Can I, uh…

34:40.328 --> 34:43.247
Can I see it now?
You know, uh, the corpse?

34:43.331 --> 34:44.707
Oh, I don't think…

34:46.292 --> 34:48.669
-You're not family, are you?
-No. Uh…

34:49.253 --> 34:50.254
We were friends.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.965
We hung out a lot in school.

34:53.049 --> 34:55.676
Then you need to be accompanied
by a family member.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.678
This is a big problem for us too.

34:57.762 --> 35:01.808
So just try to convince
the family members, will you? Huh?

35:01.891 --> 35:02.850
About her body.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.103
It's fine if they give up on it,
all right?

35:08.856 --> 35:10.942
<i>You want to know</i>
<i>what I want, Yeon-jin?</i>

35:12.985 --> 35:16.072
<i>Do you think I could use</i>
<i>Myeong-o's butterfly wings</i>

35:16.155 --> 35:17.365
<i>to cause a hurricane?</i>

35:19.242 --> 35:22.578
<i>Too bad that he doesn't have</i>
<i>any wings Yeon-jin.,</i>

35:27.250 --> 35:29.418
<i>You and I both know</i>

35:29.502 --> 35:31.671
<i>he doesn't deserve</i>
<i>anything that beautiful.</i>

35:37.885 --> 35:40.596
<i>Myeong-o is nothing but an SD card.</i>

35:41.472 --> 35:43.224
<i>And I put him in the camera</i>

35:43.307 --> 35:45.726
<i>because I need him</i>
<i>to take a picture for me.</i>

35:46.769 --> 35:49.355
This really gonna
make me some money.

35:51.357 --> 35:55.027
Moon Dong-eun,
you're a lot more interesting now.

36:07.832 --> 36:13.045
ROOM 701
PATIENT: YOON JEONG-HWAN

36:20.678 --> 36:22.680
Did Mr. Yun get moved from room 701?

36:23.556 --> 36:27.310
Oh, you didn't know?
He suddenly went into shock this morning.

36:59.467 --> 37:01.886
Oh, are you okay?

37:02.470 --> 37:03.387
Isn't that hot?

37:08.309 --> 37:09.310
No, I'm okay.

37:39.298 --> 37:43.344
Ye-sol, did anyone mess with you
at school today? Did anyone hit you?

37:43.427 --> 37:44.512
Mommy, what's wrong?

37:44.595 --> 37:48.015
Even if your teacher does something
as punishment, that's not okay.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.851
Did anybody put something
really hot on your body?

37:50.935 --> 37:52.770
Why would anyone do that?

37:52.853 --> 37:54.105
That's so mean.

37:54.605 --> 37:56.482
You should be scolded, then.

37:57.775 --> 38:00.653
I'm going to play Among Us
with my friends.

38:04.782 --> 38:05.908
Ye-sol.

38:15.876 --> 38:18.254
<i>Must visit</i>
<i>on Fridays once a week.</i>

38:19.088 --> 38:21.966
<i>Around three out of five pictures</i>
<i>I take are in focus now.</i>

38:29.682 --> 38:32.143
PAGODA GO CLUB

40:12.451 --> 40:16.163
<i>You know, I learned</i>
<i>the game of Go very quickly, Yeon-jin.</i>

40:17.039 --> 40:18.958
<i>It's a game with a clear purpose,</i>

40:19.458 --> 40:23.712
<i>where you can win if you take the house</i>
<i>that your opponent carefully built.</i>

40:25.881 --> 40:27.133
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

40:38.436 --> 40:40.521
You haven't been here for a while.

40:40.604 --> 40:42.356
Yeah. I was working.

40:44.608 --> 40:45.776
And what do you do for work?

40:46.735 --> 40:49.530
Backstabbing naive men,
making them cry, ruining lives.

40:52.032 --> 40:53.325
You get a lot of money from that?

40:54.076 --> 40:55.202
No, not really.

40:56.036 --> 40:57.204
I'm a pretty good person.

41:03.043 --> 41:05.004
Where did you learn how to play Go?

41:06.172 --> 41:07.298
At a park somewhere.

41:08.090 --> 41:11.177
All your answers are unexpected.

41:36.076 --> 41:37.453
It's 20,000 won per round?

41:47.254 --> 41:48.088
Final move.

41:49.757 --> 41:51.133
There's no way I can win.

41:53.177 --> 41:55.304
You gonna wire me the money, right?

41:56.222 --> 41:57.056
What?

41:57.973 --> 41:58.807
Oh.

42:06.273 --> 42:07.525
That was pretty fun.

42:10.653 --> 42:11.987
Fifty thousand.

42:14.114 --> 42:15.282
One more game?

42:18.661 --> 42:20.162
<i>By the way, Yeon-jin.</i>

42:20.663 --> 42:24.458
<i>Do you want to know</i>
<i>the real reason why I like to play Go?</i>

42:27.795 --> 42:28.837
Wouldn't that be gambling?

42:30.965 --> 42:31.799
Would it?

42:32.299 --> 42:36.679
<i>When you play Go,</i>
<i>you pursue your desires in silence.</i>

42:36.762 --> 42:39.390
<i>You seduce, and you fall.</i>

42:39.890 --> 42:41.392
<i>You strip each other bare.</i>

42:43.185 --> 42:45.229
<i>And if your opponent doesn't reciprocate…</i>

42:48.274 --> 42:49.108
<i>well, then…</i>

42:51.610 --> 42:53.112
<i>it's just a game of Go.</i>

42:54.530 --> 42:57.199
Gambling sounds fun.
