WEBVTT

00:07.967 --> 00:11.262
No. Please, Agreus, please.

00:12.722 --> 00:14.598
You were very, very lucky

00:14.598 --> 00:16.600
that it was Agreus who was
handed that gun, not me.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.852
<i>What are you
going to do to me?</i>

00:17.852 --> 00:20.521
We are going to escape
this place, today.

00:20.521 --> 00:21.856
I think Vignette's gonna die.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.157
Millworthy!

00:31.157 --> 00:33.117
Where's Vignette?

00:37.747 --> 00:40.249
<i>Just run.
Run for your fucking life.</i>

00:40.249 --> 00:41.625
And I know that when
you make these promises,

00:41.625 --> 00:42.918
you believe what you're saying.

00:42.918 --> 00:45.504
- Of course I do.
- But I can't rely on you.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.256
Because there's always
something or someone

00:47.256 --> 00:48.591
more important than me.

00:48.591 --> 00:49.967
I think I'm done.

00:49.967 --> 00:52.219
Hey, this is the moment
we've been waiting for.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.054
We're gonna tear down that wire.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.973
You're gonna have to do it
without me.

00:57.850 --> 00:58.976
Here.

00:58.976 --> 01:01.187
We need your help
to catch this thing.

01:01.187 --> 01:03.105
It's a shape-shifter,
for fuck's sake.

01:03.105 --> 01:05.816
It could be anyone.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.777
It's like every murder was
designed to stir up trouble

01:07.777 --> 01:09.653
between humans and fae.

01:09.653 --> 01:11.447
Do us a favor, Berwick.

01:11.447 --> 01:13.282
Fuck off.

01:13.282 --> 01:15.409
Rycroft Philostrate.

01:15.409 --> 01:19.246
You will be remanded into
police custody on one condition:

01:19.246 --> 01:21.707
you help us catch
this Critch monster.

01:21.707 --> 01:23.918
All right.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.378
I'll help.

01:54.323 --> 01:55.533
Ah.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.797
I think you may wish
to slow down, my dear.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.049
Oh, Agreus, relax.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.634
Have some fun.

02:19.098 --> 02:22.434
Ah. <i>Na zdraví,</i> Mr. Kastor.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.854
- <i>Na zdraví.</i>
- Ah. <i>Na zdraví.</i>

02:24.854 --> 02:26.063
<i>Na zdraví.</i>

02:29.984 --> 02:33.320
- Oh, uh...
- Oh, come on.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.739
Oh, would you like
a dance, Comrade?

02:35.739 --> 02:38.868
If you can keep up with her,
be my guest.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.772
Come with me, Comrade.

03:08.772 --> 03:11.358
I've something
I'd like to show you.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.193
Should I...

03:13.193 --> 03:15.279
Uh, what should I do
with my beer?

03:19.575 --> 03:21.535
Set it down.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.621
We'll be right back
for it later.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.026
Hey!

03:54.026 --> 03:56.695
You're a good dancer.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.656
- Not as good as you.
- Oh, thank you.

04:00.282 --> 04:03.202
- Finishing school.
- Ah, I understand.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.747
Oh...

04:06.747 --> 04:09.625
Ah. Are you all right?

04:09.625 --> 04:12.628
Yes, I'll be fine, I just...

04:12.628 --> 04:15.798
- I just need a moment.
- Ah, having too much fun, huh?

04:17.257 --> 04:19.635
I need to find the ladies'.

04:19.635 --> 04:22.346
Okay.

04:23.973 --> 04:25.683
Let's dance!

04:25.683 --> 04:27.559
Uh...

04:32.481 --> 04:34.525
We said two passengers. Two.

04:34.525 --> 04:37.653
Not three.
There's no room for him.

04:39.655 --> 04:41.407
Nonsense,
it's a sizable ship.

04:41.407 --> 04:43.409
- Of course there's room.
- Bad enough

04:43.409 --> 04:45.452
with three of us
crammed in the bilge for a week.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.996
- But four?
- I'm sorry, sir.

04:46.996 --> 04:49.123
The bilge?
You-you can't possibly...

04:49.123 --> 04:51.250
My brother will manage
perfectly well in the bilge,

04:51.250 --> 04:53.252
won't he?

04:53.252 --> 04:55.087
Yes, of course.

04:55.087 --> 04:58.257
If they catch us, we're dead.

04:58.257 --> 05:00.926
- One loud sneeze...
- I understand
it's an inconvenience.

05:00.926 --> 05:03.220
We'll double your fee,
of course.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.229
Pact ships! Coming in!

05:24.783 --> 05:26.910
Agreus...

05:28.954 --> 05:30.748
Get down.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.753
- We need to move.
- This way.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.465
Report
to your squads.

05:39.465 --> 05:41.300
Form ranks.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.769
The Pact will not spare
a single one of us.

05:51.769 --> 05:55.064
We fight, comrades.
We fight or we die.

05:55.064 --> 05:57.107
Gather your men
in the square! Let's go!

06:01.361 --> 06:03.322
Everyone,
pick up munitions!

07:37.708 --> 07:39.459
<i>It is bedlam out there.</i>

07:39.459 --> 07:42.087
The monster,
escaped Critch terrorists

07:42.087 --> 07:44.423
crawling all over
this fucking city.

07:44.423 --> 07:48.635
And here you are,
letting another one loose.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.805
Well, who better to catch
a Critch than a Critch, right?

07:51.805 --> 07:53.390
You said it.

07:53.390 --> 07:56.101
Look, Philo,
you were the best of us.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.145
Best inspector we had.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.981
We don't know where or when
the Sparas will strike next.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.734
- Or who.
- But if anyone can
find it and stop it...

08:03.734 --> 08:06.069
One of your lot is bound
to know something.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.488
What about that little Pix tart
of yours? Stonemoss.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.866
Find her.
Find out what she knows.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.411
The bloody hell's going on
out there?

08:14.411 --> 08:15.996
Another
chancellor dead.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.332
They'll be coming
for the rest of us soon, lads.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.257
I don't have time
for this shit.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.675
Hey!

08:28.675 --> 08:30.219
What the bloody hell's
going on here?

08:30.219 --> 08:32.554
Burn the Row!
Burn the Row!

08:32.554 --> 08:35.724
- Move back.
- Get in. Get in there!

08:35.724 --> 08:38.769
Go, go. Take them. Get to it!

08:47.486 --> 08:50.697
Something has got to be done.

08:50.697 --> 08:54.785
I don't want to see the Row
burn any more than you do.

08:54.785 --> 08:58.330
We've had our differences,
you and me,

08:58.330 --> 09:00.165
but the Raven would've killed me

09:00.165 --> 09:04.419
in front of my family that
night, and you stopped them.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.713
So if you...

09:14.471 --> 09:15.889
So if you'll just trust us...

09:17.891 --> 09:20.143
...we'll trust you.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.104
All right?

09:22.104 --> 09:23.897
What'd you reckon,
Philo?

09:27.401 --> 09:30.070
I always come through
for you lads, don't I?

09:48.672 --> 09:50.299
That's right,
my darling.

09:50.299 --> 09:52.342
Fruit and veg!

09:52.342 --> 09:54.428
- Best on the Row.
- It's rotten.

09:54.428 --> 09:55.929
I can't give my kids this muck.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.890
See if you can
get better elsewhere.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.809
Fruit and veg.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.895
Back from Bleakness?

10:03.895 --> 10:05.939
I see you picked up
a few souvenirs.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.108
Not compared to you.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.486
Yeah, well, I'm stronger.
And, uh, more handsome.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.947
So, why did they let you out?

10:13.947 --> 10:16.616
Somebody's got to catch
the chancellor's killer

10:16.616 --> 10:19.244
before the mob burns down
the Row, don't they?

10:19.244 --> 10:21.955
- It was a Sparas, by the way.
- Yeah, I heard.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.790
You think it wants to get even
after what we did

10:23.790 --> 10:26.043
- in Tirnanoc?
- I wouldn't be surprised,

10:26.043 --> 10:28.712
- would you?
- No, I... I suppose not.

10:28.712 --> 10:31.006
You know, when I was there,
I didn't give two hoots

10:31.006 --> 10:34.176
about killing a Critch,
and now I am one.

10:34.176 --> 10:36.011
You said it best.

10:36.011 --> 10:38.013
The world's not made
for people like us.

10:38.013 --> 10:40.015
Hey.

10:40.015 --> 10:42.934
- You all right?
- Yeah.

10:44.353 --> 10:47.189
I suppose I'm just seeing things
more clearly.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.942
You haven't seen Vignette,
have you?

10:50.942 --> 10:52.944
Yeah, she's safe.
Well, in one piece.

10:52.944 --> 10:54.154
Look, why don't you come inside?

10:54.154 --> 10:57.616
No. Nah.

10:58.742 --> 11:02.662
No, it's best if Vignette and I
keep away from each other.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.166
Well, right you are.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.001
But it's never
stopped you before.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.087
Just do us a favor.

11:10.087 --> 11:13.423
Tell her she was right.

11:13.423 --> 11:17.135
I picked the wrong side,
and I'm sorry.

11:17.135 --> 11:19.638
- Look, why don't you
tell her yourself?
- Just...

11:19.638 --> 11:21.515
Fucking tell her, all right?

11:22.974 --> 11:25.352
So you're just gonna walk off?

11:25.352 --> 11:28.980
Philo! Philo!

12:07.811 --> 12:09.604
Oh. This is nice, isn't it?

12:09.604 --> 12:11.982
- Cozy.
- It'll be fine.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.567
Trust me, I can handle this.

12:13.567 --> 12:16.695
Well, well, well!

12:16.695 --> 12:19.156
Miss Stonemoss.

12:19.156 --> 12:21.992
Strolling in
like you own the place.

12:21.992 --> 12:24.286
You've got some nerve.

12:27.956 --> 12:30.625
I'm looking to buy passage
out of the Burgue.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.169
Are you, now?

12:33.211 --> 12:36.131
Thing is, I don't find myself
particularly inclined

12:36.131 --> 12:39.843
to render my services
to those that cost me money.

12:39.843 --> 12:43.263
And, lately, you and your gang

12:43.263 --> 12:46.141
have cost me a lot of money.

12:46.141 --> 12:48.351
I'll pay up front!

12:49.811 --> 12:52.147
<i>I expect
you're in a bit of a hurry,</i>

12:52.147 --> 12:54.065
considering the bounty
on your head.

12:54.065 --> 12:55.233
Ah.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.860
Any ship'll do.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.403
Doesn't matter
where it's headed.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.155
- Can you get us out or not?
- Eh.

13:00.155 --> 13:01.740
Well, I could.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.867
Passage is pricey these days, though.

13:03.867 --> 13:06.870
Supply and demand.

13:07.871 --> 13:11.374
I'd like some idea
of what I'm getting myself into.

13:13.668 --> 13:16.796
What with you being
a wanted woman and all.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.177
If I knew you'd gone soft, Boz,

13:22.177 --> 13:23.762
I wouldn't have come to you
in the first place.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.972
Soft? Nah, just curious.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.600
There's all sorts of rumors
going around.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.268
They're saying
all those Black Raven

13:30.268 --> 13:33.104
that were locked up in Bleakness
have come home to make trouble.

13:33.104 --> 13:36.107
More than their usual trouble.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.610
Big plans, I heard.

13:38.610 --> 13:41.238
Hardly seems the time
for one of your lot to, uh,

13:41.238 --> 13:44.241
fly the nest, as it were.

13:44.241 --> 13:45.742
I wouldn't know.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.118
I left the Black Raven behind.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.578
Oh, yeah?

13:48.578 --> 13:50.705
You'll have no trouble there.

13:50.705 --> 13:52.749
Hmm. Good to know.

13:57.629 --> 13:59.130
Vignette?

13:59.130 --> 14:03.468
I take it you're no longer
under their protection then.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.387
Time was

14:05.387 --> 14:08.139
a businessman with good sense
would take the money

14:08.139 --> 14:09.474
and not ask questions.

14:09.474 --> 14:10.475
Mm.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.310
Times change, missy.

14:12.310 --> 14:13.853
There's a fat bounty
on your head,

14:13.853 --> 14:15.814
and without the Black Raven
to back you up, well...

14:17.148 --> 14:19.276
...you see my dilemma.

14:23.738 --> 14:26.199
If they touch
a hair on her head,

14:26.199 --> 14:27.492
you'll be pissing sideways.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.452
E-Easy now, love.

14:29.452 --> 14:32.789
Uh, no need to get overexcited.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.167
Let her go.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.252
Mm.

14:37.252 --> 14:38.587
Now.

14:38.587 --> 14:40.422
Go on!

14:45.969 --> 14:47.262
Move it!

14:47.262 --> 14:49.139
Shift it.

14:49.139 --> 14:50.849
Get out of the way.

14:52.183 --> 14:53.935
- Mm.
- We'll just be
on our way, then.

14:58.273 --> 15:00.817
Move! Move! Move!

15:00.817 --> 15:02.485
Sorry. Scuse me.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.405
Look out. Come this way.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.577
That went well.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.121
Okay, Boz is not
the only way out of the Burgue.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.707
If he's our best option, do I
really want to hear the others?

15:22.505 --> 15:24.591
- Mm.
- Can we really
go back to Tirnanoc?

15:24.591 --> 15:26.009
Oh.

15:26.009 --> 15:27.636
What's this, then?

15:30.555 --> 15:32.057
Hey.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.354
Vini, look.

15:38.605 --> 15:39.856
Tourmaline!

15:39.856 --> 15:41.358
What is it? What's happening?

15:41.358 --> 15:43.193
The Pact army is gone.

15:43.193 --> 15:44.819
- What do you mean?
- Word is

15:44.819 --> 15:47.072
they pulled their troops back
home to fight the New Dawn.

15:47.072 --> 15:48.865
Tirnanoc is free.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.619
I can't believe it.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.706
I can't believe it.

16:13.348 --> 16:21.940
Tirnanoc forever!

16:37.497 --> 16:38.915
Watch it!

16:55.890 --> 16:57.559
Give us the money.

17:44.606 --> 17:45.857
Come on.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.195
Come on. Finish it, you cunts.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.493
All right.

18:41.746 --> 18:44.082
Do you want another go?

18:44.082 --> 18:45.458
Fuck off!

18:47.252 --> 18:49.045
Here.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.760
Hair of the dog?

18:59.472 --> 19:02.016
Do you remember
when you did that to me?

19:02.016 --> 19:05.895
When we found that shitty
little pub... Where was that?

19:05.895 --> 19:08.022
Who the fuck cares?

19:08.022 --> 19:10.275
Well, you're a fucking
bundle of joy, ain't ya?

19:10.275 --> 19:11.818
Oh, I'm fine.

19:14.445 --> 19:16.072
So...

19:16.072 --> 19:19.158
what was that I dragged
out of the alley, then?

19:22.912 --> 19:24.581
I'm just gettin' my own back.

19:25.623 --> 19:27.792
You didn't let me die
in Bleakness, after all.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.882
It's all been a fucking lie.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.638
And the worst part is...

19:46.519 --> 19:48.771
...I managed to fool myself.

19:48.771 --> 19:51.608
That locking up criminals

19:51.608 --> 19:53.860
somehow made me...

19:56.446 --> 19:58.364
One of the good ones?

19:59.824 --> 20:01.576
For a cop.

20:01.576 --> 20:03.536
Passing as a human.

20:05.872 --> 20:09.292
Helping them
lock up the Critch...

20:09.292 --> 20:11.044
like me.

20:12.295 --> 20:15.465
They were criminals.

20:15.465 --> 20:18.885
Scumbags are scumbags.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.137
Yeah.

20:21.137 --> 20:24.349
But the human scum...

20:24.349 --> 20:27.060
they get to walk away scot-free.

20:28.895 --> 20:32.273
It's the ones like us they...

20:32.273 --> 20:34.567
swing from the gallows.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.862
Yeah, but you can't
do anything about that.

20:39.364 --> 20:41.824
It's not your fault.

20:41.824 --> 20:43.868
It's the way of the world.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.662
The system's fucked.

20:45.662 --> 20:47.205
But I knew it!

20:47.205 --> 20:48.957
And I went along with it!

20:50.500 --> 20:53.586
Gettin' strung up
from your heels...

20:53.586 --> 20:56.005
that'll make you see it.

20:56.005 --> 20:58.841
Nah.

20:58.841 --> 21:01.719
You were trying
to keep people safe.

21:01.719 --> 21:03.763
Including yourself.

21:03.763 --> 21:07.058
And that's not fucking nothing.

21:07.058 --> 21:10.728
This is just Bleakness
messing with your head, mate.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.480
- You're not listening to me.
- I am!

21:12.480 --> 21:14.649
But I know my friend,

21:14.649 --> 21:16.359
and I'm not buying into this

21:16.359 --> 21:19.612
"my whole life
is a lie" bollocks.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.698
Nice try, though.

21:23.700 --> 21:24.909
Maybe you'll have
better luck with her.

21:24.909 --> 21:26.786
Is he here?

21:26.786 --> 21:28.621
Oh, you didn't.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.207
He's all yours.
Have fun.

22:09.787 --> 22:12.373
Sounds like you had
quite a day.

22:12.373 --> 22:14.417
Feel better for it?

22:15.418 --> 22:19.047
You should probably just stay
the fuck away from me.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.259
How did we get here?

22:25.553 --> 22:27.180
I don't know.

22:30.683 --> 22:34.270
I've always tried
to help the fae.

22:34.270 --> 22:37.815
I just couldn't help
the fae in me, I suppose.

22:37.815 --> 22:39.817
Maybe if I'd known that...

22:39.817 --> 22:42.945
part of myself a bit better, we
might've had a fighting chance.

22:47.366 --> 22:50.369
Hindsight's a beautiful thing.

22:52.288 --> 22:53.706
Oh, well.

23:00.171 --> 23:02.715
Tirnanoc's free.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.760
Tourmaline's in danger
and she needs me.

23:10.098 --> 23:13.184
She can't stay here, Philo.

23:13.184 --> 23:15.436
And neither can I.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.357
You're right.

23:25.655 --> 23:27.907
You should go.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.512
I know you won't,
but...

23:49.512 --> 23:52.807
just try and take care
of yourself.

24:15.496 --> 24:17.373
There he is.

24:17.373 --> 24:20.084
You find your old lady?

24:21.502 --> 24:24.881
She's not the only one
who was at Bleakness

24:24.881 --> 24:26.799
when the Sparas attacked.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.135
What happened to Millworthy?

24:29.135 --> 24:30.553
Millworthy?

24:30.553 --> 24:33.139
Pissing himself in a corner,
from what I heard.

24:33.139 --> 24:36.058
Yeah, but he saw it.
Didn't he?

24:37.643 --> 24:39.979
If he saw it transform,

24:39.979 --> 24:42.940
maybe he knows its human face.

24:42.940 --> 24:45.193
Well, if that's true,

24:45.193 --> 24:47.236
the Sparas must know his, too.

24:47.236 --> 24:50.239
Then your Mr. Millworthy
is a marked man, I reckon.

24:50.239 --> 24:51.782
Poor bastard.

24:51.782 --> 24:54.327
We'd best send some lads over
to look after him.

24:54.327 --> 24:57.914
We need to know what he saw.

24:57.914 --> 25:00.499
Let me see him.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.627
He trusts me.

25:02.627 --> 25:04.128
He'll talk to me.

25:05.713 --> 25:07.840
It's worth a try.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.057
Let him out.

25:16.057 --> 25:20.186
Berwick, you take some lads
just to be sure.

25:29.111 --> 25:31.906
You won't find Millworthy
in Balefire, though.

25:31.906 --> 25:33.866
Not today.

25:36.077 --> 25:39.330
The Martyr cast down the fae.

25:39.330 --> 25:42.375
And lo, it was decreed

25:42.375 --> 25:46.295
that their lives
should be lived in pain.

25:46.295 --> 25:50.967
They should never know
the ease of the Martyr's hand,

25:50.967 --> 25:55.388
nor be welcomed
into His kingdom.

25:55.388 --> 25:59.600
But in His mercy,
the Martyr commands us

25:59.600 --> 26:03.104
to forgive even the most
wretched of his creatures,

26:03.104 --> 26:04.897
to forgive the fae

26:04.897 --> 26:07.608
- who took
Chancellor Breakspear from us.
- Merciful Martyr.

26:07.608 --> 26:10.820
That bloody priest had better
run out of hot air soon.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.530
- He won't.
- We cannot
condemn the fae

26:12.530 --> 26:14.031
- for their nature...
- They never do.

26:14.031 --> 26:18.286
...for they were born in sin.

26:18.286 --> 26:22.039
We shall purify ourselves
of sin,

26:22.039 --> 26:25.334
and cleanse our lands
of corruption

26:25.334 --> 26:27.253
with the Martyr's
blessed flame...

26:27.253 --> 26:29.380
If the Pact have quit Tirnanoc,

26:29.380 --> 26:32.466
their losses must be extensive.

26:32.466 --> 26:35.970
- The Martyr has
taught us...
- Quite right.

26:37.638 --> 26:40.308
Which means the New
Dawn has them on the back foot.

26:40.308 --> 26:43.269
An opportunity, surely.

26:44.770 --> 26:47.648
...beyond the reach
of His blessed light,

26:47.648 --> 26:50.234
beyond the reach
of the Martyr's hand.

26:50.234 --> 26:52.361
Hear, hear!

26:54.113 --> 26:56.615
Today,
in our remembrance

26:56.615 --> 26:58.326
of Chancellor Breakspear,

26:58.326 --> 27:02.330
we seek solace
that his name and memory

27:02.330 --> 27:04.415
will cross future generations.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.843
- Philo, you're safe.
- Safe enough.

27:15.843 --> 27:18.012
- You got your old job back?
- Yeah, something like that.

27:18.012 --> 27:21.057
Parliament's split,
so I'm a rare neutral party,

27:21.057 --> 27:23.017
which makes me useful for now.

27:23.017 --> 27:24.393
What are those constables doing?

27:24.393 --> 27:25.895
They think I'm asking you
about the Sparas.

27:25.895 --> 27:27.438
You're not?

27:27.438 --> 27:30.399
I need you to arrange
passage to Tirnanoc.

27:30.399 --> 27:31.692
Tirnanoc? You're go...

27:31.692 --> 27:33.694
Ah. Vignette.

27:33.694 --> 27:36.947
These people, they're so
terrified of the faefolk

27:36.947 --> 27:39.450
that trying to arrange
a passage for a single Pix,

27:39.450 --> 27:42.078
- let alone a criminal
who's, uh...
- Not just one Pix.

27:42.078 --> 27:44.288
All the fae.

27:44.288 --> 27:46.957
All the fae?

27:48.125 --> 27:49.585
It would solve
everyone's problems.

27:49.585 --> 27:52.463
Mass deportation;
that's a very ugly idea, Philo.

27:52.463 --> 27:54.340
It's better than burning alive.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.966
Believe me,
I understand the danger,

27:55.966 --> 27:57.843
but they're never going
to open the Row.

27:57.843 --> 27:59.428
They want rid of us.

27:59.428 --> 28:01.180
Parliament want
a thousand things,

28:01.180 --> 28:02.390
all of them contradictory.

28:02.390 --> 28:03.849
It's hard enough
to get them to agree

28:03.849 --> 28:05.810
on even the simplest matters.

28:05.810 --> 28:08.646
Shipping all the fae
to Tirnanoc is not simple.

28:08.646 --> 28:11.649
Then make it simple.
One ship, maybe two.

28:11.649 --> 28:14.235
Those clippers in the port, the
ones that used to make the run.

28:14.235 --> 28:16.654
When people see
the government taking action...

28:16.654 --> 28:18.572
Yeah, they'll begin
to cheer and...

28:18.572 --> 28:20.866
yeah, maybe the Parliament will
get another ship.

28:20.866 --> 28:24.036
When people see that, then...

28:24.036 --> 28:27.665
Could work. Might just work.

28:27.665 --> 28:29.458
You could get on one.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.711
Ah, I would like that, but...
I'm needed here.

28:32.711 --> 28:35.631
I could get on
the last ship, join you there.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.925
I'm not going.

28:39.218 --> 28:42.513
I wouldn't know
how to live there.

28:42.513 --> 28:44.640
Not as a Pix.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.727
Philo, you should try
living as yourself.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.230
Your mother's people,
Aisling's people,

28:51.230 --> 28:53.816
are from Tirnanoc.

28:53.816 --> 28:55.943
You could go home.

28:55.943 --> 28:58.070
To them.

29:05.286 --> 29:08.497
What do you mean,
they're letting us sail home?

29:09.790 --> 29:12.835
Any fae who wants
passage to Tirnanoc.

29:12.835 --> 29:15.588
There's two ships now;
there'll be more to follow.

29:15.588 --> 29:17.423
Just like that?

29:17.423 --> 29:19.133
The humans are helping us

29:19.133 --> 29:21.093
out of the kindness
of their own hearts?

29:21.093 --> 29:23.929
They want us gone;
we want to go.

29:27.641 --> 29:30.603
You said "we."

29:30.603 --> 29:32.354
Does that mean you're coming?

29:32.354 --> 29:33.689
Me?

29:33.689 --> 29:35.107
No.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.776
But it's a safer way out
for both of you.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.737
Better than trying
to sneak off the Row.

29:39.737 --> 29:43.115
And I was thinking you should
probably take the sick

29:43.115 --> 29:45.117
with you on the first ships.

29:45.117 --> 29:48.996
It's the filth of this place
that's killing them.

29:51.874 --> 29:53.083
That's...

29:53.083 --> 29:55.920
It's brilliant. It's brilliant.

29:58.214 --> 30:00.674
I'll speak to Afissa at the
clinic and make arrangements.

30:00.674 --> 30:02.218
Good.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.347
- I'll let you get on.
- Uh, Philo...

30:07.640 --> 30:10.184
Thank you.

30:18.067 --> 30:20.361
Well, Millworthy
pulled the strings, so...

30:20.361 --> 30:22.821
Yeah, but you
asked him to, so thank you.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.573
Yeah.

30:24.573 --> 30:25.866
Thank you.

30:27.743 --> 30:28.744
All right.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.512
<i>Visions.
Honestly.</i>

30:46.512 --> 30:48.764
What do Mimas know, anyway?

30:52.768 --> 30:54.895
Oh, for the love of...

30:54.895 --> 30:57.064
Go on. Go after him.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.484
We both said our piece.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.740
And I'm leaving with you.

31:06.740 --> 31:09.493
That man just saved
all our lives.

31:09.493 --> 31:12.788
And Vini... [laughs] We're Pix.

31:12.788 --> 31:14.999
There's room enough
in your heart.

31:14.999 --> 31:16.959
I know there is.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.569
The Row deserves a knees-up.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.615
I can't believe
I'm getting out of here.

31:49.533 --> 31:51.076
Yeah.

31:51.076 --> 31:52.911
It's gonna be strange
without ya.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.622
Aw.

31:54.622 --> 31:56.373
Are you gonna miss me?

31:56.373 --> 31:57.750
Yes, I am.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.712
It was nice having the company.

32:01.712 --> 32:03.380
Yeah, it was.

32:07.968 --> 32:10.554
You're very special,
you know, Ms. Larou.

32:10.554 --> 32:12.640
Anyone ever told you that?

32:15.225 --> 32:17.102
You could come with us,
you know.

32:17.102 --> 32:19.229
You could start a new life
if you wanted to.

32:19.229 --> 32:20.898
Me?

32:20.898 --> 32:22.608
On a ship?

32:22.608 --> 32:25.653
200 Fae would get on,

32:25.653 --> 32:27.321
and one Marrok would get off.

32:27.321 --> 32:29.031
No, look, I'm serious.

32:29.031 --> 32:30.532
We'll be there
before the full moon,

32:30.532 --> 32:32.660
and we could keep you away
from anything sharp.

32:37.706 --> 32:39.583
Thank you.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.420
But no.

32:45.339 --> 32:47.758
There's too many ghosts
in Tirnanoc.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.930
And the Burgue's
a shithole, but...

32:52.930 --> 32:54.890
but it's my home.

32:54.890 --> 32:57.309
It really is a shithole.

33:00.521 --> 33:03.148
Yeah, it is.

33:09.613 --> 33:11.615
Well...

33:14.118 --> 33:16.120
I'm gonna miss you, Mr. Prowell.

33:46.233 --> 33:47.735
Chin up, love.

33:47.735 --> 33:49.611
Bit of sea air

33:49.611 --> 33:51.321
and the sight of home,

33:51.321 --> 33:53.407
you'll be better in no time.

33:53.407 --> 33:55.033
She's right.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.911
We have everything we need
to rebuild in Tirnanoc.

33:57.911 --> 34:00.247
You'll see.

34:09.631 --> 34:13.135
I'll be glad when we finally
close the doors on this place.

34:14.803 --> 34:18.098
It was all I could do to keep
a smile on me face for them.

34:18.098 --> 34:21.018
You know, there were some days
when I wished I'd come down

34:21.018 --> 34:23.854
with the sickness,
and be done with it all.

34:23.854 --> 34:25.481
Oh.

34:25.481 --> 34:27.566
Will you stay in Tirnanoc, then?

34:28.567 --> 34:30.527
I don't know.

34:30.527 --> 34:32.654
Most of the faun are talking
about going home

34:32.654 --> 34:34.823
to Puyon, but...

34:34.823 --> 34:37.034
I was born here.

34:37.034 --> 34:39.119
The Burgue's all I know.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.207
I mean, not that it's been
an easy life, but...

34:43.207 --> 34:45.250
it's my life.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.878
I mean, what would I do
anywhere else?

34:47.878 --> 34:50.088
You were good to me
when I first came here.

34:51.340 --> 34:53.300
That's not true at all.

34:54.885 --> 34:58.222
I should've apologized long ago
for the way I spoke to you then.

34:58.222 --> 35:00.933
It was foolish.

35:03.477 --> 35:05.604
I'm ashamed.

35:06.647 --> 35:07.981
It doesn't matter now.

35:07.981 --> 35:09.316
It does.

35:09.316 --> 35:11.443
It does matter.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.738
But it was the way
I was brought up, you know?

35:14.738 --> 35:16.782
No time for kindness.

35:16.782 --> 35:19.618
No time for questions,
just work hard

35:19.618 --> 35:21.203
for your betters
and keep your head down

35:21.203 --> 35:22.871
if you know what's good for you.

35:22.871 --> 35:25.541
But people can do better.

35:25.541 --> 35:27.960
I can do better.

35:29.878 --> 35:31.713
Those ships,

35:31.713 --> 35:34.132
they're a blessing, Vignette.
Thank you.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.385
- It wasn't really me.
- Yes, well,

35:36.385 --> 35:39.680
when you see whoever it was,
give them a kiss from me.

35:42.766 --> 35:44.893
Now...

35:44.893 --> 35:47.688
they'll be looking
for escaped prisoners.

35:47.688 --> 35:50.607
So you'll come in as one of us.

35:55.904 --> 35:58.240
They won't look at you twice.

36:12.462 --> 36:14.172
Hello.

36:15.716 --> 36:17.342
Uh, thanks for this,
but I don't need it.

36:17.342 --> 36:18.552
Not now.

36:18.552 --> 36:20.470
You're leaving?

36:20.470 --> 36:22.097
Can you believe it?

36:26.894 --> 36:28.937
Maybe you were wrong.

36:28.937 --> 36:31.148
Maybe the Sight does lie.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.109
Perhaps.

36:53.503 --> 36:56.131
Never fancied going
to Tirnanoc before.

36:57.674 --> 37:00.135
Can't stand the fucking Pix.

37:00.135 --> 37:02.095
It's their land.

37:02.095 --> 37:03.805
They're doing us a favor.

37:03.805 --> 37:05.474
But if you want
to whinge and moan about it,

37:05.474 --> 37:07.976
I'm sure they'll be happy
to leave you behind.

37:20.697 --> 37:22.783
Don't worry,
you're gonna love it.

37:22.783 --> 37:24.785
Tirnanoc?

37:24.785 --> 37:26.870
It's the loveliest land
there is.

37:26.870 --> 37:29.122
And you'll never have
to bind your wings.

37:29.122 --> 37:31.875
I can fly... anytime I like?

37:31.875 --> 37:33.961
All day if you like.

37:50.352 --> 37:52.145
Right.

37:52.145 --> 37:53.855
Two rules.

37:53.855 --> 37:56.733
Shut your faces, stay in line.

37:56.733 --> 37:58.443
Muck about,

37:58.443 --> 38:00.862
and you'll find yourself
on the wrong end of a rifle.

38:00.862 --> 38:03.407
And for the winged Critch,

38:03.407 --> 38:07.035
don't even think
about trying to fly off.

38:07.035 --> 38:09.955
Do it, and it'll be
a bloody short flight,

38:09.955 --> 38:11.957
I promise you.

38:11.957 --> 38:14.793
Open these bastard gates, boys.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.129
All right!
Let 'em out!

38:28.015 --> 38:29.683
Fresh start.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.817
♪ ♪

39:03.800 --> 39:05.969
Afissa!

39:05.969 --> 39:07.471
I'll only be a minute.

39:07.471 --> 39:08.972
What? We haven't got time!

39:08.972 --> 39:11.058
Vignette!

39:24.112 --> 39:25.655
I didn't know
if I'd get a chance to say...

39:25.655 --> 39:28.116
Come with us.

39:28.116 --> 39:30.660
- What?
- To Tirnanoc.

39:35.957 --> 39:38.627
- Vignette...
- I know you did this for me.

39:39.711 --> 39:42.172
I couldn't say so before.
It was all happening so fast.

39:43.423 --> 39:44.883
But you can start again there.

39:44.883 --> 39:47.928
With me or without me,
whatever you want.

39:47.928 --> 39:49.471
Just come.

39:49.471 --> 39:51.264
Come to Tirnanoc.

39:58.897 --> 40:01.108
Please.

40:11.368 --> 40:13.995
Don't mind them.
It'll be okay.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.872
Come here. Hold on tight.

40:19.459 --> 40:22.295
You are an abomination!

40:22.295 --> 40:24.422
Get out of my fucking town!

40:24.422 --> 40:27.175
You hear me, Critch?
Get out of here!

40:35.851 --> 40:38.228
Go back
where you come from!

40:39.229 --> 40:40.689
Fucking get out of here!

40:51.616 --> 40:53.618
Filthy Critch!
Murderous vermin!

40:53.618 --> 40:57.289
Filthy Critch! Murderous vermin!
Filthy Critch! Murderous vermin!

40:57.289 --> 40:59.791
Filthy Critch! Murderous vermin!

41:18.393 --> 41:21.146
Keep moving, come on,
keep moving.

41:21.146 --> 41:23.607
Unload those wagons.

41:23.607 --> 41:25.150
Oi!

41:25.150 --> 41:27.652
You were never gonna go
after the Sparas, were you?

41:27.652 --> 41:29.529
No, I wasn't.

41:29.529 --> 41:31.156
I trusted you.

41:31.156 --> 41:32.574
We trusted each other, Philo.

41:32.574 --> 41:34.492
We were partners.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.411
You're a good man, Berwick.
Too good for that uniform.

41:36.411 --> 41:38.079
Oi, don't say that.

41:38.079 --> 41:39.539
Don't say that, all right?

41:39.539 --> 41:41.833
Look, I-I'm not stupid.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.668
I know what the lads are like.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.003
But me and you?

41:45.003 --> 41:46.671
We're decent.

41:46.671 --> 41:49.049
We make the uniform better.

41:49.049 --> 41:51.176
That's the point.

41:51.176 --> 41:53.637
I put it on every morning.

41:53.637 --> 41:55.472
Just like you did.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.475
Just like my dad did.

41:58.475 --> 42:01.770
And I'm proud to be cut
from the same cloth as you both.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.815
I didn't abandon the badge.

42:05.815 --> 42:08.235
It was stripped from me.

42:09.361 --> 42:11.363
And I'm glad of it.

42:52.821 --> 42:54.406
No!

42:58.410 --> 43:00.370
It's
the Black Ravens!

43:24.644 --> 43:26.396
Shut the gate!
Shut it!

43:26.396 --> 43:28.023
Philo!

43:28.023 --> 43:30.066
What are you doing?

43:30.066 --> 43:32.444
You! Go, just get out!

43:32.444 --> 43:34.529
- No! Philo!
- Get back,
get back!

43:38.450 --> 43:40.785
Take 'em down!
Target at will!

44:48.103 --> 44:49.813
Quickly! Go!

44:49.813 --> 44:52.148
Stay in line.

44:52.148 --> 44:54.359
Please. You know the rules.

44:54.359 --> 44:56.569
Don't even think about it.
Don't fucking...

44:56.569 --> 44:58.530
It's a Sparas!

44:58.530 --> 45:01.032
- Hey, grab her!
- Where do you think
you're going?

45:01.032 --> 45:02.700
Hey!
Get that fucking Critch!

45:02.700 --> 45:04.619
This is a warning!

45:04.619 --> 45:07.330
Stay on
the fucking ground!

45:07.330 --> 45:09.916
Don't fly anywhere!

45:09.916 --> 45:12.001
Shoot
the lot of you!

45:13.503 --> 45:15.880
Where the fuck
are you going? Get back!

45:15.880 --> 45:18.299
You'll take flight
when you're dead!

45:24.305 --> 45:26.558
This isn't
how it happens.

45:26.558 --> 45:28.601
It doesn't kill me here.

45:28.601 --> 45:30.603
- Keep it moving.
- Get back!

45:37.318 --> 45:40.280
Lads, I need some help!

45:40.280 --> 45:42.115
Get over here now!
You're gonna be all right.

45:42.115 --> 45:44.534
Okay? I'm gonna get you up.
Lads, come on!

45:44.534 --> 45:46.953
Come on, let's get up.
One, two, three.

45:46.953 --> 45:49.038
Come on.

45:53.960 --> 45:55.753
Stop.

45:55.753 --> 45:58.339
Put it down now.

45:59.340 --> 46:01.718
Turn around. Turn around!

46:06.306 --> 46:09.142
Put it down now.

46:09.142 --> 46:12.187
Walk toward me.

46:39.047 --> 46:41.132
Berwick!

47:39.482 --> 47:42.193
Philo, come on.

47:49.617 --> 47:52.745
We have to go now.
