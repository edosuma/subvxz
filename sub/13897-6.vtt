WOULD YOU HURRY UP? PLEASE?

00:06.590 --> 00:10.220
LISTEN, DO NOT BE STINGY
WITH THE DRESSING
AND GRAVY THIS TIME.

00:10.260 --> 00:14.050
OH, I AM INSULTED.
TRULY! THIS IS A
RESPECTABLE CHIP TRUCK,

00:14.090 --> 00:16.260
AND THE ACCUSATION
THAT I WOULD
MISREPRESENT THE QUANTITY

00:16.300 --> 00:19.560
OF POSTED PORTIONS
IS LUDICROUS,
MY FRIEND. LUDICROUS.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.230
-YEAH, I KNOW. YOU'RE
A PERSECUTED SOUL, ZIG.
-&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

00:22.270 --> 00:23.310
&lt;CELLPHONE RINGING&gt;

00:24.650 --> 00:25.900
[JAKE] WHAT, B'Y?
I'M ON MY WAY.

00:25.940 --> 00:27.440

00:27.480 --> 00:30.070
YEAH, LOOK. DON'T
WORRY. ALL RIGHT? I'LL GET
THE CHIPS AND THE FISH

00:30.110 --> 00:33.660
AND YOU CAN START
CLOGGING YOUR ARTERIES IN NO
TIME. BAG IT.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.410
GREAT CHEFS CANNOT
BE RUSHED, JAKE.
YOU KNOWS THAT, B'Y.

00:37.280 --> 00:38.280
[MALACHY] JAKE?

00:38.330 --> 00:39.540

00:42.160 --> 00:45.170
HEY! HOT COP!
HOW'RE YOU DOING?

00:45.210 --> 00:48.290
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC
TODAY, BY THE WAY

00:48.340 --> 00:51.670
ISN'T IT JUST SUCH GREAT
LUCK, YOU KNOW, RUNNING INTO
YOU ON SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY?

00:51.710 --> 00:53.010
I THINK FATE IS SHINING ON US.

00:53.050 --> 00:54.430
OH, YEAH, FATE, IS IT?

00:54.470 --> 00:57.260
I DON'T HAPPEN TO RETURN
YOUR SEVEN PHONE MESSAGES

00:57.300 --> 00:59.470
AND YOU JUST FIND ME
ON MY WAY TO A CALL.

00:59.510 --> 01:02.930
WELL, FATE, DESTINY,
SMALL TOWN, WHATEVER. YOU KNOW
IT ALL WORKS FOR ME.

01:02.980 --> 01:06.230
LISTEN JAKE, I'M NOT
IN THE MOOD, OKAY?
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:06.270 --> 01:09.150
I DON'T WANT NOTHING. I JUST
THOUGHT MAYBE, YOU KNOW,
WE COULD HAVE A LITTLE CHAT.

01:23.330 --> 01:25.870
I DON'T WANT
TO CHAT. GO AWAY.

01:25.920 --> 01:29.130
OKAY, WELL, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH TALKING? YOU KNOW?
TALKING'S GOOD.

01:29.170 --> 01:31.050
GO AWAY! SHOO!

01:31.920 --> 01:34.130
SHOO? DID YOU JUST SHOO ME?

01:34.170 --> 01:36.760
I'LL DO A LOT WORSE IF
YOU DON'T PACK OFF
AND LEAVE ME ALONE.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.680
&lt;MUFFLED YELLING&gt;

01:44.230 --> 01:46.730
OKAY, OBVIOUSLY RIGHT
NOW IS NOT THE MOST
OPPORTUNE TIME TO TALK,

01:46.770 --> 01:50.060
BUT HEY, HEY! WHAT ABOUT
LATER, YOU KNOW,
WE HOOK UP AFTER WORK

01:50.110 --> 01:52.280
AND HAVE A LITTLE,
UH, WHISKEY TASTING THING.

01:52.320 --> 01:55.200
JAKE, I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU'RE THE MOST OPTIMISTIC
PERSON ON THE PLANET

01:55.240 --> 01:58.570
OR IF YOU JUST SUFFERED
BRAIN DAMAGE IN THE SHOWER
THIS MORNING OR WHAT.

01:58.620 --> 02:02.120
GET IT THROUGH YOUR SKULL.
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

02:02.160 --> 02:05.710
LIAR. I THINK YOU HAVE
REAL FEELINGS FOR ME,

02:05.750 --> 02:09.670
SO WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THESE
FEELINGS TONIGHT, OVER DRINKS,
IN BED, WITH NO PANTS ON.

02:09.710 --> 02:12.710
OH, MY GOD, WOULD YOU GET
OVER YOURSELF? I DON'T WANT TO
SEE YOU NAKED, ALL RIGHT?

02:12.750 --> 02:17.880
OKAY. IF IT'LL HELP SEAL
THE DEAL, YOU TAKE YOUR PANTS
OFF, AND I'LL LEAVE MINE ON.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.260
OH, MY GOD.

02:22.220 --> 02:24.180
-WHAT?
-UH...

02:27.060 --> 02:31.400
I THINK WE HAVE A BIT OF
A SITUATION HERE.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.690
THAT'S A ROBBERY, JAKE.
WE GOTTA STOP THEM.

02:33.730 --> 02:35.360
-[LESLIE] STOP, POLICE!
-[JAKE] HEY!

02:36.240 --> 02:38.070
&lt;ENGINE STARTING&gt;

02:39.360 --> 02:40.660
OPEN THE DOOR!

02:50.670 --> 02:52.500
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

03:03.850 --> 03:05.180
WE CAN'T LET THEM INSIDE.

03:08.350 --> 03:09.600
THAT'S THE IDEA.

03:13.150 --> 03:15.190
NOW THIS IS WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

03:15.230 --> 03:16.650
OH, GOD, HELP ME.

03:16.690 --> 03:18.700
&lt;THEME MUSIC PLAYING&gt;

03:40.510 --> 03:44.760
IT'S LIKE THIS AMAZING
GATHERING OF PEOPLE WITH THIS
SPECIAL, SPECIAL SKILL SET.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.930
WHAT KIND OF SKILL SET?

03:46.970 --> 03:49.350
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU ASKED. IT'S
A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO
HAVE THE ABILITY TO PREDICT,

03:49.390 --> 03:52.480
WELL ACTUALLY, NO. DETERMINE
CERTAIN OUTCOMES IN THE NEAR
FUTURE,

03:52.520 --> 03:55.650
IN LIKE A,
A FAIR-TYPE SETTING.

03:55.690 --> 03:58.940
FAIR-TYPE SETTING? DES,
WHAT KIND OF FAIR IS THIS?

03:58.990 --> 04:01.490
UH, LIKE A,
LIKE A PSYCHIC FAIR.

04:01.530 --> 04:03.160
LIKE A PSYCHIC FAIR?

04:03.200 --> 04:05.370
OKAY, IT IS A PSYCHIC FAIR
BUT IT'S REALLY,
REALLY GOOD TIMES,

04:05.410 --> 04:08.750
AND IT'S ONLY IN TOWN
FOR THREE DAYS. THOUGHTS?
QUESTIONS? CONCERNS?

04:08.790 --> 04:13.420
UH, IT SOUNDS, UM,
IT SOUNDS GREAT,
BUT, UH, I CAN'T.

04:13.460 --> 04:15.590
OKAY. NO, TOTALLY. TOTALLY.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.960
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.
DES. NO, NO. IT'S NOT THAT. I
DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK...

04:19.010 --> 04:21.380
DES, I'M JUST...
I'M SUPER BUSY.

04:21.420 --> 04:23.050
&lt;INTERCOM VOICE SPEAKING&gt;

04:23.090 --> 04:24.720
I GOTTA GO. I'M SORRY.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.390
IT'S JUST THE LAST TIME I
WAS THERE, THEY SAID THERE'D
BE TROUBLE IN MY NEAR FUTURE,

04:27.430 --> 04:28.770
AND THE NEXT DAY I MET JAKE.

04:28.810 --> 04:32.310
WILD, WHA?
HELLO? HELLO? HELLO?

04:33.770 --> 04:35.360
IT'S OKAY DESSIE.
SHE LIKES YOU.

04:35.400 --> 04:39.400
YEAH, NO, YEAH. SHE'S CRAZY
ABOUT ME. THAT'S PROBABLY
WHY SHE HUNG UP ON ME.

04:39.440 --> 04:42.700
WHERE THE HELL IS JAKE?
SAYS HE'S COMING BACK WITH
SUPPER HALF AN HOUR AGO.

04:42.740 --> 04:46.030
YEAH, HE ONCE LEFT ME
OUTSIDE A STRIP CLUB HOLDING A
MAN'S BOOT FOR 12 TO 13 HOURS,

04:46.070 --> 04:48.120
AND THEN YELLED AT ME
FOR BEING LATE FOR WORK.

04:48.160 --> 04:51.370
HE PROBABLY JUST GOT
DISTRACTED. IT'S ONE
HAPPY HOUR. BIG DEAL.

04:51.410 --> 04:54.710
IT'S NOT JUST ANY HAPPY
HOUR! IT'S THE SECOND
FRIDAY OF THE MONTH!

04:54.750 --> 04:57.590
HALF-PRICED WHISKEY TASTING.
I'LL CHECK THE HOSPITALS.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.500
I'LL CALL OPEN LINE AND
PUT OUT A MISSING PERSONS.

04:59.550 --> 05:01.710
I'LL PICK UP THE FOOD
MYSELF. DES, COME WITH ME.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.050
-&lt;CELLPHONE RINGING&gt;
-OH.

05:06.010 --> 05:07.510
HEY, TINNY. WHAT'S UP?

05:07.550 --> 05:09.510
WHERE'S UNCLE JAKE?

05:09.560 --> 05:11.180
I'M JUST TRYING TO TRACK
HIM DOWN RIGHT NOW.

05:11.220 --> 05:12.270
[KATHLEEN] I SAID GET OUT!

05:12.310 --> 05:13.980
[ERIC] YOU KNOW
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

05:14.020 --> 05:15.140
&lt;COMMOTION&gt;

05:15.190 --> 05:16.310
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

05:16.350 --> 05:18.020
MOM'S KIND OF
FREAKING OUT AT ERIC.

05:18.060 --> 05:19.270
ARE YOU TWO OKAY?

05:19.320 --> 05:22.530
I'M FINE. I'M MORE
WORRIED FOR HIM THAN FOR HER.

05:22.570 --> 05:24.030
OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.500
WE'RE IN SOME
KIND OF WAREHOUSE.

05:40.550 --> 05:42.380
THEY'RE GOING TO
COME IN AFTER US, AND WE
KNOW THAT THEY'RE ARMED.

05:46.220 --> 05:47.430
BUDDY JUST LEFT THE CAB.

05:49.260 --> 05:50.640
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:50.680 --> 05:52.270
WHAT? WE GOTTA
GET THE JUMP ON THEM.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.520
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE
ARE OR HOW MANY PEOPLE
HE'S GOT OUT THERE.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.600
I'M PRETTY SURE THERE'S
TWO OF THEM, OKAY?

05:56.640 --> 05:58.400
AND YOU LEFT ONE OF THEM
BACK THERE ON THE ROAD,

05:58.440 --> 06:01.690
WHICH WAS VERY, VERY
ATTRACTIVE, HOW YOU HANDLED
THAT, BY THE WAY.

06:01.730 --> 06:04.030
-OH, MY GOD, JAKE.
-WELL, I'M JUST SAYING.

06:08.280 --> 06:11.450
OH, YEAH, THE BATTERY'S DEAD.
I WONDER WHY WITH HOW MUCH
YOU'VE BEEN CALLING IT.

06:12.910 --> 06:14.500
-I GOT NO SIGNAL NEITHER.
-&lt;BANGING&gt;

06:14.540 --> 06:16.330
WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:16.370 --> 06:19.500
IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE
SMASHING AT THE LOCK WITH
A FRIGGIN' CROWBAR.

06:19.540 --> 06:23.880
[MALE ROBBER] COME ON OUT
AND YOU WON'T GET HURT. WE
JUST WANT ONE OF THE BOXES.

06:23.920 --> 06:28.010
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YOU
SEEM LIKE REALLY NICE FOLKS,
SO I'LL GET RIGHT ON THAT.

06:28.050 --> 06:29.590
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING SPECIFIC.

06:31.050 --> 06:32.350
THEY LEFT THIS BEHIND.

06:32.390 --> 06:33.510
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

06:33.560 --> 06:35.350
LOOKS LIKE A KEY FOR ONE
OF THOSE LOCK BOXES.

06:36.980 --> 06:39.650
IF WE CAN FIND WHAT IT IS
THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR...

06:39.690 --> 06:41.400
WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING
TO BARGAIN WITH. START TRYING.

06:48.570 --> 06:51.740
YOUR SON IS A DOUCHE.
AND I HOPE YOU KNOW IT'S
NOT EASY FOR ME TO SAY SO.

06:51.780 --> 06:53.200
HE ORDERED THE FOOD,
AND THEN WHAT?

06:53.240 --> 06:55.450
OH, HE BOOTED IT AFTER
THE BLONDE COP HE'S
GOT NO CHANCE WITH.

06:55.490 --> 06:57.870
SO HE WAS WITH LESLIE.
WHICH WAY DID THEY GO?

06:57.910 --> 07:00.210
$39.95, AND I'LL
GIVE YOU A HINT.

07:00.250 --> 07:01.880
-40 BUCKS?
-WHAT A RIP!

07:01.920 --> 07:05.340
HEY, THE FOOD
WAS 23 EVEN, PLUS
10 BUCKS FOR STORAGE,

07:05.380 --> 07:08.670
AND AN AUTOMATIC 20 PERCENT
GRATUITY FOR THE TROUBLE.
I'VE GOTS TO LIVE, MALACHY.

07:09.590 --> 07:12.470
AH, HA, HA. ALL RIGHT.

07:12.510 --> 07:15.560
HE CHASED HER
DOWN FRESHWATER, LIKE THE
PATHETIC FOOL HE IS.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.140
OH, DON'T TELL
HIM I SAID THAT.

07:18.810 --> 07:20.600
-[CUSTOMER] TWO LARGE
FRIES, PLEASE?
-[ZIGGY] TWO?

07:20.650 --> 07:22.980
THERE'S JAKE'S CAR,
AND LESLIE'S.

07:23.020 --> 07:24.690
YEAH, YEAH, BUT ZIGGY SAYS
THEY WENT THE OTHER WAY.

07:29.740 --> 07:33.450
IT JUST ISN'T WORKING,
OKAY? I GOT ENOUGH
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

07:33.490 --> 07:34.620
YOU JUST HAVE TO GO.

07:34.660 --> 07:36.660
NO. I'M NOT GOING.
I'M NOT LEAVING...

07:38.080 --> 07:40.120
NOW, NOW, NOW,
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

07:40.160 --> 07:41.830
HEY! SOMEBODY WANT TO
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

07:41.870 --> 07:44.750
ROSE, I'M SORRY,
OKAY? BUT ERIC'S GOTTA GO.

07:44.790 --> 07:45.960
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.590
OKAY, EVERYBODY JUST
TAKE A DEEP BREATH, OKAY?

07:48.630 --> 07:50.220
SOMEBODY TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

07:50.260 --> 07:54.050
OKAY, SHE JUST DECIDES
THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO SEE ME ALL OF A SUDDEN,

07:54.100 --> 07:56.600
SO NOW I'VE JUST
GOTTA LEAVE JUST LIKE THAT.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.430
ERIC, STOP TALKING NOW
BEFORE I LOSE MY PATIENCE.

07:59.480 --> 08:00.560
COME ON, NAW.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.350
-ERIC, STOP. ERIC.
-&lt;MUMBLING&gt;

08:03.400 --> 08:04.810
-HEY, KATH, DO YOU
NEED A HAND HERE?
-YEAH.

08:04.850 --> 08:07.070
WHAT YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND IS THAT
I LOVE HER. I LOVE HER!

08:08.990 --> 08:11.240
-OKAY, I AM OUTTA HERE.
-TINNY!

08:12.070 --> 08:13.860
ERIC, LISTEN TO ME.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.490
YOU CAN'T COME
BACK HERE, OR THERE'S
GOING TO BE SOME TROUBLE.

08:16.530 --> 08:19.700
THE THING IS THAT, UM, I
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.620
I DON'T CARE. THAT'S
IRRELEVANT INFORMATION.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.670
GO HOME.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.550
GO!

08:36.800 --> 08:37.680
&lt;GROANING&gt;

08:39.810 --> 08:42.730
SO, KATH, WHAT THE HECK
WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

08:42.770 --> 08:45.560
I KNOW, BUT IT'S A
LONG, LONG STORY. IT HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH ERIC.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.480
HE WAS JUST BEING TOO DRUNK
AND TOO CLINGY. HE HAD TO GO.

08:48.520 --> 08:49.610
OBVIOUSLY.

08:50.610 --> 08:52.320
THE REAL PROBLEM IS
MUCH, MUCH WORSE.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.490
YOU WANT TO TELL ME ABOUT IT?

08:57.030 --> 08:58.080
DID YOU TRY THE OTHER ONE?

08:58.120 --> 08:59.620
&lt;BANGING&gt;

08:59.660 --> 09:02.750
DO YOU WANT A DIFFERENT
ANSWER FROM THE LAST 14
TIMES THAT YOU ASKED ME THAT?

09:02.790 --> 09:05.750
JAKE, YOU DON'T
NEED TO BE A TOOL.

09:05.790 --> 09:09.460
B'YS! WOULD YOU GIVE
IT A REST FOR JUST
FIVE SECONDS PLEASE?

09:12.300 --> 09:13.840
WELL, IT'S NICE
OF THEM TO OBLIGE.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.720
[FEMALE ROBBER] YOU LEFT ME
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.
ARE YOU AN IDIOT?

09:16.760 --> 09:18.260
[MALE ROBBER] WELL, YOU KNEW
WHERE YOU WERE GOING.

09:18.300 --> 09:21.180
AND STOP CALLING ME
AN IDIOT. SERIOUSLY.

09:21.220 --> 09:23.770
THERE'S DEFINITELY TWO
OF THEM. AND THEY'RE FIGHTING.

09:24.690 --> 09:26.400
WE GOTTA FIND
A WAY OUT OF HERE.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.770
THEY MUST BE A COUPLE.

09:27.810 --> 09:30.480
YOU'RE SO CYNICAL.
GIVE ME THE KEY.

09:30.520 --> 09:31.980
-WHAT?
-GIVE IT TO ME.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.280
SUIT YOURSELF.

09:35.280 --> 09:39.830
[FEMALE ROBBER] LEAVE YOUR
MASK ON, IDIOT.
I MEAN... I MEAN, IDIOT!

09:39.870 --> 09:41.790
[MALE ROBBER] YOU KNOW
THAT WORD MESSES
WITH MY CONFIDENCE.

09:41.830 --> 09:44.080
I TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE.

09:44.120 --> 09:45.830
[FEMALE ROBBER]OKAY,
JUST KEEP YOUR COOL.

09:45.870 --> 09:48.630
WE NEED TO GET
THEM OUT, AND NOW!

09:48.670 --> 09:51.800
SOMETHING IN ONE OF
THESE BOXES IS WORTH
AN AWFUL LOT TO THEM.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.380
WELL, LOOK AT YOU
WITH THE LUCKY TOUCH.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.930
YEAH, I'M TRAPPED
IN THE BACK OF AN
ARMORED VAN WITH YOU,

09:58.970 --> 10:00.180
AND YOU THINK I'M LUCKY?

10:03.680 --> 10:05.560
THIS IS WORTH SOMETHING.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.600
YEAH, YOU SHOULD TRY
SOME OF THAT ON.
IT'D LOOK GOOD ON YOU.

10:08.650 --> 10:11.610
-HEY, BELL-HEADS!
-&lt;ENGINE STARTING&gt;

10:11.650 --> 10:13.860
I THINK WE'VE GOT
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

10:13.900 --> 10:15.820
YEAH, RILE THEM UP,
WHY DON'T YOU?

10:31.170 --> 10:33.630
WE GOT A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

10:33.670 --> 10:35.550
-WHAT ARE YOU...
-YOU DON'T MIND, DO YOU?

10:40.640 --> 10:43.850
SO WHY WERE YOU MOVING
THE BOXES? WEREN'T
THEY SAFER INSIDE?

10:43.890 --> 10:45.600
YEAH, YOU'D THINK SO.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.890
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME
COMPLAINTS ABOUT ITEMS
GOING MISSING AND STUFF.

10:47.940 --> 10:50.770
CERTAIN CUSTOMERS WANTED THEIR
BELONGINGS MOVED, SO WE DID,

10:50.810 --> 10:54.070
AND, YOU KNOW, I GOT
TASERED FOR THE TROUBLE.

10:54.110 --> 10:55.900
MAYBE JAKE AND
LESLIE, THEY JUST

10:55.940 --> 10:58.530
PATCHED THINGS UP AND
JUST RAN AWAY TOGETHER.
THAT'D BE NICE, WOULDN'T IT?

10:58.570 --> 10:59.660
SOME REASON I DOUBT THAT.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.870
NO, BUT, JAKE'S GOT THIS
KIND OF, LIKE,

11:03.280 --> 11:06.370
MAGNETISM. IT'S ALMOST ANIMAL,
BUT WITH A LOT OF CLASS.

11:07.830 --> 11:11.670
SERGEANT HOOD. YOU DON'T
HAPPEN TO KNOW WHERE LESLIE
BENNETT'S TO?

11:11.710 --> 11:13.420

11:14.800 --> 11:17.170
MEANWHILE, IT'S LEFT
TO ME TO PICK UP THE
ARMORED VAN ROBBERY

11:17.210 --> 11:18.920
TWO BLOCKS FROM HER LAST CALL.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.630
DID ANYONE SEE ANYTHING?

11:20.680 --> 11:23.760
WHAT, I GOTTA REPORT

ASK THE WITNESS YOURSELF.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.430
-IF YOU DON'T MIND?
-FILL YOUR BOOTS.

11:25.470 --> 11:28.350
&lt;LAUGHING SARCASTICALLY&gt;

11:28.390 --> 11:31.350
YOU MIND TELLING ME WHAT
HAPPENED HERE? I THINK MY
SON MIGHT HAVE BEEN WITNESS.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.900
WELL, IT ALL HAPPENED
SO FAST, YOU KNOW?

11:32.940 --> 11:35.730
IT WAS A ROBBERY,
I WAS HURT, BUT I'LL LIVE.

11:37.940 --> 11:39.990
-&lt;CELLPHONE RINGING&gt;
-RIGHT ON.

11:40.030 --> 11:42.620
SO, UH, SO WHAT NOW?

11:42.660 --> 11:44.700
SEE IF YOU CAN GET ACCESS
TO THOSE SECURITY TAPES.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.000
ROSE? ANY WORD FROM JAKE?

11:48.040 --> 11:49.660
NO. NOT YET.

11:49.710 --> 11:52.040
WELL, CALL AROUND, WILL YOU?
I'M GONNA CHECK OUT
THE USUAL HAUNTS.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.670
MAL, ARE YOU
ACTUALLY GETTING WORRIED?

11:53.710 --> 11:55.840
I DON'T KNOW. SOMETHING
DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.
I'LL BUZZ YOU LATER.

11:56.590 --> 11:57.840
-DES.
-HMM?

11:57.880 --> 12:01.340

12:07.640 --> 12:12.560
OKAY. SO, BACK OUT WEST.

WHO WAS BOTHERING ME?

12:13.020 --> 12:14.310
OKAY. HE GOT FREAKY.

12:17.860 --> 12:19.860
WILL ANDREWS.

12:19.900 --> 12:23.660
WE WERE DATING,
AND THEN I FOUND OUT
THAT HE WAS MARRIED.

12:24.490 --> 12:26.370
I DUMPED HIM AND
HE DIDN'T TAKE IT WELL,

12:26.410 --> 12:29.250
SO I CAME BACK HOME
TO GET AWAY FROM HIM.

12:29.290 --> 12:32.500
IT'S OKAY, HONEY.
IT'S OKAY. RIGHT?

12:32.540 --> 12:34.380
JUST TELL ME WHAT
YOU WANT TO DO.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.800
MOM. SOMEBODY JUST
SLIPPED THIS UNDER THE DOOR.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.260

12:41.300 --> 12:44.590
"YOU WRECKED MY LIFE, YOU
TRAMP. I'M GETTING EVEN."

12:44.840 --> 12:46.100
YEAH.

12:47.970 --> 12:49.640
NOT COOL.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.810
WE'RE ONLY SLOWING IT DOWN.

12:56.860 --> 13:00.650
YOU'RE RIGHT, WE GOTTA

WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO, OKAY?

13:00.690 --> 13:03.320

THEN YOU FOLLOW ME.

13:05.070 --> 13:07.200
YEAH, I'M JUST GOING
TO HAND OVER MY
SERVICE WEAPON AND HIDE.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.990

13:09.030 --> 13:11.540
ALL RIGHT, FINE, FINE,
OKAY? PLAN B. ALL RIGHT,

13:11.580 --> 13:12.960

13:13.000 --> 13:15.920
AND THEN I'LL GO
GRAB THE KEYS
UNTIL YOU GET OUT.

13:15.960 --> 13:19.710
NO. I COVER YOU. YOU
HIDE UNTIL I COME
GET YOU. SIMPLE.

13:19.750 --> 13:22.920
ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER.
IF WE STAY IN HERE,
WE'RE GONNA DIE. WAIT.

13:26.510 --> 13:27.550
FOR LUCK.

13:28.050 --> 13:29.640
JAKE.

13:29.680 --> 13:32.350
PUT MY GUN BACK
IN THE HOLSTER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM?

13:33.020 --> 13:34.440
IT WAS WORTH A SHOT.

13:35.890 --> 13:37.610
LET'S GO.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.270
[MALE ROBBER] THIS IS
STARTING TO GET OUT OF HAND.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.440
[FEMALE ROBBER] STARTING TO
GET OUT OF HAND? LOOK,
THERE IS NO GOING BACK NOW.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.490
[MALE ROBBER] MY ARMS
HURT, AND I'M SWEATY.

13:44.530 --> 13:45.910
[FEMALE ROBBER]
WHY DO YOUR ARMS HURT?

13:45.950 --> 13:47.160
[MALE ROBBER]
I DON'T KNOW. I'M TIRED!

13:47.200 --> 13:48.410
[FEMALE ROBBER]
OH, FOR THE LOVE...

13:48.450 --> 13:51.910
IT'S JUST-- JUST A
LITTLE LONGER.
THEY WILL GIVE UP SOON.

13:56.540 --> 13:57.580
JAKE!

13:57.630 --> 13:58.830
[MALE ROBBER] WAIT!

14:00.250 --> 14:02.250

14:27.530 --> 14:29.030
WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN IN THERE!

14:29.070 --> 14:31.660
[MALE ROBBER] THAT'S IT! NO.
STOP CALLING ME AN IDIOT.
IT TEARS ME DOWN.

14:31.700 --> 14:32.790
TEARS ME DOWN!

14:36.040 --> 14:37.670
THAT WAS NOT THE PLAN.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.960
YEAH, WELL, THEY'RE NOT
GOING TO BE ABLE TO
SMOKE US OUT ANYMORE.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.420
-WHAT'S WRONG?
-NOTHING.

14:43.460 --> 14:46.050
WHAT ARE YOU BEING
SUCH A BABY ABOUT YOUR
SHOULDER FOR? LET ME SEE.

14:46.090 --> 14:47.800
-AH!
-JAKE, YOU'VE BEEN SHOT!

14:47.840 --> 14:49.390
NO, I HAVEN'T, NO, I HAVEN'T.

14:50.760 --> 14:53.140
-WE GOTTA STOP THE BLOOD.
-YEAH.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.730
I SHOULDA GOT
SHOT A LONG TIME AGO.

14:57.770 --> 14:59.140
DON'T GET ANY IDEAS.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.770
&lt;INHALES SHARPLY&gt;
AH! AH, AH.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.400
I THINK I'M GONNA
NEED A BIGGER BANDAGE.

15:05.440 --> 15:06.990
YOU BETTER TAKE OFF
YOUR PANTS, TOO.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.580
HOLD ON JAKE. HOLD ON.

15:20.210 --> 15:22.790
YOU KNOW, YOU
SHOULD POCKET THOSE.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.170
THEY REALLY WOULD
LOOK SPECTACULAR ON YOU.

15:25.210 --> 15:27.920
SHH. LIE QUIET.
YOU'RE BURNING UP.

15:29.050 --> 15:30.220
IS YOUR SHIRT STILL OFF?

15:32.640 --> 15:34.510
JAKE, BE GOOD.

15:40.730 --> 15:42.100
WHAT IS THAT NOISE?

15:43.730 --> 15:45.400
THE HAPPY COUPLE'S
GOT A NEW TOY.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.110
OH.

15:47.150 --> 15:48.990
JAKE, YOU'VE LOST
A LOT OF BLOOD.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.990
THAT'S A BLOW TORCH. THAT
MIGHT WORK, UNFORTUNATELY.

15:55.700 --> 15:58.000
GET BACK HERE, BUCKO.

15:58.040 --> 16:02.170
LOOK, IF WE DON'T GET
OUT OF HERE AND THEY
BURST THROUGH THOSE DOORS

16:02.210 --> 16:04.170
THEY'RE GOING TO PICK
US OFF LIKE FLIES.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.880
YOU'RE RIGHT. OKAY.

16:07.920 --> 16:12.010
THE GOOD NEWS IS
I MANAGED TO SAVE ONE BULLET.

16:12.050 --> 16:14.470
THEN WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO MAKE IT COUNT.

16:14.510 --> 16:15.720
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

16:16.970 --> 16:21.190
&lt;GRUNTS&gt; WHO'S A
BETTER SHOT, YOU OR ME?

16:21.230 --> 16:24.190
I'M A THREE-TIME
ALL NEWFOUNDLAND
BEST BULLET CHAMPION,

16:24.230 --> 16:26.860
AND YOU'RE A PRIVATE EYE
WHO DOESN'T OWN A GUN.

16:29.360 --> 16:31.320
OKAY. I THINK I'VE GOT A PLAN.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.910
I DID IT. I GOT
THE SECURITY TAPES.

16:38.950 --> 16:41.160
I DID EXACTLY WHAT JAKE
WOULD DO, AND IT WORKED.

16:41.210 --> 16:43.170
I BROKE FOUR OR
FIVE MAJOR LAWS,

16:43.210 --> 16:44.880
AND I DISHED OUT
$200 TO THE GIRL WHO WORKS

16:44.920 --> 16:46.090
NIGHTS AT THE
DEPOSIT BOX PLACE,

16:46.130 --> 16:47.500
AND I GOT A COPY
OF THE SECURITY CAMERAS.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.960
-OKAY. WHAT DID YOU FIND?
-NOTHING.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.170
WELL, THE ROBBERS HAD
SPRAYED THEM ALL OVER.

16:51.220 --> 16:53.220
NOT EXACTLY
MONEY WELL SPENT, SON.

16:53.260 --> 16:55.760
BUT, BUT, BUT, BUT, BUT
I WENT TO THE CHINESE
RESTAURANT NEXT DOOR

16:55.800 --> 16:58.260
AND I GOT THIS.
CHECK IT OUT.

16:58.310 --> 17:01.140
OH, BY THE WAY, DO YOU
THINK I CAN GET THAT $200
PETTY CASH?

17:01.180 --> 17:03.690
-I ALSO PICKED UP
SOME WHOPPERS.
-SHH. WATCH.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.400
&lt;DES LAUGHING&gt;

17:07.440 --> 17:10.230
RIGHT IN THE NECK.
YES, B'Y. THAT
WOULD HURT, ACTUALLY.

17:10.860 --> 17:11.990
BACK IT UP.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.990
JUST BEFORE. THERE.

17:19.450 --> 17:21.500
THE GUARD FLINCHED
BEFORE HE WAS TASERED.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.290
EITHER THE GUARD
KNEW THE TASER WAS COMING...

17:23.330 --> 17:25.120
OR HE HAS EYES IN
THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.

17:25.170 --> 17:27.880
WHICH IS HIGHLY
UNLIKELY, I GUESS.

17:27.920 --> 17:29.750
-THE GUARD IS IN ON THIS.
-THAT'S WHAT I MEANT.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.960
LET'S GO PAY HIM A VISIT.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.270
NOTHING FROM JAKE?

17:41.310 --> 17:44.060
WHAT? OH, NO, I WAS
ACTUALLY CHECKING TO SEE IF
CHANDRA CALLED.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.440
I MEAN, NOT THAT I'M NOT
WORRIED ABOUT JAKE,

17:45.480 --> 17:47.310
IT'S JUST, I THINK I MIGHT BE
MOVING TOO FAST WITH HER.

17:47.350 --> 17:49.060
OR MAYBE TOO SLOW.
OR MAYBE I SHOULD
STOP MOVING ALTOGETHER.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.190
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

17:50.230 --> 17:51.900
NOW IS NOT A GOOD
TIME FOR THAT, DES.

17:52.440 --> 17:53.440
KEEP A LOOK OUT.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.490
[DES] WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

17:56.530 --> 17:58.120
JUST A FRIENDLY CHAT.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.080
-HEY.
-OH, MY GOD! AH!

18:03.120 --> 18:04.500

OR THE ARM COMES OFF.

18:04.540 --> 18:06.540
HEY, MAN, I ALREADY TOLD
YOU. I HAVE NO IDEA, MAN.

18:06.580 --> 18:08.000

18:08.040 --> 18:09.250
JUST TELL ME
WHERE THEY ARE NOW.

18:09.290 --> 18:13.260
I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA!
OW! OW! OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.880
THE GUY PAID ME OFF
TO TAKE A DIVE.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.470
ALL I KNOW IS THAT THEY'RE
IN A WAREHOUSE DOWN
BY THE TRAIN MUSEUM.

18:18.510 --> 18:19.890
THAT'S ALL I KNOW, MAN.

18:19.930 --> 18:23.060
DES, CALL HOOD. HE'S GONNA
WANT TO TALK TO KENNY HERE.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.930
&lt;GRUNTS&gt;

18:24.980 --> 18:26.640
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

18:26.690 --> 18:29.350

GETTING THROUGH THAT DOOR.

18:38.860 --> 18:40.120

18:41.870 --> 18:43.790
YOU'RE ONLY GONNA
GET ONE SHOT AT THIS.

18:43.830 --> 18:45.330
ARE YOU SURE YOU
DON'T WANT ME TO DO IT?

18:45.370 --> 18:48.250
LISTEN, YOU WORRY
ABOUT YOUR JOB,
I'LL WORRY ABOUT MINE.

18:48.290 --> 18:50.540
PLUS, YOU ALREADY
OWE ME FOR ONE BLOUSE.

18:53.750 --> 18:54.800

I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

19:23.870 --> 19:26.830

YEAH, YOU TRY TO GET
OUT OF THAT BED, AND I'M GOING
TO HANDCUFF YOU TO IT.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.300

STAY PUT.

20:28.970 --> 20:30.310

20:35.610 --> 20:37.400

UGH. YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST TELL ME THAT HE'S
WAY BACK IN CALGARY

20:48.330 --> 20:50.870
DATING SOME OTHER GIRL

HE'S A DEADBEAT.

20:50.910 --> 20:52.870
-HE'S IN TOWN.
-WHAT?

20:52.910 --> 20:55.330
I FOUND A RECEIPT OF HIM
HIRING A LOCAL CAB COMPANY.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.840
WE'VE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

20:57.670 --> 21:00.460

21:16.350 --> 21:18.020
ANYTHING TO GET A DAY OFF.

21:18.070 --> 21:20.860
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SAD.
YOU KNOW, A FEW
TEARS WOULD BE NICE.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.360
WALK IT OFF. YOU'LL BE FINE.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.820
-DID THEY CATCH HIM?
-NOT YET.

21:23.860 --> 21:25.700
THEY HAD HELP.
IT WAS AN INSIDE JOB.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.580
[JAKE] THE SECURITY GUARD.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.410
YEAH, BUT PUT THAT OUT OF
YOUR HEAD AND REST.
YOU'VE BEEN SHOT.

21:31.450 --> 21:34.410
AND I HAVEN'T HAD A BITE
TO EAT ALL DAY
THANKS TO SOMEBODY.

21:34.460 --> 21:38.340
LEAVE IT TO THE COPS.
I'M SERIOUS. AND
STOP GETTING SHOT.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.710
OH, FOR THE RECORD,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE NOT DEAD.

21:41.840 --> 21:44.420
SO DID YOU FEEL THE
ACTUAL STEEL, LIKE,

21:44.470 --> 21:47.970
SLICING THROUGH YOUR SKIN
AND YOUR FLESH

21:48.010 --> 21:51.310
AND YOUR MUSCLE
NEVER TO BE TOTALLY
THE SAME EVER AGAIN?

21:51.350 --> 21:53.640
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. LISTEN,
GO OVER THERE AND
GRAB MY SHIRT, QUICK.

21:53.680 --> 21:57.400
SURE. OH, AND LOOK, I
DON'T, I DON'T MEAN TO GET
BLUNT WITH YOU OR ANYTHING,

21:57.440 --> 21:59.730
BUT MAL TOLD ME NOT
TO LET YOU LEAVE THIS ROOM,

21:59.770 --> 22:01.780
AND I AM NOT AFRAID
TO GET PHYSICAL.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.360
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

22:04.440 --> 22:06.530
-HEY, CHANDRA. HEY.
-HEY.

22:06.570 --> 22:09.070
UH, YOU REMEMBER MY
DETECTIVE PARTNER, JAKE DOYLE.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.700
OF COURSE.

22:10.740 --> 22:15.040
WOW. DES, YOU WERE
TOTALLY RIGHT. SHE IS
SPECTACULARLY GORGEOUS.

22:15.080 --> 22:17.290
GLAD TO SEE YOU
HAVEN'T LOST
YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR.

22:17.330 --> 22:18.580
&lt;LAUGHS NERVOUSLY&gt;

22:20.460 --> 22:22.000
WILL HE WALK AGAIN?

22:22.050 --> 22:23.920
I THINK HE'LL BE FINE.

22:23.960 --> 22:26.430
HE'S A REAL STRONG,
GRIN-AND-BEAR IT KIND.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.590
YOU CAN'T KEEP
GUYS LIKE THAT DOWN FOR LONG.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.010
I'VE SEEN HIS TYPE BEFORE.

22:30.800 --> 22:33.220
SO YOU, YOU'VE DATED THAT

22:33.270 --> 22:35.100
KIND BEFORE. I MEAN,
THAT'S THE KIND
OF GUY YOU'RE INTO.

22:35.140 --> 22:40.980
YOU'RE INTO THE ALPHA MALE,
TOP DOG, STRONG, BIG,
ALPHA GUY WHO IS...

22:41.020 --> 22:45.610
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY?
UM, AND YOU GET OUT OF HERE.

22:45.650 --> 22:47.360
OKAY? I NEED TO
EXAMINE HIM ALONE.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.030
OKAY. BYE.

22:50.070 --> 22:51.530
OH, MY GOD,
MY LIFE IS FALLING APART.

22:51.580 --> 22:53.620
FIRST I HAVE A NEAR
BRUSH WITH DEATH,
ONE DEGREE REMOVED,

22:53.660 --> 22:56.410
AND NOW CHANDRA,
SHE'S NOT EVEN
INTO ME ANYMORE.

22:56.450 --> 22:59.670
I NEED TO BE MORE
ASSERTIVE. I NEED TO BE
MORE ALPHA, LESS BETA.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.630
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

23:02.670 --> 23:04.590
GET UP. TAKE OFF YOUR COAT.

23:04.630 --> 23:06.090
WHAT? WHY?
DO YOU NEED SOMETHING?

23:06.130 --> 23:07.970
LISTEN, YOU WANT TO BE
A REAL MAN, TAKE
OFF YOUR SHIRT, NOW.

23:08.010 --> 23:09.050
THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE TO ME.

23:09.090 --> 23:10.680
DO WHAT I SAY, DES.
TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.760
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
OKAY. BUTTONS.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.390
-HURRY. FASTER.
-I'M...

23:14.430 --> 23:15.600
GO, GO, GO, GO.

23:15.640 --> 23:18.390
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT. SO SHOULD... OH!

23:18.730 --> 23:19.810
GO GET HER.

23:19.850 --> 23:21.270
CHANDRA!

23:28.070 --> 23:29.320
I'M GONNA NEED
THAT JACKET BACK.

23:29.360 --> 23:30.530
JAKE!

23:31.820 --> 23:33.910
JAKE, WHAT...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:33.950 --> 23:35.700
WHAT? THE DOC RELEASED ME.

23:35.740 --> 23:39.290
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO TRACK
DOWN A COUPLE OF SKEETS WHO
ARE ROBBING SOME JEWELRY?

23:39.330 --> 23:40.460
LITTLE HELP HERE?

23:40.500 --> 23:42.040
YOU ARE IN NO CONDITION.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.630
YOU WERE WORRIED
ABOUT ME, WEREN'T YOU?

23:46.630 --> 23:48.130
DID YOU THINK I WAS GONNA DIE?

23:48.170 --> 23:49.510
NO.

23:50.510 --> 23:52.220
YES, YOU DID.

23:53.720 --> 23:54.850
TELL THE TRUTH.

24:01.900 --> 24:04.610
WHAT... WHAT IS THIS?

24:06.070 --> 24:08.610
JAKE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT AM I DOING?

24:08.650 --> 24:12.360
WELL, TECHNICALLY WE'RE
MAKING OUT IN A MORGUE,
WHICH, I GUESS...

24:12.410 --> 24:13.780
I GUESS IT IS
KIND OF INAPPROPRIATE.

24:13.820 --> 24:17.160
SO WHAT DO YOU
SAY WE JUST, UH, COOL IT
AND WE TAKE OUR TIME, OKAY?

24:18.290 --> 24:20.250
ALL RIGHT.

24:20.290 --> 24:22.670
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
EXCEPT STRAIGHT TO BED.

24:22.710 --> 24:25.210
WELL, THAT GOES AGAINST
EVERYTHING I JUST SAID,

24:25.250 --> 24:26.960
BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO TO BED,
THAT'S COOL, TOO.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.380
STOP IT. I'M
SERIOUS. YOU'RE NOT
LEAVING THIS HOSPITAL.

24:30.420 --> 24:33.760
ALL RIGHT. I GUESS YOU
DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHO
WAS IN ON THAT JOB THEN.

24:34.640 --> 24:35.890
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

24:35.930 --> 24:38.470
AH, AH, AH, NOT SO FAST.
NOT UNLESS WE HAVE A DEAL.

24:39.640 --> 24:42.690
OKAY? YOU GO THIS ALONE,
OR YOU LET ME IN.

24:43.650 --> 24:44.730
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

24:44.770 --> 24:47.070
NOTHING REALLY.

24:47.110 --> 24:50.860
THE JEWELRY BELONGED TO SOME
OLD WOMAN WHO PASSED AWAY
A FEW WEEKS AGO. THAT'S IT.

24:50.900 --> 24:54.320
I GUESS YOU GOT
A CHOICE TO MAKE.
EITHER YOU COMMIT ME,

24:54.950 --> 24:56.280
OR WE DO THIS TOGETHER.

24:57.700 --> 25:00.540
DEAL. SPILL IT.

25:00.580 --> 25:03.370
IT'S AN INSIDE JOB.
CAN YOU HELP ME
WITH MY COAT PLEASE?

25:05.210 --> 25:07.840
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO TRACK DOWN
A SECURITY GUARD?

25:12.670 --> 25:16.640
WELL, WE'LL HAVE TO GET A
NEW CAMERA. OR WAIT, FIND OUT
WHAT IT TAKES TO CLEAN IT.

25:17.720 --> 25:18.890
YEAH.

25:20.140 --> 25:22.600
EXCUSE ME. DO YOU WORK HERE?

25:22.640 --> 25:24.730
YES, OFFICER. WHAT CAN
I DO FOR YOU?

25:24.770 --> 25:27.020
WE'RE LOOKING FOR AN EMPLOYEE.
HIS NAME IS KENNY.

25:27.060 --> 25:30.690
KENNY? NO, HE'S ALREADY
LEFT FOR THE DAY. WHY ARE
YOU LOOKING FOR HIM?

25:30.730 --> 25:32.530
THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME
EVIDENCE THAT HE MAY HAVE

25:32.570 --> 25:34.400
PARTICIPATED
IN THE ROBBERY TODAY.

25:34.450 --> 25:36.280
NO WAY. KENNY?

25:36.320 --> 25:39.700
MOST DAYS HE'S NOT
SMART ENOUGH TO
PUT HIS SOCKS ON RIGHT.

25:39.740 --> 25:42.620
NO, NO, NO, NO. DON'T
TRY TO CLEAN IT YOURSELF.

25:42.660 --> 25:46.000
HEY, LOOK. HE'S GOT SOME
PAINT FROM THE EXPLOSION.

25:46.040 --> 25:47.710
YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS
GUY IS OUR MALE ROBBER?

25:49.920 --> 25:52.760
SO, WE ALL GOOD HERE?

25:52.800 --> 25:54.720
OH, YEAH, BUDDY.
WE ARE BEST KIND.

25:55.380 --> 25:57.050
ALL RIGHT.

25:57.090 --> 25:59.890
LET'S GO FOLLOW HIM.
I THINK I SHOULD DRIVE.

25:59.930 --> 26:01.720
YES, B'Y. I KNOWS YOU WILL.

26:05.640 --> 26:06.730
WHY CAN'T I DRIVE?

26:06.770 --> 26:08.190
IT'S MY CAR!

26:13.610 --> 26:14.820
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

26:19.490 --> 26:22.080
STOP! PUT YOUR
HANDS IN THE AIR!

26:22.120 --> 26:23.830
OH, GOD.

26:23.870 --> 26:26.210
YOU SEE? YOU SEE?
THEY TOTALLY FOLLOWED YOU.

26:26.250 --> 26:27.750
NO, THEY DID NOT.
THEY FOLLOWED YOU.

26:27.790 --> 26:28.880
LIKELY.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.290
TELL HER. WHO DID YOU FOLLOW?

26:30.340 --> 26:32.130
WHO DO YOU THINK
WE FOLLOWED, IDIOT?

26:33.250 --> 26:34.340
DON'T MOVE.

26:34.380 --> 26:35.800
IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

26:35.840 --> 26:38.180
OH, SO YOU DIDN'T ROB A
SECURITY COMPANY THEN?

26:38.220 --> 26:40.850
NO, I DID, I MEAN, WE
DID. BUT WE HAD A GOOD REASON.

26:40.890 --> 26:42.220
YEAH, A VERY,
VERY GOOD REASON.

26:42.260 --> 26:44.850
TURN AROUND, PUT YOUR
HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD.

26:45.640 --> 26:46.600
&lt;CAR APPROACHING&gt;

26:47.690 --> 26:49.270
LESLIE! GO, GO, GO!

26:50.310 --> 26:51.480
COME HERE!

26:52.020 --> 26:53.480
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

26:54.570 --> 26:56.030
YOU'RE GONNA CUT ME
OUT OF MY SHARE, ROGER?

26:56.070 --> 26:57.320
NO!

26:57.360 --> 26:58.530
PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON.

26:58.570 --> 26:59.820
TRY IT AND HE DIES.

26:59.860 --> 27:02.120
BARBARA, BRING THE JEWELRY
AND GET IN THE TRUCK.

27:02.160 --> 27:04.700
DON'T YOU SHOOT ME,
LESLIE. I WAS ALREADY
SHOT ONCE TODAY

27:05.540 --> 27:06.540
OW!

27:07.330 --> 27:08.460
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

27:08.500 --> 27:09.870
STOP! STOP THEM!
YOU GOTTA STOP THEM!

27:09.920 --> 27:11.840
STAY WHERE YOU ARE!

27:11.880 --> 27:14.000
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I HAD TO DO IT. WE NEED
THE MONEY FOR OUR CHILD!

27:19.930 --> 27:21.890
I KNOW IT SOUNDS WEIRD,
BUT YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND.

27:21.930 --> 27:24.100
UNDERSTAND?
YOU PULLED A HEIST.

27:24.140 --> 27:27.430
YEAH, BUT IT WAS FOR
THE RIGHT REASONS. IT WAS
FOR MY CHILD'S FUTURE.

27:27.480 --> 27:30.690
SEE THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
WE HAVE NO RECORD
OF YOU HAVING A KID.

27:30.730 --> 27:32.690
NO BIRTH CERTIFICATE, NO NAME.

27:32.730 --> 27:35.820
DIRK, IF IT'S A BOY,
AND, AND, AND
JASMINE IF IT'S A GIRL.

27:36.730 --> 27:38.490
YOUR WIFE'S PREGNANT?

27:38.530 --> 27:41.780
NO. NO, NOT YET. BUT THAT'S
WHY WE NEEDED THE MONEY.

27:41.820 --> 27:42.990
OH.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.370
WE SHOULD HEAR HIM OUT.

27:45.410 --> 27:49.040
I KNOW WHAT WE DID
WAS WRONG, BUT WE DIDN'T
HAVE A CHOICE. OKAY?

27:49.080 --> 27:54.420
BARBARA, MY WIFE, SHE'S,
SHE'S WANTED A BABY FOR
A LONG TIME, BUT I HAVE...

27:54.460 --> 27:56.420
I HAVE SOME PROBLEMS
IN THAT AREA, SO...

27:56.460 --> 27:59.300
AH. HE SHOOTS BLANKS.

27:59.340 --> 28:03.890
NOT THAT IT MAKES ME ANY LESS
OF A MAN, BUT, YOU KNOW, I
NEED HELP AND IT'S EXPENSIVE.

28:03.930 --> 28:07.140
YEAH, WELL, IN VITRO
FERTILIZATION CAN BE.

28:09.980 --> 28:11.980
MY SISTER.

28:12.020 --> 28:15.820
SO, YOU AND YOUR WIFE
THOUGHT THAT ROBBING
AN ARMORED VAN

28:15.860 --> 28:17.940
WAS THE BEST WAY TO DEAL
WITH YOUR FERTILITY WORRIES?

28:17.980 --> 28:20.820
WELL, WE HAD TO.
BECAUSE BARBARA WAS
RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

28:20.860 --> 28:22.360
SHE FELT IT
WAS HER LAST CHANCE,

28:22.410 --> 28:24.410
AND WE NEEDED,
WE NEED MONEY FAST, SO...

28:24.450 --> 28:27.830
SO YOU ROBBED
AN ARMORED VAN?

28:27.870 --> 28:31.540
I COULDN'T JUST
OPEN A BOX AND WALK OUT.
I WOULD'VE GOT CAUGHT.

28:31.580 --> 28:35.500
SO WE CUT KENNY IN ON IT
IT WAS KIND OF HIS IDEA.

28:35.540 --> 28:37.710
BUT NOW KENNY THINKS
WE WERE GONNA CHEAT
HIM OUT OF HIS SHARE

28:37.750 --> 28:39.960
BECAUSE YOU GUYS SHOWED UP,
SO HE TOOK BABS AND...

28:41.880 --> 28:43.680
YOU GOTTA GET MY WIFE BACK.

28:45.350 --> 28:46.550
LET'S GO.

28:55.610 --> 28:56.860
YOU BELIEVING ANY OF THAT?

28:56.900 --> 28:58.900
WELL, I BELIEVE
THAT ROGER DOES.

28:58.940 --> 29:00.860
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY HE LOVES
HIS WIFE THAT

29:00.900 --> 29:03.660
HE'D BUY ANY OLD
FOOLISH STORY
THAT SHE'D TELL HIM.

29:03.700 --> 29:06.950
EITHER WAY, THERE'S
DEFINITELY MORE GOING ON HERE,

29:06.990 --> 29:09.870
AND WE GOTTA TRACK DOWN
BARBARA AND KENNY
TO GET THE TRUTH.

29:09.910 --> 29:11.910
LET ME SEE THAT.

29:14.710 --> 29:17.130
WE ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

29:17.170 --> 29:21.170
OW! LESLIE, BUT...
OH COME ON. WE
WERE DOING SO WELL.

29:21.210 --> 29:23.470
IF YOU DIE,
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU.

29:23.510 --> 29:25.680
YOU'RE GETTING
ESCORTED BACK TO THE HOSPITAL.

29:29.470 --> 29:30.930
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

29:30.970 --> 29:33.560
CAN'T A FATHER GRAB A BITE
WITHOUT SOMEBODY
GETTING IN THE LINE OF FIRE?

29:33.600 --> 29:35.020
LOOK, I'M THE ONE THAT
GOT SHOT, ALL RIGHT?

29:35.060 --> 29:37.690
THE LEAST I CAN
DO IS FIND OUT
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.

29:37.730 --> 29:39.400
YOU STAY IN THAT HOSPITAL BED.

29:39.440 --> 29:40.980
DODGE DES AGAIN
AND I'LL SKIN YOU.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.950
SO I THOUGHT
I MIGHT DROP BY LATER,

29:46.990 --> 29:50.540
OR MAYBE NOT, BECAUSE
I HAVE SOME EXCITING,
MANLY THINGS TO DO.

29:50.580 --> 29:51.950
HOW DOES THAT SOUND?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.040
YOU'RE ASKING ME IF
THAT'S WHAT YOU
SHOULD SAY TO CHANDRA?

29:54.080 --> 29:57.210
YEAH, YEAH. WELL, YOU'RE A
GIRL, KIND OF. I MEAN, WHAT
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE TO YOU?

29:57.250 --> 29:59.540
I'M "KIND OF A GIRL"?

29:59.590 --> 30:03.210
DES, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU
SAY TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
STOP CALLING ME!

30:03.260 --> 30:07.090
NO, NO, NO! TINNY YOU ARE
TOTALLY A GIRL! YOU ARE
SO MUCH A GIRL! TIN... AH!

30:07.140 --> 30:09.720
SHE WAS WONDERING IF...
MY SHIRT LOOKS AWESOME ON YOU.

30:09.760 --> 30:10.890
DES, WHAT DO
YOU HAVE ON KENNY?

30:10.930 --> 30:13.850
ME? NOTHING. I HAVEN'T BEEN
WORKING THE CASE AT ALL.

30:13.890 --> 30:16.850
LOOK, I KNOW FATHER TOLD
YOU NOT TO TELL ME ANYTHING,

30:16.890 --> 30:18.310
BUT TELL ME ANYWAY.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.860
NO. LOOK. NO. YES. OKAY,

30:20.900 --> 30:23.740
DON'T PUT ME IN THE MIDDLE
OF THIS MAN-FIGHT, ALL RIGHT?
I SUCK AT TUG-OF-WAR.

30:23.780 --> 30:27.910
LOOK, I AM HANDCUFFED TO
A HOSPITAL BED, OKAY?
AT LEAST JUST HUMOR ME.

30:27.950 --> 30:30.830
IT'S WHAT YOU DO
FOR A FRIEND WHEN YOU
VISIT THEM IN THE HOSPITAL.

30:32.290 --> 30:33.910
FRIENDS?

30:33.950 --> 30:36.290
REALLY? I KNEW YOU
FELT THE SAME WAY.
COME HERE, MAN.

30:36.330 --> 30:38.880
-&lt;YELLS IN PAIN&gt;
-OH, I FORGOT! I'M SORRY.
HERE. NO, I FOR...

30:38.920 --> 30:40.920
-DON'T TOUCH ME! DON'T TOUCH!
-OKAY. I'M SORRY.

30:40.960 --> 30:42.840
I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT A CARD.
I WAS GOING TO BRING A CARD,

30:42.880 --> 30:44.670
BUT I THEN I THOUGHT
THAT YOU MIGHT THINK
IT WAS PRESUMPTUOUS

30:44.710 --> 30:46.510
-OR SOMETHING WEIRD LIKE THAT.
-DES! KENNY.

30:46.550 --> 30:48.430
RIGHT. OH, OH,
I GOT HIS HOME ADDY.

30:48.470 --> 30:52.310
-NICE. GIVE IT TO ME.
YEAH, I NEED A PEN.
-WHAT? WHY?

30:52.350 --> 30:55.060
I NEED A PEN, DES. IN
CASE I GET A CAST,

30:55.100 --> 30:57.020
AND I'LL HAVE
TO GET YOU TO SIGN IN FOR ME.

-OKAY. OKAY.
-OKAY?

31:09.910 --> 31:11.490
-EMBRACE IT?

31:11.530 --> 31:13.530
YEAH? OH, YEAH, IT DOES.

HAND RIGHT THERE.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.040

SO HE'S IN TOWN?

31:47.150 --> 31:48.320
WHAT'S OUR NEXT MOVE?

31:48.360 --> 31:50.450
WELL, I'M THINKING WE
SHOULD PROBABLY
GO TO THE POLICE

31:50.490 --> 31:53.240
IF WILL SENDS ANOTHER ONE OF
THOSE LETTERS, OR GOD FORBID
DOES SOMETHING WORSE.

31:53.950 --> 31:55.790

31:55.830 --> 31:57.120

31:57.160 --> 31:59.500

32:00.750 --> 32:02.960
OH, OH. OKAY. UH.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.760

32:07.800 --> 32:09.840

32:09.880 --> 32:14.100
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY DON'T

32:25.980 --> 32:28.990
-COME ON.
-OKAY, WHAT IS IT THAT
YOU ACTUALLY WANT?

32:30.610 --> 32:32.660
I WANT A DIVORCE.

32:33.910 --> 32:36.240
HE'S CHEATED
ON ME A DOZEN TIMES.

32:38.080 --> 32:40.870
I'M TIRED OF FIGHTING
ALL YOU WHORES OFF.

32:40.910 --> 32:42.170
THAT'S IT.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.790
WHOA, WHOA! MOM!

32:43.830 --> 32:48.130
OKAY, KATHLEEN PROBABLY
COULD HELP YOU WITH
THIS SOMEHOW. RIGHT?

32:48.170 --> 32:50.130
AND HOW IS THE TRAMP
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?

32:50.170 --> 32:52.840
-SHE'S GOT A POINT.
DID YOU JUST CALL ME A TRAMP?
-MMM-HMM.

32:52.880 --> 32:53.970
MOM.

32:55.180 --> 32:58.600
CAN YOU CLEAN UP
YOUR MESS? PLEASE?

33:01.230 --> 33:02.730
OKAY.

33:09.480 --> 33:13.110
OKAY. YOU HAVE A LAWSUIT?

33:13.150 --> 33:15.070
-I'M GUESSING HERE.
-YEAH.

33:15.110 --> 33:17.490
SO? NOT THAT IT'S
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.

33:17.530 --> 33:20.790
SO I HAVE PICTURES.
I HAVE, UM,

33:22.660 --> 33:24.540
DETAILED PICTURES.

33:25.960 --> 33:27.790
THAT COULD MAYBE
HELP YOU WITH YOUR LAWSUIT.

33:29.500 --> 33:32.170
AND PICK UP
MY BILL AT THE B&amp;B?

33:32.220 --> 33:36.140
WILL FOUND OUT I WAS
RACKING UP CHARGES
AND CANCELLED THE CREDIT CARD.

33:38.100 --> 33:42.310
OKAY, DEAL. I'LL GET YOU THE
PICTURES AND YOU GO AWAY
AND YOU NEVER COME BACK.

33:42.350 --> 33:45.730
FINE. I WILL
SEE YOU IN THE A.M.

33:51.820 --> 33:52.900
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HER?

33:54.490 --> 33:55.910
NOTHING.

33:56.910 --> 33:58.320
NOTHING?

34:00.910 --> 34:02.250
[LESLIE] YOU'RE TOO MUCH,
YOU KNOW THAT?

34:02.290 --> 34:03.290
UH, THANK YOU?

34:03.330 --> 34:06.120
ALWAYS GOTTA BE THE HERO,
ALWAYS GOTTA DO IT YOURSELF.

34:06.170 --> 34:09.090
LOOK, I JUST...
IT COULD HAVE BEEN YOU.

34:09.130 --> 34:11.960
-WHAT?
-THE BULLET THAT HIT ME.
IT COULD'VE HIT YOU,

34:12.000 --> 34:15.260
AND IT'S NOT LIKE I'M JUST
GONNA LIE BACK AND WAIT
WHILE YOU SOLVE THIS THING.

34:15.300 --> 34:17.840
DO I NEED TO REMIND
YOU THAT I WORK
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT?

34:17.890 --> 34:19.260
THIS IS THE ONE HERE.

34:19.300 --> 34:21.930
AND THAT I'M ONE OF
THE TOP RANKED
OFFICERS IN THE RNC?

34:21.970 --> 34:23.310
WELL, I... I KNOW.

34:23.350 --> 34:24.310
POLICE!

34:26.270 --> 34:27.190
WELL, THAT WAS HOT.

34:33.150 --> 34:36.740
WELL, IF YOU WANT TO FIGHT
YOUR OWN BATTLES, THIS IS A
PERFECT ONE FOR YOU. GIV'ER.

34:37.660 --> 34:41.200
UH, SIR. YOU WANNA
GET UP, THERE?

34:44.290 --> 34:45.370
UH-OH.

34:45.410 --> 34:47.920
WHERE'S THE JEWELRY?
WHERE'D YOU STASH IT?

34:49.540 --> 34:51.210
DOES IT MATTER?

34:51.250 --> 34:52.750
NOTHING MATTERS.

34:54.590 --> 34:57.800
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, MAN.
WE, WE HAD THIS THING.

34:58.300 --> 35:00.260
WE HAD THIS PLAN.

35:00.300 --> 35:04.390
IT HAD TO DO WITH
LOVE. YOU, YOU KNOW THE
NAME OF THAT SONG, RIGHT?

35:04.430 --> 35:06.350
WHAT'S THAT SONG?

35:06.390 --> 35:09.350
LOOK, BUDDY, WE'RE HAVING A
BIT OF A CRAP DAY, ALL RIGHT,
SO JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.150
SORRY, SORRY.

35:14.110 --> 35:15.230
WHAT WAS THE QUESTION?

35:15.280 --> 35:17.610
THE JEWELRY. WHERE IS IT?

35:19.860 --> 35:23.280
MMM. BARBARA TOOK IT.
TOOK THE JEWELRY
AND EVERYTHING.

35:24.620 --> 35:26.080
ALONG WITH MY HEART.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.710
&lt;CRYING&gt;

35:31.040 --> 35:32.710
SO RUN THIS FOR
US ONE MORE TIME.

35:32.750 --> 35:34.670
OKAY, OKAY.

35:35.670 --> 35:37.760
SO I BRING BARBARA BACK
TO MY PLACE,

35:37.800 --> 35:40.840
AND I'M FREAKING OUT
BECAUSE I GOT A LOT
OF MONEY IN JEWELRY.

35:41.300 --> 35:42.300
250 K.

35:42.350 --> 35:45.060
RIGHT. AND, LIKE,

35:45.100 --> 35:46.970
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN IN THE WORLD.

35:47.020 --> 35:49.520
BARBARA? YOU AND
BARBARA WERE...

35:49.560 --> 35:51.350
YEAH, WE WERE SEEING EACH...

35:51.400 --> 35:55.480
BUT LIKE ON THE DOWN LOW
ON ACCOUNT OF HER HUSBAND.
YOU KNOW, BUT I'M THINKING...

35:55.520 --> 35:59.400
BARBARA WAKES UP AND SHE
FIGURES, HEY, SHE WANTS TO
BE WITH ME, LIKE, FULL TIME,

35:59.450 --> 36:02.410
BUT SHE CAN'T HERE.
BUT IF WE HAD THE
MONEY TO START A NEW LIFE...

36:02.450 --> 36:07.290
SO YOU DECIDE TO PULL
THIS BIG JOB AND THEN
MAKE ROGER YOUR PATSY.

36:07.330 --> 36:09.210
RIGHT.

36:09.250 --> 36:13.000
BUT SHE TELLS ROGER THAT
SHE NEEDS THE CASH FOR
MAKING BABIES OR WHATEVER,

36:13.040 --> 36:17.590
BUT IN TRUTH SHE WANTS
THE DOE SO THAT SHE CAN
RUN AWAY WITH ME.

36:17.630 --> 36:19.880
YOU CAN SEE I'M JUST AN
INNOCENT VICTIM HERE.

36:19.920 --> 36:24.300
YEAH, WELL, I THINK
I CAN PUT YOU IN JAIL FOR
SOMETHING. LET'S GO.

36:24.350 --> 36:29.520
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT. I'LL TOTALLY FLIP.
FREEDOM FOR INFORMATION. DEAL?

36:32.190 --> 36:34.980
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THE DEAL.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE BARBARA IS?

36:35.400 --> 36:37.020
NO IDEA.

36:38.070 --> 36:42.280
BUT... AS YOU CAN SEE,
LIKE, IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

36:42.320 --> 36:46.490
I MEAN, IF ALL THAT STUFF
HADN'T HAVE GONE MISSING
FROM THE DEPOSIT BOX PLACE,

36:46.530 --> 36:48.540
WELL, WE WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN MOVING ANYTHING.

36:48.580 --> 36:51.460
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. THERE
WERE OTHER ROBBERIES?

36:51.500 --> 36:55.920
YEAH. A COUPLE OF PEOPLE
COMPLAINED. YOU KNOW, DEAD
PEOPLE MOSTLY.

36:55.960 --> 37:00.300
THEIR FAMILIES, LIKE, UH, WHEN
THEY CAME WITH THE WILL TO
COLLECT THEIR INHERITANCE.

37:00.340 --> 37:02.170
AND WHO WAS ROBBING THE STUFF?

37:02.220 --> 37:05.430
ROGER WAS
USING HIS KEY TO STEAL
FROM SECURITY BOXES

37:05.470 --> 37:09.100
WHEN THE OWNERS DIED
TO BUILD HIS BABY-MAKING FUND.

37:09.140 --> 37:12.270
SO WHAT? THIS WAS LIKE
ONE BIG LAST SCORE?

37:12.310 --> 37:15.860
WHERE'D HE STASH
THE REST OF THE LOOT?

37:15.900 --> 37:19.690
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU
WHERE IF YOU, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
GIVE ME THE DEAL.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.040
SHE'S REALLY HAVING TO
WORK HARD FOR HER MONEY TODAY.

37:33.080 --> 37:34.870
I ALMOST FEEL BAD FOR HER.

37:36.460 --> 37:38.630
THERE'S THE BAG OF LOOT
THAT HER HUSBAND
MUST HAVE STOLE.

37:40.460 --> 37:43.260
STAY WHERE YOU
ARE OR I'LL SHOOT.

37:45.010 --> 37:47.140
BARBARA, DROP THE BAG.
HANDS IN THE AIR.

37:47.470 --> 37:48.470
&lt;GUNSHOT&gt;

37:49.680 --> 37:51.350
LAST CHANCE.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.650
NOT A MOVE.
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

37:56.690 --> 38:00.780
NO, YOU CAN'T ARREST ME.
YOU CAN'T. I'M PREGNANT.

38:05.570 --> 38:08.070
BARBARA, WE KNOW FOR A
FACT THAT ROGER IS INFERTILE.

38:08.530 --> 38:10.910
BUT KENNY ISN'T.

38:10.950 --> 38:13.830
I THINK IT'S TIME YOU TOLD
US THE WHOLE STORY HERE.

38:13.870 --> 38:17.920
ROGER AND I HAD BEEN
TRYING FOR OVER A YEAR
WITH NO SUCCESS,

38:17.960 --> 38:20.340
AND AFTER A WHILE IT...

38:20.380 --> 38:22.800
YOU KNOW, STARTED TO BE
MORE LIKE WORK THAN...

38:22.840 --> 38:24.510
WHAT IT SHOULD BE?

38:24.550 --> 38:27.760
YEAH. AND THEN
KENNY CAME ALONG,

38:27.800 --> 38:30.550
AND HE WAS FUN, AND
ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER...

38:30.600 --> 38:33.520
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. YOU
STARTED HAVING SEX WITH KENNY

38:33.560 --> 38:35.770
TO TAKE YOUR MIND OFF
OF HAVING SEX WITH ROGER?

38:35.810 --> 38:38.520
-AND THE NEXT
THING YOU KNOW...
-YOU ENDED UP PREGGERS, HEY?

38:38.560 --> 38:40.520
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO,

38:40.560 --> 38:43.480
SO I PANICKED AND I CAME UP
WITH THIS WITH THIS STUPID
IDEA TO ROB AN ARMOURED VAN.

38:43.530 --> 38:47.200
YOU KNOW, I'M STILL NOT REALLY
FOLLOWING YOUR LOGIC HERE.

38:47.240 --> 38:50.950
I THOUGHT IF I COULD
GET ENOUGH MONEY FOR THE IN
VITRO FERTILIZATION TREATMENT,

38:50.990 --> 38:55.250
THEN I COULD TRICK ROGER
INTO THINKING THAT
THE BABY WAS HIS.

38:55.290 --> 38:58.420
BUT I-- HAD TO DO IT QUICKLY,
BECAUSE I'D START
SHOWING TOO SOON.

38:58.460 --> 39:04.300
SO WAIT A MINUTE. YOU THOUGHT
YOU COULD TRICK ROGER INTO
THINKING KENNY'S BABY WAS HIS?

39:04.340 --> 39:06.920
WELL, I HAVE
A 50/50 SHOT, RIGHT?

39:06.970 --> 39:08.340
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

39:09.590 --> 39:11.550
YOU WEREN'T.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.520
WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN TO MY BABY?

39:23.440 --> 39:26.490
HEY. WHAT'S WITH YOU?

39:27.400 --> 39:28.990
NOTHING. NOTHING.

39:29.030 --> 39:30.820
I'M TOO TOUGH FOR PROBLEMS.
YOU KNOW THAT.

39:30.870 --> 39:32.320
OH.

39:33.200 --> 39:35.620
I'M SCREWED. CHANDRA'S
TOTALLY OVER ME.

39:35.660 --> 39:37.460
SHE SAW ME HANDCUFFED ONCE
AND THEN SHE SAW ME NAKED FROM

39:37.500 --> 39:40.250
-THE WAIST UP ANOTHER TIME.
-REALLY, REALLY DON'T
WANT TO KNOW THAT, DES.

39:40.290 --> 39:42.630
SHE'S JUST REALLY, SHE'S
JUST ALWAYS TOO BUSY FOR ME.

39:42.670 --> 39:44.710
AND THEN WITH JAKE,

39:44.750 --> 39:48.630
WITH JAKE SHE'S LIKE LAUGHING,
AND SHE'S PAYING ATTENTION
TO HIS ALPHA PHEROMONES.

39:48.670 --> 39:50.380
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO
BE LIKE UNCLE JAKE?

39:50.430 --> 39:53.430
YOU'VE SEEN HIS RELATIONSHIPS
THEY'RE TRAINWRECKS, RIGHT?

39:53.470 --> 39:54.970
JUST GIVE IT TO ME STRAIGHT.
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD

39:55.010 --> 39:56.640
BREAK UP WITH CHANDRA
BEFORE SHE BREAKS UP WITH ME?

39:56.680 --> 39:59.270
JUST DO SOMETHING AND
STOP MOPING AROUND.

39:59.310 --> 40:00.480
NOBODY'S INTO THAT.

40:07.230 --> 40:08.740
YOU SURE THIS IS THE
RIGHT THING TO DO?

40:08.780 --> 40:11.530
SHE'S PREGNANT, AND WE
HAVE A PROCESS
FOR THIS KIND OF THING.

40:11.570 --> 40:14.660
THE HOSPITAL IS THE BEST
PLACE FOR HER AND HER CHILD
RIGHT NOW.

40:14.700 --> 40:18.040
BARBARA! TELL ME IT'S
NOT TRUE. TELL ME
YOU DIDN'T LIE.

40:18.080 --> 40:20.160
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T
WANT YOU TO HATE ME.

40:20.210 --> 40:21.460
NO, I LOVE YOU.

40:21.500 --> 40:23.330
AND I'LL
LOVE THE BABY TOO,
EVEN IF IT'S NOT MINE.

40:31.510 --> 40:34.350
MAYBE THEY SHOULD
HAVE TALKED THINGS OUT.

40:34.390 --> 40:37.470
OH, YOU KNOW, IT'S A LOT
MORE FUN TO GET INTO
A BIT OF ARMED ROBBERY.

40:37.510 --> 40:40.480
ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU DON'T LOOK RIGHT.

40:40.520 --> 40:42.520
I'M, UH, I'M THE BEST...
BEST KIND.

40:43.850 --> 40:45.650
JAKE! CAN I GET
SOME HELP HERE?

40:45.690 --> 40:46.980
[MAN] STAY THERE.

40:50.320 --> 40:54.450
ALL RIGHT, EVERYTHING
CHECKS OUT, AND NO MORE
DISAPPEARING ACTS.

40:54.490 --> 40:57.990
I'M COMING BACK WITH A SHOT
THAT'LL KEEP YOU IN THIS BED
TILL NEXT THURSDAY.

41:01.370 --> 41:05.000
SLEEP WELL, SON, BECAUSE
I'M GONNA MURDER YOU
THE FIRST CHANCE I GET.

41:05.040 --> 41:06.750
STOP BEING AN IDIOT.

41:07.460 --> 41:08.880
THAT'S THE PLAN.

41:11.170 --> 41:12.470
LESLIE.

41:15.050 --> 41:16.100
THANK YOU.

41:18.010 --> 41:20.220
-HEY. HI.
-DES.

41:20.270 --> 41:22.690
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WERE
FREE FOR DINNER TONIGHT.

41:22.730 --> 41:26.560
OH, DES, I WOULD LOVE
TO, AND I KNOW I'VE BEEN A
TERRIBLE GIRLFRIEND BUT...

41:26.610 --> 41:28.770
GIRLFRIEND?
I MEAN, GIRLFRIEND.

41:28.820 --> 41:33.650
SO IT'S OFFICIAL.
I MEAN, GIRLFRIEND. COOL.

41:33.700 --> 41:38.200
MAYBE WE CAN FIND SOME
TIME NEXT WEEK. I JUST CAN'T
LEAVE THE HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW.

41:38.240 --> 41:40.040
NO, NO, NO. NO. HEY.
SEE YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.580
I JUST CHECKED OUT
THE VENDING MACHINE,

41:41.620 --> 41:44.160
AND I CAN PUT TOGETHER A
SIX-COURSE MEAL FOR $7.50.

41:44.210 --> 41:45.710
-&lt;COINS CLATTERING&gt;
-I'LL CLEAN THAT UP.

41:45.750 --> 41:47.710
I CAN PUT TOGETHER A
SIX-COURSE MEAL FOR $7.50.

41:47.750 --> 41:51.130
NOW THAT'S IF YOU COUNT
JAM JAMS AS APPETIZERS,
WHICH OF COURSE YOU WOULD,

41:51.170 --> 41:55.260
SO, UM, I'LL JUST
WAIT HERE IN THE LOBBY
UNTIL YOU GET A BREAK.

41:59.680 --> 42:03.180
-LET'S MAKE IT THE ON-CALL
ROOM. MORE PRIVATE.
-OKAY.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.530
BARBARA AND ROGER
PLED TO A DEAL.

42:14.570 --> 42:15.820
THEY COPPED TO EVERYTHING

42:15.860 --> 42:19.200
IN EXCHANGE FOR ROGER
BEING ABLE TO SEE
THE BABY WHEN IT'S BORN.

42:19.240 --> 42:21.700
THE THINGS WE DO FOR
THE PEOPLE WE LOVE.

42:23.830 --> 42:25.370
YOU AND ME THOUGH...
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;

42:25.410 --> 42:27.460
I FEEL LIKE WE REALLY MADE
QUITE THE TEAM.

42:29.670 --> 42:31.880
YEAH, I WAS
THINKING ABOUT US.

42:33.340 --> 42:34.630
AS A TEAM.

42:34.670 --> 42:37.760
I DON'T THINK I LIKE
THAT TONE AT ALL.

42:37.800 --> 42:40.760
JAKE, WHAT
HAPPENED, HAPPENED.

42:44.270 --> 42:47.310
YOU AND ME, WHEN WE'RE
TOGETHER, WE MAKE A LOT OF
PROBLEMS FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.

42:48.850 --> 42:49.940
MOSTLY ME.

42:49.980 --> 42:51.570
I WAS THE ONE WHO GOT SHOT.

42:51.610 --> 42:54.530
EXACTLY. WE BOTH
KNOW WHAT'S BEST HERE,

42:54.570 --> 42:57.570
AND IT DOESN'T INVOLVE YOU
AND ME WALKING OFF
INTO THE SUNSET TOGETHER.

43:00.120 --> 43:02.790
WE NEED TO BACK OFF.

43:02.830 --> 43:04.620
-ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
-NO.

43:07.620 --> 43:08.870
BUT THAT'S
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

43:10.380 --> 43:12.420
RIGHT. GREAT. FINE.

43:27.940 --> 43:28.980
GOOD.
