Oh, my God!
We've been robbed!

00:37.458 --> 00:40.041
Come on out,
you thieving bastards!
Dad!

00:40.083 --> 00:43.125
Hayley, you were elected
family gun shield at
the last family meeting.

00:43.166 --> 00:44.959
You're also in charge
of the Netflix queue.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.500
Just know this.

00:46.542 --> 00:48.709
I never don't want to have
Kindergarten Cop.

00:50.750 --> 00:53.709
- Roger, did you see
who did this?
- Yeah. I did this.

00:53.750 --> 00:56.083
I was looking for clues
to where you're throwing
my birthday party.

00:56.125 --> 00:57.709
Found nothing,
so I took a nap.

00:57.750 --> 01:00.333
Roger, we wanted it
to be a surprise.

01:00.375 --> 01:02.417
We're throwing you
a bowling party.

01:02.458 --> 01:05.291
Oh, a bowling party.
How original.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.875
Apparently, I'm
a 13-year-old Latino kid.

01:07.917 --> 01:09.875
Well, what do you
want to do?

01:09.917 --> 01:13.375
Something good! I mean,
you rented out the amphitheater
for Steve's birthday.

01:13.417 --> 01:15.417
We went to a 4 Non Blondes
concert.

01:15.458 --> 01:17.375
It's not our fault
we were the only ones there.

01:17.417 --> 01:21.375
You took Hayley skydiving.
Stan got four pairs of jeans.

01:21.417 --> 01:24.709
I guess you had to come out of--
or regularly visit--
Francine's clown hole...

01:24.750 --> 01:26.458
to matter
around this place.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.291
It is a happening spot.

01:28.333 --> 01:30.166
I want to do
something special.

01:30.208 --> 01:32.917
I'm turning 1,601.
It's when I hit puberty.

01:32.959 --> 01:35.667
Warning. I'm gonna get a lot
more sexually aggressive.

01:35.709 --> 01:37.333
You have any suggestions?
Uh, yeah.

01:37.375 --> 01:39.709
Everyone should avoid wearing
loose-fitting shorts around me.

01:39.750 --> 01:41.917
I'll get in there! Heh!

01:41.959 --> 01:45.333
But seriously, I want
to do what the greats do
when they get celebrated.

01:45.375 --> 01:48.250
- I want a roast.
- Roger, do you even know
what a roast is?

01:48.291 --> 01:51.500
Of course I do. I was a member
of the Friars Club in the '60s.

01:51.542 --> 01:54.500
I drove Phyllis Diller to two
of her first three abortions.

01:54.542 --> 01:57.875
She must have such regret, never
getting her driver's license.

01:57.917 --> 01:59.875
I guess we can do that.

01:59.917 --> 02:02.291
We'll dress up nice,
throw a few good-natured
barbs your way.

02:02.333 --> 02:04.125
Good-natured?
Oh, no.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.375
Don't you dare
go light on me.

02:06.417 --> 02:10.041
- The best roasts
are brutal and hilarious.
- Oh, I think it'll be fun.

02:10.083 --> 02:12.208
You can't participate,
Klaus. I hate you.

02:12.250 --> 02:14.500
I say that not out of anger,
but simply as a fact.

02:14.542 --> 02:17.083
It's 67 degrees outside,
and I hate you.

02:17.125 --> 02:19.875
Well, if that's what
you really want, then
of course we'll do it.

02:19.917 --> 02:22.250
Make it so,
Fran-cisco.

02:22.291 --> 02:24.458
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have my bowling league
tonight.

02:27.959 --> 02:30.208
I'm a-roll a turkey
tonight, ese.

02:35.083 --> 02:37.667
Settle down, everyone.
Who threw that?

02:37.709 --> 02:39.166
Your mother's ass!

02:40.959 --> 02:43.333
Due to recent
financial hardships,

02:43.375 --> 02:47.083
the C.I.A. has been forced
to take on a corporate sponsor.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.542
That sponsor
is Jones Enterprises,

02:49.583 --> 02:51.709
makers of the Chia Pet.

02:51.750 --> 02:53.709
So from now on,
we'll be known as...

02:53.750 --> 02:56.542
the Central Human
Intelligence Agency.

02:58.750 --> 03:01.792
Frank.
Just let him go.

03:01.834 --> 03:06.333
The Chia Pet people
are sending a C.I.A. family
into space for one year...

03:06.375 --> 03:09.500
to see if Chia seeds
grow up there.

03:09.542 --> 03:14.125
The dream of an Afro on the moon
is within our grasp, people.

03:14.166 --> 03:15.917
Looks like
your wife's balls!

03:15.959 --> 03:18.583
Kruger,
you just got yourself
a month in Kabul!

03:18.625 --> 03:21.583
Now--
the agent chosen
for this mission...

03:21.625 --> 03:23.792
was not only
the most qualified.

03:23.834 --> 03:26.834
He also sold the most
magazine subscriptions.

03:26.875 --> 03:30.000
Congratulations,
Sanders!

03:30.041 --> 03:31.875
Can't you even smile?

03:31.917 --> 03:33.583
I don't have any friends
in space.

03:33.625 --> 03:35.250
You're friends
with your sister!

03:38.208 --> 03:41.917
Good evening, and welcome
to the Smith family
roast of Roger Smith.

03:41.959 --> 03:44.750
Say mean things, Stan!
Talk about how he's gray!

03:44.792 --> 03:47.000
You ready, Roger?

03:47.041 --> 03:50.083
Roger is truly one of the most
interesting people I know.

03:50.125 --> 03:51.792
He's also
a pathetic drug addict.

03:51.834 --> 03:53.917
Ho, ho!

03:53.959 --> 03:56.166
I'm gonna read a list
of different drugs.

03:56.208 --> 03:58.792
And, Roger, if you hear one
you're not on right now,
raise your hand.

03:59.709 --> 04:01.458
Cocaine. Heroin.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.083
Ecstasy. Crack.

04:03.125 --> 04:04.834
OxyContin. Meth.

04:04.875 --> 04:07.125
Steroids.
Cooked-down Afrin.

04:07.166 --> 04:09.542
Euphoria, the fake drug
from 90210.

04:11.959 --> 04:15.542
Okay. Next, I'd like to
introduce a woman who is
in a rare group for Roger--

04:15.583 --> 04:18.959
one who hasn't--
Ho-ho!

04:19.000 --> 04:20.834
Let's hear it
for Francine Smith.

04:22.417 --> 04:25.166
Thank you, Stan.

04:25.208 --> 04:27.834
Roger, you're
the most disgusting,

04:27.875 --> 04:30.834
out-of-shape
piece of--
I've ever met in my life.

04:30.875 --> 04:32.792
And I know Sammy Hagar.

04:37.875 --> 04:40.333
A few years ago, we thought
it would be a good idea...

04:40.375 --> 04:43.417
to get Roger a checking account
to teach him responsibility.

04:43.458 --> 04:45.250
Here's what old Rog did.

04:45.291 --> 04:49.750
Here's check 001, the only
check Roger ever wrote.

04:49.792 --> 04:54.709
Please note that
in the date line, he's
written "Today comma 1783."

04:54.750 --> 04:59.834
It's made out
for the amount of $72 million,
and it's payable to "Drugs."

04:59.875 --> 05:02.458
In the memo line,
it says "For Drugs, yo."

05:02.500 --> 05:04.208
And it's signed
"John Travolta."

05:09.959 --> 05:11.792
Anyway, this was
the only check
he ever wrote.

05:11.834 --> 05:13.291
The rest of the checks
have holes in them...

05:13.333 --> 05:16.125
because Roger got drunk
and raped them.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.375
Roger's June 4 diary entry.

05:22.417 --> 05:24.792
It says
"Million-dollar ideas."

05:24.834 --> 05:28.417
And under it, it reads,
"Diarrhea equals Rhea Perlman."
No!

05:28.458 --> 05:31.000
The rest of the pages have holes
in them because he raped them.

05:35.959 --> 05:38.291
All right, it's time to hear
from the man of the hour.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.417
Roger, you drunk,
lazy--

05:40.458 --> 05:42.667
Get the waiter's--
out of your mouth
and get up here.

05:50.417 --> 05:53.500
Why? Why would you
do this?

05:53.542 --> 05:55.750
What-- What did I ever
do to any of you...

05:55.792 --> 05:58.875
to make you say those
incredibly hurtful things?

05:58.917 --> 06:00.750
Are you serious?

06:00.792 --> 06:02.500
Does it look like
I'm not serious?

06:02.542 --> 06:04.417
Roger, this is what
you asked for.

06:04.458 --> 06:07.500
You stay away from me, Francine.
All of you stay away from me.

06:07.542 --> 06:10.500
This has been the worst night
of my entire life!

06:19.709 --> 06:21.625
Morning.
Roger, where have
you been?

06:21.667 --> 06:23.500
We haven't seen you
in days.

06:23.542 --> 06:25.458
Getting my life together.
That's where.

06:25.500 --> 06:28.041
Those comments you made
the other night
resonated in me,

06:28.083 --> 06:30.083
and I decided
it was time for a change.

06:30.125 --> 06:33.333
We didn't say those things
so you'd change.
We were just poking fun.

06:33.375 --> 06:37.000
Well, the person you
described in graphic detail
and in decent joke form...

06:37.041 --> 06:38.792
is not someone
I want to be.

06:38.834 --> 06:40.792
I got a job at a bank,

06:40.834 --> 06:43.166
which should address
the monetary problems
Hayley pointed out.

06:43.208 --> 06:45.208
And I'm also
three days' sober.

06:45.250 --> 06:47.500
Stan, thank you for that
very loud wake-up call.

06:47.542 --> 06:49.417
Who's that
positive girl
with you?

06:49.458 --> 06:53.041
This is Ally, my life coach.
She also works at Jumbo Juice.

06:53.083 --> 06:55.625
She gave me a fiber boost.
Then she gave me a life boost.

06:59.917 --> 07:02.125
She has weird energy,
doesn't she?

07:02.166 --> 07:04.125
She also made me
a goal list.

07:04.166 --> 07:07.500
This is the first piece of paper
I haven't sexually assaulted
in years.

07:07.542 --> 07:10.291
So you're not
mad at us anymore?

07:10.333 --> 07:12.542
God, no.
You saved my life.

07:12.583 --> 07:15.458
Okay. Because you were madder
than we've ever seen you.

07:15.500 --> 07:19.125
- And you do have a history
of holding grudges.
- What? No, I don't.

07:19.166 --> 07:21.041
You wrote death threats
to Merlin Olsen...

07:21.083 --> 07:23.250
for seven years after
Father Murphy was canceled.

07:23.291 --> 07:25.125
He was just the star, Roger.

07:25.166 --> 07:27.417
That was the old me.
I'm done with all that.

07:27.458 --> 07:29.709
By the way, Merlin had
a producer credit
the second season.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.291
He could have
done something.

07:34.959 --> 07:38.041
I'm off for a little night run
at the Howard University track.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.542
Sit down
and have dinner first.
Thank you, no.

07:40.583 --> 07:44.417
I'm going for a run,
and I have to leave here
right now, immediately.

07:44.458 --> 07:46.875
Guys, get in here!
The porn channel's coming in
for some reason.

07:47.917 --> 07:50.417
Nice.

07:51.834 --> 07:54.667
Is everyone okay?

07:54.709 --> 07:56.458
Did we lose the porn?

07:56.500 --> 07:58.125
There must have been
a gas leak.

07:58.166 --> 07:59.917
We could've all been killed.

07:59.959 --> 08:02.875
You know,
Roger sure did
leave in a hurry.

08:02.917 --> 08:06.917
You-- You don't think
Roger had something
to do with the explosion?

08:06.959 --> 08:08.792
Because of the roast?
Guys, you heard him.

08:08.834 --> 08:10.625
We inspired him
to better himself.

08:10.667 --> 08:12.875
Still, to be safe,
we should follow him,

08:12.917 --> 08:15.583
you know,
just to see if he's doing
all the things he says he is.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.125
And 300.
Have a good one.

08:23.959 --> 08:27.000
Hey, Liz, I'm thinking about
going to Nordstrom's at lunch.

08:27.041 --> 08:30.375
You want to grab a sandwich
and walk around Nordstrom's
at lunch, Elizabeth?

08:46.333 --> 08:49.750
You know, the other day,
I took a walk down
to George C. Scott Park...

08:49.792 --> 08:51.458
right when the sun
was going down.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.166
You know how
that time is like.

08:53.208 --> 08:55.500
Sun's throwing shadows
and all.

08:55.542 --> 08:58.750
It got me thinking about
when I was a young man
sitting in that park,

08:58.792 --> 09:02.458
you know, watching the girls,
smoking a little herb,
drinking a cold beer.

09:02.500 --> 09:06.125
And I had this moment when I
wanted to feel that way again.

09:07.542 --> 09:09.125
But I didn't get high.

09:09.166 --> 09:11.709
Instead, I went home
and watched The Wire.

09:11.750 --> 09:13.542
That's where
this speech is from.

09:13.583 --> 09:15.166
Thanks for letting me share.

09:21.959 --> 09:24.792
You guys thought
I tried to kill you?
Hilarious!

09:27.667 --> 09:30.625
It's--
It's so therapeutic
to laugh.

09:30.667 --> 09:32.542
Hey, does anyone
have the exact time?

09:32.583 --> 09:34.250
8:04.
Thank you, my love.

09:34.291 --> 09:36.083
Ow, ow.

09:36.125 --> 09:38.166
My running regimen is
killing my lower back.

09:38.208 --> 09:39.667
I got to lie down.

09:42.083 --> 09:44.875
You guys can get up now!
It's definitely over!

09:48.208 --> 09:50.417
You were right.
Someone is trying
to kill us.

09:50.458 --> 09:52.542
Let's get out of here!
Get in the car. Let's go.

09:56.417 --> 09:58.291
I think we're safe.

09:58.333 --> 10:00.792
Quick thinking
back there, Roger.
Roger?

10:02.125 --> 10:03.709
Roger might be
trying to kill us.

10:04.667 --> 10:05.625
And we have no brakes.

10:18.083 --> 10:21.959
Wow! This is
a really safe car.
Of course it is, Son.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.959
The new Chevy Tumbler has
driver- and passenger-side
air bags...

10:25.000 --> 10:27.458
as well as head curtain-side
impact air bags.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.291
Plus an all-new
third row of seats...

10:29.375 --> 10:32.166
and OnStar with a one-year
Safe & Sound Plan.

10:32.208 --> 10:34.709
This is OnStar.
Is everything okay, Mr. Smith?

10:34.750 --> 10:36.750
Everything's fine, Elaine.
Thank you.

10:36.792 --> 10:39.041
Who the-- is Elaine,
Stan?

10:39.083 --> 10:42.917
♪ I saw the sign
and it opened up my eyes ♪

10:42.959 --> 10:45.291
♪ I saw the sign-- ♪
You're alive!

10:47.125 --> 10:50.041
So you are pissed
about the roast.
You're damn right I am!

10:50.083 --> 10:52.041
You guys all got up
and insulted me...

10:52.083 --> 10:53.875
in the meanest way
possible.

10:53.917 --> 10:56.709
- And you were all laughing.
- Yeah, that's a roast.

10:56.750 --> 10:58.792
Roger.
It's too late!

10:58.834 --> 11:00.917
A switch went off
inside me that night.

11:00.959 --> 11:03.291
And now all I think about
is killing you guys.

11:03.333 --> 11:06.667
That's been my real goal
all along.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.625
My first few attempts failed.

11:08.667 --> 11:11.166
So I'm changing my approach--
gonna get more creative.

11:11.250 --> 11:15.000
Nothing set in stone, although
I'm pretty sure these scorpions
are going in Steve's butt.

11:15.041 --> 11:18.208
They're rare butt-hole eating
scorpions, and they cost me
2,000 bucks each.

11:18.250 --> 11:21.417
But then I'm not very good
with money, am I, Hayley?

11:21.458 --> 11:23.208
Roger, you need
to stop this now!

11:23.250 --> 11:25.291
I'm never gonna stop.

11:32.291 --> 11:33.875
Nice shot, Steve.

11:33.917 --> 11:37.166
Every shot's a nice shot
with a McGregor tranq gun.

11:37.208 --> 11:40.208
McGregor-- it's Scottish
for "bull's-eye."

11:40.250 --> 11:42.500
What are we
gonna do now?

11:42.542 --> 11:44.875
Well, Roger's
clearly committed
to killing us all.

11:44.917 --> 11:47.041
So I'm gonna
put him somewhere
he can't hurt us.

11:53.542 --> 11:55.875
The Bang Kwang
maximum security prison.

11:55.917 --> 11:58.917
No man's ever
gotten out alive.

12:15.375 --> 12:18.000
I feel bad
for Roger.
Don't.

12:18.041 --> 12:21.000
It was either him or us,
and I picked us.

12:21.041 --> 12:24.417
- Oh, my God!
Breaking news from Asia.
- Oh, no.

12:24.458 --> 12:27.166
An inmate has escaped from
the Bang Kwang prison
in Thailand.

12:27.208 --> 12:29.041
The prisoner killed
two dozen guards,

12:29.083 --> 12:31.375
then built a boat out of
their corpses to get away.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
You guys watching the news?

12:35.041 --> 12:38.625
How-- How did you know?
Because I'm right
behind you.

12:38.667 --> 12:40.250
Just kidding.

12:40.291 --> 12:42.000
I'm at the Indianapolis airport
on a layover,

12:42.041 --> 12:43.625
watching a Hoosiers game
at a bar.

12:43.667 --> 12:45.291
Comin' to kill ya!

12:45.333 --> 12:48.375
We gotta get
the hell outta here.
Where are we gonna go?

12:48.417 --> 12:51.166
Hi. You've reached the Smiths.

12:51.208 --> 12:53.417
Leave a message.

12:53.458 --> 12:56.792
Just so you know, there's
nowhere on earth you guys
can go where I can't find you.

12:56.834 --> 12:59.208
Nowhere!

13:01.166 --> 13:02.667
Can I get another iced tea?

13:02.709 --> 13:04.709
Anyone watching this game?
It's a blowout.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.667
You are?
Why? It's a blowout.

13:06.709 --> 13:08.500
You know what,
forget the iced tea.
I'm gonna head to my gate.

13:12.250 --> 13:15.542
Flight 32 to Phoenix
is now boarding at Gate 7.

13:20.583 --> 13:22.625
Hi. Do you have
this week's People?

13:22.667 --> 13:25.375
People magazine?
This week's?

13:28.709 --> 13:30.750
Sir, wait!

13:30.792 --> 13:32.667
Well, according
to this paper,

13:32.709 --> 13:36.083
Smith has sold 10 more magazine
subscriptions than Sanders.

13:36.125 --> 13:39.375
- What?
- I guess I have no choice but
to let the Smith family...

13:39.417 --> 13:42.917
take the Sanders's place
on the space station
for the next year.

13:47.458 --> 13:50.083
We'll be safe in space.
That we know.

14:03.083 --> 14:04.750
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Oh, no! Oh, no!

14:04.792 --> 14:06.458
Oh, no! Oh, no!

14:06.500 --> 14:08.792
Oh, yes.

14:39.458 --> 14:41.333
You think Roger's
still looking for us?

14:41.375 --> 14:44.000
All I know is we don't
have to worry about it
for the next year.

14:44.041 --> 14:47.250
Stan, can you please
just put a jumpsuit on
like the rest of us?

14:47.291 --> 14:49.792
No can do.
Earth Stan is boxers.

14:49.834 --> 14:53.166
Space Stan is panties.
Steve, don't steal glances.

14:53.208 --> 14:56.125
If you want to check out
my meatballs in this thing,
go right ahead. I'm your dad.

14:56.166 --> 14:58.291
Day Three.

14:58.333 --> 15:03.625
Chia Pet 122271:
three and five-eighths growth.

15:03.667 --> 15:05.417
Fascinating.

15:05.458 --> 15:10.291
Permission to apply
Chia Pet Specimen 010874
with alpha paste.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.500
Paste application
approved.

15:12.542 --> 15:15.250
Steady. Well done.

15:15.291 --> 15:18.667
Prepare olfactory system
for flatulence.
Flatulence denied.

15:18.709 --> 15:21.583
Flatulence
has been sent.

15:21.667 --> 15:24.166
Steve, Klaus went to get
more Chia seeds an hour ago.

15:24.208 --> 15:26.500
Go find him.
Aye, aye, Captain.

15:26.542 --> 15:28.375
This isn't a boat.
It is a ship.

15:28.417 --> 15:30.458
Get out.

15:33.291 --> 15:34.375
Klaus?

15:34.417 --> 15:37.166
Klaus, where are you?

15:42.709 --> 15:44.166
Help!
Klaus?

15:46.041 --> 15:48.125
Klaus, it's stuck!
Get away!

15:48.166 --> 15:49.792
It's a trap!
He's here!

15:51.834 --> 15:53.125
Steve! Behind you!

16:00.083 --> 16:02.458
Stan, what's happening?

16:02.500 --> 16:04.542
Not much.
What's happening
with you?

16:04.583 --> 16:07.083
What is that?

16:07.125 --> 16:09.375
Is that Ace of Base?
Roger!

16:09.417 --> 16:12.500
He's here.
He's gonna kill us all.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.750
Steve's still out there.

16:14.792 --> 16:16.959
We have to find him
and get off
this space station.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.291
Let's split up.
Whoever finds him,
radio the others,

16:19.333 --> 16:21.750
and we'll meet up
at the escape pod.

16:21.792 --> 16:25.166
♪ You're not the one for me ♪

16:25.208 --> 16:27.208

16:27.250 --> 16:29.250

We're in the kitchen!

16:51.792 --> 16:54.041
I'm running
as fast as I can!

16:59.667 --> 17:01.458
It's gonna be okay,
Francine.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.709
I made it
to the escape pod.

17:03.750 --> 17:05.917
I'm safe.
What?

17:05.959 --> 17:08.583
Stan, hurry!
We're almost
on the ground!

17:10.458 --> 17:13.500
Oh, God! Oh, God!

17:13.542 --> 17:15.834
Well, I did all I could.

17:51.583 --> 17:53.625
Welcome! And thank you
for coming.

17:53.667 --> 17:56.417
- Are you gonna
kill us now?
- That'd be too easy.

17:56.458 --> 17:59.792
No. You have to feel
the same pain I felt
that night.

17:59.834 --> 18:02.542
So you're gonna
roast us?
No.

18:02.583 --> 18:04.834
You're going
to roast each other.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.667
And your zingers
better be mean.

18:06.709 --> 18:09.959
If you try any weak sauce,
I'm gonna give you
such a zotz.

18:10.917 --> 18:14.208
Now, Stan, roast Hayley.

18:14.250 --> 18:16.375
You feel that zotz?

18:16.417 --> 18:19.917
Hayley, you're not very smart,
and you smoke a lot of pot.

18:19.959 --> 18:21.875
- Zotz!
- Okay.

18:21.917 --> 18:24.208
Hayley, I secretly wish
you were Benjamin Button...

18:24.250 --> 18:26.333
and you were aging backwards
and your life was almost over.

18:26.375 --> 18:28.792
Uh-huh! Oh, yeah!

18:28.834 --> 18:30.792
Insults in the form
of jokes.

18:30.834 --> 18:34.417
How's it feel, Hayley?
Not too bueno, I bet.
Okay, now do Steve.

18:34.458 --> 18:36.875
Steve, you will never
get laid.

18:36.917 --> 18:38.667
There's nothing
attractive about you.

18:38.709 --> 18:41.375
You have the sex appeal
of the cancer ward
in a pediatric hospital.

18:41.417 --> 18:43.625
Oh-ho-ho.

18:43.667 --> 18:46.166
Hayley coming in
with a groaner.
Nice.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.166
Okay, Steve. Let's see you
give it to your mama.

18:50.333 --> 18:52.125
Mom,
you are not smart.

18:52.166 --> 18:54.208
I don't tell
"Yo mama's
so dumb" jokes.

18:54.250 --> 18:57.500
I tell "My mama's
so dumb" jokes.
Example.

18:57.542 --> 19:00.875
My mama's so dumb,
I don't tell
"Yo mama's so dumb" jokes.

19:00.917 --> 19:03.709
I tell "My mama's
so dumb" jokes.

19:03.750 --> 19:07.709
I love it. Francine,
take the pain and throw it
right at Stan. Do it!

19:07.750 --> 19:12.125
Stan, you have
the undeserved ego
of Jeremy Piven,

19:12.166 --> 19:15.333
the annoying
self-righteousness
of Sean Penn...

19:15.375 --> 19:18.792
and the unbearable hypocrisy
of Rush Limbaugh.

19:18.834 --> 19:23.583
What I'm trying to say
is you're almost as bad
a person as Rachael Ray.

19:38.834 --> 19:41.250
Why are you laughing?
That wasn't funny.

19:41.291 --> 19:43.667
That's like the meanest thing
anyone's ever said to anyone.

19:43.709 --> 19:46.291
What the hell's going on here?
Where's the hurt feelings?

19:46.333 --> 19:49.875
Roger, we can say
these things to each other
because we're family.

19:49.917 --> 19:52.542
It doesn't hurt my feelings,
because I still know
they love me.

19:52.583 --> 19:54.458
Well, your roast
hurt my feelings.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.458
Wait a minute.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.291
You don't consider yourself
part of this family, do you?

19:59.333 --> 20:02.166
No. 'Cause I'm not.
Are you kidding me?

20:02.208 --> 20:05.709
We tried to throw you
a bowling party.
We did the roast you wanted.

20:05.750 --> 20:09.542
If after all this time,
you still don't feel part of
this family, it's your hang-up.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.458
Roger, we love you.
You're a Smith.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.667
If you can't accept that,
go-- yourself.

20:14.709 --> 20:18.041
Oh, my God.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.792
I am a part
of this family.

20:20.834 --> 20:24.333
You do love me.
I feel it now.

20:24.375 --> 20:28.166
I'm-- I'm letting it
wash over me.

20:28.208 --> 20:32.583
Look at me.
I'm crying like Francine when
she watches Grey's Anatomy.

20:32.625 --> 20:35.792
I just feel so sorry
for those poor actors.

20:35.834 --> 20:38.500
Hey, Roger.

20:38.542 --> 20:40.875
Go take some Euphoria
and rape the data journal.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.625
I've been eyeing it.
I'm not gonna lie.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.375
Fun birthday.

20:55.625 --> 20:59.250
Hey! Never thought I'd see
you dirty bastards again.

20:59.291 --> 21:01.583
Ah! I feel great,
cleaned out.

21:01.625 --> 21:05.208
All right, who wants 'em next?
No one?

21:05.250 --> 21:07.750
Okay, you heard them.
Round two, boys.

21:07.792 --> 21:10.458
And make sure this time
that you really--

21:10.500 --> 21:12.625
Oh. Oh, you know
what you're doing.

21:45.041 --> 21:46.834
Bye! Have a beautiful time.
