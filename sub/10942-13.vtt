WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:03.336
You have to admit
we're really good together.

00:03.404 --> 00:05.304
Yes, yes we are!

00:07.740 --> 00:09.908
I let Chase put a claim in
on Dexter

00:09.975 --> 00:12.210
and Ty was right there.

00:12.278 --> 00:14.212
Any reason I should worried
about my boyfriend

00:14.280 --> 00:16.915
giving my best friend
such expensive gifts?

00:16.982 --> 00:18.050
It wasn't a gift.

00:18.117 --> 00:19.551
I was gonna do some clinics
with him.

00:19.618 --> 00:21.053
What're you doing?

00:21.120 --> 00:23.320
Amy and I called it quits.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:11.833 --> 01:13.000
<i>Thanks for meeting with me, Amy.</i>

01:13.068 --> 01:14.602
<i>No problem.</i>

01:14.669 --> 01:16.504
I've been selling horses
to police departments

01:16.572 --> 01:18.172
for quite a while now.

01:18.240 --> 01:19.873
I can't seem to keep up
with the demand lately;

01:19.941 --> 01:21.075
that's where you come in.

01:21.143 --> 01:23.211
Well, I'm glad I can help.

01:23.278 --> 01:25.346
I need you to completely
bomb proof these guys for me.

01:25.414 --> 01:26.813
Make sure nothing
can spook them.

01:26.880 --> 01:27.914
You've come to the right place.

01:27.982 --> 01:30.317
I've desensitized
lots of horses.

01:30.384 --> 01:32.085
This here is Legend...

01:33.053 --> 01:34.387
Hey, bud.

01:36.491 --> 01:37.991
Karma and Goliath.

01:38.058 --> 01:39.826
They've spent most of their
lives hauling plows

01:39.893 --> 01:41.161
in a Mennonite colony.

01:41.229 --> 01:43.596
They're pretty sturdy,
so don't go easy on 'em.

01:43.663 --> 01:45.397
So you're dropping off
all three?

01:45.465 --> 01:46.698
That was the plan.

01:46.766 --> 01:47.866
I can take a couple back

01:47.934 --> 01:49.602
if you don't think
you can handle 'em.

01:49.669 --> 01:51.537
No, no, I can handle it.

01:51.605 --> 01:53.905
I can totally handle it,
no problem.

01:53.973 --> 01:55.407
There is no way
I can handle this.

01:55.475 --> 01:56.975
What were you thinking?

01:57.043 --> 01:58.476
Well, I just thought
if I turned him away,

01:58.544 --> 01:59.444
it would be unprofessional.

01:59.512 --> 02:00.678
No, what's unprofessional

02:00.746 --> 02:02.780
is making promises
you can't keep.

02:02.848 --> 02:04.249
I mean maybe if Ty
and Caleb here,

02:04.316 --> 02:05.950
but you're alone.

02:06.018 --> 02:08.152
Alone. Great.
Thanks for reminding me.

02:08.220 --> 02:10.054
That is not what I meant.

02:10.122 --> 02:12.857
You know,
maybe this is an opportunity.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.458
Sometimes you just have
to challenge yourself;

02:14.526 --> 02:15.592
push your own boundaries.

02:15.660 --> 02:16.826
What are you?
A motivational speaker?

02:16.894 --> 02:17.894
You're scaring me.

02:17.962 --> 02:19.229
I'm just trying to be positive.

02:19.297 --> 02:20.430
Aren't you the one

02:20.498 --> 02:21.598
who's always telling me
to be that way?

02:21.666 --> 02:23.800
Hey, I'm all for
positive vibes,

02:23.868 --> 02:26.403
but you have to be
realistic here.

02:28.473 --> 02:29.806
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

02:29.874 --> 02:31.707
I know how much you hate
going into the city.

02:31.775 --> 02:33.008
Are you kidding?
What could be more fun

02:33.076 --> 02:34.343
than hanging out
in a bookstore?

02:34.411 --> 02:35.678
Other than doing my taxes,

02:35.745 --> 02:36.779
or taking a long drive
through the prairies...

02:36.846 --> 02:37.913
Okay, I get it.

02:37.981 --> 02:39.348
We really don't have to go.

02:39.416 --> 02:40.749
No, no, no, I want to.

02:40.817 --> 02:41.784
You're like a kid
in a candy shop

02:41.851 --> 02:43.018
when you're buying books.

02:43.086 --> 02:44.320
Pretty adorable.

02:44.388 --> 02:46.121
Have I told you you're like
the best boyfriend

02:46.189 --> 02:47.189
in the whole world?

02:47.256 --> 02:48.956
Yeah, I kind of am.

02:51.860 --> 02:52.894
All right, you get that.

02:52.961 --> 02:55.263
I'm gonna go grab my stuff.

03:02.571 --> 03:06.407
Well, well, well,
isn't this a surprise.

03:06.474 --> 03:09.009
Uh...
No, I'm not busy today.

03:09.077 --> 03:11.078
I'll be right over.

03:12.013 --> 03:15.015
All right, I'm ready to go.

03:15.950 --> 03:17.184
Um...

03:17.252 --> 03:18.284
Hello?

03:19.587 --> 03:21.053
Is anybody home?

03:21.988 --> 03:24.757
Hey.
Hey. Is Amy here? Or...

03:25.693 --> 03:26.826
She sent me a text message,

03:26.893 --> 03:29.028
said I should come
by the house, so...

03:29.096 --> 03:32.198
Yeah. Yeah,
she left you something.

03:44.844 --> 03:47.112
Did she say anything?
Or...

03:47.179 --> 03:49.948
No. No, I'm sorry, Ty,
she didn't.

04:07.632 --> 04:10.667
Hey, Chase.
Thanks for coming.

04:10.735 --> 04:12.736
I had a feeling we'd be
working together again.

04:12.803 --> 04:13.970
Well, I wouldn't have called,

04:14.037 --> 04:15.372
but I got a little in
over my head.

04:15.439 --> 04:17.240
No, don't worry.
We can totally handle this.

04:17.308 --> 04:19.242
I brought some stuff
to help us finish the job.

04:22.779 --> 04:25.381
Yeah. Looks like you brought
your entire bag of tricks.

04:25.448 --> 04:27.483
Well, there aren't exactly
any riots in Hudson,

04:27.550 --> 04:30.919
so I figured we'd create
a bit of our own urban chaos.

04:30.987 --> 04:32.421
All right.

04:39.861 --> 04:41.529
Hey!

04:45.033 --> 04:46.701
Can you grab these?

04:53.108 --> 04:55.008
Got it?

04:55.075 --> 04:56.242
Where should we set up?

04:56.311 --> 04:58.011
I was thinking
maybe the back pens.

04:58.078 --> 04:59.112
Sounds good.

05:07.822 --> 05:11.724
Well, that wasn't
very friendly, was it?

05:12.759 --> 05:14.927
Come on.
Let's get started.

Hello?

06:14.217 --> 06:16.117
Hey. Uh...

06:16.185 --> 06:18.953
The Hancock's mare
had her foal this morning.

06:19.021 --> 06:20.489
It was a difficult labour.

06:20.556 --> 06:22.657
Could've used your help.

06:22.725 --> 06:24.393
I forgot, Scott.

06:24.460 --> 06:26.395
This is the third time
in a row.

06:26.462 --> 06:28.663
I know, I just, uh...

06:29.599 --> 06:30.998
I've been busy.

06:31.065 --> 06:32.533
You know, I turned down
a lot of other students

06:32.601 --> 06:33.734
who applied for your job.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.438
Well, maybe you'd be better off
with one of them then.

06:38.540 --> 06:40.274
What are you saying?

06:40.341 --> 06:42.309
<i>I don't know what I'm saying.</i>
<i>I just, uh...</i>

06:42.377 --> 06:43.878
Things are sort of complicated
right now,

06:43.945 --> 06:45.212
and, um...

06:45.280 --> 06:47.647
Well, I'd sure hate
to lose you, Ty,

06:47.715 --> 06:50.249
but I need somebody
I can rely on.

06:50.317 --> 06:53.553
So you better make up
your mind.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.429
<i>All right,</i>
<i>just a few more steps.</i>

07:04.731 --> 07:06.565
- Almost there...
- Okay...

07:06.633 --> 07:08.600
You ready?
I'm ready.

07:08.668 --> 07:09.735
Ta da!

07:10.904 --> 07:13.004
Oh my God!

07:13.072 --> 07:14.640
<i>What do you think?</i>

07:14.707 --> 07:16.975
<i>Wow, it's...</i>

07:17.043 --> 07:18.476
<i>Oh my God,</i>
<i>it's incredible.</i>

07:18.544 --> 07:19.510
You like it?

07:19.578 --> 07:21.111
Are you kidding?
Lou, I...

07:21.179 --> 07:23.448
I can't believe
how much work you got done

07:23.515 --> 07:24.549
since I was here last.

07:24.616 --> 07:26.484
Well, I had a lot of help.

07:26.552 --> 07:27.985
I couldn't have done it
without Lisa.

07:28.053 --> 07:30.621
Well, thank you very much,
Lisa.

07:30.689 --> 07:32.690
We wanted to have the crib done
by the time you got here,

07:32.758 --> 07:34.058
but it turned out
to be a little trickier

07:34.125 --> 07:35.224
than we thought.

07:35.292 --> 07:36.560
Guys... wow, honey.

07:37.495 --> 07:38.762
Listen, I would love
to stay and help,

07:38.830 --> 07:39.830
honestly, I would,

07:39.897 --> 07:40.797
but I got a meeting
at the bank.

07:40.865 --> 07:42.098
No, go.

07:42.166 --> 07:44.067
I just...I couldn't wait
to show you.

07:44.134 --> 07:45.034
See you tonight, okay?
Okay.

07:45.102 --> 07:46.202
Okay.

07:46.270 --> 07:47.771
Lisa, thank you, again,
so much.

07:47.839 --> 07:49.739
Hey, don't mention it.

07:49.807 --> 07:51.607
Bye.

07:51.675 --> 07:53.776
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>It came together beautifully.</i>

07:53.844 --> 07:55.711
I feel kind of bad about
how much money it cost.

07:55.779 --> 07:56.846
Don't think about it.

07:56.913 --> 07:58.013
It's worth every penny.

07:58.081 --> 07:59.582
Just think about how much time

07:59.649 --> 08:00.516
you're gonna be spending
in here,

08:00.584 --> 08:02.217
especially during mat leave.

08:02.285 --> 08:03.486
Mat leave?

08:03.553 --> 08:05.488
I'm not taking mat leave.

08:05.555 --> 08:06.721
No?

08:06.789 --> 08:07.589
No.

08:07.656 --> 08:09.123
Oh, I just assumed

08:09.191 --> 08:11.092
that you would be taking
a year off from the dude ranch

08:11.159 --> 08:12.226
after the baby was born.

08:12.294 --> 08:13.995
I might take a few weeks off,

08:14.062 --> 08:16.197
but I won't need a whole year.

08:16.264 --> 08:18.265
Does that mean
you're getting a nanny?

08:18.333 --> 08:20.635
No, I don't think so.

08:20.703 --> 08:23.003
Lou, I mean, between Heartland
and the dude ranch,

08:23.070 --> 08:25.405
it's, it's more than
a full-time job.

08:25.473 --> 08:28.141
Which I will be perfectly
capable of doing

08:28.209 --> 08:30.744
after the baby's born.

08:30.812 --> 08:32.111
Okay.

08:32.179 --> 08:36.015
Okay. Now, uh,
hand me that screwdriver.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.359
Oh, Jack!

08:47.427 --> 08:48.827
Sorry about that.

08:48.895 --> 08:50.261
Scott.
What's the rush?

08:50.329 --> 08:51.796
I'm late for a call.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.264
I just can't seem to keep up.

08:53.332 --> 08:55.133
Well, at least business
is good.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.835
Yeah, sure is.

08:56.903 --> 08:59.170
Ty sure picked a hell of a day
not to show up though.

08:59.238 --> 09:01.339
Oh.
Doesn't sound like Ty.

09:01.407 --> 09:02.507
Yeah.

09:02.575 --> 09:03.842
Normally, I'd agree with you
on that,

09:03.910 --> 09:05.175
but lately...

09:06.110 --> 09:08.311
I don't know what's going on
with that guy.

09:08.379 --> 09:10.014
He was talking about quitting.

09:10.081 --> 09:11.715
Really?

09:11.783 --> 09:13.216
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

09:13.284 --> 09:14.718
Yeah, me too.

09:14.786 --> 09:15.886
Talk to you later.

09:15.954 --> 09:17.120
Yeah.

09:19.958 --> 09:21.323
Hey, Jack.

09:21.391 --> 09:24.827
Um, I probably shouldn't
say anything, but...

09:24.895 --> 09:27.664
Work is not the only thing
Ty’s been skipping out on.

09:27.731 --> 09:29.933
I haven't seen him at school
for the last few weeks.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.100
Are you sure 'bout that?

09:31.168 --> 09:33.202
Pretty big campus isn't it?

09:33.270 --> 09:35.304
Well, it's not that big.

09:41.978 --> 09:43.311
You know, desensitizing
police horses

09:43.379 --> 09:44.913
ain’t exactly horse whispering.

09:44.981 --> 09:46.048
Yeah, I know.

09:46.115 --> 09:47.148
Things might get
a little crazy.

09:47.216 --> 09:48.216
A few balls and a tarp

09:48.284 --> 09:50.351
is hardly what I'd call crazy.

09:50.419 --> 09:51.920
Well, wait 'til
we walk those horses

09:51.988 --> 09:53.821
between these two oil drums.

09:53.889 --> 09:55.723
That doesn't sound
very challenging.

09:55.791 --> 09:57.257
I'm not done yet.

10:02.731 --> 10:04.364
When we're done with all this,

10:04.432 --> 10:06.100
we're gonna walk those horses
through fire.

10:06.167 --> 10:07.468
Are you serious?

10:07.535 --> 10:09.168
Yeah, we gotta prepare 'em
for anything:

10:09.236 --> 10:10.604
Riots, protests,

10:10.671 --> 10:12.205
natural disasters -
you name it.

10:12.272 --> 10:13.607
And if they can't handle
a little bit of fire,

10:13.674 --> 10:16.142
they got no business
being police horses.

10:18.012 --> 10:19.879
Oh, you're not flaming out
on me are you?

10:21.082 --> 10:22.181
No way.

10:36.162 --> 10:39.832
Why are you hanging Scott
out to dry?

10:41.199 --> 10:42.867
It's good to see you too, Jack.

10:42.935 --> 10:44.335
And Soraya seems to think

10:44.402 --> 10:46.137
you're not going to school
either.

10:48.340 --> 10:50.541
I just need some time off.

10:50.609 --> 10:52.343
Well, how much time?

10:54.046 --> 10:55.479
I don't know.

10:55.547 --> 10:56.647
A few weeks.

10:58.883 --> 11:00.316
What about your classes?

11:00.384 --> 11:02.152
I don't know, okay?

11:03.121 --> 11:05.555
I just need some time
to figure some stuff out.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.791
Well, what kind of stuff?

11:09.060 --> 11:12.562
Like maybe this whole vet thing
was a bad idea.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.096
Maybe I don't wanna be here
anymore.

11:14.164 --> 11:16.966
What?
You're just gonna move away?

11:17.034 --> 11:18.500
Maybe. Uh...

11:18.568 --> 11:19.969
I'm gonna stay here
'til Caleb and Ashley get back

11:20.037 --> 11:23.172
from their honeymoon,
and then, um...

11:24.240 --> 11:25.307
And then, I don't know.

11:25.375 --> 11:26.441
I just need some time to think.

11:26.509 --> 11:28.010
Yeah, well,
you better think fast...

11:28.078 --> 11:29.844
With all due respect, Jack,

11:29.912 --> 11:31.112
the day I moved out
of that loft,

11:31.180 --> 11:35.116
my life became
none of your damn business.

11:52.563 --> 11:54.364
<i>All right.</i>

11:54.431 --> 11:56.498
Come on,
through the curtains here.

11:56.566 --> 11:57.799
Good job, Karma.

11:58.768 --> 12:01.002
Alrighty.
There you go.

12:01.070 --> 12:02.170
<i>All right.</i>

12:04.006 --> 12:05.574
<i>Come on, Legend.</i>

12:05.642 --> 12:07.343
<i>It's okay,</i>
<i>it's okay.</i>

12:07.410 --> 12:10.979
It's all right.
Legend, come on, let's go.

12:12.781 --> 12:13.948
Come on, Amy,

12:14.015 --> 12:15.416
you gotta push him harder
than that.

12:15.484 --> 12:18.253
Well, I'm not gonna
force him, all right?

12:18.320 --> 12:20.154
These things take time.

12:20.222 --> 12:21.356
These other two horses

12:21.423 --> 12:22.557
went through the curtains
just fine.

12:22.625 --> 12:24.626
That guy's way too much
of a squirrel.

12:24.693 --> 12:26.561
Chase, I can get him
to go through, all right?

12:26.629 --> 12:27.794
So just relax.

12:27.862 --> 12:29.730
I am relaxed.

12:29.797 --> 12:31.231
But you're the one
with the reputation on the line,

12:31.299 --> 12:32.366
<i>not me.</i>

12:54.888 --> 12:56.222
Jack?

12:56.290 --> 12:57.490
Well, come on, get your stuff.

12:57.558 --> 12:59.225
You and me,
we're going on a road trip.

12:59.292 --> 13:01.026
- A road trip?
- Yeah.

13:01.094 --> 13:02.127
You're joking, right?

13:02.195 --> 13:04.430
Does it look like I'm joking?

13:04.497 --> 13:05.831
Where'd you get the bike?

13:05.898 --> 13:09.134
I borrowed it.
Now, come on, get your stuff.

13:09.202 --> 13:11.704
No, I'm not going anywhere.

13:20.779 --> 13:22.647
What do you want from me, Jack?

13:22.715 --> 13:24.082
I wanna know what happened
to the guy

13:24.149 --> 13:26.585
who used to live up in my loft?

13:26.652 --> 13:28.786
Amy and I broke up

13:28.854 --> 13:31.155
and we're not getting
back together.

13:31.190 --> 13:32.223
Yeah, well,

13:32.291 --> 13:33.424
we're not talking
about Amy here;

13:33.492 --> 13:34.659
we're talking about you.

13:34.726 --> 13:35.893
Well, I don't wanna talk
about me,

13:35.960 --> 13:38.429
so maybe you should just go.

13:38.497 --> 13:41.199
Oh! Aw, I've got all day.

13:42.568 --> 13:44.302
If we're not gonna go
on our little road trip,

13:44.369 --> 13:48.238
well, I'll just hang out here
with you.

13:48.306 --> 13:51.275
Hey, you got any food?
I am starving.

13:51.342 --> 13:53.043
Maybe you could whip us up
a couple of grilled cheese;

13:53.110 --> 13:54.611
that'd be good.

13:55.580 --> 13:57.181
Put on some music.

13:58.115 --> 14:00.184
Hey, do you think Caleb's
got any Dolly Parton?

14:00.251 --> 14:04.454
I love Dolly.
I could listen to her all day.

14:14.498 --> 14:15.632
Fine.

14:18.802 --> 14:20.369
Let's go.
Come on.

14:22.639 --> 14:24.873
<i>So it looks like we have</i>
<i>three couples checking in,</i>

14:24.941 --> 14:27.743
and the Davidson's are bringing
<i>their grandson...</i>

14:27.810 --> 14:29.245
- Again.
- Uh huh.

14:29.312 --> 14:31.280
The one who's
allergic to everything.

14:31.348 --> 14:33.749
Okay.
So no nuts or dairy for breakfast.

14:33.816 --> 14:35.350
- Yes.
- And...

14:35.418 --> 14:37.385
- A hypoallergenic pillow.
- Of course.

14:37.453 --> 14:38.520
Cabin three.

14:38.588 --> 14:41.723
Um, you know,
there's one more thing.

14:41.790 --> 14:43.891
I was thinking a lot about
our discussion yesterday...

14:43.959 --> 14:45.693
about me running the dude ranch

14:45.761 --> 14:47.229
after I have the baby.

14:47.296 --> 14:50.198
And I want you to know
that I'm gonna make it work,

14:50.266 --> 14:51.132
so you don't have to worry.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.567
Mm-hm.

14:52.634 --> 14:54.068
I had an idea.

14:54.136 --> 14:55.836
Why don't we bring Soraya in
full-time next summer

14:55.904 --> 14:58.206
and then you just have more
flexibility with your days.

14:58.273 --> 15:00.774
Right, but I don't see how
we can afford Soraya full-time.

15:00.842 --> 15:03.611
I mean, we can hardly afford her
part-time as it is, right?

15:03.678 --> 15:06.547
Frankly, I don't know
how we can afford not to.

15:06.615 --> 15:08.615
Okay, just because
I'm having a baby

15:08.683 --> 15:10.750
doesn't mean
I'm suddenly useless.

15:10.818 --> 15:13.220
Look, your life is changing
in a huge way,

15:13.288 --> 15:14.555
and you kinda need to accept

15:14.622 --> 15:15.855
that you can't do everything
on your own.

15:15.923 --> 15:17.591
How do you know what my life
is going to be like?

15:17.658 --> 15:20.427
I don't even know what my life
is going to be like yet.

15:20.495 --> 15:22.162
I mean, maybe if you had
kids of your own,

15:22.230 --> 15:24.297
but you don't.

15:24.365 --> 15:25.831
Right, so...

15:25.899 --> 15:27.800
How could I possibly know
what I'm talking about.

15:27.868 --> 15:29.769
Lisa, that's not...
Lisa...

15:30.737 --> 15:32.305
That is not what I meant.

15:32.373 --> 15:33.873
That's all right.
Let's talk about it later.

15:45.585 --> 15:48.720
<i>Legend, come on,</i>
<i>let's go.</i>

15:49.689 --> 15:50.822
Hey.

15:50.890 --> 15:52.691
Come on, Amy,
he's a lost cause.

15:52.758 --> 15:54.560
Matthew hired me
to train three horses,

15:54.627 --> 15:56.027
not two.

15:56.095 --> 15:57.328
No, Matthew hired you
to turn to these plow horses

15:57.396 --> 15:58.930
into police horses,

15:58.997 --> 16:00.432
and if that guy's
not up to the task,

16:00.499 --> 16:02.333
then there's no sense
wasting his money

16:02.401 --> 16:03.801
training a dud.

16:03.869 --> 16:05.703
So what am I supposed to do,
give up on him?

16:05.771 --> 16:07.305
Some horses just aren't meant
to be police horses.

16:07.373 --> 16:09.174
It's simple as that.

16:10.142 --> 16:11.175
Maybe you're right.

16:11.243 --> 16:12.809
'Course I'm right.

16:12.877 --> 16:14.045
Now why don't we put him
in the barn

16:14.112 --> 16:15.846
and concentrate
on the other two.

16:15.914 --> 16:17.648
Okay.

16:17.715 --> 16:19.283
Come on, bud.

16:45.842 --> 16:47.643
Whoa, whoa!

16:47.710 --> 16:50.212
Easy, easy, easy...

16:59.855 --> 17:01.056
All right.

17:01.124 --> 17:02.891
Well, these two are doing
real good.

17:02.958 --> 17:03.825
I think we should take 'em
for a walk

17:03.893 --> 17:05.193
by the highway tomorrow.

17:05.261 --> 17:06.661
Get them used
to being around traffic.

17:06.729 --> 17:08.630
All right.
Sounds good.

17:08.696 --> 17:11.366
What do you say, boss,
we all done for the day?

17:11.434 --> 17:13.502
Yeah, I think these guys
have had enough.

17:27.483 --> 17:28.649
Why are we stopping?

17:28.717 --> 17:31.251
Well, it's the end of the road,

17:31.319 --> 17:32.752
or maybe the beginning.

17:32.820 --> 17:35.389
Depends on how you look at it.

17:35.457 --> 17:36.823
Oh, that's deep, Jack.

17:36.891 --> 17:39.460
Just hush up and listen.

17:40.428 --> 17:44.664
I brought you out here
to make you an offer.

17:46.434 --> 17:47.533
What kind of offer?

17:47.601 --> 17:48.935
An offer that's gonna
change your life,

17:49.003 --> 17:51.938
whether you take it or not.

17:52.006 --> 17:54.107
Oh, this should be good.

17:55.042 --> 18:00.280
I'm offering you the chance
to move back into the loft.

18:00.348 --> 18:01.714
You brought me all the way
out here

18:01.782 --> 18:03.549
to ask if I wanted to move
back into the loft?

18:03.616 --> 18:05.884
I'm not finished yet.

18:06.820 --> 18:08.654
There'd two conditions.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.856
One, you get back on track
at school,

18:10.924 --> 18:13.692
and two, you work for Scott.

18:13.760 --> 18:17.596
Wow, that's tempting, Jack,

18:17.664 --> 18:19.897
especially with
those conditions attached,

18:19.966 --> 18:22.434
but I'm gonna have to pass.

18:23.402 --> 18:24.469
Well,

18:25.804 --> 18:27.372
if you're not coming back
to the loft,

18:27.440 --> 18:29.707
then do me a favour:

18:31.110 --> 18:32.510
Shove off.

18:35.247 --> 18:36.380
Take that road to the highway,

18:36.448 --> 18:38.082
see where you end up.

18:38.150 --> 18:39.083
Maybe the grass'll be greener,

18:39.151 --> 18:40.084
maybe it won't.

18:40.152 --> 18:41.152
Maybe it'll just be hell,

18:41.219 --> 18:43.520
but at least
you'll be moving on.

18:43.588 --> 18:47.024
Why would I do that?
Because I just spent the last three years

18:47.092 --> 18:48.359
watching you get your life
together.

18:48.427 --> 18:50.127
I'm not about to watch you
throw it all away.

18:50.195 --> 18:52.495
I can't, and I won't.

18:53.798 --> 18:55.632
You got overnight
to think about it.

18:55.699 --> 18:57.000
If you don't show up
at the ranch

18:57.068 --> 18:59.303
by tomorrow morning,

19:01.505 --> 19:03.840
don't show up at all.

19:50.919 --> 19:52.653
So, uh...

19:52.720 --> 19:53.787
Hey, listen.
Soraya and I,

19:53.855 --> 19:55.055
we're going to a movie later.

19:55.122 --> 19:56.423
You want to come with us?

19:56.490 --> 19:57.824
Uh...

19:57.891 --> 19:59.625
No, thank you though.

19:59.693 --> 20:01.794
Why?
You got other plans?

20:01.862 --> 20:04.397
I'd just rather not be
the third wheel.

20:04.465 --> 20:05.798
Well, it beats sitting
around at home

20:05.866 --> 20:09.069
moping about that guy
that used to live here.

20:09.136 --> 20:10.970
For your information,

20:11.037 --> 20:13.672
I am so done with the moping.

20:13.739 --> 20:14.840
Good.

20:14.907 --> 20:16.075
Then come out with us tonight.

20:16.142 --> 20:18.944
Have some fun for a change.

20:20.713 --> 20:23.615
Come on, you know you wanna.

21:18.534 --> 21:19.401
Oh my God.

21:28.677 --> 21:30.211
You're kidding me.

21:31.880 --> 21:34.015
Hey, guys.
You all right?

21:38.387 --> 21:39.754
Look at you.

21:39.822 --> 21:42.856
What?
You look amazing. Got a date?

21:42.925 --> 21:46.160
No, just going to the movies
with soraya...

21:46.228 --> 21:47.494
And Chase.

21:47.562 --> 21:48.529
And Chase?

21:48.596 --> 21:49.797
Yeah.

21:49.864 --> 21:51.698
That sounds... complicated.

21:51.766 --> 21:53.234
It's not complicated.
Okay?

21:53.302 --> 21:55.236
There's no rule that says
we can't just be friends.

21:55.304 --> 21:57.371
You're right, there is no rule.

21:57.438 --> 21:58.805
You know, after all
this drama with Ty,

21:58.873 --> 22:00.807
I just wanna go out
and have some fun for a change.

22:00.875 --> 22:02.276
Well, I think
that's a great idea.

22:02.343 --> 22:06.780
Just don't get too taken
by the thrill of the chase.

22:06.847 --> 22:08.282
I'm butting out.

22:08.349 --> 22:10.050
Just go have fun.

22:10.118 --> 22:12.119
Careful, cautious fun.

22:13.053 --> 22:14.287
Lou.

22:14.354 --> 22:16.022
Butting out.
Butting out.

22:30.270 --> 22:32.871
Aw, come on.

23:06.371 --> 23:08.005
Wow...

23:08.073 --> 23:09.639
You clean up pretty good.

23:09.707 --> 23:11.909
Thanks.
Where's soraya?

23:11.977 --> 23:14.444
Oh, soraya can't make it,
actually.

23:14.512 --> 23:15.612
What happened?

23:15.680 --> 23:17.247
Something about studying
for a test.

23:17.315 --> 23:21.051
It looks like
it's just the two of us.

23:22.386 --> 23:23.954
Amy, wait up.

23:24.021 --> 23:25.288
Chase, maybe we should do this
another night,

23:25.356 --> 23:27.123
when soraya can come.

23:27.191 --> 23:28.691
You know what your problem is?

23:28.759 --> 23:30.360
No, I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

23:31.262 --> 23:33.028
You carry the weight
of the world around with you.

23:33.096 --> 23:34.363
You're always so serious
all the time.

23:34.430 --> 23:35.430
Would it kill you

23:35.498 --> 23:36.966
to have just
a little bit of fun

23:37.033 --> 23:38.067
every now and then?

23:38.134 --> 23:39.134
You know what?
I have lots of fun.

23:39.202 --> 23:41.536
Okay, my whole life
is non-stop fun.

23:41.604 --> 23:43.005
Yeah right.

23:43.073 --> 23:44.740
When was the last time
you had actual fun...

23:44.807 --> 23:47.910
that didn't involve
working with a horse?

23:47.978 --> 23:49.510
That's what I thought.

23:49.578 --> 23:50.645
So, come on,

23:50.713 --> 23:51.713
this is your chance
to change that.

23:51.780 --> 23:53.715
Let's go eat too much popcorn

23:53.782 --> 23:55.116
and put our feet up
on the seats

23:55.184 --> 23:57.252
and annoy the people
in front of us and...

23:57.320 --> 23:58.686
We could even go see
one of those vampire movies

23:58.754 --> 24:00.989
you girls like so much.

24:01.958 --> 24:03.859
What do you say?

24:32.447 --> 24:34.123
Who the hell are you?

24:40.931 --> 24:42.648
Hey. Look, I just...

24:42.768 --> 24:45.370
<i>I found these guys</i>
<i>on the side of the road.</i>

24:45.766 --> 24:47.166
Whoa, wait, what're you doing?

24:47.234 --> 24:50.103
What do you think I'm doing?

24:50.170 --> 24:51.570
Look, they're in really
rough shape, okay?

24:51.639 --> 24:52.571
I didn't know what else to do.

24:52.640 --> 24:53.706
Could you...
Please,

24:53.774 --> 24:55.207
you don't have
to call the cops.

24:59.679 --> 25:01.379
Fine.

25:01.447 --> 25:03.048
But you see this?
It's pepper spray.

25:03.116 --> 25:04.783
If you make one wrong move,
I will use it.

25:04.851 --> 25:07.385
Do you understand?
Okay, fair enough.

25:26.806 --> 25:27.806
Where did you learn
to administer

25:27.873 --> 25:28.907
subcutaneous fluids?

25:28.975 --> 25:31.576
I used to work for a vet.

25:33.244 --> 25:34.645
Look, I should probably
get going.

25:34.713 --> 25:37.381
Uh, no, you're not
going anywhere.

25:37.449 --> 25:40.585
<i>You see this nasal discharge?</i>
<i>It's a sure sign of infection.</i>

25:40.652 --> 25:41.919
These guys are gonna need
antibiotics,

25:41.987 --> 25:44.722
and I'm gonna need
another set of hands.

25:44.790 --> 25:45.856
You're it.

25:53.130 --> 25:53.964
Hi.

25:54.031 --> 25:55.098
Hi.

25:57.401 --> 26:00.503
Lisa, I feel terrible about
what I said earlier.

26:00.571 --> 26:02.472
Don't, it's fine.

26:02.539 --> 26:03.873
I was upset

26:03.941 --> 26:04.974
and, you know, the truth is

26:05.042 --> 26:06.375
sometimes I forget
the dude ranch

26:06.443 --> 26:08.110
is your business too.

26:08.178 --> 26:09.244
I blame it on baby brain.

26:09.312 --> 26:12.648
You can't imagine
what it's like.

26:14.117 --> 26:15.350
That came out wrong.

26:15.418 --> 26:16.986
Look, Lou...

26:18.455 --> 26:19.588
One point, yes,

26:19.655 --> 26:20.388
I thought I was gonna have kids

26:20.456 --> 26:22.156
when I was with Dan...

26:22.224 --> 26:23.725
It just didn't happen.

26:23.793 --> 26:25.359
And then after the divorce
I thought, "you know what?

26:25.427 --> 26:27.495
I like my life
just the way it is."

26:27.563 --> 26:30.065
And I still do.
I love it.

26:30.132 --> 26:32.266
I don't have kids.

26:32.334 --> 26:33.969
But I don't make
any apologies for it.

26:34.036 --> 26:35.036
Nor should you.

26:35.104 --> 26:36.336
I'm the one
who should apologize.

26:36.404 --> 26:38.472
Lou, please don't.

26:57.587 --> 26:58.887
So if these guys survive,

26:58.955 --> 27:00.889
what do you plan on
doing with them?

27:00.957 --> 27:01.957
I don't know.

27:02.025 --> 27:02.891
I hadn't really thought
about it.

27:02.959 --> 27:05.027
Well, they can't stay here.

27:05.095 --> 27:06.895
I mean, it's a clinic,
it's not an animal shelter.

27:06.963 --> 27:08.096
Well, I don't know
what you expect me to do.

27:08.164 --> 27:09.564
I don't live around here, so.

27:09.631 --> 27:12.900
Where did you say
you were from?

27:12.969 --> 27:14.302
At least that's where
I used to live.

27:14.370 --> 27:15.437
And you're a student?

27:15.504 --> 27:17.538
Yeah.
Um... well, no.

27:17.606 --> 27:19.007
Not anymore.

27:19.075 --> 27:20.842
I was planning on
going to vet school,

27:20.909 --> 27:22.944
but I can't seem to get through
the first year science, so...

27:24.846 --> 27:26.414
Oh, excuse me.

27:27.316 --> 27:29.216
Hi, Mrs. Healey.

27:30.352 --> 27:33.287
Yes, I'm sorry,
I got stuck at the clinic.

27:33.355 --> 27:34.588
What?

27:35.657 --> 27:38.192
Okay, look, I will be there
as soon as I can.

27:38.260 --> 27:39.660
I'm sorry.

27:41.396 --> 27:43.964
Well, thanks to you,
I have a very angry babysitter

27:44.032 --> 27:45.665
and a three year-old
who somehow managed

27:45.733 --> 27:49.169
<i>to lock himself</i>
<i>inside the bathroom.</i>

27:49.237 --> 27:50.337
Sorry.

27:56.010 --> 27:57.810
I hope I don't regret this.

27:57.878 --> 27:59.178
I'm gonna make you a deal.

27:59.246 --> 28:01.614
You don't have anywhere
to stay, right?

28:01.681 --> 28:04.217
So, you might as well
just spend the night here,

28:04.285 --> 28:06.386
looking after these guys.

28:06.453 --> 28:07.853
And if they make it
through the night,

28:07.922 --> 28:09.555
then I promise I will
find homes

28:09.623 --> 28:11.291
for all three of them.

28:11.358 --> 28:12.591
Sure. Okay.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.427
Um, remember to stay awake.

28:15.495 --> 28:16.628
I'll stay awake.

28:16.696 --> 28:18.297
These guys need milk
every two hours,

28:18.365 --> 28:20.266
and this guy
has to stay on fluids.

28:20.333 --> 28:21.733
Okay.
Okay?

28:21.801 --> 28:23.335
I'll be back in the morning.

28:23.403 --> 28:26.171
And I'll see how they're doing.

28:27.673 --> 28:29.307
Um... hey,

28:29.375 --> 28:33.278
<i>thank you for trusting me</i>
<i>and not calling the cops.</i>

28:33.346 --> 28:34.612
For all you knew,
I could've been some psycho

28:34.680 --> 28:36.014
off the street, so...

28:36.082 --> 28:38.416
Yes, it's a risk,
but from what I understand,

28:38.484 --> 28:40.385
psychos don't usually
rescue puppies

28:40.452 --> 28:42.287
from the side of the road.

28:45.824 --> 28:46.891
Good night, Ty.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.125
<i>Good night.</i>

28:48.193 --> 28:49.260
Good luck.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.064
There you go, buddy.

28:58.036 --> 28:59.370
I had fun tonight.

28:59.437 --> 29:00.871
Me too.

29:00.938 --> 29:02.672
We always have fun though,
don't we?

29:02.740 --> 29:04.274
Yeah.

29:04.342 --> 29:05.475
You ever noticed
when we're working,

29:05.542 --> 29:06.709
it doesn't even feel like work?

29:07.912 --> 29:09.112
You're right, it doesn't.

29:09.180 --> 29:13.016
It's like I know exactly
what you're thinking.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.150
Chase...

29:15.052 --> 29:16.886
What?

29:16.954 --> 29:18.520
I should go.

29:20.757 --> 29:24.160
Then why aren't you leaving?

29:24.228 --> 29:26.262
We can't do this.

29:26.330 --> 29:27.529
Do what?

29:29.166 --> 29:32.134
You're dating my best friend.

29:32.202 --> 29:34.102
And if I wasn't?

29:36.539 --> 29:38.773
This was a bad idea.

29:40.009 --> 29:44.012
Amy, we can't keep
avoiding what's happening here.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.447
You know what?

29:46.382 --> 29:48.182
I don't think we should
work together anymore.

29:48.250 --> 29:49.217
What about the police horses?

29:49.284 --> 29:51.219
We've got a lot of work to do.

29:51.286 --> 29:53.520
Chase, you're fired.

29:54.489 --> 29:57.458
You can't fire Chase Powers.

29:57.525 --> 29:58.659
I quit!

30:43.002 --> 30:44.036
Hello?

30:44.971 --> 30:46.438
Amy.

30:46.505 --> 30:47.672
Ty.

30:47.740 --> 30:49.107
<i>This a bad time?</i>

30:49.175 --> 30:50.775
No.

30:50.844 --> 30:52.877
I didn't know
who else to call, so.

30:52.945 --> 30:54.578
Is everything all right?

30:54.646 --> 30:56.480
Yeah. Um...

30:56.548 --> 30:59.450
I've just been having
a bit of a weird night.

30:59.518 --> 31:00.985
Me too.

31:05.024 --> 31:07.425
Ty, what is going on?

31:07.492 --> 31:09.392
I screwed everything up.

31:09.460 --> 31:11.094
What?

31:11.162 --> 31:13.330
<i>School, our relationship,</i>
<i>everything. I...</i>

31:13.397 --> 31:15.799
I couldn't even keep
a stupid puppy alive.

31:15.867 --> 31:18.268
What are you talking about?
What puppy?

31:18.336 --> 31:20.137
Ty, where are you?

31:21.039 --> 31:22.439
I shouldn't have called.
Uh...

31:22.506 --> 31:23.807
No, wait.

31:23.874 --> 31:25.107
Just tell me where you are
and I'll come meet you.

31:25.175 --> 31:27.710
No, you can't.
It's too far.

31:27.777 --> 31:31.814
What do you mean?
When're you coming back?

31:31.882 --> 31:32.982
<i>Ty?</i>

31:35.319 --> 31:36.685
You're not, are you?

31:36.753 --> 31:38.687
<i>I think I need to start over.</i>

31:38.755 --> 31:39.955
I've made a lot of mistakes.

31:40.023 --> 31:41.256
No, you always do this.

31:41.324 --> 31:43.358
Whenever things get hard,
you just run away.

31:43.426 --> 31:44.759
You're the one
who put my stuff in a box,

31:44.828 --> 31:46.228
like you wanted me to go away.

31:46.296 --> 31:48.396
<i>What was I supposed to do?</i>

31:48.464 --> 31:49.932
I was just trying to move on.

31:49.999 --> 31:53.168
I thought it would
make things easier.

31:53.236 --> 31:54.837
Did it work?

31:56.405 --> 31:57.505
No.

32:03.078 --> 32:04.612
I gotta go.

32:24.232 --> 32:26.066
Lou.

32:26.134 --> 32:27.734
Honey, what're you doing?

32:27.802 --> 32:28.968
You know what it is?

32:29.036 --> 32:30.703
This says that we need
eight barrel nuts,

32:30.771 --> 32:32.138
and we only have six.

32:32.206 --> 32:33.439
So how am I supposed
to finish the crib

32:33.507 --> 32:34.941
with six barrel nuts?

32:35.009 --> 32:37.844
Honey, why don't we go
to the hardware store

32:37.912 --> 32:39.913
in the morning, okay?

32:39.980 --> 32:42.415
Come to bed, sweetheart.

32:42.482 --> 32:44.416
I'm a horrible human being.

32:44.484 --> 32:47.153
I said something to Lisa
and now she hates me.

32:47.220 --> 32:49.021
I'm sure you two
will work it out.

32:49.089 --> 32:50.689
You know, the thing is
that she's right.

32:50.757 --> 32:52.792
It makes perfect sense
to hire soraya full-time

32:52.859 --> 32:54.359
next summer.

32:55.228 --> 32:57.496
I just can't help feeling like
I'm being declared surplus

32:57.563 --> 32:59.231
in my own business.

32:59.299 --> 33:02.734
Well, I don't think Lisa
would do that.

33:02.802 --> 33:05.670
And you know, honey, um...

33:05.738 --> 33:07.639
Lisa's not just
your business partner.

33:07.706 --> 33:09.507
All right?
She's family.

33:09.575 --> 33:10.641
And you never know

33:10.709 --> 33:11.475
when you might need
to lean on family

33:11.543 --> 33:13.845
when things get tough.

33:13.912 --> 33:16.147
Are things getting tough?

33:16.215 --> 33:18.249
Hmm? No.
No, no, no, it's...

33:18.316 --> 33:19.250
No, that's not what I'm saying.

33:19.317 --> 33:20.718
I just...

33:20.786 --> 33:24.155
Um... you never know
what's gonna happen, right?

33:24.223 --> 33:27.091
And it's just good to know
that Lisa's in our corner.

33:27.158 --> 33:28.726
That's all.

33:28.793 --> 33:29.893
Yeah.

33:30.995 --> 33:33.897
Now... come to bed.

33:33.965 --> 33:36.200
Okay.

33:44.875 --> 33:47.243
These two are doing
really well.

33:47.311 --> 33:49.545
You did a great job.

33:53.483 --> 33:54.818
You know we can't
save every animal

33:54.885 --> 33:57.120
that walks through that door.

33:57.188 --> 33:58.721
Yeah, right.

33:58.789 --> 34:00.455
The one you lost,
he was the runt of the litter

34:00.523 --> 34:03.225
and there was really nothing
you could've done.

34:07.064 --> 34:09.165
I better get going.

34:10.766 --> 34:13.735
Well, you guys be good, okay?

34:15.741 --> 34:17.308
Find 'em a good home.

34:17.375 --> 34:18.943
Listen, Ty.

34:19.011 --> 34:21.478
I'm looking for an assistant
at the clinic.

34:21.545 --> 34:22.714
The position wouldn't pay much,

34:22.781 --> 34:26.050
but it would be enough
for you to get by.

34:26.118 --> 34:28.252
And I know Nelson lake
is a really small town,

34:28.320 --> 34:30.821
but there are worse places
for you to call home.

34:30.889 --> 34:32.755
U-um...

34:33.692 --> 34:35.659
I don't know what to say.

34:35.726 --> 34:36.827
Well, think about it

34:36.895 --> 34:40.530
and give me a call
when you've decided.

34:42.100 --> 34:44.534
You're looking
for a fresh start, right?

34:44.601 --> 34:46.335
This could be it.

34:46.404 --> 34:47.771
Thank you.

34:48.839 --> 34:50.473
You bet.
Thank you.

34:50.541 --> 34:51.675
See ya.

34:54.812 --> 34:56.846
Where are you going, hey?

34:56.914 --> 34:59.582
Why? Why are you barking
so loud, hey?

35:05.922 --> 35:07.222
Your coffee's getting cold.

35:07.290 --> 35:09.324
Yeah, sorry.
I...

35:10.627 --> 35:13.262
I'm just, you know,
thinking about all the work

35:13.329 --> 35:15.665
that needs to be done
before winter and...

35:15.732 --> 35:16.932
So you haven't been
standing here all morning

35:17.000 --> 35:18.433
waiting for Ty to come home?

35:18.501 --> 35:19.935
Is it that obvious?

35:20.003 --> 35:21.069
Mm-hmm.

35:23.472 --> 35:26.642
I guess I woke up
with a bad feeling.

35:26.709 --> 35:28.710
You did what you could;
What you thought was right,

35:28.778 --> 35:30.278
and now you just have
to leave it up to him.

35:30.346 --> 35:32.014
Yeah, I know.

35:33.082 --> 35:35.449
I can't help thinking
that I pushed him too hard.

35:35.517 --> 35:38.987
I should've left
well enough alone.

36:31.554 --> 36:33.021
Hello, Dr. Burton.

36:33.956 --> 36:35.190
I'm good, thanks.

36:35.258 --> 36:37.392
Um, I've made a decision
about the job.

36:39.928 --> 36:42.997
I told him that we wouldn't
be working together anymore.

36:43.065 --> 36:45.600
Soraya, I'm so sorry.
I...

36:45.668 --> 36:47.268
I don't know what else to say.

36:47.336 --> 36:49.103
Yeah, neither do I.

36:49.171 --> 36:50.572
When Chase said
you couldn't come to the movie,

36:50.639 --> 36:53.507
I should've just gone home.

36:53.575 --> 36:55.042
What movie?

36:55.644 --> 36:59.012
When you were studying,
last night.

36:59.914 --> 37:01.549
Oh, soraya, I'm...

37:02.517 --> 37:03.684
I never meant...

37:03.752 --> 37:05.252
I didn't know that...

37:05.320 --> 37:06.687
Soraya...

37:19.801 --> 37:21.167
<i>Hey.</i>

37:21.235 --> 37:22.302
Hi.

37:23.304 --> 37:25.037
Um...

37:25.105 --> 37:28.474
Lisa, Peter and I wanted
to ask you something.

37:28.542 --> 37:30.176
Okay.

37:30.243 --> 37:33.746
Look, I know you and I haven't
exactly seen eye to eye lately.

37:33.814 --> 37:35.181
Lou, if this is about
yesterday,

37:35.248 --> 37:36.916
honestly, I'm so over that.

37:36.983 --> 37:39.118
It is about yesterday,
but it's also...

37:39.186 --> 37:40.819
It's about the future.

37:40.887 --> 37:43.355
<i>You've been so good</i>
<i>to Lou and I,</i>

37:43.423 --> 37:44.690
and we were saying,

37:44.758 --> 37:46.692
we wouldn't even have met
if it wasn't for you.

37:46.760 --> 37:48.093
Yeah, exactly.

37:48.161 --> 37:50.228
And you've been a huge part
of our life

37:50.297 --> 37:52.364
and we're hoping
you'll also be a huge part

37:52.432 --> 37:53.599
of our child's life.

37:53.667 --> 37:55.267
Well, of course I will.

37:55.301 --> 37:58.002
Good. Because Peter
and I were hoping

37:58.070 --> 38:02.006
that you would be
the godmother to our baby.

38:02.074 --> 38:03.141
Really?

38:03.208 --> 38:04.242
Yeah.

38:06.111 --> 38:07.845
Well, there is nothing
that I would love more.

38:14.719 --> 38:15.786
Thank you.

38:19.691 --> 38:21.558
So, I hope you don't mind
being the baby's favourite aunt.

38:23.161 --> 38:24.561
Lisa is the perfect choice.

38:24.629 --> 38:26.863
That kid is gonna be
so spoiled.

38:26.931 --> 38:27.964
I know.

38:29.833 --> 38:31.768
So how are things going
with the police horses?

38:31.835 --> 38:33.836
Terrible.

38:33.904 --> 38:35.972
You were right about Chase.

38:36.039 --> 38:37.907
I can't believe I thought
it would be a good idea

38:37.975 --> 38:38.742
to work with him.

38:38.809 --> 38:40.243
He's just a total jerk.

38:40.311 --> 38:42.078
What happened?

38:42.146 --> 38:45.281
Well, I guess "thrill
of the chase" got tiring.

38:45.349 --> 38:46.716
Not only that,

38:46.783 --> 38:48.884
I got a really weird call
from Ty last night.

38:48.952 --> 38:52.622
Lou, he said he's moving away
and he's not coming back.

38:52.689 --> 38:54.790
What?
I mean, I think it's all my fault.

38:54.858 --> 38:57.126
Why'd I have to go
and put his stuff in that box?

38:57.193 --> 38:59.595
It's just so stupid.

38:59.662 --> 39:01.263
Amy, breathe.

39:02.198 --> 39:03.765
It's going to be okay.

39:03.833 --> 39:06.201
I don't think it is.

39:06.269 --> 39:08.570
I just feel like everything
is out of control.

39:08.638 --> 39:11.005
You know that feeling
you have right now?

39:11.073 --> 39:13.442
It's called growing up
and it sucks.

39:13.509 --> 39:14.909
I know.

39:15.977 --> 39:19.514
But things just have a way
of working themselves out.

39:19.582 --> 39:20.848
I promise.

39:20.916 --> 39:21.949
When?

39:28.624 --> 39:30.325
Maybe sooner than you think.

39:31.826 --> 39:33.394
<i>Now that you're the godmother,</i>

39:33.461 --> 39:36.163
<i>don't go thinking you have</i>
<i>to spend gobs of money</i>

39:36.231 --> 39:37.531
on baby gifts.

39:37.599 --> 39:39.966
That is exactly
what I'm going to do.

39:45.139 --> 39:47.507
Come here, there's something
you should see.

39:58.653 --> 40:02.255
I guess whatever you said
worked.

40:02.323 --> 40:04.190
I can't remember the last time

40:04.291 --> 40:05.391
I felt so relieved.

40:08.928 --> 40:12.298
How's Amy gonna deal with Ty
moving back into the loft?

40:12.366 --> 40:15.734
Oh, they'll figure it out.
They always do.

40:15.802 --> 40:17.203
Come here.

40:26.779 --> 40:29.047
Jack said I could move back
into the loft.

40:29.114 --> 40:31.183
I thought
you were leaving town.

40:32.685 --> 40:34.586
I changed my mind.

40:34.654 --> 40:35.686
Oh.

40:39.791 --> 40:40.924
So how is this gonna work,

40:40.992 --> 40:44.061
you and I living
on the same ranch?

40:44.996 --> 40:46.330
I don't know.

40:46.398 --> 40:46.964
I mean, I could find
another place in town,

40:47.032 --> 40:48.166
if it's easier.

40:48.233 --> 40:50.768
No. The loft's free.

40:50.835 --> 40:53.837
Someone might as well use it.

40:56.707 --> 40:58.442
So what's that guy's story?

40:58.510 --> 41:00.977
Ah... Legend.

41:02.514 --> 41:04.080
I'm supposed to be training him
as a police horse,

41:04.149 --> 41:07.117
but Chase thinks
he's too skittish.

41:07.985 --> 41:09.085
Chase.

41:10.654 --> 41:12.355
How's that going?

41:12.423 --> 41:13.656
I fired him.

41:14.592 --> 41:15.658
You did?

41:23.267 --> 41:24.166
Well, if anyone can turn Legend

41:24.234 --> 41:25.568
into a police horse,

41:25.636 --> 41:27.570
you can,

41:27.638 --> 41:30.740
and you don't need
Chase's help to do that.

41:43.452 --> 41:45.220
This doesn't belong to me.

42:06.185 --> 42:07.847
I know it looks scary.

42:08.700 --> 42:11.868
<i>Come on.</i>

42:12.948 --> 42:14.014
You're okay.

42:20.054 --> 42:22.089
Good boy.

42:24.459 --> 42:25.992
Good boy.

42:26.059 --> 42:27.126
That's it.

42:33.467 --> 42:34.767
So?

42:34.835 --> 42:36.503
You all settled in?

42:37.505 --> 42:40.373
Yeah, just keeping my end
of the bargain.

42:40.440 --> 42:42.174
I got my job back
with Scott too.

42:42.241 --> 42:43.308
Good.

42:44.744 --> 42:46.879
Well, welcome back.

42:48.414 --> 42:49.815
Hey, Jack?

42:51.050 --> 42:52.818
Next summer...

42:52.886 --> 42:55.020
What do you say you and me,
we do another road trip?

42:56.422 --> 42:58.457
This time though
we can skip over the part

42:58.524 --> 43:00.759
where you leave me
in the middle of nowhere.

43:04.430 --> 43:06.064
You're on.

43:06.131 --> 43:07.532
All right.

43:22.481 --> 43:24.482
And that... is it!

43:25.818 --> 43:27.184
We're done?

43:27.252 --> 43:28.786
Yes, we're done,

43:28.853 --> 43:30.320
and it's perfect.

43:39.931 --> 43:42.232
You ready for this, Legend?

43:43.301 --> 43:45.735
You can do it.
