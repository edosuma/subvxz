'The real deal. The real deal, that.

01:40.892 --> 01:43.361
'The champion.
The champion wife of the world.'

01:52.529 --> 01:53.701
'Sorry.

'Hang on, hang on.'

01:55.240 --> 01:56.867
'Mission accomplished.

'Matty Burton!'

02:54.508 --> 02:55.475
Hey, you.

02:56.593 --> 02:57.765
Hey, you, Mimi.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.438
Yo. Yo, Mimi.

03:00.555 --> 03:02.774
How you doing? How you doing?

03:02.891 --> 03:05.064
Eh? All right, beautiful?

03:05.185 --> 03:06.732
Yeah. Where's Mama?

03:06.853 --> 03:08.605
Where's Mama, eh?

03:09.648 --> 03:12.652
It's all sticky. Yeah, it's all sticky.

03:12.776 --> 03:13.948
Yeah!

03:14.069 --> 03:15.992
Daddy have some of your toast?

03:16.113 --> 03:18.457
Have some of Mimi's toast? Daddy eat it?

03:18.573 --> 03:20.075
No? Daddy gonna eat it.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.753
Eh? Daddy can't eat any of your toast.
I got boobies.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.463
I've got to get rid of my boobies.

03:25.580 --> 03:28.254
- I've got bigger boobies than Mummy.
- Oh, is that right?

03:28.959 --> 03:31.929
If Daddy keeps that talk up,
there'll be no booby off Mummy for a month.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.467
- Oi, come here.
- What?

03:33.588 --> 03:36.888
Come here.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.476
Get here.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.145
Thank you.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.270
- I love you.
- Good.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.903
After this fight, I'll take you out
somewhere nice to eat.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.900
Sounds good.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.619
Anywhere you wanna go. It's your choice.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.114
We can go to Nando's.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.241
- Berni Inn.
- Wow!

04:01.366 --> 04:03.585
- Harvester.
- You spoil me.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.209
You deserve it, kid.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.305
Matthew! Mia's right there. It's a bit weird.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.517
Oh?

04:19.634 --> 04:20.851
Mimi?

04:20.969 --> 04:22.391
Come here, baby.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.606
There you go, look. Let's turn you around.

04:25.515 --> 04:28.644
- EMMA: This is so wrong!
- MATTY: Don't look at Mummy and Daddy.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.614
MATTY: You watch the birdies, look.
There you go.

04:34.483 --> 04:37.032
JOURNALIST:
Matty, you lost your father recently.

04:37.152 --> 04:39.701
He was with you in the corner
for your first 33 fights.

04:40.739 --> 04:43.288
What difference will it make
when you walk to the ring?

04:43.408 --> 04:44.830
Will his thoughts be in your head?

04:44.951 --> 04:48.455
Yeah, definitely.
I'll fight in honour of my father.

04:48.580 --> 04:51.459
You know what?
No disrespect to his pops an' all that,

04:51.583 --> 04:55.053
but it wouldn't matter
if he was here or not, he'd still lose.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.298
Every single person
who goes against me goes down,

04:57.422 --> 04:58.890
regardless of who's in his corner.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.180
JOURNALIST:
You should show Matty more respect.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.723
Respect for what? What's he done?

05:02.844 --> 05:05.893
His father was part of boxing folklore.
Surely that's wrong.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.267
All right, go on.
What do you wanna say about your dad?

05:09.810 --> 05:12.359
It's, er... It's fine.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.899
I'm just so grateful
that before he passed away,

05:15.023 --> 05:19.529
I was able to bring the title home
and also I've got a beautiful daughter.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.873
I'm just glad that he was able
to hold her before he left us.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.208
JOURNALIST:
Has that given you extra motivation?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.623
It's another person in my life to protect.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.872
It's just that extra bit of fire.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.420
Having that bit of extra motivation
is gonna help me.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.134
This is his most important fight.

05:34.251 --> 05:37.380
It's the most important fight
of my life, apparently.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.762
Matty, you're fighting Andre The Future.

05:40.882 --> 05:45.058
This is billed as "The Future Is Here".
Do you feel like you've been written off?

05:45.178 --> 05:49.274
If it's all about the future,
the past is gonna bite him on his arse.

05:49.391 --> 05:50.768
(LAUGHTER)

05:50.892 --> 05:54.067
This guy's losing all the time,
and he won this on a default.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.360
It's my duty to go out there and defend it.

05:56.481 --> 05:57.858
He's never been better.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.486
He knows he didn't earn it.
He is not the true champion.

06:00.610 --> 06:03.364
I might not be the best technical boxer,
but I'm the world champion.

06:03.488 --> 06:07.163
A true champion defeats his opponents.
They don't pull out because of an injury.

06:07.284 --> 06:08.911
He's not a true champion.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.288
It will be interesting to see
who's around him

06:11.413 --> 06:12.756
after he loses on the 22nd.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.667
I'm gonna knock him out, take that belt home.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.341
We're gonna dance on his grave
and celebrate his life.

06:18.461 --> 06:19.462
AUDIENCE: Ooh!

06:19.588 --> 06:21.181
MAN: Go on, Matt. Go on!

06:21.298 --> 06:24.973
WARREN: Shall we wrap that up?
Thank you very much for coming down.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.972
- We'll see you fight night.
- Come on, Granddad!

06:28.096 --> 06:32.693
ANDRE: This belt is mine.
Last time you're gonna feel that belt.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.153
Hey, look at me.
What are you looking at them for?

06:35.270 --> 06:36.738
Look at me. You ashamed to look at me?

06:38.440 --> 06:41.615
You want me to look you in the eye?
I'll look you in the eye. There you go.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.453
I'm gonna take your head off.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.745
This is a life-changer for you.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.411
Understand that. It's a life-changer.

07:12.849 --> 07:13.816
Hey!

07:14.726 --> 07:16.569
You're not asleep, are you?

07:16.686 --> 07:18.233
Eh? You're wakies.

07:18.355 --> 07:19.982
You're wakies, eh?

07:20.106 --> 07:21.949
Ah, my baby.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.737
My baby girl, eh?

07:26.196 --> 07:27.789
What's Daddy gonna do?

07:28.531 --> 07:30.408
What's Daddy gonna do, Mimi?

07:30.533 --> 07:31.955
Eh?

07:32.077 --> 07:34.796
Eh? Shall I whup his arse?

07:34.913 --> 07:37.792
Eh? Shall I smoke his boots?

07:37.916 --> 07:41.796
Shall I? Shall I take him
into the deep water and drown him?

07:41.920 --> 07:42.967
Yeah?

07:43.713 --> 07:44.885
Eh?

07:47.384 --> 07:48.511
I love you.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.350
Phwoar.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.441
You've tinkered, haven't you?
You've tinkered, haven't you?

07:54.557 --> 07:56.730
Yeah, you smelly bum-bum.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.654
Come on, let's change your bum.

07:59.771 --> 08:00.772
Yeah.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.695
Slow-mo. There, there, there.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.192
- Feel it?
- Yeah.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.370
There's the shot. Relax on it.

08:08.738 --> 08:09.739
There he is.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.582
Sit down on those hooks.

08:11.700 --> 08:12.701
Again.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.211
There he is. There he is.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.671
Spring back in with that right.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.267
Time.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.234

08:38.351 --> 08:39.193
Nice.

08:39.309 --> 08:40.732
Another one in.

08:43.063 --> 08:44.441
Exhale. Nice and slow.

08:44.566 --> 08:45.818
Slow it down. That's it.

08:46.401 --> 08:47.823
RICHIE: Come on.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.287
Been eating Mimi's treats?

08:50.864 --> 08:52.241
It'll come off in the bath.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.827
Let's go. Eight.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.042
Sharp stuff.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.791
Three, four, five, relax.

09:12.927 --> 09:17.729
And now to the scales, the WBO
middleweight champion of the world,

09:42.916 --> 09:44.634
STEVE BUNCE: 'Andre, your best chance

09:44.751 --> 09:47.129
'is because he's, according
to you, over the hill.'

09:47.253 --> 09:49.881
ANDRE: 'The best of him is gone,
but I could beat the best of him.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.225
'What is the best of him? Please tell me.

'From my point of view, Steve,
look, this fight is about experience,

'He's a sluggish fighter.
Just stands there, takes beats.

10:10.026 --> 10:13.280
'What's there to fear or respect?
People are gonna go, "Matty who?"'

10:23.206 --> 10:25.425
JACKIE: Here he is. You all right, champ?

10:25.542 --> 10:27.215
- Yeah, mate.

Yeah.

- How do I look?
- Smart.

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:17.850
Good.

There you go.

01:17:31.772 --> 01:17:33.524
Come here.

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:34.776
Very dapper.

01:17:35.359 --> 01:17:37.453
Gonna be a lot of people out for you tonight.

We're gonna celebrate his life.

01:18:12.062 --> 01:18:16.067
I wanna take you back to that night
when he retained his title.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:18.160
What a memory that was.
What a fight that was.

01:18:18.277 --> 01:18:20.405
Weren't it fantastic? That was brilliant.

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:22.532
That was Matty as we want to remember him.

01:18:22.656 --> 01:18:24.579
Let's welcome him to the stage,

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.998

01:18:59.818 --> 01:19:01.912

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:08.370
I want to say to you,

01:19:09.954 --> 01:19:12.924
I don't blame you for what happened to me.

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:15.668
I don't blame boxing.

01:19:17.294 --> 01:19:19.262
I love boxing.

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:21.223
It made me who I am today.

01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:27.145
I'm glad this never happened to you.

01:19:28.847 --> 01:19:31.441
Because I don't want anybody...

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:35.779
to go through what I've been through.

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:38.315
Because it's been hard.

01:19:40.317 --> 01:19:45.790
I want to say
a special thank you to my friends,

01:19:46.699 --> 01:19:52.081
to Richie and to Jackie,
for looking after me.

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:57.092
I thought you'd left me but you came back.

01:19:58.085 --> 01:20:02.386
I love you and thank you very much
for being in my life.

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:06.969
A few weeks ago

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:12.980
I tried to end my life.

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:17.613
I wanted to die.

01:20:19.523 --> 01:20:21.446
I jumped into the water.

01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:25.362
In the water

01:20:26.196 --> 01:20:27.914
I saw my wife

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:30.201
and my baby.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.003
It made me want to live again.

01:20:37.124 --> 01:20:38.671
I lost my belt

01:20:39.626 --> 01:20:41.048
in the water.

01:20:43.714 --> 01:20:45.307
It's just a belt.

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:48.844
It doesn't mean anything,

01:20:50.262 --> 01:20:53.766
compared to the people I love.

01:20:55.642 --> 01:20:57.315
I don't want to lose them.

01:21:00.814 --> 01:21:03.693
Every day I train hard,

01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:07.781
get my mind sharp,

01:21:09.615 --> 01:21:11.538
and keep training.

01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:13.752
I hope that...

01:21:15.287 --> 01:21:17.540
the people I love the most

01:21:18.499 --> 01:21:20.342
come back to my life.

01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:24.463
Um...

01:21:28.675 --> 01:21:30.097

It's gone.

01:22:36.493 --> 01:22:38.712
Excuse me, Matty. Big fan.
Any chance of a selfie?

01:22:38.829 --> 01:22:40.672
- Course you can.
- You're a star.

01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:43.759
