WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.637
I'm here to celebrate the good
news about my beloved nephew

00:03.671 --> 00:04.538
dating AnnaBeth Nass.

00:04.572 --> 00:05.573
I'm here to warn you.

00:05.606 --> 00:06.640
You came to my house

00:06.674 --> 00:08.042
to tell me
my new boyfriend

00:08.076 --> 00:09.777
is only with me
as part of a plot...

00:09.810 --> 00:11.779
I'm trying to protect you.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.647
You're being
a jealous ex-boyfriend.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.116
GEORGE:
 The sex was amazing.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.417
With Lemon?!
Shh! Shh!

00:16.450 --> 00:18.519
Every time I look at her,
I am physically unable

00:18.552 --> 00:19.553
to stop picturing it.

00:20.788 --> 00:23.457
What's he...?
Charles slept
on the couch.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.426
He stayed here?
It wasn't a big deal.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.561
Okay.
I should go.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.663
Yeah. I'll call you later.

00:47.848 --> 00:50.050
Oh, what the hell.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.722
(beep)

00:54.755 --> 00:56.724
Hi! You've reached
Vivian Wilkes.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.492
Leave a message.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.861
Uh, hey, Viv. It's Wade calling.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.597
Just thought
I'd give you a shout.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.199
Been a few days...
(thudding)

01:07.168 --> 01:09.803
I am gonna wring your little...!

01:09.837 --> 01:12.173
Uh...

01:12.206 --> 01:13.641
not you.

01:13.674 --> 01:14.875
The... the raccoon.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.844
Which-which... may...

01:16.877 --> 01:18.779
May-Maybe that sounded weird,
but there was...

01:18.812 --> 01:20.648
there was a raccoon.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.583
Which you probably guessed.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.852
And, uh, well, now it's gone.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.854
So, uh...

01:26.887 --> 01:28.822
look, I-I'd love to see you.

01:28.856 --> 01:33.194
And there are no more raccoons
over here at Casa de Wade.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.229
Call me.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.598
(beep)

01:37.631 --> 01:39.333
(whispering):
Casa de Wade. What?

01:39.367 --> 01:41.202
LAVON:
 I can't get any lower.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.237
I've sunk as low
 as humanly possible.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.606
Blew our chance
to host the county fair.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.775
A.B. hates me, town hates me.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.510
And, in worse news,

01:49.543 --> 01:51.679
I am the subject
of the Owls' charity roast.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.514
They won't even need
to write jokes.

01:53.547 --> 01:57.318
Come on. I know times are rough,
but you're Lavon Hayes.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.753
Two Super Bowls,
four Pro Bowls.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.656
Every time you get knocked down,
you get right back up. Come on.

02:02.690 --> 02:03.891
Go.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.826
Oh.
Geez.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.895
I did get knocked down a lot.

02:07.928 --> 02:10.231
See, it's a pattern.
No, that's not
what I meant at all.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.265
Oh.

02:11.299 --> 02:12.533
Oh. (sighs)

02:12.566 --> 02:13.734
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

02:13.767 --> 02:14.835
I need to talk to you.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.537
LAVON:
Not now.
Owl meeting.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.606
I got to face the
music, the pitchforks,

02:18.639 --> 02:20.241
the rotten tomatoes in my face.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.942
(scoffs)

02:21.975 --> 02:24.245
(laughs)

02:24.278 --> 02:27.815
Wade, everything okay?

02:27.848 --> 02:29.917
Just fine. Dandy.

02:29.950 --> 02:33.654
Yeah? Well, that thinking crease
is making a rare appearance

02:33.687 --> 02:35.789
in your forehead,
so, what's going on?

02:35.823 --> 02:37.791
It's just Vivian.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.593
All right?
Things are, oh,

02:39.627 --> 02:40.761
weird between us.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.663
She's distant, she
won't return my calls.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.665
She's spending a lot
of time with Charles.

02:44.698 --> 02:45.966
So, her and Charles are friends.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.269
It's evolved.
It's great for Harley.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.571
I wish my parents made
that kind of effort.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.340
Trust me, he's not making
that effort for Harley.

02:52.373 --> 02:55.343
Oh, Wade, come on.
Vivian is crazy about you!

02:55.376 --> 02:57.645
And Charles--
he's Charles.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.280
But you-- you're you.

02:59.313 --> 03:01.215
You know?
He's not a threat.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.950
Oh, come on.
No more thinking face.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.952
Look, I'll tell you what.

03:04.985 --> 03:07.388
I have plans with Vivian
to get our nails done later.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.689
I'll do some digging.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.691
You'd do that for me?
Yeah, well, I have to.

03:10.724 --> 03:11.825
I am your doctor.

03:11.859 --> 03:12.960
Besides, all this sudden

03:12.993 --> 03:15.696
thinking could be very dangerous
for your unused brain.

03:15.729 --> 03:16.897
Ha, ha.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.699
Thank you.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.334
Mm-hmm.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.971
George.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.339
(distorted):
George.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.741
(distorted):
Have you seen this report?

03:27.775 --> 03:28.876
(clearly):
What are we gonna do?

03:28.909 --> 03:30.411
Uh...

03:30.444 --> 03:33.314
George! You're
doing it again.

03:33.347 --> 03:34.982
You're zoning out.
No. No. No,
Lemon, I'm not.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.684
I was... I was just...
I was just

03:36.717 --> 03:37.885
really thinking
about what you were saying.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.988
Which was...?
You know, the...

03:41.021 --> 03:42.456
(mutters)
The health
inspection report.

03:42.490 --> 03:43.957
Yeah.
We got an A-minus.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.893
Which is great.
An A-minus, George.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.462
An A-minus!

03:48.496 --> 03:50.898
Mae Ellen Waterloo has never
given me less than an "A,"

03:50.931 --> 03:52.433
not even for the Rammer Jammer.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.335
A glowing and pristine
cleanliness is my signature.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.669
Okay.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.871
Well, then, maybe Mae,
you know, had a bad morning.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.341
She got out of bed on
the wrong side, or someone peed

04:00.374 --> 04:03.043
in her coffee.
Who knows?
Well, not at Fancie's!

04:03.076 --> 04:04.312
That might have happened
at the Rammer Jammer,

04:04.345 --> 04:05.413
but nobody ever knew, so...

04:05.446 --> 04:06.847
I wish I didn't know about it.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.982
George, you're right.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.018
Mae wasn't her usual
bubbly self. She wasn't

04:11.051 --> 04:12.886
whistling or making any jokes.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.788
Exactly. There you go.
Mystery solved.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.023
Now you can just move on.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.959
Or... I can fix her.

04:19.993 --> 04:22.262
Thank you, George.

04:31.038 --> 04:34.041
Good Owls, last week
I let my personal life--

04:34.074 --> 04:35.776
you know, my breakup with A.B.,

04:35.809 --> 04:38.045
my animosity
for all things Gainey--

04:38.078 --> 04:40.848
get in the way
of BlueBell's best interest.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.950
Which is why
I understand if you want

04:42.983 --> 04:45.085
to cancel your annual
Mayoral Toast and Roast.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.855
Better yet, let's
vote on a replacement.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.022
I nominate me.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.058
MAYFAIR:
No! Now, is there

04:51.091 --> 04:53.327
anyone here
who has not crossed the line

04:53.361 --> 04:55.062
when it comes
to matters of the heart?

04:55.095 --> 04:56.464
Hmm? Why,
when I was

04:56.497 --> 04:58.332
in the seventh grade,
I joined the choir

04:58.366 --> 05:00.334
just so I could sit next
to Ella-Jean Swain.

05:00.368 --> 05:01.802
BILL:
It is possible

05:01.835 --> 05:03.704
that I may have let

05:03.737 --> 05:06.440
Cupid's arrow talk me out
of any number of tickets.

05:06.474 --> 05:08.776
Mm.
I sent 150 postcards
to Kerry Washington

05:08.809 --> 05:10.077
and flowers on
her birthday.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.512
All returned.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.547
(crowd murmuring)
Mm. Mayor Hayes,

05:13.581 --> 05:16.550
we, the Owls,
stand by you.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.952
All those in favor
of moving forward

05:18.986 --> 05:20.854
with the Mayoral
Toast and Roast,

05:20.888 --> 05:22.055
let me
hear you hoot.

05:22.089 --> 05:24.024
(all hooting)

05:26.594 --> 05:28.829
Hooty, hoot, hoot, hoot!
(hooting continues)

05:31.865 --> 05:33.967
Belles, I understand
there are some among you

05:34.001 --> 05:36.737
that may take issue
with my new boyfriend.

05:36.770 --> 05:39.940
It is true
that Davis Polk is a Gainey,

05:39.973 --> 05:42.443
but he is also
a wonderful

05:42.476 --> 05:44.011
and honest man.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.880
That said, if you feel
the need to censure me

05:46.914 --> 05:48.916
or even ask for my resignation

05:48.949 --> 05:51.452
as Belle co-leader,
I will not object.

05:51.485 --> 05:52.486
Well, I will.

05:52.520 --> 05:53.587
If AnnaBeth is happy,

05:53.621 --> 05:54.955
then we should be happy

05:54.988 --> 05:56.590
for her.
Agreed.

05:56.624 --> 05:57.925
Seconded and thirded!

05:57.958 --> 05:59.393
Especially after the way

05:59.427 --> 06:01.094
you crapped out
in love this year.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.830
Oops.
Send that to college, Crickett.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.399
What I mean is,
shame on Mayor Hayes!

06:05.433 --> 06:06.400
(overlapping chatter)

06:06.434 --> 06:08.001
He wastes

06:08.035 --> 06:09.870
some of
your most fertile months,

06:09.903 --> 06:12.072
breaks up with you,
and then has the gall

06:12.105 --> 06:13.006
to Gainey-shame you?!

06:13.040 --> 06:15.142
Well, I'm not sure
I would go that far...

06:15.175 --> 06:16.844
That's right, Elodie.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.879
Lavon is the one who
should be censured.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.848
I move that we pull out

06:20.881 --> 06:23.451
of the Owls' Mayoral Toast
and Roast this year

06:23.484 --> 06:26.520
in solidarity
for our beloved A.B.

06:26.554 --> 06:27.821
Oh, I don't know.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.990
I mean, we've rehearsed,
and the costumes

06:30.023 --> 06:30.824
are really great.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.160
But, oh, y'all would do that
for me?

06:33.193 --> 06:33.961
All in favor?

06:33.994 --> 06:34.962
ALL:
Yea!

06:34.995 --> 06:37.898
Yay!

06:40.968 --> 06:42.870
Hey, George.
How are you?
Oh, hey.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.539
Good to see you.
Oh, I'm good.
I'm good. Thank you so much,

06:45.573 --> 06:48.642
Reverend, for taking
the time to see me.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.444
It's much appreciated.
Well,

06:50.478 --> 06:54.081
of course, whenever one of my
flock asks for help, I help.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.016
So, lay it on me, brother.

06:56.049 --> 06:56.950
(laughs)

06:56.984 --> 06:59.052
It's a little too much
vernacular sauce?

06:59.086 --> 07:00.087
No, no, it's-it's...

07:00.120 --> 07:01.121
I'm sorry.
Just a little...

07:01.154 --> 07:02.523
Go ahead.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.925
Uh, but, anyway,
the-the situation is...

07:04.958 --> 07:07.861
You know, say that one
of your flock, uh,

07:07.895 --> 07:10.998
had developed feelings for the

07:11.031 --> 07:14.535
most spoiled, irritating
and annoying sheep in town,

07:14.568 --> 07:18.572
and-and... he wants
to rid himself of said feelings.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.608
George, it sounds
like you need something

07:20.641 --> 07:23.010
to take your mind off
this particular sheep,

07:23.043 --> 07:25.112
and I know
just what it should be.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.047
Prayer.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.550
A date with our visiting
Sunday school teacher.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.218
Oh, yeah. No.

07:31.251 --> 07:34.021
I mean, no offense, Reverend,

07:34.054 --> 07:36.957
but that-that is so not
what I had in mind.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.859
Well, I think
it's a great idea.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.994
And you know who also thinks so?

07:43.263 --> 07:45.098
Big guy in the sky?

07:45.132 --> 07:47.635
That's correct, George.
Big guy in the sky.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.970
Yeah, I was afraid of that.

07:50.003 --> 07:53.140
Yeah, and now that Harley has
gotten a hit in the actual game,

07:53.173 --> 07:55.543
he's telling the coach
to call him Little Papi.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.277
That is so cute.
I know.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.013
How-How's, uh, everything
else going? How's work?

08:00.047 --> 08:01.582
It's good. We're starting
our unit on geology,

08:01.615 --> 08:02.950
which is my favorite
time of year.

08:02.983 --> 08:03.851
That is awesome.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.619
How is Wade? How are
things going there?

08:05.653 --> 08:07.187
Why are you asking?

08:07.220 --> 08:09.122
You don't usually.
Did he say something?

08:09.156 --> 08:10.958
No! No.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.593
Okay, well, he might
have mentioned

08:12.626 --> 08:14.127
that you hadn't
called him back.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.129
Yeah.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.065
I've sort of been
avoiding him.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.067
What? Why?

08:20.100 --> 08:22.636
The other night,
Wade told me

08:22.670 --> 08:24.605
that he thought Charles
was trying to get me back.

08:24.638 --> 08:25.739
So Wade was jealous.

08:25.773 --> 08:27.107
You can't punish
him for that.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.676
But the thing is,
Wade was right.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.744
Charles does want you back?

08:31.945 --> 08:33.581
But what about you?
How do you feel?

08:33.614 --> 08:35.215
Confused.

08:35.248 --> 08:38.318
Charles and I had nearly
15 happy years together.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.621
He's the father
of my child.

08:40.654 --> 08:43.222
But he left,
and now there's Wade, who...

08:43.256 --> 08:44.958
He's amazing, and...

08:44.992 --> 08:46.994
And he cares about you a lot.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.029
I know.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.031
Promise me you won't
tell him, okay?

08:51.064 --> 08:53.033
Okay.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.568
But you have to.

08:54.602 --> 08:56.604
I will.

08:56.637 --> 08:59.139
Just as soon as I decide
what to tell him.

09:02.810 --> 09:05.212
(car horn honks)

09:05.245 --> 09:07.314
(seagulls calling)

09:07.347 --> 09:09.650
(birds singing)

09:18.692 --> 09:20.661
(screams)

09:20.694 --> 09:22.596
Hey, Doc. Just doing a bit
of tree-trimming.

09:22.630 --> 09:23.697
Sorry I scared you.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.198
No, no, not scared.
See you later.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.800
Uh, you know,
I stopped by last night.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.068
You-you didn't answer.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.236
Oh, I fell asleep early.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.704
At 8:30?
Yeah, I was exhausted.

09:30.738 --> 09:31.972
Or you're avoiding me.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.641
What?! Why would I do that?

09:33.674 --> 09:34.574
I don't know.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.977
'Cause Vivian told you something
yesterday.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.079
Something you're reluctant
to repeat.

09:39.112 --> 09:42.015
Funny thing, I didn't even
see Vivian yesterday.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.718
There was a huge,
exhausting medical emergency,

09:44.752 --> 09:46.219
which is why I
fell asleep early,

09:46.253 --> 09:47.821
which explains everything. Bye.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.792
(sighs)

09:51.825 --> 09:57.297
Okay, uh, Lavon, you'll do
your mayoral champagne toast,

09:57.330 --> 09:59.232
applause, applause, applause.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.367
Then I will

10:00.400 --> 10:01.735
introduce the Belles,

10:01.769 --> 10:03.370
who will then sing
an original number.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.238
Why are they late to rehearsal?

10:05.272 --> 10:07.240
I don't stand for divas.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.276
Crickett texted me.
They're on their way.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.410
CRICKETT:
Update.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.346
We have arrived!

10:15.148 --> 10:17.718
Where are the rest
of 'em?
DASH:
Ladies,

10:17.751 --> 10:21.054
might I remind y'all that
rehearsal is mandatory?

10:21.088 --> 10:23.123
Oh. Oh, we're not here
to rehearse.

10:23.156 --> 10:26.059
(plays note)

10:26.093 --> 10:28.395
* You showed up drunk
on A.B.'s door *

10:28.428 --> 10:31.398
* You basically called her
Gainey's whore *

10:31.431 --> 10:33.701
* Well, you won't get away
with that no more *

10:33.734 --> 10:35.135
* So there'll be no Belles

10:35.168 --> 10:37.037
* At the Toast and Roast

10:37.070 --> 10:38.839
* So suck it...

10:38.872 --> 10:40.107
* Lavon

10:40.140 --> 10:42.309
* Hayes.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.385
O-Okay, uh,

10:52.419 --> 10:53.721
d-don't worry about this.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.188
Heh. I'll fix it.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.157
(chuckles,
clears throat)

10:57.190 --> 10:58.425
(indistinct chatter)

10:58.458 --> 11:00.193
MAN:
That was just rude.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.763
(band playing foxtrot music)

11:04.197 --> 11:05.365
Mae?

11:05.398 --> 11:08.435
Lemon.
What are you doing here?

11:08.468 --> 11:11.772
(sighing): Well... I was
worried about you, Mae.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.073
When you came
to Fancie's earlier,

11:13.106 --> 11:14.842
you weren't
your usual self.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.244
You were missing
your pep, your zest,

11:17.277 --> 11:20.080
your joie de vivre,
so I brought pie.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.381
(laughing):
Joie de vivre pie?

11:21.414 --> 11:22.883
Is this about that A-minus?

11:22.916 --> 11:25.452
(chuckles) It's not
the grade I care about.

11:25.485 --> 11:28.321
(foxtrot music continues)
It's the, uh... credibility

11:28.355 --> 11:29.790
of the system.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.458
What is that music?

11:31.491 --> 11:33.293
That's the sound of
my broken dreams.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.462
Not enough pie in the
world to fix 'em.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.097
Oh, Mae, I knew
it must have been something.

11:37.130 --> 11:37.998
Sweetie, tell me.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.433
Well, I just spent
the last six months

11:40.467 --> 11:43.203
rehearsing for a ballroom
dance competition tonight,

11:43.236 --> 11:45.505
until my partner tore
his Achilles tendon.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.940
I didn't want to win.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.742
I just wanted to
compete, you know?

11:48.776 --> 11:51.311
Like that character in that
movie who just wants to dance.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.914
Black Swan?
 The Company? Step Up?

11:53.947 --> 11:55.949
Shall We Dance?
 Step Up 2?

11:55.983 --> 11:58.451
Dance With Me? Take the Lead?
 Strictly Ballroom?

11:58.485 --> 12:01.354
Silver Linings
 Playbook?
Third one, I think.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.891
*
What if I told you

12:03.924 --> 12:06.326
that I happen to know
an excellent ballroom dancer

12:06.359 --> 12:08.128
who's available this evening?

12:08.161 --> 12:10.931
I guess... I would
have to ask...

12:10.964 --> 12:12.766
does he have good hygiene?

12:12.800 --> 12:15.468
I mean, once a health inspector,
always a health inspector.

12:15.502 --> 12:18.238
As a matter of fact,
he is a doctor.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.908
I know this medication
is helping me,

12:20.941 --> 12:23.811
but I think
it's making me crazy.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.279
One second,
I'm so happy.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.849
I look at Tom,
I love him so much.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.517
The next,

12:30.550 --> 12:34.855
I see his eyebrows,
and they are so bushy.

12:34.888 --> 12:38.191
I want to tear those
eyebrows out, like rip
them off his face!

12:38.225 --> 12:40.293
But moodiness is a common
side effect of Clomiphene.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.394
Now the good news:

12:41.428 --> 12:43.163
it is working!

12:43.196 --> 12:46.266
You are officially
ovulating.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.568
So you and Tom need to start
trying to make

12:48.601 --> 12:50.403
a baby tonight.
(chuckles)

12:50.437 --> 12:52.806
Bushy eyebrows or not.
(quiet laugh)

12:52.840 --> 12:54.307
(bell tinkles)

12:55.308 --> 12:57.310
Hey.

12:57.344 --> 13:00.313
AnnaBeth, could you
do me a small favor?
If Wade happens to ask,

13:00.347 --> 13:03.350
can you say there was a medical
emergency yesterday afternoon?

13:03.383 --> 13:04.584
You want me to lie to Wade?

13:04.617 --> 13:06.319
Exactly. Also,
if he calls or drops by,

13:06.353 --> 13:08.288
can you tell him that
I'm in with a patient?

13:08.321 --> 13:10.991
Also a lie. Wanda's
the only patient

13:11.024 --> 13:13.393
on the books, and she
is already in with Brick.

13:13.426 --> 13:16.029
What? Brick needs a consult?
I'll be right in.

13:16.063 --> 13:17.564
Oh, hey, Wade.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.432
I hope you're not sick,
'cause sadly,

13:19.466 --> 13:20.700
there's a situation
with a patient.

13:20.733 --> 13:23.904
Brick and I are probably gonna
be in with her a-all morning.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.840
A-All day.
Maybe into night.

13:26.874 --> 13:29.843
Did you hear about
that big medical
emergency yesterday?

13:29.877 --> 13:31.444
Because, boy,
it was very big,

13:31.478 --> 13:32.545
very...

13:32.579 --> 13:34.314
medical.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.883
Hmm.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.918
Dr. Hart, what are...
what are you?
Oh, well,

13:37.951 --> 13:39.252
Wanda's my patient, too,

13:39.286 --> 13:41.021
and I also care about
her future offspring.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.622
How is the
Clomiphene going?

13:42.655 --> 13:46.559
It's making me crazy,
but it's working.
Yeah.
Hey,

13:46.593 --> 13:49.529
that's great!
Now, now, I'm just
gonna let Wanda go home

13:49.562 --> 13:51.965
and get ready
for baby-making tonight.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.467
Home? No.
We should talk first.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.336
Have a nice long talk,

13:56.369 --> 13:57.938
you know,
about positions and timing,

13:57.971 --> 14:00.340
getting Tom to relax,
getting him in the mood.

14:00.373 --> 14:03.944
What? You think I can't
get Tom in the mood?

14:03.977 --> 14:05.946
Well, I most
certainly can!

14:05.979 --> 14:08.281
Why do you
think I can't?
No. Nothing. No reason.

14:08.315 --> 14:09.582
Good! 'Cause I can!

14:11.284 --> 14:13.320
Thank you for your
input, Dr. Hart.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.654
That was very helpful.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.957
Yes, Sergeant Jeffries
was bitten by an anaconda.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.391
Hmm.
But luckily, Dr. Hart

14:18.425 --> 14:20.093
was there
to stitch him up.
Oh.

14:20.127 --> 14:21.461
WANDA:
Anacondas?

14:21.494 --> 14:22.462
In BlueBell?

14:22.495 --> 14:25.532
What kind of place is this
to raise a child?!

14:25.565 --> 14:27.334
(Wanda sobbing)

14:27.367 --> 14:28.668
Hey,

14:28.701 --> 14:29.937
Doc.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.972
You know, AnnaBeth was actually

14:32.005 --> 14:33.974
just telling me
about the big emergency.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.408
See, I didn't realize

14:35.442 --> 14:37.377
we've got anacondas
here in Alabama.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.380
ANNABETH:
Uh, that's right, we don't.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.415
It must have escaped
from the zoo.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.317
That explains it!
Very likely story.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.986
Thank you, AnnaBeth.
(weak chuckle)

14:47.487 --> 14:49.089
I can't tell you.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.591
Zoe, please,
you've got to tell me.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.562
LulaBelle, why
don't you tell George

14:55.595 --> 14:58.631
about your summer working
as a counselor at Bible camp?
Oh, wow.

14:58.665 --> 15:01.601
Wow, Sunday school
teacher all year round,
and Bible camp

15:01.634 --> 15:03.937
in the summer--
that is so, uh...

15:03.971 --> 15:06.539
"Devout" is the word
that you're looking for.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.008
That is. That is the word

15:08.041 --> 15:10.310
I was looking for.
George also

15:10.343 --> 15:12.412
spent a summer working in
Bible camp. Didn't you?

15:12.445 --> 15:14.381
I did. I did.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.716
I also found it
to be extremely

15:16.749 --> 15:20.520
enlightening and,
uh, and-and whatnot.

15:20.553 --> 15:23.356
Hey, here's an idea.
Why don't you two kids

15:23.390 --> 15:26.159
go out for a nice dinner
and share war stories?

15:26.193 --> 15:28.395
Yeah! You
talk it over.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.497
The reverend is gonna help
me make another pot of tea.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.432
(laughs): No, sweetheart,
you don't need two people

15:32.465 --> 15:33.566
to make a pot of...

15:33.600 --> 15:35.535
Yes, you do need
two people.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.037
GEORGE: So...

15:37.070 --> 15:39.672
(clears throat, chuckles)

15:39.706 --> 15:42.609
Uh, so, about tonight...

15:42.642 --> 15:44.677
Pick me up at 7:00.
Drop me off around the corner.

15:44.711 --> 15:47.514
I'll tell the Mayfairs we
went for burgers and bowling.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.781
No one'll be the wiser.

15:48.815 --> 15:51.618
Are you blowing me off?
No offense,
but anyone who thought

15:51.651 --> 15:55.388
Bible camp was "enlightening"
just is not my type.
Well,

15:55.422 --> 15:57.690
uh, I am sitting here,
having tea and crumpets

15:57.724 --> 16:00.693
with the reverend and his wife.
(brief chuckle)

16:00.727 --> 16:03.063
What exactly
would you like me to say?

16:03.096 --> 16:05.465
So you lied
to a man of the cloth

16:05.498 --> 16:08.068
in his own home,
over his own tea and crumpets?

16:08.101 --> 16:10.537
I am a little bit more
complicated than I seem.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.139
We'll have to see about that.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.606
I was gonna try
this new club

16:13.640 --> 16:15.642
in Montgomery tonight.
You want to join?

16:15.675 --> 16:18.411
You know, I am looking
for a distraction,

16:18.445 --> 16:20.147
so yes, why the hell not?

16:20.180 --> 16:21.748
ZOE:
 Vivian's my cousin,

16:21.781 --> 16:23.083
Wade-- I promised.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.617
But you want
to tell me.

16:24.651 --> 16:25.718
I can see that.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.420
Yes.
So if you
can't speak,

16:27.454 --> 16:29.422
maybe you can... blink.

16:29.456 --> 16:32.559
All right? Like, one blink
for no, two blinks for yes.

16:34.127 --> 16:37.097
Why aren't you saying anything?
You in or out?

16:37.130 --> 16:38.631
Well, I was blinking.
I just blinked twice.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.567
Oh. Oh, oh, all right.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.735
So... was I right?

16:42.769 --> 16:45.172
Is Charles trying
to win Vivian back?

16:47.740 --> 16:49.209
(gulps)

16:49.242 --> 16:52.779
And is...
is she considering him?

16:56.116 --> 16:57.750
You got something
in your eye, Doc?

17:04.223 --> 17:06.093
Wade, where
are you going?

17:07.160 --> 17:08.694
(groans)

17:08.728 --> 17:09.762
(knocking)

17:11.263 --> 17:12.499
Lavon.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.501
Look, I-I get that
you're still mad at me

17:14.534 --> 17:16.069
and it's probably
gonna take a while

17:16.103 --> 17:18.105
for you to forgive me,
if ever. That's fair.

17:18.137 --> 17:20.807
But considering how
small this town is,
could you try

17:20.839 --> 17:23.210
and resist turning the Belles
against me, too?

17:23.242 --> 17:25.278
I'm sorry,
you think I did what now?

17:25.311 --> 17:27.547
The Belles dropped out
of the Mayoral Toast and Roast.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.282
You're the leader
of the Belles.

17:29.316 --> 17:31.084
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

17:31.118 --> 17:34.087
You'd think a couple of days
could go by without you

17:34.121 --> 17:37.524
blindly accusing me of
sabotaging the town of BlueBell?

17:37.557 --> 17:38.825
I see.

17:38.858 --> 17:41.094
So this is not you punishing me?

17:41.128 --> 17:43.596
No. You did that
all on your own,

17:43.630 --> 17:45.498
with your ridiculous
and childish

17:45.532 --> 17:47.500
and very un-mayoral behavior.

17:47.534 --> 17:48.768
Okay, you know what?

17:48.801 --> 17:51.538
I came here to apologize, again.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.140
Try and make peace.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.507
Forget it.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.644
Yeah, you know what?
The-the Mayoral

17:57.677 --> 18:00.313
Toast and Roast will-will do
just fine without the Belles.

18:00.347 --> 18:02.182
Yeah, we will sell
plenty of tickets

18:02.215 --> 18:03.716
without your dumb song.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.219
Oh! Well, that is
really good to hear,

18:06.253 --> 18:09.722
because the Belles
are about to be

18:09.756 --> 18:12.559
very busy preparing
for a new tradition.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.262
The first ever annual

18:15.295 --> 18:17.730
Head-of-the-Belles
Toast and Roast.

18:17.764 --> 18:18.865
What?

18:18.898 --> 18:20.233
But there is no...

18:20.267 --> 18:22.169
Oh, you can't do that.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.903
Oh, I just did.
Oh, and guess what.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.872
It happens to be
on the same night.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.340
(gasps): Oh!
See you, Lavon.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.741
(door slams)

18:28.775 --> 18:30.310
(grunts)

18:31.911 --> 18:34.781
(thunder crashes)

18:36.783 --> 18:38.685
Of course.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.123
(knocking)

18:45.925 --> 18:47.794
Zoe told you.

18:47.827 --> 18:48.795
Yeah.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.631
Wade... I'm so sorry.
No, let me

18:51.664 --> 18:53.666
talk first, all right?
I got something to say.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.335
I get what being

18:55.368 --> 18:56.736
with Charles means, all right?

18:56.769 --> 18:59.239
You got a son
and you got history.

18:59.272 --> 19:02.242
But you and me, w-we got
something real right now.

19:02.275 --> 19:05.912
And I'm not gonna stand by and
let him take you away from me.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.380
I-I can't do that.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.850
That is the most...

19:10.883 --> 19:13.152
romantic thing I've ever heard.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.935
*

19:28.968 --> 19:30.937
(whistling)

19:30.970 --> 19:32.372
Well, hello there, Doc.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.806
You're up early.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.375
It is a glorious day,

19:35.408 --> 19:37.277
is it not?
Where have you been?

19:37.310 --> 19:39.646
Well, a gentleman
doesn't kiss and tell.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.314
But because
I am no gentleman...
Hmm.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.915
I was at Vivian's.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.917
Oh, really?
So you talked?
Mm-hmm.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.820
Put it all on the line.
Told her I wouldn't
give up without a fight.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.423
And then she
took me in her arms...

19:50.457 --> 19:53.326
like in one of those
movies you like so much.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.295
Wade, that's amazing.
Well,

19:55.328 --> 19:57.297
the better man won.
Well, so when's

19:57.330 --> 19:59.799
she gonna talk to Charles?
I don't know.
I don't care.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.868
But she did say she
was gonna talk to him?

20:01.901 --> 20:04.804
Well, I mean, not
in so many words.
But it was

20:04.837 --> 20:07.407
strongly implied
by her lack of clothing.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.708
Hmm?
Okay.

20:08.741 --> 20:11.878
Look, we had
an incredible night last night.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.780
And if you're saying

20:13.813 --> 20:15.948
(chuckles):
that... I mean, after we...

20:15.982 --> 20:17.850
and...

20:17.884 --> 20:20.753
th-th-that she
would choose him...

20:20.787 --> 20:21.988
W... I'm not saying anything.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.991
Look, I just hope that you're
not jumping to conclusions,

20:25.024 --> 20:26.959
hearing things that
weren't actually said.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.298
Look, I-I don't want to put you
in an awkward position,

20:31.331 --> 20:34.334
but maybe you could, uh...
you can just talk to her.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.035
All right?
Put in a good word for me.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.738
She trusts you.
Okay.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.441
Zoe Hart! All right!
Hey, you want to head over

20:41.474 --> 20:43.009
to Lavon's? If he's
making waffles,

20:43.042 --> 20:44.677
I'm buying.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.012
All right, well,
let's do it. Come on.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.647
I got your
little mag here.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.049
It's a newspaper!
A newspaper, Wade.
Oh, yeah.

20:50.082 --> 20:54.354
Without the Belles,
this Toast and Roast is toast.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.055
If they're putting on
their own show,

20:56.088 --> 20:57.657
who's gonna want
to watch us?

20:57.690 --> 20:59.459
I don't even know
what we're doing here.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.761
I got 19 episodes
of Chicago Fire

21:01.794 --> 21:04.331
burning up my DVR.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.498
We all done crying
in our soup?

21:05.532 --> 21:06.833
Oh, come on, Lavon,
you got to admit,

21:06.866 --> 21:08.735
things are looking mighty bleak.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.837
No. No, I don't.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.805
And you know why?

21:12.839 --> 21:14.407
'Cause I'm talking
to the BlueBell Owls.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.476
Okay, look,
maybe

21:16.509 --> 21:18.711
our legs won't look as good
in a cancan line

21:18.745 --> 21:20.046
as the Belles.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.047
But we got something else.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.782
It's gonna be that kind of show?

21:22.815 --> 21:24.050
Like a Full Monty type thing?

21:24.083 --> 21:25.952
What? No!

21:25.985 --> 21:28.388
Look, I'm talking
about what we got right here.

21:28.421 --> 21:29.989
I am sitting here

21:30.022 --> 21:32.692
with the most talented
musical men of this generation.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.361
Now, who's with me?

21:34.394 --> 21:36.028
(grumbling)

21:36.062 --> 21:36.829
I don't know, Lavon.

21:37.497 --> 21:40.533
Stanley.

21:40.567 --> 21:43.069
I saw you channel Fred Astaire
in Shelby's cabaret.

21:43.102 --> 21:45.405
Oh, yeah, he did, yeah.
Huh? At least from
the knees down.

21:45.438 --> 21:48.074
And, Frank,
Bill, Wally,

21:48.107 --> 21:49.075
y'all harmonize

21:49.108 --> 21:50.843
like the best barbershop
quartet,

21:50.877 --> 21:52.412
and there's only three of you.

21:52.445 --> 21:53.346
Yeah, that's true.
Huh?

21:53.380 --> 21:54.547
That's true.

21:54.581 --> 21:55.915
And, Reverend,

21:55.948 --> 21:58.418
well, if Jazz Hands ain't
your middle name,

21:58.451 --> 21:59.786
it ought to be.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.320
Aw, stop it.
Yeah.
(laughter)

22:02.455 --> 22:03.556
Come on. Give me a hoot.

22:03.590 --> 22:04.824
Hoot!

22:04.857 --> 22:05.725
Hoot!
Hoot!

22:05.758 --> 22:06.826
Yeah!

22:06.859 --> 22:08.561
(hooting)

22:08.595 --> 22:10.563
One, two, three, four.

22:10.597 --> 22:13.433
* She used to bite her tongue
and hold her breath *

22:13.466 --> 22:14.934
* Scared to rock the boat
and make a mess *

22:14.967 --> 22:17.804
* So she sat quietly

22:17.837 --> 22:19.539
* Agreed politely

22:19.572 --> 22:21.541
* We guess that she forgot

22:21.574 --> 22:24.110
* She had a choice
OWLS:
* There is *

22:24.143 --> 22:28.114
* A brotherhood of man

22:28.147 --> 22:32.452
* A benevolent brotherhood
of man *

22:32.485 --> 22:35.588
* A noble tie that binds

22:35.622 --> 22:37.757
* All human hearts and minds

22:37.790 --> 22:41.828
* Into one brotherhood of

22:41.861 --> 22:44.063
* Man
BELLES:
* We've got the eyes of the *

22:44.096 --> 22:46.098
* Tigers, the fighters

22:46.132 --> 22:48.801
* Dancing through the fires

22:48.835 --> 22:51.471
* 'Cause we are the champions *

22:51.504 --> 22:52.972
* And you're gonna hear *

22:53.005 --> 22:55.875
* Us roar louder

22:55.908 --> 22:58.878
* Louder than a lion

22:58.911 --> 23:01.147
* 'Cause we are the champions *

23:01.180 --> 23:05.117
* And you're gonna
hear me roar *
* Your lifelong membership *

23:05.151 --> 23:07.787
* Is free
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
 oh, oh, oh, oh, oh *

23:07.820 --> 23:11.491
* Keep a-givin'
each brother all *
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh *

23:11.524 --> 23:14.126
* You're gonna hear us roar
* You can, oh, aren't you *

23:14.160 --> 23:18.465
* Proud to be
in that fraternity *
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

23:18.498 --> 23:21.834
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh *
* The great big brotherhood of

23:21.868 --> 23:22.969
* Man
* You're gonna *

23:23.002 --> 23:25.472
* Hear us roar.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.106
(cymbal clashes)
DASH:
 And then Tom Long's

23:27.139 --> 23:29.041
spotlight hits Lavon!

23:29.075 --> 23:32.044
Whoa. Speaking of Tom Long,
there's no show without lights.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.179
Shouldn't he be here?

23:33.212 --> 23:34.581
There's no show without Tom.

23:34.614 --> 23:35.915
He's got the only
lighting system in town!

23:35.948 --> 23:37.550
He's the only one
who understands the light board!

23:37.584 --> 23:40.953
We have to get Tom Long!
We have to find Tom Long!

23:40.987 --> 23:43.923
Wait a minute. I disagree. I
think my life is very complete.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.024
Oh, really?

23:45.057 --> 23:47.193
Well, that's odd because
you spent the entire weekend

23:47.226 --> 23:49.896
listening to Don Todd's
biography on tape,

23:49.929 --> 23:52.499
after the previous weekend in
which you read it to yourself.

23:52.532 --> 23:53.866
Well, it is a different story

23:53.900 --> 23:56.002
when the man himself
reads it to you.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.604
Look, the point is,
this is

23:57.637 --> 24:00.840
a questionable way to get
your restaurant reinspected.

24:00.873 --> 24:03.576
You wasted no time in
finding your dance shoes,
which were conveniently located

24:03.610 --> 24:05.211
by your bedside
next to a CD player

24:05.244 --> 24:07.146
full of rumba classics.

24:07.179 --> 24:09.115
(knocking)
Mae! Come on in.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.884
(quietly):
Daddy, just be nice.
Please. That's all I ask.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.886
I know I'm early,

24:13.920 --> 24:16.523
but I figure we only have
a few hours to rehearse.

24:16.556 --> 24:18.558
Mae, this is my daddy, Brick.

24:18.591 --> 24:20.560
Daddy, this is
Mae Ellen Waterloo,

24:20.593 --> 24:23.229
your dance partner
for this evening.
Wow.

24:23.262 --> 24:26.599
That is a
spectacular gown.

24:26.633 --> 24:29.001
And you are exactly
the right height.
Oh.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.169
(chuckles)
This is...

24:30.202 --> 24:32.004
a dream come true.
(chuckles)

24:32.038 --> 24:32.972
How's your feather step?

24:33.005 --> 24:35.608
Well, in a hyphenated word,

24:35.642 --> 24:36.976
award-winning.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.111
Oh. Good.
(chuckles)

24:39.145 --> 24:40.513
(squeals)

24:42.582 --> 24:43.650
(knocking)

24:44.684 --> 24:46.653
Oh, there she is,

24:46.686 --> 24:48.955
the Edward Snowden
of family secrets.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.122
I am so sorry.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.591
Come in.

24:54.694 --> 24:57.597
Zoe, I-I put you
in a terrible position.

24:57.630 --> 24:59.065
I don't blame you at all.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.167
What is going on?

25:01.200 --> 25:04.671
As you may have heard,
Wade and I had the most

25:04.704 --> 25:06.238
incredible night.
And he was...

25:06.272 --> 25:08.541
romantic and strong...

25:08.575 --> 25:10.009
I don't...
I don't need the details.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.278
But that is great.
Yay, Wade! Right?

25:12.311 --> 25:14.914
But this morning
Charles came by.

25:14.947 --> 25:16.683
And he got
a job offer

25:16.716 --> 25:18.184
in Baton Rouge.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.686
He wants to move.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.287
Wow.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.189
Wait, Charles is going
to Baton Rouge?

25:23.222 --> 25:25.625
That's gonna be hard on Harley.

25:25.658 --> 25:27.627
Oh, no, no.
Zoe, you don't understand.

25:27.660 --> 25:30.029
This is a huge job.

25:30.062 --> 25:32.031
He wants all of us to move.

25:32.064 --> 25:33.933
Charles thinks
that this...

25:33.966 --> 25:35.568
could be our clean slate,

25:35.602 --> 25:37.003
a fresh start.

25:37.036 --> 25:40.206
But, Vivian, you don't love
Charles anymore.

25:40.239 --> 25:42.008
I mean, you've moved on.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.043
But here's the thing.
Uh, the other night,

25:44.076 --> 25:46.078
when he told me
that he still had feelings,

25:46.112 --> 25:49.048
he...
kissed me.

25:49.081 --> 25:51.017
And I kind of...

25:51.050 --> 25:52.284
I kissed him back.

25:52.318 --> 25:55.154
Oh, Vivian.
I know. But we were
high school sweethearts

25:55.187 --> 25:56.355
and he was
my husband.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.157
We have a child together.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.126
Those feelings
just don't go away.

26:00.159 --> 26:01.694
But what about Wade? You know?

26:01.728 --> 26:03.696
(phone ringing)
He's a good guy. He deserves...

26:03.730 --> 26:04.731
Excuse me.

26:04.764 --> 26:07.133
Hey, Winifred, what's up?

26:07.166 --> 26:09.268
(sighs)
Oh, my God.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.070
No, no. Yeah,
I-I'll be right there.

26:11.103 --> 26:14.273
Harley fell off the jungle gym.
He may have a broken arm.

26:14.306 --> 26:15.708
I'll drive.

26:22.081 --> 26:24.583
(sighs, moans)

26:26.085 --> 26:27.353
(exhales)

26:27.386 --> 26:29.321
Psst, Tom.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.057
Mayor Hayes?

26:31.090 --> 26:32.191
I've been leaving you messages,
man.

26:32.224 --> 26:35.061
I turned my phone off.
I have a big night ahead of me.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.229
Wanda says cellular devices
transmit stress.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.766
I am not to be stressed.
O-Okay,

26:39.799 --> 26:41.233
but I need to talk to you
about doing the lights

26:41.267 --> 26:42.635
for the Mayoral Toast and Roast.

26:42.669 --> 26:45.204
Turns out, through a quirk
in the calendar,

26:45.237 --> 26:47.840
the Belles' show is the exact
same night as the Owls'.

26:47.874 --> 26:51.711
Oh, that's gonna put me
in an uncomfortable position.

26:51.744 --> 26:53.345
You know how everybody loves
your lighting design.

26:53.379 --> 26:54.714
ANNABETH:
 We are willing to give you

26:54.747 --> 26:56.382
above-the-title credits.

26:56.415 --> 26:59.085
"Tom Long presents the Head
of the Belles Dinner."

26:59.118 --> 27:01.153
They're talking about making you
an honorary Owl.

27:01.187 --> 27:03.255
For life.
 U-Unlimited babysitting

27:03.289 --> 27:06.258
for baby goats or any humans
that come along.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.526
LAVON:
 You know, I-I'll be okay.

27:07.559 --> 27:11.263
But the rest of the guys will be
very disappointed if you say no.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.799
Very disappointed.

27:12.832 --> 27:15.234
I don't want to upset anyone.
 Well,

27:15.267 --> 27:17.236
then you know what to do.
Because the Belles

27:17.269 --> 27:20.272
would consider it the mother
of all slaps in the face.
So what do you say?

27:20.306 --> 27:22.074
I need an answer, Tom!
(groans)

27:22.108 --> 27:24.711
I-I need some time
I need some time

27:24.744 --> 27:26.746
to think about it.
to think about it.

27:28.380 --> 27:29.415
(grunts)

27:29.448 --> 27:31.851
WOMAN (over P.A.):
 Dr. Kravitz, you have a visitor

27:31.884 --> 27:33.185
in the main lobby.

27:33.219 --> 27:34.286
VIVIAN:
Harley,
sweetie,

27:34.320 --> 27:35.755
are you okay, baby?

27:35.788 --> 27:37.156
Mommy, I fell.

27:37.189 --> 27:40.259
I feel horrible.
I looked away for one second.

27:40.292 --> 27:42.161
It's not your fault.
Things happen.

27:42.194 --> 27:43.696
Buddy, you okay?

27:43.730 --> 27:45.698
Daddy, my arm hurts. My face

27:45.732 --> 27:48.267
is bleeding.
Okay, big guy.

27:48.300 --> 27:49.769
We're gonna sew up
that chin and take

27:49.802 --> 27:51.170
some cool pictures of the inside

27:51.203 --> 27:53.305
of your arm.
I know what an X ray is.

27:53.339 --> 27:55.141
Good for you.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.744
Mom, Dad, one of you want
to come be my assistant?

28:00.379 --> 28:02.381
(foxtrot music playing)

28:17.496 --> 28:19.398
Big finish!

28:21.400 --> 28:22.401
(song ends)
(Lemon yelps)

28:23.469 --> 28:25.872
(both laugh)

28:25.905 --> 28:27.807
Oh, you just...

28:27.840 --> 28:29.308
We're actually good.
It was like

28:29.341 --> 28:30.810
riding a bicycle.

28:30.843 --> 28:33.479
Oh, Mae, you know,
if-if I can survive the evening,

28:33.512 --> 28:35.347
we may do some damage
at this contest.

28:35.381 --> 28:36.182
(laughing):
My gosh.

28:36.215 --> 28:38.150
(phone ringing)
Oh, I better get that.

28:38.184 --> 28:39.351
Uh, don't forget
to hydrate.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.788
Okay.

28:41.821 --> 28:44.190
Well? Someone has got

28:44.223 --> 28:47.326
her sparkle back. Now, that
is the Mae I remember.

28:47.359 --> 28:49.361
Y'all are gonna set
that dance floor on fire.

28:49.395 --> 28:52.398
Yeah, well, hold that thought.
Oh, no.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.300
BRICK:
Mae, I am so sorry to do
this to you. That was

28:54.333 --> 28:57.403
a medical emergency, and I...
I have to attend to it.

28:57.436 --> 29:01.240
But you... you do such
a beautiful box step.

29:01.273 --> 29:02.875
I-I do wish I could go,

29:02.909 --> 29:06.145
'cause I think we could kick
some serious ballroom butt.

29:06.178 --> 29:07.914
(chuckles)
Unfortunately,

29:07.947 --> 29:09.949
duty calls.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.254
That stinks.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.824
Don't despair, Mae.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.358
I have an idea.

29:21.527 --> 29:22.862
(loud whisper):
Tom?

29:22.895 --> 29:25.231
Tom, I got your message.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.398
Tom.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.868
Where are you, man?

29:28.901 --> 29:30.336
Oh, I don't believe this.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.304
Let me guess.
Y-You got a text from Tom,

29:32.338 --> 29:34.406
and it said he had come
to a decision

29:34.440 --> 29:36.208
regarding the lights and...

29:36.242 --> 29:39.211
We should rendezvous at the
gazebo? Yep. Same text.

29:39.245 --> 29:40.412
I think someone's messing
with us.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.448
WANDA:
Good guess, Sherlock.

29:43.449 --> 29:44.817
Wanda?

29:44.851 --> 29:47.486
Yep. Just Wanda.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.421
Disappointing, huh?

29:49.455 --> 29:53.292
How does it feel to show
up somewhere with such

29:53.325 --> 29:56.028
high hopes only to find out

29:56.062 --> 29:58.430
you're not gettin'
what you expected?

29:58.464 --> 30:00.232
Wanda, what's going on?

30:00.266 --> 30:02.935
Are you wearing fishnets?
Yes, I am!
'Cause tonight's

30:02.969 --> 30:05.304
a big night for me and Tom,

30:05.337 --> 30:08.540
a big, big, big night,

30:08.574 --> 30:10.309
which is why
Tom was relaxing

30:10.342 --> 30:12.511
until you two ding-dongs undid
all my doing.

30:12.544 --> 30:15.915
And, hello,
now Tom's so stressed

30:15.948 --> 30:19.585
about who he's supposed to help,
he can't... perform.

30:19.618 --> 30:21.587
Well, guess what.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.489
If he can't perform,

30:23.522 --> 30:27.259
you don't perform.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.561
It was his fault!
It's her fault!

30:29.595 --> 30:31.063
Do I look like I care?

30:31.097 --> 30:32.598
Shut up

30:32.631 --> 30:35.067
and come fix my husband!

30:36.068 --> 30:37.469
Oh...

30:38.504 --> 30:40.272
Hey.

30:40.306 --> 30:41.874
I spoke to the
radiologist,

30:41.908 --> 30:43.375
and Harley's arm
isn't broken.

30:43.409 --> 30:44.576
Oh, thank God.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.412
(chuckles)
Uh, look,

30:46.445 --> 30:48.080
I get how it must look to you.

30:48.114 --> 30:50.082
Okay? I'm the dad
who left his family

30:50.116 --> 30:51.450
and now I want back in.

30:51.483 --> 30:52.919
Look, I don't know you.

30:52.952 --> 30:55.654
But I care about Vivian
and I care about Wade.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.556
And you can't keep just playing

30:57.589 --> 30:59.358
with people's feelings
like this.
No,

30:59.391 --> 31:00.326
I'm not playing.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.628
I've never been more serious
about anything.

31:02.661 --> 31:05.297
Vivian, she's my true love.

31:05.331 --> 31:07.466
All right? All I want to do
is make her remember

31:07.499 --> 31:09.668
how good things were
and can be again.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.603
And I know you and Wade
are close.

31:11.637 --> 31:13.472
And he's a good guy.

31:13.505 --> 31:16.008
But we're a family
and we deserve another chance.

31:17.009 --> 31:19.111
WINIFRED:
Oh, hey.

31:19.145 --> 31:22.514
That's right.
I bought a guilt gift.

31:22.548 --> 31:23.983
And I bought
doughnuts.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.651
What's going on with you two?

31:25.684 --> 31:26.652
Nothing.

31:26.685 --> 31:27.519
No.

31:27.553 --> 31:28.587
Come on. Let's sit.

31:30.990 --> 31:33.960
Lemon?

31:33.993 --> 31:35.962
I think I'm gonna go.

31:35.995 --> 31:38.464
Tell your dad thanks for trying.

31:38.497 --> 31:41.000
LEMON:
Wait!

31:41.033 --> 31:43.535
*

31:46.538 --> 31:48.007
That is so sweet.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.408
(giggling)

31:49.441 --> 31:50.409
I don't think
it'll work, though.

31:50.442 --> 31:52.711
I mean, neither one of us
knows how to lead.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.581
Oh, honey, speak for yourself.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.984
*

32:00.086 --> 32:03.122
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Kravitz, you have a visitor
in the main lobby.

32:03.155 --> 32:05.124
Daddy, I had stitches!

32:05.157 --> 32:07.526
Oh. Come here,
my brave guy.

32:07.559 --> 32:08.961
Oh!

32:08.995 --> 32:10.162
Just glad
you're all right.

32:10.196 --> 32:11.463
I love you.

32:11.497 --> 32:12.598
I love you, too.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.600
VIVIAN:
My, don't forget about me.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.502
Yeah. Let me
see. Lift up?

32:16.535 --> 32:18.037
Yeah.
That hurt?

32:18.070 --> 32:19.071
No, not
anymore.

32:19.105 --> 32:20.072
Oh, real
tough guy.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.507
Huh?
VIVIAN:
Very.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.509
(laughter)

32:23.542 --> 32:25.577
CHARLES:
We got to get him back out
on the diamond.

32:25.611 --> 32:26.979
You should see him hit a ball...
VIVIAN:
Maybe let's not...

32:27.013 --> 32:28.080
Are you okay?

32:28.114 --> 32:30.049
Oh, yeah.

32:30.082 --> 32:32.084
(indistinct chatter)

32:32.118 --> 32:35.554
Could you just...
tell them that I had to go?

32:43.129 --> 32:45.164
(laughs)
Amazingness.

32:45.197 --> 32:47.133
Kicked out of two
clubs in one night.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.001
Yeah, see,
that's gonna happen when

32:49.035 --> 32:51.103
you insist on calling a bouncer
"Tiny" repeatedly.

32:51.137 --> 32:52.504
That's...
(laughter)

32:52.538 --> 32:55.641
Bouncers-- you know, just
no appreciation for irony.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.676
At all. None.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.481
Tequila makes me hungry.

33:02.514 --> 33:04.616
Where can a girl
get a snack?

33:04.650 --> 33:07.086
Well, miss, it is
your lucky night,

33:07.119 --> 33:08.754
because I happen
to know a gentleman

33:08.787 --> 33:10.756
who owns half a restaurant.

33:10.789 --> 33:12.158
Really?
Yeah.

33:12.191 --> 33:13.692
Come on.

33:13.725 --> 33:15.027
I just don't
know what to do.

33:15.061 --> 33:16.495
I mean, it's right
there in the Bible.

33:16.528 --> 33:18.130
"Let there be light." But it
doesn't say who gets the light.

33:18.164 --> 33:19.765
Lavon, A.B.-- they're both
my friends, but I don't...

33:19.798 --> 33:22.101
Tom. Tom, Tom,
you are babbling again.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.769
Now, think about
the calming ocean

33:23.802 --> 33:26.572
and waves lapping
on the shore.

33:26.605 --> 33:27.706
Can you hear that?

33:27.739 --> 33:30.142
I do. I do.
Of course, now I have

33:30.176 --> 33:32.244
to pee.
Oh.

33:32.278 --> 33:34.580
Look at him!
Look at what y'all did!

33:34.613 --> 33:36.448
Wanda, yelling is
counterproductive.
Sorry.

33:36.482 --> 33:38.717
It's not me. It's
my ovaries yelling.

33:38.750 --> 33:41.220
Hey, buddy.
How we doing?

33:41.253 --> 33:43.122
Work faster!

33:43.155 --> 33:44.356
Okay, uh, listen
to me, Tom.

33:44.390 --> 33:46.525
I don't want you to worry
about the lights anymore, okay?

33:46.558 --> 33:48.227
Go and do the
Belle Show.
No, no,
do the Owl show.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.528
Another choice?

33:49.561 --> 33:50.662
What if maybe...

33:50.696 --> 33:52.131
We combine our shows

33:52.164 --> 33:53.232
and-and we do 'em together?

33:53.265 --> 33:54.600
Maybe we do them outside

33:54.633 --> 33:55.767
during the day,
and we won't

33:55.801 --> 33:56.802
even need lights at all!

33:56.835 --> 33:58.170
So, now you don't
want my lights?

33:58.204 --> 33:59.571
Okay.
ANNABETH:
No, no, no.

33:59.605 --> 34:01.240
We love... we love
your lights. Um, we just...

34:01.273 --> 34:02.574
We don't want you
to be concerned.

34:02.608 --> 34:03.842
LAVON:
Right. The only spotlight

34:03.875 --> 34:06.145
you should be worried
about is the one

34:06.178 --> 34:08.547
that you're gonna
use... to make a baby.

34:08.580 --> 34:09.715
BRICK:
What?

34:09.748 --> 34:11.449
Ew, Lavon.

34:11.483 --> 34:14.085
No. That worked.

34:15.286 --> 34:17.456
Okay, good enough for me.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.525
I love y'all,
but everybody out!

34:19.558 --> 34:20.626
Oh.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.094
Now!

34:27.733 --> 34:29.201
You know I love you.

34:29.235 --> 34:31.770
I do. I... Mm.

34:31.803 --> 34:34.172
Mmm.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.208
(goat bleats)

34:37.743 --> 34:39.545
Out!

34:40.879 --> 34:43.282
(sighs)

34:43.315 --> 34:44.683
(whooping)

34:44.716 --> 34:45.884
Ah!

34:45.917 --> 34:47.619
Ah!

34:47.652 --> 34:50.255
(humming)

34:50.289 --> 34:51.723
(laughter)

34:51.757 --> 34:53.259
Seventh place!

34:53.292 --> 34:54.726
It's a miracle.

34:54.760 --> 34:55.827
I know.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.229
Oh, Lemon,

34:57.263 --> 34:58.630
I can't thank you enough.

34:58.664 --> 35:00.199
Tonight has been

35:00.232 --> 35:02.534
a dream come true.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.736
I only hope one day
I can return the favor.

35:04.770 --> 35:05.871
Well,

35:05.904 --> 35:09.241
now that you mention it,
you could reinspect Fancie's.

35:09.275 --> 35:10.776
Sure. Let's do it.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.744
Really? But it's after midnight.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.346
I'll never be in a happier mood.

35:14.380 --> 35:17.183
Well... let's go.

35:17.216 --> 35:18.717
Okay, come on.

35:20.586 --> 35:21.753
(playing gentle melody)

35:21.787 --> 35:22.888
(knocking)

35:22.921 --> 35:25.724
Hey.

35:25.757 --> 35:27.626
Hey, Doc. Where you been?

35:27.659 --> 35:28.760
The hospital.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.329
Harley fell off the jungle gym.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.764
But he's okay.
He just needed some stitches.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.233
Geez Louise, poor kid.

35:34.266 --> 35:36.335
Uh, you know, I should...
I should call Viv.

35:36.368 --> 35:38.270
You know what? They're...
They're probably exhausted.

35:38.304 --> 35:40.239
Right. Yeah, yeah.

35:40.272 --> 35:42.841
Hey, uh, did you...
did you have a chance

35:42.874 --> 35:44.710
to put in a word for me?

35:44.743 --> 35:46.912
I didn't.
Okay, well, uh,

35:46.945 --> 35:48.547
no rush, I guess.

35:48.580 --> 35:52.651
Actually, Wade, I don't think
there's much of a point.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.386
What do you mean?

35:54.420 --> 35:56.688
(clears throat)

35:56.722 --> 35:58.290
Okay, look,

35:58.324 --> 36:00.359
I'm your friend,

36:00.392 --> 36:03.195
so that's why I think
this should come from me.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.832
I don't see this
turning out for you.

36:07.966 --> 36:11.169
Charles and Vivian
are getting back together.

36:11.970 --> 36:14.340
No.

36:14.373 --> 36:18.277
No, I mean, Viv-Viv and I--
we-we have... we have something.

36:18.310 --> 36:19.811
We have something real.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.813
No, I-I'm sure you do.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.283
Just, Charles is moving away,

36:24.316 --> 36:26.785
and eventually
Vivian's going to go with him.

36:26.818 --> 36:28.820
You know, Wade, I saw them
all together tonight...

36:28.854 --> 36:30.289
Wow. You know, uh,

36:30.322 --> 36:32.591
on second thought, Zoe,

36:32.624 --> 36:35.394
I... I don't think
I need your help anymore.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.830
Excuse me.

36:39.865 --> 36:41.867
Wade.

36:44.270 --> 36:46.272
(door slams)

36:48.674 --> 36:50.242
It already
looks great.
Oh. (laughs)

36:50.276 --> 36:52.644
No condiments left on
the tables, unrefrigerated.

36:52.678 --> 36:53.745
(laughs)

36:53.779 --> 36:55.247
(clinking)

36:55.281 --> 36:57.283
What was that?

36:57.316 --> 36:59.951
(dishes and glassware
clattering and clinking)

36:59.985 --> 37:01.853
Sounds like some
kind of animal.

37:01.887 --> 37:02.954
(laughs)

37:02.988 --> 37:06.292
No, trust me, there are
no animals in this restaurant.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.662
GEORGE:
You're gonna get it now.

37:10.696 --> 37:12.364
LULABELLE:
Stop it! Get away! Don't do it!

37:12.398 --> 37:13.799
GEORGE (laughing):
Oh, you are gonna get it now.

37:13.832 --> 37:14.966
If you do it,
I'm gonna get you back then.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.435
I'm gonna get you.
You are gonna get it.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.036
You are gonna get it.
I am. Watch this.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.838
GEORGE: Are you kidding me?
LULABELLE:
No, I'm not. Stop.

37:19.871 --> 37:21.006
You are gonna get it.
(laughing)

37:21.039 --> 37:23.742
I'm gonna get you.
(laughing)

37:23.775 --> 37:26.278
(chuckles softly)

37:26.312 --> 37:27.979
I stand corrected.

37:28.013 --> 37:31.483
Whipped cream, anyone?

37:40.025 --> 37:42.361
Dr. Breeland, Wanda and
I just wanted to say

37:42.394 --> 37:44.363
thank you for your
help last night.

37:44.396 --> 37:45.864
Well, it's not
your typical house call,

37:45.897 --> 37:47.032
but I am here to serve.

37:47.065 --> 37:50.035
The visualizing
helped quite a bit.

37:50.068 --> 37:51.903
This mind is a
very powerful tool.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.038
(laughs)

37:53.071 --> 37:54.373
Very powerful.

37:54.406 --> 37:55.240
WANDA:
Dr. Breeland doesn't want

37:55.273 --> 37:57.909
to hear about your tools
over breakfast.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.379
Anyway, hope to be
seeing a lot more of you

38:00.412 --> 38:01.747
in the next nine months.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.349
Fingers crossed.

38:05.417 --> 38:06.818
Hmm.

38:07.986 --> 38:11.957
Uh, look, A.B., I know I
apologized about being a jackass

38:11.990 --> 38:15.394
about your new boyfriend,
but I also know

38:15.427 --> 38:16.962
that I wouldn't have
accepted my apology either.

38:16.995 --> 38:18.830
I stepped over the line.

38:18.864 --> 38:21.066
I wish I hadn't.

38:21.099 --> 38:24.002
But I-I hope that we
can be friends again.

38:24.035 --> 38:26.338
I guess we kind of have to,

38:26.372 --> 38:28.874
if only for the sake
of the town, right?

38:33.412 --> 38:36.348
LulaBelle tells me she had
a great time last night.

38:36.382 --> 38:39.084
She also said y'all managed
to get in some Bible study.

38:39.117 --> 38:40.386
Is that true?

38:40.419 --> 38:42.053
She wouldn't lie
to a man of the cloth.

38:42.087 --> 38:43.154
Would she? We-we had a...
a great time,

38:43.188 --> 38:45.457
and I wanted to thank you
for the introduction.
Mm.

38:45.491 --> 38:48.427
'Cause, as it turns out,
a-a little bit of, uh,

38:48.460 --> 38:50.929
Bible study is-is
all I needed.

38:50.962 --> 38:52.097
Well, that's a good thing,

38:52.130 --> 38:54.466
'cause that sheep
you were talking about?

38:54.500 --> 38:56.368
She's...
(à la sheep): baaack!

38:57.869 --> 38:59.871
Our new health inspection
report came in.

38:59.905 --> 39:02.741
You want to guess
what we got?

39:02.774 --> 39:04.109
We got a "C," George!

39:04.142 --> 39:05.176
A "C" for
health, thanks

39:05.210 --> 39:07.813
to you and your culinary
debauchery in the kitchen!

39:07.846 --> 39:09.915
I had to sweet-talk
her out of an "F"!

39:09.948 --> 39:11.883
Well, that's... I mean,
well, that's good news.

39:11.917 --> 39:12.984
(laughing):
Silver linings.

39:13.018 --> 39:14.119
Oh, you think
that this is funny?!

39:14.152 --> 39:16.422
No.
Then why are
you smiling?

39:16.455 --> 39:18.424
(laughing):
Because I...

39:18.457 --> 39:21.393
I am highly annoyed
with you right now.

39:21.427 --> 39:22.928
That's all I am feeling

39:22.961 --> 39:25.497
is a... is a very high level
of annoyance.

39:25.531 --> 39:26.898
La-dee-dee-da and
happy day for you.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.867
George, you own that "C."
That "C" is all your fault.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.035
And you better start thinking

39:30.068 --> 39:31.136
about how you're gonna
raise that grade.

39:31.169 --> 39:33.472
Will do, Lemon. I got it.

39:33.505 --> 39:34.606
George, where are you going?

39:34.640 --> 39:37.476
I am not done with you yet.

39:37.509 --> 39:38.944
(knocking)

39:40.078 --> 39:41.112
What are you doing here?

39:41.146 --> 39:42.481
What are you doing here?

39:42.514 --> 39:44.015
Didn't Vivian call you?

39:44.049 --> 39:45.484
Yeah, she left a
message, said to call.

39:45.517 --> 39:46.918
I figured I'd just
stop by in person.

39:46.952 --> 39:48.454
Oh, God.

39:48.487 --> 39:51.056
Hey, Viv?

39:52.991 --> 39:55.160
Wade, Vivian--

39:55.193 --> 39:59.030
she went away for the
weekend... with Charles.

39:59.064 --> 40:01.032
They're looking for
houses in Baton Rouge,

40:01.066 --> 40:03.602
and I'm watching Harley
while she's gone.

40:03.635 --> 40:05.971
Went out of town with Charles?

40:07.639 --> 40:09.841
No. No way. I don't believe you.

40:09.875 --> 40:11.076
I'm so sorry.

40:13.211 --> 40:15.180
You're sorry?

40:15.213 --> 40:18.183
You could have stopped this.
She would have listened to you.

40:18.216 --> 40:19.618
That is not fair, Wade.

40:19.651 --> 40:21.086
What was I supposed to do?

40:21.119 --> 40:23.088
One favor, Zoe.

40:23.121 --> 40:25.090
I asked you one favor.

40:25.123 --> 40:27.225
After everything
we've been through.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.627
But I saw
what you were up against,

40:28.660 --> 40:29.895
and it wouldn't have worked.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.630
No, no, that wasn't
your call to make!

40:31.663 --> 40:33.499
Shh.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.534
Hey, Wade.

40:35.567 --> 40:37.536
Hey.

40:37.569 --> 40:39.237
Hey,

40:39.270 --> 40:40.906
little buddy.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.008
Uh... wow.

40:43.041 --> 40:45.043
Look at those
stitches.

40:45.076 --> 40:47.946
I, uh... I got you something.

40:47.979 --> 40:50.115
Whoa!

40:50.148 --> 40:52.083
It's just like yours?

40:52.117 --> 40:54.553
Yeah, remote control and
everything. Hope you like it.

40:54.586 --> 40:57.022
Awesome. Thank you.

40:57.055 --> 40:59.224
Hey,

40:59.257 --> 41:00.592
did you hear?

41:00.626 --> 41:02.193
We're moving to Baton Rouge.

41:03.595 --> 41:06.598
Wow.

41:06.632 --> 41:09.134
Yeah. Yeah,
you know, that's...

41:09.167 --> 41:10.235
that's a great place.

41:10.268 --> 41:11.937
I think you'll really like it.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.104
Yeah.

41:13.138 --> 41:15.006
Um... you know,

41:15.040 --> 41:17.008
I should... I should...
I should get going.

41:17.042 --> 41:18.610
So, uh,

41:18.644 --> 41:22.180
I'll see you later, all right?

41:22.213 --> 41:24.115
All right.
All right.

41:24.149 --> 41:26.151
Yeah.
