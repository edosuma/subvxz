Hi, Jenna!

00:52.450 --> 00:53.450
Okay.

00:54.550 --> 00:56.050
Let's hear your song first.

00:57.950 --> 00:58.950
Okay.

00:59.520 --> 01:02.260
Bring it to my studio tomorrow. Yeah.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.090
Okay.

01:14.070 --> 01:15.340
A new song?

01:19.110 --> 01:20.810
You don't have to worry.

01:21.780 --> 01:24.210
I'll drag out the time and finish them.

01:24.210 --> 01:25.510
What do you mean?

01:25.510 --> 01:28.050
There's a direction Jenna wants to go.

01:28.350 --> 01:30.020
I'm going to make it in a different way.

01:30.020 --> 01:31.890
We'll go back and forth several times.

01:31.890 --> 01:33.289
Their schedule will get screwed.

01:33.289 --> 01:35.789
They won't even get near a recording booth.

01:36.460 --> 01:37.430
Simple, right?

01:37.759 --> 01:40.060
You don't need to take action.

01:40.530 --> 01:42.300
They'll just give up

01:42.300 --> 01:44.770
and look for another producer.

01:47.039 --> 01:48.340
Give up on me?

01:49.910 --> 01:52.009
They will never do that.

01:52.440 --> 01:54.280
Come on. I'm Bbiyong.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.610
Even if I write a song with my feet,

01:55.610 --> 01:57.610
they'll take it because they need my name.

01:57.610 --> 02:01.750
If I solve this, buy me an expensive dinner.

02:03.850 --> 02:04.950
He told you?

02:05.290 --> 02:06.660
He told you to do it?

02:07.960 --> 02:08.960
Yeah.

02:09.560 --> 02:12.760
He told me to drag it out, then finish you.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.100
That was the agency's strategy, Sir.

02:17.170 --> 02:20.070
I just did what you told me to.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.770
Why are you making me out to be the bad guy?

02:26.340 --> 02:29.240
So in an attempt to kill

02:29.240 --> 02:31.380
one puny failed idol group,

02:31.380 --> 02:33.620
the CEO and executive pitched in.

02:33.620 --> 02:35.020
Went so low as to plot a scheme?

02:35.020 --> 02:36.750
How could you do that?

02:37.120 --> 02:37.950
Huh?

02:37.950 --> 02:39.890
How could you do that?

02:41.790 --> 02:42.760
Let's go.

02:58.510 --> 02:59.540
Darn it.

03:02.610 --> 03:04.080
Why are we leaving?

03:04.080 --> 03:05.850
We should smack them.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.120
What a crappy world!

03:09.350 --> 03:10.520
Kim Jenna!

03:11.520 --> 03:12.750
Kim Jenna!

03:12.990 --> 03:14.390
I need to talk with you.

03:15.590 --> 03:16.730
Why?

03:16.730 --> 03:19.490
Are you now feeling a tsunami of shame?

03:21.660 --> 03:22.700
Look at you!

03:22.700 --> 03:24.600
Are you glaring at me?

03:24.600 --> 03:26.870
You have no shame at all, do you?

03:26.870 --> 03:27.940
Hyun-ji.

03:28.870 --> 03:30.170
Wait here.

03:37.480 --> 03:39.650
That psychopath!

03:44.650 --> 03:46.320
I'll be brief.

03:46.320 --> 03:48.760
- I'm not that kind of...
- I don't owe you anything anymore.

03:49.690 --> 03:51.590
I deceived you as well.

03:52.090 --> 03:53.329
If we're talking about bad character,

03:53.329 --> 03:54.900
you and I are the same.

03:54.900 --> 03:56.700
- Kim Jenna.
- Don't apologize.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.170
If you do, then I'll still owe you.

03:59.670 --> 04:02.000
Let's just

04:02.470 --> 04:04.270
wipe the slate clean, okay?

04:07.340 --> 04:08.980
I can't do that.

04:08.980 --> 04:10.780
How are we the same?

04:10.780 --> 04:12.210
What you did was a felony!

04:12.210 --> 04:14.780
- Sexual harassment, blackmail...
- Sir!

04:16.519 --> 04:18.620
Then what you did...

04:19.350 --> 04:21.060
was attempted murder.

04:21.560 --> 04:22.290
What?

04:22.290 --> 04:24.060
Just as you wished,

04:24.760 --> 04:27.100
my heart almost burst.

04:31.730 --> 04:34.770
You shouldn't have sent that text earlier.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.640
You don't have to set up a double trap.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.680
I know you're formidable.

05:58.960 --> 06:02.690
Part 6
Troy

06:02.760 --> 06:05.730
Don't you know about silent affirmation?

06:07.430 --> 06:08.200
I told him I'd do that.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.170
He didn't say anything, so he okayed it.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.570
Don't you watch movies?

06:11.570 --> 06:13.170
Bosses don't say

06:13.170 --> 06:15.440
yes or no. That's so lame.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.210
Forget about CEO Cha.

06:17.870 --> 06:19.670
You didn't have to do that.

06:20.980 --> 06:23.310
I had to. Because it's me.

06:23.310 --> 06:25.450
Because of my responsibility as an executive.

06:25.810 --> 06:28.620
Because of them, we're being looked down on, too.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.550
How can I stand by and watch?

06:30.550 --> 06:31.550
Bbiyong!

06:33.560 --> 06:35.520
That's enough. Let's just talk about work.

06:37.260 --> 06:38.860
Whenever I see them,

06:38.930 --> 06:41.530
it feels like something's stuck in my teeth.

06:41.530 --> 06:43.030
Just drop it!

06:43.830 --> 06:45.330
Find another producer?

06:45.330 --> 06:48.140
It will probably be a nobody.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.840
Don't get involved. Focus on your unit.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.480
Make me proud

06:53.880 --> 06:55.909
that I allowed you to be my co-producer.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.200
The wind is moist.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.630
It's going to rain.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.400
It's nothing we didn't expect.

07:24.640 --> 07:28.540
The world wouldn't be so easy on us.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.430
You can bloom later.

07:49.830 --> 07:51.930
As long as you put down your roots well.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.370
How much will it rain?

07:56.740 --> 07:57.909
Should I bring it inside?

08:00.310 --> 08:01.780
Leave it.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.050
It survived all that wind and rain.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.910
If the environment changes suddenly, it'll die.

08:06.650 --> 08:08.880
Wow, this little thing.

08:09.080 --> 08:11.190
I should stick in a nutritional supplement.

08:11.190 --> 08:13.960
Oh! I guess Chae-ah won't be coming today.

08:14.320 --> 08:15.690
Her mom called her.

08:15.990 --> 08:19.090
Why take her to see Chae-ryeong get an award?

08:22.230 --> 08:23.100
Huh?

08:23.630 --> 08:25.300
This one will bloom.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.640
You're right!

08:29.070 --> 08:30.210
I'm glad.

08:31.070 --> 08:32.169
Jenna.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.840
This is the same age as us.

08:36.780 --> 08:38.710
Thanks for withstanding everything.

08:38.710 --> 08:40.220
Thanks for growing well.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.880
You held out well.

08:41.880 --> 08:42.950
Yeah.

08:57.800 --> 08:58.900
This is great.

09:02.540 --> 09:08.080
You know sometimes

09:09.210 --> 09:15.120
I wish I'm that rising sun

09:16.050 --> 09:22.290
Not knowing what darkness is

09:22.620 --> 09:28.360
I want to be bright sunlight

09:30.330 --> 09:33.840
When my heart is like cold winter

09:33.840 --> 09:35.070
I'm home.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.540
Oh! You're here!

09:37.540 --> 09:39.710
Tough day?

09:40.710 --> 09:42.240
Jenna is singing.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.280
Yeah.

09:45.880 --> 09:47.450
I gave my mom the car.

09:47.450 --> 09:49.680
It's okay. We can walk.

09:50.850 --> 09:56.360
Languidly, I want to hold you

09:58.090 --> 10:00.430
It's been long since I heard her sing.

10:00.430 --> 10:01.800
Right?

10:02.230 --> 10:03.470
It's good.

10:05.330 --> 10:12.810
Riding on the wind, I hope it gets to you

10:12.810 --> 10:18.180
Even if the times are exhausting

10:19.480 --> 10:26.790
Our warmth created by holding hands

10:26.790 --> 10:36.600
I hope it gets to your cheeks, your fingertips

11:02.160 --> 11:07.360
Whenever I hurt

11:08.430 --> 11:13.740
I remember that warmth

11:15.000 --> 11:22.580
Even if we're facing different things

11:22.580 --> 11:28.420
I can always stop crying

11:30.520 --> 11:34.990
The memory of a snug fragrance

11:37.060 --> 11:44.600
Riding on the wind, I hope it gets to you

11:44.600 --> 11:49.770
Even if the times are exhausting

11:51.270 --> 11:58.580
Our warmth created by holding hands

11:58.580 --> 12:07.860
I hope it gets to your cheeks, your fingertips

12:11.760 --> 12:14.360
I hope it gets to you

12:15.460 --> 12:18.360
I put the chorus in front of the verse once.

12:18.530 --> 12:21.070
BPM 120 felt too relaxed, so I changed it

12:21.070 --> 12:22.470
to 140.

12:22.470 --> 12:23.940
In the hook, I wanted

12:23.940 --> 12:25.650
the synth to play the base line.

12:25.670 --> 12:27.540
So I was thinking pizzicato.

12:27.840 --> 12:29.280
What do you think?

12:30.680 --> 12:31.680
Okay.

12:32.050 --> 12:33.450
Listen to it and let me know.

12:33.450 --> 12:34.450
Bye.

12:37.550 --> 12:39.690
Wow, it's exquisite.

12:39.850 --> 12:41.520
Your color has become more distinct,

12:41.520 --> 12:43.560
but the originality of the song is intact.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.030
I think Bbiyong will love it, too.

12:45.030 --> 12:47.000
I need to touch up on the details more.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.900
You're working hard, even though it's Bbiyong's.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.670
It's a surprise Bbiyong allowed co-producing, too.

12:57.270 --> 12:59.040
They sent a rough cue sheet for the show.

12:59.670 --> 13:00.540
Oh!

13:00.780 --> 13:02.240
You got your solo choreography, right?

13:02.240 --> 13:03.080
Yeah.

13:03.280 --> 13:04.850
I'll go and start practicing.

13:04.850 --> 13:05.780
Okay.

13:06.350 --> 13:07.220
Take your time.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.220
Okay.

13:21.930 --> 13:23.610
Is your ankle okay now?

13:23.800 --> 13:25.330
That was a long time ago.

13:25.330 --> 13:27.740
I heard you're having fun with the unit project.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.000
You're working hard.

13:30.340 --> 13:32.470
I like the title song better than I thought.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.040
Yeah?

13:39.710 --> 13:41.420
There will be trouble with Lune.

13:41.420 --> 13:44.290
Asking you to feature was an act of good will.

13:44.290 --> 13:45.620
She'll be hurt.

13:45.620 --> 13:47.790
She's not such a petty person.

13:48.190 --> 13:49.990
Her contract is up for renewal.

13:49.990 --> 13:52.090
She'll think the agency isn't competent.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.130
You know, right?

13:54.600 --> 13:57.630
She has the second biggest sales after Mars.

14:22.270 --> 14:23.290
What is it?

14:23.290 --> 14:24.360
You changed your mind?

14:24.360 --> 14:25.360
No.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.470
Don't you feel apologetic toward Jenna?

14:31.670 --> 14:33.500
Did you have to go that far?

14:33.640 --> 14:35.670
That's not pride or anything.

14:36.770 --> 14:38.110
It's just mean.

14:38.110 --> 14:40.510
Weren't you stabbed in the back?

14:40.780 --> 14:41.940
I'm upset with her.

14:42.310 --> 14:44.510
But I can't help but feel sorry for her.

14:44.510 --> 14:45.810
Pick a stance

14:46.010 --> 14:48.580
and stick to it. Don't confuse people.

14:57.890 --> 14:59.330
Will the outcome change

15:01.360 --> 15:02.860
based on what I decide?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.740
Yes. It changes.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.510
That way, I can decide whether to

15:12.510 --> 15:14.080
keep my father's will or not.

15:15.180 --> 15:16.480
What if I say I like you?

15:16.480 --> 15:17.880
Then I will, begrudgingly,

15:17.880 --> 15:19.080
embrace you as my family.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.480
And if I say I hate you?

15:21.480 --> 15:23.220
I'll happily kick you out.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.220
Do whatever you want.

15:26.820 --> 15:28.790
I don't want to be your family anyway.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.070
You're so frank.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.070
Why didn't you tell Jenna the truth?

15:46.820 --> 15:48.940
Bbiyong did it on his own accord.

15:49.940 --> 15:51.710
The agency didn't know about it.

15:52.250 --> 15:54.650
I know you're not covering for Bbiyong.

15:56.850 --> 15:58.720
Because she said her heart almost burst.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.360
I want to make it burst, so she'll give up.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.500
Thanks for the coffee.

16:20.110 --> 16:21.110
Jenna.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.040
Won't it be meaningful if you do

16:23.040 --> 16:24.580
the producing as well?

16:25.380 --> 16:26.980
We need more than meaning.

16:26.980 --> 16:28.820
What Bbiyong said isn't all wrong.

16:28.820 --> 16:31.290
We really do need a famous name.

16:31.650 --> 16:32.850
No famous name

16:33.090 --> 16:34.720
will do it for us.

16:34.720 --> 16:38.760
Yeah, unless we have a boatload of money.

16:40.930 --> 16:42.600
There is one person.

16:43.300 --> 16:44.530
- Who?
- Who?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Troy.

16:48.870 --> 16:50.170
- Huh?
- What?

17:31.510 --> 17:32.910
- Troy!
- Troy!

17:32.910 --> 17:34.250
- Troy!
- Troy!

17:34.250 --> 17:35.580
- Troy!
- Troy!

17:35.580 --> 17:38.450
- Troy!
- Troy!

17:41.890 --> 17:42.860
Happy?

17:43.020 --> 17:43.760
Bye.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.290
You're not eating it?

17:46.330 --> 17:47.830
Stop feeding us cake.

17:47.830 --> 17:50.160
And stop getting awards.

17:50.260 --> 17:50.800
Now it's just tiresome.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.530
This is how the world treats a genius.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.040
What can I do? Huh?

17:55.040 --> 17:56.540
It's hard for me, too.

17:57.440 --> 17:58.510
Do you know

17:58.510 --> 17:59.980
the hard work that goes into

17:59.980 --> 18:01.710
getting another award?

18:02.680 --> 18:04.480
When do we go to the Grammys?

18:04.480 --> 18:06.410
They have to call us to go.

18:06.410 --> 18:07.550
If we go to the Grammys,

18:07.550 --> 18:09.220
I'll take off my pants and shout.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.150
Oh, I see.

18:12.290 --> 18:14.660
You're not talented enough to go to the Grammys.

18:14.660 --> 18:15.560
Right?

18:15.560 --> 18:17.260
Huh? Hey!

18:17.660 --> 18:20.760
Wow... Those jerks.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.130
Seriously.

18:23.260 --> 18:26.570
I have good luck in awards but none in employees.

18:36.010 --> 18:37.510
God Troy!

18:51.290 --> 18:52.360
Troy?

18:52.590 --> 18:53.860
No way.

18:53.860 --> 18:54.660
Jenna!

18:56.200 --> 18:57.970
Are you still in shock because of Bbiyong?

18:58.670 --> 18:59.670
Jenna.

18:59.870 --> 19:01.170
We can't go to Troy.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.100
Don't even think about it.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.070
Let's just

19:03.070 --> 19:04.970
go back to Bbiyong.

19:08.540 --> 19:10.380
There's no way Troy will do it.

19:10.380 --> 19:11.780
Did you forget what happened?

19:11.780 --> 19:13.750
He will never

19:13.750 --> 19:15.150
take our work.

19:15.150 --> 19:17.290
Never! Never!

19:26.830 --> 19:28.800
Troy wrote this?

19:42.080 --> 19:42.980
Hey.

19:43.410 --> 19:44.510
Hi.

19:47.010 --> 19:48.550
Troy!

19:48.550 --> 19:49.380
Huh?

19:50.990 --> 19:52.020
It's so good.

19:52.020 --> 19:52.690
Really?

19:52.690 --> 19:53.850
Yeah!

19:54.390 --> 19:55.490
I like it, too.

19:55.890 --> 19:56.460
Me, too.

19:56.460 --> 19:58.260
It's so catchy.

20:02.530 --> 20:05.200
This will be the 6th track in our album?

20:05.200 --> 20:08.240
Yes. It's still lacking,

20:08.240 --> 20:10.500
but I did my best, so please be kind.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.310
I'm so happy I'm debuting with your album.

20:14.810 --> 20:17.650
It's good you changed directions.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.180
With these skills, you shouldn't be a trainee.

20:20.450 --> 20:21.450
Right.

20:25.990 --> 20:27.460
When it goes viral, treat us to dinner.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.090
Of course.

20:31.160 --> 20:34.630
Doesn't the intro sound like Minx?

20:34.630 --> 20:36.300
I thought so, too.

20:36.300 --> 20:37.570
And the chorus.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.800
It feels like I've sung it before.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.700
The dance break part as well.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.400
I'm reminded of "Beautiful Sunday."

20:43.400 --> 20:46.070
Did he take pieces from here and there?

20:46.070 --> 20:46.840
That's plagiarism.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.940
Well, it's not outright plagiarism.

20:50.380 --> 20:53.250
But it does remind me of a lot of other songs.

20:53.250 --> 20:56.720
He made a song that's borderline plagiarism.

20:56.720 --> 20:57.350
But I didn't...

20:57.350 --> 20:59.250
I heard CEO Ma picked this song.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.790
Shouldn't we tell him?

21:00.790 --> 21:02.360
This is so annoying!

21:02.360 --> 21:03.920
How can he do this?

21:03.920 --> 21:05.760
Does he want to ruin our debut?

21:05.760 --> 21:08.130
I'm going to boycott this song.

21:08.130 --> 21:09.160
Me, too!

21:11.410 --> 21:12.450
But I didn't...

21:15.540 --> 21:16.740
What are you doing here?

21:28.750 --> 21:29.650
Hey!

21:29.650 --> 21:31.590
He left the agency because of us.

21:31.590 --> 21:33.450
He went through so much hardship after that.

21:33.450 --> 21:34.860
But you still want to ask for help?

21:34.860 --> 21:36.240
Let's not.

21:36.270 --> 21:38.090
We have no right.

21:38.290 --> 21:40.230
You'll only be humiliated, Jenna.

21:43.230 --> 21:44.100
I'll give it a go.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.670
Did you listen to it? Yeah.

21:47.270 --> 21:49.870
About the verse,

21:49.970 --> 21:52.740
I want to change the sound of the synth.

21:52.920 --> 21:53.870
Yeah.

21:54.680 --> 21:55.740
Right, right.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.240
And when you go into the hook.

21:59.210 --> 22:01.180
Isn't it weird? The snap sound?

22:02.680 --> 22:05.620
Yeah, change the snap sound. Yeah.

22:10.260 --> 22:11.590
I'll call you back.

22:15.530 --> 22:16.730
It's been a long time.

22:22.100 --> 22:23.470
Kim Jenna.

22:36.150 --> 22:37.220
Wow.

22:40.450 --> 22:42.420
I guess I really did make it.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.830
We shouldn't have sent her there alone.

22:53.730 --> 22:55.040
Come on.

22:55.060 --> 22:56.710
It'll be fine...

22:56.740 --> 22:58.810
Remember how tender-hearted and gentle he was?

22:58.810 --> 23:01.980
And he's really successful now. Right?

23:01.980 --> 23:03.610
Yeah, that's right!

23:04.250 --> 23:06.380
With success, people get more generous.

23:06.380 --> 23:09.080
Right! My grandma always said,

23:09.080 --> 23:11.420
generosity comes from the storage!

23:11.420 --> 23:12.390
Right!

23:18.590 --> 23:20.460
Wow, seriously.

23:21.130 --> 23:22.630
That's the most hilarious thing

23:22.630 --> 23:24.230
I've heard recently.

23:24.230 --> 23:25.330
So you are

23:25.330 --> 23:27.270
asking me to produce

23:27.290 --> 23:28.980
your second album?

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Me?

23:34.500 --> 23:35.840
Wow!

23:36.910 --> 23:38.380
Hey, Kim Jenna.

23:40.180 --> 23:41.850
You've changed.

23:42.580 --> 23:44.080
Were you always this shameless?

23:49.420 --> 23:50.300
Jeez.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.330
Please.

23:52.090 --> 23:53.160
Please?

23:53.890 --> 23:56.030
Please... Please...

23:56.280 --> 23:58.050
That darned "please."

23:58.630 --> 24:00.730
I said that so many times.

24:01.070 --> 24:03.840
Wow, it's already been 5 years.

24:05.010 --> 24:06.270
- Troy...
- Hey!

24:07.110 --> 24:08.150
You know,

24:08.580 --> 24:10.480
this isn't how you ask for a favor.

24:10.710 --> 24:13.310
I went down on my knees and begged you.

24:13.750 --> 24:14.820
What will you do?

24:15.120 --> 24:17.150
Huh? Crawl?

24:17.450 --> 24:19.550
Or stand in that corner?

24:20.090 --> 24:22.860
Or serve me as your master forever?

24:23.360 --> 24:25.230
Or go rob a bank?

24:27.630 --> 24:29.760
Nothing is coming to mind right now.

24:31.370 --> 24:32.770
What if it's Bbiyong?

24:33.300 --> 24:34.300
How's that?

24:36.840 --> 24:37.470
What?

24:37.500 --> 24:38.980
The one who instigated it...

24:39.010 --> 24:40.010
It was Bbiyong.

24:40.010 --> 24:42.710
He said it was between referencing and plagiarism.

24:42.710 --> 24:44.680
He sent you all the songs you used as samples.

24:44.680 --> 24:46.250
What a load of crap!

24:47.550 --> 24:48.620
I never plagiarized.

24:48.620 --> 24:50.750
Bbiyong made you believe that.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.450
Then he took your place after you left.

24:53.450 --> 24:54.460
You.

24:55.460 --> 24:57.320
Shut your mouth and get out.

25:03.300 --> 25:05.900
We all knew that but ignored it.

25:07.130 --> 25:09.600
I admit that.

25:10.970 --> 25:12.110
We were scared

25:13.410 --> 25:15.140
we'd lose what was ours.

25:15.610 --> 25:17.380
We only thought about debuting.

25:18.510 --> 25:20.950
We wanted to remove everything that hindered it.

25:21.650 --> 25:23.950
Our debut got pushed back so many times.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.850
We were on edge every single day.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.720
What a good excuse.

25:31.590 --> 25:33.960
I know. We still shouldn't have done that.

25:33.960 --> 25:34.800
Stop it!

25:36.330 --> 25:38.370
When you asked for one more chance,

25:38.370 --> 25:40.330
we should've been on your side.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.070
I'm sorry.

25:44.440 --> 25:47.480
Jenna... I'm telling you...

25:47.480 --> 25:49.880
I really didn't mean to plagiarize.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.950
I'll write another song. Huh?

25:52.210 --> 25:53.480
Jenna...

25:53.910 --> 25:58.050
Please ask the CEO to give me another chance.

25:58.050 --> 25:59.190
Please...

26:00.190 --> 26:01.320
Stop it.

26:02.290 --> 26:03.790
It's over.

26:03.790 --> 26:06.060
Please... Just one more chance... Huh?

26:06.190 --> 26:07.730
Just one more chance!

26:07.730 --> 26:09.630
Jenna! Jenna!

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
I regret it.

26:17.540 --> 26:18.540
I'm sorry.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.550
I acted like I was cold.

26:23.110 --> 26:26.150
I ignored that you were my friend.

26:27.550 --> 26:29.520
I'm sorry I didn't stand in the rain with you.

26:31.390 --> 26:36.920
We were all young, scared and immature then.

26:43.130 --> 26:46.070
Okay. Let's say you're right.

26:47.300 --> 26:48.940
But why is Bbiyong compensation?

26:50.300 --> 26:52.270
I know you held on all this time with vengeance.

26:52.470 --> 26:54.940
You waited for this and worked hard to succeed.

26:54.940 --> 26:56.180
But Bbiyong?

26:56.980 --> 26:58.980
Bbiyong is still higher up than you.

26:59.580 --> 27:01.250
No. That's ridiculous.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.120
That's what Bbiyong thinks.

27:04.950 --> 27:05.890
So?

27:07.120 --> 27:09.190
You want me to take you guys on

27:09.790 --> 27:11.430
and show him what I've got?

27:12.060 --> 27:12.930
Hmm?

27:25.220 --> 27:27.510
Look. Huh?

27:27.510 --> 27:28.910
This is me!

27:28.910 --> 27:30.340
This is proof enough!

27:30.340 --> 27:32.410
Why would I waste my time on you?

27:32.550 --> 27:34.230
We have a video channel.

27:34.480 --> 27:35.820
If you watch what we uploaded today,

27:35.820 --> 27:37.550
you'll see what I mean.

27:39.490 --> 27:40.620
I'll be waiting.

27:46.390 --> 27:47.690
And thank you.

27:48.230 --> 27:49.500
For making time for me.

27:54.230 --> 27:55.770
Dream on.

28:03.980 --> 28:06.510
Did A really say that?

28:06.880 --> 28:07.880
Yeah.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.380
He said the reason we can't make it

28:10.380 --> 28:12.190
is because of our zombie-like pride.

28:12.820 --> 28:15.160
He said we gave up his premium,

28:15.160 --> 28:17.690
so no one will work with us.

28:18.360 --> 28:19.360
And?

28:20.090 --> 28:22.730
Becoming No.1 in a music show and disbanding

28:22.730 --> 28:24.330
is so childish.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.840
He said CEO Ma will weep in his grave.

28:29.570 --> 28:31.670
Why did he bring up CEO Ma?

28:31.940 --> 28:33.610
He's so mean.

28:34.470 --> 28:38.950
He also said we shouldn't hit a rock with eggs.

28:38.950 --> 28:41.080
But make fried eggs.

28:42.350 --> 28:46.350
We asked why he pretended to help us

28:46.350 --> 28:48.620
when he intended on the exact opposite.

28:49.320 --> 28:50.660
What did he say?

28:51.930 --> 28:55.930
He was going to drag it out, then end us.

28:56.260 --> 28:59.370
I guess he really hates us.

29:01.270 --> 29:04.000
Did we do something wrong to A?

29:04.170 --> 29:05.740
Why is he going so far?

29:12.380 --> 29:15.750
Still... You'll look for another producer, right?

29:17.920 --> 29:19.150
Of course!

29:19.750 --> 29:21.820
If we were going to cave now,

29:22.260 --> 29:23.690
we wouldn't have even started this.

29:30.660 --> 29:32.030
They're driving me nuts.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.600
Look at Hyun-ji acting all innocent.

29:36.870 --> 29:37.970
Who could A be?

29:37.970 --> 29:40.270
They concealed his identity skillfully.

29:40.270 --> 29:43.180
They dodged everything that might cause a problem.

29:43.180 --> 29:45.550
All the while, conveying everything they want.

29:45.550 --> 29:47.310
Were they always this clever?

29:47.310 --> 29:50.080
I don't know if they're clever or manipulative.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.750
If they didn't specify who it was,

29:52.750 --> 29:54.450
maybe it won't be a problem.

29:54.450 --> 29:55.450
No.

29:55.590 --> 29:57.320
That is the problem!

29:57.320 --> 29:59.430
If it's not specified, then everyone goes on

29:59.430 --> 30:00.960
the list of suspects.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.400
You all watched, right?

30:02.400 --> 30:04.460
Do you want to know who A is or not?

30:04.460 --> 30:05.830
- We do!
- See?

30:05.830 --> 30:07.570
You're curious! Everyone is curious!

30:07.570 --> 30:08.600
Even I'm curious!

30:08.600 --> 30:10.140
Huh? What's this?

30:10.140 --> 30:10.900
What, what, what?

30:10.900 --> 30:12.510
There's a new comment.

30:12.510 --> 30:14.540
It says A is Bbiyong.

30:14.540 --> 30:17.610
Bbiyong? What are you talking about?

30:18.250 --> 30:19.550
Show me. Where?

30:19.550 --> 30:21.150
Here, here.

30:23.250 --> 30:24.990
What do we do?

30:24.080 --> 30:26.480
Seems like A is Starpeace's Bbiyong

30:25.350 --> 30:26.690
Who wrote this?

30:26.690 --> 30:29.120
Five, six, seven, eight!

30:29.120 --> 30:30.360
Shine!

30:33.390 --> 30:36.560
Shine radiantly.

30:36.560 --> 30:37.530
This is good.

30:37.530 --> 30:41.740
How about we keep the right hand on the right eye?

30:41.870 --> 30:42.500
Like this?

30:42.500 --> 30:44.970
Yes. Lower it as we wink with our left eye.

30:44.970 --> 30:45.810
Oh, okay.

30:45.810 --> 30:47.410
We're all doing the wink, right?

30:47.410 --> 30:48.680
The wink is...

30:58.320 --> 30:59.850
Don't you feel apologetic toward Jenna?

30:59.850 --> 31:01.660
- Kim Jenna.
- Don't apologize.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.020
If you do, then I'll still owe you.

31:04.690 --> 31:06.790
Let's just

31:07.360 --> 31:08.820
wipe the slate clean.

31:10.260 --> 31:12.630
Why am I thinking about this?

31:13.000 --> 31:13.830
Jeez.

31:13.830 --> 31:16.040
How can you throw your dad's memento like that?

31:16.470 --> 31:17.800
Don't you know how to knock?

31:17.800 --> 31:19.070
I knocked three times.

31:19.270 --> 31:21.380
You didn't answer, so I thought you were dead.

31:22.340 --> 31:23.410
Why are you here?

31:23.910 --> 31:25.710
You know our charity event?

31:27.650 --> 31:29.550
Let's collab with Cotton Candy.

31:30.750 --> 31:31.690
What?

31:33.490 --> 31:34.860
No. Get out.

31:34.860 --> 31:36.060
Get out!

31:41.060 --> 31:42.830
What did you just say?

31:43.760 --> 31:46.430
As long as A in the video is Executive Bong...

31:46.430 --> 31:47.730
Come on, Sir.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.870
We don't know it's him.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.800
It was just one comment!

31:52.940 --> 31:55.340
And I'm 100% sure it was Hyun-ji.

31:55.340 --> 31:56.940
There's talk on social media.

31:56.940 --> 31:58.610
Be quiet.

31:58.610 --> 32:01.220
We must shut down what might cause trouble later.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.950
Sir...

32:03.180 --> 32:06.190
I'm telling you this will cause no problems.

32:06.590 --> 32:08.290
If you're so cautious,

32:08.290 --> 32:11.020
why did you start the fight with the girls?

32:11.290 --> 32:12.460
Why start?

32:17.100 --> 32:19.330
A few comments are no risk factor.

32:19.570 --> 32:21.500
It'll be weirder responding to that.

32:21.500 --> 32:24.000
They didn't mention the agency in the video,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.170
but you can't separate Bbiyong from the agency.

32:26.740 --> 32:27.970
If the agency is incriminated,

32:27.970 --> 32:29.480
and people say you're on a power trip,

32:30.180 --> 32:30.910
it'll cause a headache.

32:30.910 --> 32:32.310
That's their plan.

32:32.310 --> 32:33.780
You think I'll get dragged into it?

32:33.780 --> 32:35.150
There's a saying.

32:35.150 --> 32:37.750
A stitch in time saves nine.

32:38.120 --> 32:39.520
Put them in the show.

32:39.620 --> 32:42.390
It'll be good to get the message across

32:42.390 --> 32:43.660
that the agency is rooting for them.

32:43.660 --> 32:45.490
This isn't a risky situation.

32:45.490 --> 32:47.160
If the CEO says it is,

32:47.690 --> 32:48.900
then it is.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.130
And why would I do that?

32:52.700 --> 32:53.830
Lune's album.

32:56.140 --> 32:57.660
I'll feature in it.

32:59.040 --> 32:59.940
Get out.

33:00.170 --> 33:01.840
I can see where you're going with this.

33:04.380 --> 33:06.110
I'll also help you cut it off

33:06.110 --> 33:07.490
with that woman.

33:12.290 --> 33:13.290
What woman?

33:13.690 --> 33:15.560
Don't act like you don't know.

33:17.120 --> 33:20.390
There's only one woman for you.

33:22.800 --> 33:23.900
Come here.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.070
To be honest,

33:26.430 --> 33:28.100
I've never seen such a pretty woman.

33:28.300 --> 33:29.870
I understand how you must feel.

33:45.020 --> 33:46.090
What are you doing here?

33:47.720 --> 33:48.720
Stella.

33:51.220 --> 33:54.460
Oh, you're coming home now?

33:54.460 --> 33:55.900
Why are you here?

33:58.370 --> 33:59.700
No reason.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.440
Did something happen at the shoot?

34:03.240 --> 34:04.240
No.

34:05.010 --> 34:05.970
What happened with Troy?

34:06.540 --> 34:07.980
He said no, right?

34:09.480 --> 34:10.940
He's still angry?

34:13.850 --> 34:15.679
He didn't throw a water bucket over me,

34:16.650 --> 34:18.889
but his personality and vibe changed a lot.

34:20.719 --> 34:22.920
But it was good seeing him so confident.

34:26.260 --> 34:27.659
I cast the rod.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.199
Let's wait.

34:31.300 --> 34:32.300
Let's go.

34:48.050 --> 34:49.050
What?

34:50.480 --> 34:51.790
Did something happen?

34:52.989 --> 34:54.389
The agency said they want

34:54.790 --> 34:57.590
us to collab with Mars in the charity event.

34:57.990 --> 34:58.530
What?

34:58.530 --> 35:00.130
It's so weird, right?

35:00.130 --> 35:01.330
They were trying to sabotage us.

35:01.330 --> 35:03.960
What's more, it's a collab with Mars.

35:04.230 --> 35:05.870
Is it because they feel sorry?

35:07.470 --> 35:08.500
Sorry?

35:10.270 --> 35:11.670
Let's not fall for it again.

35:11.670 --> 35:12.910
If we do,

35:12.910 --> 35:15.240
we'll stick our noses in water and die!

35:15.980 --> 35:17.540
That water would go to waste.

35:17.540 --> 35:19.850
Let's just hold our breaths and die!

35:19.850 --> 35:20.850
Yeah!

35:23.650 --> 35:26.320
What nonsense is that?

35:26.320 --> 35:27.520
It's risk management.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.490
Didn't Director Yoon tell you?

35:30.220 --> 35:31.960
If we neglect it, not only you,

35:31.960 --> 35:33.460
but the agency will be swept up in gossip.

35:33.460 --> 35:35.000
They're nothing!

35:35.430 --> 35:37.930
They can't even start a rumor.

35:37.930 --> 35:40.270
They're not even recyclable trash.

35:40.630 --> 35:42.370
Who's interested?

35:43.040 --> 35:44.140
Executive Bong.

35:45.570 --> 35:47.170
Watch what you say.

35:47.970 --> 35:51.380
Some words degrade even the listener.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.980
Your expression was a bit extreme.

35:53.980 --> 35:55.680
Must you liken them to trash?

36:03.820 --> 36:04.820
Are you

36:05.500 --> 36:06.960
trying to screw me over?

36:07.430 --> 36:09.000
Because of what happened last time?

36:10.100 --> 36:12.960
You mad because you think I was out of line?

36:15.100 --> 36:17.670
I thought you okayed it.

36:18.670 --> 36:20.670
Last time? What happened?

36:23.140 --> 36:24.950
There's something else I don't know?

36:26.450 --> 36:27.480
Sir.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.490
Leave us.

36:52.910 --> 36:54.840
Why didn't you stop him?

36:54.840 --> 36:56.520
A collab is nonsense!

36:56.740 --> 36:59.150
Of course I tried to stop him!

36:59.150 --> 37:01.050
But don't you think you're overreacting?

37:01.050 --> 37:02.780
Why are you so mad?

37:03.250 --> 37:04.980
It's good you're for the agency,

37:04.980 --> 37:06.990
but aren't you a member of their debut album?

37:07.220 --> 37:09.290
Shouldn't you feel differently?

37:11.560 --> 37:12.660
Darn it!

37:19.360 --> 37:21.770
You can talk about the details with Director Yoon.

37:27.370 --> 37:29.180
Should we be thankful?

37:29.180 --> 37:30.860
Or should we be wary?

37:35.320 --> 37:37.280
Why didn't you mention the agency in your video?

37:37.880 --> 37:39.490
You would've gained more supporters.

37:39.490 --> 37:41.650
We would've crossed the line with the agency.

37:41.650 --> 37:43.660
You still have expectations toward the agency?

37:45.330 --> 37:46.730
You don't know

37:47.030 --> 37:49.200
what Starpeace means to us.

37:49.530 --> 37:51.500
You'll never know no matter how much I explain.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.270
I get that now.

37:55.030 --> 37:56.570
You didn't answer my question.

37:57.570 --> 37:59.040
Is this a trick?

37:59.140 --> 38:01.940
If I plan a scheme, it'd be more elaborate.

38:02.380 --> 38:04.410
Sadly, I didn't plan this.

38:05.210 --> 38:06.850
Now that that's cleared up,

38:06.850 --> 38:08.250
do your best.

38:08.250 --> 38:10.480
For those who stuck out their necks for you.

38:10.750 --> 38:13.850
Oh, I'm not one of them.

38:21.530 --> 38:24.330
Wow, you're crafty.

38:28.200 --> 38:29.200
Hey!

38:29.570 --> 38:30.870
Hey!

38:35.710 --> 38:36.710
Yes?

38:40.250 --> 38:41.780
What's going on between you and CEO Cha?

38:41.780 --> 38:42.280
What?

38:42.280 --> 38:45.290
If it's nothing, why is CEO Cha doing this?

38:45.890 --> 38:46.890
Bbiyong.

38:48.150 --> 38:50.160
That's enough, okay?

38:50.160 --> 38:52.130
Taking up your time and bothering you...

38:52.590 --> 38:53.690
I'm sorry about that.

38:54.530 --> 38:56.560
I understand you were stressed out.

38:56.560 --> 38:57.530
I'm sorry.

39:00.100 --> 39:01.530
You tart!

39:04.490 --> 39:05.400
Hey.

39:05.980 --> 39:08.410
You're playing me, aren't you?

39:08.410 --> 39:09.180
No.

39:10.040 --> 39:12.480
I'm really mad at you.

39:13.080 --> 39:16.090
But we have no time or energy to deal with you.

39:16.420 --> 39:19.320
We have bigger and tougher mountains to climb.

39:19.320 --> 39:21.250
"Just come at us. We'll crush you."

39:21.250 --> 39:22.720
They're all like that.

39:23.090 --> 39:25.460
I'm curious about why you're really doing this.

39:25.860 --> 39:27.090
But I'll let it go.

39:28.230 --> 39:29.750
You forget us, too.

39:35.370 --> 39:36.570
Darn it!

39:37.770 --> 39:39.840
- We're really doing a collab?
- We're really doing a collab?

39:40.810 --> 39:41.570
Yes.

39:42.850 --> 39:44.080
You don't have to worry.

39:45.110 --> 39:46.980
I can't believe it.

39:47.980 --> 39:49.720
You're sure this isn't another trick?

39:50.420 --> 39:51.280
Yes, I'm sure.

39:51.790 --> 39:54.890
Seriously! This is so annoying! That Bong bastard!

39:54.890 --> 39:56.660
What did he do to us?

39:56.660 --> 39:58.930
When will we ever get to have a big laugh?

39:58.930 --> 40:00.560
Instead, we're worried it's another trick.

40:00.560 --> 40:01.560
Come on.

40:01.910 --> 40:03.590
Let's just enjoy it for once.

40:12.440 --> 40:13.760
Wow!

40:14.020 --> 40:15.740
This is all thanks to that comment!

40:16.140 --> 40:18.810
You did so well, Chae-ah! Good job!

40:21.720 --> 40:22.980
Wasn't it you?

40:22.980 --> 40:23.580
Huh?

40:24.080 --> 40:25.380
Wasn't it you?

40:26.150 --> 40:27.420
It wasn't me.

40:33.890 --> 40:34.960
It wasn't me.

40:35.500 --> 40:36.780
Then who was it?

40:38.130 --> 40:39.130
Ae-rin?

40:39.300 --> 40:41.100
But make fried eggs.

40:41.470 --> 40:43.970
We asked why he pretended to help

40:43.970 --> 40:45.710
when he intended on the exact opposite.

40:45.710 --> 40:46.670
What did he say?

40:46.670 --> 40:50.140
He was going to drag it out, then end us.

40:51.080 --> 40:54.050
I guess he really hates us.

40:54.050 --> 40:56.820
Did we do something wrong to A?

40:56.920 --> 40:58.520
Why is he going so far?

40:59.050 --> 41:02.360
Still... You'll look for another producer, right?

41:02.360 --> 41:03.390
Of course!

41:04.090 --> 41:05.960
If we were going to cave now,

41:06.540 --> 41:08.360
we wouldn't have even started this.

41:10.430 --> 41:12.770
There are a total of 3 performances.

41:12.770 --> 41:14.630
One is a collab with Mars.

41:14.630 --> 41:15.940
Two are our songs.

41:16.370 --> 41:18.400
We'll do "White Day" and "Honest."

41:19.070 --> 41:19.940
Since Elle is out,

41:19.940 --> 41:21.640
we'll change the choreography and composition.

41:23.010 --> 41:24.940
The show isn't open to public, but there will be news.

41:24.940 --> 41:26.310
So it'll attract attention.

41:26.850 --> 41:28.410
Mars has never done

41:28.410 --> 41:30.420
a performance like this.

41:31.620 --> 41:32.740
Let's do well.

41:33.320 --> 41:34.620
This is another opportunity.

41:36.860 --> 41:41.160
Under the twinkling star, the compass was dark

41:41.330 --> 41:43.830
What do you feel?

41:44.890 --> 41:47.170
If I'm honest

41:47.170 --> 41:49.700
Tell me if you're thinking the same thing

41:54.570 --> 41:55.910
I'm exhausted.

41:56.310 --> 41:57.910
I'll ask for another time slot.

41:57.910 --> 41:59.780
I know what dance I want to do with you.

42:01.950 --> 42:03.780
Yeah, I'm sure you'll get it.

42:05.690 --> 42:09.390
Director Yoon bought stocks behind his wife's back

42:09.390 --> 42:11.490
3 years ago, and lost everything.

42:11.730 --> 42:13.830
I think it was about KRW 30 million.

42:14.630 --> 42:18.260
Of all people, he got caught by me!

42:18.730 --> 42:21.730
If his wife finds out, he's so dead.

42:24.340 --> 42:25.540
What do you want to do with Chae-ah?

42:25.540 --> 42:28.540
You know the intro performance in Mars's show?

42:28.540 --> 42:30.210
What Ji-han and Ellie did?

42:30.210 --> 42:30.740
What?

42:30.740 --> 42:31.740
What?

42:31.950 --> 42:35.080
Find the video and play it as background music.

42:35.080 --> 42:36.120
Okay!

42:36.120 --> 42:38.280
Okay, first...

42:38.660 --> 42:40.420
Let's brighten up the face.

42:41.150 --> 42:42.160
Here we go.

42:50.260 --> 42:50.860
Okay!

42:50.860 --> 42:51.900
You, too!

42:54.700 --> 42:55.670
- Okay!
- Okay!

42:55.670 --> 42:56.870
Perfect!

43:06.680 --> 43:07.880
That's too much.

43:10.020 --> 43:10.520
Hey!

43:10.520 --> 43:12.250
It's not that kind of vibe!

43:13.390 --> 43:15.320
It should be.

43:18.390 --> 43:21.090
Whoa! Chae-ah!

43:29.370 --> 43:31.270
It's supposed to be like this.

43:35.380 --> 43:36.900
- Hello.
- Hello.

43:41.410 --> 43:43.350
So? What?

43:43.350 --> 43:44.620
Up for a dance battle?

43:44.620 --> 43:46.220
- So suddenly?
- A battle?

43:46.220 --> 43:47.850
Let's show them, Dan!

43:47.850 --> 43:48.860
Let's do this!

43:49.020 --> 43:50.690
Okay, clear up the space, everyone!

43:50.690 --> 43:52.130
- Okay!
- Okay!

43:56.500 --> 43:58.560
Cotton Candy!

43:58.750 --> 44:01.580
Mars! Mars! Mars!

44:01.580 --> 44:02.580
Dan! Awesome!

44:04.540 --> 44:08.550
- Mars! Mars! Mars!
- Cotton Candy! Cotton Candy!

44:10.530 --> 44:12.080
Fight on!

44:26.150 --> 44:28.070
You're so cool! You can have me!

44:35.160 --> 44:39.930
Mars! Mars! Mars!

44:39.930 --> 44:41.370
Cotton Candy! Cotton Candy!

44:41.370 --> 44:47.550
- Mars! Mars! Mars!
- Cotton Candy! Cotton Candy!

44:54.120 --> 44:55.190
Bravo!

44:55.670 --> 44:57.160
Good job, Cotton Candy!

45:01.720 --> 45:02.600
Awesome!

45:06.390 --> 45:09.240
Mars! Mars! Mars!

45:15.940 --> 45:17.880
You know what it feels like?

45:17.880 --> 45:18.950
What?

45:19.380 --> 45:23.380
Like my naïve son is dating a delinquent girl.

45:23.380 --> 45:25.380
A dangerous and risky feeling.

45:33.460 --> 45:35.500
Thanks for letting us do the collab.

45:36.330 --> 45:39.030
We'll do our best to do a great performance.

45:44.500 --> 45:46.310
About Bbiyong...

45:48.240 --> 45:50.180
The agency had no idea.

45:54.550 --> 45:55.320
Thank you.

45:55.320 --> 45:56.520
For telling me.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.060
Hello.

46:04.920 --> 46:06.090
The meeting is starting.

46:10.530 --> 46:12.670
I'm doing it because the agency told me to.

46:12.670 --> 46:14.370
But I haven't accepted it completely.

46:14.370 --> 46:16.370
There's nothing not to accept.

46:16.940 --> 46:18.440
Is this your doing?

46:18.440 --> 46:19.870
No, I just made a suggestion.

46:21.040 --> 46:22.040
Ji-han!

46:22.040 --> 46:24.510
Come on, Boss. You can do it!

46:24.510 --> 46:25.950
Why am I your boss?

46:25.950 --> 46:27.610
When you act like you're the boss.

46:28.050 --> 46:30.350
I consider every job equally important.

46:30.350 --> 46:32.490
If we're doing this, it has to be done perfectly.

46:32.490 --> 46:33.490
Got that?

46:33.750 --> 46:34.820
Of course.

46:35.320 --> 46:37.520
I also know you hate variables.

46:39.730 --> 46:41.290
Let's do this well.

46:41.690 --> 46:42.730
Okay.

46:45.200 --> 46:47.570
Well, I think white is good.

46:47.570 --> 46:49.250
But white itself is so...

47:02.880 --> 47:04.680
Me! Me, too! Me, too!

47:04.680 --> 47:05.890
- I have something to say!
- No!

47:05.890 --> 47:07.990
Don't come here. Just stay there.

47:07.990 --> 47:09.360
- What?
- One time slot! Just one more!

47:09.360 --> 47:10.420
The meeting is over, right?

47:17.830 --> 47:19.870
This is what working feels like.

47:20.770 --> 47:22.600
I felt like such a bum until now.

47:23.700 --> 47:25.300
Troy hasn't called back, right?

47:26.610 --> 47:27.740
He will.

47:28.910 --> 47:31.040
The Troy we know is still in there.

47:31.880 --> 47:34.580
It would've been great if Elle were here.

47:35.950 --> 47:38.720
Why couldn't we get this chance a little sooner?

47:41.810 --> 47:45.160
Unbelievable. No one can beat Hyun-ji.

47:47.090 --> 47:49.400
How did Hyun-ji know about Director Yoon

47:49.400 --> 47:51.800
investing in stocks behind his wife's back?

47:51.800 --> 47:52.630
They're fighting?

47:52.630 --> 47:56.370
Yeah. They're fighting and shouting threats.

47:58.840 --> 48:00.940
Jenna. Wait.

48:06.680 --> 48:07.910
Do you

48:07.910 --> 48:10.120
know how Elle is doing these days?

48:12.950 --> 48:13.950
No.

48:14.190 --> 48:15.650
Well...

48:16.560 --> 48:18.560
I saw something by chance...

48:22.030 --> 48:25.200
He's a rising star in high-class society.

48:25.700 --> 48:28.330
His bio company became enormously successful.

48:29.170 --> 48:31.370
He wants to invest in the entertainment business.

48:31.970 --> 48:34.040
People say he'll start an agency.

48:35.370 --> 48:37.780
They say he's gentle, but you never know.

48:39.650 --> 48:41.580
It might be a hasty assumption,

48:42.480 --> 48:43.750
but I'm worried...

49:01.630 --> 49:03.240
Yesterday and today

49:03.240 --> 49:06.770
The days are too short

49:07.570 --> 49:09.180
Will tomorrow be different?

49:09.180 --> 49:12.910
Will the day I long for come?

49:13.680 --> 49:16.250
Shadows are drawn

49:16.250 --> 49:19.820
So I can't see the sky

49:20.090 --> 49:24.890
Will the day come when I blossom?

49:25.590 --> 49:27.730
The dream that was my everything

49:27.960 --> 49:31.760
I remember that thrill

49:31.760 --> 49:33.930
Don't let it hide you

49:33.930 --> 49:37.840
I leave my confined self behind

49:37.840 --> 49:40.010
Dark night blues

49:40.010 --> 49:44.110
Riding out the storm, I bloom

49:44.110 --> 49:49.350
When my time comes again

49:52.150 --> 49:54.050
Elle

50:00.290 --> 50:01.690
You have to stretch it far.

50:01.690 --> 50:04.030
When the darkness falls

50:04.030 --> 50:07.600
Even if I'm all alone at night

50:07.600 --> 50:09.340
It'll be okay

50:09.340 --> 50:10.840
What's wrong?

50:10.840 --> 50:13.110
Why? Did something happen?

50:13.110 --> 50:13.670
No.

50:13.670 --> 50:16.340
It'll be dazzling

50:16.340 --> 50:18.110
Shine on my days

50:18.110 --> 50:19.950
Radiantly

50:19.950 --> 50:24.980
When the season I've been waiting for comes

50:31.720 --> 50:32.890
Want me to cut that for you?

50:33.490 --> 50:35.730
Oh... No, thank you.

50:38.360 --> 50:40.040
Do you like that dress?

50:40.900 --> 50:41.900
Yes.

50:44.200 --> 50:45.880
Why are you so tense?

50:46.270 --> 50:48.170
It's like you reset every time we meet.

50:48.340 --> 50:51.440
Is our conversation boring?

50:51.710 --> 50:52.810
Oh, no.

50:52.810 --> 50:53.950
Is it fun?

50:59.080 --> 51:00.550
You can't lie.

51:02.250 --> 51:03.690
Bon appetit.

51:05.120 --> 51:06.630
It's expensive.

51:16.140 --> 51:17.540
Let's not rush things.

51:18.100 --> 51:21.570
Elle, I mean, Kang Yu-ri...

51:21.770 --> 51:24.210
I must see what kind of person you are.

51:26.180 --> 51:28.080
You have to be careful in business.

51:28.550 --> 51:30.380
I know one thing for sure.

51:31.780 --> 51:34.820
Kang Yu-ri, you shine more

51:35.120 --> 51:36.290
as a solo.

51:37.320 --> 51:38.190
What do you think

51:38.460 --> 51:40.160
about debuting as a solo artist?

51:41.430 --> 51:42.360
Oh...

51:44.020 --> 51:46.270
I also think that a solo...

51:47.730 --> 51:48.730
Kim Jenna

52:19.500 --> 52:20.570
Hi.

52:22.030 --> 52:23.030
What is it?

52:26.540 --> 52:27.900
You've been well?

52:28.610 --> 52:29.610
Yeah.

52:31.540 --> 52:33.280
Where are you staying?

52:33.610 --> 52:34.710
A study room.

52:37.850 --> 52:39.650
Don't look at me like that.

52:40.890 --> 52:42.330
People live there.

52:42.620 --> 52:44.320
I'm not staying there forever.

52:51.660 --> 52:52.630
What about work?

52:53.900 --> 52:55.030
Kim Jenna!

52:55.700 --> 52:57.340
What do you want to say?

52:58.540 --> 53:00.870
Don't beat around the bush. Just say it.

53:02.070 --> 53:03.640
What do you want to know?

53:08.680 --> 53:10.250
Did you meet Asst. Manager Park?

53:13.990 --> 53:15.520
Whatever he said, it's probably true.

53:16.090 --> 53:17.790
But it's none of your business.

53:19.290 --> 53:20.390
Elle!

53:26.400 --> 53:28.070
Do you know how much this costs?

53:33.770 --> 53:35.320
You go your way.

53:36.050 --> 53:38.110
I'll go mine to survive.

53:39.780 --> 53:41.750
Isn't surviving what's important?

53:44.280 --> 53:45.850
Don't ever call me again.

53:46.590 --> 53:47.920
Come back.

53:48.620 --> 53:49.690
We need you.

53:49.690 --> 53:50.860
I don't.

53:51.860 --> 53:53.460
Kang Yu-ri!

53:54.930 --> 53:56.730
Don't call me by that name.

54:08.270 --> 54:10.140
Not that way.

54:10.140 --> 54:11.840
The important thing is

54:12.610 --> 54:14.650
not just surviving!

54:14.650 --> 54:17.520
It's how you survive!

54:19.350 --> 54:21.050
Who gave you the right to set that?

54:23.520 --> 54:24.920
Who do you think you are?

54:25.890 --> 54:29.060
Why are you dictating my life? How dare you!

54:34.470 --> 54:36.540
You disgust me.

54:40.770 --> 54:42.980
You really disgust me!

54:47.210 --> 54:50.580
I don't ever want to see you again.

54:51.950 --> 54:53.220
Don't...

54:55.450 --> 54:57.460
Don't ever show up in front of me again.

56:18.200 --> 56:20.340
What is she doing there?

56:35.120 --> 56:36.400
Good day, Ma'am.

56:36.620 --> 56:38.560
I'd like to make your acquaintance.

56:38.560 --> 56:39.830
I am...

56:47.630 --> 56:49.700
Seriously, why is she there?

56:51.770 --> 56:53.570
She's so bothersome.

57:11.220 --> 57:12.960
It's so late.

57:21.900 --> 57:23.740
I can't believe she's making me do this.

57:32.780 --> 57:34.610
Members: 26
Visitors: 1

57:39.080 --> 57:41.550
Our Candies still haven't all come forward.

57:43.590 --> 57:45.290
You don't know where they all went?

57:45.820 --> 57:47.030
Why don't you know?

57:48.760 --> 57:50.260
By the way,

57:51.450 --> 57:53.340
among the 26 Candies,

57:53.370 --> 57:55.300
who do you remember the most?

57:56.000 --> 57:57.240
Well...

57:57.440 --> 57:59.950
First, Mrs. Homma (Homepage Master).

58:01.510 --> 58:03.680
She said she had four sons.

58:03.680 --> 58:05.210
She was sick of those bastards...

58:08.510 --> 58:10.350
She was sick of those kids.

58:10.350 --> 58:12.580
She was so good to us.

58:13.750 --> 58:16.560
We called her Mama instead of Homma.

58:28.870 --> 58:30.070
What is it?

58:30.340 --> 58:32.200
I think I'm going to cry.

58:34.270 --> 58:35.910
Then why did you stop filming?

58:35.910 --> 58:37.510
Huh? Look!

58:37.510 --> 58:38.740
Can you do it even now?

58:38.740 --> 58:39.740
Let me see.

58:40.450 --> 58:41.610
Look at the camera!

58:41.610 --> 58:43.750
Let a tear drop fall from one eye!

58:44.850 --> 58:46.220
This is better.

58:46.990 --> 58:50.120
It looks misty and sad.

58:50.520 --> 58:52.060
Should I turn on the camera?

58:52.060 --> 58:52.590
What should I do?

58:52.590 --> 58:54.290
Come on!

58:54.290 --> 58:56.400
Jeez.

58:57.330 --> 59:00.070
Why did the show have to be undisclosed?

59:00.070 --> 59:02.500
If it was open to the public, it'll be an issue.

59:02.500 --> 59:04.940
Then our Candies will come!

59:11.510 --> 59:13.250
We can create an issue!

59:13.710 --> 59:14.550
Huh?

59:15.680 --> 59:18.350
First, let's give up on our duet dance.

59:19.380 --> 59:20.690
Why?

59:21.090 --> 59:23.120
We got Director Yoon's approval!

59:35.100 --> 59:35.970
Ji-han!

59:35.970 --> 59:37.640
Huh? Hi.

59:38.200 --> 59:40.040
Hello, Ji-han!

59:43.410 --> 59:46.850
I have a favor to ask.

59:48.080 --> 59:50.350
You'll do it for me, right?

59:50.980 --> 59:52.980
You know...

59:53.570 --> 59:55.590
Generosity comes from the storage.

59:57.920 --> 59:59.020
Chae-ah, Hyun-ji.

59:59.020 --> 1:00:01.930
The cue sheet has been confirmed with your duet.

1:00:01.930 --> 1:00:03.460
Prepare well.

1:00:03.930 --> 1:00:05.860
And about your dance moves.

1:00:05.860 --> 1:00:07.300
Tone it down.

1:00:07.400 --> 1:00:09.700
Why is it so heated?

1:00:10.570 --> 1:00:12.040
It's not natural.

1:00:12.370 --> 1:00:13.070
Sir!

1:00:13.070 --> 1:00:14.840
Don't, Hyun-ji. Put your hand down.

1:00:14.840 --> 1:00:16.520
Don't talk. Just listen.

1:00:17.340 --> 1:00:18.410
Don't stand up.

1:00:18.410 --> 1:00:19.280
We...

1:00:19.780 --> 1:00:21.850
won't do our duet performance.

1:00:23.780 --> 1:00:26.080
Why did you change your mind? Why? Why?

1:00:26.080 --> 1:00:29.350
You just said it was unnatural.

1:00:29.350 --> 1:00:31.590
So we thought it best not to do it.

1:00:33.230 --> 1:00:35.560
Yeah? Really?

1:00:35.760 --> 1:00:37.700
Chae-ah, is this real?

1:00:37.700 --> 1:00:38.260
Yes.

1:00:38.260 --> 1:00:40.700
Okay, then. Great. Good thinking.

1:00:40.700 --> 1:00:41.730
I mean,

1:00:41.810 --> 1:00:45.100
it's so short that it's not cost-effective.

1:00:45.900 --> 1:00:47.110
Instead!

1:00:47.110 --> 1:00:49.210
I have a better card!

1:00:49.210 --> 1:00:49.980
Don't.

1:00:49.980 --> 1:00:50.910
It's none other

1:00:50.910 --> 1:00:53.910
than Jenna and Ji-han!

1:00:54.210 --> 1:00:57.650
It'll be much more natural. It'll be so good!

1:00:58.080 --> 1:00:59.790
The response will be explosive!

1:01:03.090 --> 1:01:04.420
Oh Hyun-ji!

1:01:04.860 --> 1:01:06.830
What are you doing? Sit down.

1:01:06.830 --> 1:01:08.560
What do you think, Ji-han?

1:01:10.030 --> 1:01:11.400
I think it's good.

1:01:12.930 --> 1:01:13.800
You heard him.

1:01:14.580 --> 1:01:15.770
Seriously!

1:01:15.970 --> 1:01:18.100
Sorry. Sorry.

1:01:18.240 --> 1:01:19.270
I apologize.

1:01:19.270 --> 1:01:21.270
Hyun-ji. I'm quitting.

1:01:22.770 --> 1:01:24.640
Do you have an opening at your company?

1:01:25.180 --> 1:01:27.980
Why not? You said there's going to be one?

1:01:28.350 --> 1:01:29.710
It's because...

1:01:33.350 --> 1:01:34.320
I'm so exhausted!

1:01:34.320 --> 1:01:36.390
I mean, I'm so exhausted. Yeah.

1:01:39.930 --> 1:01:41.960
It was originally a male-female duet.

1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:42.690
Right.

1:01:42.690 --> 1:01:44.300
Just because it's a charity event,

1:01:44.300 --> 1:01:47.370
we shouldn't ignore its original concept.

1:01:47.370 --> 1:01:48.700
Since we're doing this,

1:01:48.700 --> 1:01:50.570
let's do this right.

1:01:50.970 --> 1:01:52.800
Right, Ji-han?

1:01:52.800 --> 1:01:53.800
Yeah.

1:01:54.870 --> 1:01:55.870
Ji-han.

1:01:55.970 --> 1:01:57.180
I like it.

1:01:57.180 --> 1:01:58.180
Me, too.

1:01:59.410 --> 1:02:00.280
What about you, Dan?

1:02:00.280 --> 1:02:01.150
Me, too.

1:02:02.010 --> 1:02:03.050
Me, too.

1:02:07.290 --> 1:02:08.450
But still...

1:02:09.250 --> 1:02:10.460
Hold on.

1:02:14.530 --> 1:02:15.530
Hello?

1:02:15.960 --> 1:02:17.960
Imagining you and me walking together

1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:20.300
My cheeks blush as if I found happiness

1:02:20.300 --> 1:02:22.000
Even though the path we're walking on

1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:23.170
Is different for a while

1:02:23.170 --> 1:02:24.640
Let's hold hands tightly

1:02:24.970 --> 1:02:25.900
Let's meet.

1:02:49.390 --> 1:02:50.460
So

1:02:51.730 --> 1:02:53.330
that stupid bastard

1:02:53.330 --> 1:02:55.800
is certain no A-list producer will take you on

1:02:55.800 --> 1:02:57.140
except for him?

1:02:58.100 --> 1:02:58.940
Yes.

1:03:00.010 --> 1:03:03.010
He doesn't think you'll even see us.

1:03:05.640 --> 1:03:08.210
But is showing that he's wrong

1:03:08.700 --> 1:03:10.240
revenge?

1:03:10.750 --> 1:03:13.650
I don't care at all about how he feels.

1:03:14.120 --> 1:03:16.090
What you achieved until now...

1:03:16.490 --> 1:03:18.390
Bbiyong did all of it first.

1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:20.930
Those numerous awards...

1:03:21.460 --> 1:03:23.060
Bbiyong also has them.

1:03:23.060 --> 1:03:24.560
Doing what Bbiyong hasn't done.

1:03:24.560 --> 1:03:26.060
Isn't that real revenge?

1:03:26.770 --> 1:03:27.770
I don't know.

1:03:28.030 --> 1:03:29.470
It's not bad.

1:03:29.890 --> 1:03:31.300
But still...

1:03:31.740 --> 1:03:33.420
I hate you more.

1:03:34.070 --> 1:03:36.410
My wish was that you get ruined.

1:03:37.180 --> 1:03:38.380
Why would I help you?

1:03:39.140 --> 1:03:40.110
Troy...

1:03:41.750 --> 1:03:43.110
Your wish

1:03:43.850 --> 1:03:45.820
already came to pass a long time ago.

1:03:49.490 --> 1:03:50.490
Okay.

1:03:54.090 --> 1:03:55.390
I'll think about it.

1:03:55.760 --> 1:03:56.860
But

1:03:58.700 --> 1:04:00.430
there's a price you must pay.

1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:03.330
Just like how I knelt and begged.

1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:07.710
Kneel?

1:04:09.740 --> 1:04:11.310
I can kneel a hundred times.

1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:12.680
No.

1:04:12.740 --> 1:04:14.450
I don't want it from you.

1:04:19.050 --> 1:04:20.050
Then?

1:04:28.530 --> 1:04:29.390
Elle!

1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:34.230
Tell Elle to come here herself.

1:04:35.730 --> 1:04:37.000
She has to come

1:04:37.740 --> 1:04:39.440
and earnestly beg.

1:04:41.770 --> 1:04:43.710
I'll see what she does,

1:04:45.480 --> 1:04:47.160
and make a decision then.

1:05:07.330 --> 1:05:09.830
IDOL
[IDOL: The Coup]

1:05:09.970 --> 1:05:12.070
How can you ask me to plead with him?

1:05:12.070 --> 1:05:13.340
You stab people in the back and

1:05:13.340 --> 1:05:14.640
switch teams when things get rough!

1:05:14.640 --> 1:05:16.640
What do I have to do, you jerk?

1:05:16.640 --> 1:05:18.780
You shouldn't be so spiteful.

1:05:18.780 --> 1:05:19.780
You tramp.

1:05:19.780 --> 1:05:21.950
How much more understanding must I be?

1:05:21.950 --> 1:05:24.050
Including acting up to help Cotton Candy.

1:05:24.050 --> 1:05:25.980
We can't do it without you.

1:05:25.980 --> 1:05:26.850
Come back.

1:05:26.850 --> 1:05:29.120
I also felt bad leaving like that.

1:05:29.190 --> 1:05:30.190
Can you change

1:05:30.190 --> 1:05:31.890
those mean comments to compliments?

1:05:32.020 --> 1:05:32.960
No.

1:05:33.020 --> 1:05:34.760
We'll go on with the power of those mean comments.

1:05:34.760 --> 1:05:36.660
Since we have no tomorrow.
