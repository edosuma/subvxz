WEBVTT

00:00.410 --> 00:02.009
tonight on the curse of Oak Island

00:08.310 --> 00:11.450
we have hits in the cavity in the money pit

00:11.450 --> 00:12.980
doesn't get any better than that

00:12.980 --> 00:15.940
how many hits does he have three days

00:15.940 --> 00:19.240
this is a nygma

00:19.240 --> 00:23.740
the face is pointing at Oak Island

00:23.740 --> 00:25.730
have financial constraints at this point

00:25.730 --> 00:31.380
we need to make a decision today

00:31.380 --> 00:34.809
there is an island in the North Atlantic

00:34.809 --> 00:36.519
where people have been looking for an

00:36.519 --> 00:39.739
incredible treasure for more than 200

00:39.739 --> 00:43.289
years so far they have found bits of

00:43.289 --> 00:46.879
gold chain a stone slab with strange

00:46.879 --> 00:50.539
symbols carved into it even a 17th

00:50.539 --> 00:54.120
century Spanish coin to date six men

00:54.120 --> 00:56.890
have died trying to solve the mystery

00:56.890 --> 01:01.170
and according to legend one more will

01:01.170 --> 01:11.160
have to die before the treasure can be

01:11.160 --> 01:14.730
found

01:14.730 --> 01:23.320
hey Mike John just got here Etan what

01:23.320 --> 01:32.170
you felt for brothers Rick and Marty

01:32.170 --> 01:35.770
lagina every day on Oak Island is a day

01:35.770 --> 01:47.840
that could forever change their lives

01:47.840 --> 01:51.470
and so far today has proven to be no

01:51.470 --> 01:57.530
exception this is a different head once

01:57.530 --> 02:00.280
again they have brought a claim divers

02:00.280 --> 02:03.770
John Chatterton and Mike Conley along

02:03.770 --> 02:05.370
with John's diving partner

02:05.370 --> 02:08.639
Howard Ehrenberg back to the island this

02:08.639 --> 02:11.749
time to explore a mysterious cavern that

02:11.749 --> 02:15.540
lies at the bottom of borehole c1 some

02:15.540 --> 02:18.999
170 feet deep beneath the area known as

02:18.999 --> 02:22.599
the money pit how many hits

02:22.599 --> 02:23.599
does he have it sounds like three the

02:23.599 --> 02:26.340
streets three hits yeah

02:26.340 --> 02:30.530
here we go it was at this same location

02:30.530 --> 02:33.370
that Rick lagina and Island historian

02:33.370 --> 02:36.180
Charles Barkhouse first discovered

02:36.180 --> 02:38.769
evidence of a shiny gold colored object

02:38.769 --> 02:41.250
which appeared to be embedded in the

02:41.250 --> 02:44.880
walls of the cavern the Ellison sir gold

02:44.880 --> 02:48.930
color did sense that Rick Marty and the

02:48.930 --> 02:51.090
team have increased the width of the

02:51.090 --> 02:54.239
borehole to 40 inches and lined it with

02:54.239 --> 02:56.430
a series of one and a quarter inch thick

02:56.430 --> 02:59.779
steel caissons they have also attempted

02:59.779 --> 03:02.090
to excavate the bottom of the cavity by

03:02.090 --> 03:05.909
means of a three-ton immigrant tool

03:05.909 --> 03:08.430
unfortunately the debris collected did

03:08.430 --> 03:10.749
not contain evidence of the mysterious

03:10.749 --> 03:13.689
metallic object prompting Rick and Marty

03:13.689 --> 03:16.319
to invite John Chatterton and his team

03:16.319 --> 03:20.579
to make a more thorough investigation

03:20.579 --> 03:22.540
let me ask you this could you've been

03:22.540 --> 03:33.790
picking up the casing

03:33.790 --> 03:37.519
another hit could divert Mike Huntley

03:37.519 --> 03:39.999
have finally located the mysterious

03:39.999 --> 03:44.029
golden object if so could it be part of

03:44.029 --> 03:46.579
the mysterious Oak Island treasure that

03:46.579 --> 03:49.180
people have been searching for and dying

03:49.180 --> 03:51.969
for for more than two centuries the

03:51.969 --> 03:54.370
world on the edge of our seats it's

03:54.370 --> 03:55.370
exciting

03:55.370 --> 03:58.090
we have hits in the cavity in the money

03:58.090 --> 04:02.340
pit doesn't get any better than that the

04:02.340 --> 04:03.920
differentiating factor is you know it

04:03.920 --> 04:07.169
could be natural geology or it could be

04:07.169 --> 04:09.269
man that heard made us look at the

04:09.269 --> 04:12.150
matter man-made was oh man they would be

04:12.150 --> 04:14.541
great game changer you can find some

04:14.541 --> 04:16.540
real tripping down there

04:16.540 --> 04:19.510
game changer game changer absolutely

04:19.510 --> 04:21.630
yeah I mean I think at this point we got

04:21.630 --> 04:31.980
to bring up whatever said you know let

04:31.980 --> 04:33.600
me just say this how do you walk away

04:33.600 --> 04:36.380
from that you want to go back down no

04:36.380 --> 04:37.380
but I came to you know he wants

04:37.380 --> 04:42.590
oh yeah right hey Mike yeah I think it's

04:42.590 --> 04:54.380
time for you to come home
unfortunately

04:54.380 --> 04:55.380
for the team

04:55.380 --> 04:57.970
Mike Huntley has nearly exhausted his

04:57.970 --> 05:02.520
available time at the bottom of c1 in

05:02.520 --> 05:04.700
order to prevent potentially deadly

05:04.700 --> 05:07.440
decompression sickness he will now need

05:07.440 --> 05:10.030
to begin a slow and steady a sentiment

05:10.030 --> 05:27.990
to the surface there's a shiny gold

05:27.990 --> 05:29.810
thing down there if anybody's gonna find

05:29.810 --> 05:30.920
it John chattering in an hour

05:30.920 --> 05:36.540
Aaron Berger gonna find it so Bravo

05:36.540 --> 05:40.760
tango might be forthcoming all right

05:40.760 --> 05:43.430
take care

05:43.430 --> 05:47.350
faster after a period of some 60 minutes

05:47.350 --> 05:49.850
my country has made it back safely and

05:49.850 --> 05:50.920
rich Charles and the team are more eager

05:50.920 --> 05:56.640
than ever to find out firsthand what he

05:56.640 --> 05:59.740
encountered at the bottom of c1

05:59.740 --> 06:04.750
hey you don't buddy called yes sorry

06:04.750 --> 06:09.720
good so what's the situation great at

06:09.720 --> 06:12.750
the bottom about here and that would be

06:12.750 --> 06:17.310
here there's a smooth sort of law almost

06:17.310 --> 06:20.250
like a stucco wall it's kind of smooth

06:20.250 --> 06:22.190
and then I had two hard hits there it

06:22.190 --> 06:26.040
was like we in the wall in the wall and

06:26.040 --> 06:29.320
then you said two words round and curvy

06:29.320 --> 06:33.210
with that smooth and sort of wavy of the

06:33.210 --> 06:37.560
wall itself not an object no no sorry no

06:37.560 --> 06:39.520
no just the wall itself and that's why

06:39.520 --> 06:40.790
there's nothing from there for you to

06:40.790 --> 06:43.260
grab and pull off here's the thing

06:43.260 --> 06:48.560
you're freezing there are legitimate

06:48.560 --> 06:51.630
metal hits in the cavity but there in

06:51.630 --> 06:53.690
the wall we gotta take the hose out so

06:53.690 --> 06:55.670
John can get it it's the typical Oak

06:55.670 --> 06:57.300
Island rollercoaster ride first you're

06:57.300 --> 06:58.820
on a high then you're on the low then

06:58.820 --> 06:59.820
you back up

06:59.820 --> 07:02.480
I just want to find one thing that tells

07:02.480 --> 07:04.660
the story of Oak Island to the most

07:04.660 --> 07:07.850
hardened skeptic for the Oak Island team

07:07.850 --> 07:10.150
the next course of action is clear

07:10.150 --> 07:12.820
Jon chattered and will make the next

07:12.820 --> 07:15.790
dive one which should determine once and

07:15.790 --> 07:18.680
for all if some sort of manmade metallic

07:18.680 --> 07:21.780
object is really located somewhere deep

07:21.780 --> 07:24.100
below the surface of the money pit where

07:24.100 --> 07:26.940
is the focus of your search I'm working

07:26.940 --> 07:29.030
on the wall

07:29.030 --> 07:31.490
with the metal detector any of the floor

07:31.490 --> 07:33.800
any of the hammer grab boy when I get

07:33.800 --> 07:35.750
past the wall you know what every times

07:35.750 --> 07:43.940
left over I'll work that that's that's

07:43.940 --> 07:52.560
phase two of my let's go after two

07:52.560 --> 07:54.460
previous attempts to locate the

07:54.460 --> 07:56.860
mysterious gold colored object at the

07:56.860 --> 08:01.550
bottom of borehole c1 a claim dimer John

08:01.550 --> 08:04.400
Chatterton will now make a third dive

08:04.400 --> 08:07.490
more than 170 feet beneath the surface

08:07.490 --> 08:10.550
of the Oak Island money pit two things

08:10.550 --> 08:12.430
need to happen they need to confirm that

08:12.430 --> 08:15.030
these heads are real and hopefully they

08:15.030 --> 08:16.860
can set eyes on target

08:16.860 --> 08:27.530
well good John
any process we endeavor

08:27.530 --> 08:29.450
to undertake on the island the hope

08:29.450 --> 08:32.190
factors through the roof that the target

08:32.190 --> 08:36.099
whatever it is is actually there

08:36.099 --> 08:38.469
because the original or whole and Siwon

08:38.469 --> 08:41.760
was only six inches wide the laginas

08:41.760 --> 08:43.659
hired a team from irving equipment

08:43.659 --> 08:46.330
limited to widen the hole to a width of

08:46.330 --> 08:49.230
40 inches and didn't reinforce it with a

08:49.230 --> 08:52.760
series of solid steel caissons

08:52.760 --> 08:54.680
stretching all the way down to bedrock

08:54.680 --> 08:58.580
at a depth of approximately 160 feet

08:58.580 --> 09:02.370
then a massive 39 inch wide drill bit

09:02.370 --> 09:05.020
was lowered into the hole in order to

09:05.020 --> 09:07.080
make the remaining 11 feet wide enough

09:07.080 --> 09:15.400
for a human diver
yes we can actually

09:15.400 --> 09:16.400
see it now

09:16.400 --> 09:24.500
copy that on the bottom

09:24.500 --> 09:28.380
now you're trying to metal detecting the

09:28.380 --> 09:30.570
place that Mike was metal detecting last

09:30.570 --> 09:35.050
time the whole idea is to prove that the

09:35.050 --> 09:38.980
Hope factor is real that we can

09:38.980 --> 09:40.920
replicate the hit site that points a

09:40.920 --> 09:50.070
matter of retrieval what are you saying

09:50.070 --> 09:53.490
the previous dives into Siwon have

09:53.490 --> 09:56.470
stirred up the clay silt in the cavern

09:56.470 --> 09:59.310
just like John Chatterton's dive in 10x

09:59.310 --> 10:01.900
last year his visibility at the bottom

10:01.900 --> 10:06.000
of the shaft is now virtually zero looks

10:06.000 --> 10:10.450
like you're in a cloud

10:10.450 --> 10:14.680
I turn the light up does that help or

10:14.680 --> 10:15.810
hurt

10:15.810 --> 10:27.500
there's no question that it's difficult

10:27.500 --> 10:29.170
for John to have a complete and thorough

10:29.170 --> 10:39.880
understanding of or might got the hits

10:39.880 --> 10:43.190
not sure yeah not sure I'm frustrated

10:43.190 --> 10:44.680
because I'm sitting on a bench when

10:44.680 --> 10:46.610
somebody else is in active search mode

10:46.610 --> 10:48.320
if you will it's frustrating

10:48.320 --> 10:54.800
are you picking something up John with

10:54.800 --> 10:58.680
this allotted time running out John

10:58.680 --> 10:59.780
Chatterton spends the next several

10:59.780 --> 11:02.370
minutes exploring the ceiling and walls

11:02.370 --> 11:04.880
of the underwater cave with the metal

11:04.880 --> 11:07.800
detector one hand he's not found it yet

11:07.800 --> 11:09.490
on the other hand he's not covered the

11:09.490 --> 11:10.490
whole cavity

11:10.490 --> 11:14.589
Island once again be up to its old

11:14.589 --> 11:17.930
tricks tantalizing treasure hunters with

11:17.930 --> 11:21.290
promises of gold and riches only to have

11:21.290 --> 11:22.990
important clues and evidence

11:22.990 --> 11:30.010
mysteriously disappear three years ago

11:30.010 --> 11:32.351
just after finding a 17th century

11:32.351 --> 11:35.900
Spanish coin in the Oak Island swamp

11:35.900 --> 11:38.490
diver Tony Sampson detected a number of

11:38.490 --> 11:41.110
underwater metal targets only to have

11:41.110 --> 11:42.210
them vanish

11:42.210 --> 11:46.870
moments later two-thirds of the way down

11:46.870 --> 11:51.250
and I did a test on my ring yeah and it

11:51.250 --> 12:05.810
says the same sort of sound obviously go

12:05.810 --> 12:09.740
slack the diver three foot the absence

12:09.740 --> 12:12.060
of any heads on John and Chatterton's

12:12.060 --> 12:14.420
metal detector has the team deeply

12:14.420 --> 12:16.790
puzzled do you feel like the business

12:16.790 --> 12:18.930
getting any better worse or staying the

12:18.930 --> 12:20.750
same

12:20.750 --> 12:26.810
could the thick clouds of sediment

12:26.810 --> 12:29.550
kicked up from the two previous dives

12:29.550 --> 12:32.100
now be preventing John Chatterton from

12:32.100 --> 12:34.540
receiving the same signals Mike Huntley

12:34.540 --> 12:39.410
was getting less than two hours ago or

12:39.410 --> 12:41.690
could the cause be something even more

12:41.690 --> 12:48.770
bizarre is it possible there is some

12:48.770 --> 12:51.560
sort of mysterious energy at the bottom

12:51.560 --> 12:54.440
of the sea one shaft the same energy

12:54.440 --> 12:56.520
that has caused many of the electronic

12:56.520 --> 12:58.850
equipment failures that have plagued Oak

12:58.850 --> 13:00.980
Island treasure hunters for more than a

13:00.980 --> 13:03.360
century that's certainly one thing about

13:03.360 --> 13:05.440
the island electronic stuff seems to

13:05.440 --> 13:08.070
fail like crazy just seems to the answer

13:08.070 --> 13:10.040
is simple its Oak Island we see it all

13:10.040 --> 13:11.770
the time yeah but I mean are you willing

13:11.770 --> 13:14.020
to say that there's a really a curse but

13:14.020 --> 13:15.360
there's really something here that

13:15.360 --> 13:17.080
causes things that malfunction things

13:17.080 --> 13:19.271
don't work here that's us that's where I

13:19.271 --> 13:21.000
end up and things don't work here not as

13:21.000 --> 13:25.930
advertised hey just so you know we're at

13:25.930 --> 13:27.080
30 minutes

13:27.080 --> 13:29.070
John Chatterton allotted time under

13:29.070 --> 13:32.560
water has now expired he must return to

13:32.560 --> 13:35.270
the surface having found no trace of the

13:35.270 --> 13:38.180
metal targets reported earlier today by

13:38.180 --> 13:43.589
fellow diver Mike Huntley

13:43.589 --> 13:45.620
although the situation offers bitter

13:45.620 --> 13:48.580
disappointment to the Oak Island team

13:48.580 --> 13:51.279
Rick lagina refuses to be anything but

13:51.279 --> 13:54.000
optimistic it's disappointing that John

13:54.000 --> 13:56.339
is not gotten any hits from the metal

13:56.339 --> 13:57.970
detector but you don't put the cart

13:57.970 --> 13:59.910
before the horse on Oak Island I'm not

13:59.910 --> 14:02.230
gonna prejudge whether or not this dive

14:02.230 --> 14:06.300
is successful tell you what let me get

14:06.300 --> 14:09.100
warm Marty and Craig are coming in we go

14:09.100 --> 14:11.490
to the war room would sit on we talked

14:11.490 --> 14:14.120
about it not only what we've learned but

14:14.120 --> 14:17.370
where the possibilities may lead makes

14:17.370 --> 14:22.260
sense yep awesome did you get warm

14:22.260 --> 14:24.670
after a long day of both excitement and

14:24.670 --> 14:29.149
uncertainty at the Oak Island money pit

14:29.149 --> 14:31.290
nothing but good news right knowledge is

14:31.290 --> 14:34.270
good knowledge is good brothers Rick and

14:34.270 --> 14:37.709
Marty lagina along with Craig tester and

14:37.709 --> 14:40.330
Dave Blankenship have gathered in the

14:40.330 --> 14:42.779
war rooms for a final debriefing of the

14:42.779 --> 14:45.780
dive operation at borehole Siwan now

14:45.780 --> 14:48.440
that we're all on the table you know the

14:48.440 --> 14:50.600
issue at hand of course is what happened

14:50.600 --> 14:52.380
didn't see one I would like to think we

14:52.380 --> 14:54.200
got lots of answers when we looked at

14:54.200 --> 14:57.390
our objectives for this I think number

14:57.390 --> 15:00.180
one was naturally man that yes and

15:00.180 --> 15:04.900
number two was shiny gold object

15:04.900 --> 15:06.270
when you did have some visibility you

15:06.270 --> 15:08.110
think you've exploited a hundred percent

15:08.110 --> 15:09.790
with the exclusion of the clay on the

15:09.790 --> 15:13.890
bottom I would say we're probably 90% on

15:13.890 --> 15:16.640
the walls and the ceiling yeah I would

15:16.640 --> 15:18.690
agree with that it's a good number this

15:18.690 --> 15:21.720
is from above looking down this is our

15:21.720 --> 15:23.800
40 inch caisson we've got a wall that

15:23.800 --> 15:27.250
comes around here and I would say around

15:27.250 --> 15:29.029
1:00 o'clock we've got a fissure that

15:29.029 --> 15:31.320
runs back something like that when you

15:31.320 --> 15:32.662
first mentioned the fissure I thought it

15:32.662 --> 15:34.580
was only like a crack but you're saying

15:34.580 --> 15:38.660
extended the hole it's irregular but you

15:38.660 --> 15:40.740
know like I could have my arm in there

15:40.740 --> 15:43.540
from the top down for the bottom this

15:43.540 --> 15:47.550
then comes across down to about here but

15:47.550 --> 15:51.810
it's over huh and over here we've got

15:51.810 --> 15:54.640
the smooth wall the section where Mike

15:54.640 --> 15:58.339
had the possible hits and then over here

15:58.339 --> 16:00.130
we're up high

16:00.130 --> 16:03.250
we've got an opening that runs back here

16:03.250 --> 16:06.161
but it's kind of like that and that it's

16:06.161 --> 16:08.530
not a straight shot it's very irregular

16:08.530 --> 16:11.000
and no sense of how wide open that is

16:11.000 --> 16:15.960
after that second obstruction no

16:15.960 --> 16:19.709
done and here we've got a funnel here

16:19.709 --> 16:22.209
underneath this from the grab we've got

16:22.209 --> 16:24.040
another little overhang here and

16:24.040 --> 16:26.450
underneath it you've got rock on one

16:26.450 --> 16:29.070
side rock on the other side and you have

16:29.070 --> 16:31.750
clay and it basically runs as far down

16:31.750 --> 16:35.269
into the bottom as there is clay on the

16:35.269 --> 16:37.830
bottom so this here is not more than two

16:37.830 --> 16:40.459
feet wide this way so I'm like when you

16:40.459 --> 16:42.600
got those hits and you were extremely

16:42.600 --> 16:44.899
excited what were you doing I was

16:44.899 --> 16:46.940
standing in where the hammer grab was

16:46.940 --> 16:48.000
that's what I was used to try to

16:48.000 --> 16:50.180
maintain my stability that kept getting

16:50.180 --> 16:52.910
hits in the same spot which kept trying

16:52.910 --> 16:55.440
to extend my arm and go slowly back and

16:55.440 --> 16:57.740
forth in a cross position to try to

16:57.740 --> 17:00.860
replicate those hits I feel pretty good

17:00.860 --> 17:03.330
about the survey that we did on the

17:03.330 --> 17:08.910
walls up into the over chances of it

17:08.910 --> 17:12.170
being man-made

17:12.170 --> 17:14.809
chances of it being man-made very small

17:14.809 --> 17:19.420
same small small chance in the war room

17:19.420 --> 17:21.949
Mike Huntley and John Chatterton are

17:21.949 --> 17:23.709
reporting on the dives they each

17:23.709 --> 17:26.640
performed earlier that day down to the

17:26.640 --> 17:29.290
bottom of the sea one shaft they went in

17:29.290 --> 17:31.200
there they metal detected they tried to

17:31.200 --> 17:33.520
repeat the metal detection they probed

17:33.520 --> 17:35.361
right so typical Oak Island you know I

17:35.361 --> 17:38.390
mean it's just so damn typical we don't

17:38.390 --> 17:40.660
know where this shiny gold object was

17:40.660 --> 17:43.410
was it in wall the ceiling but I was

17:43.410 --> 17:44.780
hoping need to get some hits in the

17:44.780 --> 17:48.020
floor of the cavity it really was is it

17:48.020 --> 17:50.650
possible that by widening the hole and

17:50.650 --> 17:52.360
then digging with a three-ton hammer

17:52.360 --> 17:55.310
grab tool the strange metallic object

17:55.310 --> 17:58.600
became dislodged and now lies buried at

17:58.600 --> 18:02.130
the bottom of c1 beneath several feet of

18:02.130 --> 18:05.760
clay sediment it begs the question what

18:05.760 --> 18:08.240
else can we do given that we still

18:08.240 --> 18:10.299
believe that that is something if you

18:10.299 --> 18:12.930
can flush that chamber out get better

18:12.930 --> 18:15.980
visibility in it this is a visual image

18:15.980 --> 18:18.049
that you're chasing do it in a visual

18:18.049 --> 18:21.850
way we've got this conduit a human-sized

18:21.850 --> 18:23.700
2 conduit down into that chamber are we

18:23.700 --> 18:25.900
done with that wall I don't know we

18:25.900 --> 18:28.700
might have another go at it

18:28.700 --> 18:31.650
for Rick Marty and the team until the

18:31.650 --> 18:34.400
sediment in c1 settles sufficiently and

18:34.400 --> 18:37.100
visibility is restored it is pointless

18:37.100 --> 18:38.361
to have John Chatterton

18:38.361 --> 18:39.540
or Mike on

18:39.540 --> 18:40.929
continue diving

18:40.929 --> 18:43.970
the shiny gold colored object that the

18:43.970 --> 18:46.850
team photographed last year will have to

18:46.850 --> 18:49.940
remain a mystery at least for the time

18:49.940 --> 18:52.900
being in this moment we can't say thank

18:52.900 --> 18:55.240
you enough it's been a real honor to be

18:55.240 --> 18:57.800
be part of this I'm being right back out

18:57.800 --> 18:59.450
here on that one we appreciate the

18:59.450 --> 19:01.510
effort then we may be calling you back

19:01.510 --> 19:04.350
thank you very much that job well done

19:04.350 --> 19:07.790
in my mind they see one hole was really

19:07.790 --> 19:09.670
conclusive in the sense that we're not

19:09.670 --> 19:11.940
done there I agree you know we have to

19:11.940 --> 19:15.100
again don't give up you know keep going

19:15.100 --> 19:17.570
till you get an answer and we don't have

19:17.570 --> 19:25.670
that answer yet

19:25.670 --> 19:27.740
Terry Deveau contacted me and he wants

19:27.740 --> 19:29.610
us to come out to the Peggy's Cove area

19:29.610 --> 19:32.179
and take a look at a very interesting

19:32.179 --> 19:35.030
Rock he's found heart he didn't give me

19:35.030 --> 19:36.640
too many details he just said these he's

19:36.640 --> 19:38.960
quite excited about it

19:38.960 --> 19:41.230
after being bitterly disappointed by the

19:41.230 --> 19:44.590
lack of a breakthrough at borehole Siwan

19:44.590 --> 19:47.110
Rick lagina has agreed to join area

19:47.110 --> 19:50.160
historian Charles Barkhouse on a trip

19:50.160 --> 19:52.140
which will take them some fifty miles

19:52.140 --> 19:55.240
east of Oak Island to an area known as

19:55.240 --> 19:58.590
Peggy's Cove they have been invited

19:58.590 --> 20:00.940
there by fellow researcher Terry Duvall

20:00.940 --> 20:03.710
who believes he has made an important

20:03.710 --> 20:05.330
discovery

20:05.330 --> 20:10.170
Terry how you been oh yeah good to see

20:10.170 --> 20:12.540
you again so I really want to show you

20:12.540 --> 20:15.980
this stone that I think could be pretty

20:15.980 --> 20:18.429
important now this is a stone that is

20:18.429 --> 20:20.850
not widely known myself and a few other

20:20.850 --> 20:22.400
people as far as I know are the only

20:22.400 --> 20:24.549
ones who know about it so this is

20:24.549 --> 20:27.270
something new for you guys to to take in

20:27.270 --> 20:29.010
well if it's half as intriguing is you

20:29.010 --> 20:30.250
know what you showed us last year

20:30.250 --> 20:33.500
I'm on board one year ago

20:33.500 --> 20:37.490
Terry Duvall invited Rick Marty Craig

20:37.490 --> 20:40.410
tester and Dave Blankenship to the town

20:40.410 --> 20:44.400
up Overton some 144 miles west of Oak

20:44.400 --> 20:46.230
Island

20:46.230 --> 20:47.920
there he showed them an incredible

20:47.920 --> 20:50.360
series of carvings which are believed to

20:50.360 --> 20:53.890
be hundreds of years old you have the

20:53.890 --> 20:56.830
cross with the circle that obviously is

20:56.830 --> 20:58.540
a Christian symbol that is quite

20:58.540 --> 21:00.850
remarkable and the synthetic Templar

21:00.850 --> 21:06.020
cross could Terry have found another

21:06.020 --> 21:08.770
important clue one that connects Peggy's

21:08.770 --> 21:11.460
Cove to the Oak Island mystery several

21:11.460 --> 21:17.100
miles away so Terry when exactly did you

21:17.100 --> 21:19.620
discover this stone yeah about four

21:19.620 --> 21:25.100
years ago just scouring the area around

21:25.100 --> 21:28.580
here looking for any walls or

21:28.580 --> 21:32.020
foundations or always on the lookout for

21:32.020 --> 21:34.960
petroglyphs you don't find them very

21:34.960 --> 21:38.220
often so when I notice that this

21:38.220 --> 21:41.280
particular stone had been worked as

21:41.280 --> 21:43.520
opposed to just being a purely natural

21:43.520 --> 21:46.710
boulder now obviously that really caught

21:46.710 --> 21:48.549
my attention

21:48.549 --> 21:51.820
in recent years Rick Marty and the team

21:51.820 --> 21:53.900
have found a number of strange and

21:53.900 --> 21:56.350
potentially significant stone carvings

21:56.350 --> 22:00.190
both on and around Oh Kyler's from New

22:00.190 --> 22:04.480
Ross to the Bedford Barrens is it

22:04.480 --> 22:06.910
possible that a number of these carvings

22:06.910 --> 22:08.850
were deliberately created to form a

22:08.850 --> 22:12.010
series of clues clues that would help

22:12.010 --> 22:13.820
solve the Oak Island mystery

22:13.820 --> 22:19.780
do you think you see the features

22:19.780 --> 22:23.130
definitely features see where the most

22:23.130 --> 22:27.510
the nose and in the faces this way it

22:27.510 --> 22:30.230
faces out to see yeah I'm also intrigued

22:30.230 --> 22:32.790
by you think that that was manipulated

22:32.790 --> 22:34.970
into that position because I see little

22:34.970 --> 22:37.780
rocks under exactly yeah doesn't look

22:37.780 --> 22:40.240
like there are some shims under there

22:40.240 --> 22:42.840
that were put down to make sure it

22:42.840 --> 22:46.220
stayed in that configuration and there

22:46.220 --> 22:50.620
are some modifications to the outline to

22:50.620 --> 22:53.830
make the facial features more prominent

22:53.830 --> 22:56.330
there was a face on it and a carved face

22:56.330 --> 22:58.870
when you first look at it there's

22:58.870 --> 23:00.720
definite shape dude there's something

23:00.720 --> 23:03.020
that says well that's strange-looking

23:03.020 --> 23:05.410
get a closer you look at the things that

23:05.410 --> 23:08.080
teri points out then you your mind opens

23:08.080 --> 23:10.210
up to the possibilities

23:10.210 --> 23:12.290
if you look carefully there's a

23:12.290 --> 23:16.049
difference in texture from this surface

23:16.049 --> 23:19.450
to this surface it's rougher which means

23:19.450 --> 23:23.010
it's younger maybe if you look here yeah

23:23.010 --> 23:25.970
this has been hacked off right to make

23:25.970 --> 23:27.950
the shape better - and it's not here

23:27.950 --> 23:31.970
though it even here I mean these

23:31.970 --> 23:35.270
surfaces appear to be natural weathering

23:35.270 --> 23:37.960
the result of glaciation but these

23:37.960 --> 23:41.000
surfaces look like they've been

23:41.000 --> 23:44.830
subsequently worked what else could have

23:44.830 --> 23:47.610
subsequently shaped it other than the

23:47.610 --> 23:53.480
hand of man near Peggy's Cove some 50

23:53.480 --> 23:56.280
miles from Oak Island stone carving

23:56.280 --> 23:59.480
expert Terry Duvall has just shown Rick

23:59.480 --> 24:02.559
lagina and charles barkhouse a giant

24:02.559 --> 24:04.220
boulder which he believes has been

24:04.220 --> 24:08.450
carved to resemble a human head

24:08.450 --> 24:10.430
Terry we have a headstone on Oak Island

24:10.430 --> 24:13.320
- oh that's right at the center of the

24:13.320 --> 24:17.390
animal and cross yes

24:17.390 --> 24:20.690
in 1981 while surveying his property

24:20.690 --> 24:23.440
near the center of the island Oak Island

24:23.440 --> 24:25.919
treasure hunter Fred Nolan discovered

24:25.919 --> 24:28.410
five large cone-shaped boulders that

24:28.410 --> 24:30.260
formed a megalithic perfectly

24:30.260 --> 24:33.280
symmetrical cross

24:33.280 --> 24:34.559
believing there could be something of

24:34.559 --> 24:36.520
great value buried at the center

24:36.520 --> 24:39.710
Fred dug down several feet where he came

24:39.710 --> 24:44.100
upon a sick Boulder but this one instead

24:44.100 --> 24:46.620
of being round like the others what's

24:46.620 --> 24:49.910
different because this one appeared to

24:49.910 --> 24:52.940
be carved into the shape of a human face

24:52.940 --> 24:56.929
it's the same thing you know not from

24:56.929 --> 24:58.780
every perspective because it's laying

24:58.780 --> 25:00.620
flat right now but I think if it were

25:00.620 --> 25:04.370
standing up like this surely there were

25:04.370 --> 25:06.630
similarities kind of a rough carving

25:06.630 --> 25:09.720
outlined the provenance of the nose and

25:09.720 --> 25:12.289
the nasal features and the mouth yeah

25:12.289 --> 25:14.280
and in the eye socket you know where it

25:14.280 --> 25:16.580
would be when mr. Nolan found it it was

25:16.580 --> 25:20.450
actually buried right at Oak Island

25:20.450 --> 25:22.990
there is of course no one's cross kind

25:22.990 --> 25:25.820
of the same angularity to it are they

25:25.820 --> 25:27.710
similar perhaps I might there be a

25:27.710 --> 25:30.880
connection perhaps but it's curious like

25:30.880 --> 25:33.150
everything Oak Island unfortunately one

25:33.150 --> 25:35.520
of the first things that came to mind

25:35.520 --> 25:37.740
when I first saw this as far as I can

25:37.740 --> 25:41.850
tell this is a magma relic but not only

25:41.850 --> 25:44.840
that I mean we know that the MiG MA were

25:44.840 --> 25:51.620
very active in this area the McMunn also

25:51.620 --> 25:54.190
known as the First Nation people are the

25:54.190 --> 25:56.059
original native inhabitants of Nova

25:56.059 --> 25:59.320
Scotia although much of their actual

25:59.320 --> 26:02.020
history is unknown it is widely

26:02.020 --> 26:04.130
documented that they began trading

26:04.130 --> 26:07.840
various goods including fish and furs

26:07.840 --> 26:10.660
with European explorers as far back as

26:10.660 --> 26:14.130
the 15th century

26:14.130 --> 26:16.700
the features of the face to me jump out

26:16.700 --> 26:20.410
as a mig moss style of feature that you

26:20.410 --> 26:24.470
will see and make my art even today now

26:24.470 --> 26:25.470
for me

26:25.470 --> 26:28.620
these distinctly big ma features

26:28.620 --> 26:35.049
absolutely look like a depiction of the

26:35.049 --> 26:38.970
magma god cusco do you mean Prince Henry

26:38.970 --> 26:43.179
Sinclair Prince Henry Sinclair the

26:43.179 --> 26:45.010
Templar Knight who many believed came to

26:45.010 --> 26:48.080
Nova Scotia nearly 100 years before

26:48.080 --> 26:50.130
Christopher Columbus discovered the new

26:50.130 --> 26:54.610
world in 1492 according to the folklore

26:54.610 --> 26:58.850
of the mikveh people in 1398 a

26:58.850 --> 27:00.990
mysterious white traveler arrived on the

27:00.990 --> 27:04.100
shores of Nova Scotia along with an army

27:04.100 --> 27:08.010
of men and large sailing ships

27:08.010 --> 27:09.620
after proofing that he meant them no

27:09.620 --> 27:12.640
harm the stranger taught the McMunn new

27:12.640 --> 27:14.560
waste of fish and navigate the

27:14.560 --> 27:18.190
surrounding waters in time the Mick ma

27:18.190 --> 27:20.490
came to worship this mysterious visitor

27:20.490 --> 27:23.760
as a God and gave him the name Glooscap

27:23.760 --> 27:27.270
over the years many theorists have

27:27.270 --> 27:30.080
speculated that Henry Sinclair came to

27:30.080 --> 27:33.090
Nova Scotia on a Templar mission to hide

27:33.090 --> 27:35.330
priceless religious treasures rescued

27:35.330 --> 27:36.330
from the Holy Land

27:36.330 --> 27:39.059
including the Ark of the Covenant and

27:39.059 --> 27:43.230
the golden menorah of King Solomon

27:43.230 --> 27:45.820
could this large stone carving really be

27:45.820 --> 27:48.860
a depiction of Prince Henry Sinclair and

27:48.860 --> 27:51.770
if so might it connect to the mysterious

27:51.770 --> 27:53.760
face found at the center of Nolan's

27:53.760 --> 27:58.590
cross some 50 miles away I have long

27:58.590 --> 28:01.200
believed that Glooscap was a

28:01.200 --> 28:03.809
representation of Prince Henry Sinclair

28:03.809 --> 28:06.309
and of course Prince Henry Sinclair has

28:06.309 --> 28:09.230
ties to the Templars Templars of course

28:09.230 --> 28:11.820
tied to many theories suggest that they

28:11.820 --> 28:14.140
have a connection to Oak Island so my

28:14.140 --> 28:17.250
ears perked up at that mention of that I

28:17.250 --> 28:20.010
think I truly believe there's a marathon

28:20.010 --> 28:21.260
connection here yeah that's the

28:21.260 --> 28:23.240
orientation of it how it's set up on a

28:23.240 --> 28:26.350
high prominent point you know as it was

28:26.350 --> 28:32.059
there some islands some Bay some land

28:32.059 --> 28:34.880
landing some area that this allowed

28:34.880 --> 28:38.850
peoples the big muff to sail to what we

28:38.850 --> 28:41.130
should do is take a bearing on the

28:41.130 --> 28:43.830
direction that the face is pointing you

28:43.830 --> 28:45.830
know you've been very convincing about

28:45.830 --> 28:48.929
the Glooscap but I still have this you

28:48.929 --> 28:50.820
know maybe it's a reach but I still want

28:50.820 --> 28:53.850
to know the orientation of Mahone Bay to

28:53.850 --> 28:56.049
Samara grits Bay and how this is

28:56.049 --> 29:00.520
oriented in that relation

29:00.520 --> 29:03.549
so I would say that the face is pointing

29:03.549 --> 29:07.490
pretty much due west yeah with within

29:07.490 --> 29:11.250
about five degrees of due west so it's

29:11.250 --> 29:14.130
pointing in your direction right is it

29:14.130 --> 29:16.039
possible that the carved Boulder at

29:16.039 --> 29:18.970
Peggy's Cove was deliberately positioned

29:18.970 --> 29:20.830
so that it would point in the direction

29:20.830 --> 29:24.679
of Oak Island and if so does it provide

29:24.679 --> 29:26.590
additional evidence that the Knights

29:26.590 --> 29:28.880
Templar really did hide a secret

29:28.880 --> 29:31.850
treasure there several centuries ago you

29:31.850 --> 29:35.539
know might it be a bit of a stretch yes

29:35.539 --> 29:38.620
but there's so many unknowns and that's

29:38.620 --> 29:39.980
part of what you're trying to do is

29:39.980 --> 29:43.770
uncover history yes the unknown history

29:43.770 --> 29:49.690
leave no stone unturned this is as much

29:49.690 --> 29:51.919
information hunters treasure hunt the

29:51.919 --> 29:54.000
information hunt perhaps will get you to

29:54.000 --> 29:56.280
the treasure hunt and indeed the

29:56.280 --> 29:58.559
treasure the mystery the story of Oak

29:58.559 --> 30:01.580
Island military look I congratulate you

30:01.580 --> 30:03.520
on your fine it said it's intriguing as

30:03.520 --> 30:05.080
always the amount of work you've

30:05.080 --> 30:07.050
dedicated to the pursuit of for either

30:07.050 --> 30:09.280
revisiting history or changing history

30:09.280 --> 30:12.080
you're to be applauded but the damning

30:12.080 --> 30:14.419
part of it is if I may say so is you've

30:14.419 --> 30:17.250
just given us more questions always more

30:17.250 --> 30:19.460
questions what right records to pleasure

30:19.460 --> 30:20.830
I can't judge you're able to come visit

30:20.830 --> 30:23.120
our stone here this egon thanks Charles

30:23.120 --> 30:30.970
after a year that has seen breakthroughs

30:30.970 --> 30:32.419
in the swamp

30:32.419 --> 30:38.669
maybe a ship's plank and on property

30:38.669 --> 30:41.140
that was once owned by former American

30:41.140 --> 30:43.740
slaves Samuel ball I think this is an

30:43.740 --> 30:47.610
encampment this is quite a haul Wow 1700

30:47.610 --> 30:50.700
that changes a lot the laginas and their

30:50.700 --> 30:52.910
partners are frustrated that their

30:52.910 --> 30:54.830
enormous engineering efforts in the

30:54.830 --> 30:57.780
money pit area have not produced similar

30:57.780 --> 31:05.640
results we need to get Craig Craig we

31:05.640 --> 31:07.700
got some big decisions to make you know

31:07.700 --> 31:09.309
we're kind of up against it now there's

31:09.309 --> 31:11.340
only so much in the budget and there's a

31:11.340 --> 31:13.960
couple competing projects in an effort

31:13.960 --> 31:16.659
to regain momentum and make the most of

31:16.659 --> 31:18.380
this summer's rapidly shrinking

31:18.380 --> 31:20.640
operating budget the laginas have

31:20.640 --> 31:23.340
invited their partners Craig tester and

31:23.340 --> 31:26.280
Dan and Dave Blankenship to join them in

31:26.280 --> 31:28.250
the war room for an important meeting

31:28.250 --> 31:31.000
the core of this meeting really is that

31:31.000 --> 31:32.990
we have financial constraints at this

31:32.990 --> 31:35.250
point and the decision to be made really

31:35.250 --> 31:39.010
is where do we go from here there's only

31:39.010 --> 31:41.230
so much money there's only so much that

31:41.230 --> 31:44.039
we can do and the two looming things

31:44.039 --> 31:47.190
that should be done are jetting 10x

31:47.190 --> 31:49.640
which we've talked about many times and

31:49.640 --> 31:51.290
digging a third hole in the money pit

31:51.290 --> 31:52.970
and it's gonna be tough to decide what

31:52.970 --> 31:56.480
we do we have the gear we have Irving up

31:56.480 --> 31:58.270
at the money pit and we have to make a

31:58.270 --> 32:03.140
decision today 10x

32:03.140 --> 32:05.549
when you say 10x what do you mean by

32:05.549 --> 32:07.669
that blow the water out of it

32:07.669 --> 32:09.410
airlift it all out see what's down there

32:09.410 --> 32:11.220
and if it doesn't collapse then we go

32:11.220 --> 32:12.990
down there and see what is down there

32:12.990 --> 32:18.659
okay but as I understand it even the

32:18.659 --> 32:21.880
airlift 10x is relatively the same cost

32:21.880 --> 32:24.279
it's digging this next hole in the money

32:24.279 --> 32:26.860
pit where we gonna put it we've got no

32:26.860 --> 32:29.970
data no hard evidence on should put it

32:29.970 --> 32:34.200
let's go wrong the table for me its

32:34.200 --> 32:38.330
tenants wait a minute wait a minute

32:38.330 --> 32:39.730
you're saying if it's got to be one or

32:39.730 --> 32:41.120
the other you want to take the remaining

32:41.120 --> 32:43.919
budget and go to 10x with it I want

32:43.919 --> 32:48.480
answers in 10x this year right right

32:48.480 --> 32:51.299
I've always had a desire to do what my

32:51.299 --> 32:54.429
brother says put an X through things and

32:54.429 --> 32:57.020
we still have ambiguity in 10x after all

32:57.020 --> 32:58.940
kinds of attempts

32:58.940 --> 33:00.820
perhaps this will decide once and for

33:00.820 --> 33:02.550
all yay or nay

33:02.550 --> 33:05.309
I got an objection of that Rick because

33:05.309 --> 33:09.110
we will never ever be able to dig as

33:09.110 --> 33:10.860
cheap as we can right now with all that

33:10.860 --> 33:13.830
equipment mobilized up there you Craig

33:13.830 --> 33:17.740
you want to weigh in on that I'm

33:17.740 --> 33:20.320
definitely for the money pit to do it

33:20.320 --> 33:22.620
sometime in the future it's just really

33:22.620 --> 33:25.549
high cost you know I just think about

33:25.549 --> 33:27.300
one more in the money pit and hold off

33:27.300 --> 33:30.470
on 10x if one has to be sacrificed I

33:30.470 --> 33:31.650
don't think we can give up the

33:31.650 --> 33:34.820
opportunity to dig yeah I see you

33:34.820 --> 33:37.250
dilemma you're damned if you do and

33:37.250 --> 33:38.580
you're damned if you don't

33:38.580 --> 33:39.641
right but if there has to be a

33:39.641 --> 33:43.340
sacrificial lamb I'd rather give up 10x

33:43.340 --> 33:45.080
yeah

33:45.080 --> 33:50.440
hey Dan you've never lost faith in 10x

33:50.440 --> 33:52.059
have you you believe it's there's

33:52.059 --> 33:53.059
something there

33:53.059 --> 33:55.030
I believe what I see I believe what I

33:55.030 --> 33:56.980
can look at I believe in what can be

33:56.980 --> 33:59.919
analyzed you saw that what came out of

33:59.919 --> 34:04.580
10x and in my opinion I would stay in

34:04.580 --> 34:10.280
connection because I mean that that's

34:10.280 --> 34:13.210
where the actual tangible evidence came

34:13.210 --> 34:15.810
from that if we sent away and had sister

34:15.810 --> 34:19.469
and you also know by this time that

34:19.469 --> 34:21.599
basically what I think theirs is that

34:21.599 --> 34:24.250
the original site of the so-called money

34:24.250 --> 34:27.060
pit has been lost over the years the

34:27.060 --> 34:29.290
money pit area is the crapshoot it's a

34:29.290 --> 34:32.159
real crapshoot I understand that by like

34:32.159 --> 34:34.560
NX do you have to honor people's

34:34.560 --> 34:37.339
position in the hunt but I think a lot

34:37.339 --> 34:38.510
of these decisions over here are

34:38.510 --> 34:40.918
emotional we coach them in terms of

34:40.918 --> 34:43.340
logic I'd like to think that I apply

34:43.340 --> 34:45.600
logic but you know I'm probably as

34:45.600 --> 34:47.639
emotional as anybody else in my own way

34:47.639 --> 34:50.770
and and the decisions are combination of

34:50.770 --> 34:52.600
logic and emotion hell it's like Star

34:52.600 --> 34:56.369
Trek all over again I agree we need to

34:56.369 --> 35:00.099
make a decision today and that's that's

35:00.099 --> 35:02.730
that's difficult given our uncertainties

35:02.730 --> 35:05.100
here and our differences in terms of

35:05.100 --> 35:08.380
what the agenda well that's where I'm in

35:08.380 --> 35:09.990
one way I'm gonna offer up something

35:09.990 --> 35:21.050
myself and you're gonna be surprised

35:21.050 --> 35:23.600
find myself somewhat outvoted at this

35:23.600 --> 35:27.340
point I which is very unusual it is kind

35:27.340 --> 35:29.890
of in a meeting in the oak island war

35:29.890 --> 35:32.750
room Rick Marty and their partners find

35:32.750 --> 35:36.200
themselves at logistical crossroads

35:36.200 --> 35:38.030
having already exhausted most of their

35:38.030 --> 35:40.400
finances for the year they are

35:40.400 --> 35:42.680
struggling to come to an agreement on

35:42.680 --> 35:45.230
whether to dig a third large hole in the

35:45.230 --> 35:48.760
money pit or return to their exploration

35:48.760 --> 35:53.070
of borehole 10-x how close are we

35:53.070 --> 35:56.110
budget-wise are we close the optimist in

35:56.110 --> 35:58.520
me says we could do both that's what the

35:58.520 --> 36:01.320
optimist says but we may not be able to

36:01.320 --> 36:03.150
have our cake and eat it too

36:03.150 --> 36:04.760
we might have to reach in our pockets a

36:04.760 --> 36:13.609
little further yeah

36:13.609 --> 36:15.109
you know what here's what I think

36:15.109 --> 36:19.070
basically if I was searching my soul at

36:19.070 --> 36:20.890
this point in the end I'm gonna decide

36:20.890 --> 36:23.099
it because of Dan because I respect him

36:23.099 --> 36:25.830
he wants to do 10x we owe it to him

36:25.830 --> 36:28.390
right I don't want I say oh hell let's

36:28.390 --> 36:29.390
go for broke

36:29.390 --> 36:30.940
let's do them both even though we don't

36:30.940 --> 36:32.470
really have the budget let's do them

36:32.470 --> 36:40.560
both hey shake the dice as you know one

36:40.560 --> 36:41.560
condition

36:41.560 --> 36:44.740
oh here we go now first we airlift

36:44.740 --> 36:46.270
airlift the hell out of it before before

36:46.270 --> 36:49.240
we put a person in there nicely with you

36:49.240 --> 36:51.310
you're with me I'm with him I think we

36:51.310 --> 36:54.050
should do it what do you say Craig if we

36:54.050 --> 36:57.410
keep the cost reasonable you know

36:57.410 --> 36:59.140
hopefully the airlift gets rid of the

36:59.140 --> 37:01.170
dough you know we come up with anything

37:01.170 --> 37:03.320
that I mean anything a hinge of a strap

37:03.320 --> 37:05.860
piece of gold that right shiny stuff

37:05.860 --> 37:08.000
then yeah then it justifies the risk in

37:08.000 --> 37:10.490
the trains and everything else yes great

37:10.490 --> 37:11.490
yeah okay

37:11.490 --> 37:14.099
I'm relieved you know I mean we were it

37:14.099 --> 37:15.690
was agony really trying to decide what

37:15.690 --> 37:17.420
to do but you know what by god

37:17.420 --> 37:19.599
we're here to try and get something done

37:19.599 --> 37:22.300
this year and what the heck we're going

37:22.300 --> 37:25.310
for broke we'll get them both done all I

37:25.310 --> 37:27.000
have to do is do this

37:27.000 --> 37:30.140
and we're here too we're here to solve

37:30.140 --> 37:32.680
it okay it sounds like we've rallied to

37:32.680 --> 37:35.420
a consensus yep okay the Fellowship of

37:35.420 --> 37:38.270
The Dig goes for broke that we're gonna

37:38.270 --> 37:39.359
finally break Oak Island

37:39.359 --> 37:53.600
now Scott yeah that didn't take much

37:53.600 --> 37:57.619
just as if another year had begun the

37:57.619 --> 37:59.770
laginas and their partners are once

37:59.770 --> 38:03.080
again re-energized and rededicated to

38:03.080 --> 38:08.490
solving a 221 year old mystery that's

38:08.490 --> 38:13.970
quite impressive today's operations will

38:13.970 --> 38:17.290
begin at borehole 10-x where with the

38:17.290 --> 38:19.490
help of the crew from urban equipment

38:19.490 --> 38:22.190
limited the team will use an airlift

38:22.190 --> 38:24.490
system to pump hundreds of pounds of

38:24.490 --> 38:27.000
sediment and hopefully evidence of

38:27.000 --> 38:30.380
treasure from 235 feet underground

38:30.380 --> 38:36.240
you're only a step or two away from

38:36.240 --> 38:38.869
starting up go up there and talk with

38:38.869 --> 38:44.270
Andrew see where they're at open there

38:44.270 --> 38:45.820
and swing

38:45.820 --> 38:49.460
hey mornin mornin how are you boys

38:49.460 --> 38:52.880
good good yeah just the one there yes

38:52.880 --> 38:55.670
the air lifts in the hole there now so

38:55.670 --> 38:57.460
far so good we just got to make this

38:57.460 --> 38:59.890
connection to the cyclone here now once

38:59.890 --> 39:01.359
that's done we'll start thinkin

39:01.359 --> 39:06.130
bressler's and start drawing some water

39:06.130 --> 39:08.500
I think airlift is an appropriate agenda

39:08.500 --> 39:11.410
if you won't mr. Blankenship has long

39:11.410 --> 39:13.970
advocated that position there sediment

39:13.970 --> 39:15.900
in the bottom of 10x and that's why we

39:15.900 --> 39:18.680
don't have visuals on objects on the

39:18.680 --> 39:21.270
floor which he believes are there mr.

39:21.270 --> 39:24.430
Blankenship deserves this opportunity so

39:24.430 --> 39:30.540
we have to find something good good so

39:30.540 --> 39:36.500
what do you think that's a message you

39:36.500 --> 39:39.410
got it's not like anything I have read I

39:39.410 --> 39:43.730
guarantee you so we lowered the pipe

39:43.730 --> 39:46.140
down in the cavity today never felt any

39:46.140 --> 39:49.150
resistance whatsoever so once we turn on

39:49.150 --> 39:51.900
the air compressors the air will go down

39:51.900 --> 39:53.580
it'll force its way back up its gonna

39:53.580 --> 39:56.490
draw the water and the spoils it's all

39:56.490 --> 39:57.900
gonna come out through that black hose

39:57.900 --> 40:00.060
into the yellow cyclone and then from

40:00.060 --> 40:01.920
there we got these two pumps right here

40:01.920 --> 40:03.550
that's gonna draw the water back into

40:03.550 --> 40:06.520
10x well with your permission we'll turn

40:06.520 --> 40:08.070
it on right now we'll see what happens

40:08.070 --> 40:11.340
okay all right you guys good to go yep

40:11.340 --> 40:14.660
all right thanks Andrew thank you good

40:14.660 --> 40:19.079
luck to all of us amen amen

40:19.079 --> 40:20.339
all right

40:20.339 --> 40:23.450
this is exciting yes because if

40:23.450 --> 40:25.020
something comes up from this airlift

40:25.020 --> 40:27.030
that we hold in our hands some man-made

40:27.030 --> 40:29.200
object whether it's a coin and implement

40:29.200 --> 40:31.250
a tool part of the chest

40:31.250 --> 40:34.000
something that screams further

40:34.000 --> 40:36.210
investigation at that point I am

40:36.210 --> 40:39.890
absolutely 100% committed to drawing it

40:39.890 --> 40:42.710
up and going down

40:42.710 --> 40:47.640
with the airlift operation at 10x and

40:47.640 --> 40:50.770
the promise of a third major excavation

40:50.770 --> 40:54.490
at the money pit to soon follow Rick

40:54.490 --> 40:57.100
Marty and the team are more determined

40:57.100 --> 40:59.450
than ever to solve the Oak Island

40:59.450 --> 41:01.440
mystery

41:01.440 --> 41:02.920
what will their latest go-for-broke

41:02.920 --> 41:05.580
strategy pay off with the discovery of a

41:05.580 --> 41:10.329
vast treasure or will the island manage

41:10.329 --> 41:14.950
to keep its secrets hidden one fact is

41:14.950 --> 41:15.950
certain

41:15.950 --> 41:19.080
a mystery that is so far claimed six

41:19.080 --> 41:22.540
lives will not be solved without a

41:22.540 --> 41:28.240
sacrifice

41:28.240 --> 41:30.720
next time on the curse of Oak Island in

41:30.720 --> 41:35.670
that dumpster there's something that

41:35.670 --> 41:42.640
comes from the law we'll find it

41:42.640 --> 41:44.060
that's a phone dan believes that there

41:44.060 --> 41:45.480
is a body going there we're back

41:45.480 --> 41:47.160
in ten arcs we know that FDR was

41:47.160 --> 41:48.960
interested in the treasure hunt here on

41:48.960 --> 41:50.799
Oak Island we will define the

41:50.799 --> 41:52.640
president's personal file to guess what

41:52.640 --> 41:54.670
I found in that folder that's remarkable

41:54.694 --> 41:56.694
