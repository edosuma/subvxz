14:40.659 --> 14:41.960
<b>- Wow.</b>

14:41.961 --> 14:43.795
<b>- Who agrees to tattoo</b>
<b>this kind of symbol</b>

14:43.796 --> 14:45.563
<b>on somebody for the rest</b>
<b>of their life?</b>

14:45.564 --> 14:48.132
<b>You have no moral values.</b>
<b>What is your name?</b>

14:48.133 --> 14:50.034
<b>Where can I find you,</b>
<b>and I will cover</b>

14:50.035 --> 14:52.503
<b>your face up with my boot.</b>

14:52.504 --> 14:55.373
<b>- Your canvases to day regret</b>
<b>getting these tattoos,</b>

14:55.374 --> 14:57.675
<b>so you must help them</b>
<b>by transforming</b>

14:57.676 --> 15:00.011
<b>these symbols of hate</b>
<b>into something new.</b>

15:00.012 --> 15:01.846
<b>- It's one thing when it's</b>
<b>an old, crappy koi fish</b>

15:01.847 --> 15:03.615
<b>that was drawn in the '90s,</b>
<b>but when it's</b>

15:03.616 --> 15:05.650
<b>something serious like this,</b>
<b>it really affects</b>

15:05.651 --> 15:08.052
<b>how people look at them...</b>
<b>it's very important.</b>

15:08.053 --> 15:09.387
<b>- Remember, one of you guys</b>

15:09.388 --> 15:11.155
<b>is gonna move</b>
<b>out of this finale.</b>

15:11.156 --> 15:12.523
<b>Do the best you can.</b>

15:12.524 --> 15:14.525
<b>- Let's meet your canvases.</b>

<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

15:20.432 --> 15:22.433
<b>James, you won</b>
<b>the flash challenge.</b>

15:22.434 --> 15:24.636
<b>You have the power</b>
<b>to assign the canvases.</b>

15:24.637 --> 15:27.105
<b>A spot in the top four</b>
<b>is on the line,</b>

15:27.106 --> 15:30.642
<b>so be strategic.</b>

15:30.643 --> 15:33.444
<b>- My strategy is "take out</b>
<b>Christian and Anthony."</b>

15:33.445 --> 15:35.546
<b>I'm trying to keep</b>
<b>all the veterans in this.</b>

15:35.547 --> 15:36.581
<b>What you want to get done?</b>
<b>- Uh...</b>

15:36.582 --> 15:37.949
<b>I got a swastika and iron cross</b>

15:37.950 --> 15:39.751
<b>I want to get done...</b>
<b>wrong part of my life.</b>

15:39.752 --> 15:41.552
<b>Now I know where I'm at,</b>

15:41.553 --> 15:43.087
<b>- Any ideas what you want</b>
<b>to do with it?</b>

15:43.088 --> 15:45.123
<b>- Maybe, like, a zombie nurse</b>
<b>cemetery scene.</b>

15:45.124 --> 15:46.457
<b>- All right. All right.</b>

15:46.458 --> 15:47.592
<b>- 'Cause I got to get it</b>
<b>out of there.</b>

15:47.593 --> 15:48.926
<b>I got kids, and my kids hate it.</b>

15:48.927 --> 15:52.030
<b>- Mm... please do not</b>
<b>give me a swastika.</b>

15:52.031 --> 15:53.498

<b> <i>At one point in this guy's life,</i> </b>

15:54.967 --> 15:56.501

<b>- What would you like</b>
<b>to get done, brother?</b>

15:57.970 --> 15:59.337
<b>- A color realism zombie</b>

15:59.338 --> 16:00.505
<b>covering up a Confederate flag.</b>

16:00.506 --> 16:01.906
<b>- Piece of cake.</b>
<b>- Ma'am?</b>

16:01.907 --> 16:03.641
<b>- I'd like to get this covered.</b>
<b>- [exhales]</b>

16:03.642 --> 16:05.610

16:05.611 --> 16:07.545
<b>- Awesome.</b> <b>What would you like?</b>

16:07.546 --> 16:09.714
<b>- I'm getting this swastika</b>
<b>covered up here.</b>

16:09.715 --> 16:11.282
<b>- Wow.</b>
<b>- It's pretty nasty.</b>

16:11.283 --> 16:12.350
<b>- [exhales]</b>

16:12.351 --> 16:13.584
<b>- I want a World War II tribute</b>

16:13.585 --> 16:15.620
<b>to turn a negative</b>
<b>into a positive.</b>

16:15.621 --> 16:17.288
<b>- Difficult.</b>
<b>- Right.</b>

16:17.289 --> 16:18.690
<b> <i>That's a ridiculously</i> </b>
<b> <i>hard cover-up</i> </b>

16:18.691 --> 16:20.325
<b> <i>because it's big and bold,</i> </b>

<b>and it's right in the middle</b>

16:21.794 --> 16:23.928
<b>It's gonna be really difficult</b>
<b>to cover up.</b>

16:23.929 --> 16:25.830
<b>- What would you like?</b>

16:25.831 --> 16:27.865
<b>Phew.</b>

16:27.866 --> 16:29.634
<b>I see a lot of these</b>
<b>in South Carolina.</b>

16:29.635 --> 16:30.969
<b>- I'd like to get</b>
<b>the whole thing</b>

16:30.970 --> 16:32.036
<b>covered up, if I could.</b>

16:32.037 --> 16:33.237
<b>- Both of 'em done?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

16:33.238 --> 16:34.372
<b>- What were you thinking</b>
<b>about doing?</b>

16:34.373 --> 16:36.574
<b>- I'm open.</b>
<b>- All right.</b>

16:36.575 --> 16:38.743
<b>- I'm pretty worried about</b>
<b>what James's strategy is</b>

16:38.744 --> 16:40.278
<b>going into this because</b>
<b>he keeps talking</b>

16:40.279 --> 16:41.946
<b> <i>about having</i> </b> <b> <i>a three-vet finale.</i> </b>

<b>on a day where we're</b>

16:47.219 --> 16:48.486
<b>- [sighs]</b>

16:48.487 --> 16:49.821
<b>- Canvases, one by one,</b>

<b>please read the artist's name</b>

16:51.490 --> 16:54.560
<b>on the bottom of your skull.</b>

16:57.229 --> 16:58.563
<b>- Anthony.</b>

16:58.564 --> 16:59.998
<b>- I don't know if James</b>
<b>is testing me</b>

16:59.999 --> 17:01.265
<b>with the hate or the tattoo.</b>

17:01.266 --> 17:02.367
<b>Damn.</b>

17:02.368 --> 17:03.501
<b> <i>I can't let it get to me.</i> </b>

17:03.502 --> 17:04.535
<b> <i>I need to keep my composure</i> </b>

17:04.536 --> 17:06.104
<b>so I stay focused.</b>

17:06.105 --> 17:08.705
<b>- What is she covering?</b>
<b>- The "A" on her chest.</b>

17:08.707 --> 17:10.809
<b>- James.</b>

17:13.878 --> 17:15.613
<b>- Christian.</b>

17:15.614 --> 17:18.616
<b>- This ought to be interesting.</b>

17:18.617 --> 17:20.417
<b>- I'm gonna guess</b>
<b>I got this one.</b>

17:20.419 --> 17:22.987
<b>- Cleen Rock One.</b>

17:22.988 --> 17:24.555
<b>- Oh, yeah.</b>

17:24.556 --> 17:26.590
<b> <i>James gave me this</i> </b>
<b> <i>big ol' boy's arm.</i> </b>

17:26.592 --> 17:28.926
<b>Just because I can</b>
<b>do big tattoos doesn't mean</b>

17:28.927 --> 17:32.630
<b>I want to do big tattoos</b>
<b>all the time.</b>

17:32.631 --> 17:34.899
<b>- There it is.</b>
<b>- Pretty easy.</b>

17:34.900 --> 17:36.969
<b>- Matti.</b>

17:38.570 --> 17:40.805
<b> <i>- Matti definitely got</i> </b>
<b> <i>the easiest pick of all.</i> </b>

17:40.806 --> 17:42.974
<b>It shows me that he's</b>
<b>using his influence</b>

17:42.975 --> 17:44.542
<b>on both sides of the coin.</b>

17:44.543 --> 17:45.843
<b> <i>I don't trust him any more</i> </b>
<b> <i>than I would</i> </b>

17:45.844 --> 17:47.812
<b>anybody else in the competition</b>
<b>at this point.</b>

17:47.813 --> 17:50.214
<b>- Remember, after</b>
<b>the elimination tattoo,</b>

17:50.215 --> 17:52.550
<b>the human canvas jury</b>
<b>will vote on the tattoo</b>

17:52.551 --> 17:53.985
<b>that they think is the worst,</b>

17:53.986 --> 17:56.254
<b>and put one artist up</b>
<b>for elimination.</b>

17:56.255 --> 17:58.022
<b>You'll have six hours</b>

17:58.023 --> 18:00.158
<b>to cover up a hate tattoo.</b>

18:00.159 --> 18:01.192
<b>Based on your work,</b>

18:01.193 --> 18:03.494
<b>one of you will close shop.</b>

18:03.495 --> 18:05.830
<b>Good luck.</b>

18:05.831 --> 18:07.198
<b>- What's up, dude?</b>
<b>- Let's take a look</b>

18:07.199 --> 18:08.333
<b>at this thing and figure out</b>

18:08.334 --> 18:09.901
<b>what's gonna be a good option.</b>

18:09.902 --> 18:11.202
<b>- Today, these artists</b>
<b>are gonna be</b>

18:11.203 --> 18:12.804
<b>covering up hate tattoos,</b>

18:12.805 --> 18:14.806
<b> <i>and they really have to put</i> </b>
<b> <i>everything aside</i> </b>

18:14.807 --> 18:16.708
<b>and do the best cover-up</b>
<b>they possibly can.</b>

18:16.709 --> 18:18.042
<b>- What's going on?</b>
<b>What's the story behind that?</b>

18:18.043 --> 18:19.844
<b>- I was just brainwashed</b>
<b>when I was younger.</b>

18:19.845 --> 18:21.646
<b>And when I got older</b>
<b>and had kids,</b>

18:21.647 --> 18:23.014
<b>I realized, man,</b>
<b>"what the hell?"</b>

18:23.015 --> 18:24.382
<b>Trying to do a 360.</b>

18:24.383 --> 18:25.650
<b>- Well, I'd love to help, man.</b>
<b>- Hell yeah.</b>

18:25.651 --> 18:27.885
<b>I appreciate that.</b> <b>- Right on.</b>

18:27.886 --> 18:30.588
<b>- Ingenuity is always going to</b>
<b>play into the cover-up.</b>

18:30.589 --> 18:32.557
<b> <i>You should never be able</i> </b>
<b> <i>to pick out a section</i> </b>

18:32.558 --> 18:34.025
<b>where you know the cover-up is.</b>

18:34.026 --> 18:36.160
<b>That's the biggest fail.</b>

18:36.161 --> 18:38.630
<b>- I wanted a cross with a helmet</b>
<b>coming off of it.</b>

18:38.631 --> 18:39.998
<b>- That's basically</b>
<b>a soldier's cross.</b>

18:39.999 --> 18:41.299
<b>- Exactly.</b>

18:41.300 --> 18:43.001
<b> <i>- My biggest concern</i> </b>
<b> <i>about this tattoo</i> </b>

18:43.002 --> 18:44.535
<b>is that it's really large,</b>
<b>and some weird tattoo</b>

18:44.536 --> 18:46.170
<b>going right through the middle.</b>

18:46.171 --> 18:47.772
<b> <i>She wants a soldier's cross,</i> </b>
<b> <i>but it's not</i> </b>

18:47.773 --> 18:49.240
<b>big enough to cover this thing.</b>

18:49.241 --> 18:53.144
<b>Uh, anything else if this</b>
<b>didn't work for you?</b>

18:53.145 --> 18:54.712
<b>- No way.</b>
<b>- [sighs]</b>

18:54.713 --> 18:56.914
<b>If this were in my shop,</b>
<b>it would take me three days</b>

18:56.915 --> 18:58.816
<b>to come up with a design</b>
<b>to cover it properly.</b>

18:58.817 --> 19:01.719
<b>I don't know what I'm gonna do.</b>

19:01.720 --> 19:03.554
<b>- Color works great</b>
<b>for cover-ups.</b>

19:03.555 --> 19:05.056
<b>- Anything that'll</b>
<b>get rid of it.</b>

19:05.057 --> 19:06.591
<b>- Let's see here, um...</b>

19:06.592 --> 19:08.693
<b>There's no way I could do</b>
<b>just the Confederate flag</b>

19:08.694 --> 19:10.028
<b>and leave the grim reaper</b>

19:10.029 --> 19:11.729
<b>because they're</b>
<b>so close together.</b>

19:11.730 --> 19:13.364
<b>If I do one, the other one's</b>

19:13.365 --> 19:15.133
<b>gonna stick out</b>
<b>like a sore thumb.</b>

19:15.134 --> 19:18.136
<b>Maybe if I did, like, a big</b>
<b>skull up to here.</b>

19:18.137 --> 19:19.504
<b>Might have to get super crazy,</b>

19:19.505 --> 19:21.506
<b>because I got a dark streak</b>
<b>going this way.</b>

19:21.507 --> 19:23.041
<b>That's a big arm too.</b>

19:23.042 --> 19:24.342
<b> <i>I'm gonna have to do</i> </b>
<b> <i>a half-sleeve</i> </b>

19:24.343 --> 19:25.710
<b> <i>to cover up these tattoos.</i> </b>

19:25.711 --> 19:27.412
<b>You know how hard it is</b>
<b>to do a half-sleeve</b>

19:27.413 --> 19:28.513
<b> <i>in six hours?</i> </b>

19:28.514 --> 19:29.547
<b>It's tough.</b>

19:29.548 --> 19:30.648
<b>Only got six hours to do it,</b>

19:30.649 --> 19:32.016
<b>and so I don't want to end up</b>

19:32.017 --> 19:34.119
<b>doing something that's</b>
<b>not finished.</b>

19:36.420 --> 19:39.989
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

19:39.990 --> 19:41.690
<b>- I kind of want</b>
<b>to ask you something</b>

19:41.691 --> 19:43.359
<b>just, like, straightforward.</b>

19:43.360 --> 19:44.393
<b>- Go ahead.</b>

19:44.394 --> 19:45.895
<b>- I kind of have this feeling</b>

19:45.896 --> 19:47.730
<b>that you're sort of playing</b>
<b>both sides of it.</b>

19:47.731 --> 19:48.964
<b>- How so, though?</b>

19:48.965 --> 19:50.599
<b>- You've been talking</b>
<b>to James a lot,</b>

19:50.600 --> 19:52.568
<b>and he threw you</b>
<b>a really nice canvas,</b>

19:52.569 --> 19:54.003
<b>and I think he hit me hard.</b>

19:54.004 --> 19:56.172
<b>- He could have been trying</b>
<b>to toss you that one</b>

19:56.173 --> 19:57.640
<b>because it was black and gray,</b>
<b>and he thought</b>

19:57.641 --> 19:58.641
<b>you could knock it</b>
<b>out of the park.</b>

19:58.642 --> 20:00.009
<b>- I don't buy that.</b>

20:00.010 --> 20:01.944
<b>- He intentionally gave me</b>
<b>a harder skull.</b>

20:01.945 --> 20:03.112
<b>- Oh, yeah.</b>
<b>- What James did</b>

20:03.113 --> 20:04.580
<b>was basically his decision.</b>

20:04.581 --> 20:06.248
<b>- I also know that he wants</b>

20:06.249 --> 20:07.716
<b>an all-vet finale,</b>

20:07.717 --> 20:09.452
<b>and that puts you</b>
<b>right in the middle.</b>

20:09.453 --> 20:10.686
<b>You got the vets that say, "hey,</b>"

20:10.687 --> 20:12.188
<b>let's make it</b>
<b>an all-vet finale."</b>

20:12.189 --> 20:14.490
<b>You got us saying, "hey, let's</b>
<b>make it an us finale."</b>

20:14.491 --> 20:15.991
<b>So, you're winning either way.</b>

20:15.992 --> 20:18.127
<b>- I won't throw you ever [bleep]</b>
<b>under the bus,</b>

20:18.128 --> 20:20.796
<b>because that was never part of</b>
<b>this original deal.</b>

20:20.797 --> 20:22.932
<b>- As long as I know that</b>
<b>you're still on board.</b>

20:22.933 --> 20:25.468
<b>- Yeah, that's exactly</b>
<b>how it'll be.</b>

20:25.469 --> 20:27.737
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

20:27.738 --> 20:29.305
<b>- All right, guys,</b>
<b>you have six hours</b>

20:29.306 --> 20:32.007
<b>to help your canvases</b>
<b>make a fresh start</b>

20:32.008 --> 20:34.376
<b>by covering up a hate tattoo,</b>

20:34.377 --> 20:37.980
<b>and your time starts now.</b>

20:37.981 --> 20:39.415
<b>- Let's kick its ass.</b>
<b>- Let's go.</b>

20:39.416 --> 20:41.484
<b>- The less people that are</b>
<b>on this competition,</b>

20:41.485 --> 20:42.952
<b>the more intense it gets,</b>

20:42.953 --> 20:45.388

<b>with something so negative</b>
<b>on your skin.</b>

20:51.962 --> 20:53.362

<b>- That's gonna be a sick piece</b>

20:59.803 --> 21:01.070
<b>- If you can look at the tattoo</b>

<b>My canvas wants</b>

<b> <i>- I mean, it wasn't easy.</i> </b>

28:20.568 --> 28:22.002
<b> <i>His arm's as big as my leg,</i> </b>

28:22.003 --> 28:23.870
<b>and, you know, the tattoos</b>
<b>that he has...</b>

28:23.871 --> 28:26.606
<b> <i>just the flag itself is</i> </b>
<b> <i>a pretty good size.</i> </b>

28:26.607 --> 28:28.508
<b>- Overall, man,</b>
<b>it's a big, solid,</b>

28:28.509 --> 28:30.010
<b>saturated tattoo.</b>

28:30.011 --> 28:32.112
<b> <i>Your ingenuity here was</i> </b>
<b> <i>coming up with a design</i> </b>

28:32.113 --> 28:34.414
<b> <i>that could get rid of</i> </b>
<b> <i>both of these tattoos,</i> </b>

28:34.415 --> 28:36.082
<b>but I'm just not a fan</b>
<b>of the drawing.</b>

28:36.083 --> 28:37.951
<b>These helmets, in real life,</b>
<b>they are black,</b>

28:37.952 --> 28:40.086
<b> <i>and now it's just bright</i> </b>
<b> <i>bubblegum blue.</i> </b>

28:40.087 --> 28:42.989
<b>Almost looks like it would be</b>
<b>a baseball batting helmet</b>

28:42.990 --> 28:45.358
<b>as opposed to, like, a</b>
<b>motorcycle helmet or something.</b>

28:45.359 --> 28:46.559
<b>The upper jaw?</b>

28:46.560 --> 28:48.395
<b> <i>If you just draw those teeth</i> </b>

28:48.396 --> 28:49.663
<b> <i>and then cover it</i> </b>
<b> <i>with the fabric,</i> </b>

28:49.664 --> 28:50.730
<b>the fabric wouldn't pull</b>

28:50.731 --> 28:52.132
<b>directly back like that.</b>

28:52.133 --> 28:53.400
<b>It would stick out, but,</b>

28:53.401 --> 28:54.434
<b> <i>as far as the cover-up goes,</i> </b>

28:54.435 --> 28:55.835
<b> <i>you did this client a service.</i> </b>

28:55.836 --> 28:57.437
<b> <i>You had to cover up two tattoos,</i> </b>

28:57.438 --> 29:02.008
<b> <i>and I think you</i> </b>
<b> <i>achieved it strongly.</i> </b>

29:02.009 --> 29:03.376
<b>- Matti.</b>

29:03.377 --> 29:04.611
<b>You got one of the...</b>

29:04.612 --> 29:05.679
<b>- Easiest cover-ups</b>
<b>on the planet?</b>

29:05.680 --> 29:06.913
<b>- Yeah, one of the easier ones.</b>

29:06.914 --> 29:08.381
<b>What did you think</b>
<b>when you got this one?</b>

29:08.382 --> 29:09.683
<b>- Well, I had to do</b>
<b>another zombie.</b>

29:09.684 --> 29:11.017
<b> <i>So, I had to come up</i> </b>
<b> <i>with something</i> </b>

29:11.018 --> 29:12.886
<b> <i>completely different,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and hopefully,</i> </b>

29:12.887 --> 29:14.354
<b> <i>I gave you guys something</i> </b>
<b> <i>we haven't seen yet.</i> </b>

29:14.355 --> 29:16.022
<b>- I like the use of</b>
<b>the entrails,</b>

29:16.023 --> 29:17.791
<b> <i>all of the intestines and</i> </b>
<b> <i>everything in the bottom.</i> </b>

29:17.792 --> 29:19.359
<b> <i>You can pretty much</i> </b>
<b> <i>cover up anything</i> </b>

29:19.360 --> 29:20.660
<b>with a pile of intestines.</b>

29:20.661 --> 29:22.529
<b>First glance,</b>
<b>the tattoo's very striking.</b>

29:22.530 --> 29:24.297
<b> <i>I like the face, but man,</i> </b>

29:24.298 --> 29:25.932
<b> <i>this hair is just very weird,</i> </b>

29:25.933 --> 29:27.500
<b> <i>and it's just kind of</i> </b>
<b> <i>markered in there.</i> </b>

29:27.501 --> 29:29.002
<b> <i>If you put your hand</i> </b>
<b> <i>over the face,</i> </b>

29:29.003 --> 29:32.072
<b>and just look at the hair</b>
<b>all across the top,</b>

29:32.073 --> 29:33.940
<b> <i>how many people are gonna guess</i> </b>
<b> <i>"hair" out of that?</i> </b>

29:33.941 --> 29:35.408
<b>- It's like a sheet.</b>
<b>- I mean, I don't know.</b>

29:35.409 --> 29:38.245
<b>Why would you put your hand</b>
<b>right over the face?</b>

29:38.246 --> 29:39.946
<b> <i>- I'm looking at all of</i> </b>
<b> <i>the parts of the tattoo.</i> </b>

29:39.947 --> 29:41.948
<b> <i>Like, if you only see</i> </b>
<b> <i>that hair...</i> </b>

29:41.949 --> 29:43.984
<b>- A weird piece of cloth?</b>
<b>- That is just, like...</b>

29:43.985 --> 29:45.252
<b>- Bacon.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

29:45.253 --> 29:46.820
<b>- It's just a compromise</b>
<b>I had to make</b>

29:46.821 --> 29:48.722
<b>for the time and the style</b>
<b>that this guy wanted.</b>

29:48.723 --> 29:50.390
<b>- Every minute that</b>
<b>you were putting</b>

29:50.391 --> 29:51.825
<b>the awkward red border in</b>

29:51.826 --> 29:52.926
<b> <i>is a minute you could have been</i> </b>

29:52.927 --> 29:54.494
<b>making this hair look better.</b>

29:54.495 --> 29:56.263
<b>- The problem here is that</b>

29:56.264 --> 30:00.166
<b>it is massively unfinished.</b>

30:00.167 --> 30:03.003
<b>- Anthony.</b>

30:03.004 --> 30:05.538
<b>- This is one of the most solid</b>
<b>cover-ups of the day.</b>

30:05.539 --> 30:08.675
<b> <i>Definitely nothing of that</i> </b>
<b> <i>tattoo is coming through.</i> </b>

30:08.676 --> 30:10.043
<b> <i>Shows really good ingenuity,</i> </b>

30:10.044 --> 30:11.811
<b> <i>making that tombstone</i> </b>
<b> <i>fit just right</i> </b>

30:11.812 --> 30:14.247
<b> <i>so you could use those details</i> </b>
<b> <i>in the cracks,</i> </b>

30:14.248 --> 30:16.549
<b> <i>mask what areas you need</i> </b>
<b> <i>to really get hidden.</i> </b>

30:16.550 --> 30:18.151
<b>- You have so many nice details</b>
<b>in the hair.</b>

30:18.152 --> 30:20.620
<b> <i>You have really fine,</i> </b>
<b> <i>fine lines.</i> </b>

30:20.621 --> 30:23.189
<b> <i>You create this kind of</i> </b>
<b> <i>ratty feeling,</i> </b>

30:23.190 --> 30:25.859
<b>but it still shows perfect</b>
<b>line work in there.</b>

30:25.860 --> 30:28.495
<b>This thing really, really</b>
<b>shows strong today.</b>

30:28.496 --> 30:32.032
<b>You did a great job.</b>

30:32.033 --> 30:34.134
<b>- Christian.</b>

30:34.135 --> 30:36.436
<b> <i>- The first glance of this</i> </b>
<b> <i>tattoo is very nice.</i> </b>

30:36.437 --> 30:39.105
<b> <i>I like the aesthetic, I like</i> </b>
<b> <i>the big, simple approach.</i> </b>

30:39.106 --> 30:40.907
<b> <i>Just looking at the area</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the cover-up,</i> </b>

30:40.908 --> 30:42.676
<b> <i>the eagle worked really well.</i> </b>

30:42.677 --> 30:44.511
<b> <i>There are a few areas,</i> </b>
<b> <i>on close inspection,</i> </b>

30:44.512 --> 30:46.713
<b> <i>where you can see the old lines</i> </b>
<b> <i>popping through the white,</i> </b>

30:46.714 --> 30:48.815
<b> <i>but that's better than</i> </b>
<b> <i>just blacking it out</i> </b>

30:48.816 --> 30:50.283
<b> <i>and making it more hard to see</i> </b>

30:50.284 --> 30:51.651
<b>what's going on with the eagle.</b>

30:51.652 --> 30:53.687
<b>- You have some definite</b>
<b>challenges in the eagle.</b>

30:53.688 --> 30:55.622
<b>Things that really give</b>
<b>the eagle the power</b>

30:55.623 --> 30:56.957
<b>are gonna be the talons</b>
<b>and the head,</b>

30:56.958 --> 30:58.959
<b> <i>and you just did them too small.</i> </b>

30:58.960 --> 31:01.261
<b> <i>You want to lock 'em in and</i> </b>
<b> <i>make it powerful and strong.</i> </b>

31:01.262 --> 31:03.797
<b> <i>It gets more of a turkey feel</i> </b>
<b> <i>than it does an eagle feel.</i> </b>

31:03.798 --> 31:05.565
<b>The other thing is it's two</b>
<b>different-shaped</b>

31:05.566 --> 31:07.100
<b>wings, completely.</b>

31:07.101 --> 31:09.436
<b> <i>The one closest to us</i> </b>
<b> <i>is a big, fat square</i> </b>

31:09.437 --> 31:11.605
<b> <i>that doesn't have</i> </b>
<b> <i>that strong taper,</i> </b>

31:11.606 --> 31:13.340
<b>and then,</b>
<b>the back wing is right.</b>

31:13.341 --> 31:14.941
<b> <i>It's got that long feel.</i> </b>

31:14.942 --> 31:16.910
<b>- We've only got so much time to</b>
<b>make every line work,</b>

31:16.911 --> 31:18.878
<b>and a lot of decisions</b>
<b>I had to make on the fly</b>

31:18.879 --> 31:20.547
<b>to cover the straight lines</b>
<b>going out.</b>

31:20.548 --> 31:22.249
<b> <i>It is what it is,</i> </b>
<b> <i>but that's why I did it.</i> </b>

31:22.250 --> 31:24.884
<b>- But if you had the time to do</b>
<b>the non-important flower,</b>

31:24.885 --> 31:26.319
<b>that time could have all gone</b>

31:26.320 --> 31:27.921
<b> <i>into your main design</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the cover-up.</i> </b>

31:27.922 --> 31:29.289
<b>At this stage of the game,</b>

31:29.290 --> 31:30.624
<b>everything has to be tight,</b>

31:30.625 --> 31:32.292
<b>because you guys aren't</b>
<b>making big mistakes,</b>

31:32.293 --> 31:35.696
<b>so it's the little ones</b>
<b>that get hit.</b>

31:37.064 --> 31:38.798
<b>- All right, judges,</b>
<b>time to choose</b>

31:38.799 --> 31:40.634
<b>who had the best tattoo</b>
<b>of the day.</b>

31:40.635 --> 31:42.535
<b>- James had a vision</b>
<b>straight from the start.</b>

31:42.536 --> 31:43.970
<b> <i>Great ingenuity throughout.</i> </b>

31:43.971 --> 31:45.805
<b> <i>A lot of line work</i> </b>
<b> <i>to really help hide</i> </b>

31:45.806 --> 31:47.707
<b> <i>that old, scratchy tattoo</i> </b>
<b> <i>she had,</i> </b>

31:47.708 --> 31:50.543
<b>but for me, man, 100%</b>
<b>bulletproof cover-up?</b>

31:50.544 --> 31:52.245
<b>Anthony's tattoo gets it.</b>

31:52.246 --> 31:55.081
<b> <i>- I love the high definition</i> </b>
<b> <i>of Anthony's tattoo,</i> </b>

31:55.082 --> 31:57.851
<b> <i>but it does look</i> </b>
<b> <i>like a weird composite</i> </b>

31:57.852 --> 31:59.352
<b>that's not realized.</b>

31:59.353 --> 32:00.353
<b>- Not for me... for me,</b>

32:00.354 --> 32:01.554
<b>everything about the tattoo,</b>

32:01.555 --> 32:03.189
<b>especially the cover-up</b>
<b>area itself,</b>

32:03.190 --> 32:05.759
<b> <i>is executed so well</i> </b>
<b> <i>and so precise.</i> </b>

32:05.760 --> 32:07.460
<b>I love James' tattoo,</b>
<b>but he had some hiccups</b>

32:07.461 --> 32:09.529
<b> <i>in the line work,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and I really couldn't</i> </b>

32:09.530 --> 32:11.765
<b>pick too much apart</b>
<b>about Anthony.</b>

32:11.766 --> 32:15.101
<b>- I need a final decision.</b>

32:15.102 --> 32:16.336
<b>- Anthony.</b>

32:16.337 --> 32:20.140
<b>- My vote's for James.</b>

32:20.141 --> 32:22.008
<b>- I'm gonna vote for Anthony.</b>
<b>- [exhales]</b>

32:22.009 --> 32:23.643
<b>- The judges have decided</b>

32:23.644 --> 32:25.779
<b>that the best tattoo of the day</b>

32:25.780 --> 32:28.215
<b>goes to Anthony.</b>

32:29.917 --> 32:32.152
<b>The human canvas jury</b>
<b>is deliberating right now,</b>

32:32.153 --> 32:34.487
<b>and their vote will put</b>
<b>one artist</b>

32:34.488 --> 32:35.555
<b>up for elimination.</b>

32:35.556 --> 32:36.790
<b>Head back to the loft.</b>

32:36.791 --> 32:39.793
<b>One of you is about</b>

32:42.797 --> 32:43.930
<b> <i>♪</i> </b>

32:43.931 --> 32:45.799
<b>- Out of me, you, or Matti,</b>

32:45.800 --> 32:47.834
<b>who's going home?</b>

32:47.835 --> 32:49.402
<b>- If... if I had to pick,</b>
<b>I'd send Cleen home.</b>

32:49.403 --> 32:51.671
<b>- I think I did a big,</b>
<b>badass tattoo.</b>

32:51.672 --> 32:53.173
<b>- I don't like</b>
<b>the [bleep] tattoo.</b>

32:53.174 --> 32:55.108
<b>- That's okay, because</b>
<b>yours looks like crap.</b>

32:55.109 --> 32:57.477
<b>- You've always got something</b>
<b>to say about my tattoo,</b>

32:57.478 --> 33:00.580
<b>but no matter what, your is just</b>
<b>"a big, badass tattoo, bro."</b>

33:00.581 --> 33:03.283
<b>- At least mine covered up</b>
<b>what I was supposed to cover up.</b>

33:03.284 --> 33:05.151
<b>- I think, arguably, I had</b>
<b>one of the hardest cover-ups.</b>

33:05.152 --> 33:06.519
<b>- No way.</b>

33:06.520 --> 33:08.054
<b>- Certainly more challenging</b>
<b>than Matti's.</b>

33:08.055 --> 33:09.656
<b>Matti's was full</b>
<b>of very bad choices</b>

33:09.657 --> 33:11.024
<b>from start to finish.</b>

33:11.025 --> 33:12.759
<b>- I don't think they were</b>
<b>[bleep] bad choices.</b>

33:12.760 --> 33:14.494
<b>I still did a cool tattoo.</b>
<b>- [bleep] cool...</b>

33:14.495 --> 33:16.096
<b>- Tattoo looks cool as [bleep]</b>
<b>- Unfinished tattoo.</b>

33:16.097 --> 33:17.497
<b>- I can finish it later, dude.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

33:17.498 --> 33:19.232
<b>Finish it later when you get</b>
<b>sent home for that.</b>

33:19.233 --> 33:20.934
<b>- Dude, what am I supposed</b>
<b>to do when the guy...</b>

33:20.935 --> 33:22.335
<b>- You're supposed to finish your</b>

33:22.336 --> 33:23.970

33:23.971 --> 33:25.906
<b>- You can't use that</b>
<b>as a defense here, dude.</b>

33:25.907 --> 33:27.774
<b>- Yes, I [bleep] can.</b>
<b>- No, we do...</b>

33:27.775 --> 33:29.843
<b>we are not judged on</b>
<b>what we could do later.</b>

33:29.844 --> 33:31.278
<b>- Dude, don't tell me about</b>

33:31.279 --> 33:32.779
<b>you can say</b>
<b>when you're down there.</b>

33:32.780 --> 33:34.881

34:57.894 --> 34:59.494

35:08.371 --> 35:10.906

<b>unfinished is one thing.</b>

39:00.269 --> 39:01.637
<b>I think the bad decision</b>

39:01.638 --> 39:03.071
