00:21.040 --> 00:26.680
- This is well over 1 ,000 metres high.
- And, as pyramids go, that's... big?

00:26.840 --> 00:29.400
I know of no Goa'uld structure
of that magnitude.

00:29.560 --> 00:32.560
Definitely Mayan. This is
a major find. I have to see this.

00:32.720 --> 00:35.400
- Any signs of life?
- There is a breathable atmosphere,...

00:35.560 --> 00:37.600
..but no complex life signs.

01:07.200 --> 01:10.720
- This is a major find. I have to see this.
- You, too?

01:11.200 --> 01:13.680
Look at these readings.
Sir, these are leptons!

01:13.840 --> 01:15.560
Get out(!)

01:15.720 --> 01:19.200
Something inside this pyramid
is slowing down neutrinos.

01:19.360 --> 01:23.000
Normally neutrinos pass right through
ordinary matter, no matter how dense.

01:23.160 --> 01:26.840
Something like five hundred
million billion just passed through you.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.200
No matter how dense?

01:28.360 --> 01:32.200
A material that slows neutrinos could
change what we know about physics,...

01:32.360 --> 01:36.920
- ..the formation of the universe...
- Wait a minute, Sam. Get, uh, get closer.

01:37.080 --> 01:40.800
- The MALP's too big to cross the span.
- Then zoom in...

01:40.960 --> 01:42.880
..on that.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.320
It appears to be a human skull.

01:49.480 --> 01:52.040
- No, that's a crystal skull.
- How do you know?

01:52.160 --> 01:56.000
Because it's exactly like the one
found in 1971 in Belize...

01:56.160 --> 01:58.280
..by my grandfather.

03:09.360 --> 03:12.440
I could name a dozen crystal skulls
from around the world,...

03:12.600 --> 03:15.840
..but the skull that Nick discovered
in Belize was unique.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.800
- Nick?
- Uh, yeah... The, uh...

03:20.800 --> 03:23.840
The great explorer, the not-so-great
grandfather, Nicholas Ballard.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.280
He preferred being called Nick,
even when I was a kid. It was a...

03:27.440 --> 03:30.840
Anyway, the point is that no one
can explain how the skull...

03:31.000 --> 03:35.920
..was carved from one piece of crystal,
against the grain, given the technology.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.320
He claimed it possessed a certain...

03:38.480 --> 03:41.120
- ..power.
- What kind of power?

03:43.120 --> 03:46.200
That if one were to look
into the eyes of the skull,...

03:46.360 --> 03:49.840
..one would be teleported to see aliens.

03:53.120 --> 03:55.280
Your grandfather saw these aliens.

03:55.440 --> 03:58.400
So he insisted,
to the entire academic community.

03:59.160 --> 04:02.440
- His claim didn't go over very well?
- As you might imagine, no.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.520
He tried for years...

04:04.680 --> 04:10.760
..to make the skull teleport him again to
where the aliens lived, but he never could.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.840
Doesn't mean he wasn't right.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.720
They didn't believe you that the pyramids
were landing sites for alien spaceships.

04:17.880 --> 04:22.560
- We have to see this.
- I'll authorise a standard recon mission.

04:22.720 --> 04:26.840
Colonel, I can only guess at the effect this
type of radiation may have on humans.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.280
I recommend limited exposure -
10, 1 5 minutes at most.

04:30.440 --> 04:34.520
Wait. That's not enough time. There has
to be some sort of radiation suit or...

04:34.680 --> 04:39.000
Hey! lf you'd been listening, you'd know
that Nintendos pass through everything.

04:39.160 --> 04:41.080
I heard.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.520
Everything.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.600
(O'Neill) Whoa!

04:57.240 --> 04:59.960
(Carter) Muon radiation is increasing.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.200
- Unhealthy?
- I don't think so, sir.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.840
Not if it stays at these levels.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.840
Whoever the builders are,
they appear to be a formidable race.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.640
You could fit every pyramid on Earth
inside and still have room to spare.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.920
Yeah. Could you imagine
heatin' this place?

06:12.800 --> 06:15.080
Major, start the clock.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.600
It's identical to the one
Nick found in Belize.

06:32.760 --> 06:37.480
Can you determine if it is a means of
transport, as your grandfather believed?

06:37.640 --> 06:41.720
Uh, I can't be sure. There's no writings
of any kind on the pedestal.

06:41.880 --> 06:44.520
This cavern must act
like a containment bottle.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.480
No wonder Nick was so fascinated.

06:46.640 --> 06:50.720
A sample of what slows down neutrinos
could change the face of physics.

06:50.880 --> 06:54.920
- It's like a living thing. It's...
- Wonder how far down that is.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.280
Daniel Jackson.

07:11.080 --> 07:14.160
Sir, radiation is spiking.
It's at 300 per cent!

07:14.440 --> 07:16.360
- What?
- 400.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.880
All right, that's it! We're outta here.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.720
Daniel?

07:30.680 --> 07:32.840
Where'd he go?

07:39.640 --> 07:41.720
He seemed to disappear.

07:42.960 --> 07:46.400
These readings are off the scale now.
If we don't leave soon...

07:50.400 --> 07:52.520
Teal'c! Get outta there!

08:01.240 --> 08:04.480
- (Stargate alarm)
- Incoming traveller, sir. It's SG-1 .

08:04.640 --> 08:06.560
Open the iris!

08:16.280 --> 08:18.560
Get a medical team in here!

08:21.600 --> 08:23.520
God!

08:24.640 --> 08:27.360
Where's Dr Jackson?

08:36.559 --> 08:40.000
- (whispers) Oh, God!
- He's coming to, sir.

08:46.840 --> 08:51.040
- Carter? Daniel?
- She's still unconscious.

08:53.280 --> 08:57.320
Teal'c is better off than both of you.
His symbiote is helping him.

08:57.480 --> 09:01.520
It was close, Colonel.
If you hadn't left when you did...

09:01.680 --> 09:04.120
- Hot.
- Yes. I know.

09:04.280 --> 09:06.560
We're trying to keep
your temperature down.

09:06.720 --> 09:10.400
The muon radiation
affected your hypothalamus.

09:12.800 --> 09:15.680
Essentially your internal thermostat
went haywire.

09:15.840 --> 09:19.400
Your respiration, heartbeat
and temperature have been fluctuating.

09:19.560 --> 09:20.840
No kiddin'.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.280
As for Dr Jackson, Colonel,
he never returned with you.

09:24.440 --> 09:27.000
He is no longer there, General Hammond.

09:29.840 --> 09:32.440
The skull enveloped him
in an energy field.

09:32.600 --> 09:35.200
I fired my zat'n'ktel, but it was too late.

09:36.160 --> 09:39.040
- He seemed to disappear.
- What?!

09:58.160 --> 10:00.960
Pan the camera left again.

10:05.560 --> 10:08.920
Do the infrared sensors
detect any sign of Dr Jackson?

10:11.400 --> 10:13.320
No, sir.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.080
You should be in the infirmary.

10:16.240 --> 10:19.680
- I am well again, General Hammond.
- Not according to Dr Fraiser.

10:20.040 --> 10:23.840
Nicholas Ballard believed the crystal skull
to be a teleportation device.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.400
Recovering it may help us find
the location to which he was teleported.

10:27.560 --> 10:31.320
The MALP telemetry suggests
radiation levels are still too high.

10:31.480 --> 10:34.880
My symbiote provides
a greater tolerance against radiation.

10:35.040 --> 10:38.440
And if that thing zaps you
to wherever it sent Dr Jackson?

10:38.600 --> 10:41.880
Then I will have succeeded
in locating him.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.040
Teal'c!

11:10.880 --> 11:13.880
What happened? Where is everybody?

11:23.720 --> 11:25.960
He just ran right through me.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.520
Teal'c!

11:45.320 --> 11:47.480
What the hell is goin' on?

12:02.880 --> 12:05.920
- Hey!
- Well done, Teal'c.

12:06.840 --> 12:10.040
Regrettably, there was no sign
of Daniel Jackson.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.640
So I take it nobody else
can see me either?

12:12.800 --> 12:15.440
Doctor Rothman's
awaiting the artefact in Lab 3C.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.320
- Yes, sir.
- Major Carter will also want to study it.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.400
As soon as she's fully recovered.

12:21.760 --> 12:24.240
Recovered from what?

12:24.880 --> 12:26.840
What happened?

12:36.200 --> 12:38.200
She's going to be fine, Teal'c.

12:38.360 --> 12:42.200
Their exposure wasn't long enough
to cause any permanent damage.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.320
Doc!

12:44.480 --> 12:49.120
Protest all you want, but it'll be a while
before you get your strength back. Relax.

12:49.280 --> 12:52.200
- Oh, come on...
- Ah-ah! Doctor's orders.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.600
Napoleonic powermonger.

12:59.600 --> 13:03.040
- News?
- Daniel was nowhere near the pyramid.

13:03.760 --> 13:07.440
- What the hell happened to him?
- I do not believe the skull is a weapon.

13:07.600 --> 13:10.240
- You're right. It's not.
- If it is a teleportation device,...

13:10.400 --> 13:14.000
- ..l believe the artefact itself...
- No. Something else happened.

13:14.160 --> 13:18.920
- Doctor Rothman is now studying it.
- Rothman couldn't figure out an ashtray.

13:19.080 --> 13:22.440
The guy we need workin'
on that skull is Daniel.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.800
It is he whom we
endeavour to locate, O'Neill.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.160
Look, I'm sick of laying around.
Help me up.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.600
Dr Fraiser believes you are not
strong enough for such a mission.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.840
Yeah... whatever.

13:38.320 --> 13:41.200
Dr Fraiser is usually correct
in such matters.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.000
(groans)

13:45.960 --> 13:49.040
- (muffled) Thank you.
- You are welcome, O'Neill.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.600
OK, you can do this, Robert.
I know you can.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.760
Focus on the Mayan legends:

14:02.920 --> 14:06.440
..the lost pyramids of Belize,
the Ballard skull. That's the answer.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.880
Well, it's a crystal... skull.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.640
We knew that, Doctor.

14:13.800 --> 14:18.920
It's almost identical to the
Nicholas Ballard skull in the Smithsonian.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.200
He doesn't know it was found on P7X-377.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.920
Actually, the craftsmanship
is very impressive.

14:24.040 --> 14:26.360
It's probably made in Germany.

14:26.520 --> 14:30.960
Early 1800s... I don't understand what
it has to do with Daniel being missing.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.200
- We believe it's a teleportation device.
- Are you serious?

14:34.520 --> 14:36.480
That's good, Robert. Be sceptical.

14:36.640 --> 14:40.920
We hoped your archaeological expertise
could provide insight into where he went.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.960
- It's a skull.
- Not that sceptical.

14:44.120 --> 14:47.920
I witnessed the artefact create a
field of energy which engulfed Daniel.

14:48.080 --> 14:51.960
It's made of crystal, not plutonium.
I don't see how this could...

14:52.120 --> 14:54.800
Humour me, Doctor.

14:55.320 --> 14:58.520
- I want a full report within 1 2 hours.
- Yes, sir. I was...

14:58.680 --> 15:01.320
Do not look directly into its eyes.

15:01.720 --> 15:04.880
- OK.
- Don't let me down, Robert.

15:08.720 --> 15:11.280
Teleportation device? l...

15:12.360 --> 15:15.600
- What do you think?
- I think you're gonna get fired.

15:15.760 --> 15:16.680
Oh!

15:35.640 --> 15:37.560
Teal'c,...

15:39.520 --> 15:42.080
..in case I don't ever get the chance to...

15:42.440 --> 15:44.360
..say this,...

15:45.880 --> 15:50.800
..if you hadn't come back for me, I might
have been stuck in there for ever, so...

15:52.000 --> 15:53.920
..thank you.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.800
- Is there someone present?
- Yes!

16:04.800 --> 16:08.920
Yes, it's... it's me. It's Daniel.
I'm... I'm right here.

16:09.240 --> 16:11.160
I'm right here.

16:11.320 --> 16:16.520
Just don't walk through me.
It's... very disconcerting.

16:23.800 --> 16:27.920
You sensed I was in the room.
You just can't see or hear me.

16:29.480 --> 16:32.600
Which is a little frustrating,
as you may imagine.

16:48.680 --> 16:53.440
Stop! That is exactly what Daniel was
doing when absorbed by the energy field.

16:53.600 --> 16:58.560
- That's what I've been trying to tell him.
- I know. I was trying to prove something.

16:58.720 --> 17:00.760
- Prove what?
- That the skull didn't do this.

17:00.920 --> 17:04.200
You don't think the skull is responsible,
do you?

17:04.359 --> 17:05.280
I'm still here.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.760
There was intense muon radiation
at the time...

17:07.920 --> 17:11.760
- There's no residual radiation.
- I saw what that thing is capable of.

17:11.920 --> 17:16.119
Hey! I wish it was a teleportation device.
I could use it to go find Daniel.

17:16.280 --> 17:19.400
He's myfriend, too!
I don't think that's what we've got here.

17:19.560 --> 17:22.720
I think what we've got here is...
a paperweight.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.080
I'm sorry.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.960
That's my opinion.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.480
It's all right. I'll take over from here.

17:41.240 --> 17:45.440
There may be properties within the
structure invisible to the naked eye.

17:45.600 --> 17:50.600
- We should run diagnostic tests.
- Wait. I'm not hungry or thirsty. Why not?

17:50.760 --> 17:52.680
Thank you.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.480
Because I'm dead?

18:02.560 --> 18:05.760
- What?
- Did anybody else feel that?

18:06.440 --> 18:08.360
What?

18:09.520 --> 18:11.440
What if I'm a ghost?

18:12.840 --> 18:14.520
I just got a shiver.

18:14.680 --> 18:18.080
You're still feeling
the aftereffects of the radiation.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.520
No. I think that was me.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.880
(technician) Chevron four encoded.

18:27.800 --> 18:32.320
Sir... we've subjected the skull to every
piece of diagnostic equipment we have.

18:32.480 --> 18:35.400
- Chevron five encoded.
- What have you found out?

18:35.920 --> 18:37.480
Nothing.

18:38.760 --> 18:42.600
- We could look again at that planet.
- I'd strongly recommend against it.

18:42.760 --> 18:46.520
Periodical readings from the MALP
say radiation levels have dropped,...

18:46.680 --> 18:49.240
- ..but are still elevated.
- Chevron six encoded.

18:49.360 --> 18:52.920
We're preparing a UAV for a long-range
search around the pyramid.

18:53.080 --> 18:57.280
I don't see any point in risking another
SG team unless it finds something.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.760
(technician) Chevron seven locked.

19:04.400 --> 19:07.840
- Launch when ready, Sergeant.
- Launching UAV in five...

19:08.240 --> 19:11.120
..four... three... two... one...

19:11.400 --> 19:13.320
Mark!

19:15.600 --> 19:20.360
I can't believe I'm gonna suggest this,
but what about Daniel's grandfather?

19:20.520 --> 19:21.520
Nick?

19:21.680 --> 19:24.640
He claimed that the skull
teleported him somewhere.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.600
He may be the only person
who knows where Daniel is.

19:27.760 --> 19:31.160
I'm not so sure, Major.
I took the liberty of looking him up.

19:31.320 --> 19:32.480
Oh, you didn't!

19:32.640 --> 19:36.040
His current address is
a psychiatric institution in Oregon.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.200
Psychiatric?

19:37.360 --> 19:40.160
His failure to prove the skull
was more than a curiosity...

19:40.320 --> 19:43.760
..caused a mental breakdown
from which he's never fully recovered.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.920
- Nick checked himself in.
- Why didn't Daniel tell us that?

19:47.080 --> 19:49.760
Oh, yes. By the way, he's insane.

19:49.920 --> 19:53.760
Daniel visited until four years ago, right
before joining the Stargate programme.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.360
Oh, please! He kicked me out.
We had a huge fight.

19:56.520 --> 20:00.200
- Nick still talks about him.
- He doesn't want anything to do with me.

20:00.360 --> 20:04.760
The doctor I spoke to says any friends
of Doctor Jackson's are welcome.

20:04.920 --> 20:07.880
- What?
- We don't have much else to go on.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.920
Find out what you can.
I needn't remind you...

20:12.080 --> 20:14.560
..the details of this matter
remain classified.

20:14.720 --> 20:19.520
So you can't tell him what happened to
Dr Jackson or where the skull was found.

20:28.280 --> 20:29.920
(tannoy) ..call local 1-3.

20:30.080 --> 20:33.200
Dr Harvey, please call local 1-3.

20:37.160 --> 20:40.240
Dr Nelson, please report to ward two east.

20:40.720 --> 20:44.000
Dr Nelson, please report to ward two east.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.600
Sorry for the wait.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.280
- Is there anything I can do for you?
- Take us to Nicholas Ballard immediately.

21:05.440 --> 21:08.680
- He's just a little anxious to see old Nick.
- Are you close?

21:08.840 --> 21:11.280
- Yes.
- No.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.680
Yes. Extremely.

21:14.560 --> 21:17.160
Well, I'll check and see
if he's ready for you.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.680
What am I waiting for?

21:26.360 --> 21:28.840
(nurse) Colonel O'Neill
and his party are here.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.120
The friends of Daniel I told you about
are here - just outside.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.520
Would you like to see them now?

21:36.200 --> 21:38.280
I miss him.

21:40.720 --> 21:42.800
Hi, Nick. Long time, no see.

21:43.240 --> 21:45.800
Would you show them in, please?

21:54.520 --> 21:56.440
Nick, I need your help.

21:56.600 --> 22:00.840
Friends of mine want to ask you
about the skull you found in Belize.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.360
Tell them everything. Just trust them.

22:07.880 --> 22:11.360
Nick, this is Colonel Jack O'Neill.
He's a friend of Daniel's.

22:11.520 --> 22:14.080
Doctor, would you mind if we...?

22:16.600 --> 22:18.520
- Nick.
- Jack.

22:21.400 --> 22:24.000
O'Neill. Colonel.

22:26.360 --> 22:30.520
- Daniel followed my footsteps.
- You must be very proud.

22:31.240 --> 22:34.080
- He made a fool of himself.
- Oh, yeah. Here we go!

22:34.240 --> 22:38.360
He staked his entire academic career
on this belief that...

22:38.520 --> 22:44.240
..the great pyramids of Egypt
were made by aliens.

22:44.840 --> 22:48.360
- Yes, well, that's...
- He was more insane than I was.

22:48.520 --> 22:52.920
I told him so.
I told him to forget all that nonsense.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.280
Uh, it wasn't nonsense. I was right.

22:55.440 --> 22:58.920
He lost his apartment,
his research grant...

22:59.080 --> 23:04.200
He hasn't published a paper in two years.
Now where is he? Hm?

23:05.000 --> 23:09.080
- Where is he now?
- (Carter) That's what this is all about.

23:09.240 --> 23:14.040
We want to hear exactly what happened
to you when you first found the skull.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.520
Nothing happened.

23:18.680 --> 23:20.600
There were no aliens.

23:20.760 --> 23:23.840
- Trust them, Nick.
- No one believed me.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.200
- Daniel believed you.
- Oh, no. No, no. No, don't... Don't.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.320
He didn't.

23:30.480 --> 23:33.360
He wanted to. He did listen.

23:34.360 --> 23:39.400
In the end, he did not believe
in my theories of the skull,...

23:39.560 --> 23:44.920
..just as I did not believe his theories
of the pyramids and the aliens.

23:45.080 --> 23:47.240
I guess we both were right.

23:49.320 --> 23:54.560
Nick... can you tell us what happened
when you found that skull?

23:54.720 --> 23:56.280
Why?

23:57.680 --> 24:02.640
Because we found another skull.
Identical to the one you found in Belize.

24:05.520 --> 24:06.920
Show me.

24:07.080 --> 24:11.520
It's in a high-security facility. But if
you'd tell us about your experiences...

24:11.680 --> 24:15.120
- Then take me there.
- We can't do that. It's classified.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.200
You have to.

24:17.360 --> 24:20.280
If you don't, then I won't tell you anything.

24:26.760 --> 24:28.680
It is up to you.

24:34.920 --> 24:39.000
Colonel, there is no greater secret
in this nation than the Stargate.

24:39.160 --> 24:42.720
- So we keep him away from level 28.
- A civilian?

24:42.880 --> 24:46.840
Who spent the last 20 years
of his life in a psychiatric institution?

24:47.000 --> 24:51.120
Exactly. Who's gonna believe him
if he says anything?

24:51.280 --> 24:55.520
- Colonel, you walk a fine line.
- Thank you, sir.

24:58.400 --> 25:00.320
(phone rings)

25:01.400 --> 25:03.040
Hammond?

25:03.200 --> 25:08.000
- I know you can't hear me, but thank you.
- Absolutely. Put her through.

25:08.160 --> 25:12.680
Kayla, sweetheart, this is Grandpa.
Isn't this past your bedtime?

25:14.320 --> 25:18.920
You lost another tooth?
Well, you put it under your pillow tonight.

25:19.080 --> 25:22.720
I'll bet your big sister Tessa
wishes she lost a tooth.

25:26.280 --> 25:32.200
I'd love to come to see you in your
school play tomorrow night, but can't.

25:34.160 --> 25:37.960
Well... a very close friend of mine is lost,...

25:39.360 --> 25:41.800
..and he needs my help.

25:41.960 --> 25:44.520
Yes, he's a very close friend.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.000
I hope so, too.

26:03.880 --> 26:07.800
- You shouldn't touch that, sir.
- It's all right, Sergeant. Thank you.

26:07.960 --> 26:11.040
- Nick, this is Dr Rothman.
- It's a pleasure to meet you...

26:11.200 --> 26:17.400
It's exactly the same as the one I found
in Belize. Where did you find it?

26:17.560 --> 26:19.800
We can't tell you that.

26:20.840 --> 26:26.160
- You'll have to tell him eventually, Jack.
- The skull stood on a stone pedestal.

26:28.800 --> 26:32.080
- You have been there, haven't you?
- You mean Belize?

26:32.240 --> 26:34.440
No, no, no, no, no.

26:34.600 --> 26:38.440
That was the ruins of the temple
where I found the skull.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.960
That's all gone, collapsed.

26:43.680 --> 26:45.720
I am talking about a cavern.

26:48.320 --> 26:53.280
- Do you know the location of this cavern?
- Nowhere on this Earth.

26:53.440 --> 26:56.760
It was so enormous... that...

26:56.920 --> 26:59.840
..that the light of my torch
never reached the bottom.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.440
- Yes, but how did you get there?
- I don't know how I got there.

27:03.600 --> 27:07.680
A field of energy surrounded me,
and suddenly...

27:07.840 --> 27:10.960
..l was simply... there.

27:12.320 --> 27:15.120
- And then they came.
- "They"?

27:16.600 --> 27:18.560
The giants.

27:19.920 --> 27:22.360
- Giants?
- The giant aliens.

27:24.080 --> 27:27.680
They rose up as if
they were made of mist.

27:27.840 --> 27:30.520
They flew around me like spectres.

27:30.680 --> 27:33.400
- This is why no one believed him.
- Then they spoke.

27:33.560 --> 27:36.240
(speaks strange language)

27:38.680 --> 27:40.160
That's Mayan.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.640
(both) "The enemy of my enemy
is my friend."

27:42.800 --> 27:47.000
- Yes. But what does it mean?
- I was afraid to answer.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.200
I just closed my eyes.

27:49.360 --> 27:55.000
And suddenly I found myself back again
under the temple in Belize.

27:55.160 --> 27:58.360
And the ground was shaking,
as in an earthquake.

27:58.520 --> 28:01.400
And I just grabbed the skull and...

28:02.920 --> 28:06.000
..and climbed out
and everything collapsed.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.640
Wow! That's, uh...

28:11.960 --> 28:13.640
Giants!

28:14.360 --> 28:19.120
So, you were sent to this cavern and back
again without ever knowing where it was.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.200
And the ruins with the skull?

28:21.360 --> 28:27.280
I spent years trying to find it again,
but it was as if the temple never existed.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.520
I guess you couldn't take us there either.

28:30.680 --> 28:36.640
Can you imagine how it feels to go on
the most incredible journey of your life...

28:38.880 --> 28:41.600
..and have no one believe you?

28:48.000 --> 28:50.600
Um... Teal'c,...

28:51.240 --> 28:54.160
..you wanna escort
Nick down to the VIP room?

29:00.800 --> 29:04.000
Nicholas Ballard,
would you come with me, please?

29:12.960 --> 29:15.320
So... tell you anything?

29:16.760 --> 29:19.000
Oh. Maybe. I mean, l...

29:19.160 --> 29:21.480
Uh... no.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.120
Work on it.

29:28.080 --> 29:31.200
He described the cavern perfectly.
He had to have been there.

29:31.360 --> 29:34.000
- Uh... giants?!
- Yes, that's weird, I admit.

29:34.160 --> 29:36.440
- Somebody built that place.
- Doesn't help us.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.760
If he was transported to P7X-377,...

29:38.920 --> 29:42.360
..maybe the skull tried to send me
somewhere but was interrupted.

29:42.520 --> 29:47.000
- You get the feeling Daniel's still around?
- We have to go back there.

29:47.160 --> 29:50.320
- Kinda.
- I guess it's cos we miss him.

29:50.840 --> 29:53.560
And we have to talk to those giant aliens.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.880
Or radiation sickness.

30:00.040 --> 30:01.960
Good night, sir.

30:04.680 --> 30:08.000
What?! Wha... That's... that's it?

30:08.880 --> 30:12.000
Whatever happened
to working through the night?

30:15.360 --> 30:17.800
I'd do it for you.

30:17.960 --> 30:21.800
There will be a guard posted outside
your door if you require assistance.

30:21.960 --> 30:24.640
When you see Daniel,
would you tell him l...

30:24.800 --> 30:29.200
Oh, nev... never mind.
It's something I should tell him myself.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.280
Very well.

30:42.480 --> 30:44.600
I am sorry.

30:46.680 --> 30:48.600
For what?

30:48.760 --> 30:51.400
For not adopting you
when your parents died.

30:51.920 --> 30:54.360
You were travelling all over the world.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.360
- It wasn't your fault.
- I was eight years old. How could it be...?

30:59.520 --> 31:04.520
I am sorry for allowing
my obsession to drive me...

31:04.680 --> 31:06.840
..to madness.

31:10.280 --> 31:12.480
Would you forgive me?

31:20.680 --> 31:22.840
You can see me?

31:23.680 --> 31:28.320
- Yes, Daniel. I can see you.
- Why didn't you say something?!

31:28.480 --> 31:32.840
- You're not real, so it means nothing.
- No! No, no, no, Nick. Nick, I'm real.

31:33.000 --> 31:38.040
- I'm real. You're not hallucinating.
- Hallucinations always say that.

31:38.760 --> 31:40.880
Not this time, Nick.

31:41.040 --> 31:45.120
The skull... the skull did this to me.
I'm... I'm trapped.

31:45.280 --> 31:50.400
I'm in another dimension or out of phase -
something. All I know is I need your help.

31:50.560 --> 31:54.080
If you don't help me,
I don't know how I'm gonna get home.

31:57.360 --> 31:59.360
So what do you want me to do?

32:04.080 --> 32:08.000
Sirs, Mr Ballard insisted
on seeing both of you immediately.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.120
Forgive me.

32:10.280 --> 32:13.320
He insisted. Daniel is here.

32:15.240 --> 32:17.280
- Here?
- Repeat what I'm saying.

32:17.440 --> 32:21.280
- I'm standing right beside you.
- Standing right beside me.

32:22.160 --> 32:24.760
- He's lost a few pounds.
- Jack, don't be an ass.

32:24.920 --> 32:26.800
Jack, don't be an ass.

32:28.680 --> 32:31.080
- Daniel?
- Yes!

32:31.240 --> 32:35.080
We have to go back to the planet
and let the skull finish what it started.

32:35.240 --> 32:38.560
- We must go back to the planet.
- Planet?

32:39.520 --> 32:44.360
- Uh... not a word, sir. I swear.
- Daniel told me all about the Stargate.

32:44.520 --> 32:50.440
We must replace the skull on the pedestal
so that the giant aliens will come.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.680
Something must have
interrupted this process.

32:54.840 --> 32:59.080
Uh... Teal'c fired his zat. That's all
I can imagine it would be, sir.

32:59.360 --> 33:02.080
That's it.
That's what interrupted the process.

33:02.240 --> 33:05.520
We have to... we have to let it happen.
We have to trust it.

33:05.920 --> 33:10.680
- Why didn't you say something sooner?
- I thought l... I was hearing voices.

33:10.840 --> 33:13.440
It wouldn't have been for the first time.

33:14.360 --> 33:18.480
Forgive me, but why are you
the only person who can see him?

33:18.640 --> 33:22.720
Perhaps because I went through
the same experience.

33:24.280 --> 33:28.200
Tell Hammond if we go back now, he
may see his granddaughter's school play.

33:28.360 --> 33:34.040
General, if we go now, you may be able
to see your granddaughter's play.

33:34.920 --> 33:38.040
I was alone in my office
when Kayla phoned.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.280
Doctor Jackson,...

33:45.440 --> 33:50.680
..are you absolutely certain you and SG-1
can safely return to the planet?

33:50.840 --> 33:53.440
- Say yes.
- Yes.

33:56.800 --> 33:59.040
That's good enough for me, sir.

34:01.840 --> 34:06.440
So it wasn't the skull alone that did this.
It was its connection to the cavern?

34:06.600 --> 34:09.600
Yes. I think the skull
just represents the human form.

34:09.760 --> 34:11.199
Yes.

34:11.360 --> 34:13.600
Daniel said you should come
to make it work?

34:13.760 --> 34:16.600
Wait. I never said that.
You're taking advantage of me.

34:16.760 --> 34:18.679
Yes.

34:33.360 --> 34:36.840
So this is what you have been doing
these past few years?

34:37.000 --> 34:38.760
Exploring planets.

34:38.920 --> 34:42.000
SG-1 , you have a go.
Maintain radio contact.

34:45.920 --> 34:48.719
Then, behind that,...

34:49.679 --> 34:52.040
..there is another world?

34:52.199 --> 34:54.480
You must tell me everything.

34:55.280 --> 34:57.280
As soon as we get back, I promise.

34:58.840 --> 35:01.000
After you, Nicholas Ballard.

35:39.480 --> 35:41.800
It's just as I remembered it!

35:43.680 --> 35:45.800
This is where they live!

36:49.880 --> 36:52.760
Now we must wait for the giant aliens.

36:53.760 --> 36:56.080
That just has a nice ring to it.

37:04.040 --> 37:08.280
- General Hammond, we're in position.
- Understood, Colonel. Proceed.

37:27.480 --> 37:31.240
- Sir, radiation's climbing again.
- This is incredible!

37:31.400 --> 37:33.520
Daniel said to let it happen.

37:48.920 --> 37:50.840
Daniel!

37:51.760 --> 37:53.960
Sam.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.760
- It worked!
- O'Neill?

38:04.600 --> 38:06.520
Major Carter?

38:09.680 --> 38:11.000
Carter?

38:11.160 --> 38:14.240
It appears we're out of phase
like Daniel, but Teal'c isn't.

38:14.400 --> 38:17.240
- Why?
- You're asking me?

38:18.920 --> 38:20.960
General Hammond,...

38:22.000 --> 38:25.680
- ..l was not teleported with the others.
- Return to base immediately.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.920
(rumbling)

38:48.440 --> 38:51.440
Holy smoke! Bullwinkle!

38:56.560 --> 38:58.480
Hello!

38:59.080 --> 39:02.760
- What's your name?
- (distorted) Quetlzelcoatl.

39:02.920 --> 39:05.720
(speaks Mayan)

39:07.680 --> 39:10.960
- Daniel?
- "The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

39:11.120 --> 39:14.600
I know what it's saying.
Why is it saying that?

39:14.760 --> 39:17.120
It didn't affect Teal'c. Why?

39:17.280 --> 39:19.520
Because he's Jaffa.

39:19.680 --> 39:22.600
He's carrying a symbiote. The Goa'uld.

39:24.800 --> 39:27.520
We are enemies of the Goa'uld!

39:28.000 --> 39:29.920
Then you are welcome here.

39:30.080 --> 39:32.800
- Keep talking.
- We're... we're travellers.

39:32.960 --> 39:35.600
We come in search of friendship.

39:35.760 --> 39:38.880
We'd like to exchange
our knowledge and culture.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.200
We accept your proposition.

39:44.680 --> 39:47.920
- You may remain.
- Me?

39:48.720 --> 39:49.960
Him?

39:50.120 --> 39:54.400
- This is not your first time here.
- You remember!

39:54.560 --> 39:57.960
There are others among our people
who would gladly return.

39:58.120 --> 40:00.680
No, Daniel. Let me.

40:00.800 --> 40:03.840
- Nick...
- This was my life's work.

40:04.000 --> 40:09.200
I've been hoping for another chance
at this for 29 years!

40:11.440 --> 40:15.160
- Please?
- You just came back into my life.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.560
I'll be back again.

40:19.160 --> 40:20.600
Please.

40:21.280 --> 40:23.720
Look again into the eyes of the skull.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.840
Well, Nick,...

40:32.080 --> 40:35.200
- ..take notes.
- I will.

40:43.280 --> 40:45.520
You have to tell me everything.

40:45.840 --> 40:47.760
I promise.

40:48.960 --> 40:50.640
Daniel,...

40:52.760 --> 40:54.880
..l am proud of you.

40:57.920 --> 40:59.840
Goodbye,...

41:02.000 --> 41:03.960
..Grandpa.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.280
