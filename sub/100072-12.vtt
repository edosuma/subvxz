if she finds out.

09:53.924 --> 09:56.627
That’s why Lois
isn’t going to find out.

09:56.627 --> 09:58.231
Right, boy?

09:58.231 --> 09:59.297
What are you talking about?

09:59.297 --> 10:00.924
I’m talking about you...

10:00.924 --> 10:03.627
not being... a bad boy.

10:03.627 --> 10:06.132
I’m-I’m not...
I’m not a bad boy.

10:06.132 --> 10:08.264
Then do not say anything
to Lois.

10:08.264 --> 10:09.627
You hear me?
Bad.

10:09.627 --> 10:11.099
Bad dog.

10:11.099 --> 10:12.693
So, we understand each other?

10:12.693 --> 10:14.429
Yeah, I’ll be good.
Trust me.

10:14.429 --> 10:16.693
I saw what you did
to that black belt.

10:18.495 --> 10:20.759
-(crowd gasps)
-I don’t care what color
your belt is,

10:20.759 --> 10:22.924
you’re a child
and I am stronger than you.

10:22.924 --> 10:25.099
-(crowd booing)
-Oh, boo yourself.

10:25.099 --> 10:27.561
Boo yourself. She was the one
strutting around Pizza Hut

10:27.561 --> 10:29.000
with that trophy.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.429
Yeah, who’s the Girls’ Regional
Youth Karate Champ now, Kelsey?

10:32.429 --> 10:33.627
Huh?

10:33.627 --> 10:36.231
Kelsey?

10:57.858 --> 10:59.264
All right, down in the tunnel.

10:59.264 --> 11:02.495
Time to way-too-easily
make a torch.

11:06.528 --> 11:08.330
Look, our Internet connection.

11:08.330 --> 11:09.825
CHRIS:
Mom!

11:09.825 --> 11:11.033
Never mind.

11:11.033 --> 11:12.660
Mom!

11:12.660 --> 11:14.198
Never mind.

11:14.198 --> 11:15.858
CLEVELAND:
Donna!

11:15.858 --> 11:17.231
JOE:
Bonnie!

11:19.099 --> 11:20.396
QUAGMIRE:
I’m not on the Internet.

11:20.396 --> 11:23.132
Some people
in this neighborhood read.

11:26.891 --> 11:29.165
Anyway, it was
a beautiful ceremony.

11:29.165 --> 11:31.891
We laid my Uncle Reggie to rest
with the respect

11:31.891 --> 11:33.561
that he deserved.

11:33.561 --> 11:34.957
Aah!
Uncle Reggie!

11:34.957 --> 11:37.231
I’m sorry we stuffed you
in that Hefty Cinch Sak

11:37.231 --> 11:38.726
and pushed you in the pond.

11:38.726 --> 11:40.396
Relax, guys.
It’s just me.

11:40.396 --> 11:42.561
You dug a hole all the way
from your house?

11:42.561 --> 11:43.891
Pretty cool, huh?

11:43.891 --> 11:46.198
Yeah, but what if Lois
notices you’re gone?

11:46.198 --> 11:47.792
Trust me, I got it covered.

11:49.165 --> 11:52.066
Peter, there’s some salmon
on the stove if you’re hungry.

11:53.363 --> 11:55.891
Well, it’s what I made.

11:55.891 --> 11:57.429
So, you guys want
to see the tunnel?

11:57.429 --> 11:59.561
-Frick yeah.
-Let’s go!
-Right behind you.

11:59.561 --> 12:01.627
How ’bout you, Jerome?
You in?

12:02.561 --> 12:05.396
Okay, well, he’s busy.

12:05.396 --> 12:07.099
Peter Griffin...

12:07.099 --> 12:09.759
(dramatically):
you’ve been a busy boy.

12:09.759 --> 12:12.000
-What was that?
-Just a cool way
to say something.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.726
It wasn’t that cool.

12:13.726 --> 12:15.000
All right,
it’s pretty neat, Peter,

12:15.000 --> 12:16.561
but we should probably
get out of here.

12:16.561 --> 12:17.693
Yeah, sure.

12:17.693 --> 12:19.759
Unless anyone wants
to see a salamander.

12:19.759 --> 12:21.099
Oh, look at it.

12:21.099 --> 12:22.231
I named him Sally.

12:22.231 --> 12:23.825
Slippy-ass little bug
right there.

12:23.825 --> 12:25.363
Okay, this is pretty cool.

12:25.363 --> 12:27.660
Come on, I’ll show you the rest.

12:30.297 --> 12:31.297
Look at these handprints.

12:31.297 --> 12:33.528
Somebody did
the perfect cartwheel.

12:33.528 --> 12:35.396
Actually, Peter,
there’s elbow prints

12:35.396 --> 12:37.462
and knee prints
all around this thing.

12:37.462 --> 12:39.264
The perfect cartwheel.

12:39.264 --> 12:41.726
And there’s scuffled dirt and
a little bit of blood over here.

12:41.726 --> 12:44.297
Perhaps the ancients
cartwheeled everywhere.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.726
Peter, did you trip on a root
and eat it big-time?

12:46.726 --> 12:48.066
No, I did not.

12:48.066 --> 12:50.594
Uh, hang on. There’s a guy
tunneling the other way.

12:50.594 --> 12:52.066
Pretty cramped, huh?

12:52.066 --> 12:53.594
(chuckles)
You said it.

12:53.594 --> 12:55.594
Next time,
I pay for business class.

12:55.594 --> 12:57.198
(chuckles)
Right?

12:57.198 --> 12:59.363
That guy was in the paper
for hitting his wife.

12:59.363 --> 13:01.825
(rumbling)

13:01.825 --> 13:05.396
Peter, are you sure this tunnel
is structurally sound?

13:05.396 --> 13:08.231
Don’t worry, guys.
I’ll cartwheel back for help.

13:08.231 --> 13:09.660
Aah!
(groans)

13:09.660 --> 13:10.759
A root.

13:10.759 --> 13:12.429
(groans)
I ate it big-time.

13:12.429 --> 13:14.693
-(rumbling)
-Look out!

13:24.165 --> 13:25.495
Oh, my God.

13:25.495 --> 13:27.825
The tunnel’s completely
collapsed on both sides.

13:27.825 --> 13:29.825
Oh, no.
We’re stuck down here.

13:29.825 --> 13:31.165
BEAVER:
Hey, guys.

13:31.165 --> 13:33.033
Hey, look,
it’s the dumb beaver.

13:33.033 --> 13:34.330
You live down here?

13:34.330 --> 13:35.495
Sure do.

13:35.495 --> 13:38.627
Welcome to
my running-out-of-Airbnb.

13:38.627 --> 13:39.627
(giggles)

13:39.627 --> 13:42.000
No, but this is very serious.

13:50.594 --> 13:52.858
Great.
Peter, this is just great.

13:52.858 --> 13:55.858
Because you can’t stand up
to your wife, I’m gonna die.

13:55.858 --> 13:57.858
Relax, Quagmire.
Nobody’s gonna die.

13:57.858 --> 14:00.462
What do you think happens
when we run out of air, genius?

14:00.462 --> 14:02.033
Air. Right.

14:02.033 --> 14:03.924
You know, I’d only taken
the other three elements

14:03.924 --> 14:05.033
into account.

14:05.033 --> 14:08.297
Earth, wind, fire, water.

14:08.297 --> 14:09.561
Where’s air?

14:09.561 --> 14:11.231
Wind is air.

14:11.231 --> 14:15.066
Who’s that, Joey Swanson
or Bill Nye the Science Guy?

14:15.066 --> 14:16.396
Peter, can’t you dig us
out of here?

14:16.396 --> 14:18.132
No, I left my tools at The Clam.

14:18.132 --> 14:19.660
Uh, what’s standard protocol

14:19.660 --> 14:21.330
for when the cops
start looking for us?

14:21.330 --> 14:22.792
Uh, I’m not sure.

14:22.792 --> 14:25.297
I just give out stickers
if kids come to the station.

14:25.297 --> 14:26.891
I guess the only chance we have

14:26.891 --> 14:28.726
is if Brian sells me out
to Lois.

14:28.726 --> 14:32.033
What I wouldn’t give to be
with a woman just one more time.

14:32.033 --> 14:34.726
You can go over to that wall,
make yourself a dirt-gina.

14:34.726 --> 14:36.627
-This wall here?
-No, silly.

14:36.627 --> 14:38.033
That wall’s a guy.

14:38.033 --> 14:40.792
(all laughing)

14:44.264 --> 14:46.198
<i>TV ANNOUNCER:

<i>Wow, what are those? Sharks?</i>

15:07.264 --> 15:10.495
<i>We’ve, uh, probably got
a commercial break coming up.</i>

15:10.495 --> 15:12.528

Oh, really?</i>

15:12.528 --> 15:14.528
<i>Four hours, no commercials?</i>

15:14.528 --> 15:16.957

15:16.957 --> 15:19.528
<i>Some penguins over there.</i>

15:19.528 --> 15:21.528
Brian, have you seen Peter?

15:21.528 --> 15:23.132
N-No. Why?

15:23.132 --> 15:25.066
Well, I haven’t seen him
all morning.

15:25.066 --> 15:26.462
I’m worried he left the house

15:26.462 --> 15:27.957
and got into some kind
of trouble.

15:27.957 --> 15:30.627
He’ll turn up.
I’m sure he’s fine.

15:30.627 --> 15:32.132
Phew.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.627
Somethin’ on your mind there,
bud?

15:33.627 --> 15:34.792
I’m not a bad boy.

15:34.792 --> 15:36.264
Uh, nobody said you were.

15:36.264 --> 15:37.759
Good.
Because I’m not a bad boy.

15:37.759 --> 15:39.198
I’m a good boy.

15:39.198 --> 15:41.462
How would you like to be
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hgood boy?

15:41.462 --> 15:42.726
Tell me how.
Tell me how.

15:42.726 --> 15:43.726
Where’s the fat man?

15:43.726 --> 15:44.792
Aw, damn it.

15:44.792 --> 15:46.231
But I promised Peter.

15:46.231 --> 15:48.099
What is it?
What is it, boy?

15:48.099 --> 15:50.759
(barking)

15:50.759 --> 15:52.957
The fat man dug a tunnel
to go hang out

15:52.957 --> 15:54.429
with Cleveland,
Joe and Quagmire?

15:54.429 --> 15:56.132
We’ve got to tell someone.

15:56.132 --> 15:57.165
What is it, Stewie?

15:57.165 --> 15:59.330
(crying)

15:59.330 --> 16:01.594
Daddy went
to a Peter Cetera concert

16:01.594 --> 16:04.066
in Cleveland with Robin Tunney?

16:04.066 --> 16:05.726

16:12.231 --> 16:13.825
Don’t-don’t do that, Mila.

16:13.825 --> 16:16.165
Not-not on this show.

16:18.660 --> 16:20.693
<i>Good afternoon. I’m Tom Tucker,
here with a story</i>

16:20.693 --> 16:23.033

16:44.165 --> 16:46.099
Anyone else
having trouble breathing?

16:46.099 --> 16:47.198
Could just be allergies.

16:47.198 --> 16:48.759
Yeah.
Yeah, you think it’s allergies?

16:48.759 --> 16:50.825
You don’t think it’s because
we’re running out of air?

16:50.825 --> 16:52.033
It’s hard to say.

16:52.033 --> 16:53.825
I don’t know
how severe your allergies are.

16:53.825 --> 16:55.363
-Different people are allergic
to different things.
-You are such a moron.

16:55.363 --> 16:57.231
-You know,
I hope we do die down here.
-Oh, that’s nice.

16:57.231 --> 16:59.066
-So I never have to listen to
another word out of your mouth.
-That’s a nice thing

16:59.066 --> 17:00.330
-to say to a lifelong friend.
-(sneezes)

17:00.330 --> 17:01.858
Ah. Ah.

17:01.858 --> 17:03.132
I’m gonna kill you, Peter!

17:03.132 --> 17:04.561
-(grunting)
-All right, calm down.

17:04.561 --> 17:07.429
Let’s not use the rest of
our oxygen to kill each other.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.231
So if we’re all
gonna die anyway,

17:10.231 --> 17:13.495
what’s the worst thing
you guys have ever done?

17:13.495 --> 17:15.396
Okay, I’ll go first.

17:15.396 --> 17:16.726
Lois...

17:16.726 --> 17:18.165
once killed a woman.

17:18.165 --> 17:19.825
Seems like a secret about Lois.

17:19.825 --> 17:22.297
Yeah.
\h\h\h\h\h\hpicked out the woman.

17:22.297 --> 17:25.924
Well, I, uh... I, uh, went
to a Coldplay concert by myself.

17:25.924 --> 17:27.264
What?
That’s terrible.

17:27.264 --> 17:29.528
-Why would you do that?
-I like Coldplay!

17:29.528 --> 17:31.660
They were playing in Boston,
so I made the trip.

17:31.660 --> 17:34.099
Great show, I got to say.
Very visual.

17:34.099 --> 17:36.231
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hvisual.
I was at that show, too.

17:36.231 --> 17:38.033
What?
You were there?

17:38.033 --> 17:39.594
No, I’m just kidding.

17:39.594 --> 17:40.693
(all laughing)

17:40.693 --> 17:42.759
Uh, I like Lil Yachty, man.

17:42.759 --> 17:44.726
I don’t know nothin’
about that mess.

17:44.726 --> 17:46.264
<i>But I did go to that show.</i>

17:46.264 --> 17:47.594
<i>Didn’t mean to.</i>

17:47.594 --> 17:49.396
<i>I said "Kid ’n Play"
on the phone,</i>

17:49.396 --> 17:52.066
<i>but they didn’t understand me,
so I got Coldplay.</i>

17:52.066 --> 17:54.561
<i>One other time
I said "Kid ’n Play"</i>

17:54.561 --> 17:56.363
<i>and I got Cirque du Soleil.</i>

17:56.363 --> 18:00.924
<i>I’m thinking maybe Kid ’n Play
doesn’t perform anymore.</i>

18:01.957 --> 18:03.297
(rumbling)

18:03.297 --> 18:04.957
What’s that sound?

18:04.957 --> 18:06.759
Probably just the movie
in the next theater.

18:06.759 --> 18:09.825
I hope the rest of the tunnel
isn’t about to collapse.

18:12.858 --> 18:15.792
