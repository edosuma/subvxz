Previously on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop"...

00:04.437 --> 00:07.707
{\an8}(reporter)
Rapper Juelz Santana is
accused of trying to sneak

00:07.774 --> 00:10.777
{\an8}a loaded gun through
the Newark Liberty Airport.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.113
{\an8}I had a lot of teeth problems
and I was, you know,

00:13.179 --> 00:15.315
{\an8}prescribed Percocets
from the doctor.

00:15.382 --> 00:16.683
{\an8}I started abusing that.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.052
{\an8}I really sat there
and watched you

00:19.119 --> 00:23.056
{\an8}dig yourself into a hole
and I couldn't do nothing.

00:23.123 --> 00:25.959
{\an8}What's going on?

00:23.123 --> 00:25.959
{\an8}That was the lawyer.

00:26.025 --> 00:28.027
{\an8}He was telling me
for a plea deal,

00:28.094 --> 00:30.797
{\an8}it could be anywhere
from 18 to 24 months.

00:30.864 --> 00:35.034
{\an8}If we go to trial,
it would be more
like five years.

00:37.170 --> 00:39.005
{\an8}I didn't get an invite to
Jonathan's birthday party.

00:39.072 --> 00:41.107
{\an7}You're definitely invited.
For sure.

00:41.174 --> 00:42.509
{\an8}Juju is fake, honey.

00:42.575 --> 00:44.310
{\an8}Juju is as fake, honey,
as a $2 bill.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.045
{\an8}You hear me?

00:44.377 --> 00:46.045
{\an7}Huh...

00:46.112 --> 00:49.048
{\an7}He threw some words around
that I didn't like.

00:49.115 --> 00:51.084
{\an8}What words around?

00:49.115 --> 00:51.084
{\an8}Talk about you're fake.

00:51.151 --> 00:52.685
{\an8}Me? I'm fake?

00:52.752 --> 00:54.320
{\an8}I came to celebrate you.

00:54.387 --> 00:55.922
{\an8}Although I had to hear
from somebody else

00:55.989 --> 00:57.457
{\an8}that you have
a problem with me.

00:57.524 --> 00:59.125
{\an7}It was the secretive stuff,
which she agreed on.

00:59.192 --> 01:00.560
{\an8}So y'all have a problem
with me being secretive?

01:00.627 --> 01:02.829
{\an8}No, no, no, no! That's not
what the (bleep) I said!

01:02.896 --> 01:04.631
{\an8}Can you guys don't
do this right now?

01:04.697 --> 01:06.266
{\an8}Don't lose
your class, Juju!

01:06.332 --> 01:08.001
{\an7}Yo, this bitch
I'm about to (bleep) up.

01:08.067 --> 01:11.004
♪♪

01:36.095 --> 01:38.898
♪♪

01:39.966 --> 01:41.768
{\an8}How you feeling?

01:39.966 --> 01:41.768
{\an7}Good.

01:41.835 --> 01:44.370
{\an8}And yourself?

01:41.835 --> 01:44.370
{\an8}It's going good.

01:44.437 --> 01:47.807
{\an8}I was shocked to see Juju
storm out of Jonathan's
party like that.

01:47.874 --> 01:51.377
She barely even spoke,
and Juju rarely gets heated.

01:51.444 --> 01:54.514
And before I could even
find out what happened,

01:54.581 --> 01:57.684
I got sidetracked by Kimbella's
trifecta of buffoonery.

01:57.750 --> 02:00.553
So Juju and I definitely
need a catch up.

02:00.620 --> 02:04.691
{\an1}So talk to me, because
the last time I saw you,

02:04.757 --> 02:07.393
{\an8}you just stormed out.

02:04.757 --> 02:07.393
{\an8}I stormed out, Yandy,

02:07.460 --> 02:09.395
{\an8}because it was
a total (bleep) up.

02:09.461 --> 02:11.764
{\an5}When we saw each
other, you were like,
oh, Jonathan's party.

02:11.831 --> 02:12.932
I'm like, oh, I
didn't get an invite,

02:12.999 --> 02:14.367
but I didn't think
nothing of it.

02:14.434 --> 02:17.403
{\an5}I go to his party,
I'm like, hey, papi,
happy birthday.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.439
{\an5}I'm here
to celebrate you.
I heard you got

02:19.506 --> 02:21.374
{\an5}a problem with me,
but we'll talk
about it later.

02:21.441 --> 02:25.378
{\an5}Girl, out the side,
his wackadoodle friend
Anais comes, jumps in.

02:25.445 --> 02:28.047
{\an5}This is not the
time or the place.
This is not--

02:28.114 --> 02:29.282
I'm like, this is
a total ambush,

02:29.349 --> 02:30.483
and I'm looking at
everybody sideways.

02:30.550 --> 02:32.252
Jonathan said,
you're secretive.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.953
I don't like the word
"secretive."

02:34.020 --> 02:36.623
{\an5}I feel like it's
associated with sneaky.
I don't like it.

02:36.689 --> 02:38.491
Like, why is this even
a topic of conversation?

02:38.558 --> 02:41.694
{\an4}The thing about that
is, I mean, you be
leaving stuff out.

02:41.761 --> 02:43.596
{\an5}Like what? Let's
talk about it?
What? Like what?

02:43.663 --> 02:44.931
Well, we could talk
about the breakup.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.867
Last year, Juju
and her man broke up

02:47.934 --> 02:51.471
and she didn't tell any
of us 'til months later.

02:51.538 --> 02:54.908
{\an5}You're secretive because
you're keeping your
feelings to yourself.

02:54.974 --> 02:56.910
You're keeping your
intentions to yourself.

02:56.976 --> 02:59.979
{\an5}You're not disclosing
information that
friends should disclose.

03:00.046 --> 03:02.682
{\an5}The breakup was something
that was a major hardship
in my life.

03:02.749 --> 03:05.084
{\an4}Yeah.

03:02.749 --> 03:05.084
I was with Cam
over ten years.

03:05.151 --> 03:07.754
{\an5}We broke up. I had
to deal with it
on my own.

03:07.820 --> 03:10.456
{\an5}I don't know if you
understand the...

03:07.820 --> 03:10.456
Of course I do.

03:10.523 --> 03:13.092
{\an5}So why even take that
particular situation
and be, like, oh,

03:13.159 --> 03:15.962
{\an5}you're secretive? Oh,
why you didn't tell us?
I didn't feel like it.

03:16.029 --> 03:21.701
{\an5}I gave ten years and put my
heart into a relationship
for it to fall apart,

03:21.768 --> 03:24.237
and it took a lot for me
to pick myself up

03:24.304 --> 03:26.506
and find the strength
to move on.

03:26.573 --> 03:29.208
And, yes, I took my time,
and I was private about it.

03:29.275 --> 03:33.746
{\an4}Me and Cam, we decided to
call off our engagement.
We broke up.

03:33.813 --> 03:35.315
How long has this been?

03:35.381 --> 03:39.018
When I finally decide to open up
to my friends, the first thing

03:39.085 --> 03:42.088
I hear out of Yandy's mouth is,
how long has it been?

03:42.155 --> 03:43.890
That's your first thought?

03:43.957 --> 03:46.593
{\an5}Don't question me why
I'm secretive or why
I didn't say anything.

03:46.659 --> 03:49.195
{\an1}My very next question, Juju,
was, do you need anything?

03:49.262 --> 03:52.732
{\an5}And if I want to feel like,
damn, I wish I could have
been there for you sooner,

03:52.799 --> 03:56.369
{\an4}let me feel like that.
Don't make me feel bad 'cause
that's the type of friend...

03:56.436 --> 03:59.272
{\an5}Well, don't make me feel bad
because it's my breakup
and I want to talk about it

03:59.339 --> 04:00.673
{\an1}when I want to talk about it,
when I'm ready.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.176
Like...

04:00.740 --> 04:03.176
{\an1}Of course.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.089
{\an1}Happy to see you, Rich.
I'm telling you, brother man.

04:17.156 --> 04:21.094
{\an8}You know me. I'm always on
my grind, still doing the
music management thing,

04:21.160 --> 04:25.198
{\an5}so today I'm out here at an
industry networking event
with my homie Jaquae.

04:25.264 --> 04:26.633
{\an5}What's the word?

04:25.264 --> 04:26.633

We're gonna perform our new
single "Move It" together.

Come on, bro.

04:39.412 --> 04:41.547
I ain't a hater,

04:41.614 --> 04:44.217
{\an5}but you know I got
history with shawty.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.217
Yeah, I know.

04:44.283 --> 04:47.820
Nya Lee has rubbed me
the wrong way since day one.

04:47.887 --> 04:52.025
{\an5}You come in my (bleep) set
with the glasses on and,
"I'm Richie Dollaz."

04:52.091 --> 04:54.827
{\an5}I am Richie Dollaz.

04:52.091 --> 04:54.827
And I think you're
a cornball. That's it.

04:54.894 --> 04:56.796
I just looked at her
as some pop-up queen

04:56.863 --> 04:59.899
{\an5}who didn't even value
her own career, and I
guess I was right,

04:59.966 --> 05:02.335
because where
has she been since?

05:02.402 --> 05:06.305
{\an4}You know, everybody always
see Nya as an aggressive
person, but deep inside...

05:06.372 --> 05:08.841
{\an5}She was absolutely
the aggressive person.

05:06.372 --> 05:08.841
Yeah, I know.

05:08.908 --> 05:11.344
{\an1}But she's slowed down
since she became a mom.

05:11.411 --> 05:14.914
{\an1}She really focused and ever
since I jumped on the record,

05:14.981 --> 05:17.116
{\an1}she been getting
a lot of recognition.

05:17.183 --> 05:19.419
{\an5}She could be
a different person.
I'm a different person.

05:19.485 --> 05:20.753
We all grow.

05:19.485 --> 05:20.753
We all grow.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.022
{\an4}Okay?

05:20.820 --> 05:23.022

no hate towards her.

Yes. Thank you.

being said...

05:26.826 --> 05:29.729

she's a rapper.

05:34.467 --> 05:37.036
{\an1}Okay.

05:37.103 --> 05:38.871
She got a lot
of social media.

05:38.938 --> 05:40.773
She got
a built-in fan base.

05:40.840 --> 05:44.410
{\an5}She got a big following,

there's some money there.

{\an8}(Jonathan)
Kimbella and Anais completely
destroyed my birthday with
their ridiculous outburst,

06:14.140 --> 06:17.143
{\an8}and it just turned into
the biggest (bleep) show
that ever was.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.346
So today, I invited Kimbella,
Cyn, and Anais out for drinks

06:20.413 --> 06:22.648
because I want to clear the air
and more than anything,

06:22.715 --> 06:25.618
I definitely want an apology
from Kim and Anais.

06:25.685 --> 06:27.653
Hello.

06:25.685 --> 06:27.653
{\an1}Hey, boo.

06:29.155 --> 06:33.292
{\an8}Joey and I are back from
our romantic getaway in Cabo.

06:33.359 --> 06:36.829
{\an5}Yeah, my baby's so hot.

06:33.359 --> 06:36.829
I love everything about you.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.064
Oh, baby, I love you.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.799
{\an3}I love you.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.799
Give me a kiss.

06:39.866 --> 06:43.936
The trip wasn't as sextacular
as I was hoping it would be.

06:44.003 --> 06:45.605
He just wanted to sleep.

06:45.671 --> 06:48.641
It seems like Joey doesn't
really get how important it is

06:48.708 --> 06:51.744
for my emotional wellbeing
to feel wanted

06:51.811 --> 06:54.113
and to feel loved by my man.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.615
{\an5}What you been up to?

06:54.180 --> 06:55.615
Oh, my God.

06:55.681 --> 06:57.650
{\an5}Cabo was amazing.

06:55.681 --> 06:57.650
You got to (bleep)?

06:57.717 --> 07:01.954

So, no.

{\an3}Hey, bitch.

Hi, Anais. How are you?
How you doing?

07:23.709 --> 07:27.480
{\an5}I want us all to talk,
'cause what I don't want
to continue to happen for me

07:27.547 --> 07:31.317
{\an5}is conflict and drama with
women, especially women
who I consider my friends.

07:31.384 --> 07:35.822
My birthday was a (bleep) show.
You completely ambushed Juju

07:35.888 --> 07:38.124
and it came completely
out of left field.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.159
The minute Juju walked
through the (bleep) door,

07:40.226 --> 07:42.094
if you had an issue with her,
you should have did

07:42.161 --> 07:44.063
what you ended up doing,
which was leaving.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.866
{\an5}You should have let me handle
my issue with Juju.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.866
{\an3}And I did.

07:46.933 --> 07:52.572
{\an5}No, you did not. It just
feels ambushed, bitch!
You are my sister!

07:52.638 --> 07:54.974
Jonathan was the one that
decided to hash things out

07:55.041 --> 07:57.009
with Juju at
his own birthday party.

07:57.076 --> 08:00.179
{\an5}She started it,
he had to finish it.
It was his fault.

08:00.246 --> 08:04.784
{\an4}I thought I was defending
you by attacking Juju.

08:00.246 --> 08:04.784
How was you defending me? How?

08:04.851 --> 08:06.886
{\an5}Juju wasn't attacking me.
The only person who
attacked me was her.

08:06.953 --> 08:10.523
{\an4}Hold on, hold on.
Not no attack.
I felt I was ambushed

08:10.590 --> 08:13.559
{\an4}by being thrown into
whatever beef you
and Juju had,

08:13.626 --> 08:15.728
{\an4}y'all should have
discussed that prior

that's not trans say "trans"?
Or that's offensive?

17:27.311 --> 17:30.416

24:27.132 --> 24:32.337
{\an8}whether I want to enter a guilty
plea or take this case to trial.

24:32.404 --> 24:35.373
{\an8}Originally, my lawyer
gave me a rough estimate

24:35.440 --> 24:38.443
{\an8}of what he thought
the outcome of the situation,

24:38.510 --> 24:40.478
{\an8}but now it's panning out
to be a little bit different.

24:40.545 --> 24:44.683
{\an7}What's up?

24:40.545 --> 24:44.683
{\an8}Just happy to see you.

24:44.749 --> 24:48.687
You know, we still gotta
talk about, you know,

24:48.753 --> 24:50.522
everything that
happened with Brian.

24:50.589 --> 24:55.694
At first he thought
between 18 and 24 months,

24:55.760 --> 25:00.432
{\an5}but now he's saying
it could be potentially
27 to 37 months

25:00.498 --> 25:05.871
{\an5}and that's with a plea,
and if we go to trial
and get a guilty verdict,

25:05.937 --> 25:09.608
the time would be
47 to 57 months.

25:09.674 --> 25:14.613
{\an5}(Kimbella)
This is double the time that
I thought we were looking at,

25:14.679 --> 25:18.049
{\an5}and I wasn't even
comfortable with Juelz
going away for any time,

25:18.116 --> 25:23.521
{\an5}and I'm just so (bleep)
furious that this is
happening to my family.

25:23.588 --> 25:26.157
{\an4}Bella could be ten
when you get out
of jail, you know?

25:26.224 --> 25:29.694
{\an1}Juelz could be 11 or 12
when you get out of jail.

25:29.761 --> 25:33.365
These are things that
run through my mind.

25:33.431 --> 25:36.368
{\an5}So you don't think they
run through my mind?

25:33.431 --> 25:36.368
I don't know.

25:36.434 --> 25:41.239
{\an4}This is you not being
able to see your family
for up to four years.

25:41.306 --> 25:44.576
{\an4}Are you okay with that?
That's all I'm asking you.

25:41.306 --> 25:44.576
No, I'm not okay with that.

25:44.643 --> 25:48.146
{\an1}What are you gonna decide
to do at the end of the day?

25:48.213 --> 25:50.548
Are you gonna take a plea?
Are you gonna go to trial?

25:50.615 --> 25:53.251
{\an1}What do you even think
that you're going to do?

25:53.318 --> 25:55.854
{\an5}I don't know what I'm
gonna do. I'm still
trying to figure it out.

25:55.921 --> 25:59.925
{\an5}I'm still debating.

25:55.921 --> 25:59.925
{\an1}I feel like at
the end of the day,

25:59.991 --> 26:02.861
{\an1}you haven't really
suffered any consequences

26:02.928 --> 26:05.764
{\an1}with anything that you've
decided to do in your life.

26:05.830 --> 26:10.368
{\an4}You don't own your
responsibilities to
having a substance abuse.

26:10.435 --> 26:12.938
{\an5}One thing has nothing
to do with the other.

26:10.435 --> 26:12.938
Yes, it does.

26:13.004 --> 26:16.241
{\an5}It's almost like
you telling me--

26:13.004 --> 26:16.241
{\an1}'Cause you
were constantly high

26:16.308 --> 26:18.376
{\an1}at the end of the day
is all I'm saying.

26:18.443 --> 26:22.914
{\an4}I had to deal with
taking care of the kids
by myself for three years

26:22.981 --> 26:25.884
{\an1}because you decided
to use drugs.

26:25.951 --> 26:30.488
{\an4}I feel like if you don't
learn your lesson and you
don't take responsibility--

26:30.555 --> 26:32.123
{\an5}So you want me
to go to jail.

26:30.555 --> 26:32.123
No, I'm not saying that.

26:32.190 --> 26:33.858
{\an5}That's what you're saying.

26:32.190 --> 26:33.858
{\an1}And you don't take
responsibility

26:33.925 --> 26:36.328
{\an4}for the things that
you have done.

26:33.925 --> 26:36.328
All right, so then...

26:36.394 --> 26:40.165
{\an4}It's gonna continue,
and that's it. That's
all I'm saying to you.

26:40.231 --> 26:43.568
Our family is about to be
torn apart.

26:43.635 --> 26:47.572
Even though I know my man is
innocent, if he wasn't on drugs,

26:47.639 --> 26:52.444
{\an5}if his mind wasn't cloudy,
he wouldn't have found
himself in this situation.

26:52.510 --> 26:56.014
{\an5}I don't want to talk about
it no more 'cause this
is going left. You won.

Me knowing Yandy, I don't

by this whole secrets
and privacy thing with Juju.

27:35.720 --> 27:40.658
{\an8}She was just being her
normal annoying Yandy
self and that's it.

27:40.725 --> 27:43.995
Hey, chica!

27:40.725 --> 27:43.995
{\an3}Hi.

27:44.062 --> 27:48.700
{\an5}Nevertheless, Juju,
who is my friend, feels
some type of way about it,

27:48.767 --> 27:52.037
{\an5}so we have to take it
into consideration.
It has to be addressed.

27:52.103 --> 27:58.309
{\an8}So, I've been in babyland,
but it's been brought
to my attention

27:58.376 --> 28:01.079
that there's just been
a little tension going on.

28:01.146 --> 28:03.815
{\an5}I can tell her how I feel.

28:01.146 --> 28:03.815
Okay.

28:03.882 --> 28:07.519
{\an1}So, after our last
conversation at your house,

28:07.585 --> 28:10.688
{\an4}I feel like the secretive
thing stemmed from
you saying it.

28:10.755 --> 28:12.891
{\an1}You used my breakup
as an example.

28:12.957 --> 28:15.860
{\an4}None of my friends have
ever used the word that
I'm secretive.

28:15.927 --> 28:17.762
{\an1}Like I said, I don't
like the word "secretive,"

28:17.829 --> 28:21.066
{\an5}and the more I think about
it, the more I feel like
you're being a hypocrite,

28:21.132 --> 28:24.969
{\an4}because you did not
tell us about not signing
your marriage papers.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.672
I didn't tell my friends
about my wedding papers

28:27.739 --> 28:30.842
because we were figuring out
how we could do this.

28:30.909 --> 28:32.911
We were waiting for
his plea deal to come in.

28:32.977 --> 28:36.981
{\an5}With Juju's breakup,
I felt like she didn't
trust me enough

28:37.048 --> 28:41.953
to be a friend to her--
two very different situations.

28:42.020 --> 28:45.790
{\an5}When it came to me
and my husband at that
moment, we had decided

28:45.857 --> 28:49.761
{\an5}that this was something we
wanted to keep between us
until the time we signed,

28:49.828 --> 28:53.198
{\an5}so we wanted to hurry up
and do it before we
had to tell anybody.

28:53.264 --> 28:56.801
I feel like both of them
are exactly the same.

28:56.868 --> 29:00.839
You both have had instances
where you were secretive

29:00.905 --> 29:04.142
{\an5}and I don't feel like
it's anything to get
worked up about.

29:04.209 --> 29:06.544
{\an5}Like, it shouldn't
carry on anymore.

29:04.209 --> 29:06.544
{\an3}Yes.

29:06.611 --> 29:11.216
{\an4}Since we're talking,
and let's just clear
every single thing up,

29:11.282 --> 29:17.188
{\an5}when I did tell you ladies
about my breakup, before it
became public or anything,

29:17.255 --> 29:21.025
{\an5}my mother, my sister,
and then you two were
the only one to know,

29:21.092 --> 29:24.262
{\an4}and then a week later,
my ex, he was being
all defensive

29:24.329 --> 29:26.231
{\an1}and thinking that I said
something negative about him,

29:26.297 --> 29:28.666
{\an1}which I've never said
anything negative about him.

29:28.733 --> 29:35.874
{\an5}Now, did you talk to him?
Did you tell him anything?

29:28.733 --> 29:35.874
{\an3}Your ex?

29:35.940 --> 29:38.676
{\an6}No.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.676
{\an4}Okay.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.676
You know it wasn't me.

29:38.743 --> 29:42.247
{\an4}Whatever.

29:38.743 --> 29:42.247
Just, from now on, just don't
use the word "secretive,"

29:42.313 --> 29:44.649
"deceitful"--
don't even use private.

29:44.716 --> 29:46.684
Let's just take those words
out the whole vocabulary.

29:46.751 --> 29:48.987
{\an5}Lord have mercy.

29:46.751 --> 29:48.987
{\an1}Just accept me
for being private

29:49.053 --> 29:50.989
{\an4}and sharing things
when I want to share
and that's it.

29:51.055 --> 29:56.694
{\an5}I totally accept it and I
will not take it personal
that you don't trust me.

31:06.130 --> 31:12.870
{\an8}Oh, Rich! (laughs)
What up, brodie? Uhh!

31:06.130 --> 31:12.870
{\an5}What up, playboy?

31:12.937 --> 31:14.772

came with the ladies.

31:39.764 --> 31:42.433
That's how I spotted him.

31:42.500 --> 31:45.937
I didn't see what female
Rich was with, but y'all know

31:46.004 --> 31:48.706
I had to do a little bit
of jabs at him.

31:48.773 --> 31:54.412

Rich staying a mess.

32:00.118 --> 32:04.055
{\an5}What y'all been up to?
'Cause you know how I feel

32:04.122 --> 32:05.923
{\an1}How do you feel
about my business?

32:05.990 --> 32:07.925
You know how I feel
about your business.

32:07.992 --> 32:09.994
Your business has been
a little messy,

32:10.061 --> 32:12.263
'cause you always got
the ladies real close.

32:12.330 --> 32:14.732
{\an5}Why are you concerned
about my women or how
I'm doing my business?

32:14.799 --> 32:17.468
Because, as a female
in the industry,

32:17.535 --> 32:19.737
I have to do my
extra due diligence.

32:19.804 --> 32:22.073
{\an1}Extra due diligence
isn't walking in a room,

32:22.140 --> 32:25.143
{\an1}questioning somebody who
been in the game for 20 years.

32:25.209 --> 32:26.544
Have confidence.

32:25.209 --> 32:26.544
{\an3}Yeah?

32:26.611 --> 32:28.246
{\an1}But it's also
about being humble.

32:28.313 --> 32:30.915
{\an1}Humbleness
is what you exude.

32:30.982 --> 32:35.219
{\an8}What's up, what's up,
what's up?

32:35.286 --> 32:36.888
{\an1}See how she came

32:36.954 --> 32:40.591
{\an1}Bubbly, "Hey, how you doin'?
What's up?" Humble.

32:40.658 --> 32:42.960
Who is this?
Who is this, Richie?

32:43.027 --> 32:44.295
{\an5}How you doin', baby?

32:43.027 --> 32:44.295
This is Sidney Starr.

32:44.362 --> 32:46.064
{\an6}Okay.

32:44.362 --> 32:46.064
You should know
who I am.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.700
{\an5}I don't know who you are.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.700
I've actually been
famous before you.

32:48.766 --> 32:52.537
{\an5}I doubt that, baby, but
I don't know who you are.

32:57.175 --> 33:01.045
Walking in tonight,
I was my happily bubbly self,

33:01.112 --> 33:07.452
and this Nya chick looks at me
like, who are you, bitch? Heh!

33:07.518 --> 33:10.088
Trying to be a transgender
female in this industry,

33:10.154 --> 33:13.791
I've been rejected,
disrespected too many times,

33:13.858 --> 33:17.795
{\an5}so I'm used to dealing
with chicks that try
to come at me crazy.

33:17.862 --> 33:19.464
I'm gonna rap you under
the table 'cause you keep

33:19.530 --> 33:21.833
coming to my doorstep,
and you don't want this.

33:21.899 --> 33:23.601
{\an5}I promise you
don't want this.

33:21.899 --> 33:23.601
I'm hungry.

33:23.668 --> 33:25.269
{\an5}You need to go find
a play 'cause you ain't
gonna get it here.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.705
You ain't getting
served here, baby. Go!

33:27.772 --> 33:30.641
{\an5}Why are you so...?

33:27.772 --> 33:30.641
No! Stop it!

33:30.708 --> 33:33.044
{\an1}Sidney Starr, you and I
need to take a walk!

33:33.111 --> 33:34.412
{\an1}Nya...

33:33.111 --> 33:34.412
Sidney Starr!

33:34.479 --> 33:37.682
Nya is the pop-off queen

like, who are you, bitch?

is the energy down or naw?

33:56.968 --> 34:01.406

34:01.472 --> 34:05.209
{\an5}Jaquae, you don't think
she came off to me?

34:01.472 --> 34:05.209

{\an4}She just came from

a good time, high energy,

34:08.045 --> 34:11.181

try to shut down her
party. That's not good.

34:11.248 --> 34:13.985
{\an5}You don't want nobody
to come at your spot
like that and, like,

37:22.206 --> 37:25.476
You said you were moving

37:25.543 --> 37:27.578
Yeah, I feel like I was.

prior to the case?

37:27.645 --> 37:30.648
{\an3}Yeah.

37:33.084 --> 37:36.087
I mean, if I wasn't,
then you gotta tell me.

37:36.153 --> 37:38.856
{\an1}Well, we just talked
about this in the studio.

37:38.923 --> 37:41.258

the drug situation.

That has nothing, to me,
to do with anything.

37:43.594 --> 37:49.000
{\an4}But maybe that's the
issue. You're still in
denial about that,

37:49.066 --> 37:55.172
{\an5}and in order for us all
to move forward, we kind
of have to address that.

37:55.239 --> 37:57.975
I'm not in here for drugs.
I'm in here for a weapon.

LaRon, did you have
a drug issue or not?

about that, 'cause that
has nothing to do with...

to do with it, though.

38:03.047 --> 38:04.682
No, it doesn't.

38:03.047 --> 38:04.682
Yes, it does.

38:04.749 --> 38:08.152
{\an4}It has a lot to do with
you doing the right things
for your family too.

38:08.219 --> 38:10.287
So you was perfect
and I wasn't.

38:10.354 --> 38:13.591
No, I was perfect for the man
that I had at the time, so...

38:13.658 --> 38:15.292
No, you wasn't.

lying, 'cause I didn't
do nothing to you.

{\an1}Okay. What you want to say?
You didn't cheat on me?

38:23.534 --> 38:28.239
{\an5}So, is a relationship only
based on whether a person
cheated on you or not?

38:28.305 --> 38:33.811
{\an4}A relationship is based
on if the person has
been there for you,
