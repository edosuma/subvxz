00:12.360 --> 00:14.210
You'll win in eight moves.

00:15.967 --> 00:20.902
You're really starting to get a feel for the game.
32 pieces, 64 squares...

00:21.059 --> 00:25.609
It's not as if it's difficult.
The total number of possible outcomes is limited.

00:26.034 --> 00:29.238
Ten to the 123rd power.

00:29.243 --> 00:31.993
That's what I mean.
Chess is so predictable,

00:32.383 --> 00:34.933
I'm surprised anyone bothers to play it.

00:35.390 --> 00:38.590
Their average life span's
only about a hundred years.

00:38.776 --> 00:43.226
There's not enough time to play all the possible games.
What a waste. Careful.

00:43.705 --> 00:45.505
No emotional involvement.

00:45.762 --> 00:48.862
I know the rules:
observation without interference.

00:50.567 --> 00:51.317
Hmm.

00:55.341 --> 00:57.141
You'll win in five moves.

00:58.027 --> 00:59.777
I'm the ship's champion.

01:00.116 --> 01:01.966
I win all the tournaments.

01:04.623 --> 01:07.974
How do you think they'll react
to what's on this planet?

01:09.309 --> 01:14.609
Well, that's what we're here to find out,
but in my experience, all physical species are alike.

01:15.022 --> 01:19.822
I don't expect humans will be any different.
Do you think our hosts will die tonight?

01:20.656 --> 01:21.906
It's possible.

01:22.242 --> 01:27.692
For some of the species that have come here,
I've seen the whole crew die. For others, only a few.

01:28.594 --> 01:30.394
But somebody always dies.

01:31.413 --> 01:32.313
Always.

01:35.624 --> 01:36.674
Your move.

01:37.829 --> 01:38.729
[sighs]

01:42.307 --> 01:44.592
<i>It's been a long road</i>

01:46.750 --> 01:49.112
<i>Getting from there to here</i>

01:49.892 --> 01:51.909
<i>It's been a long time</i>

01:53.695 --> 01:56.897
<i>But my time is finally near</i>

01:57.567 --> 02:01.225
<i>And I will see my dream
come alive at last</i>

02:02.154 --> 02:04.783
<i>I will touch the sky</i>

02:05.358 --> 02:08.893
<i>And they're not gonna
hold me down no more</i>

02:09.113 --> 02:11.920
<i>No, they're not
gonna change my mind</i>

02:12.216 --> 02:16.654
<i>'Cause I've got faith
of the heart</i>

02:17.285 --> 02:19.978
<i>I'm going where my heart
will take me</i>

02:20.088 --> 02:24.095
<i>I've got faith to believe</i>

02:24.986 --> 02:27.541
<i>I can do anything</i>

02:27.910 --> 02:31.890
<i>I've got strength
of the soul</i>

02:32.669 --> 02:35.363
<i>No one's gonna bend
or break me</i>

02:35.509 --> 02:39.172
<i>I can reach any star</i>

02:41.403 --> 02:44.784
<i>I've got faith</i>
<i>I've got, I've got</i>

02:45.192 --> 02:47.554
<i>I've got faith</i>

02:49.042 --> 02:51.827
<i>Faith of the heart.</i>

03:06.541 --> 03:08.341
I can't wait to get back.

03:08.503 --> 03:13.152
Two days ago, you couldn't wait to get off the ship.
Sifting through a Klingon garbage dump--

03:13.152 --> 03:16.002
not my idea of "exploring
strange new worlds."

03:16.246 --> 03:20.646
Getting tired of exploration, Ensign?
All the planets starting to look alike?

03:20.680 --> 03:24.958
Not a chance, sir.
I didn't think so. [coughing]

03:24.958 --> 03:28.067
Oh, I feel like I'm still breathing dirt.

03:28.592 --> 03:31.292
Shuttlepod One to Enterprise.
Welcome back.

03:31.331 --> 03:35.431
How did your "treasure hunt" turn out?
Oh, nothing worth bringing home.

03:35.473 --> 03:37.159
The Klingons must've been here years ago.

03:37.159 --> 03:40.124
All they left was an old power cell
and a bunch of empty ration packs.

03:40.124 --> 03:41.300
And a latrine.

03:41.588 --> 03:42.388
Yeah.

03:42.670 --> 03:45.220
A long hot shower's looking
pretty good.

03:45.449 --> 03:46.949
Shuttlepod One out.

03:47.399 --> 03:50.492
[coughing]

03:50.492 --> 03:51.542
Commander?

03:52.731 --> 03:54.231
What-what's wrong?!

03:54.804 --> 03:55.954
Take over...

03:56.705 --> 03:59.749
Got to dock...
[hacking coughs]

04:01.236 --> 04:04.974
Shuttlepod One to Enterprise.
I have a medical emergency. [Tucker hacking]

04:04.974 --> 04:08.113
Commander Tucker's collapsed.
Can you bring the shuttlepod in?

04:08.113 --> 04:11.317
Yes, sir...
at least in simulations.

04:11.690 --> 04:13.440
Slow and steady, Ensign.

04:14.159 --> 04:16.409
I'll see you in Decon.
Understood.

04:21.411 --> 04:22.512
Call Phlox.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.836
Trip, how you feeling?

04:34.984 --> 04:35.884
[sighs]

04:35.966 --> 04:40.672
Like I've been gut-punched by a Tellarite...
Doctor, should we start with the bio-gel?

04:40.672 --> 04:42.695
Not until we know what we're dealing with.

04:42.695 --> 04:46.033
The three other landing parties returned
from the surface with no ill effects.

04:46.259 --> 04:51.609
We need to check out the shuttlepod, too,
see if any of its environmental systems were at fault.

04:51.734 --> 04:55.305
Well, I can do that, Captain. I should've thought
of that myself. Stay where you are, Trip.

04:55.305 --> 04:57.155
Phlox needs blood samples.

04:57.173 --> 04:58.673
Here's the medkits.

05:02.717 --> 05:05.429
[coughing]

05:06.615 --> 05:08.594
Hoshi... what is it?

05:09.263 --> 05:14.413
Before Commander Tucker passed out,
he started coughing. Are you feeling any other symptoms?

05:18.077 --> 05:19.127
[retching]

05:21.890 --> 05:25.284
I'm going to guess that's a yes.
I'll prepare anti-nausea medication.

05:25.284 --> 05:28.634
You get me those blood samples,
hmm, as soon as you can.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.040
Anything?

05:34.435 --> 05:37.493
Well, whatever's afflicting them,
it's not showing up on the standard scans.

05:37.493 --> 05:39.278
That doesn't sound good.
It's not.

05:39.917 --> 05:43.431
I studied your report on
how the Klingons reacted to the infection.

05:43.431 --> 05:47.066
Their response was typical
for a species at their level of development.

05:47.066 --> 05:50.291
The Klingon commander didn't let
his landing party back on his ship.

05:50.291 --> 05:52.724
Your point?
Captain Archer did.

05:53.148 --> 05:56.063
Captain Archer's done nothing
different from the Klingons.

05:56.063 --> 06:00.886
The launch bay and Decon Chamber
are completely isolated from the rest of the ship.

06:01.399 --> 06:04.563
So it doesn't matter
if an infected landing party comes aboard.

06:04.563 --> 06:10.192
Precisely. Humans don't want to interact
with dying crew mates any more than Klingons did.

06:10.743 --> 06:12.343
If it was left to me,

06:12.353 --> 06:14.803
I'd stop our observations immediately.

06:15.165 --> 06:18.815
We have nothing more to learn from humans.
Oh, I don't know...

06:18.909 --> 06:23.225
They're showing concern for each other.
The Cardassians did that when they were here, didn't they?

06:23.225 --> 06:27.725
Yeah, but in the end, they killed their infected crew
just as the Klingons did.

06:27.803 --> 06:32.520
The only difference is the time it took to reach that decision.
Maybe the humans will surprise us.

06:32.520 --> 06:35.120
I've been observing aliens for 800 years.

06:35.263 --> 06:39.513
I have yet to be surprised.
Still, we should follow protocol.

06:39.699 --> 06:43.799
Start questioning the infected crew,
and I'll check in with the Doctor.

06:44.593 --> 06:45.393
Okay.

06:46.346 --> 06:47.846
This is for nausea,

06:48.179 --> 06:49.429
muscle pain...

06:49.583 --> 06:51.333
and a cough suppressant.

06:51.347 --> 06:56.647
I'm not coughing anymore. Neither are you.
Maybe we're getting better. Well, Doctor's orders...

06:59.638 --> 07:00.688
Commander,

07:00.758 --> 07:02.858
Hoshi... just wanted to say hi.

07:04.193 --> 07:06.843
Uh, we're a little busy right now, Travis.

07:07.368 --> 07:11.318
Can you tell me what's in the hypospray?
Something for our symptoms.

07:11.606 --> 07:14.656
Yeah. Phlox doesn't know
what's wrong with us yet.

07:15.171 --> 07:18.121
Have either of you faced
serious illness before?

07:22.333 --> 07:23.991
Aren't you supposed to be on duty?

07:23.991 --> 07:29.065
I was curious to know how you'd compare this experience
with other illnesses you might've contracted.

07:29.680 --> 07:30.680
Travis...

07:32.402 --> 07:37.752
we really need to get some sleep. I only have
a few more questions. Thanks for stopping by. I...

07:52.369 --> 07:53.269
[sighs]

07:53.642 --> 07:55.192
Ah, Lieutenant Reed.

07:56.324 --> 07:58.224
Something I can do for you?

07:58.432 --> 07:59.432
Headache.

08:00.406 --> 08:02.406
Of course, uh, just a moment.

08:05.035 --> 08:09.735
Are these are the blood tests
for Commander Tucker and Ensign Sato? That's correct.

08:12.361 --> 08:16.163
Huh.
I'm not detecting any vascular involvement...

08:16.790 --> 08:17.540
Hmm?

08:18.059 --> 08:21.112
Your headache.
Not a bad one, I take it?

08:21.547 --> 08:22.914
Uh, no, not yet,

08:23.509 --> 08:27.159
although it feels like it could get worse.
Preventive measure.

08:27.236 --> 08:29.986
A lot to do today.
A mild analgesic it is...

08:31.449 --> 08:32.149
Oh.

08:32.530 --> 08:37.876
Doctor, I'm curious to know how you think
these tests will help you develop an effective treatment.

08:37.876 --> 08:38.826
So am I.

08:39.256 --> 08:43.077
I mean, are you approaching this
strictly on a symptomatic level, or do you believe

08:43.077 --> 08:48.006
there's any similarity to other conditions
you've seen in the past? [laughs] Ah.

08:48.488 --> 08:51.538
Lieutenant, I believe
I can put your mind at ease.

08:54.608 --> 08:59.565
If your colleagues have returned with a contagious
illness, there is no way it can spread to the rest of the ship.

08:59.565 --> 09:01.890
We are all quite safe.
I'm not worried about that.

09:01.890 --> 09:07.246
No, I'm interested in the methodology...
Out, out, out! I have a lot to do as well, hmm?

09:14.053 --> 09:16.303
You ever see The Andromeda Strain?

09:16.896 --> 09:18.196
Strain of what?

09:18.524 --> 09:19.924
No, it's a movie,

09:20.079 --> 09:21.479
mid-20th century.

09:22.440 --> 09:23.640
Let me guess.

09:23.746 --> 09:25.846
Dr. Andromeda builds a monster,

09:25.885 --> 09:27.835
and it kills him in the end.

09:29.022 --> 09:31.522
It's about an extraterrestrial disease.

09:31.950 --> 09:35.700
All your movies are the same.
I can't keep the stories straight.

09:36.320 --> 09:39.570
This reminds me of my dorm room
at Starfleet Training.

09:39.856 --> 09:42.256
Got into a lot of trouble
at old STC.

09:44.799 --> 09:46.199
I got kicked out.

09:51.734 --> 09:53.634
Well, you can't stop there.

09:54.109 --> 09:55.859
In my second month, I...

09:58.025 --> 10:01.425
I had a difference of opinion
with the Company Commander.

10:04.910 --> 10:06.260
I broke his arm.

10:08.309 --> 10:09.559
Can I ask why?

10:10.850 --> 10:11.700
Poker.

10:13.349 --> 10:15.499
You broke his arm playing cards?

10:15.974 --> 10:21.237
Well, he tried to shut down a game I was running for
some of the recruits, uh, and a couple of the training staff.

10:21.237 --> 10:22.352
Hold on...

10:24.676 --> 10:27.076
You ran a floating poker game at STC?

10:27.654 --> 10:29.680
The way the regulations are worded,

10:29.680 --> 10:33.986
gambling was an honor violation
only if it took place during duty hours,

10:34.484 --> 10:36.534
so I ran the game on weekends.

10:36.992 --> 10:41.542
One night, my CC showed up,
tried to sweep all the chips off the table, and I...

10:42.922 --> 10:45.272
Well, I have a black belt in Aikido.

10:46.963 --> 10:51.263
I think he was just upset that
I hadn't invited him to play. What happened?

10:54.416 --> 10:56.466
I got a bad conduct discharge.

10:59.431 --> 11:02.081
How the hell did you end up on Enterprise?

11:02.312 --> 11:07.297
Starfleet needed language specialists
more than they needed to make an example out of me.

11:07.297 --> 11:09.624
They let me back in on probation, and...

11:10.269 --> 11:11.169
[sighs]

11:12.692 --> 11:13.892
...here I am.

11:15.344 --> 11:16.094
Hmm.

11:17.561 --> 11:20.561
The closest classification
it matches is a virus.

11:20.611 --> 11:22.161
Highly contagious...

11:22.407 --> 11:23.737
silicon-based.

11:25.895 --> 11:27.845
This is an M-Class planet...

11:28.000 --> 11:33.122
All life forms down there should be carbon-based.
I can only surmise the virus was brought here,

11:33.122 --> 11:37.696
perhaps by a meteorite, which could explain
why only one of our landing parties encountered it.

11:37.696 --> 11:42.546
Is there a treatment? There's no record
of anything like it in the Denobulan database.

11:44.128 --> 11:45.678
Then it's up to you.

11:47.001 --> 11:51.166
I'll do all I can, Captain,
but at the rate the pathogen is reproducing...

11:51.166 --> 11:54.737
Commander Tucker and Ensign Sato have
less than five hours to live.

12:04.564 --> 12:06.864
The Doctor identified the pathogen.

12:06.931 --> 12:08.490
Ah. That happens

12:09.419 --> 12:11.017
37% of the time.

12:11.945 --> 12:15.895
But no one's made the decision
to abandon the infected crew members.

12:16.219 --> 12:19.719
Then this'll likely be one of the times
when everyone dies.

12:21.823 --> 12:22.573
Mmm.

12:35.682 --> 12:37.893
Travis, if that's you again...

12:39.008 --> 12:39.958
It's me.

12:43.591 --> 12:46.191
Next time I ask
to go on a landing party,

12:46.963 --> 12:48.713
talk me out of it, okay?

12:48.732 --> 12:52.132
You're usually too stubborn
to be talked out of anything.

12:52.681 --> 12:54.231
But I'll do my best.

12:57.866 --> 12:59.016
How's Hoshi?

12:59.228 --> 13:00.228
Sleeping.

13:00.569 --> 13:02.269
Whatever Phlox gave us,

13:02.696 --> 13:05.046
at least it's helping with the pain.

13:05.463 --> 13:09.563
Phlox identified what's causing all the trouble.
A silicon-based virus.

13:11.154 --> 13:15.504
I don't suppose he's on his way
over here with the cure. He's working on it.

13:16.703 --> 13:17.853
So is T'Pol.

13:19.014 --> 13:20.614
So, there is no cure.

13:21.819 --> 13:22.769
Not yet.

13:24.503 --> 13:28.832
I'm getting the idea you're up against a deadline.
If you mean how much time do you have,

13:28.832 --> 13:33.782
it's too early for that kind of talk.
Your own immune system could knock this thing out.

13:34.162 --> 13:37.086
I remember Exobiology 101, Captain.

13:38.683 --> 13:40.433
Humans are carbon-based.

13:40.691 --> 13:43.141
Our immune system can't fight silicon.

13:44.581 --> 13:46.331
Don't you give up on me.

13:48.132 --> 13:51.732
There are still a bunch of planets out there
we haven't seen.

13:53.715 --> 13:54.965
Get some rest.

14:06.905 --> 14:10.333
We're looking for signs of elevated intelligence
in the species we observe.

14:10.333 --> 14:14.105
Rational intelligence, yes--
which Archer has not demonstrated.

14:14.422 --> 14:18.487
The longer the infected crew remain on board,
the greater the risk that quarantine will fail.

14:18.487 --> 14:21.471
I'm sure Captain Archer knows exactly
what the risk is.

14:21.471 --> 14:24.216
Maybe it's not as important to him as
standing by his crew.

14:24.216 --> 14:28.383
It's just as probable that he hasn't realized
how hopeless the situation is.

14:29.646 --> 14:31.446
There's a way to be sure.

14:35.874 --> 14:39.180
We chose the Helmsman and the Armory Officer
for good reason.

14:39.180 --> 14:44.094
They're both stationed on the Bridge,
yet neither plays a critical role in a medical emergency.

14:44.144 --> 14:47.593
Which is why we should inhabit the Doctor and
the Science Officer.

14:47.593 --> 14:52.442
Archer relies on their findings to make his decisions.
We could witness that as it happens.

14:52.968 --> 14:57.466
The more people we inhabit, the greater the chance
that we will inadvertently interfere.

14:57.466 --> 15:01.116
The more people we inhabit,
the more we'll be able to observe.

15:03.850 --> 15:06.050
How many languages
can you speak?

15:06.661 --> 15:08.411
That's not how it works.

15:08.822 --> 15:12.260
There are a lot of common patterns.
I'm just good at hearing them, that's all.

15:12.260 --> 15:14.201
Good? You're a genius.

15:16.099 --> 15:18.388
The way you can pick up an alien language
you've never heard before

15:18.388 --> 15:20.551
and start spouting it back to them...

15:21.500 --> 15:25.050
I got to tell you,
I've always been jealous you can do that.

15:25.351 --> 15:27.601
I wish I could fix warp engines...

15:28.120 --> 15:30.370
with duct tape and a pocket knife.

15:31.009 --> 15:34.737
It's...
a bit more complicated than that...

15:34.971 --> 15:36.021
sometimes.

15:37.992 --> 15:39.692
Seriously, engineering,

15:40.018 --> 15:41.418
building things--

15:41.830 --> 15:45.526
have you always been good at that?
Mmm... when I was a kid,

15:46.981 --> 15:48.731
not so good at building.

15:48.925 --> 15:52.225
But I was a terror when it came
to taking things apart.

15:53.074 --> 15:58.124
My folks used to put all our kitchen appliances
on the highest shelves. One Thanksgiving--

15:58.224 --> 16:01.074
I have no idea
what I was thinking, but, um...

16:01.436 --> 16:06.682
I removed every screw from this
big dining room table we had.

16:07.058 --> 16:09.958
It was so old, the wood
sort of stuck together,

16:10.033 --> 16:11.783
so it stayed standing...

16:12.723 --> 16:16.023
until my dad put the turkey down.
[laughing weakly] Oh!

16:16.089 --> 16:19.239
I spent the next month in my room.
How old were you?

16:19.543 --> 16:22.247
Oh, hmm, 24, 25.

16:34.142 --> 16:37.442
How long have they been there?
We didn't see you there.

16:38.476 --> 16:41.976
We didn't want to interrupt you.
How's the research coming?

16:43.161 --> 16:45.411
We're waiting on new test results.

16:45.546 --> 16:48.546
We thought we'd see
how you two were progressing.

16:49.303 --> 16:51.953
You're the ones
with the medical scanners.

16:51.994 --> 16:55.761
We were more interested in discussing
your state of mind. Oh...

16:56.467 --> 16:59.267
Look, if you really want
to know how we feel,

17:00.069 --> 17:05.019
we'd be a lot better knowing you two
were back in Sick Bay working on the cure for this.

17:05.281 --> 17:06.332
Of course.

17:06.771 --> 17:08.422
We're going there now.

17:10.582 --> 17:12.868
Commander. Ensign.

17:19.498 --> 17:21.298
They both came to see us.

17:21.865 --> 17:27.315
Maybe that means they're almost finished. [sighing]
Yeah, unless there's nothing more they can do.

17:28.309 --> 17:31.309
They're very brave,
the way they're facing death.

17:31.966 --> 17:35.266
Their courage isn't at question.
Their intelligence is.

17:35.510 --> 17:38.760
You want the humans to fail.
This isn't a competition.

17:39.249 --> 17:43.899
Either a species' intelligence is developed enough
for First Contact, or it isn't.

17:44.291 --> 17:47.225
Perhaps we should consider other qualities
in making our decision.

17:47.225 --> 17:49.782
This is the measure we have used
for 10,000 years.

17:49.782 --> 17:53.839
It's not our responsibility to change it.
Then whose responsibility is it?

17:54.274 --> 18:00.227
There. If Phlox is right about the virus coming
here on a meteorite, that crater might be the source of it.

18:00.227 --> 18:03.992
Which means the Klingons at this campsite
must have been infected, too.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.595
Set up a priority channel to Starfleet Command.

18:06.595 --> 18:10.462
We need to find out which Klingon ship explored this world,
and whether or not they developed a cure.

18:10.462 --> 18:12.219
Right away, sir.

18:14.339 --> 18:17.589
Those are the new test results
my host is waiting for.

18:18.795 --> 18:22.295
We should leave these creatures
to their work, undisturbed.

18:23.287 --> 18:26.787
The Helmsman and the Armory Officer
are back on the Bridge.

18:34.687 --> 18:37.587
The altered immune receptors
weren't effective.

18:39.726 --> 18:43.526
This could indicate the virus
is sensitive to ionizing radiation.

18:46.433 --> 18:51.783
At levels that would be fatal to humans, but it's a start.
I'll prepare new samples for testing.

18:55.213 --> 18:56.213
[sighing]

18:57.002 --> 19:00.436
Shiranai... Oboenai...

19:00.704 --> 19:02.804
Hoshi...
[speaking German]

19:03.772 --> 19:05.972
[speaking French]
Hoshi, wake up.

19:08.950 --> 19:10.550
I was back in Brazil.

19:11.716 --> 19:13.216
[breathing heavily]

19:15.494 --> 19:19.494
The shuttle was coming to take me to Enterprise.
That's where we are.

19:28.899 --> 19:30.999
Captain Archer needed me early.

19:33.366 --> 19:36.666
I didn't get the chance
to say good-bye to my students.

19:39.468 --> 19:41.118
You'll see them again.

19:46.485 --> 19:51.224
I've heard from Starfleet. They're working
through diplomatic channels to contact the Klingons.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.274
But it might not be necessary.

19:54.357 --> 19:57.157
This spectrograph identifies a Klingon alloy.

19:57.289 --> 20:00.139
That's the signature of standard hull plating.

20:00.362 --> 20:01.562
I found it...

20:02.815 --> 20:03.615
here.

20:05.444 --> 20:09.822
You've detected a debris cloud in orbit.
It's what's left of a Klingon shuttlecraft--

20:09.822 --> 20:14.722
their response to an infected landing party.
The Commander killed his own shuttle crew.

20:15.148 --> 20:17.348
They didn't even plead for mercy.

20:18.994 --> 20:21.994
I mean, they wouldn't, would they?
Being Klingon.

20:22.475 --> 20:26.683
Captain, does knowing what the Klingons did
help us at all?

20:27.688 --> 20:30.710
At least we know we don't have to bother
asking them if they have a cure.

20:30.710 --> 20:34.260
But if they had developed one,
you'd ask them for it, right?

20:36.696 --> 20:37.996
On bended knee.

20:42.297 --> 20:44.097
Yo se que estoy atrasada.

20:44.666 --> 20:46.866
Enterprise no se va hasta ma~ana.

20:47.008 --> 20:49.409
Solo necesito cinco minutos.

20:49.934 --> 20:50.884
Hoshi...

20:52.873 --> 20:57.003
we're in quarantine for a reason.
[speaking Klingon]

20:58.343 --> 21:00.593
I have no idea
what you're saying,

21:01.443 --> 21:03.893
but you can't break the lock-out code.

21:04.740 --> 21:06.790
Math is just another language.

21:08.658 --> 21:09.908
[alarm blares]

21:12.013 --> 21:13.963
Quarantine breach on D-Deck.

21:14.698 --> 21:17.048
The Decon Chamber has been unsealed.

21:20.123 --> 21:21.523
[alarm continues]

21:26.533 --> 21:28.033
[breathing heavily]

21:37.513 --> 21:38.813
[alarm blaring]

21:39.604 --> 21:43.120
Someone's overriding the safety interlocks.
Shut down all power to D-Deck!

21:43.120 --> 21:44.970
I want those doors sealed!

21:45.291 --> 21:46.812
[beeping]

21:52.512 --> 21:55.037
Hoshi...
you have to stop.

21:56.411 --> 21:57.861
That's an airlock.

21:58.018 --> 22:01.618
You open those doors, we die.
Haye nuzhno skazat dosvidaniya.

22:02.143 --> 22:03.473
Hoshi, come on.

22:03.876 --> 22:05.576
I need to tell them...!

22:06.986 --> 22:08.036
[grunting]

22:13.034 --> 22:14.984
...while there's still time.

22:15.803 --> 22:17.853
The Captain won't let us down.

22:18.616 --> 22:21.590
[alarm blaring]

22:30.753 --> 22:31.953
[alarm stops]

22:44.062 --> 22:45.312
Trip to, um...

22:49.216 --> 22:50.766
whoever's out there.

22:53.472 --> 22:54.572
We're back.

22:55.227 --> 22:59.527
Commander, I want you to set your hypospray
for three units of sonambutril.

23:03.673 --> 23:07.217
That could drop a horse.
We can't risk Hoshi wandering off again.

23:07.217 --> 23:11.580
Especially since it seems she can override
every security safeguard on Enterprise.

23:14.502 --> 23:15.752
Yeah, she's...

23:16.677 --> 23:18.427
full of surprises today.

23:42.501 --> 23:44.151
Sweet dreams, Houdini.

23:48.964 --> 23:50.214
Anything else?

23:52.218 --> 23:58.223
It's your turn, Trip. Come on, Captain.
Commander, the virus is incompatible with carbon-based life.

23:58.293 --> 24:02.980
It's attacking your bodies in ways I can't predict.
You think I'm going to wander off, too?

24:02.980 --> 24:06.830
Start opening the wrong doors?
Not if you're sedated. Sorry, Trip.

24:17.282 --> 24:18.432
Commander...

24:21.418 --> 24:25.118
I'm just wondering if either one of us
will ever wake up again.

24:29.226 --> 24:32.576
You should lie down right away.
I won't argue with that.

24:37.392 --> 24:39.692
How close are you to stopping this?

24:40.453 --> 24:45.984
T'Pol and I have isolated a specific frequency of radiation
that disrupts the silicon matrix of the virus.

24:46.499 --> 24:50.749
That sounds promising.
Unfortunately, the dosage required would be lethal.

24:51.478 --> 24:55.858
There's got to be some kind of a trade-off--
a way to produce enough radiation

24:55.858 --> 25:00.358
to slow down the virus without killing the patient.
That's what I'm working on.

25:01.057 --> 25:02.207
Work faster.

25:13.096 --> 25:15.896
We can stop what this virus is doing to them.

25:16.143 --> 25:17.690
That's not why we're here.

25:17.690 --> 25:22.944
We came to observe their response to the unexpected,
not to watch them suffer.

25:23.663 --> 25:26.763
This is not the place
to be having this discussion.

25:27.338 --> 25:29.738
I know where we can talk undisturbed.

25:35.782 --> 25:40.132
[groaning softly] The sensations
in this host are different from the others.

25:40.563 --> 25:42.063
I'm experiencing...

25:42.316 --> 25:43.566
physical pain.

25:44.894 --> 25:45.844
So am I.

25:47.393 --> 25:50.098
Why should any species
have to endure this weakness?

25:50.098 --> 25:52.925
Because the desire
to overcome it will spur them

25:52.941 --> 25:58.091
to move beyond the limitations of the physical world.
Maybe that isn't true for all species.

25:58.433 --> 25:59.933
It was true for us.

26:06.044 --> 26:07.544
You can't be awake.

26:11.189 --> 26:13.289
Not with that much sonambutril.

26:15.979 --> 26:19.901
Our ancestors were physical beings.
What worked for us might not work for everyone.

26:19.901 --> 26:23.337
Humans have different qualities.
Nothing I haven't seen before.

26:23.473 --> 26:28.139
What do you have against this species?
What disturbs me most out the humans

26:27.236 --> 26:31.439
is their capacity for violence.
Extraordinary. Klingons embrace violence.

26:31.894 --> 26:36.494
The humans try to avoid it.
Humans say they avoid it, but their words don't ma...

26:39.069 --> 26:40.669
We're being observed.

26:44.962 --> 26:46.512
Ah, Captain, T'Pol--

26:46.776 --> 26:51.681
I was just coming to see you. These are brain wave
readings of Commander Tucker and Ensign Sato.

26:51.681 --> 26:53.481
What is the significance?

26:54.038 --> 26:55.888
The patterns aren't human.

26:56.576 --> 27:00.926
Did you know they had this capability?
He must've used Denobulan technology.

27:04.974 --> 27:05.824
I see.

27:07.845 --> 27:11.701
Are you responsible for what happened to my patients?
We had nothing to do with it.

27:11.701 --> 27:15.630
We come here only to study
how physical species react to the unknown.

27:15.922 --> 27:19.141
You can help by telling us
how you detected our presence.

27:19.141 --> 27:21.881
That happens in less than
two percent of our missions.

27:24.339 --> 27:28.737
Commander Tucker and Ensign Sato were sedated.
They shouldn't have been able to stand and talk.

27:28.737 --> 27:32.755
It's been so long since we had physical form,
we weren't able to distinguish sleep from sedation.

27:32.755 --> 27:34.555
We'll remember next time.

27:36.292 --> 27:41.203
Is there anything you can do to help my patients?
We're here to observe. We can't interfere.

27:41.203 --> 27:44.303
You're interfering with me!
Our subjects are human.

27:44.623 --> 27:46.023
You're Denobulan.

27:46.414 --> 27:51.329
You were inhabited a few hours ago.
An intriguing experience. I have no recollection of that.

27:51.329 --> 27:53.379
Memories are simple to adjust.

27:56.078 --> 27:58.678
You're going to "adjust" mine again, hmm?

27:59.209 --> 28:04.156
So I won't remember a word of this encounter.
Or what you observed in the Decon Chamber.

28:04.156 --> 28:08.356
If you have that ability, you must be able
to help my patients. We could.

28:08.562 --> 28:09.762
But we won't.

28:12.739 --> 28:14.889
Thank you for your help, Doctor.

28:15.839 --> 28:17.839
No wonder you erase memories.

28:18.126 --> 28:20.026
Your behavior is appalling.

28:22.568 --> 28:27.434
According to what I read on the Doctor's medical PADD,
he's learned how to stop the infection.

28:27.434 --> 28:31.784
I've seen seven other species develop the radiation cure.
But never in time.

28:32.139 --> 28:35.589
Did we make First Contact with any of them?
Of course not.

28:35.726 --> 28:40.276
Expending resources to attempt an impossible task
is not a sign of intelligence.

28:40.334 --> 28:43.634
The Captain and Science Officer
have decisions to make.

28:44.177 --> 28:46.727
We need to return to our original hosts.

28:50.318 --> 28:54.762
For the radiation to destroy the virus
without killing the patient, it must be precisely focused.

28:54.762 --> 28:59.612
The emitters in the Decon Chamber aren't suitable,
but the bio-scanner in Sick Bay is.

28:59.712 --> 29:02.062
To move them from Decon to Sick Bay,

29:02.953 --> 29:05.603
we'll need to expand
the quarantined area.

29:06.360 --> 29:08.110
That won't be a problem.

29:08.599 --> 29:10.649
We're going to make this work.

29:19.746 --> 29:23.246
Ensign Sato's condition is deteriorating.
We need to hurry.

29:35.638 --> 29:37.188
Engaging quarantine.

29:38.215 --> 29:40.865
Reed to Bridge.
I confirm a positive seal.

29:41.717 --> 29:44.017
Environmental systems are isolated.

29:44.399 --> 29:46.399
Entering the quarantine zone.

30:09.232 --> 30:12.482
She's going into oligemic shock.
Captain, she's dying.

30:16.157 --> 30:19.784
[grunting]

30:24.314 --> 30:26.264
Get her on the bio-scan bed.

30:31.307 --> 30:33.057
She's stopped breathing.

30:38.876 --> 30:40.426
Someone always dies.

30:46.446 --> 30:47.696
[sighs]
Hoshi!

30:48.395 --> 30:50.645
[flatline beeps on monitor]
Phlox!

30:53.374 --> 30:54.324
[grunts]

30:54.531 --> 30:58.831
What are you doing?! This equipment's not
designed for EV gloves! [panting]

30:59.646 --> 31:01.996
I'll be your hands.
No, Captain, no!

31:03.292 --> 31:07.142
Right now, Enterprise needs a doctor
more than it needs a captain!

31:07.999 --> 31:09.290
[panting]

31:09.475 --> 31:11.455
[unsnapping]

31:27.981 --> 31:30.431
Attach the leads 20 centimeters apart.

31:32.286 --> 31:33.806
[panting]

31:35.109 --> 31:36.609
I don't understand.

31:37.309 --> 31:38.509
In 800 years,

31:38.998 --> 31:41.298
no one's ever done that before?
No.

31:42.601 --> 31:48.101
Not once they know it's hopeless. You need to
inject 40 units of trinephedrine into her heart, hmm?

31:49.678 --> 31:53.528
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That...
That can't go deep enough.

31:53.687 --> 31:54.937
[both panting]

32:01.810 --> 32:03.810
Old-fashioned, but effective.

32:05.306 --> 32:07.656
Angle it slightly more to the right.

32:08.521 --> 32:11.871
Now in one quick motion,
insert it to three centimeters.

32:14.737 --> 32:16.287
Press the activator.

32:21.340 --> 32:22.190
Clear.

32:23.093 --> 32:24.805
[electronic hum]

32:32.191 --> 32:33.491
Come on, Hoshi.

32:35.472 --> 32:36.822
300 millijoules.

32:41.067 --> 32:42.067
[panting]

32:45.957 --> 32:47.257
Captain.
Again!

32:48.028 --> 32:49.508
[panting]
340.

32:58.077 --> 33:00.876
She's gone.
[panting]

33:03.483 --> 33:05.983
Captain, help me with Commander Tucker.

33:08.209 --> 33:11.859
How many have to die before you'll admit
humans are different?

33:12.266 --> 33:13.866
We need to stop this.

33:14.254 --> 33:16.404
I will not depart from protocol.

33:16.630 --> 33:18.380
The incident isn't over.

33:18.510 --> 33:23.320
When the first death occurs on the ship,
there's a 68% chance the rest of the crew will become infected.

33:23.320 --> 33:25.473
What more will that teach us about them?

33:26.062 --> 33:30.662
All this would have happened whether we were here or not.
We are not responsible.

33:32.754 --> 33:34.254
Maybe we should be.

33:41.785 --> 33:45.185
We need to move him into the scanner.
[panting continues]

33:49.809 --> 33:53.933
[panting continues]

34:15.135 --> 34:16.435
It didn't work.

34:17.820 --> 34:19.320
I'm sorry, Captain.

34:24.168 --> 34:25.819
Not your fault, Doctor.

34:25.819 --> 34:29.300
There's nothing more I can do for Commander Tucker,
but you've still got a few hours.

34:29.300 --> 34:33.576
There... There has to be something else
I-I... I can try.

34:36.176 --> 34:38.926
You should continue your work
on the Bridge.

34:40.110 --> 34:44.110
Less chance of something going wrong with your suit.
I won't give up.

34:45.699 --> 34:47.550
You know where to find me.

35:09.311 --> 35:10.661
Archer to T'Pol.

35:11.779 --> 35:13.329
T'Pol here, Captain.

35:14.766 --> 35:16.866
I take it you've been watching.

35:17.065 --> 35:17.965
I have.

35:19.563 --> 35:21.713
Then you know you're in command?

35:22.125 --> 35:23.325
Yes, Captain.

35:25.146 --> 35:27.946
I would like to think
you'll stay in command.

35:28.478 --> 35:33.490
Don't let Admiral Gardner
sneak in someone over your head.

35:34.238 --> 35:35.588
I'll do my best.

35:36.572 --> 35:37.922
I know you will.

35:46.230 --> 35:48.280
I need to look after Trip now.

35:51.327 --> 35:53.227
We'll talk again, before...

35:56.018 --> 35:57.418
We'll talk again.

35:58.708 --> 35:59.758
Captain...

36:00.721 --> 36:03.271
if Commander Tucker
becomes conscious...

36:04.650 --> 36:06.650
I'll let you know right away.

36:10.177 --> 36:11.277
Archer out.

36:47.888 --> 36:53.362
[breathing stops, flatline beeps on monitor]

36:58.236 --> 37:00.986
I have such respect for you, Captain Archer.

37:07.020 --> 37:07.820
Trip?

37:08.176 --> 37:09.326
Not exactly.

37:11.009 --> 37:12.409
I'm an Organian--

37:14.071 --> 37:15.821
a nonphysical life-form.

37:17.033 --> 37:18.383
Trip is my host.

37:21.140 --> 37:23.290
What did you do to him?
Nothing.

37:24.277 --> 37:27.977
We never interfere
in the natural development of other species.

37:28.582 --> 37:29.932
We only observe.

37:32.282 --> 37:34.682
Did you know about the silicon virus?

37:35.526 --> 37:37.276
That's why we come here.

37:38.869 --> 37:42.319
To see how different species
react when they encounter it.

37:44.202 --> 37:49.602
You knew about the virus that killed two members of my crew,
and you didn't warn us? I wanted to.

37:50.955 --> 37:52.605
But it's not up to me.

37:53.497 --> 37:57.331
You're breaking every rule we have.
Because they don't apply to this species.

37:57.331 --> 37:59.531
That is not our decision to make.

37:59.599 --> 38:03.399
If we don't challenge the rules...
I don't care about your rules.

38:03.506 --> 38:07.940
Tell me what happens to Trip and Hoshi
when you're finished with their bodies.

38:07.940 --> 38:09.940
We have to leave them as they are.

38:13.135 --> 38:13.935
Dead?

38:20.145 --> 38:26.123
I understand why you won't get involved
with a species' natural development.

38:26.919 --> 38:30.569
I've faced that decision myself.
It isn't an easy one to make.

38:30.654 --> 38:32.604
Then we agree.
No, we don't.

38:33.666 --> 38:38.266
Our encounter with the virus was an accident--
one that you could have prevented.

38:38.302 --> 38:40.802
Then how would we ever learn about you?

38:41.065 --> 38:41.965
Ask us.

38:42.670 --> 38:43.770
Talk to us!

38:45.765 --> 38:50.215
Just like you're doing now.
Talking is a limited form of communication for us.

38:50.697 --> 38:54.547
We're much more advanced than humans.
Not from where I'm standing.

38:57.391 --> 38:59.908
Maybe you've evolved into beings

39:00.130 --> 39:03.201
with abilities I can't comprehend,

39:03.566 --> 39:05.663
but you've paid a hell of a price.

39:05.663 --> 39:08.656
You've lost compassion and empathy--

39:10.926 --> 39:12.976
things that give life meaning.

39:14.233 --> 39:16.833
If that's what it takes to be advanced...

39:20.397 --> 39:22.347
I don't want any part of it.

39:24.961 --> 39:26.861
We're leaving now, Captain.

39:27.135 --> 39:30.435
You won't remember a thing about our presence.
[coughs]

39:30.786 --> 39:33.336
And in three hours, you'll die, as well.

39:34.358 --> 39:35.058
No.

39:37.379 --> 39:42.329
We have the power to save them all.
Are you defying me? I'm defying the entire protocol.

39:44.043 --> 39:45.993
What Archer has done today--

39:46.470 --> 39:48.220
his act of compassion...

39:50.238 --> 39:54.288
you've never witnessed that before.
In time, we'll study other humans.

39:54.924 --> 39:56.474
There's another way.

39:57.497 --> 40:00.752
Experience compassion for yourself.

40:02.779 --> 40:05.819
You want to know
what it means to be human,

40:07.644 --> 40:09.844
you need to do more than observe.

40:16.711 --> 40:18.311
Archer to the Bridge.

40:19.065 --> 40:20.415
T'Pol. Go ahead.

40:20.649 --> 40:23.399
You wanted to know when Trip was awake.
Yes.

40:23.986 --> 40:27.972
Well, you'd better get down here
because he's talking up a storm, and so is Hoshi.

40:27.972 --> 40:33.222
Captain, Hoshi's... You, too, Phlox.
Maybe one of you can tell me what the hell just happened.

40:37.532 --> 40:40.082
You're all completely free of the virus.

40:40.640 --> 40:44.768
It has to have been a delayed reaction
to Commander Tucker's radiation treatment,

40:44.768 --> 40:47.468
but how it spilled over to you and Hoshi...

40:48.084 --> 40:49.548
I have no explanation.

40:49.548 --> 40:53.763
Obviously, the pathogen's behavior
is more unpredictable than we assumed.

40:53.763 --> 40:57.528
I'm sure someone at Starfleet Medical
will figure it out, but for now,

40:58.630 --> 41:03.580
we're going to leave a warning beacon in orbit here
and make sure what happened to us...

41:03.759 --> 41:05.809
never happens to anyone again.

41:06.850 --> 41:09.547
You realize the consequences of what we've done.

41:09.547 --> 41:13.028
We will never be able to observe
another species encounter this virus.

41:13.192 --> 41:13.992
Good.

41:16.064 --> 41:21.214
I'm looking forward to making my first report.
After 10,000 years, the rules need to change.

41:24.244 --> 41:28.944
These humans have not been a good influence on you.
I would not encourage further encounters.

41:28.944 --> 41:30.812
I don't think we can avoid them.

41:30.812 --> 41:35.078
I'm going to recommend that we start preparations
for an Official First Contact mission.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.060
Indeed.

41:36.615 --> 41:39.750
At the rate they're progressing,
that'd barely give us 5,000 years to prepare.

41:39.750 --> 41:41.586
Then we'd better get started.
