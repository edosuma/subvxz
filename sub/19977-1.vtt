00:11.369 --> 00:12.601
Hello?

00:12.637 --> 00:14.170
Surprise!

00:17.286 --> 00:18.852
Tribeca, you silly goose.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.185
It's your surprise
retirement party, girl.

00:21.186 --> 00:23.824
Oh, my God. You guys totally got me!

00:26.395 --> 00:28.862
Not gonna be the same around
here without you, Tribeca.

00:28.898 --> 00:31.899
There's even talk of retiring
your unisex blazer.

00:31.934 --> 00:33.112
Thank you, sir.

00:34.072 --> 00:36.537
Tribeca, the very best of luck.

00:36.572 --> 00:37.835
It's been a pleasure working with you.

00:37.837 --> 00:40.642
You too, Dr. Edelweiss.
I feel exactly the same.

00:40.676 --> 00:42.876
Well, actually, I might be
leaving the force myself soon.

00:42.925 --> 00:45.667
Yes, it appears the ethics lawsuit
is gonna be pushed forward...

00:45.669 --> 00:47.582
- Hoffman!
- and I don't know what I'm going to do.

00:47.617 --> 00:48.515
I'm running out of money.

00:48.551 --> 00:50.136
Hey!

00:50.137 --> 00:51.937
I think someone's
gonna miss you the most.

00:51.939 --> 00:54.639
Oh, I'm gonna miss you, too, Hoffman.

00:54.675 --> 00:57.442
That's why you pay in advance.

01:00.362 --> 01:02.380
All right, everybody, it's a party.

01:02.416 --> 01:04.416
Come eat some cake.

01:08.054 --> 01:10.281
Happy retirement, partner.

01:11.525 --> 01:13.792
You know you don't
have to do this, right?

01:13.827 --> 01:16.361
Everything's changed.

01:16.396 --> 01:17.729
- We have a kid.
- Mm.

01:17.764 --> 01:20.927
And I don't want to miss
one moment of little...

01:22.536 --> 01:24.803
- Angie
- Angie's childhood.

01:24.838 --> 01:25.937
I know.

01:25.973 --> 01:27.564
I mean, he's not gonna be...

01:29.341 --> 01:31.596
- 2 1/2
- 2 1/2 forever.

01:32.613 --> 01:35.380
- You know what I mean, right?
- Geils.

01:35.415 --> 01:37.048
- Right.
- Yeah.

01:37.117 --> 01:40.021
Yeah, I think it's time
to put the police work behind me

01:40.123 --> 01:42.071
and go balls deep into motherhood.

01:43.390 --> 01:44.521
Do me a favor?

01:45.459 --> 01:47.592
Recycle these for me.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:04.311 --> 02:05.810
No one say a word.

02:05.846 --> 02:07.045
Motherhood is not for everyone.

02:07.080 --> 02:08.812
It doesn't me any less of a woman.

02:08.848 --> 02:11.504
So I don't want to hear a peep
out of any of you.

02:23.897 --> 02:25.864
I have bronchitis.

02:37.978 --> 02:39.411
Hey!

02:39.446 --> 02:40.979
Hey!

02:41.014 --> 02:43.060
Get that off of my street!

02:44.384 --> 02:45.085
You can't park that there.

02:45.087 --> 02:46.352
I can't hear you because of the chopper.

02:46.386 --> 02:47.719
Move that thing off of my street.

02:47.754 --> 02:49.521
Ah!

02:49.556 --> 02:50.722
Ah!

02:50.757 --> 02:52.865
- Spare change?
- Love some.

02:58.765 --> 03:00.098
Ow.

03:00.133 --> 03:02.434
Oh, hello, Mr. Farnsworth.

03:02.469 --> 03:03.835
Where's my white rhino?

03:03.870 --> 03:05.905
Uh, well, we've actually
only begun the process.

03:05.906 --> 03:07.337
Whoa! Did I just tune in

03:07.374 --> 03:09.874
to some boring documentary
about your pathetic little life?

03:09.910 --> 03:11.576
Let me see if I can change the channel.

03:11.611 --> 03:13.111
No. Nope!

03:13.146 --> 03:14.679
Ah, there's the show I like.

03:14.715 --> 03:17.209
The one where you give me
my stuffed white rhino.

03:17.211 --> 03:19.003
It's just that you
dropped it off yesterday.

03:19.003 --> 03:20.085
- Stuff it!
- I just... I...

03:20.120 --> 03:23.488
Stuff it, or I will stuff you.

03:24.925 --> 03:26.844
Is there any way to spruce up this owl

03:26.845 --> 03:28.559
in time for the children's exhibit?

03:28.595 --> 03:30.662
Aww. I-It...

03:37.804 --> 03:40.472
Let's go, Ricardo.
I haven't got all day.

03:42.743 --> 03:44.175
Wait a minute.

03:44.211 --> 03:45.550
You're not Ricardo.

03:49.745 --> 03:51.916
Welcome back, Tribeca.
Not a moment too soon.

03:51.952 --> 03:53.985
I'm afraid the unthinkable has happened.

03:54.636 --> 03:56.146
A rich white man's disappeared.

03:56.239 --> 03:59.252
Duncan Farnsworth I.I.I. disappeared

03:59.253 --> 04:01.191
from his helicopter two days ago.

04:01.228 --> 04:03.105
I'm pretty sure it's the third, sir.

04:03.191 --> 04:04.362
Already seeing a pattern.

04:04.397 --> 04:05.914
How'd we get along without you?

04:05.915 --> 04:07.052
What do we know about this guy

04:07.053 --> 04:09.114
other than his dad
and grandfather's first name?

04:09.115 --> 04:12.137
Married, three kids,
got rich inventing an oil

04:12.172 --> 04:14.539
- that doesn't wash off penguins.
- Got it.

04:14.574 --> 04:16.107
And, Tribeca, if you need to split time

04:16.142 --> 04:17.742
between your son and the office,

04:17.778 --> 04:19.711
- we'll work around it.
- Not a problem, sir.

04:19.745 --> 04:21.512
We sent little Angie off
to a private boarding school

04:21.548 --> 04:22.714
in Maine.

04:22.749 --> 04:24.415
We're really hoping he gets in.

04:24.451 --> 04:26.414
As long as we're swapping
personal stuff,

04:26.415 --> 04:29.395
I, uh... I've decided
to start dating again.

04:29.790 --> 04:31.823
I'm staring down the dark,
black abyss of retirement,

04:31.858 --> 04:35.627
and it would be nice
to drag someone down with me.

04:36.251 --> 04:37.618
We'll keep an eye out, sir.

04:38.131 --> 04:39.623
And, uh, Tribeca.

04:40.534 --> 04:42.500
Make sure she knows how
to pick out fruit in a grocery,

04:42.536 --> 04:43.535
if you know what I mean.

04:43.570 --> 04:44.602
I do not.

04:44.638 --> 04:45.522
Copy that.

04:46.097 --> 04:49.186
Turns out Mr. Farnsworth was
very popular on the Internet.

04:49.776 --> 04:52.210
Hoffman, show them what you found.

04:58.552 --> 05:00.952
Farnsworth was a trophy hunter.

05:00.987 --> 05:05.130
Stanley Cup, Heisman,
big plate from Wimbledon,

05:05.782 --> 05:08.522
then he turned his interest
to endangered species.

05:10.497 --> 05:12.797
Geez, look at some of
these negative comments.

05:12.833 --> 05:14.499
"Die, you worthless P.O.S."

05:14.534 --> 05:16.100
"You're everything
wrong with the world."

05:16.136 --> 05:18.937
"Make $40 an hour working from home"?

05:18.972 --> 05:22.073
This guy didn't vanish.
Somebody grabbed him.

05:22.108 --> 05:25.476
And it looks like we have
about 60,000 suspects.

05:25.512 --> 05:28.146
We gonna need a shitload of handcuffs.

05:28.181 --> 05:30.352
All right, Tanner, you
and Hoffman go talk to the wife,

05:30.352 --> 05:32.095
and Geils and I will try to track down

05:32.096 --> 05:33.617
the helicopter pilot who saw him last.

05:33.653 --> 05:35.019
We got an address on him.

05:35.559 --> 05:37.536
Ricardo Vasquez.

05:37.891 --> 05:39.441
But it's in Miami.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.617
Looks like we're taking
this show on the road.

05:54.608 --> 05:56.040
Can I help you?

05:56.076 --> 05:58.576
We're looking for
a Ricardo Vasquez. Is he home?

05:58.612 --> 06:00.778
Oh, Mr. Vasquez moved back
to Los Angeles.

06:00.814 --> 06:02.680
Okay, thank you very much.

06:14.594 --> 06:17.795
A trophy hunter? My husband?

06:17.831 --> 06:19.797
There must be some mistake.

06:19.833 --> 06:21.766
There's no mistake, ma'am.

06:21.801 --> 06:23.167
Is this your husband?

06:23.964 --> 06:25.536
Yes, that's my husband.

06:25.572 --> 06:27.605
I don't recognize that rug
he's holding, though.

06:28.742 --> 06:30.775
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

06:30.810 --> 06:32.010
Besides in the photo.

06:32.045 --> 06:33.211
Mm.

06:33.246 --> 06:34.679
Two days ago.

06:34.714 --> 06:36.614
Anything unusual about his behavior?

06:36.650 --> 06:38.283
Except murdering everything he sees?

06:39.036 --> 06:40.285
Oh, he got up,

06:40.320 --> 06:41.986
prayed in front of a portrait
of himself,

06:42.021 --> 06:43.720
had a glass of camel milk,

06:43.757 --> 06:46.624
and took off in his
helicopter... Typical Thursday.

06:46.660 --> 06:48.791
Ma'am, this is a serious situation.

06:49.162 --> 06:51.129
Now, I think your husband
might be kidnapped.

06:51.164 --> 06:53.765
Or worse, he was kidnapped.

06:53.800 --> 06:57.302
Look, this is
clearly a matter for the police.

06:57.337 --> 06:58.803
Now, if you'll excuse me,

06:58.838 --> 07:00.699
I need to get on with my day.

07:06.046 --> 07:07.045
Ahh.

07:11.829 --> 07:14.496
I've always wanted to meet
a helicopter pilot.

07:16.922 --> 07:17.988
Can I help you?!

07:18.023 --> 07:19.289
Are you Ricardo Vasquez?

07:19.324 --> 07:20.623
I'm sorry?!

07:20.659 --> 07:22.592
Are you Ricardo Vasquez?!

07:22.627 --> 07:23.750
Yeah, that's me!

07:23.751 --> 07:25.795
LAPD, sir! Do you mind if we ask you

07:25.831 --> 07:27.330
a couple questions?!

07:27.366 --> 07:28.898
Yeah, sure, come on in!

07:28.973 --> 07:31.275
Keep your heads down! It's gonna be fun!

07:35.207 --> 07:37.240
We wanted to ask you
a couple of questions

07:37.275 --> 07:39.175
about your employer, Duncan Farnsworth.

07:39.211 --> 07:40.710
Yeah, go ahead.

07:40.746 --> 07:42.178
You're his pilot, right?

07:42.214 --> 07:44.080
And you were flying with him
on the morning of the 19th?

07:44.116 --> 07:46.783
- Affirmative.
- And now Farnsworth and his helicopter

07:46.818 --> 07:47.884
are both missing.

07:47.919 --> 07:49.719
Care to shed any light on that?

07:49.755 --> 07:51.821
I dropped off Farnsworth
at the taxidermy shop,

07:51.857 --> 07:53.390
and then I went to get a coffee.

07:53.425 --> 07:56.292
When I got back, Farnsworth
and the chopper were gone.

07:56.328 --> 07:59.262
Grand Canyon on your left.

07:59.297 --> 08:02.365
I find it hard to believe
that you left your helicopter

08:02.401 --> 08:04.401
in the middle of the street
to go get a coffee.

08:04.436 --> 08:06.102
Sounds pretty implausible, doesn't it?

08:06.138 --> 08:08.004
Well, you got me. I was lying.

08:08.974 --> 08:11.007
Truth is, some dude
slipped me 1,000 bucks

08:11.043 --> 08:12.642
to disappear for 10 minutes.

08:12.677 --> 08:14.644
We're gonna need you
to come down to the station

08:14.679 --> 08:16.046
and talk to a sketch artist.

08:16.081 --> 08:17.180
Sounds great.

08:17.215 --> 08:18.415
One more question.

08:18.450 --> 08:20.717
Are you concerned about your employer?

08:20.752 --> 08:22.318
To tell you the truth, ma'am,

08:22.354 --> 08:23.953
he was not a very nice person.

08:24.994 --> 08:25.755
Thank you, sir.

08:25.791 --> 08:27.057
Let us know if you hear anything.

08:27.092 --> 08:28.725
Let's go, Geils.

08:50.473 --> 08:53.041
Tribeca, welcome back.
I heard you had retired.

08:53.167 --> 08:55.620
Well, I guess you can
take the girl out of the cop,

08:55.620 --> 08:57.175
but you can't take the cop
out of the girl.

08:57.940 --> 08:58.516
I could.

08:58.518 --> 09:00.828
Monica, Tribeca and I are together.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.079
You have to accept that.

09:03.328 --> 09:05.539
They said you had an idea
on the Farnsworth case?

09:05.540 --> 09:06.783
Yes. Come over here.

09:07.564 --> 09:09.783
It's not too often
a rich white guy goes missing,

09:09.784 --> 09:10.754
so it got me thinking.

09:11.632 --> 09:13.649
This is an unsolved case
from a few months ago.

09:13.689 --> 09:17.017
This is, or was,
Lawrence T. Boozler VII.

09:17.144 --> 09:19.244
You mean, like Boozler University,

09:19.245 --> 09:21.551
Boozler Steaks, Boozler Wine & Spirits?

09:21.551 --> 09:24.285
That's him, or that was him
until he was kidnapped,

09:24.285 --> 09:25.951
stripped naked, beheaded, and mounted.

09:25.986 --> 09:28.687
Don't tell me... he was a trophy hunter.

09:28.722 --> 09:30.322
Bingo.

09:31.892 --> 09:33.826
This guy is still out there.

09:33.861 --> 09:36.361
And if it's the same one
that has Farnsworth,

09:36.397 --> 09:38.155
we're looking at a serial killer.

09:38.732 --> 09:40.232
And we're running out of time.

09:40.267 --> 09:41.284
So sorry.

09:41.769 --> 09:43.268
Package for Angie Tribeca.

09:43.304 --> 09:45.904
Dr. Edelweiss? What are you doing?

09:45.940 --> 09:48.957
Since I left the force, I've had
to pick up any job I can.

09:49.310 --> 09:51.373
I'm afraid the package came open.

09:51.846 --> 09:53.745
I think it's some kind of scale cream,

09:53.781 --> 09:54.980
but I didn't look.

09:55.015 --> 09:56.315
Thanks.

09:56.350 --> 09:57.449
As you were.

09:58.555 --> 09:59.985
This guy is still out there.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.786
And if it's the same one
that has Farnsworth,

10:03.123 --> 10:04.767
we're looking at a serial killer.

10:05.259 --> 10:07.259
And we're running out of time.

10:13.100 --> 10:16.335
Oh, good, you're awake.

10:17.438 --> 10:21.106
Who are you? What do you want from me?!

10:21.141 --> 10:24.042
I'll ask the questions
if you don't mind.

10:24.078 --> 10:26.812
Who am I? What do I want from you?

10:26.847 --> 10:28.981
All in due time.

10:29.016 --> 10:31.750
Meanwhile, enjoy your accommodations.

10:36.891 --> 10:39.157
Hey! Hey!

11:02.580 --> 11:04.428
All right, what do we know so far?

11:04.538 --> 11:07.072
Um, I'm Beth Wiedner.

11:07.107 --> 11:10.442
I'm from Pittsburgh,
and I have two sisters.

11:11.041 --> 11:13.008
I don't like it.
Something doesn't add up.

11:13.043 --> 11:14.476
Oh, well, I was born in Cleveland,

11:14.511 --> 11:15.844
but I moved to Pittsburgh when I was 3.

11:15.879 --> 11:17.446
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

11:17.481 --> 11:18.880
I'm gonna dig into the breadsticks

11:18.916 --> 11:20.754
while you got to bar
and get us a couple of drinks.

11:20.776 --> 11:23.808
Actually, I think the waiter will
It's not a request, Wiedner!

11:23.821 --> 11:26.388
Hang on. I have to take this.

11:26.390 --> 11:28.233
You hit the breadsticks while I go see

11:28.234 --> 11:30.322
what I can dig up on this "waiter."

11:30.323 --> 11:31.098
Atkins.

11:32.676 --> 11:33.683
A serial killer?

11:34.499 --> 11:36.465
I'll be right there.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.966
Sorry, Wiedner.

11:39.362 --> 11:40.974
This is gonna have to wait.

11:48.239 --> 11:49.031
Mom.

11:50.107 --> 11:51.560
I think I met the one.

11:51.982 --> 11:53.342
It's bad, Lieutenant.

11:53.376 --> 11:55.198
I think we have an animal-rights fanatic

11:55.198 --> 11:56.512
who's targeting trophy hunters.

11:56.547 --> 11:59.214
He's already kidnapped one
man... stripped and mounted him.

11:59.602 --> 12:00.934
And I have a hunch
he's gonna do the same

12:00.970 --> 12:02.569
- to Farnsworth.
- Do we have any leads?

12:02.605 --> 12:04.382
What the hell do we know about this guy?

12:04.383 --> 12:06.083
We have a sketch
from the helicopter pilot

12:06.119 --> 12:07.618
who saw Farnsworth last.

12:07.653 --> 12:09.620
Sorry. I shouldn't have
jogged over here.

12:09.686 --> 12:10.909
Do you have any idea what's gonna happen

12:10.910 --> 12:11.700
when the press figures out

12:11.701 --> 12:13.392
that there's a crazy serial killer

12:13.642 --> 12:15.559
singling out rich white men?!

12:15.595 --> 12:17.461
We understand the stakes, sir.

12:17.497 --> 12:19.583
I want ideas!

12:20.733 --> 12:23.667
Do we have anybody inside
the animal-rights movement?

12:23.703 --> 12:24.867
We had a mole,

12:24.868 --> 12:26.934
but they rescued him and set him free.

12:27.673 --> 12:30.474
I know someone who might know something.

12:42.688 --> 12:43.475
Who?

12:44.223 --> 12:45.149
The Zookeeper.

12:45.150 --> 12:46.871
Tribeca, no.

12:47.627 --> 12:49.093
Who's the Zookeeper?

12:50.373 --> 12:52.878
The Zookeeper, or Dr. Thomas Hornbein,

12:52.879 --> 12:56.539
was a psychopath Tribeca
put away 10 years ago,

12:56.540 --> 12:57.902
back when you were in diapers.

12:57.903 --> 12:58.904
How'd you know about that?

12:58.905 --> 13:00.722
He was a world-renowned
doctor of zoology

13:00.723 --> 13:03.601
and an extremist
in the animal-rights movement.

13:03.602 --> 13:05.469
He preached that humans were the ones

13:05.504 --> 13:07.404
who belonged in a zoo, not animals.

13:07.439 --> 13:10.307
So he'd kidnap zoo-goers,
locked them in his basement,

13:10.342 --> 13:12.209
feed them fruit and peanuts,

13:12.244 --> 13:13.644
and parade animals in front of them

13:13.679 --> 13:16.280
to laugh and jeer
as they humped one another.

13:16.315 --> 13:18.115
Now he's the one who's in a cage.

13:19.251 --> 13:21.285
- Let's go talk to him.
- No.

13:21.320 --> 13:23.153
I have to go alone.

13:23.189 --> 13:25.355
We have a special relationship.

13:28.753 --> 13:30.889
Do not touch the glass. Do
not approach the glass.

13:30.890 --> 13:33.906
If he attempts to pass
you something, do not take it.

13:33.907 --> 13:35.466
If he asks what you're doing on Friday,

13:35.466 --> 13:36.841
say you have family in town.

13:36.876 --> 13:38.786
And if he brings up "Game of Thrones,"

13:38.786 --> 13:40.904
you tell him you haven't seen it yet.

13:45.518 --> 13:48.606
Hey, baby.

13:48.778 --> 13:51.628
Hubba-hubba. I likey what I see.

13:51.666 --> 13:54.667
Hey, baby! I... Uh, bangs.

14:01.709 --> 14:03.509
Ms. Tribeca.

14:04.578 --> 14:06.245
Dr. Hornbein.

14:09.217 --> 14:11.650
Mmm. You've been well.

14:11.686 --> 14:13.125
Do I smell a child?

14:13.855 --> 14:15.565
You smell a lot, Doctor.

14:16.357 --> 14:18.324
Oh, please. Please sit.

14:21.429 --> 14:23.429
So, what brings you
to the Mennen Speed Stick

14:23.464 --> 14:25.197
Maximum Security Prison?

14:26.020 --> 14:27.800
We keep sweat locked up.

14:27.835 --> 14:29.101
We need your help.

14:29.136 --> 14:31.255
Hmm. That is ironic, isn't it?

14:31.739 --> 14:34.607
Like the way Miss Piggy
considers herself desirable.

14:34.642 --> 14:37.209
We realize the unusual nature
of this request,

14:37.245 --> 14:39.678
but I wouldn't be here if it weren't
a matter of life and death.

14:39.714 --> 14:41.614
Let me put it to you this way.

14:41.649 --> 14:45.202
I will do something for you
if you do something for me,

14:45.686 --> 14:47.486
for there is no Latin expression

14:47.521 --> 14:49.289
that would better describe this.

14:49.757 --> 14:51.390
- What do you want?
- I want to be transferred

14:51.425 --> 14:53.974
to a Courtyard Marriott
with an indoor pool.

14:54.262 --> 14:58.764
I want $670,000 in cash
and prizes no matter what I bid.

14:58.799 --> 15:00.327
We can arrange that.

15:00.376 --> 15:02.541
And I want to know something...

15:03.771 --> 15:06.813
personal about you.

15:07.408 --> 15:08.806
You're a madman.

15:09.543 --> 15:11.125
You're gonna die in here.

15:12.213 --> 15:14.173
As will Mr. Farnsworth.

15:15.383 --> 15:17.416
Oh, yes, I know all about Mr. Boozler

15:17.451 --> 15:19.485
and Mr. Farnsworth, Ms. Tribeca.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.220
You may want
to adjust the privacy settings

15:21.255 --> 15:22.981
on your Facebook page.

15:23.791 --> 15:25.291
What do you want to know?

15:25.326 --> 15:26.892
Your hair, your tail... you're in heat!

15:26.928 --> 15:28.518
You have a boyfriend.

15:29.597 --> 15:31.330
I... I mean...

15:31.365 --> 15:32.798
Do you love him?

15:34.769 --> 15:36.146
It's complicated.

15:36.837 --> 15:38.369
Yes. No.

15:38.973 --> 15:40.372
I don't know.

15:43.611 --> 15:45.177
Well, there was
an animal-rights activist

15:45.212 --> 15:46.899
that came to visit me a few years ago.

15:47.315 --> 15:49.248
Very intense,
very devoted to the cause...

15:49.283 --> 15:50.728
perhaps too devoted.

15:51.686 --> 15:54.701
And if you're here,
that means he has struck again.

15:55.256 --> 15:56.019
What's his name?

15:56.020 --> 15:57.913
Why is it so hard for you

15:57.929 --> 16:01.493
to let people in, Tribeca?

16:01.529 --> 16:05.631
Because... I don't know who I am.

16:07.601 --> 16:08.701
Oh.

16:08.728 --> 16:09.678
Wow.

16:10.705 --> 16:12.069
That's super heavy. Shit.

16:13.274 --> 16:14.340
You should talk to someone.

16:14.375 --> 16:16.542
What's his name, Dr. Hornbein?

16:16.577 --> 16:18.377
His name was...

16:18.412 --> 16:21.393
and keep in mind these
letters will be scrambled...

16:22.650 --> 16:26.352
Obrin Saydor.

16:26.387 --> 16:27.953
Address?

16:29.088 --> 16:29.755
Hold on one second.

16:29.790 --> 16:32.958
Let me figure out
what it would be scrambled.

16:32.994 --> 16:34.072
421...

16:36.597 --> 16:39.465
Chuntset...

16:39.500 --> 16:40.646
Treest.

16:41.335 --> 16:44.336
Ols Gangeles, Calionifa.

16:44.372 --> 16:45.637
Okay, yeah, I got it. I got it. Yeah.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.339
Yeah, well,
wait a minute. Wait a minute.

16:47.375 --> 16:48.530
Let me walk you out.

16:50.073 --> 16:52.096
There's some real maniacs in here.

16:59.941 --> 17:02.842
All right, we figured out
his name... Robin Dorsay.

17:02.877 --> 17:05.411
But we're getting nowhere
on the address.

17:05.445 --> 17:07.512
So think, people, think.

17:08.849 --> 17:10.516
A man's life is at stake.

17:14.222 --> 17:15.688
Sandwich man here.

17:15.723 --> 17:17.857
Uh, who ordered
the, uh, grilled vegetables

17:17.892 --> 17:19.631
- on ciabatta?
- That's me.

17:19.632 --> 17:23.262
Uh, Chuntest, Chunsest?

17:23.297 --> 17:24.463
Tushcent!

17:24.499 --> 17:25.897
No, there's no Tushcent Street.

17:25.933 --> 17:27.465
We're running out of time.

17:27.502 --> 17:28.834
Chicken salad on rye?

17:28.870 --> 17:29.663
Right here.

17:30.471 --> 17:31.865
I got it. I got it. It's...

17:31.866 --> 17:34.185
- Meatball Parmesan?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:35.376 --> 17:37.370
Go ahead, Tanner. What do you got?

17:38.579 --> 17:40.412
I'm sorry. I lost it.

17:45.887 --> 17:49.788
Chuntset... Chuntset... Chuntset.

17:49.824 --> 17:52.691
Tribeca, are you listening to me?

17:55.630 --> 17:57.730
Chestnut. It's Chestnut Street.

17:57.765 --> 17:59.398
Chestnut Street.

17:59.433 --> 18:00.766
Good, there is one of those.

18:00.801 --> 18:02.185
Nice work, Tribeca.

18:02.381 --> 18:04.603
All right, people, let's move.

18:04.639 --> 18:08.541
I've got a tuna bomb,
heavy on the mustard, no name.

18:13.714 --> 18:15.447
Bedroom 1... clear.

18:15.483 --> 18:17.750
Bedroom 2... clear.

18:17.785 --> 18:20.753
Hot Pockets in the freezer? Yay!

18:24.425 --> 18:26.425
Duncan Farnsworth? LAPD.

18:26.460 --> 18:27.760
You're okay.

18:32.533 --> 18:34.433
Who's there?

18:34.468 --> 18:36.001
Geils?

18:36.037 --> 18:37.736
Tanner?

18:45.980 --> 18:47.980
Who's there?

18:48.015 --> 18:50.716
Robin Dorsay?

18:50.751 --> 18:52.885
You're under arrest.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.820
We have your house surrounded.

19:02.363 --> 19:04.063
I'm warning you.

19:12.073 --> 19:14.607
Tribeca, what are you doing
wandering around the basement?

19:14.642 --> 19:16.575
We checked the whole house and...

19:16.611 --> 19:18.010
Oh, no.

19:19.880 --> 19:21.513
Farnsworth.

19:21.549 --> 19:22.881
We're too late.

19:22.917 --> 19:24.617
At least he died with a great body.

19:24.652 --> 19:26.051
Look at these lats.

19:29.423 --> 19:30.462
Oh, my God.

19:46.173 --> 19:48.774
He's making suits out of human clothes.

19:50.111 --> 19:51.036
What?

19:52.046 --> 19:54.046
Robin Dorsay...
if that's even his real name...

19:54.081 --> 19:55.848
he's killing trophy hunters,

19:55.883 --> 19:58.751
and he's giving their clothes
to the animals.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.621
With these human clothes,
the animals would be able

20:02.657 --> 20:04.040
to hide in plain sight.

20:05.059 --> 20:07.433
Totally camouflaged from their hunters.

20:08.029 --> 20:10.744
He's got a taste
for making animal outfits now.

20:11.966 --> 20:13.409
He won't stop.

20:14.802 --> 20:16.602
Tribeca, I know that look.

20:16.637 --> 20:18.103
Don't tell me
you're developing an obsession

20:18.139 --> 20:20.105
- with the killer.
- No.

20:20.141 --> 20:21.540
No, not at all.

20:24.979 --> 20:25.953
Tribeca.

20:26.881 --> 20:28.384
It's the killer.

20:28.746 --> 20:32.080
Hey, you.

20:32.116 --> 20:33.682
No, now's a great time.
