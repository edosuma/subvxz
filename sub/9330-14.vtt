00:01.523 --> 00:03.742
Yes! Finally a shot of
your Grandma Bon-Bon

00:03.833 --> 00:06.133
without a glass of wine in her hand.

00:06.168 --> 00:08.452
We're making your family
tree, not your family vineyard.

00:10.172 --> 00:12.072
Stupid paste.

00:12.107 --> 00:15.475
Hey! Whatever you do, don't try to
get it off with the other hand...

00:15.527 --> 00:18.478
then your shoe... then the
wall. It's just a vicious cycle.

00:20.282 --> 00:23.266
I'm just helping Emma
out with a school project.

00:23.319 --> 00:25.252
And from the looks of
this, I think everyone will know

00:25.287 --> 00:27.220
the Wheelers are a pretty classy bunch.

00:27.222 --> 00:32.174
Bam! Guess who just punched
an 80-year-old for this baby?

00:32.226 --> 00:34.127
Hey, if you're old
enough to hit the sales rack,

00:34.163 --> 00:36.224
you're old enough to
take a hanger to the head.

00:36.265 --> 00:39.499
I will definitely be the hottest mom

00:39.535 --> 00:41.485
at the preschool's Family Night.

00:43.105 --> 00:44.554
First of all, you're not Emma's mom,

00:44.590 --> 00:47.374
and second of all, we
already voted, and it's Lacey's mom.

00:48.544 --> 00:51.328
Hey, do we have any pictures
of Nana Lyle?

00:51.363 --> 00:55.265
My mother? God, no. She
doesn't show up on film.

00:56.335 --> 00:58.135
I love Nana Lyle.

00:58.187 --> 01:00.153
Danny, how could you? You
met her like four times.

01:00.189 --> 01:03.090
She always sends me cards for
my birthday and Christmas.

01:03.125 --> 01:04.191
And that one time I got really sick,

01:04.226 --> 01:07.427
she sent a get well card, then I did!

01:07.479 --> 01:10.397
She's magical. Why do you hate her?

01:10.432 --> 01:13.483
I don't hate her. I
just wouldn't be wrecked

01:13.535 --> 01:16.386
if she shriveled up and blew away.

01:16.422 --> 01:17.626
So... want some help?

01:17.792 --> 01:19.489
Pretty sure I can handle doing a
two-year-old's homework on my own.

01:19.525 --> 01:21.341
See?

01:23.228 --> 01:24.378
Oh, hey!

01:24.413 --> 01:25.413
You found a picture of me

01:25.414 --> 01:28.248
without a glass of wine in my hand.

01:28.300 --> 01:30.384
Must've been pregnant.

01:45.317 --> 01:49.269
So, expect just a few
clouds early in the day.

01:49.271 --> 01:53.323
I'm Tucker Dobbs, the
forecast machine on your TV screen.

01:53.358 --> 01:54.357
Back to you, Pamela.

01:54.410 --> 01:57.194
That's Tucker Dobbs with the weather.

01:57.246 --> 01:59.246
Uh, Tucker, any big
plans for the weekend?

02:03.419 --> 02:05.168
Nope.

02:06.422 --> 02:08.288
Back to you, Pamela.

02:08.289 --> 02:10.257
Well, maybe you'll head to the beach?

02:10.292 --> 02:13.343
I said, "Back to you, Pamela."

02:13.378 --> 02:16.379
Well, it sounds like the
weather's gonna be pretty nice.

02:16.432 --> 02:19.299
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's
literally what I just said.

02:19.351 --> 02:21.301
Time for you to do your job now!

02:21.353 --> 02:23.303
- Pamela: Okay.
- Do not attempt

02:23.355 --> 02:25.222
to adjust your television screens.

02:25.274 --> 02:27.307
Tucker Dobbs really is horrible.

02:27.309 --> 02:28.358
Back to you, Bonnie.

02:28.393 --> 02:31.311
Oh, I can't talk
good. Back to you, Riley!

02:33.365 --> 02:37.200
Hey! Hey! I told you
guys to stop watching this.

02:37.236 --> 02:38.368
All right, and it's not even my fault.

02:38.403 --> 02:40.403
Nobody told me I had to chit chat.

02:40.456 --> 02:41.921
You want spontaneous,

02:42.071 --> 02:43.323
you have to give me some warning.

02:43.375 --> 02:46.293
Oh my god, you know
what? I can help you with that.

02:46.328 --> 02:47.975
I just signed up for this improv class

02:47.977 --> 02:49.412
to help with my courtroom repartee.

02:49.465 --> 02:51.381
Totally my decision.

02:51.416 --> 02:53.383
It's not at all forced on me.

02:53.418 --> 02:56.303
100 percent everybody does it.

02:56.338 --> 03:00.340
Okay, yeah, well, I don't
even need to take improv class

03:00.342 --> 03:02.142
because I'm...

03:03.178 --> 03:05.345
Well, the reason is... is...

03:05.347 --> 03:07.314
Okay, maybe I do need to take improv.

03:07.349 --> 03:10.267
We can sign up online at my place.

03:10.319 --> 03:12.352
Hey, Mom, don't forget
tomorrow is Family Day,

03:12.354 --> 03:14.271
so I'm gonna need you on time, sober,

03:14.323 --> 03:16.356
and dressed at least PG-13.

03:16.408 --> 03:19.276
Mild nudity, got it.

03:20.943 --> 03:22.362
But I also wanted to give you

03:22.364 --> 03:23.826
a little heads-up that we're gonna have

03:23.829 --> 03:26.199
at least one small
addition to Family Day.

03:26.251 --> 03:30.203
If your father brings his new
wife, Steve, I get to dress R-rated.

03:31.423 --> 03:33.340
And it's "hell no" to sober.

03:35.327 --> 03:38.512
What? No. Nana Lyle is coming.

03:40.199 --> 03:42.549
What have you done?

03:42.551 --> 03:45.535
Well, you didn't have her
picture, so I invited the real deal.

03:45.587 --> 03:47.103
She needs to meet Emma.

03:47.155 --> 03:49.539
Okay, okay, fine. Just
make sure that you give me

03:49.575 --> 03:51.491
a little warning before she gets here.

03:51.527 --> 03:56.329
Cancel your plans, boys, you've got
a hot date with your Nana Lyle.

03:59.351 --> 04:01.301
I brought a gift for Emma,

04:01.336 --> 04:04.120
but I didn't bring
anything for you boys.

04:04.156 --> 04:07.224
Wait a minute. What's this?

04:09.111 --> 04:11.044
All: Yay!

04:12.180 --> 04:15.165
Why am I not shocked they're all ones?

04:15.200 --> 04:19.101
Oh my god, look at you
boys, you're so beautiful.

04:19.154 --> 04:20.470
And how's my little angel?

04:20.505 --> 04:22.088
Oh, you know, I'm good.

04:22.089 --> 04:24.424
- I meant this one.
- Okay.

04:24.459 --> 04:25.458
The only angel you have

04:25.510 --> 04:28.361
is tattooed on your ass, sweetie.

04:28.363 --> 04:31.298
Oh, you're just gorgeous.

04:31.300 --> 04:34.200
Oh my goodness. She looks just like you.

04:34.253 --> 04:37.237
And you look just like
me, so, you're welcome.

04:38.273 --> 04:40.121
(high-pitched) Can I
see you boys for a sec?

04:41.376 --> 04:45.128
You two wouldn't understand what
it's like to have a terrible mother,

04:45.180 --> 04:46.596
because you have me!

04:46.632 --> 04:49.549
But there are a lot of people out
there who don't like their mothers.

04:49.585 --> 04:52.118
- Well, we...
- Pick your battles, bro.

04:52.154 --> 04:53.587
You need to get rid of her.

04:53.639 --> 04:56.798
No. You need to suck it up or suck it
in, or suck whoever needs to get sucked,

04:56.799 --> 04:58.260
so we can have a beautiful weekend

04:58.261 --> 05:00.425
where Emma gets to hang out
with her wonderful great-grandmother.

05:00.426 --> 05:02.379
She gave us cash, Mom,

05:02.431 --> 05:05.282
And you know that carries a
lot of weight in this family.

05:05.334 --> 05:09.269
Okay. Fine. But when
Emma is emotionally scarred

05:09.304 --> 05:13.089
by that ice cap in
spandex, don't blame me.

05:13.125 --> 05:16.509
♪ Out came the sun and
dried up all the rain ♪

05:16.545 --> 05:20.513
♪ And the itsy-bitsy spider

Wow. What a monster.

05:25.387 --> 05:27.387
- You never sang to me.
- Shut up.

05:30.392 --> 05:33.426
Okay, everybody, here we
go, deep breaths and...

05:33.462 --> 05:36.212
ooh, let's warm it up.

05:36.248 --> 05:38.164
It's banana time!

05:38.216 --> 05:41.151
Form banana, form a banana.

05:41.186 --> 05:43.203
Peel banana, peel a banana.

05:43.255 --> 05:46.189
Go bananas! Go, go bananas!

05:48.126 --> 05:51.194
What fresh fruit-themed hell
have you brought me to?

05:51.246 --> 05:54.080
- I'm out.
- Tucker, come on.

05:54.116 --> 05:56.483
It's a great way for
us to challenge ourselves.

05:56.518 --> 05:58.351
Plus, it's non-refundable.

05:58.387 --> 06:00.387
Come on in, guys, don't be shy.

06:00.389 --> 06:02.372
I'm Stanley, your fearless guide

06:02.407 --> 06:05.225
to the wonderful world of improvisation.

06:05.260 --> 06:07.327
In just one week, you'll learn

06:07.362 --> 06:09.346
to talk your way out of any situation.

06:09.381 --> 06:13.183
Oh, cool. Can I get a
refund on this improv class?

06:13.218 --> 06:14.267
Cute.

06:14.302 --> 06:16.269
Okay, everybody, we need to warm up

06:16.321 --> 06:18.204
our instruments, all right?

06:18.206 --> 06:21.508
You're a slice of bacon, now sizzle!

06:24.229 --> 06:25.815
(giggles)

06:26.515 --> 06:28.031
Are you kidding me?

06:28.083 --> 06:30.400
How is being bacon
gonna help me be a weatherman?

06:30.435 --> 06:32.485
God, Tucker, come on, just try it.

06:32.521 --> 06:37.474
This bacon is
guilty... of being delicious!

06:37.526 --> 06:39.359
I already feel like a better lawyer.

06:39.411 --> 06:42.429
Nice sizzle. Oh, come on... more sizzle.

06:42.464 --> 06:44.397
More. Just sizzle!

06:44.449 --> 06:47.300
Oh, you're in a pan and
you're sizzling bacon!

06:47.352 --> 06:49.352
Good. Even more!

06:51.356 --> 06:54.274
I am so impressed with you
boys owning your own bar.

06:54.326 --> 06:56.711
I hope you set a limit on free drinks

06:56.869 --> 07:00.063
or somebody here is gonna
gluggity glugg you right out of business.

07:00.098 --> 07:03.483
- Am I right?
- (Danny and Ben laugh)

07:05.153 --> 07:06.386
Ooh, oh, and what's that?

07:06.421 --> 07:08.021
You just carry that around

07:08.056 --> 07:10.323
in the off chance you
might need to strip paint?

07:10.375 --> 07:11.341
Huh?

07:13.361 --> 07:17.313
I am a sipper. Oh, add a
"T" and an "R" to that,

07:17.349 --> 07:19.249
and we have your mother's first job.

07:19.284 --> 07:22.368
Mom... you were a sippsterr?

07:22.404 --> 07:25.188
Stripper, Danny. Mom was a stripper...

07:25.223 --> 07:27.040
Mom, you were a stripper?

07:27.075 --> 07:29.209
No! I was a model.

07:29.244 --> 07:31.111
For who? Planned Parenthood?

07:32.497 --> 07:34.097
Now, where's the ladies'?

07:34.132 --> 07:36.099
Not sittin' here.

07:36.151 --> 07:38.501
Right that way, Nana, take your time.

07:38.537 --> 07:42.088
Whoa, she's just like you! I
always wanted a second mom.

07:42.124 --> 07:44.040
Now it's okay if we break one.

07:44.092 --> 07:47.360
Please... I am nothing like my mother.

07:47.412 --> 07:49.345
You're right. She gives us stuff.

07:49.397 --> 07:51.247
Other than a bad time.

07:51.283 --> 07:53.544
Look, just make it through this
lunch, and you'll be done for the day.

07:53.545 --> 07:56.069
Nana's grabbing Emma from
preschool and taking her shopping.

07:56.104 --> 07:58.304
What? You can't leave that
woman alone with Emma.

07:58.340 --> 08:02.041
Unless you think "How I
got to Third Base with Sinatra"

08:02.077 --> 08:04.010
is an appropriate
story for a two-year-old.

08:04.012 --> 08:05.605
It's not.

08:06.047 --> 08:08.031
And what's a "sippsterr"?

08:08.066 --> 08:09.315
What's a Sinatra?

08:15.407 --> 08:20.243
Next stop, fourth
floor... handbags and old bags.

08:20.295 --> 08:23.279
For the love of God, Mother, the
girls are out of the barn. Zip up.

08:23.315 --> 08:25.248
- (elevator bell dings)
- Hold my purse.

08:28.203 --> 08:32.038
Mom? Mom? Mom?

08:35.143 --> 08:38.061
Now you decide to answer my prayers?

08:38.096 --> 08:40.413
I'm gonna get blamed for this, aren't I?

08:43.390 --> 08:45.983
I don't understand. How
do you lose an entire person?

08:45.985 --> 08:48.025
She lost me in the
grocery store when I was 10.

08:48.061 --> 08:51.323
And accidentally drove
off with a 20-year-old.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.833
You guys were exactly the same size.

08:55.885 --> 08:57.869
Well, you need to call
the store and find her.

08:57.904 --> 09:00.822
I did! I also went
to the lost and found,

09:00.857 --> 09:03.708
and was very specific about
what I was looking for.

09:03.743 --> 09:06.677
About yay big, no soul, smells like gin,

09:06.730 --> 09:08.696
repelled by garlic, has no shadow,

09:08.748 --> 09:11.599
answers to "Hey, old bitch!"

09:11.651 --> 09:13.985
Don't worry, she will call eventually.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.921
With what? You have
her purse and her phone.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.907
Oh, you did this on purpose because
you're jealous of her.

09:19.943 --> 09:22.894
She's honing in on your
grandma territory and Emma loves her.

09:22.946 --> 09:24.979
Jealous? Of what?

09:25.014 --> 09:27.047
She's a booze-soaked bottle blonde who's

09:27.072 --> 09:28.733
never met a man she couldn't bed

09:28.735 --> 09:30.868
or a bar she couldn't close down.

09:30.870 --> 09:33.821
Wait, who are we talking about again?

09:33.873 --> 09:37.642
Wait, guys, I really think we're
nailing this improv thing.

09:37.694 --> 09:39.694
Quick, give me an
occupation and a location.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.045
You're an annoying
roommate with bad timing.

09:41.097 --> 09:44.615
Got it. I'm Ben. I work at a bar,

09:44.651 --> 09:47.018
and I make all my
friends babysit my kid.

09:47.070 --> 09:49.654
Dude, that was spot on.

09:49.689 --> 09:51.923
Maybe we should go work
on our scenes, like...

09:51.925 --> 09:53.991
let's write some
amazing stuff to ad lib.

09:56.568 --> 09:58.045
Seriously, they own the joint.

09:58.081 --> 10:01.966
So, drink up, Hanky, and
then we'll get to the panky.

10:03.953 --> 10:05.837
My god, there you are.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.772
I was so worried about you.

10:07.807 --> 10:10.758
Worried, casket shopping... same thing.

10:10.794 --> 10:13.611
Hey, guys, pull up a chair.

10:13.663 --> 10:17.098
This is my new friend, Hank.
Hank, these are my sons,

10:17.133 --> 10:18.783
and this is my older sister.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.084
Be cool.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.050
Okay, let's grab a suggestion from the

10:26.075 --> 10:28.016
hat and see where this scene takes us.

10:31.097 --> 10:33.064
Hey. Ah!

10:33.099 --> 10:37.869
The location is the WNY-8 weather desk.

10:37.871 --> 10:40.788
You guys, this is a good one.

10:40.824 --> 10:42.723
This feels fresh.

10:42.759 --> 10:44.725
Okay, guys, improvise!

10:48.715 --> 10:52.066
What are the chances that a weatherman
would need a lawyer?

10:52.101 --> 10:56.037
I murdered my co-worker Pamela
for talking too much.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.973
Well, perhaps I can
help you win your case,

10:59.008 --> 11:00.908
because I'm an amazing attorney.

11:00.944 --> 11:02.977
Stop! Stop, stop.

11:03.012 --> 11:05.863
Did you two actually
pre-write your scene?

11:05.899 --> 11:08.733
Yeah, how else are we supposed
to make it good?

11:09.886 --> 11:12.653
Perhaps missing the point.

11:12.689 --> 11:14.705
Let's try something else.

11:14.707 --> 11:17.108
You two start a scene, and
when you hear the bell,

11:17.143 --> 11:18.761
whoever spoke last has to change

11:18.786 --> 11:20.094
- what they said...
- (dings)

11:20.129 --> 11:21.729
- has to come up with something new...
- (dings)

11:21.781 --> 11:23.698
- has to alter their lines.
- (dings)

11:23.750 --> 11:25.700
I don't charge enough for these classes.

11:25.735 --> 11:27.018
Here we go.

11:28.087 --> 11:30.938
The location... the moon.

11:30.990 --> 11:31.989
Did you say "courtroom"?

11:32.041 --> 11:34.008
Moon! Go.

11:34.060 --> 11:38.996
Um, uh, don't open the
hatch or we'll die!

11:39.032 --> 11:42.800
I can't believe you ate the
manual, and we can't fly home!

11:42.835 --> 11:44.819
- (dings)
- What? That was a great line.

11:44.854 --> 11:46.837
You have to do a new
line when the bell rings.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.773
Yeah, but my line was good, hers sucked.

11:48.808 --> 11:50.708
- Make her do another line.
- (bell dings)

11:50.760 --> 11:52.109
- Oh, that's how we playing it?
- (bell dings)

11:52.145 --> 11:54.078
- Ring it again. I dare you.
- (rings bell)

12:00.904 --> 12:03.955
I remember doing this with
your mom when she was a little girl.

12:03.990 --> 12:06.791
Well, then, I
must've had a secret sister,

12:06.826 --> 12:08.926
because you sure as
hell aren't talking about me!

12:08.962 --> 12:12.747
Hi, Emma. Ready to
take your family picture?

12:12.782 --> 12:15.733
Gosh, you can see how much she
really loves her grandma.

12:15.768 --> 12:16.734
Great-grandma.

12:16.769 --> 12:17.835
Actually not great, just old.

12:17.870 --> 12:21.055
Not really grandma,
either. More like an acquaintance.

12:21.107 --> 12:23.758
Let's just call her Old
Lady Acquaintance.

12:23.793 --> 12:25.676
- Let me hold her.
- I was holding her.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.628
Okay, how about we just let go
of the innocent baby, all right?

12:27.664 --> 12:28.779
I'm the grandmother.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.965
- I'm the great-grandmother.
- You heard him, let go.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.984
I don't want to let... oh!

12:34.037 --> 12:36.020
Oh my god! Nana Lyle, are you okay?

12:36.072 --> 12:38.990
It's Family Day, for God's
sake, can't you just keep it together?

12:39.025 --> 12:40.875
Me? What about her?

12:40.910 --> 12:44.929
Well... obviously, I'm
not wanted by my own family.

12:44.964 --> 12:48.666
But that's all
right... I'm just a poor old lady

12:48.718 --> 12:51.652
who hasn't been feeling very well
lately and doesn't have much time.

12:51.704 --> 12:54.639
- You're dying?
- No, my plane leaves tomorrow.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.708
- Nana, wait!
- But...

13:00.980 --> 13:02.613
What are you lookin' at, Parker?

13:02.665 --> 13:05.255
Like you've never seen an old
lady get her ass kicked before?

13:08.020 --> 13:11.857
It's fine. I'll just go
back home where I'm wanted.

13:11.858 --> 13:13.514
But we all want you here, all of us.

13:13.549 --> 13:14.532
Every single one of us.

13:14.567 --> 13:17.301
- Tell her, Danny.
- Yep. Totally. All of us.

13:17.336 --> 13:21.255
For sure, 100 percent. Just not Mom.

13:21.307 --> 13:23.283
You know, I've just learned to laugh

13:23.308 --> 13:25.259
at all her craziness, so it's okay.

13:25.294 --> 13:27.278
I'll wait 'til it
passes, it always does.

13:27.313 --> 13:28.362
Now I'll go say goodbye to Emma.

13:28.397 --> 13:31.265
Oh, I wanna tell her my
Sinatra story before I leave.

13:33.341 --> 13:35.622
I don't know what's so hard
about being nice to the person

13:35.655 --> 13:37.671
who gave you life. Mom's such as ass.

13:39.575 --> 13:43.427
Okay... so what if I'm a
lawyer who stuck in a washing machine,

13:43.479 --> 13:44.578
and I have to argue my way out?

13:44.614 --> 13:48.432
'Ello, matey. Care for a dryer sheet?

13:49.753 --> 13:51.352
I just ad-libbed all of that.

13:51.387 --> 13:52.469
(Tucker laughs) Yes.

13:52.505 --> 13:55.372
Hey, don't forget about our
performance tonight, guys.

13:55.408 --> 13:57.708
It's completely free, but
there's a two-drink minimum.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.528
Also, admission is 10 bucks. You know, I

13:59.553 --> 14:01.320
don't even know why I said it was free.

14:03.649 --> 14:06.200
You know what, Danny? That's the answer.

14:06.202 --> 14:08.519
We just need to get Mom
and Nana in one place,

14:08.554 --> 14:10.504
and get them calm enough to
have an honest conversation.

14:10.556 --> 14:12.456
And they'll find a
way to laugh it all off.

14:12.491 --> 14:13.607
Okay, you take Mom and I'll take Nana.

14:13.659 --> 14:16.126
- Why do I always get Mom?
- Because you're her favorite.

14:16.278 --> 14:17.478
I didn't know you knew.

14:19.465 --> 14:22.349
I always assumed, but
now I know for sure.

14:22.385 --> 14:23.384
I'm tired of being her favorite.

14:23.386 --> 14:25.336
I know, but I've
worked really hard not to be.

14:31.394 --> 14:32.676
Danny.

14:32.728 --> 14:37.565
Wait a second. This isn't a free,
all-you-can-drink wine tasting.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.567
What are you doing here?

14:39.569 --> 14:41.569
What is she doing here? You
said she wasn't coming.

14:41.587 --> 14:44.471
What? Like it's the first
time somebody was manipulated

14:44.523 --> 14:46.407
into being in the same room as you?

14:46.492 --> 14:47.558
How is Dad, by the way?

14:49.395 --> 14:52.379
Well, I for one, think we are
all gonna laugh about this one day.

14:52.431 --> 14:54.448
Soon. Hopefully real soon.

14:54.500 --> 14:58.269
Hey, what do you say we all go
out for a drink after this,

14:58.304 --> 15:00.354
and have a nice chat?
Who's in? I know I am.

15:00.389 --> 15:02.256
Oh, look, the show's starting.

15:02.308 --> 15:04.068
(applause)

15:06.279 --> 15:10.664
Thank you. And welcome, family
and friends, to our student showcase.

15:10.666 --> 15:13.568
My name is Stanley Dexenberry,

15:13.593 --> 15:16.470
though I'm quite sure all
of you already know me...

15:16.472 --> 15:20.474
thanks to my one-man show,
"Stanley Dexenberry, a One-Man Show."

15:22.511 --> 15:24.311
Thank you.

15:24.313 --> 15:29.350
Now, let's kick things
off with the Director's Cut.

15:29.352 --> 15:31.669
Can I have the name of a fairy tale?

15:31.704 --> 15:33.287
Oh, right here, I know...

15:33.289 --> 15:36.657
Cinderella. It's Riley's favorite.

15:36.709 --> 15:40.561
Now, because our students are
new, let's help them out

15:40.613 --> 15:42.630
and suggest characters for them to play.

15:42.665 --> 15:46.634
How about a cold, distant
mother, who never gave her daughter

15:46.669 --> 15:47.668
a moment of support?

15:47.703 --> 15:50.587
So the actual character from Cinderella.

15:52.491 --> 15:53.474
And for Riley?

15:53.509 --> 15:55.509
How about an ungrateful daughter,

15:55.544 --> 15:59.313
who's always upset about
something stupid and meaningless?

15:59.365 --> 16:02.249
Why do I even try?

16:02.301 --> 16:05.386
Okay, guys, let's improvise!

16:08.290 --> 16:10.591
All I wanna do is go to the ball,

16:10.643 --> 16:12.209
and you won't let me.

16:12.244 --> 16:14.545
I should probably get a lawyer.

16:15.731 --> 16:19.166
The last time you went to
a ball, you came home drunk

16:19.218 --> 16:21.418
and barfed in my car.

16:21.454 --> 16:22.569
But tomorrow the sun will come out,

16:22.621 --> 16:24.455
and it should be in the low 70s.

16:25.641 --> 16:28.425
It sure is nice to be
spending time with the family.

16:28.461 --> 16:31.278
Something I wasn't allowed to do before.

16:31.330 --> 16:33.213
- Here we go.
- Here we go where?

16:33.265 --> 16:35.349
Here we go rewriting history.

16:35.384 --> 16:39.219
Honestly, Bonnie, I have
done nothing but support you.

16:39.271 --> 16:41.338
All I've ever wanted is
to be part of this family.

16:41.374 --> 16:43.323
I love the boys, I love Emma,

16:43.376 --> 16:45.592
I just don't know what your problem is.

16:45.644 --> 16:47.695
Uh-huh. My problem?

16:47.697 --> 16:51.699
You don't know what my problem is?

16:51.734 --> 16:53.584
Well... here's a hint.

16:53.636 --> 16:55.436
It's you.

16:56.572 --> 16:59.473
You think you supported and loved me?

16:59.475 --> 17:01.408
When? How?

17:01.444 --> 17:05.445
Yes, mother, I got
pregnant when I was 17,

17:05.481 --> 17:08.382
not exactly the highlight of homecoming.

17:08.416 --> 17:11.435
But I did the best I
could for a terrified teenager.

17:11.487 --> 17:15.622
And what did you, my mother, do? Hmm?

17:15.674 --> 17:17.357
You threw me out of the house.

17:17.393 --> 17:20.627
Thankfully, Ray's family took me in.

17:20.628 --> 17:23.564
But even that wasn't
enough for you, was it?

17:23.616 --> 17:24.233
I've had enough.

17:24.234 --> 17:26.215
Oh, I am just getting
started, old woman.

17:26.252 --> 17:29.603
You didn't come to my wedding,

17:29.638 --> 17:31.588
because you said I was an embarrassment.

17:31.624 --> 17:34.541
And then you simply disowned me.

17:34.577 --> 17:39.346
Oh, I believe your words
were, "You don't have a mother."

17:40.416 --> 17:44.301
You refused to see
Danny until he was four.

17:44.336 --> 17:46.437
And then when Ben
came along, you told me

17:46.472 --> 17:50.207
that I was ruining my
life, and adding another dumbo

17:50.242 --> 17:52.309
to an already stupid family tree.

17:52.344 --> 17:57.681
Oh, but the true icing on the
crap cake was what you said to me

17:57.716 --> 18:02.469
when I told you that Ben was a
father to a beautiful little girl.

18:02.505 --> 18:04.588
Do you remember that
lovely letter you sent, Ma?

18:04.623 --> 18:07.374
Huh? "The rotten apple

18:07.426 --> 18:09.560
"doesn't fall far from the rotten tree.

18:09.612 --> 18:13.497
He's a dummy... just like his mommy."

18:13.549 --> 18:17.451
So guess what, you cold, heartless,

18:17.503 --> 18:20.354
liquor-filled excuse for a mother?

18:20.389 --> 18:23.407
You don't get to have this
family. It is mine!

18:25.000 --> 18:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18:33.302 --> 18:36.220
Can we take a five? I'm
gonna call my mother.

18:39.708 --> 18:42.676
Mom. I'm sorry, we had no idea.

18:42.678 --> 18:44.461
Why didn't you tell us?

18:44.497 --> 18:46.480
I didn't want you to know.

18:46.515 --> 18:48.382
What about all the
cards and letters she sent us?

18:48.434 --> 18:49.483
I sent them.

18:51.403 --> 18:54.438
I was just trying to
protect you from her.

18:54.490 --> 18:58.275
And you did. I am so sorry.

18:58.310 --> 19:00.277
You deserve a great mom,

19:00.312 --> 19:01.428
because you've always been one to us.

19:01.463 --> 19:05.332
And don't worry about Nana
Lyle. We don't need her.

19:05.367 --> 19:10.270
Look... I know I'm not perfect,
but I did the best that I could.

19:10.306 --> 19:12.289
I didn't know how to raise kids.

19:12.324 --> 19:15.642
Yeah, well... I
didn't either. Right, boys?

19:15.678 --> 19:17.194
- The worst, absolutely terrible.
- No idea.

19:17.229 --> 19:18.529
Okay.

19:18.581 --> 19:22.566
Look... I am gonna
try to be the perfect nana

19:22.601 --> 19:25.619
to Emma, and put
family first from now on.

19:25.671 --> 19:28.522
- (phone rings)
- Oops. That's me.

19:31.493 --> 19:34.394
Hey, Hanky Panky.

19:34.430 --> 19:36.513
No, I'm not doing anything important.

19:36.549 --> 19:38.498
See you in 20.

19:40.419 --> 19:44.421
Well... this was a really good
talk. I'll see you folks at home.

19:48.544 --> 19:50.544
You were right, Mom.

19:50.546 --> 19:54.514
You're nothing like Nana
Lyle. We love you.

19:54.550 --> 19:56.550
I love you both. So much.

20:00.556 --> 20:03.523
Hey, should we go back inside?

20:03.559 --> 20:05.559
- Get out! Never come back!
- (bell dinging)

20:05.561 --> 20:09.396
No refunds! You fail!

20:10.616 --> 20:13.317
I'll take that drink now.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.316
I'm Tucker Dobbs.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.730
And in rain, sleet, snow or hail,

20:18.732 --> 20:21.161
count on me, your weather male.

20:21.163 --> 20:23.985
(laughs) I just improvised that!

20:24.097 --> 20:26.682
- Back to you, Pamela!
- Thanks, Tucker.

20:26.823 --> 20:29.043
And that is all that
we have time for tonight...

20:29.233 --> 20:32.166
Whoa! Whoa, whoa
whoa, hold up now, Pamela.

20:32.298 --> 20:33.873
What about a little chit chat?

20:33.874 --> 20:36.483
Some witty banter, some
ad libs, repartee?

20:36.485 --> 20:37.722
Come on, now, hit me with a question.

20:37.766 --> 20:40.466
I'm sorry, we're literally out of time.

20:40.496 --> 20:41.605
Out of time?

20:41.606 --> 20:43.481
How is that even
possible? We're never out of...

20:43.482 --> 20:44.986
(high-pitched tone)
