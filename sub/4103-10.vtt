00:08.570 --> 00:09.832
Hello, emma.

00:09.840 --> 00:11.330
Emma:
Pre wous/y on
screa m. . .

00:11.340 --> 00:15.572
We have a pervert
watching me undress
on my webcam.

00:15.580 --> 00:19.368
Your mom had a baby
with brandon james?

00:19.880 --> 00:21.609
Mr. Branson
has to be the killer.

00:21.620 --> 00:23.144
Kieran:
I drove her home.

00:23.150 --> 00:24.048
And then she was murdered.

00:24.050 --> 00:26.280
And I showed her his picture,
cassie pointed out kieran.

00:26.290 --> 00:29.953
He is the only person
who would've wanted
hergone.

00:29.960 --> 00:31.723
(everyone screaming)

00:37.130 --> 00:39.462
(people clamoring)

00:46.580 --> 00:48.275
Mom? What's going on?

00:48.280 --> 00:49.201
Seth branson escaped.

00:49.210 --> 00:50.973
There's an officer
dead on the scene.

00:50.980 --> 00:51.639
Oh, my god.

00:51.650 --> 00:53.049
They think
the crime scene
looks staged.

00:53.050 --> 00:55.917
Stay here, okay?
Mom, I'm coming
with you.

00:55.920 --> 00:57.888
No. You stay
here, okay?

00:57.890 --> 01:00.279
You're safer here with
all these deputies.

01:01.220 --> 01:01.914
(sighs)

01:01.920 --> 01:03.979
Emma, is
your mom okay?

01:03.990 --> 01:06.288
No, she's definitely
not okay.

01:07.660 --> 01:08.422
(grunting)

01:08.430 --> 01:09.852
Why would mr. Branson
do this?

01:09.870 --> 01:12.566
Maybe to get
the police distracted
looking for the sheriff

01:12.570 --> 01:13.594
Instead of looking
for him.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.262
I'm gonna go to the station
and see what I can find out.

01:16.270 --> 01:19.307
Be careful. And
don't trust anyone.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.038
(sighs)

01:27.120 --> 01:29.213
(cell phone ringing)

01:37.660 --> 01:41.756
Kieran, uh, look,
I don't know if you know,

01:41.760 --> 01:44.194
But branson escaped, and

01:44.730 --> 01:46.823
Your dad's in trouble.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.735
Look, I don't know
what to believe.

01:48.740 --> 01:51.038
Just please
call me back, okay?

01:57.550 --> 01:58.608
Noah”.

01:58.610 --> 01:59.702
I just heard
that branson's...

01:59.720 --> 02:02.974
Yeah, I heard.
One of those rare moments
where I hate being right.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.241
We have to find
the sheriff.

02:04.250 --> 02:05.512
I think I can
help with that.

02:05.520 --> 02:06.589
Whoever hacked
the big screen

02:06.590 --> 02:08.751
Is sending a live signal
through my av system.

02:08.760 --> 02:10.910
Can you trace it?
I'm working on it.

02:10.930 --> 02:12.989
Hey, have you
heard froum brooke?
o.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.080
'cause I can't
reach audrey.

02:14.100 --> 02:16.398
They may not even
know what's going on.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.651
Oh, no.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.626
(breathing heavily)

02:21.970 --> 02:24.029
(hip hop music playing)

02:28.480 --> 02:31.802
Where the hell are
my actual friends?

02:33.950 --> 02:36.248
She's not answering.

02:45.590 --> 02:49.253
(sighs) why isn't she
answering her texts?

02:51.930 --> 02:53.659
(sighs)

02:54.840 --> 02:56.899
(cell phone ringing)

03:06.380 --> 03:06.971
Hello?

03:06.980 --> 03:10.575
/(/7/er.'
Hello, emma.
Enjoying the dance?

03:11.450 --> 03:12.747
Let him go, okay?

03:12.760 --> 03:14.512
This is about you and me.

03:14.520 --> 03:15.612
Oh, I don’t think so.

03:15.620 --> 03:17.178
Ton/'ghtis the big
ﬁnale, emma.

03:17.190 --> 03:20.648
Gotta make sure
eve/yhoo'y’s watching
the horror show.

03:20.660 --> 03:23.493
People wanna see blooo;
and I ’m gonna give it to em.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.353
I'm gonna find him.

03:24.370 --> 03:27.794
And then I'm gonna find you,
you sick son of a bitch.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.358
Then lets see what
you ’Ve learneo; emma.

03:29.370 --> 03:32.305
Can you put all
the pieces together
in time to save h/m?

03:32.310 --> 03:36.770
0r wﬂl o'aisyis heart
be broken the way
she broke brandon is?

03:36.780 --> 03:37.530
Its up to you.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.279
But I can promise
you one thing,

03:39.280 --> 03:42.818
Its gonna be
gut-wrenching.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.953
(grunts)
(all exclaiming)

03:55.330 --> 03:57.195
(all screaming)

04:06.040 --> 04:08.406
The killer called.
He said that tonight's
the big finale.

04:08.410 --> 04:12.972
Of course he did.
A big ill-advised
Halloween dance.

04:12.980 --> 04:13.901
We have to find the sheriff.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.048
I'm trying, but all my
serious gear is back
at the shop.

04:17.050 --> 04:18.415
Okay, well, let's go. Now.

04:18.420 --> 04:19.910
Yeah.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.551
Sorry, guys,
nobody leaves.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.788
We need to go to
the station now

04:23.790 --> 04:25.724
Or the sheriff
is going to die.

04:26.060 --> 04:28.051
I'd listen to her.

04:39.340 --> 04:40.932
(sighs)

04:46.780 --> 04:48.509
You can take him down.

04:52.020 --> 04:53.715
Mom! Mom!

04:53.720 --> 04:55.756
Emma, I told you to
stay at the dance.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.057
Mom, the killer
just called.

04:57.060 --> 04:59.858
He said unless I put
the pieces together fast

04:59.860 --> 05:02.055
He's gonna break
daisy's heart.

05:02.060 --> 05:02.958
Oh, my god.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.028
He's gonna kill clark.

05:04.030 --> 05:06.464
No, not if we can
find what he wants.

05:06.470 --> 05:09.291
You said that
the deputy's body
looks staged, right?

05:09.310 --> 05:13.929
When he took will,
he carved a clue
onto his back.

05:16.550 --> 05:19.542
Wait. (sighs) I need
to see him.

05:31.390 --> 05:33.722
There's something
in his mouth.

05:34.060 --> 05:36.255
(squelching)

05:51.150 --> 05:53.675
Oh, my god.
What is that?

05:55.550 --> 05:57.848
(sighs) oh, god.

05:58.190 --> 05:59.612
Brandon made it for me.

05:59.620 --> 06:00.382
(breath quivering)

06:00.390 --> 06:04.611
He used to leave me gifts
in the tree behind my house.

06:04.630 --> 06:06.279
Mom...

06:06.500 --> 06:08.991
What if that's
where clark is?

06:09.430 --> 06:11.694
(hip hop music playing)

06:20.210 --> 06:21.632
(screams)

06:21.640 --> 06:22.675
Ugh,god!
Gaughs)

06:22.680 --> 06:24.329
Oh, man, brooke, you
should've seen your face.

06:24.350 --> 06:25.146
You were like...

06:25.150 --> 06:27.903
(imitates brooke screaming)
god! It was priceless.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.047
Grayson, you are such a tool.
(chuckles)

06:30.050 --> 06:31.244
Where did you get that?

06:31.250 --> 06:32.319
Uh, some sick chick on etsy.

06:32.320 --> 06:37.155
She jacked up the price
for Halloween, but it
was so worth it!

06:37.160 --> 06:40.152
Well, now it's mine, so...

06:49.440 --> 06:52.034
Audrey? Hey.

06:52.910 --> 06:55.435
Did not expect
to see you here.

06:55.440 --> 06:57.874
That makes two of us.

06:58.450 --> 06:59.974
Nice mask.

06:59.980 --> 07:02.244
Big plans later?
(chuckles)

07:02.480 --> 07:03.469
It's tempting.

07:03.490 --> 07:07.085
I mean, some psycho
wears this to
kill our friends,

07:07.090 --> 07:09.581
And people treat
it like it's a joke.

07:09.590 --> 07:12.479
That's because
people generally suck.

07:12.490 --> 07:15.220
I know. Even
the ones I like.

07:16.100 --> 07:18.318
Emma bailed on me,
jake spied on me

07:18.330 --> 07:23.461
And everyone else,
well, they're gone, so...

07:23.470 --> 07:28.305
Looks like you're
officially my favorite
person at this party.

07:28.310 --> 07:32.269
So not exactly a banner day
in the maddox household.

07:32.510 --> 07:34.068
Nope.

07:35.220 --> 07:39.384
So, uh, what brings
you to my pity party?

07:39.390 --> 07:41.142
I found something
that looks like

07:41.160 --> 07:43.048
Emma might be sleeping
with the enemy,

07:43.060 --> 07:44.357
But she didn't
want to hear it.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.783
And I didn't
want to see it.

07:47.330 --> 07:47.785
No.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.689
Kieran can't be
the killer.
He's too pretty.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.668
Although I guess
ted bundy kinda proved

07:52.670 --> 07:55.696
That hotness doesn't
cancel out crazy.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.236
True.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.868
I just don't wanna
see her get hurt.

07:59.880 --> 08:00.403
I know.

08:00.410 --> 08:03.868
You're just
looking out for her.
It's what friends do.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.605
Or, at least,
they should do.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.878
You know, I kind of
like this whole

08:08.880 --> 08:11.713
Real human thing you
got going right now.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.210
(chuckles)

08:13.220 --> 08:14.187
Are you flirting with me?

08:14.190 --> 08:16.852
Oh, you wish.
(laughs)

08:18.160 --> 08:20.549
Hey, look at us bonding.

08:20.560 --> 08:21.424
Chicks before dicks.

08:21.430 --> 08:23.193
Oh, let's not
get crazy.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.497
(chuckles)
jake: Oh, snap.

08:24.500 --> 08:29.767
Just_in time_ for the hot
gIrl-on-glrl action.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.567
Speaking of clicks...

08:31.570 --> 08:34.505
Jake, I don't remember
inviting you to the party.

08:34.510 --> 08:36.068
Oh, come on, brooke.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.207
I think the jake
is the party.

08:38.210 --> 08:39.677
Can I get an "amen"?

08:39.680 --> 08:42.171
(all cheering) amen!

08:42.180 --> 08:43.841
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

08:43.850 --> 08:45.738
(siren wailing)

08:53.630 --> 08:55.188
(panting) mom!

08:55.200 --> 08:57.657
Oh, my god.
Over here!

08:58.170 --> 08:59.569
Okay. Clark.

08:59.570 --> 09:00.798
Clark, it's maggie.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.859
Untie him!
Can you hear me?

09:02.870 --> 09:04.337
(grunting faintly)
it's okay.

09:04.340 --> 09:05.602
We're here.
We got you.

09:05.610 --> 09:06.907
It's okay. Okay?

09:06.910 --> 09:08.400
Sorry I missed
the dance.

09:08.410 --> 09:09.832
Maggie: (chuckles)
don't you worry.

09:09.850 --> 09:13.342
You're gonna be
taking me to a lot
of dances, okay? Shh.

09:13.350 --> 09:14.806
Give me those.
Maggie.

09:14.820 --> 09:16.776
Okay, hold on,
honey. Hold on.

09:16.790 --> 09:17.575
Hudson: Maggie...

09:17.590 --> 09:18.784
It's all right.
I got you.

09:18.790 --> 09:20.439
Maggie, something's
not right.

09:20.460 --> 09:23.315
Maggie...
It's okay. It's okay.

09:23.530 --> 09:24.758
(maggie gasps)
(gasps) oh, my god!

09:24.760 --> 09:27.581
(squelches)
maggie: Oh, my god!
No, no, no!

09:27.600 --> 09:29.249
No, no... Get help!

09:29.260 --> 09:30.591
Stay with me!
Stay with me!

09:30.600 --> 09:34.388
(crying) oh, god,
please stay with me.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.992
No...

09:36.000 --> 09:38.366
(gasps)

09:50.020 --> 09:52.488
Emma: Mom, I'm so sorry.

09:52.490 --> 09:54.048
Maggie: I did this.

09:54.620 --> 09:56.656
I should've checked
him more carefully.

09:56.660 --> 09:58.059
Maybe I could've
stabilized him.

09:58.060 --> 10:01.951
Mom, the emt said
that there was nothing
that you could've done.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.894
The bastard just
kept him alive

10:03.900 --> 10:06.368
So he could watch
me try to save him.

10:07.240 --> 10:07.899
I know.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.663
And then he
had me kill him.

10:09.670 --> 10:13.162
I know. Just like will.

10:13.510 --> 10:15.000
(sighs)

10:21.950 --> 10:25.215
Mom, we can't
let him win.

10:27.260 --> 10:30.081
No, we can't.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.582
(sighs)
you need to tell kieran.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.898
He can't find out
about this on the news.

10:35.900 --> 10:37.788
Okay. I'll find him.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.598
And then I'll find
the psycho who did this.

10:40.600 --> 10:41.498
No, you won't.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.661
We're ready
to move him.

10:43.670 --> 10:44.932
Okay.

10:44.940 --> 10:45.929
I'm gonna go with dark.

10:45.940 --> 10:48.067
I'm gonna have a deputy
take you to the station.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.004
You wait right
over there for him.

10:52.210 --> 10:56.010
Hey, I'll see you there.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.278
Okay.

10:58.590 --> 11:01.115
(emma breathing heavily)

11:04.030 --> 11:05.349
Emma.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.918
Piper, I can't
talk right now.

11:06.930 --> 11:07.954
No, I don't want you to.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.793
I mean, after what
you just saw...

11:11.030 --> 11:13.726
Anything you need,
I wanna help.

11:13.740 --> 11:17.369
I have to go to the
station with my mom.

11:17.370 --> 11:18.268
I can't reach brooke.

11:18.270 --> 11:20.864
A deputy went to her party,
but I haven't heard anything.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.701
I'll go check, okay?
You don't worry.

11:23.710 --> 11:27.146
Thank you.
Be careful.

11:27.550 --> 11:29.108
You, too.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.712
(sighs)

11:36.790 --> 11:40.988
First he spies on
me, then he shows
up with her.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.649
Men are pigs.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.059
True.

11:44.070 --> 11:44.855
(brooke sighs)

11:44.870 --> 11:47.464
She's literally
dumb as toast.

11:47.470 --> 11:49.961
Brooke, it's obvious
he has nothing for her

11:49.970 --> 11:51.904
Except the rise
it gets out of you.

11:51.910 --> 11:57.132
Yeah, well, I've been known
to make things rise myself.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.643
Hey, board shorts!

12:07.660 --> 12:11.312
How would you like to
share one of the finest
wines out of bordeaux

12:11.330 --> 12:12.854
In the last half-century?

12:12.860 --> 12:13.781
(chuckles) yeah, sure.

12:13.800 --> 12:17.190
(chuckles) go
do some push-ups.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.366
Well played.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.598
Thank you.

12:26.610 --> 12:27.304
Do me a solid?

12:27.310 --> 12:30.677
Do not let the unwashed
masses into this house.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.201
Aye, aye, captain.
(brooke chuckles)

12:38.650 --> 12:42.518
Hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

12:43.090 --> 12:44.512
Hey. Hold up.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.225
Where do you think
you're going?
I gotta hit the head.

12:46.230 --> 12:50.394
You're soaking wet.
Hit the head in
the pool house.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.620
Whatever, bitch.

12:56.300 --> 13:00.566
Um, we have to stay
here to help with
the search, okay?

13:00.580 --> 13:03.834
Mom, is there anything
I can do for you?

13:03.850 --> 13:05.772
No... I'm okay.

13:05.780 --> 13:08.271
I'm gonna, um,
go get cleaned up.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.248
I'll be back.

13:18.430 --> 13:21.422
(cell phone ringing)

13:23.330 --> 13:23.955
Noah?

13:23.970 --> 13:25.267
Well, I’ve almost
isolated the signal.

13:25.270 --> 13:27.488
And I figured out why
we can't reach people.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.161
The malware doesn't
just access webcams.

13:29.170 --> 13:31.138
It turns off ringers
and notifications.

13:31.140 --> 13:33.301
So they don't even
know that we've been
trying to contact them.

13:33.310 --> 13:36.677
Oh, my god.
He's cutting us
off from everyone.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.432
Yeah, pretty much.

13:38.450 --> 13:40.270
Oh, yes. I got it!

13:40.280 --> 13:41.975
It's 1221 sparrow drive?

13:41.980 --> 13:44.119
(sighs) that's brooke's house.

13:44.320 --> 13:47.539
Wait, audrey and
jake are there, and I...

13:47.560 --> 13:50.120
I just sent piper over there
to check on them.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.825
Tell the cops we've got him.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.752
(cell phone beeps)

13:57.500 --> 13:58.865
Emma?

13:59.700 --> 14:00.689
Emma, do you hear me?

14:00.700 --> 14:04.693
Noah, pick me up
at the sheriff's
station right now.

14:05.010 --> 14:05.908
Noah: This is insane.

14:05.910 --> 14:07.639
We are willingly
driving alone

14:07.640 --> 14:10.700
Into certain danger
without a police escort.

14:10.710 --> 14:11.847
The cops can't help us.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.477
Really? Because
I'm pretty sure

14:13.480 --> 14:15.175
They've got,
like, big-ass guns

14:15.180 --> 14:16.977
And body armor
and swat teams.

14:16.990 --> 14:17.843
This is america.

14:17.850 --> 14:19.943
Noah, he said
no cops, okay?

14:19.960 --> 14:22.758
We have to finish
this ourselves.

14:23.690 --> 14:24.281
Okay.

14:24.290 --> 14:25.484
Well, if this is
the final showdown,

14:25.490 --> 14:26.787
The killer's gonna
try and take out

14:26.800 --> 14:28.188
Every single one
of your friends,

14:28.200 --> 14:31.351
One by one until you're
the only one that's left.

14:31.370 --> 14:34.021
Because you're
the survivor girl,

14:34.040 --> 14:37.089
Which makes me the
know-it—all sidekick.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.266
Oh, crap. I'm gonna die.

14:39.270 --> 14:41.500
You're not going to die!

14:42.780 --> 14:45.578
Tonight, we change
the ending.

14:59.490 --> 15:01.026
(gasps and sighs)

15:01.030 --> 15:01.758
Damn it, jake.

15:01.760 --> 15:06.163
Shouldn't you be
outside macking on your
low-rent olsen sister?

15:06.170 --> 15:07.762
Look, I don't wanna fight.

15:07.770 --> 15:09.533
I get jealous and
I say stupid things.

15:09.540 --> 15:14.466
So I am sorry for what I said
about you and your family.

15:15.180 --> 15:15.669
Okay.

15:15.680 --> 15:21.300
Well, then I'm sorry
I accused you
of spying on me.

15:21.850 --> 15:23.818
Full disclosure,
I kinda was.

15:23.820 --> 15:26.584
(scoffs) see, I knew it!

15:26.590 --> 15:27.841
I was looking out for you.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.157
You mean looking
out for my boobs?

15:29.160 --> 15:33.449
No, the spyware was
deleted and then
somebody put it back up.

15:33.460 --> 15:35.189
I was just trying
to figure out who.

15:35.200 --> 15:38.089
Okay, then,
why not just
tell me that, jake?

15:38.100 --> 15:40.398
Because I'm a jackass.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.398
And maybe I wanted
to see your boobs.

15:43.410 --> 15:46.106
I'm sure you've
seen plenty.

15:46.110 --> 15:48.305
Get out!

15:49.610 --> 15:51.134
Fine.

15:51.150 --> 15:52.902
(scoffs)

15:53.750 --> 15:54.671
(sighs)

15:54.680 --> 15:56.841
(pop music playing)

15:57.690 --> 15:59.681
Have you seen jake?

16:00.160 --> 16:01.912
That's a no.

16:04.860 --> 16:07.249
Jake, are you in there?

16:11.100 --> 16:12.920
(gasps) oh, my god.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.092
(screams)

16:15.740 --> 16:17.594
(all screaming)

16:20.910 --> 16:23.231
(all yelling)

16:23.850 --> 16:25.772
Wait. Where you going?

16:40.800 --> 16:44.258
(inhales sharply)
what are you waiting for?

16:49.100 --> 16:51.591
(dance music playing)

17:05.920 --> 17:07.649
What the...

17:08.660 --> 17:09.979
Audrey?

17:15.100 --> 17:16.590
Jake?

17:20.840 --> 17:22.432
Board shorts?

17:22.740 --> 17:25.561
Oh, my god.
They ditched me.

17:25.570 --> 17:27.265
(scoffs)

17:27.740 --> 17:29.776
I have officially
hit rock bottom.

17:29.780 --> 17:31.509
(rustling)

17:40.720 --> 17:42.585
Brooke! It's me.

17:42.590 --> 17:43.215
Seth?

17:43.220 --> 17:46.485
How did you...
(stutters) what
are you doing here?

17:46.690 --> 17:47.384
I was set up.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.096
Look, he was wearing a mask,
and he killed the guard
and he let me out.

17:50.100 --> 17:52.364
I knew how that was
gonna look, so I ran.

17:52.370 --> 17:53.723
You have to believe me.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.459
(breath trembling)
who set you up?

17:58.370 --> 18:00.304
I don't know.

18:00.510 --> 18:02.000
I didn't have
anywhere else to go.

18:02.010 --> 18:04.001
Will you just
please let me in?

18:04.010 --> 18:05.238
Where did everyone go?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.808
I don't know!

18:07.050 --> 18:09.518
Just listen
to me, okay?

18:11.920 --> 18:13.512
Brooke, this whole thing...

18:13.520 --> 18:15.249
This whole thing
is a mistake, okay?

18:15.260 --> 18:17.717
The night that you
came to the theater,
I was so,

18:17.730 --> 18:20.381
So damn happy to see you.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.924
I miss you.

18:21.930 --> 18:23.921
I miss what we've had.

18:23.930 --> 18:25.022
But whatever
they say about me,

18:25.030 --> 18:28.693
You have to know that
I would never hurt you.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.800
I don't even know
who you are.

18:32.810 --> 18:34.539
Yes, you do.

18:35.340 --> 18:37.001
All that stuff
that happened before,

18:37.010 --> 18:39.376
That has nothing
to do with us.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.510
Look, what we
had was special.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.272
Brooke,

18:44.290 --> 18:46.246
You're special to me.

18:49.090 --> 18:51.581
I wanna believe that,

18:53.500 --> 18:55.354
But I don't.

19:10.810 --> 19:13.904
Brooke, why won't
you let me in?

19:18.050 --> 19:19.711
(gasps)

19:23.060 --> 19:24.755
(exhales sharply)

19:26.190 --> 19:27.953
Seth?

19:30.930 --> 19:31.999
(gasps)

19:32.000 --> 19:34.423
(brooke gasping)
(door knob rattling)

19:38.740 --> 19:40.731
(panﬁng)

19:42.680 --> 19:44.898
(glass shattering)
(gasps)

19:50.450 --> 19:52.486
(breathing heavily)

20:19.280 --> 20:21.202
(whimpering)

20:25.790 --> 20:27.985
(breathing heavily)

20:31.190 --> 20:32.521
(gasps)

20:34.030 --> 20:35.520
(cries) oh, no.

20:35.530 --> 20:38.192
No! No, let me out!

20:38.200 --> 20:40.498
No, please. Let me out.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.195
Let me out! (screams)

20:43.610 --> 20:45.828
(panﬁng)

20:47.180 --> 20:49.034
(sobbing)

20:51.850 --> 20:55.172
(screaming and crying)

20:56.990 --> 20:59.140
(hyperventilating)

21:05.360 --> 21:07.089
(screams)

21:07.300 --> 21:09.598
(sobbing)

21:14.270 --> 21:15.897
(moaning)

21:17.310 --> 21:18.959
(freezer turns on)

21:18.970 --> 21:20.267
No.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.429
No!

21:21.440 --> 21:22.873
No!

21:24.050 --> 21:25.335
Let me out!

21:25.350 --> 21:28.376
Somebody help me!

21:29.680 --> 21:32.911
Are you sure this is
where the signal's
coming from?

21:32.920 --> 21:35.445
I'm pretty sure.

21:35.460 --> 21:36.950
Emma...

21:42.600 --> 21:44.625
(panting) oh, my god!

21:47.270 --> 21:47.998
It's piper.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.865
(breathing heavily)
I'm gonna throw up.

21:49.870 --> 21:52.759
Come on, let's
check the house.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.139
(floorboard creaking)

22:06.150 --> 22:08.084
(both breathing heavily)

22:26.640 --> 22:28.267
(both gasp)

22:34.050 --> 22:36.371
Emma, it's me.
Relax.

22:36.380 --> 22:37.972
Holding a gun.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.446
Just breathe.

22:39.450 --> 22:42.453
(breathing heavily)
why didn't you call me back?

22:42.460 --> 22:44.018
Well, I didn't
feel much like talking

22:44.030 --> 22:46.590
After you accused
me of murder.

22:46.790 --> 22:47.859
You wanna put
that down now?

22:47.860 --> 22:50.397
No, we don't
actually want to.

22:50.400 --> 22:53.494
(breathing heavily)
what are you doing here?

22:53.500 --> 22:56.094
You texted me
to meet you.

22:56.300 --> 22:57.198
No, I didn't.

22:57.210 --> 23:00.464
(scoffs) well,
I didn't send
this to myself.

23:01.410 --> 23:03.275
(breathing heavily)
unless you did.

23:03.280 --> 23:04.599
To convince you
he's trustworthy

23:04.610 --> 23:07.579
Because he's the one
controlling the malware.

23:08.650 --> 23:10.015
What happened to piper?

23:10.020 --> 23:12.113
I... I don't know.
I just got here.

23:12.120 --> 23:15.385
I saw her car and I
took a look around.

23:16.760 --> 23:19.149
(inhales sharply)
I really wanna believe you.

23:19.160 --> 23:20.320
Why would I hurt piper?

23:20.330 --> 23:25.029
Because she found
out that you might be
the son of brandon james.

23:25.030 --> 23:26.190
What?

23:26.200 --> 23:28.122
Yeah, what?

23:28.770 --> 23:30.795
We talked to cassie james.

23:30.810 --> 23:33.131
She said that her grandson
came to visit her

23:33.140 --> 23:34.539
And she identified you.

23:34.540 --> 23:36.770
And you believe her?

23:36.780 --> 23:39.146
I don't know
what to believe.

23:39.350 --> 23:41.079
Well, where were
you all night?

23:41.080 --> 23:43.344
I drove out to the
woods to be alone.

23:43.350 --> 23:44.715
I did a little
target practice,

23:44.720 --> 23:47.348
I got your text,
and I came here.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.210
As for brandon james,

23:49.220 --> 23:53.384
When my dad became
my guardian again, there
was a lot of paperwork.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.824
You can see it all for
yourself, it's at home.

23:55.830 --> 24:00.995
We may not be close,
but I'm pretty sure
he's the only dad I got.

24:01.370 --> 24:03.167
Oh, my god.

24:04.210 --> 24:05.802
You haven't heard?

24:05.810 --> 24:06.834
Heard what?

24:06.840 --> 24:08.364
Noah: Oh, man.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.576
What?

24:10.580 --> 24:12.673
Kieran. ..
(crying)

24:12.680 --> 24:14.898
...Your dad was attacked.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.842
He didn't make it.

24:17.390 --> 24:19.517
I'm so sorry.

24:22.190 --> 24:24.317
(kieran breathing heavily)

24:26.990 --> 24:30.391
We think he must have
found something and then...

24:30.400 --> 24:33.858
(sighs) and then,
the killer found him.

24:33.870 --> 24:37.192
My mom tried to save him,
but it was too late.

24:38.370 --> 24:40.531
Kieran: I can't
believe this.

24:41.440 --> 24:42.509
(breathing deeply)

24:42.510 --> 24:46.298
And you still think that
this psychopath could be me?

24:48.780 --> 24:52.511
_Take this and use it
if you don't trust me.

24:53.890 --> 24:55.289
Or help me find
this sick bastard

24:55.290 --> 24:57.611
Before he hurts anyone else.

24:57.630 --> 24:59.325
Sounds fair to me.

24:59.330 --> 25:01.321
(breathing heavily)

25:17.780 --> 25:20.248
Let's go find
everybody else.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.909
(upbeat pop music playing)

25:27.150 --> 25:28.947
Brooke?

25:30.290 --> 25:31.780
Jake?

25:33.430 --> 25:35.227
Audrey!

25:39.370 --> 25:43.067
Bubblegum pop
has never sounded
so terrifying.

25:43.070 --> 25:46.562
Come on, this place is huge.
Noah, take the back porch.

25:46.570 --> 25:48.060
Scream if you see anything.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.809
That won't be hard.

25:49.810 --> 25:52.233
Here, take this.

25:52.250 --> 25:52.875
Okay.

25:52.880 --> 25:55.917
But in observation
of this loaded moment,

25:55.920 --> 25:57.808
I am not in favor
of splitting up,

25:57.820 --> 26:00.482
Nor am I three
days from retiring.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.553
I will not be right back!

26:26.710 --> 26:28.507
(door unlocking)

26:59.350 --> 27:00.772
Oh, no.

27:06.950 --> 27:08.486
Audrey.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.882
(pounding)

27:14.300 --> 27:16.393
Somebody help me!

27:27.910 --> 27:28.706
(gasps)

27:28.710 --> 27:31.577
Oh, my god. Is that
piper's handprint?

27:31.580 --> 27:32.399
I don't know.

27:32.410 --> 27:34.344
Hey! Yo!
(emma and kieran gasp)

27:34.350 --> 27:36.045
Yo! Unnecessary!

27:36.050 --> 27:37.711
Calm down.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.181
(jake exhales)

27:40.550 --> 27:42.984
Jake, what
the hell happened?

27:42.990 --> 27:44.082
I don't know.

27:44.090 --> 27:46.524
Me and brooke got into a thing
in the wine cellar,

27:46.530 --> 27:47.781
And then I went
and took a walk
by the lake

27:47.800 --> 27:50.325
And when I came back,
nobody was here.

27:50.330 --> 27:52.389
I can't find her anywhere.

27:52.400 --> 27:55.494
(distant pounding)
what's that sound?

27:56.140 --> 27:57.493
Brooke: (faintly) let me out!

27:57.510 --> 27:59.705
I think it's
coming from the garage.

28:08.550 --> 28:09.847
Let's check the workshop!

28:09.850 --> 28:11.545
(pounding continues)

28:11.550 --> 28:13.040
Oh, the freezer!

28:13.050 --> 28:14.381
Brooke! Oh, my god!

28:14.390 --> 28:15.812
Brooke! Can
you hear me?

28:15.820 --> 28:16.787
We need to open this now!

28:16.790 --> 28:19.088
Okay. Heads up!
Emma: Brooke!

28:23.700 --> 28:24.724
Hey. Hey!

28:24.730 --> 28:27.198
(jake grunts)
brooke. Brooke, say something.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.861
Oh, my god.
She's so cold.

28:28.870 --> 28:31.259
We have to warm her up.
Jake: Oh, I got it.

28:31.270 --> 28:32.532
Emma: Jake!
(brooke groans)

28:32.540 --> 28:34.565
I'm still breathing,
you creep!

28:34.580 --> 28:36.775
Cpr's always a good idea.

28:36.780 --> 28:37.701
Brooke, what happened?

28:37.710 --> 28:40.201
(breathing heavily)
branson was here.

28:40.210 --> 28:40.972
He just...

28:40.980 --> 28:43.949
He just showed up,
and I came here to hide.

28:43.950 --> 28:45.474
Oh, god, I hate this freezer.

28:45.490 --> 28:47.048
We have to find audrey.

28:47.050 --> 28:48.278
Let's go.

28:48.290 --> 28:49.814
It's okay, emma, go.

28:49.820 --> 28:50.650
It's okay.

28:50.660 --> 28:53.151
Go.
Jake, stay here.

28:54.600 --> 28:55.555
I'm here.

28:55.560 --> 28:59.394
I'll keep you safe.
I'm here.

29:02.900 --> 29:04.458
Audrey!

29:07.480 --> 29:09.163
Oh, man.

29:09.380 --> 29:12.235
Maybe someone just
spilled their wine.

29:12.250 --> 29:15.469
Their thick, viscous red wine.

29:16.520 --> 29:18.249
(breathing heavily)

29:21.920 --> 29:23.512
(gasping)

29:26.160 --> 29:28.321
Noah.
(screaming)

29:34.500 --> 29:35.592
Emma: Noah?

29:35.600 --> 29:36.567
It's okay, I'm fine.

29:36.570 --> 29:39.130
I'm fine, too.
Oh, my god.

29:39.340 --> 29:40.159
What happened?

29:40.170 --> 29:41.535
I almost brained
her is what happened.

29:41.540 --> 29:44.509
The killer was here.
He killed grayson
and then he came after me.

29:44.510 --> 29:45.909
How are you even alive?

29:45.910 --> 29:46.706
I have no idea.

29:46.710 --> 29:49.042
I saw the mask
and then everything
went black.

29:49.050 --> 29:50.711
You and brooke are
luclq to be alive.

29:50.720 --> 29:54.144
Leaving survivors is not
exactly this guy's m.O.

29:54.160 --> 29:57.288
I don't know.
You su_rvived.
TWIce.

29:57.290 --> 29:59.417
Yeah, being a hero.

29:59.430 --> 30:02.752
God, can someone
please call a doctor
so I survive?

30:02.760 --> 30:03.727
Cell phones are still out.

30:03.730 --> 30:05.721
There's a land
line in the kitchen.

30:05.730 --> 30:08.119
A land line?
What is this, 1996?

30:08.140 --> 30:09.027
Okay, you guys keep watch.

30:09.040 --> 30:11.133
I'm gonna go call my mom
and try and get help.

30:11.140 --> 30:12.767
All right, I'm gonna
get a first aid kit.

30:12.770 --> 30:14.704
You know how to
use that, right?

30:14.710 --> 30:15.961
Uh...

30:15.980 --> 30:18.130
Yeah, yeah, totally.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.708
I got it.

30:31.030 --> 30:32.918
(telephone ringing)

30:41.600 --> 30:42.862
Are you calling to gloat?

30:42.870 --> 30:45.691
/(/ller.'
Not at all.
You finally got a win.

30:45.710 --> 30:48.235
Just cut to
the chase, okay?

30:48.240 --> 30:49.832
This is the big
finale, right?

30:49.840 --> 30:51.569
So, here I am.
Come and get me.

30:51.580 --> 30:55.300
Small catch, emma.
Its not just you that I want.

30:55.320 --> 30:56.105
What?
Yes.

30:56.120 --> 31:00.545
I told you it
started with daisy,
but it ends with you!

31:00.550 --> 31:02.689
Can ’t ha ve one
without the other.

31:02.690 --> 31:04.419
Oh, my god.

31:04.860 --> 31:05.554
Where is she?

31:05.560 --> 31:08.757
You ’re a smart girl, emma.
Figure it out.

31:12.630 --> 31:16.122
Where it ended
for brandon james.

31:16.340 --> 31:17.193
The dock at wren lake.

31:17.200 --> 31:20.931
Just you, emma,
or others wﬂl o’ie/

31:39.690 --> 31:42.056
(panting) mom! Mom!

31:42.500 --> 31:43.558
(muffled screaming)

31:43.560 --> 31:44.595
Oh, my god!
Are you okay?

31:44.600 --> 31:47.125
(grunts) you
shouldn't have come!
Are you okay?

31:47.130 --> 31:48.688
No, I shouldn't
have left you.

31:48.700 --> 31:50.463
I am so sorry.

31:51.810 --> 31:54.563
Emma, he's here.

31:56.640 --> 31:58.301
No,donT!

32:01.880 --> 32:03.541
(breathing heavily)

32:04.490 --> 32:05.718
I'm here.

32:05.720 --> 32:07.745
Just like you wanted.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.580
No more games.

32:10.490 --> 32:12.310
No more masks.

32:25.010 --> 32:27.808
Hey, sis. Surprise.

32:27.810 --> 32:29.562
Piper?

32:31.150 --> 32:36.008
I seriously wish
that you could see
your face right now.

32:36.450 --> 32:38.816
Hashtag, mind blown.

32:39.350 --> 32:42.114
No, you can't be.

32:42.490 --> 32:43.957
I can.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.587
(scoffs)

32:46.060 --> 32:50.156
So when we were
bonding about your
dad being murdered,

32:50.160 --> 32:53.368
You were talking
about brandon james.

32:53.370 --> 32:54.029
Yes.

32:54.030 --> 32:57.067
And you were so easily
convinced that it had
to be his son

32:57.070 --> 33:01.029
That was swinging the knife,
but it's 2015, emma.

33:01.040 --> 33:01.836
Sexist much?

33:01.840 --> 33:04.934
You pretended to help me.
You pretended to be my friend.

33:04.950 --> 33:09.341
And it stings
when someone
breaks your trust.

33:09.350 --> 33:10.442
Right, mom?

33:10.450 --> 33:13.681
My dad trusted you
and look how
that turned out.

33:13.690 --> 33:18.582
Dad got shot, I got tossed,
and emma got the perfect life.

33:18.590 --> 33:23.129
Piper, I swear to you,
I never meant for
brandon to get hurt.

33:23.130 --> 33:24.051
I was trying
to protect him.

33:24.060 --> 33:26.665
You were trying to
protect yourself!

33:26.670 --> 33:33.064
For 20 years, you have
let everyone think that
my dad was the monster,

33:33.270 --> 33:35.636
But you were the monster.

33:35.640 --> 33:36.334
You're right.

33:36.340 --> 33:39.309
But they were
my mistakes,
not emma's.

33:39.880 --> 33:42.940
If you wanna hurt
someone, hurt me!

33:42.950 --> 33:43.712
I plan on it.

33:43.720 --> 33:47.542
But I have kind of
put a lot of thought
and time into this,

33:47.550 --> 33:49.586
So I'd like to savor
the moment a little bit

33:49.590 --> 33:51.558
Before I slice
you open, okay?

33:51.560 --> 33:55.052
I get it. I get it!
You hate us!

33:55.260 --> 33:56.557
But why did you
kill my friends?

33:56.560 --> 33:58.528
They had nothing
to do with this!

33:58.530 --> 34:01.328
To watch you
suffer, emma.
(chuckles)

34:01.340 --> 34:03.934
Although they
did help a lot.

34:03.940 --> 34:08.058
After all, what did
your bffs do?

34:08.080 --> 34:12.335
They filmed
your first time.

34:12.350 --> 34:16.810
I mean, the day that
your video accidentally
went viral

34:16.820 --> 34:20.449
And I was right there
to see it happen?

34:20.450 --> 34:22.441
(inhales) priceless.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.257
They're gonna figure
out who did this.

34:24.260 --> 34:28.685
No, they won't.
Because the bad guy did it.

34:28.700 --> 34:33.364
And I have him back there,
tied up in my trunk.

34:33.370 --> 34:34.564
You framed branson.

34:34.570 --> 34:37.095
Do you know
one benefit of
stripping off masks

34:37.100 --> 34:41.434
Is sometimes you find
the perfect fall guy.

34:41.440 --> 34:43.635
Do you wanna know
how his story ends?

34:43.640 --> 34:47.474
Branson slits emma's
throat in front of mom

34:47.480 --> 34:50.074
Before spilling mom's guts.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.211
But not before emma
gets a good stabbing

34:52.220 --> 34:55.712
With the knife
that she has hidden
behind her back.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.455
Yeah. Fingerprints, sis.

34:58.460 --> 34:59.711
Rookie move.

34:59.730 --> 35:02.381
So then I'm gonna stumble
out of the bloodbath

35:02.400 --> 35:05.255
And I'm gonna broadcast
to the world

35:05.270 --> 35:08.398
That the lakewood
slasher is dead.

35:08.400 --> 35:10.595
You're right.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.632
She will be!

35:13.070 --> 35:13.934
(screaming) no!

35:13.940 --> 35:16.363
(groans) you're
so predictable!

35:16.380 --> 35:21.647
So now, mommy dearest,
you're gonna get
to watch her die.

35:21.650 --> 35:23.914
But I want you
to know, sis,

35:23.920 --> 35:29.711
That when it's her turn,
I'm gonna let her
bleed out alone,

35:29.720 --> 35:31.085
The way that she left me.

35:31.090 --> 35:33.251
No!
(grunts)

35:33.830 --> 35:34.979
(crying) no!

35:35.000 --> 35:36.854
You broke my heart, mom.

35:36.860 --> 35:37.622
Please stop.

35:37.630 --> 35:40.121
You always hurt
the ones you love.

35:40.130 --> 35:41.392
(mag ' U“ S
gie
gr t )

35:41.400 --> 35:43.698
(maggie grunting)

35:43.700 --> 35:45.861
(gasping)

35:46.870 --> 35:48.633
You psychotic bitch!

35:50.680 --> 35:52.432
(both yelling)

35:52.850 --> 35:54.704
(both grunting)

35:56.950 --> 35:58.713
No, please.

35:58.720 --> 36:01.382
(maggie groaning)
(heavy breathing)

36:02.020 --> 36:08.482
So, I have one
more surprise for you
before I open you up.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.526
And you'll never
see it coming...

36:11.530 --> 36:13.669
(gunshot)
(gasps)

36:15.500 --> 36:17.138
Audrey.

36:20.370 --> 36:22.235
Oh, my god, audrey.

36:22.240 --> 36:23.468
Oh, my god. Thank you.

36:23.480 --> 36:24.936
Bitch talks too much.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.338
Mom!

36:26.580 --> 36:27.569
Emma...

36:27.580 --> 36:29.468
Mom, are you okay?

36:35.820 --> 36:37.754
(panﬁng)

36:39.290 --> 36:41.019
Nice shot.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.256
They always come back.

36:49.270 --> 36:51.135
Emma: (crying) mom.

36:51.140 --> 36:52.493
Mom.

36:53.770 --> 36:55.169
Mom.

36:59.080 --> 37:00.877
Mom.
(maggie grunts)

37:12.330 --> 37:14.082
(birds chirping)

37:33.650 --> 37:35.140
Emma: Mom.

37:36.380 --> 37:38.871
(weakly) I'm so sorry.

37:40.190 --> 37:41.589
(sighs) we made it.

37:41.590 --> 37:43.148
We did.

37:43.160 --> 37:44.559
It's over.

37:44.560 --> 37:45.913
I love you.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.522
I love you, too.

37:48.330 --> 37:50.298
See you there.

37:52.530 --> 37:55.169
They found branson in
the back of piper's trunk.

37:55.170 --> 37:56.467
(brooke sighs)

37:56.470 --> 37:57.539
He's gonna be fine.

37:57.540 --> 37:59.496
I'm just glad
he's okay.

37:59.510 --> 38:01.808
Do you want me to
go check on him?

38:01.810 --> 38:03.232
No.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.208
I'm good here with you.

38:12.120 --> 38:15.089
Told you that gun
might come in handy.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.052
I'm so sorry.

38:17.060 --> 38:21.224
About doubting you,
about your dad...

38:21.230 --> 38:23.755
Everything.
I know.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.695
Is there any way that
we can get past this?

38:27.500 --> 38:29.092
I think so.

38:30.770 --> 38:32.533
I'm gonna ride
with my mom.

38:32.540 --> 38:35.031
Okay. I'll meet you there.

38:39.350 --> 38:41.602
You got your classic
showdown at the lake,

38:41.620 --> 38:43.474
Tying together
the past and present.

38:43.480 --> 38:46.142
And survivor girl
in the back of an ambulance,

38:46.150 --> 38:47.845
Just like somebody predicted.

38:47.850 --> 38:48.612
Exactly!

38:48.620 --> 38:50.656
Except today,
we're all sitting

38:50.660 --> 38:52.719
In the back of
the ambulance together.

38:52.730 --> 38:53.754
Well, not literally,

38:53.760 --> 38:57.059
'cause then we wouldn't
all fit, but you know
what I mean.

38:57.060 --> 38:57.549
I do.

38:57.560 --> 39:00.358
I'm just glad I saw
em run into the woods.

39:00.370 --> 39:01.120
I almost lost her.

39:01.130 --> 39:04.896
You were a genuine
crime-fighting hero
tonight, bi-curious.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.161
Right back at you, virgin.

39:06.170 --> 39:07.728
(chuckles)

39:08.410 --> 39:09.001
Audrey: Mmm.

39:09.010 --> 39:10.807
Are you okay?
Not really.

39:10.810 --> 39:13.870
Yeah, we gotta get
you to the hospital.

Noah: (from computer speakers)
hey, guys,
this is noah foster,

39:24.620 --> 39:28.750
Local student and
survivor of the
lakewood slasher murders,

39:28.760 --> 39:33.561
Guest podcasting
the final chapter
of
autopsy of a crime

39:33.570 --> 39:34.366
For your former host

39:34.370 --> 39:36.463
The .no w-deceased
cnm/na/ masterm/nd

39:36.470 --> 39:38.961
Behind the k/l/ings,
piper shaw.

39:38.970 --> 39:41.700
So having made it
to the end of our .
very own slasher mo we,

39:41.710 --> 39:45.237
I think we ’re
all just processing
what we ’ve lost

39:45.250 --> 39:46.137
And how to move on.

39:46.150 --> 39:49.369
Staring death in the face has
a way of making you want

39:49.380 --> 39:51.712
To be a little more forgiv/ng.

39:51.990 --> 39:52.513
Hey.

39:52.520 --> 39:55.239
Maybe we 7/ find
that the loss of
someone we loved

39:55.260 --> 39:58.889
May lead to the promise
of someone new.

40:03.730 --> 40:07.120
Maybe we 7/ see
this as a second chance
to do things oiﬂ‘erent/y

40:07.130 --> 40:10.463
And make a change
for the good.

40:13.870 --> 40:18.534
Or to wipe the slate clean
and re-in vent ourselves
as someone new.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.905
At the end of the day,
we ’re all just
grateful that its over

40:20.910 --> 40:22.707
And that the lakewood
slasher is dead

40:22.720 --> 40:26.019
But there is st/l/ one thing
I can ’t figure out.

40:26.020 --> 40:28.409
P/per shaw confessed
to her cr/mes

40:29.460 --> 40:33.180
But she didn ’t explain
who attacked her
and wﬂl be/mont

40:33.190 --> 40:35.454
In that abandoned bu/lding.

40:35.460 --> 40:36.791
I mean, sure, she could ’ve
banged herself

40:36.800 --> 40:41.294
0n the head and
made up the story,
but wﬂl conﬁrmed it later.

40:44.100 --> 40:47.365
Much as I love
a good hol/ywood ending,
I can ’t help but wonder,

40:47.370 --> 40:50.203
Who was wearing
the mask that night?

40:53.910 --> 40:56.447
Am I just ove/thinking it?

40:58.690 --> 41:00.988
Or is there more to come?
