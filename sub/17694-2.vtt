WEBVTT

00:03.437 --> 00:05.004
(sighs)

00:05.006 --> 00:06.638
I love springtime,

00:06.640 --> 00:08.841
when the bulky sweatshirts
come off,

00:08.843 --> 00:11.877
and you can see which guys
were in the gym all winter.

00:11.879 --> 00:14.346
What's that, snot?
Why am I so distracted today?

00:16.150 --> 00:18.884
'Cause I'm craving something,
something I've never had.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.686
Potato boobs!

00:20.688 --> 00:22.021
(chomping)

00:22.023 --> 00:24.523
you can have
the starchy simulacra.

00:24.525 --> 00:28.260
I need to -- nay, I<i> will</i> touch
the real thing.

00:31.899 --> 00:35.868
Exactly! What kind of guys
get boob at this school?

00:35.870 --> 00:38.037
I could be
Tanya Johnson's baby.

00:38.039 --> 00:41.707
(speaks inaudibly)

00:41.709 --> 00:44.676
but he's doing that. Or...

00:44.678 --> 00:46.512
¶¶

00:46.514 --> 00:48.313
<i>Hello.</i>

00:48.315 --> 00:50.749
Varsity athletes
touch boob!

00:50.751 --> 00:52.818
'Cause they got
those cool letter jackets!

00:52.820 --> 00:55.954
(scoffs) And how are you gonna
become a varsity athlete?

00:59.760 --> 01:01.827
Hardly anyone's going out
for water polo.

01:01.829 --> 01:04.263
I-it's like they're
giving letter jackets away!

01:04.265 --> 01:06.598
Or you could buy
a foreign knockoff jacket

01:06.600 --> 01:08.167
and say you transferred in.

01:08.169 --> 01:12.037
I really think people
don't remember us.

01:12.039 --> 01:14.573
¶¶

01:14.575 --> 01:17.242
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

01:17.244 --> 01:20.946
¶ I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day ¶

01:20.948 --> 01:24.083
¶ The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

01:24.085 --> 01:28.587
¶ And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race ¶

01:30.391 --> 01:33.425
¶ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

01:33.427 --> 01:36.028
¶ Good -- ¶
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

01:36.030 --> 01:37.329
Aah!

01:38.532 --> 01:42.000
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

01:44.572 --> 01:47.573
(indistinct conversations)

01:47.575 --> 01:50.042
Man, these C.I.A. auctions
are amazing.

01:50.044 --> 01:51.977
There's so much cool stuff.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.712
Hey, can we get
a Farsi translator?

01:53.714 --> 01:55.147
Please, please, please?

01:55.149 --> 01:56.949
Will you feed her
and take her for walks?

01:56.951 --> 01:58.217
No.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.618
And sold!

01:59.620 --> 02:01.453
This working hellfire missile

02:01.455 --> 02:04.890
goes to the man stroking a cat
menacingly in the front row.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.391
(chuckles)
Oh, it's not for me.

02:06.393 --> 02:08.727
It's for downtown Pittsburgh.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.662
(cat purrs)

02:10.664 --> 02:13.999
Our next item is
a 26-foot sailboat

02:14.001 --> 02:17.169
seized off the coast
of<i> Colombia.</i>

02:17.171 --> 02:18.637
Wow.
Wow.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.906
I've always wanted to be
a boat guy.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.075
I know, right?
Hanging out on the deck,

02:23.077 --> 02:25.244
washing down fries
from the marina café

02:25.246 --> 02:26.845
with some cheap canned beer,

02:26.847 --> 02:29.414
making constant small repairs,

02:29.416 --> 02:32.017
getting sunburned and
complaining the whole time...

02:32.019 --> 02:33.652
Sounds like heaven.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.455
Why don't we start the bidding
at $5,000?

02:36.457 --> 02:38.624
Right here!
I see $5,000. Do I have --

02:38.626 --> 02:40.025
$10,000!
$20,000!

02:40.027 --> 02:41.460
$50,000!

02:41.462 --> 02:43.028
What the hell is going on?!

02:43.030 --> 02:45.330
'Scusies?
Has the Colombian boat

02:45.332 --> 02:47.032
been searched for cocaine?

02:47.034 --> 02:49.601
Uh, yes. There is no cocaine
on the boat.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.370
-Take backs.
-Me, too.
I'm out.

02:51.372 --> 02:54.339
Sold to the transvestite
in the red dress.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.341
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:56.343 --> 02:58.043
He is good.

02:58.045 --> 03:00.746
He's got a better eye
than Garry Marshall.

03:04.018 --> 03:05.284
¶¶

03:05.286 --> 03:06.985
Good afternoon, men,

03:06.987 --> 03:09.688
and welcome to
water polo tryouts.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.557
I'm the new coach,
James Hetfield.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.125
I know what you're thinking.

03:13.127 --> 03:16.195
"Whoa, the James Hetfield
from Metallica?"

03:16.197 --> 03:17.729
The answer is no way...

03:17.731 --> 03:19.898
Even though
I look and sound like him

03:19.900 --> 03:21.633
and have all his guitars.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.202
The point is, if I had to deal

03:23.204 --> 03:25.070
with the kind of pressure
that guy's under,

03:25.072 --> 03:28.473
I'd probably crack and end up as
a high school water polo coach.

03:28.475 --> 03:30.175
So, it's a good thing
that I'm just

03:30.177 --> 03:32.444
this very different
James Hetfield.

03:34.748 --> 03:37.516
Okay, I appreciate
everyone's interest in the team,

03:37.518 --> 03:40.385
but I can only keep 13 boys.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.821
And...there are 13 of you
trying out.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.056
Okay, we're good.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.857
Sweet!
(door bangs open)

03:45.859 --> 03:48.193
Not so...

03:48.195 --> 03:50.529
Uhh! (groans) Not...

03:50.531 --> 03:52.497
Not so fast!

03:52.499 --> 03:55.434
I'll take<i> my</i> jacket
in a women's medium.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.202
(water splashing)

03:57.204 --> 03:59.771
I got cut
from water polo tryouts!

03:59.773 --> 04:01.240
So you're not on a team,

04:01.242 --> 04:03.275
and I don't get to hang
with the cool parents

04:03.277 --> 04:05.244
for yet another year.
Gotcha.

04:05.246 --> 04:08.080
(spoon clatters)

04:08.082 --> 04:10.282
Great. No one cares.
I care.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.351
Klaus? Wh-where are you?

04:12.353 --> 04:16.021
On the table, under a pair
of Stan's workout shorts.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.357
He missed
the dirty clothes hamper...

04:18.359 --> 04:20.359
by, like, 80 feet.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.394
So tell me about
this water polo tryout.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.929
How was your eggbeater?

04:23.931 --> 04:26.131
Were your dry passes not to
the strong side hand?

04:26.133 --> 04:27.966
Uh...I don't know.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.968
Wha-- how do<i> you</i> know so much
about water polo?

04:29.970 --> 04:31.770
Eh, growing up,
it was a terrific way

04:31.772 --> 04:33.138
to avoid Turkish people.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.973
Now I can give you
some pointers,

04:34.975 --> 04:37.442
and we will force the coach
to reconsider you.

04:37.444 --> 04:38.710
Awesome!

04:38.712 --> 04:40.312
I am going to make you

04:40.314 --> 04:44.049
the greatest water polo player
in the world!

04:44.051 --> 04:47.419
Yeah!
Step aside, Peter Nordquis!

04:47.421 --> 04:50.322
Wow. You really know
your water polo.

04:50.324 --> 04:54.259
I was just making a name up.
Welp, you got it right.

04:54.261 --> 04:55.861
Ready?
Ready!

04:59.400 --> 05:01.266
There seems to have been
a misunderstanding

05:01.268 --> 05:03.769
about what kind of boat guys
we're gonna be.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.805
Whoa! Is it true you guys
bought a sailboat?!
What do you care?

05:06.807 --> 05:09.675
I love sailing. I practically
grew up on boats.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.243
I taught at sailing camp.

05:11.245 --> 05:12.911
It's the one thing
I'm really good at.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.980
I guess, statistically,
there had to be one.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.648
If you ever need any help
with the boat --

05:16.650 --> 05:17.983
No.
I'd be happy to --

05:17.985 --> 05:19.384
(cocks gun)

05:20.688 --> 05:22.254
Guns are a great tool

05:22.256 --> 05:24.856
for keeping things from
escalating out of control.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.625
Now then, about this outfit
disagreement...

05:26.627 --> 05:29.261
(cocks gun)
You're gonna dress my way.

05:29.263 --> 05:31.530
<i> Nice</i> and easy.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.665
See? This works!
No talking!

05:33.667 --> 05:35.967
Let's hit the marina.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.469
(panting)
I just got mugged!

05:37.471 --> 05:40.505
(both whistling)

05:45.679 --> 05:48.613
Ugh. Look at your upper body
bobbing and swaying.

05:48.615 --> 05:50.649
You look like
a broken Barbie doll

05:50.651 --> 05:52.551
surfacing
after a ferry sinking.

05:52.553 --> 05:55.187
Well, how do I stay still?

05:55.189 --> 05:57.656
Tuck your hips in.
(grunts) Like this?

05:57.658 --> 05:59.424
Ugh. Here, watch me.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.261
Like this.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.231
Dude, what is wrong
with you?

06:06.233 --> 06:07.866
I don't understand
what I'm supposed to do!

06:07.868 --> 06:10.302
You're supposed to do this.

06:11.505 --> 06:14.673
Aah!
Tuck..your...hips!

06:14.675 --> 06:16.641
Ooh!

06:16.643 --> 06:20.545
Then you pick up a ball,
eggbeater for elevation,

06:20.547 --> 06:22.447
and fire it into
the back of the net.
(grunts)

06:24.084 --> 06:25.717
Whoa.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.052
Holy crap.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.754
You "ratatouille"'d me!

06:28.756 --> 06:30.555
But it's not like
I can go to tryouts with a --

06:30.557 --> 06:32.691
with a -- with a fish
hanging on my shorts.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.593
I'm just gonna
have to keep practicing

06:34.595 --> 06:35.894
till I can do it myself.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.330
(scoffs)
A fish hanging on my shorts.

06:38.332 --> 06:40.599
You know, in Japan,
a fish on your shorts

06:40.601 --> 06:43.568
is eight years of
neither good nor bad luck.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.571
The Japanese
are<i> very</i> superstitious.

06:46.573 --> 06:50.409
(Metallica's
"Master of Puppets" playing)

06:50.411 --> 06:53.612
(grunting)

06:53.614 --> 06:57.449
(chuckles) Wow.
Smith, you just made the team.

06:57.451 --> 06:58.784
¶ Master! ¶

06:58.786 --> 07:00.185
¶ Master! ¶
(crank clicking)

07:00.187 --> 07:03.021
¶ Master! ¶

07:03.023 --> 07:06.191
I don't know what got into you,
but I love it.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.193
You're stronger,
more confident.

07:08.195 --> 07:11.129
Even your package looks bigger.
Well done.

07:15.969 --> 07:19.704
Nothing wrong with
a fish hanging<i> in</i> your shorts.

07:19.706 --> 07:24.142
(both laughing maniacally)

07:24.144 --> 07:26.978
There's probably a few things
wrong with it.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.483
¶¶

07:31.485 --> 07:34.719
(spectators murmuring)

07:36.757 --> 07:39.224
Look at those guys
with their tit-eating grins.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.992
Time to join 'em.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.228
All right, Klaus.
Take the curly reins.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.432
(high-pitched voice) Aah!
Let's go, Scottie!

07:47.434 --> 07:50.001
Focus, Matt!
Please note that I'm here, Nick!

07:50.003 --> 07:51.803
I have to go back
to work soon!

07:55.576 --> 07:57.008
(whistle blows)

07:57.010 --> 07:58.643
("Master of Puppets" playing)

07:58.645 --> 08:00.312
(spectators cheer)

08:00.314 --> 08:02.781
¶¶

08:02.783 --> 08:04.249
(spectators cheer)

08:07.654 --> 08:09.521
(grunts)
(spectators cheer)

08:10.691 --> 08:15.327
¶ Obey your master ¶

08:15.329 --> 08:17.863
Yah!
(spectators cheer)

08:17.865 --> 08:20.298
¶¶

08:20.300 --> 08:22.334
Wow! Uh...go, Steve!

08:22.336 --> 08:24.302
WOMAN: You're Steve's mom?

08:24.304 --> 08:26.605
(hesitantly) Yes?
Your son's a superstar!

08:26.607 --> 08:28.173
What are you doing
way over there?

08:28.175 --> 08:29.674
You<i> have</i> to sit with us!

08:29.676 --> 08:32.210
Really?
With the cool parents?

08:32.212 --> 08:35.647
Let me just check for something
in my purse.

08:35.649 --> 08:38.149
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

08:38.151 --> 08:39.451
(bleep) Yes!

08:39.453 --> 08:42.687
¶ Master! Master! ¶
(cheering)

08:44.124 --> 08:46.658
Great first game, men.
That was as exciting

08:46.660 --> 08:49.127
as singing in front
of 70,000 people

08:49.129 --> 08:51.663
at Giants Stadium...
I would imagine.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.498
Tell you what.
You keep the wins going,

08:53.500 --> 08:55.834
I'm taking you all
to Raging Waters,

08:55.836 --> 08:57.536
and everyone can
bring a friend.

08:57.538 --> 09:01.239
(cheering)
I'm bringing David!

09:05.712 --> 09:08.179
You hear that, buddy?
Raging Waters.

09:08.181 --> 09:13.018
So much water, so much rage.
It sounds lovely.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.020
Well, you're gonna be
my plus-one.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.923
Really?
Of course. You're my partner.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.892
Hell, right now you're my
best friend in the whole world.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.362
(breathing unevenly)

09:24.364 --> 09:26.898
(sobbing quietly)

09:26.900 --> 09:28.867
(fizzles)

09:28.869 --> 09:30.869
(water lapping,
seabird calling)

09:30.871 --> 09:33.338
(boat approaching)

09:35.242 --> 09:37.075
Slow down!
No wake!

09:38.378 --> 09:40.345
Assholes.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.147
(can crunches, water splashes)

09:43.917 --> 09:46.084
Thanks, buddy. (slurps)

09:46.086 --> 09:48.753
Hey, you think we should, uh,
sand something?

09:48.755 --> 09:50.789
Something always needs
sanding.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.291
(scratching)

09:53.293 --> 09:55.226
(can crunches)
Whew! Hot work.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.962
I could use
another cold one, Stan.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.797
Oh, I think we're out.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.232
Who the...what the...

10:01.234 --> 10:03.802
(angelic music plays)
You boys looked dry.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.072
(fizzes)
Welcome to the marina.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.374
Or as they say in Spanish,

10:09.376 --> 10:11.876
<i>bienvenidos</i> to the marina.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.378
I'm Van Dusen.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.980
I'm Roger,
and this is Stan.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.715
We're just up
from the B.V.I.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.383
(gulps) Ahh. Good sail.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.218
(gulps) Good sail.
(gulps) Good sail. Good sail.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.054
You, uh...painting
after you sand?

10:23.056 --> 10:24.923
You know it.
Ain't that just how it goes?

10:24.925 --> 10:26.291
It surely is.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.826
You know what
I tell my friends

10:27.828 --> 10:30.095
when they ask what it's like
to own a boat?

10:30.097 --> 10:33.798
I say,
"stand under a cold shower

10:33.800 --> 10:36.334
and tear up $100 bills."

10:36.336 --> 10:38.670
(laughing) Oh, my God,
you're perfect!

10:38.672 --> 10:40.772
That's such a perfect thing
to say!

10:40.774 --> 10:43.241
(chuckles) It surely is.

10:43.243 --> 10:47.045
Well, I'll see ya, boys.
I got a fuel line to patch.

10:48.448 --> 10:51.249
Did you see all the melanomas
on his arms?

10:51.251 --> 10:52.651
<i>That's</i> a boat guy.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.619
And now we are, too.
(clink)

10:54.621 --> 10:56.955
How's the sanding going?
I think I've been sanding
a window.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.289
Cool.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.792
¶¶

11:00.794 --> 11:02.160
Morning, mom.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.195
Sit, Steve.
I made you breakfast.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.164
I-I'm kind of running late
for school, and --

11:06.166 --> 11:08.033
This is just
a little thank-you

11:08.035 --> 11:11.269
for turning me into
one of the cool jock parents.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.604
Well, I'm glad to help.

11:12.606 --> 11:15.040
I never thought I'd be
part of their world

11:15.042 --> 11:18.977
because you and Hayley have
always sucked at everything.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.446
Hey. What's for breakfast?
Nothin'. Beat it.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.549
(Metallica's
"All Nightmare Long" plays)

11:24.551 --> 11:27.519
¶ 'Cause we hunt you down
without mercy ¶

11:27.521 --> 11:30.855
¶ Hunt you down
all nightmare long ¶

11:30.857 --> 11:33.491
¶ Feel us breathe
upon your face ¶

11:33.493 --> 11:36.194
¶ Feel us shift,
every move we trace ¶

11:36.196 --> 11:38.963
¶ Hunt you down without mercy ¶

11:38.965 --> 11:40.799
¶ Hunt you down all night -- ¶

11:40.801 --> 11:42.500
(camera shutter clicks)

11:42.502 --> 11:44.035
Hey! No cameras!

11:44.037 --> 11:45.837
Are you reaching
for something?

11:45.839 --> 11:47.338
Only greatness.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.807
I'm Amy Reed, sports editor

11:48.809 --> 11:50.308
of the<i> Pearl Bailey Gazette.</i>

11:50.310 --> 11:52.377
A girl trying to make it
in a boys' world.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.045
I respect the hell
out of that.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.847
You're taking the school
by storm,

11:55.849 --> 11:58.049
and I want to know
what makes you so good.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.151
My laser-like focus.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.420
(breathily) Oh, my.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.922
To be continued.

12:05.092 --> 12:09.094
Okay, the new name for
your shorts is "The Bone Yard,"

12:09.096 --> 12:11.563
'cause there were
<i> so</i> many bones in there.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.031
Wait, did -- did you also
have a --

12:13.033 --> 12:14.933
Oh, don't tell me you didn't
feel mine, bro.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.168
That's bullshit, man.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.070
(seabirds calling)

12:21.842 --> 12:24.342
Ugh. Soggy.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.010
I can't get a single fry
in my mouth!

12:26.012 --> 12:28.413
(thud)
Aah! I didn't ask for a beer!

12:28.415 --> 12:31.449
Throwing beers is the only thing
that breaks up the monotony.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.685
Owning a boat sucks.
It does.

12:33.687 --> 12:35.787
It's just
constant maintenance.

12:35.789 --> 12:39.023
Should we...I don't know,
try sailing it?

12:39.025 --> 12:41.926
Where? Where in the ocean
do you need to go?

12:41.928 --> 12:45.597
Uh, here's the bill
for this month's slip fee.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.467
Are you kidding me?
Oh, my God!

12:49.469 --> 12:52.637
$14?! That's an hour
of kiln time!

12:52.639 --> 12:54.272
That's it.
We're sellin' the boat.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.607
Heh, good luck.

12:55.609 --> 12:58.977
I've been trying to sell mine
for 15 years.

12:58.979 --> 13:03.248
Trouble is, most people know
how stupid it is to own a boat.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.583
Sometimes I just wish
this thing would sink

13:05.585 --> 13:07.652
so I could get
the insurance money.

13:07.654 --> 13:10.321
That gives me an idea.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.890
Me, too.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.058
Oh, I love it when we have
ideas at the same time!

13:14.060 --> 13:16.661
So do I! Bring it in.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.263
(lowered voice) I think
we should get Pinkberry.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.298
(lowered voice) Oh, yum, yum,
yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.301
And after that, let's commit...
(whispers) insurance fraud.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.304
(whispers) It's so easy
to make plans with you.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.807
¶¶

13:28.809 --> 13:30.441
Hey, Klaus.

13:30.443 --> 13:33.344
I see Amy's water polo story
came out in the school paper.

13:33.346 --> 13:36.147
Yeah, pretty cool.
She calls me the "pool shark."

13:36.149 --> 13:39.951
"When asked how he got so good
at water polo, Smith replied,

13:39.953 --> 13:43.188
"'by being totally awesome
all by myself with no help.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.589
#Blessed'"

13:44.591 --> 13:46.324
What is this crap?!

13:46.326 --> 13:48.960
Come on! I couldn't say
I had a fish in my shorts.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.662
I-I'd get kicked off
the team!

13:50.664 --> 13:52.297
You wouldn't even
<i> be</i> on the team

13:52.299 --> 13:54.599
if<i> I</i> wasn't steering you
by the pubes.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.801
Ugh, Klaus, stop being
such a baby.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.269
It's one stupid article.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.271
Yeah, but --
But nothing!

14:00.273 --> 14:02.473
I'm not forgetting about you,
I swear to God!

14:02.475 --> 14:04.943
(horn honks)
Oh, that's the bus
to Raging Waters.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.178
Great, I'll get my stuff.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.446
I'm ready.

14:08.448 --> 14:09.781
<i> Oh.</i> Yeah...

14:09.783 --> 14:11.382
Ugh.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.184
Um, about that...

14:13.186 --> 14:16.955
Come on, Steve!
Thanks for inviting me!

14:16.957 --> 14:18.690
Dude.

14:18.692 --> 14:22.393
I know I invited you first,
but you can't compete with that.

14:24.497 --> 14:29.033
If it's competition you want,
then prepare to lose.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.301
Uh, but not right now,
of course,

14:30.303 --> 14:31.736
because you're killing it.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.638
You're taking a hot girl
to a water park,

14:33.640 --> 14:37.876
and I'm stuck home in a bowl.
<i> But</i> things can change.

14:37.878 --> 14:42.747
Oh, yes, change is in the air.

14:42.749 --> 14:46.951
Change is a-comin'.
Chan--

14:49.656 --> 14:51.489
¶¶

14:51.491 --> 14:53.758
It's been a hell of a season,
men.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.060
You've played for me,
for each other,

14:56.062 --> 14:57.996
and for this letter jacket.

14:57.998 --> 15:01.032
Now let's go send
Fairfax Country Day School...

15:01.034 --> 15:04.402
¶ Off to never-never land, ah ¶

15:11.912 --> 15:14.012
'Sup?
Ready to do this?

15:14.014 --> 15:15.847
I'm thinking today

15:15.849 --> 15:18.549
the pool shark will be
doing it by himself.

15:18.551 --> 15:21.052
I'm too engrossed
in this week's cafeteria menu.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.054
(sighs) Is this about
Raging Waters?

15:23.056 --> 15:25.056
Sloppy Joe Friday.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.058
Start your weekend
on the toilet.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.961
Fine. I don't need you.
Yeah, yeah.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.596
This is gonna be like
the part of "Ratatouille"

15:31.598 --> 15:33.031
when the human realizes

15:33.033 --> 15:34.532
he doesn't need the rat
anymore,

15:34.534 --> 15:36.734
and then he's really successful
on his own,

15:36.736 --> 15:39.103
and then the movie ends.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.905
The movie doesn't end

15:40.907 --> 15:44.075
when you fall asleep
with your blankie, Steve.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.410
(whistle blows,
players shouting)

15:45.412 --> 15:50.448
(grunting)

15:50.450 --> 15:52.617
Ohh! Aah!

15:52.619 --> 15:54.886
The hell's wrong with you,
Smith?!

15:54.888 --> 15:56.454
Is Steve all right?

15:56.456 --> 15:59.891
I don't think so.
He's losing his mother's love.

15:59.893 --> 16:02.560
(grunting)

16:02.562 --> 16:05.596
Look at you, quivering like
the Italian Army.

16:05.598 --> 16:08.333
That's because your legs are as
weak as the Italian Air Force,

16:08.335 --> 16:11.235
which is why you've taken fewer
shots than the Italian Navy.

16:11.237 --> 16:12.837
I'm not just gonna float here

16:12.839 --> 16:15.440
and let you compare me to
the entire Italian armed forces.

16:15.442 --> 16:19.143
Well, what are you gonna
do about it, paisan?

16:19.145 --> 16:20.611
I'm gonna use
all my strength

16:20.613 --> 16:22.847
to be the pool shark
I know I can be!

16:22.849 --> 16:26.384
(triumphant music playing)

16:32.926 --> 16:34.759
(ball bouncing)

16:34.761 --> 16:36.794
(spectators groaning)
Oh! Just missed.

16:36.796 --> 16:41.165
(weakly) And I used...
all my strength.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.500
¶¶

16:42.502 --> 16:44.335
(thinking)<i> Oh, God.</i>

16:44.337 --> 16:47.138
<i> Am I drowning?</i>

16:47.140 --> 16:49.307
<i> I</i> am<i> drowning.</i>

16:49.309 --> 16:52.610
<i> My life is flashing</i>
<i> before my eyes.</i>

16:52.612 --> 16:54.112
(singsongy) Come to Mama!

16:56.216 --> 16:57.548
(thud)

17:00.220 --> 17:02.020
What?! No!

17:02.022 --> 17:04.355
Have fun tonight, honey.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.392
Give him<i> everything</i> he wants.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.460
You bet.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.464
(both moaning)

17:13.466 --> 17:15.967
No! Those are<i> my</i> boobs!

17:15.969 --> 17:18.636
Stop...ignoring me.

17:24.077 --> 17:27.779
(grunts) Hmm.

17:38.058 --> 17:40.725
(bubbling)

17:40.727 --> 17:42.760
Whoa.

17:42.762 --> 17:46.030
(coughing, sputtering)

17:46.032 --> 17:48.332
You okay?
(coughs)

17:48.334 --> 17:52.503
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm better than okay.

17:52.505 --> 17:56.707
It took me being underwater
to finally see things clearly.

17:56.709 --> 17:59.243
That's a great lyric.

17:59.245 --> 18:02.246
I got my confidence back.
I quit.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.051
I have a confession to make.

18:07.053 --> 18:09.520
I didn't become
a great water polo player

18:09.522 --> 18:11.122
all by myself.

18:11.124 --> 18:14.225
In fact, the guy that
made me great is here today.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.960
(lowered voice)
Dude, what are you doing?

18:15.962 --> 18:19.797
You see, sometimes one member of
the team gets the spotlight,

18:19.799 --> 18:21.265
even though
he couldn't have done it

18:21.267 --> 18:24.469
without another member --
an important member.

18:24.471 --> 18:27.205
I'm talking about the little guy
in my swimsuit.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.807
And I think it's time
for everybody to meet him.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.143
SPECTATORS (gasp): OOH.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.980
Welp, it was a good run.

18:35.982 --> 18:38.149
KLAUS:
Stop! You'll lose everything.

18:38.151 --> 18:40.718
This guy doesn't get
the attention he deserves.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.254
Maybe 'cause he's so small.
Prove it!

18:43.256 --> 18:46.624
'Scuse me. Sorry.
Just making my way out.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.259
I know how this ends.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.961
He gets a little shy.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.964
M-maybe if I stroke him a bit,
he'll pop his head out.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.632
That's so gross.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.135
I'm so cold.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.669
Are you a varsity athlete?

18:58.671 --> 19:00.805
No. My dad owns
a jacket company.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.107
Oh, my God. (giggles)

19:03.109 --> 19:05.309
Okay, everybody,
I see how this looks.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.346
I'm not a weirdo.
I just have a fish in my shorts.

19:08.348 --> 19:10.281
He's been helping me
get a jacket.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.817
Seemed like a good way
to get to second base.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.453
Thinking about
switching schools.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.955
(seabirds calling)

19:17.957 --> 19:20.091
I think she's ready.
Shipshape.

19:20.093 --> 19:24.328
Hey, guys! I'm so psyched you
invited me to take the boat out!

19:24.330 --> 19:26.631
Well, Jeff, we realized
how selfish we'd been,

19:26.633 --> 19:29.133
and we wanted to share
the boat-guy lifestyle

19:29.135 --> 19:30.601
with someone who'd
appreciate it.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.604
Awesome. So, can I cast off?

19:33.606 --> 19:36.007
You mean drive it?
Yeah, sure, knock yourself out.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.708
Hey, dad.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.645
Whoa! Hayley, Hayley, we just
invited Jeff to go sailing.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.680
But it's our anniversary.
Of what?

19:42.682 --> 19:44.282
Being married.

19:44.284 --> 19:47.385
And what better way to celebrate
than a sunset sail?

19:47.387 --> 19:49.020
Eh, mind the lines.

19:50.690 --> 19:55.059
(adventurous music playing)

20:04.137 --> 20:06.537
So that's what sailing's
supposed to look like.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.806
Would've been cool
if we'd done that.
Yeah.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.374
So, how long till
the boat sinks?

20:10.376 --> 20:12.243
Mm, as soon
as the painter's tape

20:12.245 --> 20:15.880
that's covering the big hole
in the bottom disintegrates.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.548
Well, let's go get 'em
and collect

20:17.550 --> 20:19.217
that sweet boat insurance.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.552
Boat insurance?
Who insures a boat?

20:21.554 --> 20:23.321
I thought the play was
life insurance.

20:23.323 --> 20:26.490
What?
I took out a very aggressive
policy on Jeff.

20:26.492 --> 20:28.426
Damn it, Roger,
we can't let them drown!

20:28.428 --> 20:32.163
It's, uh, it's actually a pretty
important part of the plan.

20:32.165 --> 20:34.332
The -- the, uh, crux,
if you will.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.833
Ugh, forget it. They lived.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.602
(both grunt)

20:37.604 --> 20:40.571
(panting) that was horrible!
The boat just sank!

20:40.573 --> 20:43.274
And the life jackets
didn't help at all!

20:43.276 --> 20:44.842
It's like they're filled
with sand.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.911
Roger!
It wasn't me!

20:46.913 --> 20:49.113
Wait a minute.
(click)

20:52.051 --> 20:53.618
Cocaine!

20:53.620 --> 20:55.886
Stan, do you know what
this means?!

20:55.888 --> 20:59.890
I sure do. It means all three
of you are going to prison.

20:59.892 --> 21:02.126
(click)
Wait, what?

21:02.128 --> 21:04.128
Bye! Have a beautiful time!
