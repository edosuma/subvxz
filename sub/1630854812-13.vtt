was lifted off of you?

I'm here with my friends.

my family,

something really big planned

a big deal,

it's not his birthday.

with Vinny so bad

with his birthday,

09:01.842 --> 09:03.377
and then throw him party.

to haircuts or leave him home?

are going to get haircuts,

14:45.752 --> 14:47.621
and more educated.

14:47.688 --> 14:49.623
How did you bag him?

14:49.690 --> 14:51.992
I think 2.0 is a standup guy.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.827
I think he's chill.

14:53.894 --> 14:56.230
He's smart.
He's got a master's degree.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.766
And Angelina seems
less Angelina around 2.0,

14:59.833 --> 15:01.668
which is awesome.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.570
You guys met each other
on the 'Gram?

15:03.637 --> 15:05.239
- She said they were
following each other

15:05.305 --> 15:07.174
for, like, a while, right?
- For a long time, yeah.

15:07.241 --> 15:09.009
- Who messaged who?

15:09.076 --> 15:11.144
- I think I was messaging him.
Like, I don't know.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.412
I have to go back
on the dates--

15:12.479 --> 15:14.181
- Like, last night,
he said, like--

15:14.248 --> 15:16.116
'cause I asked, like, "What
do you see with your future?"

15:16.183 --> 15:18.218
Like, what do you see
with your future with him?

15:18.285 --> 15:20.787
'Cause I know
you just got divorced.

15:20.854 --> 15:23.490
So do you see, like,
that type of future with him,

15:23.557 --> 15:25.025
or are you just
taking it very slowly?

15:25.092 --> 15:26.527
- Well, I've been
taking it slowly.

15:26.593 --> 15:27.895
I started dating him
in February.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.897
So I've been dating him
for a while

15:29.963 --> 15:31.398
before anyone even found out--

15:31.465 --> 15:33.066
- Yeah, 'cause in San Diego,
they were saying, like,

15:33.133 --> 15:35.202
he was there
watching your kitties.

15:35.269 --> 15:37.905
- Hi.
Are you in my garage?

15:37.971 --> 15:39.540
- Wait, time out.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.843
She's FaceTiming a guy
at her house in the garage.

15:42.910 --> 15:44.978
- Yeah, but that was--
- He was more of a friend?

15:45.045 --> 15:47.347
- No, we weren't--
we were never just friends.

15:47.414 --> 15:48.982
- Oh.
- I was just making it less

15:49.049 --> 15:51.618
than it was because I wanted
to protect that at first.

15:51.685 --> 15:53.387
- Yeah.
- I love that you put him

15:53.453 --> 15:55.122
on a pedestal.
- I definitely didn't

15:55.189 --> 15:56.423
put Chris on a pedestal,
I have to tell you that.

15:56.490 --> 15:59.092
- The king in your life
is your man.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.728
- My fiancé is the king
of the garbage men.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.330

16:03.397 --> 16:04.665
- No, you didn't.
- No.

also one of the issues.

It is my birthday.

'cause he's the Vinny pig.

Have a seat, bro.

- Good.

I'm not feeling the vibe.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.528
- I know you're not, yeah.

16:34.595 --> 16:37.464
- I need, like,
an old-school barber pole.

16:37.531 --> 16:38.465
- Yep.
- I need, like,

16:38.532 --> 16:40.234
a drug dealer to cut my hair.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.568
- Yeah, yeah.
- This is too nice.

16:41.635 --> 16:43.837
I don't really have
the greatest expectations

16:43.904 --> 16:45.038
going to a random barber shop.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.707
You know, I'm pretty picky.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.742
I would like a low fade,
not that high.

16:48.809 --> 16:51.178
You could do a half
at the bottom.

16:51.245 --> 16:55.082
I just get a fade, like a mid,
'cause I have thick hair.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.117
- How long
have you been a barber?

16:57.184 --> 16:58.318
- Nice.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.554
I don't know.

for tonight?

- Ah.

17:08.362 --> 17:10.564

17:10.631 --> 17:12.299

he's a very good guy.

17:12.366 --> 17:13.934
I know he'll be
a really good dad.

17:14.001 --> 17:15.235

17:15.302 --> 17:18.071
you would consider, like,
having children soon?

17:18.138 --> 17:20.941
- Like, 100% with him.

17:21.008 --> 17:22.809
So I had
a conversation with him

17:22.876 --> 17:24.745
about freezing my eggs
recently.

17:24.811 --> 17:27.347
- OK.
- He doesn't want that for me.

"Why would you freeze your eggs

17:28.782 --> 17:30.184

are considering that?

Oh, my God,
can we picture a pregnant Ange?

17:34.621 --> 17:35.822

- Like, soon?

17:37.891 --> 17:39.226
I just got goosebumps.

17:39.293 --> 17:40.427
- Did you really?
- Yes.

17:40.494 --> 17:42.663

17:42.729 --> 17:44.064
I'm not getting any younger.

17:44.131 --> 17:46.266

17:46.333 --> 17:47.901
as a woman,
to have a child.

17:47.968 --> 17:50.404

will not work anymore.

17:58.579 --> 18:01.782
Like, I had no idea
they were even this serious.

18:01.849 --> 18:04.952

your boyfriend?

18:05.018 --> 18:06.119
- No.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.421
- Are you, like,
girlfriend-boyfriend?

They really--they've
almost been dating a year.

18:16.363 --> 18:17.464
- That's what I'm saying.

18:17.531 --> 18:19.766
- I just hope
that she understands

18:19.833 --> 18:23.103
the pace that she's set
'cause, you know,

18:23.170 --> 18:24.838
she's doing
all these side things,

like hitting on our Vinny and
trying to, like, be with him,

18:28.208 --> 18:31.311

a pace with Vinny 2.0,

18:31.378 --> 18:33.514
who might not know that
she's doing all those things.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.616
- I would probably
do stuff very quickly.

18:35.682 --> 18:36.783
- Next year?

18:36.850 --> 18:38.919
- Yeah, 100%.

22:27.981 --> 22:30.083
"Dancing with the Stars."
It's a mirrorball trophy.

22:30.150 --> 22:32.719
So it's basically just
a shiny disco ball...

22:32.786 --> 22:34.888
- With "Dancing"--
- On a trophy with--

22:34.955 --> 22:37.224
- "Number One Chooch."
- That would be cute.

22:37.291 --> 22:38.592
- How do you spell "chooch"?
- It's not like coochie.

22:38.659 --> 22:39.760
- C-H-O-O-C-H.
- Choochie.

22:39.826 --> 22:42.462
- Yeah, C-H-O-O-C-H.
- C-H-O-O-C-H.

22:42.529 --> 22:43.597
- Just please
don't write "coochie" on there.

22:43.664 --> 22:45.699
- I can't listen
to 10,000 people.

22:45.766 --> 22:47.301

My hangover is awful today,

for Vinny's birthday party.

23:12.459 --> 23:14.127
We have to get decorations
for the ballroom.

23:14.194 --> 23:15.662
We got to make it,
like, nice and pretty.

23:15.729 --> 23:17.598
We need balloons.
We need signs.

23:17.664 --> 23:19.333
I just wish
we weren't so hungover

23:19.399 --> 23:22.002
because we have to make
this birthday party look legit.

a very important cut for me.

That's for the Vinny 2.0, man.

24:55.362 --> 24:57.397
- We're gonna collab here, OK?
- A'ight, let's collab.

24:57.464 --> 24:58.899
- He has to interview
the barber first.

24:58.966 --> 25:01.201
- I know you're not
my barber and whatever.

25:01.268 --> 25:02.336
This is all crazy.

25:02.402 --> 25:03.837
- After he interviews
the barber,

25:03.904 --> 25:05.205
then he still has to decide

25:05.272 --> 25:06.573
if he's actually gonna
use this barber or not.

25:06.640 --> 25:07.841
- Like a low fade.

25:07.908 --> 25:10.110
And I say keep it lower,
just in case.

25:10.177 --> 25:11.512
And a skin fade too.

25:11.578 --> 25:13.080
A line right here.

25:13.146 --> 25:15.082
- Then he'll describe
the actual beard.

25:15.148 --> 25:17.618
- Really, I keep it
as high as possible here.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.686
- Vinny, the one
with the shortest hair,

25:19.753 --> 25:21.488
is taking the longest
in the barber chair.

25:21.555 --> 25:24.391
- The edges can be
just a little bit more.

25:24.458 --> 25:25.959
- People think
that I'm the hair guy?

25:26.026 --> 25:27.127
No, it's Vinny.

25:27.194 --> 25:28.462
He takes forever
to get his hair done.

25:28.529 --> 25:29.897
I'm gonna miss my show tonight.

25:31.632 --> 25:32.866
- I'm dying over here.

25:32.933 --> 25:34.067
- Why are you dying?
What happened?

25:34.134 --> 25:36.003
- 'Cause I didn't shower.
- Smelly ass.

25:36.069 --> 25:38.338
- So this is gonna be
Vinny's rehearsal room.

25:38.405 --> 25:39.940
- This is it?
- Yeah.

25:40.007 --> 25:41.942
- It smells like
a medical center.

25:42.009 --> 25:43.977
- Why did I expect,
like, a huge ballroom?

25:44.044 --> 25:45.979
This place,
it doesn't look great.

25:46.046 --> 25:48.682
I feel like if we were
to actually throw something,

25:48.749 --> 25:50.617
it would be, like,
in a grand ballroom.

25:50.684 --> 25:51.852
There'd be chandeliers.

25:51.919 --> 25:54.154
- This kind of
looks like a crack den.

25:54.221 --> 25:56.623
- And this looks like where
you go and sit for AA meetings.

25:56.690 --> 25:58.625
I mean, it's not great.
- OK, guys.

25:58.692 --> 26:00.961
Let's decorate this bitch.
- Now we got to decorate.

26:03.597 --> 26:05.365
- Hey, Pauly,
remember you said before,

26:05.432 --> 26:06.900
if you wanted me
to do a blowout tonight

26:06.967 --> 26:09.336
since it's Pauly D Day,
but I went back in the archives

26:09.403 --> 26:10.971
when I used to have hair
just like yours, man,

26:11.038 --> 26:12.573
and I used to wear
that [bleep] every day.

26:12.639 --> 26:14.208
I can show you a picture of it?
- Yeah, you got a picture?

26:14.274 --> 26:15.843
- Maybe give me
your rating on it?

26:15.909 --> 26:17.578
- Yeah, let me see this.
Oh, my.

26:17.644 --> 26:19.146
Damn, that's a good one.

26:19.213 --> 26:21.348
Oh, wow, look at that.

26:21.415 --> 26:24.084
- Listen, listen, listen,
all these jokes

26:24.151 --> 26:25.886
about the new Vinny
are cool and [bleep],

26:25.953 --> 26:27.487
but don't flirt
with my man Pauly.

26:27.554 --> 26:28.956
- Wow.
- No, no, no, no, no.

26:29.022 --> 26:30.090
This is going too far.

26:30.157 --> 26:31.892
- Mind your business, man.

26:31.959 --> 26:33.393
- Okey-doke.

26:33.460 --> 26:36.129
I don't know how to,
like, tie the balloons.

26:36.196 --> 26:38.498
- In general,
us moms are really good

26:38.565 --> 26:40.667
at decorating
and throwing a party.

26:40.734 --> 26:42.703
- Why don't we put "chooch"
on the wall?

26:42.769 --> 26:43.937
It's a little lopsided, Nicole.

26:44.004 --> 26:45.706
- This looks terrible.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.741
- But this is
not our best work.

it is probably a ghost.

to Mike's corny T-shirt lines

28:30.511 --> 28:32.613

to do for my birthday.

expect life to be sweet, man.

We need to turn this around and
make this room look amazing.

look nice,

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:21.595 --> 29:22.963

Give that to Vinny.

29:23.030 --> 29:24.464
- Oh, my bad.
Hold on.

29:24.531 --> 29:25.832
This is so ridiculous.

29:25.899 --> 29:27.868
Obviously, it's a joke,
but at this point,

29:27.935 --> 29:30.137
these people have
not acknowledged

29:30.204 --> 29:31.805
my birthday
for so long...

29:31.872 --> 29:33.507
- Here, give that to Vinny.
It's his birthday on Sunday.

29:33.574 --> 29:35.175
- I think, like,
they started to believe it.

29:35.242 --> 29:36.643
Like, they don't know
how to acknowledge my birthday.

29:36.710 --> 29:38.478
- All right, boys, let's go.
- Let's do it.

29:38.545 --> 29:40.047
My man. Got the man
with the plan right there.

29:40.113 --> 29:41.381

29:41.448 --> 29:43.517
- It looks really great
in here, guys.

29:43.584 --> 29:46.153
Just really, really ugly.

29:46.220 --> 29:48.322
This party sucks.

29:48.388 --> 29:49.857
- All right, guys.

29:49.923 --> 29:51.558
- Oh, please tell me
this looks nice.

29:53.927 --> 29:55.362
