WEBVTT

00:25.984 --> 00:27.569
-Hey, kids.
-How was school?

00:27.652 --> 00:30.280
Did you dazzle your teachers?
Did you make a big splash?

00:30.363 --> 00:31.865
GENE: I sure did. Center stall.

00:31.948 --> 00:33.450
About 12 minutes after lunch.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.118
-Up top, big guy.
-Mm.

00:35.201 --> 00:37.412
Well, it was actually a pretty
slow day here today.

00:37.495 --> 00:38.997
Wait, here? No.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.124
It was slow, and so, Tina,

00:41.207 --> 00:42.542
guess who had time to work on our costumes

00:42.625 --> 00:44.502
for our father-daughter movie date

00:44.586 --> 00:47.380
to see <i>Vampire Disco Death Dance</i>
tomorrow night?

00:47.464 --> 00:49.424
You? Wait, is this a trick question?

00:49.507 --> 00:51.259
It was me. And your mom helped, too.

00:51.343 --> 00:52.969
I did most of it, and your father just had

00:53.053 --> 00:54.220
a lot of opinions.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.056
It's not fair. Why don't Gene and I

00:56.139 --> 00:57.599
get to go see a vampire movie?

00:57.682 --> 00:58.850
Well, it's not just a movie.

00:58.933 --> 01:01.978
It's a dress-up-sing-along
interactive experience.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.065
There's an emcee,
people talk back to the screen.

01:05.148 --> 01:07.192
At one point, people even throw confetti.

01:07.275 --> 01:10.320
But you guys are a little too young.
It-It's rated R.

01:10.403 --> 01:11.571
What, for violence?

01:11.654 --> 01:14.324
Well, there's a couple swears,
and a character gets drunk,

01:14.407 --> 01:17.410
and there's a lot of innuendo.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.871
We see stuff like that
every day with you and Mom.

01:19.954 --> 01:21.581
But it's definitely not violent.

01:21.664 --> 01:23.041
There's not even any blood in it.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.167
It's-it's campy.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.336
No blood? Oh. Now I don't want to go.

01:26.419 --> 01:27.754
Trust me, you're missing out.

01:27.837 --> 01:30.131
It's about this
18-year-old farmer named Kevin.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.926
-I like that.
-Kevin works on his mean dad's
garlic farm,

01:33.009 --> 01:34.135
but what he really wants to do

01:34.219 --> 01:35.679
is go to a disco nightclub

01:35.762 --> 01:38.264
that turns out to be run by vampires.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.642
That's where Kevin meets Destiny Fanger,

01:40.725 --> 01:43.061
-the costume that Tina's gonna wear.
-Yeah, check it out.

01:43.144 --> 01:45.605
I sewed a long-sleeve shirt
onto a pair of pants,

01:45.689 --> 01:47.065
glued a bunch of sequins all over it,

01:47.148 --> 01:50.235
and now it's a jumpsuit.
My little disco death dancer.

01:50.318 --> 01:52.362
I want to see the crap out of this movie.

01:52.445 --> 01:53.780
Well, when you're 13, I'll take you.

01:53.863 --> 01:55.281
It-It'll be like a rite of passage.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.783
I saw it when I was 13.

01:56.866 --> 01:58.159
-Oh, it's old?
-BOB: Yeah.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.703
-Gross.
-Yeah. Ew.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.454
Well, Tina's excited
for our father-daughter

02:01.538 --> 02:03.164
movie date tomorrow night, right?

02:03.248 --> 02:06.001
What?
Oh, yeah, it's, uh, gonna be really fun.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.378
Um, why are you drinking like that?

02:08.461 --> 02:09.504
Some kids at school have been playing

02:09.587 --> 02:10.672
this new game they made up.

02:10.755 --> 02:12.382
It's called drinking or not drinking.

02:12.465 --> 02:13.633
What is it?
How do you play?

02:13.717 --> 02:14.843
You put a straw in your drink,

02:14.926 --> 02:16.344
then you put the straw in your mouth.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.054
And then people have to guess
if you're drinking

02:18.138 --> 02:19.556
or not drinking.

02:19.639 --> 02:22.017
-Hmm.
-Do you guys know about fun games?

02:22.100 --> 02:23.476
It's dumb!
It's a dumb game!

02:23.560 --> 02:25.270
But I'm realizing the kids I hang out with

02:25.353 --> 02:27.022
are kind of my only shot at a peer group,

02:27.105 --> 02:28.648
so I'm just making the best of it.

02:28.732 --> 02:30.066
Aw, sweetie.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.484
I mean, I wish I had a group of friends

02:31.568 --> 02:33.486
that were all really close
and shared our deepest hopes

02:33.570 --> 02:35.071
and desires and we all got each other.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.656
But it doesn't look like
things are going that way,

02:36.740 --> 02:38.241
so these kids are my best option.

02:38.324 --> 02:41.411
And that means I've got practice
drinking and/or not drinking.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.455
Hmm, it looks like
you're holding in a fart.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.081
It looks like you're holding in a stroke.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.916
Well, it sounds like
tomorrow night will be

02:47.000 --> 02:49.210
a good break from your super great

02:49.294 --> 02:50.837
not terrible at all group.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.088
-TINA: Mm-hmm.
-(liquid gurgling)

02:52.172 --> 02:53.631
Tina, please stop doing that
with your face.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.425
It-It's scaring me.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.762
All right, that was a good one.
Let's play another round.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.306
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-Cool. So fun.

03:01.389 --> 03:04.351
My turn.
Everyone look at me.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.560
Oh, she's drinking, baby.

03:05.643 --> 03:07.145
Zeke, I don't think she is.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.064
Wait, now I don't think she is, either.

03:09.147 --> 03:11.858
-Dang, she's good.
-Yeah, crazy. Wow.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.985
Oh, my God, she's totally drinking.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.987
You're right, I was drinking.

03:16.071 --> 03:19.115
I knew it.
In your faces and your places.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.409
-My turn.
-Oh, cool, cool. Playing again.

03:21.493 --> 03:22.911
I just saw a little milk on his lips.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.537
He's drinking, baby!

03:24.621 --> 03:26.539
(chuckles)
Get over here, you little drinker stinker.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.208
-I'm gonna... Get over here.
-(gasping)

03:28.291 --> 03:30.418
Zeke, you made milk come out of my nose.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.754
Ha! Let's never not play this game.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.589
This game is, like, who we are.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.011
Don't cut off your fingers,
don't cut off your fingers,

03:40.095 --> 03:41.137
-Oh, my God.
-don't cu... Wha?

03:41.221 --> 03:43.139
-Wha? Wha?
-Somebody dumped a bunch of junk

03:43.223 --> 03:45.684
-in our alley last night.
-Ooh, it's nasty.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.519
Oh, look at the little baby table

03:47.602 --> 03:49.187
with the little baby chairs.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.438
Oh, they're kind of moldy.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.399
Aw, but they're so little and cute.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.526
Pickup is in a few days.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.444
I need to get all this junk
inside the dumpster,

03:56.528 --> 03:58.613
-or else they won't take it.
-I'll help you.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.115
Let's get this junk in the trunk.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.783
We're really gonna
have to mush it in there

04:01.866 --> 04:03.159
to get the dumpster to close all the way.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.911
Or else the raccoons will come tonight

04:04.994 --> 04:07.706
and rip open all the trash bags
and make an even bigger mess.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.583
Oh, God forbid the raccoons
should have a little fun.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.836
Lin, I know that they're your friends.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.255
It's just, they do make a mess. It's rude.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.549
You-you maybe shouldn't
be friends with them.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.135
Hey, what if they ate
at the little moldy table?

04:20.218 --> 04:21.720
Like a little raccoon restaurant.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.847
Linda, please, just help me mush.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.390
Raccoons sitting on little chairs,

04:25.473 --> 04:27.267
using little knives and forks.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.019
Aw, we should do that.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.979
I mean, maybe not.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.731
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
That'd be crazy.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.566
All right, hold my apron, I'm going in.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.570
I can't climb up.
What's wrong with me?

04:38.653 --> 04:41.740
-Am I not strong?
-I'll give you a boost. (grunting)

04:41.823 --> 04:43.158
Thank you.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.993
-Guys, wait.
-What?

04:45.076 --> 04:46.244
-Wait.
-What?

04:46.327 --> 04:48.663
We should play drinking or not drinking

04:48.747 --> 04:51.499
-somewhere tonight.
-Oh, my God, yes.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.918
-Hell yeah.
-I'm so in.
-Dang.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.588
I really do want to hang out
with my crew tonight--

04:56.671 --> 04:58.340
that's you guys--
but I already have plans.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.925
Plans?
Wh-What do you mean? With who?

05:01.009 --> 05:02.344
My dad's taking me to see a movie.

05:02.427 --> 05:03.428
Ugh. Why?

05:03.511 --> 05:05.555
It's an old vampire movie.
It's a musical.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.807
We're dressing up in costume
like two of the characters.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.684
People sing and talk back to the screen.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.061
The screen can hear you?

05:11.144 --> 05:13.271
Uh, it can't hear you, Jocelyn, no.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.023
Oh, my God, I thought...
Oh, my God, good.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.775
Oh, and it's rated R.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.276
-Do what?
-What?

05:18.360 --> 05:20.070
-Damn.
Yeah.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.905
All right, good mushing.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.782
I think it'll close now.
I-I hope.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.575
Hey, look--
someone threw away Mom and Dad.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.744
Ooh, now we can get fresh, new parents.

05:27.827 --> 05:30.330
-Maybe hairless, smooth ones.
-Hi, kids.

05:30.413 --> 05:33.458
Donâ€™t worry, Tina, I-I'm gonna
shower before the movie tonight.

05:33.541 --> 05:36.127
-Oh, so now you shower.
-Hey, Dad, guess what.
-What?

05:36.211 --> 05:37.587
I told Zeke, Jimmy Junior,
Tammy and Jocelyn

05:37.671 --> 05:39.214
about the movie, and now
they want to come, too.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.966
-Um, they do?
-Yes. At first they just wanted to play

05:42.050 --> 05:43.301
the stupid drinking game tonight,

05:43.385 --> 05:45.220
but now they want to do something
I want to do.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.222
-They're gonna buy tickets for the movie.
-Wait. Really?

05:47.305 --> 05:49.182
So now maybe we'll all start
liking the same things,

05:49.265 --> 05:50.350
and I'll never need any new friends.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.476
It's all thanks to you, Dad.

05:51.559 --> 05:53.186
And you get to pick everybody up tonight

05:53.269 --> 05:54.479
and drive us all there and chaperone us.

05:54.562 --> 05:57.273
-Thanks. I love you.
-Great.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.443
<i>TINA:</i>
<i>This is gonna be</i>

06:00.527 --> 06:01.861
a good night, Dad.
Hey, you're okay

06:01.945 --> 06:02.946
with all of my friends

06:03.029 --> 06:04.114
coming with us, right?

06:04.197 --> 06:05.740
Uh, yeah.
Uh, definitely.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.784
Oh, you're gonna
have such a good time, Dad.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.285
Tammy is a treat.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.413
She's fine if you just
think about something else

06:11.496 --> 06:13.790
-when she starts talking.
-Tina, please try not to move.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.668
-I-I'm doing your makeup really well.
-Eh.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.796
Okay, so Tina's a vampire lady
with slightly thicker eyebrows.

06:19.879 --> 06:20.839
Dad, who are you?

06:20.922 --> 06:22.757
I'm Nightclub Guy Number Three.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.509
He only has one line,
but everybody in the audience

06:24.592 --> 06:25.760
yells it at the screen.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.846
-What's his line?
-It's right before he dies.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.306
He yells, "Dis-go to hell, vampires."

06:30.390 --> 06:32.434
Wow. I'm surprised this movie
didn't get banned

06:32.517 --> 06:33.852
with that edgy stuff.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.270
Well, I'm pumped.
Woo-hoo!

06:35.353 --> 06:37.397
And done.
I-I think.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.774
All right, get out of here, you two.
Love you.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.026
And we're not gonna do anything weird

06:41.109 --> 06:42.652
-with raccoons in the alley.
-Wait. What?

06:42.736 --> 06:44.863
What? No. Just...
Bye. Bye, bye, bye.

06:44.946 --> 06:47.157
-Oh, God. Let-Let's just go.
-Have fun.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.576
And, Mommy, Louise,
you might want to get out of here, too.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.578
-It's showtime.
-Oh, my God, you're pooping.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.663
-Ugh, yeah, he is.
-What? That was the plan,

06:53.747 --> 06:55.373
and then everyone came in here!

06:55.457 --> 06:57.959
Wait, Tina, why do you look like that?

06:58.043 --> 07:00.003
-Are you goth now?
-Aw. Don't be goth.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.922
-You're already so sad.
-(sighs)

07:03.006 --> 07:04.924
Remember, everybody?
I said it was a singalong dress-up thing?

07:05.008 --> 07:06.468
It's fine.
It's not a big deal.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.136
I mean, it's not <i>not</i> a big deal.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.305
It's kind of part of the whole thing.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.890
What are you dressed up as, Mr. B?

07:11.973 --> 07:13.641
You look like an old-ass
Burt Reynolds or something.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.060
My stepmom Cheryl lets me say "ass"

07:15.143 --> 07:16.603
and a couple of other curses now.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.189
-Hope that's cool with you.
-No, I don't like it.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.648
There's a red light coming up.

07:20.732 --> 07:23.526
-Uh, thanks, Jimmy. I-I see it.
-I couldn't tell

07:23.610 --> 07:25.653
if you were paying attention.
You look sleepy.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.073
I-I'm not sleepy.
I'm... I'm just old.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.325
Guys, when we stop,
we should yell something

07:30.408 --> 07:32.494
at the people in the car next to us.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.872
-Oh, my God, that'd be so funny.
-No, ple-please don't yell at...

07:35.955 --> 07:37.457
Hey, person in the car.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.541
I like your shirt.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.293
Oh, my God, he looked at me.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.545
-Drive, drive, drive.
-I-I can't. It's a red light.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.255
Remember?
You pointed it out.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.007
-You okay, Dad?
-Yup. Yup.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.759
I'm doing great, Tina.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.469
<i>LINDA:</i>
<i>All right, we got the dirty little</i>

07:49.552 --> 07:51.638
table and chairs all set up in the alley.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.640
Now we need to finish cooking
the raccoons their dinner.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.475
And then we can open up their restaurant.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.894
So, just to double-check here,
we're making a restaurant

07:57.977 --> 08:00.021
-in our alley for raccoons?
-Exactly.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.856
-I love this lady.
-Here, Gene, stir.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.316
And we're cooking them real food

08:03.400 --> 08:05.694
because Dad said he didn't
want them to eat our trash?

08:05.777 --> 08:07.987
Yes. And they work hard
just like anyone else,

08:08.071 --> 08:10.573
and they deserve to have a hot meal
and a nice atmosphere.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.743
-And I bet they tip great.
-Okay, here's how this is gonna work.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.495
We're serving spaghetti.
We're gonna plate it up here

08:15.578 --> 08:17.122
and carry the food down to the alley.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.708
We've got three chairs,
and I'm betting we have a full house

08:19.791 --> 08:20.875
for opening night.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.836
Sorry, I keep having questions.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.964
How do we get raccoons to sit in chairs?

08:26.047 --> 08:28.967
They're not animals.
They know how to sit in chairs.

08:29.050 --> 08:31.469
Gene, you're on music duty.
I'm thinking something jazzy.

08:31.553 --> 08:34.472
On it. I'll bring my keyboard.
I'll learn jazz.

08:34.556 --> 08:35.890
Louise, you're gonna help with atmosphere.

08:35.974 --> 08:37.559
That means you're on candle duty.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.060
You get to use matches.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.311
Okay, I like this now.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.856
All right!
Let's resta this raunt.

08:42.939 --> 08:44.899
JIMMY:
Uh, Mr. Belcher?

08:44.983 --> 08:47.610
So, you're still, like, here,

08:47.694 --> 08:50.196
with us, like, outside of your car.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.824
-Is that on purpose?
-What? Um, yeah.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.243
-Uh, I'm coming with you guys.
-Oh...

08:55.326 --> 08:56.786
Okay. Okay.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.663
Did you think I got dressed up like this

08:58.747 --> 09:00.582
just to drop you off at the movie theater?

09:00.665 --> 09:01.666
-Yeah.
-Yes.
-Yup.

09:01.750 --> 09:02.959
(whispers):
Tina, do something.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.753
It's rated R.
He has to come with us.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.671
Ugh. Fart noise.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.798
-(farts)
-Oh. (chuckles)
That's actually weird, 'cause that...

09:08.882 --> 09:11.968
then there <i>was</i> a sound,
but that's... it wasn't from me.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.387
-Cool. Lot of costumes.
-Yeah. Oh. That guy's

09:14.471 --> 09:16.639
dressed up as Vamp von Tramp,
the vampire gigolo.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.141
Hey, look.
It's Dominic.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.935
Oh, hey, Bob, and all the teens
Bob is hanging out with.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.645
Oh, no.
We're not hanging out.

09:22.729 --> 09:23.980
I-I'm chaperoning.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.024
So, <i>Vampire Disco Death Dance</i> night.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.109
-Are you excited?
-Sure. I love being the guy

09:28.193 --> 09:30.320
that cleans up after a movie
where people throw stuff

09:30.403 --> 09:31.654
all around the theater.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.948
Oh.
Well, um, uh, nice to see you.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.618
And sorry about the mess
that we're all about to make.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.370
It's all right.
I wanted a job in showbiz.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.789
Okay, let's go in
and try and grab some good seats

09:40.872 --> 09:42.332
-while we can.
-Hold up, Mr. B.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.833
Sweet kids need sweet treats.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.835
Should we get in the snack line, or...?

09:45.919 --> 09:48.088
-Yeah, we should.
-Tina, why don't we go in

09:48.171 --> 09:50.298
-and save some seats.
-All right, get some snacks,

09:50.382 --> 09:52.926
and then let's watch this thing
and have some fun with it.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.344
Sound good, kid crew?

09:54.427 --> 09:56.096
Did you just say "kid crew"?

09:56.179 --> 09:57.806
Yeah, it just came out.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.100
Uh, maybe it's like a name
for our little group.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.976
Kid Krew.
Spelled with a K.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.688
(chuckles) I-I don't know.
Never mind. Uh, see you in there.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.189
Hey, you funky chickens.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.234
Grab a seat and hang on to your necks!

10:09.317 --> 10:12.028
-Is he talking to us?
-They-they greet everyone like that.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.905
Oh, hey, let's grab those over there.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.198
You think they'll find us up here?

10:15.281 --> 10:16.574
They'll be able to see us, right?

10:16.658 --> 10:17.992
We're not blocking you, are we,

10:18.076 --> 10:19.661
with our giant spider hair?

10:19.744 --> 10:21.329
Oh, no, uh, you're fine.

10:21.413 --> 10:23.331
I like your costume, Destiny.

10:23.415 --> 10:24.958
Thanks, uh, spider person.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.918
Sorry I don't know the movie
that well yet.

10:27.002 --> 10:28.795
-So, kind of cool, right?
-Really cool.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.755
I think the Kid Crew's gonna be into it,

10:30.839 --> 10:32.799
once they handle that snack attack.
(chuckles)

10:32.882 --> 10:34.384
(high-pitched):
Hoo-hoo.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.011
It's starting!

10:39.472 --> 10:41.725
AUDIENCE:
Whoa!

10:41.808 --> 10:43.810
Whoa. I'm dizzy.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.231
Go to sleep, Kevin!

10:48.314 --> 10:50.984
And turn off that music!

10:51.067 --> 10:52.986
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

10:53.069 --> 10:54.320
<i>Dang it, Kevin.</i>

10:54.404 --> 10:56.698
<i>You've got garlic to pick in the morning.</i>

10:57.907 --> 10:59.325
Kind of a waste of garlic.
But it's fun.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.577
But-but I don't do it.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.828
Sorry, Dad.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.413
I was just practicing
my bus stop a little bit.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.622
I think it's really gettin' there.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.082
Yeah, it is.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.584
<i>FARMER KEITH:</i>
<i>You and your dang disco dancing.</i>

11:07.667 --> 11:08.626
Where are they?

11:10.086 --> 11:12.255
Hello, fire.
I made you.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.840
Now I'm gonna put you here.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.467
Here...

11:15.550 --> 11:16.885
and here.

11:16.968 --> 11:19.637
I control you.
I am the lord of light.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.765
Okay, okay, Louise.
Put out the match.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.683
Why?
Just 'cause it's about to burn my fingers?

11:23.767 --> 11:25.393
Oh, okay, I'm doing it now.
Ow.

11:25.477 --> 11:28.438
(clears throat)
Yesterday, I had a little idea

11:28.521 --> 11:30.398
to use a small, moldy table

11:30.482 --> 11:32.525
to create a restaurant for raccoons.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.945
And tonight, Alley Rascals
is open for business, baby.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.365
-Yeah!
-(chanting): Mommy! Mommy!

11:38.448 --> 11:39.699
Raccoons!

11:39.783 --> 11:41.659
We got spaghetti and jazz in the alley.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.244
Gene, go.
Jazz, now.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.831
-â™ª <i>Jazzity-jazz-jazz-jazz...</i> â™ª
-All right, let's crouch down

11:46.915 --> 11:48.625
next to the dumpster
so we don't scare 'em.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.001
Gene, did you write that song?

11:50.085 --> 11:51.670
No, but I bought the rights to it.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.006
-What's taking so long?
<i>-WOMAN: Hello.</i>

11:55.090 --> 11:57.050
<i>I didn't know boy legs could do that.</i>

11:57.133 --> 11:59.928
<i>I'm Destiny.</i>
<i>Want to dance with Destiny?</i>

12:00.011 --> 12:02.555
<i>Sure, uh, let me just</i>
<i>re-cinch my overalls.</i>

12:02.639 --> 12:05.433
<i>Those overalls and me</i>
<i>have something in common.</i>

12:05.517 --> 12:07.143
<i>'Cause I'm gonna be all over you.</i>

12:07.227 --> 12:08.770
Tina, there's your character.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.021
It's Destiny.
Look.

12:10.105 --> 12:12.023
-What?
-It's Destiny. There she is.

12:12.107 --> 12:13.608
-Great. Great.
-Hey, are you okay?

12:13.692 --> 12:15.235
-Yeah. I'm fine.
-This song is called,

12:15.318 --> 12:16.820
"I'm All Over You."
It's really good.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.294
<i>Wait, you're gonna do what?</i>

12:43.471 --> 12:45.974
<i>Um, why do you smell like garlic?</i>

12:46.057 --> 12:47.308
AUDIENCE:
Uh-oh.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.519
<i>There might be a little</i>
<i>garlic on my overalls.</i>

12:49.602 --> 12:51.229
<i>Why don't you go ahead and take those off?</i>

12:51.312 --> 12:53.732
<i>I want to see what's under those overalls.</i>

12:53.815 --> 12:54.733
<i>Okay.</i>

12:54.816 --> 12:56.234
Oh, wow.

13:01.156 --> 13:02.866
I'm just gonna go check on them.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.367
Hey, don't you love this song?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.244
I'm so excited we're seeing this together.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.872
Oh. And you're... you're gone.
Oh, uh...

13:16.171 --> 13:17.672
-There you are.
-Where have you been?

13:17.756 --> 13:19.382
Where have I been?
I've been watching the movie.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.967
What are you guys doing out here?

13:21.051 --> 13:22.886
We're doing a lightning round
of, uh-- oh, I don't know...

13:22.969 --> 13:24.471
-(imitates slurping)
-Drugs?
-What?

13:24.554 --> 13:26.097
-Drinking or not drinking.
-Right.

13:26.181 --> 13:28.266
Tina, play.
Come on.

13:28.350 --> 13:30.143
The-the movie... started.
Remember?

13:30.226 --> 13:31.561
The thing we came to see?

13:31.644 --> 13:33.438
It's fine, Tina.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.732
It's okay if that old movie
gets a little older.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.025
(scoffs)
Do you want to play or what?

13:37.108 --> 13:38.401
Here, use mine.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.278
TAMMY:
Tina. Don't be a poop smear. Play.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.364
Ugh. Okay.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.531
ZEKE:
Uh, drinking.

13:43.615 --> 13:44.699
Not drinking.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.493
Damn, this game keeps you on your toes.

13:46.576 --> 13:47.744
I was drinking.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.705
Oh, wow. Wasn't gonna guess that.
Crazy.

13:50.789 --> 13:52.123
Sit down, Tina.
Get comfortable.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.877
Okay, okay, okay!
My turn.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.046
Wait, is it weird if you can't breathe
when you're drinking?

13:58.129 --> 14:00.131
Mm. Yes.
You should have that looked at.

14:00.215 --> 14:01.633
<i>I don't know, Destiny.</i>

14:01.716 --> 14:05.011
<i>Your teeth are so sharp.</i>
<i>I'm all... turned around.</i>

14:05.095 --> 14:06.721
-(laughter)
-I love that part.

14:06.805 --> 14:08.723
Huh.
Still not back.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.892
Ooh.
I <i>was</i> drinking.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.353
-Oopsie. (giggles)
-Hey, I have a fun idea.

14:13.436 --> 14:14.562
We could all go in and watch the movie.

14:14.646 --> 14:15.689
It's really good.
I mean,

14:15.772 --> 14:17.857
the innuendos are so innuendo-y.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.193
And Jimmy Jr., it's very dance-y

14:20.276 --> 14:21.528
and-and the main character
has some daddy-issue stuff.

14:21.611 --> 14:22.570
That's your kind of fun.

14:22.654 --> 14:23.822
Sounds pretty cool, right?

14:23.905 --> 14:25.115
Cooler than this?

14:25.198 --> 14:26.408
Cooler than playing

14:26.491 --> 14:27.909
drinking or not drinking on a staircase?

14:27.992 --> 14:28.952
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.495
The movie does sound pretty cool.

14:30.578 --> 14:31.871
-Maybe we should check it out.
-All right. Great.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.957
Kid Crew is doing this.
Let's go.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.042
We're coming!
Stop yelling at us.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.544
And stop saying Kid Crew.

14:37.627 --> 14:38.628
Teen Troupe?

14:38.712 --> 14:40.046
Um, maybe.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.466
-â™ª <i>Jazzy-jazz-jazz.</i> â™ª
-Oh. Look.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.968
We've got customers.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.594
Time to go smooth jazz.

14:49.139 --> 14:50.682
It's Big Baby Pudding Snatcher,

14:50.765 --> 14:53.143
Little King Trashmouth
and his husband Gary!

14:55.270 --> 14:56.479
Yeah.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.064
Oh, my God,
he's gonna sit in the little chair.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.566
No, wait, he's just standin' on it.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.151
But still.
Oh, it's so cute.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.486
Whoa. They are going to town
on that pasta.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.654
They're eating fast.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.322
They must have tickets to the opera.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.700
Or maybe they have to catch
a flight to Bonnaroo.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.410
Will you look at them?
They love it.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.328
This is so much better
than our other restaurant.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.122
The one that serves food to humans?

15:14.205 --> 15:15.874
That place is garbage.

15:15.957 --> 15:18.001
-JOCELYN (whispering): Tammy.
-What?

15:18.084 --> 15:19.461
-Tammy.
-What?

15:19.544 --> 15:20.920
Is that a vampire?

15:21.004 --> 15:23.089
-Ya-huh, Jocelyn. Yes.
-Oh. Okay.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.674
Wait, what about her?
Is she a vampire?

15:24.758 --> 15:25.759
Yes.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.427
Wait, is this movie about vampires?

15:27.510 --> 15:29.804
Yes. It's about vampires.
Shush.

15:29.888 --> 15:32.515
Hey, J-Ju. Look at this
crazy-shaped gummy bear.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.893
(laughing)
What the heck?

15:34.976 --> 15:36.478
It doesn't even look like a bear.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.438
This bear's had a lot of work done.
(laughs)

15:38.521 --> 15:41.066
Did it just come like that?
This is so interesting.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.442
I just pulled it out of the bag

15:42.525 --> 15:44.694
and I was all like, "do what?"
(laughs)

15:44.778 --> 15:45.820
Okay, I'm gonna eat it.

15:45.904 --> 15:47.697
No. Zeke, you can't eat it.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.115
-It's special.
-I'm eatin' it.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.200
-Don't.
-I'm doin' it.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.951
-No. Zeke...
-(grunting)

15:52.035 --> 15:53.495
-Guys, come on.
-Shush!

15:53.578 --> 15:55.288
Aw, they're almost finished.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.499
Gary's just nibbling on his last noodles.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.626
LOUISE: Looks like Big Baby
Pudding Snatcher's still hungry.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.003
She's really staring at Gary's spaghetti.

16:02.087 --> 16:03.338
It feels a little... tense.

16:03.421 --> 16:04.589
-Oh, no.
-What?

16:04.673 --> 16:06.424
LINDA: I think they're about to fight.

16:06.508 --> 16:08.635
G-Gary!
No biting! No biting!

16:08.718 --> 16:10.762
No! No!
Oh, come on. Please.

16:10.845 --> 16:11.763
Rac attack!

16:11.846 --> 16:13.098
LOUISE:
Fire!

16:13.181 --> 16:14.849
-Oh, my plates!
-(Gene gasps)

16:14.933 --> 16:16.935
I'll try to calm them down with music.

16:18.687 --> 16:19.938
Gene, that's making it worse.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.440
Oh, no.
I made their fight funkier.

16:22.524 --> 16:23.983
Guys.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.735
Drinking or not drinking?

16:25.819 --> 16:27.404
Jimmy Jr., just watch the movie.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.155
Tina, don't be a pee stain.

16:29.239 --> 16:30.865
1,000% not drinking.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.450
-Guys.
-I know your not-drinkin' face.

16:32.534 --> 16:33.493
You're not drinkin', J-Ju.

16:33.576 --> 16:34.619
-Fess up.
-Guys.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.705
No, he's drinking.
For sure.

16:36.788 --> 16:39.290
-Oh, my God.
-Tina, what is your pube-lem?

16:39.374 --> 16:40.625
Stop it!
You guys are being so annoying!

16:40.709 --> 16:41.793
I shouldn't have invited you!

16:41.876 --> 16:42.877
I thought you actually wanted

16:42.961 --> 16:43.878
-to do this!
-Oh, boy.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.672
-Tina, you're screaming.
-It's loud.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.382
Yeah, Tina.
We're in a theater.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.175
I'm such an idiot for thinking

16:49.259 --> 16:50.677
we could do something interesting together

16:50.760 --> 16:53.013
and remember it and bond over it
and be a krew, with a K!

16:53.096 --> 16:54.681
Dominic, can you stop the movie?

16:54.764 --> 16:57.100
Hey, uh, ma'am-teen-person?

16:57.183 --> 16:58.685
You're-you're kind of freaking out

16:58.768 --> 17:00.562
and ruining the movie for everyone.
Are you okay?

17:00.645 --> 17:02.856
No.
In the game of okay or not okay,

17:02.939 --> 17:05.316
I am not okay!
Aah!

17:05.400 --> 17:06.985
-(crying loudly)
-Tina, wait...

17:07.068 --> 17:07.986
-Ow.
-Sorry.

17:08.069 --> 17:08.987
-ZEKE: Ow.
-Sorry.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.281
-Ow.
-Ow.
-Sorry. Sorry.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.951
<i>TINA:</i>
<i>Ugh!</i>

17:15.035 --> 17:16.286
Why did I invite them?

17:16.369 --> 17:17.912
Tina, you were just trying

17:17.996 --> 17:19.289
to share something
that you thought was cool,

17:19.372 --> 17:21.708
like I was trying to do with you.

17:21.791 --> 17:22.876
Which they ruined.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.210
Yeah.
They really did.

17:24.294 --> 17:25.712
-They're awful.
-Yeah.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.547
And now they're in there
watching the movie

17:27.630 --> 17:29.215
they don't care about at all
and we're out here.

17:29.299 --> 17:31.593
Yeah.
That's not how I saw things going.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.053
Can we just go home without them?

17:33.136 --> 17:35.138
I-I don't think
I'm allowed to do that, Tina.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.723
Even though it would be pretty fun

17:36.806 --> 17:38.558
-just to leave them here.
-It really would.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.185
Do you want me to go get them
and we can leave?

17:40.268 --> 17:41.978
I understand if you don't
want to go back in there.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.147
'Cause of the whole screaming
really loud at everyone thing?

17:44.230 --> 17:46.524
-Yeah.
-Can we just sit here for a little bit?

17:46.608 --> 17:48.109
Of course.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.946
They're gonna rip each other apart!

17:52.030 --> 17:53.907
Stop it!
Stop fighting!

17:53.990 --> 17:55.325
God, they're out of control!

17:55.408 --> 17:56.576
What if we feed them more?

17:56.659 --> 17:57.786
Gene, empty your pockets.

17:57.869 --> 17:59.162
I know you got something in there.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.955
My pocket pantry is empty at this hour.

18:01.039 --> 18:02.332
I refill it in the morning.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.376
I just wanted to give them something nice.

18:04.459 --> 18:05.835
Something special.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.253
Mom, where are the matches?

18:07.337 --> 18:09.047
I feel like we can solve the problem
with burning things.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.007
What?
How would that even work?

18:11.091 --> 18:12.425
We light the restaurant on fire,

18:12.509 --> 18:13.802
then the raccoons make peace

18:13.885 --> 18:15.011
and unite to help us put it out?

18:15.095 --> 18:16.846
No.
All right, I know what we need to do.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.099
-What?
-Your dad's not gonna like it.

18:19.182 --> 18:20.684
And it's gonna make a big mess.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.477
And we're gonna have to clean it
up before he gets home.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.728
But it's our only option.

18:23.812 --> 18:24.854
Are you gonna go pee-pee in the alley

18:24.938 --> 18:25.980
to show your dominance?

18:26.064 --> 18:27.565
No. Doesn't work. I've tried it.

18:27.649 --> 18:29.234
I'm opening the dumpster.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.860
I think the raccoon restaurant

18:30.944 --> 18:32.821
was something I did just to make me happy.

18:32.904 --> 18:34.948
What's in here... that'll make them happy.

18:35.031 --> 18:37.033
It's like an all-you-can-eat
raccoon buffet.

18:37.117 --> 18:40.036
All right, dumpster's open, raccoons.
Have at it!

18:40.120 --> 18:41.329
They went in.

18:41.413 --> 18:42.997
The smell lets you know
your plan is working.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.541
Yeah.
It's gonna be bad.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.751
I got to say, it was
a pretty good opening night.

18:46.835 --> 18:48.878
I have a few notes for tomorrow.

18:48.962 --> 18:51.923
You know, the first time
I came to <i>Vampire Disco Death Dance,</i>

18:52.007 --> 18:54.384
-I came by myself.
-Really? You came alone?

18:54.467 --> 18:56.720
I didn't think anybody
I was hanging out with would like it.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.638
But I remember sitting there,

18:58.722 --> 19:00.974
looking around the theater
at all these people in costume,

19:01.057 --> 19:02.684
all of us singing together,

19:02.767 --> 19:05.729
and I thought, "Wow, I'm-I'm not alone.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.773
"I'm with people who,
you know, kind of get me.

19:08.857 --> 19:10.025
Th-They exist."

19:10.108 --> 19:11.776
So you found them?
People that got you?

19:11.860 --> 19:13.028
Yeah. Eventually.

19:13.111 --> 19:14.195
You know... some.

19:14.279 --> 19:15.697
Basically, your mother.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.615
Anyone else?
People you keep in touch with?

19:17.699 --> 19:19.492
Groups of old friends
you go on adventures with?

19:19.576 --> 19:22.203
(chuckles)
Oh. Oh, no, I-I don't do that.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.497
I mean, I just kind of go to bed.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.207
But Tina, you'll meet people like that.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.542
Y-You'll go on adventures.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.878
You'll stay in touch.
I know you will.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.588
-You really think so?
-I know it,

19:31.671 --> 19:33.381
because I would want
to be one of those people

19:33.465 --> 19:35.175
-if I met you.
-Thanks, Dad.

19:35.258 --> 19:36.468
-(disco playing in distance)
-Oh, this is the last song.

19:36.551 --> 19:37.844
Tina, come on.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.929
There's a little dance
everybody does to this one.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.389
I'm not a very good dancer.

19:41.473 --> 19:43.391
I mean, you're moving.

19:43.475 --> 19:46.561
Okay, so this is where Destiny
turns Kevin into a vampire

19:46.644 --> 19:48.271
so that they can be together forever.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.522
Aw, that's nice.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.191
Yeah.
I mean, all the vampires

19:51.274 --> 19:52.400
kind of take turns drinking from him.

19:52.484 --> 19:53.777
But there's-there's no blood.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.779
It's just a lot of licking.
Ton of licking.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.072
What's the song called?

19:57.155 --> 19:58.740
Uh, "Shake Your Love Parts."

19:58.823 --> 20:00.283
The verses are really sweet.

20:00.367 --> 20:03.078
The chorus is definitely a...
you know, a little... adult.

20:03.161 --> 20:04.996
Uh, and that's the dance to it?

20:05.080 --> 20:06.623
Kind of.
I-I think.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.250
You know, my body doesn't
go in all the directions anymore.

20:09.334 --> 20:10.960
Thanks for taking me here, Dad.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.962
I guess I'll just have to wait
to meet whoever I meet next.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.839
And in the meantime,
you have a group of kids

20:14.923 --> 20:17.842
who maybe aren't terrible all the time?

20:17.926 --> 20:19.260
Mm...
Let's just dance.

20:19.344 --> 20:21.179
Or do whatever it is
you're doing right now.

20:22.430 --> 20:25.350
So, um, how did you kids like the movie

20:25.433 --> 20:27.852
that I wanted my daughter and I to go to?

20:27.936 --> 20:29.813
There were actually some
pretty cool dance moves in it.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.564
Their outfits were kind of dumb, though.

20:31.648 --> 20:33.358
Yeah, their pants
got really big at the bottom

20:33.441 --> 20:35.068
and I didn't know why.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.654
And then all these bats started
flyin' at this guy's face

20:37.737 --> 20:38.905
and I was like, "What the ass?"

20:38.988 --> 20:40.657
And then the bats carried a disco ball

20:40.740 --> 20:42.117
around the whole city.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.411
It was actually kind of beautiful.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.496
Really?
So you guys didn't hate it?

20:46.579 --> 20:48.540
Yeah, it wasn't totally dumb.

20:48.623 --> 20:50.000
Just, like, mostly stupid.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.002
Just like you, Tammy.
Just joking.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.087
Like how our crew does?
Sometimes?

20:54.170 --> 20:55.463
-Kid Crew.
-Oh, my God,

20:55.547 --> 20:56.840
let's yell at those people in that car!

20:56.923 --> 20:57.924
BOB:
No, please don't.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.300
Your car is blue!

20:59.384 --> 21:00.844
Drive, drive, drive, drive!

21:33.960 --> 21:35.920
