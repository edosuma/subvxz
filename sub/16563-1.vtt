01:06.404 --> 01:08.416
Now, listen, I'm all in on Ginny Baker.

01:08.440 --> 01:10.706
I think it's the biggest
sports story since O.J.,

01:10.741 --> 01:12.475
and hopefully has a happier ending,

01:12.510 --> 01:15.343
but comparing this girl to
Jackie Robinson is preposterous.

01:26.656 --> 01:28.623
We're going another way.

01:28.658 --> 01:31.658
If you want to say she's
only getting her shot

01:31.694 --> 01:34.328
because she's a woman,
go ahead, but let's be real.

01:34.363 --> 01:36.330
If you're saying that, you're a man.

01:36.365 --> 01:39.533
You're a backwards-thinking,
backwards-cap-wearing,

01:39.569 --> 01:41.435
male-pattern-baldness-hiding man.

01:41.471 --> 01:44.105
So, bitch and moan all you want,
gentlemen, but tonight,

01:44.140 --> 01:46.640
a girl's gonna be the lead
sports story in the world.

01:46.675 --> 01:48.708
And if that upsets you, well,

01:48.743 --> 01:50.276
maybe you're just getting your period.

01:50.312 --> 01:51.611
Go get 'em, Ginny!

01:51.646 --> 01:53.146
Sorry.

01:53.181 --> 01:54.747
Go, girl!

02:01.305 --> 02:03.402
Well, unless you've been

02:03.425 --> 02:05.491
under a rock for the past 48 hours,

02:05.526 --> 02:07.692
you know that the San Diego Padres

02:07.728 --> 02:10.294
have called up
Ginny Baker to start today

02:10.330 --> 02:12.164
against the Los Angeles Dodgers.

02:12.199 --> 02:15.167
Baker becomes the first female athlete

02:15.202 --> 02:17.236
to compete in any of the four major

02:17.271 --> 02:19.738
North American
professional sports leagues.

02:19.773 --> 02:23.674
This after a five-year journey
through the Padres system,

02:23.709 --> 02:25.843
and it marks a day
that many, quite frankly,

02:25.878 --> 02:27.512
doubted would ever come.

02:27.547 --> 02:29.480
This is clearly a momentous occasion

02:29.516 --> 02:30.848
in the history of the sport.

02:30.883 --> 02:32.856
For those of you
that may have been alive

02:32.857 --> 02:34.553
when Jackie Robinson made his debut,

02:34.587 --> 02:36.287
this may take you back to that.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.622
But for the rest of us,

02:37.657 --> 02:39.819
- it really illustrates...
- You're like Elvis.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.126
You're like Elvis.

02:44.630 --> 02:46.329
I'm El... uh, I'm Eliot.

02:46.365 --> 02:48.598
I work with Amelia. She
thought I could help manage

02:48.634 --> 02:50.811
your social media accounts,
maybe get you set up on Insta...

02:50.835 --> 02:52.802
This is a story
that should inspire both...

02:52.837 --> 02:55.304
Game day. Don't take it personal.

02:55.339 --> 02:58.574
Hey, Joe? It's Joe, right?

02:58.609 --> 02:59.653
- Yes, ma'am.
- Who's the most

02:59.677 --> 03:01.214
important person you've ever driven?

03:01.215 --> 03:03.005
Well, back in the
early '90s, I once drove...

03:03.006 --> 03:04.079
Wrong answer, Joe.

03:04.114 --> 03:06.282
The most important person
you've ever driven

03:06.317 --> 03:08.357
is the 23-year-old
sitting right next to me.

03:08.358 --> 03:10.764
It's just a two-minute drive
to the stadium. Please stop

03:10.788 --> 03:13.254
at stop signs and watch
your blind spots.

03:13.290 --> 03:14.556
We screw up nothing today.

03:14.591 --> 03:15.690
Copy that.

03:15.725 --> 03:18.426
Who'd you drive, early '90s?

03:18.461 --> 03:20.361
Michael Jackson.

03:20.397 --> 03:22.063
Very cool.

03:22.098 --> 03:24.566
He even said he liked
my tie. Well, actually, he...

03:24.817 --> 03:26.668
- Okay, Joe, that's enough.
- But what do we know

03:26.692 --> 03:28.225
about Ginny Baker as an actual,

03:28.260 --> 03:29.759
you know, Major League pitcher?

03:29.794 --> 03:32.629
Well, she's no power arm, Matt.

03:32.664 --> 03:35.098
She tops out in the high 80s,
which has gotten a lot

03:35.133 --> 03:37.934
of attention, but it's still
low by Major League standards.

03:37.969 --> 03:40.503
She does have an arsenal
of pitches, though,

03:40.538 --> 03:42.605
including that nasty screwball.

03:43.975 --> 03:46.575
Hey.

03:46.611 --> 03:48.176
You know the drill, G.

03:48.211 --> 03:50.779
Nothing you haven't seen
before. Maybe just on

03:50.814 --> 03:52.681
a slightly bigger scale.

03:57.336 --> 03:59.603
Oh, my God.

04:11.749 --> 04:14.149
Are you ready for this?

04:18.723 --> 04:21.690
I've been ready my whole life.

04:21.923 --> 04:24.080
_

04:27.297 --> 04:29.698
Right. No, back up a little.

04:29.733 --> 04:32.133
Open your legs. Open your legs.

04:32.168 --> 04:33.768
Yeah, that's right. Bend your knees.

04:33.804 --> 04:35.644
Okay, you ready? Here comes
the high, hard one.

04:35.672 --> 04:37.604
Here we go.

04:39.342 --> 04:41.642
What...? What you doing, boy?

04:41.677 --> 04:42.921
For God's sake, get back in there.

04:42.945 --> 04:44.678
- No way.
- Willie!

04:44.714 --> 04:46.246
Bill, he doesn't want to play.

04:46.281 --> 04:48.549
I'm trying to raise a
ballplayer here, Janet.

04:48.584 --> 04:49.916
Leave him alone.

04:56.791 --> 04:59.625
That's right,
little girl. That's a ball.

04:59.661 --> 05:01.461
Throw it to Papa.

05:01.496 --> 05:02.862
Throw it, just like this.

05:02.897 --> 05:04.464
Real hard, right here.

05:09.270 --> 05:11.636
I'll be damned.

05:16.176 --> 05:17.342
There she is!

05:17.378 --> 05:19.711
Ginny!

05:21.348 --> 05:22.313
- Ginny, hi.
- Hi.

05:22.349 --> 05:23.648
Oscar Arguella, Padres GM.

05:23.684 --> 05:25.007
Stay with me.

05:25.256 --> 05:27.129
Fans started lining up the moment
the call-up was announced.

05:27.153 --> 05:29.253
Web site crashed within minutes.

05:29.288 --> 05:31.355
Our nerds had no idea what hit them.

05:31.391 --> 05:33.123
Hell of a thing
you're doing, young lady.

05:33.158 --> 05:34.458
You nervous?

05:34.494 --> 05:36.560
No, not really. Makes one of us.

05:36.596 --> 05:38.396
Come on, boss is waiting for you.

05:38.431 --> 05:40.831
Ginny, welcome.

05:40.867 --> 05:42.165
Hope the trip in was okay.

05:42.201 --> 05:43.834
I was going to send my plane,

05:43.870 --> 05:46.135
but Oscar tells me that

05:46.170 --> 05:47.766
you like to be treated regularly,

05:47.767 --> 05:49.617
and while my plane is most certainly

05:49.641 --> 05:51.307
cool as hell,

05:51.342 --> 05:52.776
regular it is not.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.688
Walk with me.

05:56.715 --> 05:58.815
Your teammates are excited to meet you.

05:58.850 --> 06:00.182
No, they're not.

06:00.183 --> 06:02.629
Ticketing and sales
people, they're excited to meet me.

06:02.653 --> 06:05.721
My teammates, 75% think
I'm the next San Diego Chicken.

06:05.756 --> 06:07.856
The other 25% just want
to see me shower.

06:07.892 --> 06:10.327
And I bet your manager thinks
you should've called up Walker

06:10.328 --> 06:11.159
instead of me.

06:11.194 --> 06:12.406
I'm just here because of all that.

06:12.430 --> 06:14.296
But none of that matters, you know why?

06:14.331 --> 06:16.234
No, but color me intrigued.

06:16.378 --> 06:17.778
Because today, I'm the starting pitcher

06:17.802 --> 06:20.334
for the San Diego Padres.

06:20.369 --> 06:21.769
Well,

06:21.805 --> 06:23.805
damn it, Oscar, you see that?

06:23.840 --> 06:26.407
You should've let me send her the plane.

06:26.443 --> 06:28.709
She's on her way down.

06:28.745 --> 06:32.713
Look, we can lie to the
reporters all we want,

06:32.749 --> 06:34.849
but obviously this is a distraction.

06:34.884 --> 06:36.683
There's no way around it.

06:36.718 --> 06:39.519
I had to buy tickets for my
freakin' mother-in-law today.

06:39.555 --> 06:41.688
Oh, that reminds me,

06:41.723 --> 06:44.123
if you see her in the
stands, please say hi.

06:44.159 --> 06:46.326
She's the one with the face
that looks like Shrek.

06:46.361 --> 06:49.158
No offense, Shrek.

06:50.012 --> 06:52.566
It's 2016, gentlemen.

06:52.601 --> 06:54.132
So let's be gentlemen.

06:54.168 --> 06:56.168
Let's be professional. Remember,

06:56.203 --> 06:58.491
this is a spot starter
called up from Triple A

06:58.492 --> 07:00.205
to start a game for us.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.140
We're gonna treat her
like any other player.

07:02.176 --> 07:03.676
No special treatment.

07:03.711 --> 07:06.645
Knock, knock.

07:06.681 --> 07:08.581
Oh, crap.

07:11.618 --> 07:13.284
Ginny Baker.

07:16.155 --> 07:18.490
Get your big old bubble butt over here

07:18.525 --> 07:21.493
- and give me a hug!
- Blip!

07:23.763 --> 07:25.763
I came up through the
system with this girl.

07:25.799 --> 07:28.726
We did almost a full season
together in San Antonio.

07:28.853 --> 07:30.211
What was that, like,
three years back now?

07:30.235 --> 07:31.602
Yeah, that's right.

07:31.637 --> 07:33.801
Until you got promoted,
became an All-Star,

07:33.802 --> 07:35.238
and permanently abandoned my ass.

07:35.273 --> 07:37.774
You know, as much as I loved
living off of ramen noodles,

07:37.810 --> 07:39.175
the wife had other plans.

07:39.211 --> 07:40.744
I bet she did.

07:40.779 --> 07:43.365
She spends everything, Ginny.

07:45.216 --> 07:47.483
So where they setting you up?

07:47.519 --> 07:50.720
This is the clubhouse attendance room,

07:50.755 --> 07:53.789
but at least it has a door.

07:53.825 --> 07:56.592
This is not gonna be
permanent, I'm telling you that right now.

07:56.628 --> 07:59.639
Sorry, who is this complete
stranger in my clubhouse

07:59.640 --> 08:01.092
pretending to be my boss?

08:01.216 --> 08:02.463
We still haven't met,

08:02.499 --> 08:05.344
probably because I don't represent
lifetime 500 managers

08:05.345 --> 08:06.271
with man boobs.

08:06.272 --> 08:07.376
Oscar?

08:07.456 --> 08:08.269
- Amelia.
- Al.

08:08.304 --> 08:09.671
Everyone.

08:09.706 --> 08:11.510
This is fine, Skip.

08:11.626 --> 08:14.424
I didn't see Mike Lawson back in there.

08:14.448 --> 08:16.114
He likes to make a grand entrance.

08:16.149 --> 08:17.175
Total diva.

08:17.317 --> 08:19.261
I'd kill him, but he has
this annoying habit

08:19.285 --> 08:21.118
of driving in 130 runs a year.

08:21.153 --> 08:23.186
Why don't you check out what's in there?

08:29.328 --> 08:31.094
Forty-three?

08:32.331 --> 08:34.465
One up from Jackie.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.566
We thought it was fitting.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.289
Ginny, Ginny.

09:00.324 --> 09:01.856
How does this differ from Triple A?

09:01.892 --> 09:03.946
One or two more of you, maybe.

09:04.083 --> 09:06.172
This was supposed to be
a photo op, not a presser.

09:06.196 --> 09:07.974
- She'll be fine.
- I know she'll be fine, Oscar.

09:07.998 --> 09:10.009
I've been watching her
navigate this crap for a year.

09:10.033 --> 09:11.310
Frank, you must be pleased

09:11.334 --> 09:12.878
that Ginny's start is sold out tonight.

09:12.902 --> 09:14.802
I'm ending this.

09:14.837 --> 09:15.987
Amelia, relax.

09:16.114 --> 09:18.183
She's not Nolan Ryan,
she's a number five starter

09:18.207 --> 09:19.885
being called up for a spot start.

09:19.909 --> 09:21.842
She's the number five
starter that's been offered

09:21.877 --> 09:23.255
the cover of Time, Sports
Illustrated, and Maxim

09:23.279 --> 09:24.978
in the same week.

09:25.014 --> 09:27.181
I mean, you do realize what
you have, Oscar, don't you?

09:27.216 --> 09:29.182
Because I do. I put my entire

09:29.217 --> 09:30.828
client list on hold
to represent a pitcher

09:30.852 --> 09:33.252
and I'd never even been
to a baseball game.

09:33.288 --> 09:35.422
I'm gonna lose Clooney and I don't care.

09:35.457 --> 09:37.116
He invites me to Lake Como.

09:37.241 --> 09:39.804
And I'm giving that up instantly
and without hesitation.

09:39.828 --> 09:42.094
Because this girl is Hillary
Clinton with sex appeal.

09:42.130 --> 09:43.963
She is a Kardashian with a skill set.

09:43.998 --> 09:46.343
She's the most important woman
on the planet right now, Oscar,

09:46.367 --> 09:47.966
and from here on out,

09:48.001 --> 09:50.101
everything goes through me.

09:50.137 --> 09:51.804
Am I being clear?

09:51.839 --> 09:54.340
What's Clooney's place in Como like?

09:54.375 --> 09:58.410
It's exactly like San
Diego, but a million times better.

09:59.980 --> 10:01.146
From here on out.

10:01.181 --> 10:03.214
You'll be in the loop.

10:03.249 --> 10:05.383
- Thank you.
- Dinner?

10:05.418 --> 10:07.385
Never. I'm pulling her.

10:11.391 --> 10:12.990
You have no chance.

10:13.025 --> 10:15.593
I've seen her make movie
stars cry, won't say who.

10:16.863 --> 10:19.162
Gerard Butler.

10:19.197 --> 10:20.997
Last question.

10:36.687 --> 10:38.947
Look what we got here.

10:38.983 --> 10:40.544
Ginny Baker in the flesh.

10:40.655 --> 10:42.596
I've been answering
questions about you forever,

10:42.620 --> 10:43.997
and that is not easy for me, you know,

10:44.021 --> 10:45.388
talking about other people.

10:45.423 --> 10:47.857
They tell me I'm a narcissist.

10:47.892 --> 10:50.753
I should tell you, I
have your rookie card.

10:50.845 --> 10:52.905
- You've been my favorite player
since I was... - Yeah, don't.

10:52.929 --> 10:54.896
Makes you look stupid,
makes me feel old.

10:54.931 --> 10:56.642
Would it be
inappropriate to say that you might be

10:56.666 --> 10:59.033
the second prettiest
teammate I've ever had?

10:59.068 --> 11:00.234
It would.

11:00.270 --> 11:01.503
What? Second prettiest?

11:01.538 --> 11:04.138
Yeah, I was in this charity
softball game with DiCaprio.

11:04.173 --> 11:05.373
Beautiful eyes.

11:05.409 --> 11:07.876
Anyway, glad you're here.
We could use you.

11:07.911 --> 11:10.277
Mind if we go over the hitters
in the trainers' room?

11:10.312 --> 11:11.445
Fine by me.

11:12.214 --> 11:13.213
Oh!

11:13.248 --> 11:15.115
Hey.

11:17.352 --> 11:19.553
Think that's funny?

11:19.588 --> 11:21.522
Think you're the first
teammate to slap my ass

11:21.557 --> 11:23.590
- to get a laugh from his friends?
- No.

11:23.626 --> 11:25.370
I played two years
Winterball, five years in the minors.

11:25.394 --> 11:28.131
I've done stints in hellholes you haven't
seen in a decade, superstar.

11:28.132 --> 11:29.995
Want to put on a show for your friends?

11:30.031 --> 11:32.031
Find another scene partner,
I'm here to pitch.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.132
Any questions?

11:34.402 --> 11:36.536
Hey. Hey!

11:37.872 --> 11:41.140
I slap asses. It's my thing.

11:41.175 --> 11:42.475
I slap Zimmerman's pimply ass,

11:42.510 --> 11:44.640
I slap Roger's hairy ass,

11:44.641 --> 11:47.412
and as long as you're on this
team, I will be slapping your

11:47.448 --> 11:49.514
perfect, pear-shaped ass.

11:49.550 --> 11:52.150
I am an ass-slapper, rookie.

11:52.185 --> 11:53.852
I'm also the captain of this team.

11:53.887 --> 11:56.087
So from here on out,
every time I slap your ass,

11:56.122 --> 11:57.622
you just say, "Thank you, sir.

11:57.658 --> 12:00.391
May I have another?" and take the mound.

12:00.427 --> 12:01.525
Do you have any questions?

12:01.561 --> 12:05.062
Young DiCaprio or old DiCaprio?

12:05.097 --> 12:07.064
- I'm sorry?
- The charity game.

12:07.099 --> 12:09.166
Young Leo, fine. He's probably
prettier than me.

12:09.201 --> 12:10.868
But old Leo looks like a fish.

12:10.903 --> 12:12.102
Well, that was...

12:12.137 --> 12:14.204
it was a while ago. He was young.

12:14.239 --> 12:17.941
Then I think we're on
the same page, Captain.

12:23.615 --> 12:26.048
This is gonna be fun.

12:29.315 --> 12:31.914
The one guy, whew, he was ugly.

12:31.950 --> 12:35.418
Woofie. He should've got a medal
just for leaving the house,

12:35.454 --> 12:36.864
- he was so ugly.
- No, you're really...

12:36.888 --> 12:39.488
Come on, like one of those President's
Medals for bravery.

12:40.459 --> 12:41.824
So...

12:41.860 --> 12:43.326
How you doing?

12:43.362 --> 12:45.227
You know.

12:45.263 --> 12:47.374
First time in the majors
and all... same for everyone.

12:47.398 --> 12:49.298
Ginny! Ginny!

12:49.333 --> 12:50.766
Ginny! Ginny!

12:50.801 --> 12:52.734
- Ginny! Ginny!
- Hey.

12:52.770 --> 12:54.936
I got you.

12:56.340 --> 12:57.406
Thank you.

12:57.441 --> 12:58.674
So, come on.

12:58.709 --> 13:00.643
There's somebody that wants to see you.

13:02.546 --> 13:04.579
- I... Look at you!
- Over here.

13:04.614 --> 13:05.680
Oh, my God!

13:05.715 --> 13:07.482
- Girl!
- Look at me? Look at them!

13:07.517 --> 13:09.728
- They're huge!
- They're special is what they are.

13:09.752 --> 13:10.867
Boys,

13:10.869 --> 13:12.665
tell Ginny what your favorite food is.

13:12.689 --> 13:13.788
- Sushi!
- Sushi!

13:13.823 --> 13:14.922
Sushi, Ginny.

13:14.957 --> 13:16.457
Little black boys eating sushi.

13:16.493 --> 13:17.458
Oh, be quiet.

13:17.494 --> 13:18.659
Sign my ball! Ginny! Ginny!

13:18.694 --> 13:20.694
My ball, Ginny! Sign my ball!

13:20.729 --> 13:22.729
Ginny, Ginny!

13:22.764 --> 13:23.930
How y'all doing?

13:23.965 --> 13:26.266
I'm gonna be in the majors someday, too.

13:26.302 --> 13:28.602
Well, hurry on up then, and
maybe we can be teammates.

13:30.382 --> 13:31.677
_

13:32.211 --> 13:33.937
_

13:33.938 --> 13:36.594
_

13:52.593 --> 13:54.426
How long has she been down there?

13:54.461 --> 13:56.661
You don't think she actually
sticks, do you?

13:57.698 --> 13:59.897
She's just here to sell tickets.

13:59.933 --> 14:01.600
Second I come back, she's gone.

14:03.036 --> 14:04.836
What's your take, Mikey?

14:04.871 --> 14:07.872
I watched some tape on her
last night, I was surprised.

14:07.907 --> 14:11.442
Got more zip than Tommy,
that's for sure.

14:11.477 --> 14:13.844
Look at his face.

14:13.879 --> 14:15.646
Look at his face!

14:16.915 --> 14:18.604
Come on, she's a gimmick.

14:18.739 --> 14:20.696
She's the dwarf who played
for the St. Louis Browns,

14:20.720 --> 14:21.918
right?

14:21.954 --> 14:23.420
She's gonna last a game, maybe two.

14:23.456 --> 14:25.296
And then she's gonna
be a nice little asterisk,

14:25.324 --> 14:27.457
and we'll have a great story
to tell our grandkids.

14:36.402 --> 14:38.011
Folks, you are looking

14:38.035 --> 14:39.469
at a moment in history.

14:39.504 --> 14:42.053
23-year-old Ginny
Baker is warming up

14:42.054 --> 14:43.483
in the San Diego Padres' bullpen

14:43.507 --> 14:46.441
in preparation for her first start

14:46.477 --> 14:47.509
in the Major Leagues.

14:47.544 --> 14:48.610
Welcome, everybody,

14:48.646 --> 14:49.711
and hi to my daughters,

14:49.747 --> 14:51.546
who are actually watching their dad

14:51.582 --> 14:53.515
with great interest for this game.

14:53.550 --> 14:55.450
All right, let me get in there.

14:58.322 --> 15:01.289
Now, let's see this screwgie everybody's
been talking about.

15:01.324 --> 15:02.768
Well, I don't think it's possible

15:02.792 --> 15:05.326
to measure the impact
this young woman could have

15:05.361 --> 15:07.005
- on the game of baseball, Joe.
- I agree with you.

15:07.029 --> 15:09.007
Just to give you a little
context for what's happening

15:09.031 --> 15:10.576
here, when Ginny's start was announced,

15:10.600 --> 15:12.787
the Padres quickly sold out,

15:12.789 --> 15:14.302
- and this afternoon...
- Not bad.

15:14.303 --> 15:17.370
...there'll be an
estimated 43,000 in the ballpark.

15:17.406 --> 15:18.805
Last one.

15:56.676 --> 15:57.875
Go to third!

16:04.842 --> 16:07.420
- My kid wants a tryout.
- Really?

16:07.421 --> 16:08.457
We're kind of in the
middle of something...

16:08.460 --> 16:10.354
- Just let her throw a few.
- Really?

16:10.389 --> 16:13.122
Let her throw a few.

16:13.158 --> 16:15.959
Okay, man, go ahead.

16:15.994 --> 16:17.394
Trying a new pitcher.

16:41.886 --> 16:43.084
You okay?

16:44.954 --> 16:47.455
We did it, Pop!

16:47.491 --> 16:49.491
We ain't done nothin' yet.

16:58.835 --> 17:00.868
Peaches?

17:00.903 --> 17:04.938
Nectarines.

17:04.973 --> 17:07.674
You're never gonna have the
arm to get you to the majors.

17:07.710 --> 17:09.272
You'll never get further than I did,

17:09.298 --> 17:10.944
- minors at best.
- But...

17:10.979 --> 17:14.681
A girl will never be able
to throw hard enough

17:14.717 --> 17:16.816
to compete with boys,
not as they start growing.

17:16.851 --> 17:18.917
It's biology and we can't change that.

17:21.122 --> 17:23.589
That's why we need a secret weapon.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.694
End of my career, this old
Latin guy showed me a pitch.

17:28.730 --> 17:31.464
Was too late for me, but
you're gonna learn it now.

17:31.499 --> 17:33.565
You're gonna master it, little girl,

17:33.600 --> 17:36.635
and you're gonna ride it
straight to the majors.

17:36.670 --> 17:38.136
What is it?

17:38.171 --> 17:41.205
It's called a screwball.

17:41.241 --> 17:45.644
Now, you form a circle with
your thumb and your forefinger

17:45.679 --> 17:48.146
like this and then you spread
your remaining fingers

17:48.181 --> 17:49.548
around the ball.

17:49.583 --> 17:52.817
Now, the key is, when you throw it,

17:52.852 --> 17:55.820
you don't exert any pressure
from these two fingers, okay?

17:55.855 --> 17:58.221
I don't want to see
any dents in the nectarine

17:58.257 --> 17:59.757
from these fingers.

17:59.792 --> 18:02.493
When you can throw 100 proper,

18:02.528 --> 18:05.496
then we'll try it with a real ball.

18:23.682 --> 18:24.980
And there you have it.

18:25.015 --> 18:26.582
For the first time in history,

18:26.617 --> 18:28.517
a woman has taken the mound

18:28.552 --> 18:30.586
in a Major League Baseball game.

18:36.226 --> 18:37.626
Let's go, Ginny!

18:47.396 --> 18:50.863
This is one of those
moments in sports, John,

18:50.898 --> 18:53.432
where you'll remember
where you were when you saw it.

18:53.468 --> 18:56.335
Alex McCutchen will lead off.

18:56.370 --> 18:59.203
And we are ready to go.

19:05.846 --> 19:07.612
Whoa!

19:07.647 --> 19:09.280
That's all the way to the backstop.

19:09.315 --> 19:12.851
Well, we got that out
of our system, huh?

19:22.561 --> 19:24.670
Here's the wind and the pitch.

19:24.816 --> 19:27.327
- High again.
- She's got the adrenaline going.

19:27.328 --> 19:28.365
She needs to settle down.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.467
Here's the 2-0 pitch.

19:30.874 --> 19:34.336
This one's in the dirt.

19:34.372 --> 19:37.573
Want me to go talk to her?

19:37.609 --> 19:39.308
Let's see what she does.

19:45.817 --> 19:49.183
So Ginny Baker has
walked the leadoff hitter

19:49.219 --> 19:50.785
on four pitches, and none of them

19:50.821 --> 19:52.387
were particularly close.

19:52.422 --> 19:53.889
Lawson's heading out

19:53.924 --> 19:55.390
to the mound.

19:55.425 --> 19:56.625
Come on, take a breath.

19:56.660 --> 19:58.627
- Give me the ball.
- Take a minute.

19:58.662 --> 19:59.861
Give me the damn ball.

20:05.267 --> 20:06.507
Come on, Ginny, let 'em hit it.

20:11.340 --> 20:12.873
The runner goes.

20:12.909 --> 20:14.775
Baker delivers.

20:14.810 --> 20:18.311
Oh, boy, the runner advances
to third on the wild pitch,

20:18.347 --> 20:19.780
and this...

20:19.815 --> 20:21.314
there's no other way around it,

20:21.350 --> 20:23.349
this is getting really
uncomfortable, John,

20:23.384 --> 20:24.617
really, really quickly.

20:24.653 --> 20:25.852
Yeah, you know she's nervous.

20:34.863 --> 20:37.730
Ginny, Ginny, sign my
ball, sign my ball!

20:37.766 --> 20:41.199
Let's go, Padres, let's go!

20:41.234 --> 20:43.809
Let's go, Padres, let's go!

20:43.943 --> 20:47.145
She's the dwarf who played
for the St. Louis Browns.

20:55.422 --> 20:58.226
Comparing this girl
to Jackie Robinson...

20:58.250 --> 20:59.450
Ain't done nothin' yet.

21:07.359 --> 21:09.259
Ball three, in the dirt again.

21:09.295 --> 21:11.829
Ball four, she walked him.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.499
Another wild pitch, and the run scores!

21:16.534 --> 21:19.435
Wow, that is ten consecutive balls

21:19.471 --> 21:21.304
and three wild pitches.
Not a good start.

21:21.339 --> 21:23.439
Honestly, I don't know
if I can watch this.

21:24.710 --> 21:26.275
Get Zapata ready.

21:41.325 --> 21:42.491
Paint the corner.

21:42.526 --> 21:44.259
I'm cooked, Pop.

21:44.294 --> 21:46.928
- Mom says dinner.
- And I said, "Paint the corner."

21:54.938 --> 21:56.370
I can't throw another strike.

21:56.405 --> 21:58.606
- Yes, you can.
- I can't.

22:00.710 --> 22:01.909
Willie, come here.

22:08.684 --> 22:11.317
- You want to help me help your sister?
- Yeah.

22:12.755 --> 22:14.688
Dad!

22:15.924 --> 22:18.358
Throw a strike.

22:28.970 --> 22:30.736
See?

22:30.772 --> 22:33.673
You can do it when you have to.

22:37.411 --> 22:40.344
All right, let's wash up for dinner.

22:40.380 --> 22:42.947
Come on, son. You're okay. I got

22:42.983 --> 22:46.951
some ice cream for dessert.
Mint chip like you like it.

22:55.995 --> 22:59.329
I don't... I don't know
what's happening. I just...

22:59.364 --> 23:02.052
I-I can't-can't get right. I just...

23:02.053 --> 23:04.793
Okay, okay. Calm down.
We've seen this a billion times.

23:07.006 --> 23:08.706
Get me out of the game.

23:08.741 --> 23:09.707
I'm sorry, what?

23:09.742 --> 23:11.041
Get me out.

23:15.613 --> 23:19.381
Oh, wow. That's gonna be all for Baker.

23:19.417 --> 23:23.485
- And this big crowd is stunned.
- Yeah, I feel for her.

23:23.521 --> 23:25.788
I can't even find the
words. How about "heartbreaking"?

23:25.824 --> 23:29.591
I think that's a word.
Just heartbreaking.

24:16.071 --> 24:18.171
Eliot, can I have a moment
with Ginny, please?

24:18.206 --> 24:20.172
Yeah.

24:20.207 --> 24:23.175
You know, I don't
even think that many people

24:23.210 --> 24:25.443
were watching this. Maybe.

24:25.479 --> 24:28.046
You know, it's just...

24:29.884 --> 24:32.050
Are they sending me down?

24:32.086 --> 24:34.686
No one has told me that.

24:38.792 --> 24:41.125
Ginny.

24:42.662 --> 24:44.495
Ginny, look at me.

24:47.767 --> 24:49.934
Today was a bad day.

24:49.969 --> 24:52.069
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.

24:53.906 --> 24:56.106
But all those little girls...

24:56.141 --> 24:58.508
The little girls need to find
someone else to count on.

24:59.812 --> 25:01.945
And you probably should, too.

25:27.479 --> 25:30.647
I can't do this right now, Pop.

25:30.682 --> 25:32.121
You have your glove?

25:32.122 --> 25:33.783
Please just leave me be.

25:33.819 --> 25:35.552
What the hell was that today?

25:35.587 --> 25:36.720
I don't know.

25:36.755 --> 25:37.854
What is your problem, girl?

25:37.890 --> 25:38.954
You are!

25:40.725 --> 25:42.758
I was just a little girl!

25:42.793 --> 25:44.760
I never asked for any of it!

25:44.795 --> 25:47.396
You chose it for me. You did.

25:47.431 --> 25:51.000
I have no friends, no interests!

25:51.035 --> 25:55.404
I'm a robot in cleats,
and I'm malfunctioning.

25:55.439 --> 25:58.506
It wasn't right what
you did. What you did to me.

26:01.878 --> 26:04.412
You done?

26:05.882 --> 26:07.549
Where's your glove?

26:07.584 --> 26:09.417
I'm tired, Pop.

26:09.452 --> 26:11.986
You threw ten pitches.
How tired can you be?

26:13.989 --> 26:16.523
I don't have my glove.

26:16.559 --> 26:19.392
Where is it?

26:22.932 --> 26:24.932
Again.

26:29.771 --> 26:31.971
Again.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.410
Again.

26:45.887 --> 26:47.385
Oscar.

26:48.922 --> 26:50.789
The door was open.

26:50.824 --> 26:52.824
No, it wasn't.

26:52.859 --> 26:54.759
No, it wasn't.

26:54.795 --> 26:58.897
Now, Oscar tells me that you
want to send Ginny back down.

26:58.932 --> 27:01.532
Oscar and I both agreed.

27:01.568 --> 27:02.867
Clearly she's not ready.

27:02.903 --> 27:05.402
Yeah, no, yesterday was a real disaster.

27:05.437 --> 27:07.938
It was, yes. She crushed
my bullpen. Those guys

27:07.974 --> 27:09.406
had to eat nine innings.

27:09.441 --> 27:10.786
Frank and I have been talking, Al.

27:10.810 --> 27:12.375
Have you, now?

27:12.411 --> 27:13.978
We can't send her down.

27:14.013 --> 27:17.681
You got to be kidding me. You're
laying down on this just to sell

27:17.717 --> 27:18.742
a few extra tickets?

27:18.767 --> 27:21.818
Now, it's more than a few
extra tickets, Al, and you know that.

27:21.853 --> 27:24.553
But that's not what this is
about, and you know that, too.

27:24.589 --> 27:27.690
It's one thing to be the team
that called up the first woman.

27:27.726 --> 27:30.359
It's another thing to be the
team that picked the wrong woman

27:30.394 --> 27:32.006
and turned this whole
thing into a disaster.

27:32.030 --> 27:33.997
- Oscar, it's my ball club!
- No, Al,

27:34.032 --> 27:36.966
it's mine. And I know this
because I bought it,

27:37.002 --> 27:39.801
and I kept the $700 million receipt.

27:41.605 --> 27:43.739
You're my manager,
and you're a good one.

27:43.774 --> 27:45.473
I have never overridden you before,

27:45.509 --> 27:49.077
and I hope never to have to do it again.

27:49.113 --> 27:54.415
But Baker starts again in five days.

28:00.876 --> 28:03.457
Don't worry. I got your back, Skip.

28:03.492 --> 28:05.726
Just give the kid
another start, all right?

28:05.762 --> 28:07.728
I'll handle all the politics.

28:09.165 --> 28:11.998
You just focus on being beautiful.

28:13.501 --> 28:14.868
You got to be kidding me.

28:14.903 --> 28:16.369
What is this, Bring Your Daughter

28:16.404 --> 28:18.371
- to Work Day?
- This you?

28:18.406 --> 28:20.006
Came from upstairs.

28:20.042 --> 28:21.607
This is a circus.

28:21.643 --> 28:23.476
I'm way too old to be
joining the circus.

28:23.511 --> 28:26.746
Yeah, you and me both.

28:26.782 --> 28:28.548
We can't win with her.

28:28.583 --> 28:31.650
Hey, Tommy, last I checked,
you were five and nine,

28:31.686 --> 28:34.553
- so we weren't exactly winning with you.
- Was I talking to you, Blip?

28:34.588 --> 28:36.933
- Hey, you know what, you don't have
to be talking to me... - Shut up. Hey!

28:36.957 --> 28:38.490
Hey!

28:50.904 --> 28:55.139
Okay, let's get back to work, everyone.

28:55.175 --> 28:57.474
Well, the decision is in.

28:57.510 --> 29:01.045
Ginny Baker will ride again,
which I guess just shows...

29:01.081 --> 29:02.779
I don't know. What
the hell does this show?

29:02.815 --> 29:04.681
That if you can't throw
the ball over the plate

29:04.717 --> 29:06.761
but you're really pretty, you
get to play in the big leagues?

29:06.785 --> 29:09.820
Mike, there have been reports
on some divided opinion

29:09.855 --> 29:12.133
- on Ginny Baker in the clubhouse...
- Guys, can we please

29:12.157 --> 29:13.957
find something else to talk about?

29:13.992 --> 29:15.570
What if I told you that
I've been secretly dating Adele

29:15.594 --> 29:17.034
and we're engaged? Would that do it?

29:17.062 --> 29:19.629
Because I am. Seriously.
Me, Adele, Rihanna.

29:19.664 --> 29:21.675
We bought an RV. We're living together.
We're gonna go on tour.

29:21.699 --> 29:24.499
Mike, will Ginny be ready
to pitch in three days?

29:24.535 --> 29:25.567
People want to know.

29:25.603 --> 29:26.680
Over here, Mike. Right here.

29:41.684 --> 29:43.551
Okay, so last week wasn't exactly

29:43.586 --> 29:45.064
the start we expected from Ginny Baker.

29:45.088 --> 29:47.055
I'm still driving
the bandwagon here, but...

29:47.090 --> 29:48.723
after that rough debut, let's hope

29:48.759 --> 29:49.724
it's a little better...

29:49.760 --> 29:50.959
Evelyn, I want to be alone.

29:50.994 --> 29:53.861
No, you don't.

29:53.896 --> 29:55.595
Are we ready to
double down on Ginny Baker?

29:55.631 --> 29:57.530
- Because I am...
- Oh, look at this.

29:57.566 --> 29:59.099
Not sure.

29:59.135 --> 30:00.234
This seems like

30:00.269 --> 30:01.802
a really good idea.

30:01.837 --> 30:02.803
Better yet,

30:02.838 --> 30:03.904
why don't you pound

30:03.939 --> 30:05.072
your face with a hammer?

30:05.107 --> 30:06.073
Give me the remote.

30:06.108 --> 30:07.241
Give!

30:07.276 --> 30:08.675
Gi... give it to me.

30:10.112 --> 30:11.144
Thank you.

30:13.782 --> 30:15.248
You think I haven't seen this?

30:15.283 --> 30:17.716
Hmm? You think I don't
deal with this every time

30:17.752 --> 30:19.518
Blip runs into an oh-for April?

30:19.553 --> 30:21.654
That's when I got to
get his head straight.

30:21.689 --> 30:22.789
Now...

30:22.824 --> 30:24.023
I can't do for you

30:24.058 --> 30:26.225
what I normally do for him.

30:26.261 --> 30:28.126
Haven't stretched enough for that,

30:28.162 --> 30:29.127
but I can...

30:29.163 --> 30:30.728
make Bloody Marys!

30:31.932 --> 30:33.598
- Evelyn.
- What?

30:33.633 --> 30:35.011
You should be home with your husband.

30:35.035 --> 30:36.701
He's having boys' night.

30:36.736 --> 30:37.969
With who?

30:41.308 --> 30:42.874
Why do you

30:42.910 --> 30:44.209
always drag me here?

30:44.244 --> 30:46.043
I like the food.

30:46.078 --> 30:48.545
- I'm sorry, can I just get one picture?
- Now don't be sorry.

30:48.580 --> 30:49.557
Get in here. It's happy hour.

30:49.581 --> 30:50.547
You can get two.

30:50.582 --> 30:51.615
Come on.

30:51.650 --> 30:53.117
Oh, I like sandwiches.

30:53.152 --> 30:54.185
There you go.

30:54.220 --> 30:55.252
Thank you.

30:55.288 --> 30:57.754
Yeah.

30:57.790 --> 30:59.523
I'll just be over here.

30:59.558 --> 31:00.724
She needs your help.

31:00.759 --> 31:01.969
I'm gonna be helping the hell out of her

31:01.993 --> 31:02.959
in about an hour.

31:02.994 --> 31:04.527
I'm not talking about her.

31:04.562 --> 31:06.796
I know who you're talking about.

31:08.566 --> 31:09.532
She walked.

31:09.567 --> 31:10.566
She quit.

31:10.601 --> 31:12.268
Yeah, but she's still here.

31:12.304 --> 31:14.137
She's a fighter.

31:14.172 --> 31:15.939
She's a fighter.

31:15.974 --> 31:18.741
I'm a national laughingstock, Evelyn.

31:18.776 --> 31:20.675
No, actually, check that.

31:20.711 --> 31:23.312
I'm the national laughingstock.

31:23.347 --> 31:24.813
Okay, we're done with this.

31:24.849 --> 31:26.014
Can we talk girl stuff now?

31:26.050 --> 31:27.582
Please? I just... I...

31:27.617 --> 31:28.984
I've always wondered...

31:29.019 --> 31:31.086
do you get to see them
naked in the locker room?

31:32.256 --> 31:33.688
Do you get to see the junk?

31:33.724 --> 31:36.057
You mean, like Mike Lawson's?

31:36.092 --> 31:38.625
Oh, half of San Diego's
seen Mike Lawson's.

31:40.263 --> 31:42.930
I know you want that ring.

31:42.966 --> 31:45.333
Think you need it for the legacy,

31:45.368 --> 31:47.601
and you're not seeing
the bigger picture.

31:47.636 --> 31:50.037
And what's that, black Yoda?

31:50.073 --> 31:53.206
This girl is your legacy.

31:53.242 --> 31:55.275
She's doing something that no one,

31:55.310 --> 31:56.276
I repeat...

31:56.311 --> 31:57.577
no one has ever

31:57.612 --> 31:59.712
done before and she needs help.

31:59.748 --> 32:02.048
Tomorrow night the entire world

32:02.084 --> 32:03.250
will be watching her.

32:03.285 --> 32:04.784
But as luck will have it,

32:04.819 --> 32:06.953
the best that I've ever seen

32:06.989 --> 32:10.756
will be 60 feet and six inches away.

32:10.791 --> 32:12.992
And...

32:13.027 --> 32:14.894
I don't know if he'll step up.

32:14.929 --> 32:17.696
But I'm hopeful.

32:17.731 --> 32:19.131
I'm hoping I'm going to be

32:19.166 --> 32:20.866
watching the nods, the gestures

32:20.902 --> 32:22.935
and the trips to the mound.

32:22.970 --> 32:27.038
Man... what a
beautiful thing that that would be.

32:30.428 --> 32:33.722
Well, in the words of
that great American poet,

32:33.746 --> 32:36.680
Yogi Berra: "It's like déjà
vu all over again."

32:36.716 --> 32:39.217
Tonight, the eyes of a
nation turn to San Diego

32:39.252 --> 32:41.685
once again, and I think I speak

32:41.721 --> 32:45.355
on behalf of everyone
when I say, I'm petrified.

32:45.391 --> 32:47.090
Hello again, everybody, I'm Joe Buck.

32:47.126 --> 32:48.725
And I'm John Smoltz.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.660
Tonight should be very interesting.

33:20.023 --> 33:23.891
State championship.

33:23.927 --> 33:25.427
We did it, Pop.

33:25.462 --> 33:27.162
We ain't done nothin' yet.

33:27.197 --> 33:29.164
Excuse me. My name's Joe Amazzo.

33:29.199 --> 33:30.898
I'm a scout for the San Diego Padres.

33:30.934 --> 33:33.668
Can I get a minute of your time?

33:33.703 --> 33:35.669
And there she is.

33:35.704 --> 33:38.405
Jacket's coming off,
towel in its proper place.

33:38.441 --> 33:40.686
Perhaps a prayer or two.

33:40.822 --> 33:45.105
When we come back, Ginny Baker
takes the mound again.

33:53.616 --> 33:55.382
All right, let's go!

34:06.328 --> 34:08.598
Well, if you thought Ginny Baker

34:08.599 --> 34:10.440
had the weight of the
world on her shoulders

34:10.465 --> 34:11.630
in her last start,

34:11.666 --> 34:13.233
now she gets to take on

34:13.268 --> 34:14.534
the first-place Giants.

34:29.516 --> 34:30.882
Here's the wind and the pitch.

34:39.359 --> 34:41.692
Another delivery in the dirt.

34:41.728 --> 34:43.761
Joe, I really can't take this again.

34:43.795 --> 34:46.163
I'm gonna go home. Can I just go home?

34:46.197 --> 34:48.678
You have to stay here. Don't
leave me alone for this.

34:51.871 --> 34:54.170
It's getting a little
repetitive, don't you think?

34:54.206 --> 34:55.851
Yeah, I suppose this is
the part of the movie

34:55.875 --> 34:58.475
where I give the great speech
that saves the day.

34:58.510 --> 34:59.776
Yeah.

34:59.811 --> 35:01.188
Been trying to think about which speech

35:01.212 --> 35:02.579
to pull out for the occasion.

35:02.614 --> 35:03.891
I mean, Lord knows
I've had a lot of time

35:03.915 --> 35:05.282
to think about it lately.

35:05.317 --> 35:06.728
Taking those long walks to the backstop

35:06.752 --> 35:08.585
to pick up your wild pitches.

35:08.620 --> 35:10.219
Come on, Mike, let's keep it moving.

35:10.255 --> 35:12.255
Sam, I need a moment.

35:13.357 --> 35:15.357
You're my favorite.
You always have been.

35:15.393 --> 35:17.192
He's not my favorite.

35:17.227 --> 35:19.428
- Where were we?
- Your speech.

35:19.463 --> 35:21.697
Okay.

35:21.732 --> 35:23.365
Here's what I got.

35:23.401 --> 35:25.467
I've been watching you
this past week, Baker.

35:25.503 --> 35:26.813
Seems like you've got a
lot of people telling you

35:26.837 --> 35:28.604
who you're doing this for,

35:28.639 --> 35:30.583
and I wonder if it's not
about time you start doing this

35:30.607 --> 35:31.773
for yourself.

35:31.808 --> 35:33.240
Just you.

35:33.276 --> 35:34.709
Screw all the attention.

35:34.744 --> 35:36.622
And you know what? Screw all
those adorable little girls

35:36.646 --> 35:38.313
in the crowd with their
Ginny Baker signs.

35:38.348 --> 35:40.515
'Cause you're not a
Girl Scout leader, rookie.

35:40.550 --> 35:41.716
You're a ballplayer.

35:44.854 --> 35:46.487
You do this for you,

35:46.523 --> 35:47.688
you do this for your team,

35:47.723 --> 35:49.066
or you don't do it at all.

35:49.195 --> 35:50.602
'Cause you can't aim your pitches

35:50.626 --> 35:52.258
if you're aiming to please everyone.

35:52.294 --> 35:55.362
I literally just came up with that

35:55.397 --> 35:57.897
on the spot, I mean, "Aim
your pitches, aim to please"?

35:57.933 --> 35:59.433
Damn, I'm good.

35:59.468 --> 36:00.634
I really could be in movies.

36:00.669 --> 36:01.935
Got to go.

36:01.970 --> 36:03.415
You know, people
are gonna start talking.

36:03.439 --> 36:05.471
It's kind of getting awkward now.

36:05.506 --> 36:06.939
Hey.

36:06.974 --> 36:08.407
Mic drop.

36:21.788 --> 36:24.422
Here's a 2-0 pitch.

36:24.458 --> 36:25.757
It's a perfect strike.

36:25.792 --> 36:27.392
Right down the middle of the plate.

36:27.427 --> 36:28.760
Right down Broadway.

36:28.795 --> 36:29.794
She needed that.

36:34.768 --> 36:35.967
Grounder to short.

36:36.002 --> 36:38.202
Hannon up with it.

36:38.238 --> 36:39.703
One away.

36:39.739 --> 36:42.540
And Ginny Baker has recorded
her first out

36:42.541 --> 36:43.532
in the Major League.

36:43.557 --> 36:45.776
Sometimes that's
the toughest one to get.

36:45.811 --> 36:49.346
Two on, two out here
in the third, a run in.

36:56.521 --> 36:57.953
Called! Strike three.

36:57.989 --> 36:59.489
Wow.

37:10.602 --> 37:12.634
Uh-oh, this could be trouble.

37:12.669 --> 37:15.270
Sanders... what a catch!

37:17.775 --> 37:19.808
After four innings,

37:19.843 --> 37:21.810
Padres, three, and the Giants, two.

37:21.845 --> 37:25.380
You know, people
sometimes tell me I'm like

37:25.416 --> 37:27.048
a Latino Gerard Butler.

37:32.688 --> 37:35.689
I'm sorry, but, if I'm not
mistaken, Mr. Arguella,

37:35.725 --> 37:38.459
you are a married man.
Actually, I'm separated.

37:38.494 --> 37:41.662
But it's nice to know that
you've been checking up on me.

37:41.697 --> 37:45.332
All right, here it is,
4-3 Padres, bases loaded

37:45.367 --> 37:49.436
one out, and a
full-count on the Giants' slugger.

37:49.471 --> 37:52.605
- This is tough.
- Baker's thrown Shiazzo

37:52.641 --> 37:54.477
two straight screwballs.

37:54.667 --> 37:58.377
There's nowhere to put him, you
know he's thinking fastball.

38:28.608 --> 38:30.407
And the payoff pitch.

38:38.684 --> 38:41.050
Got him!

38:43.121 --> 38:44.833
Stayed with the screwball.
That takes guts.

38:44.857 --> 38:46.723
Wow.

38:55.933 --> 38:57.867
Ball four, she walked him.

38:59.103 --> 39:00.803
And here comes Al.

39:00.838 --> 39:02.705
And that may be all for Ginny Baker,

39:02.740 --> 39:04.874
with the lefty Morris coming up.

39:04.909 --> 39:07.810
Six and a third, eight hits, three runs,

39:07.845 --> 39:09.912
five strikeouts.
You know, if the bullpen

39:09.947 --> 39:11.746
holds this lead, she'll get the win.

39:11.781 --> 39:13.815
What a gutty performance.

39:13.850 --> 39:15.628
And off her last start, it might as well

39:15.652 --> 39:17.463
- have been a no-hitter, Joe.
- I can get out of it.

39:17.487 --> 39:19.420
She's done.

39:19.455 --> 39:20.855
I said I can go another.

39:20.891 --> 39:22.356
And I decided otherwise.

39:22.392 --> 39:23.569
And I'm still the skipper here,

39:23.593 --> 39:25.167
- am I not, Baker?
- Yes, sir.

39:25.168 --> 39:27.673
Because there's been some confusion
about that lately.

39:27.697 --> 39:29.563
And as long as you're gonna
be sticking around,

39:29.598 --> 39:32.833
I'd like some order restored
in my damn clubhouse.

39:36.005 --> 39:38.005
Good job, rook.

39:38.040 --> 39:39.640
We'll take it from here.

39:39.675 --> 39:41.775
Go take your bow.

39:43.512 --> 39:45.078
She doesn't like the ass-slapping.

39:45.113 --> 39:46.946
Good to know.

39:49.651 --> 39:53.419
Just listen to this crowd.

39:53.454 --> 39:55.021
Welcome to the big leagues, Ginny.

39:55.056 --> 39:57.857
We've been waiting for you.

40:17.611 --> 40:18.877
Whatever.

40:22.615 --> 40:24.682
Nice win, Pitch.

40:24.717 --> 40:27.851
Thanks, Tommy.

40:27.887 --> 40:29.519
Enjoy your moment in the sun.

40:29.555 --> 40:31.555
'Cause there's 29 pro teams as we speak

40:31.591 --> 40:33.891
figuring out that little
trick pitch of yours,

40:33.926 --> 40:35.980
and when they do, I'll get my job back

40:35.981 --> 40:38.539
and you'll become the answer
to a trivia question.

40:38.563 --> 40:41.030
Okay.

40:41.066 --> 40:42.498
Bitch.

40:42.533 --> 40:44.200
Hey, Tommy, who's the bitch, huh?

40:44.235 --> 40:46.469
- Why don't you say it to my face?
- Hey, walk away.

40:46.504 --> 40:47.782
Stay out of this, Sanders.

40:47.806 --> 40:49.472
- Walk away.
- Why do I get the feeling

40:49.507 --> 40:51.908
you've tapped that ass?

40:56.914 --> 40:57.946
Cut it out!

40:57.982 --> 41:01.483
Come on, Tommy!

41:04.888 --> 41:06.989
Okay, yeah.

41:07.024 --> 41:10.125
No, I'm on top of it, thank you.

41:10.160 --> 41:11.826
So there I am, pouring myself

41:11.861 --> 41:14.762
a glass of an absurdly expensive Scotch,

41:14.797 --> 41:17.231
celebrating one of the biggest
nights of my life,

41:17.266 --> 41:20.034
when I get a call from a reporter asking

41:20.069 --> 41:22.837
for a comment on the post-game brawl.

41:22.872 --> 41:24.282
I was just about to call you...

41:24.283 --> 41:25.884
We got something here, Oscar.

41:25.908 --> 41:27.907
We have ourselves a moment.

41:27.943 --> 41:29.943
Yes, we do.

41:29.978 --> 41:31.911
Now, I know you love Al.

41:31.947 --> 41:34.614
Yes, I do.

41:34.650 --> 41:36.249
He's a good manager,

41:36.284 --> 41:39.052
but the world changed
tonight, Oscar, and I'm not convinced

41:39.087 --> 41:41.788
that he's the man to take
us into the new one.

41:41.823 --> 41:43.823
He's lost control of the team.

41:43.859 --> 41:45.223
Well, what are you gonna do?

41:45.259 --> 41:48.927
What am I gonna do?

41:48.963 --> 41:51.063
I'm going to return to my office

41:51.098 --> 41:53.532
and drink my absurdly expensive Scotch.

41:53.567 --> 41:57.903
But you, my friend,
you are going to get me...

41:57.938 --> 41:59.571
a short list.

42:30.569 --> 42:32.703
The San Diego Padres.

42:32.738 --> 42:33.904
Yup.

42:33.939 --> 42:35.738
The majors.

42:35.773 --> 42:37.339
The minors.

42:39.276 --> 42:40.876
We did it, Pop.

42:44.682 --> 42:46.182
Pop, come on.

43:07.204 --> 43:08.937
Dad?

43:18.814 --> 43:19.980
Dad!

43:30.058 --> 43:32.625
That's confirmed... fatality.

43:58.986 --> 44:00.951
Again.

44:05.724 --> 44:08.025
Again.

44:13.365 --> 44:15.632
We did it, Pop.

44:15.668 --> 44:18.968
We ain't done nothin' yet.
