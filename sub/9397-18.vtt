<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.440 --> 00:04.476
- Marry me.
- We're engaged.

00:04.560 --> 00:07.552
Me and your mom talked it over.
I'd like to adopt you.

00:08.520 --> 00:10.750
I wanna be your husband again, Haley.

00:11.320 --> 00:15.359
In 1955, students at Tree Hill High School

00:15.440 --> 00:19.035
created a time capsule
that was to be opened in 50 years.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.634
<i>You wanna know</i>
<i>what things were like 50 years ago?</i>

00:21.720 --> 00:23.676
<i>There's not a single person in this place</i>

00:23.760 --> 00:24.909
<i>worth remembering.</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:26.752
<i>Everyone here is a loser.</i>

00:29.400 --> 00:31.118
Now I may have to get you out of here,

00:31.200 --> 00:33.794
but nothing will happen to you, I promise.

00:33.880 --> 00:35.598
You got to let me try to talk to him.

00:35.680 --> 00:39.639
Luke, I love you. Now go.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.832
I wanted them to like me.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.278
- Jimmy, please.
- I'm sorry.

00:45.360 --> 00:46.634
No!

00:46.720 --> 00:48.073
He's gone, Danny.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.111
I released the time capsule.

00:54.440 --> 00:55.793
I don't like you.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.271
Hey, Luke, we gotta go.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.270
So Mom, I'm gonna take off, okay?

02:00.520 --> 02:01.509
Hello?

02:10.440 --> 02:13.079
Well, I'll be on my cell
if you need anything.

02:14.320 --> 02:17.596
Don't take it personally.
She's been through a lot.

02:18.240 --> 02:20.356
I know. She just seems so hopeless.

02:20.680 --> 02:23.274
Yeah, we're all gonna
get our hope back, Luke.

02:23.400 --> 02:26.039
It's just gonna take some of us
longer than others, you know.

02:26.120 --> 02:27.314
<i>Henry James wrote,</i>

02:27.400 --> 02:31.313
<i>"Be not afraid of life.</i>
<i>Believe that life is worth living,</i>

02:31.400 --> 02:34.198
<i>"and your belief will help create the fact."</i>

02:37.760 --> 02:39.671
I have a feeling
this is gonna be a great weekend.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.637
Yeah, it will be kind of nice to get away.

02:41.720 --> 02:45.713
Yeah, hopefully it'll get everybody to stop
talking about you-know-what for a while.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.268
Hey, does anybody know anything
about this place we're going to?

02:48.360 --> 02:50.828
All Rachel said is that
it's some kind of cabin.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.753
Does Rachel really have to come?
Can't we just leave her?

02:53.840 --> 02:57.276
Considering it's her family's place,
I don't really think we have an option.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.316
I'm just saying think about it.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.228
Hey, party people.

03:01.320 --> 03:03.709
Hey, baby, you ready to conquer
the great outdoors?

03:03.800 --> 03:05.358
- Lf you say so.
- Skills!

03:05.440 --> 03:06.953
He didn't sound very enthusiastic.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.712
Yeah, Skills isn't really the outdoor type.

03:08.800 --> 03:09.915
That's okay, Pete isn't either,

03:10.000 --> 03:11.399
and he's still gonna try
to meet us out there.

03:11.480 --> 03:13.152
- Who's Pete?
- Fall Out Boy.

03:13.240 --> 03:15.913
- He's Peyton's imaginary friend.
- Brooke, he's not imaginary.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.197
- You saw us together at the concert.
- And now he loves you.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.078
Wasn't it nice of Pete
to put your bag in the car?

03:23.400 --> 03:24.469
You guys, he's coming.

03:24.560 --> 03:27.313
Hey, you know what?
Kanye rolling through, too.

03:30.840 --> 03:33.115
Skills, we are only gonna be gone
for two nights.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.315
What is in that thing?

03:34.400 --> 03:37.949
Look, baby, if I'm going to be in the middle
of the woods, I need all of my stuff.

03:38.040 --> 03:41.077
- CD, DVD, MP3, my pillow.
- Wait, wait.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.594
But you know we're not staying
in the woods. There's a cabin.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.638
- Think less rustic.
- How much less rustic?

03:56.200 --> 03:58.316
Now, this is my kind of roughing it.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.190
I thought you might like it. Come on.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.992
- Rachel, this place is awesome.
- It's been in my family for years.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.992
We hardly come here anymore.
My dad mostly loans it out to clients.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.195
The kitchen's fully loaded.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.350
There's a river for fishing,
ATVs in the garage,

04:16.440 --> 04:18.237
plasma screen upstairs
and a hot tub in the back.

04:18.320 --> 04:20.629
There's five bedrooms.
Take any one but the master.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.233
Let's check them out.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.071
Man, this is nice.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.920
What does Rachel's dad do
for a living, anyway?

04:36.000 --> 04:39.276
I don't know.
Maybe he's like Tony Soprano.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.556
That would explain her personality.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.349
Look, Rachel did a very nice thing
by inviting us here.

04:44.440 --> 04:46.908
Maybe this would be a good weekend
to take it easy on her.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.833
But isn't the point of this weekend
for us to get back to normal?

04:49.920 --> 04:51.751
If Rachel and I aren't back
at each other's throats,

04:51.840 --> 04:53.910
it's like the terrorists have won.

04:56.320 --> 04:57.992
- Look at you.
- What?

04:58.160 --> 05:00.720
Your smile. I've missed it.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.594
Well, then, here's something
to make you smile.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.718
- My latest letter.
- Yay, more mail!

05:09.920 --> 05:12.673
Well, this one
I really think you're gonna like.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.159
This weekend is so gonna pay off for you.

05:22.360 --> 05:25.909
You better grab a bed.
The good ones are going fast.

05:26.080 --> 05:29.197
- The couch is fine with me.
- Mouth, don't be stupid.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.352
Tell you what,
why don't you just bunk with me?

05:32.440 --> 05:33.953
Like I said, I'm good.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.831
So, that's how it's gonna be?

05:38.920 --> 05:41.514
You don't think I know
what this weekend's about?

05:41.600 --> 05:45.354
This is about you trying to relieve
your guilt over the time capsule.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.638
If you hate me so much,
why did you even come?

05:48.720 --> 05:51.473
I came for my friends, especially Lucas.

05:51.840 --> 05:55.958
But make no mistake.
I'm here for everybody but you.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.553
- Nice jump back there.
- You, too.

06:45.640 --> 06:48.029
I think we totally scared the crap
out of some cows.

06:48.120 --> 06:49.439
You know what?
Maybe we should be careful.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.158
I don't know,
given our family driving history,

06:51.240 --> 06:53.800
one of us is bound to end up
in the hospital.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.476
Hey, check this out.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.717
- Haley's ring?
- Yeah, I swiped it a couple of minutes ago.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.908
- I need you to hold onto that for me.
- Why?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.275
Because I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.395
Okay, I'm sorry,
but didn't you already do that?

07:11.480 --> 07:15.155
Yeah, but I was thinking
about Keith and your mom

07:15.240 --> 07:17.629
and how they never got
a chance to stand in front

07:17.720 --> 07:21.110
of their family and friends and tell
everybody how they feel, you know?

07:21.200 --> 07:23.270
- Yeah.
- And Haley and I never did that, either.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.989
So, now that we're back together,
I wanna do things the right way.

07:29.480 --> 07:33.632
Dude, these things are awesome!
I just scared the hell out of some cows!

07:38.560 --> 07:39.595
So what do you think, man?

07:39.680 --> 07:41.398
- You gonna help me out?
- Yeah.

07:41.480 --> 07:45.029
But you do know Haley's gonna freak
when she notices her ring's gone.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.792
This cannot be happening.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.872
- What?
- My ring is gone!

07:48.960 --> 07:50.029
- Your wedding ring?
- Yep.

07:50.120 --> 07:51.951
- Why'd you take it off?
- Is that really important right now?

07:52.040 --> 07:55.112
Okay, Haley. Calm down.
Just stop. Hey, stop!

07:55.200 --> 07:57.350
We'll find it.
Think. Where did you have it last?

07:57.440 --> 07:59.954
I don't know. I had it in the car ride
on the way over here.

08:00.040 --> 08:04.955
And then I just started unpacking,
and then I... I think...

08:06.560 --> 08:10.075
I think... I think I actually took it off
when I washed my hands.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.633
Oh, my God. If I washed it down the drain
Nathan is gonna freak out.

08:13.720 --> 08:14.755
Haley, chill, okay?

08:14.840 --> 08:16.876
Even if it is down the drain,
we can still get it back.

08:16.960 --> 08:18.279
Do you have a pipe wrench?

08:18.360 --> 08:20.430
Oh, sure, in my purse
next to the belt sander.

08:20.520 --> 08:24.593
Listen, jokey, go find a pipe wrench,
or I'll find one and beat you with it, okay?

08:24.680 --> 08:27.240
So glad I invited you. I'll get the toolbox.

08:34.159 --> 08:35.912
Okay, time to cry.

08:48.520 --> 08:51.034
Okay, I need to find Lucas.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.915
Hi, guys. Have you seen Lucas?

09:04.000 --> 09:07.436
Yeah, he's out in the woods driving ATMs
with Nathan and Mouth.

09:07.720 --> 09:11.918
Did he say when he was coming back?
'Cause I need him for something.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.675
- Anything we can help you with?
- No, this definitely requires Lucas.

09:16.680 --> 09:19.831
I'm gonna take a nap before dinner. Bye.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.430
- She was horny, right?
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

09:27.520 --> 09:29.795
- You ready to get in?
- Maybe for a couple of minutes.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.393
You know,
the Hornets about to play the Rockets,

09:31.480 --> 09:33.357
and I really want to check out
that big screen.

09:33.440 --> 09:37.194
But wouldn't you rather check out
my big screen?

09:38.440 --> 09:42.399
That really don't make no sense,
but somehow I don't care.

09:50.560 --> 09:51.834
What is that?

09:52.240 --> 09:55.073
Well, hopefully it's the crap
hiding your ring.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.837
So, we just sift through it?

10:00.560 --> 10:03.950
Oh, no, no. We don't sift through it.

10:05.680 --> 10:06.795
Look, maybe it's not in there.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.313
Where else in the house have you been?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.630
Just to check out the other bedrooms.

10:18.360 --> 10:21.272
- Sorry!
- Doesn't anybody knock anymore?

10:23.080 --> 10:25.116
- Did you find it?
- Not exactly.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.191
That was not what it looked like.
You saw nothing.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.430
Brooke, I'm so sorry.
I was just looking for Haley's ring.

10:29.520 --> 10:32.830
I had no idea that you'd be in there,
Brooking yourself.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.359
Very funny.
Now I suppose you're gonna go

10:34.440 --> 10:35.589
and blab about this to everybody.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.511
Brooke, I promise. I won't say a thing.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.238
Haley, find your ring?

10:39.360 --> 10:42.830
No, I didn't. I found, like, a nickel
and a really gross assortment of drain hair

10:42.920 --> 10:44.319
dating back to the late '80s.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.391
Your wedding ring?
Nathan is gonna kill you.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.436
- Yeah, I know. Thanks, Brooke.
- The bathroom's a mess.

10:48.520 --> 10:50.954
Are there any extra paper towels in here?

10:52.320 --> 10:54.880
- Why is it locked?
- Sorry, this cabinet's off-limits.

10:54.960 --> 10:57.520
- Why? What's in there?
- It's just private.

10:57.720 --> 11:00.757
You know how people
don't like private things revealed.

11:02.720 --> 11:06.030
So, look at the time.
Hey, the guys from Sunkist called.

11:06.120 --> 11:08.111
They're hosting this club night
tonight not too far from here,

11:08.200 --> 11:10.191
- so I thought maybe we could go.
- Tonight? What about my ring?

11:10.280 --> 11:14.068
Haley, we will find your ring.
In the meantime, just hide that finger.

11:36.800 --> 11:37.835
Why are you wearing those mittens?

11:37.920 --> 11:39.956
It's like a million degrees in here.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.996
My hands are just cold tonight.

11:42.680 --> 11:45.148
So you never said anything
about my letter.

11:45.680 --> 11:49.958
Oh, your letter.
It had a surprising effect on me.

11:50.280 --> 11:51.759
Well, I hoped that it would.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.400
Yeah, who knew words
could be such a turn-on.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.389
- I'm having the best time.
- Me, too.

12:01.800 --> 12:05.679
- Apparently, not everyone else is.
- I'll be right back.

12:10.720 --> 12:14.030
If you're coming over here to say
"I told you so," save your breath.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.998
- You haven't heard from Pete yet?
- No.

12:17.240 --> 12:19.037
Well, maybe Pete lost his phone.

12:19.120 --> 12:22.556
Okay, this whole finger quotes thing
is starting to piss me off.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.428
Listen, some guy named Rudy
keeps asking me to dance,

12:25.520 --> 12:27.476
so if you could help me out,
that'd be great.

12:27.560 --> 12:28.709
- Just go.
- Okay.

13:16.160 --> 13:19.311
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.998
I was just thinking
about how beautiful it is here.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.159
It's weird,

13:27.360 --> 13:31.399
but sometimes I have these moments
where I feel like Keith is here with me.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.269
He is.

13:52.280 --> 13:54.111
What are you thinking about?

13:56.280 --> 13:57.679
Truthfully?

13:58.640 --> 14:02.872
Whether it'd be completely pathetic
if I checked again to see if Pete's called.

14:03.760 --> 14:07.958
- I'm sorry, Peyton.
- It's not your fault, Mouth.

14:08.520 --> 14:11.592
No, not for that.
I mean about what happened to you.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.478
You know, with your leg.

14:14.200 --> 14:18.113
Well, that's really sweet, Mouth,
but it's not necessary.

14:20.600 --> 14:25.276
Sometimes I forget to remember
how really wonderful life can be.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.835
So, I'm trying not to do that anymore.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.833
That's great, Peyton. Good for you.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.189
- Good night, Mouth.
- Good night.

14:52.200 --> 14:56.273
Something smells... yummy.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.035
Hi.

15:02.440 --> 15:03.429
Pete?

15:04.600 --> 15:07.319
- What is this?
- Peyton.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.949
I saw him standing here
and just sort of thought I was dreaming

15:12.040 --> 15:14.554
and went for it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:15.720 --> 15:18.280
- Pete from Fall Out Boy is here.
- I know.

15:21.320 --> 15:24.869
- So I thought you were blowing me off.
- I said I'd be here.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.430
You guys are so adorable.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.550
Hey, look, Pete from Fall Out Boy.
I'm Rachel.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.358
- Thanks for letting me crash your party.
- No problem.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.271
But if you really want to thank me,
there'll be a mushroom

15:37.360 --> 15:40.750
and goat cheese omelet
waiting for me when I finish my shower.

15:41.800 --> 15:42.994
Do we like her?

15:44.320 --> 15:48.791
- Pete from Fall Out Boy. You showed.
- Didn't anyone think I was going to show?

15:49.760 --> 15:52.069
Hey, come on,
I gotta show you something.

15:59.320 --> 16:02.278
Okay, what do you wanna show me?
It's freezing out here.

16:02.800 --> 16:06.713
- This.
- Are you proposing to me?

16:06.960 --> 16:08.632
Lucas, this is really Naley...

16:08.720 --> 16:11.792
No, no, no. This is Haley's ring.
Nathan stole it.

16:11.880 --> 16:14.474
I'm just holding onto it
till he proposes to her again tomorrow.

16:14.560 --> 16:17.233
Like a re-proposal? She's already had one.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.834
Nathan wants to have this big,
fancy wedding.

16:19.920 --> 16:22.195
Oh, that is so romantic!

16:22.440 --> 16:27.150
Oh, what is so romantic?
Oh, is that my ring?

16:27.560 --> 16:31.473
- Yeah. I found it. Surprise.
- Oh, my God! Thank you!

16:31.560 --> 16:33.312
Where did you find this?

16:35.400 --> 16:37.277
It was on the thing next to the other thing.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.238
I've been looking for this everywhere.
Thank you so much.

16:40.320 --> 16:42.356
You're not gonna tell Nathan, are you?

16:42.440 --> 16:44.954
- Nope. I wouldn't do that.
- Thank you.

16:45.480 --> 16:47.118
Oh, God, you're the best.

16:50.560 --> 16:52.676
- No, I'm pretty much dead.
- Yeah.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.478
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:58.760 --> 17:03.276
So, that's an oak tree.
And over there, that's a slippery elm.

17:03.360 --> 17:06.557
Or to use its Latin name,
<i>Ulmus rubra Muhl.</i>

17:06.680 --> 17:09.194
Right, that's great, baby.
Look, we been walking for a while now.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.759
Shouldn't we drop bread crumbs
or something?

17:10.839 --> 17:14.799
- Hey, look, badger droppings!
- Yeah, baby. Look, I'm not looking at that.

17:14.920 --> 17:18.230
Skills, relax.
I have an awesome sense of direction.

17:18.440 --> 17:21.352
- I always know where north is.
- Right. North, huh?

17:21.839 --> 17:23.990
- Yep.
- Okay, I got a little experiment.

17:24.079 --> 17:25.398
Close your eyes.

17:30.120 --> 17:33.351
Now, open your eyes.
Now, point north again.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.114
There. North. Ha!

17:36.920 --> 17:39.195
Before, when you pointed,
you pointed that way.

17:39.280 --> 17:40.633
- Uh-uh.
- Yes, you did.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.553
Before, when you pointed,
those berries was on your left-hand side.

17:43.640 --> 17:46.677
- Now which side they on?
- Skills, I said I'm good with directions.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.876
Not this whole left-right thingy.

17:49.440 --> 17:50.919
Great, so we lost.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.798
I don't know how I let you
talk me into this, man.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.991
So thanks for going
on this walk with me, Pete.

18:03.080 --> 18:05.833
The doctor says
it's good therapy for my leg.

18:06.520 --> 18:09.080
No problem. You know,
your friends are pretty cool, too.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.390
Oh, God, well, you should've heard
all the crap they were giving me

18:11.480 --> 18:12.993
before you showed up.

18:13.280 --> 18:16.272
I was starting to get scared
you were gonna be my Snuffleupagus.

18:16.360 --> 18:19.557
- Your Snuffa... What?
- My Snuffleupagus.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.873
You watched <i>Sesame Street,</i> right?

18:21.960 --> 18:24.679
No, I was kind of more like, you know,
like a <i>Transformers</i> kind of kid.

18:24.760 --> 18:26.352
Oh, no, okay, well...

18:26.760 --> 18:29.354
Snuffleupagus is like this big, hairy,

18:29.440 --> 18:33.399
mopey, elephant thing
that only Big Bird could see.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.357
And so, whenever he talked
about him to other people,

18:35.440 --> 18:37.510
everyone thought Big Bird
was just making him up.

18:37.600 --> 18:40.160
Right, so Snuffleupagus
would just show up

18:40.240 --> 18:42.834
- and start cooking everybody breakfast...
- No!

18:43.160 --> 18:45.151
Okay, maybe something like that.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.559
So this is like...

18:50.080 --> 18:52.753
I don't know,
I just never would've pictured this.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.832
You know, a famous rock star showing up
in the middle of nowhere

18:55.920 --> 18:58.309
to hang out with a girl he barely knows.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.117
- Actually, that's not true.
- What is?

19:04.200 --> 19:05.952
I mean, even though
we just met each other,

19:06.040 --> 19:08.156
I feel like I know you pretty well.

19:08.520 --> 19:09.999
How do you figure?

19:10.080 --> 19:14.517
Well, I listened to your podcasts
and your artwork, your dad,

19:14.720 --> 19:17.439
everything with Ellie, that Jake guy...

19:17.520 --> 19:20.592
Okay, well, if you're gonna put it that way,

19:20.680 --> 19:23.240
I guess I probably
know you pretty well, too.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.993
I mean, I know all the lyrics to your songs.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.877
Like, "My pen is the barrel of the gun.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.076
"Remind me which side you should be on."

19:31.160 --> 19:32.798
So a hot girl quotes me to me.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.075
Is that wrong if that turns me on?

19:36.120 --> 19:37.599
Maybe a little.

19:39.560 --> 19:43.155
Since we know each other so well,
I guess it's okay if I do this.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.517
You know what? You're right.
This walk was a good idea.

20:01.640 --> 20:03.790
Okay, so it was a bad idea.

20:04.360 --> 20:06.032
Why would you even show
the ring to Brooke?

20:06.120 --> 20:07.553
I don't know. I was excited.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.358
You know how Brooke
likes these kind of things.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.590
The proposal's ruined now, you know.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.474
I mean, you don't need a ring to propose.

20:14.760 --> 20:16.591
You know, you could just adjust your plan
a little bit.

20:16.680 --> 20:18.989
'Cause that's all Haley and I ever do.

20:21.400 --> 20:24.073
Ever since we got married,
nothing's gone the way we planned it.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.479
Something always gets in the way.

20:25.560 --> 20:29.189
Like music or High Flyers or Chris, Dan.

20:29.280 --> 20:32.556
But isn't that just, well, life?

20:32.960 --> 20:34.837
I mean, everything doesn't have
to be perfect.

20:34.920 --> 20:36.672
No, but this does.

20:37.920 --> 20:40.798
Why couldn't this one moment
just work out the way I planned it?

20:40.880 --> 20:42.836
Just once, you know, for Haley.

20:47.360 --> 20:48.554
You're right.

20:50.920 --> 20:54.230
- What are you doing?
- We're going to go get that ring back.

20:52.720 --> 20:53.835
You're right, Nate.

20:56.440 --> 20:59.557
You and Haley deserve
that perfect moment

20:57.640 --> 20:59.392
at least once in your life.

21:01.120 --> 21:04.476
Skills, what are you doing?
We have to keep walking.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.753
For what? So we could get more lost
than we already are?

21:18.480 --> 21:19.879
Look, baby, let's just stay put.

21:21.320 --> 21:24.278
Once it gets dark,
somebody will come looking for us.

21:22.800 --> 21:26.270
- Okay, I'll make a campfire.
- With what?

21:26.080 --> 21:28.469
Girl Scout motto,
"Always come prepared."

21:30.160 --> 21:32.151
- Okay.
- The fire will keep us warm

21:34.800 --> 21:37.075
and attract the rescue helicopters.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.395
Look at my baby. Look at the little Scout.

21:39.240 --> 21:41.595
These matches are pretty old,

21:43.840 --> 21:47.753
- but they still work!
- Okay, cool. Let's see the fire.

21:48.480 --> 21:49.469
What?

21:55.960 --> 21:57.518
That was the last one.

21:58.560 --> 22:01.313
- So how mad was Nathan?
- Not thrilled.

22:08.320 --> 22:11.756
- But I told him I'd get the ring back.
- Great, so get it back.

22:11.440 --> 22:14.989
How? There's no way Haley's gonna
let that ring out of her sight now.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.831
Lucas, there's always a way.

22:18.640 --> 22:19.834
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:27.720 --> 22:28.789
Cute.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.673
You're not seriously wearing
your ring in here, are you?

22:30.160 --> 22:31.309
Yeah, why?

22:32.920 --> 22:35.229
Swirling water, big drain...

22:35.040 --> 22:37.952
You know what?
That's a really good point, actually.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.430
- Thanks, Brooke.
- Yeah.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.029
Brooke.

22:58.760 --> 22:59.988
What the hell?

23:25.080 --> 23:26.877
Hey, Lucas, it's getting dark out.

23:35.560 --> 23:36.959
What are Bevin and Skills doing?

23:37.440 --> 23:39.192
If they stay out much longer,
they're gonna miss dinner.

23:38.920 --> 23:41.036
You're right. You got a flashlight?

23:40.760 --> 23:42.830
Perfect. Be right back.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.513
Bevin!

23:56.200 --> 23:57.633
Skills!

23:58.920 --> 24:00.273
Bevin! Skills!

24:03.280 --> 24:04.315
- You hear that?
- What?

24:04.720 --> 24:08.315
- That voice. It sounded like Lucas.
- Where's that light coming from?

24:05.840 --> 24:06.829
Come on.

24:10.600 --> 24:13.592
Skills! Bevin! Skills!

24:11.720 --> 24:12.948
Bevin!

24:15.360 --> 24:18.079
- Man, that is Lucas!
- You guys coming to dinner or what?

24:18.440 --> 24:20.829
You mean to tell me that house has
been there the whole damn time?

24:21.240 --> 24:23.310
I told you I knew where north was.

24:23.720 --> 24:26.792
Yeah, I guess between me losing my ring
and Bevin and Skills losing themselves,

24:29.840 --> 24:32.115
it has been a pretty eventful weekend.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.992
- I thought you were gonna get that ring.
- Brooke's working on it.

24:37.960 --> 24:40.235
Yeah, well, you're running out of time.

24:41.040 --> 24:44.350
Hey, guys, I got an idea.
How about we play "I Never"?

24:45.960 --> 24:49.191
Oh, yeah, that always turns out great.
Catfight with Nicki anyone?

24:49.360 --> 24:51.237
Come on, it'll be fun. I'll start.

24:52.680 --> 24:55.717
I never had a gold record.

24:54.640 --> 24:58.110
- Come on, that's easy.
- Drink up!

24:58.280 --> 25:00.953
- Okay, Pete, you do one.
- Okay.

25:02.680 --> 25:05.752
I've never spent a cool weekend
in the woods.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.278
- All right.
- That's cute.

25:09.480 --> 25:14.110
- Okay, that was lame.
- Okay, that was rude.

25:11.880 --> 25:13.233
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:16.600 --> 25:17.999
Okay, my turn.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.436
I never got caught Brooking myself
in the bedroom yesterday.

25:20.480 --> 25:23.631
- You said you weren't gonna tell.
- We didn't shake on it.

25:26.320 --> 25:29.039
- Wait. Brooking yourself? What is that?
- It's...

25:31.120 --> 25:32.519
Oh, no.

25:34.280 --> 25:35.395
Okay!

25:39.200 --> 25:40.918
Come on, Brooke, drink up.

25:41.520 --> 25:43.556
Wait, hold on, Bevin. Why you drinking?

25:45.960 --> 25:47.439
You even know what that means?

25:48.080 --> 25:50.036
I Brooke myself all the time.

25:49.640 --> 25:50.709
If she keep on talking like that,

25:56.320 --> 25:57.833
I might have to Brooke myself.

25:57.480 --> 25:58.549
Okay!

25:59.080 --> 26:01.196
Can we please stop calling it that?

26:02.400 --> 26:05.870
That is not attractive on you. Stop it!

26:12.120 --> 26:15.635
- Yo, you okay?
- Yeah.

26:17.920 --> 26:21.390
I was just trying to think of an
"I Never," and I realized

26:23.840 --> 26:27.549
I never spent enough time
with him, you know? Keith.

26:27.400 --> 26:28.879
But it's weird.

26:32.760 --> 26:36.435
Even though he's gone,
a part of me just still feels really happy

26:36.040 --> 26:37.917
for the time that I did have.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.519
Well, I think that's what
this weekend's about.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.357
You know, not regretting our pasts,

26:47.160 --> 26:50.152
but appreciating everything
that we've got now.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.759
Great friends, great memories...

26:52.120 --> 26:53.519
And you know what?

26:57.280 --> 26:59.748
I think it's exactly how he would want it.

27:01.560 --> 27:03.710
Hey, Brooke. You here to give me a hand?

27:11.000 --> 27:12.274
Sorry. It just slipped out.

27:13.240 --> 27:16.038
That's funny for a girl
who should be watching her back.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.830
Brooke Davis, are you threatening me?

27:17.480 --> 27:19.630
Let's just say payback's a bitch.

27:20.920 --> 27:23.514
Look, I know you have your issues
with Rachel,

27:26.960 --> 27:29.110
but we all really needed this weekend.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.278
You still glad we came?

27:31.880 --> 27:33.518
Of course. I'm with you.

27:33.600 --> 27:36.194
- But we still need to get that ring back.
- Yeah.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.833
- Any idea?
- No, you?

27:42.840 --> 27:45.877
- Wait a second.
- You got something?

27:48.800 --> 27:51.473
Yeah, but it's not subtle.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.399
Oh, Haley. I'm so sorry.

28:00.080 --> 28:02.719
I tripped over the table.
Here, here, let me...

28:01.640 --> 28:04.518
Let me soak this in club soda.
You should go take a shower or...

28:04.480 --> 28:06.471
- That's not a bad idea, actually.
- I'm sorry.

28:07.440 --> 28:12.150
- It's okay.
- God, it's terrible. This is really bad.

28:09.520 --> 28:10.873
Take care of that. I'll be right back.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.836
You know, I had a really
great time today, Peyton.

28:50.680 --> 28:52.033
Yeah, me, too.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.392
I probably should go sleep
on the couch, though.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.393
Yeah, you should,

28:58.720 --> 29:01.712
but you're not going to.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.750
So how many tattoos
do you have, anyway?

29:11.360 --> 29:15.069
Let's see, 37. No, wait, 38.

29:13.520 --> 29:16.557
I just got your name on my lower calf.
You all right with that?

29:17.320 --> 29:20.995
- Shut up! Stop it!
- So what about you, Peyton?

29:20.440 --> 29:23.432
- You got any tats?
- I just have this dark angel

29:24.200 --> 29:26.634
- between my shoulder blades.
- Really?

29:27.280 --> 29:30.875
No. Can you imagine what my dad
would do if I came home with a tattoo?

29:30.720 --> 29:32.631
- I'm in high school.
- Right.

29:34.400 --> 29:37.437
Speaking of which,
how's this supposed to work, anyway?

29:37.080 --> 29:39.913
- What, me and you?
- Yeah.

29:40.280 --> 29:42.316
I mean, we're just
in two totally different places.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.909
You're this rock star.

29:45.640 --> 29:47.915
I'm just trying to pass AP English.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.680
I mean, I feel like the answer's
to not overthink things.

29:51.960 --> 29:54.235
- You know, we're just having fun, right?
- Yeah, sure.

29:54.600 --> 29:57.512
- And then we'll figure it out.
- So, that's your solution?

29:56.960 --> 30:00.555
- We'll just figure it out?
- Why not? Too easy?

29:59.960 --> 30:03.839
Whatever it is, can you figure it out soon?
I'm trying to sleep up here.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.872
Mouth, how long have you been up there?

30:08.720 --> 30:10.756
Since you guys came in
and started making out.

30:10.400 --> 30:13.312
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. Mouth!

30:12.520 --> 30:16.399
- Did you know he was up there?
- Totally. I thought you were cool with it.

30:15.520 --> 30:16.555
Oh, God.

30:20.440 --> 30:21.793
Oh, crap.

30:24.560 --> 30:26.596
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:40.160 --> 30:43.709
You've done a great thing, Rachel.
Having everyone here like this.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.909
Even if it's all about me relieving my guilt?

30:53.200 --> 30:57.910
I was wrong. People are healing.
Lucas, Haley.

30:55.680 --> 30:58.478
Peyton's really healing with that Pete guy.

31:01.320 --> 31:04.312
Still doesn't make up for me
opening the time capsule.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.553
- You know, I never asked why you did it.
- Mouth...

31:10.400 --> 31:13.597
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to. I just...

31:13.240 --> 31:16.437
I just want to understand
why you opened the time capsule.

31:19.800 --> 31:23.475
I don't know.
To mess with people, I guess.

31:24.120 --> 31:28.113
I thought if I opened it, it would reveal
everyone for who they really were.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.198
You know, just, like, throw a wrench
in the works and watch them squirm.

31:32.080 --> 31:34.071
I didn't want anyone to die.

31:40.520 --> 31:43.910
- I'm gonna tell everybody that I did it.
- No, you shouldn't.

31:44.240 --> 31:46.674
And why not? At least then
they'd have someone to blame.

31:47.720 --> 31:51.395
Rachel, there was so much more going on
with Jimmy than anyone knew,

31:50.240 --> 31:51.798
more than you could've known.

31:54.200 --> 31:55.872
But the time capsule set him off.

31:55.840 --> 31:58.354
And if it hadn't,
something else would have.

31:57.600 --> 32:00.910
I looked at the capsule, too, Rachel.
And it was wrong.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.232
But people are healing now.

32:05.160 --> 32:07.913
Peyton and Lucas,
the people who were hurt the most.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.072
It won't do them any good
to take them back there again.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.308
I say you bury it and keep it buried,

32:14.560 --> 32:17.028
just like the time capsule should've been.

32:18.040 --> 32:21.396
What about you? Can you forgive me?

32:22.720 --> 32:24.472
Only if you can forgive me.

32:29.760 --> 32:32.149
So, you want some company in there or...

32:35.080 --> 32:37.958
I think I can probably squeeze you in.

32:38.920 --> 32:43.391
I'm sorry, Mouth.
I wish I could take it all back.

32:52.520 --> 32:54.511
Yeah, me, too.

32:57.080 --> 32:58.718
What's that scar there?

33:07.760 --> 33:09.398
From when I was six.

33:12.120 --> 33:15.192
When I went on this camping trip
with my mom and Keith.

33:13.920 --> 33:16.480
It was the first time I'd ever gone fishing.

33:18.400 --> 33:21.551
And I accidentally hooked myself
right through the thumb.

33:21.120 --> 33:23.634
- Ouch.
- Yeah. Hurt like hell.

33:24.840 --> 33:28.515
Well, I started crying.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.960
So, Keith takes out his pocketknife

33:33.640 --> 33:35.949
and cuts his thumb, too,

33:37.040 --> 33:40.430
and said if we rubbed them together
that we'd be "blood brothers."

33:39.840 --> 33:40.989
That's sweet.

33:43.880 --> 33:48.476
Well, now whenever I look at that scar,
I can remember that time

33:46.600 --> 33:47.919
and feel good.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.118
But what about my mom?

33:55.320 --> 33:59.836
You know, you said that everybody
will heal eventually.

33:58.920 --> 34:00.558
But what if she doesn't?

34:04.360 --> 34:08.717
I mean, she's just so angry right now

34:07.040 --> 34:09.395
- and tortured.
- I know.

34:11.920 --> 34:15.913
But you've done everything you can.
Everything, right?

34:15.360 --> 34:18.511
And whether she shows it or not,
in her heart, your mom knows

34:19.960 --> 34:23.839
that you're there for her. Promise.

34:23.199 --> 34:27.398
- So what do I do now?
- I don't know.

34:28.040 --> 34:30.349
Have faith that she's gonna get better.

34:33.639 --> 34:35.915
I was going through Keith's belongings,

34:41.560 --> 34:43.630
and I found some things
that I thought you should have.

34:44.520 --> 34:46.909
Things that might mean something to you.

34:46.679 --> 34:50.753
The adoption papers that Keith filed
to father the child that you abandoned.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.911
Invitation to Keith's wedding.

34:57.480 --> 34:58.993
His wedding to Jules, that is,

34:59.840 --> 35:02.308
or Emily or whatever the hell
her name was.

35:01.440 --> 35:05.228
The wedding to the hooker that you hired
to seduce your brother.

35:04.760 --> 35:08.719
Keith Scott Motors. He loved that place.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.914
At least, until you swindled him out of it.

35:17.040 --> 35:18.917
- Karen!
- You killed him.

35:20.520 --> 35:24.433
You may not have pulled the trigger,
but you let him go into that school.

35:24.720 --> 35:27.837
Karen, I had no idea
Keith was going inside.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.832
I was trying to keep everyone safe.
I had responsibility as the mayor.

35:33.640 --> 35:35.631
Responsibility as the mayor!

35:36.640 --> 35:39.359
What about your responsibility
as a brother?

35:38.720 --> 35:42.110
What about your responsibility
as a father?

35:41.720 --> 35:44.518
You had two sons in there, Dan!

35:48.320 --> 35:50.072
Where were you for them?

35:51.600 --> 35:55.718
While Keith was lying there, dying,

35:56.480 --> 35:57.879
where were you?

36:03.760 --> 36:06.638
I wish it had been you

36:11.840 --> 36:14.752
who died in that school.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.155
- Thank you.
- For what?

36:53.920 --> 36:56.514
I know you didn't want to come here,
Skills. But you did anyway.

36:56.360 --> 36:59.477
Of course I did, ma. You're my shorty.

36:59.040 --> 37:01.395
I always wanted to be someone's shorty.

37:03.400 --> 37:06.551
See, the key in whisking is the more
you whisk, the more air becomes trapped,

37:06.680 --> 37:08.352
- makes eggs spongy.
- Oh.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.753
- You look happy.
- You, too.

37:13.320 --> 37:17.029
Oh, man, this view is so beautiful
from the dock.

37:20.080 --> 37:22.310
Well, you know
docks are kind of special for us.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.871
Remember the time
Dan busted us for drinking?

37:26.200 --> 37:27.918
Don't remind me.

37:28.280 --> 37:31.670
Although I have to say I did
kind of enjoy throwing up on him.

37:31.120 --> 37:35.318
So, I couldn't help but notice you've had
your hands in your pockets all weekend.

37:36.240 --> 37:39.676
- What's that about?
- I guess I can't really hide it from you.

37:40.520 --> 37:44.593
I lost my ring. Twice. And I'm really sorry.

37:46.920 --> 37:48.717
You're probably just really
disappointed in me.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.553
You mean this ring?

37:53.000 --> 37:57.755
- Yeah. Where did you find that?
- I kind of stole it. Twice.

37:57.240 --> 37:59.276
- Haley...
- What are you doing?

38:04.480 --> 38:08.712
Over the past year,
I learned so much about life and love.

38:06.880 --> 38:09.917
And even if I could,
I wouldn't take back all the bad stuff

38:11.920 --> 38:13.672
that's happened between us,

38:15.040 --> 38:16.632
because it brought us here.

38:17.080 --> 38:19.230
This moment, this river.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.273
Marry me, Haley.

38:29.320 --> 38:32.517
Marry me again in front
of all our friends and our family.

38:31.320 --> 38:34.392
Always. Always and forever.

38:36.000 --> 38:40.596
- So this is it, huh?
- Peyton, it sucks that I have to go.

38:53.400 --> 38:57.313
But I'm gonna miss you.
Is it okay if I miss you?

38:58.920 --> 39:00.114
You better.

39:03.040 --> 39:06.396
Oh, Peyton, don't worry.
He's just leaving on a rock concert tour.

39:15.160 --> 39:18.152
- It's nothing to be concerned about.
- You're funny.

39:18.600 --> 39:22.513
- Brooke, let's go!
- Sorry. I'm coming.

39:23.320 --> 39:25.038
So, any chance you'll be
riding home with me?

40:02.840 --> 40:05.479
- Forget it.
- Get your ass in the car.

40:04.640 --> 40:06.358
<i>John Steinbeck once wrote,</i>

40:13.800 --> 40:17.395
<i>"Change comes like a little wind</i>
<i>that ruffles the curtains at dawn,</i>

40:16.720 --> 40:21.555
<i>"and it comes like the stealthy perfume</i>
<i>of wildflowers hidden in the grass. "</i>
