- (Tina groaning)
- LOUISE: Tina, why are you wearing those?

00:22.634 --> 00:23.799
You can't walk now.

00:23.835 --> 00:25.401
You couldn't walk so good before.

00:25.436 --> 00:27.503
They're my platform beach espadrilles.
Remember?

00:27.539 --> 00:29.505
The big Eighth Grade Beach
Bonfire is this weekend.

00:29.541 --> 00:31.507
With any luck, Jimmy Junior and I

00:31.543 --> 00:33.976
will be sharing a blanket
and maybe more... blanket.

00:34.012 --> 00:35.978
- If it gets cold.
- Mm.

00:36.014 --> 00:38.147
Sometimes, Jimmy Junior doesn't
look at me when I'm talking,

00:38.182 --> 00:40.316
or listen to me,
so I thought it might help

00:40.351 --> 00:41.851
if I was closer to his face.

00:41.886 --> 00:43.085
Mm-hmm. Guys like it

00:43.121 --> 00:45.087
when you're just right in their face.

00:45.123 --> 00:47.256
Ah! They probably work better in sand.

00:47.292 --> 00:49.458
Hi, guys. Looking forward
to the beach bonfire?

00:49.494 --> 00:51.160
More like bond-fire.

00:51.195 --> 00:53.462
We're gonna roast wienies
and get all philosophical

00:53.498 --> 00:55.464
about growing up,
and then start hugging and stuff.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.199
- Oh. Ow!
- Ha-ha! Get over here!

00:57.235 --> 00:59.335
- Zeke, let go. Ah, Zeke!
- Get over here!

00:59.370 --> 01:00.770
So, Jimmy Junior,

01:00.805 --> 01:03.839
I hear some people are going
to the bonfire as a couple.

01:03.875 --> 01:06.175
Yeah, but most kids
are going in a big group.

01:06.210 --> 01:08.377
Cool, big group.
Hey, back to that couple idea,

01:08.413 --> 01:10.947
maybe we could go early and get
some sticks pre-marshmallowed.

01:10.982 --> 01:12.248
Really hit the ground running?

01:12.283 --> 01:13.649
Uh...

01:13.685 --> 01:15.685
So that's a great idea "uh..."?

01:15.720 --> 01:16.852
Uh...

01:16.888 --> 01:19.188
You'll get back to me "uh..." Got it.

01:19.223 --> 01:20.189
See ya.

01:20.224 --> 01:21.490
So, from down here, that didn't look

01:21.559 --> 01:22.725
like it went great.

01:22.760 --> 01:24.327
(sighs) It's fine.

01:24.362 --> 01:27.063
I'm just gonna walk away,
my head held high.

01:27.098 --> 01:28.064
I'm okay.

01:28.099 --> 01:29.465
So I'm not okay.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.300
No, it's a bad sprain.

01:31.336 --> 01:33.235
You mind if I fool around
with it a little bit?

01:33.271 --> 01:34.704
I want to kind of get in there.

01:34.739 --> 01:36.005
Um, maybe I'll just take some crutches

01:36.040 --> 01:37.573
and get out of your hair. (grunts)

01:38.910 --> 01:41.143
Hey, I'm back from the thrift store.

01:41.179 --> 01:42.845
Did you say good-bye to our old clothes?

01:42.880 --> 01:43.980
Were they sad?

01:44.015 --> 01:45.247
I think they were happy to be back.

01:45.283 --> 01:47.216
I forgot, we bought them there.

01:47.251 --> 01:50.419
Anyway, while I was there,
I happened to see this guy.

01:50.455 --> 01:52.888
Ooh, an old banjo case. What's inside?

01:52.924 --> 01:54.357
Oh, a banjo.

01:54.392 --> 01:55.524
What are you gonna do with it?

01:55.560 --> 01:56.726
Learn to play.

01:56.761 --> 01:59.495
Look, it has a strap so
I can keep it back here,

01:59.530 --> 02:01.564
and then I'm always
ready to pull it around,

02:01.599 --> 02:03.599
'cause you never know
when there's gonna be a...

02:03.635 --> 02:04.767
banjo moment.

02:04.802 --> 02:06.502
What the heck's a "banjo moment"?

02:06.537 --> 02:09.238
Any moment of time that
would be slightly better

02:09.273 --> 02:10.506
with banjo music.

02:10.541 --> 02:13.175
Huh. Uh...

02:13.211 --> 02:15.544
They happen. I mean, not right now,

02:15.580 --> 02:17.546
'cause I don't like how
you're interrogating me.

02:17.582 --> 02:19.215
What?

02:19.250 --> 02:21.851
(sighs) I'm just gonna
put my banjo back in here

02:21.886 --> 02:23.019
and go into the kitchen.

02:23.054 --> 02:24.453
Oh, there's a song there.

02:24.489 --> 02:27.623
♪ Someone's in the kitchen
with the banjo... ♪

02:27.659 --> 02:30.526
Tina, I heard the fantastic
news about your ankle.

02:30.561 --> 02:31.761
Thanks, Mr. Frond.

02:31.796 --> 02:33.295
Wait, "fantastic" news?

02:33.331 --> 02:36.098
Yes! Recently,
we were approached by a tech company,

02:36.134 --> 02:37.800
Yo 'Botics Robotics.

02:37.835 --> 02:39.468
They're looking for a
student to participate

02:39.504 --> 02:41.971
in a robotic mobility pilot program...

02:42.006 --> 02:43.639
Or RUMP for short.

02:43.675 --> 02:44.740
RUMP? I'm listening.

02:44.776 --> 02:47.143
It's a way for mobility-impaired kids

02:47.178 --> 02:49.445
to go to school without going to school!

02:49.480 --> 02:51.213
- How does it work?
- I don't know, Tina.

02:51.249 --> 02:52.314
Do I look like Bill Gates?

02:52.350 --> 02:53.382
Yes, a little.

02:53.418 --> 02:54.784
Well, thank you.

02:54.819 --> 02:56.485
Anyway, you're the perfect candidate.

02:56.521 --> 02:59.121
And I'll be the guy who
brought robots to Wagstaff,

02:59.157 --> 03:01.590
which is some sweet resume candy.

03:01.626 --> 03:04.493

03:04.529 --> 03:05.895

03:05.930 --> 03:07.129
Oh, congratulations.

03:07.165 --> 03:08.764
So, what about RUMP?

03:08.800 --> 03:11.100
They can get you up and running
tomorrow, so to speak.

03:11.135 --> 03:12.635
I don't know,
I'm pretty good with these crutches.

03:12.670 --> 03:13.602
They go under your arm.

03:13.638 --> 03:14.637
They what?

03:14.672 --> 03:16.138
They go under your arm.

03:16.174 --> 03:17.640

Are you seeing us there?

03:24.515 --> 03:25.748
I see you. Hi.

03:25.783 --> 03:28.684
All right, now, uh, try rotating left.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.786
Mm-kay, here it goes.

03:30.822 --> 03:32.288

03:32.323 --> 03:34.256
Uh, no. Rotate the robot.

03:34.292 --> 03:35.257
With your joystick.

03:35.293 --> 03:36.358
Oh. Got it.

03:36.394 --> 03:37.493
Mm.

03:37.528 --> 03:39.261

kid didn't get injured.

03:39.297 --> 03:40.830
Um, we can hear you, Mr. Frond.

03:40.865 --> 03:42.998
Oh, um, good microphone.

03:43.034 --> 03:45.167
I know a guidance counselor
who's gonna get injured.

03:45.203 --> 03:46.602
Well, I can hear you.

03:46.637 --> 03:47.636
Guys, there are microphones.

03:47.672 --> 03:49.038
This is how they work.

03:49.073 --> 03:50.973
Tina, why don't you go ahead
and test that joystick,

03:51.008 --> 03:52.775
and we'll get you off to class.

03:52.810 --> 03:54.610
Ow! Damn it! Son of a bitch!

03:54.645 --> 03:55.544
Oh, sorry!

03:55.580 --> 03:56.879
It's fine.

03:56.914 --> 03:58.180
Uh, go ahead and try again.

03:58.216 --> 03:59.615
Ah! Ah! My leg!

03:59.650 --> 04:00.683
I'm pinned!

04:00.718 --> 04:01.684
Uh, sorry, um...

04:01.719 --> 04:02.518
Back up! Back up!

04:02.553 --> 04:03.853
Like this? Um...

04:03.888 --> 04:05.121
No! You're still going forward!

04:05.156 --> 04:07.356
So this is going pretty well.

04:08.493 --> 04:10.626
It feels kind of like
my first day of school.

04:10.661 --> 04:12.161
- How do I look?
- You look good.

04:12.196 --> 04:13.996
But I still kind of
wonder what else is on.

04:14.031 --> 04:16.499
You're too skinny.
Eat a battery or something.

04:16.534 --> 04:18.134
ZEKE: Whoa, there it is.

04:18.168 --> 04:19.567
Watch out, mankind.

04:19.603 --> 04:20.903
Ugh, Tina's a robot.

04:20.938 --> 04:22.671
Look at me, look at me, I'm a robot.

04:22.707 --> 04:24.240
Exactly,
that's exactly what she's doing.

04:24.275 --> 04:26.075
Hi, guys. Hi, Jimmy Junior.

04:26.110 --> 04:27.209
Uh, hi.

Hi, Tina.

04:28.513 --> 04:30.412
This thing is not Tina, Jocelyn.

04:30.448 --> 04:32.515
It's microchips and a
bunch of stupid wires.

04:32.550 --> 04:33.649
It's a clever lie!

04:33.684 --> 04:34.717
Sorry, not personal.

04:34.752 --> 04:36.519
I just don't care for bots.

04:36.554 --> 04:39.388
Well, guess I should roll along to class.
(chuckles nervously)

04:39.423 --> 04:41.123
Me, too. Uber me to Room Six?

04:41.192 --> 04:42.391
Room Ten for me.

05:14.125 --> 05:15.958
- So, still tuning?
- (plays single note)

05:15.993 --> 05:17.092
No, it's the song.

05:17.128 --> 05:18.093
That's the song?

05:18.129 --> 05:19.628
I mean, I think it's the song.

05:19.664 --> 05:22.198
It's just, there's a lot of
time in between the notes.

05:22.233 --> 05:23.799
I like it.

05:23.835 --> 05:25.467
I mean, it's not, like,
too much, you know?

05:25.503 --> 05:26.535
Like, too much song?

05:26.571 --> 05:27.536
No, it's not.

05:34.779 --> 05:36.378
Guess I missed it. Ah!

Cool locker.
Like what you've done to it.

07:36.136 --> 07:38.644
Like how trees are
really just giant plants.

07:38.679 --> 07:40.412
- Oh, yeah.
- (scoffs) Yeah.

07:40.447 --> 07:42.214
Uh-oh, that's my low-power warning.

07:42.249 --> 07:44.449
I want to keep talking,
but I'm at three percent battery.

07:44.485 --> 07:47.119
Wow, we missed fifth period.
We talked for hours.

07:47.154 --> 07:48.921
Yeah, we totally binge talked.

07:48.956 --> 07:50.622
Can, um... can I walk you home?

07:50.658 --> 07:52.057
Uh, the robot lives at school,

07:52.092 --> 07:53.959
but you can walk me to
the charging station.

07:53.994 --> 07:56.395
Ah! I'm at one percent!
Let's go! Move, move!

07:57.965 --> 07:59.731
Maybe being a robot isn't so bad.

07:59.767 --> 08:02.434
I just had my best conversation
ever with Jimmy Junior.

08:02.469 --> 08:04.603
And it's not like the
bar was set low at all.

08:04.638 --> 08:05.837
Did I tell you the thing about trees?

08:05.873 --> 08:07.339
Yeah, that they're like plants?

08:07.374 --> 08:08.974
- Giant plants.
- Yeah.

08:09.009 --> 08:10.842
Anyway, school's over,
and Gene and I were wondering

08:10.878 --> 08:13.145
if we could take the robot
out for a test drive.

08:13.180 --> 08:15.847
Don't worry, we'll keep it
under five miles per hour, Pops.

08:15.883 --> 08:18.517
Unless it goes over that.
Does it, perchance?

08:18.552 --> 08:20.285
Um, I'm really the only one

08:20.321 --> 08:21.587
that's supposed to use the robot.

08:21.622 --> 08:22.621
Sorry, guys.

08:22.656 --> 08:25.290
Tina, that is not a problem.

08:25.326 --> 08:27.092
We asked, you gave us an answer.

08:27.127 --> 08:28.594
We respect that.

08:28.629 --> 08:32.331
I kind of hate myself
for even asking Tina.

08:32.366 --> 08:34.032
(quietly): Wagstaff after dark.

08:34.068 --> 08:35.267
LOUISE: Okay, what should we do first?

08:35.302 --> 08:37.269
Bump things off Mr. Frond's desk?

08:37.304 --> 08:38.337
Do donuts in the library?

08:38.371 --> 08:39.705
GENE: See if Coach Blevins

08:39.740 --> 08:41.974
is really living under the
bleachers since his divorce?

08:42.009 --> 08:43.275
Well, we got all night.

08:43.309 --> 08:44.710
(Louise and Gene gasp)

08:44.745 --> 08:45.644
The security guard.

08:45.679 --> 08:46.878
- Huh?
- He's coming this way.

08:46.914 --> 08:47.879
What do we do?

08:48.949 --> 08:50.182
Whoa.

08:50.217 --> 08:52.384
(robotic voice): Hello,
human security guard.

08:52.419 --> 08:54.386
Any trouble in the halls tonight?

08:54.421 --> 08:56.688
Well, everything was pretty quiet

08:56.724 --> 08:58.824
till I saw you, robot gizmo thing.

08:58.859 --> 09:01.159
I think I better call this in.

09:01.195 --> 09:02.194
(robotic voice): Don't bother.

09:02.229 --> 09:03.795
I come from headquarters.

09:03.831 --> 09:05.897
I'm the cyber security guard.

09:05.966 --> 09:07.733
What's your name, bro?

09:07.768 --> 09:08.900
Yuli.

09:08.936 --> 09:10.335
Yuli, you seem great.

09:10.371 --> 09:14.172
But we cannot be friends,
because I am your supervisor.

09:14.208 --> 09:15.207
Wait, what?

09:15.242 --> 09:17.209
You mean, "Wait, what, sir?"

09:17.244 --> 09:18.710
Wait, what, sir? Wait, what, sir?

09:18.746 --> 09:20.145
- Sir, sir, sir.
- Sorry, I-I got it.

09:20.180 --> 09:21.680
I'm sorry. Sir, yes.

09:21.715 --> 09:23.649
Don't worry, I'm fun to work for.

09:23.684 --> 09:25.217
Oh, good. I'm fun to employ.

09:25.252 --> 09:26.318
This might work out.

09:26.353 --> 09:27.886
Now go to the cafeteria,

09:27.921 --> 09:29.421
grab three dozen peanut butter cookies

09:29.456 --> 09:31.690
and slide them through the
little slats in the door

09:31.725 --> 09:33.025
of locker 412.

09:33.060 --> 09:34.192
And 319.

09:34.228 --> 09:35.394
Eh, I don't think

09:35.429 --> 09:37.596
peanut butter cookies
will fit through there.

09:37.631 --> 09:38.764
Make them fit!

09:38.799 --> 09:40.365
Okay, okay. Geez!

09:43.203 --> 09:44.770
Seriously, Bob? In bed?

09:44.805 --> 09:46.571
So, not a banjo moment?

09:46.607 --> 09:48.240
Let me check. No.

09:48.275 --> 09:49.875
(chuckles) Good night.

09:49.910 --> 09:50.909
Night.

09:54.581 --> 09:55.781
Bob, I swear to God!

09:55.816 --> 09:57.382
I'm sorry, I thought you were asleep.

09:57.418 --> 09:58.517
I waited.

10:02.089 --> 10:03.722
- Bob.
- Yep.

10:05.259 --> 10:06.792
Tina-Bot, come into the AV closet.

10:06.827 --> 10:08.593
I-I want to show you something.

10:08.629 --> 10:11.596
It's something I haven't shown
anyone, not even Zeke.

10:11.632 --> 10:14.299
A secret and a "Zeke-ret"? Wow.

10:14.334 --> 10:16.635
Um, I've been working
on some poems, you know,

10:16.670 --> 10:19.471
about my life and kind of,
like, things I'm going through.

10:19.506 --> 10:21.707
Poems? Life? Going through? Yes.

10:21.742 --> 10:26.578
And I got this idea to put
poems and music together.

10:26.613 --> 10:28.280
Like... songs?

10:28.315 --> 10:29.881
No, "musoems."

10:29.917 --> 10:31.083
Oh, right.

10:31.118 --> 10:32.484
Here's the first one.

10:32.519 --> 10:34.286

10:34.321 --> 10:37.322

10:46.333 --> 10:48.567

10:50.804 --> 10:53.939

10:53.974 --> 10:55.807
That one's about breakfast.

10:55.843 --> 10:57.409

10:57.444 --> 11:02.314
♪ What if God's name was Todd? ♪

11:02.349 --> 11:05.150
So you, like, start a new one
before finishing... one?

11:05.185 --> 11:07.152
Uh... well, no.

11:07.187 --> 11:09.688
Like, three of the ones I
sang to you are finished.

11:09.723 --> 11:11.423
Like, the cars is finished.

11:11.458 --> 11:13.291
Lunch delivery. Tina, want some tuna?

11:13.327 --> 11:14.659
Can you knock?

11:14.695 --> 11:16.695
I'm in the AV closet with Jimmy Junior.

11:16.730 --> 11:18.463
What? What are you doing in the closet?

11:18.499 --> 11:19.698
We're having an intimate conversation

11:19.733 --> 11:21.433
and connecting deeply. God!

11:21.468 --> 11:23.001
Hi, Jimmy Junior.

11:23.036 --> 11:25.203
Uh, hi, Mrs. Belcher.

11:25.239 --> 11:27.105
(sniffs) Smells funny in here.
I think it's you.

11:27.141 --> 11:28.540
How long since you left the room?

11:28.575 --> 11:29.808
Mom, just go!

11:29.843 --> 11:31.510
All right, I'm going, I'm leaving.

11:31.545 --> 11:34.780

12:02.609 --> 12:04.910
Man, that bot's wrapped him
around her little wheels.

12:04.945 --> 12:07.245
You know,
she's probably using A.I. on him.

12:07.281 --> 12:09.314
Wait, A.I. like, "As if"?

12:09.349 --> 12:10.382
Yeah. As if.

12:10.417 --> 12:11.383
Oh, my God.

12:11.418 --> 12:12.417
I know.

12:12.452 --> 12:14.019
You two are making me feel smart.

12:16.523 --> 12:18.490
Tina, Jimmy Junior's at the door.

12:18.525 --> 12:19.724
She might be a sec.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.660
(panting)

12:21.695 --> 12:23.094
Hi, Jimmy Junior.

12:23.130 --> 12:25.230
You came down the stairs
like <i> The Exorcist.</i>

12:25.265 --> 12:27.732
Miss Jacobson wanted me to
give you this for homework.

12:27.768 --> 12:28.733
Oh, great.

12:28.769 --> 12:30.535
So, here it is.

12:30.571 --> 12:33.705
It's been a while since we've
seen each other in person.

12:33.740 --> 12:35.974
Yeah, it-it has.

12:36.009 --> 12:36.908
So...

12:37.044 --> 12:38.009
So...

12:38.045 --> 12:39.010
Any new "musoems"?

12:39.046 --> 12:40.078
I'm gonna go.

12:40.113 --> 12:41.713
Oh, okay. Good talk.

12:41.748 --> 12:42.747
Not really.

12:42.783 --> 12:43.949
I didn't see that.

12:43.984 --> 12:45.750
It was a little embarrassing,
but I didn't see it.

12:45.786 --> 12:46.751
God, Mom!

12:46.787 --> 12:47.752
Banjo? (strums banjo)

12:47.788 --> 12:49.087
- Dad, no.
- Bob, no.

12:49.122 --> 12:51.623
Okay. I'll check back in
at another time.

12:51.658 --> 12:54.893
That's odd. I should be
fully charged this morning,

12:54.928 --> 12:56.628
but I'm only at 20% power.

12:56.663 --> 12:58.230
(yawns) Weird.

12:58.265 --> 13:00.265
It's not like the robot is
running around all night,

13:00.300 --> 13:01.433
doing really fun stuff.

13:01.468 --> 13:02.434
Exactly.

13:02.469 --> 13:03.802
All right, who put

13:03.837 --> 13:06.304
20 basketballs in my supply closet?

13:06.340 --> 13:07.606
- (Louise laughs)
- Hey.

13:07.641 --> 13:08.940
Oh, hi, Jimmy Junior.

13:08.976 --> 13:11.309
Hey, did yesterday seem
awkward to you? 'Cause...

13:11.345 --> 13:14.045
Listen, I've decided I'm gonna
perform my "musoems"

13:14.081 --> 13:15.747
for everyone at the bonfire.

13:15.782 --> 13:18.216
But I need you there, as my date.

13:18.252 --> 13:19.985
Oh, wow. That-that's fantastic.

13:20.020 --> 13:21.319
I mean, my crutches might be

13:21.355 --> 13:22.754
a little tricky in the sand, but I...

13:22.789 --> 13:24.089
Your crutches?

13:24.124 --> 13:25.624
Yeah, those things
that go under my armpits.

13:25.659 --> 13:26.958
I call them "pit sticks."

13:26.994 --> 13:30.662
Wait, Jimmy Junior,
are you asking me or the robot?

13:30.697 --> 13:31.730
The robot.

13:31.765 --> 13:33.598
But I don't think of you as a robot.

13:33.634 --> 13:36.067
I think of you as almost a real person.

13:36.103 --> 13:37.335
So, what do you say?

13:37.371 --> 13:38.770
Um...

13:38.805 --> 13:40.305
Okay. It's a date.

13:40.340 --> 13:41.439
Great. Bye.

13:41.475 --> 13:43.441
Hey, that worked out.

13:43.477 --> 13:44.709
You're going to the bonfire.

13:44.745 --> 13:45.944
Uh, yeah, huh.

13:45.979 --> 13:48.280
I guess we're going
robot dress shopping.

13:48.315 --> 13:50.282
I've said that so many
times and it's finally true!

13:52.281 --> 13:54.948
So, Jimmy Junior doesn't like me as me.

13:55.051 --> 13:57.285
He likes me as a robot.
I can work with that.

13:57.320 --> 13:58.552
No relationship is perfect, right?

13:58.588 --> 14:00.054
Uh, a lot of girls have it worse.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.455
Yeah, look at mom.

14:01.491 --> 14:04.058
The important thing is
I'm going to the bonfire.

14:04.093 --> 14:07.061
It'll be my voice and my image
right there on the beach.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.530
Wait a minute.
How do I get the robot to the beach?

14:09.565 --> 14:11.385
It's not even supposed
to leave school. Oh, no!

14:11.708 --> 14:14.435
Tina, we know some people who
might be able to help you.

14:14.470 --> 14:15.870
(quietly): It's us.

14:15.905 --> 14:18.539
So, uh, where's the banjo?

14:18.574 --> 14:21.609
I'm thinking of taking it back
to the thrift store, actually.

14:21.644 --> 14:23.377
Oh, forget about making
that burger to-go.

14:23.413 --> 14:24.779
I will eat it here.

14:24.814 --> 14:26.380
Oh, God, I'm so relieved. (chuckles)

14:26.416 --> 14:27.615
I guess what I'm hearing is

14:27.650 --> 14:29.650
you're not gonna try
and talk me out of this.

14:29.686 --> 14:31.218
(laughs) Well, let's put it this way.

14:31.254 --> 14:33.054
People don't come to Bob's
Burgers for the music, you know?

14:33.089 --> 14:34.322
Yeah.

14:34.357 --> 14:36.290
It's called Bob's Burgers,
not Bob's Banjo.

14:36.326 --> 14:37.892
- Uh-huh.
- (laughs)

14:37.927 --> 14:40.428
It was more "grueling" banjo,
than "dueling" banjo. (laughs)

14:40.463 --> 14:41.896
All right, Teddy, you made your point.

14:41.931 --> 14:43.964
Geez, why you getting so hot?
You're terrible at the banjo.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.433
LINDA: <i>Big beach bonfire</i>

14:45.468 --> 14:47.468
- tonight, huh?
- Uh-huh.

14:47.503 --> 14:48.969
So, you're going, but you're not going,

14:49.005 --> 14:50.504
'cause you're staying here,

14:50.540 --> 14:52.306
but Jimmy Junior's going
and you're gonna do

14:52.342 --> 14:53.841
the thing with the robot?

14:53.876 --> 14:56.177
What part of "virtual robot date"
don't you understand?

14:56.212 --> 14:58.646
It just seems a little... unhealthy.

14:58.681 --> 15:00.281
Mom, I have a relationship now!

15:00.316 --> 15:01.849
A-And, yes, I've stopped
changing socks and underwear,

15:01.884 --> 15:03.417
and, yes, it smells funny in here.

15:03.453 --> 15:05.653
But, sweetie, this can't last.

15:05.688 --> 15:07.588
You got to step out
from behind the robot

15:07.623 --> 15:09.290
and go back to school next week.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.292
Unless you twist your
other ankle or something.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.095
Twist my other ankle. Interesting.

15:14.130 --> 15:16.263
Tina, do not twist your other ankle

15:16.299 --> 15:18.265
just to keep this
wackadoodle thing going.

15:18.301 --> 15:19.300
It's not wackadoodle!

15:19.335 --> 15:20.634
Now, excuse me,

15:20.670 --> 15:22.169
but I've got to check my battery level,

15:22.205 --> 15:23.170
stretch my joystick hand,

15:23.206 --> 15:24.605
and get dressed above the shoulders.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.774
Okay, okay, have fun.

15:26.809 --> 15:28.676
Be home by... Never mind.

15:28.711 --> 15:30.845
You're in good hands, T.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.780
Now, which way is the door?

15:32.815 --> 15:35.850
Hey, slow down there, R-Poo-D-Poo.

15:35.885 --> 15:37.118
A security guard!

15:37.153 --> 15:38.986
Don't worry. This guy's a pussycat.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.121
(robotic voice): How's it going,

15:40.156 --> 15:42.189
human security guard subordinate Yuli?

15:42.225 --> 15:45.493
I'm just popping out
for a smoke break. No biggie.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.862
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I talked to the office.

15:47.897 --> 15:51.232
There's no robot security
guard supervisor.

15:51.267 --> 15:53.467
You're a lying piece of sheet metal.

15:53.503 --> 15:54.802
- (gasps)
- Uh-oh.

15:54.837 --> 15:56.303
Okay, I lied.

15:56.339 --> 15:58.472
I'm not a robot security guard.

15:58.541 --> 15:59.507
Aha!

15:59.542 --> 16:01.242
Because I got laid off.

16:01.277 --> 16:02.810
They canceled the program.

16:02.845 --> 16:05.212
- Did you see <i> WALL-E?</i>
- No.

16:05.248 --> 16:08.849
Excellent. What I'm telling
you isn't that story at all.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.786
I'm a lonely robot
that's outlived its job.

16:11.854 --> 16:12.987
Oh, no.

16:13.022 --> 16:14.989
The company wants to recycle me,

16:15.024 --> 16:18.092
turn me into a bunch of smaller,
hotter robots.

16:18.127 --> 16:20.094
Maybe I should make a run for it,

16:20.129 --> 16:21.429
just get on the road

16:21.464 --> 16:24.031
and ride as far as my
charge will take me.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.500
Whoa. That's life stuff. That's huge.

16:26.536 --> 16:28.702
But how will I get out the front door?

16:28.738 --> 16:31.372
I will need someone to
open the front door.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.374
Hey, I could open the front door.

16:33.409 --> 16:35.209
- Yeah, right.
- No, really.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.445
I've got the key, I know the alarm code.

16:37.480 --> 16:39.346
Let me do this one thing for you.

16:39.382 --> 16:40.915
I'm totally lost here.

16:40.950 --> 16:41.916
What was that?

16:41.951 --> 16:43.617
(robotic voice): Nothing. Tina, shush!

16:43.653 --> 16:45.853
Safe travels, robot. Avoid Philly.

16:45.888 --> 16:47.188
Got it.

16:47.223 --> 16:48.656
I feel like I want to go with you.

16:48.691 --> 16:49.690
No.

16:49.725 --> 16:50.691
You need me.

16:50.726 --> 16:52.760
The school needs you. Stay here,

16:52.795 --> 16:54.762
guard this place against
prankster children.

16:54.797 --> 16:56.564
I have to do this on my own.

16:56.599 --> 16:57.631
Hey.

16:57.667 --> 16:59.066
Oh, my God, what?!

16:59.101 --> 17:00.067
Stay in touch.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.035
Do you have e-mail?

17:01.070 --> 17:02.970
I am e-mail.

17:06.113 --> 17:07.673
Tina-Bot, you made it.

17:07.708 --> 17:09.381
Sorry I'm late. A lot of sand.

17:09.416 --> 17:11.517
Also, I had a little trouble
with the volleyball net,

17:11.551 --> 17:12.851
but I won that battle.

17:12.887 --> 17:15.154
Great. Tina two-point-uch is here.

17:15.189 --> 17:16.989
So much for a night of kids bonding.

17:17.023 --> 17:18.324
Now it's just screen time.

17:18.358 --> 17:19.791
Hey, Tina-Bot, uh...

17:19.827 --> 17:22.194
the sign says,
"No motorized vehicles on beach."

17:22.229 --> 17:23.662
(laughs)

17:23.698 --> 17:26.699
Oh, my God, you <i> are</i> a motorized vehicle.

17:26.733 --> 17:29.068
It also says no trash
on the beach, Tammy.

17:29.103 --> 17:31.236
So... what are we gonna do here?

17:31.272 --> 17:33.739
(laughs) Oh, my God, it does say that.

17:33.774 --> 17:35.007
Shut it, Jocelyn.

17:35.042 --> 17:37.309
Whoa, what the hell
is the robot doing here?

17:37.345 --> 17:38.744
Did anyone approve this?

17:38.779 --> 17:41.413
I was told to do everything
a normal student would do.

17:41.449 --> 17:43.015
Well, stay out of the water.

17:43.050 --> 17:44.550
And stay away from the fire.

17:44.585 --> 17:46.685
And watch out for the sand.

17:46.721 --> 17:47.920
And try to have fun.

17:47.955 --> 17:49.188
What'd I miss?

17:49.223 --> 17:51.223
There's some dancing.
I guess I'm dancing.

17:51.258 --> 17:52.992
Is this dancing?

17:53.027 --> 17:55.728
Wow, look at Mr. Frond over there.
He can really shake it.

17:55.763 --> 17:58.063
Yep, everyone's having a great time,
including me.

17:58.099 --> 17:59.498
How's the bonfire going?

17:59.533 --> 18:01.533
Wow, Mr. Frond's a really good dancer.

18:01.569 --> 18:03.002
Oh, here comes Jimmy Junior.

18:03.037 --> 18:05.170
Okay, Tina. It's time.

18:05.206 --> 18:07.039
I'm gonna do my "musoems."

18:07.074 --> 18:11.343
I-I'm pretty nervous,
but I-I'm glad you're here.

18:11.379 --> 18:12.745
Oh, my God, he's coming in!

18:12.780 --> 18:13.645
(moaning)

18:15.416 --> 18:16.749
Oh.

18:16.784 --> 18:18.417
Oh, this is weird.

18:18.452 --> 18:20.052
But I can't not look.

18:20.087 --> 18:21.720
So long, childhood.

18:21.756 --> 18:24.323
This is the worst
episode of <i> The O.C.</i> ever.

18:24.358 --> 18:26.191
Tina, honey, you okay?

18:26.227 --> 18:27.960
You know, the same thing

18:27.995 --> 18:30.029
happened to me when I was your age.

18:30.064 --> 18:31.130
Really?

18:31.165 --> 18:32.731
No, sweetie, this is the first time

18:32.767 --> 18:34.099
this has happened to anyone.

18:34.135 --> 18:35.367
That's it!

18:35.403 --> 18:37.036
Hey, everyone.

18:37.071 --> 18:39.104

and we're all together.

18:39.140 --> 18:40.906
And, um...

18:40.941 --> 18:43.776
I've been writing some poems
and putting them to music.

18:43.811 --> 18:44.977
Oh, you mean like songs?

18:45.012 --> 18:46.178
No, they're called "musoems."

18:46.213 --> 18:47.279
I'm just gonna start.
