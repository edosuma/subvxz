00:33.455 --> 00:36.525
I think sex is overrated, Dr. Taylor.

00:36.625 --> 00:38.671
Don't you?

00:40.729 --> 00:44.641
No, I guess not.
You'd be out of a job, wouldn't you?

00:47.302 --> 00:51.908
I love that little scar on your mouth.

01:09.057 --> 01:11.726
My mother told me about sex.

01:11.826 --> 01:14.729
She said always try
to make it an act of love...

01:14.829 --> 01:17.299
and never force yourself on anyone.

01:17.399 --> 01:19.301
And I never have.

01:19.401 --> 01:22.370
The police do have an eyewitness
to the last killing.

01:22.470 --> 01:24.639
They say you were positively identified.

01:24.739 --> 01:28.776
Yeah, by a little teenage crack whore who
needed a fix and a new pair of glasses

01:28.876 --> 01:31.543
- to pick me in the lineup.
- How does that make you feel?

01:31.643 --> 01:34.724
I don't know why they're doing it.
I don't know why they're trying to frame me.

01:41.189 --> 01:44.793
How often would you say
you suffer from bouts of amnesia?

01:47.662 --> 01:49.207
I don't remember.

01:53.335 --> 01:54.736
Just kidding.

01:54.836 --> 01:57.505
I am here at the request of the court.

01:57.605 --> 02:02.552
My job is to evaluate whether or not
you are competent to stand trial.

02:07.849 --> 02:10.952
Tell me about these voices
that you hear.

02:11.051 --> 02:13.855
Do the voices come from
inside of your head...

02:13.955 --> 02:16.891
or do they come from
outside of your head?

02:16.991 --> 02:18.893
Outside.

02:18.993 --> 02:22.030
Sometimes I hear voices
coming from the TV...

02:22.130 --> 02:25.166
telling me to do things...

02:25.266 --> 02:27.636
all kinds of weird shit.

02:27.736 --> 02:29.804
- Interesting.
- Why?

02:29.904 --> 02:33.108
- Does it make a difference?
- A difference to what?

02:33.208 --> 02:37.879
If I have MPD...
Multiple Personality Disorder.

02:37.979 --> 02:39.814
That's part of it...

02:39.914 --> 02:43.689
But I'm really the one that's supposed
to be asking the questions, Max.

02:47.689 --> 02:51.635
You're a very attractive woman
for a shrink.

02:52.627 --> 02:53.865
Thank you.

02:57.165 --> 03:00.769
- We're out of time today.
- We're out of time?

03:00.869 --> 03:04.739
No, you're out of fuckin' time.
I'm not out of time.

03:04.839 --> 03:07.175
I got all the fuckin' time in the world.

03:07.275 --> 03:10.312
I don't think you realize the severity
of the charges they've got against me.

03:10.412 --> 03:14.460
They think I'm a monster and want to
strap me in that fucking electric chair.

03:23.258 --> 03:25.304
Good-bye, Max.

03:57.892 --> 04:02.597
You don't have to like it.
You just have to be impacted by it.

04:02.697 --> 04:05.367
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

04:05.467 --> 04:07.168
Wow.

04:07.268 --> 04:12.273
I spent all afternoon with a guy
who does this kind of shit for real.

04:12.373 --> 04:14.142
You should see the pictures
of his handiwork.

04:14.242 --> 04:16.444
He has pictures?
You should get him to sign 'em.

04:16.543 --> 04:18.589
He could make a fortune.

04:20.281 --> 04:23.752
You're probably right.
It's a sick world.

04:23.852 --> 04:26.364
You know, you really light up
when you're morbid.

04:28.323 --> 04:31.726
Come on. Here's the last pieces.

04:31.826 --> 04:34.596
See anything for over the hearth?

04:34.696 --> 04:38.500
It's just everything's entertainment.
That's the only value we recognize.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.301
- Isn't it?
- That's the truth.

04:40.401 --> 04:44.142
Bartender, another NyQuil
for my friend here.

04:55.016 --> 04:58.052
- You smell incredible.
- I'm not wearing anything.

04:58.152 --> 05:01.122
I wish. You know,
that's all there is to it, Sarah.

05:01.222 --> 05:05.126
- It all comes down to the smell.
- Speak for yourself.

05:05.226 --> 05:07.262
When you think about it,
that's really all we are.

05:07.362 --> 05:09.497
We're just animals with beepers.

05:09.597 --> 05:12.940
- Maybe it does all come down to smell.
- Yeah?

05:15.870 --> 05:18.973
And you smell like a friend,
who lives upstairs.

05:19.073 --> 05:22.844
Oh, yeah? I didn't smell like a friend
when you first moved into the building.

05:22.944 --> 05:25.480
That was one night, and I was drunk.

05:25.580 --> 05:29.284
Meaning that there is an easily achieved
state of reduced consciousness...

05:29.384 --> 05:31.986
that makes me devastatingly
attractive to you.

05:32.086 --> 05:34.389
Am I right?

05:34.489 --> 05:36.624
You just don't give up, do you?

05:36.724 --> 05:39.260
I'm Sisyphus with a hard-on.

05:39.360 --> 05:43.431
I mean, come on. It's been over a year
since that guy dumped you.

05:43.531 --> 05:46.634
Eleven months. And Benny didn't dump me.

05:46.734 --> 05:49.170
Whatever.
You have got to get over it now.

05:49.270 --> 05:50.939
No, I don't.

05:51.039 --> 05:55.009
The fact that I don't want a romantic
involvement now is not pathological.

05:55.109 --> 05:58.480
- It's my choice.
- Who said anything about involvement?

05:58.580 --> 06:01.058
I just wanna fuck.

06:05.553 --> 06:07.997
Good night, Cliff.

06:16.564 --> 06:19.033
- Hi, Maura.
- Morning, Dr. Taylor.

06:19.133 --> 06:22.180
Give me five minutes
before you put any calls through.

06:26.207 --> 06:28.443
The defendant is an only child.

06:28.543 --> 06:31.212
A cousin had
a psychiatric hospitalization.

06:31.312 --> 06:34.182
The defendant has no former
prior psychiatric history.

06:34.282 --> 06:37.385
However, he does exhibit signs
of Multiple Personality Disorder.

06:37.485 --> 06:41.089
He describes finding himself places
and having no idea how he got there.

06:41.189 --> 06:42.790
Yeah?

06:42.890 --> 06:45.293
Mr. Wabash is on his way to see you.

06:45.393 --> 06:46.928
Wabash?

06:47.028 --> 06:49.464
Yes. Max Cheski's attorney.

06:49.564 --> 06:53.568
Oh, right. Did he have an appointment?

06:53.668 --> 06:55.679
Yes. You spoke with him yesterday.

06:59.540 --> 07:01.483
Have a seat, Mr. Wabash.

07:04.045 --> 07:06.915
What can I do for you?

07:07.015 --> 07:08.950
My client thinks you don't like him.

07:09.050 --> 07:11.052
He's worried he's not
gonna get a fair shake.

07:11.152 --> 07:15.256
You can tell Mr. Cheski I'm gonna be
as fair as he has every right to expect.

07:15.356 --> 07:18.092
So what is going on here?

07:18.192 --> 07:22.964
- I'm entitled to disclosure.
- I haven't finished my evaluation.

07:23.064 --> 07:27.702
What's to evaluate? This guy's a total
schizo. We're talkin' Jekyll and Hyde.

07:27.802 --> 07:32.073
I think you're confusing schizophrenia
with Multiple Personality Disorder.

07:32.173 --> 07:36.110
- What are you saying?
- He could be a schizophrenic...

07:36.210 --> 07:38.046
or he could be suffering from MPD...

07:38.146 --> 07:41.916
but unless he's making psychiatric
history, he can't be both.

07:42.016 --> 07:44.886
What you're saying is that he's faking
this in order to beat the rap.

07:44.986 --> 07:47.555
Isn't that what you're really saying?

07:47.655 --> 07:51.168
I'm suspending judgment
pending further evaluation.

07:55.830 --> 07:58.132
Dr. Taylor, let me be
absolutely frank with you.

07:58.232 --> 08:02.637
I think that as a woman,
you may be prejudiced against my client.

08:02.737 --> 08:06.774
I think you may have certain
personal issues regarding rape.

08:06.874 --> 08:10.547
Like you might have, say,
personal issues regarding castration?

08:36.738 --> 08:39.573
- Oh.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

08:39.674 --> 08:41.109
No, I'm sorry.

08:41.208 --> 08:42.947
- Go ahead.
- After you.

08:47.515 --> 08:50.318
- No.
- Excuse me?

08:50.418 --> 08:54.355
Bad choice.
They don't make a good Cabernet.

08:54.455 --> 08:58.332
- They make a good Pinot Noir.
- A good domestic Pinot Noir?

08:59.293 --> 09:02.664
No. That's a contradiction in terms.

09:02.764 --> 09:05.845
- Ever had Calera?
- Ever had La Tache?

09:10.304 --> 09:13.841
Would you like to?

09:13.941 --> 09:16.611
Thank you.

09:16.711 --> 09:19.621
- You don't know what you're missing.
- I don't know you.

09:21.315 --> 09:24.919
My name is Tony. Tony Ramirez.

09:25.019 --> 09:27.622
Mr. Ramirez, we're strangers...

09:27.722 --> 09:30.291
and I was raised
to never talk to strangers.

09:30.391 --> 09:34.595
You never talk to strangers,
you'll never make any friends.

09:34.695 --> 09:36.741
You live in the neighborhood?

09:41.836 --> 09:44.639
Is this a coincidence or what?

09:44.739 --> 09:48.476
Remember me?
We met in the wine section. Tony.

09:48.576 --> 09:52.313
- Tony Ramirez.
- The burgundy snob. How could I forget?

09:52.413 --> 09:54.248
I don't usually do this.

09:54.348 --> 09:57.118
But I just moved here,
and I don't know a soul.

09:57.218 --> 09:59.025
- From where?
- From Puerto Rico.

10:02.657 --> 10:05.960
I guess I am a little overanxious
to make some friends.

10:06.060 --> 10:09.164
Oh, really? Well,
you see that woman over there?

10:10.298 --> 10:12.002
Why don't you make friends with her?

10:13.534 --> 10:16.771
Because... Okay. I admit it.

10:16.871 --> 10:19.679
I find you incredibly attractive.

10:21.309 --> 10:24.145
But if you think I am bothering you...

10:24.245 --> 10:26.781
if you think I am totally out of line...

10:26.881 --> 10:30.087
you just tell me, and I am gone.

10:35.823 --> 10:38.459
This is it... your last chance...

10:38.559 --> 10:41.696
before we run into each other
in the parking lot.

10:41.796 --> 10:43.297
What year?

10:43.397 --> 10:46.300
Well, I was kind of hoping
for this year.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.036
- Maybe even tonight.
- I was talking about the La Tache.

10:49.136 --> 10:52.046
Oh. '61.

10:53.708 --> 10:57.145
Do I look like someone
who can be bought with a good vintage?

10:57.245 --> 11:02.727
You look like someone who has to be won.

11:27.241 --> 11:28.786
Taxi!

11:35.850 --> 11:37.896
Hi, lady.

11:49.864 --> 11:52.466
What do you say? Say yes.

11:52.566 --> 11:54.907
Say, "Yes!"

12:09.483 --> 12:11.563
Here's my number. Call me.

12:21.028 --> 12:24.899
You wanna go now, lady?

12:24.999 --> 12:26.635
I think so.

12:38.479 --> 12:41.015
Jesus Christ.
You almost gave me a heart attack.

12:41.115 --> 12:44.385
I'm sorry. I've been callin' all day.

12:44.485 --> 12:46.787
Kept gettin' the damn machine.

12:46.887 --> 12:48.989
Aren't you gonna give your father a hug?

12:58.232 --> 13:00.278
You okay?

13:02.837 --> 13:07.317
Yeah. I just gotta clean this mess up
before the neighbors complain.

13:18.219 --> 13:20.121
So, how long have you been in town?

13:20.221 --> 13:22.423
I just came in this afternoon.

13:22.523 --> 13:24.725
I'm only gonna stay one night.

13:24.825 --> 13:28.134
Got a few customers to see tomorrow.
Then I'm gone.

13:31.732 --> 13:34.735
I'm sorry. It's not a very good time.

13:34.835 --> 13:38.306
I've gotta go out,
and I've gotta get ready.

13:38.406 --> 13:41.108
Aren't you gonna even offer me a drink?

13:41.208 --> 13:43.344
I don't have any liquor in the house.

13:43.444 --> 13:45.820
Had I known you were coming...

13:49.517 --> 13:54.066
You were such a sweet little girl.
So pretty.

13:58.192 --> 14:02.638
I was hopin' to stay on the couch tonight.
Every dollar counts right now.

14:04.832 --> 14:07.969
I'm sorry, Henry. This isn't convenient.

14:08.069 --> 14:13.708
Not convenient? This is some family.
Why not try calling me "Dad"?

14:13.808 --> 14:16.844
I don't think you're being very reasonable.
You show up out of the blue.

14:16.944 --> 14:19.814
I haven't seen you
in I don't know how long.

14:19.914 --> 14:22.283
What am I supposed to do?
Just drop everything?

14:22.383 --> 14:24.929
You don't seem pleased to see me.

14:30.157 --> 14:32.203
I'm a sick man, angel.

14:33.227 --> 14:35.273
And I'm not gonna be around forever.

14:38.933 --> 14:40.910
I am pleased to see you.

14:50.778 --> 14:52.713
Do you have plans for Christmas?

14:52.813 --> 14:55.816
Maybe I could do it here...
cook a turkey.

14:55.916 --> 14:57.495
Don't put yourself out.

15:02.389 --> 15:04.859
Here.

15:04.959 --> 15:07.630
At least I can pay for your motel.

15:08.429 --> 15:10.008
You don't have to do that.

15:16.003 --> 15:18.310
Call me. We'll make a plan.

15:19.406 --> 15:21.452
Bye, angel.

15:36.657 --> 15:38.592
- I need some vodka.
- I don't have any.

15:38.692 --> 15:40.795
- Sure you do. Come on.
- No, I don't.

15:40.895 --> 15:43.264
- I saw some in the...
- Hi.

15:43.364 --> 15:45.866
- Hi.
- Are you coming, Cliff?

15:45.966 --> 15:49.070
- I'll be right there.
- I don't have any vodka.

15:49.170 --> 15:51.072
- I hate vodka.
- Well, she loves vodka.

15:51.172 --> 15:54.008
Good. Is she even old enough to drink?

15:54.108 --> 15:57.178
- What do you guys talk about?
- Who said we talk about anything?

15:57.278 --> 15:59.847
There are other ways
for a man and a woman to relate.

15:59.947 --> 16:02.152
Right. You can just smell each other.

16:07.421 --> 16:09.223
Somebody must have given it to me.

16:09.323 --> 16:11.403
Who would that be, like, Yeltsin?

16:12.793 --> 16:15.897
Anyway, thank you for not having it.
You saved my life.

16:17.631 --> 16:19.768
Hello. Oh, hi.

16:22.203 --> 16:26.307
Of course I remember. La Tache, '61...

16:26.407 --> 16:28.453
a memorable year.

16:32.246 --> 16:34.292
That would be nice.

16:41.755 --> 16:43.801
Tony? Who's Tony?

16:48.529 --> 16:51.007
What do you mean,
don't let the elevator scare me?

16:52.466 --> 16:54.568
Okay. Top floor, 63.

16:55.536 --> 16:58.005
Great. Okay.

16:58.105 --> 17:01.475
I'll see you tomorrow night. Bye.

17:01.575 --> 17:04.878
Now what is that? You have a date?

17:04.979 --> 17:06.480
I have a wine-tasting.

17:06.579 --> 17:09.819
- Well, how many people?
- Two.

17:50.958 --> 17:53.834
La Tache, '61.

18:29.630 --> 18:32.433
- You're a bad influence.
- How bad?

18:32.533 --> 18:37.771
Well, here I am,
getting drunk with a stranger.

18:37.871 --> 18:41.041
- A stranger, huh?
- You know what I mean.

18:41.141 --> 18:43.721
You need more wine.

18:48.349 --> 18:51.051
And you never heard from him again?

18:51.151 --> 18:55.122
Not a word. One minute
I was engaged to be married to Benny...

18:55.222 --> 18:57.758
and the next, he was gone.

18:57.858 --> 19:01.295
You mean he split? He ran out on you?

19:01.395 --> 19:03.964
He didn't leave a note. Nothing.

19:04.064 --> 19:06.201
What a shit, huh?

19:09.837 --> 19:14.508
So what exactly does
a surveillance consultant do?

19:14.608 --> 19:17.411
- Kind of what it sounds like.
- A bodyguard?

19:17.511 --> 19:20.182
Yeah. That's how I started.

19:21.782 --> 19:24.021
Now I sell security devices...

19:25.586 --> 19:29.490
alarm systems, car alarms,
motion sensors.

19:29.590 --> 19:33.228
I suppose my job's about
making people feel safe.

19:35.295 --> 19:39.969
- You're good at it.
- You think?

19:41.101 --> 19:44.305
I have a feeling nothing bad
can happen when you're around.

19:44.405 --> 19:49.147
I like that. Thank you.

19:53.847 --> 19:57.952
- Is New York your hometown?
- No. I'm from Albany.

19:58.919 --> 20:01.655
That was way back.

20:01.755 --> 20:07.203
My mother was killed when I was five,
and we moved away.

20:08.796 --> 20:11.332
Killed?

20:11.432 --> 20:13.478
Yeah. A car crash.

20:14.568 --> 20:16.614
I'm sorry.

20:18.472 --> 20:21.314
I don't really remember
anything about it.

20:23.277 --> 20:26.324
I was raised by my aunt in New York.

20:30.651 --> 20:32.958
What about your father?

20:35.589 --> 20:38.425
He was always away.
He's a traveling salesman.

20:38.525 --> 20:41.695
- He was always on the road.
- Must have been lonely.

20:41.795 --> 20:43.841
I guess.

20:45.866 --> 20:48.369
Never knew any different.

20:48.469 --> 20:51.004
The only memory I have of my mother...

20:51.104 --> 20:53.650
is of her reading to me at night.

20:57.244 --> 21:00.347
She used to climb
right into bed with me.

21:00.447 --> 21:03.027
I remember her.

21:04.451 --> 21:06.497
I really miss her.

21:12.426 --> 21:14.461
I'm sorry. I'm being ridiculous.

21:14.561 --> 21:17.731
- It suits you.
- Being ridiculous?

21:17.831 --> 21:22.209
Being not so in control.

23:25.292 --> 23:27.728
You look different today.

23:27.828 --> 23:31.899
What is it? Your sex life pick up?

23:35.469 --> 23:38.205
Good morning, Max.

23:38.305 --> 23:40.140
I didn't think I'd see you again.

23:40.240 --> 23:42.309
I thought you'd made up
your mind about me.

23:42.409 --> 23:45.679
- Why did you think that?
- Because you're very judgmental...

23:45.779 --> 23:47.681
for a psychologist.

23:47.781 --> 23:49.683
Is that why your attorney
came to see me?

23:49.783 --> 23:51.585
He's a fucking idiot.

23:51.685 --> 23:54.888
- I told him it wouldn't work.
- Wouldn't work?

23:54.988 --> 23:58.892
I told him you weren't the kind
of person to be intimidated.

23:58.992 --> 24:01.328
- You were right.
- Good.

24:01.428 --> 24:03.430
You've got principles. I like that.

24:03.530 --> 24:06.668
If we had more like you,
this world would be a better place.

24:08.201 --> 24:10.270
Max, I wanna ask you
a little bit more...

24:10.370 --> 24:12.677
about these voices
that you say you hear.

24:14.541 --> 24:19.386
That I say I hear. See? You're being
judgmental, and you don't even know it.

24:20.414 --> 24:23.050
And that's not good, Sarah.
It's not fair!

24:23.150 --> 24:26.386
You're absolutely right. I'm sorry.

24:26.486 --> 24:29.623
- Let me rephrase the question.
- You do that.

24:29.723 --> 24:33.026
But I'm still gonna know
that you're not on my side.

24:33.126 --> 24:36.163
- I'm not on anybody's side.
- Oh, no, Sarah.

24:36.263 --> 24:40.311
If you're not for me, you're against me.

24:56.750 --> 25:01.321
Hi, Sarah. Just thought I'd call, so...

25:01.421 --> 25:03.390
I can't wait to see you tonight...

25:03.490 --> 25:05.826
so I'll pick you up at 7:00, okay?

25:05.926 --> 25:09.496
Oh, it's Tony, by the way. Bye.

26:50.230 --> 26:51.865
Yes!

26:51.965 --> 26:53.738
Son of a bitch.

26:55.001 --> 26:56.236
I'm impressed.

26:56.336 --> 26:59.573
- You get your pick.
- What do you want?

26:59.673 --> 27:02.776
- I don't care.
- She'll take the tiger.

27:02.876 --> 27:06.014
No, not that. The giraffe.

27:06.813 --> 27:09.282
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

27:09.382 --> 27:13.019
- So cute.
- I really figured you for the tiger.

27:13.119 --> 27:15.199
Good thing I am not a shrink.

27:16.857 --> 27:19.126
One on the nose! Win a stuffed animal!

27:19.226 --> 27:22.496
- Where'd you learn to shoot?
- Three shots for a buck!

27:22.596 --> 27:24.965
What about you, buddy?

27:25.065 --> 27:27.111
I was a cop.

27:28.969 --> 27:31.271
- What?
- I was a cop.

27:31.371 --> 27:35.146
- Three shots for a buck!
- In Puerto Rico.

27:36.610 --> 27:39.479
Really? That's surprising.

27:39.579 --> 27:41.882
- Who's next? Try your luck?
- Why did you quit?

27:41.982 --> 27:44.084
Three shots for a buck. On the nose.

27:45.819 --> 27:47.754
The hours.

27:47.854 --> 27:51.992
- How about another try?
- What about you shoot the rest?

27:52.092 --> 27:54.594
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

27:54.694 --> 27:57.030
No. I hate guns.

27:57.130 --> 28:00.433
It's just a try. Come on.
Just try. For fun.

28:00.533 --> 28:03.170
- Go for it. Come on.
- It's not really fun.

28:03.270 --> 28:05.605
Yeah. It is. Come on.

28:05.705 --> 28:08.809
All right. No, it's okay. Do it again.

28:08.909 --> 28:11.945
You need to get both sights lined up.

28:12.045 --> 28:13.920
This goes here.

28:16.116 --> 28:19.254
Now kill the clown.

28:19.986 --> 28:22.464
Go for it. Come on.

28:24.257 --> 28:26.963
Come on, Sarah. Yeah!

28:30.997 --> 28:34.034
It's all right. What's wrong?

28:34.134 --> 28:36.603
Do you want a doctor?

28:36.703 --> 28:39.807
- Can you stand up?
- I don't know.

28:40.907 --> 28:42.953
All right. Come here.

28:46.646 --> 28:50.584
It's all right.
I'm going to let you here.

28:50.684 --> 28:53.053
- Okay.
- All right. Yeah.

28:53.153 --> 28:55.199
Just a second.

29:01.828 --> 29:04.374
Okay. It's all right. Let's go.

29:44.270 --> 29:48.546
Hey. I made you some camomile tea.

29:50.510 --> 29:54.114
- A cop who makes camomile tea.
- That's me.

29:57.417 --> 29:59.619
Tony, did you send me flowers?

29:59.719 --> 30:01.264
Flowers.

30:02.722 --> 30:05.928
No. Was I supposed to?

30:11.831 --> 30:13.500
Yeah.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.145
Yes.

30:19.005 --> 30:21.051
Wish I had.

30:23.743 --> 30:26.289
Must be another admirer.

30:32.285 --> 30:34.524
I think I should go now.

30:36.756 --> 30:40.827
Sarah, is this a nice way of dumping me?

30:40.927 --> 30:44.331
- I just think we should slow down.
- You mean stop?

30:44.431 --> 30:46.766
I mean it...

30:46.866 --> 30:49.970
It's hard for me to trust people.

30:53.773 --> 30:55.648
Me too.

30:57.944 --> 31:01.081
- So I'm gonna go.
- Wanna go?

31:01.181 --> 31:02.849
Fine.

31:02.949 --> 31:05.859
Go. Be my guest.

31:08.321 --> 31:11.024
But I don't understand
what the fuck is going on.

31:11.124 --> 31:13.893
- Don't talk to me like that.
- I can't make you out.

31:13.993 --> 31:17.630
One minute, you're all over me.
The next, you're pushing me out.

31:17.730 --> 31:19.766
- I was never all over you!
- Well, it seemed that way to me!

31:19.866 --> 31:21.868
- Oh, fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

31:21.968 --> 31:23.970
Hey! Wait!

31:24.070 --> 31:26.844
You forgot something.

33:10.410 --> 33:12.615
What else?

34:45.804 --> 34:47.407
That's how I like my men.

34:47.507 --> 34:49.882
- Yeah?
- Wet...

34:51.344 --> 34:53.389
and naked.

35:08.528 --> 35:09.902
Come here.

37:03.609 --> 37:05.689
Come on, Sandy.

37:29.635 --> 37:32.405
- Maura?
- Yes, Dr. Taylor.

37:32.505 --> 37:34.907
Do you know anything
about this hand-delivered note?

37:35.007 --> 37:37.883
It was in with all your other mail.

37:56.496 --> 37:59.198
Winter storms blanketed
parts of the Northeast yesterday...

37:59.298 --> 38:01.901
resulting in highway closures
in several states...

38:02.001 --> 38:03.703
along the eastern seaboard.

38:03.803 --> 38:06.973
Road crews worked through the night
in many parts of the region...

38:07.073 --> 38:09.909
Come on, Sarina.

38:10.009 --> 38:12.245
That's right.

38:12.345 --> 38:14.547
- There you go.
- Following one of our top stories...

38:14.647 --> 38:19.185
accused serial killer Max Cheski
remains incarcerated awaiting trial...

38:19.285 --> 38:23.222
whole the defense maintains
he is not guilty by reason of insanity.

38:23.322 --> 38:28.361
And yesterday, the prosecution's
only witness OD'd on crack cocaine.

38:28.461 --> 38:31.474
After the break, we'll learn
about what one group of schoolchildren...

38:35.268 --> 38:38.315
Such good practice for you, darling.

39:35.661 --> 39:39.565
What do you know about this, Wabash?
I will not tolerate harassment.

39:39.665 --> 39:42.335
- Harassment?
- I've had dead flowers at my doorstep...

39:42.435 --> 39:44.947
my own obituary placed in the newspaper.

39:46.872 --> 39:49.642
So it's my client?

39:49.742 --> 39:52.879
The last time I saw Cheski, he said,
"If you're not for me, you're against me."

39:52.979 --> 39:56.716
He's in jail, okay?
Maximum security, for Christ's sake.

39:56.816 --> 39:59.585
Tell me he doesn't have
any friends on the outside.

39:59.685 --> 40:02.622
I talk to this guy every day. If he was
trying to pull a stunt like this...

40:02.722 --> 40:05.024
How would he even know?

40:05.124 --> 40:07.793
If he really is suffering
from Multiple Personality Disorder...

40:07.893 --> 40:10.997
one personality has no idea
what the others are even doing.

40:13.432 --> 40:17.937
Are you really suggesting that Max is
doing things he doesn't even know about?

40:18.037 --> 40:20.506
- That's ridiculous.
- Ridiculous?

40:20.606 --> 40:22.913
It's the whole basis
for you defense, isn't it?

40:31.150 --> 40:35.054
This is supposed to be blackened shrimp.
I don't know, Sarina.

40:35.154 --> 40:38.599
What do you think, little kitty?
Yeah, little kitty.

40:39.992 --> 40:44.040
You should do something about the heater
in the bathroom. You got a screwdriver?

40:50.202 --> 40:53.010
I take it! Oh, boy.

40:57.910 --> 41:00.880
Being with you, creating a meal...

41:00.980 --> 41:04.450
- Burning down an apartment.
- All of it.

41:04.550 --> 41:07.256
There's no place I'd rather be.

41:15.127 --> 41:17.730
Maybe we should just get takeout.

41:17.830 --> 41:19.876
Why don't we just go out?

41:31.944 --> 41:33.489
Hello?

41:35.581 --> 41:38.127
- Oh, hi, Henry.
- Jesus.

41:39.618 --> 41:43.489
Tony, it's stuck.
You just have to push it.

41:43.589 --> 41:45.391
What?

41:45.491 --> 41:48.294
I don't feel comfortable
calling you "Dad." I told you that.

41:48.394 --> 41:50.440
I just gotta get this.

41:55.668 --> 41:58.504
Christmas? I haven't
really thought about it.

41:58.604 --> 42:02.208
No. I'm not changing my mind. Look,
this just isn't a really good time.

42:02.308 --> 42:04.877
Can I... Can I call you back?

42:04.977 --> 42:06.779
Got company. Yeah. A friend.

42:06.879 --> 42:09.181
Why don't you just call me
closer to Christmas?

42:09.281 --> 42:12.328
I'll talk to you soon. Bye, Henry.

42:18.124 --> 42:20.192
- Why don't I help you out?
- What?

42:20.292 --> 42:22.372
With the dinner. Christmas.

42:24.196 --> 42:27.633
That's sweet of you, Tony,
but you don't want to do that.

42:27.733 --> 42:31.440
- I'd love to meet your father.
- No, you wouldn't. He's a fuckin' pig.

42:33.773 --> 42:37.184
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

42:37.977 --> 42:40.212
He just...

42:40.312 --> 42:42.882
He just suddenly wants a part of me
after all this time.

42:42.982 --> 42:45.317
He wasn't there for years
when I was growing up.

42:45.417 --> 42:48.623
Your boyfriend? The shit?

42:53.459 --> 42:56.662
Yeah, that's Benny.

42:56.762 --> 42:59.274
I don't know why I still have that up.

43:00.232 --> 43:02.278
Nice car.

43:04.103 --> 43:06.072
- Why do you think...
- What?

43:06.172 --> 43:08.507
Why did you keep the photo?

43:08.607 --> 43:12.745
Jesus, Tony, would you just
let it drop, please?

43:12.845 --> 43:16.982
- Why do you have to push so hard?
- Do I?

43:17.082 --> 43:19.051
It's like you want to know
everything about me.

43:19.151 --> 43:24.098
- And what do I know about you?
- Nothing.

43:43.843 --> 43:46.685
Hey, stop. Say hi to us here, huh?

44:00.960 --> 44:03.129
How do you feel about the person...

44:03.229 --> 44:05.131
who killed and mutilated these women?

44:05.231 --> 44:09.609
Must be sick... very, very sick.

44:10.569 --> 44:14.617
Somebody that can't tell the difference
between right and wrong.

44:15.841 --> 44:18.744
- Can you tell the difference?
- Can I?

44:18.844 --> 44:23.149
Half the world can't.
It's a western concept.

44:23.249 --> 44:25.852
The Buddhists have a saying:

44:26.952 --> 44:30.625
If you meet your master
on the road, kill him.

44:31.423 --> 44:32.792
What does that mean?

44:32.892 --> 44:37.566
It means I don't have any fucking
masters. That's what it means.

44:44.003 --> 44:46.049
- Good-bye, Max.
- Bye.

45:04.590 --> 45:08.137
- Oh, hi, Doris.
- Hang on a sec. I got a parcel for ya.

45:14.900 --> 45:17.937
- It was outside the front door.
- Did you see who left it?

45:18.037 --> 45:21.550
No. I got home from work,
and it was just sittin' there.

45:22.441 --> 45:23.986
Thanks.

46:08.787 --> 46:10.560
Oh, my God!

46:15.527 --> 46:17.663
You should consider hirin'
a private detective.

46:17.763 --> 46:21.467
This is exactly the kind of case
where they can often do more.

46:21.567 --> 46:24.970
- But like what?
- It's usually someone you know...

46:25.070 --> 46:28.440
a friend, a co-worker,
maybe even a boyfriend.

46:28.540 --> 46:31.710
And often, all it takes
is a strong warning to back 'em off.

46:31.810 --> 46:34.079
Excuse me. Why don't you wanna help me?

46:34.179 --> 46:38.183
Look. Take my advice
and hire a private detective.

46:38.283 --> 46:42.988
I'm gonna give you a name. Go home,
get some rest and think it over.

46:43.088 --> 46:45.758
I'm afraid to go home.
Do you know what that's like?

46:45.858 --> 46:48.761
- I'm sure it's terrible.
- No, you don't.

46:48.861 --> 46:52.636
- Yes. Detective Spatz.
- You don't have a fucking clue!

46:54.266 --> 46:56.778
Excuse me!

48:03.769 --> 48:05.815
It's me.

48:07.339 --> 48:09.775
Tony, it's really a bad time right now.

48:09.875 --> 48:13.650
- Can I call you later?
- No. I'm coming up.

48:44.810 --> 48:48.050
- What's going on?
- You don't know?

48:49.181 --> 48:51.921
- Know what?
- Somebody killed my cat.

48:53.085 --> 48:55.054
- I'm sorry. I'm so...
- Don't.

48:55.154 --> 48:56.622
- What?
- Don't touch me.

48:56.722 --> 48:59.325
What is it? Hey.

49:01.860 --> 49:05.264
Where were you last night? I needed you.

49:05.364 --> 49:09.535
I was out of town.
I went to Boston. You know that.

49:09.635 --> 49:12.204
- No, I don't. Why?
- Yeah, I told you I was going.

49:12.304 --> 49:14.714
- No, you didn't.
- What's goin' on?

49:16.408 --> 49:19.311
- Who's he?
- He's Cliff.

49:19.411 --> 49:22.748
- Oh, you're Cliff.
- Yeah, I'm "Clafe."

49:22.848 --> 49:25.918
She said it's a bad time, pal.
Don't you listen?

49:26.018 --> 49:29.588
- What is this clown doing here?
- He's taking care of me.

49:29.688 --> 49:32.291
- He's being a friend.
- Yeah?

49:33.759 --> 49:36.028
- A real close friend.
- Yeah. I am.

49:36.128 --> 49:38.030
Let's get somethin' straight, okay?

49:38.130 --> 49:41.300
Ever since you came
into Sarah's life, you...

49:41.400 --> 49:43.936
- Don't do that.
- Don't do what? Don't touch you?

49:44.036 --> 49:47.272
- Yeah. Don't touch me.
- Ever since you came into her life...

49:47.372 --> 49:49.418
a lot of bad things have been happening.

49:58.817 --> 50:01.158
Are you out of your mind?

50:02.921 --> 50:05.691
- Just get out of my house.
- The guy was out of line.

50:05.791 --> 50:07.693
- He was out of line?
- I know you're upset...

50:07.793 --> 50:10.462
- Yes! Somebody's killed my cat!
- I'm sorry!

50:10.562 --> 50:13.108
Don't yell at me!

50:16.768 --> 50:18.814
You think it's me, don't you?

50:21.406 --> 50:23.179
You think I killed your cat.

50:24.676 --> 50:27.382
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

50:30.182 --> 50:31.850
I feel awful.

50:31.950 --> 50:34.753
So do I.

50:34.853 --> 50:37.122
I'm sorry.

50:37.222 --> 50:39.461
I wish I could...

50:40.559 --> 50:43.299
I wish you could trust me.

51:14.660 --> 51:19.264
This guy Tony...
How long have you been dating him?

51:19.364 --> 51:23.235
About a month, but I'm telling you
I do not think it's him.

51:23.335 --> 51:26.672
I'm not saying it is, but we should
begin by eliminating him from the list.

51:26.772 --> 51:30.876
- This is just so crazy.
- Well, suspicion is an ugly thing.

51:30.976 --> 51:33.682
But then, so is what's happening to you.

51:34.646 --> 51:36.782
Dating in the '90s.

51:36.882 --> 51:38.928
Glad I'm out of it.

51:44.523 --> 51:46.102
I'll need $2,000.

51:48.193 --> 51:50.068
As a retainer.

51:51.096 --> 51:53.165
I think I'm falling in love
with somebody...

51:53.265 --> 51:56.608
but meanwhile I gotta check first
to make sure he's not a psychopath.

52:10.082 --> 52:13.652
- Well, you're a natural.
- What? What did you say?

52:13.752 --> 52:17.256
I said you're a natural.
I'm glad you're on my side...

52:17.356 --> 52:20.562
if you still are.

52:23.195 --> 52:25.364
I don't know what to say
about the other night.

52:25.464 --> 52:29.171
- You don't have to say anything.
- I'm sorry.

52:33.739 --> 52:35.807
Let's do one more.

52:35.907 --> 52:38.749
I thought you were terrified of guns.

52:40.278 --> 52:42.324
I got over it.

52:46.885 --> 52:49.588
So, you are the doctor. Tell me.

52:49.688 --> 52:51.734
How do we learn to trust?

52:58.497 --> 53:02.367
How do we learn to trust?
That's a good question.

53:02.467 --> 53:05.137
There was this group exercise
we used to have...

53:05.237 --> 53:09.007
Where patients took turns
falling backwards, catching each other.

53:09.107 --> 53:12.188
- Let's do it.
- No. I don't wanna do it.

53:13.445 --> 53:16.648
- I'm gonna fall. You catch me!
- Tony, you're too big.

53:16.748 --> 53:19.454
Come on. You're stronger than you think.
I'm falling?

53:23.488 --> 53:26.525
I caught you!
I can't believe I caught you!

53:26.625 --> 53:28.660
- Your turn.
- You trusted me!

53:28.760 --> 53:31.568
- No.
- I'm right here.

53:35.367 --> 53:37.879
- I don't want to.
- Yes, you do.

53:42.240 --> 53:43.785
I'm scared.

53:44.609 --> 53:46.345
Me too.

53:46.445 --> 53:48.491
But that's not gonna stop me.

56:25.804 --> 56:29.007
Do you really
have to go to Boston tomorrow?

56:29.107 --> 56:33.314
I do, but I don't like leaving you
even for a day.

56:35.680 --> 56:39.050
Tony, is that true?

56:39.150 --> 56:41.196
I love you, Sarah.

56:42.554 --> 56:44.429
I love you, Tony.

57:26.297 --> 57:28.673
Your father on line two.

57:30.835 --> 57:34.072
- Tell him I'm in a meeting.
- It's the third time he's called.

57:34.172 --> 57:35.927
Just tell him I'm in a meeting.

57:36.027 --> 57:39.101
Excuse me. Excuse me.  Excuse me.

57:46.985 --> 57:49.031
- Excuse me, sir.
- Watch it?

58:01.199 --> 58:04.970
Dr. Taylor? Did Tony say
anything about taking a trip?

58:05.070 --> 58:08.607
Yeah, he's going to Boston
to do some business.

58:08.707 --> 58:10.609
He may have a drinking problem.

58:10.709 --> 58:16.020
His MasterCard shows that he dropped
700 bucks at a liquor store in one shot.

58:20.118 --> 58:22.357
Listen, I gotta go.
I gotta check in. Bye.

58:25.090 --> 58:28.535
Flight 47 to Boston
now boarding at gate A.

58:30.895 --> 58:33.632
Flight 33 to Albany
now boarding at gate B.

58:33.732 --> 58:37.803
Passengers for flight 33 to Albany,
please report to gate B.

58:42.474 --> 58:44.554
What the hell?

58:51.616 --> 58:53.818
I found it.

58:53.918 --> 58:56.897
- Hey!
- Hold on. We got a straggler.

59:13.071 --> 59:16.508
We've been here all day. He's searched
the library, local newspaper...

59:16.608 --> 59:19.511
state records office...
that kind of thing.

59:19.611 --> 59:22.213
No, I'm in Albany.

59:22.313 --> 59:26.618
Yes, I'm in Albany.
He didn't get on the flight to Boston.

59:26.718 --> 59:31.156
- Why didn't he tell me?
- Why? Is something wrong?

59:31.256 --> 59:34.462
- I'm from Albany.
- No kidding.

59:36.694 --> 59:38.663
Now he's gettin'
on the flight to New York.

59:38.763 --> 59:40.934
Listen, I gotta go. It's boarding.

59:45.703 --> 59:47.672
Welcome to New York's La Guardia.

59:47.772 --> 59:51.476
All passengers, flight 286,
arriving from Albany and Buffalo...

59:51.576 --> 59:54.088
please proceed to the baggage area.

59:59.951 --> 01:00:01.496
Brace yourself, Sarah.

01:00:02.453 --> 01:00:05.329
It seems that he has a wife and child.

01:00:07.158 --> 01:00:10.671
There's a little girl here about five.

01:00:30.715 --> 01:00:32.055
Hey!

01:00:59.077 --> 01:01:02.818
Hi, Sarah. It's me. Tony.

01:01:04.215 --> 01:01:06.785
Where are you?

01:01:06.885 --> 01:01:09.621
I tried you at the office.

01:01:09.721 --> 01:01:11.767
I just got back from Boston.

01:01:13.358 --> 01:01:16.094
I'm at the airport.

01:01:16.194 --> 01:01:20.031
Listen, let's meet at my place.

01:01:20.131 --> 01:01:22.768
I can hardly wait to see you.

01:01:23.735 --> 01:01:25.837
I really missed you.

01:04:34.792 --> 01:04:36.838
Just a second.

01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:02.554
- Why did you bar the door?
- I was scared.

01:05:03.988 --> 01:05:07.425
- What took you so long?
- I was calling my service.

01:05:07.525 --> 01:05:09.460
I was paged.

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:13.164
- I can't stay.
- What?

01:05:13.264 --> 01:05:15.933
I have to go. It's an emergency.

01:05:16.033 --> 01:05:18.306
No.

01:05:20.271 --> 01:05:23.511
- No?
- I won't let you.

01:05:26.577 --> 01:05:28.122
I'm just kidding.

01:08:23.621 --> 01:08:25.523
It was attempted homicide, Dr. Taylor...

01:08:25.622 --> 01:08:28.426
and I'm not just talkin'
about your friend, Mr. Raddison.

01:08:28.526 --> 01:08:31.765
We examined your heater.
Those screws were tampered with.

01:08:32.729 --> 01:08:34.935
I think you better talk with...

01:08:36.133 --> 01:08:38.542
with Tony Ramirez.

01:08:50.281 --> 01:08:53.725
- Take care, Dr. Taylor.
- Thanks.

01:09:26.216 --> 01:09:28.319
Tony!

01:09:31.154 --> 01:09:33.791
I was worried about you.

01:09:34.291 --> 01:09:37.337
That gives you the right
to break into my home?

01:09:38.295 --> 01:09:40.341
I don't think so.

01:09:44.935 --> 01:09:47.104
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.

01:09:47.203 --> 01:09:49.875
Give me the phone.

01:09:50.908 --> 01:09:52.645
Don't do that.

01:09:54.145 --> 01:09:55.880
Not yet.

01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:58.060
We have to talk.

01:10:03.454 --> 01:10:05.693
Why are you doing this to me?

01:10:08.058 --> 01:10:10.104
It's over, Sarah.

01:10:11.695 --> 01:10:13.597
It's over.

01:10:13.697 --> 01:10:16.167
Please. Please don't kill me.

01:10:16.267 --> 01:10:18.602
- Please.
- Hey, hey, no.

01:10:18.702 --> 01:10:22.716
Get away from your purse. Don't touch
the gun. Don't fucking move!

01:10:27.711 --> 01:10:29.791
I've seen the file, Tony.

01:10:31.048 --> 01:10:33.651
I know you've been stalking me
right from the beginning.

01:10:35.653 --> 01:10:38.022
You knew it wasn't me.

01:10:38.122 --> 01:10:40.925
If it wasn't you,
why can't I call the police?

01:10:41.025 --> 01:10:44.436
Go ahead. Be my guest.
Call the police. Come on.

01:11:06.650 --> 01:11:10.154
- Why did you do that?
- Why did you go to New York?

01:11:10.254 --> 01:11:13.624
- Who was that woman?
- You want to know the truth?

01:11:13.724 --> 01:11:15.269
Yes.

01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:24.068
That woman in New York is my cousin.
She's also Benny's sister.

01:11:24.168 --> 01:11:27.304
- Benny Martin.
- What does Benny have to do with this?

01:11:27.404 --> 01:11:30.875
Well, the family
wants to know where he is.

01:11:30.975 --> 01:11:34.345
- I was sent here to investigate you.
- You're telling me all this time...

01:11:34.445 --> 01:11:38.716
We want to know what happened to him.
That's why I came here.

01:11:38.816 --> 01:11:42.620
When you were talking about trust?
When I was falling in love with you?

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.623
- I am in love with you, goddamn it!
- I don't believe you!

01:11:45.723 --> 01:11:47.658
You've got to believe me!

01:11:47.758 --> 01:11:50.761
- You want to see something?
- No.

01:11:50.861 --> 01:11:53.731
- Huh?
- No, I don't!

01:11:53.831 --> 01:11:56.233
I put a surveillance
camera in your hallway...

01:11:56.333 --> 01:11:58.602
just to find out who it was.

01:11:58.702 --> 01:12:00.748
Come here.

01:12:21.292 --> 01:12:23.394
It's you, Sarah.

01:12:23.494 --> 01:12:26.864
- You've been stalking yourself.
- That's a lie.

01:12:26.964 --> 01:12:29.670
- You need help.
- It's a lie.

01:12:33.137 --> 01:12:37.185
This is a fucking lie!

01:12:43.447 --> 01:12:44.685
Angel?

01:13:11.875 --> 01:13:14.078
You're not going to leave.
I won't let you.

01:13:14.178 --> 01:13:17.081
You'll never,
ever touch that child again!

01:13:17.181 --> 01:13:20.421
Don't do this, Alison.
Don't make me angry!

01:13:22.486 --> 01:13:25.990
Sweet Jesus. What are
they going to do to me?

01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:29.126
Mama's been bad
and gotten Daddy in trouble.

01:13:29.226 --> 01:13:33.464
You have to help Daddy pull the trigger.

01:13:33.564 --> 01:13:36.338
Do as you're told.

01:13:38.168 --> 01:13:41.205
One, two, three.

01:13:41.305 --> 01:13:43.207
All right. All right.

01:13:43.307 --> 01:13:45.387
Daddy'll help you.

01:13:59.690 --> 01:14:02.999
My mommy is dead.

01:14:05.262 --> 01:14:08.632
She's all gone.

01:14:08.732 --> 01:14:11.435
It was an accident.

01:14:11.535 --> 01:14:14.305
Yes, it was an accident.

01:14:14.405 --> 01:14:16.574
It was just one
of those terrible things.

01:14:16.674 --> 01:14:20.347
She was just a child.
That's why we never talked about it.

01:14:28.118 --> 01:14:31.028
Angel?

01:14:39.897 --> 01:14:42.443
It wasn't an accident, was it?

01:14:43.167 --> 01:14:45.577
You put the gun in my hand.

01:14:48.205 --> 01:14:52.142
- What're you saying?
- She doesn't know what she's saying.

01:14:52.242 --> 01:14:55.879
You think I don't remember
what happened...

01:14:55.979 --> 01:14:58.081
what you did to me every night?

01:14:59.817 --> 01:15:03.160
You think I don't remember
the sound of your shoes...

01:15:04.154 --> 01:15:07.827
Coming into my bedroom every night?

01:15:09.626 --> 01:15:12.329
Why they took me away from you?

01:15:12.429 --> 01:15:15.601
Why my aunt would never let me see you?

01:15:18.068 --> 01:15:22.446
You fooled everybody.
You never fooled me.

01:15:24.408 --> 01:15:27.751
Sarah, give me the gun.

01:15:32.683 --> 01:15:36.424
Here's my gun. I'm gonna take it.

01:15:38.088 --> 01:15:40.862
I'm gonna put it down, all right?

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:52.380
And I want you to do the same thing.

01:15:54.471 --> 01:15:56.517
You don't wanna shoot me, right?

01:15:58.108 --> 01:16:00.154
You gonna kill me?

01:16:04.681 --> 01:16:07.159
Give me the gun.

01:16:08.986 --> 01:16:11.862
- Trust me.
- Trust me.

01:16:15.058 --> 01:16:16.432
Sure.

01:16:18.328 --> 01:16:19.736
Fucker.

01:16:36.713 --> 01:16:41.353
Now you know what happened to Benny.
You were so fuckin' interested.

01:16:42.319 --> 01:16:45.856
He was a worthless
piece of shit, like you.

01:16:45.956 --> 01:16:49.697
Like all men. Like all men!

01:17:03.073 --> 01:17:06.746
It's all right, Sarah.
We can deal with this.

01:17:07.411 --> 01:17:09.847
Fuck! Now look what
you've gone and done!

01:17:09.947 --> 01:17:12.716
And I'm gonna have to
fuckin' cover for you again!

01:17:12.816 --> 01:17:15.226
Goddamn it! I'm sick of it!

01:17:17.955 --> 01:17:20.968
Oh. I'm sorry.

01:17:22.893 --> 01:17:25.837
I'm sorry. Help, please.

01:17:26.797 --> 01:17:29.002
It wasn't your fault.

01:17:32.469 --> 01:17:34.708
We'll tell 'em it wasn't your fault.

01:17:42.512 --> 01:17:45.215
You're right.

01:17:45.315 --> 01:17:48.021
It was never my fault.

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.559
Oh, please.

01:17:54.491 --> 01:17:57.595
Please, I know what I did.

01:17:58.562 --> 01:18:01.598
I know what I did to you.

01:18:01.698 --> 01:18:05.211
- Do you believe in justice?
- No.

01:18:05.903 --> 01:18:07.448
Please.

01:18:25.088 --> 01:18:27.134
It never happened.

01:18:48.045 --> 01:18:50.352
Never happened like that.

01:18:52.115 --> 01:18:54.161
Never happened.

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:59.264
I'm not gonna remember any of this.

01:19:01.792 --> 01:19:05.499
All right, Sarah.
It's gonna be all right.

01:19:08.966 --> 01:19:11.012
It was self-defense.

01:19:45.802 --> 01:19:50.274
"Ramirez shot my father several times,
and then he turned his gun towards me.

01:19:50.374 --> 01:19:53.176
I fired once.
The next thing I remember...

01:19:53.276 --> 01:19:56.246
I was standing over Tony Ramirez's
body with a gun in my hand.

01:19:56.346 --> 01:20:00.183
Detective Spatz came into the room.
I'm not sure how much time had gone by...

01:20:00.283 --> 01:20:04.154
but I can't believe it could have
been more than a few minutes."

01:20:04.254 --> 01:20:06.690
Okay, Sarah.

01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:10.030
Would you mind signing the bottom
of your statement, please?

01:20:13.397 --> 01:20:17.343
Can you imagine seeing your father
blown away right in front of ya?

01:20:19.436 --> 01:20:22.642
- Will she have to stand trial?
- I can't imagine.

01:20:27.611 --> 01:20:31.315
Multiple Personality Disorder
cannot easily be faked.

01:20:31.415 --> 01:20:35.218
Witness the case of recently
convicted serial killer Max Cheski...

01:20:35.318 --> 01:20:38.588
who tried to use it
as the basis of his defense.

01:20:38.688 --> 01:20:40.657
The creation
of multiple personalities...

01:20:40.757 --> 01:20:43.493
can always be traced
back to childhood trauma...

01:20:43.593 --> 01:20:45.629
often involving violent sexual abuse.

01:20:45.729 --> 01:20:51.335
Subconsciously, the child creates other
personalities that share the burden...

01:20:51.435 --> 01:20:55.405
the literally unbearable
burden of shame...

01:20:55.505 --> 01:21:00.077
underlying the repressed memory
of the childhood events.

01:21:00.177 --> 01:21:03.313
These personalities often
turn against their creator...

01:21:03.413 --> 01:21:06.585
sometimes inflicting actual bodily harm.

01:21:09.553 --> 01:21:12.422
I wasn't expecting you so early.

01:21:12.522 --> 01:21:14.624
- What time does the movie start?
- 8:00.

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.406
Let's go.

01:21:21.832 --> 01:21:24.634
- So, how's your lecture coming?
- Good.

01:21:24.734 --> 01:21:27.237
- You gonna be okay?
- I think so.

01:21:27.337 --> 01:21:29.883
It's a very, very interesting disorder.

01:21:31.041 --> 01:21:33.977
I've never addressed
one of these big conventions.

01:21:34.077 --> 01:21:36.623
Come on. They're gonna love you.

01:21:43.053 --> 01:21:45.521
So good to have you
back to your old self.

01:21:45.522 --> 01:21:47.568
Thanks.
