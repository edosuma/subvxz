Announcer:
Previously on "Haven"...

00:02.378 --> 00:03.458
- Jennifer, can you hear me?

00:03.546 --> 00:04.752
- I have to get you
to understand

00:04.839 --> 00:06.170
that Jennifer is gone.

00:06.257 --> 00:08.339
Dwight saw her body.
- Shut up!

00:08.426 --> 00:09.757
I really am gonna miss her.

00:09.844 --> 00:11.550
- Terrible when you find out
people you trust

00:11.637 --> 00:12.626
are keeping secrets.

00:12.722 --> 00:14.212
Why didn't you tell me
Mara was responsible

00:14.307 --> 00:15.296
for bringing the Troubles
to Haven?

00:15.391 --> 00:17.973
- I didn't want you
to look at Audrey differently.

00:18.060 --> 00:20.016
- Audrey is Mara,
and right now Mara is doing

00:20.104 --> 00:22.140
everything she can
to destroy this place.

00:22.231 --> 00:23.767
You're letting your affection
for Audrey

00:23.858 --> 00:25.018
hurt everyone else
in this town.

00:25.109 --> 00:27.100
- I am gonna get her
and bring her to you.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.526
I'm gonna give Mara
to the Guard,

00:28.613 --> 00:30.319
let them see if they can get her
to end all this.

00:30.406 --> 00:33.022
Mara started the Troubles.
Maybe she can stop them.

00:33.117 --> 00:35.449
- I can't leave Haven.
William and I are not done.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.197
(branch snaps)

00:40.625 --> 00:43.332
- Good-bye, Parker.
- (gaSPS)

00:43.419 --> 00:45.375
- Nathan, please,
I'm still here.

00:45.463 --> 00:46.498
I'm still...

00:46.589 --> 00:47.578
(groans)

00:47.673 --> 00:50.210
You are making a huge mistake.

00:50.301 --> 00:51.711
Hey!

00:58.643 --> 01:01.055
(cell phone ringing)

01:07.526 --> 01:08.857
- Tell me you found her.

01:08.945 --> 01:10.230
- No.

01:10.321 --> 01:12.482
- It’s been 12 hours.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.074
- She's smart.

01:14.158 --> 01:16.649
- I know she's smart, but if
Mara finds her stash of Aether,

01:16.744 --> 01:19.360
she troubles the whole town,
the whole state,

01:19.455 --> 01:20.695
the whole world?

01:20.790 --> 01:22.280
- She doesn't know
where it is.

01:22.375 --> 01:23.740
- But we don ’t know where she
is.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.699
I got the H.P.D.
and Guard looking for her.

01:25.795 --> 01:28.081
- You're giving the Guard
orders now?

01:28.172 --> 01:30.288
- Yeah. Vince knew Mara
created the troubles.

01:30.383 --> 01:32.840
People didn't like how he
handled it.

01:32.927 --> 01:34.918
Find Mara, Nathan.

01:35.012 --> 01:38.004
(cell phone beeps)
- You filthy liar.

01:40.351 --> 01:42.433
- I'm kind of with her on that.

01:44.981 --> 01:46.266
- Thanks for the supplies.

01:46.357 --> 01:47.563
- Yeah, yeah.

01:47.650 --> 01:49.231
- I know what this looks like,

01:49.318 --> 01:52.776
and I know I have made mistakes
before.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.728
But...

01:54.824 --> 01:57.691
Mara--
She will not help us.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.276
So getting Audrey back
is still our best hope.

02:00.371 --> 02:01.611
- Could you guys speak up?

02:01.706 --> 02:03.913
You're making it difficult
to eavesdrop.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.457
- Nathan, you need to listen to
me.

02:06.544 --> 02:08.409
Audrey is gone.

02:08.504 --> 02:10.620
- No.

02:10.715 --> 02:11.750
She talked to me.

02:11.841 --> 02:13.047
- Nathan...

02:13.134 --> 02:16.092
- She did.
She needs our help, Duke.

02:16.178 --> 02:19.045
- We've all lost people.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.144
I had to bury Jennifer last
night.

02:24.228 --> 02:25.889
But we grieve.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.596
We don't go crazy.

02:29.734 --> 02:31.315
- After everything
we've been through,

02:31.402 --> 02:32.767
you got to give me this.

02:32.862 --> 02:36.025
Just give me some time
to get Audrey back.

02:37.116 --> 02:38.105
- How?

02:38.200 --> 02:40.065
- I don't know.

02:43.289 --> 02:45.530
- (sighs)

02:45.624 --> 02:47.160
You got 24 hours.

02:47.251 --> 02:49.116
- You believe me?

02:50.629 --> 02:53.587
- No.

02:53.674 --> 02:58.168
I believe you need
to move on...

02:58.262 --> 02:59.843
...any way you can.

03:30.461 --> 03:33.294
(scissors cutting)

03:43.891 --> 03:46.553
- We'll eat breakfast,
then keep moving.

03:46.644 --> 03:48.976
(chains rattle)

04:03.244 --> 04:04.233
- Mm.

04:04.328 --> 04:05.363
(spits)

04:06.664 --> 04:08.404
- All right, this needs
cream or sugar

04:08.499 --> 04:10.285
to be remotely drinkable.

04:13.879 --> 04:14.994
- Oh.

04:17.675 --> 04:20.838
- I'm going to hurt you
the first chance I get.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.213
And I won't need a tree to do
it.

04:22.304 --> 04:23.840
- Well, that would be stupid,

04:23.931 --> 04:25.592
'cause the cops want
to arrest you.

04:25.683 --> 04:27.093
The Guard wants to kill you.

04:27.184 --> 04:29.220
Right now they're kind of
the same thing.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.097
- Oh, is that what this
is all about--

04:31.188 --> 04:32.769
You protecting someone?

04:32.857 --> 04:35.769
News flash-- it's not me.

04:35.860 --> 04:37.851
(vehicle approaching)

04:40.531 --> 04:41.896
Who are these boneheads?

04:41.991 --> 04:43.947
- I don't know.
Just be cool.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.491
- Listen, I promise not to kill
you

04:46.579 --> 04:48.035
if you help me figure out
how those thinnies were sealed.

04:49.165 --> 04:50.621
- No.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.121
- How about if I promise

04:54.211 --> 04:57.544
to forget about William
and his secret little stash.

04:57.631 --> 04:58.620
- Shut up.

04:58.716 --> 05:00.377
- Take these off.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.208
- No.
- I'm shackled.

05:02.303 --> 05:04.259
- Then don't say anything
stupid.

05:06.140 --> 05:09.632
Mitchell, about time
you guys got here.

05:09.727 --> 05:11.888
- Is that Mara?

05:16.358 --> 05:17.973
- I called this in a while ago.

05:18.068 --> 05:21.310
- Oh.

05:21.405 --> 05:22.440
Didn't hear anything.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.273
Get Dwight.

05:30.748 --> 05:32.488
- No, there's no need.
Let's just go--

05:32.583 --> 05:33.572
- (gasps)

05:35.211 --> 05:36.826
- Drop the phone.

05:36.921 --> 05:38.252
Mara: Get off of me.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.170
- I knew it.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.667
- Let her go.
- I don't know what it is

05:41.759 --> 05:42.965
with you and this woman, Nathan.

05:43.052 --> 05:44.917
- She might be able
to help us, Mitchell.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.001
- Help us?

05:46.096 --> 05:47.961
So many people are dead
because of her.

05:48.057 --> 05:51.470
I've had enough.
Why does she get to live?

05:51.560 --> 05:54.097
- Oh, ah!

05:58.859 --> 05:59.894
Shoot him!

06:08.369 --> 06:10.405
- Ah, come on.

06:10.496 --> 06:12.657
(sighs)

06:15.292 --> 06:16.828
We're closed.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.498
Wherever you are,
I'm telling you,

06:20.589 --> 06:23.205
today is not the day to try to
rob me.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.086
- Hi, Duke.

06:28.389 --> 06:29.595
-Jody?

06:31.267 --> 06:32.427
Come here.

06:32.518 --> 06:34.634
Hey.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.719
How are you?

06:38.774 --> 06:42.016
Hey, you okay?

06:42.111 --> 06:45.319
- Charlotte and the baby-- I...

06:45.406 --> 06:47.237
I need money to get them
out of town.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.189
- I thought you and Gavin,
you know,

06:49.285 --> 06:50.491
found religion and went legit.

06:50.578 --> 06:53.069
- Can you get me
the cash or not?

06:53.163 --> 06:57.247
- I can give you
what I have on me.

06:57.334 --> 06:58.323
You want to tell me
where you're going?

06:58.419 --> 07:00.410
- Why do you have to know
everything?

07:02.214 --> 07:03.249
-ldon%.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.207
- I need to leave.
I need--

07:07.303 --> 07:09.419
something's wrong.
- Jody, I want to help.

07:09.513 --> 07:10.548
- No, don't!

07:10.639 --> 07:11.719
Don't come any closer.

07:11.807 --> 07:14.264
You have no idea
what I've already done.

07:14.351 --> 07:17.343
(rumbling)

07:22.651 --> 07:24.187
- Jody...

07:24.278 --> 07:25.518
...what's happening?

07:26.614 --> 07:27.854
(lights whirring)

07:37.708 --> 07:38.993
(gasps)

07:53.974 --> 07:56.056
(engine turning over)

07:56.143 --> 07:57.178
(tires screeching)

08:00.064 --> 08:02.521
J‘J‘

08:32.930 --> 08:35.012
- You make an appalling partner.

08:35.099 --> 08:36.339
Did you see what I did?

08:36.433 --> 08:38.424
- It seems like
your signature move.

08:38.519 --> 08:39.634
(handcuffs clicking)

08:39.728 --> 08:41.764
One of your personalities
work in a rodeo?

08:41.855 --> 08:43.186
- A horse ranch.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.647
- We'll head south
like we planned,

08:49.738 --> 08:52.070
lay low until this thing cools
off.

08:52.157 --> 08:55.320
- Hey, Wuornos, you should have
put that bullet in my head.

08:55.411 --> 08:57.367
This ends when one of us
stops breathing.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.445
- Yeah. It's gonna be you.

08:59.540 --> 09:00.871
- Don't be so sure.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.036
- That ugly little pug cut me.

09:04.128 --> 09:07.871
- Exactly. You bleed.
You can be hurt.

09:07.965 --> 09:08.954
- So can they.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.540
- That is two of them,
and we had the drop.

09:11.635 --> 09:14.627
The entire Guard
and the entire Haven P.D.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.428
are looking for us.

09:16.515 --> 09:19.507
So our best bet right now
is to disappear.

09:21.645 --> 09:23.181
- I'm not camping.

09:27.943 --> 09:29.899
(indistinct chatter)

09:29.987 --> 09:31.022
- (sighs)

09:31.113 --> 09:33.695
man: Check the perimeter,
forensic team is on its way.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.405
- New look?
- Yeah.

09:40.831 --> 09:43.072
- Well, I'm glad you showed.
I could use your help on this.

09:43.167 --> 09:44.657
You saw Jody today?

09:44.752 --> 09:46.708
- She came by the Gull.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.911
I got the burn marks to prove
it.

09:52.468 --> 09:54.174
Who's that?

09:54.261 --> 09:56.547
- Jody's sister.
- Where are the kids?

09:56.638 --> 09:58.014
- Baby's fine.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.759
He's in Haven Memorial
getting a checkup.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.389
- HoW's her daughter
Charlotte doing?

10:05.773 --> 10:06.762
- First-degree burns.

10:08.025 --> 10:09.890
She'll be okay.

10:17.493 --> 10:20.109
- So we're back

10:20.204 --> 10:24.413
at your dad's secret dump
in the woods.

10:24.500 --> 10:25.785
- You remember being here?

10:25.876 --> 10:28.959
- You dragged me off
after William arrived

10:29.046 --> 10:32.664
so you could assert
your manliness

10:32.758 --> 10:34.919
with cheap wine and flaccid...

10:36.637 --> 10:38.093
...dancing.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.967
- No one's gonna look for us
here.

10:43.685 --> 10:44.845
Just in case.

10:44.937 --> 10:46.473
female dispatcher: Radio check.

10:46.563 --> 10:50.431
Units 1-4 and 1-6
searching South Caumsett Hollow,

10:50.526 --> 10:52.266
staying on 2-2.

10:54.238 --> 10:56.570
- I know why you're hiding.

10:56.657 --> 11:00.821
But do you actually expect me
to like you for this?

11:00.911 --> 11:03.118
- No. I'm doing what I have to.

11:08.752 --> 11:09.741
- You're mentally ill.

11:10.796 --> 11:13.458
You actually think
she's still alive, don't you?

11:13.549 --> 11:17.508
- I know Audrey's in there... in
you.

11:17.594 --> 11:18.629
- You're wrong.

11:18.720 --> 11:19.880
(clicks tongue)

11:19.972 --> 11:22.213
I snuffed her out
like a candle.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.640
- Then I guess this'll all be
over soon.

11:32.484 --> 11:37.820
(chains rattling)

11:43.745 --> 11:46.828
- So just had these
laying around, huh?

11:46.915 --> 11:48.200
That's kinky.

11:52.963 --> 11:54.328
So...

11:54.423 --> 11:56.505
...is this how you're gonna
get her out,

11:56.592 --> 11:59.083
by deprogramming me?

12:00.971 --> 12:02.507
I got an idea.

12:02.598 --> 12:05.556
We could have a séance,

12:05.642 --> 12:11.638
or, if you got a Ouija board,
we could-- Voodoo.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.064
Go get a chicken.
I can cut off its head.

12:14.151 --> 12:16.733
- Audrey's not dead.

12:16.820 --> 12:20.153
- So then what's your plan
to get her out, huh?

12:24.328 --> 12:26.068
Come on, Eeyore,
what's your plan?

12:26.163 --> 12:28.745
- You'd be the last person I'd
tell.

12:31.752 --> 12:34.209
- You know, it's ironic
that your obsession

12:34.296 --> 12:37.254
with that woman
is what brought me back.

12:37.341 --> 12:40.708
Everything you kept doing
for her was helping me.

12:40.802 --> 12:45.671
If you hadn't have shot Agent
Howard or blown up the Barn,

12:45.766 --> 12:49.384
I still would've been trapped
in there for 27 years.

12:49.478 --> 12:53.437
And William never would have
been able to get me out.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.434
Oh, right, though.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.186
You didn't have a choice.

12:58.362 --> 13:01.695
You just love her
so damn much.

13:06.912 --> 13:10.780
You're nothing without your love
for Audrey.

13:10.874 --> 13:14.742
You're just lifeless
and numb.

13:14.836 --> 13:18.795
It really is sad how much
you need her.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.923
Do you know in Russia
they call this...

13:22.010 --> 13:23.386
(Russian accent)
"Game of String"?

13:23.470 --> 13:24.459
(normal voice)
I tell you,

13:24.554 --> 13:26.806
they've got no imagination.

13:26.890 --> 13:30.474
- A lot of people need Audrey.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.720
No one needs you.

13:31.812 --> 13:34.554
- Oh, they need me.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.138
They just don't know it yet.

13:36.233 --> 13:37.973
- Maybe William did.

13:38.068 --> 13:40.059
But you haven't said
that you want him back

13:40.153 --> 13:41.484
because you love him.

13:42.823 --> 13:45.610
Maybe he's just a way for you
to create more Troubles.

13:49.538 --> 13:51.403
Is that all you care about?

13:51.498 --> 13:55.286
What are you
without the Troubles, Mara--

13:55.377 --> 13:58.790
Lifeless, numb?

13:58.880 --> 14:01.166
Are you even capable of love?

14:01.258 --> 14:02.964
(book clatters)

14:34.416 --> 14:35.701
(engine turning over)

14:37.669 --> 14:40.206
- So the sister had a hole
burned right through her

14:40.297 --> 14:42.333
and the wound
was cauterized,

14:42.424 --> 14:45.291
and the surrounding area
looked like it was sunburned.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.000
- So she was killed by some kind
of high-powered

14:47.095 --> 14:48.551
beam of sunlight?

14:48.638 --> 14:52.222
Duke said the light dimmed
when Jody scorched the Gull--

14:52.309 --> 14:54.721
not the light inside,
but the daylight.

14:54.811 --> 14:57.518
- So some kind
of sunlight-amplifying Trouble?

14:57.606 --> 14:59.471
- Sounds like it.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.899
- Jeez.
Get out your S.P.F. 5 million.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.487
(cell phone rings)

15:09.159 --> 15:11.445
(cell phone beeps)
- Yeah?

15:14.081 --> 15:16.163
I'm with her daughter now.
I'll tell her.

15:17.292 --> 15:18.281
(cell phone beeps)

15:19.294 --> 15:21.626
(exhales deeply)

15:23.256 --> 15:24.996
There was another accident
with your mom.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.048
- Are they gonna arrest her?

15:27.135 --> 15:28.921
- I don't know, Charlotte.

15:31.681 --> 15:36.425
But you said that there was one
beam of light this morning.

15:36.520 --> 15:37.726
When I saw her, there was two.

15:37.813 --> 15:39.599
And now they're saying
there's four.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.270
- Mom's getting worse.

15:41.358 --> 15:44.100
- I need to find your mom.

15:44.194 --> 15:45.434
Where's your dad?
Would she go to him?

15:45.529 --> 15:48.817
- No. They've been fighting
since Mom lost herjob.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.607
Then Dad left.
- (sighs)

15:51.701 --> 15:55.489
- I should've done something
to help them, you know?

15:55.580 --> 15:57.320
- This is not your fault.

15:59.543 --> 16:02.706
The Troubles, they just come.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.127
You can't control them.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.708
(groans, coughs)
- Are you-- are you okay?

16:09.803 --> 16:11.088
I mean, you look kind of sick.

16:11.179 --> 16:13.135
- Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

16:17.519 --> 16:18.554
Charlotte, I'm gonna do
everything I can

16:18.645 --> 16:20.431
to help your mom.

16:20.522 --> 16:22.228
- Okay.

16:25.569 --> 16:27.776
Duke?
- Yeah?

16:27.863 --> 16:31.151
- There's something
I have to tell you.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.357
- (pounds on door)
We got a break.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.533
So Jody texted Charlotte
to bring her brother

16:35.620 --> 16:39.238
to that old furniture warehouse
on the edge of town at midnight.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.620
- Nathan isn't looking for Mara.
He's working with her.

16:42.711 --> 16:45.168
Mitchell called,
said they tied him up

16:45.255 --> 16:46.791
and escaped.

16:46.882 --> 16:48.042
You know anything
about that?

16:49.551 --> 16:51.132
- Look...
(sighs)

16:51.219 --> 16:53.505
I'm sure that Nathan knows
what he's doing.

16:53.597 --> 16:54.837
- Yeah, like blowing up his life

16:54.931 --> 16:56.546
and taking the entire town
with him.

16:58.602 --> 17:00.388
- Did Mitchell say
where they were going?

17:00.478 --> 17:02.685
- Headed south. Nathan will go
someplace familiar...

17:02.772 --> 17:04.558
...remote.

17:04.649 --> 17:05.684
- His old fishing shack.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.686
- I already got guys
headed there.

17:18.705 --> 17:19.694
- So...

17:19.789 --> 17:21.404
...not a peep
from one of Dwight's

17:21.499 --> 17:23.455
big, bad search parties,

17:23.543 --> 17:27.081
and it's almost bedtime.

17:27.172 --> 17:31.290
Looks like the Guard isn't
as dangerous as you thought.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.805
And it looks like
there's only one bed.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.731
That's funny.

17:48.818 --> 17:53.027
I don't remember it being so--
so tiny.

17:54.824 --> 17:55.904
But then again, the last time,

17:55.992 --> 18:00.361
personal space
really wasn't an issue, was it?

18:00.455 --> 18:03.242
- No, it wasn't.

18:06.169 --> 18:08.205
- We made s'mores,

18:08.296 --> 18:11.914
and the marshmallows
kept falling in the fire.

18:21.351 --> 18:25.094
The whole room
smelled of burnt sugar.

18:25.188 --> 18:27.679
- That was Audrey.

18:35.365 --> 18:38.482
- I know you can feel me.

18:57.387 --> 19:00.550
How long has it been

19:00.640 --> 19:05.805
since it was just you and her

19:05.895 --> 19:10.639
alone in the quiet like this...

19:12.319 --> 19:14.856
...beside the fire?

19:18.825 --> 19:21.692
It's okay if you're lonely.

19:23.788 --> 19:28.703
We can pretend
if we both just close our eyes.

19:53.568 --> 19:54.774
man: Let's go, boys.

20:07.082 --> 20:09.915
- Damn it.
Nobody's here. Call Dwight.

20:26.184 --> 20:27.219
- (grunts)

20:27.310 --> 20:28.925
- (gasps)

20:29.020 --> 20:32.057
What?

20:32.148 --> 20:33.763
You didn't like it?

20:39.239 --> 20:40.695
(lock clicks)

20:51.000 --> 20:53.582
- You sleep over there, alone.

20:53.670 --> 20:56.286
- Prude.

20:59.008 --> 21:02.171
How else are we supposed
to kill time?

21:05.849 --> 21:08.761
I don't even know
what we're doing here.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.390
You don't even have a TV.

21:20.530 --> 21:24.239
I don't expect to be here
much longer anyway.

21:24.325 --> 21:27.783
I mean, how long before someone
is banging on that door?

21:27.871 --> 21:30.863
You practically told the Guard
where we were going.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.117
- Yeah, south.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.035
This place is north.

21:37.130 --> 21:40.088
- Well, you run a good scam,
coppen

21:41.885 --> 21:45.218
Maybe we will be here for a
while.

21:50.059 --> 21:51.469
- Fishing shack was a bust.

21:51.561 --> 21:53.142
Doubled the number
of people searching.

21:53.229 --> 21:56.096
- You know, I don't know
what's going on,

21:56.191 --> 21:58.648
but I'm sure Nathan thinks
he's doing the right thing.

21:58.735 --> 21:59.724
- You got to be
kidding me, right?

21:59.819 --> 22:01.650
When it comes to Audrey,
Nathan is incapable

22:01.738 --> 22:02.773
of making a good decision.

22:02.864 --> 22:04.729
People have died,
others at risk,

22:04.824 --> 22:06.109
including you, Duke.

22:06.201 --> 22:08.157
In case no one told you,
you look like hell.

22:09.204 --> 22:11.286
- (sighs)

22:18.922 --> 22:22.380
- Why don't you go to sleep?
- Why don't you go to sleep?

22:22.467 --> 22:24.879
- I'm not tired.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.933
Tell me about
where you come from.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.931
Why aren't you trying
to get back there?

22:36.022 --> 22:37.387
Don't you have friends
and family?

22:37.482 --> 22:39.097
- Of course.

22:39.192 --> 22:42.025
And I will, when I'm finished
my work here.

22:42.111 --> 22:44.693
It'll be quite the reunion.

22:44.781 --> 22:47.113
I'm very much
looking forward to it.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.361
- And what is it you think
you're doing here

22:49.452 --> 22:52.660
besides causing pain,
destruction?

22:52.747 --> 22:54.362
- Proving a point.

22:54.457 --> 22:56.789
- To who?
- Let's just say

22:56.876 --> 23:01.540
that sometimes brilliance is
celebrated,

23:01.631 --> 23:03.246
and sometimes it's smothered.

23:04.634 --> 23:09.674
Anyway, we're stuck here
until this search is over.

23:09.764 --> 23:12.255
Neither of us are tired.

23:12.350 --> 23:18.095
And we could be having fun,
except for you're wearing...

23:18.189 --> 23:20.396
...a chastity belt.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.225
- Not happening.

23:23.319 --> 23:25.731
- Oh, god.

23:25.822 --> 23:27.483
Would you evolve already?

23:27.574 --> 23:29.189
Sex is cardio.

23:29.284 --> 23:31.866
If sex makes a relationship,

23:31.953 --> 23:35.571
then everything you say you feel
for Audrey would be a lie.

23:35.665 --> 23:37.405
- It's real.

23:37.500 --> 23:41.709
- And your poke with Sarah
on the beach-- That was real.

23:41.796 --> 23:44.003
You should have met the others.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.751
Lucy was such a tramp.

23:45.842 --> 23:49.084
And Veronica--
She swung both ways.

23:49.178 --> 23:51.089
- That's enough.
- (laughs)

23:52.974 --> 23:54.134
(sighs)

23:54.225 --> 23:55.214
Whatever.

23:56.853 --> 23:57.842
But, you know,

23:57.937 --> 24:01.555
this bed is going to get
everything

24:01.649 --> 24:05.141
that you just turned down.

24:11.618 --> 24:14.030
You know I have all
of Audrey's memories, right?

24:15.371 --> 24:19.535
Do you everjust wonder

24:19.626 --> 24:22.083
if she loved you
as much as you loved her?

24:26.007 --> 24:27.543
- No.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.920
- Okay, then.

24:30.011 --> 24:31.967
Night.

24:36.059 --> 24:37.890
(sighs)

24:46.903 --> 24:49.315
(fire crackles)

25:04.337 --> 25:08.250
(chains rattling)

25:27.110 --> 25:30.352
- I'm so sorry, Audrey.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.985
I don't know what to do.

25:35.076 --> 25:36.282
I'm running out of time.

25:37.578 --> 25:38.863
- (gasps)

25:38.955 --> 25:39.944
Nathan...

25:41.207 --> 25:42.868
Please help me.

25:42.959 --> 25:45.166
l'm-- I'm here.

25:45.253 --> 25:48.040
- Parker?
- Don't give up.

25:48.131 --> 25:49.621
Don't talk to Mara.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.798
Just talk to me like Audrey.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.840
It's the only way
that I can fight her.

25:53.928 --> 25:55.043
- Parker.

25:55.138 --> 25:56.844
- Please.

25:56.931 --> 25:58.387
- Audrey.
- Talk to me.

25:58.474 --> 26:00.180
- Don't go.
Stay with me.

26:00.268 --> 26:02.179
- (exhales sharply)
- Audrey.

26:11.612 --> 26:14.149
(keys clacking)

26:17.410 --> 26:19.150
(cell phone chimes)

26:21.038 --> 26:22.027
- (sighs)

26:22.123 --> 26:23.659
(cell phone beeps)

26:28.337 --> 26:30.202
Don't worry.

26:30.298 --> 26:32.459
(cell phone beeps)
Just the usual,

26:32.550 --> 26:35.462
somebody needs a favor.

26:37.805 --> 26:40.797
(door closes)

26:43.269 --> 26:46.181
- Charlotte, where are you?

26:47.440 --> 26:50.432
My kids, what have you done with
them?

26:50.526 --> 26:51.606
- They're okay.

26:51.694 --> 26:53.104
Jody, it's me.

26:53.196 --> 26:54.402
I'm here to help you.

26:54.489 --> 26:56.275
Charlotte told me

26:56.365 --> 26:59.732
about you losing yourjob
and Gavin leaving.

26:59.827 --> 27:01.943
- Don't-- don't talk about
Gavin.

27:02.038 --> 27:04.370
- What happened to your sister
wasn't your fault.

27:04.457 --> 27:06.322
You can't control your Trouble,
butjust coming here at night,

27:06.417 --> 27:08.703
you're already starting
to manage it.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.706
- You don't know what happened.

27:10.797 --> 27:12.207
Charlotte would hate me.

27:12.298 --> 27:15.711
l-- I can't.
I can't lose her too.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.758
(electricity crackles)

27:17.845 --> 27:18.834
(lights buzzing)

27:18.930 --> 27:21.171
What's going on?

27:24.060 --> 27:26.221
Make it stop.

27:27.688 --> 27:28.814
(lights whirring)

27:28.898 --> 27:30.388
(gasps)

27:30.483 --> 27:32.474
This shouldn't be happening,
not at night.

27:35.071 --> 27:36.060
- (grunts)

27:37.824 --> 27:39.064
- (gasps)

27:48.876 --> 27:50.662
- (groans)

27:50.753 --> 27:53.961
It's notjust sunlight.
It's all light.

27:59.095 --> 28:00.084
(lights whirring)

28:10.690 --> 28:13.432
- Duke, get out of here!
- I can't do that, Jody.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.983
I'm pretty sure
you owe me money,

28:16.070 --> 28:17.856
and you're lighting stuff on
fire.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.028
- Duke, get the fire blankets.

28:23.119 --> 28:24.529
Handle her.
I'll put out the fire.

28:32.628 --> 28:33.879
- Go.

28:48.477 --> 28:51.139
It's okay, Jody.

28:51.230 --> 28:54.814
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

29:06.871 --> 29:09.032
- Morning, Parker.

29:10.875 --> 29:12.490
Food's up in ten.

29:12.585 --> 29:14.951
- You have officially cracked
up.

29:22.303 --> 29:26.171
- That sedative I gave her will
help her sleep a little longer.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.425
- Yeah, and then what?

29:27.516 --> 29:28.722
Spends the rest of her life

29:28.809 --> 29:30.265
covered in a fire-retardant
blanket?

29:30.353 --> 29:33.436
- We find Mara,
maybe she won't have to.

29:36.567 --> 29:38.307
(cell phone beeps)

29:45.534 --> 29:47.741
(computer chimes)

29:53.960 --> 29:55.245
- (sighs)

29:55.336 --> 29:57.201
- Don't you cook anything else?

29:57.296 --> 30:00.709
- This is the good stuff,
not buckwheat.

30:06.722 --> 30:09.634
You really don't remember?
- Remember what?

30:11.560 --> 30:12.549
- Forget it.

30:15.064 --> 30:16.179
Eat your pancakes.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.729
So, Parker,

30:21.821 --> 30:24.779
I have maple syrup
and blueberry syrup.

30:24.865 --> 30:26.480
Which one do you want?

30:26.575 --> 30:28.361
- I'm going to give you a
Trouble

30:28.452 --> 30:31.159
that makes your heart explode
inside of your chest.

30:31.247 --> 30:33.283
- Maple it is.

30:38.754 --> 30:41.666
- Thanks for taking care of my
kids.

30:41.757 --> 30:47.252
- Yeah, I meant to tell you,
they're monsters.

30:47.346 --> 30:50.338
No, really, they--
they're horrible people.

30:52.977 --> 30:56.140
- I almost hurt them.
My sister's gone.

30:56.230 --> 30:59.142
And Gavin...

30:59.233 --> 31:02.020
- Yeah, try not to think about
it.

31:02.111 --> 31:03.521
That's what I do.

31:03.612 --> 31:06.854
- You've seen some pretty
awful things, huh, Duke?

31:08.367 --> 31:09.698
The McLaren job,

31:09.785 --> 31:12.527
New Orleans,

31:12.621 --> 31:14.612
but none of it like this.

31:15.791 --> 31:20.330
I don't think anything is as bad
as killing your own family.

31:25.885 --> 31:26.874
(shudders)

31:29.388 --> 31:30.548
-Jody?

31:30.639 --> 31:34.427
- I'm so tired.

31:34.518 --> 31:35.894
The light.

31:35.978 --> 31:39.937
- Light?
- I'm sorry.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.566
- You need the light to survive.

31:44.653 --> 31:45.642
Okay.

31:47.531 --> 31:49.317
Jody, I want you to hang on.

31:52.119 --> 31:54.496
I'm not gonna let you die.

31:59.585 --> 32:02.247
- So Jody needs to absorb light
to stay alive?

32:02.338 --> 32:03.919
- Yeah. When that light
comes back out,

32:04.006 --> 32:05.917
everybody besides Jody gets
dead.

32:08.010 --> 32:10.717
- I can take her someplace
safer, Guard-controlled.

32:10.805 --> 32:11.794
- No.

32:13.933 --> 32:16.174
Just don't take her
anywhere yet, okay?

32:16.268 --> 32:17.769
Maybe...

32:17.853 --> 32:20.105
(sighs)

32:20.189 --> 32:21.554
- You do know where they are.

32:22.650 --> 32:23.935
Do you have any idea the risk?

32:24.026 --> 32:25.266
- Nathan has her chained up.

32:25.361 --> 32:26.601
- Why?
What's he doing?

32:29.532 --> 32:31.443
- Hoping for something
that isn't gonna happen.

32:32.701 --> 32:35.283
- Audrey.
- You know what? Screw it.

32:35.371 --> 32:37.953
I will bring them to you.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.076
- Why should I trust you?

32:41.961 --> 32:44.247
- I'm not gonna let Jody die.

32:55.891 --> 32:57.097
- Now what?

32:57.184 --> 32:59.846
- Wait right here.

33:04.233 --> 33:05.939
(oldies music playing)

33:07.820 --> 33:09.560
J‘J‘

33:18.497 --> 33:20.408
- Dance with me, Parker.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.455
- I'd rather stab you in the
crotch.

33:22.543 --> 33:23.532
-Hmm.

33:23.627 --> 33:26.334
female dispatcher: 1-6, 1-9,
commencing door-to-door grid

33:26.422 --> 33:28.629
from Marcoon Woods
to the Congin Ridge.

33:28.716 --> 33:30.923
- We should enjoy
the time we have left.

33:31.010 --> 33:31.999
It might not last.

33:32.094 --> 33:35.928
- So you want to get stabbed
in the crotch.

33:37.600 --> 33:39.511
- Come on.

33:39.602 --> 33:41.558
- All right.

33:43.939 --> 33:45.895
- Come on.

33:47.776 --> 33:50.028
- You can treat me like Audrey,

33:50.112 --> 33:52.899
but you can't make me
act like her.

33:52.990 --> 33:54.446
- Shh.

33:56.035 --> 33:58.742
- Have you ever considered
an inflatable doll?

34:00.664 --> 34:05.579
- You know that blue dress,
the one from your birthday.

34:05.669 --> 34:07.330
I wish you'd wear it more often.

34:07.421 --> 34:10.879
- All right, that's enough
flaccid dancing.

34:10.966 --> 34:13.548
Thank you very much.

34:13.636 --> 34:16.378
- Okay, then,
let's play a board game.

34:16.472 --> 34:19.054
- Ugh. There is so much to do.
There's fencing.

34:19.141 --> 34:21.848
There's stock car racing,
falconry.

34:21.936 --> 34:22.925
And Audrey likes...

34:24.480 --> 34:26.937
- "Game of Life".

34:40.788 --> 34:43.074
- Don't touch me.
I'm ticklish.

34:43.165 --> 34:44.826
- I know--
(grunts)

34:44.917 --> 34:48.205
- (laughing)

34:48.295 --> 34:50.672
Don't. Stop.

34:50.756 --> 34:52.917
I'll burn this cabin down.

34:53.008 --> 34:55.090
Nathan, stop it.

34:55.177 --> 34:56.337
Nathan, stop.
- Parker.

34:56.428 --> 34:59.215
Parker.
- Please, no, stop.

34:59.306 --> 35:01.513
Nathan, stop.
- Parker.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.589
- Yeah.

35:02.685 --> 35:04.175
- Audrey.

35:04.270 --> 35:06.261
- Yeah.
- It's working.

35:06.355 --> 35:08.391
- Yeah.
- What I'm doing, it's working.

35:08.482 --> 35:12.600
- Yes. Treat Mara like you treat
me.

35:12.695 --> 35:14.231
All right?
It helps me fight her.

35:14.321 --> 35:16.482
- Okay.
- Oh. Oh, Nathan.

35:16.573 --> 35:17.608
- Yeah?

35:17.700 --> 35:19.816
- You need to keep me here,
please.

35:19.910 --> 35:22.617
- I want to keep you here.
- l-- I can't die inside of her.

35:22.705 --> 35:24.991
- I want to keep you.
How do I keep you?

35:25.082 --> 35:29.951
- Mara-- Mara, she--
she has, um...

35:30.045 --> 35:32.036
- She-- she what?
- She has a...

35:32.131 --> 35:33.871
- What?
- (groans)

35:33.966 --> 35:35.706
- Parker.
Audrey, stay here.

35:35.801 --> 35:38.793
Mara has what? What?
You-- you need this jacket?

35:40.097 --> 35:43.180
Parker, don't go. Don't--
(door opens)

35:44.977 --> 35:45.966
(door closes)

35:47.104 --> 35:49.265
- What the hell
is going on here?

35:50.858 --> 35:52.064
- Duke, what do you want?

35:52.151 --> 35:54.358
- I can't stall for you anymore,
Nathan.

35:56.238 --> 35:59.275
What-- what-- what is this?

35:59.366 --> 36:02.483
I mean, you two look like
you're on your honeymoon.

36:02.578 --> 36:04.068
- Welcome to the party.

36:04.163 --> 36:06.779
You already look like
you're hungover.

36:12.921 --> 36:14.832
- You have no idea what you've
done.

36:16.759 --> 36:18.340
I had a plan.

36:18.427 --> 36:20.509
- Well, please tell me,
what is the plan?

36:20.596 --> 36:22.257
- He doesn't have a plan.

36:22.348 --> 36:23.884
- I know what it looks like.
- No, you don't.

36:23.974 --> 36:25.180
You don't know
what it looks like at all.

36:25.267 --> 36:26.928
- Audrey is still in there.
Mara doesn't know it.

36:27.019 --> 36:28.975
- There are things happening
here that are bigger than you.

36:29.063 --> 36:30.849
- We just have to treat her like
Audrey.

36:30.939 --> 36:32.475
- What?

36:37.154 --> 36:38.940
Damn it, Nathan.

36:39.031 --> 36:41.898
I stuck my neck out for you.

36:43.619 --> 36:45.234
(coughing)

36:47.664 --> 36:50.622
(breathes heavily)

36:52.294 --> 36:54.751
- Is your head about to pop off?

37:03.097 --> 37:06.260
- Why don't you tell me?
- I don't know.

37:06.350 --> 37:08.386
I thought you'd be dead already.

37:08.477 --> 37:10.559
You were on the doorstep
in the cave.

37:10.646 --> 37:12.682
- (clicks tongue)
Sorry to disappoint.

37:12.773 --> 37:14.638
- When did you start feeling
better?

37:14.733 --> 37:15.722
- (scoffs)

37:16.819 --> 37:19.356
(chuckles)

37:19.446 --> 37:22.062
All right.
I'll play along.

37:25.160 --> 37:29.073
It was when I let out
some kind of denial trouble.

37:29.164 --> 37:32.031
No, it wasn't pretty.
There were monkeys.

37:32.126 --> 37:35.368
- All right,
I think you're overloaded.

37:35.462 --> 37:37.202
Maybe I can help you, Duke.

37:37.297 --> 37:39.208
- Why would you do that
for him, Mara?

37:39.299 --> 37:40.630
- Because he could explode.

37:42.177 --> 37:44.668
- (groans)

37:47.099 --> 37:50.136
- If you were gonna help Duke,
what would you do?

37:51.186 --> 37:53.347
- I would get him
to release a Trouble,

37:53.439 --> 37:55.475
and it would take away
some of the pressure,

37:55.566 --> 37:56.931
keep him from exploding.

37:57.025 --> 37:58.936
- Then we'd have a new Trouble.

37:59.027 --> 38:00.608
- Yeah, it'd be an easy one.

38:00.696 --> 38:03.358
It would be something
you could manage.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.612
- Which one?

38:07.703 --> 38:08.943
- I'm not sure.

38:09.037 --> 38:11.699
I would need a list
of all of the curses

38:11.790 --> 38:15.578
that the Crocker family
has "taken care of."

38:15.669 --> 38:18.957
- (groaning)

38:20.340 --> 38:21.671
(breathing heavily)

38:21.758 --> 38:23.134
- (humming)

38:23.218 --> 38:26.426
(laughing)

38:26.513 --> 38:29.596
- They're all in my
grandfather's book.

38:30.726 --> 38:31.715
(sighs)

38:33.353 --> 38:35.890
I buried it...

38:38.066 --> 38:39.442
(sighs)

38:39.526 --> 38:40.811
with my brother.

38:40.903 --> 38:43.235
- Can't you just think of one?

38:43.322 --> 38:46.655
- Sorry, Nathan, I'm having
a hard time focusing right now.

38:46.742 --> 38:49.654
(coughing)

38:54.082 --> 38:56.414
- Well, it looks like Duke is
out.

38:57.628 --> 38:59.835
He's not gonna make it
past the porch.

38:59.922 --> 39:02.083
- (groans)

39:02.174 --> 39:04.165
- So what's it gonna be?

39:04.259 --> 39:06.250
Are you gonna grab a shovel,

39:06.345 --> 39:08.256
or are you going
to indulge yourself

39:08.347 --> 39:11.965
in your little tickle fixation
and watch your friend die?

39:23.904 --> 39:26.441
- Just find the damn book,
Nathan.

39:30.953 --> 39:33.035
(breathing heavily)

39:40.462 --> 39:41.451
- We're not done.

39:41.547 --> 39:42.912
(door opens)

39:45.968 --> 39:48.880
- (breathing heavily)

39:52.432 --> 39:54.172
Audrey, I'd do anything you need
me to.

39:54.268 --> 39:56.850
I'd hunt down your past...

39:58.647 --> 40:00.888
...and fight your future.

40:07.823 --> 40:10.906
- (chuckles)

40:25.549 --> 40:26.834
- Audrey...

40:26.925 --> 40:30.213
- Why?
Are you feeling unlucky?

40:30.304 --> 40:34.172
- (sighs)

40:34.266 --> 40:35.847
Nathan's not back yet.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.721
- Scavenger hunts
take a long time.

40:38.812 --> 40:40.768
- Are you really gonna help me

40:40.856 --> 40:42.721
release a Trouble
that won't kill people?

40:42.816 --> 40:45.933
- I'm the only one who can.

40:46.028 --> 40:49.737
The only one who can guide you
to the right Trouble to release.

40:50.824 --> 40:52.234
It's simple, really.

40:52.326 --> 40:54.112
One, we pick a Trouble.

40:54.202 --> 40:59.367
Two, my touch connects you
with that specific Trouble,

40:59.458 --> 41:01.369
my creation.

41:02.878 --> 41:07.247
And then you bleed all over the
floor.

41:07.341 --> 41:09.582
Just don't absorb it.

41:09.676 --> 41:12.383
- So you're saying that
I need you if I want to live.

41:14.056 --> 41:16.638
Well, isn't that convenient?

41:16.725 --> 41:18.181
- You're nothing like Nathan.

41:18.268 --> 41:21.806
- (coughs, breathing heavily)

41:21.897 --> 41:27.517
- You have a darkness
inside of you

41:27.611 --> 41:31.149
that's not connected with the
Troubles.

41:31.239 --> 41:34.982
I'm not surprised
why you and Audrey

41:35.077 --> 41:38.319
had your little dalliance in
Colorado.

41:38.413 --> 41:39.994
- That is none
of your business.

41:40.082 --> 41:43.370
- Oh, and her impulse to kiss
YOU,

41:43.460 --> 41:48.420
I wonder if a little bit of that
wasn't from me.

41:51.426 --> 41:53.132
- Get away from me.

41:53.220 --> 41:56.303
- Well, you are just no fun.

41:56.390 --> 41:58.631
And you're about
to go kaboom.

41:58.725 --> 42:01.262
So we're running out of time.

42:02.604 --> 42:05.562
- (groaning)

42:07.609 --> 42:09.474
(coughs)

42:15.450 --> 42:16.485
All right, do it.

42:17.619 --> 42:19.029
Do it now.

42:22.332 --> 42:25.415
- Mara...
I've been looking for you.

42:29.464 --> 42:29.498
J‘J‘

42:29.506 --> 42:33.374
J‘J‘
