WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.071
Okay, guys,
glasses up.

00:03.137 --> 00:05.039
To the whole
Monkey Fist team.

00:05.106 --> 00:07.208
Goody, Mott,
welcome aboard.
Yeah.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.009
We had a great month,
we got new accounts,

00:09.077 --> 00:10.411
and Kevin and I just wanted
to thank you.

00:10.478 --> 00:11.812
Hear, hear.
Monkey Fist.

00:11.879 --> 00:13.081
Hold up, hold up.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.482
You know,
three months ago,

00:14.548 --> 00:16.450
when I got the original vision
for the com...

00:16.517 --> 00:18.686
Oh, boy.
Here we go.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.289
Yeah, it's,
it's called a toast, okay?
Okay.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.691
You know,
when I came up with the idea

00:23.757 --> 00:25.593
for the name Monkey Fist,

00:25.659 --> 00:28.296
I had no idea the meaning
it would have today.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.730
Much like a fist,

00:29.797 --> 00:32.166
which is comprised of
five fingers, all right,

00:32.233 --> 00:33.567
I want you to look around
this table

00:33.634 --> 00:35.736
and see how many people
we have here.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.208
Whoa!
Right? That's right.

00:40.274 --> 00:43.077
Five of us,
five fingers in a fist.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.912
That's because
we're a team, okay?

00:44.978 --> 00:46.580
I mean, obviously,
I would be the thumb

00:46.647 --> 00:48.416
'cause I kind of
hold us together, right?

00:48.482 --> 00:50.451
Yes, and also 'cause you're
the shortest and the fattest.

00:50.518 --> 00:51.685
(LAUGHS)

00:51.752 --> 00:52.820
Come on.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.355
All right.

00:56.324 --> 00:58.626
Continuing, okay?
All righty.

00:58.692 --> 01:01.462
Now, look, we have one goal
together, and that is to be

01:01.529 --> 01:04.398
the best security
company in the
Greater Massapequa area.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.200
Much like
the fist of a chimp,

01:06.267 --> 01:08.302
we are small,
but we are mighty.

01:08.369 --> 01:09.870
And what we...
Food's here.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.439
Okay, uh...we're small.

01:11.505 --> 01:14.508
Go, Monkeys.
You guys are great.
Let's eat.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.009
Actually, if you guys
want to help,

01:16.076 --> 01:18.246
there's a 4-foot hero
and a sheet cake in the car.

01:18.312 --> 01:19.447
Gotcha.
On it.

01:19.513 --> 01:20.881
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.383
Oh. I'm gonna grab my camera
for social media.

01:22.450 --> 01:23.984
But we're not on
social media.

01:24.051 --> 01:25.853
Yet. Oh!
Oh!

01:25.919 --> 01:27.255
Oh! I almost forgot,

01:27.321 --> 01:30.158
my world-famous
three-cheese fondue.

01:30.224 --> 01:33.494
It's so "Gouda,"
you "ricotta" try it.

01:34.628 --> 01:35.529
Painful.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.964
It's not painful.
Yeah, it is.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.566
All right, here we go.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.501
Whew!
That thing is hot!

01:40.568 --> 01:42.303
Mr. Gable,
potholders if it's hot.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.937
No, no, no.
I don't need potholders.

01:44.004 --> 01:45.105
Get away from me, buddy.
Okay.

01:45.173 --> 01:46.840
All right.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.676
Oh! I should have taken
the potholders!
I don't have it!

01:52.446 --> 01:53.514
Ugh!

01:53.581 --> 01:55.416
I'll go
and get some rags.
Yeah.

01:56.284 --> 01:57.951
Oh, careful, Rootger.

01:58.018 --> 01:59.420
Oh, yeah.
Say "Cheese."

02:00.188 --> 02:01.455
(GROANS)

02:01.522 --> 02:04.091
Rootger! You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.393
Here, come on, buddy.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.727
Hey, what happened?
Are you all right?

02:06.794 --> 02:08.162
It's nothing.
No, it's totally my fault.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.763
Oh, it's okay.
Are you all right?

02:09.830 --> 02:11.565
You know what, Chale,
do me a favor.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.767
Let's get him to the doctor
and get him checked out.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.237
Oh, that's not necessary.
I just dented my melon.

02:16.304 --> 02:18.439
Even still,
let's just get him there.

02:18.506 --> 02:19.773
I want to get him
checked out.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.342
Okay.
You're a good friend, Gable.

02:21.409 --> 02:22.843
Yeah. All right, buddy.
(GROANS)

02:22.910 --> 02:24.578
That is totally my fault.

02:25.379 --> 02:26.880
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

02:27.515 --> 02:28.582
Man.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.822
You're thinking about dipping
the bread in that, aren't ya?

02:38.526 --> 02:40.228
No, I'm not.
I'm just...

02:41.495 --> 02:43.331
Just do it already!

02:45.233 --> 02:49.670
* I am not your
ordinary guy *

02:51.372 --> 02:53.073
Hey.
How's he doing?

02:53.140 --> 02:54.275
No broken bones.

02:54.342 --> 02:57.010
Knew it.
The guy's made of brick.

02:57.077 --> 03:00.047
The doctor said he might want
to get an MRI tomorrow,

03:00.113 --> 03:01.515
but otherwise,
he is fine.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.916
Well,
I'm glad he's okay,

03:02.983 --> 03:04.552
'cause that could have been
a nasty lawsuit.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.420
No, Rootger's part of
the Monkey Fist family.

03:06.487 --> 03:10.090
Well, legally speaking,
he's an employee
who got hurt at work,

03:10.157 --> 03:11.459
and you're totally liable.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.926
He would never sue us.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.628
Plus, we have insurance.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.665
Um...

03:17.731 --> 03:19.300
No, no.
We have insurance?

03:19.367 --> 03:21.602
Um, okay,
in the chaos of moving in

03:21.669 --> 03:23.070
and starting up
the business...

03:23.136 --> 03:24.305
Oh, no, no, no, no.

03:24.372 --> 03:25.873
In the chaos,

03:25.939 --> 03:29.443
I may have forgotten to
purchase liability insurance.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.713
I started
the paperwork,

03:32.780 --> 03:35.383
and then I started dating
Carlos from State Farm,

03:35.449 --> 03:37.518
and we broke up,
and then it got awkward,

03:37.585 --> 03:39.019
and we were thinking about
getting back together...

03:39.086 --> 03:41.622
Anyway, we do not have
insurance, so sue me!

03:44.858 --> 03:46.994
Okay, I'm only
a second-year law student.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.161
I'm not a lawyer yet.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.464
Yeah, but you know
your stuff.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.533
Okay, well, the previous owner
had 10 years

03:52.600 --> 03:54.234
to ask you
to move the fence,

03:54.302 --> 03:56.470
so, technically,
under the laws of
adverse possession,

03:56.537 --> 03:57.805
the property is yours.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.006
What?
Ohh!

03:59.072 --> 04:00.140
(BOTH LAUGH)

04:00.207 --> 04:01.709
Okay, I'm still not
a lawyer yet,

04:01.775 --> 04:03.477
but, according to
the State of New York,

04:03.544 --> 04:06.280
that 6-inch strip of land
now belongs to you.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.715
(LAUGHS)

04:08.982 --> 04:11.285
Kendra, I love you.
You totally made my day.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.621
Thanks for the advice.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.291
Ooh!
Did you see that?

04:17.358 --> 04:18.926
He just left you $20.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.694
I know.
He didn't have to do that.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.364
Well, you did just save him
an expensive trip

04:23.431 --> 04:25.265
to a real lawyer.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.435
Sorry.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.972
You know,
it's like you woke up
under a money tree

04:32.039 --> 04:34.575
and someone's putting
$20 leaves in your lap.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.209
What are you
talking about?

04:36.276 --> 04:38.712
Do you know how many people
want cheap legal advice? Tons.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.982
(CHUCKLES)
Well, this is a restaurant.
It's not a law firm.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.717
I read an article once
about this guy

04:43.784 --> 04:45.152
who was giving
cheap legal advice

04:45.218 --> 04:47.120
at a hot dog stand
in California.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.956
Lines around the block.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.459
Around the block!

04:54.862 --> 04:55.929
Hey.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.031
Hey, so, I called
the insurance company.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.667
We are covered.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.835
Great.
Starting now.

05:04.204 --> 05:08.742
Okay, so if somebody slips
in hot cheese today,
we're good.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.878
Okay, I will give you that.
I deserve it.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.980
I am just worried about
his whole suing us.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.582
He's not gonna sue us.
Believe me.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.016
I know him, all right?

05:16.083 --> 05:18.251
Really?
Okay. How well?

05:18.318 --> 05:19.587
Very well.
I know him very well.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.154
He's my neighbor,
all right?

05:21.221 --> 05:22.790
He's...Dutch.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.325
Lot of stuff,
lot of stuff.

05:25.393 --> 05:26.427
Yeah.
Yeah?

05:26.494 --> 05:28.529
What's his last name?

05:28.596 --> 05:31.231
You know, I don't like
to pry into his personal
affairs, okay?

05:31.298 --> 05:32.633
Believe me,
he's gonna be fine.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.034
We're gonna be fine.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.736
He's gonna come through
that door any minute

05:35.803 --> 05:37.505
with a box of doughnuts,
healthy as a horse, okay?

05:37.571 --> 05:39.206
ROOTGER: Hello, hello.
There he is, all right?

05:39.272 --> 05:41.008
What'd I say, huh?

05:41.074 --> 05:42.376
Hey...

05:42.443 --> 05:44.578
Sorry I'm late.
I had an MRI this morning.

05:45.245 --> 05:47.214
Not good.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.082
I brought doughnuts.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.458
I was half right.

06:04.364 --> 06:08.035
What is,
what is he doing?
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

06:08.101 --> 06:10.370
Oh, he's taking pictures
for Facebook.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.605
Facebook? Pfft.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.641
That's exactly
where he fell.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.676
He is documenting
the scene.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.845
No, he's not.
Wait a second.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.781
He's taking pictures
of the Crock-Pot.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.282
You think that's for, like,
a lawsuit or something?

06:22.349 --> 06:24.685
No, no, he's just taking
a picture of the Crock-Pot

06:24.752 --> 06:26.420
'cause he wants one
just like it.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.855
Yes,
it's for the lawsuit.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.089
Rootger? Honey?

06:29.156 --> 06:30.891
Why are you taking a picture
of the Crock-Pot?

06:30.958 --> 06:32.259
Is it a suspect?

06:32.325 --> 06:34.628
(LAUGHS)

06:34.695 --> 06:38.165
I told you,
it's for Facebook,
social media.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.702
Who puts pictures of a
Crock-Pot on Facebook?

06:41.769 --> 06:43.804
Actually, I did once.
I made chili.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.840
Got over 100 likes.
I mean...

06:46.907 --> 06:49.943
One guy said he hated it,
but he was a jealous idiot.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.311
Blocked his ass.

06:51.378 --> 06:53.180
Okay, enough about the...

06:53.246 --> 06:55.148
Hey, if he did come
after us,

06:55.215 --> 06:56.684
would it just be, like,
a business thing

06:56.750 --> 06:59.019
or could it affect
my personal wealth?

06:59.086 --> 07:02.089
He could go after
your stock options and assets.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.558
If I were you,
I would move your yacht

07:04.625 --> 07:07.260
into international waters
immediately.

07:07.327 --> 07:09.062
Okay, fine.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.464
How about this?

07:10.531 --> 07:11.865
We just, we tell him

07:11.932 --> 07:13.601
we're gonna do, like,
an employee review

07:13.667 --> 07:15.202
and we call him in here
and get him to talk.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.604
Yes. Good idea.
All right?

07:16.670 --> 07:17.871
Yes. Good, okay.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.907
Uh, Rootger?
Rootger.

07:19.973 --> 07:23.143
Rootger, uh, could we just
see you one second, please?

07:31.251 --> 07:32.686
It's very difficult.
Yeah.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.188
(GROANS)
Yeah...okay.

07:37.491 --> 07:40.694
First off, we want to
just thank you for
your service here.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.696
Yes, thank you very much.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.464
And what we're doing now

07:44.532 --> 07:46.233
is we're basically
just gonna do, like...

07:46.299 --> 07:49.503
what we do, it's our six-week
employee review, you know?

07:49.570 --> 07:51.639
Oh. In Holland,
it's usually six months.

07:51.705 --> 07:54.241
Oh! Well,
welcome to America, buddy.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.375
(CHUCKLES)

07:55.442 --> 07:56.644
Lot of red tape.
KEVIN: Yeah.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.679
So, um,
how would you describe

07:58.746 --> 08:01.649
your experience
here at Monkey Fist?

08:01.715 --> 08:05.052
Excellent. I like
working here very much.

08:05.118 --> 08:09.256
Mm-hmm. But is there anything
that, uh, bothers you?

08:09.322 --> 08:11.224
Oh,
there's this one thing,

08:11.291 --> 08:13.060
but, you know,
I don't want to upset anyone.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.795
No, Rootger, look,
this is a safe place.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.664
You can say
whatever you want, okay?

08:16.730 --> 08:19.767
Okay, I wish
when we order lunch,

08:19.833 --> 08:21.569
you would consider
vegetarian options.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.136
No! No way! No! No!

08:23.203 --> 08:24.905
Then I'm hungry again
by 3:00.
Okay. All right.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.840
And it doesn't fulfill me.
Can we focus? Focus, focus.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.241
Focus.
But I'm hungry.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.111
Mm. Okay.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.412
So, Rootger,

08:32.479 --> 08:35.382
is there anything else
that you want to talk about?

08:35.448 --> 08:36.950
No, everything's great.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.787
I mean, except for that
hideous fall I took yesterday.

08:39.853 --> 08:43.256
Okay, well, "hideous"
is a strong word, you know.

08:43.323 --> 08:46.760
I mean, I see it more of,
like, a "Whoops!
I fell. My bad."

08:46.827 --> 08:49.697
Yes, I guess
what we really
want to know is,

08:49.763 --> 08:52.700
where do you see yourself
in the near future?

08:52.766 --> 08:53.834
That's a good question.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.803
Oh, funny you say that.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.638
Lately,
I've been thinking,

08:57.705 --> 09:00.974
"What does the future hold
for Rootger Vanderkamp?"

09:01.041 --> 09:02.409
"Vanderkamp."

09:02.475 --> 09:04.244
Nice.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.546
And, uh,
and what's the answer?

09:06.614 --> 09:08.248
Well, I want to work hard

09:08.315 --> 09:11.118
and take advantage of every
opportunity that comes my way.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.386
Oh, yeah.
"Take advantage." Okay.

09:13.453 --> 09:16.523
Well, okay, I think we got
everything that we needed.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.925
Great.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.228
(GROANING)

09:21.294 --> 09:23.563
This might be easier.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.737
Did you hear that?

09:29.803 --> 09:31.639
Vegetarian?
It's not happening.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.076
I can't
take people's money.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.878
I mean, I'm not even
a lawyer yet.

09:37.945 --> 09:41.148
Oh, the sign says that,
in the fine print.

09:41.214 --> 09:44.417
And, darling,
it's not about the money.

09:44.484 --> 09:47.354
It is about giving a voice
to the voiceless.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.456
As long as
they buy pizza.

09:49.522 --> 09:50.991
Yeah, yeah,
all you got to do is

09:51.058 --> 09:53.426
sprinkle a little legal
knowledge to your fellow man

09:53.493 --> 09:56.296
and rake in your tips.

09:56.363 --> 09:59.599
All right, fine!
But just keep it low-key.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.902
Absolutely.
Mwah!

10:03.971 --> 10:06.273
All right, who's up?

10:06.339 --> 10:08.842
All right, pal,
you got two minutes, okay?

10:08.909 --> 10:10.077
When you hear this...
(BELL DINGS)

10:10.143 --> 10:12.112
...session's over,
all right?

10:12.179 --> 10:15.282
You move down the line,
you collect your slice
from the pale-lookin' Brit.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.055
All right. So,
what did you guys find out?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.523
Rootger seeing
a lawyer?

10:23.590 --> 10:25.659
Well, we followed him
all morning.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.294
Yep, male subject
observed

10:27.360 --> 10:30.597
entering a medical facility
at 0900 hours.

10:30.664 --> 10:33.834
Mott, just give it to me
in regular talk, all right?
You're not in court.

10:33.901 --> 10:37.337
All right, you want to do it
the boring way.

10:37.404 --> 10:40.640
After that, he ate breakfast
at a Dutch restaurant.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.442
There was a sign outside
that said

10:42.509 --> 10:46.013
"Wooden Shoe Rather Be Eating
Stroop Waffles?"

10:46.079 --> 10:47.080
(CHUCKLES)

10:47.147 --> 10:48.816
What?
I didn't get it, either.

10:48.882 --> 10:52.352
"Wooden shoe," wooden shoes
are famous in Holland.

10:52.419 --> 10:53.520
Oh!

10:53.586 --> 10:55.088
(LAUGHTER)

10:55.155 --> 10:56.556
That's funny!

10:56.623 --> 10:58.892
Okay, okay.
Can we focus?

10:58.959 --> 11:00.127
Sorry.

11:00.193 --> 11:03.330
Okay, uh, then he went
to an electronics store,

11:03.396 --> 11:04.631
shopping for TVs.

11:04.698 --> 11:07.200
Oh! He's already spending
your money.

11:07.267 --> 11:10.370
Then we tracked him
to this place in Mineola.

11:11.604 --> 11:14.708
"Roger Dantley,
Esquire."

11:14.775 --> 11:15.909
Esquire.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.911
That's a men's magazine.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.848
Seriously?

11:20.914 --> 11:22.449
"Esquire" means "lawyer."

11:22.515 --> 11:25.085
Yes, but Esquire is also
a men's magazine.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.790
Good luck
with the inheritance.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.359
And I'm really sorry
about your stepmom.

11:32.425 --> 11:36.129
(BELL DINGS)
Okay, move it along.
Enjoy your slice.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.133
Hey, whatever you guys
are doing, keep it up.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.003
This is the best lunch hour
I've had in years!

11:44.471 --> 11:47.307
Hey, babe, I don't know
if I can keep doing this.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.441
I'm really tired.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.744
What are you talking about?
You're doing great!

11:50.811 --> 11:52.679
And these people
need you.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.882
Plus,
look at the chedda.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.151
Well, yeah, that's great,
but, I mean,

11:58.218 --> 12:00.988
between waiting tables and
giving advice, I'm exhausted.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.689
I don't even know
what I'm saying half the time.

12:02.756 --> 12:05.658
Oh, it doesn't matter,
so long as it
sounds legal-ish.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.360
(CHUCKLES)

12:07.427 --> 12:08.896
Take a break.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.933
Whoa.
Where's she going?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.367
She's just a bit tired.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.904
Is she gonna be
a problem?

12:16.970 --> 12:18.371
'Cause I'll tell you,
there are law students

12:18.438 --> 12:22.009
getting off of buses
every day in this town.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.411
Okay, okay, remember,
we stick to the plan.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.246
Yeah, the plan
is you should've
bought insurance.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.882
Yes, and the other plan is not
to dump cheese on the floor.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.051
Okay, we know the plan,
all right?

12:31.118 --> 12:34.621
We butter him up, we get him
to admit he hired a lawyer,

12:34.687 --> 12:36.857
and then we sweet-talk him
into not suing us, okay?

12:36.924 --> 12:38.391
Yep. Let's go.
All right, come on.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.361
Hey, there he is!
Looking good!

12:41.428 --> 12:43.630
Yeah, See?
I told you he'd be working.

12:43.696 --> 12:45.032
This guy never stops.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.366
Oh, no, he's an animal.
Yeah. Yeah.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.301
Actually, I stop at 5:00
every day.

12:48.368 --> 12:51.538
Yes, but up until then,
animal, right?
Yeah.

12:51.604 --> 12:52.906
(BOTH LAUGH)

12:52.973 --> 12:54.875
Nonstop.
He's an animal.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.912
Anyway, um, Rootger,
we have something

12:58.979 --> 13:00.380
that we would like
to give to you.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.949
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Look at that right there.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.583
What is this?

13:03.650 --> 13:04.818
(GASPS)

13:04.885 --> 13:06.920
A gold little monkey
on a ribbon!

13:06.987 --> 13:09.122
That's for
your extraordinary bravery.

13:09.189 --> 13:12.292
And, more importantly,
loyalty.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.360
Ohh!

13:13.426 --> 13:15.896
We call it
the Order of the Monkey.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.364
And you're
the first recipient.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.266
I don't even have
one of those.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.834
Oh, wow.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.702
Here,
let me pin it on you.

13:22.769 --> 13:24.104
Okay.
Yeah, do it up.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.406
There we go.
Look at that.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.640
Wow!

13:27.707 --> 13:29.176
Oh, guys,
I'm so honored.

13:29.242 --> 13:32.179
If I could lift my arms,
I would hug the both of you.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.480
Oh. (LAUGHS)

13:33.546 --> 13:36.049
Okay, he's not letting
that go, is he?
Mmm.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.985
Yeah, a funny thing
happened today.

13:38.051 --> 13:41.154
I saw somebody
who looked just like you.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.622
Where was that?
Was that Mineola?

13:42.689 --> 13:44.491
Mineola, yes!
Mineola.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.393
Were you in Mineola?

13:46.459 --> 13:47.928
Mineola? No.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.296
You sure?

13:49.362 --> 13:50.964
Yeah, I'm sure.
I know where I was today.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.901
And it was not Mineola.
I hate Mineola.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.335
Hmm.
Really?

13:55.402 --> 13:57.437
Why would anybody hate
Mineola? I mean, right?

13:57.504 --> 13:59.739
There's good things there.
There's, like, delis,
ice cream shops...

13:59.806 --> 14:01.374
they got lawyers.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.577
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.279
I should
go back to work.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.554
Wow, he lied
right to our face.

14:14.621 --> 14:15.989
He is definitely suing us.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.091
He made a mockery
of the Order of the Monkey.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.360
Really?

14:24.097 --> 14:25.565
I'm worried
about Rootger.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.935
Well, yeah. Did you hear
his head hit the floor?

14:28.001 --> 14:30.670
Sounded like a burrito
hit the side of a van.

14:30.737 --> 14:33.106
Not that. I'm talking about
all the legal stuff.

14:33.173 --> 14:37.010
Uh, just so you know,
you have 30 seconds left.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.678
But you know what?
You're family.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.013
I can reset the timer.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.582
So, what do I do?

14:42.649 --> 14:45.252
Well, if you can get him
to sign a liability waiver,

14:45.318 --> 14:47.187
then you're pretty much
indemnified.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.322
That's a good thing, right?
Yes. Yeah.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.324
That means that he gives up
his right to sue you.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.592
Okay, good.
How do I get one of those?

14:52.659 --> 14:54.161
Oh, well,
there's templates online.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.229
I can just print one out
for you.
Okay.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.564
FYI.

14:57.630 --> 15:00.400
The printing is not normally
included with the slice.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.671
But you are not normal.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.042
All right,
so, if I get the paper,

15:09.109 --> 15:10.343
then how do I get him
to sign it?

15:10.410 --> 15:11.945
Okay, well, see,
that's the hard part,

15:12.012 --> 15:13.780
because legally,
he doesn't have to.

15:13.846 --> 15:17.184
But we advise using clear
lines of communication
when possible.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.551
Yeah,
I'm gonna bribe him.

15:18.618 --> 15:19.686
Okay,
I didn't hear that.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.054
Yeah.

15:22.722 --> 15:25.025
You're very kind,
but what is this for?

15:25.092 --> 15:28.061
Well, the Order of the
Monkey medal always
comes with a prize.

15:28.128 --> 15:31.598
It's either a, uh, TV
or a mini bike.

15:31.664 --> 15:32.966
Oh, I love mini bikes.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.301
Okay, but you got a TV.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.103
Oh, this is wonderful.
Yeah.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.071
Yeah, thank you very much.
You're welcome.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.107
You know what we should
probably do?

15:40.173 --> 15:42.175
You know, maybe we should sign
those Monkey Fist papers
now that we're here.

15:42.242 --> 15:45.112
Oh! Um, good idea.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.947
I hope I brought them.
(CHUCKLES)

15:48.015 --> 15:50.083
Oh. I did.
Oh, good. Yeah.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.052
I'll sign mine
right now.
Okay.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.521
Yeah, hey,
and I'll witness for you,

15:54.587 --> 15:57.024
and then I'll sign mine,
and then you can
witness for me.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.325
Absolutely!
There you go.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.627
Here we are.
Here we go.

16:00.693 --> 16:01.928
Okay.
Yeah.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.330
And then
I'll witness.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.232
And then I'll do mine,
and then you witness.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.933
Okay. Here we go.
VANESSA: Yeah.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.268
What is this?

16:08.335 --> 16:11.471
Oh, this is just a, uh,
liability release form,

16:11.538 --> 16:13.806
just for Monkey Fist
standard stuff.
Yeah.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.808
Just gonna need your Soc
and your sig right there.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.611
Uh-huh. I mean,
mine was almost fun to sign.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.013
Yeah.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.149
I don't think I can.
Why not?

16:22.215 --> 16:24.384
Well, I need my lawyer
to go over this first.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.053
I thought
you didn't have a lawyer.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.655
I didn't, but now...

16:28.721 --> 16:32.159
You know what? I'm being rude.
Let me go get us some tea.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.027
(GROANS)

16:37.564 --> 16:39.666
Did you see that?
Soon as he saw that form,

16:39.732 --> 16:42.102
he started sweating
like a possum on the beach.

16:42.902 --> 16:44.071
What do we do now?

16:44.137 --> 16:46.273
What we do now is
we take the gloves off.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.707
You start filming me.
Filming what?

16:47.774 --> 16:50.043
Those stairs
and me coming down them.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.878
What if I was to fall down
those stairs?

16:51.944 --> 16:55.282
Yes.
He has a slip-and-fall on us,
we have one on him.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.816
What's up? Double, double.
"What's up?"

16:56.883 --> 16:58.318
That's right, sister.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.820
Here we go.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.555
Oh.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.558
I got us some tea,
but also if you want a nice,
cold beer,

17:05.625 --> 17:06.793
I have that, too.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.128
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.996
I don't want to impair
myself, you know.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.231
(CHUCKLES)

17:11.298 --> 17:13.300
I'm completely free
of alcohol.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.138
Mmm!

17:18.205 --> 17:20.940
This cheese is interesting.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.609
Yeah, it's nagelkaas.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.744
You either love it
or you hate it.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.547
Well, I love it.

17:29.516 --> 17:33.086
Anyway, I tried some, boy,
and it got me in the
wrong way.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.454
You know what it is?
I'm lactose-intolerant.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.055
And, like,
it had a thing.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.824
And, uh,
I just need a bathroom,

17:37.890 --> 17:39.626
like, a private bathroom.
It's running through me.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.694
Okay. Go upstairs
on the right.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.163
Thanks. Yeah.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.098
(WHISPERS) Showtime.

17:49.936 --> 17:53.606
Oh, you sure have a
crapload of these things.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.476
Hummels. Yes.

17:56.543 --> 17:59.078
My tante and I have been
collecting them for years.

17:59.146 --> 18:01.381
They mean the world to us.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.250
Much like you and Kevin.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.885
Oh.
You've been very kind
to me.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.454
Thank you, Rootger.

18:07.520 --> 18:11.424
Yeah, I mean, look,
the medal, now the TV.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.129
I need to tell you
something.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.265
What?

18:18.331 --> 18:19.632
The other day,
when you asked me

18:19.699 --> 18:21.534
if I was seeing
a lawyer...

18:22.202 --> 18:23.570
I lied.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.173
Truth is, I am.

18:26.239 --> 18:28.040
You did see me in Mineola.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.243
Oh, and I love Mineola.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.512
I knew it.

18:32.579 --> 18:33.913
It's an immigration lawyer,
you know.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.749
I'm having some issues
with my citizenship.

18:36.816 --> 18:39.252
And I was afraid
you would fire me.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.188
Wait. Wait.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.456
So you're
not gonna sue us?

18:44.123 --> 18:45.492
Sue you?

18:45.558 --> 18:47.260
(CHUCKLES)
You're my friends.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.429
You hired me
in my darkest hour.

18:49.496 --> 18:50.297
Oh!

18:50.363 --> 18:52.064
You help me to fly.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.801
Oh! Rootger!

18:55.535 --> 18:58.137
Honey, that is so sweet.

18:58.205 --> 18:59.506
KEVIN: Okay, coming down.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.073
Oh! No, no, no!
Kevin, wait!

19:01.140 --> 19:03.176
(GLASS SHATTERS)

19:15.288 --> 19:17.190
Okay, guys, we had
a strange couple days,

19:17.257 --> 19:19.125
you know,
we lost a few hummels,

19:19.192 --> 19:21.160
but we learned a lot
about trusting each other.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.795
So...to trust!

19:22.862 --> 19:24.264
ALL: Trust!
All right.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.733
And to say "Thank you"
for sponsoring
my citizenship,

19:26.799 --> 19:28.635
I bought nagelkaas
for everyone.

19:28.701 --> 19:32.639
Oh, no.
Not that crappy cheese?

19:32.705 --> 19:35.375
No, no, that one in my house
was expired.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.310
You know, that's why it tasted
like duck feet.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.711
Oh! Okay.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.480
Goody, do me a favor,
just grab the cheese.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.181
All right, you got it.
KEVIN: Okay.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.252
Oh! (GRUNTS)

19:45.318 --> 19:47.554
(GLASS SHATTERS, THUD)
Ooh!

19:48.588 --> 19:49.922
He hit his head
on the microwave.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.058
Do we have insurance?
Yeah, we're covered.

19:52.124 --> 19:53.560
Yes!

19:53.626 --> 19:56.829
* Don't want no sweet perfume

19:56.896 --> 20:00.500
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move

20:00.567 --> 20:03.069
* Do, do, do, do, do

20:03.135 --> 20:04.971
* Do, do, do, do

20:05.037 --> 20:07.740
* Oh, yeah

20:07.807 --> 20:10.677
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes

20:10.743 --> 20:13.246
* I just don't want no...
