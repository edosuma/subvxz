OH, HELLO JOHNNY.

07:29.067 --> 07:30.233
WHAT ?

07:30.267 --> 07:32.633
LOOK WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THIS KID.

07:35.233 --> 07:36.367
WOW.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.733
HONESTLY,
IT'S HUGE.

07:37.767 --> 07:40.400
IT'S A BIGGER PENIS THAN MINE,
HE'S GOT A BIGGER PENIS THAN ME.

07:40.433 --> 07:42.300
ISN'T THAT
HUGH'S KID ?

07:42.333 --> 07:44.700
"OY VEY MIA".

07:44.733 --> 07:46.633
LET'S JUST GO,
LET'S JUST GO.

07:46.667 --> 07:47.567
GO ?

07:47.600 --> 07:49.800
YEAH, IT'S
CIRCUS FREAK SHOW.

07:49.833 --> 07:50.800
IT'S CIRCUS FREAK SHOW.

07:50.833 --> 07:54.400
YOU KNOW WHAT,
CHERYL'S RIGHT, LET'S GO.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.100
WE GOT A FREAK SHOW HERE,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING ?

07:56.133 --> 07:58.100
PLEASE, LARRY,
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.767
GEE.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.533
SIT RIGHT THERE.

08:11.067 --> 08:12.333
ALRIGHT.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.867
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

08:18.900 --> 08:19.800
WHAT ?

08:19.833 --> 08:22.633
THEY STUFF YOU
IN LIKE SARDINES HERE.

08:22.667 --> 08:25.067
THE GUY DESERVES TO MAKE
A LIVING, YOU KNOW ?

08:25.100 --> 08:27.367
THIS IS GONNA BE A GREAT
LUNCH HERE, LOOK AT THIS.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.633
RELAX, MAN,
JUST RELAX.

08:28.667 --> 08:31.867
I CAN'T EVEN TALK,
YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING HERE.

08:31.900 --> 08:33.833
DIRECT IT
RIGHT TO ME.

08:33.867 --> 08:35.767
IT'S LIKE YOU GOTTA HAVE
A WHOLE WHISPER LUNCH,

08:35.800 --> 08:36.800
IT'S A WHISPER LUNCH.

08:36.833 --> 08:39.067
IT'S LIKE
THE MAFIA THING.

08:39.067 --> 08:41.667
( whispering )
I'm having a dental appointment
tomorrow at three.

08:44.433 --> 08:46.667
UM, HEY, I SPOKE
TO THE HUGH MELLON GUY.

08:46.700 --> 08:47.700
YOU SPOKE WITH HIM ?

08:47.733 --> 08:50.133
I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT
YOUR QUOTE, YOU KNOW,

08:50.167 --> 08:51.933
"THE BLANK FROM HELL."

08:51.967 --> 08:56.400
YOU KNOW, HE'S INTERESTED AND
HE'S GONNA TALK TO HIS PARTNER.

08:56.433 --> 08:57.667
REALLY ?

08:57.700 --> 09:00.367
YEAH, YOU MIGHT GET INTO,
YOU MIGHT GET INTO BARTLETT'S.

09:00.400 --> 09:03.067
NUMBER ONE THIS LUNCH
IS ON ME.

09:03.067 --> 09:05.633
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME, YOU KNOW,
I GET CREDIT FOR THIS THING.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.200
BUT THE RIGHT WAY.
ABSOLUTELY.

09:07.233 --> 09:10.067
SO HE'S LIKE,
HE ACTUALLY, HE, UH...

09:10.067 --> 09:13.100
HE'S POSITIVE ?

09:13.133 --> 09:15.967
I MEAN, DOES HE FEEL GOOD
ABOUT THAT IT'S ME ?

09:16.067 --> 09:19.633
HE ACTUALLY,
HE KNEW OF THE QUOTE,

09:19.667 --> 09:22.500
BUT HE DIDN'T REALLY
ATTRIBUTE IT TO YOU.

09:22.533 --> 09:23.700
HE JUST THOUGHT
THAT IT WAS...

09:23.733 --> 09:25.467
HE DIDN'T
ATTRIBUTE IT TO ME ?

09:25.500 --> 09:28.067
THAT REALLY PISSES ME OFF THAT
I DON'T GET CREDIT FOR THAT.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.400
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY,
I DON'T BLAME YOU.

09:29.433 --> 09:33.400
AND AT THE POOL PARTY
I TOLD HIM ABOUT YOUR SPECIAL.

09:33.433 --> 09:34.700
RIGHT.

09:34.733 --> 09:40.067
AND I INVITED HIM
TO THE HBO SCREENING
TOMORROW NIGHT.

09:40.100 --> 09:43.167
SO, HE'S GONNA COME
IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.500
NO, HEY, I'LL BE ABLE
TO MILK HIM A LITTLE BIT.

09:45.533 --> 09:47.067
YEAH.

09:47.067 --> 09:48.133
THANK YOU.

09:49.933 --> 09:51.367
NO, THAT'S COOL.

09:51.400 --> 09:55.467
HAVE YOU BEEN
GETTING ALL THIS ?

09:55.500 --> 09:57.067
YOU BEEN
GETTING ALL THIS ?

09:57.100 --> 09:58.833
I'M EATING
MY LUNCH.

10:01.867 --> 10:03.300
THIS IS THE LUNCH
FROM HELL.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.133
WHAT, WHAT
DID YOU SAY ?

10:05.167 --> 10:08.533
I'M SAYING THIS IS
THE LUNCH FROM HELL.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.900
WHERE'D YOU HEAR
THAT EXPRESSION ?

10:10.933 --> 10:12.633
GIRLFRIEND ?

10:12.667 --> 10:14.200
YOU SEE
WHAT I MEAN ?

10:14.233 --> 10:15.600
THIS KILLS ME.

10:21.133 --> 10:24.333
OKAY, GUYS, SO WHAT
HAPPENED AT ALSACE ?

10:24.367 --> 10:26.067
ALSACE S'IL VOUS PLAIT.

10:26.100 --> 10:27.433
ALSACE WHATEVER.

10:27.467 --> 10:30.633
HE DOESN'T WANT
TO WORK WITH US.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.867
I SAW THAT.

10:32.900 --> 10:35.100
WHAT DID YOU SEE ?

10:35.133 --> 10:37.867
I HAD A LITTLE PROBLEM
WITH THIS WOMAN AND HER HUSBAND

10:37.900 --> 10:39.167
WHO KIND OF CAME
AFTER ME AND...

10:39.200 --> 10:41.567
WELL, WHAT ABOUT TED'S GUY,
WHAT ABOUT JOSH ?

10:41.600 --> 10:44.667
JOSH COOKED A BEAUTIFUL MEAL,
BUT LARRY DIDN'T LIKE IT.

10:44.700 --> 10:47.333
A LITTLE SAUCY,
A LITTLE SAUCY.

10:47.367 --> 10:48.867
WE HAVE NO CHEF.

10:48.900 --> 10:50.667
( Jeff )
NO CHEF.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.133
HOW LONG ?

10:52.167 --> 10:57.300
WE OPEN IN TWO WEEKS AND I MEAN
WE BASICALLY STOPPED LOOKING

10:57.333 --> 10:59.033
AFTER WE GOT RANDY.

10:59.067 --> 11:01.300
SO, WE'RE BACK
TO SQUARE ONE.

11:03.067 --> 11:06.333
YOU GOT ARMS
ON YOUR CHAIR ?

11:06.367 --> 11:08.333
YOU'VE GOT ARMS
ON YOUR CHAIR.

11:08.367 --> 11:10.133
ONE SECOND.

11:10.167 --> 11:11.600
I GOT NO ARMS,
WHAT IS THAT ?

11:11.633 --> 11:12.633
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

11:12.667 --> 11:15.367
I'M JUST GETTING
A CHAIR WITH ARMS.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.467
LARRY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
YOU WANNA FOCUS ?

11:17.500 --> 11:20.067
WE'RE IN THIS MESS
'CAUSE YOU TOOK OUR CHEF

11:20.067 --> 11:21.633
FOR YOUR OWN LITTLE
PERSONAL PARTY.

11:21.667 --> 11:23.567
AT LEAST I WAS AT
THE POOL PARTY YESTERDAY.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.567
YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING
TO BE PART OF THIS THING.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.500
THE WHAT ?

11:26.533 --> 11:27.833
I HAD A POOL PARTY
YESTERDAY.

11:27.867 --> 11:30.900
POOL PARTY, JEFF AND I WERE
THE ONLY ONES WHO SHOWED UP.

11:30.933 --> 11:33.133
IT WAS A LITTLE
EMBARRASSING, YEAH.

11:33.167 --> 11:35.500
I THINK YOU ALL OWE,
YOU ALL OWE HIM AN APOLOGY.

11:35.533 --> 11:37.500
NO, I TOLD YOU
I COULDN'T MAKE IT.

11:37.533 --> 11:38.733
BUT I'M GLAD
YOU HAD A GOOD TIME.

11:38.767 --> 11:40.700
HUGH, I'M SORRY, I WROTE
THE WRONG DATE IN MY BOOK.

11:40.733 --> 11:43.767
I JUST WAS TIED UP
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.133
WE HAVE NO CHEF.

11:45.167 --> 11:46.567
IT WAS A GOOD PARTY,
WE HAD A GREAT TIME.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.967
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

11:49.067 --> 11:51.400
BUT ENOUGH ABOUT PARTIES,
WHAT ABOUT CHEFS ?

11:51.433 --> 11:53.100
WELL, WE ALL NEED
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

11:53.133 --> 11:54.067
FOR GETTING A CHEF.

11:54.067 --> 11:55.333
ABSOLUTELY,
WE HAVE TO MAKE

11:55.367 --> 11:58.067
A CONCERTED EFFORT
TOGETHER PLEASE.

11:58.067 --> 12:01.167
WHEN I NEED A NEW EDITOR
I GET HIM, BEG, BORROW OR STEAL,

12:01.200 --> 12:03.433
I GO OUT, I RAID, I GET,
WE NEED TO DO THAT WITH A CHEF.

12:03.467 --> 12:05.900
I WAS IN THIS RESTAURANT
THE OTHER DAY,
IT WAS A COFFEE SHOP.

12:05.933 --> 12:09.700
AND, UH, FOR SOME REASON
I HAD A SIDE DISH OF APPLESAUCE.

12:09.733 --> 12:12.967
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU
IT WAS REALLY FANTASTIC.

12:13.067 --> 12:14.433
IT WAS SO TASTY.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.567
AND I'M THINKING THEY NEVER
SERVE APPLESAUCE IN RESTAURANTS

12:17.600 --> 12:19.267
AND IT COULD
REALLY BE...

12:19.300 --> 12:21.933
I MEAN IF AND WHEN
THE TIME COMES FOR US

12:21.967 --> 12:23.467
TO BE THINKING ABOUT STUFF
LIKE THIS AS A SIDE DISH.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.333
ALRIGHT, WE'RE GONNA
WRITE THAT DOWN.

12:25.367 --> 12:26.700
VERY HELPFUL,
THANK YOU.

12:26.733 --> 12:28.067
AND WHEN YOU LOOK
FOR YOUR CHEF,

12:28.067 --> 12:29.567
MAKE SURE THEY KNOW
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT APPLESAUCE.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.800
YEAH, YOU BUY IT
AT A SUPERMARKET,
IT COMES IN A JAR.

12:31.833 --> 12:34.833
WE SHOULD CONSIDER IT,
YOU KNOW, FOR THE MENU,

12:34.867 --> 12:36.300
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE EVEN.

12:36.333 --> 12:38.200
( Jeff )
I THINK WE'RE GOOD,
I GOTTA GO TO A MEETING.

12:38.233 --> 12:39.367
SO, EVERYBODY'S GONNA
LOOK RIGHT ?

12:39.400 --> 12:41.200
YEAH, IF ANYONE FINDS
ANYTHING OUT PLEASE CALL.

12:41.233 --> 12:43.767
IT'S A VERY UNDERRATED
SIDE DISH, THAT'S MY POINT.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.700
IT'S AN UNDERRATED
SIDE DISH.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.067
DID YOU REALLY JUST SIGN
SARAH JESSICA PARKER

12:49.067 --> 12:50.733
TO A RECORDING CONTRACT ?

12:50.767 --> 12:52.600
YEAH, WHY NOT ?

12:57.067 --> 12:59.233
OH, IT'S ALL GONNA WORK OUT
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

12:59.267 --> 13:01.633
IT'S ONLY MONEY,
BIG DEAL.

13:01.667 --> 13:03.367
YEAH, MY MONEY, LARRY.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.700
SEE YOU LATER.

13:05.733 --> 13:06.400
B'BYE.

13:06.433 --> 13:07.633
ALRIGHT.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.233
AND THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR COMING.

13:09.267 --> 13:10.767
OH, PLEASE,
WE HAD A WONDERFUL TIME.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.733
I MEAN IT'S TOO BAD THESE
OTHER SCHLUBS COULDN'T, UH...

13:12.767 --> 13:13.900
THEY MISSED
A GOOD PARTY.

13:13.933 --> 13:15.100
YEAH, THEY SURE DID.

13:15.133 --> 13:16.600
THE WEATHER WORKED OUT,
IT WAS GREAT.

13:16.633 --> 13:18.167
YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE RUDE,

13:18.200 --> 13:19.633
IT WAS A LITTLE RUDE
ON THEIR PART I THOUGHT.

13:19.667 --> 13:20.900
I DON'T CARE.

13:20.933 --> 13:25.500
SO, AT THE POOL YESTERDAY,
I SAW YOUR SON AT THE POOL.

13:25.533 --> 13:28.733
THE KID'S GOT SOME PENIS ON HIM,
HE'S PRETTY GOOD.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.500
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ?

13:30.533 --> 13:32.800
YOUR SON, HIS PENIS.

13:32.833 --> 13:35.400
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING
THAT TO ME FOR ?

13:35.433 --> 13:39.167
HEY, IT'S A COMPLIMENT,
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ?

13:39.200 --> 13:40.467
WHAT'S THE COMPLIMENT,
I-I...

13:40.500 --> 13:42.167
WELL, HOW'S IT BAD,
HOW'S IT BAD ?

13:42.200 --> 13:44.100
HE'S GOT A NICE,
BIG PENIS, SO WHAT ?

13:44.133 --> 13:45.867
WELL, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
YOUR WIFE'S TITS, AM I ?

13:45.900 --> 13:47.067
I MEAN,
THIS IS RUDE...

13:47.100 --> 13:48.467
YOU COULD SAY MY WIFE
HAS NICE TITS

13:48.500 --> 13:51.667
AS LONG AS
IT'S COMPLIMENTARY.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.233
COME ON YOU.

13:53.267 --> 13:56.300
HUGH, NOT YOU,
HUGH, OKAY ?

13:58.567 --> 13:59.833
HUGH...

14:01.067 --> 14:02.733
HUGH.

14:05.833 --> 14:09.200
WELL, I'M SORRY THAT YOU'RE
HAVING SUCH A HARD TIME.

14:10.067 --> 14:11.867
HI.
HI.

14:12.567 --> 14:13.900
HI.

14:16.133 --> 14:17.233
HI.

14:17.267 --> 14:19.600
YOU REMEMBER MARTINE,

14:19.633 --> 14:21.833
THE MELLON'S NANNY.

14:21.867 --> 14:23.367
FROM THE POOL PARTY.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.867
YEAH, SHE'S HAVING
A BIT OF A PROBLEM.

14:25.900 --> 14:27.767
A PROBLEM I'LL SAY.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.700
MR. MELLON
FIRED ME.

14:30.733 --> 14:33.600
IT'S MY SUITCASE,
IT DOESN'T HAVE WHEELS.

14:33.633 --> 14:34.833
OH.

14:34.867 --> 14:38.067
SO, UM, SO SHE
CAME OVER HERE.

14:38.067 --> 14:40.733
IT SEEMS THAT
ONE OF THE GUESTS,

14:40.767 --> 14:44.067
FELT THE CABANA BATHROOM
WAS BENEATH HIM

14:44.067 --> 14:48.567
AND MADE HIS WAY
INTO THE MAIN HOUSE.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.633
HOW DID
HE FIND OUT ?

14:50.667 --> 14:53.367
MARGARITA THE COOK.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.500
SHE'S GOT
A PROBLEM WITH ME.

14:55.533 --> 14:59.600
SHE TOLD THAT I WAS THE PERSON
THAT LET THE GUEST IN.

14:59.633 --> 15:00.767
SHE SQUEALED
ON YOU ?

15:00.800 --> 15:02.067
SHE RATTED !

15:02.067 --> 15:03.067
AND HE FIRED YOU ?

15:03.067 --> 15:04.300
AND HE FIRED ME.

15:04.333 --> 15:06.833
WELL, OF COURSE I REMEMBER
WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

15:06.867 --> 15:09.700
THAT YOU WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED SO...

15:09.733 --> 15:12.967
DID YOU TELL HIM
THAT IT WAS ME ?

15:13.067 --> 15:15.800
NO, I DON'T DIME,
I DIDN'T DIME.

15:15.833 --> 15:18.967
SO, I REMEMBER
WHEN I LET YOU IN

15:19.067 --> 15:21.733
YOU SAID, IF THERE'S
ANY PROBLEM, I THINK,

15:21.767 --> 15:25.733
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT,
SO, HERE I AM.

15:25.767 --> 15:27.500
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO HOLD YOU TO THAT

15:27.533 --> 15:29.300
'CAUSE I DON'T
HAVE ANOTHER JOB.

15:31.167 --> 15:35.067
SO, I AM HOMELESS.

15:35.067 --> 15:36.133
EXCEPT I DON'T STINK.

15:36.167 --> 15:39.700
OKAY.

15:39.733 --> 15:41.833
YOUR HOME IS BIG.

15:41.867 --> 15:44.467
YOU KNOW WHAT MARTINE,
I BET,

15:44.500 --> 15:46.500
MR. DAVID CAN DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THE SITUATION.

15:46.533 --> 15:48.067
YEAH.
I HOPE SO.

15:48.067 --> 15:52.233
IS THERE ANY WAY THAT YOU COULD
MAYBE TALK TO MR. MELLON

15:52.267 --> 15:53.467
AND STRAIGHTEN
THINGS OUT ?

15:53.500 --> 15:56.433
BECAUSE I THINK IF YOU
SPOKE WITH HIM, I DON'T KNOW,

15:56.467 --> 15:59.067
HE WOULD TAKE ME BACK,
I'M A PRETTY GOOD NANNY.

15:59.067 --> 16:01.100
I'M A PRETTY
GOOD NANNY.

16:01.133 --> 16:03.400
I BROUGHT MY SUITCASE
SO, IF THERE'S ANY PROBLEM

16:03.433 --> 16:05.333
I CAN JUST STAY HERE.

16:05.367 --> 16:06.900
OH, THERE'S NOT
GONNA BE A PROBLEM.

16:06.933 --> 16:08.500
LARRY WILL
TAKE CARE OF IT.

16:08.533 --> 16:09.700
OH, I HOPE SO.

16:09.733 --> 16:15.067
WELL, THAT'S
A REALLY GOOD IDEA

16:15.067 --> 16:16.300
AND ORDINARILY I WOULD.

16:16.333 --> 16:19.867
BUT HUGH AND I HAVE HAD
KIND OF A FALLING OUT.

16:19.900 --> 16:21.400
WHAT HAPPENED ?

16:21.433 --> 16:27.433
WELL, I WAS IN
THE RESTAURANT EARLIER AND...

16:27.467 --> 16:30.400
WE GOT TO TALKING
ABOUT THE PARTY.

16:30.433 --> 16:31.633
AND I HAPPEN TO MENTION

16:31.667 --> 16:34.067
THAT I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE
OF HIS SON'S PENIS AND...

16:34.100 --> 16:36.800
HOW ABOUT
THAT THING ?

16:36.833 --> 16:38.933
IT'S HUGE.

16:38.967 --> 16:39.867
AND IT WAS PROBABLY
THE WRONG THING TO DO.

16:39.900 --> 16:42.233
YEAH, I THINK
IT PROBABLY WAS.

16:42.267 --> 16:44.300
BUT ANYWAY,
LIKE I WAS SAYING,

16:44.333 --> 16:46.233
IT'S GONNA BE
DIFFICULT TO...

16:48.433 --> 16:50.300
TALK TO HIM.

16:50.333 --> 16:51.967
WHY WOULD YOU
DO THAT, LARRY ?

16:52.067 --> 16:55.700
I TOOK A RISK.

16:55.733 --> 16:58.800
YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK YOU'RE
NOT GONNA HAVE A PROBLEM

16:58.833 --> 17:01.767
FINDING ANOTHER JOB.

17:01.800 --> 17:04.767
I MEAN, PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN
LOVE NANNIES...

17:04.800 --> 17:05.733
THEY NEED THEM.

17:05.767 --> 17:06.700
YEAH.

17:06.733 --> 17:08.367
BUT I'LL NEED MR. MELLON
AS A REFERENCE

17:08.400 --> 17:10.200
IF I'M GONNA
GET ANOTHER NANNY JOB.

17:10.233 --> 17:12.400
HE WAS MY ONLY REFERENCE,
THAT WAS MY FIRST NANNY JOB.

17:12.433 --> 17:13.400
OH.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.767
WHAT, WHAT, WHAT
DID YOU DO BEFORE THAT ?

17:15.800 --> 17:17.133
BEFORE THAT I WORKED
AT MAGIC MOUNTAIN

17:17.167 --> 17:19.867
IN THE LOONEY TUNES LODGE
FOR 15 YEARS.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.300
AH.

17:21.333 --> 17:23.067
IT'S WHERE ALL THE LOONEY TUNES
CHARACTERS WOULD COME OUT

17:23.100 --> 17:25.067
AND THEY WOULD
SIGN AUTOGRAPHS FOR KIDS.

17:25.067 --> 17:28.600
YOU KNOW,
JEFF AND I...

17:28.633 --> 17:30.133
WENT THERE ONCE
WITH HIS DAUGHTER.

17:30.167 --> 17:31.367
YOU DID ?

17:31.400 --> 17:32.867
HEY, I WENT IN THERE.

17:32.900 --> 17:35.100
AND THAT SONG,
THAT THEME IS PLAYED

17:35.133 --> 17:37.833
* DA, DA, DA, DA...

17:40.967 --> 17:41.667
THEY PLAY IT
ALL THE TIME.

17:41.700 --> 17:44.800
IT WAS FUN.

17:44.833 --> 17:47.300
CAN I TALK TO YOU IN
THE KITCHEN FOR JUST A SECOND ?

17:47.333 --> 17:48.900
SURE.

17:48.933 --> 17:51.900
I TOLD YOU NOT
TO USE THAT BATHROOM.

17:51.933 --> 17:53.367
WHY DID SHE COME
OVER HERE ?

17:53.400 --> 17:55.233
I DON'T KNOW.

17:55.267 --> 17:56.467
OBVIOUSLY SHE THINKS
I'M RESPONSIBLE

17:56.500 --> 17:58.567
FOR GETTING HER FIRED
AND HAS NO PLACE TO GO.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.867
SHE BROUGHT HER SUITCASE,
DID YOU SEE THAT ?

17:59.900 --> 18:01.133
I SAW IT, YEAH.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.600
DOES SHE THINK
SHE'S STAYING HERE ?

18:02.633 --> 18:04.533
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE THINKS IT,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE THINKS.

18:04.567 --> 18:06.833
WELL, I DO NOT WANT THE NANNY
FROM HELL IN MY HOUSE.

18:06.867 --> 18:08.500
WHERE DID
YOU HEAR THAT ?

18:08.533 --> 18:09.600
"THE BLANK FROM HELL."

18:09.633 --> 18:10.733
WHERE DID YOU HEAR
THAT EXPRESSION ?

18:10.767 --> 18:12.567
WELL, MY DAD USED
TO SAY IT ALL THE TIME.

18:12.600 --> 18:13.800
YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING
WAS FROM HELL.

18:13.833 --> 18:15.433
NOW SEE,
THAT'S RICHARD LEWIS'.

18:15.467 --> 18:17.533
IT'S NOT RICHARD LEWIS'.

18:17.567 --> 18:19.067
MY DAD HAS BEEN SAYING THAT,
YOU KNOW WHAT...

18:19.067 --> 18:20.200
RICHARD LEWIS
COINED THAT, CHERYL.

18:20.233 --> 18:24.300
LISTEN, THE POINT IS,
I DO NOT WANT HER HERE, OKAY ?

18:24.333 --> 18:25.867
YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE THE THINGS

18:25.900 --> 18:28.067
THAT SHE'S BEEN TELLING ME
FOR THE LAST 20 MINUTES.

18:28.067 --> 18:30.267
SHE'S FULL
OF NON-SEQUITURS.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.667
SHE TELLS ME SHE LIKES
TO PET HORSES.

18:32.700 --> 18:34.500
SHE ENJOYS
A GOOD CORN DOG.

18:34.533 --> 18:35.600
ENJOYS A GOOD
CORN DOG ?

18:35.633 --> 18:37.967
SHE TAKES BATHS
WITH HER SOCKS ON.

18:38.067 --> 18:40.400
I MEAN, HONESTLY SHE'S GOT
A SCREW LOOSE SOMEWHERE.

18:40.433 --> 18:42.300
I DON'T KNOW, SHE'S MAYBE
A LITTLE ECCENTRIC,

18:42.333 --> 18:44.533
BUT SHE SEEMS PERFECTLY
HARMLESS TO ME.

18:44.567 --> 18:52.067
( singing
Looney Tunes theme )

18:53.567 --> 18:55.467
WAIT A SECOND.

18:59.233 --> 19:00.700
JEFF NEEDS A NANNY.

19:00.733 --> 19:02.067
SUSIE'S PREGNANT.

19:02.067 --> 19:03.667
THEIR NANNY
JUST LEFT.

19:03.700 --> 19:04.767
SUSIE'S PREGNANT ?

19:04.800 --> 19:06.233
I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU,
SHE'S PREGNANT.

19:06.267 --> 19:08.133
THAT'S WHY
HE MOVED BACK.

19:08.167 --> 19:10.200
BUT THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR A NANNY.

19:10.233 --> 19:11.733
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
SUGGEST HER ?

19:11.767 --> 19:12.767
WELL, WHY NOT ?

19:12.800 --> 19:14.067
'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HER.

19:14.067 --> 19:15.400
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
SHE WAS A GOOD NANNY.

19:15.433 --> 19:16.733
SHE DIDN'T GET FIRED
FOR BEING A BAD NANNY.

19:16.767 --> 19:20.733
SHE GOT FIRED FOR LETTING ME
USE THE BATHROOM.

19:20.767 --> 19:23.133
IF THEY DON'T LIKE HER
THEY DON'T HAVE TO USE HER.

19:23.167 --> 19:25.067
RIGHT, THEY COULD
MEET HER AND...

19:25.067 --> 19:26.900
WE'RE DOING THEM
A FAVOR.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.867
THIS IS A WIN/WIN
SITUATION, WIN/WIN.

19:33.367 --> 19:36.700
* DA, DA, DA,
DA, DA... *

19:47.100 --> 19:49.667
YOU KNOW, WE GOTTA STOP OFF
AND GET SOME SPONGE CAKE.

19:49.700 --> 19:50.767
OKAY.

19:50.800 --> 19:51.733
IT'S MY FRIEND'S
BIRTHDAY.

19:51.767 --> 19:52.833
OH.

19:52.867 --> 19:53.900
YEAH, I'M BUYING HIM
SOME SPONGE CAKE.

19:53.933 --> 19:54.733
THERE YOU GO.

19:54.767 --> 19:55.567
YOU LIKE
SPONGE CAKE ?

19:55.600 --> 19:57.067
YEAH.
WHO DOESN'T ?

19:57.067 --> 19:58.900
HOW MANY SPONGE CAKES
DO YOU HAVE LEFT ?

19:58.933 --> 20:02.200
I HAVE, UM,
I HAVE A DOZEN LEFT.

20:02.233 --> 20:03.000
A DOZEN ?

20:03.033 --> 20:03.733
YEAH.

20:03.767 --> 20:06.833
OKAY, I'LL TAKE THEM ALL.

20:06.867 --> 20:08.167
OKAY, ALL OF THEM ?
YEAH.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.167
OH, I DON'T HAVE
ANYMORE BOXES THOUGH.

20:10.200 --> 20:14.367
OH, THAT'S OKAY, JUST PUT THEM
IN SARAN WRAP OR SOMETHING.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.167
I CAN DO THAT.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.667
OKAY, GREAT,
THANK YOU.

20:16.700 --> 20:17.967
YEAH.

20:20.967 --> 20:22.567
HEY !

20:25.300 --> 20:27.433
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING ?

20:27.467 --> 20:29.133
TAKE IT EASY
THEY'RE FREE.

20:46.967 --> 20:47.967
HERE, GET THE BELL.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
I GOT MY HANDS
FULL TOO.

20:49.033 --> 20:50.600
LOOK AT ME.

20:52.800 --> 20:57.533
( doorbell )

20:57.567 --> 21:01.067
( humming along
with doorbell )

21:06.233 --> 21:07.667
HELLO.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.600
THIS IS MARTINE, THE NANNY I WAS
TELLING YOU ABOUT ON THE PHONE.

21:10.633 --> 21:12.767
HI, MARTINE,
I'M SUSIE GREENE.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.400
LARRY, WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS,
WHAT ARE THESE ?

21:14.433 --> 21:15.867
OH, SPONGE CAKES.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.067
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
SPONGE CAKES ?

21:17.067 --> 21:19.067
IT'S A BIRTHDAY
PRESENT FOR JEFF.

21:19.067 --> 21:21.600
LARRY, HE'S NOT
FAT ENOUGH AS IT IS ?

21:21.633 --> 21:23.500
YOU WANT TO GIVE HIM
AND HE NEEDS THIS MANY ?

21:23.533 --> 21:24.667
WHAT IS,
THIS RIDICULOUS...

21:24.700 --> 21:26.433
WELL, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,
IT'S FROM BUTTERMAN'S.

21:26.467 --> 21:27.800
THEY'RE GOING
OUT OF BUSINESS.

21:27.833 --> 21:29.200
THE SPONGE CAKES
FROM THE POOL PARTY
THAT HE LOVED SO MUCH.

21:29.233 --> 21:31.667
I REMEMBER, YEAH, HE LOVED IT
SO MUCH TO HAVE A SLICE...

21:31.700 --> 21:33.367
NOT 25, HOW MANY
ARE THERE ?

21:33.400 --> 21:34.700
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

21:34.733 --> 21:36.467
WELL, THEY'LL LAST, THEY CAN
LAST FIVE YEARS, YOU KNOW ?

21:36.500 --> 21:38.233
WHAT AM I GONNA
DO FREEZE THEM ?

21:38.267 --> 21:40.367
THEY'RE NOT EVEN IN BOXES,
WHERE ARE THE BOXES ?

21:40.400 --> 21:43.133
OH, THEY'RE OUT OF BOXES,
THEY ONLY HAD SARAN WRAP.

21:43.167 --> 21:45.867
SO, THEY WRAPPED THEM UP
AND YOU BROUGHT THEM HERE,

21:45.900 --> 21:46.800
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

21:46.833 --> 21:47.967
THEY'RE GOING
OUT OF BUSINESS.

21:48.067 --> 21:49.967
LARRY, HE'S GONNA EXPLODE,
HE'S FAT !

21:50.067 --> 21:52.900
... ARE NEVER GOING
TO BE MADE AGAIN, THIS IS IT.

21:52.933 --> 21:54.600
I UNDERSTAND,
SHOULD I CARE ?

21:54.633 --> 21:55.967
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS.

21:56.067 --> 21:57.233
CONGRATULATIONS
ON WHAT, DEAR ?

21:57.267 --> 22:00.867
THE BABY,
CONGRATULATIONS.

22:00.900 --> 22:02.200
HOW DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT ?

22:02.233 --> 22:03.500
A BIG BIRD TOLD ME.

22:03.533 --> 22:04.567
LARRY, YOU KNEW
I WAS PREGNANT ?

22:04.600 --> 22:05.400
WHAT ?

22:05.433 --> 22:06.800
JEFF TOLD YOU
I WAS PREGNANT ?

22:06.833 --> 22:08.233
WELL, I DIDN'T...

22:08.267 --> 22:11.200
IT'S BAD LUCK IN THE FIRST
THREE MONTHS YOU DON'T TELL...

22:11.233 --> 22:12.800
THAT'S A SILLY
SUPERSTITION.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.833
LARRY, AND YOU
TOLD HER ?

22:14.867 --> 22:16.467
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HER,
WHO THE HELL IS SHE ?

22:16.500 --> 22:17.967
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,
DARLING...

22:18.067 --> 22:18.900
I DIDN'T TELL YOU...

22:18.933 --> 22:20.700
YES, YOU DID,
YES, YOU DID.

22:20.733 --> 22:23.367
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

22:23.400 --> 22:26.500
ALRIGHT, LOOK,
WHY DON'T YOU COME IN

22:26.533 --> 22:28.133
AND WE'LL HAVE
A LITTLE INTERVIEW ?

22:28.167 --> 22:30.067
HOW'S THAT, YOU LOOK
LIKE A LOVELY WOMAN.

22:30.067 --> 22:31.300
THIS MIGHT WORK OUT.

22:31.333 --> 22:32.533
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
WANT ME TO DO WITH THESE.

22:32.567 --> 22:33.967
I HAVE NO PLACE
TO PUT THEM.

22:34.067 --> 22:37.533
I DON'T HAVE A FREEZER THAT'S,
YOU KNOW, ADEQUATE FOR THIS.

22:37.567 --> 22:39.067
PUT THEM DOWN
IN THE KITCHEN, OKAY,

22:39.100 --> 22:40.300
JUST PUT THEM DOWN
IN THE KITCHEN.

22:40.333 --> 22:41.767
MARTINE DEAR,
COME IN.

22:41.800 --> 22:42.700
OKAY.

22:42.733 --> 22:44.167
OKAY ?

22:55.633 --> 22:56.900
HOW ARE YOU DOING ?

22:56.933 --> 22:58.467
I'M NAUSEATED.

22:58.500 --> 23:00.067
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT,
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

23:00.100 --> 23:01.500
YEAH, COME ON,
YOU ALREADY DID IT.

23:01.533 --> 23:03.133
IT'S NOT A LIVE
PERFORMANCE.

23:03.167 --> 23:05.567
IT'S JUST, IT'S ALREADY,
YOU ALREADY FILMED IT.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.533
IT'S GOOD,
I'VE SEEN IT.

23:07.567 --> 23:08.933
HBO LIKES IT, RIGHT ?

23:08.967 --> 23:10.700
YEAH, THEY DO,
THEY DO LIKE IT.

23:10.733 --> 23:12.733
OKAY, SO THERE YOU GO.

23:12.767 --> 23:13.933
ARE THEY HERE NOW ?

23:13.967 --> 23:15.300
NO, THEY DON'T COME.

23:15.333 --> 23:18.267
NO, THEY DON'T, THEY SEE IT IN
THEIR PRIVATE HOMES OR WHATEVER.

23:18.300 --> 23:19.667
THE PRIVACY
OF THEIR HOMES ?

23:19.700 --> 23:21.933
OH, IS THAT THE PROPER WAY
OF SAYING THAT SENTENCE ?

23:21.967 --> 23:24.967
WHY, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LIKE
AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE COP.

23:25.067 --> 23:26.300
IT'S LIKE
UNBELIEVABLE.

23:26.333 --> 23:27.667
HEY, BY THE WAY,
I WAS THINKING,

23:27.700 --> 23:30.600
MAYBE YOU CAN INTRODUCE ME
TO THAT BARTLETT'S GUY.

23:30.633 --> 23:32.467
MAYBE I COULD SCHMOOZE
A LITTLE BIT, YOU KNOW,

23:32.500 --> 23:34.900
BEFORE THE SPECIAL.

23:34.933 --> 23:36.733
YEAH, WELL, THERE'S
A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH THAT.

23:36.767 --> 23:37.900
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

23:37.933 --> 23:39.867
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE
GONNA GET THAT QUOTE IN.

23:39.900 --> 23:41.433
I'M NOT SURE ANYMORE.

23:41.467 --> 23:42.767
WHY ?

23:42.800 --> 23:44.200
HE TALKED TO HIM
ABOUT THE PENIS.

23:44.233 --> 23:45.867
I JUST BROACHED
THE SUBJECT.

23:45.900 --> 23:47.067
WHY WOULD
YOU DO THAT ?

23:47.067 --> 23:49.267
( cell phone ringing )
I WAS JUST CURIOUS.

23:49.300 --> 23:50.767
YEAH, BUT NOW
I'M NOT GONNA GET IN.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.233
NOT THE BARTLETT, YEAH.

23:53.267 --> 23:54.400
YOU'RE KIDDING,
IS SHE OKAY ?

23:54.433 --> 23:57.567
YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE
BROUGHT IT UP, LARRY, FUCK.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.100
ALRIGHT,
I'LL BE RIGHT HOME.

23:59.133 --> 24:01.067
YOUR NANNY
ATTACKED SUSIE.

24:01.067 --> 24:02.800
WHAT ?

24:02.833 --> 24:04.467
IS SHE OKAY ?

24:06.400 --> 24:08.667
HEY, DO YOU
WANT ME TO...

24:08.700 --> 24:12.067
THIS WHOLE NIGHT IS
TURNING OUT TO, OH, CHRIST.

24:12.067 --> 24:13.133
DON'T WORRY,
WE'LL CALL.

24:13.167 --> 24:14.300
SHOULD I GO ?

24:14.333 --> 24:15.467
I CAN'T EVEN
WATCH THIS NOW.

24:15.500 --> 24:16.867
GO ?

24:16.900 --> 24:18.767
IF YOU LEAVE ME NOW
I COLLAPSE.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.633
YOU COLLAPSE ?

24:20.667 --> 24:22.567
YEAH, I'LL COLLAPSE.

24:22.600 --> 24:24.333
WHAT'S WRONG WITH,
YEAH, I MEAN I, I,

24:24.367 --> 24:25.433
YOU GOTTA,
I NEED YOU HERE.

24:25.467 --> 24:26.600
YOU SAY IT
THE SAME WAY I DO.

24:26.633 --> 24:27.633
COLLAPSE I SAY.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.700
NO, C-L-A-P-S-E.

24:29.733 --> 24:32.700
YOU DON'T SAY COLLAPSE,
YOU SAY "CLAPSE".

24:35.067 --> 24:35.800
WHO'S THAT ?

24:35.833 --> 24:36.900
THAT'S THE KID.

24:36.933 --> 24:37.867
THAT'S THE PORN BABY ?

24:37.900 --> 24:39.467
THAT'S THE PORN BABY.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.667
WHY IS THE PORN
BABY HERE ?

24:41.700 --> 24:43.333
WELL, BECAUSE
HE FIRED HIS NANNY.

24:43.367 --> 24:44.467
HE DOESN'T HAVE A NANNY,

24:44.500 --> 24:46.133
HE HAS TO TAKE CARE OF
THE KID NOW, I GUESS.

24:46.167 --> 24:47.867
I DON'T WANT A LITTLE KID
WATCHING MY SPECIALS.

24:47.900 --> 24:50.100
BUT HIS FATHER'S HERE TOO,
SO I GUESS HE CAME.

24:50.133 --> 24:51.200
HE DECIDED TO COME.

24:51.233 --> 24:52.400
I DON'T WANT A BABY
IN THE SCREENING.

24:52.433 --> 24:55.067
BUT THAT'S A GOOD SIGN
FOR THE QUOTE.

24:55.100 --> 24:56.633
HE'S HERE, HE CAME.

24:58.133 --> 25:01.133
Oh, Christ,
that really was great,

25:01.167 --> 25:03.833
but it's too much
and it threw me.

25:03.867 --> 25:06.700
SHH, SHH, SHH.

25:06.733 --> 25:10.067
I took some time off
and I was a little burned out.

25:10.100 --> 25:11.300
I HATE THIS SHOW.

25:11.333 --> 25:12.900
IT'S A GROWN-UP SHOW.

25:12.933 --> 25:16.100
I HAVE TO SIT
THROUGH YOUR CARTOONS,
YOU WATCH THIS ONE.

25:17.567 --> 25:19.100
I WANT POPCORN.

25:19.133 --> 25:21.067
NO, POPCORN, IT'S NOT
THAT KIND OF THEATER.

25:21.067 --> 25:22.100
I WANT A SODA.

25:22.133 --> 25:24.567
HEY, SHH.

25:26.067 --> 25:28.733
SHH, YOURSELF.

25:28.767 --> 25:30.633
YOU SHUSH, SHUSH !

25:30.667 --> 25:31.867
YOU SHH
POOPY HEAD.

25:31.900 --> 25:33.433
NO, YOU SHH
DO-DO BRAIN.

25:33.467 --> 25:34.167
YOU'RE A DO-DO BRAIN.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.667
YOU'RE
A DO-DO BRAIN.

25:35.700 --> 25:39.167
No, these are all new
and improved dysfunctions.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.733
I WANT TO GO HOME.

25:40.767 --> 25:42.433
AS SOON AS ITS OVER
WE'LL GO HOME, NOW BE QUIET.

25:42.467 --> 25:43.733
SHH, QUIET.

25:43.767 --> 25:45.067
YOU BIG QUIET
BIG NOSE.

25:45.067 --> 25:46.533
OH, LOOK WHO'S TALKING.

25:46.567 --> 25:49.067
HEY, DON'T TALK
TO MY KID, OKAY ?

25:49.067 --> 25:50.433
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU GET
UNCLE MILTIE OUT OF HERE

25:50.467 --> 25:51.867
SO, WE CAN WATCH
THIS THING ?

25:51.900 --> 25:52.633
YOU'RE STUPID.

25:52.667 --> 25:53.800
YOU'RE STUPID.

25:53.833 --> 25:54.767
YOU'RE MORE STUPID.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.533
YOU'RE MUCH,
MUCH STUPIDER.

25:56.567 --> 25:57.733
NO, I'M NOT, YOU ARE.

25:57.767 --> 26:00.333
NO, YOU ARE.

26:00.367 --> 26:01.767
DON'T SPEAK
TO US AGAIN, ALRIGHT ?

26:01.800 --> 26:02.867
I'M WARNING YOU,
I'M WARNING YOU.

26:02.900 --> 26:03.967
HE WOULDN'T BE HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE

26:04.067 --> 26:05.500
IF YOU DIDN'T
FIRE THAT NANNY.

26:05.533 --> 26:08.533
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO FIRE HER IF
SOME ASSHOLE DIDN'T BRIBE HER.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.467
FUCK HUGH.

26:11.500 --> 26:13.100
FUCK YOU.

26:13.133 --> 26:15.467
FUCK HUGH !

26:15.500 --> 26:18.467
HUGH, HUGH !

26:23.233 --> 26:24.067
EVERYTHING OKAY ?

26:24.100 --> 26:25.567
I CALLED THREE TIMES
LAST NIGHT.

26:25.600 --> 26:27.467
YEAH, WELL, I HAVEN'T
CHECKED THE MESSAGES.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.233
I'VE BEEN LIKE
UNBELIEVABLY BUSY.

26:29.267 --> 26:30.900
HOW IS SHE DOING,
IS SHE OKAY ?

26:30.933 --> 26:32.667
GO UP AND ASK HER.

26:32.700 --> 26:33.900
IS THE BABY...

26:33.933 --> 26:35.300
SHE'S UPSTAIRS,
GO UP AND ASK HER.

26:35.333 --> 26:36.700
SUPERSTITION,
SHE WAS RIGHT.

26:36.733 --> 26:37.867
YOU NEVER SHOULD
HAVE TOLD ME.

26:44.100 --> 26:46.067
LARRY, COME IN.

26:46.067 --> 26:49.833
OH, MY GOD, I'M SO SORRY ABOUT
THE NANNY AND EVERYTHING.

26:49.867 --> 26:52.067
LARRY THAT NANNY
SHE WAS A SICKO.

26:52.067 --> 26:53.867
SHE WAS A MENTAL CASE,
SHE WAS SICK.

26:53.900 --> 26:56.100
WHAT, THE NANNY ?

26:56.133 --> 26:57.333
OH, MY GOD.

26:57.367 --> 26:58.667
SHE WAS MENTALLY ILL.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.367
OBVIOUSLY I DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT

27:00.400 --> 27:01.967
OTHERWISE I NEVER
WOULD HAVE RECOMMENDED HER.

27:02.067 --> 27:04.200
NO, OF COURSE, WHY WOULD
YOU SEND ME A SICKO ?

27:04.233 --> 27:05.167
WHY WOULD
I DO THAT ?

27:05.200 --> 27:06.600
THAT WOULD
MAKE ME DERANGED.

27:06.633 --> 27:09.433
YEAH, WELL, SHE NEEDS
TO BE PUT AWAY THIS WOMAN.

27:09.467 --> 27:10.833
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED ?

27:10.867 --> 27:13.533
I LEFT SAMMY ALONE
IN HER ROOM WATCHING TV.

27:13.567 --> 27:16.067
( Looney Tunes theme )

27:24.133 --> 27:26.300
( Susie )
ALL OF A SUDDEN
SHE STARTS SCREAMING.

27:26.333 --> 27:28.867
MOMMY, MOMMY !

27:28.900 --> 27:30.133
I RAN IN.

27:30.167 --> 27:34.500
THE NANNY IS LIKE WATCHING
SOME LOONEY TUNES CARTOON

27:34.533 --> 27:35.900
AND WENT CRAZY.

27:35.933 --> 27:37.167
OH, YEAH,
YOU KNOW WHY ?

27:37.200 --> 27:40.333
'CAUSE SHE WORKED AT THAT
LOONY TUNES LODGE FOR 15 YEARS

27:40.367 --> 27:42.700
AND SHE KEPT HEARING THAT
SONG OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

27:42.733 --> 27:44.233
* DA, DA,
DA, DA... *

27:44.267 --> 27:45.700
YEAH, YEAH.

27:45.733 --> 27:48.100
YEAH, SHE MUST HAVE SNAPPED FROM
HEARING IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

27:48.133 --> 27:51.067
LARRY, SHE WENT CRAZY,
I'M TELLING YOU.

27:51.067 --> 27:52.533
I MEAN, SHE STARTED
GOING WACKY.

27:52.567 --> 27:53.700
WHAT DID SHE DO ?

27:53.733 --> 27:54.833
SHE STARTS
FIGHTING WITH ME.

27:54.867 --> 27:57.567
SHE GRABBED MY ARM.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.700
SHE STARTS PULLING ME
BACK AND FORTH.

27:59.733 --> 28:02.267
ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M FIGHTING
WITH THIS CRAZY WOMAN.

28:02.300 --> 28:04.067
I MEAN
PHYSICALLY FIGHTING.

28:04.067 --> 28:06.733
NEXT THING I KNEW WE WERE
LIKE OUT ON THE DECK.

28:06.767 --> 28:07.800
OUT ON THE DECK ?

28:07.833 --> 28:10.667
YEAH, LIKE STRUGGLING
AND FIGHTING.

28:10.700 --> 28:12.600
OH, MY GOD,
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED ?

28:12.633 --> 28:15.800
SHE PUSHED ME
OVER THE RAIL.

28:15.833 --> 28:18.400
THIS CRAZY WOMAN,
SHE PUSHED ME OVER THE RAIL.

28:18.433 --> 28:20.400
SHE WAS TRYING
TO KILL ME !

28:21.733 --> 28:23.767
WHAT, HOW...

28:23.800 --> 28:25.833
HERE'S THE THING, LAR.

28:25.867 --> 28:28.400
