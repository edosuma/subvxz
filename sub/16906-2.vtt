WEBVTT

00:03.169 --> 00:06.378
Very well. I certainly appreciate
your candor.

00:10.443 --> 00:12.354
Were you just Skyping with a horse?

00:12.445 --> 00:13.185
Not a horse, Lemon.

00:13.279 --> 00:17.159
Rafalca, Mitt Romney's
champion dressage mare.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.321
- Sure.
- She answers yes or no questions

00:19.419 --> 00:22.593
by eating either an apple for "yes"
or a carrot for "no."

00:22.689 --> 00:27.502
And if she eats both, that means
life is full of unknowable gray areas.

00:27.594 --> 00:28.436
Remarkable animal.

00:28.528 --> 00:29.734
And thanks to Rafalca,

00:30.030 --> 00:33.443
lam now fully briefed on the Romney
campaign's latest setback.

00:33.533 --> 00:34.671
Did you see the news this morning?

00:34.768 --> 00:35.803
I saw "The Today Show".

00:36.102 --> 00:39.345
Sol know how to make an autumn
pizza that your teen will love.

00:39.439 --> 00:42.249
Paul Ryan dropped out
of the race last night.

00:42.475 --> 00:43.749
What?

00:44.044 --> 00:45.045
Wow. Why?

00:45.145 --> 00:47.625
It turns out he was actually
born in Kenya.

00:49.115 --> 00:50.492
Not a lot we could say about that one.

00:50.583 --> 00:52.119
So now who's Romney's
running mate gonna be?

00:52.218 --> 00:54.255
Rafalca assured me that an announcement

00:54.354 --> 00:55.628
would be made later today.

00:55.722 --> 00:59.260
Or she just wanted to eat an apple.

00:59.359 --> 01:01.839
And how's tanking NBC going?
Is Hank ready to sell?

01:02.128 --> 01:03.664
Soon he'll have no choice.

01:03.763 --> 01:06.266
"Sunday Night Football" is just
Cleveland Browns games.

01:06.366 --> 01:09.142
I'm allowing Jimmy Fallon
to use his real voice.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.841
And the greatest band
in late night, The Roots!

01:13.373 --> 01:14.545
And you're certainly doing your part.

01:14.641 --> 01:17.121
Last week's show was excruciating.

01:17.210 --> 01:19.588
Thank you. I told the writers
there are no bad ideas,

01:19.679 --> 01:21.352
and they really took that to heart.

01:21.448 --> 01:24.395
Yes, I have a reservation
under "Black Hitler".

01:24.484 --> 01:26.122
You know, I could get used
to this "not caring" thing.

01:26.219 --> 01:28.529
And what about your reproductive efforts?

01:28.621 --> 01:29.565
Bluh.

01:29.656 --> 01:31.795
Criss and I have been taking
the dump truck

01:32.092 --> 01:33.594
to the boneyard most nights.

01:33.693 --> 01:35.764
Oh, come on.
Try to enjoy it, Lemon.

01:35.862 --> 01:38.240
Criss looks like a little elf prince!

01:38.765 --> 01:41.371
I should get back downstairs.
The show's not gonna phone itself in.

01:41.468 --> 01:42.640
I do have one concern, Lemon.

01:42.735 --> 01:45.238
Elections can be very good
for sketch comedy shows.

01:45.338 --> 01:46.817
And the last thing I need

01:47.107 --> 01:49.678
is an election-year
ratings spike for TGS.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.551
So no political stuff.

01:51.644 --> 01:54.682
Oh, okay, sure. We'll just have
to rely on observational humor.

01:54.781 --> 01:58.194
Like, um, "table" is a weird word.

01:58.284 --> 01:59.490
Thank you, Lemon.

01:59.586 --> 02:01.827
And you gotta wonder
who came up with the door.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.430
A bunch of cavemen sitting around,

02:03.523 --> 02:06.834
"Hey, Gronk! Before we starve
to death in here, let's make a door!"

02:07.127 --> 02:08.366
I, uh --

02:10.000 --> 02:16.074

02:21.500 --> 02:26.000
7x02 - Governor Dunston
Original Air Date on October 11, 2012

02:27.413 --> 02:29.256
I have been waiting seven years

02:29.349 --> 02:31.329
to tell you people
what I really think of you.

02:31.417 --> 02:33.795
Really? 'Cause you called me
"Mr. Clean's gay uncle"

02:33.887 --> 02:35.264
in front of my children.

02:35.355 --> 02:40.202
This is my first royalty check
from my summer dance jam, "Balls".

02:40.293 --> 02:41.772
<i># Balls! Balls, balls, balls,
balls, balls, balls #</i>

02:41.861 --> 02:43.431
<i># Balls! Balls, balls, balls,
balls, balls, balls #</i>

02:43.530 --> 02:45.532
<i># Balls! Balls! Balls! Balls! #</i>

02:45.632 --> 02:47.441
<i># Balls! Balls! Balls! Balls! #</i>

02:47.600 --> 02:51.343
In this envelope
is my cut of every CD sale,

02:51.437 --> 02:55.886
paid download, music video
DVD rental at Blockbuster --

02:56.176 --> 02:57.883
Oh, boy. Jenna, you might want
to look at the check

02:58.178 --> 02:59.248
before you insult us.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.551
And maybe you want to look in a mirror

03:00.647 --> 03:02.251
before leaving your house in the morning

03:02.348 --> 03:04.919
because you look like someone's
been slowly poisoning Sally Field.

03:05.218 --> 03:06.458
Alrighty then.

03:06.553 --> 03:10.865
Read it and weep,
you mouth-breathing vag-repellers!

03:10.957 --> 03:12.402
It's $90, Jenna.

03:12.492 --> 03:14.472
What?! How?!

03:14.561 --> 03:16.472
That song was everywhere!

03:16.563 --> 03:19.567
The FBI blamed it for a spike
in summer sex crimes!

03:19.666 --> 03:21.543
Well, the music industry
isn't what it used to be.

03:21.634 --> 03:25.548
Thanks to Al Gore's stupid Internet,
people can just get music for free.

03:25.638 --> 03:27.675
That's why I got out
of the music business.

03:27.774 --> 03:33.486
<i># Despite my beautiful singing voice #</i>

03:33.580 --> 03:38.757
<i># And my amazing songwriting #</i>

03:40.420 --> 03:41.922
- Hey, Jenna.
- Shut up.

03:42.222 --> 03:42.962
Hey, what are you doing here?

03:43.256 --> 03:44.701
Oh, just thought I'd pop in.

03:44.791 --> 03:46.668
No, you damn well didn't!

03:47.260 --> 03:49.297
Lunchtime is when you "pop in".

03:49.395 --> 03:52.239
You got something else on your mind, son.

03:52.332 --> 03:53.333
Fresh shave.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.572
Elevated pulse.

03:55.668 --> 03:57.306
Cologne.

03:57.437 --> 03:58.939
This man is here to do it on a desk.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.513
Tracy, you're disgusting.

04:00.607 --> 04:02.587
No, Liz, he's right.
I am.

04:03.009 --> 04:04.010
No, but I'm not being gross!

04:04.310 --> 04:06.756
We're trying to have a baby,
and you know how Liz's libido is.

04:06.846 --> 04:08.484
So I'm trying to keep it
from being a chore!

04:08.581 --> 04:10.322
That's why I started
tracking her menstrual cycle --

04:10.416 --> 04:11.554
You don't have to prove anything to them.

04:11.651 --> 04:12.527
Just shut your mouth, Criss!

04:13.786 --> 04:16.562
I'm sorry, you're tracking my cycle?

04:16.656 --> 04:19.000
I don't want you stressing about it,
so I made this calendar.

04:19.291 --> 04:20.793
I thought you'd like to know
that you're ovulating.

04:20.892 --> 04:23.373
And I came here today to...

04:23.463 --> 04:26.034
I don't know, spice things up.
I know, it was stupid.

04:26.332 --> 04:29.438
- I know.
- No, okay, I get it. It's --

04:29.535 --> 04:30.639
In the office.

04:30.737 --> 04:33.377
It's like I'm Don Draper
and you're Megan --

04:33.473 --> 04:34.645
Okay, you're Don Draper.

04:34.741 --> 04:36.345
No, you're Glen and I'm Sally!

04:38.845 --> 04:42.520
Wait, there's a system!
This is all organized! God!

04:42.615 --> 04:46.757
The Post-its are for my ideas,
and the pens are for my teeth.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.965
Liz, you have to see this!

04:49.055 --> 04:50.500
Hornberger, what if we'd been having sex?

04:50.590 --> 04:52.797
Then I would have seen
Criss's muscular back.

04:52.892 --> 04:54.462
You think I care?

04:54.560 --> 04:56.437
<i>The next Vice President
of the United States,</i>

04:56.529 --> 04:58.440
<i>Governor Bob Dunston of Alabama!</i>

04:58.531 --> 05:01.671
<i>Well okey-dokey-doo, America!</i>

05:02.302 --> 05:03.838
We gotta have Tracy play this guy
on the show.

05:03.936 --> 05:05.415
He looks exactly like him!

05:05.505 --> 05:08.782
And I was thinking we'd just
lay off the political stuff --

05:08.875 --> 05:11.685
Oh, Liz, he's right.
That guy really looks like Tracy.

05:11.778 --> 05:14.452
Did you guys see
I'm on TV but now I'm old?!

05:14.547 --> 05:17.528
Oh, God, Miss Lemon,
it's happening to you, too!

05:17.817 --> 05:20.423
Okay, fine, the guy looks like Tracy.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.464
But what's the joke?

05:21.554 --> 05:23.795
<i>Ooh, I'm gonna have to
take a moment here.</i>

05:23.890 --> 05:25.961
<i>I sat on my testicles earlier</i>

05:26.059 --> 05:27.436
<i>and the heft of my body</i>

05:27.527 --> 05:29.404
<i>smashed them to smithereens!</i>

05:29.495 --> 05:30.735
Okay, start working on the wig.

05:30.830 --> 05:31.774
<i>Aah!</i>

05:35.902 --> 05:38.473
Oh, Ms. Maroney,
I want you to meet my mother --

05:38.571 --> 05:40.050
I'm going to stop you
right there, Kenneth.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.081
I am having
an actress side-project crisis,

05:42.375 --> 05:43.979
so I am not interested
in whatever this is

05:44.077 --> 05:45.886
and whatever it thinks it's wearing.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.052
Oh, I can't believe
I just met Jenna Maroney!

05:51.351 --> 05:53.695
I'm so nervous.
I hope I didn't embarrass you.

05:53.786 --> 05:56.062
You were fine, but your friend Ron

05:56.356 --> 05:58.996
sure doesn't know
how to behave around celebrities.

05:59.092 --> 06:02.073
Oh! Oh, I am so sorry, Kenny.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.864
You know, the only celebrity I ever met

06:03.963 --> 06:06.000
was Evel Knievel's motorcycle.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.669
And that was just a picture.

06:07.767 --> 06:08.768
Oh, I almost forgot.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.041
We got you a little something
for your birthday.

06:11.137 --> 06:13.378
Is that a CD?!

06:15.575 --> 06:18.886
You people still buy CDs?!

06:18.978 --> 06:23.484
Kenneth's mother! OMG!
Why haven't you visited us before?!

06:23.583 --> 06:25.426
Well, money's been tight

06:25.518 --> 06:28.556
ever since the market crashed
into our house.

06:28.654 --> 06:31.635
My name is Ron.
I'm Pearline's friend.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.533
I've met celebrities before.

06:33.626 --> 06:36.072
Do you know Evel Knievel's
motorcycle picture?

06:36.162 --> 06:39.575
Oh! Come on, Ron, I'm better than that.

06:39.665 --> 06:42.509
I have so many questions
to ask you people!

06:42.602 --> 06:44.013
Tomorrow, when we break for lunch,

06:44.103 --> 06:48.449
you are coming to my dressing room
and watching me eat.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.789
I wonder what she eats.

06:56.883 --> 07:00.126
<i>Now, I've been
very upfront about this.</i>

07:00.420 --> 07:01.990
<i>See, that girl was in my car</i>

07:02.088 --> 07:05.558
<i>because I was trying to talk her
out of being a prostitute.</i>

07:05.658 --> 07:06.500
<i>And she</i> --

07:06.592 --> 07:09.163
Jack, I have to let Tracy
play Governor Dunston.

07:09.462 --> 07:10.532
Absolutely not.

07:10.663 --> 07:12.609
Come on, he looks exactly like him!

07:12.698 --> 07:14.905
Give me a break, Jack.
Listen to this guy!

07:15.001 --> 07:17.504
<i>Hang on, I'm caught on a nail here --</i>

07:17.603 --> 07:18.081
<i>Aah!</i>

07:20.139 --> 07:22.210
<i>Okay, now we can continue.</i>

07:22.508 --> 07:24.488
I can't just ignore Dunston, Jack.

07:24.577 --> 07:26.750
Everyone's talking about
how much he looks like Tracy.

07:26.846 --> 07:29.884
NBC.com had over a hundred hits today!

07:29.982 --> 07:32.792
Exactly. I'm trying to tank this network.

07:32.885 --> 07:35.923
To that end, I have asked you
to lay off politics.

07:36.022 --> 07:40.061
Uh-huh, but you really meant
was lay off Republicans, didn't you?

07:40.159 --> 07:41.729
This is not about politics, Lemon.

07:41.828 --> 07:44.809
In order to save this network,
I have to destroy it.

07:44.897 --> 07:45.967
Just like BP did

07:46.065 --> 07:48.705
when they heroically tried
to lubricate the Gulf of Mexico.

07:48.801 --> 07:53.181
Now, do not write anything
about Bob Dunston.

07:54.574 --> 07:57.783
I promise I won't write a word.

08:00.079 --> 08:03.060
<i>Are we better off now than
we were four years ago? Not me.</i>

08:03.149 --> 08:04.958
<i>I now have herpes</i>

08:05.051 --> 08:07.554
<i>and the Dixie Mafia
is trying to kill me.</i>

08:20.566 --> 08:22.512
Hey, elf prince!

08:22.602 --> 08:25.014
What makes you think
my last period started on the 29th?

08:25.104 --> 08:26.845
Because you kept saying
your Aunt Flo was in town --

08:26.939 --> 08:31.183
She was! Remember?
I took her to MoMA and the Cloisters?

08:31.277 --> 08:33.222
I assumed those were
all vaginal euphemisms!

08:33.513 --> 08:36.926
Great. So we had sex for no reason.
No reason at all!

08:37.015 --> 08:38.756
- Wow. Thank you.
- Well...

08:38.851 --> 08:43.596
Look, Liz, I know this isn't your... jam.

08:43.688 --> 08:45.168
Which is why I've been
trying to make it fun.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.761
I surprised you at the office,
I wrote you that song --

08:48.528 --> 08:52.271
<i># Your body is my Garden of Eden #</i>

08:52.565 --> 08:54.067
I hate you!

08:54.166 --> 08:56.077
I'm sorry.

08:56.168 --> 08:57.078
I hate you!

08:57.169 --> 08:58.580
Liz, we both want this to happen,

08:58.671 --> 09:00.116
but it's not gonna work if it's a chore.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.949
Yeah, okay. I know.
I have to relax.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.080
And I promise, as soon as I figure out

09:06.178 --> 09:07.851
when I really am ovulating...

09:11.317 --> 09:12.728
You just spoke in German.

09:13.319 --> 09:14.662
I don't think so, Criss.

09:18.257 --> 09:22.637
<i>I'm caught on a nail here.
I'm caught on a nail.</i>

09:24.697 --> 09:27.143
<i>That was Tracy Jordan
having some fun the other night</i>

09:27.233 --> 09:29.144
<i>at the expense
of Governor Bob Dunston.</i>

09:29.235 --> 09:31.647
<i>Liz, The New York Times called.</i>

09:31.737 --> 09:33.239
George Clooney wants to be on the show.

09:33.339 --> 09:34.909
And you got a gift basket --

09:35.007 --> 09:37.647
Gift basket?!

09:37.743 --> 09:38.949
Pears?! Why?!

09:39.045 --> 09:41.047
Lemon, a word.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.296
We had an agreement.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.192
You promised not to write anything
about Dunston.

09:49.288 --> 09:52.326
And I didn't. Every one
of Tracy's lines last night

09:52.625 --> 09:55.196
was a direct quote
from Governor Dunston himself.

09:55.294 --> 09:58.138
I see. Well, bravo.

09:58.230 --> 10:00.107
You're supposed to say
"brava" to a woman.

10:00.199 --> 10:01.678
Oh, I am well aware of that.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.303
This is a disaster.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.139
Ratings are up,
and now, during the election,

10:05.237 --> 10:09.208
Hank Hooper wants TGS on
five nights a week starting tonight.

10:09.308 --> 10:11.185
You are un-terriblizing this network!

10:11.277 --> 10:12.950
Wait, I have to do a show every night?

10:13.045 --> 10:15.025
Uh-huh. Say good-bye to your free time.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.024
Did you hear that?

10:16.115 --> 10:19.153
That's the sound of "Honey Boo Boo"s
piling up on your TiVo.

10:19.251 --> 10:21.731
- No!
- Your show is ruining my career

10:21.821 --> 10:23.801
and besmirching the name
of a good American.

10:23.889 --> 10:26.267
Bob Dunston is a fine man.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.168
A-ha, so this is about politics!

10:28.260 --> 10:31.332
I'm sure you'd let us make fun
of Joe Biden all we want.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.905
Oh, but how could you?
He's so amazing.

10:32.999 --> 10:34.808
He rides the train!

10:34.900 --> 10:38.074
Liz, Dunston's at a county fair,
and he ate too much chili!

10:43.676 --> 10:45.917
I'm sorry, Jack.
This is bigger than both of us.

10:47.179 --> 10:51.855
<i>Oh, boy, when did ol' Bob Dunston</i>
<i>swallow all this change?!</i>

10:55.655 --> 10:58.158
Pearline, you must be
so proud of Kenneth.

10:58.924 --> 11:01.837
Smell him.
That's Jenna Maroney's garbage!

11:01.927 --> 11:04.203
Oh, he's always been such a special boy.

11:04.296 --> 11:05.707
I remember the day he was born.

11:05.798 --> 11:09.245
He looked up at me and said,
"Momma, I am not a person.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.248
My body's just a flesh vessel
for an immortal being

11:12.338 --> 11:15.410
whose name, if you heard it,
would make you lose your mind."

11:16.042 --> 11:17.282
Do you remember that, honey?

11:17.376 --> 11:19.788
Oh, we're just all so proud of Kenny.

11:19.879 --> 11:23.019
I tell everyone I meet I know
a big shot up in New York City!

11:24.450 --> 11:26.191
Great story, Ron.

11:26.285 --> 11:29.892
So, tell me. What kind of music
do you folks like to buy?

11:29.989 --> 11:33.869
Well, Jenna, you know, times are tough.

11:33.959 --> 11:35.131
And it's not getting any easier

11:35.227 --> 11:38.401
now that Obamacare's extending
our life expectancy.

11:38.698 --> 11:39.904
Let me die in an emergency room

11:39.999 --> 11:42.240
with a treatable disease
like an American!

11:42.334 --> 11:44.746
But music can let you forget
about all that.

11:44.837 --> 11:46.976
Folks like us, we need an escape.

11:47.073 --> 11:51.783
It's like what Jimmy Buffett says,
"I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise."

11:51.877 --> 11:53.857
Of course, we don't have a stereo anymore

11:53.946 --> 11:55.789
on account of our mayor
who's a meth addict.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.155
Took it apart in a field.

11:57.917 --> 11:59.863
- But Ron sings.
- Well...

11:59.952 --> 12:01.761
He writes his own songs.

12:01.854 --> 12:04.232
- Are they about being a loser?
- Some of them.

12:04.323 --> 12:07.099
But mostly they're about
being on a tropical island

12:07.193 --> 12:11.141
and sipping some rum and feeling
the sand between your toes.

12:11.230 --> 12:14.074
What do you know about any of that, Ron?

12:14.166 --> 12:16.442
Kenneth Ellen Parcell, mind your manners.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.444
It just so happens Ron and I
have been to Key West.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.276
Oh, yes, we have.
It was on our honeymoon.

12:22.374 --> 12:23.910
We -- Oh, my --

12:24.009 --> 12:25.454
What -- Oh.

12:28.380 --> 12:32.123
You got married?! When?!

12:32.218 --> 12:33.526
Seven years ago.

12:35.254 --> 12:38.428
Look, Ken, I'm just trying
to replace your dad...

12:38.524 --> 12:41.266
Oh, damn, that's the wrong thing
to say, isn't it?

12:43.028 --> 12:46.305
If you will excuse me,
I have to get back to work.

12:51.370 --> 12:55.978
This is terrible. I've never gone
this long without talking.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.785
Okay, if we're doing a show tonight,

12:57.877 --> 13:00.118
Tracy needs to do a run-through
with the vomit rig.

13:00.212 --> 13:01.486
Props can do 4:00 --

13:01.781 --> 13:04.227
Oh, no, I promise Criss
I would be home this afternoon.

13:04.316 --> 13:08.025
Yeah, for that. And get this:
Criss wants it to be "fun."

13:08.120 --> 13:09.428
How do you make sex fun?

13:09.522 --> 13:11.024
Well, Paula never opens her eyes,

13:11.123 --> 13:13.160
so what I do is look
at a nursing-school catalog

13:13.259 --> 13:14.465
I keep under my pillow.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.470
Ugh!

13:16.495 --> 13:18.270
This "five shows a week" thing
is bonkers.

13:18.364 --> 13:21.368
So, great, let's all figure out
when I can have sex.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.505
Okay, what if Jenna
did her DVD commentary

13:24.804 --> 13:26.374
while she was getting vajazzled?

13:26.472 --> 13:28.213
Then we can move the prop meeting up --

13:28.307 --> 13:30.116
You know what? We have to look
at the whole month.

13:34.213 --> 13:36.887
Oh, yeah.
There it is.

13:36.982 --> 13:40.862
I need to cross-reference this
with my menstruation.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.598
Ooh, this is complicated. Um...

13:45.891 --> 13:47.461
I'm gonna to color-code all of this.

13:47.560 --> 13:52.532
Tracy will be red, Jenna is blue,
and I will be green --

13:54.366 --> 13:56.505
Oh, yeah, that's nice.

13:56.602 --> 13:59.412
It's, um...

13:59.505 --> 14:01.985
Mm, it's getting hot in here, right?

14:02.074 --> 14:06.045
If I had a column
for my basal body temperature,

14:06.145 --> 14:10.355
then I could schedule
around peak ovulation --

14:10.449 --> 14:11.553
Right there.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.387
Yes! That is the spot!

14:13.485 --> 14:16.432
Oh, God, this whole thing
can be a spreadsheet.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.435
If we print it in landscape,
the page will take it all!

14:19.525 --> 14:22.529
Oh, yeah.
It'll take it all.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.234
Oh, my God.

14:26.031 --> 14:26.566
Hi.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.208
Hey! That was $10!

14:29.335 --> 14:31.645
I think I figured out what's been
missing from my sex life.

14:31.937 --> 14:33.143
Organizing it.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.247
- Cooter? Cooter Berger?
- Hi, Jack.

14:40.346 --> 14:42.519
I took the liberty
of making myself a drink.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.960
Is that red wine with tonic water
and olives in it?

14:46.051 --> 14:48.053
Yeah. It's an Old Spanish!

14:49.188 --> 14:50.428
Is that not a thing?

14:51.090 --> 14:53.661
Oh, the guys at the office
told me it was a cool drink.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.996
Well, I'm always getting pranked.

14:56.095 --> 14:58.132
Anyway...

14:58.264 --> 14:59.174
Ow.

14:59.265 --> 15:01.074
So, what have you been up to?

15:01.166 --> 15:04.170
Well, after 2008,
I went back to being a lobbyist.

15:04.270 --> 15:06.147
You know, just hanging out
in hotel lobbies.

15:06.238 --> 15:09.014
If you wear a red vest, sometimes
people think you're a valet

15:09.108 --> 15:10.610
and you can take a nap in their car.

15:10.910 --> 15:11.479
Right.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.353
Well, it looks like
you're back on your feet.

15:14.446 --> 15:16.357
And how!
You're looking at the Deputy Chief

15:16.448 --> 15:19.292
of Media Relations Romney-Dunston 2012.

15:19.385 --> 15:20.625
Here, have a sticker.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.060
Cooter, this is a puffy frog
with googly eyes.

15:24.156 --> 15:26.932
Oh, no. I've been handing
those out all day!

15:28.594 --> 15:31.006
Listen, Jack, the reason I'm here,

15:31.096 --> 15:33.702
we need to talk about this whole
Bob Dunston-TGS thing.

15:33.999 --> 15:35.501
Yes, I'm taking care of that.

15:35.634 --> 15:39.411
I assure you there will be no more
Bob Dunston sketches on TGS.

15:39.505 --> 15:41.382
No, no no!
That's not what we want.

15:41.473 --> 15:44.352
We need you to make fun of Dunston
as much as possible.

15:44.443 --> 15:45.387
What? Why?

15:45.477 --> 15:47.388
Because it's making him likeable.

15:47.479 --> 15:50.153
He's actually very mean.
But with Tracy Jordan playing him --

15:50.249 --> 15:51.489
He's a lovable buffoon.

15:51.583 --> 15:54.029
Exactly! Nobody's talking
about the Governor's record.

15:54.119 --> 15:56.224
His re-segregation
of the Alabama schools.

15:56.322 --> 15:58.734
His longtime sexual relationship
with the Hank Williams statue

15:59.024 --> 16:00.367
outside Montgomery City Hall.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.564
They're just talking
about how funny Tracy is.

16:02.661 --> 16:05.471
It's a win-win. You help us
take back the White House,

16:05.564 --> 16:07.305
and you goose NBC's ratings!

16:07.399 --> 16:09.970
Yes, and I do want NBC
to get good ratings.

16:10.069 --> 16:12.572
Yeah, I know!
Let's keep saying things we want --

16:12.671 --> 16:15.982
A closer friendship with you
that includes road trips. Your turn.

16:21.046 --> 16:23.652
Jenna, can we trouble you
for some advice?

16:23.749 --> 16:26.355
Yes. If you're only in New York
for a few days,

16:26.452 --> 16:28.625
find a way to see
Amar'e Stoudemire's penis.

16:28.721 --> 16:29.597
It's worth it.

16:29.688 --> 16:32.032
All right, but we'd like
to talk to you about Kenny.

16:32.124 --> 16:33.000
He won't speak to me.

16:33.092 --> 16:36.039
Don, Garlene, I don't have time for this.

16:36.128 --> 16:37.232
I'm trying to write a new album

16:37.329 --> 16:39.366
for the only people
who buy records anymore --

16:39.465 --> 16:42.378
Unhappy, middle-aged bummers like you.

16:42.468 --> 16:44.414
This writing is hard.

16:45.004 --> 16:48.008
Wait! You said you write songs.

16:48.107 --> 16:51.418
Yes, I do, but I'm not
a professional like you

16:51.510 --> 16:53.786
or the bears at showbiz Pizza.

16:54.079 --> 16:55.217
Sing one for me now.

16:55.314 --> 16:56.554
For inspiration.

16:56.648 --> 16:57.718
I'm not gonna steal it.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.156
But if I do, don't even bother
lawyering up.

17:00.252 --> 17:03.165
I'll have my juice on you so fast,
you'll think you're an Asian girl.

17:04.757 --> 17:10.105
Well, okay. I wrote this song
earlier today for Kenny.

17:10.194 --> 17:12.732
You know, I just hope someday
he'll realize --

17:13.031 --> 17:14.271
<i>Okay.</i>

17:14.366 --> 17:15.106
<i># Ooh #</i>

17:15.200 --> 17:17.406
<i># There's picture on my wall #</i>

17:17.502 --> 17:18.277
<i># Ooh #</i>

17:18.369 --> 17:20.611
<i># Of a boy who's just yay tall #</i>

17:20.705 --> 17:22.117
<i># Ooh #</i>

17:22.207 --> 17:24.517
<i># Without a daddy, he's in danger #</i>

17:24.609 --> 17:26.714
<i># He needs an older male stranger #</i>

17:26.811 --> 17:29.418
<i># And when he goes to war #</i>

17:29.515 --> 17:31.119
Okay, I'm going to stop you right there.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.093
Ron, that was terrible.

17:33.185 --> 17:34.687
I'm gonna be constructive here.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.700
- You should kill yourself.
- No, he should not.

17:38.323 --> 17:41.270
I am sorry, Ms. Maroney,
but you don't talk to Ron like that.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.566
What are you talking about?

17:42.661 --> 17:44.368
I've heard you call Ron a dingleberry!

17:44.463 --> 17:46.773
Comparing Ron
to our inconsiderate neighbors,

17:47.066 --> 17:49.444
the Dingleberrys, is something I can do.

17:49.535 --> 17:51.446
But you are not allowed to

17:51.537 --> 17:55.508
because you are not a part of our family.

17:55.607 --> 17:57.245
That's what family is, Kenneth --

17:57.342 --> 17:59.618
People you badmouth all the time
behind their back.

17:59.711 --> 18:01.088
Why, on the train up here,

18:01.180 --> 18:03.490
I called you "a bowling pin
with a face drawn on it."

18:03.582 --> 18:06.461
"A cheap albino lesbian."
"A finger with teeth."

18:06.552 --> 18:08.122
"A Hummel someone left
on the radiator" --

18:08.220 --> 18:08.823
I get it, Mom!

18:09.121 --> 18:11.192
But if anyone else says
a word about you, Kenneth,

18:11.290 --> 18:13.099
I don't stand for it!

18:13.192 --> 18:15.536
Do you remember that kid in school
who bullied you?

18:15.627 --> 18:17.607
Well, I ate that goat.

18:17.696 --> 18:19.801
Because you and I are family.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.807
And like it or not, Kenneth,
so are you and my husband.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.410
Ronald McDonnell.

18:27.339 --> 18:29.683
Well...

18:29.775 --> 18:31.550
Oh...

18:33.245 --> 18:35.350
I think I just got an idea for a song.

18:35.447 --> 18:38.291
It's called "Rum-Soaked Tampon".

18:38.383 --> 18:40.454
Now what were you guys talking about?

18:40.552 --> 18:44.591
<i># Hey, girl #</i>

18:44.690 --> 18:49.537
<i># Me and you #</i>

18:49.628 --> 18:52.268
<i># Yeah, baby #</i>

18:52.364 --> 18:55.311
<i># This is just more proof #</i>

18:55.400 --> 18:59.473
<i># That I am an amazing singer #</i>

18:59.571 --> 19:03.576
<i># Does this song
make you want to do it? #</i>

19:03.675 --> 19:06.781
<i># You're welcome #</i>

19:06.879 --> 19:09.189
<i># Girl #</i>

19:09.281 --> 19:14.924
<i># You're so beautiful
and so is the guy you're with #</i>

19:15.220 --> 19:18.667
<i># I just want to lick your face #</i>

19:18.757 --> 19:21.397
Hey! Where do you think you are,
Office Max?

19:21.493 --> 19:23.871
Get out of here, you perverts!

19:26.165 --> 19:28.167
<i>Two minutes. Two minutes to air.</i>

19:28.400 --> 19:30.437
Lemon, where have you been?!
You have a show to do.

19:30.536 --> 19:33.346
Don't worry about the show.
It's all scheduled.

19:33.438 --> 19:36.214
Look at this.
Oh, yeah. Mommy like.

19:36.642 --> 19:37.677
What's wrong with you?

19:37.776 --> 19:39.517
I solved my intimacy issues, Jack.

19:39.611 --> 19:41.249
Now that the show is on every night,

19:41.346 --> 19:43.257
everything has to be organized...

19:45.751 --> 19:46.695
Well, congratulations.

19:46.785 --> 19:49.823
I just want to make sure that you're
doing a Bob Dunston sketch tonight.

19:50.656 --> 19:52.897
- Why?
- Because of the, ah, First Amendment.

19:53.192 --> 19:53.829
Which I love.

19:53.926 --> 19:56.839
And what you told me earlier.
You convinced me. You win.

19:56.929 --> 19:59.375
You think I'm an idiot?
I didn't win that argument.

19:59.464 --> 20:00.499
I'm an idiot!

20:01.767 --> 20:04.441
Lemon, what do you want me to say?

20:04.536 --> 20:06.675
You're helping
the Romney-Dunston ticket, okay?

20:06.772 --> 20:08.683
People like Dunston
because they like Tracy.

20:08.774 --> 20:11.220
What? No. If these sketches
are helping Romney,

20:11.310 --> 20:12.516
we're not doing them!

20:12.611 --> 20:13.783
Yes. Maybe that's for the best.

20:13.879 --> 20:14.823
The success of your show

20:14.913 --> 20:16.517
is the only thing keeping Hank
from selling NBC.

20:16.615 --> 20:18.788
And if he doesn't sell,
I'll spend the rest of my career

20:18.884 --> 20:21.228
in corporate obscurity,
like a woman with children.

20:21.620 --> 20:24.328
Damn it! If I don't help Romney,
it's four more years

20:24.423 --> 20:26.460
of socialism,
corporations not being people,

20:26.558 --> 20:28.367
and a basketball court
at the White House!

20:28.460 --> 20:30.531
Let me make your choice easy, Jack.
It's over.

20:30.629 --> 20:32.438
Yes, but is it that easy?

20:32.531 --> 20:35.808
You stop doing Dunston,
TGS goes back to one night a week,

20:35.901 --> 20:38.609
you can kiss good-bye
your Dusseldorf bus schedule sex.

20:38.704 --> 20:40.741
You'll be having Paris Metro sex!

20:40.839 --> 20:42.750
Long sessions of afternoon love-making,

20:42.841 --> 20:44.684
followed by talking and making circles

20:44.776 --> 20:46.585
with your finger in Criss's chest hair!

20:46.678 --> 20:47.816
No! You can't make me!

20:47.913 --> 20:50.723
Do the sketch, I help Romney,
but I ruin my career.

20:50.816 --> 20:54.559
Cut the sketch, you help Obama,
but you screw up your life plan.

20:55.854 --> 20:56.855
It's a win-lose.

20:56.955 --> 20:58.798
<i>Tracy to the floor
for the cold open.</i>

20:58.890 --> 21:00.028
So what are we going to do?

21:02.828 --> 21:04.705
- Break a leg, Tray.
- That shouldn't be hard.

21:04.796 --> 21:06.901
I have a severe calcium deficiency!

21:18.577 --> 21:21.615
When? I'm glad you brought up my record.

21:21.713 --> 21:26.458
It's called "Sounds of Seduction."
And it's available on iTunes.

21:26.551 --> 21:29.532
There are nine types of legitimate rape.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.726
One, a Halloween party.

21:31.823 --> 21:34.531
Let me ask you a question, sir.

21:34.626 --> 21:37.903
Do you know if this auditorium
validates parking?

21:37.996 --> 21:40.636
Our opponent would like you to believe

21:40.732 --> 21:42.439
that Mitt Romney is a merman.

21:42.534 --> 21:46.414
Now, I know Mitt Romney
does not live in the sea.

21:46.605 --> 21:48.482
No, Mormon, Governor.

21:48.573 --> 21:51.417
A Mormon?
Now, that's crazy!
