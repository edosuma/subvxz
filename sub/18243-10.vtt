10:50.214 --> 10:51.738
You need to read
the books.

10:51.825 --> 10:53.653
Amy tried to
explain them to me,

10:53.740 --> 10:56.830
but I got lost when everyone
started time traveling.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.832
Amy? Please.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.529
Trudith Winters'
nuanced storytelling

11:00.616 --> 11:03.184
is lost on

11:03.271 --> 11:05.621
Amy loves those books
almost as much as you do.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.667
You could have
invited her.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.190
To father-daughter day?

11:09.277 --> 11:11.105
That is crazy talk
is what that is.

11:11.192 --> 11:13.411
You know what?
Let's make it
a double feature.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.196
I'm gonna cancel my
woodworking class.

11:15.283 --> 11:16.719
- Really?
- Sure.

11:16.806 --> 11:18.068
Monkey Bites?

11:24.727 --> 11:27.730
Mm, these are great.
I thought I knew
all the primo candy.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.993
Amy got me started on them.
They're her favorite.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.038
Oh.

11:32.561 --> 11:34.302
Okay,
they are pretty good.

11:34.389 --> 11:35.782
Hey, Darbs.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.522
Thanks for ditching
your friends for me.

11:37.609 --> 11:38.959
It'll be good for them.

11:39.046 --> 11:40.395
They need to learn how to
have fun without me.

I've really needed
a day like this.

who are trying to curse us.
[chuckles]

12:53.250 --> 12:54.686
I totally agree.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.297
So, what's next
on your list?

12:56.384 --> 12:58.125
I'll let you decide.

12:58.212 --> 13:01.171
We can either have
a disco dance party,
or do yoga.

13:01.258 --> 13:02.390
Either is fine by me.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.784
Really?

You know, you're very
agreeable today.

13:07.525 --> 13:09.701
You're right. I am.

13:09.789 --> 13:13.314
So far,
everything you've picked
has been a lot of fun.

13:13.401 --> 13:14.881
In that case,

13:14.968 --> 13:16.317
let's bring disco back.

13:23.411 --> 13:24.586
I'll be honest.

13:24.673 --> 13:26.370
Disco was never really
my thing.

13:26.457 --> 13:28.895
Can I maybe interest you
in some Blondie?

13:28.982 --> 13:31.636
You can dance
to her music.
Kind of.

13:31.723 --> 13:33.160
Maybe I left it over--

13:33.247 --> 13:37.991
Actually, Mr. Quinn,
we really wanted pure disco.

13:38.078 --> 13:41.168
Right. Um, Dad,
do you think they
might be over here?

13:43.692 --> 13:45.955

some James Brown?

13:46.042 --> 13:49.785

- Actually, um, no.

13:49.872 --> 13:52.135
He's funk, not disco.
Sorry.

13:55.399 --> 13:56.879
- ABBA.
- What?

13:56.966 --> 14:00.013
ABBA Live.
Solid gold disco.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.666
Come on,

14:16.072 --> 14:18.074
I wish every movie
had your commentary.

14:18.161 --> 14:21.338
How often do you get
two private screenings
in a row?

14:21.425 --> 14:24.689
Must be the summer heat.
Everybody just wants to
stay inside.

14:24.776 --> 14:26.822
That explains why it was
a ghost town outside,

14:26.909 --> 14:28.650
but you'd think people
would want to be in

14:28.737 --> 14:30.739

the movie theater has or--

14:30.826 --> 14:31.914

- [bell jingles]

14:32.001 --> 14:33.046

just a second ago?

14:38.225 --> 14:39.617
I didn't notice.
Who cares?

14:39.704 --> 14:41.793
Just means I have you
all to myself.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.797
Kelly.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.843
Um, why don't you
grab a seat,

14:47.930 --> 14:49.192
and I'll find Mama P.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.981
Mama P,
we have a problem.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.330
Yes, we do.

14:56.417 --> 14:57.897
I don't know what you did

14:57.984 --> 15:00.160
or why I feel like taking
a walk in the park,

15:00.247 --> 15:02.423
but if you don't fix it
by closing, lock up.

15:14.087 --> 15:15.871
Kelly, what did you do?

15:15.958 --> 15:17.481
Those brownies were magic.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.048
Just your dad's.

15:19.135 --> 15:20.876
It was a Single Serving
Cinnamon Brownie Bite

15:20.963 --> 15:23.139
so he'd make time for you.

15:23.226 --> 15:25.054
He always
makes time for me.

15:25.141 --> 15:27.056
Now he'll make
more time for you.

15:27.143 --> 15:28.144
Have you had a nice day?

15:28.231 --> 15:29.667
It's been perfect.

15:29.754 --> 15:30.973
But that's not the point.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.540
This spell worked too well.

15:32.627 --> 15:34.846
He cancelled his class,
people are avoiding us,

15:34.934 --> 15:36.674
- and now--
- Calm down.

15:36.761 --> 15:39.590
The spell uses torian,
so it should wear off
at 7:30.

15:39.677 --> 15:41.157
Well, what am I
supposed to do until then?

15:41.244 --> 15:43.899
Enjoy hanging out
with your dad.

15:43.986 --> 15:46.032
You spelled
Mr. O'Brien?

15:46.119 --> 15:48.773
I was just trying to
give Darbie a good day
with her dad.

15:48.860 --> 15:51.951
You spelled your dad,
too, didn't you?

15:52.038 --> 15:54.605
I saw the dollhouse.

15:54.692 --> 15:56.390
We're really low
on some spices.

15:56.477 --> 16:00.002
Okay, yes.
It was a small spell,
Concur With Me Cookies,

16:00.089 --> 16:02.048
to make my dad
a better negotiator.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.658
Trust me,
he needed it.

16:03.745 --> 16:05.007
That's why you said that

16:05.094 --> 16:07.705
you'd do everything
I wanted today.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.969
Your spell made everyone
agree with your dad,

16:10.056 --> 16:12.754
but then you became
overly agreeable.

16:12.841 --> 16:14.234
You suffered the downside.

16:14.321 --> 16:16.323
I didn't suffer.
I had a blast today.

16:16.410 --> 16:19.021
Your list was
tons of fun.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.414
Okay, updating our
internet passwords

16:20.501 --> 16:21.981
wasn't exactly thrilling,

16:22.068 --> 16:24.026
but you were right,
I really needed to do it.

16:24.113 --> 16:26.463
You're using
too much magic.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.552
I have it under control.
Both spells use torian,

16:28.639 --> 16:30.163
so they wear off.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.643
- But that's not the point.
- Then what is?

16:32.730 --> 16:35.168
We all had awesome days.
I'd call that a win.

16:35.255 --> 16:37.344
I call it reckless.

16:37.431 --> 16:38.823
[sighs]
You sound like Grandma.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.956
You know,
your grandma's right.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.046
I'm going home.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.926
Something wrong
with the dessert?

16:55.014 --> 16:57.581
Just not in the mood
for it, I guess.

16:57.668 --> 16:59.279
Honey, what's goin' on?

16:59.366 --> 17:03.152
It's just that I was having
a really amazing time today.

17:03.239 --> 17:04.980
Me, too.
It's been great.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.069
But did you really
enjoy it,

17:07.156 --> 17:09.637

seminars and Amy.

wave a magic wand,

17:21.387 --> 17:23.433
and make all my
obligations disappear.

17:47.283 --> 17:49.111
I didn't realize
how late it is.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.200

take Amy to a play
for her birthday.

Amy's birthday,

17:52.854 --> 17:53.898

gone out to dinner with
my parents tonight.

throw me a party.

It's still early.
Let's, uh, go out--

18:16.007 --> 18:19.446
But I wanted to spend
my birthday with you.

18:19.533 --> 18:22.579
I'm a jerk.
I'd be angry, too.

18:22.666 --> 18:24.364
You're not a jerk.

more time with his daughter.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.630
I'm not angry about that.

18:29.717 --> 18:32.111
I'm hurt that you
didn't even think
to call me.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.895
Let me make it up to you.
We can--

Look, Patrick,

18:36.419 --> 18:37.681
I really like you.

18:39.466 --> 18:40.945

I want to do

is come between
you and Darbie.

right now.

all your fault.

19:01.923 --> 19:03.446
because of your
stupid spell.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.492
No, no, the spell
shouldn't have done that.

19:05.579 --> 19:07.450
I just wanted to give you two
more time together.

that sad before.

- I'm sorry, I--

I'll do whatever I can
to make it up to you,
I promise.

a spell? Now?

19:19.027 --> 19:20.724
What else can we do?

Magic did this.

19:22.204 --> 19:24.119
And magic can fix it.

Oh, we're gonna cook.

another chance.

anything like that ever again.

To Antarctica,"

Thank you.

21:03.131 --> 21:05.916
I know you already have it,
but this copy's special.

21:06.003 --> 21:07.570
Open it.

21:07.657 --> 21:09.224
[gasps]
It's autographed.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.748
But Trudith
doesn't give autographs.

21:11.835 --> 21:13.097
How did you get this?

21:13.184 --> 21:15.404
It's no biggie.
We used to be besties.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.278
Thank you so much.

21:19.365 --> 21:22.237
I know my dad's
supposed to take you to see
the new "Doomed" movie.

21:22.324 --> 21:23.456
Do you think
he can stand

21:23.543 --> 21:24.935
sitting through it
a second time?

21:25.022 --> 21:27.590
That's the thing.
He didn't really get it.

21:27.677 --> 21:29.288
I'm going again tomorrow,

21:29.375 --> 21:32.682
and I thought it might be nice
to go see it with a real fan.

21:32.769 --> 21:33.988
I'd love that.

21:39.385 --> 21:41.082
I came as soon as
I got your message.

21:41.169 --> 21:42.692
What's the emergency?

21:42.779 --> 21:45.695
Hannah and Darbie have
something to tell you,
Becky.

21:45.782 --> 21:47.610
Where's Kelly?

21:47.697 --> 21:50.831
We need to talk
about Kelly.

21:50.918 --> 21:52.354
We think she has
a problem.

21:59.143 --> 22:00.231
I'm sorry.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.277
What for?

22:02.364 --> 22:04.453
You were right.

22:04.540 --> 22:07.761
I shouldn't take pleasure
in someone else's pain.

22:07.848 --> 22:09.589
I just don't get it.

22:09.676 --> 22:11.417
You hate Chuck because
he stole your morbium?

22:11.504 --> 22:17.118
No. There's always a chance
I can get that back, but...

22:17.205 --> 22:19.468
I-- I hate Chuck
because--

22:26.127 --> 22:29.391
Did I ever tell you
he got my father fired
from his job?

22:29.478 --> 22:31.480
Chuck framed him
for stealing, right?

22:31.567 --> 22:34.309
And because he used magic,

22:34.396 --> 22:36.659
no one believed
my dad was innocent.

22:36.746 --> 22:39.227
And that one cruel act

22:39.314 --> 22:42.883
started a domino effect
that shattered my family.

22:42.970 --> 22:45.059
And the worst part is,
he didn't even know my dad.

22:45.146 --> 22:48.279
He was just trying to
scare us into
giving him the book.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.586
Well, I didn't know
about your family.

22:50.673 --> 22:52.066
I'm sorry.

22:52.153 --> 22:55.548
Now that Chuck's trapped
in Lavender Heights,

22:55.635 --> 22:59.769
maybe it's time for me
to stop being trapped
in the past.

22:59.856 --> 23:01.075
You think you could ever
forgive him?

23:01.162 --> 23:03.164
Not a chance.

23:03.251 --> 23:04.600
I get it.

23:04.687 --> 23:06.297
There's nothing
more important than family.

23:08.256 --> 23:09.649
I should be
more honest with you.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.783
After all,
you're the closest thing
I have to family.

23:17.047 --> 23:18.745
[clears throat]
I-- I have to run an errand.

23:18.832 --> 23:20.877
Uh, get back to sweeping.
This place is a mess.
