00:10.684 --> 00:12.968
<i>My name is detective
Brett Hopper,</i>

00:13.377 --> 00:15.661
<i>and this is the day
that changes everything.</i>

00:15.917 --> 00:17.024
Freeze !
Put your hands up !

00:17.075 --> 00:19.957
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.

00:20.053 --> 00:21.960
<i>I will be framed
for murder...</i>

00:22.159 --> 00:23.875
Who the hell are you people ?

00:24.075 --> 00:26.217
<i>My girlfriend Rita
will be in danger.</i>

00:26.609 --> 00:29.530
<i>I know all this because
I am living the same day...</i>

00:29.776 --> 00:31.329
<i>over and over again.</i>

00:31.427 --> 00:34.480
<i>The day is the same,
but different things happen.</i>

00:34.732 --> 00:36.233
<i>Every morning,
I get another chance.</i>

00:36.324 --> 00:38.747
<i>For every decision,
there's a consequence.</i>

00:38.837 --> 00:41.798
<i>- I can save my sister Jennifer...</i>
- You're acting really crazy.

00:41.883 --> 00:43.727
- There isn't any time.
- What is this about ?

00:43.732 --> 00:45.692
<i>I can track down every lead.</i>

00:46.540 --> 00:48.360
<i>Hopper, you should have received
the package today.</i>

00:48.497 --> 00:51.198
The message on your answering machine
came from the home of a U.S. attorney,

00:51.202 --> 00:53.990
Nathan Baxter. Anything else
you're not telling me, partner ?

00:54.088 --> 00:55.419
<i>But today,
I need some answers...</i>

00:55.469 --> 00:57.500
You called and left me
a message about this package.

00:57.553 --> 00:59.946
- Who told you to call me ?
- Garza.

01:00.408 --> 01:02.676
<i>Before it's too late.</i>
If I can get here earlier tomorrow,

01:02.759 --> 01:03.867
I might be able to help her.

01:03.909 --> 01:06.982
Hopper, I need your help.
I've done something terrible.

01:07.590 --> 01:08.760
+

01:13.950 --> 01:15.077
I love you.

01:15.859 --> 01:16.997
I love you, too.

01:17.231 --> 01:18.855
When will I see you again ?

01:20.759 --> 01:21.962
Tomorrow.

01:22.640 --> 01:23.979
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:28.893 --> 01:30.913
- Rita ?
<i>- Hopper, I need your help.</i>

01:32.296 --> 01:33.867
I've done something terrible.

01:34.024 --> 01:36.674
<i>Andrea, tell me what happened.</i>

01:37.361 --> 01:38.583
It's Eddie...

01:40.517 --> 01:42.056
I think I killed him.

01:49.744 --> 01:51.705
All right, why don't you
take me through it ?

01:52.352 --> 01:53.611
He came over.

01:53.789 --> 01:55.012
He was high.

01:55.823 --> 01:57.303
He was tweaking so bad.

01:57.605 --> 01:59.301
He got violent and...

02:00.217 --> 02:01.571
I fought back.

02:02.352 --> 02:03.444
And...

02:04.053 --> 02:05.906
he went over.

02:17.064 --> 02:18.366
God, he's dead.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.745
- This is my fault.
- No, no, it's not.

02:21.150 --> 02:22.940
We both knew
what Eddie was into.

02:23.125 --> 02:26.605
- I didn't mean to kill him.
- Just stop it. He brought this here.

02:27.175 --> 02:28.617
You were defending yourself.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.793
We're gonna fix this.

02:36.477 --> 02:38.045
We'll leave him
at his apartment.

02:38.712 --> 02:41.956
There's a pay phone around the corner.
We can call 9-1-1 from there.

02:43.680 --> 02:44.710
You okay ?

02:44.809 --> 02:47.221
I know you've got problems
of your own, Hopper.

02:49.556 --> 02:51.500
I just didn't know
where else to turn.

02:51.879 --> 02:53.236
He was my partner, too.

02:55.437 --> 02:57.109
When was the last time
you talked to him ?

02:57.212 --> 02:58.509
Couple months, maybe.

02:59.456 --> 03:02.164
- You know if he was still using ?
- I don't know.

03:02.267 --> 03:06.050
I mean, how long did we work with him
before either of us realized, right ?

03:07.244 --> 03:08.665
Eddie had his secrets.

03:10.262 --> 03:12.303
I didn't feel a pulse,
I swear to God.

03:12.334 --> 03:14.536
- Hang in there, man.
- We gotta get him to a hospital.

03:14.608 --> 03:16.992
St. Francis is the closest one,
but it's the other way.

03:17.093 --> 03:18.775
St. Francis.
Okay.

03:22.981 --> 03:24.557
You're gonna be okay, man.

03:35.965 --> 03:38.542
- Oh, no...
- I can lose him.

03:38.641 --> 03:41.352
No, if we run, he'll have
a bird on us in minutes.

03:41.875 --> 03:44.901
- I don't think Eddie's got minutes.
- So we can't waste'em by going nascar

03:44.905 --> 03:46.558
against a black and white.
Just be cool.

03:46.658 --> 03:47.930
All right, hang in there, man.

03:48.029 --> 03:50.058
We're gonna get you some help.
Hang in.

03:56.852 --> 03:59.629
Narcotics. These are my partners.
We're on the job.

04:00.643 --> 04:02.960
- What happened to him ?
- He was U.C. on a buy bust.

04:02.973 --> 04:05.356
Took a hit from a couple of bangers.
We're trying to get him to the hospital

04:05.361 --> 04:07.351
Let's go. We've got
an injured officer here.

04:08.084 --> 04:09.816
6-l-14, I've got an injured officer

04:09.915 --> 04:11.952
at Alvarado and Glendale
with his partners.

04:12.055 --> 04:14.123
Show me escorting
to St. Francis memorial hospital.

04:14.221 --> 04:15.769
Code three.
Follow me.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.757
You know I can't go in there.

04:20.857 --> 04:22.024
I know.

04:22.124 --> 04:24.126
I got this.

04:31.081 --> 04:33.868
Need  some help over here !
Come on, this side, this side.

04:36.118 --> 04:37.674
Where's your other partner ?

05:02.422 --> 05:03.618
Brett ?

05:06.269 --> 05:07.991
- Hey.
- I didn't hear you get up.

05:08.090 --> 05:09.602
I just... I didn't want
to wake you.

05:09.704 --> 05:11.271
I like when you wake me.

05:11.373 --> 05:14.234
Now you're all dressed,
and I've missed all the good parts.

05:15.947 --> 05:17.398
That's a good part, too.

05:20.733 --> 05:22.558
Baby girl, I'm trying
to get an early start.

05:22.658 --> 05:24.773
But save me some of that
for later, all right ?

05:25.334 --> 05:27.573
Well, later
it might be all gone.

05:29.132 --> 05:31.124
Sweetie, it was...
it was just a joke.

05:31.905 --> 05:33.298
No, I know.
I just...

05:34.436 --> 05:36.629
I got a...
I got a lot on my mind.

05:37.158 --> 05:38.632
You wanna tell me about it ?

05:40.227 --> 05:44.253
It's Andrea. I think she may be caught up
in something with Eddie Reyes.

05:44.351 --> 05:47.014
Eddie ? I haven't heard
his name since he got fired.

05:47.116 --> 05:49.000
Well, he popped up yesterday.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.944
So what exactly
are those two caught up in ?

05:52.044 --> 05:54.292
I don't know.
Trying to figure that out.

05:54.442 --> 05:56.267
Eddie's had
a rough time of it.

05:56.668 --> 05:58.119
I hope he's not
in any more trouble.

05:58.221 --> 06:01.639
Please. Eddie ain't nothing
but trouble. I gotta go.

06:02.008 --> 06:04.134
I have to see this lady
about a package.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.683
- Lady ?
- It's evidence.

06:08.970 --> 06:10.221
Might be important.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.272
Hey, I know this is
a little bit out of the blue.

06:32.371 --> 06:33.938
You gotta stay away
from Eddie today.

06:34.042 --> 06:35.551
What the hell are
you talking about ?

06:35.633 --> 06:39.042
I think he's using again.
Listen, if he calls, don't pick up.

06:39.141 --> 06:41.400
If he comes over,
do not let him in.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.540
- Where are you getting this ?
- Just trust me.

06:43.917 --> 06:46.023
Stay away from Eddie today.
Okay ?

06:46.287 --> 06:47.921
Okay, yeah, I got it.

06:54.831 --> 06:55.853
Who was that ?

06:56.596 --> 06:57.598
Hopper.

06:59.005 --> 07:00.888
He says I should stay
away from you.

07:02.650 --> 07:03.931
Typical Hopper.

07:08.850 --> 07:09.750
+

07:13.979 --> 07:15.885
All I'm saying is,
why today ?

07:16.569 --> 07:18.359
The same day that
you gotta go to I.A.,

07:18.459 --> 07:22.193
he calls out of the blue to talk
about me. He's gotta know something.

07:22.294 --> 07:24.677
Then why didn't he say
something about us ?

07:24.904 --> 07:26.903
He did. He said
to stay away from me.

07:28.061 --> 07:30.960
You know how Hopper gets an idea
in his head, he can't let it go.

07:31.137 --> 07:33.147
You mean, like,
how he got me canned ?

07:34.570 --> 07:36.695
Come on.
You know that's not true.

07:39.260 --> 07:40.935
Thought  you were on my side.

07:41.486 --> 07:42.419
I am.

07:42.521 --> 07:43.976
Come on, baby.

07:45.370 --> 07:47.917
I'm just worried about you, you know ?
You just said so yourself,

07:48.018 --> 07:50.756
Hopper gets an idea in his head,
he doesn't let it go.

07:51.114 --> 07:52.884
He's going to I.A. today, too,

07:53.741 --> 07:55.810
and what if he knows
what you've been doing ?

07:56.131 --> 07:56.961
He doesn't.

07:57.061 --> 07:59.934
Then why call this morning and
tell you to stay away from me ?

08:04.942 --> 08:06.715
Is there something
you're not telling me ?

08:06.815 --> 08:07.959
Like what ?

08:08.961 --> 08:10.673
Come on, baby, of course not.

08:11.802 --> 08:13.426
You've seen me at my worst,

08:14.494 --> 08:15.640
spun out.

08:17.467 --> 08:19.256
There's nothing
I can hide from you.

08:27.617 --> 08:29.988
Hey, how about I take you
to La Cabanita tonight ?

08:30.086 --> 08:32.451
- You know you don't have to.
- I know. I'd like to.

08:32.541 --> 08:34.446
Even a rent-a-cop can afford that.

08:50.284 --> 08:52.947
They played me some voice mail,
a woman talking about some package

08:52.994 --> 08:55.509
they sent to you. They think it has
something to do with Garza.

08:55.563 --> 08:58.292
You called and left me
a message about this package.

09:55.579 --> 09:58.452
- Ava, I'm Brett Hopper.
- How did you find me ?

09:58.551 --> 10:00.552
Don't worry about that.
Where's Baxter ?

10:01.016 --> 10:02.392
He's in the shower.

10:04.413 --> 10:06.045
Now I know that
you work for Garza.

10:06.157 --> 10:08.002
I know that he had you
send me a package.

10:08.113 --> 10:10.757
- I need to know why.
- Garza never told me.

10:11.835 --> 10:14.590
Why are you asking me, anyway ?
Why don't you just talk to him ?

10:15.181 --> 10:16.375
Garza's dead.

10:17.894 --> 10:19.282
He was killed last night.

10:20.724 --> 10:22.906
My God. When ?
I mean, why would anybody...

10:22.932 --> 10:26.022
Right now I'm trying to figure all that
out, but I think it may have something

10:26.030 --> 10:28.640
to do with that package you sent me.
Now please, I need you to tell me

10:28.647 --> 10:29.762
everything.

10:30.096 --> 10:32.873
Garza was acting nervous.
When he brought me the packages,

10:32.876 --> 10:34.791
they were both sealed.
I didn't see what was inside.

10:34.795 --> 10:35.883
He just said to send them.

10:35.898 --> 10:38.432
- There were two packages ?
- You didn't know ?

10:38.928 --> 10:41.280
Yeah, I sent one to you
and one to someone...

10:41.822 --> 10:43.764
someone named... Mathis.

10:45.631 --> 10:47.044
Jennifer Mathis ?

10:48.068 --> 10:49.253
You know her ?

10:50.243 --> 10:51.581
She's my sister.

10:52.113 --> 10:55.887
Put  your clothes on and get the hell
out of here. You're in danger, too.

10:56.153 --> 10:57.862
And stay away from Baxter.

11:08.608 --> 11:10.378
Wait, so you never
received a package ?

11:10.478 --> 11:13.121
- No, I haven't gotten anything.
- You never got it.

11:13.222 --> 11:15.068
- Your husband must have taken it.
- Randall ?

11:15.120 --> 11:17.094
Look, just tell Randall
I'm coming over to see him.

11:17.096 --> 11:19.298
- Brett, that doesn't... he's not here.
- Where is he ?

11:19.303 --> 11:22.078
He left work and went home.
We got a call. Our alarm went off.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.500
- What ?
- No, it's okay.

11:23.608 --> 11:26.905
- It happens by mistake...
- Stay there. I'm coming to get you.

11:36.018 --> 11:37.760
I thought you were
supposed to be at work.

11:37.764 --> 11:40.320
I was worried about you, after
your I.A. meeting, you know ?

11:40.421 --> 11:42.438
With Hopper calling
this morning and all.

11:42.648 --> 11:44.090
So what did you tell'em ?

11:45.572 --> 11:46.898
Slow down, slow down.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.162
- They know what ?
- About Slim...

11:49.551 --> 11:52.991
Everything, okay ? They've got
pictures and bank statements.

11:53.865 --> 11:55.990
I don't know what
I'm gonna do here, Eddie.

11:56.954 --> 11:59.675
- They say anything about me ?
- This is my ass we're talking about.

11:59.678 --> 12:00.978
Come on, don't be
that way, baby.

12:00.982 --> 12:03.700
- Hopper's the one who did this to us.
- This wasn't Hopper.

12:04.156 --> 12:06.013
Okay ?
Hopper's wanted for murder.

12:07.351 --> 12:09.832
- What ?
- They say he killed the A.D.A., Garza,

12:09.929 --> 12:11.663
and they want me
to help bring him in.

12:11.761 --> 12:14.971
Offered me a deal. I roll on
Hopper and they drop the case.

12:16.288 --> 12:18.432
- What're you gonna do ?
- He's my partner.

12:18.532 --> 12:21.234
What if he did it ?
Then you help bring down a murderer,

12:21.257 --> 12:23.354
- and you walk away clean.
- And what if he didn't ?

12:23.359 --> 12:26.526
Then you help prove his innocence, right ?
And everybody wins.

12:26.627 --> 12:28.434
- Eddie, I can't...
- No, baby, no.

12:28.536 --> 12:30.287
You take this deal,
I.A. goes away.

12:30.388 --> 12:33.203
Slim goes away.
I can try and clear my record.

12:33.302 --> 12:35.752
I mean, this could be
a second chance for both of us.

12:35.796 --> 12:38.142
Look, I didn't roll on you,
and I'm not gonna do it to Hopper.

12:38.144 --> 12:40.412
Is there any time you don't side
with that guy ? They just told you

12:40.419 --> 12:43.733
he killed somebody, and yet you're
still backing him. What about us ?

12:46.203 --> 12:47.694
Why are you looking
at me like that ?

12:47.697 --> 12:48.999
Are you using again ?

12:49.119 --> 12:52.642
You think I'd do that to myself,
to you, after everything you've done ?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.675
- It's just a question.
- No...

12:55.314 --> 12:57.273
No, that's a question
that Hopper put there, right ?

12:57.278 --> 12:58.789
That's what he told you
this morning.

12:58.795 --> 13:01.329
So he doesn't just get me fired,
he gets to ruin us.

13:02.659 --> 13:04.784
Probably just take his side
on that one, too ?

13:08.596 --> 13:12.070
Randall, it's me again.
Call me.

13:14.465 --> 13:15.852
This isn't like him.

13:18.271 --> 13:19.678
I'm gonna kill him.

13:20.650 --> 13:22.217
- What ?
- Nothing.

13:22.318 --> 13:24.087
Don't "nothing" me.

13:24.169 --> 13:26.823
You pull me out of class, you drag me
home and then you won't even tell me

13:26.826 --> 13:30.112
- what the hell's going on.
- I would if I knew, but for now,

13:30.597 --> 13:32.988
- you're safer with me.
- Safer ?

13:33.148 --> 13:36.183
What are you talking about ?
Are we in some kind of danger ?

13:37.098 --> 13:38.645
- Is Randall ?
- I don't know.

13:38.756 --> 13:40.363
I can totally tell
when you're lying...

13:40.369 --> 13:42.952
I just wish you'd be a little bit
more worried about yourself

13:43.062 --> 13:44.777
and a little less
about your husband.

13:44.875 --> 13:46.781
What is that supposed to mean ?

13:50.352 --> 13:51.679
That's  Randall's car.

13:57.268 --> 13:58.718
Jen, wait... let...

13:59.109 --> 14:01.291
hold... Let me check out
the house first.

14:02.358 --> 14:03.206
Yeah.

14:03.328 --> 14:04.379
Hopper, we need to talk.

14:04.479 --> 14:06.662
Yeah, I'm a little busy
right now, Andrea.

14:06.772 --> 14:09.604
Look, you called me this morning,
okay ? I need your help.

14:11.143 --> 14:12.675
Andrea, I gotta call you back.

14:20.850 --> 14:21.750
+

14:31.030 --> 14:33.778
The whole place is tossed.
Nobody's here.

14:34.771 --> 14:36.955
Why would anybody
do this to us ?

14:38.111 --> 14:40.216
I think they're looking
for that package.

14:41.208 --> 14:42.813
Do you think
they have Randall ?

14:43.124 --> 14:45.107
- Forget Randall.
- What ?

14:45.207 --> 14:47.351
For all we know,
he could be involved in this.

14:47.452 --> 14:49.161
What is wrong with you ?

14:49.274 --> 14:52.461
My house is turned upside down,
my husband is missing

14:52.561 --> 14:54.514
and all you can say is that
maybe it's his fault ?

14:54.613 --> 14:56.968
All I'm saying is that
it's a possibility.

14:57.079 --> 14:58.455
You never liked him.

14:58.881 --> 15:00.554
You always assume
the worst in people.

15:00.658 --> 15:03.242
I'm following my instincts,
all right ? It's my job.

15:03.340 --> 15:06.445
That's right, your instincts. That's
why I don't hear from you for a month.

15:06.543 --> 15:08.354
That's why you missed
your niece's birthday.

15:08.358 --> 15:10.183
What are you talking
about right now ?

15:10.287 --> 15:13.070
Look, I'm sorry if I don't have
time for the perfect family

15:13.173 --> 15:15.468
- and the perfect life...
- It's not about being perfect.

15:15.475 --> 15:17.261
It is about being there !

15:18.726 --> 15:20.237
That's why your relationship
with mom

15:20.248 --> 15:22.596
- is so screwed up...
- What ? My relationship...

15:22.722 --> 15:24.070
you keep turning
her against me.

15:24.084 --> 15:25.979
That's what's wrong
with my relationship with ma !

15:25.986 --> 15:28.550
It's never your fault.
You are just like dad.

15:30.174 --> 15:31.925
You wanna play it like that ?

15:32.555 --> 15:36.339
Where'd you get these bruises on your
arm, Jennifer ? Where'd you get those ?

15:36.475 --> 15:38.342
- What ?
- What ? Yeah, I know about'em.

15:38.442 --> 15:40.604
You don't understand.
You don't.

15:55.791 --> 15:56.928
Brett ?

16:04.575 --> 16:05.616
Hopper !

16:27.727 --> 16:30.110
- Randall, how did they find me ?
- I don't know, Brett !

16:30.211 --> 16:32.634
- Did you tell'em ?
- No, I swear to god I didn't tell'em !

16:32.735 --> 16:36.153
They took me, and then they were gonna
get Jen, and they looked at that thing

16:36.255 --> 16:39.310
on  the dash and they knew.
I think it's a G.P.S. or something.

16:41.357 --> 16:43.518
Brett, what the hell
are you doing ?

16:44.347 --> 16:46.279
Where is the package ?
What did you do with it ?

16:46.287 --> 16:47.546
I swear I don't know anything...

16:47.553 --> 16:49.408
- I don't believe you !
- Stop it ! Let him go !

16:49.412 --> 16:52.687
I'm going to count to three,
you hear me ? One... two...

16:52.788 --> 16:55.152
- Brett, please don't...
- I have it !

16:57.611 --> 17:00.426
I hid it, okay ?

17:06.510 --> 17:08.435
I was scared.
I got a call.

17:08.535 --> 17:11.704
They said, "don't tell anyone,"
and I opened it and I saw that.

17:13.378 --> 17:14.919
- Do you know who this woman is ?
- No.

17:15.019 --> 17:17.315
I thought it was some kind
of threat, so I hid it.

17:17.416 --> 17:18.898
I didn't even tell Randall.

17:19.112 --> 17:22.273
Jen, I'm a cop. This is what
I deal with. I can protect you.

17:23.457 --> 17:25.226
- Why didn't you ask me for help ?
- I tried.

17:25.231 --> 17:27.577
- When ?
- Last night. I called you six times.

17:27.648 --> 17:30.042
And I called you back. You said
something was wrong with your phone.

17:30.045 --> 17:32.862
What are you talking about ?
You never called me back.

17:34.744 --> 17:36.082
The cops are coming.

17:36.318 --> 17:37.934
Get the hell off my property.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.793
I'm closing my tabs.
Anything else ?

17:54.894 --> 17:57.087
No, thanks.
Tough shift, huh ?

17:57.198 --> 17:59.195
Just be glad your day's
not as bad as mine.

18:27.070 --> 18:30.777
<i>... in baseball, the Dodgers have
once again defied expectation,</i>

18:30.889 --> 18:33.586
<i>coming back from the dead
with a 7-run rally</i>

18:33.687 --> 18:37.147
<i>in the bottom of the 9th
to beat the Giants 11-10.</i>

18:37.362 --> 18:39.523
I knew it. I told you
this would happen.

18:39.626 --> 18:42.422
But nobody believed me.
Didn't I say this would happen ?

18:42.596 --> 18:44.666
I shoulda put money
on that bitch.

18:49.127 --> 18:51.867
Hey, man, how did
you know they'd win ?

18:56.140 --> 18:58.016
Because the Dodgers rule.

19:00.885 --> 19:02.072
Right. Yeah.

19:02.173 --> 19:03.847
- Go, blue.
- Go, blue.

19:05.135 --> 19:08.083
Yes, this is detective Spivak.
I'm looking into an old case.

19:08.215 --> 19:13.869
The D.R. Number
is 91-1183944641.

19:13.996 --> 19:16.072
Okay, well could you
transfer me then, please ?

19:16.172 --> 19:19.083
So someone checked out the murder book.
I need to know who.

19:19.743 --> 19:23.831
What did you say ?
Internal Affairs pulled a murder book.

19:23.931 --> 19:26.007
I need to know the name
of the requester.

19:26.109 --> 19:30.113
Well then, what time do they open ?
Hello ? Hello ?

19:36.747 --> 19:38.178
- Hello ?
- Hey, it's me.

19:38.377 --> 19:41.075
- Thank god. Are you okay ?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

19:41.174 --> 19:42.620
Brett, you know
what they're saying.

19:42.718 --> 19:45.966
They brought me in, they asked me
questions, told me terrible things.

19:46.066 --> 19:48.085
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry
they put you through all that.

19:48.100 --> 19:50.358
- You know none of it's true.
- I didn't believe it.

19:52.923 --> 19:54.109
I love you.

19:54.812 --> 19:55.910
I love you, too.

19:56.020 --> 19:58.327
Now, I have to ask you a favor.

19:58.716 --> 20:00.494
Honey, I need to speak to Chad.

20:00.739 --> 20:03.344
Now I don't have time to explain.
I know he's there.

20:03.616 --> 20:07.123
That's fine. I just need to speak to
him, because it's very, very important.

20:08.469 --> 20:10.806
It's for you.
It's Brett.

20:17.698 --> 20:20.578
- Hey, partner.
- Internal Affairs pulled a murder book

20:20.592 --> 20:22.957
for a case from 1991.

20:22.961 --> 20:24.444
I need you to tell me who.

20:24.459 --> 20:25.871
<i>Classic Hopper,</i>

20:25.885 --> 20:27.907
target of a citywide manhunt,
but it's still

20:27.909 --> 20:29.814
"I need, I need, I need."

20:29.827 --> 20:31.865
I'm trying to prove
my innocence here.

20:31.881 --> 20:32.622
< i>Great.

20:32.638 --> 20:34.916
Come on into the station,
we'll talk all about it.

20:35.056 --> 20:36.336
Why don't you come get me ?

20:36.348 --> 20:37.908
I'm at the corner of...

20:44.346 --> 20:47.077
Andrea, please tell me that
you did not see Eddie today.

20:47.704 --> 20:48.382
Hello ?

20:49.364 --> 20:51.048
<i>You turned her against me.</i>

20:51.539 --> 20:53.427
- Eddie ?
<i>- You did it, Hopper.</i>

20:53.614 --> 20:55.556
<i>- Remember that.
- Eddie,</i>

20:55.943 --> 20:57.068
<i>what are you doing ?</i>

20:57.083 --> 20:58.374
<i>Put it down !</i>

21:02.610 --> 21:03.510
+

21:19.923 --> 21:21.222
Andrea.

22:07.703 --> 22:09.233
I like when you wake me.

22:09.248 --> 22:12.349
Now you're all dressed, and
I've already missed all the good parts.

22:14.253 --> 22:15.964
That's a good part, too.

22:16.679 --> 22:18.143
Do you remember Eddie Reyes ?

22:18.145 --> 22:19.198
Of course I do.

22:19.315 --> 22:21.114
Are you still feeling bad
about how that went down ?

22:21.129 --> 22:22.909
No, no, it's Andrea.

22:23.250 --> 22:25.767
I feel like she may be getting
caught up in something with him.

22:26.146 --> 22:27.175
Like what ?

22:27.478 --> 22:28.557
I don't know.

22:28.706 --> 22:31.415
It might have to do with
the I.A. Investigations, though.

22:33.299 --> 22:35.172
Whatever it is,
it's not gonna end well.

22:35.247 --> 22:37.150
How could you possibly know that ?

22:37.156 --> 22:39.136
Because I've seen it happen before.

22:39.466 --> 22:41.514
Yeah, but the difference is you.

22:42.123 --> 22:45.023
You've seen this kind of thing happen
before, so why don't you help her ?

22:45.489 --> 22:47.122
Don't let it happen.

22:47.492 --> 22:49.289
It might not be that simple.

22:50.138 --> 22:51.860
Well, then at least you tried.

22:57.764 --> 22:59.610
Be safe today, okay ?

23:01.466 --> 23:02.429
You too.

23:31.082 --> 23:33.955
That thing on the dash.
I think it's a G.P.S. Or something.

23:57.292 --> 23:59.674
- Hopper, what are you doing here ?
- I need to talk to you.

24:00.974 --> 24:03.050
I know this is coming out
of nowhere, but...

24:03.888 --> 24:06.080
you gotta stay away
from Eddie today.

24:06.690 --> 24:08.363
- What ?
- Yeah, he's using again,

24:08.580 --> 24:11.281
so if you see him it'll just...
it'll end bad for the both of you.

24:14.297 --> 24:15.316
Where is he ?

24:17.337 --> 24:18.778
- What are...
- Where is he ?

24:21.096 --> 24:22.108
Hey, Hopper.

24:23.923 --> 24:25.378
You got a lot of cojones,

24:25.390 --> 24:27.266
coming her saying
that crap about me.

24:27.356 --> 24:28.550
You lied to me.

24:28.565 --> 24:31.054
You've been all business
with me for the last six months.

24:31.692 --> 24:34.410
All of a sudden we're best friends,
confiding secrets in each other ?

24:34.427 --> 24:36.052
I never hid anything from you.

24:36.067 --> 24:38.642
Oh, like the fact you've been looking
into the latin disciples ?

24:40.226 --> 24:41.545
Thought I didn't know ?

24:41.666 --> 24:43.626
How is what we do together
any of your business ?

24:43.642 --> 24:45.468
- You stay out of this.
- No, no, no.

24:45.887 --> 24:49.249
You lost the right to tell me what to do when
you called in that drug test to get me fired.

24:49.264 --> 24:51.137
- That's not what happened, Eddie.
- You expect me to believe

24:51.151 --> 24:53.113
- that you didn't even know about it ?
- You weren't doing your job.

24:53.128 --> 24:54.197
That's right.

24:54.211 --> 24:56.249
You just had to protect
your reputation.

24:56.264 --> 24:58.732
And now you're gonna screw
Andrea the way you screwed me.

25:02.294 --> 25:03.701
You're on your own.

25:29.293 --> 25:31.801
<i>- This is Chad Shelton.</i>
- Chad, it's Hopper.

25:31.814 --> 25:33.508
<i>Hopper, didn't expect to hear
from you so early.</i>

25:33.511 --> 25:35.954
- The meeting's at 3 :00.
- Yeah, I actually had a question for you.

25:35.966 --> 25:39.043
I've got some questions for you, too.
I was gonna wait to ask them in person.

25:39.142 --> 25:41.015
So, then, uh, we're still on ?

25:41.021 --> 25:44.199
Oh, I'm sure we're both looking forward
to spending this quality time together.

25:44.216 --> 25:46.608
- So why are you calling me ?
<i>- I'm looking into this...</i>

25:46.640 --> 25:48.451
homicide from 1991.

25:48.455 --> 25:51.325
Now the records say that
Internal Affairs pulled the murder book.

25:51.924 --> 25:53.503
Do you have any idea who ?

25:56.012 --> 25:57.789
I can't wait to help you
out with that, buddy.

25:57.805 --> 25:59.124
Can I get you anything else ?

25:59.243 --> 25:59.871
Maybe

25:59.885 --> 26:01.770
walk your dog for you ?
<i>Wash your car ?</i>

26:02.397 --> 26:03.997
Maybe you wanna
sleep with my ex-wife ?

26:04.155 --> 26:05.519
Oh, wait...

26:07.329 --> 26:08.148
Punk.

26:09.888 --> 26:10.950
Tough day ?

26:10.962 --> 26:11.765
Yeah.

26:12.796 --> 26:14.652
Things'll look up.
What can I bring you ?

26:14.663 --> 26:16.366
Just, uh, some coffee, please.

26:16.575 --> 26:17.307
Okay.

26:23.180 --> 26:25.476
Yes, this is detective Spivak
calling from Homicide.

26:25.492 --> 26:27.260
I'm looking for records.
Yes, I will hold.

26:27.278 --> 26:29.057
Well, I know Internal Affairs has it.

26:29.071 --> 26:31.241
I'm trying to figure out who.
Can I please speak to your lieutenant ?

26:31.258 --> 26:32.797
I need to talk to your captain.

26:32.802 --> 26:34.685
<i>This is the Los Angeles
police department.</i>

26:34.700 --> 26:36.125
<i>Your call is important to us.</i>

26:36.136 --> 26:38.559
<i>Your estimated wait time
is 15 minutes.</i>

26:38.573 --> 26:41.397
Let me ask you something, woman.
This look like white wine to you ?

26:42.689 --> 26:45.521
Oh, now I know you didn't
just do that !

26:45.537 --> 26:47.950
Now bring me what I ordered.

26:55.416 --> 26:56.033
Yeah.

26:56.046 --> 26:57.211
Detective Hopper,

26:57.265 --> 26:59.494
I understand you've been making
some calls.

26:59.605 --> 27:02.000
- Who is this ?
<i>- It's not going to be that easy.</i>

27:05.436 --> 27:08.501
You're going to admit
to killing Alberto Garza.

27:11.239 --> 27:12.559
Well, you're calling me,

27:13.358 --> 27:15.387
who ever you are,
so you must want something.

27:15.793 --> 27:17.172
<i>I'll get right to the point.</i>

27:17.186 --> 27:19.645
<i>You do have something
I'm looking for.</i>

27:20.591 --> 27:21.859
The packages.

27:22.037 --> 27:23.796
<i>Very good, detective Hopper.</i>

27:24.119 --> 27:25.803
Okay, you want the packages.

27:25.853 --> 27:27.181
I want some answers.

27:27.406 --> 27:29.782
<i>You bring what you have
to Elysian park.</i>

27:30.142 --> 27:31.901
<i>There are some picnic tables.</i>

27:31.906 --> 27:34.163
<i>The one on the North end
at 2 :00 p. m...</i>

27:34.292 --> 27:36.496
<i>and I will bring you all
the answers you need.</i>

27:36.509 --> 27:37.760
Okay, if I get there,

27:37.767 --> 27:39.601
and it looks like a trap,
I'm gone.

27:39.627 --> 27:41.165
<i>Detective Hopper,</i>

27:41.450 --> 27:43.668
<i>you act as though
you have a choice.</i>

28:13.806 --> 28:15.460
Andrea, I cannot do tthis
now, okay ?

28:15.474 --> 28:17.236
I tried to help you
early this morning.

28:17.249 --> 28:18.357
You're on your own now.

28:18.373 --> 28:19.555
<i>Please, Hopper.</i>

28:20.644 --> 28:21.453
Andrea ?

28:21.707 --> 28:22.758
I need your help.

28:24.115 --> 28:25.216
It's Eddie.

28:25.978 --> 28:27.477
I made a terrible mistake.

28:27.492 --> 28:28.744
What happened with Eddie ?

28:28.758 --> 28:32.003
I can't go to the police
because of I.A., and Eddie...

28:32.277 --> 28:35.017
look, I need you right now.
And no one else can help me.

28:35.269 --> 28:36.569
If we don't find him,

28:37.015 --> 28:38.381
he's dead.

28:43.009 --> 28:44.030
<i>Please, Hopper.</i>

28:44.035 --> 28:45.757
I can't do this alone.

28:50.335 --> 28:52.787
You bring what you have
to Elysian park...

28:52.809 --> 28:55.157
and I will bring you
all the answers you need.

28:56.640 --> 28:57.540
+

28:59.498 --> 29:02.398
You don't always get to choose who
you fall in love with, though, right ?

29:03.468 --> 29:05.564
I mean, I knew Eddie
had been using,

29:05.606 --> 29:07.136
but I thought that was behind us.

29:09.663 --> 29:12.056
I helped him get clean.
He was better.

29:12.109 --> 29:14.021
I didn't think it was gonna be
like that again.

29:14.304 --> 29:15.364
What happened ?

29:16.213 --> 29:17.235
You did...

29:18.333 --> 29:19.306
this morning.

29:20.828 --> 29:22.740
After you left,
he got so mad.

29:23.722 --> 29:25.914
He started throwing things.
He ran off...

29:27.444 --> 29:29.520
and then he found me here
at the market later.

29:31.682 --> 29:33.154
I've seen him like this before,

29:33.247 --> 29:35.359
and I know he's gonna do
something stupid.

29:35.873 --> 29:37.568
He had his old. 38,

29:37.573 --> 29:39.285
and I know he's gonna score.

29:39.653 --> 29:41.200
Where does he go to score ?

29:41.993 --> 29:43.311
Danny Yan.

29:43.441 --> 29:44.434
Slim ?

29:45.742 --> 29:47.148
Your C.I. ?

29:47.534 --> 29:48.509
Yeah.

29:49.195 --> 29:51.272
What exactly is Eddie mixed up in ?

30:05.979 --> 30:08.716
There's a lot more bounce
than bouncer for club like this.

30:08.866 --> 30:10.260
Something's wrong.

30:10.315 --> 30:12.215
None of Slim's guys are on the floor.

30:15.043 --> 30:17.942
Get everyone out there.
He doesn't leave this neighborhood.

30:22.559 --> 30:23.522
Battle.

30:23.539 --> 30:24.926
I should've known.

30:25.322 --> 30:26.392
Where's Eddie ?

30:26.473 --> 30:28.856
- We had a little disagreement.
- What did you do ?

30:30.127 --> 30:31.465
Tell me something, babe.

30:31.825 --> 30:33.880
How does a pathetic tweaker
like Eddie

30:33.897 --> 30:36.106
score such a sweet slice
of pie like you ?

30:36.110 --> 30:38.668
Yeah, keep talking, slim.
I will shoot your ass.

30:38.671 --> 30:41.083
Hey... I'm a victim here.

30:41.557 --> 30:43.424
I just got assaulted in
my place of business

30:43.429 --> 30:46.129
by your boyfriend, which,
by the way, doubles your juice.

30:46.141 --> 30:47.211
Shut up.

30:50.987 --> 30:53.447
Hopper doesn't know about
our little arrangement, right ?

30:54.523 --> 30:56.516
You want to arrest
somebody, detective,

30:56.529 --> 30:58.568
try our star-crossed lovers here.

30:58.984 --> 31:01.606
One of them's got a nasty habit
he can't keep up with,

31:01.620 --> 31:02.836
and the other one, well...

31:02.840 --> 31:05.223
can you put somebody away
for being an enabler ?

31:05.747 --> 31:06.682
Ah, ah, don't, don't.

31:06.687 --> 31:08.262
See, when Eddie was on the job,

31:08.276 --> 31:10.489
he got used to taking home
free samples,

31:10.501 --> 31:12.857
but ex-cops don't get glass
for free,

31:13.065 --> 31:15.782
so Charlie's angel here
kept bailing him out.

31:16.584 --> 31:18.746
Straight out of Shakespeare, man.

31:18.749 --> 31:20.166
So sad.

31:20.773 --> 31:23.407
Did you wake up this morning and decide
you wanted a bullet in your head ?

31:23.421 --> 31:26.754
Because the day I'm having,
you do not wanna get on my bad side.

31:26.766 --> 31:28.766
- All I'm saying...
- Where's Eddie ?!

31:30.719 --> 31:33.794
Somewhere on foot between
the 110 and the cornfields.

31:33.961 --> 31:35.539
Chinatown ain't that big, man.

31:35.554 --> 31:37.179
You better hope you find
him before we do.

31:37.191 --> 31:38.971
Yeah, you better hope we do, too.

31:46.515 --> 31:48.957
You were paying off that dirtbag ?

31:49.572 --> 31:50.854
That's what I.A.'S got on you ?

31:50.860 --> 31:52.435
- It's not that simple.
- Yeah, it is.

31:52.441 --> 31:54.700
You were giving money
to a drug dealer.

31:54.716 --> 31:56.225
They we gonna kill Eddie, okay ?

31:56.241 --> 31:58.143
I couldn't report it.
I didn't have a choice.

31:58.146 --> 32:00.645
Do you have any idea
what I gave up to help you ?

32:00.890 --> 32:02.306
My family, Rita,

32:02.455 --> 32:05.126
their lives are in danger because
I'm being framed for murder,

32:05.169 --> 32:07.321
and today I had a chance to find
the guy behind it,

32:07.392 --> 32:09.574
maybe even stop it,
but I didn't.

32:10.960 --> 32:12.674
I helped you instead.

32:15.661 --> 32:17.658
- I'm sorry, Hopper.
- "Sorry" ?

32:17.922 --> 32:19.768
"Sorry" doesn't keep me out of jail,

32:19.832 --> 32:21.458
or Rita from getting killed.

32:21.463 --> 32:23.576
"Sorry" doesn't end is damn day.

32:24.647 --> 32:25.649
"Sorry".

32:29.125 --> 32:30.301
Every morning...

32:31.505 --> 32:32.966
I wake up and I think,

32:34.526 --> 32:36.180
maybe today'll be different,

32:37.381 --> 32:39.257
but it always ends the same.

32:40.921 --> 32:43.869
He's 30 days clean,
and I'm back in Slim's parking lot,

32:43.883 --> 32:46.219
hoping to God I find Eddie alive.

32:47.540 --> 32:49.097
But I can't give up,

32:49.111 --> 32:51.083
because what if today
it is different ?

32:51.299 --> 32:53.021
Maybe today he kicks it,

32:53.639 --> 32:54.910
or he dies.

32:56.993 --> 33:00.633
If it were someone you loved, wouldn't you
do everything that you could to save them ?

33:12.646 --> 33:14.328
I know where Eddie's gonna be.

33:17.422 --> 33:19.548
- He's gonna show up near here.
- How do you know that ?

33:19.553 --> 33:21.147
Trust me, just keep looking.

33:21.163 --> 33:23.352
- I'll take the inside, you take the street ?
- Yeah.

33:34.243 --> 33:35.390
- Your keys.
- Eddie.

33:35.405 --> 33:36.980
- Give me your keys.
- Put down the gun.

33:36.997 --> 33:38.591
Now. Now. Shut up.
Shut up.

33:38.597 --> 33:39.513
Hey.

33:39.526 --> 33:41.182
- Keys now.
- Eddie.

33:44.180 --> 33:45.624
- Shut up !
- Hey, Eddie.

33:45.667 --> 33:47.050
This isn't you.

33:48.187 --> 33:50.122
Eddie, don't do this.

33:51.391 --> 33:52.903
Don't do this.

33:54.360 --> 33:55.260
+

33:55.872 --> 33:57.354
You never got it, did you ?

33:57.359 --> 33:59.858
I mean, you just... you didn't even
try to understand.

33:59.864 --> 34:02.650
- Please, Eddie, you don't have to...
- I'm talking here, baby.

34:03.777 --> 34:05.840
All right, what didn't I understand ?

34:05.866 --> 34:08.969
I got seven years on you, and
you still made d-2 before I did.

34:08.983 --> 34:11.085
You know, I mean,
not everybody's a super cop.

34:11.121 --> 34:12.563
I just wanted a little relief.

34:12.569 --> 34:14.436
Okay, okay, I get that.

34:14.746 --> 34:16.545
I get that.
But your beef is with me,

34:16.558 --> 34:18.155
no Andrea, so let her go, man.

34:18.168 --> 34:20.293
- Just put down your gun.
- You know I can't do that.

34:20.301 --> 34:22.646
Eddie, come on,
it doesn't have to go down like this.

34:25.132 --> 34:27.498
You know that... that cholo
that I caught

34:27.723 --> 34:29.867
up in Boyle Heights ?
You know, that low-level dealer ?

34:29.880 --> 34:30.679
What ?

34:31.712 --> 34:33.462
- I patted him down...
- Eddie, stay with me

34:33.475 --> 34:35.056
- Why don't you just listen ?
- All right.

34:35.067 --> 34:36.760
In... booking,

34:36.956 --> 34:39.838
I find out that he's got a little 5-shot
just jammed in his belt,

34:40.775 --> 34:43.081
and he coulda popped us
at any time,

34:44.130 --> 34:46.553
and I didn't catch it'cause
I was tweaking.

34:48.353 --> 34:49.739
So I look at this guy,

34:50.741 --> 34:53.572
and I say, "you know, why...
why didn't you shoot me ?"

34:55.938 --> 34:57.830
And he... he just looks at me

34:57.835 --> 35:00.208
and he said,
"because you seem like a nice guy."

35:01.711 --> 35:03.874
I should be dead,
and you should be dead.

35:03.915 --> 35:06.061
We... all of us should be dead
because of me.

35:07.426 --> 35:09.301
- It's over, man.
- No, it's not over.

35:09.308 --> 35:11.611
Eddie, listen, we can all walk out
of here together.

35:11.629 --> 35:13.830
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey !
- Eddie, no !

35:13.976 --> 35:16.149
I didn't make the call, Eddie.
You hear me ?

35:17.199 --> 35:18.593
I didn't make the call.

35:19.195 --> 35:21.116
All right ?
But I didn't warn you, either.

35:21.995 --> 35:24.117
Now I'd heard that the drug test
was coming down,

35:24.125 --> 35:25.654
and I knew you were using,

35:26.328 --> 35:27.667
but what's on me

35:28.160 --> 35:29.815
is that I coulda helped you,

35:29.828 --> 35:31.109
and I didn't,

35:31.517 --> 35:32.866
and now I'm asking...

35:33.378 --> 35:34.238
all right ?

35:35.058 --> 35:35.913
There.

35:35.947 --> 35:37.336
I'm asking you now,

35:37.635 --> 35:38.561
please,

35:39.946 --> 35:41.524
let me help you now.

35:41.653 --> 35:42.706
- No.
- Eddie ?

35:44.262 --> 35:46.463
Let me help you.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.868
Let me help you this time.

35:51.266 --> 35:52.163
Okay.

35:54.977 --> 35:56.141
I got you.

35:56.963 --> 35:58.423
- Okay.
- Sorry.

35:58.687 --> 35:59.659
All right.

36:01.075 --> 36:01.980
all right.

36:03.645 --> 36:05.979
I'm so sorry.

36:45.279 --> 36:47.509
- Morning.
- Hey, good morning.

36:47.818 --> 36:49.587
I didn't hear you get up.

36:49.738 --> 36:52.283
- I didn't want to wake you.
- I like when you wake me.

36:54.668 --> 36:56.225
Is everything okay ?

36:56.776 --> 36:58.343
The phone is ringing.

36:59.088 --> 37:00.868
Yeah, that's that's what it does.

37:00.883 --> 37:03.821
- This hasn't happened before.
- What, someone calling you ?

37:03.835 --> 37:05.967
- Are you kidding ?
- No, it's not that.

37:07.001 --> 37:08.512
Something's changed.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.430
- Andrea.
- Hey, Hopper.

37:11.286 --> 37:12.345
So...

37:13.761 --> 37:15.964
this might sound a little
out of the blue, but...

37:17.529 --> 37:19.512
I'm taking Eddie
to rehab this morning.

37:19.709 --> 37:21.591
<i>There's a lot to tell you.</i>

37:24.178 --> 37:25.399
You still there ?

37:27.926 --> 37:30.079
You didn't have to come.
I can do this without you.

37:30.083 --> 37:32.219
Yeah, well, I just wanted
to see for myself.

37:32.231 --> 37:34.240
You know, you threw a lot at me
on the phone.

37:35.533 --> 37:37.579
Sorry. It's just...

37:37.891 --> 37:39.669
when I woke up today, I felt...

37:40.900 --> 37:42.048
I felt different.

37:42.407 --> 37:43.619
Different ?
Like... like how ?

37:43.634 --> 37:46.624
Like I had this weird urge
to call you, and then

37:46.665 --> 37:48.552
all this stuff came out, and...

37:49.976 --> 37:52.069
it's strange.
I've been feeling so

37:52.853 --> 37:54.947
hopeless, but today,
I don't know.

37:55.239 --> 37:57.145
So it... it's good ?

37:57.609 --> 37:58.437
Yeah,

37:59.364 --> 38:01.486
and even with
this I.A. Stuff, I mean,

38:01.865 --> 38:04.709
I woke up with the strangest idea.
Why don't I just tell Chad the truth ?

38:04.726 --> 38:07.413
I'd like to think that, uh, you know,
he wouldn't crucify you, but...

38:07.419 --> 38:10.754
Yeah, I've already called my league rep
and told him that's what I'm gonna do, so...

38:11.475 --> 38:13.714
If I get days, I get days.

38:13.999 --> 38:14.961
And...

38:15.553 --> 38:17.197
if I loose my job...

38:18.219 --> 38:19.526
at least I'm not dead.

38:22.881 --> 38:25.186
What ? Why... why does that
make you laugh ?

38:25.218 --> 38:27.246
No, it's... this just isn't
the day

38:27.261 --> 38:28.647
that I expected to have.

38:28.662 --> 38:30.124
Yeah, me neither...

38:32.104 --> 38:33.595
but here we are.

38:35.097 --> 38:36.195
What about Eddie ?

38:37.063 --> 38:39.762
Well, I don't think he's happy
to be pushed out of the nest.

38:40.362 --> 38:42.083
I don't think it's gonna
be easy either way.

38:45.963 --> 38:47.156
What are you looking at ?

38:47.400 --> 38:49.400
- My old partner.
- Don't look so smug.

38:49.406 --> 38:51.310
I'll break my foot off
in your ass, cabron.

38:51.566 --> 38:53.814
So you got any gas in
this piece of crap, or what ?

39:12.883 --> 39:14.844
What, is this this some kind of joke ?

39:16.069 --> 39:17.551
What are you talking about ?

39:17.554 --> 39:20.370
Like I'm supposed to see this,
and it'll remind me of

39:20.375 --> 39:23.246
what kind of cop I used to be
or some garbage like that ?

39:23.816 --> 39:25.604
What's supposed to remind you of that ?

39:25.619 --> 39:27.620
This stupid picture that you dug up.

39:27.623 --> 39:29.527
- You knew about that picture ?
- Yeah, I should.

39:29.541 --> 39:31.761
- I was the first officer on scene.
- What ?

39:31.776 --> 39:34.965
Jane Doe. Body dumped in a car
off Figueroa.

39:34.979 --> 39:36.978
I was a rookie.
I didn't know much.

39:37.166 --> 39:38.801
That's when I first met your old man.

39:39.853 --> 39:40.891
He was okay.

39:41.532 --> 39:42.524
My father was there ?

39:42.577 --> 39:44.047
Yeah, he was the lead detective
on it.

39:44.101 --> 39:44.986
But he didn't close it.

39:45.049 --> 39:47.366
Evidence went missing,
and it just all fell apart.

39:48.617 --> 39:52.305
It's funny how they always hinge
on some little, stupid thing.

39:52.433 --> 39:55.604
