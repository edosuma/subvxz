00:02.252 --> 00:03.754
Why the fuck do you think
you're so special?

00:03.754 --> 00:05.964
Edwin hooks up with another
girl every set of vacationers.

00:05.964 --> 00:08.634
That's not true.
Have you asked him?

00:08.634 --> 00:10.886
You have a problem.
I can take care of it.

00:10.886 --> 00:13.430
If I do this, you can never
be with Gogo.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.224
I don't understand you at all.

00:15.224 --> 00:16.892
No matter what I do,
it's not good enough.

00:16.892 --> 00:19.186
It's like you always looking
for a reason to be mad at me,

00:19.186 --> 00:20.562
when all I want is...
- You right.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.981
<i>I hear you and Edwin
the other night.</i>

00:22.981 --> 00:24.775
You said he have
feelings for you.

00:24.775 --> 00:26.068
I need to know if it true.

00:26.068 --> 00:27.444
It is not your business.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.071
I stopped going
to Dr. Norton.

00:29.071 --> 00:30.072
Wasn't she helping?

00:30.072 --> 00:31.490
I don't need to go to therapy

00:31.490 --> 00:32.908
to fix what's wrong with me.

00:32.908 --> 00:37.538
I need to fucking know
what happened to my sister.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.872
Don't walk away from me.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.083
Where the fuck is my money?
- I didn't take it.

00:41.083 --> 00:43.752
Once a criminal,
always a criminal.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.921
What do we have here?

00:45.921 --> 00:47.464
Go!

01:10.737 --> 01:12.322
Hello?

01:12.322 --> 01:13.740
<i>Farhad is in the hospital.</i>

01:13.740 --> 01:15.284
<i>He told the police
he was mugged.</i>

01:15.284 --> 01:16.618
<i>I thought you should know.</i>

01:31.133 --> 01:33.677
No. Please stop.

01:33.677 --> 01:36.096
<i>No. Stop. No.
Get away from me.</i>

01:36.096 --> 01:38.849
Em?

01:38.849 --> 01:40.934
What is it? What...

01:40.934 --> 01:43.145
Hey, hey.
It's okay.

01:43.145 --> 01:45.772
It's okay. You're okay.
It's just a dream.

01:45.772 --> 01:46.815
It's just a dream.
That's all.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.525
Jesus.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.068
- It's fine. I'm fine.
- You're shaking.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.069
I'm fine.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.782
I just need a minute.
I just need a minute.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.829
I'm fine.

02:00.829 --> 02:04.374
Baby, you've been lying here
for two days.

02:04.374 --> 02:07.544
That is not fine.

02:07.544 --> 02:10.130
Please tell me what happened
the other night.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.508
And when I found you,
you were practically catatonic.

02:13.508 --> 02:16.303
I know this has to do
with Clive.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.139
Did he hurt you?
Did something happen?

02:21.850 --> 02:23.810
Please tell me,

02:23.810 --> 02:26.271
because I am so scared
right now, Emily.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.441
I've--I've never seen you
like this,

02:29.441 --> 02:30.609
and I don't know what to do.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.069
I mean, if you don't want
to talk to me,

02:32.069 --> 02:33.654
okay, but you gotta
call someone.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.656
You gotta call Dr. Norton
or you call your parents.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.656
Okay?

02:39.951 --> 02:42.662
Okay, Em? Please?
Do you hear me?

02:52.839 --> 02:55.634
Okay, I'll call
Dr. Norton today.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.806
I'm so sorry.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.728
There is something
really wrong with me, Josh.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.356
Yeah.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.024
There's...

03:11.024 --> 03:13.610
there's something
really wrong with me.

03:28.959 --> 03:32.295
Bless me, Father,

03:32.295 --> 03:36.133
for I have si...

03:36.133 --> 03:38.718
I have sinned.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.595
What is it, my son?

03:48.603 --> 03:50.480
I lost my temper.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.025
Again.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.717
Me don't think
this is a good idea.

04:18.717 --> 04:20.552
What you talking about, Gogo?

04:20.552 --> 04:23.054
We gonna see the waterfall.
But me gran say

04:23.054 --> 04:24.848
me auntie came to Faraway
with she friends,

04:24.848 --> 04:26.808
and she was never seen again.

04:26.808 --> 04:30.604
Who don't have a naughty
auntie who disappear here?

04:33.356 --> 04:34.774
It's the goat witch.

04:34.774 --> 04:35.984
She gonna get we.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.824
It's just the wind.
Stop being such babies.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.454
I'll go check it out.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.748
No, Edwin. Stick together.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.812
Oh, no please.
No, no, no please.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.157
What is it?
What is wrong?

05:24.157 --> 05:26.868
It is the goat witch.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.912
She coming for me
because I'm a sinner.

05:28.912 --> 05:32.332
Stop, stop, stop.
Stop, Edwin. Stop.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.042
You okay.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.586
You okay.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.797
You okay. You okay.

05:42.384 --> 05:44.261
I just kidding.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.179
I'm not scared.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.056
I just messing with you.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.016
You make it too easy.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.740
Good morning, Stephen.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.784
How we doing on this fine day?

06:07.784 --> 06:10.078
Ah, I see we be
as eloquent as ever.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.289
Get to work.
- Will do, sir.

06:12.289 --> 06:13.915
Pleasure chatting, as always.

06:21.298 --> 06:24.926
Goges, big man,
how are we today?

06:24.926 --> 06:27.429
How you think?

06:27.429 --> 06:29.639
You know, I covered for you
last night when you just left.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.558
And then you get
the late shift today.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.018
Yeah, I had to catch a ride
with Des again,

06:33.018 --> 06:34.769
and he fed up with you too.

06:34.769 --> 06:37.314
Yeah, well, I'm sorry
you miss me, big man.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.940
There's still no replacement
for Julian,

06:38.940 --> 06:41.484
and we all working our asses
off while you off having fun.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.737
I apologize, okay?
I do.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.157
Something else troubling you?

06:49.618 --> 06:53.038
Sara coming to do braids
later today.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.081
I already dropped two plates
of chicken tenders

06:55.081 --> 06:57.292
and a mimosa, and Stephen said
it coming out of me salary.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.918
Let me take care of him.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.420
I want you not to worry,
all right?

07:00.420 --> 07:01.921
And I take them drinks
for you too.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.758
Go, relax.
Have a break.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.217
They for the anti-men.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.114
Good sirs,

07:28.114 --> 07:29.866
great to see you.
Great to see you

07:29.866 --> 07:31.201
enjoying our ocean and breeze.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.411
Now, would you be interested
in an excursion perhaps?

07:33.411 --> 07:35.163
We have snorkeling.
We have zip-lining.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.206
Edwin.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.500
There you boys are.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.461
You abandoned me last night.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.755
Where were you?
I looked everywhere.

07:43.755 --> 07:46.341
Mrs. Jamie, great to see you.

07:46.341 --> 07:48.635
Would you like
a banana daiquiri perhaps?

07:48.635 --> 07:51.012
You know me so well, Edwin.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.223
Now, dish.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.100
You weren't trying
to blow me off, were you?

07:55.100 --> 07:56.184
No, no.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.103
We, uh--we just went
off-resort.

07:58.103 --> 08:01.064
Yeah, uh, it was interesting actually.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.149
There's this forest back there.
Mm-hmm.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.031
I can't believe today's
your last day here.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.784
I'm gonna be so fucking bored
without you.

08:12.784 --> 08:15.620
Who am I gonna talk to?
Fucking Pookah Shell?

08:15.620 --> 08:18.498
Wes isn't that bad.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.333
At least you're not another

08:20.333 --> 08:21.793
piece in his collection.

08:21.793 --> 08:24.671
You're still hung up on that?

08:24.671 --> 08:27.298
I just can't leave here being

08:27.298 --> 08:29.217
"the blonde one from
the land Westchester."

08:29.217 --> 08:33.221
Listen, I get wanting
to be memorable, okay, Alison?

08:33.221 --> 08:35.223
Hell, I just want people
to remember my name, so...

08:38.226 --> 08:40.603
I just need to figure out
how to show him

08:40.603 --> 08:44.190
that I'm not
some stupid tourist.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.860
Okay, so what are you
planning to do?

08:46.860 --> 08:49.696
Maybe I...

08:49.696 --> 08:52.532
do something with him
that he's never done

08:52.532 --> 08:55.410
with another white girl.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.328
- Butt sex?
- No!

08:57.328 --> 08:58.329
Not! Not!

08:58.329 --> 08:59.330
What do you mean?

08:59.330 --> 09:00.540
Why not?

09:00.540 --> 09:01.541
Ew.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.492
So Edwin really
didn't make

09:35.492 --> 09:37.243
Sara's mom's boyfriend disappear.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.162
Bery, no.
He didn't kill he.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.539
He got the man a job
on he uncle fishing boat,

09:41.539 --> 09:44.167
and in exchange for the favor,

09:44.167 --> 09:47.170
he told Sara that
she can never be with Gogo.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.464
- But they were kids.
- But he keep on reminding her

09:49.464 --> 09:52.675
this promise for all she life.
After she was pregnant even.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.552
Don't make no sense, Desmond.

09:54.552 --> 09:57.722
I know, but there's
just one way to explain it.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.849
Edwin be in love with Sara

09:59.849 --> 10:02.811
all these years.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.729
So do I tell Goges?

10:04.729 --> 10:07.482
Or do I spare he the pain?

10:08.858 --> 10:10.693
Have a great day, okay?

10:16.783 --> 10:19.786
If I were you,
I'd keep my mouth shut.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.788
Gogo knowing this
would cause an earthquake

10:21.788 --> 10:24.249
that none of we
would ever recover from.

10:33.007 --> 10:36.094
I didn't know how to stop.

10:36.094 --> 10:39.222
He was all I could think about.

10:39.222 --> 10:43.393
Oh, Emily.

10:43.393 --> 10:46.062
I wish you'd come to me sooner.

10:48.273 --> 10:53.236
Seeing Clive
attack that man...

10:53.236 --> 10:58.616
what he was capable of...

10:58.616 --> 11:02.120
what he did to my--my sister...

11:02.120 --> 11:06.291
You put yourself
in grave danger.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.877
You know what
the most fucked-up part is?

11:13.840 --> 11:15.842
Despite all of it...

11:21.973 --> 11:25.310
There's a piece of me that
still wants to see him again.

11:28.938 --> 11:32.358
Emily...

11:32.358 --> 11:34.861
do you know what
survivor's guilt is?

11:37.488 --> 11:40.241
Of course, but I mean, what
does that have to do with me?

11:40.241 --> 11:42.243
Do you think it's possible,

11:42.243 --> 11:46.915
part of you is trying to meet
the same fate as your sister?

11:46.915 --> 11:48.833
No, of course not.

11:50.877 --> 11:54.923
I wouldn't...

11:54.923 --> 11:57.550
no.
I just want answers.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.135
Would you really
want to put your parents

11:59.135 --> 12:02.138
through the experience
of losing another child?

12:02.138 --> 12:04.265
Because, Emily,

12:04.265 --> 12:07.644
at some point,
you have to accept reality.

12:07.644 --> 12:10.355
No answers are coming.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.607
Alison is gone.

12:12.607 --> 12:16.110
She's never coming back.

12:16.110 --> 12:19.238
Is it really worth your safety
and wellbeing

12:19.238 --> 12:22.325
to learn how it happened?

12:22.325 --> 12:25.370
What matters--
- No, what matters is,

12:25.370 --> 12:28.539
my sister

12:28.539 --> 12:31.751
was raped and murdered,

12:31.751 --> 12:34.504
and left to die

12:34.504 --> 12:36.589
on a remote island

12:36.589 --> 12:38.633
surrounded by nothing

12:38.633 --> 12:40.718
but fucking goats.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.767
That is the only thing

12:47.767 --> 12:49.394
that matters.

12:51.562 --> 12:54.107
How does no one see this?

12:54.107 --> 12:58.861
How can no one see that?
How can no one understand that?

12:58.861 --> 13:01.531
I need to know
why they did this.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.992
If I can't understand
what would drive two men,

13:03.992 --> 13:07.578
one who was kind to me,
who was my friend,

13:07.578 --> 13:09.831
to do that kind of thing,

13:09.831 --> 13:13.209
how can I possibly understand
how to live in this world?

13:13.209 --> 13:15.003
- Okay, Emily.
- No. No.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.754
Let's just...
- No.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.519
Look where you're going!

13:38.026 --> 13:39.986
Watch out!

13:39.986 --> 13:42.864
What the fuck? Come on!

13:42.864 --> 13:44.282
Get out of the way!

13:44.282 --> 13:46.576
Come on. Move.

14:14.437 --> 14:16.147
Please don't look at me
like that.

14:16.147 --> 14:18.941
How am I supposed
to look at you?

14:18.941 --> 14:22.320
I just watched you
walk into traffic,

14:22.320 --> 14:25.782
just like the story you told me
about your breakdown.

14:25.782 --> 14:29.535
It wasn't like that.

14:29.535 --> 14:32.747
I was distracted.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.540
I have a lot on my mind.

14:36.459 --> 14:37.460
And I'm just...

14:42.840 --> 14:47.887
I'm really fucked up.

14:47.887 --> 14:52.767
Like, way more fucked up
than you'd guess.

14:52.767 --> 14:56.062
You know,

14:56.062 --> 14:57.814
I have me issues too.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.201
Did something happen?

15:14.163 --> 15:16.874
You have secrets.
- What?

15:16.874 --> 15:20.044
I just meant, you have
your secrets, I have mine.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.800
That's why I can trust you.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.218
You know what it's like.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.352
You still got those cards?

16:01.586 --> 16:03.629
What kind of silliness
is this?

16:03.629 --> 16:05.840
I should tell Mom,
but she couldn't handle it.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.383
I'm not doing anything.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.302
But you thinking,
and it's sin just as bad.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.387
The goat woman gonna get you
for true.

16:11.387 --> 16:13.472
Leave me alone.
That's right.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.267
Go find you chubby little
boyfriend to comfort you.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.043
You stand out.
Not just ordinary, special.

17:16.244 --> 17:18.454
- Hi.
- Sorry, me break over, miss.

17:18.454 --> 17:22.166
Well, just--did you know
that tonight was my last night?

17:22.166 --> 17:24.460
Westchester
needs she queen back.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.420
I was hoping
we could do something special,

17:26.420 --> 17:28.297
like maybe off the resort.

17:28.297 --> 17:29.924
What?
You want to meet my mom?

17:29.924 --> 17:31.884
And I don't think so, miss.
- No.

17:31.884 --> 17:35.263
Um... Faraway Cay?

17:35.263 --> 17:37.181
Why? None on the island
but goats, ma'am.

17:37.181 --> 17:40.268
And the goat witch.

17:40.268 --> 17:43.521
That goat witch--that
goat witch is stupid nonsense.

17:43.521 --> 17:46.607
You hear me?
Nothing but island fuckery.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.128
I told some of the guests
you was coming

18:07.128 --> 18:09.922
to do braids later, so...

18:09.922 --> 18:11.882
hopefully you'll get
a lot of customers today.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.884
Thank you, Clive. Mm.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.636
You know, waking your son up
this morning

18:15.636 --> 18:17.388
was like poking
a sleeping bear.

18:17.388 --> 18:19.724
Oh, yeah?
Rough morning for Clive.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.350
God, he be grumpy.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.394
You should've seen he.
The look on he face.

18:23.394 --> 18:24.562
He look just like you

18:24.562 --> 18:27.231
when you're angry.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.400
Yes, that is the one.

18:29.400 --> 18:32.570
Well, he gonna be grumpy
like me, but smart like he mom.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.490
It gonna be okay.

18:38.993 --> 18:40.244
You want me
to watch he tonight?

18:40.244 --> 18:42.747
Um, maybe tomorrow night
if you don't mind.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.210
You seeing Keithley?

18:49.420 --> 18:50.421
Yes.

18:52.757 --> 18:55.009
It's okay.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.177
You have fun.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.513
Thank you.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.192
You okay?

19:11.192 --> 19:13.694
You're very quiet.

19:13.694 --> 19:17.990
Yeah, I'm just thinking.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.910
I feel like I've been
really distracted

19:20.910 --> 19:23.412
with stupid boys this trip

19:23.412 --> 19:25.414
and not giving you
the time you deserve,

19:25.414 --> 19:29.293
and I'm sorry.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.337
It's okay.
I understand.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.589
You were being vacation Alison,

19:33.589 --> 19:36.050
and I was still
Westchester Clairey.

19:39.053 --> 19:40.304
You know, I miss you
all the time

19:40.304 --> 19:41.847
when I'm at school.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.600
- Really?
- All the time.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.060
Me too.

19:46.060 --> 19:50.856
Sometimes I go in your room
and look at all your stuff.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.441
Clairey!

19:52.441 --> 19:56.654
Don't touch my stuff.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.656
I have an idea.

19:58.656 --> 20:01.283
What if tonight,
after the party,

20:01.283 --> 20:05.496
we get a ton of candy, everything,

20:05.496 --> 20:07.081
everything,

20:07.081 --> 20:11.669
and watch TV and stay up
way past our bedtime?

20:11.669 --> 20:13.337
Really?

20:13.337 --> 20:15.423
- That sounds great.
- Okay.

20:15.423 --> 20:17.299
What should we get?
- Uh...

20:17.299 --> 20:19.343
- Tootsie Rolls.
- Sour Patch.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.220
- Yeah, we can get Sour Patch.
- Bubble gum.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.473
Hello, hello.

20:24.473 --> 20:27.143
I have a customer for you.

20:27.143 --> 20:30.396
You ready to look
like an island girl?

20:30.396 --> 20:31.981
Come sit down.

20:34.692 --> 20:37.361
You can keep the change.

20:37.361 --> 20:41.907
How long will this take?
- No more than two hours, miss.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.952
You sit tight and be patient
while she works, okay?

20:44.952 --> 20:46.203
I'll be back soon.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.497
I'm gonna take a swim
and clear my head, okay?

20:51.459 --> 20:52.668
Thank you so much.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.796
That's okay, miss.

20:55.796 --> 21:00.301
Ooh, you are very brave girl.

21:00.301 --> 21:04.138
And your sister is
very beautiful.

21:04.138 --> 21:07.224
My sister is perfect.

21:07.224 --> 21:08.601
Oh.

21:22.323 --> 21:26.076
Thinking about Sara?

21:26.076 --> 21:28.329
You truly love she, don't you?

21:36.212 --> 21:40.299
Ever since my mom died,

21:40.299 --> 21:44.136
all I ever wanted was a family.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.847
And here I am,

21:46.847 --> 21:51.060
a father with a son, but...

21:51.060 --> 21:55.856
Sara won't let us be one,

21:55.856 --> 21:58.943
and I will never
understand why.

22:21.966 --> 22:24.218
Seriously?

22:24.218 --> 22:26.887
Hey, I don't want
to bother you.

22:26.887 --> 22:30.307
I just...

22:30.307 --> 22:31.976
my behavior was appalling

22:31.976 --> 22:35.521
and inexcusable and it was...
- It sucked.

22:35.521 --> 22:38.274
I know.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.401
And I know you're leaving tomorrow,

22:40.401 --> 22:41.485
and I can't stand the thought

22:41.485 --> 22:43.404
of that being
how you remember me.

22:43.404 --> 22:45.489
If it's any consolation,

22:45.489 --> 22:48.450
I hate myself
more than you ever could.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.744
I don't hate you, Tyler.

22:50.744 --> 22:54.623
- You don't?
- No. I...

22:54.623 --> 22:57.835
I think you have
some growing up to do,

22:57.835 --> 23:01.463
but you're a good guy.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.841
You got a good heart.

23:03.841 --> 23:06.719
Any chance you wanna hang out
tonight after the party?

23:06.719 --> 23:08.470
Not like...

23:08.470 --> 23:10.639
As friends.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.808
I've really perfected
my bocce ball game.

23:12.808 --> 23:15.144
Um...

23:15.144 --> 23:20.482
I actually have a hot date
with Claire, but thanks.

23:20.482 --> 23:23.986
Okay.

23:23.986 --> 23:25.487
I'll see you later then.

23:38.876 --> 23:41.670
You're really going
after those sixes, huh?

23:41.670 --> 23:42.713
Maybe.

23:52.598 --> 23:55.309
There's something
I've wanted to tell you.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.985
When I was seven,
my brother was murdered.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.993
The man who did it
was never convicted.

24:14.453 --> 24:17.289
He walked free

24:17.289 --> 24:21.085
like nothing ever happened,

24:21.085 --> 24:23.128
and my life was ripped apart.

24:28.676 --> 24:32.972
Do you know what that's like?

24:32.972 --> 24:36.725
I know the feeling of being

24:36.725 --> 24:38.268
ripped apart.

24:41.230 --> 24:45.234
Do you ever wonder

24:45.234 --> 24:47.361
what you would do
if you could look the person

24:47.361 --> 24:49.405
who ruined your life
in the eye?

25:01.417 --> 25:05.838
I think we need
something stronger.

25:05.838 --> 25:06.964
What do you say?

25:41.206 --> 25:44.293
There. Right next to Orion.

25:44.293 --> 25:46.462
That is Sirius,

25:46.462 --> 25:47.921
Orion's trusted dog

25:47.921 --> 25:49.923
and brightest star
in the whole sky.

25:49.923 --> 25:52.301
Wow.

25:52.301 --> 25:54.428
Sirius never leave Orion.

25:54.428 --> 25:58.766
He follow he master
across all of space.

25:58.766 --> 25:59.767
Like we.

26:02.186 --> 26:06.523
Oh, look! A shooting star.

26:06.523 --> 26:09.068
Make a wish.

26:09.068 --> 26:12.488
I wish I could be here
with Sara.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.156
If only she would come
to she senses

26:14.156 --> 26:16.325
and break up
with stupid Keithley.

26:19.203 --> 26:21.455
You truly like she, huh?

26:21.455 --> 26:23.916
She perfect in every way.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.835
Except that you don't like she.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.504
How come?

26:33.383 --> 26:35.511
Goges, I--

26:35.511 --> 26:37.971
Hey, hey!
We found they.

26:37.971 --> 26:39.223
We found they.

26:39.223 --> 26:41.225
Desmond found
a couple of anti-men

26:41.225 --> 26:42.601
doing the nasty down the way.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.019
We gonna use they
for target practice. Come on.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.395
Grab as many rocks
as you can.

26:45.395 --> 26:47.314
We gonna teach those sinners
a lesson.

27:01.703 --> 27:03.038
Is it just me, Goges,

27:03.038 --> 27:04.832
or you feel like everybody
acting so nutty today?

27:04.832 --> 27:06.667
Hmm.
You know it's true.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.710
I think there is something up
with Mercury.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.879
What? What, you into
astrology now, Goges?

27:10.879 --> 27:12.256
Well, you surprise me
every day.

27:12.256 --> 27:13.882
No, no, no.
That hyper-fit woman,

27:13.882 --> 27:15.425
she read me star chart
this morning,

27:15.425 --> 27:17.261
and there is something up
with Mercury.

27:17.261 --> 27:19.888
Oh, man, these whities.
They a laugh now.

27:21.557 --> 27:23.684
Hey, so it turns out

27:23.684 --> 27:26.311
I don't have to mind Clive
till tomorrow.

27:26.311 --> 27:29.022
So should we go liming
at Paulette's tonight?

27:29.022 --> 27:31.149
Yes, yes. Paulette's.
You and me.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.192
Yes.
- Let's do it, man.

27:32.192 --> 27:34.027
Yo, Des.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.612
Me, Edwin going
to Paulette's tonight.

27:35.612 --> 27:38.031
You coming?
With he? No thanks.

27:38.031 --> 27:41.577
I got a reputation to uphold.

27:41.577 --> 27:46.456
Since when he challenge
you reputation?

27:46.456 --> 27:47.958
Looks like Mercury
got to he too.

27:47.958 --> 27:48.959
Hmm.
- Yeah.

28:09.146 --> 28:10.647
Okay, Thomases,

28:10.647 --> 28:12.608
let's--let's each say one thing
we learned on vacation.

28:12.608 --> 28:14.443
I've learned that my dad
is super corny.

28:14.443 --> 28:16.403
Oh, thank you.

28:16.403 --> 28:20.782
Hilarious, firstborn.
All right, um, I'll go first.

28:20.782 --> 28:24.411
I learned that
I need to chill sometimes.

28:24.411 --> 28:26.455
More sleep, more exercise.
Less work.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.790
I think that is lovely, Bill.

28:28.790 --> 28:30.834
I'm just wondering
if that attitude

28:30.834 --> 28:33.545
will make it until... Wednesday?

28:34.630 --> 28:37.132
Oh, a family of comedians,
are we?

28:37.132 --> 28:38.342
Okay, you go, wise-ass.

28:38.342 --> 28:41.720
I guess I learned how

28:41.720 --> 28:45.724
restorative it is

28:45.724 --> 28:48.769
just to be together,
the four of us.

28:48.769 --> 28:50.812
Mom, Princeton is
two hours away.

28:50.812 --> 28:53.899
I literally see you
all the time,

28:53.899 --> 28:58.695
but I am also grateful
for family time.

28:58.695 --> 29:02.407
And I know I talk a big game,

29:02.407 --> 29:07.371
but I realized I still have
a lot to experience,

29:07.371 --> 29:09.081
and I intend to.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.874
- To be 19 again.
- Yeah.

29:10.874 --> 29:13.043
I want that for you, too, honey.

29:13.043 --> 29:16.672
I want you
to experience it all.

29:16.672 --> 29:17.881
Before you know it,
you're gonna find yourself

29:17.881 --> 29:20.342
with a mortgage
and a baby on the way.

29:20.342 --> 29:24.221
Oh, I don't plan to make
the same choices you guys did.

29:24.221 --> 29:26.473
Nobody's saying that.

29:26.473 --> 29:27.975
Just saying.

29:27.975 --> 29:29.476
All right,
what about you, Clairey?

29:29.476 --> 29:30.560
What'd you learn, honey?

29:30.560 --> 29:32.562
I learned it takes
a long time

29:32.562 --> 29:34.773
to look like an island girl.

29:36.358 --> 29:38.527
Clairey.
Conga!

29:38.527 --> 29:39.569
Oh, let's go.

33:01.188 --> 33:03.690
You, me, Gogo.

33:03.690 --> 33:08.486
We can smoke, we can drink,
we can dance the night away.

33:08.486 --> 33:11.531
I can do all that stuff here.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.950
Paulette's is
a real local spot.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.744
Hmm? You will love it.

33:15.744 --> 33:18.038
No tourists go there.

33:18.038 --> 33:22.000
Then afterward,
maybe we can go to Faraway.

33:24.002 --> 33:27.255
- Maybe.
- Mm-hmm.

33:27.255 --> 33:30.258
I'll be in the roundabout,
waiting for you after my shift.

33:30.258 --> 33:32.344
Don't disappoint me now.

33:50.946 --> 33:52.447
I wouldn't have made it
two steps

33:52.447 --> 33:53.740
without dumping that
on someone.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.450
Where'd you get skills
like that?

33:55.450 --> 33:57.911
I worked at a resort
on the island.

34:03.667 --> 34:05.877
I was too clumsy
for service work.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.296
I was better suited for retail.

34:08.296 --> 34:10.131
In high school,
I worked at the Hot Topic

34:10.131 --> 34:13.843
at the local mall.
I hated it.

34:18.431 --> 34:20.100
Do you like working
at the resort?

34:20.100 --> 34:22.227
I did,

34:22.227 --> 34:26.856
but most people were rich,
barely noticed me.

34:26.856 --> 34:29.985
But it was nice working
on the beach with my friends.

34:33.488 --> 34:35.490
You never said why you left.

34:37.701 --> 34:39.869
There was an incident.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.834
Hey, to regrets.

34:53.258 --> 34:55.760

36:46.371 --> 36:48.456

I'll see you next week.

36:50.625 --> 36:51.835
You a fucking liar, Des!

36:51.835 --> 36:53.378
No, me not.

36:53.378 --> 36:55.964

Olivia, I need
to talk to you.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.022
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, of course. What's up?

37:13.022 --> 37:15.734
So Edwin invited me
to a local bar tonight

37:15.734 --> 37:16.901
and then to Faraway.

37:16.901 --> 37:19.446
Okay, sounds
like a memorable night.

37:19.446 --> 37:22.699
I know, and I really
wanna go, but I...

37:22.699 --> 37:23.950
does that make me
look desperate

37:23.950 --> 37:25.493
because he was
such a dick to me earlier?

37:25.493 --> 37:27.412
Alison, this is your
last night here, all right?

37:27.412 --> 37:30.081
Just like, have fun.
Have an adventure.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.041
I mean, look,
it's a great story

37:32.041 --> 37:35.670
to take back
to Princeton with you.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.505
Okay.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.132
Yeah.

37:39.132 --> 37:42.802
I can't believe you're, like,
gonna do the deed with Edwin.

37:42.802 --> 37:45.805
You think?
I don't know.

37:45.805 --> 37:49.893
Gogo's coming, which is
kind of weird, I feel like.

37:49.893 --> 37:54.606
You want to be the girl that
Edwin doesn't forget, right?

37:54.606 --> 37:59.110
What if you have a threesome
with his best friend?

38:04.073 --> 38:06.284
How would I even,
like, initiate?

38:06.284 --> 38:07.494
Okay, if you were a guy,

38:07.494 --> 38:09.162
you wouldn't think
twice about this, right?

38:09.162 --> 38:10.580
Okay, you're young, you're hot.

38:10.580 --> 38:13.166
This is, like, your chance
to live your biggest life.

38:13.166 --> 38:14.834
Just go, okay?

38:17.086 --> 38:18.838
- Yes.
- You're gonna do it?

38:18.838 --> 38:21.841
You're gonna do it.

38:25.637 --> 38:28.389
Hey, hey, Edwin,
you--you okay, man?

38:28.389 --> 38:30.600
Man, fuck you!

38:30.600 --> 38:32.101
You ruined my life.

38:32.101 --> 38:35.313
What?
W--what do you mean?

38:35.313 --> 38:38.024
This is not San Francisco.

38:38.024 --> 38:41.486
On this island,
people like you--

38:41.486 --> 38:43.905
man, you're worse than trash.

38:43.905 --> 38:47.242
Now that you fucking told
everybody what you saw,

38:47.242 --> 38:50.411
I'm never gonna be able
to get a job,

38:50.411 --> 38:52.705
my family's gonna disown me,
and my best friend's

38:52.705 --> 38:54.207
never gonna look me
in my fucking eye.

38:54.207 --> 38:55.625
Edwin, listen.

38:55.625 --> 38:59.295
Edwin, Greg and I didn't tell
anyone anything, okay?

38:59.295 --> 39:01.506
Fuck off. I see you all.

39:01.506 --> 39:04.384
I see you all whispering
and laughing at me.

39:04.384 --> 39:06.386
Edwin, I would never

39:06.386 --> 39:08.555
out another man.

39:08.555 --> 39:11.391
Especially a Black man.

39:11.391 --> 39:13.518
Edwin,

39:13.518 --> 39:16.437
Edwin, listen to me.

39:16.437 --> 39:20.400
I grew up in a place in America

39:20.400 --> 39:23.862
where I had to hide who I was

39:23.862 --> 39:26.197
or face violence.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.241
For years,

39:28.241 --> 39:30.743
I prayed for the day
where I could move

39:30.743 --> 39:32.954
to a more accepting place.

39:32.954 --> 39:36.916
And when I finally did,

39:36.916 --> 39:39.294
I promised myself,

39:39.294 --> 39:42.255
if I ever had the means
to help someone, I would.

39:45.216 --> 39:48.303
One day, I hope you use it

39:48.303 --> 39:51.055
to get somewhere
where you can live freely.

39:56.394 --> 39:57.812
Like New York.

39:57.812 --> 40:01.190
Yeah.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.067
Like New York.

40:07.989 --> 40:10.700
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

40:10.700 --> 40:13.369
It's okay.

40:20.251 --> 40:21.920
So Desmond told you.

40:21.920 --> 40:25.298
It's bullshit, right?

40:25.298 --> 40:27.008
Tell me it's bullshit.

40:27.008 --> 40:29.052
It is irrelevant.

40:31.638 --> 40:32.972
What is irrelevant about

40:32.972 --> 40:36.225
my best friend stopping you
from being with me,

40:36.225 --> 40:37.769
stopping me from being happy?

40:37.769 --> 40:40.021
Gogo,

40:40.021 --> 40:44.692
if I had true feelings for you,
then we would be together,

40:44.692 --> 40:46.486
no matter what Edwin said
or did.

40:46.486 --> 40:48.154
I don't believe that.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.075
Since we were kids,

40:52.075 --> 40:56.454
you know you look at me
and see someone I am not.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.623
A government minister's
daughter,

40:58.623 --> 41:01.584
this person to revere
and admire, but...

41:01.584 --> 41:04.087
I'm not the daughter
of a minister.

41:04.087 --> 41:07.298
I am the daughter of a woman

41:07.298 --> 41:09.592
who lost everything

41:09.592 --> 41:12.470
and is now deranged and cruel,

41:12.470 --> 41:15.390
and maybe one day,
I gonna be just like she.

41:15.390 --> 41:19.018
And I accept my fate.
- No, don't say that.

41:19.018 --> 41:20.478
Don't say that.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.689
You are smart and beautiful,
and you deserve the world,

41:22.689 --> 41:24.982
and I am gonna give it to you.

41:24.982 --> 41:28.778
Clive,

41:28.778 --> 41:32.240
you don't know me.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.992
You never have.

41:34.992 --> 41:39.205
And I don't know what might be
missing in your life

41:39.205 --> 41:44.293
that I represent, but...

41:44.293 --> 41:47.964
what you feel for me
is not true.

41:47.964 --> 41:51.926
You wrong.

41:51.926 --> 41:54.470
I do know you.

41:54.470 --> 41:56.931
And I do love you.

41:56.931 --> 41:58.474
If Edwin hadn't got in the way,

41:58.474 --> 42:00.977
you would've realized
you loved me too.

42:00.977 --> 42:03.020
Clive. Clive.

42:17.368 --> 42:18.870
I went to the gift shop
with Mom

42:18.870 --> 42:22.206
and got all
of our favorite candies.

42:22.206 --> 42:24.000
I'm sorry, Clairey.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.753
Can we do candy and movie night
when we get home?

42:26.753 --> 42:28.337
I have, like,
three whole days off

42:28.337 --> 42:30.757
before I have to go to school,
which means

42:30.757 --> 42:33.968
we can even do it twice
if you want.

42:33.968 --> 42:35.845
But you promised.

42:35.845 --> 42:38.931
Claire, you can eat candy
and watch a movie by yourself.

42:38.931 --> 42:40.892
Okay?

42:40.892 --> 42:43.686
I promise you,
you will get over this.

42:43.686 --> 42:45.396
Okay?

42:45.396 --> 42:47.565
I love you. Bye.

42:57.158 --> 43:01.162
I mean, um, we got
to do this.

43:01.162 --> 43:04.165
I thought she was hanging out
with her sister tonight.

43:04.165 --> 43:05.166
Bitch.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.635
Mm, I hope you're ready, Goges.

43:15.635 --> 43:18.262
Tonight we will lime
like it's 1999.

43:18.262 --> 43:19.722
You know what I'm...

43:19.722 --> 43:25.186
I know
what you did... to Sara.

43:25.186 --> 43:27.313
Hey, boys.

43:27.313 --> 43:28.689
I'm excited.

43:30.900 --> 43:32.443
Hi.

43:32.443 --> 43:36.155
How far away is Paulette's?

43:36.155 --> 43:38.366
Is this okay to wear?

43:38.366 --> 43:40.409
You look--

43:40.409 --> 43:43.371
you look just fine, Alison.

43:43.371 --> 43:44.413
Thanks.

43:45.957 --> 43:48.084
Nice ride.

43:48.084 --> 43:49.502
Oh, thank you very much.

43:51.838 --> 43:54.590
Come on.
Let's go.

44:17.738 --> 44:19.740
Hey.
Hey.

44:19.740 --> 44:20.950
I reached out
to everyone we know.

44:20.950 --> 44:22.368
No one's heard from her.

44:22.368 --> 44:24.162
You, anything?
Nothing.

44:24.162 --> 44:26.122
I went to the waterfront.
I checked Clive's apartment,

44:26.122 --> 44:29.208
the Little Sugar: there's no
sign of him or Emily anywhere.

44:29.208 --> 44:30.543
Should we call the police?

44:30.543 --> 44:32.587
What are they gonna do?
I mean, let's face it, Josh.

44:32.587 --> 44:34.547
If Emily's with Clive,
she went willingly.

44:34.547 --> 44:37.258
- Should we call her parents?
- I don't know.

44:37.258 --> 44:40.636
How the fuck am I gonna
explain this to them?

44:40.636 --> 44:41.971
How could she do this?

45:10.333 --> 45:12.543
I thought you left.

45:12.543 --> 45:14.003
Get in.

45:19.800 --> 45:22.011
I said get in.
