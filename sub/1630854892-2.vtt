00:07.258 --> 00:09.802
Sang can be conceited,
vain, narcissistic,

00:09.802 --> 00:11.595
but he's not a bad person.

00:11.595 --> 00:13.472
- Can I help you?
- Regus Patoff.

00:13.472 --> 00:16.851
I am to consult with Mr. Sang
on all matters of business.

00:16.851 --> 00:21.522
You'll find this illustrates
Mr. Sang's wishes.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.774
- Who owns us?
- Sang's only living relative,

00:23.774 --> 00:26.819
his mother, who lives in Busan
and speaks no English.

00:26.819 --> 00:28.195
What do you do here?

00:28.195 --> 00:30.156
I was Sang's creative liaison.

00:30.156 --> 00:32.992
- Creative liaison?
- I gave myself a title bump.

00:32.992 --> 00:36.036
You're saying this guy waltzed
in off the street one day

00:36.036 --> 00:38.247
and got Sang to sign over
complete authority?

00:38.247 --> 00:39.415
I don't buy it.

00:39.415 --> 00:41.834
Do you smell that?
It's like putrid fruit.

01:17.036 --> 01:18.996
Hello?

01:18.996 --> 01:22.708
Elaine, it's Regus Patoff.

01:22.708 --> 01:25.753
Mr. Pa...is everything okay?

01:28.923 --> 01:30.549
It's 3:00 in the morning.

01:32.510 --> 01:34.970
I was calling to ask
if you'd be available

01:34.970 --> 01:38.307
to come into the office
a little earlier than normal.

01:40.142 --> 01:43.103
Um, sure.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.899
If it's urgent,
I can be there at 8:00.

01:46.899 --> 01:49.068
That is disappointing.

01:49.068 --> 01:51.987
I was hoping for something
more immediate.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.678
Hello?

02:15.678 --> 02:18.556
Elaine, it's Regus Patoff.

02:18.556 --> 02:20.641
Yes, Mr. Patoff.
We just spoke.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.394
I was calling to ask if you
would be available

02:23.394 --> 02:26.230
to come into the office
a little earlier than normal.

02:29.859 --> 02:32.069
I can be there in 40 minutes.

03:15.988 --> 03:18.032
My name is Elaine Hayman.

03:18.032 --> 03:21.785
It's 3:23 on Tuesday morning,

03:21.785 --> 03:23.871
and at the time
of this recording,

03:23.871 --> 03:25.372
I'm driving to

03:25.372 --> 03:29.960
the offices of CompWare
in downtown LA.

03:29.960 --> 03:33.130
If something should happen to
me, and this message is pulled

03:33.130 --> 03:35.966
off my cloud,
I hope it can shed some light

03:35.966 --> 03:38.218
on what may have transpired.

03:39.970 --> 03:43.474
As creative liaison for one
of the most successful

03:43.474 --> 03:45.643
mobile games studios
in Los Angeles,

03:45.643 --> 03:50.356
I expect hard work
and long hours.

03:50.356 --> 03:52.316
I have always
been willing to do

03:52.316 --> 03:53.734
whatever it takes to succeed.

03:55.361 --> 03:58.197
But I don't know where
this man came from.

03:58.197 --> 04:01.367
I don't know how he rose
to this position.

04:02.952 --> 04:05.245
And I don't know
what authority he carries.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.794
In.

04:15.172 --> 04:18.217
What took you so long?

04:18.217 --> 04:20.386
I drove in from the Valley.

04:20.386 --> 04:23.263
Can't you live closer?

04:23.263 --> 04:26.600
I share an apartment
with two struggling actors.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.519
It's pretty much all we can
afford.

04:28.519 --> 04:31.397
4866 Magnolia.

04:34.525 --> 04:36.068
You know where I live?

04:36.068 --> 04:39.738
With Elijah and Daisy.

04:39.738 --> 04:42.658
They're not quite actors.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.576
What is that?

04:44.576 --> 04:45.786
Is that about me?

04:45.786 --> 04:47.246
That's your personnel file.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.832
I came by it
in the records room.

04:49.832 --> 04:51.291
We have a records room?

04:51.291 --> 04:53.127
Of course.

04:53.127 --> 04:57.172
Every company I ever consulted
at has a records room.

04:57.172 --> 05:00.884
I just assumed everything
was on the server.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.262
Sang promised
we were carbon-neutral.

05:03.262 --> 05:05.681
You can learn so much
from these files.

05:05.681 --> 05:08.559
For example, did you know
that the average age

05:08.559 --> 05:12.062
of CompWare employees is 27?
You're 27.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.897
That the average level

05:13.897 --> 05:15.649
of education is
a bachelor's degree?

05:15.649 --> 05:17.609
You have a bachelor's degree.

05:17.609 --> 05:21.739
That the average salary
is $62,000?

05:21.739 --> 05:24.324
Sadly, you earn
just a hair under.

05:26.035 --> 05:28.662
You called me in
at 3:00 a.m.

05:28.662 --> 05:32.166
in my sweatpants to tell me
that I'm average?

05:37.796 --> 05:39.381
Assorted churros.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.675
Two cinnamon.
Two matcha crunch.

05:41.675 --> 05:45.220
Two, uh, dark chocolate
with pistachio.

05:49.058 --> 05:50.392
Elaine?

05:50.392 --> 05:52.144
What?

05:52.144 --> 05:53.729
Cinnamon,
matcha crunch

05:53.729 --> 05:57.399
or dark chocolate
with pistachio?

05:57.399 --> 05:59.485
I'm not much of
a breakfast person.

05:59.485 --> 06:01.487
You have to drive
a long way

06:01.487 --> 06:04.198
to find churros
at 3:00 in the morning.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.283
That'll be all, Dana.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.576
Huh.

06:11.497 --> 06:13.957
Sit.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.258
Why am I here,
Mr. Patoff?

06:25.469 --> 06:29.431
A flight departed Seoul Airport
an hour and 20 minutes ago,

06:29.431 --> 06:31.767
destined for Los Angeles.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.477
There's a passenger on board

06:33.477 --> 06:36.563
who is detrimental
to Mr. Sang's interests.

06:36.563 --> 06:40.067
They must not complete
this journey.

06:43.028 --> 06:47.407
You want me to turn a commercial
aircraft around mid-flight?

06:47.407 --> 06:49.409
You're a natural
problem-solver, Elaine.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.078
It says so in your file.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.914
- It does?
- Mmm.

06:53.914 --> 06:58.043
Who is this person
on this flight?

07:03.090 --> 07:04.550
Ahn Si-Woo.

07:06.051 --> 07:10.472
Sang's mother?
She's coming here?

07:10.472 --> 07:13.267
She intends to dismember
and demolish

07:13.267 --> 07:14.893
everything Mr. Sang created.

07:17.688 --> 07:19.231
His dream.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.568
His destiny.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.655
He fucked his what?

07:26.655 --> 07:28.031
His face.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.324
His mouth.

07:29.324 --> 07:30.367
Ugh.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.619
His throat.
I mean, not nicely.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.622
Babe, if this is what
I think it is, you need

07:35.622 --> 07:38.333
- to involve the authorities.
- No, no, no. We're going to.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.085
We? Who else saw this?

07:40.085 --> 07:42.337
Um, just me and Elaine.

07:44.089 --> 07:47.843
- You guys hanging out again?
- No, we're not hanging out.

07:47.843 --> 07:50.304
We're just stuck in the same
shitty, sink-y boat.

07:50.304 --> 07:51.305
Mm-hmm.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.183
Yeah.

07:54.183 --> 07:55.767
Hmm.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.357
Okay. Well, I'll swing
by and get you after work,

08:02.357 --> 08:04.526
and then you can help
with the shopping.

08:04.526 --> 08:05.527
Good times ahead.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.279
- Mm-hmm.
- Love you.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.239
Have fun.

08:09.239 --> 08:12.242
Oh, and babe,
if that bad man tries

08:12.242 --> 08:15.245
to put something in your mouth,
you come and tell Mama.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.387
What happened?

08:32.387 --> 08:34.848
He's thrown the entire
development slate out.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.183
Since when?

08:36.183 --> 08:37.601
Since 5:30
this morning.

08:49.196 --> 08:52.282
Are you...
He can't just shit-can

08:52.282 --> 08:54.076
everything we've been
working on!

08:54.076 --> 08:55.702
I heard Kerfuffle
got swallowed up.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.163
Ninety-five more of us
looking for work.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.791
Kerfuffle?

09:00.791 --> 09:04.378
Oh, no. Fuck him.

09:04.378 --> 09:05.879
Fuck him!

09:12.594 --> 09:14.638
Where are you going?

09:14.638 --> 09:17.349
I just spent the last ten weeks
mo-capping shitting cats.

09:17.349 --> 09:20.352
Why? Because Sang paid me $5800
a month to do so.

09:20.352 --> 09:23.230
I made my peace with that.
Now, face-fucker blows into town

09:23.230 --> 09:25.941
and thinks he can throw that all
away like it's meaningless?

09:25.941 --> 09:28.193
- I'm not gonna fucking put...
- Craig, take the day.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.237
Think this through before
you do something that

09:30.237 --> 09:31.780
- you might actually regret.
- Patti's earning.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.824
Rent'll get paid.
I'm gonna take my chances.

09:33.824 --> 09:36.910
- Ok, he's in a strange mood.
- He is a strange mood!

09:36.910 --> 09:38.578
- Stand aside.
- Hey.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.747
Sang's mother
is on her way from Seoul.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.791
- What?
- Her flight lands any minute.

09:42.791 --> 09:45.210
Well, why didn't you
tell me that?

09:45.210 --> 09:48.964
Oh, my God.
I almost just quit my job.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.967
I don't know what
her intentions are.

09:51.967 --> 09:53.969
But you think
she's bringing lawyers?

09:59.474 --> 10:01.601
- Well?
- Change of strategy.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.353
Guys, huddle up.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.564
Alright. Here's the play.
Keep our heads down,

10:05.564 --> 10:08.275
make it look like we're busy,
'cause the new suit,

10:08.275 --> 10:11.236
he's not gonna be around
much longer.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.613
Shh.

10:36.845 --> 10:39.639
Excuse me... Can you help me?

10:41.141 --> 10:44.478
I'm sorry.
I don't speak this.

10:44.478 --> 10:47.022
You will need to select
your chosen language and...

10:47.022 --> 10:48.940
Oh! Hold on one moment.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.401
It's just going to show us
some advertisements first.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.280
Sang-Woo... I am his mother...

10:57.157 --> 10:58.617
Mrs. Ahn?

10:58.617 --> 11:00.452
Sang-Woo.
Sang-Woo.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.245
Yes.
You're in the right place.

11:02.245 --> 11:05.248
Um, my name is Elaine Hayman.
I worked with your son.

11:05.248 --> 11:07.250
Come and sit.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.461
Rosie, can you get us
some water?

11:09.461 --> 11:10.504
Uh-huh.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.923
I'll take your bag.

11:18.261 --> 11:21.181
Comrades!
Your attention, please.

11:30.690 --> 11:34.069
Today, we have
a very special visitor,

11:34.069 --> 11:36.196
Mama Sang,

11:36.196 --> 11:39.741
whose beautiful son was
so violently, brutally slain

11:39.741 --> 11:42.828
on this very soil.

11:42.828 --> 11:45.997
On behalf of all Mr. Sang's
humble servants...

11:47.249 --> 11:51.294
Let us take your pain away.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.577
Speak.

12:23.577 --> 12:24.786
Open your heart.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.503
My son...

12:35.505 --> 12:37.257
was a good boy.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.593
Sang was a good boy.

12:41.428 --> 12:45.182
He had love in his heart.

12:45.182 --> 12:46.850
He loved us all.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.479
But...

12:50.479 --> 12:53.148
he was taken by the devil.

12:56.568 --> 12:59.654
To honor his memory,
work harder.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.072
Dana?

13:42.072 --> 13:45.116
Do we know if Mama Sang has
an arrangement for tonight?

13:45.116 --> 13:47.744
She walked in with her suitcase.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.162
Nobody's told me anything.

13:49.162 --> 13:52.165
Book her a suite
at the Penrith.

13:52.165 --> 13:55.585
That's where Sang treated
all of his visiting VIPs.

13:55.585 --> 13:58.296
I think that's what he
would've wanted for his mother.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.464
Okay. I'm confused.

13:59.464 --> 14:02.217
Am I his assistant now
or is it still you?

14:02.217 --> 14:06.054
You are.
I'm his creative liaison.

14:06.054 --> 14:08.348
Remind me again, what is that?

14:09.683 --> 14:12.185
How much pressure
do you think it would take

14:12.185 --> 14:13.311
to break that glass?

14:13.311 --> 14:15.272
- Upskirt gallery?
- Yeah.

14:15.272 --> 14:17.482
You could stand
an elephant up there.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.317
An elephant? Nah.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.860
A couple of rhinos, maybe.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.904
Two rhinos weigh
more than one elephant.

14:22.904 --> 14:24.155
That doesn't sound right.

14:26.116 --> 14:28.076
Hey. Do you want to
get lunch?

14:28.076 --> 14:30.078
Sorry. We're busy
pretending to be busy.

14:30.078 --> 14:33.331
Ha. What do you know?
Elephants weigh 13,000 pounds.

14:33.331 --> 14:36.626
- Rhinos top out at 7,000.
- Yeah. The glass is so strong,

14:36.626 --> 14:39.296
an elephant could fuck a rhino
right above us.

14:39.296 --> 14:41.172
- Wanna put money on that?
- No.

14:41.172 --> 14:43.550
Actually, we're going to...

14:43.550 --> 14:46.386
I'm gonna go to lunch first.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.680
When does
the cavalry arrive?

14:48.680 --> 14:50.640
Maybe she hasn't retained
anyone yet.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.851
It's only been two weeks.
She's still grieving.

14:52.851 --> 14:54.603
Of course he speaks
fluent fucking Korean.

14:54.603 --> 14:57.355
Why wouldn't he speak Korean?
He could be telling her anything

14:57.355 --> 14:59.858
up there. What if he gets her
to sign something?

14:59.858 --> 15:02.110
Why do you expect me to have
the answers?

15:02.110 --> 15:05.155
- This could take months.
- If it does, we wait it out.

15:05.155 --> 15:07.365
No. You saw what he did to Sang.

15:07.365 --> 15:10.702
We can't work for this sick
son of a bitch, can we?

15:12.245 --> 15:14.039
Apparently some of us can.

15:14.039 --> 15:16.958
Six months with this job title
is all I need.

15:16.958 --> 15:20.045
Sang can't write me a personal
reference. Patoff can.

15:20.045 --> 15:22.756
Huh. Did you think you were
gonna impress the boss

15:22.756 --> 15:24.382
with sweatpants and
the hair scrunchie?

15:24.382 --> 15:27.385
- He called me in at 3:00 a.m...
- My God.

15:27.385 --> 15:30.138
- ...to stop a 747 mid-flight.
- This motherfucker is so crazy.

15:30.138 --> 15:33.683
- We have to do the right thing.
- Agreed. I just...

15:33.683 --> 15:37.646
I'm too tired. I don't know.
What is the right thing?

15:39.147 --> 15:42.442
- We give Mama Sang the tape.
- She doesn't need to see that.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.487
Course she doesn't, but if it'll
speed up the removal process,

15:45.487 --> 15:49.574
that's what we have to do.
What the fuck is he up to now?

15:53.995 --> 15:55.872
Are you leaving,
Mr. Patoff?

15:55.872 --> 15:58.625
Well, Dana was
considerate enough

15:58.625 --> 16:01.252
to book Mama Sang
a room at the Penrith.

16:01.252 --> 16:03.046
I'm escorting her there now.

16:03.046 --> 16:06.091
Uh, Mr. Patoff, Dana
wanted me to give you this.

16:06.091 --> 16:07.759
It's the address
to the hotel.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.428
Would you like me
to arrange a car?

16:10.428 --> 16:12.305
Mr. Sang
would want me

16:12.305 --> 16:14.265
to attend to his mother
personally.

16:14.265 --> 16:16.893
I'll see that she's safely
checked into her hotel.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.228
Okay.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.897
This way, good lady.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.401
Oh, her suitcase.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.448
What would we do
without you, Elaine?

16:37.330 --> 16:40.750
What's it called when somebody
fucks the son and the mother?

16:40.750 --> 16:42.836
There's gotta be
a name for that.

17:04.274 --> 17:06.526
Hey, Iain.

17:06.526 --> 17:10.113
If I wanted to see my
personnel file, who do I ask?

17:10.113 --> 17:12.282
Fill out a request on
the home site.

17:12.282 --> 17:13.908
You'll receive it
by secure email.

17:13.908 --> 17:15.535
No. I mean the paper copy.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.704
I wanna see what's in
the records room.

17:17.704 --> 17:18.788
The what?

17:18.788 --> 17:21.541
The records room?

17:21.541 --> 17:24.210
You don't know
about the records room?

17:24.210 --> 17:26.671
I think we have
a storeroom.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.381
Whereabouts?

18:26.981 --> 18:29.818
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

18:29.818 --> 18:32.779
No, no, no. No, no, no!
No.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.532
If you don't give it
to Mama Sang, I will,

18:35.532 --> 18:38.576
because I am not coming here
tomorrow if he's still here.

18:42.997 --> 18:46.251
Fine. I'll do it.

18:46.251 --> 18:47.669
Pinky promise?

19:13.361 --> 19:14.737
Thank you.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.994
- Hi.
- Hi. Checking in?

19:20.994 --> 19:23.997
I'm visiting a guest.
It was booked under CompWare.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.376
We have the reservation,

19:28.376 --> 19:30.837
but no one's checked in
under that booking yet.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.797
She's not here?

19:55.069 --> 19:57.405
- Hey.
- I'm at the hotel,

19:57.405 --> 19:59.449
but Mother Sang
hasn't checked in yet.

19:59.449 --> 20:00.950
What? Wasn't he driving her?

20:00.950 --> 20:03.411
Maybe he took her to dinner?

20:03.411 --> 20:06.748
Maybe she's in the trunk of his
car, chopped up into filets.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.963
- Oh, fuck. He's here.
- At your apartment?

20:13.963 --> 20:16.466
No, the office. I'm still here.
He walked in.

20:16.466 --> 20:18.176
- Is he alone?
- I don't know.

20:19.469 --> 20:20.678
Yep, he's alone.

20:20.678 --> 20:24.015
- Ask him where she is.
- You fucking ask him.

20:25.475 --> 20:27.060
Fine. I will.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.686
Okay. Bye.

20:40.865 --> 20:44.285
It's rather late for you to be
telephoning me, Elaine.

20:44.285 --> 20:45.954
I know. I'm sorry.

20:45.954 --> 20:48.164
It's just that the staff
had a collection

20:48.164 --> 20:50.416
and thought it would be
a nice gesture

20:50.416 --> 20:54.420
to send Mother Sang some flowers
or maybe a platter of fruit.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.631
We all loved Sang so much.

20:56.631 --> 20:58.424
If you think it's appropriate.

20:58.424 --> 21:02.095
What room or suite number
should I put on the delivery,

21:02.095 --> 21:04.764
Mr. Patoff?

21:04.764 --> 21:07.642
It was the Penrith you checked
her into, wasn't it?

21:07.642 --> 21:09.894
No. Mother Sang
had other arrangements.

21:09.894 --> 21:12.146
We can go ahead and cancel
the hotel.

21:12.146 --> 21:14.148
Oh.

21:14.148 --> 21:16.442
Where is she staying?

21:16.442 --> 21:18.695
She didn't say.

21:19.988 --> 21:22.031
But you dropped her off
somewhere?

21:22.031 --> 21:23.783
With her suitcase?

21:23.783 --> 21:26.536
Where were we now?

21:26.536 --> 21:29.080
Yes. Do try and think.

21:30.581 --> 21:35.211
I remember seeing these little
pedal boats that look like swans

21:35.211 --> 21:37.880
and thinking how funny they are.

21:40.091 --> 21:42.969
Dana, I need you to
call around all the hotels

21:42.969 --> 21:44.595
in the MacArthur Park area

21:44.595 --> 21:47.390
and find out if they've
checked in Ahn Si-Woo.

21:47.390 --> 21:49.434
I'm in a bath, Elaine.

21:49.434 --> 21:51.477
Yes, but you're holding a phone.

22:27.430 --> 22:29.307
Excuse me.

22:29.307 --> 22:31.267
Have you seen
a Korean lady, fifties,

22:31.267 --> 22:32.977
pulling a big
purple suitcase?

22:32.977 --> 22:35.229
Sorry. No.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.443
Excuse me?

22:40.443 --> 22:42.653
I'm looking for
a middle-aged Korean woman

22:42.653 --> 22:44.197
with a purple suitcase.

22:45.448 --> 22:46.699
No.

22:58.002 --> 22:59.629
Craig.

22:59.629 --> 23:01.422
Mr. Patoff.

23:01.422 --> 23:04.175
Still working.
That is commendable.

23:04.175 --> 23:07.303
I'm just, uh,
waiting on a ride home.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.514
And what is that?

23:09.514 --> 23:11.599
This? This is not
really anything yet.

23:11.599 --> 23:13.935
Uh-huh.
Explain it to me.

23:13.935 --> 23:15.603
Oh, okay.

23:15.603 --> 23:18.940
Um, well, it's based on
the tensile strength of glass.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.858
So, you see this blue line here?

23:20.858 --> 23:23.903
I've linked this to the URL
of a glass load calculator.

23:23.903 --> 23:28.157
The thicker the glass, the more
you can put on it. So...

23:28.157 --> 23:30.368
An elephant,
and that's okay.

23:30.368 --> 23:34.413
And then, elephant and a rhino,
that's still okay.

23:35.998 --> 23:39.585
Elephant, rhino, monkey.

23:39.585 --> 23:42.880
Bad monkey.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.715
Where do they go?

23:44.715 --> 23:47.885
- They just fall to the bottom.
- What's at the bottom?

23:47.885 --> 23:49.011
Could be anything.

23:49.011 --> 23:51.889
Could be some metal spikes

23:51.889 --> 23:53.933
or trampolines,

23:53.933 --> 23:57.854
or, um, anything.

23:57.854 --> 24:02.441
What do you want it
to be, Craig?

24:02.441 --> 24:06.154
What do you want to find
when you stop falling?

24:08.239 --> 24:10.825
I want to play.
When is it ready?

24:10.825 --> 24:12.827
Um, I...

24:12.827 --> 24:16.122
Maybe we should talk to
Elaine first.

24:16.122 --> 24:19.959
- Elaine?
- She's your creative liaison.

24:19.959 --> 24:23.254
This is sort of what she does,
so that you and I

24:23.254 --> 24:25.423
- don't have to do this.
- Of course. Elaine.

24:25.423 --> 24:26.799
Between the two of us,

24:26.799 --> 24:29.510
I was beginning to wonder
what she does around here.

24:29.510 --> 24:31.512
Good work.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.055
Thanks, boss.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.430
He wants to make it.

25:14.430 --> 25:15.973
What?

25:15.973 --> 25:19.018
In two years, Sang never took
a pitch I gave him.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.562
Patoff shows up and
within a couple of days...

25:21.562 --> 25:22.897
He killed Mama Sang!

25:22.897 --> 25:24.941
Wait. What?

25:24.941 --> 25:28.778
I don't know where she is.
Dana can't trace her. I...

25:28.778 --> 25:30.154
Should I call the police?

25:30.154 --> 25:31.906
No. And what? And say what?

25:31.906 --> 25:34.492
That we lost a tourist?
I mean, come on.

25:34.492 --> 25:37.787
Maybe she just needs a little
time to, you know, to grieve.

25:41.749 --> 25:42.833
Goodnight, Craig.

25:42.833 --> 25:45.336
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What?

25:45.336 --> 25:47.004
What? Are you pissed at me?

25:47.004 --> 25:49.799
I'm too tired to be pissed
with you.

25:49.799 --> 25:51.968
I ache.
I've had three hours of sleep.

25:51.968 --> 25:54.971
All I've had to eat is
a hot tea and churros.

25:54.971 --> 25:56.639
I can't see straight, and now,

25:56.639 --> 25:59.350
I have to drive 40 minutes out
to the Valley!

25:59.350 --> 26:01.269
Did you hear they shut the 101?

26:01.269 --> 26:03.020
Oh, fuck my fucking life!

26:04.355 --> 26:06.774
Yeah.
It's crawling over the canyon.

26:06.774 --> 26:08.442
My carriage approaches.
Are you okay?

26:08.442 --> 26:10.778
Always.

26:10.778 --> 26:12.697
Okay. Well, try
and get some sleep,

26:12.697 --> 26:14.991
'cause we got work tomorrow.

26:14.991 --> 26:16.826
- Okay.
- Bye.
