WEBVTT

02:31.083 --> 02:33.541
-Shall I?

02:33.625 --> 02:35.458
-Best if you let us do it.
-Right.

02:41.083 --> 02:43.500
NIGEL:
There you go, Mr. Hazelwood.

02:44.541 --> 02:46.916
You've landed in quite
a lovely spot, haven't you?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.833
And with a view of the sea.

02:49.875 --> 02:52.083
-Are you a nurse?
-Oh.

02:52.166 --> 02:53.666
Teacher.

02:53.750 --> 02:55.666
I-I mean, I-I was. I'm...

02:55.750 --> 02:57.291
I'm retired.

03:02.416 --> 03:05.166
Pamela will be here every day
to bathe and exercise him.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.375
I'll be around twice a week
to check his observations

03:07.458 --> 03:08.958
and adjust his medication.

03:09.041 --> 03:10.416
But you'll have charge of his meals

03:10.500 --> 03:12.708
and anything else that comes up
while we're not here.

03:12.791 --> 03:14.500
-I understand.
-And he can feed himself,

03:14.583 --> 03:16.541
though he sometimes makes a mess of it.

03:16.625 --> 03:18.125
And you have to watch for him choking.

03:18.208 --> 03:19.958
-That's from the dysphagia...
-Difficulty in swallowing.

03:20.041 --> 03:22.916
I'm to cut his food
into small pieces or puree it

03:23.000 --> 03:25.916
and make sure he drinks
a sufficient amount of water.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.583
-I've been reading up about it.

03:28.666 --> 03:31.083
-Well, you deserve a gold star, don't you?

03:31.166 --> 03:33.083
This is Mr. Hazelwood's personal items.

03:33.166 --> 03:35.791
They came to the hospital
after he sold the house.

03:43.250 --> 03:45.416
Is there anything else I should know?

03:45.500 --> 03:47.541
Oh. No cigarettes.

03:47.625 --> 03:49.208
He will try and get one out of you.

03:49.291 --> 03:51.583
Oh, we don't keep them in the house.

04:08.625 --> 04:10.375
TOM:
Run, Bobby! Bobby!

04:31.333 --> 04:32.708
What's this about?

04:36.916 --> 04:38.833
I thought he was staying
in the spare room.

04:38.916 --> 04:41.125
He's not a prisoner.

04:41.208 --> 04:42.708
This is my home.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.125
Isn't it?

04:46.375 --> 04:48.583
For God's sake, Marion,
I can only stand so much.

04:55.958 --> 04:58.791
There are places for invalids.

05:00.208 --> 05:02.791
Have you been inside any of those places?

05:02.875 --> 05:05.416
-Besides, you agreed.
-Well...

05:05.500 --> 05:07.791
You wouldn't give me any rest until I did.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.875
Seemed the right thing to do.

05:09.958 --> 05:11.916
Don't fool yourself.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.625
You know why you brought him here.

05:13.708 --> 05:14.875
Why?

05:14.958 --> 05:17.125
To punish him.

05:17.208 --> 05:19.041
That's ridiculous.

05:20.458 --> 05:23.750
You waiting on him hand and foot,
that's ridiculous.

07:09.625 --> 07:11.541
MARION:
Here is an interesting bit

07:11.625 --> 07:13.541
in the Arts section.

07:16.666 --> 07:19.250
A young woman has been short-listed

07:19.333 --> 07:21.958
for the Turner Prize

07:22.041 --> 07:24.041
with a piece called My Bed.

07:26.125 --> 07:28.875
That's exactly what it is.

07:28.958 --> 07:30.958
Unmade no less.

07:32.208 --> 07:35.000
Apparently, everyone's talking about it.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.083
I'd like to see it.

07:42.666 --> 07:46.333
You were the one
who taught me to look at art.

07:46.416 --> 07:47.750
Do you remember?

07:50.041 --> 07:51.333
Ohk.

07:51.416 --> 07:53.666
-I don't...

07:56.166 --> 07:57.750
:
Ohk.

07:57.833 --> 07:59.666
I can't understand.

07:59.750 --> 08:02.291
Sm.

08:02.375 --> 08:03.750
Ohk.

08:03.833 --> 08:05.083
You want to smoke.

08:06.833 --> 08:08.791
-Nigel says you can't.

08:08.875 --> 08:10.333
You've had a stroke.

08:10.416 --> 08:13.166
-It could cause you to have another.

08:14.416 --> 08:16.166
-Eeev.
-Patrick.

08:16.250 --> 08:18.291
I absolutely cannot allow you...

08:18.375 --> 08:19.875
Eeev!

08:21.416 --> 08:23.666
Leave?

08:26.291 --> 08:27.958
Fine.

08:29.625 --> 08:31.250
MARION:
Bastard.

09:34.625 --> 09:36.208
You said you'd ask.

09:36.291 --> 09:38.958
-It was your idea.
-He's your brother.

09:39.041 --> 09:40.625
SYLVIE:
I wouldn't get my hopes up for Tom.

09:40.708 --> 09:41.833
MARION:
I'm not.

09:41.916 --> 09:45.166
He likes, you know, l-loud, busty types.

09:47.125 --> 09:49.041
What do you think, ladies?
Are we getting wet today?

09:50.291 --> 09:52.458
Marion can't swim.

09:52.541 --> 09:53.750
-I can.

09:53.833 --> 09:56.250
I'm just, I'm just not very good.

09:56.333 --> 09:59.000
She wants to ask for a lesson,
Tom, but she's too shy to ask!

09:59.083 --> 10:00.166
Sylvie!

10:01.333 --> 10:02.583
Well, how about I give you a lesson?

10:02.666 --> 10:03.708
-No, no, no, no!
-Come on!

10:13.625 --> 10:15.541
They're a couple of cards, aren't they?

10:15.625 --> 10:16.833
MARION:
Yes.

10:18.583 --> 10:20.000
Almost didn't recognize you.

10:20.083 --> 10:23.291
Been a while since
you came around to the house.

10:23.375 --> 10:25.041
I've been at teacher training college.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.083
Yeah, Sylvie said.

10:28.208 --> 10:29.916
And you were stationed...?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.791
Up north.

10:31.875 --> 10:34.666
Yeah, glad to have that behind me.

10:34.750 --> 10:36.375
I'm a policeman now.

10:36.458 --> 10:38.583
I heard.

10:38.666 --> 10:39.916
Must be quite fulfilling.

10:44.958 --> 10:47.208
Well, you can't go through life
afraid of the water.

10:49.041 --> 10:51.458
It's too cold.

10:51.541 --> 10:54.000
You can start in the lido if you like.

10:54.083 --> 10:55.333
All right.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.375
It's cold.

11:11.333 --> 11:14.250
-Right. When I tell you...
-Mm-hmm.

11:14.333 --> 11:16.666
...you need to throw your legs behind you.

11:16.750 --> 11:18.541
Arms out.

11:18.625 --> 11:21.083
And then kick.

11:21.166 --> 11:22.375
Go.

11:23.833 --> 11:25.333
Oh, I'm so sorry.

11:30.500 --> 11:31.916
Good.

11:37.333 --> 11:39.416
-That's it. You got it.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.333
MARION:
Thanks for the lessons.

11:42.416 --> 11:43.791
You did quite well.

11:43.875 --> 11:45.833
-You should stick with it.

11:47.291 --> 11:49.625
I suppose I'll head home.

11:49.708 --> 11:52.041
-I was thinking.
-Yes?

11:52.125 --> 11:54.666
You being a teacher,
you must be a bit of a bookworm.

11:56.125 --> 11:58.833
Well, I don't know how to take that.

11:58.916 --> 12:00.833
But I suppose it's true.

12:00.916 --> 12:03.125
Sorry, no, I didn't mean...

12:04.583 --> 12:06.958
You see, I'm not much of a reader.

12:07.041 --> 12:08.333
Oh?

12:08.416 --> 12:10.541
But I think a man ought to try
to improve himself.

12:10.625 --> 12:13.000
I agree with you there.

12:13.083 --> 12:14.916
Do you think you could
recommend some books to me?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.375
-In exchange,

12:16.458 --> 12:18.500
I could give you more swimming lessons.

12:18.583 --> 12:21.250
Yes, I'd be happy to recommend books.

12:21.333 --> 12:23.416
-Smashing.

12:27.583 --> 12:29.416
What about art?

12:29.500 --> 12:31.208
You mean books about art?

12:31.291 --> 12:33.708
I never really looked at art before.

12:33.791 --> 12:35.541
Now I think I could
get something out of it.

12:35.625 --> 12:37.291
Well, that's a start.

12:37.375 --> 12:40.291
Did you have
any particular artist in mind?

12:41.416 --> 12:42.750
Mm.

12:43.833 --> 12:46.541
Is there a painter named Turner?

12:46.625 --> 12:49.541
That would be J.M.W. Turner. Yes.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.708
-You're doing really well.

13:13.791 --> 13:15.625
-One more?
-One more.

13:57.125 --> 13:59.583
-That cat, please.

13:59.666 --> 14:01.041
There you are, sir.

14:02.708 --> 14:05.541
-Winner!

14:05.625 --> 14:06.833
Thank you. Thank you.

14:13.666 --> 14:15.041
Hey, no. No, no, no, no.

14:15.125 --> 14:16.750
Not today, boy. Not today. Hey, no.

14:16.833 --> 14:19.041
-Hey. Good boy. Good boy.

14:24.750 --> 14:26.916
Oh. Ahoy.

14:47.333 --> 14:49.250
What the devil do you think you're doing?

14:49.333 --> 14:51.583
-Give me that.

14:51.666 --> 14:53.250
-Patrick. Stop.

14:53.333 --> 14:54.583
Ow!

14:56.791 --> 14:59.375
You could start a fire.

15:02.083 --> 15:03.833
:
Where's Tom?

15:03.916 --> 15:06.000
-What?
-Where's Tom?

15:06.083 --> 15:07.666
-Where's Tom?
-Mm.

15:07.750 --> 15:10.083
Oh, he's...

15:10.166 --> 15:12.250
He's walking Bobby.

15:12.333 --> 15:15.125
-No.
-Well, he-he's swimming.

15:15.208 --> 15:18.250
-No!
-He doesn't want to see you.

15:18.333 --> 15:19.958
He...

15:20.041 --> 15:22.625
He won't even come near your room.

15:22.708 --> 15:25.708
Well, I don't think he'll ever forgive me
for bringing you here.

15:25.791 --> 15:27.791
Bloody mess.

15:39.875 --> 15:41.708
MARION:
The museum?

15:41.791 --> 15:43.750
I'm sure you've been here before.

15:43.833 --> 15:45.041
Well, yes.

15:45.125 --> 15:47.333
But have you ever had a personal tour

15:47.416 --> 15:50.000
from the director
of the Western Art Galleries?

15:50.083 --> 15:52.250
No.

15:52.333 --> 15:53.458
-How did you...
-He was a witness

15:53.541 --> 15:54.916
to an accident on my watch.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.333
Nothing serious, but we got talking,

15:57.416 --> 15:59.500
and he invited me for a private tour.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.583
And I thought, "Marion would enjoy
that sort of thing more than me."

16:03.625 --> 16:06.041
PATRICK:
Notice the light...

16:06.125 --> 16:09.416
striking the crest of the crashing waves.

16:11.583 --> 16:14.875
You feel they could crush you
or take you under.

16:30.958 --> 16:35.041
Blake's trying to startle the senses
as well as the spirit.

16:35.125 --> 16:37.125
There's so much passion in his work.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.291
You just...

16:43.375 --> 16:45.250
have to let it take hold of you.

16:58.041 --> 17:00.708
Now, this is one of my favorite paintings.

17:00.791 --> 17:03.458
Raising of Lazarus by Jan Lievens.

17:03.541 --> 17:05.458
He was a contemporary of Rembrandt.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.041
Astonishing.

17:10.083 --> 17:11.500
:
Exactly.

17:13.708 --> 17:16.166
Thanks ever so much.

17:16.250 --> 17:17.625
It's been splendid.

17:17.708 --> 17:21.125
Oh, I don't know if you're free Friday,
but I have tickets to a recital.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.708
Why don't the two of you join me?

17:22.791 --> 17:24.541
Never been to a recital.

17:24.625 --> 17:26.875
But it's up to Marion.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.041
Um, of course.

17:29.125 --> 17:32.375
Well, I'll see you then. 7:00.

17:32.458 --> 17:34.041
Thank you.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.500
So kind of him to invite us.

17:39.583 --> 17:41.708
I'll be sorry to miss
our library visit, though.

17:41.791 --> 17:43.708
Don't you want to go? I could tell him.

17:43.791 --> 17:46.666
No. No. It would hurt his feelings.

17:46.750 --> 17:49.375
He can't have many friends
his own age if he's invited us.

17:51.541 --> 17:54.333
-I think he's taken with you, that's all.

17:54.416 --> 17:56.125
Don't be silly.

18:40.958 --> 18:42.875
PATRICK:
I love this wine!

18:42.958 --> 18:44.041
It reminds me of Rome.

18:44.125 --> 18:45.541
MARION:
Have you traveled a great deal?

18:45.625 --> 18:48.916
Well, the museum sends me to Italy
now and then to collect new pieces,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.625
and I always try to take
a few days for myself

18:51.708 --> 18:53.750
-and have an adventure.
-Mm.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.291
-How about you?

18:55.375 --> 18:57.625
I've never had the opportunity.
I don't know when I will.

18:57.708 --> 18:59.666
Oh, but you must dream, Marion.

18:59.750 --> 19:01.916
Nothing happens
unless you dream of it first.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.625
-Dream, Marion. Go on.

19:04.708 --> 19:07.541
I suppose it would have to be Venice.

19:07.625 --> 19:10.666
Ah, you're a romantic.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.583
Um, I don't know.

19:12.666 --> 19:17.125
I imagine Venice to be like
something out of another world.

19:17.208 --> 19:18.791
PATRICK:
That it is.

19:18.875 --> 19:21.875
Personally, I'd love to see Mother Russia.

19:21.958 --> 19:23.958
It's the setting of my favorite novel,
Anna Karenina.

19:24.041 --> 19:25.416
I haven't read it.

19:25.500 --> 19:26.833
Oh, you must!

19:26.916 --> 19:28.750
-It's literature's most tragic love story.

19:28.833 --> 19:32.083
And the most true, because all
love stories are tragic, aren't they?

19:32.166 --> 19:34.291
I hope not.

19:35.791 --> 19:37.208
PATRICK:
Let's have a toast.

19:38.375 --> 19:40.708
-To Marion.
-No.

19:40.791 --> 19:42.041
To all of us.

19:42.125 --> 19:43.250
-To all of us.
-To all of us.

19:43.333 --> 19:45.375
-All of us.
-Cheers. Cheers!

20:41.625 --> 20:42.791
Pamela can't make it.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.000
I'm giving you your bath.

20:45.083 --> 20:47.916
She doesn't come again before Friday.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.041
You need a bath.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.708
Believe me,

20:51.791 --> 20:55.291
I'm not any happier about it than you are.

20:55.375 --> 20:58.708
You'll get one of these after,
if you behave.

21:28.958 --> 21:30.750
Rather beautiful dome shape above,

21:30.833 --> 21:33.125
which is very typical
of Indian architecture.

21:34.625 --> 21:36.250
Peaceful, isn't it?

21:38.125 --> 21:40.916
It was built to commemorate
the many brave Indian soldiers

21:41.000 --> 21:42.250
during the Great War.

21:45.250 --> 21:48.250
It's made entirely of Italian marble.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.708
Shipped over from Sicily.

22:29.375 --> 22:31.375
Do you mind if I join you?

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
MARION:
We went to the opera.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.041
Verdi.

23:43.125 --> 23:45.083
It was beautiful.

23:45.166 --> 23:47.000
JULIA:
And you were Patrick's guests again?

23:48.458 --> 23:52.500
Well, he heard that
I'd always dreamed of going,

23:52.583 --> 23:54.583
so he insisted.

23:56.583 --> 23:57.708
What?

23:59.250 --> 24:01.041
How long have you and Tom
known each other?

24:01.125 --> 24:03.250
Since the summer.

24:03.333 --> 24:05.000
Hmm.

24:05.083 --> 24:07.000
And has he made advances?

24:07.083 --> 24:09.083
Tom's a gentleman.

24:09.166 --> 24:10.375
What are you getting at?

24:10.458 --> 24:12.416
Well, it's just...

24:13.791 --> 24:16.666
The three of you
spending so much time together.

24:16.750 --> 24:18.500
Tom's not jealous?

24:18.583 --> 24:20.583
Why should he be?

24:20.666 --> 24:23.291
Well, you and this Patrick seem
better suited to each other.

24:23.375 --> 24:25.625
So many similar interests.

24:25.708 --> 24:28.208
Are you sure it's Tom you want to be with?

24:28.291 --> 24:31.958
Well, I must admit, Patrick is dashing.

24:32.041 --> 24:34.791
-But...
-But?

24:34.875 --> 24:37.666
With Tom, I don't care about

24:37.750 --> 24:41.416
education or grammar or manners.

24:41.500 --> 24:43.500
When he burps when he drinks his beer

24:43.583 --> 24:46.333
or falls asleep
at the opera, which he did.

24:46.416 --> 24:49.791
-And it annoyed Patrick to no end.

24:49.875 --> 24:52.583
With all of that,

24:52.666 --> 24:54.708
he's just perfect.

24:55.750 --> 24:57.291
He's Tom.

24:58.333 --> 25:00.666
Does that answer your question?

25:00.750 --> 25:03.291
Well, I think you're saying
you're in love.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.041
And Tom?

25:10.416 --> 25:12.000
Well, you'll be happy to hear

25:12.083 --> 25:14.333
that we are seeing each other
this weekend.

25:14.416 --> 25:15.625
Just the two of us.

25:18.958 --> 25:20.416
Your idea?

25:20.500 --> 25:21.791
His.

25:30.500 --> 25:33.000
Do you want another?

25:33.083 --> 25:35.250
I've barely touched this one.

25:35.333 --> 25:36.916
Right.

25:39.958 --> 25:41.541
How's Sylvie?

25:42.750 --> 25:44.541
Same.

25:44.625 --> 25:45.875
Are you all right?

25:50.416 --> 25:52.416
Let's go. We can't talk in here.

25:52.500 --> 25:55.833
-Now get out! Get out!

25:58.500 --> 26:00.416
What the hell is wrong with you?

26:00.500 --> 26:03.375
-What? -Why can't we have
a drink like a normal couple?

26:03.458 --> 26:04.958
Or dance?

26:13.458 --> 26:15.916
I want to take you somewhere.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.958
All right?

26:29.250 --> 26:30.708
Can I get you a drink?

26:30.791 --> 26:33.291
-What would you like?

26:33.375 --> 26:35.416
Whiskey?

26:35.500 --> 26:37.166
Cognac?

26:37.250 --> 26:38.750
Brandy?

26:41.000 --> 26:42.583
Is this Patrick's flat?

26:42.666 --> 26:44.083
Yeah.

26:45.333 --> 26:46.833
He's in London.

26:46.916 --> 26:49.291
Gave me a set of keys
so I can use it when he's away.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.875
You said you wanted...?

26:51.958 --> 26:53.875
MARION:
Whiskey, please.

26:56.333 --> 26:58.000
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.958
Is this you?

27:06.041 --> 27:07.500
It's good, isn't it?

27:10.375 --> 27:13.625
Patrick says ordinary people
have the best faces.

27:16.875 --> 27:18.208
Did you pose for this?

27:18.291 --> 27:20.125
That's how Patrick and I met.

27:20.208 --> 27:21.375
I told you.

27:21.458 --> 27:24.375
No, you said it was reporting an accident.

27:26.291 --> 27:29.291
I haven't finished the tour. Come on.

27:52.416 --> 27:54.458
I wanted it to be nice for you.

27:54.541 --> 27:56.541
This is nice.

27:58.083 --> 28:00.083
I wanted to tell you...

28:01.916 --> 28:03.916
...ask you a question, really.

28:05.791 --> 28:07.791
Something that's hard to say.

28:07.875 --> 28:09.416
Just try.

28:13.583 --> 28:15.458
I want you to be my wife.

28:19.625 --> 28:20.958
I-I'm not good at this sort of thing.

28:21.041 --> 28:22.583
I wasn't sure you even...

28:22.666 --> 28:27.000
I never tried anything before
because I think I was afraid.

28:27.083 --> 28:29.166
Of me?

28:29.250 --> 28:31.625
Of growing up.

28:31.708 --> 28:33.750
When a man gets married, it's a big step.

28:35.041 --> 28:37.916
And you seemed so taken with Patrick, I...

28:38.000 --> 28:40.708
No, that's not true, Tom.
That's not true at all.

28:40.791 --> 28:42.791
I just...

28:42.875 --> 28:46.708
I didn't think you were
interested in me. That's all.

28:47.791 --> 28:49.250
We're just two confused people, aren't we?

28:50.416 --> 28:52.291
Looks that way.

28:55.625 --> 28:57.208
Will you think about it?

29:00.625 --> 29:02.125
MARION:
Very lucky.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.875
I'm on a roll.

29:18.416 --> 29:20.000
It's time for his pills.

29:28.833 --> 29:30.916
He spoke today.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.708
Do you want to know what he said?

29:32.791 --> 29:34.166
Not particularly.

29:35.208 --> 29:37.125
"Where's Tom?"

29:40.166 --> 29:42.291
That's what he asked.

29:42.375 --> 29:43.791
Christ Almighty, Marion.

29:43.875 --> 29:45.041
What do you want from me?

29:45.125 --> 29:48.291
All the time he's been here,
you haven't been to see him once.

29:48.375 --> 29:49.750
And I don't plan to.

29:49.833 --> 29:53.083
If he upsets you so much,
you should just send him away.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.458
-You don't mean that.
-I do.

29:54.541 --> 29:56.041
I said it from the beginning.

29:56.125 --> 29:57.833
We owe him something after what happened.

29:57.916 --> 29:59.875
Just leave it alone.
We settled it a long time ago.

29:59.958 --> 30:01.166
No. We didn't.

30:01.250 --> 30:02.708
We didn't settle it.

30:02.791 --> 30:04.125
We just stopped talking about it.

30:04.208 --> 30:05.916
I don't want to hear another word.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.041
-Are we playing or not?

30:09.125 --> 30:10.416
How did this happen?!

30:10.500 --> 30:12.416
:
Bloody hell.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.916
I was supposed to be married with
all the good things that come with that.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.416
Now look-look at me.

30:17.500 --> 30:19.333
There's no passion.

30:20.875 --> 30:24.750
Everything was fine
until you brought him here.

30:24.833 --> 30:27.208
Things haven't been fine
for quite a while,

30:27.291 --> 30:29.500
and if we don't try
to fix it or at least--

30:29.583 --> 30:30.916
Wh-Where are you going?

30:31.000 --> 30:33.666
-The pub for some peace.
-And-and what do I do, Tom?

30:33.750 --> 30:35.500
How do I find some peace?

30:35.583 --> 30:36.750
-Send him away.
-No!

30:36.833 --> 30:39.541
You want him gone, you do it.

31:55.291 --> 31:58.375
PATRICK:
29th of July, 1957.

32:02.208 --> 32:03.708
-Yes?
-There's been an accident.

32:03.791 --> 32:06.208
An old lady on her bicycle.
Could you come quickly, please?

32:10.333 --> 32:12.041
PATRICK:
Finding a policeman

32:12.125 --> 32:14.958
was not something I ever thought
I would have to do.

32:16.416 --> 32:18.500
PATRICK:
What the devil?

32:18.583 --> 32:20.541
She didn't want to wait for you.

32:20.625 --> 32:23.500
-Says she hates bloody coppers.

32:24.916 --> 32:27.958
Not the first time I've heard that.

32:28.041 --> 32:30.041
Not much of an accident, was it?

32:31.208 --> 32:32.875
I'm terribly sorry to have bothered you.

32:32.958 --> 32:34.666
Oh, no bother at all, sir.

32:34.750 --> 32:36.541
You did the right thing.

32:36.625 --> 32:39.291
Besides, you never know
how these things will turn out.

32:39.375 --> 32:41.833
Thank you. Mister...?

32:41.916 --> 32:43.250
Hazelwood.

32:43.333 --> 32:44.458
Officer Burgess.

32:44.541 --> 32:47.333
Let me give you my card.

32:48.583 --> 32:50.250
PATRICK:
I've never had much patience

32:50.333 --> 32:51.916
with our boys in blue.

32:53.250 --> 32:56.833
I've always despised
their brutish little ways.

32:56.916 --> 32:59.041
The evaluating glance up and down.

32:59.125 --> 33:02.125
The distaste they cannot hide.

33:03.875 --> 33:06.500
But this boy is different.

33:08.333 --> 33:10.041
His eyes lit up when he saw my card.

33:10.125 --> 33:11.458
You work at the museum?

33:11.541 --> 33:14.625
Said he'd never been
to Brighton's most noble institution,

33:14.708 --> 33:16.625
even on a school trip.

33:16.708 --> 33:18.041
I had the measles.

33:18.125 --> 33:20.250
-Oh, dear.

33:20.333 --> 33:23.000
I invited him
to visit the museum as my guest.

33:23.083 --> 33:24.291
You're welcome.

33:24.375 --> 33:26.000
PATRICK:
He seemed interested.

33:28.083 --> 33:30.500
I haven't been able
to stop thinking about him.

33:31.875 --> 33:33.958
He's handsome, yes.

33:34.041 --> 33:35.791
But there's something else.

33:36.875 --> 33:40.625
Innocence combined with a curiosity.

33:42.833 --> 33:47.250
I'd like to draw him,
but I wonder if he'd misunderstand.

33:49.958 --> 33:52.666
I'd almost forgotten that
some people are still innocent.

33:52.750 --> 33:54.833
-Mr. Hazelwood.
-Mm-hmm.

33:54.916 --> 33:57.291
An officer's here asking for you.

33:59.583 --> 34:02.625
Tell him he'll have to wait.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.250
He's rather handsome for a copper.

34:12.958 --> 34:14.958
PATRICK:
There he was.

34:17.041 --> 34:19.250
I recognized him even from behind.

34:23.083 --> 34:25.125
That fine head.

34:27.208 --> 34:29.916
The unmistakable line of his shoulder.

34:39.625 --> 34:41.625
TOM:
Now, that's a good painting.

34:42.791 --> 34:44.458
PATRICK:
In fact, it's a masterpiece.

34:47.083 --> 34:50.666
See? I must have
some taste for art after all.

34:53.166 --> 34:56.291
Taste is simply just knowing
how something makes you feel.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.416
So how does it make you feel?

35:04.500 --> 35:06.458
You can sense the waves.

35:07.916 --> 35:09.541
You know, how strong they are.

35:09.625 --> 35:11.583
Like swimming in rough surf.

35:13.541 --> 35:15.500
-Exciting.
-Mm.

35:18.375 --> 35:19.958
And frightening.

35:21.041 --> 35:22.250
Right.

35:23.916 --> 35:26.250
Don't tell the boys down the station
I'm afraid of a painting.

35:35.291 --> 35:37.291
You know, I'm an amateur artist.

35:38.666 --> 35:39.791
You paint?

35:39.875 --> 35:42.500
Pencil drawings mostly.

35:42.583 --> 35:44.333
Studies of ordinary Brighton people,

35:44.416 --> 35:47.083
a tram conductor, a barman,
that sort of thing.

35:49.583 --> 35:51.333
You'd make a perfect subject.

35:51.416 --> 35:52.916
Me?

35:54.291 --> 35:56.000
Never been asked to model before.

35:56.083 --> 35:58.083
Oh, there's nothing to it.

36:01.875 --> 36:04.625
But I wouldn't mind
learning more about paintings.

36:06.083 --> 36:07.666
Art, I mean.

36:08.708 --> 36:10.958
Well, that's admirable.

36:11.041 --> 36:13.000
Is it? Why?

36:14.416 --> 36:17.750
Because a man should always
try to improve himself.

37:33.500 --> 37:34.916
-I made it.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.416
RUDY:
Evening, Patrick.

37:36.500 --> 37:37.833
Rudy.

37:37.916 --> 37:40.333
This is Tom, my cousin.

37:40.416 --> 37:41.958
How do you do?

37:42.041 --> 37:43.625
Fine, thank you.

37:49.750 --> 37:51.375
Cousin?

37:51.458 --> 37:53.250
I assumed you didn't want me to say that

37:53.333 --> 37:55.958
you're a police officer coming
to have your portrait drawn.

37:57.708 --> 37:59.583
Nothing wrong with that, is there?

38:07.541 --> 38:09.666
-Nice place.
-Thank you.

38:11.208 --> 38:12.583
I brought my uniform,

38:12.666 --> 38:14.666
in case you want me in it
for the portrait.

38:14.750 --> 38:17.000
Yes, yes. That will do nicely.

38:21.041 --> 38:24.916
Well, then, why don't, uh... you change.

39:03.208 --> 39:05.083
Do you like being a policeman?

39:06.875 --> 39:08.791
-Yeah, I think so.
-Try to keep the pose.

39:08.875 --> 39:09.916
Oh. Sorry.

39:11.458 --> 39:13.458
I think so.

39:13.541 --> 39:15.333
What do you like about it?

39:17.166 --> 39:19.083
Is this part of the procedure?

39:20.125 --> 39:22.458
I can't draw you
if I don't know who you are.

39:22.541 --> 39:23.791
Right.

39:26.333 --> 39:27.583
Um...

39:29.416 --> 39:32.750
I like knowing I'm doing
something for the public.

39:32.833 --> 39:34.541
You know, protecting people.

39:37.916 --> 39:40.041
If that's your ambition,
I give you more credit

39:40.125 --> 39:41.625
than most of your colleagues.

39:42.875 --> 39:44.041
How so?

39:46.500 --> 39:48.333
You seem more...

39:49.708 --> 39:53.333
...open-minded than
the police I've run across.

39:54.666 --> 39:57.000
-Do I?
-Oh, yes.

39:57.083 --> 40:00.208
I tend to keep my distance
from the police in general.

40:00.291 --> 40:04.000
There's no reason to fear a police officer
if you stay on the right side of the law.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.125
Of course. I-I...

40:06.208 --> 40:08.000
It's the criminal element
that causes the trouble.

40:08.083 --> 40:10.333
We just have to deal with it.

40:10.416 --> 40:11.708
I don't know if this is a good...

40:11.791 --> 40:14.000
I haven't offered you a drink.
Would you like something?

40:15.750 --> 40:17.500
Um...

40:17.583 --> 40:20.166
Please, beer if you've got it.

40:20.250 --> 40:23.208
Don't have any beer. Uh...

40:23.291 --> 40:24.416
How about something stronger?

40:24.500 --> 40:27.416
I'm going to have a Scotch.

40:28.666 --> 40:31.833
How about you, Officer Burgess?

40:33.375 --> 40:35.916
Scotch. Thank you.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.833
And it's Tom.

40:40.791 --> 40:42.166
Tom.

40:46.708 --> 40:50.125
Oi! Stop where you are,
you bloody hooligan.

40:50.208 --> 40:51.750
What? What? Am I that ridiculous?

40:51.833 --> 40:53.291
I'm sorry, but "hooligan"?

40:55.291 --> 40:56.708
All right.

40:56.791 --> 40:59.500
-I'm no, I'm no bobby. Mm.

40:59.583 --> 41:02.291
-Well, this-this looks better
on you anyway. -Mm.

41:03.666 --> 41:07.416
-And the material's coarse.
-Yeah, like me.

41:07.500 --> 41:09.541
No, not at all like you.

41:24.708 --> 41:27.000
Do I make a good subject, then?

41:29.041 --> 41:32.291
Despite your nervousness...

41:32.375 --> 41:34.375
-yes, yes.

41:35.458 --> 41:37.166
Well, the Scotch helped.

41:37.250 --> 41:38.583
Don't know if I needed
three of them, though.

41:38.666 --> 41:40.791
You must think I'm a drunkard.

41:40.875 --> 41:44.666
Oh, why shouldn't a police officer
enjoy himself when he's off duty?

41:44.750 --> 41:47.083
-Absolutely right.
-Mm-hmm.

41:52.375 --> 41:53.875
-Are you really

41:53.958 --> 41:55.708
going to hang my portrait in the museum?

41:59.000 --> 42:00.875
Well...

42:00.958 --> 42:03.875
someday...

42:03.958 --> 42:06.500
I hope to mount a show.

42:10.750 --> 42:12.708
-Imagine.

42:12.791 --> 42:14.750
My face in a museum.

42:16.750 --> 42:19.166
Really think it'll be good enough?

42:20.208 --> 42:22.166
I think it will be...

42:32.416 --> 42:33.875
...lovely.

42:47.416 --> 42:48.541
Sorry.

42:49.583 --> 42:51.291
There's no need to be.

43:08.625 --> 43:11.458
I don't know what's happening.

43:20.166 --> 43:22.791
-Patrick, I'm not...
-Don't say anything.

43:34.416 --> 43:36.625
-Maybe we shouldn't.

43:59.750 --> 44:01.041
:
All right?

45:01.458 --> 45:03.208
Tom?

45:03.291 --> 45:05.416
Will you check the door,
make sure there's nobody there?

45:18.041 --> 45:19.666
There's no one there.

45:21.666 --> 45:23.916
How do you do it?

45:24.000 --> 45:25.458
Do what?

45:27.708 --> 45:29.333
Live this life.

45:32.083 --> 45:34.208
One learns to live as one can.

45:35.375 --> 45:36.750
I can't.

45:52.333 --> 45:54.291
PATRICK:
It's hell being alone.

45:56.708 --> 45:59.666
I don't know whether I'll ever
see my policeman again.

46:01.916 --> 46:04.750
These are wretched times we live in.

46:07.666 --> 46:10.291
When one has to scurry underground
like a criminal...

46:12.458 --> 46:14.458
...just to drown one's sorrows.

46:16.666 --> 46:20.458
Thankfully, that's why places
like the Argyle exist.

46:35.791 --> 46:37.250
Hello, Patrick.

46:37.333 --> 46:39.291
How are we this evening?

46:39.375 --> 46:41.708
Oh, tolerable, Miss Brown.

46:41.791 --> 46:43.500
Oh, like myself.

46:43.583 --> 46:45.000
Scotch as usual?

46:52.750 --> 46:54.583
What are you having?

47:05.958 --> 47:07.875
A dry martini.

47:07.958 --> 47:10.750
Dry martinis, please.

47:10.833 --> 47:12.583
For each of us.

47:31.291 --> 47:33.166
-Oi!

47:33.250 --> 47:34.375
-Stop right there!

47:34.458 --> 47:36.666
-Stop there!

47:36.750 --> 47:38.416
Fucking queers.

47:46.333 --> 47:48.333
How disgusting.

47:48.416 --> 47:50.000
Get up.

47:51.041 --> 47:52.541
You're under arrest.

48:23.458 --> 48:25.458
:
I don't know why...

48:52.541 --> 48:54.541
You still want to draw me?

48:56.666 --> 48:58.250
If you like.

49:00.208 --> 49:02.083
:
If I like?

49:04.750 --> 49:06.625
I thought that's what you wanted.

49:08.416 --> 49:11.625
To draw my portrait, an ordinary person.

49:15.458 --> 49:17.333
That's not what you wanted, is it?

49:17.416 --> 49:18.833
You're drunk.

49:18.916 --> 49:20.791
You got me here under false pretenses.

49:20.875 --> 49:22.333
You knew what you wanted the whole time!

49:22.416 --> 49:24.666
That's why you asked me here, isn't it?!

49:27.958 --> 49:30.791
-Answer me!
-Hit me! Hit me! Go on.

49:37.541 --> 49:39.041
You shouldn't have dragged me into it.

49:39.125 --> 49:40.875
You touched me first.

49:45.333 --> 49:48.000
I shouldn't have done that. It was wrong.

49:55.500 --> 49:57.041
:
Did it feel wrong?

50:00.208 --> 50:01.958
Please...

50:04.875 --> 50:06.291
...don't.

52:31.375 --> 52:33.541
Did you ever think about getting married?

52:37.166 --> 52:38.833
I had a lover.

52:40.833 --> 52:42.166
Michael.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.083
And we were together five years.

52:50.333 --> 52:51.916
What happened?

52:57.250 --> 52:59.541
A gang of thugs beat him to death.

53:02.291 --> 53:03.833
:
Bloody hell.

53:08.083 --> 53:10.041
How do you stand being alone?

53:16.000 --> 53:18.083
I'm not alone, am I?

53:27.583 --> 53:29.375
We have to be careful.

55:41.125 --> 55:43.958
What? There's... no one for miles.

55:46.750 --> 55:48.500
You can afford to break the rules.

55:48.583 --> 55:50.208
I can't.

56:08.250 --> 56:11.250
For a policeman, that's very romantic.

56:15.333 --> 56:17.125
I better tell you.

56:18.583 --> 56:20.708
I'm planning on getting married.

56:25.416 --> 56:26.750
I see.

56:28.291 --> 56:30.958
-A man ought to be married.
-Well, not all men.

56:33.333 --> 56:36.166
The other day, I was called in
to see the sergeant.

56:36.250 --> 56:38.916
He told me I was doing well.

56:39.000 --> 56:43.041
And then he said, "I should warn you,

56:43.125 --> 56:46.708
some bachelors have found it hard
to rise through this division."

56:50.416 --> 56:53.166
Do you think that's fair?

56:53.250 --> 56:55.958
To the girl, I mean.

56:56.041 --> 56:59.125
-What?
-Well, marrying her for...

56:59.208 --> 57:01.583
well, I call it for protection.

57:01.666 --> 57:04.291
That's not the only reason.

57:04.375 --> 57:06.583
I'm fond of her.

57:06.666 --> 57:08.875
And someday I hope to have children.

57:17.750 --> 57:19.208
No.

57:23.541 --> 57:25.916
Are you saying goodbye to me?

57:26.000 --> 57:28.041
No. I don't...

57:28.125 --> 57:29.791
-Do you want me to stop?

57:29.875 --> 57:31.541
No.

57:31.625 --> 57:33.083
Then what shall we do?

57:34.208 --> 57:36.166
Can you share me?

57:39.083 --> 57:40.875
If that's what it takes.

57:56.041 --> 57:57.500
Bobby.

57:57.583 --> 57:59.125
Here you go, boy.

58:13.250 --> 58:14.750
Good boy.

58:52.458 --> 58:53.500
JULIA:
It was a sweet ceremony.

58:53.583 --> 58:55.041
-Just perfect.
-Really?

58:56.291 --> 58:59.125
And the two of you are
the handsomest couple I've ever seen.

59:00.375 --> 59:02.416
Patrick bought Tom that suit.

59:02.500 --> 59:04.208
I don't think we'll ever
see him in it again.

59:04.291 --> 59:06.375
He thinks he looks silly.

59:10.708 --> 59:12.541
-I couldn't be happier for you.
-Thank you.

59:12.625 --> 59:14.625
-Oh.

59:14.708 --> 59:19.458
Apparently, I've been drafted
to make a toast.

59:19.541 --> 59:20.958
So where's our lovely bride?

59:26.000 --> 59:29.541
Now, here is to Tom and Marion,

59:29.625 --> 59:31.750
the perfect civilized couple.

59:31.833 --> 59:34.791
Mr. and Mrs. Burgess.

59:35.791 --> 59:37.875
CROWD:
Mr. and Mrs. Burgess!

59:37.958 --> 59:40.166
Uh, Tom, I think
you're meant to kiss the bride.

1:00:18.791 --> 1:00:20.250
You look nice.

1:00:20.333 --> 1:00:22.375
Thank you.

1:00:53.708 --> 1:00:56.000
Should we turn the light out?

1:00:56.083 --> 1:00:58.166
Yeah.

1:01:57.958 --> 1:01:59.750
I'm sorry.

1:02:33.166 --> 1:02:34.541
Was it all right?

1:02:34.625 --> 1:02:36.333
:
Yes, Tom.

1:02:39.416 --> 1:02:41.041
I'll be better next time.

1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:44.583
It was lovely.

1:03:03.916 --> 1:03:06.125
I've got a present for you.

1:03:06.208 --> 1:03:07.708
What?

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:13.458
-Oh, my God! Tom!

1:03:15.541 --> 1:03:16.958
-Oh.
-Oh.

1:03:21.333 --> 1:03:22.583
You should've seen your face.

1:03:36.166 --> 1:03:37.708
Hello.

1:03:37.791 --> 1:03:39.291
Here I am, just as promised.

1:03:39.375 --> 1:03:41.083
Tom, help me with all of this, would you?

1:03:41.166 --> 1:03:42.458
Patrick?

1:03:42.541 --> 1:03:46.416
I promised to cook you
a fabulous wedding feast.

1:03:48.166 --> 1:03:50.250
Didn't Tom tell you?

1:03:50.333 --> 1:03:51.625
No.

1:03:51.708 --> 1:03:53.208
TOM:
I'm sure I did.

1:03:53.291 --> 1:03:55.083
PATRICK:
Just for tonight.

1:03:55.166 --> 1:03:57.208
Then I'll be out of your hair.

1:03:59.708 --> 1:04:01.083
You look so happy, my dear.

1:04:02.708 --> 1:04:04.250
I am.

1:04:33.541 --> 1:04:36.625
Patrick's a terrific cook, isn't he?

1:04:36.708 --> 1:04:37.875
I'm quite impressed.

1:04:37.958 --> 1:04:39.500
-Beef bourguignon.
-I'll give you the recipe.

1:04:39.583 --> 1:04:41.708
You can have it waiting on the table
for Tom when he gets home

1:04:41.791 --> 1:04:43.875
-from a hard day of putting
the cuffs on criminals. -Mm.

1:04:43.958 --> 1:04:45.000
I'll drink to that.

1:04:46.458 --> 1:04:48.666
I don't think I'll ever manage
anything as fancy.

1:04:48.750 --> 1:04:50.458
Rubbish. You're a good cook.

1:04:50.541 --> 1:04:52.416
-And with Patrick's help,

1:04:52.500 --> 1:04:54.291
-you'll become a gourmet, I'm sure of it.

1:04:54.375 --> 1:04:57.708
Yes, but between lesson plans
and staff meetings,

1:04:57.791 --> 1:04:59.541
I'll barely be home before you get there.

1:04:59.625 --> 1:05:01.791
I don't like the sound of that.

1:05:01.875 --> 1:05:03.708
-You plan to keep teaching, then?

1:05:03.791 --> 1:05:04.791
I hope to.

1:05:04.875 --> 1:05:06.250
Oh, good for you.

1:05:06.333 --> 1:05:08.166
If you enjoy your career,
why should you give it up?

1:05:08.250 --> 1:05:10.416
I'll tell you why.

1:05:10.500 --> 1:05:13.458
A mother ought to be at home
with her children.

1:05:13.541 --> 1:05:14.875
Tom, it's 1958.

1:05:14.958 --> 1:05:17.333
-Educated women like Marion have careers.

1:05:19.416 --> 1:05:21.541
I'm surprised you're being
so suburban about it.

1:05:21.625 --> 1:05:23.625
What would you know about it?

1:05:25.125 --> 1:05:27.166
-I... -You know nothing about
children or being a parent

1:05:27.250 --> 1:05:32.041
or being married, so stop telling me
what I'm supposed to think about it!

1:05:38.833 --> 1:05:40.625
Stop being such a...

1:05:47.250 --> 1:05:48.791
Sorry.

1:06:04.166 --> 1:06:07.208
Well, I've really gone
and blown it, haven't I?

1:06:07.291 --> 1:06:09.833
Oh, we, um, we ganged up on him.

1:06:09.916 --> 1:06:11.333
I was on your side.

1:06:11.416 --> 1:06:14.708
Tom and I are married now.

1:06:14.791 --> 1:06:17.416
We have to sort
these things out on our own.

1:07:57.500 --> 1:07:59.083
TOM :
Sorry.

1:07:59.166 --> 1:08:01.416
I had too much to drink.

1:08:01.500 --> 1:08:02.875
I don't know what happened.

1:08:02.958 --> 1:08:04.541
PATRICK :
It's all right.

1:08:07.166 --> 1:08:10.166
-Listen, perhaps I should go.
-You're probably right.

1:08:56.208 --> 1:08:57.708
TOM:
You have your things?

1:08:57.791 --> 1:08:59.583
PATRICK:
In the car.

1:08:59.666 --> 1:09:01.250
Thanks again for everything.

1:09:01.333 --> 1:09:03.125
PATRICK:
You're welcome.

1:09:03.208 --> 1:09:04.583
Give my love to Marion.

1:09:04.666 --> 1:09:06.291
TOM:
Will do.

1:09:30.625 --> 1:09:32.541
Patrick's off.

1:09:32.625 --> 1:09:34.250
He said to say goodbye.

1:09:34.333 --> 1:09:37.583
Do you know what I think, Mrs. Burgess?

1:09:37.666 --> 1:09:40.208
I'm going to make you breakfast
for a change.

1:09:40.291 --> 1:09:42.000
Would you like that?

1:09:44.875 --> 1:09:46.250
Marion?

1:09:49.291 --> 1:09:50.791
What's wrong?

1:09:52.291 --> 1:09:54.250
I know the place is a mess,
but I'll clean it up.

1:09:54.333 --> 1:09:55.583
You won't have to do a thing.

1:09:58.875 --> 1:10:00.458
I want to go upstairs with you.

1:10:00.541 --> 1:10:02.375
:
All right.

1:10:55.333 --> 1:10:57.583
It's beautiful.

1:10:57.666 --> 1:10:59.416
Don't you think?

1:11:04.208 --> 1:11:05.666
Patrick.

1:11:05.750 --> 1:11:08.125
You haven't been eating.

1:11:09.416 --> 1:11:11.083
I'm worried.

1:11:14.625 --> 1:11:17.208
Is there something I can do for you?

1:11:20.916 --> 1:11:22.666
Would you rather be in a home?

1:11:22.750 --> 1:11:27.000
They're-they're awful,
but if you're unhappy here.

1:11:29.708 --> 1:11:32.416
Do you want to go back?

1:11:32.500 --> 1:11:34.833
Thank you.

1:11:34.916 --> 1:11:36.458
All right.

1:12:06.458 --> 1:12:10.208
PATRICK:
25th of May, 1958.

1:12:10.291 --> 1:12:14.416
Now they're married,
I can feel him slipping away.

1:12:23.791 --> 1:12:25.125
Tom.

1:12:27.125 --> 1:12:28.833
Don't ruin it.

1:12:30.125 --> 1:12:31.791
How would I do that?

1:12:33.333 --> 1:12:34.958
Asking about next time.

1:12:39.583 --> 1:12:42.500
Do you know how long it's been
since we saw each other last?

1:12:42.583 --> 1:12:44.833
How many days?

1:12:44.916 --> 1:12:46.583
I better go.

1:12:47.958 --> 1:12:51.166
Please, please, just...
just a few more minutes.

1:12:51.250 --> 1:12:53.916
Marion expects me home after my shift.

1:12:55.750 --> 1:12:57.000
One more minute.

1:12:57.083 --> 1:12:58.708
She wants to have a baby.

1:13:06.083 --> 1:13:07.875
You'll make a wonderful father.

1:13:11.458 --> 1:13:13.000
I have something for you.

1:13:22.750 --> 1:13:24.208
A present.

1:13:28.083 --> 1:13:29.500
TOM:
Guide to Venice.

1:13:29.583 --> 1:13:32.458
I'm going next month on museum business.

1:13:34.625 --> 1:13:36.250
Why don't you come with me?

1:13:37.375 --> 1:13:38.958
To Venice?

1:13:39.041 --> 1:13:40.791
Just you and I.

1:13:42.541 --> 1:13:45.208
No checking the time and rushing off.

1:13:47.166 --> 1:13:48.791
No hiding.

1:13:50.083 --> 1:13:51.916
No lies.

1:13:53.916 --> 1:13:55.791
-Wouldn't you enjoy that?
-Patrick, I'm married.

1:13:55.875 --> 1:13:58.625
Yeah, but even a married man has
the right to travel, doesn't he?

1:13:58.708 --> 1:14:01.416
I mean, some men go on fishing trips
with their friends.

1:14:01.500 --> 1:14:03.833
Yeah, a man ought to take his wife
on a holiday

1:14:03.916 --> 1:14:05.250
before he goes off with a mate.

1:14:05.333 --> 1:14:07.333
No, but this isn't a holiday.

1:14:07.416 --> 1:14:11.375
The museum is paying for an assistant,

1:14:11.458 --> 1:14:15.083
and I'm offering the position to you.

1:14:17.291 --> 1:14:18.583
A real position?

1:14:18.666 --> 1:14:20.625
It pays 35 pounds.

1:14:20.708 --> 1:14:23.250
-That's almost what I make in a month.
-Good.

1:14:23.333 --> 1:14:26.375
Well, I'll book us a suite
in one of my favorite hotels.

1:14:28.083 --> 1:14:30.083
And what would I tell Marion?

1:14:31.166 --> 1:14:32.833
-Patrick, I can't.
-Then I'll do it.

1:14:32.916 --> 1:14:33.875
I'll tell her.

1:14:39.958 --> 1:14:42.125
You mustn't hurt her, Patrick.

1:14:44.291 --> 1:14:47.000
She really is a wonderful person.

1:14:50.375 --> 1:14:52.416
-Follow me, please.

1:14:54.458 --> 1:14:56.041
PATRICK:
Dance, go to the picture house,

1:14:56.125 --> 1:14:58.416
or you can watch Punch and Judy
on the pier.

1:14:58.500 --> 1:15:00.625
And that is art-- music inspires us

1:15:00.708 --> 1:15:03.875
just like every single painting
in this gallery.

1:15:03.958 --> 1:15:05.250
Right. Did you enjoy yourselves?

1:15:05.333 --> 1:15:06.416
KIDS:
Yes.

1:15:06.500 --> 1:15:07.583
Yes? Good, good.

1:15:07.666 --> 1:15:10.458
Now, Miss Stewart here

1:15:10.541 --> 1:15:13.000
will give each of you
a lollipop, all right?

1:15:13.083 --> 1:15:15.458
Goodbye, now.

1:15:15.541 --> 1:15:17.708
Oh, it's been such a delightful day.

1:15:17.791 --> 1:15:19.250
The children have
thoroughly enjoyed themselves.

1:15:19.333 --> 1:15:20.583
I better get them back to school.

1:15:23.250 --> 1:15:26.750
Oh, I, uh... plan to put Tom
to work, you know.

1:15:26.833 --> 1:15:28.000
On what?

1:15:28.083 --> 1:15:29.625
Yes, the assistant curator couldn't go.

1:15:29.708 --> 1:15:31.541
I almost had to cancel
before Tom stepped in

1:15:31.625 --> 1:15:34.000
at the last minute and saved my neck.

1:15:34.083 --> 1:15:35.875
-I'm sorry, I-I don't...
-Our trip to Venice.

1:15:38.416 --> 1:15:41.500
Tom's gonna be my assistant
while I pick up some new pieces.

1:15:41.583 --> 1:15:44.375
There'll be so much to pack up
and cart to the station.

1:15:44.458 --> 1:15:46.250
He'll do a splendid job.

1:15:46.333 --> 1:15:49.416
And I've seen to it that he'll be
handsomely compensated.

1:15:51.208 --> 1:15:53.583
Hasn't he mentioned it?

1:15:53.666 --> 1:15:55.083
Of course.

1:15:56.208 --> 1:15:58.583
Well, thanks for being a sport about it.

1:15:58.666 --> 1:16:00.000
Certainly.

1:16:01.166 --> 1:16:02.208
Come on, children!

1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:04.083
Marion?

1:17:04.166 --> 1:17:05.875
You're going to Venice.

1:17:05.958 --> 1:17:07.375
With Patrick.

1:17:09.833 --> 1:17:12.166
I hadn't decided.

1:17:12.250 --> 1:17:13.958
Why shouldn't I go?

1:17:14.041 --> 1:17:15.916
Patrick is a sexual pervert.

1:17:18.041 --> 1:17:19.000
That's ridiculous.

1:17:19.083 --> 1:17:21.458
It's obvious, Tom.

1:17:21.541 --> 1:17:23.291
To everyone but you.

1:17:23.375 --> 1:17:24.666
You're wrong!

1:17:24.750 --> 1:17:26.291
You want to see perverts?

1:17:26.375 --> 1:17:28.916
Come down to the station,
and I will show you some.

1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:31.541
They wear stuff on their faces,
rouge and that and jewelry.

1:17:31.625 --> 1:17:33.916
It's pathetic!

1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:35.458
And they have this walk.

1:17:35.541 --> 1:17:38.458
-You can see them a mile off.
-All right, all right.

1:17:38.541 --> 1:17:40.000
I get the picture.

1:17:40.083 --> 1:17:42.000
He has business in Venice.

1:17:42.083 --> 1:17:43.583
I'm being paid.

1:17:43.666 --> 1:17:46.541
He's trying to destroy our marriage.

1:17:46.625 --> 1:17:47.750
You know what, Marion?

1:17:47.833 --> 1:17:49.458
I'm beginning to think
you've got a dirty mind.

1:17:49.541 --> 1:17:51.750
I don't know what to do.

1:17:51.833 --> 1:17:55.750
-I have to do something.
-I'll tell you what we're going to do.

1:17:55.833 --> 1:17:58.250
We'll say no more about it.

1:17:59.875 --> 1:18:01.791
I'm going in the other room.

1:18:01.875 --> 1:18:04.375
I want you to pull yourself together.

1:18:04.458 --> 1:18:07.166
We'll have our tea and forget this.

1:18:07.250 --> 1:18:09.041
Marion.

1:18:09.125 --> 1:18:11.125
Get a grip on yourself.

1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:19.750
PATRICK:
This love is all-consuming.

1:18:20.833 --> 1:18:24.666
I pity people who don't know
what it feels like to be this in love.

1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:35.916
JULIA:
You've been distracted all week.

1:20:37.166 --> 1:20:38.750
Something's wrong.

1:20:38.833 --> 1:20:40.833
You ought to talk about it.

1:20:44.208 --> 1:20:46.166
Tom's away.

1:20:46.250 --> 1:20:47.625
Away?

1:20:48.791 --> 1:20:51.166
He's...

1:20:51.250 --> 1:20:52.833
with Patrick.

1:20:53.958 --> 1:20:55.541
They're in Venice.

1:20:55.625 --> 1:20:57.625
Collecting pieces for the museum.

1:21:07.250 --> 1:21:09.250
Patrick is a homosexual.

1:21:10.375 --> 1:21:13.708
You have to be careful saying such things.

1:21:13.791 --> 1:21:16.291
He's in Venice with my husband.

1:21:16.375 --> 1:21:17.833
And Tom?

1:21:19.125 --> 1:21:22.291
I think he, uh... has...

1:21:22.375 --> 1:21:26.458
tendencies that Patrick encourages.

1:21:30.666 --> 1:21:33.250
What am I going to do?

1:21:33.333 --> 1:21:35.083
Do?

1:21:35.166 --> 1:21:36.875
I have to help him.

1:21:36.958 --> 1:21:38.333
I'm-I'm his wife.

1:21:38.416 --> 1:21:40.416
-Help him...?
-Change.

1:21:40.500 --> 1:21:42.750
He has to.

1:21:42.833 --> 1:21:44.583
Marion, listen to me.

1:21:44.666 --> 1:21:49.291
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but it's the kindest thing I can do.

1:21:49.375 --> 1:21:51.375
He won't change.

1:21:52.375 --> 1:21:55.125
And it'll be better for both of you
if you accept that.

1:21:55.208 --> 1:21:56.875
He has to give this up!

1:21:56.958 --> 1:21:59.000
He can't.

1:21:59.083 --> 1:22:00.750
Stop saying that!

1:22:01.958 --> 1:22:04.125
He-he will change.

1:22:04.208 --> 1:22:05.458
W-With my help.

1:22:06.583 --> 1:22:08.208
It's just not true.

1:22:08.291 --> 1:22:09.875
When I...

1:22:09.958 --> 1:22:12.083
think of them together,
it makes my stomach turn.

1:22:12.166 --> 1:22:14.166
It's disgusting. It's wrong.

1:22:19.750 --> 1:22:22.708
Well, if that's the case,
then I'm wrong, too.

1:22:24.166 --> 1:22:25.958
What have you got to do with it?

1:22:28.750 --> 1:22:30.500
Good grief. Did you not know?

1:22:32.416 --> 1:22:35.083
If you could see the look on your face.

1:22:39.750 --> 1:22:40.791
You're...?

1:22:40.875 --> 1:22:42.916
I have someone in my life.

1:22:44.416 --> 1:22:46.375
That I love.

1:22:46.458 --> 1:22:48.000
As much as you love Tom.

1:22:56.583 --> 1:22:59.458
Five seconds ago, I was one person to you,

1:22:59.541 --> 1:23:03.041
and now I'm something
altogether different.

1:23:04.541 --> 1:23:05.666
What's changed?

1:23:05.750 --> 1:23:07.291
It's unnatural.

1:23:13.208 --> 1:23:16.916
And what about you
and your marriage is natural?

1:23:57.916 --> 1:23:59.708
NIGEL:
Another breath for me.

1:24:11.458 --> 1:24:12.750
Excuse me, Mr. Hazelwood.

1:24:12.833 --> 1:24:14.416
There's a gentleman here to see you.

1:24:14.500 --> 1:24:16.166
A policeman.

1:24:21.583 --> 1:24:23.958
Mr. Hazelwood, could we have a word?

1:24:51.083 --> 1:24:52.833
DETECTIVE INSPECTOR:
This way.

1:25:00.041 --> 1:25:01.500
Rounded up another one.

1:25:10.708 --> 1:25:12.541
Marion!

1:25:12.625 --> 1:25:14.625
-Marion!

1:25:14.708 --> 1:25:16.166
MARION:
Tom?

1:25:16.250 --> 1:25:18.083
-Tom?
-Patrick's been arrested!

1:25:18.166 --> 1:25:20.291
-I was at the station
when they brought him in. -What?

1:25:20.375 --> 1:25:22.458
They just looked right past me
like he didn't even know me.

1:25:22.541 --> 1:25:25.958
-Tom, slow down. Tell me...
-Someone reported him!

1:25:26.041 --> 1:25:27.500
Probably someone from the museum.

1:25:27.583 --> 1:25:29.708
-Oh, my God.
-And they dug up some wretch

1:25:29.791 --> 1:25:32.000
who claimed Patrick had him
in the alleyway behind the Argyle.

1:25:32.083 --> 1:25:33.125
Listen to me.

1:25:33.208 --> 1:25:34.625
W-We can put all this behind us.

1:25:34.708 --> 1:25:36.375
We can start our marriage again.

1:25:36.458 --> 1:25:38.375
Jesus, Marion!
This isn't about our marriage!

1:25:38.458 --> 1:25:40.250
Patrick's going to prison,
and I'm bloody ruined!

1:25:40.333 --> 1:25:42.208
Why you?

1:25:42.291 --> 1:25:44.916
If they know about Patrick,
they might know about...

1:25:48.750 --> 1:25:50.458
So it's true?

1:25:50.541 --> 1:25:52.250
You and Patrick.

1:25:52.333 --> 1:25:53.708
Yes, it's true!

1:25:53.791 --> 1:25:56.458
Now someone will tell.

1:25:56.541 --> 1:25:59.666
They'll find out everything,
and that will be it.

1:25:59.750 --> 1:26:01.750
Then everyone will know what I...

1:26:02.916 --> 1:26:04.500
I'm sorry.

1:26:04.583 --> 1:26:07.000
I know I've let you down. I lied.

1:26:08.541 --> 1:26:10.166
What am I going to do?

1:26:11.416 --> 1:26:13.250
No one will ever know.

1:26:13.333 --> 1:26:14.333
How can they not?

1:26:14.416 --> 1:26:16.583
Because Patrick would never tell them.

1:26:16.666 --> 1:26:19.083
You don't know how the police work.

1:26:20.416 --> 1:26:22.416
Patrick wouldn't do that to you.

1:26:25.583 --> 1:26:27.333
It's all right.

1:26:27.416 --> 1:26:31.125
We'll find a lawyer for Patrick.

1:26:31.208 --> 1:26:32.625
A good one.

1:26:32.708 --> 1:26:35.750
And if I have to, I'll stand up
as a character witness.

1:26:41.750 --> 1:26:43.541
I'm so sorry.

1:26:47.916 --> 1:26:49.333
:
I'm sorry.

1:26:51.083 --> 1:26:52.541
I'm so sorry.

1:26:53.583 --> 1:26:57.625
Mr. Hazelwood gave my class
a tour of the museum.

1:26:57.708 --> 1:26:59.458
DEFENSE COUNSEL:
And during that visit,

1:26:59.541 --> 1:27:02.875
did you have any reason
to believe that Mr. Hazelwood

1:27:02.958 --> 1:27:04.458
was a danger to your pupils

1:27:04.541 --> 1:27:08.791
or in any way
a negative influence on them?

1:27:08.875 --> 1:27:11.083
On the contrary, the children loved him.

1:27:13.625 --> 1:27:16.250
Do you believe that
Mr. Hazelwood is capable

1:27:16.333 --> 1:27:18.750
of performing the acts
with which he stands accused?

1:27:18.833 --> 1:27:21.875
Namely, gross indecency
in a public convenience

1:27:21.958 --> 1:27:23.791
and endangering public morals.

1:27:23.875 --> 1:27:25.291
No.

1:27:25.375 --> 1:27:27.125
I do not.

1:27:27.208 --> 1:27:28.583
Thank you.

1:27:33.750 --> 1:27:35.791
Mrs. Burgess,

1:27:35.875 --> 1:27:38.750
do you know Mr. Hazelwood
in another capacity?

1:27:38.833 --> 1:27:39.916
Other than professional.

1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:41.583
Yes.

1:27:43.166 --> 1:27:44.500
He is a friend.

1:27:45.708 --> 1:27:48.875
A close friend
of your husband's, is he not?

1:27:48.958 --> 1:27:51.750
My husband and I
both consider him a friend.

1:27:51.833 --> 1:27:53.708
But he and your husband
are particularly close.

1:27:53.791 --> 1:27:55.458
Isn't that true?

1:27:55.541 --> 1:27:58.375
So close they recently traveled
to Italy together.

1:27:58.458 --> 1:28:00.250
Patrick had business there.

1:28:00.333 --> 1:28:02.416
Did your husband have business there?

1:28:02.500 --> 1:28:03.708
He was assisting him.

1:28:03.791 --> 1:28:05.500
Assisting?

1:28:05.583 --> 1:28:07.416
Yes.

1:28:08.833 --> 1:28:11.333
Mrs. Burgess, I'd like to read an extract

1:28:11.416 --> 1:28:13.833
from one of Patrick Hazelwood's diaries.

1:28:13.916 --> 1:28:16.458
These were collected in his apartment
when he was arrested.

1:28:16.541 --> 1:28:19.875
Some of it is rather purple, I'm afraid.

1:28:19.958 --> 1:28:24.291
This is from a page dated
31st of July, 1957.

1:28:24.375 --> 1:28:28.416
"I recognized him even from behind.

1:28:28.500 --> 1:28:30.166
"That fine head.

1:28:30.250 --> 1:28:32.833
"The unmistakable line of his shoulder.

1:28:32.916 --> 1:28:37.416
My policeman was magnificently alive
in front of me."

1:28:38.500 --> 1:28:42.541
Mrs. Burgess, who is "my policeman"?

1:28:43.875 --> 1:28:45.333
I have no idea.

1:28:45.416 --> 1:28:48.041
Perhaps another extract
will help you remember.

1:28:48.125 --> 1:28:51.041
This is from a later date.

1:28:52.458 --> 1:28:56.000
"We've been meeting in the afternoons,
if he can get away,

1:28:56.083 --> 1:28:57.666
"or in the evenings,

1:28:57.750 --> 1:29:00.625
"but he hasn't forgotten
the schoolteacher.

1:29:00.708 --> 1:29:03.416
"Yesterday, he brought her to the museum.

1:29:03.500 --> 1:29:05.500
"She's instinctively possessive.

1:29:05.583 --> 1:29:08.333
"She touched his shoulders
at every opportunity.

1:29:08.416 --> 1:29:10.583
"If only she knew that my hands had been

1:29:10.666 --> 1:29:12.833
"on those same shoulders the night before,

1:29:12.916 --> 1:29:15.125
as my policeman and I..."

1:29:17.291 --> 1:29:21.333
I'll stop here, as the next passage
borders on obscenity.

1:29:21.416 --> 1:29:25.333
Mrs. Burgess,
you're a schoolteacher, aren't you?

1:29:26.750 --> 1:29:27.791
MARION:
Yes.

1:29:27.875 --> 1:29:30.208
And what is your husband's occupation?

1:29:33.750 --> 1:29:35.833
Mrs. Burgess?

1:29:35.916 --> 1:29:37.291
:
A policeman.

1:29:37.375 --> 1:29:38.791
Speak up, please.

1:29:41.833 --> 1:29:43.583
A policeman.

1:30:06.833 --> 1:30:09.125
-I'll see you in the car.
-All right.

1:30:13.875 --> 1:30:15.708
-Oh, Mrs. Burgess.
-Oh!

1:30:15.791 --> 1:30:16.916
Hey.

1:31:01.166 --> 1:31:03.750
Did you see Nigel and his friend?

1:31:03.833 --> 1:31:05.500
They live a few streets over.

1:31:08.416 --> 1:31:09.916
What's wrong?

1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:11.750
Nothing.

1:31:11.833 --> 1:31:13.416
I'm fine.

1:31:25.541 --> 1:31:27.666
PATRICK:
I see a psychiatrist...

1:31:28.833 --> 1:31:33.291
...who has generously offered
to help me change.

1:31:36.291 --> 1:31:38.000
Isn't that kind of him?

1:31:41.083 --> 1:31:42.375
What happened to your face?

1:31:42.458 --> 1:31:45.125
This is a prison, Marion.

1:31:46.750 --> 1:31:48.458
My new home.

1:31:48.541 --> 1:31:51.291
For two years, in fact.

1:31:57.291 --> 1:31:58.666
How's the food?

1:31:58.750 --> 1:32:00.583
Oh, for God's sake,
I don't want to talk about the food.

1:32:00.666 --> 1:32:02.416
Tell me about Tom.

1:32:03.833 --> 1:32:06.000
-How is he?
-Um...

1:32:07.125 --> 1:32:09.791
He found a job.

1:32:09.875 --> 1:32:12.000
I've kept my teaching position.

1:32:12.083 --> 1:32:14.875
So, we'll manage.

1:32:14.958 --> 1:32:16.416
Could you ask him to come and see me?

1:32:16.500 --> 1:32:18.583
-I need to see him.
-I-I can't.

1:32:18.666 --> 1:32:21.041
Please, Marion, please. I have to see him.

1:32:21.125 --> 1:32:22.791
GUARD:
No touching.

1:32:28.791 --> 1:32:30.333
I'll ask him.

1:32:31.666 --> 1:32:33.791
But surely you realize he can't come.

1:32:37.208 --> 1:32:38.708
I'm sorry.

1:32:47.708 --> 1:32:49.666
Well, you must be pleased about all this.

1:32:51.250 --> 1:32:52.958
Why on earth would I be pleased?

1:32:54.416 --> 1:32:56.166
You've won.

1:33:00.208 --> 1:33:01.666
Patrick...

1:33:02.875 --> 1:33:04.541
...nobody's won.

1:33:59.666 --> 1:34:02.625
I wish you hadn't done that.

1:34:02.708 --> 1:34:05.500
It's not much good to me now, is it?

1:34:05.583 --> 1:34:07.000
I've seen Patrick.

1:34:10.958 --> 1:34:12.416
He asked after you.

1:34:13.833 --> 1:34:15.458
Why did you have to go?

1:34:15.541 --> 1:34:17.583
Everyone else has deserted him.

1:34:22.791 --> 1:34:26.125
Tom, there's something I... have to know.

1:34:28.875 --> 1:34:33.000
Do you... love Patrick?

1:34:33.083 --> 1:34:35.500
-For God's sake, Marion...
-No, it's important.

1:34:35.583 --> 1:34:37.666
Do you love him?

1:34:52.208 --> 1:34:53.666
I love you.

1:35:15.708 --> 1:35:17.583
I can't lose you.

1:35:18.708 --> 1:35:20.916
Let's not mention his name again.

1:38:14.375 --> 1:38:15.500
What's this?

1:38:15.583 --> 1:38:17.958
I need to talk to you.

1:38:18.041 --> 1:38:21.041
-You're going out?
-Tom, please.

1:38:21.125 --> 1:38:23.666
I've tried to help Patrick,

1:38:23.750 --> 1:38:26.958
but he fights me at every turn,
and you're angry all the time.

1:38:27.041 --> 1:38:28.958
Oh, what the devil
are you trying to do now?

1:38:29.041 --> 1:38:31.041
Let me speak.

1:38:31.125 --> 1:38:34.333
I think I brought Patrick here
because I've been so lonely.

1:38:34.416 --> 1:38:35.416
What do you mean?

1:38:35.500 --> 1:38:37.291
I'm always here.

1:38:37.375 --> 1:38:38.416
You're never here.

1:38:38.500 --> 1:38:40.000
I've never had you, not for myself.

1:38:40.083 --> 1:38:43.166
He was always in your life, in our lives.

1:38:43.250 --> 1:38:46.583
Just stop this foolishness.

1:38:46.666 --> 1:38:48.166
Sit down. I'll make us some tea.

1:38:48.250 --> 1:38:49.625
You say we never talk?

1:38:49.708 --> 1:38:51.958
-All right, we'll talk.
-I'm leaving.

1:38:53.375 --> 1:38:54.458
What?

1:38:54.541 --> 1:38:56.791
I can't stay here. It will kill me.

1:38:56.875 --> 1:38:59.083
For God's sake,
you brought him back into our lives.

1:38:59.166 --> 1:39:02.000
You s-stirred everything up, and now,
and now you think you're going to leave.

1:39:02.083 --> 1:39:03.083
And what do I do?

1:39:03.166 --> 1:39:06.250
Oh, for once, Tom,
you might take care of yourself.

1:39:06.333 --> 1:39:08.833
Oh, so now we're back to this,
how I-I ruined your life.

1:39:08.916 --> 1:39:10.708
No, you didn't.

1:39:10.791 --> 1:39:13.500
But you did lie to me.

1:39:13.583 --> 1:39:15.708
From the day we met. And you kept lying.

1:39:15.791 --> 1:39:17.750
You loved Patrick, and...

1:39:17.833 --> 1:39:19.583
-Stop.
-...you still love him.

1:39:19.666 --> 1:39:21.708
-Just stop.
-All of these years,

1:39:21.791 --> 1:39:24.541
I've blamed myself
for keeping the two of you apart,

1:39:24.625 --> 1:39:27.583
and I never really thought,
"What have I missed?"

1:39:27.666 --> 1:39:30.166
No, I'm not, I'm not,
I'm not listening to this.

1:39:30.250 --> 1:39:32.875
I reported Patrick to the museum.

1:39:36.208 --> 1:39:37.916
It was me.

1:39:46.916 --> 1:39:50.833
When the two of you were in Venice,
I felt so betrayed.

1:39:50.916 --> 1:39:54.708
And then your postcard came.

1:39:54.791 --> 1:39:58.708
It felt like you were taunting me.

1:39:58.791 --> 1:40:01.583
I-I just felt so humiliated.

1:40:02.875 --> 1:40:05.791
Then it occurred to me
there was something I could do

1:40:05.875 --> 1:40:08.083
to win you back and save our marriage.

1:40:10.166 --> 1:40:14.291
I wrote an anonymous letter
to Patrick's supervisor.

1:40:17.166 --> 1:40:20.125
I said I had personal knowledge
that Patrick was a homosexual

1:40:20.208 --> 1:40:23.541
and I imagined he wouldn't want
the museum's patrons

1:40:23.625 --> 1:40:28.000
exposed to that kind of person,
especially children.

1:40:39.541 --> 1:40:41.666
The next day, I regretted it,

1:40:41.750 --> 1:40:45.000
and I've had to live with it ever since.

1:40:52.375 --> 1:40:54.333
I-I tried to make up for what I'd done

1:40:54.416 --> 1:40:57.083
by standing up for him
at the trial, but...

1:41:01.291 --> 1:41:03.916
You know what happened.

1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:07.208
So I decided

1:41:07.291 --> 1:41:09.666
the only thing left for me to do

1:41:09.750 --> 1:41:12.500
was to get you through the mess we'd made,

1:41:12.583 --> 1:41:14.583
and I thought, "Now I'll have him.

1:41:16.208 --> 1:41:17.875
I'll have him for myself."

1:41:17.958 --> 1:41:19.708
But I never did.

1:41:22.375 --> 1:41:24.208
You destroyed him.

1:41:25.333 --> 1:41:27.208
We destroyed each other.

1:41:31.333 --> 1:41:33.333
I shouldn't have deceived you.

1:41:35.250 --> 1:41:36.875
It wasn't right.

1:41:36.958 --> 1:41:39.583
But I-I couldn't tell you.

1:41:40.541 --> 1:41:42.916
You would've left me, and...

1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:44.666
I did want you.

1:41:47.500 --> 1:41:49.500
But I wanted him, too.

1:41:54.875 --> 1:41:58.541
Nigel's number is there on the counter.

1:41:58.625 --> 1:42:00.791
-And the chemist.
-You can't be serious.

1:42:00.875 --> 1:42:02.958
We don't make each other happy.

1:42:03.041 --> 1:42:05.500
-Of course we do.
-No, Tom.

1:42:05.583 --> 1:42:09.083
You-you have the sea, your swimming.

1:42:09.166 --> 1:42:12.000
I don't even like Peacehaven.

1:42:12.083 --> 1:42:15.458
When I pictured my retirement, I saw...

1:42:16.625 --> 1:42:19.708
...museums, the theater, weekends in--

1:42:19.791 --> 1:42:21.166
I don't know, something.

1:42:21.250 --> 1:42:22.375
What do you want from me?

1:42:22.458 --> 1:42:24.041
Uh, do you want me to beg you to stay?

1:42:24.125 --> 1:42:26.125
All right. I am begging you.

1:42:26.208 --> 1:42:28.625
Tom, Patrick's failing.

1:42:29.916 --> 1:42:34.416
I think he can turn around,
but I have to wash my hands of it.

1:42:34.500 --> 1:42:38.375
You can send him to a home,
but I hope you won't.

1:42:38.458 --> 1:42:40.708
I hope you'll keep him here and love him.

1:42:40.791 --> 1:42:42.125
It's what he needs.

1:42:42.208 --> 1:42:43.583
It's what you need. And I need to go.

1:42:43.666 --> 1:42:45.500
-I'll be at my sister's for a while...
-Please, please.

1:42:45.583 --> 1:42:46.875
-...and then I'll have to...
-Please don't go.

1:42:46.958 --> 1:42:48.416
Please don't go.

1:42:48.500 --> 1:42:50.250
I can't...

1:42:50.333 --> 1:42:52.041
I can't live alone.

1:42:52.125 --> 1:42:54.708
Tom, you're not alone.
