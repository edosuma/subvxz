00:40.457 --> 00:44.586
Sid: This is a story
of life and death.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.547
Specifically, one life
and one death.

00:48.924 --> 00:52.344
More specifically, mine.

00:58.934 --> 01:01.728
My name is Sid Sandagger,
and I have figured out

01:01.728 --> 01:03.939
the key
to a long and happy life.

01:03.939 --> 01:09.319
It's quite simple.
Don't mess with the system.
Think about it.

01:09.319 --> 01:12.155
Every awful thing
that happens to someone
in their life,

01:12.155 --> 01:14.575
it can be chalked up
to them ripping at the fabric

01:14.575 --> 01:17.953
of the social continuum.
So don't.

01:17.953 --> 01:19.663
There's a natural order
to things in life,

01:19.663 --> 01:21.248
and it is not
to be reckoned with.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.000
And nowhere
is that more important

01:23.000 --> 01:26.128
than the one environment
more strict,

01:26.128 --> 01:28.589
more brutal, and more savage

01:28.589 --> 01:31.592
than all of the rest--
high school.

01:31.592 --> 01:35.929
Luckily, I've developed
three simple rules
to ensure survival.

01:35.929 --> 01:40.058
Rule number one?
Shut up.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.393
Most people
don't get beaten up

01:41.393 --> 01:43.437
for what they don't say.

01:43.437 --> 01:48.358
Rule number two,
don't stand out.

01:48.358 --> 01:52.613
This applies to everything,
from what you wear,
to who your friends are,

01:52.613 --> 01:55.282
to what extra-curriculars
you're a part of.

01:55.282 --> 01:59.369
I have mastered
the art of the nondescript
extra-curricular.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.997
For example, I'm comptroller

02:01.997 --> 02:04.082
for the Eastland High
student council,

02:04.082 --> 02:07.461
understudy
for the school play...

02:07.461 --> 02:10.339
♪ You make me alive ♪

02:10.339 --> 02:13.217
...equipment manager
for the hockey team...

02:13.217 --> 02:15.219
Hey, yo. Incoming!

02:15.219 --> 02:18.639
...and starter for
the Eastland e-sports team.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.141
E-sports, need I say more?

02:21.141 --> 02:24.978
Midnight tonight, boys.
You excited, Cunningham?

02:24.978 --> 02:27.856
I hacked into
my parents' internet account
to upgrade our speed.

02:27.856 --> 02:31.777
- Sweet.
- Also, I think my parents
are getting divorced.

02:35.822 --> 02:41.453
And finally, the third
and most important rule.

02:41.453 --> 02:45.457
Don't fuck with Chuck.

02:45.457 --> 02:48.460
Chuck Brawnte,
him and his stupid friends

02:48.460 --> 02:51.046
have a few thousand
subscribers to their
YouTube channel,

02:51.046 --> 02:53.465
which, believe it or not,
people actually
give a shit about.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.467
Whoo! Fuck you, window!

02:55.467 --> 02:57.803
But the real reason everybody
knows who Chuck Brawnte is...

02:57.803 --> 03:00.472
- Are you boys okay over here?
- Pussy bitch!

03:00.472 --> 03:02.641
...is because
he is super violent.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.518
- Come on. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.
- Here's the big one.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.436
Chuck got kicked out
of his old school

03:06.436 --> 03:09.314
for beating a freshmen
nearly to death.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.859
The kid is still in a coma.
Now I'm not a lawyer,

03:11.859 --> 03:14.027
but allow me to present
these three facts.

03:14.027 --> 03:18.824
One, Chuck got off
with a few hours
of community service.

03:18.824 --> 03:21.076
Two, Chuck's dad
is super rich

03:21.076 --> 03:24.288
because he owns
all the Mercedes dealerships
in upstate New York.

03:24.288 --> 03:27.499
And three, the judge
hearing Chuck's case

03:27.499 --> 03:30.085
now drives a top of the line
Mercedes Benz.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.212
Get the picture?

03:41.138 --> 03:42.139
Fuh...

03:42.139 --> 03:43.932
Well, there you have it,

04:17.508 --> 04:19.760
And your dad's a Republican,
and you're marrying a woman,

04:19.760 --> 04:23.096
- so already kinda anxious.
- Fair point.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.098
- Hey!
- Hey.

04:27.434 --> 04:32.272
How was school?

04:32.272 --> 04:35.943
To me that said,
"Fuck off, Moms,
but I love you."

04:35.943 --> 04:40.447
- No.
- If he was half-Korean,
this would not be happening.

04:40.447 --> 04:45.035
Sid: School was great.
I woke up, I went to class,
and then I came home.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.537
It was perfectly predictable,

04:46.537 --> 04:49.164
which is
perfectly acceptable.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.583
As long as
I stick to my rules,

04:51.583 --> 04:53.168
much like
my internet search history,

04:53.168 --> 04:54.586
high school will be a filthy,

04:54.586 --> 04:57.464
nasty, amoral blip
on my radar

04:57.464 --> 05:01.593
that someday will
never have even happened.

05:01.593 --> 05:04.388
Life is about
embracing routine.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.014
- Oh.
- Eat, sleep, play.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.724
It's gonna be a good night.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.102
That is, of course,
except when a new edition

05:10.102 --> 05:12.354
of War Monger comes out.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.314
It's a sacred night.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.816
And on this night,

05:15.816 --> 05:17.609
you don't eat,
you don't sleep,

05:17.609 --> 05:19.611
and you sit at your altar
for hours on end

05:19.611 --> 05:21.196
just praying to stay alive.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.784
It's pure heaven.

05:30.831 --> 05:34.168
Then the semen travels
through the vas deferens,

05:34.168 --> 05:37.421
out the urethra,
and hopefully into the vagina

05:37.421 --> 05:39.423
of someone you're
not just using for sex

05:39.423 --> 05:40.632
and that you're willing
to stick around

05:40.632 --> 05:42.176
and raise the baby with.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.429
Or into an anus.

05:45.429 --> 05:47.014
Any questions?

05:47.014 --> 05:49.850
Oh, my God, dude.
Sex Ed is such bullshit.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.226
Like, I don't understand

05:51.226 --> 05:53.020
why we spend
so much time on condoms.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.022
What is there to know?
You open the shit up,

05:55.022 --> 05:56.273
you stick your junk in it,
and you go to town on somebody.

05:56.273 --> 05:57.900
Sid:My best friend Jim Vega.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.651
Jim cares about two things,

05:59.651 --> 06:01.862
getting laid
and being popular,

06:01.862 --> 06:03.906
and so far
he's achieved neither.

06:03.906 --> 06:05.657
Do they seriously
think dudes are, like,

06:05.657 --> 06:07.784
sticking their balls
in it or something?

06:07.784 --> 06:11.496
You'd be surprised.
What do you want
them to teach?

06:11.496 --> 06:13.040
- Like, I don't know.
- Heads up!

06:13.040 --> 06:15.042
Why don't they teach us
how to fuck awesome?

06:15.042 --> 06:17.878
'Cause it's Sex Ed.
It's not sex class.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.088
Yeah, but what's the difference?
And unlike trigonometry,

06:20.088 --> 06:22.674
this would be, like, practical,
applicable knowledge.

06:22.674 --> 06:25.469
Just talk to
the school board
about it, man.

06:25.469 --> 06:28.472
- Wait, you-- you think so?
- Yeah, why not?

06:28.472 --> 06:30.891
You go to the school board
and you say,

06:30.891 --> 06:33.227
"Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like my teachers

06:33.227 --> 06:35.354
- to teach me
how to fuck awesome."
- I'm serious.

06:35.354 --> 06:37.272
Like, how do you
find the clitoris during
over the pants sex stuff?

06:37.272 --> 06:40.692
Can you not say fucking
"clitoris" in the hallway?

06:40.692 --> 06:42.861
You see, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

06:42.861 --> 06:45.906
Everyone is so horny that
yelling "clit" in the hall

06:45.906 --> 06:47.783
is like yelling fire
in a theater.

06:47.783 --> 06:50.244
Yeah, and you don't yell fire
in a fucking theater.

06:50.244 --> 06:54.957
Regardless,
the clitoris is at the top
of the labia minora.

06:54.957 --> 06:57.501
That sophomore
with the cleft lip?

06:57.501 --> 06:59.503
No, that's Lydia Mindlin.

06:59.503 --> 07:01.505
Yo, Rafi! What's up, man?

07:01.505 --> 07:02.840
- How you doing?
How was that test?
- Who are you?

07:02.840 --> 07:06.426
All right.
Rafi's the best.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.929
- You really shouldn't do that.
- Why? Rafi's my homie.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.722
Rafi's not your fucking homie.

07:10.722 --> 07:13.058
He just tolerates you
because you let him
cheat off you once.

07:13.058 --> 07:14.518
You're just jealous
'cause I'm popular.

07:14.518 --> 07:16.520
- You're not fucking popular,
- Okay.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.188
- And that's a blessing.
- Oh, come on.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.398
Don't start with your whole

07:19.398 --> 07:21.316
"don't mess with the system"
bullshit.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.735
- You're just afraid
to live a little.
- I live.

07:23.735 --> 07:27.114
What do you call
an all-nighter
playing World Of--

07:27.114 --> 07:30.117
Whoa-ly shit. Tiff Mann.

07:30.117 --> 07:33.120
I don't think I've talked
to Tiff Mann since our
figure skating recital

07:33.120 --> 07:35.247
when I was eight years old.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.924
I've been in love with her
the entire time since,

07:45.924 --> 07:49.052
but it's clear
that she didn't exactly

07:49.052 --> 07:51.388
see me as boyfriend material.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.515
I've told you,
no sleepovers at boys' houses.

07:53.515 --> 07:56.143
But, Mom, it's just Sid's.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.477
Come to think of it,
neither did her mom.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.731
Oh, that's fine.

08:00.731 --> 08:02.774
Even more fucked up
than that,

08:02.774 --> 08:04.776
Tiff Mann is dating Chuck.

08:04.776 --> 08:07.988
Yo.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.198
Chuck: Wanna go to
the parking lot right now?

08:09.198 --> 08:11.241
- How was class?
- Sucks.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.410
Mr. Ramirez can literally
lick my butthole.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.621
Suck a dick, Chuck.

08:15.621 --> 08:18.874
All right, class, let's go!

08:18.874 --> 08:22.294
- Two laps around the field!
- Oh, my God.

08:22.294 --> 08:26.590
Dude, do you think
Juliana Ulrich would be down
for a finger in the butt?

08:26.590 --> 08:28.800
Teacher:
Good speed! Keep it up!

08:28.800 --> 08:31.011
I really don't think
girls are as into that
as you think they are.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.971
Are you kidding me?
It's a second G-spot.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.015
And I'm usually pretty good
at telling who would be down.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.809
I'm like the Finger
In The Butt Whisperer.

08:37.809 --> 08:40.020
You know who probably sticks
a bunch of fingers in butts?

08:40.020 --> 08:42.856
- Teacher: Two more laps!
- Chuck. Chuck is the man.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.733
Did you see his latest video?

08:44.733 --> 08:47.152
He totally wrecked
Su-Ming Lee's car
with a pogo stick.

08:47.152 --> 08:50.822
- Chuck's a fucking monster.
- Jim, Jim! Hey.

08:50.822 --> 08:52.824
You haven't told me
what color tie you're
wearing to homecoming.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.409
That's 'cause
I'm not going with you, Luna.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.620
Sid:Meet Luna Peralta.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.413
Luna and Jim have
known each other since
they were in diapers,

08:58.413 --> 09:00.624
and have hated each other
just as long.

09:00.624 --> 09:02.251
Luna does not hold back.

09:02.251 --> 09:04.211
You think I wanna go with you?

09:04.211 --> 09:05.796
Here's a list
of inanimate objects

09:05.796 --> 09:07.381
I would rather take to
Homecoming than you, okay?

09:07.381 --> 09:09.633
Bleach, a bottle of urine,

09:09.633 --> 09:12.094
and rusty nails literally
stuck in my hands.

09:12.094 --> 09:14.847
- Glad we're on the same page.
- My crazy parents only
want me to go with you

09:14.847 --> 09:16.723
'cause they know I'm not
gonna come back pregnant.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.268
Great. Not happening.
Leave me alone. I have herpes.

09:19.268 --> 09:21.854
You wish you had herpes.
That would have to mean
someone touched

09:21.854 --> 09:23.856
- your skinny
little micro-penis.
- It's not skinny.

09:23.856 --> 09:25.691
If anything, girth is my asset
and length is my weakness.

09:25.691 --> 09:26.859
- Okay.
- So fuck off.

09:26.859 --> 09:28.652
Buddy, nothing is your asset,

09:28.652 --> 09:30.863
and being a fuckwad
is your weakness.

09:30.863 --> 09:32.656
Later, shrimp dick.

09:32.656 --> 09:34.074
- She is so mean.
- I know.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.993
- Teacher: Sandagger, Vega!
- I love it.

09:46.086 --> 09:50.799
- Oh, come on, babe.
- Hey! Hold it.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.676
- What's up?
- Oh.

09:52.676 --> 09:56.263
- Oh. You look awful.
- I'm just tired.

09:56.263 --> 10:00.475
- We got an email.
A parent-y email.
- Yes.

10:00.475 --> 10:06.064
Uh, "Please ensure
proper Homecoming attire,"
blah blah blah.

10:06.064 --> 10:10.611
Were you planning on
wearing a very short skirt
to this dance?

10:10.611 --> 10:13.071
Why is this the first time
we're hearing about
this Homecoming?

10:13.071 --> 10:16.533
- 'Cause I'm not going.
- Why not?

10:16.533 --> 10:18.452
Homecoming is a very big deal.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.329
You get all dressed up,
and you wait for some schnook

10:20.329 --> 10:22.289
to pick you up,
and you dance at arm's length,

10:22.289 --> 10:24.249
and then you have
a fleeting sexual encounter.

10:24.249 --> 10:27.336
- And then you realize
that you're a lesbian.
- Yes.

10:27.336 --> 10:28.921
Have you thought
about that, Sid?

10:28.921 --> 10:30.881
You might be a lesbian
and not even know it.

10:30.881 --> 10:33.383
- You do like Brandy Carlile.
- And going to Maine.

10:33.383 --> 10:36.595
- Mm, the signs are all there.
- Come on.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.889
Why aren't you going?

10:40.474 --> 10:43.227
That was a pretty
compelling argument.

10:43.227 --> 10:44.353
Come on.

10:44.353 --> 10:46.480
Think about it.

10:46.480 --> 10:51.818
You don't want to
graduate high school
without any memories.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.947
Actually, I have no problem
leaving high school
without any memories.

10:54.947 --> 10:57.157
I can't imagine
any experience good enough

10:57.157 --> 10:59.326
to risk the possibility
of a bad one.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.037
It's like why I don't have
my driver's license.

11:06.542 --> 11:08.544
And what's so bad about this?

11:08.544 --> 11:10.546
A 72-hour War Monger marathon

11:10.546 --> 11:12.965
is pretty awesome and safe.

11:15.217 --> 11:17.344
Game on, baby.

11:17.344 --> 11:21.181
Okay, well, maybe 72 hours
isn't entirely safe.

11:21.181 --> 11:25.561
According to Google,
there are seven specific
signs of sleep deprivation

11:25.561 --> 11:27.437
that all lead
to complete madness.

11:27.437 --> 11:28.772
Heads up, Tiny Tim.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.899
Ow. Stupid hemorrhoid.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.860
Look alive, fuckface.

11:32.860 --> 11:37.197
Oh, God. Dude, slow down.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.866
What happened to
no carbs till college?

11:38.866 --> 11:42.202
Symptom number one,
you eat a lot.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.580
- I'm fricking starving.
- Oh, pop quiz.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.790
Okay, so you're
driving home from a party
and you can't drive.

11:46.790 --> 11:49.042
What do you take?
Uber or Lyft?

11:49.042 --> 11:51.587
Symptom number two,
you're indecisive.

11:51.587 --> 11:56.008
- I don't know.
- Lyft, 'cause their drivers
are super hot.

11:56.008 --> 11:57.759
Plus, Uber is for fascists.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.803
Symptom number three,
you forget things.

11:59.803 --> 12:01.805
- What are we talking about?
- I'm open, I'm open!

12:01.805 --> 12:03.932
Symptom number four?
Delayed motor skills.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.642
- Come on, come on.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

12:05.642 --> 12:08.312
Symptom number five,
your pain receptors are...

12:08.312 --> 12:09.646
- Heads up!
- ...diminished.

12:09.646 --> 12:13.150
Sorry!

12:13.150 --> 12:17.738
Symptom number six,
your senses get all weird.

12:17.738 --> 12:21.450
And the final symptom
of sleep deprivation

12:21.450 --> 12:25.245
leading to complete madness,
you lose your filter.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.622
Suck a dick, Chuck.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.210
What did you just say?

12:35.506 --> 12:38.634
- Come on.
- What the fuck did you
just say to me?

12:39.927 --> 12:43.847
Um, I said, uh,

12:43.847 --> 12:47.434
I said suck--
suck her lick, Chuck.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.562
I want you guys
to enjoy kissing each other,

12:50.562 --> 12:52.439
'cause, you know, like,
we're not gonna be
young forever.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.859
Uh, I didn't say
that second part,
but I thought it.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.612
Uh, what I said, uh...

13:00.864 --> 13:03.450
I said, "Suck a dick."

13:03.450 --> 13:07.412
Suck a dick,
you pogo stick-riding douchebag.

13:07.412 --> 13:10.207
You think everyone's
afraid of you? Why?

13:10.207 --> 13:13.377
Because you look like
one of those punching bags
shaped like a torso?

13:17.089 --> 13:19.132
Jimenez, my good man.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.968
I'm not his man.
I don't even know
who the hell he is.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.804
- We ride.
- You remember three rules

13:23.804 --> 13:25.472
to getting through
high school alive?

13:25.472 --> 13:30.018
Shut up, don't stand out,
don't fuck with Chuck?

13:30.018 --> 13:32.271
Well, this is what happens
when you break all three

13:32.271 --> 13:37.484
of those rules
in the exact same moment.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.487
Motherfucker.
Tell me another joke.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.990
Tell me another fucking joke.
Huh? Was it worth it?

13:42.990 --> 13:46.159
- I really fucking hope
it was worth it.
- Break it up!

13:46.159 --> 13:48.829
- I'm gonna kill you, kid.
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
- Ow!

13:48.829 --> 13:53.792
- Oh! Oh, oh!
- I am going to end your
goddamn miserable life.

13:53.792 --> 13:59.256
- Come here, kid. Come here.
- The next time I see you,
you are fucking dead.

13:59.256 --> 14:01.842
- Get the fuck off me!
- Are you okay?

14:01.842 --> 14:03.969
Chuck:
...fuck off me. God damn it!

14:12.352 --> 14:14.938
This is fucking fantastic.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.732
I've never seen
something like this.

14:16.732 --> 14:19.735
I mean, terrible--
oh, dude, you're up.

14:19.735 --> 14:21.987
This is a fascinating
porn collection.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.947
How long have I been out?

14:23.947 --> 14:27.159
Dude, you've been out for,
like, seven hours. Here.

14:27.159 --> 14:29.912
The nurse said
that you were gonna sleep
for a really long time.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.043
- What about Chuck?
- So Luna texted me.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.545
I don't even know how
she got through to me
because I blocked her number,

14:38.545 --> 14:42.216
but she said that Chuck
is only gonna be suspended
for 2 1/2 weeks.

14:42.216 --> 14:44.635
- That's it?
- Plus anger management
counseling.

14:46.178 --> 14:47.888
I have two weeks to live.

14:47.888 --> 14:51.350
2 1/2 weeks actually.
So, what? Today's--

14:51.350 --> 14:56.188
Today's Wednesday,
so he's suspended
until the 25th.

14:56.188 --> 14:58.649
Aw, damn it.
That's the day of
the Homecoming dance.

14:58.649 --> 15:00.859
It's not like you need
another reason not to go.

15:00.859 --> 15:04.196
You all right? Sid?

15:04.196 --> 15:05.739
Dude, what are
you thinking about?

15:05.739 --> 15:07.407
- Sid: Death.
- I'm gonna kill you.

15:07.407 --> 15:10.786
I broke my rules,
I fucked with the system,

15:10.786 --> 15:12.496
and this is what I deserve.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.998
Chuck is gonna kill me,
and who's gonna stop him?

15:14.998 --> 15:18.794
Not the police,
not the school,
not the courts.

15:18.794 --> 15:20.671
No one ever has.

15:20.671 --> 15:23.549
Sid, you still awake?

15:29.012 --> 15:33.892
Jim told me you two
called out sick from work.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.394
You feeling okay?

15:43.652 --> 15:44.611
Hmm.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.576
Oh, I get it. Boundaries.

16:13.682 --> 16:17.060
Sid: This can't be it.
This can't be how it ends.

16:17.060 --> 16:18.437
I've gotta find out
where Chuck is

16:18.437 --> 16:19.855
and explain what happened.

16:19.855 --> 16:21.398
He'll understand.

16:21.398 --> 16:22.900
Well, obviously this would
work a little bit better

16:22.900 --> 16:25.944
if I had a banana
that wasn't quite so ripe.

16:25.944 --> 16:27.863
But I can't find
the demo banana,

16:27.863 --> 16:28.906
so I just took this
out of my lunch.

16:28.906 --> 16:30.657
Dude, did you hear?

16:30.657 --> 16:33.076
Chuck's parents sent him
to some anger management class

16:33.076 --> 16:34.703
during his suspension
in, like, Switzerland?

16:34.703 --> 16:36.079
It turns out the Swiss

16:36.079 --> 16:38.665
are masters
of not giving a fuck.

16:38.665 --> 16:42.085
It sounds dope, and rich,
and you can ski there.

16:42.085 --> 16:45.088
- Maybe he'll forgive you.
- And inside the condom...

16:45.088 --> 16:48.091
Mm, no, you're probably right.

16:48.091 --> 16:51.386
- He's probably gonna
murder you. Sorry, dawg.
- All right, question.

16:51.386 --> 16:55.849
What is the only 100% effective
method of contraception?

16:55.849 --> 16:58.810
- Butt stuff.
- No, that's not it.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.687
- Double condoms.
- No.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.314
- Dry humping.
- Abstinence.

17:02.314 --> 17:04.608
It's written--
it's literally on
the board behind me.

17:04.608 --> 17:07.361
Now, Candace is your
student abstinence leader,

17:07.361 --> 17:10.030
so she's agreed
to share her experience

17:10.030 --> 17:12.616
or, well, lack thereof.

17:12.616 --> 17:15.619
So, as you guys know,

17:15.619 --> 17:17.496
I have taken
the abstinence pledge.

17:17.496 --> 17:19.289
I'm in Sex Ed,
and I'm gonna die a virgin.

17:19.289 --> 17:20.874
What are they gonna write
on my tombstone?

17:20.874 --> 17:23.335
"Here lies Sid Sandagger.
He shrugged."

17:23.335 --> 17:25.254
What's wrong with me?
Was this really my life?

17:25.254 --> 17:26.964
I can't die like this.

17:26.964 --> 17:29.132
Is this why my moms
want me to make memories?

17:29.132 --> 17:31.969
In case some psycho
with a YouTube channel
pounds me to death

17:31.969 --> 17:33.512
on the dance floor
at Homecoming

17:33.512 --> 17:36.139
to a Taylor Swift ballad?
I'm sick of it!

17:36.139 --> 17:37.349
And this abstinence queen
going on

17:37.349 --> 17:39.142
and on and on and on

17:39.142 --> 17:41.103
- and on and--
- Fuck that.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.062
Sid?

17:44.731 --> 17:47.818
- I'm sorry.
- Candace, please continue.

17:47.818 --> 17:51.154
I'm sorry that
I've wasted so much time
in this dumb class.

17:51.154 --> 17:53.574
Excuse me. Sid Sandagger!

17:53.574 --> 17:55.325
Candace, I'm sorry for
interrupting you, but come on.

17:55.325 --> 17:57.953
Be honest with yourself.
Aren't you tired of lying?

17:57.953 --> 18:02.916
Have you ever dealt
with unhealthy, unclean urges

18:02.916 --> 18:05.294
or impure thoughts?

18:05.294 --> 18:07.546
At this very moment.

18:07.546 --> 18:10.716
Do you know what I think about
on a daily basis?

18:10.716 --> 18:12.384
It would traumatize you.

18:12.384 --> 18:13.844
And then I search it
on the internet,

18:13.844 --> 18:14.970
and it exists
and there's porn for it.

18:14.970 --> 18:16.388
That means I'm not alone.

18:16.388 --> 18:18.765
You're probably horny
all the time, too!

18:18.765 --> 18:21.226
- Actually--
- It's okay, Candace!

18:21.226 --> 18:23.520
You can admit to flicking it
every now and again.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.398
- No one's gonna crucify you.
- Dude, I don't know
what you're doing,

18:26.398 --> 18:28.984
- but please keep going.
- I'm horny.

18:28.984 --> 18:30.819
You are horny!

18:30.819 --> 18:33.697
Everyone in this room is horny!

18:33.697 --> 18:35.490
Like, what's the big deal?

18:35.490 --> 18:38.994
It takes a slight breeze,
and I am hard as a rock!

18:38.994 --> 18:40.245
All right, Sandagger,
lock it up.

18:40.245 --> 18:41.788
Come on, Dr. Capanna.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.999
This is Sex Ed,
for crying out loud.

18:43.999 --> 18:45.792
How can you just stand there

18:45.792 --> 18:48.504
and let this girl
make us all feel badly

18:48.504 --> 18:51.215
for having completely normal
sexual appetites?

18:51.215 --> 18:53.383
- How do you sleep at night?
- Yeah, I don't.

18:55.010 --> 18:56.803
I have really bad apnea.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.723
- It's not because of this.
- Why?

18:59.723 --> 19:03.018
Why do we all have to pretend

19:03.018 --> 19:04.645
that we don't
want to fuck each other

19:04.645 --> 19:06.230
six ways to the weekend?

19:06.230 --> 19:08.106
We should embrace it!

19:08.106 --> 19:09.650
For crying out loud,

19:09.650 --> 19:11.777
I can see Dave Guggenheim's
boner from here.

19:11.777 --> 19:15.239
And you know what?
I love your boner, Dave.

19:15.239 --> 19:17.950
- Because Dave's boner
is in all of us.
- Yeah.

19:17.950 --> 19:21.828
- We are all Dave's boner!
- Yeah.

19:21.828 --> 19:25.457
And I'm not gonna sit here
and let you make everyone
in this room feel bad

19:25.457 --> 19:29.127
- for having completely normal
sexual appetites.
- Yeah!

19:29.127 --> 19:34.258
My name is Sidney Sandagger,

19:34.258 --> 19:37.511
and I once put a Sharpie
inside of my own butthole.

19:43.100 --> 19:45.811
- I humped a melon.
- Okay, Guggenheim!

19:45.811 --> 19:48.564
I cut a hole in it,
and I microwaved it,
and then I humped it.

19:48.564 --> 19:50.774
Hell yeah, man.
That is disgusting.

19:50.774 --> 19:53.694
Okay, don't encourage him.
That's a UTI waiting to happen.

19:53.694 --> 19:56.029
I get off to porn
of guys doing it
with other guys.

19:56.029 --> 19:59.157
- Sit down!
- I use my electric toothbrush
as a vibrator.

19:59.157 --> 20:00.909
My boyfriend and I
are into macrophilia.

20:00.909 --> 20:02.953
I have a reoccurring sex dream
about Elizabeth Warren.

20:04.079 --> 20:05.205
I have vertical balls!

20:05.205 --> 20:07.124
Oh.

20:07.124 --> 20:09.501
Like,
instead of a left one
and a right one,

20:09.501 --> 20:11.795
I have an upstairs
and a downstairs.

20:11.795 --> 20:13.547
It's like two-thirds
a snowman.

20:13.547 --> 20:16.175
It goes pickle, potato,
potato, cinnamon doughnut.

20:16.175 --> 20:19.052
That is so hot.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.888
Okay, all right, all right.

20:20.888 --> 20:24.016
Warner, Sandagger,
Guggenheim, okay.
Oh, God damn it.

20:24.016 --> 20:25.893
- No one's taking home condoms.
- Sid, Sid.

20:28.353 --> 20:31.106
Sid, dude!
Dude, what the hell was that?

20:31.106 --> 20:34.318
- I don't know.
- Dude, that was brilliant!

20:34.318 --> 20:36.737
- Come on! Say something!
- I don't know, man.

20:36.737 --> 20:38.488
Dude, that was
fucking incredible!

20:38.488 --> 20:40.741
Like, fuck every
other revolutionary
that's come before you.

20:40.741 --> 20:43.535
Like, you are the Messiah.
You are Jesus returning.

20:43.535 --> 20:44.912
Candace should've
fucking recognized that.

20:44.912 --> 20:46.788
Like, you are
the king-fucking-penis.

20:46.788 --> 20:49.333
Your schlong definitely
grew three inches from that.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.335
Whatever it is that
made it click for you,

20:51.335 --> 20:53.462
- that's what we gotta
tell everyone about.
- What?

20:53.462 --> 20:55.756
Oh, my God. Sid, we're gonna
get so much pussy from this.

20:55.756 --> 20:58.175
I was so inspired.
I feel liberated!

20:58.175 --> 21:00.552
Like, this is how...

21:03.764 --> 21:06.350
- Sid: Who is this?
- Jim: Hugh Hefner would be
so proud of you,

21:06.350 --> 21:07.935
may his soul rest
in fucking peace.

21:07.935 --> 21:09.770
Like, he would be so happy.

21:09.770 --> 21:12.564
I'm going home
and I'm trying that...

21:16.985 --> 21:20.447
- ...like vagina juice.
- Sid: What's next?

21:20.447 --> 21:22.574
- That's fucking brilliant!
- How the hell should I know?

21:22.574 --> 21:23.659
It's so DIY, and, like...

21:26.203 --> 21:28.997
I've never really
thought about it before.

21:28.997 --> 21:30.582
I mean, I don't think
I want to deliver pizzas

21:30.582 --> 21:32.584
with Jim
for the rest of my life,

21:32.584 --> 21:34.962
but I'm a senior
in high school.

21:34.962 --> 21:36.922
I don't even know
what I wanna wear tomorrow.

21:38.382 --> 21:41.718
What if I die, Jim?
What if I die?

21:41.718 --> 21:45.597
What are you talk--
Chuck isn't gonna kill you.

21:45.597 --> 21:49.601
Dude, he beat a kid
nearly to death,

21:49.601 --> 21:51.186
and he's been beating
people ever since.

21:51.186 --> 21:53.146
It's not like he's
getting any worse at it.

21:54.189 --> 21:56.441
Oh, God. Two weeks.

21:58.402 --> 21:59.820
What if this is it?

22:01.613 --> 22:03.156
Oh, that is just so sad.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.617
Look, Chuck isn't
gonna kill you, dawg.

22:05.617 --> 22:09.204
- I'll protect you.
- Yeah, sure, you will.

22:09.204 --> 22:11.415
Unless he offers
to let you be in one
of his fucking videos.

22:11.415 --> 22:13.834
You think he'd ever
let me be in one?

22:15.210 --> 22:17.129
- Fuck you, man.
- I'm kidding.

22:17.129 --> 22:21.842
But, like, let's say
for a second that Chuck
might actually kill you,

22:21.842 --> 22:26.430
which I'll admit
is a possibility because
he does have a record.

22:26.430 --> 22:28.849
So in this hypothetical world,

22:28.849 --> 22:30.934
then you got two weeks
left to live.

22:30.934 --> 22:32.895
What do you wanna do?

22:38.025 --> 22:38.984
That.

22:40.152 --> 22:42.404
Skip rocks?

22:42.404 --> 22:46.241
No, live.

22:46.241 --> 22:48.243
I wanna fucking live.

22:48.243 --> 22:50.204
What do you mean?

22:52.372 --> 22:54.791
Sidney, where has
that Sharpie been?

22:56.710 --> 23:01.048
Sid, what are you doing?

23:01.048 --> 23:03.091
"Win at some--"

23:03.091 --> 23:04.885
What does that even mean?

23:04.885 --> 23:08.472
I don't know.
I have no idea.

23:08.472 --> 23:11.266
But I'm not gonna,
like, you know,

23:11.266 --> 23:14.978
get a promotion
or start a company

23:14.978 --> 23:18.065
or have a fling
with some foreign girl
on a train in Europe.

23:18.065 --> 23:20.692
Everything that
you do in life,

23:20.692 --> 23:23.403
everything that makes life good,
I have to do it right now.

23:23.403 --> 23:28.116
I don't want just some memories.
I want all the memories.

23:30.494 --> 23:31.662
"Know real love."

23:34.289 --> 23:35.666
Are you gonna die a virgin?

23:42.214 --> 23:46.301
Yeah! That's my boy!
Let's go!

23:46.301 --> 23:48.512
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

23:50.973 --> 23:55.561

23:55.561 --> 23:57.521

24:01.817 --> 24:05.070
So you're gonna do
all of this in two weeks?

24:06.947 --> 24:09.783
Yeah. What have I got to lose?

24:14.955 --> 24:18.750
Hey! You want some dinner?

24:18.750 --> 24:23.547
Stay impenetrably silent

24:59.791 --> 25:03.587

25:03.587 --> 25:06.798
Dude! Sid, dude,
everyone is talking about

25:06.798 --> 25:08.842
your "I'm Boner Spartacus" bit
in Sex Ed yesterday.

25:08.842 --> 25:10.511
- Like, in a good way?
- Yes, like, in a fucking ama--

25:10.511 --> 25:13.388
- Jim! Jim.
- Oh, my God.

25:13.388 --> 25:15.015
Luna, what the fuck
do you want?

25:15.015 --> 25:17.142
I don't remember saying
Beetlejuice three times.

25:17.142 --> 25:18.977
Ha, ha, ha.
You're so funny, Jim.

25:18.977 --> 25:20.938
We need to buy tickets
for Homecoming,

25:20.938 --> 25:22.814
and you have to pay
for them, so...

25:22.814 --> 25:25.025
Well, make sure you tell that
to the Japanese sex robot

25:25.025 --> 25:26.485
that you get to take you
to the dance,

25:26.485 --> 25:28.445
'cause I'm not going
with you, Luna.

25:28.445 --> 25:30.822
Dude, dude, dude, dude.
Incoming heatseekers inbound.

25:30.822 --> 25:31.865
- What?
- Hey.

25:33.784 --> 25:35.827
Holy shit.

25:35.827 --> 25:38.956
Oh, please, God,
let Tiff Mann be
my secret texter.

25:38.956 --> 25:40.832
Uh, hey. Hey.

25:40.832 --> 25:44.753
- I'm Tiff.
- Oh, I know.

25:44.753 --> 25:49.925
Um, listen, I just wanted
to say I'm really sorry
about what Chuck did to you.

25:49.925 --> 25:53.220
Oh, no, that's--

25:53.220 --> 25:55.055
that's, uh-- he's--

25:55.055 --> 25:57.307
- that's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

25:57.307 --> 25:59.643
His parents say that
he has impulsivity issues,

25:59.643 --> 26:03.063
but I think he can
just be a dick sometimes.

26:03.063 --> 26:05.858
Yeah, yeah.

26:05.858 --> 26:10.070
Also are you going to
go the game tonight?

26:10.070 --> 26:12.823
He'll be there,
and so will I.

26:16.285 --> 26:18.704
Now is probably a good time
to talk about hockey.

26:18.704 --> 26:20.289
Let me see you get it in net.

26:20.289 --> 26:22.332
Hockey is a pretty
big deal in Eastland.

26:22.332 --> 26:24.418
- Let's get it in!
- Score a goal,

26:24.418 --> 26:27.546
and you get to feel
what it's like to be a god.

26:27.546 --> 26:30.090
Brad passes it to Worsham.
And he goes for the shot.

26:30.090 --> 26:35.762
He shoots. He scores!

26:35.762 --> 26:38.098
You know who knows that
feeling better than anyone?

26:38.098 --> 26:41.226
- Whoo!
- Eric Worsham.

26:41.226 --> 26:43.478
Eric, Eric, Eric!

26:43.478 --> 26:45.939
Eric is like a king
in Eastland.

26:45.939 --> 26:49.902
Face-off at center ice!

26:49.902 --> 26:52.196
Good move, man.
Good move, Eric. Come on!

26:52.196 --> 26:55.324
But heavy is the head
that wears the helmet.

26:55.324 --> 26:58.160
Eric has to be perfect,
because if he's not...

26:58.160 --> 27:00.954
Move your fucking feet!
Come on!

27:00.954 --> 27:04.917
...he gets to enjoy
a lifetime of pain
and humiliation.

27:04.917 --> 27:08.128
And they're alone!

27:08.128 --> 27:13.091
And just like that,
the Fighting Spirits have
sent this game into overtime.

27:13.091 --> 27:15.719
Get the fuck up,
you fucking piece of shit!

27:15.719 --> 27:18.263
Eric, that goal!
That's on you!

27:18.263 --> 27:20.349
And Coach Worsham expressing
his frustrations

27:20.349 --> 27:22.935
as they make their way
to the locker room.

27:22.935 --> 27:25.479
I wouldn't wanna be
at that dinner table tonight.

27:25.479 --> 27:26.939
Oh, yeah.
Did I forget to mention?

27:26.939 --> 27:29.816
That psycho coach?
Also Eric's dad.

27:29.816 --> 27:32.945
You know what you are?
I can't even say the word

27:32.945 --> 27:35.405
because the school board
won't let me call you
"pussies" anymore.

27:35.405 --> 27:37.658
You pissed away the last period.

27:37.658 --> 27:39.660
God damn, look at me when
I'm fucking talking to you!

27:39.660 --> 27:41.954
Beat the fuck out of someone
out there, okay?

27:41.954 --> 27:44.164
Like we're back
in fucking 'Nam!

27:44.164 --> 27:46.208
What have I got,
a bunch of pacifists?

27:46.208 --> 27:48.877
Or do I have me some warriors
in this fucking room?

27:48.877 --> 27:52.172
Now, I love you boys.
You know I do.

27:52.172 --> 27:54.883
On three. One, two, three!

27:54.883 --> 27:57.177
- Go, Frogs!
- Whoo! Go, Frogs!

27:57.177 --> 27:59.346
Come on, guys.
Let's go, come on.

27:59.346 --> 28:02.724
Come on, boys, let's go.
Get out there and fucking win.

28:02.724 --> 28:05.185
Come on!
I love you guys.

28:05.185 --> 28:08.522
Get out there, play hard,
play fast.

28:08.522 --> 28:10.315
Come on, guys.
Let's go, come on.

28:25.581 --> 28:26.832
You don't have go out there.

28:28.792 --> 28:30.961
What the hell
are you talking about, man?

28:30.961 --> 28:32.421
Say you go out there, right?

28:32.421 --> 28:34.089
And you do whatever
the hell it was

28:34.089 --> 28:36.550
your dad was screaming about,
and you win the game,

28:36.550 --> 28:38.385
and you win
a lot more games, right?

28:38.385 --> 28:41.054
You get a scholarship,
and now you're playing NCAA.

28:41.054 --> 28:42.764
And you do really well there.

28:42.764 --> 28:45.058
And now you're playing
in the NHL.

28:45.058 --> 28:48.228
And now you have fans
and money and women

28:48.228 --> 28:49.771
and you might even win
the Franklin Cup.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.565
- Stanley.
- The Stanley Cup.

28:53.609 --> 28:56.153
But you'll still be miserable,

28:56.153 --> 29:00.240
because you're not
playing to win.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.409
You're playing not to lose.

29:04.620 --> 29:06.246
- I don't know.
- I know what it's like

29:06.246 --> 29:07.247
to live your life
the way you do

29:07.247 --> 29:09.374
because you're afraid.

29:09.374 --> 29:12.252
I used to hide
in all kinds of places.

29:12.252 --> 29:16.381
- You hide in here.
- I gotta get back out there.

29:20.052 --> 29:21.220
No, you don't.

29:23.555 --> 29:26.058
Crowd: Let's go, Frogs!
Let's go, Frogs!

29:26.058 --> 29:29.436
Sid: Turns out jockstraps
are super uncomfortable,

29:29.436 --> 29:31.855
especially when you're using
somebody else's.

29:31.855 --> 29:35.567
And we got Eric Worsham
returning to the ice.

29:35.567 --> 29:37.653
Looks like he took
a few extra minutes of rest,

29:37.653 --> 29:39.530
and he'll need it against
these Fighting Spirits.

29:40.572 --> 29:42.407
And face-off at center ice.

29:42.407 --> 29:44.201
The drop!

29:46.870 --> 29:49.998
Eric Worsham going offsides.

29:49.998 --> 29:52.501
Ooh, you don't see that
from Worsham every day.

29:52.501 --> 29:55.671
- Uh, we've got a face-off
deep in the Frog territory.
- I'm good, bro.

29:55.671 --> 29:58.507
Jim: There's the drop!
Worsham has got the puck.

29:58.507 --> 30:01.593
Oh! Worsham is pounded by
the Spirits, and he's down.

30:01.593 --> 30:02.970
Coach:
Get your fucking heads
in the game, kids.

30:02.970 --> 30:04.096
Jim: Looks like
that'll leave a mark.

30:04.096 --> 30:05.472
Coach:
Come on, let's go, boys.

30:05.472 --> 30:08.225
Let's go! God damn it.

30:08.225 --> 30:09.852
What the fuck are you doing?

30:09.852 --> 30:12.479
You cock-sucking
son of a fucking bitch.

30:15.107 --> 30:18.485
Sid: And then I remembered
why I was here.

30:18.485 --> 30:21.113
For in the realm of the dead,
where I'm going,

30:21.113 --> 30:23.240
I wanna be able
to talk about this shit.

30:23.240 --> 30:24.992
The Frogs lining up
with the Fighting Spirits

30:24.992 --> 30:28.203
- in striking distance.
- Let's go, E.

30:28.203 --> 30:30.914
Referee: All right, boys,
sticks down, face-off.

30:30.914 --> 30:34.793
Jim: And the puck is down.

30:34.793 --> 30:38.714
Oh! With a huge collision
on center ice.

30:38.714 --> 30:40.007
Worsham now has the puck.

30:43.093 --> 30:44.928
Fuck fear.

30:44.928 --> 30:46.889
I've been doing a lot
of avoiding in my life.

30:46.889 --> 30:48.891
Time to put it to good use.

30:48.891 --> 30:51.894
- Jim: Oh, he dodges!
- Come on!

30:51.894 --> 30:53.812
Jim: He's getting close
to the goal!

31:00.402 --> 31:02.946
With a spin like a ballerina!

31:04.239 --> 31:05.741
He shoots!

31:05.741 --> 31:07.743
No fear, motherfucker!

31:07.743 --> 31:08.994
He scores!

31:10.454 --> 31:14.124
Eric Worsham brings
the Frogs to victory!

31:14.124 --> 31:17.544
Crowd:
Eric, Eric, Eric!

31:17.544 --> 31:21.965
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

31:27.304 --> 31:31.141
- Sid.
- What the fuck?

31:31.141 --> 31:35.771
Sid? Is that the guy that shoved
the sharpie up his asshole?

31:35.771 --> 31:38.857
Um, correction,
that goal was scored by,

31:38.857 --> 31:40.859
and I can't believe
I'm saying this,

31:40.859 --> 31:45.405
my best friend Sid Sandagger!

31:52.079 --> 31:56.083
He's 160 pounds
of pure sexual energy,

31:56.083 --> 31:57.835
and he's very, very single!

31:57.835 --> 31:59.419
Go, Sid!

32:03.674 --> 32:07.553
Hey. Who the fuck are you?

32:07.553 --> 32:10.806
I'm a friend of your son's,
I guess?

32:10.806 --> 32:13.267
I clean the jockstraps.
I give them--
I'm, like, their penis--

32:13.267 --> 32:15.227
Where the fuck
did you learn that thing?

32:15.227 --> 32:18.438
I, um-- I...

32:18.438 --> 32:22.192
Fantastic Figure Skating
for Fabulous Five-Year-Olds.

32:24.027 --> 32:25.070
Can you be
at practice tomorrow?

32:27.030 --> 32:28.740
Yeah.

32:28.740 --> 32:31.410
Yes, sir. Yes, coach.

33:43.690 --> 33:45.192
Jim: I don't know
what you did to Eric,

33:45.192 --> 33:48.695
but that was some
serious Jedi voodoo shit.

33:48.695 --> 33:51.156
He was just afraid.
I used to live like that.

33:51.156 --> 33:54.576
- Dude, he quit hockey.
He joined the dance team.
- Good for him.

33:54.576 --> 33:56.870
- Yo, what up, Sid?
- What's up, Sandagger?

34:00.707 --> 34:01.834
Who are you?

34:03.669 --> 34:04.711
Moving on.

34:04.711 --> 34:06.129
With Arlene in the hospital

34:06.129 --> 34:08.382
for her
Seasonal Affective Disorder,

34:08.382 --> 34:10.050
I will be assuming
the role of interim

34:10.050 --> 34:11.343
student body president.

34:11.343 --> 34:13.345
However,
according to school bylaws,

34:13.345 --> 34:14.930
we will hold a special election

34:14.930 --> 34:16.723
to determine
a permanent replacement

34:16.723 --> 34:18.851
for the remainder
of the year.

34:18.851 --> 34:21.019
Obviously, I will need
a vice-president to run with.

34:21.019 --> 34:24.565
You'll be working with me,
designing campaign signs,

34:24.565 --> 34:28.735
ironing out our platform,
and of course, debating
alongside me in three days.

34:28.735 --> 34:33.699
Expect long, gruesome hours
and a whole lot of fun.

34:33.699 --> 34:35.742
Now, raise your hand

34:35.742 --> 34:36.910
if you'd like
to be considered.

34:40.747 --> 34:42.958
Sid: You know, I'm not sure
when it became cool

34:42.958 --> 34:46.795
to hate on Megan Waters,
or even why, really.

34:46.795 --> 34:48.755
But a few months ago,
some kid started
a FarmersOnly account

34:48.755 --> 34:51.175
and posted pictures of her
with a bunch of dicks

34:51.175 --> 34:52.676
and other stuff
flying around.

34:52.676 --> 34:54.928
People can be such jerks.

34:54.928 --> 34:57.389
And when do they decide
that's the one
we're gonna torture?

34:57.389 --> 35:00.601
That's the one
that we're gonna make
feel like shit?

35:00.601 --> 35:02.519
It isn't right.

35:05.606 --> 35:07.399
Great.

35:07.399 --> 35:08.984
I'll give you guys
some time to think it over

35:08.984 --> 35:10.485
and I'll put a sign-up sheet
on the door.

35:10.485 --> 35:13.572
Meeting adjourned.

35:13.572 --> 35:16.325
Before I die, I said
I'd fuck up the system.

35:16.325 --> 35:18.994
Helping Megan Waters
just might be the way.

35:18.994 --> 35:21.330
- Hey, Megan.
- Hey, Sid.

35:21.330 --> 35:23.165
About the whole
vice-president thing?

35:23.165 --> 35:24.791
I'm sure that
I'll find somebody.

35:24.791 --> 35:27.961
I would--
I would love to run with you.

35:29.588 --> 35:32.424
- Really?
- Yeah. Why not?

35:32.424 --> 35:35.219
Well, I should probably vet you
against the other candidates

35:35.219 --> 35:36.762
before I make
any final decisions.

35:40.390 --> 35:42.768
Right. Welcome to the ticket.

35:44.811 --> 35:47.022
I've never really done drugs.

35:47.022 --> 35:49.107
Oh, except in sixth grade
when I took two Tylenol

35:49.107 --> 35:50.817
and drank
three Diet Dr Peppers

35:50.817 --> 35:53.237
and ended up riding
the mammoth at the museum.

35:53.237 --> 35:55.447
Haven't really
experimented since.

35:55.447 --> 35:58.450
This is the shit you want.
You ever spent
the night with molly?

35:58.450 --> 36:01.036
Uh, spent what?

36:01.036 --> 36:02.329
Oh, yeah. No.

36:02.329 --> 36:04.623
Um, what is molly exactly?

36:04.623 --> 36:06.667
You ever been rolling
down a hill in the ice

36:06.667 --> 36:08.794
but felt really hot
in your soul?

36:08.794 --> 36:13.298
Um, no.

36:13.298 --> 36:15.467
It's, like, spiritual.

36:15.467 --> 36:17.678
The real you comes out.

36:17.678 --> 36:18.762
You're gonna trip balls.

36:18.762 --> 36:21.265
Cool. Sweet.

36:21.265 --> 36:22.850
Um, how much do I owe you?

36:22.850 --> 36:27.479
- How much you want?
- Just a few... bits.

36:27.479 --> 36:30.065
- Bits?
- Pieces? I don't know.

36:30.065 --> 36:32.484
Just a handful.
I don't-- what--

36:32.484 --> 36:34.069
Just enough
to have a good time.

36:34.069 --> 36:36.947
- 80.
- 80. Cool.

36:36.947 --> 36:39.867
Usually, I'd be
saving this money for,
I don't know, my future?

36:39.867 --> 36:41.493
That's the nice thing
about imminent death.

36:41.493 --> 36:43.495
It makes financial planning
a lot easier.

36:43.495 --> 36:46.790
But don't take more
than half a pill at a time.

36:46.790 --> 36:47.791
- Half a pill?
- Yeah.

36:47.791 --> 36:49.835
Got it. Okay.

36:49.835 --> 36:54.298
- Minty fresh.
Just like this shit.
- Thank you.

36:54.298 --> 36:56.300
You think that Candace chick
would be down to hump?

36:56.300 --> 36:59.720
The abstinence cop? No.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.346
No, man,
I don't think she is.

37:03.307 --> 37:05.184
I might be catching
feelings for her.

37:05.184 --> 37:06.476
That's too bad, man.

37:12.065 --> 37:15.652
You know what, Dave?
Why wait?

37:15.652 --> 37:18.113
If not now, then when, right?

37:18.113 --> 37:20.949
- Boner bros.
- Boner bros.

37:23.410 --> 37:25.162
Like, a lot of puss.

37:25.162 --> 37:27.748
Oh, dude,
the Frakas twins are having
a party this weekend.

37:27.748 --> 37:30.167
- We gotta go.
- Sweet. What kind of party?

37:30.167 --> 37:32.794
Aw, dude,
it's a wine-tasting party.

37:32.794 --> 37:36.590
They got Austrian whites,
they got a sommelier coming.

37:36.590 --> 37:39.885
I mean, he's gonna-- I mean--
what do you think kind of party?

37:39.885 --> 37:41.345
Yeah, dude.
Whatever, I'm in.

37:41.345 --> 37:42.930
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

37:42.930 --> 37:46.058
Fuck yes, dude!
That's what I'm talking about.

37:46.058 --> 37:47.476
Dude, I thought I was
gonna have to sell that.

37:47.476 --> 37:49.561
Like, for real,
I had this whole thing prepared

37:49.561 --> 37:52.564
about how if we both hook up,
we would be brothers.

37:52.564 --> 37:53.774
Like, not that
we're not already brothers,

37:53.774 --> 37:55.776
but we would be like
boner brothers.

37:55.776 --> 37:59.071
Oh, dude, I'm so sorry,
but Dave Guggenheim
already called that.

38:14.294 --> 38:16.964
You know, I always suspected
Tiff Mann was an angel,

38:16.964 --> 38:18.966
but am I really
falling in love

38:18.966 --> 38:22.386
with an honest to goodness
celestial being?

38:22.386 --> 38:24.930
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, were you
masturbating again?

38:24.930 --> 38:26.974
- What? No!
- That's okay.

38:26.974 --> 38:28.392
Masturbation promotes health.

38:28.392 --> 38:30.060
That's why grandma's
never had the flu.

38:30.060 --> 38:32.104
- Can I help you guys?
- Well, when you are a parent,

38:32.104 --> 38:36.358
and your son's Sex Ed teacher
Dr. Capanna calls you

38:36.358 --> 38:38.652
and tells you that your son
has flipped out in class...

38:38.652 --> 38:41.738
Dr. Capanna, by the way,
sounds like the biggest moron.

38:41.738 --> 38:45.617
But also, if your son,
say, mysteriously ends up

38:45.617 --> 38:48.787
on the cable access
sports channel pucking a goal,

38:48.787 --> 38:51.832
we have no choice
but to get very invasive

38:51.832 --> 38:54.251
and ask what exactly
is going on?

38:54.251 --> 38:56.170
- I'm fine.
- Do you know what?

38:56.170 --> 38:57.504
- You don't look fine.
- Mm-mm.

38:57.504 --> 39:00.591
I had teeny little
mishap at school.

39:00.591 --> 39:01.884
- With a girl?
- No.

39:01.884 --> 39:03.886
- With Dr. Capanna?
- No.

39:06.471 --> 39:10.392
Okay, well,
if you change your mind,
you know where to find us.

39:18.233 --> 39:20.152
- Friday.
- Hmm?

39:20.152 --> 39:23.197
I have another game on Friday.

39:23.197 --> 39:26.950
And I am going to
Homecoming next week.

39:28.744 --> 39:31.121
Do you want us
to ask a girl out for you?

39:31.121 --> 39:33.081
Because we are good at that.

39:33.081 --> 39:35.918
No thank you, no.

39:47.888 --> 39:50.098
Well, all right.

39:50.098 --> 39:51.892
It appears as though
I am not the only one

39:51.892 --> 39:53.310
who is fucking up
the system nowadays.

39:53.310 --> 39:56.897
Whoo!

39:58.440 --> 40:00.067
Hey, take five, guys.
What's up?

40:00.067 --> 40:01.610
- What's up, man?
- How you doing?

40:01.610 --> 40:02.819
I'd heard you joined
the dance team.

40:02.819 --> 40:04.613
That's-- that was--
that was awesome.

40:04.613 --> 40:07.157
- Hey, nice goal
the other night.
- Thanks, man.

40:07.157 --> 40:08.742
Hey, I wanted to
tell you something.

40:08.742 --> 40:13.914
Um, just thank you
for talking to me
the other night.

40:13.914 --> 40:15.707
I feel like
I'm finally having fun
in high school.

40:15.707 --> 40:17.709
- I'm happy for you, man.
- I should get back there,

40:17.709 --> 40:21.171
- but have a good game Friday.
- Careful on those backflips.

40:21.171 --> 40:23.966
- Hey, don't let my dad
ride you too hard.
- I won't!

40:23.966 --> 40:28.470
- See you around, Sid.
Let's go again.
- All right! Okay, one...

40:33.934 --> 40:35.519
Good God, understudy,

40:35.519 --> 40:37.145
I cannot wait
to kiss that mouth.

40:37.145 --> 40:40.482
It's, like, the hottest
face hole I've ever seen.

40:40.482 --> 40:41.525
God.

40:41.525 --> 40:42.985
Only a total tool

40:42.985 --> 40:44.027
would call Tiff Mann's

40:44.027 --> 40:45.988
perfect lips a face hole.

40:45.988 --> 40:49.157
Then again, Erwin Mueller
is a total tool.

40:49.157 --> 40:52.077
Voice on PA:
This time with lights, please.
Thank you.

40:52.077 --> 40:57.457
♪ Me, alive ♪

40:57.457 --> 41:02.087
♪ You make me alive ♪

41:04.798 --> 41:10.429
♪ A final kiss
before I burn your body ♪

41:10.429 --> 41:14.308
Also, what the fuck
even is this show?

41:14.308 --> 41:16.351
Megan: 'Cause we know that
Olivia's gonna go after

41:16.351 --> 41:18.770
those one-issue
plastic straw voters,

41:18.770 --> 41:20.647
who aren't even informed,
and they don't even know

41:20.647 --> 41:22.357
that it's landfills
that are causing

41:22.357 --> 41:25.152
the most pollution
in our entire planet.

41:25.152 --> 41:26.778
But we have to appeal to them.

41:26.778 --> 41:28.947
We have to appeal
to that dumb demographic.

41:28.947 --> 41:31.366
Hey!
You know, that's really rude,

41:31.366 --> 41:33.452
to just rifle through
people's things?

41:33.452 --> 41:36.371
What is it? Is it, like,
a diary or a journal?

41:36.371 --> 41:38.790
Is it a hit list?
Are you an assassin?

41:38.790 --> 41:43.921
It sounds stupid,
but I write poetry sometimes.

41:43.921 --> 41:46.340
- Can I hear one?
- No.

41:46.340 --> 41:48.050
- Please?
- No.

41:57.267 --> 41:59.770
Look, it's...

42:01.396 --> 42:02.523
I'm still fixing them.

42:09.947 --> 42:12.658
Rainbows contain
all of the colors,

42:12.658 --> 42:16.411
but white light contains all
of the colors of the rainbow.

42:16.411 --> 42:20.082
I am the white light
on a cold night.

42:20.082 --> 42:21.667
And if you look just right,

42:21.667 --> 42:26.171
you will see all
of the colors inside of me.

42:27.840 --> 42:30.843
There.
Now we can get back
to recycling.

42:30.843 --> 42:33.428
- That was great.
- You don't have to like it.

42:33.428 --> 42:37.432
- I know.
- You know, I've never actually

42:37.432 --> 42:39.768
read one of my poems out loud.

42:39.768 --> 42:45.232
Normally when
I try to talk to people,
they just walk away.

42:45.232 --> 42:49.486
Megan, I'm sorry
that I never stuck up for you
in student council.

42:49.486 --> 42:51.196
- It's fine.
- It's not.

42:51.196 --> 42:53.448
It's not. I'm sorry.

42:55.200 --> 42:58.662
Okay, we really need
a stronger stance on cardboard.

42:58.662 --> 43:02.124
Let's just take a break.

43:03.417 --> 43:05.419
I can't just take a break, Sid.

43:05.419 --> 43:07.671
Every minute that we take off

43:07.671 --> 43:09.882
is another one that
Olivia Binghman doesn't.

43:09.882 --> 43:12.676
That dirty whore
has been trying to steal
the council from me for years,

43:12.676 --> 43:16.138
and we are not
about to let that happen.

43:16.138 --> 43:17.222
Mm-hmm.

43:18.682 --> 43:20.392
- Your breath stinks.
- I'm good.

43:20.392 --> 43:23.437
- I have some in my bag.
- Good, 'cause I'm almost out.

43:26.857 --> 43:30.944
I've been meaning to get
the average joe perspective.

43:30.944 --> 43:33.572
What do you feel?
Paper or plastic?

43:36.867 --> 43:40.704
Yeah, my mom threw a hairdryer
at my dad last night.

43:40.704 --> 43:44.583
- I don't know if he bled,
but it look like it hurt.
- Oh, my God.

43:44.583 --> 43:49.671
- Um...
- I wanna believe in love,
but I don't know anymore.

43:51.965 --> 43:56.303
Yeah, that's one of life's
greatest mysteries.

43:56.303 --> 43:58.305
It's big, right?
Like, life-changing.

43:58.305 --> 44:00.933
Mm-hmm, and it's--
just don't feel like
it's your fault.

44:00.933 --> 44:02.893
- I'm sure it's not your fault.
- It might be.

44:11.944 --> 44:13.153
Sorry. I need a minute.

44:13.153 --> 44:16.281
Yeah, take-- I'm sorry. Yeah.

44:18.951 --> 44:20.994
- I didn't mean
to make that weird.
- No, no.

44:20.994 --> 44:22.621
- I'm good. I'm surviving.
- Yeah, of course.

44:22.621 --> 44:24.957
I just-- I wanna be there
and I don't know with to say

44:24.957 --> 44:29.545
because I don't-- I never--
my parents are still in love.

44:29.545 --> 44:32.631
- So, sorry. I just--
- Yeah, thanks for
rubbing that in.

44:32.631 --> 44:37.344
- Um, I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

44:38.762 --> 44:39.847
Announcer:
Attention, Eastland Frogs.

44:39.847 --> 44:41.348
The student council assembly

44:41.348 --> 44:43.642
will begin in ten minutes
in the auditorium.

44:43.642 --> 44:45.352
Where the fuck
have you been, Sandagger?

44:45.352 --> 44:46.979
Megan, this is the men's room.

44:46.979 --> 44:48.772
I know.
What the hell are you
doing in here, huh?

44:48.772 --> 44:52.609
- I'm just peeing.
- You peed?

44:52.609 --> 44:56.905
Every great politician knows,
"No pee before debate.

44:56.905 --> 44:59.783
It's the pee
that makes you great."

44:59.783 --> 45:02.244
I haven't pissed in four days.

45:02.244 --> 45:04.162
Oh, my God.
That's incredibly unhealthy.

45:04.162 --> 45:06.540
By the way, your mints,
they taste like shit.

45:10.377 --> 45:14.256
- No. Oh, shit.
- What?

45:14.256 --> 45:16.341
Are they not mints?

45:18.010 --> 45:20.387
- Uh, kind of.
- Kind of?

45:20.387 --> 45:23.223
Okay, there's no such thing as
kind of when it comes to mints.

45:23.223 --> 45:26.101
They either refresh
your breath or they don't.

45:26.101 --> 45:27.686
They freshen your perspective.

45:29.229 --> 45:30.439
Oh, my God, they're a drug.

45:30.439 --> 45:33.275
I've never taken a drug before!

45:36.528 --> 45:39.448
Get the fuck out of here, Eli!

45:39.448 --> 45:42.367
- Move!
- And vote Megan Waters!

45:42.367 --> 45:45.746
Nobody's gonna vote
Megan Waters now.

45:45.746 --> 45:47.748
Relax. It's okay.

45:47.748 --> 45:49.833
- I think I need to call
my pediatrician.
- It's gonna be fine.

45:49.833 --> 45:53.045
I'm-- you're gonna be fine.
I promise.

45:53.045 --> 45:54.713
You're gonna go out there,

45:54.713 --> 45:56.048
and you're gonna be yourself,

45:56.048 --> 45:57.299
and everyone's gonna love you.

45:57.299 --> 45:59.635
- No one loves me, Sid!
- Jesus.

45:59.635 --> 46:01.386
No one even likes me.

46:01.386 --> 46:05.265
Because people like you and me,
we're not pretty.

46:05.265 --> 46:07.392
No! But we're smart.

46:07.392 --> 46:10.771
And that means that
we're supposed to have
good lives after we leave.

46:10.771 --> 46:15.692
No. Megan,
we're gonna start now.

46:16.777 --> 46:18.278
See?

46:20.072 --> 46:22.449
You're gonna be fine,
I promise.

46:23.825 --> 46:24.785
Okay.

46:26.870 --> 46:29.164
So what drug was it
that we took?

46:46.890 --> 46:48.475
- Oh, okay.
- Your turn, your turn.

46:48.475 --> 46:50.310
Hey, everyone. Sid Sandagger.

46:50.310 --> 46:52.229
Uh, it is my strong opinion

46:52.229 --> 46:55.023
that Megan
is the fucking best.

46:55.023 --> 46:56.483
- I'm serious, girl,
you're such--
- Really?

46:56.483 --> 46:58.694
- Yeah, you're the fucking shit.
- Aw, dude.

46:58.694 --> 47:01.405
- I love you so fucking much.
- Such good friends.
We've blossomed.

47:01.405 --> 47:02.656
- Our friendship has blossomed.
- Aww, Sid.

47:02.656 --> 47:05.701
Oh, yeah, of course.
Friends.

47:05.701 --> 47:07.327
Okay, I hear ya.

47:07.327 --> 47:11.707
We have evaluated things
and come to the conclusion

47:11.707 --> 47:13.500
that you have all
been cocks to her.

47:13.500 --> 47:15.335
Yeah, you guys--
you guys have been cocks.

47:15.335 --> 47:16.712
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You've been cocks!

47:16.712 --> 47:18.797
Especially you,
Jonathan Gliggman.

47:18.797 --> 47:21.133
Yeah, but she is wonderful,

47:21.133 --> 47:23.135
wonderful,
if you can't tell already.

47:23.135 --> 47:24.261
- Thank you.
- And I think it's about time

47:24.261 --> 47:25.721
that you got to
know her yourself.

47:25.721 --> 47:29.349
So, um, well, without
much further ado, Megan.

47:29.349 --> 47:31.185
Be yourself.
You got this.

47:33.145 --> 47:34.313
Whoo!

47:44.531 --> 47:47.075
I am a prism.

47:47.075 --> 47:51.371
I refract.

47:51.371 --> 47:54.208
But I glow for me.

47:56.376 --> 48:00.172
And I dance for you.

48:00.172 --> 48:05.177
And you and you and you
and everybody!

48:05.177 --> 48:08.388
Not her! You made your signs
with signs with glitter,

48:08.388 --> 48:10.682
and I went to Kinko's, bitch.

49:58.498 --> 50:02.794
Hello, understudy.
I thought I smelled you.

51:33.760 --> 51:37.055
Whoo! Yeah, Sid!

51:38.849 --> 51:41.226
My acting coach says
I need to follow
my instincts.

51:41.226 --> 51:46.899
Huh. Wait, you have a--
you have an acting coach?

51:46.899 --> 51:50.444
- On YouTube.
- Well, that's 21st century.

Um, do you want to--
would you like to go maybe

51:54.615 --> 51:57.868

- Oh, yeah. Okay.

52:07.794 --> 52:09.630
Sick. Cool. Uh, dope.

52:09.630 --> 52:12.007
I'll pick you up at 10.

52:12.007 --> 52:14.301
- You'll text me?
- I don't have your number.

52:14.301 --> 52:16.094

Oh, no. No.
Buttons are totally slimming.

52:45.666 --> 52:47.918
- What time again?
- Um, so, 10.

52:47.918 --> 52:51.088
So then I'll pick you up at 9:30
'cause we gotta get Luna first.

52:51.088 --> 52:54.258
- Dude, you're taking Luna?
- It's just for show. What?

52:54.258 --> 52:56.635
Mom!

52:56.635 --> 52:58.929
No wonder you don't like Luna.
You're too busy falling
in love with Sid!

52:58.929 --> 53:02.850
- Mom! Making me date
that brown fire hydrant--
- She is a lovely girl.

53:02.850 --> 53:05.477
- She's like Satan in the flesh.
- I will smack your ass

53:05.477 --> 53:07.604
- back to next Thursday, okay?
- Okay, okay, okay.

53:07.604 --> 53:09.690
That's the kind of woman
you could slap around
in bed a little.

53:09.690 --> 53:11.984
- Okay, Mom, please stop.
- I punched your father
in the face!

53:11.984 --> 53:15.571
- Eww, eww! Mom!
- And then I got down on him
and just went to town!

53:15.571 --> 53:17.197
- Mom!
- Si, and...

53:34.548 --> 53:36.675
Okay. What the fuck.

53:38.594 --> 53:42.639
Oh, that was too many knocks.
Too many knocks. Okay.

53:42.639 --> 53:45.100
- You're not even
gonna say I look nice?
- You don't look nice.

53:45.100 --> 53:46.935
You look like
an incredibly mean person

53:46.935 --> 53:48.228
because you are one.

53:48.228 --> 53:50.731
You have the mustache
of a child molester

53:50.731 --> 53:52.816
and the haircut
of a molested child.

53:55.903 --> 53:57.487
Relax, relax.

54:10.292 --> 54:13.170
- Hey.
- Hey.

54:13.170 --> 54:17.132
Is that your minivan?

54:19.384 --> 54:23.222
It's Jim's.
Great for families.

54:28.644 --> 54:30.479
Fuck my life.

54:30.479 --> 54:32.439
You ever wonder
what life is like

54:32.439 --> 54:34.066
for the cool kids?

54:34.066 --> 54:37.027
Well, tonight I find out.

54:41.156 --> 54:42.741
You okay?

54:46.161 --> 54:48.580
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

54:48.580 --> 54:50.374
- Wanna get a drink?
- Oh, yeah.

54:50.374 --> 54:51.792
- Totally.
- Let's do it.

54:58.757 --> 55:00.717
Cheers.
Let's just go for it. Okay.

55:00.717 --> 55:03.804
- Nice-- oh, you--
- Oh, my God.

55:03.804 --> 55:06.515
- Is this one bad?
- Sid, come hit this!

55:14.731 --> 55:18.110
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug!

55:18.110 --> 55:20.028
Chug, chug, chug, chug!

55:28.537 --> 55:31.623
This is literally
the coolest fucking party

55:31.623 --> 55:33.625
that I have ever been to
in my entire life.

55:33.625 --> 55:37.212
Why doesn't anybody want
to go ride a horse with me?

55:37.212 --> 55:39.214
You wanna do one?
Guys, let's go--

55:39.214 --> 55:42.467
Dude, give them their moment.
Stop hopping on the...

55:42.467 --> 55:44.219
For a moment...

55:44.219 --> 55:47.097
...this party
felt like heaven.

55:52.060 --> 55:53.520
Luna: Oh, like you haven't
thought about it.

55:53.520 --> 55:57.399
Yo. Why aren't you
responding to my texts?

55:57.399 --> 55:59.776
'Cause I don't want
to talk to you.

55:59.776 --> 56:03.363
- Okay, let's go for a walk.
- No.

56:03.363 --> 56:08.452
We're gonna go for a walk,
'cause we clearly have things--

56:08.452 --> 56:11.747
What the fuck?

56:11.747 --> 56:14.625
- Uh, uh, Chuck. Yo, dawg.
- I need you to shut up.

56:14.625 --> 56:17.252
Sid: Who gets out of anger
management a week early?

56:17.252 --> 56:20.672
- Fuck you, Switzerland.
- Dude, don't.

56:20.672 --> 56:24.259
- Don't do this.
- David, Candace, I--

56:24.259 --> 56:28.222
I really appreciate it,
but I'm fine.

56:31.058 --> 56:34.269
Well, now I see
why you wanted
to get me suspended,

56:34.269 --> 56:36.897
you little piece of shit.

56:36.897 --> 56:39.358
Give me one good reason

56:39.358 --> 56:41.193
why I shouldn't
kill you right now.

56:41.193 --> 56:44.655
- Uh...
- This is it.

56:44.655 --> 56:48.867
Barring divine intervention,
I am... dead?

56:50.661 --> 56:52.287
Oh!

56:55.415 --> 56:59.711
- Not again. Oh!
- It may not have been
a burning bush,

56:59.711 --> 57:03.215
but if an exploding car
at the time of your
imminent demise

57:03.215 --> 57:04.925
isn't evidence
of a higher power,

57:04.925 --> 57:06.009
then I don't know what is.

57:06.009 --> 57:08.220
Halle-fucking-lujah!

57:08.220 --> 57:10.806
Let's get the hell out of here.

57:10.806 --> 57:12.516
- Yeah.
- I think God just did that.

57:12.516 --> 57:14.768
That was fucking dope!

57:14.768 --> 57:17.855
Oh, my God.

57:22.901 --> 57:24.820
- Oh, I'm shaking.
- It just--

57:24.820 --> 57:27.322
That happened, right?
You saw that too?

57:27.322 --> 57:30.200
I feel like we're in
a rap video or something.

57:30.200 --> 57:32.494
- What happened?
- I don't know.

57:39.626 --> 57:41.962
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

57:41.962 --> 57:44.131
That just came out.
I don't even know
what noise that was.

57:44.131 --> 57:48.343
It sounded like
you put a pig in a blender.

57:48.343 --> 57:51.346
Um, I'm so confused.

57:51.346 --> 57:53.765
Have you not been texting me
this whole time?

57:53.765 --> 57:55.309
No, I told you,
I don't have your number.

57:55.309 --> 57:58.770
Look, the truth is, Sid,

57:58.770 --> 58:01.690
I've been trying
really hard to like you.

58:01.690 --> 58:04.234
I mean, like that.

58:04.234 --> 58:07.571
That's cool, because
I want to like you, too.

58:07.571 --> 58:11.658
And I do like you,
so I'm like a success story
you can really look up to.

58:16.121 --> 58:20.834
You know, I've just--
I've felt so trapped dating
Chuck the past few years.

58:20.834 --> 58:23.003
He and I, we have this cycle.

58:23.003 --> 58:26.131
It's, like,
we fight, we break up,
we get back together.

58:26.131 --> 58:28.175
He gets into some
kind of insane trouble

58:28.175 --> 58:30.177
and I swear that
I'm gonna never date him again.

58:30.177 --> 58:35.933
And then I just end up
back with him again.

58:37.935 --> 58:42.272
I guess I just thought
that maybe if I liked you

58:42.272 --> 58:45.817
then I wouldn't go back
to him, you know?

58:45.817 --> 58:47.945
I wouldn't make
the same mistake.

58:51.323 --> 58:53.825
But...

58:53.825 --> 58:59.414
But I just-- I don't feel
that way about you, Sid.

58:59.414 --> 59:00.999
I'm sorry.

59:05.546 --> 59:06.505
Friends?

59:24.439 --> 59:26.024
She didn't even
jerk you off?

59:30.028 --> 59:30.988
Bummer.

1:00:16.408 --> 1:00:18.785
Screw, Chuck.
He can't touch me.

1:00:18.785 --> 1:00:20.204
- What's up, Sid?
- Yo.

1:00:20.204 --> 1:00:21.830
When he left,
I was invisible.

1:00:21.830 --> 1:00:24.499
Now I'm invincible.

1:00:24.499 --> 1:00:27.503
I'm like a hero,
and people protect heroes.

Hey, can I talk to you guys?

1:01:16.301 --> 1:01:17.970
I think-- I think that--

1:01:17.970 --> 1:01:19.346
I think that you should log off.

1:01:19.346 --> 1:01:20.931
Get the fuck outta here.

1:01:20.931 --> 1:01:23.559
Okay, I get it. I do.

1:01:23.559 --> 1:01:28.772
I love being in here,
but I think you're--

1:01:28.772 --> 1:01:30.941
I just--
I think you're missing out.

1:01:30.941 --> 1:01:32.693
Trust me. I'm you.

1:01:32.693 --> 1:01:36.113

Out there,

like they do in here.

1:01:40.325 --> 1:01:43.579
There's a lot more out there
than orcs and night elves

1:01:43.579 --> 1:01:47.374
and you shouldn't be spending
your whole lives hiding.

1:01:51.503 --> 1:01:54.298
Yeah, all right. Okay.

1:02:07.644 --> 1:02:09.980
Whoa, whoa. Sorry. Hey!

1:02:12.232 --> 1:02:14.067

who you are at this point.

1:02:49.645 --> 1:02:52.231
Good weird, though.

mad respect for the guy.

1:08:23.187 --> 1:08:24.813
Dude, he's been going crazy.

1:08:24.813 --> 1:08:27.774
He spiked that theater kid's
makeup with Icy Hot

1:08:27.774 --> 1:08:29.276
just so he could go onstage.

1:08:29.276 --> 1:08:31.653

crazy high for her debate.

1:08:31.653 --> 1:08:33.280
- Megan fucking waters?
- Yeah, yeah.

1:08:33.280 --> 1:08:35.032
Chuck: He's just trying
to live it up before I X him?

1:08:35.032 --> 1:08:37.618
And, dude,
he's determined
to get laid, too.

1:08:37.618 --> 1:08:39.203
He tried sticking it
to Tiff Mann.

1:08:39.203 --> 1:08:41.663
- But don't worry.
She said no.
- Yeah?

1:08:41.663 --> 1:08:43.207
Jim: Now he's trying
to hit on this gamer chick.

1:08:43.207 --> 1:08:44.791
He even went to church with her

1:08:44.791 --> 1:08:46.293
just so that
he could get in her pants

1:08:46.293 --> 1:08:47.586
all before
you fucking kill him.

1:08:47.586 --> 1:08:49.421

1:08:49.421 --> 1:08:51.215

1:08:57.554 --> 1:09:00.474
Chuck: 'Cause I'm gonna

1:09:07.231 --> 1:09:09.858

1:09:17.407 --> 1:09:19.117
- Hey!
- Slow down!

1:09:23.497 --> 1:09:24.957
Fuck off, noob.

1:09:36.426 --> 1:09:38.846
What was everyone
so upset about?

1:09:38.846 --> 1:09:41.682
Yeah, they were
part of a list. So what?

1:09:41.682 --> 1:09:45.394
I still did all the things
they thought were great.

1:09:45.394 --> 1:09:48.021
But after the video,
everything went to shit.

1:09:49.857 --> 1:09:51.650
I was kicked off the ice,

1:09:51.650 --> 1:09:53.652
and the rest of the guys
refused to play with me.

1:09:56.154 --> 1:09:59.283
Megan was put on
disciplinary probation
for doing drugs,

1:09:59.283 --> 1:10:01.785
and then kicked off
student council.

1:10:01.785 --> 1:10:06.081
Candace re-pledged
her eternal abstinence
and dumped Dave.

1:10:06.081 --> 1:10:08.125

1:10:08.125 --> 1:10:10.919

to be sick today?

1:10:21.096 --> 1:10:23.098
- Hey, man.
- Dude, seriously? Go away.

1:10:23.098 --> 1:10:24.641
- Sid, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Go, dude.

1:10:24.641 --> 1:10:26.518
- I made a mistake.
- Don't fucking touch me.

1:10:26.518 --> 1:10:28.312
- Leave, man.
- I made a mistake.
Just hear me out.

1:10:28.312 --> 1:10:29.688
Just let me talk
for a little bit.

1:10:29.688 --> 1:10:31.899
Do you have any idea
what the fuck you've done?

1:10:31.899 --> 1:10:37.112
- Sid, I do know what I did.
- You have literally
ruined everything.

1:10:37.112 --> 1:10:41.366
All you ever wanted was for
someone popular to like you,
and they never will.

1:10:41.366 --> 1:10:42.534
Luna, was right, Jim.

1:10:42.534 --> 1:10:45.329
You are an insecure
attention whore

1:10:45.329 --> 1:10:46.747
who would literally sell out

1:10:46.747 --> 1:10:49.082
the only real friend
that you have ever had

1:10:49.082 --> 1:10:51.668
for the chance at someone
with more fucking followers.

1:10:51.668 --> 1:10:54.880
Sid. Sid, I'm sorry, dude.

1:10:54.880 --> 1:10:57.508
Sid, come on! Sid!

1:11:01.011 --> 1:11:04.640
Jim is an idiot.

1:11:04.640 --> 1:11:05.766
Stupid.

1:11:09.937 --> 1:11:15.943
I wasn't just trying
to get with you.

1:11:15.943 --> 1:11:17.444
I promise.

1:11:21.281 --> 1:11:22.824
God.

1:11:31.667 --> 1:11:32.751
I know.

1:11:49.977 --> 1:11:52.479
Aah! God!

1:12:06.493 --> 1:12:08.370
This is why I have rules.

1:12:08.370 --> 1:12:09.621
This is why I said to shut up

1:12:09.621 --> 1:12:11.039
and to stay under the radar

1:12:11.039 --> 1:12:13.000
and to not mess
with the system.

1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.419
Because when you speak up,
when you care,

1:12:15.419 --> 1:12:17.421
and when you stop
being afraid,

1:12:17.421 --> 1:12:20.424
people will hurt you.

1:12:20.424 --> 1:12:22.050
They will find
that thing inside of you

1:12:22.050 --> 1:12:24.636
that you try so hard
to guard and protect,

1:12:24.636 --> 1:12:26.638
and they will poke at it
and jab at it

1:12:26.638 --> 1:12:30.809
until you want to just crawl
into a little ball and cry,

1:12:30.809 --> 1:12:33.395
and then you might
as well be dead.

1:12:50.245 --> 1:12:54.041
Why haven't you been
answering Jim's DMs?

1:12:54.041 --> 1:12:56.502
I don't really feel like
talking to him right now.

1:12:56.502 --> 1:12:58.879
What he did was stupid.

1:12:58.879 --> 1:13:01.965
But what do you expect?
It's Jim.

1:13:01.965 --> 1:13:05.052
He has
the emotional intelligence
of a premature baby

1:13:05.052 --> 1:13:08.096
and the actual intelligence
of one of those baboons
with the red asses.

1:13:08.096 --> 1:13:10.057
Those are just baboons.

1:13:10.057 --> 1:13:12.184
And they use tools,
they're brilliant animals.

1:13:12.184 --> 1:13:13.435
Well, Jim isn't.

1:13:14.686 --> 1:13:16.230
But he's also your best friend.

1:13:20.150 --> 1:13:21.610
You're coming to
Homecoming tonight, right?

1:13:21.610 --> 1:13:25.572
No. I don't have a date.
I don't have a ride.

1:13:25.572 --> 1:13:28.909
I got you a tie
and boutonnière
when Jim got his.

1:13:28.909 --> 1:13:31.286
Fair warning,
he did that dumb thing

1:13:31.286 --> 1:13:33.705
where he got the pimp cane
and the top hat.

1:13:33.705 --> 1:13:34.831
Ugh.

1:13:34.831 --> 1:13:37.918
As far as a date goes,
fuck it.

1:13:37.918 --> 1:13:40.170
Just show up,
or you'll regret it.

1:13:41.505 --> 1:13:42.923
Chuck will kill me.

1:13:42.923 --> 1:13:45.968
- I blew up Chuck's car.
- What?

1:13:45.968 --> 1:13:47.803
Yeah.

1:13:58.814 --> 1:14:01.316
Grain alcohol
is surprisingly flammable.

1:14:01.316 --> 1:14:03.652
Luna, that's insane.
And a felony.

1:14:03.652 --> 1:14:06.071
- Maybe.
- It is.

1:14:06.071 --> 1:14:08.115
- But do you know why I did it?
- Because you're fucking nuts?

1:14:08.115 --> 1:14:11.743
Because for a moment,
you gave everyone hope.

1:14:11.743 --> 1:14:14.538
Look at all those people
whose lives you affected

1:14:14.538 --> 1:14:16.540
just by being
an arrogant little shit

1:14:16.540 --> 1:14:19.960
by refused to play
by the rules and be quiet.

1:14:19.960 --> 1:14:23.297
Now everybody just thinks
I was using them for
some stupid bucket list.

1:14:23.297 --> 1:14:26.300
But stay home
and hide from Chuck?

1:14:28.760 --> 1:14:30.053
You'll be showing them
that they're right.

1:14:33.765 --> 1:14:35.934
Well, I gotta get back
before lunch is over.

1:14:43.817 --> 1:14:45.319
For you.

1:14:47.154 --> 1:14:49.323
Later, fuckwad.

1:15:07.799 --> 1:15:10.928
- I think we have to start over.
- You know how to tie a tie?

1:15:10.928 --> 1:15:13.514
Can you get a YouTube video
just in case?

1:15:13.514 --> 1:15:16.642
Oh, did you know that this
is called an oriental knot?

1:15:16.642 --> 1:15:18.644
- It goes around
the tree trunk.
- Yeah.

1:15:18.644 --> 1:15:21.396
- Did it.
- Photo time.

1:15:27.194 --> 1:15:28.529
Oh, man, this is my song!

1:15:39.206 --> 1:15:41.041
Get up.

1:15:41.041 --> 1:15:45.087
- Get up.
- Nice cane.

1:15:45.087 --> 1:15:49.424
- Thanks.
- Look, man, I'm sorry

1:15:49.424 --> 1:15:51.218
about some of that stuff
that I said.

1:15:51.218 --> 1:15:54.179
Yeah, you said
some pretty rough stuff.

1:15:54.179 --> 1:15:56.056
I do think you care
a little bit too much

1:15:56.056 --> 1:15:59.434
about being popular,
but I get it.

1:15:59.434 --> 1:16:01.687
I know how good it felt
when I finally started
to get some attention,

1:16:01.687 --> 1:16:03.897
so I don't blame you.

1:16:03.897 --> 1:16:06.066
Boner brothers?

1:16:06.066 --> 1:16:09.236
I thought that was you
and Dave Guggenheim's thing.

1:16:09.236 --> 1:16:12.447
Come on, Jimenez.

1:16:12.447 --> 1:16:14.074
You'll always be
my boner brother.

1:16:15.450 --> 1:16:17.202
I'm gonna go spike the punch.

1:16:24.459 --> 1:16:26.879
Give him some time.

1:16:26.879 --> 1:16:28.422
Jim doesn't think very fast.

1:16:31.466 --> 1:16:33.468
You look nice.

1:16:33.468 --> 1:16:35.679
Thanks.

1:16:35.679 --> 1:16:37.097
You look beautiful.

1:16:37.097 --> 1:16:38.223
I know.

1:16:42.269 --> 1:16:46.106
- Um, will you give me a second?
- Yeah.

1:16:46.106 --> 1:16:50.152
Hey. Um, just--

1:16:50.152 --> 1:16:52.112
- Hey, please.
- Sid, I don't wanna have
this conversation.

1:16:52.112 --> 1:16:54.865
This isn't that.
It's not that conversation.

1:16:54.865 --> 1:16:57.910
This isn't me saying
that I made a mistake,

1:16:57.910 --> 1:17:01.496
or that there was
some big misunderstanding,

1:17:01.496 --> 1:17:04.917
or even telling you that
you're the love of my life

1:17:04.917 --> 1:17:06.919
or the only one for me
or anything.

1:17:06.919 --> 1:17:08.754
This isn't even me
trying to win you back.

1:17:08.754 --> 1:17:11.673
- Okay, then what is it?
- It's goodbye.

1:17:14.301 --> 1:17:17.304
I just-- I wanted
to say that I've had

1:17:17.304 --> 1:17:20.140
a lot of bad days
and a few good ones.

1:17:20.140 --> 1:17:24.811
But the ones that
I spent with you, Katie,
were the best ones.

1:17:24.811 --> 1:17:27.981
And I'm so thankful to you
for that.

1:18:03.433 --> 1:18:04.476
You ready?

1:18:08.272 --> 1:18:10.232
I am.

1:18:10.232 --> 1:18:14.069
As I walk through the valley
of the shadow of high school,

1:18:14.069 --> 1:18:17.406
I take with me my memories,
I leave behind my regrets.

1:18:17.406 --> 1:18:20.492
I have loved, lost,
risen, fallen,

1:18:20.492 --> 1:18:22.411
and now I face the beyond.

1:18:22.411 --> 1:18:25.205
May my beatdown inspire those
who still live in fear.

1:18:25.205 --> 1:18:29.293
I am Sid Sandagger,
and I am no longer afraid!

1:18:29.293 --> 1:18:32.004
And I have lived!

1:18:42.806 --> 1:18:45.142
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.

1:18:45.142 --> 1:18:46.560
How does this shit
fucking work?

1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:50.063
That's definitely
not how it works.

1:18:50.063 --> 1:18:53.567
Hey, buddy. How you feel?

1:18:54.818 --> 1:18:56.195
I'm alive?

1:18:56.195 --> 1:18:57.404
Yeah, you're alive.

1:18:57.404 --> 1:19:00.032
I mean,
you look like a Picasso,

1:19:00.032 --> 1:19:02.034
but you're alive.

1:19:06.622 --> 1:19:08.624
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1:19:08.624 --> 1:19:11.001
What happened to your face?

1:19:11.001 --> 1:19:13.837
Oh, um, I think Luna
might've tagged me by accident.

1:19:13.837 --> 1:19:15.297
She is so strong.

1:19:15.297 --> 1:19:18.050
I think it's the low
center of gravity

1:19:18.050 --> 1:19:21.553
- and the rage issues.
- So what happened?

1:19:21.553 --> 1:19:24.181
You went unconscious
pretty quickly,
and then shit went down.

1:19:26.099 --> 1:19:28.393
Coach: Break it up!

1:19:28.393 --> 1:19:30.854
Dad, listen to me!
I'm a dancer!

1:19:30.854 --> 1:19:31.855
What do you mean
you're a dancer?

1:19:31.855 --> 1:19:33.065
Yeah!
You know what else?

1:19:35.234 --> 1:19:37.486
I wanna dance!

1:19:37.486 --> 1:19:38.820
Somebody dance with me!

1:19:38.820 --> 1:19:40.656

carry canes!

1:19:45.661 --> 1:19:47.287
- Oh, fuck.
- You stupid bitch.

1:19:47.287 --> 1:19:51.250
- No, I thought we were bros!
- Motherfucker!

1:19:51.250 --> 1:19:54.461
I'll kill you, you hear me?
I'll fucking kill you, bitch!

1:19:55.587 --> 1:19:57.005
I hope you choke to death!

1:19:57.005 --> 1:19:58.882
I'll protect you.

1:19:58.882 --> 1:20:00.509
Protect yourself, bitch.

1:20:00.509 --> 1:20:02.970
- Make your melon.
- Yes.

1:20:09.560 --> 1:20:11.937
- You fought Chuck for me?
- Yeah, of course, dude.

1:20:11.937 --> 1:20:14.815
You're my best friend.

1:20:14.815 --> 1:20:18.402
I'm never gonna let
some piece of shit
beat the shit out of you.

1:20:18.402 --> 1:20:23.073
- Can you walk?
- Oh, fuck.

1:20:23.073 --> 1:20:25.117
Dude, I haven't even tri-- oh.

1:20:25.117 --> 1:20:26.910
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, no, I think so.

1:20:26.910 --> 1:20:27.911
Fuck!

1:20:30.122 --> 1:20:33.208
