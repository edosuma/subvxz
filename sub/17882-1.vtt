WEBVTT

00:05.380 --> 00:15.557
Breaking In - 1x01
- Pilot -

00:26.568 --> 00:30.739
Hey. I'm here. I have the money.
Shh. Act cool, all right?

00:35.618 --> 00:37.996
Professor Dugan's password is "password"?

00:38.121 --> 00:40.832
Yeah, for a creative writing
teacher, he's not very creative.

00:40.957 --> 00:43.293
Just log in and change
your grade to an "A."

00:43.835 --> 00:45.378
You're the man, Cameron.

00:45.503 --> 00:47.464
So I've been told.

00:54.929 --> 00:57.182
Eagle One returning to the nest.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.272
Have a seat there, champ.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.026
Gah! Who the hell are you?

01:08.151 --> 01:09.778
I'm the guy telling you
to sit your ass down.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.655
That's who I am.
Uh, you know, if you're looking

01:12.781 --> 01:14.657
to score some weed, Rasta Ron
just lives down the hall.

01:14.783 --> 01:18.161
Name's Oz. I own a company
called Contra Security.

01:18.286 --> 01:20.705
This is Melanie, our
team's lovely lock-picker.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.749
You should upgrade to a dead bolt.

01:22.874 --> 01:25.001
And lock your porno drawer.

01:26.711 --> 01:30.173
We test security systems...
homes, business. We do it all.

01:30.298 --> 01:32.300
People hire us to break
into their companies

01:32.425 --> 01:33.760
before the criminals do.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.096
Your museum definitely
needs better security.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.681
But I get why she's a masterpiece.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.557
The woman's got four boobs and no mouth.

01:39.724 --> 01:42.185
Good news, senator.
I managed to secure your e-mail.

01:42.310 --> 01:45.105
Bad news...
Your wife knows you're into dudes.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.565
Well, what does that have to do with me?

01:47.691 --> 01:51.945
Well, the university hired us to
see if we could find any holes

01:52.070 --> 01:53.363
in their computer network.

01:53.488 --> 01:57.075
Guess what we found hiding in
one of those holes... you.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.244
Oh, God.
It's quite genius, actually.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.787
You hacked your way into admissions,

02:00.954 --> 02:03.164
got yourself a full
scholarship, faculty parking,

02:03.289 --> 02:04.207
and somehow managed to get two

02:04.374 --> 02:06.918
rooms all to yourself.
Yeah, I registered as twins.

02:07.085 --> 02:07.836
Equally impressive...

02:07.961 --> 02:09.838
You selling midterms to earn beer money.

02:09.963 --> 02:13.633
Thank you, but... you've got no proof.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.301
Well, you're out of toilet paper

02:15.760 --> 02:18.847
and now the last four pages
of "Chamber of Secrets."

02:19.139 --> 02:20.640
Believe you two have met.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.393
This is Josh Armstrong, my intel man.

02:23.518 --> 02:26.271
Intel? No, that's Duncan.
He's in my French class.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.606
Bonjour.

02:28.898 --> 02:30.150
I'm a transfer student.

02:30.316 --> 02:33.278
Name's Duncan. Duncan Manutts.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.365
Manutts. Damn it!

02:37.490 --> 02:39.659
I got a proposition for ya.

02:39.826 --> 02:43.455
It seems that I am, uh, suddenly
in need of a new intern.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.041
You mean, like, filing and xeroxing?
And hacking into

02:46.166 --> 02:48.126
the world's most impenetrable
security systems.

02:48.251 --> 02:52.672
All right, well, lots to chew
on, but I have to say no.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.592
Do I look like your prom date?

02:55.717 --> 02:57.218
"No" is not an option.

02:57.385 --> 02:58.762
Here's how it's gonna go...

02:58.970 --> 03:01.556
You're either gonna come work for me,

03:01.681 --> 03:03.183
or I'm gonna turn you over to the college,

03:03.350 --> 03:05.060
and you're gonna go to jail.

03:06.144 --> 03:10.440
You a cuddler, Cam? You look cuddly.

03:10.982 --> 03:14.277
I mean, not in jail-y kinda way.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.804
Cookie puss.

03:41.846 --> 03:44.474
Cookie... Puss. Ice cream cake.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.685
Intern's always in charge
of the office birthday,

03:46.810 --> 03:48.436
and there's one on Friday.
Yeah, I know.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.897
- You've been telling me for the
last two weeks, Carol. - Mm.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.526
I'll get to it.
Look, I'm gonna, you know... Okay.

03:55.819 --> 03:58.238
Yo, new. Bam!

03:58.363 --> 04:01.658
Han Solo costume for Dragon Con.
I know you're a fan of the Wars.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.868
You got any interest in being my Chewbacca?

04:05.870 --> 04:07.330
I don't... I don't think so.

04:07.455 --> 04:10.291
What, newbie? A black man can
only play Lando Calrissian?

04:10.417 --> 04:12.002
Is that it? Obama!
No, it's just...

04:12.127 --> 04:14.587
You're setting me up for another
one of your office pranks.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.339
My desk?

04:18.716 --> 04:20.510
Who the hell...

04:21.052 --> 04:22.804
Boom goes the dynamite!

04:24.472 --> 04:26.057
I'm serious, my wookiee.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.685
Think about it while I get my shunky on.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.271
We have a team meeting.
We don't have time for candy.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.564
You're gonna have to wait.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.941
My mouth is about to have
sex with this candy bar.

04:35.066 --> 04:39.529
Ooh, girl! Ooh, what?
Give me some of that fine sugar. Mmm!

04:40.030 --> 04:42.907
Ooh, yeah.
That really doesn't look consensual.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.785
She's over 18, so, you know...
Hmm?

04:45.952 --> 04:47.162
Mayfair Motors...

04:47.287 --> 04:49.914
They specialize in Ferraris, Lamborghinis,

04:50.081 --> 04:52.292
your basic 4-wheel, Italian panty-droppers.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.835
The dealership wants to make sure that

04:54.002 --> 04:55.962
their security's impenetrable,
so they've hired us to see

04:56.087 --> 04:57.672
if we can get in there,
steal one of their cars

04:57.797 --> 05:00.091
off the showroom floor.
It's go time, people.

05:00.216 --> 05:01.426
Team leader needs to bring the heat!

05:01.551 --> 05:04.929
That's good because I am flaming.

05:05.597 --> 05:09.392
As much as I appreciate
the, uh, razzmatazz,

05:09.517 --> 05:13.521
I'm going with eeny, meeny, miny, you.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.815
Me? Uh, I don't know the first thing

05:15.940 --> 05:18.276
about stealing a car.
You spend all day in your cubicle

05:18.401 --> 05:20.195
playing "Grand Theft Auto."
You should be fine.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.237
It's a video game.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.073
It doesn't mean I know
how to kill prostitutes.

05:23.198 --> 05:24.657
I gotta take this. I'm closing

05:24.783 --> 05:27.702
that security contract for the
airport in Vizplazikstan.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.413
Is that a country?
Not yet, but if all goes according to plan,

05:30.538 --> 05:33.750
it will be in ten months.
Hey! Bahut bahut shukriya.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.628
Phir milaiyin ge.
Was he speaking "Avatar"?

05:36.753 --> 05:39.464
I know it's not Klingon,
'cause I speak that fluently.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.842
Hey, found your scissors, college boy.

05:42.967 --> 05:45.053
You know, so you can stab 'em in my back.

05:45.220 --> 05:47.097
Yeah, I'll aim for your
girlie butterfly tattoo.

05:47.222 --> 05:51.810
It's a dragonfly, and the chicks dig it.

05:52.268 --> 05:55.939
Oh, my God.
We have the same butterfly tattoo.

05:58.149 --> 06:00.694
I am top dog in this office.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.946
The Mayfield Motors job was mine.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.989
Great. And you can have it.
I have to study for midterms.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.991
I was gonna go tell Oz
to put you in charge.

06:07.117 --> 06:10.036
Oh. So that's how you're gonna play it.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.538
No, you're clearly the best,

06:11.663 --> 06:14.624
and I'm in no way debating that.
You know what this is?

06:15.625 --> 06:17.210
It's a gun rack.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.630
Watch yourself.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.844
Hey, Cam the man, come on in.
Hey, listen, uh...

06:25.969 --> 06:27.429
Got some fantastic news.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.724
My personalized B.B.Q. branding iron
just arrived.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.851
Lord, I love Skymall.

06:33.018 --> 06:35.353
It's like a mall, but in the sky.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.273
Got a bunch of stuff on the
plane ride to Dubai last night.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.275
Dubai? Weren't you here last night?

06:40.400 --> 06:42.902
I was, until I went to Dubai.

06:43.028 --> 06:43.570
Goober?

06:43.695 --> 06:46.197
Uh, yeah. Thanks.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.909
Whoa! Looks just like Kirk's
chair from "Star Trek"!

06:50.035 --> 06:52.454
It is. Shatner gave it to us
when we helped secure his home

06:52.579 --> 06:55.415
from a fanboy stalker.
That's how we met cash.

06:55.707 --> 06:58.501
Captain Kirk, it's me again.

06:58.626 --> 07:00.503
Did you get my friend request?

07:00.628 --> 07:01.921
You gon' beam me up?

07:02.088 --> 07:04.758
Beam me up.
Not today, ensign psycho.

07:04.924 --> 07:05.967
Beam a brother up!

07:07.052 --> 07:08.094
Get up!

07:08.219 --> 07:09.846
Only team leader gets to sit in the chair,

07:09.971 --> 07:12.515
and you're here to bail on the carjacking.
It's only because I...

07:12.640 --> 07:13.516
You'd rather stay in college

07:13.641 --> 07:16.019
where you're king pimp?
Kinda. And I just...

07:16.186 --> 07:17.604
Afraid that working for me means popping

07:17.729 --> 07:18.605
your safe little college

07:18.772 --> 07:21.358
bubble and entering the real world?
How are you...

07:21.483 --> 07:23.985
Doing that? I'm in your head.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.196
Look, stealing a car was
never part of the deal.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.697
The deal's what I say it is.

07:27.822 --> 07:28.740
Unless you'd like to pay

07:28.865 --> 07:30.992
back your college tuition right now.
No. I...

07:31.409 --> 07:33.912
Yikes! Seven years. That's pretty pricey.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.081
$350,000? That's...
I'll just...

07:36.206 --> 07:38.208
I'll disappear. I'll go off the grid.

07:38.416 --> 07:41.836
This grid? That goober you
ate was a tracking device.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.506
Looks to me like you're no longer
the smartest kid in class, Cam.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.341
I'd like a silver Lamborghini, please.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.635
Oh, and, uh, get that cookie
puss and one of those

07:48.802 --> 07:51.346
giant novelty cards.
They're funny 'cause they're big.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.724
So you just met with Oz.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.476
Yes.
And you ate a goober.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.144
Yes.
So you're still our team leader.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.438
Yes, and I don't understand why
he's putting me in charge.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.066
Well, you'll never know.
Oz always has a plan.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.567
Well, my plan was to stay in college

08:04.693 --> 08:05.902
until I die of happiness.
Well,

08:06.027 --> 08:07.612
I think you should give
this place a chance.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.906
I think you'll find we're
pretty good people here.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.755
And... boom! Goes the dynamite.

08:25.964 --> 08:28.299
Sorry, but gotta haze the new guy.

08:28.466 --> 08:29.718
That's how every office works.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.219
No. No, that's how this office works.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.346
In the real world, it's a felony.

08:34.139 --> 08:37.100
You want a ride home?
Yeah, that'd be great. Can you do that?

08:37.225 --> 08:38.559
I got you.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.563
You may want to move it, though.
They tow on Tuesdays.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.026
You're late, Kirk Cameron.

08:46.192 --> 08:46.901
Yeah, 'cause cash keeps

08:47.068 --> 08:49.821
pranking me and ruining my life.
I'll allow it.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.615
Oh, come on, newbie, Tuesdays?

08:52.741 --> 08:55.243
You can't hate on a guy for
pulling a little office prank.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.995
A little office prank
is xeroxing your butt.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.998
You have 161 I.Q.
You don't know how to do little.

09:08.340 --> 09:11.051
You my boy, okay, the Chewie to my Solo.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.553
Let me explain how this works.
Prank a brother back.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.097
Earn my respect, and the hazing stops.
It's not rush week.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.599
I have to break into a car dealership

09:17.724 --> 09:20.310
and bust out of this job.
And buy a cake.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.270
And buy a cake.

09:23.188 --> 09:24.647
Come to papa.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.358
No. No, no, no, no.

09:26.483 --> 09:27.942
Team meeting in ten.

09:28.735 --> 09:32.364
So you want to dance. Let's dance.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.740
So let me get this straight...

09:33.865 --> 09:36.201
You gathered us all here
in your douche-icle

09:36.326 --> 09:39.079
so you could tell us you have no
idea what the hell you're doing.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.915
Look, I'm team leader, all right?
So listen up.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.292
Cash, uh, can you plot our
route to the car? Cool?

09:44.417 --> 09:45.752
Yeah, I'll work on it.

09:45.877 --> 09:48.630
First, I gotta get me that shunky.
Bernice in accounting?

09:48.755 --> 09:50.799
Chocolate bar. But for the record...

09:50.924 --> 09:53.760
Tempted ?
Okay.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.929
Uh, Josh, I'll leave the intel up to you.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.639
Think you can smooth-talk the receptionist?

09:57.764 --> 09:59.849
I don't have time to rob Mayfield Motors.

09:59.974 --> 10:03.520
I've got three dates tonight.
How is that even possible?

10:03.645 --> 10:06.231
Don't call me. I'll be multi-assing.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.733
Peace. This meeting's adjourned, right?

10:10.151 --> 10:12.278
Now let's go crack a safe.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.075
You're really good at this stuff.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.744
Well, people always expected
me to do beauty pageants

10:19.869 --> 10:21.162
and bake cookies and all that crap,

10:21.329 --> 10:23.289
but I kinda went the other way.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.584
So... talk to me, Goose.
What's your deal, huh?

10:26.710 --> 10:29.629
Gotta be more to you than
pimp parties and beer bongs.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.798
No, I'm just your average
27-year-old college student

10:31.965 --> 10:33.967
with 12 majors, living the dream.
Really?

10:34.134 --> 10:36.511
So how long you think
that dream's gonna last?

10:36.678 --> 10:37.595
Probably another ten years,

10:37.721 --> 10:39.139
and then I'll hack my way into grad school.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.265
Sounds like a great plan.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.726
Trust me, college is heaven
compared to how I grew up.

10:46.104 --> 10:51.109
Coccyx.
The spelling is c-o-c...

10:55.321 --> 10:57.032
No one's gonna pants you here.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.035
No, just, uh, cement my
desk to the ceiling.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.911
Let's not forget the crazy
man with the pitching wedge

11:02.037 --> 11:03.663
blackmailing me to steal a car.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.540
Well, you do realize that's all happening

11:05.665 --> 11:07.792
because we like you, right?

11:08.335 --> 11:10.045
Hey, listen, you want to maybe grab...

11:15.091 --> 11:16.217
Dutch!

11:17.052 --> 11:19.554
Get over here and give
Papa Smurf some sugar.

11:20.597 --> 11:24.601
Oh! Cam, this is my boyfriend Dutch.
What's up?

11:24.726 --> 11:27.687
Hey, you look smart.
Can I have some urine?

11:27.937 --> 11:29.022
Ex-excuse me?

11:29.147 --> 11:30.940
Yeah, Dutch sells clean urine on eBay

11:31.066 --> 11:32.984
so people can pass their drug tests.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.028
Huh? Sounds... illegal.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.571
Ah, it's a moral gray area,

11:36.696 --> 11:39.199
but it's totally paid for
gold thunder over there.

11:39.324 --> 11:40.575
Yeah. No, it's really cool, dude.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.493
Come with the racing stripe?

11:41.659 --> 11:44.579
Why don't you ask your
underpants that question? Face!

11:45.246 --> 11:46.748
I'm calling you about that nerd pee,

11:46.915 --> 11:50.669
all right, my man? Hey.
Got you a little somethin' somethin'.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.879
What is this?
I've taken a matchbook

11:53.004 --> 11:55.340
from every restaurant we've ever been to.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.008
Look, I know you moved
around a lot as a kid,

11:57.133 --> 12:02.597
so I want you to feel like you
always have a home, in my arms.

12:04.432 --> 12:05.767
It's highly flammable.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.228
I love the crap out of this woman!

12:09.729 --> 12:13.149
My God. I mean, usually my
boyfriends are such tools,

12:13.274 --> 12:14.150
but Dutch...

12:14.317 --> 12:15.652
He's... not.

12:15.777 --> 12:18.655
I mean, he's really made
this the best birthday ever.

12:18.822 --> 12:21.408
It's... it's your birthday?
Yeah.

12:21.533 --> 12:24.869
I'm on cake duty.
Okay, anything but a cookie puss.

12:24.994 --> 12:25.829
I'm lactose-intolerant.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.247
Yeah, me, too.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.208
Me, too.

12:37.549 --> 12:38.842
Hey, buttercup.

12:39.009 --> 12:40.510
Nowhere on that computer screen

12:40.677 --> 12:42.804
do I see the words "lamb" or "ghini."

12:42.929 --> 12:45.056
Looks like you're hacking Mel's life.
What gives?

12:45.181 --> 12:46.516
The least I could do is
get her the perfect cake,

12:46.683 --> 12:49.602
right? Take a piece of
advice from the boss man.

12:49.728 --> 12:52.981
Melanie's our safecracker
because that chick is wild.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.274
How wild we talkin'?

12:57.360 --> 12:58.695
You bought a bike?

12:58.820 --> 13:00.947
Nope.
Cool.

13:01.156 --> 13:05.285
Trust me. That's one roller
coaster you do not want to ride.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.120
Now holster your pistol there, quick draw.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.788
I need you to focus on what's important.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.250
All right, here's the plan.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.835
I'll walk you through
it in 30 short minutes.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.879
You have 60 seconds. Go.

13:16.504 --> 13:19.090
Uh, oh... Webster's defines "security"

13:19.215 --> 13:22.385
as "the quality or state of being"...
55 seconds.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.220
Skip the preamble.
Right. Okay.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.805
The plan starts with our intel man Josh.

13:25.930 --> 13:29.768
Josh will pose as a prospective buyer.
I have 20 car,

13:29.893 --> 13:32.604
but this could be good 21st.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.648
Would you be so kind as to
print travel itinerary?

13:35.774 --> 13:38.026
I have jet to take to Prague.
It's no big deal.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.527
Oh, absolutely, Baron.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.029
The U.S.B. will install a back door

13:41.154 --> 13:42.447
onto their network so I can then shut down

13:42.572 --> 13:44.491
their exterior alarms.

13:48.703 --> 13:51.039
You got 45 seconds.
Go. Move. Move.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.250
Once we're in, we'll have to
deactivate a series of lasers.

13:58.129 --> 14:00.632
Let's light up the "falcon."
Go. Go. Go. Move.

14:09.015 --> 14:12.560
Cam, watch those lasers.
We hit a beam, and we're done.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.816
Okay, Cam, bank left.

14:22.028 --> 14:25.031
Dock the bird, Cam.
Steady. Steady.

14:29.953 --> 14:31.121
Yes!

14:31.287 --> 14:32.831
Car keys are kept in a multi-lock safe.

14:32.998 --> 14:34.457
That's all Melanie.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.089
All right, subside.
What you got for me, huh?

14:41.256 --> 14:43.091
Silver Lamborghini, as requested.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.551
In and out in five minutes flat.

14:44.676 --> 14:47.053
I believe that's our first.
Yeah!

14:47.303 --> 14:49.097
Yes, it is.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.016
You were supposed to...

14:51.307 --> 14:53.810
Steal a car from Mayfair Motors.

14:53.935 --> 14:55.228
This car...

14:56.312 --> 14:59.566
Is from Mayfield motors!

15:00.859 --> 15:04.029
We... stole the wrong car?

15:04.195 --> 15:06.865
You stole the wrong car, sweetheart.

15:15.497 --> 15:17.040
Missed you at work today.

15:17.207 --> 15:19.000
I've still got a stolen car in my garage,

15:19.125 --> 15:22.462
and someone needs to fix that.
Do it yourself.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.841
Oopsy Daisy.
Looks like someone broke your toy!

15:27.968 --> 15:30.220
That was so uncool.

15:30.345 --> 15:31.304
You know what else isn't cool?

15:31.429 --> 15:33.807
Sitting in your home, where
it's all safe and cozy.

15:33.932 --> 15:36.268
Life is about either
trying to dodge a bullet

15:36.393 --> 15:37.936
or hit a bull's-eye, and trust me, kid,

15:38.061 --> 15:41.523
this job is the bull's-eye.
But why me?

15:44.025 --> 15:46.069
I used to be a thief...

15:46.194 --> 15:48.321
Counterfeiting, breaking and entering.

15:48.446 --> 15:50.740
I spent my 21st birthday
in jail for that one.

15:50.866 --> 15:53.034
That's why they call you "Oz,"
after that prison show

15:53.201 --> 15:55.620
with male frontal nudity
and adult situations?

15:55.745 --> 16:00.292
Or my last name is Osbourne.
That also makes sense.

16:00.458 --> 16:03.753
Point is, I can't be caught
anywhere near a hot car.

16:03.879 --> 16:06.089
I've got an ex-wife and
kids looking for any excuse

16:06.214 --> 16:07.340
to cut me out of their lives.

16:07.465 --> 16:09.176
I can't help you with that car.
Josh was right.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.886
I really suck at this job.
Don't let

16:11.011 --> 16:13.847
that man get into your head.
He can manipulate anyone.

16:14.097 --> 16:16.224
I don't have time to rob Mayfield Motors.

16:16.349 --> 16:18.560
The Mayfield Motors job was mine.
Hey,

16:18.685 --> 16:20.812
do you need any help with
the Mayfield Motors job?

16:21.104 --> 16:24.566
That floppy-haired son of a bitch!

16:25.442 --> 16:27.611
Hey, Josh, I was wondering if maybe, uh...

16:27.736 --> 16:30.780
Oh, dude! That's Armani!
I know it was you, Josh.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.616
You got in my head and made
me steal the wrong car.

16:32.741 --> 16:35.827
In my defense, you fell for it.

16:35.952 --> 16:37.412
Oz, help.

16:38.788 --> 16:41.166
I'll allow it. Boop.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.084
All right, here's the deal.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.712
You have to help me put back the hot car

16:45.837 --> 16:47.088
and steal the right one.

16:47.214 --> 16:51.009
Help you? I despise you.
You know, before you showed up,

16:51.176 --> 16:54.095
I was Oz's golden boy.
Listen, I didn't want any of this.

16:54.221 --> 16:57.807
Exactly. You don't even want to be here.

16:58.391 --> 17:01.144
Look, if you help me fix this,

17:01.311 --> 17:03.855
there's a chance Oz would let me go.
Then we both win.

17:03.980 --> 17:06.441
Fix it how? The dealership's
gonna be crawling with cops.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.652
It's impossible.
It'll be a piece of cake.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.403
Not now, please, God.

17:10.529 --> 17:11.738
Okay.

17:12.989 --> 17:15.742
This idiot's Eddie Gold.
His dad owns Mayfield Motors.

17:15.867 --> 17:16.952
I hacked into his Flickr account,

17:17.117 --> 17:19.621
found out he's a frat boy at State.

17:22.457 --> 17:25.919
You're not my weed dealer.
'Sup, frat daddy. Name's Weezer.

17:26.044 --> 17:28.128
I'm a Beta Pi over at Kansas U.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.507
I was on a little frat-cation when I had

17:30.632 --> 17:33.718
a total frat-astrophe.
Stop saying "frat."

17:33.885 --> 17:35.595
Any-rape, I was wondering

17:35.762 --> 17:38.849
if maybe I could crash here for the night.
Depends.

17:39.015 --> 17:42.227
If you really are a Beta,
what's the secret handshake?

17:42.394 --> 17:43.186
Our handshake.
My favorite...

17:43.311 --> 17:45.814
Uh, wait. Hold on. Just stall him.
Part about being in a frat.

17:45.939 --> 17:46.523
All right, got it.

17:46.648 --> 17:50.610
It's, uh, fist bump, fist bump,

17:51.027 --> 17:53.321
pinkie lock, patty cake,

17:53.572 --> 17:54.990
ass smack,

17:55.240 --> 17:57.409
cabbage patch to double high-five.

17:57.909 --> 18:00.370
Bro! Ho ho ho ho! Bro!

18:00.537 --> 18:02.497
Bro! Get your beta butt in here.

18:02.622 --> 18:03.373
Let's play some beer pong.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.334
Actually, I was thinking more tequila pong?

18:06.459 --> 18:07.961
Nasty!

18:10.714 --> 18:13.425
You know, I never thought I'd say this,

18:13.592 --> 18:15.218
but we really make a good team.

18:15.343 --> 18:17.220
You know, that's so funny,

18:17.387 --> 18:21.308
'cause I was about to say, suck it.
We'll never be a team.

18:22.809 --> 18:25.478
Hey, you stole this car, man.

18:25.645 --> 18:28.398
I stole this car?
You stole this car.

18:29.107 --> 18:31.193
I stole this car!

18:32.485 --> 18:33.570
Edward!

18:33.695 --> 18:35.655
Dad?
Hey.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.158
You wanna get tacos?

18:38.491 --> 18:42.287
Okay, so we returned the stolen car.
Whoop-dee-do.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.998
You still can't get the car
you were supposed to grab.

18:45.165 --> 18:48.919
Face it, college boy, you're boned.

18:55.675 --> 18:58.929
You know, they should
really have a gate here.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.977
Josh, go! Go get the keys!

19:13.360 --> 19:16.112
"It's your birthday... ...Go bananas."

19:16.613 --> 19:18.448
That's a big card.

19:18.657 --> 19:21.326
You pulled it off.
Never doubted you for a second.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.869
You had a lot riding on this.

19:22.994 --> 19:25.330
The last thing I wanted was
for you to go back to jail.

19:25.455 --> 19:27.123
I never went to jail.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.669
You said when you were 21, you...
When I was 21, I went to Yale.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.671
Guess you heard that wrong.

19:34.297 --> 19:37.634
You totally manipulated me.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.845
I'll allow it.

20:30.812 --> 20:31.646
Hey.

20:31.771 --> 20:32.939
Hey.

20:33.148 --> 20:34.524
Happy Birthday.

20:37.110 --> 20:39.654
And you got the underpants on that one.

20:51.708 --> 20:53.710
Who the hell put a pin up in the...

20:53.835 --> 20:56.880
Boom goes the dynamite.

20:59.007 --> 21:01.218
Newbie.
