00:00.935 --> 00:02.368
<i>You're watching</i>
The Grinder.

00:02.370 --> 00:05.104
-For justice?
-For justice!

00:14.382 --> 00:15.748
<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:18.986 --> 00:20.019
MAN:
Grinder, no!

00:20.021 --> 00:20.986
Call Lieutenant Governor Shaw!

00:20.988 --> 00:22.054
We are putting him on the stand!

00:22.056 --> 00:24.189
MAN:
You can't do that, Grinder!

00:24.191 --> 00:25.524
It's too risky!

00:25.526 --> 00:27.059
Maybe you didn't
get the memo, Pincus.

00:27.061 --> 00:28.460
Too risky is not
in my vocabulary.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.295
Well, it's in mine!

00:30.297 --> 00:32.798
You do this,

00:32.800 --> 00:35.467
you put the whole firm
in jeopardy.

00:35.469 --> 00:38.337
Possibly even our lives.

00:38.339 --> 00:39.805
Stand down, Pincus.

00:41.008 --> 00:43.842
I said stand down

00:43.844 --> 00:46.879
or I will stand you down myself!

00:51.085 --> 00:53.152
You'll be disbarred, Mitch.

00:54.989 --> 00:57.222
Such a strong pilot, Uncle Dean.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.391
Right? But I want to show you
the second episode.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.759
Uh, you know what, Dean,
it's, uh, it's almost 10:00.

01:00.761 --> 01:01.860
I think we should
wrap this up.

01:01.862 --> 01:02.895
Ethan's got to get to bed.

01:02.897 --> 01:04.396
Dad, this is a big episode.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.331
They have to reset
the whole premise.

01:06.333 --> 01:07.433
And that's a hard thing to do.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.534
In a graceful way?

01:08.536 --> 01:09.935
Very difficult.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.570
And we didn't
follow up the pilot

01:11.572 --> 01:13.038
as well as we should've,
and you know what?

01:13.040 --> 01:15.507
We lost a lot of our audience
because of it.

01:15.509 --> 01:16.608
Are we sure that's why?
How about this?

01:16.610 --> 01:18.911
We watch one more-- two tops--

01:18.913 --> 01:20.579
then we call it.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.114
Okay, one more and then bed.

01:22.116 --> 01:24.450
All right? I got to get
to work in the morning.

01:24.452 --> 01:27.019
That reminds me--
tomorrow, should we carpool?

01:27.021 --> 01:28.120
Or is it the kind of thing

01:28.122 --> 01:28.954
where you take the first half

01:28.956 --> 01:29.955
of the day
and I take the second?

01:29.957 --> 01:31.190
So-so you're planning on

01:31.192 --> 01:32.458
coming into the office?

01:32.460 --> 01:34.460
Like, every day now?

01:34.462 --> 01:35.861
Yeah. Oh, were you thinking

01:35.863 --> 01:37.396
I was just gonna
work out of the house?

01:37.398 --> 01:38.797
No, uh, I was not...

01:38.799 --> 01:40.399
I was not thinking that, Dean,

01:40.401 --> 01:43.769
because, um,
you're not... a lawyer.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.270
Well, not yet.
What do you
expect him to do?

01:45.272 --> 01:47.072
Show's over--
he's got to do something.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.707
Okay, so we've moved past
the whole just because he was

01:48.709 --> 01:49.908
a lawyer on TV
doesn't make him qualified

01:49.910 --> 01:51.210
to do it in real life argument?

01:51.212 --> 01:52.711
BOTH: Yeah.
Yeah, I believe we are.

01:52.713 --> 01:53.712
That ship has sailed.

01:53.714 --> 01:54.947
That's ridiculous.

01:54.949 --> 01:56.715
It's a family law firm!

01:56.717 --> 01:59.051
All of us working together.

01:59.053 --> 02:00.385
Don't deprive me of that.

02:00.387 --> 02:02.254
I vote carpool,
'cause that way we get

02:02.256 --> 02:03.388
to spend some time together.

02:03.390 --> 02:04.623
Beginning of the day.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.959
And the end of the day.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.594
Yeah.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.629
Okay.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.931
All right,
let's cue this bitch up.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.066
Episode two!

02:21.008 --> 02:22.274
Happy Monday, everyone.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.109
Good win last week.

02:24.111 --> 02:26.145
Even though it was a trial
that made zero financial sense,

02:26.147 --> 02:27.846
it's nice to know
that the Ramirezes

02:27.848 --> 02:28.981
get to keep their apartment.

02:28.983 --> 02:30.649
Justice has no price.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.817
Well...

02:31.819 --> 02:33.485
there is some price, Todd.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.621
It's 40 hours
we bill to no one.

02:35.623 --> 02:36.855
Oh, right.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.023
Stew, don't be
a stick in the mud.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.092
We got a ton
of free publicity,

02:40.094 --> 02:41.627
and we've been flooded
with new business.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.028
Which is both good and bad.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.130
With new business
comes more work.

02:45.132 --> 02:46.298
And I think we
should consider

02:46.300 --> 02:47.799
bringing on a new attorney

02:47.801 --> 02:49.001
if we're gonna take on
all these cases.

02:49.003 --> 02:50.602
Yeah, but do we feel

02:50.604 --> 02:52.037
like taking on all these cases?

02:52.039 --> 02:53.872
He's leaning
in the doorway, right?

02:53.874 --> 02:55.140
'Cause I got to tell you,

02:55.142 --> 02:56.441
none of them
are grabbing me.

02:56.443 --> 02:57.976
We need to follow up

02:57.978 --> 02:59.645
on this Ramirez victory
with something really special.

02:59.647 --> 03:00.979
Okay, great, Dean.

03:00.981 --> 03:03.515
And how exactly do you
suggest we do that?

03:03.517 --> 03:06.018
He's saying we have to choose
a case that speaks to us.

03:06.020 --> 03:06.985
DEAN:
Well, no, no, no!

03:06.987 --> 03:08.654
We don't choose anything.

03:08.656 --> 03:12.191
We let the case choose us.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.358
That's insane!

03:13.360 --> 03:14.793
If we throw away
all these cases,

03:14.795 --> 03:16.128
we will go out of business.

03:16.130 --> 03:18.363
Okay?

03:18.365 --> 03:19.565
This-this is a real law firm.

03:19.567 --> 03:20.666
We can't do that.

03:20.668 --> 03:24.069
But what if we could?

03:27.241 --> 03:29.975
But we can't.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.077
But what if we could?

03:32.079 --> 03:34.546
I don't know
how to respond to that...

03:34.548 --> 03:36.148
exactly.

03:36.150 --> 03:36.915
STEWART:
<i> Lizzie, no texting.</i>

03:36.917 --> 03:38.150
We're eating dinner.

03:38.152 --> 03:39.351
Just one text.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.719
DEBBIE:
Just let her shoot one text.

03:40.721 --> 03:41.887
No, no texts!
We're eating.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.155
And that better not be
Joel Zadak.

03:43.157 --> 03:43.922
Why?

03:43.924 --> 03:44.990
What do you have against him?

03:44.992 --> 03:46.558
Aw, this is great.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.726
We're eating.
We're passing things.

03:47.728 --> 03:48.894
We're arguing about texting.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.028
We don't like Zadak.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.096
It's all here.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.364
This is the stuff.

03:52.366 --> 03:53.365
It really is.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.366
Dinner.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.901
It's amazing.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.536
Hey, Ethan,
you finish your homework?

03:57.538 --> 03:58.937
Can I do it in the morning?
I'm exhausted.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.073
No, sir.
The only reason you're exhausted

04:01.075 --> 04:02.374
is 'cause you stayed up all
night with your uncle watching

04:02.376 --> 04:03.508
<i> The Grinder; </i>
I don't want to hear it.

04:03.510 --> 04:04.943
You're gonna do it tonight.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.445
Hey, exhausted brain

04:06.447 --> 04:08.247
is a worthless brain;
you got to let it work

04:08.249 --> 04:09.681
when it wants to work.
For me, my best stuff

04:09.683 --> 04:10.682
comes out in the middle
of the night.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.284
That lines up for me.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.352
That does not
line up for you, okay?

04:13.354 --> 04:14.553
You're not gonna do that.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.188
DEBBIE:
Here's something crazy.

04:16.190 --> 04:19.057
Dawn and Trevor got fired.
Really? What for?

04:19.059 --> 04:20.225
Who-who are Dawn and Trevor?
Fill me in.

04:20.227 --> 04:21.860
Well, they're friends of ours

04:21.862 --> 04:22.961
and they work together
and I guess their boss

04:22.963 --> 04:23.962
found found out
that they were dating,

04:23.964 --> 04:24.963
which he doesn't allow.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.465
Wait a minute.

04:26.467 --> 04:29.067
And they were fired
because of it?

04:29.069 --> 04:31.703
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Zero chance.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.307
No one,

04:35.309 --> 04:37.776
and I mean no one,

04:37.778 --> 04:40.312
should be able
to tell someone

04:40.314 --> 04:43.081
who they can and cannot love.

04:43.083 --> 04:43.915
So true.

04:43.917 --> 04:44.983
It's not that true.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.118
Wh-Where are you going?

04:46.120 --> 04:47.386
Where's he going? Where's...

04:47.388 --> 04:49.621
Uh, if it's your company,

04:49.623 --> 04:51.056
you-you can make that policy.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.391
It's perfectly legal.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.392
What are you thinking, Junior?

04:53.394 --> 04:54.793
We go to Dawn and Trevor

04:54.795 --> 04:55.927
and see if they want to sue?

04:55.929 --> 04:57.996
Wait, I-I don't
want to sue.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.398
Oh, oh, I don't want to sue,
he doesn't want to sue,

04:59.400 --> 05:00.832
nobody wants to sue,

05:00.834 --> 05:02.801
but I think the question
we're facing

05:02.803 --> 05:04.569
is don't we<i> have</i> to sue?

05:04.571 --> 05:05.971
Not at all.
Yeah, we do.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.140
We would be representing love.

05:08.142 --> 05:10.642
And their constitutional right
to have it.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.778
And to share it
with whomever

05:12.780 --> 05:14.012
and wherever.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.247
This is our case.

05:15.249 --> 05:18.083
You were right, Deano--
the case found us.

05:18.085 --> 05:18.917
But this isn't a case at all.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.285
There's nothing here.

05:20.287 --> 05:23.355
But what if there was?

05:26.760 --> 05:29.094
STEWART:
Guys, I can hear the gavel sound
from downstairs!

05:29.096 --> 05:30.696
I can't believe
you're watching this again.

05:30.698 --> 05:31.930
Have you finished your homework?

05:31.932 --> 05:34.199
My head's just
not there right now,

05:34.201 --> 05:35.634
so I'm gonna give

05:35.636 --> 05:37.536
3:00 a.m. a try
like Uncle Dean said.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.004
What? No, come on, homework.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.039
And, Lizzie,
that better not be Joel Zadak.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.341
Come on, okay?
He and I are a couple.

05:42.343 --> 05:44.042
And like Uncle Dean said...

05:44.044 --> 05:45.644
I don't care
what Uncle Dean said.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.279
The answer is no...
PINCUS: No, Grinder!

05:47.281 --> 05:49.114
The answer is no!

05:49.116 --> 05:50.449
I don't want
to hear it, Pincus.

05:50.451 --> 05:53.051
You're flying too close
to the sun, Grinder!

05:53.053 --> 05:54.519
It's not gonna work.
It's damn near impossible!

05:54.521 --> 05:56.121
Don't ever

05:56.123 --> 05:58.623
tell me what's impossible!

05:58.625 --> 05:59.891
PINCUS:
Well, someone's got to.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.460
And whether I like it or not,

06:01.462 --> 06:04.296
that someone's me.
You can't win, Mitch.

06:04.298 --> 06:06.231
Well, that's the difference
between you and I, Pincus.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.633
I never...

06:08.635 --> 06:10.369
can't win.

06:15.376 --> 06:18.210
I'm friggin' Pincus.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.650
Grinder, you are jeopardizing

06:25.652 --> 06:26.918
the entire firm!

06:26.920 --> 06:29.020
We will lose
everything we built!

06:29.022 --> 06:30.389
Everything!

06:30.391 --> 06:31.890
I'm scared, Mitch.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.325
You'll be disbarred, Mitch.

06:33.327 --> 06:36.094
Please, don't do this!
I am telling you

06:36.096 --> 06:38.530
you will lose!

06:38.532 --> 06:39.898
(knocking)

06:39.900 --> 06:41.600
Hey, I got to go to work.

06:41.602 --> 06:42.768
Can you take the kids?

06:42.770 --> 06:43.602
Uh, yeah.

06:43.604 --> 06:44.903
What are you watching

06:44.905 --> 06:47.939
by yourself in the bathroom
at 8:00 a.m.?

06:47.941 --> 06:49.408
Am I really negative?

06:49.410 --> 06:53.044
Like, am I a negative person,
like a naysayer?

06:53.046 --> 06:54.279
I don't think so, why?

06:54.281 --> 06:56.415
I don't know, I just...

06:56.417 --> 06:58.016
You know what?
I feel like when Dean's here,

06:58.018 --> 06:59.918
I-I'm just, I'm always
saying no to everything.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.021
You know, like I'm-I'm some
sad sack buzzkill.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.424
Oh, come on, you are
not a sad sack buzzkill.

07:05.426 --> 07:08.026
You're...

07:08.028 --> 07:09.261
levelheaded.

07:09.263 --> 07:10.929
So, boring?
No.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.931
Conservative or...

07:12.933 --> 07:14.933
realistic.

07:14.935 --> 07:15.934
Those are both worse.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.602
Even with the hands.

07:17.604 --> 07:18.804
But it's a good thing.

07:18.806 --> 07:19.871
It's who you are.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.206
But what if it wasn't?

07:21.208 --> 07:22.808
Okay.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.776
I have to go to work now.
Right?

07:24.778 --> 07:26.044
It's impossible to argue!

07:26.046 --> 07:27.712
You can use it in any situation,

07:27.714 --> 07:29.781
because it just, it means
nothing, honey!
Love you.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.083
So, sometimes you take them

07:32.085 --> 07:33.952
and sometimes Deb takes them?

07:33.954 --> 07:36.655
Yeah, uh, whatever,

07:36.657 --> 07:38.123
whatever works out best
for our schedules.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.558
That is a great arrangement.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.993
Uh-huh. Ethan, you tired?

07:41.995 --> 07:43.228
Yeah, a little.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.130
But it's worth it.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.732
Amazing how much you can get
done in the middle of the night

07:47.734 --> 07:49.434
without all the distractions.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.670
Right?

07:51.672 --> 07:53.238
Sure.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.007
If it... if it works,
it works, I guess.

07:56.009 --> 07:56.942
Whoa, who's this guy?

07:56.944 --> 07:58.410
Still the same guy,

07:58.412 --> 08:00.245
just... trying to be
a little more open.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.314
Really? Then can I have
Zadak over?

08:02.316 --> 08:03.782
You open to that?

08:03.784 --> 08:06.284
You know what? I am.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.919
I am.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.087
Have him over.
Have him over.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.489
Thank you.
Yeah.

08:10.491 --> 08:11.990
Yeah.

08:11.992 --> 08:15.026
These are the moments.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.430
DEAN SR.:
<i> Deano, I want you to meet</i>

08:18.432 --> 08:20.165
our new clients,
Trevor and Dawn.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.133
Hi. How are you?
TREVOR: Hi.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.169
I was so inspired
by Deano last night

08:24.171 --> 08:26.037
that I just decided
to take action.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.439
When I heard
from my sister-in-law

08:27.441 --> 08:29.674
about your egregious
termination,

08:29.676 --> 08:31.209
I was appalled.
DAWN:
I'm sorry.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.011
I didn't hear a word
you just said.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.379
I'm such a huge fan.

08:34.381 --> 08:35.547
TREVOR:
And, dude, love the show.

08:35.549 --> 08:36.982
But watching you take down

08:36.984 --> 08:38.383
Albert Krantz
in that eviction case,

08:38.385 --> 08:39.784
that was sick.

08:39.786 --> 08:41.386
It was a tremendous
legal victory.

08:41.388 --> 08:42.954
But you know what, that is
all in the rearview mirror,

08:42.956 --> 08:45.390
because there's
more justice to be had.

08:45.392 --> 08:48.059
And it begins right here today
with the two of you.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.161
Isn't that right, Stew?

08:50.163 --> 08:52.497
Yes.

08:52.499 --> 08:54.032
Yes, it does.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.534
I'm excited about this.

08:56.670 --> 08:59.070
Justice begins here.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.009
Talk to me.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.678
STEWART:
Opposing counsel
is Rozz/Landy & Associates.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.813
Led by Hugh Rozz
and Pat Landy.

09:08.815 --> 09:09.981
They any good?

09:09.983 --> 09:11.249
Put it this way--
they hate to lose.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.884
Looks like we...

09:12.886 --> 09:15.020
have something in common.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.555
ROZZ:
Hey!

09:16.557 --> 09:18.890
What's up Stubert?
Hey, Pat, Hugh.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.759
Such a killer suit, man.
Loving the loose fit.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.894
Dude, we're huge fans.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.162
I mean, your show,
Thank you.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.997
it's what got us
through law school.

09:25.999 --> 09:26.932
LANDY: It was our law school.
ROZZ: Yeah.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.767
Oh, guys, this is

09:28.769 --> 09:30.101
Claire Lacoste,
our junior associate.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.270
She's gonna be
running point in there.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.872
Might remember Dean from a
little show called<i> The Grinder.</i>

09:33.874 --> 09:35.674
Oh, right. Hi.

09:35.676 --> 09:38.109
That's always nice to hear.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.278
What is?
I didn't say anything.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.247
I'm sorry, I thought you said
that you loved the show.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.915
Oh, I did not.

09:43.917 --> 09:47.018
Are you kidding me, Lacoste?
Where is this even coming from?

09:47.020 --> 09:48.753
Guys, it's okay.
She didn't like the show.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.455
But out of curiosity,
Ms. Lacoste,

09:50.457 --> 09:52.891
what exactly
didn't you like about it?

09:52.893 --> 09:54.559
Well, um...

09:54.561 --> 09:56.061
it was just
a little melodramatic.

09:56.063 --> 09:59.431
And cheesy, you know?

09:59.433 --> 10:01.066
And totally unrealistic
when it comes to,

10:01.068 --> 10:02.901
like, actually practicing law
in any way.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.569
Does that make sense?

10:04.571 --> 10:06.438
That makes perfect sense.
We should go.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.974
Or is that not
what you wanted to hear?

10:10.777 --> 10:12.477
No, that's...

10:12.479 --> 10:15.780
exactly what I wanted
to hear.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.315
Uh, Mr. Behar,
did my clients' relationship

10:17.317 --> 10:20.719
hurt the company in any way?
Objection-- speculation.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.454
Noted, but your client
still needs to answer.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.889
To my knowledge, no,
it didn't hurt the company.

10:24.891 --> 10:26.458
Beautiful line
of questioning.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.792
ROZZ:
Yeah, incredible.

10:27.794 --> 10:28.793
The only problem is

10:28.795 --> 10:30.795
your clients' termination

10:30.797 --> 10:32.063
was perfectly legal.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.665
But what if it wasn't?

10:36.470 --> 10:38.903
Well, it-it is.
First of all,

10:38.905 --> 10:41.072
it was clearly written
in the company guidelines.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.674
And your clients admit
they were well-aware of that.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.442
And second,
you can't ask questions.

10:44.444 --> 10:45.777
You're an actor.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.779
Stew...

10:47.781 --> 10:49.848
pose this question
to the room.

10:49.850 --> 10:53.952
Did Dawn and Trevor
violate company policy

10:53.954 --> 10:57.856
or did company policy
violate Dawn and Trevor?

10:59.993 --> 11:01.660
Oh!

11:01.662 --> 11:03.294
Uh, yes, uh...

11:03.296 --> 11:04.462
Did the, uh,

11:04.464 --> 11:06.164
did-did Dawn and Trevor's...

11:06.166 --> 11:09.934
Uh, did
the company violate the...?

11:09.936 --> 11:11.936
All right,
this can't happen every time!

11:11.938 --> 11:13.271
Let him ask what he wants.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.873
This is not
what we're talking about.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.108
If you're saying this
is a Constitutional issue,

11:17.110 --> 11:18.843
then you need to file a motion
with the State Supreme Court

11:18.845 --> 11:20.545
and establish standing,
thereby rendering

11:20.547 --> 11:22.380
this civil hearing unnecessary.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.949
Is that what you're saying,
Mr. Sanderson?

11:25.652 --> 11:27.719
Objection?

11:27.721 --> 11:30.388
On what grounds?
Hearsay?

11:30.390 --> 11:32.657
Do you even know what
that word means?
Of course!

11:32.659 --> 11:34.025
We said it every episode
on<i> The Grinder.</i>

11:34.027 --> 11:35.727
And do you know what?

11:35.729 --> 11:36.961
It worked every time.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.029
Every time.

11:38.031 --> 11:38.897
Sadly, it doesn't work here.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.632
As much as I love

11:40.634 --> 11:42.233
"what if it wasn't"
as a defense,

11:42.235 --> 11:43.735
you have nothing.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.473
Shall we?

11:50.977 --> 11:52.877
You're the freaking Grinder.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.045
We should bring this to
the state's attorney's office.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.914
It's over.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.249
But what if it wasn't?

11:58.251 --> 11:59.217
It doesn't work here, Todd.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.385
Right, sorry. I...

12:00.387 --> 12:01.653
Dean, come on, it's okay.

12:01.655 --> 12:02.921
You can't win them all.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.390
At least, we tried, right?

12:05.392 --> 12:06.925
And we're not done trying.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.326
Yeah.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.028
It isn't impossible.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.229
It is today.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.599
And it sickens me
to say this,

12:14.601 --> 12:16.668
because I've never
said it before, but...

12:17.704 --> 12:20.805
...I've lost.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.976
Excuse me.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.185
¶ Living on the road,
my friend ¶

12:34.187 --> 12:37.055
¶ Was gonna keep you free
and clean ¶

12:37.057 --> 12:39.791
¶ Now you wear your skin
like iron ¶

12:39.793 --> 12:42.961
¶ Your breath's
as hard as kerosene ¶

12:42.963 --> 12:46.297
¶ And all the Federales say ¶

12:46.299 --> 12:49.868
¶ They could've had him
any day ¶

12:49.870 --> 12:54.639
¶ They only let him
hang around ¶

12:54.641 --> 12:57.876
¶ Out of kindness,
I suppose. ¶

13:00.046 --> 13:01.045
DEBBIE: Hello?
(door closes)

13:01.047 --> 13:03.047
I'm home!

13:03.049 --> 13:05.116
Ethan, are you sleeping?

13:05.118 --> 13:06.918
Hey, Deb.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.888
Joel! Joel Zadak.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.723
Wow, you're here!
Why though?

13:11.725 --> 13:12.657
Dad said it was okay.

13:12.659 --> 13:14.559
Oh. Okay, well, I'm not.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.561
I'm not doing that,
so good-bye.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.763
You and your husband should
really get on the same page.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.598
Okay, I don't need
that from you, Zadak.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.000
Get out of here.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.902
Hi. Up to bed.
Let's go.

13:23.904 --> 13:24.936
Move it.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.404
Dean?

13:26.406 --> 13:27.839
Where's Stewart?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.911
(quietly):
Upstairs.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.980
I let him down.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.917
I let a lot of
people down.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.518
Millions of lovers
who can't be together

13:40.520 --> 13:42.287
simply because
they work together.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.956
Hmm...

13:44.958 --> 13:47.926
Right, well, um...

13:47.928 --> 13:50.762
I'm sure there's still some...

13:50.764 --> 13:52.630
hope

13:52.632 --> 13:54.799
for all of those

13:54.801 --> 13:58.036
unfairly persecuted lovers.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.571
No.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.714
Good night, Deborah.

14:09.716 --> 14:12.016
(walks away slowly)

14:12.018 --> 14:14.485
(sighs)

14:14.487 --> 14:17.255
Okay.

14:18.792 --> 14:20.625
What's going on?
What do you mean?

14:20.627 --> 14:23.394
Zadak is wandering around
like a free-range douchebag,

14:23.396 --> 14:25.663
and our son fell
asleep in his pasta.

14:25.665 --> 14:26.965
Yeah, I'm, um...

14:26.967 --> 14:28.633
trying something different.

14:28.635 --> 14:29.467
What? Why?

14:29.469 --> 14:30.468
'Cause I'm sick

14:30.470 --> 14:31.903
of being Pincus.

14:31.905 --> 14:34.305
Pincus from<i> The Grinder?</i>

14:34.307 --> 14:36.407
You know, I-I'm tired
of being the bad guy, Deb.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.076
I just, I don't know.

14:38.078 --> 14:41.880
I thought I'd just try
and say yes a little bit more.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.848
So, in trying not to be
a fictional character

14:43.850 --> 14:46.050
from your brother's
television show,

14:46.052 --> 14:48.152
you're letting
our real-life kids

14:48.154 --> 14:49.988
do whatever the hell they want

14:49.990 --> 14:51.923
and... we think
this is a good idea?

14:51.925 --> 14:53.758
Well, why do I have
to be the guy

14:53.760 --> 14:55.059
to keep everything
in balance, Deb?

14:55.061 --> 14:56.661
I mean, Dean gets
to be the hero

14:56.663 --> 14:58.997
and I have to be
the biggest wuss in TV history?

14:58.999 --> 15:00.999
Oh, honey.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.067
Sit down.

15:04.204 --> 15:07.839
Every hero needs a Pincus.

15:07.841 --> 15:10.909
The Grinder is nothing
without him.

15:10.911 --> 15:13.077
Pincus is just
as important as The Grinder.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.079
He needs<i> you.</i>

15:15.081 --> 15:17.582
And so do we.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.550
(quiet laugh)
Okay?

15:19.552 --> 15:21.953
(knocking)

15:21.955 --> 15:23.254
Hey, sorry, you two.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.023
Stew, you're blocking
me in, boss.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.765
Thought I might
find you in here.

15:33.767 --> 15:36.134
Yeah, well, if you do find me,

15:36.136 --> 15:39.103
do me a favor and let me know.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.706
You'll be the first.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.442
(sighs)

15:44.444 --> 15:46.377
Is this what
rock bottom feels like?

15:46.379 --> 15:47.946
"Rock bottom"?

15:47.948 --> 15:50.548
No, Dean, I mean...

15:54.054 --> 15:56.387
There are worse situations
to be in, right?

15:56.389 --> 15:57.655
Like AIDS, you mean?

15:57.657 --> 15:59.590
Yeah, that's a...

15:59.592 --> 16:01.592
that's one of them.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.294
Not-not one

16:03.296 --> 16:05.296
I would've chosen, but...

16:05.298 --> 16:07.632
Right, 'cause AIDS
you can kind of manage today.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.767
It's not the death sentence
it once was.

16:09.769 --> 16:12.070
Right.
I don't know, man.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.472
Maybe I made a mistake
moving back here.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.773
You're being too
hard on yourself.

16:15.775 --> 16:18.176
It was just one tiny hiccup.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.013
Do you think I'm good at this?

16:22.015 --> 16:23.982
D-Do I think...?

16:23.984 --> 16:25.616
Do I think you're good at...?

16:25.618 --> 16:27.618
Yes, mm-hmm, yep.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.355
I think you have a...

16:30.357 --> 16:33.024
you have an interesting
perspective.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.459
And, um,

16:34.461 --> 16:36.427
you have a lot,
a lot of potential.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.463
And, um,

16:38.465 --> 16:41.432
uh... charisma.

16:41.434 --> 16:44.035
But it's not enough, is it?

16:47.173 --> 16:49.974
Call Rozz and Landy.

16:49.976 --> 16:52.176
Tell them we fold.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.287
You're right, Dean,
the case is hopeless.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.025
It's unwinnable.

17:07.027 --> 17:10.795
It literally
can't be done.

17:12.632 --> 17:15.166
What did you say?

17:15.168 --> 17:17.001
I said you're out
of your depth, Dean.

17:17.003 --> 17:18.870
Walk away.

17:18.872 --> 17:21.739
Are you saying it's...

17:21.741 --> 17:23.975
impossible?

17:23.977 --> 17:27.078
That is exactly
what I'm saying.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.479
Like, no one could do it.

17:28.481 --> 17:31.883
There is not
a lawyer

17:31.885 --> 17:34.685
on this planet.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.988
And what would happen
if I ignored you?

17:36.990 --> 17:41.025
Then...

17:41.027 --> 17:43.895
we would lose everything
we've worked for?

17:44.998 --> 17:47.231
Uh, the law firm.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.567
Everything.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.672
Call Behar.

17:54.674 --> 17:58.142
I'm not through
with him yet.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.848
DEAN SR.:
<i> It's beautiful.</i>

18:03.850 --> 18:05.550
My boys back together again.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.251
You with your confidence
restored

18:07.253 --> 18:10.021
and you all sweaty and nervous.

18:10.023 --> 18:11.289
I love it.
I love it, too.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.024
I love, uh, I love,
I love this energy,

18:13.026 --> 18:15.293
and I love, you know,
our walk was great.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.594
And us together.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.929
Uh, but we still don't, um,

18:17.931 --> 18:19.764
don't have a case.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.100
Don't need it-- we just go
in there and we grind.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.768
Together.
That's all.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.736
Yeah, but it be nice
if we had an angle.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.105
That's true.
An angle's good to have.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.940
They're saying we
only have an hour.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.541
That Behar's a busy man.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.543
"A busy man."

18:32.545 --> 18:34.378
Hmm.

18:34.380 --> 18:37.115
Hey, Stew?

18:37.117 --> 18:38.316
You thinking what I'm thinking?

18:39.285 --> 18:41.285
Maybe?

18:43.123 --> 18:45.123
What are we doing here?

18:45.125 --> 18:46.124
Yeah, I answered
all your questions.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.458
Todd.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.266
We have more.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.068
A lot more.
What?

18:57.070 --> 18:58.970
So I hope that there's
nowhere you need to be,

18:58.972 --> 19:00.771
because this could take a while.
How long?

19:00.773 --> 19:03.141
Just as long as we want to
talk to you, you son of a...

19:03.143 --> 19:04.609
Dad! Ju...

19:04.611 --> 19:05.977
DEAN SR.:
Sorry.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.278
Long enough to explore
their entire

19:07.280 --> 19:10.314
two-year employment history.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.150
Day by day.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.118
By day.
What?

19:14.120 --> 19:15.987
Day one.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.990
Is he allowed to do this?
According to Rule 26B

19:18.992 --> 19:21.092
of the 2000 Amendments,
the court allows additional time

19:21.094 --> 19:22.093
for full examination
of the deponent

19:22.095 --> 19:24.695
in all employment cases.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.297
Yeah, but still, objection.
This is irrelevant.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.298
It's a waste of everyone's time.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.100
Dean, she's right.

19:29.102 --> 19:30.501
It's time to walk away.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.603
This will take weeks!
I don't have weeks.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.839
That may be, but you
still have to answer.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.809
May 1, 2013.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.978
Dawn's first day on the job.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.813
Do you recall
what she was wearing that day?

19:42.815 --> 19:44.448
Of course not!
Later that day,

19:44.450 --> 19:46.551
Trevor spilled coffee
on his pants...

19:46.553 --> 19:47.685
Okay, stop.
Mr. Behar...

19:47.687 --> 19:48.819
Do you remember that?

19:48.821 --> 19:50.288
I don't have time for this.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.223
What if I hire
both of them back?

19:52.225 --> 19:54.025
Will this whole
thing go away?

19:54.027 --> 19:55.993
It's not enough.

19:55.995 --> 19:56.994
What do you mean?

19:56.996 --> 19:58.196
Uh, Dean, it actually is enough.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.197
We got what we came for...

19:59.199 --> 20:02.166
No, we came for the policy!

20:02.168 --> 20:04.068
And we are not leaving

20:04.070 --> 20:06.237
without it.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.471
What...? Does he want me
to change the policy?

20:07.473 --> 20:09.207
Is that what
he's trying to say?

20:09.209 --> 20:11.676
I think that's
what he wants, yes.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.644
Objection-- hearsay?

20:13.646 --> 20:14.679
Almost.

20:14.681 --> 20:15.980
BEHAR:
Fine.

20:15.982 --> 20:17.815
I'll change the policy.
Is this thing over?

20:17.817 --> 20:19.550
Not yet.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.853
Todd?

20:22.855 --> 20:24.488
Grinder rests?

20:24.490 --> 20:25.790
Damn right he does.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.331
So I'm asking questions, but
I don't care about the answers.

20:33.333 --> 20:37.401
I'm looking for the answers
<i> behind</i> the answers.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.070
Hi. Sorry to, uh, break this up.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.404
Stew, he's mid-story.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.939
I'll be quick.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.874
Uh, like I was saying,
uh, earlier,

20:43.876 --> 20:45.209
we have a lot
of new cases...

20:45.211 --> 20:46.711
Thanks to Dean!

20:46.713 --> 20:48.446
Bravo.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.081
Yes, thanks to Dean.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.883
And thanks to Todd for always
reminding us to clap for him.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.852
Still, uh,
we do need some help.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.021
So, um,
I brought someone on,

20:57.023 --> 20:58.289
who I think will fit in

20:58.291 --> 21:01.092
and just balance things
out perfectly.

21:01.094 --> 21:03.027
I'd like to introduce,
uh, Claire Lacoste,

21:03.029 --> 21:05.029
our new senior associate.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.063
Hi.

21:06.065 --> 21:09.533
Well, I did not see this coming.

21:09.535 --> 21:12.103
Welcome aboard, Counselor.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.804
Thank you.

21:13.806 --> 21:16.407
It's gonna be interesting.
What is?

21:16.409 --> 21:17.708
Let me just put this
out on the table

21:17.710 --> 21:18.709
so that things don't get weird.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.544
Okay.

21:20.546 --> 21:21.812
There's obviously something
powerful at play here.

21:21.814 --> 21:22.947
Where?

21:22.949 --> 21:24.282
You know, we met as opponents,

21:24.284 --> 21:26.150
on opposite ends
of the battlefield.

21:26.152 --> 21:28.819
And now we're working
side by side.

21:28.821 --> 21:29.754
And that can be hard.

21:29.756 --> 21:32.056
Hmm.
So...

21:32.058 --> 21:33.291
so I think that we should
have a plan, you know,

21:33.293 --> 21:34.659
to try to deal with it.

21:34.661 --> 21:36.327
Or I could just
nip this in the bud

21:36.329 --> 21:38.462
right now by saying that
there is no chance in hell

21:38.464 --> 21:41.065
that you and I
are ever gonna happen.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.634
Like, it's impossible.

21:49.609 --> 21:51.676
But what if it wasn't?

21:54.947 --> 21:56.981
