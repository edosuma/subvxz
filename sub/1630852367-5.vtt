WEBVTT

00:11.261 --> 00:13.472
-Get goin', go on -Get goin', go on

00:13.555 --> 00:15.891
-Take friends along -Take friends along

00:15.974 --> 00:18.143
-Go do it all -Go do it all

00:18.227 --> 00:20.103
We all just gotta unplug

00:20.187 --> 00:22.564
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

00:22.648 --> 00:24.942
Just like the way Doug unplugs

00:41.124 --> 00:42.292
Hi, Uncle Forkrick.

00:44.586 --> 00:45.754
Uncle Forkrick?

00:46.088 --> 00:48.382
He's in sleep mode, Doug.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.926
That happens when a bot repeats the same job

00:51.009 --> 00:53.345
over and over and over the same way.

00:53.428 --> 00:54.638
Just give him a reset.

00:57.808 --> 00:58.809
Busy day, Doug.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.104
I have to move all these boxes from the factory to the warehouse.

01:02.187 --> 01:06.733
I just go back and forth and back and forth and back.

01:09.778 --> 01:14.324
Doug, my bot. We just got a big delivery, and it's time to reboot!

01:14.408 --> 01:16.034
I could use a helping hand.

01:16.118 --> 01:17.578
Great, Dad. Be right there.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.415
And forth. Just keep on rolling.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.125
What do you say, Doug?

01:23.792 --> 01:26.128
Should we reboot these old shorts into socks?

01:26.211 --> 01:29.715
A blanket? A reusable shopping bag?

01:30.799 --> 01:32.551
How about the shopping bag?

01:40.434 --> 01:42.436
Look who ordered it! Emma's dad!

01:42.811 --> 01:44.104
Can I deliver it to him?

01:44.188 --> 01:45.272
You botcha, son.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.868
Doug, what are you doing here?

01:57.951 --> 02:02.039
I was just playing a game, and ding-dong, you're here.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.124
Now you can play the game with me.

02:04.208 --> 02:07.085
Hark! My delivery from Rebots.

02:07.169 --> 02:10.422
My sincerest gratitude, Sir Doug the deliverer.

02:10.797 --> 02:14.426
This is what I've been waiting for, my shopping bag.

02:14.510 --> 02:18.180
Now we can finally go shopping at the grocery store.

02:19.348 --> 02:22.643
The grocery store? Can't I stay here?

02:22.726 --> 02:24.520
Doug's gonna play my game with me.

02:24.603 --> 02:28.482
Come on, Emma-Bean. Grocery shopping can be just like a game.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.400
Wait, grocery store?

02:30.484 --> 02:33.320
I've never heard of that before. What is it?

02:33.403 --> 02:35.322
Give it a plug, Doug.

02:38.116 --> 02:42.079
We're going shopping At the grocery store

02:42.162 --> 02:44.248
In every aisle There's piles and piles

02:44.331 --> 02:45.916
-Of food for us to eat -Yum!

02:45.999 --> 02:47.793
We'll check our list So we don't miss

02:47.876 --> 02:49.461
The things we really need

02:49.545 --> 02:51.588
There's fresh fruit and cheese Sliced deli meat

02:51.672 --> 02:53.090
And tasty frozen treats

02:53.173 --> 02:56.760
You might call it supermarket But it's grocery store to me

02:58.345 --> 03:02.266
We're going shopping At the grocery store

03:02.349 --> 03:05.727
Picked up everything On our list and more

03:05.811 --> 03:07.771
-Our cart has -No more room

03:07.855 --> 03:09.523
-Except for -Yummy fruit

03:09.606 --> 03:11.900
Let's grab our bag and scoot Out of the...

03:11.984 --> 03:13.151
Grocery store

03:14.570 --> 03:17.698
So a grocery store is where humans shop for food.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.992
But I have a big question.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.828
How can grocery shopping be like a game?

03:23.370 --> 03:27.875
That's my question too, Doug. 'Cause I'm pretty sure it can't.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.209
You'll see.

03:29.293 --> 03:30.919
Unplug and join us, Doug.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.421
Come on, my shiny friend.

03:32.504 --> 03:34.590
At least we'll get through this together.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.636
Wow, the grocery store.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.972
There's so much stuff here.

03:42.055 --> 03:45.267
So many colors and smells...

03:45.350 --> 03:46.852
and sounds.

03:47.352 --> 03:50.230
-What's that, Mr. Pine? -It's a shopping list, Doug.

03:50.314 --> 03:53.734
I wrote down what we need to find so we don't forget anything.

03:53.817 --> 03:56.153
We have to get all of that?

03:56.486 --> 04:00.782
Dad, this is gonna take all day.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.160
Where's your sense of adventure?

04:03.243 --> 04:05.913
First item on the list, Swiss cheese.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.915
To the deli!

04:07.998 --> 04:10.501
Enjoy that pimento loaf now.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.545
Number two. Serving number two.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.048
What do you do with that?

04:16.130 --> 04:17.382
It's a ticket, Doug.

04:17.466 --> 04:20.511
At the deli, everybody takes a ticket with a number on it.

04:20.594 --> 04:24.806
When they call your number, that's how you know it's your turn to order.

04:25.516 --> 04:27.351
So, the next number is three.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.061
Let me see that.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.854
We're 20?

04:31.188 --> 04:32.898
And the board says three.

04:32.981 --> 04:38.695
Three is like, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

04:38.779 --> 04:43.825
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

04:43.909 --> 04:47.412
Seventeen numbers away from 20?

04:47.496 --> 04:49.581
We're never gonna get home.

04:49.665 --> 04:51.083
I don't know, Dad.

04:51.166 --> 04:55.254
Waiting for Swiss cheese doesn't seem like a game to me.

04:55.337 --> 04:59.216
Then why don't you two see if you can collect everything on the list

04:59.299 --> 05:00.759
before they call number 20?

05:01.176 --> 05:04.179
If you can, you'll get a surprise.

05:04.263 --> 05:08.225
-A surprise? -I love surprises.

05:08.308 --> 05:12.688
Wonderful! The first thing you must get is our family's favorite melon,

05:12.771 --> 05:13.772
a cantaloupe.

05:13.856 --> 05:14.898
We're on it!

05:14.982 --> 05:16.441
Grab a cart, Doug.

05:17.526 --> 05:18.986
-Let's roll! -Let's roll!

05:21.530 --> 05:24.157
Check out all the different melons.

05:24.241 --> 05:27.160
Honeydew, watermelon, Santa Claus melons.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.663
Santa Claus melons?

05:29.746 --> 05:31.540
But where's the cantaloupe?

05:33.292 --> 05:34.585
What about these, Emma?

05:35.460 --> 05:38.046
Doug, you're a melon master.

05:38.130 --> 05:42.092
But hold up! You can't pick just any cantaloupe, Doug.

05:42.176 --> 05:45.596
You need to find one that's perfectly ripe, so it tastes good.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.556
I may have an app for that.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.850
No app needed, buddy.

05:49.933 --> 05:53.145
You want the perfect melon? You just gotta sniff.

05:53.228 --> 05:56.899
It should smell... like cantaloupe.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.775
Then squeeze it right here.

05:58.859 --> 06:02.446
Too hard? It's not ripe. Too soft? It's almost rotten.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.699
Then you shake, shake, shake it.

06:05.782 --> 06:09.995
If you hear the seeds, you know it's just right.

06:11.747 --> 06:14.082
Sniff, squeeze, shake, nope.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.460
Sniff, sniff, squeeze, shake. Nope, nope.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.295
Sniff, squeeze, shake.

06:18.921 --> 06:20.797
Sniff, sniff, squeeze, shake.

06:21.298 --> 06:22.966
We have a winner!

06:23.675 --> 06:26.220
Great. That's one item from our list down.

06:26.303 --> 06:30.891
Next up, paper cups, napkins, paper plates and tissues.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.477
They must be down that aisle.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.146
But where's the paper stuff we need?

06:37.231 --> 06:39.399
It looks like they're way up there, Emma.

06:40.609 --> 06:43.362
Top shelf? What are we supposed to do?

06:43.445 --> 06:47.658
We can reach it, Emma, with my robo-springs.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.034
Nice one, Doug.

06:49.117 --> 06:53.747
Now let's make some baskets by dropping them in our basket.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.834
Paper cups. Napkins.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.711
The bot shoots. The bot scores!

06:59.795 --> 07:02.881
Paper towels and here come the tissues.

07:02.965 --> 07:05.801
It's a double grocery slam dunk.

07:05.884 --> 07:09.012
And the shoppers go wild!

07:10.889 --> 07:12.724
-We did it! -Yeah!

07:12.808 --> 07:14.601
Paper goods, check.

07:14.685 --> 07:18.730
We are on a roll, Doug, with plenty of time to finish.

07:18.814 --> 07:21.567
-Number ten! -Or not.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.777
What's next on the list, Mr. Pine?

07:23.861 --> 07:27.322
My favorite thing for dessert.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.992
We're getting Froyo, Doug.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.245
What's Froyo?

07:33.954 --> 07:38.000
Doug. Froyo is kind of like ice cream, only softer.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.961
Perfect for a warm, summer evening.

07:41.044 --> 07:45.048
A pleasing palate cleanser after a rich meal.

07:45.132 --> 07:48.552
I bet it's in the freezer! That's where we keep it at my house.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.053
I know.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.890
I'll upload my robo-temperature gauge.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.808
That should lead us to anything cold.

07:54.892 --> 07:57.895
Okay, I'm detecting a temperature drop.

07:57.978 --> 08:01.231
If it's getting colder, we may be getting closer to the freezer.

08:01.315 --> 08:02.399
Keep going, Doug.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.945
Now my systems indicate it's getting warmer.

08:07.029 --> 08:08.155
Turn, Doug. Turn.

08:09.448 --> 08:11.491
Getting colder. Go, Doug, go.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.827
I can almost taste that Froyo.

08:14.703 --> 08:15.746
Getting warmer!

08:18.040 --> 08:19.583
Still warm. Other way!

08:20.042 --> 08:21.043
Keep going, Doug.

08:21.126 --> 08:24.630
It's getting chilly in here.

08:26.757 --> 08:28.467
Is this the freezer, Emma?

08:29.176 --> 08:31.887
It's the freezer all right. Wish me luck.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.600
Froyo anyone? Check.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.059
-Bravo. -Way to go, Emma!

08:38.143 --> 08:40.354
Fifteen. Calling number 15.

08:40.437 --> 08:43.273
Fifteen. Sixteen, 17, 18, 19, 20.

08:43.899 --> 08:46.276
Fifteen is just five away from 20!

08:46.360 --> 08:48.904
How much more do we have to get, Mr. Pine?

08:51.281 --> 08:53.659
-A lot more! -Let's get shopping!

09:02.543 --> 09:04.336
Free samples.

09:11.009 --> 09:12.928
Did we do it, Dad? Are we finished?

09:13.011 --> 09:15.430
Do we get a surprise?

09:15.514 --> 09:20.102
Almost. There's just one more item to go. Orange juice!

09:20.185 --> 09:22.020
Number 19!

09:22.104 --> 09:24.523
Oh, no! Twenty is next.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.859
Doug, we've got to find that juice fast.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.446
I see the juice.

09:31.530 --> 09:34.157
It's all the way on the other side of the store.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.910
Good work, buddy. But we gotta go, go, go!

09:36.994 --> 09:38.287
Onward to juice!

09:38.662 --> 09:40.706
-Excuse me. Pardon us. -Sorry. Pardon me.

09:40.789 --> 09:43.083
Almost there.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.087
Order up. Number 20.

09:47.963 --> 09:52.259
Oh, no! We were so close.

09:52.968 --> 09:54.720
We didn't do it.

09:54.803 --> 09:58.932
Well, at least we had a good time looking for the things on the list.

09:59.016 --> 10:01.810
Wait a minute.

10:01.894 --> 10:06.190
A scavenger hunt is a game where you look for things on a list.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.901
Doug, we were on a scavenger hunt.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.861
We were playing a game.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.781
Indeed you were. Aren't you glad you didn't stay home?

10:14.865 --> 10:19.369
Yeah! Because I learned you can turn anything into a game. Even shopping.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.623
I somersault in--

10:22.706 --> 10:26.376
Yeah, let's save that joy for the backyard, Emma-Bean.

10:26.460 --> 10:31.298
This way, shoppers. I think there just might be a surprise in store after all.

10:34.843 --> 10:37.179
This is the best surprise, Dad.

10:37.262 --> 10:40.557
I've always wanted to use the self-checkout machine.

10:45.938 --> 10:47.940
Thank you for shopping with us.

10:48.023 --> 10:49.483
You are very welcome.

10:49.566 --> 10:52.778
Wow, I didn't know robots worked in the grocery store.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.781
I love how anything can be turned into a game.

10:56.490 --> 11:00.869
Wait. Initiating brainstorm sequence. I have an idea.

11:01.411 --> 11:05.832
Okay, Uncle Forkrick, the obstacle course game is ready to go.

11:07.751 --> 11:10.003
Your work will go faster because you're having fun.

11:11.004 --> 11:15.259
Plus, you won't shut down anymore 'cause you're moving the boxes in different ways.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.512
Wow. This game makes me feel like I could run for weeks.

11:19.263 --> 11:20.472
How'd you think of it, Doug?

11:20.556 --> 11:25.602
Well, because today I learned you can make anything into a game.

11:25.978 --> 11:27.354
And this is a great one.

11:33.777 --> 11:38.448
Just one more socket turn and... ta-da!

11:38.532 --> 11:41.618
Wow! Wait, what is it?

11:41.702 --> 11:47.708
Doug, meet my newest invention. Introducing the Giz-Go.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.795
The Giz-Go is a new kind of toolbox that can follow you around.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.338
I call it the Giz-Go

11:53.422 --> 11:58.510
because it's got all the gizmos a robot inventor could need on the go.

11:58.594 --> 12:01.180
It has a tape measure, a wrench,

12:01.263 --> 12:04.600
a gardening shovel, an applause button.

12:06.310 --> 12:09.146
Because you should always celebrate a job well done.

12:09.813 --> 12:12.232
That's amazing, Mom. Can I try it?

12:12.649 --> 12:16.778
You botcha! You can press the purple button to get a new tool,

12:16.862 --> 12:21.158
or this yellow one, which makes the Giz-Go follow you wherever you go.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.378
Oops.

12:33.462 --> 12:36.840
As you can see, it still needs a little work.

12:36.924 --> 12:39.051
I'll get it back, Mom. I promise.

12:39.134 --> 12:41.220
-Good luck, sweetie. -Thanks, Mom!

12:42.262 --> 12:43.305
Giz-Go.

12:44.765 --> 12:45.766
Giz-Go!

12:48.435 --> 12:50.854
-Giz-Go? -Giz what?

12:50.938 --> 12:52.481
Excuse me, Miss Bot.

12:59.738 --> 13:00.656
Emma?

13:00.739 --> 13:02.950
Hi, best robot friend a girl could ever want.

13:03.033 --> 13:07.371
I was wondering if you wanted to come with me on an adventure.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.831
It'll be just like the ones in adventure books.

13:09.915 --> 13:13.252
Especially like my new favorite series of all time,

13:13.335 --> 13:16.505
The Adventures of Gemstone Joan.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.841
Quick! Here's your adventure hat.

13:18.924 --> 13:21.760
-Joan loves hats. -Wow, thanks.

13:22.219 --> 13:26.807
Doug, you, my shiny friend, look fashionably adventurous.

13:26.890 --> 13:30.477
Emma, I can tell you're excited about this adventure idea.

13:31.061 --> 13:33.313
Doug, I'm not excited.

13:33.939 --> 13:36.400
I'm super-duper double plus excited!

13:36.483 --> 13:39.945
And I bet if I knew what an adventure was, I'd be too.

13:40.863 --> 13:43.740
You've never heard of an adventure?

13:43.824 --> 13:45.325
You gotta plug in, Doug.

13:45.409 --> 13:46.702
One step ahead of you.

13:47.953 --> 13:52.583
No two days will ever be the same Adventure is my middle name

13:54.084 --> 13:57.129
Lava jumper, mountain climber Part-time tunnel treasure finder

13:57.212 --> 14:01.466
Jungle runner, gem detector Full-time puzzle clue connector

14:01.550 --> 14:02.843
-Adventure -Yeah!

14:02.926 --> 14:04.720
Exciting places to visit

14:04.803 --> 14:05.888
-Adventure -Yeah!

14:05.971 --> 14:07.681
With my backpack and tool kit

14:07.764 --> 14:08.932
-Adventure -Yeah!

14:09.016 --> 14:10.851
Take a leap and we'll make it

14:10.934 --> 14:16.190
No two days will ever be the same Adventure is my middle name

14:17.232 --> 14:20.110
Now I'm super-duper double plus excited.

14:20.194 --> 14:24.198
Adventures look amazing! Let's go on one!

14:25.824 --> 14:30.329
Only, I have a big question. Where do you find an adventure?

14:30.412 --> 14:33.749
I'll show you, Doug. Unplug and follow me!

14:36.710 --> 14:38.712
Emma, I have a problem.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.465
You don't like the hat? Don't worry. We can trade.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.592
No, I forgot something important.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.552
I can't go on an adventure right now.

14:45.636 --> 14:49.306
I promised my mom I'd catch her Giz-Go invention and bring it back.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.099
It might take a while.

14:52.518 --> 14:54.895
You should probably go on an adventure without me.

14:54.978 --> 14:59.608
But this is perfect! Catching the zippy box can be our adventure!

14:59.691 --> 15:00.984
What do you mean, Emma?

15:01.068 --> 15:03.278
The Giz-Go is zooming all around Rebots.

15:03.362 --> 15:05.364
We can't have an adventure in my home.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.950
According to what I just learned,

15:08.033 --> 15:12.371
adventures happen in amazing, far-off places, not where you live.

15:12.454 --> 15:15.791
Don't worry, Doug. Do you hear that?

15:15.874 --> 15:19.294
That's the call to adventure!

15:19.628 --> 15:22.214
After that gadget, adventure buddy!

15:23.257 --> 15:25.801
But all I heard was Giz-Go's squeaky wheel.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.603
This is gonna be tricky.

15:38.188 --> 15:40.524
Emma, what are we looking at?

15:41.024 --> 15:42.943
I'm just trying to figure out the best way

15:43.026 --> 15:45.696
to scale this snowcapped mountain.

15:45.779 --> 15:51.201
It's gonna be tough, extremely cold, and almost impossible.

15:51.285 --> 15:55.080
But top-notch adventurers like us will be able to handle it.

15:55.497 --> 15:57.124
But I don't see a mountain.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.793
It's right there! Look!

15:59.877 --> 16:03.797
With your imagination tion, tion, tion.

16:03.881 --> 16:06.758
I don't think I have that app. How do I download it?

16:07.885 --> 16:10.137
Imagination's not an app, Doug.

16:10.220 --> 16:13.015
You gotta pretend, not plug in.

16:13.390 --> 16:16.518
Picture something different from what you're really seeing.

16:16.602 --> 16:18.770
Something more adventure-y.

16:19.271 --> 16:23.317
Like, you may see a ramp, but if you use your imagination,

16:23.400 --> 16:25.819
that ramp can become a mountain.

16:26.778 --> 16:29.406
Okay. Hang onto your hats.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.871
That's cold.

16:38.081 --> 16:40.959
We must be on the highest mountain in the world!

16:41.418 --> 16:43.378
We gotta climb to the top.

16:45.756 --> 16:47.299
Yes, made it!

16:48.383 --> 16:51.094
I wonder how many have even reached the top.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.472
Probably about 50 robots each day.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.349
-Fifty-one. -Fifty-two.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.558
This is a busy ramp.

16:56.934 --> 16:58.227
Come on, adventure buddy.

16:58.310 --> 17:03.106
You gotta get climbing, or we won't catch your mom's runaway invention.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.150
Okay.

17:08.987 --> 17:13.951
Yay! You made it through the first part of our adventure.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.287
That didn't seem like an adventure to me, Emma.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.414
But there's the Giz-Go.

17:19.498 --> 17:22.542
Let's grab it and then we could go on a real adventure.

17:24.169 --> 17:25.170
That way!

17:26.003 --> 17:27.005
That way.

17:30.592 --> 17:32.511
Watch out! Hot lava!

17:32.594 --> 17:33.595
Hot lava?

17:33.679 --> 17:36.932
Hot lava? That sounds dangerous. Back in a flash.

17:39.142 --> 17:43.105
Emma, where do you see lava? This is just a regular floor.

17:43.730 --> 17:49.361
Look closer, Doug, and you'll see there's lava under all these rocks.

17:50.821 --> 17:52.155
It's hot!

17:53.031 --> 17:55.242
I'm sorry, Emma, but I really don't--

17:55.325 --> 17:57.077
Adventure buddy, no!

17:57.160 --> 18:01.248
This is how we must cross the hot lava rocks of Reboticka.

18:03.458 --> 18:04.459
Reboticka?

18:05.210 --> 18:07.629
You see, Doug, in adventures,

18:07.713 --> 18:12.509
you jump from rock to rock to stay safe, just like Gemstone Joan.

18:13.302 --> 18:17.181
But whatever you do, do not touch the cracks.

18:25.397 --> 18:27.566
Emma, according to my temperature gauge,

18:27.649 --> 18:30.903
this room is pleasantly cool, not lava hot.

18:33.864 --> 18:40.245
Doug, you gotta use your imagination tion, tion, tion, tion.

18:42.706 --> 18:46.502
The Giz-Go! Is it just me or is that thing getting faster?

18:46.585 --> 18:48.921
Let's go, adventure buddy.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.468
Quick! This way. Hurry.

18:54.551 --> 18:59.097
We need to get this lava cleaned up in a flash before somebotty gets hurt.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.725
I don't see any lava.

19:01.808 --> 19:02.809
Me neither.

19:02.893 --> 19:04.811
The floor is squeaky clean.

19:06.021 --> 19:07.773
Then my job is complete!

19:08.815 --> 19:09.900
Safety first.

19:29.837 --> 19:34.633
Doug, is it my imagination or did it all of a sudden get kinda dark in here?

19:35.008 --> 19:37.177
No, it's dark all right.

19:37.261 --> 19:40.055
I think the Giz-Go accidentally shut off the power.

19:40.138 --> 19:44.852
But how can we find the Giz-Go if we can't see anything?

19:44.935 --> 19:47.563
How can we find our way out?

19:49.231 --> 19:52.901
Wait a nanosecond. What do adventurers do when they can't see?

19:53.986 --> 19:55.904
Yeah! They use headlamps.

19:55.988 --> 19:59.199
So what if I pretend I'm on an adventure like that?

20:04.621 --> 20:05.873
I think I'm doing it, Emma.

20:06.248 --> 20:10.210
I'm using my imagination tion, tion, tion.

20:10.294 --> 20:13.797
Attabot! And what do you see, adventure buddy?

20:14.214 --> 20:16.592
I see that we're in a giant tunnel.

20:18.594 --> 20:19.928
I see it too, Doug.

20:25.851 --> 20:27.311
And there's the Giz-Go.

20:28.854 --> 20:31.940
Or maybe it's a runaway mine cart.

20:32.983 --> 20:35.068
Solid imagining, Doug.

20:35.611 --> 20:38.197
In Gemstone Joan and the Runaway Mine Cart,

20:38.280 --> 20:40.699
Joan stopped the cart with a giant net.

20:40.782 --> 20:43.160
Too bad we don't have one of those.

20:46.371 --> 20:47.915
Yes, we do.

20:48.665 --> 20:52.461
Now that's using your imagination.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.312
We caught my mom's invention.

21:10.395 --> 21:13.190
I mean, the mine cart, and it was an adventure,

21:13.273 --> 21:16.193
because I learned when you use your imagination,

21:16.276 --> 21:18.403
anything can become an adventure.

21:18.487 --> 21:21.114
I couldn't have done it without you, adventure buddy.

21:21.573 --> 21:23.742
You called me adventure buddy.

21:24.326 --> 21:27.412
Well, better get the Giz-Go back to your mom.

21:31.708 --> 21:34.294
There. Now he won't run off anymore.

21:34.378 --> 21:36.755
Thank you so much for bringing him back, Doug.

21:36.839 --> 21:38.549
I hope it wasn't too much trouble.

21:38.632 --> 21:40.884
Not at all. It was an adventure.

21:40.968 --> 21:45.430
Wait, you went on an adventure here in our home? How?

21:45.848 --> 21:50.102
-We used our imagination. -Tion, tion, tion, tion.

21:50.727 --> 21:55.566
Incredible. You'll have to show me how to have an imaginary adventure soon.

21:55.649 --> 21:58.068
But right now, since I have the Giz-Go back,

21:58.151 --> 21:59.820
it's time to weed the garden.

22:00.237 --> 22:05.701
Mom, do you mean you have to find your way through that wild jungle?

22:06.410 --> 22:07.494
What jungle?

22:08.453 --> 22:12.374
This jungle. The one covered with giant flowers and plants.

22:19.965 --> 22:21.258
All right, adventurers,

22:21.341 --> 22:24.803
it's going to be hard to collect all those mega dandelions,

22:24.887 --> 22:27.389
but if we work together, we can do it.

22:29.349 --> 22:31.935
Adventure buddy squad, let's go.

22:48.619 --> 22:49.870
-Adventure -Yeah!

22:49.953 --> 22:51.705
Exciting places to visit

22:51.788 --> 22:52.998
-Adventure -Yeah!

22:53.081 --> 22:54.750
With my backpack and tool kit

22:54.833 --> 22:56.001
-Adventure -Yeah!

22:56.084 --> 22:57.920
Take a leap and we'll make it

22:58.003 --> 23:00.547
No two days will ever be the same

23:00.631 --> 23:03.300
Adventure is my middle name
