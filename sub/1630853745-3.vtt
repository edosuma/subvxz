WEBVTT

00:04.921 --> 00:06.339
-Natalya.
-Yes?

00:06.381 --> 00:07.132
Natasha.

00:07.173 --> 00:08.633
It’s so confusing.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.301
And you guys look alike,
you’re gorgeous brunettes,

00:10.343 --> 00:12.220
-and Natalya and Natasha.
-We’re like twins.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.555
I’m like, it’s not fair!

00:13.596 --> 00:16.391
Are there any of this
without cinnamon?

00:16.433 --> 00:18.393
Do we have any of the beef
without cinnamon in?

00:18.435 --> 00:20.228
Yes.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.777
...the courage
to keep fighting.

00:27.819 --> 00:30.447
David, bravo.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.157
Ooh... ah!

00:32.198 --> 00:33.241
Oh-ho!

00:33.283 --> 00:34.909
Twenty-seven thousand dollars.

00:34.951 --> 00:37.162
-Wow!
-Woo!

00:37.203 --> 00:39.164
-Shot, shot, shot.
-See ya later.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.457
I get lost in her ----ing eyes.

00:40.498 --> 00:42.000
I’ve got a thing
for Australians, mate.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.794
I’m into it, but Storm’s
moustache needs to go.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.379
No, no, no.

00:46.421 --> 00:47.964
So, myself and Storm,
we’ve been childhood friends.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.675
He’s had that same
moustache since he was 13.

00:52.093 --> 00:53.553
Home, sweet, home.

00:53.595 --> 00:56.389
-Ah!
-Oh what the [bleep]!

00:56.431 --> 00:58.933
Just did a month
charter with Natasha.

00:58.975 --> 01:00.352
We’re good friends.

01:03.855 --> 01:05.940
I was in a long-term
relationship for,

01:05.982 --> 01:07.525
like, four and a half years.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.737
Now I’m single, I can flirt
with people if I want.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.202
[sighs]

01:19.954 --> 01:21.831
No, we’re not.

01:21.873 --> 01:24.292
You’re in a cabin together
and you’ve worked together.

01:24.334 --> 01:27.128
I want to be a couple,
but we’re not a couple.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.257
On our last boat,

01:31.299 --> 01:33.468
me and
Tash, we got together.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.762
Tash asked me to keep it secret

01:35.804 --> 01:38.348
because she was still
with her boyfriend.

01:38.390 --> 01:41.267
But I’m struggling
with keeping it a secret.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.651
What is he doing?

01:49.693 --> 01:52.237
I’ve made it clear that
I don’t want anyone to know.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.655
It’s only a matter of time

01:53.697 --> 01:55.824
before he tells everybody
that we hooked up...

01:57.242 --> 01:58.618
Ugh.

02:12.757 --> 02:15.969
On our old boat,
me and Tash, we got on.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.137
We got on really well.

02:17.178 --> 02:18.805
It was immediate,
it was a flame.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.306
It was... it was firing.

02:20.348 --> 02:23.476
I was with my ex for, like,
four and a half years,

02:23.518 --> 02:26.521
and when I joined my last boat

02:26.563 --> 02:28.648
the relationship
wasn’t in a good place.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.150
She was telling me
all this stuff,

02:30.191 --> 02:31.943
saying that she’s not happy
with her boyfriend,

02:31.985 --> 02:33.486
and she wanted to be with me.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.280
I thought it was super
intimate because of,

02:35.321 --> 02:36.489
like, how it happened.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.324
He would pay me
a lot of compliments,

02:38.366 --> 02:41.202
like "You look rad."

02:41.244 --> 02:42.787
We just had
so much fun together.

02:44.205 --> 02:47.459
She was, like, sneaking into
my room, and so secretive,

02:47.500 --> 02:49.252
it made it more, like,
I don’t know,

02:49.294 --> 02:50.503
more passionate
and more fun.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.547
So, it was...
yeah, it was epic.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.925
The first time Dave and
I hooked up, we were drunk.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.344
I was like, "What have I done?"

02:57.385 --> 02:58.928
Yeah, my ex has cheated on me,

02:58.970 --> 03:01.014
but I guess it’s not
right to cheat back.

03:01.056 --> 03:04.309
It’s not something that
I’m particularly proud of.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.894
Two espresso martinis.

03:05.935 --> 03:08.521
When we joined this boat,
the agreement that me and Tasha

03:08.563 --> 03:10.690
made was that we were gonna,
like, do a week,

03:10.732 --> 03:13.276
and then be a couple,
we’re gonna tell everyone.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.861
She just wanted some time.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.572
I feel like it’s
a ticking time bomb with Dave.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.033
I think he wants
to release the secret,

03:20.075 --> 03:25.288
but I don’t want people
to know and judge us.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.415
It’s kinda my business.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.044
Are you having another drink?

03:31.086 --> 03:33.046
We about to gonna
party it up now.

03:33.088 --> 03:35.757
Hey!

03:35.799 --> 03:37.008
Shot, shot, shot.

03:42.764 --> 03:43.932
Oh, yes.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.311
Yeah.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.312
One of them.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.772
Can I be the sandwich?

03:50.814 --> 03:52.399
-Let’s get a kiss, babe.
-Can we be a sandwich?

03:52.440 --> 03:53.525
Oh, my God!

03:53.566 --> 03:55.610
I kiss on the lips.

03:59.739 --> 04:02.367
Hold on, hold on...
I gotta take this phone call.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.119
Yeah, do that.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.330
Yeah, no, no, I’ll call...
I’ll call you right back.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.748
-Oh!
-Ah!

04:08.790 --> 04:10.875
I’ll call you right back.

04:13.294 --> 04:15.380
We’re gonna drink
and dance,

04:15.422 --> 04:16.589
Cheers, that.

04:16.631 --> 04:17.966
We’re gonna dance!

04:18.008 --> 04:19.300
All right, let’s go.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.511
We’re going, we’re going.

04:24.305 --> 04:25.849
Oh, my God, I love your toes.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.727
-Thanks, babe.
-That’s epic!

04:28.768 --> 04:31.062
Can we go to
a techno club, please?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.981
Woo-hoo!

04:34.149 --> 04:35.316
Ow!

04:38.194 --> 04:39.946
Woo!

04:47.537 --> 04:50.248
Ray-Ray is, like, living
her best life right now.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.958
She needs a pole.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.341
Are you drinking a margarita?

04:59.382 --> 05:01.301
Vodka-cranberry.

05:01.343 --> 05:04.512
Why are you sitting here
now, been far away.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.807
Will you dance with me?

05:07.849 --> 05:09.017
Yeah.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.771
Woo-hoo!

05:15.774 --> 05:18.026
You are...

05:18.068 --> 05:20.862
-Where’s Raygan?
-She’s dancing her butt off.

05:20.904 --> 05:21.863
Nice and lively.

05:37.379 --> 05:41.841
I feel like Tasha’s going out
of her way to push me away.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.760
I don’t know...
I don’t know what’s going on.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.012
Are we outta here?

05:46.054 --> 05:47.722
Come on, guys.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.265
-Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.
-I’m wasted.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.725
Hey! Hey!

05:50.767 --> 05:52.477
I know where I belong.
I know where I belong bro.

05:52.519 --> 05:53.687
I’ll get in the back.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.021
I’ll sit in the
back with Cheffy.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.273
Is everyone in the car?

05:57.315 --> 05:58.525
Woo!

06:00.985 --> 06:03.863
You and Dave, like, you guys
need to quit this bullsh--.

06:03.905 --> 06:06.032
Because I was, like,
what’s going on here?

06:06.074 --> 06:07.659
-Like, are they dating...
-Her and Dave?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.369
Or are, like, they in a fight?

06:09.411 --> 06:11.204
That’s when I have to come
in and say, pardon my French,

06:11.246 --> 06:13.206
you guys just, like,
[bleep] or something.

06:13.248 --> 06:14.207
It’s exhausting.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.208
-[bleep]
-What?

06:15.250 --> 06:16.626
Dave.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.214
We are home!

06:21.256 --> 06:23.049
Ray, are you okay, love?

06:23.091 --> 06:24.175
All right, let’s go.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.972
Oh, my God.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.057
Hey, this is a big step.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.100
Thanks, darling.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.311
Come, sweet cheeks, let’s go.

06:35.353 --> 06:38.690
All right, you know what,
I’m just gonna down.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.407
Oh!

06:47.449 --> 06:49.117
Get yourself a cheeseburger.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.079
Cheers.

06:53.121 --> 06:53.955
Are you okay, princess?

06:53.997 --> 06:55.623
Deal with drunk people enough.

07:07.594 --> 07:08.720
-Are you all right, pal?
-I’m good.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.513
-I’m good.
-Are you sure?

07:10.555 --> 07:13.224
Are you sure?
Are you all right?

07:13.266 --> 07:15.060
We’re good, buddy.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.062
-You sure?
-Yeah.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.772
-You’ve proved your point.
-Are you okay?

07:18.813 --> 07:21.983
-Yeah, I’m good.
-Ugh.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.985
Good, he’s gone.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.737
You are so funny.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.908
Obviously, you think you’re
full but you’re not.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.035
Are you all right?
Back it up.

07:33.328 --> 07:34.913
Back it up.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.833
You stopped fighting...
I’m not fighting.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.043
I’m not saying anything,
I’m just...

07:40.085 --> 07:42.545
-I just want you...
-Go to bed.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.464
Go to bed.

07:44.506 --> 07:45.965
I’ll go to my room.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.093
-Hang on, one second.
-No, don’t touch me.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.552
I’ll go to my bed.

07:49.594 --> 07:53.014
-Wash your hair, mate.
-You can go to bed.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.310
Dude, I’m too old for this.
Like, I’m not hitting you.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.479
First time I ever got knocked
out was in a Taco Bell.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.815
I was a drunk college frat kid.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.066
We were all young.

08:03.108 --> 08:05.568
But A, fighting is
just exhausting;

08:05.610 --> 08:07.946
B, do you think this
is gonna win her over?

08:07.987 --> 08:10.073
Like, this is only gonna
make it worse, mate.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.244
[shower running]

08:37.517 --> 08:39.352
Ugh.

08:39.394 --> 08:40.645
Jay?

08:40.687 --> 08:41.771
Are you okay?

08:41.813 --> 08:42.981
I’m fuming.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.607
What happened?

08:44.649 --> 08:46.860
It’s a power move, because he
was trying to get with a girl...

08:46.901 --> 08:48.111
Tasha?

08:48.153 --> 08:49.904
Yes, and because
he’s not getting the girl,

08:49.946 --> 08:51.364
-he’s trying to be an alpha.
-Correct.

08:51.406 --> 08:52.449
-Personal opinion.
-Correct.

08:52.490 --> 08:53.908
That’s 100 percent opinion.

09:24.856 --> 09:27.359
Dave’s behavior
is just not healthy.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.320
He’s a mess...
he’s drunk, he’s angry.

09:30.362 --> 09:34.741
The last thing I want to do is
share a cabin with him tonight.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.076
I just want some space.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.704
[sobbing]

09:45.293 --> 09:46.252
Coming up...

09:46.294 --> 09:47.879
Raygan, Raygan, Storm.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.091
Where’s the bosun?

09:51.132 --> 09:52.550
It’s okay to go out
and have fun,

09:52.592 --> 09:54.594
but you need to bring
it the next day.

09:54.636 --> 09:57.389
[vomiting]

10:08.233 --> 10:08.483
Yeah.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.486
My head is spinning.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.029
[alarm sounds]

10:22.706 --> 10:24.207
Oi.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.964
Good morning.

10:43.935 --> 10:46.938
I know, I completely understand
that, and I respect that.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.363
Yeah.

10:55.405 --> 10:59.159
My last night, I obviously
clearly ----ed up.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.077
I was out of order
and disrespectful.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.413
Now, Tash can’t
look at me in the eyes,

11:03.455 --> 11:04.497
and how can you blame her?

11:04.539 --> 11:05.790
Do you blame her?

11:05.832 --> 11:07.250
I can’t blame her.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.422
Okay. Thanks.

11:12.464 --> 11:13.548
Top of the morning to you.

11:13.590 --> 11:14.966
What time’d you guys get back?

11:15.008 --> 11:16.760
At 1:30, because when you
start doing somersaults

11:16.801 --> 11:20.638
on the dance floor, then you
know it’s time to round them up.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.765
Were you doing somersaults?

11:21.806 --> 11:24.559
-No, Ray.
-Raygan was?

11:24.601 --> 11:26.770
Yeah.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.271
-Cap, can I head on in?
-Yeah, of course.

11:28.313 --> 11:29.272
Thanks.

11:31.941 --> 11:37.280
All right, let’s do this,
let’s do this, let’s do this.

11:39.699 --> 11:40.992
Yes, like...

11:41.034 --> 11:42.369
You just throw it in and
then just give it to me.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.162
I’ve been here for,
like, 10 seconds.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.039
Next time you see this, this is
gonna look crisp, professional.

11:46.081 --> 11:47.207
-Yeah.
-See you later, babe.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.793
Whose are these?

11:52.504 --> 11:53.546
Kyle?

11:53.588 --> 11:55.757
Natalya, Tasha.
We should meet.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.842
Raygan, Raygan, for Storm.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.472
Raygan, Raygan, Storm.

12:02.514 --> 12:07.435
I wanna figure out where Raygan
is, so we can talk about...

12:07.477 --> 12:08.728
The game plan.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.522
[vomiting]

12:12.107 --> 12:13.358
So, I put this to-do list here.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.652
We need to change out all
the flowers,

12:15.694 --> 12:16.945
these bridge deck ones,
the main deck;

12:16.986 --> 12:18.279
we’re gonna have
to wash the vases.

12:18.321 --> 12:21.074
We need to do welcome
towels, welcome drinks.

12:21.116 --> 12:22.784
Like, dude, I’m moving
all over the place,

12:22.826 --> 12:23.993
but I’m doing nothing.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.286
No, it’s just irritating.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.249
Let’s just get a hose,

12:29.290 --> 12:31.042
and then let’s just
start rinsing, and we...

12:31.084 --> 12:32.585
I think just you and
I are gonna do it, mate.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.337
You’re the bosun, you
should understand that

12:34.379 --> 12:35.964
if you’re hungover or not,
you need to crack on.

12:36.006 --> 12:38.925
What’s important
is just to be there.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.510
Like, my sisters used
to call me their dad

12:40.552 --> 12:41.886
when they were younger,

12:41.928 --> 12:43.722
because their father was
just a piece of sh--.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.516
I used to go to the father
barbeques, you know,

12:46.558 --> 12:48.601
like where the fathers
would go to the school.

12:48.643 --> 12:50.020
It was always weird for me,

12:50.061 --> 12:52.272
because at the time I was,
like, 19, 20 years old.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.815
This is a bunch of bullsh--.

12:53.857 --> 12:55.483
Where’s the bosun?

12:55.525 --> 12:58.278
I’m just gonna have to crack
on with the duties at hand,

12:58.319 --> 13:01.072
because laziness
makes me frustrated.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.616
Ah!

13:03.658 --> 13:05.660
Congratulations on being the
third stew in the laundry.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.620
I mean, I have to literally
talk with Tash later,

13:07.662 --> 13:09.998
because you’re gonna have to
get demoted to fourth stew.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.666
Let me tell you
something about me...

13:11.708 --> 13:13.543
you’ll never catch me
in that position.

13:13.585 --> 13:16.588
I am as strong...

13:19.507 --> 13:22.510
Literally, that was so close,
I would have died.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.096
Have you seen the deck crew?
You seen Jason?

13:25.138 --> 13:28.058
-He’s up on bridge deck.
-Bridge deck.

13:29.059 --> 13:32.103
* Everyone’s falling to pieces *

13:33.730 --> 13:36.024
-Jason?
-Yo!

13:36.066 --> 13:38.151
Hey, man, I’m sorry
about last night, bro.

13:38.193 --> 13:40.111
I didn’t mean to offend you
in any way whatsoever.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.571
-Um...
-Just so you know.

13:41.613 --> 13:42.947
-Yeah, yeah,
-I know you don’t mean to.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.366
Regardless, I apologize,

13:44.407 --> 13:46.701
and that’s sincere,
as sincere as it goes.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.870
-Uh...
-So, and I’m sorry.

13:48.912 --> 13:50.372
No, you’re...

13:50.413 --> 13:52.957
-I’m really sorry, man.
-I appreciate the apology.

13:57.087 --> 13:58.505
[snoring]

14:00.799 --> 14:02.509
Would you like coffee?

14:02.550 --> 14:03.551
I’m gonna make you one.

14:03.593 --> 14:04.928
Oh, yeah?

14:08.598 --> 14:10.266
<i>David, Natasha, Raygan,</i>

14:10.308 --> 14:12.394
let’s meet in the crew mess for
our preference sheet meeting.

14:12.435 --> 14:13.520
<i>Copy that.</i>

14:14.604 --> 14:16.564
Copy.

14:16.606 --> 14:19.734
That is the best I can do
with the equipment we have...

14:19.776 --> 14:22.112
-Sorry.
-Thank you.

14:23.405 --> 14:24.656
Oh, babe.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.033
So, where have you been?

14:27.992 --> 14:30.328
That’s called a "hangover."

14:31.788 --> 14:33.915
Nah... it’s alcohol.

14:33.957 --> 14:36.167
Don’t kid yourself.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.211
When you’re in charge
of a deck crew,

14:38.253 --> 14:40.588
the last thing you wanna
do on the second charter

14:40.630 --> 14:42.882
is show them
that you’re incapacitated

14:42.924 --> 14:44.342
from your hangover.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.011
It’s okay to go out
and have fun,

14:46.052 --> 14:47.637
but you need
to bring it the next day.

14:47.679 --> 14:50.432
We begin charter today.
We’ve gotta step it up.

14:50.473 --> 14:51.599
[coughs]

14:51.641 --> 14:52.934
Charter number two...

14:52.976 --> 14:54.728
Emily Butler works
for her family’s business,

14:54.769 --> 14:55.979
Butler and Associates.

14:56.021 --> 14:57.439
As a real estate agent,

14:57.480 --> 14:59.441
Emily is chartering with
some of her best friends.

14:59.482 --> 15:02.527
This charter’s top priority
includes a bar fully stocked,

15:02.569 --> 15:05.780
and spending sunup to
sundown in the water.

15:05.822 --> 15:09.284
They’re also looking to have a
Moroccan-inspired sunset dinner.

15:09.325 --> 15:10.660
That food is so good.

15:10.702 --> 15:12.120
Yeah, Moroccan food
is super good.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.455
-Yeah.
-Super simple and delicious.

15:13.496 --> 15:16.374
-Mm-hmm...
-One of ’em hates seafood.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.168
You can jump here
any time there.

15:20.462 --> 15:22.630
All the water toys
will be in the water.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.761
Note... water sports,
water sports, water sports.

15:27.802 --> 15:28.970
Yeah, yeah.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.180
First charter
was a hard charter,

15:30.221 --> 15:31.389
-getting to know the boat.
-Yeah.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.600
I expect you to pull
out every toy...

15:33.641 --> 15:35.101
Yeah.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.896
Everything in the
water, first thing.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.731
Because that’ll make me mad.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.026
All right, thank you.

15:45.362 --> 15:48.448
Laundry, laundry, laundry.

15:51.368 --> 15:53.745
What’s the plan, are we
just gonna do a wash-down?

16:39.499 --> 16:40.583
Ta?

17:43.938 --> 17:44.314
Provisions?

17:45.857 --> 17:48.068
All crew, all crew,
provisions are on the dock.

17:48.109 --> 17:49.319
Copy.

17:50.195 --> 17:51.613
Beer and wines in the laz.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.281
All right, yes, ma’am.

17:53.323 --> 17:54.741
What’s that one, Jason?

17:54.783 --> 17:56.201
Hard liquor.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.413
I’ll be out in a minute.

18:03.708 --> 18:07.087
Well, it’s definitely more
organized than last time.

18:07.128 --> 18:09.172
The power team, the couple.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.173
Who’s the couple?

18:10.215 --> 18:11.841
You and Dave.

18:11.883 --> 18:13.677
Come on, you guys are so ----ing
in love, it’s not even funny.

18:13.718 --> 18:16.846
Why do you think that?
Don’t start rumors.

18:20.225 --> 18:21.768
If you two don’t work out,

18:21.810 --> 18:23.436
it’s always me
and you till then.

18:23.478 --> 18:26.147
All right, well,
until then, I’m with you.

18:26.189 --> 18:27.315
I hope you’re right, mate.

18:29.150 --> 18:30.694
Ugh.

18:30.735 --> 18:33.154
Okay we’ve still got space,
we’re still good.

18:33.196 --> 18:34.864
[chatters]

18:34.906 --> 18:38.243
I need to grab lotion,
I need to grab slippers.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.370
So, I’m gonna make
mini-margaritas.

18:40.412 --> 18:43.331
Then I wanna do a pineapple
upside-down cake shot.

18:43.373 --> 18:44.749
Okay.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.503
Captain, Raygan.

18:50.672 --> 18:52.465
Very nice.

18:52.507 --> 18:54.968
<i>All crew, all crew,</i>
<i>get into your whites,</i>

18:55.010 --> 18:57.637
<i>we have five minutes</i>
<i>to meet on the dock.</i>

19:00.849 --> 19:02.976
All right,
I’ll see you up there.

19:03.018 --> 19:04.602
-Get everything set up.
-Yeah.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.895
Inflated.

19:05.937 --> 19:08.398
The first charter,
it was just me and Jason.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.733
I was all over the place.

19:09.774 --> 19:11.359
I didn’t have time
to do a schedule,

19:11.401 --> 19:13.153
I didn’t have time
to arrange anything.

19:13.194 --> 19:15.905
Then this morning
I have a very bad hangover.

19:15.947 --> 19:17.574
I understand
it’s not professional,

19:17.615 --> 19:18.908
it doesn’t look good.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.494
But now we actually
have the whole team.

19:24.414 --> 19:26.499
Yes, chef next to me.

19:26.541 --> 19:27.917
Stormy, make sure
you keep your hands

19:27.959 --> 19:29.627
-to yourself this charter, hey?
-Yeah.

19:32.922 --> 19:36.092
We should have been way
more intoxicated for this.

19:36.134 --> 19:37.385
Okay, here we go.

19:37.427 --> 19:39.095
-Hey, guys.
-Welcome!

19:39.137 --> 19:40.597
-Hello, guys!
-Hi!

19:40.638 --> 19:42.015
-I’m Emily, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

19:42.057 --> 19:43.224
-Welcome aboard.
-Noah.

19:43.266 --> 19:44.601
Noah, nice to meet
you, welcome.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.519
Hi, I’m Natasha,
lovely to meet you.

19:46.561 --> 19:48.104
All of our shoes.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.482
Welcome aboard Motor Yacht Home.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.525
Our chief stew, Natasha,
is gonna show you around,

19:52.567 --> 19:54.277
-gonna show you the boat.
-Awesome.

19:54.319 --> 19:56.279
-Perfect, thank you.
-Love it.

19:56.321 --> 19:57.280
Should I slip my shoes off?

19:57.322 --> 19:58.782
Yeah, yeah.

19:58.823 --> 20:01.826
-We have the margaritas...
-We need to keep ’em coming!

20:01.868 --> 20:04.496
And here, a
pineapple upside-down

20:04.537 --> 20:06.122
cake shot that
everyone must try.

20:06.164 --> 20:08.958
-Oh, hey!
-Oh, no!

20:09.000 --> 20:11.044
All right, so we’re gonna head
this way

20:11.086 --> 20:12.837
to the start of the tour.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.090
Oh, my God,
this boat is beautiful.

20:17.676 --> 20:19.344
This is the bridge deck aft.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.971
This is probably where you’re
gonna eat most of your meals.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.437
And then if we head up
to the sundeck...

20:29.479 --> 20:31.356
This is so cool.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.400
Oh, yeah, we’ll be up here.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.528
The amount of beers
that I’m gonna be

20:36.569 --> 20:37.779
drinking on this deck is...

20:37.821 --> 20:39.572
Absurd.

20:39.614 --> 20:41.908
All right, so, we
can head this way.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.535
Ooh, posh, posh.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.412
Oh, it’s so sweet!

20:45.453 --> 20:47.414
Here comes the luggage.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.333
Got it?

20:50.375 --> 20:53.211
Ah!

20:53.253 --> 20:55.588
Oh, it’s such art.

20:55.630 --> 20:57.257
It’s all handmade,
like ciabatta,

20:57.298 --> 21:00.844
this is rosemary focaccia,
got a feta and pine nut quiche.

21:00.885 --> 21:04.180
Some of the chefs
I’ve had were incredible.

21:04.222 --> 21:06.182
It’s miso-glazed salmon.

21:06.224 --> 21:08.351
-Cajun shrimp?
-It’s a Cajun-style shrimp.

21:08.393 --> 21:09.769
Yay!

21:09.811 --> 21:11.187
All right...
okay, thank you guys.

21:11.229 --> 21:13.148
I feel like we make
him nervous, I like it.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.858
Yeah, it’s all good.

21:14.899 --> 21:18.820
But Dave is like no other chef
I’ve ever had on the planet.

21:18.862 --> 21:20.780
Like, he is the true artist.

21:20.822 --> 21:22.907
It’s incredible to
witness this guy at work.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.743
I’m gonna try to keep it
smooth for you underway.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.870
-Thank you, I appreciate it.
-Yeah, yeah.

21:26.911 --> 21:28.413
Is there anything else
in that other van, or no?

21:28.455 --> 21:29.664
-No.
-Oh, nice.

21:29.706 --> 21:31.332
Less luggage than
the last people.

21:31.374 --> 21:33.710
-So, here we have the VIP suite.
-Wow.

21:33.752 --> 21:35.712
And then we have the
other two cabins down here.

21:35.754 --> 21:37.255
It’s so nice!

21:37.297 --> 21:38.798
Who’s in here?

21:38.840 --> 21:40.175
Well, you’re in charge,
you tell who’s in who.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.010
You guys can fight for it.

21:42.052 --> 21:43.303
I’m out of it.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.180
I can stay with Tommy,
because we’re family.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.557
-Okay.
-So, we’re gonna share the twin.

21:47.599 --> 21:49.059
-That makes the most sense.
-Okay.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.185
All luggage on board.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.394
Okay, thank you.

21:51.436 --> 21:53.688
You guys can single up
on the bowlines.

21:55.065 --> 21:56.733
Black.

21:56.775 --> 21:58.860
Port side lines are in board.

21:58.902 --> 22:00.570
And then for drinks orders?

22:00.612 --> 22:01.905
Any hard seltzer?

22:01.946 --> 22:03.615
I’ll just take
a glass of champagne.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.241
Okay, all lines free,
all lines free.

22:05.283 --> 22:06.743
Thank you.

22:06.785 --> 22:08.787
I’ll do a Corona and
then one shot for everyone.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.748
For the guests.

22:11.790 --> 22:12.582
The guy?

22:12.624 --> 22:13.875
What do you think so far?

22:13.917 --> 22:15.377
You know what
I’m thinking, right?

22:15.418 --> 22:17.420
You’re gonna be working
for me soon.

22:17.462 --> 22:20.131
-I’m gonna what?
-Be working for me.

22:20.173 --> 22:21.132
I’m gonna be your boss.

22:23.301 --> 22:24.386
Then I’ll be your boss.

22:24.427 --> 22:26.471
[laughing]

22:26.513 --> 22:28.431
Oh, that is actually fire.

22:28.473 --> 22:30.100
Natalya, Natalya, Tasha.

22:30.141 --> 22:31.935
You wanna flip laundry?

22:31.976 --> 22:33.144
Copy.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.271
And then Kyle,
give me a hand with drinks.

22:35.313 --> 22:36.898
Copy that.

22:38.817 --> 22:40.944
<i>We’re all clear to go.</i>

22:40.985 --> 22:43.655
On the port side,
we have 12 meters.

22:43.697 --> 22:45.699
This is a legit boat.

22:45.740 --> 22:48.118
Port side dolphin, one meter.

22:48.159 --> 22:49.661
This is just so beautiful.

22:49.703 --> 22:51.955
Port side dolphin
now clear from stern.

22:51.996 --> 22:53.164
Bow is all clear.

22:53.206 --> 22:55.333
<i>Thank you, Mzi, Raygan...</i>
<i>good job.</i>

22:55.375 --> 22:56.501
Thank you.

22:58.169 --> 22:59.796
Okay.

22:59.838 --> 23:01.256
Are you going to give me
a hand with the drinks?

23:01.297 --> 23:03.299
-Yeah, ma’am.
-All right, darling.

23:03.341 --> 23:04.426
Okay, babe!

23:04.467 --> 23:06.094
You wanna do the shots?

23:06.136 --> 23:07.303
Okay.

23:07.345 --> 23:09.139
And then once you’ve done
the shots, hon,

23:09.180 --> 23:11.558
steal the big bucket that
had the Coronas and put,

23:11.599 --> 23:14.269
like, loads of little bottles
of still and sparkling in it.

23:14.310 --> 23:15.520
Sure.

23:18.189 --> 23:20.150
Can you just start letting
these out?

23:20.191 --> 23:21.276
Yeah.

23:21.317 --> 23:23.028
Here we go again, guys.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.533
It’s a beautiful day.
It’s amazing.

23:32.370 --> 23:34.539
We’ll Titanic this bitch.

23:34.581 --> 23:35.874
Okay, then, guys.

23:39.502 --> 23:40.670
Let’s do it.

23:44.174 --> 23:45.800
Ooh!

23:45.842 --> 23:47.302
-Skittles!
-Here we are, loves.

23:47.344 --> 23:48.595
Wow!

23:48.636 --> 23:50.513
Are we doing paddleboards?

23:50.555 --> 23:52.057
Or is that something we can
at least

23:52.098 --> 23:54.517
ask the guests before we do it,
or do we just do it?

23:54.559 --> 23:55.894
No.

24:00.899 --> 24:01.941
Cheers!

24:01.983 --> 24:03.360
Cheers to the
beginning of the end.

24:03.401 --> 24:04.569
-Yay!
-Yeah.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.780
I love this!

24:06.821 --> 24:09.157
Let me get the Seabobs out.

24:10.909 --> 24:13.244
-Oh, no.
-What’s up?

24:15.955 --> 24:16.915
What?

24:22.087 --> 24:25.715
I don’t even know
where they charge... or how.

24:25.757 --> 24:28.009
I never once have
unplugged anything,

24:28.051 --> 24:30.345
so I guess I just thought
they were fueled with gasoline.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.306
That’s my apologies, man.

24:36.518 --> 24:37.894
Our man’s back!

24:37.936 --> 24:39.979
-Oh sh--!
-The man of the hour.

24:40.021 --> 24:41.439
-Thank you!
-You’re welcome.

24:41.481 --> 24:44.609
-They weren’t on charge.
-They weren’t on charge?

24:46.778 --> 24:48.279
Yeah, I didn’t know,
I thought these were gas.

24:50.073 --> 24:51.616
Yeah, I didn’t even
know it was there.

24:53.201 --> 24:55.203
I’ve only been on a boat
for, like, five days,

24:55.245 --> 24:57.706
and it is a cluster[bleep]
right now.

24:59.624 --> 25:00.917
And I’m getting a
little irritated,

25:00.959 --> 25:02.877
because no
one’s leading.

25:08.550 --> 25:09.926
Coming up...

25:09.968 --> 25:11.261
Whee!

25:13.013 --> 25:14.597
I’ve seen how much you have
consumed,

25:14.639 --> 25:16.349
and congratulations for
staying up so long.

25:26.067 --> 25:27.402
After this, I’m gonna go have
a look at Venice, Milan.

25:28.903 --> 25:30.572
I’m gonna go find
a husband somewhere.

25:30.613 --> 25:33.700
Oh, so you’re
not marrying Tash?

25:33.742 --> 25:35.535
I’m gay as hell, babe.

25:35.577 --> 25:36.745
[laughing]

25:37.871 --> 25:39.414
I mean, I would totally.

25:39.456 --> 25:42.709
Anchor down, let’s go
to three shackles.

25:42.751 --> 25:44.002
<i>Copy.</i>

25:47.922 --> 25:49.424
Three shackles in the water.

25:49.466 --> 25:51.259
<i>Great, lock it down there.</i>

25:51.301 --> 25:52.427
<i>Copy that.</i>

25:52.469 --> 25:53.386
<i>-Good job.</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>

25:55.347 --> 25:57.432
Cool, cool, let’s get the crane
ready, and let’s start moving.

25:57.474 --> 25:59.017
-Yeah.
-Do the jet-skis first?

25:59.059 --> 26:00.518
Yeah.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.104
Put that in there.

26:03.146 --> 26:05.482
There, pop that in there,
pop that in there.

26:06.941 --> 26:08.193
Pop this.

26:08.234 --> 26:09.861
I am the most organized
person in my family.

26:09.903 --> 26:13.239
I would always rearrange my
room when I’m little, and, like,

26:13.281 --> 26:15.742
move cabinets and cupboards
and color-coordinate.

26:15.784 --> 26:20.205
My pantry back home in Australia
is, like, plastic containers,

26:20.246 --> 26:22.332
it’s got all labels on there,
everything’s got a home.

26:22.374 --> 26:24.709
So, that’s why I’m, like,
I love laundry.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.211
It’s my area, it’s my spot.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.421
I just like to have
everything organized my way.

26:32.634 --> 26:33.968
Explain to me what
we’re gonna do first?

26:34.010 --> 26:35.428
We’re gonna pump this up,

26:35.470 --> 26:37.097
then we’re gonna start
feeding that through.

26:37.138 --> 26:39.057
Then we’re gonna
have to tie lines on.

26:39.099 --> 26:40.141
Gotcha.

26:40.183 --> 26:41.267
I like to think personally
that I am

26:41.309 --> 26:42.894
a little bit more
than green now.

26:42.936 --> 26:44.771
I’ve gained a lot of
knowledge last year,

26:44.813 --> 26:46.856
so I feel a lot more
confident to sort

26:46.898 --> 26:49.025
of take more authority
in situations.

26:50.110 --> 26:51.236
Okay.

26:51.277 --> 26:54.739
Also, with Raygan,
there’s miles to go.

26:54.781 --> 26:55.907
Good.

27:00.328 --> 27:01.996
Noah’s where he’s meant to be.

27:02.038 --> 27:03.707
-He’s living his best life.
-Mm-hmm.

27:03.748 --> 27:05.291
In 22 years.

27:05.333 --> 27:07.961
I was just thinking that...
how the hell did I get here?

27:08.003 --> 27:09.671
-Let’s go get in our swimmies.
-Yeah.

27:09.713 --> 27:10.672
You’re getting antsy-pantsy.

27:10.714 --> 27:11.923
Do you guys wanna go change?

27:11.965 --> 27:14.759
-Yeah.
-Yee-hoo-hoo!

27:14.801 --> 27:16.302
I’ll ask him if he’s already--

27:16.344 --> 27:17.929
Good job, you.

27:17.971 --> 27:19.931
Aw, I’m so proud of you.

27:19.973 --> 27:22.267
I’m proud of you, too.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.477
-You should try some of this.
-Can I?

27:24.519 --> 27:25.895
Yeah, dip it in this.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.774
Mm, I like this one.

27:29.816 --> 27:32.110
-Have you eaten today?
-No.

27:32.152 --> 27:34.279
Then eat something.

27:34.320 --> 27:38.283
I honestly think Dave and
Tash are such a cute couple.

27:38.324 --> 27:43.204
I’m seeing her smile and be all
dainty around Dave, ha, ha, ha.

27:43.246 --> 27:46.082
And then seeing Dave being
so soft around her,

27:46.124 --> 27:47.834
because he just melts
into Jell-O,

27:47.876 --> 27:52.172
I’m like no, my sus is up,
something’s going on here.

27:55.842 --> 27:57.385
Can you hear it,
am I going through?

27:58.636 --> 28:01.014
Oh [bleep] man.

28:03.391 --> 28:04.726
You’ve just gotta change it.

28:04.768 --> 28:06.019
I did.

28:06.061 --> 28:08.355
The derrick can be
really annoying,

28:08.396 --> 28:11.232
because there’s different
pins and different heads

28:11.274 --> 28:13.109
for the jet-ski and the tender.

28:13.151 --> 28:14.736
So, you have
to change it every time.

28:14.778 --> 28:17.947
And on this boat, the pin
doesn’t come out very easy.

28:17.989 --> 28:19.824
It’s stuck, so you’re, like...

28:19.866 --> 28:21.910
it can take you, like,
20 minutes,

28:21.951 --> 28:23.536
half an hour
to actually change it.

28:23.578 --> 28:24.996
I’m sweating like hell.

28:25.038 --> 28:26.915
It’s taken us
an hour to do this.

28:26.956 --> 28:28.875
Hi.

28:35.382 --> 28:37.550
Wait, I wanna get on that.
What are we doing?

28:37.592 --> 28:39.010
We’ve got a couple
more inflatables

28:39.052 --> 28:40.845
that we can actually...

28:40.887 --> 28:43.390
<i>-Mzi, Mzi, Raygan.</i>
<i>-Go ahead, Raygan.</i>

28:46.601 --> 28:48.228
It’s gonna be a while.

28:48.269 --> 28:49.896
I’m not gonna be
jumping in right now.

28:49.938 --> 28:52.232
Has the banana been
blown up?

28:52.273 --> 28:55.110
No, we just finished
off the NautiBuoys.

28:55.151 --> 28:56.945
<i>Jason, Jason, Raygan.</i>

28:56.986 --> 28:59.197
The banana should
have been inflated.

28:59.239 --> 29:01.408
Sh--’s gonna go down.

29:03.702 --> 29:05.036
We’re putting that one out.

29:05.078 --> 29:06.663
You told me to get
the banana boat.

29:06.705 --> 29:08.707
This is the new one, I told you
we swapped the old one out.

29:08.748 --> 29:09.874
-Yeah.
-We need...

29:09.916 --> 29:10.917
can you go help
him with the eFoil?

29:10.959 --> 29:12.210
I’ll do the banana.

29:12.252 --> 29:13.712
I’ll do what my boss
tells me to do.

29:13.753 --> 29:15.213
Okay, but I’ve told you
that this went into the bow.

29:15.255 --> 29:16.423
Yeah.

29:16.464 --> 29:18.133
That’s why we swapped
the other one out.

29:18.174 --> 29:19.676
-Where’s the other one?
-The other one’s in--

29:19.718 --> 29:21.344
it is, where all the thing is,
it slid into the side.

29:21.386 --> 29:22.929
-Yeah, it’s already in there.
-Got it.

29:22.971 --> 29:24.639
Yee!
Ha ha ha!

29:26.891 --> 29:28.226
Should we go out here?

29:28.268 --> 29:30.812
Before you get in,
let us get a ladder down.

29:30.854 --> 29:32.188
Okay.

29:32.230 --> 29:33.732
Unless you’re okay
just stepping off.

29:33.773 --> 29:35.025
-No, that’s fine.
-Oh, yeah, we’re fine.

29:35.066 --> 29:36.234
Okay.

29:36.276 --> 29:37.527
They’re literally
waiting around.

29:40.447 --> 29:42.365
For tonight, I’ll just
have to print the menu.

29:42.407 --> 29:45.702
Give me an hour, and then
I’ll have it written.

29:45.744 --> 29:47.203
Yeah.

29:47.245 --> 29:50.790
-All right, sweet.
-I’ll be back.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.125
Why is the passarelle
not out?

29:52.167 --> 29:53.251
We haven’t brought it out yet.

29:53.293 --> 29:54.919
I can see that, but obviously,

29:54.961 --> 29:58.256
you guys need to sort this
out while we’re on the bow.

29:58.298 --> 29:59.632
We’ve been doing
all the inflatables.

29:59.674 --> 30:01.092
If you don’t want us
to do inflatables

30:01.134 --> 30:02.677
and deal with the passarelle,

30:02.719 --> 30:04.721
just tell us exactly what
order you want us to do it in.

30:04.763 --> 30:07.390
This should always be out
before you put the toys in.

30:10.477 --> 30:11.895
Can you move that
out of the way?

30:11.936 --> 30:13.271
I’ll move it out of the way.

30:13.313 --> 30:15.148
Can you put the
eFoil in the water, please,

30:15.190 --> 30:16.775
because it’s a bit heavy.

30:16.816 --> 30:19.194
Raygan, where’s the inflatables?

30:19.235 --> 30:20.278
Start blowing them up.

30:20.320 --> 30:21.654
Let’s do that now.

30:25.825 --> 30:27.035
I’m doing it, yeah, sorry.

30:27.077 --> 30:28.620
This one’s ready.

30:28.661 --> 30:30.246
You got the towline for this?
No, that’s not it.

30:30.288 --> 30:31.956
Do you remember where
you put the towline?

30:31.998 --> 30:33.500
Is it...

30:33.541 --> 30:36.127
I’ve never inflated this or
seen it in my life.

30:37.253 --> 30:39.172
Oh, yeah, awesome, there ya go.

30:39.214 --> 30:41.216
Would one of you guys like
to go for a tow on this,

30:41.257 --> 30:42.217
on the back of the tender?

30:42.258 --> 30:43.551
Yeah, just get it in the water.

30:43.593 --> 30:46.221
-Everything in the water.
-There you go.

30:50.308 --> 30:52.769
You gotta organize
your team, okay?

30:52.811 --> 30:53.853
Yeah, I know.

30:53.895 --> 30:55.271
It’s complete chaos back there.

30:55.313 --> 30:56.815
-I know, I can see that.
-So, here’s what I want.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.274
I know, I told them
to get everything out,

30:58.316 --> 31:00.318
because we was doing
the jet-skis.

31:00.360 --> 31:02.987
Yeah, but you were sitting
there watching him hammer that.

31:03.029 --> 31:04.614
You should have been
back here, working.

31:04.656 --> 31:06.157
-Yeah, I...
-I don’t need you on the bow.

31:06.199 --> 31:07.492
Yeah, of course.

31:07.534 --> 31:08.660
I need you back here,
managing this.

31:08.702 --> 31:09.452
Mm-hmm.

31:09.494 --> 31:10.787
You have to organize them,

31:10.829 --> 31:11.996
you have to give them
directives, okay?

31:12.038 --> 31:13.039
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

31:13.081 --> 31:14.666
You need that banana blown up,

31:14.708 --> 31:15.834
and you always wanna do it
out of the way of the guests.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.335
Yes, of course, yeah.

31:17.377 --> 31:20.255
So, two people standing
there talking about a tube...

31:21.881 --> 31:23.550
No, no, no, I don’t
wanna hear you complain.

31:23.591 --> 31:24.843
-Yeah.
-I wanna see you do your job.

31:24.884 --> 31:26.219
-Okay, yeah, yeah.
-Okay?

31:36.604 --> 31:37.355
Jason, you let Storm do that.

31:38.440 --> 31:39.566
I’m gonna get the banana out.

31:39.607 --> 31:40.817
Okay?

31:40.859 --> 31:42.736
You should pumping up,
where’s the...

31:42.777 --> 31:44.404
Right there.

31:50.952 --> 31:52.370
She’s in over her head.

31:57.417 --> 31:59.210
What do you think I was doing?

32:02.380 --> 32:04.549
Do you think I was just sitting
back here, twiddling my thumbs?

32:04.591 --> 32:06.092
But you’re telling me to do
stuff,

32:06.134 --> 32:07.552
I’m getting all the
inflatables ready,

32:07.594 --> 32:09.012
then you start bitching me
for the passarelle.

32:09.054 --> 32:10.638
So, pick something to
bitch about me

32:10.680 --> 32:12.057
and then go for it.

32:12.098 --> 32:13.558
But don’t come back and say...

32:13.600 --> 32:16.936
start nitpicking 30 different
things out of order.

32:16.978 --> 32:19.356
Like, I’m telling you, like,
we were doing our best.

32:22.984 --> 32:24.110
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

32:24.152 --> 32:25.278
Yeah?

32:28.990 --> 32:30.492
You should see your face.

32:30.533 --> 32:31.534
What’s wrong with it?

32:31.576 --> 32:33.912
You look super stressed-out.

32:33.953 --> 32:35.413
Cheers, bro, appreciate it.

32:35.455 --> 32:39.125
Laundry, laundry,

32:39.167 --> 32:42.128
it’s your friend,
it never ends...

32:42.170 --> 32:43.546
laundry!

32:47.676 --> 32:51.137
[bleep].

32:51.179 --> 32:52.806
[shouting]

32:54.599 --> 32:56.267
[laughing]

32:58.019 --> 32:59.646
Dinner menu.

32:59.688 --> 33:02.774
Octopus with cucumber
and sesame,

33:02.816 --> 33:05.193
braised pig’s cheek,

33:05.235 --> 33:07.153
and dessert
is a chocolate bombe.

33:07.195 --> 33:09.239
And I’ll come up and explain it.

33:09.280 --> 33:11.825
-Okay. Happy?
-Happy.

33:11.866 --> 33:13.118
I love experimenting.

33:13.159 --> 33:15.912
I’ve got some octopus on
the preference sheets.

33:15.954 --> 33:18.498
There’s a few people that
didn’t like seafood,

33:18.540 --> 33:20.709
but I don’t follow preferences.

33:20.750 --> 33:22.252
It’s always a bit of a gamble.

33:22.293 --> 33:24.170
[bleep] me that’s hot.

33:24.212 --> 33:25.880
I do so much extreme stuff.

33:25.922 --> 33:29.259
I could be in an avalanche,
or my chute’s not gonna open

33:29.300 --> 33:30.677
when I jump out the plane,

33:30.719 --> 33:33.013
or I do a base jump and
my cord’s gonna twist.

33:33.054 --> 33:36.266
So, yeah, I do gamble.

33:36.307 --> 33:37.517
Are you gonna
hop in the shower?

33:37.559 --> 33:38.351
Yeah.

33:38.393 --> 33:39.644
Tash, what am I doing?

33:39.686 --> 33:41.521
Okay, well, we need
to set the table.

33:41.563 --> 33:42.564
Okay.

33:45.025 --> 33:48.403
Red wine deep, okay.

33:50.196 --> 33:51.489
We could take
out the crane.

33:51.531 --> 33:53.241
I could swim it to
the side of the boat.

33:53.283 --> 33:54.576
I’ll meet you there, Storm.

33:55.910 --> 33:57.912
I definitely get my
passion from my mother.

33:57.954 --> 34:00.540
She’d had to be fierce
because of her life.

34:00.582 --> 34:03.376
I just remember, like,
my mom being so tired.

34:03.418 --> 34:06.171
She’d work a full 8:00
to 6:00 job,

34:06.212 --> 34:08.173
and then when my first
sister was born,

34:08.214 --> 34:11.301
I was 14 or 15, the only way
my sister could sleep

34:11.343 --> 34:12.927
is if we drove her
around in the car.

34:12.969 --> 34:15.680
But my mum would be so wrecked
that I would have to drive her,

34:15.722 --> 34:17.057
which is not legal at all.

34:17.098 --> 34:19.059
But, like, I just tap
into this work mode,

34:19.100 --> 34:20.894
and once I hit it, like, I go.

34:20.935 --> 34:22.270
Okay, up I go.

34:27.567 --> 34:31.154
Mzi and Jason, are you able to
please make your way to galley?

34:31.196 --> 34:32.822
Whee!

34:32.864 --> 34:34.699
-Are we ready?
-Okay, quickly, service plan.

34:34.741 --> 34:35.492
Yeah.

34:35.533 --> 34:36.910
Me and Mzi will walk left,

34:36.951 --> 34:38.787
Jason will be in front
of you and walk right.

34:38.828 --> 34:40.038
Yeah.

34:40.080 --> 34:42.165
And Kyle, can you check
the napkins are removed

34:42.207 --> 34:44.292
-from the place settings?
-Sure, that’ll I’ll do.

34:44.334 --> 34:45.293
Then run back down.

34:45.335 --> 34:46.753
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

34:46.795 --> 34:49.255
Just watch me, and when
I put my first plate down,

34:49.297 --> 34:50.590
just go with yours as well.

34:50.632 --> 34:52.842
Are we ready
to get this party started?

34:52.884 --> 34:54.094
Yes!

34:54.135 --> 34:55.178
Is my face dry right here?

34:55.220 --> 34:57.013
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

34:57.055 --> 34:58.515
I’m gonna remove this,

34:58.556 --> 35:00.308
then it’s easier for us to
put that plate down.

35:00.350 --> 35:01.518
Here we are.

35:01.559 --> 35:03.186
-Like, white stuff?
-Is that...

35:03.228 --> 35:04.187
No, no, no, there’s
no white stuff.

35:04.229 --> 35:05.438
-Okay.
-No.

35:05.480 --> 35:06.481
Don’t need to put
anything on it?

35:06.523 --> 35:07.482
-No, no, no.
-Okay.

35:07.524 --> 35:08.733
-No white stuff.
-Thanks.

35:08.775 --> 35:10.110
-Are you ready, guys?
-Yeah.

35:10.151 --> 35:11.945
I don’t even know
what’s on the menu.

35:11.986 --> 35:13.071
I’m just getting it.

35:13.113 --> 35:14.114
The menu is in front of you.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.448
We’re not gonna...

35:15.490 --> 35:16.700
It’s too much to read
right now, okay?

35:16.741 --> 35:18.827
Are they sitting
down for dinner?

35:25.417 --> 35:27.168
Oh, I would love to!

35:27.210 --> 35:30.005
Yay!

35:31.339 --> 35:32.549
Sit down!

35:32.590 --> 35:34.050
Tell me about yourself,
you live in...

35:35.176 --> 35:36.344
Yeah?

35:41.933 --> 35:42.976
That’s awesome.

35:43.018 --> 35:44.477
Cheers to that!

35:44.519 --> 35:46.354
Bye, Captain Sandy.

35:46.396 --> 35:50.483
Okay, twice-cooked octopus with
pea puree and sesame, okay?

35:51.401 --> 35:52.944
To Tommy.

35:55.488 --> 35:57.949
Here we have
the twice-cooked octopus.

35:57.991 --> 35:59.993
I do not like octopus.

36:00.035 --> 36:02.704
Oh sh--.

36:02.746 --> 36:04.706
If this is good,
this guy’s amazing.

36:04.748 --> 36:06.124
All right, you’re up next.

36:09.627 --> 36:11.921
I mean, I wouldn’t order
it again, but it’s good.

36:11.963 --> 36:13.131
Ah!

36:13.173 --> 36:14.799
The way he prepared it
was really fabulous,

36:14.841 --> 36:16.718
because it can be chewy
like rubbery.

36:16.760 --> 36:17.927
-Calamari is squid, yes?
-Yeah.

36:17.969 --> 36:18.970
Yummy in my tummy.

36:20.388 --> 36:21.514
Where does this bad boy go?

36:21.556 --> 36:22.599
Bottom drawer.

36:22.640 --> 36:23.850
Hey, Captain Sandy.

36:25.935 --> 36:27.812
No direction?

36:42.410 --> 36:43.995
You know, it’s hard, isn’t it?

36:44.037 --> 36:50.001
So, you had someone you worked
under that was very experienced,

36:50.043 --> 36:52.212
to someone who doesn’t
have as much experience.

36:52.253 --> 36:53.296
Yeah.

36:53.338 --> 36:54.673
Mzi’s done a season with me.

36:54.714 --> 36:56.758
He understands what
I expect from my crew.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.219
And the bosun’s job is
to teach her deck crew.

36:59.260 --> 37:02.430
We can stage towels, chairs,
and the shoe basket.

37:02.472 --> 37:03.973
Malia, do you wanna put
the swim ladder in?

37:04.015 --> 37:05.558
No, but good question.

37:05.600 --> 37:08.561
You have to be able
to lead your team,

37:08.603 --> 37:10.230
and that means
giving them direction.

37:10.271 --> 37:13.024
Raygan’s not really
demonstrating leadership.

37:13.066 --> 37:16.152
At this point, I’m just hoping
to get through this charter.

37:16.194 --> 37:18.905
It’s a bit disjointed.

37:18.947 --> 37:20.740
If there’s structure
and direction,

37:20.782 --> 37:22.742
I think it could make
a bit more of a difference.

37:26.621 --> 37:27.914
Coming up...

37:27.956 --> 37:29.332
-Noah!
-Tommy!

37:29.374 --> 37:30.625
So tired.

37:30.667 --> 37:32.752
-Hey!
-Oh!

37:41.720 --> 37:43.179
What are those?

37:47.517 --> 37:49.019
-You going down?
-Yeah.

37:49.060 --> 37:50.311
Sounds good, sleep well.

37:50.353 --> 37:52.605
So, next course, pork cheek.

37:55.066 --> 37:56.026
You’re drunk.

37:58.862 --> 37:59.988
Oh sh--.

38:00.030 --> 38:01.489
I’ve seen how much you
have consumed,

38:01.531 --> 38:03.116
and congratulations for
staying up so long.

38:07.203 --> 38:09.080
Oh, my...

38:09.122 --> 38:12.709
Tommy, come here, come here,
let’s go for a little walk.

38:14.294 --> 38:15.337
Come here.

38:15.378 --> 38:16.504
I’m eating!

38:16.546 --> 38:18.715
Oh, jeez.

38:23.053 --> 38:24.721
Coming, Dave.

38:24.763 --> 38:28.058
We’ve got braised confit pig’s
cheek with a sweet potato puree.

38:28.099 --> 38:29.392
Oh, my God.

38:29.434 --> 38:32.562
The Prunotto Barolo Italian
wine with the pork.

38:32.604 --> 38:34.522
-Ooh!
-This is amazing.

38:34.564 --> 38:35.565
There’s no way this can’t suck.

38:35.607 --> 38:36.691
Is it the best?

38:36.733 --> 38:37.817
Oh, my God.

38:37.859 --> 38:39.694
I’m so tired, oh.

38:39.736 --> 38:41.237
<i>Kyle, Kyle, Nat.</i>

38:41.279 --> 38:43.156
<i>Are you able to come to</i>
<i>the master for a minute?</i>

38:43.198 --> 38:46.534
Tash, I’m going to quick to help
Nat a tiny bit in the cabins.

38:46.576 --> 38:49.412
Thanks, Kyle.

38:49.454 --> 38:51.790
Babe, your food is unreal.

38:51.831 --> 38:53.375
Your drinks are unreal.

38:53.416 --> 38:54.542
Good team, eh?

38:54.584 --> 38:56.002
Yeah.

39:00.215 --> 39:03.802
I promise you, at this point
I’m gonna close you up in here.

39:06.012 --> 39:06.930
Yeah!

39:09.641 --> 39:10.809
You’ve been here for three days

39:10.850 --> 39:12.435
and your pussy
be throbbing already.

39:12.477 --> 39:14.312
Shut... Kyle!

39:14.354 --> 39:16.523
Noah, if you wake up
tomorrow without a hangover,

39:16.564 --> 39:18.400
I’m gonna be so upset.

39:18.441 --> 39:19.734
Oh... He’s 22!

39:19.776 --> 39:21.027
Here we go.

39:22.320 --> 39:24.239
-Are cabins done?
-Yeah.

39:24.280 --> 39:25.240
Do you wanna head down?

39:26.491 --> 39:27.951
Good night.

39:27.992 --> 39:30.203
Careful, guys, walking up,
because it’ll roll.

39:35.208 --> 39:37.252
I don’t know
what you said, honey.

39:37.293 --> 39:38.920
Oh, my God, you guys,
look at this.

39:38.962 --> 39:39.754
Oh sh--.

39:39.796 --> 39:41.506
Oh, yay, hello!

39:41.548 --> 39:42.507
Oh, Dave!

39:42.549 --> 39:43.508
How you doing?

39:43.550 --> 39:44.843
The finale!

39:44.884 --> 39:46.219
So, this is, like,
a chocolate ball,

39:46.261 --> 39:47.595
and inside the ball

39:47.637 --> 39:49.556
there’s a white chocolate
and ginger cheesecake.

39:49.597 --> 39:50.932
Ooh!

39:50.974 --> 39:52.767
So, just gonna pour some
hot sauce on the top.

39:52.809 --> 39:55.770
Yeah, do it... whoa.

39:55.812 --> 39:57.313
You’ve outdone yourself.

39:57.355 --> 39:58.815
You are a stud.

39:58.857 --> 40:00.275
This is actually
very impressive.

40:00.316 --> 40:01.609
Thank you very much.

40:01.651 --> 40:02.610
Yeah, majorly, yeah.

40:02.652 --> 40:03.611
-Thanks, guys.
-Wow.

40:03.653 --> 40:04.612
It is very impressive.

40:04.654 --> 40:06.656
Aw, good work, you.

40:08.491 --> 40:09.993
-Dinner’s done.
-Dinner is done.

40:10.035 --> 40:12.078
It’s 12:00, I’m gonna go to bed.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.788
-Good night.
-Good night, love.

40:13.830 --> 40:14.998
Good night.

40:18.001 --> 40:19.836
Back to work, mate.

40:19.878 --> 40:22.672
-Noah!
-Tommy!

40:22.714 --> 40:24.341
Yo!

40:24.382 --> 40:26.134
Not yet!

40:27.510 --> 40:29.637
Woo!

40:29.679 --> 40:31.264
This is where you
make the magic.

40:31.306 --> 40:32.849
Yeah!

40:32.891 --> 40:34.142
This is where
the magic gets done.

40:34.184 --> 40:35.393
-Yeah.
-Ah!

40:37.103 --> 40:37.896
Hey!

40:37.937 --> 40:38.897
What you looking for, babe?

40:38.938 --> 40:40.065
Noah’s down there.

40:40.106 --> 40:41.483
Get that ----er
up here right now.

40:41.524 --> 40:43.234
I will do, cheers.

40:45.028 --> 40:47.572
Ugh.

40:47.614 --> 40:50.116
-You off to bed, Dave?
-Yeah.

40:50.158 --> 40:51.493
Good night, you.

40:51.534 --> 40:52.702
All right.

41:05.173 --> 41:06.383
[alarm sounds]

41:13.431 --> 41:17.519
Please don’t touch
the washing machines.

41:17.560 --> 41:19.020
<i>Raygan, Raygan, Sandy.</i>

41:19.062 --> 41:20.522
Can you meet me in the bridge?

41:20.563 --> 41:22.315
<i>Yeah, copy.</i>

41:22.357 --> 41:23.566
Oh, God.

41:23.608 --> 41:24.818
A couple things.

41:24.859 --> 41:26.486
I wanna see you succeed on deck.

41:26.528 --> 41:27.904
-Yeah.
-You know what I mean?

41:27.946 --> 41:31.032
So, I think I need to know
what you need

41:31.074 --> 41:34.327
to help you get organized,
you know what I mean, like...

41:34.369 --> 41:35.537
Yeah.

41:35.578 --> 41:38.206
Because when you’re organized,

41:38.248 --> 41:40.709
that’s when you gain
the trust from your deck crew,

41:40.750 --> 41:42.043
you know what I mean?

41:42.085 --> 41:44.462
My suggestion to you is
that you go practice...

41:44.504 --> 41:45.755
Yeah.

41:45.797 --> 41:48.008
Practice, practice,
and put your toys

41:48.049 --> 41:49.426
where you can get them.

41:49.467 --> 41:51.052
I’m realizing where
I’m going wrong

41:51.094 --> 41:53.430
and where I should be
more as well, so yeah.

41:53.471 --> 41:58.351
But it’s not where you need to
be, it’s how you need to lead.

41:58.393 --> 42:00.729
You have to be very
clear and concise...

42:00.770 --> 42:03.106
-Yeah.
-...on your instructions.

42:03.148 --> 42:04.774
The last thing I wanna do
is tear your spirit down.

42:04.816 --> 42:06.067
-Mm-hmm.
-I wanna build it up.

42:06.109 --> 42:07.694
Mm-hmm.

42:07.736 --> 42:09.029
But at the same time, I’m here
to do a business, and I am...

42:09.070 --> 42:10.864
I’m really struggling.

42:10.905 --> 42:13.324
Like, no one’s being
told what to do.

42:18.246 --> 42:20.040
Well, I think...

42:20.081 --> 42:21.666
-I’m gonna be more...
-If you want my advice...

42:21.708 --> 42:23.043
Yeah.

42:23.084 --> 42:24.252
You need to figure out
your own weaknesses.

42:24.294 --> 42:25.962
Mm-hmm.

42:26.004 --> 42:27.922
That’s where you’re
struggling, not them.

42:27.964 --> 42:29.090
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

42:29.132 --> 42:30.425
I walked down that
swim platform,

42:30.467 --> 42:33.928
it was complete chaos
on that aft deck.

42:33.970 --> 42:39.309
Nothing... there’s no...
you have no system.

42:39.351 --> 42:40.560
-Yes, on other boats...
-Yeah.

42:40.602 --> 42:42.437
...you had these positions.

42:42.479 --> 42:44.564
But it wasn’t this busy,
and it wasn’t, like...

42:44.606 --> 42:45.857
It wasn’t...

42:45.899 --> 42:47.233
It wasn’t horrendous,
like this boat.

42:47.275 --> 42:48.526
Obviously, it’s a very,
very busy charter,

42:48.568 --> 42:49.819
and a lot of toys going on.

42:49.861 --> 42:51.279
But it’s professionally
managed, so...

42:52.864 --> 42:53.823
-No, no, no...
-If you want...

42:53.865 --> 42:55.116
if you want them to well...

42:55.158 --> 42:56.201
Super-yachts don’t
work like that.

42:56.242 --> 42:57.952
They don’t work differently.

42:57.994 --> 43:00.121
There’s a system
in place for safety,

43:00.163 --> 43:01.664
and that really upsets me.

43:01.706 --> 43:06.836
So, you have this time to
show me you can do this job.

43:09.756 --> 43:12.092
I need to be able to have
a bosun I can trust,

43:12.133 --> 43:15.845
and a bosun
that has guest priority.

43:15.887 --> 43:17.555
You know what I mean?

43:22.894 --> 43:24.479
Next, on "Below Deck Med"...

43:24.521 --> 43:25.605
Woo!

43:25.647 --> 43:27.857
Cannonball.

43:27.899 --> 43:29.943
[laughing]

43:33.446 --> 43:34.823
Do you want help?

43:34.864 --> 43:36.574
No, I’ve got it.

43:36.616 --> 43:38.535
She’s pretty much completely
different at this point.

43:38.576 --> 43:39.828
Why are you being weird?

43:39.869 --> 43:41.454
-How am I being weird?
-You are.

43:41.496 --> 43:44.541
It’s making me feel
absolutely worthless.

43:50.380 --> 43:52.632
-See that?
-That weather?

43:52.674 --> 43:54.009
-The weather.
-Yeah.

43:54.050 --> 43:55.719
Unfortunately, I need
to haul anchor

43:55.760 --> 43:58.054
and head back to that dock
before the wind hits.

43:58.096 --> 44:00.390
Three meters on starboard.

44:00.432 --> 44:01.850
One meter...
she’s gonna hit it, man.

44:01.891 --> 44:02.934
We’re gonna hit,
we’re gonna hit.

44:02.976 --> 44:04.269
Jesus Christ.

44:07.105 --> 44:08.106
This is the first
time in my career

44:08.148 --> 44:09.566
I’ve ever hit the dolphin.
