WEBVTT

00:15.041 --> 00:17.166
When is he going to get here?

00:17.208 --> 00:19.959
I don't know. I'm not in charge

00:17.208 --> 00:19.959
of when guys get here.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.333
[laughs]

00:21.375 --> 00:22.417
Well, did you

00:21.375 --> 00:22.417
make an appointment?

00:23.208 --> 00:24.208
Not exactly.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.083
Of course you didn't.

00:26.125 --> 00:27.709
Because you can't commit

00:26.125 --> 00:27.709
to anything.

00:27.750 --> 00:29.208
That's not true.

00:29.250 --> 00:31.083
I'm committed

00:29.250 --> 00:31.083
to finishing this banana.

00:31.125 --> 00:32.834
[laughs]

00:33.542 --> 00:34.208
- Hey ho..

00:34.667 --> 00:36.041
Here I am.

00:36.083 --> 00:39.166
Good. Please delete my

00:36.083 --> 00:39.166
thumbprint from Henry's locker.

00:39.208 --> 00:42.667
- Yeah. We're not going to be

00:39.208 --> 00:42.667
sharing a locker anymore.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.000
You want me

00:42.709 --> 00:44.000
to act surprised?

00:45.583 --> 00:46.500
Because I'm not.

00:46.542 --> 00:47.542
[laughs]

00:47.583 --> 00:48.583
Why are you not surprised?

00:48.625 --> 00:49.750
Let me guess.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.125
She wants you two

00:50.250 --> 00:52.125
to be boyfriend and girlfriend,

00:52.166 --> 00:54.458
but you're not ready,

00:52.166 --> 00:54.458
so she's moving out.

00:54.500 --> 00:55.667
Is that about it?

00:55.709 --> 00:57.709
- That's not exactly it.

00:55.709 --> 00:57.709
- That's exactly it.

00:57.750 --> 00:58.667
- I thought so.

01:00.250 --> 01:04.875
Look, Bianca, I'm almost

01:00.250 --> 01:04.875
finished with this banana I

01:00.250 --> 01:04.875
committed to eating.

01:04.917 --> 01:07.291
- Hey, Henry.

01:04.917 --> 01:07.291
You want a mango?

01:04.917 --> 01:07.291
- Yes.

01:07.333 --> 01:08.875
[laughs]

01:08.917 --> 01:11.083
Uh, you can't just bite

01:08.917 --> 01:11.083
into a mango.

01:11.125 --> 01:12.250
You have to peel it first.

01:13.208 --> 01:14.166
I...

01:15.583 --> 01:16.667
do what I want.

01:18.041 --> 01:19.959
[laughs]

01:23.208 --> 01:24.333
You want to spit it out

01:23.208 --> 01:24.333
into my pocket?

01:24.375 --> 01:25.125
God, yes.

01:25.166 --> 01:26.834
[laughs]

01:33.000 --> 01:35.041
And then Bianca said

01:33.000 --> 01:35.041
she didn't want to be

01:35.083 --> 01:37.667
my locker buddy anymore

01:35.083 --> 01:37.667
just because I said

01:37.709 --> 01:39.458
I wasn't sure I want

01:37.709 --> 01:39.458
to be boyfriend and girlfriend.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.458
Can you believe that?

01:40.500 --> 01:41.333
- Yes.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.333
- I know.

01:41.375 --> 01:42.250
Wait, wait, yes?

01:42.291 --> 01:43.583
[laughs]

01:43.625 --> 01:45.125
Yeah.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.125
I'm on Bianca's side here.

01:45.792 --> 01:46.709
No.

01:47.083 --> 01:48.834
No, that's the wrong side

01:47.083 --> 01:48.834
for you to be on.

01:48.875 --> 01:49.959
[laughs]

01:55.083 --> 01:56.000
[laughs]

01:59.709 --> 02:01.125
What's on your head?

02:01.166 --> 02:03.709
A glass hat.

02:01.166 --> 02:03.709
I just got it.

02:03.750 --> 02:05.208
Oh, I've heard

02:03.750 --> 02:05.208
of those.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.125
What is a glass hat?

02:07.917 --> 02:08.583
It's a hat...

02:09.583 --> 02:10.583
made of glass.

02:10.625 --> 02:11.709
[laughs]

02:12.083 --> 02:13.625
A lot of celebrities

02:12.083 --> 02:13.625
are wearing them.

02:14.375 --> 02:15.667
Okay. Well, congrats

02:14.375 --> 02:15.667
on your glass hat,

02:15.709 --> 02:16.792
but Charlotte and I are having--

02:16.834 --> 02:17.542
Guess what?

02:17.583 --> 02:19.083
- What?

02:17.583 --> 02:19.083
- Don't care.

02:19.125 --> 02:21.542
[laughs]

02:22.417 --> 02:23.000
[sighs]

02:26.041 --> 02:27.542
Okay, I can't believe

02:26.041 --> 02:27.542
you're taking Bianca's side.

02:29.208 --> 02:31.291
Henry, you don't share

02:29.208 --> 02:31.291
a locker with a girl

02:31.333 --> 02:32.750
unless you're really

02:31.333 --> 02:32.750
into that girl.

02:33.250 --> 02:34.542
I was into Bianca.

02:35.083 --> 02:38.125
But you wanted to leave

02:35.083 --> 02:38.125
your options open for...

02:38.875 --> 02:39.500
I...

02:40.166 --> 02:41.959
I don't know

02:40.166 --> 02:41.959
what you're talking about.

02:42.000 --> 02:42.750
[laughs]

02:42.792 --> 02:43.625
I'm talking...

02:45.125 --> 02:47.792
I'm talking about your

02:45.125 --> 02:47.792
Wall Dog friend, Veronika.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.417
Your pretty little graffiti girl

02:47.834 --> 02:50.417
who you like to kiss.

02:51.041 --> 02:52.208
That...

02:52.250 --> 02:54.083
that was undercover kissing.

02:54.125 --> 02:55.000
What?

02:58.667 --> 03:00.208
I was being Kid Danger

03:00.250 --> 03:02.667
and my job was to get

03:00.250 --> 03:02.667
information from her.

03:03.166 --> 03:04.959
And what information

03:03.166 --> 03:04.959
were you trying to find out?

03:05.000 --> 03:05.792
What her mouth tastes like?

03:05.834 --> 03:07.125
[laughs]

03:07.166 --> 03:08.875
Aah!

03:07.166 --> 03:08.875
There's a smudge on my hat.

03:10.041 --> 03:11.542
Hey, where's the glass cleaner?

03:11.875 --> 03:13.417
Ah, check the garage.

03:14.542 --> 03:15.333
[Piper sighs]

03:17.083 --> 03:19.834
Okay, this whole thing

03:17.083 --> 03:19.834
is about Bianca, not Veronika.

03:19.875 --> 03:22.834
Uh-huh. And when was

03:19.875 --> 03:22.834
the last time you saw Veronika?

03:22.875 --> 03:24.166
I don't know.

03:24.917 --> 03:26.083
Maybe last week, once...

03:27.500 --> 03:28.417
or three times.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.417
I don't remember.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.375
[laughs]

03:30.417 --> 03:31.041
[Jasper]

03:30.417 --> 03:31.041
Hey, Charlotte.

03:32.125 --> 03:32.834
Henry,

03:33.750 --> 03:36.000
I've been thinking

03:33.750 --> 03:36.000
about your mom's chili all day.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.625
[laughs]

03:37.667 --> 03:38.917
Okay.

03:38.959 --> 03:40.333
Is there any left?

03:38.959 --> 03:40.333
Can I have some?

03:41.083 --> 03:42.291
Yeah, there's some left

03:41.083 --> 03:42.291
in the fridge.

03:42.333 --> 03:45.625
Awesome.

03:42.333 --> 03:45.625
Chili, chili, chili, chili.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.208
You know, I don't think

03:48.500 --> 03:50.208
you're being very fair here.

03:50.834 --> 03:51.750
[Charlotte]

03:50.834 --> 03:51.750
Henry, I know you.

03:52.125 --> 03:53.667
You want both girls.

03:53.709 --> 03:55.417
You want to have your cake

03:53.709 --> 03:55.417
and kiss it, too.

03:56.125 --> 03:58.000
No, I just want...

03:59.625 --> 04:01.375
I just want my freedom

03:59.625 --> 04:01.375
because this is America.

04:01.417 --> 04:02.250
Oh my God.

04:02.291 --> 04:03.333
[Henry]

04:02.291 --> 04:03.333
What?

04:03.375 --> 04:04.333
[Charlotte]

04:03.375 --> 04:04.333
Come on.

04:04.375 --> 04:06.125
[Henry]

04:04.375 --> 04:06.125
It's true.

04:06.166 --> 04:08.583
And I have the right to go out

04:06.166 --> 04:08.583
with more than one girl.

04:08.625 --> 04:10.000
I think it's even

04:08.625 --> 04:10.000
in the Constitution,

04:10.750 --> 04:11.583
or the Torah, or something.

04:11.625 --> 04:12.667
[laughs]

04:13.959 --> 04:15.875
[Charlotte]

04:13.959 --> 04:15.875
Okay, then. Fine.

04:15.917 --> 04:17.291
You want your freedom

04:15.917 --> 04:17.291
from Bianca,

04:17.333 --> 04:18.834
so now she gets

04:17.333 --> 04:18.834
her freedom from you.

04:19.875 --> 04:20.875
[Henry]

04:19.875 --> 04:20.875
You know what? You're right.

04:21.583 --> 04:23.166
It's good Bianca and I broke up.

04:23.208 --> 04:25.500
Because that way

04:23.208 --> 04:25.500
I get my options,

04:25.542 --> 04:27.250
she gets her options,

04:27.291 --> 04:30.875
and now I have more room

04:27.291 --> 04:30.875
in my locker for sports balls.

04:30.917 --> 04:32.625
[laughs]

04:36.667 --> 04:37.667
Where's my glass hat?

04:38.667 --> 04:39.625
Your glass hat?

04:40.458 --> 04:42.166
Yeah. I left it right here.

04:42.959 --> 04:43.917
Did you see it?

04:43.959 --> 04:45.375
I saw a bowl.

04:46.250 --> 04:47.375
[Piper]

04:46.250 --> 04:47.375
A bowl.

04:48.834 --> 04:51.250
Did you use my glass hat

04:48.834 --> 04:51.250
as a bowl?

04:51.917 --> 04:52.959
Uh...

04:53.000 --> 04:53.959
Where is it?

04:54.291 --> 04:55.667
It's in the microwave.

04:55.709 --> 04:56.709
What?

04:56.750 --> 04:58.709
It's not microwave safe.

04:58.750 --> 05:00.250
Well, how was

04:58.750 --> 05:00.250
I supposed to know?

05:00.291 --> 05:01.291
[explosion]

05:01.333 --> 05:03.291
[grunting]

05:13.125 --> 05:15.417
[laughs]

05:16.500 --> 05:17.875
I'm sorry I broke your hat.

05:17.917 --> 05:20.709
[laughs]

05:21.333 --> 05:22.750
It all just kind of happened.

05:22.792 --> 05:25.166
My dad was

05:22.792 --> 05:25.166
an irresponsible scientist.

05:25.208 --> 05:26.625
I wanted an after-school job.

05:27.125 --> 05:29.542
[Captain Man]

05:27.125 --> 05:29.542
And by accident,

05:27.125 --> 05:29.542
he made me indestructible.

05:29.583 --> 05:30.917
Ah!

05:30.959 --> 05:32.709
[Henry]

05:30.959 --> 05:32.709
I went into this crazy store

05:33.375 --> 05:35.625
and met

05:33.375 --> 05:35.625
a pretty interesting guy.

05:35.667 --> 05:39.333
I'm going to blow your mind.

05:35.667 --> 05:39.333
[Captain Man]

05:35.667 --> 05:39.333
Now I protect

05:35.667 --> 05:39.333
the good citizens of Swellview

05:39.375 --> 05:42.166
who call me...

05:39.375 --> 05:42.166
[Henry]

05:39.375 --> 05:42.166
And he turned out to be...

05:39.375 --> 05:42.166
- You know the name.

05:42.208 --> 05:45.041
- Captain Man!

05:42.208 --> 05:45.041
- That's right, Henry.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.375
In time, I realized

05:45.083 --> 05:47.375
that being a superhero

05:47.417 --> 05:48.875
is a lot to handle alone.

05:48.917 --> 05:50.250
He wanted some help.

05:50.291 --> 05:51.166
[Captain Man]

05:50.291 --> 05:51.166
I needed a sidekick.

05:52.458 --> 05:55.041
[Henry] I, Henry Hart...

05:52.458 --> 05:55.041
[Captain Man]

05:52.458 --> 05:55.041
Pledge to never ever ever...

05:52.458 --> 05:55.041
tell anyone...

05:55.083 --> 05:56.000
That I'm Captain Man's

05:55.083 --> 05:56.000
secret sidekick.

05:56.333 --> 05:57.458
It is done.

05:57.500 --> 05:58.667
[Henry]

05:57.500 --> 05:58.667
Now we blow bubbles.

05:58.709 --> 05:59.667
[Captain Man]

05:58.709 --> 05:59.667
And fight crime.

05:59.709 --> 06:01.041
[Henry]

05:59.709 --> 06:01.041
Feels good.

06:01.083 --> 06:05.750
♪♪♪

06:15.208 --> 06:16.208
Call it.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.250
Up the tube!

06:18.291 --> 06:20.083
Oh, my boot.

06:20.125 --> 06:20.709
[Captain Man]

06:20.125 --> 06:20.709
Ha!

06:28.208 --> 06:28.750
Aah!

06:28.792 --> 06:29.667
[laughs]

06:29.709 --> 06:30.709
Hi.

06:31.709 --> 06:32.709
Where'd you come from?

06:33.667 --> 06:36.750
Doesn't matter.

06:33.667 --> 06:36.750
Because you look cute.

06:38.458 --> 06:39.417
I was going for cute.

06:39.458 --> 06:41.166
[laughs]

06:41.208 --> 06:43.041
So, why don't we take a walk

06:43.083 --> 06:45.000
by Swellview Pond

06:43.083 --> 06:45.000
and then we can--

06:45.041 --> 06:45.750
- Wh--

06:46.333 --> 06:47.625
Are those cans

06:46.333 --> 06:47.625
of spray paint?

06:48.166 --> 06:49.208
Yeah, so?

06:49.834 --> 06:51.291
You promised me.

06:49.834 --> 06:51.291
No more graffiti.

06:51.875 --> 06:52.709
Uh-huh.

06:53.333 --> 06:54.625
You know,

06:53.333 --> 06:54.625
I could've taken you to jail

06:54.667 --> 06:55.750
with the rest of the Wall Dogs.

06:55.792 --> 06:56.917
I know.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.709
But I let you go

06:56.959 --> 06:58.709
on the condition

06:58.750 --> 07:00.500
that you'd stop

06:58.750 --> 07:00.500
spraying graffiti

07:00.542 --> 07:03.417
all over Swellview and...

07:00.542 --> 07:03.417
and that feels really good.

07:03.458 --> 07:05.000
[laughs]

07:05.750 --> 07:07.208
Yeah.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.208
We should probably kiss.

07:08.166 --> 07:10.709
Well, then it's a good thing

07:08.166 --> 07:10.709
I brought my lips.

07:10.750 --> 07:12.333
[laughs]

07:12.375 --> 07:13.166
[Man]

07:12.375 --> 07:13.166
Hey!

07:13.667 --> 07:14.750
You kids!

07:16.125 --> 07:17.458
Were you two about to kiss?

07:18.542 --> 07:19.792
Yeah, pretty much.

07:18.542 --> 07:19.792
I don't know. Maybe.

07:19.834 --> 07:20.458
Well, stop it!

07:21.667 --> 07:23.083
This is a park,

07:23.125 --> 07:25.291
not some kissatorium!

07:25.333 --> 07:26.417
[laughs]

07:26.458 --> 07:27.333
Sir...

07:28.542 --> 07:32.041
this park is for all citizens

07:28.542 --> 07:32.041
of Swellview to use and enjoy

07:32.083 --> 07:35.375
and if this young lady

07:32.083 --> 07:35.375
and I want to kiss,

07:35.417 --> 07:36.834
then we have every right to--

07:36.875 --> 07:38.792
[laughs]

07:41.000 --> 07:42.208
Let's go somewhere else.

07:42.250 --> 07:43.542
[laughs]

07:43.583 --> 07:44.458
That's right!

07:44.500 --> 07:45.500
Just cross off!

07:50.166 --> 07:52.083
And sadly,

07:50.166 --> 07:52.083
according to city officials,

07:52.125 --> 07:54.375
there were no survivors.

07:54.709 --> 07:55.792
Got to be more careful.

07:55.834 --> 07:57.917
[laughs]

07:57.959 --> 07:58.959
In other news...

07:59.917 --> 08:02.959
yesterday, Swellview's own

07:59.917 --> 08:02.959
Captain Man was attacked again

08:03.000 --> 08:06.291
by the elderly woman who's come

08:03.000 --> 08:06.291
to be known as "The Mad Granny."

08:06.917 --> 08:09.041
It happened at a junior

08:06.917 --> 08:09.041
high school yesterday

08:09.083 --> 08:11.166
as Captain Man

08:09.083 --> 08:11.166
was speaking to kids

08:11.208 --> 08:13.542
about the importance

08:11.208 --> 08:13.542
of climate change.

08:14.583 --> 08:17.333
You see, climate

08:14.583 --> 08:17.333
is like our weather.

08:18.917 --> 08:20.458
And when it comes to weather,

08:20.500 --> 08:22.041
the last thing

08:20.500 --> 08:22.041
you want is change.

08:22.083 --> 08:23.750
Because change is bad.

08:25.041 --> 08:27.041
Now, sometimes change

08:25.041 --> 08:27.041
can be good

08:27.834 --> 08:29.333
like changing your underwear.

08:30.250 --> 08:31.083
That helps everyone.

08:32.208 --> 08:34.291
But with climate,

08:32.208 --> 08:34.291
change is our enemy.

08:34.333 --> 08:36.959
Ow! What the--

08:37.000 --> 08:38.875
Aah! Aah!

08:40.500 --> 08:42.291
[laughing]

08:44.959 --> 08:46.709
Anyway, speaking of

08:44.959 --> 08:46.709
Captain Man,

08:46.750 --> 08:48.709
he'll be on hand tomorrow

08:46.750 --> 08:48.709
in Swellview Park,

08:48.750 --> 08:51.041
where the Vice Mayor will be

08:48.750 --> 08:51.041
hosting the official dedication

08:51.083 --> 08:53.792
of Swellview's

08:51.083 --> 08:53.792
first public bathroom

08:53.834 --> 08:56.417
that was built

08:53.834 --> 08:56.417
way back in 1898.

08:57.083 --> 08:58.792
Mary, you know

08:57.083 --> 08:58.792
that bathroom.

08:57.083 --> 08:58.792
I do.

08:59.208 --> 09:01.041
So many memories.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.625
[laughs]

09:14.792 --> 09:16.250
Stop being so paranoid.

09:16.291 --> 09:17.834
Oh, easy for you to say.

09:17.875 --> 09:19.208
You don't have a crazy old lady

09:17.875 --> 09:19.208
running around,

09:19.250 --> 09:20.500
whacking you with an umbrella.

09:20.542 --> 09:21.750
[laughs]

09:21.792 --> 09:22.583
Relax.

09:22.917 --> 09:23.583
I'm here.

09:24.917 --> 09:26.000
I'm watching

09:24.917 --> 09:26.000
everything like a hawk.

09:30.375 --> 09:31.458
[laughs]

09:36.625 --> 09:37.500
Stop that!

09:38.375 --> 09:40.083
Now, go.

09:38.375 --> 09:40.083
Survey the park.

09:40.125 --> 09:41.375
Make sure the Mad Granny's

09:40.125 --> 09:41.375
not here.

09:41.417 --> 09:42.000
Okay.

09:44.041 --> 09:47.542
Yeah, I'll take some popcorn

09:44.041 --> 09:47.542
in a souvenir toilet.

09:47.959 --> 09:50.208
[laughs]

10:02.417 --> 10:03.083
[Kid Danger]

10:02.417 --> 10:03.083
Bianca?

10:10.750 --> 10:12.208
She's feeding him popcorn.

10:18.667 --> 10:19.625
Uh-huh.

10:18.667 --> 10:19.625
It was funny.

10:20.417 --> 10:21.542
Uh, pardon me.

10:21.959 --> 10:22.917
Ohy are you interrupting--

10:21.959 --> 10:22.917
Ooh.

10:24.959 --> 10:25.625
[Vice Major]

10:24.959 --> 10:25.625
All right.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.458
All right.

10:27.834 --> 10:29.083
Thank you for being here

10:29.125 --> 10:31.083
to witness

10:29.125 --> 10:31.083
this official dedication

10:31.125 --> 10:35.750
of our city's very first public

10:31.125 --> 10:35.750
restroom built way back in 1898.

10:35.792 --> 10:39.291
[cheers and applause]

10:39.333 --> 10:43.500
And now I give you

10:39.333 --> 10:43.500
our very own Captain Man.

10:43.875 --> 10:47.500
[cheers and applause]

10:51.417 --> 10:52.500
Oh God, the Mad Granny!

10:53.667 --> 10:54.458
Eat this, lady!

10:55.208 --> 10:59.291
[screaming]

11:03.834 --> 11:06.583
This isn't the Mad Granny.

11:03.834 --> 11:06.583
It's my mother.

11:06.625 --> 11:07.667
[laughs]

11:07.709 --> 11:10.583
Oh. Well, then...

11:10.625 --> 11:11.750
No need to apologize.

11:11.792 --> 11:14.834
[laughs]

11:15.208 --> 11:16.125
Look.

11:17.583 --> 11:19.709
Bianca's over there

11:17.583 --> 11:19.709
feeding popcorn to some guy.

11:20.041 --> 11:21.417
Oh, you mean Blake?

11:21.709 --> 11:23.291
I don't know.

11:23.333 --> 11:26.000
He's some dude

11:23.333 --> 11:26.000
in a red shirt with--

11:23.333 --> 11:26.000
Who the heck is Blake?

11:26.041 --> 11:27.250
He moved to Swellview

11:26.041 --> 11:27.250
about two weeks ago.

11:27.291 --> 11:28.083
Super nice guy.

11:28.625 --> 11:30.709
Who cares if he's nice?

11:30.750 --> 11:32.250
[laughs]

11:32.291 --> 11:33.917
She can't be with him.

11:35.250 --> 11:38.792
Why not? You said you wanted

11:35.250 --> 11:38.792
your freedom.

11:38.834 --> 11:39.667
I don't remember saying that.

11:40.750 --> 11:43.083
You said,

11:40.750 --> 11:43.083
"This is America.

11:43.125 --> 11:44.834
"I want freedom.

11:44.875 --> 11:47.875
And I have the right to go

11:44.875 --> 11:47.875
with any girl I want."

11:48.875 --> 11:50.166
Well, yeah.

11:50.208 --> 11:52.709
But that applies to me,

11:50.208 --> 11:52.709
not Bianca.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.375
Oh, so you get your freedom,

11:55.417 --> 11:58.000
but Bianca should just sit

11:55.417 --> 11:58.000
at home alone doing nothing.

11:58.041 --> 11:59.500
Thank you.

11:59.542 --> 12:00.375
[laughs]

12:04.041 --> 12:05.583
Can I go ahead

12:04.041 --> 12:05.583
and get started?

12:06.250 --> 12:07.834
Yeah, sure.

12:10.375 --> 12:11.750
Thank you.

12:11.792 --> 12:12.542
[clears throat]

12:13.625 --> 12:15.291
Bathrooms go by many names.

12:16.417 --> 12:17.834
Such as, the restroom.

12:18.834 --> 12:20.500
The John.

12:20.542 --> 12:21.166
The head.

12:22.458 --> 12:24.792
The potty. The loo.

12:22.458 --> 12:24.792
The toidy.

12:25.625 --> 12:27.250
Tinkle Town.

12:28.000 --> 12:28.709
Poo corner.

12:28.750 --> 12:30.417
[laughs]

12:30.458 --> 12:31.208
The lavatory.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.792
Hey, Piper. Piper.

12:32.834 --> 12:34.417
You know where

12:32.834 --> 12:34.417
there's a bathroom?

12:34.458 --> 12:36.750
Don't talk to me.

12:34.458 --> 12:36.750
You broke my glass hat.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.542
I said I was sorry.

12:38.583 --> 12:39.917
Now, come on.

12:38.583 --> 12:39.917
I really need a bathroom.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.834
There's one over there.

12:42.166 --> 12:43.500
That's the one

12:42.166 --> 12:43.500
they're dedicating.

12:43.542 --> 12:45.375
They won't let anyone

12:43.542 --> 12:45.375
go in there.

12:45.417 --> 12:47.542
Okay, just go around the back

12:45.417 --> 12:47.542
and use the girls' bathroom.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.417
But that's for girls.

12:49.458 --> 12:51.333
I'll get in trouble

12:49.458 --> 12:51.333
if I go in there.

12:51.375 --> 12:52.166
No.

12:53.125 --> 12:54.542
I'll come stand guard

12:54.583 --> 12:56.291
and let you know

12:54.583 --> 12:56.291
if someone's coming.

12:56.333 --> 12:58.542
Okay. Thanks. Come on.

13:00.041 --> 13:03.333
[Captain Man]

13:00.041 --> 13:03.333
It was 30 years ago, my dad had

13:00.041 --> 13:03.333
taken me fishing.

13:03.375 --> 13:04.625
Oh, man.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.250
What?

13:06.291 --> 13:08.041
The guy Blarf just whispered

13:06.291 --> 13:08.041
something in Bianca's ear

13:08.083 --> 13:09.083
and she laughed.

13:09.125 --> 13:10.291
[laughs]

13:10.333 --> 13:11.291
His name is Blake.

13:11.333 --> 13:11.959
I pronounce it "Blarf."

13:12.000 --> 13:14.333
[laughs]

13:20.583 --> 13:21.333
[grunting]

13:27.500 --> 13:28.792
[Captain Man]

13:27.500 --> 13:28.792
That's when my dad told me

13:28.834 --> 13:31.166
about Swellview's oldest

13:28.834 --> 13:31.166
public restroom.

13:31.208 --> 13:32.959
[laughs]

13:34.083 --> 13:35.500
This bathroom was a--

13:35.542 --> 13:38.166
Ah, great.

13:35.542 --> 13:38.166
Now their elbows are touching.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.000
What do they think this is,

13:38.208 --> 13:40.000
their honeymoon?

13:40.041 --> 13:41.500
[laughs]

13:41.542 --> 13:42.834
Uh, Kid Danger,

13:43.625 --> 13:44.917
isn't that the Mad Granny?

13:46.083 --> 13:47.500
We must all be thankful.

13:49.375 --> 13:51.041
Uh-oh.

13:51.083 --> 13:52.709
And in the words of the great

13:51.083 --> 13:52.709
Sammy Davis Junior--

13:53.208 --> 13:55.917
[screaming]

13:59.417 --> 14:00.000
Come on.

14:00.792 --> 14:01.750
Ugh.

14:04.500 --> 14:05.333
He's in there.

14:05.792 --> 14:07.333
I told him

14:05.792 --> 14:07.333
it was for ladies only,

14:07.375 --> 14:08.709
but he went in anyway.

14:10.375 --> 14:12.291
And I think he has a knife.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.250
[laughs]

14:17.041 --> 14:18.959
[screams]

14:20.667 --> 14:22.333
That's for my glass hat.

14:22.375 --> 14:23.875
[laughs]

14:23.917 --> 14:26.125
[grunting]

14:26.166 --> 14:29.250
I'm okay. I'm okay.

14:31.250 --> 14:32.750
Hey. Don't worry.

14:31.250 --> 14:32.750
I'm here.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.000
Thanks.

14:37.959 --> 14:39.250
[laughs]

14:39.667 --> 14:41.417
I had to go.

14:41.458 --> 14:43.041
Nobody else was

14:41.458 --> 14:43.041
even in there.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.667
And I had my eyes closed.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.000
Piper!

14:44.709 --> 14:46.000
Piper, where are you?

14:47.333 --> 14:48.250
Piper!

14:48.667 --> 14:49.959
Piper!

14:50.000 --> 14:51.083
I don't even want to know.

14:51.125 --> 14:53.542
[laughs]

15:06.041 --> 15:08.041
[Captain Man]

15:06.041 --> 15:08.041
We must all be thankful.

15:08.083 --> 15:10.291
And in the words

15:08.083 --> 15:10.291
of the great Sammy

15:10.333 --> 15:13.959
[slow motion]

15:10.333 --> 15:13.959
Davis Junior, about--

15:10.333 --> 15:13.959
Oh!

15:19.625 --> 15:23.000
See, what we learned there is

15:19.625 --> 15:23.000
that when an old lady

15:23.041 --> 15:24.125
wants to beat me

15:25.041 --> 15:27.333
and you're not paying attention,

15:28.291 --> 15:29.500
what happens to old Ray?

15:30.542 --> 15:31.500
You get beaten.

15:31.542 --> 15:32.834
I'm sorry,

15:31.542 --> 15:32.834
what was that?

15:32.875 --> 15:33.834
- You get beaten.

15:32.875 --> 15:33.834
- I get beaten. Yeah.

15:37.333 --> 15:38.709
[slow motion grunting]

15:38.750 --> 15:40.375
And the beat goes on.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.041
[laughs]

15:46.083 --> 15:47.166
You know, Henry,

15:47.917 --> 15:49.333
when I picked you

15:47.917 --> 15:49.333
as my sidekick,

15:50.375 --> 15:52.291
it was because I thought

15:50.375 --> 15:52.291
I could always count on you

15:52.333 --> 15:53.500
to be by my side.

15:54.375 --> 15:55.500
I mean, it's in the name,

15:56.250 --> 15:57.166
"sidekick."

15:57.208 --> 15:58.166
[laughs]

15:58.500 --> 15:59.500
Why'd you let me down?

16:00.166 --> 16:01.542
Because I...

16:02.917 --> 16:03.834
I saw Bianca there.

16:04.625 --> 16:06.166
Bianca?

16:06.208 --> 16:08.166
What, that girl you used to go

16:06.208 --> 16:08.166
out with who was there yesterday

16:08.208 --> 16:09.375
with that super

16:08.208 --> 16:09.375
handsome new guy?

16:09.417 --> 16:10.667
He's not super handsome.

16:10.709 --> 16:11.542
I was told

16:10.709 --> 16:11.542
he's super handsome.

16:11.583 --> 16:12.458
Who told you that?

16:14.583 --> 16:16.542
[laughs]

16:18.917 --> 16:19.875
Wait.

16:20.583 --> 16:22.333
I thought Bianca got cast

16:20.583 --> 16:22.333
on that reality show,

16:22.375 --> 16:23.291
"Kids in the Woods."

16:23.333 --> 16:24.875
No, no, that was Chloe.

16:24.917 --> 16:27.041
Another girl Henry

16:24.917 --> 16:27.041
used to like.

16:27.083 --> 16:29.750
Hey, you can't blame me

16:27.083 --> 16:29.750
for the Chloe thing.

16:29.792 --> 16:31.333
She's the one

16:29.792 --> 16:31.333
who left me for the woods.

16:31.375 --> 16:32.792
[laughs]

16:33.250 --> 16:35.125
Fine, but you're the one who

16:33.250 --> 16:35.125
messed things up with Bianca.

16:35.667 --> 16:37.250
I'm over Bianca.

16:37.291 --> 16:38.834
Then why do you care

16:37.291 --> 16:38.834
if she's with another guy?

16:38.875 --> 16:41.250
Because I love her. What?

16:38.875 --> 16:41.250
Oh, life is hard.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.250
[laughs]

16:43.291 --> 16:45.125
You know what?

16:45.166 --> 16:47.291
I don't care what girl or girls

16:45.166 --> 16:47.291
you want to hang out with.

16:48.458 --> 16:49.917
I mean, look, nobody knows

16:49.959 --> 16:51.417
the joy of many girls

16:49.959 --> 16:51.417
better than I do.

16:51.458 --> 16:53.583
[laughs]

16:53.625 --> 16:56.500
But when you're Kid Danger,

16:53.625 --> 16:56.500
you have a responsibility.

16:57.333 --> 16:58.542
Don't let me down again.

17:05.083 --> 17:06.000
[sighs]

17:07.375 --> 17:08.166
All right.

17:08.542 --> 17:10.375
I know what I'm going to do.

17:10.417 --> 17:11.333
What?

17:11.375 --> 17:12.417
I'm going to find Bianca

17:12.458 --> 17:14.166
and I'm going to tell

17:12.458 --> 17:14.166
her that I lo--

17:14.208 --> 17:15.000
That I like her.

17:15.041 --> 17:16.083
Good, do it.

17:16.125 --> 17:17.250
I'm going to.

17:17.291 --> 17:18.625
Right after you tell that

17:17.291 --> 17:18.625
Wall Dog girl

17:18.667 --> 17:20.166
you're not going

17:18.667 --> 17:20.166
to see her anymore.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.250
Mm.

17:24.125 --> 17:25.709
What?

17:25.750 --> 17:27.583
I can't tell Veronika

17:25.750 --> 17:27.583
I don't want to see her anymore.

17:28.625 --> 17:29.583
Why can't you?

17:31.500 --> 17:32.792
Because if I do,

17:32.834 --> 17:34.834
then she'll try to kiss me

17:34.875 --> 17:36.333
and that's when

17:34.875 --> 17:36.333
my brain goes dumb.

17:36.375 --> 17:37.750
[laughs]

17:37.792 --> 17:39.375
All right.

17:39.417 --> 17:40.250
Give me your wrist.

17:41.667 --> 17:42.583
Why are you holding my--

17:42.625 --> 17:43.834
Ow!

17:45.583 --> 17:47.417
You slapped me with my own hand.

17:47.959 --> 17:50.041
Yeah, now, man up.

17:50.083 --> 17:51.834
Go tell Veronika

17:50.083 --> 17:51.834
you're done with her

17:51.875 --> 17:53.875
so you can get Bianca back

17:51.875 --> 17:53.875
before it's too late.

17:55.083 --> 17:56.000
Okay.

17:57.417 --> 17:58.208
Or maybe I could just--

17:58.250 --> 17:59.834
Ow!

18:00.792 --> 18:01.750
All right.

18:01.792 --> 18:03.709
[laughs]

18:09.041 --> 18:12.250
And see, there's this

18:09.041 --> 18:12.250
other girl that I really like

18:12.291 --> 18:14.458
and she really likes me and...

18:16.041 --> 18:17.667
You know, I feel like

18:16.041 --> 18:17.667
you're not listening.

18:17.709 --> 18:19.041
And done.

18:19.792 --> 18:20.417
What's done?

18:22.417 --> 18:23.834
[laughs]

18:24.375 --> 18:27.417
It's you and me together

18:24.375 --> 18:27.417
on a boat.

18:27.458 --> 18:28.250
But Veronika...

18:28.625 --> 18:29.834
You don't like the boat?

18:29.875 --> 18:30.875
I don't care about the boat.

18:30.917 --> 18:31.959
I can make it a truck.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.083
It's not about the vehicle.

18:33.125 --> 18:34.417
[laughs]

18:34.458 --> 18:36.625
I'm saying I can't come

18:34.458 --> 18:36.625
meet you anymore

18:36.667 --> 18:38.583
because I like someone else.

18:39.375 --> 18:40.333
Oh yeah?

18:41.583 --> 18:42.709
Is she prettier than me?

18:43.750 --> 18:45.291
I don't know.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.083
I mean, that's like asking,

18:45.333 --> 18:47.083
what's prettier,

18:47.125 --> 18:47.792
pizza or ice cream?

18:48.834 --> 18:51.291
Because pizza's pretty.

18:51.333 --> 18:54.834
But ice cream

18:51.333 --> 18:54.834
is also attractive.

18:56.166 --> 18:56.834
Hold it right there!

18:56.875 --> 18:57.500
[whistle]

18:59.041 --> 19:00.417
Let go of me.

19:00.458 --> 19:02.333
What are you doing?

19:00.458 --> 19:02.333
Stop it. Let go.

19:03.333 --> 19:04.458
How did you know

19:03.333 --> 19:04.458
she was the Mad Granny?

19:05.000 --> 19:07.125
We were just--

19:05.000 --> 19:07.125
What?

19:07.166 --> 19:08.583
She's the Mad Granny.

19:10.875 --> 19:11.542
Right.

19:12.375 --> 19:13.667
I know that.

19:13.709 --> 19:16.834
But how'd you know like I did?

19:18.083 --> 19:19.583
We got her DNA

19:18.083 --> 19:19.583
off the umbrella

19:19.625 --> 19:21.500
she dropped

19:19.625 --> 19:21.500
at the bathroom ceremony

19:21.542 --> 19:22.750
and then we tracked her here.

19:23.291 --> 19:24.041
How'd you find her?

19:25.083 --> 19:25.792
You know...

19:27.041 --> 19:28.125
the usual ways.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.583
Hey!

19:28.959 --> 19:30.583
Leave my backpack alone!

19:30.625 --> 19:31.166
No!

19:31.208 --> 19:32.250
[laughs]

19:33.500 --> 19:34.500
Looks like we got

19:33.500 --> 19:34.500
a granny wig.

19:34.542 --> 19:35.333
Ugh.

19:35.917 --> 19:36.583
A granny dress.

19:36.625 --> 19:37.583
Ugh.

19:39.041 --> 19:40.000
And granny panties.

19:40.041 --> 19:41.625
Ugh.

19:41.667 --> 19:43.250
[laughs]

19:43.291 --> 19:44.834
What have you got

19:43.291 --> 19:44.834
against Captain Man?

19:44.875 --> 19:47.000
Yeah, why've you been

19:44.875 --> 19:47.000
dressing up like an old lady

19:47.041 --> 19:48.000
and whacking him

19:47.041 --> 19:48.000
with an umbrella?

19:48.583 --> 19:49.375
For revenge.

19:49.959 --> 19:51.250
Because it's Captain Man's fault

19:51.291 --> 19:52.458
all the other Wall Dogs

19:51.291 --> 19:52.458
are in jail.

19:53.542 --> 19:54.583
Well, now that's

19:53.542 --> 19:54.583
where you're going.

19:54.625 --> 19:55.291
To jail.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.458
To jail.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.458
Let's take her

19:56.000 --> 19:57.458
out of here.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.291
Yeah, I get it.

19:58.709 --> 20:00.625
[laughs]

20:04.000 --> 20:04.709
So...

20:05.583 --> 20:06.417
You and me?

20:07.917 --> 20:08.875
We're over.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.417
[laughs]

20:14.500 --> 20:17.208
[laughs]

20:21.333 --> 20:22.417
Hey, are there

20:21.333 --> 20:22.417
any more candles?

20:22.959 --> 20:25.583
- Yeah, I got two more.

20:22.959 --> 20:25.583
- Cool, put them

20:22.959 --> 20:25.583
on the coffee table.

20:25.625 --> 20:30.792
- Okay. You go get the flowers

20:25.625 --> 20:30.792
from the counter.

20:25.625 --> 20:30.792
- Where do I put the flowers?

20:25.625 --> 20:30.792
- Just put them anywhere.

20:30.834 --> 20:31.500
Hey, guys.

20:31.917 --> 20:32.917
Jasper?

20:32.959 --> 20:34.750
What are you doing here?

20:34.792 --> 20:37.333
We thought you were

20:34.792 --> 20:37.333
locked up in juvy for wazzing in

20:34.792 --> 20:37.333
the ladies' room.

20:37.375 --> 20:38.959
I was, but my mom

20:37.375 --> 20:38.959
bailed me out.

20:39.417 --> 20:40.834
Well, that's great,

20:39.417 --> 20:40.834
but you got to leave.

20:40.875 --> 20:42.041
Bianca's going to be here

20:40.875 --> 20:42.041
any second.

20:42.083 --> 20:44.083
Wait, I thought you

20:42.083 --> 20:44.083
were done with Bianca.

20:44.125 --> 20:46.083
I was, but I called her

20:44.125 --> 20:46.083
and she's coming here tonight.

20:46.125 --> 20:47.125
Why?

20:47.166 --> 20:48.500
So I can get

20:47.166 --> 20:48.500
back together with her.

20:48.542 --> 20:49.333
And just her.

20:49.375 --> 20:50.333
And just her.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.291
Cool, but I need

20:50.750 --> 20:52.291
to talk to Piper.

20:52.333 --> 20:53.750
No, you can yell

20:52.333 --> 20:53.750
at Piper later.

20:54.875 --> 20:56.542
I'm not going to yell at her.

20:56.583 --> 20:58.625
Look, it was my fault

20:58.667 --> 21:01.625
that I broke

20:58.667 --> 21:01.625
her glass hat, so...

21:02.166 --> 21:03.375
voila.

21:03.417 --> 21:04.041
Whoa.

21:05.625 --> 21:07.667
You found her

21:05.625 --> 21:07.667
another glass hat?

21:08.125 --> 21:10.166
Yeah. I met this kid in juvy

21:08.125 --> 21:10.166
who hooked me up.

21:11.333 --> 21:14.583
It's the last one in America.

21:11.333 --> 21:14.583
It cost me 200 bucks.

21:14.625 --> 21:16.500
Aw, that's so sweet of you.

21:16.542 --> 21:17.917
Thanks.

21:16.542 --> 21:17.917
Now, where's Piper?

21:18.458 --> 21:19.875
Oh, she went next door

21:18.458 --> 21:19.875
to borrow a sledgehammer.

21:21.041 --> 21:22.709
So, why don't you come back

21:21.041 --> 21:22.709

21:21.041 --> 21:22.709

Hey, Piper.

21:25.667 --> 21:27.041
Jasper?

I thought the cops

21:27.083 --> 21:28.625
took you to jail.

21:28.667 --> 21:29.667
They did, but--

21:29.709 --> 21:30.583
Wait.

21:31.125 --> 21:32.583
Is that a glass hat?

21:33.083 --> 21:34.333
Yeah, it is.

21:34.375 --> 21:35.166
Jasper brought it for you.

21:35.750 --> 21:36.834
Wait, it's a real one?

21:36.875 --> 21:38.125
Yep.
