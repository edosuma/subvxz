WEBVTT

00:06.507 --> 00:08.476
Aw, look.

00:08.509 --> 00:11.179
I bet Grandma and Grandpa have
a fun day planned for you.

00:11.212 --> 00:12.746
No, we don't.
We can't watch Hope.

00:12.780 --> 00:15.015
In fact, you need to
watch Maw Maw for us.

00:15.049 --> 00:16.417
Your mother and I are competing

00:16.450 --> 00:18.152
in the Natesville
Wife Carrying Competition.

00:18.186 --> 00:19.887
Big Joe and his dwarf wife
got divorced.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.255
So we really have
a shot this year.

00:21.289 --> 00:22.590
Come on, guys. No fair.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.325
I watched Maw Maw
for you last weekend.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.027
Over the years, my parents had
developed a little strategy

00:27.061 --> 00:28.162
to get what they wanted.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.230
They called it

00:29.263 --> 00:31.232
"Bad Cop, Sad Cop."

00:31.265 --> 00:33.201
You turn off our gas,
I'll have you

00:33.234 --> 00:34.668
busted down to pumping gas.

00:34.702 --> 00:35.669
(spits)

00:35.703 --> 00:37.105
You can't turn off our gas.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.573
This rotisserie chicken
is barely cooked.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.642
If we eat this, we'll die!

00:43.911 --> 00:46.180
If you don't let us in,
I'll have you busted down

00:46.214 --> 00:48.949
from checking credentials
to checking urinal cakes.

00:48.982 --> 00:50.218
(spits)

00:50.251 --> 00:52.720
The Last Wish Foundation
said there'd be

00:52.753 --> 00:55.089
tickets for us.
(coughs twice)

01:02.396 --> 01:04.765
I will have you busted down

01:04.798 --> 01:06.800
from meter maid to regular maid.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.770
And trust me, that is a picnic
without a blanket.

01:09.803 --> 01:10.971
(spits)

01:11.004 --> 01:12.306
We're barely 62 minutes late.

01:12.340 --> 01:15.376
Please, I lost my job.
My dog died.

01:15.409 --> 01:18.212
My best friend didn't make
it back from the war...

01:18.246 --> 01:19.613
on obesity.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.315
I'm not gonna tow your car.

01:21.349 --> 01:23.651
The only thing I regret is
not being able

01:23.684 --> 01:25.386
to take back that ticket.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.820
(sobbing)

01:29.323 --> 01:30.491
If you don't watch Maw Maw,

01:30.524 --> 01:32.293
I will bust you down
to stepchild.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.561
And if you think
you had it bad before,

01:33.594 --> 01:36.597
you ain't seen nothing yet.
(spits)

01:36.630 --> 01:38.266
You just spit
on the coffee table.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.500
Jimmy, please?

01:39.533 --> 01:40.801
Business is slow.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.236
I have no retirement savings.

01:42.270 --> 01:43.671
My son's a disappointment.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.473
Well, yes, of course.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.341
I'll-I'll watch
Maw Maw for you.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.642
Great.

01:48.676 --> 01:49.743
We'll be out late.

01:49.777 --> 01:50.911
We totally could've
been cops.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.046
We'd clean this city up.

01:56.684 --> 01:58.619
Whoo!

01:58.652 --> 02:00.020
* Here we go

02:00.053 --> 02:03.023
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

02:03.056 --> 02:05.393
Hello, Chances.

02:07.895 --> 02:11.332
Thank you for meeting us
at the house, Wally.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.100
Not a problem.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.468
Ah.

02:14.502 --> 02:17.605
The old voodoo woman
who whitens my teeth

02:17.638 --> 02:19.139
lives around the corner.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.474
It's part of my makeover.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.176
How old do you think I look?
Whoa, whoa!

02:23.043 --> 02:24.378
There's no wrong answer.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.046
72.
Wrong answer.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.516
Why are you trying
to euthanize yourself?

02:28.549 --> 02:29.983
I've got a big case

02:30.017 --> 02:33.221
and the prosecutor has hired
two young "LILFs"

02:33.254 --> 02:35.122
to sway the jury.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.991
"Lawyers I'd Like
to Frolic with."

02:38.025 --> 02:38.859
Come on, guys.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.394
It's self-explanatory.

02:40.428 --> 02:41.629
Makes sense to me.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.130
Like how we knew O.J. was guilty

02:43.163 --> 02:44.898
because Marcia Clark was so hot.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.467
I'm not familiar with that case.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.001
But enough small talk.

02:48.035 --> 02:49.903
I have to get to my eyebrow wax

02:49.937 --> 02:50.871
in 15 minutes.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.373
What did you guys do now?

02:52.406 --> 02:53.507
We didn't do anything.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.142
Actually, this time,
it's me.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.578
Oh, you are gonna have so
much fun at the aquarium.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.313
All right.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.215
And I'll be right here
when you get back, okay?

03:01.249 --> 03:02.650
Oh, uh, Mrs. Chance, I'm sorry.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.318
I can't let Hope on the bus.

03:04.352 --> 03:06.554
Her permission slip needs to
be signed by a legal guardian.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.088
Oh, well, I'm married
to her father, so...

03:08.121 --> 03:09.089
No, I'm sorry.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.524
It's for the kids' safety.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.226
Really.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.661
Says the person who hired the
psycho with the face piercings

03:13.694 --> 03:15.763
and the teardrop tattoo
to drive the bus?

03:15.796 --> 03:17.531
That "psycho" is my husband.

03:17.565 --> 03:21.469
And the teardrop is a tribute
to the lost children of Sudan.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.940
So, I would like

03:26.974 --> 03:29.343
to officially adopt Hope.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.043
I see.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.279
Well, as much

03:31.312 --> 03:33.514
as I would like
to handle that...

03:33.547 --> 03:34.815
it's expensive.

03:35.649 --> 03:36.884
And these two

03:36.917 --> 03:38.252
still owe me

03:38.286 --> 03:39.853
from when they sued
the blue jean company

03:39.887 --> 03:41.422
over the "button-fly."

03:41.455 --> 03:42.790
Seriously, guys?

03:42.823 --> 03:44.292
I'm a busy man
and those people have stolen

03:44.325 --> 03:45.359
minutes from my life.

03:45.393 --> 03:46.360
I-I'm sure that they intend

03:46.394 --> 03:48.396
to pay you back... right?

03:49.797 --> 03:52.266
Have you heard of something
called "Burt Bucks"?

03:52.300 --> 03:53.467
Yes.

03:53.501 --> 03:54.968
I'm the one that got you off

03:55.002 --> 03:56.236
the counterfeiting charge.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.938
You didn't pay me
for that either.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.407
Well, sorry, Sabrina.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.974
I guess you'll never be
Hope's real mom.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.075
We tried.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.944
Wait, I'm starting to think

04:03.977 --> 04:06.614
that one hot, young stud
might not be enough

04:06.647 --> 04:07.581
to win this case.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.082
So, I'll do the adoption,

04:09.116 --> 04:12.753
if you two sit at my table
as extra eye candy.

04:12.786 --> 04:13.754
(gasps)

04:13.787 --> 04:15.088
It would be so fun

04:15.122 --> 04:16.156
to pretend to be lawyers.

04:16.189 --> 04:17.425
I could be just
like the one

04:17.458 --> 04:19.159
Ally McBeal played
on that show.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.161
I could be like
that cool army guy on JAG.

04:21.194 --> 04:23.731
I've always wanted
an excuse to wear white pants.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.098
We'll do it.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.767
With you two lookers,

04:26.800 --> 04:28.602
I won't need this anymore.

04:28.636 --> 04:29.603
Now...

04:29.637 --> 04:30.638
if one of you wouldn't mind

04:30.671 --> 04:31.939
helping me...

04:31.972 --> 04:35.042
pull off this tape.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.280
(yelling)

04:43.216 --> 04:44.585
JIMMY:
With Wally on board,
we could finally

04:44.618 --> 04:46.854
make the adoption official.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.889
How about a little more teeth?

04:49.557 --> 04:51.359
Perfect.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.293
Cool, we get
an official picture.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.328
Next.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.363
That's us.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.730
Here you go.

04:58.699 --> 04:59.967
Ooh.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.301
Okay, bye.

05:01.335 --> 05:04.204
I... I thought
you were gonna

05:04.237 --> 05:05.205
swear us in.

05:05.238 --> 05:06.707
This isn't an inauguration.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.509
We'll just get to
the picture then.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.844
This camera's only
for official business.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.714
No, I just officially adopted
this little girl, so...

05:13.747 --> 05:15.516
For official hunting licenses.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.651
Squab season starts tomorrow.

05:17.685 --> 05:20.888
Great, then we'll take one
family hunting license, please.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.656
Are you going
to go squab hunting?

05:22.690 --> 05:24.157
Yes, you know what? Yes.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.559
Here, come on.

05:27.260 --> 05:28.629
My family and I would like

05:28.662 --> 05:30.998
one license to kill
whatever a squab is.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.233
I don't issue licenses
to non-hunters.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.234
It cheapens it.

05:34.267 --> 05:35.536
Come on, honestly.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.137
How hard is it really
to just, like,

05:37.170 --> 05:39.507
click your little button
and take a picture

05:39.540 --> 05:41.074
of me and my family?

05:42.242 --> 05:43.744
You know, I-I got
a camera on my phone.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.212
We could just take
a picture outside.

05:45.245 --> 05:47.381
They got a-a nice rosebush,
and that-that statue

05:47.415 --> 05:49.983
of that blind woman
holding weights.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.218
Yeah.

05:51.251 --> 05:53.353
It just... (groans)

05:53.387 --> 05:54.755
Oh, someone's

05:54.788 --> 05:56.356
adopting a puppy.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.058
I've got to get
a picture of this.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.259
Oh, come on!

05:59.292 --> 06:00.428
Really?

06:04.798 --> 06:07.167
This Polish gentlemen said,

06:07.200 --> 06:09.169
"I didn't know it was a penis."

06:09.202 --> 06:10.671
Hold for laughter.

06:10.704 --> 06:11.939
Salute jury.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.576
I saw this lawyer at a trial
in Florida

06:15.609 --> 06:17.578
open with a knock-knock joke.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.379
Trust me.

06:19.413 --> 06:20.714
It killed.

06:20.748 --> 06:23.250
How about when you say,
"He's not guilty,"

06:23.283 --> 06:25.453
I'll try to get the whole
courtroom to say,

06:25.486 --> 06:27.721
"How not guilty is he?"

06:27.755 --> 06:29.757
No, no, no, no.
You-you say nothing.

06:29.790 --> 06:32.392
But we stayed up all night
watching Matlock.

06:32.426 --> 06:34.394
Burt does a great
Southern lawyer.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.764
(odd Southern accent):
My name is Brown.

06:36.797 --> 06:39.867
And I am against
this board of education.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.301
I admire your commitment.

06:41.334 --> 06:42.770
But I also know
how difficult it is

06:42.803 --> 06:45.138
for you to button your fly.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.406
Therefore,

06:46.440 --> 06:48.976
you-you stay quiet.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.625
My God.

07:05.793 --> 07:08.796
She's got one
good-looking posse.

07:08.829 --> 07:12.500
All right,
just like we practiced.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.036
Counselor.
Counselor.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.944
Okay.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.113
Game on.

07:27.347 --> 07:30.150
Wow, that took
a lot out of me.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.252
Being a lawyer's a lot
harder than I thought.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.088
Now I know why they
charge by the hour.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.157
That was only,
like, 30 seconds.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.291
I'm exhausted.

07:38.325 --> 07:39.693
(yawns)

07:41.194 --> 07:42.796
So, I'd been in labor
for four hours

07:42.830 --> 07:44.464
and it's pouring rain
outside.

07:44.498 --> 07:46.534
But right then
when my Skylar was born,

07:46.567 --> 07:48.101
a ray of light came
through the window.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.704
I know exactly
what you're talking about.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.508
What was it like
when you first saw Hope?

07:54.542 --> 07:56.610
It was really...

07:56.644 --> 07:57.778
magical.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.212
Giving birth to Hope was

07:59.246 --> 08:01.615
probably the best thing
I ever did with my life.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.350
Really I was just lucky

08:03.383 --> 08:06.854
that Jimmy was there
to help me push it
out of my body.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.989
You guys took
baby classes?

08:09.022 --> 08:11.158
Yeah, we took, uh, two years.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.660
Jimmy and I were very,

08:12.693 --> 08:16.664
very serious about baby birth.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.636
First, she seemed upset
that the adoption

08:22.670 --> 08:24.237
was just a rubber stamp.

08:24.271 --> 08:25.806
Then, next thing I know,

08:25.839 --> 08:27.407
she's saying she breast-fed Hope

08:27.440 --> 08:28.676
two gallons of milk a day.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.210
Now, I am no expert.

08:30.243 --> 08:33.246
But this seems like a lot
for a 95-pound woman.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.882
Maybe Sabrina feels
like she missed out

08:34.915 --> 08:37.217
on the whole "having a baby"
part of motherhood.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.752
Yeah.

08:38.786 --> 08:41.822
To us, giving birth
just seems like

08:41.855 --> 08:44.157
a painful, disgusting,

08:44.191 --> 08:46.059
cruel joke of biology.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.562
But to women,
it's their Super Bowl.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.764
When my non-birth mother was
feeling the way Sabrina is,

08:50.798 --> 08:53.233
my other mother got the ladies
from her rugby team together

08:53.266 --> 08:56.069
and they threw her
a rebirthing ceremony.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.104
Where do you go for that?

08:57.137 --> 08:59.172
Well, my moms went to a bar

08:59.206 --> 09:00.741
in Vermont called
Saloon B. Anthony.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.442
But you could do it yourself.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.077
How am I supposed
to do a rebirthing?

09:04.111 --> 09:05.278
I've never seen an actual birth.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.413
Hope was born in a jail.

09:06.446 --> 09:07.715
Frank and I could help you.

09:07.748 --> 09:08.949
Oh, yeah, totally.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.084
Rebirthing ceremonies
are simple.

09:12.252 --> 09:15.188
Sometimes insomnia
can drive a man

09:15.222 --> 09:18.859
to the deep dark corners
of the Internet.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.128
That is when
the Polish man said,

09:21.161 --> 09:22.930
"I didn't know it was a penis."

09:22.963 --> 09:26.133
(jurors chuckling)
She stole my joke!

09:26.166 --> 09:27.768
My entire opening argument

09:27.801 --> 09:29.603
was built on that joke!

09:29.637 --> 09:31.639
...the only thing
that you'll come to realize...

09:31.672 --> 09:33.807
is...

09:33.841 --> 09:35.208
that man,

09:35.242 --> 09:36.309
Bobby Bowman,

09:36.343 --> 09:38.111
is a moped thief.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.714
And I will prove that to you

09:40.748 --> 09:42.249
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.351
Mr. Phipps,
your opening statement?

09:46.319 --> 09:49.790
I have an even better
opening joke.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.892
But before I tell it,

09:51.925 --> 09:55.428
have any of you ever been
molested by a clown?

10:03.671 --> 10:04.805
I've got nothing.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.106
You can do this.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.241
Remember, you don't
have to be that good

10:08.275 --> 10:10.510
because we're that beautiful.

10:15.849 --> 10:18.018
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

10:18.051 --> 10:19.519
me and my...

10:19.552 --> 10:22.622
noticeably handsome colleagues

10:22.656 --> 10:25.959
have over 1,000 years

10:25.993 --> 10:28.628
of law school

10:28.662 --> 10:30.097
between the three of us.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.432
I dare you to not be

10:32.465 --> 10:33.633
both intellectually

10:33.667 --> 10:36.636
and physically aroused.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.373
Nothing more, Your Honor...

10:41.341 --> 10:43.276
...because all I see are stars.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.713
(all gasp)

10:49.216 --> 10:52.652
How not guilty is he?

11:00.193 --> 11:02.195
Don't worry, I'm not gonna die.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.064
I have it on the authority

11:04.097 --> 11:06.166
of a very reputable
fortune teller

11:06.199 --> 11:09.369
that I would live to be...

11:09.402 --> 11:11.571
Wait, how old am I?

11:13.506 --> 11:16.543
Well, at least our careers
as pretend lawyers

11:16.576 --> 11:18.846
are ending without us
ever losing a case.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.714
I'm really gonna
miss these glasses.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.149
They make me feel so smart.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.851
Wait, you guys cannot go.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.853
I can't afford another lawyer.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.387
We really want to help, but...

11:27.420 --> 11:29.757
we're not the kind of
lawyers you think we are.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.191
Okay, so what's your specialty?

11:31.224 --> 11:33.060
Cases with special victims,

11:33.093 --> 11:34.694
criminals with intent.

11:34.728 --> 11:37.330
You know, ripped from the
headlines kind of stuff.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.099
Okay, look, I'm innocent.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.601
All right,
you guys are my only hope.

11:41.634 --> 11:42.870
This is serious.

11:42.903 --> 11:43.937
He needs us.

11:43.971 --> 11:45.372
I know, but we can't do this.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.774
We're in way over our heads.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.575
You know who else was in
over her head?

11:48.608 --> 11:50.177
Reese Witherspoon
in Legally Blonde,

11:50.210 --> 11:51.511
and she never gave up.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.880
Neither did the dog lawyer

11:52.913 --> 11:54.848
in Chihuahua Attorney:
Justice Bites.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.717
And if that dog can win a case
against the Supreme Court,

11:57.751 --> 11:59.953
we can do this.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.521
Your Highness,

12:01.554 --> 12:02.722
we'd like to continue on

12:02.756 --> 12:04.124
without Mr. Phipps.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.359
Just be prepared to keep us
on a short leash,

12:06.393 --> 12:08.528
but ultimately,
you'll see where we're going

12:08.561 --> 12:10.663
with this and allow it.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.567
Just a few more steps.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.603
Ooh, please be a tetherball,
please be a tetherball.

12:16.636 --> 12:17.971
* Ta-da!

12:19.239 --> 12:20.373
Everything about this scares me.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.075
Jimmy, what the hell
is going on?

12:22.109 --> 12:23.310
It's a rebirthing ceremony.

12:23.343 --> 12:24.778
Surprise!

12:24.812 --> 12:27.047
We're going to simulate
childbirth so you can feel

12:27.080 --> 12:28.048
like a real mom.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.117
Welcome to your Super Bowl.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.718
Jimmy, why would you do this?

12:31.751 --> 12:33.420
Because you seemed so upset
at City Hall

12:33.453 --> 12:36.123
when they didn't make a big deal
out of the adoption.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.724
I thought that, you know,
you wanted more

12:37.757 --> 12:39.259
of a motherhood moment.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.228
No, I-I just was upset
about the bureaucracy of it.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.463
Like, why should a squab killer
get a photo and we don't?

12:43.496 --> 12:45.799
Why did you lie to the mothers
of Skylar and Skylar?

12:45.833 --> 12:47.100
I mean,
I heard you telling them

12:47.134 --> 12:48.468
that you gave birth to Hope.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.237
Oh, you heard that?
Yeah.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.972
The other moms were talking
about their baby stories,

12:52.005 --> 12:53.506
and I just didn't feel
like getting

12:53.540 --> 12:54.808
into the whole thing about Hope.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.576
It's not a big
deal, it's just...

12:56.609 --> 12:59.279
Sometimes I lie when it's easier
than telling the truth.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.481
Look, I'm all right
if we don't do this,

13:01.514 --> 13:02.482
but there was

13:02.515 --> 13:03.884
another person helping.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.089
Hi.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.590
She's been practicing all day.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.658
(sighs)

13:11.691 --> 13:12.826
What the heck?

13:12.860 --> 13:13.861
All right, fine.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.362
Then let's get to it
because...

13:15.395 --> 13:16.796
(gasps)

13:16.830 --> 13:18.065
...your water just broke.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.668
Mr. Lennox,
would you point to the man

13:21.701 --> 13:23.636
you saw steal your moped?

13:24.537 --> 13:25.672
Bend down and tie your shoe.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.374
I'm pretty sure
he'd just point lower.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.876
Let the record show
that Mr. Lennox

13:28.909 --> 13:31.211
pointed to the defendant.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.723
That didn't work.

13:43.756 --> 13:46.359
Do that "withdrawn" trick
they do on Law and Order.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.395
Yeah, yeah.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.498
Mr. Lennox,

13:51.531 --> 13:54.734
is it true that you
decapitate puppies as a hobby?

13:55.402 --> 13:56.203
Withdrawn.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.304
Weren't you a member

13:57.337 --> 13:58.538
of the Taliban?

13:58.571 --> 14:00.240
Withdrawn.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.675
A pedophile? Withdrawn.

14:02.709 --> 14:03.810
A thief? Withdrawn.

14:03.843 --> 14:07.180
Defecated in an avocado field?

14:07.214 --> 14:08.348
Withdrawn.

14:08.381 --> 14:09.883
Mr. Chance, enough of this.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.318
Damn Law and Order

14:11.351 --> 14:13.921
ruined an entire generation
of lawyers.

14:14.754 --> 14:17.090
I'm calling a recess.

14:18.892 --> 14:20.260
Ooh, recess.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.661
Maybe it would be good
for us to go outside

14:21.694 --> 14:23.096
and run around
for about ten minutes.

14:28.801 --> 14:31.071
Okay, contractions are starting.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.773
You gonna go natural
or you want some drugs?

14:33.806 --> 14:35.175
Wait, do you
actually have drugs?

14:35.208 --> 14:36.776
There's no time for drugs!

14:36.809 --> 14:37.610
This baby's coming!

14:37.644 --> 14:38.946
Brace yourselves.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.080
Breathe, Sabrina.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.848
Come on, baby, you can do it.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.083
(exhaling, huffing)

14:43.116 --> 14:44.417
This is actually
kind of exciting, Jimmy.

14:44.451 --> 14:46.053
Yeah, your breathing is great.

14:46.086 --> 14:49.056
Now, pick a focal
point and stare at it.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.357
Wow.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.591
Yeah, I read a book.

14:51.624 --> 14:52.960
(huffing, exhaling)

14:52.993 --> 14:54.261
I'm really glad
we didn't take those drugs.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.595
I feel like
it's really important

14:55.628 --> 14:56.964
for me to be present
through this.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.765
When this is over,
I call dibs on the faux-gina.

14:58.798 --> 15:01.301
I want to do more of these
for deserving barren couples.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.405
Okay, here we go.

15:05.438 --> 15:08.308
We are having a baby!
I know!

15:08.341 --> 15:09.977
But soon, right?

15:10.010 --> 15:12.079
'Cause I feel like she's been
in that tube for a while.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.546
Mommy, I'm stuck!

15:13.580 --> 15:14.747
What?

15:14.781 --> 15:15.882
Wait, how can she be stuck?

15:15.915 --> 15:17.317
In the spirit of realism,

15:17.350 --> 15:19.252
someone may have stuffed
the tube with spaghetti.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.054
What? Why would you do
something like that?

15:21.088 --> 15:23.423
Before we start
Monday morning quarterbacking,

15:23.456 --> 15:26.126
just remember we threw
this together in an afternoon.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.760
Hope, hang on.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.762
Daddy's coming.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.164
And so I looked out the window,

15:31.198 --> 15:32.932
and that's when I saw him

15:32.966 --> 15:34.267
steal my moped.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.969
Aha!

15:36.003 --> 15:39.106
And when was the last time
that window was cleaned?

15:39.139 --> 15:40.240
The window was open.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.774
That's very convenient.

15:41.808 --> 15:44.477
Let the record show

15:44.511 --> 15:45.612
that that was

15:45.645 --> 15:47.780
very convenient.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.952
We're screwed.
We've tried every legal maneuver

15:52.986 --> 15:55.188
we've ever seen
on Law and Order, Boston Legal,

15:55.222 --> 15:56.956
even that episode
of Facts of Life

15:56.990 --> 15:58.491
where Tootie
got racially profiled.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.127
That guy is totally lying.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.995
I don't know whether
to scream or cry.

16:02.029 --> 16:04.297
That's it.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.438
You're a liar, Lennox,

16:11.471 --> 16:12.772
and I am gonna

16:12.805 --> 16:15.642
bust you down
from star witness to loser

16:15.675 --> 16:17.277
who rents the movie Witness.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.578
(spits)

16:20.013 --> 16:22.382
How can you send
an innocent man to jail?

16:22.415 --> 16:23.450
He has a slight frame

16:23.483 --> 16:24.717
and delicate features,

16:24.751 --> 16:26.286
and that's great
for an underwear model,

16:26.319 --> 16:27.720
but it is horrible
for a prisoner.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.056
Wait a minute.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.490
It's been driving me crazy.

16:30.523 --> 16:31.558
I knew I recognized you guys
from somewhere.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.326
I saw you work this routine

16:33.360 --> 16:34.694
on a meter maid.

16:34.727 --> 16:37.564
I will have you busted down
from meter maid

16:37.597 --> 16:39.466
to regular maid,
and trust me,

16:39.499 --> 16:41.501
that is a picnic
without a blanket.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.403
(whispering): Oh, crap,
this isn't gonna work.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.238
He knows
about "bad cop, sad cop."

16:48.441 --> 16:49.842
What's taking so long?

16:49.876 --> 16:51.178
Oh, it's really slippery.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.546
Oh, here, maybe if I try to...

16:53.580 --> 16:55.748
(groaning, coughs)

16:56.516 --> 16:57.717
Ah, I can't breathe!

16:57.750 --> 16:58.918
I can't breathe!

17:00.720 --> 17:02.389
The cord is wrapped
around his neck!

17:02.422 --> 17:04.657
We got to get him
out of there right away!

17:04.691 --> 17:07.260
Sabrina, push,
push with all your might!

17:07.294 --> 17:08.761
(screams)

17:08.795 --> 17:10.397
You can do it! Harder!

17:10.430 --> 17:13.032
God, I can't believe you idiots
thought this would work!

17:13.066 --> 17:16.736
Sabrina, sometimes I think
you forget I'm your boss.

17:20.573 --> 17:21.941
Mama, help us.

17:21.974 --> 17:23.710
I have to do something.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.458
It's okay, it's okay.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.060
You're okay; Mommy's got you.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.796
(wailing)

17:46.733 --> 17:48.635
(panting)

17:48.668 --> 17:50.870
(coughing, spits)

17:50.903 --> 17:53.240
It's a boy!

17:53.273 --> 17:54.341
(chuckles)

17:56.243 --> 17:58.878
So, if you'll agree

17:58.911 --> 18:00.713
to dismiss all these tickets,

18:00.747 --> 18:03.116
we can definitely get our client
to plead guilty.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.652
Traditionally, plea deals do
not help the defendant's lawyers

18:05.685 --> 18:07.887
avoid paying parking fines.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.989
I got it!

18:10.022 --> 18:11.391
We reject the deal.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.126
I offered no deal.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.327
Janice, get it on the record

18:14.361 --> 18:16.896
that I did not offer anyone
a deal.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.665
(chuckles)

18:20.533 --> 18:22.435
According to
your previous testimony,

18:22.469 --> 18:26.273
when exactly did you see
my client

18:26.306 --> 18:28.941
stealing your moped

18:28.975 --> 18:30.410
on Pine Street?

18:30.443 --> 18:32.612
May 19, 5:00 p.m.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.447
And is it also your testimony

18:34.481 --> 18:37.016
that you saw
my esteemed lawyer husband

18:37.049 --> 18:38.818
and myself,

18:38.851 --> 18:41.921
also an esteemed attorney
at law,

18:41.954 --> 18:45.158
getting a ticket
on Elmwood Avenue?

18:45.192 --> 18:46.693
Yes.
Would you mind reading

18:46.726 --> 18:49.696
what's printed
on this ticket for me?

18:49.729 --> 18:51.431
(clears throat)

18:51.464 --> 18:55.368
"May 19, 5:00 p.m."

18:56.469 --> 18:57.870
Ladies and gentlemen...

18:59.038 --> 19:00.840
...how could one man

19:00.873 --> 19:03.343
be in two different places,
ten miles apart from each other,

19:03.376 --> 19:04.544
at the exact same time?

19:04.577 --> 19:05.945
Is it because,

19:05.978 --> 19:08.181
I don't know,
he has a time machine?

19:08.215 --> 19:11.784
Or is it because he is
a liar?

19:11.818 --> 19:12.852
Fine!

19:12.885 --> 19:13.886
I admit it.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.121
I lied.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.556
I didn't see him
steal my moped.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.725
I just said it because

19:18.758 --> 19:21.160
that son of a bitch slept
with my girlfriend.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.663
Case dismissed.

19:23.696 --> 19:24.864
JUDGE:
Hey!

19:24.897 --> 19:27.234
I'm supposed to say that.

19:30.036 --> 19:32.205
(sighs)

19:32.239 --> 19:33.940
Oh, you're crying.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.075
Hey, I...

19:36.108 --> 19:38.645
I thought this wasn't
that big of a deal for you.

19:38.678 --> 19:39.712
I lied.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.348
(sniffles)

19:41.381 --> 19:44.183
Sometimes I lie when it's easier
than telling the truth.

19:44.217 --> 19:46.553
I'm-I'm sorry
if-if I went a little overboard.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.087
I'm not.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.422
Neither of us was there

19:49.456 --> 19:51.190
the first time
Hope was born, and...

19:51.224 --> 19:52.525
(sighs)

19:52.559 --> 19:54.093
In a really weird way,

19:54.126 --> 19:56.363
I feel like it was good
for all of us.

19:56.396 --> 19:59.299
'Cause we did it together.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.001
Like a real family.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.103
So this was good idea?

20:04.136 --> 20:07.106
No, it was a horrible idea.

20:08.241 --> 20:10.577
But it worked.

20:10.610 --> 20:13.045
And you are the sweetest man
in the world for doing it.

20:13.079 --> 20:15.448
JIMMY: Hope's rebirth
gave us something

20:15.482 --> 20:17.216
that we both needed.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.085
The experience
of doing something together

20:19.118 --> 20:20.887
that neither of us
had done before.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.556
(smooching)

20:24.791 --> 20:26.259
And we weren't the only ones.

20:26.293 --> 20:28.395
What do you think we should do
with these now?

20:28.428 --> 20:29.962
I guess we get rid of them.

20:29.996 --> 20:32.365
We're probably not gonna pretend
to be lawyers again.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.534
Yeah.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.703
They just made me feel so smart.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.371
Hey, it wasn't just the glasses.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.906
You were amazing.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.574
You outsmarted
professional lawyers.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.576
You kept an innocent man
from going to jail.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.111
It wasn't just me.

20:45.144 --> 20:47.280
If you hadn't thought of
doing "bad cop, sad cop,"

20:47.314 --> 20:49.716
then Aaron would've
never blown his alibi.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.217
Ah...

20:51.250 --> 20:54.754
You know, I bet we
could've been lawyers,

20:54.787 --> 20:56.289
if we'd done
things differently.

20:56.323 --> 20:58.224
Like go to
law school and college

20:58.257 --> 20:59.626
and finished high school.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.961
That sounds like
a lot of effort.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.630
And those suspenders chafed.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.765
Yeah, and all that posing...

21:05.798 --> 21:06.966
My lips hurt.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.635
I think I over-pouted.

21:08.668 --> 21:11.170
Yeah, I'm happy to retire
having never lost a case.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.939
Yeah, me, too.

21:12.972 --> 21:15.508
But I think I'll wait till
morning to throw these out.

21:15.542 --> 21:16.843
Good idea.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.184
Maybe if we sleep in 'em,

21:25.217 --> 21:27.854
we'll have smart dreams.

21:27.887 --> 21:32.459
