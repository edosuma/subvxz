WEBVTT

01:35.763 --> 01:38.015
Big shipment.
Armed guards. Late night.

01:38.099 --> 01:40.351
What are the chances
this little transaction is legal?

01:40.434 --> 01:42.520
<i>Just make sure you know
What you're up against</i>

01:42.603 --> 01:43.603
<i>before you jump in.</i>

01:43.646 --> 01:45.564
Don't worry. I've got it covered.

01:45.648 --> 01:46.816
Shut the doors.

01:48.526 --> 01:50.069
We don't need company for this.

01:53.114 --> 01:55.366
- He's clean.
- Let's see the merchandise.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.826
Cash first.

02:04.375 --> 02:06.502
I assume the amount is satisfactory.

02:06.585 --> 02:11.257
Oh, yes, and I'm sure you'll find
the firepowerjust as satisfying.

02:21.058 --> 02:22.058
Deal's over.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.813
You idiot. You're ruining everything.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.315
That's what I'm here for.

03:25.664 --> 03:26.832
Hold your fire.

03:33.589 --> 03:35.216
He blew the whole sting, Commissioner.

03:35.299 --> 03:36.717
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

03:36.801 --> 03:38.344
Sorry doesn't begin to cut it.

03:51.273 --> 03:54.068
- Not bad.
- I learned from the best.

03:54.151 --> 03:57.071
If only I could figure out
how he made those little tea cakes.

03:57.154 --> 04:00.241
- Crumpets.
- Right, crumpets.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.327
All right, we've made
the requisite small talk.

04:03.411 --> 04:04.787
Did he tell you what happened?

04:04.870 --> 04:06.747
I heard some mistakes were made.

04:06.831 --> 04:10.126
Mistakes? It took us 12 months
to set up that sting.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.169
Men put their lives on the line for it.

04:12.253 --> 04:13.754
The boy is still learning.

04:13.838 --> 04:17.466
The boy is a hothead.
I've been doing some checking on him.

04:17.550 --> 04:18.717
I know about his record.

04:18.801 --> 04:21.971
Three months atjuvie.
Another mistake, I suppose.

04:22.054 --> 04:23.240
He seems to make a lot of them.

04:23.264 --> 04:25.599
Just make sure this one was his last.

04:38.195 --> 04:41.407
In the last four years,
under my husband's leadership,

04:41.490 --> 04:45.661
the DA's office has put
nine organized crime chiefs behind bars,

04:45.744 --> 04:49.582
initiated a no-tolerance policy
on unregistered guns,

04:49.665 --> 04:52.960
and reduced the plea bargain ratio
of violent offenders,

04:53.043 --> 04:56.005
keeping them off the streets
and in prison, where they belong.

05:01.010 --> 05:03.262
But he needs your help
if he's going to continue

05:03.345 --> 05:05.264
to serve the needs of this city.

05:05.347 --> 05:08.684
Serve the needs of the special-interest
fat cats, you mean.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.362
The whole political system is corrupt.

05:28.162 --> 05:31.916
Money. That's what it's all about, man.
Well, I'm gonna stop it.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.585
Take out all the big money
in one big blast.

05:36.795 --> 05:39.048
Go ahead, Commissioner,
make your call.

05:39.131 --> 05:40.799
I've wired the whole ballroom.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.261
No one gets out.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.019
You fried it.

06:00.861 --> 06:01.862
[yelpingl

06:04.907 --> 06:07.868
My vest protects me, Batman,
like your suit.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.706
Only better.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.211
Huh?

06:22.591 --> 06:24.969
Stinking establishment flunky.

06:33.394 --> 06:36.021
You're all infected
with the disease of bureaucracy,

06:36.397 --> 06:38.023
but I know the cure, man.

06:38.107 --> 06:39.858
All of you must be destroyed.

06:39.942 --> 06:40.942
All of you!

06:41.026 --> 06:42.903
Not if I have anything to say about it.

06:43.821 --> 06:44.863
Ahh!

07:23.360 --> 07:24.570
Get back, man!

07:24.653 --> 07:26.447
I'II blow out this whole floor.

07:26.739 --> 07:27.739
I don't think so.

07:51.305 --> 07:55.184
Go ahead. Take me in.
You know I'll get out.

07:55.351 --> 07:59.188
And when I do,
I'll finish this job once and for all.

07:59.438 --> 08:01.815
You're right,
and I can't let that happen.

08:09.490 --> 08:10.574
No!

08:11.825 --> 08:12.825
Don't!

08:17.331 --> 08:18.457
Drop it.

08:18.707 --> 08:19.792
Drop it!

08:19.875 --> 08:20.918
[gunshofl

08:21.960 --> 08:23.045
Commissioner.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.215
Hold it!

08:38.769 --> 08:39.769
Is he...

08:40.020 --> 08:41.146
Dead.

08:41.647 --> 08:42.731
This is my fault.

08:42.815 --> 08:44.858
I should've done something sooner,

08:44.942 --> 08:47.152
but now I'm finally
going to put an end to it.

08:47.236 --> 08:49.113
To what, Commissioner?

08:49.196 --> 08:50.364
To Batman.

09:03.502 --> 09:05.045
I told you, he's not home.

09:05.129 --> 09:06.714
Do you mind
if we search for him?

09:06.797 --> 09:09.925
As a matter of fact, I do.
Is he in some kind of trouble?

09:10.050 --> 09:13.095
Look, all I know is the commissioner
wants him brought in for questioning.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.013
If you see him, let us know.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.315
You've heard, haven't you?

09:34.324 --> 09:36.076
Where is he? Where's McGinnis?

09:36.452 --> 09:37.453
Not here.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.455
When he comes,
you have to turn him over.

09:39.538 --> 09:42.124
If you take him in,
you'll expose his secret.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.085
And mine, and yours.

09:45.419 --> 09:48.130
What other choice do I have? Do we have?

09:49.381 --> 09:52.634
Believe me, I'm acutely aware
of the ramifications.

09:52.885 --> 09:55.095
I have a husband
running for re-election.

09:55.179 --> 09:57.931
How long do you think that” last
when this hits the Web?

09:58.265 --> 10:01.894
No one can protect us this time, Bruce.
He went too far.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.109
Terry?

10:09.276 --> 10:10.861
Bruce, you gotta help me.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.821
I don't know why,
but the cops are after me.

10:12.988 --> 10:15.574
Did you think you could get away
with killing Mad Stan?

10:15.741 --> 10:16.825
Killing?

10:18.035 --> 10:19.115
What are you talking about?

10:19.369 --> 10:22.039
Barbara was an eyewitness.
She saw everything.

10:22.164 --> 10:25.250
All I did was hit him with my elbow.
He was knocked out, not dead.

10:25.334 --> 10:26.460
She wouldn't lie.

10:26.960 --> 10:27.961
And I would?

10:29.129 --> 10:30.129
Where are you?

10:31.131 --> 10:33.801
If you want me to trust you,
you've gotta trust me.

10:35.177 --> 10:36.178
I'm at Max's.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.013
Stay there.

10:40.140 --> 10:44.853
Computer, access Grand Hotel security.
Video link, 10:30 pm.

10:44.937 --> 10:47.064
Parking garage, level six.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.342
So?

11:15.425 --> 11:17.302
<i>I checked
the hotel security tapes.</i>

11:17.386 --> 11:18.386
Yeah?

11:19.388 --> 11:21.765
There was some kind of
electronic interference.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.308
I couldn't see anything.

11:23.559 --> 11:26.061
Oh, geez, Bruce, you gotta believe me.

11:26.270 --> 11:28.480
I do. It's too coincidental.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.169
There's something else going on here.

11:30.232 --> 11:31.232
What do we do?

11:31.692 --> 11:34.736
I'm trying to enhance the video.
It's going to take awhile.

11:34.820 --> 11:38.407
In the meantime,
I think we should pay Mad Stan a visit.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.160
I'm in.

12:24.286 --> 12:26.622
Good. Now find room B-15.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.473
Ifslocked.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.792
- <i>Cold?</i>
- No, creepy.

13:13.919 --> 13:17.005
So, where does Mad Stan, um, reside?

13:17.089 --> 13:19.633
<i>Police files say
row double-J, number six.</i>

13:35.482 --> 13:38.986
- They haven't done the autopsy yet.
<i>- Good.</i> We can do our <i>own.</i>

13:39.111 --> 13:41.321
Hey, I had trouble
with the frog in bio lab.

13:41.446 --> 13:42.948
<i>An electronic scan
should tell us</i>

13:43.031 --> 13:45.158
<i>what we need to know. Open it.</i>

13:48.370 --> 13:50.831
<i>Whoa! Now I'm really creeped.</i>

13:50.998 --> 13:52.958
- What is it?
- He's gone.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.669
Somebody must've gotten here first,
taken the body.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.629
Or maybe it was never there
to begin with.

13:57.713 --> 14:00.048
Hold on. I hear something.

14:15.397 --> 14:16.397
<i>Well?</i>

14:16.440 --> 14:18.150
Maybe it was the air conditioning.

14:20.318 --> 14:21.820
Man, I must've tripped something!

14:32.247 --> 14:33.665
<i>“Mot fl Stay where you are.</i>

14:35.333 --> 14:36.585
<i>Stop right there.</i>

14:44.968 --> 14:47.846
You're surrounded, Batman.
There's no escape.

14:48.180 --> 14:49.306
<i>You might as well surrender.</i>

14:49.389 --> 14:51.391
Sorry, not in my vocabulary.

14:58.774 --> 14:59.900
Oh, I'm fragged.

15:32.682 --> 15:35.268
We got him, Commissioner.
He's not going anywhere.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.445
He's gone.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.992
Give me a UV sweep, now!

16:06.550 --> 16:07.843
There he is. Stop him.

16:18.854 --> 16:22.691
Satcom recon, I need a trace
on car 29-Abel, right now.

16:24.943 --> 16:25.943
<i>What now?</i>

16:26.153 --> 16:29.197
Dump the vehicle as fast as you can.
They'll have a tracer on it.

16:29.281 --> 16:31.867
<i>You should be flying above
Old Town right now.</i>

16:31.950 --> 16:34.953
<i>There's an underground tunnel
behind the old Majestic theatre.</i>

16:35.036 --> 16:37.414
<i>Find it and link up with me
when you get there.</i>

17:00.854 --> 17:02.022
What took you so long?

17:20.081 --> 17:22.167
<i>Data reclamation completed.</i>

17:22.417 --> 17:24.419
Good. Now we'll see
what really happened.

17:24.586 --> 17:25.586
Play sequence.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.434
Why would Barbara
see something different?

17:39.517 --> 17:41.144
Play again.

17:43.438 --> 17:44.438
Freeze frame.

17:49.611 --> 17:50.611
Enlarge.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.240
Enhance.

18:20.350 --> 18:21.935
- Yes?
- It's me.

18:22.185 --> 18:24.062
You're not authorized
to use this frequency.

18:24.312 --> 18:25.312
Get off it, now.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.232
<i>Barbara,
you have to listen to me.</i>

18:27.440 --> 18:29.609
Wrong. Those days are long gone, Bruce.

18:36.157 --> 18:38.076
- Terry.
- A little busy right now.

18:38.285 --> 18:40.203
Put your visor through a frequency scan.

18:40.370 --> 18:43.039
<i>- Because I know who's behind all this.</i>

18:45.709 --> 18:49.254
<i>And I'm betting he's there right now,
hiding behind an illusion.</i>

18:51.131 --> 18:52.215
Spellbinder.

18:54.759 --> 18:56.052
Hold your fire.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.766
This better not be a trick.

19:01.850 --> 19:02.892
Sorry.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.093
Didn't know you had a shadow,
did you, Commissioner?

19:19.117 --> 19:20.118
Spellbinder?

19:20.410 --> 19:22.120
He was there
at the garage with us.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.997
He used his powers
to create an illusion.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.416
That's why I saw you kill Mad Stan.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.668
But I didn't. I wouldn't.

19:28.793 --> 19:31.171
You were so ready
to believe the worst.

19:31.713 --> 19:32.881
It was easy.

19:32.964 --> 19:34.090
Lock him up.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.847
Sorry, kid. I guess I blew it.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.349
I've been there.

19:51.107 --> 19:53.318
<i>So, the commissioner
calls her personally and says</i>

19:53.401 --> 19:55.987
<i>she just wanted to award me
with a student service medal.</i>

19:56.404 --> 19:59.074
So now, I'm in like schway city
with my mom.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.993
<i>- She's even taking me out to celebrate.</i>
- That's <i>nice.</i>

20:02.160 --> 20:04.746
You know, this could have been
a bad scene.

20:05.038 --> 20:06.278
If you hadn't believed in me...

20:06.331 --> 20:07.957
Old news.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.201
By the way, have you heard
about your so-called victim?

20:10.251 --> 20:12.420
Mad Stan? Did they finally find him?

20:12.670 --> 20:13.755
Oh, yes.

20:17.175 --> 20:19.594
Finally, an end
to the bureaucratic nightmare.

20:27.102 --> 20:29.354
No more graft. No more payoffs.

20:29.771 --> 20:31.398
No more jury duty!

20:37.862 --> 20:39.322
Wonder what he's so happy about.
