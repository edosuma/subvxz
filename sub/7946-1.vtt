Hey, Bertram,

03:48.210 --> 03:49.334
have you seen Jessie?

03:49.375 --> 03:50.855
Well, I try not to see

03:50.856 --> 03:52.334
any of you.

03:52.375 --> 03:53.438
But I did hear her

03:53.439 --> 03:54.500
babbling something

03:54.542 --> 03:56.334
- about going
- to talk to Brooks.

03:56.375 --> 03:57.626
How? He's in Africa.

03:57.667 --> 03:58.939
Who knows?

03:58.940 --> 04:00.209
She just told me

03:57.667 --> 04:00.209
to look after you all,

04:00.250 --> 04:01.397
so, if you run

04:01.398 --> 04:02.542
with the scissors,

04:02.584 --> 04:04.125
- try not
- to use my good ones.

04:06.209 --> 04:07.542
Ha! Joke's on him.

04:07.584 --> 04:08.834
I use those to clip

04:08.835 --> 04:10.083
my toenails.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.313
There was enough

04:11.314 --> 04:12.500
toe jam to fill

04:10.125 --> 04:12.500
a jelly jar.

04:14.584 --> 04:17.709
Okay, this is strange.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.522
Jessie becomes

04:19.523 --> 04:21.291
unhinged after receiving

04:17.750 --> 04:21.291
Brooks' email.

04:21.334 --> 04:23.043
Then, upon viewing

04:23.044 --> 04:24.751
his website, she decides

04:21.334 --> 04:24.751
she needs to talk to him?

04:24.792 --> 04:26.084
So she leaves,

04:26.085 --> 04:27.375
and tells Bertram

04:24.792 --> 04:27.375
to take care of us.

04:27.417 --> 04:28.439
Which means, Jessie has

04:28.440 --> 04:29.459
gone to Africa because

04:29.500 --> 04:30.605
she's still in love

04:30.606 --> 04:31.709
with that loser Brooks!

04:31.751 --> 04:33.626
But why would she do that?

04:33.667 --> 04:34.918
She's got so much

04:34.919 --> 04:36.167
going on in New York!

04:36.209 --> 04:38.126
Like her acting career,

04:38.127 --> 04:40.042
her dating life...

04:42.209 --> 04:43.355
OMG, she's never

04:43.356 --> 04:44.500
coming back!

05:18.044 --> 05:19.292

- to talk to Brooks.

05:20.918 --> 05:23.500
I have his number.

05:23.542 --> 05:24.542
That's why I dropped

05:24.543 --> 05:25.543
it off to get fixed!

06:14.751 --> 06:16.602

- I stopped keeping tabs - On her

06:16.626 --> 06:17.959
When she said,

06:17.960 --> 06:19.292
"I don't," instead of,

06:16.626 --> 06:19.292
"I do."

06:19.334 --> 06:21.000
- She must not
- be here yet.

06:27.584 --> 06:30.375
What?

06:30.417 --> 06:31.647
I know. Personally,

06:31.648 --> 06:32.876
I don't see it.

06:32.918 --> 06:34.542
- I mean, you have
- the bone structure,

06:34.584 --> 06:35.897
But you don't have

06:35.898 --> 06:37.209

06:34.584 --> 06:37.209
it up. So...

Brooks! The fence on

06:40.419 --> 06:42.042
the rhino enclosure broke!

06:42.083 --> 06:43.418
You have to fix it

06:44.792 --> 06:45.959

06:45.960 --> 06:47.125
to cuddle with

06:44.792 --> 06:47.125

06:47.167 --> 06:49.125

07:11.626 --> 07:13.542
I'll go fix the fence.

- A tour?

07:15.584 --> 07:16.626
On the way,

07:32.334 --> 07:33.688
Ooh! A baby!

07:33.689 --> 07:35.042
Can I hold it?

07:35.083 --> 07:36.459
Well, you can try,

07:36.460 --> 07:37.834
but it'll be about

07:35.083 --> 07:37.834
six feet long,

07:37.876 --> 07:39.084
slimy, and smell like

07:39.085 --> 07:40.292
the inside of a giraffe.

07:40.334 --> 07:42.042
Stink doesn't bother me.

07:42.083 --> 07:43.522
I just took

07:43.523 --> 07:44.959
an 18 hour flight

07:42.083 --> 07:44.959
sitting next to Luke.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.147
All I can smell

07:46.148 --> 07:47.292
is my nose hairs burning.

07:53.083 --> 07:54.751
So tell us,

07:54.752 --> 07:56.417
are you going

07:53.083 --> 07:56.417
to steal Jessie back or not?

07:56.459 --> 07:57.709
Of course not!

07:57.710 --> 07:58.959
It's over between us.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.314
It is?

08:00.315 --> 08:01.626
Well, that was easy.

08:01.667 --> 08:03.314
Take us back to the jet.

08:03.315 --> 08:04.959
They have macadamia nuts!

08:05.000 --> 08:06.334
Hey! I smell French fries.

08:06.335 --> 08:07.667
Can we stop

08:05.000 --> 08:07.667
at a drive-through?

08:07.709 --> 08:09.685
- Ooh, the only fast food - around here
- Is whatever's

08:09.709 --> 08:11.667
- Running away from
- the cheetahs.

08:11.709 --> 08:13.667
- The smell is coming
- from the truck.

08:13.709 --> 08:15.376
Ah, so the engine

08:15.377 --> 08:17.042
must run on bio-fuel.

08:17.083 --> 08:18.313
Oh, that means you put

08:18.314 --> 08:19.542
organic matter

08:17.083 --> 08:19.542
into the engine

08:19.584 --> 08:21.334
- and it converts
- it into energy.

08:21.375 --> 08:22.875
Ah, ah, ah.

08:22.876 --> 08:24.375
That sounds suspiciously

08:21.375 --> 08:24.375

08:40.583 --> 08:42.231
Why didn't you tell me

08:42.232 --> 08:43.876
to back up?

08:43.918 --> 08:45.709
- You said you wanted
- a closer look.

08:45.751 --> 08:47.876
And I got it.

08:45.751 --> 08:50.000
having children.

Oh, Zuri, thank goodness

It's 110 degrees!

09:05.627 --> 09:07.542
Next time, run away

09:03.709 --> 09:07.542
to Antarctica!

09:08.876 --> 09:10.126
Yeah, or here's an idea,

09:10.127 --> 09:11.375
don't run away at all!

from all of this.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.792
never recover.

If I don't get some fluids

09:58.940 --> 10:01.042

- take us there

back into the truck.

14:24.876 --> 14:26.792
- A-ha! You called
- me "sweetheart."

14:26.834 --> 14:28.042
You do still love me!

14:28.083 --> 14:29.501
I was talking to Kami!

14:29.502 --> 14:30.918
She's my girlfriend!

14:33.125 --> 14:34.626
Awkward.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.584
Fun fact.

14:37.626 --> 14:39.459
This is the farthest

14:39.460 --> 14:41.292
I've ever traveled

14:37.626 --> 14:41.292
to be humiliated.

14:44.292 --> 14:45.668
Wait, so,

14:45.669 --> 14:47.042
Kami is your girlfriend?

14:47.083 --> 14:48.209
How could you move on

14:48.210 --> 14:49.334
so soon after

14:47.083 --> 14:49.334
our wedding?

14:49.375 --> 14:50.564
You moved on

14:50.565 --> 14:51.751
during our wedding.

14:51.792 --> 14:53.351
- Then why did you
- send me that love note?

14:53.375 --> 14:55.042
- You mean my email
- that said,

14:55.083 --> 14:56.334
- "Hope all is well
- with you"?

14:56.375 --> 14:57.417
I read between the lines.

14:57.459 --> 14:59.083
It was only one line!

14:59.125 --> 15:00.918
Told ya.

15:00.959 --> 15:02.918
- And I sent the same
- email to 100 people.

15:02.959 --> 15:04.189
Yeah, yeah. Let's just

15:04.190 --> 15:05.417
move on past that.

15:05.459 --> 15:07.083
(LION ROARS)

15:07.125 --> 15:08.959
- Speaking of moving,
- can we do that?

15:09.000 --> 15:10.101
- Because I do not
- want to become

15:10.125 --> 15:11.230
A giant cat toy

15:11.231 --> 15:12.334
for a giant cat!

15:12.375 --> 15:13.834
Unless you have a way

15:13.835 --> 15:15.292
to replace the fuel,

15:12.375 --> 15:15.292
we're stuck here.

15:15.334 --> 15:16.584
What we need is some

15:16.585 --> 15:17.834
organic matter,

15:17.876 --> 15:19.375
i.e. animal excrement,

15:19.417 --> 15:20.876
- which can then
- be converted

15:20.918 --> 15:22.147
Into combustible material

15:22.148 --> 15:23.375
for propulsion.

15:23.417 --> 15:25.917
Sports and Mila Kunis!

15:25.918 --> 15:28.417
What is not clear

15:23.417 --> 15:28.417
about that?

15:28.459 --> 15:29.792
Ravi's right!

15:29.793 --> 15:31.125
Maybe I can modify

15:28.459 --> 15:31.125
the engine to turn

15:31.167 --> 15:32.167
animal waste

15:32.168 --> 15:33.168
into energy.

15:33.209 --> 15:34.251
So, in other words,

15:34.252 --> 15:35.292
you're gonna make

15:33.209 --> 15:35.292
this truck poop-powered.

15:35.334 --> 15:36.688
Oh, I get it.

15:36.689 --> 15:38.042
Like the time I stood

15:35.334 --> 15:38.042
on my skateboard,

15:38.083 --> 15:40.042
- and made it move
- by farting.

15:40.083 --> 15:41.209
No, nothing like that.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.418
I say we offer Luke

15:43.419 --> 15:44.459
to the lions

15:44.500 --> 15:47.125
and make a run for it.

15:47.167 --> 15:49.048
- Bertram, you and the kids
- stay in the truck.

15:49.083 --> 15:50.751
- We'll go scoop up
- some poop.

15:50.792 --> 15:51.835
Kami, as a vet,

15:51.836 --> 15:52.876
I'm sure you're used

15:50.792 --> 15:52.876
to that.

15:52.918 --> 15:54.480
And as a nanny,

15:54.481 --> 15:56.042
I'm sure you are, too.

15:56.083 --> 15:57.480
Hey! I'm 11!

15:57.481 --> 15:58.876
She's 11!

16:04.083 --> 16:06.167
Ugh!

16:06.209 --> 16:07.313
You know, you could have

16:07.314 --> 16:08.417
warned me you had

16:06.209 --> 16:08.417
a girlfriend.

16:08.459 --> 16:10.310
- You could have warned - me
you were coming - To visit.

16:10.334 --> 16:12.042
I didn't come to visit!

16:12.083 --> 16:13.083
I came to get the kids.

16:15.083 --> 16:17.059
- And to think - I was worried,
- You were devastated.

16:17.083 --> 16:19.042
Well, I'm not.

16:19.083 --> 16:20.459
Yeah. Yeah,

16:20.460 --> 16:21.834
we've established that, so...

16:21.876 --> 16:22.876
Yeah.

16:24.542 --> 16:26.292
- You know what?
- This stinks!

16:26.334 --> 16:28.042
- I know. I'm sorry.
- I didn't want you

16:28.083 --> 16:29.185
- To find out about Kami
- this way.

16:29.209 --> 16:30.272
No, no, no, no.

21:07.083 --> 21:08.542
- ALL: Don't tell

21:09.918 --> 21:11.167
Very good.

21:11.209 --> 21:13.125
- Wait a minute,
- something's missing!

21:13.167 --> 21:14.417

21:15.667 --> 21:16.667
My bearded vulture

21:16.668 --> 21:17.668

21:19.334 --> 21:21.584

This is my new

21:22.627 --> 21:23.627

21:26.125 --> 21:28.125
the Rhino.

21:28.167 --> 21:29.271

21:33.459 --> 21:35.417

21:35.459 --> 21:37.250

21:38.626 --> 21:39.626
