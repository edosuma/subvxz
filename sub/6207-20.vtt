31:55.488 --> 31:59.538
- Oh, God, Crowley.
- Was that a hell hound?

32:00.059 --> 32:04.289
- I'd say, yeah.
- Why was that a hell hound?

32:04.597 --> 32:07.799
- What's that?
- Remember my little tracking device?

32:07.800 --> 32:11.030
- Yeah?
- Demons planted one on me.

32:11.137 --> 32:13.370
You're saying
a hell hound followed you?

32:13.371 --> 32:15.005
Technically, he followed this.

32:15.006 --> 32:16.807
Get me out, I'll tell you anything.

32:16.808 --> 32:18.876
- Shut up.
- Okay, then we should go.

32:18.877 --> 32:21.512
Sorry, no one knows more
about the hounds than I.

32:21.513 --> 32:24.603

- I told you.

32:30.088 --> 32:32.056
Well, good for you.

32:32.057 --> 32:36.527
- Luckily we have salt in the kitchen.
- I'll watch Brady.

32:36.528 --> 32:38.395
Watch me?

32:38.396 --> 32:41.524

33:37.855 --> 33:40.290
Stay.

33:40.291 --> 33:43.891
- You can control them?
- Not that one.

33:45.596 --> 33:47.664
I brought my own.

You got no reason to lie, have you?

No, they don't, Dean.

You see, Brady,
we're the ones you should be afraid of.

I bet this is a real moment for you,
big boy.

You're the one who trusted us.
You're the one who let us into your life.

over and over and over again.

Ever wonder why that is, Sammy?

36:29.257 --> 36:33.561
Ever wonder why
we were so in your blind spot?

36:33.562 --> 36:38.265
Maybe it's because we got
the same stuff in our veins.

36:38.266 --> 36:42.416
And deep down,
you know you're just like us.

[BRADY GRUNTING]

- In the flesh.

you crap margaritas.

That's a mite unfriendly.

39:09.615 --> 39:13.985
Seeing as I could be getting you
Death's location in the time you reload.

39:13.986 --> 39:18.055
You're just gonna chat some demons up
and hope they don't recognize you?

39:18.056 --> 39:20.391
God, no. That could get me killed.
