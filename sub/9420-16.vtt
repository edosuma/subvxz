When she was sydney, she had a

06:39.900 --> 06:41.967
Twin brother.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.902
And i had gotten very close to

06:43.904 --> 06:44.903
This twin brother.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.204
He would intentionally tell me

06:46.206 --> 06:47.439
Stuff just to hurt me.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.540
Like, "you'll never be able to

06:48.542 --> 06:49.374
Compete with sydney's

06:49.376 --> 06:50.409
Ex-girlfriend.

06:50.411 --> 06:51.343
She's always going to have her

06:51.345 --> 06:52.277
Heart.

06:52.279 --> 06:53.145
They're in the room together

06:53.147 --> 06:53.979
Right now."

06:53.981 --> 06:55.280
Or, "they did something last

06:55.282 --> 06:56.214
Night."

06:56.216 --> 06:57.048
Or...

06:57.050 --> 06:58.850
>> so sydney's twin brother

06:58.852 --> 06:59.785
Would message you a lot.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.086
>> it's like abuse.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.721
>> yeah, to, like, rile you up

07:02.723 --> 07:03.755
And get you jealous and make you

07:03.757 --> 07:04.589
Feel bad.

07:04.591 --> 07:05.991
>> yeah, i was harassed by

07:05.993 --> 07:07.559
People that she was allegedly

07:07.561 --> 07:09.027
Dating online.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.595
They would post pictures of me

07:10.597 --> 07:12.631
On her page and say these mean

07:12.633 --> 07:13.565
Comments.

07:13.567 --> 07:14.599
And she always stood up for me,

07:14.601 --> 07:16.568
But i felt like she did that so

07:16.570 --> 07:17.736
I would be like, oh, my god, you

07:17.738 --> 07:18.770
Know, thank you for standing up

07:18.772 --> 07:19.638
For me.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.572
>> yeah, but meanwhile you're

07:20.574 --> 07:21.840
Seeing all these hurtful things

07:21.842 --> 07:22.941
That people are saying about

07:22.943 --> 07:23.775
You.

07:23.777 --> 07:24.743
>> yeah, exactly.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.077
>> what were some of the other

07:26.079 --> 07:27.479
Moments or stories or crazy

07:27.481 --> 07:28.447
Things that have happened?

07:28.449 --> 07:29.381
>> she said she was getting

07:29.383 --> 07:31.216
Surgery, removing a small tumor.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.717
And it was the same day as

07:32.719 --> 07:33.752
Midterms.

07:33.754 --> 07:34.986
And i had to make a choice: Do

07:34.988 --> 07:37.889
I either want to go to school

07:37.891 --> 07:40.459
And take midterms or go be with

07:40.461 --> 07:41.393
Her at the hospital?

07:41.395 --> 07:42.427
>> wow.

07:42.429 --> 07:43.528
Did she say, "i want you to be

07:43.530 --> 07:44.596
Here with me"? Like...

07:44.598 --> 07:45.597
>> mm-hmm.

07:45.599 --> 07:46.431
>> she did say that?

07:46.433 --> 07:47.799
>> mm-hmm.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.868
I called every hospital in l.A.,

07:49.870 --> 07:51.636
Pretty much, and gave them a

07:51.638 --> 07:52.537
Name.

07:52.539 --> 07:54.005
They didn't have any record of

07:54.007 --> 07:54.906
Anybody with that name.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.074
>> that's messed up.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.709
>> yeah.

07:57.711 --> 07:58.610
If you don't take midterms, you

07:58.612 --> 07:59.911
Know, you can't really pass the

07:59.913 --> 08:01.179
Class.

08:01.181 --> 08:05.150
So i dropped out.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.618
It ruined a lot.

08:06.620 --> 08:07.719
It ruined a lot.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.054
>> you put your entire future in

08:09.056 --> 08:11.556
Jeopardy for one day.

08:11.558 --> 08:12.357
>> yeah.

08:12.359 --> 08:13.592
>> to meet this girl, because

08:13.594 --> 08:14.526
She said she was having an

08:14.528 --> 08:15.894
Operation.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.929
After that, somehow you guys

08:17.931 --> 08:18.697
Recovered?

08:18.699 --> 08:20.899
>> she knew exactly what to say.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.133
Like, "i don't want you to see

08:22.135 --> 08:23.401
Me like this."

08:23.403 --> 08:24.402
She really had me, like, wrapped

08:24.404 --> 08:25.637
Around her finger.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.138
>> this is sick.

08:27.140 --> 08:27.839
>> mm-hmm.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.741
>> you know, it seems, like,

08:29.743 --> 08:32.977
Actively hurtful.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.013
Let's see her.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.347
>> here's sydney.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.349
>> mm-hmm.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.618
>> so sydney admitted that she

08:39.620 --> 08:40.652
Wasn't sydney.

08:40.654 --> 08:41.586
>> mm-hmm, i'll show you another

08:41.587 --> 08:42.921
Picture.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.422
>> that's whitney?

08:44.424 --> 08:46.858
>> the way she transformed from

08:46.860 --> 08:50.028
Sydney to whitney so--it was so

08:50.030 --> 08:51.796
Smooth the way she did it.

08:51.798 --> 08:53.265
It was like all of a sudden when

08:53.267 --> 08:55.534
She came clean, she already had

08:55.536 --> 08:58.136
An entire, like, family and

08:58.138 --> 09:00.338
Friend base for whitney already

09:00.340 --> 09:01.473
Made up.

09:01.475 --> 09:03.642
>> so you had some suspicions

09:03.644 --> 09:05.110
That whitney was not the girl in

09:05.112 --> 09:06.144
The pictures.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.178
>> definitely.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.079
I actually reached out to that

09:08.081 --> 09:09.047
Girl.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.282
I know that's not her.

09:10.284 --> 09:11.349
>> how'd you find this girl?

09:11.351 --> 09:12.417
>> twitter.

09:12.419 --> 09:13.151
I posted the picture...

09:13.153 --> 09:14.019
>> whoa.

09:14.021 --> 09:14.986
>> of that girl.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.354
Within minutes, people were

09:16.356 --> 09:18.189
Tagging her, like, this is her.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.925
When i went on her twitter, you

09:19.927 --> 09:21.126
Know, everything checked out.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.727
>> why not just let it go?

09:22.729 --> 09:24.062
Why not just walk away?

09:24.064 --> 09:25.797
>> the people that i have dated

09:25.799 --> 09:27.699
After her were horrible.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.100
I kept running back to her.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.702
>> you're being open and honest

09:30.704 --> 09:32.671
And loyal to this girl who, a,

09:32.673 --> 09:33.905
You've never seen...

09:33.907 --> 09:34.573
>> yeah.

09:34.575 --> 09:35.407
>> hasn't given you

09:35.409 --> 09:36.274
Any evidence that she even

09:36.276 --> 09:38.076
Is remotely the person she says.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.411
She's like--she's done nothing

09:39.413 --> 09:40.512
But deceive you,

09:40.514 --> 09:42.814
And yet you still reward her

09:42.816 --> 09:45.383
With your loyalty and affection.

09:45.385 --> 09:46.851
>> if you could press a button

09:46.853 --> 09:48.987
Right now and make

09:48.989 --> 09:51.156
Sydney/whitney kind of disappear

09:51.158 --> 09:52.824
From your life, would you?

09:52.826 --> 09:53.692
>> no.

09:53.694 --> 09:54.359
>> you wouldn't?

09:54.361 --> 09:55.026
>> no.

09:55.028 --> 09:55.794
>> you answered that really

09:55.796 --> 09:56.361
Quickly.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.696
>> i wouldn't.

09:57.698 --> 09:58.830
She's a good person.

09:58.832 --> 09:59.864
>> is she?

09:59.866 --> 10:00.832
>> yeah, even though she's a

10:00.834 --> 10:01.733
Liar.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.234
I feel like i deserve to get to

10:03.236 --> 10:04.069
Know the person that i was in

10:04.071 --> 10:06.871
Love with.

10:06.873 --> 10:07.706
With who they really are,

10:07.708 --> 10:08.807
Though.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.475
>> all right, well, then i guess

10:10.477 --> 10:12.844
Our job is to catch the phantom

10:12.846 --> 10:13.612
Menace.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.413
Hopefully we can help you get

10:15.415 --> 10:16.548
Some answers so that you can get

10:16.550 --> 10:17.816
Some peace of mind.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.217
This is heavy.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.685
>> yeah, this is intense.

10:20.687 --> 10:23.088
>> okay.

10:23.090 --> 10:26.157
All right, thank you.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.393
>> like, this is not just a case

10:28.395 --> 10:29.694
Of, like, well, someone lied to

10:29.696 --> 10:30.695
Me; i'd like to know the truth.

10:30.697 --> 10:32.330
This is like, i have this person

10:32.332 --> 10:33.431
In my life that won't leave me

10:33.433 --> 10:34.099
Alone.

10:34.101 --> 10:34.866
>> right.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.901
>> and she's messed me up so

10:36.903 --> 10:39.037
Much emotionally, if i don't try

10:39.039 --> 10:40.171
To just make peace with them,

10:40.173 --> 10:41.873
I can't even have a relationship

10:41.875 --> 10:42.807
Now.

10:42.809 --> 10:43.675
>> whoever this ends up being,

10:43.677 --> 10:45.176
They're dangerous, and they need

10:45.178 --> 10:47.479
To be cut out of her life.

10:50.516 --> 10:52.550
>> so we got a lot of work to
do, max.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.352
Do, max.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.153
>> we've got to find this
culprit before she does any more

10:56.156 --> 10:58.523
Culprit before she does any more

10:58.524 --> 11:00.891
>> three years ago, ayissha,

11:00.894 --> 11:02.494
She's on twitter, and this girl

11:02.496 --> 11:03.795
She's never heard of, sydney,

11:03.797 --> 11:05.296
Is following her.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.399
They start direct messaging.

11:07.401 --> 11:08.700
Long story short, sydney

11:08.702 --> 11:09.634
Responds, "there's something you

11:09.636 --> 11:10.802
Need to know.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.937
I'm not sydney.

11:12.939 --> 11:13.838
I'm not the girl in the

11:13.840 --> 11:14.506
Pictures.

11:14.508 --> 11:17.175
I'm whitney, and this is me."

11:17.177 --> 11:19.110
Ayissha figures out that whitney

11:19.112 --> 11:20.278
Has a number of different fake

11:20.280 --> 11:21.379
Profiles.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.881
>> and this person's maybe

11:22.883 --> 11:24.149
Stalking her in real life or

11:24.151 --> 11:25.650
Knows, oddly, things that she's

11:25.652 --> 11:27.185
Up to.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.755
>> the lies end now.

11:30.757 --> 11:32.290
Here's the information that i

11:32.292 --> 11:33.358
Have on whitney.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.427
Her name used to be sydney, and

11:35.429 --> 11:36.594
Her twitter/facebook is now

11:36.596 --> 11:37.562
Gone.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.197
The phone number was...

11:39.199 --> 11:40.965
>> 817-[bleep].

11:40.967 --> 11:41.933
>> now her name is

11:41.935 --> 11:43.234
Whitney shanice.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.569
>> all right, so search for

11:44.571 --> 11:45.570
Whitney on facebook.

11:45.572 --> 11:46.671
Look, whitney shanice.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.039
>> so this is whitney's account

11:48.041 --> 11:49.507
Now.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.009
>> whitney has 1,500 friends.

11:51.011 --> 11:51.710
>> right.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.378
>> 66 mutual friends with

11:53.380 --> 11:54.546
Markeith [bleep].

11:54.548 --> 11:57.582
So this guy knows both whitney

11:57.584 --> 11:58.483
And ayissha.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.085
Let's reach out to him.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.454
Dear markeith, we are making an

12:02.456 --> 12:03.855
Episode of <i> catfish</i> and wanted to

12:03.857 --> 12:05.090
Ask you a couple questions

12:05.092 --> 12:06.191
About your friend whitney."

12:06.193 --> 12:06.858
Boom.

12:06.860 --> 12:07.525
>> one down.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.994
Let's see, who's writing on

12:09.996 --> 12:11.496
Whitney's wall?

12:11.498 --> 12:12.464
Eric.

12:12.466 --> 12:13.498
>> they're talking to each

12:13.500 --> 12:14.499
Other.

12:14.501 --> 12:17.168
>> let's send him a message.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.470
Sent.

12:18.472 --> 12:19.637
James scott.

12:19.639 --> 12:20.772
>> "dear james."

12:20.774 --> 12:21.639
Boom.

12:21.641 --> 12:23.908
Go down on whitney's wall.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.243
>> look who's commenting.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.478
Markeith [bleep].

12:26.480 --> 12:27.312
Eric [bleep].

12:27.314 --> 12:28.480
James [bleep].

12:28.482 --> 12:29.647
It's like the same three or four

12:29.649 --> 12:31.950
People on everything.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.218
So that's pretty interesting.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.185
And then look at this.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.654
This whitney profile dates back

12:36.656 --> 12:38.456
To two thousand and, like, ten.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.657
For the first year or two that

12:39.659 --> 12:40.458
She had this profile, she was

12:40.460 --> 12:41.192
Just building it up with

12:41.194 --> 12:41.960
Friends.

12:41.962 --> 12:42.894
She wasn't posting.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.195
She was just friending people.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.598
Whoever's behind this, they've

12:46.600 --> 12:47.799
Been doing it for a long time.

12:47.801 --> 12:48.767
>> we need to pick up on the

12:48.769 --> 12:50.201
Leads that point directly to

12:50.203 --> 12:52.003
Her, like a phone number.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.605
>> we know that someone behind

12:53.607 --> 12:55.473
That phone number is the person

12:55.475 --> 12:56.474
She's talking to, and that's the

Only thing we really have for

Sure.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.444
What about peoplesmart?

12:59.446 --> 13:00.945
Let's just try whitney's phone

Crazy.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.196

13:18.198 --> 13:18.997
She just has a different last

Name.

13:19.900 --> 13:20.965
>> who is this?

13:20.967 --> 13:22.367
>> this is our girl.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.401
>> we're getting close.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.503
We got an address, at least.

13:25.505 --> 13:28.306
She's had multiple fake profiles

13:28.308 --> 13:30.241
Going simultaneously.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.810
The sydney was one.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.378
Whitney shanice was another.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.714
But we do know that the phone

13:36.716 --> 13:37.615
Number...

13:37.617 --> 13:38.483

13:45.158 --> 13:46.925
They're doing, they've had this

13:46.927 --> 13:50.028
Whitney profile up at least for

13:50.030 --> 13:51.930
As long if not longer than the

13:51.932 --> 13:53.031
Sydney profile.

13:53.033 --> 13:53.965
>> right.

13:53.967 --> 13:54.766
Well, we still have a bunch of

13:54.768 --> 13:55.600
People we're waiting to hear

13:55.602 --> 13:56.534
Back from, so we'll come up with

13:56.536 --> 13:57.335
Some kind of a plan for

13:57.337 --> 13:58.102
Tomorrow.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.171
All right.

14:02.208 --> 14:05.677
Max, i got some info.

14:05.679 --> 14:06.377
Oh.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.345
>> oh.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.080
>> while you were sleeping,

14:09.082 --> 14:10.481
I got some text messages.

14:10.483 --> 14:11.482
>> you did?

14:11.484 --> 14:12.283
>> yeah.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.017
Look at this.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.919
I got two new messages from some

14:14.921 --> 14:15.753
Of the guys that we reached out

14:15.755 --> 14:16.387
To.

14:16.389 --> 14:20.091
One says, "this is james.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.693
I don't know who whitney shanice

14:21.695 --> 14:22.861

14:22.863 --> 14:23.962
All right.

14:23.964 --> 14:26.064
Second message: "this is eric.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.299
I don't know who whitney is."

14:28.301 --> 14:29.500
So two of the people that we

14:29.502 --> 14:31.002
Reached out to yesterday saying,

14:31.004 --> 14:31.936
Like, "hey, we'd love to ask you

14:41.982 --> 14:44.482
Real, don't even know her.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.517
So why don't we call ayissha?

>> we were worried that she

15:08.208 --> 15:10.942
Might obviously catch wind of

15:10.944 --> 15:12.377
Us, you know, snooping around.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.479
But what'd you say?

15:18.884 --> 15:19.951
>> why don't we head over there,

15:19.953 --> 15:22.387
And we'll figure all this out?

15:22.389 --> 15:23.688
Whitney knows that we're onto

15:23.690 --> 15:24.589
Her.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.590
She's freaking out.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.624
And she has a bad temper.

17:10.597 --> 17:11.863
She can't be that surprised,

Because she knows she's been

Lying to you for a long time.

Anxious because of this text

17:31.484 --> 17:32.850
Isn't your girlfriend...

>> mm-hmm.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.653
>> has done you a lot of wrong

17:35.655 --> 17:37.855
And kind of brainwashed you into

Thinking that you don't deserve

17:40.460 --> 17:41.759
What you do deserve.

17:41.761 --> 17:42.860
You're kind of caught in this,

17:42.862 --> 17:45.196
Like, really vicious cycle with

17:45.198 --> 17:48.332
This person, and it's messed up.

>> i don't know what it is.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.539
I don't know.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.741
I just...Just that text--just,

17:56.743 --> 17:58.876
It gave me an uneasy feeling.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.545
Did you find anything?

18:00.547 --> 18:01.846
>> we spent all day yesterday

18:01.848 --> 18:03.247
Trying to figure something out

18:03.249 --> 18:04.082
And understand this a little bit

18:04.084 --> 18:05.016
Better.

18:05.018 --> 18:06.484
So we started with going over

18:06.486 --> 18:08.286
Her facebook page...

18:08.288 --> 18:09.387
>> okay.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.189
>> and just sort of reached out

18:11.191 --> 18:12.190
To some of the friends.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.124
>> okay.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.392
>> we sent them just a basic

18:14.394 --> 18:15.259
Message.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.160
"hey, we'd love to talk to you,

18:16.162 --> 18:16.961

18:18.531 --> 18:19.297
>> okay.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.531
>> this morning, i woke up to a

Bunch of text messages.

18:21.601 --> 18:22.567
>> oh.

18:22.569 --> 18:23.367
>> and this is what's

18:23.369 --> 18:24.302
Interesting.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.003
So here's one.

18:26.005 --> 18:27.138
"this is james.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.172
I don't know who whitney shanice

18:28.174 --> 18:29.040
Is."

18:29.042 --> 18:30.174
Okay.

18:30.176 --> 18:31.242
Here's another one.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.276
"this is eric.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.811
I don't know who whitney is."

18:33.813 --> 18:35.580
And here's the one we just got.

18:35.582 --> 18:36.848
"hey, this is markeith.

18:36.850 --> 18:37.615
I have no idea who

18:37.617 --> 18:39.317

18:39.319 --> 18:40.485
They all sent back the exact

18:40.487 --> 18:41.652
Same thing.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.121
>> and we only reached out to

18:43.123 --> 18:44.922
Them because they had left one

18:44.924 --> 18:46.491
Or multiple comments on the

18:46.493 --> 18:47.525
Website.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.093
And not, like, too long ago

18:49.095 --> 18:50.161
Either.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.296
So i'm pretty sure some of the

18:52.298 --> 18:53.598
"friends" that we contacted are

18:53.600 --> 18:55.433
Her.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.135
>> it's pretty weird.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.036
>> this last guy, markeith, you

19:05.244 --> 19:05.910
>> sure.

19:05.912 --> 19:06.644
>> markeith.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.312
>> yeah, markeith has 66 mutual

19:08.314 --> 19:09.914
Friends between you.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.549
>> hmm.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.117
So is he--you guys don't even

19:13.119 --> 19:14.152
Know if he's real.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.186
>> we don't know if he's real.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.555
So this might be how she found

19:17.557 --> 19:18.756
Out what you were doing and when

19:18.758 --> 19:20.224
You were doing it, because she

19:20.226 --> 19:21.726
Friended all your friends.

19:21.728 --> 19:22.727
That's how she's keeping

19:22.729 --> 19:23.794
Tabs on you.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.029
I mean, this is kind of like

19:25.031 --> 19:26.564
Borderline, like, stalking,

19:26.566 --> 19:27.431
Right?

19:27.433 --> 19:28.266
>> i have no idea who she could

19:28.268 --> 19:29.433
Even be.

19:29.435 --> 19:30.701
I don't know what she's

19:30.703 --> 19:31.369
Capable of.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.436
It's creepy.

19:35.974 --> 19:36.841
>> so we just wanted to see what

27:30.950 --> 27:32.049
>> ayissha told us, like, at

27:32.051 --> 27:34.952
Points in your relationship you

27:34.954 --> 27:37.154
Were using other profiles to,

27:37.156 --> 27:39.223
Like, bully her and say nasty

27:39.225 --> 27:40.424
Things about her.

27:40.426 --> 27:41.492
>> they would constantly talk

27:41.494 --> 27:42.960
About me on your facebook.

27:42.962 --> 27:44.228
And it was like you would stand

27:44.230 --> 27:46.296
Up for me, but little did i know

27:46.298 --> 27:48.165
It was you making the comments

27:48.167 --> 27:49.366
In the first place.

27:49.368 --> 27:51.602
>> i guess i wanted to seem like

27:51.604 --> 27:54.104
I'm a good person, like a good

27:54.106 --> 27:56.473
Girlfriend, or whatever, when i

27:56.475 --> 27:58.676
Would make her threaten you.

27:58.678 --> 28:00.210
>> you've really kind of put her

28:00.212 --> 28:01.145
Through hell.

28:01.147 --> 28:02.446
>> i understand that i did

28:02.448 --> 28:03.447
Wrong.

28:03.449 --> 28:04.415
I do.

28:04.417 --> 28:06.116
And i just couldn't--i couldn't

28:06.118 --> 28:07.751
Come out and tell her who i

28:07.753 --> 28:08.519
Really was.

28:08.521 --> 28:09.953
>> right, no, i get that.

28:09.955 --> 28:12.022
I understand how it can be tough

28:12.024 --> 28:13.090
To tell someone the truth.

28:13.092 --> 28:14.591
But, like, you can be lying to

28:14.593 --> 28:16.160
Someone and be nice them, or you

28:16.162 --> 28:17.094
Can be lying to someone and be

28:17.096 --> 28:17.961
Not nice.

28:17.963 --> 28:19.196
And i feel like in a lot of

28:19.198 --> 28:20.631
Cases for a big part of the

28:20.633 --> 28:23.367
Relationship, you were choosing

28:23.369 --> 28:24.601
To kind of do things and say

28:24.603 --> 28:26.370
Things to her that, like, made

28:26.372 --> 28:29.006
Life really tough for her.

28:29.008 --> 28:31.108
>> i don't--i don't know what

28:31.110 --> 28:32.276
You mean by that.

28:32.278 --> 28:33.844
>> well, like for example, she

28:33.846 --> 28:35.512
Told us how there was a day

28:35.514 --> 28:36.580
Where you were supposed to be in

28:36.582 --> 28:38.782
The hospital getting surgery,

28:38.784 --> 28:40.584
And she drove around all day

28:40.586 --> 28:42.119
Looking for you, but you weren't

28:42.121 --> 28:43.721
Actually in that hospital.

28:43.723 --> 28:46.423
>> i mean, i had told her things

28:46.425 --> 28:48.559
That weren't true, but i don't

28:48.561 --> 28:49.793
Remember the hospital thing

28:49.795 --> 28:50.961
Exactly.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.029
But, i mean...

28:52.031 --> 28:52.930
>> oh, my god, i don't know how

28:52.932 --> 28:54.598
To deal with this.

28:54.600 --> 28:55.666
She's a [bleep] liar.

28:55.668 --> 28:58.168
Like, she's lying.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.204
She's lying.

29:00.206 --> 29:01.238
Like, she doesn't remember the

29:01.240 --> 29:02.172
Hospital thing?

29:02.174 --> 29:03.073
>> i know, it was a huge thing.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.142
>> like, she's lying.

29:07.479 --> 29:08.278
>> i just don't remember.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.380
I mean, i--i--i told her a lot

29:10.382 --> 29:11.515
Of things.

29:11.517 --> 29:12.583
I have lied to her a lot,

29:12.585 --> 29:13.717
I have.

29:13.719 --> 29:14.551
>> right.

29:14.553 --> 29:15.486
>> whenever she wanted to see

29:15.488 --> 29:16.854
Me, i would have to make up

29:16.856 --> 29:17.888
Something.

29:17.890 --> 29:18.822
>> but that's a pretty big one.

29:18.824 --> 29:20.324
Like, you were getting some

29:20.326 --> 29:21.492
Surgery, or something like

29:21.494 --> 29:23.127
Cancer or a tumor removed.

29:23.129 --> 29:24.161
She was supposed to be taking

29:24.163 --> 29:25.162
Finals.

29:25.164 --> 29:26.263
I'm only getting one side of the

29:26.265 --> 29:27.331
Story, but i'm inclined to

29:27.333 --> 29:29.133
Believe her over you just

29:29.135 --> 29:30.801
Because of the fact that i know

29:30.803 --> 29:32.302
That you've been lying in a big

29:32.304 --> 29:33.270
Way.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.271
>> i understand.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.139
>> talking about, "i don't

29:35.141 --> 29:36.073
Remember the hospital thing."

29:36.075 --> 29:38.809
Like, oh now you don't remember?

29:38.811 --> 29:39.943
That's bull[bleep] to me.

29:39.945 --> 29:41.078
Like, you're lying.

29:41.080 --> 29:41.912
You're really sitting there

29:41.914 --> 29:42.813
Lying.

29:42.815 --> 29:45.315
>> well, try to get the answers

29:45.317 --> 29:47.785
And hold her feet to the fire.

29:47.787 --> 29:49.486
>> just say whatever you feel

29:49.488 --> 29:50.687
Like saying.

29:50.689 --> 29:51.688
>> i--honestly, it sucks,

29:51.690 --> 29:52.756
Because it's like something that

29:52.758 --> 29:54.725
You don't remember, i remember

29:54.727 --> 29:56.360
Because it affected me so bad.

29:56.362 --> 29:57.661
That's not fair.

29:57.663 --> 29:59.029
>> that's the scary part, that

29:59.031 --> 30:00.564
This is something that you just

30:00.566 --> 30:02.266
Did, and you don't--it was just

30:02.268 --> 30:03.600
A thing that you said.

30:03.602 --> 30:04.601
You don't even remember doing

30:04.603 --> 30:05.536
It.

30:05.538 --> 30:07.171
It drove her crazy.

30:07.173 --> 30:09.373
>> it's like you can't do people

30:09.375 --> 30:10.340
Like that.

30:10.342 --> 30:11.375
Like, that's not fair to me.

30:11.377 --> 30:12.943
You really screwed up a big

30:12.945 --> 30:14.945
Chunk of my life.

30:14.947 --> 30:16.480
>> so you don't still have any

30:16.482 --> 30:18.549
Feelings towards ayissha?

30:18.551 --> 30:21.718
>> i mean, i do--i do.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.858
I really do.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.526
I didn't mean to hurt you the

30:29.528 --> 30:31.195
Way that i did.

30:31.197 --> 30:33.297
There was just a lot going on

30:33.299 --> 30:35.232
With me too, and i should have

30:35.234 --> 30:36.733
Noticed that a long time ago and

30:36.735 --> 30:39.837
Fixed it, but i couldn't.

30:39.839 --> 30:40.971
>> well, what's going on with

30:40.973 --> 30:42.139
You?

30:42.141 --> 30:45.142
>> when i tried to come out,

30:45.144 --> 30:48.312
People weren't so accepting.

30:48.314 --> 30:51.114
I didn't know anybody out here

30:51.116 --> 30:53.884
Like that so, you know, it was

30:53.886 --> 30:54.852
Really hard for me.

30:54.854 --> 30:56.453
I couldn't talk to anybody else.

30:56.455 --> 30:59.056
They tried to beat it out of me,

30:59.058 --> 31:00.324
All kind of stuff.

31:00.326 --> 31:02.759
So i couldn't take...So i...

31:02.761 --> 31:05.829
[sighs]

31:05.831 --> 31:07.898
I ended up going to the internet

31:07.900 --> 31:09.800
For, like, acceptance just to

31:09.802 --> 31:11.935
Make friends, at least to find

31:11.937 --> 31:13.270
Somebody to talk to.

31:13.272 --> 31:16.106
And at the end of the day, i

31:16.108 --> 31:18.375
Ended up finding it.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.010
It was just really hard for me

31:20.012 --> 31:21.044
For a while.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.914
I'm 26 now.

31:23.916 --> 31:26.884
It took a while for me to even

31:26.886 --> 31:28.085
Accept myself.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.020
So that's why i wasn't able to

31:30.022 --> 31:32.256
Come out to her, because i

31:32.258 --> 31:34.358
Couldn't accept myself.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.627
It was really hard for me.

31:40.031 --> 31:41.899
I came out here to apologize to

31:41.901 --> 31:43.567
Ayissha, because i know i did

31:43.569 --> 31:45.636
Her wrong.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.206
>> you came out here all the way

31:49.208 --> 31:50.741
And you're--you know, you're

31:50.743 --> 31:52.442
Letting us film you.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.378
And that's all great, and it's

31:54.380 --> 31:55.479
Appreciated.

31:55.481 --> 31:57.314
But i don't think what you've

31:57.316 --> 31:58.649
Realized is that during this

31:58.651 --> 32:00.317
Whole thing, that while you were

32:00.319 --> 32:03.153
So wrapped up in the tough time

32:03.155 --> 32:04.454
That you were going through,

32:04.456 --> 32:05.656
However you felt like you needed

32:05.658 --> 32:06.890
To act out in order to take care

32:06.892 --> 32:08.659
Of yourself, that you were

32:08.661 --> 32:11.595
Passing a lot of negativity onto

32:11.597 --> 32:13.997
A lot of the other people you

32:13.999 --> 32:15.165
Were talking to, because you

32:15.167 --> 32:18.135
Were just so blind to it, when

32:18.137 --> 32:19.503
She did nothing but care for

32:19.505 --> 32:21.805
You.

32:21.807 --> 32:23.407
>> i just want you to know how

32:23.409 --> 32:24.975
Bad you hurt me, and i just want

32:24.977 --> 32:26.777
You to think about what you

32:26.779 --> 32:27.744
Should be sorry for before you

32:27.746 --> 32:28.879
Tell me you're sorry.

32:28.881 --> 32:30.480
>> look, we're here and it's

32:30.482 --> 32:32.115
Definitely hard sometimes to

32:32.117 --> 32:33.483
Express yourself and show who

32:33.485 --> 32:34.484
You really are.

32:34.486 --> 32:35.886
So we'd like to give you a

32:35.888 --> 32:39.022
Chance to do that more.

32:39.024 --> 32:40.824
Maybe tomorrow we can get back

32:40.826 --> 32:41.959
Together.

32:41.961 --> 32:42.993
>> that's fine.

32:42.995 --> 32:45.295
>> okay.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.731
All right, we'll see you later.

32:50.501 --> 32:51.401
You all right?

32:51.403 --> 32:53.470
>> mm-hmm.

32:55.406 --> 32:57.307
That was horrible.

32:57.309 --> 32:58.542
>> no, you could see something

32:58.544 --> 33:00.677
Changed in just her attitude,

33:00.679 --> 33:01.845
And the way she was holding

33:01.847 --> 33:02.980
Herself when you said that stuff

33:02.982 --> 33:04.014
Just now.

33:04.016 --> 33:05.148
>> this is a damaged person.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.316
>> mm-hmm.

33:06.318 --> 33:07.384
>> and that makes them kind of

33:07.386 --> 33:08.785
Dangerous to other people,

33:08.787 --> 33:09.953
Because they can't see other

33:09.955 --> 33:11.588
People as real.

All right, let's do it.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.310
Why don't you have a seat here.

35:13.312 --> 35:15.078
All right.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.146
How you doing?

35:16.148 --> 35:19.449
>> i'm fine.

35:19.451 --> 35:22.285
>> so, i think it's great that

35:22.287 --> 35:23.386
We can all sit down together and

35:23.388 --> 35:25.655
Have a civil conversation.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.190
>> what led you to create these

35:27.192 --> 35:28.525
Fake profiles, and how old were

35:28.527 --> 35:29.659
You?

35:29.661 --> 35:33.797
>> okay, um, my sophomore year.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.699
I've gotten thrown, kicked,

35:35.701 --> 35:37.067
Punched.

35:37.069 --> 35:38.335
I've gotten dragged.

35:38.337 --> 35:39.936
They would pressure me to date

35:39.938 --> 35:41.972
Guys, but that's not who i was.

35:41.974 --> 35:44.374
Then i started making the fake

35:44.376 --> 35:45.742
Profiles, trying to figure out

35:45.744 --> 35:47.644
Who i wanted to be.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.112
I guess i was trying out

35:49.114 --> 35:51.448
Different people to be.

35:51.450 --> 35:53.016
I ended up being whitney

35:53.018 --> 35:53.950
Shanice.

35:53.952 --> 35:55.552
That was the last one.

35:55.554 --> 35:59.289
>> i see why you did what you

35:59.291 --> 36:00.457
Did.

36:00.459 --> 36:03.960
But, like, why me?

36:03.962 --> 36:06.796
>> i just....When me and you

36:06.798 --> 36:08.598
First started talking, i just

36:08.600 --> 36:10.267
Instantly felt a connection with

36:10.269 --> 36:11.268
You.

36:11.270 --> 36:12.435
I don't know what it was.

36:12.437 --> 36:14.070
But you started talking to me,

36:14.072 --> 36:16.640
So i was like maybe, you know,

36:16.642 --> 36:17.941
She's different from the rest of

36:17.943 --> 36:19.809
These girls, you know?

36:19.811 --> 36:21.044
I felt like you were different

36:21.046 --> 36:22.479
From the jump.

36:22.481 --> 36:24.347
>> i just still don't understand

36:24.349 --> 36:26.716
Why you would build me up just

36:26.718 --> 36:27.951
To tear me down.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.653
>> me being mean to you through

36:29.655 --> 36:31.755
Different profiles and stuff

36:31.757 --> 36:33.390
Like that, i can admit that i

36:33.392 --> 36:35.025
Was jealous that you were, you

36:35.027 --> 36:36.293
Know, out.

36:36.295 --> 36:37.994
You were out, and everybody

36:37.996 --> 36:39.729
Loved you, you know?

36:39.731 --> 36:41.765
And i couldn't be that person.

36:41.767 --> 36:42.799
I couldn't be who i wanted to

36:42.801 --> 36:43.733
Be.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.569
But it was still hard for me to

36:45.571 --> 36:48.138
Tell you, just because you were

36:48.140 --> 36:49.906
Somebody that was real special

36:49.908 --> 36:51.474
To me, because you actually

36:51.476 --> 36:54.311
Loved me, but i never had that

36:54.313 --> 36:56.413
Type of love from anybody.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.215
But you came along and you

36:58.217 --> 36:59.616
Showed me the love that i've

36:59.618 --> 37:02.219
Never had, ever in my life.

37:02.221 --> 37:03.887
>> you didn't want to lose

37:03.889 --> 37:04.821
Ayissha.

37:04.823 --> 37:06.423
You didn't want to walk away

37:06.425 --> 37:07.457
From that relationship.

37:07.459 --> 37:08.325
But you knew you had sort of

37:08.327 --> 37:09.259
Screwed it up.

37:09.261 --> 37:11.761
>> she was always there, and it

37:11.763 --> 37:12.929
Made me feel good that she

37:12.931 --> 37:15.432
Actually cared.

37:15.434 --> 37:17.500
[sniffles]

37:24.475 --> 37:26.142
[sighs]

37:26.144 --> 37:27.143
That's why i couldn't let you

37:27.145 --> 37:29.279
Go.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.483
I do apologize for it.

37:35.486 --> 37:37.554
>> i accept your apology,

37:37.556 --> 37:38.722
Because now i do feel like it is

37:38.724 --> 37:40.590
Genuine, and i just hope that

37:40.592 --> 37:42.759
One day you're able to be fully

37:42.761 --> 37:44.594
Confident in yourself, because

37:44.596 --> 37:46.496
You are a great person.

37:46.498 --> 37:48.698
Maybe this will, like, help you

37:48.700 --> 37:52.269
Understand, because i never saw

37:52.271 --> 37:54.237
You when we were dating, and you

37:54.239 --> 37:55.338
Made me happier than any other

37:55.340 --> 37:56.840
Girlfriend has ever made me.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.008
So you did something really

37:58.010 --> 37:58.775
Right.

37:58.777 --> 37:59.709
You did.

37:59.711 --> 38:01.878
So i don't think you should be

38:01.880 --> 38:05.015
Too hard on yourself.

38:05.017 --> 38:06.283
>> now that we've sort of

38:06.285 --> 38:09.919
Unmasked this person and you can

38:09.921 --> 38:14.491
See who she is, it's sort of now

38:14.493 --> 38:16.660
Up to you guys just to figure

38:16.662 --> 38:17.861
Out what's next.

38:17.863 --> 38:20.196
>> now that i can see you, like,

38:20.198 --> 38:22.032
Face-to-face, you don't have any

38:22.034 --> 38:24.367
Control over me anymore.

38:24.369 --> 38:25.769
And i'm not saying that to be

38:25.771 --> 38:26.836
Harsh or anything.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.204
If you ever need me i'll be

38:28.206 --> 38:29.572
There, but...

38:29.574 --> 38:30.907
>> and vice versa.

38:30.909 --> 38:32.642
If you ever need to talk.

38:32.644 --> 38:35.979
But i'm not going to contact you

38:35.981 --> 38:38.348
Like that anymore, and i'm not

38:38.350 --> 38:39.516
Going to be on your phone like

38:39.518 --> 38:40.717
That.

38:40.719 --> 38:42.352
If you want to come to me, you

38:42.354 --> 38:43.687
Can come to me.

38:43.689 --> 38:44.688
>> i feel like we've all grown

38:44.690 --> 38:45.955
Up a little bit this week.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.590
>> a lot.

38:47.592 --> 38:48.625
>> definitely.

38:48.627 --> 38:49.626
>> all right.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.661
Thanks for sharing your story.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.898
That's not easy to do.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.366
Okay.

38:56.368 --> 38:59.102
Thank you.

38:59.104 --> 39:00.970
That was intense, but i thought

39:00.972 --> 39:02.105
That was really amazing that you

39:02.107 --> 39:03.840
Were able to, like, forgive her

39:03.842 --> 39:04.974
And accept her and empathize

39:04.976 --> 39:05.909
With her.

39:05.911 --> 39:06.710
And that's what makes you

39:06.712 --> 39:08.478
Awesome.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.013
>> everyone goes through

39:10.015 --> 39:11.047
Something different.

39:11.049 --> 39:12.949
I can't fault her for anything,

39:12.951 --> 39:15.051
Because i have my own flaws too.

39:18.322 --> 39:19.622
>> hey!

39:19.624 --> 39:20.690
>> whoa!

39:20.692 --> 39:22.025
What's going on?

39:22.027 --> 39:22.892
>> school is taking up pretty

39:22.894 --> 39:23.827
Much, like, all of my time.

39:23.829 --> 39:26.529
>> are you seeing anybody?

39:28.966 --> 39:30.166
>> we're just friends.

39:30.168 --> 39:31.401
>> just friend who do favors for

39:31.403 --> 39:32.335
Each other?

39:32.337 --> 39:33.303
>> no, just friends.

39:33.305 --> 39:34.437
[laughs]

39:34.439 --> 39:36.072
>> have you talked at all to

39:36.074 --> 39:37.006
Whitney?

39:37.008 --> 39:37.974
>> no.

39:37.976 --> 39:38.775
>> zero?

39:38.777 --> 39:40.243
>> i still forgive her, but as

39:40.245 --> 39:42.345
Far as like us ever--kind of

39:42.347 --> 39:43.380
Like a friendship or anything,

39:43.382 --> 39:44.381
I don't think that's possible,

39:44.383 --> 39:45.715
Because i just don't trust her.

39:45.717 --> 39:46.816
>> how do you feel about the

39:46.818 --> 39:48.184
Whole thing, looking back on it?

39:48.186 --> 39:49.452
>> i feel like a weight has been

39:49.454 --> 39:50.420
Lifted off.

39:50.422 --> 39:52.322
Now with relationships, i know

39:52.324 --> 39:53.390
What i deserve.

39:53.392 --> 39:55.625
So i won't settle for less.

39:55.627 --> 39:56.693
>> well, that's great.

39:56.695 --> 39:57.727
We're happy for you.

39:57.729 --> 39:58.762
Good luck with school.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.730
And hopefully we'll talk soon.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.132
>> all right, thank you.

40:02.134 --> 40:04.401
>> bye.

40:04.403 --> 40:05.802
>> both: Hey!

40:05.804 --> 40:07.003
>> how you doing?

40:07.005 --> 40:09.072
>> everything's going good.

40:10.741 --> 40:11.508
>> wow.

40:11.510 --> 40:12.475
>> shipping off.

40:12.477 --> 40:13.376
>> what about your fake

40:13.378 --> 40:14.310
Profiles?

40:14.312 --> 40:15.378
Are you finished with those?

40:15.380 --> 40:17.414
>> yeah, i don't even get on

40:17.416 --> 40:18.782
Anything anymore.

40:18.784 --> 40:20.850
I learned a lot...

40:23.354 --> 40:24.521
...Doesn't mean that you have to

40:24.523 --> 40:25.655
Hurt other people.

40:25.657 --> 40:26.956
>> well, you seem like you're in

40:26.958 --> 40:27.957
A good place.

40:27.959 --> 40:29.025
Have a great summer.

40:29.027 --> 40:30.059
>> all right, you too.

40:30.061 --> 40:31.428
>> both: Bye.
