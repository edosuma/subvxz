00:00.592 --> 00:01.922
My name is Elena Gilbert.

00:01.924 --> 00:04.458
I'm a new vampire, and there
have been complications.

00:04.460 --> 00:06.221
I know that I'm
sired to you, Damon.

00:06.222 --> 00:07.622
You know what would
make me happy?

00:07.624 --> 00:09.707
That what you
actually felt for me was real.

00:09.709 --> 00:11.009
Elena, voice-over:
But there's hope now.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.844
Woman: Jeremy's tattoo
leads to a cure.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.679
Elena, voice-over:
If you kill Klaus's brother Kol,

00:14.681 --> 00:17.215
their entire sire line
will die with them.

00:17.217 --> 00:20.768
I was gonna make him
suffer on my terms!

00:22.638 --> 00:25.473
Man: Unlikely alliances
have formed.

00:25.475 --> 00:27.475
Finding the cure could
come at a price.

00:27.477 --> 00:29.360
Silas is the world's
first immortal being

00:29.362 --> 00:31.429
who just happens
to be imprisoned with the cure.

00:31.431 --> 00:32.980
I want to free him.

00:32.982 --> 00:35.450
Man: We'll be fine when
we have everything we need.

00:35.452 --> 00:36.784
Here we go.

Congratulations.

02:17.803 --> 02:19.003
We made it.

02:44.029 --> 02:45.997
They couldn't have hidden
this cure in Hawaii?

02:45.999 --> 02:47.532
Where the hell
did you take us?

02:47.534 --> 02:49.951
200 miles off the
Nova Scotia mainland.

02:49.953 --> 02:51.836
If you recall, the whole
point was to hide the cure

02:51.838 --> 02:54.205
on the world's most obscure,
desolate island.

02:54.207 --> 02:56.007
Oh, yeah?
I thought the whole point

02:56.009 --> 02:58.209
was that no one
found Silas,

02:58.211 --> 03:01.179
the oldest, deadliest
freak in the world.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.547
Yeah, that too.

03:04.349 --> 03:05.749
Sunscreen?

03:06.718 --> 03:08.752
Is that a joke?

03:08.754 --> 03:10.021
You're right.

03:14.860 --> 03:16.194
Not really helping.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.979
You're perfectly
capable of tying a knot.

03:17.981 --> 03:20.342
Your giving Elena the evil eye--
it's not really helping.

03:20.442 --> 03:21.348
She killed my brother.

03:21.373 --> 03:23.106
I tried to get you to put
a dagger in my back.

03:23.131 --> 03:25.144
She's lucky all she's
getting is the evil eye.

03:25.635 --> 03:27.199
You know I can hear you,
right?

03:27.797 --> 03:29.264
You know I don't care,
right?

03:32.494 --> 03:33.743
Uhh!

03:33.745 --> 03:35.462
Go ahead.
Try and kill me.

03:35.464 --> 03:37.497
But then you'd have
to face your real problems--

03:37.499 --> 03:40.700
like the fact that Stefan
invited me here himself.

03:40.702 --> 03:42.385
I guess he likes
me again.

03:51.812 --> 03:52.979
[Unzips coat]

03:54.765 --> 03:56.316
Looks like
someone forgot

03:56.318 --> 03:58.234
her team-building
exercises.

03:58.236 --> 04:01.521
I'm not apologizing
for not wanting her here.

04:01.523 --> 04:03.022
You know, Stefan
just brought her here

04:03.024 --> 04:04.524
to make it seem like
he's moving on.

04:04.526 --> 04:06.025
He wants you to think
that he's over you

04:06.027 --> 04:07.193
and he wants me to think

04:07.195 --> 04:08.895
that I can't get
under her skin.

04:09.914 --> 04:11.247
You know, you're right.

04:11.249 --> 04:12.832
With any luck,

04:12.834 --> 04:14.951
I'll only have to tolerate
her for a few more days

04:14.953 --> 04:16.067
and then we'll find
the cure and I'll

04:16.070 --> 04:17.587
never have to deal
with her again.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.071
Human Rebekah.

04:19.072 --> 04:20.874
Can't imagine her
without fangs.

04:23.410 --> 04:25.244
You know...

04:25.246 --> 04:26.513
you've never talked about

04:26.515 --> 04:27.747
what you'll do
with the cure

04:27.749 --> 04:29.081
once we find it.

04:30.267 --> 04:31.668
Will you take it?

04:35.022 --> 04:36.723
I don't like
to speculate.

04:40.060 --> 04:42.228
[Beeping]

04:44.231 --> 04:45.932
Sorry. If there was
a less awkward

04:45.934 --> 04:48.267
way to do this,
I would.

04:50.204 --> 04:51.538
Doesn't bother me.

04:53.707 --> 04:55.742
These symbols must
have been left for the hunters

04:55.744 --> 04:57.243
so they could
find the cure,

04:57.245 --> 04:59.946
and this must be
the story of Qetsiyah and Silas.

04:59.948 --> 05:02.832
According to Shane,
Silas asked Qetsiyah

05:02.834 --> 05:05.418
for help making a spell
for immortality.

05:06.787 --> 05:08.454
She helped make him
immortal, only to learn

05:08.456 --> 05:09.789
he planned to use
the same spell on

05:09.791 --> 05:11.674
another woman, not her

05:11.676 --> 05:13.309
when she found out,
she freaked.

05:14.345 --> 05:16.629
So, Qetsiyah killed
the other woman?

05:18.465 --> 05:20.984
Yeah. Silas
was immortal.

05:20.986 --> 05:22.969
She couldn't kill him.

05:22.971 --> 05:24.571
So, she trapped him
in a cave

05:24.573 --> 05:26.606
and buried him
alive instead.

05:34.031 --> 05:36.649
Does it say anything about
the hunter's purpose in all this?

05:36.651 --> 05:38.317
Shane: I was wondering
when you'd ask.

05:40.371 --> 05:42.939
Qetsiyah created
a cure for immortality

05:42.941 --> 05:44.624
and then she
buried it with Silas,

05:44.626 --> 05:45.959
hoping that he'd
take it and die.

05:45.961 --> 05:47.260
End up on the other
side with her

05:47.262 --> 05:48.828
for all eternity.

05:48.830 --> 05:50.797
But he wouldn't
give her the satisfaction.

05:50.799 --> 05:52.432
So, many centuries
later, her descendants

05:52.434 --> 05:54.834
created the hunters to find him,
cure him, and kill him.

05:55.970 --> 05:57.487
You know what?
I'll explain on the hike.

05:57.489 --> 05:59.155
Come on.
We gotta get going.

06:12.653 --> 06:15.204
[Door opens and closes]

06:18.959 --> 06:21.144
Morning, Sunshine.

06:21.146 --> 06:22.779
You look pathetic.

06:22.781 --> 06:26.683
Only until Bonnie's spell
locking me in here wears off.

06:26.685 --> 06:28.718
Then I'll look different.

06:31.388 --> 06:32.972
Angrier, perhaps.

06:32.974 --> 06:34.724
Or, I won't look
like anything,

06:34.726 --> 06:37.310
because I'll have gouged your
eyeballs from their sockets.

06:37.312 --> 06:39.512
My friends will be
back with the cure by then.

06:39.514 --> 06:41.047
So, I could shove it
down your throat

06:41.049 --> 06:42.165
and make you mortal.

06:42.167 --> 06:44.601
I'm an original.

06:44.603 --> 06:46.936
What makes you think
my entire vampire bloodline

06:46.938 --> 06:49.022
won't be cured
along with me?

06:49.024 --> 06:51.691
I.E., you.

06:51.693 --> 06:53.076
You know what I think?

06:55.562 --> 06:57.680
I think
that's impossible.

06:57.682 --> 07:00.366
I think the moment
you stop being a vampire,

07:00.368 --> 07:03.369
our whole blood connection
to you is broken,

07:03.371 --> 07:05.788
and your sire-line
ceases to exist.

07:05.790 --> 07:07.991
So, whatever
happens to you,

07:07.993 --> 07:10.343
happens only to you,

07:10.345 --> 07:11.577
which means I can
kill your ass

07:11.579 --> 07:13.196
and no one else
has to die.

07:13.198 --> 07:17.050
Although I am still debating
just how to do it.

07:17.052 --> 07:18.384
I recommend drowning.

07:18.386 --> 07:20.019
There's nothing quite
like the feeling of

07:20.021 --> 07:22.956
someone fighting for something
as basic as human breath.

07:22.958 --> 07:26.592
And let me tell you,
your mother was a fighter.

07:40.124 --> 07:42.441
[Beeping]

07:42.443 --> 07:44.460
Satellite phone
lost its signal.

07:44.462 --> 07:45.878
Damon: That's a good sign.

07:47.948 --> 07:50.116
Is anyone else
a little creeped out?

07:50.118 --> 07:52.168
So, then leave.
Out of everyone,

07:52.170 --> 07:53.920
your presence is
the least necessary.

07:53.922 --> 07:54.954
Please don't start.

07:54.956 --> 07:56.556
I'm merely stating
the facts.

07:56.558 --> 07:58.391
Jeremy has the spell
on his body.

07:58.393 --> 08:00.343
Bonnie's the witch
that unseals the cure.

08:00.345 --> 08:02.294
Shane is
the human compass.

08:02.296 --> 08:03.346
You and I have
the tombstone,

08:03.348 --> 08:05.064
which does
God knows what.

08:05.066 --> 08:06.733
And Elena has no point.

08:08.135 --> 08:09.152
What about me?

08:09.154 --> 08:10.820
You have a nice behind.

08:19.913 --> 08:21.781
Shane: Centuries after
Qetsiyah died,

08:21.783 --> 08:23.282
there were these miners
who were excavating

08:23.284 --> 08:24.500
a well on the island.

08:24.502 --> 08:25.752
Suddenly went mad.

08:25.754 --> 08:28.287
Bled themselves dry.
No apparent reason.

08:28.289 --> 08:30.590
So, the legend spread
that these miners,

08:30.592 --> 08:33.710
in exchange for
a drop of their blood,

08:33.712 --> 08:35.428
saw visions of their
lost loved ones

08:35.429 --> 08:36.929
in the well
they were digging.

08:38.164 --> 08:41.000
The word traveled
and explorers

08:41.001 --> 08:42.101
sought out the well

08:42.102 --> 08:44.987
to see if
the legend was true.

08:44.989 --> 08:47.607
So, the well
was magic?

08:47.609 --> 08:49.892
Yeah. Some people
believe the voices of lost souls

08:49.894 --> 08:52.895
were just a wind
vortex whipping through caves.

08:52.897 --> 08:54.864
And visions were caused
by inhaling the island's

08:54.866 --> 08:56.199
poisonous plant life.

08:57.117 --> 08:58.701
And what do
you believe?

08:58.703 --> 09:00.119
I believe in magic.

09:01.354 --> 09:03.322
My wife and my son

09:03.324 --> 09:04.891
died within months
of each other.

09:07.961 --> 09:12.632
And so...I decided to try
the well out for myself.

09:17.004 --> 09:18.855
I offered up my blood
and waited.

09:28.548 --> 09:31.484
Hello? Hello?

09:31.486 --> 09:33.069
Woman, whispering:
Atticus?

09:34.271 --> 09:38.207
Caitlin. Caitlin?
Caitlin?

10:00.514 --> 10:02.682
[Indistinct whispering]

10:11.424 --> 10:12.591
Whoa!

10:14.611 --> 10:16.095
Oh!

10:17.114 --> 10:19.282
[Grunting]

10:26.290 --> 10:27.740
Hello, Atty.

10:31.712 --> 10:32.795
Caitlin.

10:32.797 --> 10:34.630
Shane: I saw my wife.

10:34.632 --> 10:37.116
I saw her eyes.

10:37.118 --> 10:38.467
Her smile.

10:40.087 --> 10:41.787
My blood let me
see her again.

10:41.789 --> 10:43.172
Yeah, got it.

10:43.174 --> 10:44.974
Don't eat the
poisonous flowers.

10:51.631 --> 10:54.133
Wait. Stop.
Stop! Stop.

10:56.636 --> 10:58.154
Is everybody
paying attention?

10:59.273 --> 11:01.107
Our first lesson
in survival.

11:07.480 --> 11:10.766
Stay together.
Keep your eyes open.

11:13.871 --> 11:15.154
Jeremy: I want
a water.

11:15.156 --> 11:17.456
Here. Take mine.

11:19.710 --> 11:21.711
Magic well?
Seriously?

11:21.713 --> 11:23.963
I don't know.
I mean...

11:23.965 --> 11:25.765
We've all lost someone.

11:25.767 --> 11:28.334
The chance to maybe
see them again?

11:28.336 --> 11:29.802
I kinda get it.

11:35.943 --> 11:37.693
[Branch snaps]

11:37.695 --> 11:39.028
Elena: Jeremy!

11:41.698 --> 11:43.199
Aah!

11:47.287 --> 11:49.455
What the hell
just happened?

11:49.457 --> 11:51.207
Jeremy: Somebody
just saved my life.

12:04.206 --> 12:05.656
What is this place?

12:05.658 --> 12:07.358
Shane: According to
island lore,

12:07.360 --> 12:09.460
a group of college kids
came here for spring break.

12:10.695 --> 12:12.163
A few weeks later,
they were all found dead,

12:12.165 --> 12:14.332
completely drained
of blood.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.634
Well, tragic for them,
brilliant for us.

12:16.636 --> 12:17.868
Who sleeps where?

12:17.870 --> 12:19.086
Well, that's lovely.

12:19.088 --> 12:20.638
There's a mystery man
with a hatchet

12:20.640 --> 12:21.672
lurking in the woods

12:21.674 --> 12:22.924
and we're just
gonna camp?

12:22.926 --> 12:24.225
Shane: We're safer here
than we are

12:24.227 --> 12:25.510
hiking in the dark.

12:26.712 --> 12:29.480
Let's just keep going.
You know?

12:29.482 --> 12:32.600
Get the cure. Get in, get out.
Where is it?

12:32.602 --> 12:33.851
How stupid do you
think I am?

12:33.853 --> 12:35.553
Stupid enough to raise
an immortal witch,

12:35.555 --> 12:37.855
so I'd say...incredibly.

12:37.857 --> 12:39.173
Yeah, I'm shocked you
even want the cure,

12:39.175 --> 12:40.708
considering you've got
the most to lose

12:40.710 --> 12:42.026
once Elena's human.

12:54.556 --> 12:56.290
Shane doesn't know what
he's talking about.

12:56.292 --> 12:58.409
We'll find out
tomorrow.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.878
Do you really think I'm
gonna take this cure,

13:00.880 --> 13:03.798
break the sire bond,
and fall out of love with you?

13:03.800 --> 13:07.418
No. I'm saying
we don't know.

13:08.387 --> 13:11.188
And if we find it
tomorrow, we will.

13:11.190 --> 13:15.209
This cure is gonna
change so many things.

13:15.211 --> 13:18.029
Jeremy's not gonna want
to kill me anymore.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.697
We're finally gonna
get rid of Klaus.

13:19.699 --> 13:21.399
Bonnie's mom isn't
gonna be a vampire.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.401
And anyone who wants
to take this cure

13:23.403 --> 13:25.753
is gonna have
that option.

13:25.755 --> 13:29.273
Caroline, Stefan,
and you.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.410
If you want it.

13:34.196 --> 13:37.331
I get it.
Everything changes tomorrow.

13:37.333 --> 13:40.334
It'll be all
unicorns and rainbows.

13:40.336 --> 13:43.487
No, not everything.
That's what I'm saying.

13:44.539 --> 13:47.608
Damon, not my feelings
for you.

13:54.883 --> 13:56.300
Mm.

14:10.699 --> 14:13.317
You're still here?
What are you doing?

14:14.286 --> 14:15.453
Gloating.

14:17.005 --> 14:18.456
Hello, Caroline.

14:22.661 --> 14:23.994
Come home.

14:23.996 --> 14:25.663
Don't stoop
to his level.

14:25.665 --> 14:27.782
He destroyed
my life.

14:29.101 --> 14:30.267
I plan on
being present

14:30.269 --> 14:31.719
for every second
of his misery

14:31.721 --> 14:33.421
until I can
kill him myself.

14:35.390 --> 14:37.725
Fine. You can gloat
and multitask.

14:37.727 --> 14:40.645
This place
is a disaster.

14:40.647 --> 14:43.948
Starting with
a horrific burnt corpse.

14:56.411 --> 15:01.666
Tyler's mother is dead.
So is my brother.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.384
We're even.

15:05.871 --> 15:07.805
Call Bonnie

15:07.807 --> 15:10.675
and get her to let me
out of here.

15:10.677 --> 15:13.811
I will never, ever,
help you.

15:13.813 --> 15:15.279
How quickly you
forget the part

15:15.281 --> 15:17.214
where I saved Tyler
from the misery

15:17.216 --> 15:19.350
of being a werewolf.

15:19.352 --> 15:22.820
Or the night your mother
invited me into her home

15:22.822 --> 15:25.356
to save the life of her
precious daughter.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.391
How delusional
are you?

15:27.393 --> 15:29.994
You killed his mother.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.862
And let's not forget
that we're standing in a house

15:31.864 --> 15:34.448
where Elena's Aunt Jenna
used to live.

15:34.450 --> 15:35.783
Or did you think
that your charm

15:35.785 --> 15:37.868
would make us forget
how you killed her, too?

15:37.870 --> 15:41.939
You know what? No.
I am not going to engage in this.

15:41.941 --> 15:45.843
You are not even worth
the calories I burn talking to you.

15:47.612 --> 15:49.547
No!

15:49.549 --> 15:51.048
Uhh!

15:53.385 --> 15:54.685
[Thud]

15:59.191 --> 16:01.925
Now, that was definitely
worth the calories.

16:05.147 --> 16:08.065
Well, 7 of us and no one
thought to bring s'mores.

16:09.201 --> 16:11.736
What are you doing
with that?

16:11.738 --> 16:14.155
We're a day away from
finding the cure.

16:14.157 --> 16:15.906
Not letting it
out of my sight.

16:15.908 --> 16:19.276
[Animal howls]

16:19.278 --> 16:21.212
Do you hear that?

16:21.214 --> 16:23.080
I swear this place
is haunted.

16:23.948 --> 16:26.867
Um...you're
crushing my arm.

16:30.505 --> 16:34.725
Ok. You got me.
I'm a scaredy cat.

16:34.727 --> 16:37.394
You do realize you're an
original vampire, right?

16:37.396 --> 16:40.130
Which is precisely why
you should stop teasing me.

16:40.132 --> 16:41.899
I'm very powerful.

16:44.436 --> 16:46.270
What are you gonna do
when Elena becomes human

16:46.272 --> 16:47.788
and comes running back
to you?

16:49.608 --> 16:54.028
You said that you'd take the cure
to be with her.

16:54.030 --> 16:56.947
You'd have children
and grow old.

16:56.949 --> 16:58.415
Is it still true?

17:00.652 --> 17:03.087
Why do you want
to take it?

17:03.089 --> 17:07.290
Aren't you
the perfect vampire?

17:07.292 --> 17:08.659
Isn't it obvious?

17:09.627 --> 17:13.079
It's all an act, Stefan.

17:13.082 --> 17:15.266
Being a vampire
is miserable.

17:17.502 --> 17:20.671
I would give anything
to be human.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.156
Normal.

17:27.646 --> 17:32.449
If I take the cure...
It wouldn't be for her.

17:33.885 --> 17:35.202
It'd be for me.

17:43.578 --> 17:45.713
I've been staring
at pictures of Jeremy's tattoo

17:45.715 --> 17:47.164
and there's no spell.

17:47.166 --> 17:50.334
Expression doesn't
require a written spell.

17:50.336 --> 17:51.919
Just think of it
as a way of

17:51.921 --> 17:54.255
accessing magic that
already exists inside you.

17:54.257 --> 17:55.806
You just have to
want it bad enough.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.691
And I'm just supposed
to trust you?

17:57.693 --> 18:00.761
Bonnie, listen,
I taught you expression

18:00.763 --> 18:03.414
so that you could
access the cure.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.816
I'll be right there with you
the whole time. Promise.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.718
You didn't answer
the trust part.

18:08.770 --> 18:10.221
All right.
Let me put it this way.

18:10.223 --> 18:13.023
You need me to help
you through it, Bonnie.

18:13.025 --> 18:16.193
And as you've demonstrated,
expression can get messy.

18:16.195 --> 18:18.212
Believe me when I say I've
seen it get a lot worse.

18:18.214 --> 18:20.564
How much worse?

18:20.566 --> 18:22.399
When we lost our son
in the car accident,

18:22.401 --> 18:24.735
my wife kind of lost it.

18:26.538 --> 18:28.873
She tried to resurrect
his body using magic.

18:30.041 --> 18:31.625
Your wife was a witch?

18:31.627 --> 18:33.160
She was
a powerful witch.

18:33.162 --> 18:35.412
And incredibly
undisciplined.

18:35.414 --> 18:36.914
And you never thought
to tell me?

18:36.916 --> 18:39.183
I just didn't want
to scare you.

18:39.185 --> 18:40.384
The truth is, she tried

18:40.386 --> 18:41.969
to bring our son back
using expression,

18:41.971 --> 18:44.972
and it overwhelmed her,
and she died.

18:44.974 --> 18:47.641
You taught me the same
magic that killed your wife?

18:47.643 --> 18:49.009
Yeah, but look,
the upside is,

18:49.011 --> 18:50.744
I've learned the warning
signs, all right?

18:50.746 --> 18:52.813
I can keep expression
from consuming you.

18:52.815 --> 18:54.498
Downside is, you turned
her into a bomb

18:54.500 --> 18:56.317
that only you
can dismantle.

18:56.319 --> 18:58.535
Don't you think I know
how this ends?

18:59.938 --> 19:01.772
I came here
to raise Silas

19:01.774 --> 19:03.607
so that he could
bring back the dead,

19:03.609 --> 19:06.410
but you're never gonna
let that happen.

19:06.412 --> 19:08.862
The second I point
to a cure, you're gonna kill me.

19:11.416 --> 19:13.233
Now Bonnie has to
keep me alive

19:13.235 --> 19:15.235
so that I can
keep her alive.

19:35.807 --> 19:37.074
[Crackling]

19:43.984 --> 19:45.293
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

19:45.393 --> 19:47.097
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

19:47.197 --> 19:49.330
Oh, my God...
Hey. Hey.

19:49.332 --> 19:51.282
Look at me.
Look at me.

19:51.284 --> 19:52.417
I can fix this.

19:52.419 --> 19:54.219
How? The only thing

19:54.221 --> 19:56.337
that can heal me
is his blood.

19:56.339 --> 19:58.556
Oh, my God...
Tyler: I know.

19:59.875 --> 20:01.292
I'll fix it.

20:08.868 --> 20:10.902
She'll die if you
don't heal her.

20:11.837 --> 20:13.137
Ok.

20:19.545 --> 20:22.046
Beg me to save
her life.

20:22.048 --> 20:24.249
Is this what
you want?

20:24.251 --> 20:26.467
To remind me that
I'm powerless against you?

20:26.469 --> 20:30.205
Fine. You win.
I'm nothing.

20:30.207 --> 20:32.524
Now, save her.
Please.

20:32.526 --> 20:35.193
I'm sorry, mate.
I didn't quite catch that.

20:35.195 --> 20:36.761
Please.

20:36.763 --> 20:38.463
Please...

20:40.649 --> 20:43.334
Please save her life.

20:44.470 --> 20:45.570
See, now I think
you're just

20:45.572 --> 20:47.121
telling me what
I want to hear.

20:47.123 --> 20:49.274
I mean, you did call
me pathetic earlier.

20:49.276 --> 20:51.976
And wouldn't it be more
pathetic of me to help now,

20:51.978 --> 20:53.394
knowing that hours
ago, you announced

20:53.396 --> 20:55.179
your plan to kill me
in a manner in which

20:55.181 --> 20:56.614
you're still
debating because

20:56.616 --> 20:59.651
you want it to have
a certain amount of flair?

20:59.653 --> 21:01.152
I'm just asking.

21:04.690 --> 21:06.958
I'll be your
slave again.

21:06.960 --> 21:09.160
I'll do whatever
you want.

21:09.162 --> 21:11.512
Just help her.

21:11.514 --> 21:12.797
No.

21:16.785 --> 21:18.236
Get me out of here.

21:20.872 --> 21:23.725
I can't even
look at him.

21:23.727 --> 21:24.976
Come on.

21:29.898 --> 21:31.766
Elena: Jeremy!

21:31.768 --> 21:32.900
Did you find
anything?

21:32.902 --> 21:34.152
He's not on the trail.

21:34.154 --> 21:35.737
His gear's
still here.

21:35.739 --> 21:37.259
Stefan: He's not
at the quarry, either.

21:38.557 --> 21:40.275
Split up.

21:40.277 --> 21:42.327
I'm gonna stay and try
a locator spell.

21:43.562 --> 21:45.196
Ok. I'll stay here.

21:45.198 --> 21:46.781
I'll make sure
she's safe.

21:46.783 --> 21:48.584
I'll stay here and make sure
you're not lying.

21:52.454 --> 21:54.539
Fine. We'll keep
searching the island.

22:07.102 --> 22:09.920
[Beeping]

22:11.106 --> 22:12.490
Thought it didn't work.

22:12.492 --> 22:15.360
Yeah. I'm just--
just checking the signal.

22:15.362 --> 22:16.927
So you can call someone?

22:18.180 --> 22:20.031
Like whoever
took Jeremy?

22:20.033 --> 22:22.200
This place has a habit
of getting to you, doesn't it?

22:23.435 --> 22:25.386
See for yourself.

22:25.388 --> 22:26.904
I'm done trusting you.

22:26.906 --> 22:29.824
Uhh!
Where's the cure?

22:29.826 --> 22:32.076
You know that magical well I was
telling you about?

22:32.078 --> 22:34.128
Silas and the cure
are buried deep below it.

22:34.130 --> 22:35.129
So, you've seen it?

22:35.131 --> 22:37.465
No.

22:37.467 --> 22:39.884
But you could say I heard it from
a reliable source.

22:43.806 --> 22:45.273
Caitlin.

22:45.275 --> 22:46.791
How is this happening?

22:47.843 --> 22:49.594
You're bleeding.
What?

22:49.596 --> 22:51.729
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

22:51.731 --> 22:53.881
No. It's good.
It's ok.

22:53.883 --> 22:56.100
It's what's
keeping me here.

22:56.102 --> 22:59.354
If a single drop of blood
can give you a vision,

22:59.356 --> 23:01.356
could you imagine what
two liters could do?

23:01.358 --> 23:03.224
What does your dead wife
have to do with a cure?

23:03.226 --> 23:04.475
She got nothing to do
with a cure,

23:04.477 --> 23:07.045
but she has everything
to do with Silas.

23:07.047 --> 23:09.013
I'm so sorry I let
things get out of control.

23:09.015 --> 23:10.248
I should've stopped you.

23:10.250 --> 23:11.949
Sweetheart, it's ok.

23:12.968 --> 23:15.086
You wanted Sam back
as much as I did.

23:18.507 --> 23:21.426
What if you had a second
chance to bring us both back?

23:21.428 --> 23:23.428
I can't, baby.
I'm not a witch.

23:23.430 --> 23:24.595
We have a witch.

23:25.931 --> 23:27.582
His name is Silas.

23:29.268 --> 23:31.936
If you set him free, he'll help
those who have helped him.

23:31.938 --> 23:35.156
Set him free from--
from what?

23:35.158 --> 23:38.342
He's entombed
in the caves below us,

23:38.344 --> 23:39.677
but it's impossible
to get him out

23:39.679 --> 23:40.828
without a spell.

23:42.013 --> 23:43.514
You need to get
the spell.

23:45.117 --> 23:46.367
Shane, voice-over:
And that's when she explained

23:46.369 --> 23:48.569
everything that I had to do.

23:48.571 --> 23:51.789
Complete the Hunter's
mark to access the spell

23:51.791 --> 23:54.275
and empower a descendant
of Qetsiyah to perform it.

23:58.414 --> 24:01.165
Bonnie Bennett's related
to this crazy-ass witch?

24:58.474 --> 25:01.809
Elena: Jeremy!
[Voice echoes]

25:01.811 --> 25:04.312
Jeremy!
Why don't you yell louder?

25:04.314 --> 25:05.596
Maybe we haven't
drawn enough attention

25:05.598 --> 25:06.764
to ourselves already.

25:06.766 --> 25:08.866
I'm sorry, and how
are you helping?

25:08.868 --> 25:10.785
I'm stronger than you
and faster than you

25:10.787 --> 25:11.769
and I'm quite certain

25:11.771 --> 25:12.770
I can charm
the islanders

25:12.772 --> 25:14.104
a lot easier
thank you.

25:14.106 --> 25:15.706
Not disagreeing
on the easy part.

25:15.708 --> 25:17.107
All right, we get it.
You two hate each other.

25:17.109 --> 25:18.242
Can we just
keep going, please?

25:18.244 --> 25:19.994
I tried
being her friend,

25:19.996 --> 25:21.746
but somehow, I ended up
with a dagger in my back

25:21.748 --> 25:23.113
because I'm the evil one.

25:23.115 --> 25:24.949
Technically, you didn't
achieve evil status

25:24.951 --> 25:26.300
until you killed me.

25:27.302 --> 25:29.470
[Gasping]

25:39.959 --> 25:40.942
[Gasping]

25:40.944 --> 25:43.211
Nice catch.
Thank you.

25:43.213 --> 25:45.881
No, actually,
thank you.

25:45.883 --> 25:47.716
This thing
would've killed me.

25:47.718 --> 25:49.585
I don't care what
happens to you either way.

25:49.587 --> 25:51.720
But if you're gonna die,
it might as well be epic.

25:55.558 --> 25:56.925
I'm gonna go back
and check on Bonnie,

25:56.927 --> 25:59.061
see if she
found anything.

25:59.063 --> 26:00.295
Be careful.

26:06.753 --> 26:11.106
You have the rock,
hunter, Bennett witch.

26:13.059 --> 26:14.910
What about the dozens
that died in sacrifice?

26:14.912 --> 26:16.528
Where do they
fit in to all this?

26:16.530 --> 26:20.282
As you can imagine, that was
not an easy pill to swallow.

26:20.284 --> 26:21.900
Caitlin, it's me,

26:21.902 --> 26:24.052
the guy who refused to serve
a meat course at our wedding.

26:24.054 --> 26:28.323
I can't--I can't
orchestrate 3 massacres.

26:28.325 --> 26:30.125
It isn't like that.

26:30.127 --> 26:31.460
You're merely
leading these people

26:31.462 --> 26:33.128
so Silas can bring them
back from the dead.

26:33.130 --> 26:35.330
Why--why should they die
just to be resurrected?

26:35.332 --> 26:36.298
It doesn't make sense.

26:36.300 --> 26:39.000
The spell that
brings me back

26:39.002 --> 26:40.902
requires a witch
to channel

26:40.904 --> 26:43.605
an extreme amount
of mystical energy.

26:43.607 --> 26:45.307
Energy that doesn't
occur in nature.

26:45.309 --> 26:47.025
Because it
isn't natural.

26:48.478 --> 26:50.011
I'm sorry, Cate.

26:52.014 --> 26:54.650
I just--I can't do that
to innocent people.

27:04.360 --> 27:06.044
Can you feel my touch?

27:06.963 --> 27:08.530
How is this possible?

27:08.532 --> 27:11.316
Because you believe
it is possible.

27:11.318 --> 27:14.369
You believe that you
can see me again.

27:15.938 --> 27:17.673
You don't have to
take a single

27:17.675 --> 27:19.725
human life yourself,
Atticus.

27:21.160 --> 27:23.979
All you have to do
is convince someone

27:23.981 --> 27:25.847
to believe that
it is possible

27:25.849 --> 27:28.150
that they can see
a lost loved one again.

27:29.819 --> 27:31.570
And they'll do it
for you.

27:35.825 --> 27:37.776
Which is how you
manipulated the pastor

27:37.778 --> 27:39.728
to blow up a farmhouse
full of people.

27:39.730 --> 27:41.530
He just wanted to
see his wife again.

27:45.535 --> 27:47.202
We need 3 massacres.

27:47.204 --> 27:48.870
Fire at the young farm.

27:48.872 --> 27:50.839
Holiday hybrid slaughter.

27:50.841 --> 27:53.425
What mass blood-letting
am I forgetting?

27:53.427 --> 27:54.676
You're not.

27:56.713 --> 27:57.996
You're not finished.

27:59.465 --> 28:00.932
Is that why you
brought us all out here

28:00.934 --> 28:02.417
in the middle of nowhere?

28:02.419 --> 28:04.052
Massacre number 3?

28:04.054 --> 28:05.587
It doesn't work
that way, Damon.

28:08.808 --> 28:09.841
I think you need
to tell me

28:09.843 --> 28:12.194
where this magical
well is.

28:12.196 --> 28:13.862
You know I can't
do that.

28:18.201 --> 28:19.568
Oh, I know.

28:21.270 --> 28:23.121
I know.
[Slaps Shane's shoulder]

28:26.876 --> 28:29.044
[Crying]

28:31.914 --> 28:33.398
It's getting worse.

28:35.785 --> 28:37.719
I'm sorry.
No.

28:38.755 --> 28:42.224
It's my fault.
I'm sorry.

28:42.226 --> 28:44.893
No. You didn't
do any of this.

28:44.895 --> 28:48.680
I unsired the hybrids
and turned them on Klaus.

28:48.682 --> 28:50.565
I should've just
left it alone.

28:50.567 --> 28:52.317
You freed them, Tyler.

28:55.288 --> 28:57.139
People put their
faith in you

28:57.141 --> 28:58.640
because you're
a leader.

29:00.960 --> 29:02.494
Don't forget that.

29:08.317 --> 29:09.668
Then you trust me?

29:22.498 --> 29:25.801
You want to be in
control, Klaus? Here.

29:25.803 --> 29:27.986
Now you get to be in
control of her life.

29:27.988 --> 29:31.139
If you want her
to die, fine.

29:31.141 --> 29:32.340
But then you
can sit here

29:32.342 --> 29:34.326
and watch her
die yourself.

29:44.453 --> 29:46.238
Nothing personal, love.

29:46.240 --> 29:48.957
If I kill you,
that means victory for him.

29:50.693 --> 29:54.179
Don't worry.
It won't be long now.

30:00.870 --> 30:03.054
Where's the cure?

30:03.056 --> 30:04.639
Does it matter?

30:04.641 --> 30:07.175
I think we both know you'd
rather just torture me.

30:07.177 --> 30:08.760
Torture gives you
a sense of control,

30:08.762 --> 30:11.096
especially with your
relevance slipping away.

30:11.098 --> 30:12.731
I look at you.
Here you are,

30:12.733 --> 30:15.317
hours from Elena
breaking her sire bond.

30:15.319 --> 30:16.902
Start to freak out
a little bit.

30:16.904 --> 30:19.487
Listen, you want my advice?
Leave. Go.

30:19.489 --> 30:21.690
Don't put yourself
through this.

30:21.692 --> 30:24.693
Oh!
Fine. Ok.

30:24.695 --> 30:26.912
Let's say her feelings for you
are real.

30:26.914 --> 30:30.081
How does that end?
She's human. You're a vampire.

30:30.083 --> 30:34.119
Stop!
Mm. It's doomed, Damon.

30:34.121 --> 30:35.503
See, you're not
torturing me, man.

30:35.505 --> 30:37.071
You're torturing
yourself by helping them

30:37.073 --> 30:38.056
find the cure.

30:38.058 --> 30:40.225
I could kill you.

30:40.227 --> 30:41.710
Then no one
would find it.

30:41.712 --> 30:43.745
We've established that
you can't kill me

30:43.747 --> 30:45.847
without sending Bonnie
off the deep end.

30:45.849 --> 30:48.166
You can leave
the island.

30:48.168 --> 30:50.435
Have a modicum
of self-respect.

30:50.437 --> 30:53.054
Don't stay here and watch Elena
walk away from you.

30:53.056 --> 30:55.523
Right. Because
if I'm not here,

30:55.525 --> 30:56.858
then I can't get
in between you

30:56.860 --> 30:58.426
and whatever you're
planning with Silas.

31:00.263 --> 31:02.781
I'm not that easily
manipulated, Professor.

31:04.567 --> 31:07.268
And there is one flaw
in your logic.

31:08.738 --> 31:11.623
I don't give a crap
about Bonnie Bennett.

31:13.709 --> 31:15.543
[Groaning]

31:16.495 --> 31:17.913
What is wrong
with you?

31:23.686 --> 31:25.337
What did you say
to him?

31:25.339 --> 31:27.656
Your boyfriend's
a maniac, Elena.

31:30.192 --> 31:32.043
Stop messing
with my friends.

31:45.321 --> 31:47.873
Shane is the only thing
that's keeping Bonnie safe,

31:47.875 --> 31:49.658
and you try to kill him?

31:49.660 --> 31:51.677
And you wonder why
Bonnie hates you.

31:51.679 --> 31:55.014
I don't wonder, Elena,
because I don't care.

31:55.016 --> 31:56.799
I don't care
about her.

31:56.801 --> 31:58.384
I don't care about
some lame-ass

31:58.386 --> 32:00.836
cure for vampires, either.

32:00.838 --> 32:02.688
How can you say that
right now?

32:06.977 --> 32:08.844
Because I don't
want you to be cured.

32:12.149 --> 32:14.984
I'm not fighting with
you about this anymore.

32:14.986 --> 32:18.687
Being human isn't gonna
change my feelings for you.

32:18.689 --> 32:21.907
Fine. Say
they're real.

32:21.909 --> 32:23.859
Say you've become
human and you still love me.

32:23.861 --> 32:25.661
Then what?

32:25.663 --> 32:28.030
You grow old.
You die.

32:28.032 --> 32:29.799
I stay a vampire.

32:29.801 --> 32:33.753
Face reality, Elena.
We don't work.

32:35.572 --> 32:36.856
So, things aren't easy

32:36.858 --> 32:38.724
and you're just gonna
push me away now?

32:41.211 --> 32:43.229
That's what
you do, Damon.

32:43.231 --> 32:44.730
You think that
you don't--

32:44.732 --> 32:46.399
you don't
deserve something,

32:46.401 --> 32:48.501
so you ruin it.

32:48.503 --> 32:50.853
I'm not gonna let you
pull that this time.

32:52.239 --> 32:53.689
Take the cure with me.

33:00.363 --> 33:02.982
That's how much I know
this is real.

33:02.984 --> 33:05.067
That's how certain
I am that

33:05.069 --> 33:06.368
I'm going to love you

33:06.370 --> 33:08.537
even after this is
all over.

33:09.756 --> 33:11.073
Take the cure.

33:12.743 --> 33:14.310
Be human with me.

33:17.948 --> 33:20.900
We can be together.
Grow old together.

33:20.902 --> 33:23.702
This doesn't have
to be hard anymore.

33:27.557 --> 33:29.975
That's not me, Elena.
That's Stefan.

33:35.015 --> 33:36.966
I used to miss
being human.

33:39.903 --> 33:42.805
Now I can't think of anything
more miserable on earth.

34:02.058 --> 34:03.559
Stefan: Haven't we
been through here before?

34:03.561 --> 34:05.144
Rebekah: It all looks
the same to me.

34:12.853 --> 34:16.188
Thanks. But that
wouldn't have killed me.

34:17.440 --> 34:19.474
Sorry. Force of habit.

34:23.112 --> 34:24.478
Don't be a tease.

34:24.481 --> 34:26.899
Elena could be lurking somewhere
in the woods.

34:26.900 --> 34:28.501
Do you mean
what you said?

34:28.503 --> 34:29.935
About a cease-fire?

34:33.590 --> 34:36.442
Why do you all assume
that I hate Elena so much?

34:36.444 --> 34:39.143
Well, I mean, you did
run her off a bridge.

34:39.146 --> 34:40.963
You all seem to forget
that Elena's death

34:40.965 --> 34:42.864
was the only way
to save my family.

34:42.867 --> 34:45.184
I did the same thing
that every one of you

34:45.186 --> 34:47.353
would've done to protect
the people that you love.

34:47.355 --> 34:49.355
And before you cast me
as the bad guy,

34:49.357 --> 34:51.672
maybe you should remember
that Elena's helped to kill

34:51.675 --> 34:54.143
not one but two
of my brothers.

34:55.428 --> 34:56.896
Maybe we're not
as different as everyone's

34:56.898 --> 34:58.230
making us out to be.

34:59.983 --> 35:01.817
Jeremy's not here.
I'm going back.

35:07.991 --> 35:09.158
Bonnie?

35:20.554 --> 35:21.837
Where is everyone?

35:21.839 --> 35:23.472
What are you
talking about?

35:23.474 --> 35:26.225
Bonnie is not here
and Shane's stuff is all gone.

35:28.995 --> 35:30.179
Oh, my God.

35:31.514 --> 35:33.065
The tombstone's gone.

35:43.954 --> 35:45.722
[Caroline breathing weakly]

35:45.724 --> 35:49.742
If you don't feed me
your blood, I'll die.

35:49.744 --> 35:51.161
Then you'll die,

35:51.163 --> 35:53.096
and Tyler will have
learned his lesson

35:53.098 --> 35:54.364
the hard way.

35:56.317 --> 35:59.602
How could you
do this to him?

35:59.604 --> 36:03.573
To his mom?
To me?

36:03.575 --> 36:08.461
I'm a thousand years old.
Call it boredom.

36:08.463 --> 36:10.914
I don't believe you.

36:10.916 --> 36:12.949
Fine. Then maybe
it's because

36:12.951 --> 36:14.517
I'm pure evil,

36:14.519 --> 36:16.786
and I can't
help myself.

36:16.788 --> 36:22.959
No. It's because
you were hurt.

36:26.597 --> 36:29.132
Which means
that there is a part of you

36:29.134 --> 36:30.567
that is human.

36:41.579 --> 36:43.813
How could you possibly
think that?

36:46.917 --> 36:48.451
Because I've seen it.

36:52.923 --> 36:57.227
Because...I've caught
myself wishing

36:57.229 --> 36:59.996
that I could forget
all the horrible

36:59.998 --> 37:01.664
things that you've done.

37:04.602 --> 37:09.205
But you can't.
Can you?

37:12.810 --> 37:15.211
I know that you're
in love with me.

37:19.950 --> 37:24.520
And anybody capable
of love

37:24.522 --> 37:28.458
is capable
of being saved.

37:34.848 --> 37:36.466
You're hallucinating.

37:39.570 --> 37:41.537
I guess I'll never know.

37:44.508 --> 37:46.809
[Breathing weakly]

37:46.811 --> 37:48.061
Caroline.

37:48.063 --> 37:50.797
[Breathing weakly]

37:50.799 --> 37:52.165
Caroline.

37:58.522 --> 37:59.689
[Sniffles]

38:22.179 --> 38:23.513
Mm.

38:28.552 --> 38:31.854
[Breathing heavily]

38:31.856 --> 38:33.573
What are you doing
in my tent?

38:34.558 --> 38:35.742
Where's the tombstone?

38:35.744 --> 38:36.859
What have you done
with it?

38:36.861 --> 38:38.361
What are you
talking about?

38:38.363 --> 38:40.330
Like it's not
bloody obvious?

38:40.332 --> 38:41.897
All you people ever do
is betray me

38:41.899 --> 38:44.083
and here you go again.

38:44.085 --> 38:46.953
Let her go.
She didn't take it.

38:50.591 --> 38:52.175
Was any of this real?

38:52.177 --> 38:54.544
Was it just a ploy
to distract me

38:54.546 --> 38:56.346
while Shane ran off
with the tombstone?

38:56.348 --> 38:57.680
You think
I would do that?

38:57.682 --> 38:59.382
You think I would
let some psychopath

38:59.384 --> 39:00.850
run off with the cure?

39:00.852 --> 39:03.686
Every single moment
of my last 146 years

39:03.688 --> 39:06.255
has been ruled by the pain
of being a vampire.

39:08.809 --> 39:10.259
And this cure ends that.

39:10.261 --> 39:12.562
It ends the guilt
and it ends the suffering.

39:14.431 --> 39:17.099
And you really think
I would jeopardize that?

39:17.101 --> 39:19.369
Fine. You didn't
take it.

39:19.371 --> 39:21.070
But that doesn't
mean I trust her.

39:32.900 --> 39:34.467
I didn't take it,
but here.

39:35.753 --> 39:38.454
Consider this
a peace offering.

39:38.456 --> 39:39.472
Don't you get it, Elena?

39:39.474 --> 39:41.007
There is no peace.

39:41.009 --> 39:42.258
We're all screwed.

39:42.260 --> 39:44.293
Exactly, Rebekah.
We're screwed.

39:45.128 --> 39:46.396
Bonnie's gone.

39:46.398 --> 39:47.597
Shane's got
the tombstone.

39:47.599 --> 39:48.748
Jeremy's missing

39:48.750 --> 39:50.817
who knows if Damon's
coming back.

39:51.835 --> 39:54.654
So, us 3 right here,

39:54.656 --> 39:56.172
this is all
we've got.

39:58.141 --> 40:00.159
So, we're either
in this together...

40:01.361 --> 40:02.612
or it's over.

40:03.981 --> 40:05.148
For all of us.

40:32.226 --> 40:34.026
Jeremy.

40:34.028 --> 40:35.194
Was a bit of a
scare yesterday.

40:35.196 --> 40:37.179
Thanks for fending
off his attacker.

40:37.181 --> 40:38.314
His attacker?

40:38.316 --> 40:39.916
Jeremy was attacked
by an islander.

40:39.918 --> 40:42.151
I assumed you were his
hatchet-flinging guardian angel.

40:44.538 --> 40:45.822
That wasn't me.

40:47.324 --> 40:48.975
Then I guess there's
somebody else on this island

40:48.977 --> 40:51.461
who's desperate
to keep our hunter alive.

40:51.463 --> 40:52.829
Bonnie: How did
I get here?

40:54.465 --> 40:55.798
What the hell's
going on?

40:55.800 --> 40:57.383
I see your locator
spell worked.

40:57.385 --> 40:58.384
The path behind me--

40:58.386 --> 40:59.535
Magically disappeared?

40:59.537 --> 41:01.370
You can thank
the talents of Massak.

41:01.372 --> 41:02.588
He's a witch.

41:03.974 --> 41:05.308
Should you try to
escape, he'll ensure

41:05.310 --> 41:06.893
that you never
find your way back.

41:08.061 --> 41:12.498
So, the gang's all here.
Silas awaits.
