♪♪

00:09.510 --> 00:11.710
We are crushing
this project, Val.

00:11.712 --> 00:16.448
I thought it would take
a lot longer, but then again,
we are geniuses.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.285
Thanks
for letting us work here.

00:20.287 --> 00:23.222
I have three little brothers,
so my house is like a zoo.

00:23.224 --> 00:26.025
One of them even poops
with the door open.

00:33.034 --> 00:35.467
Psh, who does that?

00:40.141 --> 00:41.640
I think you meant
to write "boron."

00:45.312 --> 00:46.578
(giggles)

00:46.580 --> 00:48.647
"I think you meant
to write 'boron.'"

00:48.649 --> 00:52.084
Back off, she-devil!
That is my baby brother.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.587
Ha!

00:55.589 --> 00:57.423
I sound like Dad
when he was talking
about Diggie.

00:57.425 --> 01:00.025
I always thought
he sounded so crazy.

01:00.027 --> 01:01.393
(gasps)

01:01.395 --> 01:04.296
I'mma let
girlie know I'm crazy.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.768
Hey! Ha, ha, ha.

01:09.770 --> 01:12.271
How are you guys?
I'm, uh,

01:12.273 --> 01:15.607
I'm Maddie.
I'm Parker's big sister.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.242
They, uh...

01:18.412 --> 01:19.778
they call me
Mad Dog.

01:22.249 --> 01:25.617
Nice to meet you.
I'm Val.

01:28.389 --> 01:29.922
Val!

01:31.592 --> 01:34.426
(clears throat)
Do you mind if I--
mind if I sit?

01:36.931 --> 01:40.566
Um... we're kind of
working here.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.801
Oh, yeah. No, I mean, you know.

01:42.803 --> 01:45.104
Pretend I'm not even here.

in the courtyard.

02:49.370 --> 02:52.104
Is somebody challenging
me to a dance battle?

02:52.106 --> 02:54.206
Because Falcon...

02:56.777 --> 02:58.343
accepts.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.680
BOOMS is about to unveil
a new mascot.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.482
New mascot?

03:03.484 --> 03:05.617
BOOMS has a mascot?

03:05.619 --> 03:07.186
We did.

03:07.188 --> 03:09.121
But one horrible,
terrible day...

03:10.624 --> 03:14.993
All chanting:
Skeeter! Skeeter! Skeeter!
Skeeter! Skeeter!

03:14.995 --> 03:17.029
Hello, BOOMS.

03:17.031 --> 03:20.399
It is I, Skeeter, your beloved
Student Body President

03:20.401 --> 03:22.534
and the coolest kid in school.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.003
Today, I give you

03:25.005 --> 03:28.941
our new mascot,
Boomer the Bonzai Brain!

03:35.549 --> 03:36.748
Ew!

03:36.750 --> 03:38.584
That's not a brain.

03:38.586 --> 03:41.053
It's a poop
in a shower cap.

03:45.159 --> 03:47.960
(deep voice)
That story disturbs me.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.496
I heard
that as a tribute to you,

03:51.498 --> 03:53.398
our new mascot
is going to be a falcon.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.502
(deep voice)
Well, how about that?

03:59.006 --> 04:00.505
(deep voice)
No big whoop. It's just--

04:00.507 --> 04:03.542
(normal voice)
They built a statue for me!

04:03.544 --> 04:05.410
Me. (giggles)

04:06.580 --> 04:08.447
Hello, BOOMS.
It is I,

04:08.449 --> 04:12.551
Skeeter, your beloved
Student Body President

04:12.553 --> 04:15.454
and formerly the coolest kid
in school.

04:15.456 --> 04:18.557
Until Falcon took it all away.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.559
Falcon, Falcon!

04:20.561 --> 04:23.262
All chanting:
Falcon, Falcon!

04:24.565 --> 04:28.867
(deep voice)
Sorry, Skeeter. I have
a rabid fan base.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.871
You came to see a new mascot,

04:32.873 --> 04:37.175
instead, I give you... revenge!

04:42.249 --> 04:44.449
No!

04:44.451 --> 04:46.652
Yes!

04:47.888 --> 04:49.388
What's going on?

04:49.390 --> 04:50.555
Yeah, who is that guy?

04:50.557 --> 04:53.325
That's not a guy,
that's a poop in a vest.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.297
His name is Artie Smalls.

04:58.299 --> 05:03.168
He's come from Wisconsin
to take Falcon down!

05:05.306 --> 05:09.675
That's right. I've traveled
from the land of cheese
and sausage on a mission.

05:09.677 --> 05:15.347
A mission to tel you
that your hero Falcon
is a fraud!

05:15.349 --> 05:17.866
But first,

05:17.867 --> 05:20.384
what's the Wi-Fi password?
I need to email my mom
that I've arrived safely.

05:23.157 --> 05:25.257
Duh, the password's "Falcon."

05:27.027 --> 05:28.694
Minions, type it.
I can't even.

Sasha, did you
steal something from my room?

05:47.047 --> 05:48.547
Open your hand.

05:57.358 --> 06:01.360
Sasha, this is the only thing
that I have from my mother.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.529
How could you steal this?

06:06.400 --> 06:08.066
I had to know
if it matched mine.

06:15.209 --> 06:16.708
What?

06:17.678 --> 06:19.578
How is that possible?

06:19.580 --> 06:21.713
When my mother was dying,

06:21.715 --> 06:23.081
she gave me this

06:23.083 --> 06:28.653
and told me that
the other half belonged...
to my sister.

06:29.723 --> 06:30.722
Sister?

06:34.395 --> 06:35.761
You're my sister?

06:37.664 --> 06:38.764
Whoa.

06:41.268 --> 06:46.238
Ah! Okay, that scene
gives me major goosebumps.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.107
Cousins by chance,
sisters on TV.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.742
Hey!

06:50.744 --> 06:55.614
Yes, I'm so happy to finally
have a sister who can sing.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.550
Don't tell Maddie
that I said that.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.685
I won't, she scares me.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.655
Don't tell Maddie
I said that.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.226
I'm so excited
for this next episode.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.594
It has that great song.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.797
I've been singing it so much
that my throat is starting
to hurt.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.598
Please don't get sick.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.067
I don't want anything to stop us
from doing the next episode.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.770
I am going to stop you
from doing that next episode.

07:20.541 --> 07:23.241

07:28.749 --> 07:32.717
Ruby, I had to tell
the producers that you
cannot shoot another episode

07:32.719 --> 07:34.653
until you finish
your science project.

07:34.655 --> 07:37.789
Wait, Ruby.
Have you not been
doing your homework?

07:39.059 --> 07:42.060
Learning this week's dance moves
seemed more important.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.161
And more fun.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.666
Okay, well, school
is always more important.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.334
So, what's the project, Mom?

07:49.336 --> 07:51.603
We are studying
kinetic energy.

07:51.605 --> 07:54.306
She needs to design a container
that will stop an egg

07:54.308 --> 07:56.741
from breaking when dropped
from the top of a ladder.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.777
It is a super cool project

07:58.779 --> 08:00.378
from a super cool set teacher.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.749
Well, a super cool teacher
would just let me pass.

08:04.751 --> 08:07.686
Oh, I'm not that super cool.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.860
(deep voice)
I can't wait to see

08:14.862 --> 08:17.529
what the salt air does
to your clown hair.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.030
(laughs)

08:20.601 --> 08:23.335
Oh! That's how you talk now?

08:23.337 --> 08:25.103
Okay. Okay, lemme try.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.705
(deep voice)
Salt air.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.708
I'm in a leather jacket
at the beach. Blah, blah, blah.

08:31.778 --> 08:35.013
Artie, reveal Falcon's
shameful secrets.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.983
Students of BOOMS,

08:37.985 --> 08:41.853
tomorrow, I will reveal
the hideous truth

08:41.855 --> 08:44.389
about this fool
you call Falcon.

08:44.391 --> 08:45.857
Tomorrow?

08:45.859 --> 08:47.392
Why can't we take him
down right now?

08:47.394 --> 08:49.761
Because the minions and I
have a whale watching tour
at 2:00.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.565
Minions, California exit.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.107
No one told me
we were doing that!

09:04.411 --> 09:06.177
Falcon?

09:06.179 --> 09:08.413
What's Artie talking about?

09:08.415 --> 09:12.250
(deep voice)
Ignore the red-haired
ball of anger.

09:12.252 --> 09:15.820
(deep voice)
So says Falcon!

09:15.822 --> 09:19.190
(normal voice) That red-haired
ball of anger is gonna
take me down.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.759
So says Joey.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.561
(whimpers)

09:27.100 --> 09:29.935
Okay, Ruby, so let's
drop that egg! Whoo!

09:31.104 --> 09:32.804
-Here goes.
-Yay!

09:37.344 --> 09:40.478
Okay, so what did we learn?

09:41.415 --> 09:43.782
That I'm a terrible egg dropper

09:43.784 --> 09:46.785
and that your fake enthusiasm
is annoying?

09:49.890 --> 09:52.390
Ruby, we have to figure
something out.

09:52.392 --> 09:56.595
I mean, if you don't pass this
then they're gonna write you
out of the episode.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.096
I'm trying!

09:58.098 --> 10:01.366
I'm just--
I'm a dancer,
not an egg dropper.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.302
Well, you have to figure
something out.

10:04.304 --> 10:07.872
I mean, you know, work as hard
on this as you do on
your dance moves.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.942
You just gave me
the best idea.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.777
You're a genius!

10:13.947 --> 10:15.380
I am? Ha-ha.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.483
I am.

10:22.823 --> 10:26.057
All right, now let's get back
to that chemistry project.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.727
You're really good
on that board.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.896
(sighs) He is, isn't he?

10:34.301 --> 10:36.267
Maddie, hi.

10:36.269 --> 10:39.004
Hey! Welcome back, Val.

10:39.006 --> 10:42.273
Hey, do you, um--
Do you want some
fresh lemonade?

10:42.275 --> 10:44.976
-Sure.
-Parker, go get the girl
some lemonade.

10:45.946 --> 10:50.849
Or maybe we could
all go in together.

10:50.851 --> 10:54.586
(groans) I don't know,
I sort of feel like Val
likes it out here.

10:54.588 --> 10:55.820
Am I right about that, Val?

10:58.659 --> 10:59.924
Okay.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.830
Thank you, Parker.
So sweet of you.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.632
-Love you.
-(door closes)

11:07.634 --> 11:09.167
What are your intentions
with my little brother?

11:10.370 --> 11:14.305
Uh... To get an A
on our chemistry project.

11:14.307 --> 11:15.874
Ah, yes.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.343
This chemistry project

11:18.345 --> 11:20.712
that will allow you two...

11:20.714 --> 11:23.381
to spend so much time together.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.850
And then
Parker's gonna get attached,

11:25.852 --> 11:28.953
and you're gonna
break his heart

11:28.955 --> 11:32.824
when you decide to run off
to some exotic location
to study abroad.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.794
Like, Tundrabania or Australia.

11:38.565 --> 11:39.964
What's happening?

11:43.203 --> 11:45.070
Hi. (chuckles)

11:45.072 --> 11:48.373
Val, Parker has
your lemonade inside.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.141
So, go there,
now, please.

11:54.681 --> 11:56.047
It's okay.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.052
What are you doing?

12:01.054 --> 12:02.087
Saving Parker.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.588
From Val?

12:03.590 --> 12:06.925
The honor student
who volunteers at
an animal rescue?

12:09.029 --> 12:12.530
Okay, I know she may seem
sweet and innocent, but I see
right through that.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.998
And Parker just can't.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.534
You know, the girl comes along
and just flips her hair to him

12:16.536 --> 12:19.370
and the poor boy doesn't
stand a chance!

12:19.372 --> 12:23.441
Maddie, our little brother
has his first crush
and it's cute.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.343
It's like, so cute.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.679
No, 'cause see,
Parker's not ready.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.114
Not ready for what?

12:29.116 --> 12:32.350
He's not ready
for this big world
filled with heartache.

12:32.352 --> 12:35.353
You know, I mean,
somebody has to protect him.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.923
And Dad's off in Wisconsin,
so I guess that somebody
is me.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.994
Okay. So you are Dad now?

12:44.965 --> 12:46.297
Yes.

12:46.299 --> 12:50.135
Okay. And you realize
how crazy you sound?

12:51.938 --> 12:53.638
Yes.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.174
But you're gonna do it
anyway.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.643
Yes.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.280
(whispering)

13:02.282 --> 13:05.817
(deep voice) Excuse me.
Pardon Falcon, thank you.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.821
Well, well, well.

13:09.823 --> 13:12.090
Enjoying your final moments
as Falcon?

13:12.092 --> 13:14.626
I didn't think you'd have
the guts to show up today.

13:14.628 --> 13:19.063
Well, I just wanted
to show everyone
my cool new belt.

13:19.065 --> 13:21.499
Dang it! That is
a cool belt!

13:26.139 --> 13:29.073
(deep voice)
This may be the last time
you see Falcon fly.

13:29.075 --> 13:32.010
If it is,
it's been an honor.

13:34.414 --> 13:40.718
(keytar entrance music)

13:43.490 --> 13:46.024
Students of California land,

13:46.026 --> 13:48.993
join me as I expose
the myth of Falcon.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.031
Okay.

13:56.203 --> 14:00.205
Back in Wisconsin,
this boy was Joey Rooney,

14:00.207 --> 14:03.107
the laughingstock
of Ridgewood High.

14:03.109 --> 14:05.043
He had no friends.

14:05.045 --> 14:08.646
He was a la-hoo-za-her.

14:08.648 --> 14:11.482
You're talking about Falcon?

14:11.484 --> 14:12.884
No way.

14:12.886 --> 14:16.054
Oh, I understand.
You're scientists.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.956
You need evidence.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.525
Well, allow me to prove
my hypothesis

14:20.527 --> 14:24.195
with a multimedia extravaganza
the likes of which
you've never seen.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.832
<i>(fanfare playing)</i>

14:27.834 --> 14:30.201
I present to you
my thesis.

14:38.011 --> 14:43.047
This is Joey as failed mascot
Bobby Butterstick.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.183
Failed mascot?

14:45.185 --> 14:46.718
I don't believe it.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.319
Believe it!

14:49.522 --> 14:53.424
This is Joey as
garbage-eating robot Munchbot.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.493
I can't look at this.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.229
Well, then look at this!

14:58.231 --> 15:02.967
Joey missing out on a date
because he trapped himself
inside a prank-proof box.

15:04.271 --> 15:07.205
Falcon, say it's not true?

15:07.207 --> 15:10.041
It's worse than I ever
could have imagined.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.610
This is the greatest moment
of my life,

15:12.612 --> 15:15.680
and I've been voted
King of Space Camp
like multiple times.

15:17.117 --> 15:21.452
Oh, the onslaught continues,
my fake astronaut friend.

15:23.089 --> 15:27.825
Joey wasn't even cool enough
to come up with his own
cool name.

15:29.195 --> 15:31.062
<i>Eat my exhaust.</i>

15:31.064 --> 15:33.131
<i>You'll never catch</i>
<i>the Falcon.</i>

15:33.133 --> 15:34.999
<i>(screeches)</i>

15:36.937 --> 15:41.272
Yes! Joey Rooney
is a fraud.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.142
I am the Falcon.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.843
(screeches)

15:48.248 --> 15:51.215
You're not deep
and mysterious?

15:52.619 --> 15:54.519
You're just a liar.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.822
It's all true.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.892
I should go.

16:00.894 --> 16:03.461
Falcon has been vanquished!

16:03.463 --> 16:07.398
And I once again reign
as the coolest kid at BOOMS.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.467
Minions, exit music!

16:09.469 --> 16:13.304
(keytar exit music playing)

16:17.310 --> 16:19.577
I can't believe he
was the coolest kid in school.

16:21.014 --> 16:23.381
California is a strange place.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.919
It is.

16:27.921 --> 16:32.590
For example, here,
my minions apparently think
they can speak to me!

16:37.030 --> 16:38.262
All right, Ruby.

16:38.264 --> 16:40.331
So get up there
and drop that egg.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.967
Hope there's no splatter
from the ladder.

16:42.969 --> 16:44.769
See what I did there?

16:44.771 --> 16:47.572
It rhymes.
(singsongy) Oh, I make
learning fun! Mm!

16:49.976 --> 16:52.043
Actually, since
I finished this late,

16:52.045 --> 16:54.278
I'm gonna do
better than the ladder.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.782
One egg ready to drop, cuz.

16:57.784 --> 17:02.186
Liv helped me think about
the project in terms of
something I know: dance.

17:02.188 --> 17:05.289
See, when you leap and spin,

17:05.291 --> 17:08.226
it slows down your momentum,
which softens the impact.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.195
Let my egg dance, Liv.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.364
Give me an egg drop beat, Ruby.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.833
♪ Uns, uns, uns, uns ♪

17:15.835 --> 17:17.235

17:26.546 --> 17:29.347
The egg did not break.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.649
So I passed?
I can shoot the episode?

17:31.651 --> 17:33.684
Sure can.
You proved your theory.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.620
You must have had
a great teacher.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.331
Both:
Nice shirt.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.766
Both:
Great minds think alike.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.401
Both:
Whoa.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.271
Hey.

17:57.010 --> 17:58.476
Morning, Val.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.216
Can I have everyone's attention
for a second?

18:08.455 --> 18:09.754
I'm sorry.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.723
I'm sorry
that I let you all down.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.393
I've been an outcast
my whole life.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.095
I'm not the cool guy.

18:17.097 --> 18:20.131
I chewed erasers
for seven years

18:20.133 --> 18:22.633
because my little brother
told me they were a type of gum.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.870
I also got him
to hug a cactus.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.206
Yeah, he did.

18:29.476 --> 18:33.344
When I came to BOOMS,
I saw a chance to
reinvent myself.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.447
Yeah, guys,

18:36.449 --> 18:39.050
it felt really good
to be popular.

18:39.052 --> 18:41.752
But, guys,
I'm not Falcon.

18:41.754 --> 18:44.088
I'm Joey.

18:44.090 --> 18:47.391
I'm kitty-T-shirt-wearing Joey.

18:50.830 --> 18:51.496
Wow.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.301
So, you weren't
just lying to us,

18:57.303 --> 19:00.538
you were trying to become
the person you wanted to be.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.574
By lying to us.

19:06.279 --> 19:10.248
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

19:10.250 --> 19:13.117
Yeah, well who here
hasn't lied to feel better
about themselves?

19:13.119 --> 19:15.486
This morning, I told myself
this shirt looked cool,

19:15.488 --> 19:16.621
I knew it didn't.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.489
That doesn't make me a bad guy.

19:21.427 --> 19:24.328
Joey, you were brave enough
to try something new.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.864
And when it all
crashed and burned,

19:26.866 --> 19:28.799
you owned up to it.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.536
And that's really cool.

19:31.538 --> 19:34.172
Falcon didn't do that.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.606
Joey did.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.208
Hm.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.911
Well, I guess
I did, didn't I?

19:41.614 --> 19:45.516
And now you've embraced
your loserness to become
even cooler than before!

19:46.386 --> 19:47.718
Joey!

19:47.720 --> 19:52.356
Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey!

19:52.358 --> 19:54.392
-(chanting continues)
-No! Stop!

19:54.394 --> 19:57.862
How is this still happening?

19:57.864 --> 20:01.098
There is literally never
a good reason to have you
around.

20:02.235 --> 20:05.169
How was I to know this school
would respect honesty?

20:05.171 --> 20:07.104
It's disgusting.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.374
