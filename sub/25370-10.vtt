WEBVTT

00:00.563 --> 00:03.119
Make an honest man of me.
Marry me, Reets.

00:03.914 --> 00:07.009
You know you're the only woman
I ever gave my heart to.

00:07.204 --> 00:09.697
And you've turned into
quite something.

00:13.777 --> 00:15.530
You'll fucking keep, bitch.

00:15.617 --> 00:17.282
And the Butchers
have got the full amount?

00:17.370 --> 00:20.056
Twenty kilos, premium.
Two o'clock tomorrow.

00:20.144 --> 00:22.124
The Butchers?
You sure...

<font color="#ffff00">WEBRip error
(00:00:22,000 to 00:00:32,000)</font>

00:31.483 --> 00:32.864
they're not into drugs
anymore?

00:32.952 --> 00:34.170
Yeah, that's what
I told you.

00:34.258 --> 00:35.803
So you told your boyfriend

00:35.944 --> 00:39.357
about the little drug deal you overheard
us talking about with the Butchers?

00:39.444 --> 00:41.108
Winter and Drago are
suss on me.

00:41.866 --> 00:43.819
Just leave it with us.
We'll sort it out.

00:43.932 --> 00:45.335
Well, we know
who the rat is.

00:45.644 --> 00:47.749
Makes me very happy
it's not you, Rita.

00:48.632 --> 00:49.936
This is for Marie.

00:50.530 --> 00:52.653
- Oof!
- You're a fucking rat!

00:52.741 --> 00:54.670
Agh! Help! Agh!

00:57.085 --> 00:59.447
Vera knows.
No, not about you, about Jesper.

00:59.535 --> 01:01.037
What I did.
She fucking knows.

01:01.124 --> 01:02.426
- He is going to jail.
- Vera.

01:02.514 --> 01:04.342
- He is a murderer! And Will...
- So am I.

01:05.037 --> 01:07.395
Show me where you buried her.
I want you to take me there.

01:07.483 --> 01:10.010
- Have you ever been back?
- Why would I go back there?

01:10.098 --> 01:11.793
To make sure
the body is still there.

02:14.213 --> 02:15.293
Hey.

02:29.951 --> 02:31.036
How'd you sleep?

02:34.809 --> 02:37.466
As far as I am concerned,
last night didn't happen.

02:40.224 --> 02:41.857
Someone put those gloves
in your house.

02:41.945 --> 02:43.951
- If it wasn't Ferguson who was it...
- Why don't you do some bloody work?

02:44.038 --> 02:45.833
Find out what
happened to Cherry Li.

02:56.040 --> 02:58.263
I can't get that image
out of my head.

02:58.450 --> 03:00.075
I'm really sorry, Vera.

03:00.326 --> 03:02.575
I didn't want to get you involved
in this.

03:03.195 --> 03:04.494
But you did.

03:11.883 --> 03:13.371
<i>You heard anything
about Cherry?</i>

03:14.080 --> 03:15.744
<i>Seriously fucked her up.</i>

03:15.884 --> 03:17.426
<i>Screws aren't saying anything.</i>

03:17.514 --> 03:19.064
<i>I don't think we'll see
her back here again.</i>

03:19.116 --> 03:20.438
<i>Shit, what about Cherry?</i>

03:20.526 --> 03:22.671
- <i>Ohh, poor thing!
- Ah, should've seen her,</i>

03:22.759 --> 03:24.642
<i>She's such a fuckin' mess!</i>

03:26.192 --> 03:27.424
Aagh!

03:36.086 --> 03:37.385
<i>This is for Marie</i>.

03:37.473 --> 03:39.770
<i>Or Marie... for Marie...
for Marie... for Marie...</i>

03:44.680 --> 03:45.880
Hey, Liz.

03:46.795 --> 03:48.002
Everything OK?

03:50.577 --> 03:52.096
What's the matter?

03:53.070 --> 03:56.299
S-Someone said your name.
Were-Were you in here?

03:56.408 --> 03:57.676
Sorry, I don't understand...

03:57.764 --> 04:00.566
I was in the showers and I...
I heard the whole thing.

04:01.569 --> 04:04.127
Someone... someone said your name.

04:06.774 --> 04:08.057
You...

04:08.447 --> 04:10.189
You hurt Cherry.

04:27.874 --> 04:29.308
There was a fucking witness.

04:29.395 --> 04:32.579
Now in future, you only do something
when I ask you.

04:32.667 --> 04:34.611
Cherry was the rat.
I was protecting you.

04:34.699 --> 04:37.907
Well, you didn't!
And now we're both in the shit.

04:38.103 --> 04:39.249
Who is it?

04:39.337 --> 04:41.072
- I'll shut her up.
- Uhuh-uh-uh!

04:41.477 --> 04:42.757
You've done enough.

04:52.915 --> 04:54.165
Hey, Booms.

04:54.620 --> 04:56.814
- Yuh.
- You bash Cherry I.?

04:57.431 --> 05:00.306
- Eh?
- Simple question, Booms, yes or no.

05:01.182 --> 05:02.342
No.

05:02.555 --> 05:05.407
Well, she beat ya. I mean,
it's only fair you'd want to get even.

05:05.501 --> 05:07.540
Yeah, but I never.

05:07.767 --> 05:09.282
I find out
you're bullshitting me...

05:09.370 --> 05:10.712
I'm not, OK?!

05:10.800 --> 05:12.407
- Can I...?
- Sure.

05:13.673 --> 05:15.181
Fuckin' hell.

05:15.305 --> 05:16.353
Hey.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.368
Hey. Chocky?

05:18.487 --> 05:20.407
- Oh, no, thanks, love.
- Good.

05:20.495 --> 05:22.095
Hey, what was all that about?

05:22.198 --> 05:24.198
Hmm? Oh, nothin'.

05:24.294 --> 05:25.574
You in trouble?

05:25.795 --> 05:27.243
I'm always in bloody trouble, eh?

05:27.471 --> 05:29.481
Well, that's true.

05:33.595 --> 05:34.806
Hey.

05:35.595 --> 05:36.908
How's your visit?

05:36.995 --> 05:38.259
Yeah, good.

05:38.347 --> 05:40.493
- You got a little pressie for me?
- Mm-hmm.

05:43.267 --> 05:44.307
OK.

05:44.496 --> 05:46.016
Now that's your cut.

05:46.821 --> 05:48.977
- Thanks, beautiful.
- Thanks.

05:49.103 --> 05:52.196
- You said you didn't want none? Hm.
- No, I don't want any, I'm right.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.618
- Hey.
- Um. Hey.

05:55.798 --> 05:58.227
I'd like to have
a chat with Liz, please.

05:59.148 --> 06:00.428
What about?

06:00.775 --> 06:02.267
Well, that's private.

06:02.571 --> 06:03.712
Ohh.

06:04.977 --> 06:06.399
You all right?

06:06.532 --> 06:07.715
Yeah.

06:09.656 --> 06:11.142
Thanks, Boomer.

06:12.528 --> 06:16.955
Liz, you're wrong about Cherry,
because I wasn't there.

06:17.149 --> 06:19.418
But I heard your name.
Someone...

06:19.506 --> 06:22.600
Someone said your name, right?

06:22.688 --> 06:25.553
I don't want to get in trouble
for something that I didn't do.

06:25.767 --> 06:27.678
Someone bashed Cherry.

06:27.787 --> 06:29.475
That could have been anyone.

06:30.061 --> 06:33.952
Boomer, I mean, she's got a motive.
I mean, there are plenty women who do.

06:34.209 --> 06:35.280
Boomer?

06:35.368 --> 06:36.598
Liz, sweetheart,

06:36.693 --> 06:40.030
- I think you're a bit confused.
- Nah. No, no, I... I can't re...

06:40.355 --> 06:43.075
Fuck, why can't I remember
what I saw?

06:43.170 --> 06:45.280
I don't understand
why you think I was there.

06:45.368 --> 06:47.913
Because I'm sick, alright?

06:52.496 --> 06:55.056
I've... I've got dementia.

07:00.355 --> 07:01.588
Shit, I'm sorry...

07:01.675 --> 07:02.999
Yes, me too.

07:03.139 --> 07:04.139
I didn't know...

07:04.227 --> 07:06.227
Yeah, well, now you do.

07:07.601 --> 07:10.272
Look, if you need anything,
any help at all, I'm...

07:10.616 --> 07:12.035
just ask, alright?

07:12.342 --> 07:14.302
I'll be here for you.

07:31.126 --> 07:32.947
Listen,
stop it. Go away.

07:33.830 --> 07:35.080
Ms Myles?

07:35.325 --> 07:36.338
What is it, Connors?

07:36.426 --> 07:38.432
You heard anything
about Cherry I.?

07:38.526 --> 07:40.070
They're saying
she's a head on a stick.

07:40.157 --> 07:42.223
- A what?
- A quadriplegic.

07:42.376 --> 07:44.546
She won't walk again,
that's for sure.

07:45.375 --> 07:47.489
Don't suppose you know anything
about the bashing?

07:48.731 --> 07:50.747
No... no, I don't.

07:50.981 --> 07:52.379
Didn't think so.

08:06.646 --> 08:07.979
Shit.

08:08.931 --> 08:10.270
The Butchers?

08:12.133 --> 08:14.075
You were dead set
they were dealin'.

08:14.624 --> 08:16.364
So, you tell me what happened.

08:17.109 --> 08:18.610
I got it wrong.

08:19.098 --> 08:20.833
What do you want me to do?

08:21.350 --> 08:23.129
I want a decent explanation.

08:24.013 --> 08:25.504
The club blames me.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.036
My best mates want me dead.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.125
I am so sorry.

08:31.340 --> 08:32.986
That's not good enough, Ree.

08:33.168 --> 08:34.385
I love you.

08:34.804 --> 08:38.368
Took a lot of guts to
ask you to marry me, because...

08:39.799 --> 08:41.261
deep down inside...

08:42.068 --> 08:43.517
I knew you'd say no.

08:43.629 --> 08:45.286
- I said yes.
- Not like you meant it.

08:45.387 --> 08:47.922
- It's just so fucking complicated.
- Nah...

08:48.629 --> 08:50.480
it's not fucking complicated.

08:51.821 --> 08:54.317
It's really, really simple.

08:55.227 --> 08:57.590
You either want to be
with me, or you don't.

08:57.737 --> 08:58.937
I do.

08:59.055 --> 09:01.825
You know, I... I always
felt like you were...

09:02.659 --> 09:04.182
holdin' back...

09:05.431 --> 09:07.525
but I let it go, because, um...

09:09.042 --> 09:10.761
'cause I fuckin' love you.

09:12.042 --> 09:14.145
I figured one day, you'd crack...

09:14.385 --> 09:16.075
you'd let me in, and, um...

09:17.088 --> 09:18.522
and, well, we'd...

09:21.215 --> 09:22.770
But you never did, babe.

09:25.524 --> 09:27.239
With you in here...

09:27.930 --> 09:30.473
and all this shit goin' down,
and...

09:31.286 --> 09:33.138
I reckon it's time.

09:35.355 --> 09:37.821
The look on your face
kinda says it all.

09:41.912 --> 09:43.067
Yep.

09:44.980 --> 09:46.512
You take care, babe.

09:58.389 --> 09:59.887
Do you wanna go to
education...

09:59.997 --> 10:01.379
and, like, pay-out
on the nerds?

10:01.467 --> 10:03.801
No, I'm gonna go and
have a lie down, love.

10:03.935 --> 10:05.135
OK.

10:05.496 --> 10:07.115
- Hey.
- What?

10:07.202 --> 10:09.771
You been actin' a, like,
a bit weirder than normal.

10:09.858 --> 10:11.589
- Oh.
- Yeah, you OK?

10:11.676 --> 10:14.161
Yeah, yeah, I'm just...
I'm tired, Booms.

10:14.771 --> 10:15.794
OK.

10:15.988 --> 10:17.869
Jenkins, you got a
visitor tomorrow morning.

10:18.208 --> 10:19.690
- Huh?
- You heard.

10:19.778 --> 10:22.463
But... everyone
I know's in here.

10:23.466 --> 10:24.893
I need you to come in.

10:26.647 --> 10:28.195
Thanks, Mrs Hayes.

10:30.336 --> 10:31.606
Rita?

10:32.770 --> 10:36.259
Uh, yeah, great, I-I'll
see you tomorrow. OK.

10:48.631 --> 10:49.942
I'm fine.

10:50.980 --> 10:52.621
Did you have visit today...

10:52.752 --> 10:54.283
from your man?

10:55.878 --> 10:57.815
His name's Ray.

10:58.143 --> 10:59.847
You look happy, sis.

11:00.542 --> 11:01.754
We were.

11:03.648 --> 11:05.083
Was one of the good ones.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.293
It's over now.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.715
Fuck, I hate
bein' stuck in here...

11:18.903 --> 11:20.348
Me, too.

11:26.392 --> 11:27.989
Fuck off.

11:29.134 --> 11:30.809
You big crybaby.

11:30.958 --> 11:33.536
Yeah, well, I've wiped your
nose plenty of times in here.

11:41.050 --> 11:43.035
Oh, what the fuck.

11:46.651 --> 11:48.535
Agh! Help!

11:55.455 --> 11:56.781
Ow!

13:01.885 --> 13:03.342
Jesus.

13:05.007 --> 13:06.218
We don't know
what it means.

13:06.306 --> 13:07.987
Someone knows
what I did to Ferguson.

13:08.075 --> 13:10.885
- It can't be about you.
- Someone saw us at the grave, Jake!

13:10.972 --> 13:13.073
Can you just fuckin' chill
for a minute?

13:13.820 --> 13:14.939
Have you contacted them?

13:15.027 --> 13:17.549
No, that's what they want,
attention, panic.

13:17.994 --> 13:19.543
OK, so what do we do?

13:21.278 --> 13:23.314
I... guess we...

13:23.567 --> 13:26.486
wait for them to tell us what
they know, think they know.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.645
Are you absolutely sure
we are the only ones

13:30.732 --> 13:32.353
who know what happened
to Ferguson?

13:34.002 --> 13:35.975
Yeah.
We're sure.

13:37.185 --> 13:38.304
What?

13:38.391 --> 13:40.415
- Who else did you tell?
- No one!

13:40.502 --> 13:42.318
- You sure you haven't said anything?
- Yes!

13:42.405 --> 13:43.830
- Franky?
- No.

13:43.918 --> 13:45.217
What about your new girlfriend?

13:45.305 --> 13:47.119
- No.
- What's going on?

13:48.313 --> 13:51.200
- You know you can trust me, Will.
- Yeah, I know.

13:51.898 --> 13:54.226
Ferguson's dead,
that's all I care about.

13:59.373 --> 14:01.086
Wha...?!

14:10.563 --> 14:11.658
Hey.

14:12.682 --> 14:15.295
Michael Armstrong, I
represented Sonia Stevens.

14:16.212 --> 14:18.424
Ohh, haven't you heard?

14:18.736 --> 14:19.962
She cactus.

14:20.049 --> 14:21.377
Yes, I realise,
and that's a

14:21.465 --> 14:22.940
- terrible business.
- I don't want to talk about it

14:23.027 --> 14:24.247
- No, that's not why I'm here.
- Or nothin'...

14:24.334 --> 14:25.338
Please, sit.

14:29.587 --> 14:32.978
Oh... is... is this
about the defecation?

14:33.584 --> 14:34.917
You know, that um...

14:35.033 --> 14:37.527
the papers were printing
lies about me, and...

14:37.614 --> 14:38.907
Defamation.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.556
No, no, that's not it.

14:41.330 --> 14:43.701
About a month ago,
Ms Stevens asked me

14:43.788 --> 14:46.968
if there was anything I could do,
regarding your sentence.

14:48.127 --> 14:50.111
Uh, oh...
you mean like an appeal,

14:50.199 --> 14:52.205
- or-or somethin'? Oh.
- Yeah. Yes, exactly. Yeah.

14:52.293 --> 14:53.295
Hm.

14:53.383 --> 14:56.852
So, I've looked at your file,
and I do think you have grounds.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.051
I don't have money to pay
you, or nothin'...

14:59.139 --> 15:00.351
No, no. No, that's all right.

15:00.438 --> 15:02.241
Ms Stevens has already covered it.

15:03.356 --> 15:04.673
- Did she?
- Mmm.

15:04.854 --> 15:06.845
Clearly you were
very important to her.

15:09.012 --> 15:11.295
- Ohh...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

15:11.623 --> 15:13.392
- Have I upset you?
- No.

15:17.055 --> 15:18.255
Nuh...

15:23.130 --> 15:24.712
I'm good.

15:26.849 --> 15:28.806
- I'm good.
- All right, then.

15:28.894 --> 15:31.228
Ah... well, maybe you can
help me with a few facts, hmm?

15:31.316 --> 15:34.423
- Now, it says here with your, um...
- That's my name there.

15:34.511 --> 15:37.307
Yeah, it is, yeah.
Susan, I see.

15:37.526 --> 15:39.011
They call me "Boomer".

15:40.017 --> 15:41.729
- Hi, Boomer.
- Hi.

15:43.524 --> 15:45.666
Oh, Lizzie, it's your favourite.

15:45.754 --> 15:47.001
Oh, yeah.

15:47.936 --> 15:49.055
Is that all you're havin'?

15:49.143 --> 15:50.994
- Yep, just veggies.
- You're good.

15:51.356 --> 15:53.462
- Oh, yum.
- Hmm.

15:54.794 --> 15:56.776
You feeling better today, Liz?

15:57.688 --> 15:59.217
Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.
Yeah.

15:59.305 --> 16:00.859
Hey, I meant
what I said before.

16:00.947 --> 16:03.744
If you want any help,
just let me know, right?

16:03.920 --> 16:05.413
Yeah, all right.

16:05.517 --> 16:07.039
- You right?
- Yeah.

16:08.692 --> 16:10.531
It was Birdsworth, wasn't it?

16:10.618 --> 16:12.525
Hey, you stay away from her,
all right?

16:12.613 --> 16:15.392
She's got dementia, she's confused,
she doesn't know what she saw.

16:15.480 --> 16:17.166
I'm taking care of it, OK?

16:20.579 --> 16:22.004
All right...

16:22.310 --> 16:24.562
I got one thing to say,
bitches!

16:25.215 --> 16:29.361
OK? Youse were all wrong
about Sonia, especially you!

16:29.449 --> 16:31.321
And she was a good person!

16:31.422 --> 16:33.759
Jenkins,
stop yelling and get your food!

16:35.183 --> 16:37.858
See, Sonia has hired me
a lawyer, right?

16:37.946 --> 16:39.355
And he's awesome.

16:40.001 --> 16:43.001
And he's kind of sexy,
and he's getting me out.

16:43.206 --> 16:44.744
- Sonia?
- Yeah.

16:44.832 --> 16:48.611
See, you care about Cherry
Chopsticks, right? She's scum.

16:48.743 --> 16:50.556
But a good person like Sonia?

16:50.644 --> 16:53.099
You just...
push her off a roof!

16:53.988 --> 16:56.212
You're a shit Top Dog!

16:58.147 --> 16:59.384
Booms...?

16:59.511 --> 17:00.933
Sit down, Boomer.

17:02.089 --> 17:05.671
You see, the papers were right,
eh? Sonia is an angel, right?

17:05.759 --> 17:07.384
She's my angel.

17:08.472 --> 17:09.875
So, suck it.

17:12.078 --> 17:13.394
Suck it!

17:14.054 --> 17:15.259
Suck it!

17:20.077 --> 17:21.325
Kaz?

17:22.671 --> 17:25.093
I reckon
you're a great Top Dog.

17:25.624 --> 17:27.970
Not good enough
to protect Cherry Li.

17:36.327 --> 17:37.527
Oh...

17:37.939 --> 17:39.228
Liz?

17:49.874 --> 17:51.486
Hey.

17:52.249 --> 17:54.400
I just need to be alone
for a minute.

17:55.685 --> 17:57.142
What do you know?

17:57.691 --> 17:58.751
About what?

17:58.894 --> 18:00.189
Liz.

18:03.281 --> 18:05.606
I don't fuckin' know
anything, Kaz. It...

18:05.694 --> 18:08.205
My mind's all over
the bloody place.

18:25.262 --> 18:29.236
I was in the
showers when Cherry got bashed!

18:29.535 --> 18:30.738
Who did her?

18:31.199 --> 18:32.415
Don't know!

18:32.557 --> 18:36.517
I... I thought I heard someone,
and then I... I thought I s-s...

18:36.675 --> 18:39.017
saw s... someone else.

18:40.723 --> 18:42.422
No, dunno.

18:42.645 --> 18:45.007
- Don't...
- It's OK, it's OK.

18:48.385 --> 18:50.775
I think it might've been Boomer.

18:53.861 --> 18:55.103
I do.

19:01.703 --> 19:04.200
- Surprise.
- Sit down.

19:09.898 --> 19:11.548
What the hell are you doing here?

19:11.864 --> 19:14.114
Your mum said you weren't
gonna be back until next week.

19:14.215 --> 19:16.349
Booked an earlier flight,
got in late last night.

19:16.451 --> 19:18.841
<i>Hey! Oh, my God!</i>

19:19.125 --> 19:20.539
How are you coping?

19:21.438 --> 19:22.873
Thanks for coming!

19:23.259 --> 19:25.025
I need to talk to you
about something.

19:27.923 --> 19:29.129
You know that...

19:29.548 --> 19:31.673
you know that bloke
who raped you?

19:34.600 --> 19:36.126
Someone killed him.

19:37.198 --> 19:39.423
He... his mum is a prisoner
in here,

19:39.510 --> 19:41.719
and she's asking
questions about that night.

19:43.377 --> 19:44.869
She wants to know
what happened.

19:44.997 --> 19:47.131
Whoever killed that fucker
did the world a favour.

19:47.218 --> 19:48.767
They have photos
from the bar.

19:49.004 --> 19:51.915
Her people are
tracking down everyone.

19:52.422 --> 19:53.798
Now if they come knocking...

19:53.886 --> 19:55.986
I'll tell them
her son was a prick.

19:56.705 --> 19:58.244
You don't get it.

19:58.938 --> 20:01.720
Marie is dangerous.

20:08.058 --> 20:10.035
If you do that,
you'll be dead.

20:15.879 --> 20:17.733
You should've stayed
in New York.

20:22.116 --> 20:24.916
Hey! Who's the hot chick?

20:25.029 --> 20:26.291
Just a mate.

20:26.411 --> 20:29.017
- Hmm? Is she your ex?
- Nuh, she's just a mate.

20:29.185 --> 20:32.150
- You don't need to feel weird about it.
- I don't.

20:32.990 --> 20:34.190
Come on.

20:34.502 --> 20:35.892
We have five minutes.

21:00.178 --> 21:01.738
They've sent
another message.

21:03.217 --> 21:04.513
Came through
a few minutes ago.

21:04.601 --> 21:06.709
Shit... 500K?

21:06.899 --> 21:08.904
Where the fuck are we
going to get 500K from?

21:08.992 --> 21:11.211
- I don't know!
- They must've seen us!

21:11.348 --> 21:13.285
They haven't said
what they saw.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.630
- If we don't pay, we're fucked.
- Well, have you got a spare 500K?

21:17.116 --> 21:19.839
- You could mortgage your house.
- You could go fuck yourself.

21:19.927 --> 21:21.454
I don't want to go to prison!

21:22.153 --> 21:24.553
Look, even if we did pay,
do you think that'd be the end of it?

21:24.640 --> 21:26.469
Blackmailers don't stop.

21:26.930 --> 21:28.359
So, what do we do?

21:29.039 --> 21:30.443
I need some time.

21:35.464 --> 21:38.105
She'll sort it.
She's got money.

21:55.166 --> 21:57.565
She's pinned.
Give her a hand.

21:57.783 --> 21:59.727
Whoa, OK... Taylah...
yeah,

21:59.821 --> 22:02.197
why... why don't we...
why don't you rest for a bit, eh?

22:04.142 --> 22:06.303
Come on... Taylah...

22:10.142 --> 22:11.261
What?

22:11.348 --> 22:13.978
Little birdie told me you <i>were</i>
in the shower block with Cherry.

22:14.065 --> 22:17.451
Oh, yeah? Well, your little
birdie is tweetin' bullshit!

22:17.538 --> 22:19.418
But you know what
I fuckin' hate, Boomer?

22:19.628 --> 22:21.314
Is when people lie to me.

22:21.402 --> 22:23.941
I'm not fuckin' lyin' to ya!

22:24.338 --> 22:26.456
Nuh, you're not stitchin'
my hand for this.

22:26.559 --> 22:29.261
Just keep quiet,
everything'll be fine.

22:33.918 --> 22:37.142
- Oh, someone call an officer!
- Smiles?!

22:39.690 --> 22:41.298
- Sierra 6 to Medical. Require...
- Oh!

22:41.385 --> 22:43.545
- I didn't touch her!
- assistance in laundry, over.

22:44.093 --> 22:45.387
Looks like an OD.

22:45.613 --> 22:47.158
We tossed her cell,
found a foil.

22:47.308 --> 22:49.786
- The Doctor's sent it off for testing.
- Keep me posted.

22:50.544 --> 22:52.423
What are you doing
about that message?

22:57.271 --> 22:59.501
Ah, Linda just scored
a lead on Cherry Li.

22:59.589 --> 23:01.409
- From whom?
- Well, it's just a rumour,

23:01.497 --> 23:03.583
but she thinks we should
toss Jenkins' cell.

23:03.879 --> 23:05.111
- Boomer Jenkins?
- Mmm.

23:05.199 --> 23:07.705
- I'll organise the toss.
- No, I'll... I'll do it.

23:08.391 --> 23:09.705
I'll come with you.

23:14.273 --> 23:16.428
Bullshit. What are you
even looking for, anyway?

23:16.516 --> 23:18.898
- Keep quiet, Jenkins!
- But I haven't done nothin'!

23:19.126 --> 23:21.715
This was under her mattress.
There's blood on it.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.399
- What?
- Slot her.

23:26.487 --> 23:28.704
- No. No, no... that's not mine!
- Come on, Jenkins, you're stalling.

23:28.791 --> 23:29.922
No, someone planted it!

23:30.009 --> 23:32.884
No, no! No, 'cause
I'm gettin' my parole!

23:32.972 --> 23:34.979
No, you can't mess that up!

23:39.122 --> 23:41.550
No! No, 'cause it's not...

23:41.645 --> 23:44.758
No, I don't want...
it wasn't me!

23:44.958 --> 23:46.672
It wasn't me!

23:49.861 --> 23:52.620
Can someone please believe me?!
'Cause it wasn't me!

23:52.708 --> 23:54.213
No, no!

23:54.983 --> 23:57.001
It wasn't me!

24:07.007 --> 24:09.041
I need the truth about Cherry.

24:09.435 --> 24:13.068
- I told you, I wasn't there.
- Yeah, but Drago was!

24:13.241 --> 24:14.634
I saw her.

24:15.378 --> 24:17.837
Oh, I think you might be
getting confused again.

24:17.925 --> 24:20.767
No, love, I'm not confused,
I remembered.

24:20.920 --> 24:23.733
Liz, I swear, I don't know what
you're talking about, all right?

24:23.820 --> 24:25.502
Boomer's locked up,
it's done, just leave it.

24:25.589 --> 24:27.672
Yeah, but what if
she's innocent?

24:28.399 --> 24:30.650
The weapon was found
in her cell.

24:30.738 --> 24:33.833
- Yeah, and that could've been planted.
- Or, what if she's guilty?

24:34.462 --> 24:37.275
Sweetheart, I think you
need to rest, all right?

24:37.363 --> 24:38.471
'Cause if you keep going on
like this,

24:38.558 --> 24:40.439
- you're gonna end up in the psych ward.
- Oh...

24:40.527 --> 24:43.022
And we don't wanna lose you,
do we? Liz?

24:43.728 --> 24:45.030
Liz!

24:53.083 --> 24:55.388
- You heard all that?
- Hm.

24:57.395 --> 25:00.417
- You framed Jenkins.
- I took care of business.

25:00.505 --> 25:02.433
Our business is on the outside.

25:02.613 --> 25:05.189
That is where
our focus needs to be.

25:05.277 --> 25:08.283
Or do you want to live in this
shithole all your fucking life?

25:08.371 --> 25:09.562
I was protecting you.

25:09.650 --> 25:12.949
- I didn't ask for it!
- You didn't have to.

25:13.104 --> 25:15.064
You knew I'd do it anyway.

25:20.334 --> 25:21.856
I'd do anything for you.

25:22.837 --> 25:24.068
You know that.

25:26.700 --> 25:28.048
I love you, Marie.

25:30.448 --> 25:32.744
Don't pretend
it's a surprise.

25:35.168 --> 25:39.673
You look at me like I'm nothing...
like I'm a piece of shit.

25:41.346 --> 25:45.563
But you know better than me...
I do this because you can't.

25:45.736 --> 25:47.714
Because you don't have
the guts!

25:48.127 --> 25:52.483
Hey...
do not touch Birdsworth!

25:52.751 --> 25:56.705
I am the one who goes down
if she talks. This is on me.

25:56.793 --> 25:59.369
I decide now, not you.

26:09.427 --> 26:10.932
I'm not hungry.

26:12.145 --> 26:13.694
Can you just give us a minute?

26:16.791 --> 26:18.564
I hate mashed potato.

26:20.007 --> 26:21.729
- No, you don't.
- I do.

26:22.758 --> 26:24.494
Well, when it's cold, I do.

26:24.858 --> 26:26.839
Oh, geez, you're lucky...

26:27.121 --> 26:28.751
I brought you these, then.

26:29.392 --> 26:30.592
Oh.

26:40.743 --> 26:45.580
I was gettin' outta here...
oh, for about five seconds.

26:48.771 --> 26:50.627
Well, maybe you still can?

26:51.055 --> 26:52.174
How?

26:52.276 --> 26:55.649
Well, what if I told the screws I
was there when Cherry got bashed,

26:55.737 --> 26:57.073
and tell them that
it wasn't you?

26:57.161 --> 26:59.785
- That's a dumb idea, Liz.
- Why?

27:00.403 --> 27:03.709
'Cause you got the dementia,
you know?

27:04.566 --> 27:09.372
They'd know that you, you know,
might be... makin' shit up. You know?

27:09.898 --> 27:13.119
- Yeah... yeah, you're right.
- Yeah.

27:13.701 --> 27:15.445
Cheers, but, eh?

27:20.338 --> 27:23.938
- I'm sorry.
- Oh no, it's not your fault.

27:40.052 --> 27:42.596
Peer worker visit.
Mr. Jackson approved it.

27:42.684 --> 27:43.965
Make it quick.

27:44.086 --> 27:45.338
Thank you.

27:47.168 --> 27:48.418
You OK?

27:48.582 --> 27:50.272
Yeah, I dunno what happened.

27:50.359 --> 27:51.900
I just had a little taste, I swear.

27:51.987 --> 27:54.924
You are so young, sweetheart,
you don't need that shit.

27:55.231 --> 27:58.369
- Yeah, I do.
- Taylah, it'll kill you.

27:59.148 --> 28:00.574
They tossed your cell.

28:01.629 --> 28:03.864
I know you've got another
stash, so where is it?

28:04.747 --> 28:07.362
- Just tell me, and I'll ditch it.
- No way.

28:08.231 --> 28:11.951
I am trying... to do you a favour.

28:12.139 --> 28:14.467
That's enough, Proctor.

28:39.407 --> 28:41.105
You... you, what do you want?

28:44.924 --> 28:49.343
Shit! No, no, please!
No! No! Please!

28:49.438 --> 28:52.672
- Get back! Don't hurt me!
- Zara!

28:57.131 --> 28:59.396
You tell anyone,
you die.

29:06.806 --> 29:08.168
It's OK...

29:08.255 --> 29:11.658
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey, it's OK.
- Oh!

29:22.784 --> 29:26.101
Oh, God... well, that's
it, then. I'm fucked.

29:26.188 --> 29:29.932
- Don't worry, I will speak to her.
- Oh, fat lot of good that'll do.

29:31.830 --> 29:33.571
Maybe it's for the best?

29:33.869 --> 29:36.135
Beats dying in a nut house...

29:36.643 --> 29:41.133
pissing myself while
my brain turns to mush.

29:41.619 --> 29:45.049
Oh, God... I need a drink.

29:45.234 --> 29:46.434
D'you want me to get you one?

29:46.521 --> 29:48.448
Ah, I'm supposed to
be on the wagon. Mmm.

29:48.536 --> 29:50.268
Well, we've all got our vices.

29:50.615 --> 29:51.784
I miss it.

29:51.938 --> 29:55.718
I really bloody miss it,
it's the best painkiller there is.

29:57.588 --> 29:59.590
I can't handle this any more.

30:00.003 --> 30:02.362
You should've let
Drago shiv me.

30:04.973 --> 30:06.237
Cheers.

30:07.092 --> 30:08.729
- Will?
- Yeah?

30:09.002 --> 30:11.752
Bullock's toxicology
report came through...

30:11.909 --> 30:13.977
heroine laced with rat poison.

30:14.065 --> 30:16.709
She's very lucky she didn't die, I
need you to call in the dog squad.

30:16.796 --> 30:19.961
Sure thing. Hey, um, can... can
we talk about the other thing?

30:20.049 --> 30:21.502
I got a conference call.

30:22.659 --> 30:25.116
Hey... has she decided what to do?

30:25.268 --> 30:27.992
Mate, it's 500 grand, not
a fucking parking fine.

30:28.080 --> 30:30.095
What if she goes to the
cops, throws us under the bus?

30:30.182 --> 30:32.596
- She wouldn't.
- Well, someone might!

30:32.971 --> 30:35.080
So you might wanna
talk her into paying up.

30:37.028 --> 30:38.726
You didn't show up for work.

30:40.388 --> 30:42.014
I'm not feeling well.

30:43.771 --> 30:45.320
This about Boomer?

30:48.901 --> 30:50.828
How did the screws find out, Kaz?

30:50.916 --> 30:52.149
I dunno.

30:52.237 --> 30:53.744
I didn't say anything.

30:57.683 --> 30:59.215
What's wrong, Liz?

31:00.838 --> 31:02.776
I don't think Boomer was there.

31:03.622 --> 31:05.880
You can't rely on me
any more, no-one can.

31:06.871 --> 31:09.979
I can't remember anything.

31:13.252 --> 31:16.276
You know what my nan
did to remember things?

31:16.751 --> 31:18.671
She made a memory box.

31:19.284 --> 31:22.440
She'd write little notes to herself,
favourite memories, birthdays,

31:22.557 --> 31:23.776
- that kind of stuff.
- Mmm.

31:23.893 --> 31:26.143
It became this really special thing.

31:27.260 --> 31:29.924
- Why don't we do that?
- Mmm.

31:31.880 --> 31:33.127
Proctor?

31:35.662 --> 31:38.065
Get some rest.
We'll chat later.

31:42.377 --> 31:45.146
Report came back
on Bullock's OD...

31:45.479 --> 31:47.643
she had rat poison
in her system.

31:48.820 --> 31:50.176
That gear could've killed
someone.

31:50.263 --> 31:52.768
If there's some in this prison,
you need to get rid of it.

32:00.326 --> 32:01.754
Hang on!

32:06.377 --> 32:08.006
Come in!

32:12.776 --> 32:14.386
Kaz saw Taylah.

32:14.519 --> 32:15.736
She's OK.

32:15.853 --> 32:18.345
Oh, good.
I was a bit worried about that.

32:18.464 --> 32:21.081
Please tell me
the OD wasn't your fault.

32:21.323 --> 32:22.901
Of course it wasn't.

32:27.096 --> 32:28.513
Actually, don't sit on...

32:35.591 --> 32:36.905
Fuck!

32:37.302 --> 32:40.718
- I wish you didn't need that shit.
- I don't need it.

32:41.205 --> 32:42.619
I like it.

32:45.326 --> 32:46.929
Where should I hang these?

32:59.962 --> 33:01.574
What do the stickers mean?

33:01.916 --> 33:04.432
Oh, we know who they are,
we've questioned them.

33:04.751 --> 33:07.125
We haven't found the
others yet, but we will.

33:07.705 --> 33:09.541
One of them knows
something.

33:12.739 --> 33:14.843
Actually, sweetheart,
could I just have a minute?

33:14.931 --> 33:17.158
Just... need a minute.

33:39.861 --> 33:42.061
I know Boomer wanted
to fight Cherry, but...

33:42.650 --> 33:44.936
I didn't think she'd
do something so brutal.

33:45.318 --> 33:48.048
You're totally not
listening to me right now.

33:48.213 --> 33:49.658
What have I done wrong?

33:49.876 --> 33:52.614
What? No, nothing.

33:52.830 --> 33:54.900
Well, something's going on.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.380
Do you really wanna know?

33:58.658 --> 34:00.507
Yeah, I'm asking,
aren't I?

34:09.118 --> 34:11.626
It's about that girl
from the visitors centre.

34:13.347 --> 34:14.797
What about her?

34:14.908 --> 34:17.563
I saw more photos
on Marie's wall.

34:18.629 --> 34:20.438
She was at that bar, too.

34:22.821 --> 34:25.344
Did you...
did you tell Marie?

34:25.447 --> 34:28.431
I... I wanted to talk
to you about it first.

34:29.408 --> 34:30.527
Did she see anything?

34:30.614 --> 34:33.922
- Does she know what happened to Danny?
- No, no, no, no. She has no idea.

34:34.167 --> 34:36.572
- So, you asked her?
- Yeah, of course I did.

34:37.534 --> 34:38.931
Right, OK.

34:41.943 --> 34:44.388
Hey... can y...
can you do me a favour?

34:44.853 --> 34:47.322
Can you just not tell
Marie about this?

34:48.449 --> 34:50.670
I-I don't want anyone
hassling Shelley.

34:50.830 --> 34:53.016
Sure... sure.

34:53.862 --> 34:55.793
Sorry,
I had to ask.

34:55.955 --> 34:57.782
No, no, it's OK.

34:58.142 --> 34:59.884
Come here.

35:01.169 --> 35:02.384
Crap.

35:29.361 --> 35:30.561
Liz?

35:33.938 --> 35:35.205
What?

35:35.688 --> 35:36.908
What...?

35:46.463 --> 35:47.947
What's that for?

35:48.744 --> 35:50.137
It's heroine.

35:50.713 --> 35:53.033
If you still want
a painkiller...

35:53.193 --> 35:54.937
it's the best there is.

35:55.791 --> 35:57.592
It's everything I have in here.

35:57.978 --> 35:59.370
There's three hits.

35:59.457 --> 36:03.955
If you shoot it all at once...
you're not going to wake up.

36:05.221 --> 36:10.115
Now Liz... you should be
able to choose how this ends.

36:10.306 --> 36:11.625
Fuck off!

36:13.108 --> 36:16.312
Oh shit, I'm sorry,
this was a bad idea.

36:17.650 --> 36:20.403
I just thought
you should know you have...

36:20.490 --> 36:21.969
you have some choices.

36:22.616 --> 36:23.816
Wait.

36:28.619 --> 36:30.413
Show me how to do it.

37:50.618 --> 37:51.818
Liz?

37:57.236 --> 37:58.571
No!

38:06.559 --> 38:09.178
I just want to die.

38:11.612 --> 38:13.926
Please, don't do this.

38:14.214 --> 38:16.848
It's my choice, Kaz.

38:16.936 --> 38:19.449
I want to decide when
and how it happens,

38:19.566 --> 38:23.715
I wanna be in control of
it, not some fucking disease!

38:25.090 --> 38:27.754
You're right... you should.

38:29.266 --> 38:30.481
But not now.

38:30.569 --> 38:33.163
I just want it to be
over now!

38:33.251 --> 38:36.955
And I can't fuckin' hang
around waiting for you,

38:37.043 --> 38:39.738
because you feel guilty
about your nan, love.

38:39.855 --> 38:41.574
I care about you.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.012
You didn't give me a way out.

38:56.559 --> 38:58.686
Who gave you the hotshot?

38:59.687 --> 39:01.092
It was Marie.

39:07.903 --> 39:09.762
Will you please let me
get rid of it?

39:13.184 --> 39:14.404
Please?

39:32.395 --> 39:34.024
How did it go with
Birdsworth?

39:34.152 --> 39:35.582
Oh, she'll be dead
by the count.

39:35.670 --> 39:37.620
What if
she doesn't shoot up?

39:37.708 --> 39:40.238
Oh, look, she barely knows
what day it is, all right?

39:40.325 --> 39:42.754
Boomer's in the slot.
Either way, it's over.

39:42.842 --> 39:44.707
Right? We're off the hook.

39:44.801 --> 39:46.442
Got you a present.

39:47.024 --> 39:49.050
Scored it from D block.

40:08.589 --> 40:09.897
Peer worker business.

40:10.030 --> 40:11.657
You're dedicated.

40:14.463 --> 40:16.603
- Where's the rest of your stash?
- Not tellin' you, Kaz...

40:16.690 --> 40:19.497
It's laced with rat poison,
you can't take it, so hand it over.

40:20.263 --> 40:24.823
Don't make me angry,
just tell me where it is... now!

40:34.880 --> 40:37.729
Attention, H block.
Dinner will commence in 10 minutes.

40:37.924 --> 40:40.815
Prisoners, can make their
way to the dining room.

41:17.566 --> 41:19.230
Vera won't talk to me.

41:21.223 --> 41:22.752
Is she paying up?

41:23.035 --> 41:25.861
- I need to know what the fuck's going on.
- Look, she won't talk to me either, OK?

41:25.948 --> 41:27.806
Well, demand some fucking answers!

41:28.811 --> 41:31.231
- Look, she likes you, use that.
- OK.

41:31.366 --> 41:32.861
Sweet talk her!

41:32.949 --> 41:36.132
Mate, if she doesn't do something,
we'll both wind up in prison.

41:36.546 --> 41:39.030
I'll go down for conspiracy,
but you fucking killed her, mate,

41:39.117 --> 41:41.265
- you'll get life.
- Get... get out of my face, OK?

41:41.353 --> 41:43.160
Tell Vera at the pay up,
you dumb fuck!

41:43.248 --> 41:45.187
- Ugh!
- Oof! Ju...!

41:45.513 --> 41:47.004
Oh, shit!

41:47.616 --> 41:48.816
Ugh!

41:49.458 --> 41:51.181
Shit!

41:54.137 --> 41:55.554
Oh!

42:03.671 --> 42:05.061
Oh...

42:05.686 --> 42:07.589
Why did you come here?

42:11.820 --> 42:13.020
I don't know.

42:16.856 --> 42:18.318
Do you want sympathy?

42:18.406 --> 42:21.406
Do want to guilt me
into paying that money?

42:23.720 --> 42:25.452
I don't wanna go to prison.

42:25.656 --> 42:27.906
We're in this together,
we should be making decisions

42:27.994 --> 42:29.457
- together!
- Jake!

42:29.904 --> 42:31.502
I know you don't need me.

42:32.005 --> 42:33.559
You don't need anyone.

42:36.295 --> 42:38.466
But maybe someday,
you might.

42:41.278 --> 42:42.795
I don't think so.

42:51.480 --> 42:53.629
I haven't paid
that money...

42:54.782 --> 42:56.593
because I don't know
what to do.

42:56.680 --> 42:58.540
I've never been blackmailed
before,

42:58.627 --> 43:00.679
I feel sick to my stomach
all the time.

43:00.767 --> 43:02.296
Yeah, I remember the feeling.

43:04.215 --> 43:05.464
Shit.

43:06.767 --> 43:09.796
There is someone out there
who knew about you and Ferguson.

43:10.260 --> 43:11.382
Someone with a grudge,

43:11.470 --> 43:14.098
- someone who already blackmailed me.
- Who?

43:15.478 --> 43:17.574
Who was governor when
the escape happened?

43:19.820 --> 43:21.265
Derek Channing.

43:28.800 --> 43:30.851
- You OK?
- Yep.

43:33.128 --> 43:35.398
Count's in ten. You
should be in your unit.

43:35.852 --> 43:39.320
Shelley came to see
me... and Allie saw her.

43:39.443 --> 43:40.616
I...

43:40.703 --> 43:42.681
And then, she recognised
Shelley from the photos.

43:42.768 --> 43:43.968
Oh, shit!

43:44.099 --> 43:47.120
Look... I lied, but
I think she bought it.

43:47.327 --> 43:49.218
Ru, you're gonna have
to cut Allie loose.

43:49.306 --> 43:51.026
This is just gettin'
too dangerous.

43:54.341 --> 43:55.957
But I love her.

43:59.036 --> 44:01.234
Sometimes you gotta give up
the things you love

44:01.452 --> 44:02.999
to protect yourself.

44:04.729 --> 44:07.038
Fuck! Marie,
can you hear me?

44:07.850 --> 44:11.474
What the hell happened?!
Marie? Oh, Marie?

44:11.578 --> 44:14.163
Shit, Marie?! Wake up, Marie!

44:14.251 --> 44:16.804
- Is she breathing?
- I don't know! Go get help!

44:16.892 --> 44:18.928
- Give me some space.
- Stop it.

44:30.384 --> 44:32.195
Oh, I wonder
what's happened.

44:35.308 --> 44:37.366
Some junkie overdosed.
