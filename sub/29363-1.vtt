01:41.561 --> 01:43.940
Well, you even started a fire.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.198
Just like the good old days.

01:46.223 --> 01:48.964
I didn't want to run down your battery.

01:49.301 --> 01:51.511
Oh, her? Nah.

01:52.228 --> 01:53.964
Solid as a rock.

01:54.542 --> 01:56.311
Just like you.

02:06.472 --> 02:08.925
What on earth are you doing with that?

02:09.895 --> 02:12.190
Oh, this little peashooter?

02:13.229 --> 02:16.853
Well, someday I'll tell ya
about what they call the, uh...

02:16.878 --> 02:19.161
"Guadalajara Jukebox."

02:20.130 --> 02:23.001
But this is mostly just for show.

02:23.292 --> 02:25.681
I find that the... mere sight of it

02:25.706 --> 02:27.854
usually tends to deter any trouble.

02:28.097 --> 02:29.097
Hmm.

02:32.061 --> 02:33.870
But how are you, dear?

02:35.188 --> 02:36.605
Truly.

02:40.895 --> 02:42.870
It's very strange,

02:43.104 --> 02:46.668
to think that he's just not
in the world anymore.

02:46.693 --> 02:49.738
It is. It's okay, Roma.

02:50.895 --> 02:52.520
I'm here now.

02:52.863 --> 02:55.441
Hmm. Now.

02:55.853 --> 02:59.328
Look, I'm... I'm sorry
about the funeral.

02:59.353 --> 03:02.254
No, I shouldn't have.
That was not fair of me.

03:02.561 --> 03:06.286
- I understand.
- It's just from Budapest to here,

03:06.311 --> 03:07.910
it couldn't be done.

03:07.948 --> 03:09.613
And besides...

03:10.092 --> 03:12.134
Father knew my heart.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.684
You're right. Of course.

03:15.262 --> 03:17.473
He always did want you out there...

03:17.788 --> 03:19.870
living a giant life.

03:21.598 --> 03:22.598
Well,

03:22.985 --> 03:25.245
I don't know if
I quite accomplished that,

03:25.269 --> 03:28.895
but there certainly is magic in travel.

03:29.248 --> 03:31.578
You meet new and interesting people,

03:31.603 --> 03:34.131
get a glimpse inside their lives...

03:35.225 --> 03:37.748
their secrets, and then...

03:38.592 --> 03:40.853
well, then you just move on.

03:41.701 --> 03:45.311
It was was something akin to
living inside a kaleidoscope.

03:46.812 --> 03:48.078
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

03:48.103 --> 03:50.687
That sounds very interesting.

03:52.047 --> 03:53.383
Yeah.

03:55.561 --> 03:58.514
So what, this'd be the, uh...

03:58.943 --> 04:03.411
Well, we'll have a paved walk, here,

04:03.436 --> 04:05.186
to the reception lobby,

04:05.506 --> 04:10.228
with quarters in the back
for the night manager.

04:10.631 --> 04:14.936
And our guests can load and
unload their luggage right here.

04:15.458 --> 04:17.137
Incredible.

04:17.826 --> 04:19.334
Just incredible.

04:19.704 --> 04:22.100
So then that's a...

04:22.125 --> 04:24.270
well, that'd be room 101,

04:24.295 --> 04:26.131
102, and 103...

04:26.156 --> 04:28.615
Yes, and so on and
so on around that way,

04:28.640 --> 04:30.826
and on the east side,

04:30.851 --> 04:33.662
we have room to expand
another block of rooms

04:33.687 --> 04:34.978
if we want.

04:35.506 --> 04:37.603
Well, you've thought of everything.

04:38.061 --> 04:41.037
And I must say, when you said
we'd be having a picnic dinner,

04:41.062 --> 04:44.145
I was not expecting
an actual picnic dinner.

04:44.353 --> 04:46.201
I'm famished.

04:47.290 --> 04:50.585
Well, I thought
one more night at the old spot

04:50.610 --> 04:52.436
before they start digging.

04:52.915 --> 04:58.429
It's fancier than the camp food
Father'd fix for us, but...

04:59.219 --> 05:02.790
Remember what he used
to call them? "Hobo packs"? Right?

05:02.978 --> 05:05.882
"Some loose chuck, and onions in foil."

05:05.907 --> 05:08.843
"Throw 'em on the coals till
they crackle and boil," right?

05:08.868 --> 05:11.648
"Add a pinch of pepper
or some mustard seed...

05:11.673 --> 05:14.812
"... and that'll be all
you need to feed ya."

05:23.743 --> 05:28.009
Well, I sure didn't think I'd ever
find myself in the hotel business.

05:28.912 --> 05:32.103
The location is ideal,
once the interstate is done.

05:32.128 --> 05:33.618
It'll be a landmark.

05:33.643 --> 05:35.796
Our family's legacy.

05:35.821 --> 05:38.173
I guess what I mean is, I never thought

05:38.198 --> 05:39.790
I'd find myself at all, really,

05:39.815 --> 05:42.203
but yes, no...

05:42.228 --> 05:45.290
What you've done, it's remarkable.

05:46.937 --> 05:50.329
Well, Bill Winthrop
has been very supportive.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.454
He assisted with the permits and the...

05:53.487 --> 05:54.836
- county zoning...
- Good ol' Bill.

05:54.860 --> 05:56.978
Always there to take the wheel.

05:59.161 --> 06:01.570
The title claims and so forth.

06:01.595 --> 06:02.595
Mmm!

06:02.948 --> 06:05.115
He said my business prospectus

06:05.140 --> 06:09.019
was... one of the best-written
he'd ever seen.

06:09.503 --> 06:12.370
Good ol' Bill. Where do I sign?

06:18.790 --> 06:20.040
Mmm.

06:21.853 --> 06:23.636
Just perfection.

06:27.425 --> 06:29.758
Uh, your fingers.

06:29.937 --> 06:32.019
Right, right.

06:51.483 --> 06:53.558
Bill does good work.

06:55.369 --> 06:57.550
Let's make it official.

07:03.326 --> 07:04.698
And...

07:05.298 --> 07:07.198
just like that...

07:08.853 --> 07:10.862
it's all ours.

07:11.420 --> 07:13.698
Who knows? This might
even be good for me,

07:13.739 --> 07:15.058
settlin' down.

07:15.347 --> 07:17.260
Heck, I might even get married.

07:17.285 --> 07:20.620
One thing at a time, brother.

07:23.013 --> 07:24.322
Now...

07:25.384 --> 07:26.870
did, uh...

07:27.911 --> 07:29.953
Well, did you ever find someone?

07:29.978 --> 07:31.645
You know, someone special?

07:32.606 --> 07:33.878
No.

07:34.825 --> 07:36.616
No, I never did.

07:37.978 --> 07:39.687
I'm not very...

07:40.918 --> 07:42.712
Those things can be difficult.

07:42.737 --> 07:45.878
- Romance, ya know.
- Oh I... Don't I know it.

07:45.903 --> 07:48.245
Oh, you do, do you?

07:48.270 --> 07:51.183
Well, I just mean that, well...

07:52.119 --> 07:54.120
when one's traveling,

07:54.753 --> 07:58.062
you tend to forge
a lot of relationships, and...

07:58.087 --> 07:59.938
Traveling, yes, I'm sure.

08:00.840 --> 08:02.143
But it can also be quite difficult

08:02.167 --> 08:05.142
when one must stay at home
to wipe one's own father's bottom.

08:06.345 --> 08:08.204
Do you know about that, as well?

08:11.019 --> 08:12.612
Well, I...

08:15.007 --> 08:17.587
I... I don't.

08:19.935 --> 08:21.133
No.

08:22.618 --> 08:25.882
And you never held him
while he wept like a baby

08:25.907 --> 08:27.603
and called out to his own mother

08:27.628 --> 08:29.878
whom he thought was
in the room with him.

08:33.102 --> 08:35.535
Once he said to me... The pain, he said

08:35.561 --> 08:38.370
that it felt like there was a rat king

08:38.395 --> 08:40.759
living in his bowel.

08:42.860 --> 08:44.907
Do you know what that is?

08:49.840 --> 08:51.119
Of course I do.

08:51.144 --> 08:53.095
That's horrible, I...

08:53.120 --> 08:56.958
With the... little crown and...

08:57.093 --> 09:01.928
It... must have been terrible,
and I'm so sorry, Roma.

09:01.953 --> 09:04.395
Well, that's why I'm here, I suppose.

09:04.624 --> 09:06.770
Solid as a rock.

09:12.140 --> 09:14.492
I'm sorry. I don't know
what's wrong with me.

09:14.517 --> 09:17.453
I'm not angry at you, not really.

09:17.478 --> 09:18.770
I just miss him.

09:20.269 --> 09:21.796
I do too.

09:23.978 --> 09:27.467
It was supposed to be a special night.

09:27.492 --> 09:30.406
Well, it is special. You've made is so.

09:30.741 --> 09:33.951
Well, I'm sorry I got upset.

09:33.976 --> 09:35.413
Listen.

09:35.439 --> 09:38.014
You don't ever have to apologize to me.

09:38.038 --> 09:40.960
From this moment forward, I'm here.

09:41.296 --> 09:43.570
Partners. Fifty-fifty.

09:49.373 --> 09:51.406
Well, then let's toast.

09:53.870 --> 09:55.953
To Herbert J. Avalind

09:55.978 --> 09:59.351
and the future success of his children.

10:00.285 --> 10:01.703
Our success.

10:03.587 --> 10:05.062
Yeah.

10:14.804 --> 10:17.148
Well, it's bad luck if you
toast and don't drink it.

10:17.430 --> 10:20.349
Well, this you might
not actually believe,

10:20.374 --> 10:23.242
but, well, I've givin' it up.

10:24.558 --> 10:27.203
- You?
- I know, I know, it's...

10:27.228 --> 10:29.312
Well, it just got to be where...

10:29.726 --> 10:32.478
I wasn't very gentlemanly when I drank.

10:32.503 --> 10:34.503
And then it stopped being pleasant.

10:34.528 --> 10:35.851
So I stopped.

10:35.876 --> 10:38.855
And honestly, I've been
better for it ever since.

10:39.727 --> 10:41.979
I don't suppose you have
any apple juice in there?

10:42.004 --> 10:44.082
Apple juice is bad luck, too.

10:51.454 --> 10:52.538
I...

10:54.428 --> 10:57.215
Good for you, Remus.

10:58.512 --> 11:00.895
You've done something
our father never could.

11:02.311 --> 11:05.019
I'll just grab one of
these soda pops instead.

11:05.103 --> 11:07.601
But I don't mind, you go ahead,
indulge yourself.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.251
You've earned it.

11:11.949 --> 11:16.473
It's... It's no fun when you're
the only one drinking, so...

11:23.353 --> 11:24.637
Whoo.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.578
Ya know, this actually...

11:29.603 --> 11:32.228
This actually reminds me, I, uh,

11:32.253 --> 11:34.670
saw a volcano up close once.

11:35.020 --> 11:36.770
Kind of unimpressive, actually.

11:36.795 --> 11:38.536
Will you show me how that works?

11:38.561 --> 11:42.370
Well, ya see,
it all comes down to magma...

11:42.395 --> 11:43.902
No, your pistol.

11:45.017 --> 11:46.684
Oh, my...

11:48.699 --> 11:52.066
Well, I didn't think you
cared for the shooting sports.

11:52.522 --> 11:54.230
Well, I don't.

11:54.353 --> 11:57.379
But I will be working the night desk.

11:57.730 --> 11:59.603
At first, at least.

11:59.926 --> 12:01.853
A woman alone out here?

12:02.375 --> 12:03.662
I was thinking it might be wise

12:03.687 --> 12:06.135
to invest in some personal protection.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.184
I think it's an excellent idea.

12:08.465 --> 12:09.851
Very mature.

12:09.876 --> 12:12.371
I'm proud of ya.

12:12.396 --> 12:14.036
Come here, follow me.

12:14.061 --> 12:15.770
I'll show ya a little something.

12:16.244 --> 12:18.270
Very important to have a firm grip.

12:18.295 --> 12:20.573
Firm, but not too tight.

12:20.598 --> 12:23.152
Think of it as an extension of your arm.

12:24.004 --> 12:25.895
Get a handle on it.

12:26.449 --> 12:28.332
You take dead aim....

12:31.827 --> 12:33.618
Got ya, bastard.

12:36.144 --> 12:38.603
Also: control.

12:38.887 --> 12:40.853
Control is very important.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.186
Yeah, feel the weight of it.
That's good.

12:43.535 --> 12:45.895
Gotta maintain a sense of control,

12:45.920 --> 12:47.920
and also have an objective.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.715
Pick a target...

12:52.770 --> 12:56.662
and, maybe most importantly,
take dead aim, and then...

12:58.031 --> 12:59.031
Ohh.

13:20.149 --> 13:24.232
I'd have just given
it to ya if you'd asked.

15:00.192 --> 15:03.776
_

15:03.955 --> 15:10.955
_

15:20.293 --> 15:21.660
Uhh!

15:34.782 --> 15:37.399
Oh, there she go.

15:37.722 --> 15:39.138
Ah!

15:40.133 --> 15:41.787
Ooh.

15:41.812 --> 15:43.603
That's all she wrote.

15:43.628 --> 15:45.485
Ah. Oh!

15:49.477 --> 15:50.954
Is that chicken?

15:53.488 --> 15:54.696
Yes.

15:58.126 --> 16:00.161
Mm, mm, mm!

16:00.186 --> 16:02.454
Yeah, I thought I smelled meat.

16:02.946 --> 16:05.391
Are you alone... sir?

16:06.899 --> 16:08.462
Yes.

16:08.812 --> 16:10.563
Are y'all alone?

16:13.286 --> 16:15.741
- Yes.
- Well, pardon me,

16:15.766 --> 16:16.985
aren't I sittin' here?

16:19.350 --> 16:21.851
Uh... Never mind.

16:22.695 --> 16:23.695
Mmm.

16:24.180 --> 16:26.468
Yeah, well, I'm just wanderin',

16:26.493 --> 16:29.019
ya know, seein' where I land,

16:29.044 --> 16:30.899
seein' who I land with.

16:32.329 --> 16:33.829
I don't know how long.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.110
Long time.

16:37.895 --> 16:41.601
Eventually I saw your fire,
which was thankful timin',

16:41.626 --> 16:44.436
'cause I didn't want to piss all
over my good shoes in the dark.

16:49.228 --> 16:51.524
Boyfriend's takin' ZZZ's, huh?

16:52.118 --> 16:53.853
Havin' a little nap?

16:57.186 --> 16:58.860
He's my brother.

17:00.158 --> 17:01.158
Oh.

17:01.770 --> 17:04.445
Well, forest air's good for sleepin'.

17:05.806 --> 17:07.118
Yeah.

17:07.144 --> 17:08.686
What's all this mess?

17:08.712 --> 17:10.376
Plantin' some beans up here?

17:10.931 --> 17:12.744
We're gonna build a hotel.

17:14.394 --> 17:18.078
Like a innkeep rentin'
rooms and so forth?

17:18.103 --> 17:20.604
Man, I been wanderin' so long,

17:20.628 --> 17:23.369
stayin' still sounds nice.

17:23.654 --> 17:25.993
The guests they come, guests they go,

17:26.019 --> 17:28.769
but here you are,
always on the other side of that.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.850
Huh.

17:33.019 --> 17:36.112
Mmm. That's delicious.
