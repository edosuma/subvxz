WEBVTT

00:03.270 --> 00:05.337
(Child crying, dogs barking)

00:07.708 --> 00:10.609
(Child continues crying)

00:10.611 --> 00:12.211
Anybody got a spare ampicillin?

00:12.213 --> 00:14.346
Yeah.
How can we be

00:14.348 --> 00:16.382
out of gauze?
We're not.
Check my duffel.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.317
Thank you.
You got it.

00:18.319 --> 00:19.718
And how long
has she had the rash?

00:19.720 --> 00:23.655
(Speaking juba arabic)

00:23.657 --> 00:25.624
She say itching start four days.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.326
Lizzie, you are a lifesaver.

00:27.328 --> 00:30.229
Yeah, right. Not lately.

00:30.231 --> 00:33.232
(Child crying)
Kidding, bahar.
Tell zayah she'll be fine.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.334
It's infected, but we've got
medicine that'll help.

00:35.336 --> 00:39.238
(Women speaking juba arabic)

00:39.240 --> 00:40.672
Dave, I don't suppose
we can expect

00:40.674 --> 00:42.474
the lights back on
any time soon?

00:42.476 --> 00:44.810
Not unless you stashed a new
generator in your duffel, too.

00:44.812 --> 00:47.679
Oh, well, then where would
i keep all my extra gauze?

00:47.681 --> 00:49.748
(Vehicle approaching)
I knew I underpacked.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.550
(Vehicle doors closing,
men shouting)

00:51.552 --> 00:54.386
(Rapid gunfire)
Everybody down!

00:54.388 --> 00:56.155
(Panicked screams, shouts)

00:56.157 --> 00:57.790
Lizzie:
Medical to NCIS.

00:57.792 --> 00:59.658
Stan, can you hear me?!
It's Liz. I...

00:59.660 --> 01:02.094
I am in togu, south Sudan!

01:02.096 --> 01:03.595
Mayday! Mayday!

01:03.597 --> 01:05.631
Stan, send help!

01:05.633 --> 01:07.733
Send help! Help us!

01:39.433 --> 01:41.166
I honestly haven't
noticed, McGee.

01:41.168 --> 01:42.568
He seems the
same to me.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.203
He's not,
I'm telling you.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.638
Hey, bishop,
have you noticed...?

01:46.640 --> 01:49.608
Hey, uh, I've got
to get to work.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.678
Yes, they are.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.646
Okay.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.715
Love you.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.450
Jake?

01:59.720 --> 02:02.321
Jake says hi.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.590
How is tropical storm
Jake this morning?

02:04.592 --> 02:06.859
Tropical storm?
Yeah, as in

02:06.861 --> 02:09.161
unpredictable, given
your daily forecasts

02:09.163 --> 02:11.830
since he cheated
death in Dubai.
Well,

02:11.832 --> 02:13.532
today I'd say
Jake is more partly sunny

02:13.534 --> 02:14.867
with a slight chance of rain.

02:14.869 --> 02:16.802
And you with no umbrella.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.837
Bishop, have you not noticed

02:18.839 --> 02:20.439
how extra quiet
Gibbs has been lately?

02:20.441 --> 02:21.573
See, he's on about this.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.342
I don't agree with you.
Lately?

02:23.344 --> 02:24.810
Thank you.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.446
When you normally get two words,
now you get just one.

02:27.448 --> 02:28.747
I'm telling you,
something's up.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.716
Now that you mention it,
i guess,

02:30.718 --> 02:33.285
yeah, he didn't say a word
in yesterday's interrogation.

02:33.287 --> 02:35.220
Just a bunch of
grunts and shrugs.

02:35.222 --> 02:37.189
Grunts and shrugs
that had the bad guy

02:37.191 --> 02:38.824
confessing
from a fetal position?

02:38.826 --> 02:40.692
Ixnay.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.427
Morning, boss.
Hey, Gibbs!

02:42.429 --> 02:44.930
Beautiful Autumn morning.
Looking wonderful in that suit.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.169
And there you have it.

02:50.171 --> 02:52.204
Point, a shrug, no grunt.

02:52.206 --> 02:54.740
The man has not changed.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.241
I'm glad I could reach you guys.

02:56.243 --> 02:57.643
Tony:
It's been a long time, Stan.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.211
I'd ask how
you're doing, but...

02:59.213 --> 03:01.513
Yeah, not-not great.
I'm in south Sudan.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.183
Little village called togu.
McGee:
And what brings you there?

03:04.185 --> 03:05.784
Been stationed at camp lemonnier

03:05.786 --> 03:07.686
in Djibouti
for the last several months.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.656
And I got a mayday call
last night from a good friend.

03:10.658 --> 03:13.258
Navy doctor,
lieutenant Liz cortland.

03:13.260 --> 03:16.929
She okay?
I found her right...
Right there.

03:16.931 --> 03:19.665
Along with, uh...

03:19.667 --> 03:21.833
Along with two others
in the back room.

03:21.835 --> 03:24.469
I already sent the bodies
to you guys on a rush

03:24.471 --> 03:26.538
for ducky to autopsy.
Who are the other two?

03:26.540 --> 03:29.541
I can't ID them here, Gibbs.
They were all burned up.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.978
Look, if I can... if I can find
some paperwork in all this mess,

03:32.980 --> 03:36.548
there should be a list of
doctors that idg sent over here.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.849
Idg, agent burley?

03:37.851 --> 03:39.685
International doctors group.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.486
It's kind of a doctors without
borders-type outfit

03:41.488 --> 03:43.555
based out of DC
that Liz had been

03:43.557 --> 03:45.224
volunteering with for a while.

03:45.226 --> 03:46.858
We'll find it
and head over.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.894
I'd appreciate it. See what
they know about all this.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.429
And I'm, uh... I'm gonna see

03:50.431 --> 03:52.297
what I can get
out of the locals.

03:52.299 --> 03:54.333
Hang in there, Stan.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.834
You need anything else
right now?

03:55.836 --> 03:57.302
How about a time machine?

03:57.304 --> 03:59.538
Burley out.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.442
Idg. Please hold.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.776
She's gonna have
to call you back.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.845
Yes, we need
to cancel all of those.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.647
(Phones ringing)
Yes, can I help you?

04:08.649 --> 04:11.383
Tony:
NCIS special agents
DiNozzo and bishop.

04:11.385 --> 04:14.253
We'd like to speak
with Dr. woods.

04:14.255 --> 04:16.388
Is this about togu?
Bishop:
It is, yes.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.423
There are two Dr. woods listed
as founders here.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.292
Is either one of them available?

04:20.294 --> 04:23.262
I'll see.
It's a really bad time.

04:23.264 --> 04:26.398
Thank you.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.734
Wonder what constitutes a good
time at a place like this?

04:28.736 --> 04:30.269
What do you mean?

04:30.271 --> 04:31.970
Places like this
do so much good in the world.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.739
Of course they do, bishop.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.674
I'm just saying, being
a doctor's hard enough.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.409
What kind of doctor
would sign up

04:37.411 --> 04:39.278
to get dropped
into a war zone?

04:39.280 --> 04:42.414
A very noble one.
Or a crazy one.
I'm just saying.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.449
When we get dropped into a war
zone, might have a gun, so...

04:44.451 --> 04:45.817
Excuse me, you know
something about togu?

04:45.819 --> 04:48.420
Who did you
say you were?

04:55.796 --> 04:57.562
Jeanne.

04:59.033 --> 05:00.932
Tony.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.410
It's been a long time.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.545
Very.

05:13.547 --> 05:16.682
What can you tell us
about togu?

05:16.684 --> 05:18.083
What?

05:18.085 --> 05:19.818
Oh.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.587
We sent five volunteers
there last month.

05:22.589 --> 05:24.423
We were in contact every
day until yesterday

05:24.425 --> 05:26.425
when we received
this 911 text.

05:26.427 --> 05:27.993
We haven't heard
from anyone since.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.594
We've reached out to other
relief organizations,

05:29.596 --> 05:32.331
and what passes for law
enforcement over there,

05:32.333 --> 05:33.598
but no one's getting back to us.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.334
Just 911? Nothing else?

05:35.336 --> 05:37.703
We only use it in emergencies,
and it's never good,

05:37.705 --> 05:39.738
especially in south Sudan.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.574
What do you know about all this?

05:42.576 --> 05:43.942
We know
there's been an attack,

05:43.944 --> 05:45.844
and, unfortunately,
some fatalities.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.813
Who?

05:47.815 --> 05:49.614
Three are confirmed dead.

05:49.616 --> 05:51.950
Navy lieutenant
Elizabeth cortland.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.419
Lizzie?
Two more we have
yet to identify.

05:54.421 --> 05:55.954
What do you mean
"yet to identify"?

05:55.956 --> 05:57.589
Is David one of them?

05:57.591 --> 06:00.025
Who's David?
My husband.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.694
Dr. David woods.
He's the team leader.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.830
Bishop:
Uh, we don't know at this point.

06:04.832 --> 06:07.399
The bodies are en route
to NCIS now.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.800
(Line ringing)
You sent five
volunteers, Jeanne.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.836
Chances are good...
Well, then where is he?

06:10.838 --> 06:13.739
The chances are two-in-five,
and he isn't picking up!

06:13.741 --> 06:16.041
We'll need any names or
information you have on them.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.744
Rose, can you help them
with this?

06:18.746 --> 06:20.746
Yes, Dr. woods.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.147
I'll pull them up.

06:22.149 --> 06:25.050
Jeanne benoit? Really?

06:25.052 --> 06:27.519
Oh, wow.
All I got out
of Tony was

06:27.521 --> 06:30.155
"good friends,"
but I know there's more.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.090
Oh, there's more, believe me.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.693
There's so much more, I don't
even know where to start.

06:34.695 --> 06:37.863
Just nutshell it.
Who is she?

06:37.865 --> 06:41.733
Okay. Jeanne is...
Was...

06:41.735 --> 06:44.669
The daughter of an arms dealer
named la grenouille.

06:44.671 --> 06:47.773
Now, she didn't know that
her father was an arms dealer,

06:47.775 --> 06:49.775
and he's dead now,
but back then, he was alive.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.109
And Jenny Shepard--

06:51.111 --> 06:52.611
she's the director

06:52.613 --> 06:54.146
we had before Vance-- came in.

06:54.148 --> 06:56.515
Jenny Shepard sent Tony
to date Jeanne

06:56.517 --> 06:58.150
as a way to gather intel.

06:58.152 --> 07:00.652
Wait. Forget nutshelling.
Just bottom-line it for me?

07:00.654 --> 07:02.754
Bottom line is,
Tony got too close.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.589
He fell pretty hard for Jeanne,

07:04.591 --> 07:06.458
and apparently, it was mutual.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.760
It was definitely mutual.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.862
But the entire relationship
was built on a lie

07:10.864 --> 07:12.464
about who Tony was,

07:12.466 --> 07:13.899
so, it ended badly.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.468
And I mean super-beyond badly.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.537
Tony's hated himself ever since.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.871
He told you that?

07:19.873 --> 07:22.140
No, he doesn't have to.

07:22.142 --> 07:25.944
Anytime that you bring up Jeanne
with him, he won't discuss it.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.546
Not with me, not with anyone.

07:27.548 --> 07:28.947
Tony:
Nothing to discuss,

07:28.949 --> 07:30.215
mcgossip girl.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.950
Really, Tony? Jeanne benoit?

07:31.952 --> 07:34.085
So much
for old friends.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.521
Old friend,
girlfriends,

07:36.523 --> 07:38.089
whatever,
mcbishy-body.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.791
(Chuckles)

07:39.793 --> 07:41.827
You know how many I run
into on a regular basis?

07:41.829 --> 07:43.161
I saw your face, Tony.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.497
There was nothing
regular about it.

07:48.669 --> 07:51.670
The woman just lost friends

07:51.672 --> 07:53.772
and maybe a husband.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.607
And that is what
you saw on my face.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.042
She's married now?

07:57.044 --> 07:59.110
She's the other
Dr. woods.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.046
Okay, you know what?
You two have fun.

08:01.048 --> 08:03.114
I'm done talking about it.
Gibbs:
Not me.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.249
Update.

08:08.522 --> 08:11.256
Of the five medical
volunteers...
Stop.

08:11.258 --> 08:13.925
Jeanne benoit?

08:13.927 --> 08:15.994
Really?

08:15.996 --> 08:18.897
Go.

08:18.899 --> 08:22.601
...sent by idg into
togu last month,

08:22.603 --> 08:26.271
two are Navy. One dead--
lieutenant Elizabeth cortland.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.540
The other--
ensign joni Ryan.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.509
Both volunteer
when not on active duty.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.878
Dr. David woods,

08:32.880 --> 08:36.147
team leader and co-founder
of idg, along with his...

08:36.149 --> 08:38.049
Wife.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.085
She maintains
the headquarters,

08:40.087 --> 08:42.521
and she, of course,
is also a doctor.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.022
Why togu?

08:44.024 --> 08:45.824
McGee:
Village has zero
access to health care.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.192
About 100 miles away

08:47.194 --> 08:48.894
from the closest
thing to a city, juba.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.228
It's the capital
of south Sudan.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.797
Which became
an independent country in 2011,

08:52.799 --> 08:54.833
leaving a whole bunch
of ethnic groups

08:54.835 --> 08:57.235
to beat each other
bloody over territory.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.937
And burley's
in the middle of all of it.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.139
All right, you two,

09:01.141 --> 09:02.874
keeps these doctors'
families in the loop.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.643
McGee, you're with me.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.278
Burley:
<i> I wish I could say</i>
<i> I had more luck with</i>

09:06.280 --> 09:08.947
these villagers. The few that
are left are too afraid to talk.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.815
Well, we got a call
into special ops.

09:10.817 --> 09:12.284
We're gonna see if we can't
get you some backup, burley.

09:12.286 --> 09:13.985
I could really use it, Gibbs.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.087
And we're coming, too, burley.
We are?

09:16.089 --> 09:17.789
We got a missing
Navy officer.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.224
Get us two seats
on the first transport out.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.076
That's great, Gibbs.

09:21.077 --> 09:22.927
Just be sure you're up-to-date
on your vaccines.
(Phone rings)

09:22.930 --> 09:25.297
Boss, who exactly do you have
in mind for those seats?

09:25.299 --> 09:26.698
Yeah, on my way down, duck.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.667
Malaria, Tim. Seriously.

09:28.669 --> 09:31.336
Be sure.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.805
Angels on earth,
Mr. Palmer.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.741
Volunteers
who risk life and limb

09:36.743 --> 09:39.311
to help those in dire need
or in the worst

09:39.313 --> 09:41.780
possible conditions.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.249
"Humanitarian" is
a woefully inadequate word.

09:44.251 --> 09:47.152
Do I detect a hint of
pride in your voice, doctor?

09:47.154 --> 09:50.622
Yes, I'm very proud to have been
part of the first groups sent

09:50.624 --> 09:52.591
into biafra in 1971

09:52.593 --> 09:55.894
by the original
médecins sans frontières.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.829
Doctors without borders.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.732
Who do we have, duck?

10:00.734 --> 10:03.368
This is agent burley's friend,

10:03.370 --> 10:05.704
lieutenant cortland.

10:05.706 --> 10:09.908
And we're definitely going to
need dental x-rays, DNA samples.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.781
Boss.
What is it,
DiNozzo?

10:16.783 --> 10:17.782
Um...

10:17.784 --> 10:19.284
Ducky:
Jeanne benoit?

10:19.286 --> 10:22.253
Really?
Yes, really.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.789
Ducky. So, she's outside
the door, and she

10:24.791 --> 10:26.891
does not want to wait.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.033
Hello, agent Gibbs.

10:35.035 --> 10:38.870
Ducky:
Doctor, does your husband

10:38.872 --> 10:41.706
have any defining
characteristics?

10:41.708 --> 10:45.076
Uh, broken bones,
surgical scars?

10:45.078 --> 10:47.946
No surgeries, but he did break
his left collarbone

10:47.948 --> 10:50.015
skiing last winter.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.252
Well, still hard to say
without x-rays.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.888
Ducky:
Indeed. You get 'em started.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.657
What about braces?

10:58.659 --> 10:59.991
Did your husband
have orthodontia?

10:59.993 --> 11:01.860
No, David's teeth are...

11:03.296 --> 11:05.897
Oh, god. Felix.

11:05.899 --> 11:08.133
Dr. pitts wore braces.

11:08.135 --> 11:13.204
And this? Is your husband,
by any chance, an amputee?

11:13.206 --> 11:17.042
No, that's Dr. norm. James.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.711
He lost his leg during
the first Gulf war.

11:21.748 --> 11:25.050
And Liz.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.786
Oh, Lizzie,

11:27.788 --> 11:29.054
I'm so sorry.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.924
This just doesn't make
any sense.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.894
Warring tribes rarely
target outside doctors.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.796
If ever.
Tony:
Well, that's good news, right?

11:37.798 --> 11:39.197
For David
and the other volunteer?

11:39.199 --> 11:40.865
Joni?

11:40.867 --> 11:42.367
Then where are they?

11:45.338 --> 11:47.772
Doc?

11:47.774 --> 11:49.340
What are you doing here?

11:49.342 --> 11:51.710
Joni Ryan.
Is she alive?

11:51.712 --> 11:53.812
What?
Ensign joni Ryan.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.880
She's a surgical tech?
Is she in autopsy, or not?

11:55.882 --> 11:59.017
Uh... no. No, she's not.

11:59.019 --> 12:02.320
You're certain?
Well, yeah. Why? Is
she a friend of yours?

12:02.322 --> 12:04.155
A good one.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.191
We served together
on the<i> Daniel Webster.</i>

12:06.193 --> 12:08.793
Matter of fact,
she assisted on your surgery.

12:08.795 --> 12:11.196
(Beeping and whooshing)

12:11.198 --> 12:12.764
(Echoing):
You comfortable, agent Gibbs?

12:14.101 --> 12:15.900
Bishop:
Tony, you remember Dr. taft.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.102
Mm, the man, the myth,

12:17.104 --> 12:18.403
the legend.
Nice work, doc.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.072
Well, thank you.
Gibbs did his part.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.774
Not that he's done much since.

12:22.776 --> 12:25.810
Skips a lot of check-ups.
Busy.

12:25.812 --> 12:27.812
Are you Dr. cyril taft?

12:27.814 --> 12:29.914
Joni was recruiting you
for our relief mission.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.516
I'm Dr. woods.
We spoke on the phone.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.785
Oh. Hi. Um, of course.

12:33.787 --> 12:36.855
Your husband was leading
the trip, wasn't he?

12:36.857 --> 12:39.190
Is he all right?
We don't know.

12:39.192 --> 12:42.327
David woods and joni Ryan
are still unaccounted for.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.895
Gibbs:
Not for long.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.330
McGee?
McGee:
Secured some seats for us

12:45.332 --> 12:46.865
on a cargo plane headed

12:46.867 --> 12:48.867
for juba, south
Sudan in two hours?

12:48.869 --> 12:51.302
Okay. DiNozzo and I will meet up
with burley in south Sudan.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.271
McGee, you and bishop,
provide support from here.
Tony: Good to go, boss.

12:53.273 --> 12:57.375
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. South Sudan?
That's-that's rugged country for

12:57.377 --> 12:59.878
anybody, much less a guy
six months out of major surgery.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.479
Funny, I don't recall asking.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.114
Send me a postcard.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.250
What about me?

13:05.252 --> 13:07.418
I'm not staying.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.853
I can't help that.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.156
No room.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.825
Look, I've been
to south Sudan many times.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.260
I know the region, the people,

13:15.262 --> 13:17.028
the dialects
better than any of you.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.497
I'll fly myself there
whether you take me or not.

13:19.499 --> 13:20.899
Having an experienced doctor
come along

13:20.901 --> 13:22.567
could be
to your advantage, Gibbs.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.903
Tony: Might not hurt, boss.
McGee:
Plus, boss, it is a cargo plane.

13:24.905 --> 13:27.272
I mean, there's plenty
of seats.
Okay, fine!

13:27.274 --> 13:29.307
Fine. Book her a seat.

13:29.309 --> 13:33.111
It's okay. You can come.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.380
Just make sure that...

13:36.983 --> 13:38.449
McGee (Distantly):
Boss?

13:38.451 --> 13:40.919
Gibbs?
Just-just... just as...

13:40.921 --> 13:43.021
Gibbs? Gibbs?!

13:43.023 --> 13:45.123
Gibbs, look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.060
Call 911!

13:49.062 --> 13:51.362
Gibbs, look at me.
Look at me.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.897
Bishop:
We need an ambulance...

14:02.909 --> 14:04.943
I know you dig
the sporty gown, Gibbs.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.078
There's no need to keep pulling
stunts like this to get one.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.947
Just get me unhooked
so I can get out of here.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.482
Maybe. After a few more tests.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.284
(Sighs)

14:13.286 --> 14:16.221
You know, I was fine
until you showed up.
Oh, is that right?

14:16.223 --> 14:18.022
Uh, 'cause your
team seem to think

14:18.024 --> 14:20.225
that you've been a
little too quiet lately.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.427
Like John Wayne
biting-the-bullet quiet.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.362
So?

14:24.364 --> 14:26.097
So, I called
director Vance

14:26.099 --> 14:27.899
at his conference
in Geneva,

14:27.901 --> 14:31.970
and he has agreed to put you
on limited duty from home.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.238
Pending my discretion.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.139
Where's my phone?

14:35.141 --> 14:36.641
Mm, you can call,
but he won't budge.

14:36.643 --> 14:39.410
Does he know about south Sudan?

14:39.412 --> 14:42.280
Does he know about
your missing friend?

14:42.282 --> 14:44.315
We want Ryan found,

14:44.317 --> 14:46.117
but right now,
you're in no condition.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.452
(Curtain sliding open)

14:47.454 --> 14:49.320
You forget about
south Sudan, mister.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.489
You're not going
anywhere.
Abby...

14:51.491 --> 14:53.024
Don't "Abby" me.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.193
You collapsed in the
squad room, Gibbs.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.629
What part of that is okay
with you?
Were you there?

14:57.631 --> 14:59.464
I did not collapse.

14:59.466 --> 15:02.967
Yeah, you kind
of did, Gibbs.
Aw, swell.

15:02.969 --> 15:05.303
Where-where's DiNozzo?
Where-where's McGee?

15:05.305 --> 15:07.538
Let's bring the whole gang
in here.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.941
Actually, they're... somewhere
over the Atlantic about now.

15:09.943 --> 15:12.343
What?!

15:12.345 --> 15:14.979
Next flight to south Sudan
wasn't for another two days,

15:14.981 --> 15:17.482
so they made
an executive decision, knowing

15:17.484 --> 15:19.150
that you were
in good hands.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.119
Abby:
So<i> you</i>

15:21.121 --> 15:25.089
listen to Dr. taft and let them
worry about burley

15:25.091 --> 15:26.424
and...

15:26.426 --> 15:28.593
Jeanne benoit. Really?

15:30.430 --> 15:31.696
Wow.

15:31.698 --> 15:34.032
Tony:
<i> Thanks.</i>

15:34.034 --> 15:36.434
They say Gibbs
is recovering.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.970
He's in recovery.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.371
How crazy was that?

15:40.373 --> 15:42.607
How crazy is this?

15:45.045 --> 15:47.712
So, when are you
gonna go talk to her?

15:47.714 --> 15:50.181
(Sighs)

15:50.183 --> 15:53.117
There's nothing
to talk about.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.722
I'm sorry about what happened,

15:57.724 --> 16:00.191
(whispering):
But I was doing my job.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.659
That's it.

16:04.331 --> 16:07.532
Of course it bothered me
that I lied to her.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.035
I was in love with her.

16:11.037 --> 16:13.972
But it was a long time ago,
and her husband is missing,

16:13.974 --> 16:16.407
and there's nothing
to talk about.

16:18.044 --> 16:20.078
So when are you gonna
go talk to her?

16:20.080 --> 16:22.447
(Sighs)

16:24.718 --> 16:28.252
Hey. They just told
me Gibbs is, uh...

16:28.254 --> 16:30.388
I heard. Good news.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.498
So, how did you meet--
you and David?

16:40.500 --> 16:45.603
I had just finished
a six-month fellowship in Gabon.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.205
Oh, right.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.639
I remember that.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.175
It was around the
last time we spoke.

16:52.779 --> 16:56.080
I'm sorry you got caught
in the middle of all this.
Was any of it real?

16:57.751 --> 16:59.684
No.

17:04.290 --> 17:07.358
I wish I'd never met you.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.727
Right before, yeah.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.797
After that, I joined
doctors without borders.

17:12.799 --> 17:16.167
Spent a few years
in Indonesia, Bolivia,

17:16.169 --> 17:18.503
the Congo, and that's
where I met David.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.138
The Congo. Wow.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.472
There was a cholera
outbreak there.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.074
We helped stop it.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.243
Got married a year later.

17:25.245 --> 17:27.478
Started idg
a few months after that.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.648
It's impressive.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.584
Well, he sounds like
a... like a good man.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.654
The best I've ever known.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.060
Okay. Well...

17:42.062 --> 17:44.395
I, uh...

17:44.397 --> 17:46.364
(Sighs)

17:46.366 --> 17:49.367
I think we got about
ten more hours.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.769
I'm gonna grab a
little shut-eye.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.443
(Sighs)

17:58.445 --> 18:00.845
Thanks, McGee.
That was a good call.

18:04.818 --> 18:07.718
Morning, guys.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.454
Got your message.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.122
You've been
working all night?

18:11.124 --> 18:12.824
Yeah, yeah,
we kind of got on a roll.

18:12.826 --> 18:15.159
Any news of our patient?

18:15.161 --> 18:17.462
Dr. taft had him spend
the night for more tests.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.163
I know that.

18:19.165 --> 18:21.332
Jethro was not a happy
man when I spoke with him.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.201
I know he's overdoing it.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.136
Uh, is that all you needed?

18:25.138 --> 18:26.671
Not remotely.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.840
Causes of death
were as expected.

18:28.842 --> 18:31.709
High-caliber gunshot
wounds at close range.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.544
Jimmy:
That's not the weird part.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.313
Well, I prefer "intriguing."

18:35.315 --> 18:38.483
Come here. It's these

18:38.485 --> 18:42.220
posthumous puncture wounds
to each of the victims' feet.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.454
Punctured after they were dead?

18:43.456 --> 18:44.755
All three.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.357
But in the cases
of the other two doctors,

18:46.359 --> 18:47.892
before they were left
to burn in the back room.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.761
And since they were
delivered posthumously,

18:50.763 --> 18:53.898
one can assume that they may
have been ceremonial in nature.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.634
Jimmy:
Like some kind of
tradition or superstition

18:56.636 --> 18:59.237
that we could maybe link to a
specific tribe or ethnic group?

18:59.239 --> 19:01.372
Which could definitely help
Tony and McGee. Nice.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.307
I'm off to Abby.
I'll be happy to research

19:03.309 --> 19:05.710
African tribal traditions
for you, too, agent bishop.

19:05.712 --> 19:06.911
That'd be great, Jimmy.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.446
Thanks, but...

19:09.549 --> 19:11.782
Uh... for me?

19:11.784 --> 19:13.518
Eleanor, has it
not occurred to you

19:13.520 --> 19:15.253
that you are now running point?

19:15.255 --> 19:19.257
Well... maybe by default.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.192
Uh, only until Gibbs
gets back.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.661
(Phone ringing)

19:23.663 --> 19:26.664
Which might not be long.
Morning, Gibbs.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.933
Bishop, sitrep.
What's going on?

19:28.935 --> 19:30.935
Ducky found something that...
No, I didn't.

19:30.937 --> 19:34.172
There's nothing to report,
Jethro. Go take a nap.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.740
<i> You</i> take a nap.

19:35.742 --> 19:38.209
Why aren't McGee and DiNozzo
answering my calls?

19:38.211 --> 19:40.678
Bishop:
Well, their flight should be
landing just about now.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.614
No cell reception?
And it's not much better here.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.950
You're-you're breaking up,
Jethro.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.619
We'll call you
later. Bye!

19:52.192 --> 19:54.759
Burley:
<i> I know Gibbs reached out</i>
<i> to special ops to send backup,</i>

19:54.761 --> 19:57.328
but so far, you guys are it.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.330
We'll try to be
just as special.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.299
Jeanne:
Have you talked
to any village elders,

20:01.301 --> 20:02.633
agent burley?

20:02.635 --> 20:03.968
A man named abdel?

20:03.970 --> 20:05.703
His wife is minoo?

20:05.705 --> 20:07.738
No, if they've stayed,
i haven't seen them.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.440
There's not many
locals left.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.908
Where'd they all go?

20:10.910 --> 20:13.244
After the attack, most
ran off to a refugee camp

20:13.246 --> 20:15.880
in mambe. Others are
said to be hiding in the bush,

20:15.882 --> 20:17.848
wherever that is.
It's nowhere.

20:17.850 --> 20:21.385
"In the bush" means
a nomadic existence.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.587
Anywhere but here.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.488
Where is "here" exactly?

20:24.490 --> 20:25.990
It's a few more miles.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.925
There's not much there.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.530
(Knocking on door)

20:37.537 --> 20:38.669
You don't answer your phone?

20:39.772 --> 20:41.405
I didn't hear it.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.376
Right. Oh.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.478
What a lovely brunch.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.313
Very healthy.

20:49.315 --> 20:52.850
Look, I'm at home, doc,
doing what you said.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.352
Isn't that enough?

20:54.354 --> 20:56.254
Forgive me for caring.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.022
And you're right.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.624
It should be enough,

20:59.626 --> 21:02.593
since all your tests
turned out normal.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.662
Blood work, EKG,

21:04.664 --> 21:06.430
pet scan, cat scan,

21:06.432 --> 21:07.999
everywhere a man
can be scanned,

21:08.001 --> 21:10.568
you're humming
like a turbojet.
Okay then.

21:10.570 --> 21:12.303
Want to share the steak?

21:12.305 --> 21:14.572
I got to get to work.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.307
No, thanks.

21:16.309 --> 21:18.943
Uh, and no, you don't.

21:18.945 --> 21:22.680
Or rather, you can't... work.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.649
Not yet.
Why not?

21:24.651 --> 21:26.684
I saw you go down, Gibbs.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.586
You did collapse.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.421
The pain you felt
was very real,

21:30.423 --> 21:32.523
and it quite literally
knocked you on your ass.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.292
You just said
you didn't find anything.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.460
Which leads me to believe
that what you were experiencing

21:36.462 --> 21:37.895
was likely stress-related.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.563
A, uh... a physical
manifestation

21:39.565 --> 21:40.965
of an emotional
response.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.733
So you think this is in my head?

21:42.735 --> 21:44.435
Not exactly.

21:44.437 --> 21:47.538
"In your head" suggests
that you imagined it.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.841
It's more... cellular

21:50.843 --> 21:52.510
than that.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.545
It was real.
Cellular?

21:54.547 --> 21:56.580
Your body has a memory, Gibbs.

21:56.582 --> 21:59.083
And people who've been shot
and nearly died

21:59.085 --> 22:01.052
don't get to just
go on with their lives

22:01.054 --> 22:02.653
like nothing ever happened.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.556
You have to
talk about it.

22:05.558 --> 22:08.459
Go to therapy
or group counseling.

22:08.461 --> 22:09.894
Yeah.

22:11.597 --> 22:12.730
No.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.832
That's it?
"Yeah. No."?

22:14.834 --> 22:16.600
The only therapy I need
is my job.

22:16.602 --> 22:18.569
Mm, be sure to put that
on your tombstone.

22:18.571 --> 22:22.440
So you're not even
gonna entertain

22:22.442 --> 22:24.542
the possibility
that the psychological toll

22:24.544 --> 22:26.544
of what you went through might
be bigger than you're aware of?

22:26.546 --> 22:28.846
Or are willing to admit?

22:28.848 --> 22:30.781
Doc, do you want
some of this steak or not?

22:54.807 --> 22:57.608
I'm gonna take that as a no.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.677
People who've been shot
don't eat

22:59.679 --> 23:01.412
like nothing happened, either.

23:01.414 --> 23:04.849
As your doctor, I'm not gonna
watch you kill yourself.

23:08.621 --> 23:11.689
Burley:
<i> They molotoved what used to be</i>
<i> a room back there.</i>

23:11.691 --> 23:13.991
It's where I found
the other two bodies.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.826
And your friend Liz was here?

23:15.828 --> 23:18.662
Yeah.

23:18.664 --> 23:20.531
She, uh...

23:20.533 --> 23:23.601
She loved working with you guys.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.703
I seem to recall her

23:25.705 --> 23:27.838
saying nice things
about you, too.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.910
I'm gonna go take a look outside
for anyone I might know.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.479
Uh, I'm not sure
I'd recommend that.

23:35.481 --> 23:37.648
Yeah, I can't let you do that.
Excuse me?

23:37.650 --> 23:38.849
You're telling me I can't?

23:38.851 --> 23:41.018
I know you know your
way around here,

23:41.020 --> 23:43.421
but you're
my responsibility now.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.723
Well then maybe can go
take a look around together.

23:50.663 --> 23:51.896
Get away, do not touch me!

23:51.898 --> 23:52.997
Jeanne:
Don't shoot!

23:55.034 --> 23:56.967
I know her.

23:58.638 --> 24:01.639
I was here three years ago
with Dr. David.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.207
You were
much smaller then.

24:03.209 --> 24:06.477
Your mother--
her name is nefy.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.447
Nefy is dead.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.817
Like everyone.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.885
(Machete clatters)

24:18.057 --> 24:20.124
(Crying)

24:21.694 --> 24:24.762
I run when bad men come.

24:24.764 --> 24:27.765
Only come
back now.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.567
When I hear
voice, I hide.

24:29.569 --> 24:31.235
I do not know it is you.

24:31.237 --> 24:33.237
When the bad men
came, bahar,

24:33.239 --> 24:35.706
you were here?
I helping
Dr. Liz.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.174
No lights to see.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.243
She fight bad men
and they shoot.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.978
Shoot more, take others.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.112
They took David?

24:43.249 --> 24:45.683
Dr. David and joni--
they took them?

24:45.685 --> 24:48.786
Who took them--
what bad men?

24:48.788 --> 24:49.987
I do not know.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.922
Sure you do.

24:51.924 --> 24:53.657
What tribe, bahar?

24:53.659 --> 24:55.059
Was it the murle?

24:55.061 --> 24:56.861
Nuer?

24:56.863 --> 24:57.862
Azande?

24:57.864 --> 24:59.663
I do not know.

24:59.665 --> 25:00.998
We'll protect you, bahar.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.032
No.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.200
You leave.

25:03.202 --> 25:04.869
Always leave.

25:04.871 --> 25:06.604
We stay.

25:06.606 --> 25:09.006
They kill me for
talk to you.

25:09.008 --> 25:12.543
Like they maybe kill
Dr. David and joni by now.

25:13.746 --> 25:15.746
I'm sorry.

25:15.748 --> 25:17.281
You are too late.

25:17.283 --> 25:18.782
You go now.

25:18.784 --> 25:21.018
Is better for
you, you go.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.020
Better for me.

25:24.524 --> 25:26.090
It is too late.

25:38.004 --> 25:39.803
Hey, Jeanne,
let me give you a hand.

25:39.805 --> 25:41.939
No.

25:41.941 --> 25:45.309
Come on.
Hey...

25:45.311 --> 25:47.077
Hey, Jeanne...

25:47.079 --> 25:48.979
The symbol on this handle--

25:48.981 --> 25:50.848
any idea
what that means?

25:50.850 --> 25:52.816
No idea.

25:52.818 --> 25:53.984
It's not a local dialect.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.686
And there are a lot of them.

25:55.688 --> 25:56.921
Bahar said one of the bad men

25:56.923 --> 25:58.756
dropped it during the attack.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.291
Maybe Abby
can figure it out.

26:00.293 --> 26:02.593
(Vehicles approaching)

26:06.032 --> 26:07.698
Where's burley?

26:07.700 --> 26:09.199
He was outside.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.268
(Men shouting)

26:13.806 --> 26:16.073
It's okay. The cavalry
has arrived.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.641
Man:
I don't know about that.

26:17.643 --> 26:19.577
Commander Pete Grady,
seal team bravo.

26:19.579 --> 26:21.579
That's enough cavalry
for us.

26:21.581 --> 26:23.881
Your boss Gibbs must have some
friends in pretty high places

26:23.883 --> 26:26.016
or we would've
passed you folks right by.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.151
McGee:
So you know our situation.

26:27.153 --> 26:28.852
Grady:
Uh-huh.

26:28.854 --> 26:30.654
No sign of your missing doctors?

26:30.656 --> 26:32.623
Not yet.

26:32.625 --> 26:35.059
Planning on expanding
the search tomorrow morning.

26:35.061 --> 26:37.795
McGee: Now that you're here,
we'll gladly follow your lead.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.697
Yeah, well, you could
if we were staying, but, uh,

26:39.699 --> 26:41.865
unfortunately this is
just a courtesy call.

26:41.867 --> 26:43.867
We're headed to juba now
to be airlifted to Rwanda

26:43.869 --> 26:45.869
by morning.
Priority orders.

26:45.871 --> 26:49.039
Missing doctors
aren't a priority?

26:49.041 --> 26:50.874
Well, that's not my call, ma'am.
It's a very large continent

26:50.876 --> 26:52.276
and we're spread thin as it is.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.011
Now, if you can wait a
few days, we may be able

26:54.013 --> 26:55.713
to swing back around and
help you with your search.

26:55.715 --> 26:56.747
We don't have a couple days.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.148
Copy that.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.917
We'll secure the perimeter
before we go.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.987
Let's go.

27:02.989 --> 27:05.022
(Indistinct chatter)

27:05.024 --> 27:07.091
(Vehicle engines starting)

27:10.029 --> 27:11.729
Abby:
This is so something
Gibbs should know,

27:11.731 --> 27:13.063
but not in his condition.

27:13.065 --> 27:14.632
And I already
hung up on him once today,

27:14.634 --> 27:17.801
so I'm not telling him.
Tell me what?

27:17.803 --> 27:19.637
Gibbs?
What are you doing here?

27:19.639 --> 27:20.904
No, no, no.

27:20.906 --> 27:22.172
You can't be here.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.774
You looked terrible
yesterday.

27:23.776 --> 27:27.044
Well, today I got
a clean bill of health.

27:27.046 --> 27:28.779
What can I say?

27:28.781 --> 27:30.347
Uh, hey, listen,
about that phone call...

27:30.349 --> 27:32.049
What was it
you didn't want to tell me?

27:32.051 --> 27:36.320
Um, the seals-- they
got sent elsewhere.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.322
Our guys are getting
no love in south Sudan.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.424
Nice triglycerides,
by the way.

27:40.426 --> 27:42.359
Yeah, I heard
all about the seals.
Heard how?

27:42.361 --> 27:43.927
What's with the machete?

27:43.929 --> 27:45.863
McGee sent it
a little while ago.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.398
It was used
in the attack, though

27:47.400 --> 27:49.099
it doesn't match
the puncture wounds

27:49.101 --> 27:51.101
in any of the victims' feet.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.203
Puncture wounds?

27:53.205 --> 27:55.039
Yeah, and each wound

27:55.041 --> 27:58.008
contained a dose
of diamphotoxin.

27:58.010 --> 28:01.245
It's an organic poison
derived from beetle larvae.

28:01.247 --> 28:04.915
Bishop:
Once commonly used for hunting
by African bushmen, it's now

28:04.917 --> 28:06.083
considered
pretty old-school.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.317
Abby:
And if we could find

28:07.319 --> 28:08.819
the old-school tribe
that likes to

28:08.821 --> 28:10.788
poison their victims
after they're dead,

28:10.790 --> 28:12.923
then it would probably point
to who took our doctors.

28:12.925 --> 28:14.224
Hey, any luck
with that, Jimmy?

28:15.961 --> 28:17.995
Agent Gibbs, welcome back.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.129
(Quietly):
Should I not be talking to him?

28:19.131 --> 28:21.065
He's fine. Look.

28:21.067 --> 28:23.267
Nice triglycerides.

28:23.269 --> 28:24.334
Any luck with what?

28:24.336 --> 28:25.903
Uh, beetle-larvae poison.

28:25.905 --> 28:27.871
And no luck yet.
It's nearly impossible

28:27.873 --> 28:29.339
to trace it to a specific tribe.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.041
Did you know that
there are over

28:31.043 --> 28:32.843
60 indigenous ethnic
groups in south Sudan?

28:32.845 --> 28:34.111
Over 80 different dialects?

28:34.113 --> 28:36.480
Keep digging.
I'll be back.

28:39.385 --> 28:40.918
I'll bet he knew that.

28:47.993 --> 28:50.494
Hey.

28:50.496 --> 28:53.297
You okay?

28:56.802 --> 28:58.802
After I found out the truth

28:58.804 --> 29:01.505
about my father--

29:01.507 --> 29:03.373
and about you--

29:03.375 --> 29:05.509
all I could do was...

29:05.511 --> 29:09.213
Look for something
that made me feel good.

29:09.215 --> 29:12.750
And I found that in work.

29:12.752 --> 29:15.352
And in David.

29:15.354 --> 29:19.289
I know there's nothing
i could ever say or do...

29:19.291 --> 29:22.292
To make you forgive me.

29:27.032 --> 29:29.233
I won't rest until we find him.

29:29.235 --> 29:31.301
You have my word.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.774
Ducky:
A doctor of taft's caliber

29:36.776 --> 29:39.042
would at the very least
have prescribed

29:39.044 --> 29:41.545
a day of bed rest
following a collapse.

29:41.547 --> 29:43.180
I didn't collapse, duck.

29:43.182 --> 29:44.782
Anything else
about the case or not?

29:44.784 --> 29:47.050
Yes, this
lieutenant cortland

29:47.052 --> 29:50.053
reminds me of a young nurse
i met in biafra.

29:50.055 --> 29:51.789
Her name was Claire.

29:51.791 --> 29:53.557
As I recall,
she had a difficult home life,

29:53.559 --> 29:56.794
from which
she required distance.

29:56.796 --> 29:58.796
Helping those in need

29:58.798 --> 30:00.564
provided that distance.

30:00.566 --> 30:03.300
None of us is immune, Jethro.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.202
We're all running

30:05.204 --> 30:08.939
to or from something
at various times in our lives.

30:08.941 --> 30:11.341
But no matter your speed,

30:11.343 --> 30:15.379
the truth is always
just that bit faster.

30:19.051 --> 30:21.285
Gibbs, Gibbs,
i think we have it.

30:21.287 --> 30:23.086
Tell me what you got.

30:23.088 --> 30:25.889
The tribe that took the doctors.

30:25.891 --> 30:28.158
It's the engraving
on the machete handle.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.028
Jimmy:
Uh, the dialect is juba arabic.
That's one of five dialects

30:31.030 --> 30:32.830
used by
the shilluk ethnic tribe.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.198
Well, however you pronounce it,

30:34.200 --> 30:35.566
this roughly translates

30:35.568 --> 30:37.301
to "ferocious animal."

30:37.303 --> 30:38.602
Which is interesting,
because the shilluk

30:38.604 --> 30:40.237
are generally
a peaceful people,

30:40.239 --> 30:41.872
known mostly
for their cattle herding.

30:41.874 --> 30:44.374
Abby: Except there's these
old-school shilluks

30:44.376 --> 30:47.511
that have this odd custom of
poisoning the feet of their dead

30:47.513 --> 30:49.313
so they can't walk the earth
again like zombies.

30:49.315 --> 30:51.415
I mean,
how crazy is that?

30:51.417 --> 30:53.150
And the tribal infighting
over there has created

30:53.152 --> 30:55.919
several violent subgroups
of shilluk, one of which

30:55.921 --> 30:57.387
is led by...

30:57.389 --> 30:59.990
Abby:
General ajak gadet.

30:59.992 --> 31:03.393
He likes to refer to himself
as ferocious animal.

31:03.395 --> 31:05.929
He's got a small rebel army of
outcasts with no home village.

31:05.931 --> 31:08.031
Though bishop's been trying
to find their last location.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.467
Which I think I have,

31:10.469 --> 31:12.035
and something more.

31:12.037 --> 31:14.404
So according
to NSA intel,

31:14.406 --> 31:17.140
general gadet was critically
injured just three days ago

31:17.142 --> 31:18.408
in a battle
with a rival ethnic group,

31:18.410 --> 31:20.177
the tunjur people.

31:20.179 --> 31:24.281
Did the shilluks take our
doctors to save their general?

31:24.283 --> 31:26.583
This general's earned his
nickname, and his soldiers

31:26.585 --> 31:29.052
have a pretty ferocious
track record themselves.

31:29.054 --> 31:30.220
Location?
After the battle,

31:30.222 --> 31:31.922
the shilluk
reportedly escaped

31:31.924 --> 31:33.156
to a village
called lenka,

31:33.158 --> 31:35.025
about 40 miles east of togu.

31:35.027 --> 31:36.426
Tell DiNozzo and McGee.
Call 'em.

31:36.428 --> 31:37.561
Where you going, Gibbs?

31:37.563 --> 31:39.496
Tell 'em.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.667
Gibbs:
Hey, let me call you back.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.502
(Phone beeps off)

31:47.373 --> 31:49.439
Oh, no.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.475
Is it ensign Ryan?

31:51.477 --> 31:53.410
No. No, we're still looking.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.179
I wanted to ask you
something, though, doc, um,

31:56.181 --> 31:57.981
kind of personal.
It's about your son.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.318
If that's all right.

32:03.188 --> 32:04.521
Paul.

32:04.523 --> 32:09.059
His name was Paul.

32:09.061 --> 32:11.295
So, uh...

32:11.297 --> 32:13.363
When you lost Paul,

32:13.365 --> 32:16.166
doc, did you go
right back to work

32:16.168 --> 32:19.069
on the hospital ship?

32:19.071 --> 32:22.539
Uh, not right back.
Uh, it was, uh...

32:22.541 --> 32:25.275
After almost a year.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.644
And lots of talk.

32:27.646 --> 32:29.513
My tests results--

32:29.515 --> 32:32.516
you're sure they're right.

32:32.518 --> 32:35.552
Right? I mean, I'm good?

32:35.554 --> 32:37.688
Are you thinking that
maybe you're not?

32:37.690 --> 32:40.257
No. No, I don't know...

32:40.259 --> 32:43.994
I'm thinking, um...

32:43.996 --> 32:46.463
If, uh, talking...

32:46.465 --> 32:48.598
Helps...

32:50.369 --> 32:51.635
Why not?

32:51.637 --> 32:53.236
Good.

32:53.238 --> 32:54.471
Great. Uh...

32:54.473 --> 32:56.373
Really, Gibbs, uh...

32:56.375 --> 32:57.741
You know, I know
a very good therapist...

32:57.743 --> 33:00.210
No. No, I, uh...
Not...

33:00.212 --> 33:02.512
Not that.
I... I'll talk.

33:02.514 --> 33:04.982
I don't need my head examined.

33:04.984 --> 33:06.516
Oh, no. Uh...

33:06.518 --> 33:08.118
Perish the thought.

33:08.120 --> 33:11.088
(Chuckles)

33:11.090 --> 33:13.724
In which case, that leaves...

33:15.094 --> 33:16.727
...me?

33:19.531 --> 33:22.132
Burley:
After my fiancée split,
there was...

33:22.134 --> 33:23.567
There was Liz.

33:23.569 --> 33:27.404
We could only get together
every few months.

33:27.406 --> 33:29.706
I should've made
more of an effort.

33:29.708 --> 33:31.541
You know, guys like us, Tony,

33:31.543 --> 33:33.677
we can't play the field
forever, you know.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.278
I'm not really
playing the field, Stan.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.680
Like your
friend here.

33:36.682 --> 33:40.017
This one? You know,
Liz had that same spark.

33:40.019 --> 33:42.219
And I never
told her enough

33:42.221 --> 33:44.221
how I felt.

33:44.223 --> 33:45.455
This husband we're looking for,

33:45.457 --> 33:47.557
he knew he had a gem
and he jumped.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.226
He's a smart man.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.164
Could that be
what I think it is?

34:08.347 --> 34:10.814
Gadet's men were here,
all right.
Yeah,

34:10.816 --> 34:12.682
leaving scorched
earth in their wake.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.618
Literally.

34:17.523 --> 34:20.757
(Dog whimpering, barks)

34:20.759 --> 34:23.093
This has to be one of ours.

34:23.095 --> 34:25.162
David was here.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.098
It might be a message.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.234
I think the message is
they're still alive.

34:32.471 --> 34:34.704
So we keep looking.

34:49.121 --> 34:51.655
Bishop:
McGee sent them an
hour after you left.

34:51.657 --> 34:53.790
He and Tony
are sure the shilluk

34:53.792 --> 34:55.525
were with
the missing doctors, but

34:55.527 --> 34:57.461
there's nothing to indicate
where they went next.

34:57.463 --> 34:58.528
What are they running from?

34:58.530 --> 35:00.664
Who-- the shilluk?

35:00.666 --> 35:03.600
Well, they shot up one village,
they burned down another.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.136
They left nothing behind
for whoever's trailing them.

35:06.138 --> 35:07.404
We're the only ones
trailing them.

35:07.406 --> 35:09.172
Yeah, but they
don't know that.

35:11.477 --> 35:14.244
Who-who was it that
wounded their general?

35:14.246 --> 35:15.545
What tribe? Where?

35:15.547 --> 35:17.547
It was a firefight
with the tunjur

35:17.549 --> 35:20.784
in a village called kala, about
60 miles southeast of togu.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.687
Okay, so they take doctors
to save their general.

35:23.689 --> 35:25.555
And they keep moving.
They go from here

35:25.557 --> 35:30.127
to here.
And now to here.

35:30.129 --> 35:32.429
I'm starting to wonder
if bahar was right.

35:32.431 --> 35:34.865
What if we are too late?
What if they're already dead?

35:34.867 --> 35:36.867
No. They're not dead. Look,

35:36.869 --> 35:39.569
the glove means
they're still alive.

35:39.571 --> 35:41.505
They're alive
as long as they're useful.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.375
Sorry, that kind of
came out wrong.

35:45.377 --> 35:48.311
At least you're being honest.

35:48.313 --> 35:50.747
It's your DC office.
Special agent burley.

35:50.749 --> 35:53.350
Gibbs:
Talk to me, burley.
Boss, you're back?

35:53.352 --> 35:56.186
You still in lenka?
We are, Gibbs.
Did you hear about the seals?

35:56.188 --> 35:58.221
Yeah, I'm working on that.
Right now it's time for you to

35:58.223 --> 36:00.790
move on.
We're ready to move on, we just
don't know where to move to.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.492
There's a town called pehtok

36:02.494 --> 36:04.594
about 35 klicks northwest.

36:04.596 --> 36:05.762
It's barely a town.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.330
And you sure the
shilluk are there?

36:07.332 --> 36:09.199
Got a feeling.
I'll explain later.

36:09.201 --> 36:11.535
He's got a feeling?
Never doubt the Gibbs gut.

36:11.537 --> 36:12.669
Burley:
We'll leave right away, Gibbs.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.671
We'll be watching.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.740
It may take some time
to get a satellite link.

36:16.742 --> 36:18.475
How much time?
They're leaving now.

36:18.477 --> 36:20.210
(Line ringing)
In that case, I'll be back.

36:20.212 --> 36:23.947
Come on, come on, come on,
come on. Pick up, pick up.

36:25.918 --> 36:28.485
(Men shouting in distance)

36:28.487 --> 36:30.587
(Man shouting)

36:33.759 --> 36:36.693
I love the smell
of pehtok in the fall.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.261
I count eight.

36:38.263 --> 36:40.397
Who knows how many more inside.

36:40.399 --> 36:41.965
This is suicide
without backup.

36:41.967 --> 36:43.500
Well, whatever Gibbs
is working on,

36:43.502 --> 36:44.634
now would be a good time.

36:44.636 --> 36:46.269
What are they doing?

36:46.271 --> 36:48.371
McGee:
Guessing that's the general.

36:48.373 --> 36:49.739
Looks like
he's still alive.

36:52.211 --> 36:53.677
(Truck engine starts)
Oh, my god, that's David.

36:53.679 --> 36:55.245
And joni.

37:00.552 --> 37:03.720
All right,
what do you say, guys?
Well, we've come this far.

37:03.722 --> 37:04.988
It's just us, isn't it?

37:09.528 --> 37:12.362
It seems to me a diversion never
hurts when you're outnumbered.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.931
You still a good shot, burley?

37:14.933 --> 37:16.466
Better than most. Why?

37:16.468 --> 37:18.602
Gas cans.

37:21.707 --> 37:23.506
(Ryan whimpering)

37:27.980 --> 37:29.713
You fix general.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.781
You fix him.
We will, we will, ramses.

37:31.783 --> 37:34.684
We've been fixing
him for days.

37:34.686 --> 37:35.952
He just...

37:35.954 --> 37:36.987
He needs more.

37:36.989 --> 37:38.588
No more. You fix.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.824
He needs surgery,
you understand?

37:40.826 --> 37:41.958
An operation.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.927
We need other instruments.

37:47.532 --> 37:48.732
(Grunts)

37:50.836 --> 37:53.436
He live or you die.

37:53.438 --> 37:55.572
(Gunshots)

37:55.574 --> 37:57.607
(Explosion)

37:58.577 --> 38:00.410
(Men shouting in juba arabic)

38:03.949 --> 38:05.782
(Speaking juba arabic)

38:11.823 --> 38:13.757
(Speaking juba arabic)

38:17.863 --> 38:19.729
All right. Keep going, move.
David: Where we going?

38:19.731 --> 38:21.031
Tony: Just keep moving,
keep going!

38:21.033 --> 38:23.833
(Speaks juba arabic)

38:23.835 --> 38:26.336
Talk to me, bishop.
I got them on satellite.

38:26.338 --> 38:28.471
It's not good.
They're in real trouble.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.340
Get in the Humvee.
Come on, keep moving!

38:30.342 --> 38:32.475
(Shouts in juba arabic)

38:32.477 --> 38:36.413
Come on, come on,
get there, get there.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.816
(Shouting)

38:44.690 --> 38:46.456
David!

38:55.767 --> 38:57.667
Grady: Continue to engage.
Admiral. Yes, sir.

38:57.669 --> 38:58.668
Cover for that Humvee.
We're watching now.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.103
All targets facing east.

39:00.105 --> 39:01.471
Perfect timing.

39:08.046 --> 39:10.113
Thank you, boss!

39:14.052 --> 39:15.852
(Indistinct radio transmission)

39:26.598 --> 39:30.567
This has got to be weird
for you on some level.

39:30.569 --> 39:33.570
Yeah.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.905
I think the word
is "totally surreal."

39:35.907 --> 39:37.507
All of it.

39:37.509 --> 39:39.976
The truly weird
part is...

39:39.978 --> 39:42.412
I'm happy for her.

39:42.414 --> 39:45.815
You should be happy
for yourself, too.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.917
You don't have to carry around
all that guilt anymore.

39:47.919 --> 39:49.486
Maybe.

39:49.488 --> 39:51.388
Maybe not.

40:04.169 --> 40:06.903
It's all been such a blur,

40:06.905 --> 40:08.872
I haven't had a chance
to say thank you.

40:08.874 --> 40:10.540
Yes, you have.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.609
And you're welcome.

40:17.582 --> 40:18.915
Thank you, Tony.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.884
I owe you.

40:20.886 --> 40:23.887
No, you don't.

40:23.889 --> 40:25.555
We're good.

40:47.012 --> 40:49.012
Taft:
Why do I concern myself

40:49.014 --> 40:50.980
with the health
of someone

40:50.982 --> 40:53.683
who does not even bother
to lock his door?

40:53.685 --> 40:56.219
Well, then quit
concerning yourself.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.955
Ensign Ryan sends her
undying gratitude.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.024
And I put a replacement steak
in your fridge.

41:01.026 --> 41:03.092
Nice New York strip, actually.

41:04.496 --> 41:05.562
Didn't have to do that.

41:05.564 --> 41:08.131
Yeah, I kind of did.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.033
Not only is your
cholesterol crazy low

41:10.035 --> 41:12.702
for your caveman diet,

41:12.704 --> 41:15.505
but I got some more of
your tests back today.

41:15.507 --> 41:17.707
Yeah, and?

41:19.110 --> 41:21.511
Turns out, uh, you have
a tiny patch of scar tissue

41:21.513 --> 41:22.912
in your chest cavity that

41:22.914 --> 41:25.148
just might be causing you
some discomfort.

41:25.150 --> 41:27.884
No bigger than
the size of a dime.

41:27.886 --> 41:30.186
Some people refer
to it as ghosting.

41:30.188 --> 41:33.056
A cough, a sneeze,
even the slightest aggravation

41:33.058 --> 41:35.859
can feel like you might
be having a heart attack.

41:37.529 --> 41:38.728
But it's not.

41:38.730 --> 41:40.096
So it's not in my head?

41:40.098 --> 41:41.798
Ah, I didn't
say that.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.801
No, this, uh,
will heal, eventually.

41:44.803 --> 41:47.604
The, uh, the scar tissue
will fade with time.

41:47.606 --> 41:49.873
But this-- the stress,

41:49.875 --> 41:52.942
the panic, the uncertainty?

41:52.944 --> 41:54.944
Yeah, that'll fade, too,
with time.

41:54.946 --> 41:56.846
And with talk.

41:56.848 --> 41:59.616
You're gonna start now?

41:59.618 --> 42:01.718
Doc, I'm right in the middle
of something here.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.620
What are you
afraid of, Gibbs?

42:03.622 --> 42:04.888
Nothing.

42:04.890 --> 42:05.955
Cut the crap.

42:05.957 --> 42:07.090
Life threw you

42:07.092 --> 42:08.825
a major-league
curve.

42:08.827 --> 42:11.594
You have a lot of support,
but at the end of the day,

42:11.596 --> 42:13.296
when your head
hits the pillow,

42:13.298 --> 42:14.697
it's just you.

42:14.699 --> 42:16.599
Admitting at
least that much

42:16.601 --> 42:17.967
might be half
the battle.

42:18.169 --> 42:20.103
Everybody's afraid of something.

42:22.307 --> 42:25.008
Even the great
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
