- [R& B] 
- [Shane] Hey.

01:04.385 --> 01:06.945
- Take a break.
- [Woman] Okay.

01:09.223 --> 01:11.783
You ready?

01:11.892 --> 01:14.554
Hey. Shh.

01:14.662 --> 01:17.222
- /s Cromo strapped?
- [Man] Let's find out.

01:17.331 --> 01:19.765
We'll let you take
the first round, sweetheart.

01:19.867 --> 01:22.427
[Woman]
Yeah, he got a gun, and it's loaded.

01:22.536 --> 01:24.163
How do you want
to do this, boss?

01:24.271 --> 01:26.831
- Cuff'em to something outside.
- Got it.

01:30.544 --> 01:32.978
Right here, ladies.

01:33.080 --> 01:35.640
[Woman Moaning]

01:35.750 --> 01:37.377
Yeah. Yeah.

01:37.485 --> 01:40.045
- [Moaning Continues]
- [Pager Beeping]

01:40.154 --> 01:42.645
[Man] This better be important,
stupid goddamn bitch.

01:42.757 --> 01:45.317
[Beeping Continues]

01:45.426 --> 01:48.088
It sure is, you stupid, goddamn bitch.
Let's go.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.254
Let's go. Hands on your head.
Behind your head.

01:50.364 --> 01:52.264
Right now. Come on, cornrow.
Let's go.

01:53.668 --> 01:55.465
You okay?

01:55.569 --> 01:57.764
Two minutes later, I would have
been doing a lot better.

01:57.872 --> 02:00.500
Raping a minor- Doesn't that
break some pimp code of ethics?

02:00.608 --> 02:02.576
Man, she bragged she was 18.

02:02.677 --> 02:06.443
- You see she wanted it. It's like a Kobe thing.
- Yeah?

02:06.547 --> 02:10.005
Well, it looks like you just lost
your endorsement deal.

02:10.116 --> 02:12.017
Let's go, Kobe.

02:12.119 --> 02:14.019
- What the hell happened, man?
- Oh, it's just a scrape.

02:14.121 --> 02:17.454
I'll be okay. Hey, I miss you
and your guys coming in here.

02:17.558 --> 02:20.652
I figured with all the free meals,
you'd be happy to get rid of us.

02:20.761 --> 02:23.958
/ need a favor. Remember Cyril,
the kid that works for me?

02:24.065 --> 02:26.761
Hasn't shown up in a couple of weeks
until this morning.

02:26.867 --> 02:28.926
- He ripped off your payroll?
- Yeah.

02:29.036 --> 02:31.561
/ tried to stop him.
He shoved me out of the way.

02:31.672 --> 02:34.869
- He only got 30 bucks.
- He a rockhead?

02:35.910 --> 02:37.810
Come on, Cal.

02:37.912 --> 02:40.938
Only one thing that turns a good kid
into a thief that fast.

02:41.048 --> 02:43.448
/ didn't want
to lead with that.

02:43.551 --> 02:46.520
I was afraid you wouldn't want
to help if you knew about the drugs.

02:46.620 --> 02:49.316
- Oh, and this one I should?
- I just thought maybe you could help me...

02:49.423 --> 02:51.323
put him on the straight.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.951
Excuse me.
There's a shipment here for you-

02:55.062 --> 02:56.962
a bunch of Polaroid cameras.

02:57.064 --> 02:59.430
Oh, uh, stack 'em
on that desk over there.

02:59.533 --> 03:02.934
- Danny, right?
- Yeah. We haven't officially met.

03:03.037 --> 03:05.005
Hi. Now we have.

03:05.106 --> 03:08.200
- /'m Monica Rawling.
- So, can I ask what the cameras are for?

03:08.309 --> 03:11.403
- David needs to push the transition meeting.
- Okay.

03:11.512 --> 03:14.208
I didn't see any paperwork
for cameras.

03:16.517 --> 03:18.417
You're leaving
with David, right?

03:18.519 --> 03:20.453
Of course. Why?

03:20.554 --> 03:22.818
No reason.

03:30.698 --> 03:32.598
What are you doing
in here?

03:32.700 --> 03:35.260
I'm, uh-

03:35.369 --> 03:39.305
Uh, our- Our men's room doesn't work.
We all share this one.

03:39.406 --> 03:43.672
- No, we don't.
- Yeah, we-we do. We ha-

03:47.214 --> 03:49.978
You mean we don't share it with you.
[Chuckles]

03:53.154 --> 03:55.054
Uh, there's somebody in there.

03:55.156 --> 03:57.784
Hey, Dutch-boy's been promoted
to bathroom monitor.

03:57.892 --> 04:00.918
- [Laughing]
- It's a shitty job, but someone's gotta do it.

04:01.028 --> 04:04.020
- [Cops Laughing]
- Big man-pass these out to the unis...

04:04.131 --> 04:06.031
17-year-old base chaser.

04:06.133 --> 04:08.829
Anybody sees him, call me.

04:08.936 --> 04:10.995
All yours.

04:12.439 --> 04:15.966
I got a teenager on a drug tear-
friend of a friend.

04:16.076 --> 04:18.510
Gonna track him down before he does
damage. I wanted to give you a heads-up.

04:18.612 --> 04:20.512
You should tell your C.O.

04:20.613 --> 04:23.549
- Like I said, I wanted to give you a heads-up.
- Like I said...

04:23.651 --> 04:26.620
I'm not in charge yet.
Seriously, tell Aceveda.

04:30.858 --> 04:33.019
All right, Social Services
is on the way...

04:33.127 --> 04:34.719
sojust wait in the other room,
sweetheart.

04:34.829 --> 04:40.131
[Groans]
Such a fine line, isn't it?

04:40.234 --> 04:41.223
Amen, brother.

04:42.970 --> 04:46.997
Book him with two of those
and pocket the other one.

04:47.107 --> 04:50.873
That's currency on the street. We use
the blow to buy intel on the next asshole.

04:52.746 --> 04:56.443
Hmm. You serious?

04:56.550 --> 04:58.484
How do you think I got Night Train
to give up this place?

04:58.586 --> 05:02.647
It's old school Vice, baby.
You use the world to bust the world.

05:02.756 --> 05:04.951
Hmm.

05:06.060 --> 05:08.290
All right.

05:08.395 --> 05:13.162
Hey. It's all good
in the hood, brother.

05:13.267 --> 05:15.098
[Chuckles]

05:28.015 --> 05:30.006
I'm sorry, Nance.

05:30.117 --> 05:33.086
The Mexican authorities
sent him back.

05:33.187 --> 05:36.088
/ got the call this morning.

05:39.193 --> 05:41.161
Can I help you?

05:41.262 --> 05:43.753
Yeah. We're here
to I.D. Ben Gilroy.

05:43.864 --> 05:45.764
You family?

05:45.866 --> 05:47.925
Wife and, uh, friend.

05:48.035 --> 05:50.401
Give me a minute.

06:01.048 --> 06:03.380
How are the girls
taking it?

06:03.484 --> 06:06.749
I haven't told them yet.

06:06.854 --> 06:09.687
They can barely wrap their brains
around him leaving the first time.

06:11.158 --> 06:13.558
- Yeah.
- [Door Opens]

06:13.661 --> 06:16.152
Follow me, please.

06:18.399 --> 06:20.731
Nance, you don't
have to see him this way.

06:20.834 --> 06:24.964
[Scoffs] I just don't want
to feel sorry for the piece of shit.

06:30.144 --> 06:32.578
Federales found him
with a bunch of fake Mexican I.D.'s...

06:32.680 --> 06:35.979
and an expired
California driver's license.

06:38.352 --> 06:40.513
Benjamin Wescott Gilroy?

06:40.621 --> 06:43.590
- Shit.
- That a positive /.D.?

06:43.691 --> 06:46.421
How did he die?

06:46.527 --> 06:49.257
Take your pick.
Cirrhosis, malnutrition-

06:49.363 --> 06:51.263
Official cause
was suffocation.

06:51.365 --> 06:53.663
Aspirated on his own vomit.

06:53.767 --> 06:57.533
Christ. This guy was the assistant
police chief? What happened?

06:57.638 --> 06:59.868
[Sighs]
Take your pick.

06:59.974 --> 07:02.704
[Rock]

07:02.810 --> 07:06.075
[Men, Women Chattering]

07:06.180 --> 07:09.149
[Ends]

07:11.285 --> 07:15.847
Ha-yea. Pimp's in the barn,
and we havin'a hoedown.

07:15.956 --> 07:17.981
- [Cops Laughing]
- Look, it's the Lord of the Vice.

07:18.092 --> 07:21.994
Just here to brighten up your day,
you bunch of sad, little desk monkeys.

07:24.965 --> 07:27.900
- Who's the cowboy?
- A guy I used to run with.

07:28.002 --> 07:31.267
He jumped over to Vice,
Central Bureau.

07:31.372 --> 07:34.569
Guessing by the look on your face,
it ended shit-side up.

07:34.675 --> 07:37.200
Just haven't seen him
for a while.

07:39.913 --> 07:43.076
How's that new partner
working out?

07:43.183 --> 07:45.083
It clicks.

07:47.688 --> 07:50.418
Well, I gotta get
back to this.

07:50.524 --> 07:52.617
Yeah, get to it.

07:55.896 --> 07:57.921
Cyril's got twoJuvie hearings pending...

07:58.032 --> 08:00.762
one for crack cocaine,
and the other's for public lewdness-

08:00.868 --> 08:03.564
getting head on a bench
in Griffith Park.

08:03.670 --> 08:05.797
- The head attached to a name?
- She fled.

08:05.906 --> 08:08.033
Cops got a description though.

08:08.142 --> 08:11.202
Slight, blonde, piercings,
early 20s.

08:11.311 --> 08:13.211
You know what?

08:13.313 --> 08:16.009
I spoke
to theJesus-whacked mom.

08:16.116 --> 08:18.209
Her address is different
than the one he gave...

08:18.318 --> 08:20.218
when he got busted
in the park.

08:20.320 --> 08:23.346
- Could be the blonde's place.
- Hmm.

08:24.825 --> 08:26.725
[Sighs]

08:26.827 --> 08:31.423
You know, it's strange,
the clubhouse being this way.

08:34.068 --> 08:36.400
Yeah. Thanks for unsealing this.

08:36.503 --> 08:39.700
/t's cool.
Hey, / heard about Gilroy. Damn.

08:39.807 --> 08:43.072
Yeah. Burial's tomorrow.
Be great if you could make it.

08:43.177 --> 08:46.738
I'm trying to give him
a decent send-off.

08:46.847 --> 08:48.815
Is, uh, Shane going?

08:50.484 --> 08:52.850
I don't know.

08:52.953 --> 08:54.853
- [Siren Wailing]
- [Radio, : Dispatcher] 211 in progress...

08:54.955 --> 08:57.685

09:10.437 --> 09:13.270

On the ground. Down!

09:13.373 --> 09:16.365
Hang on. Okay.
Just stay still. Just stay still.

09:16.477 --> 09:20.504
- [Radio Chatter, /ndistinct]
- [Groaning, Coughing]

09:22.316 --> 09:24.181
I have an update
on the garage sting...

09:24.284 --> 09:26.684
that I think you two
might want to hear.

09:28.122 --> 09:30.215
- Who's that with him?
- Lewis Sperling.

09:30.324 --> 09:32.349
Guy we flipped
to give us the sting.

09:32.459 --> 09:35.394
Other than a few busts
in the first month...

09:35.496 --> 09:37.726
our cameras haven't
turned up anything.

09:37.831 --> 09:40.561
No major deals,
no major connections.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.727
I can't control
what folks say and do.

09:43.837 --> 09:46.203
[Aceveda]
You played us, Lewis-

09:46.306 --> 09:50.242
set up another corporation
in your daughter's name.

09:50.344 --> 09:54.371
That's a violation
of the terms of your deal.

09:55.849 --> 09:58.682
I got two ex-wives,
five kids.

09:58.785 --> 10:02.983
/ can't make a living
with you guys perpetually up my ass.

10:03.090 --> 10:06.082
Maybe Mackey couldn't figure out
how you were end-running us...

10:06.193 --> 10:08.093
but / did.

10:08.195 --> 10:10.095
You tipped off
big-fish clients.

10:10.197 --> 10:12.392
They gave you seed money
to start a new company.

10:12.499 --> 10:15.627
You got your income back,
and they got a new place...

10:15.736 --> 10:17.704
- to launder cash.
- Jesus.

10:17.804 --> 10:20.102
How'd you miss this?

10:20.207 --> 10:22.573
[Lewis]
/'ll give you more names...

10:24.311 --> 10:26.211
from the new business.

10:26.313 --> 10:29.874
- Bigger guys.
- / don't think so, Lewis.

10:29.983 --> 10:34.545
It's over-
and now you're going to jail.

10:38.725 --> 10:41.216
[Sighs]

10:43.397 --> 10:45.797
Six months and thousands
of tax dollars pissed away.

10:45.899 --> 10:47.799
At least now we know why.

10:50.737 --> 10:53.797
- I dropped the ball.
- Little late for the humble servant routine.

10:53.907 --> 10:55.807
I'll set up the collars
on the ones we have.

10:55.909 --> 10:57.809
Make sure
it gets done right.

10:57.911 --> 10:59.970
Oh, and you're
the man to do it right?

11:00.080 --> 11:02.071
Just let him
fix the problem, okay?

11:02.182 --> 11:04.878
Sir, there are two people dead
at that Laundromat robbery.

11:04.985 --> 11:08.011
- One of them's an officer-involved shooting.
- Shit.

11:08.121 --> 11:10.112
- What do we know?
- Two suspects, looks like a Hispanic male...

11:10.224 --> 11:12.522
and a white female.

11:14.027 --> 11:16.928
- Do we have a description of the shooters?
- Just the girl.

11:17.030 --> 11:22.297
She's one of the D.O.A.'s.
Blonde, pierced nose, 120 pounds.

11:22.402 --> 11:24.802
What?

11:24.905 --> 11:28.068
This shooting might have something
to do with the kid that I'm looking for.

11:28.175 --> 11:30.268
Your wayward juvie's tied in
with a 187?

11:30.377 --> 11:32.902
If you're trying
to win me over...

11:33.013 --> 11:35.573
it's not working.

11:39.419 --> 11:42.081
Little Bonnie and Clyde shot and killed
the manager for $11 in quarters.

11:42.189 --> 11:44.089
The boy got away.

11:44.191 --> 11:46.091
Did you pull a name
and address on the girl?

11:46.193 --> 11:49.219
- Hope Anthony, 9246 East Olympic.
- Goddamn it!

11:49.329 --> 11:51.229
Problem?

11:51.331 --> 11:52.958
You got that xerox of Cyril on you?

11:53.066 --> 11:55.296
- Yeah.
- Okay, run it by the witnesses.

11:55.402 --> 11:58.803
Hey, I, uh, think the other shooter's
this kid I've been looking for.

11:58.905 --> 12:02.238
Unbelievable. You were putting cops
at risk by running this off the grid?

12:02.342 --> 12:04.674
- I didn't have all the facts.
- Well, at least you're consistent.

12:04.778 --> 12:06.939
Give the information
on the kid to Billings...

12:07.047 --> 12:10.881
- and finish closing out the garage sting.
- Come on.

12:11.018 --> 12:14.419
It sounded like you had something more
you wanted to share up there.

12:14.521 --> 12:16.421
What if I did?

12:16.523 --> 12:18.286
- Who are you?
- Captain Rawling.

12:18.392 --> 12:22.226
Aceveda's on his way out.
I'll be deciding what happens in the Barn.

12:23.530 --> 12:25.430
Well.

12:25.532 --> 12:28.524
I got a name will spin
your pretty little head around.

12:28.635 --> 12:31.365
Well, my pretty little head
doesn't spin that easy.

12:31.471 --> 12:33.371
Who is it?

12:33.473 --> 12:35.941
I want my deal
back in place.

12:36.043 --> 12:37.943
No jail time.

12:42.049 --> 12:45.780
That deal got flushed
with your corporate switcheroo.

12:45.886 --> 12:47.945
You gotta put something real
on the table...

12:48.055 --> 12:51.752
or the D.A.
won't even take my call.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.758
No deal, no name.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.386
No problem then.

12:59.032 --> 13:01.125

- There he is.
- [Mackey] Yeah?

13:01.234 --> 13:04.135
/t's me. / just messengered you
a package.

13:04.237 --> 13:06.102
- Is it ticking?
- Sort of.

13:06.206 --> 13:09.403
It's a class action lawsuit against the
Pyren Merril Pharmaceutical Company.

13:09.509 --> 13:11.409
What's that got
to do with us?

13:11.511 --> 13:15.743
Well, it claims that the rise in autism
is due to a vaccine preservative-

13:15.849 --> 13:18.249
vaccines that both Matthew and Megan
got when they were two.

13:18.352 --> 13:20.513
- That was right around when-
- I know, I know. Listen.

13:20.620 --> 13:23.646
There's a deadline, and we need
to sit down and talk with the lawyer.

13:23.757 --> 13:27.818
- Okay. How about tomorrow morning
when / drop off Cassie?
- Great.

13:27.928 --> 13:30.453
I'll set it up
and I will see you then. Bye.

13:30.564 --> 13:32.623
Armando Renta,
this is Vic Mackey.

13:32.733 --> 13:34.633
Good to meet you.

13:34.735 --> 13:36.930
Army's fresh off
a 14-month roll in "shock and awe. '"

13:37.037 --> 13:40.097
Gave those sand pigs a little taste
of the red, white and brown.

13:40.207 --> 13:44.200
- Mission accomplished?
- That's what they told us, so it must be true.

13:44.311 --> 13:46.370
How do you like running
with Wild Bill?

13:46.480 --> 13:49.972
Beats going door to door in Baghdad.
Now it's hick and the spic.

13:50.083 --> 13:53.484
That's clever.
Can you give us a minute?

13:56.390 --> 13:58.290
So, uh- So what's up?

13:58.392 --> 14:01.793
I need to know who's running crack
in Ashmore Heights these days.

14:01.895 --> 14:04.557
That's hard to day. Last few weeks,
someone's flooded the market.

14:04.664 --> 14:07.565
Every pusher in the hood's rock-heavy,
scrambling to unload product.

14:07.667 --> 14:11.296
- Since when do you need help powder tracking?
- You hear about Gilroy?

14:11.438 --> 14:13.303
What, is he back in town?

14:13.407 --> 14:15.898
Yeah. Spilling his guts
at the morgue.

14:16.009 --> 14:18.409
Drank himself to death.
They're gonna bury him tomorrow.

14:18.512 --> 14:21.811
- You should be there.
- I wanted the guy dead.

14:21.915 --> 14:23.815
Well, you got your wish.

14:23.917 --> 14:26.408
It's about his wife
and kids now.

14:26.520 --> 14:30.115
Are you forgetting he threatened
your family? He hung you out to I.A.D.?

14:30.223 --> 14:32.817
Money and pussy make man
do evil shit.

14:34.127 --> 14:36.027
Before all that,
he was a friend.

14:36.129 --> 14:38.927
Some bodies in blue
should show respect.

14:40.700 --> 14:43.601
I'll see if I can
shake myself free.

14:43.703 --> 14:46.433
- So we, uh-We done?
- I, uh-

14:46.540 --> 14:50.169
I got some worries about what I saw
over at Dead-Eye's the other night.

14:50.277 --> 14:52.177
Well, stop worrying.

14:52.279 --> 14:54.645
Dead-Eye was about to start
C./. duties for me...

14:54.748 --> 14:57.683
tracking Antwon Mitchell's new game-
till someone tapped his mute button.

14:57.784 --> 15:00.116
Now I'm watching Antwon.

15:00.220 --> 15:02.245
So if you got
any kind of relationship-

15:02.355 --> 15:04.448
I got no relationship with him.

15:07.427 --> 15:09.827
Then I got no problem.

15:11.765 --> 15:13.665
[Army]
Everything cool?

15:13.767 --> 15:17.066
Yeah, it's all good.
All right?

15:17.204 --> 15:20.105
Gonna take two, maybe three days
to lay a new piece of pipe.

15:20.207 --> 15:23.574
Get started. I want
to hear flushing in 48 hours.

15:23.677 --> 15:27.636
- What's going on?
- Having the men's room repaired.

15:27.747 --> 15:31.444
I didn't fix the men's room 'cause it
would have chewed up 35% of our budget.

15:31.551 --> 15:34.418
That's my worry now.

15:34.521 --> 15:36.421
Plumbing crews, cameras-

15:36.523 --> 15:39.754
Either you're completely naive
about our financial constraints-

15:39.860 --> 15:42.727
which I doubt-
or you've got something planned.

15:44.197 --> 15:46.097
[Sighs]

15:46.199 --> 15:49.930
I'm instituting seizures-
across the board.

15:50.036 --> 15:53.597
Cars, houses, businesses,
anything drug- or gang-related.

15:53.707 --> 15:56.767
- Asset forfeiture? The chiefll never go for that.
- He's already signed on.

15:56.877 --> 15:59.573
- Pol Com too.
- Citizens here can't afford lawyers...

15:59.679 --> 16:02.876
- to fight seized assets.
- I'm not worried about pissing off dealers...

16:02.983 --> 16:05.042
'cause we swiped
their pimp rides.

16:05.151 --> 16:07.051
We're gonna target
the right people.

16:07.153 --> 16:10.054
And you're thinking
of using Mackey for this?

16:12.158 --> 16:15.719
I'm still deciding.
I mean, your letter made him untradable.

16:15.829 --> 16:17.729
I have to use him somewhere.

16:17.831 --> 16:20.493
Keep him parked inside.
Anything else is dangerous. Trust me.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.500
Appreciate your input.

16:22.602 --> 16:24.502
[Plumber]
/ need a signature to start the work.

16:24.604 --> 16:28.005
- So why is this the first /'m hearing about all this?
- Oh, it happened fast.

16:28.108 --> 16:31.407
Thanks.
Anyway, after tomorrow, it's...

16:31.511 --> 16:34.139
mine to win or lose.

16:36.917 --> 16:38.817
She was unconscious
when they brought her in.

16:38.919 --> 16:42.116
Fishnets, Spandex- I don't think
she was out walking her dog.

16:42.222 --> 16:45.089
- Hooker rape?
- The name she put on her form...

16:45.191 --> 16:47.125
was Olive Martini.

16:47.227 --> 16:49.957
This is the only thing
that she had on her.

16:50.063 --> 16:52.930
- Ralphs card. That's official.
- She's in six.

16:53.033 --> 16:55.627
I'll go see if she's
shaken or stirred.

16:57.304 --> 17:00.569
You know what? Test results aren't
gonna be in till this afternoon.

17:00.674 --> 17:04.371
- I usually, uh, grab a taco across the street.
- From Rullio's?

17:04.477 --> 17:07.570
We treat at least four cases of food
poisoning a week from that place.

17:07.681 --> 17:09.580
/t's got an "A '"
in the window.

17:09.683 --> 17:12.310
- Stands for "acute gastritis."
- [Claudette] Did you say Room 6?

17:12.419 --> 17:14.319
Olive has left the building.

17:14.421 --> 17:16.388
[Dutch]
Okay.

17:19.826 --> 17:23.318
James has got a family friend.
Thinks you two would hit it off.

17:23.430 --> 17:25.397
Really?

17:25.498 --> 17:27.465
She does public affairs work.
Smart.

17:27.567 --> 17:29.899
- For some reason she likes cops.
- What's she look like?

17:30.003 --> 17:33.598
Petite, dark-skinned,
attractive.

17:33.707 --> 17:35.698
She's black?

17:38.011 --> 17:40.377
Never mind.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.573
- [Beeps]
- What?

17:42.682 --> 17:45.412
I dated a black girl
in college.

17:45.518 --> 17:48.646
Quarter black, but, I mean,
you could definitely tell.

17:48.755 --> 17:52.384
Forget it. What's on
the raped hooker's grocery card?

17:52.492 --> 17:54.960
[Stammering]
No address, bogus phone number.

17:55.061 --> 17:57.086
Hey, ifJames thinks
we should-

17:57.197 --> 17:59.631
- What hooker?
- Paramedics took her over to Mission Cross.

17:59.733 --> 18:02.327
She was beaten,
sexually assaulted.

18:02.435 --> 18:04.335
Gave a fake name
and disappeared.

18:04.437 --> 18:06.530
Did you have hospital personnel
go through the mug books?

18:06.640 --> 18:10.041
- No.
- Where did the attack happen?

18:10.143 --> 18:12.043
We don't know yet.

18:12.145 --> 18:14.204
Is there anything
you do know?

18:14.314 --> 18:18.011
Last week she bought three gallons
of Chablis and 11 boxes of condoms.

18:18.118 --> 18:21.383
/f she's pissed off a pimp,
her life could be in danger.

18:21.488 --> 18:24.889
Why don't you see
if anyone's called it in to 911.

18:24.991 --> 18:27.653
[Dial Tone]

18:30.563 --> 18:32.827
Transport's running late.

18:32.932 --> 18:34.900
You'll miss lunch call
at County.

18:35.001 --> 18:37.561
You think my price
is a couple of candy bars?

18:37.671 --> 18:41.732
Maybe you think better
on a full stomach.

18:41.841 --> 18:43.741
I'm thinking fine.

18:43.843 --> 18:45.743
I called the D.A.

18:45.845 --> 18:48.006
They won't budge
without a name first.

18:48.114 --> 18:52.414
- Looks like we got ourselves
an old-fashioned stalemate.
- Yeah, I guess so-

18:52.519 --> 18:56.421
except I'm going home
to a warm bed tonight.

18:56.523 --> 18:58.582
You go home to them.

19:02.696 --> 19:05.859
[Claudette]
The 911 call came in from a pay phone...

19:05.965 --> 19:07.865
- outside a Korean bakery.
- They were robbed 11 times last year.

19:07.967 --> 19:10.367
They installed
state-of-the-art surveillance.

19:10.470 --> 19:12.370
Cameras picked this up
early this morning.

19:12.472 --> 19:16.135
- [Moaning]
- [Grunting]

19:19.612 --> 19:21.910
We have the face
of our victim.

19:22.015 --> 19:23.949
And the back
of a rapist's head.

19:24.050 --> 19:25.881
Make some dubs of that tape.
The D.A. 's gonna need a copy.

19:25.985 --> 19:28.954
And let me know
when you locate her.

19:31.091 --> 19:33.855
- [Antwon Speaking, /ndistinct]
- Yo.

19:33.960 --> 19:37.157
- What are you building, Antwon?
- Are you here to pitch in?

19:37.263 --> 19:40.528
Forgot my tool belt at home.
Still got my cuffs though.

19:40.633 --> 19:45.696
House was in foreclosure.
Crackheads took it over, so we took it back.

19:45.805 --> 19:47.705
Help the owners
get back on their feet.

19:47.807 --> 19:50.605
M.L.K. toJimmy Carter.
You got all your bases covered, don't you?

19:50.710 --> 19:52.701
I got work to do, man.

19:52.812 --> 19:54.803
Hey. We're looking
for this kid.

19:54.914 --> 19:56.404
Put the word out
to your dealers.

19:56.516 --> 19:58.916
Give me a heads-up
if he tries to score.

19:59.018 --> 20:00.986
I run a rec center.

20:01.087 --> 20:02.987
Just because you
pound some nails...

20:03.089 --> 20:05.057
into some poor slob's house
doesn't mean shit to me.

20:05.158 --> 20:08.525
We both know you run drugs,
not a rec center.

20:10.330 --> 20:12.230
All right.

20:12.332 --> 20:15.597
My next step,
I start sweating the slangers.

20:15.702 --> 20:18.193
Those pussies always give up
chain of command.

20:18.304 --> 20:21.569
- / want to eradicate the crack
epidemic as much as you, man.
- [Phone Rings]

20:21.674 --> 20:24.666
- But my relationship to dealers-
- Hold that lie.

20:24.778 --> 20:27.645
- Yeah?
- [Whispering]

20:27.747 --> 20:31.774
Beauty. Hang on.
Lem may have a lead on Cyril's drug dealer.

20:31.885 --> 20:35.719
That gives you 20 minutes to find me
a shortcut to this missing kid...

20:35.822 --> 20:39.781
before I start twisting
the truth out of his dealer.

20:41.394 --> 20:43.726
There he is, on the black bike.
Right there. Pull over.

20:43.830 --> 20:45.491
- [Siren Blares]
- [Man] Cops.

20:45.598 --> 20:47.691
- You little dick!
- [Tires Screeching]

20:47.801 --> 20:50.099
[Man]
Go, Jaymon.

20:51.704 --> 20:53.729
[Voice Amplified]
Park the Schwinn, shithead.

20:53.840 --> 20:56.308
This is why you should
always wear a helmet.

20:58.411 --> 21:01.642
[Grunts, Groans]
Damn!

21:06.252 --> 21:08.516
[Panting]

21:13.426 --> 21:16.020
- Where'd he go? Where?
- Ran out the back.

21:17.831 --> 21:19.731
Psst.

21:19.833 --> 21:21.767
Hey, put that shit down.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.428
Aw, goddamn it.
He swallowed it.

21:25.538 --> 21:27.438
Shit.
Come here.

21:27.540 --> 21:29.531
[Gagging]

21:38.651 --> 21:41.176
- Goddamn.
- [Retching]

21:58.171 --> 22:00.833
Did you sell to him?
Did you? Did you?

22:02.275 --> 22:04.709
Know what?
Seems a little bound up.

22:04.811 --> 22:08.440
He bought a crumb from me a couple
hours ago. Asshole paid in quarters.

22:08.548 --> 22:10.914
- Where is he now?
- / don't know. / never sell to him before.

22:11.017 --> 22:12.917
- Bullshit.
- He ain't a regular.

22:13.019 --> 22:14.987
That's the truth, man.
I swear to God, man.

22:15.088 --> 22:17.386
- I swear. I swear.
- Get on your feet.

22:18.791 --> 22:21.316
Hey. Clean up, aisle four.

22:25.064 --> 22:27.931
You're really gonna set up
your office down here?

22:28.034 --> 22:30.229
I feel more at home
on the floor with the grunts.

22:30.336 --> 22:32.236
You know, for someone
who's supposed to be observing...

22:32.338 --> 22:34.772
you sure are
awfully active.

22:34.874 --> 22:37.104
I saw you chatting
with Lewis Sperling.

22:37.210 --> 22:39.940
Just trying to talk some sense
into him while he's still ours.

22:40.046 --> 22:42.776
I closed down
the garage sting.

22:42.882 --> 22:45.783
You know, your instincts,
six months ago, were right.

22:45.885 --> 22:48.115
It's got great potential.
It just took a wrong turn.

22:48.221 --> 22:50.985
It's been compromised.
It's dead.

22:51.090 --> 22:52.990
The A.G.C. angle, yes...

22:53.092 --> 22:55.287
but the new business
that Lewis set up is untainted.

22:55.395 --> 22:57.454
You got a good system in place.
We own the spyware.

22:57.563 --> 23:00.191
We get the bugs in the cars,
we're back in business.

23:00.300 --> 23:02.291
Yeah. You don't have
the authority yet...

23:02.402 --> 23:04.893
to be interviewing suspects,
getting the goddamn toilet fixed...

23:05.004 --> 23:07.700
or overturning my decisions.

23:07.807 --> 23:11.573
So until you're actually
in my office...

23:11.678 --> 23:13.805
- observe.
- [Drawer Slides Shut]

23:13.913 --> 23:16.108
[Door Buzzes]

23:16.215 --> 23:18.240
That the kid you almost choked out
with a bottle of mustard?

23:18.351 --> 23:20.410
- Who ratted? The condiment weasel?
- [Curtis Laughing]

23:20.520 --> 23:23.921
Kid's a novice. He was swallowing
open jums of crack.

23:24.023 --> 23:25.923
I induced vomiting.
Saved his goddamn life.

23:26.025 --> 23:27.925
I'm still allowed
to save lives, right?

23:28.027 --> 23:29.927
I want a complete report.

23:30.029 --> 23:32.259
Oh, sure. Have one for you
day after tomorrow.

23:32.365 --> 23:36.131
Oh, that's right. You'll be gone.
I'll mail one to you.

23:36.235 --> 23:38.760
We can't post these
in the Barn.

23:38.871 --> 23:41.339
Looks like the department
sanctioned people to attend the funeral.

23:41.441 --> 23:43.875
It's just a flyer.

23:49.515 --> 23:52.643
Cyril forged you this check
from his boss's restaurant.

23:52.752 --> 23:55.482
This bounced, man.
Kid didn't even write this anyway.

23:55.588 --> 23:58.455
It was this blonde T-girl.
She said she worked there.

24:03.162 --> 24:06.063
- Is this her?
- Shit.

24:06.165 --> 24:07.928
- That's her?
- Yeah.

24:08.034 --> 24:11.902
- [Curtis] She's a tranny?
- She tried to blow me to cover it.

24:12.005 --> 24:14.235
I ain't down with that
chicks-with-dicks shit, so I said no...

24:14.340 --> 24:16.240
and she came with the check.

24:16.342 --> 24:18.401
Where did he-she
score from you?

24:18.511 --> 24:22.345
- I ain't saying no more.
- You saw what I could do with a bottle of mustard.

24:22.448 --> 24:25.349
You imagine me
with the butt of a gun. Huh?

24:26.786 --> 24:29.755
- Underhell.
- "Underhell"?

24:29.856 --> 24:33.792
Under the tile factory,
by the freeway.

24:33.893 --> 24:36.589
All right, thanks.
Coroner just confirmed it.

24:36.696 --> 24:38.823
Hope had a rope.
Here we go.

24:38.931 --> 24:41.832
- [Man] Turn the lights off.
- [Mackey]Jesus.

24:41.934 --> 24:43.834
[Man #2]
/t's the cops.

24:50.743 --> 24:53.906
- There!
- [Ronnie] Gun.

24:54.013 --> 24:55.378
[Gun Clicking]

24:55.481 --> 24:58.507
Hold on! Hold your fire!
He's dry firing. The gun's empty.

24:58.618 --> 25:01.519
Cyril, drop the gun, kid! Cyril!

25:02.855 --> 25:05.847
Cyril, put the gun down, kid.

25:07.460 --> 25:11.556
All right, Cyril, that's it.
It's over. Come on.

25:11.664 --> 25:14.633
- [Sobbing]
- On your feet. Get up.

25:15.668 --> 25:17.568
Come on, kid.

25:23.176 --> 25:25.269
Look, I done
nothin' wrong.

25:25.378 --> 25:27.744
I don't know why Barbie and Skipper
hauled my ass down here.

25:27.847 --> 25:29.940
[Dutch]
They found you tricking.

25:30.049 --> 25:32.017
We just wanted to know
what happened to you.

25:32.118 --> 25:34.052
Yeah, like you're real concerned.
[Scoffs]

25:34.153 --> 25:37.919
/ was walking to the market.
Someonejumped me. Woke up in the E.R.

25:38.024 --> 25:41.619
We have security tape
that shows the assault, Olive.

25:41.727 --> 25:44.992
- Then go arrest the prick.
- We can't identify him.

25:45.098 --> 25:47.089
Me either then.

25:48.201 --> 25:50.601
Hey. Olive's prints
came back.

25:50.703 --> 25:52.603
Real name, Olivia Kenshaw.

25:52.705 --> 25:55.606
She's mapped, restricted
from the zone where she was raped...

25:55.708 --> 25:58.142
and she's H.I.V. -positive.

25:58.244 --> 26:00.405
How long have you
been tricking sick?

26:00.513 --> 26:05.041
I don't know. Ten months?
Risk is hype.

26:05.151 --> 26:07.051
Make all my customers
strap up.

26:07.153 --> 26:09.053
[Claudette]
What about the guy who raped you?

26:09.155 --> 26:13.888
- Was he using a condom?
- He wanted it, he got it.

26:13.993 --> 26:16.689
- What about all the innocent people
he could infect?
- Please.

26:16.796 --> 26:19.060
They should all die
sore and ugly.

26:19.165 --> 26:21.463
Wejust need
his name or description.

26:21.567 --> 26:23.592
And I just need a pussy
ain't so stretched.

26:23.703 --> 26:26.729
You've been mapped
with H.I.V., Olivia.

26:26.839 --> 26:28.898
State considers that
attempted murder.

26:29.008 --> 26:30.908
You'll do real time.

26:31.010 --> 26:34.741
[Claudette] Do you know how hard
it is to get the cocktail inside?

26:36.682 --> 26:39.276
If I give him up, I want
the other charges dropped.

26:41.687 --> 26:44.656
- / could ask the D.A.
- / want some kind of guarantee...

26:44.757 --> 26:46.554
and I want it in writing.

26:46.659 --> 26:49.924
The D.A. will never go for it. She's got
a four-page sheet, mapped with H.I.V.

26:50.029 --> 26:52.589
You mean the D.A. will never
go for it because it's our case.

26:52.698 --> 26:54.666
Well, that doesn't help.

26:54.767 --> 26:57.361
- I'll go play good cop.
- I already played good cop.

26:57.470 --> 26:59.665
I'll play better cop.

27:04.477 --> 27:06.377
What's that about?

27:06.479 --> 27:09.346
- Captain-hooker confidentiality?
- [Chuckles]

27:10.983 --> 27:15.147
- So, uh, what's James's friend's name?
- Forget it.

27:15.254 --> 27:18.553
You know, just because I asked if
she was black doesn't mean I'm a racist.

27:18.658 --> 27:22.116
And there are plenty of sisters
I think are hot. Halle Berry.

27:22.228 --> 27:24.753
Uh, Tyra Banks.

27:24.864 --> 27:27.389
Beyoncé.

27:27.500 --> 27:31.664
- [Laughing] Jesus.
- What?

27:33.673 --> 27:37.541
Cyril! Who put you on the rock, Cyril?
Who's your main score?

27:39.178 --> 27:42.705
- Fat Benish.
- Where can I find Fat Benish?

27:42.815 --> 27:44.715
Where, Cyril?

27:44.817 --> 27:47.149
Above Pip's Quick Lube.

27:49.355 --> 27:51.414
[Phone Beeping]

27:51.524 --> 27:56.018
Ronnie, Cyril's dealer
is a cat named, uh, Benish.

27:56.128 --> 27:58.096
He lives above
the Quick Lube on Hauser.

27:58.197 --> 28:00.097
Get a warrant.

28:00.199 --> 28:04.602
- Is he making sense yet?
- He's pretty doped up. He's detoxing.

28:04.704 --> 28:07.696
Cop downstairs said it was the other shooter
that killed the woman at the Laundromat.

28:07.807 --> 28:10.105
- That clears Cyril, right?
- He was part of the robbery.

28:10.209 --> 28:13.144
- Makes it his murder too.
- He didn't know what he was doing.

28:13.279 --> 28:15.713
It's that shit rock. What about
the guy that sold him the crack?

28:15.815 --> 28:17.715
I'm taking care of his dealer.

28:17.817 --> 28:19.717
Look, he's gonna be asleep
for a while.

28:19.819 --> 28:21.719
Why don't you go home,
get some rest?

28:21.821 --> 28:24.187
I want to be here
when he wakes up.

28:26.025 --> 28:28.892
- I think you're in a lot of pain.
- I don't need pity.

28:28.995 --> 28:30.895
Not pity.

28:30.997 --> 28:33.056
Compassion.

28:33.165 --> 28:35.963
Even if you don't think
you're worthy of it.

28:38.504 --> 28:41.735
We're guilty
of perpetuating that-

28:41.841 --> 28:45.072
- letting the streets take care of themselves.
- Got that right.

28:51.350 --> 28:54.581
- Can you tell me what happened?
- You seen the tape.

28:54.687 --> 28:56.587
I did.

28:58.624 --> 29:01.616
And I am so sorry.

29:07.466 --> 29:10.196
He was at the end
of an all-nighter.

29:10.303 --> 29:12.203
Paid for a suck.

29:12.305 --> 29:15.331
Got me in the back alley.

29:15.441 --> 29:17.807
Threw the first punch...

29:17.910 --> 29:20.572
before I could hit my knees.

29:23.816 --> 29:27.946
It was all about the hurt
with this guy.

29:32.258 --> 29:34.158
Hey.

29:34.260 --> 29:36.194
I see you got
our ho basket.

29:36.295 --> 29:38.092
[Army]
Nice addition to your stable.

29:38.197 --> 29:40.324
Don't know if they
worth a thing.

29:43.636 --> 29:46.036
[Coughing]

29:48.674 --> 29:50.801
[Shane]
Let me tell you how this works.

29:50.910 --> 29:54.368
You and the syphilis brigade,
you see anything, you hear anything-

29:54.480 --> 29:57.381
new players, new product,
anything happens on the street-

29:57.483 --> 30:00.145
I'm your first call.
Got that?

30:02.021 --> 30:05.081
- All right, Venus, you come with us.
- What for?

30:05.191 --> 30:07.819
To suck his big Latin dick.
[Laughs]

30:13.599 --> 30:15.499
Hey. This ain't for real.

30:15.601 --> 30:17.831
It's the only way to establish dominance
with these slit-mongers.

30:17.937 --> 30:19.598
Tail's the only currency they know.

30:19.705 --> 30:21.605
- Then let her suck you off.
- Come on, man, I'm married.

30:21.707 --> 30:23.641
Look, you got an E.D. thing
happening, just say so.

30:23.743 --> 30:25.836
- Blow me.
- I'll let her. Come on, sweetheart.

30:25.945 --> 30:28.846
Just sit back and relax, all right?
Enjoy the ride.

30:28.948 --> 30:31.917
You getting some back-alley Clinton
is really gonna help the cause.

30:43.062 --> 30:46.156
- Two's a mouthful, three's a crowd.
- Yeah.

30:54.240 --> 30:57.607
Man, Venus is going at it like
she's taking the rust off a low-rider.

31:00.179 --> 31:02.147
That's some
Boss Hogg bullshit, man.

31:02.248 --> 31:04.978
- Let's talk percentages.
- Percentages?

31:05.084 --> 31:07.052
Yeah. Keeping you
and your girls out of lockup...

31:07.153 --> 31:09.053
is gonna require
additional man hours.

31:09.155 --> 31:11.055
That's gonna cost you 10%.

31:11.157 --> 31:15.787
- That wasn't part of the deal.
- Make no mistake. There's no deal here.

31:15.895 --> 31:18.090
This is you doing what I say...

31:18.197 --> 31:20.097
or else you getting a cap
in the back of your ear...

31:20.199 --> 31:22.667
in something we like to call
"the line of duty."

31:24.904 --> 31:26.804
Now sit back down.

31:31.577 --> 31:34.171
If you're dicking us around again,
not only won't you get your deal...

31:34.280 --> 31:36.180
we'll make sure
you do your time in Solano.

31:36.282 --> 31:39.115
Warden's a friend of mine.
You think the inmates are bad?

31:39.218 --> 31:43.120
- Wait till you spend some happy time
with the guards.
- [Chuckling]

31:44.223 --> 31:47.090
Alex Kozodav.

31:47.193 --> 31:49.127
The taxi king?

31:49.228 --> 31:51.355
[Mackey]
Old-school Russian mob.

31:51.464 --> 31:53.489
Any other cab tries to pick up
a fare in Farmington...

31:53.599 --> 31:56.796
both car and driver end up
stolen and chopped.

31:56.902 --> 31:59.462
[Lewis] Ever since
the Armenian money train gotjacked...

31:59.572 --> 32:02.405
the Russians have been looking
for another place to launder their cash.

32:02.508 --> 32:06.467
And you've been more than willing
to help, for a fee.

32:06.579 --> 32:09.480
I'm also putting radios
in his cars.

32:09.582 --> 32:12.107
You ever see
Taxi Cab Confessions?

32:12.218 --> 32:15.517
Kozi cabs are the Russians' favorites.
A lot of potential marks.

32:17.223 --> 32:20.056
I'll see if there's a deal
to be made.

32:20.159 --> 32:22.423
Signed, sealed,
and deceitful.

32:22.528 --> 32:24.428
Bring him in,
you can release her.

32:24.530 --> 32:26.430
Bust her again,
it's attempted murder.

32:26.532 --> 32:28.932
- Make sure she's clear on that.
- Got it.

32:30.035 --> 32:31.935
Thanks for running
interference for us.

32:32.037 --> 32:36.406
- My pleasure.
- Another win for Billings.

32:36.509 --> 32:39.444
Okay, Olivia, let's take a look
at some of our mug shots...

32:39.545 --> 32:41.945
of known sexual offenders.

32:42.047 --> 32:44.242
He's white.
Pierced tongue.

32:44.350 --> 32:46.409
Delivers pizza.

32:46.519 --> 32:48.851
There's one of those Pizza Shack things
on the top of his car.

32:50.823 --> 32:52.950
I just talked with Lewis.

32:53.058 --> 32:55.549
Apparently his ride left
without him.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.963
Lewis's name.

33:02.668 --> 33:06.570
- "Alex Kozodav."
- L.A. boss, Russian organized crime.

33:06.672 --> 33:09.732
This guy's on everybody's
top-ten list.

33:09.842 --> 33:13.334
The D.A. wants to play ball.

33:15.180 --> 33:19.480
/ think you are making decisions
to settle a grudge-

33:19.585 --> 33:21.917
decisions /'m gonna
have to live with.

33:22.021 --> 33:24.751
These property seizures
that you want to impose-

33:24.857 --> 33:27.018
who's gonna have to live
with those decisions?

33:27.126 --> 33:30.095
l-I could have let Lewis get lost
in the system for a couple of days...

33:30.195 --> 33:32.663
taken the credit
when you were gone...

33:32.765 --> 33:34.665
but you've earned this.

33:34.767 --> 33:39.136
I figured we could present it
to the chief together.

33:42.708 --> 33:44.608
I'll take a look at it.

33:47.379 --> 33:50.280
- [Tires Screeching]
- Shit!

33:50.382 --> 33:52.441
God!

33:52.551 --> 33:55.452
Somebody torched
Benish's place.

33:55.554 --> 33:59.285
God!
Hey, Chief.

33:59.391 --> 34:03.691
- Hey, I got a warrant to search upstairs.
- Pretty hot in there right now.

34:03.796 --> 34:06.230
Yeah, I'm aware of that.
Any way of putting it down?

34:06.332 --> 34:09.824
I doubt it.
We've already lost the top floor.

34:09.935 --> 34:13.029
All right. Thanks.

34:13.138 --> 34:17.130
- Hey! Who owns the bikes?
- [Man] Fat guy. He lives there.

34:17.242 --> 34:20.768
- You sure?
- You don't forget a 300-pound dude
on a scooter.

34:20.879 --> 34:23.143
Check the plates.

34:30.522 --> 34:33.047
[Olive Screaming]

34:54.279 --> 34:56.839
- Oh, man.
- [Mackey] What's the matter, fat man?

34:56.949 --> 35:00.976
- You got insurance, don't you?
- Yeah, I'm in real good hands.

35:01.086 --> 35:04.180
- Too bad about your little crack factory upstairs.
- What's that smell?

35:04.289 --> 35:08.555
- Oh, yeah. You got smoke.
- [Laughing]

35:08.661 --> 35:10.891
I ran the VI N numbers
on your scooters.

35:10.996 --> 35:13.590
Stolen the same night
six other bikes got jacked.

35:13.699 --> 35:15.826
I got grand theft.

35:15.934 --> 35:17.834
Antwon Mitchell-

35:17.936 --> 35:19.904
he the one filling
the cesspool with new rock?

35:20.005 --> 35:24.669
Rumor is Mr. Mitchell's walking
the straight and narrow now.

35:24.777 --> 35:29.146
Oh, it's gonna be hard
maintaining that edge in the joint...

35:29.248 --> 35:32.081
when gen pop finds out you
the little red scooter bandit.

35:32.184 --> 35:34.948
- There's been a crack flood 'cause
everybody's dumping what they got.
- Why?

35:35.087 --> 35:38.750
It's getting pushed out.
Crack's bad business.

35:38.857 --> 35:42.554
Cluckers all crazy.
Die fast.

35:42.661 --> 35:44.856
Strip a hood
of its potential.

35:44.963 --> 35:47.090
Pushed out for what?

35:47.199 --> 35:50.032
- Tar.
- Heroin?

35:52.204 --> 35:56.800
Sleepers hold a job.
Less crime, less heat. Everybody wins.

35:56.909 --> 35:59.139
Antwon the one
enforcing that mandate?

35:59.244 --> 36:02.213
That part of his
community salvation?

36:02.314 --> 36:04.874
- Ain't no salvation here.
- [Phone Rings]

36:04.983 --> 36:07.178
- Yeah?
- [Shane] Looked into Ashmore.

36:07.286 --> 36:09.049
Niners used to have
the lion's share...

36:09.154 --> 36:10.917
but since this new product
hit town, it's real messy.

36:11.023 --> 36:13.116
That ain't new product.
It's old.

36:13.225 --> 36:16.717
Street's dumping all their crack
to make way for tar heroin.

36:16.829 --> 36:20.321
- Who told you that?
- A guy with weight.

36:20.432 --> 36:23.833
I'll see you.
Try to make it to the funeral.

36:23.936 --> 36:26.427
Vic, inspector says
it started with a grease fire.

36:26.538 --> 36:29.905
- What, engine grease?
- Cooking grease.

36:31.410 --> 36:33.241
Shit.

36:33.378 --> 36:36.245
[Mackey] How many more pictures of this kid
am / gonna find if / start opening drawers?

36:36.348 --> 36:40.614
What are you talking about?
I care about him.

36:42.020 --> 36:45.148
Guy dealing to Cyril-
his place got torched tonight.

36:45.257 --> 36:48.693
Fire was started
with cooking grease.

36:52.364 --> 36:55.458
You're not
a very good criminal, Cal.

36:55.567 --> 36:58.764
I smell the smoke.
Please don't make me search the place.

36:59.905 --> 37:03.102
- You screwing this kid?
- Don't say that.

37:03.208 --> 37:05.108
Are you?

37:17.990 --> 37:20.015
He slept here...

37:20.125 --> 37:22.958
but I never laid a hand on him.

37:25.397 --> 37:27.422
He wanted to get the operation
when he turned 18.

37:27.533 --> 37:30.161
/ told him /'d pay for it.
We were-

37:30.269 --> 37:32.430
We were gonna be together.

37:34.006 --> 37:36.167
Jesus Christ!

37:36.275 --> 37:38.300
I'm sorry.

37:39.678 --> 37:41.703
l- I know it was wrong.

37:41.814 --> 37:44.908
You could have hurt someone
setting that fire, Cal.

37:45.017 --> 37:46.917
Nobody was home.

37:50.189 --> 37:52.623
That dealer took away...

37:52.724 --> 37:57.593
the only thing I love.

37:57.696 --> 38:00.256
You know what that feels like?

38:01.366 --> 38:03.994
You know
what that feels like?

38:10.475 --> 38:12.375
[Weeping]

38:17.149 --> 38:19.049
Call a lawyer.

38:19.151 --> 38:23.781
When the detectives come,
don't say anything.

38:23.889 --> 38:26.517
Get rid of the photos.
The dresses too.

38:30.996 --> 38:32.987
[Man]
Thimerosal has been used...

38:33.098 --> 38:35.464
as a vaccine preservative
since the '30s...

38:35.567 --> 38:38.229
- even though it's 49% mercury.
- Which is extremely toxic...

38:38.337 --> 38:40.237
especially with children
under three.

38:42.741 --> 38:46.233
And you think this mercury
in the vaccine is the missing link?

38:46.345 --> 38:48.245
Yeah, the increase
in the rate of autism...

38:48.347 --> 38:50.747
parallels the rise
in Thimerosal exposure.

38:50.849 --> 38:52.749
It's all broken down
in the science there.

38:52.851 --> 38:55.115
They're just figuring
this out now?

38:55.220 --> 38:59.748
Look. Forgive the hard press, but the statute
of limitations is running out on Matthew.

38:59.858 --> 39:03.350
You have only three years from
the time of diagnosis to file a suit.

39:03.462 --> 39:05.692
Okay.

39:05.797 --> 39:09.198
There's no legal fees, Mr. Mackey.
We only collect if we win the case.

39:09.301 --> 39:14.364
But expert witness costs are expensive-
$10,000 to $15,000 per child.

39:14.473 --> 39:16.532
Jesus.

39:16.642 --> 39:19.076
Yeah. Well, you got a lot
to think about...

39:19.177 --> 39:23.705
so why don't you take some time
and let me know what you decide.

39:23.815 --> 39:26.978
I know someone should pay.

39:28.921 --> 39:31.389
[Aceveda]
And that's it.

39:31.490 --> 39:33.890
/ can't think of anything else
/ need to tell you.

39:33.992 --> 39:37.553
You seem to have strong opinions
on how you want to do things.

39:37.663 --> 39:39.563
Okay.

39:41.099 --> 39:45.729
Well, we can tell the bosses
we had our transition meeting.

39:45.837 --> 39:47.737
Thanks.

39:47.839 --> 39:51.741
Oh, there is one more thing.
I spoke to Chief Bankston.

39:51.843 --> 39:56.405
He seems to be excited at the prospect
of netting Alex Kozodav...

39:56.515 --> 40:00.281
so the garage sting
will stay up and running.

40:02.354 --> 40:07.792
- Did my name come up?
- Oh, / don't believe so, but Vic's name did.

40:07.893 --> 40:11.556
Chief wants him running the project,
which keeps him on a tight leash.

40:11.663 --> 40:14.962
You'll thank me for that.

40:17.803 --> 40:19.896
[Bagpipes: "A mazing Grace'"]

40:20.005 --> 40:23.463
[Woman Weeping]

40:42.427 --> 40:46.295
Sorry for your loss.
Excuse me.

40:51.403 --> 40:55.806
- You didn't have to come.
- I knew Ben a little... in better years.

40:55.907 --> 40:57.966
Yeah, me too.

40:58.076 --> 41:00.169
Puts everyday bullshit
in perspective.

41:00.278 --> 41:03.577
I told Aceveda
about Kozodav.

41:03.682 --> 41:06.913
He went behind my back,
got the chief pregnant on the idea.

41:07.019 --> 41:09.078
Took credit,
covered his ass.

41:09.187 --> 41:12.679
He also convinced the chief
that you should still run the sting.

41:12.791 --> 41:17.057
- Means I gotta find someone else
to head up the task force.
- I can do both.

41:17.162 --> 41:20.097
Look, Ronnie knows the drill.

41:20.198 --> 41:22.098
He can handle
the garage stuff.

41:22.200 --> 41:25.931
Put me back
on the street with the unis.

41:26.038 --> 41:29.098
Nobody knows the bangers
better than I do.

41:30.375 --> 41:32.605
Please.

41:32.711 --> 41:36.169
Put me somewhere
where I can make a dent.

41:40.919 --> 41:44.411
The only way
I can sell that to the chief...

41:44.523 --> 41:49.961
is I give Internal Affairs full access
to the Barn- open house.

41:50.062 --> 41:52.622
- Means you can play hard, but-
- I get it.

41:52.731 --> 41:55.256
I.A.D. gets a whiff
of anything dirty...

41:55.367 --> 41:58.632
near these seizures-
me, this policy, everything-

41:58.737 --> 42:00.637
it's dead in the water.

42:03.542 --> 42:06.067
I'll do it right.

42:08.847 --> 42:11.247
Okay.

42:17.823 --> 42:20.053
Go in the car. Go on.

42:24.863 --> 42:28.492
I know that, uh, you're the one
that got this turnout.

42:28.600 --> 42:32.092
- Means a lot to my girls.
- He was my oldest friend.

42:33.772 --> 42:36.036
You doing okay?

42:36.141 --> 42:38.109
I hope he was scared...

42:38.210 --> 42:40.110
and alone...

42:40.212 --> 42:42.146
and in a lot of pain.

42:42.247 --> 42:46.115
- He had his demons, Nance.
- He had a dick he couldn't keep in his pants.

42:46.218 --> 42:49.119
Threw away 20 years
on the job.

42:49.221 --> 42:52.952

44:26.218 --> 44:28.049
We gave you Cromo
and his underage hit...

44:28.153 --> 44:30.713
but the girls, that was Antwon
paying back a favor.

44:30.822 --> 44:33.416
Now you, you taking a piece,
that makes him look the fool.

44:33.525 --> 44:35.425
Yeah? Well, you tell
the great reformist...

44:35.527 --> 44:39.395
- that's the cost of doing business.
- Doesn't work that way.

44:39.497 --> 44:41.431
What doesn't work
is me finding out secondhand...

44:41.533 --> 44:44.093
about dealers dumping crack
to make room for tar.

44:44.202 --> 44:47.103
I don't know nothing
about that, man.

44:47.205 --> 44:49.264
Of course you wouldn't.

44:49.374 --> 44:51.899
You're just
a slow-witted bitch.

44:52.010 --> 44:54.410
What?

44:56.448 --> 44:57.574
Shit!

face-to-face or nothing at all!
