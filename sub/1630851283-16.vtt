Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.
We go further, so you can.

00:06.673 --> 00:11.244
>> Wertheim: ON THIS SPECIAL
EDITION OF "60 MINUTES
PRESENTS:" THE RITCHIE BOYS.
THINK YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT WORLD

00:11.311 --> 00:18.318
WAR II'S GREATEST HEROES?
(<i> EXPLOSION</i> )
THINK AGAIN.
TONIGHT, YOU'LL MEET FOUR

00:18.385 --> 00:26.760
SURVIVING MEMBERS OF A SECRET
GROUP CALLED THE RITCHIE BOYS--
11,000 AMERICAN SOLDIERS, MANY
OF THEM JEWS, WHO HAD FLED NAZI

00:26.826 --> 00:32.565
GERMANY AND WERE TRAINED IN
ESPIONAGE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL
WARFARE.
HOW EFFECTIVE WERE THEY AT

00:32.632 --> 00:38.772
GATHERING INTELLIGENCE?
>> THEY WERE INCREDIBLY
EFFECTIVE.
60%-PLUS OF THE ACTIONABLE

00:38.838 --> 00:46.880
INTELLIGENCE GATHERED ON THE
BATTLEFIELD WAS GATHERED BY
RITCHIE BOYS.
THEY MADE A MASSIVE CONTRIBUTION

00:46.946 --> 01:00.560
TO ESSENTIALLY EVERY BATTLE THAT
THE AMERICANS FOUGHT-- THE
ENTIRE SETS OF BATTLES ON THE
WESTERN FRONT.

01:00.627 --> 01:05.865
>> Wertheirm: GOOD EVENING.
I'M JON WERTHEIM.
WELCOME TO "60 MINUTES
PRESENTS."

01:05.932 --> 01:12.138
FOR AS CASUALLY AS WE OFTEN TOSS
AROUND THE WORD "HERO,"
SOMETIMES, NO LESSER TERM
APPLIES.

01:12.205 --> 01:17.877
TONIGHT, WE'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO
MEMBERS OF A SECRET AMERICAN
INTELLIGENCE UNIT WHO FOUGHT IN
WORLD WAR II.

01:17.944 --> 01:25.185
WHAT'S MOST EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT
THIS GROUP?
MANY OF THEM WERE GERMAN-BORN
JEWS WHO FLED THEIR HOMELAND,

01:25.251 --> 01:30.423
CAME TO AMERICA, AND THEN JOINED
THE U.S. ARMY.
THEIR MISSION: TO USE THEIR
KNOWLEDGE OF THE GERMAN LANGUAGE

01:30.490 --> 01:37.864
AND CULTURE TO RETURN TO EUROPE
AND FIGHT NAZISM.
THE RITCHIE BOYS, AS THEY WERE
KNOWN, TRAINED IN ESPIONAGE AND

01:37.931 --> 01:44.737
FRONTLINE INTERROGATION.
AND, INCREDIBLY, THEY WERE
RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE
COMBAT INTELLIGENCE GATHERED ON

01:44.804 --> 01:49.843
THE WESTERN FRONT.
FOR DECADES, THEY DIDN'T DISCUSS
THEIR WORK.
FORTUNATELY, SOME OF THE RITCHIE

01:49.909 --> 01:57.717
BOYS ARE STILL AROUND TO TELL
THEIR TALES, AND THAT INCLUDES
THE LIFE-FORCE THAT IS GUY
STERN, AGE 99.

01:57.784 --> 02:07.460
YOU WORK SIX DAYS A WEEK, YOU
SWIM EVERY MORNING, YOU LECTURE.
ANY SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN?
>> Guy Stern: WELL, I THINK NOT.

02:07.527 --> 02:15.768
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
BUT I DON'T RUN AS FAST, I DON'T
SWIM AS FAST.
BUT I FEEL HAPPY WITH MY TASKS.

02:15.835 --> 02:25.311
>> Wertheim: JUST TWO WEEKS SHY
OF TURNING 100, GUY STERN DRIPS
WITH VITALITY.
HE STILL WORKS SIX DAYS A WEEK--

02:25.378 --> 02:31.784
AND IF YOU GET UP EARLY ENOUGH,
YOU MIGHT CATCH HIM WORKING OUT
AT HIS LOCAL PARK IN THE DETROIT
SUBURBS.

02:31.851 --> 02:37.924
BUT, ASK HIM ABOUT HIS MOST
FORMATIVE EXPERIENCE, AND HE
DOESN'T HESITATE.
IT WAS HIS SERVICE IN THE

02:37.991 --> 02:45.732
MILITARY DURING WORLD WAR II.
WHAT WAS IT LIKE FOR YOU,
LEAVING NAZI GERMANY, ESCAPING
AS A JEW, AND THE NEXT TIME YOU

02:45.798 --> 02:51.771
GO BACK TO EUROPE, IT'S TO FIGHT
THOSE GUYS?
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?
>> Stern: I WAS A SOLDIER, DOING

02:51.838 --> 03:01.981
MY JOB, AND THAT PRECLUDED ANY
CONCERN THAT I WAS GOING BACK TO
A COUNTRY I ONCE WAS VERY
ATTACHED TO.

03:02.048 --> 03:09.856
I HAD A WAR TO FIGHT, AND I DID
IT.
>> Wertheim: THIS IS GUY STERN
80 YEARS AGO.

03:09.923 --> 03:17.764
HE IS AMONG THE LAST SURVIVING
RITCHIE BOYS-- A GROUP OF YOUNG
MEN, MANY OF THEM GERMAN JEWS,
WHO PLAYED AN OUTSIZED ROLE IN

03:17.830 --> 03:22.201
HELPING THE ALLIES WIN WORLD WAR
II.
THEY TOOK THEIR NAME FROM THE
PLACE THEY TRAINED: CAMP

03:22.268 --> 03:29.976
RITCHIE, MARYLAND, A SECRET
AMERICAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE
CENTER DURING THE WAR.
STARTING IN 1942, MORE THAN

03:30.043 --> 03:37.984
11,000 SOLDIERS WENT THROUGH THE
RIGOROUS TRAINING AT WHAT WAS
THE ARMY'S FIRST CENTRALIZED
SCHOOL FOR INTELLIGENCE AND

03:38.051 --> 03:44.090
PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE.
>> David Frey: THE PURPOSE OF
THE FACILITY WAS TO TRAIN
INTERROGATORS.

03:44.157 --> 03:49.963
THAT WAS THE BIGGEST WEAKNESS
THAT THE ARMY RECOGNIZED THAT IT
HAD, WHICH WAS BATTLEFIELD
INTELLIGENCE, AND THE

03:50.029 --> 03:58.104
INTERROGATION NEEDED TO TALK TO,
SOMETIMES CIVILIANS, MOST OF THE
TIME PRISONERS OF WAR, IN ORDER
TO GLEAN INFORMATION FROM THEM.

03:58.171 --> 04:06.045
>> Wertheim: DAVID FREY IS A
PROFESSOR OF HISTORY AND
DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR
HOLOCAUST STUDIES AT THE U.S.

04:06.112 --> 04:12.018
MILITARY ACADEMY AT WEST POINT.
HOW EFFECTIVE WERE THEY AT
GATHERING INTELLIGENCE?
>> Frey: THEY WERE INCREDIBLY

04:12.085 --> 04:19.692
EFFECTIVE.
60%-PLUS OF THE ACTIONABLE
INTELLIGENCE GATHERED ON THE
BATTLEFIELD WAS GATHERED BY

04:19.759 --> 04:24.998
RITCHIE BOYS.
>> Wertheim: 60% OF THE
ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE?
>> Frey: YES.

04:25.064 --> 04:31.871
THEY MADE A MASSIVE CONTRIBUTION
TO ESSENTIALLY EVERY BATTLE THAT
THE AMERICANS FOUGHT.
THE ENTIRE SETS OF BATTLES ON

04:31.938 --> 04:37.443
THE WESTERN FRONT.
>> Wertheim: RECRUITS WERE
CHOSEN BASED ON THEIR KNOWLEDGE
OF EUROPEAN LANGUAGE AND

04:37.510 --> 04:42.048
CULTURE, AS WELL AS THEIR HIGH
I.Q.s.
ESSENTIALLY, THEY WERE
INTELLECTUALS.

04:42.115 --> 04:50.056
THE LARGEST SET OF GRADUATES
WERE 2,000 GERMAN-BORN JEWS.
>> Frey: IF WE TAKE CAMP RITCHIE
IN MICROCOSM, IT WAS ALMOST THE

04:50.123 --> 04:56.396
IDEAL OF AN AMERICAN MELTING
POT.
YOU HAD PEOPLE COMING FROM ALL
OVER, UNITING FOR A PARTICULAR

04:56.462 --> 05:00.433
CAUSE.
>> Wertheim: ALL IN SERVICE OF
WINNING THE WAR?
>> Frey: ALL IN SERVICE OF

05:00.500 --> 05:05.204
WINNING THE WAR.
AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT FORGES
UNITY BETTER THAN HAVING A
COMMON ENEMY.

05:05.271 --> 05:10.143
YOU HAD A WHOLE LOAD OF
IMMIGRANTS WHO REALLY WANTED TO
GET BACK INTO THE FIGHT.
>> Wertheim: IMMIGRANTS LIKE GUY

05:10.209 --> 05:18.117
STERN.
HE GREW UP IN A CLOSE-KNIT
FAMILY IN THE TOWN OF
HILDESHEIM, GERMANY.

05:18.184 --> 05:26.125
WHEN HITLER TOOK POWER IN 1933,
STERN SAYS THE CLIMATE GREW
INCREASINGLY HOSTILE.
>> Stern: MY FELLOW STUDENTS--

05:26.192 --> 05:32.999
IT WAS AN ALL-MALE SCHOOL--
WITHDREW FROM YOU.
>> Wertheim: BECAUSE YOU WERE
JEWISH, YOU WERE OSTRACIZED?

05:33.066 --> 05:42.108
>> Stern: THAT IS CORRECT.
I WENT TO MY FATHER ONE DAY AND
I SAID, "CLASSES ARE BECOMING A
TORTURE CHAMBER."

05:42.175 --> 05:50.116
>> Wertheim: BY 1937, VIOLENCE
AGAINST JEWS WAS ESCALATING.
SENSING DANGER, STERN'S FATHER
TRIED TO GET THE FAMILY OUT--

05:50.183 --> 05:57.390
BUT THE STERNS COULD ONLY SEND
ONE OF THEIR OWN TO THE U.S.
THEY CHOSE THEIR ELDEST SON.
DO YOU REMEMBER SAYING GOODBYE

05:57.457 --> 06:02.195
TO YOUR FAMILY?
>> Stern: YES.
>> Wertheim: WHAT DO YOU
REMEMBER FROM THAT?

06:02.261 --> 06:10.369
>> Stern: HANDKERCHIEFS.
I COULDN'T KNOW AT THAT POINT
THAT I WOULD NEVER SEE MY
SIBLINGS OR MY PARENTS AGAIN,

06:10.436 --> 06:18.177
NOR MY GRANDMOTHER, AND SO FORTH
AND SO ON.
>> Wertheim: GUY STERN ARRIVED
IN THE U.S. ALONE AT AGE 15,

06:18.244 --> 06:27.987
SETTLING WITH AN UNCLE IN ST.
LOUIS.
WHEN THE JAPANESE BOMBED PEARL
HARBOR IN 1941, STERN, BY THEN A

06:28.054 --> 06:37.764
COLLEGE STUDENT, RACED TO
ENLIST.
>> Stern: I HAD AN IMMEDIATE,
VISCERAL RESPONSE TO THAT, AND

06:37.830 --> 06:46.072
THAT WAS, THIS IS MY WAR FOR
MANY REASONS.
PERSONAL, OF COURSE, BUT ALSO
THIS COUNTRY-- I WAS REALLY

06:46.139 --> 06:54.180
TREATED WELL.
>> Wertheim: IN NEW YORK, PAUL
FAIRBROOK HAD A SIMILAR IMPULSE.
NOW 98, FAIRBROOK IS THE FORMER

06:54.247 --> 07:01.788
DEAN OF THE CULINARY INSTITUTE
OF AMERICA.
HIS JEWISH FAMILY LEFT GERMANY
IN 1933 WHEN HE WAS 10.

07:01.854 --> 07:06.626
WHY DID YOU WANT TO ENLIST,
INITIALLY?
>> Paul Fairbrook: LOOK, I'M A
GERMAN JEW, AND THERE'S NOTHING

07:06.692 --> 07:14.233
THAT I WANTED MORE, IS TO GET
SOME REVENGE ON HITLER, WHO
KILLED MY UNCLES, AND MY AUNTS,
AND MY COUSINS.

07:14.300 --> 07:20.606
AND THERE WAS NO QUESTION IN MY
MIND, AND NEITHER OF ALL THE MEN
IN CAMP RITCHIE.
SO MANY OF THEM WERE JEWISH.

07:20.673 --> 07:26.245
WE WERE ALL ON THE SAME
WAVELENGTH.
WE WERE DELIGHTED TO GET A
CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE

07:26.312 --> 07:30.650
UNITED STATES.
>> Wertheim: AT THE TIME,
THOUGH, THE MILITARY WOULDN'T
TAKE VOLUNTEERS WHO WEREN'T BORN

07:30.716 --> 07:38.257
IN THE U.S.
BUT, WITHIN A FEW MONTHS, THE
GOVERNMENT REALIZED THESE SO-
CALLED ENEMY ALIENS COULD BE A

07:38.324 --> 07:44.330
VALUABLE RESOURCE IN THE WAR.
WHY WERE THE RITCHIE BOYS SO
SUCCESSFUL?
>> Fairbrook: WELL, BECAUSE IT

07:44.397 --> 07:50.102
WAS AN UNUSUAL PART OF THE
UNITED STATES ARMY.
YOU CAN LEARN TO SHOOT A RIFLE
IN SIX MONTHS, BUT YOU CAN'T

07:50.169 --> 07:54.240
LEARN FLUENT GERMAN IN SIX
MONTHS.
AND THAT'S WHAT THE KEY TO THE
SUCCESS WAS.

07:54.307 --> 08:00.413
>> Wertheirm: WAS IT YOUR
KNOWLEDGE OF THE LANGUAGE OR
YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PSYCHOLOGY
AND THE GERMAN CULTURE?

08:00.479 --> 08:06.319
>> Fairbrook: OH, THAT IS A VERY
GOOD QUESTION.
THAT IS THE KEY TO BEING A GOOD
INTERROGATOR.

08:06.385 --> 08:14.327
YOU REALLY KNOW AN AWFUL LOT OF
THE SUBTLETIES WHEN YOU'RE
HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH
ANOTHER GERMAN, AND WE WERE ABLE

08:14.393 --> 08:22.201
TO FIND OUT THINGS IN THEIR
ANSWERS THAT ENABLED US TO ASK
MORE QUESTIONS.
YOU REALLY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,

08:22.268 --> 08:30.309
IT HELPS TO HAVE BEEN BORN IN
GERMANY IN ORDER TO-- IN ORDER
TO DO A GOOD JOB.
>> Wertheim: BOTH REFUGEES LIKE

08:30.376 --> 08:37.817
FAIRBROOK AND STERN, AS WELL AS
A NUMBER OF AMERICAN-BORN
RECRUITS WITH REQUISITE LANGUAGE
SKILLS, WERE DRAFTED INTO THE

08:37.884 --> 08:45.424
ARMY AND SENT TO CAMP RITCHIE.
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT YOU WERE
GOING TO GO TO CAMP RITCHIE?
>> Stern: I WAS CALLED TO THE

08:45.491 --> 08:52.198
COMPANY OFFICE AND TOLD, "YOU'RE
SHIPPING OUT."
AND I SAID, "MAY I KNOW WHERE
I'M GOING?"

08:52.265 --> 08:57.336
AND HE SAID "NO, MILITARY
SECRET."
>> Wertheim: THEY SWORE YOU TO
SECRECY?

08:57.403 --> 09:02.808
>> Stern: YES
>> Wertheim: ORIGINALLY A
RESORT, CAMP RITCHIE WAS A
CURIOUSLY IDYLLIC SETTING TO

09:02.875 --> 09:10.283
PREPARE FOR THE HARSHNESS AND
BRUTALITY OF WAR.
NESTLED IN THE BLUE RIDGE
MOUNTAINS OF MARYLAND, IT WAS

09:10.349 --> 09:16.255
AWAY FROM PRYING EYES-- AND
PRYING SPIES- BUT CLOSE ENOUGH
TO DECISION MAKERS AT THE
PENTAGON.

09:16.322 --> 09:22.261
GIVE US A SENSE OF THE KINDS OF
COURSES THEY TOOK.
>> Frey: WELL, THE MOST
IMPORTANT PART OF THE TRAINING

09:22.328 --> 09:28.267
WAS THAT THEY LEARNED TO DO
INTERROGATION, AND IN PARTICULAR
OF PRISONERS OF WAR.
TECHNIQUES WHERE YOU WANT TO GET

09:28.334 --> 09:34.040
PEOPLE TO TALK TO YOU.
YOU WANT TO CONVINCE THEM THAT
YOU'RE TRUSTWORTHY.
YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM THAT

09:34.106 --> 09:38.377
FEELING THAT YOU KNOW WHO THEY
ARE, THEY KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT THEM
ALREADY.

09:38.444 --> 09:46.652
SO, WHATEVER INFORMATION THEY'RE
GIVING YOU IS INFORMATION THAT
YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW.
BUT THEY ALSO DID TERRAIN

09:46.719 --> 09:54.160
ANALYSIS, THEY ALSO DID PHOTO
ANALYSIS, AND AERIAL
RECONNAISSANCE ANALYSIS.
THEY DID COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

09:54.226 --> 09:58.264
TRAINING.
>> Wertheim: THIS WAS REALLY A
BROAD RANGE OF INTELLIGENCE
ACTIVITIES.

09:58.331 --> 10:04.270
>> Frey: IT WAS A VERY BROAD
RANGE AND THEY DID IT ALL
GENERALLY IN EIGHT WEEKS.
>> Wertheim: WHAT YOU DESCRIBE,

10:04.337 --> 10:10.276
IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE THESE WERE
PRECURSORS TO C.I.A. AGENTS.
>> Frey: THEY WERE, IN FACT.
SOME OF THEM WERE TRAINED AS

10:10.343 --> 10:16.282
SPIES AND SOME OF THEM WENT ON
TO CAREERS AS SPIES.
>> Victor Brombert: MY PARENTS
WERE PACIFISTS, SO THE IDEA OF

10:16.349 --> 10:26.359
MY GOING TO WAR WAS FOR THEM
CALAMITOUS, HOWEVER THEY
REALIZED THAT IT WAS A NECESSARY
WAR, ESPECIALLY FOR US.

10:26.425 --> 10:33.132
>> Wertheim: VICTOR BROMBERT,
NOW 98-YEARS-OLD, IS A FORMER
PROFESSOR OF ROMANCE LANGUAGES
AND LITERATURE AT YALE, AND THEN

10:33.199 --> 10:38.471
PRINCETON.
HE WAS BORN IN BERLIN TO A
RUSSIAN JEWISH FAMILY.
WHEN HITLER CAME TO POWER, THE

10:38.537 --> 10:46.278
BROMBERTS FLED TO FRANCE, AND
THEN TO THE U.S.
EAGER TO FIGHT THE NAZIS, HE,
TOO, JOINED THE ARMY.

10:46.345 --> 10:52.818
AFTER RECRUITERS FOUND OUT HE
SPOKE FOUR LANGUAGES, THEY
DISPATCHED HIM TO CAMP RITCHIE,
WHERE STRENUOUS CLASSROOM

10:52.885 --> 11:02.762
INSTRUCTION WAS COUPLED WITH
STRENUOUS FIELD EXERCISES.
>> Brombert: THERE WERE LONG AND
DEMANDING EXERCISES AND CLOSE

11:02.828 --> 11:10.336
COMBAT TRAINING.
"HOW TO KILL A SENTRY FROM
BEHIND."
I THOUGHT, "I'M NEVER GOING TO

11:10.403 --> 11:14.874
DO THAT," BUT I WAS SHOWN HOW TO
DO IT.
>> Wertheim: SO PHYSICAL COMBAT
TRAINING AS WELL AS

11:14.940 --> 11:18.811
INTELLIGENCE?
>> Brombert: YES, WELL, WITH A
STICK.
YOU SORT OF SWING IT AROUND THE

11:18.878 --> 11:26.218
NECK FROM BEHIND AND THEN PULL.
>> Wertheim: AMONG THE UNUSUAL
SIGHTS AT RITCHIE: A TEAM OF
U.S. SOLDIERS DRESSED IN GERMAN

11:26.285 --> 11:32.525
UNIFORMS.
THE RITCHIE BOYS TRAINED FOR WAR
AGAINST THESE FAKE GERMANS WITH
FAKE GERMAN TANKS MADE OUT OF

11:32.591 --> 11:40.199
WOOD.
ANOTHER UNUSUAL SIGHT: TOWERING
OVER RECRUITS, FRANK LEAVITT, A
WORLD WAR I VETERAN AND PRO

11:40.266 --> 11:46.338
WRESTLING STAR AT THE TIME, WAS
AMONG THE INSTRUCTORS.
TRAINING WAS DESIGNED TO BE AS
REALISTIC AS POSSIBLE.

11:46.405 --> 11:52.912
THE RITCHIE BOYS PRACTICED
STREET FIGHTING IN LIFE-SIZE
REPLICAS OF GERMAN VILLAGES, AND
QUESTIONED MOCK CIVILIANS IN

11:52.978 --> 12:01.020
FULL SCALE GERMAN HOMES.
SOME OF THE PRISONERS WERE
ACTUAL GERMAN P.O.W.s BROUGHT TO
CAMP RITCHIE SO THE RITCHIE BOYS

12:01.087 --> 12:06.459
COULD PRACTICE THEIR
INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES.
I UNDERSTAND YOU, YOU HAD
SPARRING PARTNERS.

12:06.525 --> 12:13.966
YOU PLAYACTED--
>> Brombert: ONE HAD TO PLAYACT
WITH SOME OF THE PEOPLE WERE
ACTING AS PRISONERS AND SOME OF

12:14.033 --> 12:20.873
THEM WERE REAL PRISONERS.
>> Wertheim: BY THE SPRING OF
1944, THE RITCHIE BOYS WERE
READY TO RETURN TO WESTERN

12:20.940 --> 12:28.414
EUROPE, THIS TIME AS NATURALIZED
AMERICANS IN AMERICAN UNIFORMS.
STILL, IF THEY WERE CAPTURED,
THEY KNEW WHAT THE NAZIS WOULD

12:28.481 --> 12:37.089
DO TO THEM.
SOME OF THEM REQUESTED NEW DOG
TAGS, WITH VERY GOOD REASON.
THIS DOG TAG SAYS HEBREW.

12:37.156 --> 12:42.528
DID YOUR DOG TAG IDENTIFY YOU AS
JEWISH?
>> Stern: I PREFERRED NOT HAVING
IT.

12:42.595 --> 12:46.632
I ASKED THEM TO LEAVE IT OFF
>> Wertheim: YOU DIDN'T WANT TO
BE IDENTIFIED AS JEWISH GOING
BACK TO WESTERN EUROPE.

12:46.699 --> 12:58.410
>> Stern: NO BECAUSE I KNEW THAT
THE CONTACT WITH GERMANS MIGHT
NOT BE VERY NICE.
>> Wertheim: ON JUNE 6, 1944, D-

12:58.477 --> 13:06.585
DAY, THE ALLIES LAUNCHED ONE OF
THE MOST SWEEPING MILITARY
OPERATIONS IN HISTORY.
A MIGHTY ONSLAUGHT OF MORE THAN

13:06.652 --> 13:18.564
160,000 MEN, 13,000 AIRCRAFT,
AND 5,000 VESSELS.
>> Stern: WE WERE ON A P.T. BOAT
TAKING OFF FROM SOUTHAMPTON.

13:18.631 --> 13:26.572
AND WE ALL WERE SCARED.
WE WERE BRIEFED THAT THE GERMANS
WERE NOT GOING TO WELCOME US
GREATLY.

13:26.639 --> 13:34.480
AS A JEW, I KNEW I MIGHT NOT BE
TREATED EXACTLY BY THE GENEVA
RULES.
>> Wertheim: DIVIDED INTO SIX-

13:34.547 --> 13:40.486
MAN TEAMS, THE RITCHIE BOYS WERE
ATTACHED TO DIFFERENT ARMY
UNITS.
THEIR JOB: TO PROVIDE

13:40.553 --> 13:46.692
BATTLEFIELD INTELLIGENCE.
WHEN THEY LANDED ON THE BEACHES
OF NORMANDY, WEHRMACHT TROOPS
WERE WAITING FOR THEM, WELL-

13:46.759 --> 13:54.567
ARMED AND WELL PREPARED.
VICTOR BROMBERT WAS WITH THE
FIRST AMERICAN ARMORED DIVISION
TO LAND ON OMAHA BEACH.

13:54.633 --> 14:02.007
HE IS STILL HAUNTED BY WHAT HE
EXPERIENCED THAT DAY.
>> Brombert: I SAW IMMENSE
DEBRIS.

14:02.074 --> 14:10.382
WOUNDED PEOPLE.
DEAD PEOPLE.
I REMEMBER BEING UP ON A CLIFF
THE FIRST NIGHT OVER OMAHA

14:10.449 --> 14:18.657
BEACH.
AND WE WERE STRAFED AND I SAID
TO MYSELF, UH, "NOW, IT'S THE
END," BECAUSE I COULD- YOU COULD

14:18.724 --> 14:25.998
FEEL THE MACHINE GUN BULLETS.
>> Wertheim: IS THAT WHEN YOU
FIRST REALIZE- I'M- I'M IN A WAR
HERE?

14:26.065 --> 14:33.973
>> Brombert: YES, I REALIZED
THAT I WAS AFRAID.
I NEVER CALCULATED THAT THERE IS
SUCH A THING AS TERROR, FEAR.

14:34.039 --> 14:40.179
SO, I EXPERIENCED VISCERALLY,
FEAR.
>> Wertheim: ON THE FRONT LINES
FROM NORMANDY ONWARDS, THE

14:40.246 --> 14:46.185
RITCHIE BOYS FOUGHT IN EVERY
MAJOR BATTLE IN EUROPE,
COLLECTING TACTICAL
INTELLIGENCE, INTERROGATING

14:46.252 --> 14:52.524
PRISONERS AND CIVILIANS, ALL IN
SERVICE OF WINNING THE WAR.
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL HEAR
ABOUT SOME OF THE SURPRISING

14:52.591 --> 15:03.002
WAYS THEY FORGED CONNECTIONS
WITH THE ENEMY IN ORDER TO
EXTRACT STRATEGIC INFORMATION.

15:04.903 --> 15:12.311
>> Wertheim: IN 1944, THE
RITCHIE BOYS HEADED TO EUROPE TO
FIGHT IN A WAR THAT WAS FOR
THEM, INTENSELY PERSONAL.

15:12.378 --> 15:18.917
THEY WERE MEMBERS OF A SECRET
GROUP WHOSE MASTERY OF THE
GERMAN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
HELPED THEM PROVIDE BATTLEFIELD

15:18.984 --> 15:26.191
INTELLIGENCE THAT PROVED PIVOTAL
TO THE ALLIES' VICTORY.
THE RITCHIE BOYS LANDED ON THE
BEACHES OF NORMANDY ON D-DAY,

15:26.258 --> 15:31.063
AND HELPED LIBERATE PARIS.
THEY CROSSED INTO GERMANY WITH
THE ALLIED ARMIES AND WITNESSED
THE HORRORS OF THE NAZI

15:31.130 --> 15:38.304
CONCENTRATION CAMPS.
ALL THE WHILE, THEY TRACKED DOWN
EVIDENCE AND INTERROGATED NAZI
CRIMINALS, LATER TRIED AT

15:38.370 --> 15:46.812
NUREMBERG.
IT WAS ALSO IN EUROPE THAT SOME
OF THEM, LIKE GUY STERN, LEARNED
WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE

15:46.879 --> 15:51.083
FAMILIES THEY LEFT BEHIND.
>><i> THIS IS IT.</i>
<i>THEY'RE ON THE BEACH.</i>
>> Wertheim: BY THE SUMMER OF

15:51.150 --> 15:58.424
1944, GERMAN TROOPS IN NORMANDY
WERE OUTNUMBERED AND
OVERPOWERED.
THE ALLIES LIBERATED PARIS IN

15:58.490 --> 16:04.463
AUGUST.
>><i> THE DATE WAS AUGUST 25.</i>
>> Wertheim: AND DROVE NAZI
TROOPS OUT OF FRANCE.

16:04.530 --> 16:10.903
BUT HITLER WAS DETERMINED TO
CONTINUE THE WAR.
IN THE ARDENNES REGION OF
BELGIUM, THE GERMANS MOUNTED A

16:10.969 --> 16:16.909
MASSIVE COUNTEROFFENSIVE, WHICH
BECAME KNOWN AS "THE BATTLE OF
THE BULGE."
I SEE A TENT IN THE BACKGROUND

16:16.975 --> 16:21.847
OF THAT PHOTO RIGHT IN FRONT OF
YOU.
>> Stern: YES, THAT'S MY
INTERROGATION TENT.

16:21.914 --> 16:25.718
>> Wertheim: SO, THIS IS YOU ON
THE JOB.
YOU'RE IN BELGIUM?
>> Stern: YES, DOING MY JOB

16:25.784 --> 16:30.989
INTERROGATING.
RIGHT.
>> Wertheim: AMID THE CHAOS OF
WAR, GUY STERN AND THE OTHER

16:31.056 --> 16:38.964
RITCHIE BOYS HAD A JOB TO DO.
EMBEDDED IN EVERY ARMY UNIT,
THEY INTERROGATED TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF CAPTURED NAZI

16:39.031 --> 16:46.872
SOLDIERS AS WELL AS CIVILIANS,
EXTRACTING KEY STRATEGIC
INFORMATION ON ENEMY STRENGTH,
TROOP MOVEMENTS, AND DEFENSIVE

16:46.939 --> 16:52.878
POSITIONS.
THEY THEN TYPED UP THEIR DAILY
REPORTS IN THE FIELD TO BE
PASSED UP THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.

16:52.945 --> 17:03.055
>> Brombert: OUR INTERROGATIONS,
IT HAD TO DO WITH TACTICAL
IMMEDIATE CONCERNS.
AND THAT'S WHY CIVILIANS COULD

17:03.122 --> 17:10.262
BE USEFUL AND SOLDIERS COULD BE
USEFUL.
"WHERE IS THE MINEFIELD?"
VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU SAVE

17:10.329 --> 17:16.935
LIFE IF YOU KNOW WHERE THE MINE.
"WHERE IS THE MACHINE GUN NEST?"
"HOW MANY MACHINE GUNS DO YOU
HAVE THERE?"

17:17.002 --> 17:23.208
"WHERE ARE YOUR RESERVE UNITS?"
AND IF YOU DON'T GET IT FROM ONE
PRISONER, YOU MIGHT GET IT FROM
THE OTHER.

17:23.275 --> 17:30.716
>> Wertheim: 98-YEAR-OLD VICTOR
BROMBERT SAYS THEY RELIED ON
THIR CAMP RITCHIE TRAINING TO
GET PEOPLE TO OPEN UP.

17:30.783 --> 17:38.490
>> Brombert: WE IMPROVISED
ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION,
ACCORDING TO THE KIND OF UNIT,
ACCORDING TO THE KIND OF PERSON

17:38.557 --> 17:46.965
WE WERE INTERROGATING.
BUT CERTAINLY WHAT DID NOT WORK
WAS VIOLENCE OR THREAT OF
VIOLENCE.

17:47.032 --> 17:53.839
NEVER.
WHAT DID WORK IS COMPLICITY.
>> Wertheim: WHAT-- WHAT DO YOU
MEAN?

17:53.906 --> 17:58.477
>> Brombert: BY COMPLICITY I
MEAN, "OH, WE ARE TOGETHER IN
THIS WAR.
YOU ON ONE SIDE AND WE ON THIS

17:58.544 --> 18:05.050
SIDE.
ISN'T IT A MISERABLE THING?
AREN'T WE ALL, SORT OF, TIRED OF
IT?"

18:05.117 --> 18:09.621
>> Wertheim: THE SHARED
EXPERIENCE?
>> Brombert: THE SHARED
EXPERIENCE, EXACTLY.

18:09.688 --> 18:17.029
GIVING OUT SOME CIGARETTES ALSO
HELPS A LOT.
A FRIENDLY APPROACH.
TRYING TO BE HUMAN.

18:17.095 --> 18:23.035
>> Wertheim: THE RITCHIE BOYS
CONNECTED WITH PRISONERS ON
SUBJECTS AS VARIED AS FOOD AND
SOCCER RIVALRIES, BUT THEY

18:23.101 --> 18:29.575
WEREN'T ABOVE USING DECEPTION ON
DIFFICULT TARGETS.
THE RITCHIE BOYS DISCOVERED THAT
THE NAZIS WERE TERRIFIED OF

18:29.641 --> 18:38.250
ENDING UP IN RUSSIAN CAPTIVITY,
AND THEY USED THAT TO GREAT
EFFECT.
IF A GERMAN P.O.W. WOULDN'T

18:38.317 --> 18:47.593
TALK, HE MIGHT FACE GUY STERN
DRESSED UP AS A RUSSIAN OFFICER.
>> Stern: I HAD MY WHOLE UNIFORM
WITH MEDALS, RUSSIAN MEDALS, AND

18:47.659 --> 18:55.100
I GAVE MYSELF THE NAME
"COMMISSAR KRUKOV."
>> Wertheim: THAT'S WHAT YOU
CALLED YOURSELF?

18:55.167 --> 19:00.706
>> Stern: THAT WAS MY PSEUDONYM.
>> Wertheim: HOW DID YOU DO
COMMISSAR?
>> Stern: THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

19:00.772 --> 19:11.116
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
I GAVE MYSELF ALL THE
ACCOUTERMENTS OF LOOKING LIKE A
FIERCE RUSSIAN COMMISSAR.

19:11.183 --> 19:23.095
AND SOME WE DIDN'T BREAK, BUT
80% WERE SO DARNED SCARED OF THE
RUSSIANS AND WHAT THEY WOULD DO.
>> Wertheim: SO, THERE'S A REAL

19:23.161 --> 19:33.372
ELEMENT OF COSTUMES AND
DECEPTION AND ACCENTS.
>> Stern: YES, AND IT'S
THEATRICS IN A WAY, YES.

19:33.438 --> 19:39.177
>> Wertheim: THEIR SUBJECTS
RANGED FROM LOW LEVEL GERMAN
SOLDIERS TO HIGH RANKING NAZI
OFFICERS, INCLUDING HANS

19:39.244 --> 19:47.119
GOEBBELS, BROTHER OF HITLER'S
CHIEF PROPOGANDIST, JOSEPH
GOEBBELS.
ANOTHER BIT OF INDISPENSABLE

19:47.185 --> 19:55.193
RITCHIE BOY HANDIWORK: THE ORDER
OF BATTLE OF THE GERMAN ARMY.
PAUL FAIRBROOK HELPED WRITE THIS
COMPACT MANUAL, KNOWN AS "THE

19:55.260 --> 20:03.168
RED BOOK," WHICH OUTLINED IN
GREAT DETAIL THE MAKEUP OF
VIRTUALLY EVERY NAZI UNIT,
INFORMATION EVERY RITCHIE BOY

20:03.235 --> 20:07.506
COMMITTED TO MEMORY.
>> Fairbrook: WHEN THE SOLDIERS
SAID, "I'M NOT GOING TO TALK,"
THEY COULD SAY, "WAIT A MINUTE.

20:07.573 --> 20:13.712
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU.
LOOK, I GOT A BOOK HERE AND IT
TELLS ME THAT YOU WERE HERE AND
YOU WENT THERE AND YOUR BOSS WAS

20:13.779 --> 20:17.316
THIS."
AND THEY WERE IMPRESSED WITH
THAT
>> Wertheim: SO, IT SOUNDS LIKE

20:17.382 --> 20:25.157
THIS GAVE THE OFFICERS IN THE
FIELD A GUIDE TO THE GERMAN ARMY
SO THEY COULD THEN INTERROGATE
THE GERMAN P.O.W.s MORE

20:25.223 --> 20:29.094
EFFICIENTLY.
>> Fairbrook: THAT'S EXACTLY
RIGHT.
>> Wertheim: THE RITCHIE BOYS

20:29.161 --> 20:37.869
EARNED A REPUTATION FOR
DELIVERING IMPORTANT TACTICAL
INFORMATION FAST, MAKING A MAJOR
CONTRIBUTION TO EVERY BATTLE ON

20:37.936 --> 20:43.175
THE WESTERN FRONT.
>> Frey: THE WORK THEY DO IN THE
FIELD, BEING ABLE TO GLEAN
INFORMATION SIMPLY BY, FROM THE

20:43.241 --> 20:51.450
UNIFORM THAT A CAPTURED P.O.W.
IS WEARING OR THE TYPE OF WEAPON
THAT THEY HAVE OR THE UNIT THAT
THEY'VE JUST CAPTURED.

20:51.516 --> 20:59.324
THAT INFORMATION IS OF CRITICAL
IMPORTANCE BECAUSE IT TELLS YOU
WHERE CERTAIN UNITS ARE, AND IF
YOU KNOW WHERE CERTAIN UNITS

20:59.391 --> 21:05.163
ARE, YOU KNOW WHERE THE WEAK
SPOTS ARE.
YOU KNOW WHERE THE STRONG POINTS
ARE, AND YOU KNOW YOU WHAT TO

21:05.230 --> 21:11.803
AVOID AND WHAT TO ATTACK.
>> Wertheim: DAVID FREY TEACHES
HISTORY TO CADETS AT THE U.S.
MILITARY ACADEMY AT WEST POINT.

21:11.870 --> 21:18.276
>> Frey: THIS IS WHERE THE
HAVING AN INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
FROM CAMP RITCHIE WAS OF
CRITICAL IMPORTANCE, BECAUSE

21:18.343 --> 21:23.181
THEY WOULD KNOW THIS
INFORMATION.
YOUR AVERAGE COMMANDER IN THE
FIELD MIGHT NOT.

21:23.248 --> 21:29.187
>> Wertheim: THEIR WORK SAVED
LIVES?
>> Frey: ABSOLUTELY.
THEY CERTAINLY SAVED LIVES.

21:29.254 --> 21:35.527
I THINK THAT'S QUANTIFIABLE.
PART OF WHAT THE RITCHIE BOYS
DID WAS TO CONVINCE GERMAN UNITS
TO SURRENDER WITHOUT FIGHTING.

21:35.594 --> 21:39.264
>> Wertheim: AND YOU'RE SAYING
THAT SOME OF THAT ORIGINATED AT
CAMP RITCHIE?
>> Frey: MUCH OF IT ORIGINATED

21:39.331 --> 21:45.103
AT CAMP RITCHIE BECAUSE IT HAD
NEVER- IT HADN'T BEEN DONE
BEFORE.
HOW DO YOU APPEAL TO PEOPLE IN

21:45.170 --> 21:51.109
THEIR OWN LANGUAGE?
KNOWING HOW TO SHAPE THAT APPEAL
WAS PRETTY CRITICAL TO THE
SUCCESS OF THE MOBILE BROADCAST

21:51.176 --> 21:57.382
UNITS.
>> Wertheim: IN TRUCKS EQUIPPED
WITH LOUDSPEAKERS, RITCHIE BOYS
WENT TO THE FRONT LINES UNDER

21:57.449 --> 22:04.990
HEAVY FIRE, AND TRIED, IN
GERMAN, TO PERSUADE THEIR NAZI
COUNTERPARTS TO SURRENDER.
THEY ALSO DRAFTED AND DROPPED

22:05.057 --> 22:10.262
LEAFLETS FROM AIRPLANES BEHIND
ENEMY LINES.
>> Wertheim: THIS WAS ONE OF THE
LEAFLETS THAT WAS DROPPED OUT.

22:10.328 --> 22:19.304
>> Stern: OUT OF A PLANE.
I HAVE SOME THAT WERE SHOT.
THIS ONE WAS OUR MOST EFFECTIVE
LEAFLET.

22:19.371 --> 22:29.247
AND WHY WAS THAT?
BECAUSE EISENHOWER HAD SIGNED IT
AND THE GERMANS HAD AN
INCREDIBLY NAIÏVE APPROACH TO

22:29.314 --> 22:36.621
EVERYTHING THAT WAS SIGNED AND
SEALED.
>> Wertheim: AND YOU THINK
BECAUSE IT HAD THAT SIGNATURE,

22:36.688 --> 22:43.295
SOMEHOW THAT CERTIFIED IT.
>> Stern: YES, THAT CARRIED
WEIGHT, AND THE BELIEF IN THE
PRINTED MATTER WAS VERY GREAT.

22:43.361 --> 22:47.399
>> Wertheim: THAT'S THE KIND OF
THING YOU WOULD KNOW.
>> Stern: YES.
>> Wertheim: AS A FORMER GERMAN

22:47.466 --> 22:52.838
WHO UNDERSTOOD THE PSYCHOLOGY
AND THE MENTALITY.
>> Stern: THAT'S CORRECT.
>> Wertheim: APART FROM THE

22:52.904 --> 22:58.310
FIGHTING, THERE WERE OTHER
THREATS CONFRONTING THE RITCHIE
BOYS.
GIVEN THEIR FOREIGN ACCENTS,

22:58.376 --> 23:03.615
THEY WERE IN PARTICULAR DANGER
OF BEING MISTAKEN FOR THE ENEMY
BY THEIR OWN TROOPS, WHO
INSTITUTED PASSWORDS AT

23:03.682 --> 23:10.122
CHECKPOINTS.
>> Brombert: WHAT HAPPENED TO
ONE OF THE RITCHIE BOYS-- AT
NIGHT ON THE WAY TO THE LATRINE,

23:10.188 --> 23:14.526
HE WAS ASKED FOR A PASSWORD AND
HE GAVE THE NAME, THE WORD FOR
THE PASSWORD, BUT WITH A GERMAN
ACCENT.

23:14.593 --> 23:18.697
HE WAS SHOT RIGHT AWAY AND
KILLED.
>> Wertheim: DID YOU EVER WORRY
YOUR ACCENT MIGHT GET YOU

23:18.764 --> 23:26.705
KILLED?
>> Brombert: YES, OF COURSE.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T TALK LIKE AN
ALABAMA PERSON OR A TEXAN.

23:26.772 --> 23:31.977
>> Wertheim: SOME RITCHIE BOYS
WERE RECRUITED TO GO ON SECRET
MISSIONS DURING THE WAR.
97-YEAR-OLD MAX LERNER, AN

23:32.043 --> 23:39.384
AUSTRIAN JEW FLUENT IN GERMAN
AND FRENCH, SERVED AS A SPECIAL
AGENT WITH THE
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE CORPS,

23:39.451 --> 23:46.091
PASSING INFORMATION TO FRENCH
UNDERGROUND RESISTANCE GROUPS.
YOU WERE TRAINED AS A SPY?
>> Max Lerner: YES.

23:46.158 --> 23:53.165
>> Wertheim: WHAT WERE YOU
TRAINED TO DO?
>> Lerner: WEAR CIVILIAN
CLOTHES, PASS MESSAGES, KILL.

23:53.231 --> 23:59.337
>> Wertheim: THIS IS GOING
BEHIND ENEMY LINES.
I MEAN, THIS IS YOU'RE TAKING
YOUR LIFE IN YOUR HANDS HERE.

23:59.404 --> 24:05.410
>> Lerner: WELL, IT WAS A WAR.
>> Wertheim: THAT'S HOW YOU
LOOKED AT IT.
>> Lerner: IT WAS MY WAR.

24:05.477 --> 24:13.185
AND I NEEDED TO GET MY OWN BACK.
I WANTED DESPERATELY TO DO
SOMETHING.
>> Wertheim: AT ONE POINT, MAX

24:13.251 --> 24:19.457
LERNER DISGUISED HIMSELF AS A
GERMAN OFFICER AND SNUCK BEHIND
ENEMY LINES, LEADING A TEAM OF
AMERICAN SOLDIERS INTO A GERMAN

24:19.524 --> 24:26.298
DEPOT AT NIGHT AND DESTROYING
THE EQUIPMENT.
DID YOU WORRY WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
IF YOU WERE CAPTURED?

24:26.364 --> 24:29.768
>> Lerner: I WASN'T SMART
ENOUGH.
>> Wertheim: WHAT DO YOU SUSPECT
MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED?

24:29.835 --> 24:35.407
>> Lerner: OH, I WOULD HAVE BEEN
KILLED.
>> Wertheim: BY THE SPRING OF
1945, ALLIED FORCES NEARED

24:35.473 --> 24:42.714
BERLIN AND HITLER TOOK HIS LIFE
IN HIS UNDERGROUND BUNKER.
GERMANY SURRENDERED ON MAY 8 OF
THAT YEAR.

24:42.781 --> 24:50.589
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER FEELING
THAT DAY?
>> Stern: ELATED.
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY, "WE WON,

24:50.655 --> 24:55.460
KID!"
(.LAUGHS )
>> Wertheim: AND THOSE ARE YOUR,
THOSE ARE YOUR COMRADES?

24:55.527 --> 24:59.364
>> Stern: YES.
>> Wertheim: THOSE ARE YOUR
GUYS.
>> Stern: YES.

24:59.431 --> 25:07.505
>> Wertheim: BUT JOY TURNED TO
HORROR AS ALLIED SOLDIERS AND
THE WORLD LEARNED THE FULL SCALE
OF THE NAZI MASS EXTERMINATION.

25:07.572 --> 25:15.480
GUY STERN RECALLS ARRIVING AT
BUCHENWALD CONCENTRATION CAMP
THREE DAYS AFTER ITS LIBERATION,
ALONGSIDE A FELLOW AMERICAN

25:15.547 --> 25:26.024
SERGEANT.
>> Stern: WE WERE WALKING ALONG
AND YOU SAW THESE EMACIATED,
HORRIBLY LOOKING, CLOSE TO DEATH

25:26.091 --> 25:37.569
PEOPLE.
AND SO, I FELL BACK BEHIND,
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE SEEN
CRYING TO A HARDENED SOLDIER,

25:37.636 --> 25:51.516
AND THEN HE LOOKED AROUND TO
LOOK WHERE I WAS, HOW I WAS
DELAYED, AND HE, THIS GOOD
FELLOW FROM MIDDLE OF OHIO, WAS

25:51.583 --> 25:59.457
BAWLING JUST AS I WAS.
>> Wertheim: A FEW DAYS LATER,
STERN RETURNED TO THE PLACE OF
HIS BIRTH, HOPING TO REUNITE

25:59.524 --> 26:07.565
WITH HIS FAMILY.
BUT HILDESHEIM WAS NOW IN RUINS.
A CHILDHOOD FRIEND DESCRIBED TO
STERN HOW HIS PARENTS, YOUNGER

26:07.632 --> 26:15.340
BROTHER AND SISTER HAD BEEN
FORCED FROM THEIR HOME AND
DEPORTED.
>> Stern: THEY WERE KILLED

26:15.407 --> 26:23.415
EITHER IN WARSAW OR IN
AUSCHWITZ.
NONE OF MY FAMILY SURVIVED.
I WAS THE ONLY ONE TO GET OUT.

26:23.481 --> 26:29.521
>> Wertheim: DID YOU EVER ASK
YOURSELF, "WHY ME?"
WHY WERE YOU THE ONE THAT MADE
IT TO THE UNITED STATES?

26:29.587 --> 26:43.568
>> Stern: YES, EVEN LAST NIGHT.
AND I SAID "WELL, HUH, IN SLANG,
THERE AIN'T NOTHING SPECIAL
ABOUT YOU, BUT IF YOU WERE

26:43.635 --> 26:55.580
SAVED, YOU GOT TO SHOW THAT YOU
WERE WORTHY OF IT.
AND THAT HAS BEEN THE DRIVING
FORCE IN MY LIFE.

26:55.647 --> 27:03.555
>> Wertheim: AS A WAY TO HONOR
YOUR FAMILY THAT PERISHED.
>> Stern: YEAH.
>> Wertheim: AFTER THE GERMAN

27:03.621 --> 27:11.162
ARMY'S SURRENDER, GUY STERN AND
THE OTHER RITCHIE BOYS TOOK ON A
NEW ASSIGNMENT: HUNTING DOWN TOP
NAZI OFFICERS RESPONSIBLE FOR

27:11.229 --> 27:16.101
THE ATROCITIES THAT KILLED SO
MANY, INCLUDING MANY OF THEIR
LOVED ONES.
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL HEAR

27:16.167 --> 27:23.608
ABOUT SOME OF THE SURPRISING
WAYS GUY STERN AND THE OTHER
RITCHIE BOYS WERE ABLE TO
IDENTIFY SUSPECTED NAZI WAR

27:23.675 --> 27:34.552
CRIMINALS, MANY OF WHOM LATER
STOOD TRIAL FOR CRIMES AGAINST
HUMANITY AT NUREMBERG.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

27:35.920 --> 27:44.162
(<i> TICKING</i> )
>> Wertheim: THE RITCHIE BOYS
WERE MEMBERS OF A SECRET
AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE GROUP

27:44.229 --> 27:50.935
WHOSE MASTERY OF THE GERMAN
LANGUAGE AND CULTURE PROVED
CRITICAL TO THE ALLIES' VICTORY
OVER HITLER.

27:51.002 --> 27:58.343
MANY OF THEM WERE JEWISH
REFUGEES FROM EUROPE, WHO FLED
THEIR HOMELAND, CAME TO AMERICA
AND JOINED THE U.S. ARMY.

27:58.410 --> 28:05.850
AFTER HITLER'S DEFEAT, MANY OF
THEM TOOK ON A CHALLENGING NEW
ASSIGNMENT: USING THEIR LANGUAGE
AND INTERROGATION SKILLS TO FIND

28:05.917 --> 28:11.756
AND ARREST TOP NAZI WAR
CRIMINALS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE
GREATEST CONTRIBUTION OF THE

28:11.823 --> 28:23.902
RITCHIE BOYS?
>> Stern: I THINK IT WAS THE
CONTINUOUS FLOW OF RELIABLE
INFORMATION THAT REALLY HELPED

28:23.968 --> 28:31.910
EXPEDITE THE END OF THE WAR.
>> Wertheim: THIS HAD A REAL
MATERIAL IMPACT ON WORLD WAR II.
>> Stern: YES

28:31.976 --> 28:39.984
>> Wertheim: FOR 99-YEAR-OLD GUY
STERN, A GERMAN JEW WHOSE ENTIRE
FAMILY WAS KILLED BY THE NAZIS,
THE ALLIES' VICTORY OVER HITLER

28:40.051 --> 28:47.892
WAS THE CULMINATION OF A PUBLIC
CRUSADE AND A PRIVATE ONE AS
WELL.
>> Stern: DEFEATING THE

28:47.959 --> 29:03.441
WEHRMACHT AND THE WAFFEN S.S.
AND ALL THE FANCY TROOPS THEY
HAD WAS A SATISFACTION BOTH AS A
TEAM MEMBER AND AS A PERSONAL

29:03.508 --> 29:15.587
SATISFACTION.
THE VERY ASPECT OF THESE S.O.B.s
NOW BEING AT MY COMMAND--
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )

29:15.653 --> 29:21.926
GAVE ME ALSO SOME PERSONAL
SATISFACTION.
>> Wertheim: AFTER GERMANY'S
SURRENDER, THE RITCHIE BOYS TOOK

29:21.993 --> 29:27.999
ON THE DIFFICULT TASK OF
IDENTIFYING AND TRACKING DOWN
NAZI CRIMINALS.
LONGTIME YALE AND PRINCETON

29:28.066 --> 29:38.176
PROFESSOR VICTOR BROMBERT HELPED
ENACT THE OFFICIAL ALLIED POLICY
OF REMOVING NAZI INFLUENCE FROM
GERMAN PUBLIC LIFE, KNOWN AS DE-

29:38.243 --> 29:46.851
NAZIFICATION.
SO, IN MAY OF 1945, GERMANY
SURRENDERS, AND YOU'RE ASSIGNED
TO THE DE-NAZIFICATION PROCESS.

29:46.918 --> 29:55.994
WHAT- WHAT DID THAT ENTAIL?
>> Brombert: WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
ARREST IMPORTANT NAZI OFFICIALS,
NOT JUST ANY NAZI PARTY MEMBER.

29:56.060 --> 30:05.970
IT WAS VERY, VERY HARD, VERY
DIFFICULT AND VERY RARE TO HAVE
A GERMAN DENOUNCE ANOTHER GERMAN
AT THAT POINT.

30:06.037 --> 30:15.246
NOW IS IT BECAUSE THEY WERE
AFRAID THAT THE NAZIS MIGHT COME
BACK, THAT IT'S NOT OVER?
OR IS IT JUST A HABIT OR HABIT

30:15.313 --> 30:22.420
OF OBEDIENCE OR DIGNITY?
I DON'T KNOW.
AND AT GREAT EFFORT WE FOUND
PEOPLE, WE ARRESTED THEM, WE

30:22.487 --> 30:28.493
WERE PROUD OF DOING THAT.
>> Wertheim: AS PART OF DE-
NAZIFICATION, PHOTOS OF NAZI
ATROCITIES WERE POSTED IN GERMAN

30:28.560 --> 30:37.936
SHOP WINDOWS AND RITCHIE BOYS
LED THE COUNTRY'S CITIZENS ON
TOURS OF THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS
TO EDUCATE THE LOCAL POPULATION

30:38.002 --> 30:43.975
ABOUT THE EVIL HITLER HAD
PERPETRATED.
SOMETIMES ENTIRE GERMAN TOWNS
WERE FORCED TO PAY RESPECTS TO

30:44.042 --> 30:51.382
THE DEAD.
MAX LERNER WAS ASSIGNED TO
INTERVIEW GERMAN CIVILIANS TO
HELP GAUGE THE DEGREE TO WHICH

30:51.449 --> 30:58.022
THEY HAD SERVED THE NAZI CAUSE
AND DETERMINE WHICH ONES SHOULD
BE PUNISHED.
I IMAGINE ALL OF A SUDDEN NO ONE

30:58.089 --> 31:03.127
WANTS TO ADMIT TO BEING A NAZI
>> Lerner: THERE WERE NO NAZIS.
THEY WERE ALL FORCED TO DO IT
>> Wertheim: THAT'S WHAT YOU

31:03.194 --> 31:06.231
WERE TOLD.
"I'M DENOUNCING THIS AND I WAS
FORCED TO DO IT."
>> Lerner: YES.

31:06.297 --> 31:14.706
THEY WERE ALL JUSTIFYING
THEMSELVES.
"IT WAS A TERRIBLE SITUATION.
AND I HAD NO CHOICE."

31:14.772 --> 31:20.111
"I HAD NO CHOICE."
THAT WAS THE MANTRA.
"I WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IF I
HADN'T GONE ALONG."

31:20.178 --> 31:26.084
>> Wertheim: DID YOU EVER
CONFRONT A NAZI WHO SAID "THIS
WAS MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE?
>> Lerner: NO.

31:26.150 --> 31:30.054
>> Wertheim: UNPRINCIPLED AND
DISHONORABLE AND I'M SORRY?
>> Lerner: NO.
>> Wertheim: NEVER?

31:30.121 --> 31:36.027
>> Lerner: NEVER.
>> Wertheim: ONE OF THE WAYS
THEY IDENTIFIED SUBJECTS WANTED
FOR INTERROGATION WAS BY

31:36.094 --> 31:42.033
CONSULTING THIS BOOK, "THE
CENTRAL REGISTRY OF WAR
CRIMINALS AND SECURITY
SUSPECTS," WHICH LISTED ENEMY

31:42.100 --> 31:50.975
NATIONALS SUSPECTED OF
COMMITTING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
WAR CRIMES IN EUROPE- EVERYONE
FROM LOW RANKING MEMBERS OF THE

31:51.042 --> 31:56.281
ARMED FORCES TO TOP NAZI
OFFICIALS.
TO ALLIED INVESTIGATORS IT
BECAME A SORT OF NAZI HUNTER'S

31:56.347 --> 32:02.320
BIBLE.
DID YOU ENJOY HUNTING NAZIS?
DID IT GIVE YOU ANY
SATISFACTION?

32:02.387 --> 32:08.326
>> Lerner: IT GAVE ME A GREAT
DEAL OF SATISFACTION.
"ENJOY" IS PERHAPS NOT THE RIGHT
WORD, BUT IT GAVE ME GREAT DEAL

32:08.393 --> 32:16.100
OF SATISFACTION.
>> Wertheim: WHY SPECIFICALLY?
>> Lerner: BECAUSE I REMEMBERED
MY PARENTS.

32:16.167 --> 32:24.108
MY FATHER WAS 49-YEARS-OLD AND,
AND MY MOTHER WAS 48, AND THEY
LEFT EVERYTHING THEY HAD BUILT
UP BEHIND, AND ARRIVED IN THE

32:24.175 --> 32:32.116
UNITED STATES PENNILESS.
>> Wertheim: AND YOU WERE ABLE
TO CONFRONT THE PEOPLE THAT HAD
CAUSED THIS, THIS TRAUMA.

32:32.183 --> 32:39.357
>> Lerner: YES.
>> Wertheim: ALL S.S. MEMBERS
WERE SUBJECT TO AUTOMATIC
ARREST.

32:39.424 --> 32:46.264
ESTABLISHED BY HITLER AND LED BY
HEINRICH HIMMLER, THE S.S. WAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURITY AND
INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION IN

32:46.331 --> 32:52.236
GERMANY.
THE S.S. CONTROLLED THE GERMAN
POLICE FORCES AND CONCENTRATION
CAMPS, AND DIRECTED THE SO-

32:52.303 --> 33:00.111
CALLED "FINAL SOLUTION" TO KILL
ALL EUROPEAN JEWS.
MAX LERNER RECALLS THAT IN ONE
RESPECT AT LEAST, IDENTIFYING

33:00.178 --> 33:08.186
MOST S.S. MEMBERS WAS EASY.
>> Lerner: YOU KNOW HOW TO TELL
AN S.S. MAN?
>> Wertheim: HOW?

33:08.252 --> 33:15.593
>> Lerner: THEY HAVE A TATTOO OF
THEIR BLOOD GROUP UNDER THEIR
LEFT ARMS.
>> Wertheim: S.S. MEN, YOU'RE

33:15.660 --> 33:20.198
SAYING, HAVE A TATTOO UNDER
THEIR LEFT ARM WITH THEIR BLOOD
TYPE?
>> Lerner: YES.

33:20.264 --> 33:27.105
OR THEY HAD AN EFFORT TO ERASE
IT.
>> Wertheim: THE PURPOSE OF THE
TATTOO WAS TO IDENTIFY A

33:27.171 --> 33:35.480
SOLDIER'S BLOOD TYPE IN CASE A
TRANSFUSION WAS NEEDED OR IF HIS
DOG TAGS WENT MISSING.
MAX LERNER RECALLS BEING PUT IN

33:35.546 --> 33:42.153
CHARGE OF ONE PROMINENT CAPTURED
GERMAN PRISONER AT A JAIL IN
WEISBADEN, GERMANY.
THAT WAS JULIUS STREICHER, THE

33:42.220 --> 33:48.226
FOUNDER AND EDITOR OF THE NAZI
PAPER "DER STUERMER" AND ONE OF
THE COUNTRY'S LEADING ANTI-
SEMITES.

33:48.292 --> 33:55.099
>> Lerner: HE SPENT SEVERAL DAYS
IN MY JAIL.
AND I MADE SURE HE KNEW THAT IT
WAS A JEW WHO CONTROLLED HIM.

33:55.166 --> 34:03.708
>> Wertheim: YOU LET HIM KNOW
YOU WERE JEWISH?
>> Lerner: OH, YES.
>> Wertheim: STRIECHER WAS LATER

34:03.775 --> 34:11.048
TRIED AND CONVICTED AT THE
INTERNATIONAL MILITARY TRIBUNAL
AT NUREMBERG, WHERE
CONCENTRATION CAMP SURVIVORS WHO

34:11.115 --> 34:16.554
BORE WITNESS TO THE MASS MURDER
FACED DOWN THEIR NAZI
TORMENTORS.
DOZENS OF RITCHIE BOYS WORKED AT

34:16.621 --> 34:23.394
THE NUREMBERG TRIALS AS
PROSECUTORS, INTERROGATORS AND
TRANSLATORS.
RITCHIE BOYS ALSO COLLECTED

34:23.461 --> 34:30.234
EVIDENCE WHICH LED TO THE
PROSECUTION OF MANY HIGH RANKING
NAZIS INCLUDING HERMANN GOERING,
HEAD OF THE LUFTWAFFE; RUDOLPH

34:30.301 --> 34:39.844
HESS, DEPUTY FURHER TO ADOLF
HITLER; AND WILHELM KEITEL,
CHIEF OF THE WEHRMACHT,
GERMANY'S ARMED FORCES.

34:39.911 --> 34:47.084
>><i> THE EVIDENCE RELATING TO WAR</i>
<i>CRIMES HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING IN</i>
<i>ITS VOLUME AND ITS DETAIL.</i>
>> Wertheim: ALL WERE CONVICTED

34:47.151 --> 34:52.356
FOR THEIR CRIMES, AND MANY WERE
EXECUTED.
AFTER THE WAR, GUY STERN AND THE
OTHER RITCHIE BOYS WERE

34:52.423 --> 35:00.665
CELEBRATED FOR THEIR
ACHIEVEMENTS.
>> Stern: THE BRONZE STAR WAS
GIVEN TO ME RIGHT AT THE END OF

35:00.731 --> 35:06.304
HOSTILITIES.
THIS IS THE GOOD CONDUCT MEDAL,
WHICH I'M NOT REALLY ENTITLED
TO.

35:06.370 --> 35:18.316
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
AND THIS HERE IS THE EUROPEAN
THEATRE OF OPERATIONS MEDAL WITH
FIVE BATTLES IN WHICH I

35:18.382 --> 35:23.221
PARTICIPATED.
>> Wertheim: DO YOU CONSIDER
YOURSELF A HERO?
>> Stern: GOD, NO.

35:23.287 --> 35:40.638
I TELL YOU, WHEN WE LANDED ON
OMAHA BEACH, THERE WERE THE
WHOLE HEIGHTS HAD BEEN OCCUPIED
BY THE GERMAN ARTILLERY.

35:40.705 --> 35:52.316
AND I LOOKED UP ON THOSE HEIGHTS
AND THERE WERE OUR AMERICAN
SOLDIERS IN FULL OCCUPATION ON
THE DAY-D PLUS THREE, AND I SAID

35:52.383 --> 36:06.364
TO MYSELF, "THAT CAN'T BE DONE."
AND TO TAKE THOSE HEIGHTS
AGAINST HEAVY FIRING, GOING UP
THOSE STEEP CLIFFS, AND OF

36:06.430 --> 36:15.406
COURSE, IT HAD BEEN DONE.
THE EVIDENCE WAS BEFORE US.
THOSE WERE THE HEROES.
>> Wertheim: GUY STERN RETURNED

36:15.473 --> 36:24.382
TO NORMANDY IN 2016 TO PAY HIS
RESPECTS TO THE MORE THAN 9,300
MEN BURIED IN THE AMERICAN
CEMETERY THERE, ON THE BLUFF

36:24.448 --> 36:32.390
OVERLOOKING THE HALLOWED BEACH.
DID THE RITCHIE BOYS REDEFINE
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A SOLDIER
AND CONTRIBUTE TO A MILITARY?

36:32.456 --> 36:36.827
>> Frey: I THINK THEY DID.
BECAUSE THEY SERVED IN SO MANY
DIFFERENT CAPACITIES.
>> Wertheim: HISTORY PROFESSOR

36:36.894 --> 36:44.402
DAVID FREY RUNS THE CENTER FOR
HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE STUDIES
AT THE U.S. MILITARY ACADEMY AT
WEST POINT.

36:44.468 --> 36:52.376
>> Frey: THERE WERE RITCHIE BOYS
THAT WERE IN THE FIRST WAVE ON
THE FIRST DAY AT D-DAY.
THERE WERE RITCHIE BOYS WHO WERE

36:52.443 --> 36:58.516
IN P.O.W. CAMPS EMBEDDED AND
GATHERING INFORMATION IN THE
UNITED STATES.
SOME DIDN'T EVEN GO OVER TO- TO

36:58.583 --> 37:04.455
EUROPE.
THERE WERE RITCHIE BOYS WHO WERE
IN VIRTUALLY EVERY BATTLE THAT
YOU CAN THINK OF, AND SOME

37:04.522 --> 37:09.493
ACTUALLY SUFFERED THE WORST
FATE.
THERE WERE TWO WHO WERE ACTUALLY
CAPTURED AT THE BATTLE OF THE

37:09.560 --> 37:15.066
BULGE.
AND WHEN THEIR IDENTITY WAS
DISCOVERED, THEY WERE SUMMARILY
EXECUTED BY THE GERMANS THAT HAD

37:15.132 --> 37:18.202
CAPTURED THEM.
>> Wertheim: BECAUSE THEY WERE
JEWISH?
>> Frey: BECAUSE THEY WERE

37:18.269 --> 37:24.442
JEWISH.
>> Wertheim: WEHRMACHT CAPTAIN
CURT BRUNS, CONVICTED BY A
MILITARY TRIBUNAL OF ORDERING

37:24.508 --> 37:34.385
THE MURDER OF THOSE TWO RITCHIE
BOYS, WAS EXECUTED BY A FIRING
SQUAD IN JUNE, 1945.
AFTER THE WAR, THE RITCHIE BOYS

37:34.452 --> 37:40.458
CONTINUED THEIR WORK.
98-YEAR-OLD PAUL FAIRBROOK
HELPED SET UP THE GERMAN
MILITARY DOCUMENTS SECTION AT

37:40.524 --> 37:48.432
CAMP RITCHIE, A VAST CATALOG OF
MORE THAN 20,000 CAPTURED GERMAN
DOCUMENTS.
>> Fairbrook: THEY SENT US BACK

37:48.499 --> 37:54.438
TO CAMP RITCHIE AND THEY CREATED
SOMETHING THAT I CALL THE
EQUIVALENT OF THE LIBRARY OF
CONGRESS.

37:54.505 --> 38:00.444
WE HAD TO- WE GOT A LOT OF
GERMAN PRISONERS WHO WERE
WILLING TO HELP US CATALOG ALL
THOSE DOCUMENTS.

38:00.511 --> 38:06.717
>> Wertheim: THE PROJECT
DETAILED EVERY ASPECT OF THE
GERMAN ARMY'S OPERATIONS DURING
THE WAR, INCLUDING HOW THEY WERE

38:06.784 --> 38:14.992
STRUCTURED, HOW THEY MOBILIZED
AND HOW THEY USED INTELLIGENCE.
THE U.S. WAR DEPARTMENT USED
THIS COLLECTION OF GERMAN

38:15.059 --> 38:20.698
DOCUMENTS TO STUDY GERMANY'S
BATTLES WITH THE SOVIETS ON THE
EASTERN FRONT, IN ORDER TO BE
BETTER PREPARED FOR ANY FUTURE

38:20.765 --> 38:28.305
CONFLICT WITH RUSSIA.
>> Wertheim: SO, THERE'S ALL
SORTS OF IMPACT YEARS AND YEARS
AND YEARS AFTER THE WAR FROM

38:28.372 --> 38:32.510
THIS, THIS CAMP IN MARYLAND?
>> Frey: RIGHT.
IT WAS NOT ONLY THAT SHORT TERM
IMPACT ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

38:32.576 --> 38:39.784
IT WAS AN IMPACT ON WAR CRIMES.
THEN SHAPING THE COLD WAR ERA,
THEY REALLY PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT
ROLE.

38:39.850 --> 38:47.525
>> Wertheim: AFTER THE WAR, GUY
STERN, VICTOR BROMBERT, PAUL
FAIRBROOK AND MAX LERNER CAME
HOME, MARRIED, AND WENT TO IVY

38:47.591 --> 38:53.030
LEAGUE SCHOOLS ON THE G.I.
BILL.
GUY STERN BECAME A PROFESSOR AND
TAUGHT FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS.

38:53.097 --> 39:00.504
THEY ALL ROSE TO THE TOP OF
THEIR FIELDS, AS DID A NUMBER OF
OTHER RITCHIE BOYS.
I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME

39:00.571 --> 39:05.876
RITCHIE BOYS, BECAME FAIRLY
PROMINENT FIGURES.
>> Frey: THERE ARE A WHOLE
VARIETY OF PROMINENT RITCHIE

39:05.943 --> 39:11.849
BOYS.
>> Wertheim: IT TURNS OUT THAT
AUTHOR J.D. SALINGER WAS A
RITCHIE BOY.

39:11.916 --> 39:18.556
SO WAS ARCHIBALD ROOSEVELT,
GRANDSON OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
AS WAS PHILANTHROPIST DAVID
ROCKEFELLER, AND MEDIA BARON AND

39:18.622 --> 39:24.562
BILLIONAIRE JOHN KLUGE.
>> Frey: SOME BECAME
AMBASSADORS.
OTHERS WERE ACTUALLY REALLY

39:24.628 --> 39:31.001
IMPORTANT IN AMERICAN SCIENCE.
>> Wertheim: AND NOTABLY,
PROFESSOR FREY SAYS, MORE THAN
250 RITCHIE BOYS CONTINUED TO

39:31.068 --> 39:38.576
WORK IN THE FIELD OF
INTELLIGENCE AFTER THE WAR,
BECOMING PROFESSIONAL SPIES.
>> Frey: MANY OF THOSE WHO

39:38.642 --> 39:47.251
TRAINED AT CAMP RITCHIE ACTUALLY
DID GO ON TO THE O.S.S., THE
PRECURSOR TO THE C.I.A., THAT
MEANT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO

39:47.318 --> 39:54.558
LEARNED THEIR CRAFT AT CAMP
RITCHIE PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT
ROLE IN SETTING UP WHAT
EVENTUALLY BECAME THE C.I.A.

39:54.625 --> 40:00.197
>> Wertheim: HOW DO YOU THINK WE
SHOULD BE RECALLING THE RITCHIE
BOYS?
>> Frey: I THINK WE LOOK AT THIS

40:00.264 --> 40:04.568
GROUP AND WE SEE TRUE HEROES.
WE SEE THOSE WHO ARE THE
GREATEST OF THE GREATEST
GENERATION.

40:04.635 --> 40:12.576
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO MADE
MASSIVE CONTRIBUTIONS, WHO
HELPED SHAPE WHAT IT MEANT TO BE
AMERICAN AND WHO, IN SOME CASES,

40:12.643 --> 40:18.582
GAVE THEIR LIVES IN SERVICE TO
THIS COUNTRY.
>> Wertheim: THIS-- THIS IS A
REMARKABLE STORY.

40:18.649 --> 40:24.588
WHY DO SO FEW AMERICANS KNOW
ABOUT THIS?
>> Frey: BECAUSE IT INVOLVES
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE, MUCH OF

40:24.655 --> 40:34.231
IT WAS ACTUALLY KEPT SECRET
UNTIL THE, THE 1990s.
A LOT OF WHAT WAS LEARNED AND
THE METHODS USED ARE IMPORTANT

40:34.298 --> 40:40.571
TO KEEP SECRET.
AND ONLY IN THE EARLY 2000s DID
WE BEGIN TO SEE REUNIONS OF THE
RITCHIE BOYS.

40:40.638 --> 40:48.579
>> Wertheim: NOW IN THEIR LATE
90s, THESE HUMBLE WARRIORS STILL
KEEP IN TOUCH, SWAPPING STORIES
ABOUT A CHAPTER IN AMERICAN

40:48.646 --> 40:56.921
HISTORY NOW FINALLY BEING TOLD.
WHAT IS IT LIKE WHEN YOU GET
TOGETHER AND REFLECT ON THIS
EXPERIENCE GOING ON 80 YEARS

40:56.987 --> 41:03.460
AGO?
>> Stern: WE ALWAYS FIND ANOTHER
ANECDOTE TO TELL.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )

41:03.527 --> 41:08.666
>> Wertheim: YOU HAVE A SMILE ON
YOUR FACE WHEN YOU THINK BACK.
>> Stern: YES, THIS IS WHAT
HAPPENS.

41:08.732 --> 41:16.073
>> Wertheim: IT WAS HARD FOR US
NOT TO NOTICE THAT BEYOND THE
STORIES RUNS A DEEP SENSE OF
PRIDE.

41:16.140 --> 41:20.644
>> Fairbrook: YOU BET YOUR LIFE
I'M PROUD OF THE RITCHIE BOYS.
IT WAS WONDERFUL TO BE PART OF
THEM!

41:20.711 --> 41:28.652
I WAS PROUD TO BE IN THE
AMERICAN ARMY AND WE WERE ABLE
TO DO WHAT WE HAD TO DO.
I DON'T THINK WE'RE HEROES, BUT

41:28.719 --> 41:35.860
THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP FIGHT
AND WIN THE WAR WAS A WONDERFUL
WAY.
I CAN LOOK ANYBODY STRAIGHT IN

41:35.926 --> 41:40.664
THEIR EYE AND SAY I THINK I'VE
EARNED THE RIGHT TO BE AN
AMERICAN.
AND THAT'S WHAT, THAT'S WHAT IT

41:40.731 --> 41:46.503
DID FOR ME.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

41:47.638 --> 41:54.645
>><i> MORE FROM RITCHIE BOY GUY</i>
STERN.
>> Stern: THAT IS THE FRENCH
LEGION OF HONOR.

41:54.712 --> 42:03.220
>><i> AT 60minutesovertime.com.</i>

42:03.654 --> 42:08.192
>> Wertheim: I'M JON WERTHEIM.
THANKS FOR JOINING US.
WE'LL BE BACK NEXT WEEK WITH A
BRAND NEW EDITION OF "60

42:08.259 --> 42:16.133
MINUTES."
