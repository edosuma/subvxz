00:16.850 --> 00:19.937
Excuse me. Mrs. Johnson?
Nancy Johnson?

00:20.020 --> 00:21.605
-Hi...
-Excuse me. I don't. I--

00:21.689 --> 00:26.401
I... I'm Pat. Pat Knowler.
I write for the <i>Chicago Tribune.</i>

00:26.484 --> 00:28.486
I'm sorry, I...
I don't have anything to say to you.

00:28.571 --> 00:31.699
No. You don't have to say anything,
but please listen.

00:31.782 --> 00:35.327
I specialize in long-form
investigative reporting--

00:35.410 --> 00:37.079
Yeah, I've read the headlines.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.163
-No.
-"Michigan Miracle."

00:38.246 --> 00:39.582
No, that's not what I do.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.542
I help people like Prairie
tell their stories

00:41.625 --> 00:42.918
honestly and respectfully.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.753
Do you know what would be respectful?

00:45.462 --> 00:47.339
To let me go on shopping.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.972
I won the National Book Award for this.

00:55.055 --> 00:59.434
I'm only trying to say
that my work is not sensationalistic.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.979
-I spent eight months with that family.
-I don't care.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.148
Fifteen weeks on the <i>USA Today</i>
Best-Seller list.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.275
Jamie Price and his family
are set for life.

01:11.614 --> 01:15.909
Prairie... may never lead a normal life.

01:16.869 --> 01:19.913
And she probably
won't be able to get a job.

01:19.997 --> 01:22.958
I bet you burned through your savings
trying to find her.

01:23.041 --> 01:25.377
It happens to every family like you.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.544
We're fine.

01:27.671 --> 01:28.756
Thank you for your time,

01:28.839 --> 01:31.591
but if you change your mind,
my card is in there.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.093
I fly out tomorrow.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.283
Homer.

02:29.733 --> 02:32.861
I'm sorry, I should have asked.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.823
How long have you been a vegan?

02:35.906 --> 02:38.116
Oh, going on five years.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.578
But it's not a political
or spiritual decision.

02:41.662 --> 02:45.499
Uh, more of a shift
to wanting to take control

02:45.582 --> 02:47.417
of the kind of fuel that I...

02:49.502 --> 02:50.838
Honey, are you okay?

02:51.714 --> 02:53.966
- Burn your mouth?
- No, it's just...

02:55.133 --> 02:56.259
This is so good.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.179
Oh. I apologize.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.848
It's so insensitive of me
to talk about my...

03:01.932 --> 03:04.810
dietary decisions when Prairie--

03:04.893 --> 03:06.353
It's okay.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.774
You wrote the book about the boy?

03:10.858 --> 03:13.068
Jamie. Amazing young man.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.319
What is he like?

03:14.778 --> 03:18.240
He was only eight when he was abducted.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.868
Uh, 15 when he was rescued.

03:20.951 --> 03:23.996
Sometimes when you talk to him
he seems really young.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.956
And other times, really old.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.332
Nothing in between.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.252
What happened to him

03:30.335 --> 03:33.505
makes him a creature apart.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.967
On a different frequency, you know?

03:41.847 --> 03:44.599
So... for the book.

03:44.682 --> 03:46.559
When would you start?

03:46.643 --> 03:49.187
Well, that's up to Prairie.

03:49.271 --> 03:53.483
I would never rush this, but...
Prairie, here's the thing.

03:53.567 --> 03:59.197
The process can sometimes
help people to heal.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.533
Storytelling is cleansing.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.787
But I also want to make sure
you control the narrative.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.788
That you profit from it.

04:07.289 --> 04:08.123
Hmm.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.502
And did it heal them?

04:13.670 --> 04:15.130
All the money?

04:15.213 --> 04:19.968
It's given his family a security
that they've never known.

04:20.052 --> 04:24.264
But more importantly,
the process of telling this story

04:24.347 --> 04:27.434
has somehow exorcised it.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.311
Jamie will tell you.

04:29.394 --> 04:33.064
He says that when we typed, "The end..."

04:33.607 --> 04:35.692
that meant it was truly over.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.202
Sorry.

04:46.244 --> 04:49.122
- I don't think that--
- What's that, honey?

04:49.998 --> 04:51.083
I think this isn't gonna work.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.461
But I can...
We can do it however you--

04:54.544 --> 04:57.130
I can't give you
what Jamie gave you is the problem.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.216
It's not about you giving me any--

04:59.299 --> 05:00.968
His story has an end.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.512
-Well--
-I'm...

05:05.472 --> 05:07.140
This is just beginning.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.562
I'm very, very... I'm very sorry.

05:22.197 --> 05:24.699
<i>The first time</i>
<i>you fall asleep in prison...</i>

05:25.826 --> 05:26.952
<i>you forget.</i>

05:27.702 --> 05:29.204
You wake up a free woman.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.041
And then you remember that you're not.

05:35.543 --> 05:38.796
<i>You lose your freedom many times</i>
<i>before you finally believe it.</i>

06:27.595 --> 06:28.805
You have to eat.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.100
The pellets make me sick to my stomach.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.601
You'll acclimate.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.321
I'm gonna lose my mind down here.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.116
Is that part of this?

06:52.162 --> 06:53.038
No.

06:53.830 --> 06:54.873
Talk to the others.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.209
Keep your mind busy. I...

06:58.293 --> 07:00.879
I can get you braille books.
What do you like to read?

07:00.963 --> 07:04.341
I won't be able to live
without sunlight and air.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.843
-The others have.
-The others aren't blind.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.413
<i>Night slipped into day.</i>

07:38.959 --> 07:40.502
<i>Day into night.</i>

07:47.634 --> 07:49.386
Where is August?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.638
What have you done with her?

07:51.721 --> 07:54.099
I need to know that she's okay.

07:54.599 --> 07:55.683
She needs me.

07:55.767 --> 07:59.229
Enough, Rachel.
You know he's taken her upstairs.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.231
She needs me.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.280
<i>We were like the living dead.</i>

08:09.447 --> 08:12.575
<i>Right next to each other, but alone.</i>

08:15.662 --> 08:18.915
<i>There's nothing more isolating</i>
<i>than not being able to feel time.</i>

08:18.999 --> 08:20.375
Let me out!

08:20.458 --> 08:24.129
<i>To not feel the distance</i>
<i>between hours, days.</i>

08:34.097 --> 08:35.765
You're alive.

08:35.848 --> 08:37.434
You're alive. You're alive.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.189
You're gonna get out of here.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.203
Is anyone awake?

09:18.391 --> 09:20.268
Jesus.

09:20.352 --> 09:23.855
Did you just...
throw up in our fuckin' water?

09:25.315 --> 09:26.441
I need water.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.735
No drinking water right now.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.154
We're using it to wash up.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.771
Okay. Come on.

10:05.897 --> 10:07.190
Let's go.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.710
There's a door in front of you.
Push it.

10:38.680 --> 10:39.931
Hold on.

11:24.141 --> 11:25.643
Thank you.

11:28.145 --> 11:29.356
That's enough.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.101
Take the other half.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.028
You won't eat 'cause the others can't.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.155
Is that it?

14:27.950 --> 14:29.577
Make 'em all sandwiches.

14:30.578 --> 14:33.039
I don't care.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.260
Big step. Hold on.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.125
Here.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.641
You know, somebody might want
to show some gratitude.

15:33.725 --> 15:34.726
This is because of her.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.733
It won't be a regular occurrence.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.819
Why'd you have to fuck it up with mustard?

16:01.085 --> 16:02.044
Look, look.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.213
Hey, hey. Hey, you.

16:04.296 --> 16:07.509
You don't have to bang on the glass.
I can hear you.

16:07.592 --> 16:08.843
Come here. Come, come.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.344
Please.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.776
You got upstairs.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.987
I did.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.406
What's it like up there?

16:32.324 --> 16:33.910
The sun was out.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.247
You gotta get my ring.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.792
I stashed it up there
when he brought me in.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.044
It's in the bathroom.
You gotta bring it down for me.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.755
And a bill...
A bill for water, gas, anything.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.299
You gotta help me out, okay?
He trusts you.

16:48.382 --> 16:51.343
What... I don't...
What are you talking about?

16:52.094 --> 16:54.889
So, like, a year and 36 days ago,

16:54.972 --> 16:59.351
this guy says he'll give me 500 bucks
to participate in this study about NDEs.

16:59.435 --> 17:04.440
You see, Mandy, my son's mom...

17:04.524 --> 17:08.402
she told me she was pregnant.
Two months along. She just found out.

17:09.696 --> 17:12.406
I wanted to prove to her
that even though we weren't together,

17:12.489 --> 17:15.702
I would be a great dad.
I could support our son.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.954
I thought I'd do the study
and give her the 500 bucks

17:18.037 --> 17:19.455
as a symbol of that.

17:20.456 --> 17:21.958
So I get in the car with him.

17:22.041 --> 17:25.086
And he drives me here
and I asked to go to the bathroom.

17:26.253 --> 17:30.925
And I had this feeling, this...
this sinking feeling, uh...

17:33.886 --> 17:36.222
As soon as I got to the bathroom,

17:36.305 --> 17:39.141
I just stashed my championship
football ring in the medicine cabinet.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.351
I knew something was coming for me.

17:40.434 --> 17:43.646
I had to leave a trace,
in case I disappeared.

17:43.730 --> 17:44.856
Look.

17:46.733 --> 17:47.817
Look.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.859
Oh...

17:49.611 --> 17:50.945
Oh, shit.

17:51.028 --> 17:54.365
I... I forgot that, uh...

17:55.825 --> 17:56.909
Um...

17:58.703 --> 18:00.955
Well, I still have the money.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.289
Isn't that fucked up?

18:02.373 --> 18:05.334
Well, what are you gonna do
with your ring and a bill?

18:05.417 --> 18:07.503
You're gonna mail it.

18:07.587 --> 18:11.924
And you'll leave a note in it
saying to send it to Mandy.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.051
She could use it to get my son, uh,

18:14.135 --> 18:17.263
diapers, or clothes,
or little music tapes to make him smart.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.057
Are you kidding me?

18:21.183 --> 18:24.561
If I ever get up there again
I have to, like, find a phone

18:24.646 --> 18:25.980
or hit him over the head with some--

18:26.063 --> 18:28.775
This is more important than that,
all right? Please.

18:29.692 --> 18:33.988
We are down here.
There is nothing to do about that.

18:34.071 --> 18:38.242
But my son is out there every day
without a father.

18:40.202 --> 18:44.415
It kills me every day to think
he thinks I walked out on him.

18:47.418 --> 18:50.880
-How do you know it's a boy?
-What?

18:52.006 --> 18:54.008
What if you have a daughter?

18:54.091 --> 18:57.511
Are you listening to me?
I don't feel like you're listening to me.

18:57.595 --> 18:58.888
I'm listening. I...

18:59.764 --> 19:01.598
I just need a moment to think...

19:02.892 --> 19:04.894
about my own plan.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.689
Prairie, Prairie, Prairie, Prairie.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.213
Fuck! No, no, no.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.090
Cover your vent, Prairie.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.257
What's that smell?

19:35.341 --> 19:38.719
- Get on your bed. Stand on it. Now!
- No. It's not my turn!

19:38.803 --> 19:40.805
Feel the wall near the ceiling.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.849
The wall near the ceiling.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.810
To the right, way to the right.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.019
Way.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.730
More to the right!

19:49.814 --> 19:52.441
More. Keep going. There.

20:14.546 --> 20:17.091
Homer... what happened?

20:18.175 --> 20:19.385
<i>Homer?</i>

21:17.443 --> 21:19.445
A family was gonna live here.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.030
Probably not.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.615
They just built it
and then the economy went to shit.

21:24.575 --> 21:28.329
But if that hadn't happened,
some family would have had a life here.

21:29.413 --> 21:30.831
It's not really something you think about

21:30.915 --> 21:32.917
when you're looking for somewhere
to deal out of.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.087
Fighting in the kitchen, kids being born,

21:36.170 --> 21:39.756
heartache, sex, probably in this tub.

21:40.883 --> 21:42.468
Until they don't anymore.

21:43.552 --> 21:46.180
Kids movin' out. Parents getting sick.

21:46.263 --> 21:48.349
People getting old.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.060
You sound like one of the poetry kids.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.981
Poetry kids?

21:55.064 --> 21:59.693
You know, the ones who write poems
about, like, cutting themselves and shit.

22:08.536 --> 22:10.496
You said we were gonna help people.

22:12.123 --> 22:15.542
Did you mean, like,
Homer and Scott and Rachel?

22:19.296 --> 22:20.840
So this is dangerous?

22:29.098 --> 22:30.391
Families suck.

22:31.808 --> 22:32.935
Yeah.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.230
Not all of them, though.

22:37.398 --> 22:41.027
Not the ones you build
out of strange pieces.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.112
And they work.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.656
They don't look like they should,
but they do.

23:17.688 --> 23:20.316
Hey. Left my bag.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.318
Yo, I just passed OA running out.

23:23.027 --> 23:24.946
Uh, she looked upset, too.

23:25.029 --> 23:26.863
Hey, what'd you do to her?

23:26.948 --> 23:28.199
Nothing.

23:28.282 --> 23:30.952
Don't treat me like I'm some
fucking pedophile or something.

23:31.035 --> 23:32.119
Pedophiles are people who are into kids.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.581
You think
you're so fucking smart, don't you?

23:35.664 --> 23:38.292
You think you're the king of the world
and we're your dumb little servants?

23:38.375 --> 23:40.669
-What are you talking about?
-Hey, don't forget, I know you.

23:40.752 --> 23:44.340
And I know the shitty, smelly house
you crawled out of this morning.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.258
I'm this close to beating the shit
out of you.

23:46.342 --> 23:48.677
-Then go ahead, take a swing.
-I'm not 12 anymore.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.722
I beat the shit out of you then.
I can beat the shit out of you now.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.975
Right. 'Cause you never change.

23:54.058 --> 23:56.727
And that's why your parents
want to send you to that place.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.192
Bitch.

24:25.131 --> 24:26.423
Pussy!

25:03.877 --> 25:06.547
<i>Hey, again. Rod Spence.</i>
<i>Calling you about your brother's estate.</i>

25:06.630 --> 25:08.215
<i>- Could you please, uh--</i>

25:09.216 --> 25:11.427
<i>Rod Spence, uh, trying you again.</i>

25:11.510 --> 25:13.887
<i>Your, uh, brother's will.</i>
<i>Please call me back.</i>

25:16.140 --> 25:17.849
<i>Hey, Otter. Theo.</i>

25:18.850 --> 25:21.228
<i>Just throwing out a line</i>
<i>to see what comes back.</i>

25:27.401 --> 25:29.070
<i>Hey, Otter. Theo.</i>

25:30.321 --> 25:32.698
<i>Just throwing out a line</i>
<i>to see what comes back.</i>

25:37.745 --> 25:40.831
<i>- Hey, Otter. Theo.</i>

25:40.914 --> 25:43.167
<i>Just throwing out a line</i>
<i>to see what comes back.</i>

26:26.543 --> 26:27.753
Steven.

26:29.046 --> 26:31.131
Yeah, I'm on my way. Right now.

26:31.215 --> 26:32.383
Okay, good.

26:32.466 --> 26:33.884
I stuck my neck out for you

26:33.967 --> 26:36.011
with Principal Gilchrist and your parents.

27:16.092 --> 27:18.304
-You are?
-Uh, Winchell.

27:18.387 --> 27:19.971
Take the open seat.

27:20.055 --> 27:20.973
And?

27:21.515 --> 27:24.185
Hit the space bar.
It's pretty self-explanatory.

27:35.779 --> 27:38.574
<i>- Welcome to the Alternative School.</i>

27:38.657 --> 27:41.285
<i>You're here because you aren't</i>
<i>the typical student.</i>

27:41.368 --> 27:44.371
<i>Traditional environments</i>
<i>don't work for you, but that's okay.</i>

27:44.455 --> 27:47.999
<i>At the Alternative School,</i>
<i>you can pick your subjects each day</i>

27:48.083 --> 27:49.876
<i>and work at your own pace.</i>

27:49.960 --> 27:52.546
<i>Pretty neat. Shall we get started?</i>

27:59.261 --> 28:00.846
Can you see them better now,
you little bitch?

28:00.929 --> 28:01.805
I didn't do anything.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.933
Dude.

28:05.809 --> 28:07.811
How about now?
Can you see 'em better now?

28:07.894 --> 28:09.020
Just working on my geometry.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.064
There's no Euclid on my tits,
you fucking freak.

28:11.148 --> 28:12.357
That's my water.

28:20.907 --> 28:23.452
-That's an extra week.
-How long it takes your dick to get hard.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.388
What happened to you?

28:42.471 --> 28:43.680
Lacrosse.

29:03.325 --> 29:04.159
Steve.

29:06.036 --> 29:06.995
Come sit down.

29:11.417 --> 29:12.709
Is it okay?

29:33.730 --> 29:35.774
Here's something I can tell you.

29:37.401 --> 29:39.320
It's really hard to kill a man.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.948
It's even hard to allow a man to die.

29:59.256 --> 30:00.966
<i>I became his housekeeper.</i>

30:01.591 --> 30:03.677
<i>And slowly learned his ways.</i>

30:05.053 --> 30:09.016
<i>He trusted me because I was blind</i>
<i>and couldn't see his work.</i>

30:09.099 --> 30:10.892
<i>Which is all he ever did.</i>

30:23.655 --> 30:24.614
Are you sick?

30:25.616 --> 30:27.158
You can tell what I'm doing?

30:27.242 --> 30:28.702
No, I just...

30:28.785 --> 30:31.330
used to hear that sound
all the time as a kid.

30:33.123 --> 30:35.876
I don't like to sleep,
it's a waste of time, but...

30:35.959 --> 30:38.253
it's necessary, so...

30:38.337 --> 30:40.672
...sleeping pills.

30:43.759 --> 30:46.637
That's enough for tonight.
You can finish in the morning.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.108
<i>I knew what I had to do.</i>

31:00.734 --> 31:03.529
<i>I just had to figure out</i>
<i>how to do it under his nose.</i>

32:29.405 --> 32:31.575
<i>Hap got his food and supplies online.</i>

32:32.951 --> 32:34.453
<i>A delivery once a month.</i>

32:37.664 --> 32:40.208
<i>When I had crushed enough</i>
<i>sleeping pills...</i>

32:41.042 --> 32:42.836
<i>I asked him to order the ingredients</i>

32:42.919 --> 32:45.088
<i>for a stew my father had taught me</i>
<i>to make.</i>

33:04.525 --> 33:06.693
Why do Russians love beets so much?

33:09.905 --> 33:11.447
Beets survive frost.

33:12.365 --> 33:14.326
Hmm. Of course.

33:15.118 --> 33:16.703
Something always survives.

33:18.622 --> 33:23.418
When I was a boy,
there was a PBS program that I loved.

33:24.419 --> 33:27.798
Hosted by this...
this very proper British scientist.

33:28.840 --> 33:33.512
And he would go to, uh,
some impossible altitude or...

33:34.554 --> 33:36.223
some big desert somewhere.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.808
He was always whispering...

33:38.892 --> 33:42.103
"I'm standing here
in the remotest part of the world,

33:42.187 --> 33:43.730
where nothing should survive."

33:45.815 --> 33:49.736
There was always
some creature that was thriving.

33:50.403 --> 33:52.781
No matter how harsh the environment.

33:55.659 --> 33:59.538
I loved that show.
Gave me hope.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.874
It's almost done.
You said you had fresh parsley?

34:02.958 --> 34:06.127
Oh, I'm sure it's fine how it is.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.384
You're looking at me.

34:16.387 --> 34:17.472
Yes.

34:33.529 --> 34:36.324
Let me get you some parsley.
It's in the back garden.

34:36.407 --> 34:37.576
Just be a moment.

35:07.648 --> 35:10.358
Here... fresh parsley.

35:11.401 --> 35:12.944
Smells earthy.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.242
I'll eat when I'm done.

36:02.118 --> 36:04.705
"It's never gonna taste
as good as it does right now."

36:06.497 --> 36:08.416
My dad used to say that.

36:21.637 --> 36:23.389
Here. Why don't you...

36:24.474 --> 36:26.559
sit down?
You've worked so hard.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.124
Let's eat together.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.458
You should enjoy it, too.

36:59.259 --> 37:01.469
Are you okay? You're sweating.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.222
I... I've been over the stove.

37:10.020 --> 37:11.062
So?

37:11.146 --> 37:12.981
Give me a second.
What's the rush?

37:14.858 --> 37:17.778
I've never made someone
something from my childhood before.

37:28.788 --> 37:29.914
It's good.

37:33.584 --> 37:35.211
It's really nice.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.425
You're not eating.

37:48.850 --> 37:50.226
It's hard to eat.

37:51.519 --> 37:52.979
It reminds me of home.

38:13.249 --> 38:14.334
Are you choking?

38:15.376 --> 38:18.004
What's in the soup?
What did you put in the soup?

38:18.088 --> 38:19.422
Um, beets, onions,

38:19.505 --> 38:21.925
vegetable stock, sour cream.

38:22.008 --> 38:25.511
This vegetable stock has tomato paste.

38:26.930 --> 38:28.807
I can't eat tomatoes.

38:28.890 --> 38:30.100
It's okay.

38:30.183 --> 38:31.559
I have an EpiPen.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.706
Go and get my spare EpiPen.

38:54.624 --> 38:57.377
It's in the bathroom cabinet
above the sink.

39:01.547 --> 39:02.632
Don't be stupid.

39:02.715 --> 39:04.425
You don't know the door code.

39:04.509 --> 39:08.054
They're all trapped down there.
They'll... They'll starve and die.

39:08.137 --> 39:09.681
Go on.

39:56.477 --> 39:57.979
Forgive me.

39:58.063 --> 40:00.565
Forgive me, forgive me,
forgive me, forgive me.

40:29.052 --> 40:30.929
She died before you got here.

40:33.014 --> 40:34.765
Her name was August.

40:35.892 --> 40:37.310
Or that's what they called her.

40:38.686 --> 40:41.772
Because she... she came in August.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.111
Go clean up.

41:24.065 --> 41:25.150
What happened?

41:26.985 --> 41:29.028
He finally ass-fucked her.

41:29.112 --> 41:30.738
Shut the fuck up, Scott.

41:34.450 --> 41:35.368
What is it?

41:57.598 --> 42:00.060
He's burying August in the morning.

42:23.416 --> 42:25.043
He's outside! He's digging.

42:25.126 --> 42:27.587
Okay, let's go.
Who knows how long he'll be.

42:27.670 --> 42:30.131
Just like before
when I passed you the Ziploc,

42:30.215 --> 42:32.967
only we're against the current now,
so it's harder.

42:42.435 --> 42:45.230
A little more.

42:49.650 --> 42:51.444
I can't. It's pushing it back.

42:54.822 --> 42:57.658
All right. All right.

42:58.659 --> 43:02.163
Think of your shoulder like it's putty.
It can stretch.

43:02.246 --> 43:04.207
Just relax and then grow your arm.

43:15.551 --> 43:17.637
I've got it.

43:33.319 --> 43:34.612
Come on!

43:34.695 --> 43:36.156
We all wanna write something.
We don't have time.

43:41.286 --> 43:42.995
Who's it addressed to?

43:43.078 --> 43:44.122
Verizon.

43:44.205 --> 43:46.165
Those schmucks will think it's a prank.

43:46.249 --> 43:47.292
No. No, they won't.

43:47.375 --> 43:49.960
I used to work in a call center.
There's actual people there.

43:51.003 --> 43:53.256
I need to tell Mandy
I did not run out on the baby.

43:53.339 --> 43:55.466
- No, lunatic! We need to tell them...
- Shh.

43:55.550 --> 43:58.010
...to get the police.
That we're trapped here.

43:58.093 --> 44:00.054
Where? Where are we?

44:00.138 --> 44:02.640
I was out of it. I didn't see.

44:02.723 --> 44:04.559
- Out of it?
- I was high, Rachel.

44:04.642 --> 44:08.271
There was a two-lane highway,
lots of dust, rocks.

44:08.354 --> 44:11.316
Wait... is there a return address?

44:13.318 --> 44:15.653
A PO box. New York City.

44:15.736 --> 44:16.779
Is that traceable?

44:16.862 --> 44:17.863
- Maybe?
- I don't know.

44:17.947 --> 44:20.700
Well, we can't be more than
four hours from New York City.

44:20.783 --> 44:21.951
Maybe five by plane.

44:22.034 --> 44:24.870
-You got on a plane with him?
-You got in a car with him.

44:24.954 --> 44:27.832
Describe him. Medium build...

44:27.915 --> 44:29.542
Yeah, brown hair, brown eyes.

44:29.625 --> 44:30.668
I think they're blue.

44:30.751 --> 44:32.337
-Sharp nose.
-Not that sharp.

44:32.420 --> 44:34.839
-It's distinct.
-Say that he's a doctor,

44:34.922 --> 44:36.174
maybe an anesthesiologist.

44:36.257 --> 44:39.552
And that he has a single-engine plane,
so he has a pilot's license.

44:39.635 --> 44:41.554
That's good, that's good.
What do you got so far?

44:41.637 --> 44:42.638
Okay.

44:42.722 --> 44:44.182
"Four of us are being held captive.

44:44.265 --> 44:46.309
This PO box is picked up by the captor.

44:46.392 --> 44:48.894
We are held four to five hour flight
from New York City."

44:48.978 --> 44:50.896
Say that he had to refuel the plane twice.

44:50.980 --> 44:51.981
"Refuel..."

44:52.648 --> 44:55.109
Give them...
give them my brother's address.

44:55.192 --> 44:58.863
3512 Mapleton, Fort Wayne, Indiana.

44:58.946 --> 45:01.949
He gonna come pick you up?
He's in a wheelchair. We need the police.

45:02.032 --> 45:03.659
Fort Wayne. Prairie?

45:03.743 --> 45:05.578
Nancy and Abel Johnson.

45:06.203 --> 45:08.623
189 Mills Pond, Claude, Michigan.

45:08.706 --> 45:10.375
Michigan. A-B-E-L.

45:10.458 --> 45:12.710
-Who do you wanna put down, Scott?
-I don't wanna take up the space.

45:12.793 --> 45:15.046
-There's plenty of space.
-There's no one.

45:15.129 --> 45:16.922
Just tell 'em to call the FBI.

45:21.886 --> 45:23.971
It's perfect. Send it back.

45:39.236 --> 45:41.155
The current is strong.
Make sure you've got it.

45:53.834 --> 45:54.960
I feel the plastic.

45:55.711 --> 45:57.380
-Are you sure?
-Wait.

45:57.463 --> 45:58.673
Wait, I feel...

45:58.756 --> 45:59.840
I've got the corner.

45:59.924 --> 46:01.301
You got it?

46:01.384 --> 46:02.843
He's coming! He's coming.

46:02.927 --> 46:05.304
I got it, I got it. I got it.

46:06.514 --> 46:08.474
Wait. Wait, I lost it. I lost it.

46:08.558 --> 46:10.518
Catch it downstream!
Downstream! Scott, downstream!

46:10.601 --> 46:14.188
- To the right! To the right!
- Scott! Scott! Scott!

46:16.441 --> 46:19.444
Fuck!

46:35.418 --> 46:38.379
<i>It just... disappeared.</i>

46:40.255 --> 46:41.716
Those football rings are clunky.

46:41.799 --> 46:44.719
Um, wouldn't Hap have, like,
noticed it in the envelope anyway?

46:44.802 --> 46:46.053
Maybe.

46:47.555 --> 46:50.224
Well, you were gonna put it
in the middle of the mail pile, right?

46:50.307 --> 46:51.726
Hap wouldn't notice that.

46:51.809 --> 46:54.687
Oh, shut up, guys. Seriously.
You ask the dumbest questions.

46:55.771 --> 46:59.066
- Now, how did you get it back?
- We didn't.

46:59.149 --> 47:01.318
Wait, so you lost Homer's ring?

47:01.402 --> 47:02.486
Yeah.

47:03.153 --> 47:05.155
It's probably 8,000 feet underground.

47:08.534 --> 47:10.202
Jesse's right.

47:10.745 --> 47:12.329
I mean, it was kind of impossible.

47:12.913 --> 47:14.457
An impossible hope.

47:16.667 --> 47:18.085
And when it was gone...

47:19.253 --> 47:21.338
everything came crashing down with it.

47:34.059 --> 47:35.102
Stop.

47:35.978 --> 47:37.312
You have to stop.

47:44.904 --> 47:46.155
Stand up.

47:50.618 --> 47:52.453
I said, stand up.

47:54.038 --> 47:55.456
I can't.

47:57.500 --> 48:00.377
Stand up
and put your arms in the air.

48:04.006 --> 48:07.342
I don't... I don't...
I don't want to.

48:07.427 --> 48:09.386
Doesn't matter. Do it.

48:09.470 --> 48:10.971
Do it for me.

48:14.642 --> 48:15.893
Get up.

48:17.603 --> 48:19.480
Get up.

48:21.107 --> 48:22.191
I can't.

48:22.274 --> 48:24.401
Yes, you can. Up. Up.

48:27.655 --> 48:29.407
Jump.

48:29.865 --> 48:30.866
What?

48:30.950 --> 48:33.368
Stop talking. Start jumping.

48:33.453 --> 48:34.662
Jump.

48:34.745 --> 48:36.038
Again.

48:37.248 --> 48:39.041
Please, I can't.

48:39.124 --> 48:42.628
Oh, keep going.
Do it, Prairie. Jump.

48:44.672 --> 48:45.840
Again.

48:47.257 --> 48:50.470
Flap your arms as you jump.
Not silly, but for real.

48:50.553 --> 48:52.930
Like your arms are giant wings.

48:55.015 --> 48:56.016
Again.

48:57.226 --> 48:58.310
Higher.

48:59.228 --> 49:01.230
Again.

49:02.773 --> 49:03.941
Again.

49:06.026 --> 49:06.944
See?

49:11.824 --> 49:14.618
You've got it. You're okay.

49:14.702 --> 49:16.537
Don't fall in the water...

49:16.621 --> 49:18.748
...or knock over a plant.

49:20.124 --> 49:21.709
Am I doing jumping jacks?

49:21.792 --> 49:24.670
Yeah, you're...
you're sorta doing jumping jacks.

49:49.319 --> 49:50.362
Homer, I'm--

49:50.445 --> 49:51.822
Don't even say it.

50:05.460 --> 50:07.547
We tried to escape and we failed.

50:09.006 --> 50:10.507
But we did it together.

50:11.300 --> 50:13.427
We could do it again.

50:15.680 --> 50:17.389
We could get outta here.

50:20.351 --> 50:22.645
If I ever get out of here...

50:23.771 --> 50:25.773
I'd want to sing something...

50:27.650 --> 50:29.276
for my little brother.

50:32.196 --> 50:33.488
Keep going.

50:35.741 --> 50:38.035
I used to sing in church choir.

50:39.704 --> 50:41.163
I was pretty good.

50:42.915 --> 50:46.085
People tellin' me
I should make a go of it, so...

50:48.170 --> 50:52.382
I took my little brother
and we snuck off.

50:54.719 --> 50:58.055
It's not that we didn't love our family.
We did.

50:58.138 --> 51:00.307
But there was a lot of hate in that town.

51:01.976 --> 51:04.895
My father was like all of them.

51:08.148 --> 51:09.734
Stole the family van.

51:12.444 --> 51:14.196
Headed to Nashville.

51:16.490 --> 51:19.284
I thought I could raise my brother myself.

51:27.334 --> 51:29.629
But the van flipped on the highway.

51:31.797 --> 51:34.049
Collapsed all around us.

51:39.805 --> 51:44.393
But I... was floating above the car.

51:47.062 --> 51:51.233
And I could see my little brother's
red backpack in the middle of the road.

51:53.653 --> 51:55.487
You died and came back?

51:56.822 --> 52:00.993
Everyone here...
really died and came back.

52:02.578 --> 52:03.871
Yeah, my...

52:04.664 --> 52:07.875
my voice changed after that.

52:09.752 --> 52:11.378
Became something else.

52:14.632 --> 52:17.343
I don't know. He just...

52:19.679 --> 52:21.430
He never got to hear it.

52:25.517 --> 52:28.270
I just want a fucking cup of coffee...

52:29.772 --> 52:31.190
and a cigarette.

52:32.149 --> 52:34.068
Sit on a stoop in the sun...

52:36.528 --> 52:39.365
in the mornin' before the city gets loud.

52:43.202 --> 52:44.494
What about you, Homer?

52:45.287 --> 52:47.748
Take my son places I've never been.

52:50.125 --> 52:53.170
See things together for the first time.

52:53.671 --> 52:57.257
Like, uh, the pyramids,
or the Northern Lights.

53:00.094 --> 53:01.303
I'd swim.

53:02.512 --> 53:03.723
In a pool or a lake?

53:03.806 --> 53:05.808
I don't know, a lake maybe.

53:07.184 --> 53:09.520
It doesn't really
make a difference. I'm...

53:09.603 --> 53:11.271
not very good at it anymore.

53:13.232 --> 53:15.025
I just like the feeling
of being surrounded

53:15.109 --> 53:17.027
by something other than the dark.

53:20.489 --> 53:22.116
What's it sound like, Rachel?

53:23.033 --> 53:25.494
The song for your brother.

55:29.201 --> 55:30.077
Thanks.

55:34.081 --> 55:36.708
Oh... I needed that.

55:39.920 --> 55:41.463
Is your hair different?

55:43.173 --> 55:46.093
Hmm? Are you doing your hair differently?

55:50.139 --> 55:51.848
Well, it looks nice like that.

55:54.559 --> 55:56.770
All right, that's enough for today.

56:04.403 --> 56:06.071
What did you do to August?

56:06.780 --> 56:07.823
Hmm?

56:08.532 --> 56:10.409
What happens after the gas?

56:11.785 --> 56:13.245
Oh, that's my part of it.

56:14.079 --> 56:17.582
Don't you worry about it.
The gas is so you...

56:17.666 --> 56:19.167
You don't have to worry.

56:19.876 --> 56:22.963
Look, Prairie, all great work...

56:23.046 --> 56:25.340
important work, comes at great cost.

56:32.014 --> 56:33.682
Run, Prairie, run!

56:33.765 --> 56:35.767
Go! Prairie, go get help!
