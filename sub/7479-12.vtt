WEBVTT

00:37.972 --> 00:39.963
You are not of this world, my friend.

00:40.140 --> 00:41.664
"USN?"

00:42.810 --> 00:45.938
If I'm not mistaken,
which I often am,

00:46.113 --> 00:49.105
you've got a Naval signature.

00:49.283 --> 00:51.376
Well, that's just weird.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.110
Not weird at all.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.049
Toe-tag check.

00:55.456 --> 00:58.323
Not sure where they think
anyone's going.

01:00.527 --> 01:02.961
Mrs. Smith, present.

01:03.831 --> 01:09.736
Mr. Yusef Afzal is under the guidance
of the eminently qualified Rose Carlyle.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.393
Yeah, sorry. Edward?

01:11.639 --> 01:13.163
- Edgar.
- Edgar.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.069
Um, I have to call a friend...

01:15.276 --> 01:16.868
I mean, a colleague.

01:17.044 --> 01:20.275
Don't touch anything, okay?

01:20.481 --> 01:22.039
I can never get a signal in here.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.309
What would I touch?

01:24.485 --> 01:26.077
I love my job.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.653
My temporary unpaid internship

01:28.822 --> 01:32.724
that will hopefully lead
to a fully realized life.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.994
Uh, incoming are left up front.

03:34.081 --> 03:37.539
Do you think you're clever?

03:37.718 --> 03:39.015
That you can read people?

03:39.186 --> 03:41.814
That you know things?

03:43.557 --> 03:48.392
Well, I'm an undercover agent
for a highly respected federal agency,

03:49.997 --> 03:51.897
so I'm gonna go with yes.

03:52.699 --> 03:54.667
And I'm sorry about your syrup.

03:55.436 --> 03:58.269
What you so crassly refer to
as my syrup

03:58.439 --> 04:03.240
is my MichoacÃ¡n
shade-grown agave nectar.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.877
My personal sweetener.

04:05.045 --> 04:08.242
But, however,
it isn't that to which I refer.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.110
I've just, uh, received copies

04:10.317 --> 04:14.014
of your federal
360 coworker evaluations.

04:14.188 --> 04:20.127
Perfect scores in every category,
for every coworker?

04:20.360 --> 04:22.191
What can I say?
You run a tight ship.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.229
You know what you have to do
with these.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.061
Redo them.

04:28.235 --> 04:29.532
I'll race you for it.

04:31.638 --> 04:33.071
You think you can win?

04:34.641 --> 04:36.438
- Just because you're...
- I didn't say that.

04:36.643 --> 04:38.770
- Just because I'm...
- I didn't say that either.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.606
All right, let's do it.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.907
Come on, top of the wall.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.083
Top of the wall.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.781
I have to, uh, warn you

04:46.987 --> 04:51.583
that if you indulge in this sort
of frivolity and brinkmanship

04:51.758 --> 04:53.055
and I win,

04:53.594 --> 04:57.496
I'm going to expect these tomorrow.

04:57.664 --> 04:58.722
Deal.

05:01.068 --> 05:04.595
I also need to tell you
that I've had years of practice.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.466
You don't scare me.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.870
- Well, maybe a little bit.
- Ha, ha.

05:09.443 --> 05:14.380
I seem to recall a certain Sherpa
saying exactly that

05:14.581 --> 05:17.880
just before I beat him
to the Everest summit

05:18.819 --> 05:20.480
with a broken arm.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.120
You expect me to believe that?

05:23.824 --> 05:25.314
Okay, see, now you're bluffing.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.022
On three.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.492
One.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.964
Two.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.591
Wise choice.

05:35.802 --> 05:41.104
And, no, I won't do this just for fun.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.639
I wasn't gonna ask.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.505
Ask what?

05:45.679 --> 05:47.203
Wait a minute.

05:47.414 --> 05:49.712
- Was she bluffing?
- Who?

05:49.950 --> 05:52.180
She does this to me every time.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.819
She knows I think she's bluffing,

05:54.021 --> 05:55.852
then she starts
with these Yoda mind tricks.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.183
Did Callen sleep last night?

05:57.424 --> 06:02.123
So that I don't take the challenge,
which is what she wanted?

06:02.629 --> 06:04.221
You didn't have him
reading Hegel again?

06:04.698 --> 06:07.030
It wasn't me. I burned all my copies.

06:07.234 --> 06:08.326
Copies of what?

06:08.502 --> 06:11.300
- Whoa, what are you drinking?
- Coffee by the half gallon.

06:11.471 --> 06:14.872
I'm literally mainlining caffeine,
because it's much more "effish."

06:16.043 --> 06:18.511
That's an efficient way
of saying "efficient."

06:18.679 --> 06:22.046
So is this why I have to pull over
every 20 minutes for you to pee?

06:22.215 --> 06:23.580
It's a con.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.813
No, it's a double con,
that's what it is.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.182
That's exactly what it is.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.986
- Callen.
- Okay, what did I miss?

06:32.192 --> 06:33.352
Hey, Rose.

06:33.527 --> 06:36.496
I came back. I saw him and I ran.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.028
- Rose?
- Oh, here.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.530
- Rose, slow down.
- I... l... Yeah.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.067
The... And l...

06:46.840 --> 06:49.832
So I was trying to call you
but he wouldn't stop chatting.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.069
Oh, dear, I shouldn't say that
now that he's dead.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.076
And right here,
he didn't have far to go.

06:55.282 --> 06:56.408
We're done.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.347
So I was walking out
because reception in here is lousy,

06:59.553 --> 07:01.077
but I came back.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.882
I saw him and I ran.

07:04.291 --> 07:07.055
Rose, you need to listen to me.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.592
They had a plan. They had guns.
You did the right thing.

07:09.796 --> 07:13.391
Did I? Then why do I feel
so crummy?

07:13.600 --> 07:16.034
- Were you and Edgar close?
- No, not at all.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.465
That's the worst part.

07:17.638 --> 07:20.072
I barely knew him.

07:20.907 --> 07:23.102
Nate always knew what to say.

07:23.310 --> 07:26.370
Not that you guys don't,
but, you know.

07:26.546 --> 07:29.879
He's an operational psychologist.
That's what he does for a living.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.975
- I miss him.
- We all do.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.950
You said you were trying to call me?

07:35.155 --> 07:38.522
Yeah, yeah.
I found a residue on the body.

07:38.725 --> 07:41.660
You know, the one that was stolen,
and I recognized the Naval signature.

07:41.828 --> 07:42.954
USN.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.221
U.S. Navy.

07:44.398 --> 07:46.389
Nate and I talked about it once.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.033
Um, so when I saw it

07:48.235 --> 07:50.533
I thought,
do I know anyone in the Navy?

07:51.071 --> 07:52.561
I'll need to see a sample.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.604
Of course.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.636
The coroner's van is missing.
Eric's looking for it.

08:01.548 --> 08:02.776
These guys are good.

08:02.949 --> 08:05.782
Residue on a stolen body
with a Naval signature.

08:05.952 --> 08:07.180
Does that sound normal to you?

08:07.421 --> 08:09.286
No, it sounds classified to me.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.985
They waited for the guard
to make his rounds,

08:12.159 --> 08:13.751
jimmied the door down the hall,

08:13.927 --> 08:15.485
came right in,
walked out the same way.

08:15.662 --> 08:16.959
Okay, so that is there.

08:17.164 --> 08:20.429
We also have them on camera here,
here and here.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.091
It's a closed-circuit DVR deck,
but it's low-resolution.

08:23.670 --> 08:24.864
They're wearing caps

08:25.105 --> 08:27.266
and they're turned away
from the camera.

08:27.441 --> 08:29.534
Wow, bad guys, one.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.577
Cops, zero.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.076
Downloading.

08:38.118 --> 08:41.451
Funny, isn't it?
A thousand ways to die.

08:41.621 --> 08:44.385
Only two ways to go, though,
cremated or buried.

08:44.624 --> 08:47.320
Not me, I don't wanna be buried
and I don't wanna be burned.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.721
But you will have to choose.

08:48.895 --> 08:50.658
- Casket or urn?
- Nope.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.729
I'm going for cryogenic suspension.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.729
Frozen in a suspended state
of animation

08:54.901 --> 08:57.870
and then thawed out when they have
the technology to bring me back.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.402
Can we keep you in the office?

08:59.639 --> 09:02.540
With a little viewing window like
an aquarium. That would be so cool.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.337
You mock me, when I come back,
do you know what I'm gonna do?

09:05.512 --> 09:06.911
I'm gonna marry your daughter.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.582
- Oh, that is awkward.
- That is creepy.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.583
You know what I would love though,
is for you to be my mother-in-law.

09:12.753 --> 09:15.381
Think about that.
Oh, Mrs. Blye, it's so good to see you.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.648
What a wonderful one-piece jumpsuit
you're wearing.

09:17.824 --> 09:19.655
Would you stop?
You're giving me nightmares.

09:19.826 --> 09:23.125
Me helping you with your walker
to the early-bird special?

09:23.330 --> 09:24.991
Anything on the vic?

09:25.198 --> 09:26.392
Ask Eddie Haskell.

09:26.633 --> 09:30.125
I talked to L.A.P.D. And they're more
than happy to hand the case over.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.601
The report says
it's a home invasion gone bad.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.207
Yusef Afzal was killed
by blunt-force trauma to the head.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.768
He was hit, he fell and then died.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.003
- And then half autopsied.
- Then stolen.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.944
It's a bad day even for a dead guy.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.011
Eric found the van.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.950
Kensi, take Beaver here
and check it out, will you?

09:49.156 --> 09:51.215
Beaver? Really?

09:51.391 --> 09:53.256
Okay. No, that's fine.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.054
If we're gonna do a nickname
maybe we should do something cool.

09:56.229 --> 10:00.427
Like Diesel? Or, uh,
D-Rock or D-Unit?

10:00.934 --> 10:02.799
Just think about it.

10:02.969 --> 10:05.028
He needs decaf.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.201
That's not much of a plan.

10:09.376 --> 10:13.574
Steal a body, steal a van,
drive four blocks, abandon the van.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.442
I mean, this is completely
nonsensical.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.981
It seems to have worked for them.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.111
Looks like one of your parking jobs,
Deeks.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.486
One of the reasons I became a cop.
You can park anywhere you want.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.086
Seriously, why did you
become a cop?

10:28.962 --> 10:30.259
You mean, like, honestly?

10:30.463 --> 10:31.623
No, lie to me.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.299
I wanted to protect people.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.299
I wanted to do something that
made a difference in people's lives.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.095
That's really nice, Deeks.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.967
That, and I know how girls
love guys in uniforms.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.470
- Overrated.
- Really?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.269
Overrated, the whole uniform thing?

10:44.811 --> 10:48.303
You don't like that shiny badge?
Those tight polyester pants?

10:48.515 --> 10:50.107
Door, Deeks.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.410
One, two, three.

10:53.587 --> 10:54.747
Bomb.

11:05.239 --> 11:07.537
Maybe they did have a plan.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.142
What do we know
about our stolen dead guy?

11:22.347 --> 11:24.372
Yusef Afzal, 36 years old,

11:24.550 --> 11:27.075
worked at Cal West Hospital
as a computer tech.

11:27.252 --> 11:30.585
No criminal record, nothing on Interpol,
no watch list, nothing.

11:30.823 --> 11:33.053
He was born here,
he never left the country.

11:33.258 --> 11:34.987
He's, like, the most boring guy
in Venice.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.752
And our body snatchers?

11:38.163 --> 11:39.528
The bomb did an excellent job

11:39.698 --> 11:41.666
of destroying any trace
of what they were doing.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.892
No visuals, no prints, no DNA,

11:44.069 --> 11:46.060
and we're still tracking down
that Navy signature

11:46.238 --> 11:47.466
that was found on Yusef.

11:47.673 --> 11:49.971
So why do you steal a dead body?

11:50.175 --> 11:51.267
Proof of death.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.478
- Satanic ritual.
- Cannibalism.

11:56.482 --> 11:59.542
- Just thinking outside the box.
- You need to get back in the box.

11:59.718 --> 12:01.379
But why this one? Why this corpse?

12:01.553 --> 12:03.885
Why risk a murder conviction
to steal it?

12:04.356 --> 12:07.348
Maybe he's not Yusef Afzal.
It could be a cover.

12:07.559 --> 12:08.890
We could run Yusef'ss DNA,

12:09.061 --> 12:10.756
see if he's in
the SOCOM database.

12:10.996 --> 12:12.054
It's a long shot.

12:13.098 --> 12:16.090
I mean, if he's any kind of a jihadist,
he'd be keeping a low profile.

12:16.301 --> 12:18.235
Either he was a sleeper
way below the radar

12:18.403 --> 12:20.803
or Yusef has more secrets
than we realize.

12:21.039 --> 12:22.904
All right,
according to L.A.P.D. Crime report,

12:23.075 --> 12:25.407
neighbors heard yelling,
came over, knocked on the door,

12:25.577 --> 12:28.273
called the alarm company
and 911 from the stoop.

12:28.447 --> 12:30.438
Quite a neighborhood watch.

12:30.616 --> 12:33.210
Report also says
the perps escaped out the back.

12:33.385 --> 12:35.819
Case is cold from there.

12:40.125 --> 12:41.524
Oh, can I help you?

12:42.294 --> 12:44.956
Can we help you carry Yusef'ss stuff
to your car

12:45.130 --> 12:47.598
because we're sort of wondering
who you are?

12:48.100 --> 12:49.624
And I'm wondering who you are.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.803
We are investigating
Yusef'ss murder.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.567
Your turn.

12:57.342 --> 12:59.469
Larissa Bay, his girlfriend.

13:00.546 --> 13:02.605
I was just grabbing
a few things of ours.

13:02.814 --> 13:04.304
You know, memories.

13:04.483 --> 13:06.417
If you need it for evidence, take it.

13:06.585 --> 13:07.813
It's okay.

13:07.986 --> 13:11.149
Maybe you can tell us a little bit
about Yusef.

13:11.323 --> 13:12.984
Where did you guys meet?

13:13.859 --> 13:15.087
At the hospital.

13:15.260 --> 13:17.785
I'm the charge nurse
on the pediatric floor.

13:17.996 --> 13:19.258
He was our computer tech.

13:19.431 --> 13:23.197
I think he crashed my server
a few times just to come by.

13:23.368 --> 13:25.302
The old workplace romance trick.

13:26.205 --> 13:27.832
Sounds like you two were serious.

13:28.073 --> 13:30.701
I think we both thought
it was going to be.

13:31.376 --> 13:34.937
We were friends for years
and started dating on Valentine's Day.

13:36.348 --> 13:39.317
The police are calling this
a home invasion.

13:40.018 --> 13:43.510
Which is hard to believe. It's
ridiculously safe. People everywhere.

13:43.689 --> 13:45.884
Can you tell me about
Yusef'ss background?

13:46.091 --> 13:48.218
Where was he from?
Was he religious?

13:48.393 --> 13:50.953
His parents fled Beirut in the '70s.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.562
They were Muslim
but not observant.

13:52.731 --> 13:55.859
So is that how he came
to have a non-observant girlfriend?

13:56.034 --> 13:58.901
I celebrate Christmas with my dad
and seder with my mom,

13:59.104 --> 14:01.334
and Yusef happily came to both.

14:01.506 --> 14:04.839
Any chance that's not his real name,
not his real background?

14:05.010 --> 14:07.535
Yusef is not a closet radical
or a militant,

14:07.746 --> 14:09.236
if that's what you're thinking.

14:09.481 --> 14:10.914
What he is, is completely American.

14:11.116 --> 14:14.381
I'm just saying that people have
an ability to hide a side of themselves.

14:14.553 --> 14:16.851
Does your partner hide
anything from you?

14:17.022 --> 14:19.320
As a matter of fact, she does, yeah.

14:19.524 --> 14:22.652
She's got a junk-food jones
she doesn't think I know about.

14:22.828 --> 14:26.855
But I find the Twinkie wrappers
stuffed between the car seats.

14:27.065 --> 14:29.397
That was one time on a stakeout.

14:29.635 --> 14:31.955
If that was one time
there's like 12 in a box, so that's...

14:32.137 --> 14:35.766
The police report says that you were
working the night of Yusef'ss death.

14:36.908 --> 14:38.398
Think I had something to do with it?

14:38.644 --> 14:41.613
Given the rocky family dynamic,
you've got different religions,

14:41.780 --> 14:43.941
- I think we're just saying...
- You're not hearing me.

14:45.517 --> 14:47.007
I loved Yusef.

14:48.587 --> 14:49.849
After his shift,

14:50.022 --> 14:54.288
he'd suit up and go into the NICU
with me to rock the babies.

14:54.526 --> 14:56.153
You have this all wrong.

14:57.863 --> 14:59.091
Evidently.

15:00.565 --> 15:02.795
You know, if he went into the NICU
he can't be all bad.

15:02.968 --> 15:06.597
- So you believe her?
- I really wish somebody was lying.

15:06.772 --> 15:07.796
Come on.

15:07.973 --> 15:10.168
- Let me go buy you a Ding Dong.
- Yummy.

15:12.077 --> 15:15.911
This is the residue
Rose got off Yusef'ss body, blown up.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.309
See the geometric shapes?

15:17.783 --> 15:19.080
It's a crystalline structure.

15:19.284 --> 15:21.411
See the eensy-weensy little numbers?

15:21.620 --> 15:24.214
That's a classified
Navy project identifier.

15:24.389 --> 15:25.879
It took some digging.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.616
If you make a number that small,
you're hiding something.

15:28.827 --> 15:30.055
It's called Overwatch.

15:30.228 --> 15:34.631
It's an experimental
special-ops tracking system.

15:35.267 --> 15:37.792
- And?
- And that's it.

15:37.969 --> 15:39.994
One-line description
and then nothing,

15:40.205 --> 15:44.107
nada, niente in the system
on who, what, when anything.

15:44.309 --> 15:47.335
They won't even talk about it over
the phone. Insisted we do it in person.

15:47.579 --> 15:48.603
Overwatch.

15:48.814 --> 15:51.305
I know, it's very Sauron.

15:52.651 --> 15:55.916
That's Lord of the Rings humor.

15:56.088 --> 15:57.146
Sorry.

16:04.529 --> 16:06.520
Overwatch
is a tagging detection system

16:06.732 --> 16:08.927
for use
in counter-insurgency operations.

16:09.101 --> 16:11.467
Sensor platforms can track insurgents
as they retreat

16:11.636 --> 16:13.866
or attempt to hide
among the civilian population.

16:14.039 --> 16:17.475
How about you tell us
what's not in the catalog description.

16:17.642 --> 16:20.440
Well, I can't get into specifics
even with you people.

16:20.612 --> 16:23.672
But the idea essentially
is that you tag a guy with the residue,

16:23.849 --> 16:26.443
you can track him anywhere
on the planet by satellite

16:26.618 --> 16:28.279
to within a yard away.

16:28.453 --> 16:29.613
That's impressive.

16:29.821 --> 16:31.482
You have no idea.

16:31.990 --> 16:34.117
Special Ops started field-testing
last month

16:34.292 --> 16:36.624
in a single high-conflict war zone.

16:36.795 --> 16:38.888
Here's our first go.

16:39.865 --> 16:42.527
- Kunduz.
- Afghanistan.

16:42.701 --> 16:45.499
And here are the targets.

16:46.304 --> 16:49.796
And here is the tracking history.

16:50.008 --> 16:52.374
- How long does the residue last?
- Few months, few days.

16:52.544 --> 16:54.205
We give the residue
the half-life we want.

16:54.413 --> 16:55.778
And it stays on.

16:55.981 --> 16:58.006
Clothes or skin. Let me show you.

16:58.216 --> 17:02.516
You need, uh, steel wool
or harsh chemicals to take it off,

17:02.721 --> 17:05.383
and that's assuming
you know you've been tagged.

17:05.557 --> 17:08.651
This is inactive spray
but it'll give you the idea.

17:11.061 --> 17:13.723
Here, see for yourself.

17:19.003 --> 17:22.064
- Have there been any problems?
- Tracking is spotty indoors.

17:22.240 --> 17:25.038
And, uh, we had one incident
involving a violent altercation

17:25.210 --> 17:28.771
where the residue actually
transferred subjects, but just once.

17:28.947 --> 17:30.847
The real issue is overload.

17:31.016 --> 17:33.883
Just the man-hours needed
to analyze the data dump.

17:34.085 --> 17:36.451
So many suspects
doing so many questionable things.

17:36.621 --> 17:40.580
Exactly. I gotta tell you
this is a game changer.

17:40.826 --> 17:43.192
But it's only as good
as your human intel.

17:43.829 --> 17:46.457
You have a target walk into
a radical mosque, what do you know?

17:46.698 --> 17:48.290
He could be using the bathroom

17:48.467 --> 17:50.526
or hawking a new cell-phone plan
to the imam.

17:50.702 --> 17:52.727
Thanks to various concerns
of a similar nature,

17:52.904 --> 17:54.098
we're limited to Kunduz.

17:54.339 --> 17:56.637
The geographic region
is reasonably sized,

17:56.842 --> 17:59.868
but there are lots of people to track
while we work out the bugs.

18:00.078 --> 18:02.273
Mind telling me how it ended up
on Yusef Afzal?

18:02.447 --> 18:05.416
Who, as far as we can ascertain,
has never been to Afghanistan.

18:09.754 --> 18:12.723
Yusef Afzal, he's not one of ours.

18:12.924 --> 18:15.654
- We didn't put it on him.
- So who did?

18:15.861 --> 18:17.920
Access is highly restricted.

18:18.096 --> 18:20.087
The residue
isn't even stored stateside.

18:20.298 --> 18:22.129
Bottom line, I have no idea.

18:22.868 --> 18:24.563
Commander, can you bring up L. A?

18:24.769 --> 18:26.737
As I said,
there are no subjects stateside.

18:27.439 --> 18:28.997
Humor me.

18:33.111 --> 18:35.671
We don't use this domestically.

18:37.115 --> 18:39.106
I don't understand.

18:39.784 --> 18:42.412
Okay, this... It's gotta be a glitch.

18:42.621 --> 18:43.918
Some glitch.

18:44.089 --> 18:47.149
Because it looks like someone is
illegally tracking dozens of Americans.

18:47.692 --> 18:51.788
Or there's dozens of Afghan terrorists
roaming around L.A.

19:03.140 --> 19:05.973
Okay, got it.

19:08.646 --> 19:09.704
It's not a glitch.

19:10.314 --> 19:11.781
No, it's not a glitch.

19:11.982 --> 19:13.813
The Pentagon
just went on high alert.

19:15.453 --> 19:17.648
Software says
it started about three weeks ago.

19:18.122 --> 19:20.022
A hundred and twelve subjects
have been tagged.

19:20.224 --> 19:21.748
Who? Why is the Navy
tracking them?

19:21.959 --> 19:22.983
It's not us.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.025
Our satellites
are picking up the residue.

19:25.262 --> 19:28.993
The Overwatch software is recording
and time-stamping it.

19:29.166 --> 19:30.997
But the rest of the data
has been encrypted.

19:31.168 --> 19:32.760
We cannot read anything.

19:32.970 --> 19:36.098
So somebody hijacked the world's
most powerful tracking technology.

19:37.875 --> 19:39.934
Basically, yes.

19:42.847 --> 19:45.441
We haven't had any luck
breaking the encryption.

19:45.616 --> 19:47.049
He's spoofing his IP address.

19:47.251 --> 19:50.778
Masking his real IP with a fake one.
This guy's good.

19:51.255 --> 19:54.452
He also hacked the tasking of satellites
to collect over L.A.

19:54.992 --> 19:56.016
Very good.

19:56.527 --> 20:00.019
All right, so why tag a hundred people
in Los Angeles?

20:00.264 --> 20:01.697
And what's the connection
to Yusef?

20:01.866 --> 20:03.026
What about the targets?

20:03.200 --> 20:05.464
Can we follow people home,
check their work addresses,

20:05.669 --> 20:06.897
cross-check them that way?

20:07.071 --> 20:09.699
The encryption makes the computer
think they're the same person.

20:09.874 --> 20:12.900
So we just see these icons
pop up willy-nilly.

20:13.077 --> 20:15.045
But we did find a common vector.

20:15.212 --> 20:17.339
Masjid Farook.
It's a mosque in Westchester.

20:17.548 --> 20:22.281
On any given day at afternoon prayer,
you can get ten, 20, 50 targets.

20:22.486 --> 20:24.181
So the hacker targeted
this mosque.

20:24.355 --> 20:28.018
Masjid Farook is not known
to be a radical hot spot.

20:28.225 --> 20:29.487
The imam likes publicity

20:29.660 --> 20:31.423
and there's the occasional
fringe speaker,

20:31.595 --> 20:33.722
but it's not considered
a security risk.

20:33.931 --> 20:35.421
Well, what about its members?

20:35.599 --> 20:36.759
Anybody on the watch list?

20:36.934 --> 20:38.526
No one to set your heart racing.

20:38.702 --> 20:40.033
I doubt whoever's behind this

20:40.204 --> 20:42.172
is gonna get caught
outside the mosque in a van

20:42.339 --> 20:44.102
with a pair of binoculars
and adult diapers.

20:44.308 --> 20:47.004
But it wouldn't hurt to have
our own surveillance to cross-check.

20:47.511 --> 20:49.775
Eric, send the details to Kensi.

20:49.947 --> 20:51.676
Nell, it's a nice visual.

20:54.919 --> 20:56.284
I had another thought.

20:56.454 --> 20:58.752
It's a little out there.

20:59.323 --> 21:02.053
Okay, so this guy spoofed
his IP address.

21:02.226 --> 21:03.250
Yeah.

21:03.427 --> 21:06.225
Now, he probably visits other sites
from the same computer.

21:06.397 --> 21:10.197
Maybe sometimes he forgets
and visits, I don't know, ESPN

21:10.367 --> 21:12.198
and is spoofing his IP address...

21:12.369 --> 21:15.395
And sometimes he visits
and he isn't spoofing.

21:15.606 --> 21:17.597
Leaving the real IP address behind.

21:18.242 --> 21:20.972
Now, that is very, very good.

21:25.850 --> 21:28.842
Tall guy, 10 o'clock.

21:32.723 --> 21:35.851
Kaffiyeh approaching our 9.

21:38.362 --> 21:40.660
What do we think
we're watching here?

21:40.865 --> 21:43.095
Feels like random people
going to a random mosque,

21:43.267 --> 21:44.757
not a hotbed for terrorist activity.

21:44.935 --> 21:47.426
If somebody's tracking them
they probably have a reason.

21:47.638 --> 21:49.128
Larissa said that Yusef came here.

21:49.306 --> 21:52.833
Well, when he wasn't at shabbas
and Christmas dinner.

21:53.010 --> 21:54.307
Look what happened to him.

21:54.512 --> 21:56.912
Well, I think it's nice
that he can move between worlds.

21:57.114 --> 21:59.309
How about moving
between the worlds of murder,

21:59.483 --> 22:01.474
abduction
and covert tracking systems?

22:01.685 --> 22:03.312
Is that nice?

22:04.622 --> 22:07.113
Happy family, 8 o'clock.

22:07.324 --> 22:10.088
Do you think they should know
what's happening?

22:10.261 --> 22:12.092
That some hacker
is targeting them?

22:12.296 --> 22:14.321
I mean,
we already have one dead body.

22:14.532 --> 22:15.863
Yeah, they have the right to know

22:16.033 --> 22:18.160
that some creep is tracking them
to the bathroom,

22:18.402 --> 22:20.165
the corner bar, to their girlfriend's.

22:20.337 --> 22:23.704
How about invading their privacy
and compromising their safety?

22:23.941 --> 22:26.603
Then again, who knows what the
imam would do with the information?

22:26.777 --> 22:29.439
He could denounce the situation,
put it on YouTube,

22:29.613 --> 22:31.808
send it to every tinderbox
in the Middle East.

22:32.016 --> 22:33.677
Oh, here we go.

22:34.485 --> 22:36.817
High-speed target,

22:36.987 --> 22:39.148
old lady with a walker, 9 o'clock.

22:39.323 --> 22:42.315
Yeah, she's trouble. Ha, ha.

22:46.830 --> 22:48.798
- Deeks, did you see that?
- See what?

22:49.633 --> 22:52.363
The guy with the tan jacket
just sprayed something on someone.

22:52.536 --> 22:54.527
What? Let me see.

22:58.075 --> 23:00.669
- That's our guy.
- Let's go.

23:02.513 --> 23:04.481
Too late, Kensi, follow that cab.

23:07.351 --> 23:09.046
Go, go, go.

23:09.219 --> 23:12.188
So by cross-checking exact page views
with the time of day,

23:12.389 --> 23:14.357
politics in the morning,
cricket at night,

23:14.558 --> 23:18.016
and because people are painfully
predictable in their Internet browsing,

23:18.195 --> 23:24.725
I matched this spoofed IP address
and this IP address.

23:24.902 --> 23:28.497
Which is Brentstein & Associates.

23:28.706 --> 23:31.607
A small firm
specializing in risk analysis.

23:33.410 --> 23:34.570
We did it.

23:42.686 --> 23:44.449
It would take a warrant
and a day and a half

23:44.622 --> 23:45.850
to identify which computer.

23:46.056 --> 23:49.685
And by then he'd have wiped
his hard drive and be long gone.

23:55.299 --> 23:57.028
Empty office.

23:57.234 --> 23:58.997
Could access their employee list.

23:59.903 --> 24:01.803
Interference?

24:12.316 --> 24:13.374
We've got company.

24:13.584 --> 24:14.744
One more minute.

24:14.952 --> 24:16.283
Uh, excuse me.

24:16.453 --> 24:17.647
Could you help me out here?

24:17.888 --> 24:19.014
Depends on what you need.

24:19.223 --> 24:20.383
Ha, ha. You're funny.

24:20.591 --> 24:22.650
Uh, I'm looking for Alan,
he's an accountant.

24:22.826 --> 24:25.090
I've decided
I need a numbers guy in my life.

24:25.262 --> 24:26.729
Am I on the right floor?

24:26.897 --> 24:28.797
There's no Alan here
and we're not accountants.

24:28.966 --> 24:31.059
I suggest you try the directory
in the lobby.

24:31.235 --> 24:33.169
Wait. You know what?

24:33.337 --> 24:37.296
Maybe it wasn't Alan. Adam, Alex?

24:37.474 --> 24:38.907
- You getting this, Eric?
- Got it.

24:39.076 --> 24:40.805
Running a broad spectrum search.

24:40.978 --> 24:44.311
- Uh, Assan?
- Nope.

24:47.918 --> 24:50.512
- Great. Well, thank you.
- Okay.

24:50.688 --> 24:52.986
Oh, sorry, sorry. One more thing.

24:53.157 --> 24:54.784
- Yeah.
- Do you have a restroom?

24:54.958 --> 24:57.483
I have this condition.

24:59.963 --> 25:01.931
Thank you.

25:02.099 --> 25:03.999
You better have a plan, G.

25:04.201 --> 25:06.135
Hey, Eric?
I think I got something.

25:06.336 --> 25:08.600
Hector Cage, former
Department of Homeland Security.

25:08.772 --> 25:11.332
Worked on a bunch of boring stuff,
boring stuff,

25:11.508 --> 25:14.636
and the early development team
of USN6457.

25:14.845 --> 25:17.177
That's the code name
for Overwatch.

25:17.681 --> 25:19.774
I'm waiting, Eric.

25:29.393 --> 25:31.020
This is your plan?

25:31.195 --> 25:33.129
I let you take lead
and ride shotgun for this?

25:33.297 --> 25:35.288
Xeroxing blank pieces of paper?

25:35.466 --> 25:38.833
People only see
what they wanna see.

25:40.337 --> 25:41.668
Dumb Luck Club.

25:41.839 --> 25:43.397
Callen, Sam, we've got something.

25:43.640 --> 25:47.303
Hector Cage, he's an analyst.
I'm sending you his photo now.

25:50.614 --> 25:51.808
See?

25:51.982 --> 25:53.677
Good plan.

25:53.851 --> 25:55.011
Dumb luck.

25:55.519 --> 25:56.543
Where's Hector's office?

26:06.530 --> 26:09.658
Hector Cage?
We'd like to ask you some questions.

26:17.174 --> 26:18.835
- Whoa, what are...?
- We found the guy.

26:19.009 --> 26:21.534
Huh. So did we.

26:21.745 --> 26:24.043
You ought to be more careful,
Hector.

26:39.095 --> 26:41.086
Three years Homeland Security
Computer Department.

26:41.263 --> 26:42.753
- I need a doctor.
- You saw a doctor.

26:42.932 --> 26:43.956
I saw an EMT.

26:44.133 --> 26:46.067
You're fine.
You got a clean bill of health.

26:46.235 --> 26:47.429
You can answer questions.

26:47.603 --> 26:49.628
Early development team,
Overwatch.

26:49.805 --> 26:51.067
According to your former boss,

26:51.240 --> 26:53.765
you had access
to the prototype of the residue.

26:53.943 --> 26:56.343
Then you moved on to Brentstein
& Associates where you do...

26:56.512 --> 26:59.242
Stochastic analysis of terrorist risk.
Which means l...

26:59.448 --> 27:02.747
Predict the chances
of a random terrorist attack.

27:02.918 --> 27:04.681
Insurance companies love you guys.

27:06.088 --> 27:08.147
Buildings are targets.
Buildings need insurance.

27:08.324 --> 27:09.951
Who should be paying
for all that risk?

27:10.126 --> 27:14.426
Let's get back to where you
hacked into classified military software.

27:14.630 --> 27:17.030
One of the guys you tagged
turned up dead.

27:24.173 --> 27:26.164
Nice mosque.

27:26.409 --> 27:29.845
Ha, ha. And his ID badge says
he works at a hospital.

27:30.046 --> 27:31.479
That is a grade-A soft target.

27:31.647 --> 27:34.616
Do you guys care at all if he espouses
the destruction of America?

27:34.817 --> 27:37.615
If we want your opinion, Hector,
we'll visit your blog.

27:37.787 --> 27:40.221
Right now, let's focus on
where you were two nights ago.

27:40.456 --> 27:42.048
I was at work, pulling an all-nighter.

27:42.224 --> 27:45.921
That can be verified by multiple
surveillance cameras and people.

27:46.662 --> 27:49.222
Anything else or?

27:49.465 --> 27:51.490
That's a nice spray bottle.

27:58.808 --> 28:00.503
Do you do that one at a time?

28:01.077 --> 28:02.806
It's a pretty time-consuming hobby.

28:04.814 --> 28:09.478
You are dangerously underestimating
the terrorist threat level.

28:10.019 --> 28:11.850
Privacy is history.

28:12.021 --> 28:14.080
International flights, gone.
Five years, max.

28:14.323 --> 28:16.188
We are all gonna be tagged
and monitored,

28:16.392 --> 28:18.883
every inch of every border is gonna
have a guy with a gun.

28:19.061 --> 28:21.586
What a hopeful vision for the future.

28:21.764 --> 28:24.358
Isn't stochastic analysis
about random threats?

28:24.533 --> 28:25.557
Yes.

28:25.734 --> 28:28.168
How do you predict something
that's random?

28:28.504 --> 28:30.938
I think your job is making you crazy,
Hector.

28:31.107 --> 28:32.165
Crazier.

28:32.374 --> 28:33.773
What are your employees gonna say

28:33.976 --> 28:37.343
when we tell them you've been
breaching national security?

28:41.050 --> 28:43.041
You haven't broken the encryption.

28:44.086 --> 28:45.553
Why do you say that?

28:45.754 --> 28:48.245
You wouldn't be talking to me
if you did.

28:49.125 --> 28:50.922
Just looking at
the data points here, guys.

28:51.093 --> 28:53.857
You have a dead body and you'd love
to know where he's been.

28:56.298 --> 28:59.028
I guess this is the part
where you make a deal with me

28:59.201 --> 29:00.634
for the encryption code?

29:06.642 --> 29:09.406
The encryption codes you got
from Hector Cage are working.

29:09.578 --> 29:11.512
Eric, we need everything you've got
on Yusef.

29:11.714 --> 29:14.581
- All right, I'm pulling it up now.
- Hector's alibi checks out.

29:14.750 --> 29:17.082
The desktop cam
matches the security cam,

29:17.253 --> 29:18.880
which matches
the coworkers' statements,

29:19.054 --> 29:21.818
and the footage is stored off-site.

29:22.024 --> 29:23.457
These guys are seriously paranoid.

29:27.396 --> 29:29.296
Dead men don't walk.

29:29.465 --> 29:31.092
Not unless it's Halloween.

29:31.300 --> 29:34.292
Maybe someone should tell
Yusef Afzal it's not Halloween.

29:34.537 --> 29:36.937
Where does he think he's going?

29:37.139 --> 29:39.164
Cal West Hospital.
What, is he going back to work?

29:39.408 --> 29:40.432
What's going on, Eric?

29:40.609 --> 29:41.803
According to Overwatch,

29:41.977 --> 29:45.174
Yusef Afzal just entered the
south entrance of Cal West Hospital.

29:45.347 --> 29:47.645
Maybe the residue
transferred subjects?

29:47.816 --> 29:49.147
Maybe to his girlfriend?

29:49.351 --> 29:51.319
Or to the killer. Violent altercation?

29:51.487 --> 29:53.614
Maybe they're the same person.

29:54.089 --> 29:55.681
Eric, find Larissa Bay.

30:03.566 --> 30:05.329
Larissa Bay
is scheduled to work today

30:05.501 --> 30:07.628
in the pediatric wing of the tower.

30:07.803 --> 30:10.169
- Kensi, Deeks, take Pediatrics.
- Talk to us, Eric.

30:10.339 --> 30:12.705
Looks like the target is headed
for the north wing.

30:12.942 --> 30:15.570
I can't tell which floor,
looks like the third.

30:15.778 --> 30:16.972
No, no, the fourth.

30:17.179 --> 30:19.773
Tracking is kind of spotty indoors.

30:24.220 --> 30:26.780
Deeks, Larissa just logged
into her station

30:26.989 --> 30:28.149
on the pediatric floor.

30:28.357 --> 30:31.087
ID and fingerprints are a match.

30:31.393 --> 30:32.951
Ready?

30:34.096 --> 30:36.394
Larissa, put your hands
where we can see them.

30:36.632 --> 30:38.463
- What?
- Guys, we got her.

30:38.667 --> 30:42.034
Wait, the target is still in
the north wing, that's two wings away.

30:42.238 --> 30:45.901
- The target is not Larissa.
- What's going on? What is this?

30:46.108 --> 30:48.474
- You're not the one we're looking for.
- No kidding.

30:48.644 --> 30:49.668
I'm sorry.

30:49.878 --> 30:51.971
Eric, target status. Where is he?

30:52.181 --> 30:53.671
The target is in the north wing.

30:53.849 --> 30:57.182
Okay, I got you.
Callen, Sam, you are almost there.

30:57.353 --> 30:59.753
Um, it looks like the target
is slowing down.

30:59.989 --> 31:03.720
Room 420. Room 422.

31:03.892 --> 31:06.827
Okay, he's stopping.
At the end of this corridor take a right.

31:07.029 --> 31:08.496
North wing is Radiology.

31:08.664 --> 31:11.394
Yusef spent the last two weeks there
doing a software overhaul.

31:11.867 --> 31:12.993
Now what, Eric?

31:13.168 --> 31:15.068
Go down this hallway,
make another right.

31:15.237 --> 31:18.138
The target is still stopped.
You should have him.

31:18.707 --> 31:21.073
Nurse Adler to Oncology.

31:21.277 --> 31:22.710
Nurse Adler to Oncology.

31:22.911 --> 31:24.538
Talk to me, Eric. Wrong floor?

31:24.713 --> 31:26.772
No, he stopped.
He's 20 feet in front of you.

31:26.949 --> 31:29.213
- No, he isn't.
- Where is he, Eric?

31:29.385 --> 31:31.649
You're ten feet away.
You're five feet...

31:32.154 --> 31:34.554
Guys, you're right next to him.

31:34.723 --> 31:36.054
Air duct?

31:36.225 --> 31:39.717
Neuro-psych evaluation
to room 422.

31:39.895 --> 31:42.420
Neuro-psych evaluation
to room 422.

31:43.866 --> 31:46.733
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

31:53.709 --> 31:56.906
Looks like we were chasing Yusef
after all.

32:00.616 --> 32:03.210
Eric, Room 423,
we need to get through this door.

32:03.385 --> 32:05.182
I'm on it.

32:06.055 --> 32:08.922
They took the body
for this iris scanner.

32:09.091 --> 32:11.252
It was all about getting
through this door.

32:11.427 --> 32:13.395
- Eric?
- It's a secure hospital door

32:13.562 --> 32:16.998
that needs an iris scan,
how easy do you want this to be?

32:19.902 --> 32:23.736
- So you're not thinking?
- We know one way in.

32:23.906 --> 32:26.500
Oh, by all means, you should
if you want to. I won't judge you.

32:26.742 --> 32:28.141
It's not exactly my first choice.

32:28.344 --> 32:29.641
Oh, so you want me to?

32:30.446 --> 32:32.471
I didn't say that.

32:33.415 --> 32:34.939
Oh, boy.

32:37.219 --> 32:39.210
Thank you, Eric.

32:40.356 --> 32:41.414
Go.

32:47.629 --> 32:49.460
Eric, we have an empty shelf.

32:49.665 --> 32:54.125
It has fluorodeoxyglucose,
tositumomab

32:54.303 --> 32:56.168
and brachytherapy canisters.

32:56.338 --> 32:59.102
- What are these?
- They're radiopharmaceuticals.

32:59.274 --> 33:00.935
Guys, it's nuclear medicine.

33:01.110 --> 33:03.476
Well, if it was here, it's gone now.

33:04.480 --> 33:07.677
Everything a terrorist needs
to make a dirty bomb.

33:18.459 --> 33:20.927
Hetty's talking to the FBI, CIA
and Vance.

33:21.095 --> 33:24.064
I alerted L.A.P.D. They were obnoxious
to me, but they're all over it.

33:24.265 --> 33:27.098
Also, we got nothing
from the hospital surveillance videos.

33:27.302 --> 33:29.361
Eric's monitoring
the city's nuclear alert sensors.

33:29.571 --> 33:32.438
- Do we know what was taken?
- Yeah, four brachytherapy canisters.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.631
Enough material
to contaminate several city blocks

33:34.809 --> 33:36.538
depending on which way
the wind is blowing.

33:36.711 --> 33:40.670
It wouldn't cause mass casualties, but
thousands of people would get sick.

33:40.882 --> 33:42.008
That's not the real threat.

33:42.183 --> 33:48.122
The real threat is the first act
of nuclear terrorism on American soil.

33:48.323 --> 33:51.520
If this happens,
nothing will ever be the same.

33:53.161 --> 33:54.492
Radiation pagers.

33:54.662 --> 33:57.790
It registers nuclear material
in case we can get close enough.

33:57.966 --> 34:00.526
It vibrates or beeps
depending on the setting.

34:01.669 --> 34:03.330
Directional radiation detector.

34:03.538 --> 34:04.869
State-of-the-art Geiger counter.

34:05.340 --> 34:07.968
- This one has a mute button.
- Ah. Give that one to Deeks.

34:08.176 --> 34:09.541
We've got a hit.

34:09.744 --> 34:11.974
A NEST sensor went off on the 10.

34:14.114 --> 34:16.675
The NEST system, a.k.a.
The Nuclear Emergency Support Team,

34:16.851 --> 34:18.375
has sensors all across the country

34:18.553 --> 34:20.817
that go off
when nuclear material crosses them.

34:22.156 --> 34:24.818
Hospital's here,
sensors went off here and here.

34:25.025 --> 34:27.824
We confirmed the wavelength
matched the missing material.

34:28.029 --> 34:31.396
Then 12 minutes later, a sensor
went off here and nothing since.

34:31.632 --> 34:35.626
Which put us in Venice.

34:35.837 --> 34:36.860
Works for me.

34:37.038 --> 34:38.733
Let's go.

34:57.892 --> 35:01.123
Well, you'd think somebody would do
our national security a favor

35:01.296 --> 35:03.526
and leave some of these bags
at home.

35:07.468 --> 35:10.460
- I'm getting a low reading.
- Me too.

35:11.039 --> 35:13.530
I got something, but it's fluctuating.

35:13.708 --> 35:16.176
He must be moving
through the crowd.

35:16.978 --> 35:19.572
- Sam, you getting anything?
- Yeah, he's here.

35:19.747 --> 35:21.715
This might be a buy, G.

35:21.883 --> 35:23.407
Eric, you got eyes?

35:23.584 --> 35:25.575
I've got a traffic camera
on the corner of Market,

35:25.753 --> 35:27.311
another on Main, a little fuzzy,

35:27.488 --> 35:30.787
and an L.A.P.D. Dash cam
sitting near the entrance.

35:36.631 --> 35:37.893
Sam, what have we got?

35:50.311 --> 35:51.744
Hey, man.

35:51.946 --> 35:54.813
- Kensi, Deeks, watch the crowd.
- Got it.

35:55.717 --> 35:57.480
Eric, do we have any other runners?

35:57.719 --> 36:00.847
I might have someone.
Heading east on Main.

36:01.089 --> 36:03.819
I got him, on my 3.
Guy in a navy coat.

36:05.593 --> 36:06.924
He's going. He's going.

37:37.852 --> 37:39.012
You okay?

37:39.220 --> 37:40.585
Yeah, your timing is fantastic.

37:41.222 --> 37:42.780
Do you recognize him?

37:42.957 --> 37:45.517
He's one of the guys
from the morgue.

37:54.101 --> 37:55.534
- Whoa, easy.
- Stay away.

37:55.703 --> 37:56.965
Everybody get back.

37:57.138 --> 37:58.867
I'll kill her, man.

37:59.040 --> 38:02.271
Calm down. Calm down.

38:03.211 --> 38:04.405
- Take him, chief.
- Aah!

38:14.555 --> 38:17.456
- What are you thinking? Bomb?
- Trigger or timer.

38:17.658 --> 38:19.592
Triggerman would
have to be nearby.

38:19.760 --> 38:21.159
Timer could go off any time.

38:23.097 --> 38:24.155
We've gotta open it now.

38:24.365 --> 38:27.095
- We could call the bomb squad.
- That's a thought.

38:27.268 --> 38:29.828
- It might take too long to get here.
- Flip for it?

38:30.004 --> 38:32.905
I was the one reaching
for Yusef'ss head.

38:33.107 --> 38:35.575
That head is looking pretty good
right now.

38:35.743 --> 38:37.472
Don't blow us up.

38:59.500 --> 39:01.024
It's not a bomb.

39:01.269 --> 39:03.396
He was here to sell it.

39:03.771 --> 39:07.207
The buyer was here, somewhere.

39:09.510 --> 39:11.944
We identified the two men.

39:12.613 --> 39:16.344
Wendell Hertz and Jake Varley,
both Canadian, both traffickers.

39:16.817 --> 39:19.411
Guns, cigarettes, prescription drugs.

39:19.620 --> 39:21.451
Who graduated to dirty bombs.

39:21.656 --> 39:24.625
No known political affiliations.
They seem to be in it for the money.

39:25.793 --> 39:28.728
Oh, and Hertz had a PET scan
at Cal West Hospital

39:28.930 --> 39:32.024
the same day Yusef was updating
the system software.

39:32.233 --> 39:33.860
Orchestrated it
to canvass the hospital.

39:35.069 --> 39:37.230
They were looking for somebody
with access.

39:37.438 --> 39:39.963
Maybe thought Yusef was vulnerable
because he was a Muslim.

39:40.341 --> 39:43.139
Paid him a call to make a deal.
He refused. It got deadly.

39:43.311 --> 39:45.541
Then he came up with the idea
of going to the morgue

39:45.713 --> 39:47.078
and stealing Yusef'ss body.

39:47.248 --> 39:48.545
What about the buyer?

39:49.250 --> 39:52.447
Unfortunately, it's buyers. Several.

39:52.653 --> 39:55.315
We hacked into Hertz's voicemail
and some encrypted e-mails.

39:55.523 --> 39:56.547
And?

39:56.724 --> 39:59.318
We ran the voicemail
through a beta version of Shibboleth,

39:59.493 --> 40:00.653
it's an accent identifier,

40:00.828 --> 40:03.353
and one of the buyers came up
as mid-mountain regional.

40:03.564 --> 40:04.895
Homegrown terrorists.

40:05.099 --> 40:07.158
- Cameras show anything?
- Nothing yet.

40:07.335 --> 40:09.428
We're running facial recognition
on the looky-loos,

40:09.604 --> 40:11.868
tracing license plates
leaving the area.

40:12.073 --> 40:13.904
We did find this.

40:14.108 --> 40:16.508
It's a home-security system
on the canals.

40:16.711 --> 40:19.839
You have footage of my tackle
and my sweet right hook? Oh.

40:21.048 --> 40:23.346
No, no,
where's the footage of the fight?

40:23.551 --> 40:25.382
This is all I got.

40:27.121 --> 40:29.589
Ow. Nice move, Diesel.

40:29.790 --> 40:31.223
D-Unit in the water.

40:31.392 --> 40:33.451
That's hilarious.
That's where I shot the guy.

40:33.628 --> 40:36.222
Where's the footage before this
of the fight?

40:36.998 --> 40:39.057
Whoa! D-Rock in the water.

40:39.233 --> 40:41.565
Know where the footage is?
It's in here.

40:41.736 --> 40:44.364
You know what it is? Awesome.

40:44.538 --> 40:46.904
I'm gonna go tell Hetty.

40:47.108 --> 40:48.871
Hetty?

40:49.310 --> 40:51.073
Hetty?

40:51.812 --> 40:53.780
It could be him. I can't be sure.

40:53.948 --> 40:55.882
Well, he had this on him.

40:56.050 --> 40:57.813
It's the makings of a dirty bomb.

40:58.019 --> 41:01.147
Wow! I mean, wow.

41:01.322 --> 41:03.085
You should feel good.

41:03.557 --> 41:04.990
I do.

41:05.159 --> 41:08.754
Hey, so I took your advice.
I tried to contact his next of kin.

41:09.730 --> 41:11.789
- Edgar, my coworker who died?
- Right.

41:11.966 --> 41:14.764
But he didn't seem to have
a next of kin, or, well, kin.

41:14.935 --> 41:17.836
And an unmarked grave,
that just didn't seem right.

41:18.039 --> 41:23.136
But then I'm like, is he an "RIP" kind
of guy or more "in loving memory"?

41:23.310 --> 41:24.971
And I really didn't have anything
to go on

41:25.146 --> 41:27.273
except that he really liked
working here.

41:27.448 --> 41:32.044
So I thought maybe he'd like to stay.

41:34.488 --> 41:36.615
I thought that I would cover
all the bases.

41:36.824 --> 41:40.988
And now Edgar can be around
the one place I know he loved.

41:41.162 --> 41:42.493
Or liked.

41:42.663 --> 41:44.255
I think.

41:44.432 --> 41:47.128
Rose, Edgar would have loved this.

41:47.468 --> 41:49.868
Ha, ha. Thanks.

41:57.278 --> 42:02.511
- That wasn't me.
- I'm not accusing, I'm offering.

42:02.683 --> 42:04.878
Congratulations are in order.

42:05.453 --> 42:08.854
Oh, I'm not so sure about that.
There's still a lot of loose ends.

42:09.023 --> 42:10.718
We don't know
where the canister is.

42:10.891 --> 42:12.381
It'll turn up.

42:12.626 --> 42:13.718
That's what I'm afraid of.

42:14.328 --> 42:17.195
That, Mr. Callen,
is tomorrow's work.

42:17.364 --> 42:19.298
Go get some rest.

42:20.634 --> 42:22.465
Good night, Hetty.

42:26.607 --> 42:27.631
Hey, Hetty.

42:31.312 --> 42:32.802
No.

42:33.013 --> 42:35.504
- You don't even know what I was...
- Absolutely not.

42:35.716 --> 42:36.978
Did you check your inbox?

42:37.184 --> 42:39.345
I redid the evaluations.

42:39.887 --> 42:41.912
In that case...

42:43.924 --> 42:44.982
once.

42:45.693 --> 42:48.594
- All right.
- On the count of three.

42:48.763 --> 42:50.856
- One.
- Wait, you haven't even stretched out.

42:51.031 --> 42:52.328
- Two.
- You haven't warmed up.

42:52.767 --> 42:54.166
Three.

42:55.503 --> 42:59.200
- Damn it.
- I told you I was good.
