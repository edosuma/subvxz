"Extra-solar object."

13:27.320 --> 13:29.710
that you guys intercepted
leaving Eros, huh?

13:29.840 --> 13:31.638
ALEX: Yeah. Of course we do.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.439
What the hell
are we waiting for?

13:33.520 --> 13:35.989
You've got an address.
This is a gunship...

13:36.080 --> 13:37.480
We have no idea
what's waiting there.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.995
No idea how long
they're sticking around.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.230
Maybe they already know

13:41.320 --> 13:42.310
that you picked up
their scent.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.880
We're not going in blind.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.030
Tycho first.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.110
Cap's right.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.600
Nobody asked you, no-neck.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.634
The protomolecule.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.720
What are we going
to do with it?

13:52.800 --> 13:54.598
Simple,
we stick it on the end of a torpedo

13:54.680 --> 13:55.955
and we fire it
into the sun.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.554
ALEX: Yeah, that'll do it.

13:57.640 --> 13:58.676
Hang on.

13:58.760 --> 14:00.592
What if there was a way
to use that sample

14:00.680 --> 14:02.353
to create a vaccine?

14:02.440 --> 14:04.318
Maybe still help
those people on Eros?

14:04.400 --> 14:05.834
Those people
are beyond help.

NAOMI: You don't know that.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.911
None of us know
what we're dealing with here.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.352
And until we do,

14:12.440 --> 14:14.796
that is too important
to destroy right now.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.792
Well, I'm not keeping it
on the <i>Roci.</i>

14:16.880 --> 14:17.950
I won't take that risk.

I sure as heck don't want
to share a bunk with that.

- Then we'll hide it.

No one even knows we
made it off Eros alive.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.680
It'll be safe.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.275
There's an idea.

You, in that suit,
planting the Martian flag

Whoa, the Earther chimes in!

16:00.200 --> 16:02.078
Yeah, I'm more Martian

16:05.960 --> 16:07.917
- Mmm-hmm.
- We chose Mars. Mars chose us.

16:08.000 --> 16:08.956
Hey, hey, he has a point,
Hillman.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.360
The only thing that
makes you a Martian

16:10.440 --> 16:12.079
is falling out of
your mother's gravity well.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.316
How many brothers and sisters
you have?

16:13.400 --> 16:14.390

the hots for you, Bobbie.

That way we'll always
have the inside scoop.

as me.

I don't use sex

16:56.800 --> 16:58.553
for a deeper investigation.

16:58.640 --> 17:00.359
After Phoebe went silent,

17:01.880 --> 17:03.712

to investigate.

they were incinerated.</i>

17:16.160 --> 17:17.752

We still don't know
what any of it means,

17:19.400 --> 17:20.914
or whether or not
Earth was involved.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.319
Expecting any UN elements?

17:22.440 --> 17:23.920
We don't anticipate
engagement.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.957
Lucky for them, because there
isn't a team on this ship

17:26.040 --> 17:27.679

for the <i>Donnie.</i>

17:28.800 --> 17:31.554

- Aye, Lieutenant.
- Prep your teams. Dismissed.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.914
Gunny.

17:38.000 --> 17:38.990
Up here.

17:47.320 --> 17:50.074
I know that you and your team
did a rotation on the <i>Donnie.</i>

17:50.160 --> 17:51.389
I knew people
on that ship, too.

17:51.480 --> 17:52.960
Captain Yao was a friend.

17:53.040 --> 17:55.350
But still, nobody knows
what really happened.

17:55.440 --> 17:56.840
We know those stealths
were Earth-built.

17:56.920 --> 17:59.913
So says Fred Johnson,
mouthpiece for OPA terrorists.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.037
And now Earth is accusing him.

18:02.120 --> 18:05.750
We will not be led into war
on anyone's leash.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.750
I was a private
during the Vesta blockade.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.958
Half the Earth's fleet
was headed to Mars,

18:17.040 --> 18:19.236
to annihilate
its former colony.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.354
If they couldn't have
what we built,

18:21.440 --> 18:23.909
they were going to pound it
back into dust.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.713
We went to bed every night
thinking that we would wake

18:27.800 --> 18:29.439
in nuclear fire.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.639
Luckily for everyone,

18:32.560 --> 18:33.914
cooler heads prevailed.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.559
We all grew up
with that story.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.599
Because it was a warning.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.439
We've managed to avoid
a shooting war

18:40.520 --> 18:42.113
with Earth up till now.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.634
That's our job.

18:43.720 --> 18:46.758
To make sure that
that war never happens.

18:47.000 --> 18:47.990
And because of Vesta,

18:48.080 --> 18:49.958
we pushed back
the terraforming project.

18:50.040 --> 18:52.271
Fifty years and 50 more.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.720
All those resources
to the military.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.110
Now, none of us will live to
see an atmosphere over Mars.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.475
That was the price.

18:57.560 --> 18:59.631
But it's still worth
fighting for.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.393
Be safe down there.

19:09.480 --> 19:10.675
SADAVIR:
<i>There's been a development.</i>

19:10.760 --> 19:12.717
The Martians dispatched
a ship to Phoebe Station,

19:12.800 --> 19:14.393
I know.
What are you doing about it?

19:14.480 --> 19:15.516
Well, that depends.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.353
I'm assuming there's nothing
left to find there.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.036
Is there?

19:20.120 --> 19:22.271
Routine scrutiny
would've passed muster,

19:22.360 --> 19:23.953
but this feels urgent.

19:24.360 --> 19:25.999
Like the Martians know
something.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.833
You need to get boots
on Phoebe first.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.673
That sounds
like your mess.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.160
And sending
a UN warship

19:31.240 --> 19:32.879
to a meaningless outpost
like Phoebe

19:32.960 --> 19:34.679
will just draw
more attention to it.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.958
If you want a weapons system
from my project,

19:38.040 --> 19:39.360
then it's our mess.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.760
Sell the UN on a story.

19:40.840 --> 19:41.830
Make it stick.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.439
SADAVIR:
We need to talk about Eros.

19:44.520 --> 19:46.955
Mars and Earth may be busy
pointing guns at each other,

19:47.080 --> 19:48.400
but those quarantine beacons

19:48.480 --> 19:50.756
won't keep people away
from Eros forever.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.309
There's already a lot more
do-gooders than we expected.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.039
- Next will be the looters.
- Then get rid of them.

19:55.120 --> 19:58.192
Yes. Of course.
I'll sacrifice what's left of my credibility

19:58.280 --> 20:00.351

20:04.120 --> 20:07.192
that could rewrite
the story of humankind,

20:07.280 --> 20:10.557
but your imagination
takes you as far as

20:10.640 --> 20:12.757
putting the bootheel
to your former colony.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.437
where no one could find her.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.195
Where she could find
her adventures.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.590
She taught herself to shoot
a bow and arrow at this tree.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.039
Nine years old.

20:35.320 --> 20:38.313
Just woke up one morning,
and taught herself.

20:39.480 --> 20:40.755

20:41.480 --> 20:43.756
Even losing her was worth it.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.832
She's a sacred
part of it now.

20:45.920 --> 20:48.037
So don't talk to me

got off Eros without him?

22:36.080 --> 22:37.753
- No.
- Ah.

22:37.960 --> 22:39.838
But he wasn't a good enough
friend to wait for you.

22:39.960 --> 22:41.599
No, no, no. Semi was right.

22:41.680 --> 22:43.160
It was stupid to wait.

22:44.480 --> 22:47.712
But Naomi made the call,
end of story for me.

22:48.440 --> 22:50.272
And when your pal
pulled a gun,

22:50.360 --> 22:51.999
might as well have
shot himself in the head...

22:52.080 --> 22:53.673
Here's what I see, okay?

22:54.320 --> 22:57.279
You seem kind of like a
trigger-happy whack job to me.

22:57.360 --> 23:00.558
So, let me lay it on the table
for you, all right?

23:00.640 --> 23:02.791
You shot my friend,

23:05.440 --> 23:07.318
like some street rat.

23:09.040 --> 23:10.633
Wow. So...

23:11.960 --> 23:15.397
If you need to square up,
you know where I am.

23:15.480 --> 23:17.551
Otherwise,
you should move on.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.438

24:44.840 --> 24:46.274
Thank God.
Are you all right?

24:46.360 --> 24:49.558
Perfect excuse
not to quit drinking, huh?

24:49.640 --> 24:50.869
This is our fault.

24:50.960 --> 24:51.996
We put you
in the crosshairs.

24:52.080 --> 24:53.639
We never should have
made you the public face

24:53.760 --> 24:55.160
- against Fred Johnson.
- It was my choice.

24:55.240 --> 24:56.993
Listen, we're going to beef
up your security detail...

24:57.080 --> 24:59.151
I'm already taking care
of that.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.276
Intel says it was
the Black Sky faction

25:02.360 --> 25:04.158
of the OPA.

25:04.240 --> 25:06.675
They caught wind
of an assassination plot.

25:06.760 --> 25:09.150
An occupational hazard
in my family.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.193
Maybe you should
take a few days.

25:12.320 --> 25:13.720
At least
skip the meeting.

25:13.840 --> 25:14.876

<i>They're mobilizing for war.</i>

25:19.320 --> 25:21.676
Martian ships are moving
throughout the system.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.353
The <i>Morrigan</i> to Titan.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.511
The <i>Africanus</i> to Callisto.

25:25.600 --> 25:26.670
And the <i>Scirocco</i> to Phoebe.

25:26.760 --> 25:28.160
What are you
recommending?

25:28.240 --> 25:30.277
That we secure all our bases
in the Outer Planets

25:30.360 --> 25:32.158
and head off their ships
wherever we can.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.196
SOUTHER:
Most of those bases

25:33.280 --> 25:35.476
are low-level research
outposts or cargo waystations.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.438
If we place our ships
in the paths of theirs...

25:37.520 --> 25:40.399
They'll know we're ready for
any planned acts of aggression.

25:40.480 --> 25:42.392
We share all those bases.
They have no right!

25:42.480 --> 25:43.709
Mars doesn't want war.

25:43.800 --> 25:44.916
They want to get back
to terraforming

25:45.000 --> 25:47.196
and building domes
for their people.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.236
Sir, if we de-escalate,

25:48.320 --> 25:49.993
I am convinced that
they'll respond in kind.

25:50.080 --> 25:53.676
And erode our position if Mars
decides not to give peace a chance?

25:53.760 --> 25:55.911
Sir, we're the most powerful
nation in the system.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.070
We need to act like that.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.429
Pride isn't power.

25:58.520 --> 26:00.273
And what vast font
of battlefield wisdom

26:00.360 --> 26:01.953
are you drawing from, Admiral?

26:02.080 --> 26:04.914
I advise that we deploy
our fleet to secure any base

26:05.040 --> 26:07.191
that might become
a Martian foothold.

26:08.720 --> 26:10.632
Madam.

26:10.720 --> 26:12.074
Do you concur?

26:18.760 --> 26:19.830
I do.

26:47.680 --> 26:49.160
I was just, um...

26:53.040 --> 26:54.554

I don't have any stuff.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.512
This thing with
you and Amos...

26:58.600 --> 26:59.795
I'm pretty sure

27:01.040 --> 27:03.600
he's not your fella, right?

27:03.680 --> 27:05.319
Sematimba was
a good man.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.232

27:11.200 --> 27:12.634
Caught in a
terrible moment,

27:12.720 --> 27:15.110
and he did what
he thought he had to.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.634
So did Amos.

27:17.520 --> 27:19.113
Antenna's busted.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.633
Amos is different.

27:23.240 --> 27:24.390
Yeah.

27:25.080 --> 27:26.560
Okay, very different.

27:26.640 --> 27:29.109
But he's not crazy
and he's not evil.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.396

28:11.280 --> 28:12.600

Tell me that you're okay.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.194
This crew

34:24.199 --> 34:25.918
is depending on me.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.469
You've put your lives
in my hands.

34:34.080 --> 34:35.309
I'm okay.

34:52.520 --> 34:53.510
(BEEPING)

35:02.360 --> 35:03.840
(BEEPING)

35:26.840 --> 35:27.990
Ha-ha!

35:32.400 --> 35:33.675
(EXHALES)

35:37.720 --> 35:39.234
Here, here.

35:51.320 --> 35:52.310
(SIGHS)

36:02.280 --> 36:03.316
(WINCES)

36:03.400 --> 36:04.470
Oh.

36:04.560 --> 36:05.960
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

36:31.400 --> 36:32.720
Sorry.

37:13.840 --> 37:14.830
What the hell?

37:14.960 --> 37:17.714
This is a ground operation,
why are we firing missiles?

37:17.800 --> 37:20.269
Command must have forgot to
check with us first, Private.

37:21.320 --> 37:22.834
Game faces on.

37:22.920 --> 37:24.149
We still have
our orders.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.718
MAN: <i>UNN command confirms
that the</i> MCRN Scirocco

37:31.800 --> 37:33.075
<i>fired five missiles</i>

37:33.160 --> 37:34.389
<i>in response
to the</i> Nathan Hale's

37:34.520 --> 37:36.239
<i>hard-burn towards Phoebe.</i>

37:38.680 --> 37:39.875
MAN: My God, they've done it.

37:39.960 --> 37:42.520
Not yet.
It takes two to play war.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.432
There's a 20-minute delay
from the A.O.

37:44.520 --> 37:45.840
By the time
we get a full assessment,

37:45.920 --> 37:47.798
the <i>Hale</i> and the <i>Scirocco</i>
could both be dust.

37:47.880 --> 37:49.280
We have to anticipate
the worst.

37:49.360 --> 37:52.432
Phoebe's a backwater
science station.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.193
What are they trying
to protect?

37:54.280 --> 37:56.397
NGUYEN: It doesn't matter.
They're making a move.

37:56.480 --> 37:59.040
As we speak, the Martians could be
preparing a strike all over the system.

37:59.120 --> 38:01.635
Have any of their other
ships changed course?

38:01.720 --> 38:04.076
Or launched?
Or done anything provocative?

38:04.160 --> 38:05.514
Madam, by the time
you see it

38:05.600 --> 38:06.954
on that display,
it will be too late...

38:07.040 --> 38:09.236
I know how the
fucking thing works.

38:09.320 --> 38:10.720
Answer my question.

38:13.160 --> 38:15.834
As of 20 minutes ago, no.

38:16.120 --> 38:18.555
That doesn't sound
like a first strike to me.

38:18.640 --> 38:21.997
The missiles are a message
to back off. Nothing more.

38:22.080 --> 38:24.470
The Captain of the <i>Hale</i> will
likely fire back on the <i>Scirocco,</i>

38:24.560 --> 38:26.233
as he's authorized to do.

38:26.320 --> 38:27.959
The <i>MCRN</i> will retaliate.

38:28.040 --> 38:30.600
Phoebe may be the spark,
but it will not end there.

38:30.680 --> 38:33.320
The Captain of the <i>Hale</i>
knows what's at stake.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.073
He's a man of restraint.

38:35.160 --> 38:36.640
He's one of our finest.

38:36.720 --> 38:37.836
You know Captain Yvgeny?

38:37.960 --> 38:40.111
Since he was a little
know-it-all at the Academy,

38:40.200 --> 38:41.600
debating me in philosophy.

38:41.680 --> 38:43.592
I promise you, sir,

38:43.720 --> 38:45.837
he is the same wise man
he was back then.

38:45.920 --> 38:50.312
The wise thing to do right now is to
target the <i>MCRN</i> fleet. System-wide.

38:50.400 --> 38:54.235
Mars isn't stupid enough to start
a war that will end civilization

38:54.320 --> 38:55.993
over a rathole like Phoebe.

38:56.760 --> 38:59.116
Let this saber-rattling
play out.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.910
We'll hold,
until we hear from the <i>Hale.</i>

39:04.080 --> 39:06.072
MAN: God have mercy on us all.

39:08.040 --> 39:10.919
I didn't know we shared
Captain Yvgeny as a friend.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.559
An exceptional man.

39:12.640 --> 39:13.710
Yes.

39:14.440 --> 39:16.432
Who never went
to the Academy.

39:25.640 --> 39:27.393
(BEEPING)

39:38.800 --> 39:39.870
MAN: <i>Command,</i>

39:39.960 --> 39:42.919
<i>the</i> Nathan Hale <i>has not
fired on the</i> Scirocco.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.515
<i>Their missiles

39:45.600 --> 39:49.310
<i>I repeat, their missiles were
not intended for us.</i>

39:49.480 --> 39:51.312
(ALL MURMURING IN RELIEF)

39:51.400 --> 39:54.632
<i>Command, be advised,
we are standing down.</i>

39:57.320 --> 39:59.915
<i>The Martians were targeting

40:00.040 --> 40:02.680
<i>which sustained

40:02.760 --> 40:04.433

40:04.520 --> 40:06.716

40:06.840 --> 40:08.638

40:32.760 --> 40:35.036
MILLER: Wish I had
your hat for you, <i>amigo.</i>

40:37.160 --> 40:39.277
Are we even now, or, uh...

40:40.880 --> 40:42.678
I still owe you one, don't I?

40:45.960 --> 40:47.679
We'll figure it out.

41:06.760 --> 41:07.750
Alex!

41:07.840 --> 41:08.830
ALEX: Yeah.

41:09.480 --> 41:10.596
What's the emergency?

41:10.680 --> 41:13.036
Okay, it's kind of
an emergency.

41:13.120 --> 41:14.793
So, listen. I'm thinking
to myself, I'm thinking,

41:14.880 --> 41:18.157
how often do we all just hang
out together and just talk,

41:18.240 --> 41:19.879
you know, without work?
No, no, without work.

41:19.960 --> 41:21.633
Hey! Listen, listen, listen.

41:21.720 --> 41:24.713
So I'm thinking to myself,
and I say to myself, "Self,

41:24.800 --> 41:26.519
"we ought to just
do that, right?"

41:26.600 --> 41:27.636
So.

41:30.360 --> 41:31.714
Vee-o-walla!

41:31.840 --> 41:33.559
- (GIGGLES)
- That's lasagna.

41:33.640 --> 41:35.120
It's <i>"voilÃ ."</i>

41:35.920 --> 41:37.149
Sit down.

41:37.840 --> 41:42.153
So that,
my hungry friends,

41:42.240 --> 41:43.833
is a Kamal family recipe.

41:43.920 --> 41:45.673
It's a staple
of the Mariner Valley.

41:45.760 --> 41:48.400
Now, granted, we had to
improvise a little bit,

41:48.480 --> 41:52.156
without any real cheese, or wheat,
or tomatoes or anything.

41:52.280 --> 41:55.478
Damn, Alex, you're getting us
really excited about this lasagna.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.796
Now, don't go judging it
before you taste it, Earther.

41:58.920 --> 42:00.513
It's not bad, Martian.

42:01.440 --> 42:04.160
You know, I remember a time on
Ceres when there was real cheese?

42:04.240 --> 42:07.517
They busted that black market
curd cartel on ninth level.

42:07.600 --> 42:09.273
Real cheddar,
from real cows.

42:09.360 --> 42:12.273
Damn, they had cheese in the
street for weeks, I remember that.

42:12.360 --> 42:14.158
Coming out of every
nook and cranny.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.118
Bricks of cheese
and wheels of cheese,

42:16.200 --> 42:17.919
and peace, love
and brotherhood,

42:18.000 --> 42:20.356
as long as that lasted.
Then, it was gone.

42:20.440 --> 42:22.113
MILLER: I busted that cartel.

42:22.200 --> 42:24.351
Yeah, it was me
and Star Helix.

42:24.440 --> 42:27.877
We confiscated about 1,000
kilos of high-grade cheddar.

42:27.960 --> 42:30.475
It was bound for some
luxury spa on Titan.

42:30.560 --> 42:32.472
That stuff was
out of Vermont, too.

42:35.600 --> 42:38.195
Craziest thing, though,
the whole shipment disappeared

42:38.280 --> 42:39.760
from the evidence lock-up
that night.

42:39.840 --> 42:41.240
- (CHUCKLES)
- So, it just vanished.

42:42.320 --> 42:43.640
Yeah, the, um...

42:45.160 --> 42:47.436
- Security cameras shorted out.
- (NAOMI GIGGLES)

42:47.520 --> 42:49.512
What?
Nobody saw nothin'.

42:50.400 --> 42:51.390
(CHUCKLES)

43:06.840 --> 43:10.390
So the Governor of Ceres

43:10.480 --> 43:12.472
gathers all the Star
Helix cops together

43:12.560 --> 43:14.233
for an ass-tearing.

43:14.360 --> 43:16.511
This guy wants to know
what is the plan

43:16.600 --> 43:18.910
for catching these
dubious, nefarious...

43:19.000 --> 43:21.037
- (NAOMI GIGGLES)
- ...cheese thieves, right?

43:22.400 --> 43:24.676
So he's there,
he's tearing us a new one.

43:24.760 --> 43:28.470
Meanwhile, the whole room
stinks like cheese farts.

43:28.560 --> 43:30.153
(ALL LAUGHING)

43:32.960 --> 43:35.031
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- I think I know that Governor.

43:36.200 --> 43:38.396
Teddy the Detector,
this guy was not!

43:39.400 --> 43:40.470
Who?

43:41.000 --> 43:42.673
Teddy the Detector!

43:42.760 --> 43:44.956
Yeah! The little kid,
the little robot,

43:45.040 --> 43:47.794
teaches you about
the air sensors, no?

43:47.880 --> 43:49.030
NAOMI: I think I'm too young.

43:49.120 --> 43:50.952
Teddy the Detector
detects...

43:51.560 --> 43:53.552
Oh, goddamn,
that was great cheese.

43:53.640 --> 43:54.710
You're right.

43:56.400 --> 43:57.993
GUNNY: (ON TABLET) <i>Cover me!
Grab target data</i>

43:58.080 --> 43:59.560

43:59.640 --> 44:00.756

44:07.520 --> 44:09.716
SUTTON: Same old shit,
"Hurry up and wait," huh?

44:19.280 --> 44:21.158
Look, Gunny, we...
We got an intel flash

44:21.240 --> 44:23.835
the <i>Hale</i> was carrying
10 times our number.

44:23.920 --> 44:25.400
We weren't going to send you
down to a slaughter.

44:25.480 --> 44:27.039
One of us is worth
20 of them.

44:28.200 --> 44:30.840
They wanted something on
Phoebe and we vaporized it.

44:30.920 --> 44:32.434
I'd say the fight's coming,
soon enough.

44:32.560 --> 44:33.755
I hope you're wrong.

44:34.880 --> 44:37.236
Earth knows the price of
escalation as well as we do.

44:37.400 --> 44:39.869
You said our job is to
prevent a war with Earth.

44:41.480 --> 44:43.631
Ever wonder
if we've got it backwards?

44:47.240 --> 44:49.072
Maybe we can't have
the dream of Mars,

44:49.160 --> 44:50.480
until we've had that war...

44:51.440 --> 44:54.512
<i>They're lighting her up!
Three tangos painted, Gunny!</i>
