WEBVTT

03:24.705 --> 03:25.706
Good morning.

03:26.248 --> 03:27.499
- Morning.
- Good morning.

03:27.625 --> 03:28.626
Good morning.

03:28.751 --> 03:31.587
So, here I am. All ready for battle.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.632
I'd better introduce you.

03:34.632 --> 03:37.051
This is Mr Peter Wakeling,
our new colleague.

03:37.051 --> 03:39.345
Mr Wakeling, Mr Hart.

03:39.470 --> 03:41.013
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

03:41.180 --> 03:43.015
- And Mr Rusbridger.
- How do you do?

03:43.140 --> 03:44.683
You're eagerly awaited, Mr Wakeling.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.477
We've been short now,
nearly two months.

03:46.477 --> 03:48.479
Well, I hope to make a difference.

03:48.479 --> 03:50.564
It may take a week or two though.

03:57.488 --> 03:58.614
Don't worry, old chap.

03:58.614 --> 04:01.408
This time of morning,
it's a kind of rule.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.119
Not too much fun and laughter.
Rather like church.

04:05.204 --> 04:06.246
Oh.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.541
Yes, I see what you mean.

04:54.712 --> 04:56.672
First day's always
a bit nerve-racking.

04:58.716 --> 05:00.592
- Yes.
- You'll get the hang of it.

05:01.260 --> 05:02.386
As for these chaps here,

05:02.511 --> 05:04.013
they'll improve somewhat
once they wake up.

05:04.138 --> 05:08.058
It's not us you have to worry about,
Mr Wakeling. We're your pals.

05:08.183 --> 05:10.978
But you'll need to get
on the right side of the old man.

05:11.103 --> 05:12.980
You mean Mr Williams?

05:14.023 --> 05:16.191
He seemed a decent sort
at the interview.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.986
A little on the frosty side, perhaps.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.701
The truth is, I didn't really get
to see too much of him.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.579
Well, you're about
to get another chance just now.

05:28.704 --> 05:29.955
His station's coming up.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.358
Mind the doors.

06:01.445 --> 06:02.488
Is he coming in here?

06:03.739 --> 06:05.449
Oh, no. He never travels with us.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.511
Good morning, gentlemen.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.346
Good morning, Mr Williams.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.279
Come along, Mr Wakeling.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.652
- Good morning, Sir James
-  Hmm.

08:02.733 --> 08:06.862
Mr Rusbridger,
why has this D19 come back to us?

08:07.029 --> 08:08.697
Mr Wright at Planning was of the view

08:08.822 --> 08:10.699
that a remittance certificate
should be attached to it.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.868
A remittance certificate
can only be issued

08:12.993 --> 08:15.204
after the D19 is authorised.

08:15.913 --> 08:18.415
Yes, I tried
to tell Mr Wright that, Mr Williams,

08:18.415 --> 08:19.917
but he simply won't have it.

08:20.042 --> 08:21.877
Then we can keep it here for now.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.048
It'll do no harm.

08:34.973 --> 08:37.309
Consider yourself very fortunate,
Mr Wakeling.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.811
Bequeathed one
of our tallest skyscrapers.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.855
Courtesy of Mr Woodward,
your predecessor.

08:47.152 --> 08:48.987
If your skyscraper
isn't very tall,

08:48.987 --> 08:52.407
or, God forbid, you work so fast
you don't have one at all,

08:52.532 --> 08:55.994
people will suspect you of not having
anything very important to do.

09:04.920 --> 09:05.921
I see.

09:08.966 --> 09:10.968
So here's your first rule,
Mr Wakeling.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.302
Keep the skyscraper high.

09:13.470 --> 09:16.223
The ladies from Chester Street, sir.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.267
Please show the ladies in, Mr Singh.

09:20.519 --> 09:23.146
Mr Middleton, your turn,

09:23.272 --> 09:25.190
if you don't mind.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.942
Of course, Mr Williams.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.950
Mr Wakeling, perhaps you'd like
to assist Mr Middleton

09:35.075 --> 09:36.952
- with the ladies.
- Of course, sir.

09:41.498 --> 09:44.251
Ladies. How are we today?

09:45.419 --> 09:47.629
We were elsewhere
in this building all yesterday.

09:48.171 --> 09:50.632
First at Parks, then at Planning...

09:50.632 --> 09:52.759
then at Cleansing and Sewage.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.553
Then just before closing yesterday,

09:54.678 --> 09:57.306
the gentleman said we were
to bring this to you.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.481
Let me speak with Mr Williams.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.692
Just a moment.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.573
Public Works,
how may I help?

10:15.657 --> 10:17.534
New here, ain't you?

10:17.534 --> 10:19.786
Yes. First day, actually.

10:20.412 --> 10:21.955
Well, you enjoy yourself, son.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.416
No end of entertainment
you'll get here.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.542
Eliza.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.711
I'm just chatting
with the young gentleman.

10:28.337 --> 10:32.174
Your letter and your petition
are very well presented.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.926
We, of course, know this from before.

10:35.052 --> 10:38.221
However, you must first take it
to Parks and Recreation

10:38.221 --> 10:39.639
on the third floor.

10:39.765 --> 10:41.683
We were there yesterday, sir.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.894
They even thought
to offer us a bench to sit on.

10:43.894 --> 10:46.396
- That's how long we was there.
- Eliza.

10:46.396 --> 10:47.647
I do apologise.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.442
And we don't wish you
any further inconvenience.

10:50.442 --> 10:53.320
So, Mr Williams has suggested
you be accompanied

10:53.445 --> 10:57.032
by a member of our staff to ensure
there's no further confusion.

10:58.617 --> 10:59.993
This is Mr Wakeling.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.789
Oh!

11:04.289 --> 11:06.041
Splendid. Er ...

11:06.750 --> 11:09.336
Splendid. Yes,
then I'll make sure, erm,

11:09.461 --> 11:11.421
all the confusion is...

11:12.881 --> 11:14.424
Well,
that's lovely, son.

11:14.549 --> 11:16.718
Then you'd better hop over
to our side of the fence.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.678
Yes, quite right.
Thank you, Mr Singh.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.806
If you ladies would care to follow me.

11:22.891 --> 11:24.851
Allow me
to lead the way, Mr Wakeling.

11:24.976 --> 11:27.938
We're perhaps more familiar
with this building than you are.

11:43.328 --> 11:45.330
Forgive me, everyone.

11:46.498 --> 11:49.876
Unfortunately, I shall be obliged
to leave early.

11:51.002 --> 11:54.172
At twenty past three.

11:54.631 --> 11:58.677
Er, Mr Middleton, perhaps you'd be
so good as to deputise in my absence?

12:02.097 --> 12:03.932
Yes, of course, Mr Williams.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.268
I'll see everything stays shipshape.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.019
Thank you, Mr Middleton.

12:14.609 --> 12:16.736
Is it really true
you may be leaving us, Miss Harris?

12:20.824 --> 12:22.492
It's not certain yet, Mr Williams.

12:26.288 --> 12:28.874
I did have my interview
and it seemed to go well.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.668
It's Lyons Corner House.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.632
So, will you become one
of those, erm...

12:37.799 --> 12:40.802
What do you call them?
Skippies? Nippies?

12:40.802 --> 12:42.929
You'll look fetching
in that apron, Miss Harris.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.307
It's an assistant
manager's post, Mr Hart.

12:45.307 --> 12:46.808
At least, once I've settled in.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.352
I wasn't trying
to be cheeky, Miss Harris.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.771
They do
an excellent treacle sponge.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.232
At least the one
on Coventry Street does.

12:57.569 --> 12:58.737
Good idea, sir.

12:58.904 --> 13:00.155
Hmm?

13:00.530 --> 13:02.032
Mr Wakeling, I mean.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.827
A playground
is what's sorely needed, love.

13:06.328 --> 13:07.704
There's nowhere
for them to play.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.081
A cesspool.
No other word for it.

13:10.081 --> 13:13.293
Rats the size of that.
And our houses backing right on to it.

13:15.712 --> 13:16.922
What on earth?

13:16.922 --> 13:18.924
You'll have
to get used to that, love.

13:29.726 --> 13:32.354
So, you were saying
it was 'K' staircase?

13:32.354 --> 13:34.397
- Yeah, the 'K' staircase.
- Right. Righto.

13:34.397 --> 13:35.899
- It's the last one.
- Yes.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.275
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome, sir.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.443
Good morning.

13:43.281 --> 13:45.033
Er, this way, ladies. If you will.

14:06.471 --> 14:07.556
Come on.

14:10.976 --> 14:13.228
-  Parks have insisted, sir...
-  That's all very well,

14:13.353 --> 14:14.646
but we've been through this before,
haven't we?

14:14.646 --> 14:16.648
- First we need all that water drained.

14:16.815 --> 14:20.235
I've explained this to you already.
Cleansing needs to look at it first.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.695
Good day, ladies.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.283
A children's playground.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.493
So, this isn't for us.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.412
But I'm sure
the Public Works Department

14:30.412 --> 14:32.080
will be pleased to assist you.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.582
Public Works?

14:34.457 --> 14:35.750
That's where he's from.

14:36.668 --> 14:37.794
You're from Public Works?

14:38.378 --> 14:40.672
Well, yes. First day, actually.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.133
Then why on earth have you brought
these good ladies here?

14:43.133 --> 14:44.593
I do apologise.

14:44.718 --> 14:47.637
Yours is an excellent scheme
and I wish you well with it.

14:47.762 --> 14:50.223
Look here, take this back
to your office at once.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.642
These ladies deserve better.

14:52.767 --> 14:53.810
Good day to you.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.722
Mr Wakeling, what may I do for you?

15:30.847 --> 15:32.891
The ladies' petition, sir.

15:33.975 --> 15:38.188
Mr Harvey at Cleansing insists,
er, that this is for us after all.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.149
Mr Harvey is quite wrong.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.278
But we can keep it here.
There's no harm.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.947
Thank you, Mr Wakeling.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.546
So, where
did you decide on in the end?

16:44.546 --> 16:47.590
Bournemouth.
Ten days starting next Monday.

16:47.590 --> 16:50.885
Oh, lovely.
You must be looking forward to it.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.722
Same guesthouse
we stayed in year before last.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.474
The lady there provides
a very nice supper.

16:57.726 --> 17:00.186
-  Next patient, please.
- Yes, Doctor.

17:01.104 --> 17:03.857
Mr Williams? Doctor will see you now.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.151
Thank you.

17:10.989 --> 17:13.366
I much prefer the beach
in Bournemouth.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.535
A pebble beach
is so uncomfortable.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.579
I couldn't agree more.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.041
Mr Williams.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.878
Please, sit down.

17:28.173 --> 17:29.382
Thank you.

17:40.769 --> 17:42.395
The results have come back.

17:45.190 --> 17:48.485
I'm afraid this time
they're pretty conclusive.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.411
It's never easy, this.

18:02.332 --> 18:03.333
Quite.

18:08.546 --> 18:10.340
And I said,
"Look, if that's what you want,

18:10.340 --> 18:11.841
then I know a place
where you can get it".

18:11.841 --> 18:14.385
That's incredibly
wicked of you.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.309
- Good evening, Miss Fry.
-  Good evening.

18:22.519 --> 18:24.145
-  Stop it.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.357
- She's still watching us.
- How can she be?

18:27.357 --> 18:29.067
She doesn't have eyes
in the back of her head.

18:29.192 --> 18:31.653
I assure you she does.

18:32.487 --> 18:33.571
If your father's in,

18:33.696 --> 18:36.032
this is a good time to talk
about you know what.

18:36.157 --> 18:37.534
Not a good time.

18:37.534 --> 18:40.078
You'll have to start
the ball rolling at some stage.

18:40.203 --> 18:42.705
Yes, but not tonight, darling.
I'm really not up for it.

18:43.248 --> 18:44.499
Besides, he's not in.

18:44.833 --> 18:46.459
But this isn't
his cinema night.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.212
Hello? Dad?

18:53.758 --> 18:56.052
He missed his cinema
on Tuesday, so he's gone tonight.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.763
As I was saying,
you can't put it off forever, dear.

18:58.888 --> 19:02.141
I don't intend still to be
in this stifling house come Christmas.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.226
Christmas?

19:03.351 --> 19:05.520
How can anyone purchase a house
and move in that sort of time?

19:05.645 --> 19:07.564
And besides, darling, it is his money.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.858
Your mother intended
that money for us all.

19:09.983 --> 19:12.610
What's he sitting on it for?
We're the ones who need it.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.279
You have to speak to him, Michael,
I mean it.

19:14.279 --> 19:15.613
Mike...

19:17.073 --> 19:19.450
- Father. What on earth?
- Oh.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.828
Dad, you gave us a start.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.621
Thought you'd gone to the pictures.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.168
- Dad, are you alright?
- Yes.

19:30.879 --> 19:32.171
I was just...

19:33.006 --> 19:36.551
sitting here, erm,
thinking things over.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.345
And then you two walked in.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.100
Will you sit for a while?

19:48.104 --> 19:49.105
- Well...
- No.

19:49.314 --> 19:51.774
We both have early starts.
I have to get ready for bed.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.568
You should too, dear.

19:53.568 --> 19:54.736
Goodnight.

20:00.825 --> 20:03.286
Well, better get going.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.747
- Heard what the boss just said.
- Yes.

20:56.339 --> 20:59.175
Come on. Mum's leaving us behind.

21:18.569 --> 21:20.446
Well done, your boy.

21:23.408 --> 21:24.450
Well done.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.254
I'm being serious.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.968
Chap like you needs a wife.

21:42.093 --> 21:46.431
As for your boy,
well, he'll come round to it.

21:46.597 --> 21:48.474
Youngsters get used to anything.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.241
Dad!

22:10.705 --> 22:11.706
Dad.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.375
Dad!

22:15.877 --> 22:17.170
Michael.

22:18.046 --> 22:19.213
Would you lock up?

22:20.882 --> 22:22.884
We're not coming down again now.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.054
Dad?

22:28.347 --> 22:29.682
Dad, are you there?

22:30.433 --> 22:31.601
Yes.

22:34.228 --> 22:35.396
Night, then.

22:35.521 --> 22:36.773
Goodnight.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.477
He's never late.

23:14.477 --> 23:16.229
Something must have happened.

23:17.480 --> 23:20.566
Daughter-in-law
said he'd left as usual this morning.

23:23.611 --> 23:26.864
Do you think we should, erm,
you know, alert the police, perhaps?

23:26.989 --> 23:29.117
Mr Williams
is hardly an infant.

23:29.242 --> 23:32.370
What will the police care that
he's a couple of hours late for work?

23:32.954 --> 23:34.789
"Couple of hours late
for work."

23:34.789 --> 23:35.957
Who would ever have thought.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.584
Leaving early yesterday. Late today.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.754
Maybe he's just, you know,
decided he's had enough.

23:41.754 --> 23:44.340
Gonna give it all up.

23:44.340 --> 23:47.802
I don't appreciate
that suggestion, Mr Hart.

23:47.802 --> 23:51.222
In fact,
I find it in rather poor taste.

23:53.474 --> 23:55.893
Pity he should choose today
of all days.

23:57.186 --> 23:59.147
Why is that, Miss Harris?

24:00.022 --> 24:03.234
Because the Lyons Corner House
have requested my reference.

24:03.234 --> 24:04.861
So, I need Mr Williams to...

24:04.986 --> 24:07.155
If it's a reference you're after,
Miss Harris,

24:07.155 --> 24:10.283
I'll be happy to step in
as Mr Williams' deputy.

24:10.408 --> 24:12.827
Hang on.
He's just a little late, that's all.

24:12.827 --> 24:14.370
- No need for you to...
-  Quite.

24:14.495 --> 24:15.913
Thank you, Mr Middleton,

24:15.913 --> 24:18.499
but I'd prefer to wait
for Mr Williams to return.

24:22.044 --> 24:24.922
How can it be that
in this resort town of ours,

24:25.047 --> 24:28.217
insomniacs converging
from every corner of the land,

24:28.342 --> 24:29.677
a fellow's not able
to buy such a thing

24:29.677 --> 24:31.304
- as a sleeping tablet?
- Oh,

24:31.429 --> 24:35.057
you don't half go on, Mr Sutherland.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.643
If you was really sleeping
as little as you say...

24:37.643 --> 24:39.312
I don't see how your brain

24:39.312 --> 24:42.690
could keep coming up
with them ridiculous phrases.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.443
Never mind your...

24:45.443 --> 24:49.405
well, "entertainments"
shall we call them.

24:49.530 --> 24:52.992
Consider, I beg you,
my last great work.

24:53.910 --> 24:55.453
"Shocking Stockings."

24:55.578 --> 24:59.332
Now, I very much suspect you judged it
to be smutty and trivial.

24:59.332 --> 25:02.752
You know very well, Mr Sutherland,
I never saw it.

25:02.877 --> 25:07.131
My point exactly. The dramatic vision
of your most loyal customer

25:07.131 --> 25:09.926
and you shun it.
You turn away with a blush.

25:10.051 --> 25:11.844
Would it have been that way in Paris?

25:12.011 --> 25:15.014
Where, triumphantly disowned
by my entire family

25:15.014 --> 25:18.100
I so deliciously misspent my youth.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.353
The night, the wine, the women,

25:20.353 --> 25:22.980
the cabaret, the Moulin Rouge.

25:22.980 --> 25:25.524
Who knows, Mrs Blake?
Had you been born French,

25:25.524 --> 25:28.486
you might even now be kicking high
those lovely legs of yours

25:28.486 --> 25:31.280
for the appreciation
of a discerning audience.

25:31.405 --> 25:33.658
Mr Sutherland, really!

25:33.658 --> 25:37.078
This little town of ours, Mrs Blake,
English it may be,

25:37.245 --> 25:39.789
but I still have
high ambitions for it.

25:39.914 --> 25:42.917
Bournemouth, Bognor Regis,
they're long beyond reach.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.711
But here, hope still lingers.

25:46.837 --> 25:49.757
I could achieve all this,

25:49.882 --> 25:53.803
all this and more for this town,
if only...

25:55.304 --> 25:56.764
if only I could sleep.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.141
Excuse me.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.771
I don't mean to intrude.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.064
You do not intrude, sir.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.900
In fact, you are most welcome
to join our conference here.

26:08.567 --> 26:09.860
That's most kind.

26:09.860 --> 26:14.073
But I wondered if I might have
a private word with the gentleman.

26:15.199 --> 26:18.619
I see, yeah.
Well, I'll leave you to it.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.081
The things that go on.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.628
Well, sir, may I take it
you're inviting me aboard?

26:27.753 --> 26:29.422
If you'd care to.

26:34.677 --> 26:37.346
Excuse me. I just thought...

26:38.139 --> 26:40.391
overhearing what you were saying...

26:40.391 --> 26:41.475
Yes.

26:42.601 --> 26:43.602
If you like...

26:47.106 --> 26:48.482
you're welcome to these.

26:51.319 --> 26:54.864
Very kind of you, old man.
It's just what I need.

26:56.699 --> 26:57.700
And...

27:05.291 --> 27:06.292
these.

27:11.672 --> 27:13.591
Rather a lot, old man.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.765
I'm grateful to you.
I'll take them off your hands.

27:20.765 --> 27:22.224
I did think about it.

27:25.770 --> 27:27.521
But I don't have it in me,
that kind of thing.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.858
Think of the inconvenience
to your landlady.

27:33.194 --> 27:35.738
Odd. I thought about exactly that.

27:42.536 --> 27:43.788
It's not

27:44.246 --> 27:46.957
perhaps quite what you think.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.045
You see...

27:51.879 --> 27:55.341
this is rather a bore, but the doctors
have given me six months.

27:56.384 --> 27:58.886
Eight or nine at a stretch.

28:00.971 --> 28:02.473
I'm so sorry.

28:06.227 --> 28:07.228
Funny.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.483
You're the first person I've told.

28:19.573 --> 28:21.659
The thing is, I just came down here.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.165
Look, you're...

28:29.041 --> 28:31.752
You're most welcome to those.
I've no more need of them.

28:34.672 --> 28:35.881
Six months.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.425
Nine.

28:38.676 --> 28:41.345
It doesn't seem long,
but it's something.

28:42.555 --> 28:46.851
Enough time to put things in order
and to live a little, if you chose to.

28:46.851 --> 28:50.521
I withdrew some cash.
It's almost half my life's savings.

28:50.521 --> 28:52.898
Look here, old chap. Enough of that.

28:53.023 --> 28:55.025
You need to be more careful.

28:59.947 --> 29:01.115
You see my problem.

29:02.408 --> 29:05.744
I withdrew this cash
and came down here to...

29:10.374 --> 29:14.044
Enjoy myself, or live a little,
as you put it.

29:15.379 --> 29:17.089
But I realise...

29:21.093 --> 29:22.511
I don't know how.

30:10.392 --> 30:11.519
Yes!

30:28.202 --> 30:29.662
Then he needed
to be tough.

30:31.705 --> 30:33.207
No, no, no. No, no.

30:34.083 --> 30:37.795
When a girl like that steals your hat,
always cheaper to buy a new one.

30:38.504 --> 30:42.007
Out with the old.
New phase of life!

30:46.804 --> 30:49.557
You see, that hat. That's not bad.

30:49.807 --> 30:52.101
That could work.
Do you know what I mean?

30:53.852 --> 30:55.896
Can you imagine something like that?

30:56.146 --> 30:58.732
I think that's good.
I'm gonna talk to him.

30:58.857 --> 31:02.778
I'm gonna talk to him,
because I think, for the right price

31:02.778 --> 31:05.406
- we can get that.
- Well, I, there's no need.

31:05.573 --> 31:07.908
- I'm gonna talk to him.
- Really?

31:12.246 --> 31:15.165
Show you something really special.
Strictly VIPs only.

31:19.378 --> 31:22.047
♪ Yes, we have no bananas

31:22.047 --> 31:24.675
♪ We have no bananas today ♪

31:24.925 --> 31:28.596
And so it falls to me to steer
the family line as a playwright.

31:29.263 --> 31:33.392
Hattie, this here is my friend,
Mr Rodney Williams of Esher, Surrey.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.978
And, do you know, that this man
before you now is grievously ill.

31:35.978 --> 31:38.355
Then why is he drinking?

31:38.355 --> 31:40.649
Why indeed?

31:40.649 --> 31:45.988
He has decided to grasp life,
what little of it remains to him.

31:46.113 --> 31:48.198
And we have to admire him for it.

31:49.658 --> 31:51.952
Don't you admire him, Hattie?

31:52.494 --> 31:55.831
If he's ill,
then this ain't good for him.

31:55.956 --> 31:59.001
Hattie, you don't understand.
This man, until yesterday

31:59.001 --> 32:03.172
was living a shell of an existence,
has sprung to life.

32:03.172 --> 32:05.591
Look. He even has a new hat.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.930
Alright, alright.
Come on, come on.

32:12.056 --> 32:14.433
What else do we know?
Who wants to be next?

32:14.433 --> 32:16.560
Yeah, I, yes.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.979
Yes, I have a song.

32:18.979 --> 32:21.231
And what can you offer us, sir?

32:21.398 --> 32:23.067
Erm, I have a...

32:23.192 --> 32:26.779
I have a little Scotch on my,
on my mother's side.

32:26.779 --> 32:28.906
Looks like you've got a little bit
of Scotch in you right now, mate.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.951
You're right, I am somewhat,

32:32.951 --> 32:36.163
but I'd like to sing you a song,
if I may.

32:36.163 --> 32:39.208
If you happen to know, erm,

32:39.541 --> 32:41.877
The Rowan Tree. Do you know the...?

32:41.877 --> 32:44.963
Rowan Tree. Old Scottish song, right?

32:44.963 --> 32:49.176
Yeah, I have a little Scotch in me.
My late wife, too.

32:49.385 --> 32:51.428
Erm, she was, erm...

34:42.247 --> 34:45.959
Come along, old man.
I'll show you another place I know.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.130
Mr Williams?

39:02.174 --> 39:03.717
Mr Williams?

39:04.301 --> 39:06.470
Oh! Oh, it is you.

39:06.595 --> 39:10.348
I was quite thrown there for a minute.
I mean, by your new hat.

39:10.348 --> 39:13.018
Ah, yes. I lost my old one.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.479
Well, it's jolly nice.

39:15.604 --> 39:17.397
I do wonder what they'll make of it
at the office.

39:17.397 --> 39:20.067
Yes. I wonder

39:21.109 --> 39:23.236
What would be your guess, Miss Harris?

39:23.236 --> 39:26.490
Will my new hat go down a storm there?

39:28.116 --> 39:31.411
Noah himself couldn't get something
to go down a storm with that lot.

39:31.411 --> 39:32.871
I don't need to worry
about them any more,

39:33.080 --> 39:34.331
because I have a new job

39:34.456 --> 39:37.542
- Oh, yes?
- That's why I'm so pleased to see you.

39:37.542 --> 39:40.087
Well, it's not the only reason,
of course.

39:40.212 --> 39:43.173
I'm very glad to see that you're well
and going about your business.

39:43.173 --> 39:46.301
When you didn't come in yesterday,
and the day before...

39:46.426 --> 39:49.304
Yes, I have rather gone to ground.

39:49.429 --> 39:53.225
But you see, I've had other, erm...

39:53.892 --> 39:58.772
Never mind. Tell me more
about your new job, Miss Harris.

39:58.772 --> 40:00.690
You know about it, Mr Williams.

40:00.690 --> 40:03.568
It's the position
at the Lyons Corner House.

40:03.693 --> 40:05.904
A branch just around the corner
from here.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.739
An assistant manager's role.

40:07.864 --> 40:09.991
At least once I get
into the swing of things.

40:10.617 --> 40:12.410
I'm so excited. Sorry.

40:12.577 --> 40:13.578
No.

40:13.703 --> 40:15.539
- I didn't mean...
- Don't worry.

40:15.664 --> 40:17.582
County Hall is not for everyone.

40:21.044 --> 40:24.089
I am pleased to see you, Mr Williams.
I'm going to be honest.

40:24.214 --> 40:27.551
I do have the job,
but it's subject to a reference.

40:27.676 --> 40:29.594
- Ah.
- And because you were away...

40:29.594 --> 40:32.389
I see how
I may have inconvenienced you.

40:33.849 --> 40:38.520
I was thinking of treating myself
to a light lunch at Fortnum's.

40:40.438 --> 40:41.815
If you'd care to join me,

40:41.982 --> 40:43.775
I could write your reference
over lunch.

40:44.734 --> 40:46.945
- Really?
- Why not?

40:47.070 --> 40:49.865
It might make up
for the inconvenience I've caused you.

40:51.241 --> 40:52.284
Fortnum's?

40:55.912 --> 40:58.039
You know, Mr Williams,
when I see you bowed

40:58.165 --> 40:59.708
over your paperwork like that

40:59.708 --> 41:01.877
I suddenly remember
you are the same person.

41:02.878 --> 41:05.088
The one at the head of our desk,
every morning and afternoon

41:05.213 --> 41:08.175
for the last 16 months of my life.

41:12.053 --> 41:14.222
But now I realise,
you're not really like that at all.

41:15.599 --> 41:16.975
There's so much more to you.

41:18.351 --> 41:20.103
I mean, Fortnum's!

41:20.228 --> 41:21.313
Your new hat.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.732
I won't give you
a more favourable reference

41:23.732 --> 41:25.483
because you say things like that.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.405
I'm not trying to butter you up,
Mr Williams.

41:31.573 --> 41:33.742
I'm saying I got you wrong,
that's all.

41:43.043 --> 41:45.212
Mr Williams, if you promise,

41:45.212 --> 41:47.339
and I mean really promise
to not get angry,

41:47.464 --> 41:50.133
I'll tell you my secret nickname
for you.

41:56.473 --> 41:59.226
- I promise.
- And you really mustn't get cross.

41:59.643 --> 42:01.770
It's not just you.
I have them for everyone.

42:01.895 --> 42:05.148
Only I know about them and my cousin,
Rosemary, who I share rooms with.

42:05.273 --> 42:06.274
I see.

42:06.399 --> 42:09.027
For instance, Mr Rusbridger.

42:09.027 --> 42:10.904
I call him The Hover Man.

42:11.029 --> 42:13.240
Because he just hovers his pen
over the page

42:13.823 --> 42:18.078
with the intention of doing work
but never actually doing work.

42:23.833 --> 42:25.543
And Mr Hart.

42:26.211 --> 42:27.587
Well...

42:27.796 --> 42:29.506
I call him The Confused Chimney.

42:30.257 --> 42:33.593
Because he's constantly smoking
and constantly bewildered.

42:34.844 --> 42:36.596
Have you seen his eyebrows?

42:39.015 --> 42:40.934
Mr Rusbridger,
on my desk.

42:40.934 --> 42:42.310
Doesn't have a clue.

42:42.852 --> 42:44.437
It's very good.

42:44.562 --> 42:47.983
Alright. This time, I'll say the name,
you have to guess who it is.

42:47.983 --> 42:51.528
He's on the fourth floor.
Julius Caesar.

42:52.445 --> 42:55.240
Julius Caesar. Well...

42:55.657 --> 42:58.159
I suppose that would be,

42:58.285 --> 43:01.204
er, Mr Brown, in accounts?

43:01.621 --> 43:02.622
Correct!

43:06.376 --> 43:08.545
Excuse me.
May I get you something else?

43:08.670 --> 43:09.754
A dessert?

43:11.214 --> 43:15.719
Erm, not for me.
But perhaps the young lady might.

43:15.844 --> 43:17.178
Yes.

43:17.178 --> 43:20.140
Oh, I've always wanted one
of those ice-cream sundaes.

43:20.265 --> 43:21.683
A Knickerbocker Glory, miss?

43:21.850 --> 43:23.893
Yes, please.
With the fruit and nuts on top.

43:24.019 --> 43:25.854
- Of course.
- Thank you so much.

43:27.022 --> 43:28.940
Are you sure this is alright?

43:29.357 --> 43:30.650
Of course.

43:33.320 --> 43:37.240
But, Miss Harris, you haven't
come around to your main point.

43:38.825 --> 43:40.785
You were going
to tell me your name for me.

43:42.370 --> 43:45.165
Oh, no, it's a silly nickname.

43:45.290 --> 43:46.416
I don't think I'll tell you.

43:46.541 --> 43:49.294
No, no. You've come this far.
You have to tell me.

43:52.714 --> 43:53.715
Alright.

43:53.840 --> 43:56.760
Remember your promise.
To not get angry.

43:59.554 --> 44:00.555
Mr Zombie.

44:01.389 --> 44:02.432
Mr what?

44:03.308 --> 44:04.351
Thank you.

44:05.560 --> 44:06.853
Mr Zombie.

44:07.354 --> 44:11.316
I saw a film about it
with what's her name.

44:11.775 --> 44:12.817
Erm...

44:12.817 --> 44:15.737
Zombies are sort
of like Egyptian mummies,

44:16.446 --> 44:19.824
but they can walk
and go about doing things.

44:20.450 --> 44:22.285
They're sort of dead but not dead.

44:24.746 --> 44:25.955
Mr Zombie.

44:26.581 --> 44:28.792
My, my.

44:33.046 --> 44:36.091
I'm so sorry, Mr Williams.
That's really wicked of me.

44:37.592 --> 44:39.803
You mustn't be upset, Miss Harris.

44:41.137 --> 44:43.640
Mr Zombie. It's rather good.

44:44.516 --> 44:47.685
It's quite appropriate, in fact.
I like it. Mr Zombie.

44:48.228 --> 44:50.063
An Egyptian mummy.

44:50.730 --> 44:53.942
- Except I can move about.

44:53.942 --> 44:56.653
- Your Knickerbocker Glory, miss.
- Thank you so much.

44:58.405 --> 44:59.781
Mmm.

46:11.644 --> 46:14.981
I'd better be on the 4:56.

46:15.106 --> 46:18.234
Or else I might find myself sharing
the same train as our colleagues.

46:18.401 --> 46:19.944
That would be awkward.

46:19.944 --> 46:22.655
I do wonder,
we haven't been terribly wicked?

46:24.365 --> 46:27.744
You don't have to worry about
that any more, Miss Harris.

46:27.744 --> 46:30.455
You just keep your mind
on your Lyons Corner House.

46:30.622 --> 46:33.124
I will. I was thinking about you.

46:33.291 --> 46:34.292
Ah!

46:36.044 --> 46:37.378
Don't worry about me.

46:38.838 --> 46:40.381
I've had a wonderful afternoon.

46:40.381 --> 46:42.592
- So have I.
- Well, Miss Harris...

46:44.344 --> 46:47.555
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr Williams.

47:06.658 --> 47:08.743
No doubt
she'll pop back Monday.

47:12.288 --> 47:14.916
It's rather bad form really, isn't it?

47:14.916 --> 47:16.209
Even if she is leaving.

47:16.376 --> 47:18.002
We know
it's a Lyons Corner House.

47:19.504 --> 47:21.923
Er, Mr Middleton, as Acting Head

47:22.048 --> 47:24.217
wouldn't you be able simply
to look it up?

47:27.262 --> 47:29.639
That would be highly irregular,
Mr Rusbridger.

47:30.390 --> 47:33.851
What, even if there may be far more
than curiosity at stake?

47:34.018 --> 47:37.355
Look, really! Really. I...

47:39.440 --> 47:43.403
I do wish Mr Williams would come back.
Perhaps things would go back to

47:43.528 --> 47:45.655
being a bit more orderly.

47:59.544 --> 48:01.879
People in this neighbourhood
go up to town

48:01.879 --> 48:03.798
and if they were
to see your father-in-law,

48:03.923 --> 48:06.259
just as I did, with this young woman

48:06.259 --> 48:09.971
goodness knows what they would think
and how would that reflect on you

48:09.971 --> 48:12.348
living in the same household?

48:13.391 --> 48:15.935
That's why I just wanted to tell you.
Well, good evening.

48:16.060 --> 48:17.061
Come on.

48:17.228 --> 48:18.855
The woman
is a public nuisance.

48:21.399 --> 48:23.443
A prize mischief maker.

48:24.652 --> 48:26.154
Nothing she likes better
than to put...

48:26.279 --> 48:27.280
Shh!

48:30.033 --> 48:31.200
Look, are...

48:32.493 --> 48:34.287
Are we really supposed
to believe that my...

48:34.287 --> 48:35.830
You have to speak to him.

48:35.830 --> 48:38.124
If people are talking
about this here.

48:48.176 --> 48:49.886
Look here.
There's something

48:50.053 --> 48:52.472
I want to share with you both.

48:53.806 --> 48:55.016
It's, erm...

48:56.184 --> 48:58.061
It's a bit of a bore, really.

48:58.394 --> 49:00.355
But, erm...

49:01.731 --> 49:04.525
I probably should, erm...

49:14.952 --> 49:16.079
It's outrageous.

49:16.954 --> 49:18.289
At his age.

49:22.835 --> 49:25.922
And as for this girl. Barely a woman.

49:26.631 --> 49:28.633
- Certainly not a lady.
- It does all fit.

49:28.758 --> 49:30.843
The calls from his office.
The savings.

49:31.010 --> 49:32.845
You simply must speak to him.

49:32.845 --> 49:34.931
You should have done so long ago.
About everything.

49:35.056 --> 49:36.474
I'll speak to him, alright.

49:39.185 --> 49:42.105
With pleasure, I'll speak to him.

49:45.233 --> 49:46.567
Look here.

49:46.693 --> 49:51.656
There's something I should probably
talk to you, erm, about.

49:55.868 --> 49:56.869
I...

50:10.466 --> 50:12.969
Oh, here you are, Father.

50:26.232 --> 50:27.400
Smells wonderful.

50:28.443 --> 50:30.528
Er, yes. I do hope you'll enjoy it.

50:39.412 --> 50:40.413
Mmm.

50:41.664 --> 50:44.876
Alf Jordan sprained his ankle
while on holiday.

50:45.668 --> 50:47.587
Unlikely to be fit
for the start of the season.

50:47.587 --> 50:49.297
Oh dear. How unfortunate.

50:51.924 --> 50:53.551
It's a bit of a...

50:54.594 --> 50:56.596
bit of a bore, really.

50:56.596 --> 50:59.182
Darling, this is hardly the time
to be reading.

51:00.558 --> 51:02.143
Sorry.

51:02.310 --> 51:03.561
Are we ready?

51:03.686 --> 51:04.896
Of course, we're ready.

51:04.896 --> 51:06.606
Ready as we'll ever be.

51:12.445 --> 51:13.738
Shepherd's pie.

51:13.863 --> 51:16.365
Yes. And decent mince too.

51:34.133 --> 51:35.134
Shall I serve?

51:37.053 --> 51:38.054
No.

51:47.688 --> 51:48.731
Ah...

51:50.066 --> 51:51.150
how splendid.

52:02.411 --> 52:03.496
Thank you, darling.

52:29.981 --> 52:33.150
There was a time
when what one did in London

52:33.150 --> 52:34.318
stayed in London.

52:34.318 --> 52:37.572
But these days,
half of the street works in London.

52:41.701 --> 52:43.202
Well, that's right, my dear.

52:46.581 --> 52:48.416
Half the street.

55:16.814 --> 55:17.815
Miss?

55:18.357 --> 55:19.525
Miss!

55:20.401 --> 55:22.236
The sausage roll is cold.

55:22.403 --> 55:23.863
Oh, I'm so sorry.

55:24.113 --> 55:26.240
-  Miss?
- Yes. One minute, sir.

55:26.240 --> 55:27.491
You're new here, aren't you?

55:27.616 --> 55:29.702
Haven't quite found your feet yet.

55:31.537 --> 55:33.122
Shall I bring you
something else, madam?

55:33.122 --> 55:34.498
Some, some more tea, perhaps?

55:35.374 --> 55:36.625
I shall think about it.

55:38.377 --> 55:39.420
Excuse me.

55:39.545 --> 55:40.713
Miss? Miss!

55:42.298 --> 55:44.175
Make it snappy, please.
It's getting very busy.

55:44.175 --> 55:45.301
Of course, Mr Adams.

55:45.426 --> 55:46.719
Mr Williams.

55:46.886 --> 55:48.471
Skiving again.

55:48.471 --> 55:49.597
I'm disappointed.

55:49.597 --> 55:51.599
And, Miss Harris,
I'm disappointed to find you,

55:51.766 --> 55:54.185
well into your third week here,
still working as a waitress.

55:54.310 --> 55:56.979
It was an assistant manager's post
you accepted?

55:56.979 --> 55:58.147
Yes.

55:58.606 --> 56:01.108
Well, I hope to be given
greater responsibilities in good time.

56:01.108 --> 56:03.444
If you wish,
I might speak with your supervisor.

56:03.569 --> 56:05.321
No, that won't be necessary,
thank you.

56:05.863 --> 56:07.656
Mr Williams, why haven't you returned
to the office?

56:07.656 --> 56:09.283
You did say, last time,
that you would.

56:09.408 --> 56:10.409
Yes.

56:10.534 --> 56:13.537
As it happens,
I was just now thinking about that.

56:14.288 --> 56:16.415
Erm, after all, it's not as if

56:16.582 --> 56:19.877
I've found a wealth of other ways
to occupy my time.

56:20.002 --> 56:21.170
Mr Williams, it's very busy.

56:21.170 --> 56:23.506
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, of course, I'll let you go.

56:23.631 --> 56:25.424
But, I am...

56:27.301 --> 56:29.678
I did wonder
when your present shift ended.

56:31.055 --> 56:32.515
Why would you mind about that?

56:33.516 --> 56:34.683
Why?

56:35.434 --> 56:37.520
Well, for one thing,
because they're showing

56:37.520 --> 56:40.022
I Was A Male War Bride
at the pictures.

56:40.147 --> 56:42.149
And I wondered
if you'd care to come along.

56:42.274 --> 56:44.693
No, I shan't be encouraging
this skiving any longer.

56:45.402 --> 56:47.196
You need to get
back to the office, alright?

56:47.321 --> 56:48.405
What will they be thinking?

56:48.405 --> 56:51.075
- Er, yes. But, you see, today...

56:52.493 --> 56:55.454
...is my pictures day.

56:57.248 --> 57:00.543
Er, and I was merely wishing
for a companion.

57:01.585 --> 57:02.628
Oh, well.

57:06.757 --> 57:08.551
Cary Grant, Miss Harris.

57:09.718 --> 57:13.055
I understood you were...
quite fond of him.

57:15.516 --> 57:17.309
Any female trouble?

57:17.601 --> 57:19.770
Nothing much, Sergeant.

57:23.941 --> 57:26.026
Have you ever had any children before?

57:26.193 --> 57:28.070
Oh, my aching back.

57:28.195 --> 57:30.156
You know
that awful feeling before breakfast?

57:30.322 --> 57:31.323
No, Captain, I don't.

57:31.323 --> 57:32.491
Oh, Sergeant, you're lucky.

57:42.459 --> 57:43.460
Yes!

57:43.711 --> 57:44.753
- Ha!

57:52.595 --> 57:53.804
Mr Williams.

57:53.804 --> 57:56.348
It's time I was going home.
My cousin will be getting concerned.

57:56.515 --> 57:57.641
Oh, of course.

57:57.641 --> 57:59.393
But, erm, look at this.

57:59.518 --> 58:02.188
It may seem easy,
but I assure you it isn't.

58:04.857 --> 58:06.066
Look.

58:10.571 --> 58:11.614
Ohh.

58:11.822 --> 58:13.324
It's so difficult.

58:13.449 --> 58:15.075
Mr Williams, I really must be going.

58:15.284 --> 58:17.036
Oh. Oh, of course.

58:17.161 --> 58:18.162
But before you go, Miss Harris,

58:18.162 --> 58:20.289
wouldn't you like
to have a try yourself?

58:20.414 --> 58:22.917
I have a feeling, you see,
that you'd be rather good at this.

58:23.083 --> 58:24.293
It's the rabbit.

58:24.585 --> 58:26.170
It's the rabbit we're after.

58:26.170 --> 58:28.005
Very well. Just once. Then I'll go.

58:42.853 --> 58:44.813
It's not nearly as easy as it, erm...

58:47.524 --> 58:50.736
Oh, I say!

58:51.028 --> 58:53.447
Well done, Miss Harris, well done.

58:53.447 --> 58:55.199
I might have known you could do it.

58:57.159 --> 58:58.661
Right. Now I'm going.

58:58.869 --> 59:00.162
Yes, of course.

59:00.913 --> 59:02.706
I'll walk you to your bus.

59:03.207 --> 59:04.375
Bravo, Miss Harris.

59:14.009 --> 59:15.261
Miss Harris?

59:21.475 --> 59:22.810
What is it, Mr Williams?

59:22.977 --> 59:23.978
I wondered...

59:24.603 --> 59:27.856
if you'd... join me for a drink.

59:28.691 --> 59:31.360
A few mins, that's all.

59:33.404 --> 59:34.863
Because you see, I...

59:36.573 --> 59:41.620
...I don't... I don't feel quite able
to go home just yet.

1:00:00.597 --> 1:00:03.517
Oh, this isn't very nice, really,
is it, Mr Williams?

1:00:04.643 --> 1:00:07.896
I know it's quite innocent,
and I'm not implying anything, but...

1:00:11.191 --> 1:00:12.943
Well, you're much older than me.

1:00:14.403 --> 1:00:17.906
And someone,
someone might suppose that...

1:00:20.159 --> 1:00:21.827
you're becoming infatuated.

1:00:28.792 --> 1:00:30.711
Infatuated?

1:00:37.885 --> 1:00:41.638
I suppose, in a way, I am.

1:00:42.431 --> 1:00:47.019
But not quite as some might suppose.

1:00:48.395 --> 1:00:53.692
I realised, since you arrived,
how very different it had been.

1:00:54.109 --> 1:00:58.655
I confess I did at times worry
if your attitude was, well...

1:01:00.783 --> 1:01:01.784
appropriate.

1:01:01.784 --> 1:01:04.703
But I came to appreciate you.

1:01:04.703 --> 1:01:08.791
And, and not, not simply
for your youth.

1:01:08.916 --> 1:01:11.418
There was some other quality.

1:01:11.543 --> 1:01:12.795
Your...

1:01:12.961 --> 1:01:14.338
appetite for life.

1:01:14.463 --> 1:01:17.132
Your... the way you always make
everything jolly and gay.

1:01:17.132 --> 1:01:19.760
Even while working there with us.

1:01:19.927 --> 1:01:21.261
Mr Williams...

1:01:21.261 --> 1:01:24.390
I'm-- I'm just an ordinary person
like everybody else.

1:01:25.140 --> 1:01:27.726
I-- I have no such special quality.

1:01:28.227 --> 1:01:29.770
I try to stay cheerful.

1:01:29.895 --> 1:01:30.938
That's true, but--

1:01:30.938 --> 1:01:33.857
Miss Harris,
I wonder if I may confide in you.

1:01:36.527 --> 1:01:39.863
There's something
I haven't really told anyone else.

1:01:40.197 --> 1:01:41.490
Not even my son.

1:01:44.326 --> 1:01:46.370
It's quite...

1:01:48.831 --> 1:01:51.291
a bore, really, but the fact is...

1:01:56.880 --> 1:01:59.341
The fact is I'm not expected
to live much longer.

1:02:00.801 --> 1:02:02.469
I have a cancer. Here.

1:02:08.225 --> 1:02:11.562
After receiving my news, I...

1:02:13.313 --> 1:02:16.108
I took to looking
around myself a little.

1:02:16.275 --> 1:02:18.735
And that day
I saw you in Piccadilly...

1:02:20.612 --> 1:02:22.239
I thought, "Look at her.

1:02:24.658 --> 1:02:26.285
"Look at Miss Harris.

1:02:29.329 --> 1:02:32.332
"If I'm only to be alive like her
for one day."

1:02:36.545 --> 1:02:38.005
I suppose I...

1:02:38.714 --> 1:02:41.049
I hoped you'd show me, or...

1:02:41.675 --> 1:02:43.552
teach me to be like you.

1:02:44.553 --> 1:02:47.764
Mr Williams... your son.

1:02:47.764 --> 1:02:49.433
Why haven't you told your son?

1:02:49.641 --> 1:02:50.767
Well...

1:02:53.896 --> 1:02:55.647
I think the world of Michael.

1:02:58.108 --> 1:02:59.610
However, he's now...

1:03:02.738 --> 1:03:04.406
He has his own life to live,

1:03:04.406 --> 1:03:06.992
his own concerns,
and that's as it should be.

1:03:09.411 --> 1:03:12.080
But you're correct.
I'm behaving like an old fool.

1:03:14.458 --> 1:03:16.418
What was it, your name for me?

1:03:18.128 --> 1:03:19.129
Mr Zombie.

1:03:19.254 --> 1:03:22.674
Yes. Mr Zombie.

1:03:23.133 --> 1:03:24.843
I wasn't always.

1:03:26.678 --> 1:03:28.055
When I was your age,

1:03:28.388 --> 1:03:30.516
from when I was this high,

1:03:31.475 --> 1:03:32.976
what I wanted...

1:03:36.688 --> 1:03:38.023
was to be a gentleman.

1:03:39.650 --> 1:03:42.486
Nothing grand. Just a rank
and file sort of gentleman.

1:03:45.614 --> 1:03:48.700
I used to see them in the mornings,
all lined up at the railway station,

1:03:48.700 --> 1:03:52.621
whenever I went there with my mother
in their suits and hats,

1:03:52.621 --> 1:03:54.873
waiting on the platform
to go into London.

1:03:54.998 --> 1:03:57.167
A gentleman like that.

1:03:57.918 --> 1:03:59.211
That's what...

1:03:59.419 --> 1:04:01.630
That's what I longed to be one day.

1:04:13.517 --> 1:04:14.851
How did it happen?

1:04:18.564 --> 1:04:20.774
I fancy it just crept up on me.

1:04:20.899 --> 1:04:23.610
Just one day proceeding the next.

1:04:24.528 --> 1:04:26.989
A small wonder I didn't notice...

1:04:27.906 --> 1:04:29.449
what I was becoming.

1:04:33.245 --> 1:04:35.163
And then I looked at you.

1:04:38.959 --> 1:04:40.210
And I remembered...

1:04:42.796 --> 1:04:45.465
what it was like
to be alive like that.

1:04:54.683 --> 1:04:57.060
I wonder if you ever stop
on the way home

1:04:57.227 --> 1:04:58.812
and watch the children playing.

1:05:00.397 --> 1:05:02.691
In the street, or in the yard.

1:05:03.692 --> 1:05:06.612
And when the time comes
and their mothers call them in,

1:05:07.154 --> 1:05:12.409
they're often reluctant.
They, they get a little contrary.

1:05:12.409 --> 1:05:14.494
But that's as it should be.

1:05:15.996 --> 1:05:19.082
Far better that than to be the child
you occasionally see,

1:05:19.082 --> 1:05:23.462
he's sitting by himself in the corner
not taking part

1:05:24.630 --> 1:05:26.340
not happy, not unhappy.

1:05:26.340 --> 1:05:28.425
Merely waiting
for his mother to call him in.

1:05:32.512 --> 1:05:35.474
I've become afraid
that I might end up like that child.

1:05:37.601 --> 1:05:41.396
And I so very much
do not wish to do so.

1:05:45.317 --> 1:05:49.780
When the time comes,
when my Maker calls me...

1:06:08.131 --> 1:06:09.216
Miss Harris...

1:06:10.550 --> 1:06:13.428
I hope you'll able to forgive me.
Please forgive me for everything.

1:06:13.428 --> 1:06:15.681
I've kept you far too long.

1:06:15.681 --> 1:06:17.432
We must get you to your bus stop.

1:06:18.392 --> 1:06:20.811
Mr Williams, are you all right?

1:06:21.645 --> 1:06:24.898
Never better. But we must hurry.
Your cousin will be anxious.

1:06:38.036 --> 1:06:40.205
Good morning, Mr Singh.
Would you come with me.

1:06:42.791 --> 1:06:45.293
-  Good morning, everyone.
-  Oh, Mr Williams, sir.

1:06:45.919 --> 1:06:47.921
- Welcome back, sir.
- Mr Hart.

1:06:48.213 --> 1:06:50.632
Our file on the bomb site
at Chester Street.

1:06:50.632 --> 1:06:51.717
Erm...

1:06:51.717 --> 1:06:53.593
The one that the local ladies
have been petitioning

1:06:53.593 --> 1:06:54.928
to turn into a children's playground.

1:06:55.137 --> 1:06:56.179
Ah! Now, I believe...

1:06:56.930 --> 1:06:58.932
Erm, I believe it's, uh...

1:06:59.057 --> 1:07:01.268
Yes, sir. I believe
Mr Rusbridger has it.

1:07:01.810 --> 1:07:05.439
Yes. Mr Rusbridger, you took it off
of Mr Williams' desk last Friday,

1:07:05.439 --> 1:07:07.107
the last time the ladies were here.

1:07:07.274 --> 1:07:08.900
- Well, Mr Rusbridger.
- Yes, sir. I suppose I did.

1:07:08.900 --> 1:07:10.485
So, it must be here somewhere.

1:07:10.485 --> 1:07:12.487
Mr Wakeling, you say
the ladies have been here again?

1:07:12.487 --> 1:07:13.822
- As recently as Friday?
-  Last Friday, sir.

1:07:13.989 --> 1:07:15.532
Yes, here it is.

1:07:15.699 --> 1:07:17.325
We have just enough time before lunch.

1:07:17.325 --> 1:07:18.785
I propose we go straight away.

1:07:18.785 --> 1:07:19.911
Go, sir?

1:07:20.036 --> 1:07:21.788
Mr Rusbridger, we'll will take
the file with us,

1:07:21.788 --> 1:07:23.707
but please wrap it up well.
It's pouring outside.

1:07:23.707 --> 1:07:26.001
Well, that's just it,
if I may say so, sir,

1:07:26.126 --> 1:07:27.836
it is very wet just now.

1:07:27.836 --> 1:07:29.546
I'm sure we'll manage, Mr Hart.

1:07:29.880 --> 1:07:31.047
Mrs Johnstone.

1:07:32.132 --> 1:07:33.800
We haven't been formally introduced.

1:07:34.217 --> 1:07:36.261
How do you do, Mr Williams?

1:07:36.595 --> 1:07:37.721
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1:07:37.888 --> 1:07:39.181
The pleasure is all mine.

1:07:39.181 --> 1:07:42.684
Mrs Johnstone, would you mind terribly
remaining here and holding the fort?

1:07:42.684 --> 1:07:45.187
- Certainly, sir.
- Thank you.

1:07:45.479 --> 1:07:48.648
Messrs Middleton, Hart, Rusbridger,
and Wakeling, if you'd follow me.

1:07:48.774 --> 1:07:49.941
Thank you, Mr Singh.

1:08:25.227 --> 1:08:26.311
Chester Street.

1:08:26.311 --> 1:08:29.272
District Line to Stepney Green
and then a brisk walk.

1:09:51.187 --> 1:09:53.899
It was a lovely service.
I think everyone enjoyed it.

1:09:55.108 --> 1:09:56.109
Pardon?

1:09:56.276 --> 1:09:58.278
It was a lovely service.
I think everyone enjoyed it.

1:09:58.403 --> 1:10:00.488
Yes, yes. I think so.
I think so. Yes.

1:10:16.838 --> 1:10:17.964
Good afternoon, Sir James.

1:10:18.298 --> 1:10:20.050
Jolly decent of you to show up.

1:10:20.216 --> 1:10:22.010
Good afternoon, Mr Ryman.

1:10:22.594 --> 1:10:24.262
Middleton, sir.

1:10:24.721 --> 1:10:26.598
You worked alongside him.

1:10:27.557 --> 1:10:28.892
Must be like losing family.

1:10:30.393 --> 1:10:33.939
Yes, sir.
It feels almost like that.

1:10:34.356 --> 1:10:37.067
I want you to know
how very sorry we all are.

1:10:37.233 --> 1:10:39.110
-  Very good of you, sir.
- Thank you, Sir James.

1:10:41.988 --> 1:10:43.239
Look here, Mr...

1:10:43.365 --> 1:10:44.866
- Middleton, sir.
- Middleton, quite.

1:10:45.367 --> 1:10:48.703
Erm, perhaps, you'd be good enough
to come to my office Monday morning.

1:10:49.287 --> 1:10:50.789
We might talk this over.

1:10:52.165 --> 1:10:54.084
How best to handle it from here.

1:10:55.877 --> 1:10:57.170
Of course, sir.

1:10:57.671 --> 1:11:01.716
Naturally, one wants to give credit
where it's due.

1:11:03.218 --> 1:11:06.972
But the way those ladies
have been kicking up.

1:11:08.014 --> 1:11:09.849
In the end,
it does a disservice

1:11:09.849 --> 1:11:12.811
to the memory
of our dear departed friend.

1:11:13.728 --> 1:11:15.271
Such a self-effacing fellow.

1:11:15.814 --> 1:11:19.067
If he were here,
he'd be the first to protest.

1:11:19.234 --> 1:11:20.276
Excuse me.

1:11:20.860 --> 1:11:21.903
Miss Harris.

1:11:23.780 --> 1:11:25.490
- Hello, Mr Wakeling.
- Hello.

1:11:26.533 --> 1:11:29.119
Erm, I saw you talking
with the ladies.

1:11:30.286 --> 1:11:33.289
Yes, they're very distraught.
They were so fond of him.

1:11:34.749 --> 1:11:35.792
Yes.

1:11:36.001 --> 1:11:37.711
Look, Miss Harris, erm...

1:11:39.504 --> 1:11:43.466
Well, I was, I suppose
I was just wondering if, erm...

1:11:45.927 --> 1:11:48.221
What were you wondering, Mr Wakeling?

1:11:49.347 --> 1:11:50.432
Mr Wakeling.

1:11:50.557 --> 1:11:51.599
Mr Williams.

1:11:53.643 --> 1:11:55.145
I'm sorry to raise this here.

1:11:57.313 --> 1:11:59.858
But I thought it best
to give this to you right away.

1:11:59.983 --> 1:12:00.984
Oh.

1:12:03.319 --> 1:12:04.946
It was among my father's things.

1:12:07.365 --> 1:12:08.700
Quite prominent.

1:12:08.908 --> 1:12:10.827
He's marked it
"private and confidential'.

1:12:12.954 --> 1:12:14.247
So he has.

1:12:19.377 --> 1:12:20.462
Miss Harris.

1:12:21.671 --> 1:12:23.381
We haven't been introduced, I know,

1:12:23.381 --> 1:12:25.675
but I wonder if we might have
a word in private.

1:12:26.676 --> 1:12:27.969
- In private?
- Yes.

1:12:28.386 --> 1:12:30.930
- If, if you wouldn't mind.
- Of course.

1:12:35.602 --> 1:12:38.438
- Excuse me.
- Not at all.

1:12:38.688 --> 1:12:39.731
This way.

1:12:55.955 --> 1:12:57.332
Excuse me for bringing you away.

1:12:57.499 --> 1:12:59.542
Oh, no. No, not at all.

1:13:01.669 --> 1:13:03.171
I appreciate you coming today.

1:13:03.546 --> 1:13:04.756
Thank you.

1:13:06.966 --> 1:13:08.384
I'm awfully sorry.

1:13:09.719 --> 1:13:11.262
Must be such a huge loss.

1:13:13.181 --> 1:13:14.182
It is rather.

1:13:18.269 --> 1:13:19.729
We haven't really been introduced.

1:13:19.938 --> 1:13:20.939
No.

1:13:22.440 --> 1:13:24.317
I know that you worked with him.

1:13:24.859 --> 1:13:27.487
Yes, well, only briefly.

1:13:28.363 --> 1:13:29.447
Margaret Harris.

1:13:32.784 --> 1:13:33.952
Miss Harris...

1:13:34.786 --> 1:13:36.037
How do you do?

1:13:36.162 --> 1:13:37.163
How do you do?

1:13:38.456 --> 1:13:41.376
I'm sorry, I should have come
and introduced myself earlier,

1:13:41.376 --> 1:13:44.796
- but you seemed so busy and...
- Oh, that's, that's quite alright.

1:13:50.426 --> 1:13:52.303
I really am dreadfully sorry.

1:13:54.597 --> 1:13:56.266
This must be so hard for you.

1:13:56.474 --> 1:13:57.600
One bears up.

1:14:00.103 --> 1:14:02.272
And I've been through
this sort of thing once before.

1:14:02.564 --> 1:14:03.773
Oh, yes.

1:14:05.233 --> 1:14:06.234
Miss Harris...

1:14:07.318 --> 1:14:10.321
there was something
I wished to ask you.

1:14:10.446 --> 1:14:11.447
Of course.

1:14:12.949 --> 1:14:16.286
There's something I,
I can't quite, erm...

1:14:21.875 --> 1:14:24.085
Did my father know he was ill?

1:14:28.715 --> 1:14:29.924
That he was dying?

1:14:39.392 --> 1:14:41.728
I don't know what...
I don't know what to say.

1:14:52.280 --> 1:14:53.740
Because if he knew...

1:14:56.576 --> 1:14:58.119
and he told you...

1:15:01.164 --> 1:15:02.540
You see what I mean?

1:15:06.127 --> 1:15:07.670
Why wouldn't he tell me?

1:15:08.254 --> 1:15:09.339
Well...

1:15:12.008 --> 1:15:13.551
Perhaps he...

1:15:15.970 --> 1:15:17.889
If he'd just told me...

1:15:19.349 --> 1:15:21.392
I'd never have let him
leave us like that.

1:15:23.269 --> 1:15:24.771
In all that cold.

1:15:41.871 --> 1:15:43.248
I'm sorry.

1:15:47.877 --> 1:15:49.087
Er...

1:15:52.715 --> 1:15:54.092
Thank you, Miss Harris.

1:16:12.026 --> 1:16:13.278
What's that you've got there?

1:16:18.116 --> 1:16:19.200
Nothing.

1:16:20.660 --> 1:16:22.245
I'll read it some other time.

1:16:22.870 --> 1:16:25.832
Any of you chaps get a chance
to talk to Mrs Smith?

1:16:26.541 --> 1:16:27.875
Or any of the other ladies?

1:16:29.919 --> 1:16:33.214
You know, one appreciates them
sticking up for the old man's memory.

1:16:33.381 --> 1:16:35.341
But they've quite convinced themselves

1:16:35.341 --> 1:16:38.511
that Mr Williams built
that playground entirely by himself.

1:16:44.726 --> 1:16:46.811
Parks did get more credit
than they deserved.

1:16:46.811 --> 1:16:48.771
That's because they're called Parks.

1:16:51.691 --> 1:16:53.943
Sir James certainly got his share
of the credit.

1:16:55.153 --> 1:16:56.738
Made certain of that.

1:16:57.113 --> 1:17:00.158
Sir James was quite crucial
as far as that playground's concerned.

1:17:04.704 --> 1:17:06.122
Suppose he was.

1:17:08.666 --> 1:17:10.710
You know, I, I can't help thinking.

1:17:11.085 --> 1:17:12.879
And I, I didn't know Mr Williams

1:17:12.879 --> 1:17:14.964
the way you all did,
of course, but...

1:17:16.632 --> 1:17:19.344
- ...but it does seem to me that he...
- That he changed.

1:17:21.512 --> 1:17:22.513
Yes.

1:17:23.973 --> 1:17:25.767
It was this playground business.

1:17:27.268 --> 1:17:28.561
Chester Street.

1:17:28.561 --> 1:17:30.855
District Line to Stepney Green
and then a brisk walk.

1:17:54.754 --> 1:17:56.005
No, you must...

1:17:56.005 --> 1:17:57.465
No, I insist, sir.

1:17:57.882 --> 1:17:59.050
Honestly.

1:18:10.853 --> 1:18:13.940
He was willing to traipse
through all that sewage water

1:18:13.940 --> 1:18:15.650
- just to get to the site.
-  He did become...

1:18:16.359 --> 1:18:17.527
obsessed.

1:18:18.361 --> 1:18:20.530
He was prepared to make himself
a right bugger about it.

1:18:21.030 --> 1:18:22.532
I accompanied him once to Planning.

1:18:22.532 --> 1:18:23.616
This is it here.

1:18:23.616 --> 1:18:25.410
Leave it with us and we'll send it
down to you once it's ready.

1:18:25.410 --> 1:18:28.162
That ogre Talbot
was presiding that day.

1:18:28.162 --> 1:18:30.415
Actually, I was hoping
you might see to it now,

1:18:30.540 --> 1:18:32.667
and then I could take it
off your hands straight away.

1:18:33.334 --> 1:18:36.671
Well, I'm unable to authorise it
just like that.

1:18:36.879 --> 1:18:38.506
Look, look, don't worry.

1:18:38.506 --> 1:18:40.258
I'll see it gets done.
We'll send it down to you.

1:18:41.008 --> 1:18:45.513
Why don't I wait here
while you check those entries?

1:18:48.891 --> 1:18:51.185
Well, it's up to you, but you might
find yourself waiting for some time.

1:18:51.185 --> 1:18:52.562
We've got a lot on up here.

1:18:52.562 --> 1:18:55.606
Take all the time you need, Mr Talbot.
I'm quite happy here.

1:18:55.898 --> 1:18:58.526
Mr Hart, you'd better get back.

1:18:59.402 --> 1:19:01.612
Tell the others I've been held up.

1:19:02.280 --> 1:19:03.906
Indefinitely.

1:19:04.907 --> 1:19:06.576
Of course, Mr Williams.

1:19:13.291 --> 1:19:15.668
He said he'd sit and wait
all day if he had to.

1:19:16.252 --> 1:19:17.670
And he did.

1:19:23.718 --> 1:19:25.887
This is very good of you, Mr Jones.

1:19:26.179 --> 1:19:30.475
I know we're placing an extra burden
on all of you here.

1:19:30.475 --> 1:19:32.852
So, this is what?
A kiddies' playground?

1:19:32.852 --> 1:19:33.936
Yes.

1:19:34.103 --> 1:19:35.146
Urgent?

1:19:35.521 --> 1:19:37.732
We'd appreciate
your giving it priority.

1:19:39.233 --> 1:19:41.360
Well, if you request it, Mr Williams.

1:19:41.819 --> 1:19:43.488
Thank you, Mr Jones.

1:19:48.075 --> 1:19:50.328
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

1:19:56.250 --> 1:19:58.002
Instead of just leaving...

1:19:59.462 --> 1:20:01.797
he went over
to each of them in turn...

1:20:02.340 --> 1:20:03.674
Thank you.

1:20:04.300 --> 1:20:05.843
...looked them in the face...

1:20:07.512 --> 1:20:08.763
Thank you.

1:20:08.888 --> 1:20:10.473
...and thanked them all.

1:20:11.265 --> 1:20:12.350
Thank you.

1:20:12.517 --> 1:20:13.851
Yes, of course. Anything.

1:20:13.976 --> 1:20:15.144
I appreciate it.

1:20:16.145 --> 1:20:17.188
Thank you.

1:20:17.355 --> 1:20:18.564
That's quite alright, sir.

1:20:21.734 --> 1:20:23.027
Everyone.

1:20:25.238 --> 1:20:28.032
Parks did then rather pull out
the stops, didn't they?

1:20:28.032 --> 1:20:29.116
Quite.

1:20:30.743 --> 1:20:31.911
The Mr Williams of a year ago

1:20:31.911 --> 1:20:33.746
would never thought
of doing something like that.

1:20:42.463 --> 1:20:45.883
Actually, I witnessed something
even more remarkable.

1:20:46.217 --> 1:20:49.428
I never told you chaps
at the time because...

1:20:51.138 --> 1:20:52.848
Well, it rather annoyed me.

1:20:53.015 --> 1:20:55.101
So, you see,
for all these reasons,

1:20:55.226 --> 1:20:57.061
this isn't something
we can contemplate

1:20:57.061 --> 1:20:58.813
for the foreseeable future.

1:20:59.146 --> 1:21:02.108
I'm sorry. I genuinely regret it.

1:21:02.108 --> 1:21:04.151
We'd gone
up to Sir James' office

1:21:04.151 --> 1:21:06.320
to plead a case for the playground,

1:21:06.571 --> 1:21:09.448
and Sir James rejected it.

1:21:09.574 --> 1:21:11.909
And the site is a disgrace.

1:21:13.327 --> 1:21:16.872
Unfortunately, just now,
we have even more urgent priorities.

1:21:18.583 --> 1:21:21.502
Well, thank you
for coming to see me.

1:21:23.671 --> 1:21:27.133
They're considering Anderson,
for the new editor's post at Punch.

1:21:28.175 --> 1:21:30.177
I don't fancy that, do you?

1:21:30.303 --> 1:21:31.762
Wouldn't be quite right.

1:21:31.929 --> 1:21:33.514
Man's obsessed with the ballet.

1:21:33.848 --> 1:21:36.267
Well, that's not entirely fair.

1:21:36.392 --> 1:21:38.853
Anderson also cares passionately

1:21:39.020 --> 1:21:42.356
about detective fiction and horses.

1:21:43.774 --> 1:21:46.068
Sir James...

1:21:46.819 --> 1:21:48.487
...please excuse me,

1:21:48.487 --> 1:21:52.325
but I beg you to reconsider.

1:21:53.242 --> 1:21:54.452
I beg you.

1:21:55.995 --> 1:22:00.583
Or, at least... keep the application
open for one more week.

1:22:01.584 --> 1:22:03.502
What harm can that do?

1:22:04.295 --> 1:22:05.504
He begged him.

1:22:06.339 --> 1:22:09.467
He begged him to reconsider.

1:22:09.717 --> 1:22:11.552
And he wouldn't take no for an answer.

1:22:11.844 --> 1:22:13.220
But it came off.

1:22:13.387 --> 1:22:14.805
What, what's that?

1:22:14.972 --> 1:22:16.140
It came off.

1:22:17.183 --> 1:22:19.977
It must have done.
The Chairman did reconsider.

1:22:21.228 --> 1:22:22.438
Well, yes.

1:22:23.564 --> 1:22:25.691
Yes, I suppose he did.

1:22:26.025 --> 1:22:28.110
Those ladies may have a point.

1:22:28.110 --> 1:22:30.780
Well, yes, but we all put
our shoulders to it.

1:22:30.946 --> 1:22:32.490
Yes, but...

1:22:33.240 --> 1:22:35.284
there's no denying
the old man did push it.

1:22:39.497 --> 1:22:40.998
Could it be he knew?

1:22:41.749 --> 1:22:43.084
That he didn't have long?

1:22:43.459 --> 1:22:44.919
Knowing something like that,

1:22:44.919 --> 1:22:48.547
I suppose that might...
galvanise a person.

1:22:48.673 --> 1:22:51.592
Yeah, but he didn't know.
His, his son was very clear on that.

1:22:51.967 --> 1:22:53.803
I'm pretty sure that's right.

1:23:15.658 --> 1:23:16.826
I think he did know.

1:23:27.670 --> 1:23:28.963
Ladies.

1:23:30.423 --> 1:23:32.466
We mustn't be discouraged.

1:23:33.759 --> 1:23:35.678
There will be a way around this.

1:23:36.846 --> 1:23:38.139
I assure you.

1:23:39.223 --> 1:23:41.434
I don't know how you kept
your temper just now, sir.

1:23:45.187 --> 1:23:47.648
I don't have time
to get angry, Mrs Smith.

1:23:48.190 --> 1:23:50.109
Something in the way
he said it.

1:23:50.109 --> 1:23:51.360
Ladies.

1:24:01.704 --> 1:24:05.541
Well, perhaps we'd all do the same.
All of us here.

1:24:05.666 --> 1:24:09.378
We'd work with extra urgency
in a situation like that.

1:24:09.503 --> 1:24:10.588
Would we?

1:24:10.713 --> 1:24:12.298
It's a natural reaction.

1:24:12.923 --> 1:24:14.759
Well, I don't know.

1:24:15.217 --> 1:24:16.927
I don't think everyone,

1:24:17.928 --> 1:24:19.597
we here, even,

1:24:20.598 --> 1:24:24.560
would necessarily have responded
in quite the way Mr Williams did.

1:24:26.145 --> 1:24:27.438
I agree.

1:24:30.649 --> 1:24:31.734
Hm.

1:24:33.819 --> 1:24:35.154
If he knew...

1:24:36.030 --> 1:24:39.658
he did an awfully good job
keeping it to himself.

1:25:27.122 --> 1:25:28.833
It was almost like he...

1:25:39.009 --> 1:25:40.052
Yeah.

1:25:41.554 --> 1:25:42.555
You're right.

1:25:44.431 --> 1:25:46.600
He certainly set an example for us.

1:25:53.691 --> 1:25:54.817
Look here, everyone.

1:25:58.571 --> 1:26:03.868
Let me propose that we all make
a pledge, here, today.

1:26:05.494 --> 1:26:09.498
Let's pledge to learn
from his example.

1:26:09.915 --> 1:26:13.085
This lesson he set before us.

1:26:13.586 --> 1:26:18.883
Let's vow never again to shy away
from our responsibilities.

1:26:20.426 --> 1:26:24.430
Never again to push things
under the carpet. Or upstairs.

1:26:24.430 --> 1:26:26.599
Mr Williams has shown us...

1:26:27.182 --> 1:26:29.059
Well, that if...

1:26:30.728 --> 1:26:32.229
If we put our minds to it...

1:26:32.396 --> 1:26:35.399
our backs into it,
we can do even better.

1:26:35.399 --> 1:26:36.483
That's right.

1:26:36.650 --> 1:26:38.736
And let me say this here today,

1:26:38.861 --> 1:26:41.614
while I remain
in charge of Public Works,

1:26:41.614 --> 1:26:44.199
we're going to be true
to Mr Williams' memory.

1:26:45.326 --> 1:26:47.286
We're going to get things done.

1:26:47.286 --> 1:26:48.454
- That's right.
- Hear. Hear.

1:27:08.599 --> 1:27:10.559
Reasonably brief, if you don't mind.

1:27:10.559 --> 1:27:13.228
- I'm expecting my nephew to call.
- Of course!

1:27:14.104 --> 1:27:15.314

1:28:30.681 --> 1:28:33.434
Education insist this is for us, sir.

1:28:33.434 --> 1:28:34.768
And which one is this?

1:28:34.977 --> 1:28:38.105
The disagreement
concerning the proposed prefabs

1:28:38.522 --> 1:28:40.774
at Saint Mary's School
in Shoreditch, sir.

1:28:40.899 --> 1:28:41.942
Ah, that.

1:28:42.693 --> 1:28:43.777
Mr Hart.

1:28:44.028 --> 1:28:46.572
Can you look into Saint Mary's School?

1:28:46.572 --> 1:28:48.407
That's for Education, Mr Middleton.

1:28:48.407 --> 1:28:49.533
It's a Schools matter.

1:28:49.658 --> 1:28:52.995
Even so, sir,
Education insist...

1:28:54.621 --> 1:28:55.664
Well...

1:28:57.624 --> 1:28:59.877
we can keep it here for now.

1:29:03.213 --> 1:29:04.298
No harm.

1:29:08.302 --> 1:29:09.845
The postal run, please.

1:29:13.474 --> 1:29:15.100
Mr Middleton.

1:29:17.436 --> 1:29:18.812
Yes, Mr Wakeling.

1:29:35.913 --> 1:29:38.373
I'd like this in triplicate,
please, Mrs Johnstone.

1:29:40.501 --> 1:29:42.544
That'll be all, thank you, Mr Singh.

1:30:04.566 --> 1:30:06.568
I wonder, Mr Wakeling,

1:30:06.860 --> 1:30:12.366
if I may now turn to matters
you may consider more personal.

1:30:13.951 --> 1:30:17.162
I have no wish
to belittle our playground...

1:30:17.788 --> 1:30:21.166
but I put it to you that it was,
all the same...

1:30:21.333 --> 1:30:22.793
a small thing.

1:30:23.293 --> 1:30:26.213
And that it will, before long...

1:30:26.380 --> 1:30:28.882
go the way of most small things.

1:30:31.260 --> 1:30:33.846
It may fall into disrepair,

1:30:34.012 --> 1:30:37.975
or be superseded
by some grander scheme.

1:30:39.601 --> 1:30:41.270
To speak plainly,

1:30:41.436 --> 1:30:45.899
we cannot assume to have erected
a lasting monument.

1:30:47.985 --> 1:30:51.155
Should there come days
when it's no longer clear to you

1:30:51.280 --> 1:30:54.658
to what end you are directing
your daily efforts,

1:30:55.576 --> 1:30:59.037
when the sheer grind of it all
threatens to reduce you

1:30:59.204 --> 1:31:03.292
to the kind of state
in which I so long existed...

1:31:11.341 --> 1:31:15.721
I urge you then to recall
our little playground,

1:31:16.263 --> 1:31:18.348
and the modest satisfaction

1:31:18.348 --> 1:31:21.560
that became our due
upon its completion.

1:31:41.622 --> 1:31:42.789
Evening, sir.

1:31:44.708 --> 1:31:45.709
Good evening, Officer.

1:31:47.669 --> 1:31:48.921
Everything alright?

1:31:50.005 --> 1:31:51.131
Yes.

1:31:51.340 --> 1:31:53.342
I just wanted to see
this playground again.

1:31:56.220 --> 1:31:59.598
I, I played a, a small part,

1:31:59.848 --> 1:32:03.060
just a small part, mind you,
in bringing it into being.

1:32:03.352 --> 1:32:04.937
I work at the LCC.

1:32:05.896 --> 1:32:07.231
Is that so, sir?

1:32:08.273 --> 1:32:10.567
Well, then the people here
have a lot to thank you for.

1:32:10.567 --> 1:32:11.860
Oh, I didn't do much.

1:32:11.985 --> 1:32:13.153
The man who did...

1:32:15.405 --> 1:32:17.866
the man, the man who did
passed away this winter.

1:32:18.575 --> 1:32:19.952
Mr Williams.

1:32:22.162 --> 1:32:23.205
Mr Williams.

1:32:24.122 --> 1:32:25.207
Yes.

1:32:27.167 --> 1:32:29.795
He'll be remembered round here with...

1:32:31.797 --> 1:32:33.173
respect and affection.

1:32:34.675 --> 1:32:37.886
I never actually had the honour
of meeting Mr Williams personally.

1:32:37.886 --> 1:32:40.013
He was always that busy.

1:32:43.016 --> 1:32:44.059
If you was his...

1:32:45.018 --> 1:32:47.771
friend, sir, then perhaps
you wouldn't mind my telling you this.

1:32:48.272 --> 1:32:50.357
You know, Station Sergeant
says I'm being foolish.

1:32:50.482 --> 1:32:51.608

1:32:52.359 --> 1:32:53.652

1:34:37.297 --> 1:34:38.715
disturb him.

1:34:39.883 --> 1:34:42.928
I imagined, in time, he'd just come
off that swing and go home.

1:34:50.519 --> 1:34:52.437
Mr Williams had, erm...

1:34:53.480 --> 1:34:55.440
had a terminal illness, you see.

1:34:56.983 --> 1:34:59.403

1:35:00.529 --> 1:35:02.489
