MAN [OVER PA]:
Good afternoon,
Greendale Community College.

00:05.005 --> 00:09.271
I am your dean
with a few corrections
to the fall class catalogue.

00:09.476 --> 00:12.411
Cosmology should be
Cosmetology.

00:12.612 --> 00:14.341
Astrology should be Astronomy.

00:14.547 --> 00:16.640
The students on the cover
should be smiling,

00:16.850 --> 00:18.818

that's a matter of opinion.

of cannabis behind the gymnasium,

In campus news, the debate over
our library's PA system continues,

00:37.937 --> 00:40.929
with some students suggesting
its volume be lowered

00:41.141 --> 00:43.234

its very purpose.

wait for Jeff before
we start studying.

we could talk to him,
as a group, about his tardiness.
