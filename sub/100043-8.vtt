WEBVTT

00:01.376 --> 00:04.087
Guys, I'm nailing my seating chart.

00:05.672 --> 00:07.883
Can you not put me near Luke?
I can't with the chewing.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.134
You know, you are a spoiled city kid.

00:09.218 --> 00:11.803
I was 11 before I got to sit
at the people table.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.431
Cam, I've asked you ten times.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.100
Why haven't you sent me your itinerary
for your trip to your parents' house?

00:17.184 --> 00:18.227
I've been a little busy.

00:18.227 --> 00:21.188
Okay, well, you spent three hours
making a JibJab of you, me, and Lily

00:21.188 --> 00:22.856
dancing in Santa's Twerkshop.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.107
Look at our butts.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.734
Merry Christmas. Hi.

00:25.734 --> 00:26.902
Merry Christmas.

00:26.902 --> 00:29.363
Hello, so, who's going to get me a drink?
Mama's done breastfeeding.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.533
These babies are all mine again,
and I'm ready to fill them up with wine.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.994
Oh, well, not how the human body works,
but I'm very happy for you.

00:36.119 --> 00:38.455
- Ah, I've missed old Haley.
- Oh, me, too.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.083
Oh, hey, can you move Haley
away from me and the twins?

00:41.083 --> 00:43.585
My present to her is the night off
from Mommy duties, so...

00:43.669 --> 00:45.963
Okay, but I would've appreciated
a little heads-up,

00:45.963 --> 00:47.798
but it's a thoughtful gift, so...

00:48.006 --> 00:51.802
It's also free, which is helpful because
I forgot my ATM pin last summer.

00:51.802 --> 00:54.304
Any chance I ever mentioned
my four favorite numbers to you?

00:54.388 --> 00:55.389
- No.
- Oh, no!

00:55.389 --> 00:56.723
Please move me away from Gloria.

00:56.807 --> 00:57.808
It'll be weird.

00:57.808 --> 00:59.685
Gloria's been working for my dad.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.144
He totally mentored her,

01:01.270 --> 01:02.437
<i>and then the other day,</i>

01:02.521 --> 01:05.023
<i>I caught her interviewing
with his competitors.</i>

01:05.107 --> 01:08.735
So, if I come onboard,
do I have to change my hairstyle?

01:11.196 --> 01:12.823
- We'll talk about it.
- It's kind of our thing.

01:15.117 --> 01:17.160
Word to the wise,

01:17.244 --> 01:20.205
I'm like the last five
Matthew McConaughey movies.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.498
You never saw me.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.419
Fine.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.379
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:27.379 --> 01:29.006
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:29.006 --> 01:32.050
Wow! Now this is what
a Christmas table should look like!

01:32.134 --> 01:33.135
No offense, honey.

01:33.135 --> 01:34.970
I also love your whole
"who cares" approach.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.097
Um...

01:37.181 --> 01:39.308
Cam, I can't sit next to Dad.

01:39.308 --> 01:40.601
I think he's gonna ask me
to work for his

01:40.601 --> 01:42.102
stupid dog bed company.

01:42.186 --> 01:44.146
- Claire!
- What?

01:44.146 --> 01:46.231
I can't break his heart on Christmas.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.025
You know how the holiday
makes him so sweet

01:48.025 --> 01:49.359
- and vulnerable.
- Mmm.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.696
I hate this damn scarf!
I look like Anjelica Huston.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.573
Cam bought it.
You wear it.

01:54.698 --> 01:55.741
Hey.

01:55.741 --> 01:58.160
Love the scarf. I feel like a movie star.

01:58.577 --> 02:02.080
Cam, put me next to Claire, okay?
I wanna talk to her about something.

02:02.164 --> 02:03.624
There she is!

02:03.624 --> 02:05.042
I can't wait to give you your gift.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.627
Should we open it now?
Let's open it now.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.796
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

02:09.880 --> 02:10.923
Huh?

02:11.089 --> 02:14.051
Do you get it?
20-20 vision.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.552
It works two ways.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.262
You are gonna be
on so many bus benches.

02:17.346 --> 02:20.432
And in a different way than when you had
to go somewhere before you married Jay!

02:20.766 --> 02:24.603
Wow! Dad, that is a lovely gesture.
Thank you, Alex.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.356
You always know what to say
and what not to say.

02:27.773 --> 02:29.066
Phil, you're amazing.

02:29.274 --> 02:34.530
Which is ironic, I think,
because your son might be a sociopath.

02:34.947 --> 02:36.657
Wait, what's all this then?

02:36.782 --> 02:38.116
Why don't you ask him?

02:38.784 --> 02:42.162
- Luke, what happened?
- I will tell you what happened.

02:42.246 --> 02:47.793
Instead of helping Manny get Sherry back,
he stole her for himself.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.338
It's true, Sherry and I are a thing.

02:51.338 --> 02:52.548
- Oh, my God. Wow!
- Oh, wow...

02:52.548 --> 02:56.301
- Seriously?
- Cam, take Manny off. He's not coming.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.345
Okay, fine, everybody,
just sit wherever they want,

02:58.345 --> 03:00.973
like a bunch of hobos
around a barrel fire.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.697
Luke, how could you do this?

03:16.697 --> 03:18.156
And to Manny, of all people.

03:18.240 --> 03:22.619
I feel bad, but this thing
with Sherry is special.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.872
This isn't my usual hit it and quit it.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.540
- Charming.
- That's rough on the ears.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.500
Plus, Sherry doesn't want
to be with Manny,

03:28.584 --> 03:30.460
and we really connect.

03:31.461 --> 03:34.506
Well, I... I guess
if you really care about her that much...

03:34.590 --> 03:36.675
I do. She's smart and cool,

03:36.675 --> 03:38.844
and, man, does she make me laugh.

03:38.844 --> 03:39.928
We get it.

03:40.012 --> 03:41.680
Nothing sexier than a funny woman.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.098
Or an organized one.

03:43.891 --> 03:47.311
So, what's up with you and Cam?
I'm sensing tension.

03:47.311 --> 03:48.896
I didn't sense any tension.

03:49.021 --> 03:51.732
I was just looking for some
drama and figured it was a safe bet.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.317
There is tension.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.068
- Okay, so, first of all...
- Mmm.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.029
...he's being extra crazy

03:57.029 --> 03:58.113
- about this dinner.
- Uh-huh.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.364
But now get this.

03:59.448 --> 04:01.867
Every Christmas, I complain
about having to go home with him

04:01.867 --> 04:03.327
to see his family.

04:03.327 --> 04:07.289
And this year, he said I don't have to go.
And he was totally cool about it.

04:07.289 --> 04:09.041
Oh, no. Super fishy.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.627
So you didn't find any clues
when you went through his luggage?

04:11.627 --> 04:13.337
I didn't go through his luggage.

04:13.337 --> 04:15.964
It's like you want
your marriage to fall apart. Come on.

04:16.340 --> 04:17.382
Ugh.

04:19.051 --> 04:20.844
What are we gonna do about Luke and Manny?

04:20.928 --> 04:24.014
Nothing. The last thing I want
is to get into a whole thing with Gloria.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.391
- Hey, hon, got a minute?
- Ugh. Second to last.

04:26.475 --> 04:28.477
Sorry, Dad, I got to get into
a whole thing with Gloria.

04:28.477 --> 04:31.730
Or nobody gets into anything with anybody
and we have a storybook Christmas.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.023
How about a mini cheeseball?

04:33.023 --> 04:35.275
Is Luke going to breakup with Sherry?

04:35.400 --> 04:40.072
Gloria, I am sorry that Manny is so upset,
but Luke's feelings are sincere.

04:40.072 --> 04:42.115
He's already beating himself up.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.992
Please, don't be mad at him.

04:44.326 --> 04:47.412
You're right. I shouldn't be mad at Luke.
He didn't raise himself.

04:47.788 --> 04:48.914
Uh...

04:48.914 --> 04:50.040
One more time?

04:50.040 --> 04:52.668
Based on the stories from your past,

04:52.668 --> 04:56.755
you rarely denied yourself
the pleasures of the flesh.

04:56.839 --> 04:59.258
- Okay, time out. Time out.
- Wow.

04:59.258 --> 05:02.177
Cam, Cam, why do you have a first
class ticket to Missouri?

05:02.261 --> 05:04.805
Okay, not now. And why are you
digging through my suitcase?

05:05.305 --> 05:08.809
Hey, Dad, are you just gonna stand there
while your wife calls me a tramp?

05:08.809 --> 05:10.727
I feel this is a risky time to weigh in.

05:10.811 --> 05:14.606
Agreed. No more fighting.
Let's just all enjoy a cheeseball.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.900
It's my grandma's 100-year-old recipe,

05:16.984 --> 05:19.361
except I use cayenne pepper
instead of cocaine.

05:19.361 --> 05:22.239
I'm sorry, Gloria.
No one calls my wife loose.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.616
In her day, did she enjoy
the company of a few men?

05:24.700 --> 05:27.828
Sure. Is hard to leave the house
without running into one of her ex-lovers?

05:27.828 --> 05:29.371
Depends on what city we're in.

05:29.371 --> 05:32.249
- Do you have an end to this?
- Her body, her choices,

05:32.249 --> 05:34.168
all over this beautiful planet.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.378
Can we get back
to the first class ticket thing?

05:36.378 --> 05:37.588
What are we hiding?

05:37.588 --> 05:38.714
Okay, I'm not sure
what you have to do with this,

05:38.714 --> 05:40.716
but my parents bought me that ticket.

05:40.716 --> 05:42.801
Your parents?
The people who's idea of fancy

05:42.885 --> 05:45.095
is dropping a Certs
into a jar of schnapps?

05:45.179 --> 05:47.389
I'll have you know
that Grandma's mint rockets

05:47.389 --> 05:49.683
are the cocktail of choice
at the Governor's mansion.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.226
You coddle Manny.

05:51.310 --> 05:52.895
He should already be over Sherry.

05:52.895 --> 05:55.355
But I guess that's what happens
when you let a kid

05:55.439 --> 05:58.317
- sleep in your bed till he's 15.
- 13.

05:58.317 --> 06:01.528
Why are we talking about Manny, anyway,
when this is clearly Phil's fault.

06:01.612 --> 06:02.613
What?

06:02.613 --> 06:05.657
Well, I mean, you obviously didn't teach
Luke about the gentlemen's code.

06:05.782 --> 06:06.992
I did so.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.452
Never leave a high five hanging.

06:08.452 --> 06:10.829
No hug is too tight
if you slap the guy's back.

06:10.913 --> 06:12.873
It's "never steal a broad from a friend."

06:12.873 --> 06:15.834
Never let them grow a mustache
unless they're a first responder.

06:15.918 --> 06:18.879
Okay, that is some high horse
you're on there, Dad.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.423
Accusing Phil
of dropping the parenting ball?

06:21.507 --> 06:24.259
- Here we go.
- Name two of my friends growing up.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.303
The mean one and the heavy one.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.014
Hey, just a heads-up. Manny's here.
Oh, no.

06:29.223 --> 06:32.184
What?
- That shows how brave he is.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.144
But let's talk about something else.

06:34.228 --> 06:38.148
The last thing he wants
is to make all this a big deal.

06:40.526 --> 06:41.735
Hello, all.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.113
Forgive my somber drapings.

06:45.197 --> 06:49.201
But like Masha in Chekhov's <i>The Seagull,</i>
I am in mourning for my life.

06:50.202 --> 06:52.371
And don't worry, I don't want any trouble.

06:52.371 --> 06:56.333
Today is not about me,
it's about family, our family,

06:56.333 --> 06:58.043
and the deep profound love we share.

06:58.502 --> 06:59.670
Man, that's cheesy.

06:59.670 --> 07:01.380
Maybe, but it's how I feel.

07:01.505 --> 07:05.092
Thank you, Manny,
for reminding us all what's important.

07:05.092 --> 07:08.303
And how this should be
the most memorable Christmas.

07:08.887 --> 07:11.098
Manny, would you care
for a champagne cocktail?

07:11.223 --> 07:13.392
Please. I do love champagne.

07:13.392 --> 07:17.062
And maybe when I turn my back,
Luke can put his tongue all over it.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.441
Mmm-hmm.

07:21.525 --> 07:24.236
Everything hurts.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.781
Luke, I think you should go.

07:27.865 --> 07:30.033
No, he is not going anywhere.

07:30.117 --> 07:33.495
Every family has a bad seed
that needs to be cast out

07:33.579 --> 07:35.956
so that they can find their way back.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.500
I thought that ours was going to be Haley.

07:38.584 --> 07:43.255
But an accidental pregnancy
saved her from a life of degradation.

07:43.255 --> 07:44.548
Aw!

07:44.673 --> 07:46.049
Nobody has to leave.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.468
I can spend one evening
with the people I love

07:48.552 --> 07:51.388
and a shifty lecher who sleeps
in a shower cap filled with mayonnaise.

07:51.388 --> 07:52.806
It gives me my sheen.

07:52.890 --> 07:54.474
And I told you that in confidence,
you hunk.

07:54.558 --> 07:57.978
Okay, knock it off.
It is time for some farm justice.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.189
Back home, when we have two alpha bulls,

08:00.189 --> 08:03.108
we lock them in a pen
and let them fight it out.

08:03.192 --> 08:05.569
This is between Manny and Luke.

08:05.694 --> 08:07.946
Come on, let's go.

08:08.113 --> 08:10.157
Oh, and help yourself
to a gingerbread person.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.326
They're both gluten and gender free.

08:12.326 --> 08:13.535
Aw...

08:14.620 --> 08:15.954
Isn't they a cutie?

08:16.747 --> 08:19.875
Do not come out of this room
until this is settled.

08:19.875 --> 08:22.544
I will tell you what I tell
the bulls, gentlemen.

08:22.669 --> 08:23.837
I love you both,

08:23.921 --> 08:26.590
but don't make me
regret letting you keep your testicles.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.178
Okay, punch me.

08:31.553 --> 08:33.388
I know it sounds crazy, but I think...

08:33.514 --> 08:35.724
Whoa! Amazing.
Ow.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.726
- I can't believe you did that.
- Me, neither.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.520
And it didn't make me feel better,
by the way.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.647
Maybe kick him or jab him in the eye.

08:41.647 --> 08:42.940
Manny, I'm sorry.

08:42.940 --> 08:46.068
I wish it were someone else,
but I really do care about Sherry.

08:46.318 --> 08:49.613
I go to sleep thinking about her.
I wake up thinking about her.

08:49.738 --> 08:52.866
When I see her,
it's like my heart is smiling.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.243
Wow. I didn't think

08:54.243 --> 08:55.827
this house could get any gayer.

08:55.911 --> 08:57.829
Well, I care about her, too.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.373
And I want her to be happy...

09:00.290 --> 09:01.875
So make sure she knows how you feel.

09:01.959 --> 09:04.002
She's the kind of girl
who needs to hear that.

09:04.461 --> 09:05.462
I don't know.

09:05.754 --> 09:08.757
I'm not good at that stuff.
I'm better off just playing it cool.

09:10.509 --> 09:13.053
Can't believe I'm saying this,
but I can help.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.722
I'll talk, you type.

09:15.806 --> 09:17.933
Are being nice to make me feel worser?

09:17.933 --> 09:19.685
Okay, I'll talk and type.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.856
Honey, there you are.
I've been wanting to talk to you...

09:23.856 --> 09:26.984
About the greatest golf shot
you ever made?

09:26.984 --> 09:28.610
- What was that?
- Oh, man.

09:28.694 --> 09:30.404
- Tenth hole at Riviera.
- Mmm-hmm.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.239
- I had a decision to make.
- Yeah.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.449
I could go left
and stay out of trouble, or...

09:34.533 --> 09:35.909
Can't do it. Is Phil calling me?

09:35.993 --> 09:38.370
Listen, before you run,
I have a professional opportunity

09:38.370 --> 09:39.705
- I'd like to...
- I'd love to hear it.

09:39.830 --> 09:41.790
I'm just a little stuffy.
Let me get some air.

09:41.874 --> 09:46.378
Are you aware that there are 15 times
more dogs in the world than Italians?

09:46.378 --> 09:48.797
That feels offensive.
Not sure why. Should we be mingling?

09:48.881 --> 09:50.841
Listen, now I'm not gonna do a big spiel.
Mmm-hmm.

09:50.841 --> 09:52.259
Suffice to say that

09:52.259 --> 09:55.262
science has shown us
that having a well-rested dog

09:55.262 --> 09:57.222
improves our earning potential

09:57.556 --> 10:01.185
- more than attending college.
- Dad? Can we play with my trucks now?

10:01.643 --> 10:03.187
Give me a couple of minutes, buddy, okay?

10:03.187 --> 10:06.648
'Cause I'm talking to the new VP
of Dog Beds By Stella.

10:08.483 --> 10:09.651
Claire?

10:11.695 --> 10:12.738
Claire?

10:13.697 --> 10:16.533
Do you really think that Cam's parents
bought him a first class ticket?

10:16.617 --> 10:19.286
Aren't they poor? Don't they,
like, eat plants and animals

10:19.286 --> 10:20.370
they find in their yard?

10:20.454 --> 10:22.122
They're farmers, yes.

10:22.414 --> 10:25.042
We gotta dig deeper.
Get Cam's phone and check his texts.

10:25.209 --> 10:26.627
That's an invasion of his privacy.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.295
Plus, I don't even know his passcode.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.630
I just need his face.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.965
I break into Dylan's phone
all the time while he's sleeping.

10:32.049 --> 10:34.760
Not that I need to.
All he does is google water parks.

10:35.052 --> 10:36.136
Ooh.

10:36.220 --> 10:39.556
Uncle Cam, I forgot my phone in my car,

10:39.640 --> 10:42.559
and I wanna take a Boomerang
of me and favorite uncle at his gorgeous

10:42.643 --> 10:44.061
Christmas dinner. Can I use yours?

10:44.061 --> 10:45.938
Well, that's very flattering,
but I'm a little busy with...

10:45.938 --> 10:47.356
Five, six, seven, eight.

10:50.359 --> 10:52.194
It's gonna be huge.
I'm gonna text it to myself.

10:52.194 --> 10:53.612
Okay. Well, thank you.

10:53.612 --> 10:54.988
We're in. Bring the wine.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.032
Ooh, do Lily next.
I'm worried she's vaping.

10:57.366 --> 10:59.618
Dad, what are you doing
over here by yourself?

10:59.618 --> 11:01.370
- Are you okay?
- Oh, I'm...

11:01.370 --> 11:04.706
I'm worried this Luke and Manny thing
will affect me and Gloria at work.

11:04.790 --> 11:06.750
We've been having such a great time.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.877
I call us <i>"chica</i> and the man."

11:12.381 --> 11:14.174
Dad, I have to tell you something.

11:14.258 --> 11:15.759
- Tell him what?
- How?

11:15.884 --> 11:19.221
Hey, everybody.
Look who's friends again. That's right.

11:19.221 --> 11:21.473
Luke's gonna date Sherry. Manny's okay.

11:21.557 --> 11:24.017
Problem solved farm style.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.436
Sorry about that.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.856
Back home when someone would yell
"farm style" we'd all moo together.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.065
It's a sign of good breeding.

11:30.065 --> 11:32.776
Anyway, come. Sit. Let's go. Sit down.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.946
How do you call yourself Colombian

11:35.946 --> 11:39.283
after letting that skunk
off the hook so easily?

11:39.283 --> 11:42.077
Tell me at least that you have
one of his toes in your pocket.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.663
Come on now, Gloria. This is good news.

11:44.663 --> 11:46.915
Disloyalty being rewarded?

11:46.999 --> 11:49.084
Disloyalty, really?

11:49.168 --> 11:52.045
Dad, I caught Gloria interviewing
for a job with another realtor.

11:52.129 --> 11:53.255
What?

11:53.547 --> 11:55.549
<i>Chica!</i> How could you?

11:56.175 --> 12:00.095
There she is. The woman that threw
herself out the window to avoid me.

12:00.179 --> 12:01.263
No. Dad, don't be silly.

12:01.263 --> 12:03.015
- I... I fell.
- No, honey.

12:03.015 --> 12:04.725
I get it. You don't wanna
come and work for me.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.018
And I think I know why.

12:06.018 --> 12:07.728
Dad, I'm sorry. No.

12:07.728 --> 12:12.816
You don't wanna let me down again
like with that whole EzraVision fiasco.

12:12.900 --> 12:13.942
What?

12:15.319 --> 12:18.530
Insensitive, old white men.
What would Christmas be without one?

12:18.614 --> 12:21.575
We seem to have insensitive
people of all ethnicities.

12:21.575 --> 12:22.868
Was that a shot at me?

12:22.868 --> 12:26.163
I've been good. You can't believe
the stuff I haven't said today.

12:26.163 --> 12:29.082
Cam, what's up with your trip home?
Your parents aren't even there.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.419
"Merry Christmas, not happy holidays.
From Galveston."

12:32.503 --> 12:35.339
Okay, how are you
snooping through my phone?

12:35.506 --> 12:37.341
You. That was a false Boomerang?

12:37.341 --> 12:39.468
Look, you know what? Forget it. Forgiven.

12:39.468 --> 12:42.221
I just want today
to be a special Christmas.

12:42.221 --> 12:43.889
Now, please, everyone, sit down.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.349
We'll grab hands, say grace,

12:45.349 --> 12:47.309
have a lovely meal. Okay.

12:47.309 --> 12:49.686
Grab the person to your left and right.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.481
- Dear Lord...
- I knew you were still pissed

12:52.481 --> 12:53.774
about that EzraVision thing.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.359
Claire, we are praying.
Mmm-hmm.

12:55.484 --> 12:56.777
Thank you for this food...

12:56.777 --> 12:59.738
You signed off on that whole deal, buddy.

12:59.738 --> 13:02.407
And I am not afraid of disappointing you.

13:02.491 --> 13:05.202
...and for our family
as we rise above petty grievances.

13:05.202 --> 13:07.996
It's because novelty dog beds are stupid.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.499
Dogs don't care
if they're sleeping in a pineapple.

13:10.499 --> 13:12.918
The Pina Colassie got four woofs on Welp.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.336
That just makes you sound like some...

13:14.336 --> 13:16.839
Please, Lord,
help us not use terms like "imbecile"

13:16.839 --> 13:18.382
or "senile old man."

13:18.382 --> 13:20.926
This is the thanks I get for getting you
back into the work place.

13:20.926 --> 13:23.720
Nice line, Jay.
I could say the same thing to your wife.

13:23.804 --> 13:26.223
I can't believe that you ratted me out.

13:26.223 --> 13:28.392
I'm not afraid of you.
With everyone else around.

13:28.392 --> 13:29.726
Okay. That's enough.

13:30.102 --> 13:32.062
I can't believe you all
couldn't hold it together

13:32.062 --> 13:34.481
for one meal and not argue.

13:34.565 --> 13:36.859
Cam, this is what
we always do on the holidays.

13:36.859 --> 13:38.151
What's the big deal?

13:38.235 --> 13:41.238
The big deal is that this could
be our last Christmas together.

13:42.823 --> 13:43.824
What?
You're being so dramatic.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.450
Oh, my God. You're dying?

13:45.534 --> 13:47.160
No, I'm not dying. It's something else.

13:53.709 --> 13:55.127
Is he pausing to be dramatic?

13:55.586 --> 13:56.753
What do you think?

14:04.761 --> 14:06.722
- Will you...
- It all started last fall.

14:06.722 --> 14:09.141
A scout came to one of my games
and liked what he saw.

14:09.141 --> 14:12.686
And now, I'm one of two
finalists for the head coaching position

14:13.270 --> 14:15.272
at the University
of North Central Missouri.

14:15.439 --> 14:16.481
What?

14:16.565 --> 14:17.608
Wow.

14:17.608 --> 14:18.734
Yeah, that's a big deal.

14:19.026 --> 14:21.486
Yeah, they're flying me out
to meet the athletic director,

14:21.570 --> 14:22.779
and if all goes well...

14:23.906 --> 14:25.032
I could start this spring.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.284
Why didn't you just tell me?

14:27.409 --> 14:30.287
'Cause I didn't wanna
stress you out until it was real.

14:30.579 --> 14:31.705
So...

14:31.705 --> 14:33.874
Wait, would you guys really move?

14:33.999 --> 14:36.084
Mitchell's not moving to Missouri.
What would he do for work?

14:36.168 --> 14:37.711
Prosecute Otis, the town drunk?

14:37.711 --> 14:38.962
Excuse me, it's not Mayberry.

14:39.046 --> 14:42.591
And I'll have you know,
our town ne'er-do-well is a female,

14:42.591 --> 14:44.635
who's addicted to prescription
nasal spray, so...

14:44.635 --> 14:47.095
Okay, and just for the record, I...

14:47.804 --> 14:49.139
- I would go.
- Oh...

14:49.306 --> 14:51.600
I mean, it's only fair.
Cam's been here forever.

14:52.434 --> 14:53.602
I don't like this.

14:53.894 --> 14:54.937
I know, you guys,

14:54.937 --> 14:57.189
but this is an incredible
opportunity for him.

14:57.189 --> 14:59.733
- How could I say no?
- You guys can't go.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.902
I don't want my babies
growing up without you.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.029
They're never gonna believe my stories.

15:04.029 --> 15:06.532
See, this is why I kept it a secret.

15:06.782 --> 15:08.659
Here, I was worried
about you all ruining Christmas,

15:08.659 --> 15:10.994
and now I've done it.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.538
I'm sorry, everyone.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.248
You have no reason to be sorry.

15:14.248 --> 15:16.875
Yes, I do. I break up families.
I'm Liz Taylor.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.168
Why is it never a man?

15:18.544 --> 15:19.545
For what it's worth,

15:19.545 --> 15:21.421
Uncle Cam,
my company has an office in New York,

15:21.505 --> 15:25.217
and I said I'd be open to transferring,
so I could easily break up the family.

15:25.217 --> 15:27.135
You... You never mentioned this to us.

15:27.219 --> 15:28.762
Yeah, and I told NERP that

15:28.846 --> 15:31.014
I would be open
to working at the Paris office.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.099
I mean, Dylan and I have

15:32.099 --> 15:33.600
always wanted to live there.

15:33.684 --> 15:36.061
Wait, you'd take the babies to France?

15:36.270 --> 15:38.397
We... We've talked about it.

15:38.397 --> 15:40.607
Sorry, I get nervous
when you're all looking at me.

15:42.568 --> 15:45.946
And I applied to the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Arts in London.

15:45.946 --> 15:48.615
- I could end up there.
- Yeah, that's a real possibility.

15:48.866 --> 15:51.994
Listen, if everyone's taking off,
maybe we buy that house in Palm Springs,

15:51.994 --> 15:53.120
spend a little more time there.

15:53.120 --> 15:58.250
And that means next Christmas would
be me and Phil and some sad little ham?

15:58.250 --> 16:00.544
Oh, wouldn't Joe go
with Grandpa and Gloria?

16:01.837 --> 16:04.298
Sorry, sweetie.
I'm just drunk and upset.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.091
This got sad.

16:06.675 --> 16:08.552
- Right. Well, no one's leaving now.
- Yeah.

16:08.552 --> 16:11.096
So let's just enjoy each other
while we still can. Right?

16:11.180 --> 16:13.098
- Yes. Help me with the salads, Mitch.
- Yes.

16:13.182 --> 16:14.808
Yes, we'll be right back.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.603
Up until the top.
Mmm-hmm. Mmm.

16:17.603 --> 16:19.062
Yeah, we're gonna stop.

16:20.898 --> 16:22.566
- Hey.
- Phil.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.278
I took that interview because I love you,

16:26.278 --> 16:29.072
and I don't want
to screw up our relationship.

16:29.156 --> 16:32.159
I don't wanna end up
like Claire and Jay.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.578
Please. You and I have been doing great.

16:34.578 --> 16:37.623
Because I hold back.
I have strong opinions

16:37.623 --> 16:40.334
that I don't tell you
because I want to get along.

16:40.334 --> 16:43.128
Like what? You can tell me anything.

16:43.253 --> 16:47.049
Like that bus bench sign.
I think it's goofy.

16:47.049 --> 16:51.386
If we have 20-20 vision,
why are we wearing glasses?

16:52.095 --> 16:54.389
I get it. I just wanted bring
a little joy to our country

16:54.473 --> 16:56.016
in this tumultuous time,
but you're not from here,

16:56.016 --> 16:57.434
so maybe it doesn't matter as much to you.

16:57.518 --> 16:58.602
You see?

16:59.061 --> 17:00.145
Yes.

17:00.479 --> 17:02.022
Yes, I'm sensitive.

17:02.981 --> 17:04.483
But I need this.

17:05.108 --> 17:08.320
New ideas. Someone...
Someone to push up against me.

17:08.320 --> 17:10.989
And honestly,
I can't think of anyone I'd rather have

17:11.073 --> 17:12.699
pushing up against me than you.

17:12.783 --> 17:14.326
<i>Ay,</i> Phil, it's been years.

17:14.326 --> 17:16.995
I can't pretend that I don't
hear those any more.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.163
Hear what?

17:19.331 --> 17:21.375
Yeah, you're right.

17:21.375 --> 17:25.087
I did sign off on that whole
EzraVision thing.

17:25.087 --> 17:26.255
- Mmm-hmm.
- It's not your fault.

17:27.339 --> 17:32.553
Well, I, uh, might be a little defensive
because I feel responsible.

17:33.262 --> 17:34.513
And dog beds aren't...

17:34.513 --> 17:35.597
They're not stupid.

17:35.681 --> 17:38.225
People are happy
when their dogs are happy, right?

17:38.225 --> 17:40.978
Mmm. I'm definitely saving lives,
but I mean, they're not

17:41.603 --> 17:43.397
exactly flying off the shelf.

17:43.397 --> 17:45.649
You're trying to bring me
aboard a sinking ship?

17:45.649 --> 17:49.486
Oh, I was bringing you aboard to save it.
Or even if you couldn't, I...

17:51.113 --> 17:52.823
I just missed working together.

17:53.323 --> 17:55.951
I feel it gave me
a second chance with you.

17:57.828 --> 18:01.039
It did. It did, Dad. And we're good now.

18:01.623 --> 18:02.916
So it's time for me to go

18:03.000 --> 18:05.085
and prove myself on my own.

18:05.377 --> 18:06.378
You hear that?

18:07.004 --> 18:09.256
Ten seconds ago that was you.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.550
I gotta make sure he and I
don't need a second chance.

18:11.550 --> 18:14.720
Yeah. Well, watch out.
Pretty soon he's gonna be working for you.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.180
You know, I don't know
if he has the head for it.

18:16.180 --> 18:17.931
He pitched a dog bed the other day

18:18.015 --> 18:19.391
- in the shape of a cat.
- Mmm.

18:19.641 --> 18:23.353
I mean, who wants to sleep in your enemy?
I would be like me napping in Jon Voight.

18:24.563 --> 18:25.939
- I told you that story...
- Yeah.

18:26.857 --> 18:29.109
Look at that.
You got what you wanted for Christmas.

18:29.193 --> 18:30.360
Yes, and can I just say,

18:30.444 --> 18:33.280
everyone is exactly
where I put them in the first place.

18:37.576 --> 18:41.079
<i>What is it about the holidays
that makes us so emotional?</i>

18:42.873 --> 18:44.791
<i>Is it watching our kids grow up?</i>

18:45.167 --> 18:46.335
Who's gonna get it?

18:47.044 --> 18:49.254
Oh...
- Yay.

18:49.630 --> 18:52.049
<i>Is it how we put our
disagreements aside?</i>

18:52.216 --> 18:53.550
What if, instead,

18:53.634 --> 18:58.305
I am Cher, you're Sonny,
and it says, "We've got you, babe."

18:58.430 --> 19:00.557
Gloria, I don't know how to say this,

19:00.641 --> 19:05.521
but that is the freshest damn
idea I have ever heard.

19:05.521 --> 19:06.897
I love it!

19:06.897 --> 19:10.317
<i>Is it just being with people
you can't imagine life without?</i>

19:10.901 --> 19:14.530
Oh, look, sweetie. It says that this
Missouri town has a lively art scene.

19:14.530 --> 19:16.698
It says "ark scene."

19:16.782 --> 19:19.576
They're preparing
for the Lord's next flood?

19:19.660 --> 19:21.745
Oh! Fun.

19:21.745 --> 19:23.705
- Or is it...
- Enough!

19:23.789 --> 19:25.832
Can we just take this picture already?

19:25.916 --> 19:29.211
Excuse me for wanting
to cherish you all as long as I can.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.879
You don't even have the job yet.

19:30.963 --> 19:33.924
All right, the timer is set, everyone.
We have 15 seconds.

19:34.049 --> 19:35.467
Let's go, everybody. Hurry up.

19:35.551 --> 19:37.803
Oh, my God.
Sherry broke up with me.

19:37.803 --> 19:39.012
Oh...

19:39.096 --> 19:41.223
After I texted her all those nice things
you told me to say to her.

19:41.223 --> 19:44.852
Oh, yeah, that's right.
She hates it when guys move too fast.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.979
Oh well, better to have loved and lost.

19:46.979 --> 19:48.897
There's my Colombian boy.

19:48.981 --> 19:50.274
You son of a...
No!

19:54.653 --> 19:56.280
Hey, I'm back!

19:56.280 --> 19:57.573
Hi.

19:57.573 --> 19:59.491
So, have you heard anything
about the job yet?

19:59.575 --> 20:00.701
No, not yet.

20:00.701 --> 20:03.704
And I may not for a couple months,
but it's out of my control.

20:03.704 --> 20:05.873
And I'm just... I'm letting go.

20:06.123 --> 20:09.084
This is killing me!
Our whole future hangs in the balance

20:09.168 --> 20:11.628
and these people, they don't care!
They don't care!

20:11.879 --> 20:14.715
I'm better now.
Whatever happens, happens.

20:14.715 --> 20:17.092
Give me my damn phone!
I'm gonna call the sadists

20:17.176 --> 20:19.344
and I'm gonna ask them why they hate me!

20:19.845 --> 20:23.307
You know what? Screw them.
I love what we have.

20:25.309 --> 20:27.561
Mmm. I'm so blessed.

20:28.228 --> 20:32.107
It's like, no matter what I do,
I'm always gonna have a B-plus life.

20:32.191 --> 20:33.400
Never an A.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.736
And happy new year to you, too.
