00:07.173 --> 00:09.592
I'm not here to tell you
that you're not gonna fight.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.806
See,
there is gonna come a time,

00:14.889 --> 00:16.099
every single one of you,

00:16.182 --> 00:18.601
you are all gonna have to fight
to control your post.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.769
It's gonna happen.

00:20.895 --> 00:22.313
All the talk in the world,

00:22.397 --> 00:24.691
all that authority you think
you have, that just...

00:24.774 --> 00:26.526
...that goes out the window

00:26.609 --> 00:28.403
when some cat out there
wants to try it.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.748
And here's the thing.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.208
When you have to fight...

00:43.376 --> 00:44.586
man, you gotta win.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.550
There's people who think
that police brutality

00:50.633 --> 00:53.970
-is when police win fights.

00:54.053 --> 00:55.346
But last time I checked,

00:55.430 --> 00:57.223
aren't we supposed
to win the fights?

00:57.974 --> 00:59.309
So, if we're in a fight,

00:59.392 --> 01:01.561
fuck any talk
of police brutality.

01:05.523 --> 01:06.524
Check it.

01:09.444 --> 01:12.697
If we lose the fights,
we lose the streets.

01:16.409 --> 01:17.577
Let that sink in.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.790
But I'm not here
to talk to you about the fights

01:21.873 --> 01:24.417
that you have to have.
See, I'm here to, uh...

01:24.501 --> 01:26.961
I'm here to talk to you
about the ones you--

01:27.045 --> 01:28.713
that you wanna have.

01:28.797 --> 01:31.716
And ones you...
you think you're entitled to,

01:31.800 --> 01:33.301
just because you're wearing
a badge.

01:33.384 --> 01:36.346
See, that,
that's the real brutality.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.515
The thing is you don't need
that kind of brutality.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.475
And, hey,
not 'cause it's not fun.

01:41.184 --> 01:42.519
Right? I get it.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.687
Get a few licks in
on some mouthy asshole

01:44.771 --> 01:45.980
who just can't shut the fuck up.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.358
I mean, come on.
Fun is fun, right? Yeah.

01:49.692 --> 01:52.028
But see,
that kind of brutality just--

01:52.111 --> 01:54.280
it only gets in the way
of doing the job.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.740
-First off...

01:55.824 --> 01:58.159
...no one's gonna talk
to you if you're beating on 'em.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.831
I mean, no one is gonna tell you
what you need to know.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.707
And here's the thing.
If you really wanna kick ass

02:04.791 --> 02:07.001
out on those streets,
it's information.

02:07.085 --> 02:09.087
-- There it is.
-- Find out who's who.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.755
No, it ain't!
That ain't mine.

02:10.839 --> 02:13.424
Who does what dirt,
where do they do it?

02:13.508 --> 02:15.552
Who is it that they do
that dirt with?

02:15.635 --> 02:17.637
Information.
That's what will get you cases.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.139
-That's what will get you guns
and drugs.
-I don't know, man.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.724
So, you can think
you're the baddest dude

02:21.808 --> 02:22.892
behind a badge,

02:22.976 --> 02:25.228
Baltimore City badass,
you're beating on people,

02:25.311 --> 02:26.563
but by the time
you walk into court,

02:26.646 --> 02:28.606
-what are you walking in with?
-Lift your hands!

02:28.690 --> 02:30.525
A bunch of failures to yield?

02:30.608 --> 02:32.527
Disorderlies,
some ticky-tack nonsense?

02:32.610 --> 02:34.362
You got nothing that's gonna
make a state attorney

02:34.445 --> 02:36.865
sign your court slip.
So, what are you doing?

02:36.948 --> 02:38.575
You're getting paid
to sit on a bench

02:38.658 --> 02:40.034
-in a hallway...

02:40.118 --> 02:41.494
...outside Wabash
for a few hours

02:41.578 --> 02:43.162
for a case that's only gonna
get dismissed?

02:43.246 --> 02:44.455
You will exit
on the right.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.124
Truth is, man,
you ain't doing jack

02:46.207 --> 02:48.251
by being brutal.
See, you ain't getting guns.

02:48.334 --> 02:49.419
You ain't getting drugs.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.796
You ain't getting those big,
hairy, balls-out cases,

02:51.880 --> 02:55.008
the ones that'll get you paid,
get you promoted.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.847
Here's the other thing about,
uh, being brutal.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.765
Get the fuck off me, yo.
I ain't do something.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.351
Not only does it get in the way
of doing the job,

03:05.435 --> 03:08.354
but I'ma tell you right now,
when you beat on people,

03:08.438 --> 03:10.815
-you will get IAD complaints.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.734
You'll get files.
You get enough complaints,

03:12.817 --> 03:14.652
you get a reputation.
Maybe even transferred

03:14.736 --> 03:16.279
out of your unit.
And even if you can write

03:16.362 --> 03:18.448
your way out of the hassle,
and most police worth a shit,

03:18.531 --> 03:19.699
well, they can write
their way out

03:19.782 --> 03:21.284
-of pretty much anything.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.661
I'm telling you,
it just gets you
the kind of attention

03:23.745 --> 03:25.580
that only makes it harder
to do the job.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.248
And I've heard it all before.
"No, Sarge,

03:27.332 --> 03:28.374
I never got charged for that.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.460
We never even went
in front of a trial board."

03:30.543 --> 03:32.295
But then a month, two months
down the road,

03:32.378 --> 03:33.963
a civil suit comes behind you.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.174
City's gotta pay money for you.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.301
You get a reputation for that,
then you get pulled off

03:38.384 --> 03:41.304
the street. Then what good
are you to anyone?

03:41.387 --> 03:44.098
Look, bottom line,
if beating on people made cases,

03:44.182 --> 03:46.434
shit, I'd tell you, go on
out there, kick everybody's ass.

03:46.517 --> 03:48.478
But you know what?
It just don't work like that.

03:48.561 --> 03:49.812
So, if that's the kind of work

03:49.896 --> 03:51.272
you wanna do,
I'ma tell you right now,

03:51.356 --> 03:53.274
you're not coming anywhere
near my unit.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.402
Gun Trace Task Force,
we are not about that bullshit.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.363
So, what am I saying?

03:58.446 --> 04:00.448
When you leave here tonight,
are you gonna say,

04:00.531 --> 04:02.200
"Man, was Wayne Jenkins up here

04:02.283 --> 04:04.661
telling me that we can't fight
if we have to fight?

04:04.744 --> 04:05.954
Wayne Jenkins,
he was telling us

04:06.037 --> 04:07.288
that we can't control our post

04:07.372 --> 04:08.581
if we have to control
our post."

04:08.665 --> 04:10.541
Man, I'm telling you,
you better control your post.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.210
"But Wayne Jenkins,
he was telling us

04:12.293 --> 04:14.128
that our hands are tied?"

04:14.212 --> 04:17.173
Your hands are not fucking tied.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.716
-Get this.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.010
Police officer on the street,
if he knows the law.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.637
-Fuck you!
-If he knows

04:22.720 --> 04:24.138
how to use the law,

04:24.222 --> 04:25.181
if he can write a report,

04:25.264 --> 04:26.516
if he can make
that report read clean,

04:26.599 --> 04:28.434
if he understands
his own authority,

04:28.518 --> 04:30.186
he wins.
And that's not sometimes.

04:30.269 --> 04:33.064
That's every time.
That is every fucking time.

04:33.147 --> 04:35.358
And no matter what you're doing
out there in those streets,

04:35.441 --> 04:38.236
by the time you walk
into any courtroom in this city,

04:38.319 --> 04:39.904
your word prevails.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.115
And if you're getting
good cases,

04:42.198 --> 04:43.825
if you're getting
drugs and guns,

04:43.908 --> 04:45.660
you're bringing in shooters,
shit.

04:51.207 --> 04:52.792
Man, you can't lose.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.296
Now, go out there
and give them hell.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.342
Dang!

06:38.272 --> 06:39.482
-Back up!
-Back up!

06:42.485 --> 06:44.278
Baltimore is a poster child

06:44.362 --> 06:47.323
for the basic failure
to stop lawlessness.

06:48.032 --> 06:49.867
No justice, no peace!

06:49.951 --> 06:52.537
I have heard your calls
for no justice, no peace...

06:52.620 --> 06:54.288
No justice, no peace!

07:22.817 --> 07:25.153
Where there's
smoke, there's fire.

07:25.236 --> 07:28.823
These officers,
they're 1930s-style gangsters.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.501
So, just so I don't keep

07:40.585 --> 07:42.253
misspelling it...

07:42.336 --> 07:45.173
uh, give me your correct
first name.

07:45.256 --> 07:50.219
-My correct first name? Momodu.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.516
M-O-M-O-D-U.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.019
-Just like it sounds.
-Just call me G-Money.

08:01.272 --> 08:04.066
Tell us about Wayne Jenkins.

08:04.150 --> 08:09.071
Wayne Jenkins?
That cop is fucking crazy.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.033
No, he's off the hook, P.

08:12.116 --> 08:13.367
But he understands something

08:13.451 --> 08:16.204
the way the rest
of you fucking people do not.

08:16.287 --> 08:19.081
And what you know is everything.
You understand me?

08:23.127 --> 08:25.421
It's elementary shit.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.842
If you're on the inside
of everything,

08:29.926 --> 08:33.137
if people are talking to you
and you're talking to them,

08:33.221 --> 08:36.057
then you're a step ahead
of everybody.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.351
Now, this drug game
is about information.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.811
Who got it, who gets it.

08:42.563 --> 08:43.522
You dig?

08:48.694 --> 08:49.779
Yeah, she got it.

08:53.157 --> 08:54.200
Come on, Jenkins.

08:54.283 --> 08:55.701
-While we're young.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.245
Will you hold
the fuck on, man?

08:57.328 --> 08:59.205
Let's get
this shit done, man.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.336
What the fuck
are we waiting for?

09:05.419 --> 09:07.838
I just like it when your panties
get all up in a bunch, Marcus.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.799
You know that shit
makes me happy.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.050
-You ready?
-Yes.

09:11.133 --> 09:12.802
-I feel like he's ready, y'all.
-Shit, man.

09:12.885 --> 09:15.846
Aw. Fuck it.
All right. Let's go.

09:34.198 --> 09:35.408
BPD.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.454
-Motherfucker! Police.
-Get the fuck out.

09:40.538 --> 09:41.622
-Get out of here.
-Shit!

09:41.706 --> 09:42.957
-- Police!
-- Get your hands up.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.417
-Get on the floor!
-Get down, now!

09:44.500 --> 09:46.419
What'd I just say?
Get on the fucking ground.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.548
What part of "on the ground"
don't you understand, dumb-dumb?

09:50.631 --> 09:51.799
What the fuck I just say?

09:51.882 --> 09:54.093
Let's go.
Anybody on the second floor?

09:54.176 --> 09:56.137
-Your mother is.
-Anybody on the second floor?

09:56.220 --> 09:57.847
Hey, get off
the couch, man.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.391
And shut that shit off,
motherfucker. Let's go!

10:00.474 --> 10:02.893
Hey, man, you good?
Is there anyone upstairs?

10:02.977 --> 10:03.978
Answer the question.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.062
-Anyone upstairs?
-Nah.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.397
All right. Let's go.
Cuff him up.

10:06.480 --> 10:07.481
Hey, gun.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.233
Now, you're talking.
Okay. Now, we eating.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.193
Go ahead and bag those.
You on me.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.653
All right, we're up.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.238
-Yeah.
-Baltimore Police!

10:14.322 --> 10:15.781
Let's go.
Who's upstairs?

10:15.865 --> 10:17.241
Get the fuck
outta here with that.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.409
Baltimore Police,
search warrant.

10:18.492 --> 10:20.536
Fine, all right.
We'll talk.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.079
I got the door on the left.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.789
No. No. Leave that one.
That's mine.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.791
64-52 to Dispatch, need a wagon

10:25.875 --> 10:28.461
on Collingwood Square.
Make that a 10-15.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.130
Keep moving.

10:33.632 --> 10:36.052
-Oh, we got it, Sarge.
-All righty.

10:36.927 --> 10:37.970
Okay.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.894
Let's go.
Search that closet right there.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.937
-Yeah.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.149
Dag, boy.

10:50.232 --> 10:51.650
Right where your man said.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.780
-Big fucking Wayne.
-Oh, Hendrix.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.698
I think I'm getting
an erection, man.

10:58.866 --> 10:59.867
Big fucking Wayne.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.369
That's what I'm fucking
talking about.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.120
-You my man.
-This shit ain't stopping.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.456
Check it out. Go through that.
Where's that at?

11:05.539 --> 11:07.458
-Oh, my God.

11:07.541 --> 11:09.460
Oh, shit.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.589
What you got, Wayne?

11:19.595 --> 11:21.263
Wayne, what you looking at?

11:21.347 --> 11:22.556
Let's go, let's go.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.267
-Thanks. I'll stop by today.

11:25.351 --> 11:29.355
What's going on,
Detective Suiter? Okay. Okay.

11:30.564 --> 11:32.274
Wayne. Hendrix.

11:33.776 --> 11:34.944
Hey, man,
do me a favor.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.987
Just, go ahead, and go down,
and get in line at ECU,

11:37.071 --> 11:39.281
-I'll meet you down there.
-All right. Good to talk.

11:39.824 --> 11:40.908
Look at you, man.

11:40.991 --> 11:43.577
Up in this homicide division
with your fancy ass.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.454
I remember when we were both
fresh to the VCID.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.123
-Look at us now.
-Man, time flies,

11:47.206 --> 11:48.416
and all that bullshit.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.376
In two years, I'll have my 20,

11:50.459 --> 11:51.710
-and then I'm gone.
-Mm.

11:51.794 --> 11:52.962
-What about you?

11:53.045 --> 11:55.965
Man, I love me some me.
Retire? No fucking way.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.716
I was born to do this shit.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.469
-What do you got there?
-That's a jackpot, Sean.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.637
Swear to God, man.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.639
We raided a stash house
over on the Eastside.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.307
Man, these shitbirds,
they got enough artillery,

12:05.391 --> 12:07.435
it's like they was trying
to start a war or some shit.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.895
I got 380s,
9 millimeters, shotgun.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.605
I'll run this shit
through Ballistics, man.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.023
I know you guys got, what?

12:13.107 --> 12:14.191
A half-dozen fresh bodies

12:14.275 --> 12:15.776
over the Eastern
the last two weeks?

12:15.860 --> 12:17.611
So, I thought I'd swoop
through, you know?

12:17.695 --> 12:19.155
Solve a crime or two.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.448
And if we do,

12:20.531 --> 12:23.242
I come at you with the info
on the crew we bagged.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.286
Another feather in your cap,
Wayne.

12:25.369 --> 12:27.288
I'll see you around, hotshot.

12:31.709 --> 12:34.253
How long had you known
Antonio Shropshire,

12:34.336 --> 12:35.588
a.k.a. "Brill,"

12:35.671 --> 12:38.132
before you got involved
in his drug operation?

12:39.550 --> 12:42.052
I've been knowing Brill
about five years.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.054
You grew up
in the same, uh, neighborhood?

12:44.722 --> 12:45.890
Thereabouts.

12:45.973 --> 12:47.725
And in your recollection,

12:47.808 --> 12:50.186
when did you first
start doing robberies?

12:50.269 --> 12:51.353
Was it before or after

12:51.437 --> 12:52.897
you got involved
with Shropshire?

12:52.980 --> 12:54.315
Before.

12:54.398 --> 12:57.318
It had to be around 2008 or so.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.821
But-- Yo, it...

13:00.905 --> 13:02.823
It wasn't, like,
armed robbery.

13:02.907 --> 13:06.619
I mean, I was just leaning
into some people.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.913
-You did that where?
-All over.

13:08.996 --> 13:11.624
Was Belvedere Towers
on Northern Parkway

13:11.707 --> 13:12.958
a hot spot for you?

13:14.502 --> 13:15.503
Yeah.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.588
The BT.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.217
I did a lot of business
up there.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.178
All right.
So, tell me something.

13:24.261 --> 13:26.347
How you all get
onto all this shit?

13:29.642 --> 13:32.394
-We ask the questions.
-I'm just curious. I mean...

13:33.312 --> 13:35.272
what brought you all into us?

13:35.356 --> 13:37.233
I'm just trying
to peep the game.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.735
Long story.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.445
Lot of twists.

13:42.947 --> 13:43.989
No doubt.

13:47.618 --> 13:48.661
No doubt.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.416
Gonna be 10-8, too.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.543
We're finishing up here.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.336
MD will be transporting
the body.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.256
Copy on the 10-8.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.640
-- Who pronounced it?
-- Kenneth, yeah.

14:14.562 --> 14:15.646
Ashley?

14:15.729 --> 14:17.898
She was gone
when the EMTs arrived.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.902
They were able to revive you
with a shot.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.738
Oh, fuck.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.449
-Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Yeah, it's all back here.

14:27.533 --> 14:31.662
-What was she to you?
-S-- she was my friend. I-- I...

14:31.745 --> 14:36.083
-I-- I met her at rehab.
-Rehab, huh?

14:36.166 --> 14:38.419
She called me
out of the blue today.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.296
Sh-- she'd been doing
coke and ecstasy,

14:40.379 --> 14:42.673
and she wanted some heroin.

14:42.756 --> 14:45.801
-You guys had sex tonight?
-Yeah. Yeah. We had sex.

14:45.884 --> 14:47.303
-Consensual sex?
-Yes.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.762
It was consensual sex.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.306
All right. 'Cause I checked
on your phone,

14:50.389 --> 14:52.474
and looks like you snapped
a couple nudes of her

14:52.558 --> 14:54.810
-while she was sleeping?
-That was just a joke, man.

14:54.893 --> 14:57.896
I-- I was gonna show her those
when she woke up.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.189
-Okay.

15:00.691 --> 15:03.193
It was her that called 911,
if that's any consolation.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.112
She probably saved your life.

15:05.195 --> 15:06.447
If you're gonna keep doing
this stuff,

15:06.530 --> 15:07.781
make sure you keep some
Narcan around.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.199
Where'd this come from?

15:10.576 --> 15:12.661
-The city.
-Be more specific.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.331
There's other Bumblebees
like this in your bedroom.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.457
That tells us that you cop

15:16.540 --> 15:18.917
from the same guy
on the regular. Who is he?

15:19.501 --> 15:20.669
Goes by Black.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.505
That doesn't really narrow it
down that much.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.966
His name is Anderson, okay?
That's all I know.

15:26.925 --> 15:28.927
I roll into the city,
and I roll out.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.220
And I don't even
get out of my car.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.555
But where do you cop?

15:32.973 --> 15:35.851
At the Alameda.
It's that strip up--

15:35.934 --> 15:38.020
next to the chicken-box place.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.813
Just "Anderson"? No other name?

15:39.897 --> 15:42.358
All I got other than Black.

15:43.609 --> 15:44.652
Fuck.

15:45.402 --> 15:48.113
Fuck. Oh, God.

15:51.825 --> 15:52.993
Sorry for your loss.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.332
Well, whoever
this Anderson guy is,

15:58.415 --> 15:59.583
he's dealing Shropshire product.

16:01.168 --> 16:04.129
Those Bumblebee bags
are Shropshire's sig.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.715
Man,
this shit is laying people out.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.645
I've seen him--
He ain't doing anything.

16:19.728 --> 16:20.938
Stop fighting!
Stop fighting!

16:21.021 --> 16:22.690
-Back up!

16:22.773 --> 16:23.857
You wanna get hit?

16:23.941 --> 16:25.192
Stop fighting.
You wanna get hit?

16:25.275 --> 16:26.568
Get the fuck off him, man!

16:26.652 --> 16:28.278
Give me your fuckin' hands!

16:28.362 --> 16:31.490
Yeah, go on, nigga.
Beat on him like you gonna do.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.117
We know you wanna.

16:40.457 --> 16:43.252
Give him your arm.
Dude, you're gonna get hurt.

16:45.045 --> 16:47.715
-Give him your fuckin' arm!
-Fuck this. It's not worth it.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.466
Let him go, pig!

16:49.550 --> 16:51.468
-Police yourselves.
-Police yourself, pig!

16:53.679 --> 16:55.472
Take care of your own
fuckin' problems!

16:57.433 --> 16:58.934
Take your dumb ass
to the suburbs!

16:59.017 --> 17:01.645
Yeah! We're goin' viral
on your bitch ass.

17:01.729 --> 17:05.315
I bet your mama's a pig, too.
Yeah, let me get some ribs, hoe!

17:05.399 --> 17:07.443
Get that shit, yo.
Bitch-ass police, man.

17:15.325 --> 17:19.455
"Anderson," hits 1,100 times
in the police computer.

17:19.538 --> 17:23.083
Now, "Anderson" with "Black,"
is still over 100.

17:23.167 --> 17:27.296
But this guy, Aaron Anderson,
grew up near the Alameda.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.299
I printed a photo.

17:30.382 --> 17:33.677
-Anything on the CE?
-One hit for Antonio Shropshire

17:33.761 --> 17:37.306
and a street name of Brill
confirmed in the computer.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.808
Baltimore County
is also working him.

17:39.892 --> 17:40.976
Let me guess.

17:41.059 --> 17:43.312
-Kilpatrick?
-Yeah. No doubt.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.606
That fucking Mick has his hand
in everything.

17:45.689 --> 17:48.692
Hey. Be nice.
The Irish are everywhere.

17:52.529 --> 17:53.989
Hey there. Is Kilpatrick in?

17:54.072 --> 17:55.282
Yes. Who's calling?

17:55.365 --> 17:57.868
McDougall with the Task Force
out of Harford County.

17:57.951 --> 17:59.203
Sure,
one moment, please.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.622
Yeah.
Tell him it's about my bar tab.

18:01.705 --> 18:03.415
That'll get him to the phone.

18:04.082 --> 18:05.501
You a wild dude, man.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.844
Civil Rights Office, Baltimore.

18:18.096 --> 18:19.640
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:19.723 --> 18:21.183
I looked for you at lunch.

18:21.266 --> 18:24.520
Oh, I went for carry-out.
Shore Seafood, Northeast Market.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.272
Heard good things
about their lake trout, so...

18:27.356 --> 18:28.732
Lake trout? Really?

18:28.816 --> 18:30.818
You learn a city by its food,
Charlie.

18:30.901 --> 18:33.111
Nicole,
you should see this.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.866
iPhones are no friend
to the BPD.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.161
On North Avenue.
I was just there.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.371
Hmm.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.872
They do post these quick.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.582
Did you see how it ended?

18:45.666 --> 18:47.167
Ends with the guy on the ground.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.211
Nope. It ends...

18:49.878 --> 18:51.547
when the police ran away.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.591
-What do you mean?
-They just quit the arrest.

18:54.675 --> 18:55.717
Cameras pointing at them

18:55.801 --> 18:57.344
in every direction,
and they just...

18:57.427 --> 18:58.512
cut and ran.

18:58.595 --> 19:01.056
Left that man on the pavement
just like that.

19:01.139 --> 19:02.558
Well, that makes a statement.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.768
Sure does. It says
that after Freddie Gray,

19:04.852 --> 19:06.395
"If we have to police
the right way,

19:06.478 --> 19:07.771
we're not gonna police at all."

19:07.855 --> 19:10.524
Nicole,
I have an acolyte for you.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.359
-An acolyte?
-A follower.

19:12.442 --> 19:13.861
-Ugh.
-A trial attorney.

19:13.944 --> 19:16.154
-Call me Ahmed.
-DOJ sent you?

19:16.238 --> 19:18.532
They did.
I was in Philly, but...

19:18.615 --> 19:19.741
Yeah, I saw enough there

19:19.825 --> 19:20.993
that I asked
if there were openings

19:21.076 --> 19:23.370
in the Civil Rights Office.
And so, here I am.

19:23.453 --> 19:24.913
You better hope
that Hillary wins.

19:24.997 --> 19:25.998
What do you mean?

19:26.081 --> 19:27.416
She means
if the election goes

19:27.499 --> 19:28.917
the wrong way,
you won't have any work

19:29.001 --> 19:29.918
to do for four years.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.712
In any Republican
administration,

19:31.795 --> 19:34.173
the OCR is where good lawyers
come to die.

19:34.256 --> 19:37.217
But there's no way Trump
even gets a nomination.

19:37.301 --> 19:38.427
And no-- no way he can--

19:38.510 --> 19:40.721
-he can win.
-Anyway, welcome to the team.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.639
-You met Charlie, I guess.
-And Bill,

19:42.723 --> 19:44.474
who left for the courthouse
before lunch.

19:44.558 --> 19:47.895
Charlie and Bill supervise
the Patterns and Practices team.

19:47.978 --> 19:50.314
So, this will be your first
consent decree investigation?

19:50.397 --> 19:52.232
Yeah. Washington just...

19:52.316 --> 19:53.567
...tossed me into the deep end.

19:53.650 --> 19:56.570
One minute I'm doing
drug and tax cases, and...

19:56.653 --> 19:58.071
next minute I'm in Baltimore.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.907
Well, it might
be a while before you land

19:59.990 --> 20:02.826
in a courtroom again.
We don't usually litigate.

20:03.201 --> 20:04.578
No?

20:04.661 --> 20:07.289
We hold hands,
and we twist arms.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.042
Wanna meet the mayor?

20:11.418 --> 20:12.461
Absolutely.

20:12.544 --> 20:14.463
Chips?

20:14.546 --> 20:15.881
No. I'm good. Thanks.

20:15.964 --> 20:17.799
-- Come on, have some.
-- Is it impolite?

20:17.883 --> 20:19.551
Crab chips.
They make you feel good.

20:19.635 --> 20:20.844
Tell me about Shropshire.

20:20.928 --> 20:23.305
You know, we've been up on him
for a while now, but...

20:23.388 --> 20:25.891
he's slick. He mostly stays away
from the hot spots.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.225
All right,
so, what about his guys?

20:27.309 --> 20:30.562
-Glen Wells, 'Twan Washington.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.564
You ever come across
a guy named, uh,

20:32.648 --> 20:34.358
Aaron Anderson, goes by Black?

20:35.776 --> 20:38.654
-You're gonna make me work?
-Come on. Look it up for me.

20:39.863 --> 20:41.698
-Take a second out of your day.

20:41.782 --> 20:44.368
-Anderson. Anderson.

20:45.285 --> 20:46.578
Yeah, I got the name.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.374
But I don't have him dealing
the same weight

20:50.457 --> 20:52.292
as Shropshire
or his lieutenants.

20:53.168 --> 20:55.003
He might be with them, or not.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.297
Well, I got four ODs out
in Harford County.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.174
All of them Bumblebee bags.

20:59.257 --> 21:00.300
Latest one last night,

21:00.384 --> 21:02.010
and apparently,
Anderson dealt it.

21:02.928 --> 21:03.971
-Huh.
-Fact is,

21:04.054 --> 21:05.931
I've been tracking
this stuff through the ME.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.516
These fucking Bumblebee bags
have dropped,

21:07.599 --> 21:09.977
like, a dozen people so far.
Uh, six in the city,

21:10.060 --> 21:11.770
three in your county,
one down in Arundel.

21:11.853 --> 21:14.648
See, I got Anderson working out
on the Alameda,

21:14.731 --> 21:17.150
that shopping center they got
below Belvedere.

21:18.068 --> 21:19.152
But...

21:19.236 --> 21:20.946
I don't have a good address
on him.

21:21.029 --> 21:23.031
You know, he stays
with girlfriends mostly.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.533
He drives a Cherokee,

21:24.616 --> 21:26.451
if I remember.
Also in a girl's name.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.495
My last OD copped off
the Alameda.

21:31.581 --> 21:34.292
You know what I'm thinking?
You could set up shop.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.086
Well, I don't wanna step
on your toes.

21:36.169 --> 21:37.587
Shit.

21:38.296 --> 21:40.090
We want the same thing.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.009
It's all coming out
of the city anyway.

21:42.092 --> 21:43.135
It's hard to make a county case

21:43.218 --> 21:45.721
without us all showing up
downtown, right?

21:45.804 --> 21:48.098
All right.
Throw in together on this one?

21:49.599 --> 21:50.976
-Sure.
-Come on.

21:51.893 --> 21:53.603
But...

21:53.687 --> 21:55.856
Harford and Baltimore County
only for now.

21:55.939 --> 21:58.025
-Why is that?
-I've been to the Alameda.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.527
It's an open market,
but you rarely see a bust.

22:00.610 --> 22:04.072
Corner boys there, they see
BPD radio cars cruise by...

22:04.990 --> 22:06.158
they don't even flinch.

22:09.619 --> 22:11.621
We're not gonna make a dent
in this shit, are we?

22:11.705 --> 22:13.123
If I thought about that,
I wouldn't get

22:13.206 --> 22:14.750
out of bed in the morning.

22:17.586 --> 22:18.628
Thank you, brother.

22:52.704 --> 22:55.582
-Here you go.
-A little milk, extra foam?

22:55.665 --> 22:57.834
Double cap
with a dash of vanilla, dry.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.002
I told the barista,

22:59.086 --> 23:00.420
but he told me
to go fuck myself.

23:00.504 --> 23:02.464
-Anything?

23:02.547 --> 23:03.965
Oh. That's terrible.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.635
Yeah.
I-- I might be confused, but...

23:07.803 --> 23:09.679
seems to me there's some
drug-related activity

23:09.763 --> 23:12.140
-going on here tonight.

23:12.224 --> 23:15.143
It's too dark to make out
the players, huh?

23:15.227 --> 23:17.020
Our guy from BG&E will be here
in the morning

23:17.104 --> 23:18.814
to put a camera up
one of the light poles

23:18.897 --> 23:19.773
so we can read the monitor.

23:19.856 --> 23:21.233
You know that lot
across the street?

23:21.316 --> 23:22.317
Mm-hmm.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.777
The guys are parking
their whips there

23:23.860 --> 23:25.987
-before they go to work.
-Good to know.

23:32.744 --> 23:34.454
This is supposed
to be the most important

23:34.538 --> 23:36.748
-meal of the day.
-I think it's dinner.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.667
Yeah.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.377
What do you do for dinner?

23:40.460 --> 23:41.628
I drink it.

23:41.711 --> 23:42.838
You will too

23:42.921 --> 23:45.006
once you see
what this job has to offer.

23:45.090 --> 23:49.553
I'm kidding. I'm kidding,
but just a little bit.

23:49.636 --> 23:50.887
It's that bad, huh?

23:50.971 --> 23:53.473
Ooh.
This is my fourth go-around.

23:53.557 --> 23:56.184
Seattle, Cincinnati,
New Orleans, and now here.

23:56.268 --> 23:59.146
In fact, I got to Baltimore
before Freddie Gray,

23:59.229 --> 24:00.897
with an independent
consulting team

24:00.981 --> 24:03.316
that was requested by the mayor
after the newspaper here

24:03.400 --> 24:07.195
revealed a shit-ton of city
payouts to brutality victims.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.572
So, that was voluntary.

24:08.655 --> 24:11.658
But after Freddie Gray,
the mayor went all-in.

24:11.741 --> 24:14.452
Asked DOJ
for a full-bore investigation

24:14.536 --> 24:16.621
to support a consent decree.

24:16.705 --> 24:19.624
But the truth is,
she didn't have to ask.

24:19.708 --> 24:20.750
After Freddie Gray,

24:20.834 --> 24:22.127
we were coming
whether she asked or not.

24:22.210 --> 24:26.381
Mm. Excess brutality, profiling,
selective prosecution.

24:26.464 --> 24:29.718
In a city of 620,000,

24:29.801 --> 24:32.888
BPD cops reported over 300,000

24:32.971 --> 24:35.307
pedestrian stops
in the last five years.

24:36.474 --> 24:38.435
Right? And of those stops,

24:38.518 --> 24:43.064
less than four percent resulted
in a citation or an arrest.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.400
We have seven Black males

24:45.483 --> 24:48.695
who were each stopped
more than 30 times.

24:48.778 --> 24:50.447
Driving while Black.

24:51.239 --> 24:52.824
Walking while Black.

24:52.908 --> 24:56.411
Same damn bullshit.

24:56.494 --> 24:59.664
-You seem angry.
-Aren't you?

25:01.958 --> 25:03.418
Sure.

25:03.501 --> 25:05.420
But I don't make it
my everything.

25:19.392 --> 25:21.102
Drive-thru windows,
for Christ's sake.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.271
These guys
just don't give a fuck.

25:25.690 --> 25:28.068
I think Anderson
just got out of his ride.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.237
It looks like him anyway.

25:33.615 --> 25:35.951
Late model Cherokee.
That's it, there.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.747
-Can you make out the plates?

25:42.666 --> 25:44.626
-Yeah.
-All right.

25:50.131 --> 25:52.801
I'm not your opponent here,
Ms. Steele. No one is.

25:52.884 --> 25:54.970
We began this process
with you in good faith,

25:55.053 --> 25:58.473
even before Freddie Gray.
And as far as I'm concerned,

25:58.556 --> 26:01.476
everything that can be done
to turn this thing around

26:01.559 --> 26:03.645
needs to happen sooner,
not later.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.064
Thank you for that, Ms. Mayor.

26:06.147 --> 26:07.482
But I asked
for this meeting today

26:07.565 --> 26:10.277
because I wanted some insight
as to why you've asked

26:10.360 --> 26:12.445
the police commissioner
to resign.

26:12.529 --> 26:13.655
Have you seen the crime stats?

26:13.738 --> 26:15.573
Since Freddie Gray,
the city is out of control.

26:15.657 --> 26:18.535
Murders, shootings, robberies,
everything is way up.

26:18.618 --> 26:20.912
And you blame
Commissioner Batts?

26:20.996 --> 26:22.622
See, I have the impression
that a lot

26:22.706 --> 26:25.208
of your rank-and-file officers
are quitting on you.

26:25.292 --> 26:26.459
A work slowdown

26:26.543 --> 26:28.211
is the new commissioner's
worry as well.

26:28.295 --> 26:30.005
Beginning
with Mosby's indictments

26:30.088 --> 26:33.925
in the Freddie Gray case,
arrests have nosedived.

26:34.009 --> 26:35.010
But you asked

26:35.093 --> 26:37.304
why I replaced
Commissioner Batts.

26:37.387 --> 26:38.430
And the honest truth is,

26:38.513 --> 26:40.557
that I began
to lose faith in him,

26:40.640 --> 26:42.392
even before
the crime rate exploded.

26:42.475 --> 26:46.354
In fact, I'd date it to the day
of Freddie Gray's funeral.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.315
Funeral and the rioting
that followed.

26:48.398 --> 26:49.691
-The uprising.
-Uprising. Pardon me.

26:49.774 --> 26:51.484
STEPHANIE RAWLINGS-
Call it what you will.

26:51.568 --> 26:54.195
With the funeral scheduled
and the city on edge,

26:54.279 --> 26:57.866
I called Commissioner Batts
to ask about our preparations.

26:57.949 --> 27:01.286
I reached him
on his way to the airport.

27:01.369 --> 27:03.163
He was taking
a vacation in Greece.

27:03.246 --> 27:05.373
I had to order him back.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.833
Not that he came back
to Baltimore

27:06.916 --> 27:08.835
and turned anything around.

27:08.918 --> 27:11.129
By then, I had people
in the police department

27:11.212 --> 27:13.048
telling me a job action
was underway.

27:13.131 --> 27:15.258
And arrests are still way down
at this moment,

27:15.342 --> 27:17.719
with the crime rate
at an all-time high.

27:17.802 --> 27:19.721
They're mad as hell
about the state's attorney

27:19.804 --> 27:22.766
-charging those officers.
-Reform has a cost.

27:22.849 --> 27:25.143
It does. And if it was going
to be up to me,

27:25.226 --> 27:26.936
I would certainly pay it.

27:27.020 --> 27:29.939
It won't be up to you as mayor?

27:30.023 --> 27:33.526
I've yet to announce this,
Ms. Steele, but...

27:33.610 --> 27:35.487
I won't be running
for reelection.

27:36.363 --> 27:37.572
I'm stepping down.

27:46.623 --> 27:49.709
Oh, wifey's got
a kid in the car.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.252
Man,
I've seen guys roll up here

27:51.336 --> 27:53.254
who look like they work
at T. Rowe Price.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.340
Cars with Hopkins stickers
in the windows.

27:55.423 --> 27:56.925
Heroin's cheaper than oxy.

27:58.301 --> 28:00.220
And we think
that's Anderson's jeep?

28:00.303 --> 28:01.679
We do,
but he rolled out,

28:01.763 --> 28:03.223
and we don't know
when he's coming back.

28:04.015 --> 28:06.601
Well... patience then.

28:07.143 --> 28:08.186
Yeah.

28:10.647 --> 28:12.816
You think your latest
intel's good?

28:12.899 --> 28:15.276
On Anderson?
I think so.

28:15.360 --> 28:18.071
I got two CIs that say
he's not using Brill anymore.

28:18.154 --> 28:19.697
He's getting his shit
somewhere else.

28:19.781 --> 28:20.907
Hmm.

28:20.990 --> 28:23.243
Oh, yeah,
there's something else I got.

28:23.326 --> 28:26.496
Last spring,
Anderson got pulled up by BPD

28:26.579 --> 28:29.582
for selling in the parking lot
of Belvedere Towers.

28:29.666 --> 28:34.045
So, city guys roll his car.
They find 300 grams.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.338
That's federal weight.

28:36.714 --> 28:38.341
But he wasn't charged.

28:38.425 --> 28:39.968
What,
he talked himself out of it?

28:40.051 --> 28:42.762
You gotta trade something good
to get out of weight like that.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.556
I like that history.

28:44.639 --> 28:47.142
I like a man
who cooperates early and often.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.560
Or I don't know,
maybe Baltimore City

28:48.643 --> 28:50.603
just does things
different than we do.

28:50.687 --> 28:51.896
Who fucking knows?

28:52.689 --> 28:54.149
Who fucking knows?

28:55.692 --> 28:58.653
Well... Her Honor's had enough.

28:58.736 --> 29:01.239
After Freddie Gray,
I can't blame her.

29:01.322 --> 29:03.366
-But you know what that means?
-No.

29:04.367 --> 29:05.410
The politician that asked us

29:05.493 --> 29:07.162
to come to Baltimore
and fix things

29:07.245 --> 29:10.248
won't be the same politician
that actually has to do it.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.378
Going down.

29:24.971 --> 29:26.222
Yeah, Cherokee.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.558
Tags match.
That's Anderson.

29:28.641 --> 29:30.852
Yeah, this is definitely
where he lays his head.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.437
-Our man's home

29:32.520 --> 29:34.147
-early tonight.

29:36.649 --> 29:38.443
Just the girlfriend
on the apartment lease?

29:39.736 --> 29:41.488
The Cherokee's also in her name.

29:48.077 --> 29:49.704
Wait. Wait. Let him settle.

29:59.714 --> 30:00.840
All right. Go, go.

30:30.453 --> 30:31.996
All right.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.917
We're up on him.
You wanna sit and watch a while?

30:36.000 --> 30:37.752
No. Let's get home,
and see what the tracker

30:37.835 --> 30:40.296
-gives us tomorrow.

30:46.302 --> 30:47.929
You've been a public defender
for how long?

30:48.012 --> 30:50.515
-Hi. I'm almost done.
-Twelve years. Too long.

30:50.598 --> 30:51.933
-Two minutes.

30:52.016 --> 30:54.602
-What does DOJ want from me?
-Give me two minutes.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.479
-Thank you.
-How about a name?

30:56.563 --> 30:58.731
If I was gonna look up
one problem cop

30:58.815 --> 30:59.899
as a prime example

30:59.983 --> 31:01.734
of what's gone
wrong here in Baltimore,

31:01.818 --> 31:02.944
where would I start?

31:03.736 --> 31:04.737
Hersl.

31:05.321 --> 31:07.073
Daniel Hersl.

31:07.156 --> 31:11.411
-H-E-R-S-L.
-Where's he stationed?

31:11.494 --> 31:13.913
Uh,
Eastern District last I checked.

31:14.664 --> 31:15.790
Mm-hmm.

31:15.873 --> 31:18.376
A collection from only
my own cases.

31:19.627 --> 31:23.798
These are some
of the people Hersl arrested.

31:23.881 --> 31:25.925
This is what they look like
going into the jail van

31:26.009 --> 31:27.802
after Hersl's done
arresting them.

31:27.885 --> 31:29.721
Wow.

31:29.804 --> 31:31.723
Any of these have complaints
attached?

31:32.348 --> 31:33.391
All of them.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.810
All unsustained.

31:35.893 --> 31:39.772
-Unsustained?
-Mm-hmm. Not a bug. A feature.

31:44.152 --> 31:46.863
-Daniel Hersl.
-Pick of the litter.

31:47.780 --> 31:49.907
And it's a big litter.

31:49.991 --> 31:51.951
10-11,
meet in the 2700 block

31:52.035 --> 31:53.661
of Eager with a citation book.

31:58.833 --> 32:00.668
License and registration.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.420
Holy shit!

32:02.503 --> 32:03.921
You know that stop sign

32:04.005 --> 32:05.214
at the four-way back there?

32:06.424 --> 32:07.717
You know that means stop, right?

32:07.800 --> 32:10.720
Not pause. Not tap the brakes,
and proceed. Stop.

32:10.803 --> 32:12.013
I made a full stop.

32:12.096 --> 32:15.725
What you want me to do,
put it in park, and sit a while?

32:20.355 --> 32:21.314
Funny.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.316
License and registration.

32:26.736 --> 32:28.237
Why don't you step
out of the vehicle, sir,

32:28.321 --> 32:29.822
so we can get
a good look at you?

32:33.826 --> 32:34.869
That's Hersl.

32:36.329 --> 32:37.580
-Give it here.
-You want me to pull

32:37.664 --> 32:39.499
-my license out first?
-Give it here. Give it here.

32:39.582 --> 32:40.875
Give it here. No need.

32:41.417 --> 32:43.169
-Ah.

32:43.252 --> 32:45.546
Let's see here.
Let's see what we got.

32:52.679 --> 32:53.846
Come on!

32:55.390 --> 32:57.058
All right.

32:57.141 --> 32:58.893
-Yeah. Here it is.

32:58.976 --> 33:00.061
Oh, yeah.

33:01.437 --> 33:02.730
David Baker.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.233
Monument Street.

33:05.942 --> 33:07.402
That's a nice neighborhood.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.613
Congratulations
on all your success.

33:13.741 --> 33:15.451
You can go.

33:15.535 --> 33:19.038
In the future,
Mr. Baker, obey the law.

33:19.122 --> 33:20.790
A little less backtalk, okay?

33:35.888 --> 33:37.682
-Put that in there.

33:37.765 --> 33:40.017
Eager is clear from the incident
on Eastern.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.853
34, 10-4, ma'am. We are on--

33:41.936 --> 33:44.814
And we're up to twenty ODs
in three counties and the city.

33:44.897 --> 33:45.940
Twelve fatal.

33:46.023 --> 33:48.234
That's how I got on Shropshire
and Anderson both.

33:48.317 --> 33:50.486
We've also been
on Shropshire for a while now,

33:50.570 --> 33:51.738
trying to build something.

33:51.821 --> 33:53.740
Given all of the different
jurisdictions, we figured

33:53.823 --> 33:55.116
we might do better
if the task force

33:55.199 --> 33:56.576
took it federal.

33:56.659 --> 33:59.203
These overdoses are interesting.

33:59.287 --> 34:01.247
We've got some statutes
we could apply

34:01.330 --> 34:02.749
in ways the locals can't.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.919
You can definitely tie
the heroin to these crews?

34:07.003 --> 34:09.088
Testimony of at least
four survivors.

34:09.172 --> 34:10.214
It's all coming out of the city.

34:10.298 --> 34:11.841
How close are you on it?

34:11.924 --> 34:13.468
Shropshire's insulated.

34:13.551 --> 34:16.095
-It might take some time.
-But Anderson is sloppy.

34:16.179 --> 34:17.472
We've got a tracker
on his vehicle,

34:17.555 --> 34:19.515
and we're probably a week
from writing warrants.

34:21.726 --> 34:22.727
Okay.

35:12.735 --> 35:13.820
Our boy rolled out.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.615
Ain't nobody else
in that crib, right?

35:17.698 --> 35:19.534
No. Not that I know.

35:20.409 --> 35:22.245
-Watch our six.
-I got you.

35:49.689 --> 35:50.857
Where's my shit at?

35:50.940 --> 35:52.567
Where the fuck's our money
at, bitch?

35:52.650 --> 35:55.611
ANDERSON'
Okay! Okay. What do you want?
What do you--

36:04.245 --> 36:05.580
The fuck is this?

36:07.123 --> 36:08.624
Man, what?

36:08.708 --> 36:09.834
What's "affaint"?

36:11.335 --> 36:12.420
-Affiant.
-Yeah.

36:12.503 --> 36:14.088
The I comes before the A.

36:15.381 --> 36:16.507
Oh, my God.

36:16.591 --> 36:18.009
Did you get it wrong
just the once,

36:18.092 --> 36:19.385
or every fucking time?

36:19.468 --> 36:20.553
Shit.

36:20.636 --> 36:22.555
We're gonna be serving
this warrant at Christmas.

36:22.638 --> 36:24.724
Mm.

36:30.354 --> 36:31.355
There it is.

36:39.196 --> 36:41.240
-Got what we came for?
-Got what was there.

36:41.324 --> 36:43.409
Bitch was so scared,
she damn near pissed herself.

36:43.492 --> 36:45.202
-His girl was up in there.

36:45.286 --> 36:48.205
Wasn't expecting her, but...
she wasn't expecting us neither.

36:48.289 --> 36:49.457
-I bet.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.584
Oh, I love it.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.085
The warrant was all ready to go.

36:53.169 --> 36:55.212
We were gonna take
Anderson's door.

36:55.296 --> 36:56.714
But one hitch.

36:56.797 --> 36:58.466
He suddenly changed his pattern,

36:58.549 --> 37:00.593
and the tracker has given us
a second location

37:00.676 --> 37:02.303
on where he lays his head.

37:02.386 --> 37:04.430
-Where?
-Red Roof Inn.

37:04.513 --> 37:06.807
The one up on Timonium Road,
off of 83.

37:06.891 --> 37:07.934
The last couple nights,

37:08.017 --> 37:10.353
he started staying there
and not the apartment.

37:10.436 --> 37:14.106
-Either another girlfriend...
-Or a stash house.

37:14.190 --> 37:17.109
So, now,
we write on both locations.

37:19.195 --> 37:20.404
He had eight years of your shit.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.073
Plainclothes, too.
I decided I would...

37:24.325 --> 37:25.534
That's your lieutenant?

37:26.160 --> 37:28.162
He's IAD.

37:28.245 --> 37:30.623
We're required to have
an Internal Affairs supervisor

37:30.706 --> 37:33.167
with us on every raid.
We can't kick in a door

37:33.250 --> 37:35.252
without bringing one
of their guys with us.

37:35.336 --> 37:37.546
-That's standard in your county?
-Yeah. With him along,

37:37.630 --> 37:39.257
no one gets sticky fingers,
right?

37:39.340 --> 37:40.841
You think
they do that in the city?

37:40.925 --> 37:42.885
What do you think?

37:47.348 --> 37:49.684
I'll see you in my chambers
at00. Bye.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.521
Judge Moore,
I really do appreciate you

37:53.604 --> 37:55.314
making the time to meet with me.

37:55.398 --> 37:57.108
Kevin Haughton
in the PD's Office,

37:57.191 --> 37:59.860
he said that you might be able
to provide some insight.

38:00.403 --> 38:01.654
How can I help?

38:01.737 --> 38:04.407
I'm trying to find out
about Baltimore officers

38:04.490 --> 38:07.076
whose names keep coming up
repeatedly in complaints,

38:07.159 --> 38:10.538
either excessive force
or civil rights violations,

38:10.621 --> 38:12.081
and he threw a name at me.

38:12.665 --> 38:13.708
Daniel Hersl.

38:14.709 --> 38:15.876
Hersl's not the only one,

38:15.960 --> 38:18.504
but Kevin and I have talked
about him before, so...

38:18.587 --> 38:20.297
He seems
to be a multiple offender.

38:20.381 --> 38:23.551
Mm. You could say so.
About 50 complaints against him.

38:23.634 --> 38:26.846
That's pretty multiple.
Why is he still on the street?

38:26.929 --> 38:28.931
Simply put,
Hersl and guys like him,

38:29.015 --> 38:31.809
they get out of their cars,
and they make arrests.

38:31.892 --> 38:34.103
And that's more than you can say
about too many police

38:34.186 --> 38:35.730
in this city who are collecting
a paycheck.

38:35.813 --> 38:37.023
And it's become a bigger problem

38:37.106 --> 38:38.357
since the Freddie Gray
indictment.

38:38.441 --> 38:40.693
-The work slowdown.
-Exactly.

38:40.776 --> 38:42.820
So, strangely enough,
Hersl has become

38:42.903 --> 38:46.032
an asset these days,
despite his many faults.

38:47.074 --> 38:48.367
In fact, I've had to throw out

38:48.451 --> 38:51.078
several of his arrests
on cases in my court.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.622
And he's come damn close
to perjuring himself

38:53.706 --> 38:56.125
on Fourth Amendment stuff
time and again.

38:56.208 --> 38:58.794
Of course,
that's not unique to him.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.588
You should get a copy
of The List.

39:00.671 --> 39:01.881
-"The List"?
-Yes.

39:01.964 --> 39:05.634
There is a list of about 24
Baltimore police officers

39:05.718 --> 39:07.261
who can no longer
testify in court

39:07.344 --> 39:10.639
because they have been exposed
for on-the-stand perjury.

39:11.348 --> 39:12.391
That many?

39:12.475 --> 39:15.227
And more being added
all the time.

39:15.311 --> 39:17.229
Ugh. And Hersl's on this list?

39:18.064 --> 39:19.732
Not yet, but he should be.

39:24.820 --> 39:26.697
You gonna toss my shit?

39:27.823 --> 39:30.242
I ain't even holdin' nothin',
Hersl.

39:30.326 --> 39:32.495
Officer Hersl to you, shitbird.

39:35.164 --> 39:37.041
-- Hersl.
-- Sir, stay back.

39:37.124 --> 39:38.125
What?

39:40.669 --> 39:41.712
Told your ass.

39:41.796 --> 39:43.339
You ain't even had
no cause to even stop me.

39:43.422 --> 39:45.091
-Yeah!
-This here is harassment.

39:45.174 --> 39:47.301
Yeah. Keep runnin' your gums.

39:47.384 --> 39:49.887
Sick of this shit. And fuck you.

39:53.933 --> 39:55.309
Fuck me, huh?

39:55.393 --> 39:58.854
Yeah? Oh, you see that?
He put his hands on me.

39:58.938 --> 40:00.815
He touched me. Turn around.

40:00.898 --> 40:02.691
I said turn the fuck around.

40:05.152 --> 40:07.905
-- Back the fuck up.
-- Call the van.

40:10.950 --> 40:12.952
Call the van.

40:13.035 --> 40:16.664
31-17 to Dispatch.
10-15 at Lafayette and Bethel.

40:16.747 --> 40:19.583
-Back up.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.502
Wagon to 10-15 Lafayette...

40:21.585 --> 40:24.088
Get back.
Get the fuck back. Stay back.

40:24.171 --> 40:25.714
What's the charge?

40:25.798 --> 40:28.467
Assaulting a police officer.
Resisting.

40:28.551 --> 40:30.427
You fucked me up!

40:30.511 --> 40:33.848
Y'all got nothin', man.
This is bullshit.

40:39.061 --> 40:40.855
Look, look,
I'm canceling that jail wagon

40:40.938 --> 40:43.482
-and calling for a fucking ambo.
-What the fuck?

40:43.566 --> 40:45.192
Throw a Band-Aid on him
in Central Booking.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.944
-He's all right.
-You banged him, Hersl.

40:47.027 --> 40:48.445
Fuck if I'm gonna help
you dump him

40:48.529 --> 40:49.572
in a jail van bleeding,

40:49.655 --> 40:51.657
and have Marilyn Mosby
indict my ass.

40:51.740 --> 40:55.494
-31-17 to Dispatch. 22 to Webb.

40:55.578 --> 40:57.037
Everybody's so fucking
sensitive.

40:57.121 --> 40:59.039
I got my phone.
I got my phone.

40:59.123 --> 41:00.374
There you go.

41:01.750 --> 41:02.918
He's all right.

41:05.838 --> 41:08.215
-- There you go.
-- Thanks!

41:15.014 --> 41:17.808
-Thanks, baby.
-No problem, darling.

41:22.980 --> 41:27.026
-Oh, my goodness.

41:27.109 --> 41:28.402
Bro, this is what
I'm talking about.

41:28.485 --> 41:30.946
-Oh, look at this.
-You know what's up.

41:31.030 --> 41:32.990
Oh, Brill.
There's your girl.

41:33.073 --> 41:34.283
Look at him. Lover boy.

41:34.366 --> 41:37.870
-Yeah.
-Thank you, sweetheart.

41:37.953 --> 41:40.039
Good to be the king.
Y'all scored.

41:40.122 --> 41:42.708
Your boy Glen had it right.

41:42.791 --> 41:45.502
Anderson kept it all
at his spot in Pikesville.

41:45.586 --> 41:48.589
-You heard?
-You took him off your own self?

41:48.672 --> 41:53.302
Nah. It was me and Glen both.
It was nothing, though. He gone.

41:53.385 --> 41:55.095
He left his girl
at the crib, though.

41:55.179 --> 41:57.723
-She see you?

41:57.806 --> 42:02.144
No, she did not see my face,
all right? Relax.

42:03.854 --> 42:06.398
Man, he gonna think I sent
'Twan and Munch to do it.

42:06.482 --> 42:09.527
Mm. But I ain't give a good fuck
what he think.

42:09.610 --> 42:14.406
-That's a broke-ass nigga now.

42:14.490 --> 42:16.242
You cop that Rolex out the deal?

42:16.325 --> 42:20.246
Look at that thing shine.
To the winner go the jewels.

42:23.165 --> 42:24.458
Shakespeare and shit.

42:25.459 --> 42:28.504
-This nigga don't know.

42:28.587 --> 42:31.257
Yo, look. There she is.
Her name Keisha.

42:31.340 --> 42:33.676
I'm throwing 20s at that
like I own this bar,

42:33.759 --> 42:35.552
and have no money
by the end of the night.

42:43.686 --> 42:45.354
-Wait for my go.

43:01.370 --> 43:03.247
-- Go.
-- Police!

43:03.330 --> 43:04.540
Move in! Go, go, go!

43:04.623 --> 43:06.166
Let's roll.
Where you park?

43:06.250 --> 43:07.668
ANDERSON'
You parked it.

43:07.751 --> 43:08.877
Police!

43:08.961 --> 43:10.462
-Don't move! Don't move!
-Shit!

43:10.546 --> 43:11.547
Hands on the railing!

43:11.630 --> 43:13.173
Do it now.
Put your hands on the railing.

43:13.257 --> 43:15.175
Hands on top of your head.
Put 'em on your head!

43:15.259 --> 43:16.635
-Right there, Anderson.
-More of this shit.

43:16.719 --> 43:18.596
-No, there's nothing here.
-Huh?

43:18.679 --> 43:20.347
Yeah, there's no drugs,
no money.

43:20.431 --> 43:22.516
-You're kidding me.
-No guns.

43:22.599 --> 43:24.727
But someone turned
this place over,

43:24.810 --> 43:27.062
or Anderson cleared it out
before he moved.

43:27.146 --> 43:29.523
-Really? Shit.
-And get this.

43:29.606 --> 43:31.191
The door had already
been splintered

43:31.275 --> 43:32.443
when we put the ram to it.

43:32.526 --> 43:34.820
-That's interesting.
-Yeah. What about you?

43:34.903 --> 43:36.530
We just started our search.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.949
Looks like him and his girl
moved out here for keeps.

43:39.033 --> 43:40.909
All their shit is stacked up
around the room.

43:40.993 --> 43:42.202
All right.

43:42.286 --> 43:43.495
-Oh, and, hey.
-Yep?

43:43.579 --> 43:46.332
Make sure you get the tracker
off of his jeep, okay?

43:46.415 --> 43:48.625
-Those things are expensive.
-Got it.

44:04.475 --> 44:05.517
What the...

44:14.735 --> 44:16.278
What the actual fuck?

44:18.072 --> 44:20.908
I told Vanita,
"This agency is open to you,"

44:20.991 --> 44:22.618
because the truth
is I'm not afraid

44:22.701 --> 44:25.704
of a consent decree.
I policed under a consent decree

44:25.788 --> 44:28.499
when I was assistant chief
down at PG County, and--

44:28.582 --> 44:30.000
and that decree
helped us restore

44:30.084 --> 44:31.251
some trust in the community.

44:31.335 --> 44:33.420
Well, a consent decree is just
a piece of paper

44:33.504 --> 44:35.923
unless the politicians
and the police agencies

44:36.006 --> 44:39.093
-actually implement change.
-Yeah, very true. Water?

44:39.176 --> 44:40.386
Oh, please.

44:40.469 --> 44:41.720
So, let me ask you this.

44:41.804 --> 44:44.515
And I'm fully aware you've only
been police commissioner

44:44.598 --> 44:46.350
for a few months,
and I'm not asking you

44:46.433 --> 44:49.019
to personally account
for all of this.

44:49.103 --> 44:51.939
But how the hell
does an officer rack up

44:52.022 --> 44:55.401
over 50 civilian complaints
of brutality and abuse

44:55.484 --> 44:57.778
in one career,
and remain on the street?

44:57.861 --> 45:00.739
-Hersl.
-That name came easy enough.

45:00.823 --> 45:01.990
I first heard it from one

45:02.074 --> 45:04.368
of the West Baltimore ministers
when I got to town.

45:04.451 --> 45:07.579
In-- in fact, he gave me
two names of shady cops.

45:07.663 --> 45:10.082
Daniel Hersl and Fabien Laronde.

45:10.165 --> 45:12.418
Hersl, as you point out,
is still on the street,

45:12.501 --> 45:14.211
but do you know
where Laronde is?

45:14.294 --> 45:17.005
He's awaiting a trial board
and he's off the street.

45:17.089 --> 45:19.383
And he's not charged
with anything big,

45:19.466 --> 45:21.718
but I've told my IAD people

45:21.802 --> 45:25.556
that if the trial board finds
against him, he's gone.

45:25.639 --> 45:29.309
So, what's the difference
between Laronde and Hersl?

45:29.393 --> 45:33.981
Laronde has sustained
complaints. Five, in fact.

45:34.064 --> 45:36.108
So, his jacket has enough
that I can say,

45:36.191 --> 45:38.735
"Screw the union.
Screw the rank-and-file.

45:38.819 --> 45:41.905
This guy is bad. This guy goes."

45:41.989 --> 45:45.033
Hersl has a single
sustained complaint.

45:46.201 --> 45:49.204
So, how does Hersl generate
so many complaints,

45:49.288 --> 45:51.957
year after year,
and so little is sustained?

45:52.040 --> 45:55.210
And how is it that Laronde,
with five sustained complaints,

45:55.294 --> 45:56.587
is still on payroll

45:56.670 --> 45:58.088
and is still awaiting
a trial board?

45:58.172 --> 46:01.717
This is the department
that I inherited, Ms. Steele.

46:02.593 --> 46:04.178
These are the tools I have.

46:05.929 --> 46:07.431
-7-0-7...

46:07.514 --> 46:10.017
-Is that 1-6 or 1-8?
-It's 1-6.

46:10.100 --> 46:14.021
7-0-7-4-1-6.
A as in apple, C as in Charlie.

46:14.104 --> 46:15.981
It's on the subpoena
that we faxed over to you.

46:16.064 --> 46:17.191
Crazy, man. If it hadn't felt

46:17.274 --> 46:19.234
a little different in my hand,
I wouldn't have known.

46:19.318 --> 46:21.320
It was only inches
from our tracker.

46:21.403 --> 46:23.822
One jeep, two trackers. Crazy.

46:23.906 --> 46:25.449
Can you spell that for me?

46:25.532 --> 46:26.950
-C-L-E-W-E-L-L.
-All right.

46:27.034 --> 46:29.036
All right, thanks.
Appreciate the assistance.

46:33.582 --> 46:35.918
Who the fuck is John L. Clewell,

46:36.001 --> 46:39.171
and why is his tracker
on our suspect's Jeep Cherokee?

46:40.547 --> 46:42.841
Oh, but she got them titties,
though. Ah!

46:42.925 --> 46:44.593
Nigga,
that's all you care about.

46:44.676 --> 46:46.428
Stop playing.
I like that ass too.

46:46.512 --> 46:48.764
Women gonna be your downfall.

46:48.847 --> 46:50.724
Look, I like to have the ones
I ain't had.

46:50.807 --> 46:52.809
-I bet you do.
-Don't be so critical, my nigga.

46:52.893 --> 46:54.144
-God damn.
-Whatever, nigga. You--

46:56.813 --> 46:58.315
We gonna collect
some taxes today?

46:58.398 --> 47:00.692
Hey. Easy in front of choir boy.

47:01.693 --> 47:02.736
Yo, you come empty-handed?

47:02.819 --> 47:04.363
You ain't bring me
no sandwich or nothin'?

47:04.446 --> 47:05.531
Fuck you, Gondo.

47:05.614 --> 47:07.658
All right,
Detective Clewell.

47:07.741 --> 47:09.535
No sandwich for me today.

47:09.618 --> 47:11.328
Let's go get some guns
off the street.

47:11.954 --> 47:13.497
Huh?

47:17.709 --> 47:20.587
-Clewell was a jarhead.

47:20.671 --> 47:22.172
Before he joined BPD.

47:22.256 --> 47:24.716
His bio says
he was a city cop since '09.

47:24.800 --> 47:26.760
Gun Trace Task Force now.

47:26.843 --> 47:28.554
So, they put the tracker
on his truck?

47:28.637 --> 47:29.888
They were up on Anderson too?

47:29.972 --> 47:31.640
If they were,
they didn't put anything

47:31.723 --> 47:33.141
in the database
for deconfliction.

47:33.225 --> 47:34.518
-Sloppy.
-Another thing

47:34.601 --> 47:37.104
is this is not
a department-issued tracker.

47:37.187 --> 47:39.314
Man, city guys are always
on their ass.

47:39.398 --> 47:41.066
A lot of them even buy
their own gear.

47:41.149 --> 47:43.360
...Please report to the...

47:43.443 --> 47:44.778
But I guess
we should call them

47:44.861 --> 47:47.990
-and let them know we have it.

47:48.657 --> 47:49.700
We just popped Anderson.

47:49.783 --> 47:51.410
That's going in the computer,
right?

47:51.785 --> 47:53.078
Right.

47:53.161 --> 47:56.373
Yeah. So, if they're up on him,
they'll come talk.

47:57.124 --> 47:58.792
When they do, I'll make sure

47:58.875 --> 48:01.128
and remember to give that back
to Detective Clewell.

48:03.046 --> 48:04.548
I'm also gonna let
the feds know.

48:05.340 --> 48:06.383
Mm.

48:06.884 --> 48:07.968
Yeah.

48:10.220 --> 48:11.638
-Bingo.
-Yo, that ain't mine.

48:11.722 --> 48:13.307
-No?
-There's a dude I gave a ride to

48:13.390 --> 48:15.684
for the party last night.
He must have left it in my car.

48:15.767 --> 48:17.394
Oh, really?
He got a name?

48:17.477 --> 48:19.271
I expect he does,
but I don't know it.

48:19.354 --> 48:20.439
Okay.

48:20.522 --> 48:22.107
Why you pull me over anyway?

48:23.525 --> 48:25.319
Why did we pull him over?

48:26.570 --> 48:29.156
Rear license obscured.

48:29.239 --> 48:32.075
-It don't look obscured to me.
-Why you acting brand-new, man?

48:33.702 --> 48:35.495
-We good here?
-Yeah, I got it.

48:36.747 --> 48:38.790
Hey, Gondo, what's up
with that tracker I lent you?

48:38.874 --> 48:40.709
-Yeah, what about it?
-That shit costs.

48:40.792 --> 48:43.128
Oh, why?
You can't afford it,
a big timer like you?

48:43.211 --> 48:44.338
-Whatever.

48:44.421 --> 48:45.922
Just get it back to me, okay?

48:47.049 --> 48:49.593
-This man.
-What's up, Sarge?

48:49.676 --> 48:51.470
What we got,
the brain trust here?

48:51.553 --> 48:53.680
You lost, Sergeant Allers?

48:53.764 --> 48:55.515
-You lost?
-No, man.

48:55.599 --> 48:57.809
I mean, I see you guys
standing around...

48:58.769 --> 49:00.228
looking all helpless.

49:00.312 --> 49:01.438
Nobody helpless.

49:01.521 --> 49:02.981
I'm thinking you can use
some assistance

49:03.065 --> 49:04.566
from your actual supervisor.

49:05.651 --> 49:06.693
What'd you pull?

49:07.527 --> 49:09.529
A gun, but no drugs or cash.

49:13.992 --> 49:15.494
-You want some of this?
-Ain't know

49:15.577 --> 49:16.870
Sarge had them hands, boy.

49:16.953 --> 49:18.997
Didn't know Sarge
have them hands on him.

49:20.707 --> 49:22.459
Charlie come with that one-two.

49:22.542 --> 49:24.544
All right, ladies, I'm 10-7.

49:24.628 --> 49:26.254
I'ma head on down
to Pulaski Highway,

49:26.338 --> 49:27.631
-get that pit beef.
-Mm.

49:27.714 --> 49:29.299
I'm on the radio
if you need me, all right?

49:29.383 --> 49:30.550
-All right.
-All right, Sarge.

49:30.634 --> 49:31.885
Man, get out of here.

49:32.969 --> 49:34.763
Gondo, pay attention, man.

49:35.931 --> 49:37.391
All units be advised,

49:37.474 --> 49:40.686
Sergeant Allers is 10-7
and procuring pit beef.

49:47.943 --> 49:49.152
Hey, yo.

49:52.739 --> 49:53.990
Allers?

49:54.074 --> 49:56.368
-He's one of yours now.
-One of ours?

49:57.244 --> 49:58.412
He got himself assigned to work

49:58.495 --> 50:01.123
with the DEA task force,
right?

50:01.206 --> 50:03.583
I'm just saying
he ain't street police no more,

50:03.667 --> 50:04.835
if he ever was.

50:07.087 --> 50:08.588
Shit.

50:08.672 --> 50:10.757
Yo, I didn't mean any offense.

50:10.841 --> 50:13.844
You feds got some game.

50:14.845 --> 50:16.221
I mean, she got moves.

50:20.517 --> 50:23.478
I'm just sayin' when it come
down to the street...

50:23.562 --> 50:27.023
we're the ones who got the guns,
who brought the drugs.

50:27.107 --> 50:28.775
We were the cops they wanted.

50:37.826 --> 50:39.828
It's a hell
of a rip, Sergeant Jenkins.

50:39.911 --> 50:41.288
I appreciate that, sir.

50:41.371 --> 50:42.581
In the wake of this seizure,

50:42.664 --> 50:44.499
let me ask you if you have any
thoughts on the fact

50:44.583 --> 50:46.084
that many of our officers
have been reluctant

50:46.168 --> 50:47.961
to even attempt arrests
in the two years

50:48.044 --> 50:49.463
since the Freddie Gray
indictments?

50:49.546 --> 50:51.506
Now, look, uh, DC,

50:51.590 --> 50:53.550
I'm sure you know
the deal same as me.

50:53.633 --> 50:55.677
Officers involved
in the Freddie Gray arrest,

50:55.761 --> 50:57.637
they got the raw deal
in that indictment.

50:57.721 --> 51:00.265
But those cases are coming out
the right way in court.

51:00.348 --> 51:01.683
Now, I can't think of any reason

51:01.767 --> 51:04.728
whatsoever, why would we need
to stand down on making arrests,

51:04.811 --> 51:06.146
as long
as they're the right arrests?

51:06.229 --> 51:08.398
But many in the rank and file
disagree with you, Sergeant.

51:08.482 --> 51:10.942
Citywide,
our arrests are down 60 percent

51:11.026 --> 51:13.361
-since the indictments.
-I can't speak to that, sir,

51:13.445 --> 51:16.031
but I can speak--
can speak to my unit.

51:16.114 --> 51:17.199
Gun Trace Task Force,

51:17.282 --> 51:19.242
our arrests are up
over the last eight weeks.

51:19.326 --> 51:20.827
Now, look,
the numbers don't lie.

51:20.911 --> 51:23.246
You compare our stats
post-Freddie Gray to before,

51:23.330 --> 51:25.123
you'll see exactly
what I'm talking about.

51:25.207 --> 51:26.958
You don't worry about going out
on the street

51:27.042 --> 51:29.294
and ending up on someone's
viral video, Sergeant Jenkins?

51:29.377 --> 51:31.254
Hey, as long as they get
my good side.

51:31.338 --> 51:33.173
-Ladies and gentlemen,

51:33.256 --> 51:35.926
what you see here,
this is the result of one raid

51:36.009 --> 51:37.928
on one house
in Collington Square.

51:38.011 --> 51:39.513
Now,
we are the Gun Trace Task Force.

51:39.596 --> 51:41.932
We get guns off the street.
It's what we do.

51:42.015 --> 51:43.600
Now, with a little
more personnel,

51:43.683 --> 51:44.893
a lot more overtime,

51:44.976 --> 51:46.853
there's no telling the effect
that we could have

51:46.937 --> 51:48.980
reducing the surge of violence
in this city.

51:49.773 --> 51:51.274
Tell us about the PC
that got you

51:51.358 --> 51:52.734
through that door on that raid?

51:52.818 --> 51:54.110
That's a good question, sir.

51:54.194 --> 51:55.737
Look, I've been working
with the same CI

51:55.821 --> 51:57.489
over in the Eastern
for the last 18 months.

52:00.534 --> 52:01.535
Seven?

52:03.078 --> 52:04.246
It may go further.

52:08.583 --> 52:11.169
And the Bureau couldn't
have told me any earlier?

52:11.253 --> 52:14.047
Of course not, Kev.
You know this.

52:17.259 --> 52:18.301
Tomorrow morning?

52:31.273 --> 52:32.524
-Hey, I heard you

52:32.607 --> 52:33.900
on the funding
for the plainclothes work,

52:33.984 --> 52:35.360
and we're gonna do
what we can, Wayne.

52:35.443 --> 52:36.987
I know you will, DC,
I appreciate you.

52:37.070 --> 52:38.363
-PALMERE Excuse me.
-Yeah.

52:38.446 --> 52:39.489
Oh, shit.

52:39.573 --> 52:41.575
We got a lot of guns
on the table today.

52:41.658 --> 52:43.535
Here. I need these officers
to report

52:43.618 --> 52:45.036
to the offsite tomorrow.
You tell them.

52:45.120 --> 52:46.413
I mean,
it's a million things.

52:46.496 --> 52:49.416
Tell you what.
You know what I'm saying.

52:49.499 --> 52:51.251
Well, as it happens,
Sergeant Jenkins,

52:51.334 --> 52:53.461
IAD just called down here,
and asked if they could see you

52:53.545 --> 52:55.338
up on Kirk Avenue
at00 a.m. tomorrow.

52:55.422 --> 52:56.423
Oh, yeah?

52:56.506 --> 52:58.174
Doesn't sound like anything
you can't handle.

52:58.258 --> 53:00.468
Something about some damage
to the rear quarter panel

53:00.552 --> 53:03.096
of a department vehicle
that you didn't report properly.

53:03.179 --> 53:05.599
-Wow. A real career-ender.

53:07.350 --> 53:08.602
Thanks, DC.

53:20.280 --> 53:21.281
Look at you, Steve.

53:21.364 --> 53:22.908
Getting that good police
work in, huh?

53:22.991 --> 53:25.535
You know, committing suicide
by cigarette.

53:25.619 --> 53:27.495
-You got a date with IAD?
-Yeah.

53:27.579 --> 53:30.040
Some nuisance shit.
You know, vehicular.

53:30.123 --> 53:31.625
Can't fuck with Superman.

53:35.795 --> 53:37.505
-What's the word, Charlie?
-Hey.

53:56.858 --> 53:58.735
-What's going, fellas?
-What's going on, Wayne?

53:58.818 --> 53:59.945
You know?

54:10.914 --> 54:12.248
Linda.

54:12.332 --> 54:13.959
What's going on, hon? You good?

54:14.542 --> 54:15.627
Hey, Wayne.

54:25.095 --> 54:27.013
Let's go up to the meeting room.

54:27.097 --> 54:28.181
Okay.

54:38.108 --> 54:40.443
Man, you looking at my ass?

54:42.112 --> 54:43.279
I know you are.

54:44.406 --> 54:46.616
Nigel told me
you don't know how to swim.

54:46.700 --> 54:48.201
Is that true?
What kind of grown-ass

54:48.284 --> 54:49.911
fuckin' man doesn't know
how to swim, man?

54:49.995 --> 54:51.663
Please tell me
that's a bullshit rumor, man.

54:51.746 --> 54:55.458
FBI! FBI! Give me your hands!
Hands! Hands! Hands!

54:58.670 --> 55:00.880
-Hands, hands, hands!
-I'm one of you!

55:00.964 --> 55:02.590
I'm one of you, man!

55:02.674 --> 55:04.009
I'm one of you.

55:04.092 --> 55:06.553
You're not one of us.
It's all good, Commissioner.

55:06.636 --> 55:10.265
Man,
get your fucking hands off me.

55:10.348 --> 55:11.725
You're on my fucking arm--

55:15.729 --> 55:18.148
-What's the holdup?
-Waiting on our SAC.

55:20.150 --> 55:22.193
The commissioner
wants just a moment.

55:23.778 --> 55:24.821
Sir.

55:31.119 --> 55:32.162
Huh.

55:37.625 --> 55:38.668
Okay.

55:40.336 --> 55:41.796
-Okay.

56:05.528 --> 56:06.571
Fuck.

56:21.336 --> 56:23.505
The rest of them looked away.

56:23.588 --> 56:26.549
Not this motherfucker.
Not for a second.

56:30.095 --> 56:31.221
Motherfucker.

56:49.030 --> 56:50.782
Do you guys know who I am?
