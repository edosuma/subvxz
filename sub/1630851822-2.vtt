So if you have
canola or vegetable oil,

<i>since you're using something</i>
<i>that's a bit more shallow,</i>

05:53.519 --> 05:55.938

06:28.387 --> 06:30.431
- So 3/4 of a cup of flour.

06:30.515 --> 06:31.474
I'm just gonna eyeball it,

06:31.557 --> 06:32.642

06:32.725 --> 06:34.477
- Okay.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.187
- Three little scoops?
Yeah, I think that's about--

06:36.270 --> 06:37.814
- Yeah, is that 1/4 cup?

06:37.897 --> 06:39.899

- Three of these.

06:39.982 --> 06:43.277
- Wait a minute.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.612
- Why don't you just scoop it
with the thing?

06:44.695 --> 06:45.780
- Oh, yeah, why didn't--

06:45.863 --> 06:47.365
Oh, no.
- [laughing]

06:47.448 --> 06:49.659
- Okay, we're good.
We're good, we're good.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.619
- And then use
that same scoop to get

06:51.702 --> 06:53.079
1/4 cup of corn starch.

garlic powder,

07:02.880 --> 07:03.840

07:41.794 --> 07:43.045
- And that's our dry mixture.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.505
So I'm gonna set that aside.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.883
<i>Let's grab some buttermilk,</i>

07:46.966 --> 07:48.426
and you can grab
your chicken now too.

07:48.509 --> 07:50.136
- You mind grabbing that...
- I got you.

07:50.219 --> 07:52.889
- While I make sure
this is all mixed in?

07:52.972 --> 07:54.807
- Buttermilk and chicken.

07:54.891 --> 07:58.686
- So our wet mixture now
is just a cup of buttermilk.

07:58.769 --> 08:00.021
- Whoo-hoo.

08:00.104 --> 08:01.731
- Add a teaspoon
of the onion powder,

08:01.814 --> 08:02.690
the garlic powder,

08:02.773 --> 08:03.733
and the smoked paprika

08:03.816 --> 08:05.401
into this wet mixture.

08:05.484 --> 08:06.652
Then you're gonna
whisk it all together.

08:06.736 --> 08:07.987
- Okay.
<i>- Do you have</i>

08:08.070 --> 08:10.114
some fresh garlic cloves,
by chance?

08:10.198 --> 08:12.074
- Yes, I do.
- One clove

08:12.158 --> 08:13.534
is more than enough.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.995
<i>Is yours chopped up?</i>
- It's not chopped.

08:16.078 --> 08:16.996
- It's just this.

08:17.079 --> 08:18.247
Can you see?
- Yes.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.582
A lot of people use their knife

08:19.665 --> 08:20.666
to smash it,
but I feel like

08:20.750 --> 08:22.335
that's a little dangerous.

08:22.418 --> 08:24.253
So I like to use
the bottom of the jar,

08:24.337 --> 08:25.379
and I just, like, press down.

08:25.463 --> 08:26.422
- Selena gets a little

08:26.505 --> 08:27.757
crazy with the knife.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.592
- It's right there.
- Oh, okay.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.135
Yeah, it's probably best.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.054
- We love a safe option.

08:33.137 --> 08:34.222
- Oh, this is a new--

08:34.305 --> 08:35.514
[glass shatters]
- Oh!

08:35.598 --> 08:36.599
[dog whimpers]

08:36.682 --> 08:38.226
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

08:39.227 --> 08:41.437
- She just broke the--
- She shattered the--

08:41.520 --> 08:42.980
- Look at Ayesha's face!

08:43.064 --> 08:45.441
- She shattered it.
- How does this happen?

08:45.524 --> 08:46.609
You can't make this up.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.027
<i>- Be careful.</i>

08:48.110 --> 08:50.488
You're freakin' strong!
[all laughing]

08:50.571 --> 08:52.448
- Let's move it
and then flip it, like--

08:52.531 --> 08:53.783
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Like the real chefs do.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.326
- Let's do that. Hang on.
- Wait.

08:55.409 --> 08:56.786
- I mean,
it's season three, guys,

08:56.869 --> 08:58.454
and we're still
having these mishaps!

08:58.538 --> 09:00.414
- I thought the knife was
gonna be dangerous, and l--

09:00.498 --> 09:01.832
<i>- I can't believe it.</i>

09:01.916 --> 09:03.960
- I'm gonna do it
with a knife, okay?

09:04.043 --> 09:06.712
<i>- I do not wanna be</i>
<i>the one to come on here</i>

09:06.796 --> 09:09.548
and be the one that had, like,
Selena Gomez cut her hand.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.634
[all laughing]

09:11.717 --> 09:14.178
All right,
so just a little mince.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.972
- Okay.
- Oh, you're--golden.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.598
<i>Yeah, that looks great.</i>
- Okay.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.393
Now, do you want me to put
this garlic in the wet...

09:20.476 --> 09:22.562
stuff?
- [laughs]

09:22.645 --> 09:24.522
- Yep,
and then whisk that in as well.

09:24.605 --> 09:25.898
- Okay.
<i>- And then that's it.</i>

09:25.982 --> 09:29.360
Now we can actually
make the glaze

09:29.443 --> 09:31.028
for our sweet chili chickpeas.

09:31.112 --> 09:32.655
<i>They should actually be ready.</i>

09:33.531 --> 09:34.782
All right.
Oh, yeah.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.660
- Does the--
how's this going?

09:37.743 --> 09:38.995
- They look so good.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.289
- Fantastic.
Get a mixing bowl.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.416
- Mixing bowl, mixing bowl.

09:43.499 --> 09:45.334
Maybe this one?
- Yeah.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.253
I'm likin' the look of that.
- Since it's for the chicken.

09:47.336 --> 09:49.005
- I can't believe
you guys have the same bowls.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.798
- Ah!
Now I can tell everyone

09:50.881 --> 09:52.800
I have the same bowls
as Ayesha Curry.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.261
- The same clear bowls.
- The same clear bowl

09:55.344 --> 09:57.847
that millions of people
around the world have.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.223
- Let me have this one.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.350
[all laughing]

10:01.434 --> 10:03.311
- Sweet chili sauce.
- Okay, yes.

10:03.394 --> 10:05.896
- One of my favorite things
just on its own, honestly.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.566
I put this stuff on everything.
- It's so good.

10:08.649 --> 10:10.359
- Four tablespoons.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.610
Or 1/4 cup.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.112
- Like that?
<i>- That's perfect.</i>

10:13.195 --> 10:14.572
<i>Perfect, perfect.</i>
- Oh, that's four, yeah.

10:14.655 --> 10:15.948
- Let's get the chickpeas
into the bowl.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.367
- Okay.
- We're gonna toss 'em.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.870
- They look so cute.
Cute and crispy.

10:20.953 --> 10:24.290
- Coat all the chickpeas
in that sweet chili.

10:24.373 --> 10:25.541
<i>All that's left, we're gonna</i>

10:25.625 --> 10:26.876
zest a little bit of lemon.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.045
About one to two teaspoons.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.379
It just depends on how lemony

10:30.463 --> 10:32.340
<i>you want this.</i>

10:32.423 --> 10:34.091
- Oh, my God.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.384
- It's fine.
It's fine.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.428
- Mm.
- [laughs]

10:37.511 --> 10:39.722
- [laughs]
The only thing left to do

10:39.805 --> 10:40.723
is to finish it off

10:40.806 --> 10:42.391
with some flaky sea salt

10:42.475 --> 10:44.226
or some Maldon salt.
<i>- Okay.</i>

10:44.310 --> 10:46.062
<i>- If you wanna eat it</i>
<i>out of that, you can.</i>

10:46.145 --> 10:47.813
<i>Or if you wanna</i>
<i>make it look pretty,</i>

10:47.897 --> 10:49.482
you can pop it
into another bowl.

10:49.565 --> 10:52.526
- We gotta make it look pretty.
- Yeah, I was gonna say.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.737
Especially
if Diego's coming over.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.322
- Oh, my gosh.
Stop.

10:56.405 --> 10:57.573
- [laughs]

10:57.656 --> 10:59.867
- You can taste test
if you want.

10:59.950 --> 11:02.161
- I wanna try one.
- Yum!

11:02.244 --> 11:04.497
- Oh, my gosh.
- They're good, right?

11:04.580 --> 11:05.915
- This is really good.
Okay, wait.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.416
Don't eat it all.
Wait.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.585
- I'm hungry.
- [laughs]

11:10.503 --> 11:13.923
- Love this.
- [laughs]

11:14.006 --> 11:17.218
- So we can start getting
our chicken thighs ready.

11:17.301 --> 11:19.512
- Okay.
- So all we're gonna do,

11:19.595 --> 11:22.264
super simple, take our chicken,

11:22.348 --> 11:24.642
put it into the wet mixture.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.644
- Okay.
<i>- Coat both sides.</i>

11:26.727 --> 11:28.562
And then into the dry.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.482
- Flip it a few times?
- You can, yeah.

11:31.565 --> 11:33.818
- So I have
a seven-year-old sister,

11:33.901 --> 11:36.946
and she loves to bake
and loves to cook,

11:37.029 --> 11:39.907
but I don't know if you cook
with your kids or your family.

11:39.990 --> 11:43.619
Like, what's the easiest thing,
as I get my chicken ready,

11:43.702 --> 11:45.913
that I could do with my sister?

11:45.996 --> 11:47.498
- Even giving them a job,

11:47.581 --> 11:50.334
with anything that you're
cooking, instills confidence.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.545
I do cook with my kids
all the time.

11:52.628 --> 11:54.171
- Ah, I love that.
<i>- And they just have</i>

11:54.255 --> 11:57.133
so much joy, and they're
honestly typically willing

11:57.216 --> 12:00.594
to try new things if they
have a hand in making it.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.264
So something as simple as--
they make amazing kids' knives

12:03.347 --> 12:05.057
these days, so you don't
have to worry about

12:05.141 --> 12:06.976
anybody cuttin'
their fingers off.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.478
- She has those.
<i>- Yeah, perfect!</i>

12:09.562 --> 12:11.480
So, like,
chopping up the vegetables

12:11.564 --> 12:14.400
or whatever, like, just
something simple like that,

12:14.483 --> 12:16.694
<i>I think, just brings them</i>
<i>so much confidence</i>

12:16.777 --> 12:18.821
that they'll then take
with them into their adulthood.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.490
- That's so sweet.
<i>- For the next thing</i>

12:21.574 --> 12:22.992
we're gonna make,
prosciutto-wrapped dates,

12:23.075 --> 12:24.660
you wanna have your oven
at 450.

12:24.743 --> 12:26.454
<i>So you might just wanna</i>
<i>crank it up a little bit.</i>

12:26.537 --> 12:29.123
- Okay.
- Oh, I'm so excited for that.

12:29.206 --> 12:31.333
- So your oil
should be to temp.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.002
- It's honestly good.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.462
- Let's get it in there.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.841
<i>Since you're in</i>
<i>a shallow dish,</i>

12:38.924 --> 12:40.009
<i>you're gonna have to flip.</i>

12:40.092 --> 12:41.427
My pot is a little deep,

12:41.510 --> 12:42.720
so it's just in there.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.221
I'm not gonna have
to flip anything.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.890
- Okay.
<i>- Ladies, I don't know</i>

12:45.973 --> 12:47.892
<i>if you could time</i>
<i>three minutes for her...</i>

12:47.975 --> 12:50.352
- I'm on it.
<i>- Until she has to flip.</i>

12:50.436 --> 12:52.646
I know, it's hot.
- [laughs]

12:52.730 --> 12:54.857
- So do you like
cooking at home more,

12:54.940 --> 12:57.109
or do you like
going out to eat as well?

12:57.193 --> 12:59.528
- My answer a year ago
would have been

12:59.612 --> 13:03.324
I love to cook at home,
and everybody needs to do it,

13:03.407 --> 13:06.118
and da-da-da-da-da,
but since the pandemic hit,

13:06.202 --> 13:08.496
I'm like,
oh, we're going out to eat?

13:08.579 --> 13:10.206
<i>Let's do it!</i>
- Yeah.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.208
- I don't mind takeout
every once in a while,

13:12.291 --> 13:15.377
and I certainly don't mind
going out to a restaurant.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.754
- I know.
We feel you.

13:16.837 --> 13:19.215
I'll never take it
for granted again,

13:19.298 --> 13:21.008
being able
to just go to dinner.

13:21.091 --> 13:23.594
- Ever, ever.
- Yeah, honestly.

13:23.677 --> 13:25.554
Is the timer up, babe?
- Oh!

13:25.638 --> 13:27.556
Let me check.
- [laughs]

13:27.640 --> 13:30.351
- Yes, it is!
- Okay, let's see.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.353
- Set that timer
for another four minutes.

13:32.436 --> 13:33.812
- Okay, another four minutes.

13:33.896 --> 13:36.106
I like the timing.
That helps me out.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.983
<i>- And you'll still</i>
<i>have to check it,</i>

13:38.067 --> 13:39.652
but I think
we're gonna be all right,

13:39.735 --> 13:42.738
<i>'cause again, that</i>
<i>chicken thigh is so thin,</i>

13:42.821 --> 13:44.573
<i>so it should cook pretty fast.</i>

13:44.657 --> 13:48.661
That stove--
that hood is just--it's epic.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.579
- Yeah, I'm so happy.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.707
- It's iconic.
[all laughing]

13:55.251 --> 13:56.752
- I think they're lookin' good.

13:56.835 --> 13:59.088
- I just have to say, KFC who?

13:59.171 --> 14:01.423
- [laughs]
- KFC who?

14:01.507 --> 14:03.676
This is amazing!
- Okay!

14:03.759 --> 14:04.969
Here we go.

14:05.052 --> 14:07.221
- Honestly,
that looks incredible.

14:07.304 --> 14:10.015
<i>It looks better than mine.</i>
<i>But let's check that</i>

14:10.099 --> 14:12.017
<i>temperature of the chicken.</i>

14:12.101 --> 14:13.727
165 at least.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.104
- It's 178.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.106
- Whoo!
Perfect.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.649
- Yes, we're doin' it.
- Whoo-hoo!

14:18.732 --> 14:20.484
- I can't get over
this chicken.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.820
- Me neither.
- And the fact that you did it.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.238
- Well--
- I'm shook.

14:24.321 --> 14:25.906
- [scoffs]
Okay, well, maybe

14:25.990 --> 14:27.449
don't be too shook.
- I didn't mean it that way.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.286
No, I'm just, like--I'm in awe.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.121
- I love it.
It's the simple things.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.623
- No oil mishaps or anything.
It's great.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.585
- Yep.
Just breaking glass over here.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.503
[all laughing]
- It's okay.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.463
<i>Last is our dates.</i>

14:41.547 --> 14:42.881
I love the texture of them.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.426
I like the natural sweetness.
- Yeah.

14:45.509 --> 14:47.970
<i>- It's such a great</i>
<i>sugar alternative</i>

14:48.053 --> 14:49.638
<i>when you're craving</i>
<i>something sweet.</i>

14:49.722 --> 14:51.307
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- And then this is, like,</i>

14:51.390 --> 14:52.975
the perfect bite-size appetizer

14:53.058 --> 14:54.643
for a viewing party,
so it makes sense.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.895
- Perfect.
<i>- First things first,</i>

14:56.979 --> 14:59.273
you'll wanna grab your
prosciutto from the fridge

14:59.356 --> 15:01.358
and your Gorgonzola cheese.
- Okay.

15:01.442 --> 15:04.570
- Oh, we love
Gorgonzola cheese.

15:04.653 --> 15:06.697
- I like to keep the prosciutto
in till, like, the last minute,

15:06.780 --> 15:09.074
'cause when it gets warm,
it's, like, hard to work with.

15:09.158 --> 15:12.161
- Ooh, crumbly Gorgonzola.

15:12.244 --> 15:13.537
- You can make
however many you'd like,

15:13.621 --> 15:14.830
but the first thing
we're gonna do

15:14.913 --> 15:16.165
is take off the tops

15:16.248 --> 15:18.459
off of these dates like that.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.961
<i>And then take a small knife</i>

15:21.045 --> 15:22.796
and just
put a little slit in it

15:22.880 --> 15:24.173
and then pop that seed out.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.342
- She makes me so nervous
with the knife.

15:26.425 --> 15:29.428
- What if there's no seed?
- We got lucky.

15:29.511 --> 15:32.306
- Yeah.
- We have pitted fresh dates.

15:32.389 --> 15:34.642
- Oh, we're already pitted?
- So ours are pitted already.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.935
- Okay, well,
I'm gonna pit my dates.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.771
<i>You gotta wait for me</i>
<i>to pit these dates.</i>

15:38.854 --> 15:40.230
- No, it's okay.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.608
- I feel like
this appetizer is, like,

15:42.691 --> 15:46.570
the perfect combination
of sweet and salty and creamy.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.365
- Mm.
<i>- All right, so the next step,</i>

15:49.448 --> 15:52.076
let's get our
rimmed baking sheet ready.

15:52.159 --> 15:54.370
- Our rimmed baking sheet.
- There it is.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.538
- Got it.
- And honestly, I don't know

15:56.622 --> 15:58.874
why it's called ri--
I mean, it has a rim,

15:58.957 --> 16:02.544
<i>but I don't know why it has</i>
<i>to be so extra in particular.</i>

16:02.628 --> 16:04.797
Like, anything will do.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.966
If you have foil paper at home
and you gotta just

16:08.050 --> 16:10.010
<i>double up the foil paper,</i>
<i>that's fine too.</i>

16:10.094 --> 16:13.055
Whatever you have.
[both laughing]

16:14.264 --> 16:16.809
- What happened?
- I just--I was in awe of you,

16:16.892 --> 16:20.562
so I just looked like an idiot
watching you, 'cause I--

16:20.646 --> 16:23.148
Can I--all right, I just need
to get it out of the way.

16:23.232 --> 16:27.403
I'm a huge fan of yours
and, obviously, your husband.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.655
- Oh, my God!
<i>- I just am so happy that</i>

16:29.738 --> 16:32.700
you were willing to do this,
so I'm appreciative.

16:32.783 --> 16:35.577
- Of course, are you kidding?
I'm so excited to do it,

16:35.661 --> 16:38.122
and we're huge fans of yours.

16:38.205 --> 16:40.749
<i>Um--</i>
- I'm like, no, you're not.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.501
<i>- So, like,</i>
<i>I have a younger brother,</i>

16:42.584 --> 16:44.962
so I actually grew up
watching "Wizards."

16:45.045 --> 16:46.964
- Aww.
- Wow!

16:47.047 --> 16:48.924
<i>- I'm just gonna</i>
<i>throw that out there.</i>

16:49.007 --> 16:50.592
- Yay!
<i>- And so I've, like,</i>

16:50.676 --> 16:52.219
been a fan
for a very long time.

16:52.302 --> 16:53.929
- She's an OG.
- That's awesome.

16:54.012 --> 16:56.390
- Now my day is made, so...

16:56.473 --> 16:58.392
- Okay,
so just take that cheese.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.477
It's gonna be a little messy.
It's fine.

17:00.561 --> 17:03.147
<i>Stuff it in the center</i>
<i>of your date.</i>

17:03.230 --> 17:06.233
Tiny pinch of pepper
on top of that.

17:06.316 --> 17:08.485
- I'll help you.
- Thank you.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.155
- I think your prosciutto
is big like mine,

17:11.238 --> 17:13.073
so what I like to do

17:13.157 --> 17:16.118
is kind of break each sheet
in half lengthwise

17:16.201 --> 17:18.954
<i>so that we can ensure that</i>
<i>it gets crispy in the oven.</i>

17:19.038 --> 17:20.831
- Okay.
Uh-oh.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.249
Okay, well,
this one didn't work,

17:22.332 --> 17:24.042
so we're gonna go for this one.

17:24.126 --> 17:27.337
- And then you just wrap it
around the date tightly.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.256
<i>If we wrap it too much,</i>
<i>it kind of creates</i>

17:29.339 --> 17:30.966
<i>a little bit of moisture,</i>
<i>and then you don't get</i>

17:31.049 --> 17:33.677
that nice crispy
prosciutto action.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.512
- Oh!
I see.

17:35.596 --> 17:36.889
<i>- Perfect.</i>
<i>And then we're just--</i>

17:36.972 --> 17:38.223
literally,
just do the same thing

17:38.307 --> 17:40.726
over and over and over.
<i>- Okay.</i>

17:40.809 --> 17:42.269
- I've had bacon-wrapped dates.

17:42.352 --> 17:44.521
This is my first time
with prosciutto,

17:44.605 --> 17:45.898
and I'm really excited.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.983
This is probably
a bit healthier as well.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.818
- Mm.
Maybe not.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.321
<i>Maybe, maybe not.</i>
- I like telling myself that.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.615
- Mildly?
Maybe mildly healthier.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.658
We can pretend.
- [laughs]

17:56.742 --> 17:58.994
<i>- But</i>
<i>the prosciutto's so thin,</i>

17:59.077 --> 18:01.997
so I feel like it ensures
crispiness in the oven,

18:02.080 --> 18:03.540
which is--
we want that bite.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.251
- Yes.
<i>- So literally</i>

18:06.335 --> 18:07.795
<i>that is it for this.</i>

18:07.878 --> 18:10.047
What we're gonna do now
is pop it into that oven

18:10.130 --> 18:11.840
that's been heating up
for so long.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.259
<i>So 450, and it's only gonna be</i>
<i>eight to ten minutes,</i>

18:14.343 --> 18:15.928
<i>and these you should be able</i>

18:16.011 --> 18:17.137
to smell when it's ready.

18:17.221 --> 18:18.305
- Ooh.
<i>- And then we can</i>

18:18.388 --> 18:20.307
get into these sandwiches.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.351
- Okay.
- Oh, we can't wait.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.770
- So next,
we've gotta make a sauce

18:24.853 --> 18:26.688
for this hot honey
chicken sandwich,

18:26.772 --> 18:28.190
so we're gonna make
the hot honey sauce.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.359
- Wow.
- You just need

18:30.442 --> 18:32.945
to heat up a little sauce pot.

18:33.028 --> 18:34.238
- All righty.

18:34.321 --> 18:35.781
- Get two tablespoons

18:35.864 --> 18:39.117
of some unsalted butter
into the pot.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.912
- One tablespoon--here.
<i>- Dump it right in there.</i>

18:41.995 --> 18:43.455
- Got you.
- But if you--

18:43.539 --> 18:45.749
but on the butter,
I think this is already two,

18:45.833 --> 18:47.209
so you just cut that.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.336
- Why am I acting like this?
You do it.

18:49.419 --> 18:51.296
Are you sure that's not inches?

18:51.380 --> 18:53.131
- [laughs]
Inches.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.050
- I mean, I like butter.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.426
Thank you, Paigey.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.887
- And then you want
1/4 cup of honey.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.013
- 1/4 cup?
- And then

19:00.097 --> 19:02.182
1 1/2 tablespoons

19:02.266 --> 19:04.893
of your favorite hot sauce.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.396
- This is gonna be spicy.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.399
- Then we're gonna
get this on the stove now.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.109
<i>And you're just</i>
<i>gonna put it on low.</i>

19:12.192 --> 19:13.902
<i>And all we wanna do</i>
<i>is melt the butter</i>

19:13.986 --> 19:16.446
and get it mixed in with all
of the other ingredients.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.740
<i>So it should just</i>
<i>take a minute.</i>

19:18.824 --> 19:20.242
- All righty.

19:20.325 --> 19:23.120
- Let's give our dates a look.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.664
- Wow.
<i>- Incredible.</i>

19:25.747 --> 19:27.749
We can let them cool
just a little bit.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.585
- Our butter is all melted.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.420
<i>- Perfect,</i>
<i>so you can cut that heat.</i>

19:31.503 --> 19:35.173
Now we wanna grab the buns,
the lettuce, the pickles,

19:35.257 --> 19:37.301
and, if you please,
some mayonnaise.

19:37.384 --> 19:40.637
- Ooh, you definitely
want the mayonnaise, Selena.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.306
- I do.
- I know you.

19:42.389 --> 19:43.891
- Let's get just
a little skillet

19:43.974 --> 19:45.142
on medium heat.

19:45.225 --> 19:46.602
- Okay, little skillet.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.854
Where are you?
- [laughs]

19:48.937 --> 19:50.480
- Okey dokey.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.691
- We're just gonna spread
a little butter on each bun,

19:52.774 --> 19:54.985
and get it into the skillet
on medium heat.

19:55.068 --> 19:57.988
And it should take, like, two
minutes to toast these buns up.

19:58.071 --> 19:59.364
- Love that.
- What do you have

19:59.448 --> 20:00.949
on your feet?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.743
- What do I have?
- Mm-hmm.

20:02.826 --> 20:04.661
- Um, I have my slippers.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.288
They're Louis Vuitton.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.625
- So are mine!
all: No!

20:09.708 --> 20:12.044
- Yeah!
- Epic.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.212
- I knew we were meant to be.
- Louis girls!

20:14.296 --> 20:16.757
- So since some
of those buns are ready,

20:16.840 --> 20:18.592
put a little mayo
on both sides.

20:18.675 --> 20:22.262
<i>And then this,</i>
<i>I'm oddly particular about.</i>

20:22.346 --> 20:24.973
The lettuce needs to go
on the bottom bun.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.475
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

20:26.558 --> 20:29.061
- [laughs]
- I got you.

20:29.144 --> 20:30.354
- It has to.

20:30.437 --> 20:32.022
Okay, so now you want
to bring your pot

20:32.105 --> 20:34.816
over to your cutting board
that has your sauce in it.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.234
Take the chicken--
yup--and just, like...

20:36.318 --> 20:38.111
- Ooh.
- Slosh it around.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.321
Terrible word.

20:39.404 --> 20:40.697
- [chuckles]
- Slosh.

20:40.781 --> 20:43.742
- Flip it.
Get the other side.

20:43.825 --> 20:47.746
And then do a little tap,
tap, tap to get the excess off.

20:47.829 --> 20:49.915
And then right onto
that lettuce it goes.

20:49.998 --> 20:53.669
- Tap, tap, tap.
Onto the lettuce it goes!

20:53.752 --> 20:55.295
- Yum.
- It's lookin' so good!

20:55.379 --> 20:57.172
- Oh, my gosh.
- And then our pickles.

20:57.255 --> 20:59.424
You can pick
how many pickles you want.

20:59.508 --> 21:00.842
<i>- Selly, no pickles for me,</i>
<i>remember?</i>

21:00.926 --> 21:03.011
- Yep.
- I like two pickles.

21:03.095 --> 21:06.556
And then you put the top on
and you're good to go.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.518
- Presentation-wise,
this might be one of our best.

21:09.601 --> 21:12.729
- I'm so happy right now.
- Yay!

21:12.813 --> 21:14.189
<i>Have you tried the dates yet?</i>

21:14.272 --> 21:16.191
- Oh, no, we were waiting.
Shall we try?

21:16.274 --> 21:18.568
- Oh! I think so.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

21:18.652 --> 21:21.154
- All right, guys.
Let's start with this.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.197
- Yay!

21:22.280 --> 21:23.865
- It's our first bite!

21:23.949 --> 21:26.076
- Okay.
Moment of truth.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.995
- Mmm.
- Ah!

21:28.078 --> 21:30.372
- It's so good.

21:30.455 --> 21:32.708
<i>- Oh, my gosh.</i>
<i>- Wow!</i>

21:32.791 --> 21:36.503
- Um, I wasn't gonna say this,
but I'm not a fan of dates.

21:36.586 --> 21:38.880
This is unreal.
- It is good, yeah.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.340
- Oh, you like it!
Okay, good.

21:40.424 --> 21:43.093
- Mm-hmm.
It's so good.

21:43.176 --> 21:45.929
- This is so random.
Can I Facetime my girls

21:46.013 --> 21:47.639
so they can say hello?

21:47.723 --> 21:49.016
- Oh, my goodness.
I would love that.

21:49.099 --> 21:51.601
- Okay, they're in school
right now, but--

21:51.685 --> 21:53.854
- They, like, pulled her aside.

21:53.937 --> 21:56.565
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Hi!

21:56.648 --> 21:58.442
<i>- Hey, Mommy.</i>
<i>- Okay, somebody</i>

21:58.525 --> 21:59.901
<i>wants to say hi to you.</i>

21:59.985 --> 22:03.238
Tell me if you can see.
Here.

22:03.321 --> 22:06.700
Can you see?
Say hi.

22:06.783 --> 22:09.327
- Hi, guys!
Aww.

22:09.411 --> 22:12.164
[laughs]
Hi, guys!

22:12.247 --> 22:13.790
- They are so cute.

22:13.874 --> 22:16.251
- It's so nice to meet you!
- You gotta say something!

22:16.334 --> 22:17.669
- [laughs]

22:17.753 --> 22:19.588
<i>I'm getting to cook</i>
<i>with your mom.</i>

22:19.671 --> 22:21.798
I hope to meet you one day.

22:21.882 --> 22:24.593
[all laughing]

22:24.676 --> 22:26.053
- That is so cute.

22:26.136 --> 22:28.055
<i>- Is school going well?</i>

22:28.138 --> 22:30.140
Good job.
I'm proud of you.

22:30.223 --> 22:31.308
[laughs]

22:31.391 --> 22:33.351
- All right, girls.
Say bye.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.020
- Bye!

22:35.103 --> 22:36.271
[all laughing]

22:36.354 --> 22:38.565
- That was
the cutest thing ever.

22:38.648 --> 22:40.567
- Their hands are still
on their faces.

22:40.650 --> 22:43.862
Thank you for making me
the coolest mom ever today.

22:43.945 --> 22:45.822
- Oh, please.
That was so awesome.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.949
Thank you.
- We're missing one thing,

22:48.033 --> 22:49.451
though--
you have to try the sandwich.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.078
- No, you're totally right.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.954
So let's try this.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.790
- Sandwich time.

22:54.873 --> 22:57.209
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

22:57.292 --> 22:58.585
- All right, here we go.

22:58.668 --> 23:01.129
- Oh, the way the sauce
is dripping down.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.632
Mm.
- Oh, my gosh.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.133
<i>- Ugh!</i>
- [laughs]

23:05.217 --> 23:06.802
- Oh, my gosh!
- The best chicken sandwich

23:06.885 --> 23:08.220
I've ever had.
- This is so good!

23:08.303 --> 23:09.763
- It's so good.

23:09.846 --> 23:11.431
- While we eat this,
could you tell us

23:11.515 --> 23:13.642
a little bit
about your charity?

23:13.725 --> 23:16.812
- Yes!
So my husband and I

23:16.895 --> 23:19.731
started a nonprofit
called Eat, Learn, Play.

23:19.815 --> 23:23.026
<i>Really wrap our arms</i>
<i>around the Oakland youth.</i>

23:23.110 --> 23:26.154
<i>We provide quality education,</i>

23:26.238 --> 23:29.032
<i>quality nutrition,</i>
<i>and safe places to play,</i>

23:29.116 --> 23:31.326
<i>which we believe is</i>
<i>fundamental for every child.</i>

23:31.409 --> 23:34.287
And so it's kind of
our mission to make sure

23:34.371 --> 23:38.041
that we can be the village
for people that don't have one.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.585
<i>'Cause it really does take a</i>
<i>village to raise a kid, so...</i>

23:40.669 --> 23:42.337
- Absolutely.
I love that.

23:42.420 --> 23:45.382
<i>As a thank-you to Ayesha</i>
<i>for sharing her recipes today,</i>

23:45.465 --> 23:48.635

23:50.929 --> 23:53.014

And I love the Bay Area, so
we're gonna do it for the Bay.

23:58.436 --> 24:00.605
- Thank you, thank you!
<i>- Of course.</i>

24:00.689 --> 24:04.025
- And if you're ever in the
Bay and you wanna come eat...

24:04.109 --> 24:05.944
- Don't tell me that.
I'll be there tomorrow.

24:06.027 --> 24:07.445
<i>I'll be there.</i>
[all laughing]

24:07.529 --> 24:10.198
Thank you so, so, so much

24:10.282 --> 24:12.868
for showing us how to make the
most delicious chicken sandwich

24:12.951 --> 24:14.536
I probably ever have had.

24:14.619 --> 24:15.871
- Thank you!
<i>- Yes.</i>

24:15.954 --> 24:17.372
And I'm gonna
finish eating this

24:17.455 --> 24:19.875
and try to not look,
like, ugly while I eat.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.751
- [laughs]
- Never that, never that.

24:21.835 --> 24:23.253
- I hope you have a good day.
<i>- All right.</i>

24:23.336 --> 24:25.839
all: Bye!
- All right, bye, guys!

24:25.922 --> 24:27.174
- Whoo!
- Yay.

24:27.257 --> 24:28.675
- All right, here,
I'm gonna put mine

24:28.758 --> 24:32.596
on yours,
grab the tray, chickpeas.

24:32.679 --> 24:34.806
"Friends" reunion?
- Yes.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.016
- Duh.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.896
- Okay, here.
- Let's do it.

24:40.979 --> 24:43.565
- Okay.
Here for it.

24:43.648 --> 24:45.984
- Goin' straight
to the chicken sandwich.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.986
- Oh, my God.
- How would you rate it?

24:48.069 --> 24:51.406
- It's so good.
- You, as a fast-food lover,

24:51.489 --> 24:53.283
would you say
that this is better?

24:53.366 --> 24:54.618
- [laughs]
- Shh, shh.

24:54.701 --> 24:57.078
- People know.
- [chuckles]

24:57.162 --> 24:59.748
This is definitely better.
- It was easy to make too.

24:59.831 --> 25:01.750
I would rate the sandwich
a ten out of ten.

25:01.833 --> 25:02.918
- Yeah?
- For sure.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.294
- Mm-hmm.
- Agreed.

25:04.377 --> 25:06.338
- You need a--
mm-mm?

25:06.421 --> 25:07.505
- Huh.
- Mm.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.007
[both chuckling]

25:09.090 --> 25:10.258
- Thanks.
