-[indistinct female voice]
-[radio chatter]

00:08.617 --> 00:10.053
[female newscaster] Have you
heard this crazy story?

00:10.097 --> 00:11.402
[male newscaster] Up next.

00:11.446 --> 00:13.535
APR is under fire today--

00:13.578 --> 00:15.189
-[male newscaster 1] APR is--
-[male newscaster 2] APR--

00:15.232 --> 00:17.104
[male newscaster 3]
APR is under fire today

00:17.147 --> 00:20.063
for a recent interview
that went disturbingly south.

00:20.107 --> 00:21.891
[male newscaster 4]
...disturbingly south.

00:21.934 --> 00:25.242
[deep music]

00:50.833 --> 00:51.921
[Allen] Hey, Mark.

00:51.964 --> 00:53.966
Long time no see.

00:54.010 --> 00:55.490
Hi Allen.

00:55.533 --> 00:57.187
[Allen] How's
newfound fame been for you?

00:57.231 --> 00:59.146
You know, I was just talking
to my producer, Kim, here

00:59.189 --> 01:01.017
about how your episode

01:01.061 --> 01:03.280
was our
most downloaded to date.

01:03.324 --> 01:04.934
Oh, yeah... it--

01:06.066 --> 01:08.677
Things have been
strange, I guess.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.809
Cool, man.
Hey, hold on a second.

01:10.853 --> 01:13.073
And we will start
this live stream shortly.

01:13.551 --> 01:14.900
Okay.

01:15.684 --> 01:18.426
Hey, does he seem
off to you?

01:18.469 --> 01:20.341
-What do you mean?
-[Kim] I don't know.

01:20.384 --> 01:22.256
He just seems weirder from the
last time we interviewed him.

01:22.299 --> 01:24.171
Show's called
U.S. Sane,Kim,

01:24.214 --> 01:25.389
everyone we interview
is a little off.

01:25.433 --> 01:26.564
Remember,
that's the point.

01:40.535 --> 01:42.276
[podcast announcer]
This is U.S. Sane.

01:42.319 --> 01:44.626
Hello, all
you crazies out there.

01:44.669 --> 01:46.193
Allen here.

01:46.236 --> 01:49.109
This is a special
live edition of U.S. Sane.

01:49.631 --> 01:52.895
We're steering away
from our normal podcast format

01:52.938 --> 01:56.159
to bring you this
special live update episode.

01:56.203 --> 01:58.030
You all
remember my friend, Mark

01:58.074 --> 02:01.121
from our Halloween episode
titled, "Follower."

02:01.686 --> 02:03.558
Please stop now if you
haven't checked it out yet,

02:03.601 --> 02:07.344
it's definitely
our spookiest episode to date.

02:07.388 --> 02:08.606
Yeah.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.434
[Allen] So, Mark,

02:10.478 --> 02:12.828
you emailed us stating you
have an update to your story?

02:12.871 --> 02:14.873
I do, Allen.

02:14.917 --> 02:20.096
First, briefly remind
our listeners about your story.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.143
Well. [grunting softly]

02:23.186 --> 02:24.274
Allen, I...

02:28.104 --> 02:30.106
A few years ago,

02:30.150 --> 02:31.934
I started noticing this

02:31.977 --> 02:34.241
shadowy figure
that followed me around.

02:34.850 --> 02:37.635
Yeah, yeah, and I--
I think what we all found

02:37.679 --> 02:40.508
the creepiest about it,
about the whole thing,

02:40.551 --> 02:43.206
is that
this so-called follower

02:43.250 --> 02:46.035
actually appeared
in some of your photos.

02:46.078 --> 02:49.038
I-- You know,
I think I actually have one.

02:50.561 --> 02:52.389
[Mark]
I really want to, uh,

02:52.433 --> 02:56.132
I really want to thank you
for all of your help.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.266
Ever since
you interviewed me...

02:59.309 --> 03:01.746
I've received countless
emails from people...

03:01.790 --> 03:03.400
[exhales heavily]

03:03.444 --> 03:04.967
...just giving me
their theories and...

03:07.230 --> 03:10.233
just comforting me with kind
words of encouragement.

03:10.277 --> 03:13.149
That's great.
That's great to hear, Mark.

03:13.628 --> 03:17.240
So, you have
an update for us?

03:17.284 --> 03:19.851
Yeah.
I do, Allen.[laughs]

03:22.071 --> 03:23.681
A week ago, I...

03:24.943 --> 03:26.641
actually... [nervous laugh]

03:26.684 --> 03:28.469
...finally found
this follower,

03:28.512 --> 03:31.298
and I-- I currently have him
trapped in my basement.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.170
Excuse me, what?

03:36.520 --> 03:38.043
Would you like
to see him?

03:38.870 --> 03:41.264
Uh, hold on a second, Mark.
You did what?

03:41.308 --> 03:43.135
Here, here, just--
Let me show you.

03:44.311 --> 03:47.618
[deep music]

03:54.886 --> 03:57.280
[deep music continues]

03:59.282 --> 04:01.066
[female voice]
Mark? Hello?

04:01.110 --> 04:02.807
-Can anybody hear me?
-Uh, Mark? Mark, Mark!

04:02.851 --> 04:04.331
-Let's uh--
-[female voice] Mark!

04:04.374 --> 04:05.767
[Allen] Let's--

04:05.810 --> 04:06.898
[Mark]
I finally confronted him.

04:06.942 --> 04:08.596
Like they told me to.

04:08.639 --> 04:09.988
-Who-- Who told you?
-[woman shouting indistinctly]

04:10.032 --> 04:11.425
[Mark] Our fans.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.296
[woman shouting]
Can anybody hear me?

04:13.340 --> 04:14.645
I need you
to listen to me, Mark.

04:15.298 --> 04:17.257
Everything's
going to be okay.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.216
Whoever you have

04:20.260 --> 04:22.131
is not...

04:23.219 --> 04:24.394
the follower.

04:24.438 --> 04:26.091
[woman] We can help you.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.442
I'm just done.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.835
[woman] Hello? Mark?

04:30.879 --> 04:32.533
Mark,
why are you doing this?

04:32.576 --> 04:34.186
Mark, please let me out.

04:34.230 --> 04:35.840
[breathes heavily]

04:35.884 --> 04:37.712
I finally got
what I wanted.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.191
Listen, Mark--

04:39.235 --> 04:40.280
I've already called
the police on myself.

04:42.586 --> 04:43.544
I-- I know...

04:45.328 --> 04:46.416
[whimpering] I--

04:46.460 --> 04:47.635
I know that--

04:49.376 --> 04:50.986
I have to be
the one to stop this.

04:51.029 --> 04:52.422
-[woman continuing to cry out]
-[Allen] Mark.

04:52.466 --> 04:53.902
Please stop.

04:55.033 --> 04:57.906
Don't--
Uh, don't do anything stupid!

04:57.949 --> 05:00.343
This story
needs the ending it deserves.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.040
-[Allen] Mark!
-[officer] Police, open up!

05:02.084 --> 05:04.347
Stop this!

05:04.391 --> 05:06.044
-[officer] Come out, now!
-[Allen] Mark?

05:07.568 --> 05:09.004
Come back.

05:09.047 --> 05:10.484
-Come back.
-[officer] Open up!

05:10.527 --> 05:11.876
[Allen] Stop this.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.008
Mark?

05:13.051 --> 05:14.705
Shit!

05:14.749 --> 05:16.620
[officer] He's got a gun!

05:16.664 --> 05:18.622
-[Allen] Come back, come back.
-[officer] Put the gun down.

05:18.666 --> 05:20.363
-[Allen] Mark, Mark, stop this.
-[officer] Put the gun down.

05:25.020 --> 05:28.110
[Allen] Hello, everyone,
and welcome back

05:28.153 --> 05:31.200
to U.S. Sane,
on American Public Radio,

05:31.243 --> 05:32.767
the show
where we interview...

05:33.898 --> 05:36.553
strange people
doing grand things.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.382
I'm your host,
Allen Wolfe.

05:40.688 --> 05:42.559
Everyone
who works with me

05:42.603 --> 05:44.605
knows I keep
a box in my office...

05:46.389 --> 05:48.304
full of letters
from potential guests

05:48.348 --> 05:50.393
asking if they can
be on the show.

05:52.613 --> 05:54.136
Usually,
I get about a hundred a week.

05:55.442 --> 05:56.965
I get a--
I get an email,

05:57.008 --> 05:59.010
I print it out,
and I put it in the box.

06:03.101 --> 06:05.365
Mark's letter
sat in that box for...

06:06.540 --> 06:09.369
months before I decided
to interview him.

06:10.805 --> 06:13.198
I never should have interviewed
Mark the first time,

06:13.242 --> 06:14.548
let alone a second.

06:16.419 --> 06:18.465
I ignored my gut
telling me not to

06:18.508 --> 06:20.075
for the sake
of entertainment.

06:21.859 --> 06:24.122
I failed you, listeners.

06:35.786 --> 06:37.179
How bad is this?

06:37.832 --> 06:39.790
I mean, how much should
I expect to get sued for?

06:40.269 --> 06:43.403
Did you even mean anything
that you said earlier

06:43.446 --> 06:45.492
about failing
the listeners?

06:46.231 --> 06:48.799
Mr. Franklin
would like to see you.

06:50.845 --> 06:53.195
[female newscaster] In an
effort to distance themselves

06:53.238 --> 06:56.459
fromU.S. Sane's
reckless interview style,

06:56.503 --> 07:01.116
APR has already
parted ways with Allen Wolfe.

07:01.159 --> 07:02.552
[female newscaster 2]
American Public Radio

07:02.596 --> 07:04.293
released
a statement saying, quote,

07:04.336 --> 07:06.948
"As we continue with our
internal investigation

07:06.991 --> 07:09.167
regarding Mr. Wolfe's
reckless actions,

07:09.211 --> 07:10.604
our thoughts and prayers

07:10.647 --> 07:12.388
go out to Mr. Bowers' family.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.869
Here at APR, no one's life
should ever be put

07:14.912 --> 07:16.914
in harm's way
for an interview.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.481
[female newscaster 1]
Police are still investigating

07:18.525 --> 07:21.223
how exactly
this event transpired.

07:21.266 --> 07:23.007
[male newscaster 1]
Bowers could be seen

07:23.051 --> 07:25.053
on the livestream
talking about having someone

07:25.096 --> 07:27.142
locked in his basement.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.057
[male newscaster 2] At first,
some thought this was a hoax.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.189
[female newscaster 1] However,
it quickly became clear

07:31.233 --> 07:33.714
that this was real.

07:33.757 --> 07:36.194
[emotional music]

07:36.238 --> 07:40.460
â™ª

07:46.727 --> 07:48.119
[sighs]

07:48.163 --> 07:51.993
[suspenseful music]

07:52.036 --> 07:54.517
[crickets chirping]

07:56.563 --> 07:57.694
[Kim]
Is everything okay?

07:58.173 --> 08:00.784
Oh, yeah.
As good as things can be.

08:05.223 --> 08:07.356
Do you want to...
talk about it?

08:08.226 --> 08:10.272
[Allen sobbing]

08:10.315 --> 08:11.969
Aw, it's okay.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.580
-It's okay.
-[Allen sobbing]

08:14.363 --> 08:16.583
-[sobbing continuing]
-Oh, Jesus.

08:17.105 --> 08:19.324
I guess that's one place
you can keep your awards.

08:19.368 --> 08:21.588
I may move them
to the shallow end.

08:23.241 --> 08:24.547
Who knows?

08:25.809 --> 08:28.551
-Thought you might want this.
-I don't, thanks.

08:30.161 --> 08:32.337
I don't want
anything to do with this.

08:34.122 --> 08:35.297
Okay.

08:36.254 --> 08:38.692
You're going to make it
to the end of this.

08:38.735 --> 08:40.302
It isn't going
to be a smooth ride,

08:41.346 --> 08:43.348
but you will,
and when you do,

08:43.392 --> 08:45.002
you're going to need
a redeeming story.

08:45.046 --> 08:47.701
And maybe,
just maybe, your redemption

08:47.744 --> 08:49.267
is in that box.

08:52.183 --> 08:54.055
Okay, we have a P.O. box.

08:54.098 --> 08:55.535
[Allen] Ooh.

08:56.144 --> 08:59.451
Mine is from some lady,
named Josie.

08:59.495 --> 09:02.629
Claims her birdfeeder
is haunted by--

09:02.672 --> 09:04.065
Oh, my God.
Allen.

09:06.894 --> 09:08.025
Listen to this.

09:09.940 --> 09:11.463
"Dear Mr. Wolfe.

09:11.986 --> 09:13.770
My name is Don Thomas.

09:13.814 --> 09:15.555
Before my wife Jean died,

09:15.598 --> 09:17.687
she would listen
to your program every week.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.081
She was a huge fan.

09:20.124 --> 09:21.604
[Kim exhaling]

09:21.648 --> 09:22.997
I, on the other hand,
find you annoying."

09:23.040 --> 09:25.042
Great.
That's great, Kim, trash it.

09:25.086 --> 09:27.131
"With that said,

09:27.175 --> 09:29.394
I think I have something
living in the woods

09:29.438 --> 09:32.049
near my house that might
pique your interest.

09:32.093 --> 09:34.443
What I'm asking you
to help me with is dangerous.

09:34.486 --> 09:38.578
So I've attached a check
for $25,000--

09:38.621 --> 09:40.623
Holy shit.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.104
There it is. Okay.

09:43.147 --> 09:44.627
[chuckling]

09:44.671 --> 09:47.369
"In the woods
near my house lives a beast

09:47.412 --> 09:48.762
with a thousand eyes.

09:48.805 --> 09:50.720
If you meet me
at my P.O. Box,

09:50.764 --> 09:52.853
I will take you
to the beast and kill it.

09:52.896 --> 09:55.507
A hell of a story awaits
for you if you accept my offer.

09:55.551 --> 09:57.292
I'll sign the check
if you accept it.

09:57.335 --> 09:59.163
-Are you in?
-[Allen scoffs]

10:00.687 --> 10:02.253
Jean would have
wanted this.

10:02.950 --> 10:04.560
P.S.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.170
I'll be at the post office
in Hobart, Oklahoma

10:06.214 --> 10:07.476
every Wednesday.

10:07.519 --> 10:09.260
If you show up,
I'll pick you up.

10:09.696 --> 10:12.568
I have no phone,
so it has to be this way.

10:13.656 --> 10:16.311
I can't promise you that
I won't have killed the beast

10:16.354 --> 10:17.791
by the time
you answer either."

10:18.574 --> 10:20.794
Signed, D.T.

10:23.710 --> 10:24.928
[scoffs]

10:29.716 --> 10:31.239
What do you think?

10:31.282 --> 10:33.894
First of all,
a monster sounds like

10:33.937 --> 10:35.896
fairy tale
fantasy bullshit.

10:36.461 --> 10:37.898
You're not seeing
the real story here.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.377
Which is?

10:39.421 --> 10:40.901
That you would be
interviewing

10:40.944 --> 10:42.859
a recently widowed man

10:42.903 --> 10:45.688
who's making his dead wife's
dying wish a reality,

10:45.732 --> 10:48.082
which is to hang out
with Allen Wolfe.

10:48.125 --> 10:50.650
-[laughs]
-Her favorite host.

10:51.172 --> 10:54.828
The recently fired,
internationally acclaimed

10:54.871 --> 10:57.526
podcast host,
all while monster hunting!

10:58.309 --> 11:01.225
When you say it like that,
it sounds decently poetic.

11:01.791 --> 11:03.314
Listen,
it's your call.

11:03.837 --> 11:05.708
You can also just
sit here and do nothing.

11:10.104 --> 11:12.889
Perfect chance to have
a kick ass comeback story.

11:15.413 --> 11:18.373
APR'll be begging
to have you back.

11:27.121 --> 11:28.209
Okay.

11:28.818 --> 11:30.515
-Okay.
-Really?

11:31.038 --> 11:33.127
Yeah, it's the perfect way
to get my mind off

11:33.170 --> 11:35.695
a potential
lawsuit with APR.

11:35.738 --> 11:38.349
[Allen scoffing]
Hobart, Oklahoma?

11:39.046 --> 11:40.264
Here we come.

11:40.308 --> 11:41.701
[Kim chuckling]

11:41.744 --> 11:43.267
[laughs]

11:43.311 --> 11:47.358
[ambient music]

11:55.453 --> 11:57.673
[ambient music continues]

11:57.717 --> 12:04.680
â™ª

12:30.837 --> 12:33.317
As I sit here...

12:33.361 --> 12:36.407
waiting to see
if this Don Thomas does show,

12:36.451 --> 12:40.150
or even exist I question...

12:42.196 --> 12:43.806
"What am I doing here?"

12:43.850 --> 12:46.635
[ambient music]

12:48.289 --> 12:50.378
[exhaling]

12:50.421 --> 12:51.814
[trilling lips]

12:51.858 --> 12:53.033
[deep breathing]

12:54.077 --> 12:55.992
Yes, his letter said
to be at this

12:56.036 --> 12:57.864
post office on Wednesday.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.302
And yes,
it is in fact, Wednesday.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.521
However,

13:03.565 --> 13:06.176
as I sit here,
it hits me.

13:07.221 --> 13:10.659
Just how naiÃ¯ve am I
to believe that--

13:13.705 --> 13:15.751
-Yes?
-Check.

13:17.840 --> 13:18.885
Check what?

13:26.806 --> 13:28.982
It's-- it's fine.
I-- I don't actually--

13:29.025 --> 13:31.027
Follow me
in my green truck.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.208
What green truck?

13:41.168 --> 13:43.300
-[Kim] How'd it go?
-Hey, so I met our guy.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.041
[Kim]
Awesome. How is he?

13:45.085 --> 13:46.695
He's not
the friendliest.

13:46.738 --> 13:48.175
[Kim through static]
I'm sorry. What?

13:48.218 --> 13:49.698
You're breaking up
a little bit.

13:49.741 --> 13:51.918
-He's not the friendliest.
-[Kim] Wha--

13:51.961 --> 13:53.745
In fact,
if I end up disappearing,

13:53.789 --> 13:55.791
well, it was
probably him.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.401
[Kim] Allen,
I can't hear anything.

13:57.445 --> 13:58.750
[line beeping]

14:01.928 --> 14:05.148
Cool.
Into no man's land.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.765
[indicator ticking]

14:16.768 --> 14:17.944
Everything good?

14:17.987 --> 14:19.293
Grab your stuff.

14:19.336 --> 14:21.208
This is where
you come with me.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.471
Your car'll be fine
parked here.

14:24.167 --> 14:25.429
Where are we?

14:25.473 --> 14:27.301
Here,
put this blindfold on

14:27.344 --> 14:28.824
and get in the back
of my truck.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.478
What?

14:30.521 --> 14:32.175
I can't let you see
where I live.

14:32.219 --> 14:34.917
I-- I'm going to need
more information than that.

14:34.961 --> 14:37.093
I don't owe you anything.

14:37.137 --> 14:39.356
I didn't force you
to come here.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.011
I offered you my story
and you accepted.

14:42.055 --> 14:43.491
Now you're here.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.362
You'll do as I say.

14:47.147 --> 14:48.452
No. [scoffs]

14:49.149 --> 14:51.238
I'm sorry, I'm not
going with you blindfolded.

14:51.281 --> 14:52.935
You're wasting my time!

14:55.111 --> 14:56.199
Wait.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.334
Look, I don't like you.

15:00.377 --> 15:01.770
I hate your show.

15:02.379 --> 15:03.859
I find you...

15:03.903 --> 15:05.774
smug,
and I don't believe

15:05.817 --> 15:07.907
any of that empathy
you shit out on the air.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.169
Other people do,
but I don't.

15:09.212 --> 15:11.127
I see
right through your act.

15:11.171 --> 15:12.824
My act?

15:12.868 --> 15:15.349
You're an entertainer,
and that's it.

15:17.133 --> 15:18.700
All you care about
is telling stories

15:18.743 --> 15:20.006
and getting more people
to listen to you.

15:22.269 --> 15:23.792
Forget this.

15:23.835 --> 15:26.577
I didn't drive to the middle
of nowhere to get attacked.

15:26.621 --> 15:28.275
Yeah, good! Leave!

15:28.318 --> 15:30.233
My story's
too good for you anyway.

15:31.669 --> 15:32.757
Okay.

15:34.368 --> 15:35.935
You really think
you have me figured out?

15:38.024 --> 15:40.591
Let me explain this
so you can understand.

15:42.419 --> 15:44.030
'Course I do
what I do for views.

15:44.726 --> 15:46.858
I would be a legit
crazy person if I made a show

15:46.902 --> 15:48.208
no one wanted
to listen to.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.298
You think
I got where I am

15:51.341 --> 15:53.169
by not caring
about my listeners?

15:54.736 --> 15:56.651
I have my show
because I care about--

15:56.694 --> 15:57.957
Had.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.480
Excuse me?

15:59.523 --> 16:01.786
You had your show.

16:02.483 --> 16:04.354
Last I saw,
you don't anymore.

16:05.486 --> 16:07.618
So, yeah,
I don't like you,

16:08.271 --> 16:10.056
but my wife
really did.

16:10.099 --> 16:12.754
Because of that,
and only that,

16:12.797 --> 16:15.061
I think it's fitting that you
be the one to tell my story.

16:16.366 --> 16:19.369
So I am not here
to be your friend

16:19.413 --> 16:22.111
or to hold your hand.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.158
If I can get my wife's
favorite show back,

16:26.028 --> 16:27.464
that's what
I'm going to do.

16:27.508 --> 16:29.553
And I believe
that my story can do that.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.208
It's up to you.

16:40.303 --> 16:41.870
[Don grunts]

16:43.089 --> 16:45.743
[suspenseful music]

17:02.238 --> 17:06.155
[suspenseful music continues]

17:15.860 --> 17:17.949
I'm currently
in the back of this truck.

17:19.299 --> 17:20.387
Blindfolded.

17:21.344 --> 17:23.346
Not a clue
where I'm going.

17:24.304 --> 17:28.482
â™ª

17:28.525 --> 17:31.354
Anything for
a good story, right?

17:31.920 --> 17:34.792
â™ª

17:34.836 --> 17:37.665
Ah, I just hope
I haven't made a mistake.

17:37.708 --> 17:44.759
â™ª

17:44.802 --> 17:46.717
â™ª

17:46.761 --> 17:47.892
[Don] Okay.

17:58.425 --> 18:01.384
Why do you have a P.O. Box
if you have a mailbox?

18:03.691 --> 18:05.780
Why would I want people
to know where I live?

18:06.868 --> 18:08.652
Grab your shit
and follow me.

18:08.696 --> 18:10.306
I'll show you
where you'll be sleeping.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.270
To your left.

18:27.454 --> 18:29.108
Make yourself comfortable.

18:41.032 --> 18:42.295
Here's a towel.

18:44.253 --> 18:45.385
Cool.

18:47.691 --> 18:48.823
I know it ain't much...

18:49.519 --> 18:50.738
but it'll do.

18:51.956 --> 18:53.262
Let me know
when you get settled.

18:53.306 --> 18:54.437
I'll show you around.

19:03.533 --> 19:04.752
You hungry?

19:05.274 --> 19:06.362
I'm good.

19:10.845 --> 19:12.890
Thought you said in your letter
you don't have a phone.

19:14.544 --> 19:15.676
I don't.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.461
That one's hooked
directly to the shed.

19:19.854 --> 19:21.464
Jean used to use it
to let me know

19:21.508 --> 19:22.987
when supper was ready.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.213
I'm just going to point out
the elephant in the room.

19:34.434 --> 19:35.957
Why is this house empty?

19:37.088 --> 19:40.309
I decided to downsize
after Jean died.

19:41.919 --> 19:43.791
I don't like clutter.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.185
I mean, there has
to be a limit to--

19:46.228 --> 19:49.623
-You like the Twilight Zone?
-Like the show?

19:49.666 --> 19:52.756
My uncle was a set decorator
on the Twilight Zone.

19:53.322 --> 19:56.020
He gave me this
when I was much younger.

19:56.586 --> 19:59.198
It was prop
in a famous episode.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.721
What episode?

20:01.548 --> 20:02.636
Does that matter?

20:03.767 --> 20:05.682
I just thought
it was interesting.

20:07.467 --> 20:08.946
Cool.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.992
Let's get going,
shall we?

20:13.386 --> 20:16.258
Ah, don't touch
that switch.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.433
You got it?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.131
Okay.

20:25.789 --> 20:27.095
[sighs]

20:27.138 --> 20:29.097
[Don] Two things
we need to get straight.

20:29.140 --> 20:31.230
First,
no cell phones.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.275
Why?

20:33.319 --> 20:35.146
I don't want you knowing
my location, that's why.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.148
I don't get service
out here.

20:37.192 --> 20:38.585
[grumbles]

20:38.628 --> 20:39.890
This is stupid,
I couldn't get maps out--

20:39.934 --> 20:41.022
-The quicker that you--
-Fine.

20:42.284 --> 20:43.851
I'll give it
back to you before you leave.

20:43.894 --> 20:45.548
I assume
you planned on giving it back.

20:45.592 --> 20:47.158
The second thing
you need to know

20:47.202 --> 20:49.726
is that this entire place...

20:50.945 --> 20:52.338
is boobytrapped.

20:52.816 --> 20:54.644
So, now
you got the basics.

20:55.123 --> 20:56.777
Hold on,
boobytrapped?

20:59.345 --> 21:00.694
Like, homemade
bombs and shit?

21:01.477 --> 21:02.957
Some of 'em, yes.

21:05.089 --> 21:06.177
Are you telling me this--

21:06.743 --> 21:08.441
this place contains

21:08.484 --> 21:11.835
random things that could
kill me?

21:12.358 --> 21:14.360
How is that the second most
important thing to tell me?

21:15.317 --> 21:17.101
Just don't flip
that switch inside,

21:17.145 --> 21:18.364
and you'll be fine.

21:18.407 --> 21:20.627
Keep in mind
that if it is red,

21:20.670 --> 21:22.193
you could be dead.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.631
Just stay with me.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.981
You'll be fine.
Oh, and here.

21:27.416 --> 21:29.418
If the shit
hits the fan,

21:29.462 --> 21:30.854
I wrote up
a set of guidelines

21:30.898 --> 21:31.986
for you to follow.

21:32.769 --> 21:34.075
-Follow?
-Yeah.

21:34.118 --> 21:37.296
So, you don't get
blown up and shit.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.950
D-- don't worry about it.

21:39.994 --> 21:41.430
I'll show you
where most of them are.

21:43.084 --> 21:44.520
The ones I remember anyway.

21:44.564 --> 21:46.522
There are ones
you forgot about?

21:46.566 --> 21:50.265
Ugh, damn stray cats
keep knocking my shit over.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.186
[Don grumbling]

22:08.805 --> 22:10.938
[chime sounding]

22:12.287 --> 22:15.116
This is where I build
all my traps.

22:15.159 --> 22:17.074
Can you elaborate
on the traps?

22:17.118 --> 22:18.946
Elaborate how?

22:19.860 --> 22:22.428
I don't know.
Why are there traps?

22:22.471 --> 22:25.735
There's a giant beast
that lives in the woods.

22:26.214 --> 22:28.521
My plan is
to lure it to my house,

22:28.564 --> 22:30.305
trap it and kill it.

22:36.267 --> 22:37.399
[Don grunting]

22:37.443 --> 22:38.835
Is this a trap?

22:39.749 --> 22:42.056
No.
Why would you think that?

22:42.099 --> 22:43.231
I don't know,
I mean-- It looks--

22:43.274 --> 22:44.363
What is wrong with you?

22:52.371 --> 22:56.940
[Don mumbling absentmindedly]

23:00.466 --> 23:03.947
[mysterious music]

23:11.477 --> 23:12.956
You know,

23:13.000 --> 23:14.828
for a guy
who doesn't like clutter,

23:14.871 --> 23:16.438
this place
says differently.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.875
One thing you'll find out
about me, Allen,

23:18.919 --> 23:22.139
everything I have around me
at any particular moment

23:22.183 --> 23:25.491
is there
for a very specific purpose.

23:27.362 --> 23:29.799
[sparks crackling]

23:29.843 --> 23:31.453
So, Don,

23:31.497 --> 23:33.020
you promised
in your letter

23:33.063 --> 23:34.674
I was going to see

23:34.717 --> 23:36.415
the monster
you were hunting.

23:36.980 --> 23:39.026
Well, yeah...

23:40.984 --> 23:42.464
I ain't no artist.

23:44.118 --> 23:45.554
But I sketched this...

23:46.512 --> 23:48.644
the last time I saw

23:48.688 --> 23:50.037
Eye.

23:51.821 --> 23:54.128
-Eye?
-That's what I call her.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.264
[sighs]

24:01.788 --> 24:03.790
I remember
the first time I saw her.

24:04.660 --> 24:05.792
She was...

24:06.793 --> 24:08.272
beautiful...

24:10.057 --> 24:11.232
in some way I...

24:12.102 --> 24:13.930
can't really describe.

24:15.845 --> 24:19.458
[screaming]

24:21.764 --> 24:24.027
I can't wait
to kill her.

24:35.604 --> 24:37.214
Man,

24:37.258 --> 24:39.042
I think it's funny
you wrote your letter to me

24:39.086 --> 24:40.261
on a greeting card.

24:41.131 --> 24:42.393
Why is that funny?

24:45.484 --> 24:47.311
You're an interesting guy,
Don, but...

24:47.355 --> 24:48.965
[coughs]

24:49.009 --> 24:50.271
...I don't take you
for the greeting card type.

24:50.750 --> 24:51.838
They were Jean's.

24:53.143 --> 24:54.841
She had
a bunch of 'em left over.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.278
She was
the kind of person that cared

24:57.321 --> 24:58.845
when nobody else did.

25:00.194 --> 25:01.891
I'm just trying
to get rid of them.

25:10.378 --> 25:11.466
Huh.

25:13.468 --> 25:15.731
Everybody needs
a plan B.

25:16.427 --> 25:18.821
That thing doesn't look like
it's been fired in years.

25:18.865 --> 25:19.909
Trust me.

25:20.475 --> 25:21.607
She's old,

25:21.650 --> 25:23.217
but she'll still
get the job done.

25:24.740 --> 25:27.351
Oh, hey,
before I forget.

25:29.919 --> 25:31.007
[Don grunting]

25:35.359 --> 25:36.491
What is it?

25:37.144 --> 25:39.755
No, no.
What is it?

25:40.495 --> 25:41.801
It's bait.

25:44.064 --> 25:45.805
It's got a bell
on the other end.

25:47.458 --> 25:49.548
There's two kinds of people
in this world, Allen.

25:50.113 --> 25:52.986
Those that wait
and those that can't anymore.

25:53.552 --> 25:54.683
[Don grunting]

25:54.727 --> 25:56.729
This beast
took my cattle,

25:56.772 --> 25:59.601
I am done
waiting on this fucker.

26:02.212 --> 26:04.214
Monster
took my livestock,

26:04.258 --> 26:05.999
cancer took my wife.

26:07.653 --> 26:08.784
[grunting]

26:08.828 --> 26:10.351
You do the math,

26:10.394 --> 26:12.135
I've got
nothing left to lose.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.269
-[Don grunts]
-What is that?

26:16.966 --> 26:19.273
It is time to do
some monster huntin'.

26:20.535 --> 26:21.580
Monster hunting?

26:22.189 --> 26:23.277
What does that entail?

26:42.644 --> 26:44.733
This thing
starts beeping,

26:44.777 --> 26:46.082
you just follow me?

26:47.606 --> 26:49.172
Follow you?

26:49.216 --> 26:50.434
What would you be doing
if that starts beeping?

26:51.653 --> 26:53.612
Running like hell
back to the house.

27:03.099 --> 27:04.884
So I saw
you had a horse.

27:04.927 --> 27:06.015
Do you ride?

27:11.760 --> 27:14.328
My family had horses
in Agoura Hills growing up.

27:15.372 --> 27:16.504
Horse ain't mine.

27:17.853 --> 27:20.464
It just showed up one day
and wouldn't leave.

27:21.248 --> 27:23.293
I decided
to build a fence around it

27:23.337 --> 27:24.947
so it wouldn't get hit
by a car or truck.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.602
I don't give
two shits about that horse.

27:28.081 --> 27:29.169
Gotcha.

27:40.571 --> 27:42.051
So what's
the plan here, Don?

27:42.095 --> 27:43.096
-'Cause right now--
-You know what, Allen?

27:43.139 --> 27:44.663
You talk too much.

27:45.272 --> 27:46.882
Let's try
not for a while.

27:47.622 --> 27:50.669
You do realize I'm interviewing
you for a podcast, right?

27:50.712 --> 27:53.323
I don't care how you choose
to tell the story.

28:18.914 --> 28:20.046
No luck today.

28:21.569 --> 28:23.223
I'm going to bed.

28:23.266 --> 28:24.354
What?

28:24.398 --> 28:25.486
[Don grunts]

28:28.184 --> 28:29.446
[Allen sighing]

28:46.159 --> 28:47.551
I'm here now...

28:48.770 --> 28:49.858
on the farm.

28:51.164 --> 28:52.252
Alone.

28:55.037 --> 28:56.125
Don--

28:58.562 --> 29:00.086
Don called it
a day and...

29:01.174 --> 29:02.305
he's asleep now.

29:05.700 --> 29:06.832
He's very--

29:08.659 --> 29:10.096
There's something
about him, I can't--

29:13.882 --> 29:15.405
I can't tell
if he's lying...

29:16.711 --> 29:18.800
to me,
he's lying to himself,

29:18.844 --> 29:20.541
if he believes
all of this.

29:21.063 --> 29:22.151
It's so weird.

29:24.110 --> 29:25.198
It's creepy in here.

29:25.807 --> 29:28.027
All the walls
are empty.

29:30.290 --> 29:32.031
He claims
it's boobytrapped.

29:37.384 --> 29:39.038
[sighing] Well,

29:39.081 --> 29:41.562
there's not really
anything more to do here.

29:42.519 --> 29:43.607
So...

29:44.521 --> 29:45.696
calling it a night.

29:47.394 --> 29:48.917
Day one on the farm.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.007
[TV characters] Mildred, dear.

29:52.051 --> 29:53.879
You're not well.

29:53.922 --> 29:56.098
Now, take your medicine
like Dr. Hellinger prescribed.

29:56.142 --> 29:57.578
Oh, Nick.

29:57.621 --> 29:59.232
You talk
and you talk,

29:59.275 --> 30:01.321
but you're just like
the rest of them.

30:01.364 --> 30:03.584
I don't have
to listen to you, Mick.

30:03.627 --> 30:04.977
You know why?

30:05.020 --> 30:07.457
'Cause you're a--
you're a--

30:07.501 --> 30:08.676
well, you're a moth!

30:12.201 --> 30:14.334

Stay where you are.

30:14.377 --> 30:16.249
You're watching

33:07.942 --> 33:09.074
Morning, Don.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.077
The horse is gone.

33:13.078 --> 33:14.470
[Don] Yeah. I saw.

33:15.732 --> 33:18.257
Well, I guess it's good
you didn't get attached, huh?

33:21.564 --> 33:22.696
Hey, is there any--

[emotional music]

33:32.749 --> 33:34.142
Today's going to be
the day, Allen.

33:34.186 --> 33:35.404
I can feel it.

33:35.448 --> 33:41.323
â™ª

33:45.980 --> 33:47.590
[Allen] As I sit here...

33:48.591 --> 33:49.810
in silence.

33:51.377 --> 33:52.682
I look at Don...

33:53.901 --> 33:55.424
and I wonder...

33:56.251 --> 33:58.123
what led him
to this point?

33:59.863 --> 34:01.387
Is the monster
even real?

34:03.954 --> 34:05.304
Or is Don lying?

34:06.870 --> 34:10.135
Is this just
one big joke?

34:11.397 --> 34:13.529
Even if the monster
showed up now...

34:14.356 --> 34:16.358
Don is sound asleep.

34:18.099 --> 34:19.318
He almost looks dead.

34:22.147 --> 34:23.235
Don?

34:26.847 --> 34:27.935
Don?

34:32.374 --> 34:34.550
-Don?
-I need to shit!

35:14.242 --> 35:16.114
[Allen] I'm not sure
how much time has passed.

35:17.854 --> 35:20.466
Don has disappeared.

35:21.989 --> 35:23.077
I'm sitting--

35:23.599 --> 35:25.123
No, that's stupid.

I'm sitting here.

35:48.058 --> 35:49.538
Not knowing
what to do.

Still, no Eye.

37:40.780 --> 37:41.955
What?

37:41.998 --> 37:43.565
[Don wheezing]

37:43.609 --> 37:44.871
What?

37:44.914 --> 37:46.264
We got visitors, Allen.

37:47.134 --> 37:48.744
I think
they're here for Eye.

37:48.788 --> 37:50.485
I ran off somebody
in a hazmat suit

37:50.529 --> 37:52.226
and he dropped
his walkie-talkie.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.575
What?

37:53.619 --> 37:55.273
I think this is bigger
than we thought!

37:56.404 --> 37:57.579
How big are we talking?

37:57.623 --> 37:59.973
Oh, we're talking big.

38:00.016 --> 38:01.757
[man] We've
captured the last of 'em.

38:01.801 --> 38:03.672
Is it all clear
to leave, over.

38:03.716 --> 38:05.021
[woman] Uh,

38:05.065 --> 38:07.502
we have
a problem over here.

38:07.546 --> 38:09.939
I just ran into Berret,
and he is saying,

38:09.983 --> 38:11.854
here, let me-- let me hand
my walkie over to Berret,

38:11.898 --> 38:14.074
he clearly doesn't have his,
just a second, okay?

38:14.117 --> 38:16.772
[Berret] Uh, hey there.
We have a problem, over.

38:16.816 --> 38:18.861
[man]
What's the problem, over?

38:18.905 --> 38:20.559
[Berret] I was trying to
retrieve the tracking device

38:20.602 --> 38:23.213
for number H78
and I ran into, uh--

38:25.390 --> 38:28.088
A crazy man with his
pants down began chasing me.

38:30.133 --> 38:31.961
[man] I'm sorry.
Come again, over.

38:32.005 --> 38:33.920
[Berret] A man
with his pants down.

38:33.963 --> 38:35.791
He came out of nowhere
and began chasing me.

38:35.835 --> 38:38.228
I think he knows about
H78, over.

38:38.272 --> 38:39.839
[woman]
I was scouting

38:39.882 --> 38:41.449
and I saw a house
not too far away.

38:41.493 --> 38:43.669
Maybe it belongs
to him, over?

38:43.712 --> 38:44.931
[man] Get back
to the trailer.

38:44.974 --> 38:46.324
We'll investigate, over.

38:46.367 --> 38:48.108
-[Don] Shit!
-[woman] Copy that, over.

39:11.436 --> 39:12.611
Don, what's going on?

39:12.654 --> 39:14.134
[Don] Gimme
a second, Allen!

39:15.788 --> 39:22.577
â™ª

39:23.404 --> 39:25.145
Don, should
I be doing something?

[Don grunts]

39:26.364 --> 39:28.061
[Allen panting]

39:29.018 --> 39:31.107
Damn it, Don.
What the hell is going on?

39:31.151 --> 39:32.979
[Don] This, Allen,
is what you paid

39:33.022 --> 39:34.546
your admission to see.

39:34.589 --> 39:36.243
So stop your bitchin'!

39:38.114 --> 39:39.420
Uh...

39:39.464 --> 39:40.900
Everything's all set.
Look here.

39:40.943 --> 39:43.163
I've got every trap
from here to Timbuktu on

39:43.206 --> 39:44.382
and ready to fire.

39:44.425 --> 39:45.600
They're all
sensor activated,

39:45.644 --> 39:46.688
but I can also
activate 'em by--

39:46.732 --> 39:48.037
Wait.
Hold on, hold on.

39:49.299 --> 39:51.214
You don't have a cell phone,
but you have this?

39:51.258 --> 39:52.999
I never said
I wasn't tech savvy.

39:53.042 --> 39:55.305
Everything I have
has a purpose!

39:58.483 --> 39:59.701
[Don vocalizing] Oh, yeah.

39:59.745 --> 40:01.355
Like Jean would say,

40:01.399 --> 40:04.445
"It is not
dress rehearsal anymore, Don.

40:04.489 --> 40:06.882
It's show time, damn it!"

40:07.535 --> 40:09.145
Minus the damn it part,
of course.

40:10.756 --> 40:11.800
Don.

40:13.236 --> 40:14.934
-I don't want to die.
-[Don shushing Allen]

40:14.977 --> 40:16.457
Come on,
you bastards.

40:16.501 --> 40:17.806
Make the first move!

40:18.677 --> 40:20.069
Come on!

40:20.113 --> 40:21.201
[scoffing]

40:21.244 --> 40:22.289
Allen, here.

40:23.029 --> 40:24.683
In case
we run into trouble,

40:24.726 --> 40:27.033
you have this,
and that envelope I gave you

40:27.076 --> 40:28.513
about things going south?

40:29.209 --> 40:31.298
-Might want to keep that close.
-Don?

40:31.994 --> 40:33.735
I don't want
to do any of this.

40:33.779 --> 40:35.084
[man] We know you're
in there, whoever you are.

40:35.128 --> 40:36.738
Come out now
and we can talk.

40:36.782 --> 40:38.610
[Don chuckling]

40:38.653 --> 40:40.133
[man] This is something
you think you understand,

40:40.176 --> 40:41.961
but I can guarantee you
that you don't.

40:42.004 --> 40:43.658
Just come out
so we can talk.

40:43.702 --> 40:46.269
[Don wheeze laughing]

40:47.183 --> 40:48.358
Let's just
talk to them.

40:49.359 --> 40:50.535
This doesn't have
to be a battle.

40:54.147 --> 40:55.453
You're right, Allen.

40:55.496 --> 40:56.584
It doesn't.

40:57.890 --> 40:59.457
All those sensors,

40:59.500 --> 41:02.111
they're also
voice activated.

41:03.548 --> 41:05.245
-Don.
-[Don chuckling]

41:05.288 --> 41:06.594
Stop this.

41:10.511 --> 41:12.078
[Don chuckling]

41:15.473 --> 41:16.952
[Don groaning]

41:27.572 --> 41:29.051
So here I am.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.665
Listen.

41:33.708 --> 41:35.405
You got
something I want.

41:35.449 --> 41:37.103
It's that simple,

41:37.146 --> 41:39.627
and you are not leaving here
till you hand it over.

41:39.671 --> 41:41.194
Don!
This is stupid.

41:41.237 --> 41:42.717
We have no clue
who these people are.

41:42.761 --> 41:44.371
[man]
How much do you know?

41:50.377 --> 41:51.509
[walkie bleeping]

41:51.552 --> 41:52.988
I know this much,

41:53.032 --> 41:56.035
you're trespassing
on my property

41:56.078 --> 41:58.385
and you are
in possession of something

41:58.428 --> 42:00.909
that I have been trying
to trap for some time.

42:00.953 --> 42:02.476
[man]
Is that all?

42:02.520 --> 42:04.391
I also know
that you are not leaving here

42:04.434 --> 42:07.089
without handing it over,
and that's for damn sure.

42:07.133 --> 42:08.917
Don!

42:08.961 --> 42:10.702
[man] Is that a threat
I'm hearing in your tone?

42:11.354 --> 42:12.834
[Don laughing]

42:13.400 --> 42:16.098
I don't know if you noticed,
but I'm not carrying a gun.

42:16.751 --> 42:19.058
Now, shouldn't you
be more worried?

42:19.101 --> 42:20.668
I don't know,

42:20.712 --> 42:23.105
maybe the thing
that I'm threatening you with

42:23.149 --> 42:25.499
was meant to stop something
much bigger than you?

42:27.632 --> 42:31.026
[suspenseful music]

42:31.070 --> 42:32.462
Showtime front!

42:33.507 --> 42:34.595
Showtime front!

42:35.117 --> 42:36.205
Show-- God!

42:36.249 --> 42:38.033
Shit!
Shit!

42:38.077 --> 42:39.731
Showtime front!

42:39.774 --> 42:41.384
[suspenseful music]

42:41.428 --> 42:42.734
Hey!

42:52.700 --> 42:53.832
[Don yells]

43:04.364 --> 43:05.495
I think...

43:07.585 --> 43:10.849
I think it just might be
best if I go home now.

43:26.908 --> 43:31.478
[loud thumping]

45:13.449 --> 45:15.408
[Allen]
I've met some unique

45:15.451 --> 45:18.716
and odd people
doing this show.

45:20.892 --> 45:22.458
But Don takes the cake.

45:24.722 --> 45:26.201
He really is
the craziest person

45:26.245 --> 45:27.463
I've ever met.

45:39.954 --> 45:41.782
There's no way any of you
are going to believe me

45:41.826 --> 45:43.392
when I tell you
what I saw today. [chuckling]

45:45.786 --> 45:47.483
It's like something
out of a science fiction movie.

45:50.182 --> 45:51.792
There were
these masked people,

45:53.185 --> 45:55.230
almost like they work
in Area 51 or something,

45:58.277 --> 45:59.408
and they were...

46:01.671 --> 46:02.977
well, I don't know
what they were doing.

46:05.414 --> 46:08.243
The truth is, I don't know
what I'm doing here.

46:14.032 --> 46:15.642
I can't
tell what's a bigger mystery.

46:19.167 --> 46:20.778
If the monster
is actually real...

46:26.131 --> 46:27.306
or if Don...

46:28.786 --> 46:29.830
is...

46:39.448 --> 46:40.798
I just can't read Don.

46:45.541 --> 46:48.022
I keep trying to find
meaning within Don's story,

46:48.588 --> 46:49.807
but I just-- I can't.

46:52.418 --> 46:53.680
Maybe there's no meaning.

47:00.948 --> 47:02.080
Maybe this whole thing...

47:04.560 --> 47:05.648
is crazy...

47:06.736 --> 47:07.825
random.

47:10.958 --> 47:12.046
and nothing else.

47:19.749 --> 47:20.838
As far as...

47:22.796 --> 47:24.232
do I think the monster is real?

47:29.063 --> 47:30.586
The answer is no.

47:35.853 --> 47:36.984
I think in stories...

47:38.943 --> 47:40.509
there's always more
than meets the eye.

47:47.038 --> 47:48.126
In this case...

47:52.173 --> 47:53.305
there's nothing more
to see here.

48:19.548 --> 48:20.636
[Allen] You good, Don?

48:25.467 --> 48:27.600
I'm good. [clearing throat]

48:27.643 --> 48:29.036
Wonderful.

48:30.603 --> 48:31.909
Never been better.

48:46.575 --> 48:47.837
Don?

48:47.881 --> 48:49.317
[Don] Let it be, Al.

48:50.057 --> 48:51.232
Just let it be.

48:51.841 --> 48:53.408
Everything was for nothing.

48:53.452 --> 48:54.757
Did great.

48:54.801 --> 48:55.889
Do you want to talk?

49:00.850 --> 49:02.635
Don, do you want to talk?

49:02.678 --> 49:06.900
[Don] What I would like
is for you to shut the fuck up.

49:25.963 --> 49:28.791
I... struggle...

49:29.531 --> 49:31.446
with staying in the moment.

49:34.754 --> 49:36.190
Jean would remind me.

49:36.669 --> 49:38.497
She'd say, "Come back."

49:39.411 --> 49:40.934
When she saw me daydreaming.

49:43.284 --> 49:45.895
She'd keep me grounded
when I'd wander.

49:49.290 --> 49:51.945
When she died,
everything that--

49:52.990 --> 49:56.906
that-- that kept me
grounded was gone.

49:56.950 --> 49:58.908
It didn't matter
what things I had anymore.

49:58.952 --> 49:59.997
I couldn't--

50:00.910 --> 50:03.391
Oh, God.
There I go again, I--

50:03.435 --> 50:05.350
I lost track
of where I was going.

50:07.004 --> 50:08.179
I can tell you this, though.

50:09.223 --> 50:11.051
The things
that hurt the worst

50:11.095 --> 50:12.792
are the ones
that you don't see coming.

50:15.795 --> 50:17.710
-[Allen] I would like to add--
-No, I know-- I know--

50:17.753 --> 50:20.060
I know
what I was going to say.

50:20.104 --> 50:21.279
The boxes.

50:22.193 --> 50:24.238
When Jean got sick,

50:24.282 --> 50:26.588
she decided
to leave me these things

50:26.632 --> 50:29.374
for me to find,
long after she left.

50:32.246 --> 50:33.900
And I put 'em in these boxes.

50:37.860 --> 50:38.948
And they'd...

50:39.906 --> 50:42.169
bring me back to reality
when I'd wander,

50:42.213 --> 50:43.344
which I often do.

50:47.479 --> 50:48.697
Jean told me, she'd--

50:50.743 --> 50:53.311
she left me 52 things.

50:54.747 --> 50:56.749
One for each year
we were together.

50:58.881 --> 51:01.841
I still haven't found
number 52. [laughs]

51:03.886 --> 51:05.975
I see these boxes
scattered around,

51:07.934 --> 51:09.283
and it's--
it's kind of like

51:09.327 --> 51:10.763
Jean is watching me.

51:13.635 --> 51:15.028
Does that
make me weird?

51:19.424 --> 51:21.121
You're weird,
but that's not the reason.

51:21.165 --> 51:22.818
[Don laughing softly
&amp; sniffing]

51:24.690 --> 51:26.344
In fact,
that's probably

51:26.387 --> 51:27.867
the most normal thing
you've said since I met you.

51:28.911 --> 51:30.130
Well, [sniffing]

51:31.305 --> 51:32.915
Where do you think
number 52 is?

51:35.657 --> 51:39.966
Honestly, Allen,
I don't think there is a 52.

51:42.186 --> 51:43.752
Jean's sense of humor.

51:46.233 --> 51:47.452
[exhaling hard]

51:51.195 --> 51:52.239
Are you good now, Don?

51:54.502 --> 51:55.677
Yeah, I'm good.

51:59.333 --> 52:01.466
Tomorrow I'll take you
back to your car.

52:03.250 --> 52:04.338
Sounds good.

52:06.645 --> 52:07.733
[metal box clanking]

52:18.700 --> 52:20.093
I never did tell
you why I wanted

52:20.137 --> 52:22.313
to kill Eye so bad, did I?

52:23.749 --> 52:26.360
You said it was
because she ate your cattle.

52:26.404 --> 52:27.796
[laughing] No.

52:28.667 --> 52:30.190
I was going to get
rid of the cattle

52:30.234 --> 52:31.626
and move away
from here anyway.

52:34.238 --> 52:36.501
Then why did you want to become
a monster hunter so bad?

52:37.545 --> 52:38.633
Monster hunter...

52:40.374 --> 52:42.855
never thought of myself
that way, but I'll take it.

52:44.335 --> 52:47.773
No, the reason that I wanted
to kill Eye so bad--

52:50.906 --> 52:51.994
Shit.

52:53.300 --> 52:54.475
Has that been on
the whole time?

52:57.086 --> 52:59.524
[ominous music starts]

53:14.234 --> 53:15.366
[screaming]

53:15.888 --> 53:18.543
[Al panting]

53:20.284 --> 53:21.459
Don.

53:23.896 --> 53:25.767
Don, are you okay? [sniffing]

53:27.769 --> 53:29.118
[rumbling sound]

53:43.263 --> 53:46.223
[breathing heavily &amp; grunting]

53:50.749 --> 53:55.754
[struggling &amp; crying out]

53:56.537 --> 54:01.716
[screaming &amp; panting]

54:02.587 --> 54:04.241
[grunting &amp; groaning]

54:05.154 --> 54:08.941
[panting]

54:17.341 --> 54:19.647
Okay, okay. [panting]

54:27.786 --> 54:30.005
[operator]
911. What's your emergency?

54:30.049 --> 54:31.964
Yes, yes. Yes, I--

54:32.007 --> 54:33.966
[crying out]

54:34.009 --> 54:35.141
[911 operator]
Excuse me, sir?

54:35.924 --> 54:40.929
[groaning in pain]

54:42.975 --> 54:44.281
[911 operator]
Did I just hear gunfire?

54:44.324 --> 54:46.892
[Allen crying out]

54:46.935 --> 54:48.546
[911 operator]
Sir, are you okay?

54:48.589 --> 54:51.288
[Allen crying out]

54:53.464 --> 54:55.988
[groaning in pain]

54:56.031 --> 54:57.381
[911 operator]
What is your current location?

55:00.297 --> 55:01.515
[Allen exhaling]

55:11.177 --> 55:13.048
[Allen screaming]

55:15.399 --> 55:18.532
-[911 operator] Hello?
-[Allen breathing heavily]

55:23.929 --> 55:27.498
[grunting &amp; manual breathing]

55:27.541 --> 55:29.064
[911 operator] Sir,
what is your current location?

55:30.979 --> 55:35.244
[grunting &amp; screaming]

55:35.288 --> 55:37.725
[whimpering]

55:40.902 --> 55:42.730
[yelling]

55:42.774 --> 55:43.992
[911 operator]
Sir, are you okay?

55:44.602 --> 55:47.344
[breathing heavily &amp; screaming]

55:47.996 --> 55:49.476
[yelling]

55:49.520 --> 55:51.957
Don! Don!

55:56.004 --> 56:00.008
[struggling in pain]

56:04.186 --> 56:06.101
[911 operator]
Sir, can you hear me?

56:07.755 --> 56:11.324
[grunting in pain]

56:13.195 --> 56:14.588
[911 operator]
Do you need help?

56:14.632 --> 56:15.633
What is your
current location?

56:15.676 --> 56:16.764
Shit!

56:17.374 --> 56:21.552
[gasping &amp; screaming]

56:25.947 --> 56:28.385
[grunting &amp; groaning]

56:32.476 --> 56:36.654
[panting]

[screaming]

57:06.858 --> 57:09.817
[groaning]

57:22.003 --> 57:25.137
[Allen] Okay, uh--
[chuckling softly]

57:25.180 --> 57:26.617
What do I say?

57:26.660 --> 57:28.009
I'm currently trapped

57:28.749 --> 57:32.361
in a house
that is a... booby--

57:36.540 --> 57:38.498
-[atmospheric music starts]
-Yeah.

57:42.894 --> 57:47.072
I think Don broke something
when he got mad.

57:48.465 --> 57:50.815
Now the house
has gone rogue.

57:50.858 --> 57:52.773
[Don]
If the shit hits the fan,

57:52.817 --> 57:54.645
I wrote up a set of
guidelines for you to follow.

57:55.123 --> 57:56.211
Wait, the envelope.

57:56.821 --> 57:58.387
Don-- Don left me a note,

57:58.431 --> 57:59.998
for when things go south.

58:00.041 --> 58:02.783
So you don't get
blown up and shit.

58:02.827 --> 58:08.267
The note says, number one,
"Avoid every fridge."

58:08.310 --> 58:10.138
The word
"every" is underlined.

58:10.182 --> 58:12.924
Number two,
"Avoid all gray tiles."

58:12.967 --> 58:15.753
Number three, I quote,
"Truck will shoot at you

58:15.796 --> 58:18.103
if you get too close
and the red light is on."

58:18.799 --> 58:20.409
Number four,
"Some doors are fake."

58:21.367 --> 58:24.326
Number five, "Do not let
Bladey get too close to you."

58:24.370 --> 58:25.893
-"Not" underlined.
-[Don with Allen] " Six,

58:25.937 --> 58:28.330
find the encore button
in the garage.

58:28.374 --> 58:32.030
Bait and other shit
rigged to explode. Don."

58:32.073 --> 58:34.641
[paper crinkling
&amp; Allen panting]

58:41.561 --> 58:42.997
Okay. Okay.

58:43.737 --> 58:45.478
Okay, I'm going to cut
the bullshit.

58:49.177 --> 58:50.657
I have no way
of getting out of here

58:50.701 --> 58:52.267
because I have
no idea where I am.

58:55.880 --> 58:57.142
So, where does that
leave me?

59:01.146 --> 59:02.887
I might not make
it out of here.

59:08.414 --> 59:10.547
So let me leave you
with some final thoughts.

59:12.549 --> 59:13.593
Right now...

59:15.552 --> 59:16.596
I'm terrified.

59:20.426 --> 59:22.123
My actions
have led me here.

59:26.258 --> 59:27.346
And for what?

59:29.043 --> 59:30.131
[radio cackling]

59:30.784 --> 59:32.394
[man]
Hello?

59:32.438 --> 59:33.787
Is anyone there?

59:35.354 --> 59:36.573
Hello?

59:37.661 --> 59:41.055
[screaming]

59:43.754 --> 59:45.669
[choking]

59:45.712 --> 59:48.149
[coughing]

59:52.850 --> 59:55.417
[man] If someone's there,
please pick up.

59:55.461 --> 59:58.812
[panting &amp; yelling]

1:00:09.301 --> 1:00:10.389
[man] Anyone?

1:00:16.961 --> 1:00:19.224
[struggling]

1:00:22.009 --> 1:00:24.185
[man] I need to know
if anyone can hear me.

1:00:24.229 --> 1:00:25.839
-Hello? Yes, I'm here.
-[man] Hello?

1:00:25.883 --> 1:00:27.841
Good. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1:00:27.885 --> 1:00:29.016
I need your help,
I'm hurt--

1:00:29.060 --> 1:00:30.148
I'm hurt really bad.

1:00:31.671 --> 1:00:32.716
I actually
need your help, too.

1:00:32.759 --> 1:00:34.326
I'm stuck in a house that--

1:00:34.369 --> 1:00:36.197
[man] No, listen.
You don't understand.

1:00:36.241 --> 1:00:38.809
I-- I-- I'm currently
stuck in this truck.

1:00:39.984 --> 1:00:41.246
And it's just
me right now.

1:00:42.160 --> 1:00:43.683
Everyone I'm with got eaten.

1:00:43.727 --> 1:00:44.771
Eaten?

1:00:46.686 --> 1:00:49.297
[man] It somehow got loose
and we couldn't contain it.

1:00:49.341 --> 1:00:51.691
The latch on the trailer
must have been insecure.

1:00:51.735 --> 1:00:54.868
Are you one of them,
those people from earlier?

1:00:57.001 --> 1:00:59.046
[man][whimpering]
I don't want to die.

1:01:00.047 --> 1:01:01.527
What is it?

1:01:01.570 --> 1:01:03.137
[man] It can't be stopped.

1:01:03.181 --> 1:01:04.965
No. No, no!

1:01:05.879 --> 1:01:07.272
-Hello?
-[soft roaring over radio]

1:01:07.315 --> 1:01:09.013
[man] No. No!

Okay.

1:01:47.225 --> 1:01:48.661
I made it
out of the house.

1:01:51.533 --> 1:01:54.623
But, I don't think...
[grunting]

1:01:55.886 --> 1:01:57.931
I'm out
of harm's way yet.

1:02:04.024 --> 1:02:05.243
If I can just...

1:02:06.635 --> 1:02:10.117

1:02:12.206 --> 1:02:13.773
without that light
turning on...

1:02:18.604 --> 1:02:19.692
I should be okay.

1:02:21.912 --> 1:02:24.088
Otherwise,
I'll be dead.

about an encore button...

Oh, shit. Shit!

"How lame is this?"

1:08:10.042 --> 1:08:13.393
This was supposed to be
a story about--

about a man
hunting a monster.

1:08:19.747 --> 1:08:21.053
Instead,

1:08:21.097 --> 1:08:22.794
I'm going to die

begin...

1:13:29.492 --> 1:13:31.015

I'm confused.

1:17:58.848 --> 1:18:00.632
We're having a hard time
following your story.

1:18:01.981 --> 1:18:03.940
You said that you were
interviewing Mr. Thomas

1:18:03.983 --> 1:18:05.071
for a podcast.

1:18:05.115 --> 1:18:06.377
What about?

1:18:12.862 --> 1:18:14.167
I don't know anymore.

1:19:12.399 --> 1:19:13.923
[Kim] I have no idea
where Allen went.

1:19:13.966 --> 1:19:15.576
It's like he fell off
the face of the earth.

1:19:18.449 --> 1:19:19.537
Yeah, I know.

1:19:22.670 --> 1:19:23.759
Hey, hold on one second.

1:19:30.722 --> 1:19:32.811
Oh, my God.

1:19:34.204 --> 1:19:37.076
[Don] Still
haven't found number 52.

1:19:39.165 --> 1:19:41.428
I see these boxes
scattered around.

1:19:42.952 --> 1:19:44.910
It's kind of like
Jean is watching me.

1:19:47.130 --> 1:19:48.914
The second thing
you need to know

1:19:48.958 --> 1:19:53.049
is that this entire place
is booby trapped.

1:19:53.092 --> 1:19:54.528
[Kim] They loved
your story, Allen.

1:19:56.792 --> 1:19:58.445
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

1:19:59.011 --> 1:20:00.665
I loved your story.

1:20:00.708 --> 1:20:05.322
It's got so much heart
and suspense.

1:20:06.236 --> 1:20:08.151
It's a survival story,
people love that.

1:20:09.892 --> 1:20:11.328
It's got a bit of everything,
doesn't it?

1:20:11.371 --> 1:20:12.459
Yeah.

1:20:13.417 --> 1:20:14.505
It was a bitch to get.

1:20:15.419 --> 1:20:16.463
Yeah, I bet.

1:20:17.595 --> 1:20:21.120
So listen,
APR wants you back.

1:20:21.642 --> 1:20:22.730
Oh, I don't know.

1:20:24.732 --> 1:20:26.082
I mean,
what about the lawsuit?

1:20:26.125 --> 1:20:27.823
I have a meeting

1:20:27.866 --> 1:20:30.042
with the board of directors
at APR in the morning,

1:20:30.086 --> 1:20:34.177
but word is that the case
is not going anywhere.

1:20:35.656 --> 1:20:36.744
[Allen sighing]

1:20:37.876 --> 1:20:39.225
They really
want you back, Allen.

1:20:42.272 --> 1:20:44.491
They did have one note
for the story.

1:20:46.232 --> 1:20:47.364
What?

1:20:48.060 --> 1:20:49.192
We never see the monster.

1:20:50.454 --> 1:20:52.325
And? It's a podcast.

1:20:52.369 --> 1:20:55.415
I know that, but...
maybe we do, like,

1:20:55.459 --> 1:20:58.070
a video and get somebody
to animate your story.

1:20:58.114 --> 1:21:00.768
I just-- I feel like people
are going to be disappointed

1:21:00.812 --> 1:21:03.075
if they don't get
an image of the monster.

1:21:03.119 --> 1:21:06.774
I mean,
you did see it, right?

1:21:07.471 --> 1:21:09.821
I mean, the focus
of the story is Don, isn't it?

1:21:10.822 --> 1:21:12.041
Does the monster
even matter?

1:21:12.084 --> 1:21:14.565
[laughs] Yes, Allen, it does.

1:21:14.608 --> 1:21:16.219
Of course it matters,
it's a monster story.

1:21:16.262 --> 1:21:18.134
You can't have a monster story
without a monster.

1:21:22.051 --> 1:21:23.139
Let me think about it.

1:21:24.531 --> 1:21:26.794
-I'll get back to you.
-Awesome.

1:21:28.187 --> 1:21:29.275
Welcome back, Allen.

1:21:31.451 --> 1:21:33.323
Can't wait to see what
your next story's gonna be.

1:21:34.541 --> 1:21:37.501
Hey. Also, I'm curious,

1:21:37.544 --> 1:21:39.111
this monster
with all the eyes...

1:21:40.417 --> 1:21:43.550
do you think there's more
in the woods near Don's house?

1:21:48.991 --> 1:21:52.429
For Don's sake,
I really hope so.

1:21:53.734 --> 1:21:55.040
[chuckles softly]

1:22:06.008 --> 1:22:10.751
[upbeat electronica starts]

1:22:26.245 --> 1:22:27.986
[announcer] This is U.S. Sane.

1:22:31.685 --> 1:22:32.904
Whenever you're ready.

1:22:51.749 --> 1:22:53.011
I'm not ready.

1:22:57.929 --> 1:22:59.626
I have an amazing
story, but I'm not...

1:23:00.845 --> 1:23:01.933
ready to tell it.

1:23:04.066 --> 1:23:07.243
[inhaling]
Life is complicated.

1:23:10.202 --> 1:23:12.117
People--
people are complicated.

1:23:15.555 --> 1:23:18.080
You don't need a podcast host
to tell you that.

1:23:21.170 --> 1:23:23.085
People are always
trying to find...

1:23:24.521 --> 1:23:27.785
a meaning
in life's complications.

1:23:28.873 --> 1:23:30.092
Even when that meaning is--

1:23:31.963 --> 1:23:33.486
even when that meaning
makes no sense.

1:23:35.749 --> 1:23:37.795
Sometimes
crazy things happen.

1:23:38.970 --> 1:23:41.755
and they add up,
and they add up,

1:23:41.799 --> 1:23:44.845
and add up,
and the meaning...

1:23:47.022 --> 1:23:48.066
is nothing.

1:23:51.243 --> 1:23:52.462
That's okay,

1:23:54.029 --> 1:23:56.857
because eventually the meaning
will rise to the surface.

1:23:58.468 --> 1:24:00.426
Maybe not in a clear,
decoded way,

1:24:03.255 --> 1:24:04.517
but it will.

1:24:05.736 --> 1:24:07.216
In the meantime...

1:24:08.391 --> 1:24:10.697
let me tell you
the important facts,

1:24:13.657 --> 1:24:15.398
and together
we'll find the story.

1:24:18.270 --> 1:24:19.358
Let me begin...

1:24:22.013 --> 1:24:23.493
with a free-spirited...

1:24:24.494 --> 1:24:28.715
and unpredictable man
named Don Thomas...

1:24:30.021 --> 1:24:31.066
