41:41.237 --> 41:42.717
We have no clue
who these people are.

41:42.761 --> 41:44.371
[man]
How much do you know?

41:50.377 --> 41:51.509
[walkie bleeping]

41:51.552 --> 41:52.988
I know this much,

41:53.032 --> 41:56.035
you're trespassing
on my property

41:56.078 --> 41:58.385
and you are
in possession of something

41:58.428 --> 42:00.909
that I have been trying
to trap for some time.

42:00.953 --> 42:02.476
[man]
Is that all?

42:02.520 --> 42:04.391
I also know
that you are not leaving here

42:04.434 --> 42:07.089
without handing it over,
and that's for damn sure.

42:07.133 --> 42:08.917
Don!

42:08.961 --> 42:10.702
[man] Is that a threat
I'm hearing in your tone?

42:11.354 --> 42:12.834
[Don laughing]

42:13.400 --> 42:16.098
I don't know if you noticed,
but I'm not carrying a gun.

42:16.751 --> 42:19.058
Now, shouldn't you
be more worried?

42:19.101 --> 42:20.668
I don't know,

42:20.712 --> 42:23.105
maybe the thing
that I'm threatening you with

42:23.149 --> 42:25.499
was meant to stop something
much bigger than you?

42:27.632 --> 42:31.026
[suspenseful music]

42:31.070 --> 42:32.462
Showtime front!

42:33.507 --> 42:34.595
Showtime front!

42:35.117 --> 42:36.205
Show-- God!

42:36.249 --> 42:38.033
Shit!
Shit!

42:38.077 --> 42:39.731
Showtime front!

42:39.774 --> 42:41.384
[suspenseful music]

42:41.428 --> 42:42.734
Hey!

42:52.700 --> 42:53.832
[Don yells]

43:04.364 --> 43:05.495
I think...

43:07.585 --> 43:10.849
I think it just might be
best if I go home now.

43:26.908 --> 43:31.478
[loud thumping]

45:13.449 --> 45:15.408
[Allen]
I've met some unique

45:15.451 --> 45:18.716
and odd people
doing this show.

45:20.892 --> 45:22.458
But Don takes the cake.

45:24.722 --> 45:26.201
He really is
the craziest person

45:26.245 --> 45:27.463
I've ever met.

45:39.954 --> 45:41.782
There's no way any of you
are going to believe me

45:41.826 --> 45:43.392
when I tell you
what I saw today. [chuckling]

45:45.786 --> 45:47.483
It's like something
out of a science fiction movie.

45:50.182 --> 45:51.792
There were
these masked people,

45:53.185 --> 45:55.230
almost like they work
in Area 51 or something,

45:58.277 --> 45:59.408
and they were...

46:01.671 --> 46:02.977
well, I don't know
what they were doing.

46:05.414 --> 46:08.243
The truth is, I don't know
what I'm doing here.

46:14.032 --> 46:15.642
I can't
tell what's a bigger mystery.

46:19.167 --> 46:20.778
If the monster
is actually real...

46:26.131 --> 46:27.306
or if Don...

46:28.786 --> 46:29.830
is...

46:39.448 --> 46:40.798
I just can't read Don.

46:45.541 --> 46:48.022
I keep trying to find
meaning within Don's story,

46:48.588 --> 46:49.807
but I just-- I can't.

46:52.418 --> 46:53.680
Maybe there's no meaning.

47:00.948 --> 47:02.080
Maybe this whole thing...

47:04.560 --> 47:05.648
is crazy...

47:06.736 --> 47:07.825
random.

47:10.958 --> 47:12.046
and nothing else.

47:19.749 --> 47:20.838
As far as...

47:22.796 --> 47:24.232
do I think the monster is real?

47:29.063 --> 47:30.586
The answer is no.

47:35.853 --> 47:36.984
I think in stories...

47:38.943 --> 47:40.509
there's always more
than meets the eye.

47:47.038 --> 47:48.126
In this case...

47:52.173 --> 47:53.305
there's nothing more
to see here.

48:19.548 --> 48:20.636
[Allen] You good, Don?

48:25.467 --> 48:27.600
I'm good. [clearing throat]

48:27.643 --> 48:29.036
Wonderful.

48:30.603 --> 48:31.909
Never been better.

48:46.575 --> 48:47.837
Don?

48:47.881 --> 48:49.317
[Don] Let it be, Al.

48:50.057 --> 48:51.232
Just let it be.

48:51.841 --> 48:53.408
Everything was for nothing.

48:53.452 --> 48:54.757
Did great.

48:54.801 --> 48:55.889
Do you want to talk?

49:00.850 --> 49:02.635
Don, do you want to talk?

49:02.678 --> 49:06.900
[Don] What I would like
is for you to shut the fuck up.

49:25.963 --> 49:28.791
I... struggle...

49:29.531 --> 49:31.446
with staying in the moment.

49:34.754 --> 49:36.190
Jean would remind me.

49:36.669 --> 49:38.497
She'd say, "Come back."

49:39.411 --> 49:40.934
When she saw me daydreaming.

49:43.284 --> 49:45.895
She'd keep me grounded
when I'd wander.

49:49.290 --> 49:51.945
When she died,
everything that--

49:52.990 --> 49:56.906
that-- that kept me
grounded was gone.

49:56.950 --> 49:58.908
It didn't matter
what things I had anymore.

49:58.952 --> 49:59.997
I couldn't--

50:00.910 --> 50:03.391
Oh, God.
There I go again, I--

50:03.435 --> 50:05.350
I lost track
of where I was going.

50:07.004 --> 50:08.179
I can tell you this, though.

50:09.223 --> 50:11.051
The things
that hurt the worst

50:11.095 --> 50:12.792
are the ones
that you don't see coming.

50:15.795 --> 50:17.710
-[Allen] I would like to add--
-No, I know-- I know--

50:17.753 --> 50:20.060
I know
what I was going to say.

50:20.104 --> 50:21.279
The boxes.

50:22.193 --> 50:24.238
When Jean got sick,

50:24.282 --> 50:26.588
she decided
to leave me these things

50:26.632 --> 50:29.374
for me to find,
long after she left.

50:32.246 --> 50:33.900
And I put 'em in these boxes.

50:37.860 --> 50:38.948
And they'd...

50:39.906 --> 50:42.169
bring me back to reality
when I'd wander,

50:42.213 --> 50:43.344
which I often do.

50:47.479 --> 50:48.697
Jean told me, she'd--

50:50.743 --> 50:53.311
she left me 52 things.

50:54.747 --> 50:56.749
One for each year
we were together.

50:58.881 --> 51:01.841
I still haven't found
number 52. [laughs]

51:03.886 --> 51:05.975
I see these boxes
scattered around,

51:07.934 --> 51:09.283
and it's--
it's kind of like

51:09.327 --> 51:10.763
Jean is watching me.

51:13.635 --> 51:15.028
Does that
make me weird?

51:19.424 --> 51:21.121
You're weird,
but that's not the reason.

51:21.165 --> 51:22.818
[Don laughing softly
&amp; sniffing]

51:24.690 --> 51:26.344
In fact,
that's probably

51:26.387 --> 51:27.867
the most normal thing
you've said since I met you.

51:28.911 --> 51:30.130
Well, [sniffing]

51:31.305 --> 51:32.915
Where do you think
number 52 is?

51:35.657 --> 51:39.966
Honestly, Allen,
I don't think there is a 52.

51:42.186 --> 51:43.752
Jean's sense of humor.

51:46.233 --> 51:47.452
[exhaling hard]

51:51.195 --> 51:52.239
Are you good now, Don?

51:54.502 --> 51:55.677
Yeah, I'm good.

51:59.333 --> 52:01.466
Tomorrow I'll take you
back to your car.

52:03.250 --> 52:04.338
Sounds good.

52:06.645 --> 52:07.733
[metal box clanking]

52:18.700 --> 52:20.093
I never did tell
you why I wanted

52:20.137 --> 52:22.313
to kill Eye so bad, did I?

52:23.749 --> 52:26.360
You said it was
because she ate your cattle.

52:26.404 --> 52:27.796
[laughing] No.

52:28.667 --> 52:30.190
I was going to get
rid of the cattle

52:30.234 --> 52:31.626
and move away
from here anyway.

52:34.238 --> 52:36.501
Then why did you want to become
a monster hunter so bad?

52:37.545 --> 52:38.633
Monster hunter...

52:40.374 --> 52:42.855
never thought of myself
that way, but I'll take it.

52:44.335 --> 52:47.773
No, the reason that I wanted
to kill Eye so bad--

52:50.906 --> 52:51.994
Shit.

52:53.300 --> 52:54.475
Has that been on
the whole time?

52:57.086 --> 52:59.524
[ominous music starts]

53:14.234 --> 53:15.366
[screaming]

53:15.888 --> 53:18.543
[Al panting]

53:20.284 --> 53:21.459
Don.

53:23.896 --> 53:25.767
Don, are you okay? [sniffing]

53:27.769 --> 53:29.118
[rumbling sound]

53:43.263 --> 53:46.223
[breathing heavily &amp; grunting]

53:50.749 --> 53:55.754
[struggling &amp; crying out]

53:56.537 --> 54:01.716
[screaming &amp; panting]

54:02.587 --> 54:04.241
[grunting &amp; groaning]

54:05.154 --> 54:08.941
[panting]

54:17.341 --> 54:19.647
Okay, okay. [panting]

54:27.786 --> 54:30.005
[operator]
911. What's your emergency?

54:30.049 --> 54:31.964
Yes, yes. Yes, I--

54:32.007 --> 54:33.966
[crying out]

54:34.009 --> 54:35.141
[911 operator]
Excuse me, sir?

54:35.924 --> 54:40.929
[groaning in pain]

54:42.975 --> 54:44.281
[911 operator]
Did I just hear gunfire?

54:44.324 --> 54:46.892
[Allen crying out]

54:46.935 --> 54:48.546
[911 operator]
Sir, are you okay?

54:48.589 --> 54:51.288
[Allen crying out]

54:53.464 --> 54:55.988
[groaning in pain]

54:56.031 --> 54:57.381
[911 operator]
What is your current location?

55:00.297 --> 55:01.515
[Allen exhaling]

55:11.177 --> 55:13.048
[Allen screaming]

55:15.399 --> 55:18.532
-[911 operator] Hello?
-[Allen breathing heavily]

55:23.929 --> 55:27.498
[grunting &amp; manual breathing]

55:27.541 --> 55:29.064
[911 operator] Sir,
what is your current location?

55:30.979 --> 55:35.244
[grunting &amp; screaming]

55:35.288 --> 55:37.725
[whimpering]

55:40.902 --> 55:42.730
[yelling]

55:42.774 --> 55:43.992
[911 operator]
Sir, are you okay?

55:44.602 --> 55:47.344
[breathing heavily &amp; screaming]

55:47.996 --> 55:49.476
[yelling]

55:49.520 --> 55:51.957
Don! Don!

55:56.004 --> 56:00.008
[struggling in pain]

56:04.186 --> 56:06.101
[911 operator]
Sir, can you hear me?

56:07.755 --> 56:11.324
[grunting in pain]

56:13.195 --> 56:14.588
[911 operator]
Do you need help?

56:14.632 --> 56:15.633
What is your
current location?

56:15.676 --> 56:16.764
Shit!

56:17.374 --> 56:21.552
[gasping &amp; screaming]

56:25.947 --> 56:28.385
[grunting &amp; groaning]

56:32.476 --> 56:36.654
[panting]

56:49.362 --> 56:50.494
[groaning]

56:59.024 --> 57:00.286

[screaming]

57:06.858 --> 57:09.817
[groaning]

57:22.003 --> 57:25.137
[Allen] Okay, uh--
[chuckling softly]

57:25.180 --> 57:26.617
What do I say?

57:26.660 --> 57:28.009
I'm currently trapped

57:28.749 --> 57:32.361
in a house
that is a... booby--

57:36.540 --> 57:38.498
-[atmospheric music starts]
-Yeah.

57:42.894 --> 57:47.072
I think Don broke something
when he got mad.

57:48.465 --> 57:50.815
Now the house
has gone rogue.

57:50.858 --> 57:52.773
[Don]
If the shit hits the fan,

57:52.817 --> 57:54.645
I wrote up a set of
guidelines for you to follow.

57:55.123 --> 57:56.211
Wait, the envelope.

57:56.821 --> 57:58.387
Don-- Don left me a note,

57:58.431 --> 57:59.998
for when things go south.

58:00.041 --> 58:02.783
So you don't get
blown up and shit.

58:02.827 --> 58:08.267
The note says, number one,
"Avoid every fridge."

58:08.310 --> 58:10.138
The word
"every" is underlined.

58:10.182 --> 58:12.924
Number two,
"Avoid all gray tiles."

58:12.967 --> 58:15.753
Number three, I quote,
"Truck will shoot at you

58:15.796 --> 58:18.103
if you get too close
and the red light is on."

58:18.799 --> 58:20.409
Number four,
"Some doors are fake."

58:21.367 --> 58:24.326
Number five, "Do not let
Bladey get too close to you."

58:24.370 --> 58:25.893
-"Not" underlined.
-[Don with Allen] " Six,

58:25.937 --> 58:28.330
find the encore button
in the garage.

58:28.374 --> 58:32.030
Bait and other shit
rigged to explode. Don."

58:32.073 --> 58:34.641
[paper crinkling
&amp; Allen panting]

58:41.561 --> 58:42.997
Okay. Okay.

58:43.737 --> 58:45.478
Okay, I'm going to cut
the bullshit.

58:49.177 --> 58:50.657
I have no way
of getting out of here

58:50.701 --> 58:52.267
because I have
no idea where I am.

58:55.880 --> 58:57.142
So, where does that
leave me?

59:01.146 --> 59:02.887
I might not make
it out of here.

59:08.414 --> 59:10.547
So let me leave you
with some final thoughts.

59:12.549 --> 59:13.593
Right now...

59:15.552 --> 59:16.596
I'm terrified.

59:20.426 --> 59:22.123
My actions
have led me here.

59:26.258 --> 59:27.346
And for what?

59:29.043 --> 59:30.131
[radio cackling]

59:30.784 --> 59:32.394
[man]
Hello?

59:32.438 --> 59:33.787
Is anyone there?

59:35.354 --> 59:36.573
Hello?

59:37.661 --> 59:41.055
[screaming]

59:43.754 --> 59:45.669
[choking]

59:45.712 --> 59:48.149
[coughing]

59:52.850 --> 59:55.417
[man] If someone's there,
please pick up.

59:55.461 --> 59:58.812
[panting &amp; yelling]

1:00:09.301 --> 1:00:10.389
[man] Anyone?

1:00:16.961 --> 1:00:19.224
[struggling]

1:00:22.009 --> 1:00:24.185
[man] I need to know
if anyone can hear me.

1:00:24.229 --> 1:00:25.839
-Hello? Yes, I'm here.
-[man] Hello?

1:00:25.883 --> 1:00:27.841
Good. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1:00:27.885 --> 1:00:29.016
I need your help,
I'm hurt--

1:00:29.060 --> 1:00:30.148
I'm hurt really bad.

1:00:31.671 --> 1:00:32.716
I actually
need your help, too.

1:00:32.759 --> 1:00:34.326
I'm stuck in a house that--

1:00:34.369 --> 1:00:36.197
[man] No, listen.
You don't understand.

1:00:36.241 --> 1:00:38.809
I-- I-- I'm currently
stuck in this truck.

1:00:39.984 --> 1:00:41.246
And it's just
me right now.

1:00:42.160 --> 1:00:43.683
Everyone I'm with got eaten.

1:00:43.727 --> 1:00:44.771
Eaten?

1:00:46.686 --> 1:00:49.297
