WEBVTT

00:04.009 --> 00:05.043
Oh, shh.

00:06.930 --> 00:09.264
Come on.

00:15.983 --> 00:19.335
Nadine, Nadine, I'm here, I'm...

00:20.371 --> 00:22.555
They want to do what?

00:23.825 --> 00:26.409
Tell-tell, um, tell POTUS I'm...

00:26.410 --> 00:27.793
I'm on my way.

00:27.794 --> 00:29.079
I'll be right there, okay?

00:29.080 --> 00:32.249
And, um, get, uh, Captain Baker.

00:32.250 --> 00:35.252
Call Captain Baker. I
want her in the Sit Room.

00:35.253 --> 00:36.586
Is it about the smuggling ring?

00:36.587 --> 00:40.974
CIA found another cargo
flight carrying contraband.

00:40.975 --> 00:42.976
That's a good thing, isn't it?

00:42.977 --> 00:45.611
Not if they force it down.

00:48.266 --> 00:50.684
Punjab Cargo, Flight 417,

00:50.685 --> 00:52.185
en route to India.

00:52.186 --> 00:55.071
Refueled in Spain and made
an unscheduled stop in Cairo.

00:55.072 --> 00:56.439
Just like the flights to Somalia.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.223
It seems your smuggling
ring is still active.

00:58.224 --> 01:00.443
Okay, first of all, it's
not my smuggling ring.

01:00.444 --> 01:02.946
And second, why do we have
armed fighters in the sky?

01:02.947 --> 01:05.197
It was supposed to be
a passive operation.

01:05.199 --> 01:07.200
- Not anymore.
- Mr. President, why are...

01:07.201 --> 01:09.452
Bess, the situation has evolved. Hugh.

01:09.453 --> 01:11.171
Our man on the ground in Cairo

01:11.172 --> 01:13.456
was able to infiltrate the
aircraft during refueling.

01:13.457 --> 01:15.425
And he sent us this.

01:15.426 --> 01:16.960
More than a dozen shoulder-launched,

01:16.961 --> 01:18.261
surface-to-air missiles.

01:18.262 --> 01:20.797
Each with enough firepower
to bring down a jetliner.

01:20.798 --> 01:24.301
I've ordered a squadron of F-35s
out of Incirlik to intercept.

01:24.302 --> 01:25.886
Contact in just under two
minutes, Mr. President.

01:25.887 --> 01:27.020
- It's a mistake.
- I know your plan

01:27.021 --> 01:28.271
was to observe and report

01:28.272 --> 01:29.806
until we could find the
mole at the State Department,

01:29.807 --> 01:32.275
but I can't risk those missiles
falling into the wrong hands.

01:32.276 --> 01:33.527
We're gonna force

01:33.528 --> 01:35.145
the plane to land at Al Udeid

01:35.146 --> 01:36.646
and sequester the cargo.

01:36.647 --> 01:37.864
What if they refuse?

01:37.865 --> 01:39.008
Current flight plan has them

01:39.009 --> 01:40.784
over the empty quarter of Saudi Arabia.

01:40.785 --> 01:42.202
Collateral damage would be minimal.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.987
Not for the investigation.

01:43.988 --> 01:46.289
The mole will know that
we're onto the smuggling ring.

01:46.290 --> 01:47.991
He'll go to ground,
we'll never catch him.

01:47.992 --> 01:49.258
Contact in one minute.

01:50.044 --> 01:51.795
Captain Baker,

01:51.796 --> 01:53.330
tell the president your plan.

01:53.331 --> 01:57.083
I built an authentication
bot that self-generates

01:57.084 --> 01:58.501
- a capture log.
- The fast version.

01:58.502 --> 02:00.420
Um, yes, we placed a trap door

02:00.421 --> 02:01.304
in the State Department's

02:01.305 --> 02:02.466
computer system, so if anyone

02:02.467 --> 02:04.017
tampers with the manifest, we'll know.

02:04.018 --> 02:07.143
Did your agent place a tracking
device on those missiles?

02:07.144 --> 02:08.544
Of course, but that-that doesn't...

02:08.545 --> 02:10.329
Well then, we'll hardly
lose 'em if it lands.

02:10.330 --> 02:13.447
We have assets in Delhi who
can recover the Stingers.

02:14.185 --> 02:16.486
But the mole is the
only one who can tell us

02:16.487 --> 02:18.454
who murdered Agent Garcia.

02:19.657 --> 02:20.941
Sir,

02:20.942 --> 02:23.443
I strongly advise you to
call off this intercept.

02:23.444 --> 02:25.028
What, and trust a program

02:25.029 --> 02:26.246
created by a 12-year-old?

02:26.247 --> 02:27.930
Need a decision, Mr. President.

02:33.004 --> 02:34.504
Tell our pilots to bug out.

02:34.505 --> 02:38.041
Bravo 6, Bravo 7, disengage.
I repeat, disengage.

02:38.042 --> 02:39.259
RTB, ASAP.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.427
I want hourly reports on those Stingers

02:40.428 --> 02:41.428
until we get a result.

02:41.429 --> 02:42.429
Yes, Mr. President.

02:42.430 --> 02:43.513
And if those missiles

02:43.514 --> 02:45.447
are in danger, I'm shutting it down.

02:48.352 --> 02:49.552
Morning, gang.

02:49.553 --> 02:51.388
- Hi.
- Good morning.

02:51.389 --> 02:52.439
Crisis averted?

02:52.440 --> 02:54.774
Or started, maybe.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.893
What, no more eggs?

02:56.894 --> 02:58.708
Sorry, Growing Boy strikes again.

02:58.709 --> 03:01.064
- Jace?
- They're your chromosomes, lady.

03:01.065 --> 03:03.033
Well, I blame the McCords.

03:03.034 --> 03:06.152
Speaking of, Maureen sent you something.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.822
Oh, she's been cleaning out Dad's place.

03:08.823 --> 03:11.408
Apparently, he left
this for me in the attic.

03:11.409 --> 03:14.127
Unbelievable.

03:14.128 --> 03:16.913
Interesting choice for an heirloom.

03:16.914 --> 03:18.248
It's a Renwal

03:18.249 --> 03:19.799
Visible V8 engine.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.085
It was my Christmas present
in, like, seventh grade.

03:22.086 --> 03:23.920
Never could get this thing to work.

03:23.921 --> 03:25.424
Really? Didn't Grandpa hate quitters?

03:25.425 --> 03:28.341
Oh, yeah. You got to admire his style.

03:28.342 --> 03:31.261
He threw out all my trophies
and comics, leaves me this.

03:31.262 --> 03:32.479
You ready, dorkus?

03:32.480 --> 03:33.680
Hey Jace,

03:33.681 --> 03:35.015
you want to help me see if we can

03:35.016 --> 03:36.316
finally get this thing to work?

03:36.317 --> 03:38.485
Uh, and foster a legacy of
intergenerational cruelty?

03:38.486 --> 03:39.653
I think I'll pass.

03:39.654 --> 03:41.237
Don't bother asking me, Dad,

03:41.238 --> 03:42.989
because why would a girl be interested?

03:42.990 --> 03:44.574
Alison, I didn't think...

03:44.575 --> 03:45.992
That's the point.

03:45.993 --> 03:47.827
And I'm not, but maybe
I would have been.

03:47.828 --> 03:48.945
Bye.

03:48.946 --> 03:50.163
Bye.

03:50.164 --> 03:51.867
Oh, so you're gonna go?

03:51.868 --> 03:53.917
Well played, Super Dad.

03:54.952 --> 03:55.952
You really thought

03:55.953 --> 03:56.920
Jace was gonna want...

03:56.921 --> 03:58.538
Well, it's just been such a long time

03:58.539 --> 03:59.789
since we've done anything...

03:59.790 --> 04:01.453
...that didn't involve
a teachable moment.

04:01.454 --> 04:02.425
Oh, I got to go in.

04:02.426 --> 04:03.426
Well, if you're looking

04:03.427 --> 04:04.594
for a shared activity,

04:04.595 --> 04:06.895
I have DVR'ed tons of Cupcake Wars.

04:07.682 --> 04:09.182
Oh, boy.

04:09.183 --> 04:12.018
There is no food in this house.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.637
Hey, Henry.

04:14.638 --> 04:15.722
Is Ian okay?

04:15.723 --> 04:18.108
No idea. That's kind of the problem.

04:18.108 --> 04:19.809
The camera broke again?

04:19.810 --> 04:22.112
Went off the air two hours ago.

04:22.113 --> 04:23.396
Techs just gave up

04:23.397 --> 04:25.565
- on getting it back.
- Damn it.

04:25.566 --> 04:26.900
Well, was there anything new?

04:26.901 --> 04:29.652
Learned a lot about
digging latrines. And...

04:29.653 --> 04:32.989
this just came in from
Special Surveillance Group.

04:32.990 --> 04:38.294
Team of VFF guys installing
new defensive weaponry

04:38.295 --> 04:41.548
on their perimeter. Anti-tank ditches,

04:41.549 --> 04:43.348
M18 Claymores...

04:44.085 --> 04:45.969
...couple of M40s.

04:45.970 --> 04:47.804
They're anticipating a raid.

04:47.805 --> 04:49.139
Which means whatever kind

04:49.140 --> 04:51.174
of attack they're planning,

04:51.175 --> 04:52.941
is imminent.

04:53.928 --> 04:55.178
Okay. I'll get a message to Ian

04:55.179 --> 04:56.312
via the dead drop,

04:56.313 --> 04:58.330
see if I can move up
the meet to tonight.

05:03.687 --> 05:05.188
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Thank you.

05:05.189 --> 05:06.573
- Did you watch last night?
- No.

05:06.574 --> 05:08.324
- All right...
- No spoilers.

05:08.325 --> 05:10.188
Okay, you have to let
me tell you just, like...

05:10.189 --> 05:12.278
- No.
- Two words.

05:12.279 --> 05:14.781
Just... two words.

05:14.782 --> 05:17.534
Okay. Broccoli.

05:17.535 --> 05:19.452
Frosting.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.504
Get out.

05:21.505 --> 05:24.124
Oh, great. Now I'm starving again.

05:24.125 --> 05:26.009
Good morning, everybody.

05:26.010 --> 05:28.378
- Good morning.
- Morning. - Morning.

05:28.379 --> 05:31.214
Okay, I want a name.

05:31.215 --> 05:33.282
Who took the last donut?

05:36.520 --> 05:38.888
It was me, ma'am.

05:38.889 --> 05:40.140
A noble gesture, Nadine.

05:40.141 --> 05:43.476
But I didn't spend the
last 20 years in the CIA

05:43.477 --> 05:46.279
profiling dissemblers
and liars for nothing.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.829
Got anything to say, Matt?

05:49.233 --> 05:50.950
Is that a new jacket?

05:50.951 --> 05:53.203
It was a cruller, wasn't it?

05:55.573 --> 05:57.290
It was a bear claw, ma'am.

05:57.291 --> 05:58.575
Meanwhile,

05:58.576 --> 06:03.296
I have an urgent request from
President Kaimbi of Namibia.

06:03.297 --> 06:06.666
Poaching of the endangered
south-western black rhino

06:06.667 --> 06:07.884
has spiked recently

06:07.885 --> 06:09.502
in Etosha National Park.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.171
"Spiked" is putting it mildly.

06:11.172 --> 06:12.305
In 1960,

06:12.306 --> 06:13.769
there were over 100,000 in the wild.

06:13.770 --> 06:16.593
- Today, there are fewer than 2,000.
- Less a park,

06:16.594 --> 06:18.876
- more a killing field.
- Yeah, if trends continue,

06:18.877 --> 06:20.540
they'll be extinct by
the end of the year.

06:20.541 --> 06:21.648
We are officially

06:21.649 --> 06:22.816
at a tipping point.

06:22.817 --> 06:25.318
Which is why Namibia needs helicopters

06:25.319 --> 06:26.569
to fight the poachers.

06:26.570 --> 06:27.891
You know, I could check with DoD.

06:27.892 --> 06:29.395
They might have something in surplus.

06:29.396 --> 06:30.824
Yeah, do it,

06:30.825 --> 06:34.277
but is it strange that I'm
having a feeling of déjà vu?

06:34.278 --> 06:36.112
No. Last year,

06:36.113 --> 06:37.664
- Kaimbi asked for night vision goggles.
- Right.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.332
Yeah, and body armor
the year before that.

06:39.333 --> 06:40.533
So, clearly,

06:40.534 --> 06:43.203
the piecemeal fixes are not working.

06:43.204 --> 06:46.456
We need to shift the paradigm.

06:46.457 --> 06:48.925
I want bold, comprehensive ideas

06:48.926 --> 06:52.011
that are going to end this
poaching once and for all.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.297
I'll get the Africa
desk on it right away.

06:54.298 --> 06:57.100
No. You know what, go wide.

06:57.101 --> 06:58.768
- Department wide?
- I don't know.

06:58.769 --> 07:00.186
Call the NFL if you have to.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.138
I don't care where the good
idea comes from, I just want one.

07:02.139 --> 07:03.890
Will you call President Kaimbi for me?

07:03.891 --> 07:05.475
- Yes, ma'am.
- And for the love of God,

07:05.476 --> 07:07.477
- will somebody feed me?
- Yes.

07:09.000 --> 07:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:36.223 --> 07:37.340
Your camera broke.

07:37.341 --> 07:39.150
Well, I guess I'm not
a very good cyborg.

07:39.151 --> 07:40.108
You got the stuff?

07:43.347 --> 07:45.231
Thanks. Food's better

07:45.232 --> 07:46.349
at the Council of Elders,

07:46.350 --> 07:48.985
but it's still mostly based on squirrel.

07:48.986 --> 07:51.237
Look, I need a report.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.605
What's the word on the bomb?

07:52.606 --> 07:54.574
They're getting ready to use it.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.859
- What?
- Yeah, big operation.

07:56.860 --> 07:58.411
I should get more details

07:58.412 --> 08:00.762
at the Council of
Elders meeting next week.

08:01.532 --> 08:04.534
Here, I got something for you.

08:04.535 --> 08:06.869
What's this?

08:06.870 --> 08:09.372
That's from the drone.

08:09.373 --> 08:12.208
The serial number was filed off,

08:12.209 --> 08:14.260
but that model...

08:14.261 --> 08:17.297
had an ISS upgrade back in '08.

08:17.298 --> 08:19.382
I got the SKU number from the housing

08:19.383 --> 08:20.633
for the thermographic camera.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.218
Nice work.

08:22.219 --> 08:24.387
Could you have been made?

08:24.388 --> 08:26.272
Nah, man.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.024
No.

08:28.025 --> 08:30.143
They got me guarding it.

08:30.144 --> 08:31.793
You believe that?

08:34.898 --> 08:36.465
Are you okay?

08:37.201 --> 08:39.369
Yeah.

08:39.370 --> 08:40.969
Yeah...

08:44.158 --> 08:45.841
Hey, do you, uh...

08:47.461 --> 08:49.678
...do you believe in visions, Professor?

08:51.498 --> 08:54.182
Do you mean, like,
in the biblical sense?

08:54.918 --> 08:57.253
Like when Paul said he knew a man

08:57.254 --> 09:00.322
who was caught in the third heaven.

09:02.009 --> 09:05.511
I mean, is that a... a metaphor

09:05.512 --> 09:07.180
or was it real?

09:07.181 --> 09:09.599
Well, most of things referred
to as visions in the Bible

09:09.600 --> 09:11.199
are just dreams, really.

09:12.102 --> 09:14.270
Did this come up in the Council?

09:14.271 --> 09:15.605
No, no.

09:15.606 --> 09:19.442
It was... there was this kid in Iraq.

09:19.443 --> 09:21.444
He used to hang around outside our FOB

09:21.445 --> 09:24.045
selling knockoff DVDs.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.616
Aasif.

09:26.617 --> 09:28.350
Okay. What about Aasif?

09:29.787 --> 09:31.970
I thought I saw him the other day.

09:32.706 --> 09:33.873
Were you were awake?

09:33.874 --> 09:35.375
Where?

09:35.376 --> 09:36.626
I was out in the woods.

09:36.627 --> 09:38.527
It was dark.

09:41.632 --> 09:43.766
Yeah, I know, it's crazy.

09:43.767 --> 09:45.718
Have you been sick?
Have you had a fever?

09:45.719 --> 09:46.853
I can bring a medic.

09:46.854 --> 09:48.054
No.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.690
Yeah, yeah, that must
be it. The fever...

09:50.691 --> 09:53.026
sleep deprivation...

09:53.027 --> 09:54.977
Look, man, I-I got to go.

09:54.978 --> 09:57.947
I'll have the Intel,
the location of the bomb,

09:57.948 --> 09:59.065
soon as I can, okay?

09:59.066 --> 10:00.616
If anything like this happens again,

10:00.617 --> 10:02.652
I want to know immediately.

10:02.653 --> 10:03.820
You got me?

10:03.821 --> 10:05.470
You bet.

10:13.664 --> 10:14.664
Ma'am?

10:14.665 --> 10:16.082
Yes.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.934
More proposals on
stopping rhino poaching.

10:19.670 --> 10:23.339
"Tougher screening at airports,

10:23.340 --> 10:25.675
adjusting the penal code..."

10:25.676 --> 10:27.260
We've tried all...

10:27.261 --> 10:31.013
"Call in the Green Berets"?

10:31.014 --> 10:33.266
- It worked in Operation Dumbo Drop.
- Good-bye.

10:33.267 --> 10:34.817
Secure the doors! I have the windows.

10:34.818 --> 10:36.819
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on, guys?

10:36.820 --> 10:37.904
Security situation, ma'am.

10:39.356 --> 10:41.491
- Bluebird is secure.
- Ma'am.

10:41.492 --> 10:43.076
Captain Baker.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.528
What is it, Captain?

10:45.529 --> 10:47.413
We got him.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.082
We found the mole.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.966
It's happening.

11:09.686 --> 11:12.054
Barry Milken, freeze! Don't move! Hands!

11:12.055 --> 11:12.839
Show us your hands!

11:12.840 --> 11:14.700
Get your hands off the keyboard!

11:19.893 --> 11:27.021
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#33FF00"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

11:29.028 --> 11:31.943
Our mole is Barry Milken, 52,

11:31.944 --> 11:33.695
from the Bureau of Arms Control,

11:33.696 --> 11:35.363
Verification and Compliance.

11:35.364 --> 11:37.332
23-year vet of the Foreign Service,

11:37.333 --> 11:39.034
trained as a forensic accountant,

11:39.035 --> 11:41.203
holds a TS/SCI clearance.

11:41.204 --> 11:43.121
We know you deleted the manifest, Barry!

11:43.122 --> 11:44.706
- Has he asked for a lawyer?
- Not yet.

11:44.707 --> 11:46.530
I don't know what you're talking about.

11:46.531 --> 11:49.177
Violation of the Arms
Export Control Act.

11:49.178 --> 11:51.379
Destruction of federal documents.

11:51.380 --> 11:53.882
Material support for terrorism.

11:53.883 --> 11:56.885
Material support? Tell
me that's not a bluff.

11:56.886 --> 11:59.387
It's a bluff. We turned
his apartment upside down.

11:59.388 --> 12:02.023
Nothing directly connects
him to an arms ring.

12:02.024 --> 12:04.192
I don't understand. I was
just editing a spreadsheet.

12:04.193 --> 12:05.656
You're falsifying government records.

12:05.657 --> 12:07.062
You were covering up for your boss.

12:07.063 --> 12:09.114
- Who is he?
- If you tell us, you'll be out on bail

12:09.115 --> 12:11.066
before your favorite
ice cream store closes.

12:11.067 --> 12:12.234
We hear you love mint chip.

12:12.235 --> 12:14.119
I don't understand.

12:14.120 --> 12:15.787
I need to get in there.

12:15.788 --> 12:17.239
Yeah. I know the feeling.

12:17.240 --> 12:19.183
...the moment that
you start naming names.

12:19.184 --> 12:20.408
No, you can't.

12:20.409 --> 12:22.577
It's a brazen violation of procedure.

12:22.578 --> 12:25.797
Yeah. Pale face, the rapid breathing.

12:25.798 --> 12:27.415
He's probably still in shock,

12:27.416 --> 12:30.001
which means he's vulnerable
to an authority figure.

12:30.002 --> 12:33.088
I have two authority figures
in there with him right now.

12:33.089 --> 12:34.632
I'm fourth in line for the presidency,

12:34.633 --> 12:35.590
and his boss.

12:35.591 --> 12:38.260
With the right approach,
I can get him talking.

12:38.261 --> 12:40.645
Look, you just tell us
the names we want to know,

12:40.646 --> 12:42.013
and you get to go home.

12:42.014 --> 12:44.816
It is what I did at the CIA,

12:44.817 --> 12:48.085
and it's the best play and you know it.

12:51.357 --> 12:53.275
I didn't do anything wrong.

12:53.276 --> 12:54.409
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

12:54.410 --> 12:56.995
Step out of the room.

12:56.996 --> 12:58.679
What do you think they'll find?

13:10.960 --> 13:14.262
Three of us are gonna get some coffee.

13:14.263 --> 13:16.464
That'll take about five minutes.

13:16.465 --> 13:20.234
Will you get me a coffee, light? Thanks.

13:34.650 --> 13:36.484
Hey, Barry.

13:36.485 --> 13:38.737
Elizabeth.

13:38.738 --> 13:40.822
Please.

13:40.823 --> 13:44.826
I-I'm sorry we never met.

13:44.827 --> 13:47.996
Madam Secretary, this is
all a terrible mistake.

13:47.997 --> 13:51.583
I read your jacket on the way over here,

13:51.584 --> 13:53.835
and I thought your name seemed familiar.

13:53.836 --> 13:55.420
It's on a plaque, isn't it?

13:55.421 --> 13:57.005
Where were you stationed?

13:57.006 --> 13:58.890
Kenya, 1998.

13:58.891 --> 14:00.008
That's right.

14:00.009 --> 14:01.509
The embassy bombing.

14:01.510 --> 14:02.727
Yeah.

14:02.728 --> 14:04.179
You helped evacuate the injured.

14:04.180 --> 14:07.432
I-I was doing my job.

14:07.433 --> 14:10.652
Is that what it was?

14:10.653 --> 14:14.689
'Cause a guy who carries a pregnant FSO

14:14.690 --> 14:19.277
three miles to the hospital
isn't just punching a clock.

14:19.278 --> 14:22.163
He's a patriot.

14:22.164 --> 14:26.284
I don't know

14:26.285 --> 14:30.372
what you've gotten yourself
mixed up with, Barry.

14:30.373 --> 14:31.790
But I know that you...

14:31.791 --> 14:35.392
you didn't intend to
harm the United States.

14:37.630 --> 14:41.383
And you certainly never
thought anybody was gonna die.

14:41.384 --> 14:47.237
But your silence is only helping
the people who want to harm us.

14:50.559 --> 14:53.994
You go back to '98 and ask yourself...

14:55.231 --> 14:58.950
...is this the guy you wanted to be?

14:58.951 --> 15:01.403
I'm so sorry.

15:01.404 --> 15:02.654
Yeah.

15:02.655 --> 15:05.240
Madam Secretary.

15:05.241 --> 15:07.391
Step away from my client.

15:12.631 --> 15:15.065
Jim Fox? The mafia lawyer?

15:16.335 --> 15:20.922
Well, to be fair, he's also
defended celebrity killers.

15:20.923 --> 15:22.590
Well, at least they found the Stingers.

15:22.591 --> 15:23.842
But if Milken won't talk,

15:23.843 --> 15:25.927
then we'll never find out

15:25.928 --> 15:28.146
who killed Agent Garcia.

15:28.147 --> 15:31.399
That why you're stress eating?

15:31.400 --> 15:35.437
No. I spent half the day
thinking about dead rhinos.

15:35.438 --> 15:38.356
What about you? You seem... preoccupied.

15:38.357 --> 15:40.275
You mean my obsessive
tinkering with this thing

15:40.276 --> 15:43.995
as a way to avoid losing my
mind with worry over my asset?

15:43.996 --> 15:45.113
That bad, huh?

15:45.114 --> 15:46.817
And of course, it makes
me think of my dad,

15:46.818 --> 15:49.451
and how every time we
talked, we would fight.

15:49.452 --> 15:52.036
Unless we were fixing something,
then somehow, we'd get along.

15:52.037 --> 15:53.860
Y-You see, this...
welcome to my mind tonight.

15:53.861 --> 15:54.923
I can't even figure out

15:54.924 --> 15:56.624
which decade to stress out about.

15:56.625 --> 15:58.676
Why would Fox represent Milken?

15:58.677 --> 16:00.795
I don't know,

16:00.796 --> 16:02.597
because he's a fame-seeking blowhard?

16:02.598 --> 16:06.101
Well, yeah, sure, but... seems strange

16:06.102 --> 16:08.303
that he would wade into
a national security case.

16:08.304 --> 16:09.687
He never has in the past.

16:09.688 --> 16:11.306
Why now?

16:11.307 --> 16:13.641
Well, he's certainly not
doing it for the money.

16:13.642 --> 16:17.744
Milken doesn't exactly
have deep pockets.

16:18.697 --> 16:21.415
Maybe there's a man behind
the curtain who does.

16:22.067 --> 16:23.651
Mike B.?

16:23.652 --> 16:27.322
Well, if anyone can tell us

16:27.323 --> 16:32.794
who hired Jim Fox to
represent Milken, it's Mike.

16:32.795 --> 16:38.333
Well, um, if I may, ma'am, why
don't you call him yourself?

16:38.334 --> 16:41.419
Because, frankly, he'd
rather hear from you.

16:41.420 --> 16:43.087
He asks about you, you know.

16:43.088 --> 16:44.172
Does he?

16:44.173 --> 16:45.673
Constantly.

16:45.674 --> 16:47.342
Good morning, everybody, oh...

16:47.343 --> 16:49.260
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Ah. Ha, ha.

16:49.261 --> 16:51.095
Quick rhino update.

16:51.096 --> 16:54.186
So we've officially requested
half a dozen OH-58 Kiowas...

16:54.187 --> 16:55.013
Great.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.985
...for Namibia under the
Defense Articles Program.

16:56.986 --> 16:59.027
All right. What are
the odds of approval?

16:59.028 --> 17:01.051
Well, there's a couple
hundred gathering dust

17:01.052 --> 17:02.690
in Afghanistan, so pretty good.

17:02.691 --> 17:04.776
Who's the, uh, new kid?

17:04.777 --> 17:07.278
This is Gwen White, from the
Office of Health Diplomacy.

17:07.279 --> 17:09.364
- Hi.
- Um, Madam Secretary.

17:09.365 --> 17:11.499
Hi, uh, thank you for having me.

17:11.500 --> 17:14.536
Well, I assume there's a
good reason for having you?

17:14.537 --> 17:16.037
I hope so.

17:16.038 --> 17:18.756
Ms. White has a rather unorthodox idea

17:18.757 --> 17:22.260
about how we can address
the rhino poaching crisis.

17:22.261 --> 17:25.096
Right, but I don't want to
waste anyone's time, so...

17:25.097 --> 17:26.714
Mm! I'm all ears. Please.

17:28.017 --> 17:32.187
Okay. So the fight against
poaching can't be solved

17:32.188 --> 17:34.131
with enforcement alone.
We have to reduce demand.

17:35.891 --> 17:37.358
In the case of rhino horn,

17:37.359 --> 17:39.694
the market is mostly concentrated here.

17:39.695 --> 17:40.728
In Vietnam.

17:42.231 --> 17:43.414
Oh, your thing... Your thing.

17:43.415 --> 17:45.283
Sorry. I had a pie chart for that.

17:45.284 --> 17:46.618
Fine. Why Vietnam?

17:46.619 --> 17:48.820
Because traditional folklore holds that

17:48.821 --> 17:50.405
the black rhino horn

17:50.406 --> 17:52.957
has a wide range of curative properties,

17:52.958 --> 17:54.667
including troubles with impotence.

17:54.668 --> 17:55.918
Which it doesn't, I assume.

17:55.919 --> 17:57.587
The horn is just keratin, so, you know,

17:57.588 --> 18:00.533
it's about as effective as
chewing on your fingernails.

18:02.426 --> 18:06.846
Meanwhile, we have actual
pharmaceuticals that work.

18:06.847 --> 18:08.681
PDE inhibitors, like Viagra.

18:08.682 --> 18:11.401
So if we can educate
the Vietnamese people

18:11.402 --> 18:13.102
about these alternatives...

18:13.103 --> 18:16.689
we can reduce the demand for rhino horn.

18:16.690 --> 18:18.909
Thereby undercutting
the gangs and, long-term,

18:18.910 --> 18:20.243
maybe end the poaching.

18:20.244 --> 18:21.611
So basically, you're talking

18:21.612 --> 18:23.780
- about a public health campaign.
- Yes, ma'am.

18:23.781 --> 18:26.115
Ideally, coupled with a
drug distribution program.

18:26.116 --> 18:27.834
So we can save the rhinos

18:27.835 --> 18:29.368
by pushing Viagra?

18:29.369 --> 18:30.870
Yeah.

18:30.871 --> 18:32.755
Admittedly, it's a small step,

18:32.756 --> 18:34.332
and it seems farfetched, but...

18:34.333 --> 18:36.204
I think it's brilliant.

18:36.205 --> 18:37.593
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:37.594 --> 18:39.404
I actually had the idea
a couple of years ago,

18:39.405 --> 18:42.440
but given the subject matter,
I was, uh, a little reluctant.

18:42.441 --> 18:47.862
I-I want you to pitch
this to Ambassador Dang.

18:47.863 --> 18:51.082
Blake is gonna help you

18:51.083 --> 18:53.117
- with the PowerPoint.
- Yes.

18:53.118 --> 18:54.669
And I'll get a celebrity spokesperson.

18:54.670 --> 18:56.287
And I'll tackle Big Pharma.

18:56.288 --> 18:57.455
I'll write the copy.

18:57.456 --> 18:59.090
Let's go, people. Shake a leg.

18:59.091 --> 19:00.541
Let's all hope Ambassador Dang

19:00.542 --> 19:03.477
rises to the occasion.

19:09.635 --> 19:12.053
Hey.

19:12.054 --> 19:13.221
What's up?

19:13.222 --> 19:14.689
DoD is still trying to track down

19:14.690 --> 19:16.391
that SKU number that Ian gave us.

19:16.392 --> 19:18.726
They're looking at military depots.

19:18.727 --> 19:21.779
Cool. I'm more worried about
Ian getting a 20 on the bomb.

19:21.780 --> 19:24.399
About that...

19:24.400 --> 19:26.401
That's the drink I gave Ian last night.

19:26.402 --> 19:27.785
I want his saliva tested.

19:27.786 --> 19:29.320
What for?

19:29.321 --> 19:30.738
Drugs.

19:30.739 --> 19:32.373
Psychotropics, to be specific.

19:32.374 --> 19:34.909
He seemed disoriented.

19:34.910 --> 19:36.244
Slow responses, jittery.

19:36.245 --> 19:38.246
Well, that could be a number of things.

19:38.247 --> 19:40.915
A lot of religious cults
give drugs to their adherents.

19:40.916 --> 19:42.299
It makes neophytes more compliant,

19:42.300 --> 19:44.419
more receptive to doctrine.

19:44.420 --> 19:46.137
But in this case, I
think it's a privilege

19:46.138 --> 19:47.672
reserved for the inner circle.

19:47.673 --> 19:50.591
A way of giving them a spiritual edge

19:50.592 --> 19:51.843
on the other followers.

19:51.844 --> 19:52.927
The Council of Elders.

19:52.928 --> 19:54.429
Timing works.

19:54.430 --> 19:55.930
But no outbursts?

19:55.931 --> 19:58.004
Screaming, hearing
voices. Anything like that?

19:58.005 --> 19:59.684
Not that he mentioned, but he did say...

19:59.685 --> 20:02.103
The guy is a marine. Henry.
Eight years, three tours.

20:02.104 --> 20:03.688
I know all about the Marines, Mo.

20:03.689 --> 20:04.772
The point is,

20:04.773 --> 20:06.023
this is not a guy who cracks.

20:06.024 --> 20:07.692
Is he a guy who hallucinates?

20:07.693 --> 20:08.943
Because he told me

20:08.944 --> 20:11.112
he saw a kid that he knew in Iraq.

20:11.113 --> 20:13.030
Wow.

20:13.031 --> 20:14.449
Okay.

20:14.450 --> 20:18.369
Say we send it in, and
it comes back positive.

20:18.370 --> 20:20.671
They're gonna order us to pull him.

20:20.672 --> 20:21.789
With good reason.

20:21.790 --> 20:23.624
Are you really gonna take that chance

20:23.625 --> 20:25.960
when we're this close to the finish?

20:33.635 --> 20:34.802
I can't believe...

20:34.803 --> 20:37.138
- Did you see that...
- Oh, come on. Seriously?

20:37.139 --> 20:39.690
- Aw. Hi. Mwah.
- Hey.

20:39.691 --> 20:41.642
How were the cupcakes tonight?

20:41.643 --> 20:44.479
"Cakey." So said the guest judge,

20:44.480 --> 20:46.063
the guy who played Gunther on Friends.

20:46.064 --> 20:47.448
How's your engine?

20:47.449 --> 20:50.151
I feel like Han Solo trying
to start the Millennium Falcon.

20:50.152 --> 20:53.121
Yeah, try watching grown
women fight over sprinkles.

20:53.122 --> 20:54.989
- Oh, shut up. You love it.
- No. I don't...

20:54.990 --> 20:57.375
Oh, wait. I'm sorry. By
the way, I almost forgot.

20:57.376 --> 20:59.377
There is an entire thread

20:59.378 --> 21:00.828
for tips on this thing.

21:01.964 --> 21:03.464
Thanks, Jace.

21:03.465 --> 21:06.050
Hello?

21:06.051 --> 21:07.767
Jim Fox is here?

21:11.723 --> 21:13.641
Madam Secretary.

21:13.642 --> 21:15.760
Who hired you to represent my employee?

21:15.761 --> 21:17.512
They told me you were direct.

21:17.513 --> 21:19.180
Oh, well, unlike you,

21:19.181 --> 21:21.315
I don't get paid by the hour.

21:21.316 --> 21:24.268
Whereas venal and malicious
bureaucrats can take their time.

21:24.269 --> 21:25.987
Who sent you?

21:25.988 --> 21:27.688
Lady Justice, as far
as you're concerned.

21:27.689 --> 21:30.191
And I know that your little
attack dog, Mike Barnow,

21:30.192 --> 21:32.193
has been sniffing around,
trying to get dirt on me.

21:32.194 --> 21:33.661
Not dirt, just an understanding

21:33.662 --> 21:35.436
of your involvement in the Milken case.

21:35.437 --> 21:36.113
Sure, sure.

21:36.114 --> 21:38.082
Speaking of which, the attorney general

21:38.083 --> 21:40.168
will want your opinion on it.

21:40.169 --> 21:41.285
Tell him to make the deal.

21:41.286 --> 21:43.788
You're asking for immunity?

21:43.789 --> 21:46.257
- Iron-clad and unqualified.
- It'll never happen.

21:46.258 --> 21:47.875
The alternative is a lengthy trial,

21:47.876 --> 21:50.678
which won't go well for you.

21:50.679 --> 21:52.395
Is that a threat?

21:54.516 --> 21:56.217
A mole inside the State Department

21:56.218 --> 21:57.552
right under your nose?

21:57.553 --> 21:59.786
You give me a platform,
and I'll savage you

21:59.787 --> 22:01.778
- like a lion ripping apart...
- Good night.

22:01.779 --> 22:03.294
Do you know the difference between

22:03.295 --> 22:04.597
- you and me?
- Pleasure.

22:04.650 --> 22:06.592
Is that you have something
greater to protect.

22:06.593 --> 22:08.727
Me, I'm fine with burning it down.

22:08.728 --> 22:11.946
You need me more than I need you.

22:19.240 --> 22:22.342
Mr. Attorney General,
it kills me to say this,

22:22.343 --> 22:24.795
but I think Jim Fox is right.

22:24.796 --> 22:26.246
What, make the deal?

22:26.247 --> 22:27.914
You're really gonna let him bully you?

22:27.915 --> 22:30.250
No, I could care less
about his bullying.

22:30.251 --> 22:32.686
Him dragging this out
is what concerns me.

22:32.687 --> 22:34.004
A trial could go how long?

22:34.005 --> 22:36.256
Ten months, maybe a year.

22:36.257 --> 22:37.257
That we're in the dark.

22:37.258 --> 22:38.892
It's really a question of scope.

22:38.893 --> 22:40.894
Mr. Milken committed a serious crime.

22:40.895 --> 22:42.646
Only vital, actionable intelligence

22:42.647 --> 22:44.431
can justify an immunity deal.

22:44.432 --> 22:46.150
Which we have no guarantee we'd get.

22:46.151 --> 22:47.830
We could be letting
a murderer walk free.

22:47.831 --> 22:49.936
According to the FBI's timeline,

22:49.937 --> 22:53.940
Barry Milken was nowhere
near Agent Garcia's house

22:53.941 --> 22:56.044
- during the poisoning window.
- So he hired someone.

22:56.045 --> 22:57.911
He doesn't exactly fit the profile

22:57.912 --> 23:00.363
of a criminal mastermind.

23:00.364 --> 23:01.782
I have a source who spoke with

23:01.783 --> 23:03.834
my chief of staff this morning.

23:03.835 --> 23:05.202
Jim Fox was paid

23:05.203 --> 23:07.454
to take this case... mid-six figures

23:07.455 --> 23:09.539
- just for the retainer.
- What source?

23:09.540 --> 23:12.042
The point is there's a
bigger fish out there,

23:12.043 --> 23:15.970
and Barry Milken is the guy
who can tell us how to find him.

23:17.298 --> 23:20.282
I'll let you know my decision.

23:21.238 --> 23:22.719
As you can see, Minister Dang,

23:22.720 --> 23:24.903
the majority of demand comes
from middle-aged urban men

23:24.904 --> 23:27.057
who still believe that
rhino horn produces

23:27.058 --> 23:28.558
enhanced sexual function.

23:28.559 --> 23:30.694
Which is why we're proposing
a targeted ad campaign,

23:30.695 --> 23:32.198
fully funded by the State Department.

23:32.199 --> 23:34.314
And endorsed by Henry Winkler.

23:34.315 --> 23:36.316
- Aaayyh!
- The Fonz?

23:36.317 --> 23:38.034
Really?

23:38.035 --> 23:40.203
- Will he come to Vietnam?
- He'll have to.

23:40.204 --> 23:42.572
The entire campaign
will be produced and shot

23:42.573 --> 23:44.324
by your local media companies,

23:44.325 --> 23:46.543
providing a boost to your
entertainment industry.

23:46.544 --> 23:48.044
And paired with the actress

23:48.045 --> 23:51.548
Linh Ky, who just happens to
be the prime minister's wife,

23:51.549 --> 23:54.167
we think this campaign
will make a sizeable impact.

23:54.168 --> 23:55.418
So to speak.

23:55.419 --> 23:57.304
Now, with your permission,

23:57.305 --> 24:00.439
Let's talk about your
end of the partnership.

24:02.510 --> 24:04.276
The Fonz.

24:05.897 --> 24:07.180
You struck out?

24:07.181 --> 24:09.633
Seriously?

24:09.634 --> 24:11.268
Ambassador Dang refused the ad campaign,

24:11.269 --> 24:13.637
unless we can subsidize the ED drugs.

24:13.638 --> 24:16.022
And Big Pharma won't cut their rates

24:16.023 --> 24:17.324
to an emerging market.

24:17.325 --> 24:19.326
I did paint slash effects
and morph transitions.

24:19.327 --> 24:20.990
I really thought The
Fonz would clinch it.

24:20.991 --> 24:22.579
He was humming the theme song.

24:22.580 --> 24:24.865
Well, apparently Happy Days
can't beat cold, hard cash.

24:24.866 --> 24:26.950
- So to speak.
- Well, can we just

24:26.951 --> 24:29.035
buy the medication and give it to them?

24:29.036 --> 24:31.504
We can barely afford
to run the ad campaign.

24:31.505 --> 24:34.875
I hate to pile on, but
we just got a communiqué

24:34.876 --> 24:36.760
from the World Wildlife Fund.

24:36.761 --> 24:39.045
Another 16 black rhinos were slaughtered

24:39.046 --> 24:40.130
in Etosha last night.

24:40.131 --> 24:42.382
That's almost 1% of the population.

24:42.383 --> 24:45.302
Forget a year, we're
talking population collapse

24:45.303 --> 24:46.720
the next three to six months.

24:46.721 --> 24:48.801
Can you at least tell
me that the Pentagon

24:48.802 --> 24:50.039
approved those helicopters?

24:50.040 --> 24:51.808
They did, but it's gonna take

24:51.809 --> 24:53.592
another three to four
months to deliver them.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.612
Months?

24:55.613 --> 24:57.480
They know they can fly, right?

24:57.481 --> 24:59.566
Apparently, there's a
lot of steps involved.

24:59.567 --> 25:02.202
How many steps can there be?

25:02.203 --> 25:04.454
Seven departments, three agencies,

25:04.455 --> 25:06.072
and more than a dozen deputies

25:06.073 --> 25:07.407
at the Office of General Counsel.

25:07.408 --> 25:12.579
Wow, that's... thorough.

25:12.580 --> 25:14.974
I'm sorry, Madam Secretary,
but here at Defense

25:14.975 --> 25:16.638
we have to make sure
our equipment doesn't

25:16.639 --> 25:18.301
fall into the wrong hands.

25:18.302 --> 25:21.588
But this is a transfer of
non-lethal surplus equipment

25:21.589 --> 25:23.089
on humanitarian grounds.

25:23.090 --> 25:25.425
Those choppers can still be armed.

25:25.426 --> 25:27.093
And last time I checked,

25:27.094 --> 25:28.261
rhinos weren't people.

25:28.262 --> 25:31.264
The syndicate behind
the slaughter in Namibia,

25:31.265 --> 25:34.067
it's destabilizing regimes
throughout the continent,

25:34.068 --> 25:36.736
spreading terrorism in its wake.

25:36.737 --> 25:37.938
Trust me,

25:37.939 --> 25:40.607
plenty of people are
suffering because of this.

25:40.608 --> 25:42.108
My hands are tied.

25:42.109 --> 25:44.861
These are laws enacted by Congress.

25:44.862 --> 25:46.605
And personally, I'd
prefer not to get hauled

25:46.606 --> 25:47.824
in front of a Senate hearing.

25:53.671 --> 25:54.871
More cupcake carnage?

25:54.872 --> 25:58.258
I don't even know why
I'm still watching.

25:58.259 --> 26:00.627
Those grandmas are nothing more than

26:00.628 --> 26:03.129
a bunch of back-stabbing harpies.

26:03.130 --> 26:04.547
Bad day?

26:04.548 --> 26:06.516
What, I can't dis the
elderly when I'm happy?

26:06.517 --> 26:08.184
You can dis, you can dis.

26:08.185 --> 26:11.855
The south-western black
rhino is going extinct,

26:11.856 --> 26:13.390
and I can't even get the Pentagon

26:13.391 --> 26:17.110
to send a few lousy choppers
to stop the massacre.

26:17.111 --> 26:19.161
Hmm. Gotta love bureaucracy.

26:20.197 --> 26:23.149
You ever tattle in school?

26:23.150 --> 26:25.819
Uh, probably. Why?

26:25.820 --> 26:28.053
I did.

26:30.374 --> 26:31.791
Mikey Finn, first grade.

26:31.792 --> 26:34.294
I told Mrs. Shaheen that
he was stealing answers

26:34.295 --> 26:35.518
from me for the spelling test,

26:35.519 --> 26:38.581
and she told me to cover my paper

26:38.582 --> 26:40.333
and mind my own business.

26:40.334 --> 26:42.585
You want to involve Dalton.

26:42.586 --> 26:44.421
He could sign a presidential waiver,

26:44.422 --> 26:46.806
and the helicopters
would be there tomorrow.

26:46.807 --> 26:48.790
Which would be going
outside the chain of command.

26:48.791 --> 26:52.395
And we can't run a government
by presidential fiat.

26:52.396 --> 26:55.682
If you can effect real
change by going to teacher,

26:55.683 --> 26:57.017
I say go for it.

26:57.018 --> 26:59.602
Thank you.

26:59.603 --> 27:04.074
You know, sometimes doing
the right thing... sucks.

27:04.075 --> 27:05.859
Really.

27:10.698 --> 27:13.416
The attorney general made a deal.

27:13.417 --> 27:15.869
Barry Milken is being released
on bail tomorrow morning.

27:15.870 --> 27:17.420
He can be talking by noon.

27:17.421 --> 27:18.621
Now, you see that?

27:18.622 --> 27:19.873
You wait around long enough,

27:19.874 --> 27:22.175
something good is bound to happen.

27:22.176 --> 27:25.561
Come on, cupcakes.

27:32.970 --> 27:34.888
- Is that...
- Yeah.

27:34.889 --> 27:36.723
- Ah.
- Broccoli frosting.

27:36.724 --> 27:38.040
Ugh.

27:39.226 --> 27:41.326
She's eating it. She's eating it.

27:55.571 --> 27:57.214
Daisy.

27:57.215 --> 27:59.079
- Hey.
- I heard about the deal.

27:59.080 --> 28:04.968
Yeah, I was thinking
that must be upsetting.

28:04.969 --> 28:06.252
It's really not.

28:06.253 --> 28:08.254
If Milken can tell the FBI

28:08.255 --> 28:09.672
who killed the man I knew as Kevin,

28:09.673 --> 28:11.274
then that's a good thing.

28:11.275 --> 28:12.858
If he ever stops posing for the camera.

28:12.859 --> 28:13.893
What do you mean?

28:13.894 --> 28:16.062
Jim Fox is holding a press
conference with Milken

28:16.063 --> 28:18.284
- outside of the Justice Department.
- Of course he is.

28:18.285 --> 28:19.899
Can you turn it up?

28:19.900 --> 28:21.763
Well, I'm just glad that
the attorney general's

28:21.764 --> 28:24.104
taken a break, finally,
from wasting tax-payer money,

28:24.105 --> 28:27.574
because he had no chance,
zero, of getting a conviction.

28:27.575 --> 28:29.003
That's not what DOJ said.

28:29.004 --> 28:30.994
Of course not, because when has the FBI

28:30.995 --> 28:32.412
ever acted unethically?

28:32.413 --> 28:34.948
My client got full
immunity. You do the math.

28:34.949 --> 28:36.866
Mr. Milken, how does it feel to be free?

28:36.867 --> 28:38.785
He's thrilled, and can't wait to share

28:38.786 --> 28:40.286
whatever he can with the authorities.

28:40.287 --> 28:41.990
Which is what he wanted
in the first place.

28:41.991 --> 28:43.506
Thanks, guys. Come on, let's go.

28:43.507 --> 28:44.850
Can we get a statement?

28:44.851 --> 28:46.876
No more questions. No more questions.

28:46.877 --> 28:48.845
You just heard from Jim Fox,

28:48.846 --> 28:51.347
the attorney representing
State Department employee

28:51.348 --> 28:53.766
Barry Milken, who was detained
on several classified...

28:56.020 --> 28:58.054
Shots... uh, shots have been fired.

28:58.055 --> 28:59.355
It appears that...

28:59.356 --> 29:01.975
it appears that Mr.
Milken has been shot.

29:01.976 --> 29:05.160
Barry Milken has been shot.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.204
Ian tested positive
for dimethyltryptamine.

29:17.205 --> 29:20.081
- What?
- It's a form of LSD.

29:20.082 --> 29:21.249
Where did you get this?

29:21.250 --> 29:23.084
I took it to a private lab.

29:23.085 --> 29:24.719
- You went behind my back?
- Yeah.

29:24.720 --> 29:28.139
And how confident are you
that this test is accurate?

29:28.140 --> 29:32.644
Well, they used LCMS, and
they did it twice, so very.

29:32.645 --> 29:35.263
It's likely been in small doses so far,

29:35.264 --> 29:36.567
probably mixed in with his food,

29:36.568 --> 29:37.932
but the effect is cumulative.

29:37.933 --> 29:40.185
Ian's symptoms could be
about to get much worse.

29:40.186 --> 29:42.487
Okay, so he had a bad
episode here and there.

29:42.488 --> 29:44.739
No. There's reasons the CIA experimented

29:44.740 --> 29:46.274
with LSD in the '50s.

29:46.275 --> 29:49.777
Because under interrogation, it
leaves some people vulnerable.

29:49.778 --> 29:51.196
Ian's cover could be blown.

29:51.197 --> 29:53.448
We staged a car
accident with a dead body

29:53.449 --> 29:55.089
to get him to where he is now...

29:55.090 --> 29:56.539
And there's a high-capacity bomb

29:56.540 --> 29:58.501
that could kill hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds

29:58.502 --> 29:59.210
that we haven't located.

29:59.211 --> 30:00.955
I'm with you, Mo. Until a few days ago

30:00.956 --> 30:03.625
I would have done anything
to keep this mission in play.

30:03.626 --> 30:06.202
But we can't leave a compromised asset

30:06.203 --> 30:07.125
in the lion's den.

30:08.228 --> 30:09.631
You're pulling Ian.

30:09.632 --> 30:11.382
Tomorrow night at the meet.

30:11.383 --> 30:14.451
If you don't like it, take
it up with the director.

30:24.280 --> 30:25.813
Hey, what's this?

30:25.814 --> 30:28.566
I found your multimeter in the basement.

30:28.567 --> 30:29.883
I hope that's okay.

30:30.819 --> 30:32.570
What?

30:32.571 --> 30:34.322
I just don't remember even teaching you

30:34.323 --> 30:36.475
- how to use a multimeter.
- Yeah, I used YouTube.

30:36.476 --> 30:38.899
I mean, I was just wondering...
what if it's not you?

30:38.900 --> 30:40.045
Because, like, I know this is hard,

30:40.046 --> 30:41.286
and you're old and incompetent,

30:41.287 --> 30:42.630
but just check this out, hold on.

30:46.969 --> 30:49.137
I'll be damned. It's a bad distributor.

30:49.138 --> 30:50.471
Yeah, so the circuit can't close.

30:50.472 --> 30:51.839
You're welcome.

30:51.840 --> 30:53.141
We need a replacement part.

30:53.142 --> 30:54.726
You do. My work is done here.

30:54.727 --> 30:56.928
Hey, come on, you're
part of the team now.

30:56.929 --> 30:58.513
Don't you want to help me fix it?

30:58.514 --> 31:00.932
Uh, no. I want...

31:00.933 --> 31:03.685
lift tickets to Elk
Mountain this weekend.

31:03.686 --> 31:04.852
Dashiell invited me.

31:04.853 --> 31:07.155
Okay, all right, well,
I guess you earned it.

31:07.156 --> 31:08.907
Awesome.

31:08.908 --> 31:13.111
Oh, uh, do you want me to put
that back in the dining room?

31:13.112 --> 31:15.830
No, it's fine.

31:15.831 --> 31:18.499
Good night, Jace.

31:18.500 --> 31:20.467
Good night, old man.

31:27.793 --> 31:30.345
The sniper was positioned
in a vacant apartment,

31:30.346 --> 31:33.181
approximately 300 yards from the target.

31:33.182 --> 31:36.050
We believe he escaped through
the Navy Memorial Metro Station

31:36.051 --> 31:37.969
before a perimeter could be established.

31:37.970 --> 31:39.304
Well, what about CCTV?

31:39.305 --> 31:41.055
Well, they're reviewing
footage now, sir,

31:41.056 --> 31:44.442
but most of the cameras
were disabled beforehand.

31:44.443 --> 31:47.478
Then this'll be a
short press conference.

31:47.479 --> 31:49.364
Five minutes, Mr. President.

31:49.365 --> 31:52.066
Thanks, Lucy.

31:52.067 --> 31:54.702
Did Milken say anything
before he was killed?

31:54.703 --> 31:57.205
No, sir. The deal was
that he get released first.

31:57.206 --> 31:58.573
Where does that leave us?

31:58.574 --> 32:00.875
I'm afraid back to square one.

32:00.876 --> 32:02.577
Well, keep me apprised
of any developments.

32:02.578 --> 32:04.212
I want this to remain a priority.

32:04.213 --> 32:05.163
Yes, sir.

32:05.164 --> 32:07.514
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

32:13.172 --> 32:14.922
Bess.

32:14.923 --> 32:19.260
Well, I know the timing isn't
great, but I need to talk to you

32:19.261 --> 32:23.765
about the south-western
black rhinoceros.

32:23.766 --> 32:25.149
You went over my head!

32:25.150 --> 32:28.519
Shattering decades of protocol,

32:28.520 --> 32:31.739
all for some dumb mammals my
grandkids can see at the zoo!

32:31.740 --> 32:34.158
Well, that'll be the only
place they can see them

32:34.159 --> 32:36.742
- at the rate we're going.
- It's an abuse of an executive order.

32:36.743 --> 32:38.746
Waiver, technically,
and it was an emergency.

32:38.747 --> 32:40.164
It's your pet rock, I get it,

32:40.165 --> 32:43.751
but you don't just throw
it through my office window.

32:43.752 --> 32:46.423
Do you have any idea
who you're messing with?

32:46.424 --> 32:50.260
How many of your department's
projects I can kill

32:50.261 --> 32:51.294
with the stroke of a pen?

32:51.295 --> 32:53.463
- Thousands, probably.
- Thousands.

32:53.464 --> 32:55.966
Our government only works
when we operate in tandem.

32:55.967 --> 32:58.018
- You're right.
- And this sort of petty overreach

32:58.019 --> 32:59.602
could destroy our working relationship.

32:59.603 --> 33:01.980
Gordon, I'm agreeing with you.

33:01.981 --> 33:05.058
Pulling rank to save
an endangered species

33:05.059 --> 33:06.943
is not sustainable...

33:06.944 --> 33:09.062
ironic as that may seem.

33:09.063 --> 33:10.480
That's why I have a proposal

33:10.481 --> 33:12.816
to ensure that it never happens again,

33:12.817 --> 33:15.301
but for that I need your help.

34:42.083 --> 34:43.324
Henry, oh, my God.

34:43.324 --> 34:45.386
Hey, babe. Hi.

34:45.387 --> 34:46.387
Hey.

34:46.388 --> 34:47.987
- Hey, tell me you're okay?
- All good.

34:47.989 --> 34:49.406
The ankle's a through and through

34:49.407 --> 34:52.326
and this other one is just a ricochet.

34:52.327 --> 34:53.659
That fractured your knee.

34:53.661 --> 34:56.079
Well, it was a clean break. I'm okay.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.165
- Well, you better be.
- I'm fine.

34:58.166 --> 35:00.334
Henry, when are you gonna get a desk job

35:00.335 --> 35:01.535
that involves a real desk?

35:01.536 --> 35:02.703
Well, they offered me a cubicle,

35:02.704 --> 35:04.807
but I was gonna hold out
for something with a window.

35:04.808 --> 35:05.839
You think this is funny?

35:05.840 --> 35:08.140
Henry, you got shot.

35:09.711 --> 35:11.345
Babe, it's fine.

35:11.346 --> 35:14.047
What am I gonna tell the kids?

35:14.048 --> 35:16.016
Tell them I got in a car accident.

35:16.017 --> 35:17.360
No, I don't mean the cover story.

35:17.361 --> 35:18.936
I mean if you get killed.

35:18.937 --> 35:20.960
I'll have to explain to
them that their dad thought

35:20.961 --> 35:23.390
it was a good idea to
throw himself in harm's way.

35:23.391 --> 35:24.892
I didn't throw myself anywhere.

35:24.893 --> 35:27.052
We had no reason to believe
this meet was compromised.

35:27.053 --> 35:28.135
That's a minor technicality

35:28.136 --> 35:29.679
if the bullet had landed in your head.

35:29.680 --> 35:30.574
Okay.

35:30.575 --> 35:31.899
I was asked to manage an asset

35:31.900 --> 35:33.951
to help stop another
domestic terror attack.

35:33.952 --> 35:35.786
I can't do that from behind a desk.

35:35.787 --> 35:37.905
If you think I should quit,

35:37.906 --> 35:39.039
then just say it.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.290
I think you should quit.

35:40.291 --> 35:42.709
With my asset in danger?

35:42.710 --> 35:44.578
- With VFF on the verge of a major attack?
- Compound's surrounded.

35:44.579 --> 35:46.957
- The threat is contained. It's over.
- No, it's not.

35:46.958 --> 35:48.916
We got a SKU number off
the thermographic camera.

35:48.917 --> 35:51.418
It goes back to a
military depot in Texas,

35:51.419 --> 35:54.054
so God knows how much more
military hardware they have.

35:54.055 --> 35:56.840
Why not use the serial numbers?

35:56.841 --> 35:58.926
- What?
- On the drone.

35:58.927 --> 36:01.511
Every piece of military equipment

36:01.512 --> 36:02.980
has a unique serial number.

36:02.981 --> 36:04.231
Yeah, the number was filed off,

36:04.232 --> 36:06.733
but it was a retrofit back in '08...

36:06.734 --> 36:10.687
The weapons that we're looking
for, they fit that pattern.

36:10.688 --> 36:13.523
All the serial numbers are filed off.

36:13.524 --> 36:16.026
Every time we tried to trace
them back, it was a dead end.

36:16.027 --> 36:18.445
In that depot, what
else is in that depot?

36:18.446 --> 36:20.614
Humvees, tanks, heavy munitions.

36:20.615 --> 36:21.615
Stinger missiles?

36:21.616 --> 36:24.383
Depleted uranium?

36:26.254 --> 36:28.304
We're looking for the same supplier.

36:30.541 --> 36:32.793
Elizabeth, how's Henry?

36:32.794 --> 36:34.294
He-He's recovering, sir.

36:34.295 --> 36:36.176
He tried to drag himself
here from the hospital.

36:36.177 --> 36:37.728
Of course he did. What's
the latest on the drone?

36:37.729 --> 36:40.050
It was traced to a depot in
Corpus Christi, Texas, sir.

36:40.051 --> 36:41.435
The same facility

36:41.436 --> 36:43.637
also received shipments
of uranium, tank shells,

36:43.638 --> 36:45.138
and another recent item of note.

36:45.139 --> 36:46.974
Stinger missiles.

36:46.975 --> 36:48.025
This is it.

36:48.026 --> 36:49.559
Ground zero for the smuggling ring

36:49.560 --> 36:51.061
and the whole conspiracy.

36:51.062 --> 36:52.779
And whoever's running it

36:52.780 --> 36:55.399
has access to unlimited supply
of military-grade weapons.

36:55.400 --> 36:56.984
And selling to the highest bidder.

36:56.985 --> 36:59.369
Do we know what else is missing?

36:59.370 --> 37:01.583
- No, sir, and that's what scares me.
- Shut it down.

37:01.584 --> 37:02.990
Question everyone who works there.

37:02.991 --> 37:04.992
I want every bullet and
ball bearing accounted for.

37:04.993 --> 37:06.076
Already into it, sir.

37:06.077 --> 37:07.494
Bureau's on alert, Mr. President.

37:07.495 --> 37:09.746
CIA has every analyst with
a pulse working overtime.

37:09.747 --> 37:12.132
And tell DHS to put out a
National Terrorism Bulletin.

37:12.133 --> 37:14.751
I want every county, city,
and town across the country

37:14.752 --> 37:15.836
prepared in case of attack.

37:15.837 --> 37:18.571
Yes, sir.

37:27.348 --> 37:30.734
Mr. Secretary, you get my proposal?

37:30.735 --> 37:32.069
About the rhino program?

37:32.070 --> 37:35.906
Yeah, but kind of busy with
a renegade depot right now.

37:35.907 --> 37:37.240
You liked it, didn't you?

37:39.077 --> 37:42.029
It was a good PowerPoint.

37:42.030 --> 37:45.615
All right, but we're
gonna need tangible results

37:45.616 --> 37:46.867
if it's gonna continue.

37:46.868 --> 37:49.670
I owe you one.

37:49.671 --> 37:51.854
Yes, you do, Madam Secretary.

38:00.598 --> 38:02.948
How'd you find me?

38:04.052 --> 38:06.436
Your hobby's an open secret.

38:06.437 --> 38:09.056
It's competition in its purest form.

38:09.057 --> 38:10.891
The weak get shunted aside.

38:10.892 --> 38:12.809
Relaxes me.

38:12.810 --> 38:15.612
I have nothing to say to you or the FBI.

38:15.613 --> 38:17.814
No, no, no, you misunderstand.

38:17.815 --> 38:21.201
I'm here to offer my sympathy.

38:21.202 --> 38:24.821
I know what it's like watching
someone die in front of you,

38:24.822 --> 38:27.407
thinking, on some level,
it's all your fault.

38:27.408 --> 38:29.710
Excuse me? How is any of this my fault?

38:29.711 --> 38:34.131
You were hired for the single
purpose of getting Barry Milken

38:34.132 --> 38:36.416
out of custody so your
employer could have him killed.

38:36.417 --> 38:39.252
Saying I got played?

38:39.253 --> 38:41.520
Like a cheap kazoo.

38:43.558 --> 38:47.260
And instead of fighting
back, you're sitting here

38:47.261 --> 38:49.361
feeding the pigeons.

38:52.100 --> 38:54.317
I'm not afraid of anybody.

38:54.318 --> 38:57.703
Tell it to the birds.

38:59.941 --> 39:04.510
Or better yet, tell me who hired you.

39:20.628 --> 39:22.796
Uh, you wanted to see me, ma'am?

39:22.797 --> 39:24.714
Yeah.

39:24.715 --> 39:28.268
I wanted to tell you in person

39:28.269 --> 39:29.936
that your proposal is officially a go.

39:29.937 --> 39:33.807
What? How did we... uh, I
mean, you afford the pills?

39:33.808 --> 39:35.225
The secretary of defense

39:35.226 --> 39:39.813
found money in his
global contingency fund.

39:39.814 --> 39:42.115
Ambassador Dang just
okayed the pilot program.

39:42.116 --> 39:47.370
Oh, ma'am, this is... oh, wow.

39:47.371 --> 39:52.993
Next time, Gwen, don't
wait for an invitation.

39:52.994 --> 39:56.830
You sat on this proposal for how long?

39:56.831 --> 39:58.131
Two years.

39:58.132 --> 40:03.170
A good idea is meaningless
without the courage to act.

40:03.171 --> 40:07.257
You must speak up.

40:07.258 --> 40:09.759
Yes, ma'am.

40:09.760 --> 40:11.261
Um, will that be all?

40:11.262 --> 40:12.479
N-No.

40:12.480 --> 40:14.931
- Oh.
- I'm appointing you

40:14.932 --> 40:18.268
principal deputy coordinator
to the ambassador-at-large

40:18.269 --> 40:20.353
for global health diplomacy.

40:20.354 --> 40:23.073
But that means...

40:23.074 --> 40:24.074
You're getting promoted.

40:25.076 --> 40:26.359
Yeah.

40:27.612 --> 40:31.164
Thank you. Thank you.

40:31.165 --> 40:34.868
It was a very good idea.

40:34.869 --> 40:37.436
Thank you.

40:43.377 --> 40:45.212
Hey.

40:45.213 --> 40:46.847
What's that smell?

40:46.848 --> 40:50.767
Uh, that is the scent of victory.

40:50.768 --> 40:52.719
You know, I actually
think Dad's car accident

40:52.720 --> 40:54.554
knocked some sense into him.

40:54.555 --> 40:56.119
- Oh, yeah?
- Should we show her?

40:56.756 --> 41:00.977
Mother, behold, the
Renwal Visible V-8 Engine.

41:00.978 --> 41:02.863
Yes.

41:02.864 --> 41:04.731
Whoa.

41:04.732 --> 41:07.534
- That's, uh, visible...
- Yeah, yeah.

41:07.535 --> 41:09.546
You can see every detail
of the cycle right there.

41:09.547 --> 41:10.863
- See that?
- It's a marvel of design.

41:10.864 --> 41:12.378
You can see the firing
pattern of the pistons.

41:12.379 --> 41:13.907
Now, is that smoke part of the marvel?

41:13.908 --> 41:15.691
- I think that's just dust.
- What? No. Look.

41:15.692 --> 41:18.195
That smells like smoke and battery acid.

41:18.196 --> 41:19.880
Jace, maybe turn it off.

41:19.881 --> 41:21.047
No, okay, you do realize

41:21.048 --> 41:23.667
this took Dad more than
40 years to get working?

41:23.668 --> 41:24.997
With your help, pal.

41:24.998 --> 41:27.254
All the more reason not
to let it go up in flames

41:27.255 --> 41:28.421
and take the house with it.

41:28.422 --> 41:29.863
- Get it out of here, please.
- Okay.

41:29.864 --> 41:31.991
- Okay. Yeah.
- Fine. I'm-I'm gonna try and figure out

41:31.992 --> 41:33.310
where the smoke's coming from.

41:33.311 --> 41:36.096
Might be a cracked seal or something.

41:36.097 --> 41:38.481
"Cracked seal."

41:38.482 --> 41:40.150
Wow, bonding accomplished.

41:40.151 --> 41:41.101
What happened?

41:41.102 --> 41:43.270
I don't know.

41:43.271 --> 41:44.688
Sympathy for the crash victim?

41:44.689 --> 41:46.106
Cupcake Wars fatigue?

41:46.107 --> 41:48.210
Maybe it's the ghost of my
old man working his magic.

41:48.211 --> 41:50.493
My money's on your dad.

41:50.494 --> 41:52.829
Do you think that
they're actually buying

41:52.830 --> 41:56.032
the car-accident cover story?

41:56.033 --> 41:57.450
Maybe.

41:57.451 --> 42:00.469
Maybe they're just too scared
to consider the alternative.

42:01.956 --> 42:04.424
Any news about Ian?

42:04.425 --> 42:05.385
No sign of him.

42:05.386 --> 42:07.961
There's an FBI surveillance
team out there looking for him.

42:07.962 --> 42:10.979
Either he set me up or he's dead, so...

42:14.101 --> 42:16.068
How are you doing?

42:21.309 --> 42:24.060
Yeah?

42:24.061 --> 42:26.912
Okay, send him in.

42:31.485 --> 42:33.453
Madam Secretary.

42:33.454 --> 42:37.123
We have a mutual enemy.

42:37.124 --> 42:39.808
I want to work with you to destroy him.

42:42.490 --> 42:49.473
