WEBVTT

00:00.024 --> 00:02.379
Previously on AMC's "The Son"...

00:02.382 --> 00:03.484
Daddy?

00:03.487 --> 00:05.942
You have no idea what
you did to this family.

00:05.945 --> 00:08.454
My daddy's gonna pay for
what he did. I promise you.

00:08.456 --> 00:10.256
Prodigal son has returned.

00:10.258 --> 00:11.601
You weren't here!

00:11.604 --> 00:13.468
Eli! Apaches.

00:13.471 --> 00:15.130
- They must have known the warriors were gone.
- Yeah.

00:15.132 --> 00:17.663
He's drilling slantways to hook my oil.

00:17.665 --> 00:19.532
This act of thievery ends tonight.

00:19.534 --> 00:21.301
- Come on, boys, faster.
- More.

00:21.303 --> 00:22.835
Someone's coming!

00:22.837 --> 00:24.837
- Ulysses, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

00:24.839 --> 00:26.703
You only got one chance.

00:26.706 --> 00:27.726
Get!

00:40.387 --> 00:42.093
José. There you go, my friend.

00:42.096 --> 00:44.222
Merry Christmas to you and your family.

00:44.224 --> 00:45.557
All the best, now.

00:45.559 --> 00:47.059
What is this? Oh, Benjamin.

00:47.061 --> 00:50.062
Boy. Here you go, Benjamin, son.

00:50.064 --> 00:52.164
Best to you, now. Merry Christmas.

00:52.166 --> 00:54.899
All the best. I think that's it.

00:59.706 --> 01:02.441
Whoo!

01:02.443 --> 01:05.777
May I have your attention
for a moment, please?

01:05.779 --> 01:07.912
Thank you all for coming,

01:07.914 --> 01:11.039
and a very, very merry
Christmas to you all.

01:11.042 --> 01:14.511
We're so honored to have you here.

01:14.514 --> 01:17.381
I'm...

01:17.384 --> 01:22.521
I'm feeling especially
grateful in this moment.

01:22.524 --> 01:24.895
My boy Pete is home.

01:26.733 --> 01:28.796
I missed him every day,

01:28.799 --> 01:31.466
despite knowing how
bravely he was fighting

01:31.469 --> 01:33.976
those bastards who sought us harm.

01:35.982 --> 01:39.116
How dark those times
must have been for him...

01:39.119 --> 01:42.787
To be so far from his
family who loves him.

01:42.790 --> 01:44.703
Give applause for my son...

01:44.706 --> 01:47.641
...a true Texas hero.

01:47.644 --> 01:49.886
- Hear, hear!
- Yeah.

01:52.157 --> 01:54.424
Come on, now! Let's go!

02:02.234 --> 02:05.265
There are three warlords
and God knows how much chaos

02:05.268 --> 02:07.730
between here and Tampico.

02:07.733 --> 02:11.007
Now, once we get you down
there, it's gonna be better.

02:11.009 --> 02:14.144
You'll be with your... your family.

02:14.146 --> 02:18.147
They're second cousins.
They've never met me.

02:18.149 --> 02:20.023
If you have a better idea...

02:20.026 --> 02:21.526
I don't.

02:21.529 --> 02:24.196
We need the money to travel.

02:26.436 --> 02:27.935
For food.

02:30.074 --> 02:32.342
You keep saying "we."

02:38.619 --> 02:40.770
What are you doing?

02:45.376 --> 02:47.218
I'm not going back.

02:47.221 --> 02:50.021
I've decided.

02:50.024 --> 02:55.294
Do you really think we're
gonna take a train somewhere?

02:55.297 --> 02:57.798
And what?

02:57.801 --> 03:00.301
Get married? Have children?

03:00.304 --> 03:02.872
That ain't what I'm saying.

03:02.875 --> 03:06.476
Then what?

03:06.479 --> 03:08.379
Do you want to be forgiven?

03:10.485 --> 03:13.419
No.

03:13.422 --> 03:17.224
I don't care about you.

03:17.227 --> 03:20.361
I don't need your ring.

03:20.364 --> 03:25.054
The only thing I needed from
you was to stop your father.

03:25.057 --> 03:26.648
And you couldn't.

03:28.184 --> 03:30.518
- My family was counting on you.
- Shh!

03:30.520 --> 03:32.386
- Shh, shh!
- And you couldn't.

03:32.388 --> 03:34.722
It's a war zone. You're
drawing attention.

03:34.724 --> 03:36.546
Okay. Shh, shh.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.750
Hold it together.

03:38.753 --> 03:41.087
We'll get through this.

03:44.394 --> 03:46.027
It's okay.

03:48.867 --> 03:50.566
You ruined my life.

03:59.103 --> 04:01.523

04:02.784 --> 04:05.132

04:05.703 --> 04:09.054

04:11.376 --> 04:13.211

04:13.753 --> 04:16.218

04:21.101 --> 04:22.602
Sí.

04:29.355 --> 04:32.171

04:33.324 --> 04:34.689
El gringo?

04:36.095 --> 04:39.125

04:40.071 --> 04:42.695

04:42.765 --> 04:44.664
_

05:01.882 --> 05:03.374
_

05:05.313 --> 05:06.960
- Maria?
- A moment, mister.

05:06.963 --> 05:08.378
_

05:08.381 --> 05:10.335
Where you going? Hey, Maria.

05:10.345 --> 05:11.967
_

05:12.289 --> 05:14.265
_

05:14.268 --> 05:15.735
Maria!

05:15.738 --> 05:18.005
Maria, tell them we're together! Maria!

05:18.008 --> 05:19.273
Come back!

05:23.282 --> 05:26.250
Maria!

05:26.253 --> 05:28.186
Maria, come back!

05:28.189 --> 05:29.823
Come back!

05:29.826 --> 05:32.000
We're together! Maria!

05:32.003 --> 05:34.436
We're together! Maria! Maria!

06:19.225 --> 06:21.816
Bourbon, neat.

06:21.819 --> 06:23.331
Yes, sir, Colonel.

06:23.333 --> 06:24.699
Yeah.

06:24.701 --> 06:26.201
Merry Christmas, Niles.

06:26.203 --> 06:30.037
Merry, Christmas, sir.

06:30.039 --> 06:32.639
And a little extra for the New Year.

06:32.641 --> 06:34.621
Oh, I think so, I think so.

06:34.624 --> 06:37.860
Good health.

06:37.863 --> 06:39.745
Oh, God, that's good.

06:39.748 --> 06:41.648
Mm.

06:41.650 --> 06:43.717
Excuse me, sir.

06:43.719 --> 06:46.520
Eugene Monahan. My
friends call me Buddy.

06:46.522 --> 06:48.581
Well, merry Christmas, Mr. Monahan.

06:48.584 --> 06:51.858
And to you. Colonel, I'm an admirer.

06:51.860 --> 06:55.396
But it does not appear that
you need any more admirers.

06:55.398 --> 06:57.831
What you need are investors.

06:57.833 --> 06:59.266
You must be Phineas.

06:59.268 --> 07:01.901
This is Mr. Monahan.
Buddy to his friends.

07:01.903 --> 07:03.058
Nice meetin' you.

07:03.061 --> 07:04.904
Nice to meet you, too. There you are.

07:04.906 --> 07:06.347
Gentlemen, congratulations

07:06.350 --> 07:08.741
on snatchin' up those
neighboring leases.

07:08.743 --> 07:10.876
That's 13 of 'em, right?

07:10.878 --> 07:13.179
Whew! A hell of a perimeter now.

07:13.181 --> 07:15.548
- Circle those wagons.
- Mm.

07:15.550 --> 07:17.016
For a stranger,

07:17.018 --> 07:19.619
you're quite well-informed
of the local goings-on.

07:19.621 --> 07:21.588
Now, see, I don't believe
that a fellow Texan

07:21.590 --> 07:23.123
is ever a stranger.

07:23.125 --> 07:26.692
Mm, "South Texas Improvement Company."

07:26.694 --> 07:29.360
Tell me, Mr. Monahan, what
is it about South Texas

07:29.363 --> 07:31.030
you feel needs improving?

07:31.032 --> 07:34.234
We're interested in investing
in your burgeoning enterprise.

07:34.236 --> 07:36.613
Gentlemen, I'm here to
propose a partnership.

07:36.616 --> 07:38.583
Mm, it's Christmas, sir.

07:38.586 --> 07:40.652
We don't talk about
business on this day.

07:40.655 --> 07:42.908
My apologies, Colonel. Quite right.

07:42.910 --> 07:45.761
It's just that I surmised
time was running out

07:45.764 --> 07:47.612
for your going it alone.

07:47.615 --> 07:51.216
This drilling and pumping, it's...

07:51.218 --> 07:52.652
It's not for the faint of heart.

07:53.741 --> 07:55.222
It's gonna take a mountain of cash

07:55.225 --> 07:57.388
to get those leases producing.

07:57.391 --> 08:00.394
And, frankly, it's resources
I'm certain you lack.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.794
Your certainty means very little to me.

08:02.797 --> 08:05.497
We didn't even touch on the
distribution challenges yet.

08:05.499 --> 08:07.800
Rail service out here is abysmal.

08:07.802 --> 08:11.736
Colonel, you could be
swimming in an ocean of crude,

08:11.738 --> 08:13.272
but it ain't worth a mosquito's fart,

08:13.274 --> 08:14.506
you can't ship it to market.

08:14.508 --> 08:15.740
Am I right?

08:15.742 --> 08:17.347
Where you from?

08:17.350 --> 08:18.682
Well, I'm from Lubbock.

08:18.685 --> 08:20.252
Do you mean to say you've never heard

08:20.255 --> 08:21.845
of the Monahan family up there?

08:21.848 --> 08:23.182
I have not.

08:23.184 --> 08:24.849
Well, I'm not surprised.

08:24.851 --> 08:26.918
You might have heard of
my mother's family, though.

08:26.920 --> 08:28.253
The Youngbloods?

08:28.255 --> 08:30.542
- Mm.
- Choctaw going all the way back.

08:30.545 --> 08:34.692
In the summer months, I exhibit
some of the darker complexion.

08:34.695 --> 08:37.095
Tell me about these investors.

08:37.097 --> 08:40.030
Well, they're good men,
men I can vouch for.

08:40.033 --> 08:43.433
Any of these good men from
north of the Mason Dixon?

08:43.436 --> 08:45.503
Some of 'em.

08:45.505 --> 08:48.038
Yeah, that's what I thought.

08:48.040 --> 08:51.230
Merry Christmas, sir.
Thanks for dropping in.

08:51.233 --> 08:53.033
I suppose a tour of the property's

08:53.036 --> 08:55.403
out of the question, then?

08:55.406 --> 08:58.515
See, I've heard that
García tract's just

08:58.518 --> 09:02.353
it's picturesque this time of year.

09:02.355 --> 09:05.856
And what a bargain you got on that.

09:05.858 --> 09:08.359
Gentlemen.

09:08.361 --> 09:10.394
Fellas, excuse me. Pardon me.

09:10.396 --> 09:12.496
Ask around about this one.

09:12.498 --> 09:14.863
I want to know who he's riding with.

09:14.866 --> 09:15.998
Okay.

09:16.001 --> 09:19.169
The jackals are gathering.

09:19.171 --> 09:22.840
Pleased to see the Colonel's
added some color to his ranks.

09:22.842 --> 09:24.374
Those fellas work real hard.

09:24.376 --> 09:26.910
Harder than those greasers.

09:26.912 --> 09:28.472
Hell, I don't need to tell you

09:28.475 --> 09:30.847
after your recent sojourn down there.

09:30.850 --> 09:33.016
I ain't got nothing against Mexicans.

09:33.018 --> 09:35.085
Tejanos, neither. Lotta good men.

09:35.087 --> 09:37.420
Their loyalty will always
be to their own kind.

09:37.422 --> 09:39.556
- We ain't no different.
- Oh.

09:39.558 --> 09:42.025
My loyalty's to the Lone Star.

09:42.027 --> 09:45.528
Daddy? Colonel's askin' after you.

09:45.530 --> 09:47.231
Good meetin' you, Sheriff Dart.

09:47.233 --> 09:50.567
To members of your family,
it's just plain Moses.

09:50.569 --> 09:52.869
I appreciate that, Moses.

10:06.918 --> 10:09.085
You wanted to see me?

10:09.087 --> 10:12.688
Percy Midkiff has seen the light.

10:12.690 --> 10:14.190
Oh, yeah.

10:14.192 --> 10:17.593
After encountering a few
mishaps with his drills,

10:17.595 --> 10:20.062
he decided to accept our offer.

10:20.064 --> 10:23.766
We'll give him an eighth,
same as everyone else.

10:23.768 --> 10:26.468
I don't hold grudges.

10:26.470 --> 10:29.571
You planning on sabotaging
every well in South Texas?

10:29.573 --> 10:32.441
Yeah, I doubt that'll be necessary.

10:35.646 --> 10:38.547
Next week, I want you
to meet this Cherokee

10:38.549 --> 10:40.816
who's been helping educate me.

10:40.818 --> 10:43.058
He taught himself about the oil trade

10:43.061 --> 10:46.654
after his tribe were
chiseled out of their leases.

10:46.657 --> 10:49.066
Geology, chemistry, that sort of thing.

10:49.069 --> 10:51.270
I think I'd rather focus on the ranch.

10:51.273 --> 10:53.980
Seems you and Phineas have
the oil side of things covered.

10:53.983 --> 10:55.983
Ranchers like dealing with a fella

10:55.986 --> 10:58.920
who's got dirt under his
nails and shit on his boots.

10:58.923 --> 11:02.191
Hell, you're a hero now, right?

11:08.511 --> 11:12.012
What do you want from me?

11:12.014 --> 11:15.483
I want you to run this with me.

11:15.485 --> 11:17.218
The oil side of things.

11:17.220 --> 11:19.527
That makes no sense. Phineas
was born for this work.

11:19.530 --> 11:20.886
Oh, don't worry about Phineas.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.417
He's gonna be a governor one day.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.691
He's a politician through and through.

11:24.694 --> 11:26.925
You're not.

11:26.928 --> 11:30.531
You're a leader... Like me.

11:33.204 --> 11:37.104
This family is going in
a new kind of direction.

11:37.107 --> 11:39.847
And we both know it's not cows.

11:39.850 --> 11:42.718
I want you and I to build something

11:42.721 --> 11:45.889
that will be lasting for your children.

11:45.892 --> 11:50.761
I'm sorry. But my answer is no.

11:50.764 --> 11:55.446
Pete, you made me a promise.

11:55.449 --> 11:56.982
The way we got that land...

11:56.985 --> 12:01.655
In the end, it will
all have been worth it.

12:12.239 --> 12:14.339
Hey, bug.

12:14.341 --> 12:15.908
Grandaddy was lying.

12:15.910 --> 12:17.558
Were you eavesdropping?

12:17.561 --> 12:20.192
Outside, when he gave that big speech.

12:20.195 --> 12:22.463
You didn't hunt no bandits in Mexico.

12:24.919 --> 12:27.620
Am I wrong?

12:27.622 --> 12:31.123
People make up stories
they want to hear.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.426
They fill in the blanks.

12:33.428 --> 12:35.561
So what did happen?

12:37.732 --> 12:40.299
Why did you leave us?

12:40.301 --> 12:42.234
I was trying to help someone.

12:42.236 --> 12:44.869
Someone who would have
gotten killed otherwise.

12:45.715 --> 12:47.314
Maria García?

12:47.317 --> 12:48.573
Mm-hmm.

12:52.079 --> 12:54.479
She's a good person.

12:54.481 --> 12:56.248
I agree.

13:02.789 --> 13:05.490
Were you planning on coming back?

13:05.492 --> 13:06.959
From Mexico?

13:06.961 --> 13:09.094
'Course I was.

13:09.096 --> 13:10.605
So what's the problem then?

13:10.608 --> 13:11.774
With what?

13:11.777 --> 13:14.631
You and Momma.

13:14.634 --> 13:16.767
We're fine.

13:27.473 --> 13:30.092
Don't you know a lady
should never drink alone?

13:32.897 --> 13:35.463
Colonel says you haven't
spoken to him all week.

13:35.465 --> 13:37.432
Well, bless his heart.

13:37.434 --> 13:41.302
I sure hope his feelings
aren't hurt too bad.

13:41.304 --> 13:43.705
Well, at least you're
not mad at me anymore.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.042
Who says I'm not?

13:53.817 --> 13:56.918
I don't think I'm
gonna get through this.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.953
Having to smile and make nice

13:58.955 --> 14:01.255
like things are perfectly normal.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.224
It's just once a year.

14:03.226 --> 14:06.327
Ah, it's gonna be every day.

14:06.329 --> 14:10.098
This will get easier. For everyone.

14:12.968 --> 14:15.502
The Colonel tell you to say that?

14:25.814 --> 14:28.682
You need a match?

14:28.684 --> 14:30.351
Can I have a cigarette?

14:30.353 --> 14:32.986
No, ma'am.

14:32.988 --> 14:36.657
Too bad my granddaddy's
making you work on Christmas.

14:36.659 --> 14:41.161
Well, heck, I don't consider this work.

14:41.163 --> 14:43.308
Don't you want to be
with your own family?

14:43.311 --> 14:45.165
Well...

14:48.003 --> 14:51.471
...my brother lives up
in Shreveport, but...

14:54.509 --> 14:57.811
That's too far.

14:57.813 --> 15:00.680
And my wife...

15:00.682 --> 15:03.683
she died some years ago.

15:03.685 --> 15:07.053
On Christmas Eve, actually.

15:07.055 --> 15:10.723
And the son that she birthed, Curtis,

15:10.725 --> 15:13.293
he succumbed 11 days later.

15:13.295 --> 15:15.028
I'm sorry, Mr. Gilbert.

15:15.030 --> 15:17.130
Oh, thank you.

15:17.132 --> 15:22.001
I like being out and
about this time of year.

15:22.003 --> 15:25.337
Keeps the mind occupied.

15:25.339 --> 15:29.141
And the Colonel inviting
me to this event,

15:29.143 --> 15:31.710
it just means the world to me.

15:31.712 --> 15:35.414
You got a solid family behind you.

15:35.416 --> 15:37.416
You are blessed.

15:39.753 --> 15:44.089
I'm glad my daddy's home from Mexico.

15:44.091 --> 15:45.757
Thanks for bringing him back.

15:45.759 --> 15:50.062
I was just one man among many.

15:50.064 --> 15:54.313
I-I bet he was real excited
he was gonna see Momma.

15:54.316 --> 15:56.049
Oh, yeah.

15:57.603 --> 16:01.672
Did he talk about her a lot?

16:01.674 --> 16:06.677
Well, he was mostly
quiet on the ride home.

16:06.679 --> 16:11.115
But he had just done four
months on a Mexican chain-gang.

16:13.053 --> 16:18.589
I imagine that would change your
outlook on a number of things.

16:18.591 --> 16:20.624
Like being married.

16:20.626 --> 16:24.462
Well, now, I couldn't speculate on that.

16:26.566 --> 16:29.567
Sometimes...

16:29.569 --> 16:32.703
...people just need time...

16:32.705 --> 16:34.438
to readjust.

16:36.642 --> 16:38.075
Jeannie?

16:38.077 --> 16:39.688
I've been looking for you.

16:39.691 --> 16:41.390
Could you come over here, please?

16:50.923 --> 16:53.457
I don't want you talking to that man.

16:53.459 --> 16:57.962
He was just telling me
about his dead wife and baby.

16:57.965 --> 16:59.464
That is sad,

16:59.467 --> 17:02.099
but it doesn't make him
any less of a bad influence.

17:02.101 --> 17:04.308
He's a violent man.

17:04.310 --> 17:06.469
I don't want you near him.

17:06.471 --> 17:08.319
He was polite.

17:08.321 --> 17:09.622
So is the devil.

17:09.625 --> 17:10.907
Everything all right?

17:10.910 --> 17:14.144
Yes. It's handled.

17:16.815 --> 17:20.617
Niles was talking to her, alone.

17:20.618 --> 17:23.353
He sure as hell wormed his
way in deep while I was gone.

17:23.355 --> 17:26.089
I don't know why he has
to be around here so much.

17:26.090 --> 17:28.291
We both know what he's capable of.

18:01.858 --> 18:03.123
_

18:04.563 --> 18:06.362
I'm glad you're alive.

18:06.364 --> 18:07.730
You hurt?

18:12.103 --> 18:14.370
Do you know what I miss?

18:17.208 --> 18:18.841
Lebkuchen.

18:21.012 --> 18:23.912
My father took me to the
Christmas market in Bremen

18:23.914 --> 18:25.348
before we left.

18:27.285 --> 18:32.254
It was so cold that
night, but I didn't care.

18:34.458 --> 18:37.225
What a sight.

18:37.228 --> 18:39.561
All lit with torches.

18:39.563 --> 18:43.199
A children's choir singing.

18:44.568 --> 18:47.702
But the Lebkuchen was a gift from God.

18:47.704 --> 18:50.038
You like gingerbread?

18:50.040 --> 18:51.939
You kill that Apache?

18:56.213 --> 18:59.547
He had two arrows in him already.

18:59.549 --> 19:02.283
But he couldn't just die from that.

19:02.285 --> 19:04.894
No, he had to stumble about like a drunk

19:04.897 --> 19:06.554
and find my hiding place.

19:06.556 --> 19:07.822
Did you see others?

19:07.824 --> 19:09.157
Did you see where they went?

19:09.159 --> 19:11.292
No.

19:11.294 --> 19:13.661
I remember the screaming.

19:21.960 --> 19:25.161
There's not enough of
us to survive on our own.

19:27.201 --> 19:30.810
We need to find another
band of Comanche.

19:30.812 --> 19:32.012
Who's nearby?

19:33.631 --> 19:36.178
_

19:38.254 --> 19:40.787
You need to heal before we move camp.

19:40.789 --> 19:43.424
Apaches know we're here.

19:43.426 --> 19:46.326
They know we're weak.

19:46.328 --> 19:48.195
Winter's in the air.

19:49.831 --> 19:51.831
We need to move soon.

19:51.833 --> 19:55.001
You could die on a long trip.

19:55.003 --> 19:58.804
I could die tonight in my sleep.

19:58.806 --> 20:02.141
Our people would be fine either way.

20:11.453 --> 20:13.652
You're ready to lead.

20:31.205 --> 20:32.837
You hungry?

20:33.920 --> 20:35.306
_

20:35.309 --> 20:36.575
If you want.

20:40.481 --> 20:42.880
Feeling more yourself?

20:47.053 --> 20:50.355
The Apache I killed today...

20:50.357 --> 20:52.224
You had to.

20:52.226 --> 20:54.759
I know.

20:54.761 --> 20:57.162
But I forgot to take his scalp.

20:59.766 --> 21:02.834
It should be mine. I earned it.

21:42.329 --> 21:44.762
Knock it off, you two.

21:48.868 --> 21:51.035
Ow! Ow! Shit.

21:56.676 --> 22:00.444
No, Maudie, you've had your dinner.

22:05.885 --> 22:07.218
Daisy.

22:09.589 --> 22:10.955
Oh, Daisy.

22:10.957 --> 22:12.790
How you doing, girl?

22:14.427 --> 22:16.060
Oh.

22:18.865 --> 22:21.264
Oh.

22:21.266 --> 22:24.367
No.

22:24.369 --> 22:30.640
Ohh. Ohh. Oh, no.

22:51.096 --> 22:52.462
Ms. McCullough?

22:54.633 --> 22:56.165
Ms. McCullough?

22:56.167 --> 22:58.735
In here.

22:58.737 --> 23:00.803
You call for a hand?

23:02.741 --> 23:04.974
Oh.

23:20.958 --> 23:23.626
Sh... She was old.

23:41.378 --> 23:43.779
Would you like to say anything?

23:43.781 --> 23:45.980
No.

24:03.367 --> 24:05.867
Hmm.

24:12.876 --> 24:14.909
Is that all, ma'am?

24:16.379 --> 24:18.546
I don't want to be alone.

24:18.549 --> 24:20.349
Pour one for yourself.

24:25.021 --> 24:27.655
You legal, Ulises?

24:30.693 --> 24:32.660
No, ma'am.

24:32.662 --> 24:34.896
Don't matter to me.

24:34.898 --> 24:36.931
INS steers clear of here.

24:36.933 --> 24:38.932
I see to that.

24:38.934 --> 24:41.902
I hire who I want.

24:41.904 --> 24:43.937
Thank you.

24:51.968 --> 24:55.882
This is, uh, a beautiful, old house.

24:55.885 --> 24:58.952
My granddaddy built it.

24:58.954 --> 25:00.420
Colonel McCullough?

25:00.422 --> 25:01.889
You've heard of him?

25:01.891 --> 25:03.490
Oh, yeah.

25:03.492 --> 25:04.926
I read about him.

25:04.929 --> 25:08.761
Uh, he was, uh, a captive
and a Texas Ranger,

25:08.764 --> 25:10.998
and he protected that girl.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.967
I love those stories.

25:13.969 --> 25:16.403
I just really like history.

25:16.405 --> 25:17.604
Uh...

25:19.908 --> 25:22.341
I want you to hear something.

25:41.195 --> 25:42.995
Now, Carter Murphy,

25:42.997 --> 25:46.163
he had been a scalp
hunter extraordinaire.

25:46.166 --> 25:49.802
He was most famous for inviting
a group of Apaches to dinner,

25:49.804 --> 25:51.913
then slipping out
halfway through the meal

25:51.916 --> 25:55.340
to touch off a cannon
charged with canister

25:55.342 --> 25:57.175
hidden behind a curtain.

25:57.177 --> 26:00.345
The shot obliterated
the unsuspecting Indians

26:00.347 --> 26:03.849
and destroyed everything
else in his living room.

26:03.851 --> 26:06.241
No one stole his horses after that.

26:06.244 --> 26:09.905
That doesn't bother you?

26:09.908 --> 26:11.457
Jeanne Anne, maybe just another
splash of bourbon in here?

26:11.459 --> 26:13.725
- Uh, not really.
- Yes, sir.

26:13.727 --> 26:16.294
I mean, this is a good story, you know?

26:16.296 --> 26:19.297
Oh, you calling my granddaddy a liar?

26:19.299 --> 26:23.034
No, ma'am. Just a Texan.

26:23.036 --> 26:25.703
This land is built on tall tales.

26:33.415 --> 26:35.682
You can leave now.

26:51.276 --> 26:55.002
_

26:55.509 --> 26:56.650
_

26:57.017 --> 27:00.408
_

27:00.535 --> 27:02.095
_

27:02.454 --> 27:03.900
_

27:04.289 --> 27:05.874
_

27:06.124 --> 27:08.209
_

27:08.210 --> 27:09.611
_

27:09.614 --> 27:10.545
Mm.

27:10.548 --> 27:12.361
_

27:12.743 --> 27:13.869
_

27:13.924 --> 27:15.416
_

27:16.527 --> 27:17.654
_

27:18.011 --> 27:19.431
_

27:19.642 --> 27:21.173
_

27:21.681 --> 27:23.322
_

27:23.325 --> 27:26.197
_

27:27.771 --> 27:30.314
_

27:30.315 --> 27:32.720
_

27:32.723 --> 27:33.819
_

27:35.445 --> 27:36.572
_

27:36.575 --> 27:39.041
_

27:39.658 --> 27:41.330
_

27:41.743 --> 27:43.884
_

27:44.788 --> 27:47.081
_

27:47.082 --> 27:48.181
_

27:49.042 --> 27:50.220
_

27:50.919 --> 27:53.541
_

27:54.881 --> 27:56.759
_

27:58.783 --> 28:00.462
_

28:02.681 --> 28:05.600
_

28:08.440 --> 28:10.440
Hey, brother.

28:13.311 --> 28:17.080
It's special, so I wanted it to be last.

28:17.082 --> 28:18.981
- Wow.
- Open it.

28:21.186 --> 28:23.619
Been saving it for the right time.

28:26.591 --> 28:27.923
That's a handsome gun.

28:27.925 --> 28:29.024
It's engraved.

28:32.330 --> 28:33.496
Thank you.

28:33.498 --> 28:35.465
The old man got you down?

28:37.969 --> 28:40.928
Finn do you know about his plans

28:40.931 --> 28:42.370
for the oil business?

28:42.372 --> 28:43.681
Long term?

28:43.684 --> 28:45.840
Who do you think comes
up with those plans,

28:45.842 --> 28:47.976
writes 'em down and makes 'em happen?

28:47.978 --> 28:49.344
So you know.

28:49.346 --> 28:50.778
About?

28:50.780 --> 28:54.682
Him wanting me to take over. Eventually.

28:54.684 --> 28:56.951
Of course.

28:59.173 --> 29:01.490
Governor, though.
That's really something.

29:01.492 --> 29:04.159
Mm-hmm.

29:04.161 --> 29:08.029
Well, that's a long ways off to be sure.

29:08.031 --> 29:10.398
I wonder if you'll still
talk to us little people.

29:13.136 --> 29:14.392
I'll see... see to it

29:14.395 --> 29:17.029
you have a desk in
the Governor's Mansion,

29:17.032 --> 29:20.473
just like mine, but slightly smaller.

29:21.677 --> 29:23.142
Excuse me.

29:43.433 --> 29:45.700
People seemed to enjoy themselves.

29:49.606 --> 29:51.872
You want one?

29:51.874 --> 29:54.875
No, I'm good.

29:54.877 --> 29:57.312
Suit yourself.

29:57.314 --> 29:59.447
How long is it gonna take, Sal?

30:01.184 --> 30:03.218
For what?

30:03.220 --> 30:06.521
You to consider forgiving
me just a little bit.

30:08.658 --> 30:11.058
Years.

30:11.060 --> 30:12.659
Maybe.

30:12.661 --> 30:16.030
I mean, maybe it takes forever.

30:16.032 --> 30:18.465
Maybe I just keep you standing there,

30:18.467 --> 30:21.802
waiting, not knowing.

30:25.407 --> 30:26.858
Damn it!

30:28.310 --> 30:30.577
- C'mon.
- Is it bleeding bad?

30:30.579 --> 30:32.579
Let me see.

30:32.581 --> 30:35.149
Not too bad. Not too bad.

30:37.086 --> 30:39.053
It's gonna be all right.

30:40.556 --> 30:43.523
I see you don't wear your ring.

30:43.525 --> 30:46.693
Yeah, they took it in jail.

30:46.695 --> 30:48.228
I need to get a new one.

30:52.501 --> 30:54.668
I'll wait.

30:54.670 --> 30:56.336
However long.

31:02.444 --> 31:06.212
Was I really that bad?

31:06.214 --> 31:09.616
Oh, Sal.

31:09.618 --> 31:12.185
There isn't a bad thing about you.

31:18.927 --> 31:21.360
I guess he told you.

31:21.362 --> 31:22.710
You knew he would.

31:22.713 --> 31:25.468
Oh, I've got great things
in store for you, my son.

31:25.471 --> 31:26.913
But not the family business.

31:26.916 --> 31:28.866
Oh, you can be part of
this as much as anyone.

31:28.869 --> 31:31.537
Ah. Just not the face to the public.

31:31.539 --> 31:34.407
You belong in Austin.
Where the real power is.

31:34.409 --> 31:35.941
And one of these days, you'll be sitting

31:35.943 --> 31:37.880
- in the Governor's mansion...
- Governor's mansion.

31:37.882 --> 31:39.578
Yeah. Right.

31:39.580 --> 31:41.213
That's a pipe dream, and you know it.

31:41.215 --> 31:44.383
Oh, we can get that done. Believe me.

31:46.721 --> 31:49.988
You couldn't even tell
me this to my face.

31:49.990 --> 31:52.758
- Is it because...
- Of course not.

31:52.760 --> 31:54.259
You want to batch up with a friend,

31:54.261 --> 31:56.227
that's your business,

31:56.229 --> 31:57.762
as long as you're discreet.

31:57.764 --> 32:00.398
Then why?

32:02.101 --> 32:07.405
As much as it drives me
crazy, Pete sticks to his guns.

32:07.407 --> 32:10.908
You're a good son.

32:10.910 --> 32:13.345
You do what you're told.

32:13.347 --> 32:17.382
But in this business, you
got to be your own man.

32:17.384 --> 32:20.885
You're holding my loyalty against me?

32:20.887 --> 32:23.521
Your strengths lie elsewhere.

32:23.523 --> 32:25.457
What about what I want?

32:25.459 --> 32:26.958
Oh.

32:26.960 --> 32:29.360
Everyone's got their part to play.

32:41.374 --> 32:43.769
- Hey, Finn. You leaving?
- Yeah.

32:43.772 --> 32:45.376
The old man is sending me to Austin.

32:45.378 --> 32:47.066
- Let me walk you out.
- Nah, I'm fine.

32:47.069 --> 32:48.912
Hey, Finn.

32:48.914 --> 32:51.382
I know you're not okay
with his plan for us.

32:51.384 --> 32:53.216
It's you who should be runnin' it.

32:53.218 --> 32:55.419
Damn right it should be.

32:57.356 --> 32:59.556
I gotta hand it to you, brother.

32:59.558 --> 33:01.992
I don't know what you do,

33:01.994 --> 33:05.661
but you cast a real spell
over that old son of a bitch.

33:25.784 --> 33:27.884
I'm tired of being chased.

33:32.123 --> 33:34.757
Maybe it doesn't have to be like this.

33:37.280 --> 33:42.530
_

33:42.533 --> 33:44.533
They still fight by their side.

33:46.427 --> 33:48.102
_

33:48.105 --> 33:49.575
Their mean women.

33:51.112 --> 33:53.057
_

33:53.060 --> 33:55.277
It could work.

33:55.279 --> 33:57.779
What are you talking about?

33:59.650 --> 34:03.718
Comanches should join
together as one band

34:03.720 --> 34:06.388
and kill all the whites.

34:06.390 --> 34:09.291
There are thousands
and thousands of whites.

34:10.893 --> 34:12.793
Why do they keep coming after us?

34:12.795 --> 34:15.897
'Cause they want the land.

34:15.899 --> 34:18.333
They'll have to kill
all of us to get it.

34:18.335 --> 34:20.835
But I think we can kill them first.

34:20.837 --> 34:22.670
We can't.

34:24.639 --> 34:30.978
Well, if we can't beat all the whites,

34:30.981 --> 34:33.181
maybe we could live with them.

34:33.183 --> 34:34.482
You and me?

34:35.818 --> 34:38.453
What? I could wear a dress.

34:38.455 --> 34:39.853
You'd look like a pea hen.

34:39.856 --> 34:41.130
You looked like a baby deer...

34:41.132 --> 34:43.456
_

34:46.161 --> 34:48.795
I could steal a dress,

34:48.797 --> 34:51.797
and you could take me
to visit the white world.

34:51.800 --> 34:54.101
I speak the language.

34:54.103 --> 34:56.268
Though maybe I won't say nothing.

34:56.271 --> 35:01.841
I'll just let you walk me
around the village by your side.

35:01.843 --> 35:04.544
I want to see people's faces.

35:06.815 --> 35:09.516
Why are you talkin' about the
white world all of a sudden?

35:12.888 --> 35:17.957
Hey. I'm happy here.

35:17.959 --> 35:19.192
With you.

35:26.201 --> 35:28.200
Good.

35:31.339 --> 35:34.140
That's what I wanted you to say.

35:35.176 --> 35:37.644
'Cause we're having a baby.

35:37.646 --> 35:40.547
What?

35:40.549 --> 35:42.481
When?

35:42.483 --> 35:43.983
In the spring.

35:45.420 --> 35:47.353
I'm gonna be a father?

35:51.359 --> 35:52.926
You better get ready.

35:52.928 --> 35:54.575
I'm ready to make another one right now.

35:55.814 --> 35:57.229
Sleep...

35:59.991 --> 36:01.147
_

36:07.240 --> 36:08.955
Well, shit.

36:24.960 --> 36:27.861
You thought about meeting
my Cherokee next week?

36:29.665 --> 36:31.431
- Maybe.
- Mm.

36:31.433 --> 36:35.669
You willing to take a
step in my direction first?

36:36.939 --> 36:38.672
Hmm.

36:38.674 --> 36:40.507
What do you have in mind?

36:46.148 --> 36:47.781
We are closed!

36:49.952 --> 36:52.029
I said we are closed!

36:53.621 --> 36:56.022
Oh. Colonel.

36:56.025 --> 36:58.625
I had no idea it was you.

36:58.627 --> 36:59.959
- Mm.
- Come on in.

36:59.961 --> 37:02.328
Apologies for my late arrival.

37:02.330 --> 37:05.398
For you, the door is always open.

37:10.505 --> 37:13.506
I appreciate you greatly as an employee,

37:13.508 --> 37:18.978
but more important than that,
as a good and true friend.

37:21.183 --> 37:23.883
Warms my heart, Colonel.

37:23.885 --> 37:25.851
It's been quite a Christmas.

37:25.853 --> 37:28.254
Yeah, that it has.

37:28.256 --> 37:31.891
I appreciate everything
you've done for my family.

37:31.893 --> 37:34.151
You've labored hard and well.

37:34.154 --> 37:37.028
Oh, I come from working stock.

37:37.030 --> 37:38.497
Idle and hands and all.

37:38.499 --> 37:41.971
You know, I've been thinking...

37:44.037 --> 37:46.738
...you should take some time off.

37:46.740 --> 37:49.374
Time off.

37:49.376 --> 37:51.943
Hell, I wouldn't even
know what to do with that.

37:51.945 --> 37:54.513
Oh, but you could travel to Georgia,

37:54.515 --> 37:57.416
see that little lady you've
been corresponding with.

37:57.418 --> 37:59.017
I'll cover your travel.

38:00.387 --> 38:05.090
I must confess, sir, I'm confused.

38:05.092 --> 38:06.891
Well, I'll keep paying you, of course,

38:06.893 --> 38:12.129
and you can consider the
loan on this bar forgiven.

38:12.131 --> 38:13.297
It's yours...

38:13.299 --> 38:16.367
outright.

38:19.972 --> 38:22.373
You're trying to get rid of me.

38:22.375 --> 38:26.043
Oh, it's not forever.

38:26.045 --> 38:31.048
Down the line when
things cool off a bit,

38:31.050 --> 38:34.151
you'll be back in the
thick of it with us.

38:34.153 --> 38:38.389
Colonel, I'm loyal.

38:40.793 --> 38:43.794
I've stood by your side.

38:43.796 --> 38:47.664
And I've sullied my hands
on many a misadventure

38:47.666 --> 38:51.468
so that you would not
have to tarnish your own.

38:51.470 --> 38:55.171
I value your loyalty greatly.

38:55.173 --> 39:00.277
Well, then let me be blunt.

39:00.279 --> 39:02.679
You need me now.

39:02.681 --> 39:06.264
You don't want to cut me
loose with enemies at the gate.

39:08.487 --> 39:11.621
The decision's been made.

39:11.623 --> 39:14.857
I see the origins of it now.

39:17.362 --> 39:20.997
You're gonna roll over
and take Pete's side.

39:20.999 --> 39:24.700
You mean my son's side.

39:33.511 --> 39:36.979
I appreciate your understanding.

39:43.721 --> 39:50.559
July 3rd, 1863,

39:50.561 --> 39:55.264
against the advice of
Lieutenant-General Longstreet,

39:55.266 --> 39:58.534
General Lee charged his men

39:58.536 --> 40:01.704
across the open fields of Gettysburg...

40:04.274 --> 40:09.277
...sealing the tragic
fate of the Confederacy.

40:09.279 --> 40:15.283
Now, why didn't he just move
around the Federal right flank

40:15.285 --> 40:19.688
and force them Yankee
dogs out of position?

40:21.058 --> 40:24.893
I guess we will never know.

40:27.698 --> 40:31.433
Even the greatest generals
are not immune to error.

40:35.872 --> 40:38.806
You really do need a break.
