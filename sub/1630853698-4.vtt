that I don't like,

04:10.815 --> 04:12.252

and she got pissed.

04:12.382 --> 04:13.862

just piss that away

04:26.091 --> 04:27.223

Yeah, I did. I tried.
I don't know.

maybe I should talk to her,

That's why, Stacey.

for you, and I don't like

living down here all alone.

an old friend you lose

- Okay.

05:26.108 --> 05:28.153
- Okay. I just got the phone
with Jules,

05:28.284 --> 05:29.894
who just got off the phone
with Maria Hernandez,

05:30.025 --> 05:31.766
who just got off the phone
with Lisa Bishop,

is the A&R lady

- Yes, yes, yes, I remember.
- Okay, okay,

love the backstory.
What did she say?

05:37.641 --> 05:41.819
- Okay. Well, first off, Maria
wants us back at the club

from now, the 11:00 p.m. slot.

- It's fucking huge.
- It's fucking huge.

05:49.087 --> 05:53.135
- Oh, Saturday night.
Saturday fucking night.

05:53.265 --> 05:54.745
- But, there's more.

05:54.876 --> 05:58.358
Apparently,
Lisa called her about us.

05:58.488 --> 06:01.012
Yeah. 'Cause she's gonna be
in town from LA that weekend,

06:01.143 --> 06:03.058
and she's coming
to the fucking gig.

06:03.188 --> 06:05.147
- What? What?
- Oh, my God.

06:05.277 --> 06:06.322
- We're gonna

- Oh, yeah. I know.
We need a fucking drummer,

we've auditioned sucks.

06:18.073 --> 06:19.814
- Like, really suck.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.903
- Yes, I know.
And it needs to be a girl,

06:22.033 --> 06:23.774
because Lisa specifically said

06:23.905 --> 06:25.428
that she wants
an all-girl lineup,

06:25.559 --> 06:28.039
and Atlantic has been looking
to sign an all-girl band.

06:28.170 --> 06:29.780
- Okay.
So we gotta find a drummer,

06:29.911 --> 06:30.738
and she's gotta be a girl.

06:30.868 --> 06:32.174
- So what do you think?

06:32.304 --> 06:33.697
I should ask Tammy again,
right?

06:33.828 --> 06:35.003
- Yeah. I mean,
she was pretty great, right?

06:35.133 --> 06:36.265
- Yes. Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.658
- Yeah, do it.
- Talk to Tammy.

06:37.788 --> 06:38.702
- I'm gonna make
this fucking happen.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.182
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:40.312 --> 06:41.879

- There he goes.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.672
- We're gonna get
a record deal.

06:51.802 --> 06:52.542
We're gonna get
a fucking record deal.

06:52.673 --> 06:54.022
- Am I dead? Did I die?

06:54.152 --> 06:55.197

right now.

06:55.327 --> 06:56.764
- I could fucking kiss you
right now.

06:56.894 --> 06:58.243
- Tammy still hasn't called.

06:58.374 --> 07:00.028
- Nor will she.

07:00.158 --> 07:01.333
- Maybe I should call her.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.727
- No,
you absolutely should not.

07:03.858 --> 07:06.861
It's over, and you need
to get on with your life.

the last time

07:08.123 --> 07:09.429
you went down and out
like this?

07:09.559 --> 07:11.996
- No, Mom. I don't remember
ever feeling like this.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.737
- You don't remember losing
the state title

07:13.868 --> 07:15.652
your junior year?

07:15.783 --> 07:17.088
- Yeah, that was just rough.

07:17.219 --> 07:20.004
- And what happened
the next year?

07:20.135 --> 07:22.877
- I won states.
- You bet your ass you did.

07:23.007 --> 07:24.835
Because my boy
is not a quitter.

07:24.966 --> 07:26.271
My boy does not
lay down and die.

07:26.402 --> 07:30.101
My boy is a fighter.

07:30.232 --> 07:32.103
Take a look at this
right here.

07:32.234 --> 07:34.062
Look at this boy.
What do you see?

07:34.192 --> 07:36.760
- I don't know.
- A champion.

07:36.891 --> 07:38.458
And do you know
why you became a champion?

07:38.588 --> 07:40.895
It's because after getting
your ass kicked,

07:41.025 --> 07:42.505
do you remember
what you did?

07:42.636 --> 07:46.335
You picked yourself up,
and you worked your butt off.

07:46.466 --> 07:50.034
And that's exactly what you
need to start doing right now.

07:50.165 --> 07:52.297
You need to find
that fight again.

07:52.428 --> 07:54.604
Just get out there
and meet somebody new.

07:54.735 --> 07:55.997
- Yeah.

07:56.127 --> 07:57.999
- Oh, hey. Tammy.

07:58.129 --> 07:59.348
Ah,
sorry to bother you at work.

07:59.479 --> 08:03.700
Just, um, I got a situation.

08:03.831 --> 08:05.528
Not a situation.
It's--it's good.

08:05.659 --> 08:08.923
It's--I got a question.
I just need to talk to you.

We need you in the band.

08:19.542 --> 08:22.153
And--and--and before
you say anything,

08:22.284 --> 08:24.504
we have a huge
opportunity here,

08:24.634 --> 08:26.984
and we have a chance
to get a record deal.

08:27.115 --> 08:29.204
And we've tried to find
someone else to play drums,

08:29.334 --> 08:30.814
but no one's as good as you.

08:30.945 --> 08:32.163
And, Tammy,

08:32.294 --> 08:34.252
I mean,
we have a chance here for--

08:34.383 --> 08:37.995
for rock and roll glory.
I mean, seriously.

08:38.126 --> 08:39.823
It's--I just think
you'd be crazy to pass it up.

08:39.954 --> 08:41.956
- Pags,
how could I even do that, hmm?

08:42.086 --> 08:43.087
I mean, sorry,
but I'm still in school,

08:43.218 --> 08:44.872
and I'm working here.

08:45.002 --> 08:47.439
I don't really have the time
to be in a band right now.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.180
That's just--
- I mean, Tammy, how many--

08:49.311 --> 08:51.922
how many chances
do you get like this?

08:52.053 --> 08:54.882
I'm offering you a once-
in-a-lifetime opportunity here.

08:55.012 --> 08:57.101
- Yeah, I know. I know.

08:57.232 --> 08:59.147
I just--I don't--
I don't see it, Pags.

08:59.277 --> 09:01.802
I mean, I don't see me
in a rock band, you know,

09:01.932 --> 09:05.501
I'm--I'm not--
I'm not that girl.

09:05.632 --> 09:09.026
- But you are that girl, Tammy.
I saw you that night.

09:09.157 --> 09:13.117
I saw how happy and alive
you were on that stage.

09:13.248 --> 09:15.206
I mean, don't you want
to feel that again?

09:15.337 --> 09:17.339
And that, that was--that was
some tiny little club.

09:17.469 --> 09:19.994
I mean, think about doing that
in front of thousands

09:20.124 --> 09:22.866
and thousands of people
in a stadium.

09:22.997 --> 09:25.477
I mean, because if we--
if we cut this record,

09:25.608 --> 09:28.263
they'll put us on tour opening
for one of the bigger acts.

09:28.393 --> 09:31.614
I mean--I mean, by this time
next year we could be in Tokyo

09:31.745 --> 09:34.138
on a world tour opening
for the fucking Pretenders.

09:34.269 --> 09:36.010
- God, do you really think
that could happen?

09:36.140 --> 09:37.838
Like, do you really think
that Wildfire--

09:37.968 --> 09:39.840
- Tammy, am I working
by myself today?

09:39.970 --> 09:43.495
- Oh, yeah. No. Yeah.
I'm--I'm going.

09:43.626 --> 09:45.889
No, sorry. Pags.
No, this is crazy.

09:46.020 --> 09:47.238
I have to--
I have to get back to work.

09:47.369 --> 09:49.197
- Tammy, you're being...

09:51.982 --> 09:54.594
We have a chance
of rock and roll glory.

10:03.211 --> 10:06.518
- Yo-ho-ho! Look at you!

10:06.649 --> 10:08.085
Out of the house,
out of the robe,

10:08.216 --> 10:09.696
and even going for a run?

10:09.826 --> 10:11.175
- I'm back, baby.

10:11.306 --> 10:13.003
Like I said,
no more crying in my beer.

10:13.134 --> 10:14.918
No more feeling sorry
for myself.

10:15.049 --> 10:16.311
You know,
it's just another day.

10:16.441 --> 10:17.965
Time to get back
in the saddle.

10:18.095 --> 10:19.444
But listen, I need a favor
from you, though.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.403
- Yeah, anything.
- I wanna go out tonight.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.491
I wanna know what
I've been missing out on.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.319
You know what I'm saying?

10:24.449 --> 10:25.973
But I need my wingman with me.
So what do you say?

10:26.103 --> 10:27.583
- Are you kidding me?
If it means you're done

10:27.714 --> 10:29.411
moping around, then yeah,
of course I'll be there.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.805
- Yes, dude.
I'll see you tonight, huh?

10:31.935 --> 10:32.806
- You know it.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.073
- Hey, Dad, you home?

10:39.203 --> 10:41.118
- In the kitchen.

10:41.249 --> 10:43.033
[chuckles]

10:43.164 --> 10:45.906
- Another day, another letter.

10:46.036 --> 10:47.211
You want me to read it to you?

10:48.604 --> 10:51.346
- As much as I liked her,
Jimbo, I think I'll pass.

10:51.476 --> 10:52.303
- You want another beer?

10:52.434 --> 10:54.305
- No, I'm good.

10:54.436 --> 11:00.137
- Oh, Dad, I gotta tell you,
she's just incredible.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.139
I swear, after Jill,

11:02.270 --> 11:04.098
I didn't think I could feel
this way with somebody else.

11:04.228 --> 11:08.276
But it's even more intense
with Maya, you know?

11:08.406 --> 11:10.234
You know, it's like--

11:10.365 --> 11:11.627
it's like we're supposed
to be together,

11:11.758 --> 11:14.674
you know,
like, we're a perfect match.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.501
You know, we both--
we both love to travel.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.416
We love the outdoors.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.377
You--you were worried
about the long-distance thing,

11:22.507 --> 11:26.033
but this is how you
make it work, communication.

11:26.163 --> 11:28.209
- Damn, you seem smitten.

11:28.339 --> 11:29.950
- "Dear, Jimmy,
it breaks my heart

11:30.080 --> 11:32.213
to have to do this
in a letter."

11:33.127 --> 11:36.608
- Okay, I'll let you
finish that in here.

11:36.739 --> 11:39.742
And I'll finish this sandwich
in the backyard.

11:49.012 --> 11:51.449
- Hey, Ma,
I got the groceries.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.408
Anything else I can get you,
Your Majesty?

11:53.538 --> 11:56.063
- Hey, honey. Come in here.
We got a special guest.

11:56.193 --> 11:57.151
- What?

11:58.674 --> 12:01.372
- Oh. Hey, Mr. Ross.
How are you?

12:01.503 --> 12:02.634
- How are you, Jill?

12:02.765 --> 12:04.506
I was hoping
we could have a word.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.116
- Yeah, Jill, take a seat.
We wanna talk to you.

12:06.247 --> 12:07.596
- What is this, like,
an intervention or something?

12:07.727 --> 12:09.424
- Yeah, you could
put it like that.

12:09.554 --> 12:11.469
- Okay.

12:11.600 --> 12:16.213
- So your beautiful mother, who
I must say looks fantastic...

12:16.344 --> 12:18.999
- Thank you. You know,
Jill actually made this dress.

12:19.129 --> 12:21.436
- Did she?
I am impressed, Jill.

12:21.566 --> 12:22.654
- I mean, so talented.

12:22.785 --> 12:24.526
Why doesn't she have
a full-time job?

12:24.656 --> 12:28.573
- Ma, enough with that.
Mr. Ross, what's going on?

12:28.704 --> 12:30.358
- Your beautiful mother
and I were talking,

12:30.488 --> 12:32.316
and we both hate the idea
that our two little girls

12:32.447 --> 12:35.189
are letting some schmuck
get between youse.

12:35.319 --> 12:38.192
So I had to reach out,
see if I could help.

12:38.322 --> 12:39.802
- Really?
That's why you're here?

12:39.933 --> 12:41.630
- Yeah, it's important to us.
You two have been friends

12:41.761 --> 12:44.459
since you were this high,
and we can't have this.

12:44.589 --> 12:47.984
You two not talking to one
another, it's no good, Jill.

12:48.115 --> 12:49.333
- And you wanna know
the worst of it, Louie?

12:49.464 --> 12:51.683
- What?
- This guy she was seeing...

12:51.814 --> 12:53.511
- Mom, I'm warning you.
- He was married.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.470
- Mom!
- No,

12:55.600 --> 12:57.602
a married man,
disgrazia.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.256
- I know.
It's terrible. Right?

12:59.387 --> 13:01.737
- Why are we discussing this?
It's over.

13:01.868 --> 13:04.087
I'm not seeing him anymore,
which is what you wanted.

13:04.218 --> 13:06.350
So could we just leave it
in the past, please?

13:06.481 --> 13:07.699
- Well, I could tell you
right there, Jill,

13:07.830 --> 13:10.441
it's the married man thing
that has Stacey so upset.

13:10.572 --> 13:13.053
I mean, after what her mother
did to us,

13:13.183 --> 13:15.011
she's gonna have
a severe allergic reaction

13:15.142 --> 13:17.057
to an extramarital anything.

13:17.187 --> 13:18.580
- Uch, I forgot about that,Louie.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.321
- Well...
- Who--who was that guy

13:20.451 --> 13:21.539
she was messing around
with again?

13:21.670 --> 13:23.759
- Some asshole she met
doing summer stock.

13:23.890 --> 13:26.501
- Yeah, but who was he?
Was he a musician?

13:26.631 --> 13:27.415
Because I never met a musician

13:27.545 --> 13:28.808
could keep his hands
to himself.

13:28.938 --> 13:31.549
- You see this, Jill,
your mother knows things.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.508
Piano player.

13:33.638 --> 13:35.815
Yeah, and I thought about
having his fingers broken,

13:35.945 --> 13:39.079
but then I figured
it wasn't his fault. Right?

13:39.209 --> 13:40.384
I mean, he just thought
he was having a great time

13:40.515 --> 13:42.604
banging some hot broad.
He didn't know us.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.998
He didn't know what
he was doing to our family.

13:45.128 --> 13:46.564
- Poor man.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.305
- But she knew,
and I'm telling you,

13:48.436 --> 13:51.265
that's what's so heartbreaking
about this whole thing,

13:51.395 --> 13:55.095
that she could do that
to our own family.

13:55.225 --> 13:58.228
But you know what
I still regret?

13:58.359 --> 13:59.577
Not breaking
his fucking fingers.

13:59.708 --> 14:02.450
[laughter]

14:02.580 --> 14:04.147
So, come on, Jill.

14:04.278 --> 14:06.193
Now that you know
the ugly sordid details,

14:06.323 --> 14:08.282
what can we do to make this
right with you kids?

14:08.412 --> 14:09.457
- Yeah, why don't you
just call Stacey?

14:09.587 --> 14:11.111
Give her an--
an olive branch.

14:11.241 --> 14:13.113
- See,
your mother nailed it again.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.245
I think a phone call
would go a long way.

14:15.376 --> 14:17.291
Yeah, unless of course you're
okay with just walking away

14:17.421 --> 14:20.816
from a lifelong friendship,
and who am I to talk?

14:20.947 --> 14:23.993
- I think I'll make the call
outside, but thank you.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.908
Mr. Ross, always a pleasure.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.914
- [exhales]
Thank you so much.

14:32.045 --> 14:33.568
I never thought I'd get her
out of the fucking house.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.135
- Ah, come on.
This is what I do.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.877
- In a letter.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.269
She breaks up with me
in a fucking letter.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.662
- I mean, in--in her defense,

14:40.792 --> 14:42.490
isn't she in, like,
Sweden or some shit?

14:42.620 --> 14:44.492
I mean, that is a pretty
expensive long-distance--

14:44.622 --> 14:46.537
- You know, you're not being
fucking helpful here, Mikey.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.278
- Look, I'm sorry. Okay?

14:48.409 --> 14:49.366
I know how tough
this is for you.

14:49.497 --> 14:51.368
Trust me. I know.

14:51.499 --> 14:53.762
And unlike you and Pags,
I'm not gonna break your balls.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.417
And I'm definitely not gonna
sing some sad breakup song

14:56.547 --> 14:57.679
that is gonna
bring you to tears.

14:57.809 --> 14:59.855
No. Instead,
I'm gonna be here for you.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.466
Why? 'Cause I'm
a good fucking friend.

15:02.597 --> 15:04.642
So tell me,
what reason did she give you?

15:04.773 --> 15:06.818
- She already signed on
for another job.

15:06.949 --> 15:10.213
She won't be back till after
the holidays at the earliest.

15:10.344 --> 15:11.911
Given she's gonna be gone
that long, she figures

15:12.041 --> 15:15.697
it'll just be easier to,
you know, break up.

15:15.827 --> 15:18.395
- Okay.

15:18.526 --> 15:20.920
I'm gonna give you the gift
my mother just gave to me.

15:21.050 --> 15:23.748
Look at me. You're gonna
go out there tonight,

15:23.879 --> 15:24.793
and you're gonna make
something happen, all right?

15:24.924 --> 15:26.577
You're gonna meet
somebody new.

15:26.708 --> 15:28.188
No, listen to me. Yes.

15:28.318 --> 15:30.233
Why?
'Cause my boy is not a quitter.

15:30.364 --> 15:31.800
All right? My boy
doesn't just lay down and die.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.282
My boy is a fighter.
You hear me?

15:35.412 --> 15:36.936
Okay. Then it's settled.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.633
Me and you, we go up
to the Tavern tonight.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.635
We're gonna have some fun.
We're gonna meet some girls.

15:40.765 --> 15:41.897
You're gonna meet a beauty
that'll help you forget

15:42.028 --> 15:44.465
all about her, all right?
That's it.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.119
I'm not taking no
for an answer.

15:46.249 --> 15:48.425
[telephone rings]

15:48.556 --> 15:50.906
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Jill.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.734
- Oh, hey. What's up?
- Nothing.

15:52.864 --> 15:56.564
Just, you know,
calling to check in.

15:56.694 --> 15:57.913
See how you are.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.262
- Did my father
put you up to this?

15:59.393 --> 16:00.481
- No.

16:00.611 --> 16:03.440
I mean, kind of.
He's at the house.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.181
Just told me about
why my relationship with Henry

16:05.312 --> 16:06.748
might be so upsetting to you.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.619
- Oh, yeah. And why is that?

16:08.750 --> 16:11.709
- Because of your mom
with the piano player.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.626
Stace, I'm sorry. I had no idea
that's why they got divorced.

16:15.757 --> 16:16.976
Why would you never
tell me that?

16:17.106 --> 16:18.803
- Because it's fucking
embarrassing, Jill.

16:18.934 --> 16:20.066
- It's not
fucking embarrassing.

16:20.196 --> 16:21.719
You kidding me?

16:21.850 --> 16:24.635
After all the shit you've seen
my mom go through, you...

16:24.766 --> 16:26.681
I mean, I get it.

16:26.811 --> 16:28.422
Also, for what it's worth,
I'm not seeing Henry anymore.

16:28.552 --> 16:29.771
- That's good.

16:29.901 --> 16:32.730
- I also wanna apologize
for just

16:32.861 --> 16:36.517
how I've been behaving
these past few months.

16:36.647 --> 16:37.779
Just coming home at all hours,

16:37.909 --> 16:40.521
not being respectful
of your schedule,

16:40.651 --> 16:41.565
basically just being a fuck up.

16:41.696 --> 16:42.958
- [chuckles]

16:43.089 --> 16:45.526
- And more importantly,
I miss you.

16:47.049 --> 16:50.313
- Really?
Because I miss you too.

16:50.444 --> 16:51.836
- Really?

16:51.967 --> 16:53.447
- So are you gonna keep living
at your mom's,

16:53.577 --> 16:55.884
or do you maybe wanna
move back in with me?

16:56.015 --> 16:59.279
