01:33.260 --> 01:35.195
And there's Parliament to consider.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.196
And The Times.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.831
Oh, forget all that.

01:37.898 --> 01:40.467
How are we going to get this
past me Ma and Da?

01:40.533 --> 01:41.935
Why?

01:42.002 --> 01:44.271
Don't you think they'll approve of me?

01:47.074 --> 01:49.042
I suppose me Ma will
find you charming enough.

01:49.109 --> 01:52.112
But me Da,
he doesn't go in for politics.

01:52.179 --> 01:54.147
He socked a county clerk
in the nose once

01:54.214 --> 01:56.349
just for campaigning too near his pub.

01:56.416 --> 01:57.918
Did he?

02:01.421 --> 02:03.724
Could we pretend you were
a professor or such...

02:11.031 --> 02:12.766
Always loved that story.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.067
Downing Street.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.437
She owed one scene on it when she died.

02:17.504 --> 02:19.606
We'd shoot it with a double,

02:19.673 --> 02:22.042
find a voice double to loop her lines.

02:22.109 --> 02:23.844
Maybe Bess.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.913
She made a fine Minna.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.982
It'd be a fitting tribute to her,
Monroe.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.853
God, she was good.

02:34.454 --> 02:36.189
And it'd be found money,

02:36.256 --> 02:39.226
help us get out from under Mayer,
the prick.

02:39.292 --> 02:41.995
But if you're uncomfortable
with it in any way...

02:47.034 --> 02:49.569
I'm not.

02:49.636 --> 02:52.672
Wouldn't it be something
if she ended up saving us again?

02:55.843 --> 02:58.445
The drudgery tour continues.

02:58.511 --> 03:01.448
Today's my last day in wardrobe.
Starting in props tomorrow.

03:01.514 --> 03:02.916
Fine, as long as being a stuntman

03:02.983 --> 03:04.251
isn't next on your list.

03:04.317 --> 03:07.154
Is there some reason you're
not writing at the moment?

03:07.220 --> 03:09.256
There is.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.692
Finished it an hour ago.

03:12.760 --> 03:13.994
Aubrey, congratulations.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.839
Well, you're supposed to
say that after you read it.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.230
Which will be when?

03:17.297 --> 03:19.166
I'm done here at six.
Six?

03:19.232 --> 03:21.334
You're 19, I'm giving you first-look.
Play hooky.

03:21.401 --> 03:23.837
I can't.
What are they gonna do, fire you?

03:23.904 --> 03:27.007
Worse. They'll stop taking me seriously.

03:27.074 --> 03:28.375
I'll read it tonight.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.477
Notes on your desk by 8:00 a.m.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.279
What if you don't have any?

03:34.381 --> 03:35.548
Thank you.

03:35.615 --> 03:37.384
I'm very excited.

03:37.450 --> 03:38.952
You ought to be.

03:57.270 --> 03:59.773
Now, that's not quite Minna, Bess.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.641
Would it help you to hear another clip

04:01.708 --> 04:02.843
from earlier in the picture?

04:02.910 --> 04:04.311
No, Odelle.

04:04.377 --> 04:06.579
Thank you.

04:06.646 --> 04:08.581
Let's just try it again.

04:08.648 --> 04:10.083
All right.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.919
Me daughter tells me

04:11.985 --> 04:13.787
you're in politics.

04:13.854 --> 04:16.223
In a fashion, if you like.

04:16.289 --> 04:17.490
I don't.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.961
That felt better. Didn't it?

04:21.028 --> 04:24.464
I wonder if more sessions might help.

04:24.531 --> 04:26.934
I'll-I'll get the hang of it.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.870
I was Minna, wasn't I?

04:30.938 --> 04:33.506
Yes, you were.

04:35.876 --> 04:38.511
Mr. Stahr?

04:45.618 --> 04:48.188
There's a saying, in Yiddish.

04:49.857 --> 04:53.961
A tate darft nisht a
shpigl ven er hat gehat a zin.

04:56.163 --> 04:59.699
"A man no longer needs a mirror

04:59.766 --> 05:02.569
once he has had a son."

05:04.504 --> 05:07.040
My Irving.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.742
My boychik.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.946
He was the perfect partner,

05:13.013 --> 05:16.249
the perfect friend.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.354
An inspiration,

05:21.421 --> 05:25.558
a born storyteller,
sometimes a taskmaster.

05:27.627 --> 05:29.296
He was a movie man.

05:30.898 --> 05:37.170
But you will never see his name
on a single picture of ours.

05:39.439 --> 05:41.608
That bothered me,

05:41.674 --> 05:45.178
but I always believed if
I hectored him enough about it,

05:45.245 --> 05:48.381
he'd eventually give in,
he'd put his name on the screen.

05:51.151 --> 05:54.487
I thought I had time to win that one.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.291
I was wrong.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.394
And now my son,

06:01.461 --> 06:04.231
my mirror, is dead.

06:12.605 --> 06:14.607
Mayer.

06:14.674 --> 06:16.509
He hated Thalberg.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.413
And now he gets to replace him.
Hmm.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.951
"My son is dead." Oh, Kristus.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.353
And Mayer'd do it, too, just to fuck me.

06:26.419 --> 06:28.121
Well...

06:28.188 --> 06:30.323
he can offer control.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.759
And as big a bankroll as Monroe likes.

06:32.825 --> 06:33.961
But Monroe wouldn't.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.930
He'd never do that to me.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.398
Yeah.

06:38.465 --> 06:39.599
Probably.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.601
He wouldn't do that to me.

06:43.536 --> 06:46.974
If you heard anything concrete,
you'd tell me, right?

06:47.040 --> 06:48.741
You have to ask?
Yeah.

06:48.808 --> 06:51.111
Ah, it's hell, having family.

06:53.380 --> 06:56.483
You know who we should hire?
Norman Krasna.

06:56.549 --> 06:58.051
Oh, heck of a writer.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.520
But I thought you hated his work.
I was wrong.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.588
He's brilliant.

07:01.654 --> 07:03.156
What turned you around?

07:03.223 --> 07:06.026
Did a hell of a job on Mayer's eulogy.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.595
Beautiful. Didn't you think?

07:32.885 --> 07:35.022
Monroe?

07:36.923 --> 07:39.859
Is it bad form to discuss
a script at a funeral?

07:39.926 --> 07:42.762
Yes. Shameful.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.097
Why?

07:44.164 --> 07:45.932
Just that Aubrey turned in a great draft

07:45.999 --> 07:47.700
of An Enemy Among Us.

07:47.767 --> 07:50.703
Thought you might want to start
thinking about directors.

07:50.770 --> 07:53.540
Congratulations, Celia.

07:53.606 --> 07:56.743
You're starting to turn into
a first-rate producer.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.578
And a second-rate human being.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.581
Thank you.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.476
If you keep this up,

08:29.542 --> 08:32.479
one of us is gonna
have to switch religions.

08:33.746 --> 08:38.085
We're both salesmen, you and I.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.820
I don't think that's true.
No?

08:40.886 --> 08:43.490
We both sell myth.

08:43.556 --> 08:46.859
Except mine are myths people can see.

08:46.926 --> 08:49.762
God's not a myth.

08:49.829 --> 08:52.399
No?

08:52.465 --> 08:55.034
The Bible isn't just stories?

08:55.102 --> 08:57.770
Noah's not a story? A really good story?

08:59.972 --> 09:02.475
How's a movie any different?

09:02.542 --> 09:04.244
Try this.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.814
A woman enters her apartment.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.349
It's nighttime.

09:09.416 --> 09:12.252
She's wearing black gloves.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.087
She empties out her purse.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.789
Two dimes and one nickel.

09:16.856 --> 09:19.459
She puts the dimes back in her purse,

09:19.526 --> 09:22.962
but places the nickel on a
shelf beneath a bottle of rye.

09:23.029 --> 09:24.831
On the stove is a matchbox.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.166
One match left inside it.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.836
She puts the gloves inside the oven,
then lights it.

09:31.804 --> 09:33.406
Her phone rings.

09:33.473 --> 09:35.675
She picks it up, then says,

09:35.742 --> 09:39.045
"I've never owned a pair
of black gloves in my life."

09:39.112 --> 09:40.847
Then leaves.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.118
Do you see?

09:45.185 --> 09:46.819
What was the nickel for?

09:48.355 --> 09:50.357
I have no idea,
I was just making pictures,

09:50.423 --> 09:51.691
but you were interested.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.560
What makes you say that?

09:53.626 --> 09:56.329
Why else would you ask about the nickel?

09:57.797 --> 09:59.098
See?

09:59.166 --> 10:00.667
Story.

10:00.733 --> 10:03.836
You seem so insistent upon proving to me

10:03.903 --> 10:05.037
that movies matter.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.239
Yes.
Why?

10:06.306 --> 10:09.142
Because people die for them.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.644
Someday I will, too.

10:11.711 --> 10:13.880
All right.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.482
They matter.

10:17.550 --> 10:18.550
Thank you.

10:18.585 --> 10:21.254
Now tell me the rest of your sins.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.492
Pat, do you want me to get a job?

10:25.558 --> 10:27.860
Why would you get a job?

10:27.927 --> 10:29.662
I don't know.

10:29.729 --> 10:31.298
To help out.

10:32.965 --> 10:36.269
Do you want me to cancel
our Christmas trip?

10:36.336 --> 10:38.571
What is with you tonight?

10:38.638 --> 10:40.807
I don't mind living picture to picture,

10:40.873 --> 10:43.310
always thinking that it's
all gonna come to an end,

10:43.376 --> 10:45.945
and it's certainly not
the first mortgage

10:46.012 --> 10:48.147
you took out to finance one.

10:50.082 --> 10:52.151
I mean, we could spend less.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.120
I haven't failed us yet, have I?

10:54.187 --> 10:55.121
No.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.990
I don't know.

10:58.057 --> 10:59.792
Irving dying...

11:01.661 --> 11:04.897
Perhaps it's time for me
to consult my crystal ball.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.668
Sure.

11:12.339 --> 11:15.074
Okay.

11:15.141 --> 11:17.977
Shyness is gonna have
a negative cost of $900,000,

11:18.044 --> 11:20.513
with another $100,000
for prints and advertising.

11:20.580 --> 11:24.884
It'll bring in $4 million domestic,
and, eh,

11:24.951 --> 11:27.086
six, $700,000 overseas.

11:27.153 --> 11:28.455
Oh.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.523
Downing Street...

11:30.590 --> 11:33.626
that's pure profit,
because we wrote it off two years ago.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.761
Mm-hmm.

11:34.827 --> 11:38.331
And... figure the same $100,000 for P&A,

11:38.398 --> 11:39.966
wide release; I think we're looking at

11:40.032 --> 11:42.435
maybe three, three-point-two.

11:42.502 --> 11:46.239
And we are back in clover.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.875
And the weather next Thursday?

11:48.941 --> 11:51.878
Sunny.

11:51.944 --> 11:54.381
Very sunny.

12:12.665 --> 12:14.643
I don't think
you're understanding the scene.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.147
She wants to sleep with Agent Willard.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.471
Whatever she does is in place
of sleeping with him.

12:18.538 --> 12:19.939
No, but she's stalling here.

12:20.006 --> 12:21.908
She's afraid, simple as that.

12:21.974 --> 12:25.211
People don't have
three emotions at once.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.814
I do.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.549
And why doesn't she keep the lunch date

12:29.616 --> 12:31.318
with her boyfriend on page 72?

12:31.384 --> 12:32.652
She's too ashamed of herself.

12:32.719 --> 12:35.522
But what people are ashamed of
usually makes a good story.

12:35.588 --> 12:39.191
The picture needs more
of her inner world, her pain.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.693
The better we get to know her,

12:40.760 --> 12:42.695
the more we'll fear for her at the end.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.931
My God, you sound just like Monroe.

12:44.997 --> 12:48.501
Thank God you got over
that crush on him.

12:48.568 --> 12:53.272
Aubrey, what matters is
he's got a crush on this movie.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.975
I saw it in his eyes.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.877
Let's not blow it, okay?

12:59.746 --> 13:01.948
Beautiful home she has here.

13:02.014 --> 13:03.783
Did you know her in Germany?

13:03.850 --> 13:05.552
Only vaguely.

13:05.618 --> 13:09.088
But we emigres have to take care
of one another.

13:09.155 --> 13:11.290
Hmm.
Please.

13:13.960 --> 13:17.997
So, you were saying, uh,
your fictional world.

13:18.064 --> 13:19.799
Brinel.
Yes.

13:19.866 --> 13:22.735
Yeah, the script's not done yet,
but it's going to be perfect.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.404
And perfect for you to direct.

13:24.471 --> 13:29.075
But word in our little circle
is that the German consul here

13:29.141 --> 13:31.844
isn't too pleased about it.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.746
Herr Gyssling.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.782
That's a point of pride for me.

13:35.848 --> 13:38.785
But you see, I just escaped the Nazis.

13:38.851 --> 13:41.354
Why would I want
to come all the way here

13:41.421 --> 13:43.456
just to antagonize them again?

13:43.523 --> 13:44.924
Because if we don't stop them now,

13:44.991 --> 13:48.127
there won't be anywhere to escape to.

13:48.194 --> 13:50.029
Marlene.

13:50.096 --> 13:51.431
Miss Dietrich.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.166
Mr. Stahr.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.168
Here to take a look at the Alps?

13:56.235 --> 13:59.071
Just a bit of Vienna.

14:03.309 --> 14:04.877
Pity about Irving.

14:04.944 --> 14:06.779
So young.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.515
Were you close?

14:08.581 --> 14:10.883
I wish we'd been closer.

14:18.725 --> 14:21.728
My, but you are a clever one.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.739
You've been in town three days,
and you're already living

14:23.763 --> 14:25.331
with an international movie star, Fritz.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.933
You must be pretty clever yours...

14:35.975 --> 14:38.911
Your wife stayed in Germany, didn't she?

14:38.978 --> 14:43.182
Traded you for a Nazi pin
and married the party.

14:43.249 --> 14:45.818
Now imagine something.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.821
She walks into a theater in Munich,
sees this picture,

14:48.888 --> 14:51.658
a giant middle finger to Hitler.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.861
You'd really want that
to be directed by someone else?

15:05.572 --> 15:08.007
You wanted to see me, Mr. Brady?

15:08.074 --> 15:10.777
Miner. Come on in.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.414
I got an opportunity for you.

15:15.482 --> 15:18.150
Oh. Yes, sir.

15:18.217 --> 15:19.519
Miner, do you freely accept

15:19.586 --> 15:22.622
that I am now your Lord and Savior?

15:35.167 --> 15:36.803
Bernadette.

15:39.138 --> 15:40.973
How's school?

15:41.040 --> 15:42.475
How's your class?

15:42.542 --> 15:43.810
Well enough.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.112
I spend most of my days
breaking up fights

15:46.178 --> 15:47.213
and cleaning up messes.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.015
Funny, so do I.

15:52.218 --> 15:55.522
I was thinking of you the other day,
at Irving's funeral.

15:57.189 --> 16:00.993
It hit me that you're the only
family I've got left out here.

16:04.430 --> 16:06.733
Please.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.609
Do you need money?

16:16.676 --> 16:18.477
No, I'm not here for money.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.680
I'm here for Dex.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.654
Took me weeks to work up the nerve.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.757
It's something he was doing on his own.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.359
And he was always afraid
to show it to you.

16:33.425 --> 16:36.529
And he was very proud of it, I think.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.297
Will you read it?

16:38.364 --> 16:39.766
Of course.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.901
Just because he's gone

16:41.968 --> 16:44.737
doesn't mean he's not
still under contract.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.095
Hello.

17:15.968 --> 17:17.904
I'm Rose.

17:19.806 --> 17:22.108
I'm the brain tumor in 208.

17:22.174 --> 17:25.578
Is that what you'd like me to call you?

17:27.579 --> 17:30.049
I'm Kitty.

17:30.116 --> 17:33.352
Where you from?

17:33.419 --> 17:35.021
From Portland.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.626
But lately, a bridge under Sixth Street.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.127
Couldn't find work?

17:41.193 --> 17:43.696
Well, I came here to be an artist,

17:43.763 --> 17:46.933
and it turns out
they had artists here already.

17:46.999 --> 17:49.702
So...
Who told you you have a brain tumor?

17:49.769 --> 17:53.572
I passed out in a movie theater.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.708
Marx Brothers picture.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.310
Can I get another blanket?

18:06.218 --> 18:08.154
Thank you.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.693
Do you need anything else?

18:13.760 --> 18:16.896
Do you know any jokes?

18:20.700 --> 18:22.935
I don't, uh...

18:23.002 --> 18:25.071
I think I'm dying.

18:29.208 --> 18:30.643
No.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.648
So...

18:35.715 --> 18:38.117
two guys walk into a bar...

18:38.184 --> 18:41.053
You don't want to put on too much, okay?

18:41.120 --> 18:43.222
But you want to make sure it's even.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.557
You sure this isn't stealing, Max?

18:45.624 --> 18:47.593
It's called publicity, Nathan.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.196
Studios pay people to do this.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.532
She's gonna be like Mitzi Green.

18:53.599 --> 18:55.902
That's what everyone's saying.

18:58.170 --> 19:00.539
Who is?

19:00.606 --> 19:03.609
Lana. She was playing the lead.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.577
Now she's gonna be a star.

19:05.644 --> 19:06.884
Maybe I didn't practice enough.

19:06.913 --> 19:09.381
Oh, you practiced great.

19:09.448 --> 19:10.983
You did great.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.987
Nathan, set the table.

19:17.323 --> 19:21.527
You know, I saw a lot of kids
make a lot of mistakes,

19:21.593 --> 19:23.395
and you didn't make any.

19:23.462 --> 19:25.097
And it's just a school play.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.834
So how come that producer who was there

19:27.900 --> 19:30.436
gave his card to Lana and not to me?

19:30.502 --> 19:32.972
Because you were in the chorus.

19:33.039 --> 19:35.674
Okay?

19:35.742 --> 19:36.976
Dinner's ready.

19:38.277 --> 19:41.113
I'll get the lead next time.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.516
Then everyone will be watching me.

19:44.583 --> 19:47.419
It's nice to think about anyway.

19:47.486 --> 19:49.355
Nathan.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.959
Bless us, O Lord, for these, thy gifts,

19:53.025 --> 19:54.693
which we are about to receive...

20:05.237 --> 20:06.773
Can you cook?

20:06.839 --> 20:08.474
What?

20:10.209 --> 20:12.011
When I tell my mother about you,

20:12.078 --> 20:15.214
it'll be the second question she asks.

20:15.281 --> 20:16.515
Can you?

20:16.582 --> 20:18.284
Reasonably.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.421
What else will you tell her?

20:22.488 --> 20:24.791
That I'm happy.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.229
I'm happy, too.

20:32.098 --> 20:35.467
Quick,
lock the doors and bar the windows,

20:35.534 --> 20:38.404
before someone comes
and takes it all away.

20:38.470 --> 20:41.107
No one's gonna take it away.

20:48.815 --> 20:51.417
Do you ever think about stopping?

20:51.483 --> 20:54.586
Stopping what?

20:54.653 --> 20:57.056
Work.

20:57.123 --> 21:00.326
They just put a 37-year-old
boy genius in the ground.

21:02.728 --> 21:04.931
Do you ever think about it?

21:04.997 --> 21:07.133
Taking time off?

21:15.274 --> 21:17.409
Shangri-La.

21:22.348 --> 21:24.083
Louis Mayer.

21:24.150 --> 21:31.223
Me daughter tells me you're in politics.

21:33.926 --> 21:36.863
I'm just not feeling her spirit from...

21:36.929 --> 21:39.065
Any luck?

21:39.131 --> 21:41.200
Oh.

21:43.735 --> 21:45.537
Hello, L.B.

21:45.604 --> 21:47.373
Pat. How's Margo?

21:47.439 --> 21:48.740
How's your house?

21:48.807 --> 21:50.609
Fine and fine, thanks.

21:50.676 --> 21:52.111
To what do we owe the pleasure?

21:52.178 --> 21:53.612
Trying to find you a proper Minna.

21:53.679 --> 21:55.719
I brought you half my stable.
Well, gee, Monroe.

21:55.747 --> 21:57.984
Why don't you just ask
your girlfriend to do it?

21:58.050 --> 21:59.886
She's Irish.

21:59.952 --> 22:01.587
I don't think that'd be a good idea.

22:01.653 --> 22:04.356
We all have to suffer for our art,
Monroe. Tell him, Louis.

22:04.423 --> 22:07.526
I also dropped in
on a Sally Sweet rehearsal.

22:07.593 --> 22:09.561
And?
Fine.

22:09.628 --> 22:11.630
Shirley Temple shouldn't
lose any sleep over her.

22:11.697 --> 22:15.101
And, would it kill you
to jazz up the script a little?

22:15.167 --> 22:17.937
It's a bit trite, no?

22:18.004 --> 22:20.839
Which reminds me,
what do you two think of color?

22:20.907 --> 22:22.875
Think it's swell. Why?

22:22.942 --> 22:24.142
Well, it's an idea Irving had.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.477
He wanted to steal Wizard of Oz

22:25.544 --> 22:27.579
from Goldwyn and make it in color.

22:27.646 --> 22:29.048
Does that sound crazy to you?

22:29.115 --> 22:32.251
Not at all.
Sounds a little gimmicky to me.

22:32.318 --> 22:34.620
Still haven't found
a replacement for him?

22:36.655 --> 22:40.927
Talent like that doesn't grow on trees,
Pat.

22:40.993 --> 22:44.063
Well, see you two around.

22:50.269 --> 22:54.006
What's wrong with the Sally script?

22:54.073 --> 22:55.641
It is a bit flat.

22:55.707 --> 22:58.010
If you'd let me put
a new writer on it...

22:58.077 --> 22:59.878
See to it then, will you?

23:00.846 --> 23:02.148
Oh.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.116
Almost forgot
why I fucking came in here.

23:04.183 --> 23:07.619
Is it true,
I'm hearing you're courting Fritz Lang?

23:07.686 --> 23:10.489
Yes. He's perfect for Enemy.

23:10.556 --> 23:11.490
It's an American story.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.492
Why ask a German emigre to tell it?

23:13.559 --> 23:16.095
Because he's a German emigre.

23:16.162 --> 23:18.597
You don't find him a little brooding?

23:18.664 --> 23:20.632
No, I think he's a visionary.

23:20.699 --> 23:23.535
What does Louis think?

23:25.604 --> 23:27.039
Couldn't say.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.574
Haven't asked.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.209
That's refreshing.

23:30.276 --> 23:31.610
It's my movie, Pat.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.612
He's my choice.

23:35.147 --> 23:38.784
You're a velvet fucking jackhammer,
aren't you?

23:38.850 --> 23:41.453
And find me a Minna.

23:49.361 --> 23:50.796
So?

23:50.862 --> 23:52.531
Which one did you pick?

23:54.133 --> 23:56.535
I saw 30 would-be Minnas
coming through today.

23:56.602 --> 23:57.703
Who got it?

23:57.769 --> 23:58.804
No one.

23:58.870 --> 24:01.907
They're all wrong.

24:01.974 --> 24:04.176
Well, she'll turn up eventually.

24:04.243 --> 24:08.314
I'm starting to think
she's been here all along.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.683
Would you do it?
Do what?

24:11.750 --> 24:13.485
Be her voice. Minna.

24:13.552 --> 24:15.421
Me?

24:15.487 --> 24:18.991
I need the help.

24:19.058 --> 24:21.994
And no one else
can seem to get it right.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.229
I'm not...

24:23.295 --> 24:25.031
It's just a few lines, Kathleen.

24:25.097 --> 24:28.767
Just a few lines, yeah.

24:28.834 --> 24:31.603
I don't mind doing this.

24:31.670 --> 24:34.806
Really, I-I don't.

24:34.873 --> 24:37.343
It's just, you...

24:37.409 --> 24:39.911
you said I wasn't a stand-in for anyone.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.581
And you're not. You're not.

24:46.352 --> 24:51.223
Do you ever want me
to kiss you like she did?

24:53.092 --> 24:55.394
Touch you like she did?

24:55.461 --> 24:56.895
What?

24:56.962 --> 24:58.697
I can if you want.
No.

24:58.764 --> 25:01.067
I'm sorry. I-I shouldn't have asked.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.935
Do you ever think of her,

25:04.002 --> 25:06.772
when we're...

25:06.838 --> 25:09.675
No.

25:09.741 --> 25:11.677
I do.

25:40.606 --> 25:43.742
Me daughter tells me you're in politics.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.414
You're in poli...

25:48.480 --> 25:52.618
Kathleen, what are you doing?

25:52.684 --> 25:54.086
Getting her voice.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.722
I don't want you to feel
like you have to...

25:56.788 --> 26:00.792
No. Before I ever knew
who Monroe Stahr was...

26:03.929 --> 26:06.198
I was a Minna Davis fan.

26:06.265 --> 26:09.801
I loved her.

26:09.868 --> 26:12.471
We all did.

26:12.538 --> 26:16.275
If you're gonna have someone do this...

26:16.342 --> 26:18.144
then it might as well be

26:18.210 --> 26:21.413
someone who cares
about getting it right.

26:24.316 --> 26:25.817
I love you.

26:33.225 --> 26:36.094
No, you don't.

26:36.162 --> 26:39.131
You're just grateful.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.433
They're not the same thing.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.969
Yes.

26:44.035 --> 26:46.138
They are.

27:05.090 --> 27:07.793
Need some help?

27:07.859 --> 27:09.895
Must be some trick to it.

27:09.961 --> 27:11.763
There is.

27:16.935 --> 27:18.737
It sticks.

27:20.606 --> 27:22.250
Father hasn't replaced
the doors around here

27:22.274 --> 27:23.675
since his first Vilma Ba¡nky picture.

27:23.742 --> 27:26.845
I may not be smart enough
for this place.

27:28.914 --> 27:30.316
How's traffic?

27:30.382 --> 27:34.253
Oh, uh, your father, uh, promoted me.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.022
I'm Mr. Stahr's office boy now.

27:37.088 --> 27:40.759
Oh, so you can spy on him.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.561
Daddy, Daddy.

27:42.628 --> 27:45.764
May I give you the lay of the land, Max?

27:45.831 --> 27:47.165
Yeah, I'd be obliged.

27:47.233 --> 27:49.368
My father is the boss around here,

27:49.435 --> 27:51.437
but Monroe is everyone's hero,

27:51.503 --> 27:53.405
the only person in this whole phony town

27:53.472 --> 27:56.508
who actually behaves like
the characters in our pictures.

27:56.575 --> 27:59.144
It drives my father a little crazy,

27:59.211 --> 28:00.512
because at any other studio,

28:00.579 --> 28:03.148
all the whispering would be about him.

28:03.215 --> 28:05.717
So, he hates Monroe...

28:05.784 --> 28:09.321
and he loves Monroe and he needs Monroe.

28:09.388 --> 28:10.589
It's all a dance.

28:10.656 --> 28:12.123
Hello, Celia.

28:12.190 --> 28:13.959
Max.

28:14.025 --> 28:16.462
Hi, Mr. Stahr.
We weren't doing anything.

28:16.528 --> 28:19.130
Father just made Max
your new office boy, Monroe.

28:19.197 --> 28:20.799
Welcome aboard, Max.

28:20.866 --> 28:23.001
Any spy of Pat's is a friend of mine.

28:23.068 --> 28:25.304
Just do your job with honor.

28:25.371 --> 28:26.705
You'll be fine.

28:26.772 --> 28:29.508
And Celia will show you the ropes.

28:29.575 --> 28:31.209
Is that Aubrey's script?

28:31.277 --> 28:33.312
Yes, as advertised.

28:33.379 --> 28:34.913
Brilliant. Poignant.

28:34.980 --> 28:37.015
Now that he's turned in
a producer's draft,

28:37.082 --> 28:38.784
Oscar-iffic.

28:38.850 --> 28:42.621
Well, so much for managing expectations.

28:48.026 --> 28:49.528
No interruptions, Mary.

28:49.595 --> 28:51.029
Even if it's Mr. Brady?

28:51.096 --> 28:52.431
That's right.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.266
What if it's Mr. Mayer?

28:58.036 --> 28:59.505
He just messengered this over,

28:59.571 --> 29:01.440
says he'd like your thoughts on it.

29:08.847 --> 29:10.449
You know, there's no guarantee

29:10.516 --> 29:12.083
he'll read it in one sitting.

29:12.150 --> 29:13.319
Yes, he will.

29:13.385 --> 29:14.753
He gets interrupted all the time.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.588
I mean, sometimes he makes me wait days.

29:16.655 --> 29:18.123
He won't on this one.

29:18.189 --> 29:19.525
He wouldn't do that to me.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.593
God, I envy your certainty.

29:21.660 --> 29:23.562
Even at 19, I didn't have that.

29:23.629 --> 29:26.798
You either believe in people
or you don't.

29:26.865 --> 29:30.802
I do, even if it means
the occasional pie in the face.

29:41.179 --> 29:42.280
Really?

29:42.348 --> 29:44.282
It's wonderful.

29:44.350 --> 29:46.418
And terrifying.

29:46.485 --> 29:47.953
I love the bit with the hat.

29:48.019 --> 29:49.421
And that scene where she confesses

29:49.488 --> 29:52.023
to her boyfriend over lunch,

29:52.090 --> 29:54.426
and takes Winchester's key?

29:54.493 --> 29:56.528
Well done, Aubrey.
Well done, Aubrey.

29:56.595 --> 29:57.863
By the way, Celia,

29:57.929 --> 29:59.331
your below-the-line days are over.

29:59.398 --> 30:00.699
You're a producer now, full-time.

30:00.766 --> 30:02.568
I start at the mill tomorrow.
No.

30:02.634 --> 30:03.678
This is what you're good at.

30:03.702 --> 30:05.136
Aubrey, grab your pencil.

30:05.203 --> 30:06.472
Let's get to work.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.840
But you said that...
I do.

30:08.907 --> 30:11.510
But that does not mean
it's a picture yet.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.345
All right, first, theme.

30:13.412 --> 30:14.846
There's An Enemy AmongUs, right?

30:14.913 --> 30:18.417
We should see hints
of dishonesty everywhere.

30:18.484 --> 30:19.918
Friends who gossip about each other,

30:19.985 --> 30:22.921
uh, employees who steal
a dollar or two from the till,

30:22.988 --> 30:24.790
the lady down the hall
who's having an affair

30:24.856 --> 30:27.393
and the doorman who looks
the other way to let the guy in.

30:27.459 --> 30:28.870
It should feel like
no one's worth a damn.

30:28.894 --> 30:30.334
Of course. Aubrey, we should do that.

30:30.362 --> 30:34.866
And what are we saying
about Adelle in scene one?

30:34.933 --> 30:39.037
We ought to meet her at work,
telling her boss or her coworker

30:39.104 --> 30:41.440
some wild story about
why she was late this morning,

30:41.507 --> 30:43.675
which they all know can't be true.

30:43.742 --> 30:46.412
See, it's part of her charm,
these-these tales she weaves.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.079
So, when she uncovers the horrible truth

30:48.146 --> 30:50.382
about her neighbor
and tries to convince them all,

30:50.449 --> 30:51.717
no one believes her.

30:57.155 --> 30:58.690
A word of advice, boss?

30:58.757 --> 30:59.891
Sure.

30:59.958 --> 31:03.361
If you're afraid
of losing Stahr to Mayer,

31:03.429 --> 31:07.298
it might be wise to let him win a few.

31:07.365 --> 31:11.102
He was a son to you not long ago.

31:11.169 --> 31:12.904
You hate him.

31:12.971 --> 31:17.108
I also hate my dentist,
but I recognize his value.

31:17.175 --> 31:19.878
I just can't think of a win
I can give him

31:19.945 --> 31:22.080
that wouldn't feel like I was losing.

31:22.147 --> 31:24.916
Hmm, can't you?

31:27.018 --> 31:29.421
Very impressive place you have here.

31:29.488 --> 31:31.122
Golf club on the wall

31:31.189 --> 31:33.324
is from Bobby Jones.

31:33.391 --> 31:35.060
It's his mashie, his five-iron.

31:35.126 --> 31:37.496
Gave it to me just after
he won the Masters.

31:37.563 --> 31:40.599
Reminds me of Goebbel's office
in Berlin.

31:40.666 --> 31:43.735
Well, the inspiration was Mussolini.

31:43.802 --> 31:46.772
They have both banned films of mine.

31:46.838 --> 31:49.641
Ah.

31:49.708 --> 31:52.310
And now you want to work
with my little girl.

31:52.377 --> 31:54.112
Very exciting.
Daddy.

31:54.179 --> 31:57.449
An Enemy Among Us. Please.

31:57.516 --> 32:00.151
You like the title?

32:00.218 --> 32:01.887
Yeah, I like the whole script.

32:01.953 --> 32:05.457
The characters, scenarios...

32:05.524 --> 32:07.559
all very strong.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.761
And it has real thrills in it.

32:09.828 --> 32:12.931
Cliffhangers. Very American that way.

32:12.998 --> 32:15.501
It does not brood at all.
No.

32:15.567 --> 32:18.036
But it stings, bites.

32:18.103 --> 32:21.039
This character feels to me
like a female version

32:21.106 --> 32:22.774
of the Nietzschean Ubermensch...

32:24.710 --> 32:27.178
the answer to nihilism.

32:29.881 --> 32:32.217
Exactly.

32:35.754 --> 32:37.255
This one matters to us, Fritz.

32:37.322 --> 32:41.126
I feel it has a very
important statement to make

32:41.192 --> 32:43.028
to the world.

32:43.094 --> 32:46.765
I could not agree with you more, Pat.

32:46.832 --> 32:51.102
Well, then... welcome to Brady-American.

33:04.149 --> 33:06.417
Lovely meeting.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.153
One day, I look forward

33:08.219 --> 33:10.455
to introducing you to my actual father.

33:10.522 --> 33:13.592
I don't know who that was.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.762
I've never seen him so... agreeable.

33:16.828 --> 33:20.932
Perhaps I am just that charming.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.871
You know, now it's just the two of us,

33:25.937 --> 33:29.741
I did want to mention a concern
of mine about the script.

33:29.808 --> 33:32.343
Oh, I didn't know you had one.
I do.

33:32.410 --> 33:35.113
I didn't want to say anything
in front of him, but...

33:35.180 --> 33:37.382
it's missing something.

33:37.448 --> 33:39.851
Well, what's that?

33:41.219 --> 33:44.756
Everything Americans know nothing about.

33:44.823 --> 33:48.259
Passion. Sexuality. Terror.

33:48.326 --> 33:51.062
I see.

33:51.129 --> 33:53.865
The landlady that helps your spy,
Brigitta.

33:53.932 --> 33:56.868
Her entire motivation
should be between her legs.

33:56.935 --> 34:00.672
Sex is her North Star.

34:00.739 --> 34:04.275
Picture Marlene Dietrich.

34:04.342 --> 34:07.212
Brigitta's a supporting role.

34:07.278 --> 34:09.147
Dietrich only plays leads.

34:11.049 --> 34:14.052
She will play it if I ask her to.

34:14.119 --> 34:15.853
You know her?

34:15.920 --> 34:18.924
I'm staying in her home as her guest.

34:23.527 --> 34:25.295
Would you like to meet her?

34:32.871 --> 34:35.440
How does it make you feel?

34:35.505 --> 34:37.442
The idea of it?

34:37.507 --> 34:40.411
Excited.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.681
A little scared.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.216
You say that as if there's a difference.

34:45.283 --> 34:49.120
Every July, Americans set off skyrockets

34:49.187 --> 34:52.623
to celebrate how wonderful
it is to be free.

34:54.292 --> 34:57.796
Yet they know nothing of freedom.

34:59.765 --> 35:03.568
Freedom happens on my bed.

35:03.635 --> 35:07.372
And sometimes on my floor.

35:10.408 --> 35:12.744
Too strong?
No.

35:12.811 --> 35:15.013
It's wonderful.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.583
I live.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.418
I breathe.

35:20.485 --> 35:21.987
I fuck.

35:24.022 --> 35:25.691
And you?

35:27.592 --> 35:29.460
I live and breathe.

35:29.527 --> 35:31.863
Of course you do.

35:35.901 --> 35:37.869
Come with me.

36:02.794 --> 36:05.897
Marlene.

36:24.249 --> 36:26.484
Fritz Lang?
What's wrong with him?

36:26.551 --> 36:27.853
Do you have to ask?

36:27.919 --> 36:29.087
He's an enemy of the Reich,

36:29.154 --> 36:30.621
and he also happens to be Jewish.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.357
I heard he was raised Catholic.

36:32.423 --> 36:33.959
His mother was born Jewish.

36:34.025 --> 36:36.227
Keep this up, there's gonna be
nobody left making movies

36:36.294 --> 36:37.295
but Mickey Mouse.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.397
I don't know why I bother with you.

36:39.464 --> 36:42.000
I'm told Louis Mayer
makes all the decisions

36:42.067 --> 36:44.135
for the studio now.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.240
Funny story.

36:49.307 --> 36:51.109
I was a trolley operator when I was 14.

36:51.176 --> 36:55.213
My supervisor was a big tough guy,
maybe 30.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.749
Shook me down
for a few nickels every day.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.918
Got so bad, he started making me steal

36:59.985 --> 37:02.053
from the farebox.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.922
But...

37:03.989 --> 37:06.925
I put up with it...

37:06.992 --> 37:09.094
'cause I needed the job.

37:09.160 --> 37:13.298
And, well, he was taller than I was.

37:13.364 --> 37:18.303
Then, one summer, I had a growth spurt.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.873
Like that, I was taller than he was.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.241
So one day after work,

37:23.308 --> 37:25.777
I beat his brains in with a lead pipe.

37:25.844 --> 37:29.480
I fear I've missed your point.

37:29.547 --> 37:31.582
My point is, I put up with you

37:31.649 --> 37:35.020
for the same reason
the world puts up with Hitler.

37:35.086 --> 37:40.258
Because at this moment,
it's easier than going to war.

37:40.325 --> 37:44.462
But when that changes,
and it will change,

37:44.529 --> 37:48.333
you would do well to remember
I'm taller than you.

37:48.399 --> 37:51.769
And I'm never far from that lead pipe.

37:56.541 --> 37:58.776
Daddy,
I know what's missing from our movie.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.045
What movie?

38:00.111 --> 38:02.814
The only movie... An Enemy Among Us.

38:02.881 --> 38:05.583
It's too prudish, too puritanical.

38:05.650 --> 38:07.218
Nobody's lusting after anybody.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.354
Wait, did you just get in?

38:09.420 --> 38:11.622
Yes. Quite a night.

38:11.689 --> 38:13.424
With whom?
Fritz.

38:13.491 --> 38:15.726
He's such a perfect director for this.

38:15.793 --> 38:17.162
Monroe was so right about him.

38:17.228 --> 38:18.539
Yeah, Monroe doesn't know everything.

38:18.563 --> 38:19.998
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

38:20.065 --> 38:22.834
It means Fritz is a noted pervert.

38:22.901 --> 38:23.935
Did he...

38:24.002 --> 38:26.004
He didn't lay a finger on me.

38:26.071 --> 38:27.873
And where am I gonna learn things

38:27.939 --> 38:29.707
if not out in the world?

38:29.774 --> 38:31.509
In here?
I don't know.

38:31.576 --> 38:34.179
I don't think we did so badly by you,
darling.

38:34.245 --> 38:35.923
Thought you were learning
plenty at Bennington.

38:35.947 --> 38:38.016
Oh, everyone at Bennington's an idiot.

38:40.218 --> 38:41.853
Mother?

38:41.920 --> 38:45.023
Help me. You know I'm right.

38:45.090 --> 38:48.894
You only get one father, Celia.

38:50.962 --> 38:54.132
The Langs of the world will come and go.

38:54.199 --> 38:56.334
And so will Monroe.

38:57.969 --> 38:59.570
You don't understand.

39:02.773 --> 39:05.610
And it's not the only movie!

39:08.113 --> 39:10.381
Here's what you can expect from him.

39:10.448 --> 39:12.817
Me daughter tells me you're in politics.

39:12.884 --> 39:14.585
To which you would say...

39:14.652 --> 39:16.721
In a fashion, if you like.

39:16.787 --> 39:17.956
I don't.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.624
Don't trust politicians.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.326
Especially rich ones.

39:21.392 --> 39:22.660
You rich?

39:22.727 --> 39:23.929
Sadly, yes.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.330
How rich?

39:25.396 --> 39:27.032
Quite, I'm afraid.

39:27.098 --> 39:29.700
And ya think I'd hand you
a daughter of mine?

39:29.767 --> 39:31.736
I've only got the five of them.

39:31.802 --> 39:34.839
My word, Brigid,
is he really going to be this rough?

39:34.906 --> 39:36.274
If he's sober.

39:38.977 --> 39:41.112
That's the one. Thank you.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.787
See? A born actress.

39:49.854 --> 39:51.622
Oh, God. I hope not.

39:55.560 --> 39:56.928
Thank you.

39:56.995 --> 40:00.331
For what?

40:00.398 --> 40:03.634
For being you.

40:03.701 --> 40:05.336
See you tonight?

40:24.455 --> 40:27.058
Oh, come on. I'm hardly a model.

40:27.125 --> 40:29.260
Didn't get your eyes right.

40:29.327 --> 40:31.496
They're so beautiful.

40:32.763 --> 40:36.434
There isn't anyone
I can contact for you?

40:36.501 --> 40:38.269
An aunt, an uncle?

40:38.336 --> 40:41.272
I told you, they all scattered.

40:41.339 --> 40:43.608
It was never a close family, anyway.

40:43.674 --> 40:46.077
Now, could you just please be still?

40:46.144 --> 40:49.214
I feel silly.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.752
That's better.

40:54.819 --> 40:56.454
See?

40:58.023 --> 40:59.824
It almost does you justice.

40:59.890 --> 41:02.693
You can draw.

41:04.795 --> 41:07.832
It does help when I'm inspired.

41:07.898 --> 41:10.468
Is it operable?

41:13.771 --> 41:15.606
They hope so.

41:15.673 --> 41:18.676
Glad you could make it.

41:22.780 --> 41:25.350
So?

41:25.416 --> 41:27.452
Funny.

41:27.518 --> 41:29.287
I always wondered
why the pages he turned in

41:29.354 --> 41:31.156
first thing in the morning
were so much better

41:31.222 --> 41:34.159
than his pages at the end of the day.

41:34.225 --> 41:36.127
Was all of it you?

41:37.862 --> 41:40.365
No. Monroe, I...

41:40.431 --> 41:45.036
He might bounce an idea off me,
or talk through a scenario,

41:45.103 --> 41:46.604
if he was stuck.
Bernadette,

41:46.671 --> 41:50.308
he did show me an early draft of this...
a year ago.

41:52.410 --> 41:55.180
It wasn't nearly this good.

41:55.246 --> 41:56.447
And he knew it.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.850
He couldn't get the women right.

41:59.917 --> 42:01.652
But you did.

42:01.719 --> 42:05.623
You fixed the subplot, too,
which was a real mess.

42:05.690 --> 42:08.459
I'm ashamed I didn't catch on sooner.

42:10.161 --> 42:11.929
You're very talented.

42:11.996 --> 42:13.631
You hear me?

42:13.698 --> 42:15.733
You can write.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.203
Not many can.

42:18.269 --> 42:20.371
Why don't you try it full-time?

42:20.438 --> 42:24.709
It's got to be easier than
chasing fourth-graders around.

42:24.775 --> 42:26.311
I didn't... I wanted... I just wanted

42:26.377 --> 42:28.579
to see his name on a screen again.

42:28.646 --> 42:30.815
Credits are nice.

42:30.881 --> 42:32.617
Family is better.

42:32.683 --> 42:35.686
And I have a picture
that needs some help.

42:35.753 --> 42:37.588
It's Pat's baby.

42:39.690 --> 42:41.726
Please.

42:43.394 --> 42:46.531
He doesn't make any secret phone calls?

42:46.597 --> 42:49.667
No.

42:49.734 --> 42:52.103
Any private meetings off the lot?

42:52.170 --> 42:53.738
No. No, sir.

42:53.804 --> 42:57.442
Do you have anything to report?

42:57.508 --> 42:59.810
Near as I can tell, Mr. Brady,

42:59.877 --> 43:03.148
all he does all day
is try and make you money.

43:04.682 --> 43:08.819
Miner, you may be the worst
office boy I ever hired.

43:11.256 --> 43:13.090
It's 4:00, Mr. Brady.

43:13.158 --> 43:16.093
The celebration
for Mr. Stahr's birthday.

43:16.161 --> 43:17.928
You wanted me to remind you.

43:17.995 --> 43:19.664
Thank you, Birdy.

43:19.730 --> 43:21.866
Uh, stick around for a minute, will you?

43:21.932 --> 43:23.100
That'll be all, Miner.

43:23.168 --> 43:25.303
Yes, sir.

43:27.738 --> 43:29.640
Birdy.

43:29.707 --> 43:32.677
Do you think the Sally Sweet
script is lousy?

43:34.579 --> 43:37.014
I really couldn't say, Mr. Brady.

43:37.081 --> 43:38.616
Haven't read that one yet.

43:38.683 --> 43:41.486
I did love The Wizard of Oz.

43:41.552 --> 43:43.654
Mr. Mayer sent it to Mr. Stahr.

43:43.721 --> 43:47.858
It has Munchkins, an Emerald City.

43:47.925 --> 43:49.794
You really should read it.

44:10.915 --> 44:12.049
Cut it, cut it.

44:16.721 --> 44:18.789
That was better.

44:18.856 --> 44:20.525
Better. It's just, uh...

44:20.591 --> 44:22.693
Still, it's still missing something.

44:22.760 --> 44:24.462
What's that, Monroe?

44:26.030 --> 44:27.565
Joy.

44:27.632 --> 44:30.301
Joy. The picture's about kindness.

44:30.368 --> 44:33.338
How it saves one man, then one family,

44:33.404 --> 44:36.574
then a whole neighborhood,
and maybe the world.

44:38.676 --> 44:40.911
Pretend you're singing to your kid,

44:40.978 --> 44:44.982
or your little brother,
or the widow next door.

44:45.049 --> 44:47.252
All right, let's try that.

45:49.113 --> 45:50.748
Thank you.

45:53.484 --> 45:55.052
It's going great, Pat.

45:55.119 --> 45:58.022
Dell tells me you're on take 20.

45:58.088 --> 45:59.857
That is art for art's sake.

46:01.158 --> 46:04.795
Still wearing that watch, I see.

46:04.862 --> 46:06.664
I have to know what time it is, don't I?

46:06.731 --> 46:08.809
Maybe you should give it to my
daughter so she'll know not to

46:08.833 --> 46:11.936
stay out all night with that
German pervert you sold her on.

46:13.871 --> 46:17.207
You are gonna get off my back
at some point, aren't you?

46:17.274 --> 46:20.811
You need to understand something:
all this is mine.

46:20.878 --> 46:23.848
You... are all mine.

46:25.316 --> 46:27.585
And he who eats my bread sings my song.

46:27.652 --> 46:29.920
What are you talking about?
I am sick

46:29.987 --> 46:32.256
of waiting for Mayer
to lure you away already!

46:33.324 --> 46:36.794
Hi! Happy birthday, Monroe!

46:38.128 --> 46:39.930
Uh, I...

46:39.997 --> 46:42.700
I appreciate you not singing
"Happy Birthday."

46:42.767 --> 46:44.234
I've always hated that song.

46:45.736 --> 46:49.239
And, uh, I'm grateful. I'm grateful.

46:52.710 --> 46:53.844
Don't, don't.

47:09.760 --> 47:12.497
Get lost.

47:14.198 --> 47:17.334
You know what "Angels on the Avenue"
is about for me, Monroe?

47:17.402 --> 47:18.869
Loyalty.

47:18.936 --> 47:20.736
Yeah, Carter's down,
but Bell sticks with him.

47:20.771 --> 47:22.172
Doesn't jump ship just 'cause things

47:22.239 --> 47:24.509
have gotten a little rocky.

47:24.575 --> 47:26.444
He hangs in.

47:26.511 --> 47:28.646
Like a friend.

47:28.713 --> 47:32.517
That's what it's about for me, too, Pat.

47:35.386 --> 47:37.321
Good.

47:37.388 --> 47:39.857
Did you put a new writer on Sally Sweet?

47:39.924 --> 47:42.960
Or were you too busy
pondering TheWizard of Oz?

47:45.062 --> 47:46.664
I just hired one.

47:46.731 --> 47:48.699
And you're gonna love her.

47:51.869 --> 47:55.039
Then... here.

47:55.105 --> 47:56.941
What is it?

47:57.007 --> 47:58.509
Open it.

48:06.183 --> 48:08.719
Happy birthday, son.

49:01.472 --> 49:04.308
I always knew it would happen.

49:04.374 --> 49:07.545
My favorite waitress in the pictures.

49:09.313 --> 49:11.816
You shouldn't be here.
It's the funniest thing.

49:11.882 --> 49:16.754
The guard at gate six can be
bribed with a ham sandwich.

49:18.188 --> 49:21.191
Say, uh,
what do they pay for voice-over work?

49:21.258 --> 49:23.594
Is it good money?

49:23.661 --> 49:26.363
Well,
it hardly matters; you're in the movies.

49:26.430 --> 49:28.799
Bringing Minna Davis back to life.

49:28.866 --> 49:30.100
My, my.

49:30.167 --> 49:32.436
So I guess this means
I won't be seeing you

49:32.503 --> 49:34.071
at the restaurant anymore.

49:34.138 --> 49:35.840
Shame.

49:35.906 --> 49:39.510
That place had
a really fine turtle soup.

49:41.411 --> 49:43.347
No.

49:43.413 --> 49:45.015
No more restaurant.

49:45.082 --> 49:46.884
Good night, Mr. Szep.

49:46.951 --> 49:51.221
I'm happy for you, Kathleen.
You always did belong on a lot.

49:51.288 --> 49:53.658
Take care, now.

49:53.724 --> 49:55.860
I'll see you real soon.
