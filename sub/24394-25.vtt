one of the things

28:24.667 --> 28:26.208

with The Movement?

28:26.291 --> 28:27.709
The initial idea was,
eventually,

28:27.792 --> 28:29.792
that Trump would bring
his official support,

28:29.875 --> 28:32.834
and ultimately, I hope,
he'll be part of it.

28:32.917 --> 28:35.834
-He himself?
-Yeah. Why not?

28:35.917 --> 28:38.500
For every populist leader,
it's not easy.

28:38.583 --> 28:40.875
At a certain stage, you say,
"We have to do it."

Certainly, Mr. Salvini

28:44.959 --> 28:47.041
has become an icon
all over the world

28:47.125 --> 28:48.959
because of action.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.041
And he just proved
with his action,

28:52.125 --> 28:54.834
closing the harbors,
that it was possible...

28:54.917 --> 28:57.041

28:57.125 --> 28:59.458
of Europe by the migrants.

28:59.542 --> 29:00.625
So, it's action.

29:00.709 --> 29:02.542
Same with Orbán.

29:02.625 --> 29:04.750
He closed also the borders,

29:04.834 --> 29:07.709
also from these migrations,

29:07.792 --> 29:12.208
and also he's fighting
for the Christian values.

29:12.291 --> 29:14.458
And so, I think it is, indeed,

29:14.542 --> 29:16.959

29:17.041 --> 29:18.917
