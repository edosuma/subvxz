00:04.212 --> 00:07.965
It's so weird. How did Joey
end up kissing Charlie last night?

00:08.132 --> 00:12.302
- I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
- I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too.

00:12.470 --> 00:14.304
But surprise!

00:15.557 --> 00:18.017
I missed most of the party.

00:18.184 --> 00:19.601
Charlie's a girl, right?

00:20.729 --> 00:25.149
Yeah, she's this new professor
in my department that I did not kiss.

00:25.692 --> 00:30.070
I don't know why Joey had to kiss her.
Of all the girls at the party, God!

00:31.406 --> 00:35.534
- Why do you care so much?
- Yes, Rachel. Why do you care so much?

00:38.663 --> 00:43.500
Because Ross is the father of my child.

00:43.668 --> 00:47.880
You know, and I want him
to hook up with lots of women.

00:48.298 --> 00:53.177
All I'm saying is, I don't think that Joey
and Charlie have anything in common.

00:53.344 --> 00:57.514
I don't know. They seemed to have
a shared interest in each other's tonsils.

00:57.974 --> 01:02.394
Wow. Joey and a professor.
Can you imagine if they had kids?

01:02.562 --> 01:05.022
And if the kids got her intelligence...

01:05.190 --> 01:08.192
...and Joey's raw sexual magnetism...

01:08.359 --> 01:10.778
...those nerds would get laid!

01:12.655 --> 01:16.075
All right. So, Ross, you're
okay with all this? I mean...

01:16.242 --> 01:19.328
It's no big deal.
I just met her. I'm fine with it.

01:21.873 --> 01:25.042
God, I forgot how hot she was.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.045
- I'm gonna get some more coffee.
- Hi.

01:28.213 --> 01:31.173
- Oh, you know, I'll come with you.
- Okay.

01:32.217 --> 01:36.637
- So a professor, huh?
- Yeah. She is cool. And she's so smart.

01:36.805 --> 01:39.681
Her mind is totally acrimonious.

01:45.188 --> 01:47.898
Guess that's not how she used it.

01:49.818 --> 01:52.319
I feel like I owe you an explanation.

01:52.487 --> 01:56.490
I don't ordinarily go around
kissing guys at parties.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.117
I'm...

01:58.660 --> 02:02.704
Well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really
hope you don't think less of me.

02:02.872 --> 02:05.415
Think less of you? No.
I don't think less of you.

02:05.583 --> 02:08.418
I mean, you saw someone you liked
and you kissed them.

02:08.586 --> 02:11.964
Those people who like someone
and don't kiss them...

02:12.132 --> 02:15.968
...those people are stupid.
I hate those people.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.470
Actually, I'm a little surprised
at myself.

02:18.638 --> 02:21.849
I mean, Joey's so different
from the guys I usually date.

02:22.016 --> 02:25.185
They're all professors, intellectuals.
Paleontologists mostly.

02:25.353 --> 02:28.313
- You know, very cerebral...
- Yeah, I know the type.

02:28.731 --> 02:33.152
If we want to grab a bite before work,
we'd better get acrimonious.

02:35.446 --> 02:38.407
No?
Am I getting close?

03:31.377 --> 03:32.419
- Hey!
- Hi.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.047
Hey, you guys.
Look what I just got.

03:36.382 --> 03:39.593
Oh, wow! I love those!
Where did you get them?

03:39.761 --> 03:44.681
I bought them off eBay. They used
to belong to the late Shania Twain.

03:47.685 --> 03:50.103
Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.898
Oh, then I overpaid.

03:55.652 --> 03:56.860
Hey, what's this?

03:57.028 --> 04:00.155
Oh, it's a gift certificate
to this new spa in SoHo.

04:00.323 --> 04:04.159
You can't show Phoebe this. She hates
those corporate massage chains.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.870
What, now I can't get a massage?

04:07.038 --> 04:10.415
There are so many things
that she disapproves of.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.710
I can't eat veal. I can't wear fur.

04:13.878 --> 04:16.296
I can't go hunting.

04:17.298 --> 04:20.759
- Do you want to go hunting?
- I would like to have the option.

04:22.845 --> 04:25.555
- What's that? Hey, Rachel?
- Ah...

04:25.723 --> 04:27.516
No, you can't go there!

04:27.684 --> 04:30.310
You know how I feel about
these big massage places.

04:30.478 --> 04:32.938
They're putting people like me
out of business.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.399
She wants to go hunting too!

04:39.028 --> 04:41.154
Phoebe, come on,
I don't want to waste it.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.532
It would be like throwing
away 100 bucks.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.702
Okay, this is not about
the money. Okay?

04:46.869 --> 04:50.080
It's about corporate greed
destroying our hearts...

04:50.248 --> 04:53.417
...and leaving us hollow shells.

04:54.752 --> 04:57.379
I don't care about any of that.

04:59.424 --> 05:04.052
Well, do you care about friendship?
I feel really strongly about this.

05:04.262 --> 05:07.973
Please don't use this gift certificate.
I'm asking you as a friend.

05:08.182 --> 05:12.227
Oh, not as a friend. Phoebe!

05:13.104 --> 05:14.396
Fine. I won't use it.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.523
- Promise?
- I promise.

05:16.691 --> 05:20.277
- Thank you.
- Well, I am going hunting.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.535
Hey, honey. I missed you today.

05:28.703 --> 05:31.204
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Hey.

05:31.956 --> 05:36.793
- What do you wanna do tonight?
- Oh, well, maybe we could, uh...

05:46.429 --> 05:49.931
Okay, trying to turn me on
by making a mess?

05:50.099 --> 05:51.683
Know your audience.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.646
Besides, tomorrow we're doing
those fertility tests.

05:56.814 --> 05:59.816
Until then, you need to keep
your tadpoles in the tank.

06:01.277 --> 06:03.403
Do we really need to take those tests?

06:03.571 --> 06:05.655
We've been trying
to have a baby for a year.

06:05.823 --> 06:08.742
I think it's a good idea
to find out if everything's okay.

06:08.910 --> 06:12.954
- Just a few routine tests.
- But I don't want to do it in a cup.

06:13.539 --> 06:17.626
- What is the big deal?
- It's weird! You're in a doctor's office.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.128
It's not okay to do it
in a doctor's office...

06:20.296 --> 06:23.715
...but it is okay to do it in
a parked car behind a Taco Bell?

06:26.594 --> 06:30.222
I cannot believe Ross told you that.

06:30.807 --> 06:34.768
And in my defense, it was a Wendy's.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.687
Look, I don't want to do
these tests either.

06:37.855 --> 06:40.190
But I really do think
it's a good idea.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.734
I'm sure a doctor's office
can't be worse...

06:42.902 --> 06:46.154
...than on a class trip
to the Hershey factory.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.157
Oh, yeah! Rachel talks too!

06:56.290 --> 06:59.626
Who says wine has to cost
more than milk?

07:05.550 --> 07:06.591
- Hey!
- Hi.

07:06.801 --> 07:09.010
- Come on in. How are you?
- I'm good.

07:09.178 --> 07:11.888
- Can I offer you a drink?
- Please.

07:12.056 --> 07:14.349
I have been crazed all day.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.644
I had a meeting with the dean,
my syllabus for summer school's due...

07:17.812 --> 07:19.938
...and I'm writing the foreword
for a book.

07:20.106 --> 07:23.358
I had a pretty hectic day at work too.
Today I had to open a door and go:

07:27.113 --> 07:29.072
So I am just so excited to be here.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.492
- I can't wait to explore the city.
- If you need a tour guide...

07:32.660 --> 07:35.078
Oh, you mean it?
That would be so fun.

07:35.246 --> 07:39.291
Oh, yeah, definitely. Definitely. Okay.
What do you want to see first?

07:39.459 --> 07:43.628
We could go see the Kronos Quartet
at Avery Fisher Hall.

07:47.216 --> 07:48.467
Okay.

07:48.634 --> 07:52.637
There's a collection of Walt Whitman
letters on display at the public library.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.764
I know.

07:56.184 --> 08:00.437
- But first, I have to see the Met.
- Okay, let me stop you right there.

08:00.605 --> 08:03.565
The Mets suck, okay?

08:05.485 --> 08:07.903
You wanna see the Yankees.

08:08.070 --> 08:10.780
No. No, not the Mets.
The Met. Singular.

08:10.948 --> 08:13.366
Which one? They all suck.

08:14.118 --> 08:15.702
The museum.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.498
I don't think so.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.632
- Hi there.
- Hello. Welcome to Lavender Day Spa.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.675
How may I help you?

08:31.511 --> 08:35.304
Hi. I have a massage appointment
under Rachel Green.

08:35.472 --> 08:40.268
- Okay.
- And here is my gift certificate.

08:41.812 --> 08:46.691
- This has been torn up.
- And taped back together.

08:47.944 --> 08:51.446
Okay. Well, I'll call you as soon
as your massage therapist is ready.

08:51.614 --> 08:54.199
- Okay.
- Have a seat through the glass doors.

08:54.617 --> 08:58.620
- Through the glass doors.
- Through the glass doors.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.206
Alrighty then.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.758
Phoebe, your next client's
in the waiting room.

09:11.926 --> 09:15.345
Do we have to talk like that
when they're not around?

09:17.306 --> 09:20.141
Oh, no. No, no.

09:20.768 --> 09:24.354
Listen, is there someone
who can fill in for me?

09:24.564 --> 09:27.899
- Sorry. Everyone is booked.
- That woman can't know I work here.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.610
She's a friend of mine
and I made this big stink...

09:30.778 --> 09:32.904
...about how awful
these massage chains are.

09:33.072 --> 09:36.700
- Then why do you work here?
- Because it's good money.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.868
But that doesn't change the fact...

09:39.036 --> 09:42.247
...that this is an evil, bloodsucking
corporate machine.

09:42.832 --> 09:46.001
Well, I think this is a great place
to work.

09:47.753 --> 09:50.505
Okay, are they listening?

09:54.302 --> 09:55.927
- Ross. Hey.
- Hi.

09:56.095 --> 09:59.222
I need to talk to you about Charlie.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.891
Oh, do you? Do you really?

10:02.393 --> 10:04.853
Yeah, I'm kind of having
a little problem.

10:05.187 --> 10:10.025
Look, if you don't know what the word
"acrimonious" means, just don't use it.

10:10.901 --> 10:12.569
Look, you know Charlie, right?

10:12.737 --> 10:16.698
- She's cool, funny, her body is so...
- Get to the problem.

10:16.866 --> 10:21.328
Right. She's just so much smarter
than all the girls I've ever dated.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.413
Combined.

10:23.581 --> 10:28.460
You know? And I just...
I don't want her to think I'm stupid.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.882
Are you wearing two belts?

10:35.426 --> 10:37.761
Hey, what do you know?

10:42.308 --> 10:44.684
You were saying you didn't want
to seem stupid.

10:44.852 --> 10:49.189
Well, she wants to go
to all these cultural places...

10:49.357 --> 10:53.610
...and I don't know how to talk about
that stuff. You gotta help me out.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.738
I don't want to get involved
in your guys' relationship.

10:56.906 --> 11:00.033
Oh, dude, please. Come on,
you're the smartest person I know.

11:00.201 --> 11:04.329
And I really like this girl, okay?
I don't want to lose her.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.042
- Fine.
- Thanks.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.044
Okay. Let's see.

11:11.212 --> 11:15.048
- Oh, you should take her to the Met.
- The Mets.

11:16.217 --> 11:20.220
No, no, no. The Met.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.182
Oh, that's what she meant.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.852
If they're gonna shorten it, they
should call it the "Muse," you know?

11:28.020 --> 11:30.772
Short for "museum"
and avoid all the confusion.

11:32.108 --> 11:37.987
Yeah, most days the place is packed
with confused, angry baseball fans.

11:38.155 --> 11:41.032
Okay. All right,
so I'll take her to the Met.

11:41.200 --> 11:47.163
Yeah. Okay. There's this great
rare bookstore on Madison Avenue.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.791
You know what?
She loves architecture.

11:49.959 --> 11:53.545
You should take a walk down Fifth
to the St. Patrick's Cathedral.

11:53.713 --> 11:57.424
And there, there's this great
little pastry shop that she'd love.

11:57.591 --> 12:00.218
Jeez. Sounds like you
should be going on this date.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.554
But I'm not.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.266
- And you know what...?
- Okay, slow down.

12:06.434 --> 12:07.892
You're going way too fast. Okay?

12:08.060 --> 12:09.728
- Just go back to the Met.
- Okay.

12:09.895 --> 12:12.605
So you gotta tell me exactly
what to do there.

12:12.773 --> 12:15.275
When you walk into the museum,
take a right, okay?

12:15.443 --> 12:17.026
That's the antiquities wing.

12:17.194 --> 12:20.488
Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia,
up to the Byzantine Empire.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.574
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:23.451 --> 12:27.287
Okay. So I walk in the door
and make a right.

12:40.259 --> 12:43.261
I have a weird feeling about
this place. How do I know...

12:43.429 --> 12:47.474
...they won't secretly videotape me
and put it all over the Internet?

12:48.893 --> 12:53.062
Because, honey, and I mean this
in the sweetest way possible...

12:53.230 --> 12:55.690
...nobody's gonna wanna watch that.

12:57.234 --> 12:58.985
Mr. Bing? Here you are.

12:59.153 --> 13:02.155
Go into that room and deposit
your specimen into the container.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.782
Deposit my specimen?

13:03.949 --> 13:07.494
I usually have to call a 900 number
for that kind of talk.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.625
Thanks. Got it.

13:14.376 --> 13:16.711
All right. Honey, my tests
are down the hall.

13:16.879 --> 13:20.089
- Are you sure you're gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

13:20.257 --> 13:23.134
Look, I know this is embarrassing,
but nobody cares.

13:23.302 --> 13:26.095
No one here even knows you.

13:27.515 --> 13:31.518
Oh, my God!

13:34.772 --> 13:36.022
Oh, come on!

13:45.449 --> 13:47.659
How great is this?

13:47.868 --> 13:50.829
We're probably fertile.
Let's go home.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.083
Why are you here?

13:55.251 --> 13:58.545
Sid and I are trying again
and we had trouble last time...

13:58.712 --> 14:02.549
No, no, no. I mean, why?
Why is she here?

14:02.925 --> 14:07.428
Oh, someone's a little cranky today
because they have to do it in a cup. Ha, ha, ha.

14:07.596 --> 14:10.181
Oh, they gave you the kiddie size.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.936
What?

14:17.731 --> 14:22.235
This was fun. But I've got
an invasive vaginal exam to get to.

14:23.696 --> 14:27.323
I'd love to stay
but I've got a hot date.

14:27.491 --> 14:31.578
Please go. Just let me know
if you need a hand. Ha, ha, ha.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.586
I think it just fell off.

14:45.092 --> 14:47.218
Hello, ja.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.598
It's time for your massage, ja?

14:51.765 --> 14:53.850
Put your face in the hole.

14:56.395 --> 14:59.731
A Swedish massage
from a real Swedish person.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.650
Okay, then I'm Swedish.

15:04.778 --> 15:07.155
So, what's your name?

15:07.323 --> 15:10.116
It's a normal Swedish name.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.951
Ikea.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.789
- Wow. What an interesting name.
- Yeah.

15:16.957 --> 15:18.917
- You know, I...
- Time for your scalp massage.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.168
Oh.

15:22.129 --> 15:24.589
Wow. I really love your...

15:27.259 --> 15:31.095
- Is something wrong?
- No, it's just, um...

15:31.263 --> 15:33.348
It just feels so good...

15:33.515 --> 15:35.308
...lkea.

15:36.352 --> 15:39.604
Hey, say, you'll know this.
What's the capital of Sweden?

15:40.439 --> 15:41.814
Um...

15:41.982 --> 15:43.441
Stockholm.

15:43.859 --> 15:46.486
Damn. I wish I knew
if that was right.

15:48.530 --> 15:52.492
Note the painterly lines
and subtle impasto on this canvas.

15:52.868 --> 15:55.411
Monet painted quickly,
and usually outdoors...

15:55.579 --> 15:59.749
...as his elusive subject
was light itself.

16:01.669 --> 16:05.213
Now, do you have any idea
what you just said?

16:08.175 --> 16:12.303
No, no. My mouth says the words,
my brain is thinking "monster trucks."

16:14.723 --> 16:16.849
Now, remember,
when you get to the museum...

16:17.017 --> 16:21.020
...Monet is not spelled M-O-N-A-Y.
I just...

16:21.188 --> 16:25.733
- I wrote that out phonetically for you.
- Phonetically?

16:26.610 --> 16:30.029
Yeah, that means...
We just don't have time for this.

16:30.197 --> 16:34.909
I gotta say, I'm really impressed you
were able to memorize all this so quickly.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.662
I'm an actor.
I can memorize anything.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.455
Last week on Days, I had to say:

16:39.623 --> 16:41.958
"Frontal temporal
zygomatic craniotomy."

16:42.126 --> 16:46.087
- Wow. What does that mean?
- No idea.

16:46.255 --> 16:49.632
But the guy I said it to
dies in the next scene...

16:49.800 --> 16:52.719
...so I guess it means,
"You'll get eaten by a bear."

16:56.640 --> 16:58.182
Okay.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.978
- So let's move on to the Renaissance.
- Okay.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.481
Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here...

17:05.648 --> 17:08.734
...to highlight the anguish
of the central figure.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.611
Touch it. It's really bumpy.

17:10.779 --> 17:16.701
Nuh-uh. Uh-uh. No, no, no. No ad-libbing.
And, dude, you can't touch the paintings.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.118
- Come on.
- No. No!

17:29.256 --> 17:31.299
My specimen's in the room.

17:31.467 --> 17:35.720
I just want to thank whoever knocked
on the door while I was in there.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.014
Really helped speed the process along.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.728
Janice, you're not gone?

17:44.938 --> 17:46.230
Sid is still in his room.

17:46.398 --> 17:50.777
I don't allow porn at home,
so this is like a vacation for him.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.989
So did you do it?
Did you make your deposit?

17:55.157 --> 17:59.452
- Yeah. The hard part's over.
- That's not the hard part, honey.

17:59.620 --> 18:04.165
The hard part's what comes next.
Aren't you worried about the results?

18:04.374 --> 18:06.834
I haven't even thought
about the results.

18:07.002 --> 18:09.337
I just assumed everything
would be okay.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.798
Well, you know what? It probably is.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.549
But what if it's not okay?

18:13.717 --> 18:16.928
I mean, what if there's a reason
we can't have a baby?

18:17.096 --> 18:20.431
Chandler. Look, you and Monica
are meant to have children.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.642
I'm sure it's gonna be just fine.

18:24.269 --> 18:29.565
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. I can't
believe I didn't even think of that.

18:29.733 --> 18:34.320
I guess I was so worried about
having to come here and do that.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.823
You can do it
in a Taco Bell parking lot...

18:36.990 --> 18:39.492
...but you can't do it
at a doctor's office?

18:41.829 --> 18:44.122
It was a Wendy's!

18:53.799 --> 18:58.594
And that's the Swedish national anthem.
Thank you for asking.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.140
Wow, lkea.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.184
What a rich culture.

19:05.352 --> 19:08.146
You know what?
I have a friend who's a masseuse.

19:08.313 --> 19:12.024
- Oh? Ja, ja?
- Ja. She's not very good, though.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.904
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

19:17.406 --> 19:20.950
- And why do you think that is?
- I don't know.

19:21.118 --> 19:24.328
Maybe it's because she's got
such callousy fingers...

19:24.496 --> 19:27.165
...from playing crummy guitar.

19:34.965 --> 19:38.759
Or maybe she has trouble
loosening your knots...

19:38.927 --> 19:42.388
...because you're such
a high-maintenance tight-ass.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.348
- Phoebe!
- You know it's me?

19:44.516 --> 19:46.767
Well, for like a half an hour!

19:46.935 --> 19:49.770
Man, you can lie about Sweden!

19:51.356 --> 19:52.982
How can you come here?

19:53.150 --> 19:56.694
- Why didn't you tell me you work here?
- I don't have to tell you everything!

19:56.862 --> 20:00.364
You do if you're gonna make me feel
guilty for getting a free massage.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.783
- Tip's not included.
- Oh!

20:04.286 --> 20:06.621
Why did you lie to me
about working here?

20:06.788 --> 20:11.083
Because I was ashamed, okay?
I sold out for the cash.

20:11.251 --> 20:16.505
And they give me benefits, like medical
and dental and a four-oh-wunk.

20:21.803 --> 20:26.682
But, you know, you pay a price.
Now I'm this corporate stooge...

20:26.850 --> 20:29.143
...and punching a clock...

20:29.311 --> 20:31.187
...and paying taxes!

20:32.064 --> 20:34.982
Phoebe, honey,
if you hate it so much...

20:35.150 --> 20:38.903
...you should walk out there
right now and quit.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.697
Be true to what you believe in.

20:41.865 --> 20:45.493
Honey, you have principles,
and I so admire that.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.870
I don't have any.

20:49.623 --> 20:52.625
You know what? You're right.
I am gonna quit.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.878
- It's time I took my life back.
- Good for you, Pheebs.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.380
Okay.

20:59.800 --> 21:04.637
If you guys have microphones in
there too, I didn't mean any of that.

21:05.305 --> 21:07.181
I love you.

21:08.809 --> 21:13.688
Aha! Got you! Die! Die! Die!

21:15.440 --> 21:22.154
- Respectfully, Professor R. Geller. Hey.
- Hi.

21:22.322 --> 21:24.240
- Hey, how was the Met?
- Oh!

21:24.408 --> 21:26.492
- The museum was amazing.
- Yeah?

21:26.660 --> 21:29.036
Yeah, Joey really knows his art, huh?

21:29.204 --> 21:31.372
Not so much, no.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.250
He had clearly memorized
all this stuff to say...

21:34.418 --> 21:37.169
...and some of it didn't
even make any sense.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.714
- What do you mean?
- Well, for one...

21:39.881 --> 21:42.842
...he was talking about paintings
that were nowhere around.

21:45.637 --> 21:50.182
Wait a minute. When you guys walked
into the Met, did you go to the right?

21:50.350 --> 21:54.312
- No. No, we went to the left.
- Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey.

21:56.648 --> 22:00.234
Still, it seems like you guys
are having a great time together.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.738
Yeah. Yeah, it's fun.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.033
What?

22:08.827 --> 22:10.703
Actually, Joey's your friend...

22:10.871 --> 22:13.497
...and you don't know me that well.
It'd be weird.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.542
Well, I mean, a little.
But no, what? Go on.

22:16.710 --> 22:17.752
Well...

22:18.879 --> 22:22.506
I'm thinking that maybe Joey
isn't the right guy for me right now.

22:22.674 --> 22:25.885
You know, maybe I should
be with someone...

22:27.929 --> 22:31.682
...I have more in common with.
You know what I mean?

22:33.018 --> 22:34.602
Yeah.

22:37.105 --> 22:39.607
Yeah, but you know what?

22:40.734 --> 22:43.778
I think you should give Joey a chance.

22:43.945 --> 22:45.780
I mean, he's a great guy.

22:45.947 --> 22:48.532
And sure, he doesn't know
that much about art...

22:48.700 --> 22:51.410
...but you can always talk about
that with someone else.

22:51.578 --> 22:53.829
- I guess that's true.
- If you think about it...

22:54.039 --> 22:58.167
...he memorized all that stuff because
he thought it was important to you.

22:58.335 --> 23:01.045
You know, that's the kind of guy
Joey is.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.756
He is very sweet.

23:03.924 --> 23:05.591
Plus, he is hot!

23:06.927 --> 23:10.429
That was gonna be my next argument.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.598
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.850
- You ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.

23:15.018 --> 23:16.060
Wow.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.980
- Thanks, Ross.
- Yeah.

23:21.149 --> 23:24.777
Hey, Ross. That art stuff worked.
You hooked me up.

23:26.571 --> 23:27.863
Glad I could help, man.

23:28.073 --> 23:32.118
Some of the stuff wasn't where you said
it would be, but I made it work.

23:42.421 --> 23:46.632
It is not okay that I'm aroused
by this now.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.303
Hello?

23:51.805 --> 23:54.765
Oh. Hi, Dr. Connelly.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.518
No. Well, she's not here...

23:57.686 --> 23:59.228
...but I can tell her.

23:59.396 --> 24:02.148
Should I be sitting down for this?

24:06.736 --> 24:08.279
Oh.

24:10.240 --> 24:15.202
Uh-huh.

24:17.456 --> 24:20.040
Well, so, what does that mean?

24:24.921 --> 24:27.298
Okay. Okay, thank you.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.091
Thanks.

24:35.390 --> 24:36.849
Hey, sweetie.

24:37.767 --> 24:39.268
Dr. Connelly just called.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.770
With good news?
Of course it's not good news.

24:41.938 --> 24:43.772
You said, "Dr. Connelly just called."

24:43.940 --> 24:46.984
If it was good, you'd have said,
"Dr. Connelly just called!"

24:47.152 --> 24:49.320
So, what is it? Is it?

24:49.488 --> 24:53.532
Is there a problem? Is there
a problem with me, or with you?

24:55.285 --> 24:57.495
Actually, it's both of us.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.414
What?

25:00.582 --> 25:03.751
Apparently, my sperm
have low motility...

25:03.919 --> 25:08.797
...and you have
an inhospitable environment.

25:12.802 --> 25:14.470
Oh.

25:16.973 --> 25:19.058
Well, what does that mean?

25:19.267 --> 25:22.770
It means that my guys won't
get off their Barcaloungers...

25:22.938 --> 25:26.649
...and you have a uterus that is
prepared to kill the ones that do.

25:29.444 --> 25:31.695
- It means...
- Wait, Chandler.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.786
It means that we can keep trying...

25:39.412 --> 25:43.123
...but there's a good chance
this may never happen for us.

25:48.838 --> 25:50.798
Oh, my God.

25:52.926 --> 25:54.593
I'm sorry.

25:55.178 --> 25:57.012
I'm sorry too.

26:00.684 --> 26:02.059
Well...

26:02.602 --> 26:05.604
...we're gonna figure this out.

26:08.650 --> 26:10.401
I know.

26:27.085 --> 26:30.879
- Good morning, Phoebe.
- Good morning, receptionist.

26:31.047 --> 26:34.592
Here's your schedule for the day.
Your first client is in Room 1.

26:34.801 --> 26:39.013
"Rachel Green."
Son of a bitch! She came back?

26:47.188 --> 26:50.566
Are you ready for your Scottish massage?

26:50.900 --> 26:53.152
Put your face in the hole, lassie!
