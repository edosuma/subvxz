WEBVTT

00:14.625 --> 00:17.625
Stay here,
I will be back for you.

00:19.125 --> 00:20.708
- There's been
an accident.
- What accident?

00:20.750 --> 00:23.625
What are you talking about?
Where's Dad?

00:23.708 --> 00:26.833
You were supposed to be there.

00:26.916 --> 00:28.333
That was the plan.

00:28.416 --> 00:31.166
I'm sorry
I wasn't there for you, my love.

00:31.250 --> 00:33.625
But I'm here now.

00:33.666 --> 00:36.166
Am I losing my mind
like Geraldine?

00:36.250 --> 00:38.208
No, no.

00:38.291 --> 00:39.416
Uh, well, yes.

00:39.500 --> 00:42.666
And no.
Some people can see more,

00:42.750 --> 00:44.791
they can feel more,
they can know more.

00:44.875 --> 00:47.250
Uh, your grandmother was one of
those people are you are, too.

00:47.333 --> 00:49.166
One of those people?

00:49.250 --> 00:50.541
You're mentally ill.

00:50.625 --> 00:52.541
You didn't travel back in time.

00:52.625 --> 00:55.166
And your father doesn't talk
to you because he's dead.

00:55.250 --> 00:56.958
I'd break up with you right now.

00:57.041 --> 00:58.833
But after
the timeline's realigned,

00:58.916 --> 01:01.750
I'll have never even met you.

01:01.833 --> 01:04.833
Dad didn't come.

01:04.875 --> 01:07.000
I just need to be sure
Dad's not going

01:07.083 --> 01:08.833
to come out of that cave.

01:08.875 --> 01:10.791
I'll meet you in the car.

01:46.583 --> 01:48.583
Please tell me you found her.

01:48.666 --> 01:50.000
I found her.

01:50.083 --> 01:51.333
She's safe.

01:51.416 --> 01:52.833
Thank God.

01:52.916 --> 01:55.458
- Sam, she's safe.
- That's a relief.

01:55.541 --> 01:58.000
She's open to coming home,
and maybe even taking the pills.

01:58.083 --> 01:59.833
What about
the mental health clinic?

01:59.916 --> 02:01.958
I'll see if there's
a good time to bring it up.

02:02.041 --> 02:03.791
She stole my car
and drove it to Mexico

02:03.875 --> 02:06.083
to see her dead father.
She needs help, Becca.

02:06.166 --> 02:07.625
I know, Mom.

02:07.708 --> 02:09.416
We'll get her help.

02:30.833 --> 02:33.208
Dad?

02:36.791 --> 02:38.583
Dad?

02:50.166 --> 02:52.166
Dad?!

02:53.666 --> 02:55.666
Did it not work?

03:03.625 --> 03:05.625
Dad?

03:18.583 --> 03:21.083
You can't do this to me again.

03:31.458 --> 03:32.916
Ay niÃ±a.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.333
You look lost.

03:34.416 --> 03:36.041
Can I help?

03:36.125 --> 03:37.791
Thanks, I'm fine.

03:37.875 --> 03:39.375
My sister's waiting for me.

03:39.458 --> 03:41.416
Is that why you're crying?

03:42.958 --> 03:44.416
No.

03:45.583 --> 03:47.500
I'm crying because...

03:47.583 --> 03:50.375
because I can't be
who everyone thinks I am.

03:50.458 --> 03:53.541
It's never too late
to change things.

03:53.625 --> 03:55.333
Yeah.

03:55.416 --> 03:57.750
But what if they're right
about me?

03:57.833 --> 03:59.791
Do you think
they're right about you?

03:59.875 --> 04:01.666
I just want to run away,
you know?

04:01.750 --> 04:03.791
But instead I have
to climb into my mom's car

04:03.875 --> 04:06.958
next to my sister...
and be the family fuck up.

04:07.041 --> 04:09.750
I don't see a car.

04:12.625 --> 04:15.041
What?

04:15.125 --> 04:17.000
Where's the car?

04:25.208 --> 04:26.916
Hey, Alma. What's up?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.833
"Hey Alma. What's up?"
Where are you?

04:28.916 --> 04:30.541
I'm in Bora Bora.

04:30.625 --> 04:32.583
I'm on my honeymoon with Reed.
We left yesterday

04:32.666 --> 04:34.375
after the wedding.
You know this.

04:34.458 --> 04:35.875
Wait. What?

04:35.958 --> 04:38.083
Alma, it's00
in the morning, okay?

04:38.166 --> 04:40.541
What do you want? You want
to talk to me? What's going on?

04:40.625 --> 04:42.625
Wait. What?!

04:42.708 --> 04:45.083
It's called time zones, okay?
You know how they work.

04:45.166 --> 04:46.625
- Did it actually happen?
- Yes.

04:46.708 --> 04:48.208
I actually married Reed.
And don't pretend

04:48.291 --> 04:50.083
like you don't like him
because I know you do.

04:50.166 --> 04:52.000
- Is that your sister?
- Uh-huh.

04:52.083 --> 04:55.000
Tell her Bora Bora
is Bora Boring without her.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.041
- Reed says hi.
- That's not what I said.

04:59.125 --> 05:01.500
Becca, Dad-- where is he?

05:01.583 --> 05:04.125
How should I know, Alma?
I'm in freaking Bora Bora.

05:04.208 --> 05:07.500
And Reed says it's
Bora Boring without you.

05:07.583 --> 05:08.833
Thank you.

05:08.916 --> 05:10.583
- She laugh?
- Mm-hmm.

05:10.666 --> 05:12.791
Wait, bu-but
Da-but Dad is alive?

05:12.875 --> 05:14.333
Jesus Christ, Alma.

05:14.416 --> 05:16.625
Now you're freaking me out.
Did something happen to Dad?

05:16.708 --> 05:18.416
No. No.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.875
I-I just had a weird dream
that he wasn't alive.

05:20.958 --> 05:23.041
But he is alive, right?

05:23.125 --> 05:25.333
Alma, I am, like,
very tired, okay?

05:25.416 --> 05:27.833
And I have to go parasailing
in three hours.

05:27.916 --> 05:30.291
- Got to go. I love you. Bye.
- Wait, wait,
but Dad's alive, right?

05:35.458 --> 05:37.833
I think my dad's alive.

05:37.916 --> 05:39.500
Wonderful.

05:39.583 --> 05:41.500
Does that mean you can go home?

05:41.583 --> 05:44.000
It means the world
is a magical place.

05:44.083 --> 05:45.833
And anything is possible.

05:45.916 --> 05:49.166
Well, I hope your life
will be perfect now

05:49.250 --> 05:52.083
and everyone will love you.

05:52.166 --> 05:53.625
Yeah.

05:53.708 --> 05:55.291
Me too.

06:18.958 --> 06:20.958
- Uh...
- Ah!

06:22.666 --> 06:24.500
Are you okay?

06:24.583 --> 06:26.291
Ah, yes. I'm fine.

06:26.375 --> 06:29.125
Are you mad... at me?

06:29.208 --> 06:30.791
Why would I be mad at you?

06:30.875 --> 06:33.125
Don't know.

06:35.750 --> 06:37.958
If you're looking for your
father, he's in his office.

06:38.041 --> 06:40.041
Okay.

07:01.625 --> 07:03.625
Come in.

07:14.208 --> 07:16.041
Dad.

07:16.125 --> 07:17.708
Hey, Alma.

07:17.791 --> 07:19.750
Dad.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.333
It's me.

07:23.416 --> 07:25.541
It worked.

07:25.625 --> 07:27.791
The timelines realigned.

07:27.875 --> 07:29.708
Alma.

07:29.791 --> 07:31.708
My Alma? Are you...

07:31.791 --> 07:33.750
You're here?

07:33.833 --> 07:35.291
You remember?

07:35.375 --> 07:36.625
Yeah.

07:36.708 --> 07:38.083
Oh, my God.

07:42.291 --> 07:45.000
Oh, my God. I didn't know
if it would ever happen!

07:45.083 --> 07:46.333
Did you become energy?

07:46.416 --> 07:48.416
- What was that like?
- Um, I don't know. Cool?

07:49.958 --> 07:51.708
Incredible.
It's just incredible!

07:51.791 --> 07:53.458
Dad!

07:53.541 --> 07:56.083
You're so... old now.

07:56.166 --> 07:58.875
Yeah, well, it's great
to see you, too.

07:58.958 --> 08:01.125
I've been waiting for you

08:01.208 --> 08:03.208
since I merged with myself.

08:03.291 --> 08:06.250
That was Halloween night
17 years ago.

08:06.333 --> 08:08.041
God, for me that was yesterday.

08:08.125 --> 08:10.875
Well, you've been here
this whole time, too.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.416
It's just that this
consciousness has-has merged

08:13.500 --> 08:15.250
with this timeline.

08:15.333 --> 08:17.791
That's you at the science fair.
High school.

08:17.875 --> 08:19.750
You came in second place.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.791
The kid who came in first
had built

08:21.875 --> 08:23.958
a rocket ship powered
by grass clippings...

08:24.041 --> 08:26.166
And you said,
"If you need more grass,

08:26.250 --> 08:27.625
you should go mow our lawn."

08:27.708 --> 08:29.083
Whoa.

08:29.166 --> 08:31.291
I'm getting memories from here.

08:31.375 --> 08:34.041
That's fascinating.
Here. Try this one.

08:34.125 --> 08:35.916
This is college.

08:37.625 --> 08:40.583
You've been here for everything.

08:40.666 --> 08:42.500
My whole life.

08:43.708 --> 08:45.708
Me and Becca and your mom...

08:47.958 --> 08:49.708
Oh! You're gonna be late.

08:49.791 --> 08:51.500
- Late? For what?
- Class.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.166
- Class?
- You're a professor

08:53.250 --> 08:54.458
here at the university with me.

08:54.541 --> 08:55.791
You have a class right now.

08:55.875 --> 08:56.958
- Shut up.
- Yeah, come on.

08:57.041 --> 08:58.583
What? I can't teach college.

08:58.666 --> 09:00.041
- Yes, you can.
- I just got here.

09:00.125 --> 09:01.708
- I'll show you.
- Okay.

09:10.166 --> 09:12.166
You can do this.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.250
Hi.

09:19.333 --> 09:21.583
I am your professor...

09:21.666 --> 09:23.750
Professor Winograd-Diaz.

09:25.500 --> 09:28.416
But, of course,
you already know that,

09:28.500 --> 09:31.208
so it's weird
for me to say that.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.375
Come on, memories.

09:47.208 --> 09:48.458
What?

09:50.458 --> 09:53.666
But what if I told you
I'm a tree?

09:57.958 --> 10:00.416
Or a house.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.333
What if I told you
I'm the Earth

10:02.416 --> 10:04.500
and the sun and the moon

10:04.583 --> 10:06.291
and the entire universe?

10:06.375 --> 10:07.958
I'm the past...

10:08.041 --> 10:09.958
and the present, the future.

10:10.041 --> 10:12.041
I am all things.

10:12.125 --> 10:15.416
I am... Teotzin.

10:18.833 --> 10:20.875
Who is Teotzin?

10:21.916 --> 10:23.791
What is Teotzin?

10:23.875 --> 10:25.375
I got it!

10:25.458 --> 10:29.125
In Nahua philosophy,
Teotzin is the sacred power

10:29.208 --> 10:33.166
that animates everything
and is everything.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.625
Teotzin is you.
Teotzin is me...

10:35.708 --> 10:38.000
and-and the tree and the house.

10:38.083 --> 10:41.708
All of it, all of us,
everything is Teotzin.

10:42.750 --> 10:46.166
The appearance
that we're separate...

10:48.625 --> 10:50.500
...is merely an illusion.

10:51.541 --> 10:52.791
Whoa.

10:52.875 --> 10:55.750
That's cool.

10:57.291 --> 10:59.666
It just came to me.

10:59.750 --> 11:01.166
All of that knowledge.
Oh, my God,

11:01.250 --> 11:02.875
I can't believe
we get to do this together.

11:02.958 --> 11:05.250
- I know. It's so thrilling.
- What else do I know how to do?

11:05.333 --> 11:06.708
Well, I pushed you
to learn piano.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.791
- You're pretty good.
- No kidding-- I always wished

11:08.875 --> 11:10.500
someone had forced me
to play piano.

11:10.583 --> 11:11.791
And you speak Spanish.

11:11.875 --> 11:12.500
Don't tell me this!

11:12.583 --> 11:13.333
I speak Spanish?

11:13.416 --> 11:14.708
Yes, I do speak Spanish!

11:14.791 --> 11:16.708
I encouraged your mother
to speak her native language

11:16.791 --> 11:18.625
around the house. Uh...

11:18.708 --> 11:23.333
And now I speak
a little Spanish, too!

11:24.541 --> 11:26.583
Your accent is... hilarious.

11:26.666 --> 11:28.583
I think you mean excelente.

11:28.666 --> 11:30.583
No, I don't think
that's what I meant.

11:32.375 --> 11:35.500
And we should get back
into your dissertation.

11:35.583 --> 11:36.750
Uh, dissertation?

11:36.833 --> 11:39.375
Yeah. You're writing
your PhD dissertation.

11:39.458 --> 11:41.041
Once you defend and publish,

11:41.125 --> 11:43.125
you'll be tenure-tracked
and set for life.

11:43.208 --> 11:45.541
Ah. Any way to skip ahead
a couple years?

11:45.625 --> 11:47.916
- Because that sounds awful.
- Don't worry.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.125
I'll help you with it,
like always.

11:54.375 --> 11:56.000
But...

11:56.083 --> 11:58.750
what if I'm not as good as her?

11:58.833 --> 12:00.416
Who?

12:00.500 --> 12:02.541
- The other Alma.
- Other?

12:02.625 --> 12:04.625
Uh, you are her, right?

12:04.708 --> 12:06.625
You're just remembering
the other timeline.

12:06.708 --> 12:08.250
This'll all come back to you.

12:08.333 --> 12:09.833
You're gonna love this life.

12:09.916 --> 12:12.750
Yeah. Right.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.916
I know.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.125
Hey, what are
my friends like here?

12:17.208 --> 12:19.333
What about Sam?
Do I even know him?

12:19.416 --> 12:22.375
Uh, we don't really talk
about that kind of thing.

12:22.458 --> 12:24.041
Got it.

12:27.875 --> 12:30.250
What are you doing
with these photos of your mom?

12:30.333 --> 12:32.500
I'm trying
to understand her better.

12:32.583 --> 12:35.750
You know, why she made
the choices she made...

12:35.833 --> 12:37.958
why she lost her mind.

12:38.041 --> 12:40.041
Like you were before.

12:40.125 --> 12:43.083
Have you traveled back in time
to find out?

12:43.166 --> 12:45.416
No. My abilities
are more limited

12:45.500 --> 12:47.958
since I'm back
in my physical body.

12:48.041 --> 12:50.791
So I'm just researching
the old-fashioned way.

12:50.875 --> 12:54.541
- What have you found?
- Well, uh,
she changed her first name

12:54.625 --> 12:56.916
when she came through
the Port of Galveston.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
That was pretty common,
wasn't it?

12:59.083 --> 13:02.291
People wanted to assimilate,
or were forced to.

13:02.375 --> 13:05.416
Yeah. But her first name was,
uh, Ruchel,

13:05.500 --> 13:07.583
which translates to Rachel.

13:07.666 --> 13:09.583
So why Geraldine?

13:09.666 --> 13:11.166
Maybe we could travel back
together and find out.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.166
- I'll help you.
- Uh, no, no.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.916
Come on! It'll be fun!

13:17.958 --> 13:20.291
- Cops?

13:22.166 --> 13:23.875
- It's too dangerous.
- Dangerous?

13:23.958 --> 13:26.041
What do you mean?
We saved you, didn't we?

13:26.125 --> 13:27.666
Think of what else we could do--

13:27.750 --> 13:30.208
all the truths we could uncover,
all the lives we could help.

13:30.291 --> 13:32.083
Yeah. Think of all
the damage we could do

13:32.166 --> 13:33.916
and all the people
that we could hurt.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.125
You know, we lucked out.

13:35.208 --> 13:37.875
I got a new life.
You got a new life.

13:37.958 --> 13:41.166
- Do you want to risk this?
- But you've always wanted
to go back and help your mom.

13:41.250 --> 13:42.916
That's why you started your
research in the first place--

13:43.000 --> 13:44.125
so she wouldn't be
institutionalized.

13:44.208 --> 13:47.666
Your mother was worried
that I was schizophrenic,

13:47.750 --> 13:49.541
so my research had to stop.

13:49.625 --> 13:52.666
I focused
on you and Becca, okay?

13:52.750 --> 13:54.958
You're my life now,
and I am happy.

13:58.416 --> 14:00.333
Come on, let's just try not try.

14:00.416 --> 14:03.791
- No, I don't want to.

14:05.458 --> 14:06.375
Alma.

14:06.458 --> 14:07.791
Alma, stop. Alma.

14:15.750 --> 14:19.041
Aah! Dad!

14:19.125 --> 14:20.041
Aah!

14:21.958 --> 14:22.958
- No.
- Alma.

14:23.041 --> 14:24.166
I couldn't control it.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.458
I couldn't go anywhere.

14:25.541 --> 14:26.750
Oh, my God.

14:26.833 --> 14:29.291
Do I not have abilities
in this life?

14:29.375 --> 14:31.541
You haven't really tried,
but maybe it's an indication

14:31.625 --> 14:33.541
that you
should leave that aside.

14:33.625 --> 14:35.208
But what am I supposed
to do here?

14:35.291 --> 14:37.083
You're supposed to make
the most of this life.

14:37.166 --> 14:38.750
Right here, right now.

14:38.833 --> 14:41.000
It's a great life
that we've built, together.

14:41.083 --> 14:42.208
Your dad's alive.

14:42.291 --> 14:43.833
Isn't that extraordinary enough?

14:44.875 --> 14:46.791
Of course it is.

15:10.291 --> 15:12.250
Hi.

15:53.791 --> 15:56.166
Sam?

17:20.416 --> 17:21.708
- Oh!

17:21.791 --> 17:23.416
Oh, my God. Oh...

17:47.375 --> 17:48.791
So...

17:48.875 --> 17:50.333
how was the honeymoon?

17:50.416 --> 17:51.625
Great.

17:51.708 --> 17:54.083
We stayed
in an overwater bungalow.

17:54.166 --> 17:55.708
What is an overwater bungalow?

17:55.791 --> 17:57.833
They build bungalows
right on top of the water.

17:57.916 --> 17:59.833
So, like, in the morning,
you just open your door

17:59.916 --> 18:01.250
and you go right into the ocean.

18:01.333 --> 18:03.625
Yeah, I saw a woman
get hit by a truck today.

18:03.708 --> 18:06.125
- Oh, my God. Is she okay?
- Ay.

18:06.208 --> 18:08.125
I don't know. There was nothing
I could do to help.

18:08.208 --> 18:10.166
I just watched her flop around
like a dying fish.

18:10.250 --> 18:11.708
Okay, Alma.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.416
But then an ambulance came,

18:14.500 --> 18:16.333
- so I'm sure she's fine.
- Okay, well, good.

18:16.416 --> 18:18.416
So she got the help
that she needed, right?

18:18.500 --> 18:20.041
Yeah.

18:21.083 --> 18:25.000
So, any chance we'll be
expecting a grandbaby soon?

18:25.083 --> 18:27.250
Mom! Oh, my God.

18:27.333 --> 18:29.333
Well, you're married.
What are you waiting for?

18:29.416 --> 18:30.833
Truth is, we aren't waiting.

18:30.916 --> 18:32.833
Reed! You're not supposed
to say anything

18:32.916 --> 18:34.875
until we're actually pregnant.

18:34.958 --> 18:36.166
Oh, shoot. Sorry.

18:36.250 --> 18:38.750
- That is exciting.
- It certainly is.

18:38.833 --> 18:41.583
Yeah, congrats, I guess,
on having unprotected sex.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.250
Excuse me.

18:48.458 --> 18:49.875
Hello?

18:49.958 --> 18:52.666
You know,
they call them dinner rolls,

18:52.750 --> 18:54.708
but I could eat them
all the time. Honestly.

19:16.375 --> 19:17.500
Aah!

19:17.583 --> 19:19.125
...all the time.
Some people believe

19:19.208 --> 19:22.458
that time is actually
all happening at once,

19:22.541 --> 19:24.458
we only experience it linearly.

19:24.541 --> 19:25.916
- What?
- Whoa.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.708
Mind blown.

19:28.791 --> 19:31.166
So, can I...
can I still eat this?

19:32.416 --> 19:33.791
Here we go. Here we go.

19:39.250 --> 19:40.875
Here we go.

19:40.958 --> 19:42.083
Aah!

19:45.625 --> 19:47.458
Aah!

19:49.166 --> 19:50.625
Ah!

19:56.166 --> 19:58.000
Oh, yeah!

20:08.875 --> 20:11.000
Dad. I did it.

20:11.083 --> 20:12.583
I pushed through.
I traveled out of the fog.

20:12.666 --> 20:14.125
Close the door.

20:14.208 --> 20:16.708
But I-I keep trying, and I
keep ending up back in the fog.

20:16.791 --> 20:18.500
Why is that?
Why can't I recreate it?

20:18.583 --> 20:20.500
- I don't know.
- You're a brilliant physicist.

20:20.583 --> 20:23.750
- Let's figure it out.
- We don't have to figure it out
if you stop trying.

20:23.833 --> 20:25.333
Uh, Dad...

20:25.416 --> 20:27.375
I think something's up with Mom.

20:27.458 --> 20:30.500
I saw her arguing with a man
in his car outside of the house.

20:30.583 --> 20:32.000
I don't want to hear this.

20:32.083 --> 20:33.375
But what if she's in trouble?

20:33.458 --> 20:35.375
She's been crying and sleeping
during the day--

20:35.458 --> 20:36.916
that is not her.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.333
Then she jumped up during
dinner to take a phone call?

20:39.416 --> 20:41.166
Mom. Phone Nazi.

20:41.250 --> 20:43.416
If you think your mother's in
trouble, why don't you ask her?

20:43.500 --> 20:45.125
Because she's obviously
keeping it a secret.

20:45.208 --> 20:46.541
Maybe it's something
you don't need to know.

20:46.625 --> 20:48.166
- But if I know, I can help her.
- Maybe she doesn't

20:48.250 --> 20:49.416
- want your help.
- Maybe she doesn't want my help

20:49.500 --> 20:50.875
but maybe she needs my help.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.333
Alma, I have a second life here,

20:53.416 --> 20:54.875
a second chance.

20:54.958 --> 20:57.333
I'm doing everything I can
to deserve this.

20:57.416 --> 20:59.250
I don't want to jeopardize it.

20:59.333 --> 21:01.458
But we could make things
even better.

21:01.541 --> 21:03.583
Or I could lose myself, again.

21:03.666 --> 21:06.208
My research, my obsession
with accessing these abilities.

21:06.291 --> 21:08.458
Do you remember
I left you on a street corner

21:08.541 --> 21:09.666
when you were a child?

21:09.750 --> 21:10.916
I've done terrible things.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.125
That was a different you.

21:12.208 --> 21:13.666
That is still a part of me.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.166
I don't want to open the door

21:15.250 --> 21:17.625
- to that guy.
- Dad, we have the power
to help...

21:17.708 --> 21:19.750
Your grandmother and I
lost ourselves,

21:19.833 --> 21:21.916
and I don't want to see
that happen to you.

21:23.916 --> 21:27.541
Dad, today, when I watched
that woman get hit by a truck...

21:27.625 --> 21:29.875
I couldn't do anything to help.

21:29.958 --> 21:32.416
Maybe it wasn't
your responsibility.

21:33.791 --> 21:35.583
Not everything is.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.750
- Becca.

21:50.833 --> 21:51.958
Wait.

21:52.041 --> 21:54.625
Oh, I'm sorry we didn't say bye,
but I saw you were

21:54.708 --> 21:56.416
in Dad's office,
so I figured you were working.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.833
Becca. Can I talk to you

21:57.916 --> 21:59.916
- for a second?
- I'll be in the car.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.375
There's some Tahitian
ukulele music calling my name.

22:02.458 --> 22:03.791
S... So silly.

22:03.875 --> 22:05.541
Yeah. I wanted to ask you

22:05.625 --> 22:07.500
is there something
going on with Mom?

22:07.583 --> 22:09.083
Yeah, no, I know.

22:09.166 --> 22:10.916
Something is definitely
going on with her.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.791
I just tried to talk to her
about it,

22:12.875 --> 22:13.916
and she won't talk to me.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.750
- Well, what do you think it is?
- Well...

22:15.833 --> 22:18.125
I did see something.

22:18.208 --> 22:20.458
Early in the morning
after the wedding, I stopped by

22:20.541 --> 22:23.416
to drop some stuff off
before taking our flight.

22:23.500 --> 22:26.958
Mom was in the car
outside the house.

22:37.333 --> 22:38.708
Becca.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.333
What are you doing here?

22:40.416 --> 22:42.791
Oh, my God.

22:42.875 --> 22:44.791
Wait, it was you.

22:44.875 --> 22:46.958
You're the one who saw this.

22:47.041 --> 22:48.625
- What?

22:48.708 --> 22:51.833
No, Alejandro.
You need to go. Now!

22:52.875 --> 22:55.041
Mom, who was that?

22:55.125 --> 22:58.375
It's nothing. An old friend.

22:58.458 --> 23:00.625
What? Who?

23:02.291 --> 23:05.541
So you were thinking about this
during dinner.

23:05.625 --> 23:08.250
What I saw, I saw through you.

23:08.333 --> 23:10.166
You saw that?

23:10.250 --> 23:13.208
But no one's ever been able
to see that before.

23:13.291 --> 23:14.375
Before?!

23:14.458 --> 23:16.416
This has happened before?

23:16.500 --> 23:17.708
- You can visit past memories?
- Well...

23:17.791 --> 23:19.375
You can move through time
like that?

23:19.458 --> 23:21.416
No, I'm not, like,
time traveling or anything.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.583
- It's not weird like that.
- Becca.

23:23.666 --> 23:26.166
You are time traveling.
You are a time traveler.

23:26.250 --> 23:27.750
And so am I.

23:27.833 --> 23:29.750
I mean,
I can't right now, but...

23:29.833 --> 23:32.625
we can do this together.

23:35.500 --> 23:36.750
What?
