03:02.295 --> 03:03.660
Fucking God!

05:00.380 --> 05:02.314
''Apartment For Rent''

05:13.393 --> 05:14.485
l`d like a phone slug.

05:14.561 --> 05:17.121
- All out. Down, back and left.
- Thanks.

06:09.416 --> 06:11.850
Momma, this is Jeanne.

06:11.918 --> 06:14.250
There`s an apartment in Passy
l`m going to see.

06:15.689 --> 06:19.682
Then l go meet Tom at the station.

06:19.759 --> 06:21.693
See you later.

06:21.761 --> 06:24.127
Kisses. So long.

06:25.865 --> 06:28.265
l`m here for the apartment.

06:28.334 --> 06:29.562
l saw the sign.

06:29.636 --> 06:30.864
- Sign?
- Yes.

06:30.937 --> 06:32.529
What sign?

06:32.605 --> 06:36.132
Always the same.
Nobody tells me anything.

06:36.209 --> 06:38.905
- l`d like to see it.
- To rent it?

06:38.978 --> 06:40.240
l don`t know yet.

06:40.313 --> 06:44.647
They rent, they leave,
and l`m the last to know.

06:44.718 --> 06:47.744
You think that`s fair?

06:49.122 --> 06:52.216
lf you want to go up alone,
go on.

06:52.292 --> 06:54.226
l`m afraid of the rats.

06:55.762 --> 06:58.253
The key is gone.

06:58.331 --> 07:00.356
Lots of strange things happen.

07:04.170 --> 07:06.638
They drink six bottles a day.

07:10.944 --> 07:14.004
Wait. There must be a duplicate.

07:22.956 --> 07:23.888
Here it is.

07:23.957 --> 07:26.482
You`re very young, right?

07:29.262 --> 07:31.253
Let me go, please.

07:37.604 --> 07:39.538
She`s crazy.

08:33.592 --> 08:35.527
Where are you?

08:38.765 --> 08:40.698
What a fright.
How`d you get in?

08:43.669 --> 08:44.898
By the door.

08:44.971 --> 08:47.337
Oh, yes. l left it open.

08:47.407 --> 08:49.341
But l didn`t hear you come in.

08:51.110 --> 08:54.079
- l was already here.
- Excuse me?

08:55.748 --> 08:58.239
Then the key--

08:58.318 --> 09:00.252
And l bribed the concierge.

09:05.358 --> 09:07.792
These old houses are fascinating.

09:13.933 --> 09:15.867
An armchair would look good here.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.174
The armchair has to go...

09:23.309 --> 09:24.799
in front of the window.

09:24.878 --> 09:26.812
You are American?

09:29.682 --> 09:31.616
You have an American accent.

10:28.508 --> 10:30.738
- Will you rent it?
- And you?

10:32.111 --> 10:34.045
l don`t know.

11:07.814 --> 11:09.748
What are you doing?

11:52.959 --> 11:54.893
Do l answer or not?

12:05.138 --> 12:06.867
There`s no one here.

12:06.939 --> 12:10.136
There is no one.

12:10.209 --> 12:12.143
l don`t know.

12:57.056 --> 12:59.490
Then you decided to take it?

13:04.330 --> 13:06.264
l had decided, but--

13:08.034 --> 13:10.161
But now l don`t know.

13:12.905 --> 13:14.839
Do you like it?

13:15.708 --> 13:17.369
Do you?

13:17.443 --> 13:19.377
l have to think about it.

13:28.087 --> 13:30.021
Think fast.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.169
You still here?

18:17.376 --> 18:18.308
Attention.

18:18.377 --> 18:20.572
Who do they take us for?

18:20.646 --> 18:23.376
This is cinema.
We`re making a movie.

18:23.449 --> 18:27.215
lf l kiss you,
that might be cinema.

18:27.286 --> 18:30.687
lf l caress you,
it might be cinema.

18:30.756 --> 18:33.884
What the devil do they want?
l know them.

18:33.959 --> 18:38.589
l`m shooting a film-- ''Portrait
of a Girl--'' for television.

18:38.664 --> 18:40.632
And the girl is you.

18:40.699 --> 18:43.668
But you`re mad! You should have
asked my permission.

18:43.736 --> 18:45.670
Yes, but it amuses me...

18:45.738 --> 18:50.175
to begin with the girl
of the portrait who meets her fiance.

18:50.242 --> 18:52.073
This is my crew.

18:52.144 --> 18:54.578
And so you kiss me...

18:54.647 --> 18:58.708
knowing it`s a film.

18:58.784 --> 19:00.251
Coward!

19:00.319 --> 19:03.117
See, it`ll be most of all
a love story.

19:05.257 --> 19:06.781
Tell me,Jeanne.

19:06.859 --> 19:09.089
What did you do
while l was away?

19:09.161 --> 19:12.221
l thought of you day and night
and l cried.

19:12.298 --> 19:14.562
Darling, l can`t
live without you.

19:14.633 --> 19:16.601
Magnificent! Stop! Perfect!

19:26.712 --> 19:28.976
l wanted to clean up...

19:29.048 --> 19:31.983
but the police didn`t let me.

19:32.051 --> 19:34.451
They didn`t believe in suicide.

19:34.520 --> 19:36.078
Too much blood all over.

19:39.058 --> 19:41.151
They had fun making me reenact.

19:48.267 --> 19:50.201
''She went there.

19:54.306 --> 19:56.240
She went here.

20:00.312 --> 20:02.246
She opened the curtain.``

20:03.349 --> 20:04.976
l did everything like her.

20:05.050 --> 20:07.951
The clients, awake all night.

20:08.020 --> 20:11.114
The hotel full of police.

20:11.190 --> 20:13.124
They playing around with the blood.

20:25.771 --> 20:28.103
All spies.

20:28.173 --> 20:31.301
lf she was sad,
if she was happy...

20:31.377 --> 20:33.572
lf you fought,
if you hit each other.

20:33.646 --> 20:35.773
And then when you were married...

20:35.848 --> 20:37.782
why you didn`t have children.

20:39.418 --> 20:41.352
Pigs.

20:44.290 --> 20:46.588
They treated me like dirt.

20:46.659 --> 20:48.627
They said...

20:48.694 --> 20:50.628
''Nervous type, your boss.

20:53.832 --> 20:55.493
You know he was a boxer?``

20:57.236 --> 20:59.466
So?

20:59.538 --> 21:01.472
''But he didn`t do well.''

21:03.175 --> 21:04.608
Then he was...

21:06.111 --> 21:07.738
an actor.

21:07.813 --> 21:09.747
And then a bongo player.

21:15.688 --> 21:18.919
Revolutionary in South America.

21:18.991 --> 21:21.619
Journalist in Japan.

21:21.694 --> 21:24.822
One day he debarks in Tahiti.

21:24.897 --> 21:26.831
Wanders around.

21:27.900 --> 21:30.698
Learns French.

21:30.769 --> 21:32.930
Then he arrives in Paris.

21:33.005 --> 21:34.370
And here...

21:38.444 --> 21:41.311
meets a woman with money.

21:41.380 --> 21:42.711
Marries her and--

21:44.550 --> 21:46.484
''Now what`s your boss do?''

21:47.820 --> 21:49.412
He`s kept.

21:50.689 --> 21:52.782
''Can l clean up now?''

21:52.858 --> 21:55.793
''Don`t touch anything.

21:55.861 --> 21:58.227
You really think...

21:59.164 --> 22:01.564
she killed herself?``

22:03.569 --> 22:05.935
And then he pushed me
in a corner trying to--

22:09.241 --> 22:10.538
Turn off the water.

22:10.609 --> 22:13.305
Maybe they`ll do an autopsy.

22:17.349 --> 22:19.783
Why don`t you
turn off the water?

22:19.852 --> 22:21.786
Here`s your razor.

22:26.392 --> 22:28.155
lt`s not mine.

22:28.227 --> 22:30.388
They don`t need it anymore.

22:30.462 --> 22:32.396
The inquiry is over.

22:34.400 --> 22:38.530
Yes, she had some cuts here
and on the neck.

23:55.180 --> 23:56.841
Excuse me.
Where should l put it?

23:56.915 --> 24:00.043
- You could have rung.
- lt was open. Here?

24:02.387 --> 24:04.321
No, in front of the fireplace.

24:06.825 --> 24:08.759
And these chairs?

24:13.065 --> 24:15.295
Here`s the table.
Where do l put it?

24:15.367 --> 24:16.857
How do l know?
He`ll decide.

24:16.935 --> 24:18.926
l`ll leave it here.

24:22.207 --> 24:24.675
- Heavy. lt`s really a double.
- But it won`t fit.

24:24.743 --> 24:27.974
You`ll see.
Your husband`ll find room.

24:35.854 --> 24:37.788
What a mess.

24:38.490 --> 24:40.082
Thank you.

24:48.667 --> 24:52.364
This armchair has to go
in front of the window.

24:52.437 --> 24:53.631
Like that.

24:53.705 --> 24:56.970
l only came to return the key.

24:57.042 --> 24:59.442
- To return it to you.
- What do l care?

24:59.511 --> 25:01.445
Take off your coat.

25:03.148 --> 25:05.082
Come on. Give me a hand.

25:09.021 --> 25:11.251
Take these chairs...

25:11.323 --> 25:13.257
and put them here.

25:16.628 --> 25:19.722
Put them on the other side.

25:19.798 --> 25:21.732
Take it too.

25:28.140 --> 25:29.767
You didn`t lose any time.

25:34.346 --> 25:36.837
Listen, sir...

25:36.915 --> 25:39.042
l have to go.

25:39.117 --> 25:41.585
Look, sir, l`ve gotta go.

25:43.689 --> 25:46.988
The bed is too big
for the room.

25:47.059 --> 25:49.050
l don`t know what to call you.

25:49.127 --> 25:51.425
l don`t have a name.

25:51.496 --> 25:53.293
- You want to know my name?
- No, l don`t!

25:53.365 --> 25:55.856
l don`t wanna know your name.

25:55.934 --> 25:57.799
You don`t have a name
and l don`t have a name either.

25:57.870 --> 26:00.964
No names here.
Not one name.

26:01.039 --> 26:02.666
You`re crazy.

26:02.741 --> 26:06.074
Maybe l am, but l don`t wanna know
anything about you.

26:06.144 --> 26:08.612
l don`t wanna know where you live
or where you come from.

26:08.680 --> 26:11.376
l wanna know nothing!
You understand?

26:11.450 --> 26:13.384
- You scare me.
- Nothing.

26:15.754 --> 26:17.722
You and l are gonna meet here...

26:17.789 --> 26:20.553
without knowing anything
that goes on outside here.

26:24.696 --> 26:26.630
But why?

26:28.033 --> 26:30.024
Because...

26:30.102 --> 26:32.900
we don`t need names here.

26:34.973 --> 26:36.907
Don`t you see?

26:39.311 --> 26:41.404
We`re gonna forget...

26:41.480 --> 26:43.175
everything that we knew.

26:43.248 --> 26:45.682
Every-- All the people...

26:45.751 --> 26:47.582
all that we do, all that we--

26:47.653 --> 26:50.315
Wherever we live.

26:50.389 --> 26:52.880
We`re going to forget that.
Everything.

26:57.329 --> 26:59.263
But l can`t.

27:01.033 --> 27:03.365
Can you?

27:03.435 --> 27:05.369
l don`t know.

27:07.839 --> 27:09.773
Are you scared?

27:20.252 --> 27:22.186
Come.

27:56.421 --> 27:59.720
- l thought l`d find you here.
- l expected you later.

28:05.597 --> 28:07.531
l took the first train.

28:09.634 --> 28:12.535
Paul, how horrible!

28:36.128 --> 28:38.062
Papa is in bed with asthma.

28:42.701 --> 28:45.363
The doctors forbade him
to come.

28:46.671 --> 28:48.002
Better.

28:49.107 --> 28:50.438
l`m stronger.

29:11.430 --> 29:14.126
What are you looking for?

29:14.199 --> 29:16.224
Something that explains it.

29:16.301 --> 29:18.360
A letter, a clue--

29:21.406 --> 29:23.874
There`s nothing,
absolutely nothing.

29:31.583 --> 29:33.608
lt`s impossible
that my little Rose--

29:33.685 --> 29:36.813
Nothing for her mother.
Not a word.

29:36.888 --> 29:38.947
Useless to look anymore.

29:41.893 --> 29:44.293
Not even for you,
her husband.

29:52.871 --> 29:54.805
You need to rest.

29:57.142 --> 29:59.110
Maybe there`s a vacant room.

30:28.640 --> 30:30.107
With a razor?

30:36.114 --> 30:38.048
What time did it happen?

30:40.185 --> 30:43.018
l don`t know. At night.

30:45.957 --> 30:47.822
And then?

30:47.893 --> 30:49.451
And then--

30:49.528 --> 30:53.055
l already told you on the phone.

30:53.131 --> 30:55.065
When l found her...

30:57.435 --> 31:00.233
l called the ambulance.

31:02.474 --> 31:04.840
After your telephone call...

31:04.910 --> 31:08.311
we were awake
all night long...

31:08.380 --> 31:11.178
talking about you and Rose.

31:11.249 --> 31:13.183
And Papa talked softly...

31:15.053 --> 31:17.521
as if it happened
in our house.

31:33.238 --> 31:36.139
- Where did it happen?
- ln a room.

31:36.208 --> 31:38.836
Did she suffer?

31:38.910 --> 31:41.105
Ask the doctors
who did the autopsy.

31:42.214 --> 31:43.806
The autopsy?

32:14.412 --> 32:17.438
l already had some announcements.

32:17.515 --> 32:20.245
l`ve had enough of deaths.

32:20.318 --> 32:22.513
l think of everything.
l do.

32:22.587 --> 32:26.250
l`ll prepare
a lovely funeral chamber...

32:26.324 --> 32:27.985
with lots of flowers.

32:31.696 --> 32:34.028
The cards...

32:34.099 --> 32:36.158
the mourning clothes,
the flowers.

32:37.969 --> 32:40.096
You have everything
in that suitcase.

32:41.439 --> 32:43.407
You didn`t forget anything.

32:45.377 --> 32:47.607
But l don`t want
any priests here.

32:50.282 --> 32:51.909
Understand?

32:51.983 --> 32:54.918
You need them.
lt must be a religious funeral.

32:56.454 --> 32:58.149
Rose wasn`t a believer.

32:58.223 --> 33:00.748
Nobody believes
in a fucking God here!

33:01.960 --> 33:06.158
Paul, don`t shout.
Don`t shout like that!

33:09.501 --> 33:12.129
A priest doesn`t want
any suicides.

33:12.203 --> 33:14.433
Church doesn`t want
any suicides, do they?

33:16.141 --> 33:18.336
They`ll give her absolution.

33:18.410 --> 33:22.574
Absolution and a nice mass.
That`s all l ask.

33:22.647 --> 33:26.708
Understand? Rose--
She`s my baby girl.

33:28.286 --> 33:31.153
Why did she kill herself?

33:31.222 --> 33:32.917
Why?

33:32.991 --> 33:35.516
Why did she kill herself?

33:37.495 --> 33:38.985
Why?

33:49.507 --> 33:51.668
You don`t know, do you?

33:52.744 --> 33:54.678
You don`t know.

35:42.921 --> 35:45.856
Let`s just look at each other.

35:55.934 --> 35:58.459
lt`s beautiful
without knowing anything.

36:14.586 --> 36:16.850
Maybe--

36:16.921 --> 36:19.253
Maybe we can come
without touching.

36:21.759 --> 36:23.693
Come without touching?

36:31.669 --> 36:34.297
You concentrating?

36:34.372 --> 36:36.704
Did you come yet?

36:36.774 --> 36:38.935
- lt`s difficult.
- l didn`t either yet.

36:41.045 --> 36:42.979
You`re not trying hard enough.

36:50.255 --> 36:53.122
l shall have to invent
a name for you.

36:53.191 --> 36:55.421
A name? Oh,Jesus.

36:55.493 --> 36:58.053
Christ.

36:58.129 --> 37:02.327
Oh, God, l`ve been called
by a million names all my life.

37:02.400 --> 37:06.860
l don`t want a name. l`m better off
with a grunt or a groan for a name.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.974
You want to hear my name?

37:16.814 --> 37:19.715
So masculine.
Listen to mine.

37:26.357 --> 37:28.291
l didn`t get the last name.

38:16.975 --> 38:18.840
You shouldn`t have
done that to me.

38:20.745 --> 38:22.838
But it`s not a wig.
lt`s mine.

38:30.521 --> 38:32.079
l`m not beautiful?

38:32.156 --> 38:33.885
Tell me you don`t
like the way l look.

38:33.958 --> 38:36.153
But l do
like the way you look.

38:36.227 --> 38:39.355
Listen.

38:39.430 --> 38:43.230
You seem changed,
but you`re the same.

38:44.936 --> 38:47.302
l can already see a shot.

38:47.372 --> 38:49.897
The camera is high.

38:49.974 --> 38:52.704
lt slowly descends
toward you.

38:52.777 --> 38:55.871
And as you advance,
it moves in on you.

38:55.947 --> 38:57.881
There`s music too.

39:00.318 --> 39:04.152
lt gets closer
and closer to you.

39:04.222 --> 39:06.349
l`m in a hurry.
Let`s begin.

39:07.625 --> 39:11.391
But first we`ll
talk about it a little.

39:13.064 --> 39:15.532
Tonight we improvise.

39:15.600 --> 39:17.534
Follow me.

39:29.747 --> 39:32.307
He was my childhood friend.

39:32.383 --> 39:36.319
He would watch me for hours.
Maybe he understood me.

39:36.387 --> 39:39.550
Dogs are better than people.

39:41.726 --> 39:43.819
May l present Olympia,
my nurse.

39:43.895 --> 39:46.955
Mustapha knew how to tell
the poor from the rich.

39:47.031 --> 39:51.229
lf someone well-dressed
came in, he didn`t growl.

39:51.302 --> 39:55.636
But if it was a beggar,
you should have seen him.

39:55.707 --> 39:58.676
The colonel had him recognize Arabs
by their odor.

39:58.743 --> 40:01.507
- Olympia, open the door.
- First, give me a kiss.

40:04.782 --> 40:06.409
Go and open it.

40:06.484 --> 40:09.146
Olympia is the personification
of domestic virtue.

40:09.220 --> 40:11.654
Faithful, economic and racist.

40:14.392 --> 40:17.589
At Papa`s death, we moved
to the old country house.

40:19.497 --> 40:21.522
My childhood was
made up of smells.

40:21.599 --> 40:24.227
The mold on the walls,
the closed rooms.

40:24.302 --> 40:26.896
Many children came to play.

40:26.971 --> 40:29.838
We ran from morning to night.

40:29.907 --> 40:32.102
Growing old is a crime.

40:32.176 --> 40:35.009
That`s me.

40:35.079 --> 40:38.344
And that`s Mademoiselle Sauvage,
the teacher.

40:38.416 --> 40:40.441
Severe and religious.

40:40.518 --> 40:42.509
She was too good
and spoiled you.

40:45.189 --> 40:48.522
This is Christine.
The best friend.

40:48.593 --> 40:51.118
She`s married
and has two children.

40:51.195 --> 40:53.629
lt`s like a village here.
Everyone knows everyone.

40:53.698 --> 40:56.496
l couldn`t live in Paris.

40:58.236 --> 40:59.430
lt`s more humane here.

40:59.504 --> 41:01.404
lt`s melancholy
remembering the past.

41:01.472 --> 41:04.066
Why melancholy?

41:04.142 --> 41:06.372
lt`s marvelous.

41:06.444 --> 41:08.844
lt`s your childhood.
lt`s everything l want.

41:08.913 --> 41:11.575
And what are you doing there?

41:11.649 --> 41:14.641
Who are all these zombies
around us?

41:16.621 --> 41:18.179
The door!

41:18.256 --> 41:21.089
l`m opening the door.

41:21.159 --> 41:23.093
l`m opening the doors!

41:23.161 --> 41:26.187
- What are you doing?
- Setting up the shot.

41:27.298 --> 41:30.096
There. l found it.

41:30.168 --> 41:32.033
Reverse gear.

41:32.103 --> 41:35.072
And what are you doing here?

41:35.139 --> 41:37.664
Beat it! Scram!

41:37.742 --> 41:40.472
Yes. Reverse gear!

41:40.545 --> 41:43.207
Understand? Like a car.

41:43.281 --> 41:47.012
Put it in reverse.

41:47.084 --> 41:48.483
Close your eyes.

41:48.553 --> 41:51.681
Back up. Close your eyes.

41:51.756 --> 41:55.692
Come forward, backing up.

41:55.760 --> 41:58.490
Keep going
and find your childhood again.

41:58.563 --> 42:00.963
lt`s Papa.

42:01.032 --> 42:03.933
There. You take off
and find your childhood again.

42:04.001 --> 42:05.400
ln full dress uniform.

42:05.469 --> 42:08.097
Don`t be afraid.
Overcome the obstacles.

42:08.806 --> 42:11.604
Papa in Algiers.

42:11.676 --> 42:14.975
You are fifteen. Fourteen.

42:15.046 --> 42:17.674
Thirteen. Twelve.

42:17.748 --> 42:20.444
Eleven. Ten. Nine.

42:22.553 --> 42:24.521
My favorite street
at eight years old.

42:31.495 --> 42:33.429
My notebook.

42:36.100 --> 42:39.661
My French homework.
Theme: ''The Countryside.''

42:39.737 --> 42:43.298
Exposition: ''The country
is the home of the cows.

42:43.374 --> 42:45.638
The cow is
all dressed in leather.

42:45.710 --> 42:49.168
The cow has four sides:
front, back...

42:51.816 --> 42:53.340
top and bottom.``

42:53.417 --> 42:55.214
- lsn`t that good?
- Really charming.

42:56.287 --> 43:01.520
Source of my culture
was Larousse and l copied it.

43:01.592 --> 43:04.755
''Menstruation. Feminine noun.

43:04.829 --> 43:09.163
Physiological function
consisting in flow.

43:09.233 --> 43:11.292
Penis. Masculine noun.

43:11.369 --> 43:15.999
Organ of copulation, measuring
between five and 40 centimeters.``

43:16.073 --> 43:17.540
This is a little Robert!

43:21.746 --> 43:23.145
Look.

43:23.214 --> 43:26.149
- Who is it?
- My first love.

43:26.217 --> 43:29.584
- Who?
- lt`s my cousin Paul. The first love.

43:29.654 --> 43:32.088
- But his eyes are closed.
- What?

43:32.156 --> 43:33.680
His eyes are closed!

43:33.758 --> 43:35.692
He played piano very well.

43:35.760 --> 43:39.526
That`s how l remember him--
sitting at the piano.

43:39.597 --> 43:42.498
His fingers flew over the keys.

43:42.566 --> 43:44.693
He practiced hour after hour.

43:46.938 --> 43:49.907
At the bottom of the garden
there were two trees.

43:49.974 --> 43:53.410
A plantain and a chestnut.

43:53.477 --> 43:55.274
Sunday after mass...

43:55.346 --> 43:58.247
everyone sat under his own tree.

43:59.317 --> 44:00.784
lt was marvelous.

44:00.851 --> 44:02.876
We looked into each other`s eyes.

44:02.954 --> 44:05.821
And for me these trees
were the jungle.

44:08.626 --> 44:10.992
- What are you doing?
- We`re shitting.

44:11.062 --> 44:12.654
Why? Can`t you see ?

44:12.730 --> 44:14.925
- ln my jungle?
- Let`s run!

44:22.306 --> 44:24.240
Shoot! Shoot!

44:25.743 --> 44:27.734
Did you get everything?

44:35.453 --> 44:37.387
- Did you get it?
- Everything.

44:37.455 --> 44:41.915
Olympia was sublime. She gave
a precise idea of her racism.

44:41.993 --> 44:44.291
This really is a jungle.

44:44.362 --> 44:46.296
Tell me about your father.

44:46.364 --> 44:48.730
- Aren`t we finished?
- Five minutes.

44:48.799 --> 44:51.233
But l`m in a hurry
for work.

44:51.302 --> 44:53.429
But the colonel?

44:53.637 --> 44:58.472
The colonel had green eyes
and shiny boots.

44:58.542 --> 45:01.010
l loved him like a god.

45:01.078 --> 45:03.012
He was so handsome
in his uniform.

45:03.080 --> 45:06.481
What a steaming pile
of horseshit.

45:06.550 --> 45:09.041
What are you saying?
l forbid you.

45:12.690 --> 45:14.624
All uniforms are bullshit.

45:14.692 --> 45:16.853
Everything outside this place
is bullshit.

45:19.230 --> 45:22.461
Besides that, l don`t want to hear
about your stories about your past.

45:24.135 --> 45:27.866
He died in `58 in Algeria.

45:27.938 --> 45:30.702
Or `68 or `2 8 or `98.

45:30.775 --> 45:34.040
ln `58,
and l forbid you to joke.

45:34.111 --> 45:37.638
Why don`t you stop talking about things
that don`t matter here?

45:38.716 --> 45:40.843
What the hell`s the difference?

45:44.889 --> 45:48.154
So what do l have to say
and what do l have to do?

45:50.327 --> 45:53.455
Come on the good ship lollipop.

46:12.283 --> 46:14.717
Why don`t you go back to America?

46:24.829 --> 46:26.763
l don`t know.

46:28.432 --> 46:30.366
Bad memories, l guess.

46:34.205 --> 46:36.139
Of what?

46:42.413 --> 46:45.280
My father was a drunk.

46:48.252 --> 46:51.380
Tough, whore-fucker,
bar fighter...

46:51.455 --> 46:53.389
super masculine...

46:55.092 --> 46:58.357
and he was tough.

46:58.429 --> 47:00.363
My mother was very--

47:01.899 --> 47:04.265
very poetic.

47:04.335 --> 47:06.303
And also a drunk.

47:10.274 --> 47:15.268
All my memories
when l was a kid...

47:15.346 --> 47:17.610
was of her being arrested nude.

47:17.681 --> 47:20.241
We lived in this small town.

47:20.317 --> 47:22.808
Farming community.
We lived on a farm.

47:25.289 --> 47:27.223
And l`d come home after school...

47:30.528 --> 47:33.429
and she`d be gone...

47:33.497 --> 47:35.829
or in jail or something.

47:38.169 --> 47:40.103
And then--

47:45.876 --> 47:48.868
l used to have to milk a cow.

47:50.214 --> 47:52.682
Every morning and every night.
l liked that.

47:55.553 --> 47:57.487
But l remember...

47:58.589 --> 48:02.184
one time l was all dressed up...

48:02.259 --> 48:05.285
to go out and take this girl
to a basketball game.

48:06.864 --> 48:11.164
l started to go and my father said,
''You have to milk the cow.''

48:11.235 --> 48:15.865
l asked him,
''Would you please milk it for me?''

48:15.940 --> 48:18.340
He said, ''No,
get your ass out there.''

48:20.044 --> 48:22.274
So l went out
and l was in a hurry.

48:22.346 --> 48:26.248
Didn`t have time
to change my shoes, and l had...

48:26.317 --> 48:28.615
cow shit all over my shoes.

48:28.686 --> 48:33.020
On the way to the basketball game,
it smelled in the car.

48:34.491 --> 48:36.425
And...

48:41.265 --> 48:44.132
l don`t know, l just--

48:44.201 --> 48:47.637
l can`t remember
very many good things.

48:50.074 --> 48:52.099
Not one?

48:52.176 --> 48:54.110
Yeah. Some.

48:55.913 --> 48:58.541
There was a farmer.
Very nice guy.

48:58.616 --> 49:00.743
Old guy, very poor
and worked real hard.

49:00.818 --> 49:02.752
l used to...

49:02.820 --> 49:06.187
work in a ditch
draining land for farming.

49:07.791 --> 49:11.124
And he wore overalls
and he smoked a clay pipe.

49:13.497 --> 49:16.933
Half the time he wouldn`t
put tobacco in it.

49:17.001 --> 49:19.162
And l hated the work.

49:19.236 --> 49:21.170
lt was hot and dirty and...

49:22.840 --> 49:24.774
broke my back.

49:26.777 --> 49:29.644
All day long l`d watch his spit...

49:29.713 --> 49:34.013
which would run down the pipe stem
and hang on the bowl of the pipe.

49:35.719 --> 49:39.849
l used to make bets with myself
on when it was gonna fall off.

49:39.923 --> 49:42.221
And l always lost.

49:42.293 --> 49:44.158
l never saw it fall off.

49:45.729 --> 49:49.324
l`d just look around and it`d be gone
and a new one would be there.

49:49.400 --> 49:51.334
Then we had a beautiful--

49:53.537 --> 49:57.234
Well, my mother
taught me to love nature.

49:59.043 --> 50:01.273
And...

50:01.345 --> 50:03.472
l guess that was
the most she could do.

50:06.216 --> 50:08.980
And in front of our house...

50:09.053 --> 50:12.420
we had this big field, meadow.

50:13.657 --> 50:15.955
lt was a mustard field
in the summer.

50:16.026 --> 50:20.122
We had a big,
black dog named Dutchy.

50:20.197 --> 50:23.291
She used to hunt for rabbits
in that field.

50:23.367 --> 50:26.097
But she couldn`t see them.

50:26.170 --> 50:29.196
So she`d have to leap up
in this mustard field...

50:29.273 --> 50:33.710
look around very quickly
to see where the rabbits were.

50:33.777 --> 50:36.507
And it was...

50:36.580 --> 50:39.208
very beautiful.

50:39.283 --> 50:41.183
She never caught the rabbits.

50:41.251 --> 50:43.947
You have been had.

50:44.021 --> 50:45.352
Oh, really?

50:45.422 --> 50:51.088
l don`t wanna know anything
about your past, baby.

50:51.161 --> 50:53.288
Think l was
telling you the truth?

50:57.134 --> 50:59.068
Maybe.

51:10.013 --> 51:13.380
l`m Red Riding Hood
and you`re the wolf.

51:21.925 --> 51:24.655
Oh, what strong arms you have.

51:24.728 --> 51:27.663
The better to squeeze
a fart out of you.

51:29.433 --> 51:31.867
What long nails you have.

51:33.070 --> 51:35.538
The better to scratch your ass with.

51:40.010 --> 51:42.376
What a lot of fur you have.

51:45.282 --> 51:48.581
The better
to let your crabs hide in.

51:55.626 --> 51:59.187
What a long tongue you have.

51:59.263 --> 52:04.064
The better to stick in your rear,
my dear.

52:16.947 --> 52:18.881
What`s this for?

52:20.918 --> 52:26.379
That`s your happiness
and my ''ha-penis.''

52:26.457 --> 52:28.322
Peanuts?

52:28.392 --> 52:29.916
Schlong.

52:36.967 --> 52:38.901
Prick.Joint.

52:43.073 --> 52:44.802
lt`s funny.

52:44.875 --> 52:47.366
lt`s like playing grown-ups
when you`re little.

52:48.846 --> 52:51.246
l feel like a child again here.

52:52.382 --> 52:56.443
- Did you have fun as a kid?
- lt`s the most beautiful thing.

52:56.520 --> 53:01.014
ls it beautiful to be made
into a tattletale...

53:01.091 --> 53:05.152
or forced to admire authority or
sell yourself for a piece of candy?

53:05.229 --> 53:08.221
- l wasn`t like that.
- No?

53:08.298 --> 53:10.823
l was writing poems.

53:10.901 --> 53:14.894
l was drawing castles,
big castles with tower.

53:14.972 --> 53:16.906
A lot of tower.

53:19.343 --> 53:22.574
- You never thought about sex?
- No, no sex.

53:22.646 --> 53:25.080
- No, no sex.
- Tower.

53:26.950 --> 53:29.282
You were probably in love
with your teacher then.

53:29.353 --> 53:33.255
- My teacher was a woman.
- Then she was a lesbian.

53:33.323 --> 53:36.156
- How did you know?
- That`s classical.

53:37.327 --> 53:38.851
But anyway--

53:38.929 --> 53:41.420
My first love
was my cousin Paul.

53:43.333 --> 53:47.269
l`m gonna get a hemorrhoid
if you keep telling me names.

53:47.337 --> 53:48.964
No names.

53:49.039 --> 53:51.940
l don`t mind if you tell the truth,
but don`t give me the names.

53:52.009 --> 53:53.943
- l can`t handle that.
- Sorry.

53:58.682 --> 54:02.209
Go on and tell the truth.

54:02.286 --> 54:05.016
- What else?
- l was 1 3.

54:05.088 --> 54:07.022
He was dark, very thin.

54:08.325 --> 54:10.850
l can see him. Big nose.

54:10.928 --> 54:11.952
A big romance.

54:12.029 --> 54:16.159
l fell in love with him
when l heard him playing piano.

54:16.233 --> 54:18.895
You mean, when he first
got into your knickers.

54:18.969 --> 54:22.302
He was a child prodigy.
He was playing with both hands.

54:22.372 --> 54:24.306
l`ll bet he was.

54:26.009 --> 54:27.738
Probably getting his kicks.

54:27.811 --> 54:31.247
- We were dying of heat.
- Oh, yeah.

54:31.315 --> 54:33.545
Good excuse. What else?

54:33.617 --> 54:37.451
ln the afternoon,
when the grown-ups were napping--

54:37.521 --> 54:40.285
- You started grabbing his joint.
- You`re crazy!

54:40.357 --> 54:42.723
- Well, he touched you.
- l never let him. Never.

54:44.661 --> 54:49.291
Liar, liar, pants on fire,
nose as long as a telephone wire.

54:49.366 --> 54:51.300
You mean to tell me
that he didn`t touch you?

54:51.368 --> 54:55.304
Look me straight in the face
and say ''He didn`t touch me once.''

54:56.373 --> 54:58.841
No, he touched me,
but the way he did it.

54:58.909 --> 55:03.676
Aha! The way he did it.
Okay, what did he do?

55:03.747 --> 55:06.545
Behind the house
there were two trees:

55:06.617 --> 55:09.051
a plantain tree and a chestnut.

55:09.119 --> 55:13.078
l sat under the plantain tree
and he sat under the chestnut.

55:13.156 --> 55:16.853
And one, two, three,
we each began to masturbate.

55:16.927 --> 55:19.623
The first who came won.

55:27.037 --> 55:30.700
Why don`t you listen to me?

55:30.774 --> 55:33.538
When did you first come?
How old were you?

55:34.678 --> 55:36.839
The first time?

55:36.913 --> 55:39.780
l was very late for school.

55:39.850 --> 55:42.683
l began running downhill.

55:44.721 --> 55:47.417
Suddenly, l felt
a strong sensation here.

55:48.592 --> 55:50.890
l came as l ran.

55:50.961 --> 55:53.759
Then l ran faster and faster,
and the more l ran...

55:53.830 --> 55:55.457
the more l came.

55:57.034 --> 56:00.197
Two days later
l tried running again...

56:00.270 --> 56:02.204
but no dice.

56:07.277 --> 56:09.142
Why don`t you listen to me?

56:11.381 --> 56:14.680
You know, it seems to me
l`m talking to the wall.

56:14.751 --> 56:17.311
Your solitude weighs on me,
you know?

56:17.387 --> 56:19.412
lt isn`t indulgent or generous.

56:19.489 --> 56:22.083
You`re an egoist!

56:25.896 --> 56:28.160
l can be by myself too,
you know.

59:15.165 --> 59:17.633
We can`t sleep with this music.

59:19.236 --> 59:23.138
l came to this hotel
for one night...

59:23.206 --> 59:25.538
and stayed for five years.

59:25.609 --> 59:30.546
When we had the hotel
people came here to sleep.

59:30.614 --> 59:33.105
Now they do anything.

59:33.183 --> 59:37.950
They hide out, take drugs,
play music.

59:43.293 --> 59:45.124
Remove that hand.

59:45.195 --> 59:47.891
You`re not alone.
l`m here.

59:53.837 --> 59:55.566
You`re crazy!

59:55.639 --> 59:57.368
l`m beginning to understand.

59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.466
You want me to stop the music?

01:00:01.711 --> 01:00:02.871
Okay.

01:00:02.946 --> 01:00:04.914
l`ll make him shut up.

01:00:05.882 --> 01:00:08.248
What are you doing, Paul?

01:00:08.318 --> 01:00:12.015
What`s the matter, Mother?
Are you upset? Don`t be upset.

01:00:12.088 --> 01:00:14.022
Nothing really
to be upset about.

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:18.550
lt takes so little to make them afraid.
You wanna know what they`re afraid of?

01:00:18.628 --> 01:00:20.789
They`re afraid of the dark.
lmagine that.

01:00:20.864 --> 01:00:23.128
l want you to meet my friend.

01:00:23.199 --> 01:00:24.461
Turn on the light.

01:00:24.534 --> 01:00:27.526
You ought to meet
a few clients of the hotel.

01:00:27.604 --> 01:00:30.198
Folks, l`d like you
to say hello to Mom.

01:00:30.273 --> 01:00:33.674
Mom, this is Mr.Juicehead Junkie.

01:00:33.743 --> 01:00:36.143
And Mr. Saxophone...

01:00:36.212 --> 01:00:38.680
he`s our connection, Mom.

01:00:38.748 --> 01:00:40.682
Gives us some hard stuff.

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:45.744
And right here is the beautiful
Miss Blow Job of 1 933.

01:00:45.822 --> 01:00:49.690
She`s still making a few points
when she takes her teeth out.

01:00:49.759 --> 01:00:51.852
- Light, Paul.
- Don`t you want to say hello?

01:00:51.928 --> 01:00:54.089
This is Mom.

01:00:54.164 --> 01:00:57.099
You afraid of the dark, Mom?
She`s afraid of the dark.

01:00:57.167 --> 01:00:59.795
Oh, well, poor thing.
All right, sweetheart.

01:00:59.869 --> 01:01:04.499
l`ll take care of you. Don`t worry.
l`ll give you a little light.

01:01:04.574 --> 01:01:06.508
Don`t you worry about a thing.

01:01:12.682 --> 01:01:14.616
Let`s go back to bed.

01:01:27.831 --> 01:01:30.299
- Good night, Madam.
- Good night.

01:01:35.305 --> 01:01:37.102
Good night, Marcel.

01:01:38.174 --> 01:01:40.108
Good night, Paul.

01:01:51.454 --> 01:01:53.422
Who is it?

01:01:53.490 --> 01:01:55.219
You like?

01:01:56.393 --> 01:01:58.827
He was Rosa`s lover.

01:02:32.395 --> 01:02:35.956
What am l doing
in this apartment with you?

01:02:36.032 --> 01:02:37.522
Love?

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.033
Well...

01:02:40.203 --> 01:02:43.036
let`s say we`re just taking...

01:02:43.106 --> 01:02:46.041
a flying fuck
at a rolling doughnut.

01:02:47.177 --> 01:02:49.509
So you think l`m a ''wore.''

01:02:49.579 --> 01:02:52.514
l think you`re a what?
A what? A ''wore''?

01:02:52.582 --> 01:02:55.073
- A ''wore.''
- You mean ''whore,'' right?

01:02:55.151 --> 01:02:57.381
Yes. A whore.

01:02:57.454 --> 01:03:01.254
No, you`re just a dear
old-fashioned girl trying to get along.

01:03:04.794 --> 01:03:07.456
Why were you
going through my pockets?

01:03:07.530 --> 01:03:10.055
To find out who you are.

01:03:12.702 --> 01:03:14.636
- Yes.
- Well, if you look real close...

01:03:14.704 --> 01:03:17.764
you`ll see me
hiding behind my zipper.

01:03:19.642 --> 01:03:24.170
Well, we know that he buys clothes
in some big store.

01:03:24.247 --> 01:03:26.238
That`s not much...

01:03:26.316 --> 01:03:28.250
but it`s a beginning.

01:03:29.452 --> 01:03:31.920
That`s not a beginning.
That`s a finish.

01:03:31.988 --> 01:03:35.389
Well, okay.
Let`s forget it.

01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:36.891
How old are you?

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.894
l`ll be 93 this weekend.

01:03:38.962 --> 01:03:40.896
Oh!
You don`t look it.

01:03:40.964 --> 01:03:43.125
Thank you.

01:03:43.199 --> 01:03:45.633
- Have you been in college?
- Oh, yeah.

01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:49.104
Yeah, l went to...

01:03:50.173 --> 01:03:52.164
the University of Congo.

01:03:52.242 --> 01:03:54.369
- Studied whale fucking.
- Wow.

01:03:55.311 --> 01:03:58.246
Barbers don`t usually
go to university.

01:04:00.416 --> 01:04:03.510
Are you telling me
that l look like a barber?

01:04:03.586 --> 01:04:06.578
No, but that`s a razor`s barber.

01:04:06.656 --> 01:04:09.022
That`s a barber`s razor.

01:04:09.092 --> 01:04:11.822
Barber`s razors.
Yes.

01:04:11.895 --> 01:04:13.829
Or a madman`s.

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:20.101
So you want to cut me up?

01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:22.104
No.

01:04:22.172 --> 01:04:25.232
That would be like
writing my name on your face.

01:04:25.308 --> 01:04:27.538
Like they do to slaves?

01:04:27.610 --> 01:04:30.545
Slaves are branded on the ass,
and l want you free.

01:04:30.613 --> 01:04:32.308
Free?
l`m not free.

01:04:33.783 --> 01:04:39.119
You want to know why you don`t
want to know anything about me?

01:04:39.189 --> 01:04:41.817
- Because you hate women.
- Oh, really?

01:04:41.891 --> 01:04:44.325
What have they ever done to you?

01:04:46.563 --> 01:04:48.497
Well...

01:04:48.565 --> 01:04:51.659
either they always pretend
to know who l am...

01:04:51.734 --> 01:04:55.670
or they pretend that l don`t know
who they are, and that`s very boring.

01:04:58.241 --> 01:05:01.677
l`m not afraid to say who l am.
l`m 20 years old--

01:05:01.744 --> 01:05:04.076
No! l--
Jesus Christ.

01:05:04.147 --> 01:05:05.842
Where`s your brain?

01:05:08.918 --> 01:05:10.010
Shut up.

01:05:12.288 --> 01:05:13.880
Get it?

01:05:16.125 --> 01:05:19.561
l know it`s tough,
but you`re gonna have to bear it.

01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:23.164
You know, these sinks
are really beautiful.

01:05:24.901 --> 01:05:27.893
They`re very rare.
You don`t find them anymore.

01:05:27.971 --> 01:05:31.407
l think it`s these sinks
that let you stay together.

01:05:32.942 --> 01:05:34.876
Hmm? Don`t you think?

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:39.746
What`s that?
What`s all this?

01:05:40.917 --> 01:05:43.351
Mad? Mad? Huh?
Mad? Mad?

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.594
l think l`m happy with you.

01:05:57.267 --> 01:06:01.135
Encore! Do it again!

01:06:01.204 --> 01:06:03.138
Again!

01:06:06.276 --> 01:06:08.210
l am coming.
l am ready.

01:06:09.812 --> 01:06:11.746
Are we going together?

01:06:22.091 --> 01:06:25.822
He is a jerk.
He didn`t even say bye!

01:07:04.434 --> 01:07:06.129
What are you doing here?

01:07:06.202 --> 01:07:08.534
l`m coming. l`m flying.

01:07:08.604 --> 01:07:09.536
Stay there!

01:07:09.605 --> 01:07:12.005
Why didn`t you talk
on the phone?

01:07:12.075 --> 01:07:14.134
What`s the matter?

01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:16.144
Find another girl for your film.

01:07:17.547 --> 01:07:19.071
But why?

01:07:19.148 --> 01:07:22.311
You take advantage of me.

01:07:22.385 --> 01:07:25.479
You make me do things
l`ve never done.

01:07:25.555 --> 01:07:28.115
You`re stealing my time.

01:07:28.191 --> 01:07:31.285
You make me do
whatever you want.

01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:34.963
The film is over.

01:07:45.308 --> 01:07:47.469
l`m tired of having
my mind raped!

01:08:36.459 --> 01:08:37.790
Come in.

01:08:37.859 --> 01:08:40.886
You wanted to talk to me?
Do.

01:08:40.962 --> 01:08:46.401
But... ''l didn`t come here
to cry with you.''

01:08:46.469 --> 01:08:49.404
lt bothers you
if l keep working?

01:08:51.474 --> 01:08:53.408
lt distracts me
after what happened.

01:08:58.381 --> 01:09:00.611
ldentical.

01:09:00.683 --> 01:09:03.618
- Rose wanted them identical.
- Our bathrobes.

01:09:05.087 --> 01:09:08.318
You can`t tell me anything
l don`t already know.

01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:10.325
Same color, same design.

01:09:12.528 --> 01:09:14.462
Yes, yes.

01:09:15.531 --> 01:09:18.988
You are precise.

01:09:20.336 --> 01:09:22.997
l`m wondering why...

01:09:23.072 --> 01:09:26.564
you save
these newspaper clippings.

01:09:26.642 --> 01:09:28.734
ls it a job or a hobby?

01:09:30.313 --> 01:09:33.214
l don`t like the word ''hobby.''

01:09:33.282 --> 01:09:36.046
lt`s a job
to roll out the salary.

01:09:36.118 --> 01:09:39.314
Then it`s serious.

01:09:39.388 --> 01:09:43.620
lt`s a job that makes you read.
Very instructive.

01:09:45.161 --> 01:09:46.594
Be sincere.

01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:50.796
Didn`t you know
we had identical bathrobes?

01:09:56.305 --> 01:09:58.273
We have lots of things
in common.

01:10:02.111 --> 01:10:03.544
l know everything.

01:10:04.947 --> 01:10:08.212
Rose often told me about you.

01:10:10.553 --> 01:10:14.717
l don`t think there are
many such marriages.

01:10:16.092 --> 01:10:17.525
lt`s strange.

01:10:21.397 --> 01:10:22.830
l`m thirsty.

01:10:27.069 --> 01:10:30.061
- A sip of bourbon?
- Wait.

01:10:41.851 --> 01:10:43.443
Here`s the ''bourbon.''

01:10:49.225 --> 01:10:51.625
Another present from Rose?

01:10:53.996 --> 01:10:59.195
l don`t like it,
but Rose always wanted it around.

01:11:07.209 --> 01:11:09.268
l`ve often wondered...

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:14.315
if by these details...

01:11:14.383 --> 01:11:16.317
by certain unimportant things...

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.945
one can explain...

01:11:20.022 --> 01:11:22.547
understand together.

01:11:22.625 --> 01:11:24.183
Together?

01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:27.889
For almost a year Rose and l,
without passion...

01:11:27.964 --> 01:11:30.660
but regularly--

01:11:30.733 --> 01:11:32.963
l thought l knew her
as one can know--

01:11:33.035 --> 01:11:34.161
One`s mistress.

01:11:34.236 --> 01:11:38.764
For example,
a while ago something happened...

01:11:38.841 --> 01:11:40.502
l couldn`t explain.

01:11:44.347 --> 01:11:46.406
Look there on the wall.

01:11:48.884 --> 01:11:51.751
She climbed up on the wall...

01:11:53.389 --> 01:11:56.825
and tried to tear off the paper
with her hands.

01:11:58.995 --> 01:12:01.930
l stopped her.
She was ruining her nails.

01:12:03.933 --> 01:12:06.367
She did it with a strange...

01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:08.767
violence.

01:12:09.839 --> 01:12:12.273
l had never seen her like that.

01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:17.445
Our room is painted white.

01:12:17.513 --> 01:12:21.472
She wanted it different
from the others...

01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:23.484
so it would seem like...

01:12:24.887 --> 01:12:27.685
a normal house.

01:12:27.757 --> 01:12:31.386
She wanted to change in here too...

01:12:32.962 --> 01:12:35.396
and she`d begun with the walls.

01:12:39.869 --> 01:12:41.461
A fever blister.

01:12:41.537 --> 01:12:42.970
Shit.

01:12:46.308 --> 01:12:49.072
You were lucky enough to--

01:12:49.145 --> 01:12:51.010
to be--

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:54.140
You must have been a good man...

01:12:54.216 --> 01:12:56.150
20 years ago.

01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.754
Not as much as you.

01:13:02.024 --> 01:13:04.049
You have all your hair.

01:13:04.126 --> 01:13:08.222
l have to cut it often
and wash it.

01:13:08.297 --> 01:13:10.629
l wash my hair often.

01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:12.964
Do you have massages?

01:13:16.405 --> 01:13:18.339
You`re in good shape.

01:13:19.475 --> 01:13:22.740
What do you do for the belly?

01:13:22.812 --> 01:13:24.746
That`s my problem.

01:13:26.115 --> 01:13:28.049
Here.

01:13:28.117 --> 01:13:30.551
- l have a secret.
- What?

01:13:39.562 --> 01:13:41.792
Thinking of leaving?

01:13:41.864 --> 01:13:43.456
The suitcase.

01:13:44.633 --> 01:13:46.123
America.

01:13:46.202 --> 01:13:48.500
Why did she betray you with me?

01:13:48.571 --> 01:13:52.507
You don`t think Rose
killed herself?

01:13:56.378 --> 01:14:00.542
lt`s difficult for me, too,
to believe it.

01:14:02.485 --> 01:14:04.180
Here`s my secret.

01:14:05.454 --> 01:14:08.150
Thirty times every morning.

01:14:16.866 --> 01:14:18.128
Really, Marcello...

01:14:21.971 --> 01:14:24.906
l wonder what she ever saw in you.

01:14:29.745 --> 01:14:31.178
Are you here?

01:14:34.416 --> 01:14:35.849
Nobody here?

01:14:47.496 --> 01:14:49.088
Hi, monster.

01:15:04.013 --> 01:15:05.537
Something wrong?

01:15:05.614 --> 01:15:09.050
- There`s some butter in the kitchen.
- So you`re here.

01:15:09.118 --> 01:15:11.985
- Why didn`t you answer?
- Go get the butter.

01:15:12.054 --> 01:15:14.386
l have a cab downstairs waiting.

01:15:14.456 --> 01:15:16.390
Go get the butter.

01:15:28.604 --> 01:15:30.902
lt makes me crazy...

01:15:30.973 --> 01:15:35.410
that you`re so damn sure
that l`d come back here.

01:15:35.477 --> 01:15:37.502
What do you think?

01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:41.448
That an American
on the floor in an empty house...

01:15:41.517 --> 01:15:44.452
eating cheese and drinking water
is interesting?

01:15:47.957 --> 01:15:49.618
What`s under here?

01:15:50.526 --> 01:15:51.959
An empty space.

01:15:52.027 --> 01:15:53.289
Can you hear it?

01:15:53.362 --> 01:15:56.354
- lt`s hollow.
- Yeah. That`s a hiding place.

01:16:02.271 --> 01:16:04.831
- Don`t open it.
- Why not?

01:16:04.907 --> 01:16:08.035
l don`t know.
Don`t open it.

01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:11.341
What about that?
Can l open that?

01:16:17.052 --> 01:16:18.781
Wait a minute.

01:16:18.854 --> 01:16:20.788
Maybe there`s jewels in it.

01:16:23.459 --> 01:16:25.188
Maybe there`s gold.

01:16:28.397 --> 01:16:30.388
- You afraid?
- No.

01:16:30.466 --> 01:16:32.866
No?

01:16:36.138 --> 01:16:38.072
You`re always afraid.

01:16:40.876 --> 01:16:44.607
No, but maybe there is
some family secrets inside.

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:46.204
Family secrets?

01:16:48.584 --> 01:16:51.018
l`ll tell you about
family secrets.

01:16:53.522 --> 01:16:54.989
What are you doing here?

01:16:55.057 --> 01:16:57.992
l`m gonna tell you about the family.

01:17:03.666 --> 01:17:06.100
A holy institution...

01:17:06.168 --> 01:17:08.329
meant to breed virtue
in savages.

01:17:13.108 --> 01:17:15.542
l want you to
repeat it after me.

01:17:18.547 --> 01:17:20.481
Repeat it. Say it.

01:17:20.549 --> 01:17:22.676
A holy family...

01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:26.217
Go on, say it.

01:17:26.288 --> 01:17:31.225
Go on. Holy family.
Church of good citizens.

01:17:31.293 --> 01:17:32.726
Church...

01:17:34.964 --> 01:17:36.397
Of good citizens.

01:17:41.236 --> 01:17:43.761
Say it. Say it.

01:17:43.839 --> 01:17:47.070
The children are tortured
until they tell their first lie.

01:17:47.142 --> 01:17:48.575
The children...

01:17:49.712 --> 01:17:51.145
are tortured...

01:17:54.883 --> 01:17:58.319
Where the world is broken
by repression.

01:18:02.424 --> 01:18:03.857
Where freedom...

01:18:07.596 --> 01:18:09.894
is assassinated--

01:18:09.965 --> 01:18:12.900
Where freedom is assassinated
by egotism.

01:18:18.207 --> 01:18:19.640
Family.

01:18:22.244 --> 01:18:24.212
You...

01:18:31.253 --> 01:18:33.551
You...

01:18:33.622 --> 01:18:35.055
fucking--

01:18:36.325 --> 01:18:38.384
You fucking...

01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:40.018
family.

01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:45.525
You fucking family.

01:18:47.403 --> 01:18:48.995
Oh, God.

01:18:49.071 --> 01:18:50.504
Jesus.

01:19:30.112 --> 01:19:31.545
Shit!

01:19:35.918 --> 01:19:37.351
Hey, you.

01:19:39.254 --> 01:19:40.687
Yes, you.

01:19:42.591 --> 01:19:44.991
l`ve got a surprise for you.

01:19:46.595 --> 01:19:49.758
- What?
- l`ve got a surprise for you.

01:19:50.999 --> 01:19:52.432
That`s good.

01:19:54.136 --> 01:19:56.070
l like surprises.

01:20:09.585 --> 01:20:11.075
What is it?

01:20:11.153 --> 01:20:14.088
Music.
But l don`t know how to work it.

01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:26.834
Did you enjoy that?

01:21:05.607 --> 01:21:07.541
Know why l sent everyone away?

01:21:08.844 --> 01:21:12.336
Because you want to be
alone with me.

01:21:12.414 --> 01:21:14.678
And why?

01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:17.685
Because you have something
important to tell me.

01:21:17.753 --> 01:21:21.189
lt`s something very important.

01:21:21.256 --> 01:21:22.985
Happy or sad?

01:21:23.058 --> 01:21:24.491
lt`s a secret.

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:26.084
Then it`s happy.

01:21:26.161 --> 01:21:27.753
What kind of secret?

01:21:27.829 --> 01:21:30.730
A secret between a man...

01:21:30.799 --> 01:21:31.993
and a woman.

01:21:32.067 --> 01:21:33.830
Dirt or love?

01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:37.197
Love.
And it`s not everything.

01:21:37.272 --> 01:21:41.208
A love secret that isn`t everything?
What is it?

01:21:44.713 --> 01:21:47.307
That in a week
l`m marrying you.

01:21:47.382 --> 01:21:48.644
What?

01:21:48.717 --> 01:21:50.446
l`m marrying you!

01:21:50.519 --> 01:21:53.181
- l`m marrying you!
- Marrying me?

01:21:53.255 --> 01:21:56.190
- Let`s get married?
- Yes. Let`s get married!

01:22:02.497 --> 01:22:05.432
- Shall we marry or not?
- Yes, let`s get married.

01:22:10.272 --> 01:22:11.569
Yes or no?

01:22:20.549 --> 01:22:23.177
Send everything to the country.

01:22:23.252 --> 01:22:25.311
What do you think,Jeanne?

01:22:25.387 --> 01:22:28.288
Olympia will be happy.

01:22:28.357 --> 01:22:30.291
l went with Tom.

01:22:33.328 --> 01:22:35.558
He`s preparing a family museum.

01:22:37.366 --> 01:22:39.266
Papa`s boots, no.

01:22:39.334 --> 01:22:41.564
l`ll keep them.

01:22:42.704 --> 01:22:44.968
They give me strange shivers.

01:22:51.013 --> 01:22:55.143
These military things
never get old.

01:22:56.218 --> 01:23:00.985
How heavy it was
when Papa taught me to shoot.

01:23:01.056 --> 01:23:02.489
l`ll keep that.

01:23:02.557 --> 01:23:06.789
lt`s a good idea
to have a weapon in the house.

01:23:06.862 --> 01:23:10.195
- But if you don`t know how to use it?
- lt`s enough to have it.

01:23:10.265 --> 01:23:12.199
lt frightens.

01:23:16.905 --> 01:23:18.839
You saved everything of Papa`s.

01:23:20.175 --> 01:23:22.541
This was his orderly.

01:23:24.513 --> 01:23:26.913
A fine example of a Berber.

01:23:26.982 --> 01:23:32.181
A strong race,
but as servants-- disastrous.

01:23:33.155 --> 01:23:36.147
Send everything to the country.

01:23:36.224 --> 01:23:38.749
Enough accumulating.

01:23:38.827 --> 01:23:42.092
Don`t worry.
Soon you`ll have lots of space.

01:23:42.164 --> 01:23:44.223
What`s that mean?

01:23:44.299 --> 01:23:45.732
Nothing.

01:23:48.537 --> 01:23:52.667
Madame, the colonel`s lady,
announces...

01:23:52.741 --> 01:23:53.833
What?

01:23:56.144 --> 01:23:58.510
that in these solemn days...

01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:00.844
What solemn days?

01:24:00.916 --> 01:24:02.941
l`m getting married in a week.

01:24:04.019 --> 01:24:05.509
What did you say?

01:24:05.587 --> 01:24:07.248
To Tom! ln a week!

01:24:07.322 --> 01:24:09.756
- What?
- Tom!

01:24:09.825 --> 01:24:12.953
- ln one week!
- What are you doing in a week?

01:24:13.829 --> 01:24:15.763
Rolling.
Five... two.

01:24:19.134 --> 01:24:21.625
Come forward.
Start shooting.

01:24:21.703 --> 01:24:23.227
Yes, yes, we are coming.

01:24:23.305 --> 01:24:25.296
Wait. Push your arm.

01:24:27.209 --> 01:24:29.575
How do you see marriage?

01:24:29.644 --> 01:24:31.578
- The marriage?
- Yes.

01:24:31.646 --> 01:24:34.206
l see it everywhere.
Always.

01:24:34.282 --> 01:24:35.874
Everywhere?

01:24:35.951 --> 01:24:38.886
On walls, on housefronts.

01:24:40.589 --> 01:24:41.988
Yes, on posters.

01:24:42.057 --> 01:24:44.082
What do the posters say?

01:24:44.159 --> 01:24:46.059
They talk about cars...

01:24:46.128 --> 01:24:48.153
canned meat, cigarettes.

01:24:48.230 --> 01:24:50.755
No, the subject is
the young couple...

01:24:50.832 --> 01:24:53.198
before marriage,
without children.

01:24:53.268 --> 01:24:56.726
Then, after the marriage,
with the children.

01:24:56.805 --> 01:24:58.067
Marriage, in short.

01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:00.700
The ideal, successful marriage...

01:25:00.776 --> 01:25:02.801
isn`t anymore the old style,
in church...

01:25:02.878 --> 01:25:05.642
with a depressed
and a complaining wife.

01:25:05.714 --> 01:25:09.548
Today, the advertising marriage
is smiling.

01:25:09.618 --> 01:25:12.553
Smiling?
ln the posters.

01:25:12.621 --> 01:25:17.149
But why not take
the poster marriage seriously?

01:25:17.225 --> 01:25:19.125
Marriage.
The pop marriage.

01:25:21.396 --> 01:25:23.057
Pop.

01:25:23.131 --> 01:25:24.860
There`s the formula.

01:25:24.933 --> 01:25:28.528
For pop youth, pop marriage.

01:25:28.603 --> 01:25:32.630
And if it doesn`t work?

01:25:32.707 --> 01:25:34.402
Fix it like a car.

01:25:35.343 --> 01:25:38.710
The couple are two workmen
in overalls...

01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:40.748
repairing a motor.

01:25:40.816 --> 01:25:43.444
And in case of adultery,
what happens?

01:25:43.518 --> 01:25:47.386
lnstead of two workmen,
there are three or four.

01:25:48.623 --> 01:25:51.114
And love?

01:25:51.193 --> 01:25:52.490
ls love pop too?

01:25:52.561 --> 01:25:54.495
No.
Love is not pop.

01:25:54.563 --> 01:25:56.758
lf it is not pop,
what is it?

01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:01.497
The workmen
go to a secret place.

01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:04.664
They take off their overalls,
becoming men and women again...

01:26:04.739 --> 01:26:06.604
and make love.

01:26:19.454 --> 01:26:21.217
You`re superb!

01:26:21.289 --> 01:26:24.019
lt`s the dress
that makes the bride.

01:26:25.126 --> 01:26:27.526
You`re better
than Rita Hayworth...

01:26:27.596 --> 01:26:29.530
than Joan Crawford...

01:26:30.665 --> 01:26:33.259
Kim Novak...

01:26:33.335 --> 01:26:35.530
Lauren Bacall...

01:26:35.604 --> 01:26:39.938
Ava Gardner
when she loved Mickey Rooney!

01:26:40.008 --> 01:26:43.535
What are you doing?
Stop!

01:26:43.612 --> 01:26:46.877
Why don`t you film with the rain?
You are crazy!

01:26:57.025 --> 01:26:59.186
- Where`s Jeanne?
- She ran out.

01:26:59.261 --> 01:27:01.354
Where`d she go in this rain?

01:27:32.861 --> 01:27:34.954
Pardon me!

01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:36.964
Forgive me!

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:41.234
l wanted to leave you.
l could not.

01:27:43.838 --> 01:27:46.500
l wanted to leave you,
and l couldn`t.

01:27:46.575 --> 01:27:48.805
l can`t.

01:27:48.877 --> 01:27:50.811
l can`t leave you.
Understand?

01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:53.814
Do you still want me?

01:28:00.722 --> 01:28:02.553
Bang.

01:28:26.881 --> 01:28:30.647
Oh, there once was a man

01:28:30.719 --> 01:28:32.880
And he had an old sow

01:28:38.793 --> 01:28:40.727
You know, you`re wet.

01:29:01.349 --> 01:29:02.782
A rat.

01:29:02.851 --> 01:29:05.115
lt`s only a rat.

01:29:05.186 --> 01:29:07.620
There`s more rats in Paris
than people.

01:29:10.058 --> 01:29:11.889
- l want to go!
- Wait. Wait.

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:15.896
Don`t you want a bite first?
You don`t want to run and eat.

01:29:15.964 --> 01:29:17.693
This is the end!

01:29:17.766 --> 01:29:19.700
No, this is the end.

01:29:19.768 --> 01:29:22.931
But l like to start with the head.
That`s the best part.

01:29:23.004 --> 01:29:24.938
Are you sure you won`t have any?

01:29:25.006 --> 01:29:26.303
Okay.

01:29:30.178 --> 01:29:33.443
- What`s the matter? You don`t dig rat?
- l want to go!

01:29:33.515 --> 01:29:37.007
l can`t make love in this bed anymore.
l can`t.

01:29:37.085 --> 01:29:39.781
lt`s disgusting. Nauseating.

01:29:39.854 --> 01:29:44.553
Well, we`ll fuck on the radiator
or standing on the mantle.

01:29:44.626 --> 01:29:48.562
l gotta get some mayonnaise for this.
lt really is good with mayonnaise.

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:55.535
And l`ll save the asshole for you.

01:29:57.372 --> 01:29:59.772
A rat`s asshole in mayonnaise!

01:29:59.841 --> 01:30:03.572
l want to get out of here.
l want to go away.

01:30:03.645 --> 01:30:06.671
l can`t take it anymore here.

01:30:06.748 --> 01:30:09.012
l`m going away.

01:30:11.386 --> 01:30:14.480
l`m never coming back.
Never.

01:30:17.425 --> 01:30:19.359
Quo vadis, baby?

01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:24.194
l forgot to tell you something.

01:30:24.265 --> 01:30:26.199
l fell in love with somebody.

01:30:26.267 --> 01:30:29.430
Oh, isn`t that wonderful?
Oh, gosh.

01:30:30.672 --> 01:30:33.937
You`re gonna have to
get out of these wet duds.

01:30:34.008 --> 01:30:36.442
And l`m going to
make love with him.

01:30:39.514 --> 01:30:40.947
Well...

01:30:42.183 --> 01:30:45.118
first you have to
take a hot bath.

01:30:48.490 --> 01:30:52.426
`Cause if you don`t,
you`re gonna get pneumonia. Right?

01:30:56.364 --> 01:30:58.298
Then you know what happens?

01:30:58.366 --> 01:31:01.995
You get pneumonia, and then
you know what happens? You die.

01:31:03.271 --> 01:31:06.468
You know what happens then,
when you die?

01:31:06.541 --> 01:31:08.975
l get to fuck the dead rat.

01:31:15.250 --> 01:31:17.718
- Give me the soap.
- l`m in love.

01:31:17.786 --> 01:31:20.482
You`re in love?
How delightful.

01:31:21.556 --> 01:31:25.322
l`m in love! l`m in love!
You understand?

01:31:25.393 --> 01:31:27.554
l`m in love! l`m in love!

01:31:33.635 --> 01:31:35.569
You know, you`re old.

01:31:35.637 --> 01:31:39.437
- And you`re getting fat.
- Fat, is it? How unkind.

01:31:39.507 --> 01:31:43.910
Half of your hair is out.
The other half is almost white.

01:31:43.978 --> 01:31:48.074
ln ten years you`re gonna be
playing soccer with your tits.

01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:50.884
You know what l`ll be doing?

01:31:50.952 --> 01:31:52.977
You will be in a wheelchair.

01:31:54.088 --> 01:31:55.350
Well, maybe.

01:31:55.423 --> 01:32:00.087
But l`ll be smirking and giggling
all the way to eternity.

01:32:00.161 --> 01:32:01.594
How poetic.

01:32:01.663 --> 01:32:04.962
But, please, before you go
wash my feet.

01:32:05.033 --> 01:32:06.466
Okay.

01:32:08.136 --> 01:32:09.797
Noblesse oblige.

01:32:14.642 --> 01:32:17.907
You know, he and l, we make love.

01:32:17.979 --> 01:32:20.038
Oh, really?

01:32:20.114 --> 01:32:22.548
That`s wonderful.
ls he a good fucker?

01:32:22.617 --> 01:32:24.050
Magnificent.

01:32:26.621 --> 01:32:28.612
You know, you`re a jerk.

01:32:28.690 --> 01:32:34.094
`Cause the best fucking you`re gonna get
is right here in this apartment.

01:32:34.162 --> 01:32:35.595
Stand up.

01:32:38.199 --> 01:32:40.133
He`s full of mysteries.

01:32:41.769 --> 01:32:43.964
Give me the soap.

01:32:44.038 --> 01:32:46.563
Listen, you dumb dodo...

01:32:46.641 --> 01:32:51.044
all the mysteries that you`re ever
gonna know in life are right here.

01:32:51.112 --> 01:32:54.673
He`s like everybody,
but at the same time he`s different.

01:32:56.551 --> 01:32:58.485
You mean, like everybody.

01:32:58.553 --> 01:33:00.885
Yeah, but even he frightens me.

01:33:03.925 --> 01:33:05.859
What is he, your local pimp?

01:33:05.927 --> 01:33:09.021
He could be.
He looks it.

01:33:09.097 --> 01:33:12.362
- You know why l`m in love with him?
- l can`t wait.

01:33:12.433 --> 01:33:16.233
Because he knows how to make me
fall in love with him.

01:33:16.304 --> 01:33:19.501
Oh. You want this man that you love
to protect you and take care of you.

01:33:19.574 --> 01:33:21.166
Yeah.

01:33:21.242 --> 01:33:24.643
You want this golden,
shining, powerful warrior...

01:33:24.712 --> 01:33:28.341
to build a fortress
that you can hide in...

01:33:28.416 --> 01:33:31.874
so you don`t ever
have to be afraid...

01:33:31.953 --> 01:33:34.547
or feel lonely or feel empty.

01:33:34.622 --> 01:33:36.715
- That`s what you want?
- Yes.

01:33:36.791 --> 01:33:38.725
Well, you`ll never find him.

01:33:38.793 --> 01:33:40.886
But l`ve found this man.

01:33:40.962 --> 01:33:44.398
Then it won`t be long until he`ll
want you to build a fortress for him...

01:33:44.465 --> 01:33:47.866
out of your tits and your cunt
and your hair and your smile...

01:33:47.936 --> 01:33:49.870
and the way you smell.

01:33:51.439 --> 01:33:55.102
Someplace where he can feel
comfortable enough and secure enough...

01:33:55.176 --> 01:33:58.577
so that he can worship
in front of the altar of his own prick.

01:33:58.646 --> 01:34:00.580
But l`ve found this man.

01:34:00.648 --> 01:34:01.910
No. You`re alone.

01:34:01.983 --> 01:34:03.974
You`re all alone...

01:34:04.052 --> 01:34:07.249
and you won`t be able to be free
of that feeling of being alone...

01:34:07.322 --> 01:34:09.381
until you look death
right in the face.

01:34:09.457 --> 01:34:14.156
That sounds like bullshit,
some romantic crap...

01:34:14.228 --> 01:34:18.062
until you go
right up into the ass of death.

01:34:18.132 --> 01:34:20.066
Right up in his ass.

01:34:20.134 --> 01:34:23.297
Till you find the womb of fear.

01:34:23.371 --> 01:34:24.998
And then maybe...

01:34:26.507 --> 01:34:29.101
maybe then
you`ll be able to find him.

01:34:29.177 --> 01:34:31.111
But l`ve found this man.

01:34:31.179 --> 01:34:34.808
He`s you.
You are that man.

01:34:43.124 --> 01:34:45.115
Give me the scissors.

01:34:45.193 --> 01:34:47.718
- What?
- Give me the fingernail scissors.

01:34:55.536 --> 01:35:00.735
No. l want you to cut
the fingernails on your right hand.

01:35:00.808 --> 01:35:02.742
These two.

01:35:10.051 --> 01:35:11.643
That`s it.

01:35:16.924 --> 01:35:19.154
Put your fingers up my ass.

01:35:19.227 --> 01:35:20.319
What?

01:35:20.395 --> 01:35:23.330
Put your fingers up my ass.
Are you deaf?

01:35:25.767 --> 01:35:27.029
Go on.

01:35:31.105 --> 01:35:33.266
l`m gonna get a pig...

01:35:33.341 --> 01:35:37.004
and l`m gonna have the pig
fuck you.

01:35:37.078 --> 01:35:40.013
l want the pig
to vomit in your face...

01:35:40.081 --> 01:35:43.073
and l want you
to swallow the vomit.

01:35:43.151 --> 01:35:45.142
- You gonna do that for me?
- Yeah.

01:35:47.622 --> 01:35:51.615
l want the pig to die
while you`re fucking him.

01:35:51.692 --> 01:35:56.789
Then you have to go behind it
and smell the dying farts of the pig.

01:35:58.433 --> 01:36:01.925
- Are you gonna do all that for me?
- Yes, and more than that!

01:36:02.003 --> 01:36:04.938
And worse.
Worse than before.

01:36:14.582 --> 01:36:17.745
You look ridiculous
in that makeup.

01:36:17.819 --> 01:36:20.253
Like the caricature
of a whore.

01:36:23.357 --> 01:36:25.791
A little touch of mommy
in the night.

01:36:32.934 --> 01:36:35.698
Fake Ophelia
drowned in the bathtub.

01:36:42.844 --> 01:36:46.177
l wish you could see yourself.
You`d really laugh.

01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:50.083
You`re your mother`s masterpiece.

01:36:58.059 --> 01:37:00.323
Oh, Christ.

01:37:00.394 --> 01:37:03.830
There`s too many fucking flowers
in this place. l can`t breathe.

01:37:07.902 --> 01:37:11.235
You know, in the top of the closet,
cardboard box...

01:37:11.305 --> 01:37:13.671
l found all your--

01:37:13.741 --> 01:37:16.335
l found all your little goodies.

01:37:16.410 --> 01:37:18.344
Pens, key chains...

01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:21.875
foreign money, French ticklers...

01:37:21.949 --> 01:37:23.883
the whole shot.

01:37:25.119 --> 01:37:27.053
Even a clergyman`s collar.

01:37:28.256 --> 01:37:32.192
l didn`t know you collected all
those little knickknacks left behind.

01:37:36.230 --> 01:37:38.164
Even if a husband lives...

01:37:39.433 --> 01:37:41.424
200 fucking years...

01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:46.806
he`s never gonna be able to discover
his wife`s real nature.

01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:52.502
l might be able
to comprehend the universe...

01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:54.013
but...

01:37:56.350 --> 01:37:59.842
l`ll never discover
the truth about you. Never.

01:38:00.988 --> 01:38:03.218
l mean, who the hell were you?

01:38:05.893 --> 01:38:08.191
Remember that day...

01:38:08.262 --> 01:38:10.992
the first day l was there?

01:38:11.065 --> 01:38:15.399
l knew l couldn`t get into
your pants unless l said--

01:38:17.104 --> 01:38:19.504
What did l say?
Oh, yes.

01:38:21.242 --> 01:38:24.177
''May l have my bill, please?
l have to leave.''

01:38:25.980 --> 01:38:27.413
Remember?

01:38:31.852 --> 01:38:33.786
Last night l...

01:38:35.223 --> 01:38:38.158
l ripped off the lights
on your mother...

01:38:39.427 --> 01:38:41.691
and the whole joint
went bananas.

01:38:45.299 --> 01:38:49.497
All your guests,
as you used to call them--

01:38:53.741 --> 01:38:57.177
Well, l guess that includes me,
doesn`t it?

01:38:57.245 --> 01:38:58.906
Huh?

01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:01.448
lt does include me,
doesn`t it?

01:39:01.515 --> 01:39:05.281
For five years l was more
a guest in this fucking flophouse...

01:39:05.353 --> 01:39:07.218
than a husband.

01:39:07.288 --> 01:39:09.051
With privileges, of course.

01:39:10.124 --> 01:39:12.649
Then, to help me understand...

01:39:12.727 --> 01:39:14.888
you let me inherit Marcel...

01:39:14.962 --> 01:39:18.398
the husband`s double
whose room was the double of ours.

01:39:19.467 --> 01:39:20.957
And you know what?

01:39:21.035 --> 01:39:25.233
l didn`t even have the guts
to ask him...

01:39:25.306 --> 01:39:29.834
if the same numbers you and l did
were the same numbers you did with him.

01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:34.313
Our marriage was nothing more
than a foxhole for you...

01:39:34.382 --> 01:39:39.115
and all it took for you to get out was
a 35-cent razor and a tub full of water.

01:39:39.186 --> 01:39:42.849
You cheap, goddamn fucking,
godforsaken whore.

01:39:42.923 --> 01:39:44.857
l hope you rot in hell.

01:39:44.925 --> 01:39:50.261
You`re worse than the dirtiest street
pig anyone could find, and you know why?

01:39:50.331 --> 01:39:52.856
You know why?
Because you lied.

01:39:52.933 --> 01:39:55.868
You lied to me,
and l trusted you.

01:39:55.936 --> 01:39:57.870
You knew you were lying.

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:00.974
Tell me you didn`t lie.

01:40:02.143 --> 01:40:04.441
Haven`t you got anything
to say about that?

01:40:04.512 --> 01:40:07.913
You can think up something,
can`t you? Huh?

01:40:07.982 --> 01:40:11.076
Go on, tell me something.
Go on, smile, you cunt.

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:15.514
Go on.
Tell me something sweet.

01:40:15.589 --> 01:40:18.888
Smile at me and say
that l just misunderstood.

01:40:21.195 --> 01:40:22.719
Go on, tell me...

01:40:22.797 --> 01:40:25.857
you pig fucker.

01:40:25.933 --> 01:40:29.869
You goddamn fucking,
pig-fucking liar.

01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:41.714
l`m sorry. l--

01:40:44.518 --> 01:40:48.113
l just can`t--
l can`t stand it...

01:40:48.189 --> 01:40:52.057
to see these goddamn things
on your face.

01:40:59.767 --> 01:41:02.759
You never wore makeup,
all this fucking shit.

01:41:02.837 --> 01:41:06.102
l`m gonna take this off your mouth.

01:41:07.808 --> 01:41:09.241
Lipstick.

01:41:12.179 --> 01:41:13.612
Oh, God.

01:41:18.319 --> 01:41:19.911
l`m sorry.

01:41:21.255 --> 01:41:23.689
l don`t know why you did it.

01:41:24.959 --> 01:41:27.393
l`d do it too,
if l knew how.

01:41:28.829 --> 01:41:31.263
l just don`t know--

01:41:39.039 --> 01:41:41.337
l just have to find a way--

01:41:42.410 --> 01:41:43.843
ls somebody there?

01:41:45.479 --> 01:41:47.640
What?

01:41:47.715 --> 01:41:50.183
There is some noise there.

01:41:52.620 --> 01:41:55.555
All right, l`m-- l`m coming.

01:42:00.661 --> 01:42:02.094
l have to go.

01:42:04.165 --> 01:42:07.430
l have to go, sweetheart.
Somebody`s calling me.

01:42:13.607 --> 01:42:15.541
Then is there somebody?

01:42:15.609 --> 01:42:17.543
Yeah. l`m coming.

01:42:22.283 --> 01:42:24.444
Hurry up!

01:42:24.518 --> 01:42:26.179
Wake up!

01:42:26.253 --> 01:42:27.743
Open up!

01:42:27.822 --> 01:42:31.553
- But it`s 4:00 a.m.
- l need the usual room. Number 4.

01:42:32.626 --> 01:42:34.389
Half an hour will do.

01:42:34.462 --> 01:42:36.794
Yes, yes. Half an hour.

01:42:36.864 --> 01:42:39.799
- We`re full.
- No, indeed.

01:42:39.867 --> 01:42:43.769
When you`re full you put out a sign.
l know.

01:42:44.839 --> 01:42:48.832
l`m tired of arguing.

01:42:48.909 --> 01:42:50.274
Call the owner.

01:42:50.344 --> 01:42:54.075
Move it! The owner`s
always been helpful to me.

01:42:54.148 --> 01:42:57.743
We`re old friends, Rose and me.

01:42:57.818 --> 01:42:59.752
Open, please.

01:43:06.393 --> 01:43:09.328
Knock it off
if you don`t want me to tell her.

01:43:09.396 --> 01:43:11.330
Come in. All set.

01:43:15.536 --> 01:43:18.027
Happy? He left me.

01:43:19.106 --> 01:43:20.835
Sorry.

01:43:20.908 --> 01:43:23.843
Hurry, please.
He can`t be too far.

01:43:26.547 --> 01:43:30.779
Talk him into coming back.
Tell him this can`t be done.

01:44:15.262 --> 01:44:19.028
Please don`t say you found me.

01:44:19.099 --> 01:44:21.124
Did you see how ugly she is?

01:44:21.201 --> 01:44:23.465
Once my wife
was enough for me, but now...

01:44:23.537 --> 01:44:26.165
she`s got a disease
that gives her snake skin.

01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:29.471
- Put yourself in my place.
- Come. Come with me.

01:44:29.543 --> 01:44:31.977
Let me go.
Please let me go.

01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:39.444
You`re crazy! Let me go!

01:44:41.889 --> 01:44:45.325
Get up, you faggot!
Get the fuck out of here!

01:44:47.027 --> 01:44:48.460
Faggot!

01:46:21.321 --> 01:46:26.782
Don`t you remember the gentlemen in 4?
He`s been living here for a few days.

01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:29.021
l don`t know anyone.

01:46:29.096 --> 01:46:30.859
They come in, go out.

01:46:30.931 --> 01:46:34.196
The man in 4. The lady in 1 .
What do l know?

01:46:37.971 --> 01:46:40.906
Where`d they take the furniture?
lt`s empty.

01:46:41.875 --> 01:46:44.537
Where do you send his mail?
Give me the address.

01:46:44.611 --> 01:46:46.044
l don`t have it.

01:46:48.749 --> 01:46:50.546
l don`t know anyone.

01:46:51.585 --> 01:46:54.019
- Not even his name?
- Nothing.

01:46:56.690 --> 01:46:57.782
Miss!

01:47:08.569 --> 01:47:10.730
l found an apartment for us.

01:47:12.039 --> 01:47:13.472
1 Jules Verne Street.

01:47:15.409 --> 01:47:17.502
Yes, in Passy.

01:47:19.279 --> 01:47:22.510
Come quick.
Come right away.

01:47:23.751 --> 01:47:25.685
You understood where it is?

01:47:26.754 --> 01:47:28.688
l`ll wait for you.
Come.

01:47:51.812 --> 01:47:53.245
Come in.

01:47:55.983 --> 01:47:58.383
You like our apartment?

01:47:58.452 --> 01:48:00.511
lt`s full of light.

01:48:00.587 --> 01:48:04.523
There`s one room too small
for a big bed.

01:48:04.591 --> 01:48:06.525
Maybe for a baby.

01:48:06.593 --> 01:48:09.926
Fidel.
Nice name for a kid.

01:48:09.997 --> 01:48:11.521
Fidel. Like Castro.

01:48:11.598 --> 01:48:14.761
But l want a daughter too.
Rose.

01:48:14.835 --> 01:48:19.534
Like Rose Luxembourg. She`s not
as well known, but she`s not bad.

01:48:22.209 --> 01:48:25.144
l wanted to film you
every day.

01:48:25.212 --> 01:48:30.275
ln the morning when you wake up,
then when you fall asleep.

01:48:30.350 --> 01:48:32.545
When you smile the first time.

01:48:34.354 --> 01:48:36.379
And l didn`t film anything.

01:48:42.896 --> 01:48:45.524
Today we finish shooting.

01:48:45.599 --> 01:48:47.533
The film is finished.

01:48:47.601 --> 01:48:50.593
l don`t like things that finish.

01:48:50.671 --> 01:48:53.606
One must begin something else
right away.

01:48:58.979 --> 01:49:00.537
But it`s huge!

01:49:01.415 --> 01:49:03.440
Who are you?

01:49:03.517 --> 01:49:06.748
- You could get lost in here.
- Oh, stop it.

01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:08.811
How`d you find it?

01:49:08.889 --> 01:49:10.015
By chance.

01:49:10.090 --> 01:49:13.059
- We`ll change everything.
- Everything.

01:49:13.126 --> 01:49:15.822
We`ll change chance to fate.

01:49:15.896 --> 01:49:17.386
Come forward. Take off!

01:49:18.465 --> 01:49:20.456
You`re in heaven!

01:49:20.534 --> 01:49:23.025
Now dive!

01:49:23.103 --> 01:49:25.628
Make three turns!
Descend!

01:49:31.678 --> 01:49:33.612
What`s happening to me?
An air pocket.

01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:35.545
What`s happening to you?

01:49:38.685 --> 01:49:40.619
Enough of these turbulent zones.

01:49:41.822 --> 01:49:44.882
We can`t joke like this,
like children.

01:49:48.829 --> 01:49:51.457
- We`re adults.
- Adults? That`s terrible.

01:49:52.532 --> 01:49:54.466
Yes, it`s terrible.

01:49:57.204 --> 01:50:00.935
- Then how must we act?
- l don`t know.

01:50:01.008 --> 01:50:04.910
lnvent gestures, words.

01:50:04.978 --> 01:50:06.912
For example...

01:50:14.521 --> 01:50:16.113
One thing l do know.

01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:20.785
Adults are serious, logical...

01:50:20.861 --> 01:50:22.954
circumspect, hairy...

01:50:25.098 --> 01:50:26.861
They face all problems.

01:50:28.101 --> 01:50:31.195
Here, this apartment is not for us.

01:50:31.271 --> 01:50:34.672
Absolutely not.

01:50:34.741 --> 01:50:37.642
- Where are you going?
- To look for another.

01:50:37.711 --> 01:50:39.804
Another like what?

01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:42.075
One you can live in.

01:50:42.149 --> 01:50:44.083
But you can live here.

01:50:44.151 --> 01:50:47.587
l find this sad.
lt smells.

01:50:47.654 --> 01:50:49.918
- Come with me?
- No, no.

01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:54.359
l have to close the windows, give
back the keys, leave it all in order.

01:50:58.832 --> 01:51:00.993
Okay. Okay.

01:51:01.068 --> 01:51:02.660
Bye.

01:52:08.668 --> 01:52:10.602
lt`s me again.

01:52:11.738 --> 01:52:14.229
lt`s over. lt`s over.

01:52:14.307 --> 01:52:16.434
lt`s over,
then it begins again.

01:52:16.510 --> 01:52:20.207
What begins again?
l don`t understand anything anymore.

01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:21.770
There`s nothing to understand.

01:52:21.848 --> 01:52:23.281
We left the apartment...

01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:26.513
and now we begin again
with love and all the rest of it.

01:52:26.586 --> 01:52:28.520
- The rest?
- Yeah, listen.

01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:32.524
l`m 45. l`m a widower.

01:52:32.592 --> 01:52:34.787
l`ve got a little hotel.

01:52:34.861 --> 01:52:38.388
lt`s kind of a dump,
but it`s not completely a flophouse.

01:52:39.766 --> 01:52:42.599
l used to live on my luck.
l got married.

01:52:42.669 --> 01:52:45.069
My wife killed herself and--

01:52:46.339 --> 01:52:49.536
But what the hell.
l`m no prize.

01:52:49.609 --> 01:52:52.476
l picked up a nail in Cuba
in 1 948.

01:52:52.546 --> 01:52:56.107
Now l got a prostate
like an ldaho potato.

01:52:56.183 --> 01:53:00.119
But l`m still a good stick man,
even if l can`t have any kids.

01:53:01.721 --> 01:53:04.656
Let`s see.
l don`t have any stomping grounds.

01:53:04.724 --> 01:53:06.658
l don`t have any friends.

01:53:08.662 --> 01:53:11.130
l suppose
if l hadn`t met you...

01:53:11.198 --> 01:53:14.759
l` d probably settle for
a hard chair and a hemorrhoid.

01:53:14.835 --> 01:53:18.168
Anyway, to make a long, dull story
even duller...

01:53:18.238 --> 01:53:22.299
l come from a time when a guy like me
would drop into a joint like this...

01:53:22.375 --> 01:53:25.344
and pick up
a young chick like you...

01:53:25.412 --> 01:53:27.346
and call her a bimbo.

01:53:35.055 --> 01:53:36.989
l`m awfully sorry to intrude...

01:53:37.057 --> 01:53:39.992
but l was so struck
with your beauty...

01:53:40.060 --> 01:53:43.587
that l thought perhaps l could
offer you a glass of champagne.

01:53:43.663 --> 01:53:46.029
ls this seat taken?

01:53:46.099 --> 01:53:47.566
May l?

01:53:47.634 --> 01:53:49.568
lf you`d like to.

01:53:58.712 --> 01:54:01.647
You know,
the tango is a rite.

01:54:03.316 --> 01:54:05.113
You understand ''rite''?

01:54:05.185 --> 01:54:08.348
You must watch the legs
of the dancers.

01:54:39.019 --> 01:54:42.455
You haven`t drunk your champagne.

01:54:42.522 --> 01:54:46.686
And then l ordered you a Scotch,
and you haven`t drunk your Scotch.

01:54:57.871 --> 01:54:59.361
Now, come on.

01:54:59.439 --> 01:55:01.373
Just a sip for Daddy.

01:55:04.611 --> 01:55:07.637
Now, if you love me
you`ll drink all of it.

01:55:07.714 --> 01:55:10.148
Okay. l love you.

01:55:10.217 --> 01:55:11.946
Bravo.

01:55:12.018 --> 01:55:13.952
Tell me about your wife.

01:55:21.595 --> 01:55:23.529
Let`s talk about us.

01:55:24.965 --> 01:55:26.728
Okay.

01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:28.734
But this place is so pitiful.

01:55:29.936 --> 01:55:32.370
Yes, but l`m here, aren`t l?

01:55:33.673 --> 01:55:35.766
Mr. mâitre d`hôtel.

01:55:36.843 --> 01:55:38.777
That`s rather nasty.

01:55:39.879 --> 01:55:41.972
Anyway, you dummy, l love you...

01:55:43.283 --> 01:55:45.547
and l want to live with you.

01:55:45.619 --> 01:55:47.553
ln your flophouse?

01:55:50.857 --> 01:55:54.224
ln my flophouse?
What the hell does that mean?

01:55:54.294 --> 01:55:59.231
What the hell difference does it make if
l have a flophouse, a hotel or a castle?

01:55:59.299 --> 01:56:01.767
l love you.
What the fuck difference does it make?

01:56:25.158 --> 01:56:27.126
The jury has just chosen...

01:56:27.193 --> 01:56:30.560
the following ten best couples.

01:56:30.630 --> 01:56:33.224
Three, seven...

01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:35.894
eight, nine...

01:56:35.969 --> 01:56:38.836
eleven, twelve...

01:56:38.905 --> 01:56:42.033
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen...

01:56:42.108 --> 01:56:43.541
and nineteen.

01:56:44.978 --> 01:56:47.037
Then, ladies and gentlemen...

01:56:47.113 --> 01:56:49.411
all best wishes
for the last tango.

01:57:04.197 --> 01:57:06.131
Give me some more whiskey.

01:57:07.567 --> 01:57:09.501
l thought you weren`t drinking.

01:57:09.569 --> 01:57:12.504
But l`m thirsty now,
and l want some more drink.

01:57:12.572 --> 01:57:14.437
All right.

01:57:14.507 --> 01:57:17.442
l think that`s a good idea--
Wait a minute.

01:57:18.945 --> 01:57:21.505
Because you`re really beautiful--

01:57:21.581 --> 01:57:23.208
Wait a minute.

01:57:23.283 --> 01:57:24.716
l`m sorry.

01:57:26.152 --> 01:57:30.088
l`m terribly sorry.
l didn`t mean to spill my drink.

01:57:34.094 --> 01:57:36.255
Let`s have a toast...

01:57:36.329 --> 01:57:38.297
to our life in the hotel.

01:57:38.365 --> 01:57:40.799
No! Fuck all that.
Come on.

01:57:40.867 --> 01:57:43.165
No. Hey, listen.

01:57:43.236 --> 01:57:47.172
Let`s drink a toast
to our life in the country.

01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:50.209
You`re a nature lover?
You didn`t tell me that.

01:57:50.276 --> 01:57:51.709
l`m Nature Boy.

01:57:51.778 --> 01:57:55.339
Can`t you see me with the cows
and the chicken shit all over me?

01:57:55.415 --> 01:57:56.848
Oh, yeah.

01:57:56.916 --> 01:57:58.850
To the house of the cows.

01:57:59.986 --> 01:58:01.920
l will be your cow too.

01:58:04.324 --> 01:58:07.782
And listen,
l get to milk you twice a day.

01:58:08.895 --> 01:58:11.955
- How about that?
- l hate the country.

01:58:12.031 --> 01:58:15.364
- What do you mean?
- l hate it.

01:58:15.435 --> 01:58:17.562
l prefer to go to the hotel.

01:58:17.637 --> 01:58:19.832
Come on.
Let`s go to your hotel.

01:58:19.906 --> 01:58:23.842
Listen, let`s dance.
How about that? Let`s dance.

01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:25.844
Don`t you want to dance?

01:59:37.317 --> 01:59:39.376
Out! What are you doing?

01:59:39.452 --> 01:59:42.979
lt`s love! Always--

01:59:43.056 --> 01:59:46.116
But it`s a contest!
Where`s the love fit in?

01:59:46.192 --> 01:59:48.387
Go to the movies to see love!

01:59:52.765 --> 01:59:55.233
Oh, by God...

01:59:55.301 --> 01:59:58.532
this is the end
of our love affair, darling.

01:59:58.605 --> 02:00:00.573
Kiss this!

02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:04.076
Farewell forever.
