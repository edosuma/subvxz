WEBVTT

00:03.037 --> 00:04.038
(chuckles)

00:06.107 --> 00:07.108
(gasps)

00:12.713 --> 00:14.348
ANNOUNCER: FXX presents...

00:14.382 --> 00:17.017
It's Always Sunny
in Philadelphia.

00:18.186 --> 00:20.821
MAN:
But Miss Covington does not
govern the lady of the house.

00:21.055 --> 00:22.456
If you'll have me
as your husband,

00:22.490 --> 00:23.624
that is what you shall be.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.626
-Whoa!
-What?

00:25.659 --> 00:27.861
Oh, my God.
I did not see that coming.

00:27.895 --> 00:29.230
Well, no-- I mean,
Lord Davenforth

00:29.263 --> 00:31.065
and Anna the scullery maid?

00:31.099 --> 00:33.067
I mean, that's--
it's kind of scandalous, really.

00:33.101 --> 00:34.635
-Kind of scandalous?
-Yeah.

00:34.668 --> 00:37.138
I usually hate
this old-time British crap.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.307
-Oh, yeah.
-You know? But, like,
this-this show is amazing.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.641
-Yeah.
-It's good. It's...

00:40.674 --> 00:41.709
They actually knew
that you would love it

00:41.742 --> 00:42.910
'cause of the algorithm.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.878
-The... the what?
-(clears throat)

00:44.912 --> 00:46.747
The-the algorithm.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.249
Yeah, all of our
previously-watched shows,

00:48.282 --> 00:50.718
they go into a data bank,
so they can accurately predict

00:50.751 --> 00:52.753
which shows you'll love
moving forward.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.222
So they knew
what was gonna happen.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.324
See, the algorithm,
it takes thinking

00:56.357 --> 00:57.925
-out of the equation, basically.
-Hmm.

00:57.958 --> 00:59.760
Well, that's because math
and computers can think

00:59.793 --> 01:01.662
better for us
than we can think for ourselves.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.331
Yeah-- ooh, shut up, shut up.
I-It's decided

01:03.364 --> 01:04.498
we're watching another one.

01:04.532 --> 01:05.899
Ah, I love that
it does that, too.

01:05.933 --> 01:07.301
Another thing I don't
have to think about.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.403
You know what I mean? I-I...

01:09.437 --> 01:10.938
What I am thinking about,
though, is the fish and chips.

01:10.971 --> 01:12.106
The fish and chips.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.242
-These snacks aren't cutting it.
-Where's Frank?

01:14.275 --> 01:16.410
-I want substance.
Where is Frank?
-Need something hearty.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.146
-He supposed to be here...
-It is weird how, when
you watch stuff like this,

01:18.179 --> 01:19.480
you feel like you want
to eat like the British.

01:19.513 --> 01:20.814
CHARLIE:
Constantly want to eat like...

01:20.848 --> 01:22.250
-Cop! Cop!
-(shouting)

01:22.283 --> 01:23.917
-All right, fine.
-I'm filming this!

01:23.951 --> 01:26.086
-Hey, hey, hey. Calm down!
-I didn't do it...

01:26.120 --> 01:28.589
I came in to tell you there's
a suicidal man on the roof.

01:28.622 --> 01:29.790
He's threatening to jump.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.761
-We have nothing
to do with that!
-(all shouting)

01:33.794 --> 01:35.429
Right. Well, the police
are handling it,

01:35.463 --> 01:36.797
but I need you to sit tight.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.133
No one can enter
or exit the building

01:39.167 --> 01:41.335
until the situation is resolved.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.437
-Oh...
-Okay. Thank you, ma'am.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.506
-DENNIS: Thank you
for your service.
-MAC: Yeah, we love,

01:45.539 --> 01:46.774
-we love the police.
-Go blue.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.309
-Blue-Blue Lives Matter,
Blue Lives Matter.
-Sh-Shit, man.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.378
You guys know
what this means, right?

01:50.411 --> 01:52.045
What?

01:52.079 --> 01:53.681
We're not gonna get
our fish and chips.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.708
Shifting gears now,
we have reports

02:20.741 --> 02:23.043
of a developing situation
at Paddy's Pub.

02:23.076 --> 02:24.378
-Oh, that's us. There we are.
-Hey. All right, there we go.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.746
-We're on TV. Oh, my God.
-That's our bar.

02:25.779 --> 02:28.716
A man by the name
of Bryan O'Brien

02:28.749 --> 02:31.219
is threatening
to jump off the roof.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.586
(laughs)
"Bryan O'Brien."

02:32.620 --> 02:34.422
-(laughs)
-I'd kill myself, too,

02:34.455 --> 02:35.823
if I had that clown's name.

02:35.856 --> 02:38.226
You literally have
the name of a clown.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.393
-That's true, you do.
-All right, you know what?

02:39.427 --> 02:40.394
This is moving a little
too slow for me.

02:40.428 --> 02:41.429
Let's-let's-let's click it back

02:41.462 --> 02:42.730
-over to the show, yeah?
-Yeah!

02:42.763 --> 02:44.097
Uh, whoa, h-hold on
a second, Dennis.

02:44.131 --> 02:46.567
Uh, this guy's gonna commit
suicide off of our roof.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.501
I mean, shouldn't
we do something?

02:47.535 --> 02:49.169
-Us?
-Us do something?

02:49.203 --> 02:51.405
-Why would we...?
The cops are handling it.
-Yeah.

02:51.439 --> 02:53.006
Well, yeah, but I mean, look,

02:53.040 --> 02:55.409
if he actually goes through
with it, that's a mortal sin.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.411
I mean, maybe God is testing us.

02:57.445 --> 03:00.281
He's not gonna do anything.
This is a classic cry for help.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.082
If the guy actually
wanted to off himself,

03:02.115 --> 03:04.518
he'd hop into a warm bath
and he'd do the old...

03:04.552 --> 03:06.787
(sucks lips)
You know? North, south.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.756
-DENNIS: Hmm?
-Hmm?

03:08.789 --> 03:10.190
He'd go "down the road"
instead of "across the street."

03:10.224 --> 03:12.460
You know what I mean?

03:12.493 --> 03:14.061
-I don't know what you mean.
-I have no idea what you mean.

03:14.094 --> 03:16.397
The proper way to slit
your wrist is take a knife

03:16.430 --> 03:19.533
and, ideally, you go from
metacarpal straight to bicep,

03:19.567 --> 03:21.802
-connecting with the artery
the entire time.
-Oh, man.

03:21.835 --> 03:24.638
-Oh, you've done research.
-Ugh.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.374
-That is the most
pathetic thing, Dee.
-No, I... I-I'm not talking--

03:26.407 --> 03:27.875
we're not talking about me.
We're talking about him.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.543
-Are we not? I think we're...
-DENNIS: We are now.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.312
Okay, you know what?
The point is, I'm just saying,

03:31.345 --> 03:33.581
the man has no intention
of offing himself, all right?

03:33.614 --> 03:35.383
-This is a pathetic
attention grab.
-CHARLIE: Yeah, well,

03:35.416 --> 03:37.251
it-it doesn't matter if he wants
do or he doesn't want to.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.152
He's not gonna die
falling from that height.

03:39.186 --> 03:40.654
Whoa. Hard disagree, pal.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.557
You could absolutely die
if you jump from that height.

03:43.591 --> 03:44.825
What? Dude, it's like
three stories.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.494
It's like basic science,
you know, like...

03:46.527 --> 03:49.397
Uh, oh, I'm sorry.
Let's not bring science into it.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.564
Okay? I mean,
this is life or death.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.333
This is God's territory.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.167
-All right? I mean,
there is no science.
-All right.

03:54.201 --> 03:56.103
What do you mean-- what do you
mean "there is no science"?

03:56.136 --> 03:57.738
I mean, you were just talking
about how much you love

03:57.771 --> 04:00.474
science and math for predicting
your television shows.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.643
The-- wh-why do you not like it
in this scenario?

04:02.676 --> 04:04.077
Like, uh-- do you either
believe in science

04:04.111 --> 04:05.413
or you do not
believe in science?

04:05.446 --> 04:07.080
I am an American! I can
believe in whatever I want...

04:07.114 --> 04:08.248
-I am also an American.
Okay, though?
-...in any given moment

04:08.282 --> 04:09.950
based on what the argument
I'm trying to make.

04:09.983 --> 04:12.252
-That is not an argument.
-Okay? You are not
a true American, Charlie.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.921
-I'm more American
than you will ever be!
-You s...

04:13.954 --> 04:15.323
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Simmer down, guys.

04:15.356 --> 04:17.089
S-- just simmer down, calm down.

04:17.124 --> 04:19.427
All right?
Dee, stop being so emotional.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.329
Okay? So, guys,

04:21.362 --> 04:23.831
I think I have a way
that we can solve this argument

04:23.864 --> 04:26.500
without human emotion
mucking it all up.

04:26.534 --> 04:29.637
What we need is an algorithm.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.105
(siren wails)

04:32.139 --> 04:34.442
Now, guys, we are living in
a data-driven world, are we not?

04:34.475 --> 04:35.809
Yeah!

04:35.843 --> 04:38.712
So this is my Behavioral
Predictor algorithm.

04:38.746 --> 04:41.649
-Oh. There's words. Okay.
-Mm.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.685
-So, first we have: "Could he?"
-No way, uh-uh.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.487
-Then "Would he?"
-Nah. Cry for help.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.189
-CHARLIE: Mm-hmm.
-And "Should we?"

04:49.222 --> 04:50.558
-Yes.
-(stammers) Guys, please.

04:50.591 --> 04:51.992
Shut the hell up!

04:52.025 --> 04:53.661
I don't need your opinions.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.729
Okay? 'Cause based
on the analytical conclusions

04:55.763 --> 04:57.331
that we draw here,
we're gonna be able to come up

04:57.365 --> 04:59.733
with a mathematically-accurate,
non-emotional answer

04:59.767 --> 05:01.168
to all of our questions.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.737
Okay? We just need
to think like a computer.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.373
-CHARLIE: Oh...
-MAC: Oh.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.007
-Like a computer does.
I-I'm getting it now.
-Okay.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.210
Exactly. So why don't we start
with "Could he?" Charlie?

05:10.243 --> 05:11.379
-Okay, great. (clears throat)
-Do the thing.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.381
All right. So, what we have here

05:13.414 --> 05:16.049
is I made a little Paddy's Pub.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.518
-All right.
-Ah.

05:17.551 --> 05:18.886
DENNIS:
And-and you got
the, uh, the jumper?

05:18.919 --> 05:20.721
Uh, I do. I do.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.156
Uh, luckily I brought
an egg to work today.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.726
-Oh! Look at that guy.
-All right,
so when the guys falls,

05:25.759 --> 05:27.227
we'll be able to tell,
based on the breakage,

05:27.260 --> 05:28.662
what would happen
to the jumper when...

05:28.696 --> 05:30.230
-I think he's gonna smash.
-Y-Yeah, okay.

05:30.263 --> 05:32.833
-Here we go.
-So, he's up here
and he's saying, "Oh,

05:32.866 --> 05:36.069
-I feel so sad. Life is so..."
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh.

05:36.103 --> 05:38.071
-Yeah, Dee, what would you say
in this situation?
-DEE: Well, I don't think

05:38.105 --> 05:40.674
he's sad, I think he's happy
to get off this merry-go-round.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.910
-(inhales)
-CHARLIE: Oh, my God.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.078
-That's so pathetic.
I'd never... I would never...
-That you would know that.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.614
-You've thought about it.
-You asked me a...

05:46.647 --> 05:48.248
-You had that in the chamber.
-I'm talking about the egg.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.584
-Here he goes. "Goodbye, world."
-MAC: Goodbye.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.686
-DENNIS: Oh.
-CHARLIE: Okay.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.688
So I think he'll break a leg,
but, you know...

05:54.722 --> 05:56.123
-Mm-hmm.
-...he'll be okay.
-DEE: Hmm.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.625
If I'm being honest,
I was hoping his entire skull

05:57.658 --> 05:59.126
-would just explode.
-DENNIS: Right.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.428
I think we all were, Mac.
We were hoping

06:00.461 --> 06:01.962
-for a bit
of an explosion. Yeah.
-Uh-huh.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.131
Yeah, but I think what we
learned is that there's no way

06:04.164 --> 06:06.066
that the jumper's gonna die
from this height.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.869
You know? So there's no reason
for us to do anything about it.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.971
Uh, I don't know about that, b--
I think the problem is, is that,

06:11.004 --> 06:12.573
you know, an egg,
i-in this particular case,

06:12.606 --> 06:14.875
a-a hard-boiled egg,
it's not really

06:14.908 --> 06:17.310
an accurate representation
of-of the human head

06:17.344 --> 06:18.546
-and how it would behave
under a fall.
-Yeah, that's true.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.813
Now, Charlie,

06:19.847 --> 06:21.381
do you happen to ha--
I know you've got more eggs...

06:21.415 --> 06:22.983
-Yeah...
-Do you happen
to have an uncooked one?

06:23.016 --> 06:26.487
Ugh. No. Unfortunately,
that was the only one I found.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.489
Found? What does that mean?

06:28.522 --> 06:30.257
Goddamn it, Dee,
are you eating my egg?

06:30.290 --> 06:31.659
Well, yeah. I got hungry.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.060
-Oh...
-Uh, we never got
our fish and chips.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.328
You bitch. That was
the only one in the nest.

06:35.362 --> 06:37.397
Nest? What? Charlie,
where did you get this egg?

06:37.431 --> 06:38.932
-DENNIS: Where'd you get
the egg?
-And why are you going around

06:38.966 --> 06:41.669
stealing eggs
from goddamn nests in trees?

06:41.702 --> 06:43.837
Well, it wasn't in-in a tree,
it was in a hole.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.606
-(retching): Oh, no...
-Yeah. I mean,

06:45.639 --> 06:47.240
-it's, like, a rat's egg
or something.
-(coughs)

06:47.274 --> 06:48.976
-Can we get back to the task
at hand here? All right?
-Okay.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.578
Dee's eaten some sort
of a rat or a reptile's egg...

06:50.611 --> 06:52.245
-(Dee groans)
-...of some kind,
or whatever it is, but...

06:52.279 --> 06:53.747
-Yeah.
-...either way,
we got to find something

06:53.781 --> 06:55.749
that accurately represents
the human head, all right?

06:55.783 --> 06:57.485
Otherwise, we're not gonna get
the explosion that we want.

06:57.518 --> 07:00.454
Oh, you know what,
I might be able to get

07:00.488 --> 07:02.089
Frank's secret casaba melon.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.524
Mmm. Hmm?

07:05.993 --> 07:08.962
Why does Frank keep
a casaba melon in the safe?

07:08.996 --> 07:10.664
Hmm? I don't know,
but he flips out

07:10.698 --> 07:12.299
if I go anywhere
near the thing.

07:12.332 --> 07:13.934
Has he cut a hole in the rind,

07:13.967 --> 07:16.103
and then put it back on,
like a plug?

07:16.136 --> 07:17.938
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.973
-Yeah, there's a little...
-You guys think he's
having sex with it?

07:20.007 --> 07:21.475
-Well... yeah.
-He's definitely
having sex with it.

07:21.509 --> 07:22.643
-(phone ringing)
-Oh, that's...
-Prob-Probably is.

07:22.676 --> 07:23.944
-Yeah.
-Probably is.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.345
-Yeah.
-Hello.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.014
Hey, guess what.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.683
There's a guy stuck
on the roof of Paddy's.

07:29.717 --> 07:31.384
Oh, no, he's not stuck,
he's a jumper.

07:31.418 --> 07:34.822
A jumper? You think you could
die from that height?

07:34.855 --> 07:37.057
Uh, well, inconclusive. Yeah.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.826
We'll have an answer for you
on that real soon.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.828
Speaking of which,
we need your casaba melon.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.329
We're gonna run a smash test
on it.

07:42.362 --> 07:43.363
FRANK:
Whoa, hold it.
What, what, what?

07:43.396 --> 07:45.332
Stay away from my stuff.

07:45.365 --> 07:48.068
Don't put your hands
near my casaba.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.671
Yeah, hey, man, why do you have
a-a casaba melon in a safe?

07:50.704 --> 07:53.040
You-you banging it?

07:53.073 --> 07:55.242
It's none of your goddamn
business, Dennis.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.544
-None of your goddamn business!
-Banging it.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.045
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.180
Damn it, I got to get in there.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.181
Damn it.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.350
Dennis is touching my melon.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.252
No. I got to get in there.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.420
Sir, move back.
This area's cordoned off.

08:07.454 --> 08:08.522
There's a jumper on the roof.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.824
You don't understand.
It's my son.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.560
He's gonna do something
really stupid.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.061
I got to get in there.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.328
Oh, your son?

08:15.362 --> 08:16.730
-Yeah.
-Come with me, sir.

08:16.764 --> 08:17.965
-Okay.
-Step aside, please.

08:24.271 --> 08:25.338
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
please keep a safe distance

08:25.372 --> 08:27.407
-around the perimeter.
-All right, here we go.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.409
Oh, okay, now, I think
this is finally gonna give us

08:29.442 --> 08:30.944
that explosion
we've been craving.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.179
Well, yeah.
Now, if we see splatter,

08:32.212 --> 08:34.748
that's gonna prove that he could
die by jumping, so yeah.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.082
Okay, ready? Here we go. Five...

08:36.116 --> 08:37.585
ALL:
Four, three,

08:37.618 --> 08:40.688
two, one, ho...

08:40.721 --> 08:41.922
-DEE: Cricket!
-DENNIS: Cricket!

08:41.955 --> 08:44.091
-Cricket.
-Where did you come from?

08:44.124 --> 08:47.027
I was up on the roof
getting eggs from a nest.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.762
What the hell?
Come on, man.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.130
Yeah, yeah, well,

08:50.163 --> 08:51.799
I checked the hole,
but it was empty.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.200
-Oh, I got the one in the hole.
-The hole.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.035
Hey, you know that you guys have
a guy up on your roof?

08:55.068 --> 08:56.970
-Yeah, we know.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
There's a guy, there's a jumper.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.539
Guys, why the hell
are you wasting

08:59.573 --> 09:01.308
a perfectly good casaba melon?

09:01.341 --> 09:02.810
We're trying to figure out
if the guy could die

09:02.843 --> 09:04.544
from falling off our roof, so...

09:04.578 --> 09:06.079
Oh, no way. No.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.815
I've fallen off buildings
before; I never die.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.917
And look at me.
I'm doing great.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.652
Yeah, but you're not really
a trustworthy

09:11.685 --> 09:13.053
control group, Cricket.

09:13.086 --> 09:13.821
I mean, you know,
you're sort of subhuman

09:13.854 --> 09:14.988
at this point, you know.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.156
-For sure.
-I don't know how

09:16.189 --> 09:17.490
to squeeze that one
into the algorithm.

09:17.524 --> 09:20.327
Hey, I'm just going to, uh, take
the casaba and head on out.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.561
(all protesting)

09:21.595 --> 09:22.596
No, you're not, Cricket.

09:22.630 --> 09:23.664
-Get out of here, street rat.
-Go!

09:23.697 --> 09:25.232
-Get out! Go.
-Fine.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.334
Go get high in the bathroom,
or whatever.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.837
Cricket actually just made me
realize something.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.905
We already have data
for this situation.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.674
Maureen Ponderosa.

09:33.707 --> 09:36.644
Now, she died from falling off
a much shorter building.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.646
-Yeah, but you pushed her.
-No, no, no,
they never proved that.

09:38.679 --> 09:39.980
That was never proven.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.915
It was never even proven
that she was pushed. Okay?

09:41.949 --> 09:43.751
But it was,
I have to say, fortunate

09:43.784 --> 09:45.418
that she landed on her head,
you know.

09:45.452 --> 09:48.288
Or at least he certainly
made it look that way.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.791
-He pushed her.
-Yeah, he pushed her.

09:50.824 --> 09:51.992
No, I was following
your threads.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.794
Come on, you guys are nuts,
all right.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.763
Li-Listen, the point is,
it's all about

09:55.796 --> 09:57.297
how this guy falls, okay.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.966
'Cause if he falls feet first,
he might break a couple bones,

09:58.999 --> 10:00.100
sure, but he-he'll be fine,

10:00.133 --> 10:01.669
he'll survive,
you know what I mean?

10:01.702 --> 10:03.470
That'd be more of a cry
for help, right?

10:03.503 --> 10:04.504
-Wouldn't you say, Dee?
-Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.006
-So sad that you know that.
-Stop!

10:06.039 --> 10:08.108
But if the guy falls head first,
now that'd be a death jump.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.943
Right? So the answer
to the question

10:09.977 --> 10:11.444
"could he die from jumping?"

10:11.478 --> 10:13.613
Yeah, absolutely,
if he did a death jump.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.282
Okay, you're right.
It's how he falls.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.718
Exactly, exactly.
But the question still remains:

10:17.751 --> 10:19.720
would he jump,
would he do it at all?

10:19.753 --> 10:22.155
And for that we need to
understand his state of mind.

10:22.189 --> 10:26.026
And for that, we got to
go back to the algorithm.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.161
All right, so how does one
go about figuring out

10:28.195 --> 10:30.363
what another human being
would do?

10:30.397 --> 10:32.565
Right? How do you truly get
to know someone?

10:32.599 --> 10:34.001
-Just go through their trash.
-Sleep with them.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.568
-Oh.
-Uh, talk to their priest,

10:35.602 --> 10:36.670
then sleep with their priest.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.338
Then blackmail the priest.

10:38.371 --> 10:41.041
Then go back to the priest
and ask him to ask God

10:41.074 --> 10:43.076
to forgive you
for blackmailing him.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.678
No. No.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.413
You just, uh...

10:46.446 --> 10:49.016
We're just gonna pull up Bryan
O'Brien's social media page,

10:49.049 --> 10:50.017
and we're gonna comb
through that for any

10:50.050 --> 10:52.019
pertinent information
on his life.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.386
Okay, so from what
I'm seeing here,

10:53.420 --> 10:55.022
he looks like
a pretty normal guy.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.023
Yeah, it looks like
he likes to travel.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.524
He was recently on a cruise.

10:57.557 --> 10:59.326
CHARLIE:
Lot, lot of pictures of food.
I love that.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.728
-DEE: Oh, I love that.
-DENNIS: Oh, I love that.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.162
-CHARLIE: Don't you love that?
-'Cause I know what I ate.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.897
I don't know--
I want to know what you ate.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.398
CHARLIE:
It's a good reminder
that food is a thing.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.067
-DENNIS: Yeah, exactly. Right.
-You know what I mean?

11:07.100 --> 11:10.070
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Okay, so it looks like
he's got a lot to live for.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.172
-He's eating food.
-Mm-hmm.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.607
Or-or-or is he?

11:14.641 --> 11:17.177
Because is-- is that just what
he wants you to believe?

11:17.210 --> 11:18.411
You know, because we all know
that on the surface,

11:18.445 --> 11:21.248
social media... it's a lie.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.682
All right, so let's dig deeper,
shall we?

11:22.716 --> 11:25.418
Now, clock the amount
of baseball caps

11:25.452 --> 11:27.087
this guy's wearing,
and with the tucked-in shirts,

11:27.120 --> 11:28.588
it's a bit of a juvenile look
for a man his age,

11:28.621 --> 11:30.457
wouldn't you say?
I mean, he's hardly a child,

11:30.490 --> 11:33.093
but he's still hanging on
to his youth.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.863
That suggests to me that maybe
he's got some daddy issues.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.698
-Mm-hmm.
-Abandonment, abuse.

11:38.732 --> 11:41.134
Plus, he gave him a comical
name, like Mac's dad did.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.702
-His dad hates him as much
as Mac's dad hates him.
-That's so sad.

11:42.736 --> 11:45.806
No, my dad loves me. That...
No, my name's an homage.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.875
-No, it's not.
He really doesn't.
-My dad's name's an homage.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.977
It's an homage
to a hamburger clown.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.312
But, uh, oh, look at this,
looks like he also, uh,

11:52.345 --> 11:55.482
just got back from a cruise,
alone, to mainland Alaska. Oh.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.650
-Lame.
-Where he met himself
an edgy woman

11:57.684 --> 11:59.586
at a conference,
and she introduced him

11:59.619 --> 12:01.488
to a whole new way of life:

12:01.521 --> 12:05.092
parasailing,
Chilean wines, a tattoo

12:05.125 --> 12:07.327
of Spider-Man.
Butt-eating...

12:07.360 --> 12:09.729
Butt-eating?
Where are you getting that from?

12:09.763 --> 12:13.666
Well... there's a certain glint
in the eye, you know, a sparkle.

12:13.700 --> 12:16.003
You can see that
in someone's eye?

12:16.036 --> 12:17.004
-Oh, Dee.
-I'm asking.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.505
(gasps)

12:18.538 --> 12:20.173
-Have you been eating butts?
-CHARLIE: Of course she has!

12:20.207 --> 12:22.175
-Nasty!
-You are too much today, Dee.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.743
-I was clarifying.
-You're nasty.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.578
-Too much.
-I just was curious.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.414
But recently the girlfriend,
she's disappeared

12:27.447 --> 12:28.949
from his pictures,
which tells me that,

12:28.982 --> 12:30.750
uh, she probably broke up
with him, you know, because

12:30.784 --> 12:33.153
of all his father issues,
and 'cause he's an alcoholic,

12:33.186 --> 12:36.456
and because of the copious
requests for butt-eating,

12:36.489 --> 12:38.992
which, she was thinking
was more of a one-time thing,

12:39.026 --> 12:42.095
and he was thinking, this is
a thing now, like, from now on.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.330
You got him.
Nice work, man.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.998
-Yeah. Geez.
-That sums this guy up, I think.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.666
All right, guys,
so in summation,

12:46.699 --> 12:48.268
algorithm-wise,
what have we learned here today?

12:48.301 --> 12:50.770
-That Dee's
a nasty fucking slut.
-You are so nasty.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.472
-Okay, all right.
-You nasty!

12:52.505 --> 12:55.442
-Disgusting.
-Definitely, definitely,
but also that the poorly named

12:55.475 --> 13:00.280
Bryan O'Brien most definitely
would kill himself.

13:00.313 --> 13:03.450
-No-no-no...
-So has your son exhibited
this kind of behavior before?

13:03.483 --> 13:06.386
What? Oh, yeah,
he's a real deranged person.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.321
This kid's a real whack job.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.523
I'm afraid he's gonna do
something really stupid

13:10.557 --> 13:12.692
this time.
I got to get in there.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.661
-I can't let you do that, sir.
-But-but, look, it might've been

13:14.694 --> 13:16.329
my fault.
I mean, we had an argument...

13:16.363 --> 13:17.898
I assure you
we're doing all we can.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.833
We're trying to talk to him now.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.368
-So just stay put.
-But-but, hey...

13:21.401 --> 13:23.203
Excuse me, sir,
I'm Jackie Denardo

13:23.236 --> 13:25.005
from Channel Five News.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.440
("Alone" by Heart playing)

13:31.211 --> 13:35.849
* Oh, oh, whoa. *

13:35.883 --> 13:37.250
I hear you're the father.

13:37.284 --> 13:40.020
-I would love to interview you.
-(stammers)

13:40.053 --> 13:42.055
Baby, I'll do anything you want.

13:42.089 --> 13:45.258
My son is actually
a big fan of yours.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.694
-Oh.
-I mean, it would
really get under his skin

13:47.727 --> 13:49.897
if he knew I was
standing next to those.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.932
Uh, you. You.

13:57.704 --> 14:00.740
-(sirens wailing)
-(helicopter blades whirring)

14:00.773 --> 14:03.944
Okay, guys, now we are
on to "Should we?"

14:03.977 --> 14:06.279
Should we get involved in this
in any way?

14:06.313 --> 14:08.281
Is it our moral obligation,
as Mac says,

14:08.315 --> 14:09.749
to keep this man
from committing suicide

14:09.782 --> 14:12.185
-and going to hell...
-What-- I feel-- I don't know.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.120
I still think we just
better, like,

14:13.153 --> 14:15.022
-let the cops do their jobs.
-Mm-hmm.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.123
Mm, I don't know.
But we've already established

14:16.156 --> 14:18.591
that this guy could die
and would jump,

14:18.625 --> 14:21.094
so, I don't know, the chances
of the police getting in there

14:21.128 --> 14:23.430
in time to-to stop this guy
are, uh, pretty slim.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.265
And then we could be known
as a suicide bar,

14:25.298 --> 14:27.267
and that's no good.
I don't want to be that.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.937
Yeah, kind of grim. I'd probably
take my business elsewhere.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.471
You don't have business.

14:31.504 --> 14:34.141
Oh! What, uh, what if you
lean into that, though?

14:34.174 --> 14:36.143
Right? Like, you don't make it
grim, but you make it playful.

14:36.176 --> 14:39.913
Like, we start to name drinks
after jumpers or whatever,

14:39.947 --> 14:41.915
like, uh, The Last Call.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.150
The Jump Shot.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.584
-(gasps)
-Lemon Drop.

14:44.617 --> 14:45.919
-Right.
-Oh. There you go.

14:45.953 --> 14:47.754
Cosmo-fall-itan?

14:47.787 --> 14:49.489
-Oh!
-Very good.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.658
We could become, like,
a hot spot for jumpers.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.660
You know? We'd put their
pictures up, all around the bar

14:53.693 --> 14:55.095
-to immortalize them, you know?
-DEE: Oh, yeah.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.496
Turn them into martyrs.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.231
That's cool. And we'd play
music. We'd play music.

14:58.265 --> 15:01.101
Uh, "Highway to Hell."
"Free Fallin'."

15:01.134 --> 15:03.270
-"Free Fallin'."
Come on, man. That's...
-You know what we could do?

15:03.303 --> 15:06.406
We could lean into, like,
a-a haunted, a haunted house

15:06.439 --> 15:08.608
-kind of bar theme,
like... you know?
-Oh, well, I'm loving that.

15:08.641 --> 15:09.909
-Yeah, that'd get
my business back.
-DEE: You don't have business,

15:09.943 --> 15:11.511
-Cricket.
-You don't have business, guy.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.413
Basically, what we've concluded
is that it would actually

15:13.446 --> 15:15.482
be good for the bar
if this guy jumps and dies.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.317
Yeah? So the answer
to the question

15:17.350 --> 15:20.787
of "should we get involved?"
is... is actually yes.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.589
-Huh? Why, though?
-Yeah, but-but

15:22.622 --> 15:24.591
if-if we stop him, that would be
bad for the bar, right, Dennis?

15:24.624 --> 15:26.626
W-Well-- No, that's not
what I'm saying, though.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.996
More importantly, that's not
what the algorithm is saying.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.431
You see, we've already
established that this guy wants

15:31.464 --> 15:33.633
to die and that it would
actually benefit our bar

15:33.666 --> 15:34.834
if he dies.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.769
Now, of course,
from an emotional standpoint,

15:36.803 --> 15:38.771
we feel as though
we should get involved,

15:38.805 --> 15:40.773
we feel as though
we should save this guy,

15:40.807 --> 15:42.475
but the algorithm
is actually telling us

15:42.509 --> 15:44.511
that that does not
benefit anybody.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.013
-Hmm.
-The algorithm is telling us,

15:46.046 --> 15:48.115
mathematically, scientifically,

15:48.148 --> 15:52.185
that this guy could die,
wants to die,

15:52.219 --> 15:54.287
and that we should
help him do it.

15:54.321 --> 15:55.855
(whispers):
That's just math.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.324
-Oh.
-Hmm.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.692
Well, it still feels
a little weird,

15:59.726 --> 16:03.163
but feelings are irrelevant
in the face of facts.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.564
-Yeah.
-Is that what I'm hearing?

16:04.597 --> 16:05.999
The feelings-- feelings
just get in the way.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.734
Now, but here's-here's
the only thing, though.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.670
Like, if we were gonna do
something like this,

16:10.703 --> 16:11.871
-like...
-Mm-hmm?

16:11.904 --> 16:13.173
...you know, how would we do it?

16:13.206 --> 16:15.375
Like, in the right way?

16:15.408 --> 16:18.078
-Do we need to do another
algorithm to figure this out?
-CRICKET: Eh.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.912
-Nah, I'll push him.
-CHARLIE: Huh?

16:19.946 --> 16:21.748
What's that?

16:21.781 --> 16:23.750
Yeah. I'll push him
off the building.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.585
I don't give a shit.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.887
-This is such a difficult
situation for any parent.
-Yeah.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.890
If you could, would you like
to say anything to your son?

16:30.923 --> 16:33.693
Oh, yeah. Look, you think
you can do whatever you want,

16:33.726 --> 16:35.062
but what's mine is mine.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.696
You don't have a call.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.831
If I want to bang it,
I'm gonna bang it.

16:38.865 --> 16:41.101
Not that I am banging it,
but I could.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.503
And if it doesn't
splatter to bits,

16:43.536 --> 16:45.105
I'm gonna bang it later.

16:45.138 --> 16:47.774
(chokes):
Because it's my property.

16:47.807 --> 16:51.010
And what I do with my property
is my business.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.412
-You got that?
-I-I'm sorry to interrupt,

16:52.445 --> 16:54.013
but we have breaking news.

16:54.047 --> 16:55.448
-Eh.
-I've gotten word

16:55.482 --> 16:57.450
-the jumper is coming down.
-Oh.

16:57.484 --> 17:00.287
I've been told he found out
his estranged father is here

17:00.320 --> 17:02.289
-and he wants
to come down and talk.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's call...

17:02.322 --> 17:03.756
-He's calling me strange?
-Wait, wait...

17:03.790 --> 17:06.259
You don't know what
this sicko kid has done.

17:06.292 --> 17:08.095
Okay, Cricket, uh,
here's a broom.

17:08.127 --> 17:09.796
You probably sneak up there,
give him a little nudge,

17:09.829 --> 17:11.464
and, uh, you know,
don't let anyone see you

17:11.498 --> 17:13.266
-commit the murder.
-DENNIS: Whoa, uh...

17:13.300 --> 17:15.535
Guys, can-can
we just not call it a murder?

17:15.568 --> 17:17.104
Let's try to think of it
more analytically,

17:17.137 --> 17:19.539
more mathematically.
It's sort of like a deletion.

17:19.571 --> 17:20.906
You know? Like hitting
Control-Alt-Delete.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.541
Bloop. He's in the trash.

17:22.575 --> 17:23.742
-Oh, that's all it is, right?
-MAC: I like that.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.545
-That works for me.
-Uh-oh.
-Blip. He's gone.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.980
Breaking news right now.
Uh, there's some clarification.

17:28.013 --> 17:31.151
The jumper did not jump.
He did not jump from the roof.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.319
He is coming down the stairs.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.821
G-- oh, dude, that's...
What a gyp.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.989
-Yeah. Yeah.
-We were gonna--
we had a good plan.

17:37.023 --> 17:39.659
Can I say something, though?
I think this is for the best.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.328
Right.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.662
-You know what I mean?
-Probably.
-That's not the algorithm...

17:42.695 --> 17:44.331
-Right.
-Like, we were going down a road

17:44.364 --> 17:46.599
-I was not totally
comfortable with.
-DEE: Ooh, ooh, ooh.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.768
You guys want to go back
to watching our show?

17:48.801 --> 17:50.337
-Let's get back to our show.
-Right?
-The show.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.771
-All right.
-Why are we watching this stuff?

17:51.804 --> 17:52.905
-Okay. Yeah, okay.
-The guy didn't even jump.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.107
That's boring.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.942
Chet, what we are about
to witness here

17:55.975 --> 17:59.346
is a father being reunited with
his son after a harrowing day.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.214
-Here he is now.
-Yeah. Hey...

18:03.015 --> 18:04.484
This isn't my dad.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.585
That's not Dennis.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.087
I thought you said
you were the dad.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.257
Not of this sad sack.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.659
I'm sorry, kid.
Must've been a mix-up.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.595
I got distracted
by the reporter's bagonzas.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.964
Speaking of melons,
there's a casaba

18:17.997 --> 18:20.300
with my name on it in there.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.803
Dear Anna, our time apart only
makes my heart grow fonder.

18:23.836 --> 18:26.139
-In the dead of night...
-CHARLIE: Oh!

18:26.173 --> 18:28.007
Hey, you got our fish and chips?

18:28.040 --> 18:29.442
-Ate 'em.
-DEE: Uh...

18:29.476 --> 18:30.977
-You ate 'em?
-Wow.
-Hey, wait, wait.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.779
-Where's my melon?
Where's my casaba?
-Oh...

18:32.812 --> 18:34.614
It's right here, man. Why do you
care so much about this thing?

18:34.647 --> 18:35.848
-What is the deal?
-Ah...

18:35.882 --> 18:37.617
Yeah, what is
the deal with that?

18:37.650 --> 18:39.118
-Ugh.
-Oh.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.787
-Ah...
-Oh, God.
-Ugh!

18:40.820 --> 18:44.524
It's where I stash my Maui Kush.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.859
-You hide your weed
in a casaba melon?
-Yeah.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.661
In case the cops
ransack the place,

18:48.695 --> 18:51.864
you got to find a good,
unsuspecting spot

18:51.898 --> 18:54.167
to stash your drugs.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.868
Pot's pretty much legal now.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.069
You don't really have
to stash it anywhere.

18:57.103 --> 18:58.538
I-I don't think
you have to hide it, man.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.373
When did that happen?

19:00.407 --> 19:02.509
-Can you move?
You're blocking our show, man.
-Yeah.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.544
-Come on, man.
You're blocking the show.
-FRANK: I didn't know that.

19:04.577 --> 19:05.512
What? You're still watching
that British show?

19:05.545 --> 19:07.514
I mean, that's a bunch of crap.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.081
-It stinks.
-Uh...

19:09.115 --> 19:10.517
Uh, well, no, actually,

19:10.550 --> 19:12.685
the algorithm told us
that we like it.

19:12.719 --> 19:14.587
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah. And-and, um...

19:14.621 --> 19:16.223
-Yeah.
-I don't. You know what I mean?

19:16.256 --> 19:18.758
Like, I can't follow what
they're saying most of the time.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.393
Thank you for saying that.
I find it very boring.

19:20.427 --> 19:21.394
-Okay, now, I...
-It is boring, right?

19:21.428 --> 19:22.595
I hate the plot
because it's absurd.

19:22.629 --> 19:23.863
The plot is ridiculous.

19:23.896 --> 19:24.864
-Right? The scullery maid?
-And their teeth,

19:24.897 --> 19:26.366
I find them hard to look at.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.568
The teeth are a little bit
of a mess, but mathematically

19:28.601 --> 19:29.769
-we're supposed
to like the show.
-CHARLIE: Uh, yeah,

19:29.802 --> 19:30.937
I know, but mathematically

19:30.970 --> 19:32.439
we were supposed
to kill a man today.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.073
Maybe that's, like,
part of the problem

19:34.106 --> 19:36.909
of, like, taking the humanity
out of decisions.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.678
Perhaps the science
just isn't there yet.

19:38.711 --> 19:41.248
Hey! Where did we land
on the casaba?

19:41.281 --> 19:44.183
I-I think you can eat it, man.
I think we're done with it.

19:44.217 --> 19:45.785
-CHARLIE: Yeah, we're done.
-Yeah.
-(laughs): Oh!

19:45.818 --> 19:48.120
-Yeah, baby.
-FRANK: Eh.

19:48.154 --> 19:50.923
I wouldn't eat it, Cricks.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.626
It's full of loads.

19:56.629 --> 19:59.399

for joining the focus group.

20:42.909 --> 20:46.546
I just want to say thanks
to the suits back there
for allowing us to be here.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.215
He thinks that's
a two-way mirror.

20:49.248 --> 20:53.119
-Dee, did you just scale up
the side of the building?
-Free soloed!

20:53.152 --> 20:57.256
You gotta beef up security.
You know how easy it was for me
to get in that window?

20:59.526 --> 21:02.228
What kind of people do you think
you're gonna attract with that?

21:02.261 --> 21:05.064
