WEBVTT

00:06.131 --> 00:09.998
Everybody dies.
That's just the way it is.

00:10.135 --> 00:15.176
I'm told I'm not supposed to argue
or question or even try to understand.

00:15.306 --> 00:17.216
I'm told a lot these days.

00:17.350 --> 00:20.968
Ever since my life was snuffed out
by a toilet seat

00:21.104 --> 00:23.560
and I joined the ranks of the undead.

00:24.315 --> 00:27.601
This is Rube. He's my boss.
He's undead too.

00:27.736 --> 00:31.021
He gets the list,
who's to die, when and where,

00:31.156 --> 00:34.275
which he passes on
to the rest of us grim reapers.

00:34.409 --> 00:38.157
- This is what we look like to the living.
- Holy shit.

00:38.288 --> 00:42.332
My name is George Lass.
I take souls for a living.

00:42.459 --> 00:45.993
This was my home,
and this was my family.

00:46.129 --> 00:49.913
Dad, Reggie, Mom.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.460
They're having trouble coping.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.336
How do you know it was her?

00:53.470 --> 00:56.969
I only took one.
Do I have to go to therapy?

00:57.098 --> 01:02.722
- I don't think I'm supposed to be doing this.
- Be patient. You're learning.

01:02.854 --> 01:06.472
Decide whether the things you like
are worth sticking around for.

01:06.608 --> 01:09.443
If they are, you'll find a way to do this.

01:09.569 --> 01:12.570
- What if I don't?
- Then you go away.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074

02:17.554 --> 02:21.421
The average heart
beats about 4,300 times an hour.

02:21.558 --> 02:24.428
That's 800,000 times a week...

02:26.312 --> 02:32.517
.. 9 million times a crisp fall
and 2.77 billion beats in a lifetime.

02:35.613 --> 02:41.652
Well, what is an average heart anyway?
And how many beats do broken hearts get?

02:49.294 --> 02:52.497
If I had to chose between
being a heart or a brain,

02:52.630 --> 02:56.414
I would definitely choose a heart.
At least you do something.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.007
If you're a brain,
at the end of the day,

03:05.143 --> 03:09.093
all you're really good at
is settling for shitty situations.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.482
- Here.
- Thank you.

03:14.402 --> 03:17.154
- Where did everyone go?
- I don't know.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.522
Maybe one of them had to make a sissy.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.036
Hey, customer.

03:33.171 --> 03:38.213
Sir, please don't buy gas here.
There's another gas station down the road.

03:38.343 --> 03:42.590
This bear should be set free.
What if this was your mother in this cage?

03:42.722 --> 03:46.886
This bear is depressed
and it will die if...

03:47.018 --> 03:50.968
- Please don't buy gas here.
- Don't buy gas here, please.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.311
- What's the name?
- R Luber.

03:55.527 --> 03:59.774
You don't have to be here with me.
Do I really need a chaperone?

03:59.906 --> 04:02.397
Yeah, actually, you do.

04:02.534 --> 04:05.203
- How's your apartment working out?
- Fine.

04:05.328 --> 04:10.120
You need to get a slicker.
Shiny rubber's the best. You can hose it down.

04:10.250 --> 04:15.754
A trench is all right, but you gotta
Scotchgard the heck out of it.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.712
Do you really care
how it's going with me?

04:19.843 --> 04:23.757
Sure. I make my face look like this

04:23.888 --> 04:26.806
and the concerned words come out.

04:28.393 --> 04:31.145
So how do we know which one is Luber?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.892
A little trick I use. Who's R Luber?

04:34.024 --> 04:35.352
Slick.

04:35.483 --> 04:36.894
Who are you?

04:37.027 --> 04:40.230
Northwest Association
for the Prevention of Wild Animal Abuse.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.561
Oh, yeah?

04:41.698 --> 04:46.407
- You've never heard of Nwafpwaa?
- Yeah.

04:46.536 --> 04:50.700
You're doing a fine thing here.
I just wanna shake your hands.

04:52.250 --> 04:55.121
Thank you.
Thank you for what you're doing.

04:55.253 --> 04:58.420
Thank you so much. Come on.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.877
Good job.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.341
I get it. OK.
Yeah, thanks for nothing.

05:13.355 --> 05:16.724
You see that?
People just don't care any more.

05:16.858 --> 05:21.603
We've been here for six days.
You fucking hicks just don't give a shit!

05:21.738 --> 05:24.193
Can you get us any press?

05:24.324 --> 05:27.360
What's with the trash bag?

05:27.494 --> 05:30.993
- If there's anything you guys need...
- Cheeseburger?

05:31.122 --> 05:34.040
She's just kidding. Give us a call.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.092
Shit.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.767
- You're late.
- Sorry.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.971
You need a slicker.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.901
Now she owns that face.

06:00.026 --> 06:03.395
That's why you pop the soul
before they die.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.902
Am I really, really dead?

06:07.158 --> 06:09.032
Really, really.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.955
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I thought you were into Joni.

06:16.084 --> 06:19.535
Just to piss off my parents.
I thought you were hot.

06:19.671 --> 06:22.874
- We could have been doing it?
- Yeah.

06:27.012 --> 06:31.508
Late again,
but what am I really late for?

06:34.060 --> 06:39.268
The marketing team's latest
porn recreation of Cassie, naked,

06:39.399 --> 06:44.144
with areolas scanned from a Polaroid
of Joe's wife nursing their new baby?

06:45.655 --> 06:50.198
Frank, from E-commerce's
going-away party?

06:51.036 --> 06:55.080
Barbara's underground movement
to institute casual Fridays?

06:56.166 --> 06:58.158
One desperate attempt after another

06:58.293 --> 07:02.077
to find something in common
with someone else and then cling.

07:04.090 --> 07:07.210
"Hey, you have ten fingers?
I have ten fingers!"

07:07.344 --> 07:11.175
"Let's be friends.
We'll make rules and slogans."

07:11.306 --> 07:16.347
"If we find someone with nine fingers,
we can beat the crap out of them."

07:16.478 --> 07:19.644
It bothered me
she was in my workspace.

07:19.773 --> 07:23.189
It bothered me more that I felt
a connection for three walls

07:23.318 --> 07:29.190
and a chair that smelled like Pine-Sol
when it warmed to my body temperature.

07:29.324 --> 07:32.241
- What are you doing?
- Are you just getting in?

07:32.369 --> 07:34.242
Looks that way.

07:34.371 --> 07:37.206
The password's rimjob
if you wanna get on.

07:37.332 --> 07:41.164
I'm the system administrator.
I don't think I need a password.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.583
And you're late.

07:43.713 --> 07:48.043
What kind of universe
would give me the power to extract souls

07:48.176 --> 07:51.877
but force me to keep
a suck-ass job if I wanna eat?

07:52.013 --> 07:57.968
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just still shaken up
about the car accident.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.601
My, are you hurt?

08:03.108 --> 08:05.812
I clot fast.

08:06.945 --> 08:10.314
- Take the rest of the day off.
- Really?

08:10.448 --> 08:12.774
- Of course. Go home.
- Thank you.

08:14.077 --> 08:16.568
Why rimjob?

08:17.706 --> 08:22.332
It was the name
of my hamster growing up.

08:23.044 --> 08:27.505
My grandfather's cat was named Oddjob.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.208
Wow.

08:33.804 --> 08:37.969
I wish people were
more complicated, but they're not.

08:38.101 --> 08:43.855
Delores, am I still gonna get paid
for today if I go home?

08:43.982 --> 08:45.262
Actually...

08:47.235 --> 08:49.773
Delores lent me
her softball shirt,

08:49.904 --> 08:55.147
which wasn't so bad except that
human beings have eyeballs...

08:55.285 --> 08:57.740
- Hey.
-.. and mouths.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.575
Are you joining the Heffalumps?

09:13.261 --> 09:17.093
Maybe it was the uniform,
but it did make me wonder...

09:18.058 --> 09:20.134
.. what team was I on?

09:20.268 --> 09:23.186
And always be nice
to that lady at the DMV.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.804
I said her weave looked like carpet

09:25.940 --> 09:28.776
and my Social Security number
pulls up two bankruptcies.

09:28.902 --> 09:33.362
- See?
- Don't "see" me. That shit's a major violation.

09:33.490 --> 09:37.322
So, still loving your day job, peanut?

09:37.452 --> 09:40.204
- I don't know.
- Remind me.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.406
Office assistant.

09:43.375 --> 09:47.953
You got a whole
Breck Girl thing happening.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.045
I don't know what that means.

09:50.173 --> 09:53.672
It means you got
too much stuff on your face.

09:53.802 --> 09:58.013
- Fuckable is promotable.
- Anyone want tickets for a hockey game?

09:58.139 --> 10:00.215
- Ooh, when?
- 77.30 tonight.

10:00.350 --> 10:03.185
- Duc.
- Two tickets?

10:03.311 --> 10:06.098
And a blue line and parking pass too,
I think.

10:06.231 --> 10:09.101
- Duc.
- Who's Duke?

10:09.234 --> 10:12.852
Pierrot Le Duc.
Took a puck to the head last night.

10:12.987 --> 10:16.238
- Concussive brain injury?
- Asphyxiation.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.987
Didn't have any teeth to stop the thing.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.870
- Where did you get the tickets?
- His widow.

10:22.831 --> 10:25.618
How do you know
he doesn't have any teeth?

10:25.750 --> 10:27.410
Now, now.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.535
Reggie, are you even ready yet?

10:32.382 --> 10:34.458
- Take that off.
- Why?

10:34.592 --> 10:35.837
You know why.

10:35.969 --> 10:39.504
That's the dress
my sister wore to my funeral.

10:39.639 --> 10:43.174
- I like this.
- You have other clothes!

10:44.811 --> 10:47.516
And those are my pyjamas.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.810
Same stockings, same shoes.

11:00.577 --> 11:03.447
I don't want to have my picture taken.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.952
You're just lucky
we're not doing this with my mother.

11:09.085 --> 11:13.581
She used to make us practise smiling
in a mirror before we left the house.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.965
That's 'cause
she doesn't like your smile.

11:17.093 --> 11:21.091
- Did she tell you that?
- Yeah, she said it was fake.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.889
That bitch.

11:29.147 --> 11:32.183
Oh, yeah. See, that's so pretty.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.979
- You're gonna need a sweater.
- No, I won't.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.699
- Did you finish your homework?
- No.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.872
Oh, God.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.849
In 8th grade, Danny Burkovtold me

12:09.979 --> 12:15.354
that if you dropped a penny off
the Empire State Building, it could kill someone.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.857
That's how I feel about this.

12:17.987 --> 12:21.902
It doesn't make any sense,
but I still have to try it.

12:22.826 --> 12:28.164
Going home was fucked up,
but I couldn't help myself.

12:35.588 --> 12:40.927
I didn't give a gerbil's ass
about all this crap when I was alive.

12:41.052 --> 12:44.137
Now it all seems suddenly precious.

13:00.613 --> 13:04.445
I remember playing with this doll
in the back-yard sandbox

13:04.576 --> 13:06.533
that smelt like cat piss.

13:06.661 --> 13:10.030
I remember inviting her
to my sixth birthday party,

13:10.165 --> 13:14.079
taking her with me to
our summers in New Hampshire.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.369
We never went to New Hampshire.

13:17.547 --> 13:20.252
All right. Have you stand right there.

13:20.383 --> 13:23.420
- I prefer to be here.
- Sweetie, come right in here.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.925
You look so good. Here we go, guys!

13:26.056 --> 13:27.965
And Wheaties!

13:49.704 --> 13:53.453
I never knew much
about my sister,

13:53.583 --> 13:55.825
but I do remember she hated math.

14:01.299 --> 14:04.751
Hey, Reggie. Right here.
Come on. Give to Monty.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.962
Give to Monty.

14:07.097 --> 14:12.637
Happy, everyone. Happy.
Smile, Reggie. Smile.

14:12.769 --> 14:18.012
Before I left, I needed to
grab clean undies from my old bedroom.

14:28.493 --> 14:29.987
Shit!

14:39.045 --> 14:41.715
God bless my mom.

14:41.840 --> 14:45.837
If she ever put a bullet through
her head, it'd probably be labelled.

14:51.266 --> 14:55.310
When my parents would go out
and leave us with a baby-sitter,

14:55.437 --> 14:59.849
I would sneak into my mom's closet,
press her dresses to my face

14:59.983 --> 15:02.937
and breath her in as close as I could.

15:06.614 --> 15:11.442
But there's one smell
I didn't realise I'd miss so much.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.654
My own.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.851
Georgia, will you get off your ass
and give me a hand?

15:38.980 --> 15:41.898
- Mom?
- Don't let the cat out.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.811
Reggie, those are clean. Hang 'em up.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.437
I'll probably miss dinner.

15:49.574 --> 15:52.575
I'm glad we spent all that money
on your home office.

15:52.702 --> 15:56.118
- It's midterms.
- That Pentium whatever.

15:56.247 --> 15:58.406
Well, just let the girls use it.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.534
Whoops.

16:00.669 --> 16:03.919
- She can do her homework there.
- Nice save.

16:04.047 --> 16:06.123
My cellphone's on.

16:06.257 --> 16:08.499
Fuck.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.342
Ah!

16:20.397 --> 16:24.346
Reggie, would you please
go get that goddamn sweater?!

16:53.722 --> 16:57.636
You know the story
of the princess and the pea?

16:57.767 --> 17:00.685
It was based on my mom.

17:13.532 --> 17:16.983
I think of cats, stray cats.

17:17.119 --> 17:21.532
If you keep putting out the food,
they'll keep coming back.

17:27.088 --> 17:30.338
If thinking about your sister is painful,

17:30.467 --> 17:33.918
then you have to decide not to.

17:34.054 --> 17:38.003
It's up to you. I know you can do it.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.224
- Mom?
- Yes?

17:47.317 --> 17:50.234
I didn't know if you were still there.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.239
Do you still wear clothes?

18:12.801 --> 18:15.292
Where do you live now?

18:35.532 --> 18:37.939
Can I get ten fingers?

18:38.076 --> 18:40.152
The nails.

18:44.082 --> 18:47.118
- This is impossible.
- Sap's a bitch.

18:47.252 --> 18:51.296
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Is there some kind of trick?

18:51.423 --> 18:55.634
Do I take the tree soul and ask it
to climb itself and get the guy down?

18:55.760 --> 18:58.631
- Here.
- No way.

19:01.224 --> 19:03.300
Wow, it moved.

19:06.021 --> 19:08.309
Oh, shit.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.433
You throw like a girl.

19:12.694 --> 19:16.857
Can you take tree souls?
Do trees have souls?

19:16.990 --> 19:20.359
- Don't know.
- What about animals? Or rocks?

19:20.493 --> 19:24.277
What if you try to take a soul's soul?

19:24.414 --> 19:26.905
Don't you ever wonder about this stuff?

19:27.042 --> 19:29.330
I asked Rube once.

19:30.253 --> 19:34.749
Nice. He says that you just don't do it,
so I don't.

19:43.183 --> 19:46.137
I went home.

19:48.396 --> 19:52.264
Everybody wants to go home,
but that doesn't make it right.

19:52.400 --> 19:56.813
- Nobody saw me.
- It's not about them. It's about you.

19:56.946 --> 19:59.105
It's what you see.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.316
Swipe anything?

20:05.455 --> 20:10.615
It's tempting to think the little jewels
from our lives will bring it all back,

20:10.752 --> 20:12.875
but they don't.

20:25.517 --> 20:28.186
You can't go back.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.802
Are you gonna tell Rube?

20:33.024 --> 20:35.895
- Where's Betty?
- Baby-sitting.

20:36.027 --> 20:40.191
- I never had a baby-sitter.
- Doesn't mean you didn't need one.

20:42.325 --> 20:45.030
I'm gonna get a pet bird.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.735
- Don't get a bird.
- Why not?

20:47.872 --> 20:52.166
They're weird. I can't relate to a bird.
They're so far removed.

20:52.293 --> 20:56.587
They've got different chromosomes,
and they come from eggs.

20:56.715 --> 20:59.632
- They've got faces.
- So do cockroaches.

21:02.679 --> 21:07.555
- What are you gonna do with a bird?
- Stick it in a cage and feed it.

21:07.684 --> 21:10.851
You should at least get one you can eat.

21:10.979 --> 21:14.015
I'm gonna get a friend.
I'm not gonna eat my friend.

21:14.149 --> 21:18.811
They have brains the size of pistachios.
It's not smart enough to be your friend.

21:18.945 --> 21:24.188
You don't know that. I saw this special
on PBS called Animal Miracles.

21:24.325 --> 21:27.529
They did a dramatic re-enactment
about a guy being robbed.

21:27.662 --> 21:30.414
He had a parrot or a cockatiel.

21:30.540 --> 21:33.991
That bird lost its shit
when its owner was attacked.

21:34.127 --> 21:37.959
- It opened its cage...
- What use is a cage if it can open the door?

21:38.089 --> 21:42.502
Where else would you put it?
It opened up its cage and went crazy.

21:42.635 --> 21:47.179
Pecked out the robber's eyes,
scratched his face like he was Tippi Hedren.

21:47.307 --> 21:50.343
Don't you tell me that's not friendship.

21:53.772 --> 21:57.604
- How big was this parrot?
- I don't know. Parrot-size.

21:57.734 --> 22:01.981
A parrot can't take on a man
unless that man is a big pussy.

22:02.113 --> 22:03.987
I didn't say the parrot won.

22:04.115 --> 22:07.449
The robber stabbed it with a fork
and killed its owner.

22:07.577 --> 22:09.783
- The bird's dead.
- So why get one?

22:09.913 --> 22:13.910
It's not about homeland security,
you stupid motherfucker.

22:14.042 --> 22:16.711
I'm gonna get a friend!

22:18.672 --> 22:19.917
Jesus.

22:20.048 --> 22:23.002
She wasn't
the only one wanting a friend.

22:23.134 --> 22:25.708
So what are you gonna do now?

22:25.845 --> 22:28.965
I was kind of hoping
you were gonna tell me.

22:30.809 --> 22:33.264
You're talking to her.

22:33.395 --> 22:36.728
I mean, 'cause if you wanna
get dinner or something...

22:37.774 --> 22:42.602
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I'm not up to the bonding buddy-girl thing.

22:42.737 --> 22:44.066
OK?

22:44.197 --> 22:48.147
Hard to think what
the wrong way to take that would be.

22:48.284 --> 22:52.152
I don't wanna bond either.
I'm just hungry.

22:53.707 --> 22:55.580
Is that...?

22:55.709 --> 22:58.282
The great... whatever.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.496
Shut up.

23:40.378 --> 23:42.703
This is Bill Bright from Route 77.

23:42.839 --> 23:46.422
Controversy continues
over the decision to put down the bear.

23:46.551 --> 23:49.505
Animal Control has said
it's a matter of policy,

23:49.637 --> 23:53.172
but Dora's supporters contend that...

23:59.189 --> 24:02.889
- Are you robbing me?
- No, there's nothing to fucking rob.

24:04.027 --> 24:06.732
I was dreaming about frogs.

24:06.863 --> 24:09.781
- Real ones, or like Kermit?
- Real ones.

24:11.159 --> 24:13.448
I saw a movie about frogs.

24:13.578 --> 24:16.781
They got pissed and ate
some people on an island.

24:16.915 --> 24:20.284
- I think it was called Frogs.
- Were they bad people?

24:20.418 --> 24:22.625
No, they littered or something.

24:22.754 --> 24:25.506
I only like it when bad people die.

24:25.632 --> 24:30.009
I like it when nobody dies,
so I don't have to work.

24:30.553 --> 24:34.681
- What would happen if everybody died?
- What do you mean?

24:35.392 --> 24:38.392
Like if we were the only ones left?

24:38.520 --> 24:39.599
Oh...

24:39.729 --> 24:43.561
You mean like if the frogs
ate everyone on the planet?

24:44.901 --> 24:45.932
Yeah.

24:46.069 --> 24:49.402
I reckon we'd be shovelling
a lot of frog shit.

24:49.531 --> 24:52.235
Did you shovel frog shit in your dream?

24:52.367 --> 24:54.443
No.

24:55.120 --> 24:59.947
A frog was carrying me on his back
over a river of lava.

25:01.376 --> 25:03.499
A frog?

25:03.628 --> 25:05.835
Yeah.

25:08.174 --> 25:10.250
I have to go.

25:12.470 --> 25:14.048
I've got a business meeting.

25:14.180 --> 25:18.048
Got to get our ducks in a row,
fine-tune the language.

25:21.771 --> 25:24.262
You should do something with this place.

25:24.399 --> 25:27.104
I've been in crack houses
with more style.

25:27.235 --> 25:29.393
- Do you need this back?
- No.

25:29.529 --> 25:31.985
Cheers.

25:44.961 --> 25:47.997
Hello. Hi.
I don't know if you got the e-mail,

25:48.131 --> 25:50.373
but Harry F is moving to Corporate.

25:50.508 --> 25:52.667
We're all meeting in here for cake.

25:52.802 --> 25:56.717
I'm sure they put
mind-control drugs in the water,

25:56.848 --> 25:58.971
because I'm actually excited.

25:59.100 --> 26:02.765
- Can you cover the phones?
- Oh.

26:02.896 --> 26:07.890
The main line will ring through
to your extension, OK?

26:08.026 --> 26:10.102
Yeah.

26:15.116 --> 26:19.992
Little moments like that prove that
there is some kind of all-powerful force

26:20.121 --> 26:23.122
that controls
everything in the universe,

26:23.249 --> 26:26.334
and it's so bored, it'll take time out...

26:26.461 --> 26:29.628
to orchestrate
a petty letdown like that.

26:30.715 --> 26:34.843
It's not that I even cared
about the cake or the conversation.

26:34.969 --> 26:38.220
The latest Java patch
is completely kick-ass.

26:39.557 --> 26:42.048
But standing outside all that bullshit,

26:42.185 --> 26:47.808
I started to realise how warm and safe
that bullshit might actually feel.

26:51.486 --> 26:56.231
The sad thing is that you can't find
a more original way to act out.

26:56.366 --> 26:59.153
I don't have the television.

26:59.285 --> 27:05.454
If you're testing me, you're gonna lose.
You can set the car on fire, eat the cat.

27:05.583 --> 27:09.202
I will not give you extra attention
because you won't let go.

27:09.337 --> 27:11.828
If there's any poetry
to being a reaper,

27:11.965 --> 27:15.548
it's in combining taking souls
with making money.

27:15.677 --> 27:19.377
If you're self-aware too,
you're the Walt fucking Whitman of reapers.

27:19.514 --> 27:23.464
When you deliver criticism,
are you direct or tactful?

27:23.601 --> 27:27.101
- I'm not telling the truth.
- Tactful.

27:27.230 --> 27:32.437
You consider yourself to be
exceptionally reasonable or exceptionally kind?

27:33.486 --> 27:35.443
Exceptionally kind.

27:36.197 --> 27:40.277
- Well, I'm not particularly reasonable.
- Fine. Kind. Me too.

27:40.410 --> 27:43.577
Do you tend to see the trees or the forest?

27:43.705 --> 27:46.196
- How many trees?
- How many do you want?

27:46.332 --> 27:49.369
In Chinese
there's this symbol like a tree.

27:49.502 --> 27:53.085
It means tree,
but if there are two it means forest.

27:55.425 --> 27:56.504
Uh...

27:56.634 --> 27:58.592
Trees.

27:59.429 --> 28:01.920
- Why, what do you see?
- The forest.

28:06.394 --> 28:08.470
How do I look? Ready?

28:09.606 --> 28:12.227
- Swarthy.
- Is that good?

28:12.359 --> 28:15.359
- Depends if you like swarthy.
- Do you like swarthy?

28:15.487 --> 28:17.563
Not particularly.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.821
OK.

28:31.002 --> 28:33.576
Don't put me down as trees, OK?

28:33.713 --> 28:35.789
OK.

29:02.117 --> 29:04.193
Give me that damn bag!

29:07.038 --> 29:11.202
You're an NF. You're an intuitive feeler.
You trust your intuition.

29:11.334 --> 29:14.501
You yearn for romance
and prize meaningful relationships.

29:14.629 --> 29:16.669
What?

29:17.340 --> 29:20.127
I bet he's an intuitive thinker.

29:21.177 --> 29:23.799
NTs are the worst.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.889
I'll take that. Cheers!

29:47.078 --> 29:49.154
Excuse me, Mr Dead Guy.

29:51.124 --> 29:54.160
On an airplane,
if you're seated next to someone,

29:54.294 --> 29:57.129
do you make conversation
or read a book?

29:57.255 --> 29:59.960
One soul and $1,400 later, it was time for lunch.

30:00.091 --> 30:03.009
They wouldn't even let me talk
to a human being.

30:03.136 --> 30:06.635
- I'm gonna change banks.
- You have to press 0.

30:06.765 --> 30:11.012
- You don't think I know to press 0?
- Sometimes it's star.

30:12.187 --> 30:15.022
Computers are gonna
take over the whole world.

30:15.148 --> 30:18.564
Never happen.
Computers won't get smarter than people.

30:18.693 --> 30:20.104
They already are.

30:20.236 --> 30:23.522
When a computer loses it
with a meter maid, no offence,

30:23.656 --> 30:29.529
or kills itself 'cause it thinks it's too fat,
then I'll believe in artificial intelligence.

30:29.662 --> 30:31.988
This juice tastes funny.

30:35.543 --> 30:37.417
Tastes like Fresca.

30:43.468 --> 30:45.425
Hi.

30:50.266 --> 30:54.050
- Know what you want?
- Yeah, Banana Bonanza...

30:54.187 --> 30:56.725
I heard you went home again.

30:57.649 --> 31:00.318
- Wheat toast.
- Big fucking mistake.

31:00.443 --> 31:03.943
- And a glass of water.
- I'm a reasonable man, George.

31:05.156 --> 31:07.232
I'll come back.

31:11.162 --> 31:13.653
I'm a reasonable man, George...

31:14.624 --> 31:18.040
.. even though you flip me off.

31:19.337 --> 31:20.535
Um...

31:22.465 --> 31:27.756
You frustrate me. If I hear you have
any contact with your old life again,

31:27.887 --> 31:31.885
you will have a torment
come down upon you that you cannot imagine.

31:32.017 --> 31:34.139
Check, please.

31:36.438 --> 31:39.641
I know that's supposed to scare me,

31:39.774 --> 31:43.724
but I can't think
of anything you could do

31:43.862 --> 31:47.562
that's any worse
than what's already happened.

31:47.699 --> 31:50.272
I was only joking. I'm sorry.

31:51.494 --> 31:55.077
- We'll take it.
- Could you add a grapefruit juice?

31:55.206 --> 31:56.831
- She's gotta go back.
- And?

31:56.958 --> 32:00.125
So you get it to go
on your way out.

32:00.253 --> 32:02.495
Has anyone got two fives?

32:02.630 --> 32:05.418
- Could you cover me?
- Yes.

32:05.550 --> 32:07.590
This is for you.

32:07.719 --> 32:10.127
And you.

32:10.263 --> 32:12.256
And you. And you.

32:13.516 --> 32:17.728
- Again?
- Here you go.

32:17.854 --> 32:20.060
You give her a ride.

32:42.712 --> 32:45.382
They're still waiting for confirmation

32:45.507 --> 32:49.456
that the tranquilliser
used to sedate Dora has taken effect.

32:49.594 --> 32:53.426
When that happens, the plan is
to move her into that trailer,

32:53.556 --> 32:56.641
where she will make the ride
to the folding hacility.

32:56.768 --> 32:58.761
Fuck. Sorry.

33:00.146 --> 33:03.100
All right. Holding facility.

33:04.150 --> 33:09.489
Go again. Chris. Ally.
They're still waiting for the tranquilliser...

33:19.958 --> 33:22.959
So... what's your guess?

33:29.259 --> 33:31.928
How do you think it's gonna happen?

33:36.599 --> 33:40.680
Professor in the library with the candlestick?

33:46.359 --> 33:49.977
Brake on the truck fails,
the truck runs into the gas pumps

33:50.113 --> 33:54.656
as the antenna tower
sparks the lights on the canopy.

33:54.784 --> 34:00.241
- Is it a reaper thing to take the long shot?
- I could be getting something done today.

34:00.373 --> 34:03.742
There's a man in a cage
with a barely sedated bear.

34:03.877 --> 34:06.083
V Kostakovich.

34:08.297 --> 34:10.005
What?

34:16.889 --> 34:19.511
It's not impossible.

34:28.360 --> 34:32.357
Whether that support is enough
to prevent Dora from being put down

34:32.489 --> 34:33.947
remains to be seen.

34:34.074 --> 34:37.193
This is Bill Bright
reporting from Route 77.

34:37.327 --> 34:39.201
Got it. Nice job.

34:41.414 --> 34:45.458
- What time is it?
- You smell like garbage.

34:45.585 --> 34:48.158
It's such a relief
when I get to my name.

34:48.295 --> 34:52.460
- It's hard to mess up Bill Bright.
- You should hear my real name.

34:52.592 --> 34:54.715
Kostakovich!

34:59.432 --> 35:02.433
- Roll tape, roll tape.
- We're rolling.

35:02.560 --> 35:07.222
What started as a simple protest
has escalated into a dangerous situation.

35:07.357 --> 35:09.978
This is Bill Bright
reporting from Route 77.

35:10.110 --> 35:12.186
Bill...

35:25.959 --> 35:27.453
Bill?

35:27.585 --> 35:29.329
Bill?

35:29.462 --> 35:32.831
I know that a few hours from now

35:32.966 --> 35:37.628
somebody will be standing
in this guy's closet smelling his shirts,

35:37.762 --> 35:40.253
trying to reconnect.

35:40.390 --> 35:42.632
I know where that bear is going.

35:44.686 --> 35:50.309
She's in search of the relationship
all of us are try to recreate in one way...

35:50.442 --> 35:52.518
or another.

36:03.288 --> 36:06.408
You'd think, since I know
so much about everything,

36:06.541 --> 36:08.581
I wouldn't do what I'm about to do.

36:28.313 --> 36:29.807
Got it.

36:32.275 --> 36:35.561
- Yeah?
- I could do this. It was no big deal.

36:35.695 --> 36:37.771
Reapers look different to the living.

36:37.906 --> 36:40.112
Do you want something?

36:41.284 --> 36:44.036
How are you?

36:44.162 --> 36:46.867
- OK.
- Good.

36:49.209 --> 36:52.079
I'm a friend of your mom's.

36:52.212 --> 36:54.288
I like your hair like this.

36:57.467 --> 36:59.792
What are you doing?

37:00.428 --> 37:04.011
Get in the house. Get in the house.

37:06.393 --> 37:09.429
I remember you.

37:09.562 --> 37:11.638
The yard sale.

37:12.774 --> 37:14.850
- You should leave.
- Joy...

37:16.444 --> 37:18.401
- I don't have time.
- Please!

37:18.530 --> 37:20.238
Mom!

37:23.618 --> 37:24.649
What?

37:24.786 --> 37:27.324
I figured I wouldn't have much time,

37:27.455 --> 37:32.248
so I worked out the right thing to say.
It was supposed to go like this.

37:32.377 --> 37:36.671
When I was five, I had
an imaginary friend named Broccoli Bee.

37:36.798 --> 37:38.921
You took out one of your steno pads

37:39.050 --> 37:43.843
and we wrote a story with pictures
on one side and words on the other.

37:44.889 --> 37:46.170
Georgia?

37:46.307 --> 37:49.558
But it kind of looked more like this.

37:49.686 --> 37:52.307
When I was five, I, um...

37:53.773 --> 37:55.849
I, uh... uh...

37:56.776 --> 38:00.026
I had a friend and...

38:01.114 --> 38:02.738
I, um...

38:04.034 --> 38:07.319
That's it.
That's all that would come out.

38:07.454 --> 38:12.910
I had lots of other things to say,
but they all melted into a fine mist.

38:13.043 --> 38:14.916
Mom, on the other hand...

38:15.045 --> 38:18.710
You are a real fucking piece of work,
aren't you?

38:18.840 --> 38:20.714
Get the fuck outta here!

38:20.842 --> 38:24.709
You think you can show up here
and pull this kind of shit?

38:24.846 --> 38:29.722
Know what it's like to lose a daughter?
Get your skanky ass outta here!

38:29.851 --> 38:32.769
That's right! You run, bitch! Run!

40:07.866 --> 40:09.408
Thanks.

40:12.037 --> 40:13.697
Mm-hm.

40:16.499 --> 40:19.286
Are you gonna tell him?

40:19.419 --> 40:21.791
If you don't.

40:35.685 --> 40:38.176
I know the menu like my phone number.

40:38.313 --> 40:42.180
I still have to read it
to know what I want.

40:42.317 --> 40:44.393
Can I get a number 6?

40:49.199 --> 40:51.275
Want this?

40:52.702 --> 40:54.778
I went home again.

40:56.748 --> 40:58.824
Pass me a napkin.

41:05.715 --> 41:07.922
You OK?

41:13.723 --> 41:15.799
You lose anything?

41:18.269 --> 41:19.929
Memories?

41:24.693 --> 41:26.981
I don't know.

41:27.112 --> 41:30.029
I tried to tell my mom a story and...

41:32.909 --> 41:36.243
.. now I can't even remember what it was.

41:38.206 --> 41:40.412
It's cruel and simple.

41:40.542 --> 41:45.038
The more I held onto my life,
the less there was to hold onto.

41:45.880 --> 41:47.209
So...

41:48.383 --> 41:50.459
.. my whole life, everything...

41:52.637 --> 41:55.923
.. all I get to keep
are thoughts and memories?

41:58.852 --> 42:01.010
It's all we ever had, peanut.

42:05.275 --> 42:07.730
I'll see you in the morning?

42:07.861 --> 42:09.403
Yeah.

42:20.415 --> 42:24.365
At the end of the day,
all you have are your experiences.

42:24.502 --> 42:27.373
I spent so much of my life
avoiding experiences,

42:27.505 --> 42:29.996
I didn't have much to lose.

42:33.303 --> 42:37.217
I was just thinking that maybe
I'd done the whole thing wrong,

42:37.349 --> 42:39.425
when breakfast came.
