Thank you.

00:31.097 --> 00:32.360
Why'd you change that?

00:32.432 --> 00:35.402
Just to mess with your head.
Get me Judy at Oakland-Alameda.

00:35.468 --> 00:38.165
When you get right down to it,
what I'm saying is this, Case --

00:38.238 --> 00:40.332
I think you should start getting
out of your house.

-- Dan, we're going to Arrowhead
first, then Denver. -- Got it.

00:43.376 --> 00:44.810
Just out of your house.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.039
I am out of my house.

00:46.112 --> 00:48.137
I've been out of my house

[Snaps fingers]

01:00.527 --> 01:03.827
[Shouting] Casey, did you get the
change on Arrowhead and Denver?!

01:03.897 --> 01:06.229
Natalie, if you shout
into a microphone

01:06.299 --> 01:08.199
when I'm wearing an earpiece,
it poses the question

01:08.268 --> 01:10.396
"ls there a decibel level at
which the human head will just,

01:10.470 --> 01:11.665

Is he in a better mood
than he was this morning,

01:13.706 --> 01:15.970
or is this gonna be
another crappy show?

01:16.042 --> 01:18.807
Hey, Casey, lsaao wants to know
if you're in a better mood --

01:18.878 --> 01:19.811
Shut up.

01:19.879 --> 01:21.313
Pretty crappy, yeah.

Uh, excuse me.

01:28.955 --> 01:30.184
Dan's got his hand raised.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.088
Why are we quoting
high-level sources

01:32.158 --> 01:33.887
inside the Swiss
Olympic Committee

01:33.960 --> 01:35.928
on Helsinki's bid
for the 2010 Olympics?

01:35.995 --> 01:38.259
-- What's the problem?
-- Helsinki's in Finland.

01:39.332 --> 01:40.265
Really?

01:40.333 --> 01:41.801
Yeah.
Don't worry. I got it.

01:41.868 --> 01:42.858
Are you sure?

01:43.670 --> 01:45.263
Am I sure that Helsinki's
in Finland?

01:45.338 --> 01:46.533
Yeah. I'm quite sure.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.005
I thought it was in Sweden.

01:48.074 --> 01:49.974
It says "unnamed Swiss
Olympic officials."

Sweden or Switzerland?

01:52.612 --> 01:53.841
It's in Finland.

-- Elliott, get something up on the Net!
-- What do you need?

01:56.382 --> 01:58.180

in Finland.

Hey, Jason Grisham

02:54.774 --> 02:56.708
in a strip bar
in Houston last night.

02:56.776 --> 02:58.972
[Chuckles ] That was
only a matter of time.

02:59.045 --> 03:00.479
Kim and Elliott are on it.

03:00.547 --> 03:03.482
Kim, Elliott.
Jason Grisham -- what's up?

03:03.550 --> 03:05.314
He shot 12-for-15
from the field,

03:05.385 --> 03:07.114
and then he went
to the Silver Key.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.747
-- It's a nude nightclub.
-- Topless only.

03:09.822 --> 03:13.224
A guy called him something he didn't like,
and Grisham hit him with a bottle of cognac.

03:13.293 --> 03:14.351
-- <i>It was brandy.</i>
-- <i>It was cognac.</i>

03:14.427 --> 03:15.417
<i>It was Courvoisier.</i>

03:15.495 --> 03:17.463
Courvoisier <i>is</i> cognac.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.693
You get me the lawyer, you get me the agent,
then get us Jason Grisham on the phone.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.565
-- We can't get Grisham on the phone.
-- Yes, you can.

03:22.635 --> 03:24.797
-- We are trying.
-- Try harder.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.464
32 points.
It was a career high.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.940
Then he sends a guy to
the hospital with 14 stitches.

03:29.008 --> 03:31.534
-- Can you imagine if he'd had
a lousy game? -- [Chuckles]

03:31.611 --> 03:32.578
You come in early?

03:32.645 --> 03:33.942
I came in early.

03:34.013 --> 03:35.708
You slept in the office?

03:35.782 --> 03:37.841
-- I came in early.
-- You came in yesterday.

03:37.917 --> 03:39.146
Mom...

03:39.219 --> 03:40.914
Have I told you about
my New York renaissance?

03:40.987 --> 03:43.388
Yeah. A lot. You've told me about
your New York renaissance a lot.

03:43.456 --> 03:45.220
<i>Last night's show.
What's up?</i>

03:45.291 --> 03:47.419
Grisham's free on bail,
Casey slept in his office,

03:47.493 --> 03:49.962
and I'm having
a New York renaissance.

03:50.029 --> 03:53.090
[Chuckles] Cool. Rundown
meeting's in five minutes.

03:53.166 --> 03:55.498
I think the show's going to hell
in a handbasket,

03:55.568 --> 03:57.559
and I'm ready to fire
the whole bunch of you.

03:57.637 --> 03:59.765
Yes, but you won't
'cause we're all family here,

03:59.839 --> 04:01.500
and I'm just like
a daughter to you.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.770
No, this is
a television show here,

04:03.843 --> 04:05.902
and you're very much like
an employee to me.

04:05.979 --> 04:08.243
I got to give Casey
some slack, Isaac.

04:08.314 --> 04:11.011
-- Why? -- Why do I have
to give him some slack?

04:11.084 --> 04:13.849
That's the question. If you can't
tell me, I can't tell the network.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.322
-- Isaac... -- What, is there something
going on between the two of you?

04:17.390 --> 04:19.051
-- Absolutely not.
-- Then why?

04:19.125 --> 04:21.321
Because I owe it to him,
that's why. We all do.

04:21.394 --> 04:22.862
Now he's having
some personal problems --

04:22.929 --> 04:25.421
Oh, I know all about
his problems.

04:25.498 --> 04:27.262
You know, the network
knows about his problems, too,

04:27.333 --> 04:29.301
as a result of which,
they become <i>my</i> problems.

04:29.369 --> 04:32.999
And I'm saying that at the very most,
I want them to be your problems.

04:33.072 --> 04:34.471
-- Got it.
-- Do you?

04:34.540 --> 04:35.530
-- Yes.
-- Good.

04:37.010 --> 04:40.275
It's a genuine renaissance,
Casey.

04:40.346 --> 04:42.110
I have lived in New York
my whole life.

04:42.181 --> 04:44.445
This is the time I should
be sick of it, but I'm not.

04:44.517 --> 04:46.849
-- 'Cause you're having a renaissance.
-- That's right.

04:46.919 --> 04:47.852
-- Really?
-- Yeah.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.287
Nobody cares.

04:50.356 --> 04:53.485
So how do we avoid these
Helsinki mishaps in the future?

04:53.559 --> 04:56.358
-- We've been short-handed since Phil and
Michael left. -- VVell, hire somebody.

04:56.429 --> 04:59.364
Natalie's been interviewing people
for an associate producer position,

04:59.432 --> 05:01.230
and I'm meeting her finalists
this afternoon.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.396
You guys, he is so
totally cute and intense

05:04.470 --> 05:05.960
with a dark mystery
about him that says,

05:06.039 --> 05:08.872
"This is not a technician,
this is an artist."

05:11.110 --> 05:14.444
VVell, before you hire him, can you
make sure he can find Finland on a map?

05:14.514 --> 05:17.313
You know what, Isaac?
Maybe let that go.

05:17.383 --> 05:20.353
You have Metropolitan Opera under
the baton of Mr. James Levine.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.684
-- <i>What is he talking about?</i>
-- <i>His New York renaissance.</i>

05:22.755 --> 05:24.018
-- Want to hear about it?
-- No.

05:24.090 --> 05:25.990
Good.
Quickly, now -- talk to me.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.391
7 through 17.
We got the whiparound with what?

05:28.461 --> 05:30.395
<i>Lambeau, 3Com, and Foxboro.</i>

05:30.463 --> 05:33.524
Casey's got Tampa Bay and the
mighty Bengals of Cincinnati.

05:33.599 --> 05:36.398
-- What's in Cincinnati? -- I/VeH,
the mighty Bengals, for one thing.

05:36.469 --> 05:38.233
-- <i>They're</i> gonna <i>cut Santori.</i>
-- <i>The placekicker?</i>

05:38.304 --> 05:40.500
He's made eight field-goal
attempts in three games

05:40.573 --> 05:42.405
and has connected on a grand
total of none of them.

05:42.475 --> 05:44.603
-- Oh, I've met him. He's a good guy.
-- Can't kick.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.111
-- He is a good guy.
-- Can't kick.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.671
-- He'll get picked up by another team.
-- No, he won't. You know why?

05:48.748 --> 05:51.149
-- Why?
-- <i>'Cause he can't kick.</i>

05:51.217 --> 05:54.187
All right, commercial one,
then on to The Dugout Report --

05:54.253 --> 05:55.550
I saw him kick in practice.

05:55.621 --> 05:59.057
At this level, they pretty much want
you to be able to kick in a game.

05:59.125 --> 06:00.490
Moving on,
from center ice --

06:00.560 --> 06:02.460
<i>I once kicked a 12-yard
field goal in a gym class.</i>

06:02.528 --> 06:06.294
VVell, then you should get yourself a tryout
for the mighty Bengals of Cincinnati.

06:06.366 --> 06:10.098
Excuse me. If anyone needs me, I'll
be hurling myself out the window.

06:10.169 --> 06:12.103
Plaza hotel, Oak Bar,
dry martini.

06:12.171 --> 06:14.105
New York at night, my friend.
This city never sleeps.

06:14.173 --> 06:17.837
<i>Commercial 2,
then on to segment 24.</i>

06:17.910 --> 06:20.402
Actually, I'd like to go back
to 23 if nobody minds.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.073
Any chance we could do it
a little later?

06:22.148 --> 06:24.742
-- I <i>want to move this along.</i> -- <i>The
network would like me to address this now.</i>

06:24.817 --> 06:27.718
J.J., Dana's the producer. We like to
give her the impression she's in charge.

06:27.787 --> 06:28.879
[Chuckling]

06:28.955 --> 06:30.480
It's just that we're
a little short on time.

06:30.556 --> 06:33.218
-- Segment 24 -- -- I have some
concerns about segment 23.

06:33.292 --> 06:35.556
Is this you or the network?

06:35.628 --> 06:38.256
In these meetings, Casey, mine
is the voice of the network.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.560
Wow, J.J.!

06:39.632 --> 06:41.760
What are your concerns?

06:41.834 --> 06:42.960
Who is Ntozake Nelson,

06:43.035 --> 06:45.629
and why are you doing a
3-minute-and-20-second feature on him?

06:45.705 --> 06:46.467
Natalie!

06:46.539 --> 06:50.271
Ntozake Nelson's a South African
distance runner -- 15,000 meters.

06:50.343 --> 06:53.438
As a schoolteacher in Jamestown, he led
protests against the white majority.

06:53.513 --> 06:54.947
That's swell,
but, folks, I have --

06:55.014 --> 06:56.072
-- No, I --
-- Hey!

06:57.483 --> 06:59.417
He was beaten up
and thrown in jail.

06:59.485 --> 07:02.750
His legs were broken, and the doctor
said he'd never walk without a cane.

07:02.822 --> 07:05.792
He's 41 years old, and guess
what he's doing tonight.

07:05.858 --> 07:07.792
It doesn't matter, 'cause I've
already changed the channel.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.521
He's running
in the World Pacific Games,

07:09.595 --> 07:12.895
an event this network is
carrying live tonight at 9:00.

07:12.965 --> 07:15.195
The Ntozake Nelson feature
is promoting --

07:15.268 --> 07:17.703
Look, I am all for you guys
spotlighting our other programming.

07:17.770 --> 07:21.400
But can't we find a good-looking 22-year-old
American who might actually win?

07:21.474 --> 07:24.603
VVell, if you find him, send him over
to my place, but in the meantime --

07:24.677 --> 07:27.647
Lo0k,lhave a ratings book on my
desk that's very instructive.

07:27.713 --> 07:30.614
Now, it says that our key demographics,
including 11- to 17-year-olds

07:30.683 --> 07:33.812
who watch your morning rerun over
breakfast, do not want to see features

07:33.886 --> 07:37.288
<i>about 41-year-old, politically oppressed
Third World distance runners.</i>

07:37.356 --> 07:39.757
Now, they are instructing us, and I
think it's a good idea to listen.

07:39.826 --> 07:41.920
I've got Jason Grisham
on the phone.

07:41.994 --> 07:44.361
<i>J.J., Danny and I have
hosted shows</i>

07:44.430 --> 07:46.558
in the fifth- and third-largest
markets in the country,

07:46.632 --> 07:49.067
and we've received awards
for journalistic excellence.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.729
I'd prefer not to take my
instructions from 11-year-olds.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.602
And the next time you sit
in our rundown meeting

07:53.673 --> 07:55.607
and I hear the voice of the
network come out of your mouth,

07:55.675 --> 07:57.404
I'm gonna put my foot
on your throat.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.373
[Door opens, closes]

08:03.449 --> 08:05.213
You ever ride
the subway all day long,

08:05.284 --> 08:06.945
I mean,
just for the fun of it?

08:09.689 --> 08:12.283
Natalie, Kim, Elliott,
everybody else,

08:12.358 --> 08:14.349
um, you want to step outside
as well, please?

08:15.761 --> 08:17.251
Go ahead.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.299
[Dana clears throat]

08:23.102 --> 08:25.537
I'd like to apologize for Casey's
performance in these meetings lately.

08:25.605 --> 08:28.836
<i>Dana, I'm not concerned with Casey's
performance in these meetings lately.</i>

08:28.908 --> 08:30.637
Well, I appreciate
your understanding.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.611
I'm concerned with Casey's
performance on the air lately.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.203
-- What's your point?
-- My point is...

08:35.280 --> 08:38.876
at the moment, Casey has
less on-air charm and charisma

08:38.951 --> 08:41.818
than my high school driving
instructor, and you know it, Dan.

08:41.888 --> 08:43.686
<i>Now, I think
the time has come</i>

08:43.756 --> 08:46.487
for you to think about the
possibility of another partner.

08:46.559 --> 08:48.960
I'm not gonna do the show with your
high school driving instructor, J.J.,

08:49.028 --> 08:50.518
if that's what you're
asking me, okay, so...

08:51.898 --> 08:53.662
Who will you do
the show with?

08:53.733 --> 08:55.064
I'll do the show with Casey.

08:55.134 --> 08:57.967
You've got a very big future
at this network, Dan --

08:58.037 --> 09:02.133
My future is writing and anchoring a sports
program with my partner, Casey McCall.

09:02.208 --> 09:05.803
Now, if it's here, it's here. If
it's not, it is someplace else.

09:05.878 --> 09:09.212
For right now I'm gonna forget
this conversation ever took place.

09:10.249 --> 09:11.546
Dana, Isaac,
you guys need me?

09:11.617 --> 09:13.312
No. Thanks, Dan.
You're done.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.079
I really got to admire

09:16.155 --> 09:19.614
the way you manhandled
my staff this morning, J.J.

09:19.692 --> 09:21.126
Look, Isaac,
I have a specific --

09:21.193 --> 09:22.126
Look...

09:22.194 --> 09:24.094
don't take me on.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.962
The network's not gonna
wait forever.

09:32.972 --> 09:34.906
[Door opens, closes]

09:34.974 --> 09:36.499
It's your call, Dana.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.238
But pretty soon,
it's gonna be my call.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.440
'Cause here's the thing --

09:41.514 --> 09:43.915
I can't let it be
their call.

09:48.287 --> 09:49.618
Yeah.

09:53.826 --> 09:56.158
They can put a Tonka truck
on Mars and send me pictures,

09:56.228 --> 09:59.095
but I can't get a decent satellite
signal from Buenos Aires.

09:59.165 --> 10:00.257
Excuse me. Ma'am?

10:00.333 --> 10:02.529
That's probably because of
a high-pressure system

10:02.602 --> 10:05.299
building up around 32 degrees
south latitude.

10:05.371 --> 10:06.930
It'll blow by in two hours.

10:07.006 --> 10:09.168
-- There's weather in outer space?
-- Uh, no, maflam.

10:09.241 --> 10:12.541
But I think you're leasing time on
the East Tech keyhole satellite,

10:12.612 --> 10:16.105
and their signal gets cleared through
a tracking station in Mexico City.

10:16.182 --> 10:18.116
Yeah, but the point
I'm making is that I can't --

10:18.184 --> 10:19.345
Who -- Who --
Who is this?

10:20.019 --> 10:21.544
I'm Jeremy Goodwin.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.022
Oh, you're here for
the associate producer job.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.752
Yes, and let me just say that it is an
extraordinary honor to even be asked --

10:26.826 --> 10:29.056
-- I'm not ready for you yet.
-- I'll sit right here.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.425
32 degrees latitude.

10:30.496 --> 10:32.590
-- South latitude.
-- Ah. I get them mixed up.

10:32.665 --> 10:34.155
Common mistake.

10:36.435 --> 10:38.369
-- Hey.
-- Casey.

10:38.437 --> 10:42.101
Listen, I need you to take 30
seconds off the NFL injury report

10:42.174 --> 10:44.336
and give it to me for the, uh, intro
on ACC recruiting violations.

10:44.410 --> 10:45.377
-- Fine.
-- Thanks.

10:45.444 --> 10:47.037
You're screwing up
my show, Casey.

10:48.047 --> 10:49.310
Keep the 30 seconds.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.282
-- That's not what I mean.
-- I know. I was joking.

10:51.350 --> 10:54.376
-- I know you were joking. -- Yeah, I could tell
by the way you didn't laugh at all when I said it.

10:54.453 --> 10:57.821
That's 'cause I'm mad at you and also,
it wasn't that funny. [Chuckles]

10:57.890 --> 11:01.258
Dana, did you come in here
to give me a pep talk?

11:01.327 --> 11:02.852
'Cause if you came in here
to give me a pep talk,

11:02.928 --> 11:05.989
can we assume that it already happened,
that it worked, and that I'm peppy?

11:06.065 --> 11:07.658
Casey, sit down.

11:07.733 --> 11:10.862
Now, I know you think that there are
250 other people in this business

11:10.936 --> 11:12.700
-- No, I don't think there are 250 other people who can
produce this show. -- who could produce this show.

11:12.772 --> 11:14.604
Yes, you do, and whether you're
right or whether you're wrong,

11:14.674 --> 11:17.234
I'm the one that has the job,
and I love it.

11:17.309 --> 11:19.368
<i>I love</i> producing
"Sports Night."

11:23.149 --> 11:25.413
I don't come down
till 3:00 in the morning.

11:25.484 --> 11:28.385
I love doing "Sports Night,"
and you used to, too.

11:30.723 --> 11:32.851
Now, I came in to tell you
that it looks like

11:32.925 --> 11:36.054
Cleveland's gonna go to a four-man
rotation for the stretch drive,

11:36.128 --> 11:37.618
I came in to tell you
that it looks like

11:37.697 --> 11:40.189
segments 16 through 21
might have to get condensed

11:43.035 --> 11:45.868
but mostly
I came in to tell you...

11:45.938 --> 11:48.873
you are screwing up my show.

11:48.941 --> 11:49.931
-- Natalie!
-- Yo!

11:50.009 --> 11:51.272
Let's meet with your guy.

11:51.343 --> 11:54.244
[indistinct voices]

11:54.313 --> 11:56.111
Jeremy,
this is Dana Whitaker.

11:56.182 --> 11:57.115
-- We've met.
-- Yes.

11:57.183 --> 11:59.743
You have an impressive resume.
Let me ask you some questions.

11:59.819 --> 12:01.082
-- You look nervous.
-- I'm okay.

12:01.153 --> 12:02.746
-- <i>Would you like</i> a <i>glass of water?</i>
-- <i>Uh, no, thank</i> you.

12:02.822 --> 12:04.221
<i>A soft drink?
We have Fresca.</i>

12:04.290 --> 12:07.157
If you're taking orders, I'll have the
angel-hair pasta and a nice merlot.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.660
-- I'm just -- I'm just trying to make him
comfortable. -- Can we interview the man?

12:08.728 --> 12:11.060
I know. A little professionalism
is all I'm saying.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.064
-- I could come back later. --
What are your favorite sports?

12:13.132 --> 12:14.156
Uh, beg your pardon.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.758
-- Where are you strongest?
-- Oh, football.

12:15.835 --> 12:18.463
-- <i>Great. Let's talk about basketball.</i>
-- I <i>said football.</i>

12:18.537 --> 12:20.471
I heard you.
Let's talk about basketball.

12:20.539 --> 12:22.371
Uh, we could talk about
baseball or hockey.

12:22.441 --> 12:24.307
Oh, you're pretty strong
in baseball and hockey, are you?

12:24.376 --> 12:27.038
-- Not as strong as football, but --
-- Good. <i>Let's</i> talk <i>about</i> the Knfcks.

12:27.113 --> 12:28.046
[Clears throat] I walked right
into that one, didn't I?

12:28.114 --> 12:30.481
Well, I left the door
wide open for you.

12:30.549 --> 12:31.812
-- Shot of bourbon?
-- <i>Please.</i>

12:31.884 --> 12:32.976
Sit.

12:33.052 --> 12:35.578
I'm sorry. That was harsh.
I hurt your feelings.

12:35.654 --> 12:38.954
[Clears throat] Name three things
the Knicks need to do this season

12:39.024 --> 12:40.253
to make it to the finals.

12:40.326 --> 12:41.555
Um, I couldn't get
another question?

12:41.627 --> 12:43.755
You will, but not till I hear
an answer to the first one.

12:43.829 --> 12:45.763
What do the Knicks...

12:45.831 --> 12:48.766
<i>Three things the Knicks
need to do to contend.</i>

12:50.069 --> 12:51.332
Ms. Whitaker...

12:51.403 --> 12:53.599
<i>I would be great
at this job.</i>

12:53.672 --> 12:57.302
You've got to believe me when I tell you
I've been training my whole life for it.

12:57.376 --> 12:59.504
I've crunched stats,
I've broken down film,

12:59.578 --> 13:02.878
and there wasn't a team at my high school
that didn't have me for an equipment manager.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.576
I have read every box score
in every newspaper

13:05.651 --> 13:07.642
that's printed in English
and has a sports section,

13:07.720 --> 13:10.417
and I have seen “Sports Night“ every
night since your first broadcast,

13:10.489 --> 13:13.117
two years, two months,
and a week ago today.

13:13.192 --> 13:14.956
Now, yes, sure, indeed.

13:15.027 --> 13:17.462
I can tell you what Ewing and
Oakley are shooting from the field

13:17.530 --> 13:20.192
and that you're not gonna stop John
Starks if he squares up to the basket,

13:20.266 --> 13:24.533
and put any defensive pressure on Charlie
VVard, he's gonna fold like a cheap card table,

13:24.603 --> 13:27.664
but if you're asking me for
genuinely sophisticated analyses --

13:27.740 --> 13:30.675
and I sense that you are --

13:30.743 --> 13:32.677
you gotta give me some time...

13:32.745 --> 13:34.577
at least 20 minutes.

13:40.119 --> 13:43.214
-- <i>Did that make any sense?</i>
-- <i>I wasn't really listening.</i>

13:43.289 --> 13:47.226
-- <i>Oh, God! It's just</i> -- -- <i>Jeremy, Jeremy...
this is teievision. Things happen.</i>

13:47.293 --> 13:50.661
If you want to work here, you've
got to not spontaneously wig out.

13:52.431 --> 13:54.024
Right. Right.

13:55.134 --> 13:56.067
The Knicks.

13:56.135 --> 13:59.127
Name three things.

13:59.205 --> 14:01.640
-- Improve their free-throw
percentage. -- Yes.

14:01.707 --> 14:03.732
-- Run the floor.
-- Okay. One more.

14:05.144 --> 14:07.169
Tell Spike Lee to sit down
and shut up?

14:07.246 --> 14:09.772
-- Excellent! -- VVell,
welcome to “Sports Night.“

14:17.223 --> 14:19.419
"Dale Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon,
and Rusty Wallace

What's the problem?

14:26.198 --> 14:27.427
<i>You don't want the rhyme.</i>

14:27.499 --> 14:30.093
You got to put "yesterday"
in the second sentence.

14:30.169 --> 14:32.661
"Just a few of the big-name
drivers NASCAR had on hand

14:32.738 --> 14:34.399

Hey, we have to talk.

14:38.677 --> 14:39.735
What's up?

14:39.812 --> 14:42.645
Well, I've been thinking
about this for a while.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.706
I mean, I want you to know that
I've given this some thought.

14:44.783 --> 14:47.411
I think “yesterday has got to go in the
first sentence. I'll tell you why.

14:47.486 --> 14:48.783
I'm thinking about
leaving the show.

14:48.854 --> 14:50.185
For how long?

14:50.256 --> 14:52.190
I've been thinking about it
for a while now.

14:52.258 --> 14:54.249
No, I didn't ask you how long you
were thinking about leaving the show.

14:54.326 --> 14:55.919
I asked you how long you were
thinking about leaving the show for,

14:55.995 --> 14:57.622
For good.

14:59.665 --> 15:01.099
Did you get an offer?

15:01.166 --> 15:03.294
No, I didn't get an offer, Danny. I'm
not -- I'm not going to another show.

15:03.369 --> 15:04.803
I'm talking about
getting out of sports.

15:04.870 --> 15:06.531
-- Why?
-- <i>Look, I'm just tired of it.</i>

15:06.605 --> 15:07.868
-- All right?
-- You're tired of what?

15:11.343 --> 15:12.777
"But first this --

15:12.845 --> 15:15.507
"Sacramento power forward
Jason Grisham was released

15:15.581 --> 15:18.983
by a judge in Houston this morning
after posting a $5,000 bond.“

15:19.051 --> 15:21.986
VVhioh, by the way, he paid in cash
he happened to have in his pocket.

15:22.054 --> 15:24.421
So Jason Grisham's a jackass.
You know Jason Grisham.

15:24.490 --> 15:27.551
Look, I got into this 'cause I like
getting people to like sports.

15:27.626 --> 15:31.187
And I've turned into a P.R. man
for punks and thugs.

15:31.263 --> 15:34.961
<i>Now any atrocity, no matter how
ridiculous or hideous or childish --</i>

15:35.034 --> 15:36.695
it doesn't matter --
I make it sports.

15:36.769 --> 15:40.103
<i>'IO-cent bagman whacks</i> a <i>skater's leg
with</i> a <i>crowbar</i> -- <i>that's sports.</i>

15:40.172 --> 15:43.267
second-round draft pick gets cranky
in a Houston bar, and that's sports.

15:43.342 --> 15:46.073
And let's not forget the mother
of all great sports stories --

15:46.145 --> 15:47.579
a double homicide
in Brentwood.

15:47.646 --> 15:49.444
If you want to talk,
I'm all for it.

15:49.515 --> 15:53.042
Really, I am. But let's talk about
what you need to talk about, okay?

15:53.118 --> 15:55.712
The moral decay in American sports
isn't the problem here, all right?

15:55.788 --> 15:57.222
Look, it is the problem.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.314
I -- Look, I have
a 7-year-old son

15:59.391 --> 16:01.416
that I get to
see on Wednesdays

16:01.493 --> 16:04.053
and alternate weekends,
and these are his heroes.

16:04.129 --> 16:06.826
And now, six days a week, they're
also his male role models.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.424
Well, quitting your job
ought to do the trick.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.491
-- Look, Danny, I know I'm leaving you
in the lurch -- -- No, I mean it.

16:10.569 --> 16:13.630
You should definitely quit your job, because
that way, sports will be good again. Yeah.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.834
<i>A-Also, your wife,
she'll take you back,</i>

16:15.908 --> 16:19.173
and you can be a role model for
your son, knowing as we do how --

16:19.244 --> 16:21.611
how women and children, you know,
admire the bitter and the unemployed.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.409
-- <i>Are you mental?</i>
-- <i>I'll see you at airtime.</i>

16:23.482 --> 16:26.076
<i>Yeah, one thing you definitely don't
want to do is talk to your friends.</i>

16:26.151 --> 16:27.312
You know,
I wouldn't do that.

16:27.386 --> 16:29.047
Hey, I know you're pissed,
and that's fine,

16:29.121 --> 16:30.953
but canning the sarcasm
wouldn't be out of line.

16:31.023 --> 16:33.515
“Fine“ and “line“ rhymed. I'd move
“fine“ to the second sentence.

16:33.592 --> 16:35.492
Danny, you're gonna find
another partner.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.529
Anybody would kill
to do this show with you.

16:37.596 --> 16:39.530
I've been here every day,
Casey --

16:39.598 --> 16:42.226
every day --
and I have kept my mouth shut

16:42.301 --> 16:44.429
because that's
what you asked me to do.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.995
But if you'd have asked me,

16:47.072 --> 16:50.235
I'd have told you that Lisa is an
angry, unhappy, punishing woman,

16:50.309 --> 16:52.573
and in 10 years there's
never been a single moment

16:52.644 --> 16:56.046
that has suggested to me she has
any affection for you at all.

16:56.949 --> 16:59.384
And I have no patience
for people like that.

16:59.451 --> 17:02.512
Now, the people here,
they like you --

17:02.588 --> 17:04.556
Isaac, Natalie,
Kim, Elliott.

17:04.623 --> 17:08.082
I don't know who this new guy, Jeremy,
is, but he seems to like you just fine.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.151
<i>Have you even noticed
that Dana's been keeping</i>

17:10.229 --> 17:12.993
J.J. and the network away from you
with a whip and a chair, huh?

17:13.065 --> 17:16.057
<i>Have you noticed that she's been
risking her job for you every day?</i>

17:16.135 --> 17:18.968
And do you really think, my friend, it
has that much to do with your talent?

17:19.038 --> 17:20.199
These are people
who like you, okay,

17:20.271 --> 17:22.502
-- Guys... -- and know what
you've been going through,

17:22.574 --> 17:25.839
-- and for three months now, you have shown us
nothing but the back of your hand, -- Guys...

17:25.911 --> 17:27.378
and now you're gonna show us
the door?

17:27.445 --> 17:29.073
Well, excuse me, all right,

17:29.148 --> 17:31.446
but the wisdom of your decision
isn't entirely clear to me here.

17:31.517 --> 17:33.007
-- Okay? Yeah, I'm pissed.
-- Excuse me. Fellas...

17:33.085 --> 17:34.644
And you know what?
I'm tired of it.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.552
_. Dan! Casey,
" What?!

17:36.622 --> 17:39.182
There's something going on you're
gonna want to see. Come on!

[indistinct voices]

17:50.636 --> 17:51.797
Hey.

17:51.870 --> 17:53.338
Hey.
Hey, what's going on?

17:53.405 --> 17:54.497
Check it out.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.371
Oh, we need audio!
Yo!

17:56.442 --> 17:58.536
That time can't be right.
Danny. Danny...

17:58.610 --> 18:00.100
Danny, can that time
be right?

18:00.179 --> 18:01.806
<i>Man on TV:
...absolutely crazy!</i>

18:01.880 --> 18:04.008
<i>With 900 meters left,
at 41 years old,</i>

18:04.083 --> 18:08.611
<i>Ntozake Nelson is on a pace to
absolutely shatter the world record!</i>

18:08.687 --> 18:10.712
Go ahead on, old man.

18:10.789 --> 18:11.915
Is he gonna do this?

18:11.990 --> 18:14.516
-- Does it look like he's planning
on slowing down? -- Come on.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.186
-- Bring it.
-- Bring it on.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.228
Come on! Move it!

18:17.296 --> 18:18.991
Go! Come on!

18:19.064 --> 18:19.929
Go!

18:19.998 --> 18:21.932
[Cheers and applause]

Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

18:28.107 --> 18:29.700
Lisa!
Lisa, Lisa, it's me!

18:29.775 --> 18:32.005
Listen, I need you to do
something for me. I'm sorry.

18:32.077 --> 18:34.774
I need you to wake up Charlie and
give him the phone for a second.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.872
<i>B-Because I need you to!</i>

18:36.949 --> 18:39.111
[Cheering continues]

18:45.757 --> 18:47.088
Charlie!

18:47.159 --> 18:50.527
L-It's dad. Hey, uh, did you
finish all your homework?

18:50.596 --> 18:53.361
Good. Turn on your TV.
Turn to my channel.

18:53.432 --> 18:55.025
I want you to watch this.

18:55.100 --> 18:57.398
This guy's name is
Ntozake Nelson.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.961
Now, look, I'll call you tomorrow.
I'll tell you all about it.

19:00.038 --> 19:02.200
But for now,
you just watch him run.

19:02.274 --> 19:03.708
'Cause he's not doing much.

19:03.775 --> 19:07.143
He's just running faster
than any man's ever run before.

19:07.212 --> 19:10.238
I'm gonna be on the air
in about 12 minutes,

19:10.315 --> 19:13.910
and if Mom says it's okay, you can
watch the beginning of the show.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.954
Then I'm gonna give you
the special signal.

19:16.021 --> 19:18.513
That means you got to turn off
your TV and go to sleep.

19:20.259 --> 19:22.250
I love you, too, Charlie.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.160
[Receiver hangs up]

19:25.998 --> 19:28.057
[Cheers and applause]

19:28.133 --> 19:31.433
Listen up. They're gonna bounce to us for
a 15-second promo at the end of the race.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.164
Natalie, get the first team
in the studio.

19:33.238 --> 19:34.330
Elliott, Kim, let's go.

19:34.406 --> 19:35.339
I need graphics!

19:35.407 --> 19:36.841
-- We need Casey.
-- Okay. Got it.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.570
I'll take care of him.

19:38.644 --> 19:41.079
[indistinct voices]

19:42.314 --> 19:43.304
You okay?

19:43.382 --> 19:44.816
Absolutely.

19:44.883 --> 19:46.180
Get to work.

19:46.251 --> 19:47.582
Absolutely.

19:47.653 --> 19:49.644
[Telephone ringing]

19:49.721 --> 19:51.780
It's a 15-second teaser, Dan.
You need copy?

19:51.857 --> 19:53.689
-- Is the opening Lakers/Sontos?
-- Lakers/Sontos, Pistons/Heat.

19:53.759 --> 19:55.193
-- I'll take it.
-- You want it?

19:55.260 --> 19:57.251
It's not that my teasers are
better than yours, Danny,

19:57.329 --> 20:00.264
it's just that yours are
vastly inferior to mine.

20:01.333 --> 20:04.428
I'm new here, so, uh, if I'm in
your way, you just let me know.

20:04.503 --> 20:07.131
[Chair rattles, thud]

20:07.206 --> 20:09.140
No problem.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.539
-- Daniel.
-- What?

20:10.609 --> 20:13.271
You were right. I was wrong.
It won't happen again.

20:13.345 --> 20:14.710
<i>Man." 15 seconds.</i>

20:14.780 --> 20:16.942
You want to do something tonight
after the show?

20:17.015 --> 20:20.576
Yeah. You know, I was gonna ride the Staten Island
Ferry for a while, eat a hot dog. You want to come?

20:20.652 --> 20:22.313
Yeah, absolutely,
and I'll tell you why.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.412
'Cause it's 17 degrees outside
with the Windchill,

20:24.489 --> 20:26.082
so what I want to do
is stand in a boat

20:26.158 --> 20:28.286
in the middle of New York
Harbor at half-past midnight.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.351
-- You have a better idea?
-- Well, we could go to a bar,

20:30.429 --> 20:32.830
find some people we don't like,
and beat the crap out of them.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.730
Heads up.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.826
In 3...2...1.

20:37.903 --> 20:41.032
I'm Casey McCall
alongside Dan Rydell.

20:41.106 --> 20:43.871
Lakers/Sontos, Pistons/Heat,
and guess what.

20:43.942 --> 20:47.537
Ntozake Nelson's got something
to say about a world record.

20:47.613 --> 20:49.581
Seeing is believing, so stick
around for “Sports Night,“

20:49.648 --> 20:51.582
-- coming at the top of the hour.
-- He's back.

20:51.650 --> 20:52.879
You'll be glad you did.

20:52.951 --> 20:53.884
<i>Man." We're out.</i>

20:53.952 --> 20:55.351
We're up in nine minutes.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.945
Dana, could you come here
for a second?

20:57.022 --> 20:59.514
Do you have any idea
how to spell Ntozake?

21:00.859 --> 21:02.725
-- <i>What</i> do <i>you want?</i>
-- <i>I want you to come here.</i>

21:02.794 --> 21:04.421
What?

21:09.568 --> 21:12.538
No one...can produce
this show but you.

21:16.808 --> 21:20.369
[Jazz music plays]

21:20.445 --> 21:23.881
[Clears throat]
You...have nine minutes.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.383
Somebody get him
a new shirt.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.474
What's wrong
with my shirt?

21:26.551 --> 21:27.916
You got my mascara
on your collar.

21:27.986 --> 21:29.010
-- Natalie?
-- Yeah.

21:29.087 --> 21:31.852
Get somebody on the phone. I want to make
sure there aren't going to be any mistakes.

21:31.923 --> 21:34.585
-- I'm nervous about the satellite
feed from Buenos Aires. -- Sure.

21:34.660 --> 21:35.752
-- Natalie?
-- Yeah.

21:35.827 --> 21:37.488
-- Argentina.
-- Right.

21:37.562 --> 21:38.529
Natalie!

21:38.597 --> 21:41.191
Um...double-check that.

21:41.266 --> 21:43.997
You know what? Here's something
I don't understand about rugby.

21:44.069 --> 21:45.798
Oh, you <i>do</i> understand
something about rugby?

21:45.871 --> 21:47.965
I've played rugby, all right?
Now, I want to ask you --

21:48.040 --> 21:50.065
Wait. Wait. W-When have
you played rugby before?

21:50.142 --> 21:52.236
When I was in college
I played...coed rugby.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.439
[Laughing]
You did not play rugby.

to ask you a question...</i>
