WEBVTT

00:02.263 --> 00:03.307
- Previously on
"The Baker and the Beauty"...

00:03.351 --> 00:04.569
- First time here?

00:04.613 --> 00:06.702
Try the soup.
Everything else here sucks.

00:07.529 --> 00:08.791
- Oh!

00:08.834 --> 00:11.837
- And as of this moment,
I am officially single.

00:13.187 --> 00:14.797
- Fame is hard
on a relationship.

00:14.840 --> 00:18.279
- We're shooting the entire
thing on location in Morocco.

00:18.322 --> 00:20.194
You'd be perfect for the lead.

00:20.237 --> 00:21.586
- Sooner or later, someone's
gonna want to tell your side

00:21.630 --> 00:23.327
whether you like it or not.

00:23.371 --> 00:25.851
- I'm gay.
Why can't you just accept this?

00:25.895 --> 00:30.117
- Because I can't protect you
for the rest of your life.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.161
- I compared today's ultrasound

00:31.205 --> 00:33.163
with the one
from six months ago.

00:33.207 --> 00:35.165
The time of "wait and see"
is over.

00:35.209 --> 00:36.688
- I called the bank.
- You did?

00:36.732 --> 00:39.126
- 20 years we've been working
just to make ends meet.

00:39.169 --> 00:40.431
I only have one condition.

00:40.475 --> 00:42.651
We call the café Mari's.

00:47.656 --> 00:48.613
- Uh-huh, yeah.

00:48.657 --> 00:50.093
Well, I don't know how much

00:50.137 --> 00:51.660
I'm supposed
to be sharing with you.

00:51.703 --> 00:53.575
I'm sort of in a nondisclosure
agreement with my parents.

00:53.618 --> 00:56.534
But what I will tell you is
that it's a sort of expansion,

00:56.578 --> 01:00.669
like, a café, tables, maybe
a little bit of entertainment.

01:00.712 --> 01:04.107
Oh, excuse me, and it's
pronounced Mateo, not Matty-o.

01:04.150 --> 01:05.108
Yello.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.718
- Yello?

01:06.762 --> 01:08.198
Mateo, I told you

01:08.242 --> 01:10.722
you have to start
acting like a professional.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.768
You think Pharrell
answers the phone like that?

01:12.811 --> 01:14.465
- I don't think Pharrell
answers his own phone.

01:14.509 --> 01:17.207
I think he has people doing it
for him because he's big-time!

01:17.251 --> 01:18.469
- Okay, just stop.

01:18.513 --> 01:22.125
Listen, have you heard
of Marlowe St. John?

01:22.169 --> 01:24.345
- Yeah, he's, like, the hottest
music producer in Miami. Why?

01:24.388 --> 01:26.521
- 'Cause I got you
a meeting with him.

01:28.262 --> 01:32.179
- Whoo!

01:32.222 --> 01:34.311
- That's your son?

01:34.355 --> 01:37.140
- Yeah, well,
he takes after my wife.

01:37.184 --> 01:39.403
A natural ham.

01:39.447 --> 01:42.450
His brother's a little bit
more responsible...usually.

01:42.493 --> 01:44.495
- Okay.

01:44.539 --> 01:45.888
- Hello?
- Daniel.

01:45.931 --> 01:47.542
The contractor's here.
Where are you?

01:47.585 --> 01:49.065
- Remember?

01:49.109 --> 01:51.241
I told you Noa's announcing
her big movie role today.

01:51.285 --> 01:52.764
- The woman has done
a million interviews.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.375
All of a sudden,
she needs you there?

01:54.418 --> 01:55.811
Daniel,
where are your priorities?

01:55.854 --> 01:57.378
- Pop, I gotta go.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.119
Get started.
I'll be there soon.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.904
- Does your family know you're
coming to Morocco with us?

02:01.947 --> 02:06.256
-  Not yet,
but I will tell them today

02:06.300 --> 02:07.562
after I pick up
some body armor.

02:07.605 --> 02:08.693
Ooh.

02:08.737 --> 02:10.173
- Molly Fisher
back with "Miami Live"

02:10.217 --> 02:12.436
at half past 9:00
in the morning.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.526
And we're here talking with
the one and only Noa Hamilton,

02:15.570 --> 02:17.833
broadcasting live
from her headquarters

02:17.876 --> 02:19.791
here in the heart
of downtown Miami.

02:19.835 --> 02:21.750
It's a work space known
as the Lab,

02:21.793 --> 02:23.447
where they test
all their latest products.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.449
Noa, I have to tell you that

02:25.493 --> 02:27.843
your new cosmetic line
is amazing.

02:27.886 --> 02:30.454
- Thank you so much.
We're really proud of it.

02:30.498 --> 02:31.803
- I want
to talk about the rumors

02:31.847 --> 02:34.676
that your latest move
will be into acting.

02:34.719 --> 02:37.592
- Well, I can confirm
that the rumors are true.

02:37.635 --> 02:39.463
I will be making
my acting debut

02:39.507 --> 02:41.552
in Melanie Caan's next feature.

02:41.596 --> 02:42.771
- That is amazing.

02:42.814 --> 02:44.251
The one shooting
in Morocco, right?

02:44.294 --> 02:46.818
- Yes. Very excited about it.
A little nervous.

02:46.862 --> 02:49.256
- Now, we all know that you
have a new man in your life.

02:49.299 --> 02:50.779
- Yes.
- But I would be remiss

02:50.822 --> 02:52.302
if I didn't ask you
about the interview

02:52.346 --> 02:53.912
that his ex-girlfriend
released this morning.

02:55.044 --> 02:56.959
- I'm sorry, you have me
at a disadvantage.

02:57.002 --> 02:58.830
I'm not aware of any interview.

02:58.874 --> 03:00.267
- We have a clip.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.269
- Everyone knows me
from that video.

03:02.312 --> 03:05.489
I'm the crazy ex-girlfriend,
except I'm not.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.491
I mean, yeah, I proposed
to him by singing,

03:07.535 --> 03:08.797
and yes, when he said no,

03:08.840 --> 03:10.668
I was so hurt,
I dumped soup on him.

03:10.712 --> 03:13.454
But I figured we'd
work it out, you know?

03:13.497 --> 03:15.847
I never thought Noa Hamilton
would be there.

03:15.891 --> 03:19.503
- Lewis, this is the third
time you've delayed treatment.

03:19.547 --> 03:20.678
- I know.

03:20.722 --> 03:21.897
- Well, we need
to get ahead of this.

03:21.940 --> 03:24.508
- Okay, look,
I--I promise you

03:24.552 --> 03:26.597
I'm not going to cancel
again, all right?

03:26.641 --> 03:28.556
- I'm gonna have the office
call to set an appointment.

03:28.599 --> 03:31.472
- Thank you, Dr. Talbot.

03:31.515 --> 03:32.908
Okay, bye.

03:34.518 --> 03:36.694
- Everything okay?
- What?

03:36.738 --> 03:39.523
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

03:39.567 --> 03:40.829
Vanessa talked.

03:40.872 --> 03:43.614
- Oh, God.

03:43.658 --> 03:46.356
- As much as that must hurt,
it must be worse knowing

03:46.400 --> 03:50.534
that Noa met Daniel
before you proposed.

03:50.578 --> 03:53.276
According to our sources,
they spoke in the restroom

03:53.320 --> 03:55.365
just before
you started your song.

03:55.409 --> 03:56.758
That Noa is actually the one

03:56.801 --> 03:58.542
who told Daniel
to order the infamous soup.

04:00.892 --> 04:03.243
- Would you like to respond?

04:04.331 --> 04:06.071
- You need to get Molly
back on course right now

04:06.115 --> 04:07.551
or you will never have
another A-list celebrity

04:07.595 --> 04:08.813
on this show again.

04:08.857 --> 04:09.858
Go.

04:11.425 --> 04:14.297
- Well--

04:14.341 --> 04:16.733
- Cut!
Go to commercial.

04:16.778 --> 04:18.519
- Oh, God.
Son of a--

04:36.841 --> 04:40.018
- That interview was bad.
- Kind of working here.

04:40.062 --> 04:43.021
- Like, really bad.
- You know what, Natalie?

04:43.065 --> 04:45.328
TV rots the brain.

04:45.372 --> 04:48.549
- Wait, are you
defending Vanessa right now?

04:48.592 --> 04:50.986
Mateo.
- I don't know.

04:51.029 --> 04:53.467
You heard her, a'ight?

04:53.510 --> 04:55.860
She was just
telling it like it is.

04:55.904 --> 04:57.819
- Mateo, don't even try
to take her side in this.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.429
- Side.

04:59.473 --> 05:02.650
Side is such a divisive word,
you know?

05:02.693 --> 05:06.741
Especially when people
should be coming together.

05:06.784 --> 05:08.743
What am I supposed to do?

05:11.006 --> 05:14.792
She's my manager.
And a good one.

05:14.836 --> 05:18.013
She got me a meeting
with a music producer.

05:18.056 --> 05:20.494
It's tomorrow.

05:20.537 --> 05:21.930
- I get it.

05:21.973 --> 05:24.367
She's been helpful,
and that's great,

05:24.411 --> 05:27.414
but sooner or later, you're
gonna have to make a decision.

05:27.457 --> 05:29.024
You're either loyal
to your family

05:29.067 --> 05:31.026
or you're loyal to yourself.

05:35.857 --> 05:38.773
- Over here,
we could put bistro tables.

05:38.816 --> 05:39.774
- Mm-hmm.

05:39.817 --> 05:42.559
- And espresso counter
right here.

05:42.603 --> 05:44.866
- Maybe a little stage
over there

05:44.909 --> 05:46.520
where you can sing
one night a week.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.652
Papi, I would love that!

05:51.612 --> 05:53.657
Just think about how hard
we've worked for this...

05:53.701 --> 05:54.658
Yeah.

05:54.702 --> 05:55.964
And the future
this could bring.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.835
I know people will love it
just like our bakery.

05:57.879 --> 05:59.533
- Wise woman.
- I know.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.404
- Thank you.

06:01.448 --> 06:02.579
- Want to look
at some plans here?

06:02.623 --> 06:04.625
- Yes.
- All right.

06:04.668 --> 06:07.454
Okay, I get a deposit today,
I could break through this wall

06:07.497 --> 06:09.847
right into your bakery
I'm saying Monday.

06:09.891 --> 06:11.762
Three days for demolition,
all right?

06:11.806 --> 06:13.982
That's Monday, Tuesday--
leaves me Thursday for cleanup.

06:14.025 --> 06:16.419
Friday I'm gonna drop seal
with a tarp right there,

06:16.463 --> 06:17.725
which means you could
reopen your bakery

06:17.768 --> 06:19.901
while my guys are working
right here in the café.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.685
- Mr. Hayes, no disrespect,

06:21.729 --> 06:23.034
but contractors and deadlines

06:23.078 --> 06:25.036
don't always seem to get along.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.516
Are you sure
that we only have

06:26.560 --> 06:27.996
to close the bakery
for one week?

06:28.039 --> 06:29.214
- Mr. Garcia,

06:29.258 --> 06:31.173
I'm a small-business owner
just like you.

06:31.216 --> 06:34.568
I understand the value of
a day open versus a day closed.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.439
- Okay?
- Good.

06:36.483 --> 06:39.790
- Now, if I could get
a couple signatures from you.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.096
That's for you.

06:41.139 --> 06:43.881
Right here,
this is the city permit.

06:43.925 --> 06:46.971
And this is the state permit
right there, please.

06:47.015 --> 06:48.538
Very good.
- Mm-hmm.

06:48.582 --> 06:51.149
- And right here
is the health department

06:51.193 --> 06:53.151
for reopening and remodeling
your bakery.

06:54.675 --> 06:57.199
Look at you, signing more
autographs than Noa Hamilton.

06:58.809 --> 07:00.463
- Excitement today
on "Miami Live."

07:00.507 --> 07:02.465
A fire alarm just after Noa
was confronted

07:02.509 --> 07:03.901
with the footage
of her boyfriend's ex.

07:04.772 --> 07:06.513
- Congratulations, baker boy.

07:06.556 --> 07:07.731
By pulling that fire alarm,

07:07.775 --> 07:10.038
you took a bad
but containable story

07:10.081 --> 07:11.648
and turned it
into national news.

07:11.692 --> 07:13.563
- If you didn't try
to bribe Vanessa,

07:13.607 --> 07:14.564
she probably wouldn't
have talked.

07:14.608 --> 07:15.652
- Oh, really?

07:15.696 --> 07:16.653
You're gonna double down
on that now?

07:16.697 --> 07:17.915
- Don't get mad at me because

07:17.959 --> 07:19.264
you took a phone call
when this all went down.

07:19.308 --> 07:20.788
Listen, I'm sorry,
I couldn't just stand there

07:20.831 --> 07:22.050
and watch you get ambushed
like that.

07:22.093 --> 07:23.747
- I know you were
just trying to help,

07:23.791 --> 07:25.836
but in the future,
I can defend myself.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.751
- Is it too much
to hope, Daniel,

07:27.795 --> 07:31.015
that you can keep a low profile
until all this blows over?

07:31.059 --> 07:32.234
- We're going through
renovations

07:32.277 --> 07:33.583
at the bakery all week. I--

07:33.627 --> 07:35.890
- I know.
You should go.

07:36.804 --> 07:38.109
- Try to stay out of trouble,
Gucci.

07:38.153 --> 07:40.547
Oh, that is rich.

07:41.243 --> 07:42.940
Oh, God.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.768
- Well, don't be mad at him.

07:44.812 --> 07:47.684
- I'm not mad at him.

07:47.728 --> 07:50.121
- I'm just trying
to scare some sense into him.

07:50.165 --> 07:51.775
I'm mad at you.

07:51.819 --> 07:54.256
Noa, when it comes
to romantic relationships,

07:54.299 --> 07:56.301
you don't have the luxury
to make the kind of mistakes

07:56.345 --> 07:57.520
that normal people do.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.174
- I'm aware.
- Oh, really?

07:59.217 --> 08:00.392
Well, how come every time
I turn my back,

08:00.436 --> 08:02.003
you're like a toddler
running into traffic?

08:02.046 --> 08:03.961
- Please don't speak
to me like that.

08:04.005 --> 08:05.093
- How could you
not have warned me?

08:05.136 --> 08:06.311
- About what?

08:06.355 --> 08:07.965
- About being
in the men's room that night.

08:08.009 --> 08:09.619
- I always use
the men's room, Lewis.

08:09.663 --> 08:11.142
There's no line.

08:11.186 --> 08:12.143
Nothing happened.

08:12.187 --> 08:13.971
- It doesn't matter
what happened.

08:14.015 --> 08:16.539
It matters how it looks.
You know that.

08:16.583 --> 08:19.063
You have gotta keep your eye
on the ball at all times,

08:19.107 --> 08:20.674
especially when I'm not around.

08:23.285 --> 08:25.940
Now, any other landmines
you want to tell me about?

08:25.983 --> 08:28.638
Did you two get married in
Vegas while I wasn't looking?

08:28.682 --> 08:32.990
- No. That's everything.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.905
So how bad do you think
it's gonna get?

08:34.948 --> 08:36.080
- Worse than Miley

08:36.124 --> 08:39.736
but hopefully better
than Angelina and Jen.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.739
I'll start doing
some damage control.

08:42.783 --> 08:45.089
It's gonna be okay, all right?

08:45.133 --> 08:46.874
Hey.

08:46.917 --> 08:49.659
- Who knew Molly Fisher
was such a bitch?

08:54.838 --> 08:57.145
- Would you like to respond?

08:57.188 --> 08:58.755
- Well--

08:59.756 --> 09:02.846
- It's time to move,
but we need to move fast.

09:02.890 --> 09:05.240
- Sir?

09:05.283 --> 09:08.112
- That publicity
is gonna be bad.

09:08.156 --> 09:10.593
She's going
to lose orders over it,

09:10.637 --> 09:12.726
and that
is gonna scare the board.

09:14.031 --> 09:16.686
Add to that the fact
she's going away for 12 weeks

09:16.730 --> 09:20.385
to be an actress,
of all things.

09:20.429 --> 09:21.996
That doesn't sound like a woman

09:22.039 --> 09:24.389
who is fit to run a company,
now, does it?

09:35.357 --> 09:38.099
- Well, I'm asking you
to cancel the cancellation.

09:38.142 --> 09:40.536
Well, could you at least delay
the decision for a week?

09:40.580 --> 09:41.972
Thank you,
because a week from now,

09:42.016 --> 09:44.018
this'll all be
a non-story.

09:44.061 --> 09:46.629
Neiman's is giving us a week
before pulling the spring line.

09:46.673 --> 09:47.978
- What?
- It's too hot.

09:48.022 --> 09:49.632
Their concerned that your
relationship with Daniel

09:49.676 --> 09:51.765
is bad for optics
and it's gonna hurt the brand.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.288
- Well, that's ridiculous.

09:53.331 --> 09:54.942
Daniel hasn't done
anything wrong.

09:54.985 --> 09:57.118
- That's four
national retailers in a week.

09:57.161 --> 09:58.946
- I just got a call
from Mark Logan.

09:58.989 --> 10:00.295
- Ugh, the board is worried.

10:00.338 --> 10:02.863
- Well, in all fairness,
it is their job to worry.

10:02.906 --> 10:04.255
- Mark Logan's not a worrier.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.736
- It's been 24 hours
and the story's not going away.

10:06.780 --> 10:07.911
- You think something's up?

10:07.955 --> 10:09.478
- Well, our bottom line's
getting hit

10:09.521 --> 10:12.046
and there's another offer to
buy us on the table from KKR&A.

10:12.089 --> 10:13.917
It's not a coincidence.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.266
- Okay, set up meetings

10:15.310 --> 10:17.965
with all the board members
one-on-one.

10:18.008 --> 10:19.619
Let's see who cracks.

10:27.278 --> 10:29.150
- You excited?

10:29.193 --> 10:33.241
I'm nervous but...

10:33.284 --> 10:34.895
a little excited, yeah.

10:35.765 --> 10:38.028
It's been a while
since I've felt like this.

10:38.072 --> 10:41.118
The possibility of a future
I thought was beyond my grasp.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.775
- Speaking of, you know,
Noa doing this movie--

10:45.819 --> 10:47.603
- You know,
when we first moved to Miami

10:47.647 --> 10:49.823
and I got the job
at the bakery,

10:49.866 --> 10:52.869
this place--this placed
used to be a pet store.

10:52.913 --> 10:54.218
You remember?

10:54.262 --> 10:55.742
- Yeah.

10:55.785 --> 10:57.961
Me and Mateo would come visit
you during your lunch break

10:58.005 --> 11:00.181
and feed bread
to the little animals.

11:01.965 --> 11:04.228
Wow.
Time flies.

11:04.272 --> 11:05.752
- Yep.

11:06.927 --> 11:09.277
You and Mateo were completely
disinterested teenagers

11:09.320 --> 11:11.366
when your mother and I
finally bought the bakery.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.760
Natalie wasn't even born.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.938
This time...

11:17.981 --> 11:20.288
We all get to create
a place together.

11:21.985 --> 11:23.900
And one day,

11:23.944 --> 11:27.077
you're gonna be standing
right here with your son

11:27.121 --> 11:29.210
and you're gonna say,

11:29.253 --> 11:32.866
"I remember the day
that we broke down that wall."

11:35.782 --> 11:37.740
Hmm?

11:41.439 --> 11:43.964
What was it that you
were saying about Noa's movie?

11:45.356 --> 11:47.054
- Nothing.

11:49.186 --> 11:50.318
- Are you doing okay?

11:51.711 --> 11:55.279
With all this nonsense
since Vanessa's interview?

11:55.323 --> 11:58.761
- Yeah, it's just
the things that they write.

11:59.414 --> 12:00.981
The lies.

12:01.024 --> 12:03.766
Noa says I shouldn't read
any of it, but...

12:03.810 --> 12:05.812
it's almost impossible not to,
you know?

12:07.727 --> 12:11.121
- I'm sorry, mi'jo, but
if you plan to stick together,

12:11.165 --> 12:13.297
you're gonna have
to get used to it.

12:13.341 --> 12:17.084
Our world is this,
Little Havana.

12:17.127 --> 12:18.999
Her world is...mira.

12:21.871 --> 12:27.050
Personally...
I prefer our world.

12:34.188 --> 12:36.016
- Mm-mm.
We need to talk.

12:38.453 --> 12:39.846
We need to talk.

12:41.195 --> 12:43.327
We need to--

12:46.026 --> 12:47.157
I'm sorry.

12:59.039 --> 13:00.823
- Mateo?
You're an hour early.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.520
We don't have
to meet until lunch.

13:02.564 --> 13:05.872
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

13:07.264 --> 13:08.439
- Vanessa, I never thought

13:08.483 --> 13:12.095
that you would do anything
to hurt my family.

13:12.139 --> 13:15.403
It's unacceptable
and I will not tolerate it.

13:16.534 --> 13:17.884
You're fired.

13:21.365 --> 13:22.410
- Fine.

13:23.324 --> 13:25.065
- What do you mean, fine?

13:26.022 --> 13:29.112
- I mean, I think that's fair.
- No.

13:29.156 --> 13:30.418
No, it's not fair.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.160
After everything
you've done for me?

13:34.901 --> 13:37.425
It's probably better we don't
work together right now.

13:37.468 --> 13:39.383
- Vanessa, Vanessa, wait.

13:40.515 --> 13:41.864
I mean,
you shouldn't have to suffer

13:41.908 --> 13:43.257
because of what Daniel did.

13:44.084 --> 13:45.389
- Go, Mateo.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.874
Just promise me
you'll still take the meeting

13:51.918 --> 13:54.224
and that you'll go
as yourself,

13:54.268 --> 13:55.922
not MC Cubano.

13:55.965 --> 13:57.010
- Vanessa--

14:04.104 --> 14:06.541
- It's, like,
trending right now.

14:09.239 --> 14:11.154
- Can't believe Vanessa
would sell out my brother

14:11.198 --> 14:12.982
for her 15 minutes.

14:13.026 --> 14:16.594
- Wait, so you told Mateo
he had to fire her as payback?

14:16.638 --> 14:17.813
- Yes.

14:20.076 --> 14:22.470
Oh, I see your point.

14:22.513 --> 14:26.039
What I should've said is that
she had to manage him for life.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.131
- Garciadiggers.

14:33.307 --> 14:36.005
You must be so proud
of your portmanteau.

14:36.049 --> 14:38.834
- Trying to say
that's not your name?

14:38.878 --> 14:40.880
- Just ignore them.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.925
- That's right,
you better walk away.

14:42.969 --> 14:45.406
Brother throws over
a beautiful Latina queen

14:45.449 --> 14:48.148
for some rich white trash.

14:49.366 --> 14:51.020
- I don't know what's worse,

14:51.064 --> 14:52.979
that you still believe
everything you read

14:53.022 --> 14:56.112
in those trashy magazines
your mom picks up from 7-Eleven

14:56.156 --> 14:59.115
or that you're trying
to play some Latinx race card

14:59.159 --> 15:01.248
when I live in Little Havana

15:01.291 --> 15:03.293
and you're
a third-generation Floridian

15:03.337 --> 15:05.905
whose street accent
drops more than her GPA.

15:06.557 --> 15:07.907
What's wrong?

15:07.950 --> 15:09.125
All out of a few finger snaps,

15:09.169 --> 15:11.084
Miss Anna from Coral Gables?

15:12.520 --> 15:13.913
Boom.

15:13.956 --> 15:14.957
Bye.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.220
- Uh, you are awesome.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.482
- I kind of am.

15:18.526 --> 15:19.919
- Hey, Garcia.

15:23.357 --> 15:24.793
- Thank you
for sitting down with me, Mark.

15:24.836 --> 15:26.490
As you know, the last few days
have been challenging.

15:26.534 --> 15:29.406
Obviously, Marcia,
my image affects the company.

15:29.450 --> 15:30.799
I wanted to give you
the opportunity

15:30.842 --> 15:32.366
to ask me any questions

15:32.409 --> 15:34.542
or raise any concerns
that you might have.

15:34.585 --> 15:36.370
- I appreciate that, Noa,
but...

15:36.413 --> 15:38.024
- I don't think it's necessary.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.243
- I think this whole story
is just gonna blow over.

15:40.287 --> 15:41.288
- Whatever losses we incur...

15:41.331 --> 15:42.985
- Will just be bumps
in the road.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.596
- Long-term,
I don't foresee any problems.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.817
- Well, thank you, Mark,
for your time and your candor.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.079
- You're very welcome, Noa.

15:50.123 --> 15:51.211
It's always a pleasure
to see you.

15:51.254 --> 15:52.560
- I'll see you next time.
Bye.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.347
- How does a man
with no discernible taste

15:57.391 --> 15:59.393
wind up on the board
of a fashion company?

16:00.437 --> 16:01.438
- If you don't
have the mankles,

16:01.482 --> 16:03.092
you can't rock the crop.

16:03.136 --> 16:04.441
- Lewis, lay off.

16:04.485 --> 16:06.139
Mark's been on the board
since day one.

16:06.182 --> 16:07.444
He's practically family.

16:07.488 --> 16:09.185
- Well, someone should
introduce him to a mirror.

16:09.229 --> 16:11.971
- Well, what did he say?

16:12.014 --> 16:15.278
- Nothing out of the ordinary,
just like all the others.

16:15.322 --> 16:17.498
- Well, we know for a fact
the board have been talking.

16:17.541 --> 16:20.109
And if they're not talking
to you,

16:20.153 --> 16:21.502
they're talking about you.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.334
- It was short
and to the point.

16:29.075 --> 16:31.033
Yeah,
she was definitely fishing.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.861
But I don't think
she knows anything.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.299
- Thanks, Mark.

16:36.343 --> 16:39.476
If anything changes
before next week, call me.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.174
Day or night.

16:42.653 --> 16:46.005
- Great, great.
So we'll be in LA.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.136
Oh, listen,

16:47.180 --> 16:49.008
my lunch meeting's here,
so I gotta jump.

16:50.313 --> 16:52.141
Jenna, we're going
to LA tomorrow.

16:52.185 --> 16:54.187
Call the office,
let everyone know.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.277
You must be Mateo.

16:57.320 --> 17:00.106
- Yes, uh, thank you so much
for meeting with me.

17:00.149 --> 17:03.631
A pleasure to meet you,
and, uh, I'm such a fan.

17:03.674 --> 17:04.935
- Oh.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.415
I love all your music.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.201
I think you're so talented,
and when I mean love,

17:08.243 --> 17:10.898
I mean, like, love, like, that
awkward love, like--

17:10.942 --> 17:12.074
- Thank you.

17:13.728 --> 17:15.598
So where's this manager?
I'm dying to meet her.

17:15.643 --> 17:18.340
- Oh, uh,

17:18.385 --> 17:20.560
I guess she's late.

17:20.604 --> 17:24.042
- Excuse me, excuse me, perdón.
Hola.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.348
You want to take pictures?

17:25.392 --> 17:28.089
I will bring out
our menus and some samples.

17:28.134 --> 17:31.311
Anyone who puts it in the paper
gets free lunch for a month.

17:33.704 --> 17:36.011
Where are the workers?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.187
- I guess
they're taking a long lunch.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.276
- Oh.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.451
Well, I guess that means

17:41.495 --> 17:43.497
we have the whole place
to ourselves.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.196
- So I listen to everything,

17:47.240 --> 17:48.589
and I think that there
is a window of time

17:48.632 --> 17:50.591
for the type of music
that fuses genres,

17:50.634 --> 17:52.288
and that's
the one guiding principle

17:52.332 --> 17:53.463
behind every song
that I write--

17:53.507 --> 17:55.596
- Mateo, Mateo.

17:55.639 --> 17:58.164
You seem like a good guy.

17:58.207 --> 18:00.079
And you do have some talent.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.297
- Thank--thank you.

18:01.341 --> 18:03.386
- But you're nothing special.

18:03.430 --> 18:04.953
I don't mean that to be harsh.

18:04.996 --> 18:07.303
In this business,
honesty is hard to come by.

18:07.347 --> 18:10.393
That's why I always
tell it like it is.

18:10.437 --> 18:13.266
Your work is derivative,
your voice is nothing special,

18:13.309 --> 18:16.356
and you don't look like a star.

18:16.399 --> 18:18.967
My advice is, do it as a hobby.

18:19.010 --> 18:22.536
You know, play weddings,
have fun, make a little money.

18:22.579 --> 18:25.234
But you own
a small family business.

18:25.278 --> 18:29.325
Why sacrifice that for a dream
that won't be reality?

18:32.633 --> 18:35.244
- So why'd you meet with me
if that's how you feel?

18:35.288 --> 18:37.159
- I wanted
to meet your manager.

18:37.203 --> 18:39.118
She has so much hustle,
so much passion.

18:39.161 --> 18:42.338
I wanted to see
if she would work with me.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.125
- Right.

18:47.691 --> 18:50.041
Thank you for your time.

18:58.572 --> 19:00.269
- Salud.
- Salud.

19:03.794 --> 19:05.056
- Mmm.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.494
Mmm.
Mm-mm.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.586
Penny for your thoughts.

19:16.111 --> 19:18.766
I'm still worried about Daniel.

19:18.809 --> 19:21.464
He acts strong, but...

19:21.508 --> 19:23.423
I can tell the attention
is getting to him.

19:25.120 --> 19:29.168
- Well, he's sensitive.
Like his father.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.039
- Me?
- Yes, you.

19:31.082 --> 19:32.301
- Aww.

19:32.345 --> 19:35.783
You are sensitive.
- Mm?

19:37.524 --> 19:39.047
- A big softie.

19:39.090 --> 19:40.440
- Mm?
- Mm-hmm.

19:41.658 --> 19:43.530
- And that...

19:43.573 --> 19:45.662
is why...

19:45.706 --> 19:48.187
I love you.

19:51.494 --> 19:53.670
- Would you still love me
if this café doesn't work?

19:55.150 --> 19:57.674
That is the stupidest question
you've ever asked me

19:57.718 --> 19:59.241
in the history
of stupid questions.

19:59.285 --> 20:00.634
- What, what? Come here.
Get over here.

20:00.677 --> 20:02.679
Ven acá, ven acá.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.725
Mm.

20:06.379 --> 20:07.815
I swear to you,

20:07.858 --> 20:09.686
life was a lot more fun before
cell phones were invented.

20:11.514 --> 20:14.300
Hello?
This is she.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.433
What?

20:18.652 --> 20:19.783
Okay, I'm on my way.

20:21.872 --> 20:24.135
Natalie got into a fight
at school.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.314
- I want to be clear.

20:28.357 --> 20:31.839
Deering has a zero-tolerance
policy towards violence.

20:31.882 --> 20:33.710
We will be looking
at the circumstances of this--

20:33.754 --> 20:35.886
- The circumstances are,
they jumped me and Amy.

20:35.930 --> 20:39.281
- Natalie.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.457
- I'm not gonna apologize
for kicking their asses.

20:41.501 --> 20:43.242
- Natalie Garcia.

20:51.424 --> 20:52.773
I'm sorry.

20:52.816 --> 20:55.732
- As I was saying, we will be
looking at everything,

20:55.776 --> 20:57.821
including the hate speech
painted on her locker.

20:57.865 --> 21:00.694
- Hate speech?

21:00.737 --> 21:02.652
About her sexuality?

21:02.696 --> 21:03.914
- "Garciadiggers."

21:03.958 --> 21:05.394
I believe it's a reference

21:05.438 --> 21:08.179
to your eldest son's
relationship with Noa Hamilton.

21:08.223 --> 21:09.920
We will be collecting
all the evidence

21:09.964 --> 21:11.879
in regard to the girls' actions
and we will see

21:11.922 --> 21:14.316
if there are any
mitigating circumstances

21:14.360 --> 21:17.145
that might warrant a punishment
less than expulsion.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.675
- Thank you.

21:28.548 --> 21:29.853
Next.
- Daniel, wait.

21:29.897 --> 21:32.334
Come on, I believe
in fair and balanced reporting.

21:32.378 --> 21:33.335
- Sure, you do.

21:33.379 --> 21:34.336
- I want to give you

21:34.380 --> 21:36.207
an opportunity
to make a statement.

21:37.208 --> 21:39.863
- The only thing I have
to say to you is not suitable,

21:39.907 --> 21:43.302
even for a reputable website
like yours.

21:44.390 --> 21:47.523
- I get it, you're angry.

21:47.567 --> 21:50.439
- If you really cared, you'll
take down that interview.

21:50.483 --> 21:51.571
- Why would I do that?

21:51.614 --> 21:52.920
That interview's
gotten more clicks

21:52.963 --> 21:54.443
than anything
I've ever published.

21:54.487 --> 21:56.271
- Because it's
the right thing to do.

21:57.751 --> 21:59.709
- I heard
your bakery's expanding.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.145
Congrats.

22:01.189 --> 22:03.409
How 'bout a story about
how your family is cashing in

22:03.452 --> 22:05.498
on their connections
to Noa Hamilton?

22:05.541 --> 22:08.675
- Leave my family out of this.
- Let's talk about you, then.

22:08.718 --> 22:12.505
Boring baker to Noa-brand
Instagram sensation.

22:13.506 --> 22:15.464
- Okay,
it's time for you to go.

22:15.508 --> 22:17.814
- Oh, Daniel.
I'm sorry.

22:17.858 --> 22:19.425
Look, would you rather
we talk more about

22:19.468 --> 22:22.428
how you're probably just gonna
run right back to Vanessa?

22:22.471 --> 22:24.212
Is that right? I don't know,
like, what's the deal?

22:24.255 --> 22:25.300
You can tell me.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.607
- This is you
being fair and balanced?

22:27.650 --> 22:28.999
Come on, get out of here.

22:31.611 --> 22:33.526
- Don't say I didn't offer.

22:43.579 --> 22:46.365
- The number you have dialed
for Y&E Construction

22:46.408 --> 22:48.279
is no longer in service.

22:51.021 --> 22:53.284
- Mom, the entire way home,
you wouldn't listen.

22:53.328 --> 22:55.243
Come on, you won't
let me explain anything.

22:55.286 --> 22:56.940
- What possible explanation
can you have

22:56.984 --> 22:58.377
for that kind of behavior?

22:58.420 --> 23:00.379
Uh-uh!
Go, now!

23:01.902 --> 23:03.860
- The number you have dialed
for Y&E Construction

23:03.904 --> 23:05.558
is no longer in service.

23:08.778 --> 23:11.433
Papi, it's bad.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.740
- Yes, it is.

23:28.668 --> 23:31.235
- Apparently, it's a new scam

23:31.279 --> 23:33.324
where they spoof
the 800 number.

23:33.368 --> 23:35.501
From then on, they have you
call them directly.

23:37.285 --> 23:39.635
They said they've hit about
ten businesses in Miami

23:39.679 --> 23:41.332
in the last month.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.818
Has the check cleared?

23:48.862 --> 23:50.820
- Yesterday.

23:55.651 --> 23:57.348
What are we gonna do
about this?

23:58.611 --> 24:00.700
And Natalie?

24:00.743 --> 24:02.919
Papi, if she gets expelled, I--

24:05.008 --> 24:07.794
- Okay, good, I was hoping
to catch you guys.

24:08.882 --> 24:10.231
Is now a bad time?

24:12.276 --> 24:15.236
- Actually, it is, Papi.
Can it wait?

24:15.279 --> 24:17.325
No, it can't.

24:17.368 --> 24:18.500
I was trying
to find the right time,

24:18.544 --> 24:20.763
but there's never a right time.

24:20.807 --> 24:22.548
So...

24:23.897 --> 24:27.248
Noa's going to Morocco to shoot
that movie this summer,

24:27.291 --> 24:28.379
and...

24:29.946 --> 24:31.470
I'm going with her.

24:32.819 --> 24:35.517
It's three months
and it's a great opportunity.

24:35.561 --> 24:36.605
And honestly,
with everything

24:36.649 --> 24:38.128
that's been going on
around here,

24:38.172 --> 24:39.521
I feel like I need a break,
maybe just get away, and--

24:39.565 --> 24:41.610
- Mi'jo, mi'jo, mi'jo,
slow down, slow down.

24:41.654 --> 24:42.829
Three months?

24:42.872 --> 24:44.787
Daniel, you can't go away
for three months.

24:44.831 --> 24:46.485
We need you here.

24:46.528 --> 24:47.703
- Well, I was thinking
I could find

24:47.747 --> 24:49.792
my temporary replacement
and train them.

24:49.836 --> 24:52.012
Look, it's a
once-in-a-lifetime chance.

24:52.055 --> 24:53.361
And she'll be working

24:53.404 --> 24:54.754
and I can make more videos,
build my library--

24:54.797 --> 24:56.582
- Daniel, what about us?

24:56.625 --> 24:59.019
What about our new café,
our expansion?

24:59.062 --> 25:00.716
Are you just gonna leave us?

25:02.239 --> 25:03.980
- If you want to turn your back
on us, I can't stop you.

25:05.416 --> 25:07.462
If you want to pretend
to be someone else,

25:07.506 --> 25:10.291
that's your choice.

25:10.334 --> 25:12.032
But don't delude yourself
into thinking

25:12.075 --> 25:14.425
this is about
following your dreams.

25:14.469 --> 25:16.427
You're following hers.

25:16.471 --> 25:18.995
- You see?
I knew you wouldn't understand.

25:19.909 --> 25:21.694
It is my dream.

25:21.737 --> 25:24.566
- Being on TV?
This is your dream?

25:24.610 --> 25:26.394
A little movie you shoot
on your phone

25:26.437 --> 25:29.919
in some kiosco in Piñones
or Betsi's food truck.

25:29.963 --> 25:32.922
And what, all of a sudden, you
think you're Anthony Bourdain?

25:32.966 --> 25:34.924
If you're so passionate,
fine.

25:34.968 --> 25:37.492
There's a thousand videos
you can shoot right here

25:37.536 --> 25:39.755
starting with your own family.

25:39.799 --> 25:41.583
But you didn't think
of those, did you?

25:42.497 --> 25:44.847
Mateo, he has a dream.

25:44.891 --> 25:45.892
You...

25:47.763 --> 25:49.635
You have a fantasy.

25:51.114 --> 25:52.333
And me?

25:53.943 --> 25:55.815
I have work to do.

26:08.044 --> 26:09.524
- Look at us.

26:11.700 --> 26:14.442
Everything that your father
feared would happen

26:14.485 --> 26:17.445
is happening right now.

26:17.488 --> 26:19.621
And it's all her fault.

26:19.665 --> 26:22.711
- Ma, that's not fair.
- Yes, it is fair.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.974
All that paparazzi outside,

26:25.018 --> 26:30.066
your sister
getting into a fight at school.

26:30.110 --> 26:31.677
- You got into a fight?

26:31.720 --> 26:32.939
- You should see
the other girl.

26:32.982 --> 26:34.984
- Cayate.

26:35.028 --> 26:39.032
And you, running away...

26:42.557 --> 26:45.952
Running away with delusions
of grandeur

26:45.995 --> 26:47.867
and forgetting
about your family.

26:50.086 --> 26:52.088
That is all her fault.

26:53.742 --> 26:55.657
- Her fault?

26:55.701 --> 26:57.659
Mom, I didn't
hear you complaining

26:57.703 --> 26:59.182
when she brought in customers
by the hundreds.

26:59.226 --> 27:00.706
- Daniel, calm down.

27:00.749 --> 27:02.011
- You two think you'd be able
to afford your expansion

27:02.055 --> 27:03.665
had I not met her?

27:03.709 --> 27:05.101
We'd still be barely
getting by.

27:05.145 --> 27:06.799
- Oh, no.
Thomas Gold came here.

27:06.842 --> 27:09.671
- He goes and reviews places
that celebrities have been.

27:09.715 --> 27:11.020
And the last time I checked,

27:11.064 --> 27:12.152
you weren't shy about the fact

27:12.195 --> 27:13.675
that she played your music
at her party.

27:13.719 --> 27:15.155
- Okay,
but when is the last time

27:15.198 --> 27:16.983
our entire family has had
a fight like this, Daniel?

27:20.856 --> 27:24.077
- You guys want to blame
someone, blame Vanessa.

27:24.120 --> 27:28.429
Because everything was fine
until she gave that interview.

27:43.618 --> 27:45.489
- Can you turn, please?

27:45.533 --> 27:48.231
I like it, it's just not
exactly as we planned.

27:48.275 --> 27:50.103
I think the shoulders need
to be bigger, right?

27:50.146 --> 27:52.496
- Yes, bigger shoulders.

27:52.540 --> 27:55.021
And yes, and raise
the dust ruffle.

27:55.761 --> 27:58.024
- Always got your finger
on the pulse, Lewis.

27:58.067 --> 28:00.156
- Pulse? I'm trying to keep
that look from flatlining

28:00.200 --> 28:02.115
like our profit margins.

28:02.158 --> 28:04.595
We have got to take this line
up a notch

28:04.639 --> 28:05.814
if we're going
to protect the company

28:05.858 --> 28:07.207
from a hostile takeover.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.904
- We don't know there's
going to be a takeover.

28:08.948 --> 28:10.123
Maybe the board
is telling the truth.

28:10.166 --> 28:11.777
- Oh, there's gonna be
a hostile takeover.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.169
We just have to figure out

28:13.213 --> 28:15.084
which board members are looking
into our financials.

28:15.128 --> 28:16.172
- Yeah.
- Um, well, you know what?

28:16.216 --> 28:17.347
Will you call accounting
and see

28:17.391 --> 28:19.088
if you can pull
the information requests?

28:19.132 --> 28:20.568
I gotta take this.

28:20.611 --> 28:22.744
- You need a better poker face.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.311
- Excuse me?

28:24.354 --> 28:25.704
- Look, I know you've been
getting a call from a doctor,

28:25.747 --> 28:27.096
and that's fine.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.532
I just--I don't understand
why you're hiding it.

28:28.576 --> 28:31.274
- Piper, it's fine, really.
- Okay.

28:31.318 --> 28:32.580
So no one knows?

28:34.669 --> 28:36.627
Is it bad?

28:41.676 --> 28:44.505
- I have prostate cancer.

28:44.548 --> 28:45.767
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.769
Just what you want
on your Grindr profile, right?

28:47.813 --> 28:49.989
- Lewis, I'm so sorry.
- Don't, please.

28:50.032 --> 28:52.774
I will be fine,

28:52.818 --> 28:54.689
aside from the fact
that most treatment options

28:54.733 --> 28:56.952
come with the possibility
of impotence.

28:56.996 --> 28:59.215
Good news is, you're healthy.

28:59.259 --> 29:01.914
Bad news is,
you'll never have sex again.

29:03.002 --> 29:07.310
Can you imagine me depriving
the world of this gift?

29:13.012 --> 29:15.884
- Luckily,
we found it early, so...

29:15.928 --> 29:19.932
I'm gonna do radiation
and fingers crossed.

29:19.975 --> 29:21.324
- Okay.

29:21.368 --> 29:22.848
So you're gonna tell Noa?

29:22.891 --> 29:24.806
- No.
I mean yes.

29:24.850 --> 29:27.243
I will, just--she has a lot
on her plate right now.

29:27.287 --> 29:29.637
- Lewis, that's ridiculous.
She would want to know--

29:29.680 --> 29:31.813
- Piper, promise me
that you will not tell her.

29:31.857 --> 29:32.945
- How am I--I can't--

29:32.988 --> 29:36.818
- I will tell her
when I'm ready, okay?

29:36.862 --> 29:38.994
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:39.908 --> 29:41.692
- May I?

30:01.277 --> 30:03.758
- What if they kick me out?
- They won't.

30:04.846 --> 30:07.022
- My entire future
could change based on one--

30:07.066 --> 30:09.633
- Listen, listen.
I know it's scary.

30:09.677 --> 30:11.940
It's terrifying, but, you know,
they won't expel you.

30:11.984 --> 30:13.855
- You don't know that.

30:13.899 --> 30:16.640
- You were defending yourself,
okay?

30:16.684 --> 30:18.120
You didn't start it.

30:18.164 --> 30:20.819
- That's true, that's true.

30:22.777 --> 30:23.996
- But you did finish it.

30:27.956 --> 30:30.872
- I mean, that poser went down.

30:30.916 --> 30:33.048
- Yeah, that's my kid sister.

30:33.092 --> 30:34.571
How'd you do it?
- You should've seen it.

30:34.615 --> 30:35.703
I was like, "Can you
come here a second?"

30:35.746 --> 30:36.704
Pow-pow!
Pow-pow!

30:36.747 --> 30:38.053
- Oh, oh!

30:38.097 --> 30:39.881
- Good work. Let me see that.
- It was great.

30:39.925 --> 30:41.100
- Oh, you look so beautiful.

30:41.143 --> 30:44.103
- You should see her.

30:44.146 --> 30:47.758
- Oh, hey, how did that, um,
meeting with that guy go?

30:49.978 --> 30:51.762
- Um--

30:53.852 --> 30:54.940
Were those the workers?

30:54.983 --> 30:56.855
- It sounded like Mom.

30:59.292 --> 31:00.641
- That was Dad, yep.
- That was definitely Dad.

31:03.035 --> 31:05.254
- What is going on?
- I have no idea.

31:05.298 --> 31:06.865
Hey, are you guys okay?

31:06.908 --> 31:08.954
- Otra más, otra más.
- Vamo, vamo!

31:11.739 --> 31:13.262
- Where are the workers?

31:14.176 --> 31:15.743
- The contractor
stole our money.

31:15.786 --> 31:18.137
- What?
- Just the deposit.

31:18.180 --> 31:20.182
- Mami, Papi, I'm so sorry.

31:20.226 --> 31:21.836
- No, no, no, it's okay.
You know why?

31:21.880 --> 31:24.099
Because we are the Garcias.

31:24.143 --> 31:26.058
- Somos los Garcias and we're
gonna do it ourselves.

31:26.101 --> 31:27.886
- Exactly.
- The parts that we can.

31:27.929 --> 31:29.017
- Vamos, Papi.
- Vamos, yeah.

31:29.061 --> 31:31.193
- Your turn first.
Go ahead.

31:31.237 --> 31:34.631
- Hey, you got another one
of those?

31:34.675 --> 31:37.939
- We have one for everyone,
Mamita.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.288
You ready?
- Yeah.

31:39.332 --> 31:40.681
- Take it.
It's heavy.

31:40.724 --> 31:43.205
- Careful.

31:43.249 --> 31:44.250
Oh, you won't be able
to hold this.

31:44.293 --> 31:46.034
- Be careful!

31:46.078 --> 31:47.731
- Come on, Mama.

31:47.775 --> 31:49.864
- Garciadiggers, huh?
- That's right.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.258
- Take that!
- There you go, baby!

31:52.301 --> 31:53.259
Look at that!
- Yes!

31:56.088 --> 31:57.828
- Me too, me too, me too.

31:57.872 --> 31:58.917
- You get it, Mom!

31:58.960 --> 32:00.179
- Yeah, hit it hard,
hit it hard.

32:00.222 --> 32:02.224
- Whoo!
- Vamos, vamos.

32:02.268 --> 32:03.399
Mateo, let's do it!

32:03.443 --> 32:04.966
All right, all right, Mateo,
let's go!

32:05.010 --> 32:06.968
All right, here we--
Oh, come on.

32:07.012 --> 32:08.361
You need to start working out.
- Hold on, hold on, okay?

32:08.404 --> 32:09.753
- You need to start
working out.

32:09.797 --> 32:11.190
- You have to pick it up!

32:11.233 --> 32:13.018
- Come on, Papi.
You need some muscles.

32:15.759 --> 32:16.935
- Oh, my God.

32:19.328 --> 32:20.721
- Whoo!

32:26.379 --> 32:29.251
-  What is that?

32:30.426 --> 32:32.689
Oh, what's that smell?

32:32.733 --> 32:33.821
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

32:33.864 --> 32:34.909
Mateo, give me a hand here.
Come on.

32:34.953 --> 32:35.910
Watch it, watch it, watch it.

32:40.262 --> 32:42.786
- Everybody get out,
get out, get out, get out!

32:48.444 --> 32:50.838
- The thing is, Juliet, you're
one of only two board members

32:50.881 --> 32:52.100
who asked
to see the financials.

32:52.144 --> 32:53.362
- Yes, Tom,
and Piper's on the phone

32:53.406 --> 32:54.450
with the other one right now.

32:54.494 --> 32:56.017
- I just want
to know what's going on.

32:56.061 --> 32:57.671
- Oh, you know that I know
that you know what's going on.

32:57.714 --> 32:59.238
- Okay, well,
then who asked you to do it?

32:59.281 --> 33:01.240
- Mark Logan?
- Mark Logan?

33:01.283 --> 33:02.719
Did he say why?

33:02.763 --> 33:04.852
- An emergency board meeting?
- When?

33:04.895 --> 33:05.984
- Oh, God.

33:06.027 --> 33:07.507
- Juliet,
I gotta call you back.

33:07.550 --> 33:09.161
Are you okay? What's happening?
Do you need a doctor?

33:09.204 --> 33:11.859
- What?
No, no, it's not that.

33:11.902 --> 33:13.426
In order to call
an emergency board meeting,

33:13.469 --> 33:15.254
you need two members
to make a motion.

33:15.297 --> 33:17.430
We already know
that one of them is Mark Logan.

33:17.473 --> 33:20.172
Now, ask yourself,
who is the one person

33:20.215 --> 33:22.000
who would do something
that underhanded

33:22.043 --> 33:23.088
at a time like this?

33:23.131 --> 33:25.090
- We called
all the other board members.

33:25.133 --> 33:27.353
- No, we haven't.

33:28.745 --> 33:31.139
- Oh.
- Yes.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.019
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.807
- Can I come in?

33:49.244 --> 33:51.246
Paparazzi have the bakery
staked out.

33:53.031 --> 33:56.338
Natalie, she's getting
picked on at school.

33:57.470 --> 34:00.299
There's some sort of trouble
at Noa's company.

34:01.430 --> 34:05.260
And me...I'm fighting
with my family.

34:05.304 --> 34:07.306
Is that what you wanted?

34:12.963 --> 34:18.012
- What I wanted was to stop
losing potential clients.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.101
What I wanted was
to be seen for who I am

34:20.145 --> 34:22.103
and not some internet meme.

34:24.801 --> 34:26.368
You think I wanted to hurt you?

34:28.152 --> 34:30.329
I don't know what's worse,

34:30.371 --> 34:32.112
that you could be
that narcissistic

34:32.157 --> 34:34.333
or that you think I'd actually
do something like that.

34:35.985 --> 34:38.076
That might've not been
your intention,

34:38.119 --> 34:39.773
but that's what's happening.

34:39.815 --> 34:41.382
And it all started
with that interview.

34:41.427 --> 34:42.384
- Okay, what do you want me
to do?

34:42.428 --> 34:43.907
- Help me stop it.

34:43.951 --> 34:45.257
Go to the press,
tell them the truth.

34:45.300 --> 34:46.822
- I did tell them the truth!

34:48.347 --> 34:52.481
Everything I said
is exactly what happened.

34:52.525 --> 34:54.918
Now, you may not like
how the truth makes you look,

34:54.962 --> 34:57.399
but mirrors can be cruel
sometimes.

35:01.142 --> 35:05.581
- I shouldn't have come.
- At last, we agree.

35:24.383 --> 35:26.559
- Hey, Daniel!

35:32.652 --> 35:34.262
- Well,
this doesn't look good.

35:41.182 --> 35:45.143
- Does Noa know you're here?
- Dude, are you following me?

35:45.186 --> 35:47.449
- They're putting together
an emergency board meeting,

35:47.493 --> 35:49.059
and at that board meeting,

35:49.103 --> 35:50.452
they're gonna vote

35:50.496 --> 35:53.977
to remove you as president
of your company.

35:58.330 --> 36:00.984
- Remove me?

36:01.028 --> 36:02.029
Who would do that?

36:04.510 --> 36:07.034
My father.

36:10.994 --> 36:12.996
- Which one's better in bed?

36:38.152 --> 36:41.416
- Hey. I missed you.
- I missed you too.

36:42.983 --> 36:44.245
- Mm.

36:44.289 --> 36:45.246
In other words--
- I wanted to--

36:45.290 --> 36:46.247
- Oh.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.293
Can I go first?

36:48.336 --> 36:50.120
- Yeah.

36:50.164 --> 36:52.122
I just wanted
to tell you something

36:52.166 --> 36:53.950
before you found out
from somebody else.

36:53.994 --> 36:56.257
- You punched Kurt Malick.

36:56.301 --> 36:57.476
- I did.

36:58.999 --> 37:00.218
I'm sorry.

37:01.610 --> 37:03.482
It's just a lot.

37:05.135 --> 37:08.400
And I can't believe how well
you handle the pressure

37:08.443 --> 37:13.492
day after day, especially
when they make it so personal.

37:13.535 --> 37:16.886
It feels like you can't--
- Breathe?

37:16.930 --> 37:18.453
- Yeah.

37:23.328 --> 37:26.026
- Daniel, I've had my whole
life to deal with this chaos.

37:26.069 --> 37:28.594
You've had, what, a month?

37:28.637 --> 37:33.163
The truth is, it's not really
fair to you

37:33.207 --> 37:34.600
or your family.

37:44.087 --> 37:46.394
- What's going on?

37:52.052 --> 37:53.880
- Let's take a walk.

37:55.969 --> 37:59.407
- Mrs. Howe,
of course, of course.

37:59.451 --> 38:00.930
Okay, bye-bye.

38:04.064 --> 38:05.457
Suspension.
- Oh, my God.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.937
- But it could've easily
been expulsion.

38:07.981 --> 38:09.069
- I know, I know.

38:09.112 --> 38:10.331
And it will never happen again,
I swear.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.942
- That's right, it won't.

38:12.986 --> 38:17.033
And Amy--did you know she has a
history of disciplinary issues?

38:17.077 --> 38:19.906
- She doesn't have a history
of disciplinary issues, okay?

38:19.949 --> 38:21.603
She got caught TP'ing
the school mascot

38:21.647 --> 38:23.344
with, like, five other girls.

38:23.388 --> 38:26.521
- Oh, so then you admit that
she's been in trouble before.

38:26.565 --> 38:29.263
- Okay?
- "Okay?"

38:29.307 --> 38:30.569
Then you'll understand why

38:30.612 --> 38:33.441
I am forbidding you
from seeing her anymore.

38:33.485 --> 38:35.269
- Uh-uh!

38:43.364 --> 38:44.496
- Well, the gas leak
is repaired,

38:44.539 --> 38:46.541
but that's not your problem.

38:46.585 --> 38:47.890
The problem is, it looks like

38:47.934 --> 38:50.328
you have asbestos
all throughout these walls.

38:50.371 --> 38:51.329
- Asbestos?

38:51.372 --> 38:52.547
- It has to be removed

38:52.591 --> 38:54.157
and the building's gonna have
to be certified.

38:54.201 --> 38:55.681
- How--how long will it take?

38:55.724 --> 38:59.685
- I'd say your bakery can
reopen in about 10 to 12 weeks.

39:01.469 --> 39:03.123
- He wanted to hire me?

39:03.166 --> 39:06.126
- Yeah, why are you acting
so surprised?

39:06.169 --> 39:07.649
He knows how to seek talent,
right?

39:07.693 --> 39:10.435
Consider it.
He's the real deal.

39:12.132 --> 39:14.656
And so are you.

39:16.397 --> 39:19.574
Anyway, just wanted
to let you know.

39:22.316 --> 39:24.144
- To hell with him.

39:24.187 --> 39:27.234
He's wrong about you.

39:27.277 --> 39:29.236
Why would I want
to work with him?

39:31.281 --> 39:34.284
- I appreciate it...

39:34.328 --> 39:36.286
but it's over.

39:39.246 --> 39:42.031
MC Cubano is over.

39:51.476 --> 39:54.435
- My father's trying
to take my company from me.

39:54.479 --> 39:56.698
- What?

39:56.742 --> 40:00.093
- There's a reason why I don't
talk about him a lot.

40:00.136 --> 40:03.444
It's a very painful
relationship.

40:03.488 --> 40:05.664
He only married my mother
because she was pregnant,

40:05.707 --> 40:11.409
and then when she got sick,
he completely abandoned her.

40:13.541 --> 40:16.326
- I was emancipated from him
when I was 16

40:16.370 --> 40:19.547
but not before
I started my company.

40:19.591 --> 40:22.289
- With his money.
- Exactly.

40:22.332 --> 40:25.466
- And ever since then, he's
been able to sit on my board

40:25.510 --> 40:29.252
and have a piece of every
single one of my successes.

40:29.296 --> 40:30.689
- Okay, but it's still
your company.

40:30.732 --> 40:33.213
Why do this?
- Exactly, why?

40:33.256 --> 40:36.303
Why would a father do that
to his daughter?

40:36.346 --> 40:38.305
I don't know.

40:38.348 --> 40:41.047
All I know is that
he senses I'm vulnerable

40:41.090 --> 40:43.092
and he's coming for me.

40:46.618 --> 40:49.795
So what are you gonna do?

40:49.838 --> 40:51.710
- I'm gonna do
what I always do.

40:51.753 --> 40:53.233
I'm gonna fight.

40:53.276 --> 40:55.540
I'm gonna fly to New York,
Los Angeles, and London

40:55.583 --> 40:57.367
and meet with
every single board member

40:57.411 --> 41:00.588
and convince them not
to believe my father's lies.

41:00.632 --> 41:03.591
- You're not only gonna fight,
you're gonna win.

41:03.635 --> 41:05.854
I'm here for you every step
of the way.

41:05.898 --> 41:08.727
I'll go home and pack my bags.

41:10.380 --> 41:13.688
- You're so kind, Daniel.
That's very sweet of you.

42:00.692 --> 42:02.476
- What are you saying?

42:04.696 --> 42:08.482
- I can't be distracted
when I go on this trip.
