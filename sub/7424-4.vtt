Avenue D and Second.

Did you find any evidence
that might help?

No, I just got him
to the ER as fast as I could.

03:58.232 --> 04:00.032
Okay. I'll follow up.

04:11.545 --> 04:12.911
Just throw in the damn ball.

04:12.913 --> 04:14.964
Here.

04:27.194 --> 04:28.561
TESS:
So, who found him?

04:28.563 --> 04:29.928
A Good Sam called it in.

04:29.930 --> 04:31.280
Uh, we get a description?

04:31.282 --> 04:33.115
Of the Good Sam? No,
but I called the hospital.

04:33.117 --> 04:34.483
They're sending over
his personals

04:34.485 --> 04:35.985
and e-mailing his chart.
All right, fine.

04:35.987 --> 04:38.537
But you're not getting
out of the game.

04:38.539 --> 04:40.439
Okay, Tommy Holt, age 19.

04:40.441 --> 04:41.624
No phone.

04:41.626 --> 04:43.626
Wallet's still
got cash in it.

04:43.628 --> 04:45.211
This wasn't a robbery.

04:45.213 --> 04:46.795
Ooh, who's this hottie?

04:46.797 --> 04:48.497
It says here
they took him

04:48.499 --> 04:51.000
into surgery
for a depressive... crania...

04:51.002 --> 04:54.286
EVAN:
Decompressive craniectomy.

04:54.288 --> 04:56.555
It means they took
pressure off his brain.

04:56.557 --> 04:58.057
Thank God you're here.
Can you keep translating?

04:58.059 --> 05:00.009
I do not understand
a word of this.

05:00.011 --> 05:01.927
Wow, another thing
you don't do well.

05:01.929 --> 05:03.812
Huh.

05:03.814 --> 05:05.898
Okay, so he's in a coma.

05:05.900 --> 05:08.150
Only periodic discharges
on the EEG

05:08.152 --> 05:10.302
means this may be
a homicide soon.

05:10.304 --> 05:13.756
It says possible history
of abuse or assault.

05:13.758 --> 05:16.442
X-rays showed his bones
have been fractured

05:16.444 --> 05:18.160
repeatedly over
the last few years.

05:18.162 --> 05:20.029
Maybe an abusive parent
or sibling.

05:20.031 --> 05:22.698
Nurse I talked to said that his
dad was on his way over there.

05:22.700 --> 05:24.483
Sounds like we should
get him over here.

05:24.485 --> 05:27.136
Yeah.

05:27.138 --> 05:29.154
MAN:
<i>They're from fights.</i>

05:29.156 --> 05:30.956
He used to get in them a lot.

05:30.958 --> 05:32.157
Thank you.

05:32.159 --> 05:33.825
With whom?

05:36.329 --> 05:37.763
Kids at school.

05:37.765 --> 05:39.148
Neighborhood.

05:39.150 --> 05:41.100
It's been tough
ever since his mom died.

05:41.102 --> 05:43.135
TESS:
Do you mind

05:43.137 --> 05:44.603
telling us where you were
earlier today?

05:44.605 --> 05:46.639
I was at the airport,
heading to Baltimore

05:46.641 --> 05:48.307
for a story assignment.

05:48.309 --> 05:52.278
Wait... you think I had
something to do with this?

05:52.280 --> 05:54.179
Mr. Holt, about
those fights.

05:54.181 --> 05:57.283
You said that
Tommy was "over that."

05:57.285 --> 05:58.567
What did you mean?

05:58.569 --> 06:00.869
My son has severe ADHD.

06:00.871 --> 06:02.321
When he's not
taking his meds,

06:02.323 --> 06:03.889
he has no impulse control.

06:03.891 --> 06:05.824
He's gotten himself
in a lot of trouble.

06:05.826 --> 06:09.712
Even ended up in a residential
treatment program for a year.

06:09.714 --> 06:11.297
Besides fighting,

06:11.299 --> 06:12.664
what kind of trouble
did he get into?

06:12.689 --> 06:14.167
You name it.

06:14.168 --> 06:17.052
B-and-E's, uh,
online gambling...

06:17.054 --> 06:18.203
Is he off his meds now?

06:18.205 --> 06:20.306
I... (sighs)

06:20.308 --> 06:21.873
I don't know.

06:21.875 --> 06:23.892
I-I went in his room.

06:23.894 --> 06:25.761
I saw a brand-new Xbox.

06:25.763 --> 06:28.347
He was wearing a fancy watch
the other day.

06:28.349 --> 06:31.016
I tried to talk to him, but...

06:31.018 --> 06:33.385
He told me he was working
on something

06:33.387 --> 06:35.187
that was going to make me proud.

06:38.391 --> 06:40.075
I just wish he would wake up.

06:40.077 --> 06:42.995
You know, and tell me
what it is.

06:42.997 --> 06:45.364
We have three working theories.
One, abusive dad.

06:45.366 --> 06:47.833
No record,
but according to colleagues,

06:47.835 --> 06:50.586
he has a reputation
of being a hothead.

06:50.588 --> 06:53.505
We're following up on his alibi.
And Wallet Girl is number two?

06:53.507 --> 06:55.507
Well, we don't have his
cell phone, so I.T.'s trying

06:55.509 --> 06:56.875
to get access
to his e-mail,

06:56.877 --> 06:58.293
see if there's any
suggestion of a

06:58.295 --> 07:01.430
relationship gone bad.
And three, maybe Tommy

07:01.432 --> 07:03.298
got himself into trouble again.
We're waiting to hear

07:03.300 --> 07:05.684
back from tox to see
if he was taking his meds.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.419
Great. Chandler,
head to the vic's apartment.

07:07.421 --> 07:08.554
Vargas, morgue.

07:08.556 --> 07:10.389
TESS:
You're splitting us up?

07:10.391 --> 07:11.757
It's called
"divide and conquer."

07:11.759 --> 07:13.392
See, that way, you can wake up

07:13.394 --> 07:14.810
for an early morning practice.

07:14.812 --> 07:16.362
Does he have money
on this game or something?

07:16.364 --> 07:17.429
JOE (sighs):
No.

07:17.431 --> 07:19.097
Pride, okay?

07:19.099 --> 07:20.866
This about the whole precinct.

07:20.868 --> 07:21.984
It's about you, too.

07:21.986 --> 07:23.769
Now, be her coach.
Joe...

07:23.771 --> 07:25.237
Go, team.

07:27.607 --> 07:30.743
Hey.

07:32.779 --> 07:35.214
I'm not even gonna ask.
I just found a kid

07:35.216 --> 07:37.249
beaten unconscious
in a Dumpster.

07:37.251 --> 07:38.917
And what, you're gonna
operate on him?

07:38.919 --> 07:41.220
That's cool.
No, he's at the hospital.

07:41.222 --> 07:44.506
Catherine just asked
if there was any evidence.

07:51.231 --> 07:52.898
I'm just helping out, okay?

07:52.900 --> 07:54.900
You know what?
And for once,

07:54.902 --> 07:58.604
JT, I almost feel normal.

07:58.606 --> 08:01.106
Okay, I got to stop
you there. Normal?

08:01.108 --> 08:03.342
Like... like you could put on
a pair of rubber gloves

08:03.344 --> 08:04.827
and head off to work
for the day?

08:04.829 --> 08:07.913
She may have you feeling
almost normal, big guy,

08:07.915 --> 08:09.648
but Muirfield doesn't agree.

08:09.650 --> 08:12.367
You are still their experiment
that went awry,

08:12.369 --> 08:15.120
and they are never going
to stop hunting you down...

08:15.122 --> 08:17.256
Hunting me down,
yeah, okay, I get it.

08:17.258 --> 08:18.924
You're gonna give
yourself an ulcer.

08:18.926 --> 08:20.709
I'm gonna go
help Cat.

08:20.711 --> 08:24.546
If anything happens
to you, that's on her.

Oh, I think you do.

In fact, you're the one who
found his cross-species DNA

09:32.816 --> 09:36.067
at a crime scene a few weeks ago
and called the FBI to report it.

09:36.069 --> 09:37.986
It was corrupted.
I was wrong.

09:37.988 --> 09:42.824
Magna cum laude at Princeton,
top marks at the academy.

09:42.826 --> 09:44.993
You're not wrong about much.

09:48.715 --> 09:50.465
I'm not

09:50.467 --> 09:53.668
I'm trying to protect
the citizens of this city.

09:53.670 --> 09:57.588
While you're choosing
to protect a monster.

09:57.590 --> 09:59.540
And that's what he is.

09:59.542 --> 10:01.009
Not a man.

10:01.011 --> 10:02.593
He's a monster.

10:02.595 --> 10:05.930
Your people sent him off to
war to be a killing machine.

10:05.932 --> 10:08.232
It's ten years later;
he's not that anymore.

10:08.234 --> 10:10.551
I see your amnesia
is clearing up.

10:10.553 --> 10:11.686
Yeah.

10:11.688 --> 10:12.937

10:12.939 --> 10:14.272
You and your
Muirfield assassins

10:14.274 --> 10:16.357

(ticking)

10:57.966 --> 10:59.817
Check this out.

11:01.120 --> 11:05.323
This was an unsanctioned
attack on an Afghan village.

11:05.325 --> 11:08.609
The population before
the attack was 500.

11:08.611 --> 11:12.880
After the attack... zero.

11:12.882 --> 11:15.717
That was what
you programmed him to do.

11:15.719 --> 11:18.002
Is that how you're going

11:18.004 --> 11:19.158
He saves people.

11:19.183 --> 11:21.389
I know it's romantic

11:21.391 --> 11:23.674

protective beast,

11:23.676 --> 11:26.127

11:26.129 --> 11:27.895

the local bar.

11:32.268 --> 11:33.851
Was he not innocent

11:33.853 --> 11:36.471
because he chose
to have a cocktail?

11:37.940 --> 11:39.741
No, this can't be real.

11:39.743 --> 11:42.260
You know it's real
because you've seen it.

11:42.262 --> 11:44.478
He can't control it.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.080
Do you really think

11:46.082 --> 11:49.250
that we would pour this many
resources into finding him

11:49.252 --> 11:52.820
if he wasn't
absolutely lethal?

11:55.791 --> 11:58.159
Where is she?

11:58.161 --> 11:59.627
What, the Jane Doe
from last night?

11:59.629 --> 12:01.262
In the freezer next door.
No. Cat.

12:01.264 --> 12:04.048
I can't find her. She's
not answering her phone.

12:04.050 --> 12:05.466
She's probably cowering
in humiliation

12:05.468 --> 12:07.351
after that performance tonight.
Probably.

12:07.353 --> 12:09.020
Although I had a more salacious
theory that I'd walk in

12:09.022 --> 12:10.855
and find you two together
on the autopsy table.

12:10.857 --> 12:13.191
Wouldn't be great on the back.
Speaking of...

12:13.193 --> 12:16.027
Tommy's got abrasions on his
from the cuts in his shirt.

12:16.029 --> 12:17.612
Probably from
being dragged.

12:17.614 --> 12:19.313
CSU didn't find
any blood in the alley,

12:19.315 --> 12:21.182
so he was probably moved
from another location.

12:21.184 --> 12:22.784
I'm looking into the soil
on his clothes.

12:22.786 --> 12:24.652
Now look at this.

12:24.654 --> 12:28.206
Check out these contusions.
Tommy's body is covered in them.

12:28.208 --> 12:29.490
Same shape, same size.

12:29.492 --> 12:31.109
What did you say
the father does?

12:31.111 --> 12:33.327
Journalist. He couldn't
have done that with a pen.

12:33.329 --> 12:35.329
Or a fist.
It's just lately she's been

12:35.331 --> 12:37.298
disappearing and then she comes
back with this great insight

12:37.300 --> 12:40.218
on a case, and I just figured it was...
Tess, we work together.

12:40.220 --> 12:43.537
So, unless you're online dating,
that's where people meet-- work.

12:43.539 --> 12:44.672
I meet people lots of places.

12:44.674 --> 12:46.307
Oh, and...

12:46.309 --> 12:49.393
toxicology came back
positive for ADHD medicine.

12:49.395 --> 12:51.145
Okay, well, there goes
the office meds theory.

12:51.147 --> 12:54.065
As for the Chandler-Marks
theory, I'm not letting it go.

12:54.067 --> 12:56.484
SILVERFOX:
<i>We don't want to hurt him.</i>

12:56.486 --> 12:59.553
We just want to bring him
to a place where...

12:59.555 --> 13:01.989
he won't be a danger to anyone.

13:01.991 --> 13:03.441
You just want
to clean up your mess.

13:03.443 --> 13:04.709
No, we want
to fix it.

13:04.711 --> 13:06.227
Perhaps find him
an antidote.

13:06.229 --> 13:08.496
That's why you sent
all those hit men after me.

13:08.498 --> 13:10.698
Clearly the wrong tactic.

13:10.700 --> 13:13.584
All right, I'll
make you a deal.

13:14.853 --> 13:16.704
Your mother.

13:19.124 --> 13:21.575
For ten years, you've been
searching for the truth

13:21.577 --> 13:23.361
about what happened to her

13:23.363 --> 13:24.712
the night she was killed.

13:24.714 --> 13:27.465
You bring me Vincent...

13:30.085 --> 13:32.720
...I'll tell you everything.

13:32.722 --> 13:36.724
This is a picture of your mother
at our headquarters.

13:36.726 --> 13:40.728
And as far as Vincent goes,
if you don't believe me,

13:40.730 --> 13:42.763
you mention these incidents
I told you about.

13:42.765 --> 13:44.198
Ask him yourself.

13:44.200 --> 13:48.953
This number will be good
for the next three days.

13:48.955 --> 13:50.404
I'm not going to follow you,

13:50.406 --> 13:52.707
but if I don't hear
from you by then,

13:52.709 --> 13:57.662
I'm going to have to go back
to the wrong tactics.

14:08.347 --> 14:09.565
(cell phone ringing)

14:18.341 --> 14:19.875
(thud)

14:35.308 --> 14:36.857
Vincent, what are
you doing here?

14:36.858 --> 14:38.775
You asked if there
was any evidence.

14:38.777 --> 14:41.510
Get inside.
Why? What's going on?

14:41.512 --> 14:43.179
Get inside.

14:43.181 --> 14:45.648
Okay, get away from the window.

14:45.650 --> 14:48.184
Muirfield grabbed me.

14:48.186 --> 14:50.203
What?
They pulled me into a car,

14:50.205 --> 14:51.871
took me to some...

14:51.873 --> 14:53.940
It's okay.

14:53.942 --> 14:55.959
I'm fine.
They didn't hurt me.

14:55.961 --> 14:59.212
You don't seem fine.

15:04.351 --> 15:06.052
They know you're alive.

15:06.054 --> 15:08.154
They wanted me
to tell them where you are.

15:08.156 --> 15:09.505
I-I didn't--
obviously.

15:09.507 --> 15:12.709
And that was it.
And they just let you go?

15:12.711 --> 15:15.678
Probably thought that if they
tracked me, they'd find you.

15:15.680 --> 15:18.047
I made sure I wasn't followed,
but still, you should go.

15:18.049 --> 15:19.232
I'm not going now, okay?

15:19.234 --> 15:21.567
You just got nabbed
because of me.

15:21.569 --> 15:23.019
It's my fault, too.

15:23.021 --> 15:24.771
You kept telling me
to stay away, and I...

15:24.773 --> 15:26.656
and I didn't,
and now they know about you.

15:26.658 --> 15:29.642
I know you want
to protect me,

15:29.644 --> 15:32.245
but you know as well as I do--
better than I do--

15:32.247 --> 15:35.198
that the best way
to protect me is to stay away.

15:37.567 --> 15:42.372
Uh... uh, I came here
because I found a watch

15:42.374 --> 15:44.257
next to the Dumpster.

15:44.259 --> 15:46.242
The cops, they have it now.

15:46.244 --> 15:48.795
Tommy. You saved Tommy.

15:48.797 --> 15:51.447
His dad mentioned a watch.

15:51.449 --> 15:52.799
Are you sure you're okay?

15:52.801 --> 15:54.467
Yeah, I'm okay.

15:54.469 --> 15:56.052
You need to go.

15:56.054 --> 15:57.887
Thank you.

15:57.889 --> 16:00.390
That information will help me
find whoever it is

16:00.392 --> 16:01.724
that assaulted him.

16:01.726 --> 16:04.444
(sighs)

16:26.300 --> 16:27.583
There you are.

16:27.585 --> 16:29.452
You are completely
avoiding your fears.

16:30.504 --> 16:32.055
Practice 6:00 a.m.?

16:32.057 --> 16:34.357
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
I totally forgot.

16:34.359 --> 16:36.125
I just... I've been working
on our case.

16:36.127 --> 16:37.593
Tommy's dad, he alibied out.

16:37.595 --> 16:39.595
We got a receipt
from Ruby's Diner at Newark.

16:39.597 --> 16:41.147
So who's Simon?

16:41.149 --> 16:42.765
Oh, no,

16:42.767 --> 16:44.317
I'm just on this page
for the ad.

16:44.319 --> 16:45.801
Balloons? What, are
you gonna throw

16:45.803 --> 16:47.470
the firefighters a party
when they beat us?

16:47.472 --> 16:48.804
I agreed to help

16:48.806 --> 16:50.823
my dad's fiancée
with her bridal shower.

16:52.159 --> 16:54.277
Uh, but, CSU tracked this down.

16:54.279 --> 16:56.946
I tracked the
serial number.

16:56.948 --> 16:59.532
Leads to a jeweler
in Westchester.

16:59.534 --> 17:01.117
Purchased by a
Lois Whitworth,

17:01.119 --> 17:03.453
president of the
Hawkshire Polo Club.

17:03.455 --> 17:04.954
Westchester?

17:04.955 --> 17:06.856
You and your boyfriend Evan
are completely in sync.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.125
He's not my boyfriend.
Really? Because he told me

17:09.127 --> 17:10.760
the dirt found
on Tommy's clothing

17:10.762 --> 17:13.012
contains phosphorus levels
unique to Westchester.

17:13.013 --> 17:14.964
And all in that
charming British accent.

17:14.965 --> 17:16.799
That must be where
the assault happened.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.469
Tommy's dad, he mentioned that
residential recovery program.

17:19.471 --> 17:23.005
Maybe it's there.
Yeah, you know,

17:23.007 --> 17:24.773
real athletes, they're
not supposed to have sex

17:24.776 --> 17:26.943
on the day of the big game,
but in your case,

17:26.944 --> 17:28.111
I think it might help.

17:28.113 --> 17:29.678
Okay, I will practice.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.131
But for now, can we just
focus on this case?

17:32.133 --> 17:33.649
I'm focusing. Look.

17:33.651 --> 17:35.851
"Achieve to Ride" Program
for Troubled Teens,

17:35.853 --> 17:37.820
run by Lois Whitworth.

17:37.822 --> 17:39.972
Watch Lady.

17:51.752 --> 17:53.920
(door opens and closes)

17:53.922 --> 17:55.805
JT:
You're home-- good.

17:55.807 --> 17:58.424
Got you that book
you wanted. Used my...

17:58.426 --> 18:01.677
Bio-chem Professor of the
Semester gift certificate.

18:01.679 --> 18:04.564
JT, I think you need
to sit down.

18:06.733 --> 18:09.902
Look, I didn't mean to
burst your bubble earlier.

18:09.904 --> 18:11.237
Here, drink.

18:11.239 --> 18:12.738
I'm not saying

18:12.740 --> 18:14.907
you can never leave
this place...

18:14.909 --> 18:16.025
Muirfield took Catherine.

18:16.027 --> 18:18.194
I'm sorry, what?

18:18.196 --> 18:19.495
He asked her to give us up.

18:19.497 --> 18:21.030
To give me up.

18:21.032 --> 18:23.082
Oh, my God.

18:23.084 --> 18:24.733
Oh, my God, uh...

18:24.735 --> 18:26.335
What did they do to her?

18:26.337 --> 18:27.903
Is-is she dead?
No.

18:27.905 --> 18:29.372
She is fine, okay?

18:29.374 --> 18:31.740
She told them that
she does not know anything.

18:31.742 --> 18:33.759
I'm confused.

18:33.761 --> 18:35.595
Muirfield took her,
she said,

18:35.597 --> 18:38.131
"I don't know anything," and
then they just let her go?

18:38.133 --> 18:40.850
Look, I guess they need her
alive to find me.

18:40.852 --> 18:42.552
We got to go.
We got to move.

18:42.554 --> 18:43.919
Like-like movemove, like,

18:43.921 --> 18:45.555
out of here.
I can't

18:45.557 --> 18:47.607
just leave her now.

18:47.609 --> 18:50.026
She's not what they're after.
Us leaving

18:50.028 --> 18:51.727
makes things safer
for her, and-and

18:51.729 --> 18:54.564
safer for us,
if-if she's giving us up.

18:54.566 --> 18:56.599
She is not gonna
give us up.

18:56.601 --> 18:58.067
Until they break her down

18:58.069 --> 19:00.086
and water-board our address
right out of her.

19:00.088 --> 19:02.505
Staying here,
we're sitting ducks.

19:02.507 --> 19:06.125
You're the one who's been
spurned into action, so act.

19:06.127 --> 19:09.245
This is it. We-we got to press
the eject button of our lives.

19:09.247 --> 19:11.947
Okay, you're right.

19:11.949 --> 19:15.251
I got to do something.

19:15.253 --> 19:16.335
Where are you going?

19:16.337 --> 19:18.287
We need to pack.

19:18.289 --> 19:20.122
Like, now.

19:23.594 --> 19:25.394
TESS:
<i>Again.</i>

19:25.396 --> 19:27.897
Seriously?

19:27.899 --> 19:29.515
There is a boy unconscious
in the hospital,

19:29.517 --> 19:31.767
and we are...
Multitasking! Look,

19:31.769 --> 19:32.902
it's not like there's
a serial killer

19:32.904 --> 19:35.304
on the loose.
(phone rings)

19:35.306 --> 19:36.972
Now what?

19:36.974 --> 19:39.325
Never mind.

19:39.327 --> 19:42.028
Joe says FDNY is uptown
right now practicing.

19:42.030 --> 19:44.030
I got to scout their pitcher.

19:44.032 --> 19:46.332
You cannot just leave me here.
Uh, the hell I can't.

19:46.334 --> 19:47.983
Keep your weight back.
Good luck.

19:47.985 --> 19:50.786
Mmm.

20:02.049 --> 20:03.832
What are you doing here?
I thought...

20:03.834 --> 20:05.184
Muirfield-- when they took you,

20:05.186 --> 20:07.803
did you get a license plate
or an address?

20:07.805 --> 20:09.222
What?

20:09.224 --> 20:11.173
Anything to track them.

20:12.342 --> 20:14.694
They gave me a card.

20:14.696 --> 20:17.046
It's at home... What are you
going to do with it?

20:17.048 --> 20:19.815
Catherine, I don't buy
that they just let you go.

20:19.817 --> 20:22.017
Okay, I don't know
what's going on,

20:22.019 --> 20:23.953
but they will have a plan.

20:23.955 --> 20:25.488
They will come back,
and when they do,

20:25.490 --> 20:26.906
they will probably hurt you.

20:26.908 --> 20:28.958
I can defend myself.
You don't need to.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.026
So, I can help
a kid in a Dumpster,

20:31.028 --> 20:33.045
but I can't help you?

20:33.047 --> 20:35.164
How are you going to help?

20:35.166 --> 20:39.051
I'm gonna find them
and I am gonna stop them.

20:39.053 --> 20:40.836
By killing more people?

20:44.441 --> 20:46.826
When they took me,
they showed me photos.

20:46.828 --> 20:50.563
Articles with...
with victims.

20:50.565 --> 20:53.933
They weren't just guys
from Muirfield or...

20:53.935 --> 20:56.519
casualties of war there.

20:57.771 --> 21:00.706
There was a guy
behind a bar.

21:00.708 --> 21:02.191
That was five years ago.

21:02.193 --> 21:04.493
He had a woman, okay?

21:04.495 --> 21:05.861
He was holding her down...

21:05.863 --> 21:07.896
I didn't realize
there were civilians.

21:07.898 --> 21:09.231
(stammers)

21:09.233 --> 21:11.250
(sighs)

21:14.838 --> 21:16.905
You're afraid of me.

21:17.791 --> 21:19.342
Last night,

21:19.344 --> 21:21.761
I thought it was Muirfield,
but it's me.

21:21.763 --> 21:24.347
Understand that I am a cop.

21:24.349 --> 21:27.082
I put people like you away.

21:28.685 --> 21:33.189
You're trying to decide
if I belong in a cage.

(indistinct chatter)

22:39.788 --> 22:41.755
TESS:
If this is where

22:41.757 --> 22:43.957
they send troubled teens,
where do I sign up?

22:43.959 --> 22:45.509
CATHERINE:
Look at these people.

22:45.511 --> 22:47.878
Practicing their sport.
Not a care in the world.

22:47.880 --> 22:49.930
Getting really
good at it.

22:49.932 --> 22:52.433
No big decisions to make.
Oh, my God, don't tell me

22:52.435 --> 22:54.101
this is about what
balloons to pick

22:54.103 --> 22:55.636
for your step-monster's
bridal shower.

22:55.638 --> 22:57.638
Hey, you're still talking
about softball.

22:57.640 --> 23:00.391
And now I'm talking
about polo.

23:00.393 --> 23:02.192
Look at the end of this.

23:02.194 --> 23:05.813
It's the same shape
as Tommy's bruises.

23:10.201 --> 23:12.619
WOMAN:
You must be the detectives.

23:12.621 --> 23:16.073
I'm Lois Whitworth, president
of the Hawkshire Polo Club

23:16.075 --> 23:18.292
and the Achieve to Ride Program.

23:18.294 --> 23:20.994
How's Tommy?
He's in a coma.

23:20.996 --> 23:23.047
Oh, my God.
I was gonna go visit him

23:23.049 --> 23:25.416
at the hospital today,
but I didn't want to intrude.

23:25.418 --> 23:27.017
Sounds like you were close.
Ah, people

23:27.019 --> 23:29.169
send us their children;
they become our children.

23:29.171 --> 23:31.422
It's just heartbreaking
that we can't control

23:31.424 --> 23:32.890
what happens
outside of our cocoon.

23:32.892 --> 23:34.141
Your cocoon have
security cameras?

23:34.143 --> 23:35.959
Uh, only in the clubhouse.

23:35.961 --> 23:38.345
But I thought this happened in the city.
Actually, we have reason

23:38.347 --> 23:39.596
to believe it
happened here.

23:39.598 --> 23:41.181
What?
Tommy's dad mentioned

23:41.183 --> 23:42.322
that he finished the
program six months ago,

23:42.323 --> 23:43.707
but do you know if he was
still coming up here?

23:43.732 --> 23:44.320
Yeah.

23:44.321 --> 23:46.204
He did so well,
we put him on payroll.

23:46.206 --> 23:48.924
He would, uh, clean the stalls,
maintain the grounds.

23:48.926 --> 23:50.926
He actually played
quite a bit of the sport.

23:50.928 --> 23:54.129
He was very good.
He have any rivals, enemies?

23:54.131 --> 23:56.732
No, not out here. We're a
very close, loving community.

23:56.734 --> 23:59.551
So close that
she gave him this?

23:59.553 --> 24:01.169
That's a pretty
nice watch.

24:01.171 --> 24:03.405
No, this is my husband's.
Where did you get this?

24:03.407 --> 24:05.057
He didn't notice
it was missing?

24:05.059 --> 24:06.692
He passed away two years ago.

24:06.694 --> 24:09.177
So he stole it?

24:10.563 --> 24:12.147
(sighs)
I don't know.

24:12.149 --> 24:13.782
This is the hard part of my job.

24:13.784 --> 24:16.835
You take in a kid like Tommy,
with all of his issues,

24:16.837 --> 24:19.687
you think you're
making a difference, but...

24:19.689 --> 24:21.656
Maybe he was back
to his old ways.

24:21.658 --> 24:24.626
If he stole from me, he could
have stolen from anyone.

24:24.628 --> 24:26.361
Do you recognize her?

24:26.363 --> 24:27.963
Yeah, this is
my daughter.

24:27.965 --> 24:29.214
Why?
Were she and Tommy

24:29.216 --> 24:30.665
in a relationship?

24:30.667 --> 24:32.334
No. She has a boyfriend.

24:32.336 --> 24:33.668
You don't think this has

24:33.670 --> 24:35.504
something to do with her,
do you?

24:37.724 --> 24:41.643
He didn't steal my dad's watch--
I gave it to him.

24:41.645 --> 24:44.379
I thought I was
in love with him.

24:44.381 --> 24:46.047
But you didn't tell anybody?

24:46.049 --> 24:48.567
Your mom didn't know--
she thinks you have a boyfriend.

24:48.569 --> 24:49.985
Sean Hyland?

24:49.987 --> 24:52.437
Yeah, she has us
walking down the aisle,

24:52.439 --> 24:55.323
but... I broke up with Sean,
like, three months ago.

24:55.325 --> 24:57.743
How'd he feel about
you and Tommy?

24:57.745 --> 24:59.611
I don't know if he knew, either.

24:59.613 --> 25:02.030
MAN: Come on, Whiskers, let's go.
(sighs)

25:02.032 --> 25:04.916
Look, Tommy was
part of the program.

25:04.918 --> 25:07.569
I guess I just felt like
everyone would have disapproved.

25:07.571 --> 25:08.837
I mean,

25:08.839 --> 25:11.289
he has a lot of baggage
and a record.

25:11.291 --> 25:13.592
I just didn't want
to hear about it.

25:13.594 --> 25:16.077
You said you <i>were</i> in love
with Tommy-- past tense.

25:16.079 --> 25:17.846
What happened?

25:17.848 --> 25:21.583
What happened is, a tiger
doesn't change their stripes.

25:21.585 --> 25:24.219
Turns out he was doping horses.

25:24.221 --> 25:25.804
What do you mean?

25:25.806 --> 25:27.255
He was
injecting them

25:27.257 --> 25:31.059
with steroids and then
betting on polo matches.

25:31.061 --> 25:32.811
Sounds like a good way
to piss people off.

25:32.813 --> 25:34.029
Anyone else know about it?

25:34.031 --> 25:35.464
I don't know.

25:35.466 --> 25:37.199
I mean, I was
oblivious

25:37.201 --> 25:39.651
until I found out he
had done it to Whiskers.

25:39.653 --> 25:41.069
When was that?

25:41.071 --> 25:42.120
Like...

25:42.122 --> 25:43.905
a week ago.

25:43.907 --> 25:45.073
That's a pretty recent betrayal.

25:45.075 --> 25:46.875
Where were you two nights ago?

25:46.877 --> 25:48.076
Home.

25:48.078 --> 25:51.779
Weeping into a bowl
of ice cream.

25:51.781 --> 25:53.615
I just feel
so stupid.

25:53.617 --> 25:56.168
"Achieve to Ride
for Troubled Teens."

25:56.170 --> 25:58.587
He came with
his own warning label.

25:58.589 --> 26:00.355
How did I not see it?

26:00.357 --> 26:03.975
I think most of
us can relate.

26:04.844 --> 26:06.794
Vincent?

26:08.681 --> 26:10.298
Vincent!

26:12.351 --> 26:14.269
Seriously, dude,

26:14.271 --> 26:17.522
today is not the day
to screw with me.

26:23.112 --> 26:25.113
Unless they got to you.

26:25.115 --> 26:28.116
CATHERINE: <i>So, listen to this--</i>
<i>not only is Sean Hyland</i>

26:28.118 --> 26:30.652
a scorned ex whose family
is worth millions,

26:30.654 --> 26:33.455
he's also the president of the
club's disciplinary committee.

26:33.457 --> 26:35.373
They have a
disciplinary committee?

26:35.375 --> 26:37.092
They have entire meetings

26:37.094 --> 26:38.543
devoted to gambling.

26:38.545 --> 26:41.329
Maybe he caught Tommy violating
his "rich boy" code,

26:41.331 --> 26:43.348
took discipline
into his own hands.

26:43.350 --> 26:44.832
What?

26:44.834 --> 26:46.268
No.
Sean?

26:46.270 --> 26:48.103
But had I,
I would have.

26:48.105 --> 26:50.355
TESS: Doesn't sound like
you're too fond of him.

26:50.357 --> 26:52.366
Was that 'cause he was
with your ex-girlfriend?

26:52.391 --> 26:53.208
Was he?

26:53.769 --> 26:55.849
I guess that's why she didn't
text me back this weekend.

26:55.850 --> 26:58.434
Texting her? Does that mean
you wanted to get back together?

26:58.436 --> 27:00.569
Look, even if I did,
I wouldn't have to kill Tommy

27:00.571 --> 27:03.105
to get him out of the picture.
What do you mean?

27:03.107 --> 27:05.614
He was leaving.
Decided to move to Florida.

27:05.639 --> 27:07.526
How do you know?

27:07.527 --> 27:08.744
He gave me his polo jersey,

27:08.746 --> 27:10.195
told me to find someone else.

27:11.865 --> 27:13.282
Look, I didn't get it.

27:13.284 --> 27:14.867
A kid from that
tax write-off program

27:14.869 --> 27:17.069
makes <i>our</i> team
and decides to leave?

27:17.071 --> 27:18.420
I mean, come on.

27:18.422 --> 27:20.405
(phone rings)

27:20.407 --> 27:23.342
This is Chandler.

27:23.344 --> 27:25.094
So they drop a little water
on your forehead,

27:25.096 --> 27:26.178
and you fold like an accordion.

27:26.180 --> 27:28.130
JT?

27:28.132 --> 27:30.916
I swear to God,
they touch him, I will...

27:30.918 --> 27:32.268
Okay,

27:32.270 --> 27:33.919
what is going on?
What happened?

27:37.190 --> 27:39.725
Forget the last five seconds
of this conversation.

27:39.727 --> 27:42.111
I didn't understand
the last five seconds.

27:42.113 --> 27:43.896
Where's Vincent?

27:45.431 --> 27:47.816
He turned himself in.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.288
What?

28:07.754 --> 28:10.622
I hear you've
been looking for me.

28:12.342 --> 28:14.960
I'm ready to come back.

28:18.899 --> 28:22.785
Anything?
No, just rings. He left this.

28:25.021 --> 28:26.471
"Proof I existed"?
Insurance.

28:26.473 --> 28:28.552
In case something happens to us,
I'm supposed to send it out

28:28.553 --> 28:30.686
to the world.
I had their phone number.

28:30.688 --> 28:33.022
And you lost it?
I left it

28:33.024 --> 28:35.525
in my apartment--
he probably took it.

28:35.527 --> 28:37.560
Great. Now what do we do?
I didn't see

28:37.562 --> 28:39.178
the plates on the SUV;
there was no address

28:39.180 --> 28:40.363
at the warehouse.

28:40.365 --> 28:42.782
(sighs)
My car.

28:46.353 --> 28:48.070
Makeup? Now?

28:48.072 --> 28:49.956
Really?
I need chalk.

28:49.958 --> 28:52.074
There was another agent;
he drove my car.

28:52.076 --> 28:55.378
He must have left prints--
all we need to do is lift them,

28:55.380 --> 28:57.413
send them through the system,
track his phone,

28:57.415 --> 28:59.799
and then we're there.
He'll be dead by then.

28:59.801 --> 29:01.717
Do you have a better idea?

29:01.719 --> 29:04.337
♪

29:14.481 --> 29:17.600
(phone rings)

29:17.602 --> 29:19.185
Hello, Vincent.

29:19.187 --> 29:20.987
It's been a long time.

29:20.989 --> 29:22.772
Welcome home.

29:22.774 --> 29:25.608
That's a lot of weapons you
got there for a welcome home.

29:25.610 --> 29:27.159
Just a precaution.

29:27.161 --> 29:28.911
We weren't certain
what state you'd be in.

29:28.913 --> 29:33.082
Before I come in,
I have some terms.

29:33.084 --> 29:34.700
I'm listening.

29:34.702 --> 29:36.202
You never harm

29:36.204 --> 29:39.005
Catherine Chandler again,
you hear me?

29:39.007 --> 29:41.624
Muirfield forgets she exists.

29:41.626 --> 29:43.793
My bosses don't know she does;
I never told them.

29:43.795 --> 29:45.461
Somehow I don't believe you.

29:45.463 --> 29:48.931
The fact that an officer
of the law found out about you

29:48.933 --> 29:51.434
wouldn't make me look too good
to the company.

29:51.436 --> 29:53.019
But just in case,

29:53.021 --> 29:54.387
I've drawn my blood.

29:54.389 --> 29:56.222
Anything happens to her...

29:56.224 --> 29:57.890
A fail-safe.

29:57.892 --> 29:59.859
Ah, ten years on the run's

29:59.861 --> 30:02.278
destroyed your ability
to trust, I see.

30:02.280 --> 30:04.096
I mean, isn't that
why we're really here?

30:04.098 --> 30:06.866
You're not scared that
we're going to hurt her;

30:06.868 --> 30:08.734
you're scared that you are.

30:11.989 --> 30:13.956
Vincent?

30:13.958 --> 30:15.458
Right here.

30:15.460 --> 30:17.243
Hold your fire.

30:33.010 --> 30:34.644
The horse Whiskers is clean.

30:34.646 --> 30:36.729
No drugs were found
in his system.

30:36.731 --> 30:39.682
But the girlfriend said
Tommy was doping him.

30:39.684 --> 30:41.800
Well, the girlfriend
was mistaken or lying.

30:41.802 --> 30:43.819
Yeah, and I'm looking
into Tommy's financials--

30:43.821 --> 30:45.938
there's no money
and there's no big purchases.

30:45.940 --> 30:49.075
Not much of a gambler.
But he <i>was</i> leaving.

30:49.077 --> 30:50.610
He booked an e-ticket
to Florida.

30:50.612 --> 30:51.977
Maybe he just wanted

30:51.979 --> 30:53.946
to get away from
the girlfriend.

30:55.198 --> 30:57.750
Well, we've got a lying,
scorned girlfriend--

30:57.752 --> 31:00.836
we just need something
to tie her to the crime scene.

31:00.838 --> 31:04.957
I've got a mold of some
tire treads from the alley.

31:04.959 --> 31:07.364
Seriously, how long does it
take to much a fingerprint?

31:07.389 --> 31:08.161
We just sent it in.

31:08.162 --> 31:09.345
Call the CSI guy again.

31:09.347 --> 31:12.048
CSU. <i>CSI</i> is a TV show.

31:12.050 --> 31:14.517
(phone rings)
Hello?

31:14.519 --> 31:16.835
Hey, do you remember what kind
of car Clarissa drives?

31:16.837 --> 31:19.338
Alfa Romeo.
I'll call you later, okay?

31:22.045 --> 31:23.515
Okay. I swear,
I always thought,

31:23.615 --> 31:25.397
when she disappeared,
she was with you.

31:25.846 --> 31:27.947
I mean, what the hell
was he thinking?

31:27.949 --> 31:29.649
After everything
we've been through,

31:29.651 --> 31:32.618
after everything we've done.

31:34.488 --> 31:36.455
You ever afraid of him?

31:36.457 --> 31:38.874
What?

31:38.876 --> 31:41.077
That he's going
to hurt you or...?

31:41.079 --> 31:42.545
No.

31:42.547 --> 31:44.296
I've known him
my whole life.

31:44.298 --> 31:46.916
I mean, it freaks me out
when he's like that,

31:46.918 --> 31:49.952
but... he'd never hurt me.

31:49.954 --> 31:52.922
How do you know?

31:52.924 --> 31:55.808
I just know.

31:55.810 --> 31:58.144
(laptop chirps)

31:58.146 --> 31:59.178
We got him?

31:59.180 --> 32:01.180
Okay, just give me one second.

32:01.182 --> 32:03.232
(typing)
Having a heart attack.

32:03.234 --> 32:04.934
I'm having a heart attack
right now.

32:04.936 --> 32:06.986
Okay, we got him. Let's go.

32:06.988 --> 32:08.938
I'm still gonna have
a heart attack.

32:08.940 --> 32:11.991
VINCENT:
I'm not going in on a leash.

32:14.828 --> 32:17.713
It's just
a precaution, Vincent.

32:21.702 --> 32:23.703
We're working
on something

32:23.705 --> 32:27.123
that may be able to help you,
make you better.

32:27.125 --> 32:28.791
(vehicle approaches)

32:29.909 --> 32:31.794
Well, look who it is.

32:31.796 --> 32:34.046
She just can't stay away.

32:34.048 --> 32:35.965
My terms.

32:35.967 --> 32:39.435
Guns down. Guns down.

32:39.437 --> 32:40.919
CATHERINE:
Vincent, don't do this.

32:40.921 --> 32:43.139
You need to go now.

32:43.141 --> 32:45.024
No.
SILVERFOX: As pleasant a surprise

32:45.026 --> 32:47.643
as this is, he's already made
the decision for you,

32:47.645 --> 32:49.928
Detective.
It's not a decision, Vincent.

32:49.930 --> 32:52.565
Tommy Holt would be
dead if not for you.

32:52.567 --> 32:54.233
Come on, Vincent.

32:54.235 --> 32:55.818
Take your hands off him.

32:59.372 --> 33:01.273
(growling)

33:06.329 --> 33:07.747
(grunts)

33:10.884 --> 33:12.752
(Catherine grunting)

33:19.676 --> 33:22.344
(Vincent growls)

33:31.304 --> 33:33.022
(roars)

33:34.274 --> 33:37.309
(both grunting)

33:45.452 --> 33:47.753
(both grunting)

34:01.218 --> 34:03.102
(growls)

34:11.918 --> 34:14.503
CATHERINE: So, what happens now?
Do more of them come after us?

34:14.505 --> 34:18.257
No. His cell was the only one
who knew about you.

34:18.944 --> 34:20.659
Yeah, but the rest of Muirfield
knows about you.

34:21.411 --> 34:23.995
Right now, I'm more worried
about cleaning up this mess.

34:23.996 --> 34:26.063
Vincent, it's the middle
of the day; you should go.

34:26.065 --> 34:27.949
No, I'm not going to
leave you with this.

34:27.951 --> 34:29.868
Go back to the case,
figure out what happened

34:29.870 --> 34:31.753
to the kid, okay?

34:31.755 --> 34:34.922
I will deal
with this.

34:35.088 --> 34:35.837
Okay.

34:49.902 --> 34:51.219
TESS:
You lied, Clarissa.

34:51.221 --> 34:53.087
You told us Tommy
was doping horses.

34:53.089 --> 34:54.422
He was.
Were you just heartbroken 'cause

34:54.424 --> 34:55.739
he was leaving you
to move to Florida?

34:55.742 --> 34:57.191
What?
You just snapped?

34:57.193 --> 35:00.028
No, no, he said
he wasn't leaving me.

35:00.030 --> 35:01.762
I would never...
We tracked your E-ZPass.

35:02.256 --> 35:03.756
You drove into the city

35:03.758 --> 35:05.624
right before Tommy's body
was left for dead.

35:05.626 --> 35:07.093
Your treads match
the tire marks

35:07.095 --> 35:08.260
we found by
the Dumpster,

35:08.262 --> 35:09.845
and I'm pretty sure,

35:09.847 --> 35:11.897
when we send CSU to check
your car, we'll find

35:11.899 --> 35:12.932
evidence that
Tommy was there.

35:12.934 --> 35:15.101
He attacked her.
Who?

35:15.103 --> 35:17.069
My mother.
He was doping horses.

35:17.071 --> 35:19.822
She caught him,
and he came after her.

35:19.824 --> 35:21.857
She had to fight him off.
It was self-defense.

35:21.859 --> 35:23.192
Why didn't she just
call the police?

35:23.194 --> 35:25.310
It would hurt
the club's reputation,

35:25.312 --> 35:27.863
her program's reputation.

35:27.865 --> 35:31.117
He has a record.

35:31.119 --> 35:32.985
He has done things
like this before.

35:32.987 --> 35:35.254
That's not you talking;
that's your mom, isn't it?

35:36.322 --> 35:37.590
You know Tommy's a good person,

35:37.592 --> 35:38.858
that he's changed.

35:38.860 --> 35:40.543
Your mom made
you doubt that,

35:40.545 --> 35:43.429
made you question
what you knew was true.

35:47.217 --> 35:49.351
She needed my help moving him.

35:49.353 --> 35:50.970
TESS:  And you drove
her and Tommy

35:50.972 --> 35:52.688
into the city and helped her put

35:52.690 --> 35:54.306
his body in that Dumpster.

35:54.308 --> 35:55.441
Why would she hurt him?

35:55.443 --> 35:56.675
You said
you didn't want

35:56.677 --> 35:58.027
to tell her
about the relationship

35:58.029 --> 35:59.612
because she wouldn't approve.

35:59.614 --> 36:02.648
But she didn't even know
about me and Tommy.

36:02.650 --> 36:06.285
When did you give Tommy
your father's old watch?

36:07.988 --> 36:10.022
Last weekend.

36:10.024 --> 36:12.708
Oh, my God.

36:12.710 --> 36:14.526
She must have seen
Tommy wearing it,

36:14.528 --> 36:16.078
then figured it out.

36:26.590 --> 36:29.925
Wait a minute.
Why do you have that?

36:29.927 --> 36:31.376
Well, we're not here
for polo lessons.

36:31.378 --> 36:32.561
Your daughter told
us where to find

36:32.563 --> 36:34.647
the mallet you used on Tommy.

36:34.649 --> 36:36.932
TESS: We looked into
your financials.

36:36.934 --> 36:39.218
When your husband died,
he left you in horrible debt.

36:39.220 --> 36:41.604
You've been counting
on Clarissa marrying Sean Hyland

36:41.606 --> 36:43.239
to get you
out of it.

36:43.241 --> 36:45.157
Tommy was going to ruin
the whole thing.

36:45.159 --> 36:49.111
No, he was doping horses.

36:49.113 --> 36:50.579
CATHERINE: CSUs went through
Clarissa's car,

36:50.581 --> 36:52.915
found this.

36:52.917 --> 36:54.333
It's Tommy's cell.

36:54.335 --> 36:57.569
Must have slipped out
when you dumped the body.

36:57.571 --> 36:59.738
Texts say Tommy told you
he wasn't leaving after all,

36:59.740 --> 37:02.458
that he and Clarissa
loved each other.

37:02.460 --> 37:04.293
So you told him to meet
you in the stables,

37:04.295 --> 37:06.128
he said okay, and
that's the last text

37:06.130 --> 37:07.413
he wrote.

37:09.683 --> 37:11.600
He should have listened to me.

37:11.602 --> 37:15.638
I couldn't let my daughter
just ruin her life.

37:15.640 --> 37:16.772
Yeah, or yours.

37:16.774 --> 37:18.274
Lois Whitworth,
you're under arrest

37:18.276 --> 37:20.092
for the attempted
murder of Tommy Holt.

37:20.094 --> 37:21.610
You have the right
to remain silent.

37:21.612 --> 37:23.112
Anything you say
can and will be held

37:23.114 --> 37:24.780
against you
in a court of law.

37:24.782 --> 37:26.532
You have the right to an
attorney. If you can't

37:26.534 --> 37:28.150
afford one, you will be
provided with one.

37:28.152 --> 37:30.402
Do you understand your rights
as I have read them to you?

37:44.718 --> 37:46.669
He's doing better.

37:46.671 --> 37:48.470
He woke up.

37:48.472 --> 37:49.955
He knows who I am.

37:49.957 --> 37:51.123
I'm really glad.

37:52.225 --> 37:55.644
I want to thank you
guys for everything.

37:55.646 --> 37:58.063
I wish I could thank
the guy who found Tommy.

37:58.065 --> 38:00.482
Whoever he is,
he a hero.

38:00.484 --> 38:02.134
Yeah, he is.

It was a nice home run.

40:08.662 --> 40:11.146
This isn't a typical situation.

40:12.065 --> 40:14.033
No.

40:14.035 --> 40:16.068
I'm used to things
being black-and-white,

40:16.070 --> 40:20.489
and this is just... it's gray.

40:21.574 --> 40:23.492
The things you've done...

40:23.494 --> 40:25.561
I hate myself
for them.

40:25.563 --> 40:26.879
I know that,
and I know

40:26.881 --> 40:29.298
that you can't control it

40:29.300 --> 40:32.251
and that... and that you have
a good heart.

40:37.123 --> 40:39.508
But I'm going to have questions.

40:43.763 --> 40:45.931
Look...

40:48.351 --> 40:51.987
For the first time in
a long, long while,

40:51.989 --> 40:54.523
I've felt like new things
are possible for me,

40:54.525 --> 40:57.493
but, Catherine, the
way that you looked

40:57.495 --> 41:00.562
at me in the park
that night...

41:01.698 --> 41:04.266
...everything came
crashing back.

41:05.118 --> 41:07.319
The reality of

41:07.321 --> 41:11.623
what I am and what
I have done...

41:11.625 --> 41:15.627
and the idea that you and JT
are paying the price for it,

41:15.629 --> 41:19.615
that you are collateral
damage because of me...

41:19.617 --> 41:23.719
that is why I
gave myself in.

41:26.206 --> 41:31.276
You know, that, um... that first
night we met in the woods...

41:34.981 --> 41:39.318
...I knew
that you would never hurt me.

41:40.787 --> 41:42.955
That was my gut.

41:45.325 --> 41:47.859
I'm sticking with that.

41:51.581 --> 41:53.799
I wish this was easier.

41:54.667 --> 41:57.136
Yeah, I do, too.
