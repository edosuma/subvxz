WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:03.503
What?
You guys are doing it now?

00:03.537 --> 00:04.770
It's none of your business.

00:04.805 --> 00:06.272
It should be pretty
cut and dry.

00:06.306 --> 00:09.408
You plead guilty to unlawful
sexual conduct,

00:09.443 --> 00:12.411
the statutory rape charge
goes away.

00:16.483 --> 00:17.817
Nice work, asshole.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.152
Deal's off.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.120
No fair.
Indian givers.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.355
I'm dropping the case,

00:22.389 --> 00:24.257
leaving the opportunity
for you to find

00:24.291 --> 00:27.026
an attorney who suits your
particular personality.

00:27.060 --> 00:29.028
Look around.
Welcome to rock bottom.

00:29.062 --> 00:32.365
I live in this shitty,
filthy hotel room.

00:32.399 --> 00:33.666
You hate me.
Becca hates me.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.867
My attorney dumped me.

00:34.902 --> 00:36.802
- I'll be your attorney again.
- Really?

00:36.837 --> 00:38.037
- You will?
- Yes.

00:38.071 --> 00:39.372
No more sex.

00:39.406 --> 00:41.007
I'm Peggy,
your real estate agent.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.241
You're such a fucking slut.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.242
Ow!

00:43.277 --> 00:44.477
What the fuck?

00:44.511 --> 00:46.078
You can choke me
if you want to.

00:46.113 --> 00:48.314
So what if you knocked up
one of these slunts?

00:48.348 --> 00:49.615
I would present her
with a gift card

00:49.650 --> 00:51.984
entitling the bearer
to one back-alley abortion.

00:52.019 --> 00:53.219
I'm pregnant.

00:55.289 --> 00:56.556
Oh, God, Stu.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.391
Jesus.

00:58.425 --> 00:59.959
I'm gonna be a father!

00:59.993 --> 01:01.427
No.
Stu!

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

01:14.274 --> 01:16.876
Here's to Hank Moody...

01:16.910 --> 01:18.177
Versus the state of California.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.545
Up yours.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.047
And here's to you keeping
my black ass

01:21.081 --> 01:22.281
out of San Quentin.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.416
I'll do my utmost.

01:23.450 --> 01:26.018
And the devil
take the hindmost.

01:26.053 --> 01:27.353
Remember, when you're
up there on the stand

01:27.387 --> 01:28.688
and the prosecutor asks you...

01:28.722 --> 01:30.523
I am not a crook.

01:30.557 --> 01:31.724
That's good.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.159
I am not a crook.

01:33.193 --> 01:34.227
All right, all right.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.328
You're sick of all the prep.

01:35.362 --> 01:36.729
I understand.
I got it.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.564
I am sick of it, yes,
but I'm also nervous.

01:38.599 --> 01:39.765
- I am.
- Yeah, you should be.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.067
Yeah, I just hope
I don't get the squirts

01:41.101 --> 01:42.468
up on the stand.

01:42.502 --> 01:43.736
Well, me too.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.805
Nervous shitters are almost
always found guilty.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.073
I would imagine.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.407
How about you?

01:48.442 --> 01:51.043
- You nervous at all?
- No.

01:51.078 --> 01:52.578
I used to be.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.780
Fuck, I used to blow chunks
the night before

01:54.815 --> 01:56.115
every first day in court.

01:56.149 --> 01:57.283
No, that's hot.
Yeah.

01:57.317 --> 01:59.352
I wish I had been there
to hold your hair back

01:59.386 --> 02:00.553
and fondle your titties.

02:00.587 --> 02:03.489
Oh, how you talk.

02:03.523 --> 02:05.424
Well, but I've been doing this
a long time now.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.159
I've lost the butterflies.

02:07.194 --> 02:09.794
Yeah.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.164
Well, it's been
an interesting ride.

02:12.199 --> 02:14.567
That is one way to put it.

02:14.601 --> 02:16.235
Thanks for sticking it
out with me.

02:16.270 --> 02:20.139
You're quite welcome.

02:20.173 --> 02:22.341
Do you want to, uh...

02:22.376 --> 02:23.676
Come upstairs and have
a nightcap?

02:23.710 --> 02:25.911
I've got the swellest little
honor bar in town.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.380
That's a nice try.

02:27.414 --> 02:29.782
Oh, come on.
Can you blame a guy?

02:29.816 --> 02:31.217
It's the Friday before
the Monday

02:31.251 --> 02:34.487
I stand trial for crimes
against humanity.

02:34.521 --> 02:36.789
A man might be craving
some company.

02:36.823 --> 02:40.026
Some of your sweet,
intelligent company.

02:40.060 --> 02:42.495
Get a massage, a facial.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.997
Stop teasing me
with your dirty talk.

02:45.032 --> 02:47.667
I'll see you Monday.

02:47.701 --> 02:51.937
Bright and early with liberty
and justice for all.

02:55.542 --> 02:57.610
Hang in there.

02:57.644 --> 02:59.011
I'm good at this.

03:12.959 --> 03:14.493
How can I help you, sir?

03:14.528 --> 03:16.962
My key has failed me, m'lady.

03:16.997 --> 03:19.398
Henry James Moody.
The third.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.434
Yes, Mr. Moody.

03:21.468 --> 03:22.635
There's just the matter
of the bill.

03:22.669 --> 03:24.070
What's the matter with it?

03:24.104 --> 03:26.238
Well, it would appear
that the credit card company

03:26.273 --> 03:28.174
is not accepting your charges.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.642
Oh, well, that shit happens.

03:29.676 --> 03:31.744
Between you and me, I'm pretty
fucking solvent right now.

03:31.778 --> 03:33.412
I made a hundy large last week.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.648
- Oh, good for you, sir.
- For doing nothing, literally.

03:35.682 --> 03:37.550
A fourth-grader could have
stepped in for me.

03:37.584 --> 03:38.718
America.

03:38.752 --> 03:39.952
It's a great
fucking country, huh?

03:39.986 --> 03:41.087
Great.

03:41.121 --> 03:42.588
So can we put this on my tab

03:42.622 --> 03:43.923
or you want to give
my agent a call?

03:43.957 --> 03:45.558
You're not gonna
throw me out on my ass

03:45.592 --> 03:47.493
over some piddly little sum,
are you?

03:47.527 --> 03:48.627
Well...

03:48.662 --> 03:49.628
What are we talking about here?

03:49.663 --> 03:50.629
- What do I owe?
- Let's see.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.965
Here we go.

03:52.999 --> 03:57.236
Roughly, uh, $25,000
and some change.

03:57.270 --> 03:58.671
Well, fuck my face.

04:01.708 --> 04:09.682
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

04:59.499 --> 05:03.602
Hey...Sweetie.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.738
Don't you just love
the fresh sea air?

05:05.772 --> 05:07.106
What are you doing?

05:07.140 --> 05:09.241
Credit card snafu at the hotel.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.243
I couldn't get in touch
with Uncle Runkle

05:11.278 --> 05:13.446
and I didn't want
to wake you guys up.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.781
You couldn't find a floozy
to take you in?

05:15.816 --> 05:16.982
Hey now.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.751
What's wrong with communing
with nature,

05:18.785 --> 05:20.119
sleeping under the stars?

05:20.153 --> 05:23.489
There's bird shit
on your shoulder.

05:23.523 --> 05:25.591
Oh, look at that.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.827
Yuck.
So there is.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.829
Did you drink and drive?

05:29.863 --> 05:32.331
In that order?

05:32.365 --> 05:33.833
Come in.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.968
Uh, I don't think that's
such a good idea, Bex.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.804
- Your mom...
- She said it was okay.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.807
Well, in that case.

05:47.214 --> 05:49.148
Oh, God.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.516
I can't believe this.

05:50.550 --> 05:52.551
I can't believe I'm deflowering

05:52.586 --> 05:54.620
my own little brother.

05:54.654 --> 05:57.022
Believe it, sister Christian.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.357
Keepin' it in the family.

05:58.391 --> 05:59.458
- Oh, my.
- Taboo-style.

05:59.493 --> 06:02.528
Oh, my own brother inside me.

06:02.562 --> 06:05.397
This is so fucking wrong!

06:05.432 --> 06:08.467
So wrong, my sexy sibling.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.402
Oh, we shared a crib.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.171
So very, very wrong.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.406
Fuck me, flesh and blood!

06:14.441 --> 06:15.541
Fuck me.

06:15.575 --> 06:17.409
Mom and dad would not like this

06:17.444 --> 06:18.410
one little bit, would they?

06:18.445 --> 06:19.578
Oh, no.

06:19.613 --> 06:20.880
Mom and dad.

06:20.914 --> 06:25.084
What if they come home
early from Mammoth?

06:25.118 --> 06:26.886
Uh...

06:26.920 --> 06:28.153
Mom and dad were...

06:28.188 --> 06:30.656
Mom and dad were
killed recently

06:30.690 --> 06:32.091
in an unfortunate car crash.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.459
Oh!

06:33.493 --> 06:38.697
Oh, your virginity is mine,
brother Runkle!

06:38.732 --> 06:43.068
You getting close,
by any chance?

06:43.103 --> 06:45.771
Did you cum already?

06:45.805 --> 06:47.773
A couple minutes back, yeah.

06:47.807 --> 06:50.142
I thought I could power
through the next boner.

06:50.176 --> 06:51.343
My bad.

06:51.378 --> 06:53.846
Oh.
Hmm.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.382
I don't mind, Charlie.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.584
Easing you pleases me.

06:58.618 --> 07:01.320
Please me you do,
my fantasy sister.

07:01.354 --> 07:04.223
I want to fulfill all
of your fantasies, Charlie.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.458
I know you've got a lot of sick,
twisted stuff

07:06.493 --> 07:08.427
going on in that dome of yours

07:08.461 --> 07:10.529
and I want to make it all
come true.

07:10.564 --> 07:14.700
Good to know.

07:14.734 --> 07:17.002
Do you want to watch me have
sex with another man?

07:17.037 --> 07:19.705
Not really.

07:19.739 --> 07:21.106
Maybe.

07:24.644 --> 07:28.414
Runkle-haus.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.849
Ugh.
It's your ex.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.217
Marcy?

07:32.252 --> 07:33.485
Who the hell was that?

07:33.520 --> 07:35.187
A little busy here, Marce.

07:35.221 --> 07:37.222
What can I do you for?

07:37.257 --> 07:40.426
Stu and I would like to have
you over for dinner tonight.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.962
Well, I can't do it tonight.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.463
I got reservations at Mozza.

07:44.497 --> 07:46.699
What about sometime next week?

07:46.733 --> 07:49.201
Look, I know it's
last-minute and all,

07:49.235 --> 07:52.104
but, uh, Stu's been
after me ever since

07:52.138 --> 07:54.540
I moved in here to have
you over, so...

07:54.574 --> 07:56.408
Yeah, why?
So he can rub my nose

07:56.443 --> 07:58.477
in the opulent lifestyle
I could never give you?

07:58.511 --> 08:00.112
Hardly.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.381
Stu is all about looking
to the future.

08:02.415 --> 08:04.550
He says it's what
mature adults do.

08:04.584 --> 08:05.918
Okay, okay.
Fine.

08:05.952 --> 08:08.554
I guess I can switch
some things around.

08:13.393 --> 08:14.960
Can I bring a date?

08:14.995 --> 08:17.429
Consider yourself plus one.

08:17.464 --> 08:21.066
Gotta go.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.835
So is there any...
anything new

08:22.869 --> 08:24.169
I need to know about?

08:24.204 --> 08:25.804
Latest developments?

08:25.839 --> 08:28.474
Any news I need
to be kept abreast of?

08:30.043 --> 08:31.777
He said, "breast."

08:31.811 --> 08:33.846
He did.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.948
"Breast."

08:35.982 --> 08:40.885
Well, you know, actually, um...

08:40.919 --> 08:42.254
I could use some money.

08:42.288 --> 08:44.423
I mean, we have
a mortgage to pay.

08:44.457 --> 08:45.824
Yeah, but I don't live
here anymore.

08:45.859 --> 08:46.825
You kicked me out, remember?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.127
Excuse me?

08:48.161 --> 08:50.062
No, the check's in the mail.
Honestly.

08:50.096 --> 08:51.497
Despite the great
unpleasantness,

08:51.531 --> 08:54.299
I've been doing quite well
financially, so.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.335
That's why you got
kicked out of your hotel?

08:56.369 --> 08:57.870
That was just a credit card
snafu, honey.

08:57.904 --> 08:59.905
Turns out it's really expensive
to live in a hotel.

08:59.939 --> 09:01.340
But I'm doing fine, sweetie.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.676
Your father
is a big-time wordsmith.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.444
Great, so you can buy me a car.

09:05.478 --> 09:06.679
You don't know how to drive.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.380
Great, so you can teach me.

09:08.415 --> 09:10.182
Where is this coming from?

09:10.216 --> 09:11.617
Pearl's learning
how to drive right now.

09:11.651 --> 09:13.018
Ben's teaching her.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.620
He's gonna get her a car too.

09:14.654 --> 09:17.623
Get a load of black Jesus.

09:17.657 --> 09:19.358
Does he turn water
into whiskey too?

09:19.392 --> 09:20.359
Heal the sick?

09:20.393 --> 09:21.827
Yeah, he does, huh?

09:21.861 --> 09:23.962
Whatever.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.698
I don't know how I feel about
you behind the wheel.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.266
What do you think?

09:27.300 --> 09:28.600
Yeah, I could teach her.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.102
You're a terrible driver.

09:30.136 --> 09:31.503
- I am not.
- Yes, you are.

09:31.538 --> 09:34.339
You're like an Asian woman
with Alzheimer's.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.341
No arms or legs.

09:36.376 --> 09:37.676
Steering with your tongue.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.646
Whoops.
You just fell over.

09:40.680 --> 09:41.680
What are you gonna do now?

09:43.283 --> 09:44.550
You see that?
No, that was horrible.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.251
- We still got it...
- You are so stupid.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.386
That family chemistry.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.755
The Cosbys, the Huxtables,
the Mansons,

09:49.789 --> 09:51.023
they got nothing on us.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.758
No, no.
You stay.

09:52.792 --> 09:55.394
You were the architect
of this sumptuous feast

09:55.428 --> 09:58.630
and I will be the boy that buses
the shit out of it.

09:58.665 --> 10:01.333
Ooh, ooh.
Whoa.

10:01.367 --> 10:02.868
Don't laugh,

10:02.902 --> 10:05.337
'cause you'll just
encourage him.

10:06.506 --> 10:08.440
Hey, whoa.

10:08.475 --> 10:09.742
Okay.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.143
Yeah.

10:11.177 --> 10:12.978
I've lost feeling in my ass.

10:13.012 --> 10:15.414
All right.
Okay.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.483
Well, that's totally normal.

10:17.517 --> 10:19.084
Not really.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.552
You hear that?
Blackie's in pain.

10:20.587 --> 10:23.188
Poor Blackie's just crying.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.657
- Did I break it?
- No, no, no, no, babe.

10:25.692 --> 10:26.692
- Just throw it in neutral.
- Nuh-uh.

10:26.726 --> 10:27.960
That's it.

10:27.994 --> 10:29.094
I don't want to learn
to drive anymore.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.162
It's too hard.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.263
Honey, you might want
to reconsider.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.331
L.A. is not known
for the quality

10:32.365 --> 10:33.565
of its public transportation.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.400
There is nothing wrong
with the big blue bus.

10:35.435 --> 10:36.835
What?

10:36.870 --> 10:38.537
You want her sandwiched between
some guy with teardrop tattoos

10:38.571 --> 10:40.839
and an old lady that smells like
cat food and menstrual blood?

10:40.874 --> 10:43.075
Why would an old woman smell
like menstrual blood?

10:43.109 --> 10:44.409
Well...

10:44.444 --> 10:46.278
Because he never thinks
before he opens his mouth.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.147
That may be true,

10:48.181 --> 10:49.882
but crazy people
do ride the bus

10:49.916 --> 10:52.217
and maybe she smells
of menstrual blood

10:52.252 --> 10:54.486
because the homeless prostitute
two seats away from her

10:54.521 --> 10:55.754
just threw her tampon at her.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.389
- Oh, my God.
- Ever think of that?

10:57.423 --> 10:58.757
- Yeah.
- I think I'm going to throw up.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.959
Do it all over his car.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.628
Come on, ladies.
Where's the love?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.096
We got to try to find it.

11:04.130 --> 11:05.931
This way, we're never gonna
make it to parallel parking.

11:05.965 --> 11:07.966
Okay, now throw it in neutral.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.034
Come on, step on the clutch.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.235
Left. Left!

11:12.105 --> 11:13.071
Why would you cross over?

11:13.106 --> 11:14.873
It's the left foot.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.942
Right foot... that's it.
Keep it on the gas.

11:16.976 --> 11:18.076
No, not on it.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.878
Now, just keep hovering.

Thank you.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.145
- Hey.
- Hey, welcome.

11:53.179 --> 11:55.280
- Hi.
- Stu.

11:55.315 --> 11:58.116
Thank you, Charlie.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.885
Okay.
Yes.

11:59.919 --> 12:01.653
This is Peggy and, Peggy,

12:01.688 --> 12:02.955
you remember Marcy?

12:02.989 --> 12:04.022
Hi, Peggy.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.992
Peggy...Our real estate agent.

12:07.026 --> 12:09.194
It's not what you think, Marcy.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.929
We're really more
like brother and sister.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.431
Okay.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.900
This place is
absolutely amazing.

12:14.934 --> 12:17.569
Let me guess.
1956?

12:17.604 --> 12:19.238
Oh, close.
'57.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.606
I'd love a tour.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.040
Oh, be a pleasure.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.642
Like the gal, Runkle.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.844
Seems like a keeper.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.513
Over here.

12:28.548 --> 12:29.915
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

12:31.351 --> 12:34.586
You're dating our realtor?

12:34.621 --> 12:36.121
If by dating,
you mean entering her

12:36.155 --> 12:37.489
on a semi-regular basis,
then, yes.

12:37.523 --> 12:38.824
Delightful.

12:38.858 --> 12:41.960
I'm so glad to hear
the slut parade continues.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.061
What?
I don't deserve a little

12:43.096 --> 12:44.129
post-divorce happiness?

12:44.163 --> 12:45.631
Excuse me.

12:45.665 --> 12:47.099
We can't all have
a rich boyfriend

12:47.133 --> 12:48.267
with a legendary schlong.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.269
Is it serious?

12:50.303 --> 12:51.303
With Peggy?

12:51.337 --> 12:52.638
Who knows?

12:52.672 --> 12:54.139
I'm taking it day by day.

12:54.173 --> 12:55.874
Wouldn't want to rush
into anything.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.542
I likes me my freedom.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.111
Was that a jab at me?

12:59.145 --> 13:00.979
A little one.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.247
I mean, this whole business
with Stu

13:02.282 --> 13:04.049
sort of came out of nowhere,
don't you think?

13:04.083 --> 13:05.684
I don't know what you
to tell you, Charlie.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.252
The heart wants.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.154
Well, this heart wants freedom
from responsibility

13:09.188 --> 13:10.656
and an abundance of strange.

13:10.690 --> 13:14.593
That's where I'm at.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.429
Okay, I'll be getting out
of your hair.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.830
That's okay.

13:18.865 --> 13:21.500
You could stay the weekend.
It's good for Becca.

13:21.534 --> 13:22.968
- You sure?
- Yeah.

13:23.002 --> 13:24.536
I mean, that way we get
to make sure

13:24.570 --> 13:26.004
that you go to court on Monday.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.040
You see that?
You're always thinking about me.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.841
- Mm-hmm.
- Much appreesh.

13:29.876 --> 13:31.643
Why don't I make you
some dinner?

13:31.678 --> 13:33.312
Well, there's an empty offer.
You can't cook.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.713
Excuse me?

13:34.747 --> 13:36.481
What do you call
cheese sensation?

13:36.516 --> 13:39.318
A coronary in a casserole dish.

13:39.352 --> 13:40.485
All right, then you go ahead
and make something

13:40.520 --> 13:42.754
all organic and healthy
and vegetarian and shit,

13:42.789 --> 13:44.589
and I'll pick out a movie
for us to watch.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.658
I'm going out.

13:46.693 --> 13:47.826
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

13:47.860 --> 13:49.962
- Out out?
- I guess.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.330
Like out-on-a-date out?

13:51.364 --> 13:53.265
Um, dinner out.

13:53.299 --> 13:54.666
Cool Hand Ben?

13:54.701 --> 13:57.703
With Ben, yes,
and if you're gonna give me shit

13:57.737 --> 13:59.104
about it,
you can leave right now.

13:59.138 --> 14:00.138
No, I won't.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.140
I have grown a lot
since breakfast.

14:02.175 --> 14:06.511
So are you guys, like,
officially dating now?

14:06.546 --> 14:08.847
We're not officially anything
except friends.

14:08.881 --> 14:11.650
Friends who go out
to dinner on a Saturday night

14:11.684 --> 14:13.218
and you're all gussied up.

14:13.252 --> 14:15.554
But that doesn't quite
do it justice,

14:15.588 --> 14:16.922
'cause you look beautiful.

14:16.956 --> 14:18.156
He's a lucky guy.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.391
Thank you.

14:19.425 --> 14:21.994
I wish I were him.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.929
And not just because I always
wanted to be black...

14:25.431 --> 14:27.265
Or it'd be a nice escape
from being me,

14:27.300 --> 14:30.736
which is getting pretty old
right about now,

14:30.770 --> 14:33.271
but because it reminds me
of when we first started dating

14:33.306 --> 14:35.807
and I would knock
on your door and

14:35.842 --> 14:38.176
in the time between
you answering,

14:38.211 --> 14:40.679
I would try to imagine what you
were gonna look like.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.681
And when you did,
you'd be, like,

14:42.715 --> 14:44.549
ten times more beautiful
than I could ever imagine.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.051
Stop it.

14:46.085 --> 14:47.853
And I'd get this funny
feeling in my stomach

14:47.887 --> 14:50.722
because you'd look at me with
all this hope in your eyes

14:50.757 --> 14:55.894
instead of disappointment,
which is what I see now.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.268
Yeah, like I said.

15:03.302 --> 15:05.871
Lucky guy.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.172
What's up?

15:07.206 --> 15:08.640
Benjamin.

15:08.674 --> 15:11.109
- Henry.
- Nice.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.144
Pearl, respect.

15:12.178 --> 15:13.178
Papa Moody.

15:13.212 --> 15:16.581
Yeah, that still queers me out.

15:16.616 --> 15:20.085
So, um, we shouldn't be,
you know, late.

15:20.119 --> 15:22.187
Go have fun, you kids.

15:22.221 --> 15:23.722
I'll keep an eye
on these rapscallions.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.058
Maybe they'd be safer keeping
an eye on themselves.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.593
All right, well, then they
can keep an eye on me.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.695
Hey, you ladies want
to do anything?

15:30.730 --> 15:34.399
Who's up for a game
of hypodermic needle darts?

15:34.434 --> 15:38.737
I said hypodermic needle darts
for the children.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.872
Go on, ladies.

15:40.907 --> 15:42.274
Dig in.

15:42.308 --> 15:43.742
This stuff will clog
your arteries,

15:43.776 --> 15:45.644
but it'll also put hair
on your chest.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.479
You'll thank me later.

15:47.513 --> 15:49.614
Kind of looks like an autopsy.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.117
Yes, but it tastes
like America.

15:52.151 --> 15:54.219
So what do you freaks
want to do?

15:54.253 --> 15:55.921
Do you want to catch
a movie or something?

15:55.955 --> 15:57.656
You want to get your
<i>High School Musical</i> on?

15:57.690 --> 15:58.957
Those movies are awful, dad.

15:58.991 --> 16:00.225
Yeah, thanks for trying,

16:00.259 --> 16:02.327
but that's not really
what the kids are into.

16:02.361 --> 16:03.562
Tell me what the kids are into.

16:03.596 --> 16:06.665
Take me to school, ladies.

16:06.699 --> 16:07.933
Pretty much getting fucked up

16:07.967 --> 16:09.167
and searching the net
for stupid shit.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.836
That sound pretty good.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.637
That sounds like
the modern equivalent

16:12.672 --> 16:14.473
of hanging out in front
of the 7-Eleven

16:14.507 --> 16:15.707
and waiting for something
to happen,

16:15.741 --> 16:16.942
which I did the shit
out of in my youth,

16:16.976 --> 16:20.011
but I can't endorse
in you youngsters.

16:20.046 --> 16:23.348
How about some, uh...
Ooh, <i>American Idol?</i>

16:23.382 --> 16:24.916
- Dad...
- What?

16:24.951 --> 16:26.451
Do we look like
the kind of girls

16:26.486 --> 16:27.819
who are into <i>American Idol?</i>

16:27.854 --> 16:29.654
No, not so much.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.756
Actually, you look like girls
who would hurt girls

16:31.791 --> 16:33.024
who are into <i>American Idol.</i>

16:33.059 --> 16:34.960
Aww, he gets us.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.662
Actually, we were just gonna
hang out and write a song.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.365
Wow.
That sounds totally cool.

16:40.399 --> 16:42.000
- Can I watch?
- No.

16:42.034 --> 16:43.168
Yeah, that's not cool.

16:43.202 --> 16:44.970
You can't write
in front of an audience.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.438
Oh.

16:46.472 --> 16:48.373
We'll play it for you
when we're done.

16:48.407 --> 16:51.209
Excellent.
That's a deal.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.116
This is not my best batch.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.684
Yeah, it kind of tastes
like ass.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.521
Not the good kind either.

17:25.478 --> 17:26.678
Come on.
Let's go.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.480
And that, my friends,

17:28.513 --> 17:30.582
is the real reason
<i>Midnight Cowboy</i>

17:30.616 --> 17:32.050
was given an "X" rating.

17:32.084 --> 17:33.752
Fascinating stuff, Stu.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.086
You should really write a book.

17:35.121 --> 17:36.488
I could sell that shit
in a heartbeat.

17:36.522 --> 17:38.023
No, no.
Enough about me.

17:38.057 --> 17:41.393
I believe my dear Marcy
has something

17:41.427 --> 17:42.494
she would like to share.

17:42.528 --> 17:43.728
Oh, no.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.497
Tell 'em the one
about Marisa Tomei

17:45.531 --> 17:48.667
and what she really did
to get that Oscar.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.302
No, no, no, no, no.
Enough about the past.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.804
Let's talk about the future.

17:52.838 --> 17:55.173
This is a night
to celebrate beginnings.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.642
Don't you think, Marcy?

17:57.677 --> 17:58.977
Beginnings?

17:59.011 --> 18:01.012
Would anybody like more wine?

18:01.047 --> 18:02.047
No, no.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.081
No.

18:03.115 --> 18:05.083
Okay.

18:09.922 --> 18:10.989
Ahem.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.924
Life is a fucked up thing.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.927
Shit happens.

18:15.962 --> 18:19.598
One day you're up
and another you're down.

18:19.632 --> 18:20.832
- Marcy? Marcy?
- What?

18:20.866 --> 18:22.200
- The wine.
- What?

18:22.235 --> 18:23.501
- Wine.
- Hmm?

18:23.536 --> 18:25.170
The baby!

18:25.204 --> 18:27.272
Jesus!

18:31.444 --> 18:33.979
What are you looking at?

18:34.013 --> 18:35.680
Apparently, I'm looking
at a pregnant woman.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.449
I'm so sorry, Marcy.

18:37.483 --> 18:40.185
No, it's fine.
Okay, so now you know.

18:40.219 --> 18:42.454
Stu done knocked me up.

18:42.488 --> 18:43.822
I am indeed with child.

18:43.856 --> 18:44.823
Shout it from the rooftops.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.291
Are you keeping it?

18:46.325 --> 18:48.460
What the fuck
kind of question is that?

18:48.494 --> 18:49.494
What?

18:49.528 --> 18:50.795
Of course we're keeping it.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.163
The Beggs' name will live on

18:52.198 --> 18:55.533
thanks to the welcoming confines
of Marcy's blessed womb.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.469
How is this even possible?

18:57.503 --> 18:59.771
Charlie, we wanted
to let you know

18:59.805 --> 19:01.072
before you found out
somewhere else.

19:01.107 --> 19:02.574
It just seemed like
the right thing to do.

19:02.608 --> 19:04.009
Well, that was quick.

19:04.043 --> 19:05.710
Who knew you were such
a fertile myrtle, Marce?

19:05.745 --> 19:07.746
You don't seem exactly happy
for us, Charlie.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.848
Me?
I'm ecstatic.

19:09.882 --> 19:12.617
Why shouldn't I be happy
that my ex-wife

19:12.652 --> 19:14.152
and her new boyfriend
of six weeks

19:14.186 --> 19:15.320
are expecting a child?

19:15.354 --> 19:20.659
Mazel-fucking-tov.
Really.

19:30.803 --> 19:33.905
Hey, Becca, will you get that?

19:33.939 --> 19:35.907
Becca?

19:40.980 --> 19:43.782
Hello?

19:48.421 --> 19:51.990
Becca?
Becca?

19:52.024 --> 19:54.025
Becca.

20:01.467 --> 20:04.135
You okay, Pearl?

20:04.170 --> 20:05.637
Pearl!

20:05.671 --> 20:09.474
Pearl.

20:09.508 --> 20:11.343
- You okay?
- Baby.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.744
You're okay?
You sure?

20:16.549 --> 20:17.782
What the fuck happened?

20:17.817 --> 20:20.251
They took my keys
and snuck out.

20:20.286 --> 20:21.586
I thought you were keeping
an eye on them.

20:21.620 --> 20:22.821
I dozed.

20:22.855 --> 20:23.955
Which has nothing
to do with the booze

20:23.989 --> 20:25.757
on your breath, right?

20:25.791 --> 20:28.326
Well, I detect a faint hint
of cock on your breath,

20:28.361 --> 20:30.628
but I'm not giving you a hard
time about it, am I?

20:30.663 --> 20:32.731
It was our fault, okay?
It was our fault.

20:32.765 --> 20:35.066
We would have tried the same
thing if my mom was there.

20:35.101 --> 20:37.068
It's true.
They would have.

20:37.103 --> 20:39.070
You defending him now too?

20:39.105 --> 20:41.005
I'm not defending anyone.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.741
I'm just glad they're alive.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.976
Let's go, Pearl.

20:45.010 --> 20:47.946
We're gonna go home.

20:51.984 --> 20:52.984
Hey, at least
I don't have to worry

20:53.018 --> 20:54.986
about fixing
that headlight anymore.

20:55.020 --> 20:58.890
Did I do something wrong?

21:01.560 --> 21:03.561
Okay.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.404
You still have feelings
for her, don't you?

21:12.438 --> 21:14.806
That's what you're mad about?

21:14.840 --> 21:16.241
I saw the way you looked at her

21:16.275 --> 21:18.309
when you found out
she was pregnant.

21:18.344 --> 21:19.511
Look?
There was no look.

21:19.545 --> 21:22.747
I was... I was taken aback,
that's all.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.650
I can't fuck a man who's
in love with another, Charlie.

21:25.684 --> 21:27.185
I can't do it.

21:27.219 --> 21:28.753
I won't do it.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.456
Peggy, Marcy and I have a long,

21:31.490 --> 21:33.024
complicated history together.

21:33.058 --> 21:37.862
I can't just turn off my
emotions like flipping a switch.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.063
Do you want a child, Charlie?

21:39.098 --> 21:40.432
Is that what this is about?

21:40.466 --> 21:42.167
No!

21:42.201 --> 21:44.836
Maybe.
I... I don't know.

21:44.870 --> 21:49.307
You disgust me right now,
Charlie.

21:49.341 --> 21:50.308
Are you barren?

21:50.342 --> 21:53.244
I most certainly am not.

21:53.279 --> 21:55.513
Look, Peggy...

21:55.548 --> 21:57.982
I don't know what's
gonna be with you and me,

21:58.017 --> 22:01.152
but Marcy will always
have a place in my heart.

22:01.187 --> 22:03.755
If you can't deal with that,
then I don't know

22:03.789 --> 22:07.659
if this thing between us
can work out.

22:10.396 --> 22:12.597
Oh, Charlie!
Oh, Char... Charlie!

22:12.631 --> 22:14.199
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh, Charlie, I'm sorry.

22:14.233 --> 22:15.567
- I didn't mean to, really.
- Ah!

22:15.601 --> 22:17.769
I didn't mean to.
I'm so sorry.

22:17.803 --> 22:19.838
What the fuck, Peggy?

22:19.872 --> 22:22.006
I know what will
make it better.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.509
Let me make it nice.

22:24.543 --> 22:28.880
You let Peggy make
the pain go bye-bye.

22:28.914 --> 22:31.649
Oh, God.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.351
Oh, God.

22:33.385 --> 22:34.619
Oh.
Oh.

22:34.653 --> 22:37.088
- Oh, God.
- Mmm.

22:40.593 --> 22:43.127
You forget your desserts.

22:43.162 --> 22:46.431
I put perfect.

22:46.465 --> 22:49.300
Thank you, Irma.

22:49.335 --> 22:50.835
Mmm.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.270
Oh, God.

22:52.304 --> 22:54.639
Oh, God.

22:54.673 --> 22:56.908
I'm warning you,

22:56.942 --> 23:00.044
tomorrow, I'm gonna
be pretty pissed at you.

23:00.079 --> 23:02.914
But, tonight, I'm just
high-fiving Jesus

23:02.948 --> 23:04.549
that you're okay.

23:04.583 --> 23:06.351
I'm sorry about the car.

23:06.385 --> 23:07.519
It's just a car.

23:07.553 --> 23:08.720
You love that car.

23:08.754 --> 23:11.122
No, I love you.

23:11.156 --> 23:13.491
I love you too and I'm scared.

23:13.526 --> 23:15.260
Why?

23:15.294 --> 23:16.594
I don't want you to be guilty.

23:16.629 --> 23:19.330
I don't want people
to look at you that way.

23:19.365 --> 23:24.302
I want them to know
how great you can be.

23:24.336 --> 23:26.037
You shouldn't
be thinking about that.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.039
That's too much for your brain.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.774
All you should be thinking
about is boys

23:29.808 --> 23:32.510
and rock and roll and stealing
your old man's car keys.

23:32.545 --> 23:36.514
But not anymore, 'cause I'll
chop your hands off, okay?

23:36.549 --> 23:38.583
It was a nice day, wasn't it?

23:38.617 --> 23:41.252
It was.
It was really nice.

23:41.287 --> 23:42.687
It was a perfect day.

23:42.721 --> 23:44.989
Right up until I ruined it.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.258
You didn't ruin anything.

23:47.293 --> 23:50.228
You just made a mistake,
a really terrible mistake.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.397
But we all do.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.464
Look at me.

23:53.499 --> 23:56.100
I take a breath,
I make a mistake.

23:56.135 --> 24:01.472
Then we just get up and shoot
for another perfect day.

24:05.044 --> 24:09.013
I'm going to be thinking good
thoughts, dad, on Monday.

24:13.619 --> 24:16.588
Thank you.

24:32.638 --> 24:35.340
How the fuck did we get here?

24:35.374 --> 24:38.176
I don't know, but I'm pretty
sure it's your fault.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.944
Oh, undoubtedly.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.880
I am currently accepting blame
for everything.

24:42.915 --> 24:46.250
Volcanoes, earthquakes,
oil spills...

24:46.285 --> 24:49.821
Steroids, rap music.

24:49.855 --> 24:51.155
It's all my fault.

24:51.190 --> 24:53.758
You tricked me, you know?

24:53.792 --> 24:57.228
You tricked me.

24:57.262 --> 24:59.364
I would hear the doorbell ring
and I would go

24:59.398 --> 25:03.167
running towards it and...

25:03.202 --> 25:05.770
I'd be thinking, "I don't
even like this guy.

25:05.804 --> 25:08.239
This is just some
stupid fling."

25:08.273 --> 25:12.477
And then I'd open the door and
all those thoughts

25:12.511 --> 25:16.214
disappeared because...

25:16.248 --> 25:19.050
I'd see your smile
and I was a goner.

25:22.454 --> 25:24.722
I trusted that smile.

25:24.757 --> 25:28.526
He was a good guy, that smile.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.995
I don't see him much
around anymore.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.131
I miss him.

25:33.165 --> 25:34.632
It's so strange.

25:34.667 --> 25:38.002
Just changed so fast.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.537
Once, you were my future.

25:39.571 --> 25:43.141
Then you were my...misery.

25:43.175 --> 25:44.542
Hmm. Nice.

25:44.576 --> 25:46.444
And now you're almost my past.

25:46.478 --> 25:49.614
Almost.

25:49.648 --> 25:51.149
Well, I'm trying.

25:51.183 --> 25:52.383
Well, that's impossible.

25:52.418 --> 25:56.087
I'll always be buzzing
around like a gnat.

25:56.121 --> 26:02.060
Like a well-hung gnat...
With a dream.

26:02.094 --> 26:05.396
You know what I mean.

26:05.431 --> 26:07.699
Yeah.

26:07.733 --> 26:10.735
I think I do know what you mean

26:10.769 --> 26:14.105
and I kind of hate that I do.

26:14.139 --> 26:15.907
Are you ready for Monday?

26:15.941 --> 26:17.341
I don't want
to think about Monday.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.477
I just want
to think about today.

26:19.511 --> 26:21.446
Well, today's gone.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.548
It's tomorrow already.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.718
In a couple hours,
we'll get up.

26:26.752 --> 26:30.154
We'll drink some coffee,
read the paper,

26:30.189 --> 26:34.192
laugh at all your jokes...

26:34.226 --> 26:37.095
And try to forget that
the next day isn't Monday.

26:37.129 --> 26:38.763
And then Monday will come

26:38.797 --> 26:44.368
and we'll take Becca to school.

26:44.403 --> 26:48.039
Then I'll take you to court...

26:48.073 --> 26:49.407
So that you can stand trial

26:49.441 --> 26:54.245
for raping a teenage girl.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.581
Because that is the reality
of our lives right now.

27:00.886 --> 27:04.856
I don't know how we got here...

27:07.559 --> 27:10.595
But this is where we are.
