WEBVTT

02:09.547 --> 02:13.468
Shit, you're so fucking dumb, Zap.
I got the keys!

02:15.970 --> 02:17.305
I... I zapped it.

02:17.722 --> 02:21.601
Zapped it. That's all you ever do, huh?
Zap things.

02:22.936 --> 02:24.729
You're real dumb, huh?

02:25.605 --> 02:27.232
This is my place.

02:27.398 --> 02:31.778
Great. You show us round
and we lose no time, okay?

02:34.405 --> 02:35.532
I need it.

02:38.535 --> 02:40.286
You'll get it, baby.

02:44.457 --> 02:47.043
Get a move on. I'll start without you.

02:52.924 --> 02:56.135
This'll stop them messing us about.

03:00.598 --> 03:01.891
I need it.

03:03.268 --> 03:05.270
It's coming! Just cool it!

03:05.937 --> 03:09.983
Get a move on, Coyotte. For Christ's sake!

03:16.948 --> 03:17.949
Fuck it!

03:25.123 --> 03:26.165
Fuck it!

03:31.129 --> 03:32.255
The light!

03:32.338 --> 03:33.965
Are you guys nuts?

03:36.134 --> 03:38.136
What are you shits after,

03:38.636 --> 03:40.096
apart from trouble?

03:44.517 --> 03:47.145
Is that your old man, Coyotte?

03:51.399 --> 03:52.650
Antoine?

03:55.278 --> 03:56.321
Dad.

04:00.158 --> 04:01.242
It's not you?

04:05.413 --> 04:06.664
We need a fix.

04:10.335 --> 04:12.420
Going to shoot your baby boy?

04:18.301 --> 04:19.510
Asshole!

04:36.110 --> 04:37.195
Asshole! Kill him!

05:03.054 --> 05:07.517
Is that it? Come on!
My name's Rico. My name's Rico!

05:07.684 --> 05:09.060
Go for it, Zap, go for it!

05:28.162 --> 05:32.041
Make it good, Zap. Make it good, huh?

05:32.834 --> 05:35.169
It's gonna be good, Rico!

05:47.265 --> 05:48.891
It's gonna be good!

06:58.461 --> 06:59.837
None left?

07:01.089 --> 07:02.215
No.

07:30.993 --> 07:32.036
Can it!

07:33.496 --> 07:34.580
Quiet!

07:39.877 --> 07:41.921
Out! Hands behind your back!

07:42.547 --> 07:44.507
Put your legs apart. More!

08:19.125 --> 08:20.376
Full name.

08:24.672 --> 08:25.965
Nikita.

08:28.926 --> 08:31.345
Here's a word of advice, cutie.

08:31.971 --> 08:36.517
Just play it cool.
I don't think this bullshit's funny.

08:37.810 --> 08:39.145
Understand?

08:39.937 --> 08:41.355
Cutie!

08:51.991 --> 08:53.784
Maybe we should wait...

08:53.868 --> 08:56.996
Cool it. I know what these jerks are like.

08:57.496 --> 08:58.956
It's all for show.

08:59.665 --> 09:00.791
Pencil.

09:05.713 --> 09:09.467
Concentrate. Put your last and first name.

09:10.968 --> 09:13.679
My name's Cutie!

09:57.515 --> 10:02.061
After considering the Saint-Denis case,
we find the accused guilty

10:02.228 --> 10:05.022
of the willful murders of Georges Henri,

10:05.189 --> 10:07.483
Grégoire Andersen and Michel Terlin,

10:07.858 --> 10:10.528
all three law-enforcement officers.

10:11.028 --> 10:15.074
In reply to the question
of extenuating circumstances,

10:15.241 --> 10:18.035
the jury has replied in the negative.

10:18.744 --> 10:23.874
Therefore, the accused is sentenced
according to Article 304

10:24.041 --> 10:27.044
to life imprisonment.

10:27.211 --> 10:30.923
With a 30-year minimum
before review for parole.

10:33.384 --> 10:34.552
Court adjourned.

10:51.235 --> 10:52.611
Motherfuckers!

10:54.363 --> 10:56.782
Motherfuckers!

10:57.074 --> 10:59.201
Let go, you asshole!

10:59.785 --> 11:00.953
Cut it out.

11:01.078 --> 11:02.371
Let me go,

11:03.414 --> 11:04.457
motherfucker!

11:08.044 --> 11:09.044
Hold her!

11:09.086 --> 11:11.422
Motherfuckers!

11:13.341 --> 11:14.717
Out of the way!

11:15.259 --> 11:16.427
Out of the way!

12:11.482 --> 12:13.484
You can't do this.

12:16.278 --> 12:18.572
I don't wanna go like this.

12:22.535 --> 12:24.370
You gotta tell my mother.

12:25.788 --> 12:27.123
She's been told.

12:31.877 --> 12:34.672
So why ain't she here?

12:37.091 --> 12:39.844
Why ain't my mother here?

12:43.639 --> 12:46.308
Can't we wait a bit longer?

12:47.852 --> 12:52.273
She'll come and fetch me.
My mother will come and fetch me.

12:58.154 --> 12:59.572
Mom.

13:05.703 --> 13:07.371
Mom.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.045
Hello.

15:21.171 --> 15:22.506
What's your name?

15:25.259 --> 15:26.427
Nikita.

15:30.556 --> 15:31.682
Nice name.

15:32.224 --> 15:33.434
Where's it from?

15:35.769 --> 15:36.937
A song.

15:37.354 --> 15:38.689
What's it about?

15:48.949 --> 15:50.034
Mister,

15:50.701 --> 15:53.746
is this Heaven here or not?

15:57.625 --> 15:58.876
No, but

16:00.544 --> 16:02.129
it could turn out to be.

16:05.257 --> 16:07.384
You died Saturday at 5:00 p.m.

16:08.052 --> 16:10.554
The prison doctor confirmed

16:10.721 --> 16:14.933
suicide after an overdose of tranquillizers.
You're buried

16:15.100 --> 16:18.145
in Maisons-Alfort, row 8, plot 30.

16:23.275 --> 16:25.319
Titi... That's Titi!

16:31.742 --> 16:32.993
I work, let's say,

16:34.036 --> 16:35.621
for the government.

16:38.290 --> 16:41.293
We've decided to give you another chance.

16:49.426 --> 16:50.511
What do I do?

16:51.011 --> 16:52.096
Learn.

16:52.596 --> 16:56.308
Learn to read, walk, talk, smile,
and even fight.

16:56.767 --> 16:58.352
Learn to do everything.

16:59.937 --> 17:01.063
What for?

17:01.522 --> 17:03.190
To serve your country.

17:06.610 --> 17:08.404
What if I don't want to?

17:12.616 --> 17:14.785
Row 8, plot 30.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.336
Can I sleep a bit before I decide?

17:32.219 --> 17:33.804
I'll be back in an hour.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.344
Motherfucker!

18:24.188 --> 18:25.439
Where's the way out?

18:25.606 --> 18:26.774
Straight ahead.

18:32.029 --> 18:34.072
- Who're these shits?
- Employees.

18:36.533 --> 18:38.368
Nobody move! It's okay!

18:38.535 --> 18:40.871
The hell it is! Nothing's okay!

18:50.255 --> 18:51.423
Open the door!

18:51.590 --> 18:52.966
I can't open it.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.889
Tell them to open the door!

19:00.390 --> 19:01.433
They won't.

19:03.894 --> 19:06.063
I'll blow your brains out.

19:06.230 --> 19:07.815
It's not loaded.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.067
Forget it. Get off me!

19:17.491 --> 19:18.575
Cool it.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.792
Right, get back to your desks.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.855
Rule 1, the first bullet's not for you.

19:51.483 --> 19:53.443
That'll clip your wings.

20:32.983 --> 20:34.484
Made your mind up?

20:40.824 --> 20:41.825
That's good.

20:51.251 --> 20:52.502
Fill that out.

20:58.717 --> 21:00.010
If I don't make it?

21:04.014 --> 21:05.390
You'll make it.

21:12.689 --> 21:15.192
We'll start with an easy program.

21:15.359 --> 21:18.904
It's like a typewriter keyboard:
letters and figures.

21:19.529 --> 21:24.409
That's the mouse.
There's a roller under it to move the arrow.

21:24.576 --> 21:27.955
If you press here, you can make drawings.

21:29.706 --> 21:30.707
Go on, then.

21:32.167 --> 21:36.213
There. Gently. That's good. Gently. Gently!

21:36.880 --> 21:40.217
Bring the arrow back now.
Back up to the corner.

21:40.384 --> 21:42.511
Bring the arrow back here.

21:44.388 --> 21:46.264
Very good. Now press here.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.768
There you go.

21:50.769 --> 21:51.895
Again.

21:58.902 --> 22:03.532
These are the firearms we use.
First, the simplest of all,

22:03.699 --> 22:08.745
the Beretta 93R, 9mm automatic,
20 shots maximum.

22:11.039 --> 22:13.458
The barrel towards the target.

22:15.377 --> 22:19.673
Before learning the correct stance,
get to know the tool.

22:19.756 --> 22:20.966
Target at 10 meters.

22:43.905 --> 22:45.449
Used one before?

22:45.949 --> 22:47.826
Never on paper.

23:08.597 --> 23:09.806
Nice and round.

23:16.646 --> 23:17.898
Can't. My leg hurts.

23:18.315 --> 23:21.485
Never mind. We'll try a reflex exercise.

23:22.819 --> 23:23.904
An easy one.

23:37.334 --> 23:38.585
Get ready.

23:46.176 --> 23:48.678
Now I've taken up my guard.

23:49.262 --> 23:52.474
I want you to try to hit my face.

24:07.531 --> 24:08.698
Next class.

25:31.448 --> 25:32.490
Sit down there.

25:51.343 --> 25:52.385
My dear girl,

25:52.469 --> 25:55.639
you don't look like much now.
Chewing gum.

25:57.265 --> 26:02.020
But if we work hard together
and if fortune smiles on us,

26:02.771 --> 26:06.024
we'll be able to make you
into a human being.

26:06.399 --> 26:09.653
An intermediary but necessary step

26:09.819 --> 26:13.156
before becoming man's perfect complement:

26:13.573 --> 26:14.824
a woman.

26:28.546 --> 26:29.923
Do you like it?

26:35.804 --> 26:38.556
Can you give me a definition of grace?

26:40.934 --> 26:41.977
I'm not smart.

26:42.477 --> 26:45.230
Smile then. That'll be a good start.

26:45.480 --> 26:47.941
Smile when you don't know something.

26:48.108 --> 26:52.112
You won't be any smarter,
but it's nice for others.

26:54.906 --> 26:59.119
Allow yourself to be taken over
by the faint fragility

26:59.411 --> 27:02.289
which will make your face beautiful.

27:02.664 --> 27:04.541
A smile.

27:08.545 --> 27:10.255
A smile

27:11.423 --> 27:14.551
is surface sweetness.

27:16.052 --> 27:18.013
Gentleness.

27:20.348 --> 27:22.350
Almost a mood.

27:52.339 --> 27:54.466
Shall we fix the wig?

28:15.737 --> 28:17.447
How's it going?

28:17.739 --> 28:19.282
I wish it had gone.

28:20.367 --> 28:22.994
A sense of humor. That's a good start.

28:30.210 --> 28:31.336
Made friends?

28:32.295 --> 28:34.339
I get on well with my mouse.

28:41.179 --> 28:43.056
When do we go for a drink?

28:45.225 --> 28:46.393
Not just yet.

28:48.353 --> 28:50.063
No rest in this factory?

28:50.230 --> 28:51.314
Never.

28:52.190 --> 28:53.691
That suits you.

28:59.697 --> 29:01.908
I'm going to be 20 next week.

29:04.786 --> 29:07.539
Can't I have just a bit of leave,

29:09.541 --> 29:10.875
if you trail me?

29:53.835 --> 29:57.839
How's it going?
I've a great program to try out.

30:02.886 --> 30:04.012
Present.

30:09.392 --> 30:10.894
Let's open it, huh?

31:35.186 --> 31:37.355
In three months,
she's screwed everything up.

31:38.147 --> 31:39.232
Lost your touch?

31:40.024 --> 31:41.526
She has potential.

31:41.901 --> 31:43.319
Potential?

31:43.653 --> 31:47.865
I wonder what for,
apart from kicking and biting instructors?

31:48.074 --> 31:50.243
Good agents take time to train:

31:51.327 --> 31:53.204
five, six years maybe.

31:53.371 --> 31:54.497
Oh, come on.

31:55.540 --> 31:59.252
I'll give you two weeks. After that, she's out.

32:09.971 --> 32:12.348
<i>- Who are you?
- I don't know.</i>

32:14.142 --> 32:16.894
<i>- But you are...
- Yes...</i>

32:18.062 --> 32:20.064
<i>What are you doing in my arms?</i>

32:20.231 --> 32:21.441
<i>I don't know.</i>

32:22.692 --> 32:24.736
<i>But now that we've gotten this far...</i>

32:27.655 --> 32:29.782
<i>Maybe it's just a dream.</i>

32:34.037 --> 32:35.580
<i>Oh, my darling.</i>

32:40.460 --> 32:44.297
You've made progress, especially in dance.

32:45.840 --> 32:47.175
In art, too.

32:49.010 --> 32:51.262
But in all the other subjects,

32:55.224 --> 32:56.976
nix, zilch,

32:57.894 --> 32:58.895
zero.

33:03.232 --> 33:04.567
I'll be right back.

33:24.712 --> 33:26.255
Happy birthday.

33:31.678 --> 33:32.762
Blow them out.

34:12.093 --> 34:13.970
They've given us two weeks.

34:15.763 --> 34:17.890
I can't do any more after that.

34:19.976 --> 34:21.477
Not a thing.

36:14.799 --> 36:16.801
Are you looking at my hands?

36:19.345 --> 36:21.305
They were beautiful once.

36:22.098 --> 36:24.392
Now, they give me away.

36:27.228 --> 36:28.896
Did you go through this?

37:04.348 --> 37:06.934
Let your pleasure be your guide.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.104
Your pleasure as a woman.

37:11.731 --> 37:13.316
And don't forget,

37:14.191 --> 37:17.445
there are two things that have no limit:

37:17.987 --> 37:19.488
femininity

37:20.615 --> 37:23.868
and the means of taking advantage of it.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.503
I don't believe it!

38:16.337 --> 38:17.672
Not ready yet?

38:19.674 --> 38:21.258
You're uptight, Amande.

38:21.425 --> 38:24.428
It's five to and I hate unpunctuality.

38:25.221 --> 38:27.848
Waiting sharpens the appetite.

38:29.809 --> 38:31.268
Put this on.

38:34.397 --> 38:36.399
God, this hanger's ugly.

38:37.149 --> 38:38.734
I have to finish work.

38:38.901 --> 38:40.236
No way! That'll do!

38:41.404 --> 38:42.697
Only for a minute.

38:52.331 --> 38:53.749
You look beautiful.

38:54.125 --> 38:55.418
Are we dining?

38:55.584 --> 38:56.585
Yes.

38:58.254 --> 38:59.422
And why?

38:59.588 --> 39:01.007
It's your birthday.

39:01.173 --> 39:02.591
Your twenty-third.

39:03.092 --> 39:04.802
Hey, he didn't forget.

39:19.108 --> 39:20.943
Amande, we have a guest.

39:29.285 --> 39:31.328
I thought we'd have dinner

39:32.788 --> 39:33.831
out.

39:56.479 --> 39:57.563
Shall I go?

41:37.913 --> 41:39.415
The usual, sir?

41:45.754 --> 41:46.839
You know,

41:46.922 --> 41:48.591
you can put your bag down.

41:59.101 --> 42:00.436
Watch this.

42:01.270 --> 42:02.271
Magic.

42:14.783 --> 42:16.118
Wait a minute.

42:20.039 --> 42:22.791
Taittinger, king of vintage champagnes.

42:36.263 --> 42:37.932
- Enjoy your evening.
- Thanks.

42:38.307 --> 42:39.391
To your future.

42:44.730 --> 42:45.731
Now?

42:57.076 --> 42:58.327
It's loaded.

42:59.161 --> 43:02.164
Six titanium bullets, plus an extra cartridge.

43:05.668 --> 43:06.669
I don't get it.

43:07.753 --> 43:12.341
There are three people behind you.
A woman and two men in suits:

43:12.591 --> 43:13.926
a bodyguard

43:14.009 --> 43:17.096
and a VIP. You've two bullets to kill him.

43:17.263 --> 43:19.431
Then go down to the men's room.

43:19.598 --> 43:23.102
In the end booth,
there's a small window your size.

43:23.269 --> 43:27.815
It opens onto a courtyard.
A corridor leads to the street.

43:28.857 --> 43:30.859
A car's waiting already.

43:31.819 --> 43:33.320
You've got three minutes.

43:38.200 --> 43:40.369
Please wait until I leave.

45:18.300 --> 45:19.885
Eddy, look down there.

46:09.351 --> 46:10.519
Other side.

46:17.860 --> 46:18.861
Stay there.

47:08.410 --> 47:09.495
José!

47:11.747 --> 47:12.998
Coming!

48:44.965 --> 48:48.010
Miss! Miss! Stop!

48:51.638 --> 48:52.639
Open up!

48:54.516 --> 48:56.518
There's trouble down here.

48:57.019 --> 48:58.020
Miss!

49:00.188 --> 49:03.692
Open the door, asshole!

49:20.542 --> 49:23.337
The window was walled up, Bob!

49:23.837 --> 49:26.214
The window was walled up!

49:27.716 --> 49:29.551
Of course it was.

49:40.020 --> 49:41.855
You filthy shit!

49:43.565 --> 49:45.150
Stop it, Nikita!

49:45.567 --> 49:47.152
Motherfucker!

49:47.653 --> 49:52.032
It's all over. You get out tomorrow.
You get out tomorrow!

49:52.407 --> 49:55.410
You get out tomorrow!
You get out tomorrow!

50:08.924 --> 50:11.593
Just calm down, God damn it!

50:17.849 --> 50:19.226
We have to.

50:20.102 --> 50:24.564
We have to do this sort of exercise
before letting agents out.

50:37.369 --> 50:39.371
You've worked well, Nikita.

50:42.290 --> 50:43.542
Tonight,

50:44.960 --> 50:46.420
and all these years.

50:50.799 --> 50:52.300
I'll miss you.

51:23.498 --> 51:25.417
I'll never kiss you again.

51:59.117 --> 52:01.703
What category of mission is she for?

52:01.870 --> 52:02.871
S1.

52:04.039 --> 52:05.707
Still as ambitious.

52:07.876 --> 52:09.336
Don't sit down.

52:21.056 --> 52:24.518
Six months set-up time.
I want her for September.

52:24.893 --> 52:29.564
I can't stand you.
I'd have let you die. So toe the line.

52:30.232 --> 52:32.192
You won't be warned. Clear?

52:39.908 --> 52:41.451
How many do I take?

52:41.535 --> 52:43.078
Three at the most.

52:44.746 --> 52:45.747
Jeannot.

53:00.178 --> 53:03.515
Marie Clément from Sarlat.
Nurse at the Salpétrière.

53:04.850 --> 53:07.936
You're paid at the bank
opposite the hospital.

53:08.103 --> 53:12.607
Passport, driving license,
and a bonus to help you out.

53:14.401 --> 53:15.944
Your mission code name:

53:19.197 --> 53:20.574
Joséphine.

53:33.128 --> 53:34.462
Good luck.

53:40.552 --> 53:41.636
I'm scared.

53:44.431 --> 53:45.807
The worst's over.

54:47.369 --> 54:52.332
Second floor, sunny, central heating,

54:52.499 --> 54:55.543
and, lucky for you, it's vacant.

54:56.294 --> 54:57.462
Perfect.

54:58.838 --> 54:59.881
Perfect.

56:00.150 --> 56:02.610
Are you in a hurry? Huh?

56:02.902 --> 56:04.612
No, no, not at all.

56:04.779 --> 56:07.323
Good, 'cause my register's acting up.

56:07.490 --> 56:09.868
The belt's broken, too. So...

56:10.952 --> 56:12.704
I've got plenty of time.

56:15.123 --> 56:16.416
That's good.

56:16.583 --> 56:19.127
Push it over and we'll sort it out.

56:26.718 --> 56:27.886
Ravioli.

56:32.140 --> 56:33.475
Hey, ravioli.

56:35.393 --> 56:39.814
I'm slow. I've only been here two days.
It's really complicated.

56:47.947 --> 56:50.033
Cookies. Having yourself painted?

56:55.747 --> 57:00.210
God, no price tag! Can't be worth
more than 10 francs. Call it 10!

57:10.804 --> 57:12.597
What time do you finish?

57:16.434 --> 57:17.644
Six o'clock.

57:20.522 --> 57:22.023
How about dinner?

57:26.945 --> 57:27.946
Ten francs!

57:39.999 --> 57:41.417
It's not finished.

57:51.803 --> 57:55.098
I'm embarrassed. Usually I do the inviting.

57:55.765 --> 57:59.394
You've really confused me.
I don't know what to say.

57:59.894 --> 58:01.396
Never mind. Eat.

58:03.648 --> 58:05.400
Yeah, sure, eat.

58:10.864 --> 58:11.948
It's really good.

58:12.866 --> 58:14.742
Something funny happened this morning

58:14.826 --> 58:16.369
at the store. Really funny!

58:19.539 --> 58:20.707
That neither.

58:24.711 --> 58:26.838
I know, I'll eat while it's hot.

58:43.271 --> 58:45.773
Don't start what you can't stop.

58:46.941 --> 58:48.443
Sorry, I want you.

58:48.610 --> 58:49.861
It'll get cold.

59:35.990 --> 59:37.617
You were getting it!

59:38.076 --> 59:39.953
I put the kettle on.

59:40.536 --> 59:42.622
Yeah, you did fuck all!

59:46.918 --> 59:48.169
Breakfast, Highness.

59:54.008 --> 59:56.219
There. Shit, I'll be late.

59:57.345 --> 59:59.222
Your Highness slept well?

1:00:03.434 --> 1:00:05.895
I'll invite Léon to dinner Saturday.

1:00:06.062 --> 1:00:07.063
Good.

1:00:09.816 --> 1:00:12.735
He's missing Brittany, poor guy.

1:00:13.361 --> 1:00:15.071
I'll make crêpes.

1:00:15.238 --> 1:00:16.864
You know how to?

1:00:19.784 --> 1:00:21.577
We might go into business.

1:00:21.744 --> 1:00:23.079
Doing what?

1:00:23.246 --> 1:00:25.081
Designing boats.

1:00:25.456 --> 1:00:28.251
- With him as the eraser?
- Hey, Léon's a nice guy.

1:00:30.211 --> 1:00:32.922
I've seen more intelligent bananas.

1:00:33.506 --> 1:00:34.757
Give him a break.

1:00:36.175 --> 1:00:38.344
Why don't you invite your friend?

1:00:38.553 --> 1:00:39.637
Who?

1:00:39.721 --> 1:00:43.099
You made a friend in a store, a blond,

1:00:43.933 --> 1:00:45.643
didn't you? Last week?

1:00:46.352 --> 1:00:49.564
Yes, but I don't know if she's a friend yet.

1:00:49.731 --> 1:00:51.941
This is your chance to find out.

1:00:52.108 --> 1:00:55.570
If it doesn't work,
Léon will peel her bananas.

1:01:06.998 --> 1:01:08.541
We get on well, huh?

1:01:11.419 --> 1:01:13.713
We've been together six months now.

1:01:22.722 --> 1:01:23.765
Marie,

1:01:24.766 --> 1:01:27.268
how come you never bring people here?

1:01:31.773 --> 1:01:34.359
No relatives, no friends.

1:01:36.235 --> 1:01:37.528
Nobody.

1:01:41.616 --> 1:01:43.409
Because I love only you.

1:01:44.911 --> 1:01:46.287
There you go.

1:01:52.794 --> 1:01:54.879
No! Tell him I hate his guts.

1:02:08.518 --> 1:02:09.560
Hello?

1:02:09.727 --> 1:02:10.770
<i>Joséphine?</i>

1:02:13.898 --> 1:02:14.899
Yes.

1:02:14.982 --> 1:02:17.360
<i>The George V bar, in an hour.</i>

1:02:23.825 --> 1:02:24.826
Who was it?

1:02:26.202 --> 1:02:28.996
The hospital. I'm on duty.

1:02:38.840 --> 1:02:40.007
Tea.

1:02:44.220 --> 1:02:45.638
Got a light?

1:02:46.722 --> 1:02:48.766
The Regina basement, in an hour.

1:03:19.297 --> 1:03:20.506
Don't move.

1:03:23.426 --> 1:03:24.677
Legs apart.

1:03:26.137 --> 1:03:27.430
Joséphine.

1:03:29.849 --> 1:03:30.933
Sorry.

1:03:52.497 --> 1:03:53.498
Put that on.

1:04:31.160 --> 1:04:32.870
What do I do now?

1:04:34.121 --> 1:04:35.206
You wait.

1:05:07.738 --> 1:05:09.407
Room service, good morning.

1:05:13.661 --> 1:05:14.829
Certainly, sir.

1:07:30.172 --> 1:07:31.799
What do I do now?

1:07:32.550 --> 1:07:34.051
Go home.

1:07:36.971 --> 1:07:38.139
Is that all?

1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:07.001
Hello?

1:08:07.334 --> 1:08:08.335
<i>Marie?</i>

1:08:11.046 --> 1:08:12.339
<i>Bob speaking.</i>

1:08:14.508 --> 1:08:15.676
How are you?

1:08:15.843 --> 1:08:17.678
<i>Fine. I'm just fine.</i>

1:08:19.180 --> 1:08:23.517
<i>I wanted to congratulate you.
I'm glad the first job went well.</i>

1:08:24.685 --> 1:08:25.686
Thanks.

1:08:26.896 --> 1:08:28.522
<i>Have you settled in?</i>

1:08:30.191 --> 1:08:31.525
Yes, really well.

1:08:34.028 --> 1:08:35.654
I have a fiancé.

1:08:36.489 --> 1:08:40.201
<i>Great. I'm glad everything's going well.</i>

1:08:41.994 --> 1:08:45.706
<i>I have to go now, Marie.
Good luck for the next.</i>

1:08:46.207 --> 1:08:47.208
Bob?

1:08:47.917 --> 1:08:48.918
<i>Yes?</i>

1:08:50.377 --> 1:08:53.088
I'd like you over for dinner.

1:08:55.007 --> 1:08:56.425
<i>I'd be delighted.</i>

1:09:00.346 --> 1:09:01.388
Bob?

1:09:02.223 --> 1:09:03.599
Uncle Bob?

1:09:05.267 --> 1:09:07.895
Come in. She's in the bathroom.

1:09:09.563 --> 1:09:11.273
Let me help you.

1:09:11.440 --> 1:09:15.402
You shouldn't have, for the flowers.
Champagne was a good idea.

1:09:18.072 --> 1:09:19.073
Sorry.

1:09:20.783 --> 1:09:22.618
I'm really pleased

1:09:23.619 --> 1:09:25.371
to meet you. It's...

1:09:26.956 --> 1:09:29.583
I haven't met her family before.

1:09:30.584 --> 1:09:32.461
The others aren't worth it.

1:09:39.426 --> 1:09:42.054
I'll put it in the fridge before it gets cold.

1:09:46.058 --> 1:09:49.353
Delicious. Really. Wonderful, fine, light...

1:09:49.436 --> 1:09:54.733
Stop. I'll never be able to match that.
One last compliment, okay?

1:09:55.442 --> 1:09:58.320
I haven't seen her for a while. She's...

1:09:58.988 --> 1:10:02.950
She's radiant.
I'm sure that's thanks to you as well.

1:10:03.284 --> 1:10:07.121
My charm's really deceptive.
It's not immediate.

1:10:07.830 --> 1:10:10.040
It can take 10 or 15 years.

1:10:19.508 --> 1:10:23.304
Tell me, what was she like
when she was little?

1:10:23.470 --> 1:10:25.180
No, Marco.

1:10:25.514 --> 1:10:27.558
When she was 8 or so.

1:10:27.725 --> 1:10:29.476
Marco, you promised!

1:10:29.643 --> 1:10:32.688
It's him I'm asking, Marie, not you.

1:10:32.980 --> 1:10:35.399
See? I can't even ask questions.

1:10:35.858 --> 1:10:37.693
Do I ask you things?

1:10:38.485 --> 1:10:40.404
No, but I wish you would.

1:10:40.821 --> 1:10:42.656
I love you all the same.

1:10:43.324 --> 1:10:45.075
See? She's a brick wall.

1:10:45.242 --> 1:10:46.660
So people say.

1:10:47.244 --> 1:10:48.329
Marie!

1:10:49.705 --> 1:10:51.498
At 8, she was so pretty.

1:10:57.254 --> 1:10:59.840
She had golden hair in a pigtail.

1:11:00.549 --> 1:11:03.177
There was a cousin called Caroline.

1:11:04.261 --> 1:11:08.349
Only Caroline could touch her pigtail.
No one else.

1:11:12.686 --> 1:11:14.355
She wore a ribbon,

1:11:14.855 --> 1:11:16.899
and always had white dresses.

1:11:20.194 --> 1:11:25.532
I only saw her when the family
rented a farm in the summer.

1:11:26.200 --> 1:11:29.912
Between the cousins and neighbors,
there were 20 kids,

1:11:29.995 --> 1:11:32.373
always causing trouble together.

1:11:35.042 --> 1:11:38.879
Marie had her specialty. She imitated frogs.

1:11:43.092 --> 1:11:46.428
She'd squat by the pond
and jump into the mud,

1:11:46.595 --> 1:11:50.057
going, "Croak, croak."
That cracked the other kids up.

1:11:51.725 --> 1:11:52.893
She'd come back,

1:11:53.060 --> 1:11:57.564
soaked to the skin,
but always with the same excuse:

1:11:59.066 --> 1:12:03.195
"I slipped," she'd say,
in her quiet little voice.

1:12:06.281 --> 1:12:08.283
That's just like her!

1:12:09.243 --> 1:12:11.036
Has she told you what I do?

1:12:13.372 --> 1:12:16.375
No. See, I can't ask her questions.

1:12:18.585 --> 1:12:22.965
I work in a travel agency.
I'm one of the partners.

1:12:23.799 --> 1:12:26.635
Two tickets to Venice.

1:12:29.013 --> 1:12:30.681
An engagement present.

1:12:37.771 --> 1:12:39.481
I don't know what to say.

1:12:39.815 --> 1:12:41.358
Don't say anything.

1:13:01.962 --> 1:13:04.131
Mahogany?

1:13:07.217 --> 1:13:08.302
I feel rough.

1:13:43.670 --> 1:13:45.214
Mind the step.

1:13:50.219 --> 1:13:51.428
This way!

1:13:55.849 --> 1:13:58.268
Oh, no, not the gondola, Marie!

1:13:58.602 --> 1:14:00.771
Not the gondola, not the gondola.

1:14:15.369 --> 1:14:17.246
- I want you.
- Me, too.

1:14:17.412 --> 1:14:19.206
- I'm thirsty.
- Me, too.

1:14:19.373 --> 1:14:21.458
- I'm hungry.
- Me, too.

1:14:21.625 --> 1:14:23.418
Copycat! Undo my skirt!

1:14:23.585 --> 1:14:25.420
- Right away.
- It's undone.

1:14:27.047 --> 1:14:28.215
No, take it off.

1:14:28.799 --> 1:14:29.883
Take it off!

1:14:38.725 --> 1:14:40.394
Here, hold this.

1:14:43.230 --> 1:14:46.900
We'd like some San Daniele ham,
a portion of cheese

1:14:47.067 --> 1:14:50.737
and two bottles of water.
We get thirsty after sex.

1:14:53.490 --> 1:14:54.575
She's crazy.

1:14:57.911 --> 1:14:59.329
What did he say?

1:15:00.455 --> 1:15:02.624
He has the same problem.

1:15:06.336 --> 1:15:07.754
It's all okay, then?

1:15:14.803 --> 1:15:16.138
Don't move.

1:15:20.142 --> 1:15:21.310
<i>Joséphine?</i>

1:15:24.938 --> 1:15:26.231
<i>Joséphine?</i>

1:15:30.068 --> 1:15:31.069
Yes.

1:15:31.945 --> 1:15:35.324
<i>The bathroom cabinet
has a secret compartment.</i>

1:15:43.957 --> 1:15:47.502
Fine, make that a green salad, then.

1:15:48.754 --> 1:15:49.755
Thank you.

1:15:58.263 --> 1:15:59.848
They're out of ham.

1:16:00.307 --> 1:16:02.017
Call the management.

1:16:06.146 --> 1:16:07.314
I want a bath.

1:16:08.357 --> 1:16:10.984
Relax and wait for room service.

1:16:51.066 --> 1:16:52.901
Joséphine, in position.

1:16:53.694 --> 1:16:56.363
<i>The first items are under the sink.</i>

1:17:45.412 --> 1:17:46.580
Assembly completed.

1:17:47.039 --> 1:17:48.540
<i>Open the window.</i>

1:17:54.755 --> 1:17:56.590
There's no fucking handle!

1:17:56.757 --> 1:17:57.924
<i>I don't care!</i>

1:18:01.595 --> 1:18:02.721
Sweetheart?

1:18:04.806 --> 1:18:05.807
Yes?

1:18:05.974 --> 1:18:07.893
Know what I'm thinking about?

1:18:08.643 --> 1:18:09.644
No.

1:18:10.729 --> 1:18:15.817
That day at the store. Your beauty.
I thought, "Life's a bitch.

1:18:16.485 --> 1:18:18.737
"I'll never have a girl like that

1:18:20.655 --> 1:18:22.115
"to share my life with.

1:18:24.242 --> 1:18:25.285
"Never."

1:18:31.583 --> 1:18:34.252
I can't believe I'm saying this.

1:18:40.342 --> 1:18:42.094
<i>The white boat on the canal</i>

1:18:42.260 --> 1:18:44.429
<i>with a driver in a blue shirt.</i>

1:18:45.138 --> 1:18:48.975
<i>To the left,
there are two people outside a door.</i>

1:18:50.143 --> 1:18:51.478
<i>Take aim on them</i>

1:18:51.645 --> 1:18:52.646
<i>and get ready.</i>

1:18:53.480 --> 1:18:54.815
<i>We're awaiting orders.</i>

1:19:08.620 --> 1:19:09.621
Yes.

1:19:09.955 --> 1:19:11.248
Can we talk?

1:19:11.665 --> 1:19:13.667
Okay, but stay there.

1:19:18.839 --> 1:19:19.840
Marie...

1:19:25.512 --> 1:19:27.681
I know questions piss you off.

1:19:29.975 --> 1:19:34.604
I don't know what's up,
what shit you've been through

1:19:36.022 --> 1:19:38.024
to put you in that state.

1:19:40.193 --> 1:19:44.531
But I've got an imagination, okay?
And I imagine the worst.

1:19:48.326 --> 1:19:50.370
The worst would be a relief.

1:19:57.836 --> 1:19:58.836
Who is it?

1:19:58.879 --> 1:20:00.213
Room service.

1:20:01.631 --> 1:20:02.632
Coming.

1:20:08.054 --> 1:20:11.016
<i>Hello, sir. Beautiful day, isn't it?</i>

1:20:11.183 --> 1:20:12.726
Weren't you out of ham?

1:20:12.809 --> 1:20:13.810
<i>Sorry?</i>

1:20:14.144 --> 1:20:15.687
Okay, it's no big deal.

1:20:17.147 --> 1:20:18.899
How many targets?

1:20:19.524 --> 1:20:20.901
<i>One but double.</i>

1:20:21.067 --> 1:20:22.194
What's he like?

1:20:22.360 --> 1:20:24.237
<i>I haven't been informed yet.</i>

1:20:25.155 --> 1:20:27.616
<i>My name's Roberto. If you want to call me...</i>

1:20:27.699 --> 1:20:30.076
Yeah, Harry Vederchi.

1:20:33.413 --> 1:20:36.333
<i>Target visible in 10 seconds.</i>

1:20:46.384 --> 1:20:48.011
Which one of them is it?

1:20:48.178 --> 1:20:50.180
<i>I haven't the data yet.</i>

1:20:52.933 --> 1:20:54.100
The target, damn it!

1:20:54.392 --> 1:20:55.393
<i>The woman.</i>

1:20:56.603 --> 1:20:57.938
<i>The woman in brown.</i>

1:20:58.563 --> 1:21:00.774
<i>For Christ's sake, the woman!</i>

1:21:01.525 --> 1:21:02.776
<i>The fucking woman!</i>

1:21:10.909 --> 1:21:13.036
What's up? Why don't you respond?

1:21:13.203 --> 1:21:15.121
You promised not to come in.

1:21:15.622 --> 1:21:17.958
I know, but I heard a noise...

1:21:18.291 --> 1:21:23.046
I spent 15 minutes at the door.
You could have replied!

1:21:38.728 --> 1:21:40.146
You didn't hear me, huh?

1:21:53.910 --> 1:21:54.911
Fine.

1:21:57.914 --> 1:21:59.332
This'll keep you going.

1:22:53.595 --> 1:22:54.596
Miss?

1:22:55.472 --> 1:22:58.058
Hot chocolate. Cake.

1:23:04.147 --> 1:23:05.815
Interested in my vacation?

1:23:08.443 --> 1:23:11.738
I know you and your sadistic games.

1:23:13.156 --> 1:23:16.576
You're sick, Bob. I need to tell you that.

1:23:18.161 --> 1:23:20.372
Your job's a sewer for you.

1:23:23.249 --> 1:23:24.751
I'm happy to see you.

1:23:29.547 --> 1:23:33.259
I miss the time
when I had you to myself every day.

1:23:33.802 --> 1:23:36.137
An ambassador, leaving in five months.

1:23:36.221 --> 1:23:40.433
Get him before he goes.
It's your mission. Choose your team.

1:23:40.600 --> 1:23:44.771
You've got five months.
The boss wants a clean, smooth job.

1:23:44.938 --> 1:23:46.439
I thought of you.

1:23:50.819 --> 1:23:52.779
Always on two jobs at once, huh?

1:23:54.531 --> 1:23:56.282
It's to show I love you.

1:24:30.817 --> 1:24:33.278
What a welcome! I'll try again.

1:24:40.910 --> 1:24:42.829
There, that's much better.

1:24:46.166 --> 1:24:50.003
From now on,
no more "Mr. Cashier." I resigned.

1:24:50.503 --> 1:24:52.130
- Exactly.
- To make boats?

1:24:52.297 --> 1:24:53.423
You bet!

1:24:53.590 --> 1:24:55.592
- Champagne!
- It's taken care of.

1:25:09.230 --> 1:25:11.149
Who taught you to smile?

1:25:11.316 --> 1:25:12.442
You did.

1:25:15.028 --> 1:25:16.988
I think we should move.

1:25:17.489 --> 1:25:22.202
I thought something bigger
might suit you better.

1:26:01.991 --> 1:26:06.579
He's seeing his mistress there.
You're in for a two-hour wait.

1:26:10.708 --> 1:26:12.126
Got a light?

1:26:12.669 --> 1:26:14.003
<i>See you later.</i>

1:26:25.181 --> 1:26:27.058
Sorry, I got held up.

1:26:30.019 --> 1:26:33.356
Maximilien Jedreck, posted in Paris
7 years ago.

1:26:34.899 --> 1:26:37.986
He's keeping data in the embassy safe,

1:26:38.069 --> 1:26:40.780
waiting until he goes home. Classic.

1:26:41.739 --> 1:26:43.533
What sort of data is it?

1:26:43.700 --> 1:26:46.995
All sorts: computing,
electronics, mechanics...

1:26:49.247 --> 1:26:50.748
Who's the girl?

1:26:51.457 --> 1:26:55.128
Anne-Marie. Been together for two years.
She's an art dealer.

1:26:55.295 --> 1:26:57.171
Seems safe enough.

1:26:59.424 --> 1:27:01.676
We're not interested in him.

1:27:02.677 --> 1:27:06.806
We're after the companies selling the data,

1:27:06.973 --> 1:27:09.934
and to get them, we need proof.

1:27:10.101 --> 1:27:12.562
The proof's in the embassy safe?

1:27:12.729 --> 1:27:15.398
Yeah, and the keys are in his pocket.

1:27:15.565 --> 1:27:17.150
So we know where to look.

1:27:18.902 --> 1:27:23.573
Relations are strained.
Go easy and don't hurt him.

1:27:24.574 --> 1:27:27.827
Try to work magic, not havoc.

1:27:43.968 --> 1:27:45.136
Sweetheart?

1:27:54.896 --> 1:27:56.105
Sweetheart?

1:28:04.280 --> 1:28:06.574
Shit, you scared me!

1:28:24.884 --> 1:28:28.054
How do you smell so good in a hospital?

1:28:29.764 --> 1:28:31.307
That's my secret.

1:28:37.647 --> 1:28:40.650
Tell me about
these three months of night work.

1:28:43.069 --> 1:28:44.654
Tonight's the last.

1:30:23.669 --> 1:30:25.505
Damn paintings!

1:30:26.214 --> 1:30:28.216
I'm to look after you.

1:30:35.515 --> 1:30:37.850
Marie-Hélène, how do you do?

1:30:41.979 --> 1:30:43.147
How do you do?

1:30:59.205 --> 1:31:00.998
I won't be long.

1:31:17.390 --> 1:31:19.559
That'll take some selling.

1:31:24.730 --> 1:31:25.898
Who's it by?

1:31:26.732 --> 1:31:30.945
A guy who was a pain in the neck
even before I carried his stuff.

1:31:31.237 --> 1:31:32.697
What'll you drink?

1:31:34.866 --> 1:31:36.117
Whiskey.

1:31:52.425 --> 1:31:55.469
So you work with Anne-Marie?

1:31:55.970 --> 1:31:58.556
Sometimes. Dad's gallery's near hers.

1:31:59.265 --> 1:32:00.641
In the same street?

1:32:01.267 --> 1:32:03.269
Yes, a bit further up.

1:32:07.565 --> 1:32:10.109
A bit further up, a bit further up.

1:32:17.366 --> 1:32:18.576
Ah, I see.

1:32:20.661 --> 1:32:21.787
Thank you.

1:32:23.623 --> 1:32:26.417
After the Finnish gallery.

1:32:27.001 --> 1:32:28.502
No, further up.

1:32:29.795 --> 1:32:30.838
Your elbow!

1:32:33.257 --> 1:32:34.800
Glug-glug.

1:32:46.812 --> 1:32:49.357
Lie down. It's time to sleep.

1:33:18.636 --> 1:33:21.639
<i>Christian, it's just a housewife coming up.</i>

1:33:22.682 --> 1:33:24.308
Okay, message received.

1:33:37.989 --> 1:33:39.365
<i>- Joséphine?</i>
- Yes.

1:33:40.741 --> 1:33:43.369
<i>The ambassador uses a code
with his guards.</i>

1:33:43.536 --> 1:33:45.079
Yeah, but we got it.

1:33:45.246 --> 1:33:46.372
<i>They changed it.</i>

1:33:47.707 --> 1:33:50.209
<i>Surveillance just told me.</i>

1:33:50.584 --> 1:33:52.044
So we drop everything?

1:33:52.211 --> 1:33:53.879
<i>Hold on, I'll find out.</i>

1:34:08.561 --> 1:34:10.521
<i>No, mission maintained.</i>

1:34:10.688 --> 1:34:14.400
- What do you mean?
<i>- I mean we're sending you a cleaner.</i>

1:34:16.402 --> 1:34:18.487
It's my mission, for six months...

1:34:18.571 --> 1:34:20.573
<i>Shut it! Orders are orders!</i>

1:34:20.656 --> 1:34:24.076
<i>Mission maintained with maximum priority.</i>

1:34:24.243 --> 1:34:26.746
Fuck your goddamn cleaner!

1:34:32.043 --> 1:34:33.836
Shall we get out?

1:34:38.049 --> 1:34:40.009
No, we wait and talk to him.

1:35:05.743 --> 1:35:06.952
Maurice?

1:35:15.086 --> 1:35:17.046
Maurice, who's coming up?

1:35:34.563 --> 1:35:36.315
It's okay. It's okay!

1:35:36.482 --> 1:35:38.234
Calm down! Calm down!

1:35:38.401 --> 1:35:39.443
Okay!

1:35:40.820 --> 1:35:41.946
I'll go.

1:35:46.242 --> 1:35:48.327
Victor, the cleaner.

1:35:57.169 --> 1:35:58.254
Bathroom?

1:35:58.963 --> 1:35:59.964
Over there.

1:36:00.506 --> 1:36:02.341
Bring that one, too.

1:36:13.811 --> 1:36:14.854
And the driver?

1:36:14.937 --> 1:36:16.105
In the trunk.

1:36:18.190 --> 1:36:19.942
Go on then, talk to him.

1:36:20.109 --> 1:36:23.279
Drop it, okay? Maybe you've a better idea?

1:36:36.041 --> 1:36:38.669
Victor, we've got to talk first.

1:36:39.545 --> 1:36:40.546
After.

1:36:43.382 --> 1:36:44.800
What are you doing?

1:36:44.967 --> 1:36:46.635
Cleaning up your shit.

1:36:49.346 --> 1:36:50.681
Fuck, he's not dead!

1:36:54.810 --> 1:36:56.395
You're out of your mind!

1:36:56.562 --> 1:36:58.314
Hold him down, asshole!

1:36:58.481 --> 1:37:00.733
- I've had it!
- Come and help me.

1:37:00.900 --> 1:37:03.027
Here, here! I've had it!

1:37:03.194 --> 1:37:04.487
Shut your mouth.

1:37:04.653 --> 1:37:06.155
Calm down. Help me.

1:37:06.322 --> 1:37:09.825
You go to the embassy! Here are the keys!

1:37:09.909 --> 1:37:11.076
Cut it out, asshole!

1:37:11.577 --> 1:37:12.912
Yeah, I'll cut it out!

1:37:14.747 --> 1:37:15.748
Stop it!

1:37:44.068 --> 1:37:45.110
Victor...

1:37:46.695 --> 1:37:49.198
I'd better call for orders, huh?

1:37:51.617 --> 1:37:53.869
Victor! No, no, Victor!

1:37:56.622 --> 1:37:59.250
I don't stop missions in progress.

1:37:59.833 --> 1:38:01.627
You'll make no calls.

1:38:01.794 --> 1:38:06.423
We're going to finish this
or I'll burn your face off, okay?

1:38:35.619 --> 1:38:36.745
I'd better come.

1:38:37.538 --> 1:38:41.208
No, you'd better not.
Stay here. Give me an hour.

1:38:42.418 --> 1:38:44.795
And just calm down. Calm down.

1:38:45.921 --> 1:38:47.298
See you in an hour.

1:42:41.949 --> 1:42:43.075
You said an hour.

1:42:47.412 --> 1:42:48.580
Time to clean up.

1:42:48.747 --> 1:42:52.459
No! You're not cleaning anything, Victor.

1:42:52.876 --> 1:42:55.379
We'll just go for a little drive.

1:42:56.421 --> 1:42:57.798
Okay?

1:43:01.260 --> 1:43:02.803
The mission's not over.

1:43:05.472 --> 1:43:09.393
Please, Victor. I can't take any more of this.

1:43:10.352 --> 1:43:13.146
Please, let's go!

1:43:17.860 --> 1:43:18.986
Who's that?

1:43:19.152 --> 1:43:20.320
I don't know.

1:43:21.363 --> 1:43:23.991
Sir? What's happening, sir?

1:43:25.284 --> 1:43:26.618
Oh, shit!

1:43:32.833 --> 1:43:34.543
Let's get out of here!

1:43:43.302 --> 1:43:44.303
They're ready.

1:43:45.846 --> 1:43:47.306
Nothing's wrong.

1:43:47.389 --> 1:43:48.807
False alert. Calm down.

1:44:02.529 --> 1:44:05.324
They've shut the gate. We can't get out.

1:44:06.867 --> 1:44:08.076
We'll call back.

1:44:08.243 --> 1:44:09.369
Stop!

1:44:13.248 --> 1:44:16.543
- A quick drive and we'll call back.
- Please stop!

1:46:07.988 --> 1:46:09.197
Move over.

1:46:27.716 --> 1:46:29.384
Look at me, Marie.

1:46:42.939 --> 1:46:44.566
My poor love.

1:46:48.361 --> 1:46:49.488
They'll wear you out.

1:46:51.531 --> 1:46:53.867
The job's too tough for you.

1:46:56.453 --> 1:46:58.121
Look at your tiny hands.

1:47:00.332 --> 1:47:02.417
They need protecting.

1:47:05.587 --> 1:47:07.255
They mustn't get old.

1:47:11.885 --> 1:47:14.513
Stop before it's too late.

1:47:18.934 --> 1:47:20.352
Why do you say that?

1:47:25.273 --> 1:47:26.858
I know everything, Marie.

1:47:30.445 --> 1:47:34.449
There never has been
a Marie Clément at your hospital.

1:47:38.703 --> 1:47:40.372
I also know about

1:47:43.500 --> 1:47:45.669
the stakeouts, the tailings,

1:47:46.461 --> 1:47:47.921
the video cassettes.

1:47:50.257 --> 1:47:51.800
Why didn't you say so?

1:47:54.845 --> 1:47:56.680
Because I love only you.

1:48:02.936 --> 1:48:04.729
Thank you.

1:48:23.290 --> 1:48:25.083
My little Marco.

1:48:30.422 --> 1:48:33.633
You're the most beautiful person I ever met.

1:48:39.264 --> 1:48:41.600
The only one who helped me, too.

1:48:48.940 --> 1:48:50.025
Are you going away?

1:49:02.204 --> 1:49:03.830
Got a little place for me?

1:49:05.832 --> 1:49:07.834
You're better in a big place.

1:49:32.317 --> 1:49:33.485
I love you.

1:50:42.053 --> 1:50:44.556
Mathieu! I'll go up first.

1:50:45.473 --> 1:50:47.392
I'll call if there's trouble.

1:51:00.238 --> 1:51:01.364
Come to shoot me?

1:51:02.991 --> 1:51:03.992
No.

1:51:09.414 --> 1:51:10.999
Don't you think

1:51:12.584 --> 1:51:14.377
she's paid her dues?

1:51:15.795 --> 1:51:17.922
Hasn't she the right to live?

1:51:21.718 --> 1:51:23.219
Her life's been ruined.

1:51:23.845 --> 1:51:25.013
I know all that.

1:51:25.388 --> 1:51:28.224
But she ruined a life a few years ago.

1:51:28.850 --> 1:51:30.185
A policeman's.

1:51:31.519 --> 1:51:33.188
Those are heavy dues.

1:51:35.440 --> 1:51:37.108
She killed for you, too.

1:51:37.942 --> 1:51:40.278
It only counts when it suits you.

1:51:47.118 --> 1:51:50.789
Okay, Marco,
you know what it's all about now.

1:51:51.081 --> 1:51:54.918
I'm listening. What do you want me to do?

1:51:55.960 --> 1:51:57.545
Protect her.

1:52:01.049 --> 1:52:02.300
I'll try,

1:52:03.426 --> 1:52:05.053
but she's in danger, Marco.

1:52:06.554 --> 1:52:08.723
She took the embassy documents.

1:52:09.557 --> 1:52:13.144
She's out of danger, then.
I've got the documents.

1:52:40.088 --> 1:52:41.423
She left you a note,

1:52:42.132 --> 1:52:43.508
but I tore it up.

1:52:47.512 --> 1:52:48.596
What did it say?

1:53:11.035 --> 1:53:12.454
We'll miss her, huh?

1:53:19.169 --> 1:53:20.170
Yeah.
