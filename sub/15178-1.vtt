-Mom?

-(panting)

01:56.250 --> 02:00.688
(panting continues)

03:17.765 --> 03:19.166
-Hey!

03:19.267 --> 03:22.102
What in God's name are you
doing up at this hour?

03:22.270 --> 03:25.105
And what is that?
-It was on the porch.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.375
You didn't hear the bell.
-God damn it, Derek!

03:27.475 --> 03:28.609
How many times
do I have to tell you

03:28.709 --> 03:31.445
not to open the front door
by yourself?

03:31.545 --> 03:33.414
Especially at night!

03:34.615 --> 03:36.049
(sighs)

03:36.284 --> 03:37.651
Now go to bed.

Tom!

(cries)

06:37.565 --> 06:39.467
God!

-(machine gun rivets)

10:00.167 --> 10:01.802
-Here you go, sweetie.

10:01.902 --> 10:04.738
I made everything
just the way you like it.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.143
And, look, nothing's touching
'cause I know you hate that.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.182
Come on, Derek.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.685
Say something.
Talk to me.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.753
What are you doing?

10:28.328 --> 10:30.163
I'm sorry.

10:34.434 --> 10:35.803
I've got to go
to the office later.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.404
Would you like
to come with me?

10:39.973 --> 10:41.775
-(knocking)

10:44.011 --> 10:46.279
-(machine gun rivets)

10:46.379 --> 10:48.015
-Hey.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.717
-Hey.
-How you doing?

10:49.817 --> 10:51.318
-Hello.
-Come on in.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.122
-How you doing?
-Ahh, I'm okay.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.324
How are you?
-Ooh, I'm good.

10:57.424 --> 11:00.994
How's he?
-He's still the same.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.830
He hasn't said a word
since the accident.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.798
-What did the doctor say?

11:04.898 --> 11:06.767
-The doctor told me
not to worry.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.270
He told me that
it was perfectly natural

11:10.370 --> 11:13.006
for a child to stop speaking
after a traumatic experience

11:13.106 --> 11:15.275
and he said that
it was probably temporary.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.144
On top of everything else,

11:17.244 --> 11:18.578
he won't go
into his room now.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.447
I don't know.

11:21.749 --> 11:22.615
Maybe if I take him out

11:22.750 --> 11:24.017
and get him a little
something or a toy,

11:24.117 --> 11:25.585
it'll make
him feel better.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.955
I guess I'll take him
over to Petto's later.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.289
-Nah, don't go there.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.958
They haven't got
shit in that store.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.226
-Hey!
Watch your mouth.

11:33.326 --> 11:36.429
-What did I say?
-(Christmas jingle)

11:36.529 --> 11:37.765
-Kim: You know,
I can't remember

11:37.831 --> 11:39.967
the last time I even
bought anything at Petto's.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.201
-Sarah: I know. It's so sad.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.036
Nobody goes
in there anymore.
-Kim: I know.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.471
-I like place though.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.239
Joe's always
really nice to Derek.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.808
-Announcer:
Christmas is right
around the corner.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.877
And there's always
great gifts for the holidays.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.779
Call now.

11:51.845 --> 11:52.880
-Derek?

11:53.847 --> 11:55.048
What's the matter?

11:55.148 --> 11:58.485
-Announcer: Don't delay.
So call now: 1-800-555-4747.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.153
-Derek!

12:20.808 --> 12:23.877
Derek, I know you're angry
and I know you're scared

12:23.977 --> 12:25.813
and you have
every right to be...

12:26.914 --> 12:29.282
but you also have to remember
that you're not alone.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.518
Mommy's here with you

12:31.618 --> 12:33.453
and I'm gonna protect you
and I'm gonna take care of you

12:33.553 --> 12:35.522
and everything is
gonna be all right.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.518
What's the matter, Derek?
What is it?

13:07.054 --> 13:09.489
Come on, you love
to come in this place.

13:14.561 --> 13:15.963
Mr. Petto?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.531
Joe?

13:22.469 --> 13:23.436
Joe?

13:23.536 --> 13:24.737
-(screeches)

13:24.938 --> 13:27.207
(monstrous gargles)

13:29.542 --> 13:30.878
-Pino!

13:32.913 --> 13:34.481
Take that mask off.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.217
What do you want to do?
Scare this little lad

13:37.317 --> 13:39.319
half to death?

13:39.419 --> 13:40.888
-I'm sorry.
I didn't mean
to scare you.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.056
I wouldn't--
-Ha ha, you'll have
to excuse Pino.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.724
He's a, uh...
-A teenager.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.193
-Exactly.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.327
(laughing)
Exactly.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.996
Go back into the office.
Find something to do.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.030
I'll take care
of our friends.

13:50.130 --> 13:53.333
G-- go on, Pino. Go.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.768
I don't know
what I'm gonna do
with that boy.

13:55.903 --> 13:59.439
Spends most of his time
making those god-awful masks.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.610
How are you, Sarah?

14:03.911 --> 14:04.912
-I'm okay, Joe.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.279
-I know.

14:06.379 --> 14:09.282
I know.
I heard about
your husband.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.751
Fate plays
some cruel tricks
on-- on us all.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.554
How's-- how's
the little boy?

14:14.654 --> 14:16.957
-He's not so good.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.325
-Not so good?

14:18.425 --> 14:20.093
What's the matter?

14:20.193 --> 14:21.428
Huh?

14:21.528 --> 14:23.096
Ooh, what's in
your nose there?

14:23.196 --> 14:24.998
Watch. Boop.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.133
Money?

14:26.233 --> 14:28.335
Is that where
you keep your money?

14:28.435 --> 14:29.937
(laughs)

14:30.703 --> 14:32.505
What can I do
for you, Sarah?

14:32.605 --> 14:34.274
-I would like to buy
a present for Derek.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.977
-A present for Derek?

14:37.077 --> 14:38.345
Come back over here.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.047
I think we can
find something.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.583
All right, watch this.

14:43.683 --> 14:46.019
Let's see what
we have here.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.321
-(mechanical whirring)

14:51.424 --> 14:53.593
-(Joe chatters)

15:01.301 --> 15:03.103
(Joe laughs)

15:03.203 --> 15:04.404
Huh?

15:05.305 --> 15:06.573
Huh?

15:06.673 --> 15:08.041
(Joe chatters)

15:08.141 --> 15:10.810
We can find
something here though.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.812
Now, watch-- watch his--
watch his tongue

15:13.013 --> 15:14.547
when I push his tail.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.424
Joe:
Take a look at this.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.995
A little bank, huh?

15:31.098 --> 15:32.365
Here, watch.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.035
Huh? A little dog.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.173
Oh, here--
here it is for sure.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.675
Look at this airplane.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.885
-(sighs)

15:53.020 --> 15:54.321
Maybe this was a mistake.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.523
Wait a minute, Sarah.
You're giving up too fast.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.427
-(rummaging)
-We'll get him.
We'll get him.

16:01.228 --> 16:02.462
Watch this.

16:03.263 --> 16:04.364
(chatters)

16:04.464 --> 16:06.633
If there's a way,
we'll find it, won't we?

16:11.404 --> 16:13.140
-Here, I want you
to have this.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.110
-What are you
doing with that?

16:17.210 --> 16:18.411
-It's for the boy, father.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.480
I want you to have this.
My father made it.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.115
-That's a very
nice gesture, Pino,

16:22.215 --> 16:23.516
but maybe some
other time.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.718
I think we should go, Joe.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.659
-Now, Sarah,
you just holler

16:32.759 --> 16:34.561
if you need any
of my help.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.163
-Thanks, Joe,
that's really sweet.

16:36.263 --> 16:37.530
-(chuckles)

16:47.707 --> 16:50.677
I ought to
break you in half!

16:51.544 --> 16:53.246
What kind of son are you?

16:55.082 --> 16:57.084
A real son
would help his father,

16:58.151 --> 16:59.252
but not you.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.188
You keep undermining me.

17:01.288 --> 17:03.256
I'd rather have
a son like that!

17:03.356 --> 17:04.723
-Stay away from me.

17:04.824 --> 17:07.094
-You know people
don't want to come in
the store no more?

17:07.194 --> 17:08.127
Do you?

17:08.228 --> 17:10.196
It's because of you!
-No!

17:10.297 --> 17:12.098
-Yes! Because of you--

17:13.300 --> 17:14.733
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:15.801 --> 17:17.104
Easy.

17:23.109 --> 17:23.943
-Hello there.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.179
I didn't see you come in.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.617
Is there anything
I can do for you, sir?

17:30.717 --> 17:32.152
-I'd like to
pay for this.

17:32.252 --> 17:35.222
-Yes, of course.
Just come with me.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.531
You've been buying
a lot of toys from us lately.

17:44.631 --> 17:45.965
Are you playing
Santa Claus?

17:46.166 --> 17:47.267
-Something like that.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.236
-Were you in the service?

17:49.336 --> 17:50.403
-Look, I'm kind of
in a hurry.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.971
Do you think you could
speed things up here?

17:52.205 --> 17:53.306
-Sorry, I--

17:53.406 --> 17:54.807
I was in the second world war.

17:54.907 --> 17:58.178
Cash or charge?
-Charge, charge.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.979
-(cash register dings)
-Alrighty.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.814
Nothing to do with cash.

18:03.350 --> 18:04.684
It's all right, here.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.653
Put that down.
-(imprinter clacks)

18:06.753 --> 18:08.821
-Ninety-one, that's good.

18:08.921 --> 18:12.392
fourteen ninety-five,
twelve.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.161
Six ninety-five.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.662
-Come on,
speed it up a bit.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.565
-Okay, that's
twenty-three, ninety-five,

18:18.665 --> 18:20.633
if you'll just
sign it right there.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.772
This nice item
will be amazing
for your kids.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.709
Here we go.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.412
All right, have a good
grip on the bag.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.781
Thanks for coming in!
Merry Christmas!

19:07.480 --> 19:09.216
-(knocking)

19:12.552 --> 19:14.221
(knocking)

19:15.422 --> 19:18.225
-You're out of here, brother.
-What are you talking about?

19:18.291 --> 19:19.726
-Credit's no good.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.561
I run a respectable place.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.596
I don't have time
for this kind of nonsense.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.398
-You want to calm down
for a second?

19:25.498 --> 19:26.633
Look, I just got out
of the service.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.235
There's plenty of money
left in this account.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.069
-Not according to that.
-Then there's been a mistake

19:30.237 --> 19:31.638
and I'll take care of it
in the morning.

19:31.738 --> 19:34.941
-Uh-huh, you're packing up
and leaving right now.

19:35.041 --> 19:36.676
-All right, look, what
if I give you some cash?

19:36.776 --> 19:39.279
-Cash? Cash is good.
I like cash.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.947
-Great, I get paid tomorrow.

19:41.047 --> 19:43.783
-Uh-uh, then you're
out of here tonight.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.352
-Look, what is it
with you, man?

19:45.452 --> 19:46.686
You think I'm gonna
skip out on you?

19:46.786 --> 19:48.488
I paid you for the last
two weeks, didn't I?

19:48.588 --> 19:50.323
-That was then.
This is now.

19:52.759 --> 19:53.760
-You got a kid?
-Yeah.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.362
What the hell has
that got to do with it?

19:55.462 --> 19:56.496
-You give me till tomorrow,

19:56.596 --> 19:57.797
and I'm gonna give you
a nice little toy

19:57.897 --> 19:59.266
for your kid for Christmas.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.202
-Hmm. Hmm.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.374
-Well, you don't
look like a deadbeat.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.742
I guess so.
-Great.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.345
-Mother--

20:25.858 --> 20:27.494
What you doing in there?

20:27.594 --> 20:28.795
-Here you go.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.332
-This better be good.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.833
-Oh, yeah,
it's to die for.

20:38.271 --> 20:40.807
Hey, remember,
don't open it
'til Christmas.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.855
-Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.391
-(car seat clips)

21:00.560 --> 21:02.395
-(car engine starts)

21:10.503 --> 21:15.074
-(vocalizing)

21:15.342 --> 21:18.678
(vocalizing continues)

21:20.012 --> 21:22.382
(vocalizing)

21:23.350 --> 21:24.384
What the--

21:30.723 --> 21:32.759
What the hell is this?

21:33.960 --> 21:35.862
I'll be a son of a bitch.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.832
Yeah.
(laughing)

21:43.936 --> 21:46.573
This something?
-(toy crunching)

21:53.980 --> 21:55.382
-(laughs)

21:55.448 --> 21:56.516
Look at that thing.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.585
(chuckling)

22:00.687 --> 22:01.988
Hey, hey.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.023
Hey.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.593
How do you
shut this thing off?

22:08.495 --> 22:09.596
What?

22:10.563 --> 22:11.964
The damn thing's
not working.

22:14.601 --> 22:15.868
The damn thing's broken.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.850
(humming)

22:32.652 --> 22:35.755
(humming continues)
-(buzzing)

22:45.932 --> 22:48.501
-What?
-(chirping)

22:49.502 --> 22:50.537
-(gagging)

22:51.538 --> 22:53.072
(strangled scream)

22:57.143 --> 22:59.879
(gagging)

23:01.748 --> 23:03.516
(gagging continues)

23:12.525 --> 23:14.293
-(tires screech)

23:14.461 --> 23:16.563
-(chirping, crunching)

23:16.663 --> 23:18.498
-(eyeball squelches)

23:30.677 --> 23:32.479
-(thunderous boom)

23:48.495 --> 23:53.032
-(locks clicking)

23:54.501 --> 23:58.571
-(clocks ticking)

24:00.740 --> 24:02.108
-(floorboard creaks)

24:05.011 --> 24:06.513
(floorboard creaks)

24:11.518 --> 24:12.852
(floorboard creaks)

24:46.853 --> 24:51.924
-(door creaking)

25:29.862 --> 25:31.598
-(clicking)

25:35.802 --> 25:37.670
-(footsteps approach)

25:47.647 --> 25:49.115
-(cork pops)

26:02.629 --> 26:03.630
-(sharp exhale)

26:09.836 --> 26:13.005
(footsteps)

26:13.105 --> 26:15.642
(receding footsteps)

26:30.957 --> 26:32.892
-(thumping)
-(grunting)

26:32.992 --> 26:35.194
(grunting continues)

26:37.964 --> 26:39.766
(screams)

26:39.866 --> 26:41.500
(screaming)

26:41.701 --> 26:43.736
Let go!
-(thumping)

26:56.983 --> 26:58.384
-Sarah: Derek.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.521
Derek, where are you?

27:02.722 --> 27:05.391
-(Christmas music plays)

27:05.692 --> 27:06.859
-Derek?

27:08.160 --> 27:09.896
Derek, where are you?

27:09.996 --> 27:11.698
-(Christmas music plays)

27:11.764 --> 27:13.132
-Derek.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.067
Derek!

27:15.935 --> 27:17.169
-(music stops)

27:18.838 --> 27:20.707
-Didn't you hear
me calling you?

27:20.807 --> 27:23.309
No, it's 'cause
you play that thing too loud.

27:23.409 --> 27:26.245
Come on now,
you don't want to keep
Santa waiting, do you?

27:30.783 --> 27:32.719
Did you make a list
for Santa?

27:34.286 --> 27:36.055
No, it doesn't matter.

27:48.801 --> 27:50.369
What's this?

27:53.205 --> 27:54.306
-It says it's to you,

27:54.406 --> 27:56.108
but it doesn't say
who it's from.

27:56.943 --> 27:58.044
I bet it's from Kim.

27:58.144 --> 28:00.279
It's just like her
to do something like that.

28:02.248 --> 28:03.282
Now don't get any ideas.

28:03.382 --> 28:05.084
We don't open it
'til Christmas.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.353
Come on, Derek.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.825
-(chatter)

28:17.964 --> 28:20.099
-Come on,
he'll be back soon.

28:21.367 --> 28:22.835
-(sighs)

28:25.237 --> 28:28.107
-Hey, how are the little
germ carriers today?

28:28.207 --> 28:29.776
Huh?
-Oh, not bad.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.844
-I only got pissed on twice.

28:33.045 --> 28:35.882
Oh, man,
is it hot out there?

28:35.982 --> 28:37.817
Nothing like
a California Christmas, huh?

28:37.917 --> 28:38.851
-(chuckles)

28:38.951 --> 28:40.019
Nothing like that
California cutie

28:40.119 --> 28:41.220
we have for an elf.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.356
Ho ho ho!
-(laughing)

28:45.191 --> 28:46.225
-Hey, Ricky, you
seen the boss?

28:46.325 --> 28:47.593
I got to ask him
about my check.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.228
-Uh, yeah, yeah.

28:49.328 --> 28:50.797
I think he's out
front somewhere.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.264
-Oh, great.

28:56.002 --> 28:57.937
-(mall-goers chatter)

29:08.247 --> 29:09.648
-Let me go on for you.

29:09.816 --> 29:11.383
-What are you
a masochist or something?

29:11.483 --> 29:13.252
-Listen, God damn it!
Just let me take your shift!

29:13.352 --> 29:15.822
-Okay, settle down.
Sure, no problem.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.330
-(dog barking)

30:21.587 --> 30:24.823
-(chattering)

30:58.124 --> 30:59.992
-Santa, this is Brandy.

31:01.127 --> 31:02.228
-Hello, Brandy.

31:02.328 --> 31:05.197
-I don't really
believe in Santa,

31:05.297 --> 31:07.433
but just in case...
-(paper unfolding)

31:07.533 --> 31:10.069
-I want clothes,
clothes, and more clothes,

31:10.169 --> 31:12.171
but if you don't have
that many clothes,

31:12.271 --> 31:14.373
I want a ten-speed bike,

31:14.473 --> 31:16.442
a new pair of earrings,

31:16.542 --> 31:19.545
a watch,
a pair of sunglasses,

31:19.645 --> 31:22.381
a VCR,
a yellow photo album,

31:22.481 --> 31:25.451
and the tape of
Bride of Reanimator.

31:26.285 --> 31:27.486
-Smile.

31:31.690 --> 31:34.560
-Brandy: Bye, Santa.
-Merry Christmas.

31:37.163 --> 31:39.465
-What's your boy's name?
-Derek.

31:47.073 --> 31:48.607
-Santa, this is Derek.

31:50.442 --> 31:51.543
-Derek, do you want
to tell Santa

31:51.643 --> 31:52.979
what you want for Christmas?

31:56.248 --> 31:57.249
Well, if you
don't tell him,

31:57.349 --> 31:59.585
he won't know
what to bring you.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.587
-Maybe you'd rather
whisper in my ear.

32:05.191 --> 32:06.292
-(sighs)

32:06.392 --> 32:08.460
Okay, baby.
I'll take you home.
Come on.

32:09.695 --> 32:11.263
-No!
-Let go.

32:11.363 --> 32:12.431
-Don't go.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.300
-What are you doing?
-No!

32:14.400 --> 32:15.601
-Let go of him!

32:15.701 --> 32:17.003
-No, don't go!

32:18.004 --> 32:19.105
-No.

32:19.205 --> 32:20.506
Maniac.

32:20.606 --> 32:21.773
-Smile.

32:22.008 --> 32:23.342
-Hmm.

32:51.203 --> 32:53.639
-Are you still upset
about Santa?

32:56.308 --> 32:59.245
Well, I guess even Santa
has a bad day.

32:59.345 --> 33:00.279
We won't do
any more shopping.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.481
We'll go right home, okay?

33:21.500 --> 33:23.402
-(car engine starts)

33:57.403 --> 33:59.105
-(squeaks)

34:13.518 --> 34:15.654
-(squeaking)
-(honking)

35:18.384 --> 35:19.885
-(dog barking)

35:27.193 --> 35:28.227
-Come on, Derek.

35:38.370 --> 35:39.805
-I'll be in
in a minute.

36:23.715 --> 36:25.784
-Sarah!
-Hi.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.819
-Hi, did you
just get home?

36:27.919 --> 36:29.521
-Yeah, a few
minutes ago.

36:29.621 --> 36:31.290
-Derek's with you, right?

36:31.390 --> 36:33.459
-Yes, why?
Is there something wrong?

36:33.559 --> 36:35.794
-Well, I'm not sure,
but, um...

36:35.894 --> 36:37.496
I was walking by
a few minutes ago

36:37.596 --> 36:39.665
and I thought I saw
someone moving around inside.

36:39.765 --> 36:40.766
-What?

36:40.866 --> 36:42.568
-I could be wrong, though.

36:42.668 --> 36:44.270
-Oh my God-- Derek!

36:45.304 --> 36:46.738
Derek!

36:48.574 --> 36:50.276
Derek! God.

36:52.411 --> 36:53.879
Derek!

36:55.281 --> 36:56.282
God!

36:58.850 --> 37:00.452
- (Christmas music plays)
-Oh, Derek.

37:00.552 --> 37:03.289
(relieved chuckle)
- (Christmas music plays)

37:04.556 --> 37:05.924
-(gasps)

37:07.993 --> 37:09.328
Pino!

37:35.821 --> 37:37.823
-Sarah.
-What in God's name

37:37.923 --> 37:39.358
was Pino doing
in my house?

37:39.458 --> 37:41.693
-What?
-He was in my bedroom.

37:41.793 --> 37:43.695
He scared me and Derek
half to death.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.332
-Oh, there must
be some mistake.

37:47.333 --> 37:48.500
Pino was with me all day.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.437
-Don't lie to me, Joe.
I saw him.

37:51.537 --> 37:54.540
-Pino wouldn't do
anything like that.
-I don't want to hear it!

37:54.640 --> 37:56.575
I want an explanation
and I want it now

37:56.675 --> 37:58.344
or I'm gonna
call the police!

37:59.611 --> 38:01.046
-Don't call the police.

38:01.347 --> 38:02.881
Listen to me.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.817
You don't have
to do that.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.686
Maybe I can clear
this whole thing up.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.355
You see, I...

38:11.423 --> 38:12.991
I used to own your home.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.394
-What?

38:16.462 --> 38:18.364
-I used to live
in your house.

38:18.397 --> 38:20.999
Pino and I,
we lived there
for many years.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.069
-Well, what happened?
Why did you move?

38:25.371 --> 38:26.405
-Well, it's--

38:27.406 --> 38:28.907
It wasn't by our choice.

38:29.007 --> 38:30.742
You know, my business
began to go downhill

38:30.842 --> 38:32.578
and the bank
foreclosed on me.

38:32.678 --> 38:34.680
We had to move here

38:34.780 --> 38:36.482
and things haven't been the same
since we moved here.

38:36.582 --> 38:39.050
Pino's been crying about
wanting to go back to the house.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.286
"I want to go
back to the house,"
he kept saying.

38:41.387 --> 38:44.856
Maybe that's--
that had something to do
with what happened today.

38:48.694 --> 38:51.397
-Look, Joe, I'm sorry
about your bad luck.

38:51.463 --> 38:52.564
I really am.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.633
But just because you
used to live in the house,

38:54.733 --> 38:56.702
it doesn't give Pino
license to break-in

38:56.802 --> 38:58.036
whenever he feels like it.

38:58.136 --> 38:59.938
I have a little
boy at home.

39:00.038 --> 39:01.607
I can't have
him doing that.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.041
-Of course.

39:04.142 --> 39:05.511
I understand, Sarah.

39:06.478 --> 39:07.446
-Understand this,

39:07.546 --> 39:09.548
if it happens again,
I will call the police.

39:09.648 --> 39:12.150
-Sarah, it's not gonna
happen again.

39:12.418 --> 39:13.919
You hear me?

39:15.153 --> 39:17.055
It's not gonna
happen again.

39:18.123 --> 39:19.491
Okay?

39:21.593 --> 39:22.861
-Okay.

39:32.438 --> 39:34.105
-(cuckoo clock chirps)

39:44.082 --> 39:46.618
-Pino: No! No!

39:46.718 --> 39:48.554
Go away!

39:48.654 --> 39:50.456
Leave me alone!

39:52.791 --> 39:54.793
-You have to come up
some time, Pino...

39:55.861 --> 39:57.463
and when you do,

39:57.563 --> 39:59.798
I'll be waiting for you.

40:19.417 --> 40:20.652
-Sarah: Derek.

40:29.227 --> 40:30.529
I know I said
we weren't gonna

40:30.629 --> 40:31.963
open presents
until Christmas,

40:32.063 --> 40:34.966
but I don't think
one would hurt.

40:36.468 --> 40:38.036
Go ahead, open it.

40:40.672 --> 40:42.173
Don't you want to?

40:47.879 --> 40:49.180
All right.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.449
(sighs)
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

40:54.019 --> 40:55.621
-(doorbell rings)

40:56.655 --> 40:57.989
-That must be Kim.

41:09.935 --> 41:11.770
-Hi. Oh.
-Hi.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.238
-Thanks for coming over

41:13.338 --> 41:14.840
and thanks for that
Christmas present.

41:14.940 --> 41:16.141
That was so sweet of you.

41:16.241 --> 41:18.043
-What Christmas present?
What are you talking about?

41:18.143 --> 41:19.911
-Oh, didn't you leave
a Christmas present

41:20.011 --> 41:21.647
for Derek
on the front steps?

41:21.747 --> 41:22.914
-Uh-uh.

41:23.014 --> 41:25.050
-Oh, well,
I was sure it was you.

41:25.150 --> 41:26.718
Huh.

41:31.623 --> 41:34.593
I've made some potato chips.
-Kim: Yeah, great.

41:34.693 --> 41:36.061
So what's going on?

41:37.563 --> 41:39.130
-I just had the worst day.

41:39.230 --> 41:42.167
Is it me or has
the whole world
gone crazy?

41:42.267 --> 41:45.203
I can't make sense
of anything anymore.

41:46.337 --> 41:49.575
-Look, Sarah,
it's human nature

41:49.641 --> 41:51.409
to want nice, neat answers
to everything,

41:51.577 --> 41:53.912
but unfortunately
life doesn't work that way

41:54.012 --> 41:56.615
and a lot of things
can't be explained.

41:56.715 --> 41:57.849
(sighs)

41:57.949 --> 41:59.050
I mean,
you would not believe

41:59.150 --> 42:01.019
the things that
I've been through.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.454
I hardly believe them myself.

42:03.589 --> 42:06.958
-Well, all I know is I can't
go on this way anymore.

42:07.058 --> 42:09.194
I have to get
our lives back in order,

42:09.294 --> 42:11.663
back into a normal routine.

42:12.598 --> 42:14.199
I really think
that's best for Derek...

42:15.200 --> 42:16.201
and for me.

42:17.235 --> 42:18.637
-You know what
I always say.

42:18.737 --> 42:20.271
Just trust your instincts.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.307
-That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

43:00.278 --> 43:01.512
Derek?

43:01.713 --> 43:03.314
Are you all right?

43:06.284 --> 43:08.253
-What was
that all about?

43:27.839 --> 43:29.975
-She was gonna
call the police!

43:30.075 --> 43:32.477
Do you know would'a
happened if she'd done that?

43:32.678 --> 43:35.546
You stupid, stupid fool!

43:35.681 --> 43:38.083
-Shut up! I've had enough!
-(screams)

43:39.484 --> 43:42.253
-You're drunk!
You're always drunk!

43:42.353 --> 43:44.155
-Don't you turn
your back on me

43:44.255 --> 43:45.724
when I'm talking to you.

43:46.825 --> 43:48.059
Wait a minute!

43:48.159 --> 43:50.261
Where do you
think you're going?

43:50.361 --> 43:51.897
-I don't have
to listen to you anymore!

43:51.997 --> 43:54.232
-(grunting)

43:55.400 --> 43:57.302
(screams)

43:58.403 --> 44:00.171
You bastard!

44:02.708 --> 44:05.310
Son of a bitch!
-I'm sorry, father.

44:05.410 --> 44:08.346
I'm so sorry.
-You son of a bitch.

44:13.118 --> 44:14.319
(triumphant laughs)

44:16.387 --> 44:18.156
(laughing)

44:18.256 --> 44:20.491
(screams)

44:20.726 --> 44:24.395
(screaming)

44:25.731 --> 44:28.133
-(panicked yelps)

44:39.244 --> 44:40.812
-Pino!

44:41.947 --> 44:43.148
Pino.

44:44.449 --> 44:46.117
I'm sorry.

44:46.952 --> 44:48.353
Pino!

44:48.453 --> 44:49.755
I'm sorry.

44:52.457 --> 44:54.092
Pino.

44:57.028 --> 44:58.396
Pino!

45:03.001 --> 45:04.903
Oh, God, what've I done?

45:05.937 --> 45:07.472
-(girl giggles)

45:07.572 --> 45:10.441
-Hi-ya, Lonnie.
-Hey, what ya doing, squirt?

45:10.541 --> 45:13.779
-Are you blind
or just dumber
than you look?

45:13.879 --> 45:15.180
-Don't be a wise-ass.

45:15.280 --> 45:17.348
I eat kids like you
for breakfast.

45:17.448 --> 45:19.951
It's why my shit
smells so bad.

45:20.051 --> 45:22.087
(snickers)
-What an asshole.

45:22.187 --> 45:24.289
-Hey, what'd you call me?

45:27.826 --> 45:29.394
You little shit.

45:29.494 --> 45:31.262
-Beat it, butt-head.

45:33.364 --> 45:34.866
-(chuckles)

45:42.340 --> 45:45.010
-Cheer up.
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve

45:45.110 --> 45:47.345
and things are
only gonna get better.

45:56.888 --> 45:58.289
-(sighs)

46:00.525 --> 46:03.361
-Ricky: Santa Claus killer...
-(Laura screams)

46:03.461 --> 46:05.130
-Hank:
Get the hell
out of here.

46:05.230 --> 46:07.532
-(Laura screams)

46:07.632 --> 46:10.301
-Dr. Newbury:
Laura, It's okay,
it's a dream...

46:14.840 --> 46:17.042
-Derek, honey,
I've been doing
a lot of thinking

46:17.142 --> 46:20.678
and I want you to sleep
in your own room tonight.

46:20.846 --> 46:23.281
Now, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

46:23.381 --> 46:24.883
Just try it
for one night
and I promise

46:24.983 --> 46:26.852
if it doesn't work out,
you can come right back

46:26.885 --> 46:28.353
in here and sleep with me.

46:29.855 --> 46:30.989
Will you do it for me?

46:33.391 --> 46:34.492
Please?

46:47.672 --> 46:49.507
I want you to
go right to sleep.

46:51.109 --> 46:52.477
Come on.

47:06.691 --> 47:08.526
I'll be right here
if you need me, honey.

47:37.055 --> 47:38.256
-Look out!

47:40.992 --> 47:44.262
-(Lonnie laughs)

47:45.396 --> 47:47.432
-Son of a bitch!
You're dead!

47:51.536 --> 47:52.770
-(laughing)
-(wheels whir)

47:52.938 --> 47:54.105
-(sparking)
-Whoa!

47:54.205 --> 47:57.375
Help! Help!

47:57.475 --> 47:59.077
Help!

47:59.177 --> 48:01.012
(distant screams)

48:12.657 --> 48:14.059
Can't stop!

48:14.159 --> 48:16.027
Help me!

48:16.127 --> 48:17.795
Help!

48:17.963 --> 48:19.364
-(Christmas music plays)

48:19.464 --> 48:21.766
-Lonnie: Help me! Help!

48:22.000 --> 48:23.969
(screaming)

48:25.270 --> 48:27.038
(screams)

48:32.177 --> 48:35.580
-(toy fizzles)
-(Christmas music plays)

48:39.584 --> 48:41.319
-Whoa!

48:42.553 --> 48:45.356
(screaming continues)
-(sparks blast)

48:45.456 --> 48:48.093
-(toy crunches)
-(screams)

48:48.193 --> 48:51.629
-(crunching)
-(screams)

48:58.003 --> 48:59.370
-Derek!

49:01.672 --> 49:04.542
-(screaming)

49:07.412 --> 49:09.180
-(tire screeches)

49:14.819 --> 49:17.122
-(mumbling)
-Over PA: Dr. Gladsky,
please report to O.R.

49:17.222 --> 49:19.824
Dr. Gladsky,
please report to O.R.

49:20.025 --> 49:21.626
-Couldn't make 'em stop.

49:25.063 --> 49:26.264
Stop.

49:26.364 --> 49:27.832
-Over PA: Dr. Server,
pick up line one.

49:28.033 --> 49:29.934
-I couldn't...

49:30.035 --> 49:32.637
-(hospital chatter continues)

49:34.039 --> 49:37.408
-His pulse is strong.
Don't worry, he's gonna be fine.

49:41.246 --> 49:42.580
-Kim: I love you, honey.

49:42.680 --> 49:44.649
-Hello.
-Hi, how are you?

49:45.550 --> 49:47.552
-Hi.
-Oh, tell me.

49:48.386 --> 49:49.387
-Thanks for coming.

49:49.487 --> 49:51.256
-I'm sorry I can't
stay very long.

49:51.356 --> 49:53.791
I've got to
get back to the office.

49:53.891 --> 49:56.327
How is he?
-The doctor said
he'll be fine,

49:56.427 --> 49:57.662
but look at him.

49:59.664 --> 50:01.499
-What a terrible accident.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.602
-Sarah, you think
this is an accident?

50:06.771 --> 50:08.206
Look.

50:10.308 --> 50:11.676
-What's this?

50:11.776 --> 50:13.211
-You tell me.

50:19.284 --> 50:21.519
-(doorbell rings)

50:34.732 --> 50:36.567
(doorbell rings)

50:47.312 --> 50:49.080
-Hi, Derek, hi.

50:49.180 --> 50:50.781
You don't know me, but I--

50:51.916 --> 50:53.784
Let's just say
I want to be your friend, okay?

50:54.919 --> 50:56.921
And, hey, look what
I brought you, huh?

50:57.155 --> 50:58.256
Look at that.

50:58.356 --> 51:00.525
You'll find a very
special toy in there.

51:02.160 --> 51:04.729
A very special toy
for a very special boy.

51:06.764 --> 51:08.166
Oh, come on, Derek,
It's okay.

51:08.266 --> 51:09.300
I want you to have it.
Take it.

51:09.400 --> 51:11.001
-What do you want?
-Who are you?

51:11.136 --> 51:12.803
-I'm the babysitter.
Who are you?

51:12.903 --> 51:14.172
-I'm a friend of the family.

51:14.272 --> 51:16.174
I'm looking
for Mrs. Quinn.
Is she home?

51:16.274 --> 51:18.709
-She's working late.
You'll have to contact
her at the office.

51:18.809 --> 51:21.212
-(locks)
-Hey, wait!
Open the door.

51:21.312 --> 51:22.980
Hey, what are you doing?
Open the door.

51:23.148 --> 51:25.383
-Go away!
-Look, I'm not
gonna hurt you.

51:25.483 --> 51:26.651
I told you I'm a friend.

51:26.751 --> 51:28.719
Come on, let me in.
I just want to use the phone.

51:28.819 --> 51:30.555
-I'm not supposed
to let anyone in.

51:30.655 --> 51:32.490
-Come on-- Just tell me
where Mrs. Quinn works.

51:32.590 --> 51:33.691
I'll go see her there, okay?

51:33.791 --> 51:35.726
-1200 Market Street, 5th floor!

51:35.826 --> 51:37.228
-Thank you!

52:09.627 --> 52:11.296
-(door closes)

52:27.645 --> 52:29.780
-(metal sliding)

53:14.392 --> 53:15.726
-Shit!

53:22.700 --> 53:24.269
-(key clanks)
-Oh-- sh--

53:24.369 --> 53:25.836
God!

53:27.838 --> 53:28.906
-Sarah.

53:34.545 --> 53:36.747
-(gasps)

53:43.288 --> 53:44.622
Ah.

53:45.723 --> 53:50.361
-(both panting)

54:02.407 --> 54:04.709
-As he yawned and stretched
and scratched his head,

54:04.809 --> 54:07.312
he felt two furry ears
growing from his head.

54:07.412 --> 54:10.315
How amazing?

54:10.381 --> 54:13.150
Straight away,
he searched the room
for a mirror without success.

54:13.318 --> 54:14.819
So he filled a basin
with water

54:14.919 --> 54:16.321
and peered down
at his reflection.

54:16.387 --> 54:20.057
Yes, there they were,
a pair of donkey's ears.

54:20.157 --> 54:22.927
He felt shame
and grief and anger in turn.

54:23.027 --> 54:25.330
He cried, enraged,
and beat his head
against the wall.

54:25.430 --> 54:29.334
Yet the more he roared,
the longer his ears grew.

55:06.704 --> 55:08.072
(gasps)

55:09.374 --> 55:10.575
-What took you so long?

55:10.675 --> 55:12.543
-He wouldn't go to sleep.

55:12.643 --> 55:15.380
Mrs. Quinn's gonna
be home soon.

55:16.381 --> 55:18.516
-What are we
waiting for?

55:21.652 --> 55:22.587
-(giggling)

55:22.687 --> 55:23.921
-What's your story?
Come on.

55:24.021 --> 55:26.491
-(laughing)
You-- stop.

55:26.591 --> 55:29.059
(laughing continues)

55:29.394 --> 55:30.728
Come on.

55:31.562 --> 55:32.963
(laughs)

55:33.864 --> 55:36.066
Buck, come on.
-(both laugh)

55:39.570 --> 55:41.972
-Jeez, what are you doing?

55:49.146 --> 55:51.048
-I don't have the right tool
to get in your car.

55:51.148 --> 55:53.117
So I guess you have
two choices.

55:54.051 --> 55:55.953
You could break
your window or...

55:56.887 --> 55:58.489
you can let me
give you a ride home.

55:59.490 --> 56:01.426
-I'll take the ride.
-Okay.

56:05.430 --> 56:07.064
-What?

56:08.533 --> 56:10.000
-Why did you run from me?

56:12.470 --> 56:14.839
-God, I don't know.

56:16.140 --> 56:17.908
I guess I panicked.

56:19.644 --> 56:21.078
I couldn't believe
it was you.

56:23.848 --> 56:25.315
You scared
the hell out of me.

56:25.516 --> 56:28.052
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

56:29.454 --> 56:31.556
-Things have been pretty
crazy around here lately,

56:31.656 --> 56:33.591
but I'm glad you're here.

56:34.592 --> 56:35.793
I really am...

56:38.463 --> 56:40.465
but it's been six years
since you left

56:40.498 --> 56:42.800
and I guess I never
thought I'd see you again.

56:43.601 --> 56:44.702
-Is that true?

56:44.802 --> 56:46.937
Or did you see me
every time you looked at Derek?

56:49.507 --> 56:50.875
He's my son, isn't he?

56:55.546 --> 56:57.515
-Yes.

56:57.615 --> 56:59.984
-Damn it, Sarah.
Why didn't you tell me
you were pregnant?

57:00.084 --> 57:01.586
-Would it have
made any difference?

57:01.686 --> 57:03.821
-It was my child.
I had a right to know.

57:05.656 --> 57:07.291
-I wanted to tell you, Noah.

57:07.525 --> 57:08.993
I really did.

57:09.093 --> 57:10.127
I--

57:12.497 --> 57:13.964
I--

57:15.633 --> 57:17.167
I wanted to tell you.

57:19.003 --> 57:21.739
I did.
I loved you so much...

57:21.839 --> 57:23.708
but you weren't ready
to settle down, Noah.

57:23.808 --> 57:24.875
You know that.

57:24.975 --> 57:26.744
-All I know is that you
could have trusted me

57:26.844 --> 57:28.112
to do the right thing.

57:29.079 --> 57:30.881
-I did what
I had to do.

57:36.587 --> 57:37.888
I wanted to finish college.

57:37.988 --> 57:40.124
I wanted a career.

57:41.225 --> 57:42.527
And I needed
security for that

57:42.593 --> 57:44.762
and you couldn't
give it to me
and Tom could.

57:44.862 --> 57:46.531
-Listen to me.

57:46.564 --> 57:47.698
I did a lot
of growing up

57:47.798 --> 57:48.866
when I was in the army.

57:48.966 --> 57:50.868
I know what's important now.

57:51.869 --> 57:54.004
I want to be
a good father to my son.

57:55.606 --> 57:57.542
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

58:16.694 --> 58:19.129
-(both panting)

58:25.235 --> 58:27.204
(panting continues)

58:35.212 --> 58:36.647
-Oh, jerk.

58:41.619 --> 58:43.120
-(moans)

58:48.693 --> 58:50.227
(moans)

58:59.937 --> 59:01.772
-It's in front.

59:01.872 --> 59:04.008
-(laughing)

59:04.108 --> 59:06.677
-Oh, don't rip it!
-No, I can get it off.

59:09.714 --> 59:12.082
-(moaning, panting)

59:18.623 --> 59:21.025
-(booth giggling)

59:27.898 --> 59:30.635
-(snaps)
-Bingo.

59:30.735 --> 59:31.669
(laughs)

59:31.769 --> 59:33.704
(kissing)

59:36.340 --> 59:38.342
-(panting)

59:38.643 --> 59:40.110
-Oh, God.

59:40.210 --> 59:43.213
(moaning)

59:43.313 --> 59:44.749
-Oh, sorry.

59:49.987 --> 59:52.189
-(girl laughing)

59:53.691 --> 59:55.726
-(moans)
-(panting)

59:57.227 --> 59:58.663
-(whimpers)

01:00:00.164 --> 01:00:01.265
Ooh, ooh.

01:00:01.365 --> 01:00:04.168
I really... (laughs)
-(laughing)

01:00:15.913 --> 01:00:17.114
-Yes.

01:00:22.653 --> 01:00:23.754
(barks)

01:00:23.854 --> 01:00:25.656
-(laughing)

01:01:00.791 --> 01:01:03.894
-Buck.
-Oh, baby.

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:06.463
-Buck, where did--
Where did all these
toys come from?

01:01:06.731 --> 01:01:08.198
-What?
-Toys.

01:01:08.298 --> 01:01:11.568
-I don't know.
They were here
when we got here.

01:01:11.736 --> 01:01:13.938
(kissing)
-I don't-- I don't
remember seeing them.

01:01:14.038 --> 01:01:16.240
-(pants)

01:01:17.742 --> 01:01:19.309
We weren't really
paying much attention

01:01:19.409 --> 01:01:20.410
now were we?

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:24.849
(kissing)
-(gears whir)

01:01:27.952 --> 01:01:30.087
-(kissing)
-(moaning)

01:01:41.966 --> 01:01:43.167
-Oh.

01:01:44.935 --> 01:01:46.036
Oh, yeah.

01:01:46.136 --> 01:01:47.104
Oh, that--

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:48.438
That feels good.

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:50.775
Oh, you never
touched me there before.

01:01:52.777 --> 01:01:53.778
-What?

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:57.782
-No, no, no.
Put it back.

01:01:57.848 --> 01:01:59.683
Put it back--
Put-- put--

01:01:59.784 --> 01:02:01.986
Put it back on.
-What?

01:02:02.086 --> 01:02:04.188
-Oh, never mind.

01:02:19.003 --> 01:02:20.905
-Stop.
-Stop what?

01:02:21.005 --> 01:02:22.339
-Stop.

01:03:01.078 --> 01:03:02.847
-You could use
some lotion, honey.

01:03:14.191 --> 01:03:15.559
-(hissing)

01:03:21.098 --> 01:03:22.867
-(gags)

01:03:25.035 --> 01:03:27.004
-Buck!
-Oh!

01:03:27.104 --> 01:03:28.438
-(screams)

01:03:28.538 --> 01:03:30.941
-(both scream)

01:03:33.077 --> 01:03:34.244
-Help!

01:03:36.013 --> 01:03:37.882
(screaming)

01:03:43.888 --> 01:03:44.955
-(screams)

01:03:57.601 --> 01:04:00.905
-(screaming)

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:04.008
-(grunting)

01:04:07.544 --> 01:04:09.379
-(screaming)
-(gunshot)

01:04:11.415 --> 01:04:14.018
-(gunfire)
-(screaming)

01:04:32.036 --> 01:04:33.070
-(screams)
-(blades whirring)

01:04:34.939 --> 01:04:36.540
-(both screaming)

01:04:49.253 --> 01:04:51.021
-(squelching)

01:04:54.959 --> 01:04:57.494
-(screaming continues)

01:05:09.406 --> 01:05:11.508
-(maniacal laughter)

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:35.465
-Sarah, what do you know about
that old guy from the toy store?

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.335
-You mean Joe Petto?
-Yeah.

01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:41.638
-Nothing really.
Just that he's a nice man, why?

01:05:41.738 --> 01:05:43.640
-What if I told you
he was arrested

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:46.110
for maiming some kids
several years ago?

01:05:47.311 --> 01:05:49.113
-What?
-He owned a toy store

01:05:49.213 --> 01:05:50.580
in Grove City
when I was a kid.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:52.182
-They arrested him
one Christmas

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:54.384
for booby trapping toys.

01:05:54.484 --> 01:05:55.885
He'd rig 'em with
lethal devices

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.122
and then he sent them
to kids all around town.

01:05:58.222 --> 01:05:59.489
A couple of kids
got hurt pretty bad.

01:05:59.589 --> 01:06:02.026
I think one of them even died.

01:06:02.092 --> 01:06:03.760
-I don't believe it.
-Sarah, believe it.

01:06:04.028 --> 01:06:05.062
I was there.

01:06:06.163 --> 01:06:07.164
-What reason
could he have

01:06:07.264 --> 01:06:08.465
to hurt innocent children?

01:06:08.565 --> 01:06:10.267
-From what I remember,
he went off the deep end

01:06:10.367 --> 01:06:12.169
when his wife was
killed in a car accident.

01:06:13.137 --> 01:06:14.538
She was pregnant
at the time.

01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:16.040
-Oh my God.

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:18.308
-I guess he felt
if he couldn't have
a happy family,

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:19.343
nobody else would.

01:06:19.443 --> 01:06:21.145
The moment I saw
that toy store,

01:06:21.245 --> 01:06:22.312
it all came back to me.

01:06:22.412 --> 01:06:24.114
I got worried about
you and Derek

01:06:24.214 --> 01:06:25.482
so I did some
snooping around,

01:06:25.582 --> 01:06:27.584
bought a bunch
of toys from Petto.

01:06:27.684 --> 01:06:29.286
Took 'em apart,
checked 'em out,

01:06:29.386 --> 01:06:31.388
see what I could find.
-And?

01:06:32.689 --> 01:06:34.424
-Nothing.

01:06:37.261 --> 01:06:39.096
-Oh God, Noah,
I want to go home.

01:06:39.196 --> 01:06:40.497
-Okay.

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:06.256
-(dog barking)

01:07:08.092 --> 01:07:09.259
-Noah: Sarah, wait.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:10.694
What do I tell Derek?

01:07:10.794 --> 01:07:12.762
-You can tell him
the truth.

01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:14.798
He's a smart little boy.

01:07:14.898 --> 01:07:17.101
He understands a lot more
than you think.

01:07:18.635 --> 01:07:20.404
Just don't expect
any miracles from him,

01:07:20.504 --> 01:07:22.506
that's all.
He's been through a lot.

01:07:23.773 --> 01:07:25.109
-Okay.

01:07:25.175 --> 01:07:27.444
-(screams)

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:29.646
-Help me, please!

01:07:29.746 --> 01:07:31.748
Help me! Help me!

01:07:31.848 --> 01:07:33.550
Somebody help me!

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:35.285
(cries)
-Hey, easy now.
What happened?

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:37.387
-Toys! Buck's dead!

01:07:37.487 --> 01:07:38.755
Buck's dead!
-Where's Derek?

01:07:38.855 --> 01:07:40.457
Where's Derek?
-He took him.

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:42.126
-Who took him?
Where? Who?

01:07:42.159 --> 01:07:42.992
-The man from
the toy store.

01:07:43.193 --> 01:07:44.361
-Joe Petto?
-Yes.

01:07:44.461 --> 01:07:45.795
-Oh God!
-(mechanical whirring)

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:48.132
-(screams)
-Noah: What the hell's that?

01:07:51.201 --> 01:07:52.402
All right, look,
now get inside.

01:07:52.502 --> 01:07:54.138
We'll call the police.
Come on, come on.

01:07:54.204 --> 01:07:55.439
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:07:55.539 --> 01:07:57.474
Come on, come on.
It's okay.

01:07:57.574 --> 01:08:00.344
Where're you going?
-I'm going to get my baby!

01:08:00.444 --> 01:08:02.412
-Sarah, no!
Let the police handle this.

01:08:02.512 --> 01:08:04.881
Sarah? Sarah!

01:08:05.149 --> 01:08:06.250
Sarah, come on!

01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:07.251
God damn it!

01:08:07.351 --> 01:08:08.818
-Oh my God,
what happened?

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:10.254
-I don't have time
to explain.

01:08:10.354 --> 01:08:12.289
Just call 9-1-1.
Stay with her

01:08:12.389 --> 01:08:14.724
and send the police!
-Send them where?

01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:23.267
(tires screeching)

01:08:29.639 --> 01:08:30.774
-(banging)
-Petto!

01:08:32.176 --> 01:08:33.243
Petto!

01:08:34.711 --> 01:08:36.446
Petto!

01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:38.215
Petto, where are you?
You bastard!

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:39.448
I want my boy!

01:08:39.549 --> 01:08:41.417
You hurt him
and I swear I'll kill you!

01:08:41.518 --> 01:08:42.886
Do you hear me?

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:30.334
-(mechanical whirring)

01:09:49.953 --> 01:09:52.689
-Sarah! Sarah!

01:09:52.788 --> 01:09:54.591
Sarah, where are you?

01:09:55.425 --> 01:09:56.860
Oh, shit.

01:10:03.467 --> 01:10:04.634
Sarah?

01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:26.956
-Derek.

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:31.761
-(panting)

01:11:17.374 --> 01:11:18.408
-Oh my God.

01:11:29.919 --> 01:11:31.688
-(buzzing)

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:33.457
-(gunshot)
-(grunts)

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:37.026
-(gunshots)

01:11:44.601 --> 01:11:46.536
(gunshots)

01:12:05.589 --> 01:12:06.856
-(screams)

01:12:23.607 --> 01:12:24.808
(sighs)

01:12:52.068 --> 01:12:54.137
-(screams)

01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:35.078
-Noah?

01:14:54.624 --> 01:14:55.992
(gasps)

01:14:58.061 --> 01:15:00.096
-(electrical buzzing)

01:15:00.196 --> 01:15:02.899
-(bubbling)

01:15:33.697 --> 01:15:35.599
-(slight gasp)

01:15:52.616 --> 01:15:53.617
(screams)

01:15:54.818 --> 01:15:55.985
(gasps)

01:16:00.957 --> 01:16:02.659
-I knew you'd come.

01:16:04.628 --> 01:16:06.796
Pretty mommy.

01:16:07.764 --> 01:16:08.932
-Let go of me!

01:16:09.032 --> 01:16:11.000
Who are you?
-(metal clicking)

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:13.737
-(rubber stretches)

01:16:35.324 --> 01:16:36.793
-Pino?

01:16:39.996 --> 01:16:42.666
How-- how in God's name--
-Oh, this is very simple.

01:16:42.766 --> 01:16:44.133
Really, it's very simple.

01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:46.402
All you need is
a little of that

01:16:46.670 --> 01:16:47.937
and a little of that

01:16:48.037 --> 01:16:49.839
and a little
of that.

01:16:49.939 --> 01:16:52.008
My father taught me how.

01:16:53.442 --> 01:16:55.344
My father taught me
a lot of things.

01:16:59.716 --> 01:17:00.750
-(door slams)

01:17:02.919 --> 01:17:04.220
-(locking)

01:17:11.795 --> 01:17:13.362
-Not smart.

01:17:16.165 --> 01:17:17.333
-You killed him,
didn't you?

01:17:17.433 --> 01:17:18.702
You killed Joe.

01:17:18.768 --> 01:17:20.569
-I had to.
He broke me.

01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:22.338
He always broke me.

01:17:22.438 --> 01:17:24.573
And even though
he always fixed me,

01:17:24.774 --> 01:17:26.009
I had to be sure
this time

01:17:26.109 --> 01:17:28.044
that he didn't
hurt me anymore.

01:17:58.007 --> 01:17:59.743
-Oh my God.

01:18:04.247 --> 01:18:06.149
-I tried to be
a good boy, father.

01:18:06.249 --> 01:18:09.152
All I ever wanted
to be was a good son to you,

01:18:09.252 --> 01:18:11.888
but I could never
be a real son to him.

01:18:11.988 --> 01:18:13.122
I could never be that.

01:18:13.222 --> 01:18:15.158
That's all he ever wanted,
was a real son,

01:18:15.258 --> 01:18:17.460
a real son
like Derek.

01:18:17.761 --> 01:18:18.862
-Where's my boy?

01:18:18.962 --> 01:18:21.630
-His real son died
before he was even born.

01:18:21.765 --> 01:18:23.399
That's why he made me.

01:18:23.499 --> 01:18:26.302
My father could
make anything.

01:18:31.374 --> 01:18:32.375
Well...

01:18:34.077 --> 01:18:35.879
almost anything,

01:18:35.979 --> 01:18:37.781
but I wasn't good enough.

01:18:37.847 --> 01:18:39.415
He never thought
I could love him

01:18:39.515 --> 01:18:40.784
like a real son can.

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:43.787
When he found out
I rigged those toys

01:18:43.887 --> 01:18:45.654
and sent them
to your house,

01:18:45.789 --> 01:18:48.191
he was so angry with me,

01:18:48.291 --> 01:18:49.959
but don't you see?

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:52.495
I had to.

01:18:52.796 --> 01:18:54.197
Derek has to die.

01:18:54.297 --> 01:18:56.900
Then you can be my mommy

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.667
-Damn you!
Where's Derek?

01:18:58.802 --> 01:19:00.036
-You don't need Derek!

01:19:00.136 --> 01:19:01.805
I can be your son now!

01:19:01.871 --> 01:19:03.039
I can!

01:19:03.139 --> 01:19:04.307
Don't you see?

01:19:04.407 --> 01:19:05.809
That's why I took him.

01:19:05.909 --> 01:19:07.110
I knew you'd come.

01:19:07.210 --> 01:19:08.677
I knew you'd come!

01:19:08.878 --> 01:19:09.979
-Get away from me!

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:11.848
-I can love you
like a real son.

01:19:11.948 --> 01:19:14.417
I can. I can. I can.

01:19:14.517 --> 01:19:15.952
I can! I can!

01:19:16.052 --> 01:19:18.187
I love you, mommy!
I love you!

01:19:18.287 --> 01:19:20.824
I love you!
I want you!

01:19:20.857 --> 01:19:23.059
I love you!
I love you!

01:19:23.159 --> 01:19:25.261
I love you! I love you!

01:19:25.361 --> 01:19:27.296
-(screams)
-(grunts)

01:19:28.832 --> 01:19:30.433
(strangled scream)

01:19:35.071 --> 01:19:37.540
-Damn you! Where's my boy?
I want my boy!

01:19:43.913 --> 01:19:45.181
-(screams)
-(sparking)

01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:48.317
-(explosions)
-(electrical buzzing)

01:19:54.891 --> 01:19:56.259
-He wanted a...

01:19:56.359 --> 01:19:57.861
real boy.

01:19:58.862 --> 01:19:59.595
I wasn't...

01:19:59.863 --> 01:20:02.031
good... enough.

01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:04.267
-I want my boy!
What have you done with him?

01:20:04.367 --> 01:20:06.669
-I'm your son now!

01:20:06.903 --> 01:20:09.839
Not him!

01:20:15.378 --> 01:20:17.280
Not him.

01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:19.883
-(cloth ripping)
-No!

01:20:19.983 --> 01:20:21.284
Don't hurt my baby!

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:27.323
-(quiet whimpers)

01:20:28.124 --> 01:20:29.592
-Not him.

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:30.659
-Don't!

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:31.694
Don't kill him.

01:20:31.895 --> 01:20:33.362
You can be my son.

01:20:33.462 --> 01:20:35.831
You can come
home with me.

01:20:36.632 --> 01:20:37.901
Don't kill him.

01:20:40.236 --> 01:20:41.437
-Sarah!

01:20:41.537 --> 01:20:43.506
-We're in here!
Help us!

01:20:44.507 --> 01:20:45.541
No, Pino!

01:20:51.114 --> 01:20:53.149
-(door clacking)
-Sarah!

01:20:53.249 --> 01:20:55.751
Hang on!
I'm coming.

01:20:55.952 --> 01:20:58.021
-No! Pino, don't!

01:20:58.121 --> 01:20:59.555
You can be my boy.

01:20:59.655 --> 01:21:01.490
You can be my son,
anything you want.

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:03.359
We'll go home together.

01:21:04.527 --> 01:21:06.295
Anything you want, Pino.

01:21:06.395 --> 01:21:08.031
-(whimpers)
-Don't hurt Derek.

01:21:08.131 --> 01:21:09.465
-No!

01:21:10.934 --> 01:21:12.335
Derek has to die.

01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:16.305
It's the only way.

01:21:18.041 --> 01:21:19.542
-No! Don't!

01:21:20.543 --> 01:21:21.945
-(grunts)

01:21:22.946 --> 01:21:24.080
(choking)
-Mommy, help!

01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:26.983
-Derek!
-Help me, mommy.

01:21:28.051 --> 01:21:29.252
-Derek, let go!

01:21:29.352 --> 01:21:31.520
-(banging)
-Mommy, help me!

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:33.189
-(banging)

01:21:33.289 --> 01:21:35.558
-Mommy, help me.

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:40.496
-Noah!
-Mommy!

01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:42.999
-Grab him!

01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:46.569
-(screams)

01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:01.450
-Ahh!

01:22:08.091 --> 01:22:09.125
(grunts)

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:19.435
(grunts in pain)

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:25.074
Ahh!

01:22:26.575 --> 01:22:28.677
(groans)

01:22:47.163 --> 01:22:48.664
-Father! Father!

01:22:50.233 --> 01:22:51.500
Help me.

01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:55.038
-(harsh breathing)

01:22:57.306 --> 01:22:58.707
My baby.

01:23:00.676 --> 01:23:01.710
-Father.

01:23:06.182 --> 01:23:09.152
All he wanted
was a son.

01:23:10.653 --> 01:23:11.687
He...

01:23:12.688 --> 01:23:14.090
made...

01:23:14.190 --> 01:23:15.224
me!

01:23:22.098 --> 01:23:23.666
(crying)
Father.

01:23:25.268 --> 01:23:27.636
Don't leave me!

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:39.082
-It's okay.

01:23:39.182 --> 01:23:41.550
You're safe now, Derek.
I'm gonna take care of you.

01:23:42.451 --> 01:23:44.553
-Mom, who is he?

01:23:46.422 --> 01:23:48.224
-(laughing)

01:23:50.326 --> 01:23:52.161
-I'll tell you
when we get home, honey.

01:23:53.162 --> 01:23:54.763
(screams)
-Mommy!

01:23:56.332 --> 01:23:58.467
-Die, you son of bitch!

01:24:05.841 --> 01:24:07.310
-Don't be afraid.

01:24:07.410 --> 01:24:10.146
It's only a toy, mommy.

01:24:16.519 --> 01:24:18.187
-That's right.
It's only a toy.

01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:27.196
-Let's get the hell
out of here.

01:24:42.145 --> 01:24:43.646
-Just a toy.

01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.762
-(laughing)

01:25:03.232 --> 01:25:05.268
-(orchestral music plays)
