00:35.760 --> 00:38.480
DAVID ATTENBOROUGH:
This is the entrance

00:38.480 --> 00:41.880
to one of the greatest
of natural wonders.

00:58.640 --> 01:02.640
Hang Son Doong, in Vietnam.

01:09.240 --> 01:12.960
It's thought to be the largest
cave on Earth.

01:23.120 --> 01:26.440
Here, 200 metres underground,

01:26.440 --> 01:29.440
for just a few weeks a year,

01:29.440 --> 01:34.720
sunbeams cast light through a hole
in the cave's roof.

01:52.160 --> 01:54.320
There is just enough light

01:54.320 --> 01:57.040
to enable plants to grow.

01:59.640 --> 02:01.640
But travel deeper,

02:01.640 --> 02:03.840
and darkness returns.

02:06.920 --> 02:09.320
And you reach the limit

02:09.320 --> 02:11.480
of where life can exist.

02:31.960 --> 02:35.200
These most extreme places
on our planet

02:35.200 --> 02:39.040
are often hard for us to reach.

02:40.920 --> 02:45.080
Indeed, this cave was only
recently discovered.

02:48.160 --> 02:52.440
And it contains many surprises.

02:58.960 --> 03:01.400
Cave pearls.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.560
Once tiny sand grains,

03:03.560 --> 03:06.720
now spheres the size
of tennis balls.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.360
And giant stalagmites...

03:20.800 --> 03:22.680
..formed over centuries

03:22.680 --> 03:26.000
by billions of individual
drops of water.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.240
Underground rivers have carved

03:36.240 --> 03:39.480
this great passage through
the limestone.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.520
Over five miles long

03:58.520 --> 04:00.880
and wide enough in places

04:00.880 --> 04:03.400
to accommodate a jumbo jet.

04:15.360 --> 04:17.320
And it is here,

04:17.320 --> 04:20.200
in the cave's furthest chamber,

04:20.200 --> 04:22.600
that life can be found.

04:29.640 --> 04:32.280
Translucent cave fish...

04:34.080 --> 04:35.720
..and shrimps.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.000
Isolated for millennia,

04:40.000 --> 04:44.680
feeding on little more than the
nutrients from the jungle above.

04:51.560 --> 04:54.840
The fish are completely blind

04:54.840 --> 04:58.800
and find their way about
by touch alone.

05:06.480 --> 05:10.520
These underground worlds are at
the very limit

05:10.520 --> 05:12.480
of where life can exist.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.520
But above ground,

05:23.520 --> 05:25.920
our planet's most extreme conditions

05:25.920 --> 05:28.360
are found at the poles.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.520
WIND WHISTLES

05:33.680 --> 05:35.720
Here in the north,

05:35.720 --> 05:39.920
winter temperatures can drop to
-50 degrees Celsius.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.480
For four months of the year,

05:45.480 --> 05:48.320
there is barely a glimmer
of sunlight.

05:54.640 --> 05:57.040
But here, too,

05:57.040 --> 05:59.080
life finds a way to survive.

06:03.600 --> 06:06.880
A pack of Arctic wolves.

06:12.400 --> 06:15.360
Their dense fur has protected them

06:15.360 --> 06:18.080
through months of bitter cold.

06:24.440 --> 06:28.200
But now the sun is returning.

06:40.800 --> 06:44.080
This is Ellesmere Island.

06:50.920 --> 06:56.440
The short summer gives the wolves
a chance to rebuild their strength.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.080
But here in the Arctic...

07:13.720 --> 07:16.360
..life is never easy.

07:28.320 --> 07:32.280
This pack is led by an
experienced female.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.520
If she can't lead them to food,

07:43.520 --> 07:46.960
the coming winter could be
their last.

07:58.240 --> 08:01.200
Prey is spread over
such a vast area

08:01.200 --> 08:04.400
that they must be constantly
on the move...

08:08.680 --> 08:10.480
..in search of it.

08:24.600 --> 08:28.160
But finding prey is only
the beginning.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.000
Musk oxen.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.520
They are five times the size
of a wolf.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.480
OXEN SNORT

09:05.560 --> 09:10.720
The conflict between wolf and oxen
is an ancient one,

09:10.720 --> 09:13.960
and has been waged since
the Ice Age.

09:18.880 --> 09:21.360
OXEN GRUNT

09:24.440 --> 09:28.400
Each side knows the other's tactics.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.840
The wolves try to isolate

09:45.840 --> 09:48.200
the weak or the young.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.200
A calf stumbles...

09:56.200 --> 09:59.880
..and the pack leader immediately
closes in.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.960
WOLF YELPS

10:11.480 --> 10:14.000
But the herd regroups,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.160
horns at the ready.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.520
OXEN GRUNT

10:25.280 --> 10:27.160
Stalemate.

10:28.720 --> 10:31.600
But it can only be brief.

10:55.760 --> 10:59.680
This time, the herd race
to higher ground.

11:12.520 --> 11:15.400
As they reach the top of the ridge,

11:15.400 --> 11:18.320
the males turn to defend themselves.

11:18.320 --> 11:20.040
OXEN GROWL

11:21.640 --> 11:23.960
Stalemate...

11:23.960 --> 11:25.240
..again.

11:53.520 --> 11:56.360
Every unsuccessful hunt

11:56.360 --> 11:59.160
leaves the pack weakened.

12:14.240 --> 12:17.320
This could be an easier meal.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.360
WOLF SNIFFS

12:21.360 --> 12:23.920
But something is not right.

12:27.280 --> 12:31.280
This musk ox has died
from a disease.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.000
WOLVES SNIFF

12:33.000 --> 12:36.920
Outbreaks like this are becoming
increasingly common

12:36.920 --> 12:40.160
as the climate warms across
the Arctic.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.880
Despite their hunger,

12:48.880 --> 12:51.760
the pack don't eat this carcass.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.480
Another herd.

13:18.480 --> 13:20.920
Another chance for the pack.

13:38.960 --> 13:42.680
This time, the wolves manage
to split the herd.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.960
That may improve their chances.

14:04.840 --> 14:07.840
The lead female makes sure
that the oxen

14:07.840 --> 14:10.360
do not reach the ridge again.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.680
With one less defender,
the calf is more vulnerable.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.680
OXEN CALF CALLS

14:38.680 --> 14:41.480
A much-needed meal.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.760
The wolves must continue to
make the most

14:56.760 --> 14:59.440
of the remaining weeks of summer...

15:02.680 --> 15:06.600
..so when winter returns

15:06.600 --> 15:09.520
..they're ready to endure

15:09.520 --> 15:11.920
some of the harshest conditions

15:11.920 --> 15:15.400
that exist on planet Earth.

15:37.320 --> 15:40.600
Such inhospitable extremes

15:40.600 --> 15:43.240
are not only found at the poles.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.880
As altitude increases...

15:52.880 --> 15:55.080
..temperatures fall.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.160
Here, too, animals must make the
most of the seasonal change.

16:13.880 --> 16:17.640
Particularly if you're ready
to mate.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.840
A male common frog

16:28.840 --> 16:31.440
in the French Alps.

16:37.880 --> 16:43.360
He has spent all winter
hibernating under the ice.

16:46.720 --> 16:49.720
But now it's time to wake up.

16:51.600 --> 16:56.040
Being cold-blooded, he needs
the sun to warm his body.

16:58.160 --> 17:01.320
But once it sets
in a few hours' time,

17:01.320 --> 17:03.840
he could freeze to death.

17:05.800 --> 17:09.720
So finding a mate is urgent.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.840
The weather is good.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.280
And he starts to sledge.

17:26.120 --> 17:30.320
But this is not a one-frog race.

17:31.760 --> 17:35.040
Dozens are rushing to
the breeding pool.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.960
This many frogs out on the slopes...

17:42.960 --> 17:45.160
..doesn't go unnoticed.

17:49.040 --> 17:51.360
You can't afford any slips.

17:59.760 --> 18:02.240
It was all going so well.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.800
Made it.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.640
FROG CROAKS

18:22.240 --> 18:25.320
But all the females have already
got partners.

18:28.360 --> 18:31.440
There's only one thing for it.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.320
Wrestling.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.600
Not this time.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.960
Another latecomer.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.360
A female.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.800
Could she be the one?

19:22.960 --> 19:26.720
Sometimes being late can pay off.

19:50.400 --> 19:55.000
After all his efforts, the male is
not going to let this chance

19:55.000 --> 19:57.360
slip through his fingers.

20:16.680 --> 20:21.960
This is the cedar forest of the
Atlas Mountains, in North Africa.

20:27.880 --> 20:32.240
These Barbary macaques enjoyed
a summer of plenty,

20:32.240 --> 20:34.240
but now they're paying the price.

20:38.480 --> 20:42.120
Winter here can be brutal.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.720
In some years,
over half the group perish.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.800
But in this macaque society,

20:58.800 --> 21:02.040
the more social the monkey,

21:02.040 --> 21:04.880
the more likely it is to survive.

21:07.160 --> 21:11.880
Keeping warm by huddling
can make all the difference.

21:16.120 --> 21:18.960
But they can't huddle all day.

21:22.680 --> 21:26.560
They must, eventually, break apart
to feed.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.600
They spread out, searching for food.

22:00.200 --> 22:06.120
But each night, the group return
to huddle in the cedar trees.

22:19.480 --> 22:22.000
No-one wants to be left out.

22:24.120 --> 22:27.000
Especially the infants.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.880
MACAQUE SQUEAKS

22:37.120 --> 22:41.200
This baby, somehow,
has got separated.

22:56.880 --> 23:00.200
He must get back to the life-saving
warmth of the huddle,

23:00.200 --> 23:02.320
and soon.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.400
But there is an obstacle.

23:35.880 --> 23:40.880
A grumpy male is giving the baby
a rather cold shoulder.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.360
ADULT MACAQUE GRUNTS

23:47.880 --> 23:49.920
INFANT MACAQUE CHITTERS

23:51.880 --> 23:55.960
Maybe a more subtle approach.

24:03.640 --> 24:07.680
The male decides to leave.

24:22.640 --> 24:25.160
At last...

24:25.160 --> 24:28.240
..an enthusiastic reception.

24:37.440 --> 24:40.200
The male has had less luck.

24:41.440 --> 24:44.320
It could be a long night.

24:49.440 --> 24:53.880
Huddling might seem a simple
expression of affection,

24:53.880 --> 24:57.480
but among these macaques
it's essential for survival.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.360
And not just here.

25:08.120 --> 25:12.440
5,000 miles away,
in the forests of Mexico,

25:12.440 --> 25:15.360
monarch butterflies, in millions,

25:15.360 --> 25:18.720
also huddle for survival.

25:23.320 --> 25:26.600
All of them have travelled across
North America

25:26.600 --> 25:30.200
to escape the winter that
is coming there.

25:33.120 --> 25:36.920
This forest,
at an altitude of 3,000 metres,

25:36.920 --> 25:40.080
might seem to offer little
comfort...

25:42.080 --> 25:46.160
..for temperatures here can drop
below freezing,

25:46.160 --> 25:49.680
and that could kill the butterflies.

25:54.560 --> 25:57.760
But in fact,
a thin layer of warm air

25:57.760 --> 26:01.280
trapped by the tree canopy
protects them,

26:01.280 --> 26:04.000
and will do so throughout
the winter...

26:05.760 --> 26:10.160
..provided that the forest
remains undisturbed.

26:16.360 --> 26:19.440
Unpredictable extremes
of weather, however,

26:19.440 --> 26:23.200
can disrupt this delicate balance.

26:26.600 --> 26:31.440
Strong winds can push deep into
the forest, chilling the air.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.760
WIND GUSTS

26:37.240 --> 26:39.800
Hundreds of thousands
of butterflies

26:39.800 --> 26:42.360
may be blown from the branches.

27:07.720 --> 27:14.480
In some years, storms kill 75%
of hibernating monarchs.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.400
This one has survived...

27:33.400 --> 27:36.520
..but on the ground.

27:39.800 --> 27:42.520
And night-time frosts are fatal.

27:43.960 --> 27:47.760
It can't stay here and live.

27:52.280 --> 27:55.400
It is too cold to fly,

27:55.400 --> 27:58.880
but it must get back into
the tree branches somehow.

28:01.920 --> 28:04.440
So it starts to climb.

28:13.040 --> 28:18.000
It's the equivalent of a human
climbing up a skyscraper.

28:49.040 --> 28:52.200
Safety, at last.

28:57.560 --> 29:00.640
As spring returns,

29:00.640 --> 29:04.400
the monarchs wake from their
long slumber.

29:20.600 --> 29:26.240
And now starts one of the Earth's
greatest natural spectacles.

29:58.240 --> 30:02.240
But this mass awakening
is under threat.

30:04.400 --> 30:09.120
The changing climate is creating
more extreme weather,

30:09.120 --> 30:12.200
and storms are becoming
more frequent.

30:14.560 --> 30:19.440
But, for now, this miracle
of nature continues.

30:29.480 --> 30:30.920
Fire.

30:34.800 --> 30:38.160
Unpredictable and destructive.

30:45.520 --> 30:49.520
This is South Africa's fynbos.

30:49.520 --> 30:53.200
Botanically one of the most
diverse habitats on Earth...

30:54.440 --> 30:57.640
..with over 8,000 different
plant species.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.920
Yet, every two decades,

31:02.920 --> 31:06.160
fire reduces the vegetation
to ashes.

31:13.880 --> 31:16.000
This may seem catastrophic.

31:17.200 --> 31:21.760
But just days later,
plants burst into life...

31:21.760 --> 31:24.400
..and transform the landscape.

31:28.200 --> 31:32.600
Seeds and bulbs have been waiting
for this event.

31:40.200 --> 31:44.400
90 million years of evolution
alongside fire

31:44.400 --> 31:47.880
has made some plants
so closely adapted

31:47.880 --> 31:52.120
that they can't germinate
without the presence of smoke.

31:59.360 --> 32:04.920
Remarkably, around 50% of planet
Earth's terrestrial habitats

32:04.920 --> 32:08.240
depend on fire to remain healthy.

32:15.080 --> 32:19.760
In Northern Australia, these
savannahs need seasonal fires

32:19.760 --> 32:24.040
to keep them open and prevent the
spread of the nearby forest.

32:28.120 --> 32:31.200
And they are a vital habitat

32:31.200 --> 32:33.880
for this colourful resident.

32:39.520 --> 32:43.200
The rare golden-shouldered parrot.

32:45.520 --> 32:48.840
He and his lifelong partner..

32:48.840 --> 32:53.640
rely on grassland for both food...

32:53.640 --> 32:56.000
..and a nest site.

32:57.520 --> 33:02.200
As usual, they've laid their eggs
in a hole in a termite mound.

33:02.200 --> 33:04.120
CHIRPING

33:05.800 --> 33:09.200
And now there are four chicks.

33:11.800 --> 33:16.400
The thick mud walls don't only
protect chicks from predators,

33:16.400 --> 33:20.640
but insulate them from the heat
of the scorching sun.

33:27.160 --> 33:30.320
With fledging just days away,

33:30.320 --> 33:32.880
the parents are working overtime.

33:35.680 --> 33:39.320
They collect thousands of seeds
every day.

34:01.360 --> 34:04.080
But they have a problem.

34:12.040 --> 34:16.200
The fire season is becoming
more irregular.

34:34.320 --> 34:37.480
If they are not ready to fly,

34:37.480 --> 34:40.400
chicks have no escape.

35:04.240 --> 35:08.960
But choosing to nest in a termite
mound has a surprise benefit.

35:10.840 --> 35:14.600
Their home is fireproof.

35:25.320 --> 35:31.360
Concrete-like walls keep chicks safe
from the flames outside.

35:31.360 --> 35:33.840
CHICKS CHIRP

35:40.360 --> 35:44.120
The seeds of fire grass are now
easier for the parrots

35:44.120 --> 35:47.560
to find on the blackened earth...

35:47.560 --> 35:50.720
..and they are the parrots'
favourite food.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.760
So, for both adults and
their fledgling chicks...

36:04.960 --> 36:08.240
..fires are essential for survival.

36:15.680 --> 36:18.680
But their grassland home
is shrinking,

36:18.680 --> 36:23.360
and only about 1,000 of these
lovely parrots still survive.

36:25.280 --> 36:29.760
It's through the active
management of fire by humans

36:29.760 --> 36:33.400
that their world now exists at all.

36:38.920 --> 36:43.640
Humans are affecting habitats
across planet Earth.

36:43.640 --> 36:46.040
For wildlife, all too often,

36:46.040 --> 36:49.280
the consequences have
been disastrous.

36:52.480 --> 36:55.760
ELEPHANT CALLS

36:57.960 --> 37:01.880
Elephants are among the most
tolerant of animals.

37:01.880 --> 37:04.840
ELEPHANT RUMBLES

37:04.840 --> 37:07.480
They are very long-lived,

37:07.480 --> 37:12.080
and knowledge passed between
generations enables them

37:12.080 --> 37:15.400
to find food and little-used
sources of water in times

37:15.400 --> 37:18.040
of great environmental stress.

37:20.200 --> 37:22.520
But even among elephants,

37:22.520 --> 37:25.720
survival strategies are now
beginning to fail.

37:32.800 --> 37:37.040
In Amboseli, Kenya,
years of extreme weather,

37:37.040 --> 37:40.640
combined with overgrazing
by domestic cattle,

37:40.640 --> 37:44.920
are turning these grasslands
to dust.

38:13.480 --> 38:16.880
This matriarch is over
40 years old...

38:16.880 --> 38:18.840
ELEPHANT RUMBLES

38:18.840 --> 38:20.720
..and she's already survived

38:20.720 --> 38:23.720
some of East Africa's
worst droughts.

38:26.880 --> 38:31.280
But this year, food is in extremely
short supply...

38:34.200 --> 38:37.440
..and her family are struggling
to find enough.

38:44.920 --> 38:49.040
Her youngest son is malnourished
and weak...

38:54.160 --> 38:57.560
..and is lagging behind his mother
and brother.

39:06.400 --> 39:11.160
She leads them to a pocket of acacia
forest that she knows well.

39:17.360 --> 39:20.640
But broken branches and fallen trees

39:20.640 --> 39:24.160
show that other elephants
have already been here.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.760
There is very little left
worth eating.

39:38.840 --> 39:43.640
Without food, his mother cannot
produce enough milk.

39:47.920 --> 39:49.680
She has no choice...

39:52.720 --> 39:55.280
..but to leave her weakening calf...

39:56.920 --> 39:59.960
..and try to find food elsewhere.

40:06.240 --> 40:12.400
So, she and her elder son
head off...

40:12.400 --> 40:14.680
..without him.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.480
He can only hope for their return.

41:06.360 --> 41:09.080
FLIES BUZZ

41:15.480 --> 41:20.080
But for him, time has run out.

41:55.160 --> 41:58.480
There is nothing his mother,
or anybody,

41:58.480 --> 42:01.280
could have done to save him.

42:01.280 --> 42:04.440
LOW RUMBLING

42:12.880 --> 42:16.040
With her elder son still alive,

42:16.040 --> 42:18.720
there is hope for her family.

42:20.560 --> 42:24.800
But only if they can adapt quickly.

42:35.160 --> 42:38.800
Some families are proving
to be resilient.

42:43.840 --> 42:47.640
They're travelling long distances,
away from Amboseli...

42:50.840 --> 42:55.160
..and finding new sources
of food and water.

43:12.600 --> 43:15.600
And despite the drought...

43:19.440 --> 43:22.440
..calves are being born.

43:41.240 --> 43:44.240
But given the pace of change

43:44.240 --> 43:46.600
and the challenges they face...

43:47.960 --> 43:52.080
..how many of Africa's elephants
will be able to adapt?

43:53.120 --> 43:56.560
And can they do so fast enough?

44:10.960 --> 44:13.200
The Gobi Desert.

44:15.760 --> 44:19.840
A land of sand and snow.

44:24.360 --> 44:28.280
For at least a million years,
this has been

44:28.280 --> 44:32.240
one of the most extreme habitats
on Earth.

44:36.720 --> 44:39.560
Yet, footprints in the sand

44:39.560 --> 44:43.040
reveal that there is life here.

44:49.560 --> 44:51.480
A snow leopard.

44:51.480 --> 44:54.040
Seldom seen...

44:55.360 --> 45:00.480
..especially in such hot,
arid conditions.

45:04.560 --> 45:08.840
They live up to 2,000 metres
above sea level,

45:08.840 --> 45:12.880
and patrol vast territories.

45:41.320 --> 45:44.280
They are rarely seen together.

45:52.120 --> 45:53.520
A mother...

45:56.720 --> 45:59.080
..with cubs.

46:01.280 --> 46:04.120
Filmed here for the first time

46:04.120 --> 46:06.920
in such intimate detail.

46:09.720 --> 46:11.840
LEOPARDS SNARL

46:14.960 --> 46:18.360
And they give us a glimpse
of their family life...

46:19.400 --> 46:21.360
..such as it is.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.400
WATER LAPPING

46:37.920 --> 46:41.280
Snow leopard cubs stay
with their mothers

46:41.280 --> 46:45.160
longer than those of almost
any other big cat.

46:50.960 --> 46:54.960
They remain together for over
two years...

46:57.840 --> 47:02.640
..as they learn how to master
the extremes.

47:10.040 --> 47:14.440
Which they do so well
that they are able to thrive

47:14.440 --> 47:18.400
in some of the hottest, coldest...

47:18.400 --> 47:21.280
..and highest places on Earth.

47:32.600 --> 47:36.480
Some animals,
over millions of years,

47:36.480 --> 47:40.640
have evolved ways of surviving
extremely hostile conditions.

47:43.680 --> 47:48.000
But as the extremes become
more extreme...

47:48.000 --> 47:52.200
..evolution is being outpaced.

48:00.120 --> 48:04.480
These extraordinary places
are still inhabited

48:04.480 --> 48:06.920
by some of Earth's most resilient

48:06.920 --> 48:09.080
and adaptable species.

48:12.280 --> 48:14.600
But in our rapidly changing world...

48:16.080 --> 48:21.040
..this is planet Earth as
you may never see it again.

48:27.440 --> 48:29.280
LEOPARD YOWLS

48:44.640 --> 48:47.560
DAVID ATTENBOROUGH: The most
extreme parts of our planet

48:47.560 --> 48:50.200
are not always found where
you might expect.

48:53.160 --> 48:57.160
Hidden deep in the forests
of Vietnam, a local man,

48:57.160 --> 49:00.480
Mr Ho Khanh, made an extraordinary
discovery.

49:20.080 --> 49:22.080
He didn't know it at the time,

49:22.080 --> 49:26.480
but he had stumbled upon arguably
the largest cave in the world.

49:38.720 --> 49:42.520
Inspired by Mr Ho Khanh's discovery,

49:42.520 --> 49:46.640
the Planet Earth team set out
to film Hang Son Doong.

49:48.720 --> 49:50.840
But first, they have to get there.

49:52.240 --> 49:54.520
We've left the river valley,

49:54.520 --> 49:56.960
and we're walking uphill now
to the entrance.

49:56.960 --> 49:59.000
It's just thick, thick forest.

50:00.720 --> 50:03.960
After trekking for two
gruelling days,

50:03.960 --> 50:06.800
the team finally arrive.

50:06.800 --> 50:10.160
Down here is the entrance
to Hang Son Doong,

50:10.160 --> 50:13.720
this tiny opening in this
massive jungle.

50:13.720 --> 50:16.680
It's amazing that anyone
ever found this place.

50:19.760 --> 50:22.520
We're about to go in for
the next 18 days,

50:22.520 --> 50:25.120
and it's lights on from here on out.

50:26.800 --> 50:30.280
Local experts guide the team
through the darkness.

50:31.520 --> 50:33.960
OK, I can go?  Yes, yes.

50:35.360 --> 50:38.200
HEAVY BREATHING

50:42.120 --> 50:43.600
NERVOUS CHUCKLING

50:43.600 --> 50:45.160
I'm good. I'm OK.

50:45.160 --> 50:46.840
It's just really slippery.

50:48.800 --> 50:54.320
A complex system of ropes leads
them down a 90-metre descent.

50:55.920 --> 50:57.880
RADIO CHATTER

50:59.520 --> 51:01.080
OK.

51:01.080 --> 51:02.360
Thanks.

51:06.280 --> 51:09.080
After four hours clambering
over rocks...

51:09.080 --> 51:11.080
PAN SIZZLING

51:11.080 --> 51:14.000
...they finally reach what
will be their camp.

51:22.760 --> 51:25.960
The team wake to a new day -

51:25.960 --> 51:27.920
but in darkness.

51:27.920 --> 51:29.680
How did you sleep, Luke?

51:29.680 --> 51:31.760
Quite tired.

51:31.760 --> 51:34.080
These are all of the tents
behind me.

51:34.080 --> 51:37.640
You can see they are pretty...

51:37.640 --> 51:39.080
..pretty snug.

51:39.080 --> 51:42.320
This is where we have our breakfast
every day,

51:42.320 --> 51:44.600
made by some amazing cooks.

51:46.040 --> 51:48.200
This is our charging station.

51:48.200 --> 51:50.600
Batteries for camera equipment,
batteries for our lights,

51:50.600 --> 51:52.760
our head torches,
which are so important.

51:53.800 --> 51:56.640
This is our water station.

51:56.640 --> 51:59.880
Everything that we have got has been
brought in by someone,

51:59.880 --> 52:02.680
so you can't shower or wash.

52:02.680 --> 52:04.960
And it's not just water.

52:04.960 --> 52:09.640
Tonnes of equipment has had to be
carried into the cave,

52:09.640 --> 52:11.960
every inch of the way.

52:15.120 --> 52:18.520
Now deep underground,
the powerful lights

52:18.520 --> 52:20.840
reveal just how vast this cavern is.

52:22.280 --> 52:23.960
That is amazing.

52:23.960 --> 52:25.400
Look at that. It's...

52:25.400 --> 52:27.200
It's huge!

52:29.640 --> 52:31.920
As you turn on each of the lights,

52:31.920 --> 52:34.760
another part of this enormous
chamber is revealed.

52:37.480 --> 52:40.480
It's magic. Absolutely magic.

52:43.680 --> 52:46.800
To try and capture the true scale,

52:46.800 --> 52:50.680
the team attempt a filming technique
never tried before.

52:51.920 --> 52:55.240
We're trying to do a little bit
of a dance with the drones,

52:55.240 --> 52:59.360
whereby we have one drone sort
of slightly below the other,

52:59.360 --> 53:03.480
one filming the other one lighting
a feature in the cave.

53:03.480 --> 53:05.800
It's a really tight space.

53:05.800 --> 53:07.880
You can't see anything.

53:07.880 --> 53:09.800
What could go wrong?

53:09.800 --> 53:11.640
DRONE BUZZES

53:13.520 --> 53:15.320
OK, slow down a bit.

53:16.920 --> 53:19.000
It's making everyone a little
nervous.

53:20.120 --> 53:22.720
Yeah, don't go up any higher, Luke.

53:25.080 --> 53:27.400
OK, that's a nice height.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.280
With one drone lighting
and one drone filming...

53:36.080 --> 53:41.160
..they reveal the wonder of some of
the world's largest stalagmites.

53:50.080 --> 53:53.200
As the days pass,
the team settle into

53:53.200 --> 53:56.440
the everyday routine of
life underground.

53:57.640 --> 54:01.880
This is the epitome of
being off-grid.

54:01.880 --> 54:04.000
We call that one seesaw loo

54:04.000 --> 54:06.520
because it's kind of on a rock,

54:06.520 --> 54:09.160
and every time you sit on it
and lean back,

54:09.160 --> 54:13.080
you're scared that there's
going to be a disaster.

54:14.720 --> 54:18.160
The strangest thing is
having no connection

54:18.160 --> 54:20.240
to the outside world whatsoever.

54:20.240 --> 54:23.720
Time is warped.
Nothing makes sense underground.

54:28.320 --> 54:32.480
Without daylight to guide them,
the team work round the clock

54:32.480 --> 54:35.480
to capture the cave's most
unique features.

54:37.160 --> 54:39.440
Most special of all,

54:39.440 --> 54:43.080
an event which happens only
a few weeks a year.

54:45.800 --> 54:48.240
To get there, they must navigate

54:48.240 --> 54:50.920
through boulder fields
and tight squeezes.

54:52.120 --> 54:53.560
BLEEP

55:00.400 --> 55:03.040
Here, around half a million
years ago,

55:03.040 --> 55:05.280
the cave roof collapsed,

55:05.280 --> 55:08.000
opening a window to
the outside world.

55:12.400 --> 55:15.280
The team wait for
just the right conditions.

55:16.640 --> 55:19.240
We've been sat here for hours.

55:19.240 --> 55:21.800
And finally, just on the
right-hand side of the wall,

55:21.800 --> 55:24.320
we can see the first signs of light.

55:28.240 --> 55:30.600
After weeks of darkness

55:30.600 --> 55:32.480
200 metres underground...

55:33.800 --> 55:35.640
..they see sunlight

55:35.640 --> 55:38.000
illuminate the cave floor.

55:43.040 --> 55:47.880
The way it just lights up
this massive cave...

55:47.880 --> 55:51.280
..when we've been trying to do it
with about four or five lights

55:51.280 --> 55:54.720
and barely even lighting
the smallest section.

55:54.720 --> 55:56.640
When the sun comes in, it just...

55:56.640 --> 55:58.040
HE PUFFS

56:00.320 --> 56:02.360
I think everyone's got goose bumps.

56:06.680 --> 56:11.480
I don't think I've ever appreciated
sun so much in my life.

56:13.080 --> 56:15.120
It's incredible.

56:17.840 --> 56:20.880
Look at the backlit waterfalls.

56:20.880 --> 56:23.520
They're so slow coming down.

56:23.520 --> 56:26.320
It's literally one of the best
things I've ever seen.

56:29.840 --> 56:33.760
For the crew, the sunbeam
marks a profound end

56:33.760 --> 56:36.080
to their time in the cave.

56:39.360 --> 56:41.640
We're outside!

56:41.640 --> 56:44.640
It's so green, it's so bright.

56:44.640 --> 56:48.600
Being back above ground feels like
where we belong.

56:50.560 --> 56:53.880
It's a wonder to imagine
what other extremes

56:53.880 --> 56:58.280
still lie beneath the surface
of planet Earth.

57:06.720 --> 57:09.040
Next time...

57:09.040 --> 57:11.280
..the human world...

57:16.920 --> 57:21.840
..where animals must find
new ways to survive...

57:22.960 --> 57:24.920
..amongst us.
