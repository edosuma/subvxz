00:13.073 --> 00:14.505
(door opens)

00:14.507 --> 00:16.007
She's back.

00:16.009 --> 00:17.408
She just came through the lobby.

00:17.410 --> 00:19.444
She... she seems upset
about something.

00:19.446 --> 00:22.146
Distracted.
Then now is the perfect time.

00:24.651 --> 00:26.718
Are you ready
for this, girl?

00:27.921 --> 00:29.721
All right, then.

00:32.659 --> 00:35.126
We go in, guns blazing.

00:35.128 --> 00:36.594
And don't stop.

00:36.596 --> 00:37.862
And once she goes down...

00:37.864 --> 00:39.097
Oh, God.

00:39.099 --> 00:42.100
...we need to make sure
she stays down.

00:42.102 --> 00:44.102
Okay.

00:44.104 --> 00:46.170

00:52.645 --> 00:54.746
(elevator bell dings)

01:09.963 --> 01:13.865
¶ It took seconds of your time
to take his life ¶

01:13.867 --> 01:15.600
¶ It took seconds ¶

01:17.537 --> 01:19.470
¶ For a second... ¶

01:20.540 --> 01:22.707
Stop.

01:24.811 --> 01:25.910
¶ For a second... ¶

01:25.912 --> 01:28.980
Goddamn it. Donnie,

01:28.982 --> 01:31.249
what'd you have to
go and do that for?

01:31.251 --> 01:32.316
DONOVAN:
You murdered me.

01:32.318 --> 01:34.318
IRIS: No, baby, no!

01:34.320 --> 01:35.520
We were aiming for her.

01:35.522 --> 01:36.721
Iris, we need to find her.

01:36.723 --> 01:38.189
We need to finish her!

01:38.191 --> 01:40.324
I am not leaving my son.

01:40.326 --> 01:42.760
Oh, you can't let me
die in this place.

01:42.762 --> 01:44.996
IRIS:
You are not gonna die.
I won't let you.

01:44.998 --> 01:47.198
It's too late.
Please.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.366
You gotta get me
out of here.

01:48.368 --> 01:50.768
You can't leave me.
(groans)

01:50.770 --> 01:52.336
I can't be trapped here
with her other lovers.

01:52.338 --> 01:54.205
(grunting)
Okay.

01:54.207 --> 01:56.174
All right.
Let's go.

01:56.176 --> 01:57.608
Aah! Oh.

01:57.610 --> 01:59.677
(elevator bell dings)

02:01.247 --> 02:03.581
(groaning)

02:07.187 --> 02:08.252
(elevator bell dings)

02:12.959 --> 02:15.526
Okay.

02:21.601 --> 02:23.534
(coughing)

02:23.536 --> 02:25.870
What are looking at?
Keep moving!

02:25.872 --> 02:27.872
(gasps, groans)

02:27.874 --> 02:31.275
(coughing)

02:31.277 --> 02:33.611
(car horn honking)

02:35.915 --> 02:37.882
Am I... am-am I safe?

02:37.884 --> 02:39.884
Yes, baby, yes.
Yes, baby, you're safe.

02:39.886 --> 02:41.219
You're safe.

02:41.221 --> 02:43.287
Hey. Thank you...

02:46.459 --> 02:48.526
Mom.

02:52.765 --> 02:54.866
No.

¶ ¶

04:21.921 --> 04:24.322
(screaming)

04:24.324 --> 04:25.656
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

04:27.060 --> 04:29.493
(screaming continues)
Shh... Hey, hey!

04:29.495 --> 04:31.696
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

04:31.698 --> 04:33.564
(gasping)

04:33.566 --> 04:35.566
Shh.

04:35.568 --> 04:37.168
(panting, grunts)

04:41.741 --> 04:43.407
Hold tight.

04:43.409 --> 04:45.343
There's still another
half bullet in there.

04:45.345 --> 04:47.044
No. (whimpers)

04:47.046 --> 04:48.879
(screaming)
Hey.

04:48.881 --> 04:50.348
Shh, shh!

04:50.350 --> 04:52.350
(screaming continues)

04:54.087 --> 04:56.621
(laughing)

04:56.623 --> 04:58.656
(distant, distorted moaning)

05:01.127 --> 05:05.196
(grunting, gasping)

05:05.198 --> 05:06.464
(grunting, gasping stop)

05:12.405 --> 05:14.605
You saved me.

05:14.607 --> 05:16.607
Why?

05:16.609 --> 05:19.377
Because I need you.

05:20.980 --> 05:22.480
Because, for once,

05:22.482 --> 05:24.548
I won't be left.

05:26.986 --> 05:28.552
(exhales)

05:28.554 --> 05:31.389
The bullet nicked
your femoral artery.

05:31.391 --> 05:32.957
You lost a lot of blood.

05:34.327 --> 05:36.060
I know every vein

05:36.062 --> 05:38.429
and artery in the human body.

05:38.431 --> 05:40.631
You're certainly

05:40.633 --> 05:42.900
Edward Sexton
with that needle and thread.

05:42.902 --> 05:45.803
They don't call me
Hypodermic Sally for nothing.

05:51.177 --> 05:54.412
You're not
going to leave me, right?

05:56.949 --> 05:59.917
They always leave.

06:03.256 --> 06:07.291
Promise me you won't leave me.

06:07.293 --> 06:11.329
I'm not going anywhere.

06:17.603 --> 06:19.670
Good.

06:24.444 --> 06:27.345
This kid I grew up with,

06:27.347 --> 06:31.148
Juan Moacanda.

06:31.150 --> 06:33.884
I gave him his first hand job.

06:33.886 --> 06:36.687
We were from the Valley.

06:36.689 --> 06:38.389
Anyway, he went on

06:38.391 --> 06:41.058
to become
this giant drug dealer.

06:41.060 --> 06:44.195
His stuff
was the shit.

06:44.197 --> 06:46.497
I used to sell it for him.

06:46.499 --> 06:50.201
Made a lot of
good friends, you know?

06:50.203 --> 06:53.637
It was always,
"I'm hurting, Sally."

06:53.639 --> 06:56.974
"Can you hook me up, Sally?"

06:56.976 --> 06:59.643
Except for Nick Harley

06:59.645 --> 07:01.912
and Tina Black.

07:01.914 --> 07:05.149
The musicians?

07:05.151 --> 07:07.151
I saw them once.

07:07.153 --> 07:08.753
At the Troubadour.

07:08.755 --> 07:10.721
They were almost good.

07:10.723 --> 07:12.356
Hey!

07:12.358 --> 07:14.425
They<i> were</i> good.

07:16.329 --> 07:18.396
They were good to me.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.500
ENGINEER:
<i> Same pickup point.</i>

07:22.502 --> 07:24.335
NICK: Yeah, okay.
SALLY:<i> They liked my songs.</i>

07:24.337 --> 07:26.337
(humming a tune)
ENGINEER: Still rolling.

07:26.339 --> 07:28.172
SALLY:
<i> They thought I had talent. </i>
NICK: Two, three,

07:28.174 --> 07:29.840
four...
(guitar starts playing)

07:29.842 --> 07:31.509
¶ Has anybody seen ¶

07:31.511 --> 07:33.911
¶ My buddy Pain... ¶

07:33.913 --> 07:35.946
(Tina sighs)

07:35.948 --> 07:38.516
¶ You went out ¶

07:38.518 --> 07:40.217
¶ For a pack of Pall Malls... ¶

07:40.219 --> 07:41.852
(squeals)

07:41.854 --> 07:43.287
(sighs)

07:43.289 --> 07:44.522
¶ My buddy Pain... ¶

07:44.524 --> 07:46.557
(both moaning)

07:46.559 --> 07:48.259
You want me to cut that out

07:48.261 --> 07:50.628
and keep going or should
we start from the top?

07:50.630 --> 07:53.864
NICK: I don't know.
What do you think, Sally?

07:53.866 --> 07:56.500
I mean, it's your song, right?

07:58.471 --> 07:59.804
It's hot.

07:59.806 --> 08:01.639
I think you should leave it.

08:01.641 --> 08:03.874
Sally, you damn pervert.

08:03.876 --> 08:05.709
I love you!

08:07.914 --> 08:09.580
You holding?

08:09.582 --> 08:11.115
Always.

08:11.117 --> 08:12.316
Well, then we're done here.

08:12.318 --> 08:14.118
Let's get a room

08:14.120 --> 08:16.120
and melt our faces away.

08:16.122 --> 08:17.288
(Tina giggles)

08:17.290 --> 08:19.457
SALLY:<i> They treated me</i>
<i> like an artist.</i>

08:19.459 --> 08:21.759
(all laughing)
NICK: Oh, your grandest suite

08:21.761 --> 08:24.895
for me and my two nieces,
please.

08:24.897 --> 08:27.731
All the rooms are
basically the same.

08:27.733 --> 08:30.167
And I'm gonna need a deposit.

08:30.169 --> 08:32.570
What the shit, lady--
based on the way we look?

08:32.572 --> 08:34.405
Has there ever been
a more aptly named

08:34.407 --> 08:37.608
style of music than grunge?

08:37.610 --> 08:39.977
NICK: Man, this is what
rock and roll looks like now.

08:39.979 --> 08:41.245
It's not hair spray

08:41.247 --> 08:43.314
and spandex anymore.

08:43.316 --> 08:46.517
Just put a towel down on
anything if you sit on it naked.

08:46.519 --> 08:49.487
Poets' skid marks stain
as much as us commoners.

08:49.489 --> 08:50.821
(chuckles)

08:50.823 --> 08:52.523
(bell dings twice)

08:54.660 --> 08:56.327
And for the record,

08:56.329 --> 09:00.998
<i> Shout at the Devil</i> was
an underrated masterpiece.

09:02.034 --> 09:04.101
Oh, come on.
(gasps) Yes.

09:04.103 --> 09:05.669
(sultry laugh)

09:12.645 --> 09:13.711
(gasps)

09:15.348 --> 09:17.815
Come on. I hear it feels
like a constant orgasm.

09:17.817 --> 09:19.650
Oh, it's gonna
hurt like hell.

09:19.652 --> 09:21.819
Perfect.

09:21.821 --> 09:23.621
I'll write a song about it.

09:23.623 --> 09:25.389
Pull it out,
I want to see.

09:25.391 --> 09:27.858
It'll be easy.

09:27.860 --> 09:30.528
I call it the Big Veiny,
for obvious reasons.

09:30.530 --> 09:32.630
(both women laugh)

09:32.632 --> 09:33.797
¶ You know what to do about ¶

09:33.799 --> 09:35.032
¶ When you can't ¶

09:35.034 --> 09:36.800
¶ Seem to do anything about it ¶

09:36.802 --> 09:40.504
(moans)
¶ Just go, go ¶

09:40.506 --> 09:41.672
¶ Go ¶

09:41.674 --> 09:43.207
(grunts, moans)
¶ Go... ¶

09:43.209 --> 09:44.742
Nick...

09:44.744 --> 09:47.578
I just want to crawl inside
your skins and masturbate.

09:47.580 --> 09:49.980
(giggles)

09:49.982 --> 09:52.182
Got to stay close, man.

09:52.184 --> 09:53.751
Thick as thieves.
That's how you get

09:53.753 --> 09:56.020
a number-one record--
you make it real.

09:56.022 --> 09:58.489
I know how
we can get close.

09:58.491 --> 09:59.723
Make it real.

09:59.725 --> 10:01.225
Do you trust me?

10:01.227 --> 10:04.261
¶ Go, go... ¶

10:04.263 --> 10:07.731
I don't know
why the idea came to me.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.833
I just...

10:09.835 --> 10:11.702
(whimpering)

10:11.704 --> 10:14.405
I wanted us to be so close.

10:14.407 --> 10:17.708
(screaming)

10:17.710 --> 10:19.977
I just loved them so much.

10:23.182 --> 10:25.182
Tell me you love me.

10:25.184 --> 10:27.184
I didn't want them
to ever leave.

10:27.186 --> 10:29.219
Tell me you love me, yeah,

10:29.221 --> 10:30.955
tell me you love me...

10:32.525 --> 10:34.558
No. No, no, no.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.427
No, no, no!

10:38.898 --> 10:40.030
Help me!

10:40.032 --> 10:43.267
Pretty sure they're dead.

10:43.269 --> 10:44.802
Well, almost.

10:44.804 --> 10:47.204
Please call the doctor.
They need help.

10:47.206 --> 10:49.940
Not sure what I can do
to help them.

10:51.711 --> 10:52.910
They'll be messing themselves
soon enough.

10:52.912 --> 10:53.911
I'll come back.

10:53.913 --> 10:54.778
Please.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.747
Postmortem excrement

10:56.749 --> 10:57.881
is the biggest

10:57.883 --> 10:59.650
stain challenge of them all.

10:59.652 --> 11:02.052
No! No, please, help.

11:02.054 --> 11:04.989
Please... (grunting)

11:04.991 --> 11:07.224
(muffled screaming)

11:07.226 --> 11:08.492
(chuckling)

11:12.164 --> 11:14.965
<i> I had done an excellent job.</i>

11:14.967 --> 11:16.300
<i> I wouldn't be abandoned</i>
<i> this time.</i>

11:16.302 --> 11:17.401
(screams)

11:17.403 --> 11:19.470
<i> Not for five days.</i>

11:23.442 --> 11:26.076
<i> On day two, he showed up.</i>

11:27.513 --> 11:29.647
(panting)

11:31.484 --> 11:33.651
<i> He tortured me for three days.</i>

11:33.653 --> 11:37.488
<i> I couldn't take it anymore.</i>

11:37.490 --> 11:40.057
(screaming)

11:42.428 --> 11:45.329
After that...

11:45.331 --> 11:48.966
this was my spot.

11:48.968 --> 11:52.770
It's the only place
I had ever experienced any real

11:52.772 --> 11:55.606
belonging or happiness.

11:55.608 --> 11:58.275
You have serious
abandonment issues.

12:00.379 --> 12:03.881
That's why I saved you.

12:03.883 --> 12:05.883
I'm flattered.

12:05.885 --> 12:07.885
Yeah, well,
I don't want you, bitch.

12:07.887 --> 12:10.487
(exhales)

12:10.489 --> 12:12.690
I want John.

12:12.692 --> 12:14.291
And he left.

12:14.293 --> 12:16.627
With that battle-ax
of a wife

12:16.629 --> 12:21.965
and your sweet angel child.

12:21.967 --> 12:25.469
I want him back in the hotel
and I want him dead,

12:25.471 --> 12:29.406
here with me,
forever. So...

12:29.408 --> 12:33.911
I'm gonna need you to do it.

12:36.148 --> 12:39.917
Your timing is off.

12:40.886 --> 12:43.654
I'm gonna get you well.

12:43.656 --> 12:45.656
I'm gonna
bring you blood.

12:45.658 --> 12:47.057
As much as you need.

12:47.059 --> 12:49.059
Not human blood.

12:49.061 --> 12:52.563
I need blood
like mine.

12:52.565 --> 12:54.998
Would you bring
Donovan here?

12:55.000 --> 12:56.433
I can feed off him.

12:56.435 --> 13:00.270
Just a little bit at a time.

13:00.272 --> 13:01.605
Until I'm well.

13:03.109 --> 13:04.208
Donovan is dead.

13:04.210 --> 13:05.275
(chuckles)

13:11.217 --> 13:14.118
He was very beautiful.

13:26.198 --> 13:27.798
(door shuts)

13:27.800 --> 13:29.299
Do you remember where

13:29.301 --> 13:30.634
your room is?

13:30.636 --> 13:32.970
I'll take you.

13:38.644 --> 13:41.278
You want something
to eat?

13:41.280 --> 13:43.180
How 'bout some fruit?

13:44.150 --> 13:46.383
It's rotten.

13:47.753 --> 13:50.754
How long has it been
since you were home?

13:50.756 --> 13:53.323
Too long.

13:55.161 --> 13:59.229
Now that we have Holden, it's
gonna go back to the way it was.

14:00.232 --> 14:03.433
We're gonna be a family again.

14:03.435 --> 14:05.235
How are you going to
explain this to Grandma?

14:05.237 --> 14:06.770
He looks like a baby.

14:06.772 --> 14:08.772
Holden's supposed to be
my big brother.

14:08.774 --> 14:10.440
Grandma doesn't
have to know.

14:10.442 --> 14:12.176
This is our secret.

14:12.178 --> 14:13.777
As long as
we take our medicine,

14:13.779 --> 14:15.746
we'll be healthy.

14:16.682 --> 14:18.515
You mean drink blood?

14:18.517 --> 14:21.685
Is that what
happened to Jasper?

14:21.687 --> 14:23.754
Are you going to eat me, too?
Of course not.

14:23.756 --> 14:25.155
You'll always be safe.

14:25.157 --> 14:27.157
How are you
going to eat?

14:27.159 --> 14:28.692
JOHN:
That's my job.

14:28.694 --> 14:31.094
It's nothing
you have to worry about.

14:34.934 --> 14:37.100
(panting)

14:37.102 --> 14:39.036
(moans)

14:42.474 --> 14:45.475
(panting)

14:45.477 --> 14:47.978
What the hell
are they doing here?

14:47.980 --> 14:49.813
You're getting worse.

14:49.815 --> 14:51.982
You're not
healing yourself

14:51.984 --> 14:53.350
the way you should be.

14:53.352 --> 14:55.118
You said it. You need blood.

14:56.322 --> 14:57.721
Your blood.

14:57.723 --> 14:59.723
No.

14:59.725 --> 15:01.491
There must be another way.

15:01.493 --> 15:03.527
You don't have
a lot of options.

15:03.529 --> 15:05.796
And you need a fix.

15:05.798 --> 15:07.231
Now.

15:07.233 --> 15:09.233
(Countess sobs)

15:09.235 --> 15:11.568
(panting)

15:11.570 --> 15:14.404
It'll kill them.

15:16.508 --> 15:20.143
I'd rather die.

15:24.416 --> 15:27.217
You're not saving anyone.

15:27.219 --> 15:30.087
What do you think's
gonna happen to your children?

15:30.089 --> 15:32.089
Hmm?

15:32.091 --> 15:36.026
It won't take long for Iris
and Liz to mow them down.

15:36.028 --> 15:38.362
(gasps)

15:38.364 --> 15:40.364
No!

15:40.366 --> 15:43.367
Please. Please, I can't.

15:43.369 --> 15:45.335
I can't!
It's okay, Mommy.

15:45.337 --> 15:47.304
Let us help you.

15:57.683 --> 16:00.183
COUNTESS:
My sweet... my...

16:03.756 --> 16:06.623
Hold on to Mommy.

16:06.625 --> 16:08.458
(crying)

16:08.460 --> 16:09.626
No!

16:09.628 --> 16:10.794
<i> (knocking on door)</i>

16:10.796 --> 16:12.195
(echoing):
<i> No!</i>

16:22.908 --> 16:24.241
You did it.

16:24.243 --> 16:27.244
Big hotel.

16:27.246 --> 16:30.047
Big furnace.

16:34.253 --> 16:36.253
Thank you.

16:36.255 --> 16:38.088
(sniffles)

16:38.090 --> 16:40.257
I just couldn't have him
going down that chute

16:40.259 --> 16:41.725
like so much trash.

16:41.727 --> 16:45.262
Of course not.

16:45.264 --> 16:47.798
Is there any sign of her?

16:47.800 --> 16:51.835
Not yet. Hopefully she crawled
into some corner and died.

16:51.837 --> 16:53.603
It's not likely.

16:53.605 --> 16:56.073
No.

16:57.076 --> 16:58.408
Could I have a minute?

16:58.410 --> 17:00.410
Oh.

17:16.362 --> 17:18.862
(sighs)

17:20.332 --> 17:21.598
(sniffles)

17:38.384 --> 17:40.283
Oh, Donovan.

17:43.322 --> 17:46.890
Sweet baby.

17:46.892 --> 17:50.293
You did always have
that mean streak.

17:50.295 --> 17:51.862
(chuckles, sniffles)

17:54.400 --> 17:58.368
I always said that orneriness
came from your father.

18:00.906 --> 18:02.472
But that's not so.

18:04.376 --> 18:06.877
That was pure me.

18:08.981 --> 18:12.649
Oh, we were so much alike.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.621
Maybe that's why
we couldn't be close.

18:24.229 --> 18:27.397
But I did love you.

18:27.399 --> 18:29.933
I swear to God I did.

18:32.104 --> 18:34.604
(shuddering breath)

18:37.876 --> 18:39.576
(sighs)

18:54.626 --> 18:57.694
How are you feeling?

19:01.467 --> 19:04.534
Leave me alone.

19:13.612 --> 19:15.045
My goodness,

19:15.047 --> 19:18.582
did we have a little accident?

19:18.584 --> 19:21.718
I want every speck of him gone.

19:23.789 --> 19:25.789
Oh, my.

19:25.791 --> 19:27.124
Who was that?

19:27.126 --> 19:29.559
My son.

19:33.298 --> 19:35.765
Would you like him
back in the can?

19:35.767 --> 19:37.667
No.

19:39.438 --> 19:41.404
Use the vacuum.

19:42.975 --> 19:44.741
Where's the bag?

19:45.677 --> 19:47.110
It's bagless.

19:47.112 --> 19:49.613
(chuckles)

19:49.615 --> 19:53.550
(chuckles) I'll have him
all scooped up in a jiffy!

19:54.920 --> 19:57.187
(vacuum whirring)

20:17.042 --> 20:19.509
¶ ¶

20:46.538 --> 20:48.972
¶ ¶

21:03.255 --> 21:06.156
IRIS: Are you sure
this is a good idea?

21:06.158 --> 21:08.058
We can't go back now.
We didn't kill her.

21:08.060 --> 21:09.826
We'll never get another
chance like that.

21:09.828 --> 21:12.028
She is gonna eat me
the minute

21:12.030 --> 21:13.563
you let her out
of that cage.

21:13.565 --> 21:15.031
Ramona and I go way back.

21:15.033 --> 21:16.900
I can guarantee you
that she'll at least

21:16.902 --> 21:18.768
listen to me.

21:18.770 --> 21:20.770
And we share a common enemy.

21:20.772 --> 21:22.539
And, hopefully,
she'll see that that

21:22.541 --> 21:25.542
supersedes any recent mistakes
you may have made.

21:25.544 --> 21:27.444
So we're desperate.

21:27.446 --> 21:29.212
Just out of options.

21:29.214 --> 21:31.715
We'll just point her in
the direction of the Countess

21:31.717 --> 21:33.550
and get out of the way.

21:33.552 --> 21:34.951
Uh-huh.

21:34.953 --> 21:37.621
IRIS:
What could go wrong?

21:39.791 --> 21:41.925
(beeping)

21:42.894 --> 21:44.127
(clicking)

21:52.537 --> 21:53.937
(creaking)

21:53.939 --> 21:56.606
(gasps)
What the...? Oh!

21:57.776 --> 22:01.211
Oh. How... did
that get in here?

22:05.550 --> 22:06.783
Oh...

22:06.785 --> 22:08.718
(Iris gasps)

22:08.720 --> 22:09.986
Look at all of them.

22:09.988 --> 22:12.222
Oh, God.

22:19.998 --> 22:22.432
(Liz groans)

22:22.434 --> 22:25.068
(Iris groans)

22:25.070 --> 22:26.369
That sad soul.

22:30.075 --> 22:31.641
They've all been drained.

22:33.512 --> 22:34.978
This place is a meat locker.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.260
Oh...

22:50.262 --> 22:51.928
Run...!
(Iris screams)

22:51.930 --> 22:53.163
Run!
Oh, God!

22:53.165 --> 22:55.432
Not another step!

22:56.335 --> 22:57.600
And don't you dare point

22:57.602 --> 22:59.002
either of those things at me!

23:03.975 --> 23:05.642
So...

23:05.644 --> 23:07.877
the Countess sent<i> you</i> here

23:07.879 --> 23:10.447
to finish me off.

23:10.449 --> 23:12.015
Oh...
Well, the game
isn't over

23:12.017 --> 23:14.117
till<i> I</i> do
the finishin'.

23:14.119 --> 23:16.119
Liz Taylor?

23:16.121 --> 23:18.521
Since when are you working
with the Countess?

23:18.523 --> 23:20.390
No, no, no, no.

23:20.392 --> 23:22.659
We're all working
against the Countess.

23:22.661 --> 23:23.760
Not that one.

23:25.997 --> 23:28.365
Bitch put me in that hole
and made me hungry

23:28.367 --> 23:29.699
for blood and revenge.

23:29.701 --> 23:32.168
(inhales sharply)
Eatin' you...

23:32.170 --> 23:35.338
is gonna make me feel
doubly good.

23:35.340 --> 23:37.340
Told you.
No.

23:37.342 --> 23:39.309
We need her.

23:39.311 --> 23:41.211
We need all of us
if we're going to end

23:41.213 --> 23:42.712
the Countess's grip
on this place,

23:42.714 --> 23:44.914
her grip on all of us.
Please,

23:44.916 --> 23:47.384
sweetheart.
Don't you "sweetheart" me.

23:47.386 --> 23:49.753
I have been scratched at,
conked out,

23:49.755 --> 23:51.755
and locked up.

23:51.757 --> 23:53.189
But Mama...

23:53.191 --> 23:55.825
is on a course correction.

23:55.827 --> 23:57.260
LIZ:
Ramona...

23:57.262 --> 23:58.895
I should have listened to you
about the Countess,

23:58.897 --> 24:01.731
but I was a love-addled idiot,

24:01.733 --> 24:03.900
so, please... forgive me.

24:07.172 --> 24:08.705
I feel you.

24:08.707 --> 24:12.976
But I'm just not feeling
like myself right now.

24:13.912 --> 24:15.445
I fed...

24:15.447 --> 24:19.115
but something
not agreein' with me.

24:19.117 --> 24:21.351
Oh. Oh, but we can fix that.

24:21.353 --> 24:23.253
Oh, yeah.
I have...

24:23.255 --> 24:25.054
some of the Countess's
purified stash

24:25.056 --> 24:26.389
up at the lounge.

24:26.391 --> 24:28.925
I don't need any
of her baby aspirin.

24:28.927 --> 24:30.593
I need to take a life

24:30.595 --> 24:32.729
to bring me back to life!

24:32.731 --> 24:35.632
Well... that can
also be arranged.

24:37.269 --> 24:39.269
<i> (elevator bell dings)</i>

24:39.271 --> 24:40.437
We can't just
go out on the street

24:40.439 --> 24:41.938
and bash somebody in the head.

24:41.940 --> 24:44.107
If you have another idea,
I'm all ears.

24:44.109 --> 24:45.809
(elevator bell dings)

24:45.811 --> 24:48.111
Hello?

24:48.113 --> 24:49.779
Is anybody here?

24:51.383 --> 24:53.216
Hey, either of y'all
work here?

24:56.455 --> 24:58.688
Dinner is served.

25:05.931 --> 25:07.997
IRIS: Did you have
a reservation?

25:07.999 --> 25:09.766
Uh, yeah. One name:

25:09.768 --> 25:10.900
Queenie.

25:13.171 --> 25:14.304
Oh, yes, I have you.

25:14.306 --> 25:15.772
And you're gonna be
staying with us

25:15.774 --> 25:17.173
for three nights.

25:17.175 --> 25:19.442
Are you
traveling alone?
Just me.

25:19.444 --> 25:22.245
And what brings
you to L.A.?

25:22.247 --> 25:23.680
Drew Carey.

25:23.682 --> 25:25.982
I'm here to win big money
on<i> The Price Is Right.</i>

25:25.984 --> 25:27.450
Wonderful.

25:27.452 --> 25:28.618
Yeah.

25:28.620 --> 25:30.286
(chuckles)
Well, I hope you

25:30.288 --> 25:32.255
get called to
"come on down!"

25:32.257 --> 25:33.490
(both chuckle)

25:33.492 --> 25:34.958
That's actually
guaranteed.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.793
Between you and me,

25:36.795 --> 25:38.528
my Supreme did
a little somethin'-somethin'

25:38.530 --> 25:40.296
to my ticket, so...

25:40.298 --> 25:42.131
it's enchanted.

25:42.133 --> 25:43.933
I thought
you looked familiar!

25:43.935 --> 25:45.668
I saw you...

25:45.670 --> 25:48.204
I saw you on CNN!

25:48.206 --> 25:49.706
You're one of
the witches!

25:49.708 --> 25:51.007
My God.

25:51.009 --> 25:52.008
Oh, my God.

25:52.010 --> 25:54.010
Oh! It's this
amazing story.

25:54.012 --> 25:55.678
There's a whole
gaggle of them.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.213
They're a
bona fide coven.

25:57.215 --> 25:59.682
They wear chic black,
and they do spells...

25:59.684 --> 26:02.318
Oh, my goodness! I hope
you didn't have to marry Satan

26:02.320 --> 26:03.620
or anything to join.

26:03.622 --> 26:06.289
That's actually ignorant
and offensive.

26:06.291 --> 26:07.357
We're born that way.

26:07.359 --> 26:08.958
We'll all part
of an ancient bloodline.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.393
Blood?

26:10.395 --> 26:11.694
Really?

26:11.696 --> 26:13.630
IRIS:
That's fascinating.

26:13.632 --> 26:15.732
Liz, why don't you
go upstairs

26:15.734 --> 26:18.501
and make sure
she has everything in her room

26:18.503 --> 26:20.169
she'll need during her stay.

26:20.171 --> 26:22.305
Oh. Of course.

26:22.307 --> 26:24.574
I'll get
right on that.

26:24.576 --> 26:26.643
I'll just be a few minutes.

26:26.645 --> 26:28.044
IRIS:
Mm-hmm.

26:31.316 --> 26:33.316
(door creaks)

26:33.318 --> 26:34.918
(exhales):
Ooh.

26:36.021 --> 26:38.354
There's a lot of bad juju
in this room.

26:38.356 --> 26:40.223
Oh, that's... the
previous tenant.

26:40.225 --> 26:41.658
He's gone.

26:41.660 --> 26:44.193
Ice machine is down the hall,
and local calls are free.

26:44.195 --> 26:47.564
<i> (distant scream echoes)</i>

26:47.566 --> 26:48.932

26:48.934 --> 26:50.366
LIZ: Plenty of
fluffy towels

26:50.368 --> 26:51.734
in the bathroom--
I just checked.

26:51.736 --> 26:53.770
You're all set.

26:55.340 --> 26:56.439
<i> (distant scream echoing)</i>

26:56.441 --> 26:58.942
No. I have a dark feeling.

26:58.944 --> 27:01.277
I'll take another room, please.

27:01.279 --> 27:03.947
Oh, we're close
to capacity,

27:03.949 --> 27:05.515
but I'll check
when I go downstairs.

27:05.517 --> 27:07.850
Meanwhile,
you can freshen up.

27:07.852 --> 27:10.186
You'll want to be
tip-top for the taping.

27:25.870 --> 27:27.270
(sets key on sink)

27:27.272 --> 27:28.871
(turns on faucet)

27:35.246 --> 27:37.714
Bitch, when's the last time
you saw a dermatologist?

27:39.384 --> 27:42.285
Okay, you are
obviously trippin'.
What do you want?

27:42.287 --> 27:43.987
(deep voice):
Blood.

27:46.791 --> 27:48.558
(gasping)

27:48.560 --> 27:50.259
(laughs quietly)

27:50.261 --> 27:53.129
Yeah, you clearly don't know
who you're messing with.

27:54.099 --> 27:55.798
(gasps)

27:55.800 --> 27:57.233
(grunts)

27:57.235 --> 27:58.267
(gasps)

27:58.269 --> 27:59.268
That's right--

27:59.270 --> 28:00.970
I'm a human
voodoo doll, bitch.

28:00.972 --> 28:03.606
Any hurt on me gonna go
right back to you!

28:03.608 --> 28:06.275
You're a damn witch!

28:06.277 --> 28:08.511
Witch's blood
will make me strong.

28:08.513 --> 28:10.780
I ain't nobody's
protein shake, bitch!

28:10.782 --> 28:12.915
(screams, gasps)

28:14.786 --> 28:17.120
(gasps, yells)

28:17.122 --> 28:18.988
(grunting, gasping)

28:24.029 --> 28:25.094
That's all you got?

28:26.264 --> 28:28.131
Nothing?

28:28.133 --> 28:29.666
(panting)

28:29.668 --> 28:33.036
I'm not letting
some raggedy-ass,

28:33.038 --> 28:35.004
red-dotted, blood-whore freak

28:35.006 --> 28:37.173
take up another
second of my time.

28:37.175 --> 28:39.242
It's my vacation, bitch!

28:40.278 --> 28:41.711
<i> The Price Is Right</i> is waitin'.

28:41.713 --> 28:42.945
Come on down!

28:42.947 --> 28:45.214
(yells)
(gasps)

28:45.216 --> 28:46.883
Why aren't you... (gasps)

28:48.787 --> 28:50.453
Your magic has
nowhere to go, my dear.

28:50.455 --> 28:53.389
You see, I'm not alive.

28:54.159 --> 28:55.491
You may be a witch...

28:55.493 --> 28:57.026
(Ramona grunts, growls)

28:57.028 --> 28:58.461
...but I am a ghost.

28:59.531 --> 29:00.897
(sighs)

29:00.899 --> 29:02.565
Ooh.

29:02.567 --> 29:04.901
A shame she had to die.

29:04.903 --> 29:06.169
(chomping, sucking)

29:06.171 --> 29:09.472
This one had a flair
for the dark arts.

29:09.474 --> 29:11.974
(gasping)

29:13.378 --> 29:16.179
Who the hell are you?

29:16.181 --> 29:17.947
James Patrick March.

29:20.151 --> 29:22.652
You saved me for a reason.

29:22.654 --> 29:25.388
I need you to kill the Countess.

29:25.390 --> 29:28.324
Looks to me
you qualify for the job.

29:28.326 --> 29:32.161
And ruin my one chance
for happiness? Oh, no.

29:32.163 --> 29:35.998
She must die in this hotel,
but she can't suspect I had
anything to do with it.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.600
You're the only one
strong enough.

29:37.602 --> 29:40.403
Then she'll be bound
to the Cortez.

29:40.405 --> 29:42.438
She's on the verge
of absconding forever,

29:42.440 --> 29:44.373
and I will not allow it.

29:44.375 --> 29:46.609
Drink up, darling.

29:46.611 --> 29:49.178
You're going to need
your strength.

29:52.550 --> 29:53.983
(growls quietly)

30:12.103 --> 30:13.536
(muffled grunting)

30:13.538 --> 30:14.771
Do you swear you haven't taken

30:14.773 --> 30:16.239
any drugs in the last 30 days?

30:16.241 --> 30:17.240
(muffled grunting)

30:17.242 --> 30:18.775
I'm a cop.
I can test you.

30:18.777 --> 30:20.076
Do I have to test you?

30:20.078 --> 30:22.779
(muffled grunting)

30:33.057 --> 30:35.391
Alex?

30:36.828 --> 30:38.728
Hello?

30:46.337 --> 30:49.071
Alex?

30:50.074 --> 30:52.074
Scarlett?

31:09.327 --> 31:11.727
¶ ¶

31:19.170 --> 31:21.237
(keys jingle, lock clicks)

31:28.112 --> 31:30.112
Hello, John.

31:30.114 --> 31:31.781
You?

31:31.783 --> 31:33.983
What'd you do with my family?

31:33.985 --> 31:35.551
(chuckles):
I didn't do anything.

31:35.553 --> 31:38.287
You know I'm trapped here.

31:38.289 --> 31:40.790
And you want
nothing more...

31:40.792 --> 31:42.959
than for me to be
trapped here with you.

31:42.961 --> 31:45.895
Well, that's right.

31:45.897 --> 31:48.698
And I would've taken a hammer
to the back of your head

31:48.700 --> 31:50.066
the second
you walked in, but...

31:50.068 --> 31:52.735
he wouldn't let me.

31:54.739 --> 31:57.506
March-- are you saying
he took my family?

31:57.508 --> 32:00.042
You made him
a promise, John.

32:00.044 --> 32:02.044
Where are they?
One last kill,

32:02.046 --> 32:05.047
and then
I can take you to your family.

32:06.584 --> 32:07.650
They're safe.

32:10.355 --> 32:11.754
For now.

32:13.324 --> 32:15.524
He's never gonna leave me alone

32:15.526 --> 32:17.660
until I give him what he wants.

32:17.662 --> 32:20.930
"Thou shalt not commit murder."

32:20.932 --> 32:22.999
That's all that's left.

32:24.002 --> 32:26.168
I need to find a murderer.

32:27.672 --> 32:30.740
Well, that shouldn't be
too difficult.

32:36.281 --> 32:38.281
LIZ:
Oh.

32:38.283 --> 32:41.050
Damn...!

32:41.052 --> 32:42.885
I hate it when a woman

32:42.887 --> 32:45.554
looks better in one of
my outfits than I do.

32:45.556 --> 32:47.757
(chuckles):
I know, I<i> know.</i>

32:47.759 --> 32:49.292
I ought to be
in pictures,

32:49.294 --> 32:51.594
'cept I can't be photographed.

32:51.596 --> 32:52.895
Anyways...

32:52.897 --> 32:56.532
we have some
accessories for you.

32:56.534 --> 32:57.967
(chuckles)
I don't need

32:57.969 --> 32:59.235
any of that.

32:59.237 --> 33:01.570
I got witch's blood
in my veins.

33:01.572 --> 33:04.040
Plus, a golden opportunity.

33:04.042 --> 33:06.542
The Countess has never
been more vulnerable.

33:06.544 --> 33:09.312
I don't need any
convincing, sisters.

33:09.314 --> 33:12.248
It's time... for me to rise

33:12.250 --> 33:13.816
and her...

33:13.818 --> 33:15.451
to fall.

33:38.743 --> 33:40.242
(grunts)

33:49.520 --> 33:51.988
(liquid pouring)

34:03.368 --> 34:06.602
It's not the Shalimar
that gives you away.

34:10.041 --> 34:11.374
It's your blood.

34:12.877 --> 34:14.677
I've never known another woman

34:14.679 --> 34:17.213
whose blood smelled
like walnuts.

34:17.215 --> 34:20.850
Yours still smells
like black licorice.

34:20.852 --> 34:23.786
You look incredible.

34:23.788 --> 34:25.354
What have you been eating?

34:25.356 --> 34:27.823
I just had me a witch.

34:27.825 --> 34:29.525
Really?

34:29.527 --> 34:35.464
I feel like grizzly bears
are running through my veins.

34:35.466 --> 34:37.867
I feel strong.

34:37.869 --> 34:40.669
Strong enough
to take me down?

34:40.671 --> 34:43.406
(chuckles)

34:43.408 --> 34:46.742
I could have Yogi Bear
running though my veins

34:46.744 --> 34:48.577
and I could take you down.

34:48.579 --> 34:51.414
And I imagine that locking you
up in that hallway hasn't

34:51.416 --> 34:53.749
softened your rage towards me.

34:53.751 --> 34:57.586
I fantasized about coming here
and ending you

34:57.588 --> 34:59.355
every day.

34:59.357 --> 35:01.424
And what did you settle on?

35:01.426 --> 35:04.727
You always
did like to...

35:04.729 --> 35:05.995
take your time.

35:05.997 --> 35:07.663
I haven't decided yet.

35:07.665 --> 35:09.398
I've never been one
to plan.

35:09.400 --> 35:12.268
I prefer improvisation.

35:13.204 --> 35:17.673
I'm weak, but I'm
still the champ.

35:17.675 --> 35:19.775
You may beat me,

35:19.777 --> 35:21.544
but you're not getting out
of here without

35:21.546 --> 35:23.612
at least
a severe, lifelong limp.

35:23.614 --> 35:25.648
You're bullshitting me?

35:27.785 --> 35:29.885
I think everyone
in the world thinks

35:29.887 --> 35:31.787
they're either blessed
or cursed.

35:34.625 --> 35:35.724
(scoffing laugh)

35:35.726 --> 35:37.993
I've come to realize
that I'm neither.

35:41.732 --> 35:44.533
I am a curse.

35:44.535 --> 35:47.970
Nobody that gets within
ten feet of me survives.

35:49.974 --> 35:53.142
And God help you
if you get

35:53.144 --> 35:55.144
right up close, skin to skin.

35:55.146 --> 35:57.146
Then you're really screwed.

35:57.148 --> 35:59.448
You're trying
to make me feel sorry for you?

35:59.450 --> 36:01.217
I'm trying to apologize.

36:02.286 --> 36:03.385
(exhales)

36:03.387 --> 36:04.887
I'm not used to this.

36:04.889 --> 36:07.156
Cut me some slack, bitch.

36:13.631 --> 36:16.432
What if I gave you the hotel?

36:16.434 --> 36:20.669
Hah. Severance pay
for 20 years of hell?

36:20.671 --> 36:24.974
I liked staying here
because it made me feel safe.

36:26.944 --> 36:30.346
But I see now that it's just
because I was so comfortable

36:30.348 --> 36:33.115
living in heartbreak.

36:33.117 --> 36:35.351
I don't want to be here anymore.

36:39.790 --> 36:41.290
It's harder to kill you

36:41.292 --> 36:43.459
when I'm sitting
in the same room as you.

36:43.461 --> 36:47.630
Easier to carve your heart out
of your chest and eat it

36:47.632 --> 36:50.599
when you're just a monster
in my mind.

36:50.601 --> 36:53.435
That sounds
like a dream way to die.

36:53.437 --> 36:55.504
So erotic.

37:09.220 --> 37:11.554
I want to go.

37:11.556 --> 37:14.123
Just me
and my baby boy.

37:16.060 --> 37:18.394
Okay... kill me.

37:20.364 --> 37:22.164
But screw me first.

37:22.166 --> 37:24.266
¶ You adore me ¶

37:25.803 --> 37:28.737
¶ You adore me ¶

37:29.807 --> 37:31.640
¶ You adore me ¶

37:31.642 --> 37:35.844
¶ I wanna, I wanna,
I wanna be adored ¶

37:35.846 --> 37:39.848
¶ I wanna,
I wanna, I wanna be adored ¶

37:39.850 --> 37:44.153
¶ I wanna, I wanna,
I wanna be adored ¶

37:44.155 --> 37:46.021
¶ I wanna, I wanna ¶

37:46.023 --> 37:48.991
(elevator bell dings)
¶ I gotta be adored... ¶

38:00.404 --> 38:02.471
¶ ¶

38:07.044 --> 38:10.246
¶ I wanna be adored. ¶

38:22.927 --> 38:25.928
Give yourself a smile, John.

38:25.930 --> 38:27.563
Ten Commandments.

38:27.565 --> 38:30.099
Each victim a worthy
representative of their sin.

38:30.101 --> 38:34.370
And the last one:
Thou shalt not commit murder.

38:34.372 --> 38:36.772
I suppose you or I could
be sitting on that shelf,

38:36.774 --> 38:39.708
but your choice was inspired.

38:39.710 --> 38:43.412
Couldn't have worked out
any better if I had
planned it myself.

38:43.414 --> 38:46.115
Aren't you proud
of our boy, Sally?

38:46.117 --> 38:48.284
I always knew
he was the one.

38:48.286 --> 38:51.053
How do you feel, John?

38:51.055 --> 38:53.389
It must be exhilarating.
Yeah.

38:53.391 --> 38:55.291
MARCH: A true sense
of completeness.

38:55.293 --> 38:57.259
I'm completely done.

38:57.261 --> 38:59.662
MARCH: No!
(grunting)

38:59.664 --> 39:02.298
MARCH: No!
He belongs with me!

39:02.300 --> 39:04.233
No! I need him alive.
Out in the world.

39:04.235 --> 39:06.268
There's more at stake here
than your womanly desires.

39:06.270 --> 39:07.970
I have great plans
for this one.

39:07.972 --> 39:09.938
(grunts)
Stop now before
my addiction demon

39:09.940 --> 39:11.240
becomes your
constant companion!

39:11.242 --> 39:12.641
No more plans.

39:12.643 --> 39:14.977
(panting)
Take me to my family.

39:14.979 --> 39:17.479
John... John!
Please!

39:32.196 --> 39:35.097
(sultry jazz playing)

39:37.101 --> 39:39.201
Do you remember
the first time, Miss Evers?

39:40.771 --> 39:45.507
When I had intimacies
with the opposite sex?

39:45.509 --> 39:47.876
The first time you realized
you were a ghost.

39:47.878 --> 39:53.015
Oh! Well, I was very
frightened and confused,

39:53.017 --> 39:55.284
but I had you to steady my hand.

39:55.286 --> 39:57.119
You were my rock, Mr. March.

39:57.121 --> 39:58.287
Yes, yes.

39:58.289 --> 40:00.889
The Countess
will be similarly unmoored.

40:00.891 --> 40:03.492
It's up to us
to provide that ballast.

40:03.494 --> 40:04.893
I want everything to be perfect.

40:04.895 --> 40:06.228
What's for dinner?

40:06.230 --> 40:07.896
Chipped beef on toast.

40:07.898 --> 40:10.366
To serve my queen?!

40:10.368 --> 40:12.034
This is an outrage!

40:12.036 --> 40:14.536
(doorbell rings)

40:27.084 --> 40:29.752
Darling, you look
ravishing. Come in.

40:29.754 --> 40:31.387
Take my hand.

40:31.389 --> 40:33.322
It'll take some time
to acclimate yourself

40:33.324 --> 40:35.624
to your new state.

40:36.594 --> 40:39.928
How do you feel?

40:39.930 --> 40:42.264
There's no pain but...

40:42.266 --> 40:44.867
no passion.

40:44.869 --> 40:46.869
No passion, no fire.

40:46.871 --> 40:49.037
The passion was
in front of your nose,

40:49.039 --> 40:51.640
if only you'd opened
your eyes to see it.

40:54.545 --> 40:56.945
At least I don't have
to spend an eternity

40:56.947 --> 40:59.281
as a pear-shaped frump.

40:59.283 --> 41:01.283
MARCH:
(chuckles) Well!

41:01.285 --> 41:05.053
Yes. Uh... you'll find

41:05.055 --> 41:07.556
some frustrations, no doubt,
as you adjust to the vicissitude

41:07.558 --> 41:10.025
of your new life.
The inability

41:10.027 --> 41:13.061
to step outside the confines
of this hotel, for one.

41:13.063 --> 41:16.465
But there is no profit
accentuating the limitations.

41:16.467 --> 41:19.268
On the balance, we are blessed.

41:19.270 --> 41:21.537
We are together again,
my love.

41:21.539 --> 41:23.605
That one fact erases
a multitude of sins.

41:23.607 --> 41:28.010
I can finally forgive you for
turning me in to the police.

41:28.979 --> 41:31.146
I didn't turn you in.

41:33.050 --> 41:36.385
There is no need for any
further prevarication, darling.

41:36.387 --> 41:39.455
We are reduced
to our essence.

41:40.391 --> 41:42.925
I'm not lying.

41:42.927 --> 41:44.293
If I wanted you dead,

41:44.295 --> 41:46.562
I would have killed you myself.

41:50.668 --> 41:52.501
Then who?

41:52.503 --> 41:54.369
MS. EVERS:
You should've left!

41:55.973 --> 41:57.973
Why didn't you leave?!

41:57.975 --> 42:00.309
I knew
you would eventually get bored.

42:00.311 --> 42:03.312
Why did you have
to die here?

42:03.314 --> 42:05.581
It was me.
I did it!

42:05.583 --> 42:07.316
I wanted you
for myself!

42:07.318 --> 42:10.319
I left the handkerchief
for the police.

42:10.321 --> 42:12.120
I knew that they would come,

42:12.122 --> 42:15.491
and I knew that you would never
allow yourself to be captured.

42:16.927 --> 42:21.730
I wanted us to die together.

42:23.767 --> 42:28.904
So that you can see
the depth of my devotion.

42:30.140 --> 42:33.809
While this one
resented every moment

42:33.811 --> 42:36.712
she was obligated
to be in your presence.

42:36.714 --> 42:40.115
I would happily
stand behind you,

42:40.117 --> 42:42.017
waiting to serve,

42:42.019 --> 42:44.453
savoring your
every word.

42:44.455 --> 42:48.790
Have you seen no evidence
of my love?

42:52.363 --> 42:55.998
Do you feel nothing at all?

42:56.000 --> 42:59.268
Can you see me now?

43:00.204 --> 43:04.473
I have laid myself bare.

43:04.475 --> 43:08.343
I've dwelt in silence
for so long.

43:08.345 --> 43:10.345
Give me a word, Mr. March.

43:10.347 --> 43:13.448
Let me be happy.

43:29.500 --> 43:31.567
Get out.

43:36.340 --> 43:37.773
You...

43:37.775 --> 43:40.642
are banished from my presence.

43:51.055 --> 43:54.790
I-I feel...
(shuddering breath)

43:54.792 --> 43:56.725
strangely free.

43:56.727 --> 43:58.594
(sniffles)

44:02.933 --> 44:05.233
(low groan)

44:05.235 --> 44:08.537
I will no longer wait on you...

44:09.907 --> 44:11.907
...and your whore.

44:11.909 --> 44:15.143
COUNTESS:
You have nothing.

44:15.145 --> 44:16.278
What else would you

44:16.280 --> 44:18.113
possibly do?

44:19.750 --> 44:23.151
There are more stains
in heaven and earth

44:23.153 --> 44:27.489
than are dreamt of
in your philosophy.

44:37.434 --> 44:39.668
(door opens)

44:41.639 --> 44:43.338
(door shuts)

44:54.852 --> 44:56.885
Mm.

45:11.201 --> 45:12.901
A toast.

45:15.639 --> 45:18.774
How thrilled I am
to have you across from me.

45:18.776 --> 45:22.010
Not once a month,
but from now on.

45:25.816 --> 45:29.217
Until the sun falls from the sky

45:29.219 --> 45:33.121
and the heavens burn
in conflagration.

45:39.897 --> 45:41.196
(exhales)

45:45.369 --> 45:47.436
