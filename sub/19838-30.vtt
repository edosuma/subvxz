00:02.670 --> 00:04.150
<b>I never knew</b>

00:05.390 --> 00:07.260
<b>how frustrating</b>

00:08.260 --> 00:09.980
<b>weakness could be!</b>

00:14.590 --> 00:15.570
<b><i>Gon...</i></b>

00:17.480 --> 00:20.130
<b><i>For the thirty days that you can't use</i> Nen...</b>

00:21.690 --> 00:23.480
<b><i>I'll protect you.</i></b>

00:24.140 --> 00:27.290
<b><i>I will do whatever it takes!</i></b>

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
<b>One Wish x And x Two Promises</b>

01:55.960 --> 02:00.700
<b>Colt arrived, under a white flag of 
surrender, to ask the Hunters a favor.</b>

02:01.130 --> 02:05.470
<b>His wish was that they save the dying Queen.</b>

02:06.000 --> 02:11.150
<b>After hearing his request, Morel and 
Knov took Colt to see Netero.</b>

02:12.740 --> 02:13.930
<b>It's me.</b>

02:13.930 --> 02:18.420
<b>Send over a team of Chimera Ant 
researchers immediately.</b>

02:19.870 --> 02:20.760
<b>Hmm?</b>

02:21.220 --> 02:22.660
<b>The king has been born.</b>

02:23.790 --> 02:26.710
<b>Contact Dr. Lee, of the Bonrin Medical School,</b>

02:26.710 --> 02:29.320
<b>and have him bring all</b>

02:29.320 --> 02:33.260
<b>his skilled surgeons and artificial organ experts.</b>

02:37.860 --> 02:40.200
<b>We leave in four hours.</b>

02:40.200 --> 02:41.130
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

02:49.950 --> 02:53.490
<b>We will do everything we can.</b>

02:55.280 --> 02:56.370
<b>Colt-kun...</b>

02:58.410 --> 03:01.320
<b>We'll need your cooperation.</b>

03:08.750 --> 03:13.080
<b>Heart</b>

03:09.760 --> 03:12.770
<b>This may be the last time I wear this...</b>

03:13.080 --> 03:15.250
<b>Hey, is that...</b>

03:15.250 --> 03:18.340
<b>Yes, it's his "heart" T-shirt.</b>

03:18.340 --> 03:22.510
<b>Heart</b>

03:18.980 --> 03:23.980
<b>They say it's a lucky shirt he only 
wears when he fights for real.</b>

03:25.890 --> 03:28.180
<b>But I always thought it was a just a rumor...</b>

03:28.920 --> 03:33.240
<b>Colt-kun, it appears that you can use <i>Nen</i>...</b>

03:39.300 --> 03:43.010
<b>Since you've been in the King's presence,</b>

03:43.010 --> 03:45.950
<b>I want you to give me your honest opinion.</b>

03:47.280 --> 03:50.830
<b>How do I compare to the King?</b>

03:51.870 --> 03:53.430
<b><i>He really is special...</i></b>

03:53.870 --> 03:57.860
<b><i>It feels like needles pricking 
me all over my body.</i></b>

04:00.720 --> 04:01.900
<b>Most likely,</b>

04:02.680 --> 04:05.010
<b>you will be unable to lay a finger on him.</b>

04:06.330 --> 04:08.130
<b>You'll be killed by one of his Royal Guard</b>

04:08.660 --> 04:10.820
<b>before you can get close enough.</b>

04:14.650 --> 04:15.870
<b>I see...</b>

04:16.600 --> 04:18.520
<b>I'm happy to hear that.</b>

04:19.420 --> 04:22.000
<b>At this age, I'll be a challenger.</b>

04:22.430 --> 04:24.580
<b>This is exciting stuff.</b>

04:29.150 --> 04:33.350
<b>Morel, I believe your disciples 
were to fight today, yes?</b>

04:33.780 --> 04:34.720
<b>Yes.</b>

04:34.720 --> 04:38.100
<b>Take the victors and the research team,</b>

04:38.100 --> 04:40.800
<b>along with Colt, to the nest.</b>

04:41.120 --> 04:42.220
<b>And you, Chairman?</b>

04:42.220 --> 04:44.460
<b>You don't plan to pursue the King alone?</b>

04:44.460 --> 04:45.550
<b>Oh, no...</b>

04:46.170 --> 04:49.290
<b>I'm off to see an old acquaintance.</b>

05:05.060 --> 05:07.570
<b>Don't forget to pay me my one million.</b>

05:07.890 --> 05:09.630
<b>I know.</b>

05:09.630 --> 05:11.800
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

05:11.800 --> 05:13.110
<b>Nothing important.</b>

05:13.610 --> 05:14.660
<b>Let's go.</b>

05:14.660 --> 05:15.680
<b>Yeah.</b>

05:18.680 --> 05:21.590
<b>Everyone else has left.</b>

05:21.940 --> 05:26.720
<b>Most of our soldiers joined 
other squadrons and left.</b>

05:27.250 --> 05:32.600
<b>Though a few oddballs did leave 
their squadrons to stay here.</b>

05:32.960 --> 05:37.140
<b>I suppose it's fortunate no fighting broke out.</b>

05:40.440 --> 05:43.070
<b>Did you stop the bleeding?</b>

05:43.070 --> 05:47.360
<b>Yes, but I couldn't do anything else for her.</b>

05:47.620 --> 05:51.620
<b>I'm not sure we can, either. 
Don't expect too much.</b>

05:52.150 --> 05:55.870
<b>For now, we'll hook her up to artificial organs.</b>

05:56.600 --> 05:58.470
<b>Can you use my organs?</b>

05:58.470 --> 06:00.630
<b>You can have all my blood, as well!</b>

06:02.340 --> 06:03.920
<b>Unfortunately, it won't work.</b>

06:04.800 --> 06:08.630
<b>Chimera Ants from different generations 
are completely different organisms.</b>

06:08.970 --> 06:14.640
<b>Just look at how much the Chimera 
Ants in your own generation vary.</b>

06:16.190 --> 06:18.140
<b>But the sentiment is appreciated.</b>

06:18.370 --> 06:20.400
<b>We'll do our best, so pray...</b>

06:23.150 --> 06:27.060
<b>That, miraculously, all the organs will function.</b>

06:55.030 --> 06:56.200
<b><i>Pray...</i></b>

06:56.700 --> 07:00.040
<b><i>Is that all I can do?</i></b>

07:01.950 --> 07:03.440
<b>Someone...</b>

07:05.040 --> 07:07.060
<b>Is anyone there?</b>

07:08.560 --> 07:11.060
<b>Yes, I am by your side!</b>

07:11.060 --> 07:13.070
<b>Please give me your command!</b>

07:13.070 --> 07:14.020
<b>What is it?</b>

07:14.670 --> 07:15.690
<b>Telepathy?</b>

07:15.690 --> 07:16.580
<b>Yes,</b>

07:16.850 --> 07:20.430
<b>the Queen cannot speak as we do.</b>

07:20.430 --> 07:21.840
<b>Can you tell us what she's saying?</b>

07:22.580 --> 07:25.590
<b>Perhaps she has a hint for saving her life.</b>

07:27.180 --> 07:28.620
<b>My son...</b>

07:29.270 --> 07:34.090
<b>Is my son all right?</b>

07:35.520 --> 07:40.400
<b>Did he have any defects?</b>

07:40.400 --> 07:41.780
<b>...defects?</b>

07:46.390 --> 07:48.670
<b>You have nothing to worry about.</b>

07:48.670 --> 07:50.610
<b>He is perfectly healthy, and right now...</b>

07:51.030 --> 07:55.530
<b>And right now, he's taken 
the Royal Guard to search</b>

07:55.530 --> 07:56.810
<b>for medicine to help you.</b>

07:56.810 --> 07:58.510
<b>...to help you.</b>

08:00.930 --> 08:04.390
<b>The truth is that, after he killed 
and ate Squadron Leaders,</b>

08:04.390 --> 08:07.130
<b>he left in search of a new territory.</b>

08:07.130 --> 08:09.730
<b>I doubt he will return.</b>

08:09.730 --> 08:11.050
<b>He ate them?</b>

08:11.050 --> 08:11.880
<b>The King</b>

08:12.560 --> 08:17.000
<b>has no concern for the Queen's health!</b>

08:18.440 --> 08:22.680
<b>Then, the King is safe?</b>

08:23.280 --> 08:24.400
<b>Yes.</b>

08:26.270 --> 08:27.950
<b>That is wonderful...</b>

08:30.400 --> 08:31.650
<b>Oh, no.</b>

08:32.300 --> 08:36.340
<b>Send the King off at once.</b>

08:39.780 --> 08:45.870
<b>There is no time to waste on my well-being...</b>

08:47.670 --> 08:53.170
<b>My son has the potential to rule the world.</b>

08:56.430 --> 08:58.810
<b>He was born too early,</b>

08:59.730 --> 09:02.460
<b>so I was very worried.</b>

09:03.480 --> 09:06.900
<b>However, it appears...</b>

09:07.240 --> 09:10.040
<b>I have fulfilled my duty...</b>

09:16.290 --> 09:19.530
<b>That was all I wanted.</b>

09:19.530 --> 09:21.160
<b>What are you saying?!</b>

09:21.420 --> 09:24.590
<b>You are our guiding light...</b>

09:24.590 --> 09:28.990
<b>Without you, the rest of us will 
lose our way and perish.</b>

09:31.680 --> 09:38.740
<b>I know my body better than anyone else...</b>

09:40.530 --> 09:44.020
<b>I will not last much longer.</b>

09:47.630 --> 09:51.540
<b>However, I have</b>

09:52.550 --> 09:53.760
<b>no regrets.</b>

09:53.760 --> 09:55.190
<b>Please stop!</b>

09:57.050 --> 09:59.200
<b>I beg you... Please live!</b>

10:00.010 --> 10:02.120
<b>Use my body! Please!</b>

10:02.590 --> 10:03.590
<b>Give it a shot!</b>

10:03.590 --> 10:05.700
<b>Until you try, you don't know it won't work!</b>

10:06.760 --> 10:07.810
<b>Listen...</b>

10:08.500 --> 10:11.710
<b>You must listen to what the Queen has to say.</b>

10:14.150 --> 10:20.570
<b>I have one last request...</b>

10:22.440 --> 10:25.410
<b>I thought of a name...</b>

10:26.420 --> 10:27.980
<b>for my son.</b>

10:28.730 --> 10:31.200
<b>For the King...</b>

10:32.460 --> 10:33.550
<b>A name?</b>

10:36.200 --> 10:37.930
<b>Meruem.</b>

10:40.230 --> 10:45.930
<b>It means the light that illuminates all.</b>

10:49.160 --> 10:53.840
<b>Deliver my message to him...</b>

10:57.820 --> 11:04.180
<b>My beloved son...</b>

11:23.210 --> 11:26.380
<b>I failed to protect her again...</b>

11:30.120 --> 11:34.360
<b>I can't protect anyone...</b>

11:39.120 --> 11:41.480
<b>Has something like this happened before?</b>

11:42.390 --> 11:45.350
<b>No, he's probably referring to a memory</b>

11:45.350 --> 11:46.810
<b>from when he was human.</b>

11:47.710 --> 11:51.160
<b>You have memories from 
when you were human?</b>

11:51.160 --> 11:55.310
<b>Of course, though naturally, some 
remember more than others...</b>

11:55.880 --> 11:57.670
<b>Our human personalities</b>

11:57.670 --> 12:00.160
<b>strongly influence our current behavior.</b>

12:01.070 --> 12:05.070
<b>And many can remember their human names.</b>

12:05.690 --> 12:09.510
<b>Otherwise, it wouldn't have been 
as easy to learn to speak.</b>

12:28.270 --> 12:28.990
<b>Hmm?</b>

12:29.740 --> 12:31.850
<b>Th-This is...</b>

12:35.820 --> 12:37.020
<b>There's...</b>

12:38.200 --> 12:40.180
<b>There's something moving!</b>

12:42.390 --> 12:43.470
<b>Don't touch it!</b>

12:45.090 --> 12:46.180
<b>I will...</b>

12:46.860 --> 12:48.260
<b>I will remove it.</b>

13:39.210 --> 13:42.980
<b>I shall protect this child...</b>

13:44.390 --> 13:45.430
<b>I swear it!</b>

13:46.720 --> 13:49.470
<b>This time, I won't fail...</b>

14:05.670 --> 14:06.720
<b>Morel?</b>

14:08.000 --> 14:09.020
<b>Colt...</b>

14:09.560 --> 14:11.330
<b>Can you promise me</b>

14:11.770 --> 14:14.260
<b>that you and that child 
will never eat humans?</b>

14:19.940 --> 14:22.650
<b>If you can't make that promise,</b>

14:23.300 --> 14:26.950
<b>you should get out of my sight immediately.</b>

14:28.790 --> 14:31.850
<b>But if you're willing to give your word...</b>

14:36.180 --> 14:41.330
<b>No one will ever lay a finger on you,</b>

14:41.330 --> 14:44.110
<b>not as long as I'm around.</b>

14:45.740 --> 14:47.500
<b>You have my promise!</b>

14:54.660 --> 14:56.620
<b>It isn't a big deal...</b>

14:56.870 --> 15:02.140
<b>I inherited my soft nature from my master.</b>

16:01.250 --> 16:03.310
<b>Okay, I've recovered!</b>

16:03.560 --> 16:07.250
<b>Knuckle and the other Hunters will save Kite.</b>

16:07.660 --> 16:10.570
<b>So I have to become stronger!</b>

16:11.300 --> 16:14.820
<b>So that Kite won't be disappointed 
when he comes back.</b>

16:16.820 --> 16:20.330
<b>Ah, so you do understand.</b>

16:21.520 --> 16:24.010
<b>You may have met Kite before we did,</b>

16:24.010 --> 16:27.560
<b>but we've spent more time with him.</b>

16:29.810 --> 16:34.340
<b>After we crossed the mountains, if you'd still 
been moping, I would've given you a beating...</b>

16:36.040 --> 16:39.820
<b>And told you that Kite wouldn't 
want to see you two like this.</b>

16:41.260 --> 16:43.240
<b>I know he's still alive,</b>

16:43.710 --> 16:46.860
<b>and he doesn't want you to have regrets.</b>

16:47.870 --> 16:50.000
<b>Right now, what should you do?</b>

16:50.760 --> 16:54.520
<b>You must make the correct decision, 
and find the will to follow through!</b>

16:55.550 --> 16:57.850
<b>If you're too weak, train more.</b>

16:57.850 --> 17:01.120
<b>There's enough space here 
for squats and push-ups.</b>

17:02.250 --> 17:04.070
<b>Yeah, you're right.</b>

17:08.630 --> 17:10.020
<b>Hey, Spin...</b>

17:10.480 --> 17:11.380
<b>Hmm?</b>

17:12.380 --> 17:14.430
<b>Why do you want to be a Hunter?</b>

17:16.410 --> 17:20.260
<b>I need the money to repay a huge debt.</b>

17:23.350 --> 17:25.340
<b>Have you heard of the small-billed swan?</b>

17:25.340 --> 17:26.270
<b>Nope...</b>

17:27.240 --> 17:30.550
<b>It's a species of bird that can only live 
in the area around a certain mine.</b>

17:31.210 --> 17:34.420
<b>No one knows why that is.</b>

17:34.780 --> 17:38.280
<b>Is it the water? The food? The weather?</b>

17:40.260 --> 17:44.090
<b>So I bought the entire area where the mine is.</b>

17:46.030 --> 17:49.690
<b>Well, the mine's closed down now.</b>

17:51.490 --> 17:53.870
<b>Kite provided the money for that.</b>

17:54.200 --> 17:58.570
<b>He was the first adult who was willing to listen</b>

17:58.570 --> 18:01.920
<b>to kids who had nothing at all.</b>

18:05.320 --> 18:09.620
<b>Stinn and I were born in that area.</b>

18:19.370 --> 18:24.720
<b>The sight of thousands of small-billed swans taking 
flight with the light of dawn at their backs...</b>

18:25.500 --> 18:32.990
<b>That's the oldest, but strongest, 
memory Stinn and I have.</b>

18:36.770 --> 18:40.520
<b>When we heard the area would be demolished,</b>

18:41.220 --> 18:45.060
<b>we realized how important it was to us...</b>

18:46.600 --> 18:49.850
<b>Kite said that he envied us.</b>

18:51.080 --> 18:53.140
<b>He doesn't have a home.</b>

18:53.140 --> 18:55.860
<b>Because he doesn't know where he was born.</b>

18:59.720 --> 19:04.370
<b>Once this mission is over, 
I can show you two</b>

19:06.750 --> 19:08.470
<b>my treasure.</b>

19:58.490 --> 20:00.760
<b>Th-This is...</b>

20:22.540 --> 20:24.240
<b>Goal!</b>

20:27.070 --> 20:30.540
<b><i>I am the Speed King.</i></b>

20:30.940 --> 20:34.250
<b><i>No one can stop me!</i></b>

20:39.430 --> 20:44.490
<b>Given Cheetu's speed, he's probably 
already crossed the border.</b>

20:45.960 --> 20:48.800
<b>Well, I'll take my time searching...</b>

20:50.540 --> 20:55.560
<b>For my own paradise, 
with plenty of food and females.</b>

20:56.690 --> 21:01.260
<b><i>Cows, pigs, humans, boars, bears...</i></b>

21:01.880 --> 21:05.000
<b><i>I'll take any of those if they're plentiful.</i></b>

21:05.530 --> 21:09.770
<b><i>Because I am the Glutton King.</i></b>

21:13.250 --> 21:16.390
<b>The Chimera Ants that were once soldiers</b>

21:17.400 --> 21:20.760
<b>have now departed to become kings.</b>

21:35.060 --> 21:37.230
<b>Meanwhile, the King</b>

21:38.030 --> 21:41.140
<b>is now in the Republic of East Gorteau.</b>

23:24.640 --> 23:26.830
<b>Next time: Date x With x Palm.</b>

23:26.830 --> 23:28.070
<b>A date! A date!</b>

23:28.070 --> 23:30.370
<b>Gon, do you understand what a date is?</b>

23:30.370 --> 23:31.400
<b>Huh? Sure.</b>

23:31.400 --> 23:32.960
<b>It's when a man and woman—</b>

23:32.960 --> 23:34.450
<b>Th-Th-That's enough!</b>
