00:01.134 --> 00:02.897
Previously on Eli Stone:

00:02.969 --> 00:05.733
You know Marci Klein,
as in Wethersby, Posner and...

00:05.839 --> 00:09.206
The fear is that Mr. Stone
is symptomatic of a larger problem.

00:09.275 --> 00:12.301
- A string of client defections.
- You know Le Petite Table?

00:12.379 --> 00:15.348
Six-month waiting list.
That Le Petite Table?

00:15.415 --> 00:17.576
Get a reservation,
I'll have dinner with you.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.618
You never mentioned Scott
before you got engaged.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.347
Well, you knew I had a boyfriend.

00:21.421 --> 00:24.720
You have to admit the engagement thing
kinda came out of nowhere.

00:24.791 --> 00:26.759
Taylor, do you feel that?

00:26.860 --> 00:30.523
I saw an earthquake
and it destroys Silver Terrace.

00:35.368 --> 00:36.835
Mr. Stone?

00:36.903 --> 00:40.031
- Mr. Stone, please, sit down.
- Cool fish.

00:40.974 --> 00:43.135
Your pre-op exam looks promising.

00:43.209 --> 00:46.701
Well, I studied very hard.
That's a joke.

00:46.780 --> 00:51.114
Vitals look good, blood pressure
is normal, heart is healthy.

00:51.184 --> 00:52.913
It looks like we're all set.

00:52.986 --> 00:54.886
To take out the aneurysm.

00:54.954 --> 00:58.412
I thought we were removing
your gallbladder.

00:58.491 --> 01:00.857
A little joke.

01:00.960 --> 01:03.895
- You seem nervous.
- Why would I be nervous?

01:03.963 --> 01:08.093
It's not like we're talking about going
into my skull with sharp instruments

01:08.168 --> 01:11.399
with a high likelihood
that I'll lose the ability to speak.

01:11.471 --> 01:14.929
That's if I don't
lose the ability to, you know, live.

01:15.008 --> 01:17.135
Given the risk, in these circumstances

01:17.210 --> 01:20.475
I recommend that patients
should get their affairs in order.

01:20.547 --> 01:23.072
- You saying I should draft a will?
- A living will.

01:23.149 --> 01:25.083
A document that clarifies your wishes

01:25.151 --> 01:27.449
should you be unable
to express them yourself.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.580
I'm sure you know a few good lawyers.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.526
Yo, taxi!

01:38.298 --> 01:40.858
Jerk. Taxi!

01:42.335 --> 01:44.701
Hi, 101 Federal Street, downtown.

01:45.672 --> 01:48.232
...clear with lightly scattered clouds.

01:48.341 --> 01:50.309
Temperatures in the mid to high 60's.

01:50.376 --> 01:52.810
Lows tonight dropping down
into the mid 40's.

01:52.879 --> 01:55.712
All in all, a beautiful day
here in our great city.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.340
I am almost there, Macaroni.

01:57.417 --> 01:59.851
I am on the Golden Gate Bridge
right now.

02:00.820 --> 02:04.779
- Yes, that's the big orangey one.
- Golden Gate? I said downtown.

02:04.858 --> 02:07.224
Hello? Hello?

02:08.261 --> 02:10.525
Oh, great. A vision.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.258
See you soon, Macaroni.

02:13.333 --> 02:17.269
It's Thursday, the 24th.
The time is now 5:13.

02:17.337 --> 02:20.500
No, it's not. It's Monday, the 21 st
and it's ten in the morning.

02:20.573 --> 02:22.803
Oh, God, not again.

02:31.084 --> 02:34.645
Hey, buddy,
I said, "Where are you going?"

02:34.754 --> 02:38.918
- ... heavy getting off the lower deck...
- Chinatown. I'm going to Chinatown.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.017
The Golden Gate Bridge is at the limit.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.823
And stay off the Golden Gate.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.867
As if one fake earthquake
hallucination wasn't enough,

02:47.967 --> 02:51.835
I'm getting one directed by Michael Bay.
It's like the aneurysm knows.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.668
It knows I'm trying to take it out,

02:53.773 --> 02:56.708
and it's trying to scare me
with big budget sequels.

02:56.776 --> 02:59.472
Personifying your aneurysm?
That's kind of weird.

02:59.546 --> 03:04.449
It's like, Jonah. God kept
talking to him when he didn't believe.

03:04.517 --> 03:08.078
Yeah. I've been reading up.
Big storm, swallowed by a fish.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.282
You want to get all Trivial Pursuit?
Bring it.

03:11.357 --> 03:14.224
Jonah still was a prophet,
albeit a stubborn one.

03:14.294 --> 03:16.262
You're kind of making my point for me.

03:16.362 --> 03:17.659
I saw when it happens.

03:18.898 --> 03:23.164
- When the earthquake hits?
- Three days time, 5:13pm.

03:24.270 --> 03:26.830
- Eli, you have to tell people.
- Oh, I don't think so.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.908
You remember Silver Terrace?

03:28.975 --> 03:32.706
How I bribed a judge, had some families
kicked out of their homes...

03:32.779 --> 03:36.010
And what if this earthquake vision
is a validation of the first?

03:36.082 --> 03:38.983
Like Jonah hearing
the voice of God twice?

03:39.052 --> 03:40.417
I can't do anything.

03:40.486 --> 03:43.751
My super powers don't extend
to stopping earthquakes,

03:43.823 --> 03:47.452
and if I barely believe me,
who else is going to?

03:56.436 --> 03:59.599
Have Simon baby-sit Edwards
until you get back, Nigel.

03:59.672 --> 04:02.163
I need you on a plane
to San Francisco tonight.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.800
I am not asking.

04:03.876 --> 04:06.242
I see you've made yourself
right at home.

04:06.312 --> 04:08.940
I am at home, remember?

04:09.015 --> 04:11.575
We built this place together.

04:11.684 --> 04:13.652
Which makes it more disturbing to me

04:13.720 --> 04:16.587
to see you've been lobbying
for my ouster.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.089
My name's still the first one
on the door, Marci.

04:19.158 --> 04:20.921
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

04:21.027 --> 04:24.895
Truth be told,
I wasn't very concerned either way.

04:24.964 --> 04:28.923
I am more concerned about our top
corporate clients running for the door.

04:30.803 --> 04:33.101
There will be new clients,

04:33.172 --> 04:36.141
and even some of the former ones
will return to the fold.

04:36.209 --> 04:38.643
Not Beutel. Not Zyre Motors.

04:38.711 --> 04:42.613
They have their new attorneys
drafting malpractice complaints instead.

04:45.852 --> 04:48.821
You've spoken to their CEOs
without my prior approval?

04:52.925 --> 04:57.294
There's a common thread running through
the biggest blunders this firm has made.

04:57.363 --> 05:00.799
- Eli Stone isn't a blunder.
- I'd fire him, but he's protected.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.926
By an agreement you signed off on.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.938
I've done the math, Marci.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.166
You don't have the votes to replace me.

05:09.509 --> 05:10.874
Be sure of that.

05:15.014 --> 05:18.780
It's done. Cancel whatever plans
you have for Wednesday night

05:18.885 --> 05:21.251
because we are going to dinner.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.289
I highly doubt that.

05:23.389 --> 05:25.755
It might've been
chimp-induced psychosis,

05:25.858 --> 05:29.919
but I have a pretty accurate memory
of you offering to have dinner with me.

05:29.996 --> 05:33.727
If you got reservations at a restaurant
with a six month waiting list.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.529
Six months. That was a week ago.

05:35.601 --> 05:39.697
Suffice it to say, Le Petit Table
is now a client of this firm

05:39.772 --> 05:42.434
at a sharply discounted billing rate.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.874
Oh. Nice job, Mr. Dowd.

05:44.944 --> 05:47.412
I take it from
the look of surprise on your face

05:47.480 --> 05:51.246
you're unaccustomed to dealing with men
as capable as The Dowd.

05:54.587 --> 05:58.614
- Funny, we were just talking about you.
- Hey, uh, do you have a second?

05:58.691 --> 06:00.716
Uh, I've got at least 60 of them.

06:00.793 --> 06:03.887
Actually, I was asking "The Dowd. "

06:05.765 --> 06:08.859
What's on your
structurally defective mind, friend?

06:08.935 --> 06:12.166
- I need to schedule some time with you.
- Gee, that sounds swell,

06:12.238 --> 06:15.002
but my social calendar
is pretty full these days.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.474
It's not a personal matter,
it's a legal one.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.011
Actually, it's a personal legal matter.

06:20.079 --> 06:22.013
You're suing me for dating your ex.

06:22.081 --> 06:24.379
No, but what a nice thought.

06:24.450 --> 06:28.011
So, If you just let Patti know
when you've got some time free tomorrow.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.349
Thanks.

06:32.625 --> 06:35.093
Did you fall down
and hit your aneurysm?

06:35.161 --> 06:38.619
You should take a few days off.
Get out of town. Get far out of town.

06:38.698 --> 06:41.724
Go to a spa.
Just avoid the Golden Gate Bridge.

06:41.801 --> 06:43.928
I just got back from a week off.

06:44.003 --> 06:46.494
Take another week.
We're not particularly busy,

06:46.572 --> 06:49.541
- especially with my surgery coming up.
- Mm-hmm.

06:49.642 --> 06:51.803
- Patti, you shouldn't have.
- I didn't.

06:51.911 --> 06:55.677
- It is an engagement gift for Maggie.
- What'd I get her?

06:55.782 --> 06:58.273
An apology for being
such an ass last week.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.911
I used your credit card.
Here's the receipt.

07:01.888 --> 07:05.415
I'm either very sorry
or I am very happy for Maggie.

07:06.192 --> 07:07.625
You're both.

07:10.396 --> 07:13.297
It's for you.
For your engagement.

07:13.366 --> 07:16.062
This is very nice of you.
You didn't have to do this.

07:20.540 --> 07:23.304
Oh, it's beautiful.

07:23.376 --> 07:28.143
Well, I figured while Scott was in Ohio
he should also be on your desk.

07:28.214 --> 07:30.375
- In a frame.
- Actually, he'll be both.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.213
He's moving out here on Thursday.

07:33.486 --> 07:35.181
That's great.

07:35.254 --> 07:37.222
Wow. I can't wait to meet him.

07:41.494 --> 07:44.725
- Hello?
- Dude, I solved your problem.

07:44.797 --> 07:47.061
Sorry, you're gonna
have to tell me which one.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.101
Just turn on the TV. Channel eight.

07:49.168 --> 07:52.797
This is no fantasy.
No careless product of wild imagination.

07:52.872 --> 07:57.309
No, my friends, this is a matter
of undeniable scientific fact.

07:57.376 --> 07:59.936
- Are you watching? Do you see this?
- I see a nutcase

08:00.012 --> 08:02.640
with a handmade sign
and impeccable penmanship.

08:02.715 --> 08:06.583
You wanted to tell everyone about
the earthquake so they'd believe you?

08:06.652 --> 08:09.416
Listen to this guy. He's a scientist.

08:09.489 --> 08:13.448
I've calculated that the quake
will hit in three days time. Thursday.

08:13.526 --> 08:14.891
Did you hear that?

08:14.961 --> 08:17.657
You said in your vision
the earthquake hit Thursday.

08:17.730 --> 08:19.027
Thursday.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.771
You know you didn't have to chaperone.

08:29.842 --> 08:32.402
I'm not. I'm making sure
you don't blow this off.

08:32.477 --> 08:35.379
By "this" you mean your plan
to get people to believe me

08:35.448 --> 08:37.575
by relying on someone nobody believes?

08:37.650 --> 08:40.015
He predicted the earthquake
from your vision.

08:40.119 --> 08:43.087
Predicted five other earthquakes
that never happened.

08:43.188 --> 08:46.920
Obviously he's gotten the kinks
of his prediction system worked out.

08:46.993 --> 08:50.156
That's not obvious.
That's the exact opposite of obvious.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.861
Excuse me, Dr. Foote?

08:54.033 --> 08:55.660
Dr. Foote!

08:57.737 --> 08:59.898
Hi, I'm Eli Stone. I'm an attorney.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.570
This earthquake proofing
is exactly to code.

09:03.643 --> 09:06.407
And it's patented,
so don't even try to rip me off.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.845
Dr. Foote,
We're here because we believe you.

09:08.948 --> 09:10.711
Oh, nobody believed me. Nice try.

09:10.816 --> 09:13.979
None of the hecklers have tried,
"Hey, we believe you" before.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.816
You get points for originality.

09:15.922 --> 09:18.618
Thank you. We're not here
to heckle you, to sue you,

09:18.691 --> 09:21.660
we're not here to rip you off.
I'm here because...

09:21.727 --> 09:25.390
Well, I'm very interested
in your method of earthquake prediction.

09:25.464 --> 09:29.332
Seismic prognostication. Well...

09:29.402 --> 09:32.371
So how does it work?
You have a seismometer or something?

09:32.438 --> 09:35.930
You're looking at it. Follow me.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.375
Wipe your feet please, gentlemen.

09:41.581 --> 09:45.540
Well, the entire house is basically
an extremely large seismic station.

09:45.618 --> 09:49.145
Each brace not only protects the house
from seismic undulation,

09:49.221 --> 09:53.783
but also collects data from the
motion-amplifying mechanical linkages.

09:53.893 --> 09:56.418
I'm not a scientist.
You're basically saying

09:56.495 --> 10:00.363
that this whole house
is a giant earthquake detecting device?

10:00.433 --> 10:01.991
And a tax write-off, yes.

10:02.101 --> 10:06.868
But you've never accurately
predicted an earthquake using it.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.566
I hate that word, "predict. "

10:08.641 --> 10:12.304
Lmplies psychic powers, clumps me
with palm readers, fortune tellers.

10:12.378 --> 10:16.678
What's your family think about turning
the house into a giant earthquake thing?

10:16.749 --> 10:21.083
They don't. My wife moved everybody
down to Cupertino.

10:21.153 --> 10:24.645
Better for them, anyway.
As far away from this city, the better.

10:24.724 --> 10:28.285
And the quake you say is coming,
where do you think the epicenter'll be?

10:28.394 --> 10:31.261
Not think. Know.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.895
Here. Come here.

10:39.538 --> 10:40.903
See these lines?

10:41.007 --> 10:45.273
These are the seven major faults
lying underneath the Bay Area.

10:45.344 --> 10:48.108
Now my algorithm says
the epicenter will be inland.

10:48.214 --> 10:52.082
- Most likely here, Silver Terrace.
- Silver Terrace. You don't say.

10:52.151 --> 10:55.518
The magnitude of the quake,
6.5 at least, would mean shockwaves

10:55.588 --> 10:57.351
that could destroy things like...

10:57.456 --> 10:59.822
- The Golden Gate Bridge.
- Yeah.

11:01.894 --> 11:05.022
Dr. Foote, how far
are you prepared to take this?

11:05.097 --> 11:08.794
You mean to get people to listen to me,
to grasp the danger?

11:08.868 --> 11:13.134
Well, Mr. Stone, I have lost my family,
my job, my reputation,

11:13.205 --> 11:17.335
a large percentage of my dignity.
So pretty far.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.507
- You can't be serious.
- No, I can be. I promise.

11:22.581 --> 11:25.482
You're asking the court
to close the Golden Gate Bridge.

11:25.551 --> 11:28.645
I'm asking the court to order the city
to close the Golden Gate.

11:28.721 --> 11:31.986
- Under this writ of mad anus?
- Mandamus, Your Honor.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.288
A law so old,
it's written on a stone tablet.

11:34.360 --> 11:38.023
It only applies if the city isn't
meeting one of its legal obligations.

11:38.097 --> 11:40.622
Protecting health and welfare
of its citizenry.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.760
- Citizenry are doing fine.
- Won't be three days from now.

11:43.836 --> 11:47.272
This is where he trots out the quack
with the crackpot prediction.

11:47.339 --> 11:50.638
Doctor Foote has degrees
from Stanford, MIT, and Caltech.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.543
An oh-for-five record
in forecasting earthquakes.

11:53.612 --> 11:57.981
Mandamus law presupposes the plaintiff
possesses better judgment than the city.

11:58.084 --> 12:00.382
- I don't think Dr. Foote qualifies.
- But I do.

12:00.453 --> 12:03.217
You'll notice that
I'm the named plaintiff here.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.984
Dr. Foote is providing
the evidence I'm relying upon.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.288
Bringing me back
to "quack" and "crackpot. "

12:08.360 --> 12:11.852
Maybe this isn't ideal for
closing the bridge for the first time.

12:11.931 --> 12:16.891
The Golden Gate's been closed three
times due to forecasts of high winds.

12:17.002 --> 12:19.698
Except instead of winds,
we're talking earthquake.

12:19.772 --> 12:23.538
- Assuming you believe Dr. Foote.
- No, Your Honor, assuming that you do.

12:23.642 --> 12:25.610
Hundreds of lives are at stake here.

12:25.678 --> 12:28.010
What's a few hours to listen to the man?

12:28.080 --> 12:29.843
Your Honor...

12:31.650 --> 12:35.177
If I dismiss this, I have to start
a trial on accounting practices.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.882
I'll do anything
to put that off for a day or two.

12:37.957 --> 12:40.790
Have your witness in court
at ten tomorrow.

12:40.860 --> 12:43.988
Next.

12:48.367 --> 12:51.495
Lan Young from New York
is downstairs talking to Matt Dowd.

12:51.570 --> 12:55.131
Charlotte Phillips from Chicago
is downstairs checking her email

12:55.241 --> 12:59.302
- on my computer this very minute.
- Are you live-blogging the office now?

12:59.378 --> 13:02.939
No, but I'm a woman, I'm a lawyer
and I'm Jordan Wethersby's daughter.

13:03.048 --> 13:06.108
And I know when some bitch
is trying to orchestrate a revolt.

13:06.185 --> 13:08.847
I assume the "wicked witch"
to whom you're referring

13:08.921 --> 13:10.980
is one of this firm's founding partners?

13:11.056 --> 13:14.719
Marci is hardly the first lawyer
to try to throw me off my perch.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.820
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Your father's made of Kevlar.

13:17.897 --> 13:22.027
Your favorite son is at it again.
Do you have any idea what he just did?

13:22.868 --> 13:26.167
- I can't say that I do.
- And I can't say that I'm surprised.

13:26.238 --> 13:29.537
As managing partner,
you manage to turn a blind eye

13:29.608 --> 13:31.439
where Eli Stone is concerned.

13:31.510 --> 13:35.571
He just sued San Francisco.
The entire city.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.776
He's asking a judge
to close down the Golden Gate Bridge.

13:38.851 --> 13:41.411
If he is, I'm sure he has a good reason.
I'll talk to him.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.817
I've got this one.

13:42.888 --> 13:45.152
I just wanted to see
if you were in the loop.

13:45.224 --> 13:47.192
Since you don't seem to be.

13:49.328 --> 13:52.024
I wish someone would
throw a bucket of water on her.

13:52.097 --> 13:53.530
Are you gonna talk to Eli?

13:53.599 --> 13:56.830
Tell him to stop giving Marci
ammunition to use against you?

13:56.902 --> 14:00.668
- It hadn't occurred to me to do so, no.
- Well, it occurs to me.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.333
I have a surprise for you.

14:04.443 --> 14:06.809
- Oh, um...
- Better than a surprise, actually.

14:06.912 --> 14:08.277
It's another gift.

14:08.347 --> 14:11.316
Oh, really,
the frame was generous enough.

14:11.417 --> 14:14.318
We're gonna be saving people
from an actual earthquake.

14:14.386 --> 14:18.083
Hundreds, maybe thousands, of lives.
We're gonna be like superheroes.

14:18.157 --> 14:22.321
But with suits and briefcases
instead of capes and secret identities.

14:22.394 --> 14:25.522
- This is your earthquake case?
- It's our earthquake case.

14:25.598 --> 14:29.227
- You're my second chair.
- Oh, I can't do it, Eli.

14:30.736 --> 14:33.068
Why? Scott doesn't get in
for another week.

14:33.138 --> 14:35.971
The case will be over by then.
Believe me, it has to be.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.668
That's not the problem.

14:37.743 --> 14:40.405
I'm kind of working for Miss Klein
on something.

14:40.479 --> 14:43.505
- Medusa Klein?
- Have you filed the appearance?

14:43.582 --> 14:46.210
Yes. You are the attorney
of record for the city.

14:46.285 --> 14:48.446
We are, Miss Dekker.

14:48.554 --> 14:49.885
You and Miss Klein are...

14:49.955 --> 14:52.719
Opposing counsel
in your earthquake case, yes.

14:52.825 --> 14:56.852
Pro bono, as you might be familiar.
We'll see you in court.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.165
Oh, I see you filled the frame.
Is that Scott?

15:04.236 --> 15:07.535
Yeah, that's Scott and me
in New York last year.

15:08.540 --> 15:10.007
See you in court, Eli.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.245
I'll see you soon, Macaroni.

15:16.315 --> 15:19.284
...in 20 minutes.
It's Thursday the 24th.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.555
Stone, what was it you wanted yesterday?

15:30.629 --> 15:32.722
Now's really not a good time, Matt.

15:32.798 --> 15:35.358
Beggars can't be choosers.
One of those facts of life.

15:35.467 --> 15:36.991
Could you give me a minute?

15:38.671 --> 15:41.640
OK. I'm late for Marci and Maggie
to try and shred me in court,

15:41.740 --> 15:43.367
so I'm gonna keep this brief.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.808
I'm going in to have
the aneurysm taken out.

15:45.911 --> 15:50.610
Chances are I won't survive the surgery,
so I need someone to draft a living will

15:50.683 --> 15:52.913
so my wishes and dignity are protected.

15:52.985 --> 15:57.081
And my heartstrings will be
so tugged on, I'll be limp for your ex.

15:57.156 --> 16:00.091
- Nice try, Stone.
- Whoa. This isn't about you and Taylor.

16:00.159 --> 16:03.720
It is about not living like a vegetable
one second longer than I have to.

16:03.829 --> 16:05.797
I need this to be ironclad.

16:05.898 --> 16:08.992
I need to draft it
without sympathy or sentiment.

16:09.068 --> 16:12.435
- I am fairly unsympathetic.
- This is what I'm counting on.

16:12.538 --> 16:15.769
We're going to put your utter
lack of humanity to good use.

16:22.915 --> 16:27.045
- You had your career in front of you.
- Tenured Berkeley professor at 32.

16:27.119 --> 16:31.021
Vice president of the
American Seismological Society at 35.

16:31.857 --> 16:36.794
By all objective measures, I was poised
to become the leader in my field.

16:36.862 --> 16:39.126
- But you didn't.
- No, like Ahab,

16:39.198 --> 16:43.225
I developed a single-minded vendetta
against a white whale.

16:43.302 --> 16:47.204
It was forecasting and preventing
a devastating seismic catastrophe.

16:47.272 --> 16:51.834
Predicting the big one, you mean?
The next great San Francisco earthquake.

16:51.910 --> 16:56.438
- That's right.
- You haven't been successful so far.

16:56.515 --> 17:00.815
No. Took Edison almost a year before the
first successful test of the light bulb.

17:00.886 --> 17:05.050
The first powered glider built by the
Wright Brothers flew for three seconds.

17:05.124 --> 17:09.083
Failure is merely a road to success.
I've refined my methodology.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.857
I can tell you with 98 percent certainty
this quake is coming.

17:13.598 --> 17:16.762
- When?
- Two days. During rush hour.

17:18.069 --> 17:20.231
Your Honor, at this time, I'd move

17:20.305 --> 17:24.537
that Mr. Foote's testimony be removed
from the record and the case dismissed.

17:24.609 --> 17:26.942
Miss Klein's been in Europe
for three years,

17:27.012 --> 17:30.072
but generally the defendants
cross-examine at this point.

17:30.149 --> 17:34.017
Mr. Stone is right,
I have been out of the country recently,

17:34.086 --> 17:36.520
but I presume Daubert
is still on the books?

17:36.588 --> 17:39.056
Scientific testimony is inadmissible

17:39.124 --> 17:43.220
unless generally accepted
by the scientific community.

17:43.295 --> 17:46.787
What members of the scientific community
back your claim, sir?

17:48.167 --> 17:52.501
Uh, well, some of my colleagues
have been really intrigued by my work.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.938
But the exact number who
actually believe you would be zero.

17:56.008 --> 17:59.136
- Your Honor...
- She's within the bounds, counselor.

17:59.211 --> 18:01.304
So, no scientists.
That's all right.

18:01.380 --> 18:05.544
What about laypeople?
Perhaps a sympathetic journalist?

18:06.585 --> 18:08.917
- Not that I'm aware of.
- You're the only one

18:08.987 --> 18:12.354
- who believes this quake is coming.
- Mr. Stone appears to believe me.

18:12.424 --> 18:17.054
- And your wife, I'm sure.
- I don't know. You'd have to ask her.

18:17.129 --> 18:19.893
- Are you estranged from your wife, sir?
- She left me.

18:19.998 --> 18:22.330
- When?
- September four, 2005.

18:22.401 --> 18:26.565
You seem to be fairly accurate with that
date. Does it have some significance?

18:26.638 --> 18:29.471
It was the date
of the last earthquake I forecast.

18:30.375 --> 18:34.311
I don't seem to remember
an earthquake on that exact date.

18:34.379 --> 18:35.812
Funny thing.

18:37.516 --> 18:39.780
- I'm not laughing, Eli.
- Are you sure?

18:39.852 --> 18:42.480
I think a catastrophic earthquake
is hilarious.

18:42.554 --> 18:45.489
Help me. "Catastrophic" like
the last one you predicted?

18:45.557 --> 18:48.617
I'm not predicting this one.
There's a scientist, Foote...

18:48.694 --> 18:51.390
Look, I have supported
everything you've done

18:51.463 --> 18:54.091
except when it comes
to catastrophic earthquakes,

18:54.166 --> 18:55.599
where you have a blind spot.

18:55.667 --> 18:58.431
- What's my "blind spot" this time?
- Marci Klein.

18:58.537 --> 19:01.438
She is using
this little crusade of yours

19:01.507 --> 19:05.136
as evidence my father
doesn't have a grip on his own firm.

19:05.210 --> 19:08.577
That's right.
You push this and my father,

19:08.680 --> 19:11.774
the man who's been
like a father to you, takes the hit.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.420
I can drop the case.
The earthquake case.

19:16.488 --> 19:21.448
I can recuse myself immediately,
get my client new counsel.

19:21.560 --> 19:25.519
I doubt you'll find another attorney
in this city as eccentric as yourself.

19:25.597 --> 19:28.760
It's not like you to bail on a client.
Is something the matter?

19:28.867 --> 19:32.769
No, not with me. But with you.
I've heard rumblings.

19:32.838 --> 19:38.333
And did you hear them from
a tall female associate who has my eyes?

19:38.410 --> 19:42.574
Taylor may have mentioned that there
could be political consequences for you

19:42.648 --> 19:45.139
if I continue with this case.

19:45.217 --> 19:47.310
And you've decided to come to my rescue.

19:47.386 --> 19:51.516
You were there for me. You've stood up
for me, protected me, represented me.

19:51.590 --> 19:56.618
- Now I'm here for you.
- An attitude that, however noble,

19:56.695 --> 20:00.461
presumes this recusing yourself
is your decision to make.

20:00.566 --> 20:01.931
It's not?

20:02.000 --> 20:05.094
Every case you have tried
or ever will try at this firm,

20:05.170 --> 20:07.638
has been and will be done so
at my pleasure.

20:07.706 --> 20:10.539
If I hadn't wanted you
to represent Daniel Foote

20:10.609 --> 20:13.703
or, for that matter,
Beth Keller or Arvin Solinsky,

20:13.779 --> 20:17.010
make no mistake, you wouldn't have.

20:17.082 --> 20:21.178
And, while I appreciate
your newly located sense of loyalty...

20:22.187 --> 20:25.554
...you started this case.
It's not finished yet.

20:26.558 --> 20:30.824
My lawyers finish
their cases, understood?

20:32.297 --> 20:33.628
Yes, sir.

20:36.068 --> 20:39.003
Hey, I can't believe
I'm going to beat you.

20:39.071 --> 20:42.336
Marci's going to. You're not
gonna be doing any of the talking.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.568
- Hearing's not over yet.
- Tell me about it.

20:44.676 --> 20:47.110
I'm serious.
Marci says she has big plans for me.

20:47.179 --> 20:51.741
Maggie, why do you think Marci
chose you to second chair?

20:51.817 --> 20:54.752
My work in the
St. Vincent's malpractice trial.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.378
Which was really my work,

20:56.488 --> 20:59.514
which Marci, being a very
clever person, would find out.

20:59.591 --> 21:02.219
- What are you saying?
- Out of all the associates,

21:02.294 --> 21:04.455
she didn't pick
the most experienced one.

21:04.563 --> 21:06.326
So why do you think she picked you?

21:06.431 --> 21:09.662
Because I'm spunky.
And a hard worker.

21:09.735 --> 21:13.193
And you know more about me
than almost anyone else at this firm.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.105
Picked you so she can pump you
for information about me.

21:16.208 --> 21:20.076
- My tactics, my strategy, my history.
- What about your over-inflated ego?

21:20.145 --> 21:23.581
I'm just saying, what if Foote's right?

21:23.649 --> 21:27.415
People could die. People.

21:27.519 --> 21:29.578
Or a person you know.

21:29.655 --> 21:33.022
Just... When she comes to you,
and she will,

21:33.125 --> 21:36.959
just don't be, um... you.

21:40.232 --> 21:43.793
You know, I can see why
you're representing Dr. Foote.

21:43.869 --> 21:46.531
You're both great at alienating people.

21:53.845 --> 21:57.611
Your Honor, we'd like to call
a rebuttal witness, Moira Foote.

21:57.683 --> 22:01.619
Unless Mrs. Foote is a seismologist
herself, I don't see the relevance.

22:01.687 --> 22:03.746
Miss Klein made her relevant yesterday

22:03.822 --> 22:06.086
when she asked Dr. Foote
about his marriage.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.682
Bring her up.

22:13.899 --> 22:16.197
I think the thing
I loved most about Daniel

22:16.268 --> 22:18.634
was that he liked
bacon and eggs for dinner.

22:18.704 --> 22:22.071
He never understood why certain foods
were rigidly considered

22:22.174 --> 22:25.666
only for breakfast.
He challenged life that way.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.703
He questioned everything.

22:28.780 --> 22:31.613
I think, yesterday,
we were left with the impression

22:31.683 --> 22:34.811
that you separated
because Daniel was crazy.

22:38.924 --> 22:41.017
Albert Einstein filled his closet

22:41.093 --> 22:43.960
with multiple pairs
of the same shirt and pants

22:44.029 --> 22:47.089
so he wouldn't have to
waste a thought on what to wear.

22:49.234 --> 22:51.395
It was a quirk of genius.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.699
Today that same behavior
would be labeled OCD.

22:54.773 --> 22:58.539
Do you believe Daniel's machine
can predict earthquakes?

22:59.544 --> 23:03.002
Honestly, I'm not sure.
But that's not the point.

23:03.081 --> 23:06.209
I didn't leave Daniel because
I thought he was wrong.

23:06.284 --> 23:11.051
I left because being right
was more important to him than I was.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.393
Given that Mrs. Foote
offered no relevant testimony,

23:21.466 --> 23:24.026
I have no cross-examination.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.366
It's kind of like, "To be or not to be. "

23:26.438 --> 23:28.133
Kind of.

23:28.206 --> 23:30.970
Except for the
"I'll already be brain dead" part.

23:31.042 --> 23:32.373
There is that.

23:32.444 --> 23:35.811
If it's any consolation,
I already think of you as brain dead.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.882
Well, I appreciate that.

23:37.949 --> 23:40.417
"I do not want my life prolonged

23:40.485 --> 23:42.976
if I have an incurable
and terminal condition,

23:43.054 --> 23:46.888
or if I become unconscious
and am unlikely to regain consciousness.

23:46.958 --> 23:49.620
I wish to be permitted to die. "

23:49.694 --> 23:52.254
- This is cheerful. Where do I sign?
- Here.

23:58.003 --> 24:01.734
It's not even noon and I've already
made my end-of-life decision.

24:01.807 --> 24:04.275
What have you done so far today?

24:06.878 --> 24:11.247
I'm sorry. This whole thing
is a little depressing.

24:11.316 --> 24:13.443
I can't imagine why.

24:14.352 --> 24:16.081
Yeah. I'm pissed at him.

24:16.154 --> 24:19.646
After everything my father's done
for Eli, he can't drop one stupid...

24:19.724 --> 24:22.591
...incredibly stupid case.
- Yeah, well, you know...

24:24.763 --> 24:26.594
- What did I just say?
- Excuse me?

24:26.665 --> 24:28.929
Have any idea what
I've been talking about?

24:29.000 --> 24:30.968
Sure. Of course.

24:31.036 --> 24:35.268
Now what looks good to you here?
I was thinking the oxtail carpaccio.

24:35.340 --> 24:37.035
Look, it's probably been a while

24:37.108 --> 24:40.737
since you managed a date without
a woman who did it professionally,

24:40.812 --> 24:44.077
but you're expected to pay attention
to the woman you're with.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.411
Sorry.

24:48.487 --> 24:53.117
Look, obviously we're a little off here.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.860
- Tell me what's on your mind.
- Nothing.

24:59.264 --> 25:02.165
Well, maybe you should
go a little easier on Eli.

25:02.234 --> 25:03.997
See, I was paying attention.

25:04.069 --> 25:06.128
- Go easy on Eli?
- Yeah.

25:06.204 --> 25:07.865
Since when do you care?

25:07.939 --> 25:12.603
My father has done everything for him.
He could do this one thing for my dad.

25:12.677 --> 25:16.443
I think Eli's just been
a little focused on other stuff lately.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.483
What kind of stuff?

25:19.584 --> 25:22.519
Does this to do with the legal thing
he wanted your help on?

25:22.587 --> 25:26.114
I'm taking care of something for him.
And everything I know is...

25:26.191 --> 25:30.890
Privileged? Eli and I used to
tell each other all the time.

25:30.962 --> 25:33.522
Well, don't put me in that position.

25:34.966 --> 25:38.265
However, I can think of
several positions you could put me in.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.466
It's hard to believe
you'd botch the one evening you had

25:43.542 --> 25:45.840
to prove you're not all pig.

25:46.978 --> 25:50.846
City budget number crunching, crunched.
What should I do next?

25:51.750 --> 25:55.186
Go home. I think you've worked
hard enough for tonight.

25:55.253 --> 25:57.221
But it's only 10:00.

25:57.289 --> 26:00.656
Whatever you may have heard,
Miss Dekker, I'm not a monster.

26:01.493 --> 26:04.189
- That's not what I meant.
- Get some rest.

26:08.333 --> 26:11.496
I know how hard this case
must be on you.

26:11.603 --> 26:13.230
What?

26:14.005 --> 26:16.565
Jordan and I, we had a thing once.

26:16.641 --> 26:19.872
Before he was married,
before we started this firm,

26:19.945 --> 26:24.712
we used to take each other on in court
and outside of court.

26:24.816 --> 26:27.785
I understand how difficult it is
to sit across the aisle

26:27.852 --> 26:31.481
- from someone you're close to.
- Eli and I aren't close.

26:31.556 --> 26:35.856
Really? I looked over his recent cases,
you've worked on nearly all of them.

26:35.927 --> 26:38.760
I needed courtroom experience.

26:38.830 --> 26:40.991
Perhaps you could
help me with something.

26:41.066 --> 26:43.694
Oh, I'm really not all that helpful.

26:43.768 --> 26:48.000
Looking through his caseload,
it seems that illegal aliens and kids

26:48.073 --> 26:50.405
get his most zealous representation,

26:50.475 --> 26:54.241
where our higher-end clients,
Arvin Solinsky, Zyre Motors,

26:54.346 --> 26:56.280
get something less than his A-game.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.009
Actually, in the Solinsky case,

26:58.083 --> 27:00.984
Eli did everything he could
to evacuate Silver Terrace.

27:01.052 --> 27:04.818
- Evacuate? You mean evict.
- Right, evict.

27:05.390 --> 27:09.417
Isn't Silver Terrace the alleged
epicenter of the alleged earthquake?

27:09.494 --> 27:12.588
- I should really go.
- Sit down, Miss Dekker.

27:13.498 --> 27:17.264
You are going to tell me
everything you know about Eli Stone,

27:17.369 --> 27:21.499
Silver Terrace
and imaginary earthquakes.

27:22.407 --> 27:26.503
He told me things in confidence.
I can't say anything.

27:26.578 --> 27:29.877
You not only can, you're obligated to.

27:34.619 --> 27:37.452
Well, counsel, can we proceed
with final arguments?

27:37.522 --> 27:41.618
Actually, we have our own rebuttal
witness to call, Your Honor.

27:41.693 --> 27:44.457
- Margaret Ann Dekker.
- Objection, Your Honor.

27:44.562 --> 27:47.929
Miss Maggie Dekker
is an attorney of record here.

27:47.999 --> 27:49.694
This is a hearing, not a trial.

27:49.768 --> 27:53.727
And, in any case, Miss Dekker
hasn't said a word in court thus far.

27:53.838 --> 27:56.568
Objection overruled.
Take the stand, Miss Dekker.

28:06.217 --> 28:09.778
- What's that girl going to say?
- Nothing good.

28:09.854 --> 28:11.412
I will.

28:11.489 --> 28:15.926
Miss Dekker, in your capacity
as one of Mr. Stone's co-workers,

28:15.994 --> 28:18.622
have you noticed
a change in his legal practice?

28:18.697 --> 28:21.723
Objection. Neither myself
nor my practice are on trial.

28:21.800 --> 28:25.736
I'll admit it is not like his
disbarment proceeding two months ago,

28:25.804 --> 28:28.500
but Mr. Stone has put himself at issue

28:28.573 --> 28:31.542
by seeking the mandamus writ
personally, Your Honor.

28:31.609 --> 28:35.170
Checkmate, counselor. Sit down.

28:38.316 --> 28:43.219
Eli is trying to represent
more individuals and less corporations.

28:43.288 --> 28:45.153
There's nothing wrong with that.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.691
I'm sure we would all agree,
Miss Dekker.

28:47.759 --> 28:51.092
But could you tell the judge
how Mr. Stone tried to "help"

28:51.162 --> 28:55.326
the citizens Silver Terrace when
they sued his client, Arvin Solinsky?

28:55.400 --> 28:59.063
He was concerned for their welfare.
He wanted them to get a good deal.

28:59.137 --> 29:01.901
Wanted them out of their homes
as quickly as possible.

29:01.973 --> 29:04.840
- That's what Mr. Solinsky wanted.
- Not for the same reason.

29:04.909 --> 29:06.536
She's leading the witness.

29:06.611 --> 29:08.579
Permission to treat witness as hostile.

29:08.646 --> 29:12.514
- Your own co-counsel?
- I don't get along with my co-workers.

29:12.584 --> 29:16.884
Why did Eli Stone want the citizens
of Silver Terrace to vacate their homes?

29:18.022 --> 29:20.855
How can anyone know
what's in another person's mind?

29:20.925 --> 29:23.894
- What did he tell you, Miss Dekker?
- Objection. Hearsay.

29:23.962 --> 29:27.090
I'm not going to be
admitting this as truth, believe me.

29:31.402 --> 29:32.960
He said that...

29:35.039 --> 29:37.098
...that there would be an earthquake.

29:37.175 --> 29:39.905
But not because
Dr. Foote told him, right?

29:40.812 --> 29:45.306
Tell the judge why Mr. Stone thought
there would be an earthquake.

29:51.322 --> 29:53.756
He said that...

29:55.693 --> 29:58.218
That he could see the future.

30:04.969 --> 30:06.732
Pass the witness.

30:15.413 --> 30:19.975
When I told you that there would be
an earthquake, what did you tell me?

30:21.219 --> 30:22.743
That I believed you.

30:30.495 --> 30:34.261
All rise, the Honorable
Judge Gaitan presiding.

30:34.332 --> 30:35.856
Be seated.

30:40.872 --> 30:42.635
For a writ of mandamus to issue,

30:42.707 --> 30:45.608
the respondent must be
in violation of its civic duty.

30:45.677 --> 30:50.808
Furthermore, the required action must,
by its very nature, be imperative.

30:50.882 --> 30:54.045
A city that fails to protect
its citizens from an earthquake

30:54.152 --> 30:57.519
it knows is coming,
most certainly satisfies that criteria.

30:58.590 --> 31:01.821
But the supported opinion
of a fringe scientist,

31:01.893 --> 31:06.455
represented by an attorney
of questionable sound mind,

31:06.564 --> 31:09.727
just as clearly
does not meet that criteria.

31:11.269 --> 31:16.332
Applicant's writ of mandamus to close
the Golden Gate Bridge is denied.

31:18.643 --> 31:20.804
This court is adjourned.

31:23.514 --> 31:26.244
Excellent second chair, Miss Dekker.

31:32.257 --> 31:35.124
You're insane. If I'd wanted
to be laughed out of court,

31:35.193 --> 31:37.627
- I'd have just represented myself.
- I'm sorry.

31:37.695 --> 31:40.425
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.
Sorry I let you rope me into this,

31:40.498 --> 31:43.592
sorry I let you use me as
a mouthpiece for your nutbaggery.

31:43.668 --> 31:47.399
- No, I didn't. I believe you.
- Because you're cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

31:47.472 --> 31:49.736
At least I have a machine,
a methodology.

31:49.807 --> 31:51.832
- I can file an emergency appeal.
- No.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.242
If you try,
I will get a restraining order.

31:54.312 --> 31:56.041
You stay away from me.

31:58.850 --> 32:02.217
- Another satisfied client.
- It's all my fault.

32:02.287 --> 32:04.847
You got to tell Scott
to stay off the Golden Gate.

32:04.923 --> 32:08.256
- Come on, Eli.
- He calls you "Macaroni. "

32:09.727 --> 32:12.093
If I wasn't right,
how else would I know that?

32:12.196 --> 32:14.357
Well, I must've told you.

32:14.465 --> 32:17.628
First it was Magg-aroni and cheese,
then it was Magg-aroni,

32:17.735 --> 32:20.670
- then it was just Macaroni.
- No, you didn't tell me.

32:20.738 --> 32:22.706
I'd remember being that bored.

32:25.476 --> 32:28.036
Just call him. Do it for me.

32:37.155 --> 32:39.487
Patti, I could use
some good news right now.

32:39.557 --> 32:41.889
Eli, where have you been?
Paul Miller called.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.327
- He'd like to meet you and Dr. Foote.
- Great. Who's Paul Miller?

32:45.430 --> 32:49.560
- The chief aid to the mayor.
- The mayor of San Francisco?

32:49.634 --> 32:54.401
No, the mayor of Munchkinland.
He is waiting for you at City Hall.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.878
I don't want to do this.

33:01.946 --> 33:06.315
I'd like to be anyone other
than the person leading this charge.

33:06.417 --> 33:10.376
Jordan, Martin Posner and I
founded this firm together.

33:10.488 --> 33:12.251
And it was found on the principle

33:12.357 --> 33:15.520
that we would set a new standard
for legal representation.

33:15.593 --> 33:19.290
That our clients would be
the best and the brightest,

33:19.364 --> 33:22.390
the largest and the most successful.

33:22.467 --> 33:25.334
But those clients are leaving.

33:25.403 --> 33:29.635
And they will not come back until
they've received a clear signal from us

33:29.707 --> 33:32.369
that we have seen the error of our ways.

33:32.443 --> 33:36.174
Unfortunately, that signal
needs to be louder

33:36.247 --> 33:39.705
than the firing of
one renegade associate.

33:39.784 --> 33:42.309
It needs to be the ouster of the man

33:42.387 --> 33:46.847
who's allowing him
to damage our firm and its reputation.

33:51.963 --> 33:56.024
Eli Stone has not damaged
the reputation of this firm.

34:01.339 --> 34:03.773
Mr. Stone was representing an individual

34:03.841 --> 34:09.143
with a legitimate, albeit ultimately
unsuccessful, cause of action.

34:09.213 --> 34:10.771
If it weren't legitimate,

34:10.882 --> 34:14.545
the court wouldn't have entertained
a three-day hearing.

34:15.286 --> 34:19.449
Miss Klein's problem with Mr. Stone
isn't that he's eccentric,

34:19.524 --> 34:23.358
it's that he applies
his considerable talents

34:23.428 --> 34:28.195
to underdogs and individuals
instead of conglomerates and CEOs.

34:28.266 --> 34:31.827
He reminds us that, in business,
there is still room for humanity,

34:31.936 --> 34:36.498
that capitalism without mercy
is tantamount to evil.

34:36.607 --> 34:38.074
He reminds us...

34:40.945 --> 34:43.038
...of the best parts of ourselves.

34:43.114 --> 34:45.878
Yes, I have protected Eli Stone

34:45.949 --> 34:49.716
because I believe
this firm needs Eli Stone.

34:49.786 --> 34:52.620
I believe that every firm,

34:52.690 --> 34:57.457
every company,
everyone needs an Eli Stone.

34:58.996 --> 35:02.124
And, by your vote,
you'll say whether or not you agree.

35:02.200 --> 35:05.636
If you don't,
then this place has become something

35:05.703 --> 35:08.069
I don't want my name on, anyway.

35:12.210 --> 35:14.144
Would you mind repeating that?

35:14.212 --> 35:17.579
Because, full disclosure here,
I've been known to hear things.

35:17.648 --> 35:20.742
Mayor's closing the Golden Gate,
despite the judge's ruling.

35:20.818 --> 35:24.754
I probably shouldn't ask this, but why?

35:24.822 --> 35:28.690
For one thing, when Dr. Foote's
not shouting hysterical proclamations

35:28.759 --> 35:32.627
from the front steps of this building,
he's actually quite persuasive.

35:32.697 --> 35:33.925
Thank you.

35:33.998 --> 35:36.967
Truth be told, he wasn't
the one who persuaded the mayor.

35:37.068 --> 35:39.229
Are you talking about me?

35:40.872 --> 35:44.137
What if Daniel and I are wrong
and there's no quake?

35:44.208 --> 35:46.642
What if you are right
and we did nothing?

35:47.245 --> 35:48.610
Fair point.

35:50.515 --> 35:53.541
The one person in the entire city
who believes us

35:53.618 --> 35:55.142
just happens to be the mayor.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.017
Talk about dumb luck.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.095
This better be good, Dowd.
I'm missing Oprah.

36:05.163 --> 36:09.623
- Dr. Oz is on.
- This is only slightly more important.

36:09.700 --> 36:12.362
It might help us to know what "this" is.

36:12.436 --> 36:15.803
Before I go in for
my minor life-or-death surgery,

36:15.873 --> 36:18.842
I wanted to make sure
that I don't get Terry Schiavo'ed.

36:18.910 --> 36:23.438
He's asked me to draft
an Advanced Healthcare Directive.

36:23.514 --> 36:28.144
I would've asked you, but I needed
someone without conscience or sympathy.

36:28.219 --> 36:30.050
- No offense.
- None taken.

36:30.121 --> 36:32.851
Eli, I'm sure there's no need...

36:32.924 --> 36:36.223
I mean, I'm sure these surgeries
usually work out fine.

36:36.294 --> 36:39.457
Only 50 percent of the time.
I've been reading up.

36:39.530 --> 36:42.556
Eli's a coin toss away
from being a vegetable.

36:42.633 --> 36:43.998
Thank you, Patti.

36:44.101 --> 36:48.265
In any case, I need to get it witnessed,
which is why you guys are here.

36:53.878 --> 36:58.315
You want us to witness
your suicide note?

36:58.382 --> 37:01.681
It's not a suicide note.
It's a statement of my wishes.

37:01.752 --> 37:04.050
About how you want to die.

37:04.121 --> 37:08.888
About how and under what circumstances
I don't want to live.

37:17.134 --> 37:18.692
Thank you.

37:20.438 --> 37:22.406
Eli, you draft your will yet?

37:24.242 --> 37:27.905
I left you all my George Michael CDs.
I figured that was appropriate.

37:32.216 --> 37:35.447
I guess since you're Eli's lawyer
for this, privilege would...

37:35.519 --> 37:37.987
Prevent me from
bringing it up on a date.

37:39.390 --> 37:41.153
Excellent.

37:41.993 --> 37:46.362
So, if you'll all go
to the nearest exits,

37:47.331 --> 37:51.199
Golden Gate Park is the safest place
for the imminent earthquake.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.362
- Eli.
- Please just do it for me.

37:53.437 --> 37:55.803
Consider it a last request
if you have to.

37:55.873 --> 37:59.240
But Golden Gate Park. Not Bridge, OK?

38:12.256 --> 38:16.158
Excuse me. Hello!

38:21.465 --> 38:22.625
Hello!

38:25.670 --> 38:27.399
Hi.

38:28.406 --> 38:33.241
Sorry to interrupt,
but I have it on very good authority

38:33.844 --> 38:36.813
that in about an hour from now...

38:37.815 --> 38:40.147
...there's going to be an earthquake.

38:40.217 --> 38:43.243
A big one. The big one.

38:45.389 --> 38:47.050
So I'm leaving.

38:47.124 --> 38:49.422
And I hope you'll do the same,

38:49.493 --> 38:53.987
because I'm guessing that 22 stories
up in the air surrounded by glass

38:54.065 --> 38:56.932
is going to be
one of the less desirable places to be.

38:57.001 --> 39:00.300
Now I know that most of you,
if not all of you, think that I'm crazy.

39:00.371 --> 39:02.134
The lawyer with a hole in his head,

39:02.239 --> 39:05.697
and the inappropriately-timed song
in his heart.

39:07.345 --> 39:10.246
And I know that, as lawyers,
we're trained to rely on fact

39:10.314 --> 39:12.339
and empirical evidence...

39:14.852 --> 39:18.788
...but I'm asking you,
I'm asking each and every one of you...

39:20.658 --> 39:24.025
...this one time,
with the stakes so completely high...

39:25.596 --> 39:31.535
...to believe me
and take something on faith.

39:34.105 --> 39:37.199
Trust me, you won't regret it.

39:49.954 --> 39:51.649
So who's with me?

40:13.911 --> 40:16.038
I've tallied the partners' votes

40:16.113 --> 40:20.880
and, uh, well, Jordan,
there's no easy way to say this...

40:21.585 --> 40:23.610
I think you just did, Marci.

40:23.687 --> 40:27.646
But, for the record,
it is the decision of the partnership

40:27.758 --> 40:32.320
that Jordan Wethersby be removed
from his post as managing partner,

40:32.430 --> 40:34.990
effective immediately.

40:36.167 --> 40:39.295
Truly, Jordan, I am sorry.

40:39.370 --> 40:41.235
I'm not.

40:43.507 --> 40:47.773
I can live with the partners' decision.
I hope they can.

41:17.308 --> 41:22.211
Marci, I'd like a re-vote.

41:24.748 --> 41:27.273
Excuse me, Tom.

41:27.351 --> 41:30.013
I told you, 6.8 on the Richter Scale.

41:30.087 --> 41:32.112
- Maggie!
- Oh, Eli!

41:32.189 --> 41:33.679
You came.

41:33.757 --> 41:36.521
Oh, of course, Eli.
This is my fiancé, Scott.

41:38.195 --> 41:40.857
- Hi.
- I told you I believed you.

41:43.434 --> 41:44.924
Oh, my God.

41:55.079 --> 41:58.048
That guy, I guess
he wasn't so crazy after all.

41:58.148 --> 42:00.048
I guess not.
