18:10.957 --> 18:12.690
Hey.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.091
Dad, I thought
you were in bed.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.526
No, I went down
to the club.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.461
I punched that guy Clark
right in the face.

18:17.463 --> 18:18.796
Oh, God, really?

18:18.798 --> 18:20.564
Bang, zow,
there was blood everywhere.

18:20.566 --> 18:22.232
If the cops stop by...

18:22.234 --> 18:24.501
tell them I was with you
all night, all right?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.471
Eve, I talked to him.

18:27.473 --> 18:30.074
What's going on?
He said you were great.

18:30.076 --> 18:33.811
Just because I'm good at it
doesn't mean I enjoy it, Dad.

18:33.813 --> 18:36.981
Like Eastwood,
who was always haunted

18:36.983 --> 18:38.716
by all the guys
he'd killed,

18:38.718 --> 18:40.084
but he can't stop killing

18:40.086 --> 18:42.086
because no one can do
what he does.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.487
Which Eastwood movie
is that?

18:43.489 --> 18:45.089
All of them.

18:45.091 --> 18:47.858
Except that piece of crap
about the bridges.

18:49.495 --> 18:50.961
You said
you wrote that song,

18:50.963 --> 18:52.763
you performed it,
and people loved it.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.431
That had to mean something
to you.

18:54.433 --> 18:56.834
Okay, yeah, you're right.

18:56.836 --> 19:00.938
When I was up on stage,
it was -- I don't know.

19:00.940 --> 19:03.273
I've never had a feeling
like that before.

19:03.275 --> 19:05.242
Well, you're looking
for other stuff

19:05.244 --> 19:06.977
that might be important
to you.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.480
I think you have a lead
on something there.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.749
Well, why did I lie?

19:11.751 --> 19:13.117
Because you were scared?

19:13.119 --> 19:16.086
I mean, the things we love
the most and matter the most,

19:16.088 --> 19:17.955
it's kind of scary.

19:17.957 --> 19:19.089
Why do I have a feeling

19:19.091 --> 19:20.958
you're not gonna
let me bail on this?

19:20.960 --> 19:22.493
Listen, it's your life.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.762
But I think we should
be grateful

19:24.764 --> 19:27.631
if we find something
we're passionate about.

19:27.633 --> 19:29.633
But what if I fail?

19:29.635 --> 19:32.436
Honey, you are most certainly
going to fail.

19:33.973 --> 19:37.041
You think a 9% chance of getting
into West Point was tough?

19:37.043 --> 19:40.444
Musicians would kill
for those kinds of odds.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.212
You're saying
I should go for it anyway?

19:42.214 --> 19:44.615
Life is short, kid.
It really is.

19:44.617 --> 19:47.451
I don't think you should run
from stuff that challenges you.

19:47.453 --> 19:51.155
If it scares you, I think
you run right towards it.

19:51.157 --> 19:52.690
I'm pretty scared of music,

19:52.692 --> 19:55.526
so I'm gonna run
right towards it.

19:55.528 --> 19:58.162
Now, you know this advice
does not apply to bears?

19:58.164 --> 19:59.496
Yeah.

19:59.498 --> 20:01.031
-Just checking.
-Yeah.

20:01.033 --> 20:04.068
And you know, kid, your mom
and I support you on this.

20:04.070 --> 20:05.569
Yeah, I know.

20:05.571 --> 20:06.870
Right.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.539
Who moved the Impala?

20:08.541 --> 20:11.575
Eve.

20:11.577 --> 20:13.043
Who moved the Impala?!

20:22.054 --> 20:23.654
Mr. Baxter?

20:23.656 --> 20:24.755
Yeah, did you find it?

20:24.757 --> 20:26.356
Yep!

20:26.358 --> 20:28.058
It was in
Mr. Larabee's attic

20:28.060 --> 20:30.194
next to an old
marching-band uniform.

20:30.196 --> 20:32.329
Yeah,
he never mentioned that.

20:32.331 --> 20:34.364
Listen,
what did Nigel say?

20:34.366 --> 20:35.699
Oh, he's totally into it.

20:35.701 --> 20:37.735
You really think it will be
a good idea for a band,

20:37.737 --> 20:38.902
just drums and a trombone?

20:38.904 --> 20:41.205
Yeah, the world's waiting
for that.

20:41.207 --> 20:44.074
And -- And you'll help us
find a gig?

20:44.076 --> 20:45.175
Yes, I said I would.

20:45.177 --> 20:46.877
You guys practice a lot
in Larabee's garage,

20:46.879 --> 20:47.845
and I'll help you out.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.913
Oh, we will.

20:49.915 --> 20:52.216
I got to tell Eve
about my new band!

20:52.218 --> 20:53.851
Look out, world!

20:53.853 --> 20:55.018
Whoo!

20:58.557 --> 21:01.525
Did Cammy come in here
with my old trombone?

21:01.527 --> 21:03.427
Why, yes, she did.

21:03.429 --> 21:06.196
Good thing you got all those
bees out of your garage,

21:06.198 --> 21:08.365
because she and Nigel
will need a nice place

21:08.367 --> 21:09.767
to practice
their new band.

21:09.769 --> 21:13.570
Why are you doing this
to me, Baxter?

21:13.572 --> 21:16.106
Because I found out it was you
that moved the Impala!
