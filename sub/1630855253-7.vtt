00:20.020 --> 00:21.187
<i>Previously on </i>Manifest…

00:21.271 --> 00:22.439
<i>Major says proceed.</i>

00:22.522 --> 00:23.440
<i>They're using</i>

00:23.523 --> 00:26.317
<i>massive electrical currents</i>
<i>to do experiments on their brains.</i>

00:26.401 --> 00:29.612
<i>My son is channeling the pain</i>
<i>from one of the missing passengers.</i>

00:29.696 --> 00:31.740
It's all about the work for you.

00:31.823 --> 00:35.201
-I loved you.
Vi, I'll always love you.

00:35.785 --> 00:37.871
-Mommy!
-Give me back my daughter!

00:38.496 --> 00:40.874
I just wanted to thank you for saving us.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.209
Anyone would've done the same.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.420
I don't know if the people I hurt
will forgive me.

00:45.503 --> 00:46.880
It's not about them.

00:46.963 --> 00:47.881
It's about you.

00:47.964 --> 00:51.051
And seeing yourself
as someone worthy of being loved.

00:51.134 --> 00:54.888
We might just be on the brink of changing
the very definition of science

00:54.971 --> 00:56.139
as we know it.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.475
It might very well be the signature of…

00:58.558 --> 00:59.642
The divine?

01:21.498 --> 01:23.583
Did I pass out?

01:27.921 --> 01:30.298
After you insisted
you weren't gonna go back inside.

01:30.381 --> 01:31.966
-But, Cal, we--
-Don't.

01:34.177 --> 01:37.222
We need to get you to a doctor.
You look like hell.

01:38.389 --> 01:39.682
You're one to talk.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.060
I can smell the alcohol
on your breath from here.

01:43.728 --> 01:46.314
You collapsed. This is serious.

01:47.524 --> 01:48.942
-It could be--
-Anything.

01:49.442 --> 01:52.278
It could be the flu, for all we know.
Don't worry about it.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.489
I can sense you're worried about it.

01:56.991 --> 01:59.744
Why don't we get your dad
and have Saanvi run some tests?

01:59.828 --> 02:03.456
I am not telling my family.
And Saanvi's practically family.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.792
Besides, she has enough
on her plate already.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.752
-She'd make room.
-I said no!

02:13.299 --> 02:17.053
They are just starting to pull themselves
together again with Eden home.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.640
Last thing they need is for me
to stress them out all over again,

02:20.723 --> 02:23.518
especially over something
that could be nothing.

02:24.602 --> 02:28.106
Fine. What If I can get you
to somebody who isn't family?

02:31.359 --> 02:33.153
I need that address.
Let's pick up the pace.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.571
Yeah, I got this right here.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.906
Homicide on line 2.
Where's the captain?

02:36.990 --> 02:39.200
Just grab Thompson.
We need to get a team together.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.243
Okay. Okay.

02:41.619 --> 02:42.996
What the hell is going on?

02:43.079 --> 02:45.540
Another passenger was murdered. Anna Ross.

02:46.040 --> 02:49.752
That's another 828er in 24 hours.
They don't think that Colvin…

02:49.836 --> 02:51.880
No, he's cleared for everything
but extortion.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.965
Okay, so what's the plan?

02:54.048 --> 02:57.343
Registry is all over this.
Already combing Anna's house for clues.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.304
No, I mean,
what is the plan with the passengers?

02:59.387 --> 03:01.514
Why is there not a cop
at every 828er's door?

03:01.598 --> 03:03.850
That's the first thing
I suggested to the new boss.

03:03.933 --> 03:04.851
I'm not the enemy here.

03:04.934 --> 03:06.186
I know. I'm sorry. Just…

03:06.895 --> 03:09.397
Look. I had another Calling.
There was blood pouring down a red X.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.441
I don't think this killer
is close to being done.

03:11.524 --> 03:14.110
All right. I'll talk to the captain
and see what I can do. Okay?

03:14.194 --> 03:16.738
-But in the meantime--
-Steer clear of Anna's. Got it.

03:30.835 --> 03:33.504
Saanvi, the sun is barely up.
What time did you get in?

03:33.588 --> 03:36.591
I never left. I was going over
Cal's scar sample results.

03:36.674 --> 03:38.927
And it turns out it's regular tissue.
Then Olive ca--

03:39.010 --> 03:42.764
Saanvi, you are gonna burn out
if you don't take some time for yourself.

03:42.847 --> 03:47.393
Get this. Sapphire may be the antenna
that tunes us in to divine consciousness.

03:48.311 --> 03:53.733
Sapphire, like on the tail fin
and the driftwood from Noah's Ark.

03:53.816 --> 03:56.653
All I need is to get my hands
on some sapphire.

03:56.736 --> 03:59.906
Hold on a second.
What you need is to take care of yourself.

03:59.989 --> 04:02.575
Vance, I am.

04:03.326 --> 04:06.287
Don't you see? There may be a way
for passengers after all.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.831
A way for us to make it past 2024.

04:12.877 --> 04:15.129
Of course you'll make it.
It's your father's 60th.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.714
Oh my God! You're not listening to me!

04:16.798 --> 04:20.260
There is no point
in buying me a plane ticket

04:20.343 --> 04:24.764
or talking about anything
past June 2nd, 2024

04:24.847 --> 04:26.224
because I will be dead.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.978
We already lost you once.
I will not hear this again!

04:32.522 --> 04:34.399
She just doesn't understand.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.860
Of course she does.
She just doesn't want to.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.279
Neither of us do.

04:39.362 --> 04:40.571
Well, neither do I.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.617
I would do anything for more time.

04:45.410 --> 04:48.997
So why don't you?
Surely there must be somebody at the lab.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.707
What lab, Dad?

04:50.790 --> 04:53.835
After the plane disappeared,
the government shut it all down.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.796
Then what about that nice man I met?

04:56.879 --> 04:59.299
Vance? I haven't heard from him.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.926
And your friend, the doctor? Alex?

05:05.346 --> 05:09.684
There's no way to right the Lifeboat.
Passengers keep doing awful things.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.188
Keep killing innocent people.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.692
Maybe it's not about
righting the Lifeboat.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.235
Maybe it's about

05:20.820 --> 05:22.238
finding another way.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.079
Okay.

05:31.497 --> 05:34.125
Everything's been processed
under your pseudonym.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.794
Even put "Gabriel" down on your lab work.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.004
Thank you for that.

05:38.087 --> 05:39.714
And for seeing us on no notice.

05:39.797 --> 05:42.258
Anything for friends of Dr. Bahl.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.220
So, Gabriel…

05:47.680 --> 05:50.892
the CBC test results
will take a few more hours.

05:50.975 --> 05:55.646
From there, you may need to come in
for a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy

05:55.730 --> 05:58.441
to get the most accurate diagnosis.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.401
Okay, but…

06:00.985 --> 06:03.780
But your condition
appears to be consistent

06:03.863 --> 06:06.324
with falling out of remission.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.121
Meaning my cancer's back.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.708
Until the results come in,
I can't say for certain.

06:16.834 --> 06:18.086
I know it's hard.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.964
Try and focus on something else today.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.425
Find a way to take your mind off all this.

06:26.594 --> 06:27.762
And do what?

06:29.514 --> 06:30.681
Live your life.

06:38.606 --> 06:39.857
Hey, sweetie.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.734
-You wanna draw on this?
-No!

06:44.654 --> 06:45.863
Chin up, kiddo.

06:46.864 --> 06:49.367
You didn't like me hovering
when you were building Lincoln Logs.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.411
-Not at first, but I came around.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.458
Hey, you still stuck in there?

06:58.126 --> 07:01.170
Ben, Anna Ross was murdered.

07:03.214 --> 07:07.343
-What? She was just at the house.
-I know. That's why I'm calling you.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.304
Jared's gonna meet me at Sam's
to see if there's something we've missed,

07:11.764 --> 07:14.100
but two 828 murders, that's not random,

07:14.684 --> 07:16.686
unless there's some connection
between Sam and Anna.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.105
I hope so, for all our sakes.

07:19.188 --> 07:22.859
Okay, uh, I will be in touch.
But until then, hunker down. Cal too.

07:22.942 --> 07:23.818
Yeah.

07:26.737 --> 07:27.780
Cal?

07:29.907 --> 07:30.908
Hey, Cal?

07:37.665 --> 07:40.209
<i>Hi, it's Gabriel. Please leave a message.</i>

07:41.002 --> 07:44.630
Oh, there you are. Thank God.
Thank God you're all right.

07:44.714 --> 07:45.965
Why wouldn't I be?

07:47.508 --> 07:49.886
Look, I'm sorry
I yelled at you last night.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.262
Did something happen?

07:52.305 --> 07:53.222
Anna Ross was murdered.

07:53.806 --> 07:54.849
Oh my God.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.184
Someone's killing 828ers.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.895
Can't have anything happen,
which is why you gotta lay low.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.396
-No leaving the house.
-Wait. What?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.856
No one even knows who I am.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.357
Angelina does.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.526
Who's she gonna tell?
The police? They'll arrest her.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.737
Cal, It's nonnegotiable.
Your life could be in danger.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.363
Yeah, some life.

08:10.239 --> 08:11.240
Cal.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.412
He's got a lot on his mind.

08:40.853 --> 08:41.979
Are those letters?

08:42.063 --> 08:42.897
Huh.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.566
A little young to be spelling.

08:49.654 --> 08:52.406
I don't think she's spelling, Dad.
I think she's having a Calling.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.700
Well, don't look at me. Go figure it out.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.870
-What? Now? I just told Cal to lay low.
-Eden needs your help.

08:57.954 --> 09:01.624
She can't follow a Calling,
but you can follow it for her.

09:04.585 --> 09:07.588
Maybe it could be something
that could help us catch this killer.

09:12.468 --> 09:13.844
All right, you sure you don't mind?

09:13.928 --> 09:15.763
And spend time
with my granddaughter

09:15.846 --> 09:17.348
I haven't seen in two years?

09:17.431 --> 09:18.641
I'm positive.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.477
All right. Don't worry, peanut.

09:22.144 --> 09:24.105
Gonna figure this out for the both of us.

09:27.358 --> 09:28.359
Dad,

09:29.151 --> 09:30.486
lock the door behind me.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.494
Hey, I got your message.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.580
Hey, um,
thanks for coming on your day off.

10:22.663 --> 10:25.374
Of course. Two passenger killings
in the last 24 hours?

10:25.458 --> 10:28.252
It's not a coincidence, agreed.
But why these two?

10:29.420 --> 10:31.547
I don't know. I doubt
we're gonna find any answers here.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.091
Between us and the Registry,
this place has been combed through.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.594
Okay, we gotta comb again.
There's gotta be something in there.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.512
Um, hello?

10:38.596 --> 10:41.641
Oh, it's okay.
It's all right. We're police.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.100
Did you know Sam?

10:43.601 --> 10:47.730
We weren't besties, but he was nice.
Certainly didn't deserve all the hate.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.982
For being a passenger, or…

10:50.608 --> 10:53.027
Those anti-828 people are no joke.

10:53.110 --> 10:55.279
Stalking? Vandalism?

10:55.363 --> 10:57.531
Like a Kim K robbery-level stalking.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.533
Even cost me a babysitting gig.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.328
Sam didn't have kids though.

11:02.411 --> 11:05.081
Some lady and her daughter
were staying with him last year.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.999
I offered to sit, but they took off.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.001
I think the fear got to them.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.753
Is this the kid?

11:18.886 --> 11:20.888
Hey, yeah, I found the connection.

11:20.971 --> 11:23.557
<i>Anna and Sam both took in Angelina</i>
<i>at some point.</i>

11:23.641 --> 11:26.018
-So much for steering clear.
<i>Did you just hear me?</i>

11:26.102 --> 11:28.020
Angelina could be out there
on some revenge spree

11:28.104 --> 11:31.315
against anyone who helped her,
or, I don't know, didn't help her enough.

11:31.399 --> 11:35.569
Well, I could tell you where she's not.
Her psycho mom's place in Westchester.

11:36.737 --> 11:37.988
Noelle's in New York?

11:38.072 --> 11:39.865
Yeah, Registry got a tip.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.701
Tossed the place. No sign of Angelina.

11:41.784 --> 11:45.121
Well, maybe we poke the hornet's nest
a little more, see what we can stir up.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.080
Mick.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.124
Look. I might find something
that your guys missed.

11:48.207 --> 11:51.711
If Noelle can help me get closer
to Angelina, to just ending this, then…

11:51.794 --> 11:53.838
Okay. Yeah, I'll send you the address.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.506
<i>Just, please, with everything going on,</i>

11:55.589 --> 11:56.716
be careful.

11:56.799 --> 11:57.883
<i>Yes. Thanks.</i>

12:01.595 --> 12:03.597
Explain to me again
why you think it's a good idea

12:03.681 --> 12:06.308
to tear apart a $10,000 laser.

12:06.392 --> 12:09.186
Because lasers use high-grade sapphire
in their lenses.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.772
And right now,
this lens is all that we've got.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.608
This is a loaner.
Last thing I need is for you to break…

12:15.359 --> 12:16.193
that.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.320
For you to break that.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.074
-Tell me this wasn't worth it.
-It wasn't worth it.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.702
You just spent $10,000 on an antenna.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.370
It's not any antenna.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.291
Instead of waiting for the Callings
to come to us…

12:30.374 --> 12:32.585
You tune into them?

12:32.668 --> 12:37.006
Yes. We'd have an all-access pass
to unlimited Callings.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.342
All right. Maybe this was worth it.

12:41.677 --> 12:44.388
Now all I need is an instruction manual.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.438
Where you going? Why is your shirt ironed?

12:52.521 --> 12:55.024
Well, 'cause I'm following
doctor's orders.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.902
I was told to do anything
other than wait for bad news,

12:57.985 --> 12:59.612
so I'm going out.

12:59.695 --> 13:02.198
Look, I feel for you, sometimes literally,

13:02.281 --> 13:04.366
but your dad was pretty explicit.

13:04.909 --> 13:05.951
Zeke,

13:06.786 --> 13:10.873
for once in my extremely shortened life,
I'm gonna live.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.153
Can you please hold? Okay, thanks.

13:41.695 --> 13:43.155
May I help you?

13:43.239 --> 13:46.075
I hope so.
I'm looking for a place for my father.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.160
He's… He needs help.

13:48.786 --> 13:49.787
One minute, he's with us.

13:49.870 --> 13:52.873
The next, he's dragging me off
to the 500 Club to see Frank Sinatra.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.835
I mean, we're pretty short-staffed.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.837
I don't know
if there's anyone around that can--

13:57.920 --> 14:02.299
Please. I'll show myself around.
I can't manage him by myself anymore.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.259
-Yeah.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.635
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

14:04.718 --> 14:06.762
Okay, just a quick look around.

14:06.846 --> 14:07.805
All right.

14:08.472 --> 14:10.766
And don't disturb any of our clients.

14:10.850 --> 14:11.851
Sure.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.019
Hello, ALNI.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.313
Yes.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.357
Okay.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.359
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

14:21.026 --> 14:24.405
You have some nerve thinking you can
flash your badge and barge in.

14:24.488 --> 14:27.449
The police were already here,
demolishing my home.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.996
Do you know what your partner did to me?
She abducted my child.

14:32.079 --> 14:34.707
Actually, it sounds like
she saved your child from you.

14:34.790 --> 14:38.878
How dare you! The only person Angelina
needed saving from was herself.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.838
I bet she did kill those people.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.007
And if that is anyone's fault,
that's yours.

14:43.924 --> 14:47.303
I tried to protect the world
from my fallen angel,

14:47.386 --> 14:50.347
and I was doing a fine job of it
until you took her away.

14:51.181 --> 14:54.059
So you're telling me the last time
you saw your daughter was in Costa Rica?

14:54.143 --> 14:58.355
The only person I would want in my home
less than you is her.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.029
Wow! You believe all that?

15:05.112 --> 15:06.071
Not a word.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.574
-She certainly doesn't like you.
-I don't need her to.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.868
If she's not gonna give us proof
that Angelina's involved,

15:10.951 --> 15:12.286
maybe the bodies will.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.114
Reynaldo.

16:32.366 --> 16:33.200
Stone.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.828
I haven't seen you
since you left the force,

16:35.911 --> 16:37.621
which begs the question,

16:38.205 --> 16:39.498
why are you in my morgue?

16:40.082 --> 16:43.460
Two 828ers are dead, and I think
they were killed by the same person.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.005
I also have a feeling
that person's not done.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.589
We have a theory.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.967
But to get this new boss to believe it,
we need proof.

16:52.011 --> 16:52.970
Well,

16:53.679 --> 16:57.266
both victims have identical markings

16:57.349 --> 17:01.103
made in blood
on the palms of their left hand.

17:01.186 --> 17:04.231
So you are correct
in thinking it could be the same killer.

17:05.024 --> 17:08.652
Someone 130-135 pounds minimum.

17:09.361 --> 17:10.612
How do you know that?

17:11.113 --> 17:14.366
The knife was driven so deeply
into each body,

17:14.450 --> 17:17.828
the hilt left bruising,
and that takes real weight.

17:20.205 --> 17:24.168
There goes our proof.
Angelina's 110, tops.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.627
What are you thinking?

17:25.711 --> 17:27.963
I used to think
someone was trying to pin it on an Xer,

17:28.047 --> 17:29.923
but maybe our killer just simply is one.

17:30.507 --> 17:31.717
They were harassing Sam.

17:32.301 --> 17:35.763
Hmm, they clearly know where to find us,
so let's go find one of them.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.770
-Excuse me!
-Oh, I'm sorry. I apologize.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.480
This is, uh… this is my wife.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.567
-Sorry I'm late. Traffic was crazy.
-Don't worry, babe.

17:48.650 --> 17:51.695
Dad's gonna love this place.
Do you mind if we take one more lap?

17:51.779 --> 17:52.863
-Go ahead.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.199
Hello, ALNI.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.619
Okay, what was so important
that I needed to rush over?

17:58.702 --> 17:59.620
Not what.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.456
Who.

18:08.545 --> 18:10.047
The detained passengers.

18:10.923 --> 18:11.882
How?

18:12.716 --> 18:14.384
Eden's Calling led me to them.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.970
Someone must have dumped them here.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.681
Well, we still don't know
what the major did to them or why.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.351
I think Eden sent us here to find out.
The question--

18:24.311 --> 18:26.730
Who the heck are you?
You cannot be in here.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.398
You can't disturb my patients.

18:28.482 --> 18:31.401
Disturb them?
Um, they don't have any brain function.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.571
Wow, cold much? They're still people.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.573
-Let's go.
-You don't understand.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.492
Buddy, don't make me call security.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.494
Okay. Our apologies. We're leaving.

18:44.623 --> 18:47.960
-What? We gotta get back in there.
-Like there's any chance I'd leave now.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.796
Look. I made a promise
to myself a long time ago

18:50.879 --> 18:52.589
that I would never give up on anyone.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.258
Not ever again.

18:58.178 --> 19:00.180
Excuse me. Give me another.

19:10.732 --> 19:12.484
Big night? What you celebrating?

19:14.903 --> 19:15.737
Jumping ship.

19:16.405 --> 19:19.700
I think it's about time
I realized I am getting ghosted.

19:26.915 --> 19:27.749
Um…

19:28.333 --> 19:31.211
Do you mind if I get the check,
like, right now?

19:31.295 --> 19:35.132
You know what? It's on me tonight.
Looks like you could use the win.

19:35.215 --> 19:36.592
You know what I could use?

19:38.844 --> 19:42.264
-A big, dark cave I can just crawl into.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.100
Well, I'm fresh out of those, but

19:46.476 --> 19:48.478
I do have a bed you could crawl into.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.824
What time do you get off?

20:02.701 --> 20:03.952
Uh, Violet?

20:04.036 --> 20:06.330
-Hi.
-Hey, thanks for meeting me.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.373
I would've come to you,
but with my new job…

20:08.457 --> 20:10.959
Oh, don't sweat it. Seriously.
I'm the one that texted you.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.045
Glad you did.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.590
Uh, I've been meaning to return your coat,

20:16.673 --> 20:19.092
but I wasn't sure how to reach
the hero that saved me.

20:19.176 --> 20:22.262
Oh, please. You're the hero.
This is my favorite jacket.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.266
-Uh…

20:27.351 --> 20:28.727
So, um…

20:28.810 --> 20:29.770
So…

20:30.646 --> 20:32.981
what did you have in mind to…

20:33.857 --> 20:35.150
to do?

20:35.234 --> 20:37.402
Unless you just wanted your jacket.

20:37.486 --> 20:38.862
Oh, no. Uh, um…

20:39.655 --> 20:41.114
I'm easy. Whatever you want.

20:41.698 --> 20:43.325
Well, how about I buy you a drink?

20:44.201 --> 20:45.953
The least I could do after everything.

20:47.454 --> 20:49.164
I mean, only if you want to.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.209
Yeah, a drink.

20:52.292 --> 20:53.710
-Uh-huh.

20:53.794 --> 20:56.004
Lead the way. Okay, all right.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.798
For sure.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.164
-Take a look at this.
-Wait.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.208
-You're gonna see what I found.
-I've read enough.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.085
"Enough soft-pedaling
with the 828 passengers."

21:35.168 --> 21:36.920
"Time to treat them
like the vermin they are."

21:37.004 --> 21:39.464
How do you put up with this shit?
All the hate 24/7?

21:39.548 --> 21:41.383
I don't. Just gotta tune out the crazies

21:41.466 --> 21:43.468
and learn to find out
which ones are harmless

21:43.552 --> 21:45.012
and which ones mean business.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.016
-XOUT828?
-Look at his most recent posts.

21:49.099 --> 21:51.685
He has a whole game plan
for wiping out 828ers,

21:51.768 --> 21:54.104
starting with passengers
being marked with blood.

21:54.187 --> 21:55.856
Wait. He said blood specifically,

21:55.939 --> 21:58.608
like how the killer uses blood
to mark an X on the victim's palm?

21:58.692 --> 22:00.444
It's not public information.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.613
I think we're gonna need
a name and address for this XOUT828.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.991
It sounds like
you're gonna need to call Drea.

22:09.202 --> 22:11.413
I thought this was a normal bar.
I can't do this.

22:11.496 --> 22:12.956
Of course you can.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.375
-Well, I'm not good at singing.
-That's what makes it fun.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.627
No one's good.
Haven't you done this before?

22:18.670 --> 22:20.589
You're a karaoke virgin?

22:20.672 --> 22:22.924
-Is that what they're calling it now?

22:23.008 --> 22:26.428
Don't worry. I'll make sure
your first time's one to remember.

22:35.979 --> 22:37.064
Are you kidding me?

22:37.147 --> 22:40.108
Please. I'm a doctor.
One look at their charts.

22:40.192 --> 22:43.028
-That's all we ask. Then we'll go.
-Out of the effing question.

22:43.111 --> 22:44.571
These people were in my care.

22:45.155 --> 22:46.782
Oh yeah? Then what are they doing here?

22:46.865 --> 22:51.620
I don't know, but there could be something
buried in those charts that could help me

22:51.703 --> 22:53.413
help you take care of them.

22:53.497 --> 22:55.499
If you wanna help, leave.

22:55.582 --> 22:58.960
If I violate HIPAA, I get fired, and then
my patients are really out of luck.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.588
I am the only one who cares for them.

23:01.671 --> 23:05.175
The facility doesn't even care
that no one knows who these people are.

23:05.258 --> 23:06.510
We know who they are.

23:08.845 --> 23:10.639
They're Flight 828 passengers.

23:11.306 --> 23:13.100
Okay. I see.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.895
You're some of the folks
that are fascinated by the plane.

23:17.604 --> 23:18.438
Okay.

23:18.522 --> 23:22.442
You're wrong. We're some of those folks
that were on the plane.

23:23.026 --> 23:24.194
Hey!

23:24.694 --> 23:26.863
She's not lying. That's Marlon.

23:26.947 --> 23:30.117
His wife, Joelle. And that's Lena.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.284
And that's…

23:38.208 --> 23:39.042
Marko.

23:39.876 --> 23:40.919
Oh my God.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.382
Marko.

23:50.303 --> 23:52.097
I'll never forget what the major did.

23:53.056 --> 23:56.309
Those horrible experiments.
The connection you had with my son.

24:02.232 --> 24:04.025
Eden led me here for a reason.

24:06.486 --> 24:07.654
To remember.

24:10.198 --> 24:12.534
It's not good enough to help myself.
I have to help.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.077
All of us.

24:25.088 --> 24:27.299
Forgive me, Marko.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.552
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

24:35.932 --> 24:37.100
That can't be.

24:37.976 --> 24:38.810
What did you do?

24:40.604 --> 24:42.772
I asked for his forgiveness.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.275
Well, I think he gave it to you.

24:46.234 --> 24:50.363
He's conscious. I think these passengers
do have function. They're awake.

24:51.656 --> 24:54.326
Five minutes with their records.
If I can get inside their minds,

24:54.409 --> 24:56.953
imagine the type of care
you could provide for them.

24:58.580 --> 24:59.873
Five minutes, but that is all.

24:59.956 --> 25:02.918
-Anyone catches wind of what we're doing--
-They won't. We'll be in and out.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.044
Just one of you.

25:04.836 --> 25:07.881
Go. I'll stay here.
I wanna spend some time with these guys.

25:16.223 --> 25:19.142
All right, so apparently our guy XOUT828,
AKA Greg Turner,

25:19.226 --> 25:21.144
isn't allowed
within 50 feet of any passenger.

25:21.228 --> 25:24.648
You really think an Xer is gonna behave
based on a piece of paper?

25:25.148 --> 25:26.650
There's only one way to find out.

25:27.484 --> 25:28.485
We wait.

25:31.196 --> 25:34.741
Figured it was gonna be a long day.
And, yes, before you ask,

25:34.824 --> 25:36.535
there is extra avocado.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.995
Yeah, I'm not making that mistake twice.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.373
Yeah, there it is. Good job.

25:43.583 --> 25:44.543
There's our guy.

25:57.013 --> 25:58.181
Thanks for coming.

25:59.224 --> 26:02.435
I've written all this down for Cal,
but it bears repeating.

26:02.519 --> 26:05.689
This is a powerful opioid for the pain.

26:05.772 --> 26:08.149
No more than two of these every 12 hours.

26:08.233 --> 26:12.529
Now, we aren't there yet,
but if Cal does end up needing chemo,

26:12.612 --> 26:14.281
he has to stop taking those.

26:14.364 --> 26:15.824
They can mask high temperatures.

26:15.907 --> 26:18.660
His doctor will need to know
if he has a fever.

26:19.160 --> 26:23.123
I can't hold on to these.
I'm all of 18 hours sober.

26:31.798 --> 26:34.134
I've been so focused
on making others' pain go away,

26:34.217 --> 26:35.385
I forgot about me.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.053
My pain.

26:39.723 --> 26:42.350
And now I have no room left to process it.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.398
I haven't even told my wife
I relapsed yet.

26:49.649 --> 26:51.860
Sorry. It's the first time
I'm saying this out loud.

26:55.655 --> 26:57.073
I don't know what to do.

26:58.366 --> 27:00.201
I know the truth will hurt her.

27:01.620 --> 27:04.873
-But if she finds I kept this secret--
-It'll hurt her even more.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.792
It's the nature of secrets.

27:10.420 --> 27:11.338
You've been there.

27:11.838 --> 27:14.049
I have so been there.

27:17.052 --> 27:20.639
I can't believe this is the first time
I'm saying this out loud.

27:20.722 --> 27:27.520
But… on the day 828 was supposed to land,

27:28.605 --> 27:30.231
I was at JFK

27:31.483 --> 27:33.151
waiting for Saanvi.

27:35.862 --> 27:38.782
Secrecy breeds pain, Zeke.

27:39.282 --> 27:43.745
Promise me you'll love yourself enough
to make room for it.

27:51.544 --> 27:55.173
Whoa! Talk about a deep cut.
Is this from when we were gone?

27:55.256 --> 27:58.510
Try 20 years before we existed.
It's my mom's favorite.

28:43.805 --> 28:45.390
Keep going. You're crushing it.

28:51.396 --> 28:52.272
What?

28:52.897 --> 28:54.399
-What?
What?

28:54.482 --> 28:56.025
-Nothing. I just…

28:56.109 --> 28:58.111
This is nice, is all.

28:58.194 --> 29:00.029
It's been a while
since I felt like the real me.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.030
Mm.

29:01.114 --> 29:02.615
-Mysterious.
-Hmm.

29:02.699 --> 29:06.244
Okay. Go on, then. Who are you really?

29:08.371 --> 29:09.706
Uh, that's just it.

29:12.292 --> 29:15.462
I'm actually… Cal.

29:16.463 --> 29:17.464
Cal Stone.

29:18.757 --> 29:22.051
Cal Stone, the runaway?

29:23.178 --> 29:24.804
But I thought he was…

29:24.888 --> 29:25.805
Younger?

29:26.306 --> 29:27.390
Yeah.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.851
Hard to explain, but it's me.

29:30.602 --> 29:32.687
So that little girl from the compound is--

29:32.771 --> 29:34.230
My sister Eden.

29:36.524 --> 29:37.442
Oh my God.

29:37.525 --> 29:42.447
I'm sorry. I should have told you sooner.
I totally get if you hate me right now.

29:42.530 --> 29:45.158
Hate you? You're gonna hate me.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.165
That lady, Angelina.

29:53.500 --> 29:59.088
I helped her, like, a year ago
with books and diapers and stuff.

29:59.172 --> 30:00.632
I worked at a day care.

30:01.424 --> 30:02.550
So I hooked her up.

30:03.134 --> 30:05.094
I even let her crash there after hours.

30:05.178 --> 30:07.889
I had no idea who she was
or what she had done,

30:07.972 --> 30:11.851
but after seeing that little girl
reunite with her dad, with…

30:12.977 --> 30:14.103
with your dad…

30:15.271 --> 30:17.357
If only I had told someone sooner.

30:18.233 --> 30:21.611
No. Angelina had us all fooled.

30:21.694 --> 30:23.154
You are a good person.

30:23.738 --> 30:27.492
And after everything you've been through,
you can't. You just…

30:53.935 --> 30:54.769
Here.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.188
No, it's all right.
My house is just down the block.

30:57.814 --> 31:01.234
Please. You're freezing out here.
Besides, it looks better on you anyway.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.783
Who said chivalry was dead?

31:11.786 --> 31:14.747
Wanna come over?
I make an amazing Pop-Tart.

31:16.332 --> 31:18.501
I… I should… I should really get back,

31:19.419 --> 31:21.421
but maybe on our next date.

31:21.504 --> 31:24.549
Oh, you thought this was a date?

31:48.031 --> 31:49.699
You're dangerous, Gabriel.

32:06.174 --> 32:08.927
Should be somewhere
against the back wall. I'll keep watch.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.419
I don't understand.
I saw you crying. You're conscious.

32:43.503 --> 32:45.254
How can you not have any neural activity?

33:18.746 --> 33:22.583
Hey, space cadet. We gotta go, now.
My boss is starting rounds.

33:23.918 --> 33:25.712
Did you find something that can help them?

33:25.795 --> 33:28.464
I think I found something
that can help all of us.

34:25.229 --> 34:27.690
That guy isn't allowed
within 50 feet of a passenger's home.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.400
What does he do? Shows up at one.

34:29.901 --> 34:33.946
Okay, according to Ben's database,
this is Chris Levins's house. Seat 15B.

34:36.032 --> 34:36.908
Someone's home.

34:43.664 --> 34:44.665
Drop it!

34:45.875 --> 34:46.751
Where's the knife?

34:46.834 --> 34:48.086
The hell? What knife?

34:53.216 --> 34:56.177
-He's not our guy.
-What? He's outside a passenger's house.

34:56.260 --> 34:57.178
He's not the killer.

34:57.261 --> 34:59.514
Killer? What are you talking about?
Get the hell off of me!

34:59.597 --> 35:01.766
Relax, man! We're not trying to hurt you!

35:01.849 --> 35:04.852
There's a text from Drea. Someone just
stabbed a third passenger to death.

35:06.813 --> 35:08.523
Wait.
So the serial killer's still out there.

35:09.315 --> 35:10.358
Hunting us.

35:15.154 --> 35:19.534
I'm telling you, a giant light
leaped from Marko's brain scan.

35:20.409 --> 35:21.619
Proving he's conscious?

35:21.702 --> 35:24.372
Well, we saw him cry.
We already knew he was conscious.

35:26.457 --> 35:29.168
Why get a Calling
confirming what you already knew?

35:30.128 --> 35:33.506
That's the thing. I feel like the Calling
wasn't trying to tell me that.

35:34.340 --> 35:37.301
It wasn't only Marko's.
All nine of them lit up.

35:39.428 --> 35:40.805
And the beam wasn't just a light.

35:40.888 --> 35:42.765
It was pointing straight up
like an antenna.

35:44.225 --> 35:46.102
Like an antenna to the glow.

35:46.185 --> 35:47.311
Yeah, but that would mean…

35:47.395 --> 35:49.730
These people have a direct channel
to divine consciousness.

35:50.898 --> 35:52.483
How is that even possible?

35:56.237 --> 35:58.739
The goal was never to save people.

35:58.823 --> 36:01.784
What's the point of a powerful mutation

36:01.868 --> 36:05.663
if you can't replicate and weaponize it?

36:07.165 --> 36:08.166
The major.

36:08.791 --> 36:09.876
She did this to them.

36:10.543 --> 36:12.253
Of course she did. The torture. The--

36:12.336 --> 36:14.964
Forget torture for a second.
She figured out a way

36:15.047 --> 36:17.258
to tune the detainees
into the God frequency.

36:17.341 --> 36:22.180
I mean, if I could replicate that,
maybe create our own antenna…

36:22.263 --> 36:24.307
Saanvi, stop.
What the major did was awful.

36:24.390 --> 36:26.017
Look what happened to Marko,
to all those--

36:26.100 --> 36:28.686
I'd never do that to anyone.
But if I could figure out

36:28.769 --> 36:31.898
how the major did this, I would know
both what to do and what not to do,

36:31.981 --> 36:35.359
and maybe, just maybe, we can figure out
how to survive our Death Date.

36:36.152 --> 36:37.945
A direct link to divine consciousness?

36:38.029 --> 36:40.031
Yes, without getting anyone stuck there.

36:41.866 --> 36:45.745
I mean, Ben, if our Callings aren't enough
to keep the Lifeboat afloat,

36:45.828 --> 36:47.205
this is our other way.

36:48.331 --> 36:49.373
Eden, her…

36:51.000 --> 36:52.793
her Calling led us to this.

36:54.337 --> 36:55.922
She's a chip off the old block.

36:58.257 --> 36:59.091
Thank you.

37:01.052 --> 37:04.513
I know I haven't always been there.
But like you said, you never gave up.

37:04.597 --> 37:06.599
Not on the passengers. Not on me.

37:06.682 --> 37:07.850
It's okay.

37:16.108 --> 37:16.943
What?

37:34.043 --> 37:35.544
Welcome back, friend.

37:35.628 --> 37:37.171
We're about to get started.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.589
Oh, thank you, man.

37:38.673 --> 37:39.507
There you go.

37:39.590 --> 37:40.633
Hey, thanks.

37:43.135 --> 37:44.512
Feel like starting off?

37:46.973 --> 37:47.807
Sure.

37:50.685 --> 37:52.103
My name is Zeke.

37:52.937 --> 37:55.398
And as of today, I'm one day sober.

38:05.616 --> 38:08.035
-Did you find what you were looking for?

38:28.306 --> 38:29.557
Daddy.

38:30.308 --> 38:33.144
Well, I'd say so.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.322
How did you know to send me there?

38:45.072 --> 38:47.325
And how did that Calling
get in your little head?

38:49.827 --> 38:50.661
Well…

38:52.538 --> 38:54.957
however it happened, thank you.

38:56.417 --> 38:59.211
You reminded me
that we're all in the same lifeboat…

39:02.089 --> 39:05.468
and that I just might get the chance
to watch you grow up.

39:16.062 --> 39:17.897
This is a sight for sore eyes.

39:19.857 --> 39:21.233
All good things, Mick.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.365
All good things.

39:37.375 --> 39:40.211
Hey, Jared Vasquez from 129.
Do me a solid. Process this guy.

39:40.294 --> 39:41.170
No time.

39:41.253 --> 39:44.465
Make time. He's an Xer
in violation of his court order.

39:48.260 --> 39:50.262
Yep, all right, pal. Let's go.

39:56.769 --> 39:57.728
Hey.

39:59.021 --> 40:00.106
We got a problem.

40:02.900 --> 40:06.112
That's all of them.
But so far, no mention of sapphire.

40:06.195 --> 40:10.157
I don't understand. How could the major
tap into the God frequency without it?

40:10.241 --> 40:12.326
You might want to ask Aria Gupta.

40:12.910 --> 40:15.454
Dr. Gupta. Why would I talk to her
about the detainees?

40:15.538 --> 40:18.958
Seems our old friend
conducted their intake exams.

40:19.750 --> 40:20.751
What?

40:24.505 --> 40:25.714
Why didn't she tell us?

40:25.798 --> 40:30.094
Well, if she was an accessory to torture,
it's not exactly something you brag about.

40:31.137 --> 40:34.890
You know, maybe she doesn't understand
what the major accomplished.

40:34.974 --> 40:36.809
Okay, well, there's
only one way to find out.

40:36.892 --> 40:38.227
We gotta go talk to her.

40:39.979 --> 40:42.022
We're this close to figuring it out.

40:44.316 --> 40:45.693
A chance for more time.

42:15.366 --> 42:16.283
You all right?

42:18.827 --> 42:21.163
Three of us are dead
and no clue what's next.

42:21.664 --> 42:22.748
What do you think?

42:23.415 --> 42:25.584
I think you don't need to go it alone.

42:26.835 --> 42:29.547
Marko made me realize
how asleep at the wheel I've been.

42:29.630 --> 42:32.174
Ben, you weren't asleep.
You were living a nightmare.

42:33.509 --> 42:35.052
But if you wanna help, I'll take it.

42:38.347 --> 42:39.473
Why did I see a bloody X

42:39.557 --> 42:42.434
if it's not gonna lead me
towards the killer or the next victim?

42:42.518 --> 42:45.771
Well, maybe there's more to your Calling
than meets the eye.

42:45.854 --> 42:47.898
Let's start from the top.

42:56.490 --> 43:00.119
I don't know, Ben. The X you drew, there's
something not quite right about it.

43:00.202 --> 43:01.662
I don't know. It's just… It's too…

43:02.454 --> 43:04.331
Maybe we're looking at it the wrong way.

43:14.216 --> 43:15.884
That's not an X. That's a cross.

43:17.761 --> 43:19.805
The Calling,
it <i>was </i>leading me to the killer.

43:19.888 --> 43:21.932
I was at the right house,
looking at the wrong person.

43:22.016 --> 43:24.101
I know who it is.
I know who the murderer is.

43:32.318 --> 43:34.570
-What the hell, J? You scared us.
-Where is Cal?

43:34.653 --> 43:36.280
Cal? Where is he?

43:36.363 --> 43:38.949
-Whoa. What's up?
-I need to see Cal. Where is he?

43:39.450 --> 43:40.492
I'm here.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.537
Talk to us, Jared. What's happening?

43:43.621 --> 43:45.289
The Registry thinks they found the killer.

43:46.165 --> 43:47.499
It's Noelle, right?

43:47.583 --> 43:49.251
Jared, tell me it's Noelle.

43:50.252 --> 43:53.088
Why are you looking at me?
I don't even know who's dead.

43:55.215 --> 43:56.050
What's this?

43:56.133 --> 43:59.386
This… this is the last image
the Registry has of the suspect

43:59.470 --> 44:02.640
before he walks out of frame,
away from the victim.

44:03.265 --> 44:04.266
Victim?

44:07.186 --> 44:08.228
No.

44:08.812 --> 44:11.565
No. She can't be. I was just with her.

44:11.649 --> 44:13.817
With who? Can someone tell me
what the hell's happening?

44:13.901 --> 44:16.195
What's happening is
Gabriel Stone's about to be arrested

44:16.278 --> 44:17.571
for the murder of Violet Wheeler.

44:17.655 --> 44:20.282
Jared, this has gotta be
some kind of joke.

44:20.366 --> 44:22.076
Cal didn't leave the house tonight.

44:22.159 --> 44:23.369
I didn't say he did.

44:23.452 --> 44:26.830
The Registry doesn't know about Cal.
They think Gabriel's the killer.

44:27.373 --> 44:28.457
Where were you?

44:29.375 --> 44:30.209
Cal!

44:30.292 --> 44:31.710
It doesn't matter where he was.

44:31.794 --> 44:34.922
What matters is where he'll go.
Cal needs to run, now.
