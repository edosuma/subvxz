00:01.036 --> 00:02.737
Well, here it is.
My last tip.

00:02.738 --> 00:04.138
Only $2.

00:04.389 --> 00:05.756
And to think,
I held in a fart

00:05.757 --> 00:07.891

00:07.892 --> 00:09.593
This night sucks.

00:09.594 --> 00:10.761
We don't even have enough

00:10.762 --> 00:12.363
to buy supplies
for tomorrow.

00:12.364 --> 00:13.597
We'll just have to go
to that store

00:13.598 --> 00:16.634
where everything's free.

00:16.635 --> 00:19.637
Oh, good.
They're open.

00:19.638 --> 00:20.971
And we have to sneak
all this stuff out.

00:20.972 --> 00:22.906
Han's staying late
to do inventory.

00:22.907 --> 00:25.976
Damn it, why does he always
have to be so Asian?

00:25.977 --> 00:27.611
Let's see, what do we need
for our cupcake shop?

00:27.612 --> 00:30.381
Eggs, sugar--
A stripper pole?

00:30.382 --> 00:32.415
Do you want to make money
or not?

00:32.417 --> 00:34.218
How are we gonna hide
these eggs?

00:34.219 --> 00:36.220
You could put some of those
"Grade A large"

00:36.221 --> 00:38.489
where there's
"Grade A itty-bitties."

00:38.490 --> 00:41.592
Rude,
but I don't hate it.

00:41.593 --> 00:44.228
I can probably fit
four to six in each.

00:44.229 --> 00:45.729
So positive!

00:45.730 --> 00:49.033
I love that you're a "cup's
half full" kind of person.

00:53.271 --> 00:55.005
So come here often?

00:55.906 --> 00:57.841
This is my first time.

00:57.842 --> 01:00.644
- Well, you're very pretty.
- Oh, thank you.

01:00.645 --> 01:03.013
Heads up.
Han's coming your way.

01:03.014 --> 01:04.647
Should I fake a stroke?

01:04.649 --> 01:07.384
And P.S., if I don't get up
in three minutes,

01:07.385 --> 01:09.286
it's a real one.

01:09.287 --> 01:10.988
No,
I'll deal with him.

01:10.989 --> 01:12.358
You keep going.

01:18.697 --> 01:20.130
Keep it up,
and we'll finally have

01:20.131 --> 01:22.466
an answer to the question
"What comes first?

a "666"

No, what I found is a site
where we can apply

02:05.580 --> 02:06.980
for a small business grant.

There's also
a minority-owned category.

You don't know
who your father is,

Any chance he could be

Yes, in fact,
I think his name

02:22.463 --> 02:24.698
was Chief Running Away.

another start-up business.

of a recommendation

from Candy Andy's

I've already written it,

I can't, he's my ex.

- For lunch?
- Forever.

09:25.386 --> 09:26.886
a big hunk of cheese
in a trough

09:26.887 --> 09:30.220
and let all the village girls
just go at it.

09:31.459 --> 09:32.692
Sorry, Sophie.

09:32.693 --> 09:34.394
It just seemed like
a better business decision

09:34.395 --> 09:35.996
to go with the forgery.

09:35.997 --> 09:37.964
What is that?

09:38.465 --> 09:40.700
[Gasps]
Is that a waffle?

09:40.701 --> 09:42.034
[Laughs]

09:42.201 --> 09:44.034
Okay!
You are forgiven.

09:45.439 --> 09:47.741
Damn it.
I didn't even get a bite.

09:47.742 --> 09:49.643
I'm awake and sober
for nothing.

09:49.644 --> 09:52.245
Sophie, do you believe
in psychics?

09:52.246 --> 09:54.948
Oh, no.
That's all fake.

09:54.949 --> 09:57.117
You know, I knew a family
of gypsy psychics

09:57.118 --> 09:59.085
who couldn't even predict
that they would all die

09:59.086 --> 10:01.321
in a barn fire.

10:01.822 --> 10:04.024
Hey, girls.
Sorry to interrupt,

10:04.025 --> 10:07.160
but Sophie promised
to rub antifungal cream

10:07.161 --> 10:09.729
on my thick,
yellow toenails.

10:09.730 --> 10:11.331
[Mouth full]
Oleg, come over here.

10:11.332 --> 10:14.665
I'll do it in between bites.

10:14.902 --> 10:17.637
This is what you're afraid
you're missing?

10:17.638 --> 10:19.806
Because
this is a relationship.

10:19.807 --> 10:22.442
Seriously, Max.
That's something I really want.

10:22.443 --> 10:25.145
And now
I'm never gonna have it.

10:25.146 --> 10:28.315
Get in there, baby.
I have two feet.

10:29.850 --> 10:31.351
[Bell chimes]

10:31.352 --> 10:32.452
Interesting.

10:32.453 --> 10:34.921
She's a psychic,
but she needs a bell

10:34.922 --> 10:37.257
to tell her someone's here.
[Door closes]

10:37.758 --> 10:39.592
Max, please
don't make me do this.

10:39.593 --> 10:41.761
I don't want to hear
any more bad things.

10:41.762 --> 10:43.630
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

10:43.631 --> 10:44.964
She's gonna tell you
you have

10:44.965 --> 10:46.800
a bright, love-filled future

10:46.801 --> 10:49.969
or I'm gonna kick her
in the crystal balls.

10:49.970 --> 10:51.404
Hello, girls.

10:51.405 --> 10:53.540
I'll tell you your future
as soon as I finish eating.

10:53.541 --> 10:54.941
It'll only take a minute.

10:54.942 --> 10:58.275
Since I quit smoking,
I eat like a prisoner.

10:58.279 --> 11:01.612
Come, sit, ruminate
on your wishes and dreams.

11:01.982 --> 11:05.315
Well, my wish is that you give
my friend her money back,

11:05.820 --> 11:07.954
and my dream is
that I'm a backup dancer

11:07.955 --> 11:09.723
for Missy Elliott.

11:10.724 --> 11:13.460
Great. A wise-ass.

11:13.461 --> 11:15.562
Do you want to know
your future or not?

11:15.563 --> 11:17.364
Um, you already told me
my future.

11:17.365 --> 11:18.365
That's why we're here.

11:18.366 --> 11:20.066
You said
I'd never find love.

11:20.067 --> 11:22.369
When did I say that?

11:22.370 --> 11:25.538
And you, tough guy, don't say,
"Well, you're the psychic."

11:25.539 --> 11:28.408
Maybe she is a psychic,
because I am a tough guy

11:28.409 --> 11:31.077
and I was gonna say that.

11:31.078 --> 11:32.479
You know,
it's hard to remember.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.714
I see a lot
of sad, single girls.

11:34.715 --> 11:36.049
But looking at you
right now,

11:36.050 --> 11:38.318
it makes sense.

11:38.319 --> 11:41.054
And here.
Take your phony crystal back.

11:41.055 --> 11:43.089
And I'm not so sure
this is a real crystal.

11:43.090 --> 11:46.423
It looks like one of
those vegan deodorant things.

11:46.694 --> 11:48.661
And we want our money.

11:48.662 --> 11:51.030
[Hisses]

11:51.031 --> 11:54.364
Oh, okay.
What just happened?

11:55.169 --> 11:57.637
I put a curse on you.

11:57.638 --> 12:00.340
Max, you said nothing bad
was gonna happen!

12:00.341 --> 12:03.674
Well, I'm not a psychic,
and neither is she.

12:05.211 --> 12:06.246
Laugh, Buster.

12:06.247 --> 12:08.281
Nothing in life
will go your way,

12:08.282 --> 12:10.450
and you will live
under a dark cloud.

12:10.451 --> 12:13.253
[Scoffs]
Will this dark cloud merge

12:13.254 --> 12:15.121
with the current dark cloud
above me

12:15.122 --> 12:17.724
or fly alongside of it?

12:18.425 --> 12:19.959
Look, we don't want
to trouble you,

12:19.960 --> 12:21.594
but if you could
remove the curse

12:21.595 --> 12:24.764
and possibly that noodle
on your blouse...

12:24.765 --> 12:26.833
[Hisses]

12:28.835 --> 12:30.437
Oh, no.
Did you just--

12:30.438 --> 12:32.071
Cursed you too.

12:32.072 --> 12:35.405
Tell you what.
I'll lift both curses for 50,

12:35.609 --> 12:38.411
or else your whole life
will come crashing down

12:38.412 --> 12:40.079
all around you.

12:40.080 --> 12:43.413
The only way I'm giving
a strange woman 50 bucks

12:43.951 --> 12:47.284
is if I'm walking out of here
with a genital piercing.

12:48.489 --> 12:51.558
I do that as well.

12:53.127 --> 12:54.394
[Bell chimes]

12:54.395 --> 12:57.163
Don't believe in curses,
never have.

12:57.164 --> 12:59.165
Not since Jennifer Martin
told me I was going to hell

12:59.166 --> 13:00.567
for sleeping
with her boyfriend.

13:00.568 --> 13:01.768
But I didn't.

13:01.769 --> 13:03.403
I just ended up going
to homecoming with him.

13:03.404 --> 13:05.438
Max, we have to go back
and pay her.

13:05.439 --> 13:06.840
Our lives are hard enough.

13:06.841 --> 13:09.242
We don't need things to come
crashing down around us.

13:09.243 --> 13:12.576
Relax. Nothing's coming
crashing down around us.

13:12.980 --> 13:15.882
Don't jump, Paul!
Paul, don't jump!

13:15.883 --> 13:17.083
Paul? Who's Paul?

13:17.084 --> 13:18.384
Oh.

13:18.385 --> 13:20.353
And what is he doing
on the roof?

13:20.354 --> 13:22.856
[Thud]
[Screams]

13:22.857 --> 13:24.424
Okay.

13:24.425 --> 13:27.327
That was Paul's life
that came crashing down,

13:27.328 --> 13:29.395
not ours.

13:35.673 --> 13:37.423
Max, I think
we all know that

13:37.424 --> 13:38.924
I'm a highly educated woman

13:38.925 --> 13:40.459
who doesn't really believe
in curses,

13:40.460 --> 13:42.361
but I am putting every penny
we make tonight

13:42.362 --> 13:43.729
in the "lift the curse"
fund.

13:43.730 --> 13:46.231
And I'm gonna tell you
one more time,

13:46.232 --> 13:48.300
we're not spending
another 50 bucks

13:48.301 --> 13:49.535
on some stupid curse.

13:49.536 --> 13:52.869
A body fell from the sky!

13:54.373 --> 13:56.491
Paul got a bad batch
of shrooms.

13:56.492 --> 13:58.126
It had nothing to do
with the curse.

13:58.627 --> 14:00.595
Everyone knows
you don't take psychedelics

14:00.596 --> 14:03.298
above the second floor.

14:03.299 --> 14:05.467
Poor amateur bastard.

14:05.468 --> 14:08.637
And we need our money
for essentials, like food

14:08.638 --> 14:11.971
and the penguin statue
I saw at the Dollar Store.

14:11.974 --> 14:15.307
The one that says
"Chill out."

14:15.378 --> 14:17.045
So chill out.

14:17.846 --> 14:19.781
Caroline,
I feel bad

14:19.782 --> 14:22.250
about not signing your letter
of recommendation.

14:22.251 --> 14:24.286
So I wrote one myself
and signed it.

14:24.287 --> 14:25.854
Here.

14:25.855 --> 14:27.622
That's so nice of you.

14:27.623 --> 14:30.625
"The extremely hardworking
Caroline Channing,

14:30.626 --> 14:32.094
"who has devoted her life
to business

14:32.095 --> 14:34.930
and nothing
and no one else."

14:35.431 --> 14:37.766
Han, this is supposed
to be about getting a loan,

14:37.767 --> 14:39.367
not being alone.

14:39.368 --> 14:42.204
I totally get it, girl.
I'm alone as well.

14:42.205 --> 14:45.307
We have our eyes on the prize,
so our beds are empty.

14:45.308 --> 14:48.641
But occasionally,
I pay for it.

14:53.916 --> 14:56.151
Did Han just intimate

14:56.152 --> 14:59.485
that he occasionally
gets a hooker?

14:59.822 --> 15:02.491
Lucky bastard.

15:03.192 --> 15:05.825
He probably gets
a child's discount.

15:08.564 --> 15:11.197
Max, look.
The future's already happening.

15:11.300 --> 15:13.068
Even in Han's letter,
I'm alone.

15:13.069 --> 15:14.903
The only chance for
a love life I have now

15:14.904 --> 15:17.139
is going halfsies on a hooker
with Han.

15:17.140 --> 15:19.608
We have to reverse
the curse now.

15:19.609 --> 15:22.577
News flash:
Everybody is cursed.

15:22.578 --> 15:24.713
You lost your money
last year.

15:24.714 --> 15:28.047
Literally nothing good
has ever happened to me.

15:28.484 --> 15:30.852
Han hasn't grown
since the fourth grade.

15:32.103 --> 15:34.686
Oleg's toenails
look like Fritos.

15:35.892 --> 15:39.225
And Earl was born black at
the eighth-or ninth-worst time

15:39.595 --> 15:42.364
to be a black man
in America.

15:42.365 --> 15:45.698
Look around,
it's the valley of the damned.

15:45.935 --> 15:48.470
Name one person
who isn't cursed.

15:48.471 --> 15:49.771
Hey, guys!

15:49.772 --> 15:52.841
I just found a $100 bill
on the sidewalk!

15:53.342 --> 15:55.177
Drinks for everyone!

15:55.178 --> 15:57.813
Max,
pop open the fancy brandy.

15:57.814 --> 16:00.148
"Fancy Brandy"
is gonna be my stripper name

16:00.149 --> 16:02.784
if you ever let me
put in that pole.

16:02.785 --> 16:03.919
Sophie, guess what?

16:03.920 --> 16:05.720
We went back to that psychic
to complain,

16:05.721 --> 16:07.489
and she put a curse on us.

16:07.990 --> 16:10.823
Oh.
You're cursed?

16:13.462 --> 16:16.295
Uh...

16:17.400 --> 16:20.733
[Groaning]

16:21.871 --> 16:24.906
But it's stupid,
like you said, right?

16:24.907 --> 16:28.240
Yeah, yeah.
That's stupid.

16:28.544 --> 16:30.245
Yeah.

16:30.246 --> 16:33.579
Did she mention me?

16:34.350 --> 16:35.617
No.

16:36.118 --> 16:37.686
She just cursed us
and said

16:37.687 --> 16:40.722
our whole lives would
come crashing down around us.

16:40.723 --> 16:42.624
[Shelf crashes]

16:42.625 --> 16:45.958
[Screaming]

16:49.598 --> 16:52.031
And 30, 40, 50.

16:54.002 --> 16:56.335
[Hisses]
The curse is lifted.

16:56.906 --> 16:59.341
Oh, I don't think you got me.
What about my curse?

16:59.342 --> 17:01.309
[Hisses]

17:01.310 --> 17:03.411
Talk about phoning it in.

17:03.412 --> 17:05.547
Couldn't you wave a feather
or spin your head

17:05.548 --> 17:07.348
or throw up
or something?

17:07.349 --> 17:09.551
That's extra.

17:10.553 --> 17:12.587
You know what?
I'm in a good mood tonight.

17:12.588 --> 17:15.223
I got through the whole day
on 15 cigarettes

17:15.223 --> 17:16.491
and one sheet cake.

17:16.492 --> 17:19.825
I'm gonna give tough guy
a free reading here.

17:20.128 --> 17:23.462
Oh, free, as in the $50
you just shook us down for?

17:23.566 --> 17:26.898
[Laughs, coughs]

17:27.970 --> 17:30.803
Should never have quit.
Okay.

17:31.540 --> 17:33.174
Future coming right at you.

17:33.175 --> 17:35.844
I see that you will
have a happy life.

17:35.845 --> 17:37.712
[Scoffs]
Me, happy?

17:37.713 --> 17:39.714
All right, get your hat,
mother. We're leaving.

17:39.715 --> 17:43.048
And I see a large sum of money
coming your way.

17:43.819 --> 17:45.253
Over $10,000.

17:45.254 --> 17:47.222
Max, it's the grant.

17:47.223 --> 17:49.391
We applied for $12,000.
Is that it?

17:49.392 --> 17:52.193
- Sure.
- [Gasps]

17:52.194 --> 17:55.030
And in spite
of your bad childhood...

17:55.031 --> 17:56.665
[Gasps] She knew
you had a bad childhood.

17:56.666 --> 17:58.833
Come on,
every childhood is bad.

17:58.834 --> 18:00.402
You're stupid.
You can't reach stuff.

18:00.403 --> 18:02.737
It's rough.

18:02.738 --> 18:04.105
In spite of it,

18:04.106 --> 18:07.439
I see great love and children
in your future.

18:08.311 --> 18:09.778
Max.

18:09.779 --> 18:11.680
Me? [Laughs]
No, wait.

18:11.681 --> 18:13.014
You must be picking up
on her vibes.

18:13.015 --> 18:14.115
Check again.

18:14.816 --> 18:17.749
No, great love
and children

18:17.787 --> 18:20.120
will be part of your future.

18:22.024 --> 18:24.826
She will die alone.

18:24.827 --> 18:26.661
Okay, well,
that's all I can take.

18:26.662 --> 18:28.797
I'm not gonna sit here and wait
for the other Paul to fall.

18:28.798 --> 18:30.298
- Let's go, Max.
- No, no, no, no.

18:30.299 --> 18:31.499
No, no. Wait.

18:31.500 --> 18:34.833
She obviously got it wrong.
Didn't you?

18:36.072 --> 18:39.107
Nope.
Still dying alone...

18:39.108 --> 18:41.810
With nothing
but her great success.

18:41.811 --> 18:43.645
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
What?

18:43.646 --> 18:46.314
I see great success
in your future.

18:46.315 --> 18:48.817
You do?
Oh, thank God.

18:48.818 --> 18:51.653
I'm gonna have success?
How big a success?

18:51.654 --> 18:52.821
Oh, honey, it's so big,

18:52.822 --> 18:56.057
you won't even know
you're alone.

18:59.929 --> 19:01.062
All right, go.

19:01.063 --> 19:04.299
May you live
a long and healthy life.

19:04.300 --> 19:06.067
And put on your hat
and gloves.

19:06.068 --> 19:09.401
I'm predicting snow.
[Coughs]

19:13.309 --> 19:15.176
It's not going to snow.

19:15.177 --> 19:18.013
At most, it's gonna rain
30-year-old dudes.

19:18.014 --> 19:20.048
Maybe she isn't so psychic.

19:20.049 --> 19:21.683
Stop fighting it, Max.

19:21.684 --> 19:23.084
You're gonna find love
and be happy,

19:23.085 --> 19:25.120
and I'm gonna be successful.

19:25.121 --> 19:26.221
You hear that, New York?

19:26.222 --> 19:29.555
I'm gonna be
successful and alone!

19:30.626 --> 19:33.561
And robbed and raped
if you keep calling that out.

19:33.562 --> 19:35.163
And it all started
when I dropped

19:35.164 --> 19:37.265
that grant application
into that mailbox

19:37.266 --> 19:39.501
that those guys are unbolting
and taking away.

19:39.502 --> 19:40.969
What's going on?

19:40.970 --> 19:43.004
It's called emails.

19:43.005 --> 19:45.507
We're getting rid of this.
No one mails anything anymore.

19:45.508 --> 19:47.675
Yes, they do.
I did yesterday.

19:47.676 --> 19:50.045
And our $12,000 depends on it.

19:50.046 --> 19:51.312
Sorry, doll.

19:51.313 --> 19:53.081
This box has been
out of commission for a week.

19:53.082 --> 19:55.183
According to a psychic,
her box is gonna be

19:55.184 --> 19:57.118
out of commission forever.

19:57.119 --> 19:58.286
We had to tell him.

19:58.287 --> 20:01.322
You expect me to lie
to a city employee?

20:01.323 --> 20:04.359
So I guess
we're not getting that grant.

20:04.360 --> 20:06.461
The psychic was wrong.

20:06.462 --> 20:08.730
Maybe nothing she said
is gonna come true.

20:08.731 --> 20:12.000
I told you,
it's a scam.

20:12.501 --> 20:14.269
Max, look.

20:14.270 --> 20:17.505
It's snowing.
And she predicted snow.

20:17.506 --> 20:20.839
Oh, crap!
Am I gonna have kids?

20:21.077 --> 20:24.012
So she was right on snow,
but not on the money.

20:24.013 --> 20:26.014
So what is it?

20:26.015 --> 20:28.917
Am I or am I not gonna die
old and alone?

20:28.918 --> 20:30.885
Why are we even
talking about this?

20:30.886 --> 20:33.488
We're probably not gonna
make it through the winter.

20:34.489 --> 20:36.791
And by the way,
if you die first,

20:36.792 --> 20:38.726
I am totally eating you.

20:38.727 --> 20:40.695
Oh. I know.

20:40.696 --> 20:42.263
And besides,

20:42.264 --> 20:44.332
no one person
can get it all.

20:44.833 --> 20:45.700
You're right.

20:45.701 --> 20:48.703
No one person can,
but what about two?

20:48.704 --> 20:50.371
You'll have
the love and the kids

20:50.372 --> 20:51.539
and I'll have success.

20:51.540 --> 20:53.741
Maybe we can share,
like we share our tips

20:53.742 --> 20:56.377
or that wheat thin we found
in your pillowcase.

20:56.378 --> 20:58.746
Are you asking to bang
my great love?

20:58.747 --> 21:01.082
Which is fine with me,
because I'm already bored

21:01.083 --> 21:03.485
and sleeping with
his poker buddy.

21:03.486 --> 21:04.886
In fact, let's switch.

21:04.887 --> 21:07.455
You can have my great love,
and I'll die alone.

21:07.456 --> 21:10.125
Max, you don't want
to die alone.

21:10.126 --> 21:13.459
I am dying to die alone.

21:14.460 --> 21:18.459
