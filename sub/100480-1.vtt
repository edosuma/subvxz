WEBVTT

00:18.750 --> 00:22.708
This is Heidelberg,
the Heidelberg Castle, the Neckar,

00:24.500 --> 00:26.541
a fraternity student
who has lost his group.

00:30.541 --> 00:34.166
And this is a small celebration
of the Voigt family in 2004.

00:34.666 --> 00:37.791
"...expression in the empty tree."

00:38.500 --> 00:40.958
And this is Isabelle, nickname Isi.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.000
Isi.

00:42.791 --> 00:44.500
Isi has prepared one as well.

00:44.583 --> 00:47.041
And her mother, Claudia, who has rehearsed

00:47.125 --> 00:49.916
a deliberately chosen poem
with Isi for days.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.458
Come on. Come forward.

00:59.458 --> 01:02.291
While Isi learned about the word
"grounded" for the first time,

01:02.375 --> 01:05.583
a completely different family moved
to the neighboring city, Mannheim.

01:06.166 --> 01:09.666
This is also the Neckar,
Germany's best kebab,

01:11.375 --> 01:13.666
and this is the Markowski family
from Brandenburg.

01:14.500 --> 01:17.750
Tell me, which has more letters,
"pepper" or "orange"?

01:17.833 --> 01:18.916
This is Oscar.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.083
I don't give a shit.

01:20.166 --> 01:21.208
And his mother, Betty.

01:21.291 --> 01:22.958
It's the same. Weird, right?

01:23.041 --> 01:26.416
Oscar, nobody likes smartasses.
Now get me the fries.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.416
Who invented French fries?

01:28.500 --> 01:31.041
-Mr. French.
-And where do they come from?

01:31.125 --> 01:33.500
-From the fries animal.
-Who invented the PlayStation?

01:33.583 --> 01:34.708
Your granny.

01:34.791 --> 01:37.083
-Really?
-Sure. That's why she took off.

01:37.166 --> 01:39.958
Because she got rich with the PlayStation,
the stupid cunt.

01:40.041 --> 01:43.291
And Oscar's grandpa,
with whom Oscar wouldn't spend much time,

01:43.375 --> 01:46.125
as Grandpa chose
a sure-fire business opportunity that day.

01:46.208 --> 01:48.583
Come on, hand over the money!
Put it in a bag.

01:48.666 --> 01:50.708
-I don't have--
-Fuck! Do you have a bag?

01:55.208 --> 01:57.666
Hey! Shut up!
Speak English for crying out loud!

01:57.750 --> 01:59.083
How are you?

01:59.166 --> 02:00.500
"How are you?"

02:01.083 --> 02:04.541
Hey! Now give me the money
or I'll shoot you in the foot!

02:04.625 --> 02:07.166
Stand still.

02:09.291 --> 02:11.791
Damn camel jockeys. Fuck.

02:11.875 --> 02:14.458
At the same time
Oscar's grandpa bent over for his soap,

02:14.541 --> 02:18.458
Isi decided to get to the bottom
of a big secret in her home.

02:18.541 --> 02:20.458
Mom, I need to go to the toilet.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.750
Yeah, okay. But hurry,
we haven't even done half yet.

02:23.833 --> 02:26.583
There's a big party tomorrow.
You'll have to be faster then.

02:26.666 --> 02:29.708
Double that speed at least,
I'm telling you.

02:30.791 --> 02:33.458
Get cutting properly, boy.
Are you in love with the tomato?

02:33.541 --> 02:36.416
Those are not the boobs of a 16-year-old.
It's food!

02:36.500 --> 02:37.458
Yes, I'm doing it.

02:37.541 --> 02:39.916
Isi, come on.
You can't disturb them at work.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.125
I said downstairs is off-limits.

02:42.208 --> 02:45.416
Although Isi and Oscar were practically
neighbors in Heidelberg and Mannheim,

02:45.500 --> 02:47.625
there was one main difference
between them.

02:48.250 --> 02:51.916
When Isi was ten years old,
the wealth of her family was exactly

02:52.000 --> 02:57.958
€2,347,867,513.27.

02:58.041 --> 03:00.041
That's why her classes looked like this.

03:05.208 --> 03:08.958
At the same time, the wealth
of Oscar's single mom was exactly

03:09.041 --> 03:11.458
€27.63.

03:11.541 --> 03:13.541
That's why Oscar's classes
looked like this.

03:13.625 --> 03:14.750
Just keep quiet!

03:18.083 --> 03:22.000
This is Tschünni, by the way. He just
decided to become Oscar's best friend.

03:22.083 --> 03:25.958
As his aggression grew worse,
his mother Betty brought him to boxing.

03:26.041 --> 03:28.166
The boy is good. I like him.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.500
-Lanky.
-We'll take him.

03:29.583 --> 03:32.750
What kind of a name is Oscar?
I'll call you Ossi. That's better.

03:32.833 --> 03:35.125
-Fine. We, Easterners, are called Ossi.
-Cool.

03:35.208 --> 03:38.458
Over the years, the kitchen
became Isi's absolute favorite place.

03:38.541 --> 03:40.500
"Did they put your brain backwards?"

03:40.583 --> 03:41.458
You never said that.

03:41.541 --> 03:44.416
Don't talk back to your boss
when she's trying to be cool, asshole.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.833
And you, rat, are you laughing at me?

03:46.916 --> 03:49.625
While her school career
had developed into a disaster.

03:49.708 --> 03:50.791
"Recommendation for...

03:51.875 --> 03:53.166
Realschule"?

03:55.125 --> 03:55.958
Manfred.

03:56.041 --> 03:59.833
Therefore, Claudia dismissed
all kitchen personnel in 2012.

04:00.458 --> 04:02.500
It's in your best interest.

04:03.083 --> 04:05.416
You need to concentrate
on your schoolwork, honey.

04:08.791 --> 04:10.791
Ossi had had no interest in school
for a long time.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.125
He's now in his early 20s

04:12.208 --> 04:14.250
and the breakthrough
in his boxing career is pending.

04:14.333 --> 04:16.875
Belt, belt! Hit his trap!

04:16.958 --> 04:18.833
-What?
-Punch his mug!

04:18.916 --> 04:20.916
-What?
-You're supposed to deck me.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.458
Like carrying water to the Rhine.

04:24.541 --> 04:27.708
Now, Ossi is facing his most
important fight against Yannis Vukovic.

04:27.791 --> 04:30.541
If he does well,
he can make the professional league.

04:30.625 --> 04:32.166
-Just arrived.
-Thank you.

04:33.250 --> 04:35.833
-Isi, where are you?
-Kitchen.

04:35.916 --> 04:38.375
Isi has just passed her Abitur
after a long school career

04:38.458 --> 04:40.666
which included repeating two classes.

04:40.750 --> 04:42.583
According to the principal,
the worst Abitur result

04:42.666 --> 04:44.500
in the 400-year-old school history.

05:00.375 --> 05:04.833
And in just a few weeks, Isi is supposed
to attend a prestigious business school.

05:04.916 --> 05:07.375
Isi, I know you're not keen
on attending the prom,

05:07.458 --> 05:09.416
but maybe this will change your mind.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.666
That's about it.
This is where our story begins...

05:30.125 --> 05:31.375
017 POSITION 03

05:53.125 --> 05:55.375
And coincidentally,

05:55.458 --> 05:59.208
I even know your aunt's husband!

06:17.125 --> 06:19.458
Isabelle! Roll up! Come on!

06:20.333 --> 06:21.750
I have an appointment, but--

06:21.833 --> 06:24.041
I know you're supposed
to pick up your brain...

06:24.791 --> 06:25.791
Your Abitur results.

06:27.958 --> 06:30.166
Your brain? What nonsense.
You never had it.

06:31.250 --> 06:32.375
Are you drunk?

06:32.458 --> 06:35.708
I have just quit and I noticed your...

06:36.000 --> 06:39.208
Abitur lying around and thought
I'd give it to you and congratulate you.

06:41.083 --> 06:43.125
-You quit.
-Congratulations.

06:43.833 --> 06:47.125
Please give Mr. Büttner
my congratulations on your graduation.

06:52.041 --> 06:54.375
GENERAL QUALIFICATION
FOR UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE

06:57.666 --> 06:58.791
Oh, no!

06:59.333 --> 07:02.583
You missed out on that even though
your lawyer was here so often.

07:04.833 --> 07:06.875
Your parents did this behind your back.

07:07.875 --> 07:10.000
But you must have been wondering yourself

07:10.083 --> 07:14.041
how you could pass the Abitur with the IQ
of a gummy bear. Quite an achievement.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.416
What?

07:17.250 --> 07:19.916
-Lawyer?
-You know, for someone who worked hard,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.875
it's really great to see
that there is an easier way.

07:22.958 --> 07:26.458
You just need rich parents, good lawyers,

07:26.541 --> 07:28.375
making teachers' lives hell

07:28.458 --> 07:31.833
till they turn into alcoholics
and they blow the Abitur up the ass

07:31.916 --> 07:33.958
of every borderline moronic
rich kid. Great!

07:35.833 --> 07:37.708
Shit got more expensive again.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.791
-Not your fault.
-No, it got less expensive.

07:41.291 --> 07:43.166
Make it 46, boss.

07:45.250 --> 07:46.666
Time to talk about Grandpa.

07:46.750 --> 07:50.416
The shit is getting more expensive
every week. I say democracy is crap.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.125
I experienced Hitler.

07:52.208 --> 07:55.208
Man, you haven't. How old are you, 70?
Retard.

07:55.291 --> 08:00.250
This time he stays out of jail, Ossi,
you hear? And you make sure he behaves.

08:00.333 --> 08:02.375
-When is he coming out?
-Monday, probably.

08:02.458 --> 08:05.916
You know what Grandpa is like.
He always needs some support.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.666
I don't care about the asshole.
I need to prepare for the fight.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.916
Don't talk about your Grandpa like that.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.625
-Mrs. Markowski?
-That's correct.

08:12.708 --> 08:16.416
My boss asked me to give you this

08:16.500 --> 08:18.041
-in person.
-How nice.

08:18.125 --> 08:21.333
A bit of goodwill.
I don't think you got the others.

08:21.416 --> 08:23.541
-Next time, it will be the marshal.
-Right.

08:23.625 --> 08:27.041
Or the police. Actually, I don't know
who will show up, but it won't be us.

08:27.125 --> 08:28.125
Tax office?

08:28.208 --> 08:30.125
-Do you not want to look inside?
-No.

08:30.208 --> 08:33.250
Okay, we're just investing
into an electronic pump,

08:33.333 --> 08:34.875
so we won't need your help anymore.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.916
-The missing €14,000...
-Yeah.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
...and I would like to stress
the "missing" part...

08:41.083 --> 08:42.291
Calm down now.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.791
-Who's that idiot?
-Tschünni, don't, man.

08:46.875 --> 08:49.000
-Betty, honey, how are you?
-Everything's fine.

08:49.083 --> 08:50.250
Just ignore him, okay?

08:50.333 --> 08:52.083
Thanks for coming.
It's under control.

08:52.166 --> 08:54.083
The €14,000 is not an investment.

08:54.166 --> 08:58.250
It's a debt you owe to the tax office
and you need to pay immediately,

08:58.333 --> 09:00.125
-before you invest in anything else.
-Thanks. Bye.

09:00.208 --> 09:02.958
-We owe €14,000?
-It's really not a big deal.

09:03.041 --> 09:05.791
How is this not a big deal?
When were you going to tell me?

09:05.875 --> 09:07.041
-I have another job.
-Yes?

09:07.125 --> 09:08.833
-Mom? Hey!
-I might become manager.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.083
I got the car from my dad for my Abitur.

09:11.166 --> 09:13.583
Could you park it somewhere else
while our parents are here?

09:13.666 --> 09:17.250
Excuse me, he just got it. Of course
he wants to show it off today.

09:17.333 --> 09:19.791
If my dad sees you have a Tesla,
he'll get me one, too.

09:19.875 --> 09:21.208
Tell him you don't want one.

09:21.291 --> 09:24.333
Will that help his self-esteem
or enlarge his weenie?

09:24.416 --> 09:27.250
So I'll get a Tesla.
I survived bigger things.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.000
Poor you, you got problems.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.708
Isi?

09:31.791 --> 09:33.750
GALLERY

09:33.833 --> 09:34.958
Why are we running?

09:38.208 --> 09:39.291
Isi!

09:40.833 --> 09:42.333
-Nice.
-Have you seen my parents?

09:42.416 --> 09:44.541
I'll help you find them
if you go on another date with me.

09:45.708 --> 09:46.625
What?

09:46.708 --> 09:48.333
You had two dates. She's not interested.

09:48.416 --> 09:50.375
-How sad are you?
-Okay, in that case,

09:50.458 --> 09:53.333
I suggest we say I was here,
tried everything,

09:53.416 --> 09:55.416
in case anybody's asking,
like your father...

09:55.500 --> 09:57.291
Camilla, are you my witness?

09:57.375 --> 09:58.500
What did he give you?

09:59.500 --> 10:03.250
He's just worried about you,
you know that, and he likes me a lot,

10:03.625 --> 10:05.666
and the internship
in Shanghai isn't happening,

10:05.750 --> 10:07.375
and now your father is checking if--

10:07.458 --> 10:11.083
My father promised you an internship
if you try again?

10:11.166 --> 10:12.000
Yeah.

10:12.083 --> 10:14.500
Which I have done here
in front of witnesses.

10:14.583 --> 10:16.541
Could you send me the video? Thank you.

10:17.375 --> 10:21.416
Enjoy the exhibition.
I find it a bit... loud.

10:24.375 --> 10:25.416
Lanky, listen.

10:26.750 --> 10:29.625
That Vuku... Ludu...

10:29.708 --> 10:31.833
-Sudoku, Sonduko...
-Vukovic, man.

10:31.916 --> 10:34.750
Yeah, just knock him out,
you know what I mean?

10:34.833 --> 10:37.583
But I still won't have
the damn €14,000, man.

10:37.666 --> 10:40.416
Fuck that.
But deck that lame duck, you hear?

10:40.500 --> 10:41.458
Ossi!

10:41.541 --> 10:42.708
Hey, dumbass.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.500
Listen, I'm having a bit of trouble
with your sponsor.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.666
The silly clot is peeved about something.

10:53.166 --> 10:54.375
-What?
-Clot.

10:54.458 --> 10:57.125
We have a problem. A disaster.

10:58.208 --> 11:00.208
The end of the world. Armageddon.

11:00.875 --> 11:03.125
-What?
-Your sponsor has jumped ship.

11:03.791 --> 11:05.541
-He jumped on?
-Jumped off!

11:05.625 --> 11:08.916
-He jumped off. Talk clearly.
-We don't have enough money for the fight.

11:09.958 --> 11:13.500
Your sponsor doesn't believe
in you anymore. You're here part-time,

11:13.583 --> 11:15.416
and the rest of the day,
at the gas station.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.041
-Don't talk shit, dumbass.
-He's out.

11:18.125 --> 11:18.958
That asshole.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.583
We need €8,000.

11:25.166 --> 11:26.000
Ossi!

11:27.458 --> 11:29.750
-How long have you been fixing my grades?
-Isi.

11:30.541 --> 11:32.958
How nice of you to come
to the opening of our exhibition

11:33.041 --> 11:36.250
that is so important to us.
Mr. Erduan, I'll be right back.

11:38.083 --> 11:40.916
How long has your fucking lawyer
been fixing my grades?

11:41.000 --> 11:44.541
He didn't fix them.
He was just helping them a bit.

11:44.625 --> 11:47.625
There's no shame in that.
Everybody gets tutoring.

11:47.708 --> 11:50.041
-Because I didn't pass the Abitur?
-You have your Abitur.

11:50.125 --> 11:52.708
I don't have my Abitur
and I won't go to college.

11:53.208 --> 11:54.125
Isi.

11:54.791 --> 11:56.208
Of course you'll go to college.

11:56.833 --> 12:00.208
I'll train to be a chef
with Santino Borges in New York.

12:00.291 --> 12:02.625
-What?
-It will be quite expensive.

12:03.833 --> 12:06.291
How much is in the deposit account
you set up for me?

12:06.375 --> 12:10.500
You will get the money when you turn 25
and have graduated from college.

12:11.333 --> 12:15.291
-Could you stop that stupid grin?
-Could you stop making such a scene?

12:15.375 --> 12:17.666
-Isi.
-I get my money now.

12:17.750 --> 12:20.791
It's normal that you're angry right now,

12:20.875 --> 12:22.833
but you don't seriously
want to become a chef.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.875
Santino Borges
is an Argentinian celebrity chef.

12:24.958 --> 12:27.625
And he teaches in his
New York School of Culinary Arts.

12:27.708 --> 12:29.958
-Sounds like a satire.
-Do you know what satire is?

12:30.041 --> 12:33.500
You promising someone an internship
so he would date me.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.333
-I want my money now.
-Isi!

12:40.541 --> 12:43.125
You're not getting
a cent for such bullshit!

12:43.875 --> 12:46.958
I want my money. From now on,
I'll make my own decisions.

12:47.541 --> 12:49.166
Over my dead body.

12:53.583 --> 12:54.833
Isi!

12:56.083 --> 12:58.583
-A really nice show.
-Thanks, Camilla.

13:00.458 --> 13:01.291
Klaus!

13:01.791 --> 13:02.791
Leave it.

13:03.916 --> 13:06.583
She'll come round.
Training to be a chef, she's lost it.

13:06.666 --> 13:09.958
Follow her and watch her. And, Klaus!

13:11.125 --> 13:13.250
-Don't let her see you, okay?
-Sure.

13:33.750 --> 13:36.875
"Champagne-cornflakes breakfast.
Hashtag, fuck the world."

13:36.958 --> 13:37.958
41,000 likes.

13:38.041 --> 13:40.875
-What's that supposed to tell me, Camilla?
-The world is not fair.

13:41.625 --> 13:45.500
My 433,712 followers have accepted it
and you should, too.

13:45.583 --> 13:48.125
Fact is, you have your Abi,
you can go to college.

13:48.208 --> 13:51.958
Why should I? Why is it that
everybody thinks I should go to college?

13:52.041 --> 13:53.166
College is easy.

13:53.250 --> 13:56.250
-I'm enjoying it.
-But you have a 1.1 Abitur. I don't.

13:56.333 --> 13:58.541
I can't do that. I don't even know how--

13:58.666 --> 14:01.458
In case you're committing suicide,
I would like to get out. Okay?

14:04.500 --> 14:05.666
We're driving to Mannheim.

14:08.333 --> 14:12.750
Are you serious? I can't go to Mannheim.
I didn't bring my pepper spray. Wait...

14:17.416 --> 14:18.750
What are we doing in Mannheim?

14:28.625 --> 14:30.791
I just need this fucking fight, man.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.708
Or it won't work out
with the professional league.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.666
-Enjoy.
-How do you do it? You just don't care.

14:38.750 --> 14:40.958
You don't care,
you have to do construction work.

14:41.041 --> 14:43.583
-It's honest work.
-Yeah, but you don't even try.

14:43.666 --> 14:46.000
-I mean, don't you want--
-Ossi, you're so German.

14:46.083 --> 14:47.250
I'm what?

14:47.333 --> 14:49.708
"Hey, foreman, you need to do something
with your life!

14:49.791 --> 14:52.916
No pain, no gain. You stole the goose."
Fuck that.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
I'm not that German.

14:55.916 --> 14:57.500
HELP WANTED!

14:59.250 --> 15:00.416
I'm just a normal German.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.000
If a potato fucks leeks,
you're the result.

15:03.083 --> 15:04.791
That's how German you are.

15:04.875 --> 15:07.916
You keep doing construction.
Drain yourself. Not me.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.833
Construction is shit, but someone has
to do it. I can't do anything else.

15:10.916 --> 15:13.791
Hey, you're Ossi, right? The boxer?

15:14.666 --> 15:15.916
Oscar to you, brother.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.750
I'm not your brother.
You're a camel jockey.

15:17.833 --> 15:20.500
I'm a boxer, too. Your technique sucks.

15:22.333 --> 15:24.916
-Okay.
-Technique? Seriously?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.041
Baloo, you're cross-eyed. You can't box.

15:27.125 --> 15:28.916
-Shut your trap!
-Shut up!

15:29.000 --> 15:31.291
Hey, man. Let us eat, okay?

15:31.375 --> 15:33.916
Yeah, let us eat.
You eat the burger, if you can.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.791
It's difficult in 2-D. Would you like me
to get you 3-D glasses?

15:36.875 --> 15:38.625
-Just you wait--
-Come on, then!

15:38.708 --> 15:40.958
Hey! Calm down, both of you!
Sit down!

15:41.041 --> 15:43.083
Hello. What would you like?

15:43.875 --> 15:46.333
Hello. I saw that you're hiring.

15:47.416 --> 15:49.666
Hello, what would you hire?

15:54.750 --> 15:57.375
-Boss!
-I mean...

15:58.958 --> 16:01.750
-Gabriella.
-The register opened.

16:01.833 --> 16:02.833
Then close it.

16:08.125 --> 16:11.166
Excuse me. I saw that you're hiring.

16:12.208 --> 16:14.041
I want the job.

16:15.083 --> 16:16.041
You don't fit in here.

16:17.083 --> 16:19.375
-Why not?
-You have more than three brain cells.

16:20.916 --> 16:22.041
I still want to try.

16:23.791 --> 16:26.375
I pay peanuts, all my staff are impaired,

16:26.458 --> 16:30.500
and the food we serve has been proven
to make you blind and impotent.

16:31.083 --> 16:33.375
Perfect. I'm just the girl.

16:33.458 --> 16:36.291
Okay, then. Trial day tomorrow?

16:36.541 --> 16:38.041
Your grandpa is getting out of jail.

16:38.125 --> 16:40.125
You need cash, you need to risk something.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.291
Am I supposed to rob a bank with him?

16:42.375 --> 16:44.958
Grandpa is
the most untalented gangster ever!

16:45.041 --> 16:47.375
-He's a playboy.
-Right. Finished.

16:48.375 --> 16:52.291
-Come on, let's get started.
-Very well.

16:53.833 --> 16:55.875
Hey, man.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.666
You can only blame yourself, dumbass.

17:05.000 --> 17:05.958
Come on, mongo.

17:07.458 --> 17:10.000
Get up. Yes, there.

17:10.875 --> 17:12.125
Dumbass.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.250
-Did I win?
-Hey!

17:18.958 --> 17:21.750
Quite the show just now.

17:24.083 --> 17:26.166
It was his fault.
You just wanted to settle it.

17:26.458 --> 17:27.833
Would you like to go out sometime?

17:31.166 --> 17:33.708
Doesn't have to be the guy
making the first move, right?

17:46.708 --> 17:48.166
-Text me.
-What's your name?

17:48.833 --> 17:50.083
-Isabelle.
-And?

17:50.166 --> 17:51.833
Voigt... Müller.

17:53.416 --> 17:55.708
My name is Müller. What about yours?

17:56.083 --> 17:57.750
I won't tell. I don't even know you.

17:57.833 --> 18:00.583
IS THIS ART OF RUBBISH?
ART - RUBBISH

18:00.666 --> 18:04.208
Sorry. Do you really think
you can blackmail your parents like this?

18:12.083 --> 18:14.125
-I can't find "Isabelle Vogt."
-Try "oi."

18:15.208 --> 18:16.333
Voigt, as in "Froid."

18:20.750 --> 18:21.583
What's that?

18:23.916 --> 18:25.958
-Yeah.
-Gross, those people.

18:26.041 --> 18:26.916
Dude.

18:28.250 --> 18:30.833
-Fierce.
-Filthy rich.

18:31.833 --> 18:34.583
I have an idea. You're thinking
what I'm thinking, right?

18:35.000 --> 18:36.750
Nice, Betty, we always think the same.

18:36.833 --> 18:39.125
-You can win her over, Ossi.
-What?

18:39.208 --> 18:41.125
You don't even have to feel bad about it.

18:41.708 --> 18:43.666
As if a rich bitch like that
would want me.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.458
-What?
-What are you talking about?

18:45.541 --> 18:47.208
You're the most handsome guy I know.

18:47.291 --> 18:48.166
Ossi, listen.

18:49.041 --> 18:52.416
We need money
and you can easily win her over.

18:53.625 --> 18:55.541
Yeah, you win her over
and she'll help you.

18:56.041 --> 18:57.500
You don't have to marry her.

18:58.250 --> 19:01.500
Just take a little bit of money.

19:02.958 --> 19:05.583
Hello? I'm serious.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.541
I've rarely felt as embarrassed
as I did today.

19:31.125 --> 19:34.666
That someone so privileged,
with such a good education,

19:34.750 --> 19:38.083
whose parents always had her back,
that someone like that tramples her future

19:38.166 --> 19:39.500
and her Abitur...

19:40.125 --> 19:41.375
It makes me angry.

19:41.458 --> 19:44.250
Excuse me, Claudia.
That's not how we wanted to word it.

19:44.333 --> 19:47.083
You will not become a chef. It's absurd.

19:47.166 --> 19:50.458
And that embarrassing number in Mannheim

19:50.541 --> 19:53.000
in that... chips joint...

19:53.541 --> 19:55.583
Isi, grow up.

19:56.833 --> 19:59.166
YO, HI SWEET PRINCESS.
DINNER TOMORROW?

19:59.250 --> 20:00.083
FAN BELT

20:00.166 --> 20:01.666
Ossi, you need to send a picture!

20:01.750 --> 20:03.541
-Leave it!
-Dammit, man!

20:03.625 --> 20:04.750
-New deodorant?
-Fuck.

20:05.166 --> 20:06.791
THANKS FOR THE BUMMER
NUMBER

20:06.875 --> 20:08.375
DO SOMETHING TOMORROW?
XOXO, OSSI

20:08.458 --> 20:10.041
THAT'S MY NAME
NICKNAME. REAL NAME IS OSCAR

20:10.125 --> 20:11.000
Isi.

20:15.666 --> 20:16.875
Yeah, you're right, Mom.

20:18.208 --> 20:19.041
Good night.

20:22.041 --> 20:28.666
TOMORROW 2 P.M. AT THE BURGER JOINT?

20:32.666 --> 20:34.166
So that's for the chips.

20:34.250 --> 20:37.833
If you use your brain for thinking,
not as a paperweight, it's quite simple.

20:37.916 --> 20:39.625
Once it beeps, you take it out,

20:40.416 --> 20:42.875
hang it up and let it drip.

20:43.458 --> 20:45.666
You've met Gabriella. Keep an eye on her.

20:46.291 --> 20:48.666
She messes up anything
that can possibly be messed up.

20:48.750 --> 20:51.458
-Boss, please and thank you.
-Yeah, please and thank you.

20:51.541 --> 20:55.291
Then some salt, three times,

20:56.666 --> 20:57.625
mix it...

21:01.791 --> 21:03.041
and the doctorate is done.

21:04.583 --> 21:05.833
There's still time to leave.

21:06.416 --> 21:08.500
No, I think it's great.

21:10.083 --> 21:11.000
It's real here.

21:12.250 --> 21:15.125
Not much in our food is real. But...

21:17.166 --> 21:18.958
-Is this the burger you made?
-Yeah.

21:19.500 --> 21:20.916
I tried something.

21:25.291 --> 21:28.250
Far too thick. Again.

21:28.833 --> 21:32.666
Boss. They're defrosted
and smell of shit somehow.

21:34.916 --> 21:37.458
-They're absolutely fine. Come on.
-Yeah.

21:37.541 --> 21:39.583
Don't look that closely
all the time. Idiot.

21:47.333 --> 21:49.041
Hello. What can I get you?

21:50.458 --> 21:53.500
K14. 85,000... Wait a second.

21:54.875 --> 21:56.500
-Yes?
-Hello, Manfred. It's Klaus.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.291
What is it?
I'm in the middle of stocktaking.

21:58.375 --> 22:01.000
Isi is really working here.

22:01.666 --> 22:03.333
-Seriously?
-One hundred percent.

22:03.416 --> 22:06.750
-I'm on it. Manfred, you--
-I got you, yeah.

22:08.541 --> 22:11.458
-Here?
-No clue. She suggested it.

22:11.541 --> 22:15.916
-Whatever. Lanky, go get her.
-No clue how. How do you get a girl?

22:18.208 --> 22:20.291
The secret is compliments.
Compliment her, it's simple.

22:20.375 --> 22:24.208
Women like that. They're like junkies,
their brain cuts out.

22:24.291 --> 22:25.875
You're the expert now, huh?

22:25.958 --> 22:28.083
One question, how did Rocky get Adrian?

22:28.166 --> 22:32.041
He went to the fucking pet shop
every single night, complimented her,

22:32.125 --> 22:34.833
invited her for Thanksgiving.
She didn't say thanks once,

22:34.916 --> 22:37.750
not even once. In the end, he married her.

22:37.833 --> 22:40.250
And the pimps from the 19th
do exactly the same.

22:40.333 --> 22:42.458
They bombard women with compliments.

22:42.541 --> 22:45.958
Then they fall in love. "I think you're
the one for me. You're so pretty!"

22:46.041 --> 22:48.583
Then they rape them
and pump them full of heroin.

22:50.541 --> 22:52.916
-You forget about the last part.
-Not cool, man.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.416
-Can you make compliments?
-Yes.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.583
-Can you make compliments?
-Normally, I can!

22:56.666 --> 22:57.541
Let's go!

23:00.458 --> 23:01.791
Adrian!

23:01.875 --> 23:03.541
See you at the workout.

23:12.041 --> 23:12.958
Hey.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.833
Well? Hey.

23:24.416 --> 23:26.625
-Have you been waiting for long?
-No.

23:27.166 --> 23:29.875
Good, 'cause you're not supposed
to make a princess wait.

23:31.416 --> 23:34.208
Because you're so pretty.
I mean, I come in,

23:34.291 --> 23:37.041
see you sitting there and think,
"Who's that model?"

23:37.750 --> 23:40.875
-Thanks.
-And yesterday when you approached me,

23:40.958 --> 23:44.541
my eyes nearly popped out of my head,
you're so pretty and... well...

23:45.875 --> 23:48.541
-Your outfit, no clue...
-Well...

23:48.625 --> 23:51.125
-You know more about that than me.
-I work here.

23:52.583 --> 23:53.416
What...

23:54.375 --> 23:57.125
-You work here?
-Yes. I'm on my lunch break.

24:00.250 --> 24:01.416
You want to eat something?

24:02.375 --> 24:04.958
-You?
-Yes.

24:05.041 --> 24:06.458
Maybe I do.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.333
Well, okay...

24:08.416 --> 24:09.916
MOM - HURRY UP!
GRANDPA'S OUT AT 2:30 P.M.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.583
Do you... fuck...

24:12.333 --> 24:14.125
yourself... Do you have to...

24:16.083 --> 24:18.166
Right, they probably
give it to you for free.

24:18.250 --> 24:21.250
Right, no, I don't think so.
But don't worry.

24:22.041 --> 24:24.583
I'll pay for it. Emancipation and such.

24:24.666 --> 24:27.500
That's great.
It's good you understand that.

24:27.583 --> 24:31.375
It shows that you have
a really wicked character.

24:32.333 --> 24:35.541
That you're not just pretty
like a flower in the forest,

24:35.625 --> 24:38.833
but you have a lovely inner thing...

24:39.583 --> 24:44.041
Well, a wicked character,
overall, like a wicked princess.

24:46.666 --> 24:48.041
-Okay.
-Yeah.

24:50.250 --> 24:53.333
-So, is that a watch? It's really cool.
-Yes.

24:53.416 --> 24:58.500
It's the most... God, your arm
is beautiful! May I... It's really...

24:58.583 --> 25:00.125
Not everybody has pretty arms.

25:01.166 --> 25:04.458
You, too. Your arms are good, too.

25:04.541 --> 25:06.125
Well, yes, I'm a boxer.

25:07.125 --> 25:08.375
-Cool.
-Yeah.

25:08.458 --> 25:10.750
-So what are you doing?
-I'm a boxer.

25:12.750 --> 25:14.583
-And what do you do for a living?
-Boxing.

25:16.083 --> 25:17.000
Cool.

25:18.291 --> 25:21.208
I'm on my way
into the professional league.

25:21.291 --> 25:23.625
Yeah, exactly, and...

25:24.416 --> 25:25.958
I mean, I have one more fight

25:26.041 --> 25:29.541
and if I win that,
because I win most of the time...

25:29.625 --> 25:32.041
Last time I even broke somebody's jaw,

25:32.125 --> 25:35.791
and he nearly choked on his own blood,
so they took him to the hospital.

25:36.791 --> 25:38.916
Yeah, right.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.041
Yeah, that sounds exciting.

25:42.625 --> 25:45.958
I'm sorry. I'm so confused.

25:46.833 --> 25:49.458
Because you're so pretty.

25:50.041 --> 25:51.791
Because you're so...

25:51.875 --> 25:56.166
incredibly beautiful...
Everything there, your...

25:56.833 --> 25:58.750
Everything, especially the nose.

26:02.625 --> 26:04.791
Yikes! What are you doing here?

26:06.833 --> 26:09.041
Nice of you to visit me
at my new workplace.

26:12.000 --> 26:12.875
This is Ossi.

26:13.458 --> 26:15.125
My parents, Manfred Voigt,

26:15.625 --> 26:17.500
and Claudia Drechsler.

26:18.916 --> 26:19.916
von Eschbach...

26:20.958 --> 26:22.166
Claudia Voigt.

26:22.666 --> 26:25.625
Sorry, I always get confused
with the many names of my mother.

26:25.708 --> 26:28.291
-Who's this now?
-"Who's this now?"

26:28.375 --> 26:31.250
He's Ossi.
We're just getting to know each other.

26:31.333 --> 26:34.833
You could just ask me
and not talk about me in the third person.

26:36.416 --> 26:38.708
So would you do us the honor
of introducing yourself?

26:38.791 --> 26:41.750
She just did that,
or are you a bit deaf, man?

26:41.833 --> 26:43.916
-What kind of a stupid asshole is he?
-Pardon?

26:44.000 --> 26:46.583
-"Pardon?"
-Super...

26:47.166 --> 26:49.958
Great that we're all getting
to know each other. Who's hungry?

26:50.041 --> 26:52.750
What's this shit here? Jerk.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.541
Okay. You...

27:08.291 --> 27:09.916
You want to blackmail us, right?

27:12.166 --> 27:14.583
You set the deposit account up
for my future, right?

27:14.666 --> 27:16.041
-Yes.
-Good.

27:16.541 --> 27:19.416
The course and the apartment
in New York will be very expensive.

27:19.500 --> 27:20.625
So...

27:22.208 --> 27:25.750
You don't seriously believe
that your father and I...

27:26.416 --> 27:30.041
fought for your future for all those years
just to throw it away now?

27:33.208 --> 27:34.750
Stay right here, miss.

27:34.833 --> 27:36.708
Isi!

27:37.208 --> 27:38.791
MOM
OSSI, YOU ON THE WAY?

27:38.875 --> 27:42.041
RELAX! I'M ON MY WAY!

27:45.041 --> 27:46.500
-Wait.
-Hey!

27:46.583 --> 27:49.041
-Sorry, that was weird.
-What's with you? I need to go!

27:49.125 --> 27:51.833
-Get out!
-I have half an hour lunch break.

27:52.541 --> 27:55.125
I have no clue what's going on
with you and your parents,

27:55.208 --> 27:56.916
but I need to pick up my grandpa.

27:57.458 --> 27:58.916
-I'm coming with you.
-Are you...

27:59.000 --> 28:01.041
Get out now!

28:02.458 --> 28:04.125
Give me another chance, please.

28:04.208 --> 28:07.791
-I really need to go now, okay?
-I'm coming.

28:12.083 --> 28:13.500
Klaus, follow them.

28:15.416 --> 28:18.916
Go... Klaus! Unbelievable!

28:20.208 --> 28:21.250
Klaus! What's this?

28:21.333 --> 28:23.250
-Where are we?
-Where are we?

28:23.333 --> 28:25.333
-Follow them!
-Manfred, Isi is here.

28:25.416 --> 28:27.333
-I have it all under control.
-Isi just left!

28:27.416 --> 28:29.291
What's this with your parents?

28:29.375 --> 28:30.500
Nothing. I...

28:31.291 --> 28:34.666
It's just that...
You're different from all the...

28:35.583 --> 28:37.791
boring men I usually meet.

28:43.041 --> 28:44.833
You listen to Jedi Mind Tricks?

28:45.250 --> 28:46.833
You know Jedi Mind Tricks?

28:50.375 --> 28:51.833
Cool, you have CDs.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.500
Where are we picking up your grandpa?
At the retirement home?

29:02.166 --> 29:04.125
-You cunts.
-Grandpa.

29:04.208 --> 29:06.833
-Take care.
-Enjoy your freedom, brother.

29:09.125 --> 29:11.458
-I'm going to miss you.
-Yeah, man.

29:11.541 --> 29:12.708
Fuck.

29:12.791 --> 29:16.041
Hey, Grandpa,
are they letting you out to die?

29:16.125 --> 29:18.083
Take care, jerks!

29:24.416 --> 29:27.208
Weber, did you take a dump today,
or as you like to call it,

29:27.291 --> 29:28.250
fucked backwards?

29:28.333 --> 29:30.416
I'll keep your favorite cell free for you.

29:31.708 --> 29:34.416
Wow. You have grown so big!

29:34.500 --> 29:37.250
A real giant. Awesome!

29:39.041 --> 29:40.875
That's nice of you, but...

29:41.666 --> 29:45.458
I just spent 14 years inside. I'm not sure
I'll be able to get it up right away.

29:45.541 --> 29:48.000
You know, Grandpa, she's not a hooker.

29:48.083 --> 29:50.583
-She's your girlfriend?
-No, that's...

29:50.666 --> 29:51.875
Just to fuck, then.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.291
-Hello.
-Hi.

29:53.375 --> 29:54.375
Nice to meet you.

29:54.916 --> 29:58.000
Boy, you look so good, really!

29:58.500 --> 30:02.041
Like an Aryan wet dream!

30:02.125 --> 30:05.041
Hitler, the old fag,
would definitely get off on you.

30:05.125 --> 30:08.708
Hey, tell me, what's this shit?

30:09.750 --> 30:11.083
What have you done?

30:11.666 --> 30:13.500
Nothing but camel jockeys here!

30:13.916 --> 30:16.541
-What is this?
-We don't say "camel jockeys."

30:16.625 --> 30:17.666
What do you say now?

30:17.750 --> 30:20.458
-Weirdos or bimbos or...
-Just call them migrants.

30:20.541 --> 30:23.583
I don't see any migrants,
I only see camel jockeys.

30:23.666 --> 30:26.083
And faggots. What's with that fag?

30:26.166 --> 30:31.791
Hey! Faggot, are you a bit shy, huh?

30:31.875 --> 30:35.166
Do you not want to turn round?
Grandma!

30:35.250 --> 30:38.708
We really enjoy watching you die,
but can you--

30:38.791 --> 30:40.750
Shut your mouth right now, man!

30:40.833 --> 30:42.833
Don't act out, is that clear?

30:42.916 --> 30:46.166
Leave those people alone! You move in
with us and find a job. You hear me?

30:46.250 --> 30:48.750
Wow, you're grown into a real man.

30:49.583 --> 30:52.083
I only ever saw him as pussy-whipped.

30:52.166 --> 30:55.041
I'll tell you something else,
my best friend is an Arab.

30:55.125 --> 30:57.916
So if you insult camel jockeys again,
I'll smash your face in!

30:58.000 --> 31:00.166
-Migrants!
-But you said "camel jockeys."

31:00.250 --> 31:02.250
-Shut up!
-Besides, I already have a job.

31:02.333 --> 31:03.250
Excuse me, I--

31:03.333 --> 31:05.083
-You have a job?
-Yeah.

31:05.166 --> 31:10.958
Every single day in the cells for the last
two years, me and the brothers...

31:12.166 --> 31:13.250
rapped.

31:15.750 --> 31:17.708
-You did what?
-Yes, it's a...

31:17.791 --> 31:21.875
Well, one of them said I could take that
as a qualification because I'm very good.

31:21.958 --> 31:24.083
-You're not a rapper, man!
-But I am!

31:24.166 --> 31:29.291
-You... have no brothers, man.
-I kill those so-called gangster rappers.

31:29.375 --> 31:31.375
You're not a rapper, man!
You're a grandpa!

31:31.458 --> 31:34.500
So finally behave
like a normal grandpa, man!

31:34.583 --> 31:39.083
And now to you! I know who you are.
I saw your fucking profile.

31:39.166 --> 31:44.458
Maybe you want a real tough, trashy guy
because all those rich softies are boring,

31:44.541 --> 31:48.083
but I only came because I need €8,000
for my next fight. Do you get that?

31:48.166 --> 31:50.791
This is no date, girl.
I just wanted to fleece you.

31:50.875 --> 31:54.500
But, honestly, I've had it
with this shit. Now please, go.

31:55.291 --> 31:56.208
Okay.

31:58.083 --> 31:58.958
Bye.

32:01.500 --> 32:04.166
-Please tell me you're fucking her.
-Shut up.

32:07.000 --> 32:07.958
They're stupid.

32:08.041 --> 32:10.583
They didn't see it was
the perfect chance to kidnap you.

32:10.666 --> 32:12.250
I was really scared.

32:13.166 --> 32:15.041
It was really crass. Real trashy.

32:15.625 --> 32:17.750
-He has a CD player in the car.
-No!

32:17.833 --> 32:19.875
I want that, too. That's mega vintage.

32:22.750 --> 32:26.958
So, two cheese... one crisp...

32:27.041 --> 32:30.208
-Two crisps.
-Two crisps instead of one.

32:31.875 --> 32:36.250
Look, I invented a new burger. Try it.

32:37.250 --> 32:40.958
WATER 99%
RENDERING YOU INFERTILE

32:41.041 --> 32:42.500
It's water. You can drink it.

32:42.583 --> 32:45.041
So this Ossi admitted
he only wanted to fleece you.

32:45.125 --> 32:46.625
Did you tell him what he was in for, too?

32:46.708 --> 32:52.041
Hey. The thing... Gab...
Gabriella is burning.

32:52.833 --> 32:55.541
-Oh, God.
-Where's that thing, the...

32:55.625 --> 32:57.041
-Fire extinguisher.
-Yes!

32:57.125 --> 32:59.000
Fuck. Wait...

33:00.500 --> 33:03.041
It's not that bad.

33:10.333 --> 33:11.916
Welcome to Mannheim.

33:23.625 --> 33:26.416
HI, ISI, WE BLOCKED
YOUR DEPOSIT ACCOUNT AND CREDIT CARDS.

33:26.500 --> 33:31.791
YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANOTHER CENT UNTIL YOU
SNAP OUT OF IT. BEST WISHES, MOM AND DAD

34:15.333 --> 34:16.791
Thanks for coming.

34:22.583 --> 34:24.708
You can't pretend
it's normal for a girl like you

34:24.791 --> 34:26.875
to listen to underground music
like Jedi Mind Tricks.

34:36.041 --> 34:40.333
What happens if you can't get the money
for the fight? If boxing doesn't work out?

34:41.750 --> 34:45.041
I've been training for ten years
to get there. It will work out.

34:47.666 --> 34:51.458
You wanted to fleece me? Okay.

34:52.583 --> 34:56.041
Congratulations. I'll pay for your fight.

34:59.875 --> 35:02.083
You just need to play along
with what I want.

35:04.958 --> 35:08.833
I want us to pretend we are a couple.

35:08.916 --> 35:14.958
So my parents will give me something
that I need from them.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.958
€10,000 if it works out.

35:23.583 --> 35:25.833
-Twenty-five.
-What?

35:27.833 --> 35:29.041
You said €8,000.

35:30.125 --> 35:31.458
Now I say €25,000.

35:32.666 --> 35:33.666
My mother has debts.

35:33.750 --> 35:36.125
-€25,000 and it's a deal.
-Okay.

35:38.375 --> 35:41.166
Good. So how's this supposed to work?

35:41.750 --> 35:44.166
-...really had to endure it all in Kuwait.
-Hi.

35:44.791 --> 35:45.791
-Isi!
-Isi.

35:45.875 --> 35:49.416
-You remember Volker?
-Yes, sure. Great pictures.

35:50.291 --> 35:52.833
I just wanted to let you know
that my boyfriend,

35:52.916 --> 35:56.916
he's into art and will drop in later.
I hope that's okay?

35:57.000 --> 35:58.666
-Of course.
-Great.

35:58.750 --> 36:01.291
Your... boyfriend?

36:01.875 --> 36:04.541
-Yeah.
-Well, that's... nice.

36:06.666 --> 36:08.541
A bit clumsy of you,
but everything's fine.

36:08.625 --> 36:09.458
You've--

36:14.291 --> 36:15.875
Tschünni wanted to come, too.

36:15.958 --> 36:18.958
-Very artsy here.
-Is there any food?

36:19.041 --> 36:20.208
Yes. Over there.

36:24.833 --> 36:27.000
Excuse me, Grandpa,
this is an emergency. I'm hungry.

36:27.083 --> 36:29.875
-I'll be right back, Volker.
-It's an emergency, sorry.

36:32.958 --> 36:34.916
-Are there any fries?
-Right.

36:37.125 --> 36:40.416
Do you get this? Assholes.

36:41.666 --> 36:45.083
Asshole. Asshole. Alien asshole.

36:48.541 --> 36:51.458
That's the biggest asshole
I have seen in my life.

36:51.541 --> 36:54.166
But is it also the best? I don't know.

36:54.250 --> 36:57.625
What do you say?
Which asshole do you personally like best?

36:57.708 --> 36:59.875
An interesting interpretation.

36:59.958 --> 37:01.791
Volker, I'd like to introduce you
to somebody.

37:01.875 --> 37:03.000
Just a second.

37:03.083 --> 37:05.666
Is there anything else
you find interesting about the paintings?

37:05.750 --> 37:06.583
Absolutely.

37:06.666 --> 37:09.166
This, this, all of this shit.

37:09.250 --> 37:10.250
Tell me.

37:10.333 --> 37:12.333
-What's this?
-What's what?

37:12.791 --> 37:15.541
Is this funny? Would you like me
to pack the whole buffet for you?

37:15.625 --> 37:17.708
-Sure, go ahead, dumbass.
-I used to paint, too...

37:17.791 --> 37:20.291
-Awesome.
-...before I grew up,

37:20.375 --> 37:22.500
before I started to work
like normal people.

37:23.750 --> 37:27.625
And paid taxes and contributed stuff
to society with my work,

37:27.708 --> 37:31.041
not such rubbish just because I'm not that
impaired and still paint like a big baby.

37:34.166 --> 37:35.000
Is there a problem?

37:35.083 --> 37:36.791
Klaus!

37:38.750 --> 37:40.083
Do you have a problem with me?

37:43.833 --> 37:45.041
-Okay. I...
-You want a fight?

37:45.125 --> 37:47.875
Let's see if the training
was good for something.

37:49.208 --> 37:51.666
Okay, calm down.

37:55.708 --> 37:57.250
Thanks for the invitation.

38:03.291 --> 38:05.666
Hey, I learned a lot about art today.

38:06.458 --> 38:09.416
Well, it should at least... work, I hope.

38:10.541 --> 38:12.750
-So we have a deal?
-Yes.

38:13.750 --> 38:14.625
Hang on.

38:15.791 --> 38:18.291
-Ossi? What's up?
-I'll get the money, dumbass.

38:18.375 --> 38:19.208
Arrange the fight!

38:19.291 --> 38:20.833
-Seriously?
-Yes, man!

38:21.541 --> 38:24.208
-Where will you get the money from?
-Don't ask. Arrange the fight.

38:24.291 --> 38:27.666
It was €5,000 upfront, right?
You'll have it tomorrow.

38:27.750 --> 38:30.375
Sure. Okey-doke. By the way, Ossi,

38:30.458 --> 38:32.583
are you here with your grandpa, too?

38:32.666 --> 38:35.958
-Grandpa?
-I'm the bouncer at this hip-hop party

38:36.625 --> 38:37.833
and I've just seen your grandpa.

38:43.208 --> 38:44.666
Claudia. It's...

38:46.041 --> 38:48.166
It's completely normal, that--

38:48.250 --> 38:50.375
Completely normal, right.

38:50.458 --> 38:52.916
It's normal for a spoiled teenager
to go off,

38:53.000 --> 38:55.708
take drugs, fuck around
and want to become a chef.

38:55.791 --> 38:57.208
I wanted to say...

39:00.166 --> 39:02.666
It's completely normal that you...

39:04.500 --> 39:08.333
That you could be afraid
that Isi... like...

39:09.625 --> 39:10.875
Like your...

39:14.750 --> 39:19.375
-My what?
-My life experience is telling me that--

39:19.458 --> 39:22.625
Your life experience
is that of a money preserver.

39:22.708 --> 39:25.125
You're here to increase
your father's money.

39:25.208 --> 39:27.541
Why would you think
that you of all people can tell me--

39:27.625 --> 39:31.041
Maybe because I can empathize
far better with Isi than you can.

39:31.791 --> 39:37.208
And that's why I think that it would be
important for you to tell her...

39:38.625 --> 39:39.708
about it.

39:42.291 --> 39:45.208
You'll sleep in the green room.
I've had enough.

39:48.750 --> 39:52.791
Get lost. Go home, sleep it off
and come back then.

39:52.875 --> 39:55.625
-Dumbass, where is he?
-No clue. Look for him.

39:55.708 --> 39:57.666
Liar! I've had enough!

39:57.750 --> 40:00.500
-It's always the same with you, bitch!
-You always--

40:00.583 --> 40:03.416
Stop it right now! You can go home!

40:03.500 --> 40:04.666
Stupid bitches!

40:09.875 --> 40:12.750
Once I get you out of here
Everyone will thank me

40:12.833 --> 40:15.916
Like when the love of your life
Was your right hand

40:16.000 --> 40:19.125
Then I thought you were just broken

40:19.208 --> 40:22.083
Now I know your mother
Pays for your toothbrush

40:22.166 --> 40:24.666
You know about anal
And I'm wondering why

40:24.750 --> 40:27.750
You get nailed by truckers
Over 220 pounds

40:27.833 --> 40:30.750
Something like you

40:30.833 --> 40:34.666
-What are you doing here?
-Getting my career started.

40:34.750 --> 40:38.041
Your career? They know me here.
This is embarrassing, Grandpa.

40:38.541 --> 40:39.958
Did you not see 8 Mile?

40:42.333 --> 40:45.750
No, Grandpa, there's no 8 Mile here.

40:45.833 --> 40:49.041
-Stop that.
-You're coming with me. I beg you.

40:49.125 --> 40:50.375
Calm down, keep cool.

40:53.208 --> 40:55.041
Make some noise for Papas!

40:56.333 --> 41:00.625
Okay, not bad. And now some noise
for Katha Komben!

41:00.708 --> 41:03.041
And if it's the last thing you do, please,

41:03.125 --> 41:04.625
listen to me, just this once.

41:04.708 --> 41:08.250
And keep your hands in the air
for Atomic Dick!

41:09.958 --> 41:11.875
The champion!

41:13.000 --> 41:14.916
Along, of course, with Atomic Pussy!

41:15.000 --> 41:16.666
You're not going up there, okay?

41:16.750 --> 41:17.708
All good.

41:17.791 --> 41:20.208
-I took note of who you're battling.
-Who is it?

41:20.291 --> 41:22.291
You're battling against Legende today.

41:23.083 --> 41:25.333
-Is Legende here?
-Yes.

41:25.416 --> 41:27.250
Legende, come on up if you're here.

41:27.333 --> 41:30.708
-Legende? Where's Legende?
-Hey, Legende!

41:30.791 --> 41:33.375
Come up on the stage. Show yourself.
You're Legende?

41:34.208 --> 41:37.250
-It's a battle. You're in the wrong place.
-Are you a rapper?

41:37.916 --> 41:39.875
-What do you think?
-Can I be informal with you?

41:39.958 --> 41:41.583
Not sure. Can you or are you impaired?

41:42.291 --> 41:43.375
Okay, then.

41:43.458 --> 41:46.500
We were all laughing, but if you're sure.

41:46.583 --> 41:48.916
-He starts off and you fill in.
-Stop annoying me.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.916
Make way! Give us a beat!

41:54.041 --> 41:55.583
Yeah, okay!

41:55.666 --> 41:57.750
This is your last meal, sunshine!

41:57.833 --> 41:59.375
This old fart must be from--

42:01.500 --> 42:03.250
Hey, dude, chill!

42:03.333 --> 42:07.541
-Hey, old fart, are you crazy?
-Yeah, okay. I know.

42:07.625 --> 42:09.583
It was an accidental slip.

42:11.416 --> 42:13.916
Hey, don't be a girl. Keep going.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.250
I didn't even feel it,
but you should be kicked out.

42:16.333 --> 42:18.750
-Just keep going.
-Will we keep going?

42:18.833 --> 42:21.083
-Yeah, it's okay.
-Turn the beat back on.

42:21.166 --> 42:23.416
Old people sometimes
can't control themselves.

42:23.500 --> 42:25.083
We're cool about it.

42:25.166 --> 42:26.333
Okay, try it another way.

42:27.166 --> 42:29.750
Grandpa seems to have escaped
From the retirement home

42:29.833 --> 42:32.750
Do you even know what this is?
It's called a microphone

42:32.833 --> 42:35.625
That's how I fuck all my enemies
Without a condom

42:35.708 --> 42:38.791
Then I jump over them
Right onto my throne

42:38.875 --> 42:41.666
Are you still listening
Is your hearing aid turned on?

42:41.750 --> 42:43.666
Read my lips, Grandpa...

42:43.750 --> 42:44.916
Suck my dick.

42:45.000 --> 42:49.958
This is Atomic Pussy, my sister
She's taking over for me now

42:50.041 --> 42:52.541
This will be tough
What are you doing here at all?

42:52.625 --> 42:55.583
Are you not far too old?
I gave the retirement home a call

42:55.666 --> 42:57.125
They'll take you back by force

43:02.625 --> 43:04.291
Make some noise!

43:04.375 --> 43:07.500
-Let's go.
-Never. I'm enjoying this.

43:08.083 --> 43:10.250
Legende, Grandpa,
you need to start right away.

43:10.333 --> 43:13.583
Can you do your shopping list tomorrow?
It's your turn to rap.

43:13.666 --> 43:15.625
The beat is on.
You need to rap now, man.

43:15.708 --> 43:17.958
The beat is on. You need to start now.

43:18.041 --> 43:19.916
-Do something!
-Your grandpa wants to live.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.833
-Get started or you're finished.
-Okay.

43:22.916 --> 43:24.500
-You got it.
-Come on.

43:25.541 --> 43:28.375
Okay, Legende,
now is your chance to convince us, dude.

43:32.541 --> 43:35.541
You call me an old fart
And you're absolutely right

43:35.625 --> 43:38.375
'Cause I fucked your granny
At the times of Bertolt Brecht

43:38.458 --> 43:41.625
In the '60s I was a hippie
Fucking other relatives

43:41.708 --> 43:44.625
When I was high on acid
Even once your uncle at Lake Placid

43:44.708 --> 43:47.416
When we met first, brother
You were still inside your mother

43:47.500 --> 43:50.833
And since you've met my cock that often
You've ended up such a cocksucker

43:50.916 --> 43:56.916
The Wall came down, you were ugly and tiny
I slid into the rest of your damn family

43:57.000 --> 44:01.166
Not your sister, just to be clear
I would never touch her

44:01.916 --> 44:03.208
Can't fuck my own child

44:10.291 --> 44:13.708
-Okay, I don't think anyone expected that.
-Okay, that wasn't bad.

44:14.958 --> 44:17.541
But don't forget who is the champ!
Make a wave!

44:17.625 --> 44:22.458
-Hey, who is the winner now?
-We'll decide in a second round.

44:22.541 --> 44:24.625
First I'm going to have a drink
with my grandson.

44:26.041 --> 44:27.250
Hey, come back!

44:27.333 --> 44:31.416
Where did your good mood vanish to?
Smile a bit. That was such a cool show!

44:31.500 --> 44:34.166
Not even us could do that.
I'd love to have a grandpa like that.

44:34.250 --> 44:37.208
Just give him a chance.
He's even getting us beer.

44:37.708 --> 44:39.500
That was so cool!
What's wrong with you?

44:39.583 --> 44:43.250
Bernhard Knecht, who's that?
Is that another Hitler or something?

44:43.333 --> 44:44.958
Who is this faggot anyway?

44:45.041 --> 44:47.000
You don't say "faggot" anymore,
it's "hipster" now.

44:47.083 --> 44:49.583
-That's Tschünni.
-Hi, Tschünni.

44:49.666 --> 44:51.041
Hi, Grandpa Ossi.

44:51.125 --> 44:53.333
I got the video from the guy
who was filming it.

44:53.416 --> 44:56.250
And a friend of mine, Camilla,
has a PR manager.

44:56.333 --> 44:59.250
Call him and show him the video.
He loves stuff like that.

44:59.333 --> 45:01.541
Stop being so formal. What's this?

45:01.625 --> 45:04.875
Are they crazy? Those bottles are
only half full. Assholes.

45:04.958 --> 45:07.625
PR manager scam!
How long have you been rapping for?

45:07.708 --> 45:10.666
It's really cool. That age and...

45:10.750 --> 45:13.500
He even reacted spontaneously to the guy.

45:13.583 --> 45:15.375
Your grandpa is actually intelligent.

45:18.125 --> 45:19.250
Yeah, right.

45:20.375 --> 45:22.875
He's been putting down people
all his life. He's good at that.

45:22.958 --> 45:25.708
-No, he's really clever.
-Look.

45:25.791 --> 45:28.333
He went to jail
for shooting someone in the foot.

45:28.416 --> 45:30.250
He was supposed to get out
after four years,

45:30.333 --> 45:32.291
but he hit someone
and got another two years.

45:32.375 --> 45:35.125
Then he was out for a week,
but couldn't deal with it

45:35.208 --> 45:37.250
and robbed a bank.
Thing is, it wasn't a bank,

45:37.333 --> 45:39.625
just a post office,
and he stole fucking stamps.

45:39.708 --> 45:42.583
All in all, he spent 14 years in jail
for stupid shit.

45:43.791 --> 45:46.166
Does that sound like
an intelligent man to you?

45:57.166 --> 45:59.000
Will you transfer the €5,000
to me straightaway?

46:01.791 --> 46:03.916
-I wanted to talk to you about that.
-What?

46:04.000 --> 46:07.208
-My parents blocked my accounts.
-What's this?

46:07.291 --> 46:09.958
-But we'll manage. My parents--
-Are you fucking with me?

46:10.041 --> 46:12.125
I need this money
by the day after tomorrow!

46:12.208 --> 46:13.041
We...

46:13.750 --> 46:16.875
-We'll go to my place and then...
-Then what?

46:17.875 --> 46:20.000
We just need to apply some pressure.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.375
This is the only way
to get into the house unseen.

46:31.958 --> 46:33.333
Turn on the light.

46:34.583 --> 46:36.375
Just turn on the light for a second.

46:36.458 --> 46:39.458
-No!
-Turn on the light. Just for a second.

46:45.416 --> 46:46.833
Holy fuck!

46:51.750 --> 46:52.875
Shut up!

46:54.208 --> 46:55.958
-How rich are you?
-Not a clue.

46:56.041 --> 46:58.791
Come on, I'll show you something.

47:04.791 --> 47:05.666
Seven thousand.

47:07.958 --> 47:09.458
Eighteen thousand.

47:10.125 --> 47:14.333
-Sweet. Just this and we'd have not debts.
-One hundred and fifty-two...

47:24.208 --> 47:25.916
Twenty-five thousand, okay?

47:26.000 --> 47:29.333
Something goes wrong, I'll smuggle
these out and you'll get your money.

47:33.041 --> 47:34.666
Why does your mother have debts?

47:36.708 --> 47:39.916
We have a gas station.
Her debts are €14,000.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.291
I owe the bank €3,000 for that, too.

47:42.375 --> 47:44.500
-You took out a loan for it?
-Yes.

47:45.791 --> 47:48.583
No idea. The station is all my mother has.

47:53.166 --> 47:54.666
Antique sex toys.

47:57.625 --> 48:00.083
What... I get the dildo, but...

48:00.666 --> 48:01.833
What's this for?

48:04.916 --> 48:06.083
You can try it out.

48:07.375 --> 48:08.875
It's all because of this.

48:10.333 --> 48:13.416
My grandpa invented it with 22.
For engines.

48:14.041 --> 48:15.000
Fuck.

48:16.833 --> 48:18.708
All of this for a screw?

48:21.625 --> 48:22.625
Fuck me.

48:31.166 --> 48:32.791
Hey, how big is this here?

48:35.000 --> 48:36.375
Where are your parents?

48:38.708 --> 48:40.791
Yeah, we... We need to

48:42.041 --> 48:43.625
get some attention.

48:45.500 --> 48:48.958
-I don't want to push you into anything.
-No. It's all good.

48:49.041 --> 48:52.166
You need your money. We'll just do it.

48:52.250 --> 48:55.625
-It needs to be authentic, right?
-Yes.

48:57.750 --> 48:59.833
-Okay, let's practice.
-What?

49:01.000 --> 49:03.083
What is it? It was your idea.

49:04.291 --> 49:06.625
Yeah. Okay.

49:07.833 --> 49:11.750
So... can you please
kiss me really trashy?

49:11.833 --> 49:13.291
-Kiss you trashy?
-Yes.

49:14.083 --> 49:15.208
Trashy.

49:16.583 --> 49:17.875
Just trashy.

49:18.958 --> 49:20.708
I can only kiss well, sorry.

49:23.458 --> 49:25.833
-Wait...
-What?

49:25.916 --> 49:29.541
Why are you pushing me like...
You... kiss really funny.

49:30.625 --> 49:32.375
I don't kiss funny, okay?

49:32.625 --> 49:35.125
I had a girlfriend before
who didn't even like me.

49:35.208 --> 49:37.416
She was just with me
'cause I can kiss so well.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.833
-Okay. Congratulations.
-Thanks.

49:40.916 --> 49:42.583
Okay, then...

49:43.708 --> 49:46.125
-Just push me against the stupid door.
-Yeah.

49:46.208 --> 49:47.041
Yeah.

50:21.833 --> 50:24.416
Okay, great, it's working. Great.

50:27.500 --> 50:28.541
Okay.

50:40.041 --> 50:42.041
-What... Stop!
-What is it?

50:42.125 --> 50:43.583
-What?
-Enough.

50:48.666 --> 50:50.708
-What are you doing?
-Hey!

50:51.833 --> 50:54.291
-Just let me do it.
-Just...

50:54.375 --> 50:58.625
I can do it myself. Okay, fine.

51:00.458 --> 51:03.125
-What are you doing?
-I'm taking off my shoes.

51:10.083 --> 51:12.000
Can you do it? Yes?

51:15.416 --> 51:16.916
This is so crazy.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.916
Is this the craziest stuff
you've ever done?

51:20.333 --> 51:24.041
-I drove backwards into McDrive once.
-You drove backwards...

51:52.958 --> 51:54.041
That's enough!

51:54.625 --> 51:56.250
Could you knock?

51:56.333 --> 51:58.833
-Enough, Isabelle!
-Hey, careful!

51:58.916 --> 52:00.625
With a monkey! Give it a rest!

52:00.708 --> 52:02.583
Ossi and me are a couple. Deal with it.

52:02.666 --> 52:04.833
-I can fool myself.
-You don't believe it?

52:05.708 --> 52:07.833
Get out! Out of my house!

52:07.916 --> 52:09.375
Ossi stays!

52:09.458 --> 52:12.583
Just because you can't understand
that two people can fall in love

52:12.666 --> 52:14.208
and be together. Yes, Dad.

52:14.291 --> 52:18.166
It's true, some women are with men
because they fell in love with them!

52:18.250 --> 52:20.541
I know that's against your system! Sorry.

52:22.625 --> 52:23.833
I'm sorry!

52:23.916 --> 52:25.250
Ossi, nothing happened.

52:26.708 --> 52:27.916
I'm sorry, I just...

52:29.625 --> 52:31.125
-I'm moving in with Ossi.
-What?

52:31.208 --> 52:32.416
What?

53:20.041 --> 53:20.875
Hi, Mom.

53:21.666 --> 53:23.333
Mom, this is Isi.

53:24.250 --> 53:25.250
Hello.

53:28.333 --> 53:29.375
Nice to meet you.

53:31.416 --> 53:34.000
Okay. Here.

53:42.625 --> 53:46.000
-The death glare.
-My mom is okay.

53:46.083 --> 53:47.416
Just forget it.

53:48.208 --> 53:50.750
Okay, you sleep here, I sleep over there.

53:55.791 --> 53:58.750
MESSAGE TO CAMILLA
CAN I CRASH AT YOUR PLACE?

53:58.833 --> 54:01.916
What do you want from your parents? Money?

54:06.541 --> 54:10.375
They set up a deposit account for me
that I'm supposed to get when I'm 25.

54:10.458 --> 54:12.541
But I want it now because...

54:14.708 --> 54:16.791
Because I don't want to go to college.

54:17.166 --> 54:18.875
I want to train to be a chef.

54:21.166 --> 54:22.000
Cool.

54:23.708 --> 54:24.708
Yeah, I...

54:25.916 --> 54:29.666
-I think I would enjoy that a lot.
-It's a mega cool job.

54:31.750 --> 54:32.750
Thanks.

54:34.875 --> 54:37.833
For not laughing at my problems.

54:39.833 --> 54:41.833
You're just confirming my theory.

54:42.833 --> 54:45.291
That rich people
are too stupid to be happy.

54:46.083 --> 54:49.666
Okay. Then explain that.

54:50.250 --> 54:51.666
Why am I not happy?

54:53.791 --> 54:56.166
When you're rich,
you can do anything you want.

54:56.250 --> 54:57.875
But you don't because you're impaired.

54:59.333 --> 55:00.541
But I'm doing what I want.

55:01.791 --> 55:03.541
Training to be a chef in New York.

55:03.625 --> 55:07.041
Maybe you can cook something here.
But we only have shit.

55:13.041 --> 55:15.333
No clue if those spices are still good.

55:22.416 --> 55:25.208
Okay. This is a challenge.

55:28.375 --> 55:31.416
All of a sudden, she is in front of me
and she wasn't just fat.

55:31.500 --> 55:35.375
I swear, she had such a belly, I swear,
down to her thighs.

55:35.458 --> 55:38.291
And you congratulate her on her pregnancy
without knowing for sure.

55:38.375 --> 55:41.083
-You just wanted to annoy her.
-No!

55:41.166 --> 55:43.708
-She was pregnant!
-But I know her. She's fat.

55:43.791 --> 55:47.208
-And Tschünni still only jerks off to you.
-Stop it.

55:47.291 --> 55:49.541
Okay, I'm now officially gay.

55:49.625 --> 55:51.625
-Hi, Grandpa.
-What's going on?

55:51.708 --> 55:53.666
-Cooking?
-Okay, so you're gay now.

55:53.750 --> 55:57.583
-A gay rapper.
-I was waiting 45 minutes at the optician.

55:57.666 --> 56:00.833
-Then he called a lesbian first.
-Stop talking shit.

56:00.916 --> 56:05.458
If you need to be gay in order
to get served, then I'm gay.

56:05.541 --> 56:07.875
Maybe they just thought you are homeless.

56:07.958 --> 56:09.458
You weren't there.

56:09.541 --> 56:12.625
By the way, the PR jerk thought
my video was really cool.

56:12.708 --> 56:15.166
He had seen it before,
on the Internet or something.

56:15.250 --> 56:16.791
Really? Cool.

56:24.125 --> 56:26.125
I've just spent 14 years in jail...

56:27.125 --> 56:30.708
and this is by far the ugliest dinner
I've ever seen.

56:30.791 --> 56:32.583
Try it first.

56:43.875 --> 56:44.791
It's actually tasty.

56:45.375 --> 56:47.500
Somehow it is.

56:47.583 --> 56:49.916
-That shit isn't bad.
-How did you do that?

56:50.333 --> 56:52.666
Really nice.

56:52.750 --> 56:53.833
Thanks.

56:55.750 --> 56:57.416
Is there any more?

56:58.166 --> 56:59.000
Sure.

57:18.875 --> 57:21.708
DAD
3 MISSED CALLS

58:12.250 --> 58:13.500
Good night.

58:15.666 --> 58:18.625
Good night, Camilla and Isi.

58:23.458 --> 58:27.083
The granny of a friend died last night.
I didn't want to wake you.

58:27.166 --> 58:28.333
Shit.

58:28.416 --> 58:29.791
Emotional support, huh?

58:30.833 --> 58:32.750
Do you always eat your Nutella
with a roll?

58:32.833 --> 58:34.000
Sometimes.

58:34.083 --> 58:35.083
Did you enjoy it?

58:38.958 --> 58:40.333
I noticed something.

58:40.958 --> 58:42.208
You're an asshole.

58:43.625 --> 58:44.666
It's true.

58:45.333 --> 58:46.666
You're totally unfriendly.

58:47.458 --> 58:50.000
You don't say "Enjoy your meal"
or "Cheers"

58:50.083 --> 58:52.333
or "Bless you" when someone sneezes.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.833
I thought the rich were at least friendly.

58:55.500 --> 58:58.500
She didn't even notice I didn't reply.
She doesn't care.

58:58.583 --> 59:02.208
So, you're an asshole
because you assume others are, too.

59:02.291 --> 59:04.583
I can't say things like that.
I never could.

59:05.291 --> 59:10.041
Why do you say "Enjoy your meal," huh?
"Enjoy your meal"?

59:10.708 --> 59:14.916
The worst is when my parents have wine
in the evening and clink glasses and go,

59:16.541 --> 59:18.041
"À votre santé."

59:18.125 --> 59:20.458
-Total jerks. Oh, my God.
-Seriously.

59:20.541 --> 59:23.791
When someone sneezes, I want to say,
"Sneeze less loudly. That's gross."

59:23.875 --> 59:28.041
Because people just say it
without meaning it.

59:28.125 --> 59:29.916
Yeah, maybe.

59:31.583 --> 59:34.583
-I can count letters.
-I don't get that transition.

59:34.666 --> 59:37.625
You say something weird,
then I say something weird.

59:37.708 --> 59:39.041
What does "counting letters" mean?

59:39.125 --> 59:41.500
-Say a word.
-Word.

59:41.583 --> 59:45.458
-No, a long word.
-Declaration.

59:46.625 --> 59:48.333
-Eleven.
-What? Letters?

59:50.916 --> 59:54.500
-Discontinuity.
-It needs to be a word I know.

59:56.416 --> 59:58.041
Apple-juice-tree.

59:59.833 --> 1:00:04.208
-Fourteen. What's that supposed to be?
-Peanut-butter-resistant.

1:00:04.750 --> 1:00:06.625
-Peanut with two Ts?
-No, with one.

1:00:07.458 --> 1:00:08.666
Twenty-one.

1:00:16.041 --> 1:00:19.125
No clue. I just can.
It's like a compulsion.

1:00:20.083 --> 1:00:23.041
There was this damn show,
what was it called?

1:00:23.125 --> 1:00:25.291
-Wanna Bet?
-Yes, exactly.

1:00:25.375 --> 1:00:27.791
Right. As a child, I wanted to go there.

1:00:28.500 --> 1:00:30.541
What else would that shit be good for?

1:00:34.291 --> 1:00:35.166
What?

1:00:37.083 --> 1:00:38.625
You're taking after your grandpa.

1:00:41.666 --> 1:00:45.625
-I'm now also very intelligent?
-Well...

1:00:46.708 --> 1:00:49.208
If you or your grandpa
had grown up like me...

1:00:49.916 --> 1:00:51.625
with all the fucking money,

1:00:52.250 --> 1:00:56.416
the school, the support,
then, I don't know,

1:00:56.500 --> 1:00:59.750
you would study astrophysics
and not do this shit.

1:01:00.458 --> 1:01:03.083
What shit? I don't do shit, I box.

1:01:03.583 --> 1:01:06.375
I'll show you how I do shit. Come on.

1:01:06.958 --> 1:01:08.916
They mentioned us in Manager Magazin.

1:01:09.541 --> 1:01:12.291
Among the 50 richest families in Germany.

1:01:13.208 --> 1:01:15.791
We can't let them get away with this.
It'll be a hefty lawsuit.

1:01:15.875 --> 1:01:19.166
-Centered, it needs to be centered.
-I already have the lawyers here.

1:01:19.250 --> 1:01:22.583
Now, of all times, while Isi is
with that trashy guy in Mannheim,

1:01:22.666 --> 1:01:24.916
practically a sitting duck for kidnappers.

1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.833
Manfred, it's really funny.
We miscalculated a little.

1:01:27.916 --> 1:01:31.083
You have around 27 million more
than the last estimate.

1:01:31.166 --> 1:01:32.708
You're not supposed to make us richer

1:01:32.791 --> 1:01:35.125
but to pretend we're just
normal boring multimillionaires.

1:01:35.625 --> 1:01:36.791
Christ!

1:01:36.875 --> 1:01:38.208
-Manfred.
-Sorry.

1:01:38.291 --> 1:01:41.166
You want to give her €3,000 a month?

1:01:41.250 --> 1:01:43.291
Yes, if she goes to college.

1:01:43.375 --> 1:01:46.041
Plus the best cooking class

1:01:46.125 --> 1:01:48.541
available near the college.
Can't hurt, right?

1:01:48.625 --> 1:01:50.250
Maybe that will make her see sense.

1:01:50.333 --> 1:01:53.875
Right, left, very good. Great!

1:01:53.958 --> 1:01:55.958
Your cover, where's your cover?

1:01:57.833 --> 1:01:58.875
Well done!

1:02:00.708 --> 1:02:04.250
-Too skippy.
-Okay. Very good.

1:02:06.500 --> 1:02:07.416
That'll make you sick.

1:02:07.500 --> 1:02:10.041
-What did he say?
-Not a clue.

1:02:17.541 --> 1:02:18.916
Right, okay.

1:02:20.750 --> 1:02:22.375
I think I should do some serious training.

1:02:22.458 --> 1:02:25.166
Ossi! You need to go
to the gas station sooner.

1:02:25.250 --> 1:02:28.416
I need to drop into the workshop
for the electric pump.

1:02:28.500 --> 1:02:30.916
I haven't trained properly yet.
I can't go.

1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.291
Sorry, but it can't be helped.
It's important.

1:02:35.458 --> 1:02:36.625
Hello?

1:02:37.875 --> 1:02:39.833
Is there anything else, young man?

1:02:42.208 --> 1:02:44.583
Right. No worries.

1:02:47.208 --> 1:02:49.166
-You work there?
-Part time.

1:02:50.333 --> 1:02:52.916
And that's not a problem
for becoming a pro?

1:02:53.458 --> 1:02:55.875
-I have to.
-Party tonight.

1:02:56.416 --> 1:02:57.416
Right?

1:02:58.833 --> 1:03:01.083
You come, too, Isi. Party tonight.

1:03:01.166 --> 1:03:03.125
You want me to pay for everything,
but I don't have any.

1:03:03.208 --> 1:03:07.416
In Mannheim you don't need money to party.
Sorry, the rich don't know how to party.

1:03:07.500 --> 1:03:09.791
-Of course I do.
-Then join us tonight.

1:03:09.875 --> 1:03:12.083
And no ten hours of beauty sleep.

1:03:12.166 --> 1:03:13.833
DAD

1:03:17.791 --> 1:03:18.833
Isi?

1:03:21.416 --> 1:03:24.041
She declined my call. I'll ring Klaus.

1:03:24.916 --> 1:03:26.166
Turn that shit off.

1:03:26.250 --> 1:03:27.958
Just the canister today.

1:03:28.958 --> 1:03:30.125
Keep the change.

1:03:31.083 --> 1:03:32.166
Ciao.

1:03:54.916 --> 1:03:56.916
ALL FILL UP AT BETTY'S

1:04:01.458 --> 1:04:02.416
Ossi!

1:04:02.875 --> 1:04:05.958
What are you doing?
We're open for another 20 minutes.

1:04:06.041 --> 1:04:08.791
There's nobody coming, anyway.
I need to go. I'm meeting people.

1:04:08.875 --> 1:04:12.041
Rubbish, open up!
I wanted to show Grandpa the station.

1:04:12.958 --> 1:04:16.750
-Hey!
-"All fill up at Betty's," great.

1:04:18.875 --> 1:04:20.083
Yeah.

1:04:20.833 --> 1:04:22.916
This shit is not that bad.

1:04:24.083 --> 1:04:27.333
And that's
where the electric pump will go.

1:04:27.416 --> 1:04:30.625
Right. Sci-Fi. They can charge
their Internet there, too, huh?

1:04:31.958 --> 1:04:32.791
Yeah.

1:04:33.375 --> 1:04:36.791
You really have built something here,
my daughter. Business.

1:04:36.875 --> 1:04:38.958
Clink, clink. And the money rolls in.

1:04:39.708 --> 1:04:42.416
-Really cool.
-You can stay. I'm off.

1:04:42.500 --> 1:04:44.625
Wait, Oscar. Where's the party?

1:04:44.708 --> 1:04:48.416
-Nowhere for you, man.
-Come on, there's something to celebrate.

1:04:49.625 --> 1:04:51.125
I got a record deal!

1:04:51.208 --> 1:04:55.583
-Don't talk shit, man.
-No shit. A record deal and a producer.

1:04:57.041 --> 1:04:58.833
Yes, I have a record deal.

1:04:59.958 --> 1:05:02.583
-Seriously?
-Where's the party?

1:05:33.666 --> 1:05:34.708
Can we have shots?

1:05:49.916 --> 1:05:50.833
Hey!

1:05:50.916 --> 1:05:52.916
-Are you happy?
-What?

1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:54.750
-Are you happy?
-Yes.

1:05:54.833 --> 1:05:58.625
See that woman there?
She gave me her number.

1:05:58.708 --> 1:06:00.541
-I'll send her a dick pic.
-Hey!

1:06:00.625 --> 1:06:02.125
Are you crazy? Stop it!

1:06:04.250 --> 1:06:09.500
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
A dick pic is an honest thing.

1:06:09.583 --> 1:06:13.208
You know why? She'll know what she gets.

1:06:14.041 --> 1:06:15.583
What does your father do?

1:06:15.666 --> 1:06:17.416
-Construction.
-And your mother?

1:06:18.291 --> 1:06:21.708
Don't ask about my mother
while I'm sending a pic of my dick!

1:06:21.791 --> 1:06:24.916
What does your mom do?
What's her name? Do you like your mom?

1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:28.000
Shut up and pay attention to her reaction.

1:06:28.083 --> 1:06:30.583
-You'll learn something.
-You're lucky if she doesn't report you.

1:06:30.666 --> 1:06:31.916
Just wait.

1:06:37.250 --> 1:06:38.750
MOM

1:06:42.375 --> 1:06:45.875
-Don't talk about my mom!
-But you can see whether she's seen it!

1:06:45.958 --> 1:06:48.166
Mom has no fucking WhatsApp.
That was an MMS.

1:06:48.250 --> 1:06:51.791
Are you worried she might see your dick
or that she'll send you a pic back?

1:06:57.416 --> 1:07:00.083
-Is he there?
-There he is. Tschünni!

1:07:00.166 --> 1:07:01.833
Tschünni, man! Hey!

1:07:01.916 --> 1:07:03.708
Check on the table.

1:07:03.791 --> 1:07:05.125
On the table, man!

1:07:05.791 --> 1:07:07.875
Table, man! Table!

1:07:07.958 --> 1:07:11.000
Turn round!

1:07:11.083 --> 1:07:13.791
Now she is there. Oh, fuck.

1:07:17.458 --> 1:07:18.583
Oh, boy.

1:07:19.708 --> 1:07:22.958
-Run!
-She's seen it!

1:07:57.250 --> 1:08:00.333
Well, there's that really awesome
boxing management in Frankfurt.

1:08:00.416 --> 1:08:01.666
Then you have to go there.

1:08:01.750 --> 1:08:03.166
It's not possible.

1:08:03.791 --> 1:08:06.625
Ossi, do you believe in your talent?

1:08:06.708 --> 1:08:09.958
Do you really seriously
believe in your talent?

1:08:10.041 --> 1:08:13.083
Then you have... You can't always stay
in that gas station.

1:08:13.166 --> 1:08:14.875
Why are you so interested in that?

1:08:14.958 --> 1:08:18.291
I have fans in Mannheim.
That's a good foundation, isn't it?

1:08:18.375 --> 1:08:20.750
Why... What do you want from me?

1:08:24.541 --> 1:08:26.833
Nothing will come of us.
We might as well make out.

1:08:33.500 --> 1:08:37.666
She knows Klaus was filming.
Come on, this is staged.

1:09:20.458 --> 1:09:22.916
-Okay?
-Fuck. Please.

1:09:25.708 --> 1:09:27.958
Where are my fucking spices?

1:09:28.041 --> 1:09:31.041
Have you lost it? What's wrong with you?

1:09:31.125 --> 1:09:34.416
-Mom!
-Do you know what time it is? It's late.

1:09:34.500 --> 1:09:36.083
Are you drunk?

1:09:36.166 --> 1:09:38.291
If you're not up to the mark tomorrow,

1:09:38.375 --> 1:09:41.375
you'll be at the station.
I don't care if you're having a bad day.

1:09:41.458 --> 1:09:44.333
-Give me a kiss.
-You stink, asshole.

1:09:44.416 --> 1:09:47.000
Isabella, why did you take
your T-shirt off?

1:09:47.083 --> 1:09:50.750
Because I'm warm. What a stupid question.

1:09:50.833 --> 1:09:52.625
I don't think your mom likes me.

1:09:52.708 --> 1:09:56.666
My mom loves you,
but she has a problem with Illuminati.

1:09:56.750 --> 1:09:58.500
I'm no Illuminati.

1:09:58.583 --> 1:10:01.208
All millionaires are Illuminati, bitch.

1:10:01.291 --> 1:10:06.750
No. You're just jealous we're rich
and you're not. Go cry.

1:10:06.833 --> 1:10:10.583
And actually, we're billionaires, bitches.

1:10:11.458 --> 1:10:13.708
Fuck, man!

1:10:17.416 --> 1:10:19.291
What did you do to me?

1:10:22.291 --> 1:10:25.208
What did you do to me? I was never...

1:10:25.708 --> 1:10:27.625
-drunk.
-Yeah, right.

1:10:57.833 --> 1:11:02.791
We used to have a picture like that
in my parents' bedroom.

1:11:05.041 --> 1:11:06.458
They were lying like this.

1:11:10.250 --> 1:11:11.791
So close and cuddling.

1:11:15.625 --> 1:11:17.833
As a child, I thought that was weird.

1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:20.125
I thought...

1:11:21.166 --> 1:11:22.500
something was wrong.

1:11:23.750 --> 1:11:25.166
Why were they lying like that?

1:11:27.291 --> 1:11:28.708
They never do that otherwise.

1:11:34.375 --> 1:11:36.333
It was so strange.

1:13:08.083 --> 1:13:10.750
Hey. Wake up.

1:13:12.375 --> 1:13:13.208
Hello.

1:13:22.458 --> 1:13:23.750
Your parents are here.

1:13:38.250 --> 1:13:39.666
Yes?

1:13:43.666 --> 1:13:45.416
Okay. Isi, you win.

1:13:46.750 --> 1:13:48.458
Please come home with us now.

1:13:49.083 --> 1:13:51.541
You'll get your deposit account,
all of the money.

1:13:54.333 --> 1:13:55.416
No more provocations.

1:13:57.625 --> 1:14:00.875
Understood? Good, get your things.

1:14:01.458 --> 1:14:02.416
Right, okay.

1:14:04.166 --> 1:14:06.791
I need to go to work first.
I should be fair

1:14:06.875 --> 1:14:09.041
and stay on for a few days,
until they find someone else.

1:14:10.041 --> 1:14:11.750
Okay, yeah. That's fine.

1:14:13.541 --> 1:14:15.666
But this... is over.

1:14:15.750 --> 1:14:17.791
Tell me that this is over.

1:14:19.833 --> 1:14:22.166
Yeah, sure.

1:14:27.041 --> 1:14:28.458
Fine.

1:14:30.125 --> 1:14:32.000
-Well, then...
-Then...

1:14:52.250 --> 1:14:55.708
MONEY TRANSFER

1:14:58.041 --> 1:15:01.250
Okay. It's working again.
I've transferred it to you.

1:15:10.166 --> 1:15:11.500
Ossi.

1:15:14.375 --> 1:15:16.791
Are you really sure you don't want...

1:15:17.708 --> 1:15:19.958
to use the money for your career?

1:15:21.541 --> 1:15:23.416
Is this your last advice before you go?

1:15:28.708 --> 1:15:29.541
Forget it.

1:15:29.625 --> 1:15:32.416
What's the billionaire's suggestion
of how I should invest my money?

1:15:32.500 --> 1:15:35.416
Did you just seriously suggest
I abandon my mom?

1:15:36.291 --> 1:15:38.166
Ossi, you've already
incurred debts for her.

1:15:38.250 --> 1:15:42.750
You're not used to that, right? A family
sticking together to make ends meet.

1:15:48.666 --> 1:15:49.875
Forget what I said.

1:15:50.458 --> 1:15:53.250
Okay. Will you leave or...

1:15:53.333 --> 1:15:54.791
Why are you so aggressive?

1:15:55.708 --> 1:15:57.416
Because I'm sick of it, okay?

1:15:59.041 --> 1:16:01.125
I'm sick of people like you.

1:16:02.916 --> 1:16:06.333
You have no idea what it means to my mom,
who never had anything,

1:16:06.958 --> 1:16:10.000
and had such a father,
and had to raise me on her own,

1:16:10.083 --> 1:16:14.458
what it means to her to have something.
But to arrive here and fucking...

1:16:22.666 --> 1:16:25.625
I'm sorry for what I said.

1:16:27.875 --> 1:16:28.833
Bye.

1:16:31.083 --> 1:16:32.166
Okay...

1:16:33.333 --> 1:16:35.416
-We don't have to--
-Hey, no issues.

1:16:35.500 --> 1:16:38.625
You have your money, I have mine.
Everybody's happy.

1:16:39.166 --> 1:16:40.416
Enjoy New York.

1:16:42.875 --> 1:16:43.708
Bye.

1:17:32.458 --> 1:17:33.500
Watch out!

1:17:36.708 --> 1:17:37.875
Are you okay?

1:17:40.083 --> 1:17:41.916
Marf.

1:17:43.500 --> 1:17:45.125
How much longer do you want to wait?

1:17:46.250 --> 1:17:47.958
Until Gabriella kills someone?

1:17:50.458 --> 1:17:52.291
Hey, call me?

1:17:52.875 --> 1:17:55.916
Yeah... Gabriella, get changed.

1:17:56.458 --> 1:17:57.916
You're fired.

1:18:12.541 --> 1:18:14.166
Well? Now like this.

1:18:15.500 --> 1:18:17.166
Now duck in.

1:18:18.333 --> 1:18:22.208
Now what's this? Show some moves!
Step on it! Go on!

1:18:22.291 --> 1:18:25.958
Properly! Proper hits!
Are you asleep? What are you doing?

1:18:26.041 --> 1:18:27.916
Come on, three undercuts! Come on!

1:18:30.791 --> 1:18:34.000
Ossi, Vukovic will beat you to a pulp!

1:18:34.083 --> 1:18:35.541
What's wrong with you?

1:19:01.166 --> 1:19:04.000
The deposit account is closed.
You have access to the money now.

1:19:05.875 --> 1:19:08.083
You make your own decisions now.

1:19:09.458 --> 1:19:11.625
And I hope you'll act responsibly.

1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:22.333
OVERVIEW OF FINANCES

1:19:41.583 --> 1:19:44.375
AGGREGATE BALANCE

1:19:44.458 --> 1:19:45.875
ANONYMOUS DONATION

1:20:02.958 --> 1:20:03.916
MONEY TRANSFERRED

1:20:08.208 --> 1:20:11.250
LEGENDE - FOREIGNERS EVERYWHERE
(OFFICIAL VIDEO)

1:20:16.750 --> 1:20:18.125
They're everywhere!

1:20:18.208 --> 1:20:21.458
Was I really in jail
Or just sitting in long-distance traffic

1:20:21.541 --> 1:20:24.458
I don't recognize anything
As if I was in Cambodia

1:20:24.541 --> 1:20:25.375
FOREIGNERS

1:20:25.458 --> 1:20:27.833
Foreigners, foreigners, such shit

1:20:27.916 --> 1:20:31.208
I feel like I'm on a world trip
In my own country

1:20:31.291 --> 1:20:33.208
-That guy is nice
-Holidays around the corner

1:20:33.291 --> 1:20:35.750
Camel jockeys are migrants

1:20:35.833 --> 1:20:37.250
No matter what color

1:20:37.333 --> 1:20:40.750
-Legende will fuck your aunts
-Holidays just around the corner

1:20:40.833 --> 1:20:45.541
-Camel jockeys are migrants
-No matter what color

1:21:40.458 --> 1:21:42.125
Two point eight million.

1:21:42.208 --> 1:21:44.458
Yes? Happy?

1:21:47.208 --> 1:21:48.875
There's mold in Ossi's room.

1:21:48.958 --> 1:21:51.333
His grandpa is a criminal,

1:21:51.416 --> 1:21:54.541
his mom hates me,
probably because she's a disaster herself.

1:21:55.166 --> 1:21:57.833
I... I could never...

1:21:57.916 --> 1:22:00.791
never ever be with someone like Ossi.

1:22:04.250 --> 1:22:06.916
-Why do I miss him?
-It's your hormones.

1:22:07.666 --> 1:22:11.375
Or an emotionally triggered
metabolic malfunction of your brain.

1:22:11.916 --> 1:22:14.250
It's also called being in love.
It happens,

1:22:14.333 --> 1:22:15.416
and it also goes away.

1:22:16.750 --> 1:22:18.708
Yeah, you're right.

1:22:18.791 --> 1:22:19.875
Of course I'm right.

1:22:19.958 --> 1:22:21.625
I hope it's gone by tomorrow.

1:22:21.708 --> 1:22:24.750
I need to forget about him quickly.
This is no good.

1:22:29.375 --> 1:22:30.583
Good night.

1:22:32.500 --> 1:22:34.291
Good night, Camilla.

1:22:44.625 --> 1:22:48.291
Fifteen years of experience
Quotes on the walls

1:22:48.375 --> 1:22:51.208
You, you're barely 15
Me, I'm Legende

1:22:51.291 --> 1:22:54.333
Turned gray through jail
Scars on my hands

1:22:54.416 --> 1:22:57.416
I'm fucking all your superheroes
Me, I'm Legende

1:22:57.500 --> 1:23:00.750
Behind me, me, me
The fucking grim reaper is waiting

1:23:00.833 --> 1:23:02.625
But no one can extinguish me

1:23:02.708 --> 1:23:06.083
This is all very well, but it's too noisy.

1:23:15.875 --> 1:23:18.416
Really. This won't do.

1:23:18.500 --> 1:23:21.875
You're my boy. You think
I'll let you enter the ring like this?

1:23:22.666 --> 1:23:25.583
-It's all good.
-It's all shit, Ossi.

1:23:25.666 --> 1:23:28.666
Casanova was no boxer. Do you know why?

1:23:29.500 --> 1:23:31.333
When the heart beats, the fist won't hit.

1:23:32.208 --> 1:23:33.625
Old boxing wisdom.

1:23:33.708 --> 1:23:36.375
Guys, hold onto your girls!

1:23:36.458 --> 1:23:38.916
Here comes the king!

1:23:39.458 --> 1:23:40.291
Hey!

1:23:41.083 --> 1:23:42.416
Oh! Wrong way around.

1:23:42.500 --> 1:23:45.333
Two things do not belong into the ring.
Girls...

1:23:46.083 --> 1:23:49.125
-and Heidelberg.
-Oscar!

1:23:50.875 --> 1:23:53.625
-I'm an Internet star.
-I don't give a fuck.

1:23:53.708 --> 1:23:55.625
Hey, I signed!

1:23:55.708 --> 1:23:56.958
On the Internet, I mean...

1:23:57.041 --> 1:24:00.291
Internet and... label.

1:24:00.375 --> 1:24:04.458
They set up an account for me
with €30,000 in it.

1:24:04.875 --> 1:24:06.250
You know what that means?

1:24:18.083 --> 1:24:19.833
Here. I'm paying for the fight myself.

1:24:21.750 --> 1:24:24.291
My grandpa is sponsoring me.
I don't want your money.

1:24:24.375 --> 1:24:27.333
-Ossi, it's your money.
-I don't want your damn money.

1:24:28.666 --> 1:24:31.458
There's no reason
to shit on me like that, okay?

1:24:31.541 --> 1:24:34.500
-I have always been honest with you.
-Honest with me?

1:24:34.583 --> 1:24:36.250
You were going to fleece me, remember?

1:24:36.333 --> 1:24:39.750
God, yeah, as if that would have hurt you,
a few thousand less.

1:24:39.833 --> 1:24:43.583
So I'm a bad person now
for giving you money to help me?

1:24:43.666 --> 1:24:46.750
But it's completely fine
when you hurt my feel...

1:24:48.750 --> 1:24:51.041
Hurt your feelings? What?

1:24:51.875 --> 1:24:54.250
-I'm laughing. What feelings?
-Yeah, right.

1:24:54.333 --> 1:24:57.125
Rich people like me don't have feelings.

1:24:57.208 --> 1:25:01.125
They're just for poor, trashy Ossis
like you. You had such a hard life.

1:25:01.208 --> 1:25:05.916
You know what? I don't want to talk
to you at all. Glad this shit is over.

1:25:06.416 --> 1:25:07.250
Guess how I feel.

1:25:07.333 --> 1:25:10.791
I had to change my sheets
to get that stench out of my room.

1:25:10.875 --> 1:25:12.208
What?

1:25:12.291 --> 1:25:15.250
Yeah, that's right. You're a bit smelly!

1:25:15.333 --> 1:25:18.708
I had to wash it all at 90 degrees,
along with my sports gear.

1:25:18.791 --> 1:25:22.250
Boy, Ossi! You live in stench!

1:25:22.791 --> 1:25:25.458
Did you never notice
the moldy spot in your room

1:25:25.541 --> 1:25:28.000
that's so disgusting!
Why does no one clean that?

1:25:28.083 --> 1:25:30.250
What's your mom doing all day?

1:25:36.666 --> 1:25:38.416
-Fuck you, Isi!
-Fuck you!

1:25:38.500 --> 1:25:41.583
You know what?
You're pathetic and unhappy,

1:25:41.666 --> 1:25:44.541
and you'll stay like that
your whole fucking life!

1:25:44.625 --> 1:25:48.083
Yeah, right, and you'll be happy
at your gas station job?

1:25:48.166 --> 1:25:51.166
You do realize you will lose the fight
against that Jukovic?

1:25:51.875 --> 1:25:52.708
Vukovic!

1:25:52.791 --> 1:25:56.041
You don't even understand
your own fucking coach!

1:25:56.125 --> 1:25:57.708
Yes, fuck off!

1:26:10.083 --> 1:26:11.500
Were you eavesdropping?

1:26:15.250 --> 1:26:18.208
Honey, what you're going through
with the boy right now is--

1:26:18.916 --> 1:26:20.791
Are you really giving me advice
about men?

1:26:20.875 --> 1:26:22.583
Isi, calm down.

1:26:22.666 --> 1:26:26.458
No. Tell me, how does that work?
How do I find a real man, a real rich one?

1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:28.916
Are there special ads you can run?

1:26:29.750 --> 1:26:31.958
-How did you find Dad?
-Isi!

1:26:32.041 --> 1:26:33.458
Let's assume I'm like you.

1:26:33.541 --> 1:26:35.833
I'm looking for a really rich guy?

1:26:36.541 --> 1:26:39.833
I don't have to change my name, at least.
Was that enough back then?

1:26:39.916 --> 1:26:44.000
To change your name to sound aristocratic
because the rich marry among themselves?

1:26:44.083 --> 1:26:45.833
Okay, Isi, enough.

1:26:47.666 --> 1:26:49.416
Or did you have to get pregnant first?

1:26:55.791 --> 1:26:57.916
You were pregnant at the wedding.

1:27:01.958 --> 1:27:03.875
Was I your System D to get rich?

1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:08.125
No.

1:27:14.083 --> 1:27:18.125
Your life is a fucking lie.

1:27:28.208 --> 1:27:29.041
Jab.

1:27:30.625 --> 1:27:34.291
Two double hooks. One left, two rights.

1:27:35.958 --> 1:27:38.541
Again! Give it to him!

1:27:38.625 --> 1:27:40.291
Again! That's it!

1:27:40.375 --> 1:27:42.583
Give it to him!

1:27:42.666 --> 1:27:43.875
Come on!

1:27:43.958 --> 1:27:48.625
Give it to the fatso! Go on!

1:27:48.708 --> 1:27:49.791
Fuck!

1:27:49.875 --> 1:27:51.166
Cunt!

1:28:36.875 --> 1:28:38.833
This is your grandmother.

1:28:38.916 --> 1:28:41.541
It's the only photo I kept of her.

1:28:45.541 --> 1:28:47.833
It was not a lie that she died young.

1:28:50.541 --> 1:28:52.958
The photo was taken when I was two.

1:28:56.500 --> 1:28:59.500
She locked me in the car
so she could party.

1:29:06.166 --> 1:29:09.458
The police came only
after a few hours and rescued me.

1:29:11.833 --> 1:29:14.000
I kept this photo...

1:29:14.708 --> 1:29:19.291
so it would always remind me
where I came from.

1:29:19.375 --> 1:29:22.875
And why I changed my name.

1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:27.416
We have something in common.

1:29:31.125 --> 1:29:33.833
Neither of us want to be like our mothers.

1:29:45.875 --> 1:29:46.833
I'm sorry.

1:30:05.166 --> 1:30:10.083
CAMILLA
YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN THIS

1:30:16.375 --> 1:30:19.791
-She has a problem with Illuminati.
-I'm no Illuminati.

1:30:19.875 --> 1:30:22.541
All millionaires are Illuminati, bitch.

1:30:23.125 --> 1:30:25.458
No. You're just jealous we're rich
and you're not. Go cry.

1:30:26.208 --> 1:30:30.708
And actually, we're billionaires, bitches.

1:30:40.125 --> 1:30:43.166
DRUNK BILLIONAIRE

1:30:45.333 --> 1:30:46.458
Jerk.

1:31:03.458 --> 1:31:06.958
Ossi. All debts are paid. It's over.

1:31:07.458 --> 1:31:08.625
We're up and running!

1:31:11.291 --> 1:31:13.458
Hello? Can you be happy?

1:31:17.250 --> 1:31:18.125
Yes?

1:31:19.875 --> 1:31:22.250
What? Dumbass...

1:31:24.708 --> 1:31:27.000
What? How... Backed out?

1:31:28.083 --> 1:31:30.125
Not again, man.

1:31:30.208 --> 1:31:31.666
Man, dumbass!

1:31:34.333 --> 1:31:35.666
Fuck, man!

1:31:36.458 --> 1:31:37.583
Fuck!

1:31:38.500 --> 1:31:40.750
Bad.

1:31:40.833 --> 1:31:43.625
LOG IN

1:31:49.500 --> 1:31:51.916
BANCA CORVINO GERMANY
ONLINE BANKING

1:31:59.375 --> 1:32:00.250
Okay.

1:32:01.833 --> 1:32:02.833
Not bad.

1:32:04.125 --> 1:32:06.375
First time I'm eating
in this fucking joint.

1:32:06.958 --> 1:32:07.791
Enjoy your meal.

1:32:18.833 --> 1:32:20.708
Good day, Isi. How are you?

1:32:20.791 --> 1:32:22.708
Wow, Gabriella!

1:32:22.791 --> 1:32:24.125
You look great!

1:32:24.208 --> 1:32:25.958
Thanks. I'm fine, too.

1:32:26.041 --> 1:32:28.583
A cheeseburger, please.
Thank you, chop-chop.

1:32:33.458 --> 1:32:35.333
Wow, you're really rich.

1:32:35.416 --> 1:32:38.875
Yes, I'm very rich,
but I only did it for fun.

1:32:40.541 --> 1:32:41.666
Keep the change.

1:32:42.708 --> 1:32:45.708
I'm going back to Milan,
where I am very rich.

1:32:46.458 --> 1:32:48.375
See you never again.

1:33:04.166 --> 1:33:05.791
Are you fucking with me?

1:33:07.166 --> 1:33:11.208
Fuck you! You gave them money
so they could back out!

1:33:11.291 --> 1:33:13.750
-Are you crazy?
-Police are on the way.

1:33:15.666 --> 1:33:17.166
You uploaded the video, jerk!

1:33:17.250 --> 1:33:20.333
-And you think that's the same?
-Get lost! If the police...

1:33:20.416 --> 1:33:23.166
-I don't give a fuck!
-Don't say your name and go!

1:33:26.458 --> 1:33:28.000
What kind of a person are you?

1:33:30.250 --> 1:33:31.291
Same!

1:33:32.833 --> 1:33:37.791
TSCHÜNNI - BRO, YOUR GRANPA IS OUT
TO GET THAT DUMBASS RAPPER

1:33:40.083 --> 1:33:41.708
-I need your car.
-What?

1:33:41.791 --> 1:33:43.083
My mom has mine, I need yours.

1:33:43.166 --> 1:33:47.250
Grandpa will go to jail otherwise, okay?
Give me your keys or your car. Help me!

1:33:48.083 --> 1:33:49.083
Please!

1:33:53.333 --> 1:33:54.833
Why will he go to jail again?

1:33:54.916 --> 1:33:57.000
Some rapper dissed him on the Internet.

1:33:57.541 --> 1:34:01.166
I told the old fart
not to open his cake hole too wide.

1:34:01.250 --> 1:34:03.333
Then he shut up.

1:34:03.416 --> 1:34:06.958
And I just hit him,
I hit him from the right, from below,

1:34:07.041 --> 1:34:08.625
I wiped the floor with him.

1:34:08.708 --> 1:34:12.208
Hey, asshole!
Embarrassing grandpa, my ass!

1:34:12.291 --> 1:34:15.666
-I'll smash your face in!
-Fuck off, stupid grandpa!

1:34:21.875 --> 1:34:24.791
Hey, let go of him!

1:34:25.791 --> 1:34:29.125
-No! Let go!
-Stop it, man!

1:34:29.208 --> 1:34:31.791
I'm not taking any shit from him! Idiot!

1:34:31.875 --> 1:34:33.458
Fuck them!

1:34:33.958 --> 1:34:36.416
Fuck them all! Idiots!

1:34:41.666 --> 1:34:44.708
I don't even know
what fucking planet I'm on anymore.

1:34:44.791 --> 1:34:47.583
There are hipsters
and assholes everywhere!

1:34:47.666 --> 1:34:51.208
You beat up 20-year-olds
to go back to jail?

1:34:51.291 --> 1:34:53.125
Do you think I don't see what's going on?

1:34:53.208 --> 1:34:56.500
You were scared of being outside.
That's why you were rapping.

1:34:56.583 --> 1:34:59.166
Okay, but you need to stick with it.

1:34:59.250 --> 1:35:01.791
Adapt a bit. That's how it's done.

1:35:01.875 --> 1:35:06.000
Always the same shit with these things.

1:35:06.083 --> 1:35:08.750
You have no clue, man.
That's just how you flip.

1:35:08.833 --> 1:35:11.250
Flipping through the Internet
on your phone.

1:35:11.333 --> 1:35:15.708
And why are they all driving big fat jeeps
in the middle of the city?

1:35:15.791 --> 1:35:18.583
-What's that shit about?
-I know, it makes no sense.

1:35:18.666 --> 1:35:20.958
-Where are they going?
-It's just the way it is.

1:35:21.041 --> 1:35:24.250
And I need to... online... digital...
prisoner release number,

1:35:24.333 --> 1:35:26.333
appointment... shit like that.

1:35:26.416 --> 1:35:28.166
-You have to make an appointment?
-What?

1:35:28.250 --> 1:35:30.750
-Do you have to make an appointment?
-Yes. I don't have an ID card.

1:35:30.833 --> 1:35:32.541
-You have no ID card?
-No.

1:35:32.625 --> 1:35:34.541
That's shit, too.

1:35:35.875 --> 1:35:38.958
Okay, I'll help you.

1:35:39.041 --> 1:35:40.375
We'll get you an ID card.

1:35:41.458 --> 1:35:43.000
-Okay.
-Okay?

1:35:43.541 --> 1:35:47.166
-But you stay calm now.
-Sure, I'll be calm.

1:35:48.375 --> 1:35:50.708
Smartass. Grandson.

1:35:51.541 --> 1:35:53.125
Yeah, me, too. Fuck.

1:35:56.208 --> 1:35:57.500
Smartass.

1:36:10.166 --> 1:36:11.541
Sorry about the video.

1:36:16.125 --> 1:36:17.958
I didn't want to admit...

1:36:20.666 --> 1:36:24.833
that someone like me
could fall for someone like you.

1:36:35.166 --> 1:36:36.750
You don't stink, okay?

1:36:39.583 --> 1:36:42.083
I just wanted... that it...

1:36:44.541 --> 1:36:45.708
You smell nice.

1:36:49.250 --> 1:36:50.333
Too nice.

1:36:54.916 --> 1:36:57.666
I never felt bad about my family before.

1:36:59.583 --> 1:37:01.666
Or that we only get the cheap stuff.

1:37:04.208 --> 1:37:06.750
I never noticed the mold in my room.

1:37:07.666 --> 1:37:10.791
That I'm called Ossi and I have no clue
about eating etiquette.

1:37:12.083 --> 1:37:13.875
I never gave a fuck about any of that.

1:37:14.958 --> 1:37:16.375
And then you came along,

1:37:17.333 --> 1:37:19.333
and, all of a sudden, I feel like trash.

1:37:29.458 --> 1:37:33.541
I would always feel like trash
next to you.

1:38:25.291 --> 1:38:27.375
I'll call Yannis' manager.

1:38:29.291 --> 1:38:30.583
I'll set things straight.

1:38:34.208 --> 1:38:36.083
I'll take down the video.

1:38:47.916 --> 1:38:50.791
Dumbass, the fight will take place.

1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:53.291
That's final.

1:38:53.750 --> 1:38:55.375
And I'll win. Got that?

1:39:05.125 --> 1:39:07.250
DESSERT FOR RICH KIDS
#COKE #PUKE

1:39:11.375 --> 1:39:13.708
My dad's dick is even smaller
than I thought.

1:39:13.791 --> 1:39:18.000
It wasn't enough to buy me a Tesla,
so now I have a Jaguar I-Pace.

1:39:18.083 --> 1:39:22.250
God, not that again. Of course we deliver
into war zones. Where else?

1:39:22.875 --> 1:39:25.833
Are they supposed
to shoot each other in the streets?

1:39:25.916 --> 1:39:28.666
There are not enough
countries in the world.

1:39:28.750 --> 1:39:32.875
It's about time Mars will be colonized,
so I can finally go on holidays again.

1:39:32.958 --> 1:39:36.125
Yeah, I discussed it with my dad
and he is thrilled.

1:39:36.208 --> 1:39:40.791
It means I can start out in his company
and achieve something while studying.

1:39:40.875 --> 1:39:41.958
But can you?

1:39:42.875 --> 1:39:45.208
I mean, achieve something?

1:39:46.625 --> 1:39:52.375
Regardless of what you will achieve,
you'll owe it to your grandfather's money.

1:39:53.333 --> 1:39:56.375
Will it ever feel like true success?

1:39:59.583 --> 1:40:01.166
Yes, thanks.

1:40:02.416 --> 1:40:05.916
Anyway, it's the chance of a lifetime.

1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:09.208
I just need to pick
the perfect time for it.

1:40:09.291 --> 1:40:10.666
Come over if you want.

1:40:16.791 --> 1:40:18.791
I only had one hour of training.

1:40:19.791 --> 1:40:22.625
-What's so important?
-Ossi...

1:40:23.833 --> 1:40:27.416
That Isi, right?
You'll have to go for it again.

1:40:28.166 --> 1:40:31.166
The electric pump, there is some...

1:40:31.250 --> 1:40:35.958
insurance thing, total rubbish,
but we'll manage. We're missing 2,000.

1:40:36.041 --> 1:40:41.000
And for repairs, right? We need to invest
some more. 4,000 will be more than enough.

1:40:42.416 --> 1:40:45.041
But it's not a problem,
just go for it again.

1:40:49.583 --> 1:40:51.500
I'm not throwing more money
out the window.

1:40:52.291 --> 1:40:53.125
What?

1:40:57.291 --> 1:41:00.250
I want to box, Mom. Properly.

1:41:02.916 --> 1:41:05.583
I need to go to Frankfurt.
I need proper management.

1:41:06.250 --> 1:41:09.000
What's going on? What's this rubbish?

1:41:09.750 --> 1:41:10.958
It's not rubbish.

1:41:13.500 --> 1:41:16.583
-I'm not part of this anymore.
-Calm down, buddy.

1:41:17.666 --> 1:41:19.250
Please, Mom, okay?

1:41:20.541 --> 1:41:22.875
-Close this place down.
-What?

1:41:23.500 --> 1:41:26.750
-Find a job, okay?
-What? I mean...

1:41:26.833 --> 1:41:29.166
-What's this rubbish...
-Look for a job!

1:41:29.916 --> 1:41:33.958
Ossi! Stay here! Ossi!

1:41:35.166 --> 1:41:39.291
Ossi! Wait! Stay! I don't get a job!

1:41:40.625 --> 1:41:42.416
I never learned anything!

1:41:48.083 --> 1:41:50.625
Camilla, you're the most
intelligent person I know.

1:41:50.708 --> 1:41:52.916
-Poor you.
-I have more than two million

1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:55.083
-and I feel shitty.
-Maybe you have a cold.

1:41:55.833 --> 1:41:57.750
Camilla. Seriously, I didn't earn this.

1:41:58.416 --> 1:42:00.791
I didn't do anything.
Why does this money belong to me?

1:42:00.875 --> 1:42:04.750
-What did you want the money for?
-For the cooking course in New York.

1:42:05.625 --> 1:42:07.250
So why aren't you in New York?

1:42:10.291 --> 1:42:12.041
Do you know why money makes me happy?

1:42:12.708 --> 1:42:14.166
Because I have a Camilla heart.

1:42:15.500 --> 1:42:17.875
It always jumps with joy
when it gets money.

1:42:19.500 --> 1:42:20.666
You, however...

1:42:22.083 --> 1:42:25.708
You have a weird Isi heart. It gets no joy
from money, it doesn't like money.

1:42:27.375 --> 1:42:29.208
It rejoices in different things.

1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:33.958
What I just said was really beautiful.

1:42:37.750 --> 1:42:40.000
"ONLY FRIENDSHIP IS
MORE IMPORTANT THAN MONEY" - ME.

1:42:51.291 --> 1:42:53.958
15 years and my butt is still tender

1:42:54.041 --> 1:42:57.041
I am happy to be here
For the very first time

1:42:57.666 --> 1:43:01.083
Till yesterday I had other hobbies
I've made millions with rapping

1:43:01.166 --> 1:43:04.333
Everything else is secondary

1:43:04.416 --> 1:43:08.208
This is a physical battle
I can do it, I can do it

1:43:08.291 --> 1:43:10.041
Take a look on YouTube

1:43:18.125 --> 1:43:20.708
-Did you see my mom?
-Relax.

1:43:22.750 --> 1:43:23.833
She will be here.

1:43:24.958 --> 1:43:27.458
-Concentrate on the fight.
-My words exactly.

1:43:28.791 --> 1:43:30.083
She's not answering her phone.

1:43:30.958 --> 1:43:33.458
Dumbass, you need to find her.
I'm really worried.

1:43:34.416 --> 1:43:35.416
Hey!

1:43:53.583 --> 1:43:55.000
I'll find a job.

1:44:01.083 --> 1:44:02.000
I'm sorry.

1:44:06.375 --> 1:44:07.708
I'm sorry, too.

1:44:09.750 --> 1:44:11.041
Shut up.

1:44:17.875 --> 1:44:18.875
TAKE YOUR ABITUR

1:44:28.833 --> 1:44:31.125
Go back home, Santa!

1:44:32.083 --> 1:44:35.291
Look him in the eye. Do not show any fear.

1:44:37.291 --> 1:44:39.000
Does he have Abitur or what?

1:44:40.458 --> 1:44:42.958
-Hi, how are you? All good?
-Hello.

1:44:45.625 --> 1:44:46.791
He's very nice, man.

1:45:04.916 --> 1:45:06.208
Yes!

1:45:06.750 --> 1:45:10.708
-Keep going!
-That's it!

1:45:11.125 --> 1:45:11.958
Fight back!

1:45:25.166 --> 1:45:27.416
Stay awake!

1:45:29.166 --> 1:45:30.875
Ossi, block him!

1:45:32.375 --> 1:45:34.500
Defend yourself, man!

1:45:34.583 --> 1:45:36.333
Show him!

1:45:48.958 --> 1:45:51.500
You need to surprise him.

1:45:51.583 --> 1:45:53.291
That asshole can read minds.

1:45:53.375 --> 1:45:55.791
Ossi! Listen, you need to startle him.

1:45:58.833 --> 1:45:59.833
Be quiet.

1:46:01.166 --> 1:46:02.541
Be quiet now!

1:46:03.875 --> 1:46:06.625
He always knows what I'll do.
He can read my mind.

1:46:07.708 --> 1:46:09.125
The dumbass has Abitur.

1:46:10.541 --> 1:46:14.083
EMERGENCY EXIT

1:46:27.833 --> 1:46:28.708
He'll kill him.

1:46:29.291 --> 1:46:33.291
He needs to throw in the towel!
It's not happening. I can't watch!

1:46:55.875 --> 1:46:57.541
I bought the burger joint.

1:46:58.875 --> 1:47:01.458
I know it's completely crazy,

1:47:01.541 --> 1:47:05.125
but I've never felt as alive
as I do with you.

1:47:05.208 --> 1:47:06.666
Everything was crazy!

1:47:06.750 --> 1:47:10.041
-What's she doing there?
-It's fine. He needs that.

1:47:10.125 --> 1:47:12.333
-It's all good.
-I don't want to go to New York.

1:47:12.416 --> 1:47:15.083
And I won't be talked out
of being in love with you.

1:47:16.333 --> 1:47:19.500
I want to want what I want
and not what I think I want.

1:47:20.625 --> 1:47:21.666
I want you.

1:47:22.666 --> 1:47:24.333
And you're not trash.

1:47:25.166 --> 1:47:26.000
You're perfect.

1:47:28.166 --> 1:47:30.958
-Are you okay?
-Great.

1:47:32.416 --> 1:47:36.166
And the most important thing
I want to tell you is--

1:47:59.541 --> 1:48:01.083
Hey, Ossi!

1:48:05.083 --> 1:48:07.208
Ossi, hey!

1:48:07.291 --> 1:48:08.416
Ossi!

1:48:13.833 --> 1:48:15.583
I'll never take you to the opera.

1:48:17.291 --> 1:48:20.958
-Opera is the worst that there is.
-Okay.

1:48:22.041 --> 1:48:24.375
And I will have your room remodeled.

1:48:24.458 --> 1:48:26.666
Can I still be called Ossi?

1:48:26.750 --> 1:48:28.458
If you don't laugh at me
for having pedicures.

1:48:28.541 --> 1:48:30.791
One step towards me. Okay.

1:48:30.875 --> 1:48:32.625
I don't even know what that is.

1:48:34.583 --> 1:48:36.166
So, you want to win now or...

1:48:36.250 --> 1:48:37.250
And box!

1:48:38.416 --> 1:48:39.583
Come on!

1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:19.750
I'm happy! Lanky!

1:49:19.833 --> 1:49:21.666
I'm so happy!

1:49:41.750 --> 1:49:44.666
There. They got together after all.

1:49:45.250 --> 1:49:47.833
But of course,
some questions remain unanswered.

1:49:47.916 --> 1:49:50.000
Will Grandpa really make it as a rapper?

1:49:50.541 --> 1:49:51.791
Will Betty find a job?

1:49:51.875 --> 1:49:54.625
Does Camilla want a trashy guy, too,
and snatch Tschünni?

1:49:54.708 --> 1:49:58.750
And of course,
how will things go for Isi and Ossi?

1:49:58.833 --> 1:50:02.375
But for the first time in Isi's life,
no one knows what's coming.

1:50:02.458 --> 1:50:05.916
And that's okay,
because that's how life fucking is!

1:52:36.250 --> 1:52:38.416
