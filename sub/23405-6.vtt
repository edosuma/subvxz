00:19.060 --> 00:20.687
( camera shutter clicking )

00:24.649 --> 00:26.484
Nope. No.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.155
You cannot
be here, Alan.

00:30.238 --> 00:31.322
Is that her?

00:31.406 --> 00:33.116
Alan, what are you
doing here?

00:33.199 --> 00:36.578
Tom Davis, he runs--
represents the owners
of the property.

00:36.661 --> 00:39.873
I'm aware of who he is,
but right now, this property
is under my jurisdiction.

00:39.956 --> 00:42.417
- We're not going
to get in anybody's way--
- You already are in the way.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.585
Don't you talk to me
that way!

00:43.668 --> 00:45.378
I'm not doing this now.
Dave?

00:45.462 --> 00:47.172
- Tom: Alan, it's all right.
- It's time to go, Mr. Pape.

00:47.255 --> 00:48.798
- Get your hands off me.
- Mr. Pape, it's time to go.

00:48.882 --> 00:52.177
- Tom: Alan...
- Oh, good. No. Nope.

00:52.260 --> 00:53.511
Trust me,

00:53.595 --> 00:55.638
you guys do not want
to be the technicality

00:55.722 --> 00:57.474
that gets this case
shut down again.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.476
Joel:
"Down again"?
You mean it's open?

00:59.559 --> 01:01.644
Nate: Unofficially.
I'm trying to get it
reopened.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.146
And in light
of the new circumstances,

01:03.229 --> 01:04.647
I think I got
a pretty good shot.

01:04.731 --> 01:05.982
Well, that's--
that's great.

01:06.065 --> 01:07.400
Nate:
Yeah, as long
as nobody screws it up

01:07.484 --> 01:09.861
and I get to do the job
the way I need to do it.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.446
Is that why
Alan was so angry?

01:11.529 --> 01:12.906
It's complicated.

01:12.989 --> 01:14.991
Alan is mad because
he's not boss anymore

01:15.074 --> 01:17.577
and because he's trying
to get information that
I can't give him

01:17.660 --> 01:19.204
- or to anyone!
- Anyone?

01:19.287 --> 01:21.164
Nate:
Yeah, anyone,
meaning specifically

01:21.247 --> 01:23.291
people who are not
involved in this case.

01:23.374 --> 01:25.251
I need you guys
off the property now.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.128
- Reporter:<i> Detective,</i>
<i>a statement, please.</i>
- Joel, please.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.255
Hey! Especially you.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.257
Look, I'm sorry,
but things are
different now.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.343
I-- I can't
communicate with you.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.262
- Are you serious?
- I need you off
the property now.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.264
Reporter:
Is it Olivia Lake?

01:38.348 --> 01:40.099
Would you secure this,
please?

01:40.183 --> 01:41.726
Reporter:
Can you please give us
some more information?

01:41.810 --> 01:43.520
Nate:
No comment.
Come on, Dave, John.

01:43.603 --> 01:47.065
No comment!
Please, no comment.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.984
Um... excuse me, Petra.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.694
I...

01:51.778 --> 01:54.823
think I need to take
a walk or something.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.991
Oh, sure, sure.
Of course.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.827
I gotta--

01:58.910 --> 02:00.787
I gotta think about
some stuff, too.

Olivia's voice:
<i>Oh, JC, when you</i>
<i>call in for this,</i>

02:45.540 --> 02:49.127
<i>I hope it costs you,</i>
<i>like, eight million pesos</i>

02:49.210 --> 02:53.464

<i>the currency is in Ibiza.</i>

<i>Oh, shit.</i>

<i>( chuckles )</i>

02:58.720 --> 03:02.098

<i>including</i>
<i>and specifically you</i>

03:12.400 --> 03:14.068
<i>in this moment.</i>

<i>I cannot believe</i>

<i>that I let you go away</i>

03:19.449 --> 03:23.036

03:23.119 --> 03:26.247

04:14.921 --> 04:20.218
<i>he just fucking had</i>
<i>his fist, like, right up</i>

04:20.301 --> 04:24.180
<i>and was just screaming</i>
<i>and spitting</i>

04:24.263 --> 04:27.892

<i>Look who's back.</i>

04:30.520 --> 04:31.729
( sighs )

04:31.813 --> 04:34.190
Olivia's voice:
<i>Ugh, fuck.</i>

04:38.236 --> 04:40.947
JC:
<i>First Christmas</i>
<i>she allowed me to leave</i>

04:41.030 --> 04:44.075
because of
where things were
with your brother.

04:44.158 --> 04:46.244
-<i> ( dogs barking )</i>
- Where she thought they were.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.839
I always told her
there were three things
I hated about her--

04:57.922 --> 04:59.757
her yapping mutts,

04:59.841 --> 05:01.384
her horrid cats,

05:01.467 --> 05:05.596
and her god-awful
faux Rococo credenza.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.683
So when she
rewrites her will...

05:10.226 --> 05:11.352
what does
she leave me?

05:13.563 --> 05:15.314
My fault, though.

05:15.398 --> 05:16.983
I told her
there was no way

05:17.066 --> 05:21.529
I wasn't giving her
my velvet Elvis collection.

05:23.573 --> 05:26.200
I don't know
what smells worse--

05:26.284 --> 05:29.495
the endless amount
of food that goes in

05:29.579 --> 05:34.375
or the endless
stream of shit
that comes out.

05:34.459 --> 05:37.670
And somewhere in the middle,
they apparently give pleasure.

05:38.921 --> 05:40.381
<i>( kissing noises )</i>

05:42.008 --> 05:44.093
Who do you think
she was talking about

05:44.177 --> 05:46.346
at the end
of the recording?

05:46.429 --> 05:49.432
Uh, do you mean
besides your brother?

05:49.515 --> 05:51.017
You really think
it was him?

05:52.518 --> 05:54.270
I'd like to think
it wasn't.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.940
I'd like to think
that even for a moment

05:58.024 --> 06:00.026
she'd found
something real.

06:00.109 --> 06:01.903
Who else
could it be? Joel?

06:04.655 --> 06:07.408
She talks about
trouble with men.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.577
Joel was "the boy."

06:09.660 --> 06:11.245
Sometimes just "boy."

06:14.123 --> 06:16.084
<i>Poor kid.</i>

06:16.167 --> 06:18.795
<i>Big dreams</i>
<i>and bad luck.</i>

06:18.878 --> 06:21.672
<i>But a good kid</i>
<i>at his core.</i>

06:21.756 --> 06:25.968
<i>I always thought, for him,</i>
<i>that was the most</i>
<i>important thing.</i>

06:26.052 --> 06:27.387
To be a good guy?

06:28.930 --> 06:30.556
<i>Did they have</i>
<i>a relationship?</i>

06:30.640 --> 06:32.975
She fancied him
for maybe five minutes,

06:33.059 --> 06:34.435
I think literally.

06:36.687 --> 06:37.939
<i>What about Michael?</i>

06:39.857 --> 06:41.275
O'Connor?

06:41.359 --> 06:45.696
Hold on,
I'll pour myself
a glass of water

06:45.780 --> 06:48.699
and gladly perform
a spit take for you.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.952
They never...?

06:51.035 --> 06:51.994
<i>Dated?</i>

06:52.078 --> 06:54.539
Uh, no.

06:54.622 --> 06:55.873
Trust me.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.752
<i>How about Alan Pape?</i>

07:06.592 --> 07:07.468
It's funny.

07:09.428 --> 07:12.974
If John Stamos was
"We have reached our
cruising altitude,"

07:13.057 --> 07:17.186
Alan Pape was
"We have now begun
our initial descent."

07:17.270 --> 07:19.063
They went out?

07:19.147 --> 07:20.648
<i>Briefly.</i>

07:20.731 --> 07:22.024
Was it big?

07:22.108 --> 07:23.526
For him.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.070
<i>How big?</i>

07:26.154 --> 07:28.072
"He used to be
married" big.

07:29.323 --> 07:30.741
<i>And for her?</i>

07:30.825 --> 07:32.160
Like Altoids.

07:32.243 --> 07:34.203
<i>Or those little things</i>
<i>you pick up</i>

07:34.287 --> 07:35.830
<i>on your way</i>
<i>out of Walgreens</i>

07:35.913 --> 07:39.250
<i>like lip balm</i>
<i>or little face fans.</i>

07:39.333 --> 07:41.627
- An afterthought.
-<i> More like the thought you have</i>

07:41.711 --> 07:44.881
<i>that precedes</i>
<i>a full-body shudder.</i>

07:44.964 --> 07:47.550
<i>I think he was</i>
<i>the last person she dated</i>

07:47.633 --> 07:49.719
<i>who was older</i>
<i>than her.</i>

07:49.802 --> 07:51.429
Was he the jealous type?

08:19.540 --> 08:21.834
Oh, wow.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.132
Joel.
Hey, it's Petra.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.884
Just checking in.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.427
Uh, finding out
some stuff,

08:31.510 --> 08:34.430
and some thinking
about you.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.265
Um, might be good
for us to talk.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.475
Give me a call.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.064
JC knows I'm here.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.150
I just have
a few questions.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.986
Hopefully,
I have answers.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.656
<i>Where were you</i>
<i>on the New Year's Eve</i>
<i>that Olivia was killed?</i>

08:52.990 --> 08:54.283
Why is this important?

08:54.367 --> 08:57.245
Just trying to fit
the puzzle pieces together.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.580
<i>I was home alone.</i>

08:59.664 --> 09:00.831
Anyone see you?

09:02.166 --> 09:04.877
As I said, I was alone.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.756
You were in love
with Olivia, weren't you?

09:10.716 --> 09:13.302
How is this
going for you so far?

09:13.386 --> 09:15.513
- I'm sorry?
-<i> My body language.</i>

09:15.596 --> 09:19.016
Am I opening
or am I closing off to you?

09:19.100 --> 09:20.851
I'm sorry, I--
I don't follow.

09:20.935 --> 09:24.313
Even Nancy Drew
knew to bury the lead.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.108
At least act confused,
get me to start
offering things.

09:27.191 --> 09:30.611
<i>I knew where this was going</i>
<i>the minute you walked</i>
<i>through the door.</i>

09:30.695 --> 09:32.947
And to be honest,
even the prurient,

09:33.030 --> 09:34.740
minor thrill I thought
I was gonna get

09:34.824 --> 09:37.201
<i>watching this slow-motion</i>
<i>train wreck has worn off,</i>

09:37.285 --> 09:40.871
<i>and so now</i>
<i>this conversation is over.</i>

09:45.710 --> 09:47.253
They're copies.

09:47.336 --> 09:49.046
They were in the credenza
at Olivia's house.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.965
Those letters are
none of your business.

09:51.048 --> 09:52.133
You were jealous,
you were angry,

09:52.216 --> 09:54.135
you even blame her
for the fact that

09:54.218 --> 09:56.095
-<i> your daughter</i>
<i>won't even speak to you.</i>
- You need to leave now.

09:56.178 --> 09:57.596
Where did you find
Casey Delacroix?

09:57.680 --> 09:59.265
I said you need
to leave.

09:59.348 --> 10:01.309
You dragged
Casey Delacroix
out of hiding

10:01.392 --> 10:04.478
- to reshine the light
back on my brother.
- I'll call the police

10:04.562 --> 10:06.022
or I'll remove you
myself!

10:06.105 --> 10:08.983
Why is it so important to you
to keep my brother behind bars?

10:09.066 --> 10:11.652
Because your brother
is guilty of murder.

10:11.736 --> 10:14.447
<i>And, yes,</i>
<i>those letters are mine.</i>

10:14.530 --> 10:18.617
Now, I, too, lead
what I guess one
would now call

10:18.701 --> 10:20.161
a solitary existence.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.662
And I understand you
to be trying

10:21.746 --> 10:23.581
to make sense of what
little family you have,

10:23.664 --> 10:25.791
and I'm sorry
I don't have a magic pill

10:25.875 --> 10:30.129
to make what I imagine
is a very painful past
go away,

10:30.212 --> 10:32.548
but I had no idea
who Casey Delacroix was

10:32.631 --> 10:34.175
until I saw it
on the news.

10:34.258 --> 10:36.093
And you are in
my place of work

10:36.177 --> 10:37.636
<i>and I'd like it back</i>
<i>now, please,</i>

10:37.720 --> 10:41.432
as I, too, am having
a seriously piss-poor day.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.161
( exhales )

11:10.503 --> 11:13.089
( breathing heavily )

11:21.889 --> 11:23.391
I-- I just
forgot something.

11:25.434 --> 11:28.229
Oh, please don't tell me
you're actually feeling
sorry for me,

11:28.312 --> 11:31.690
'cause to be honest,
I prefer your suspicion
to your pity.

11:33.317 --> 11:35.403
I wanna speak
with Michael O'Connor.

11:37.988 --> 11:39.115
Why?

11:40.658 --> 11:41.909
I-- I don't know
exactly.

11:41.992 --> 11:44.578
I-- but my brother
met with someone

11:44.662 --> 11:46.163
from his organization
a long time ago,

11:46.247 --> 11:48.249
and then a year later,
someone named Cliff Jones

11:48.332 --> 11:53.087
contacted Eric about trying
to wrangle Olivia's land
away from her.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.840
And you think Michael has
something to do with this?

11:55.923 --> 11:59.218
I think Michael may have
a few pieces of the puzzle

11:59.301 --> 12:01.137
that I am
clearly missing.

12:01.220 --> 12:04.306
And why on earth
would I help you?

12:04.390 --> 12:07.518
After what I just
accused you of,
you wouldn't.

12:07.601 --> 12:09.228
And I wouldn't
blame you.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.816
I overreached.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.109
And I'm...

12:17.361 --> 12:19.155
I know I'm in
over my head.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.409
But I have
nowhere else to turn.

12:25.619 --> 12:29.498
You are literally
the only human being
on the planet who can help me.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.174
You don't want
Michael O'Connor.

12:38.257 --> 12:41.010
- I do.
- Michael knows nothing
about anything,

12:41.093 --> 12:43.554
including
where he keeps
his own socks.

12:43.637 --> 12:47.475
If you want information,
you want Tom Davis.

12:47.558 --> 12:50.186
Tom runs his life.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.896
Well, how do
I speak to him?

12:55.232 --> 12:57.526
Wait for me
at the side entrance.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.528
Let me make
a phone call.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.659
Word of advice--

13:05.743 --> 13:07.786
Tom Davis
is a smart man.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.830
Just 'cause
you end a sentence
with a question mark

13:09.914 --> 13:12.666
- don't mean
it's a question.
- I don't follow.

13:12.750 --> 13:16.462
Make sure your
questions are questions
and not accusations.

13:16.545 --> 13:17.713
Noted.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.057
As I mentioned
on the phone,

13:28.140 --> 13:30.559
- Miss-- it is Miss?
- Yes.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.229
Neill has a few
simple questions.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.898
I told her that
you knew everything
about anything

13:35.981 --> 13:39.151
that happens
west of the Mississippi.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.654
And, well,
east of the Pacific.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.157
Please have a seat.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.450
Thank you.

13:52.164 --> 13:55.543
So, I checked
our records.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.545
Your brother
and Mr. Delacroix

13:57.628 --> 14:01.966
approached us
on 6 November, 2011,
at 3:11 p.m.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.134
through our office
in Redding.

14:04.218 --> 14:07.429
They wanted us to fund
some exploratory research

14:07.513 --> 14:10.266
into some of
the decommissioned
old mines on our property.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.435
They were asking people
all around the area.

14:13.519 --> 14:18.023
He was rebuked
on 6 November at 6:14 p.m.

14:18.107 --> 14:21.277
<i>by a phone call</i>
<i>from our office in Summit.</i>

14:21.360 --> 14:24.071
Rebuked?
How so?

14:24.154 --> 14:28.742
<i>I believe</i>
<i>the person he spoke with</i>
<i>explained our position,</i>

14:28.826 --> 14:31.161
<i>and I believe</i>
<i>he got the message.</i>

14:31.245 --> 14:32.788
Which was?

14:32.871 --> 14:35.332
We will not
tolerate grift.

14:37.167 --> 14:38.919
Why didn't you
have him arrested?

14:42.089 --> 14:43.966
I can't say.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.593
Meaning...?

14:47.303 --> 14:48.387
I don't recall.

14:48.470 --> 14:51.390
I'll be honest,
we get this a lot.

14:51.473 --> 14:54.018
We have people
that deal with it.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.770
Was it, by any chance,
a man named Cliff Jones?

14:56.854 --> 14:59.148
I don't know
who that is.

15:01.650 --> 15:04.028
- If that's all--
- I do have one more question.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.780
If the mines were all
old and decommissioned,

15:06.864 --> 15:08.741
why were there geologists
on the property?

15:09.950 --> 15:11.452
Technology
has changed.

15:13.037 --> 15:17.291
Decisions made to do
some minor exploration,

15:17.374 --> 15:19.084
see if things were
more cost-effective.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.753
Happens all the time.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.713
<i>They weren't,</i>
<i>by the way.</i>

15:25.132 --> 15:27.551
<i>Anything further</i>
<i>or are we done here?</i>

15:27.635 --> 15:30.971
Actually, this one
is the art geek in me

15:31.055 --> 15:33.599
who couldn't
live with herself
if she didn't ask.

15:33.682 --> 15:35.768
The Red Room.

15:35.851 --> 15:37.519
<i>You must get this</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

15:40.856 --> 15:41.982
Care to join us?

15:42.066 --> 15:43.984
Thanks,
I'm good.

16:22.564 --> 16:23.899
<i>( door closes )</i>

16:34.952 --> 16:36.620
( exhales )

16:58.851 --> 17:00.477
<i>You know,</i>
<i>you won't win this.</i>

17:02.020 --> 17:03.480
- Win what?
- All this.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.733
These mountains,
these woods

17:05.816 --> 17:08.777
are older, taller,
deeper, more valuable

17:08.861 --> 17:12.156
than you or I
will ever have
or dream of having.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.949
Your brother
found that out.

17:15.659 --> 17:17.745
<i>Don't be a chip</i>
<i>off the same block.</i>

17:25.043 --> 17:27.796
Amy. Hi.
I'm Eric Neill's sister.

17:27.880 --> 17:31.049
Yeah. Yeah, I told you
when you called, though,
it's over.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.260
- I have nothing to add.
- Just-- just a couple
things, please.

17:33.343 --> 17:36.138
I'm, uh-- I'm actually
really confused and I could
really use your guidance.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.098
- My guidance?
- Your-- your expertise.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.642
I'm, uh--
I'm not good at this,
admittedly, not like you,

17:40.726 --> 17:42.770
and I know
I'm grasping at straws

17:42.853 --> 17:45.397
and I just-- really,
please, one question.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.442
All right,
one question.

17:48.525 --> 17:50.444
And cut
the bullshit flattery.

17:50.527 --> 17:52.279
Fair enough.
Thank you.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.114
My brother said
that four years ago,

17:54.198 --> 17:56.992
he mentioned to you
someone named Cliff Jones.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.244
Yes, who I tried
to question but couldn't.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.039
- Because...?
- Because he doesn't exist.

18:02.122 --> 18:03.624
Okay, sure, fine,

18:03.707 --> 18:05.042
but someone
contacted Eric,

18:05.125 --> 18:06.919
someone who said
they're Cliff Jones.

18:07.002 --> 18:08.337
- That, I believe.
- Good.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.172
I'm sure Eric wants you
to believe that.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.424
Okay, here's the thing--
Eric met with Michael O'Connor

18:12.508 --> 18:14.510
or someone
from his group,

18:14.593 --> 18:15.969
and after that,
like a year later,

18:16.053 --> 18:17.971
he gets a call from someone
who may not be Cliff Jones,

18:18.055 --> 18:19.848
- but he calls himself
Cliff Jones...
- I'm sorry...

18:19.932 --> 18:21.809
...and he wants Eric
to pull the exact same scam

18:21.892 --> 18:23.602
that Eric tried to pull
on Michael O'Connor.

18:23.685 --> 18:24.812
Where is this going?

18:26.230 --> 18:27.856
Do you think this is
a coincidence?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.149
Eric meets with
Michael O'Connor

18:29.233 --> 18:30.734
- and then he gets a--
- I'm sorry.

18:30.818 --> 18:33.570
Are you saying
that you think
that Michael O'Connor

18:33.654 --> 18:36.532
has the time or the need
to employ in any capacity

18:36.615 --> 18:38.826
someone like
your brother Eric?

18:38.909 --> 18:40.452
Are you afraid
if this case gets reopened,

18:40.536 --> 18:42.788
you'll look bad
for pushing Eric
into a plea bargain?

18:46.291 --> 18:49.253
You and I are no longer
speaking, all right?

18:49.336 --> 18:52.714
About this
or any other matter.

18:52.798 --> 18:56.885
You know, you have
no idea how far in
over your head you are.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.428
It's fucking sad.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.434
<i>( keyboard clicking )</i>

19:15.195 --> 19:18.031
Hi, it's Petra Neill again
for Dr. Schoendienst.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.200
Just a quick question
about beryllium.

19:20.284 --> 19:22.202
Left my number
on the previous message.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.121
Would appreciate
a quick callback.
Thanks.

19:24.204 --> 19:25.372
Bye.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.587
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

19:42.514 --> 19:44.933
Miss Neill?
I'm sorry to bother you.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.603
My name is Maria Villella.
I'm with "CU News Center."

19:47.686 --> 19:49.771
It's an online paper
for Colorado University.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.565
Now, I'm sure
you're being hounded.

19:51.648 --> 19:53.567
It's not a good time, actually.
I was just leaving.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.193
Well, we're running
a story on Friday

19:55.277 --> 19:56.695
and I'd like to invite you
to be part of it.

19:56.778 --> 19:58.447
It's how the charges
were brought 12 years ago

19:58.530 --> 20:00.282
against your brother
in the death of Eloise Brand.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.492
I believe
there never were
actual charges.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.077
Well, that's actually
what the story's about.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.204
We've received information
that charges were brought

20:06.288 --> 20:09.458
and then dropped in exchange
for information leading to
your father's arrest.

20:11.209 --> 20:13.337
- ( elevator dinging )
- I'm sorry, I have no comment.

20:36.193 --> 20:39.696
Eric:
<i>Whoa, you seem</i>
<i>different.</i>

20:39.780 --> 20:42.115
<i>What's wrong?</i>

20:42.199 --> 20:43.283
Nothing.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.285
Just tired.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.745
( sighs )

20:46.828 --> 20:48.997
So, tell me something
about Cliff Jones.

20:49.081 --> 20:49.957
Anything.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.961
Well, there was
a scar.

20:54.044 --> 20:55.337
<i>Where?</i>

20:55.420 --> 20:58.340
Uh, on his, uh--
his right cheek.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.634
And he didn't drive.

21:00.717 --> 21:04.513
<i>We were waiting at the valet</i>
<i>and he called a cab.</i>

21:04.596 --> 21:06.556
<i>And I said,</i>
<i>"What, you don't drive?"</i>

21:06.640 --> 21:09.434
<i>And he said,</i>
<i>"Long story."</i>

21:09.518 --> 21:11.979
<i>W-What's going on,</i>
<i>Petra?</i>

21:12.062 --> 21:13.981
<i>Are you</i>
<i>still with me?</i>

21:14.064 --> 21:16.024
When did you see him?

21:16.108 --> 21:18.527
-<i> Uh, spring.</i>
- When?

21:18.610 --> 21:19.778
I don't know.

21:19.861 --> 21:21.780
There was
a basketball game on.

21:21.863 --> 21:22.948
It was a big game.

21:23.031 --> 21:25.575
We were in a bar
and the bar was full.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.035
What year?

21:27.119 --> 21:28.704
<i>It was before</i>
<i>I met Olivia.</i>

21:28.787 --> 21:30.747
<i>It was the Final Four.</i>

21:30.831 --> 21:34.292
He said something
about not getting
to the finals again.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.586
He was pissed
'cause one of the teams--

21:36.670 --> 21:38.880
- Which team?
-<i> I don't know.</i>

21:38.964 --> 21:41.008
Which team?

21:41.091 --> 21:42.801
<i>Whichever one</i>
<i>played UConn.</i>

21:42.884 --> 21:45.554
- He was pissed
at UConn.
-<i> Why?</i>

21:45.637 --> 21:47.681
Because they beat
his team.

21:47.764 --> 21:50.600
Yes!
We're getting somewhere.
Ask me another.

21:50.684 --> 21:54.479
Did you throw
Dad under the bus
to save your own skin?

21:56.440 --> 21:57.649
What?

21:57.733 --> 21:59.860
God, no.
Wow, no.

21:59.943 --> 22:01.111
- Why?
- Eric.

22:02.779 --> 22:04.031
No.

22:04.114 --> 22:05.365
Not like it sounds.

22:06.783 --> 22:07.951
Don't do your face.

22:08.035 --> 22:09.536
Don't--
you gotta trust me.

22:09.619 --> 22:11.705
You do not want
the answer to this.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.165
Talk to me.
Don't do your stone face!

22:13.248 --> 22:16.752
Trust me, don't press this
for your own protection.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.713
Do not pretend any of this
was about protecting me.

22:19.796 --> 22:21.465
Dad was taking us
all down.

22:21.548 --> 22:23.467
There were shell companies
all over the place

22:23.550 --> 22:25.093
- and Mom was in on it.
- You know what?

22:25.177 --> 22:26.803
Don't go, don't go.
You can't go now.

22:26.887 --> 22:28.263
You have to let me
finish this.
Mom knew.

22:28.346 --> 22:29.806
Mom cosigned on
some of the documents.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.684
Mom would've gone down, too,
but we made a choice!

22:32.768 --> 22:33.894
Don't go, Petra!

22:33.977 --> 22:36.063
( faint )
Mom and I made
a decision!

22:36.146 --> 22:38.356
It was the only way
to keep us all together!

22:38.440 --> 22:41.401
This is all a distraction
to keep the focus on me

<i>This is Liz Schoendienst</i>
<i>from BYU School of Geology.</i>

<i>You called about</i>

Yes, yes, I did.

Well, in a way,

24:12.909 --> 24:15.662
Uh, ah, Kentucky.

24:15.745 --> 24:17.414
UConn beat Kentucky.

24:17.497 --> 24:20.208
Okay,
trying Kentucky.

24:31.803 --> 24:34.222
undergrad,
business school,
law school.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.183
No Cliff Jones.

24:36.266 --> 24:40.395
What are the chances my brother
got Cliff Jones's name wrong?

24:40.478 --> 24:42.772
<i>I don't think your brother</i>
<i>gets that guy's name wrong.</i>

<i>He's had nothing else</i>
<i>to think about for</i>

<i>Then again,</i>
<i>I don't think Cliff Jones</i>

<i>I'd do this.</i>

25:12.302 --> 25:14.429
I'd say this
is a long shot...

25:15.680 --> 25:19.935
but then
I'd do this.

25:22.187 --> 25:23.855
Hmm.

25:23.939 --> 25:25.357
( chuckles )

25:25.440 --> 25:27.901
So, let's see

25:27.984 --> 25:32.239
if the old dog
can still...

25:32.322 --> 25:35.367
- What are you--
- Hang on, hang on.

25:38.912 --> 25:41.081
Mm, well.

25:41.164 --> 25:42.791
( chuckles )

25:45.710 --> 25:47.963
<i>( printer whirring )</i>

25:48.046 --> 25:50.924
I've searched
every Cliff or Clifford

25:51.007 --> 25:52.425
and found
no first names,

25:52.509 --> 25:54.678
but there was
a John Clifford,

25:54.761 --> 25:56.763
Kentucky Law
class of '87.

25:56.846 --> 25:59.641
Got his first DUI
in 1996,

25:59.724 --> 26:01.309
his second in 2007.

26:01.393 --> 26:04.354
And before you get
too optimistic about
meeting this guy,

26:04.437 --> 26:07.816
he most likely would've
gotten his third in 2014

26:07.899 --> 26:11.569
if he hadn't
driven his Peugeot
into the Mediterranean.

26:11.653 --> 26:12.904
( sighs )

26:17.701 --> 26:20.245
( gasps )
But he has the scar
that Eric was talking about.

26:20.328 --> 26:23.123
Looks like he banged it into
one too many steering wheels.

26:26.418 --> 26:30.005
Okay, when--
when something says
"survived by a spouse"

26:30.088 --> 26:34.634
and, uh, someone wanted
to reach that spouse...

26:34.718 --> 26:38.805
( chuckles )
It's seriously
late in France.

26:38.888 --> 26:42.309
Okay, but if someone waited
till an appropriate time
to call...

26:43.810 --> 26:46.354
how might someone
find that person?

26:46.438 --> 26:47.981
So, moving on.

26:50.066 --> 26:52.110
"Ansiers" Limited--

26:52.193 --> 26:55.989
1102 Mountain Road.

26:56.072 --> 26:59.409
Rusty Red Barrel Trust
buys 44 Summit View.

26:59.492 --> 27:02.787
Grandville Limited--
67 Summit View.

27:02.871 --> 27:05.498
Des Alps on Wayward.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.459
Montmartre
on Hidden Meadow.

27:07.542 --> 27:09.419
Peculiars over here.

27:09.502 --> 27:11.421
And Lavandou Holdings

27:11.504 --> 27:14.841
buys Olivia's property
from a charity.

27:14.924 --> 27:16.676
So, what's next?

27:18.428 --> 27:20.847
Oh, you know what?
Wait a minute.

27:23.141 --> 27:26.895
This-- this is what
I still don't understand.

27:26.978 --> 27:29.606
Why did Flor
go to Mexico?

27:29.689 --> 27:31.358
Isn't the question when?

27:31.441 --> 27:33.401
'Cause wouldn't that
tell you why?

27:35.153 --> 27:36.863
- Did I say
something good?
- Oh.

27:36.946 --> 27:39.449
Am I a Hardy boy?
I pick Joe.

27:39.532 --> 27:42.869
Okay, so,
Flor goes to Mexico.

27:42.952 --> 27:46.539
And then where
does that go?

27:46.623 --> 27:48.958
Ask Michael or Tom.

27:49.042 --> 27:52.128
They love to talk
about their private life.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.089
Speaking of which,

27:54.172 --> 27:56.341
okay, Olivia gets
in an argument with Eric.

27:56.424 --> 27:57.675
She's distraught,
she's angry.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.928
Why are you
the second person
she calls?

28:00.011 --> 28:02.764
When she "Walking Deads"
her way back in here,
I'll ask,

28:02.847 --> 28:04.599
'cause I've been
wondering that myself.

28:04.682 --> 28:06.267
Seriously?

28:06.351 --> 28:08.812
She leaves you
a three-minute message
on your voicemail,

28:08.895 --> 28:10.980
but first,

28:11.064 --> 28:15.151
she has a 52-second
conversation with Michael.

28:15.235 --> 28:16.986
Why is that?

28:17.070 --> 28:19.906
She's not calling him
for consolation.

28:19.989 --> 28:21.324
Why is she
calling him?

28:22.826 --> 28:24.244
She's angry.

28:27.664 --> 28:28.832
Yes.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.169
She's angry
at Michael.

28:35.088 --> 28:37.715
Eric confesses
he came into her life
to scam her land,

28:37.799 --> 28:42.178
and the first person
she calls is Michael, angry.

28:42.262 --> 28:44.097
Exactly!

28:44.180 --> 28:45.723
Give me a second.

28:49.352 --> 28:51.271
<i>( line ringing )</i>

28:51.354 --> 28:54.232
<i>( Horacio</i>

28:54.315 --> 28:56.651

29:11.040 --> 29:13.001
- Danger, Will Robinson.
- What?

29:13.084 --> 29:15.378
You told me
to alert you
if I saw Joel.

29:15.462 --> 29:17.672
Oh, thank you.

29:17.755 --> 29:19.466
Poor guy.
He's gonna be
so damn relieved.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.724
Joel! Hey, I've been
trying to reach you.

29:27.807 --> 29:29.642
What?
Uh, sorry.

29:29.726 --> 29:32.604
Um, something
personal-- home.

29:32.687 --> 29:34.731
I need to talk to you.
It's important.

29:34.814 --> 29:38.151
I, um--
I actually don't know
how to say this.

29:38.234 --> 29:41.946
Um, when we met,
when I came to Louisiana,

29:42.030 --> 29:44.574
I, um-- I wasn't
direct with you.

29:44.657 --> 29:46.451
I was dishonest,
actually.

29:46.534 --> 29:49.871
<i>I, um-- yes, I was hoping</i>
<i>to find something to--</i>

29:49.954 --> 29:53.082
-<i> to reopen Eric's case,</i>
<i>but in truth--</i>
-<i> ( phone buzzing )</i>

29:53.166 --> 29:55.710
Shit, it's Horacio.
I have to take this.

29:55.793 --> 29:59.547
Don't go anywhere,
please.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.300
-<i> ¿Hola?</i>

30:11.267 --> 30:13.811

- Okay.
-<i> ( in Spanish ) 2278.</i>

30:22.946 --> 30:25.240
- Okay.
-<i> ( in Spanish ) 6015.</i>

30:25.323 --> 30:27.992
Okay.

30:28.076 --> 30:31.329
<i>- Gracias, Horacio. Gracias.</i>
<i>- Claro, de nada.</i>

30:34.624 --> 30:35.667
Flor:
<i>Hello?</i>

30:35.750 --> 30:38.211
( speaking Spanish )

31:42.942 --> 31:43.943
<i>( hangs up )</i>

31:46.404 --> 31:47.697
Fuck.

31:53.369 --> 31:56.914

<i>( computer dialing,</i>
<i>line ringing )</i>

32:38.956 --> 32:40.958
<i>( ringing continues )</i>

32:45.004 --> 32:48.007
- Hello?
- Hi. Miss Clifford?

32:48.091 --> 32:50.677
- Yes. Miss Neill?
- Hi, yes. Thank you so much.

32:50.760 --> 32:51.844
Thank you so much
for picking up.

32:51.928 --> 32:53.054
I know it's early.

32:53.137 --> 32:56.391
I just have a couple
of quick questions

32:56.474 --> 32:58.226
about your late husband.

32:58.309 --> 33:02.271
I'm sorry about--
I don't know what word
you prefer--

33:02.355 --> 33:04.232
his passing.

33:04.315 --> 33:07.402
It was a long time ago.
It's fine.

33:07.485 --> 33:10.071
- What did you want to know?
- Well, I just--

33:10.154 --> 33:11.531
I guess, first off,

33:11.614 --> 33:14.409
who exactly did
your husband work for?

34:12.717 --> 34:14.051
Petra:
<i>This him?</i>

34:14.135 --> 34:16.512
That is most definitely him.

34:16.596 --> 34:20.141
- His real name
is John Clifford.
- How did you find him?

34:20.224 --> 34:23.311
Actually, with a little help
from the guy who put you
in here.

34:56.094 --> 34:59.639
Alan told me you wanted
Michael and myself.

34:59.722 --> 35:05.353
- You remember from yesterday,
Michael's in the Caribbean.
- I see.

35:05.436 --> 35:10.066
This meeting,
what is it about?

35:10.149 --> 35:12.652
Beryllium.

35:12.735 --> 35:14.654
I didn't know much
about it before.

35:14.737 --> 35:18.658
It's used
in the space program,
weapons manufacturing,

35:18.741 --> 35:21.118
medical research,
cell phones.

35:21.202 --> 35:22.870
In the 1950s,
Michael's grandfather

35:22.954 --> 35:25.164
lost a dispute
over the mining rights to it

35:25.248 --> 35:27.834
in Warren's Ridge.

35:27.917 --> 35:31.379
Do the letters HPCIC
mean anything to you?

35:31.462 --> 35:36.592
It stands for "high-performance
chelation ion chromatography."

35:36.676 --> 35:40.221
As an advisor to the inheritor
of some of the largest mining
interests in the state,

35:40.304 --> 35:42.723
I'm surprised
it hasn't crossed
your screen.

35:42.807 --> 35:46.978
Point is, it can detect
trace elements of metals
like beryllium in rivers,

35:47.061 --> 35:49.981
like the one that runs
under not just Olivia's property

35:50.064 --> 35:52.358
but six other
parcels of land,

35:52.441 --> 35:57.196
all owned
by trusts with names
like Hornflower Holdings,

35:57.280 --> 36:01.701
Ponsiers LLC,
Ochre Bridge Partnership.

36:04.954 --> 36:07.373
Do these sound familiar?

36:07.456 --> 36:09.041
Each one
is an obscure reference

36:09.125 --> 36:13.337
to a painting that hangs
just down the hall
in the Red Room,

36:13.421 --> 36:14.922
just like Lavandou.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.633
I'm sorry, is there
a point to this

36:17.717 --> 36:20.595
besides showing me
how adept you are

36:20.678 --> 36:23.598
at picking your way
through Wikipedia?

36:25.433 --> 36:29.061
HPCIC became
commercially available
right around the time

36:29.145 --> 36:32.648
Michael began
casually inquiring about
buying Olivia's property.

36:32.732 --> 36:35.192
But the stubborn narcissist
was holding on to it

36:35.276 --> 36:36.736
for emotional reasons.

36:36.819 --> 36:38.237
She wouldn't sell.

36:38.321 --> 36:42.199
Not at 7, not at 8,
not even at 8 1/2 million.

36:43.743 --> 36:47.580
So, why didn't
he offer 15? 20?

36:47.663 --> 36:50.750
Because it would have
tipped her to its actual value,

36:50.833 --> 36:52.585
and she never
would have sold.

36:52.668 --> 36:55.755
- I'm sorry, I still
don't see--
- My angle.

36:55.838 --> 36:59.800
Yes, it is
all about angle,
isn't it?

36:59.884 --> 37:01.385
Enter my brother.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.346
He and his friend Casey
made a boneheaded attempt

37:03.429 --> 37:08.434
to scam someone far smarter,
far more powerful
than themselves.

37:08.517 --> 37:14.106
And that smarter person,
you, quite wisely kept
Eric's number.

37:14.190 --> 37:17.610
<i>I assume you know</i>
<i>John Clifford.</i>

37:17.693 --> 37:19.403
<i>His widow confirmed</i>
<i>that he worked</i>

37:19.487 --> 37:21.614
<i>in your Cockburn Town,</i>
<i>Turks and Caicos office.</i>

37:21.697 --> 37:23.532
<i>She also, by the way,</i>
<i>has her suspicions</i>

37:23.616 --> 37:25.952
<i>about his</i>
<i>accidental death,</i>

37:26.035 --> 37:28.663
<i>but we'll save that</i>
<i>for another day.</i>

37:28.746 --> 37:32.458
Anyway, John Clifford,
under the name Cliff Jones,

37:32.541 --> 37:35.544
contacted Eric
for one reason--

37:35.628 --> 37:38.506
to talk Olivia
into selling her property.

37:38.589 --> 37:42.259
But Eric-- and here's
that word again--

37:42.343 --> 37:43.761
he got emotional.

37:43.844 --> 37:46.597
He fell in love
and confessed.

37:46.681 --> 37:49.892
So she got emotional
and called Michael.

37:49.976 --> 37:52.645
<i>But as we've already</i>
<i>established,</i>

37:52.728 --> 37:55.856
<i>there's no reasoning</i>
<i>with emotion.</i>

37:55.940 --> 37:59.318
Well, this is
quite a story
you're weaving.

37:59.402 --> 38:00.611
<i>I acknowledge it is.</i>

38:00.695 --> 38:04.281
But I don't think
you actually believe it.

38:04.365 --> 38:06.993
Because if you did,

38:07.076 --> 38:09.495
why would you put yourself
in this jeopardy?

38:09.578 --> 38:12.331
Perhaps I took
precautions.

38:14.667 --> 38:18.462
Except for
the most important one--

38:18.546 --> 38:21.549
making sure your facts
are correct.

38:21.632 --> 38:27.555
Thelma Clifford has a history
of bipolar disorder

38:27.638 --> 38:29.932
and delusions
of persecution,

38:30.016 --> 38:32.727
<i>which is why her spurious</i>
<i>and, I might add,</i>

38:32.810 --> 38:37.023
<i>actionable</i>
<i>attempt at blackmail</i>
<i>was already thrown out</i>

38:37.106 --> 38:38.816
<i>by the Cockburn Town</i>
<i>magistrate</i>

38:38.899 --> 38:41.235
<i>and state and local</i>
<i>courts here.</i>

38:41.318 --> 38:44.196
So her claims are not new.

38:46.991 --> 38:48.451
Yours are.

38:48.534 --> 38:51.412
<i>And they're reckless.</i>

38:51.495 --> 38:52.705
<i>And they're wrong.</i>

38:52.788 --> 38:55.291
<i>Michael was here</i>
<i>that night.</i>

38:55.374 --> 38:57.043
<i>His cell phone</i>
<i>proves it.</i>

38:57.126 --> 38:58.878
He left it here
when he went down.

38:58.961 --> 39:01.922
- He never went down.
-<i> He was seen going down.</i>

39:03.841 --> 39:05.634
- By who?
-<i> The maid.</i>

39:07.678 --> 39:11.140
<i>He went down the hill</i>
<i>to shut Olivia up.</i>

39:11.223 --> 39:13.350
<i>She was being Olivia,</i>

39:13.434 --> 39:17.021
<i>so he hit her,</i>
<i>maybe accidentally,</i>

39:17.104 --> 39:18.355
<i>but she fell.</i>

39:18.439 --> 39:20.524
<i>Now suddenly,</i>
<i>it's assault.</i>

39:20.608 --> 39:23.652
And she still
won't shut up.

39:23.736 --> 39:25.029
Finally, a hammer.

39:25.112 --> 39:27.323
Three times
until she was dead.

39:27.406 --> 39:30.910
Then he dumps her
in the mine on the edge
of his property.

39:32.703 --> 39:34.246
You have proof?

39:34.330 --> 39:36.999
<i>I have</i>
<i>a sworn statement.</i>

39:37.083 --> 39:38.584
Do you?

39:38.667 --> 39:40.961
<i>Flor Castro saw him</i>
<i>leave in a rush,</i>

39:41.045 --> 39:43.089
<i>then return</i>
<i>65 minutes later</i>

39:43.172 --> 39:44.715
<i>bathed in sweat,</i>
<i>mud, snow,</i>

39:44.799 --> 39:47.968
<i>and some sort</i>
<i>of brownish-red substance</i>

39:48.052 --> 39:50.638
<i>that she couldn't explain.</i>

39:50.721 --> 39:53.891
<i>Four hours later,</i>
<i>she was told, by you,</i>

39:53.974 --> 39:57.103
<i>to leave the country</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

39:57.186 --> 40:00.439
You can try and contact her,
but you would have to know
her new last name

40:00.523 --> 40:03.067
and the country
she's now living in.

40:07.446 --> 40:09.281
I believe you're bluffing.

40:17.206 --> 40:18.582
I'm going to make
a phone call.

40:20.334 --> 40:22.002
<i>While I'm gone,</i>
<i>I would encourage you</i>

40:22.086 --> 40:25.422
<i>to reconsider the...</i>

40:25.506 --> 40:28.717
<i>substance and intent</i>
<i>of this meeting.</i>

40:30.928 --> 40:32.680
When I'm back,
if you're not here,

40:32.763 --> 40:36.392
I'll assume you thought better
of your decision to visit.

40:36.475 --> 40:37.852
I'll be here.

40:51.907 --> 40:53.784
( sighs )

41:26.901 --> 41:28.861
Well,
you're not accurate

41:28.944 --> 41:30.571
about any of this,
but I am curious.

41:30.654 --> 41:32.239
What's the ask here?

41:33.782 --> 41:35.910
You mean in exchange
for my silence?

41:35.993 --> 41:38.537
<i>There's a reason</i>
<i>you came here like this.</i>

41:38.621 --> 41:40.206
<i>Let's not kid ourselves.</i>

41:42.625 --> 41:45.294
<i>What's my ask?</i>

41:45.377 --> 41:47.046
That is the question.

41:56.847 --> 41:58.057
<i>My ask?</i>

41:59.642 --> 42:01.101
<i>What I want...</i>

42:04.772 --> 42:05.856
is the Red Room.

42:07.524 --> 42:08.692
The Red Room?

42:11.028 --> 42:12.696
<i>The</i> Red Room?

42:14.198 --> 42:16.533
I would like...

42:16.617 --> 42:19.411
the Red Room, yes.

42:19.495 --> 42:20.663
Excuse me a moment.

42:47.481 --> 42:49.608
You rich guys
have fast planes.

42:53.779 --> 42:56.115
Do you know Joel Hurley?

42:56.198 --> 42:58.075
<i>I do.</i>

42:58.158 --> 43:00.119
You might want
to check the news.

43:00.202 --> 43:03.163
<i>He's just confessed</i>
<i>to the murder of Olivia Lake.</i>

43:16.593 --> 43:19.346
Alan:
<i>Wow, a sworn statement</i>
<i>from the maid,</i>

43:19.430 --> 43:20.889
<i>that's a bold play.</i>

43:20.973 --> 43:22.391
<i>Very ballsy.</i>

43:22.474 --> 43:25.728
Well, that's when Tom got up
and went in the other room.

43:25.811 --> 43:27.938
<i>So, you think</i>
<i>you had him on the ropes?</i>

43:29.565 --> 43:32.609
Now, I can say this--
it's a compelling narrative.

43:32.693 --> 43:36.697
I can see how the dots
all connect.

43:36.780 --> 43:40.326
There's one pothole,
though, and it's a big one.

43:40.409 --> 43:42.536
<i>Joel confessed.</i>

43:42.619 --> 43:46.123
<i>And I should tell you,</i>
<i>my guys are telling me</i>

43:46.206 --> 43:49.626
<i>Joel passed his polygraph.</i>

43:49.710 --> 43:52.838
- Passed meaning...?
-<i> His confession's</i>
<i>gonna hold.</i>

43:52.921 --> 43:55.549
<i>He's telling the truth.</i>

43:55.632 --> 43:58.218
Or he believes
he's telling the truth.

43:58.302 --> 44:00.220
<i>( music playing )</i>

44:00.304 --> 44:01.972
Okay, yeah.

44:03.223 --> 44:04.350
Well...

44:07.686 --> 44:10.105
- ( sighs )
-<i> Let me ask you something.</i>

44:10.189 --> 44:13.025
Why did you go in there

44:13.108 --> 44:14.777
to Tom and Michael?

44:16.362 --> 44:18.364
To get them to admit it.

44:18.447 --> 44:20.699
- I mean, somebody had
to take these guys on.
-<i> Oh, I don't buy it.</i>

44:20.783 --> 44:23.077
What were you really after?

44:23.160 --> 44:25.663
What was your big move?

44:33.504 --> 44:35.297
There was no big move.

44:35.381 --> 44:36.924
No?

44:37.007 --> 44:40.135
Just wanted
to get a firsthand look
at the inevitable?

44:41.762 --> 44:44.223
You mean
that they were never
gonna go down.

44:45.933 --> 44:47.851
Could be they outman you.

44:47.935 --> 44:50.437
Could be
they outspend you.

44:50.521 --> 44:53.107
Or it's just blind,
dumb luck.

44:54.525 --> 44:56.568
<i>People like that</i>

44:56.652 --> 44:58.404
<i>just don't lose.</i>

45:03.784 --> 45:05.327
You got the case
reopened.

45:05.411 --> 45:07.830
It was the entire reason
you came here.

45:07.913 --> 45:10.749
I don't understand
why you're not bouncing
off the walls.

45:12.626 --> 45:14.628
If it were me,

45:14.711 --> 45:18.132
I'd be taking
yes for an answer
and moving on.

45:39.945 --> 45:41.280
Man:
<i>Petra?</i>

45:41.363 --> 45:43.115
<i>You have a visitor</i>
<i>out in the hallway.</i>

45:45.117 --> 45:46.368
Thank you.

45:55.961 --> 45:57.337
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:57.421 --> 45:59.256
- Miss Neill?
- Petra.

45:59.339 --> 46:01.967
- How can I help you?
- Hi. My name is Lisa Phelps.

46:02.050 --> 46:05.345
I'm putting together
a book I hope will be

46:05.429 --> 46:08.932
the definitive book
on the legacy of Olivia Lake.

46:09.016 --> 46:11.143
Oh, wow.

46:11.226 --> 46:14.980
Um, I'm sorry,
how old are you?

46:15.063 --> 46:16.982
Oh. I'm 17.

46:17.065 --> 46:19.902
And it's more like
a personal narrative,

46:19.985 --> 46:24.114
stories of people's lives
she really changed,
like mine.

46:24.198 --> 46:27.201
A bunch of other kids
from the program did pieces

46:27.284 --> 46:28.785
and so did your brother.

46:28.869 --> 46:29.995
He said I should
talk to you.

46:30.078 --> 46:33.832
Oh, my brother
did a-- a painting?

46:33.916 --> 46:36.376
( chuckles )
No, he wrote an essay.

46:36.460 --> 46:38.795
Oh.

46:38.879 --> 46:40.589
Is this for
a school project?

46:40.672 --> 46:42.424
It's for Embry House.

46:42.508 --> 46:44.051
- Her publisher?
- Yeah.

46:44.134 --> 46:46.929
They're doing
the anniversary reprint
of "Whose Woods,"

46:47.012 --> 46:49.306
and I kind of thought
this could be a companion
for it.

46:49.389 --> 46:54.228
Actually, I spent the last
four and a half years
working on it.

46:54.311 --> 46:56.355
I didn't sell it
till two weeks ago.

46:56.438 --> 46:58.398
You sold it?

46:58.482 --> 47:00.025
On your own?

47:00.108 --> 47:03.028
Olivia said the only person
that could take me off my path

47:03.111 --> 47:06.365
is myself
if I stop walking.

47:43.026 --> 47:44.570
- Hello.
- Hi.

47:44.653 --> 47:46.321
Let me know if you have
any questions.

47:46.405 --> 47:47.948
Thank you.

47:48.031 --> 47:49.449
Just looking.

49:33.011 --> 49:36.390
