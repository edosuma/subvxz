<b>Heavens Arena.</b>

00:05.010 --> 00:10.990
<b>The 251-story, 991-meter 
building is a mecca for fighters.</b>

00:11.520 --> 00:13.530
<b>When combatants win a fight,</b>

00:14.170 --> 00:17.420
<b>they may advance by one class,</b>

00:17.420 --> 00:20.460
<b>and receive a corresponding reward.</b>

00:20.460 --> 00:22.030
<b>After reaching the 100th floor,</b>

00:22.030 --> 00:24.170
<b>you are assigned a private room.</b>

00:24.790 --> 00:26.600
<b>After reaching the 200th floor,</b>

00:26.600 --> 00:32.690
<b>you receive the right to challenge 
the strongest fighters,</b>

00:32.690 --> 00:37.010
<b>the Floor Masters, in an intense 
battle of survival.</b>

00:37.630 --> 00:40.880
<b>This is the best stage</b>

00:40.880 --> 00:42.890
<b>a warrior could ask for.</b>

02:06.980 --> 02:10.270
<b>Then, your brother is able to use Nen?</b>

02:11.040 --> 02:13.980
<b>I need to know what Nen 
and Ren even mean!</b>

02:15.030 --> 02:16.650
<b>I'll agree to the full learning process</b>

02:16.650 --> 02:18.650
<b>rather than a quick explanation!</b>

02:21.490 --> 02:23.160
<b>I understand.</b>

02:23.160 --> 02:28.160
<b>Nen x And x <i>Nen</i></b>

02:28.990 --> 02:30.420
<b>After Killua fought Zushi,</b>

02:30.420 --> 02:32.300
<b>the young Shingen-ryu practitioner,</b>

02:32.300 --> 02:36.500
<b>Zushi mentioned the four major principles.</b>

02:37.850 --> 02:40.600
<b>Gon and Killua are about to learn the secret</b>

02:40.600 --> 02:43.250
<b>of those principles from Zushi's master, Wing.</b>

02:45.850 --> 02:46.900
<b>Do I have your attention?</b>

02:47.500 --> 02:50.940
<b>Nen means to burn your own soul.</b>

02:52.390 --> 02:53.310
<b>In other words,</b>

02:53.310 --> 02:55.260
<b>it tests your strength of will.</b>

02:53.340 --> 02:56.320
<b>Burn</b>

02:54.590 --> 02:56.320
<b>Nen</b>

02:56.790 --> 02:59.340
<b>And the four major principles are part</b>

02:59.340 --> 03:01.820
<b>of a training curriculum for 
strengthening your will.</b>

03:02.150 --> 03:04.010
<b>Strengthening your will?</b>

03:04.010 --> 03:05.110
<b>Training?</b>

03:05.820 --> 03:06.700
<b>That's correct.</b>

03:06.720 --> 03:12.290
<b>Ten</b>

03:06.720 --> 03:12.580
<b>Focus</b>

03:07.620 --> 03:09.920
<b>Ten means to focus your soul to a single point,</b>

03:09.920 --> 03:12.510
<b>to increase awareness of your ego and goals.</b>

03:12.750 --> 03:15.500
<b>Express</b>

03:13.040 --> 03:15.210
<b>Zetsu</b>

03:13.250 --> 03:15.540
<b>Zetsu means to express yourself in words.</b>

03:15.630 --> 03:18.090
<b>Temper</b>

03:15.920 --> 03:17.670
<b>Ren</b>

03:16.180 --> 03:17.690
<b>Ren means to temper that will.</b>

03:18.210 --> 03:21.470
<b>Act</b>

03:18.380 --> 03:21.130
<b>Hatsu</b>

03:18.690 --> 03:21.470
<b>And Hatsu means to act upon that will.</b>

03:21.490 --> 03:28.100
<b>Four Major Principles</b>

03:21.490 --> 03:28.100
<b>







Focus 

Express 

Temper 

Act</b>

03:22.280 --> 03:23.310
<b>Ten.</b>

03:23.310 --> 03:24.180
<b>Zetsu.</b>

03:24.180 --> 03:25.070
<b>Ren.</b>

03:25.070 --> 03:26.260
<b>Hatsu.</b>

03:26.260 --> 03:28.100
<b>Those are the four major principles.</b>

03:28.400 --> 03:32.600
<b>Killua-kun, Zushi tempered his "refusal 
to lose," during his fight with you.</b>

03:42.460 --> 03:45.230
<b>So, allow me to demonstrate.</b>

03:45.230 --> 03:46.120
<b>Killua-kun...</b>

03:47.710 --> 03:50.310
<b>I think I'm going to kill you now.</b>

03:50.990 --> 03:52.330
<b>Are you ready?</b>

03:52.330 --> 03:53.710
<b>Yeah, sure.</b>

03:53.710 --> 03:54.630
<b>It's not happening.</b>

03:55.660 --> 03:57.380
<b>Then I'll take this step-by-step.</b>

03:57.970 --> 03:59.380
<b>First comes Ten.</b>

04:00.900 --> 04:03.270
<b>I focus my soul into a single point.</b>

04:05.520 --> 04:06.810
<b>Zetsu.</b>

04:06.810 --> 04:10.890
<b>You can express yourself mentally or verbally.</b>

04:15.040 --> 04:16.400
<b>I will kill you.</b>

04:58.750 --> 05:00.110
<b>That was Ren.</b>

05:00.910 --> 05:03.700
<b>If I temper my will enough,</b>

05:03.700 --> 05:05.950
<b>then I can act. Hatsu.</b>

05:06.840 --> 05:08.210
<b>If your will is strong enough,</b>

05:08.210 --> 05:10.600
<b>you can make your opponent back down, 
without moving a muscle.</b>

05:10.600 --> 05:13.010
<b>The concept of bluffing derives from this.</b>

05:14.920 --> 05:17.920
<b>Ren hardens that which is soft,</b>

05:17.920 --> 05:22.170
<b>and you lose the ability to 
correct an incorrect idea.</b>

05:22.710 --> 05:25.360
<b>Therefore, you should avoid using Ren</b>

05:25.360 --> 05:27.390
<b>until your soul has fully matured.</b>

05:27.390 --> 05:31.560
<b>Right now, you boys and Zushi 
should be training your souls.</b>

05:37.630 --> 05:38.880
<b>Let's go, Gon.</b>

05:39.680 --> 05:42.180
<b>If you wish to learn about Nen,</b>

05:42.180 --> 05:45.450
<b>you should focus on mastering Ten.</b>

05:45.450 --> 05:46.990
<b>If you master Ten,</b>

05:46.990 --> 05:49.960
<b>you will no longer feel the pressure 
of an opponent's will.</b>

05:54.650 --> 05:56.400
<b>Thank you very much!</b>

06:01.100 --> 06:02.850
<b>Wait up, Killua!</b>

06:04.900 --> 06:05.720
<b>Zushi.</b>

06:05.720 --> 06:06.480
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

06:06.980 --> 06:08.690
<b>Let's begin training.</b>

06:08.690 --> 06:09.840
<b>O-Osu!</b>

06:10.970 --> 06:12.380
<b>First...</b>

06:16.700 --> 06:17.600
<b>He was lying?</b>

06:17.600 --> 06:20.920
<b>Yeah. The explanation made perfect sense,</b>

06:20.920 --> 06:23.490
<b>and Wing is clearly very strong.</b>

06:24.300 --> 06:26.510
<b>But his story had holes.</b>

06:26.510 --> 06:27.240
<b>Huh?</b>

06:27.730 --> 06:29.470
<b>Zushi's toughness.</b>

06:29.970 --> 06:33.620
<b>He kept getting up after 
I knocked him down.</b>

06:33.620 --> 06:35.800
<b>I was getting irritated,</b>

06:35.800 --> 06:38.920
<b>so I used all of my strength 
during my last attack.</b>

06:49.590 --> 06:50.630
<b>Brat!</b>

07:00.520 --> 07:01.480
<b>Crap!</b>

07:04.980 --> 07:07.870
<b>He flew out of the ring!</b>

07:07.870 --> 07:12.000
<b>Even an amateur can see that 
he's headed for the hospital!</b>

07:18.590 --> 07:21.110
<b>Oh! He stood back up.</b>

07:21.110 --> 07:23.020
<b>Zushi must be invincible.</b>

07:26.290 --> 07:27.550
<b><i>Impossible.</i></b>

07:28.180 --> 07:31.430
<b>However, the referee has awarded 
a critical hit and knockdown.</b>

07:31.430 --> 07:35.390
<b>Killua wins by TKO, with eleven total points.</b>

07:38.060 --> 07:42.050
<b>Willpower didn't keep him standing.</b>

07:42.400 --> 07:44.680
<b>He's hiding some other secret.</b>

07:50.650 --> 07:52.200
<b>What's wrong, Zushi?</b>

07:52.710 --> 07:54.450
<b>Your Ten is unstable.</b>

07:56.310 --> 07:57.670
<b>Master...</b>

07:57.670 --> 07:58.450
<b>Hmm?</b>

08:00.120 --> 08:02.460
<b>Why did you lie to them?</b>

08:02.760 --> 08:03.740
<b>Lie?</b>

08:04.470 --> 08:07.060
<b>You mean my explanation?</b>

08:07.060 --> 08:08.090
<b>Yes!</b>

08:08.580 --> 08:11.830
<b>The four major principles are 
Ten, Zetsu, Ren, and Hatsu.</b>

08:11.830 --> 08:14.090
<b>But they don't mean what you said.</b>

08:14.660 --> 08:17.350
<b>Did you lie because they aren't your students?</b>

08:18.800 --> 08:20.600
<b>I didn't lie.</b>

08:20.600 --> 08:24.750
<b><i>Nen</i> is an important method 
for training your soul.</b>

08:27.670 --> 08:31.360
<b>Force</b>

08:27.710 --> 08:29.800
<b>However, it's true that I can't teach <i>Nen</i></b>

08:32.000 --> 08:36.340
<b>to someone who is not a student.</b>

08:37.240 --> 08:41.060
<b>So I used the other Nen as a hint, 
to help them along.</b>

08:41.810 --> 08:44.000
<b>If <i>Nen</i> is used the wrong way,</b>

08:44.690 --> 08:47.250
<b>it can become a terrible weapon.</b>

08:48.760 --> 08:49.930
<b>For example...</b>

09:18.650 --> 09:22.790
<b>You could turn a piece of paper 
into a blade to harm others,</b>

09:23.320 --> 09:28.290
<b>while hardening your body, 
as a defensive measure.</b>

09:28.950 --> 09:31.690
<b>With enough work, anyone can use <i>Nen</i>.</b>

09:32.330 --> 09:33.340
<b>That is why</b>

09:33.800 --> 09:36.940
<b>you must be careful when 
deciding to teach it.</b>

09:39.460 --> 09:41.170
<b>Master...</b>

09:41.170 --> 09:42.430
<b>I didn't</b>

09:42.850 --> 09:45.610
<b>have a chance to read that book yet...</b>

09:47.340 --> 09:49.800
<b>And that can of juice was mine...</b>

09:50.940 --> 09:53.010
<b>S-Sorry...</b>

10:00.790 --> 10:03.730
<b>It's time for the day's biggest match!</b>

10:03.730 --> 10:06.800
<b>The rookies Killua and Gon have advanced</b>

10:06.800 --> 10:11.210
<b>to the 190th floor without dropping a fight.</b>

10:11.540 --> 10:16.220
<b>Will they be able to keep moving on?</b>

10:16.750 --> 10:18.090
<b>Okay, everyone...</b>

10:18.090 --> 10:20.860
<b>Get ready to press your gamble switches!</b>

10:24.310 --> 10:29.600
<b>Unfortunately, your shove won't work on me.</b>

10:30.020 --> 10:31.350
<b>That's because</b>

10:31.350 --> 10:35.310
<b>I am as slippery as a snake,</b>

10:35.310 --> 10:39.360
<b>with sharp fangs,
to bite at your vital points.</b>

10:43.550 --> 10:46.440
<b>You may sport a vicious chop,</b>

10:46.440 --> 10:49.770
<b>but you can't overcome these muscles!</b>

10:49.770 --> 10:51.170
<b>That's because...</b>

10:52.370 --> 10:55.750
<b>I'm totally ripped!</b>

10:58.830 --> 10:59.880
<b>Begin!</b>

11:19.680 --> 11:22.460
<b>Critical hit and knockdown...</b>

11:22.460 --> 11:23.700
<b>Three points.</b>

11:23.700 --> 11:25.360
<b>Knockout!</b>

11:26.240 --> 11:28.330
<b>The winner is Gon!</b>

11:30.740 --> 11:32.780
<b>Critical hit and knockdown...</b>

11:32.780 --> 11:33.960
<b>Three points.</b>

11:34.420 --> 11:35.420
<b>Knockout!</b>

11:35.420 --> 11:36.710
<b>The winner is Killua!</b>

11:40.620 --> 11:44.360
<b>Once again, Gon and Killua have knocked 
out their opponents with one attack.</b>

11:45.010 --> 11:49.820
<b>And both of them have 
successfully cleared the 190s!</b>

11:50.640 --> 11:53.850
<b>Both have advanced to the 200s!</b>

11:54.240 --> 11:56.670
<b>They've already reached the 200s?!</b>

11:56.670 --> 11:57.690
<b>Zushi.</b>

11:58.710 --> 12:00.030
<b>Master!</b>

12:00.530 --> 12:04.160
<b>Killua-kun and Gon-kun have 
already reached the 200s?</b>

12:04.700 --> 12:07.870
<b>Yes, they're amazing!</b>

12:07.870 --> 12:09.900
<b>I need to train more...</b>

12:10.900 --> 12:11.960
<b>Huh?</b>

12:11.960 --> 12:13.350
<b>Master?</b>

12:22.670 --> 12:24.640
<b><i>I have no choice.</i></b>

12:26.300 --> 12:27.930
<b>Enjoy.</b>

12:34.920 --> 12:37.870
<b>What's the 200th floor like?</b>

12:37.870 --> 12:38.980
<b>Beats me.</b>

12:38.980 --> 12:42.030
<b>I've never been up here before.</b>

12:55.200 --> 12:56.470
<b>Wow!</b>

12:56.470 --> 12:59.600
<b>The 200th floor is so fancy!</b>

12:59.600 --> 13:01.050
<b>Where's the receptionist?</b>

13:01.980 --> 13:03.270
<b>This way?</b>

13:07.970 --> 13:09.510
<b>We finally made it.</b>

13:09.510 --> 13:10.430
<b>Yeah.</b>

13:25.710 --> 13:27.000
<b><i>What is this?</i></b>

13:27.000 --> 13:30.550
<b><i>All of a sudden, it feels like 
we're in a monster-filled jungle.</i></b>

13:32.370 --> 13:35.430
<b><i>But this is an ordinary hallway.</i></b>

13:43.540 --> 13:44.830
<b>Let's go.</b>

13:44.830 --> 13:45.990
<b>We can do this!</b>

14:05.610 --> 14:06.790
<b><i>This isn't working...</i></b>

14:06.790 --> 14:08.390
<b><i>I can't move forward!</i></b>

14:08.390 --> 14:09.900
<b><i>I don't want to move forward...</i></b>

14:10.630 --> 14:11.990
<b>This is murderous intent,</b>

14:11.990 --> 14:14.490
<b>aimed at us.</b>

14:16.130 --> 14:18.050
<b>Hey! Who's there?</b>

14:18.050 --> 14:20.500
<b>Show yourself!</b>

14:27.220 --> 14:29.230
<b>Killua-sama and Gon-sama, correct?</b>

14:29.770 --> 14:32.140
<b>The receptionist's desk is over here,</b>

14:32.140 --> 14:36.890
<b>so please register for a 200s match today.</b>

14:37.720 --> 14:39.610
<b>You won't be able to register</b>

14:39.610 --> 14:42.760
<b>after midnight, so please be careful.</b>

14:44.150 --> 14:46.850
<b>Was she the source of all that?</b>

14:47.490 --> 14:48.650
<b>I can't tell.</b>

14:49.520 --> 14:51.920
<b>By the way, there are currently</b>

14:51.920 --> 14:55.250
<b>one hundred, seventy-three 
contestants in the 200s class.</b>

14:56.540 --> 14:59.150
<b>And starting from the 200s,</b>

14:59.150 --> 15:01.940
<b>all weapons are allowed in matches.</b>

15:01.940 --> 15:03.920
<b>So please use whatever you have.</b>

15:04.720 --> 15:09.300
<b>Also, you will no longer receive 
prize money in the 200s class.</b>

15:10.060 --> 15:12.530
<b>You will fight only for glory,</b>

15:12.530 --> 15:15.060
<b>so please understand that
 if you're going to participate.</b>

15:25.870 --> 15:26.840
<b>Huh?!</b>

15:37.670 --> 15:39.550
<b>H-Hisoka...</b>

15:40.200 --> 15:41.960
<b>Why are you here?</b>

15:42.620 --> 15:44.990
<b>It's hardly that strange.</b>

15:45.510 --> 15:47.660
<b>I love to fight,</b>

15:47.660 --> 15:50.130
<b>and this is a temple to fighting.</b>

15:51.410 --> 15:55.100
<b>And why are you here?</b>

15:55.390 --> 15:57.310
<b>Just kidding...</b>

15:57.830 --> 15:59.610
<b>This was no coincidence.</b>

15:59.610 --> 16:01.520
<b>I've been waiting for you.</b>

16:02.080 --> 16:05.860
<b>Remember how you ordered airship 
tickets over the cybernet?</b>

16:07.180 --> 16:09.250
<b>With a little effort,</b>

16:09.250 --> 16:13.660
<b>it's possible to determine where 
and when someone will arrive.</b>

16:14.750 --> 16:15.690
<b>Well,</b>

16:15.690 --> 16:19.070
<b>I knew you would come here eventually.</b>

16:20.010 --> 16:21.620
<b>And so,</b>

16:21.620 --> 16:26.130
<b>as a veteran, I have a warning for you.</b>

16:27.840 --> 16:31.260
<b>It's still too early for you boys</b>

16:32.910 --> 16:34.760
<b>to step on this floor.</b>

16:40.290 --> 16:43.210
<b>How early depends on your efforts.</b>

16:44.420 --> 16:46.270
<b>Leave for now.</b>

16:46.270 --> 16:48.740
<b>It's too early right now.</b>

16:48.740 --> 16:50.030
<b>That's stupid!</b>

16:50.030 --> 16:51.810
<b>We just got up here...</b>

16:55.990 --> 16:57.690
<b>I won't let you pass.</b>

16:58.340 --> 17:01.080
<b>Not that you could, anyway.</b>

17:03.040 --> 17:05.040
<b><i>Wh-What is...</i></b>

17:05.450 --> 17:06.790
<b><i>...this?</i></b>

17:15.260 --> 17:16.860
<b>Don't be reckless!</b>

17:23.350 --> 17:24.970
<b>Wing-san!</b>

17:24.970 --> 17:26.440
<b>You have no defense</b>

17:26.800 --> 17:29.170
<b>against his <i>Nen</i>.</b>

17:29.170 --> 17:30.070
<b>Nen?</b>

17:30.070 --> 17:33.400
<b>Right now, you are like someone standing</b>

17:33.400 --> 17:36.450
<b>naked in a blizzard, wondering why it is cold.</b>

17:36.450 --> 17:40.730
<b>If you continue to strain 
your body, you may die.</b>

17:40.730 --> 17:42.350
<b>This is Nen?!</b>

17:42.350 --> 17:45.710
<b>He can stop us from moving 
forward through willpower?</b>

17:45.710 --> 17:47.230
<b>Don't lie!</b>

17:47.230 --> 17:49.210
<b>Yes, I was lying.</b>

17:50.300 --> 17:53.720
<b>Though technically, I wasn't lying completely.</b>

17:54.160 --> 17:56.570
<b>I will teach you the truth about <i>Nen</i>.</b>

17:56.570 --> 17:59.850
<b>So retreat for now.</b>

18:02.340 --> 18:03.640
<b>Hey, receptionist lady.</b>

18:03.640 --> 18:05.040
<b>Oh, yes?</b>

18:05.040 --> 18:08.850
<b>What happens if we don't register 
for a fight today?</b>

18:09.260 --> 18:13.620
<b>Gon-sama, you would have to 
start again, from the first floor.</b>

18:13.620 --> 18:15.240
<b>However, Killua-sama</b>

18:15.240 --> 18:17.880
<b>refused to register once before.</b>

18:17.880 --> 18:20.550
<b>So if he fails to register again,</b>

18:20.550 --> 18:22.490
<b>his commitment will be questioned,</b>

18:23.000 --> 18:26.250
<b>and he will be banned from participating.</b>

18:29.760 --> 18:31.380
<b>Hey, Wing-san.</b>

18:31.890 --> 18:33.630
<b>If we back down now,</b>

18:33.630 --> 18:35.380
<b>will we be able to return here</b>

18:35.660 --> 18:36.750
<b>by midnight?</b>

18:45.780 --> 18:48.020
<b>That depends on you.</b>

18:55.570 --> 18:57.530
<b>Simply put,</b>

18:58.310 --> 19:00.070
<b>this is <i>Nen</i>.</b>

19:00.070 --> 19:02.950
<b><i>Nen</i> refers to the ability</b>

19:02.950 --> 19:05.160
<b>to manipulate your aura,</b>

19:05.180 --> 19:08.160
<b>Force</b>

19:05.410 --> 19:08.160
<b><i>Nen</i></b>

19:05.620 --> 19:08.160
<b>also known as life energy.</b>

19:08.610 --> 19:12.920
<b>Every person possesses a 
small amount of life energy.</b>

19:12.920 --> 19:16.670
<b>But in most cases, it's simply discharged.</b>

19:17.530 --> 19:19.410
<b>The ability to build up</b>

19:19.410 --> 19:23.430
<b>a shroud of life energy is known as <i>Ten</i>.</b>

19:20.700 --> 19:23.430
<b>Shroud</b>

19:24.130 --> 19:26.670
<b>You can make your body harder,</b>

19:25.990 --> 19:31.250
<b>Shroud</b>

19:25.990 --> 19:31.250
<b><i>Ten</i></b>

19:26.670 --> 19:29.620
<b>and considerably slow the effects of aging.</b>

19:30.510 --> 19:32.210
<b>Then comes <i>Zetsu</i>.</b>

19:31.250 --> 19:35.170
<b>Null</b>

19:31.250 --> 19:35.170
<b><i>Zetsu</i></b>

19:32.210 --> 19:34.710
<b>As you may guess, this nullifies your aura.</b>

19:35.590 --> 19:37.070
<b>It is effective for</b>

19:37.070 --> 19:40.450
<b>concealing your presence, 
and recovering from extreme fatigue.</b>

19:40.950 --> 19:43.140
<b>Which brings us to <i>Ren</i>.</b>

19:41.660 --> 19:45.080
<b>Enhance</b>

19:42.470 --> 19:44.200
<b><i>Ren</i></b>

19:43.670 --> 19:46.830
<b>A technique to create an especially strong aura.</b>

19:53.640 --> 19:54.840
<b>Can you feel that?</b>

19:54.840 --> 19:58.020
<b>Yeah, I can feel the pressure.</b>

19:58.020 --> 20:00.680
<b>But it doesn't feel dangerous.</b>

20:00.680 --> 20:03.690
<b>That's because I have no hostile intent.</b>

20:05.320 --> 20:10.300
<b><i>However, I must admit I am 
impressed by their senses.</i></b>

20:11.190 --> 20:13.910
<b><i>Perhaps it's because of 
how they've grown up.</i></b>

20:13.910 --> 20:17.710
<b><i>But their natural potential is 
also a major factor.</i></b>

20:19.050 --> 20:22.360
<b>Aura is an energy that comes 
from within humans.</b>

20:23.170 --> 20:26.500
<b>Which makes it very effective 
against other humans.</b>

20:27.150 --> 20:29.500
<b>For better or worse.</b>

20:29.890 --> 20:32.870
<b>If you attack a helpless person, with ill intent,</b>

20:34.160 --> 20:36.880
<b>you can use aura to kill.</b>

20:39.940 --> 20:41.840
<b>Only one thing can protect you</b>

20:41.840 --> 20:43.510
<b>from someone who uses <i>Nen</i>.</b>

20:44.060 --> 20:46.550
<b>You must also learn to use <i>Nen</i>.</b>

20:47.290 --> 20:49.130
<b>You must use <i>Ten</i> for defense.</b>

20:50.230 --> 20:53.270
<b>Block the other person's aura with your own.</b>

20:55.280 --> 20:56.490
<b>Otherwise...</b>

21:18.760 --> 21:22.050
<b>Your body will be crushed.</b>

21:26.070 --> 21:29.090
<b>Hisoka blocks the path leading 
beyond the 200th floor.</b>

21:30.260 --> 21:33.410
<b>Will Gon and Killua be able</b>

21:33.410 --> 21:35.690
<b>to learn enough about</b>

21:35.690 --> 21:38.810
<b>true <i>Nen </i>to pass Hisoka,</b>

21:38.810 --> 21:42.410
<b>and reach the receptionist, 
before the clock strikes midnight?</b>

21:47.630 --> 21:49.660
<b>It's too early.</b>

23:01.360 --> 23:02.870
<b>Coming up, we have Gon</b>

23:02.870 --> 23:03.710
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:03.710 --> 23:05.330
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:06.130 --> 23:06.490
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:06.130 --> 23:06.490
<b>Brush Your Teeth. 
Unripe Fruit</b>

23:06.590 --> 23:07.530
<b>It's Gon</b>

23:07.530 --> 23:08.390
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:08.390 --> 23:10.000
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:08.530 --> 23:18.580
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:10.000 --> 23:12.030
<b>Today, we introduce Wing-san!</b>

23:11.350 --> 23:14.200
<b>Master of Shingen-ryu. 
Zushi's teacher.</b>

23:12.030 --> 23:13.210
<b>He's Zushi's teacher!</b>

23:13.210 --> 23:15.000
<b>And a master of Shingen-ryu!</b>

23:14.200 --> 23:16.160
<b>Very serious about teaching <i>Nen</i>,</b>

23:15.000 --> 23:16.770
<b>Seems he's pretty good with <i>Nen</i>.</b>

23:16.160 --> 23:19.850
<b>but sloppy about everything else.</b>

23:16.770 --> 23:18.740
<b>Oh, Wing-san's shirt isn't tucked in.</b>

23:18.740 --> 23:19.870
<b>And his hair's a mess!</b>

23:26.240 --> 23:29.260
<b>Next time: Awakening x And x Potential!</b>

23:31.590 --> 23:32.720
<b>Did you feel anything?</b>

23:32.720 --> 23:34.400
<b>Nope, nothing.</b>
