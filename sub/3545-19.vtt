00:00.166 --> 00:02.083
<i>Previously, on </i>Desperate Housewives...

00:02.166 --> 00:04.291
- Grandma's here.
<i>- In life...</i>

00:04.375 --> 00:07.000
- A post-nuptial agreement.
- I'm not signing this.

00:08.458 --> 00:11.667
- Sign it.
- Stop. You're hurting me.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.542
Mrs. Solis. What are you doing?

00:13.625 --> 00:15.834
<i>...you can't change what's been done...</i>

00:15.917 --> 00:19.208
People leave trails.
One of those will lead to Deirdre.

00:19.291 --> 00:22.834
I'm not taking my money to the grave.
I'm gonna use it to save your ass.

00:22.917 --> 00:25.333
<i>...or who people really are.</i>

00:25.417 --> 00:28.917
Andrew just told me
he thinks he might be gay.

00:34.041 --> 00:37.166
<i>Every morning,</i>
<i>as she went to take out her trash,</i>

00:37.250 --> 00:41.208
<i>Lynette Scavo would indulge</i>
<i>in a little daydream,</i>

00:41.291 --> 00:45.834
<i>the details of which</i>
<i>were always the same.</i>

00:45.917 --> 00:49.542
<i>One day, her nasty neighbor</i>
<i>Karen McCluskey</i>

00:49.625 --> 00:52.875
<i>would keel over and die.</i>

00:52.959 --> 00:57.709
<i>And her home would be bought</i>
<i>by a lovely Swedish family</i>

00:57.792 --> 01:01.041
<i>with two adorable twin daughters.</i>

01:01.125 --> 01:04.917
<i>The families would form</i>
<i>an everlasting friendship,</i>

01:05.000 --> 01:08.667
<i>culminating in their daughters</i>
<i>marrying her sons</i>

01:08.750 --> 01:10.834
<i>at an elaborate wedding</i>

01:10.917 --> 01:14.291
<i>the Scavos wouldn't have to pay for.</i>

01:17.041 --> 01:20.750
<i>Yes, Lynette enjoyed</i>
<i>her little daydream.</i>

01:20.834 --> 01:24.083
<i>But Mrs. McCluskey</i>
<i>always had a way</i>

01:24.166 --> 01:27.208
<i>of pulling her back to reality.</i>

01:30.417 --> 01:32.417
Why are you
stealing my garbage cans?

01:32.500 --> 01:35.875
Garbage pick-up was two days ago,
they've been here ever since.

01:35.959 --> 01:39.250
- I assumed you didn't want them.
- That's very cute.

01:39.333 --> 01:42.417
That's great. Here, give 'em here.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.250
Bad enough that God-awful color
you painted the house.

01:45.333 --> 01:48.083
We shouldn't have to stare
at your cans for days on end.

01:48.166 --> 01:49.792
Good neighbor etiquette?

01:49.875 --> 01:53.625
How about you hire a gardener to take
care of that jungle you call a lawn?

01:53.709 --> 01:55.917
I am on a fixed income.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.917
Perhaps you should consider
somewhere less expensive.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.917
- Like a nursing home.
- Go to hell.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.333
Run by Germans.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.417
And, you know...

02:09.542 --> 02:11.667
Mrs. McCluskey.

02:11.750 --> 02:14.000
Mrs. McCluskey, are you all right?

02:15.667 --> 02:17.834
I'll get the door.

02:20.625 --> 02:21.667
Mrs. McCluskey.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.166
<i>For a brief moment,</i>

02:23.250 --> 02:26.917
<i>Lynette was presented with</i>
<i>an interesting choice of options.</i>

02:29.750 --> 02:32.500
<i>And though she knew</i>
<i>she'd hate herself in the morning,</i>

02:32.583 --> 02:35.667
<i>Lynette chose to do the right thing.</i>

02:35.750 --> 02:37.583
Lynette, where are they taking me?

02:37.667 --> 02:41.000
You're going to the hospital,
you're gonna be fine.

02:41.083 --> 02:44.458
I don't wanna go alone. Come with me.

02:44.542 --> 02:49.875
These are trained technicians
and I've got a roast in the freezer.

02:49.959 --> 02:52.542
Please. I'm scared.

02:55.625 --> 02:58.000
Yeah, I'll come with you.
OK, here I am.

02:58.083 --> 02:59.792
Thank you.

03:01.125 --> 03:04.166
If I die,
I don't want it to be with strangers.

03:04.250 --> 03:08.583
- You're not going to die.
- How can you be so sure?

03:09.583 --> 03:13.041
<i>Of course, Lynette didn't respond.</i>

03:13.125 --> 03:16.583
<i>How could she tell her neighbor</i>
<i>that some dreams</i>

03:16.667 --> 03:21.208
<i>are just too beautiful to come true?</i>

04:07.041 --> 04:09.917
<i>Life is a journey.</i>

04:10.000 --> 04:15.083
<i>One that is much better traveled</i>
<i>with a companion by our side.</i>

04:15.166 --> 04:19.417
<i>But sometimes,</i>
<i>we lose our companions along the way.</i>

04:19.500 --> 04:23.083
<i>And then the journey</i>
<i>becomes unbearable.</i>

04:24.166 --> 04:25.583
Noah.

04:26.875 --> 04:30.500
I didn't know you were a religious man.
What's with the rosary?

04:32.333 --> 04:33.625
They found Deirdre.

04:33.709 --> 04:35.083
What?

04:37.333 --> 04:40.083
Her body had been stuffed
inside a toy chest.

04:40.166 --> 04:43.417
Can you believe that?

04:43.500 --> 04:46.250
A kid's toy chest.

04:50.709 --> 04:53.709
She'd been dismembered.

04:59.583 --> 05:01.333
My God.

05:03.667 --> 05:06.959
Cops ID'd her from her dental records.

05:09.625 --> 05:12.583
She's been dead 15 years.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.166
All that time I was looking for her.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.917
She was already gone.

05:21.458 --> 05:24.041
I'm so sorry.

05:25.917 --> 05:29.125
I have to bury my baby.

05:29.208 --> 05:35.250
I came out here to figure out
what kind of tombstone to get her.

05:36.583 --> 05:38.458
You shouldn't be doing this now.

05:38.542 --> 05:40.667
Let's get you home.

05:41.959 --> 05:45.166
- There's a cop I want you to talk to.
- A cop?

05:45.250 --> 05:47.041
His name is Sullivan.

05:47.125 --> 05:50.792
I paid him to take the heat off you
for your neighbor's murder.

05:50.875 --> 05:53.542
He'll get you the file
on Deirdre's case.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.792
Apparently they have some leads.

06:04.583 --> 06:07.500
I don't know.
I think we may be making a huge mistake.

06:07.583 --> 06:09.959
We made our decision,
let's stick to it.

06:10.041 --> 06:12.333
Let's say we leave him here
three more weeks.

06:12.417 --> 06:15.041
What's the worst that could happen?

06:15.125 --> 06:18.166
Our son just told us
that he might be gay.

06:18.250 --> 06:21.667
There are 200 other boys in this camp.

06:21.750 --> 06:25.750
I could explain to you what might happen
if we left him here.

06:25.834 --> 06:28.583
But I am a lady
and I don't use that kind of language.

06:34.125 --> 06:37.667
I bet we're worrying over nothing.
This is probably just a phase.

06:37.750 --> 06:42.208
We'll get him into Christian counseling
so it won't become a lifestyle.

06:42.291 --> 06:46.208
Whatever's going on with him,
he's still our son and we love him.

06:46.291 --> 06:47.709
Why would you say that to me?

06:47.792 --> 06:52.083
It's obvious how freaked out you are
by the whole gay thing.

06:52.166 --> 06:55.291
I'm freaked out but that doesn't change
how I feel about him.

06:55.375 --> 06:57.583
I'm just saying, be cool.

07:01.834 --> 07:05.542
- I can be just as cool as you can.
- All right.

07:15.959 --> 07:18.792
It'll be nice to have you back.

07:18.875 --> 07:24.500
Andrew, I would love you
even if you were a murderer.

07:35.250 --> 07:37.417
Mommy, the line's not moving.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.709
For Pete's sake.

07:46.208 --> 07:47.625
Mom.

07:47.709 --> 07:49.166
Mom. The kids are waiting.

07:49.250 --> 07:53.750
Honey, Hector here
teaches salsa at the community center.

07:53.834 --> 07:57.959
- I give private lessons too.
- I bet you do.

07:58.041 --> 08:01.291
Mom, would you please not flirt
with the ice cream man?

08:01.375 --> 08:02.333
Why not?

08:02.417 --> 08:06.083
Do you need a reason beyond the fact
that he's the ice cream man?

08:06.166 --> 08:09.041
It's called moving on with your life.

08:09.125 --> 08:11.458
You broke up with Morty two weeks ago.

08:11.542 --> 08:14.000
At least pretend
to mourn the relationship.

08:14.083 --> 08:16.291
You are such a stick-in-the-mud.

08:16.375 --> 08:18.875
We should be out there having fun.

08:18.959 --> 08:21.041
I know what we can do tonight.

08:21.125 --> 08:24.834
We can go to some hip club
and get some hot guys.

08:24.917 --> 08:27.041
- Mom.
- It'll be great.

08:27.125 --> 08:31.417
I'll say I'm 42 and you can be 28.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.125
What?

08:34.125 --> 08:35.250
You can pull it off!

08:41.333 --> 08:44.041
Mrs. McCluskey,
you're back from hospital already?

08:44.125 --> 08:47.125
Turns out I OD'd
on my arthritis medication.

08:47.208 --> 08:51.250
One pill, I can open a jar. Four pills,
I'm face down, crawling for my life.

08:51.333 --> 08:53.458
You'll find out about that soon enough.

08:53.542 --> 08:57.625
Well, I'm glad to hear
you're all right.

08:57.709 --> 09:02.041
Here, my way of saying thank you for not
letting me die out there on the lawn.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.709
- Mrs. McCluskey, you don't...
- Keep that.

09:04.792 --> 09:07.417
It's genuine Tiffany.
Been in my family for years.

09:07.500 --> 09:12.458
I don't know what to say.
It's stunning, thank you.

09:26.542 --> 09:29.667
- I'd invite you in...
- I wanna tell you what my doctor said.

09:29.750 --> 09:32.000
Arthritis is the least of my problems.

09:32.083 --> 09:34.959
See, I had this skin tag,
or what I thought was a skin tag,

09:35.041 --> 09:36.834
but it might be more serious...

09:42.208 --> 09:43.792
What do you think you're doing?

09:43.875 --> 09:47.083
Please. I can't sleep in the den
any more. I need to sleep in a bed.

09:47.166 --> 09:50.917
You might wanna try a motel,
'cause you're not coming back in here.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.917
How many times
have I got to say I'm sorry?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.834
Obviously a few more.

09:58.834 --> 10:01.417
I'm not proud of what I did.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.375
I admit I was way out of line.

10:04.458 --> 10:07.792
You want back in this bed?
You know what to do.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.291
- I'm not tearing up the post-nup.
- Why not?

10:12.375 --> 10:16.333
Because it's the one way I can ensure
you'll be here when I get out of jail.

10:16.417 --> 10:19.542
Well, then, have fun at the motel.

10:19.625 --> 10:22.750
Fine. Tomorrow I'm canceling
your credit cards.

10:22.834 --> 10:24.291
What?

10:24.375 --> 10:26.834
And I'm taking away your ATM as well.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.792
What am I supposed to do for money?

10:28.875 --> 10:32.500
Once you see how good you've got it,
you'll treat me with respect.

10:32.583 --> 10:35.583
You want my respect?
Tear up the post-nup.

10:35.667 --> 10:37.500
Give me my pillow.

10:39.291 --> 10:40.291
One more thing.

10:40.375 --> 10:43.417
If you ever hurt me again,
I will kill you.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.542
If you ever leave me for another man,
I'll kill you.

10:50.959 --> 10:54.875
Boy, with all this passion,
isn't it a shame we're not having sex?

11:08.333 --> 11:10.000
I feel trapped.

11:10.083 --> 11:13.875
- Want me to open a window?
- No, I'm talking about my life.

11:15.917 --> 11:17.834
Are we done making out?

11:17.917 --> 11:20.166
No, no, keep going.

11:21.291 --> 11:22.792
So what's up?

11:22.875 --> 11:27.000
I'm unhappy.
With Carlos and my marriage...

11:27.083 --> 11:30.000
I feel like I don't have options,
it's driving me crazy.

11:30.083 --> 11:33.333
Every time something went south
in my life, I always had a plan B.

11:33.417 --> 11:36.166
- Now, I feel like I have nothing.
- What about me?

11:36.250 --> 11:39.500
- Can't I be your plan B?
- Damn it, John. What is our new rule?

11:39.583 --> 11:42.625
Stop pretending
we have a future.

11:42.709 --> 11:45.750
- Thank you.
- Can't you just walk out?

11:45.834 --> 11:49.291
No. If I leave,
I'll be broke and that's awful.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.041
If I stay, he's in control
and that's horrifying.

11:52.125 --> 11:53.875
And he cut up all my credit cards,

11:53.959 --> 11:56.959
which means I'm married to him
and unable to shop.

11:57.041 --> 12:00.083
Which is probably
the worst of all possible worlds.

12:00.166 --> 12:03.500
- I'm sorry.
- I'll figure something out.

12:05.250 --> 12:08.333
I'm not much fun today.
I'm gonna go.

12:11.083 --> 12:12.417
Wait.

12:15.625 --> 12:18.083
- What's this?
- You deserve nice things.

12:18.166 --> 12:21.125
And if Mr. Solis
won't provide them, I will.

12:22.750 --> 12:25.959
- With your student credit card?
- I own my own business.

12:26.041 --> 12:28.041
- You mow lawns.
- I make good money.

12:28.125 --> 12:31.583
I've 20 houses and I'm this close
to getting the country club.

12:31.667 --> 12:34.000
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

12:40.792 --> 12:42.583
I'll pay it off.

12:42.667 --> 12:46.125
If you want. But you don't have to.

12:46.208 --> 12:52.458
Mrs. Solis. To take care of you,
it's my dream.

12:52.542 --> 12:58.333
Well, far be it from me to stand
in the way of a young man's dream.

12:59.208 --> 13:03.542
OK, Tom, I will swing by the
dry-cleaners' after I hit the market.

13:03.625 --> 13:07.083
I don't know. Porter
has a dentist appointment at 4 pm.

13:07.166 --> 13:10.750
so the car might have to wait
until tomorrow.

13:10.834 --> 13:13.291
OK, yeah, I love you too.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.000
- Bye-bye.
- Hi, there.

13:15.083 --> 13:18.166
I brought you some avocados.
I've a tree but I hate 'em.

13:18.250 --> 13:21.417
Your family seems like
the kind that would eat guacamole.

13:22.041 --> 13:24.917
Mrs. McCluskey, thank you.
That is very nice.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.667
- So let's make up a batch.
- Now's not a good time.

13:28.750 --> 13:31.250
I'm on my way out,
I have a ton of errands.

13:31.333 --> 13:34.875
That's great, my car's on the fritz
and I could hitch a ride.

13:34.959 --> 13:37.667
- I need to drop by the pharmacy.
- No, I can't.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.333
I'm sorry, but I have
a lot of things to do.

13:40.417 --> 13:42.500
You could take me later or tomorrow.

13:42.583 --> 13:45.417
Mrs. McCluskey,
I'm not gonna have any time tomorrow.

13:47.083 --> 13:49.542
Interesting you can't
spend two minutes with me

13:49.625 --> 13:52.959
but you have no trouble
taking my Tiffany lamp.

13:53.083 --> 13:56.208
For God's sakes!

13:57.875 --> 14:01.250
Here. You should take this back.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.792
I don't have a place for it.

14:03.875 --> 14:06.125
That was my thank you
for saving my life.

14:06.208 --> 14:10.375
I know, and it was
a beautiful gesture, really.

14:10.458 --> 14:13.583
- But I just...
- Save it, Lynette.

14:13.667 --> 14:15.500
I get the picture.

14:29.208 --> 14:32.792
- God.
- Susie, this is Tim.

14:33.834 --> 14:35.417
Sorry if we startled you.

14:37.709 --> 14:39.458
That's OK.

14:39.542 --> 14:42.667
I just didn't expect to see anybody up
at a quarter to one.

14:42.750 --> 14:46.083
Susie,
you should have come out tonight.

14:46.166 --> 14:48.250
I met Tim here at the Islands bar

14:48.333 --> 14:51.792
and he introduced me
to this crazy drink.

14:51.875 --> 14:53.458
The Dirty Volcano.

14:55.291 --> 14:57.125
Then we danced.

14:57.917 --> 14:59.417
He dipped me.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.250
Sophie's very limber.

15:02.834 --> 15:06.375
Mom, could I just talk to you
in the family room for a minute?

15:06.458 --> 15:09.750
- Sure.
- Susan is your daughter?

15:11.166 --> 15:13.417
- Yup.
- No, she can't be.

15:13.500 --> 15:14.500
- Yes.
- No.

15:18.166 --> 15:19.583
OK, we get it.

15:19.667 --> 15:21.417
She looks young.

15:25.417 --> 15:27.333
That man has magic fingers.

15:27.417 --> 15:29.959
What are you doing?
I have a daughter.

15:30.041 --> 15:33.542
You can't bring men you meet in bars
here in the middle of the night.

15:33.625 --> 15:36.750
We're just having a few laughs.
What's the big deal?

15:36.834 --> 15:40.166
You're trying to get over Morty
but this is not the way to do it.

15:40.250 --> 15:42.208
Go out there and tell him to go home.

15:42.291 --> 15:46.625
You know how blue I've been.
Why can't you be supportive?

15:46.709 --> 15:50.083
- I've been plenty supportive.
- You haven't. You really haven't.

15:50.166 --> 15:54.125
Tim is my guest
and he will go home when I say so.

15:57.041 --> 15:59.417
If he's not gone in five minutes,

15:59.500 --> 16:02.542
I'm gonna go out there
and tell him how old you really are.

16:11.709 --> 16:16.417
Tim, it's time for me
to go sleepy-bye.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.792
Delfino.

16:27.792 --> 16:28.959
Yeah.

16:29.834 --> 16:31.166
You must be Sullivan.

16:33.542 --> 16:36.500
The file on Noah's daughter.

16:36.583 --> 16:39.125
Yeah, he said you had some leads.

16:39.208 --> 16:42.125
Yeah, sure, we got some leads.

16:43.250 --> 16:46.166
- Is there a problem?
- Gee, I don't know.

16:46.250 --> 16:51.041
I'm handing a confidential police report
over to a killer and drug-dealer.

16:51.125 --> 16:53.625
Why should that be a problem?

16:57.250 --> 16:58.834
Thanks.

16:59.625 --> 17:01.792
Is this what our justice
system has come to?

17:01.875 --> 17:06.166
Guys like you walking the streets
without a care in the world?

17:06.250 --> 17:10.000
- I did my time.
- Not enough, you piece of garbage.

17:14.166 --> 17:17.083
I'm glad we had the chance to meet.

17:18.166 --> 17:21.834
Because apparently I'm no longer
a murder suspect, thanks to you.

17:21.917 --> 17:24.083
I don't want to seem ungrateful,

17:24.166 --> 17:26.291
but just out of curiosity,

17:27.291 --> 17:31.333
how much does it cost to buy off
a homicide detective these days?

17:35.375 --> 17:37.375
Thanks again.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.208
Hey, Delfino. One more thing.

17:58.792 --> 18:02.625
Now this file was misplaced.

18:02.709 --> 18:04.750
Understand?

18:04.834 --> 18:08.917
If even a whisper of this
gets traced back to me,

18:09.000 --> 18:12.583
there will be one less
cop-killer on the street.

18:18.625 --> 18:22.917
And for God's sakes,
don't get any blood on the file.

18:44.208 --> 18:48.125
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but your credit card
has been declined.

18:48.208 --> 18:49.959
What?

18:50.041 --> 18:53.083
No, that's impossible.
It's a new card.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.917
I just went shopping with it.
Try it again.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.458
Ma'am, I ran it three times
and then I called the bank.

18:59.542 --> 19:02.291
May I try another card?

19:02.375 --> 19:05.250
Of course you may.
Will you just give me a moment?

19:13.792 --> 19:15.417
- Hello?
- It's me.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.667
I tried to call.
You turned your cell off.

19:17.750 --> 19:21.500
I'm in a lovely restaurant having
a lovely meal that I can't pay for.

19:21.583 --> 19:24.291
- Did you order already?
- I ate already.

19:24.375 --> 19:26.583
The credit card company
called my mom.

19:26.667 --> 19:29.166
They said there was
unusual activity on my card.

19:29.250 --> 19:31.333
- I bought shoes.
- I didn't know that.

19:31.417 --> 19:33.709
My mom started asking
all these questions

19:33.792 --> 19:36.500
so I blurted out it was stolen
and she canceled it.

19:36.583 --> 19:38.792
Why call your parents?
It's your account.

19:38.875 --> 19:41.542
They co-sign for it.

19:41.625 --> 19:45.000
<i>- If you explain to the waiter...</i>
- What?

19:45.083 --> 19:47.458
My card was canceled
by my lover's mommy?

19:47.542 --> 19:51.375
What other options do you have?
Return the shoes and get the money back?

19:51.458 --> 19:53.834
Return the shoes?

19:53.917 --> 19:56.458
I can't talk to you
when you're being hysterical.

19:58.500 --> 20:01.875
So, Ma'am, what would you like to do
about the bill?

20:15.208 --> 20:18.792
Afternoon, I've got a package
for your neighbor, Karen McCluskey.

20:18.875 --> 20:21.625
- Mind signing?
- Isn't she home?

20:21.709 --> 20:23.417
No one answered.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.750
All right.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.125
OK.

20:30.208 --> 20:31.583
Thank you.

20:42.083 --> 20:43.750
So let me get this straight.

20:43.834 --> 20:46.792
You play tennis, you know wine,

20:46.875 --> 20:48.667
and you speak Mandarin.

20:48.750 --> 20:51.750
Does every other man in the world
want you dead?

20:51.834 --> 20:54.375
I'm not that impressive.

20:54.458 --> 20:56.917
I pulled a grey hair
out of my chest this morning.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.917
I don't know,
I'd watch your back.

21:02.083 --> 21:04.542
You know, I've really enjoyed
talking to you.

21:04.625 --> 21:06.542
You...

21:07.500 --> 21:09.250
Well, you've made my day.

21:09.333 --> 21:12.875
I was thinking,
if you'd like to get together again...

21:14.625 --> 21:18.959
Well, Sam, to tell you the truth,
I'm kind of in a relationship right now.

21:19.041 --> 21:23.125
- I just wanted to be honest.
- That's perfectly OK, Tina.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.917
By the way, this is on me.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.667
- No, you shouldn't.
- Please.

21:30.750 --> 21:33.125
It's my pleasure.

21:39.792 --> 21:44.542
- This is gonna be a disaster.
- It'll be fine.

21:44.625 --> 21:47.709
Andrew. Honey, hurry up,
dinner's ready.

21:47.792 --> 21:50.125
It's like we're setting a trap for him.

21:50.208 --> 21:52.417
It's for his own good. You'll see.

21:54.417 --> 21:56.834
Smells good. What are we having?

21:56.917 --> 22:00.500
I'm making home-made bratwurst
with sweet and sour cabbage.

22:00.583 --> 22:03.583
It's a recipe I found
in an old German cookbook.

22:05.375 --> 22:08.542
I'll get the door.
Honey, why don't you pour the wine?

22:11.959 --> 22:15.875
- Isn't Danielle at Wendy's?
- I believe she is.

22:15.959 --> 22:19.500
Well, then, why did Mom
set the table for four places?

22:20.291 --> 22:22.709
I asked, who's coming for dinner?

22:24.250 --> 22:27.709
Andrew, you remember
Reverend Sikes, don't you?

22:27.792 --> 22:30.417
Come on.

22:30.500 --> 22:35.000
Reverend, why don't you have a seat
and I will get some refreshments.

22:39.083 --> 22:42.959
So, Andrew.
It's been a long time.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.333
Yes, it has.

22:46.417 --> 22:48.667
Would you like some water?
Flat or bubbly?

22:48.750 --> 22:50.458
Bubbly, please.

22:51.208 --> 22:52.625
So.

22:52.709 --> 22:54.375
Your mother tells me

22:54.458 --> 22:58.959
you've started having
some sexual desires for other boys.

23:03.875 --> 23:05.917
I don't suppose
I could get some of that?

23:06.000 --> 23:09.750
No. I'm gonna need every drop.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.625
And over the years, we've had so many
young people come to our ministry

23:15.709 --> 23:19.041
hating themselves
for their unnatural desires.

23:19.125 --> 23:22.333
In a few months, they've found
an inner peace and tranquility

23:22.417 --> 23:25.583
that is nothing short of miraculous.

23:25.667 --> 23:29.709
All it takes is a little faith
and a desire to change.

23:29.792 --> 23:33.792
I'm sorry, but I really don't want
to talk about my sex life.

23:34.792 --> 23:37.417
Well, that's too bad,
this needs to be discussed.

23:37.500 --> 23:40.917
Bree, please, let the boy speak.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.375
Go on.

23:42.458 --> 23:48.917
Well, I appreciate your offer to help,
I do. But I don't hate myself.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.041
So, I'm good.

23:51.125 --> 23:55.709
Son, I know what it's like to be
a teenager. It's a very confusing time.

23:55.792 --> 23:57.542
I'm not confused.

23:57.625 --> 24:00.959
I know exactly who I am.

24:05.959 --> 24:11.792
Well, if you ever do want to talk,
my door is always open.

24:17.375 --> 24:23.291
Reverend, I don't mean to criticize
but it sounds like you're giving up.

24:23.375 --> 24:26.709
We can't force him
on a path of righteousness.

24:26.792 --> 24:30.417
He himself has got to
want to make the journey.

24:30.500 --> 24:33.959
What do we do? Just stand by
while he starts dating boys?

24:34.041 --> 24:37.083
And by the way, the correct word
is not "gay", it's "sodomy".

24:37.166 --> 24:39.125
- We're in the middle of dinner.
- So?

24:39.208 --> 24:42.125
Can you wait till dessert
to call our son a sodomite?

24:42.208 --> 24:44.625
How you can be so casual
is beyond me.

24:44.709 --> 24:48.291
I knew this dinner was a bad idea
the moment you suggested it.

24:48.375 --> 24:51.959
- At least I'm trying to be proactive.
- Please, no need to get upset.

24:52.041 --> 24:55.500
I'm upset because there's a problem
no one seems to notice but me.

24:55.583 --> 24:58.625
As far as I'm concerned,
if Andrew is happy with who he is,

24:58.750 --> 25:01.250
it is our job to support him.

25:09.250 --> 25:12.667
- Your father is into S&M.
- Bree!

25:12.750 --> 25:15.166
He makes me beat him
with a riding crop. I let him.

25:15.250 --> 25:18.583
No wonder you're perverted.
Look who your parents are.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.125
Excuse me.

25:29.417 --> 25:31.250
What a fun night.

25:31.333 --> 25:34.750
You know, we should probably
do this again sometime.

25:46.417 --> 25:47.500
Hey.

25:47.917 --> 25:50.083
Hey, good news.

25:50.166 --> 25:52.917
I know why you've been
so furious at me.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.083
- I haven't been furious at you.
- Yes, you have. And I don't blame you.

25:57.166 --> 26:00.333
Men have been coming onto me
left and right.

26:00.417 --> 26:03.959
And I've been having so much fun
and just enjoying life.

26:04.041 --> 26:07.375
And what do I do?
I throw it right in your face.

26:07.458 --> 26:10.041
- I'd hate me too.
- Mom, I don't hate you.

26:10.125 --> 26:13.125
Well, be that as it may,

26:13.208 --> 26:16.000
from here on out,
I'm including you in all the fun.

26:16.083 --> 26:19.583
- The fun.
- Your mother's come through.

26:19.667 --> 26:21.875
What have you done?

26:21.959 --> 26:24.208
You and I are going
on a double date tonight.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.750
- What?
- Tim has a friend from the factory.

26:26.834 --> 26:30.583
I thought the four of us could hang out,
have drinks, hors d'oeuvres...

26:30.667 --> 26:32.500
- Forget it.
- Susie.

26:32.583 --> 26:35.875
Mom, I'm sorry, I'm just not
in the mood to hang out these days.

26:35.959 --> 26:39.000
Susie, sweetie, please.
I can't cancel now.

26:39.083 --> 26:42.542
Of course you can. Just call them up
and tell them not to come over.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.625
- Tim.
- Hi, Suz. This is my buddy, Lamont.

26:52.709 --> 26:55.500
I brought peppermint schnapps.

27:07.834 --> 27:09.792
I'm sure she's fine.

27:09.875 --> 27:13.166
She never leaves her mail
sitting out there.

27:13.250 --> 27:15.417
How many times
has she thrown ours away

27:15.500 --> 27:17.875
because we didn't pick it up
the second it came?

27:17.959 --> 27:19.333
That would be five.

27:19.417 --> 27:22.166
I don't know,
I think something's happened to her.

27:22.250 --> 27:23.917
OK, so go check on her.

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
But if I'm wrong, I'm sucked into a
two-hour conversation about bunions.

27:29.083 --> 27:31.083
- Don't go check.
- Six months from now,

27:31.166 --> 27:34.208
when they find her corpse
at the bottom of the stairs,

27:34.291 --> 27:37.166
what do I tell the kids?
"Yeah, I let Mrs. McCluskey die."

27:37.250 --> 27:38.959
Why would they care?

27:39.041 --> 27:43.000
Like they'll miss the dry-cleaning
coupons she hands out on Halloween.

27:43.083 --> 27:46.291
- Tom.
- Listen, honey, what can I say?

27:46.375 --> 27:49.500
You're damned if you do
and damned if you don't.

27:49.583 --> 27:52.208
I don't know. Good luck with that.

27:52.291 --> 27:54.583
Honey, I'm hating you
a little bit right now.

27:59.458 --> 28:01.667
Hi, honey. Look at my new shoes.

28:01.750 --> 28:04.542
- Yeah.
- Aren't they gorgeous?

28:04.625 --> 28:06.542
Honey, I'm trying to watch the game.

28:08.500 --> 28:10.417
Sorry.

28:15.125 --> 28:16.792
How'd you buy new shoes?

28:16.875 --> 28:19.667
Talk later,
you're watching the game.

28:19.750 --> 28:22.083
No, I wanna talk about it now.

28:22.166 --> 28:25.917
- You have no money, what's the story?
- You've heard it before.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.875
Girl meets boy, boy buys girl things,
girl leaves happy.

28:29.959 --> 28:31.083
What did you do?

28:31.166 --> 28:34.250
I forgot how generous men could be.

28:34.333 --> 28:37.250
I also forgot I have options.
A whole bunch of 'em.

28:37.333 --> 28:40.458
- What are you talking about?
- I don't need your credit cards.

28:40.542 --> 28:41.875
I don't need your money.

28:41.959 --> 28:45.417
But if our marriage is going to work,
I need your respect.

28:45.500 --> 28:48.667
- I'm not ripping up the post-nup.
- Yes, you are.

28:48.750 --> 28:53.375
Because if you don't, I'm gonna put on
my new shoes and walk out the door.

28:54.542 --> 28:57.917
- Are you threatening me?
- No, I'm just pointing something out.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.542
I'm a pretty girl.
And pretty girls are never lonely.

29:17.542 --> 29:21.750
Stop. I'm really ticklish.

29:21.834 --> 29:24.542
So children's books, right?

29:24.625 --> 29:26.083
That tickles.

29:26.166 --> 29:31.125
I hope you know how lucky you are. Not
everyone gets to realize their bliss.

29:31.208 --> 29:33.625
Yeah, it can be rewarding.

29:35.041 --> 29:37.625
Why don't you join me?

29:40.458 --> 29:41.583
No.

29:41.667 --> 29:43.750
I'm really ticklish.

29:44.834 --> 29:46.959
- Come on.
- What's wrong?

29:47.041 --> 29:50.667
For God's sakes, she's ticklish.
How many times do you have to be told?

29:52.166 --> 29:55.583
This is so much fun.
Let's find another CD.

29:55.667 --> 29:58.750
Mother, don't you think
it's getting a little late?

29:58.834 --> 30:00.625
Come on.

30:00.709 --> 30:03.458
You haven't even
finished your schnapps.

30:10.250 --> 30:13.333
The perfect capper
to the perfect evening.

30:13.417 --> 30:16.500
So, goodnight. It's been lovely.

30:16.583 --> 30:18.917
Lamont, good luck
with all your inventions.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.458
Well, it's only 11.30.

30:21.542 --> 30:23.792
I wanna hit the clubs.

30:23.875 --> 30:26.208
I know a great place
just off the interstate.

30:26.291 --> 30:29.583
- Warm up the old war wagon.
- Mom, hold it.

30:30.709 --> 30:34.500
You are not getting into the car alone
with those two. You barely know them.

30:34.583 --> 30:38.959
I have great instincts about people,
you know that.

30:39.041 --> 30:43.667
- You've been married four times.
- Yes, but twice to the same guy.

30:46.291 --> 30:49.667
- Mother...
- Susie, please, you're embarrassing me.

30:49.750 --> 30:53.542
- I'm embarrassing you?
- Yes. And I've had it.

30:53.625 --> 30:57.041
All night long, I've been trying
to get you to stop being so crabby.

30:57.125 --> 30:59.625
And you refuse to let me help.

31:00.333 --> 31:03.667
And your idea of helping
is letting Tim just grope you?

31:03.750 --> 31:07.458
Hey, you shouldn't talk to your mother
like that, she's a fine lady.

31:07.542 --> 31:11.166
- Tim, could you just stay out of it?
- Yeah, mind your own business.

31:11.250 --> 31:14.709
- What's your problem, pal?
- Dude, you were feelin' up her mother.

31:14.792 --> 31:19.041
It pissed me off, too.
C'mon, Susie, let's go back inside.

31:19.125 --> 31:24.291
Let's go back inside? Lamont,
give it up. You're not getting any.

31:26.250 --> 31:30.500
Why are you being this way?
I'm just trying to lighten things up.

31:30.583 --> 31:33.583
Stop acting like
tonight was about helping me.

31:33.667 --> 31:37.041
You wanted to go out and have fun
and Lamont there needed a date.

31:37.125 --> 31:39.500
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

31:41.417 --> 31:43.959
OK, fine. It's true.

31:44.041 --> 31:46.583
I wanted to get out and have fun.
Why shouldn't I?

31:46.667 --> 31:49.834
You know how depressed I've been
over my break-up with Morty.

31:49.917 --> 31:50.875
Yeah, I do.

31:50.959 --> 31:53.792
That's what makes me crazy,
the difference between us.

31:53.875 --> 31:57.500
You can be heartbroken
and you can just move on.

31:57.583 --> 32:02.083
And I am just broken.

32:06.500 --> 32:11.625
- I know you're sad.
- No, Mom, I'm not sad.

32:11.709 --> 32:14.458
And I'm not crabby.

32:14.542 --> 32:19.291
I'm devastated. And you keep acting
like all I need is a couple of aspirin.

32:19.375 --> 32:24.000
Morty was just one guy
in a series of guys for you.

32:24.083 --> 32:29.667
And Mike, he was the one.

32:30.583 --> 32:32.750
Why don't you get that?

32:40.458 --> 32:42.417
It's Lynette.

32:43.959 --> 32:45.542
Hello?

32:47.208 --> 32:48.875
Mrs. McCluskey?

32:51.834 --> 32:53.959
Mrs. McCluskey, are you all right?

32:54.041 --> 32:55.625
How did you get in here?

32:56.583 --> 32:58.875
Mr. Mullins had a spare.

33:00.625 --> 33:03.959
- Why didn't you open the door?
- I was hoping you'd go away.

33:06.208 --> 33:09.834
- Have you been taking your medication?
- I don't need to.

33:09.917 --> 33:14.000
- Sometimes the pain goes by itself.

33:14.083 --> 33:17.792
Is that why you didn't open the door,
because of your hands?

33:19.417 --> 33:23.166
Mrs. McCluskey, do you have
anyone that could help you out?

33:23.250 --> 33:25.792
A relative? A friend?

33:25.875 --> 33:27.375
I'm fine.

33:29.375 --> 33:30.917
OK.

33:34.250 --> 33:36.208
OK.

33:37.667 --> 33:38.667
Before you go...

33:38.750 --> 33:41.542
Open these, would you,
and put out the pills?

33:44.709 --> 33:47.834
- Yeah.
- Don't get your hands all over them.

33:47.917 --> 33:51.792
God knows what your kids pick up.
Last thing I need's a case of pink eye.

33:53.667 --> 33:56.333
You're a piece of work, you know that?

33:56.417 --> 33:59.166
This is crazy,
why do they give you child-proof caps?

33:59.250 --> 34:03.083
First thing tomorrow, I'll take you
to the pharmacy and get new bottles.

34:03.166 --> 34:05.667
Don't do me any favors.
You don't even like me.

34:05.750 --> 34:08.166
I don't want you to feel obligated.

34:08.250 --> 34:11.709
Let me tell you something.
Half of life is obligations.

34:11.792 --> 34:14.959
You don't wanna go to your husband's
company party but you do.

34:15.041 --> 34:18.959
You don't wanna sell candy so your kid's
band can buy piccolos, but you do.

34:19.041 --> 34:22.625
You attend your third cousin's wedding,
pick up the dry-cleaning.

34:22.709 --> 34:24.458
That's life, it's obligations.

34:25.375 --> 34:27.875
And you are now my obligation.

34:27.959 --> 34:30.250
So tomorrow morning,
we go to the pharmacy.

34:30.333 --> 34:33.667
Gee, I'm touched
by your outpouring of compassion.

34:33.750 --> 34:36.375
We don't have to be friends.

34:36.458 --> 34:40.792
But we're two human beings,
living on the same piece of earth.

34:40.875 --> 34:44.625
We can at least try and
help each other out once in a while.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.792
And you know what?

34:53.709 --> 34:56.750
I am going to take this.

34:56.834 --> 34:58.542
Fine.

34:58.625 --> 35:01.417
- I'll see you tomorrow morning.
- Pick me up at nine.

35:02.875 --> 35:04.625
And don't be late.

35:11.500 --> 35:14.417
Andrew, come here,
I want you to see this.

35:18.083 --> 35:19.750
What are you looking at?

35:19.834 --> 35:22.750
I'm looking at your baby pictures.

35:22.834 --> 35:24.667
Look at that one.

35:26.542 --> 35:30.667
- How old was I there?
- Just four weeks old.

35:38.625 --> 35:41.834
I never told you this, but when
I gave birth to you there were...

35:42.041 --> 35:43.917
...complications.

35:45.166 --> 35:49.709
The umbilical cord wrapped around
your neck and you stopped breathing.

35:49.792 --> 35:52.333
The room got very quiet.

35:52.417 --> 35:54.750
And I knew you were in trouble.

35:54.834 --> 35:57.583
So I turned to the doctor
and I very calmly said

35:57.667 --> 36:02.291
that he was not to worry about me,
that his job was to save your life.

36:02.375 --> 36:08.959
When I say I would die for you,
that's not an expression.

36:10.250 --> 36:12.500
I mean it.

36:12.583 --> 36:18.291
Yeah, well,
I'm gonna go eat my sandwich.

36:18.375 --> 36:22.041
Andrew, please,
just go and talk to Reverend Sikes.

36:22.125 --> 36:24.333
- For God's sakes.
- He can counsel you.

36:24.417 --> 36:27.166
- It can help.
- Mom, I don't need any help.

36:27.250 --> 36:31.375
All right? I'm fine.
Why do you keep going on about this?

36:31.458 --> 36:35.291
Because if you don't change who you are
then you won't go to heaven.

36:44.583 --> 36:47.083
You don't think I'll go to heaven?

36:47.166 --> 36:49.291
No, I don't.

36:50.333 --> 36:55.166
And I need you there.
I would be so lonely without you.

37:00.083 --> 37:05.041
Well, I guess I'd better
go talk to Reverend Sikes.

37:05.125 --> 37:07.542
Andrew.

37:07.625 --> 37:11.834
Thank you so much. You don't know
how much that means to me.

37:17.625 --> 37:18.875
My gosh.

37:18.959 --> 37:20.709
Are you OK?

37:20.792 --> 37:24.125
Yeah, I just fell down
the stairs. I'm fine.

37:24.208 --> 37:27.458
- What's up?
- Susan still loves you.

37:29.834 --> 37:32.500
Wow, OK.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.792
This is not a good time
for this conversation.

37:35.875 --> 37:38.583
She just misses you so much.

37:38.667 --> 37:42.250
I just found out that
someone I was very close to is dead.

37:42.333 --> 37:44.125
I've got to figure out what to do,

37:44.208 --> 37:47.333
so I just don't have time
to think about Susan right now.

37:47.417 --> 37:50.291
She's just very, very unhappy
and if you could just...

37:50.375 --> 37:52.750
I really don't.

37:52.834 --> 37:54.792
I'm sorry.

38:29.208 --> 38:35.125
I swear before Almighty God I won't
reveal a word that's said here today.

38:35.208 --> 38:38.291
Now, what's on your mind?

38:40.542 --> 38:44.125
Well, here's the thing.
I lied to my parents.

38:44.208 --> 38:47.291
- I'm not gay.
- You're not.

38:47.375 --> 38:48.875
Not really.

38:50.542 --> 38:53.834
All I know is, I wanted
to get the hell out of that camp.

38:53.917 --> 38:56.125
So, I lied to my parents.

38:56.208 --> 39:00.709
I told them I was really worried that
I was having feelings for other guys.

39:00.792 --> 39:03.333
They did exactly
what I wanted them to.

39:03.417 --> 39:08.208
- They're such tools.
- I'm sorry, just so I'm clear.

39:08.291 --> 39:10.667
Are you a heterosexual or aren't you?

39:10.750 --> 39:16.625
Look, I love vanilla ice cream, OK?

39:16.709 --> 39:21.458
But, every now and then, I'm probably
gonna be in the mood for chocolate.

39:21.542 --> 39:23.959
You know what I'm saying?

39:25.125 --> 39:29.875
I do. But God would prefer
you stick to the vanilla.

39:29.959 --> 39:32.709
I don't believe in God.

39:32.792 --> 39:34.917
- You don't?
- No.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.125
Sorry.

39:38.542 --> 39:40.542
Your mother's gonna be devastated.

39:40.625 --> 39:43.041
She's been praying so hard
for you to change.

39:43.125 --> 39:45.542
Well, that's the good news.

39:45.625 --> 39:48.083
I am gonna change. Big time.

39:48.166 --> 39:51.000
I'm not sure I follow.

39:53.750 --> 39:57.542
You know what my mom
said to me last night?

39:57.625 --> 40:01.041
She said she doesn't think
I'm going to heaven.

40:01.125 --> 40:03.709
Can you believe that?

40:03.792 --> 40:07.041
I'm sure she didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

40:07.125 --> 40:12.000
But the only way you can know paradise
is by repenting your sins.

40:15.083 --> 40:17.208
When she said that to me,

40:17.291 --> 40:20.291
it suddenly hit me
how I was gonna get back at her.

40:20.375 --> 40:25.125
From now on,
I'm going to be so good.

40:25.208 --> 40:28.667
I'm gonna eat my vegetables,
I'm gonna get good grades,

40:28.750 --> 40:30.709
say "Yes, ma'am"
and "No, ma'am."

40:30.792 --> 40:35.291
I'm gonna make her believe
that God has delivered her...

40:35.375 --> 40:38.208
...this little miracle.

40:38.291 --> 40:42.125
Until one day,
when she least expects it...

40:43.125 --> 40:48.542
...I'm gonna do something so awful,
it is going to rock her world.

40:48.625 --> 40:52.208
I mean, it is really
going to destroy her.

40:54.125 --> 40:56.291
And when that day comes,

40:57.291 --> 40:59.083
trust me,

40:59.166 --> 41:01.625
I'll know paradise.

41:13.709 --> 41:17.625
<i>Yes, life is a journey,</i>

41:17.709 --> 41:23.000
<i>one that is much better traveled</i>
<i>with a companion by our side.</i>

41:23.083 --> 41:26.917
<i>Of course, that companion</i>
<i>can be just about anyone.</i>

41:27.000 --> 41:28.667
Mrs. McCluskey.

41:29.667 --> 41:31.458
We're gonna be late for the doctor.

41:31.542 --> 41:33.959
<i>A neighbor</i>
<i>on the other side of the street...</i>

41:34.041 --> 41:37.125
I'm coming, Jeez! Hold your water.

41:39.875 --> 41:43.041
There you go. No more post-nup.

41:43.125 --> 41:46.625
<i>...or the man</i>
<i>on the other side of the bed.</i>

41:51.917 --> 41:55.750
<i>The companion can be</i>
<i>a mother with good intentions...</i>

41:55.834 --> 41:59.583
- Thank you for a wonderful service.
- Thank you so much, Bree.

41:59.667 --> 42:02.834
<i>...or a child who's up to no good.</i>

42:02.917 --> 42:05.667
Very inspirational.

42:09.875 --> 42:13.041
<i>Still, despite our best intentions,</i>

42:13.125 --> 42:18.458
<i>some of us will lose</i>
<i>our companions along the way.</i>

42:18.542 --> 42:23.291
<i>And then the journey</i>
<i>becomes unbearable.</i>

42:26.458 --> 42:32.166
<i>You see, human beings</i>
<i>are designed for many things.</i>

42:33.166 --> 42:37.667
<i>But loneliness isn't one of them.</i>
