WEBVTT

02:33.278 --> 02:36.114
And so it fell out that at Pharsalia...

02:36.198 --> 02:40.577
the great might and manhood of
Rome met in bloody civil war...

02:40.577 --> 02:44.790
and Caesar's legions destroyed
those of the great Pompey,

02:44.957 --> 02:48.585
so that now only Caesar
stood at the head of Rome.

02:48.752 --> 02:53.423
But there was no joy for
Caesar as in his other triumphs,

02:53.590 --> 02:58.762
for the dead which his legions
counted and buried and burned...

02:58.929 --> 03:00.889
were their own country men.

03:02.724 --> 03:06.478
The smoke of burning Roman
dead is just as black,

03:06.645 --> 03:10.107
and the stink no less.

03:10.232 --> 03:13.151
It was Pompey, not I, who wanted it so.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.862
Let what I have said be set down.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.992
You may stand.

03:23.704 --> 03:27.791
Do not try and impress me, please, by
looking either too penitent or too proud.

03:27.874 --> 03:31.670
As field officers, you
fought miserably for Pompey.

03:31.837 --> 03:35.132
Men under your command will be
permitted to enlist in my legion...

03:35.173 --> 03:37.634
and return to Rome as Romans.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.720
You shall have the same privilege.

03:39.803 --> 03:43.390
I'm not being magnanimous. Your
names are marked. You'll be watched.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.934
The first sign of treachery
or cowardice, you'll be killed.

03:46.143 --> 03:49.021
What is it, Flavius? Antony?

03:49.146 --> 03:52.524
Oh, yes. Canidius. With
news of Pompey, I hope.

04:27.184 --> 04:30.395
- Hail Caesar!
- Drink that in my name, Canidius.

04:30.562 --> 04:33.982
To all Marc Antony's cavalry,
Caesar's left wing and right arm.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.193
What news of Pompey?
Or what's left of him.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.279
Pompey's gone, Caesar.

04:39.363 --> 04:42.783
Slipped through our fingers,
disguised as a peddler, if you please.

04:42.950 --> 04:46.286
- Leaving most of his merchandise behind.
- Gone? Where?

04:46.370 --> 04:48.664
There's a report he has a
galley waiting at the coast.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.041
Provision for a long
voyage. Egypt, they say.

04:51.083 --> 04:56.213
Egypt. Possibly. They
owe him a great deal.

04:56.338 --> 05:00.300
He'll ask for sanctuary.
Borrow money, borrow time.

05:00.384 --> 05:04.096
I thought it was over. seems it's not.

05:04.179 --> 05:07.182
Rufio, consult the
augurers. I want to know.

05:07.266 --> 05:10.185
In Egypt, will Pompey face me at last?

05:12.396 --> 05:15.065
But surely, Caesar
will now return to Rome.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.150
I must go to Egypt in any case.

05:17.276 --> 05:20.445
Young King Ptolemy and his sister seem
to be having a civil war of their own,

05:20.570 --> 05:23.282
intent on destroying each
other, and in the process,

05:23.407 --> 05:26.868
- a great deal of wheat for Rome.
- That cannot be so urgent.

05:26.994 --> 05:30.163
Let the people of Rome welcome
great Caesar properly at last,

05:30.289 --> 05:32.541
in this greatest of his triumphs.

05:32.583 --> 05:36.712
Triumph? Over what?

05:36.878 --> 05:39.298
Over whom?

05:39.339 --> 05:41.466
- Canidius.
- Caesar?

05:41.592 --> 05:44.928
Leaving me the 10th and 12th, Antony
is to take the rest back to Rome.

05:45.137 --> 05:47.472
- When can he start?
- Whenever you say.

05:47.556 --> 05:49.474
Then at once.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.980
And in Rome, Marc Antony
is to speak for Caesar.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.940
There's to be no question about
his authority to act in my name.

05:57.065 --> 05:59.026
His word will be yours.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.986
And as always, Caesar's
word will be law.

06:01.069 --> 06:04.948
Of course. And remind him
to keep his legions intact.

06:04.990 --> 06:08.201
- They make the law legal.
- Caesar.

06:19.630 --> 06:23.675
Andevenas Caesar's galleys
sailed the great sea to Egypt,

06:23.800 --> 06:26.970
it was happening that,
just as the Romans,

06:27.095 --> 06:30.974
so the Egyptians made
war one upon the other,

06:31.016 --> 06:36.355
for young King Ptolemy would no longer
share the throne with his sister Cleopatra,

03:34.464 --> 03:37.634
Brutus, you'll turn Casca's
head with your flattery.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.149
but drove her from the
city of Alexandria...

06:39.191 --> 06:42.527
and sought to destroy her.

07:42.713 --> 07:44.715
We seemed to have arrived
on their market day.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.384
One day each week, they are
permitted into the royal enclosure.

07:47.551 --> 07:49.720
Market day or not, where's
the guard of honor for Caesar?

07:49.928 --> 07:52.556
Some representative, at
least, of the royal military.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.481
We shall now have the privilege
of watching mighty Caesar...

08:42.563 --> 08:44.691
battle his way through our marketplace.

08:46.109 --> 08:49.613
Marcellus, a dozen
front-rank men, swords only.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.782
I want a path cleared on a
direct line to the palace steps,

08:51.949 --> 08:54.576
- then as many more you need to keep it open.
- Marcellus?

08:54.785 --> 08:59.081
It's precisely what they hope we'd be
stupid enough to do: manhandle their people.

08:59.164 --> 09:02.626
No. This is their market day,
Rufio. We will go marketing.

09:02.793 --> 09:06.380
- You're not serious.
- We will shop our way to the palace steps.

09:06.463 --> 09:10.384
Have you my money? Everything
is to be paid for by coin.

09:10.509 --> 09:13.387
Tell the men to put away their swords
and carry their moneybags in hand.

09:36.535 --> 09:39.788
Olives. Oil of Olives.

09:39.871 --> 09:42.165
Ah! The wine of Samos!

09:42.332 --> 09:45.294
How much for your wine? Four drachma.

09:45.377 --> 09:47.504
Sixty of your wine for my men.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.631
Pay him.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.675
Pay him.

09:55.512 --> 09:58.140
You said the Romans were going to push
the people back and make them angry.

09:58.307 --> 10:01.184
Why aren't they doing
what you said they'd do?

10:01.351 --> 10:04.187
Your king has asked you a
question, Lord Chamberlain.

10:05.731 --> 10:09.192
The, uh, Romans have degenerated
minds, Most High Majesty.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.737
They, uh, do the unexpected.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.656
Particularly one Roman.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.200
Master of the unexpected.

10:17.326 --> 10:20.287
But with so few men.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.755
You all look so impressive.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.174
Any one of you could be king.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.134
His Divine Majesty, my Lord Ptolemy,

10:34.301 --> 10:36.929
lord of the upper regions
and of the lower regions,

10:37.012 --> 10:39.890
son of Ra, of Horus and
of Thoth, beloved of--

10:39.932 --> 10:42.392
Et cetera, et cetera. You welcome me.

10:42.517 --> 10:45.729
And I, Gaius Julius Caesar, consul
of the Roman Senate, Pontifex Maximus.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.357
Et cetera, et cetera. Thank you.

10:48.398 --> 10:51.777
From the Senate and the people
of Rome, Hail King Ptolemy.

10:51.860 --> 10:55.989
And, uh, his sister and
co-ruler, Queen Cleopatra.

10:56.114 --> 10:59.618
They won't tell you so,
but Cleopatra's dead.

10:59.743 --> 11:03.288
She tried to kill me, and then
we chased her off into the desert.

11:03.330 --> 11:08.919
- And there, she died.
- Whereas it is true that His Majesty's sister...

11:08.919 --> 11:11.296
repeatedly plotted to have him killed,

11:11.380 --> 11:13.715
it is not true that Cleopatra is dead.

11:13.757 --> 11:17.094
Whereas it is true that she,
uh, fled from Alexandria.

11:17.135 --> 11:19.054
I seem to be always interrupting you,

11:19.179 --> 11:22.140
but the search for
truth can go on and on.

11:22.266 --> 11:24.559
Pothinus, is it not
? Lord Chamberlain...

11:24.685 --> 11:27.479
and chief eunuch to King
Ptolemy-- an exalted rank...

11:27.604 --> 11:32.025
obtained not without certain,
shall we say, sacrifice.

11:32.109 --> 11:34.027
Theodotus, am I right?

11:34.111 --> 11:38.532
Tutor to His Majesty in history,
philosophy and, uh, ambition.

11:38.740 --> 11:41.410
And Achillas. They tell
me you're a good soldier.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.579
As one to another then,
where is Queen Cleopatra?

11:43.787 --> 11:47.583
- With her army.
- And how many of your men between her and Alexandria?

11:47.749 --> 11:51.461
- Enough.
- May I speak?

11:51.587 --> 11:53.755
Surely you have come here
in peace, mighty Caesar,

11:53.839 --> 11:58.427
nor do we present ourselves to you in
anything but warm and respectful welcome.

11:58.510 --> 12:02.639
Actually, our only problem being an
intern alone of concern only to us.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.683
Why have you come, Caesar?

12:04.725 --> 12:06.727
As we all know,

12:06.852 --> 12:09.396
when the father of both
Ptolemy and Cleopatra died,

12:09.521 --> 12:12.983
he named the two of them
to rule jointly over Egypt.

12:13.150 --> 12:17.571
Rome was appointed their guardian
and the executor of his will.

12:17.738 --> 12:21.783
I have come in the name of Rome to ask
why Queen Cleopatra has been deposed,

12:21.992 --> 12:25.287
to resolve the differences
between her and King Ptolemy...

12:25.329 --> 12:28.665
and to see that they peacefully
resume their joint ruler ship of Egypt.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.376
That will be difficult.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.378
Cleopatra has forfeited her right.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.881
I shall try to decide justly.

12:35.923 --> 12:39.468
Don't you see that he's going to send for
her? He's going to bring Cleopatra back.

12:39.551 --> 12:45.265
The sun which sheds its grace upon the ruler
of the two lands burns too brightly perhaps.

12:45.349 --> 12:47.351
If our Lord Ptolemy
wishes to retire--

12:47.517 --> 12:49.353
I wish nothing of the kind!

12:49.519 --> 12:52.481
I'm not going to be put out of the way
until I've watched you give him that!

12:55.525 --> 12:58.570
A thousand pardons, Divine
Majesty, I had almost forgotten.

12:58.737 --> 13:03.867
My Lord Ptolemy wishes to enhance his welcome
to Caesar by a gift of some importance.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.495
Most generous.

13:06.578 --> 13:09.581
The ring. Give him Pompey's ring.

13:21.510 --> 13:24.680
And now the token of His
Majesty's affection for Rome...

13:24.763 --> 13:27.891
and regard for Caesar.

13:40.195 --> 13:42.072
Pompey the Great.

13:46.118 --> 13:49.246
Dead men, they say, do not bite.

13:50.914 --> 13:55.085
Doe sit please you, Caesar? They
said it would please you very much.

13:58.797 --> 14:02.759
The sun does shed its
grace too brightly.

14:02.884 --> 14:06.138
It had become too hot here for kings.

14:06.221 --> 14:08.932
My Lord Ptolemy will retire.

14:24.907 --> 14:27.409
For His Majesty, a Roman guard of honor.

14:39.796 --> 14:42.674
It was not by your hand, of course.

14:42.799 --> 14:46.720
If, as you say, you've been told
of me, you know better, Caesar.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.808
My men are to be properly
housed and properly fed.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.311
- May I speak?
- Not until you're spoken to.

14:54.436 --> 14:56.355
For myself, I shall
require rooms in the palace.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.524
I shall consider myself honored,
personally, to escort you.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.069
Anyone but you.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.865
Find the rest of Pompey.

15:06.990 --> 15:09.952
Tear out a thousand
tongues, but find him.

15:09.993 --> 15:15.582
Have him purified, the coin in
the mouth and the rest honorably.

15:15.666 --> 15:17.584
Of course.

15:55.163 --> 15:57.416
For the time being, this
is what we must hold.

15:57.541 --> 15:59.918
The Moon Gate and three
others. Here, here and here.

16:00.085 --> 16:01.962
How are we placed?

16:02.087 --> 16:04.590
The 10th slingers on the Moon
Gate. The rest in reserve.

16:04.715 --> 16:07.926
The 12th holding all other
positions. Very thin, Caesar.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.095
For the time being, deep enough.

16:10.178 --> 16:13.098
- Have you tested the wells?
- The water's brackish, but it's fit to drink.

16:13.140 --> 16:16.560
So far. Keep an eye on them.
Watch the corn and wheat.

16:16.727 --> 16:19.396
Why, with our supplies secure,
we can hold indefinitely.

16:19.521 --> 16:24.276
For a week, perhaps, but for
the time being, time enough.

16:24.401 --> 16:26.361
What do you want?

16:31.909 --> 16:33.827
Is the man to be trusted?

16:35.412 --> 16:37.289
It seems that someone's
brought me a gift...

16:37.331 --> 16:39.583
from Queen Cleopatra.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.004
Apparently, a rug peddler.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.089
Flavius doubts it.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.091
He seems to know the
palace extremely well.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.177
He suddenly appeared in a
corridor through a secret passage,

16:50.260 --> 16:52.179
which none of the men knew about.

16:52.262 --> 16:56.141
I wouldn't put it past Pothinus to
send an assassin in Cleopatra's name.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.769
Have the man brought in.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.788
Are you the one who brings
a gift from Cleopatra?

17:17.954 --> 17:19.790
Then put it down and go.

17:19.957 --> 17:23.835
It is the command of my queen that I
deliver her gift personally to Caesar.

17:23.961 --> 17:26.463
I am Caesar. Lay it here before me.

17:26.588 --> 17:29.925
Forgive me, My Lord Admiral
Agrippa, but you're not Caesar.

17:30.008 --> 17:32.594
Nor you, General Rufio.
Nor you, Germanicus.

17:32.678 --> 17:37.683
My queen's gift is for the
eyes of Caesar... alone.

17:37.683 --> 17:39.893
- That rug seems harmless enough.
- No, Caesar!

17:39.935 --> 17:41.937
You can lend me your sword, Rufio.

17:42.145 --> 17:44.064
It may require some cutting.

17:53.323 --> 17:55.200
An odd way to carry a rug.

17:55.325 --> 17:58.161
Wouldn't it be easier to
sling it over your shoulder?

17:58.245 --> 18:00.664
It was less comfortable that way.

18:02.040 --> 18:05.002
- For you or the rug?
- That sword, Caesar.

18:05.127 --> 18:09.131
The rug is such a delicate
weave. If I may untie it for you.

18:09.214 --> 18:11.883
Turn it over first.

18:11.883 --> 18:16.138
- The rug is right-side-up. - I
understand, but I want it the wrong side up.

18:16.305 --> 18:19.182
- Or should I flip it over with my sword.
- No, no, no, no.

18:24.062 --> 18:28.400
I find one can tell more about
the quality of merchandise...

18:28.525 --> 18:31.445
by examining the, uh, back side first.

18:34.990 --> 18:38.869
All hail Cleopatra,
kindred of Horus and Ra,

18:39.077 --> 18:42.080
be loved of the moon and
sun, daughter to Isis,

18:42.205 --> 18:44.207
and of Upper and Lower Egypt,

18:44.333 --> 18:48.378
- queen.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.346
Thank you.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.389
Here.

19:02.225 --> 19:04.561
Take this to the captain
of the night watch.

19:04.603 --> 19:07.564
He'll see that the queen's quarters
are made ready and available to her.

19:08.774 --> 19:10.984
Stay where you are.

19:11.068 --> 19:14.571
- Have I dismissed you?
- No, Your Majesty.

19:14.655 --> 19:16.531
This is my palace, Caesar.

19:16.698 --> 19:19.743
All of it is, therefore,
available to me at my will.

19:19.868 --> 19:22.746
I am not your prisoner. If
anything, you are my guest.

19:22.871 --> 19:24.957
Most kind.

19:25.082 --> 19:28.919
And as for having my quarters,
as you put it, made ready,

19:29.086 --> 19:32.464
my chief handmaiden has, by now,
brought the others out of hiding.

19:32.589 --> 19:34.508
They should almost be finished.

19:34.591 --> 19:37.135
I'm afraid that's impossible. We've
had the doors under heavy guard.

19:37.261 --> 19:39.388
There are doors... and doors.

19:39.596 --> 19:42.140
Oh, yes, of course.

19:42.266 --> 19:45.769
You must take me on a tour someday
within the walls of your palace.

19:45.978 --> 19:47.771
What are you waiting for?

19:47.980 --> 19:51.191
- Permission to leave.
- Granted.

19:51.358 --> 19:54.069
Apollodorus.

19:54.152 --> 19:57.614
Thank you.

20:03.328 --> 20:06.999
Well, I'm pleased that you received
my summons after all and were able to--

20:07.124 --> 20:11.420
Summons? I'm pleased to say
I received nothing of the kind.

20:11.461 --> 20:14.381
I'm surprised that you
thought I would answer one.

20:14.464 --> 20:17.301
Young lady, the voyage in
your non-magic carpet...

20:17.384 --> 20:20.304
has apparently not tired you,
but I've had an exhausting day.

20:20.304 --> 20:23.807
Caesar, it is essential that
we understand each other.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.976
Only through me can
you hope to escape...

20:26.143 --> 20:29.938
from the desperate situation
in which you find yourself.

20:30.147 --> 20:32.149
I wouldn't bite into that if I were you.

20:32.274 --> 20:34.693
Did you bring it with you?

20:34.776 --> 20:36.737
Have you had it tasted?

20:36.778 --> 20:38.739
If neither, it's probably poisoned.

20:38.780 --> 20:42.326
Well, at least it's another way out of the
desperate situation in which I find myself.

20:45.704 --> 20:48.081
You're being tolerant
of me, aren't you?

20:50.375 --> 20:52.586
Is it because you're so much older?

20:54.087 --> 20:57.674
Your maps are inferior. Out
of date, compared to mine.

20:57.758 --> 21:00.344
They and I have aged together.

21:00.510 --> 21:03.347
The lakes to the west are poorly marked.

21:03.513 --> 21:06.016
Certain important hill
positions not even noted.

21:06.141 --> 21:10.187
I must arrange for you to address
my map makers and general staff.

21:13.190 --> 21:16.318
We've gotten off to a
bad start, haven't we?

21:16.401 --> 21:18.195
I've done nothing but
rub you the wrong way.

21:18.237 --> 21:22.741
I'm not sure I want to be
rubbed by you at all, young lady.

21:26.078 --> 21:28.288
It is permissible for
me to sit, is it not?

21:32.334 --> 21:34.211
Caesar, as quickly as possible,

21:34.336 --> 21:36.713
you must set me alone
on the throne of Egypt.

21:36.755 --> 21:38.715
My mission here is to put to an end...

21:38.882 --> 21:41.510
the tire some squabbling
between your brother and you.

21:41.593 --> 21:45.555
- You're not a fool. Or are you?
- Immodestly, perhaps, no.

21:45.722 --> 21:48.725
You've seen my brother
and listened to him?

21:48.934 --> 21:51.353
And that truly evil
man to whom he belongs?

21:51.478 --> 21:53.855
Yes.

21:53.981 --> 21:57.901
Shall we agree, you and I,
upon what Rome really wants,

21:58.026 --> 21:59.945
has always wanted of Egypt?

22:00.070 --> 22:04.700
Corn, grain, treasure.
It's the old story.

22:04.783 --> 22:07.995
Roman greatness built
upon Egyptian riches.

22:08.078 --> 22:11.915
You shall have them. You shall
have them allan din peace.

22:12.082 --> 22:17.129
But there is only one
way. My way. Make me queen.

22:17.296 --> 22:20.299
That sounds very much like an ultimatum.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.676
There is no other way.

22:22.759 --> 22:25.762
From one whose total assets,
up to a few moments ago,

22:25.762 --> 22:28.724
was a devoted slave
and a rolled-up carpet.

22:28.765 --> 22:30.892
But I have you now, Caesar.

22:30.976 --> 22:33.103
Besides, there are my armies...

22:33.186 --> 22:36.690
and the simple fact that no
mortal hand can destroy me.

22:36.732 --> 22:41.236
Ah, yes. I seem to recall some mention of
an obsession you have about your divinity.

22:42.279 --> 22:44.364
Isis, is it not?

22:46.700 --> 22:49.578
I shall have to insist
that you mind what you say.

22:49.703 --> 22:52.205
I am Isis.

22:52.331 --> 22:54.333
I am worshipped by
millions who believe it.

22:54.499 --> 22:57.336
You are not to confuse what I am...

22:57.377 --> 22:59.463
with the so-called divine origin...

22:59.546 --> 23:03.926
that every Roman general seems to
acquire together with his shield.

23:04.009 --> 23:09.890
It was Venus you chose to be
descended from, wasn't it?

23:09.932 --> 23:12.517
I must now do a little
insisting of my own.

23:12.684 --> 23:15.729
First, your journey has tired you
after all, and you wish to retire.

23:15.896 --> 23:18.982
I am not your servant,
Caesar. Do not dismiss me.

23:19.149 --> 23:21.318
Secondly, you have
no armies, young lady.

23:21.485 --> 23:24.488
Such as they were, they are gone
because you could not pay them.

23:24.529 --> 23:27.532
The riches of Egypt are not
available, even for your own use,

23:27.616 --> 23:29.534
much less to give away.

23:29.701 --> 23:31.578
Perhaps in a day or
two, we can speak again.

23:31.662 --> 23:34.581
That may be too late... for both of us.

23:34.665 --> 23:37.376
Your safety will be my responsibility.

23:37.501 --> 23:39.670
And what about your own?

23:39.795 --> 23:43.507
I am prepared, I believe,
for the time being.

23:43.590 --> 23:46.343
I hope so.

23:46.426 --> 23:49.763
I hope you are as wise, as brilliant,

23:49.888 --> 23:51.974
the god they say you are.

23:51.974 --> 23:55.894
You Roman generals
become divine so quickly.

23:55.978 --> 23:59.314
A few victories, a few massacres.

23:59.523 --> 24:02.526
Only yesterday, Pompey was a god.

24:02.693 --> 24:05.529
- They murdered him, didn't they?
- Yes.

24:05.612 --> 24:08.574
Because they thought
it would please you.

24:08.740 --> 24:12.536
- It didn't, did it?
- No.

24:12.578 --> 24:18.292
Today I found myself remembering
how much my daughter loved him.

24:18.333 --> 24:21.336
She died trying to bear him a son.

24:21.545 --> 24:23.338
Gave him this ring.

24:25.132 --> 24:28.385
Sleep well tonight, Caesar.

24:28.385 --> 24:30.679
These next days may
be difficult for you.

24:30.804 --> 24:33.724
Good night.

24:37.060 --> 24:40.397
Germanicus, a guard to escort
Queen Cleopatra to her apartments.

24:40.564 --> 24:42.399
Guards!

24:50.073 --> 24:52.409
Hup!

24:52.492 --> 24:55.746
The corridors are dark, gentlemen.

24:55.871 --> 24:59.124
- But you mustn't be afraid. I am with you.
- Hup!

25:11.345 --> 25:14.139
Don't you think we've covered about
everything we can tonight, sir?

25:14.222 --> 25:16.141
Perhaps a fresh start in the morning.

25:16.183 --> 25:18.226
No. There are a few more matters.

25:18.268 --> 25:21.396
One thing, Rufio. Has it occurred
to you that our maps of this area...

25:21.480 --> 25:23.815
are not quite what they should be?

25:23.941 --> 25:26.610
Why, no. What makes
you think they're not?

25:26.735 --> 25:29.029
I have an instinct about these things.

25:38.121 --> 25:39.957
Actually of Macedonian descent.

25:40.123 --> 25:42.584
No Egyptian blood.
Officially admitted, that is.

25:42.751 --> 25:45.963
Reputed to be extremely
intelligent and sharp of wit.

25:46.129 --> 25:47.965
Queen Cleopatra is widely read.

25:48.048 --> 25:51.134
Well-verse din the natural
sciences and mathematics.

25:51.134 --> 25:54.096
She speaks seven languages proficiently.

25:54.179 --> 25:57.724
Were she not a woman, one would
consider her to be an intellectual.

25:57.808 --> 26:01.228
And nothing bores me so
much as an intellectual.

26:01.270 --> 26:03.772
Makes a better admiral of you, Agrippa.

26:03.897 --> 26:07.317
Well, here's something perhaps
of more interest to the navy.

26:07.317 --> 26:12.531
''In obtaining her objectives, Cleopatra
has been known to employ torture, poison,

26:12.698 --> 26:16.743
and even her own sexual talents,
which are said to be considerable.

26:16.868 --> 26:21.873
Her lovers, I am told, are listed
more easily by number than by name.

26:21.999 --> 26:24.501
It is said that she chooses
in the manner of a man...

26:24.585 --> 26:26.837
rather than wait to be chosen
after womanly fashion.''

26:26.920 --> 26:30.507
Well, there's more
reason than we thought...

26:30.591 --> 26:32.509
for not wanting to leave you
alone, with her, eh, sir?

26:32.634 --> 26:35.679
I'm sorry, Rufio. I wasn't listening.

26:35.846 --> 26:38.098
You're not inclined to trust
this Cleopatra, are you?

26:38.140 --> 26:41.184
Trust? Not for a minute.

26:41.351 --> 26:45.897
Trust. The word has always
made me apprehensive.

26:45.897 --> 26:49.943
Like wine, whenever I've tried it,
the after effects have not been good.

26:50.110 --> 26:53.864
So I've given up wine and trusting.

26:53.947 --> 26:57.576
Oh, it's been along and
difficult day, gentlemen.

26:57.659 --> 27:01.204
The next few may be even
longer and more difficult.

27:01.246 --> 27:03.749
- Good night.
- Good night.

27:41.912 --> 27:43.747
Flavius!

27:45.707 --> 27:48.168
Flavius!

29:48.205 --> 29:51.416
It is autumn again,
my best-loved Lesbia.

29:51.541 --> 29:56.713
Look. The torrents of Roman
leaves are falling, falling.

29:56.880 --> 30:00.342
And lovers revive in kisses
the promise of spring,

30:00.384 --> 30:04.930
which will end the winter world
with new nightingales calling.

30:05.097 --> 30:07.391
I taste your food, daughter of Isis,

30:07.516 --> 30:11.395
and if there be harm in it,
let the harm fall upon me.

30:11.520 --> 30:14.064
But love must bring despair one day...

30:14.189 --> 30:16.733
as beauty, sorrow.

30:21.780 --> 30:23.907
Why do you stop, Phoebus?

30:24.074 --> 30:25.909
In the corridor, there is movement.

30:26.076 --> 30:29.538
That's how the Romans
frighten the enemy,

30:29.538 --> 30:31.415
by stamping their elephant feet.

30:31.540 --> 30:34.918
No. This is one man followed by others.

30:36.128 --> 30:39.172
- Caesar, I would say.
- Would you?

30:43.385 --> 30:45.929
We must not disappoint
the mighty Caesar.

30:46.013 --> 30:51.810
The Romans tell fabulous tales
of my bath and handmaidens...

30:51.977 --> 30:54.521
and my morals.

30:57.858 --> 30:59.776
Cleopatra has requested
an audience with me.

30:59.902 --> 31:03.155
- That was yesterday, Caesar.
- I've been occupied with important matters.

31:03.280 --> 31:05.782
The queen is, at present,
occupied with her bath.

31:05.908 --> 31:08.577
Perhaps Caesar could
return later or tomorrow.

31:08.785 --> 31:12.956
I'm afraid not. Hold
him. No, don't hurt him.

31:13.081 --> 31:14.958
You're a good man, Apollodorus.

31:15.083 --> 31:17.794
I hope you're appreciated.

31:17.961 --> 31:19.796
Wait here for me.

31:36.313 --> 31:39.149
Ah, then let us live and love...

31:39.274 --> 31:44.529
without one thought for the gossip
of virgin snow grown old and stale.

31:44.696 --> 31:46.740
Suns go down and may return,

31:46.782 --> 31:48.909
but once putout our own brief light,

31:48.992 --> 31:51.578
we sleep through one eternal night.

31:51.662 --> 31:55.165
An intruder! A man!

31:57.960 --> 31:59.878
Oh, it's you.

31:59.962 --> 32:03.966
You, uh, wanted to see me?

32:04.091 --> 32:07.010
I summoned you yesterday...

32:07.094 --> 32:09.638
to an audience in my throne room.

32:09.680 --> 32:12.516
I was told I was not
permitted to go there.

32:12.683 --> 32:14.685
For one thing, it's too
close to the quarters...

32:14.726 --> 32:17.187
occupied by your brother,
Pothinus, Theodotus and the rest.

32:17.354 --> 32:21.191
I will not be told where I
can go and where I cannot go!

32:21.358 --> 32:23.819
Since there's obviously
nothing that you want of me--

32:23.986 --> 32:27.573
Except my throne!

32:29.908 --> 32:32.619
At least you've dressed
properly for my presence.

32:32.744 --> 32:34.705
Your best armor?

32:34.788 --> 32:39.126
Almost, but I'm afraid it's
not being worn in your honor.

32:40.711 --> 32:43.797
I know. This morning, early,

32:43.880 --> 32:47.175
you paid a formal visit
to the tomb of Alexander.

32:47.301 --> 32:51.930
You remained alone beside
the sarcophagus for some time.

32:52.097 --> 32:53.974
I'd very much like to know how you know.

32:54.099 --> 32:57.728
Just staring down at him.

32:57.894 --> 33:01.398
And then you cried.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.483
Why did you cry, Caesar?

33:05.903 --> 33:08.780
That man recites
beautifully. Is he blind?

33:08.906 --> 33:11.408
- Don't you hurt him.
- I won't.

33:11.533 --> 33:13.535
Not anyone who speaks Catullus so well.

33:13.744 --> 33:17.414
Catullus doesn't approve of you.
Why haven't you had him killed?

33:17.581 --> 33:20.083
Because I approve of him.

33:20.125 --> 33:23.253
'' My desire to please
you, Caesar, is very slight.

33:23.337 --> 33:26.506
Nor do I greatly care to know
if you are black or white.''

33:26.590 --> 33:30.177
Achillas is moving his
entire army to Alexandria.

33:30.344 --> 33:34.556
By tonight, he'll outnumber
you 20 to 1, 30 to 1.

33:34.681 --> 33:37.601
He'll have the royal
enclosure entirely surrounded.

33:37.726 --> 33:40.687
Except to the sea.

33:40.687 --> 33:42.981
Do you plan to sail away, great Caesar?

33:43.106 --> 33:45.317
Not for the time being.

33:45.525 --> 33:50.948
Achillas may attack tomorrow, the
next day, whenever it suits him!

33:51.114 --> 33:54.952
- Very probable.
- In your wildest dreams, Caesar,

33:54.993 --> 33:59.957
how can you possibly hope to hold the
gates of this enclosure against such odds?

34:00.082 --> 34:02.584
And if you say once more,
'' For the time being--''

34:02.584 --> 34:08.172
My officers say anything from a week to
indefinitely. What would you estimate?

34:10.217 --> 34:12.302
Before you're without water,

34:12.386 --> 34:15.389
without food, your troops slaughtered,

34:15.472 --> 34:18.725
picked off from the rooftops,
poisoned in the brothels?

34:18.891 --> 34:23.730
A few days, Caesar. At
the most, a few days.

34:23.897 --> 34:27.775
I'm inclined to agree with you.

34:27.943 --> 34:30.487
Young man, do you
know this of Catullus?

34:30.612 --> 34:33.489
''Give me a thousand
and a thousand kisses.

34:33.574 --> 34:35.492
When we have many thousand more,

34:35.576 --> 34:38.078
we will scramble them
and forget the score,

34:38.161 --> 34:41.665
so evil envy will not
know how high the count...

34:41.790 --> 34:44.585
and cast its evil eye.''

34:48.672 --> 34:51.466
It couldn't possibly have been
as pleasant in the throne room.

34:55.387 --> 34:59.891
- '' My desire to please you, Caesar,
is very slight--'' - Be still!

34:59.975 --> 35:03.186
Caesar, a word. It's important.

35:05.606 --> 35:07.524
The Egyptian war galleys
in the eastern harbor,

35:07.566 --> 35:09.568
they've been taking on
men and armaments all day.

35:09.651 --> 35:11.570
When will they be prepared
to move against us?

35:11.653 --> 35:14.615
Tomorrow with the morning wind.

35:14.740 --> 35:16.575
Burn them tonight.

35:16.700 --> 35:18.827
Their ships lie close
to shore, tightly packed.

35:18.869 --> 35:20.954
There's a chance the fire
may spread to the city.

35:21.079 --> 35:23.707
Let's hope it doesn't.
I can't risk a blockade,

35:23.832 --> 35:25.709
And remember, not before tonight.

35:25.876 --> 35:29.880
Prepare as secretly as
possible. I need this day.

35:29.922 --> 35:31.798
Good luck.

35:35.135 --> 35:38.513
Why not before tonight, my lord?
Why does Caesar need this day?

35:38.680 --> 35:42.100
I can't give you that
information... for the time being.

35:50.359 --> 35:52.319
Flavius.

35:52.402 --> 35:55.197
Here it is, Caesar. Just arrived.

35:55.322 --> 35:57.824
The gods shouldn't
tantalize us so, Rufio.

36:00.535 --> 36:03.288
It's even better than I'd hoped.

36:03.330 --> 36:05.540
You'd best be on your
way. You haven't much time.

36:05.666 --> 36:07.584
Hail Caesar.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.566
It is called an epilepse...

36:30.691 --> 36:35.737
because of the arching caused by
the muscular spasms, the contortions.

36:35.946 --> 36:38.365
The Greeks of early times considered
those who suffered from it...

36:38.490 --> 36:40.534
to be favored by the gods.

36:40.576 --> 36:46.123
The great Alexander, they
say, had this falling sickness.

36:46.290 --> 36:50.127
And, so they say, the mighty Caesar too.

36:52.004 --> 36:54.673
Your Majesty, forgive me.
Sosigenus, the library.

36:54.798 --> 36:56.842
- What are you talking about?
- The Romans.

36:56.967 --> 36:59.136
They've set fire to the Egyptian fleet.

36:59.136 --> 37:01.179
- It's about time.
- Come see for yourself.

37:01.263 --> 37:03.307
The fire's spread to the city.

37:03.390 --> 37:06.143
- The city!
- Not a great area, just a few buildings.

37:06.226 --> 37:08.145
But the library is burning.

37:12.357 --> 37:14.693
The great library!

37:29.458 --> 37:32.502
Aristotle's manuscripts.

37:35.005 --> 37:38.967
The Platonic commentaries,
the plays, the histories.

37:39.051 --> 37:41.511
The testament of the Hebrewgod.

37:41.595 --> 37:44.765
The Book of Books.

37:49.186 --> 37:51.355
The wind blew these burning galleys
right into the merchant shipping.

37:51.480 --> 37:53.690
At least four or five
burned and sank right here.

37:53.899 --> 37:57.194
- And our own ships?
- Safe and dry. There's a problem about prisoners.

37:57.277 --> 37:59.780
- They're surrendering in droves. I need help.
- Not one man.

37:59.863 --> 38:02.366
- I may even want your sailors before long.
- Halt!

38:02.491 --> 38:06.495
Take your hands off me!

38:12.584 --> 38:14.920
You should attack my guards more often.

38:15.087 --> 38:17.339
Battle seems to be come you.

38:17.339 --> 38:19.549
You grow more beautiful
each time I see you.

38:21.093 --> 38:22.970
And you grow bolder.

38:23.095 --> 38:25.097
And busier.

38:25.180 --> 38:28.558
- Actually, we're extremely busy at
this moment-- - Do you smell smoke?

38:30.519 --> 38:33.188
We found it necessary to
burn the Egyptian fleet.

38:33.355 --> 38:35.232
When last seen, the
ships were in the water.

38:35.315 --> 38:38.527
Did you find it necessary to
burn them in the city streets?

38:38.569 --> 38:40.571
Some merchant ships caught fire.

38:40.612 --> 38:42.990
The burning masts fell into
the streets. Some houses--

38:42.990 --> 38:46.577
One of them: the great
library of Alexandria.

38:46.702 --> 38:49.538
Yes, I've been told.
I'm extremely sorry.

38:49.705 --> 38:52.708
- Now, if you don't mind, I
must ask you to-- - I do mind.

38:52.791 --> 38:54.918
Are you putting the fire out?

38:55.085 --> 38:57.588
We're trying to form Egyptian
prisoners into fire brigades.

38:57.713 --> 39:01.675
Oh, I see. Romans only
start fires, is that it?

39:01.758 --> 39:04.928
Have you broken out of your nursery,
young lady, to come irritate the adults?

39:05.012 --> 39:06.930
Some other time. We have work to do.

39:07.014 --> 39:08.932
Shall we remove her for you, Caesar?

39:09.141 --> 39:12.102
Use that Roman genius for destruction.

39:12.185 --> 39:15.105
Tear down pyramids, wipe out cities!

39:15.188 --> 39:20.777
How dare you and the rest of your
barbarians set fire to my library?

39:20.903 --> 39:24.114
Play conqueror all you
want, mighty Caesar.

39:24.281 --> 39:28.577
Rape, murder, pillage thousands,
millions of human beings.

39:28.702 --> 39:32.122
But neither you nor
any other barbarian...

39:32.289 --> 39:35.334
has the right to destroy
one human thought!

39:35.375 --> 39:39.338
That's enough! Leave me alone with her.

39:42.341 --> 39:44.968
I will send for you when I
finish. It will not be long.

39:50.140 --> 39:52.935
Swords? Javelins?

39:52.935 --> 39:55.479
Or are you going to set me on fire?

39:55.604 --> 39:58.690
The time has come, I think,
for us to understand each other.

39:58.774 --> 40:02.694
Whatever else I may be, in your
opinion, first of all, I am Caesar.

40:02.736 --> 40:05.697
And I am Cleopatra,
queen, daughter of Isis!

40:05.781 --> 40:08.200
If I say so and when I say so,

40:08.325 --> 40:12.079
you are what I say
you are, nothing more.

40:12.162 --> 40:14.539
Hail Caesar!

40:16.375 --> 40:21.880
You, a descendant of generations of
inbred, incestuous mental defectives,

40:22.005 --> 40:24.925
- how dare you call anyone barbarian.
- Barbarian!

40:25.008 --> 40:28.136
Daughter of an idiotic flute-playing
drunkard who bribed his way to the throne.

40:28.220 --> 40:30.138
Your price was too high, remember?

40:30.180 --> 40:33.141
I've had my fill with the smug
condescension of you worn-out pretenders,

40:33.183 --> 40:35.143
parading on the ruins
of your past glories.

40:35.185 --> 40:38.480
- The future concerns me.
- Then keep out of my affairs and do as I say.

40:38.564 --> 40:41.900
Do as you say? Literally?

40:41.984 --> 40:44.319
As if I were something
you had conquered?

40:44.486 --> 40:47.322
If I choose to regard you as such.

40:47.447 --> 40:49.866
Am I to understand then...

40:49.908 --> 40:52.494
that you feel free to do
with me whatever you want,

40:52.619 --> 40:54.538
whenever you want?

40:54.705 --> 40:57.541
Yes, I want that understood.

41:02.296 --> 41:04.881
Won't you at least wear
your laurel wreath...

41:04.965 --> 41:09.386
so I can be reminded it's the
divine Caesar that honors me so?

41:09.511 --> 41:11.972
You talk too much.

41:14.099 --> 41:18.937
I promise you... you
won't like me this way.

41:20.981 --> 41:23.609
Caesar! An attack on the Moon Gate!

41:24.776 --> 41:26.778
The Moon Gate. An attack in force!

42:34.638 --> 42:36.598
Those ballistas need eliminating.

42:36.682 --> 42:38.684
Send out a turtle.

42:41.687 --> 42:44.398
Form the turtle!

44:00.307 --> 44:02.184
Now is the time for us to attack!

44:02.309 --> 44:04.770
- No.
- We have a full legion in reserve.

44:04.937 --> 44:06.772
We hold our positions here.

44:19.409 --> 44:22.454
Two hours till dawn.
We'll hold where we are.

44:22.537 --> 44:25.415
- And what happens at dawn?
- I thought you knew.

44:25.540 --> 44:27.542
The sun comes up.

45:00.075 --> 45:01.952
Tell the men they've won their fight.

45:02.119 --> 45:04.580
Immediate liberty and plenty of
wine for those who defended the gate.

45:04.705 --> 45:06.540
All reserves, the cavalry,
every fresh man available,

45:06.748 --> 45:08.625
have them move out behind Achillas.

45:08.709 --> 45:12.129
- We have him in a vise.
- What is the other half of this vise?

45:12.170 --> 45:14.381
Rufio and the armies of Mithradates.

45:14.464 --> 45:16.717
- He left last night to meet them.
- Mithradates?

45:16.800 --> 45:18.677
How could he get here this fast?

45:18.802 --> 45:20.804
I started him when
we set sail for Egypt.

45:20.804 --> 45:22.889
After all, no general
in his right mind...

45:22.973 --> 45:25.684
could hope to hold
Alexandria with two legions,

45:25.809 --> 45:29.187
as you and others have
repeatedly pointed out to me.

45:53.420 --> 45:55.964
I taste your drink, daughter of Isis,

45:56.048 --> 45:59.801
and if there be harm in it,
let the harm fall upon me.

46:04.973 --> 46:06.934
Lotus.

46:08.685 --> 46:11.730
You wiped the rim of the
cup after you tasted it.

46:11.897 --> 46:14.900
- Why?
- Why?

46:14.983 --> 46:17.527
Why, so my mouth would not soil it.

46:17.527 --> 46:22.032
Lotus, taste it again.

46:30.916 --> 46:32.876
Pothinus said he would have me killed.

46:32.918 --> 46:35.420
Forgive me, Majesty.

46:35.545 --> 46:38.674
Forgive me. Forgive me.

46:38.799 --> 46:40.717
I forgive you.

46:43.679 --> 46:45.681
Now drink it.

47:12.916 --> 47:14.918
Apollodorus!

47:17.588 --> 47:19.548
Apollodorus!

47:25.137 --> 47:27.598
Great silence for Gaius Julius Caesar,

47:27.723 --> 47:30.058
consul of the Senate
of the people of Rome.

47:30.183 --> 47:32.269
You will all stand.

47:55.792 --> 47:58.337
Let what is said be recorded...

47:58.378 --> 48:01.590
as the judgment and decree of
the Senate and people of Rome.

48:03.800 --> 48:05.677
There is no judgment here.

48:05.802 --> 48:08.430
And the decree not
Rome's, but Cleopatra's.

48:08.513 --> 48:10.682
She has lied to you, Caesar.

48:10.807 --> 48:12.935
She and her slaves lie to you.

48:13.060 --> 48:15.020
You have not been accused, Pothinus,

48:15.145 --> 48:17.105
thus far.

48:17.189 --> 48:22.110
You are now charged with inciting and
abetting war against the Roman army.

48:22.152 --> 48:25.530
You are now charged with plotting
to assassinate Queen Cleopatra.

48:25.614 --> 48:27.532
You are guilty of both.

48:27.699 --> 48:30.577
- You are sentenced to death.

48:49.346 --> 48:52.474
It's too bright in here.
Shut out some of the sun.

49:06.738 --> 49:10.492
Are you going to kill me too,
Caesar? What am I accused of?

49:10.576 --> 49:13.078
King Ptolemy is hereby removed...

49:13.161 --> 49:15.664
from the protective custody of Rome.

49:15.789 --> 49:17.833
He will leave the
palace within the hour...

49:17.958 --> 49:21.086
and be conducted safely to
the camp of General Achillas.

49:21.211 --> 49:24.673
Achillas? You're going to
send me back to my own troops?

49:24.756 --> 49:29.094
He is to be accompanied by
his learned tutor, Theodotus.

49:29.177 --> 49:32.347
Do you hear that? You're
going to be saved along with me.

49:32.389 --> 49:34.725
Stop grining, you little idiot.

49:34.766 --> 49:39.771
May I speak? You know
that Achillas is trapped...

49:39.980 --> 49:43.233
between your own legions and
the armies of Mithradates.

49:43.275 --> 49:46.904
You know that to send His Majesty to
fight against them may mean his death.

49:47.029 --> 49:49.531
An occupational hazard for
those who would be king.

49:49.615 --> 49:51.909
But then certainly not I, Caesar.

49:52.075 --> 49:54.369
I'm no king, nor general.
What do I know of war?

49:54.494 --> 49:56.580
A simple scholar.

49:56.747 --> 49:59.124
A man of thoughts and words.

49:59.207 --> 50:02.586
Too many words. Enough.

50:02.753 --> 50:04.671
Let all be done properly as decreed.

50:29.279 --> 50:31.156
Flavius.

50:32.950 --> 50:35.577
Find Apollodorus.
Return his dagger to him.

50:35.744 --> 50:38.622
You might clean it first.
It has Pothinus all over it.

50:40.499 --> 50:43.418
Yes, yes, I know I'm
tired. I promise I'll sleep.

50:45.587 --> 50:50.676
You have my apologies for
what almost happened to you.

50:50.676 --> 50:55.222
Caesar, will you talk
with me for just a minute?

50:55.305 --> 50:57.683
Yesterday was full.
Tonight was rather long.

50:57.724 --> 50:59.768
This morning has not been uneventful.

50:59.893 --> 51:03.146
Did you know that Apollodorus
would kill Pothinus?

51:03.272 --> 51:07.401
He was kind enough to wait until
Rome had passed sentence of death.

51:07.526 --> 51:11.780
And my brother... and Theodotus?

51:11.989 --> 51:14.116
They, too, will be killed, possibly.

51:14.199 --> 51:16.451
Probably.

51:16.577 --> 51:18.537
Your Majesty, I'm truly
weary. If you'll forgive me.

51:18.745 --> 51:23.166
You knew all along, didn't you,
that there was no real danger,

51:23.292 --> 51:26.044
that Mithradates was on
his way to reinforce you.

51:26.169 --> 51:28.130
Why didn't you tell me?

51:28.171 --> 51:30.090
I said I was prepared.
You wouldn't believe me.

51:30.132 --> 51:33.677
- I don't want to be rude, but I really
must insist-- - I would've believed you.

51:33.719 --> 51:36.138
- You didn't trust me, is that it?
- Not for an instant.

51:36.305 --> 51:39.308
And yet... in these last few minutes,

51:39.391 --> 51:42.269
you have made me undisputed queen.

51:42.352 --> 51:44.938
The sole ruler of Egypt. Why?

51:45.147 --> 51:48.108
Perhaps-- Perhaps tomorrow
later in the day we could talk.

51:48.191 --> 51:50.444
- Why, Caesar?
- It was best for Rome. Please!

51:50.569 --> 51:52.905
- Best for Egypt.
- For Egypt too.

51:52.988 --> 51:55.616
Cleopatra, get out.
I beg of you, get out.

52:21.141 --> 52:23.727
That will not be needed.

52:23.936 --> 52:27.397
It wasn't necessary
for me to betray myself.

52:27.564 --> 52:29.524
I could have called out for Flavius.

52:29.566 --> 52:32.611
How many new spy-holes
have you dug in the walls?

52:32.778 --> 52:34.780
Are we being watched even now?

52:36.406 --> 52:38.742
If you see Flavius, you
might send him to me.

52:40.327 --> 52:43.372
- Still trying to dismiss me?
- What is it you want?

52:43.497 --> 52:47.292
- What more do you want?
- To be of help to you.

52:47.376 --> 52:50.379
There never has been
help. There never will be.

52:54.591 --> 52:57.678
Now there is.

52:57.761 --> 53:00.264
One day it'll happen
where I cannot hide,

53:00.389 --> 53:03.058
where the world will see me fall.

53:03.100 --> 53:05.811
I shall tumble down before the mob...

53:05.978 --> 53:08.772
and foam at the mouth
and make them laugh,

53:08.981 --> 53:11.149
and they'll tear me to pieces.

53:11.275 --> 53:14.278
The gods themselves had your sickness.

53:14.319 --> 53:18.282
Hannibal, even the great Alexander.

53:18.323 --> 53:20.576
And in the end, they fell.

53:20.701 --> 53:23.120
Were torn to pieces by the mob.

53:24.580 --> 53:26.873
Not you.

53:27.124 --> 53:29.126
I will see to that.

53:46.101 --> 53:51.356
In the name of the Senate and the
people of Rome and by their will.

54:22.304 --> 54:24.556
Isis herself would surrender
her place in heaven...

54:24.681 --> 54:26.934
to be as beautiful as you.

54:26.975 --> 54:30.979
You're not supposed to
look at me. No one is.

54:31.188 --> 54:33.690
Well, if they aren't looking,
how do they know that I am?

54:35.192 --> 54:37.194
You should be kneeling.

54:37.277 --> 54:41.365
That, too, before all
these visiting kings,

54:41.448 --> 54:44.701
making believe that
they're not watching us?

54:48.705 --> 54:52.542
You have such bony knees.

54:52.709 --> 54:57.130
Not only bony, but unaccustomed
to this sort of thing.

55:44.177 --> 55:46.179
If we're to get an early
start in the morning--

55:46.430 --> 55:48.807
What will it be tomorrow?

55:48.932 --> 55:51.435
More wheat? What I've seen already...

55:51.476 --> 55:54.062
could feed more legions
than Rome has ever had.

55:54.187 --> 55:56.106
There is enough to feed the world.

55:56.231 --> 55:58.150
More gold then.

55:58.275 --> 56:00.736
Why not buy the world?
Surely, you must have enough.

56:00.903 --> 56:05.282
At least enough to pay more
legions than even Rome has ever had.

56:05.365 --> 56:07.618
More granite, more marble,

56:07.701 --> 56:11.496
more millions of slaves to
build whatever needs building.

56:11.580 --> 56:14.499
Better routes to India,
shorter routes to the East.

56:14.541 --> 56:16.460
What can it be in Egypt
that I haven't seen?

56:16.627 --> 56:20.672
Egypt itself. The reason for Egypt.

56:20.797 --> 56:23.717
My responsibility is Rome.

56:23.884 --> 56:27.179
Alexander understood it,

56:27.221 --> 56:30.682
that from Egypt, he
could rule the world.

56:32.017 --> 56:35.479
He was very young.
And you, even younger.

56:35.604 --> 56:40.108
At your age, such dreams have a
reality which grows less in time.

56:41.693 --> 56:43.570
Caesar no longer dreams?

56:43.695 --> 56:46.365
Dangerous to a man of my calling.

56:46.531 --> 56:50.077
Necessary, I would have thought.

57:07.010 --> 57:10.347
I cannot stay away from Rome
too long. There are problems.

57:10.389 --> 57:13.600
Messages from Marc Antony
endlessly demanding my return.

57:13.725 --> 57:18.146
And on my way back, wars to be
fought in the east and north.

57:18.188 --> 57:21.733
Even in Rome itself, I'm
not without opposition.

57:21.775 --> 57:24.528
Do to them what you did to Achillas.

57:24.653 --> 57:26.905
This is opposition of a different sort.

57:26.989 --> 57:29.908
They weave it cleverly
light, like a cobweb.

57:30.033 --> 57:34.079
You know what happens when cobwebs
are not regularly swept away.

57:34.204 --> 57:37.374
Do you trust this... Marc Antony?

57:37.499 --> 57:41.503
If anyone in the world, I trust Antony.

57:41.587 --> 57:46.466
Well, let him brush away the
cobwebs for you, and stay with me.

57:46.550 --> 57:49.136
You've been declared
dictator for a year.

57:49.177 --> 57:51.138
You can do what you
want to with your time.

57:51.221 --> 57:54.933
Everything but make it stand still.

57:56.184 --> 57:59.229
If, when you return to Rome,

57:59.396 --> 58:02.983
these wars that have to be fought
on the way, are they important?

58:03.066 --> 58:07.070
Well, there's no such
thing as an unimportant war.

58:07.195 --> 58:11.909
I've been reading in your commentaries
about your campaigns in Gaul.

58:12.075 --> 58:14.077
How does my writing
compare with Catallus?

58:14.119 --> 58:17.456
Well, it's different.

58:17.539 --> 58:19.708
Dull.

58:19.750 --> 58:22.586
Perhaps a little too much description.

58:22.711 --> 58:25.923
You're being tactful. Some of
my critics-- Brutus, for one--

58:26.131 --> 58:29.509
tell me my Latin is not only
ungrammatical, but common.

58:30.928 --> 58:34.181
You spared his life more than once.

58:34.264 --> 58:38.852
People say it's because Brutus
is your son. Is that true?

58:38.977 --> 58:42.064
I have no son.

58:42.231 --> 58:44.733
- Calpurnia, your third wife.
- Fourth.

58:44.900 --> 58:49.196
Married to you, how
long? Twelve years?

58:49.279 --> 58:52.950
And still, Caesar has
no son, no child at all.

58:53.116 --> 58:56.370
It is well known that
Calpurnia is barren.

58:56.495 --> 58:59.331
A woman who cannot bear children...

58:59.373 --> 59:02.793
is like a river that is dry.

59:02.918 --> 59:06.797
I see no purpose in
discussing the subject further.

59:06.964 --> 59:11.802
A woman, too, must make
the barren land fruitful.

59:11.802 --> 59:15.973
She must make life grow
where there was no life.

59:16.056 --> 59:20.811
Just as the Mother Nile feeds
and replenishes the earth.

59:23.188 --> 59:25.148
I am the Nile.

59:28.694 --> 59:31.780
I will bear many sons.

59:31.947 --> 59:33.907
Isis has told me.

59:36.159 --> 59:40.956
My breasts are filled
with love and life.

59:40.998 --> 59:44.001
My hips are rounded and well apart.

59:45.586 --> 59:49.590
Such women, they say, have sons.

01:00:12.779 --> 01:00:17.868
That first time when you stood
here alone, why did you cry?

01:00:17.951 --> 01:00:20.203
Will you tell me now?

01:00:20.287 --> 01:00:22.706
Because I had lost something.

01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:25.334
- What?
- A lifetime.

01:00:25.459 --> 01:00:27.961
- Mine.
- Nonsense.

01:00:28.128 --> 01:00:31.882
Having conquered the
world, he died at 32.

01:00:31.965 --> 01:00:34.384
I am 52.

01:00:34.468 --> 01:00:37.596
My remaining ambition is to keep
the world from conquering me.

01:00:40.891 --> 01:00:44.728
Your ambitions must
always have been his.

01:00:44.728 --> 01:00:46.772
They still must be.

01:00:46.855 --> 01:00:48.774
Shall I tell you something?

01:00:48.857 --> 01:00:52.486
When I was 32 in Spain,

01:00:52.569 --> 01:00:55.405
I came upon a statue of Alexander.

01:00:55.489 --> 01:00:57.783
I wept then too.

01:00:57.908 --> 01:00:59.826
Even then.

01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:03.872
I want you to have his
sword to take back with you.

01:01:03.914 --> 01:01:05.958
- Too deeply embedded.
- It can be removed.

01:01:06.124 --> 01:01:08.001
It's buried in time.

01:01:08.126 --> 01:01:11.380
- And Alexander's mantle?
- Too heavy for Caesar.

01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:17.261
His dream then.

01:01:17.386 --> 01:01:20.556
Make his dream yours, Caesar.

01:01:20.639 --> 01:01:23.976
His grand design.

01:01:24.101 --> 01:01:26.478
Pick it up where he left off.

01:01:28.272 --> 01:01:31.608
Out of the patchwork of conquests,

01:01:31.733 --> 01:01:33.860
one world.

01:01:33.944 --> 01:01:37.489
And out of one world, one nation.

01:01:37.531 --> 01:01:42.119
One people on Earth living in peace.

01:01:42.202 --> 01:01:45.581
So, you have told me, at last,
what it is you want of me.

01:01:45.747 --> 01:01:47.583
Of us!

01:01:47.708 --> 01:01:49.585
And the center, the
capital of this one world,

01:01:49.793 --> 01:01:52.546
one people, one nation: Alexandria?

01:01:52.588 --> 01:01:54.590
- He chose it.
- I am Roman.

01:01:54.631 --> 01:01:58.385
He was Greek! What will it
matter when we're all one people?

01:01:58.468 --> 01:02:01.555
I am 52. He was 32 and failed.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:03.557
We will succeed.

01:02:03.682 --> 01:02:07.394
Your dreams, your ambitions.

01:02:07.477 --> 01:02:11.106
One lifetime is not enough for
such dreams, such ambitions.

01:02:12.691 --> 01:02:15.527
The cloak of Alexander
cannot be too heavy...

01:02:15.527 --> 01:02:19.156
for Rome and Egypt to carry together.

01:02:19.323 --> 01:02:23.327
And what if his sword
is too deeply embedded?

01:02:23.535 --> 01:02:26.121
Yours will replace it, Caesar.

01:02:26.163 --> 01:02:29.333
You have a way of mixing
politics and passion.

01:02:29.541 --> 01:02:31.752
Where does one begin
and the other leave off?

01:02:31.877 --> 01:02:36.214
That did not start,
nor will it end with me.

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:40.385
Cleopatra, whatever it
is, however it comes out,

01:02:40.469 --> 01:02:43.263
leave me my destiny.

01:02:43.388 --> 01:02:47.726
Your destiny is no longer just yours.

01:02:47.768 --> 01:02:50.479
It's mine too.

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:55.525
Soon, there will be someone to
carry both the cloak of Alexander...

01:02:55.525 --> 01:03:01.156
and the sword of Caesar
and the name of Caesar.

01:03:01.281 --> 01:03:06.078
And in that name, he will rule Egypt.

01:03:06.203 --> 01:03:10.874
And what ever part or all of
the world that we give him,

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:17.965
our child, will be a
son for you, Caesar.

01:03:19.545 --> 01:03:25.966
By Isis, I swear it.

01:04:02.367 --> 01:04:04.286
I came as quick as I could.

01:04:04.369 --> 01:04:06.288
Antony is welcome to Caesar's house...

01:04:06.371 --> 01:04:09.708
as often and as quickly as he likes.

01:04:09.749 --> 01:04:13.336
As Caesar's wife, before the truth is
distorted into vicious Roman gossip,

01:04:13.545 --> 01:04:16.965
- I wanted you to hear-- - That my
husband has married Queen Cleopatra.

01:04:19.509 --> 01:04:23.597
There's some fresh wine.
One of your many favorites.

01:04:25.515 --> 01:04:29.769
The ceremony, according to vicious
gossip, was in the Egyptian religion.

01:04:29.895 --> 01:04:32.522
Even if true, that can't
be meant or taken seriously.

01:04:32.689 --> 01:04:36.485
During which, he was formally
declared an Egyptian god.

01:04:36.568 --> 01:04:39.613
Officially divine, at last.

01:04:39.696 --> 01:04:41.948
That must have pleased Caesar.

01:04:42.115 --> 01:04:46.036
Calpurnia, we know Caesar, you and I.

01:04:46.161 --> 01:04:49.247
This so-called marriage has
no validity under Roman law.

01:04:49.331 --> 01:04:51.500
There must have been
political purpose to it.

01:04:51.666 --> 01:04:54.586
Perhaps a symbolic ceremony to
ratify Rome's alliance with Egypt.

01:04:54.711 --> 01:04:58.298
Perhaps merely... indulging
some barbaric custom.

01:04:58.465 --> 01:05:00.759
You've been loyal and kind.

01:05:00.884 --> 01:05:03.720
You came as quickly as you could.

01:05:03.845 --> 01:05:07.557
Unhappily, vicious gossip
travels even faster than you...

01:05:07.724 --> 01:05:10.101
and the truth.

01:05:10.143 --> 01:05:14.189
Have you heard, for instance, that Queen
Cleopatra is carrying Caesar's child?

01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:18.735
Yes, Antony.

01:05:18.944 --> 01:05:22.739
We know him, you and I.

01:05:47.597 --> 01:05:49.850
There
shall be--

01:05:49.933 --> 01:05:53.728
There shall be... Rome,

01:05:53.895 --> 01:05:56.356
mighty and alone and unloved.

01:05:56.439 --> 01:05:58.483
A mistress.

01:05:58.650 --> 01:06:02.279
A mistress shall raise thee
again from Earth to heaven,

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:07.701
and all the world shall know a
golden age of justice and of love.

01:06:09.244 --> 01:06:11.455
A son shall be born to Isis!

01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:15.542
A son shall be born to Isis!

01:06:15.709 --> 01:06:18.503
Rome shall know him in cloth of gold.

01:06:18.587 --> 01:06:22.966
The East shall see him laden
with jewels and treasure.

01:06:23.091 --> 01:06:26.386
A son of Egypt and of Rome!

01:06:31.308 --> 01:06:35.979
Here shall he find his destiny!

01:07:07.886 --> 01:07:10.889
Do exactly as I tell you.

01:07:11.056 --> 01:07:13.558
When the child is born,

01:07:13.683 --> 01:07:17.562
after he is anointed
and named royal prince,

01:07:17.687 --> 01:07:20.899
- take him to Caesar.
- Bring Caesar here?

01:07:20.941 --> 01:07:25.445
No! Exactly as I tell you.

01:07:25.529 --> 01:07:29.616
Take the child to Caesar,
in front of his men.

01:07:29.699 --> 01:07:31.743
Do you understand?

01:07:31.868 --> 01:07:34.246
In front of all the Romans.

01:07:36.331 --> 01:07:39.459
Lay him at Caesar's feet.

01:07:39.584 --> 01:07:42.712
At Caesar's feet.

01:07:42.838 --> 01:07:44.881
I will do just as you say.

01:08:03.733 --> 01:08:05.986
Fear not. We have never lost a Caesar.

01:08:06.153 --> 01:08:08.446
That remark was not only
insubordinate, but in bad taste! I--

01:08:17.497 --> 01:08:20.250
Caesar, remember Roman law.

01:08:20.292 --> 01:08:22.919
If you pick up this child before
witnesses, you acknowledge it's yours...

01:08:23.044 --> 01:08:25.589
and a citizen of Rome, as your heir.

01:08:51.072 --> 01:08:55.493
- A son.

01:08:55.577 --> 01:08:58.078
I have a son!

01:08:58.121 --> 01:09:01.124
- Hail Caesar!
- Hail Caesar!

01:09:08.131 --> 01:09:10.133
He has been made king of Egypt.

01:09:10.258 --> 01:09:12.969
He and his Egyptian queen have
named their bastard Caesarion.

01:09:13.136 --> 01:09:14.970
Prince Caesarion.

01:09:15.138 --> 01:09:17.974
What better name for the
heir to the throne of Rome.

01:09:18.099 --> 01:09:20.310
There is no throne of Rome.

01:09:20.435 --> 01:09:23.063
Nor shall there be, nor
would Caesar tolerate one.

01:09:23.104 --> 01:09:24.939
But a son!

01:09:25.148 --> 01:09:28.318
We all know how much he's always
wanted one. I am happy for Caesar.

01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:31.696
Well, your happiness is
understandable enough.

01:09:31.738 --> 01:09:34.741
Now that Caesar has
publicly recognized a son,

01:09:34.866 --> 01:09:37.077
one need no longer wonder about Brutus.

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:40.663
Is it a relief not to be
wondered about, Casca?

01:09:40.705 --> 01:09:43.625
To be known openly as
you are for what you are:

01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:45.919
liar, swindler, bully and coward.

01:09:46.086 --> 01:09:49.296
Brutus, you'll turn Casca's
head with your flattery.

01:09:49.464 --> 01:09:53.885
And Casca's head, if
turned, will see Marc Antony.

01:09:54.094 --> 01:09:57.305
Apart of Caesar more to be feared,
I think, than his infant son.

01:09:59.057 --> 01:10:03.103
But it is for the good of Rome that
Caesar has stayed so long in Egypt.

01:10:03.145 --> 01:10:06.565
In his absence, the people have
come to worship him as a god.

01:10:06.690 --> 01:10:10.110
Why should he return to show
himself as mortal as the rest?

01:10:10.152 --> 01:10:13.697
There are those who
fear Caesar's ambition.

01:10:13.905 --> 01:10:16.825
But what is there to fear? That
he will destroy the republic?

01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:19.494
Yes, he will.

01:10:19.578 --> 01:10:21.538
I promise you he will.

01:10:21.621 --> 01:10:24.249
Your tongue is old, but sharp, Cicero.

01:10:24.374 --> 01:10:27.502
Be careful how you waggle it.
One day it will cut off your head.

01:10:27.669 --> 01:10:33.258
It will more likely be your sword,
Antony. 'Tis just as sharp and quicker...

01:10:33.341 --> 01:10:35.927
and frightened of heads.

01:10:38.054 --> 01:10:41.099
There'll be a strong smell
of wine in the Senate today.

01:10:41.266 --> 01:10:43.143
We must breathe with restraint.

01:10:48.565 --> 01:10:52.736
Octavian, this-- what's his
name-- this son of Caesar,

01:10:52.944 --> 01:10:54.779
does it upset you?

01:10:54.946 --> 01:10:58.366
- No.
- You run off at the mouth so.

01:10:58.492 --> 01:11:01.703
One would think your words were
as precious to you as your gold.

01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:06.291
Like my gold, I use them
where they are worth most.

01:11:06.458 --> 01:11:11.087
And your virtue? My
friend has a friend.

01:11:11.087 --> 01:11:13.048
That too.

01:11:13.131 --> 01:11:15.300
You know, it's quite possible, Octavian,

01:11:15.467 --> 01:11:17.344
that when you die,

01:11:17.469 --> 01:11:20.639
you will die without
ever having been alive.

01:11:55.924 --> 01:12:00.137
I can't leave without saying
good-bye to my son, to you.

01:12:00.262 --> 01:12:04.641
We thought, your son and
I, that if we came to you,

01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:07.352
we would have those few minutes more.

01:12:12.357 --> 01:12:15.318
A good thing to remember, my son,

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:18.446
what you will not let go,
no one will take from you.

01:12:22.117 --> 01:12:25.203
Hail and farewell, little Caesar.

01:12:39.176 --> 01:12:43.472
Was it a century ago when I was dropped
at your feet, wrapped in a carpet?

01:12:46.099 --> 01:12:48.143
Or was it last night?

01:13:00.113 --> 01:13:02.324
When will you send for us? When?

01:13:02.449 --> 01:13:05.952
- Soon.
- How soon? When?

01:13:06.119 --> 01:13:09.164
So much time must go by
before even I reach Rome.

01:13:09.206 --> 01:13:11.666
And then how soon?

01:13:11.708 --> 01:13:14.044
It will not be easy, but
within reasonable time.

01:13:14.169 --> 01:13:16.338
Time is never reasonable.

01:13:16.505 --> 01:13:18.256
Time is our enemy, Caesar.

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:22.302
Am I to conquer it for you? What
plan of battle do you suggest?

01:13:23.762 --> 01:13:26.848
I must bring your son to Rome.

01:13:26.890 --> 01:13:30.435
Rome must see Caesar's son...

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.980
who will one day rule
over Caesar's world.

01:13:34.105 --> 01:13:35.982
Caesar?

01:13:37.734 --> 01:13:40.195
I'm afraid that the tides
will soon be against you.

01:13:57.254 --> 01:14:00.048
Not only time, but the tides.

01:14:00.090 --> 01:14:03.552
Even as divinities, there seems
little we can do about either.

01:14:19.651 --> 01:14:21.695
But only after more than two years...

01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:25.532
and many wars in
Africa and Asia Minor...

01:14:25.657 --> 01:14:30.078
was Caesar able to cross over
to Italy and come home at last...

01:14:30.162 --> 01:14:34.249
to celebrate his triumphs
and see to his affairs.

01:14:56.396 --> 01:14:59.524
''In recognition of which, the
Senate has be stowed upon Caesar...

01:14:59.649 --> 01:15:04.696
the rank, privilege and title
of dictator of Rome for life.''

01:15:04.905 --> 01:15:07.073
Dictator for life.

01:15:07.157 --> 01:15:10.535
At long last, he is master of Rome.

01:15:10.702 --> 01:15:13.789
Apollodorus, everything
must be made ready at once.

01:15:13.914 --> 01:15:16.374
- Ships, servants-- - We've
been ready for some time.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:19.669
Surely now nothing can
prevent his sending for us.

01:15:19.878 --> 01:15:22.798
Why, If only to attend his
coronation as he attended mine.

01:15:22.881 --> 01:15:26.176
- Your Majesty-- - Three
long, wasted years!

01:15:26.259 --> 01:15:28.845
Why should the Senate
have taken so long...

01:15:29.054 --> 01:15:31.848
to recognize what the
world has already known,

01:15:31.890 --> 01:15:35.519
that Caesar was master of Rome?

01:15:35.685 --> 01:15:38.313
Rufio wishes to speak.

01:15:38.355 --> 01:15:40.524
Your Majesty seems to misunderstand.

01:15:40.690 --> 01:15:45.529
It seems quite clear. Caesar has been
declared dictator of Rome for life.

01:15:45.695 --> 01:15:51.118
True, however to the Roman, there is a
vast difference between dictator and master.

01:15:51.201 --> 01:15:53.453
No man can call himself master of Rome.

01:15:53.537 --> 01:15:55.455
Why not?

01:15:55.539 --> 01:15:59.668
It has a meaning far too close
to a word no Roman will tolerate:

01:15:59.793 --> 01:16:01.795
king.

01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:11.138
And to be dictator of Rome for life?

01:16:11.263 --> 01:16:15.851
Is to be granted the lifelong
respect and honor of the Roman people.

01:16:15.934 --> 01:16:19.104
And the dictates of the dictator?

01:16:19.104 --> 01:16:23.066
Must, in each case, of course, be
approved... by the Senate of Rome.

01:16:25.569 --> 01:16:27.737
Thank you, Rufio.

01:16:34.244 --> 01:16:36.371
The enemy! The enemy! The enemy!

01:16:36.455 --> 01:16:39.249
The enemy! The enemy!
The enemy! The enemy!

01:16:42.377 --> 01:16:45.255
The enemy! The enemy!

01:16:49.468 --> 01:16:51.344
Sisogenes.

01:16:53.847 --> 01:16:56.683
I suppose you think it's odd that I
should propose such an invitation...

01:16:56.850 --> 01:16:58.852
to Queen Cleopatra.

01:16:58.935 --> 01:17:00.854
- Do you?
- Egypt, after all,

01:17:00.979 --> 01:17:04.232
has been officially
declared ally of Rome.

01:17:04.357 --> 01:17:06.568
Still, I must confess I was
surprised at some of those...

01:17:06.693 --> 01:17:09.654
- who voted in favor.
- Were you?

01:17:09.863 --> 01:17:11.698
May I express, once
more, my gratitude...

01:17:11.865 --> 01:17:14.868
for being permitted to attend
today's session as a visitor?

01:17:14.910 --> 01:17:16.787
It was truly inspiring, Caesar,

01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:20.957
to witness the free will of
free men so fearlessly expressed.

01:17:23.168 --> 01:17:25.003
He seemed most anxious to be present.

01:17:25.170 --> 01:17:27.506
I saw no harm in
granting him permission.

01:17:27.631 --> 01:17:30.300
- Didn't you?
- After today, never again shall I doubt...

01:17:30.342 --> 01:17:33.845
the extent of Egypt's wealth.

01:17:34.012 --> 01:17:36.139
I don't like Cicero's implication.

01:17:36.348 --> 01:17:39.851
There's not enough gold in Egypt
to buy the honor of a Roman senator.

01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:44.272
More than enough, it
seems, to buy his vote.

01:17:46.316 --> 01:17:48.318
How was it now?

01:17:48.485 --> 01:17:52.364
'' Rome will know him
in cloth of gold.''

01:18:11.758 --> 01:18:15.679
According to reports, the reception
in the streets has been extraordinary.

01:18:15.846 --> 01:18:19.474
The queen has given instructions for the
procession to move as slowly as the people wish...

01:18:19.558 --> 01:18:21.685
for their full enjoyment.

01:18:21.852 --> 01:18:26.898
I might almost believe that Cleopatra
set out to capture the citizens of Rome.

01:18:27.065 --> 01:18:29.693
One would have every reason
for believing exactly that.

01:23:57.312 --> 01:24:01.358
Nothing like this has come into
Rome since Romulus and Remus.

01:24:55.203 --> 01:24:57.914
- How unafraid he is.
- Hmm?

01:24:57.914 --> 01:25:00.959
How unafraid he is.

01:27:08.503 --> 01:27:11.339
Your queen has conquered
the people of Rome.

01:27:11.465 --> 01:27:14.509
People, yes.

01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:29.316
Now, then, walk like a king. Head up.

01:27:29.399 --> 01:27:31.610
Listen to them cheer.

01:27:31.735 --> 01:27:36.031
Take your throne. Bow
to the right, left.

01:27:36.156 --> 01:27:40.368
Now an angry glance at
someone who's displeased you.

01:27:40.494 --> 01:27:43.789
Very good. I tremble. See me tremble?

01:27:43.872 --> 01:27:46.708
No. Don't smile.

01:27:46.833 --> 01:27:50.045
Not when they're trembling.
It makes them stop.

01:27:50.128 --> 01:27:53.089
Now the prisoners they
drag before you, one by one.

01:27:53.131 --> 01:27:56.676
This one has no power anywhere,
therefore means nothing.

01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:01.139
But you wish to be known as a
noble ruler. What do you say?

01:28:01.306 --> 01:28:04.351
I ''par do'' you.

01:28:04.434 --> 01:28:07.604
Louder, boy. You're going to
pardon somebody, you want it known.

01:28:07.813 --> 01:28:11.733
I ''par do'' you!

01:28:11.817 --> 01:28:15.779
Hmm. Ah, now, who comes here?

01:28:15.904 --> 01:28:20.450
Once your friend. You trusted
him, and he turned against you.

01:28:20.492 --> 01:28:23.036
He has power, wealth and family.

01:28:23.161 --> 01:28:26.164
He kneels before you. He begs
you to be his friend again,

01:28:26.248 --> 01:28:28.333
to have you trust him again.

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:31.086
And then... what then, little king?

01:28:31.128 --> 01:28:34.589
- Crrrck!

01:28:39.803 --> 01:28:43.348
Caesar must wish what needs commanding.

01:28:43.557 --> 01:28:46.810
To drain the Pontine Marshes.
To free Rome from malaria.

01:28:46.852 --> 01:28:48.770
To fill my belly.

01:28:48.895 --> 01:28:51.481
To control the Tiber's
floods and divert its course.

01:28:51.648 --> 01:28:55.861
To improve the harbor at
Ostia. To please my ambition.

01:28:55.944 --> 01:28:59.698
And must I wish roads to be
built, libraries for public use?

01:28:59.865 --> 01:29:02.576
The free men of Italy to be
equal citizens to those of Rome?

01:29:02.742 --> 01:29:05.704
Many of these have merits,
Caesar, and merit our approval.

01:29:05.912 --> 01:29:10.625
Merit your approval. Is Caesar to
come before the Senate each day...

01:29:10.750 --> 01:29:13.462
like a schoolboy with his
lessons, now passing, now failing?

01:29:13.628 --> 01:29:15.547
Do you suggest that the Senate...

01:29:15.630 --> 01:29:17.674
no longer deliberate
the welfare of Rome?

01:29:17.841 --> 01:29:19.926
Do you suggest an end to
the process of Roman law?

01:29:20.093 --> 01:29:24.097
I must be the law. And my word
must be the welfare of Rome.

01:29:25.765 --> 01:29:31.104
Else, take from me this
meaningless title of dictator.

01:29:31.146 --> 01:29:33.815
I've carried a sword for too long.

01:29:33.899 --> 01:29:35.901
I cannot now pretend
with an empty scabbard.

01:29:39.070 --> 01:29:42.699
Surely, Caesar must recall the
symbolic nature of the title dictator...

01:29:42.783 --> 01:29:44.743
at the time it was conferred upon him.

01:29:44.743 --> 01:29:47.454
It was to honor Caesar above all men...

01:29:47.579 --> 01:29:51.249
and to indicate the gratitude of Rome
for Caesar's triumphs in its name.

01:29:51.458 --> 01:29:56.463
Brutus, I recall them
well, those triumphs.

01:29:56.588 --> 01:29:58.507
Do you?

01:29:58.548 --> 01:30:01.426
Pharsalia, for one, when you
trembled in Antony's hand...

01:30:01.551 --> 01:30:03.804
when Antony was hot to
separate you from your head...

01:30:03.929 --> 01:30:06.181
with just cause.

01:30:06.348 --> 01:30:09.267
It was by my command
that your life was spared.

01:30:09.351 --> 01:30:12.979
There was no deliberating body. It
was not by my wish, but by my command.

01:30:13.146 --> 01:30:15.148
By my dictate, if you will,
that you stand here tonight.

01:30:15.232 --> 01:30:17.692
dribbling virtue out of
the corners of your mouth.

01:30:17.776 --> 01:30:20.195
Sit down.

01:30:20.278 --> 01:30:24.199
No, I want no more meaningless
privileges and considerations.

01:30:24.366 --> 01:30:27.369
No more honors designed to pacify me.

01:30:27.494 --> 01:30:30.789
I would far rather have nothing.
Remain what I am, at heart,

01:30:30.872 --> 01:30:33.500
a humble man, anxious only to serve.

01:30:35.961 --> 01:30:38.713
Why are the eyes of a
statue always without life?

01:30:42.175 --> 01:30:44.553
Have any of you here seen the Nile?

01:30:44.594 --> 01:30:47.013
Spare yourselves the journey.

01:30:47.139 --> 01:30:50.892
She carries it within her eyes.

01:30:50.976 --> 01:30:53.520
I suggest, Caesar,
that the hour is late.

01:30:53.645 --> 01:30:55.605
Very late for Rome.

01:30:55.730 --> 01:30:57.732
I was speaking,
Cassius! I was--

01:31:01.194 --> 01:31:02.988
Now, where was I?

01:31:03.196 --> 01:31:05.031
Anxious to serve.

01:31:06.533 --> 01:31:10.662
Yes, I've served, served
for all of my life.

01:31:10.745 --> 01:31:13.790
I've won for Rome more
than half of the world.

01:31:13.957 --> 01:31:17.002
Most of you here owe your
honors and your fortunes to me.

01:31:17.169 --> 01:31:21.631
And now I want you to do as I say.

01:31:21.715 --> 01:31:25.552
You will appoint me... emperor of Rome.

01:31:31.683 --> 01:31:35.020
There is no need to resume your seats.

01:31:35.103 --> 01:31:37.063
May I, on be half of all, once again...

01:31:37.105 --> 01:31:39.357
thank you, Gracious Majesty,
for your hospitality.

01:31:41.693 --> 01:31:43.737
Good night.

01:31:46.907 --> 01:31:49.159
Thank you and good night.

01:31:58.877 --> 01:32:00.712
They resent being summoned here, Caesar,

01:32:00.879 --> 01:32:03.381
for meetings more properly
held in the Senate.

01:32:03.548 --> 01:32:05.509
Resent it, do they?

01:32:07.093 --> 01:32:11.348
I cannot understand that
the eyes of a statue should be eyes without life...

01:32:54.099 --> 01:32:58.186
Are you quite sure what it is
you want... so desperately?

01:32:59.630 --> 01:33:01.414
I've always been sure.

01:33:03.050 --> 01:33:03.852
And Caesar?

01:33:05.152 --> 01:33:07.070
Does anyone speak for him?

01:33:10.073 --> 01:33:12.200
No.

01:33:12.284 --> 01:33:14.244
Good night.

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:24.296
Tell me, Brutus, is it proper
to stand before this new goddess,

01:33:24.337 --> 01:33:27.716
which Caesar has set here in the
temple, or must we, as Romans, kneel?

01:33:28.825 --> 01:33:29.665
Not yet!

01:33:30.245 --> 01:33:30.666
Caesar has .... left for a diade

01:33:33.094 --> 01:33:37.026
Then the God Caesar stands
beside the Goddess Cleopatra.

01:33:37.470 --> 01:33:39.485
Then Rome will crawl before
them both.

01:33:39.486 --> 01:33:41.208
Let that day come, if it comes.

01:33:41.209 --> 01:33:43.272
You heard, that the man has
 been made an Emperor

01:33:43.273 --> 01:33:45.187
Once that one night
 and it was his sickness

01:33:45.326 --> 01:33:48.365
His sickness grows worse
 and in the end it will kill us all.

01:33:48.366 --> 01:33:50.490
Only once since he asked to be made Emperor,

01:33:50.513 --> 01:33:52.505
but he has sence to creed himself a God

01:33:52.810 --> 01:33:54.174
Emperor and God.

01:33:54.578 --> 01:33:57.300
No longer not just King,
but Emperor and God

01:33:57.301 --> 01:33:58.735
Use and open your eyes!

01:33:58.736 --> 01:34:00.765
What is it you want!
What do you want of me!

01:34:01.175 --> 01:34:05.160
When the people think upon the honor
of Rome, they think upon one man.

01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:06.144
He is Brutus!

01:34:06.455 --> 01:34:08.624
By that honor and by the
responsibility you carry,

01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:12.208
Brutus, save Rome from Caesar!

01:34:12.249 --> 01:34:14.835
You cannot ask me to destroy him.

01:34:15.044 --> 01:34:17.922
Then let Caesar destroy Rome.

01:34:35.689 --> 01:34:40.027
Antony has just come from a meeting
of my friends, with good news.

01:34:40.027 --> 01:34:44.490
Tomorrow at the Senate, Lucius
Cotta will move that I be made king.

01:34:44.615 --> 01:34:47.034
It will pass.

01:34:47.076 --> 01:34:49.787
But... I don't understand.

01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:52.248
King and emperor.

01:34:52.289 --> 01:34:54.291
And it will pass?

01:34:54.417 --> 01:34:56.752
For the last few months,
I've been quietly enjoying...

01:34:56.877 --> 01:34:59.505
one of the few privileges
of being dictator.

01:34:59.588 --> 01:35:01.590
I have been appointing senators.

01:35:01.715 --> 01:35:03.759
Slightly more than half the
Senate has, at the moment,

01:35:03.884 --> 01:35:06.679
been appointed by me.

01:35:06.804 --> 01:35:09.849
Once again, the army of Mithradates...

01:35:09.890 --> 01:35:12.435
on its way all the time.

01:37:02.732 --> 01:37:05.359
Why-- Why then
not only Rome,

01:37:05.443 --> 01:37:07.904
but this whole peninsula of
Italy, upon which Rome stands,

01:37:07.945 --> 01:37:09.947
must fall in your hands
like a drop of sweat.

01:37:09.989 --> 01:37:12.533
Let them make you king or whatever
they choose, wherever they choose.

01:37:12.617 --> 01:37:14.744
Let me serve with you.
My legions with yours.

01:37:14.785 --> 01:37:16.746
Together we'll conquer
for Caesar a world...

01:37:16.829 --> 01:37:18.956
beyond the wildest dreams
of even-- even Alexander.

01:37:18.998 --> 01:37:23.211
Rome. What was Rome when Sulla died,

01:37:23.377 --> 01:37:26.422
when Crassus lost the
armies in Parthia?

01:37:26.547 --> 01:37:28.549
These same men came after
me through the streets,

01:37:28.591 --> 01:37:30.801
howling like frightened dogs.

01:37:30.968 --> 01:37:33.304
"Caesar, save us!"

01:37:33.429 --> 01:37:35.806
They would've made me king then.

01:37:35.932 --> 01:37:38.434
- I wouldn't let them then.

01:37:48.892 --> 01:37:52.354
He was thrown over the wall. It's not
a pretty sight. It might be better if--

01:37:52.479 --> 01:37:55.232
Titus, the moneylender.

01:37:55.315 --> 01:37:58.527
Why should anyone kill him as
savagely as this and bring him here?

01:37:58.693 --> 01:38:01.696
Obviously, I am being warned.

01:38:01.863 --> 01:38:03.740
Perhaps I am next.

01:38:03.823 --> 01:38:06.535
They dare to threaten you?

01:38:06.701 --> 01:38:09.246
- Caesarion. Where was
my son-- - Not far away.

01:38:09.371 --> 01:38:11.331
It frightened him.

01:38:17.963 --> 01:38:20.507
Lepidus. How many legions has he now?

01:38:20.590 --> 01:38:22.759
- Fifteen. Perhaps more.
- Where?

01:38:22.842 --> 01:38:26.263
- Scythia.
- We will dine with Lepidus tonight, you and I.

01:38:26.304 --> 01:38:30.642
We'll talk of armies and
battlefields and lists of men to die.

01:38:30.850 --> 01:38:34.896
And tomorrow in the Senate, let them offer
so much as the sands of Libya as my kingdom,

01:38:35.063 --> 01:38:36.940
I will accept.

01:39:17.105 --> 01:39:21.234
This is great Caesar, beloved by Rome,

01:39:23.153 --> 01:39:25.488
and at least one of us...

01:39:25.614 --> 01:39:29.075
who must die so that Rome may live.

01:39:29.076 --> 01:39:31.636
If it must be done, then let us
 do it on our shame,

01:39:31.637 --> 01:39:32.637
and not of raid.

01:39:34.362 --> 01:39:37.990
If the world is to know that it
is Rome that will not have a king,

01:39:38.074 --> 01:39:40.201
then let us make it the
honorable and open act...

01:39:40.368 --> 01:39:42.411
of free men in the light of day.

01:39:42.537 --> 01:39:44.831
In the light of what day, Brutus?

01:39:44.997 --> 01:39:47.750
Tomorrow?

01:39:47.875 --> 01:39:50.962
In the curia of the Senate.

01:39:52.463 --> 01:39:54.757
And shall we be armed, all of us?

01:40:00.179 --> 01:40:05.601
Decimus, you will come to Caesar's villa
early tomorrow to escort him to the Senate.

01:40:05.643 --> 01:40:10.148
Cimber, Marc Antony must not
enter the curia with Caesar.

01:40:10.189 --> 01:40:12.150
On some pretext, you
must lead him aside...

01:40:12.233 --> 01:40:14.819
to speak perhaps of what you
heard at Lepidus' house tonight.

01:40:15.027 --> 01:40:17.613
I remember something odd.

01:40:17.738 --> 01:40:20.408
At one point, Caesar suddenly
asked of each of us...

01:40:20.533 --> 01:40:23.244
what manner of death we would choose.

01:40:23.411 --> 01:40:27.206
And Caesar, when it came to him,
looked straight at me and said,

01:40:27.331 --> 01:40:29.250
"Sudden."

01:40:31.335 --> 01:40:33.212
Odd, isn't it?

01:40:56.736 --> 01:40:58.905
I was afraid I'd find you still asleep.

01:40:59.071 --> 01:41:02.325
Caesarion is. He was
awake most of the night.

01:41:02.450 --> 01:41:04.368
Did the storm frighten him?

01:41:04.410 --> 01:41:08.498
He said not, but it did. I could tell.

01:41:08.581 --> 01:41:10.458
Have you time to come in?

01:41:10.583 --> 01:41:13.211
Decimus is waiting. He came
by early this morning....

01:41:13.252 --> 01:41:15.379
expressly to accompany me to the Senate.

01:41:15.463 --> 01:41:18.382
Decimus? Has he done this before?

01:41:18.549 --> 01:41:21.385
A shrewd politician. He hopes
to benefit by arriving with me,

01:41:21.469 --> 01:41:23.596
this day of days.

01:41:23.638 --> 01:41:26.182
Keep Antony close by.

01:41:28.142 --> 01:41:30.061
You too?

01:41:30.186 --> 01:41:33.231
The ladies of Rome seem to have
caught each other's fears this morning,

01:41:33.356 --> 01:41:35.274
like a head cold.

01:41:35.399 --> 01:41:38.611
Calpurnia actually pleaded with
me not to go to the Senate at all.

01:41:38.736 --> 01:41:42.365
Why? Why would she not want you to go?

01:41:42.406 --> 01:41:45.034
Oh, the bad night. Nothing else.

01:41:45.159 --> 01:41:48.412
She awoke screaming in her
sleep. The thunder, the lightning.

01:41:48.454 --> 01:41:52.959
She dreamed that she saw me
murdered, that she saw me...

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.461
or a statue of me covered in blood.

01:41:55.628 --> 01:41:59.006
And the servants. The servants told her
of seeing men of fire in the heavens,

01:41:59.090 --> 01:42:01.217
odd happenings in the city and so forth.

01:42:01.342 --> 01:42:04.137
Strange and solitary birds
were seen in the Forum.

01:42:04.262 --> 01:42:06.139
They said one flew
into the Senate itself,

01:42:06.264 --> 01:42:11.185
carrying a sprig of laurel, which it
dropped at the base of Pompey's statue.

01:42:12.478 --> 01:42:15.356
Pompey?

01:42:15.398 --> 01:42:20.027
- Caesar, I'm afraid.
- You must not tell me to stay away.

01:42:20.153 --> 01:42:22.613
Shall I, too, be afraid?

01:42:22.655 --> 01:42:26.659
Can it be said of Caesar that he gave
up the world because of a thunder storm?

01:42:26.784 --> 01:42:30.788
That such divinity that was in him
ran before mortal superstition?

01:42:30.872 --> 01:42:35.751
I feel that you need me
now, and I cannot help you.

01:42:35.835 --> 01:42:39.130
Then help me to live as I have lived:

01:42:39.213 --> 01:42:41.466
always differently from the rest.

01:42:41.507 --> 01:42:45.595
The others, for whom life is
merely an endless fear of dying.

01:42:47.346 --> 01:42:52.059
Your gods and mine go with you, Caesar.

01:42:54.061 --> 01:42:58.483
The world, except for you,
is filled with little men.

01:44:04.966 --> 01:44:07.009
Fire burns.

01:44:07.135 --> 01:44:10.430
Fire burns.

01:44:10.555 --> 01:44:13.474
The winds of destruction blow.

01:44:15.309 --> 01:44:18.354
Rome, mighty and alone,

01:44:18.438 --> 01:44:21.441
the winds of destruction
blow down upon thee!

01:44:21.566 --> 01:44:23.985
Storm sand hail shall cut down wheat,

01:44:24.110 --> 01:44:27.029
shall cut down birds and
living things of Earth.

01:44:27.155 --> 01:44:29.574
The heavens...

01:44:29.699 --> 01:44:32.368
and the gods themselves.

01:46:45.418 --> 01:46:47.420
My son!

01:47:03.269 --> 01:47:06.647
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

01:47:06.898 --> 01:47:10.526
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

01:49:51.062 --> 01:49:53.689
I would have come sooner,
but there was much to do.

01:49:53.898 --> 01:49:56.651
And it seems you have
done it extremely well.

01:49:59.195 --> 01:50:01.364
Is that
where--

01:50:01.447 --> 01:50:03.407
Yes.

01:50:06.202 --> 01:50:11.124
In Egypt, we build eternal
monuments to our dead heroes.

01:50:11.207 --> 01:50:15.545
Here, you burn them
like rubbish. Good-bye.

01:50:15.628 --> 01:50:18.714
I've brought some of the 10th Legion with
me, and Rufio. You have nothing to fear.

01:50:20.258 --> 01:50:23.678
Nothing to fear? That's
no reason for staying.

01:50:25.263 --> 01:50:27.557
So much has happened so quickly.

01:50:27.682 --> 01:50:31.269
Suddenly I have the pieces
of a broken world to pick up.

01:50:31.394 --> 01:50:34.063
Caesar, you running
off at night like this.

01:50:34.147 --> 01:50:36.232
Do you suggest that I stay? Why?

01:50:36.399 --> 01:50:40.528
Don't ask me to be clear about
my feelings right now. I'm tired.

01:50:40.611 --> 01:50:43.823
And with you, even at my best,
it's never easy to say my meaning.

01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:47.785
But you speak so well, Antony.

01:50:47.785 --> 01:50:51.205
I've been told how excitingly
you read Caesar's will...

01:50:51.330 --> 01:50:55.418
to the sobbing, murdering,
free citizens of Rome,

01:50:55.585 --> 01:51:00.006
naming as his heir his
great nephew, Octavian.

01:51:00.173 --> 01:51:02.842
I knew Caesar's will
and the reasons for it.

01:51:03.050 --> 01:51:05.595
If Octavian had not been named,
how many hours, how many minutes...

01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:09.390
would you and your son
have survived, do you think?

01:51:09.599 --> 01:51:12.351
And if Caesar had become truly king,

01:51:12.435 --> 01:51:15.521
do you believe he would
still have named Octavian?

01:51:18.024 --> 01:51:20.026
In any case, it's over.

01:51:20.151 --> 01:51:25.656
Caesar and the dream that
was murdered with him.

01:51:25.823 --> 01:51:28.284
First Alexander's...

01:51:28.451 --> 01:51:31.454
then Caesar's.

01:51:31.662 --> 01:51:33.664
Now over. Finished.

01:51:33.831 --> 01:51:36.542
- First, Rome must be put in order.
- Rome again.

01:51:36.667 --> 01:51:39.629
Brutus, Cassius, some of the others have
escaped. They must be hunted down and killed.

01:51:39.754 --> 01:51:42.882
- And then?
- Then in death, Caesar must be granted the power and title...

01:51:43.007 --> 01:51:45.259
he was denied in life, deified even.

01:51:45.426 --> 01:51:49.722
A dead king, a dead god.
Safe enough even for Rome.

01:51:49.847 --> 01:51:55.269
Caesarion as Caesar's son could claim
both the title of king and his deification.

01:51:55.394 --> 01:51:59.398
And to what court of law would
my son and I take our claim?

01:51:59.565 --> 01:52:02.777
I will present it to
the Roman Senate myself.

01:52:05.196 --> 01:52:08.241
I believe you would.

01:52:08.366 --> 01:52:11.410
And after the noble senators
have stopped laughing,

01:52:11.577 --> 01:52:14.956
do my son and I then
declare war on Rome?

01:52:15.081 --> 01:52:19.669
No. For this, a Caesar would be needed.

01:52:19.794 --> 01:52:22.213
You have very little time.

01:52:24.715 --> 01:52:27.051
Another Caesar.

01:52:27.176 --> 01:52:31.639
But thank you. I shall
remember your kindness to us.

01:52:31.806 --> 01:52:34.434
- You give up too easily.
- Do I?

01:52:36.060 --> 01:52:38.855
Let me come to Alexandria
and talk more with you.

01:52:39.021 --> 01:52:42.775
- Whenever you like.
- Now. Tonight, if I could.

01:52:45.194 --> 01:52:47.405
In any case, try to remember.

01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:23.455
And for more than two years did Antony
seek out the assassins of Caesar.

01:54:24.043 --> 01:54:26.120
At last, at Philippi,

01:54:24.919 --> 01:54:29.882
he was able to set against them
his legions and those of Octavian,

01:54:30.007 --> 01:54:32.801
who was Caesar's heir.

01:54:32.968 --> 01:54:36.447
Cassius was the first to die,
by his own hand,

01:54:37.362 --> 01:54:40.233
then Brutus and the others.

01:56:18.068 --> 01:56:20.529
Hail Antony!

01:56:20.695 --> 01:56:22.906
Hail Antony!

01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:29.204
Hail Antony's legions!

01:56:41.592 --> 01:56:44.595
You remember Philippi.

01:56:44.636 --> 01:56:46.889
He won it.

01:56:47.014 --> 01:56:48.932
My lord.

01:56:49.057 --> 01:56:53.145
- This way.
- But my tent is this way.

01:56:55.439 --> 01:57:00.110
Later. I'll see him later.
Octavian depresses me.

01:57:00.152 --> 01:57:02.279
You promised.

01:57:12.164 --> 01:57:16.168
Well, the fighting's
over. We won it all.

01:57:16.251 --> 01:57:18.212
Your health should improve quickly now.

01:57:18.378 --> 01:57:21.048
Even lf I were to die, my
place is with you on the field.

01:57:21.131 --> 01:57:23.800
- You were wrong in preventing me.
- Caesar was too ill to sit his horse.

01:57:24.009 --> 01:57:27.554
Caesar? Ah, yes. I keep forgetting.

01:57:27.638 --> 01:57:30.474
I have inherited the
name. I have made it mine.

01:57:30.557 --> 01:57:34.895
Why not? You'll never be
confused with the other one.

01:57:34.978 --> 01:57:38.524
At least your troops fought
bravely, under my command.

01:57:38.607 --> 01:57:41.360
Agrippa has kept me fully informed.

01:57:41.401 --> 01:57:43.237
What were you doing there?

01:57:43.362 --> 01:57:45.239
The battle was fought
on land, between men,

01:57:45.405 --> 01:57:47.282
not great lumps of
wood bumping on water.

01:57:47.407 --> 01:57:50.744
Why did you bring Agrippa?
Were you expecting rain?

01:57:50.828 --> 01:57:54.206
- Shall we choose a piece of land, Antony, just you and I?
- Be quiet.

01:57:54.331 --> 01:57:56.667
There are matters we have to talk about.

01:57:56.750 --> 01:57:59.670
Have you an objection
to Agrippa remaining?

01:57:59.711 --> 01:58:04.174
I object to Agrippa at all times.

01:58:09.972 --> 01:58:15.018
Lying here, indisposed, you must
have had time to consider the problem.

01:58:15.185 --> 01:58:18.564
I think it is best to
continue the Triumvirate.

01:58:18.605 --> 01:58:21.942
You and I and Lepidus.

01:58:22.067 --> 01:58:23.986
Very well.

01:58:24.027 --> 01:58:28.031
Lepidus shall have Africa and
the islands. You, Spain and Gaul.

01:58:28.198 --> 01:58:32.953
Rome and Italy to be administered
by the three of us jointly.

01:58:33.036 --> 01:58:34.913
- And you?
- All the east.

01:58:35.038 --> 01:58:39.960
Then, with Lepidus in
Africa and you in the east,

01:58:40.002 --> 01:58:42.629
bringing order to Rome and
Italy will be my problem.

01:58:42.713 --> 01:58:44.590
So it seems.

01:58:44.756 --> 01:58:46.758
Spain and Gaul are wot enough
for me. I shall need money.

01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:50.012
- There have been tax riots in Rome already.
- So I've heard.

01:58:52.472 --> 01:58:54.391
Done.

01:58:56.935 --> 01:58:58.854
And done.

01:59:22.638 --> 01:59:25.016
Would Caesar approve, do you think?

01:59:25.183 --> 01:59:29.604
Definitely. Perhaps the veil of Isis
would have bothered him just a bit.

01:59:29.812 --> 01:59:31.731
Three years.

01:59:31.772 --> 01:59:35.818
And Rome remembers him only
by the image on a gold coin.

01:59:35.985 --> 01:59:38.613
Are they those I brought back with me?

01:59:38.738 --> 01:59:40.823
After all, when Octavian
had them struck off,

01:59:40.907 --> 01:59:44.076
it was to commemorate
Caesar's deification.

01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:49.123
So that he could inherit Caesar's
divinity together with all the rest.

01:59:49.123 --> 01:59:52.126
Even a dead god cannot rewrite his will.

01:59:52.210 --> 01:59:55.338
Antony did present Caesarion's
claims to the Senate.

01:59:55.421 --> 01:59:58.174
He kept that much of his promise.

01:59:58.341 --> 02:00:01.093
And he will keep the rest of it.

02:00:01.219 --> 02:00:04.222
After almost three years
since Caesar's death,

02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:06.432
more than a year since Philippi?

02:00:06.557 --> 02:00:10.019
Antony will come. He will need Egypt.

02:00:10.102 --> 02:00:12.396
Egypt is you.

02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:16.609
That's what I meant, of
course. Antony will need me.

02:00:22.573 --> 02:00:24.909
Finances! You make my head
hurt when you talk of money.

02:00:24.992 --> 02:00:26.911
Now, change the subject.

02:00:26.994 --> 02:00:30.832
All right. News from Rome.

02:00:30.957 --> 02:00:34.293
Octavian has forced Lepidus out
of his command and into exile.

02:00:39.132 --> 02:00:43.344
I wish I hadn't-- I wish I
had not drunk so much today.

02:00:43.469 --> 02:00:45.972
So do I.

02:00:46.097 --> 02:00:49.308
Do I trouble you, Rufio?

02:00:49.433 --> 02:00:51.310
Yes, you do.

02:00:53.521 --> 02:00:55.773
I'll wager you never found
Caesar befuddled by wine.

02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:57.817
Nothing, no one ever befuddled Caesar.

02:00:57.942 --> 02:01:00.361
Antony, the campaign against
Parthia will not be an easy one.

02:01:00.445 --> 02:01:03.197
- How many legions have we left?
- Well, it's hard to tell.

02:01:03.364 --> 02:01:06.409
- None of them up to strength, so many desertions.
- Desertions?

02:01:06.576 --> 02:01:09.370
They haven't been paid in months.

02:01:11.372 --> 02:01:13.499
Do you remember when
we started into Greece?

02:01:13.666 --> 02:01:16.377
I lived with them, ate with
them. I was one of them.

02:01:16.502 --> 02:01:20.506
They seem distant to me now, as if
they were-- as if they were a memory.

02:01:24.844 --> 02:01:27.513
We must find the gold to pay them,

02:01:27.597 --> 02:01:31.976
the wheat to feed them,
supplies, ships, armor.

02:01:32.018 --> 02:01:35.605
And where do you suggest
we look for all these?

02:01:35.730 --> 02:01:38.775
- I thought perhaps further to the east.
- Syria?

02:01:38.816 --> 02:01:42.195
- Perhaps more to the south.
- Ethiopia?

02:01:42.361 --> 02:01:44.322
To the north
of Ethiopia--

02:01:44.363 --> 02:01:46.199
- I have forbidden you to mention her.
- I didn't.

02:01:46.407 --> 02:01:48.284
I will not crawl to her,
hand held out like a beggar.

02:01:48.409 --> 02:01:50.286
- Why has she wot offered me assistance?
- Perhaps she doesn't know.

02:01:50.369 --> 02:01:52.288
Of course she knows.
She knows everything.

02:01:52.371 --> 02:01:54.290
If only out of gratitude
for what I've done for her--

02:01:54.373 --> 02:01:56.292
- Perhaps she wishes to express it in person.
- Then let her come to me.

02:01:56.375 --> 02:01:58.336
Am I so much less than Caesar?

02:01:58.336 --> 02:02:01.798
Nor is she less than Cleopatra,
queen of Egypt. And you promised--

02:02:01.923 --> 02:02:04.759
Queens! Queen! Strip them as naked as
any other woman, they're no longer queens.

02:02:04.801 --> 02:02:08.763
It is also difficult to tell
the rank of a naked general.

02:02:08.930 --> 02:02:11.599
And generals without
armies are naked indeed.

02:02:13.017 --> 02:02:16.562
All right. I'll meet her halfway.

02:02:16.771 --> 02:02:20.108
I'll send you to her. You
order her to come to me.

02:02:20.191 --> 02:02:22.902
- If I am to order her, I need not make the journey.
- Then summon her.

02:02:23.111 --> 02:02:26.155
- Even worse.
- Then beg, entreat, cajole. Find the word you like best.

02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:29.117
Pour perfume. Whinny like
a stallion if you choose.

02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:31.369
But see that she comes to me.

02:02:31.536 --> 02:02:34.914
I understand your position, Rufio.

02:02:34.956 --> 02:02:37.416
Surely you must understand mine.

02:02:37.542 --> 02:02:41.170
I do not intend to join
that long list of queens...

02:02:41.212 --> 02:02:45.133
who have quivered happily at
being summoned by Lord Antony.

02:02:45.174 --> 02:02:47.218
But surely I didn't say "summoned."

02:02:47.426 --> 02:02:50.471
You said "invite." He meant "summon."

02:02:50.596 --> 02:02:53.975
In any case, I am the queen of Egypt.

02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:57.395
And I choose to remain on Egyptian soil.

02:02:57.520 --> 02:02:59.772
Tarsus is not the
other end of the world,

02:02:59.814 --> 02:03:02.525
- Your Majesty.
- If it were one step from Egypt,

02:03:02.567 --> 02:03:04.485
that would be too far.

02:03:06.112 --> 02:03:09.157
I will meet with Lord Antony...

02:03:10.533 --> 02:03:12.952
but only on Egyptian soil.

02:03:13.035 --> 02:03:18.207
My lady, a way must be found, a
time, a place to satisfy you both.

02:03:18.332 --> 02:03:20.376
Must it, Rufio?

02:04:37.161 --> 02:04:39.831
Cleopatra.

02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:05.064
Cleopatra!

02:05:09.531 --> 02:05:13.535
It is. It must be.

02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:33.638
She said never, except on Egyptian soil.

02:05:33.847 --> 02:05:36.016
"Never." Something
women say to begin with.

02:05:36.182 --> 02:05:38.351
You will welcome Queen
Cleopatra on my behalf.

02:05:38.476 --> 02:05:41.855
You will extend my invitation to a
banquet in her honor at the palace tonight.

02:05:42.022 --> 02:05:45.442
- Don't you think perhaps-- - Still
not convinced, Rufio? Hurry back.

02:05:45.609 --> 02:05:49.196
There's much to be done. Have
someone send the cooks to me.

02:06:25.398 --> 02:06:29.027
Forgive me, noble Rufio. It
is you who do not understand.

02:06:29.152 --> 02:06:33.782
Queen Cleopatra, at present below in
her chamber, is on Egyptian territory...

02:06:33.907 --> 02:06:35.784
and intends to remain on it.

02:06:35.951 --> 02:06:38.578
Most learned Sisogenes, you must
forgive me when I point out...

02:06:38.662 --> 02:06:40.914
that this is Tarsus, not Alexandria.

02:06:41.039 --> 02:06:45.001
You are on Tarsus, noble
Rufio. I am on Egypt.

02:06:45.043 --> 02:06:49.756
Tonight and tomorrow night, if Lord
Antony desires to meet Her Majesty,

02:06:49.839 --> 02:06:53.134
he will come to her, to Egypt.

02:06:55.095 --> 02:06:58.431
I shall do my best, learned friend,
to prevail upon Lord Antony to attend.

02:08:55.048 --> 02:08:57.968
Marc Antony, how prompt you are.

02:08:58.051 --> 02:09:00.512
If I had not been, it
would be unforgivable of me.

02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:04.140
I had hoped to be here to
welcome you as you came aboard.

02:09:04.266 --> 02:09:06.977
If you had been, it would
be unforgivable of me.

02:09:07.018 --> 02:09:10.814
Be more tolerant. Forgive
yourself now and then.

02:09:12.899 --> 02:09:16.820
Almost three years. Is it possible
that you've become even more beautiful?

02:09:16.945 --> 02:09:19.406
Almost three? That long?

02:09:19.531 --> 02:09:21.575
The time has passed so quickly.

02:09:21.658 --> 02:09:25.662
Your necklace. It seems
to be made of gold coins.

02:09:25.787 --> 02:09:28.832
Coins of Caesar.

02:09:28.999 --> 02:09:31.793
- Do you find it attractive?
- Very.

02:09:31.918 --> 02:09:35.130
And I find what you're
wearing most becoming.

02:09:35.130 --> 02:09:39.259
- Greek, isn't it?
- I have a fondness for almost all Greek things.

02:09:39.342 --> 02:09:43.263
As an almost all-Greek
thing, I'm flattered.

02:09:48.143 --> 02:09:50.437
An unusual necklace.

02:09:50.562 --> 02:09:52.772
Nothing but gold coins of Caesar.

02:09:52.981 --> 02:09:56.026
- How did you come by it?
- I had it made.

02:09:56.151 --> 02:09:58.028
I wear it always.

02:10:58.338 --> 02:11:00.590
A fabulous feast.

02:11:00.632 --> 02:11:03.969
One is so limited when
one travels by ship.

02:11:04.052 --> 02:11:05.971
This fabulous ship,

02:11:06.179 --> 02:11:09.391
together with its queen,
the fabulous Cleopatra.

02:11:09.558 --> 02:11:15.105
The name of Marc Antony is not
exactly unknown to the world.

02:11:15.230 --> 02:11:19.109
- Why, in the last year or so
since we met-- - Almost three.

02:11:19.192 --> 02:11:23.655
By now you have become
one-third the master of Rome.

02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:26.199
You don't permit yourself
to forget him, is that it?

02:11:26.241 --> 02:11:29.995
That's an odd way of putting
it. Don't permit myself?

02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:33.957
You find it necessary to
wear him around your neck?

02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:36.626
You forget, Antony,

02:11:36.793 --> 02:11:40.714
in these almost three years,
how full your own life has been.

02:11:40.839 --> 02:11:45.218
These can't have been uneventful
years for you. You rule Egypt alone.

02:11:45.427 --> 02:11:50.140
Oh, they have been busy, but
not full. There's a difference.

02:11:50.265 --> 02:11:53.935
There cannot be enough
hours in the days of a queen,

02:11:53.977 --> 02:11:56.187
and her nights have too many.

02:11:56.271 --> 02:11:59.524
-So I fill them with memories.
- Of Caesar?

02:11:59.608 --> 02:12:03.820
And of a dream... that almost came true.

02:12:03.904 --> 02:12:05.780
You may remember.

02:12:05.822 --> 02:12:09.784
I remember that night in Rome,
saying it could still come true.

02:12:09.826 --> 02:12:15.040
You said so much that night to so many.

02:12:30.347 --> 02:12:34.935
- Let me get rid of them all.
- Why? I have arranged an entertainment.

02:12:35.018 --> 02:12:38.772
A dance in the Greek fashion
to welcome the god Bacchus.

02:12:38.855 --> 02:12:42.234
If I make a great show of
going, they'll have to leave too.

02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:45.237
Then I can return
and we can, uh--

02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:48.532
we can talk alone, you and I.

02:12:48.615 --> 02:12:53.119
- When would you return?
- In an hour, no more than two.

02:12:53.203 --> 02:12:55.288
How long would you stay?

02:12:55.455 --> 02:12:58.750
Until we had nothing more to say.

02:12:58.792 --> 02:13:02.963
Are you a strong swimmer
? We sail at sunrise.

02:13:05.131 --> 02:13:07.008
I don't understand.

02:13:07.133 --> 02:13:10.804
Home to Alexandria, to Egypt.

02:13:10.929 --> 02:13:14.140
Then you've come all this
way for just this one night?

02:13:14.182 --> 02:13:16.351
All this way to make a fool of me.

02:13:16.434 --> 02:13:18.645
Perhaps you would feel less of a fool...

02:13:18.770 --> 02:13:21.857
lf you stayed the night
with me, is that it?

02:13:24.234 --> 02:13:26.528
I've told you before.

02:13:26.611 --> 02:13:29.906
With you, words do
not come easily to me.

02:13:30.031 --> 02:13:32.617
There is too much unsaid
within me that I cannot say.

02:13:32.742 --> 02:13:34.661
Then I cannot know it.

02:13:34.744 --> 02:13:36.913
There is much unsaid within you too.

02:13:36.997 --> 02:13:39.791
That is probably true of everybody.

02:13:39.833 --> 02:13:42.210
Stay for a while.

02:13:42.335 --> 02:13:45.630
I have known you so long but so little.

02:13:45.630 --> 02:13:48.008
- Give me time.
- Not I,

02:13:48.133 --> 02:13:50.010
not Egypt and Rome together.

02:13:50.135 --> 02:13:54.848
Not even the gods have time to give you.

02:13:55.015 --> 02:13:57.601
But, Antony, use what you have.

02:13:57.726 --> 02:14:02.731
Don't waste it by playing
at god here in Tarsus...

02:14:02.856 --> 02:14:06.943
while Octavian in Rome becomes a god.

02:19:04.858 --> 02:19:06.817
He's...

02:19:06.902 --> 02:19:08.820
here.

02:19:08.861 --> 02:19:12.657
One step behind Caesar, at
the right hand of Caesar,

02:19:12.699 --> 02:19:16.702
in the shadow of Caesar.

02:19:16.827 --> 02:19:20.290
Tell me. Tell me how many
have loved you since him?

02:19:20.415 --> 02:19:23.126
One? Ten? Anyone? No one?

02:19:23.293 --> 02:19:25.504
Have they kissed you with Caesar's
lips, touched you with his hands?

02:19:25.629 --> 02:19:27.547
Has it been his name you've
cried out in the dark?

02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:29.633
And afterwards, alone,
has he reproached you,

02:19:29.716 --> 02:19:32.552
and have you begged
forgiveness of his memory?

02:19:32.636 --> 02:19:36.932
You've come here, then, running
over with wine and self-pity...

02:19:37.014 --> 02:19:39.058
to conquer Caesar.

02:19:39.142 --> 02:19:44.022
For so long now, you've filled my life,

02:19:44.106 --> 02:19:49.653
like-- like a great noise that
I hear everywhere in my heart.

02:19:49.695 --> 02:19:54.825
I want to be free of you, of
wanting you, of being afraid.

02:19:57.452 --> 02:20:00.455
Yet Caesar would not permit it.

02:20:21.935 --> 02:20:24.438
But I will never...

02:20:24.479 --> 02:20:26.440
be free of you.

02:20:42.623 --> 02:20:45.459
From the first instant
I saw you entering Rome...

02:20:45.584 --> 02:20:48.086
on that monstrous stone beast,

02:20:48.253 --> 02:20:53.425
shining in the sun like
a-- like a little gold toy,

02:20:53.508 --> 02:20:56.261
how I envied Caesar.

02:20:56.428 --> 02:20:58.430
I went suddenly sick with it.

02:20:58.555 --> 02:21:00.474
Not his conquests or his triumphs.

02:21:00.515 --> 02:21:03.518
Not his titles or the
roaring of the mob.

02:21:03.644 --> 02:21:05.938
I envied him you.

02:21:09.399 --> 02:21:13.153
When we first met in
Rome, I remembered you...

02:21:13.320 --> 02:21:15.781
and I wondered that I
could ever have forgotten.

02:21:15.906 --> 02:21:17.950
Remembered me?

02:21:18.075 --> 02:21:20.827
Years ago, when you were
a young cavalry officer...

02:21:21.036 --> 02:21:23.080
stationed at the palace in Alexandria...

02:21:23.205 --> 02:21:25.082
under the command of
that fat Roman general.

02:21:25.207 --> 02:21:27.834
- What was his name?
- Mm, Gabinius.

02:21:27.960 --> 02:21:29.920
Gabinius.

02:21:30.087 --> 02:21:34.049
I was 12 years old and I loved you.

02:21:34.132 --> 02:21:37.344
- Nonsense.
- It's true.

02:21:37.469 --> 02:21:41.014
Lovers always want so much
never to have loved before.

02:21:42.683 --> 02:21:44.518
It's possible, you know.

02:21:44.643 --> 02:21:47.104
It becomes a game.
Who loved whom first?

02:21:47.229 --> 02:21:49.523
I did.

02:21:49.606 --> 02:21:55.028
If you noticed me at all in those
days, you were probably terrified of me.

02:21:55.153 --> 02:21:58.949
And with good reason. Everybody
knows Romans cut up little children...

02:21:58.991 --> 02:22:00.909
and feed them to their horses.

02:22:05.872 --> 02:22:08.917
We'll make this our beginning.

02:22:09.084 --> 02:22:11.169
Beginning with tonight,

02:22:11.253 --> 02:22:13.922
you must never envy Caesar...

02:22:14.089 --> 02:22:17.551
or anyone, anything again.

02:22:26.635 --> 02:22:31.599
After all, this is nothing new.

02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:33.642
For so many years,

02:22:33.642 --> 02:22:35.853
Antony has fed upon the crumbs...

02:22:35.936 --> 02:22:39.607
that fell from Julius Caesar's table.

02:22:41.066 --> 02:22:45.653
I say-- I say they are
deserving of each other.

02:22:45.654 --> 02:22:47.370
Let him stay in Egypt.

02:22:47.900 --> 02:22:49.963
Let him put away his life as he chooses

02:22:49.994 --> 02:22:53.220
but not the possessions of the Empire
 of the Roman people

02:22:56.930 --> 02:23:00.509
The Roman people, what a glorian
possessions to them

02:23:00.610 --> 02:23:03.106
Is there Antony content.

02:23:04.030 --> 02:23:06.196
Then, so are they.

02:23:08.090 --> 02:23:12.585
Does their Antony sweep
their empire under Cleopatra's bed

02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:19.020
Here is adoring Roman sigh,
and remain content

02:23:19.820 --> 02:23:23.616
Let him stay however
distant for however long...

02:23:23.699 --> 02:23:26.035
with never a thought of them.

02:23:26.077 --> 02:23:29.288
The Roman people hold
him close to their hearts.

02:23:29.330 --> 02:23:32.458
- Distant?
- Perhaps from Rome...

02:23:32.583 --> 02:23:36.045
but not from Caesar, I
think, nor from Caesar's son.

02:23:36.212 --> 02:23:38.965
Germanicus, do you speak of me?

02:23:39.048 --> 02:23:40.925
No, Octavian. I speak of Caesar.

02:23:41.050 --> 02:23:43.970
I am Caesar.

02:23:44.136 --> 02:23:46.973
Only while Antony remains...

02:23:47.139 --> 02:23:49.141
distant from Rome.

02:23:51.936 --> 02:23:54.021
Antony!

02:23:54.105 --> 02:23:56.774
Stay not too long in Alexandria!

02:24:00.027 --> 02:24:05.783
Germanicus, stay not too long in Rome.

02:24:26.137 --> 02:24:28.639
How much of this is known to Antony?

02:24:28.723 --> 02:24:31.434
All of it and more. I have
written him regularly--

02:24:31.601 --> 02:24:34.604
letters, reports, dispatches
by personal messenger.

02:24:34.645 --> 02:24:38.649
- And what has he answered?
- He wrote that he was no longer interested...

02:24:38.733 --> 02:24:40.985
in the matters I described to him.

02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:42.945
That he would not return to Rome.

02:24:43.154 --> 02:24:47.366
That he understood quite clearly
what was at stake, what he would lose.

02:24:47.408 --> 02:24:49.619
But that he would not leave you.

02:25:07.428 --> 02:25:11.265
Ah, well, let's try the goat.

02:25:14.060 --> 02:25:15.937
All right.

02:25:16.062 --> 02:25:19.607
Let's have that goat
again. There. Not too much.

02:25:19.732 --> 02:25:22.234
There. Mm-hmm.

02:25:22.401 --> 02:25:27.448
The milk of a cow, of
a goat and of an ass.

02:25:27.615 --> 02:25:29.533
Which, would you say, is
best for softening the beard?

02:25:29.617 --> 02:25:33.412
Is it true that Octavian
shaves but once a week?

02:25:33.496 --> 02:25:38.042
Even then, he has merely to face
the wind and let the fuzz blow away.

02:25:38.209 --> 02:25:41.837
You knew, didn't you, that
Germanicus was here from Rome?

02:25:41.963 --> 02:25:43.839
Yes.

02:25:43.965 --> 02:25:47.677
Have you strong feelings about beards?
I had one in my youth. Bright red it was.

02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:49.679
Why haven't you seen him?

02:25:57.353 --> 02:26:00.022
When you go,

02:26:00.147 --> 02:26:02.024
must it be for very long?

02:26:02.191 --> 02:26:05.820
I must take some of these back
with me. They don't have them.

02:26:05.903 --> 02:26:08.447
At least they didn't
when I was last in--

02:26:08.572 --> 02:26:10.449
in Rome.

02:26:18.457 --> 02:26:22.044
While they were digging
the foundation of my tomb,

02:26:22.169 --> 02:26:25.214
the workers found an old wall.

02:26:25.339 --> 02:26:29.927
Someone had scratched on
it hundreds of years ago,

02:26:30.011 --> 02:26:34.348
"You were not here last
night, and I could not sleep.

02:26:35.349 --> 02:26:37.143
Will you be here tonight?"

02:26:39.186 --> 02:26:42.398
Do you suppose they ever met again?

02:26:44.108 --> 02:26:48.070
Everything that I shall want to
hold or look upon or have or be...

02:26:48.195 --> 02:26:51.449
is here now with you.

02:26:51.532 --> 02:26:53.993
I must not be sorry for myself.

02:26:54.118 --> 02:26:58.623
Queens are sometimes no better at
that than kings, or even princes.

02:27:01.208 --> 02:27:03.210
It doesn't seem fair.

02:27:04.754 --> 02:27:08.174
What I feel I should
have felt long ago...

02:27:08.341 --> 02:27:13.387
when I was very young, when I could say
to myself that this was how love was...

02:27:13.429 --> 02:27:16.098
and how it would be.

02:27:16.223 --> 02:27:21.145
But to have waited so
long, to know so suddenly,

02:27:21.354 --> 02:27:23.147
this late...

02:27:23.314 --> 02:27:27.735
how it hurts, how love
can stab the heart.

02:27:37.370 --> 02:27:40.206
Be careful with Octavian.

02:27:40.331 --> 02:27:42.833
Well, let him be careful with me.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.962
The Romans want no war
between the two of you.

02:27:46.045 --> 02:27:48.839
In any case, you are not ready yet.

02:27:48.923 --> 02:27:52.510
War? The world is filled with
love. There will be no more wars.

02:27:52.635 --> 02:27:54.845
You must have your share.

02:27:54.929 --> 02:27:59.058
Your titles and powers
must be spelled out exactly.

02:27:59.141 --> 02:28:02.687
There can be no question of your
complete authority in the East.

02:28:05.606 --> 02:28:07.608
Antony, how will I live?

02:28:07.650 --> 02:28:11.362
The same as I.

02:28:11.445 --> 02:28:13.990
One breath upon the other,

02:28:14.031 --> 02:28:19.495
each bringing us one breath... closer.

02:28:19.578 --> 02:28:23.833
You take so much of me with you so far.

02:28:24.041 --> 02:28:27.003
Remember, remember. They'll
want you to forget. Please--

02:28:27.211 --> 02:28:30.756
Forget? How?

02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:35.052
I can never be more
far away from you than--

02:28:35.177 --> 02:28:37.096
than this.

02:28:48.441 --> 02:28:50.526
He will come first to Brindisium.

02:28:50.610 --> 02:28:55.865
Agrippa and I plan to, uh, welcome
his arrival with a great ceremony.

02:28:55.990 --> 02:29:00.411
Antony must be made to know how dear
to the hearts of the Romans, of us all,

02:29:00.536 --> 02:29:02.455
he is and has been.

02:29:02.496 --> 02:29:06.417
He has been away for a very long time.

02:29:06.542 --> 02:29:10.046
Perhaps we can persuade him
to stay with us even longer.

02:29:10.212 --> 02:29:14.967
Perhaps, Octavia, if you came
to Brindisium, you could help.

02:29:15.051 --> 02:29:18.137
You may have forgotten. It is
no more than six months since--

02:29:18.220 --> 02:29:21.390
Begging the pardon of
Agrippa and our ancestors,

02:29:21.557 --> 02:29:25.144
I do not agree that a young
widow must retire from life.

02:29:25.227 --> 02:29:28.648
You haven't left my house
since your husband died.

02:29:28.773 --> 02:29:33.277
If only for the sake of your
health, the change alone--

02:29:36.238 --> 02:29:40.034
Then, begging the pardon of my
Lord Agrippa and our ancestors,

02:29:40.159 --> 02:29:43.371
I would look forward
very much to the change.

02:29:45.790 --> 02:29:50.628
Nothing. No one could possibly
shine more brightly in the sun.

02:29:50.795 --> 02:29:53.339
Not only Antony, I know of no man...

02:29:53.422 --> 02:29:56.259
who would not hold out his
greedy fists for Octavia.

02:29:56.342 --> 02:29:59.762
After all, what greater
pledge could I offer...

02:29:59.845 --> 02:30:01.931
of my goodwill toward him?

02:30:02.056 --> 02:30:06.352
And how could Antony more clearly
show his love of peace and Rome...

02:30:06.435 --> 02:30:09.313
- than by accepting?
- And Cleopatra?

02:30:11.148 --> 02:30:14.360
Are you suggesting we
invite her to the wedding?

02:30:14.443 --> 02:30:16.487
Do you remember Julius
Caesar when he returned...

02:30:16.570 --> 02:30:19.740
and those months at the
end while she was in Rome?

02:30:19.824 --> 02:30:23.035
There was a poison in
his heart, in his brain.

02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:25.246
Yes, I know. The falling sickness.

02:30:25.329 --> 02:30:28.332
But more than that. Cleopatra.

02:30:28.457 --> 02:30:31.544
- I remember well.
- Antony is no Caesar.

02:30:31.627 --> 02:30:34.547
I am grateful for that.

02:30:34.588 --> 02:30:36.716
Granted that he marries Octavia,

02:30:36.841 --> 02:30:38.801
will he forget Cleopatra?

02:30:38.926 --> 02:30:41.053
Will she permit him to forget?

02:30:41.137 --> 02:30:43.139
Most probably not.

02:31:29.060 --> 02:31:31.562
- Have I permission to speak?
- Tell me quickly.

02:31:31.604 --> 02:31:35.191
A galley came to Pelusium
with news from Rome.

02:31:35.191 --> 02:31:38.194
Lord Antony and Octavian Caesar
have met and sealed a great pact.

02:31:38.235 --> 02:31:41.989
Antony has taken ten more legions
and all of the East for his domain.

02:31:42.114 --> 02:31:44.116
Egypt will be declared ally of Rome.

02:31:44.200 --> 02:31:46.035
It is done.

02:31:48.037 --> 02:31:51.082
- There is more.
- No. No more, my lord.

02:31:51.207 --> 02:31:54.085
- He's afraid.
- Is there anything more?

02:31:55.670 --> 02:31:59.548
Forgive me, divine Majesty.
There-- There has been a marriage.

02:31:59.590 --> 02:32:02.260
A marriage of state.

02:32:02.385 --> 02:32:06.222
Between Octavia, the sister of Caesar,

02:32:07.807 --> 02:32:10.017
and Lord Antony.

02:32:14.021 --> 02:32:15.898
Anything more?

02:32:16.065 --> 02:32:17.942
They're presently in Athens.

02:32:18.025 --> 02:32:21.988
Sometime, within the year, Lady
Octavia is to return to Rome.

02:32:22.029 --> 02:32:23.948
Lord Antony will come to Alexandria...

02:32:24.031 --> 02:32:26.659
to negotiate the alliance
of Rome and Egypt.

02:32:41.382 --> 02:32:43.259
Leave me.

02:32:46.470 --> 02:32:48.389
No.

02:32:49.974 --> 02:32:51.851
Completely alone.

02:33:26.260 --> 02:33:29.138
Antony!

02:36:07.672 --> 02:36:09.632
Do you find it pleasing, my lord?

02:36:09.799 --> 02:36:12.051
Huh?

02:36:12.134 --> 02:36:14.136
Oh, yes. Very.

02:36:14.178 --> 02:36:19.600
It was made here in Athens. Not as
practical as our Roman ones, of course.

02:36:19.725 --> 02:36:24.063
The Greeks have such
a weakness for beauty.

02:36:36.242 --> 02:36:38.995
Does the dinner not
please you, my lord?

02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:41.414
Very much. I'm not particularly hungry.

02:36:41.497 --> 02:36:44.041
If there is anything that
would please you more--

02:36:44.250 --> 02:36:46.669
Believe me, I am pleased, Octavia.

02:36:48.838 --> 02:36:53.759
The gods know you do nothing
but please me, in every way.

02:37:01.142 --> 02:37:03.060
Word from Domitius?

02:37:03.102 --> 02:37:05.354
He never even reached the palace.

02:37:05.438 --> 02:37:08.357
As a matter of fact, he was not
permitted through the city gate.

02:37:12.528 --> 02:37:15.990
If I may be excused.

02:37:16.073 --> 02:37:18.034
There is no need for you to go.

02:37:18.242 --> 02:37:21.454
When I hear matters of
state discussed by men,

02:37:21.579 --> 02:37:24.290
invariably I find
myself wondering about...

02:37:24.415 --> 02:37:27.126
why the wine has gone sour.

02:37:27.251 --> 02:37:29.128
Good night, Rufio.

02:37:29.962 --> 02:37:31.839
Good night, my lord.

02:37:39.388 --> 02:37:42.642
Domitius turned away at the gate.

02:37:42.767 --> 02:37:45.186
That makes how many?

02:37:45.269 --> 02:37:48.898
Five of your ambassadors
turned away within this year.

02:37:49.065 --> 02:37:50.983
Now, if you'd gone
in the first place--

02:37:51.150 --> 02:37:55.071
It was the only favor I ever
asked of you. You granted it.

02:37:55.237 --> 02:37:57.114
The treaty with Egypt must be made.

02:37:57.239 --> 02:37:59.200
For too long we have
received no wheat, no gold--

02:37:59.325 --> 02:38:02.328
I cannot go to her to
negotiate a treaty!

02:38:02.495 --> 02:38:05.748
She will have no one else.

02:38:05.790 --> 02:38:09.168
And what if she should... turn me away?

02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:12.797
That would be quite impossible.

02:38:16.133 --> 02:38:18.302
Have you ever really left her?

02:38:21.055 --> 02:38:22.974
No.

02:38:37.613 --> 02:38:40.449
For three days now I have waited
for an audience with you, alone.

02:38:40.616 --> 02:38:42.451
What is the purpose of the audience?

02:38:42.576 --> 02:38:44.578
Get out, all of you. I wish
to see Her Majesty privately.

02:38:44.662 --> 02:38:47.581
- You stand before the throne of Egypt.
- I know where I am!

02:38:47.623 --> 02:38:51.419
- You will state your purpose.
- Matters I have no intention of discussing publicly.

02:38:51.544 --> 02:38:55.798
I do not grant private audiences
to unidentified persons.

02:38:57.800 --> 02:39:00.344
I am Marcus Antonius.

02:39:00.511 --> 02:39:04.515
I know who you are. What
are you, at the moment?

02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:09.645
Envoy of Rome, pro-consul of all the
Roman Empire to the east of Italy.

02:39:09.770 --> 02:39:11.731
An impressive title.

02:39:11.856 --> 02:39:14.358
Worthy, perhaps, of a private audience?

02:39:14.442 --> 02:39:17.194
Without a treaty of alliance with Egypt,

02:39:17.236 --> 02:39:20.448
you could not hold the
territories under your command.

02:39:20.615 --> 02:39:23.451
- True?
- Possibly.

02:39:23.534 --> 02:39:25.786
Then, Lord Antony, you come before me...

02:39:25.911 --> 02:39:28.998
-as a suppliant.
- If you choose to regard me as such.

02:39:29.206 --> 02:39:31.042
I do.

02:39:31.250 --> 02:39:35.630
You will therefore assume the position
of a suppliant before this throne.

02:39:35.713 --> 02:39:37.632
You will kneel.

02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:43.763
- I will what?
- On your knees.

02:39:45.348 --> 02:39:48.392
You dare ask the pro-consul
of the Roman Empire--

02:39:48.434 --> 02:39:50.937
I asked it of Julius Caesar.

02:39:51.020 --> 02:39:53.731
I demand it of you!

02:40:05.701 --> 02:40:10.247
Now, you may have the
treaty you asked for...

02:40:10.331 --> 02:40:12.541
on the follow ingconditions.

02:40:12.583 --> 02:40:15.753
By your authority as
pro-consul of Rome,

02:40:15.795 --> 02:40:19.548
you will cede to Egypt immediately
the following territories:

02:40:19.590 --> 02:40:23.970
Judea,Jordan, Armenia, Phoenicia,
the provinces of Sinai and Arabia,

02:40:24.136 --> 02:40:27.390
the islands of Cyprus and Crete.

02:40:29.767 --> 02:40:32.186
You ask for one-third
of the Roman Empire.

02:40:32.270 --> 02:40:34.605
Put it another way.

02:40:34.730 --> 02:40:37.400
I give to you two-thirds.

02:40:39.944 --> 02:40:43.447
Most generous. I, uh, cannot accept.

02:40:43.614 --> 02:40:47.410
I suggest you deliberate further.

02:40:47.451 --> 02:40:50.454
Perhaps consult with your superior...

02:40:50.538 --> 02:40:53.249
-in Rome.
- My superior?

02:40:53.332 --> 02:40:55.584
Octavian.

02:40:55.793 --> 02:40:57.670
Caesar Octavian?

02:41:04.260 --> 02:41:06.637
You have not been dismissed.

02:41:11.058 --> 02:41:13.936
You are now dismissed.

02:42:05.529 --> 02:42:10.368
Outside, all of you. Her Majesty
and I will speak in private.

02:42:10.451 --> 02:42:13.412
Out! Before I chop you up
and feed you to my horses.

02:42:13.496 --> 02:42:16.999
That's how Romans frighten little girls.

02:42:17.166 --> 02:42:20.336
They like to frighten
little girls. Wait outside.

02:42:32.181 --> 02:42:35.017
I married Octavia at her brother's
insistence, before all Rome,

02:42:35.142 --> 02:42:37.937
as a gesture of good faith, a
guarantee of peace, a bargain sealed.

02:42:37.937 --> 02:42:42.400
With a kiss? Or did you simply
shake hands on your wedding night?

02:42:42.441 --> 02:42:46.112
The people of Rome were celebrating
the marriage, even before I arrived.

02:42:46.195 --> 02:42:48.906
- How could I refuse?
- By saying no.

02:42:49.073 --> 02:42:51.784
As you have said no to all my demands.

02:42:51.909 --> 02:42:53.828
But they're impossible, unreasonable.

02:42:53.911 --> 02:42:58.082
- Conditions one lays down for a helpless enemy.
- You're not helpless... yet.

02:42:58.165 --> 02:43:01.168
I cannot cede to you
the territories you want.

02:43:01.252 --> 02:43:03.254
It would lead to an open
break between Rome and me.

02:43:03.337 --> 02:43:05.965
Why do you think I asked for them?

02:43:06.048 --> 02:43:09.343
It would be playing into
Octavian's hands, what he hopes for.

02:43:09.427 --> 02:43:12.972
- It would not be wise!
- What is wise?

02:43:13.014 --> 02:43:16.601
To hand over Rome, Italy,
the world to Octavian?

02:43:16.767 --> 02:43:19.729
To grovel publicly
before his authority?

02:43:19.812 --> 02:43:22.648
Take his sister to wed and to bed...

02:43:22.732 --> 02:43:24.650
as if to beg forgiveness...

02:43:24.775 --> 02:43:28.738
for having stayed so long
with your Egyptian harlot.

02:43:33.784 --> 02:43:36.537
What has angered you?

02:43:36.579 --> 02:43:39.915
That I dealt with Octavian however I could
or that I married his sister to do it?

02:43:39.999 --> 02:43:42.835
-Jealousy or politics? Which?
- Both!

02:43:43.002 --> 02:43:45.212
And damn you for not
understanding either.

02:43:45.338 --> 02:43:47.423
It would not occur to me to
look to you for instruction.

02:43:47.548 --> 02:43:50.968
Which is why you have come back
chained to Octavian like a slave.

02:43:51.177 --> 02:43:54.972
- Slave!
- And with such an exquisite set of chains.

02:43:55.056 --> 02:43:58.851
So softly spoken, so virtuous.

02:43:58.935 --> 02:44:02.813
She sleeps, I hear, fully clothed.

02:44:05.608 --> 02:44:09.195
- I've come back. That's all that should concern you.
- Should it?

02:44:09.320 --> 02:44:14.450
How long before your master snaps his
finger and you run back to him, or her?

02:44:17.787 --> 02:44:22.375
I have only one master. My love for you.

02:44:22.541 --> 02:44:24.335
No.

02:44:24.460 --> 02:44:27.505
Your master must not be love.

02:44:27.630 --> 02:44:30.049
Never love.

02:44:30.216 --> 02:44:32.301
Give yourself to love,

02:44:32.510 --> 02:44:34.387
and you give yourself
to forget fulness...

02:44:34.512 --> 02:44:38.057
of what you are and who
you are and what you want.

02:44:38.182 --> 02:44:41.602
And what you want is
worth so much more?

02:44:41.727 --> 02:44:45.398
I will not have love as my master.

02:44:45.564 --> 02:44:48.776
- Then you will not have love.
- Not will I have Octavian.

02:44:50.945 --> 02:44:54.532
- Never fear.
- How confident you are.

02:44:54.657 --> 02:44:57.159
And has Octavian a master?

02:44:57.243 --> 02:45:01.038
His ambition: to rule the
Roman world as emperor and god.

02:45:01.122 --> 02:45:03.833
The Roman world, to begin with.

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:07.003
And what stands in his way?

02:45:07.128 --> 02:45:10.047
- You and I.
- And my son,

02:45:10.172 --> 02:45:13.843
the rightful heir to the name
and glory of great Caesar.

02:45:14.010 --> 02:45:17.263
Octavian has already stolen those,

02:45:17.388 --> 02:45:22.560
and he will now destroy, in the name of
his sister, the love Rome has for you.

02:45:22.643 --> 02:45:28.399
And by your marriage to her, he has
made of me unmistakably your whore.

02:45:28.566 --> 02:45:32.445
Never fear Octavian?

02:45:32.612 --> 02:45:37.950
It is he now who, I
think, must be unafraid.

02:45:42.455 --> 02:45:44.624
Show me a city, and I'll
tell you how to take it.

02:45:44.749 --> 02:45:47.919
Let me face an army. I'll smell out its
weak points, hit them hard where they are.

02:45:48.002 --> 02:45:52.256
But make me to sit down and talk
in whispers of this and that...

02:45:52.340 --> 02:45:56.802
with an emphasis here and a shrug there,
and I'm soon confounded and defeated.

02:45:58.638 --> 02:46:01.807
Meaning to do the
best, I suppose I--

02:46:01.933 --> 02:46:04.226
I supposed I could not have done worse.

02:46:09.607 --> 02:46:11.609
There is still time.

02:46:11.734 --> 02:46:16.155
Let someone ask me what I want.

02:46:16.238 --> 02:46:19.784
To live with you in peace and love.

02:46:19.951 --> 02:46:24.956
Do you have-- Do you have
conditions for total surrender?

02:46:24.997 --> 02:46:27.750
First, as did Caesar,

02:46:27.792 --> 02:46:32.046
you will marry me according
to Egyptian ritual.

02:46:32.129 --> 02:46:34.340
That's not a condition. That's a reward.

02:46:34.382 --> 02:46:36.634
You will declare, by your authority,

02:46:36.759 --> 02:46:39.303
Caesarion to be king of Egypt,

02:46:39.387 --> 02:46:42.598
and we will rule together in his name.

02:46:42.640 --> 02:46:44.600
Happily granted.

02:46:44.684 --> 02:46:48.896
You will cede to Egypt all the
territories I have demanded.

02:46:52.066 --> 02:46:53.943
You must,

02:46:54.068 --> 02:46:57.863
if only to assert your--
your own authority and power.

02:46:57.947 --> 02:47:02.201
Otherwise, inevitably, in
time we will lose everything.

02:47:02.326 --> 02:47:04.203
Can't you see that?

02:47:06.330 --> 02:47:10.042
I can see nothing... but you.

02:47:16.424 --> 02:47:19.093
I am no longer content
to forgive Antony!

02:47:19.260 --> 02:47:22.638
To marry this Egyptian according
to their barbaric rites.

02:47:22.638 --> 02:47:25.850
Meaningless under Roman
law! Great Caesar himself--

02:47:25.975 --> 02:47:29.854
Yes. Bit by bit Antony
crawls behind his memory.

02:47:29.979 --> 02:47:31.856
But tell us this, Germanicus.

02:47:31.981 --> 02:47:35.526
Did great Caesar also toss
one-third of the Roman Empire...

02:47:35.651 --> 02:47:39.238
into Cleopatra's
undoubtedly deserving lap?

02:47:39.322 --> 02:47:41.741
Let it be known that the
territories in dispute...

02:47:41.782 --> 02:47:43.659
were subjugated by Julius Caesar.

02:47:43.784 --> 02:47:47.580
There can be no question that the right to
rule over them is the heritage of his son.

02:47:47.705 --> 02:47:49.790
And in the name of the mighty Caesar,

02:47:49.915 --> 02:47:53.711
I grant to King Ptolemy
Caesarion that right.

02:47:55.588 --> 02:47:59.467
And let it be known that the greatness
of Rome lies not in what she takes...

02:47:59.592 --> 02:48:01.719
but in what she gives.

02:48:06.223 --> 02:48:09.977
"Rome's greatness lies in
what she gives," he says,

02:48:10.061 --> 02:48:13.439
then calmly gives what is not his.

02:48:13.564 --> 02:48:18.569
And Cleopatra takes and will take more.

02:48:18.694 --> 02:48:21.030
And war will come.

02:48:21.197 --> 02:48:24.075
She knows and I know...

02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:26.619
that war will come.

02:48:26.702 --> 02:48:29.246
But I will not speak for it,

02:48:29.413 --> 02:48:32.291
nor will I speak against Antony.

02:48:34.126 --> 02:48:37.088
I must be forced into war.

02:48:37.171 --> 02:48:40.591
The people of Rome must
force this war upon me.

02:48:40.758 --> 02:48:45.221
They must storm the doors
of the Senate crying for it.

02:48:45.313 --> 02:48:49.067
If we move quickly, the Romans will not
know we have crossed the Mediterranean...

02:48:49.192 --> 02:48:51.027
until we land in Greece.

02:48:51.194 --> 02:48:54.113
You and General Rufio will start
embarking the troops at once.

02:48:54.197 --> 02:48:56.115
Yes, Your Majesty.

02:48:57.492 --> 02:49:00.203
If it is decided to move
our armies into Greece.

02:49:00.369 --> 02:49:02.246
It has been decided.

02:49:02.330 --> 02:49:05.583
My men do not... travel well by sea.

02:49:05.750 --> 02:49:08.377
They fight on land. They move on land.

02:49:08.461 --> 02:49:11.547
Your men will do as they
are told, as mine will.

02:49:11.589 --> 02:49:15.259
My men will do as they're told
by me. They have not yet become--

02:49:18.596 --> 02:49:21.641
They are still Roman.

02:49:21.766 --> 02:49:23.768
However,

02:49:23.851 --> 02:49:27.188
since I do
as I'm told--

02:49:27.271 --> 02:49:30.525
The final decision will,
of course, be Lord Antony's.

02:49:30.650 --> 02:49:35.947
And I'm sure that in time,
he will make it. That is all.

02:49:43.371 --> 02:49:48.751
It would be wiser, I think, not to
disagree in the presence of our officers.

02:49:48.835 --> 02:49:51.337
Your officers.

02:49:51.421 --> 02:49:54.549
And what final decision have
you decided I am to make?

02:49:54.590 --> 02:49:57.802
Why do you oppose transporting
our armies to Greece?

02:49:57.927 --> 02:50:00.388
Because I do not want war against Rome.

02:50:00.430 --> 02:50:03.850
One hundred thousand
men led by Marc Antony.

02:50:04.016 --> 02:50:07.019
Octavian is no fool. He won't fight.

02:50:07.145 --> 02:50:10.148
He won't want to. He'll have to,
instantly, on the spot where they land.

02:50:10.231 --> 02:50:13.317
Rome will not declare war against you.

02:50:13.401 --> 02:50:15.278
I do not agree.

02:50:15.361 --> 02:50:18.614
I have not asked for your opinion.

02:50:18.740 --> 02:50:22.827
Not for some time. Not since I
doubted the necessity of building...

02:50:22.994 --> 02:50:24.954
three hundred ships.

02:50:24.996 --> 02:50:27.331
The way to prevent war
is to be ready for it.

02:50:27.457 --> 02:50:31.836
Have 300 warships ever been
built for war without war?

02:50:32.003 --> 02:50:35.047
We shall have what we want without it.

02:50:35.214 --> 02:50:38.342
Your Majesty, please hear me.

02:50:38.426 --> 02:50:41.846
I think we are very near the edge.

02:50:42.013 --> 02:50:44.515
Strings are being pulled, and not by us.

02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:48.686
We are being manage dandmaneuvered
without our choosing.

02:50:48.770 --> 02:50:51.856
The deputation sent on
behalf of Lady Octavia,

02:50:52.023 --> 02:50:55.443
chosen from the most
highly revered men of Rome.

02:50:55.610 --> 02:50:58.654
Why? They can take
back to their people...

02:50:58.780 --> 02:51:00.782
nothing but
Lord Antony's--

02:51:00.865 --> 02:51:02.784
Forgive
me--

02:51:02.825 --> 02:51:08.206
insulting and unnecessary divorce
of her and his rejection of them.

02:51:10.458 --> 02:51:14.337
It was done at my bidding.
The responsibility is mine.

02:51:17.048 --> 02:51:19.258
The doing was mine.

02:51:22.053 --> 02:51:25.807
- What do you propose? - Let me go
to Rome. Let me approach Octavian--

02:51:25.807 --> 02:51:30.186
if possible, the Roman people--
and assure them that we want peace.

02:51:32.647 --> 02:51:36.067
Go then. Go to Rome.

02:51:48.830 --> 02:51:51.833
Sisogenes!

02:51:53.292 --> 02:51:55.211
Take care.

02:51:59.549 --> 02:52:01.968
He's very dear to you, that old man.

02:52:02.051 --> 02:52:04.929
Your concern and worry
are written all over you.

02:52:05.054 --> 02:52:08.641
Forgive me, but it's a kind
of love that you're showing.

02:52:08.808 --> 02:52:12.603
Let them talk. Let them
negotiate all they want.

02:52:12.645 --> 02:52:16.065
Time is on our side. We
can only grow stronger.

02:52:31.122 --> 02:52:33.958
These walls must not
believe their ears...

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.627
to hear such silence...

02:52:38.421 --> 02:52:41.340
from the right,

02:52:41.382 --> 02:52:44.260
from the left.

02:52:44.343 --> 02:52:47.805
The call of the Roman
people can be clearly heard,

02:52:47.847 --> 02:52:50.391
yet the Roman Senate...

02:52:50.433 --> 02:52:54.062
has no answer.

02:52:54.145 --> 02:52:58.357
Shall we then just sit...

02:52:58.399 --> 02:53:00.318
and listen?

02:53:00.401 --> 02:53:03.529
There is not one of us, August Caesar,

02:53:03.654 --> 02:53:06.240
that would not willingly
make war upon Cleopatra.

02:53:06.407 --> 02:53:08.618
But how...

02:53:08.826 --> 02:53:11.621
without also making
war upon Marc Antony,

02:53:11.788 --> 02:53:14.749
loved by Rome and loving Rome?

02:53:14.832 --> 02:53:19.670
" Loved by Rome and loving Rome."

02:53:19.796 --> 02:53:23.758
I have here the last
will and testament...

02:53:23.841 --> 02:53:27.220
of Antony, who so loved Rome.

02:53:29.931 --> 02:53:32.350
Read for your selves...

02:53:32.350 --> 02:53:36.187
how dearly Antony
loves you, loves Rome...

02:53:36.354 --> 02:53:40.525
in this, his last will under his seal.

02:53:43.152 --> 02:53:45.029
Only lately brought from Egypt...

02:53:45.196 --> 02:53:49.242
and deposited in our holy
temple at Antony's request...

02:53:49.409 --> 02:53:51.828
by the distinguished Sisogenes.

02:53:51.994 --> 02:53:55.415
An extraordinary mission
for an extraordinary man.

02:53:55.498 --> 02:53:59.836
So wise, so close to
Cleopatra, so trusted by her.

02:53:59.961 --> 02:54:03.589
Read in Antony's will...

02:54:03.631 --> 02:54:05.550
at the end.

02:54:05.717 --> 02:54:10.179
Commit to memory the last
request of your beloved Antony.

02:54:10.304 --> 02:54:14.183
It bears witness to his love for Rome.

02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:24.736
When he is dead, it says,

02:54:24.819 --> 02:54:28.448
when Marc Antony has died,

02:54:28.573 --> 02:54:32.076
it is his wish to be buried...

02:54:32.118 --> 02:54:36.038
in his beloved Alexandria!

02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:39.000
- In Egypt,

02:54:39.041 --> 02:54:41.586
among Egyptians,

02:54:41.753 --> 02:54:45.048
beside his Egyptian whore!

02:54:48.468 --> 02:54:51.137
Is what I say the truth?

02:54:51.220 --> 02:54:54.390
Do I speak the truth?

02:55:01.314 --> 02:55:03.608
- War!
- War!

02:55:41.979 --> 02:55:46.651
I hold before you the
Golden Spear of War,

02:55:46.776 --> 02:55:50.071
placed in to my hands without dissent...

02:55:50.196 --> 02:55:53.783
by the command and will
of the Senate of Rome.

02:55:53.950 --> 02:55:59.038
And now it is you, the people
of Rome, who must direct me.

02:55:59.247 --> 02:56:01.791
Where is the enemy?

02:56:01.999 --> 02:56:05.169
Where is Egypt? Show me the way!

02:56:13.636 --> 02:56:16.681
No! No!

02:56:16.848 --> 02:56:18.683
There!

02:56:18.808 --> 02:56:21.894
There is Egypt.

02:56:40.538 --> 02:56:44.709
And so once more, the Romans
warred upon each other.

02:56:44.834 --> 02:56:47.545
And just as Antony had foretold,

02:56:47.670 --> 02:56:50.214
the forces of Octavian
came to meet them...

02:56:50.006 --> 02:56:52.383
on the spot where they landed,

02:56:52.550 --> 02:56:56.804
which was at Actium, in Greece.

02:56:56.929 --> 02:56:59.599
The action will begin with
the rising of the sun tomorrow.

02:56:59.724 --> 02:57:01.601
Your battle plan is
very brave, very simple.

02:57:01.768 --> 02:57:05.396
You might bring it off on land, but there are a
hundred reasons to debate its wisdom on the sea.

02:57:05.563 --> 02:57:09.901
I have an enemy who faces me on land with
fewer troops, on sea with fewer ships.

02:57:10.026 --> 02:57:11.861
Let him debate the
wisdom of his position.

02:57:11.986 --> 02:57:16.407
I have a happy choice-- to destroy
him wet or dry. I have chosen wet.

02:57:18.659 --> 02:57:20.578
And I think it best, Euphranor,

02:57:20.661 --> 02:57:23.915
that you report to Queen Cleopatra
aboard her vessel in the harbor.

02:57:24.040 --> 02:57:26.000
There, if you like, you
may point out to her...

02:57:26.125 --> 02:57:30.588
the hundred reasons why my
brave simplicity has failed.

02:57:30.755 --> 02:57:34.008
In any case, you are relieved
of your battle command.

02:57:45.436 --> 02:57:49.774
This final commitment of yourself,
your ships, of all of us...

02:57:49.857 --> 02:57:51.943
to fight Octavian at sea;
when did you decide, my lord?

02:57:52.110 --> 02:57:53.945
Forgive me,
Rufio. I had--

02:57:54.112 --> 02:57:56.572
Canidius and I have worked
very hard for many months.

02:57:56.656 --> 02:57:58.866
We have organized and trained
an army of almost 200,000 men...

02:57:58.991 --> 02:58:00.868
from 20 different countries.

02:58:00.993 --> 02:58:04.580
- They will not be wasted-- - Of which,
tonight, some 20,000 foot soldiers and cavalry...

02:58:04.664 --> 02:58:06.624
will be herded and whipped
onto the decks of those ships,

02:58:06.749 --> 02:58:09.168
to be dragged out to sea
tomorrow, puking and afraid.

02:58:09.335 --> 02:58:13.172
- Why, my lord? Why?
- Because I have decided it will be so!

02:58:13.256 --> 02:58:15.758
I would consider it an honor...

02:58:15.842 --> 02:58:20.388
to fight beside Lord Antony
at any time, anywhere.

02:58:20.471 --> 02:58:22.473
Spoken like a Roman, Ramos.

02:58:24.392 --> 02:58:27.895
And you shall fight at
my side, in Rufio's place.

02:58:28.020 --> 02:58:32.150
Rufio, you will remain with
Her Majesty aboard her vessel.

02:58:34.360 --> 02:58:38.698
- As you command.
- Canidius, you will remain with the land forces,

02:58:38.865 --> 02:58:40.908
cheering from the hilltop, if you like.

02:58:42.827 --> 02:58:45.496
- As you command.
- Exactly.

02:58:45.663 --> 02:58:47.957
As I command.

02:58:50.835 --> 02:58:52.795
You're all dismissed.

02:59:10.730 --> 02:59:12.231
Antony.

02:59:15.401 --> 02:59:17.570
What has happened?

02:59:17.695 --> 02:59:20.782
To me?

02:59:20.990 --> 02:59:22.867
You have happened to me.

03:00:07.650 --> 03:00:10.194
Have our lookouts been
given Octavian's insignia?

03:00:10.278 --> 03:00:12.196
A golden eagle. We've had
it in sight since sunrise--

03:00:12.280 --> 03:00:14.615
By sunset we'll have
those gold feathers.

03:00:17.451 --> 03:00:19.453
Let Octavian know we are coming!

03:00:19.495 --> 03:00:24.250
Let the enemy hear the
voice of Antony's legions!

03:00:48.900 --> 03:00:53.696
He's on his way. Signal my Lord
Caesar's ship. Does it fly his insignia?

03:00:53.863 --> 03:00:56.449
My orders are to be
followed exactly as issued.

03:01:01.704 --> 03:01:06.125
And may the gods grant that Antony
has not changed his plan of battle.

03:01:12.465 --> 03:01:14.342
There he goes,

03:01:14.467 --> 03:01:18.596
as he's done a hundred times on
land-- straight for the center.

03:01:18.721 --> 03:01:23.267
If only it were on land, and we
were there to protect his flanks.

03:01:23.392 --> 03:01:25.228
But we're not.

03:01:29.148 --> 03:01:31.943
This and all other dispositions are
to be signaled to Admiral Euphranor...

03:01:32.109 --> 03:01:34.070
aboard Queen Cleopatra's barge.

03:01:34.237 --> 03:01:36.239
Euphranor! But surely
he's in command of--

03:01:36.280 --> 03:01:40.493
In command of moving toy
ships on a painted ocean...

03:01:40.660 --> 03:01:44.705
so that Egypt's queen can more
clearly follow her war upon water...

03:01:44.831 --> 03:01:48.209
to which she has committed
Marc Antony and 20,000 Romans.

03:01:58.344 --> 03:02:00.847
Just as he said he would.

03:02:01.013 --> 03:02:04.851
Lord Antony and his escorts have
moved out by themselves after Octavian.

03:02:04.934 --> 03:02:07.854
- He's already broken through their center.
- They let him through.

03:02:07.937 --> 03:02:09.897
The Roman line will close behind him.

03:02:10.106 --> 03:02:11.941
Not if we engage and
hold them, as Antony said.

03:02:12.066 --> 03:02:16.946
They won't engage. Agrippa will pull
them back and back, behind Antony,

03:02:17.113 --> 03:02:19.031
as Antony chases Octavian.

03:02:21.534 --> 03:02:23.536
What reports do you have?

03:02:23.536 --> 03:02:27.540
Lord Antony is already through the
center of the Roman line, Your Majesty.

03:02:29.792 --> 03:02:35.047
He is now deep within the Roman
fleet, in pursuit of Octavian.

03:02:46.642 --> 03:02:48.519
Faster! Faster!

03:03:00.406 --> 03:03:04.035
They've increased their own speed, my
lord. We're too heavy to catch them.

03:03:04.035 --> 03:03:06.621
Then we'll slow them down.

03:03:06.704 --> 03:03:09.874
Start the ballistas. Javelin throwers.

03:03:10.041 --> 03:03:12.835
Aim high. Overshoot rather than under.

03:03:17.423 --> 03:03:19.550
Ballistas. Javelins.

03:03:24.430 --> 03:03:26.349
Ballistas!

03:03:36.943 --> 03:03:41.948
Octavian's ships are so much
faster than our Egyptian tubs.

03:03:42.031 --> 03:03:45.076
Why doesn't Agrippa keep him
away from Antony's ballistas?

03:03:59.549 --> 03:04:01.509
Ballistas!

03:04:20.528 --> 03:04:22.488
Ballistas!

03:04:31.706 --> 03:04:34.250
Ballistas!

03:04:34.458 --> 03:04:37.128
My lord! My lord!

03:04:37.253 --> 03:04:40.256
A direct hit on the enemy. One
bank of oars has been destroyed.

03:04:43.843 --> 03:04:46.762
He's coming around broadside.

03:04:46.846 --> 03:04:49.307
We've got him. Collision course.

03:04:49.432 --> 03:04:52.685
We'll ram him, board and destroy him.

03:05:47.615 --> 03:05:49.534
Octavian!

03:05:52.495 --> 03:05:55.832
Octavian! No wis your
time to be a Caesar.

03:06:21.232 --> 03:06:25.361
- Where is he hiding?
- My Lord Octavian is not on board.

03:06:28.614 --> 03:06:31.534
And now we close the trap.

03:06:31.659 --> 03:06:35.079
Now we hit my Lord Antony
with everything we have.

03:06:57.393 --> 03:07:01.105
No word of Lord Antony? By
now he must have Octavian.

03:07:01.272 --> 03:07:03.065
You, yourself, said he
rammed Octavian's ship.

03:07:03.232 --> 03:07:07.111
It may be Lord Antony rammed a ship
flying Octavian's insignia, huh?

03:07:07.236 --> 03:07:10.531
But if it is Octavian's ship--
If Octavian is on board--

03:07:10.698 --> 03:07:13.242
And if Lord Antony
finds and kills Octavian,

03:07:13.284 --> 03:07:15.620
he is still surrounded
by half the Roman fleet.

03:07:15.745 --> 03:07:18.289
- Then send him help.
- I've none to send.

03:07:21.250 --> 03:07:24.504
They're pulling our ships apart now.

03:07:24.587 --> 03:07:27.089
They've got Antony alone and cut off,

03:07:27.256 --> 03:07:31.302
closing in on him like a pack
of dogs on a wounded bear.

03:08:52.554 --> 03:08:55.515
- Lord Antony's ship?
- Gone.

03:08:57.684 --> 03:09:00.562
- And Octavian's ship?
- Burning, helpless.

03:09:09.529 --> 03:09:12.365
Would you say, Admiral,

03:09:12.449 --> 03:09:15.702
that Lord Antony is dead?

03:09:27.547 --> 03:09:29.507
How is the wind for Egypt?

03:09:29.674 --> 03:09:31.468
Fair.

03:09:36.598 --> 03:09:39.142
We'll sail at once.

03:09:47.067 --> 03:09:49.069
Man the oar-banks. Hoist anchor.

03:09:49.194 --> 03:09:51.071
We sail for Egypt!

03:10:22.936 --> 03:10:24.896
My Lord Canidius!

03:10:40.704 --> 03:10:45.041
Remember always, that
after the battle of Actium,

03:10:45.166 --> 03:10:50.005
with Octavian dead and Antony dead,

03:10:50.088 --> 03:10:52.257
you saw the victor...

03:10:52.340 --> 03:10:56.136
sail away on her golden barge.

03:11:04.894 --> 03:11:08.481
She's going. Cleopatra's going!

03:11:13.945 --> 03:11:16.865
- Leaving me!
- My lord.

03:11:16.948 --> 03:11:20.744
My lord, our casualties are
heavy. We have little armor left.

03:11:20.869 --> 03:11:23.788
Our men need regrouping,
someone to give them courage.

03:11:23.830 --> 03:11:27.542
My lord, the dying are calling
for you. The living need your help.

03:11:27.584 --> 03:11:30.003
You can't leave them.

03:11:30.086 --> 03:11:32.047
Listen to me!

03:12:27.769 --> 03:12:30.980
Caesar, news! Great news!

03:12:30.906 --> 03:12:33.492
Cleopatra is leaving the
battle. Antony is following her.

03:12:33.658 --> 03:12:36.036
We have won a great victory.

03:12:45.879 --> 03:12:49.591
Weigh oars!

03:14:20.557 --> 03:14:24.728
Her Majesty is most anxious to
see you. Will you come below?

03:14:27.063 --> 03:14:29.566
Perhaps if you wish to remain
here, she will come to you.

03:14:31.693 --> 03:14:35.906
Shall I send you food? Wine?

03:14:40.994 --> 03:14:43.580
Her Majesty's orders.

03:14:43.705 --> 03:14:47.375
She's afraid you might... harm yourself.

03:16:31.271 --> 03:16:33.148
Please.

03:16:35.484 --> 03:16:40.489
Octavian has crossed
from Syria into Egypt.

03:16:40.572 --> 03:16:42.908
He can be here in a matter of weeks.

03:16:42.949 --> 03:16:46.536
There are two full legions
here in Alexandria...

03:16:46.661 --> 03:16:48.538
who have remained loyal to you.

03:16:48.622 --> 03:16:52.250
They and their officers...

03:16:52.375 --> 03:16:55.295
are waiting for you to command them.

03:16:55.378 --> 03:16:58.381
If not to me,

03:16:58.465 --> 03:17:00.675
won't you speak to Rufio at least...

03:17:00.842 --> 03:17:04.888
or to anyone you choose?

03:17:04.971 --> 03:17:09.309
Antony, just say what you
want done and it will be.

03:17:11.895 --> 03:17:16.274
It's been so long since you've
looked at me. Don't turn away,

03:17:16.316 --> 03:17:19.152
even like this,

03:17:19.236 --> 03:17:23.031
with your eyes filled with hate.

03:17:23.198 --> 03:17:25.116
How they burn with hate.

03:17:28.662 --> 03:17:30.705
Why, Antony? Why?

03:17:30.747 --> 03:17:33.708
Because I ran away?

03:17:33.792 --> 03:17:36.628
They told me you were dead!

03:17:39.965 --> 03:17:42.926
What... could I do?

03:17:44.886 --> 03:17:50.183
Where could I go... in a
world suddenly without you,

03:17:51.726 --> 03:17:55.063
except to my son and my country,

03:17:55.147 --> 03:17:58.024
Caesarion and Egypt?

03:17:58.150 --> 03:18:01.862
I wanted to save them from Octavian.

03:18:01.987 --> 03:18:04.906
You would have wanted me to go.

03:18:05.031 --> 03:18:06.908
You would have commanded me to go.

03:18:08.493 --> 03:18:10.996
Tell me you would have!

03:18:15.459 --> 03:18:18.378
They told me you were dead.

03:18:18.503 --> 03:18:22.883
They told me you were dead.

03:18:31.766 --> 03:18:33.977
You were quite right.

03:18:34.102 --> 03:18:36.438
I am dead.

03:19:07.469 --> 03:19:10.972
The armies of my Lord Caius Julius
Caesar are advancing even now,

03:19:10.972 --> 03:19:12.933
without opposition, upon Alexandria.

03:19:12.974 --> 03:19:15.685
Caius Julius Caesar?

03:19:15.727 --> 03:19:18.897
So now Octavian has
stolen all of the name.

03:19:19.022 --> 03:19:20.941
My Lord Caesar wishes it to be known...

03:19:21.107 --> 03:19:23.777
that he no longer has a
quarrel with Cleopatra of Egypt.

03:19:23.944 --> 03:19:27.322
Then let him take his armies
out of here and go home.

03:19:27.489 --> 03:19:32.786
He has charged me to say that the choice
of war or peace now rests with Egypt.

03:19:32.953 --> 03:19:36.331
And that for himself,
he desires only peace.

03:19:36.373 --> 03:19:41.461
And what are his terms for
this unconditional peace?

03:19:41.545 --> 03:19:45.465
A small token. A demonstration.

03:19:45.590 --> 03:19:51.096
A gesture. An indication of Queen
Cleopatra's good will and good faith.

03:19:51.179 --> 03:19:53.515
What does Octavian want?

03:19:53.682 --> 03:19:55.684
Marc Antony.

03:19:59.729 --> 03:20:03.483
The, uh, head of Marc Antony?

03:20:21.084 --> 03:20:24.504
Take this to him as my answer.

03:20:26.173 --> 03:20:28.675
Egyptian generosity.

03:20:28.884 --> 03:20:32.554
Octavian may have two
heads for the price of one.

03:20:32.679 --> 03:20:36.516
Either two... or none.

03:21:24.378 --> 03:21:26.964
I've been told you come here to sleep.

03:21:28.590 --> 03:21:32.761
- Not to sleep.
- To pass the night then.

03:21:32.845 --> 03:21:34.805
I'm not alone.

03:21:34.888 --> 03:21:39.977
The, uh-- The old boy and
I exchange memories of life.

03:21:40.144 --> 03:21:43.647
It's like having a roommate,
or should I say... tomb-mate?

03:21:43.772 --> 03:21:48.652
If he were in your place, would I find
Caesar here, do you think, hidden away,

03:21:48.736 --> 03:21:51.864
wrapped in moonlight
and end less self-pity?

03:21:51.947 --> 03:21:55.034
Self-pity again! You repeat
yourself! Find new reproaches for me.

03:21:55.075 --> 03:21:58.579
Until now it has just been
a part of your being drunk.

03:21:58.662 --> 03:22:00.748
Singing sad songs for Antony.

03:22:00.831 --> 03:22:04.835
Your time would be better spent, it
seems to me, negotiating with Octavian.

03:22:06.795 --> 03:22:10.049
Why did you not give my head to Agrippa?
 It would be no great loss to me.

03:22:10.132 --> 03:22:12.009
Dying the second time
is painless, they say,

03:22:12.051 --> 03:22:14.136
and possibly a great advantage to you,

03:22:14.178 --> 03:22:16.972
the basis, perhaps, of a
great new alliance with Rome.

03:22:17.056 --> 03:22:21.352
- I do not want a great new alliance with Rome.
- Then what do you want?

03:22:23.395 --> 03:22:25.647
I have come for Marc Antony.

03:22:25.731 --> 03:22:28.692
What is left of his
army, Rufio, my son and I,

03:22:28.776 --> 03:22:32.071
all of Egypt are waiting for him.

03:22:32.154 --> 03:22:34.865
There is little time.

03:22:34.990 --> 03:22:37.826
Marc Antony?

03:22:37.993 --> 03:22:42.956
There is no one here
by that name... alive.

03:23:02.184 --> 03:23:04.144
Time for what?

03:23:05.562 --> 03:23:08.440
For Marc Antony to
appear in shiny armor,

03:23:08.482 --> 03:23:10.609
swords flashing in both hands?

03:23:10.776 --> 03:23:12.945
Pfft, Agrippa. Pfft, Octavian.

03:23:13.028 --> 03:23:17.241
Stand back! Rejoice! Marc
Antony will save the day!

03:23:24.039 --> 03:23:26.083
Antony, you say?

03:23:26.250 --> 03:23:30.921
He died at Actium, running away.

03:23:31.088 --> 03:23:34.925
He tried to run on the water, the story
goes, but you were not there to hold his hand.

03:23:41.598 --> 03:23:45.561
Rufio, my legions, waiting.

03:23:45.769 --> 03:23:47.646
For what?

03:23:47.771 --> 03:23:51.650
To ask of me what they carry in their eyes,
in their hearts, in their sleep at night...

03:23:51.775 --> 03:23:53.610
as I have in mine.

03:23:53.777 --> 03:23:56.488
Why are you not dead?

03:23:56.613 --> 03:23:58.449
Why do you live? How can you live?

03:23:58.574 --> 03:24:01.827
Why do you not lie in the
deepest hole of the sea,

03:24:01.952 --> 03:24:05.748
bloodless and bloated and at
peace with honorable death?

03:24:13.881 --> 03:24:18.427
You... begged forgiveness
from me for running away.

03:24:18.594 --> 03:24:22.431
You wept and gave your reason. A mother
to her child, a queen to her country.

03:24:22.556 --> 03:24:25.434
Where and how can I weep
and beg? From whom?

03:24:25.642 --> 03:24:29.188
The thousands and thousands
who can no longer hear me?

03:24:31.857 --> 03:24:34.318
Shall I give my reason?

03:24:34.485 --> 03:24:37.363
Shall I say simply... I loved?

03:24:39.281 --> 03:24:43.869
When I saw you go, I saw nothing-- felt,
heard, thought nothing except your going.

03:24:43.994 --> 03:24:46.830
Not the dying and dead,
not Rome, not Egypt,

03:24:46.872 --> 03:24:50.000
not victory or defeat, honor or
disgrace, friend, enemy, future or past,

03:24:50.167 --> 03:24:53.212
only that my love was going
and that I must be with her.

03:24:53.379 --> 03:24:55.839
That my love, my master called.

03:24:56.048 --> 03:24:58.175
And I followed.

03:24:58.258 --> 03:25:00.969
And that only then,

03:25:01.053 --> 03:25:03.972
I looked back...

03:25:04.056 --> 03:25:05.933
and I saw.

03:25:18.195 --> 03:25:20.072
How right you were.

03:25:20.197 --> 03:25:26.036
" Have as your master
anyone, anything...

03:25:26.161 --> 03:25:28.163
but never love."

03:25:28.247 --> 03:25:31.458
How
wrong--

03:25:31.583 --> 03:25:34.753
How wrong I was.

03:25:34.878 --> 03:25:38.632
Antony, the love you followed is here.

03:25:38.757 --> 03:25:42.010
To be had upon payment of an empire.

03:25:42.052 --> 03:25:44.722
Without you, Antony,

03:25:44.888 --> 03:25:47.474
this is not a world I want to live in,

03:25:47.558 --> 03:25:51.478
much less conquer.

03:25:51.603 --> 03:25:54.773
Because for me...

03:25:54.898 --> 03:25:58.110
there would be no love anywhere.

03:26:00.279 --> 03:26:03.615
Do you want me to die with you? I will.

03:26:05.159 --> 03:26:07.828
Or do you want me to live with you?

03:26:10.080 --> 03:26:11.999
What ever you choose.

03:26:26.138 --> 03:26:30.351
Are we too late, do you
think, if we choose to live?

03:26:30.476 --> 03:26:33.062
Better too late...

03:26:33.187 --> 03:26:35.481
than never.

03:27:34.623 --> 03:27:37.960
My lady, there is disturbing
news from the city.

03:27:38.085 --> 03:27:42.423
The people are frightened. Some
are beginning to leave their homes.

03:27:42.423 --> 03:27:46.385
During the night, hundreds of notices
were secretly posted everywhere.

03:27:46.427 --> 03:27:49.179
They were found this morning
stuck up in the marketplace,

03:27:49.346 --> 03:27:52.474
even painted on the walls of
temples and other holy places.

03:27:52.599 --> 03:27:57.896
Signed by Octavian Caius
Julius Caesar Augustus,

03:27:57.980 --> 03:28:02.067
promising the Egyptian people
peace if they surrender to him...

03:28:02.234 --> 03:28:04.069
and destruction if they do not.

03:28:04.278 --> 03:28:06.572
I've had all of the notices removed...

03:28:06.780 --> 03:28:09.825
and I've ordered the death penalty for
anyone who spreads the false rumors...

03:28:09.950 --> 03:28:12.369
that Lord Antony's men might desert him.

03:28:12.453 --> 03:28:17.374
And what penalty if the
rumors might come true?

03:28:18.959 --> 03:28:20.836
How do you know?

03:28:20.961 --> 03:28:23.088
I know the Romans.

03:28:23.130 --> 03:28:26.508
There is only one commander
they will never desert.

03:28:26.633 --> 03:28:29.219
His name... is Victory.

03:28:29.219 --> 03:28:33.432
But yet,just now, you
let Lord Antony go as if--

03:28:38.645 --> 03:28:42.566
If you could have seen
him, how proud he was,

03:28:42.649 --> 03:28:44.526
unafraid,

03:28:46.195 --> 03:28:48.781
as he used to be.

03:28:48.947 --> 03:28:50.824
All of my
attendants--

03:28:50.949 --> 03:28:53.577
Have they been given their
freedom? Have they gone?

03:28:53.660 --> 03:28:56.789
Yes. They wanted once more to tidy up.

03:28:56.830 --> 03:28:59.833
Octavian can do his own house cleaning.

03:28:59.875 --> 03:29:03.921
The captain of the guards and three of
his best men are to report to me at once,

03:29:04.046 --> 03:29:06.173
disguised as merchants.

03:29:06.173 --> 03:29:10.302
They are to escort
Caesarion out of Egypt,

03:29:10.386 --> 03:29:12.971
for the time being.

03:29:13.138 --> 03:29:17.184
And you? Your Majesty,
please reconsider.

03:29:17.393 --> 03:29:20.646
There are two of Euphranor's ships,
very fast, in the East Harbor.

03:29:20.813 --> 03:29:24.608
And would you roll me
on board in a carpet?

03:29:24.775 --> 03:29:26.652
No.

03:29:26.735 --> 03:29:31.281
There are no more Caesars to
go to, at least not for me.

03:29:31.407 --> 03:29:35.869
- Then it is still your intention
to-- - To remain in Alexandria.

03:29:36.036 --> 03:29:40.082
In the last possible
place anyone would look.

03:29:40.165 --> 03:29:44.294
Literally, the last possible place.

03:29:44.378 --> 03:29:49.591
- Your Majesty, I have never questioned your decisions.
- This is not the time to begin.

03:29:49.758 --> 03:29:54.388
- Let me stay with you.
- Charmian and Eiras will look after me.

03:29:54.555 --> 03:29:56.432
If Lord
Antony should--

03:29:58.475 --> 03:30:01.729
When Lord Antony returns,

03:30:01.812 --> 03:30:04.982
you will be here to tell
him where to find me...

03:30:05.065 --> 03:30:07.735
waiting for him.

03:30:07.818 --> 03:30:12.364
Together, we will then
do... what he thinks best.

03:30:12.531 --> 03:30:14.366
Is that clear?

03:30:17.369 --> 03:30:21.331
- Yes, my lady.
- Was there anything more?

03:30:23.167 --> 03:30:25.085
I have always loved you.

03:30:26.670 --> 03:30:28.797
And I have always known.

03:30:41.193 --> 03:30:43.529
Rome has never known such an army.

03:30:43.696 --> 03:30:46.073
We should be taking on the
combined powers of Asia.

03:30:46.198 --> 03:30:49.493
It seems almost a waste of time to
slaughter what's left of Antony's army...

03:30:49.577 --> 03:30:52.079
- and what's left of Antony.
- There will be no slaughter.

03:30:52.163 --> 03:30:54.665
I doubt there will be even bloodshed.

03:30:54.790 --> 03:30:59.545
Has a battle ever been won without
a blow being struck? I wonder.

03:30:59.670 --> 03:31:03.007
At any rate, let me
make it clear once more.

03:31:03.174 --> 03:31:06.844
I want Antony alive,
and I want her alive.

03:31:07.011 --> 03:31:09.680
She must be taken alive.

03:31:12.725 --> 03:31:18.439
Queen Cleopatra's second procession
into Rome will surpass her first.

03:31:31.035 --> 03:31:34.538
The ring your father gave you,

03:31:34.622 --> 03:31:38.876
it is yours now... to keep.

03:31:38.959 --> 03:31:43.339
Wear it with pride and with honor.

03:31:43.380 --> 03:31:47.426
I'm afraid. I know I shouldn't be.

03:31:47.468 --> 03:31:49.845
Who told you that?

03:31:49.929 --> 03:31:55.059
All kings and especially
queens are afraid.

03:31:55.142 --> 03:31:58.229
They just manage not to show it,

03:31:58.395 --> 03:32:01.357
something ordinary people cannot do.

03:32:59.039 --> 03:33:03.252
Hail... Antony!

03:33:25.483 --> 03:33:28.861
- How near is Octavian?
- Very near. Over that low ridge.

03:33:29.028 --> 03:33:32.573
As it grows darker, the glow from
his campfires will light up the sky.

03:33:38.078 --> 03:33:41.457
Our troops must find
it attractive to watch.

03:33:41.582 --> 03:33:43.959
Inviting, even.

03:33:44.084 --> 03:33:47.254
Antony's legions warm
themselves at their own fires.

03:33:47.379 --> 03:33:52.218
Yes. I could feel the
warmth as I rode by.

03:33:54.053 --> 03:33:56.055
- How many legions has he?
- Twenty.

03:33:56.138 --> 03:33:59.058
- And we? - Two. The 1
2th and one made up from--

03:33:59.225 --> 03:34:01.810
Made up from what was
left of the others.

03:34:01.852 --> 03:34:06.732
As I remember it, Caesar
held Alexandria with two.

03:34:10.152 --> 03:34:12.404
How are they deployed? Rufio.

03:34:16.033 --> 03:34:20.788
Cavalry to the left, cavalry to
the right, infantry to the center.

03:34:20.871 --> 03:34:25.835
Three elephants deployed
to stamp out a fly.

03:34:25.960 --> 03:34:29.255
My lords Octavian and Agrippa have
all the strategic brilliance...

03:34:29.421 --> 03:34:32.925
of two vestal virgins.

03:34:33.050 --> 03:34:34.468
We can draw back here to softer
ground, too soft for cavalry,

03:34:34.468 --> 03:34:35.845
We can draw back here to softer
ground, too soft for cavalry,

03:34:35.970 --> 03:34:37.847
and make our stand
against their infantry.

03:34:37.930 --> 03:34:42.476
Stand? And let them stamp on us?
No. Let the elephants stand.

03:34:42.476 --> 03:34:45.688
We flies will bite and buzz and tickle.

03:34:45.771 --> 03:34:48.232
At the first light of day...

03:34:48.357 --> 03:34:51.944
while Octavian's glow
still lights up the sky,

03:34:52.111 --> 03:34:53.988
we will attack.

03:34:57.199 --> 03:35:00.244
By sunset both our loyal
legions will have grown larger...

03:35:00.369 --> 03:35:02.580
and even more loyal, I promise you.

03:35:04.582 --> 03:35:06.458
Good night.

03:35:15.467 --> 03:35:18.429
Rufio, tell the guards, please,

03:35:18.554 --> 03:35:22.224
- I am to be awakened just before dawn.
- Of course.

03:35:22.391 --> 03:35:24.268
And, Rufio,

03:35:24.435 --> 03:35:30.149
if, for whatever reason, the guards
should forget or misjudge the time,

03:35:30.232 --> 03:35:32.234
will you, yourself, wake me?

03:35:32.401 --> 03:35:35.196
The guards will wake you.

03:35:37.031 --> 03:35:40.075
- But if they don't?
- Then I will. Never fear.

03:35:40.201 --> 03:35:42.536
I never fear.

03:35:48.334 --> 03:35:50.252
Not anymore.

03:36:49.478 --> 03:36:51.397
Rufio!

03:38:05.054 --> 03:38:06.972
Rufio.

03:40:29.435 --> 03:40:31.437
Fight!

03:40:32.605 --> 03:40:34.982
Fight!

03:40:40.822 --> 03:40:42.573
Fight!

03:40:42.698 --> 03:40:45.368
Fight! Fight!

03:40:47.495 --> 03:40:49.956
Why don't you fight?

03:41:14.522 --> 03:41:20.236
Is there no one who would grant
Antony an honorable way to die?

03:41:42.633 --> 03:41:44.927
Before me,

03:41:45.011 --> 03:41:49.807
this was carried by another
Roman killed by Rome.

03:41:49.974 --> 03:41:52.351
Another...

03:41:52.435 --> 03:41:54.812
Caesar.

03:42:03.488 --> 03:42:05.948
No.

03:42:05.990 --> 03:42:08.951
We will have him.

03:42:08.993 --> 03:42:11.954
We will have them both together.

03:43:52.764 --> 03:43:55.516
Where is she?

03:43:55.600 --> 03:43:57.435
Where is she?

03:43:59.228 --> 03:44:01.355
Her Majesty said to tell you...

03:44:01.397 --> 03:44:05.610
she can be found in the last
possible place anyone would look.

03:44:08.237 --> 03:44:11.240
Literally, the last possible place.

03:44:16.996 --> 03:44:18.915
She might have waited.

03:44:18.998 --> 03:44:21.793
Once more, it seems,

03:44:21.959 --> 03:44:25.922
Cleopatra is out of reach...

03:44:26.047 --> 03:44:29.342
and I must hurry after.

03:44:29.425 --> 03:44:31.594
Throughout life...

03:44:31.803 --> 03:44:33.596
and now beyond.

03:44:33.763 --> 03:44:37.767
One woman, one love!

03:44:41.104 --> 03:44:43.606
Nothing changes,

03:44:43.648 --> 03:44:45.942
except life into death.

03:44:55.034 --> 03:44:56.953
Will you help me?

03:45:02.417 --> 03:45:08.089
- Help me to die, Apollodorus!
- I want to! But I can't.

03:45:24.021 --> 03:45:28.151
I've always envied Rufio his...

03:45:28.192 --> 03:45:30.111
long arms.

03:45:48.337 --> 03:45:51.049
The ultimate
desertion--

03:45:51.132 --> 03:45:53.593
I from myself.

03:45:53.718 --> 03:45:58.306
Else how could I have missed what
I must have aimed for all my life?

03:45:59.932 --> 03:46:01.809
Will you finish me now?

03:46:03.227 --> 03:46:07.398
Where is my sword? I
beg you to finish me.

03:46:07.523 --> 03:46:10.193
I lied to you. I let you
think the queen is dead.

03:46:10.359 --> 03:46:12.820
But she's alive in her
tomb, waiting for you.

03:46:15.615 --> 03:46:18.117
Cleopatra waiting?

03:46:18.201 --> 03:46:20.828
There will be...

03:46:20.953 --> 03:46:22.955
just enough time...

03:46:23.039 --> 03:46:24.999
if you'll help me.

03:47:24.976 --> 03:47:28.438
Perhaps, my lady, if we were
to bind his wounds tightly--

03:47:28.521 --> 03:47:32.942
It would only give him
pain. Let him sleep.

03:47:45.204 --> 03:47:47.123
Sleep.

03:47:47.206 --> 03:47:50.376
Will you come tonight...

03:47:50.460 --> 03:47:52.795
so that I can sleep...

03:47:54.464 --> 03:47:56.340
the dark sleep?

03:47:59.719 --> 03:48:02.555
They did meet, after all,

03:48:02.638 --> 03:48:04.515
the lovers.

03:48:04.599 --> 03:48:06.976
They will always meet.

03:48:08.603 --> 03:48:11.606
Be lonely for me.

03:48:11.647 --> 03:48:15.651
But not for very long, I promise.

03:48:18.237 --> 03:48:21.199
I thought always I would die...

03:48:21.365 --> 03:48:24.243
so well...

03:48:24.368 --> 03:48:26.829
as becomes
a soldier--

03:48:29.248 --> 03:48:31.375
a soldier's death.

03:48:33.044 --> 03:48:35.588
I lived always as I saw fit.

03:48:38.758 --> 03:48:41.302
Unfittingly.

03:48:41.344 --> 03:48:45.390
I would make it up, I thought, in death.

03:48:45.556 --> 03:48:47.642
I
expected--

03:48:47.809 --> 03:48:51.145
I expected too much of me in death,

03:48:51.187 --> 03:48:54.065
as in life.

03:48:54.190 --> 03:48:56.651
Are you holding me?

03:48:56.776 --> 03:48:59.278
Never so closely.

03:48:59.445 --> 03:49:01.406
Even closer.

03:49:03.991 --> 03:49:06.744
You and I will prove death...

03:49:06.911 --> 03:49:09.372
so much less than love.

03:49:11.624 --> 03:49:13.960
You and I,
we will--

03:49:14.168 --> 03:49:16.796
we'll make of dying...

03:49:16.963 --> 03:49:20.133
nothing more than one...

03:49:20.258 --> 03:49:22.802
last...

03:49:23.010 --> 03:49:24.846
embrace.

03:49:30.059 --> 03:49:33.062
A kiss...

03:49:33.187 --> 03:49:36.441
to take my breath away.

03:49:56.836 --> 03:49:59.714
There has never been...

03:49:59.797 --> 03:50:02.008
such a silence.

03:50:46.836 --> 03:50:48.713
Turn him over.

03:50:54.969 --> 03:50:59.057
Strange people. Poisons
that smell like perfume.

03:50:59.140 --> 03:51:03.228
See if you can find more. Have it analyzed.
Test it on one of the badly wounded.

03:51:09.317 --> 03:51:12.445
My lord, they have
found Queen Cleopatra.

03:51:12.529 --> 03:51:15.198
She is locked in a building,
that is to say, a tomb.

03:51:15.365 --> 03:51:17.242
Hurry.

03:51:22.747 --> 03:51:26.668
Oh, Marc Antony is with
her, they say. He's dead.

03:51:29.379 --> 03:51:32.132
- What?
- Lord Antony is dead.

03:51:34.509 --> 03:51:38.054
Is that how one says it?

03:51:38.221 --> 03:51:41.641
As simply as that.

03:51:41.766 --> 03:51:43.893
"Marc Antony is dead."

03:51:45.520 --> 03:51:47.522
"Lord Antony is dead."

03:51:49.941 --> 03:51:53.528
"The soup is hot. The soup is cold."

03:51:53.736 --> 03:51:57.198
"Antony is living. Antony is dead."

03:51:59.617 --> 03:52:03.246
Shake with terror when
such words pass your lips,

03:52:03.371 --> 03:52:07.625
for fear they be untrue and Antony
cut out your tongue for the lie.

03:52:07.751 --> 03:52:09.711
And if true,

03:52:09.836 --> 03:52:12.130
for your lifetime boast...

03:52:12.255 --> 03:52:16.760
that you were honored to
speak his name even in death.

03:52:16.885 --> 03:52:19.763
The dying of such a man...

03:52:19.888 --> 03:52:22.432
must be shouted,

03:52:22.515 --> 03:52:24.809
screamed.

03:52:24.934 --> 03:52:30.023
It must echo back from the
corners of the universe.

03:52:30.106 --> 03:52:32.692
Antony is dead!

03:52:32.817 --> 03:52:35.653
Marc Antony of Rome...

03:52:35.737 --> 03:52:37.405
lives no more!

03:52:59.908 --> 03:53:02.360
You need not to lower your head
before Caesar.

03:53:03.170 --> 03:53:04.319
I never did.

03:53:05.700 --> 03:53:07.408
But if he was here, I would be happy to

03:53:08.180 --> 03:53:10.227
I am Caesar.

03:53:10.944 --> 03:53:13.196
If it pleases you, Octavian.

03:53:14.329 --> 03:53:15.847
Look at me!

03:53:16.430 --> 03:53:17.569
If it pleases you

03:53:21.440 --> 03:53:24.082
After all this time and all what has happened,

03:53:24.990 --> 03:53:27.083
I suppose you are still beautiful.

03:53:28.085 --> 03:53:29.400
In a way.

03:53:29.670 --> 03:53:30.401
You flatter me.

03:53:31.185 --> 03:53:33.125
My interest is inpersonal.

03:53:33.375 --> 03:53:36.854
Should you have any intention -
Now you flatter yourself.

03:53:37.115 --> 03:53:38.855
The fighting is over.

03:53:39.680 --> 03:53:43.700
Your country, your possessions and you
 are mine by right of conquest.

03:53:43.721 --> 03:53:47.670
I will permit you to rule Egypt as an Roman
 province and return your possessions.

03:53:48.710 --> 03:53:51.975
There is one condition.
You will first accompany me to Rome.

03:53:54.015 --> 03:53:57.113
Behind your (cherried?) -
Look at me!

03:54:03.970 --> 03:54:07.911
Would the proud citizins of Rome wait for 
hours in the hot sun,

03:54:08.047 --> 03:54:11.467
to see my dead body
dragged through the Forum?

03:54:11.550 --> 03:54:13.427
I will have you closely watched.

03:54:15.554 --> 03:54:17.473
Octavian,

03:54:17.640 --> 03:54:21.352
when I am ready to die,

03:54:21.519 --> 03:54:24.772
I will die.

03:54:36.701 --> 03:54:39.245
And what if I promised
no harm will come to you,

03:54:39.453 --> 03:54:41.706
that you will be returned
safely to Alexandria?

03:54:41.831 --> 03:54:44.667
Look at me!

03:54:46.752 --> 03:54:48.671
What more could you ask?

03:54:53.050 --> 03:54:56.012
You have not spoken of my son.

03:54:56.137 --> 03:54:58.681
Your son?

03:54:58.889 --> 03:55:01.142
I'd forgotten him. Where is he?

03:55:01.308 --> 03:55:03.936
Safe.

03:55:06.605 --> 03:55:10.693
If I go with you to Rome,

03:55:10.860 --> 03:55:13.487
would you permit my son to rule Egypt?

03:55:13.654 --> 03:55:17.450
And his sons? And theirs?

03:55:17.533 --> 03:55:19.869
I will do everything I can.

03:55:19.952 --> 03:55:25.207
Do I have your word as
a Roman emperor and god?

03:55:28.044 --> 03:55:29.879
Yes.

03:55:32.089 --> 03:55:35.676
- When will you require me to go?
- As soon as possible.

03:55:38.429 --> 03:55:43.225
At the moment I am very tired and would
like to rest. If you will leave me now.

03:55:43.351 --> 03:55:45.603
Do I have your word...

03:55:45.770 --> 03:55:49.315
that you will not harm
yourself in anyway?

03:55:49.482 --> 03:55:52.276
I swear it...

03:55:54.362 --> 03:55:56.447
on the life of my son.

03:56:06.749 --> 03:56:09.043
Must the guards remain inside?

03:56:09.210 --> 03:56:14.048
I have sworn, after all,

03:56:14.215 --> 03:56:17.468
on the life of my son.

03:56:28.104 --> 03:56:32.692
- And now I must make ready to go.
- There's little to do.

03:56:34.151 --> 03:56:38.197
First I shall want something to eat.

03:56:38.406 --> 03:56:41.701
Something to sustain me on my way.

03:56:41.784 --> 03:56:45.121
- Some fruit perhaps?
- Bring it to me.

03:56:47.540 --> 03:56:49.458
Charmian.

03:56:52.837 --> 03:56:55.506
You then, Eiras.

03:56:55.548 --> 03:57:00.845
You have never been without
us. You cannot leave us behind.

03:57:02.513 --> 03:57:04.682
Perhaps...

03:57:04.849 --> 03:57:08.144
there may be enough for us all.

03:57:08.310 --> 03:57:10.604
Bring me a tablet to write on.

03:57:10.730 --> 03:57:12.815
I shall want a message
brought to Octavian.

03:57:13.024 --> 03:57:15.818
Words are wasted on such a man.

03:57:15.901 --> 03:57:19.655
I've wasted so many on so many men.

03:57:19.822 --> 03:57:22.908
A few more, one last request.

03:57:23.034 --> 03:57:25.494
Will he grant it, do you think?

03:57:25.661 --> 03:57:27.538
I may never know.

03:57:30.624 --> 03:57:33.502
But in this case,

03:57:33.711 --> 03:57:35.504
I think I shall.

03:57:44.013 --> 03:57:46.849
I will serve Her Majesty as always.

03:57:47.058 --> 03:57:48.851
It is I who have always served her.

03:57:49.060 --> 03:57:51.312
You will both wait...

03:57:51.437 --> 03:57:54.857
to dress me for my travels.

03:57:54.940 --> 03:57:58.069
I will
wear--

03:57:58.152 --> 03:58:01.072
I want to be as Antony first saw me.

03:58:01.238 --> 03:58:05.659
- The dress of gold.
- He must know at once,

03:58:05.701 --> 03:58:09.246
even from a great distance,

03:58:09.330 --> 03:58:11.624
that it is I.

03:58:11.749 --> 03:58:14.710
This will be the last thing you do.

03:58:14.877 --> 03:58:18.214
Drop this to one of the
guards outside for Octavian.

03:58:19.882 --> 03:58:21.717
But be sure to wait.

03:58:41.654 --> 03:58:45.533
Now let me see if the
figs are as they should be.

03:59:13.269 --> 03:59:16.147
The taste of these,
they say, is sharp...

03:59:16.313 --> 03:59:18.274
and swiftly over.

03:59:23.988 --> 03:59:27.742
How strangely awake I feel,

03:59:27.825 --> 03:59:31.120
as if living had been just a long dream.

03:59:33.164 --> 03:59:35.708
Someone else's dream,

03:59:35.833 --> 03:59:38.753
now finished at last.

03:59:44.717 --> 03:59:46.802
But now...

03:59:46.844 --> 03:59:49.847
will begin...

03:59:49.889 --> 03:59:52.475
a dream of my own...

03:59:54.310 --> 03:59:56.520
which will never end.

03:59:59.899 --> 04:00:01.692
Antony.

04:00:04.904 --> 04:00:06.739
Antony, wait.

04:00:20.836 --> 04:00:23.422
From the Egyptian queen, my
lord. A message for Caesar.

04:00:23.547 --> 04:00:28.052
Read it, Agrippa. Whatever she wants
will be granted upon her arrival in Rome.

04:00:28.094 --> 04:00:32.139
We will discuss it as she
walks beside my chariot.

04:00:32.306 --> 04:00:34.225
What is it?

04:00:34.350 --> 04:00:37.186
"My one wish, which I
implore you to grant,

04:00:37.353 --> 04:00:39.689
is to be buried at the side of Antony...

04:00:39.814 --> 04:00:43.067
and to remain there
until all things end."

04:01:37.288 --> 04:01:39.623
Was this well done of your lady?

04:01:42.251 --> 04:01:44.628
Extremely well,

04:01:44.712 --> 04:01:46.756
as be fitting...

04:01:46.839 --> 04:01:50.384
the last of so many noble...

04:01:50.468 --> 04:01:52.345
rulers.

04:01:57.725 --> 04:01:59.685
And the Roman asked,

04:02:01.312 --> 04:02:04.690
"Was this well done of your lady?"

04:02:10.196 --> 04:02:15.659
