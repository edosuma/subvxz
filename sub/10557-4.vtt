01:08.908 --> 01:11.067
What the bloody hell...

01:11.187 --> 01:14.187
Sir, you want to see this.
The man is quite remarkable.

01:14.187 --> 01:16.255
Murdoch, you're watching
this? It's like some circus.

01:16.266 --> 01:18.708
It's harmless, Sir. And the
men seem to be enjoying it.

01:18.708 --> 01:19.890
Do we know who the bloody hell he is?

01:19.908 --> 01:21.907
Harry Houdini, King of Escape.

01:21.952 --> 01:25.642
Inspector Thomas Brackenreid,
King of Station 4.

01:25.762 --> 01:27.893
I knew you were a clever
man the moment I saw you.

01:28.013 --> 01:32.180
Yes, well... yes. What can we do for you?

01:32.189 --> 01:34.080
Actually, it's what I can do for you, Sir.

01:34.168 --> 01:35.897
The Toronto Constabulary and guests

01:35.925 --> 01:38.158
are cordially invited to
witness incredible feats

01:38.171 --> 01:39.713
performed by The Houdini Brothers.

01:39.731 --> 01:42.317
Tonight at the Shaftsbury Theatre.

01:42.437 --> 01:43.773
I suppose I could find the time.

01:43.893 --> 01:45.899
I'm sure you'll find it most entertaining.

01:46.019 --> 01:47.463
What next gentlemen?

01:47.583 --> 01:49.706
Handcuffs!

01:53.150 --> 01:54.235
What?

01:54.561 --> 01:57.906
I'm not going to turn down
the offer of a free show.

01:58.026 --> 01:59.218
And neither are you.

01:59.263 --> 02:01.949
You need to get out more.
And so does Dr. Ogden.

02:03.368 --> 02:05.014
All right.

02:21.337 --> 02:25.415
And now, Leopold, you must
listen to Harry Houdini,

02:25.461 --> 02:28.978
think light thoughts... and float.

02:36.067 --> 02:38.816
Oh!

02:40.752 --> 02:42.967
I wonder if he's employing
the use of mirrors.

02:43.012 --> 02:45.174
Oh William, don't ruin it.

02:48.863 --> 02:50.581
Oh!

02:50.701 --> 02:52.715
He's very good.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.770
Wait, what's this?!

02:59.091 --> 03:01.361
Oh!

03:04.888 --> 03:07.329
Miss Ruby, the Temptress of Mystery.

03:07.338 --> 03:08.622
Oh my goodness!

03:08.640 --> 03:11.443
Yes, that is quite an entrance.

03:14.011 --> 03:16.100
It certainly is.

03:19.175 --> 03:21.209
Miss Ruby, will you lend a hand?

03:21.329 --> 03:23.452
And now, good people,

03:23.479 --> 03:25.731
for the Houdini Brothers' greatest escape.

03:26.029 --> 03:27.648
Oh!

04:02.381 --> 04:04.606
My brother has eleven minutes
to escape from this vault

04:04.633 --> 04:09.127
or he will run out of oxygen
and die. Starting... now!

04:54.045 --> 04:56.089
It's been nearly 11 minutes

04:56.098 --> 04:58.630
and still no sign of my brother.

05:13.289 --> 05:14.990
He's not gonna make it.

05:15.658 --> 05:17.486
Ladies and gentlemen!

05:27.614 --> 05:30.625
Hail the greatest escape
artist of our time!

05:32.153 --> 05:34.685
Help! Help!

05:35.174 --> 05:38.186
The bank's been robbed and I
think somebody's been killed.

05:39.126 --> 05:41.269
And it was you who done it.

05:52.745 --> 05:55.195
Walk this way sunshine
because I want some answers!

05:55.232 --> 05:57.303
We've got one dead man
and an empty bank vault.

05:57.321 --> 06:00.034
Plus an eyewitness who claims to have
seen you fleeing the scene of the crime.

06:00.052 --> 06:02.936
- That is unfortunate, isn't it?
- Extracting the Michael?

06:03.280 --> 06:05.179
- Excuse me?
- Do you think you can make

06:05.224 --> 06:07.051
a fool of the Toronto Constabulary?

06:07.096 --> 06:09.167
Dear Sir, to whom do you
think you're speaking?

06:09.203 --> 06:10.588
To the smart ass

06:10.597 --> 06:12.487
who pulled off tonight's
bank robbery and killed a man.

06:12.523 --> 06:14.657
You and probably that brother of yours.

06:14.777 --> 06:16.846
But Sirs, you yourselves are witnesses

06:16.846 --> 06:19.016
to the fact that we were
on stage the entire time.

06:19.061 --> 06:21.530
Your brother was. To distract us I imagine,

06:21.566 --> 06:23.683
but you... you were missing.

06:23.710 --> 06:25.446
For eleven minutes, Mr. Houdini,

06:25.464 --> 06:28.168
- you were out of sight.
- That was your idea all along.

06:28.288 --> 06:31.894
To personally invite us to your little show
while you slip next door and rob the bank vault.

06:31.903 --> 06:34.001
I won't stand for such allegations.

06:34.046 --> 06:36.171
Mr. Houdini, you still
have to account for the fact

06:36.198 --> 06:38.169
that you were identified leaving the bank.

06:38.289 --> 06:41.478
- It wasn't me.
- Where were you for those eleven minutes?

06:41.515 --> 06:44.173
- I will not divulge my secrets.
- Oh yes you will!

06:45.466 --> 06:46.551
You haven't a lick of proof

06:46.587 --> 06:48.830
or you'd have already
arrested me. Am I right?

06:51.588 --> 06:53.134
I'll say good evening, gentlemen.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.015
I'm watching you, Harold.

06:55.386 --> 06:56.724
Harry.

06:57.719 --> 06:59.429
It's Harry Houdini.

06:59.655 --> 07:01.635
Soon everyone will know my name.

07:01.997 --> 07:04.158
Not for the reasons you'd like.

07:04.384 --> 07:05.985
He did it all right.

07:06.030 --> 07:08.544
With that brother of his.
Right under our very noses.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.036
But you know what galls me the most?

07:10.045 --> 07:12.712
They invited us to the show so we
could provide them with an alibi.

07:12.758 --> 07:14.883
Sirs, the bank manager.

07:15.003 --> 07:17.224
- Edgar Simms.
- Detective William Murdoch.

07:17.261 --> 07:18.952
Inspector Thomas Brackenreid.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.824
This is just impossible.

07:20.979 --> 07:23.395
We installed a new vault 18 months ago.

07:23.418 --> 07:24.847
It has a state-of-the-art mechanism.

07:24.883 --> 07:27.370
- Mechanism?
- A time lock that secures

07:27.379 --> 07:30.273
the vault between the
hours of 8 p.m. and 8 a.m.

07:30.393 --> 07:33.148
The regular combination lock
is useless during that period.

07:33.268 --> 07:35.155
But someone did breach the vault.

07:35.164 --> 07:38.782
They would have had to dynamite their
way in, which is clearly not the case.

07:39.764 --> 07:41.938
And on the biggest deposit day of the year.

07:42.155 --> 07:43.746
How much was in there?

07:43.866 --> 07:46.721
152 000 dollars.

07:47.065 --> 07:50.013
- Money...
- It'll be my head for this, of course;

07:50.857 --> 07:53.461
that's nothing compared to
the price poor Jonah paid.

07:53.498 --> 07:55.831
- Jonah?
- Jonah Decker.

07:58.715 --> 08:00.343
Detective Murdoch?

08:00.463 --> 08:02.125
Excuse me.

08:08.889 --> 08:12.479
It would appear the victim was killed
by blunt force trauma to the head.

08:12.705 --> 08:15.382
I'm fairly certain that his
occipital bone is fractured.

08:15.792 --> 08:17.697
So Mr. Decker was making his rounds

08:17.817 --> 08:20.491
and the burglar sapped him
on the back of the head.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.464
I'd like to take the body to the
morgue now if that's all right.

08:23.466 --> 08:25.076
Of course. Thank you.

08:26.731 --> 08:27.979
Do you mind?

08:28.431 --> 08:30.873
I usually only partake on the weekends.

08:30.891 --> 08:33.667
But these are extenuating circumstances.

08:35.105 --> 08:39.662
I'd say he's got 152 000
extenuating circumstances.

08:45.088 --> 08:47.358
I'm sorry our evening was cut short.

08:47.478 --> 08:50.043
- As am I.
- Jules!

08:50.260 --> 08:51.960
Give your sister a lift?

08:52.549 --> 08:55.813
Detective William Murdoch meet
Miss Ruby Ogden. My sister.

08:56.428 --> 08:58.815
- Younger sister.
- It's a pleasure.

08:58.935 --> 09:01.962
I thought it fun to surprise Jules
with my little stage appearance.

09:01.980 --> 09:05.063
Ruby, can we please put
this Jules business to rest?

09:05.109 --> 09:08.364
I'm not a thumb boy. Anymore.

09:09.331 --> 09:11.238
You never told me you had a sister.

09:11.265 --> 09:12.992
- And in the theatre.
- Well...

09:13.038 --> 09:14.837
Actually, I'm a reporter.

09:14.873 --> 09:17.270
But I believe that in order to
get to the heart of any story,

09:17.288 --> 09:19.648
one must become part of the experience.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.474
I decided to write about Harry Houdini.

09:21.594 --> 09:23.437
So naturally you joined the show.

09:25.616 --> 09:28.799
We really must be going. I
have a post mortem to conduct.

09:29.215 --> 09:33.511
Well, I suspect we shall see
each other again, Miss Ogden.

09:33.791 --> 09:36.648
Ruby. I'll make certain of it.

09:38.918 --> 09:40.663
Good evening.

09:42.119 --> 09:44.344
You're not happy to see me.

09:44.497 --> 09:47.346
I thought you were still in
India writing about that Raja.

09:47.382 --> 09:49.698
That's old hat. I was drawn to London,

09:49.716 --> 09:53.360
met the most fascinating
novelist: Herbert George Wells.

09:53.480 --> 09:55.430
He became the subject
of a series of articles.

09:55.448 --> 09:57.076
And now the world is at his feet.

09:57.682 --> 10:00.669
And I imagine, as usual, you became
quite close with your subject?

10:00.754 --> 10:02.306
That would be kissing and telling.

10:02.324 --> 10:03.898
So now it's Houdini?

10:04.042 --> 10:06.340
I thought he would make
an interesting story,

10:06.358 --> 10:08.475
and after this evening even more so.

10:08.595 --> 10:10.210
Well, how lucky for him.

10:10.925 --> 10:12.860
It is, isn't it?

10:14.045 --> 10:16.170
It's so good to see you, Jules.

10:16.290 --> 10:18.476
We are going to have such fun.

10:28.858 --> 10:30.033
What's this?

10:30.323 --> 10:32.276
Playing with your toys, Murdoch?

10:32.276 --> 10:33.605
It's a model of the bank.

10:33.614 --> 10:36.345
Recreating the scene helps
me visualizing the crime.

10:36.562 --> 10:38.498
Well, you can forget that.

10:38.534 --> 10:41.247
Because I've figured it out.

10:41.464 --> 10:44.321
Bank... theater.

10:45.044 --> 10:48.227
Houdini escapes from the
vault in mere seconds.

10:48.255 --> 10:49.693
Exits through the side door,

10:49.720 --> 10:52.777
enters the bank, whacks Decker on the head,

10:53.337 --> 10:56.963
robs the vault, reenters the
theatre, stashes the money,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.595
then reappears as if by magic.

10:59.715 --> 11:02.820
But the theatre was thoroughly
searched; no money was found.

11:02.822 --> 11:04.822
Murdoch, the man's a magician.

11:04.942 --> 11:07.064
He could have stashed the
loot in some secret compartment

11:07.073 --> 11:08.818
in a magic trunk for all we know.

11:08.818 --> 11:10.094
And what about the time lock?

11:10.096 --> 11:11.929
He escaped from one vault, didn't he?

11:11.956 --> 11:15.438
Sir, that vault was part of a stage
show. Mere trickery and illusion.

11:15.868 --> 11:17.789
So he knew how to bugger the time lock.

11:18.070 --> 11:20.512
For your hypothesis to work,

11:20.512 --> 11:23.839
every minute detail of this plan
would have had to have gone perfectly.

11:23.857 --> 11:26.453
And it did! Look,

11:26.463 --> 11:29.121
I want one more crack
at that little smart ass.

11:35.732 --> 11:37.685
We'll have to keep an eye
on this Houdini character.

11:37.694 --> 11:40.036
He's got a sharp tongue on him.

11:40.461 --> 11:43.690
- I don't think his tongue will be a problem, Sir.
- Why is that?

11:45.291 --> 11:46.747
What the bloody hell is he doing?

11:46.783 --> 11:50.147
It's a lung capacity exercise.
He's practicing for his new escape.

11:50.267 --> 11:52.109
He's been in there for 2 minutes.

11:52.661 --> 11:53.936
Two minutes?

11:54.056 --> 11:55.952
Three minutes is his personal best.

11:56.848 --> 11:59.660
Houdini, get your soggy ass out of there.

11:59.678 --> 12:02.607
Please, Sir, he's trying to
concentrate. He's mastering his body.

12:02.644 --> 12:05.022
I'll master his body, all
right. Now get him out!

12:05.142 --> 12:07.264
Sir, you might want to see this.

12:08.594 --> 12:11.767
- Figured it out, have you me old mocker?
- I believe so.

12:11.887 --> 12:13.911
The walls of the vault are solid.

12:14.031 --> 12:16.089
The floor however...

12:19.246 --> 12:20.684
... is not.

12:24.599 --> 12:26.046
So last night,

12:26.055 --> 12:28.206
your brother escaped
from his chains quickly,

12:28.207 --> 12:31.281
slipped through that trap door and
vanished beneath the stage floor.

12:31.327 --> 12:34.501
2'58, 2'59, 3 minutes, Harry!

12:34.519 --> 12:36.979
He's out of the vault in mere
seconds and off to rob the bank.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.810
Don't be ridiculous. My brother
would never do such a thing.

12:40.036 --> 12:42.120
Get him out now.

12:42.441 --> 12:44.530
I think that's been long enough, Harry.

12:45.127 --> 12:47.840
Harry? Harry?!

12:48.265 --> 12:50.209
Oye, Houdini!

12:51.312 --> 12:53.998
- Something's wrong with the lad.
- Harry!

12:54.034 --> 12:55.969
Houdini!

13:01.033 --> 13:03.909
- Doctor...
- Oh! William! Good grief!

13:04.126 --> 13:06.368
You scared me to death.

13:07.363 --> 13:08.656
Oh...

13:08.918 --> 13:12.219
I apologize about my
appearance. I'm short of staff...

13:12.339 --> 13:14.661
- It's quite all right.
- I hope you're not here about Mr. Decker.

13:14.661 --> 13:17.238
I've haven't had a chance to
perform the post mortem yet

13:17.238 --> 13:19.553
for obvious reasons. But I will shortly.

13:20.005 --> 13:23.966
I appreciate that. However,
I'm here for a different reason.

13:23.975 --> 13:25.866
Yes.

13:25.911 --> 13:29.021
Inspectors have the opinion
that Mr. Houdini perpetrated

13:29.048 --> 13:30.604
the murder and the robbery.

13:31.246 --> 13:33.579
Oh? You sound skeptical.

13:33.624 --> 13:35.741
Yes, well, Mr. Houdini is

13:35.768 --> 13:36.980
very flamboyant

13:37.025 --> 13:39.503
as though he's performing
on a stage at all times.

13:39.623 --> 13:42.619
He's a born showman. That
shouldn't make him a suspect.

13:42.739 --> 13:43.861
No, it shouldn't.

13:43.870 --> 13:46.529
However, he refuses to divulge where he was

13:46.538 --> 13:48.997
while the robbery was
being committed. Allow me.

13:49.377 --> 13:52.632
Further, as you already know, a witness

13:52.741 --> 13:56.141
claims to have seen Mr.
Houdini fleeing the bank.

13:56.412 --> 13:58.085
And what do you think, William?

13:58.293 --> 13:59.767
The witness could be mistaken and

13:59.887 --> 14:03.149
Mr. Houdini could simply have been
passing the time somewhere off stage

14:03.194 --> 14:04.921
as the robbery was being committed.

14:05.041 --> 14:06.767
So it may just have been a coincidence.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.163
It may or may not have.

14:09.470 --> 14:13.377
Therefore I will need to interview
everyone associated with the show

14:13.497 --> 14:15.547
including Miss Ruby.

14:15.667 --> 14:18.486
I thought it only fair
to tell you beforehand.

14:19.083 --> 14:21.037
Yes. Well, thank you.

14:22.013 --> 14:23.668
It's very good.

14:23.704 --> 14:25.079
William?

14:25.199 --> 14:27.955
Ruby may have well be
brash and somewhat dramatic,

14:27.991 --> 14:30.035
but I assure you: she
is not capable of murder.

14:30.243 --> 14:32.476
I'm sure it will be a mere formality.

14:33.580 --> 14:35.612
- Good day, Doctor.
- Good day.

14:42.089 --> 14:45.317
How does this sound? "King of the Fishes."

14:45.561 --> 14:47.488
Or... or...

14:47.608 --> 14:49.532
"Master of Water".

14:50.653 --> 14:53.591
Yes. Yes, someone write that down.

14:53.618 --> 14:55.409
I'll be writing you down
for murder and robbery

14:55.427 --> 14:58.266
if you can't account for where you those
11 minutes you disappeared, sunshine.

14:58.386 --> 15:00.582
Forget the 11 minutes, Sir!

15:00.609 --> 15:03.981
I just went 3 minutes and
22 seconds without air.

15:04.135 --> 15:07.309
Can you imagine the possibilities
for underwater escapes?

15:07.429 --> 15:09.877
A man died in that bank,

15:09.997 --> 15:11.830
and you're planning your next trick?

15:11.950 --> 15:14.009
I am sorry that man died

15:14.018 --> 15:15.583
and that the bank was robbed,

15:15.601 --> 15:17.671
but I had nothing to do with either.

15:17.970 --> 15:21.556
I am an artiste, not
a confidence trickster.

15:21.558 --> 15:23.342
Get your feet off!

15:23.703 --> 15:26.859
I would never use my
skills to brake the law.

15:31.752 --> 15:34.456
I will, however, sometimes use those skills

15:34.474 --> 15:36.092
to illicit laughter.

15:41.590 --> 15:44.131
That man is an arrogant little git.

15:44.176 --> 15:45.524
You can't arrest him for that.

15:45.542 --> 15:47.775
I know the flaws in our justice system.

15:48.037 --> 15:49.412
What are you doing?

15:50.262 --> 15:52.867
I'm curious as to how the
bank robber entered the bank

15:52.903 --> 15:56.384
- without triggering the alarm.
- No, not "robber". Houdini.

15:56.872 --> 15:59.856
- I have an idea.
- This should be good.

15:59.902 --> 16:01.212
Butter.

16:02.099 --> 16:03.726
Butter, George?

16:04.169 --> 16:06.294
I believe he slathered himself in butter

16:06.312 --> 16:09.079
and slithered into the
bank via the air vents.

16:09.278 --> 16:13.646
Bloody hell, Crabtree, he wasn't covered in
butter when he returned to the theatre, was he?

16:14.307 --> 16:15.916
Good point, Inspector.

16:16.124 --> 16:19.923
Actually, Sir, there might be something
to what constable Crabtree is saying.

16:19.932 --> 16:21.722
- There might?
- There is?

16:22.391 --> 16:25.149
Not about the butter,
George, the vents. Go on.

16:25.269 --> 16:27.808
Yes, well I think he may
have scaled the exterior wall,

16:27.844 --> 16:31.742
and then slipped through a small
window into this 16-inch vent.

16:31.968 --> 16:36.607
He then came along through this vent
and emerged right next to the vault.

16:36.833 --> 16:38.407
It's possible.

16:38.651 --> 16:41.454
Well done. You could be onto something.

16:41.472 --> 16:43.751
- No he isn't.
- Sweet...

16:45.054 --> 16:47.549
- Hello, Detective.
- Miss Ruby?

16:47.794 --> 16:49.556
A bit of help?

17:00.408 --> 17:02.108
My coat?

17:02.823 --> 17:05.174
Very kind. Thank you.

17:05.294 --> 17:07.751
The dress was so bulky, I had to remove it.

17:07.871 --> 17:09.170
For the experiment.

17:09.188 --> 17:11.395
And what experiment
would that be, Miss... ?

17:11.413 --> 17:13.393
Ogden. Ruby Ogden.

17:13.719 --> 17:15.291
Doctor Ogden's sister.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.657
The naughty one, I presume.

17:16.675 --> 17:20.574
I'll have you know that of the two Ogden sisters,
I am the only one who has not been arrested.

17:20.809 --> 17:22.491
Are you here to arrest me?

17:22.611 --> 17:25.621
- Doctor Ogden has a criminal record?
- George. Please.

17:25.638 --> 17:27.546
Miss Ogden, the vent?

17:27.682 --> 17:30.268
Oh yes. You see, I believe
Mr. Houdini to be innocent.

17:30.277 --> 17:32.909
- I took it upon myself to prove so.
- Did you now?

17:33.469 --> 17:35.269
I came across the same theory

17:35.289 --> 17:36.661
that your clever Detective Crabtree did.

17:36.688 --> 17:39.329
Ma'am, I'm not a
Detective, just a constable.

17:39.564 --> 17:41.183
Not for long, I suspect.

17:41.409 --> 17:42.639
Thank you, Ma'am.

17:42.648 --> 17:44.980
Of course I had to test
this theory for myself.

17:45.100 --> 17:47.078
- But you got stuck.
- Exactly.

17:47.115 --> 17:49.303
Proving that Mr. Houdini
could not have done it.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.070
On the contrary, I believe
you've proven the opposite.

17:52.269 --> 17:54.078
But my shoulders were wedged.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.367
Mr. Houdini's shoulders would
have become wedged as well.

17:56.385 --> 17:59.197
I suspect Mr. Houdini is able
to dislocate his shoulders.

17:59.224 --> 18:01.665
It's a technique many
contortionists and escape artists

18:01.702 --> 18:02.805
have employed for years.

18:02.823 --> 18:04.785
So do you suppose that's how he
made his way through the vent?

18:04.821 --> 18:06.847
- Of course it is.
- Come on, Crabtree,

18:06.865 --> 18:09.849
let's go and pick Mr.
Houdini up. Miss Ogden.

18:11.024 --> 18:13.556
Detective, your Inspector
is quite mistaken.

18:13.559 --> 18:15.460
Oh? Why is that?

18:15.580 --> 18:18.329
Because I know in my heart
that Harry is innocent

18:18.331 --> 18:19.878
and I think you know it too.

18:19.896 --> 18:21.859
I'm afraid it's you that's mistaken.

18:22.112 --> 18:24.517
You see, I rely on logic,

18:24.637 --> 18:27.699
not feelings, to determine
or not if a person is guilty.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.024
Then perhaps you're merely capitulating

18:30.060 --> 18:32.303
to your Inspector's
deSire for a quick arrest.

18:32.321 --> 18:36.164
Miss Ogden, I could have you arrested
for tampering with a crime scene.

18:36.399 --> 18:38.913
Well then, you'd better
handcuff me, Detective.

18:41.933 --> 18:43.064
I won't...

18:43.588 --> 18:45.352
for your sister's sake.

18:46.437 --> 18:49.918
But if I find that you are withholding
information about this case,

18:49.945 --> 18:53.436
I will have no compunction
about changing my mind.

18:55.714 --> 18:57.568
Shall we?

19:00.498 --> 19:02.578
We know how you pulled the bank job.

19:02.698 --> 19:04.675
That's more than I know, Sir.

19:04.965 --> 19:07.388
Please, tell me your theory.

19:07.860 --> 19:10.394
On the night of your "great vault escape",

19:10.396 --> 19:12.758
you were planning an even
greater one next door.

19:13.030 --> 19:14.739
After escaping the vault on stage,

19:14.757 --> 19:17.488
you went to the bank then
entered through the vents.

19:19.369 --> 19:22.128
Where you proceeded then
to kill the night watchman.

19:25.030 --> 19:27.065
And clear out the vault.

19:27.608 --> 19:29.589
The only flaw in your plan:

19:29.709 --> 19:32.157
- you were spotted by someone.
- Well done.

19:32.356 --> 19:34.002
I certainly could have done that.

19:34.020 --> 19:37.330
- Is that a confession?
- You've got the wrong man.

19:37.773 --> 19:40.106
Tell me where you were
during the vault escape.

19:40.133 --> 19:41.860
That's your only alibi.

19:42.611 --> 19:45.070
I don't reveal my secrets to anyone.

19:45.190 --> 19:46.933
And I don't have to tell them to you

19:46.969 --> 19:49.501
because you have no concrete
proof of your allegations.

19:49.908 --> 19:52.912
If you want concrete I'll
give you bloody concrete.

19:55.701 --> 19:57.649
Maybe this will loosen you up.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.826
- Letting him sweat it a bit?
- That's right.

20:08.835 --> 20:12.090
- Houdini does have a point.
- Murdoch, I'm not in the mood.

20:12.117 --> 20:14.179
There's nothing tying him
to the robbery or the murder.

20:14.188 --> 20:15.734
Then there's the issue of the time lock.

20:15.761 --> 20:19.812
He'll talk once he tires of being
secured by real police-issue locks.

20:21.729 --> 20:23.230
You were standing in the bank

20:23.248 --> 20:26.169
wearing nothing but a
petticoat and a bodice?

20:27.716 --> 20:30.375
Detective Murdoch's face
went such a shade of red.

20:30.854 --> 20:32.464
It was sort of sweet.

20:33.097 --> 20:34.417
Really?

20:34.725 --> 20:37.456
- Is that tobacco I smell?
- Hm...

20:38.143 --> 20:41.589
- Jules! That's disgusting.
- Don't be such a mouse.

20:41.625 --> 20:43.632
The smell of a body can tell
you a lot about a person.

20:43.931 --> 20:46.978
What they ate. What they
drank. How much they smoked.

20:47.098 --> 20:49.357
This man was obviously a heavy smoker.

20:49.477 --> 20:52.070
- I see it all the times.
- It's really quite repulsive.

20:52.088 --> 20:53.263
Yes, it is.

20:53.383 --> 20:55.018
And if you continue to
smoke the way you do,

20:55.036 --> 20:56.700
you too will smell like this one day.

20:57.089 --> 21:00.453
- I'll have you know I quit.
- Of course you did...

21:03.725 --> 21:05.570
Now look what you've done.

21:05.690 --> 21:07.143
Here, let me.

21:11.501 --> 21:13.075
Have you paid mother a visit?

21:13.907 --> 21:17.108
Jules, you know how I
feel about cemeteries.

21:17.407 --> 21:19.025
I did visit daddy though.

21:19.052 --> 21:21.512
- He says he hasn't seen you in months.
- I've been busy.

21:21.530 --> 21:22.949
He'd like us to join him this weekend

21:22.958 --> 21:24.803
at the Rowing Club for lunch.

21:24.821 --> 21:27.688
I guess he will not take
"no thank you" for an answer.

21:28.113 --> 21:30.473
It might be good for you to
get out of this morgue for once.

21:30.593 --> 21:32.052
Don't you ever leave it?

21:32.054 --> 21:34.614
Of course I do. I do have
other interests, you know.

21:34.632 --> 21:35.798
Such as?

21:36.431 --> 21:38.846
I read, cycle,

21:38.966 --> 21:41.568
play tennis and attend
the theatre regularly.

21:41.921 --> 21:44.236
I was speaking more of male interests.

21:44.778 --> 21:48.115
Oh... yes. I have those too.

21:49.037 --> 21:50.946
Your Detective Murdoch?

21:51.434 --> 21:53.749
He's not my Detective.

21:53.869 --> 21:55.992
Our relationship is purely professional.

21:56.769 --> 21:58.493
Surely you've entertained the idea

21:58.512 --> 22:00.079
of probing his intriguing mind?

22:00.594 --> 22:02.186
Really, Ruby.

22:03.099 --> 22:06.382
Such a shame. He's a fine specimen.

22:11.754 --> 22:13.658
Jules? What is it?

22:14.104 --> 22:16.148
His blood...

22:16.383 --> 22:17.713
It's black.

22:20.416 --> 22:22.749
Smith! At least try to look busy!

22:25.941 --> 22:27.560
You really must do something

22:27.587 --> 22:29.785
about the locks on that
holding cell, Inspector.

22:30.120 --> 22:31.639
Crabtree!

22:32.724 --> 22:35.488
- Now double check the leg irons.
- Yes Sir!

22:38.210 --> 22:40.552
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.

22:40.751 --> 22:43.174
- Crabtree!
- Houdini!

22:43.735 --> 22:47.569
The vessels of his brains, lungs and
liver are all filled with black blood.

22:47.822 --> 22:50.146
- Poisoned?
- Precisely.

22:50.408 --> 22:53.410
What kind of poison turns
blood black? Something organic?

22:53.446 --> 22:54.857
An alkaloid perhaps.

22:55.074 --> 22:56.946
- Was it ingested?
- Most unlikely.

22:56.973 --> 22:59.216
The dosage required to kill
someone needs to be massive.

22:59.336 --> 23:00.319
Injected then?

23:00.342 --> 23:02.905
It's much more likely. Far more efficient.

23:03.122 --> 23:05.067
Then there would have
to be an injection site.

23:05.112 --> 23:07.925
- I was hoping to have found it before you arrived.
- Oh...

23:08.277 --> 23:10.140
I can wait.

23:11.171 --> 23:13.549
Have you had a chance to
visit with your sister?

23:13.594 --> 23:14.743
Yes.

23:15.890 --> 23:18.624
I received some arresting news from her.

23:18.626 --> 23:20.426
Regarding?

23:20.648 --> 23:23.244
Your conviction of character.

23:25.730 --> 23:29.266
Ah, puns... the feeblest form of humour.

23:29.386 --> 23:30.713
Is it true then?

23:31.120 --> 23:32.440
Your arrest?

23:33.341 --> 23:36.429
One hot summer evening, when
I was home from university,

23:36.456 --> 23:39.471
my colleagues and I enjoyed
swimming off Hanlan's Point.

23:39.715 --> 23:41.261
Sans clothing.

23:42.075 --> 23:43.884
Most risqué.

23:44.004 --> 23:45.286
I don't know which was worse,

23:45.304 --> 23:47.673
being arrested or having
your parents find out.

23:47.972 --> 23:49.726
I found it.

23:50.233 --> 23:51.363
I'm sorry?

23:51.707 --> 23:53.922
I found it. The puncture mark. Come see.

23:55.062 --> 23:57.721
It goes straight through the
sclera and into the anterior orbit.

24:02.134 --> 24:04.512
Let me get this straight...

24:07.713 --> 24:10.381
Mr. Decker was smashed on the
head as part of the robbery.

24:10.408 --> 24:13.808
Yet the burglar injected
him with poison as well.

24:20.997 --> 24:24.424
So that means the robber came
prepared to kill Mr. Decker.

24:24.544 --> 24:26.568
If he was poisoned, why...

24:26.577 --> 24:28.385
... Make it look as though he
died from a blow to the head?

24:28.403 --> 24:31.324
I think it was to create the
illusion of a robbery gone wrong.

24:31.333 --> 24:32.762
Why such an elaborate plan?

24:32.798 --> 24:35.366
Perhaps Mr. Decker was also
involved in the robbery.

24:35.375 --> 24:36.813
An inside job.

24:37.048 --> 24:38.703
So he willingly let himself get bashed

24:38.721 --> 24:40.484
over the back of the head,
making it appear as though

24:40.520 --> 24:42.763
he caught the robbery in
the act. So why is he dead?

24:42.883 --> 24:44.472
Maybe his partner got greedy.

24:44.481 --> 24:46.371
Decided to take the
whole kitty for himself.

24:46.416 --> 24:48.866
That would explain why the
alarms weren't activated.

24:49.210 --> 24:52.023
Houdini didn't scale any walls
or shimmy through any vents.

24:52.143 --> 24:53.497
Decker opened the door
and let him walk right in.

24:53.524 --> 24:55.658
But Sir, this could be the missing piece...

24:55.778 --> 24:57.639
Thank you, Murdoch. I was
hoping for your approval.

24:57.657 --> 25:00.894
But you might also entertain
the possibility that someone

25:00.940 --> 25:03.119
was capitalizing on
Houdini's known abilities

25:03.155 --> 25:04.783
- as an escape artist.
- How so?

25:04.819 --> 25:06.320
Maybe he was set up?

25:06.347 --> 25:09.241
Merely a pawn in someone else's plans.

25:10.606 --> 25:14.143
Not likely, Murdoch. Pawn's don't escape.

25:24.496 --> 25:26.350
Hotels, flophouses,

25:26.395 --> 25:29.063
the train station: search
everywhere. And I mean everywhere.

25:29.081 --> 25:31.884
This is a man who can fold
himself into a bloody teapot.

25:31.929 --> 25:34.651
Well don't just stand
like dummies! Move it!

25:34.771 --> 25:38.494
Sir, I think we must also
fully explore the possibility

25:38.521 --> 25:41.107
that Houdini was not
involve in this inside job.

25:41.135 --> 25:44.326
Fine, fine. Let's say he
wasn't. Then who was in on it?

25:44.353 --> 25:46.090
Someone who knew the inner
workings of the vault.

25:46.126 --> 25:48.260
Someone who knew that
the vault would be full.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.384
- Simms, the bank manager.
- That's where I would start.

25:50.430 --> 25:52.654
Very well, Murdoch, you take one scenario

25:52.681 --> 25:55.286
and I'll take the other.
We'll see how it turns out.

26:03.814 --> 26:05.957
Ah! Mr. Simms. May I have a word?

26:05.975 --> 26:07.132
Of course, Detective.

26:07.150 --> 26:08.859
The bank owners are breathing down my neck,

26:08.886 --> 26:10.749
so I do hope you have
some good news for me.

26:10.767 --> 26:13.544
We have determined how the
burglar entered the building.

26:13.589 --> 26:14.954
- You have?
- Yes.

26:14.972 --> 26:17.421
He was allowed entry
by your night watchman.

26:17.766 --> 26:20.154
Why would Decker do that? Unless...

26:20.172 --> 26:22.216
... He was involved in the burglary.

26:22.261 --> 26:24.521
But he was murdered, wasn't
he? How do you explain that?

26:24.549 --> 26:26.719
- Killed by his partner.
- Partner?

26:26.839 --> 26:29.332
Yes. Someone with intimate
knowledge of the bank.

26:29.378 --> 26:32.633
Someone who knew that the
vault would be full of cash.

26:32.977 --> 26:35.355
Are you insinuating that
I may have been involved?

26:35.475 --> 26:37.915
You also had knowledge of
the mechanics of the locks.

26:37.942 --> 26:39.081
Not the time lock.

26:39.126 --> 26:41.224
I couldn't have breached
it. It is impervious.

26:41.730 --> 26:43.358
We shall see, Mr. Simms.

26:43.394 --> 26:46.179
Yes, I suppose we shall.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.806
Back to the station.

27:05.567 --> 27:08.099
- What are you up to?
- Oh! Hello, Inspector.

27:08.126 --> 27:10.027
I'm just testing a batch
of poppers I just made.

27:10.029 --> 27:11.824
It's common in every magician's arsenal.

27:11.861 --> 27:12.892
You make them yourself?

27:12.919 --> 27:15.414
It's rudimentary science.
You take a little bit of this

27:15.534 --> 27:18.127
with a little of that and...

27:18.435 --> 27:19.936
Planning on going somewhere?

27:19.972 --> 27:21.962
Oh! With the show losing money like it had,

27:21.998 --> 27:24.557
with Harry in jail, well,
the end is near, isn't it?

27:24.576 --> 27:27.116
- Houdini's not in jail.
- What?

27:27.152 --> 27:28.172
He's escaped.

27:28.292 --> 27:30.073
I thought you might know where he is.

27:30.193 --> 27:31.936
Well, I have no clue where he is. But

27:31.963 --> 27:34.196
don't take it personally, you're
not the first to loose him.

27:34.233 --> 27:35.797
I plan to be the last.

27:36.058 --> 27:38.310
By the way, I am not Harry's brother.

27:38.337 --> 27:40.869
I am just the fifth in a
long line of Houdini brothers.

27:40.905 --> 27:41.945
Fifth?

27:42.144 --> 27:44.694
Yes. He thinks it looks
better on the posters.

27:44.712 --> 27:45.906
Who are you then?

27:46.240 --> 27:48.393
Leopold Romanov, illusionist.

27:48.438 --> 27:50.246
Why do you work for such a young lad?

27:50.366 --> 27:53.076
Harry Houdini is the greatest
talent I've ever seen. But

27:53.122 --> 27:56.088
- he's not much of a businessman.
- So you run the show?

27:56.088 --> 27:58.710
Yes, I schedule performances
and make travel arrangements.

27:58.738 --> 28:02.219
I focus on the details while
he dreams up his next escapes.

28:02.339 --> 28:05.746
So with the show losing money, a full
bank vault could look quite tempting.

28:05.954 --> 28:07.917
I don't think Harry would do this.

28:07.953 --> 28:09.346
I see.

28:09.707 --> 28:11.941
Don't leave town any
time soon, Mr. Romanov.

28:11.986 --> 28:13.975
And if you see Mr. Houdini,

28:14.095 --> 28:16.634
tell him to do the smart thing
and turn himself in. Got it?

28:20.061 --> 28:24.075
George, I need you to find out
anything you can about Mr. Decker.

28:24.103 --> 28:25.830
Where he was before his job at the bank,

28:25.857 --> 28:27.711
if he was ever in any
trouble from an old record,

28:27.729 --> 28:29.347
- that sort of things.
- Right away.

28:29.366 --> 28:32.169
- And the same for Edgar Simms.
- Sir.

28:38.482 --> 28:40.591
What in the world is that, Detective?

28:42.045 --> 28:44.162
It's a Sergeant and Greenleaf time lock,

28:44.189 --> 28:46.893
identical to the one
at the Bank of Toronto.

28:47.164 --> 28:50.434
Twenty years ago, it saw
the downfall of Jesse James.

28:50.436 --> 28:54.004
Now it's proving to be mine as well.

28:56.543 --> 28:58.523
Perhaps you need a break.

28:58.984 --> 29:00.964
I'm quite preoccupied at the moment.

29:01.513 --> 29:03.976
You're still angry with me.

29:04.349 --> 29:05.396
No.

29:05.516 --> 29:08.964
No, I always welcome a healthy
critique of my policing technique.

29:09.855 --> 29:11.948
I've come to make it up to you.

29:12.658 --> 29:14.344
That's not necessary.

29:14.580 --> 29:16.506
I think it is.

29:50.661 --> 29:53.500
I've never been treated
to dinner by a lady before.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.291
So that would make me your first.

29:56.077 --> 29:57.370
How charming.

29:57.922 --> 29:59.495
Ah, well...

29:59.712 --> 30:01.846
You were speaking before about the

30:01.966 --> 30:04.369
novel that Herbert Wells
wrote, "The Time Machine".

30:04.396 --> 30:06.654
He's a notorious amorist, you know.

30:06.883 --> 30:07.670
Oh.

30:07.790 --> 30:10.211
Fortunately, I'm a notorious woman.

30:12.870 --> 30:16.116
Yes, well, it sounds fascinating
and I'd very much like to read it.

30:16.152 --> 30:18.928
- Do you have a copy?
- I didn't read it myself.

30:19.281 --> 30:20.836
Bertie read it to me in his garden

30:20.863 --> 30:23.106
over a bottle of Vipava Pikolit.

30:23.724 --> 30:26.136
I assume the two of you were very close.

30:26.256 --> 30:29.326
It's natural to become involved
with those whom you work closest.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.336
Don't you think?

30:31.589 --> 30:33.180
I suppose.

30:34.175 --> 30:36.011
Are you involved?

30:37.864 --> 30:39.140
No.

30:40.252 --> 30:42.757
But there is someone I find intriguing.

30:43.417 --> 30:45.786
Perhaps you ought to
tell her of your feelings.

30:45.906 --> 30:49.286
I can't think of why any woman
would not reciprocate them.

30:51.727 --> 30:53.934
Don't tell Jules, all right?

30:54.169 --> 30:55.896
I told her I cut down.

31:00.888 --> 31:02.100
Good evening, Constable.

31:02.118 --> 31:04.478
Good evening, Dr. Ogden.
Working late this evening?

31:04.505 --> 31:06.911
As usually, I'm afraid. Detective
Murdoch as well, I presume.

31:06.947 --> 31:08.864
- Actually, he's gone out.
- Oh?

31:08.900 --> 31:10.238
I was hoping he could
help me with something.

31:10.274 --> 31:11.857
You don't know where he is, do you?

31:11.977 --> 31:14.624
Hum... He's gone out.

31:14.744 --> 31:16.505
Yes, we've established that.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.512
Hum...

31:18.720 --> 31:21.252
Constable, is there something
you're not telling me?

31:44.582 --> 31:48.046
It's such a joy to meet
another curious soul.

31:50.859 --> 31:53.698
- Good evening.
- Jules!

31:53.970 --> 31:57.858
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry. I'm obviously interrupting.

31:58.753 --> 32:01.683
Nonsense. Nonsense. Please, join us.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.856
Are you staying long?

32:06.976 --> 32:09.216
That depends on Detective Murdoch,

32:09.262 --> 32:11.034
and whether he can help me with a mystery

32:11.043 --> 32:12.788
I'm attempting to unravel.

32:12.908 --> 32:15.691
Oh? What sort of mystery?

32:15.693 --> 32:17.325
Poisons.

32:18.649 --> 32:21.896
Then perhaps it was Deadly
Nightshade that killed Mr. Decker?

32:22.166 --> 32:24.635
Belladonna? I considered
it. And it would have

32:24.662 --> 32:26.769
accounted for the stomach inflammation, but

32:26.787 --> 32:29.328
but there were no signs
that the tissue was stained.

32:29.880 --> 32:31.399
The Thorn Apple?

32:31.788 --> 32:35.097
The brain was filled with black blood.
There was no signs of congestion.

32:35.387 --> 32:36.761
Hum...

32:37.648 --> 32:41.518
Who would have access to such
deadly and exotic poisons?

32:41.717 --> 32:44.611
I would think someone with
a background in chemistry.

32:44.731 --> 32:46.509
Well then, Harry couldn't have done it.

32:46.629 --> 32:48.905
He has no experience with chemistry.

32:49.312 --> 32:52.432
- I'll have to determine that.
- And really,

32:52.552 --> 32:55.091
just how well do you know him, Ruby?

32:55.326 --> 32:57.876
Well enough to know he
couldn't have done it.

32:59.152 --> 33:01.024
Mr. Houdini did have motive.

33:01.144 --> 33:03.005
Not to mention opportunity.

33:03.125 --> 33:05.554
You are forgetting how
important a man's character is.

33:05.563 --> 33:07.951
Harry would never rob a
bank, let alone kill a man.

33:07.987 --> 33:11.414
In our line of work, Ruby, you learn
that character can be deceptive.

33:12.056 --> 33:15.031
Your line of work is hardly
the same as Detective Murdoch's.

33:15.483 --> 33:17.274
I would argue that journalism

33:17.310 --> 33:19.101
and detecting share a
much greater affinity.

33:19.128 --> 33:20.756
Really, Ruby.

33:20.783 --> 33:22.953
Detective Murdoch and I solve mysteries.

33:22.998 --> 33:25.467
You spend your time riding elephants with

33:25.512 --> 33:28.351
sultans and lolling about with artists.

33:28.623 --> 33:29.889
This is your problem.

33:29.968 --> 33:33.072
You can't help but neatly
categorize everyone and everything.

33:33.081 --> 33:35.104
Your vision is so narrow.

33:35.106 --> 33:37.305
William and I share a
broader sense of the world.

33:37.350 --> 33:39.033
Did you just call him William?

33:39.358 --> 33:40.950
Hum... pardon me.

33:41.203 --> 33:44.368
- I don't mean to interrupt...
- Oh! Please do, George.

33:44.413 --> 33:46.086
I have some news, Sir.

33:46.113 --> 33:49.468
Well, then I'll have to excuse myself.

33:49.513 --> 33:51.558
Of course.

33:53.584 --> 33:55.293
I'll make this as discreet as possible.

33:55.320 --> 33:57.436
I suspect that the 2 of
you are intimately involved

33:57.463 --> 34:00.330
so if you happen to see Mr. Houdini,

34:00.348 --> 34:03.902
would you please let him know that
I'd like very much to speak with him?

34:06.615 --> 34:08.929
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

34:10.521 --> 34:11.795
What was that about?

34:11.804 --> 34:13.713
None of your business.

34:14.455 --> 34:16.914
The two Miss Ogdens seemed quite a handful.

34:16.940 --> 34:19.409
Your timing could not have
been better. Thank you.

34:19.530 --> 34:21.083
What do you have for me, George?

34:21.092 --> 34:23.632
I found something interesting
about Mr. Decker's past.

34:23.678 --> 34:24.382
Oh?

34:24.400 --> 34:27.033
His former employer was
the United States Army.

34:27.152 --> 34:28.931
Engineering core to be exact.

34:29.052 --> 34:31.953
He has the skills to be an
engineer yet ends up in Canada

34:31.998 --> 34:33.598
working as a night watchman?

34:33.626 --> 34:37.170
And he's hired at the bank at the
same time the vault is being installed.

34:37.795 --> 34:40.308
He was hired by Mr. Simms.

34:40.326 --> 34:41.989
Interesting coincidence, I thought.

34:42.362 --> 34:44.739
Perhaps we should have
another word with Mr. Simms.

34:44.859 --> 34:47.831
Mr. Simms is working late and
doesn't like to be disturbed.

34:47.859 --> 34:50.951
He will be in an even worse
mood once I am finished with him.

34:53.275 --> 34:55.030
That's odd.

34:55.150 --> 34:57.806
Oh!

35:01.342 --> 35:02.717
Dead.

35:03.675 --> 35:07.212
Sir, how can this be an inside
job if both inside men are dead?

35:07.332 --> 35:09.264
Because there's something
else at work here, George,

35:09.291 --> 35:12.800
that we hadn't thought of: a third man.

35:21.535 --> 35:23.272
So now this robbery is
a three-man operation.

35:23.290 --> 35:24.728
So it would seem.

35:24.848 --> 35:27.703
And you're suggesting that
Simms hired Decker 18 months ago

35:27.739 --> 35:30.660
- to sabotage the vault while it was being installed.
- Exactly.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.984
- But the vault works.
- Does it?

35:33.104 --> 35:35.887
I think we haven't figured out how
the locks have been tampered with.

35:36.141 --> 35:39.725
All right. So Decker continues
working as a night watchman

35:39.727 --> 35:42.688
and the two of them by their
time waiting for a big payday.

35:42.706 --> 35:44.211
The plan was for Simms

35:44.216 --> 35:47.462
to break in dressed as Houdini,
bash Decker over the head

35:47.502 --> 35:50.317
- and make off with the money.
- Blame would fall on Houdini.

35:50.437 --> 35:52.274
But Simms double-crossed his partner.

35:52.292 --> 35:55.276
And in turn, someone
else double-crossed Simms.

35:55.396 --> 35:56.632
The question is,

35:56.752 --> 35:59.626
who's this third character? And
what role did it play in all of this?

35:59.746 --> 36:02.827
I'm hoping the exotic poison holds the key.

36:03.333 --> 36:06.182
I've already tested over
twenty different poisons.

36:06.302 --> 36:08.008
And none of them turned the blood black?

36:08.035 --> 36:10.675
No. But I'm not about to give up yet.

36:10.795 --> 36:13.397
- Would you care to assist?
- Certainly.

36:17.381 --> 36:20.808
I want to apologize about last night.

36:20.928 --> 36:22.653
At dinner.

36:23.395 --> 36:25.239
That's no for hemlock.

36:25.359 --> 36:27.120
An apology isn't necessary.

36:27.240 --> 36:28.530
No for phenol.

36:28.650 --> 36:31.777
Ruby and I often find ourselves
on opposite ends of a good debate.

36:31.795 --> 36:33.124
Or a bad one.

36:33.244 --> 36:34.589
No for Strychnine.

36:34.806 --> 36:36.425
And who usually wins?

36:36.545 --> 36:39.590
You've met Ruby. I think
you know the answer.

36:39.710 --> 36:41.852
But I may have won one battle:

36:41.972 --> 36:44.039
I think I might have
convinced her to stop smoking.

36:45.649 --> 36:46.643
Oh?

36:46.680 --> 36:48.407
With the help of Mr. Decker.

36:48.425 --> 36:51.599
- What do you mean?
- She was here when I opened him up.

36:51.626 --> 36:53.534
That smell would convince anyone to quit.

36:53.571 --> 36:56.329
- His body smelled of tobacco?
- Yes.

36:56.449 --> 36:58.879
Actually, both he and Mr. Simms reeked.

37:01.032 --> 37:01.954
Wait.

37:02.074 --> 37:03.464
Do you mind?

37:04.151 --> 37:06.321
Normally, I only partake on the weekends.

37:06.441 --> 37:09.034
Simms told me that he
smoked only on occasion,

37:09.079 --> 37:12.126
yet his body also smelled
heavily of tobacco.

37:13.075 --> 37:14.966
Nicotine.

37:30.220 --> 37:32.101
That would account for the black blood.

37:32.482 --> 37:35.267
- We now have our poison.
- A most obscure choice.

37:35.294 --> 37:36.768
Indeed.

37:47.159 --> 37:48.723
Don't turn on the light.

37:49.402 --> 37:51.563
I'd rather not have a
run-in with that ill-spirited

37:51.604 --> 37:52.937
Inspector of yours.

37:52.964 --> 37:54.619
He doesn't seem to like me.

37:56.410 --> 37:59.276
- I can't imagine why.
- It is a puzzle.

37:59.520 --> 38:02.179
I take it you contacted Miss Ruby.

38:02.181 --> 38:04.855
She's hard to... avoid.

38:05.081 --> 38:07.035
How may I help you?

38:08.310 --> 38:10.842
Mr. Houdini, I need your opinion.

38:10.962 --> 38:11.882
Opinion?

38:12.002 --> 38:15.327
Yes. You exceed in
illusion and showmanship.

38:15.447 --> 38:16.928
Thank you.

38:17.195 --> 38:18.384
And I've come to the conclusion

38:18.420 --> 38:21.060
that what I am dealing with
here is an act of trickery.

38:21.087 --> 38:24.044
Because logical explanations
seem to elude me.

38:24.388 --> 38:25.699
I see.

38:25.819 --> 38:29.090
And if I do help you figure it
out, will that not implicate me

38:29.108 --> 38:31.685
and encourage you to arrest me again?

38:32.155 --> 38:33.919
Only if you're guilty.

38:36.049 --> 38:38.512
Then we have a deal.

38:39.190 --> 38:42.003
Clearly the robbery was
an illusion of some sort.

38:42.030 --> 38:43.151
Agreed.

38:43.271 --> 38:45.474
But I've examined the locks on the vault,

38:45.594 --> 38:46.796
and they weren't tampered with.

38:46.823 --> 38:49.011
Then, Detective, something else is amiss.

38:49.131 --> 38:51.408
What? If the vault is secure.

38:51.418 --> 38:54.067
No false walls, no tunnels.

38:54.881 --> 38:57.458
Illusions are steeped in deception.

38:57.578 --> 39:00.849
Something that makes the audience
believe one thing to be true

39:00.969 --> 39:03.544
- while it clearly isn't.
- Such as?

39:03.879 --> 39:06.610
Say I make an entire train disappear.

39:07.381 --> 39:10.128
Well, obviously I didn't really, did I?

39:10.248 --> 39:13.103
Either it remains there
and you cannot see it...

39:13.672 --> 39:16.376
Or it was never there in the first place.

39:26.224 --> 39:27.761
It's not the vault.

39:28.087 --> 39:29.606
It's the bank.

39:30.972 --> 39:33.278
Did you have to drag us all
the way down here, Murdoch?

39:33.504 --> 39:36.380
Sir, if you will, I have a demonstration.

39:36.500 --> 39:37.962
Well, get on with it then.

39:37.980 --> 39:41.046
I'll barely have time for a quick
scotch before the Missus expects me home.

39:41.166 --> 39:44.618
- Still on the short leash, Sir?
- Shut it, Crabtree.

39:44.835 --> 39:48.327
Sir, I believe that this robbery
was the product of an illusion.

39:48.447 --> 39:51.039
Many patrons of this bank would disagree.

39:51.820 --> 39:56.004
Let me show you. Now.
It's nearly eight o'clock.

39:56.040 --> 39:59.540
The vault's time lock mechanism
should be sliding into place...

40:00.517 --> 40:02.316
now.

40:02.787 --> 40:04.152
George.

40:04.272 --> 40:05.997
Please see that the vault is secured.

40:09.478 --> 40:13.059
- Hum! Hum! It's solid, Sir.
- Yes, it is.

40:14.008 --> 40:16.540
But the wall...

40:21.297 --> 40:23.938
The wall is not.

40:24.191 --> 40:25.973
Bloody hell...

40:26.093 --> 40:29.128
When the vault was installed,
Mr. Decker used his abilities

40:29.174 --> 40:31.317
as an engineer to tamper
with the building's structure.

40:31.353 --> 40:35.223
Specifically, this beam that
the vault's bolts slide in to.

40:35.343 --> 40:41.019
Now, by moving this beam over, as such,

40:41.888 --> 40:44.990
the vault door simply swings open.

40:45.198 --> 40:48.724
Gentlemen, the great Houdini
and Detective Murdoch.

40:49.267 --> 40:52.188
- Ha! Ha! Ha!
- What the bloody hell he is doing here? Stop, now!

40:52.214 --> 40:55.986
Sir, I enlisted Mr. Houdini's
help as a sort of consultant.

40:56.357 --> 40:59.449
He made me see that it wasn't the
vault or the lock that were faulty.

41:00.408 --> 41:02.714
So now we know how the
robbery was executed.

41:02.732 --> 41:04.613
And we know what roles
Simms and Decker played.

41:04.649 --> 41:06.132
But what about the third man?

41:06.150 --> 41:08.872
- I believe Mr. Houdini can answer that question.
- I knew it.

41:08.992 --> 41:10.952
- Detective, you gave me your word.
- Mr. Houdini,

41:11.072 --> 41:12.688
I know that you are innocent.

41:13.032 --> 41:16.061
Please, tell me, how is
it Mr. Simms knew exactly

41:16.079 --> 41:18.087
what you were wearing that night on stage?

41:18.774 --> 41:22.175
- I don't know.
- And how is it that you, a known escape artist,

41:22.176 --> 41:25.326
happened to be performing in a
theater right next to this bank

41:25.349 --> 41:28.351
on no less than the night it
held more money than ever before?

41:28.668 --> 41:31.116
It had to be someone
who knew your schedule.

41:31.118 --> 41:33.279
But what about the poison? Are
we not looking for a chemist?

41:33.523 --> 41:35.675
No. Not a chemist.

41:35.795 --> 41:37.746
But he does have a background in science.

41:38.460 --> 41:40.920
There's only one person
it can be, isn't there?

41:41.173 --> 41:43.362
Unfortunately, yes.

41:47.984 --> 41:51.095
- Driver, to the train station!
- Yes Sir.

41:51.215 --> 41:52.696
I don't think so.

41:52.816 --> 41:54.522
What's in the bag, Mr. Romanov?

41:54.642 --> 41:56.991
152 000$ by any chance?

41:57.111 --> 41:59.758
Or perhaps a few extra
vials of liquid nicotine?

41:59.803 --> 42:01.567
I don't know what either
of you are talking about.

42:01.687 --> 42:03.212
That was your plan all along, wasn't it?

42:03.239 --> 42:05.925
Vanish with the money and leave a
trail of dead accomplices behind.

42:05.970 --> 42:07.905
Unfortunately for you, Mr. Romanov,

42:07.905 --> 42:09.344
when it comes to vanishing,

42:09.986 --> 42:11.849
you are no Harry Houdini.

42:11.849 --> 42:13.648
Come on, sunshine.

42:37.043 --> 42:39.782
Having some trouble there, Mr. Houdini?

42:40.165 --> 42:42.738
Not for long, I assure you, Sir.

42:44.321 --> 42:46.210
Have you heard back from Philadelphia yet?

42:46.229 --> 42:47.775
Yes. I spoke with the police.

42:47.811 --> 42:51.356
Apparently Leopold Romanov had
quite a history of flim-flammery.

42:51.376 --> 42:52.649
Indeed?

42:52.676 --> 42:56.213
He also spent time in jail with
one Mr. Decker and one Mr. Simms.

42:56.333 --> 42:59.061
Where they no doubt hatched this plot.

43:01.350 --> 43:03.068
You'd think now that
Houdini's been cleared,

43:03.104 --> 43:04.840
these two would get on a bit better.

43:04.867 --> 43:07.625
Inspector, these leg irons,
what have you done to them?

43:07.745 --> 43:10.636
A little trick that I like to call "glue".

43:14.950 --> 43:16.750
That's cheating, Inspector.

43:16.750 --> 43:19.888
I prefer to call it the
art of illusion, Harold.

43:22.782 --> 43:24.509
Well, I'm off now.

43:24.629 --> 43:27.149
At least we got to have
a little dinner together.

43:28.334 --> 43:31.454
A dinner, as I recall, to
which you were not invited.

43:31.574 --> 43:33.670
You really didn't have to
come that night, did you?

43:33.706 --> 43:35.949
Yes, yes I did.

43:36.988 --> 43:38.607
You were jealous.

43:38.852 --> 43:40.379
Ruby!

43:40.605 --> 43:43.626
I love you, but you always
push me just hard enough

43:43.644 --> 43:45.064
to give you what you want.

43:45.688 --> 43:47.406
You should know when it comes to William,

43:47.442 --> 43:49.242
I will not be pushed around.

43:58.656 --> 44:00.854
- Detective.
- Miss Ruby.

44:01.261 --> 44:02.966
This is good-bye.

44:03.086 --> 44:05.398
- You're off then?
- I think my story about

44:05.444 --> 44:08.301
the great Houdini would be
incomplete if I abandoned him now.

44:08.500 --> 44:11.222
And his career much
poorer for it, I'd imagine.

44:12.253 --> 44:15.409
Do try to get Jules out of
the morgue once in a while.

44:16.819 --> 44:18.591
Of course.

44:28.530 --> 44:29.842
Doctor...

44:30.683 --> 44:33.242
- Am I disrupting?
- No.

44:33.288 --> 44:34.735
Is there something you need?

44:35.051 --> 44:37.420
Well, I was hoping to
go over a case with you.

44:37.836 --> 44:39.816
Oh, I see.

44:40.485 --> 44:44.365
About a young swimmer's
blatant disregard for clothing.

44:45.251 --> 44:48.588
Might you discuss it with me over dinner?

44:49.998 --> 44:52.929
Why yes, I'd be delighted.
