00:01.302 --> 00:03.135
<i> Previously on "nashville"...</i>

00:03.137 --> 00:04.203
I'll see you
when I see you.

00:04.205 --> 00:05.504
Well, I told you we were casual.
[ chuckles ]

00:05.506 --> 00:07.172
Might be time for y'all
to sign at highway 65.

00:07.174 --> 00:09.975
With one condition --
that you do it together.

00:09.977 --> 00:12.644
Mr. Wheeler, you owe
the government $40 million.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.680
I called granddad. I'm
gonna stay with him for a while.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.482
I saw what happened
with jeff.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.450
Juliette was gonna jump,
and jeff saved her,

00:18.452 --> 00:19.718
But when he did,
he fell.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.719
Where's juliette?

00:20.721 --> 00:22.654
She had to travel
for work.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.790
I don't think
I can do this anymore.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.959
I need a producer
for my new album a.S.A.P.

00:26.961 --> 00:28.027
I want you to get me
avery barkley.

00:32.299 --> 00:33.866
[ sighs ]

00:36.170 --> 00:38.804
Hi. I'm here
to see juliette barnes.

00:38.806 --> 00:39.738
And your name is?

00:39.740 --> 00:42.307
Avery barkley.

00:42.309 --> 00:43.776
Are you a family member?

00:45.513 --> 00:47.413
I'm her husband.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.815
Belated congratulations,
by the way.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.417
Thank you so much.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.485
Hey, listen,
I'm excited about this --

00:53.487 --> 00:54.987
Y'all working together.

00:54.989 --> 00:56.321
Glenn, I've thought
for the longest time

00:56.323 --> 00:57.756
That you're
one of the best in the business.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.091
Well, thank you, rayna.

00:59.093 --> 01:01.827
And I love
these demos you sent over.

01:01.829 --> 01:04.329
You do?
Some really, really
beautiful stuff in there.

01:04.331 --> 01:06.231
Yeah.
Some of it
really heartbreaking.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.934
Well, most of it was inspired
by my relationship with jeff.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.335
Yeah, I figured.

01:10.337 --> 01:11.203
She's got some great
upbeat stuff, too.

01:11.205 --> 01:12.404
Layla's
been crazy prolific.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.839
Well, yes, she has,

01:13.841 --> 01:15.441
And let's not forget
that we do have

01:15.443 --> 01:17.776
A completely finished record
ready to be released.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.778
I know,
but my new stuff,

01:19.780 --> 01:22.181
It just --
it means so much more to me.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.016
Listen, here's
what I would propose.

01:24.018 --> 01:27.619
I'd say let's figure out a
launch date for the first record

01:27.621 --> 01:30.255
And get you
out on tour,

01:30.257 --> 01:32.124
And then if you can
commit to that,

01:32.126 --> 01:34.726
Why don't we go ahead
and start your second record?

01:34.728 --> 01:36.562
Really?
Yeah. Why not?

01:36.564 --> 01:37.963
Thank you.

01:37.965 --> 01:39.231
Do you have any idea who
you might like to produce with?

01:39.233 --> 01:42.234
Well, uh, we've reached out
to avery barkley.

01:42.236 --> 01:44.303
I'm a big fan of avery's.
How do you feel about it?

01:44.305 --> 01:49.241
I'd say that we are a...
Match made in heaven.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.243
So, uh, keep the energy up
with "borrow my heart,"

01:51.245 --> 01:52.744
Then play
"change your mind."

01:52.746 --> 01:54.913
Yeah, and if we close with
"if I didn't know better,"

01:54.915 --> 01:56.281
It's a hometown crowd.

01:56.283 --> 01:57.316
[ door opens ]
it's an oldie
but a goodie.

01:57.318 --> 01:58.617
[ cellphone rings ]
yeah.
Yeah.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.587
Ooh! It's erin.
Gimme a sec.

02:01.589 --> 02:05.457
Hey!
Missed you last night.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.625
Hey, stranger.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.127
Hey.
Where you been?

02:08.129 --> 02:10.162
[ sighs ]
out of town.

02:10.164 --> 02:11.230
It's good to see you.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.631
Good to see you, too.

02:12.633 --> 02:16.435
Yeah, I had to get away from
my so-called songwriting career.

02:16.437 --> 02:19.271
Crazy thing is, I actually
stumbled back into performing.

02:19.273 --> 02:22.241
Played in front of a crowd
without a band or a hat.
Really?

02:22.243 --> 02:25.244
Yeah, of course, I was
in the middle of nowhere
and nobody knew who I was,

02:25.246 --> 02:28.247
But, uh, it felt pretty good
doing it.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.481
As long as it feels good,
that's great.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.517
I might be ready to try
something like that around town,

02:31.519 --> 02:34.453
You know, like a little,
uh, acoustic gig here or there.

02:34.455 --> 02:36.288
We're playing
the nashville palace tonight.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.323
You want to sit in for
a couple of songs in
the middle of the set?

02:38.325 --> 02:39.691
Uh, uh, really?

02:39.693 --> 02:41.260
I mean, management wouldn't
have a problem with that?

02:41.262 --> 02:43.328
Yeah, all right.
I'll see you then.

02:43.330 --> 02:46.298
No, man.
Our set, our guests.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.666
To hell with the management.
You want to do it?

02:50.271 --> 02:52.104
Hell, yeah! All right.
All right, dude.

02:52.106 --> 02:53.438
Yeah.
[ both laugh ]

02:56.010 --> 02:57.943
I imagine we might have
a full house tonight.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.278
How many servers
you got on?

02:59.280 --> 03:01.713
We got one for happy hour,
three for prime time.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.883
And if we need more, I can get
my daughter to come in and help.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.785
Tell you what,
she's already helping me out.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.453
Maddie smiled more
in the last six weeks

03:08.455 --> 03:09.721
She did
in the previous six months.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.356
Cash is enjoying it,
too.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.692
She thinks that girl of yours
is going somewhere.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.562
Guess the trick is making sure
the right people with her

03:16.564 --> 03:17.896
Along the way, huh?

03:17.898 --> 03:19.565
Oh.
Hey, I'm sorry.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.067
We're, uh --
we're not quite open yet here.
Well, I-I know.

03:22.069 --> 03:24.036
I-I was just hoping to
get on the list for
your open mike tonight.

03:24.038 --> 03:25.571
Well, then, I'm sorry again.
That list is full.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.573
Maybe come back next week,
all right?

03:27.575 --> 03:29.308
Well, I'll probably be
back on the road by then.

03:29.310 --> 03:32.377
Um...And playing
in nashville's

03:32.379 --> 03:34.513
Always sort of been
a dream of mine, you know?

03:34.515 --> 03:36.415
Well, there's about 50 other
bars that got an open mike --

03:36.417 --> 03:37.749
Yeah, but there aren't
50 other bar owners

03:37.751 --> 03:40.185
Who actually
make their own music.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.187
I mean,
you're deacon claybourne.

03:42.189 --> 03:44.823
[ sighs ]

03:44.825 --> 03:46.491
Can I at least
audition for you?

03:46.493 --> 03:49.628
Yeah. Yeah, all right.
Okay, cool. Thanks.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.201
Flattered much?
Shut up.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.903
That's really good
for like the 9:00 hour,

03:57.905 --> 03:59.438
So when he gets here...

03:59.440 --> 04:02.441
[ telephone ringing ]

04:02.443 --> 04:04.676
Woman: L&m studios.

04:04.678 --> 04:07.045
Oh, yeah, he's expecting you.
Hang on just a moment.

04:07.047 --> 04:10.148
¶¶

04:16.890 --> 04:18.857
[ clicking ]

04:23.964 --> 04:26.565
[ cellphone chimes ]
sorry. What'd you say?

04:26.567 --> 04:28.734
I was just asking when we were
gonna see each other again.

04:28.736 --> 04:29.801
What are you doing
this weekend?

04:29.803 --> 04:31.036
A lot, actually.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.404
I've got a history paper
to write,

04:32.406 --> 04:34.306
And grandpa's got me
working on the farm most days.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.608
Colt, do you even like me
anymore?

04:36.610 --> 04:38.443
Of course I like you,
maddie.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.746
I just don't really
feel like I'm in the
mood to talk right now.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.080
Okay,
then I should just go.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.615
No, maddie. Wait.

04:58.132 --> 05:00.232
Bye.
Bye.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.272
So, how much did you know
when?

05:07.274 --> 05:08.674
Lookit, buzz,
when I'm out on the road,

05:08.676 --> 05:10.809
Uh, I tend to focus on my fans
and not my finances.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.811
That's what accountants
are for, right?
Yeah.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.280
So I was surprised as anybody
when the irs came knocking.

05:15.282 --> 05:17.282
I guess
if I'm guilty of anything,

05:17.284 --> 05:20.519
Uh, it's trusting the folks I
hired to fill out my tax forms.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.321
Yeah, but it's
all taken care of now?

05:22.323 --> 05:24.456
Yeah, well, the embezzlement
part is in the hands of the fbi,

05:24.458 --> 05:26.024
But me and the irs --
we've settled up.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.793
Wow,
that was pretty fast.
[ laughing ] yeah.

05:27.795 --> 05:30.162
Hey, we got a lot of
people who want to talk
to<i> the</i> luke wheeler,

05:30.164 --> 05:32.097
Who's gonna be at the
civic theater this weekend

05:32.099 --> 05:33.432
For the
"never look back" tour.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.934
So let's go to, uh --
let's go to mike.

05:35.936 --> 05:36.802
Hey, mike.
How you doing, bud?

05:36.804 --> 05:38.203
Mike: Uh, me?

05:38.205 --> 05:40.205
I'm living off
less than 20 grand a year.

05:40.207 --> 05:41.673
What's it like
to be so rich

05:41.675 --> 05:44.042
You don't notice
being 40 million bucks short?

05:44.044 --> 05:45.510
Whoa.
Mike's a little angry there,

05:45.512 --> 05:48.780
So, uh, why don't we try, uh --
let's try sheila in iverton.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.015
Sheila:
Long-time fan, luke.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.350
Oh, thanks, sheila.

05:51.352 --> 05:53.318
I was listening
to what you said earlier

05:53.320 --> 05:54.953
About being
a simple country boy,

05:54.955 --> 05:56.955
And I always loved that
about you.
[ chuckles ]

05:56.957 --> 05:59.891
But is it
even true anymore?

05:59.893 --> 06:01.493
I-is what true?

06:01.495 --> 06:03.061
Am I from a one-red-light town
in kentucky?

06:03.063 --> 06:04.796
Hell, yes,
and I'm proud of it.

06:04.798 --> 06:07.132
When was the last time
you were there?

06:07.134 --> 06:09.968
It's been awhile,
but, uh...

06:09.970 --> 06:12.037
I try to get back
as often as I can.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.872
You know, we should probably
take a break right now,

06:13.874 --> 06:15.340
So, uh,
stay where you are.

06:15.342 --> 06:18.377
We'll be right back with country
superstar mr. Luke wheeler.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.480
Man, I'm so sorry
about that.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.348
We'll try to weed out the haters
next round.

06:23.350 --> 06:25.584
Yeah.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.222
Excuse me.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.656
I've been waiting
for an hour,

06:31.658 --> 06:33.024
And I need
to drive back to nashville

06:33.026 --> 06:34.159
For a job I have tonight.

06:34.161 --> 06:36.661
How much longer?
Mr. Barkley?

06:36.663 --> 06:37.763
Nice to see you again.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.731
Dr. Kitley.
Hi.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.434
So, uh, is there
a visiting area,

06:42.436 --> 06:44.269
Or does juliette
just want to talk in her room?

06:44.271 --> 06:45.704
Actually...

06:45.706 --> 06:48.340
She's in a fairly delicate
emotional state at the moment

06:48.342 --> 06:49.708
And doesn't feel
that now is a safe time

06:49.710 --> 06:50.542
To be engaging with you.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.210
Okay.

06:52.212 --> 06:55.247
I have allowed her
to see our daughter.

06:55.249 --> 06:58.417
I've given her space.
I have respected her wishes.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.685
All I'm asking for
is 10 minutes just to discuss --

07:00.687 --> 07:03.288
I'm sorry, but juliette
really needs this time

07:03.290 --> 07:05.557
To focus on herself.
Oh, she needs time?!

07:05.559 --> 07:08.293
Really? Because, you know,
I've had to waste a lot of it!

07:08.295 --> 07:10.095
I've had to go around
for months

07:10.097 --> 07:11.863
Pretending like
we still have a marriage!

07:11.865 --> 07:14.533
Look, I suggest that you come
back when you've calmed down.

07:14.535 --> 07:15.867
[ sighs ]

07:15.869 --> 07:18.036
The last thing juliette needs
now is this kind of drama.

Frankie:
Terry mcgrath, everybody!

07:35.923 --> 07:36.922
[ cheers and applause ]

07:36.924 --> 07:39.057
Make your daddy proud, son.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.426
I tell you what, that's
one of the finest
songwriters out there.

07:41.428 --> 07:42.561
Oh, hey.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.930
Glad you made it.
Hi. Mm, me too.

07:44.932 --> 07:47.599
Well, I haven't you that
over the moon about an artist

07:47.601 --> 07:48.733
In quite some time.

07:48.735 --> 07:50.335
I tell you what,
we were auditioning her.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.170
She opened her mouth,
I was like, "rayna's
got to hear this voice."

07:52.172 --> 07:53.405
So what's her story?

07:53.407 --> 07:56.308
I don't know other than
she's just kind of great.

07:56.310 --> 07:59.444
Please welcome
to the stage miss vita martin.

07:59.446 --> 08:00.345
This is her.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.347
[ applause ]

08:04.518 --> 08:06.952
Um...

08:06.954 --> 08:08.587
This song I wrote
when I was 15.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.489
I think it still holds up.

08:17.798 --> 08:21.366
¶ lost another penny,
could've thrown in my bucket ¶

08:21.368 --> 08:24.970
¶ lost another dime,
I sunk it deep in your pocket ¶

08:24.972 --> 08:29.474
¶ shake it, shake it now
and then move on down the line ¶

08:29.476 --> 08:30.308
I see why you called.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.010
Yeah?

08:32.012 --> 08:35.680
¶ why'd you have to steal
my only four-leaf clover? ¶

08:35.682 --> 08:39.451
¶ thought I was in love,
but maybe now I'm getting over ¶

08:39.453 --> 08:44.456
¶ you and all your doggies
better move on down the line ¶

08:44.458 --> 08:47.292

08:47.294 --> 08:51.396
¶ I won't cry
if you'll say goodbye ¶

08:51.398 --> 08:53.665
It's a sound
we don't have.

08:53.667 --> 08:57.502
¶ 'cause if you're out of sight,
you're out of my mind ¶
that's a sound nobody has.

08:57.504 --> 09:00.705
¶ I'll be feeling better
once I find your love letters ¶

09:00.707 --> 09:04.209
¶ move it farther on
down the line ¶

09:06.680 --> 09:08.980
How about all these people,
huh?

09:08.982 --> 09:10.715
Yeah, it's amazing.
Let's go put on a show.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.217
What's going on?

09:12.219 --> 09:14.052
What do you mean?

09:14.054 --> 09:16.488
You had a weird look
on your face.
Uh, it's just my face.

09:16.490 --> 09:17.889
No, no, there's --
there's something.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.257
What is it?
Just forget it.
I'll tell you later.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.059
Oh, so there
is an "it."

09:21.061 --> 09:23.328
How can I forget an "it"
if there is no "it"?

09:23.330 --> 09:25.030
I don't want to talk about it
right now.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.364
Let's go do the show.
No, you know what?

09:26.366 --> 09:27.699
If there's a problem,
I'm not getting on the stage

09:27.701 --> 09:28.733
Till you tell me
what it is.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.402
Just tell me, okay?

09:30.404 --> 09:34.239
I saw erin kissing some
other guy in the parking lot.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.508
Like, really kissing him.

09:36.510 --> 09:37.409
Oh.

09:37.411 --> 09:38.677
I'm sorry.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.179
No, it's -- it's fine.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.548
We should
just start the show.

09:43.550 --> 09:44.950
Uh, yeah.

09:44.952 --> 09:49.721
¶ ooh ooh ooh ¶

09:49.723 --> 09:50.889
Was that okay?

09:50.891 --> 09:52.958
That was better
than okay.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.560
I mean, I think we finally found
the right phrasing there.

09:55.562 --> 09:56.695
You want to keep going?

09:56.697 --> 09:57.696
Uh, actually,
I could use a little water.

09:57.698 --> 10:00.098
Oh. Yeah.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.433
I'll go grab a few bottles
for us.

10:01.435 --> 10:02.467
Thanks, man.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.302
[ sighs ]

10:04.304 --> 10:06.137
Layla,
your voice is amazing.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.739
Thank you.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.874
I can't believe how
much progress we're
making on the track.

10:09.876 --> 10:11.242
I know, right?

10:11.244 --> 10:12.811
Usually, uh, it takes time
to find a rhythm

10:12.813 --> 10:15.280
When you're recording, but
day one's been pretty smooth.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.749
It helps me a lot
that you're a musician.

10:17.751 --> 10:21.753
It makes your producing style
both gentle and commanding.

10:21.755 --> 10:24.456
Well, I don't know about
commanding, but thanks.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.957
Seriously.

10:25.959 --> 10:29.794
There's not a lot of guys
like that in this business.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.998
Juliette's really lucky
that she has you.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.235
I just want
to take a second here.
[ laughs ]

10:37.237 --> 10:40.105
Vita martin, there's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.339
Oh, my god.
You're rayna jaymes.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.841
Hello.
It's so good to meet you.

10:42.843 --> 10:46.111
This is bucky dawes,
the head of a&r at highway 65.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.146
Pleasure to meet you.
Likewise.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.581
I'll let y'all talk.

10:49.583 --> 10:52.784
So, we just saw you play,
and, girl, you are incredible.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.986
You really have a lot to say.
I can tell.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.287
And I'd love to sit down
and talk to you,

10:56.289 --> 10:57.322
Talk to you
about the label,

10:57.324 --> 10:58.790
And get to know you
a little bit.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.825
Is this for real?

11:00.827 --> 11:02.160
Yes, we'd like to find out
what you've done,

11:02.162 --> 11:03.161
Where you've played.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.496
Well, I've been
playing forever,

11:04.498 --> 11:05.864
And I --
and I've dreamt of this,

11:05.866 --> 11:07.132
But, um, mostly
I just played for --

11:07.134 --> 11:08.133
For fun, right?

11:08.135 --> 11:09.367
For that, yeah.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.769
And, uh,
and because I can.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.871
I can't not, you know?

11:12.873 --> 11:14.706
Um, it's my escape.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.374
Some people, they --
they drink, they do drugs.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.543
I play my guitar.
Healthier choice, but...

11:18.545 --> 11:19.377
[ chuckles ]

11:19.379 --> 11:20.845
Listen,
I'd love for you

11:20.847 --> 11:22.781
To come by the offices
at highway 65.

11:22.783 --> 11:23.682
Bucky can set it up.

11:23.684 --> 11:24.716
That would be awesome.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.885
How about next week?

11:26.887 --> 11:28.286
Does that
not work for you?

11:28.288 --> 11:30.388
No, no, it's just --
no, I-I'm beyond stoked.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.390
I was just hoping...

11:32.392 --> 11:34.492
You know,
it's not your problem.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.161
I'm just gonna do
what I have to do anyway.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.462
Which was what?

11:37.464 --> 11:39.731
Is find a job that --
that lets me do this.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.666
We might be able to help you
with that.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.902
You know, I'm very tight with
the guy who owns this place.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.670
[ chuckles ]

11:45.672 --> 11:48.173
Let's try "longing"
instead.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.508
You know,
it's a more deeply felt lyric.

11:50.510 --> 11:53.745
I hate to say it,
but...

11:53.747 --> 11:55.880
I feel like that's something
you need to work on a bit.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.749
What?

11:57.751 --> 12:01.720
It's like you're holding back
or maybe you're being held back.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.521
I'm not sure which,

12:03.523 --> 12:06.825
But you are so much more mature
than you think, maddie.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.227
You can't be afraid
of going deeper,

12:09.229 --> 12:10.929
Letting what you're feeling
come out,

12:10.931 --> 12:12.731
Even if it's painful
or scary

12:12.733 --> 12:14.499
Or if it bugs
the hell out of you.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.267
Colt and I
went all the way.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.038
Wow.

12:20.040 --> 12:23.908
And now he's just being
a complete weirdo to me.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.611
Like he barely
wants to talk anymore.

12:26.613 --> 12:28.913
[ voice breaking ] you probably
think I'm a terrible person now.

12:28.915 --> 12:32.283
I'm too young and
I'm just a stupid, little girl.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.920
I absolutely...

12:35.922 --> 12:38.022
Hey.

12:38.024 --> 12:40.291
I do not think
any of those things.

12:40.293 --> 12:43.695
Maddie, you're allowed
to make mistakes in life,

12:43.697 --> 12:46.531
And you are allowed
to have feelings about them.

12:46.533 --> 12:47.532
[ sighs ]

12:47.534 --> 12:48.900
More than that,

12:48.902 --> 12:52.036
You are allowed
to stand up for yourself.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.772
You deserve respect.

12:56.977 --> 13:00.478
You know what sucks for guys
that date girls like us?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.280
[ scoffs ] what?

13:02.282 --> 13:04.949
We get to write songs
about them.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.317
[ chuckles ]

13:06.319 --> 13:08.453
[ sniffles ]

13:10.223 --> 13:11.956
[ sighs ]

13:11.958 --> 13:13.424
[ knock on door ]

13:13.426 --> 13:15.326
You got a minute?
Please.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.395
Anything to get my mind
off all this online hate.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.664
Uh, not sure
this'll help, then.

13:19.666 --> 13:20.665
Fine. Lay it on me.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.100
[ sighs ]

13:22.102 --> 13:23.835
Well, just heard
from our booking agent.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.271
Ticket sales for the next leg
are down.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.473
And with dierks bentley's
guest dates with us ending,

13:28.475 --> 13:30.475
We're looking
at a financial hit.

13:30.477 --> 13:34.179
Why are my fans
so quick to turn on me?

13:34.181 --> 13:35.980
I'm not the one
who did anything wrong.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.315
I'm the same guy
I always was.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.150
Look, to get things
back on track,

13:39.152 --> 13:40.785
We have to find a way
to fill seats.

13:40.787 --> 13:42.086
Well, I'm all ears,
kenneth.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.855
What about juliette?

13:43.857 --> 13:45.690
She was
your original tour mate,

13:45.692 --> 13:47.425
And people
are talking oscars.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.494
She's bigger
than she's ever been.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.929
Yeah.

13:50.931 --> 13:55.700
I mean, at this point,
um, maybe she's our best bet.

13:55.702 --> 13:58.203
We're gonna bring a very special
guest up on stage tonight

13:58.205 --> 13:59.637
To share a few songs.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.339
Please put
your hands together

14:01.341 --> 14:03.608
For our friend,
mr. Will lexington!

14:03.610 --> 14:07.879
[ cheers and applause ]

14:07.881 --> 14:09.647
Will:
How y'all doing?

14:09.649 --> 14:12.150
Well, like the xs, I've been
doing a lot of traveling myself.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.952
Where'd you go,
sweetheart? 'frisco?

14:13.954 --> 14:17.388
[ crowd murmuring ]

14:17.390 --> 14:19.724
Kentucky, actually.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.292
Anyway, um...

14:21.294 --> 14:24.295
I'm excited to perform
some new material for you.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.296
Woman: Love you, will!
This one's called --

14:25.298 --> 14:26.865
We already got
a "queen" of country!

14:26.867 --> 14:29.734
[ crowd murmurs louder ]

14:30.737 --> 14:32.070
Just ignore him, man.

14:34.307 --> 14:37.308
This is...
"ain't it beautiful."

14:40.413 --> 14:41.980
Oh, man.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.185
Excuse me.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.653
You think
you can keep him quiet?

14:48.655 --> 14:49.854
Yes, ma'am.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.723
Thank you.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.858
Ain't right.
¶ you come into the world ¶

14:53.860 --> 14:55.827
¶ cold and broke ¶

14:55.829 --> 14:59.097
¶ helpless, naked,
scared, and screaming ¶

14:59.099 --> 15:00.832
Get off the stage,
queer!

15:00.834 --> 15:04.369
Come on, wooten.
Let him play.

15:04.371 --> 15:08.573
¶ they cut and slap and stick
and scrub you down ¶

15:08.575 --> 15:11.843
¶ stand around
and watch you sleeping ¶

he's played enough.

Somebody grab that guy!

15:30.430 --> 15:31.296
Ah.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.563
Aah!

15:32.565 --> 15:33.765
Hurts worse
than getting hit.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.733
Bottle caught you
right across the bridge,

15:35.735 --> 15:37.068
Broke it pretty good.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.237
Laceration's
not too bad, though.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.205
Definitely miss the days

15:41.207 --> 15:43.141
When all I got thrown at me
were panties.

15:43.143 --> 15:46.311
That ain't funny.
None of this is funny.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.645
Detective hantz.

15:47.647 --> 15:48.746
If it's any consolation,

15:48.748 --> 15:50.448
Your attacker could be
in big trouble.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.483
Well, he doesn't seem
too worried about it.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.385
We'll see you tomorrow, boys.
[ men laugh ]

15:54.387 --> 15:56.087
Probably not his first time
in handcuffs.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.623
No, but it's his first time
facing a felony hate crime.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.458
I understand he shouted
gay slurs at you?

16:00.460 --> 16:02.327
Damn right he did.
Everybody heard him.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.662
Well, I need
to hear that from him.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.331
Need you
to come into the station,

16:06.333 --> 16:07.999
File a statement,
get you some justice.

16:08.001 --> 16:11.502
If that's what it takes
to get it.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.174
Daphne's already asleep.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.642
Oh, good.
Made you some tea.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.943
Thank you.

16:18.945 --> 16:21.346
Maddie's awake,
but she apologizes

16:21.348 --> 16:22.847
And says she'll go to bed
in 10 minutes.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.349
Maddie apologized?
I know, right?

16:24.351 --> 16:25.850
[ both chuckle ]
I don't know
what that cash is doing.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.285
Whatever it is,
we got to bottle it

16:27.287 --> 16:28.853
And sell it to parents
of teenagers everywhere.

16:28.855 --> 16:31.322
Maybe she just
needed a creative outlet.
Mm-hmm.

16:31.324 --> 16:34.292
I mean, besides
from her sister and her parents,

16:34.294 --> 16:35.960
Which is always
a loaded situation.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.528
Yeah.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.330
Sometimes you just need
a little outside help, I guess.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.865
Yeah.

16:40.867 --> 16:43.134
You know, I cannot stop
thinking about vita.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.302
That voice, right?

16:44.304 --> 16:46.170
I want to work with her.
[ chuckles ]

16:46.172 --> 16:48.272
But, you know,
now I've got all these big names

16:48.274 --> 16:50.508
Wanting to sign with highway 65,
which, of course,

16:50.510 --> 16:54.112
Can be a lot more lucrative
and easier in some ways,

16:54.114 --> 16:57.115
Although markus proved
not always.
Yeah.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.017
There's just something
about her talent.

16:59.019 --> 17:00.551
It's really unique.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.487
And you know
I love an underdog.

17:02.489 --> 17:04.188
Yeah, I'd heard that
about you.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.991
I think she's coming off
some hard times and needs a job.

17:06.993 --> 17:08.192
You got anything
at the beverly?

17:08.194 --> 17:10.228
I mean, frankie's
in charge of the hiring,

17:10.230 --> 17:12.697
But I don't think
that should be a problem.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.832
You know, it is so nice
having friends in high places.

I thought we agreed
we're casual.

casual meant not monogamous.

Hey.

18:17.030 --> 18:19.597
I like what we have.

28:04.784 --> 28:08.352
If I had filled out the form,
then I would have had to say...

28:08.354 --> 28:09.953
I've been arrested before.

28:09.955 --> 28:11.488
I see.

28:11.490 --> 28:16.193
Look, I've done some things
I'm not real proud of.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.395
But I'm not
that girl anymore.

28:18.397 --> 28:19.797
That's why I'm here
in nashville.

28:19.799 --> 28:22.700
'cause the only thing
I've ever been good at...

28:22.702 --> 28:24.535
And the only thing that's
helped me get through my life

28:24.537 --> 28:25.803
Is music.

28:25.805 --> 28:28.038
You and me both.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.808
Listen, I-I don't know
what your experience is.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.376
I have my own version
of a messy life,

28:32.378 --> 28:35.012
And the one thing
that's gotten me where I am

28:35.014 --> 28:36.847
Is people
taking chances on me,

28:36.849 --> 28:38.816
So I take chances
on people.

28:38.818 --> 28:41.652
I take risks, you know?

28:41.654 --> 28:44.188
I think
you're real talented.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.356
Why don't you go on back
to the beverly?

28:46.358 --> 28:48.158
Fill that out.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.827
And see what happens.

28:52.164 --> 28:53.397
Thank you.

28:53.399 --> 28:54.998
Yeah.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Riff: This is
our first tour together,

28:57.002 --> 28:58.769
And you cannot
imagine my joy

28:58.771 --> 29:00.871
When I learned that this
kentucky boy here

29:00.873 --> 29:02.439
Had never been
on a snipe hunt.

29:02.441 --> 29:03.841
What's a snipe?

29:03.843 --> 29:06.376
Oh, it's an imaginary bird
invented by mean people

29:06.378 --> 29:08.879
Who enjoy
humiliating their friends.

29:08.881 --> 29:09.680
Then how
do you hunt it?

29:09.682 --> 29:11.081
Exactly.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.716
So my good,
old buddy luke here,

29:12.718 --> 29:14.618
He's about a 12-pack in
at this point,

29:14.620 --> 29:16.954
Crawling through a creek bed,
when "ka-kaaah!"

29:16.956 --> 29:18.922
[ laughs ]
he jumps about five foot
in the air,

29:18.924 --> 29:21.091
Lands face first
in the mud.
Yep.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.527
Clearly that story took place
before I came along.

29:23.529 --> 29:24.795
Well, thank goodness
you did,

29:24.797 --> 29:26.029
Or who knows what would have
happened to this one?

29:26.031 --> 29:28.198
Oh, hear that?
I saved you.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.600
[ chuckles ]

29:32.805 --> 29:35.372
Man, it's, um...

29:35.374 --> 29:37.474
Hard to believe
where all the time goes.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.810
But, uh, let me just say
you've done a heck of a job

29:39.812 --> 29:40.711
Raising these two.

29:40.713 --> 29:42.246
Oh, thank you.

29:42.248 --> 29:45.816
So, what are colt and sage
up to these days?

29:45.818 --> 29:50.921
Oh, well, um, sage --
she mostly stays at her mom's,

29:50.923 --> 29:52.623
And, uh, colt --

29:52.625 --> 29:54.925
He came out on the road with me
for a little bit,

29:54.927 --> 29:58.328
But, uh, he just decided
he wanted to go stay

29:58.330 --> 30:00.063
With his grandpa
for a little while, so...

30:03.002 --> 30:04.635
Hey.
Come with me.

30:04.637 --> 30:06.003
Let me show you
something I found today.

30:06.005 --> 30:08.472
Yeah.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.674
We agreed to background checks
on all employees.

30:10.676 --> 30:12.409
Yeah, one that neither of us
could pass.

30:12.411 --> 30:13.811
All right,
come on now.

30:13.813 --> 30:17.080
I know you got more than one
d.U.I. On that record of yours.

30:17.082 --> 30:18.749
And me?

30:18.751 --> 30:20.484
You're a damn disaster
on paper.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.620
[ chuckles ]

30:23.622 --> 30:25.422
It's what I'm saying.

30:25.424 --> 30:26.990
All right.

30:26.992 --> 30:28.192
You're a good man,

30:37.970 --> 30:39.837
Thank you.

30:39.839 --> 30:42.372
Man, I remember thinking
you were a fool

30:42.374 --> 30:45.542
Stepping away when you did,
on top of it all.

30:45.544 --> 30:49.146
Although you did clear a space
on top of the charts for me.

30:49.148 --> 30:50.280

30:53.519 --> 30:56.453

two nights in a row.

30:56.455 --> 30:58.355
You ever miss it?

30:58.357 --> 30:59.723
Well, it's hard not to.

30:59.725 --> 31:02.860
But that lifestyle
and especially back then,

31:02.862 --> 31:04.828
That long distance,
it was all just too much

31:04.830 --> 31:06.363
With heidi
and the kids.

31:06.365 --> 31:09.900
Well, turns out
you were the smart one.

31:09.902 --> 31:13.070
Uh, you chose
what matters most.

31:13.072 --> 31:16.974
Hey, luke,
I known you a long time.

31:16.976 --> 31:19.810
And you might have made
a few wrong turns along the way,

31:19.812 --> 31:21.411
But I tell you this.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.480
You're still the same good guy
you always were,

31:23.482 --> 31:25.015
And that's
the straight truth.

31:25.017 --> 31:27.918
Oh, boy, I need to hear that.
[ chuckles ]

31:34.159 --> 31:37.594
Listen,
let me ask you something.

31:37.596 --> 31:40.097
What would you think about
coming out of retirement

31:40.099 --> 31:41.098
And going on the road
with me?

31:41.100 --> 31:44.067
[ chuckles ]
you're out of your mind.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.570
It'll be just like old times,
minus the --

31:46.572 --> 31:48.272
The partying
and the women.

31:48.274 --> 31:52.709
Just, you know, you and me
up on stage just...

31:52.711 --> 31:54.278
Tearing it up.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.680
I'd have to discuss it
with the family.

31:56.682 --> 31:57.581

Colt: Hello?
You owe me an apology.

32:03.956 --> 32:06.056
What?
You've been weird
and distant with me

32:06.058 --> 32:07.958
Ever since we had sex,
and it's not okay.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.426
I don't know
if you regret it

32:09.428 --> 32:11.962
Or if you're embarrassed by it
or if you're just over it,

32:11.964 --> 32:13.563
But if you want
to stay together at all,

32:13.565 --> 32:15.432
Then you need to treat me
with some more respect.

32:18.070 --> 32:21.438
[ knock on door, door opens ]

32:21.440 --> 32:24.074
Is it still a booty call
when you're monogamous,

32:24.076 --> 32:26.243
Or is there
a more elegant term?

32:26.245 --> 32:27.711
Erin...

32:27.713 --> 32:28.812
We need to talk.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.783
Before you say anything...

32:32.785 --> 32:34.584
I'm sorry, okay?

32:34.586 --> 32:36.320
This sounds messed up,

32:36.322 --> 32:39.556
But part of the reason
I was with the other guy,

32:39.558 --> 32:43.994
The reason
I'm the way that I am...

32:43.996 --> 32:46.797
Is because I don't want
to get hurt,

32:46.799 --> 32:48.231
Because I have been.

32:48.233 --> 32:53.003
And I like you,
gunnar, a lot.

32:53.005 --> 32:55.272
And that
kind of scares me.

32:55.274 --> 32:59.476
So I guess that's why
I did what I did --

32:59.478 --> 33:04.982
To protect myself from feeling
what I'm feeling...

33:04.984 --> 33:07.351
About you.

33:07.353 --> 33:10.253
You know what
I should be feeling?

33:10.255 --> 33:12.589
Jealous.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.124
But I'm not.

33:14.126 --> 33:18.662
I wish I did,
but that tells me something.

33:18.664 --> 33:23.967
It tells you
that I'm not the one.

33:23.969 --> 33:26.470
Look, erin,
I-I really, really like you.

33:26.472 --> 33:29.873
No, I-I get it.

33:29.875 --> 33:32.676
I mean, it sucks.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.778
But I get it.

You're a really good man,

33:39.318 --> 33:41.885
Someone's gonna be real lucky
to have you.

33:41.887 --> 33:44.955

38:04.082 --> 38:08.752
I feel relieved, scared,

38:08.754 --> 38:10.887
A little resentful, too.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.555
I just can't help feeling

38:12.557 --> 38:16.326
Like juliette destroyed the life
that I thought I would have.

38:16.328 --> 38:19.095
Me too.

38:19.097 --> 38:22.565
I-I just mean I understand
what you're saying

38:22.567 --> 38:25.502
About losing
a life with someone.

38:25.504 --> 38:29.739
Listen, I-I don't mean to be
insensitive to your loss.

38:29.741 --> 38:33.410
I mean, I certainly
had my issues with jeff,

38:33.412 --> 38:35.812
But I know you loved him.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.648
It's pretty impressive,
you know,

38:38.650 --> 38:41.951
How you've been
able to bounce back.

38:41.953 --> 38:45.488
I had to find something
to live for, you know?

38:45.490 --> 38:48.124
Lately that's been being here
with you...

38:48.126 --> 38:49.926
Making music.

38:49.928 --> 38:52.295
Well, then, uh...
[ chuckles ]

38:52.297 --> 38:54.097
Maybe we should
get back to it.

38:54.099 --> 38:56.800
[ chuckles ]

38:56.802 --> 38:59.069
[ sighs ]

39:02.274 --> 39:04.507
[ cheers and applause ]

39:04.509 --> 39:06.009
Thank you.

39:06.011 --> 39:08.778
Thanks for letting my music
do the talking tonight.

39:11.817 --> 39:14.117
Whoo!
[ chuckles ]

39:14.119 --> 39:15.885
I am so glad
he came here to sing

39:15.887 --> 39:17.187
And not kick
that guy's ass.

39:17.189 --> 39:17.954
You and me both.

39:17.956 --> 39:20.190
[ both chuckle ]

39:20.192 --> 39:21.458
Um, are you okay?

39:21.460 --> 39:23.059
Did you sort
the thing out with erin?

39:23.061 --> 39:25.528
Uh...No.
We broke up.

39:25.530 --> 39:26.896
Oh, no.
I shouldn't have said anything.

39:26.898 --> 39:27.997
No, I'm glad you did.

39:27.999 --> 39:29.899
Erin sleeping
with that guy,

39:29.901 --> 39:32.736
It bothered me,
but it didn't hurt me.

39:32.738 --> 39:34.204
You know what I mean?

39:34.206 --> 39:35.972
No.
Well,
I want to be hurt.

39:35.974 --> 39:37.474
I mean,
I don't want to be hurt,

39:37.476 --> 39:39.042
But I want to feel,
you know,

39:39.044 --> 39:41.644
Or at least feel enough
about a person to be busted up

39:41.646 --> 39:43.880
If they cheat or --
or leave.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.082
Yeah.

39:46.084 --> 39:48.017
I don't want to just
be casual with somebody.

39:48.019 --> 39:50.387
I want to...

39:50.389 --> 39:51.488
Love them.

39:53.692 --> 39:56.159
Somebody's waiting on me.
I got to go. I'll see you later.

39:56.161 --> 39:58.094
Yeah? Hot date?

39:58.096 --> 39:59.562
It's a date.

39:59.564 --> 40:01.931
Who with?

40:01.933 --> 40:04.501
Taxidermy guy from the wedding.
Don't say nothing about it.

40:07.706 --> 40:09.139
[ cellphone rings ]

40:12.210 --> 40:14.844
Hey. Wouldn't peg you
for a facetimer.

40:14.846 --> 40:16.212
[<i> chuckles</i> ]<i> oh, yeah.</i>
<i>Yeah, now here -- here's a tip.</i>

40:16.214 --> 40:18.214
You got to hold that camera
higher,

40:18.216 --> 40:20.016
'cause I'm seeing more than one
of your chins at this angle.

40:20.018 --> 40:21.584
<i> Shut up.</i>

40:21.586 --> 40:23.787
Hey, listen, I hope
it's not too late to call,

40:23.789 --> 40:25.622
But, uh,
I talked with heidi,

40:25.624 --> 40:28.291
<i> And we've discussed it</i>
<i> with the kids, and...</i>

40:28.293 --> 40:29.692
[<i> sighs</i> ]<i> well, I'm in.</i>

40:29.694 --> 40:31.394
Oh, man,
that is great news!

40:31.396 --> 40:33.530
<i> Yeah, but on one condition,</i>
<i> though, all right?</i>

40:33.532 --> 40:35.465
<i> We're all coming,</i>
<i> the entire bell clan.</i>

40:35.467 --> 40:36.599
That's even better.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.601
I'll set plans
in motion right away.

40:38.603 --> 40:41.805
Gonna be a family affair.
Isn't that right, guys?

40:41.807 --> 40:42.772
Hey.
<i> Hey.</i>

40:42.774 --> 40:44.274
<i> We're excited.</i>

40:44.276 --> 40:45.308
<i> All right,</i>
<i> have a good night, luke.</i>

40:45.310 --> 40:46.843
Yeah, okay.
We'll see you.

40:54.486 --> 40:56.319
[ sighs ]

40:59.157 --> 41:01.491
So, tables are wiped down,
I stocked up the glasses,

41:01.493 --> 41:03.726
And I got this bit of empties
to take out to recycle.

41:03.728 --> 41:04.661
Is there anything else?

41:04.663 --> 41:06.496
I think we're good.

41:06.498 --> 41:08.631
Just sit that down
and go on home.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.333
Deacon already split?

41:10.335 --> 41:12.802
Yeah, he's the family man,
not me.

41:12.804 --> 41:15.071
Can you tell him thank you
for me?

41:15.073 --> 41:16.773
And thank you, too,
frankie.

41:16.775 --> 41:18.508
You've earned your keep.

41:18.510 --> 41:19.642
[ chuckles ]

41:19.644 --> 41:20.810
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.078
Yeah, I'll see you.

41:24.316 --> 41:26.850
[ chuckles ]

41:26.852 --> 41:28.618
Hey.

41:28.620 --> 41:29.652
Hey.

41:29.654 --> 41:31.488
Did I wake you?
Mnh.

41:31.490 --> 41:34.123
[ both chuckle ]

41:34.125 --> 41:35.291
How'd it go tonight?

41:35.293 --> 41:36.426
It was good. Yeah.

41:36.428 --> 41:37.927
It was the best night
since the opening.

41:37.929 --> 41:39.162
Oh, great.
Yeah.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.163
I tell you
something else, too.

41:40.165 --> 41:42.332
That vita
is a hard worker.

41:42.334 --> 41:43.967
I love it.

41:43.969 --> 41:46.102
I know she's so grateful.

41:46.104 --> 41:49.272
Frankie's not too keen
on the whole thing.
Really?

41:49.274 --> 41:51.641
Well, you know, with
her background and all that,

41:51.643 --> 41:53.142
Guess when
you got a small business,

41:53.144 --> 41:54.677
You got to think
about those things, right?

41:54.679 --> 41:56.513
I think she's
worth the risk, though.

41:56.515 --> 41:57.547
I think so.

41:57.549 --> 41:59.816
She keeps working this hard,
definitely.

41:59.818 --> 42:02.385
[ cellphone rings ]

42:02.387 --> 42:05.488
Well, speak of the devil,
there's frankie now.

42:05.490 --> 42:06.990
Hey, man, what's up?

42:06.992 --> 42:10.326
I hate to say I told you so,
partner, but I told you so.

42:10.328 --> 42:11.694
Hold on, frankie.
What you talking about?

42:11.696 --> 42:14.531
Somebody made off
with $500 from the till tonight.

42:14.533 --> 42:16.466
I think we both know
who took it.

42:16.468 --> 42:18.134
[ sighs ]

42:18.136 --> 42:19.402
Vita.
