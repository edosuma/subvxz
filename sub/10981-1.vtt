02:32.062 --> 02:35.190
<i>This has been America News
Radio from Washington.</i>

02:35.365 --> 02:38.960
<i>Now back to your local
ANR station for news on the hour.</i>

02:39.970 --> 02:46.136
<i>Good evening. You're listening
to 108.9 FM, KMZR, Portland. This...</i>

03:02.893 --> 03:04.053
Evening, ma'am.

04:05.022 --> 04:06.751
You, too.

04:16.132 --> 04:17.600
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

04:17.767 --> 04:20.236
- Careful. Careful, it's hot.
- Thank you.

04:20.404 --> 04:23.703
- Busy night for the bad guys?
- Even busier night for us.

04:30.313 --> 04:32.508
Okay.

04:32.816 --> 04:34.909
Let's see what you got for me.

04:39.689 --> 04:42.658
Oh, hey,
because you're dying to know...

04:42.826 --> 04:46.922
...l'm almost positive my first date last
night is eligible for the hall of fame.

04:49.299 --> 04:52.132
She was amazing.
She looked exactly like her photo.

04:52.402 --> 04:53.801
You'll never see her again.

04:53.970 --> 04:57.133
- How do you know?
- Because you look nothing like yours.

04:58.408 --> 05:00.103
Nice one.

05:16.960 --> 05:20.157
- Here's that guy I was telling you about.
- Oh, yeah?

05:20.330 --> 05:23.390
He changes his name every day.
It's taken me a week to isolate him.

05:23.567 --> 05:25.194
Listen to this.

05:26.336 --> 05:29.134
- Tunethief.com.
- Oh, how original.

05:29.806 --> 05:32.001
Yeah, he offers free downloads
of pirated music.

05:32.175 --> 05:34.370
I'm running this
in a fake virtual machine.

05:34.544 --> 05:36.808
Watch what happens
when I accept his offer.

05:37.981 --> 05:40.472
Now, he's stealing my financial data...

05:40.784 --> 05:42.615
...and all my passwords.

05:43.320 --> 05:46.221
Which I happened to have gathered
in a file called "passwords."

05:46.389 --> 05:48.152
Nice touch.

05:48.492 --> 05:51.893
I threw in a backdoor Trojan so
we can see what he's doing with it.

05:52.062 --> 05:55.225
He's run up a quarter-million dollars
in fraud the past three weeks.

05:55.398 --> 05:58.697
- Well, what's he into?
- High-end tech and low-end porn.

05:58.869 --> 06:03.135
God. You sure it's a guy? If it's
a woman, she could be my soul mate.

06:03.306 --> 06:04.739
Send it over to me.

06:06.076 --> 06:07.839
There you go.

06:08.278 --> 06:10.542
My dummy Capital One card.
Hope he goes for it.

06:10.714 --> 06:11.874
Okay, I see it.

06:14.317 --> 06:17.115
I'm surprised he has
the patience for auctions.

06:17.921 --> 06:21.413
- Oh, you've got him now.
- Okay, there's his IP address.

06:21.892 --> 06:23.484
Let's get his physical one.

06:23.660 --> 06:26.857
Portland Police sent this over.
They weren't sure what to do with it.

06:27.030 --> 06:28.520
Thank you.

06:29.733 --> 06:32.201
- It is a woman.
- ER nurse, lives alone.

06:33.603 --> 06:35.867
No priors,
no history of online purchases.

06:36.039 --> 06:37.768
It's not her. Gotta be a neighbor...

06:37.941 --> 06:41.604
...somebody close by, someone
who could access her wireless router.

06:41.778 --> 06:44.770
Sharon Dobbs lives here.

06:45.148 --> 06:48.049
All right. Here we go,
here's somebody.

06:49.686 --> 06:53.452
Sam Barrows. He's a computer
programmer for the school district.

06:53.623 --> 06:55.523
He's lived there six weeks.
He's a renter.

06:55.692 --> 06:58.684
He's registered for three handguns
and two assault rifles.

06:58.862 --> 06:59.886
That's your guy.

07:00.063 --> 07:02.998
Jennifer Marsh, FBI Cyber Crimes
up in Portland.

07:03.166 --> 07:05.430
We need you to knock down
a door for us.

07:22.619 --> 07:25.247
Oh, I gotta get reassigned.

07:25.655 --> 07:27.316
What's the matter?

07:27.490 --> 07:29.822
It's just a sickness. It's just too much.

07:29.993 --> 07:32.120
I got this
retired high school principal...

07:32.295 --> 07:34.559
...offering to come over
to where I'm babysitting.

07:34.731 --> 07:37.359
He's got so many chats,
he can't keep his names straight.

07:37.534 --> 07:39.729
He keeps calling me Jill
instead of Molly.

07:39.903 --> 07:42.963
I'm only interested in what his
cellmates are gonna call him.

07:43.139 --> 07:44.936
I'm taking a break. Do you want?

07:45.108 --> 07:47.576
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:07.397 --> 08:08.455
All right.

08:23.480 --> 08:27.143
I see feet! Get your hands up!
Get your hands up!

08:27.317 --> 08:30.013
On your stomach! On your stomach!

08:47.103 --> 08:49.196
<i>- on flawless, cut Natalie K diamonds.</i>

08:49.372 --> 08:53.502
<i>Huge savings on one-karat diamonds.

08:57.514 --> 09:00.415
- What the hell is this?
- I don't know. I'm running it down now.

09:00.583 --> 09:01.880
It is streaming live.

09:02.052 --> 09:04.520
Just when you thought
you've seen it all.

09:04.888 --> 09:07.413
Oh, look, a message from our sponsor.

09:07.590 --> 09:10.582
"Ha-ha. Only serious."

09:13.596 --> 09:14.927
Jennifer Marsh, Cyber Crimes.

09:15.332 --> 09:18.665
Carter Thompson here.
I'm at the Barrow residence.

09:19.135 --> 09:22.161
The suspect's in custody.
Hard drive's intact.

09:22.339 --> 09:26.366
<i>- Plenty of contraband.
- Good work. Hey, let me guess.</i>

09:26.543 --> 09:29.808
It's not just Barrow. His son's
involved. He's got a son?

09:29.979 --> 09:31.446
<i>What makes you say that?</i>

09:31.614 --> 09:34.014
Well, high-tech toys and porn...

09:34.217 --> 09:36.947
...and then out of the blue,
he buys a gold wristwatch.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.054
How come? And then it hit me.

09:39.222 --> 09:43.784
01-10-57.
Sunday's his father's birthday.

09:45.061 --> 09:46.892
Sweet dreams, Marsh.

09:52.936 --> 09:53.960
<i>Good morning.</i>

09:54.137 --> 09:57.629
<i>We'll return to America News Radio

09:57.807 --> 09:59.536

10:11.588 --> 10:14.489

10:14.657 --> 10:17.990

10:19.796 --> 10:24.096
<i>OnStar operator Tina. Good morning,
Ms. Marsh. How can I assist you?</i>

10:24.267 --> 10:26.167
Yes, Tina.

10:26.569 --> 10:30.027
I'd like to get home
sometime before Easter.

10:30.206 --> 10:32.037
I'm in a traffic jam here.

10:32.208 --> 10:34.233
<i>Okay, let's see.</i>

10:34.411 --> 10:37.346

10:49.592 --> 10:52.322
Come on, keep it moving.

11:25.528 --> 11:28.622
- Shit, you scared me.
- Watch your mouth, young lady.

11:29.132 --> 11:33.228
Hey, that's what I said to you
when you were a kid.

11:33.403 --> 11:36.600
I know, Mom. That's what
makes it so darn funny.

11:36.773 --> 11:38.502
Oh, somebody's crabby.

11:38.675 --> 11:41.542
Sorry. Long night.

11:57.093 --> 11:58.993
Mom!

11:59.162 --> 12:01.824
- Look at the outfit I'm making.
- I can see that.

12:01.998 --> 12:04.831
- You're stealing my job.
- You were late.

12:05.001 --> 12:08.334
I know. I'm sorry about that, sweetie.

12:09.272 --> 12:10.500
Catch any bad guys?

12:11.875 --> 12:14.639
One. Just one.

12:20.183 --> 12:21.343
Okay, I'm coming.

12:21.518 --> 12:25.648
Slowpoke. The slowest poke
I've ever seen, ever.

12:26.456 --> 12:28.321
I'm coming.

12:31.060 --> 12:33.585
- How are things with you and Maddy?
- Better.

12:33.763 --> 12:36.357
Mrs. Tischler's gonna
give us a second chance.

12:36.533 --> 12:39.969
- A second chance at what?
- Being friends.

12:40.136 --> 12:42.900
Oh, of course. I think that's great.

12:43.239 --> 12:46.572
She can come to my party now.
Make sure to send her mom an Evite.

12:46.743 --> 12:48.711
- You got it.
- Maybe Grandma should do it.

12:48.878 --> 12:50.072
- I'll do it.
- Are you sure?

12:50.246 --> 12:53.374
When I say I'll do it, I'll do it,
okay? I promise.

12:53.550 --> 12:55.711
- I love you.
- I love you, too, babe.

13:03.960 --> 13:07.452
I bet you'd like me
to do this some other time!

13:34.157 --> 13:36.182
Hey, friendly.

14:28.211 --> 14:31.339
All right, Jennifer. Let's see
this tortured kitty of yours.

14:31.514 --> 14:33.448
Torture's over, sir.

14:34.117 --> 14:37.575
- Yeah, I should say so.
- Poor Lulu.

14:37.754 --> 14:39.187
That was the cat's name.

14:39.922 --> 14:42.789
The owner, Scotty Hillman,
26, from West Linn...

14:42.959 --> 14:47.055
...says she was snatched a few days
ago from his lawn during a yard sale.

14:47.230 --> 14:49.164
He recognized her fancy collar.

14:49.332 --> 14:50.924
West Linn. So this site...

14:51.100 --> 14:54.001
...which could have originated
anywhere from Oslo to Istanbul...

14:54.170 --> 14:55.762
Is local. Yes, sir.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.565
The odds of that are pretty steep.

14:57.740 --> 15:00.971
About a million to one, if it were
a coincidence, which it's not.

15:01.144 --> 15:04.272
The only way we found out about this
is because it was tipped...

15:04.447 --> 15:08.474
...to the county sheriff's office and the
police within minutes of it going up.

15:08.651 --> 15:11.620
Both tips came from a pay phone
in the central city...

15:11.788 --> 15:15.383
...so whoever is behind the site
is local and wants attention.

15:15.558 --> 15:17.526
- Shut him down.
- I just did.

15:20.763 --> 15:23.254
- There you go.
- I'll type the address in again.

15:30.640 --> 15:32.232
It's been doing that all night.

15:32.408 --> 15:36.344
The site's IP changes constantly. Each
new address is an exploited server...

15:36.512 --> 15:38.377
...that's running a mirror of the site.

15:38.781 --> 15:41.443
The site's Russian name server
uses a low TTL...

15:41.617 --> 15:44.643
...so your computer constantly queries
the name server's record.

15:44.821 --> 15:47.153
That's how it gives
you a new address consistently.

15:47.323 --> 15:50.019
There are thousands of exploited
servers on the Internet...

15:50.193 --> 15:52.252
...so he won't run out of victims soon.

15:52.428 --> 15:54.396
He's accessing these machines
so quickly...

15:54.564 --> 15:56.794
...he's got to be
running his own botnet.

15:56.966 --> 15:58.456
We are blackholing these IPs...

15:58.634 --> 16:01.728
...but every time we shut one down,
a new mirror pops up.

16:01.904 --> 16:04.304
I don't understand a single word
you just said.

16:04.474 --> 16:06.237
What does Russia
have to do with this?

16:06.409 --> 16:09.572
The domain registrar
and name servers are all in Russia.

16:09.746 --> 16:11.737
We have no jurisdiction there.

16:12.381 --> 16:14.246
Jennifer...

16:14.417 --> 16:16.180
...it's a cat.
- Yeah.

16:16.352 --> 16:19.719
Considering the state of the world,
aren't there more important things...

16:19.889 --> 16:23.347
...to be concerned about, like
something under our jurisdiction?

16:25.928 --> 16:28.055
Back to work, gentlemen.

16:38.474 --> 16:42.069
<i>Things are about to get warmer when
one of the hottest hockey rivalries...</i>

17:17.380 --> 17:20.508
Are you the guy? You got the
extra ticket for the hockey game?

17:42.338 --> 17:46.274
Grandma! Grandma! Grandma!

17:46.442 --> 17:47.966
- Did you get it?
- Yes, I did!

17:48.144 --> 17:50.169
Oh, my God, I'm so proud of you!

17:50.346 --> 17:53.247
And the boy I fought was so tall too.

17:53.416 --> 17:56.681
- Careful, I'm all wet.
- So am I.

17:56.853 --> 18:00.084
We celebrated. We had an ice cream.

18:00.556 --> 18:02.183
Hello.

18:40.296 --> 18:41.354
Mom?

18:41.530 --> 18:43.828
- Honey... Mom, please!
- Okay, okay.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.264
Come on, baby.
Let's get you out of these clothes.

18:50.940 --> 18:54.637
I've been monitoring the site all week.
Nothing but a still of the dead kitten.

18:54.810 --> 18:57.802
Last night around 11, the site
went down, I'd hoped forever.

18:57.980 --> 19:02.508
Anyway, a few minutes ago, this.

19:04.287 --> 19:06.847
It's the same basement
still streaming live.

19:07.023 --> 19:11.050
The top is the number of active viewers
and some chemical-dosage flow.

19:11.227 --> 19:13.923
He's carved the name of the website
into the guy's chest.

19:14.096 --> 19:15.688
He's threatening to drain him.

19:15.865 --> 19:18.925
Threatening to drain what, his blood?
How's he gonna do that?

19:19.101 --> 19:21.797
Those letters aren't any deeper
than paper cuts.

19:21.971 --> 19:23.438
Not the cuts, it's the bleeding.

19:23.606 --> 19:26.598
We think that box regulates
the fluid going into the victim.

19:26.776 --> 19:29.609
Those cables are probably
connected to our guy's computer.

19:29.779 --> 19:32.475
Look, his nose is starting
to bleed and he's bruising.

19:32.648 --> 19:35.173
We think those bags have
some anticoagulant in them.

19:35.351 --> 19:38.548
I've got a list of them right here.
The most common is heparin.

19:38.721 --> 19:42.885
If you get the dose right, you save a
life. Wrong, you've got a hemophiliac.

19:43.826 --> 19:47.193
So the more people who visit the site,
the more the drug is released...

19:47.363 --> 19:48.660
...and the faster he bleeds.

19:48.831 --> 19:51.356
- That's what we believe.
- Well, isn't that wonderful?

19:51.534 --> 19:55.061
Well, if that counter is accurate,
the public would seem to agree.

19:55.237 --> 19:57.171
They're tuning in at an alarming rate.

19:57.340 --> 19:59.638
The victim's name
is Herbert Miller, 54.

19:59.809 --> 20:03.176
Lives in Sellwood, works
for Burnside Executive Charter.

20:03.346 --> 20:07.282
Friday night, got back from a shuttle
to Mount Hood, called his wife...

20:07.450 --> 20:10.715
...says that he gets an e-mail
from a friend of a friend...

20:10.886 --> 20:13.753
...offering center-ice seats
to the Winter Hawks game.

20:13.923 --> 20:15.948
He promises
he'll be home afterwards.

20:16.125 --> 20:17.990
- He wasn't.
- Any priors?

20:19.161 --> 20:21.686
- Who, Miller?
- Why is that relevant?

20:21.864 --> 20:24.594
Remember that snuff film
sent to the L.A. office last year?

20:24.767 --> 20:27.634
Teenage geisha cut in two.
Looked as real as anything you saw.

20:27.803 --> 20:31.671
Six weeks later, they found her alive
and well, waiting tables in Little Tokyo.

20:31.841 --> 20:34.708
Maybe Miller's involved somehow.
Maybe there's a connection.

20:46.756 --> 20:49.589
What are you doing to me?

21:15.151 --> 21:16.243
Mrs. Miller!

21:20.456 --> 21:22.151
Just go away. Just leave.

21:22.324 --> 21:25.191
- Okay, folks, one side, please.
- I don't know.

21:25.361 --> 21:28.125
Come on. Police.
Coming through. Mrs. Miller.

21:28.664 --> 21:30.655
Back off. Back off. Mrs. Miller.

21:30.833 --> 21:33.461
- Portland Police. May we come in?
- Thank God you're here.

21:33.636 --> 21:35.797
I need you to back off right now.

21:37.540 --> 21:41.374
My name is Detective Box.
This is my partner, Detective Moy.

21:41.544 --> 21:45.480
Listen, is there someplace
else we can talk?

21:46.482 --> 21:47.813
Yeah, let's go outside.

21:55.191 --> 21:57.955
Oh, shit. Fuck!

21:59.195 --> 22:02.096
<i>So, Mrs. Miller, when was the
last time you saw your husband?</i>

22:02.998 --> 22:04.488
Yesterday morning.

22:04.667 --> 22:10.128
He called, and he said he'd got tickets
to the Winter Hawks game last night.

22:10.306 --> 22:14.174
He likes hockey, and I just wanted
him to come straight home.

22:14.343 --> 22:16.504
Okay. Listen...

22:16.679 --> 22:20.240
...I understand what you're going
through is very difficult. All right?

22:20.416 --> 22:24.250
But you're making it worse by talking
to the press. Don't talk to the press.

22:24.420 --> 22:25.648
Do you understand? Listen.

22:25.821 --> 22:29.518
Don't talk to the press
and stay off the computer. Okay?

22:51.514 --> 22:54.574
Listen to this. I'm running the logs
from that mirror we took down.

22:54.750 --> 22:58.982
He's blocking all the foreign IPs. Only
Americans can gain access to the site.

22:59.155 --> 23:01.146
How patriotic.

23:01.757 --> 23:04.954
We've scanned every newsgroup,
chat room, blog, website and forum...

23:05.127 --> 23:08.722
...referencing "Kill With Me,"
and I think we found our first post.

23:08.898 --> 23:12.527
It appeared just before the site went
up, then it was spammed Web-wide.

23:12.701 --> 23:15.261
"A cat caught in a rattrap.
How's that for irony?

23:15.437 --> 23:18.497
It's streaming live on killwithme.com.
It's awesome. Check it out."

23:18.674 --> 23:21.507
It was posted by a sophomore
named Andrew Kilburn.

23:21.677 --> 23:25.704
It came from his account, but it didn't
actually originate from his computer.

23:25.881 --> 23:28.816
So our guy hacked his account
and used it to start the thread.

23:28.984 --> 23:31.179
- Yeah.
- Let's go after the originating IP.

23:35.090 --> 23:37.115
Oh, God.

23:37.293 --> 23:39.158
It's too bad this guy wasn't
a Boy Scout.

23:39.328 --> 23:41.853
He could just blink Morse code
and tell us where he is.

23:55.711 --> 23:59.875
Okay, I've got the "who is."
It comes back Blue Sky ISP.

24:00.049 --> 24:04.042
- Username and password, please.
- Coming to you now.

24:07.122 --> 24:09.818
- "Chang's Restaurant"?
- He hacked into their site?

24:09.992 --> 24:12.790
No. No. Half the office eats there.

24:12.962 --> 24:15.931
He's messing with us.
He wanted us to find this.

24:16.098 --> 24:18.225
Who the hell is this guy?

24:25.207 --> 24:27.698
Jennifer Marsh, Detective Eric Box.

24:27.876 --> 24:30.071
Portland Police has him
on the Miller abduction.

24:30.246 --> 24:33.613
- Jennifer's our case agent on this.
- Case agent, sir?

24:33.782 --> 24:35.647
- You caught it, you got it.
- Please.

24:35.818 --> 24:38.753
Sir, anyone else. You know I'm
on nights because of my daughter.

24:38.921 --> 24:40.855
I understand that, but you're it.

24:42.157 --> 24:43.988
- We forming a task force?
- Not yet.

24:44.159 --> 24:45.990
Not yet?
How much more do you need?

24:46.161 --> 24:49.824
So far we have one dead cat and a man
who may or may not be in danger...

24:49.999 --> 24:53.298
That's today. You think this is it?
It's just the beginning.

24:53.869 --> 24:55.359
Marsh, hold it.

24:55.537 --> 24:58.267
You share what you've got,
and then you take it from there.

24:58.440 --> 25:01.102
Appreciate your coming in, detective.

25:04.113 --> 25:06.377
All right. You first.

25:06.782 --> 25:09.683
Well, we found Miller's car
in the Rose Garden parking lot.

25:09.852 --> 25:11.786
No prints but his own.

25:11.954 --> 25:14.855
We passed out photos of the
basement to some local contractors.

25:15.024 --> 25:18.516
They say, judging from the timbers,
the house was built in the '20s or '30s.

25:18.694 --> 25:21.857
Which narrows it down to,
you know, half the city.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.024
Yeah, what else?

25:26.201 --> 25:28.931
Miller appears to be a decent guy.
He's a Vietnam vet...

25:29.104 --> 25:32.096
...coaches his daughter's soccer,
they go to church every Sunday.

25:32.274 --> 25:34.401
So why'd the subject pick him?

25:35.277 --> 25:36.869
"Subject"?

25:37.780 --> 25:39.213
Are we in science class?

25:39.982 --> 25:42.678
- What would you prefer?
- How about "piece of shit"?

25:44.286 --> 25:45.776
Why Miller?

25:46.422 --> 25:48.686
I don't know. Maybe it was random.

25:48.857 --> 25:50.688
What about the kitten?
Talk to that guy?

25:50.859 --> 25:53.089
Scotty Hillman, yeah.
He's a fucking jackass.

25:53.262 --> 25:55.662
All he cares about is getting
the kitten's collar...

25:55.831 --> 25:58.766
...because he paid 12 bucks
for it on bidityours.com

25:58.934 --> 26:01.767
Which I suppose is a lot of money
if you're flipping burgers.

26:01.937 --> 26:05.395
What I would like to know is,
why him? Why his kitten?

26:05.574 --> 26:08.941
Why take the risk of stealing when
you can get one free at any shelter?

26:09.445 --> 26:12.175
- What do you guys got?
- It's a website.

26:12.348 --> 26:15.442
It's like nothing we've ever seen.
It's extremely sophisticated.

26:15.617 --> 26:18.711
As long as its source-streaming site
is a ghost, it's untraceable.

26:19.655 --> 26:22.715
This guy can invite the world to help
him kill Miller or anybody...

26:22.891 --> 26:25.724
...and there's not a goddamn thing
we can do about it.

26:30.366 --> 26:31.958
Excuse me.

26:41.377 --> 26:44.710
- It's over.
- Yeah.

26:45.280 --> 26:49.114
The numbers, they just... exploded.

26:55.457 --> 26:58.153
"Rolling on the floor laughing.

26:58.327 --> 26:59.487
Thank you for..."

27:00.362 --> 27:02.796
"For all your support.

27:02.965 --> 27:04.227
More to come."

27:06.468 --> 27:08.629
Well, we'll see about that.

27:12.608 --> 27:14.838
It's a jungle in there.

27:44.006 --> 27:48.238
<i>Hey, I just went to the site
after the guy was dead...</i>

27:48.410 --> 27:51.868
<i>I got a list of assholes my girlfriends
and me think he ought to kill next.</i>

27:52.047 --> 27:58.179
<i>Last seen five days ago, FBI agents
have been working around the clock...</i>

28:07.930 --> 28:09.591
There's a pickup truck.

28:09.765 --> 28:11.733
What's that on the back, a gun rack?

28:12.067 --> 28:15.901
Yeah, well, there's no way that freak is
stepping foot in my dad's country club.

28:16.071 --> 28:17.902
So call Tucker.

28:32.154 --> 28:34.987
<i>- at 7: 15 a.m., a vehicle at the home...</i>

28:35.157 --> 28:37.887
<i>... of Oregon congressman
Joseph A. Restom.</i>

28:38.060 --> 28:41.029
<i>Herbert Miller had been the focus
of an intense local...</i>

28:41.196 --> 28:43.187
<i>... and statewide police
and FBI search...</i>

28:43.365 --> 28:45.731
<i>... since midday Saturday
when he showed up...</i>

28:45.901 --> 28:49.667
...on an Internet website
being tortured and murdered live.

28:49.838 --> 28:53.501
Now, because of the uniqueness
of the crime, and because the FBI...

28:53.675 --> 28:57.509
...is able to provide resources
critical to this investigation...

28:58.146 --> 29:02.276
...they will be leading the interagency
task force assigned to the case.

29:03.252 --> 29:07.382
He flew helicopters for a living. What's
his connection to a U.S. congressman?

29:07.556 --> 29:11.287
Our guy had to dump the body.
Why not on a national stage?

29:11.460 --> 29:14.759
You think he did it to get a press
conference? Build up his fan base?

29:14.930 --> 29:16.921
Don't call them fans.
They're accomplices.

29:17.099 --> 29:20.000
All right, whatever.
Why'd he choose Restom?

29:20.168 --> 29:21.499
He's owned by Silicon Valley.

29:21.670 --> 29:24.605
He sits on the House Judiciary
Committee on Net neutrality.

29:24.773 --> 29:27.606
No restriction on content,
all traffic treated equally.

29:27.776 --> 29:30.574
- Wouldn't our guy be for that?
- You'd think so.

29:30.746 --> 29:32.714
Miller's clients
were corporate executives.

29:32.881 --> 29:34.348
Maybe some were from high-tech.

29:34.516 --> 29:36.507
I'll track down a customer list.

29:36.685 --> 29:39.620
- What about the neighbors?
- One saw a van drive by at 4 a.m.

29:39.788 --> 29:41.881
Another heard a car door slam
a minute later.

29:42.057 --> 29:44.048
Figured it was the paper
being delivered.

29:44.226 --> 29:46.353
Excuse me a second.
Might have something here.

29:46.528 --> 29:48.928
- What is it?
- Tip just came in through a hot line.

29:49.097 --> 29:53.500
Guy named Arthur James Elmer, an
engineer at Chadwick Technologies.

29:53.669 --> 29:55.796
He was fired six months ago...

29:55.971 --> 29:58.439
...for installing a wireless Webcam
in the men's room.

29:58.607 --> 30:01.940
Nice. Anyway, he's been talking
about killwithme.com nonstop...

30:02.110 --> 30:04.374
...ever since the kitty died.
Wanna ride with us?

30:04.546 --> 30:06.446
Let me check this guy out
on my end.

30:06.615 --> 30:08.742
- We'll catch up later.
- Yeah.

30:37.546 --> 30:40.879
- So, what's going on?
- He won't let us in. Kind of shy.

30:48.423 --> 30:49.981
Elmer.

30:52.494 --> 30:55.986
Look, if you didn't do anything,
you got nothing to lose letting us in.

30:56.965 --> 31:00.457
And if you did, we can always
come back with a warrant.

31:03.271 --> 31:05.398
So how do you wanna play it?

31:13.682 --> 31:15.206
Hi.

31:16.184 --> 31:17.776
I'm Detective Box.

31:17.953 --> 31:20.183
Unusual name.

31:21.556 --> 31:23.717
Well, it wasn't up to me.

31:26.028 --> 31:29.623
So you really think I killed that guy?

31:31.233 --> 31:33.133
I don't know. Did you?

31:34.136 --> 31:35.467
Well, I'm flattered.

31:35.637 --> 31:38.800
I found it highly entertaining,
especially at the end.

31:38.974 --> 31:41.033
The way viewership
increased exponentially...

31:41.209 --> 31:44.372
...like some sort of epidemic.

31:45.380 --> 31:47.211
Can I see the basement?

32:29.624 --> 32:31.387
You like movies, huh?

32:32.327 --> 32:33.817
Yeah, who doesn't?

32:35.130 --> 32:36.597
Me.

32:39.134 --> 32:40.897
Burn your own copies?

32:41.069 --> 32:42.593
You know that's illegal, right?

32:53.949 --> 32:56.179
Can't say they didn't warn you.

33:11.433 --> 33:14.027
Got our proof it wasn't Elmer.

33:14.836 --> 33:16.531
Starting Friday at 1 p. m...

33:16.872 --> 33:20.899
...Elmer was logged into a chat
room for 12 consecutive hours.

33:21.076 --> 33:24.944
At the time Miller disappeared,
Elmer was in a steamy private chat...

33:25.113 --> 33:28.913
...with the first tenor of the
Men's Chorus of Greater Tacoma.

33:29.084 --> 33:31.211
It still felt good arresting him.

33:53.809 --> 33:55.709
<i>- Hello?
- I caught you.</i>

33:56.378 --> 34:00.280
<i>- Barely. I've got a big date tonight.
- Big, special or big, large?</i>

34:00.448 --> 34:04.441
I don't know. I haven't met Peggy
the secretary yet. What's up?

34:04.619 --> 34:08.453
<i>I had a thought. Remember that
Andrew Kilburn guy and his review?</i>

34:08.623 --> 34:10.386
Yeah, sure. What about it?

34:10.659 --> 34:13.184
Well, why use his account?

34:13.360 --> 34:17.092
I mean, maybe it wasn't random.
Maybe they know each other.

34:17.565 --> 34:19.795
<i>- Yeah, it's possible.
- Yeah.</i>

34:19.967 --> 34:23.096
<i>- All right. I'll see you Sunday.
- Wait, Sunday?</i>

34:24.472 --> 34:25.598
Annie's birthday.

34:26.274 --> 34:29.300
Oh, shit, I forgot.

34:29.476 --> 34:31.842
<i>- Okay, can I bring a date?
- Are you kidding?</i>

34:32.112 --> 34:34.138
You don't even know
if you like this girl.

34:34.315 --> 34:37.774
No, not Peggy. Melanie.
She's a social worker.

34:37.953 --> 34:40.513
She likes sushi and rock-climbing
and Dickens.

34:40.688 --> 34:44.318
<i>- I can't believe you.
- It's a numbers game.</i>

34:44.492 --> 34:47.120
<i>Fine, fine. I gotta go.</i>

34:47.295 --> 34:49.695
Okay. Hey, you got a date?

34:49.864 --> 34:53.858
<i>- Good night.
- Okay. Bye. Good night, Sam.</i>

35:07.916 --> 35:09.781
Molly gave me
a birthday present already.

35:09.951 --> 35:11.851
It's a computer game
that I downloaded.

35:12.020 --> 35:15.046
- It's about horses.
- How sweet of her. That looks like fun.

35:16.057 --> 35:18.048
Not really. It's kind of silly.

35:19.060 --> 35:23.394
- I'll show it to you later.
- Okay, honey. I love you. Gotta run.

35:54.663 --> 35:57.632
Come on, Annie. Let me get one first.

35:59.834 --> 36:01.529
Somebody order a bunch of pizzas?

36:01.703 --> 36:03.068
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

36:03.238 --> 36:05.297
- Hey, Griffin.
- For the birthday girl. Hello.

36:05.473 --> 36:08.306
- How are you? Over here?
- Over here.

36:11.046 --> 36:14.277
Listen, I only made it through
a few months of Kilburn's posts.

36:14.449 --> 36:16.246
- We'll need more bodies on this.
- Okay.

36:16.418 --> 36:21.185
He blogged, he uploaded vids, he
built sites. He practically lived online.

36:21.356 --> 36:24.348
- What, not anymore?
- Not since he died...

36:24.526 --> 36:27.893
...of something called
diabetic ketoacidosis.

36:28.063 --> 36:31.396
Which is what happens when you
don't take your insulin for a few days.

36:31.566 --> 36:34.467
Anyway, an hour after his body
was found...

36:34.636 --> 36:35.796
...Kill With Me went up.

36:35.971 --> 36:38.940
And an hour after that, Kilburn's
review was spammed Web-wide.

36:39.107 --> 36:42.975
- And you think our guy killed him?
- The ME called it a suicide.

37:08.370 --> 37:09.598
Hi.

37:09.771 --> 37:11.432
You're right on time.

37:11.606 --> 37:15.201
Yeah, well, it's a curse.
I spend half my life waiting for people.

37:15.377 --> 37:18.505
So... Dave Williams.

37:21.282 --> 37:25.719
That's a great address, by the way.
Eights bring prosperity.

37:25.887 --> 37:28.788
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

37:29.624 --> 37:31.717
- Come in.
- Thanks.

37:47.642 --> 37:48.666
Here you go, honey.

37:48.843 --> 37:50.902
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

37:55.650 --> 37:56.776
Detective.

37:56.951 --> 37:59.078
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:59.254 --> 38:02.587
Griffin invited me
to his birthday party.

38:04.159 --> 38:06.320
Yeah. Kind of a young crowd.

38:06.494 --> 38:08.553
Kind of a young crowd, Griffin.

38:08.730 --> 38:11.563
- Well, do you skate?
- No.

38:11.733 --> 38:13.758
- Thank you.
- Yeah, go ahead.

38:13.935 --> 38:16.768
Look, I'm gonna get out of here.
I'm sorry.

38:16.938 --> 38:20.772
You just got here. Don't go.
Have some pizza.

38:20.942 --> 38:23.911
Come on. It's not that bad.

38:33.588 --> 38:36.751
Wow, you must really like Asia, huh?

38:38.760 --> 38:40.591
Just Korea.

38:42.964 --> 38:44.693
Korea.

38:45.166 --> 38:47.157
Well, it's fabulous.

38:48.369 --> 38:49.927
Thank you.

38:52.740 --> 38:54.674
So you gonna let me see them?

38:55.243 --> 38:56.938
Of course.

38:57.879 --> 38:59.346
Through the kitchen.

39:02.517 --> 39:06.749
I gotta tell you, a 710 Pullman
and a 712 Observation Car?

39:06.921 --> 39:09.048
My heart skipped a beat
when I got your e-mail.

39:09.224 --> 39:13.388
- If they're really in mint condition...
- My dad and I hardly ever used them.

39:13.928 --> 39:18.126
We mostly played foosball
and we built things.

39:19.567 --> 39:22.536
Toys, contraptions.

39:23.104 --> 39:25.129
We had a workshop.

39:25.807 --> 39:27.741
He died last year.

39:30.478 --> 39:33.504
Well, I'm sorry.

39:47.562 --> 39:50.791
Annie, would you come over here
for a second? Bring your skates.

39:50.965 --> 39:54.059
- Okay.
- I want you to meet someone.

39:56.504 --> 39:59.564
This is Annie, the birthday girl.
This is my friend, Eric.

39:59.741 --> 40:01.538
- Hello, Annie.
- Hi.

40:01.709 --> 40:03.540
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

40:04.012 --> 40:05.912
You must be, what, 8?

40:06.414 --> 40:08.905
How did you know?
Everyone else thinks I'm older.

40:10.218 --> 40:11.685
Well, I'm a detective.

40:13.621 --> 40:16.021
- Are you ready to go skating finally?
- I think.

40:32.640 --> 40:34.665
I sure hope you like it.

40:34.842 --> 40:36.469
It's a punching bag.

40:36.644 --> 40:37.872
Okay, so you blow it up...

40:38.046 --> 40:40.276
...and whenever you
get in a really bad mood...

40:40.448 --> 40:42.006
...you sock it in the head.

40:43.351 --> 40:44.375
Can I do karate on it?

40:44.552 --> 40:48.716
Of course you can. You can do karate,
kung fu, tae kwon do.

40:48.890 --> 40:51.916
- Thank you, Griffin.
- You're welcome, sweetie.

40:52.093 --> 40:53.424
That might be my date.

40:55.630 --> 40:57.188
Mom.

40:59.300 --> 41:01.325
Oh, come on.

41:01.936 --> 41:03.164
Happy birthday, sweetie.

41:03.338 --> 41:04.498
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

41:06.541 --> 41:08.441
Sweetheart...

41:08.943 --> 41:09.932
...I gotta go.

41:10.144 --> 41:12.977
It's a real emergency, or I
would never leave you like this.

41:13.147 --> 41:16.116
- I'll make it up to you, I promise. Okay?
- Okay.

41:18.820 --> 41:20.845
I'm looking for Griffin Dowd. He's...

41:21.022 --> 41:22.011
- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi.

41:22.190 --> 41:23.987
- I'm Melanie.
- Oh, yes. Hi, Melanie.

41:24.158 --> 41:27.286
Wow, you are gorgeous.
I'm sorry. I've gotta run.

41:58.226 --> 41:59.784
Todd!

42:00.561 --> 42:02.654
Isn't that your dad?

42:11.005 --> 42:14.168
- Same build, same coloring.
- The counter's faster than last time.

42:14.876 --> 42:16.468
Yeah.

42:17.512 --> 42:19.503
I swear I've seen this guy
somewhere before.

42:19.681 --> 42:21.706
- Yeah.
- We all have. He's David Williams.

42:21.883 --> 42:23.908
He used to be
a reporter for Channel 12.

42:24.185 --> 42:26.346
He now hosts a TV show
on public access.

42:26.587 --> 42:28.418
Call Bagley.
Set up a press conference.

42:28.589 --> 42:31.183
Sir, wait just a minute, please.

42:31.592 --> 42:34.493
This is what he wants. Anything
you say will promote the site.

42:34.662 --> 42:36.892
That's a possibility,
but what would you prefer?

42:37.065 --> 42:38.657
Talk to National Security Agency.

42:38.833 --> 42:41.631
Their computer capability's
beyond ours. We need their help.

42:41.803 --> 42:44.397
That's fine, but I've got
a man being publicly tortured.

42:44.572 --> 42:48.008
How will it look if he dies and the
Bureau never tried to help the guy?

42:48.176 --> 42:51.942
Not as bad as if we reach out
and it kills him faster.

42:52.980 --> 42:55.608
You honestly believe
that could happen?

42:57.518 --> 42:59.110
Yes, sir, I do.

43:07.595 --> 43:08.892
I'm sorry, Marsh.

43:10.698 --> 43:12.427
I got no choice.

43:40.094 --> 43:42.358
<i>We're gathered here
to share some information...</i>

43:42.530 --> 43:44.225
<i>... in regards to criminal conduct...</i>

43:44.399 --> 43:47.163
<i>... that originated in the
Portland metropolitan area...</i>

43:47.335 --> 43:50.429
<i>... but that has
far-reaching implications.</i>

43:50.605 --> 43:52.573
<i>Let me introduce
Special Agent-in-Charge...</i>

43:52.740 --> 43:55.140
<i>... of the FBI's Portland field office...</i>

43:55.309 --> 43:57.277
...Richard Brooks.

43:58.679 --> 44:00.203
Thank you, chief.

44:01.249 --> 44:04.912
<i>A week ago, a man was killed
in this city.</i>

44:05.820 --> 44:10.587
<i>This barbaric, cowardly murder
was streamed live on the Internet.</i>

44:10.758 --> 44:14.660
<i>As part of the killer's design, the more
people who logged on to the site...</i>

44:14.829 --> 44:19.266
<i>... to witness the victim's suffering,
the sooner the victim died.</i>

44:19.434 --> 44:21.664
<i>Millions of Americans
chose to visit the site...</i>

44:21.836 --> 44:26.535
<i>... believing that they were witnessing
a mere hoax, a stunt or a prank.</i>

44:26.707 --> 44:28.299
<i>Well, unfortunately, it wasn't.</i>

44:28.476 --> 44:30.103
<i>Today a second individual...</i>

44:30.278 --> 44:33.179
<i>... has appeared on the site
and his life, too, is in jeopardy.</i>

44:33.347 --> 44:36.805
<i>The victim is the doting father
of two boys...</i>

44:38.653 --> 44:41.019
<i>... a loving husband of 22 years...</i>

44:41.189 --> 44:44.647
<i>... and a devoted son. In other words,
he's a good American, one of us.</i>

44:44.826 --> 44:48.956
<i>The torture that he is experiencing
now is unimaginable in its cruelty.</i>

44:49.730 --> 44:51.027
<i>We're doing what we can...</i>

44:51.199 --> 44:54.362
<i>... to shut down the site
and bring the killer to justice.</i>

44:54.602 --> 44:57.537
<i>In the meantime, we ask that
everyone stay away from the site.</i>

44:58.172 --> 45:00.265
Any visit to this site,
no matter how brief...

45:00.441 --> 45:02.500
...will only hasten the victim's death.

45:04.579 --> 45:08.071
Any American who visits the site
is an accomplice to murder.

45:08.249 --> 45:10.683
<i>We are the murder weapon.</i>

45:10.852 --> 45:14.618
<i>- We ask that you spread the word...
- Let's main-screen the website.</i>

45:15.890 --> 45:18.882
Hey, Tim, I think
he's trying to say something.

45:23.130 --> 45:25.394
Eight... Eight...

45:28.002 --> 45:30.436
Eight, eight, eight.

45:31.005 --> 45:33.098
Oh, I get it. It's an address, I think.

45:33.708 --> 45:37.735
Eight... Eight-oh-eight...

45:37.912 --> 45:39.573
...Newberry.
- Newberry?

45:39.747 --> 45:41.715
There's a Newberry Road
in Laurelhurst.

46:07.308 --> 46:08.332
Police! Open the door!

46:29.497 --> 46:31.294
Basement's here!

46:44.879 --> 46:45.903
It's the wrong house.

46:54.088 --> 46:56.750
<i>- Any American who visits the site...
- He was here, though.</i>

46:56.924 --> 47:00.155
<i>... is an accomplice to murder.
We are the murder weapon.</i>

47:00.328 --> 47:04.321
<i>Any American who visits the site
is an accomplice to murder.</i>

47:04.498 --> 47:07.296
<i>We are the murder weapon.
Any American...</i>

47:07.468 --> 47:10.767
All right. We should send
Forensics in here.

47:12.473 --> 47:16.204
<i>Any American who visits the site
is an accomplice to murder.</i>

47:16.377 --> 47:19.210
<i>We are the murder weapon.</i>

47:24.685 --> 47:29.713
Yeah, I understand that. Just
have her check it again, okay?

47:29.890 --> 47:33.121
- Six hours. So fast.
- Twice as fast as Miller.

47:33.394 --> 47:35.862
Nobody thinks
they did anything wrong.

47:36.564 --> 47:41.001
Why should they?
They're curious about a website.

47:41.502 --> 47:43.993
You check the headlines,
check the stock market...

47:44.171 --> 47:46.196
...watch some strangers have sex.

47:46.674 --> 47:49.234
See a journalist get his head cut off.

47:52.079 --> 47:54.809
When did the world
go so fucking insane?

47:57.418 --> 48:00.012
You've been working
the streets too long.

48:00.721 --> 48:04.851
He was definitely here.
He just got moved and didn't know it.

48:09.030 --> 48:11.692
So Mrs. Williams is checking her
husband's e-mail for us.

48:14.001 --> 48:17.596
She says he was contacted about the
trains through the public TV website.

48:18.873 --> 48:22.673
I guess in his bio, he mentions he's
a collector. That was about a week ago.

48:23.177 --> 48:24.303
Who owns the house?

48:24.478 --> 48:30.314
Tom Park, 60s, widower. He's out
of town visiting family in South Korea.

48:30.484 --> 48:33.647
He runs a local market here.
He makes the trip every year.

48:34.221 --> 48:36.519
So our guy's a customer.

48:36.857 --> 48:39.849
We're trying to get ahold of Mr. Park,
see if he knows anything.

48:40.027 --> 48:43.155
We'll do a canvass. Seems like
a pretty tight-knit community.

48:43.330 --> 48:44.922
Maybe somebody saw something.

50:00.441 --> 50:02.068
Did you see this?

50:05.146 --> 50:07.478
On the bright side, along with
every other daily...

50:07.648 --> 50:09.741
...they're not printing
the name of the site.

50:09.917 --> 50:11.851
Well, isn't that noble?

50:12.019 --> 50:13.213
A little late, though.

50:15.122 --> 50:18.319
Did Annie ever forgive you
for bailing on the party?

50:18.692 --> 50:22.560
Yeah. After 11 bedtime stories.
Thank you.

50:23.831 --> 50:27.597
You know, when we first met,
I knew you looked familiar.

50:30.504 --> 50:32.472
Nick and I came up together.

50:35.376 --> 50:38.004
Nick Haskins.
That was Annie's father, right?

50:39.079 --> 50:40.910
Did he introduce us?

50:42.082 --> 50:45.711
No. No, we never met.
I saw you at the funeral.

50:47.855 --> 50:49.482
Right.

50:54.829 --> 50:58.731
Anyway, he was a...
He was a great guy.

50:59.600 --> 51:02.228
Yeah, he was a great guy.

51:11.912 --> 51:15.109
<i>It's apparent our subject
is extremely organized...</i>

51:15.282 --> 51:17.011
...and sophisticated.

51:17.184 --> 51:19.846
And based upon his ability
to subdue his victims...

51:20.020 --> 51:22.784
...transport them and maintain
physical control over them...

51:22.957 --> 51:26.688
...in a private setting, I'd describe
the offender as highly capable.

51:26.861 --> 51:28.829
Remember, he's not going
after easy prey.

51:28.996 --> 51:31.430
These abductions leave him exposed.

51:31.599 --> 51:34.898
Even the kitten he stole
in broad daylight. Why the risks?

51:35.069 --> 51:39.836
Because each of these actions was
absolutely essential to his purpose.

51:40.007 --> 51:42.567
You wanna catch him,
understand his goals.

51:42.743 --> 51:44.734
You know, this guy...

51:44.912 --> 51:47.403
...he's the same as
the Unabomber, Tim McVeigh.

51:47.581 --> 51:49.845
He's another terrorist
trying to make a statement.

51:50.017 --> 51:53.885
Maybe. Still, it goes back to his goals.
Why kill these particular people?

51:54.221 --> 51:56.655
And why is he killing them
on the Internet?

51:56.824 --> 52:00.385
My guess, none of it's random.
None of it.

52:05.866 --> 52:11.304
Okay. Every post Kilburn ever left.
Thousands. And a couple of DVDs.

52:11.472 --> 52:15.841
One for you, one for me. Every
video clip that he ever uploaded.

52:16.010 --> 52:19.468
That was his real hobby, was
pulling the sick shit off the Net...

52:19.647 --> 52:22.912
...and then posting it
on shock-video sites.

52:23.717 --> 52:27.118
Anyways, this is the last post
before he died.

52:27.488 --> 52:29.513
It's sort of a best-of compilation...

52:29.690 --> 52:32.215
...something he called
"The Best of the Worst."

52:38.532 --> 52:39.658
Oh, yeah.

52:42.136 --> 52:44.969
Poor Kilburn. He had so much
to offer the world.

52:45.139 --> 52:46.367
Yeah.

52:46.740 --> 52:50.540
I got four more bodies from Brooks,
so let's share the pain, shall we?

52:50.711 --> 52:52.144
Great.

53:47.835 --> 53:49.666
Okay.

54:41.522 --> 54:45.253
Mom. TiVo's not working.

54:45.426 --> 54:48.554
Okay, honey.
Look, I'll be out in a minute.

55:18.392 --> 55:21.452
Mom, there's a video of our house
on the computer.

55:21.628 --> 55:24.927
Watch whatever you want, honey.
I'll be right out.

56:01.635 --> 56:04.035
Hey, Griff. Good morning.

56:18.952 --> 56:20.010
Annie.

56:29.563 --> 56:31.190
Annie!

56:33.100 --> 56:34.863
- Annie!
- Mom?

56:39.206 --> 56:42.334
Baby, what are you doing out here?
What are you doing outside?

56:42.509 --> 56:44.875
I was just gonna ride my bike
for the camera.

56:45.045 --> 56:47.138
You stay with Grandma.

56:59.293 --> 57:01.591
Hey. Hey, that's evidence.

57:01.762 --> 57:04.697
- I'm sorry. My daughter, she...
- It's okay. We're here now.

57:04.865 --> 57:07.732
It's okay.
Do you know whose car this is?

57:07.901 --> 57:10.597
Yeah, I think I have an idea
whose car this is.

57:16.510 --> 57:18.102
God.

57:55.882 --> 57:58.749
Annie thought she'd downloaded
a game from one of her friends.

57:58.919 --> 58:00.216
It had a backdoor Trojan.

58:00.387 --> 58:03.447
It got him all the way
into my wireless network.

58:03.991 --> 58:06.186
Which means that he has access
to all my files.

58:31.151 --> 58:34.086
Call me when you get there.
I love you.

58:45.999 --> 58:48.092
Why don't you just go with them?

58:49.403 --> 58:51.166
What are you waiting for?

58:53.373 --> 58:55.307
And do what? Hide out?

58:56.310 --> 58:57.902
That's right.

58:58.478 --> 59:01.504
I think you've sacrificed enough
already, don't you?

59:03.550 --> 59:05.575
Nobody's gonna blame you
for taking cover.

59:05.752 --> 59:08.243
The piece of shit's camped out
on your front lawn.

59:08.622 --> 59:11.284
Annie's already lost one parent
to the job, so...

59:11.458 --> 59:15.360
...yeah. Get lost.

59:19.032 --> 59:20.897
Just my opinion.

59:48.895 --> 59:52.262
<i>- Yeah?
- Hey, Jen. Did they get off okay?</i>

59:52.432 --> 59:56.266
<i>Yeah. The Bureau's gonna put
them up a couple hours away.</i>

59:56.436 --> 59:58.996
<i>And I'm gonna stay someplace
closer to work.</i>

59:59.172 --> 01:00:03.233
Good. So you wanna hear my theory
why he did this?

01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:04.468
Of course.

01:00:04.644 --> 01:00:07.408
<i>There is a connection
between him and Kilburn...</i>

01:00:07.581 --> 01:00:11.278
<i>... and he knows you're leading
the team to find it.</i>

01:00:11.551 --> 01:00:13.644
I think I might know what
that connection is.

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:16.220
Emphasis on "might."
A few things I gotta check out.

01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:17.948
I'm on my way in. Are you coming?

01:00:18.925 --> 01:00:20.256
I need a couple hours.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:21.891
<i>I'll see you at the office.</i>

01:00:22.062 --> 01:00:23.689
Okay, I'll show you
what I got then.

01:00:23.864 --> 01:00:25.297
Okay.

01:00:29.169 --> 01:00:32.138
<i>- Griffin Dowd.
- Hi. It's Melanie.</i>

01:00:33.974 --> 01:00:37.774
Melanie, hi. I didn't think
I'd hear from you again.

01:00:38.078 --> 01:00:40.945
<i>Your e-mail was very sweet.</i>

01:00:41.114 --> 01:00:43.912
Thank you. Yeah, I spent
a lot of time on that one.

01:00:45.886 --> 01:00:49.014
So I heard you hung out
at the roller rink.

01:00:49.189 --> 01:00:51.214
Even had some cake?

01:00:51.658 --> 01:00:54.752
<i>Two pieces. But don't tell anybody.</i>

01:00:54.928 --> 01:00:57.362
Okay, well,
your secret is safe with me.

01:00:57.531 --> 01:01:00.830
<i>Annie really liked you, and
you know what they say about kids.</i>

01:01:01.001 --> 01:01:04.493
<i>Along with dogs, they're terrific
judges of character.</i>

01:01:05.405 --> 01:01:08.465
What can I say?
I would have to agree.

01:01:09.443 --> 01:01:11.741
I'm a total catch.

01:01:19.653 --> 01:01:21.211
Hi, Ray.

01:01:36.336 --> 01:01:38.827
- Where's Griffin?
- Haven't seen him.

01:01:39.673 --> 01:01:41.504
Brooks wants to see you.

01:01:41.675 --> 01:01:43.404
- Now?
- Now.

01:02:22.282 --> 01:02:25.410
- Agent Marsh, sir.
- Yeah, send her in.

01:02:29.289 --> 01:02:31.280
You wanted to see me, sir?

01:02:31.825 --> 01:02:33.554
How are you doing?

01:02:34.027 --> 01:02:38.054
Well, it was an interesting start
of the day. We're fine.

01:02:38.932 --> 01:02:40.456
Good.

01:02:40.767 --> 01:02:43.099
I want you to know
I did follow up with the NSA.

01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:46.762
As far as using their supercomputer
goes, unfortunately the answer's no.

01:02:48.675 --> 01:02:51.508
- Why not?
- They're barred for domestic use.

01:02:51.678 --> 01:02:55.705
Domestic? We've got him using
mirrors in Russia, Malaysia...

01:02:55.882 --> 01:02:58.942
It's too public a forum. They
don't want their capabilities known.

01:02:59.119 --> 01:03:00.552
As far as what they can and...

01:03:19.372 --> 01:03:22.102
It's Griffin. It's Griffin!

01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:29.471
Where do these tubes lead?
What are those tanks?

01:03:29.649 --> 01:03:31.344
Tim! Punch in on those tanks.

01:03:34.487 --> 01:03:36.148
What's that say?

01:03:36.323 --> 01:03:37.415
"Sulfuric acid"?

01:03:38.491 --> 01:03:39.788
Sulfuric acid?

01:03:45.699 --> 01:03:47.428
If that's water in that tank...

01:03:48.034 --> 01:03:50.730
...pretty soon he's gonna be
sitting in battery acid.

01:04:26.206 --> 01:04:28.470
Don't wanna hear about
bureaus and jurisdictions.

01:04:28.642 --> 01:04:31.304
This is domestic terrorism,
plain and simple.

01:04:33.513 --> 01:04:37.074
Yeah? Well, just get it done.
Yeah. All right.

01:04:51.598 --> 01:04:55.398
You know, if no one was watching
right now, you'd just be sitting in water.

01:04:59.472 --> 01:05:03.374
But the whole world wants to watch
you die, and they don't even know you.

01:05:22.896 --> 01:05:25.228
It's so fast this time.

01:05:26.733 --> 01:05:29.099
It's word of mouth, I guess.

01:05:30.704 --> 01:05:32.865
Because I let you keep your badge on.

01:06:45.278 --> 01:06:48.304
Ray! I need your help.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:56.520
Tim, go in on his eyes.

01:07:00.894 --> 01:07:04.660
I think he's trying to say something
to us. Here.

01:07:05.331 --> 01:07:08.767
Please. Do your best. Hurry!

01:07:12.705 --> 01:07:14.798
Right eye's dots.

01:07:14.974 --> 01:07:17.534
Left is... Left is dashes.

01:07:25.451 --> 01:07:26.975
"S."

01:07:39.165 --> 01:07:40.757
"I."

01:07:45.004 --> 01:07:46.437
"D."

01:08:19.272 --> 01:08:21.296
<i>There aren't any other kids here...</i>

01:08:21.474 --> 01:08:24.466
<i>... but the swimming pool's fun
and there's satellite TV.</i>

01:08:25.144 --> 01:08:27.169
<i>Mom, are you there?</i>

01:08:29.782 --> 01:08:31.613
<i>We miss you, Mommy.
When are you coming?</i>

01:08:31.783 --> 01:08:36.118
<i>It's starting to get really boring.
Your work isn't done yet?</i>

01:08:36.756 --> 01:08:38.621
I wish.

01:08:41.261 --> 01:08:42.853
<i>Mom?</i>

01:08:43.830 --> 01:08:44.921
I have to go now, honey.

01:08:45.265 --> 01:08:47.893
Listen, you call me
as soon as you wake up. Okay, bug?

01:08:48.067 --> 01:08:51.627
<i>- It's Box.
- I will. Love you. Say hi to Griffin.</i>

01:08:51.804 --> 01:08:55.569
I love you too, honey. Bye.

01:09:20.066 --> 01:09:21.761
Dinner.

01:09:31.877 --> 01:09:34.403
I think I'll take a shower first.

01:10:05.478 --> 01:10:10.916
The acid was stolen from a research
lab at Marshall Junior College.

01:10:13.486 --> 01:10:16.819
The thief apparently knew
his way around.

01:10:20.193 --> 01:10:24.653
Looks like... Looks like Griffin
was baited with a phone call.

01:10:24.831 --> 01:10:28.699
But we can't trace it because
it was made with a spoof card.

01:10:28.868 --> 01:10:31.666
Yeah, it's a phone card.
Costs about 10 bucks an hour.

01:10:31.838 --> 01:10:34.830
Lets you program any
caller ID you want.

01:10:36.075 --> 01:10:39.909
This guy breached my laptop.
He must've owned Griffin's too.

01:10:40.079 --> 01:10:42.570
Figured out where he was vulnerable.

01:10:47.987 --> 01:10:49.716
Sorry.

01:10:53.059 --> 01:10:55.789
I'm good at a lot of things, you know?

01:10:56.763 --> 01:10:59.231
But I'm not good at losing people.

01:10:59.399 --> 01:11:02.334
I'm bad at losing people.

01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:15.869
Rush-hour suicide.

01:12:17.076 --> 01:12:21.638
I'm pretty sure that's what Griffin was
trying to say. I'm just not sure why.

01:12:24.851 --> 01:12:26.580
Yeah, I remember.

01:12:26.752 --> 01:12:29.778
He was a professor, that guy.

01:12:30.256 --> 01:12:33.714
Andrew Kilburn included this
in his greatest hits.

01:12:35.795 --> 01:12:39.856
- I was just there, like a week ago.
- Where?

01:12:40.099 --> 01:12:44.297
At the Bridge Diner. You know, the
one under the Broadway Bridge.

01:12:44.937 --> 01:12:47.599
I was talking to Scotty Hillman...

01:12:47.773 --> 01:12:50.173
...the guy who owned the cat.
That's where he works.

01:12:51.844 --> 01:12:54.210
What was this guy's name?
Do you remember?

01:12:55.681 --> 01:12:59.276
No. I think
he taught Chemistry, though.

01:13:02.188 --> 01:13:04.748
At Marshall Junior College?

01:13:12.398 --> 01:13:16.596
Andrew Kilburn, a sophomore at
Portland State. Died last month...

01:13:16.769 --> 01:13:20.330
...but that didn't stop him
from recommending, after he died...

01:13:20.506 --> 01:13:23.907
...a new website called
killwithme.com.

01:13:24.243 --> 01:13:28.304
How'd he do that? He didn't.
The killer did, using his account.

01:13:28.481 --> 01:13:31.245
When Agent Griffin Dowd's
investigation revealed why...

01:13:31.417 --> 01:13:33.510
...this deceased college student
was chosen...

01:13:33.686 --> 01:13:37.850
...to promote the Kill With Me site,
it cost him his life.

01:13:42.128 --> 01:13:44.392
This is James Reilly.

01:13:44.764 --> 01:13:45.992
Sixteen months ago...

01:13:46.165 --> 01:13:49.191
...depressed over the recent death
of his wife, a hematologist...

01:13:49.368 --> 01:13:53.600
...Reilly staggered out into rush-hour
traffic on the Broadway Bridge.

01:13:53.773 --> 01:13:55.673
Traffic copters were out in force...

01:13:55.841 --> 01:13:58.708
...but only one caught all the action
from beginning to end...

01:13:58.878 --> 01:14:00.311
...Channel 12.

01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:04.609
The regular pilot was out sick that day,
so the job went to Herbert Miller.

01:14:06.085 --> 01:14:10.988
He later told friends he'd gotten lucky.
At the right place at the right time.

01:14:15.795 --> 01:14:17.285
The back of Reilly's skull...

01:14:17.463 --> 01:14:20.990
...landed on the rooftop
of this diner. So did his glasses.

01:14:21.167 --> 01:14:23.135
The skull was turned over
to the coroner...

01:14:23.302 --> 01:14:26.794
...but the glasses were retrieved
by one of the diner's employees...

01:14:26.973 --> 01:14:28.167
...Scotty Hillman.

01:14:29.008 --> 01:14:30.908
He put them up for sale online.

01:14:31.077 --> 01:14:32.840
And they sold quickly.

01:14:33.012 --> 01:14:35.276
Kids were home from school.
Parents were outraged.

01:14:35.448 --> 01:14:38.008
They called the TV stations.
The TV stations apologized.

01:14:38.184 --> 01:14:39.583
Except for Channel 12.

01:14:39.752 --> 01:14:43.210
They'd been having a little problem
in the ratings, but not that afternoon.

01:14:43.389 --> 01:14:45.016
Their numbers were sky-high.

01:14:45.191 --> 01:14:47.716
And knowing a good thing
when it fell into their lap...

01:14:47.893 --> 01:14:50.191
...they rushed a veteran reporter
to the scene.

01:14:50.363 --> 01:14:51.557
<i>This is David Williams...</i>

01:14:51.731 --> 01:14:54.564
He got lucky, landed an interview
with a local businessman...

01:14:54.734 --> 01:14:57.794
...whose parked Cadillac had been
struck by Reilly's falling body.

01:14:57.970 --> 01:14:59.232
When the interview ended...

01:14:59.405 --> 01:15:02.397
...Channel 12, as a courtesy to
those who might have missed it...

01:15:02.575 --> 01:15:04.941
...aired the entire video one last time.

01:15:05.111 --> 01:15:07.875
Within minutes, Andrew Kilburn
had pulled it off his TiVo...

01:15:08.047 --> 01:15:11.175
...and posted it on five different
shock-video sites.

01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:14.478
From there, Reilly's suicide
was public domain.

01:15:14.654 --> 01:15:19.785
Something for five billion people
to feed on, laugh at, gossip about.

01:15:19.959 --> 01:15:21.893
Reilly had a son, Owen.

01:15:23.029 --> 01:15:26.396
He was brilliant. Good at electronics,
mechanics and computers...

01:15:26.565 --> 01:15:29.898
<i>... but he was disturbed.
He was troubled. He was withdrawn.</i>

01:15:30.536 --> 01:15:32.868
Owen took his father's suicide
very hard.

01:15:33.039 --> 01:15:36.805
He had to be hospitalized.
And six months ago he was released.

01:15:37.576 --> 01:15:40.443
This x-ray image is supposed to be
Owen's father.

01:15:40.613 --> 01:15:43.309
The number on the left,
the date his father died...

01:15:44.317 --> 01:15:47.582
...followed by the number
of his autopsy report.

01:15:47.987 --> 01:15:50.888
<i>Owen lives alone now
at his father's house in Fairview.</i>

01:15:51.057 --> 01:15:53.321
What do you say we arrest
the piece of shit?

01:15:55.156 --> 01:15:56.817
Go! Go!

01:16:32.427 --> 01:16:33.689
Basement's clear!

01:16:48.743 --> 01:16:50.540
This is bad.

01:17:24.112 --> 01:17:27.172
<i>There are new developments
in the Internet murder investigation...</i>

01:17:27.348 --> 01:17:30.840
<i>... tonight out of Portland, Oregon.
For more, let's turn to Marilyn Deutsch.</i>

01:17:31.018 --> 01:17:33.748
<i>Right. Police now say they know
who is kidnapping people...</i>

01:17:33.921 --> 01:17:36.856
<i>... in this area and then killing them
live on the Web.</i>

01:17:37.225 --> 01:17:40.991
<i>Take a look at this picture. Police say
the suspect's name is Owen Reilly.</i>

01:17:41.162 --> 01:17:44.928
<i>He is 20 years old,
and just nine months ago...</i>

01:17:45.666 --> 01:17:47.258
First...

01:17:47.435 --> 01:17:50.962
...I just wanted to say how sorry I am.

01:17:51.539 --> 01:17:54.337
This was a loss for all of us...

01:17:54.509 --> 01:17:57.706
...but most deeply for you,
and we know that. I know that.

01:17:59.814 --> 01:18:04.376
You've done everything you
possibly could. You've given enough.

01:18:05.586 --> 01:18:09.215
- I want you to take some time off.
- What?

01:18:09.724 --> 01:18:12.818
Why? Because now it's personal?

01:18:12.994 --> 01:18:15.258
This guy's still running around,
the case is open.

01:18:15.429 --> 01:18:16.794
The kid's face is everywhere.

01:18:16.964 --> 01:18:20.331
He's driving around in a 40-year-old
VW bus with electronics in it.

01:18:20.501 --> 01:18:22.162
We'll have him
by this time tomorrow.

01:18:22.336 --> 01:18:25.703
- Maybe.
- Jennifer, I'm not only thinking of you.

01:18:27.141 --> 01:18:30.440
Now join your family. Just for a week.

01:18:32.814 --> 01:18:34.941
I'll take a day.

01:19:25.199 --> 01:19:27.565
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:19:28.102 --> 01:19:31.128
So, what'd he say?

01:19:31.906 --> 01:19:33.999
He told me to get lost.

01:19:35.676 --> 01:19:37.041
Well, he's right.

01:19:39.914 --> 01:19:42.041
And what did you say?

01:19:47.989 --> 01:19:49.820
That's what I figured.

01:21:42.269 --> 01:21:44.931
<i>This has been America News Radio.</i>

01:21:45.106 --> 01:21:48.598
<i>Now back to your local
ANR station for news.</i>

01:21:49.243 --> 01:21:51.939
<i>Good evening.
You're listening to KMZR, Portland.</i>

01:21:52.113 --> 01:21:55.082
<i>This is the news at the top
of the 10:00 hour.</i>

01:21:55.249 --> 01:21:57.877
<i>Dominating the news again here
and across the nation...</i>

01:21:58.052 --> 01:22:01.078
<i>... is the increasingly urgent search
for the Internet killer...</i>

01:22:01.255 --> 01:22:04.349
<i>... now known to be
Owen Reilly of Portland.</i>

01:22:04.525 --> 01:22:08.621
<i>His most recent victim, an FBI
cyber-crimes agent, Griffin Dowd...</i>

01:22:08.796 --> 01:22:12.288
<i>... was discovered dead in Reilly's
Fairview home basement this morning.</i>

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.333
<i>In what the FBI is describing as
the most serious Internet crime wave...</i>

01:22:16.504 --> 01:22:19.029
<i>... since the computer age began...</i>

01:23:05.319 --> 01:23:06.308
Shit!

01:23:08.722 --> 01:23:10.451
<i>Hello, Jennifer.</i>

01:23:16.063 --> 01:23:17.928
<i>Look out the front window.</i>

01:23:18.732 --> 01:23:20.996
<i>Under that streetlight.</i>

01:23:22.336 --> 01:23:25.464
<i>That's where my father's body
fell over the railing.</i>

01:23:25.639 --> 01:23:28.039
<i>Some websites show the whole
thing in slow motion...</i>

01:23:28.209 --> 01:23:31.440
<i>... because it's just so much
better that way.</i>

01:23:33.247 --> 01:23:36.307
<i>One archives it in a section
called "whoa."</i>

01:23:37.017 --> 01:23:40.509
<i>That's it. Just "whoa."</i>

01:23:41.822 --> 01:23:43.949
<i>You and the people you work with...</i>

01:23:44.992 --> 01:23:48.120
<i>... you let people say and do
almost anything they want.</i>

01:23:48.295 --> 01:23:50.456
<i>It doesn't matter who it hurts.</i>

01:23:53.934 --> 01:23:56.061
I'm sorry, Owen.

01:23:59.773 --> 01:24:01.764
Owen, are you there?

01:24:37.211 --> 01:24:38.838
<i>- Call Answering Center.
- Listen.</i>

01:24:39.013 --> 01:24:40.537
I'm an agent with the FBI.

01:24:40.714 --> 01:24:43.808
I need you to connect me
to the Portland field office.

01:24:43.984 --> 01:24:45.076
Do you understand?

01:24:57.698 --> 01:25:00.189
<i>- Yeah.
- It's Owen!</i>

01:25:00.367 --> 01:25:03.131
He's hacked into my car's
computer and my cell phone.

01:25:03.304 --> 01:25:04.737
I'm on the Broadway Bridge.

01:25:04.905 --> 01:25:07.465
Don't move. I'll send a
black-and-white. Stay there.

01:25:07.841 --> 01:25:09.331
All right.

01:26:07.635 --> 01:26:09.728
<i>- Box.
- Lieutenant, I'm on the bridge.</i>

01:26:09.903 --> 01:26:11.336
<i>There's no sign of Marsh.</i>

01:26:11.505 --> 01:26:14.372
Okay. Relay that to FBI Portland.
I'm minutes away.

01:26:15.242 --> 01:26:17.506
- Hurry. Get the director on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:17.678 --> 01:26:20.112
Shut down every road to and from
the Broadway Bridge.

01:26:20.281 --> 01:26:22.306
Every car gets stopped now.

01:27:23.977 --> 01:27:27.242
I need you to run a check
on a 2006 Saab.

01:27:27.414 --> 01:27:30.008
Get me a location, start tracking.
Name: Jennifer Marsh.

01:27:30.184 --> 01:27:31.913
Portland, Oregon.

01:28:13.494 --> 01:28:16.622
Fucker disabled her car's computer.
We can't track her.

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:27.639
Hello.

01:29:09.116 --> 01:29:10.811
You know...

01:29:10.984 --> 01:29:15.421
...l'm only doing to you
what they're going to do to me.

01:29:16.623 --> 01:29:18.250
Only...

01:29:18.559 --> 01:29:23.724
...they'll use potassium chloride, and
they won't let very many people watch.

01:29:25.165 --> 01:29:27.258
But not for long.

01:29:30.938 --> 01:29:32.303
You see, soon...

01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:38.575
...executions will be delivered
live to our TVs...

01:29:39.012 --> 01:29:44.006
...our computers, our phones,
our handhelds...

01:29:44.485 --> 01:29:47.386
...and it won't cost much.

01:29:47.554 --> 01:29:50.580
Maybe 10 bucks.

01:29:59.233 --> 01:30:01.098
Millions of eyes...

01:30:02.769 --> 01:30:06.170
...all watching the same thing
at the same time.

01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:09.665
One big, happy family.

01:30:11.578 --> 01:30:13.739
And all of it brought to you by...

01:30:19.353 --> 01:30:21.287
It doesn't matter.

01:30:25.192 --> 01:30:27.888
They'll have no trouble
finding sponsors.

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:02.228
What's going on?
We have a signal?

01:31:02.396 --> 01:31:03.658
We're still locked out.

01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:06.196
- Stay on it.
- Yes, sir.

01:31:28.622 --> 01:31:31.921
I wonder if they'll kill you
faster or slower.

01:31:34.261 --> 01:31:36.957
Based on what I've seen online...

01:31:37.831 --> 01:31:41.426
...the awful things that men do to
women that other men pay to watch...

01:31:45.739 --> 01:31:48.264
...my guess would be faster.

01:31:52.079 --> 01:31:54.013
Much faster.

01:32:13.166 --> 01:32:15.691
Jesus Christ, it's Marsh!

01:32:29.082 --> 01:32:32.677
- This is Box.
- It's Brooks. He's got Marsh on his site.

01:32:33.654 --> 01:32:35.383
Send it to me.

01:33:55.402 --> 01:33:57.427
You're giving me my best numbers.

01:34:01.341 --> 01:34:04.401
That's... That's her basement.
He's got her in her own basement.

01:34:19.226 --> 01:34:20.659
No, no.

01:34:32.873 --> 01:34:35.137
- Did you see that?
- Fuck!

01:34:37.844 --> 01:34:39.368
Fuck!

01:35:01.868 --> 01:35:03.392
Yes!

01:36:03.393 --> 01:36:04.393
