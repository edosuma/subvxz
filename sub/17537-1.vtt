WEBVTT

00:10.290 --> 00:12.082
( gurgling )

00:12.208 --> 00:14.543
What the hell is this?

00:17.922 --> 00:19.757
So smooth! Huh!

00:24.846 --> 00:26.764
That tastes real good!

00:26.890 --> 00:28.807
Tasty! Sweet!

00:28.933 --> 00:31.977
MAN: Harry, what are you doing
down there? Taking a leak?

00:32.103 --> 00:35.189
- No.
- Want us to wait for ya?

00:35.815 --> 00:40.277
Uh... No, no. You guys go ahead.
I'll catch up to you later.

00:42.989 --> 00:44.948
Well, I'll be damned.

00:45.992 --> 00:49.453
Whatever that could be,
it's mighty good.

00:49.579 --> 00:50.871
Mm.

00:51.748 --> 00:54.124
Harry, what are you doing,
eating snow?

00:54.250 --> 00:58.003
You outta your head, buddy?
If this is snow... Try it.

00:58.129 --> 01:01.173
- No. I don't eat snow.
- C'mon! Give it a try.

01:01.299 --> 01:03.509
That's not snow. Try it.

01:06.888 --> 01:08.931
HARRY: Huh?

01:09.057 --> 01:10.766
What the hell is it?

01:10.892 --> 01:13.894
You know, if this stuff keeps
bubbling out of the ground,

01:14.020 --> 01:17.147
there might be enough over here
that we could sell to people.

01:17.273 --> 01:19.274
BOY: Ow!

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:36.543 --> 01:39.461
Jesus Christ! I'm being eaten alive.

01:45.677 --> 01:47.094
( sighs )

01:47.220 --> 01:49.221
I'm burning hot!

02:31.848 --> 02:33.765
( tap running )

02:49.949 --> 02:52.117
( squelching )

02:57.207 --> 03:00.250
You scared me! You shouldn’t be
walking around here like this.

03:00.376 --> 03:03.378
What are you doing down here? I thought
you were a burglar or something.

03:03.504 --> 03:06.423
- I was hungry.
- You were hungry?

03:07.133 --> 03:08.842
Did you see?

03:09.928 --> 03:12.346
- See what?
- It...

03:13.765 --> 03:16.225
What's the matter with you, anyway?

03:16.851 --> 03:18.852
It was moving!

03:20.230 --> 03:23.482
Listen to me, young man. Get your butt
back to bed! You understand?

03:23.608 --> 03:25.901
Don't ever pull this on me again.
Move!

03:46.714 --> 03:48.548
( cutlery rattles )

03:57.475 --> 04:00.644
When I was a little girl,
I didn't think there was anything

04:00.770 --> 04:02.813
that I liked better than ice cream.

04:03.606 --> 04:05.482
Now I'm a big girl

04:05.608 --> 04:10.779
and I've decided there's something
I like better. Much better.

04:11.656 --> 04:13.865
It's called The Stuff.

04:13.992 --> 04:15.784
And believe me,

04:15.910 --> 04:19.913
enough is never enough.

04:20.498 --> 04:23.125
( seagulls calling )

04:28.965 --> 04:31.800
A month ago, they acquired the
Chocolate Chip Charlie chain of outlets

04:31.926 --> 04:34.803
on the West coast,
with the intention of converting them

04:34.929 --> 04:37.306
and being in business in 60 days.

04:37.432 --> 04:39.850
After that, they'll go national.

04:39.976 --> 04:43.687
I wish to hell we knew how they make it.
Yeah, we could copy it.

04:43.813 --> 04:47.524
What I meant to say is, uh,
"we could, uh, improve on it".

04:47.650 --> 04:51.403
Apparently, we've had no luck
in analyzing the ingredients

04:51.529 --> 04:54.489
and no luck getting close to anybody
inside the company.

04:54.615 --> 04:57.451
That's why I've asked Moe Rutherford
to come here today.

04:57.577 --> 05:02.456
Huh. Look, are you sure we want to get
mixed up with industrial spies?

05:02.582 --> 05:05.292
Look, I want results
and he's the best there is.

05:05.418 --> 05:08.378
It's men like Moe Rutherford
that help us stay in business.

05:08.504 --> 05:12.549
Yes, I suppose we do have to keep
the world safe for ice cream.

05:14.594 --> 05:16.928
Didn't you used to be
with the Bureau?

05:17.055 --> 05:20.432
At least I didn't get my ass kicked out,
like you did.

05:20.558 --> 05:22.225
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

05:22.352 --> 05:25.354
I missed out on Abscam, DeLorean,
all the good times.

05:25.480 --> 05:27.522
Well, just follow me, hotshot!

05:28.608 --> 05:30.692
Let's see if you're worth your money.

05:33.112 --> 05:36.156
Oh! This is some place
you've got here, fellas.

05:36.282 --> 05:38.617
- Hm.
- Gosh! Let me, uh...

05:38.743 --> 05:40.869
That's a sweaty palm.
That's two sweaty palms.

05:40.995 --> 05:43.872
Let me feel you!
Ah! That's another sweaty palm.

05:43.998 --> 05:47.751
- Yes, sir. Hello, sweaty palms.
- How do you do?

05:48.836 --> 05:52.839
- So, tell me about The Stuff.
- You've been briefed on this problem.

05:52.965 --> 05:57.427
Well, I don't understand why you didn't go
to the Food and Drug Administration.

05:57.553 --> 06:01.973
Well, for one reason or another,
right after it was approved,

06:02.100 --> 06:04.476
most of those involved resigned.

06:04.602 --> 06:07.187
They're either out of the country
or on vacation.

06:07.647 --> 06:11.733
Or they have been, uh, paid off!
That is the American way, you know.

06:11.859 --> 06:15.028
We've never had so much trouble
getting information out of a company.

06:15.154 --> 06:18.865
Don't you worry about that.
Every stone wall has a chink in it.

06:18.991 --> 06:22.953
I'll get inside there, penetrate
the company, do some damage.

06:23.079 --> 06:25.414
- But it's going to be expensive.
- Look!

06:26.082 --> 06:29.793
We don't want to know how you do it.
Just, uh... do it!

06:29.919 --> 06:33.880
I understand. You guys don't like me.
I heard it on the tap there.

06:34.006 --> 06:38.385
Someone said I'd been fired
from the FBI, I'd been blackballed,

06:38.511 --> 06:40.554
that I was obscene.

06:40.680 --> 06:43.765
Someone here said I was obscene.
Who said I was obscene?

06:43.891 --> 06:45.559
How the hell did you know that?

06:45.685 --> 06:49.104
Well, while you were
at the Metropolitan Opera last night,

06:49.230 --> 06:52.441
I just happened to be walking
through your hotel room

06:52.567 --> 06:54.776
and I dropped this in your pocket.

06:56.112 --> 06:57.279
Huh?

06:57.405 --> 06:59.114
Oh, shit!

07:04.579 --> 07:06.663
Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch!

07:08.249 --> 07:11.793
- You know, Mr... Uh?
- Rutherford, Moe Rutherford.

07:11.919 --> 07:14.004
- You know why they call me Moe?
- No, why?

07:14.130 --> 07:16.840
'Cause every time people give me money,
I always want mo'.

07:17.717 --> 07:19.718
- Well, you know, Mr Rutherford?
- Yes, sir?

07:19.844 --> 07:23.889
I don't think you're quite as dumb
as you appear to be.

07:24.891 --> 07:28.018
No one is as dumb as I appear to be.

07:28.144 --> 07:29.936
( man chuckles )

07:30.062 --> 07:35.066
Now, as I understand it, there is
a certified check with my name on it.

07:35.193 --> 07:37.694
- The gentleman there.
- Ooh, this fella here?

07:37.820 --> 07:39.529
MOE: Oh, yes. Look at that.

07:39.655 --> 07:41.948
Okay, yeah.

07:42.074 --> 07:44.201
That's good enough for starters.

07:45.995 --> 07:47.329
Asshole!

07:47.455 --> 07:50.373
When you talk to the FBI,
would you tell them this for me?

07:50.500 --> 07:51.583
Ugh!

07:52.376 --> 07:55.837
- Broke his jaw.
- What the hell...?

07:55.963 --> 07:58.173
Uh, thanks for the job, gentlemen.

08:02.470 --> 08:05.347
Will you go up and tell your brother
to get down here?

08:05.473 --> 08:08.225
Oh, come on! My cereal’s gonna get
soggy. I'll get him when I'm done.

08:08.351 --> 08:10.560
Do as I tell you and do it now!

08:11.687 --> 08:13.605
Maybe his alarm didn't go off.

08:13.731 --> 08:17.359
He was up running around in the middle
of the night. No wonder he's exhausted.

08:17.485 --> 08:18.944
( mouths )

08:19.070 --> 08:22.864
Tell him he's not missing school.
I don't care what his excuse is.

08:24.617 --> 08:25.742
Hi.

08:27.036 --> 08:28.745
MOM: There he is!

08:29.914 --> 08:32.874
- What do you want for breakfast?
- Nothing.

08:33.793 --> 08:35.961
I'll scramble a few over easy for you.

08:36.087 --> 08:38.880
Well, uh, my stomach doesn't really
feel too good.

08:39.756 --> 08:43.510
DAD: It sure felt good
at four o’clock this morning!

08:43.635 --> 08:47.347
Listen, young man, you've missed
three days of school already.

08:47.473 --> 08:50.183
You're not missing any more.
I don't know what your plans are today,

08:50.309 --> 08:52.227
but you're not about
to miss any more days.

08:52.353 --> 08:54.854
May I have some?
I've finished my cereal.

08:54.981 --> 08:58.567
- Sure. It's good for you.
- No! Don't eat that!

09:00.111 --> 09:02.654
There's nothing wrong with it.
I had some last night.

09:02.780 --> 09:05.156
I'm telling you, it isn't good.

09:05.283 --> 09:06.700
It's... spoiled.

09:08.160 --> 09:10.537
It doesn't taste spoiled to me.

09:15.418 --> 09:17.502
You taste it and tell me
if you think it's spoiled.

09:17.628 --> 09:18.837
I don't want any.

09:20.798 --> 09:24.467
Look, it moves around all by itself.

09:26.304 --> 09:30.557
It moves!
I saw it move in the refrigerator.

09:33.394 --> 09:35.687
Hey, freak!
What are you on, anyway?

09:38.482 --> 09:42.611
- Jason! You come back here!
- I hope these stains come out.

09:42.737 --> 09:46.740
- What's the matter with that boy?
- Look at that. Not a spot.

09:46.866 --> 09:50.452
Low in calories, good tasting
and it doesn't even spot.

09:50.578 --> 09:51.953
And he doesn't like it.

09:56.083 --> 09:59.878
- There's nothing like it around.
- Coupled with benign bacteria?

10:00.004 --> 10:03.089
It was probably just a lucky accident
that tasted great.

10:03.215 --> 10:05.925
They seem to reproduce this accident
in great quantities.

10:06.052 --> 10:08.678
Well, that's what I don't understand.

10:08.804 --> 10:12.515
I thought some government regulation
requires them to reveal the contents.

10:12.642 --> 10:16.811
They're protected by the FDA's
Statute of Identity's rule.

10:16.937 --> 10:22.067
The same law protects Coca-Cola’s
secret formula for their syrup.

10:22.735 --> 10:25.403
MOE: Gentlemen,
the little lady entering the room

10:25.529 --> 10:28.448
is doing some
undercover research for me.

10:28.574 --> 10:32.327
Because, folks, if we're going to
find out the secret formula of Stuff,

10:32.453 --> 10:34.412
we're going to have to steal it.

10:34.538 --> 10:35.997
( music plays )

10:36.123 --> 10:39.626
WOMAN: A little faster paced. Okay?
Let's get movement into this. Step, step!

10:39.752 --> 10:44.005
Let's see the bathing suits.
Okay, I want wonderful smiles.

10:44.131 --> 10:47.133
- You got that, is it good?
- MAN: Yes.

10:47.259 --> 10:51.179
Now I want you to feed each other
The Stuff with nice smiles on your face.

10:51.305 --> 10:54.974
♪ My lips crave more and more
each day ♪

10:55.101 --> 10:58.144
♪ One lick is never enough
of The Stuff... ♪

10:58.270 --> 11:01.940
Pearl and Cathy, get a slightly
tighter shot of them, will you?

11:02.066 --> 11:05.527
- MAN: You want me to move in?
- As they come forward, move in.

11:05.653 --> 11:07.237
Can you get it?

11:10.199 --> 11:14.119
Go in for a close-up of the faces of
these two 'cause they're real beauties.

11:14.245 --> 11:16.621
Let me see how much you love it!

11:16.747 --> 11:19.582
Very good. Thanks, girls.

11:20.876 --> 11:23.044
Okay, Christine, by yourself.

11:23.170 --> 11:26.381
Right to the lens. Right here.

11:26.507 --> 11:29.175
I'm going to want you to go in
for a tight close-up

11:29.301 --> 11:31.761
- as she feeds the camera.
- ( whispers )

11:31.887 --> 11:35.014
What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

11:35.141 --> 11:37.559
- Who the hell are you?
- Everybody break for five minutes.

11:37.685 --> 11:41.354
I got to talk to Miss Kendall about
her employment and this job.

11:41.480 --> 11:44.399
You all can break. Coffee?
You can take off with that.

11:44.525 --> 11:46.860
Kill the lights and the sound.
You got that?

11:46.986 --> 11:48.820
- ( music stops )
- What...?

11:48.946 --> 11:51.781
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but I can't wait in line.

11:51.907 --> 11:55.201
I can tell you're not the type
of person to wait in line either.

11:55.327 --> 11:58.204
You didn't get where you are now
by waiting in line, did you?

11:59.415 --> 12:03.710
- How do you know that story?
- That's the way I got where I am.

12:03.836 --> 12:07.756
And here I am with you
and you're awful pretty.

12:07.882 --> 12:12.051
- "David...Rutherford?"
- Moe! My friends call me Moe.

12:12.178 --> 12:15.805
They call me Moe 'cause every time they
give me something, I always want mo'!

12:18.517 --> 12:21.853
And I suppose you're wondering
what I want out of you.

12:21.979 --> 12:25.356
Yes, I'd like to know
what this was all about.

12:25.483 --> 12:28.693
I want to put you on
our public relations campaign.

12:28.819 --> 12:33.198
I need you not just to raise the image,
you gotta convince the public

12:33.324 --> 12:39.078
that Lee-High Petroleum
has the public’s interest at heart.

12:39.205 --> 12:42.749
Oh! But... But why me?

12:42.875 --> 12:46.628
Well, I mean,
look what you did for The Stuff!

12:46.754 --> 12:50.298
You invented the name,
as I understand it.

12:50.424 --> 12:53.760
You created the image and put
the whole sales pitch together.

12:53.886 --> 12:56.471
That's why I don't have a lot
of time for petroleum companies.

12:56.597 --> 12:59.390
Well, darling,
I'm not here to hire your agency.

12:59.517 --> 13:02.310
I want to buy your agency
and put you in charge.

13:04.313 --> 13:06.272
Oh! Oh! Um...

13:06.398 --> 13:10.151
You want to buy the agency
and make?... That clarifies things.

13:10.277 --> 13:12.737
Will you just sit right there one second.

13:12.863 --> 13:15.573
Mitzi? Mitzi.

13:17.827 --> 13:20.995
I want you to check out this guy
thoroughly and get back to me.

13:21.121 --> 13:24.916
I want you to cancel my dinner date
and go get me a dress to wear.

13:25.042 --> 13:27.210
No, problem.
Right away, Miss Kendall.

13:29.046 --> 13:31.965
So, you were saying?

13:33.717 --> 13:36.427
I do like to see a woman
with decision.

13:37.513 --> 13:39.222
Pick your favorite restaurant.

13:39.974 --> 13:42.350
Mm... Where are you staying?

13:43.018 --> 13:44.185
The Sherry-Netherland.

13:45.104 --> 13:48.314
Do they have room service
at the Sherry-Netherland?

13:48.440 --> 13:50.900
My limousine's just outside.

13:54.154 --> 13:55.864
So is mine.

13:55.990 --> 13:58.199
I'm betting mine's bigger than yours.

13:58.325 --> 14:00.660
( baby crying )

14:00.786 --> 14:02.453
( scanners beeping )

14:21.015 --> 14:23.808
- Hey, give me that!
- Give me that back!

14:23.934 --> 14:26.019
What do you think you're doing?

14:27.938 --> 14:31.107
Wait! Come back here, kid!

14:33.319 --> 14:35.904
MAN ON PA: <i>Security to aisle seven,
please.</i>

14:36.030 --> 14:39.949
<i>All security personnel
to aisle seven, please.</i>

14:53.339 --> 14:54.923
Oh, shit!

15:13.359 --> 15:16.069
Get off me! Let me go!

15:16.195 --> 15:17.445
Please!

15:19.239 --> 15:20.865
Let go!

15:21.492 --> 15:23.159
It's gonna kill you all!

15:39.259 --> 15:41.386
( doorbell )

15:41.512 --> 15:43.054
( growling )

15:43.722 --> 15:45.181
( doorbell )

15:46.558 --> 15:50.019
Hello, Mr Vickers.
I called you about an appointment.

15:50.145 --> 15:52.480
Sure, the man
from Consumer Magazine?

15:52.606 --> 15:55.733
- Yeah, that's right.
- Well, come on in.

15:55.859 --> 15:58.194
( dog growling and snarling )

16:05.327 --> 16:08.579
- Is he friendly?
- He's absolutely harmless.

16:08.706 --> 16:10.957
- How old is he?
- One year.

16:11.083 --> 16:15.545
- One year old? He's awful big.
- I feed him very well.

16:15.671 --> 16:18.673
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thanks. I'm off that now.

16:18.799 --> 16:22.427
I'm glad to hear that. The liquor
can kill you. It ought to be outlawed.

16:24.013 --> 16:28.850
Mr Vickers, how long have you been
with the Food and Drug Administration?

16:30.602 --> 16:32.812
Almost 19 years.

16:32.938 --> 16:35.523
Yeah, pretty soon
they'll be retiring me.

16:35.649 --> 16:37.400
( growling )

16:38.235 --> 16:41.154
And as I understand it,
you were part of the team

16:41.280 --> 16:44.615
that tested and approved
a product called The Stuff.

16:44.742 --> 16:46.868
They didn't have a name for it then.

16:46.994 --> 16:50.079
They merchandised the hell out of it,
but we agreed it was a good product.

16:50.205 --> 16:53.041
How long was it tested
before you approved it?

16:53.167 --> 16:57.920
You've got to understand
that this is a dessert,

16:58.047 --> 17:00.339
not a prescription medicine.

17:00.466 --> 17:04.510
Not any different from yogurt
or ice cream.

17:04.636 --> 17:06.846
What's in The Stuff?
What's it made out of?

17:06.972 --> 17:08.806
How's it made?

17:11.769 --> 17:13.685
- What was your name again?
- Rutherford.

17:13.811 --> 17:15.646
- Rutherford.
- Moe Rutherford.

17:15.772 --> 17:17.565
I hope...

17:17.691 --> 17:20.818
I hope you're not going to tell me
that there's been some trouble,

17:20.944 --> 17:24.946
- I mean someone's allergic to it.
- That would upset you, wouldn’t it?

17:25.074 --> 17:30.078
Look, all we can do is look for
something common to most people.

17:30.204 --> 17:35.374
If there's no reason to forbid the use
of a product, then we have to okay it.

17:35.501 --> 17:36.793
( growling )

17:36.919 --> 17:39.587
- And in this case, it was...
- ( snarling )

17:39.713 --> 17:41.964
In this case it was a pleasure.

17:42.091 --> 17:44.759
It was an absolute pleasure
because I love it! I love it!

17:44.885 --> 17:47.428
- Oh, you eat The Stuff?
- All the time.

17:47.554 --> 17:50.932
- I feed it to Ben. Ben has some.
- You feed the dog The Stuff?

17:51.058 --> 17:53.184
Absolutely. Ben eats it all the time.
Right, Ben?

17:53.310 --> 17:55.311
( growling )

17:55.437 --> 17:59.398
Well, I... I suppose if both of you eat it,
it's got to be all right.

17:59.525 --> 18:02.985
- Yes. It's really good.
- ( snarling, barking )

18:03.112 --> 18:06.322
But I understand that
you're not a chemist, Mr Vickers.

18:06.448 --> 18:10.243
No. I'm an administrator, but, uh...

18:10.369 --> 18:13.079
but I can give you the names
of some of the people on the panel.

18:13.205 --> 18:16.415
Well, I tried that already
and for some strange reason,

18:16.542 --> 18:19.085
they're all out of the country
or deceased.

18:19.211 --> 18:22.588
- What a shame.
- Yeah.

18:24.591 --> 18:27.176
Say, where did you test The Stuff?

18:27.302 --> 18:29.095
- Stader.
- Stader Virginia?

18:29.221 --> 18:32.265
I still have some preliminary
worksheets in my office.

18:32.391 --> 18:34.767
Maybe you should look at them.
Nothing confidential.

18:34.893 --> 18:38.980
I'd appreciate that. I'd Xerox them
and send them right back to you.

18:39.106 --> 18:41.607
You're lucky.
I never throw anything away.

18:41.733 --> 18:43.234
( dog panting )

18:43.360 --> 18:46.237
- ( barking )
- Ben! Good boy!

18:51.368 --> 18:54.787
Why is your master afraid of you?
Huh?

18:58.125 --> 19:00.418
You hungry? Want something to eat?

19:00.544 --> 19:03.004
Come on. Let's go in the kitchen.

19:14.892 --> 19:18.895
Oh, I'm sorry. I should have offered
you a cup of coffee or a soft drink.

19:19.021 --> 19:21.522
I felt like a glass of water,
but I'm not thirsty any more.

19:21.648 --> 19:24.859
These are some of my old documents,
just a lot of old names.

19:24.985 --> 19:27.945
Well, thanks very much.
I appreciate it.

19:28.071 --> 19:29.947
It's my pleasure. ( chuckles )

19:35.662 --> 19:38.372
I'll get copies of this
as soon as possible.

19:38.498 --> 19:41.167
- Well, take your time.
- Goodbye, Ben!

19:47.257 --> 19:49.759
- ( Ben whines )
- You've been a good boy, Ben.

19:49.885 --> 19:53.721
I've got a treat for you.
In fact, I have a treat for both of us.

19:54.765 --> 19:56.057
We deserve it, don't we?

20:00.187 --> 20:01.938

21:24.521 --> 21:26.147

21:26.273 --> 21:28.482
MAN: Okay, I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

21:28.608 --> 21:31.652
- What can I do for you?
- Fill her up.

21:31.778 --> 21:34.864
Fill her up. Yeah.

21:35.949 --> 21:38.868
There's nice clean restrooms
out there, if you want to.

21:38.994 --> 21:42.621
I must have taken the wrong turn-off
here somewhere.

21:42.748 --> 21:45.916
- This is Stader, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

21:46.043 --> 21:49.003
I know somebody here.
I can't remember his name. Uh...

21:49.129 --> 21:51.047
- Melville.
- ( bell rings )

21:51.173 --> 21:53.382
You mean old Harold? He moved out.

21:53.508 --> 21:57.845
- They're just about all moving out of here.
- Ain't nobody here but you?

21:57.971 --> 22:01.265
Don't you want to wash your hands?
I put in a new towel.

22:01.391 --> 22:03.517
- ( bell ringing )
- Could you stop that at $20?

22:04.394 --> 22:06.228
Okay, yeah. Sure.

22:12.903 --> 22:15.196
Do you recognize that car down there?

22:16.865 --> 22:18.032
No.

22:19.159 --> 22:23.162
Ain't that a novelty?
Two strangers in one day.

23:03.662 --> 23:06.705
Hi-yah! Hah!

23:08.083 --> 23:09.583
Ow!

23:15.590 --> 23:17.299
You're Chocolate Chip Charlie!

23:17.426 --> 23:21.345
Well, I sure as hell ain't
the Kentucky Colonel! Get off of me.

23:21.471 --> 23:25.850
I'm sorry. What are you doing in a town
like this, big executive like you?

23:25.976 --> 23:28.394
I'm trying to find out somethin'
about the sons-of-bitches

23:28.520 --> 23:31.897
who stole my company and threw me
out on my beautiful black ass!

23:32.023 --> 23:35.067
- You work for them, huh?
- I'm investigating them, same as you.

23:35.193 --> 23:37.111
Those shits!

23:37.237 --> 23:40.906
Somehow, man, they got to my asshole
brother and my two idiot nephews

23:41.032 --> 23:43.826
and everybody else
I trusted with stock.

23:43.952 --> 23:48.289
And they brainwashed them, man!
Next thing, they was in and I was out!

23:48.415 --> 23:50.583
Yeah, Okay, Charlie.
Did you find anything out?

23:50.709 --> 23:54.879
What you gonna find out in a town
that's been dried up and blown away?

23:55.005 --> 23:56.088
( dog barking )

23:56.965 --> 24:00.968
Must be a side-effect of eating too
much dessert. An urge to migrate.

24:01.094 --> 24:03.762
There's a widespread urge of that
around here.

24:03.889 --> 24:07.475
I might have gone along with the idea.
They didn't have to steal my company.

24:07.601 --> 24:10.019
These guys don't like having partners,
Charlie.

24:10.145 --> 24:14.023
I figured if they was a Mafia front,
I'd get back at 'em, expose 'em.

24:14.149 --> 24:17.818
- And then get my company back.
- But how did you find this place?

24:17.944 --> 24:19.987
Those damned relatives of mine again.

24:20.113 --> 24:23.782
After they voted me off the board of
directors, you know what they did?

24:23.909 --> 24:28.579
They hid from me, man, disappeared
because they knew I'd kill 'em!

24:28.705 --> 24:31.749
Then they left this place here
as a forwarding address.

24:31.875 --> 24:33.751
- A forwarding address?
- Yeah.

24:34.836 --> 24:36.545
Well, that's a Post Office.

24:39.925 --> 24:42.176
Where does that mail get rerouted to?

24:42.302 --> 24:46.555
Oh, to these people,
the addresses they left behind.

24:46.681 --> 24:51.185
But I don't see that's
any i-interest, uh, to you.

24:52.979 --> 24:56.357
Midland, Georgia. Midland, Georgia.
Midland, Georgia.

24:56.483 --> 25:00.027
A whole lot of folks have relocated
to Midland, Georgia, man.

25:01.988 --> 25:05.115
It's dinner time.
Why don't you close up shop?

25:05.242 --> 25:07.493
We’ll take you out for a bite to eat.

25:07.619 --> 25:10.204
I've...eaten already.

25:10.330 --> 25:12.540
Midland, Georgia, huh?

25:12.666 --> 25:15.543
They all went there
and you stayed here?

25:16.253 --> 25:18.212
Go away.

25:18.838 --> 25:21.632
- Leave us alone.
- What do you mean "us", man?

25:21.758 --> 25:25.052
We're talkin' to you. Ain't nobody
else in this place, is there?

25:25.178 --> 25:29.932
All we see is you and the gas
station man and now he's gone.

25:30.058 --> 25:32.309
We're not...bothering anybody.

25:32.435 --> 25:33.644
( croaking )

25:35.564 --> 25:37.189
Excuse me.

25:37.315 --> 25:39.066
I'll be right back.

25:46.825 --> 25:48.909
( door creaking )

25:51.288 --> 25:52.788
What do you think, Charlie?

25:52.914 --> 25:55.082
The man is not in proper operating order.

25:55.208 --> 25:56.458
Absolutely!

25:56.585 --> 25:58.168
I'd like to take him some place
and get him X-rayed.

25:58.295 --> 26:00.045
What if he doesn't want to come
along?

26:00.171 --> 26:02.131
- We snatch him.
- Now, Charlie.

26:02.257 --> 26:04.758
I run a high-tech operation.
I don't go in for things like that.

26:04.884 --> 26:08.470
I got a few lo-tech solutions.
We hit that sucker over the head...

26:08.597 --> 26:11.307
Ooh, well... We could do that.

26:11.433 --> 26:13.767
- We throw him in the trunk of the car.
- We could do that, too.

26:13.893 --> 26:16.437
- And we take off.
- But whose car?

26:16.563 --> 26:18.355
( groaning )

26:25.572 --> 26:28.115
I'll be right there, baby.

26:30.577 --> 26:31.994
Hello?

26:36.499 --> 26:40.919
- Okay, lethal hands. Kill the door.
- Okay. Watch out for splinters.

26:43.048 --> 26:44.632
I always knock first.

26:48.053 --> 26:49.637
Huh!

27:01.024 --> 27:04.360
- ( whispers ) What happened to him?
- Nobody's mouth can open that wide!

27:08.073 --> 27:10.240
You are not thinking about
going after it?

27:10.367 --> 27:12.451
I hope you got a gun on you, Charlie.

27:12.577 --> 27:16.163
- My hands are lethal weapons!
- I hope you're right.

27:16.289 --> 27:20.209
Because if that thing
tries to kill me, you kill me first.

27:26.508 --> 27:31.428
- Wait, wait, wait. We are not alone.
- ( footsteps running )

27:32.138 --> 27:35.182
The only thing Chocolate Chip Charlie
knows better than fighting is running.

27:35.308 --> 27:37.101
Pick a direction.

27:43.566 --> 27:45.317
- Get in that...
- ( yelling )

27:46.653 --> 27:48.487
MOE: Get in that boat, Charlie.

27:48.613 --> 27:50.864
I just knocked a hole in that sucker!

27:52.867 --> 27:53.951
( gurgling )

27:54.077 --> 27:56.412
Get in the boat!

28:20.687 --> 28:22.896
- Honey, you got a coffee for me?
- Sure do.

28:23.022 --> 28:25.149
You're a pretty thing! Look at her.
Isn't she pretty?

28:25.275 --> 28:26.275
Mm-hm.

28:26.401 --> 28:30.279
Every time I feel like eating,
I think of that guy with the mouth.

28:30.405 --> 28:33.073
- It turns me right off my stomach.
- ( Charlie chuckles )

28:33.199 --> 28:36.869
Hey, waitress. You got any good
chocolate chip cookies?

28:36.995 --> 28:39.204
Sure do. Home-made.

28:39.330 --> 28:41.331
You got any of The Stuff?

28:41.458 --> 28:43.709
( country music plays on jukebox )

28:44.502 --> 28:48.464
Wish I did. I can't get it.
It's on order, though.

28:50.300 --> 28:51.508
Charles?

28:55.305 --> 28:57.931
You and I are gonna have to split up.

28:58.892 --> 29:02.227
You sure you no longer need
my iron fists?

29:04.439 --> 29:07.524
I want you to go to Washington DC

29:07.650 --> 29:11.445
and see Special Agent
Frank Herbert...

29:12.197 --> 29:14.698
( whispers ) from the FBI.

29:17.368 --> 29:21.079
He won't believe me.
Maybe he'll believe you.

29:21.206 --> 29:24.792
- Uh... Frank Herbert, the FBI?
- Ssh!

29:24.918 --> 29:26.752
I got ya.

29:26.878 --> 29:29.254
( Charlie laughs )

29:29.380 --> 29:31.715
There you go, honey. Thanks a lot.

29:32.967 --> 29:37.095
Hey, fellas. Any of you going down
to Route 105 could give a guy a lift?

29:37.222 --> 29:40.140
- Yeah. I'm just about done.
- Ooh, good. Thanks very much.

29:40.266 --> 29:42.893
- Is your friend coming with you?
- No. He's got other business.

29:43.019 --> 29:46.396
Charlie! Remember where you are.

30:18.513 --> 30:20.430
Here he comes.

30:27.021 --> 30:28.730
( tires screech )

30:30.817 --> 30:32.734
( horns honking )

30:38.658 --> 30:41.535
- You're Mr Rutherford.
- That's right.

30:41.661 --> 30:43.704
I expected you about now.

30:43.830 --> 30:49.001
I gather Stader wasn't a rather
congenial community for you.

30:49.669 --> 30:52.087
- News travels fast.
- Hm.

30:53.673 --> 30:58.635
You're not one of 'em, are you, huh?
You're not on The Stuff, are you?

30:58.761 --> 31:02.931
Oh, no, no. My doctor would never
allow me to take any of that.

31:03.057 --> 31:05.309
But you distribute it.
You know what it is.

31:05.435 --> 31:07.728
You put it in the stores
and the supermarkets.

31:07.854 --> 31:09.438
I know what it is?
Don't be ridiculous.

31:09.564 --> 31:11.523
I don't know what it is.
Does anybody know what it is?

31:11.649 --> 31:13.609
I only made it what it was.

31:13.735 --> 31:17.613
Those who would take
a critical mass of it, it's everything.

31:17.739 --> 31:23.076
Those people who discovered it and
brought it to me were already addicted.

31:23.202 --> 31:25.662
They were compelled
to find somebody like me

31:25.788 --> 31:27.623
who could market it
in the tens of millions.

31:27.749 --> 31:31.627
That was long before you
test-marketed the product in Stader.

31:31.753 --> 31:33.170
Where did it all start?

31:34.589 --> 31:37.799
Everyone in Stader went to a little
town called Midland, Georgia.

31:37.926 --> 31:42.304
Now, your conglomerate owns
a mining company in Midland?

31:42.430 --> 31:46.266
Let go of it, Mr Rutherford.
You can't stop it.

31:46.392 --> 31:48.435
I can shut you down.

31:49.395 --> 31:52.230
( laughing ) I don't know.
I really don't know.

31:52.357 --> 31:54.942
I don't think anybody
would pay much attention

31:55.068 --> 31:57.277
to a disreputable character like you.

31:57.403 --> 32:00.030
You're a rogue, you're a crook

32:00.156 --> 32:04.952
in the pay of ice-cream companies
trying to screw the competition.

32:05.620 --> 32:07.496
I could always kill you.

32:07.622 --> 32:09.456
( laughs nervously )

32:10.124 --> 32:12.584
Or you could come to work for me.

32:12.710 --> 32:14.920
Let me show you something.

32:16.464 --> 32:20.717
I had a little envelope here for you
in anticipation of your arrival.

32:23.304 --> 32:26.640
- What do you think of that?
- $1,000 bills?

32:26.766 --> 32:29.601
- About 25 of them?
- Hey! Right on!

32:30.395 --> 32:34.856
Also a first draft of a contract
to supervise our security here.

32:34.983 --> 32:37.442
You do know who I am, don't you?

32:37.568 --> 32:38.735
Mm.

32:38.861 --> 32:41.238
I don't have to eat The Stuff though,
do I?

32:41.364 --> 32:43.407
I would like to leave that
to the Stuffies.

32:43.533 --> 32:46.118
- It's not your fault.
- It is my fault.

32:46.244 --> 32:48.996
I invented the whole campaign
that made it so popular.

32:49.122 --> 32:51.164
Are you the only person
ever done anything wrong?

32:51.290 --> 32:54.292
No, I know I'm not the only person
that ever did anything wrong.

32:54.419 --> 32:57.629
Do you want to trade sins,
Miss Kendall?

32:57.755 --> 33:01.299
All right. I'll trade a sin with you.

33:01.426 --> 33:04.344
I am not an oil millionaire.

33:04.470 --> 33:06.471
- I'm an industrial saboteur.
- ( she laughs )

33:09.434 --> 33:13.603
Why don't you just call the FBI
and tell them what you know?

33:13.730 --> 33:15.897
I haven't got any credibility
with the Bureau

33:16.024 --> 33:18.483
or any other Federal agency,
for that matter.

33:18.609 --> 33:20.819
I was one of them.
They kicked me out.

33:20.945 --> 33:25.949
- Um... What about Ralph Nader?
- Oh, I got a bad name with him, too.

33:26.075 --> 33:29.745
A couple of motorcar companies
hired me to discredit consumer groups.

33:29.871 --> 33:32.247
- I did too good a job.
- But if you've got proof...

33:32.373 --> 33:34.416
- we've got to go to somebody...
- I don't have any proof.

33:34.542 --> 33:35.959
I got no proof at all.

33:36.085 --> 33:39.463
That's why I gotta go to the factory
with you tonight to get proof.

33:39.589 --> 33:41.798
- Tonight?
- David, you seen this?

33:42.717 --> 33:45.343
Oh, hi, doc. This is Nicole.

33:45.470 --> 33:47.929
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you.

33:48.056 --> 33:50.515
Some kid on Long Island sure as hell
doesn't like The Stuff for breakfast.

33:50.641 --> 33:52.768
Went bonkers in a local supermarket.

33:55.938 --> 33:57.731
I've got to see that kid.

33:59.233 --> 34:01.693
- Honey, I'll see you at the airport tonight.
- What?

34:01.819 --> 34:04.780
Doc, would you see Miss Kendall
home, please?

Hey, look. He's here.

35:35.371 --> 35:36.872
So, what you looking at?

35:36.998 --> 35:39.791
- Is that dinner?
- We're dieting.

35:39.917 --> 35:42.919
I've lost five pounds this week
and I've never felt better.

35:43.045 --> 35:45.088
Why are you talking
like you're on a commercial?

35:45.214 --> 35:47.215
Here, Jason, take some.

35:48.509 --> 35:51.178
You know what I said about that.
That was the truth.

35:52.054 --> 35:56.474
And you know that there is
something alive in there.

35:56.601 --> 36:01.021
Jason, there's something alive in yogurt.
It's called benign bacteria.

36:01.147 --> 36:03.648
- Yes!
- There's something alive in bread.

36:03.774 --> 36:05.317
It's yeast. That's a living organism.

36:05.443 --> 36:08.403
We eat plenty of things
that are still alive that are good for us.

36:08.529 --> 36:11.823
I know that, but...that was moving.

36:11.949 --> 36:16.161
All micro-organisms move, Jason, if
you could see them with the naked eye.

36:16.287 --> 36:19.456
Under a microscope you see them move.
What's the difference?

36:19.582 --> 36:24.544
They're good for us, Jason.
They kill the bad things inside us.

36:24.670 --> 36:26.671
( bleeping from video game )

36:27.757 --> 36:30.759
He's just a baby.
Always afraid of everything.

36:32.762 --> 36:34.554
Get him!

36:43.981 --> 36:44.940
Help!

36:53.449 --> 36:57.202
- What am I supposed to do?
- You're supposed to eat it.

36:57.328 --> 37:01.039
Eat as much of it as you can
and you keep eating it.

37:04.252 --> 37:06.628
We thought you loved this house, Jason.
That's why we bought it.

37:06.754 --> 37:09.339
What about your new room!
We got you everything you asked for.

37:09.465 --> 37:11.675
Are we asking you for so much?

37:16.973 --> 37:19.015
You always get everything you want.

37:32.822 --> 37:34.781
Stay in your room
until you finish that.

37:34.907 --> 37:37.826
Then you can become
a part of the family again.

39:13.297 --> 39:14.798
Hey!

39:16.092 --> 39:19.427
What are you doing down here?
Dad said stay upstairs and eat it.

39:20.346 --> 39:22.263
He was right.

39:22.390 --> 39:24.933
I tried some of it and he was right.

39:27.978 --> 39:30.980
Hey! That's mine!

39:31.107 --> 39:32.732
Sure it is.

39:32.858 --> 39:35.485
Hey, Dad. Jason loves it.

39:36.862 --> 39:38.780
Jason always did have
a hell of an appetite.

39:38.906 --> 39:42.450
- Why don't you have some more?
- Still working on this one.

39:42.576 --> 39:44.744
Then I'll have some more.

39:44.870 --> 39:47.622
Books off the table. Glasses off.

39:48.249 --> 39:51.501
As a matter of fact, I'll take
a whole bunch of it up to my room.

39:53.212 --> 39:55.588
Just in case
I get a little bit hungry.

39:58.884 --> 40:00.593

40:00.719 --> 40:04.180

- Get in the car!
- Who are you?

40:31.542 --> 40:33.668

40:55.900 --> 40:57.984
Ex... Excuse me, sir.

40:58.986 --> 41:00.862
I kinda just threw up in your car.

41:00.988 --> 41:02.614
I know!

41:04.116 --> 41:06.159
I'm sorry! I mean...

41:06.285 --> 41:09.037
- That's all right.
- I just ate shaving cream.

41:09.163 --> 41:13.374
Everybody has to eat shaving cream
once in a while.

41:21.091 --> 41:23.760
You feelin' a little better?
Would you open the window now?

41:25.095 --> 41:27.597
- Open the window?
- Mm-hm.

41:36.815 --> 41:38.274
MOE: All aboard for Georgia!

41:41.654 --> 41:44.072

41:44.198 --> 41:47.575
- Are we all set to go?
- Well, we got this ex-con here.

Wow! I've never been
in a plane like this before.

42:00.714 --> 42:02.423

42:02.550 --> 42:05.093
Fletcher's conglomerate

42:05.219 --> 42:07.387
owns mines and quarries

42:07.513 --> 42:09.180
There's got to be a connection.

42:19.066 --> 42:21.818
Thank you. Very nice flight.

42:21.944 --> 42:24.153
- Are you Miss Butterman?

- My name is Michael Grimsby.

42:48.429 --> 42:51.055
Grimsby and Howard,
Howard and Grimsby. Yeah.

42:51.181 --> 42:55.643
Didn't you gentlemen live in
the town of Stader, one time or other?

42:57.938 --> 43:00.607
- Uh... How do you know that?
- Well...

43:00.733 --> 43:03.651
That's where the tests were done
by the Food and Drug Administration?

43:03.777 --> 43:05.528
That's how we heard about it.

43:05.654 --> 43:08.656
I had my own business,
but I gave it up to join the firm.

43:08.782 --> 43:13.703
We were both convinced
that this is the product of tomorrow.

43:18.417 --> 43:22.712
Look at those tall stacks!
All full of The Stuff, huh?

44:10.094 --> 44:12.345
- Call me Cassidy.
- What?

44:12.471 --> 44:16.057
- Cassidy, I'm the company foreman.
- Nice to meet you.

44:16.183 --> 44:19.852
Thank you for the wonderful job you
people do down on Madison Avenue.

44:19.978 --> 44:24.357
Oh, it's very easy to sell a product
when people like it so much.

44:24.483 --> 44:26.442
Yes, we like it ourselves.

44:26.568 --> 44:30.113
It's tough to keep the workmen
from eating up all the profits!

NICOLE: This is very,
very interesting, Mr Cassidy,

44:59.852 --> 45:01.394
but I think that
what we'd like to see

45:01.520 --> 45:05.481
is the room where they put
all the ingredients together,

45:05.607 --> 45:07.525
where they mix The Stuff.

45:07.651 --> 45:10.820
Oh, now, that's a state secret.
We're very tight on that subject.

45:10.946 --> 45:15.658

an entire crew down from New York

45:16.285 --> 45:21.080

Take your hands away.

49:43.385 --> 49:44.927
I'm gonna burn it.

49:56.815 --> 49:59.358
MOE: It hardened on my face.

50:01.194 --> 50:03.904
Leave us alone! Leave us alone!

50:04.031 --> 50:06.115
Oh, God!

50:08.744 --> 50:10.453
( cries out )

50:13.290 --> 50:14.957
Help me!

50:15.083 --> 50:16.625
MOE: Look! That's meant for us!

50:16.752 --> 50:18.377
NICOLE: It's killing him!

50:20.464 --> 50:23.507
- Help him, Moe.
- I'll burn the hell out of it.

50:25.677 --> 50:27.344
( man yelling )

50:37.606 --> 50:39.732
( choking and spluttering )

50:57.584 --> 50:59.627
Don't touch me.

50:59.753 --> 51:02.797
- Are you all right?
- Get in that truck. I'll hotwire it.

51:08.136 --> 51:09.678
( screaming )

51:12.182 --> 51:15.184
What if somebody reports the truck
stolen and we're arrested?

51:15.310 --> 51:18.145
We just tell them
that fella tried to kill us.

51:18.271 --> 51:21.899
- Where are we going?
- We're going back to the factory.

51:22.025 --> 51:24.693
We're gonna take our own guided tour.

51:35.956 --> 51:37.164
Ow!

51:37.290 --> 51:45.381
( horn honks )

51:46.424 --> 51:48.050
Where are they going at this hour?

51:48.176 --> 51:52.096
Good time to travel when you don't
want to be seen. Let's find out.

53:01.958 --> 53:03.626
( engine off )

53:03.752 --> 53:07.087
Can't go much further with this damned
thing. It's making too much noise.

53:17.641 --> 53:19.558
NICOLE: What's that light up ahead?

53:27.108 --> 53:28.484
( gurgling )

53:30.695 --> 53:32.821
NICOLE: What the hell are they doing?

53:32.948 --> 53:34.907
MOE: That stuff comes right out
of the center of the Earth.

53:36.618 --> 53:38.827
And straight into our supermarkets.

53:39.746 --> 53:43.082
Do you mean they don't process it
or manufacture it at all?

53:43.208 --> 53:45.709
No, they siphon it right off
and into the trucks.

53:47.212 --> 53:50.214
The only way I can prove that
is to steal one of those trucks.

53:53.551 --> 53:56.720
You can't do that. This place is
wide open. They're going to see you.

53:56.846 --> 53:59.848
- Not if I have this on.
- Oh, my God!

53:59.975 --> 54:03.310
No wonder you saved that thing
instead of my pocket book.

54:14.572 --> 54:16.532
( knuckles crack )

54:16.658 --> 54:18.117
Ssh!

54:18.243 --> 54:19.535
I'm sorry.

54:36.261 --> 54:39.847
I want you to go back to the pickup.
The keys are under the floorboard.

54:39.973 --> 54:44.560
Meet me at Route 5 near the parkway.
All right?

54:44.686 --> 54:47.896
- You gonna be all right?
- I'll be fine. This is my business.

54:48.023 --> 54:50.899
- You look kinda cute in this thing.
- Yeah?

54:53.820 --> 54:55.195
I do love encouragement.

54:57.073 --> 54:59.199
( The Stuff gurgling )

55:05.332 --> 55:08.208
MAN ON PA: <i>It's coming down
in great masses tonight.</i>

55:08.335 --> 55:12.796
<i>Be grateful for its plentiful supply
and for the good work we are doing.</i>

55:12.922 --> 55:16.717
<i>Soon, the hunger in the world
will be a thing of the past.</i>

55:16.843 --> 55:20.512
<i>The Earth is giving off the food
that will nourish all</i>

55:20.638 --> 55:23.557
<i>and guide us all
to a new order of life.</i>

55:34.944 --> 55:36.737
( gurgling )

56:05.266 --> 56:07.476
( pump whirring )

56:33.002 --> 56:34.962
( pump vibrating )

56:38.425 --> 56:40.259
Oh, no!

56:41.511 --> 56:44.221
Oh, my God!
God! I'm gonna drown in The Stuff!

56:50.937 --> 56:52.354
( slurping and gurgling )

56:58.820 --> 57:00.904
Get me out of here!
Help!

57:04.993 --> 57:06.410
Howdy.

57:11.040 --> 57:13.083
Well, what are you waiting for?

57:13.918 --> 57:15.711
Why don't you do something?

57:17.297 --> 57:19.965
JASON: <i>Why don't you do something
to me?</i>

57:23.428 --> 57:25.596
JASON: <i>Let me out of here! Help!</i>

57:25.722 --> 57:26.889
( truck horn blows )

57:31.811 --> 57:33.479
Jason?

57:33.605 --> 57:37.065
MOE: <i>I'll get you out of there.</i>
MAN: <i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

57:37.942 --> 57:39.276
Agh!

57:43.239 --> 57:44.448
Get out of that truck!

57:50.288 --> 57:51.330
( bleeping )

58:05.303 --> 58:06.386
( shouting )

58:06.513 --> 58:08.555
( explosion )

58:23.530 --> 58:25.489
You're inside my head.

58:25.615 --> 58:30.077
You want me to do what you made
the rest of my family do. No!

58:33.248 --> 58:34.581
( screams )

58:34.707 --> 58:35.999
( screaming )

58:39.337 --> 58:40.837
( screams )

58:41.381 --> 58:43.340
No!

58:45.176 --> 58:47.094
( screams )

58:48.555 --> 58:50.639
Aarrgghhh!

58:57.522 --> 58:59.565
( squelching )

59:12.036 --> 59:14.246
Grab on! Grab my hands, Jason.

59:14.372 --> 59:16.790
That's it. I got you now. Come on.

59:16.916 --> 59:18.834
Moe, what took you so long?

59:23.715 --> 59:26.883
NICOLE: That Stuff won't stay buried
for long. They'll dig it out again.

59:27.468 --> 59:29.428
( siren wails )

59:30.597 --> 59:32.097
( hose end jangling )

59:32.223 --> 59:34.725
Oh, boy! I never thought
I'd be glad to see cops!

59:34.851 --> 59:38.353
They control the area, don't you
think they control the police, too?

59:38.479 --> 59:42.357
The whole damn quarry was full
of police. They're all Stuffies.

59:50.199 --> 59:52.075
( siren stops )

59:56.456 --> 59:59.833
Hey! Your hose is hanging out
back there.

01:00:00.543 --> 01:00:03.587
Are you gonna arrest me
for indecent exposure?

01:00:03.713 --> 01:00:06.882
Get your hands up where I can
see 'em and come out of the truck.

01:00:08.718 --> 01:00:10.677
Get over there. Put your hands up.

01:00:12.889 --> 01:00:14.431
Go ahead.

01:00:14.557 --> 01:00:19.394
Do I have to put my hands up, too?
Aren't you gonna shake me down?

01:00:20.104 --> 01:00:22.814
Okay, miss. You come down
out of the truck, too.

01:00:32.075 --> 01:00:36.328
We've sprung a leak. It's a shame
all that Stuff is going to waste.

01:00:41.834 --> 01:00:45.587
- I gotta go get some. Let's get some!
- Officer! I'm so hungry.

01:00:46.422 --> 01:00:51.093
You know how you get hungry if you go
without The Stuff for an hour or two.

01:00:51.219 --> 01:00:53.929
I bet you're hungry too,
aren't you, officer? You're a hungry guy.

01:00:54.055 --> 01:00:57.474
God! I'm so hungry!
Come on, officer.

01:00:59.268 --> 01:01:01.937
( whispers ) Fake eating it.
Officer, it's so good!

01:01:02.063 --> 01:01:04.940
- I'm sure you want some, don't you?
- This is great.

01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:07.317
Mmm, mmm!

01:01:12.865 --> 01:01:14.741
♪ Nothing you like more... ♪

01:01:14.867 --> 01:01:18.245
- JASON: There's a town up ahead!
- I'm gonna bypass it.

01:01:18.371 --> 01:01:21.832
It's too small. They probably control it
and we'd never get out.

01:01:22.875 --> 01:01:25.877
- Then where do we go, David?
- We go to a large city.

01:01:26.003 --> 01:01:27.379
They can't control it.
We have a chance.

01:01:38.099 --> 01:01:40.726
JASON: A castle?
MOE: I know the man who lives here.

01:01:40.852 --> 01:01:43.729
I know everything about him,
only he doesn't know me.

01:01:49.152 --> 01:01:50.569
Wait here.

01:02:08.171 --> 01:02:09.963
( violent yelling )

01:02:18.598 --> 01:02:20.515
I am reporting to Colonel Spears.

01:02:28.608 --> 01:02:30.692
Who are you?

01:02:30.818 --> 01:02:33.653
Well, I once worked for a man
named Hoover.

01:02:34.822 --> 01:02:38.408
And he once ordered me to put
some taps on an apartment

01:02:38.534 --> 01:02:42.954
that you rented for, uh...
a 17-year-old black chick.

01:02:44.373 --> 01:02:46.625
And I wish I'd brought along
the tapes

01:02:46.751 --> 01:02:49.503
because I could prove to you
I really am who I am.

01:02:49.629 --> 01:02:53.673
- You're not with the Bureau any more?
- Oh, no! They canned me.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.718
Just before they mailed those tapes
to your wife.

01:03:00.139 --> 01:03:02.557
I could toss you off this tower.

01:03:02.683 --> 01:03:04.684
You'd land right about there.

01:03:05.561 --> 01:03:07.646
You're a trespasser.

01:03:07.772 --> 01:03:11.733
Oh, Colonel, I only told you about
the tapes so I could get to see you.

01:03:11.859 --> 01:03:13.527
'Cause I need you.

01:03:14.111 --> 01:03:17.155
You know that the whole country
needs you?

01:03:19.283 --> 01:03:22.536
You wouldn’t be tryin' to deceive me
or entrap me?

01:03:22.662 --> 01:03:25.330
Do...do you remember
you were worried

01:03:25.456 --> 01:03:28.500
about the commies
putting fluoride in our water system?

01:03:28.626 --> 01:03:29.918
Mm-hm.

01:03:30.044 --> 01:03:33.630
You know, there's a thing goin' on
now that's a lot worse?

01:03:34.674 --> 01:03:37.759
Americans are being poisoned faster
than you can imagine.

01:03:37.885 --> 01:03:39.594
- Poisoned?
- Yeah.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:44.474
The FBI are always worried about
commies getting deep-cover agents

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:47.811
and putting them into high positions
in American industry.

01:03:47.937 --> 01:03:50.814
Then they'd acquire a corporation,
right?

01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:54.860
And then they'd establish themselves
and they'd work on us

01:03:54.986 --> 01:03:57.612
( whispering ) ...from within,
right inside it.

01:03:57.738 --> 01:04:00.699
Inside, get us from the inside,
get it?

01:04:00.825 --> 01:04:04.286
Sounds like one of my radio speeches
a year ago last Thanksgiving.

01:04:04.412 --> 01:04:06.413
You were a deep prophet.

01:04:06.539 --> 01:04:08.748
A product is being sold now

01:04:08.875 --> 01:04:12.377
and is being consumed
by tens of millions of people,

01:04:12.503 --> 01:04:15.672
and it contains
a mind-affecting drug.

01:04:16.591 --> 01:04:19.509
And you and I both know
who they are.

01:04:20.428 --> 01:04:22.929
- And they're doin' it?
- Oh, yeah.

01:04:23.055 --> 01:04:25.432
Their headquarters
are less than 100 miles from here.

01:04:26.559 --> 01:04:30.103
Sons-of-bitches!
They're flaunting it at me!

01:04:30.229 --> 01:04:32.981
I guess they forgot
about Colonel Spears, huh?

01:04:33.107 --> 01:04:35.066
They didn't know you were around,

01:04:35.192 --> 01:04:37.277
that you could bring them
to their knees!

01:04:37.403 --> 01:04:38.904
Hmm!

01:04:41.324 --> 01:04:44.826
Come with me. We're gonna have
a nice tall cool drink.

01:04:45.828 --> 01:04:48.246
You in the army or something?

01:04:48.372 --> 01:04:50.624
We are your only army, son.

01:04:52.668 --> 01:04:55.587
So, this is the young lady
who's gonna go with us?

01:04:55.713 --> 01:04:59.633
She's familiar with the plant.
You can ride up with me.

01:04:59.759 --> 01:05:02.344
Well, that's gonna really be
an honor, Colonel.

01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:06.598
I know, and after this mission,
you can reward me in a suitable fashion.

01:05:06.724 --> 01:05:09.935
Oh, uh, Colonel.
I think you're movin' in on my lady.

01:05:10.061 --> 01:05:14.022
I wouldn’t worry about that, son.
You'll probably be a casualty.

01:05:23.282 --> 01:05:25.492
You know that missing truck?

01:05:25.618 --> 01:05:28.119
I see it coming down the road
right now.

01:05:29.705 --> 01:05:31.957
No, I can't see who's at the wheel.

01:05:40.174 --> 01:05:42.008
Hey!

01:05:42.134 --> 01:05:45.553
I found this here truck
down by Highway 12, abandoned.

01:05:48.724 --> 01:05:50.392
Kind of figured you might, uh...

01:05:50.518 --> 01:05:54.187
give us some kind of cash reward
for bringing it back.

01:05:55.731 --> 01:05:57.941
Yeah, okay. Move it on in.

01:06:02.905 --> 01:06:05.031
( gate rattles )

01:06:07.368 --> 01:06:09.786
Well, c'mon! Move it on in!

01:06:12.123 --> 01:06:14.916
- Not till we talk about money.
- It's all settled.

01:06:15.042 --> 01:06:16.209
( gunshot )

01:06:16.335 --> 01:06:18.461
( rapid gunfire )

01:06:19.755 --> 01:06:23.425
I kinda like the sight of blood,
but this is disgusting.

01:06:23.551 --> 01:06:25.135
( yelling )

01:06:39.275 --> 01:06:41.151
MAN ON PA: <i>Attention! The main gate
has been penetrated.</i>

01:06:41.277 --> 01:06:44.487
<i>Outsiders are entering the factory.
Do not resist them.</i>

01:06:44.613 --> 01:06:46.489
<i>Follow the agreed upon
course of action.</i>

01:06:46.615 --> 01:06:48.950
<i>Repeat. Follow the agreed
upon course of action.</i>

01:06:54.623 --> 01:06:57.625
Where the hell are the yellow-bellied
sons-of-bitches Stuffies?

01:06:57.752 --> 01:07:00.962
Get back! C'mon!
Check out behind that truck.

01:07:01.088 --> 01:07:03.798
Get some men up on that tower. Now!

01:07:09.764 --> 01:07:11.681
C'mon, you Stuffies sons-of-bitches!

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.434
That's right, Colonel. You tell 'em!

01:07:25.905 --> 01:07:28.073
Let's go have a look inside, guys.

01:07:28.199 --> 01:07:30.575
( rapid gunfire )

01:07:38.042 --> 01:07:41.169
- No show of resistance.
- They may not be armed, sir.

01:07:41.295 --> 01:07:45.673
Doesn't matter if they are. There is
no match for the American boy.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:48.927
- We have never lost a war.
- What about 'Nam, sir?

01:07:49.637 --> 01:07:52.555
We lost that war at home, sonny.

01:07:52.681 --> 01:07:54.390
They may have run out on us.

01:08:00.022 --> 01:08:02.982
( gasps )
Don't look. Don't look.

01:08:04.527 --> 01:08:06.945
The yellow sons-of-bitches.

01:08:07.071 --> 01:08:10.406
They took their own lives.
Commie bastards! You cheated me.

01:08:12.743 --> 01:08:14.786
Still warm.
This must have just happened.

01:08:15.663 --> 01:08:18.747
Must have issued suicide capsules,
ready for us.

01:08:18.874 --> 01:08:22.669
Standard KGB procedure.
FBI, you ever seen anything like this?

01:08:25.506 --> 01:08:26.421
( gasps )

01:08:26.549 --> 01:08:29.134
No white stuff
in this son-of-a-bitch!

01:08:29.593 --> 01:08:33.263
Whatever was inside of them
must have just taken off.

01:08:35.474 --> 01:08:38.935
- I want to see this.
- No, we have to go outside.

01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:42.229
You have to protect the young lady,
trooper.

01:08:45.317 --> 01:08:49.069
- How do you get out of here?
- Down to the end, take a left.

01:08:52.658 --> 01:08:55.076
Come over here, boy.
C'mon, move!

01:08:55.618 --> 01:08:58.412
With these guns
you've got in your hands,

01:08:58.538 --> 01:09:00.665
you think you can shoot anything
you don't like?

01:09:00.791 --> 01:09:05.795
What if what you don't like is inside you?
How you gonna shoot it?

01:09:06.337 --> 01:09:08.006
( rumbling )

01:09:11.301 --> 01:09:12.635
( screams ) No!

01:09:25.524 --> 01:09:28.526
Go faster, Nicole.
Hurry up! Move!

01:09:35.075 --> 01:09:37.202
We've got to make it
through that door. Come on!

01:09:37.745 --> 01:09:39.037
Oh, yeah!

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:42.122
NICOLE: One...two...three!

01:09:52.509 --> 01:09:54.051
Look out! Don't get any of it on you!

01:09:55.554 --> 01:09:57.180
( screaming )

01:10:12.947 --> 01:10:15.573
All right, we're gonna leave it
where it is.

01:10:16.867 --> 01:10:19.202
I own two radio stations in Atlanta.

01:10:19.328 --> 01:10:22.664
We're gonna fly down there.
We're gonna broadcast a warning.

01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:25.291
We're gonna tell the public
what this Stuff can do.

01:10:33.133 --> 01:10:35.843
COLONEL: 75, 80, 90% of the people
in this world don't like me.

01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:39.389
- No?
- I give my body, I give my soul.

01:10:39.515 --> 01:10:42.642
- And they still don't like you?
- They never have liked me.

01:10:42.768 --> 01:10:46.813
When I was a boy, I was the toughest
and smartest and best-looking.

01:10:46.939 --> 01:10:50.692
They want someone lily-livered
and weak and spineless, like they are.

01:10:50.818 --> 01:10:52.986
Ain't that right, FBI?

01:10:53.487 --> 01:10:57.448
So, anyway, is there something
you can do to change my image?

01:10:57.574 --> 01:11:00.827
Colonel, I think she can change
your image like that!

01:11:00.953 --> 01:11:04.163
You sold them that white shit.
Why can't you sell 'em me?

01:11:13.048 --> 01:11:16.968
Come on, gorgeous! I should'a taken
you into combat years ago.

01:11:19.388 --> 01:11:21.389
( yelling )

01:11:29.565 --> 01:11:31.899
What is this, World War III?

01:11:32.026 --> 01:11:36.029
Just get us to 4th and Main
and no more of your liberal remarks.

01:12:15.235 --> 01:12:17.236
( women screaming )

01:12:17.988 --> 01:12:20.573
MAN: Where are they going
with machine guns?

01:12:27.915 --> 01:12:29.665
( yelling )

01:12:31.001 --> 01:12:33.753
Pay the drivers. Issue a 10% tip.

01:12:33.879 --> 01:12:36.005
- Get a cash receipt.
- Yes, sir!

01:12:36.131 --> 01:12:38.216
Proceed to the lobby.
We will reassemble. Hup!

01:12:39.551 --> 01:12:40.718
Report!

01:12:40.844 --> 01:12:43.262
Sir, our affiliates in Florida
and Memphis

01:12:43.389 --> 01:12:45.348
have agreed to carry your remarks
in full.

01:12:45.474 --> 01:12:47.850
Buy clearances on as many stations
as you can.

01:12:47.976 --> 01:12:50.895
Try the network affiliates.
Make it worth their while.

01:12:51.021 --> 01:12:54.649
- What's on our station now?
- Local sports then a tribute to Elvis.

01:12:54.775 --> 01:12:57.110
♪ Can't get enough of The Stuff! ♪♪

01:12:57.236 --> 01:12:59.987
<i>The stuff. The taste that makes
you hungry for more!</i>

01:13:00.114 --> 01:13:02.740
- Get that shit off my station!
- ( turns radio off )

01:13:04.576 --> 01:13:06.327
Get it off!

01:13:10.332 --> 01:13:12.708
- You can't write this.
- What?

01:13:12.835 --> 01:13:16.254
Well, you say that you're partly
responsible for the whole thing

01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:19.215
and that you promoted
reckless advertising.

01:13:19.341 --> 01:13:22.885
- It's the truth, isn't it?
- You want to wreck your career?

01:13:23.011 --> 01:13:26.222
You can be idealistic,
but don't be stupid. This is...

01:13:26.348 --> 01:13:28.433
I thought I'd let you support me
for a while.

01:13:28.559 --> 01:13:32.687
- <i>Support you?</i>
- <i>Yeah. You do make money.</i>

01:13:32.813 --> 01:13:35.481
Yeah, well,
when I blackmail people, I do.

01:13:35.607 --> 01:13:39.694
Get these Stormtroopers out of my way
before I lay them all to waste!

01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:43.656
Get out the way! Don't you know
who I am? I am Chocolate Chip Charlie.

01:13:43.782 --> 01:13:47.201
My hands are registered with the Midland
Georgia police as lethal weapons

01:13:47.327 --> 01:13:49.495
and I eat them guns for breakfast.

01:13:51.707 --> 01:13:55.918
"The American people are being
poisoned by a popular dessert product

01:13:56.044 --> 01:13:58.045
"known as The Stuff.

01:13:58.172 --> 01:14:01.215
"If you have this food in your possession,
do not eat it." Good.

01:14:01.341 --> 01:14:04.260
"If you are a merchant and you..."
What is that?

01:14:04.386 --> 01:14:06.471
That's "do not sell it".

01:14:06.597 --> 01:14:09.098
Get! Get! Just get out of it!

01:14:09.224 --> 01:14:13.436
- He's all right. Charlie, how are you?
- How are you doing, David, my man?

01:14:13.562 --> 01:14:14.854
Hey, David, man.

01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:18.524
They tried to get to me,
but I punched a lot of holes in them.

01:14:18.650 --> 01:14:21.569
- How did you find us?
- You got time for a long story?

01:14:21.695 --> 01:14:24.447
No, I don't, but I never did hear
from the FBI.

01:14:24.573 --> 01:14:26.824
You are not gonna do a program

01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:29.452
without the participation
of Chocolate Chip Charlie.

01:14:29.578 --> 01:14:33.289
They stole my company, man.
I got a right to be heard.

01:14:33.415 --> 01:14:35.416
That's a great idea.

01:14:35.542 --> 01:14:39.212
Course, they might figure I'm lying,
trying to knock the competition.

01:14:39.338 --> 01:14:42.423
Often it's easier to believe lies
than the truth.

01:14:42.549 --> 01:14:44.842
Charlie, you are really welcome.

01:14:44.968 --> 01:14:49.805
- I'm Nicole, queen of the ex liars.
- Eight minutes to air. Who is this?

01:14:49.932 --> 01:14:52.850
- He's on the broadcast.
- Not on my station.

01:14:52.976 --> 01:14:55.978
Hey, are you really
Chocolate Chip Charlie?

01:14:56.104 --> 01:14:58.606
It's nice to see that somebody
still likes me.

01:14:58.732 --> 01:15:02.985
I am just plain old Charlie W Hobbs,
who wants to make a statement.

01:15:03.111 --> 01:15:05.613
You are not going to keep me off
those microphones,

01:15:05.739 --> 01:15:08.407
even with your stooges
in the funny costumes.

01:15:08.534 --> 01:15:12.245
Do you realize how many people love
Charlie as much as Jason does?

01:15:12.371 --> 01:15:15.331
- 20 million!
- 20 million people.

01:15:15.457 --> 01:15:17.208
In advertising money,
how much is that?

01:15:17.918 --> 01:15:19.835
An extra 20,000 a minute, probably.

01:15:19.962 --> 01:15:23.422
If you wanna throw away
all that money, go right ahead.

01:15:23.549 --> 01:15:26.259
I will permit this colored man
to speak.

01:15:27.302 --> 01:15:30.596
But speak one word
of the Commie Party line

01:15:30.722 --> 01:15:34.600
or one word in code,
and I will blow his head off.

01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:39.522
Look, can I go somewhere
to get my thoughts organized?

01:15:39.648 --> 01:15:42.358
We'll get the plot outlined
and be back in a minute.

01:15:42.484 --> 01:15:46.279
We don't have a lot of time,
so are you prepared to say on air

01:15:46.405 --> 01:15:49.115
that you've seen people
devoured by The Stuff?

01:15:49.241 --> 01:15:54.287
Hell, yes! And I've seen what's left of
them when The Stuff comes back out.

01:15:57.666 --> 01:15:59.625
You want to run that by me again?

01:15:59.751 --> 01:16:03.379
I've seen what's left when it gets
through with them and comes back out.

01:16:03.505 --> 01:16:06.549
It sort of vacates the premises
when it's through.

01:16:06.675 --> 01:16:08.509
How?

01:16:09.761 --> 01:16:13.889
I'm sorry. What am I asking you for?
How would you know?

01:16:14.558 --> 01:16:16.225
Oh, I know!

01:16:17.269 --> 01:16:18.978
Charlie.

01:16:21.023 --> 01:16:22.773
Charlie, are you all right?

01:16:22.899 --> 01:16:25.443
Charlie, are you all right?
What's the matter?

01:16:26.069 --> 01:16:27.903
( groaning )

01:16:31.158 --> 01:16:33.075
Charlie! Let go!

01:16:34.411 --> 01:16:38.581
( screams )

01:16:38.707 --> 01:16:40.750
Oh, God! Charlie!

01:16:49.968 --> 01:16:51.636
( screams )

01:16:54.389 --> 01:16:56.724
Jason, don't move.
Don't let it touch you.

01:16:58.393 --> 01:17:00.061
( both scream )

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:03.272
NICOLE: Moe!

01:17:03.398 --> 01:17:04.982
Help!

01:17:07.027 --> 01:17:08.569
( inaudible )

01:17:08.695 --> 01:17:10.655
- Moe, help us!
- Help!

01:17:13.033 --> 01:17:15.368
NICOLE: Oh, God! It's growing!

01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:18.037
( screams )

01:17:23.126 --> 01:17:24.669
Hit the juice!

01:17:27.297 --> 01:17:29.006
Hit it!

01:17:33.762 --> 01:17:36.138
Get the girl out! Get the kid out!

01:17:36.264 --> 01:17:38.724
I'm coming. Come on, Jason.

01:17:45.107 --> 01:17:46.982
( Nicole groaning ) Oh, no!

01:17:47.109 --> 01:17:49.527
It was slithering!

01:17:56.576 --> 01:17:58.703
30 seconds, sir. Should we delay?

01:17:58.829 --> 01:18:00.705
No. We'll never get
the clearances again.

01:18:00.831 --> 01:18:03.332
( beeping )

01:18:04.084 --> 01:18:06.419
ANNOUNCER: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,
from Atlanta, Georgia,</i>

01:18:06.545 --> 01:18:08.713
<i>this is a broadcast of warning.</i>

01:18:08.839 --> 01:18:12.508
<i>This is not fiction.
This is not a dramatization.</i>

01:18:15.053 --> 01:18:17.012
My fellow Americans.

01:18:17.139 --> 01:18:19.348
This is Colonel Malcolm
Grommett Spears.

01:18:19.474 --> 01:18:22.435
I have never misled you
and I will never mislead you.

01:18:22.561 --> 01:18:25.271
Tonight, America is in grave danger.

01:18:25.397 --> 01:18:29.316
We are under alien attack by
a substance which represents itself

01:18:29.443 --> 01:18:31.861
as a popular dessert
known as The Stuff.

01:18:31.987 --> 01:18:34.363
If The Stuff is in your house,
do not eat it.

01:18:34.489 --> 01:18:36.574
Repeat, I mark you, do not eat it!

01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:39.702
If you are a merchant and have it
on your shelves, do not sell it!

01:18:39.828 --> 01:18:42.997
If you have a distributorship
and you distribute this material,

01:18:43.123 --> 01:18:45.082
close your doors,
make no more sales.

01:18:45.208 --> 01:18:48.335
If a member of your family
is dependent on this product,

01:18:48.462 --> 01:18:50.171
get them to a hospital.

01:18:50.297 --> 01:18:53.758
If you have this product in your home,
cook it. I repeat, cook it.

01:19:00.015 --> 01:19:01.891
And the people did believe.

01:19:02.017 --> 01:19:05.227
In the weeks that followed, The Stuff
was withdrawn from distribution.

01:19:05.353 --> 01:19:08.230
The nation mobilized to collect it
and destroy it.

01:19:10.150 --> 01:19:13.611
REPORTER: <i>Violent action has been
taken against the stores and franchises</i>

01:19:13.737 --> 01:19:15.446
<i>that carried The Stuff.</i>

01:19:15.572 --> 01:19:18.115
<i>Local authorities cautioned
the public to remain calm.</i>

01:19:18.241 --> 01:19:19.825
<i>Upon reports
that the product was toxic,</i>

01:19:19.951 --> 01:19:22.870
<i>public health officials visited
the quarry in Midland, Georgia,</i>

01:19:22.996 --> 01:19:25.372
<i>only to find it buried
in a mass of rubble...</i>

01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:48.562
<i>...more at 11.</i>

01:19:49.231 --> 01:19:51.857
Although the casualties were
in the thousands

01:19:51.983 --> 01:19:54.944
American industry has worked
with full government support

01:19:55.904 --> 01:19:57.905
<i>to save millions of other lives</i>

01:19:58.031 --> 01:20:01.534
<i>and to compensate the injured
for their tragic losses.</i>

01:20:02.619 --> 01:20:05.287
<i>I am reading these words
off a teleprompter</i>

01:20:05.413 --> 01:20:07.373
because I...

01:20:08.124 --> 01:20:10.209
I simply didn't know what to say.

01:20:10.335 --> 01:20:12.962
The fact of the matter is that...

01:20:13.088 --> 01:20:16.006
I'm selling you an apology.

01:20:18.051 --> 01:20:19.844
I'm sorry.

01:20:24.182 --> 01:20:26.141
She is a pretty thing, isn't she?

01:20:26.268 --> 01:20:27.935
Well!

01:20:28.562 --> 01:20:31.856
Well, are you here to throw my money
back in my face?

01:20:31.982 --> 01:20:34.525
- Uh, no. I spent it.
- Hm.

01:20:35.277 --> 01:20:38.612
You think by dynamiting one quarry
you could shut us down for ever?

01:20:38.738 --> 01:20:41.782
You realize that stuff seeps up
through the Earth any place?

01:20:41.908 --> 01:20:44.743
Well, I guess we'll just find
those places.

01:20:45.829 --> 01:20:49.498
I'm afraid I'm not alone tonight,
Moe.

01:20:49.624 --> 01:20:53.127
I suppose you've spent my money
as well, eh?

01:20:53.795 --> 01:20:57.965
- You two are in business together!
- It was inevitable, wasn't it?

01:20:58.091 --> 01:21:01.844
The Stuff is finished, of course,
but look here.

01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:05.264
Look at the new campaign
for The Taste.

01:21:08.268 --> 01:21:12.688
Only 12% of The Stuff in it. Just enough
to make the public crave for more.

01:21:12.814 --> 01:21:15.733
And the balance is natural
dairy products.

01:21:15.859 --> 01:21:20.154
There won't be enough of The Stuff
in it to get a grip on anybody's mind.

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:23.532
- How do you know?
- Well, we tested it.

01:21:23.658 --> 01:21:25.659
We tested it
in a small Illinois town.

01:21:25.785 --> 01:21:27.703
If you tested it, you can taste it.

01:21:28.288 --> 01:21:29.872
Oh! You go too far.

01:21:29.998 --> 01:21:34.084
I didn't come alone here, either.
I brought along a couple of friends.

01:21:34.210 --> 01:21:35.920
Jason!

01:21:39.382 --> 01:21:42.760
- This is no place for a kid, Moe.
- Oh, he ain't a kid any more.

01:21:42.886 --> 01:21:45.554
The Stuff took away his parents
and took away his brother.

01:21:46.431 --> 01:21:48.891
- You brought another friend?
- Yup.

01:21:49.017 --> 01:21:50.225
Him.

01:21:50.769 --> 01:21:55.105
Now, put that away. You wouldn’t
use it in front of the boy.

01:21:55.231 --> 01:21:58.108
Like he said,
I've been through a lot.

01:21:58.610 --> 01:22:02.196
Well, you sit right down.
Go on, have yourself a seat.

01:22:02.322 --> 01:22:04.573
We're gonna have a little dinner.

01:22:04.699 --> 01:22:06.325
Jason?

01:22:06.451 --> 01:22:09.870
- Serve the gentlemen.
- A pleasure.

01:22:12.248 --> 01:22:14.333
You recognize that, don't you?

01:22:18.088 --> 01:22:19.713
No. Wait...

01:22:19.839 --> 01:22:23.384
Make a big old mountain of it
right in front of them.

01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:27.388
- Here.
- Yes, pass it right on down.

01:22:27.514 --> 01:22:30.891
- Dig in yourself.
- Look! I had nothing to do with it.

01:22:33.228 --> 01:22:35.479
You see this hole here?

01:22:35.605 --> 01:22:37.815
It's getting bigger and bigger,
isn't it?

01:22:38.858 --> 01:22:42.069
So you'd better eat that
or you're gonna eat this.

01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:44.738
- Eat it!
- How much of it?

01:22:44.864 --> 01:22:47.783
You eat as much of it as I want you
to eat, until I tell you to stop.

01:22:47.909 --> 01:22:49.743
Till it's comin' outta your eyeballs.

01:22:54.207 --> 01:22:57.126
- Eat it.
- You, too, partner.

01:22:59.129 --> 01:23:00.587
Eat it!

01:23:02.841 --> 01:23:04.383
Mm. Mmm.

01:23:09.055 --> 01:23:11.682
Are you eatin' it?
Or is it eatin' you?

01:23:26.072 --> 01:23:28.032
( sirens approaching )

01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:31.618
JASON: Here they come.
Right on schedule.

01:23:35.749 --> 01:23:37.458
I guess we did it, Moe.

01:26:27.879 --> 01:26:29.379
Enough is never enough.
