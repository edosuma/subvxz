00:01.269 --> 00:04.308
-Previously on The Resident...
-Just an email Ian forwarded me.

00:04.375 --> 00:05.512
How is everything with him?

00:05.612 --> 00:08.684
<i>CADE:</i>
<i>Passed his drug test.</i>
<i>Operating up a storm...</i>

00:08.751 --> 00:10.387
Fine, I guess.

00:11.055 --> 00:12.592
Seems crazy.

00:12.692 --> 00:14.462
But we all cover up things
we don't want to see.

00:14.530 --> 00:15.732
The longer we look away,

00:15.832 --> 00:19.071
the harder it gets to see
what's right before our eyes.

00:21.209 --> 00:23.046
KIT:
I know what will make me smile.

00:23.113 --> 00:25.083
Showing you photos
of the exquisite venue

00:25.150 --> 00:26.754
where in a few short weeks,

00:26.820 --> 00:29.025
I will marry
the man of my dreams.

00:53.273 --> 00:55.010
KIT:
Sorry, everyone.

00:55.077 --> 00:56.947
It's the governor's office.
I have to take this.

00:57.014 --> 00:58.751
Okay, let's, uh,
just give her a minute.

00:58.851 --> 01:02.057
(sighs) Sure, yeah.
Let's, uh, let's all take five.

01:02.124 --> 01:05.665
Daddy, when's Sammie
gonna be here?

01:05.798 --> 01:07.101
She and Jake are on their way.

01:07.167 --> 01:08.671
And they're bringing
your flower girl dresses

01:08.738 --> 01:11.242
for the ceremony tonight,
isn't that exciting?

01:11.342 --> 01:12.278
Yeah!

01:12.344 --> 01:14.983
So, when is he available?

01:15.050 --> 01:17.589
Well, I certainly hope so.
Thank you.

01:17.689 --> 01:18.791
Everything all right?

01:18.858 --> 01:21.029
Our new governor's been
avoiding my calls all week

01:21.095 --> 01:23.066
and now his office
won't even set a meeting.

01:23.199 --> 01:25.404
He's probably too busy
making plans to slash funding

01:25.505 --> 01:26.874
for public hospitals
like Chastain.

01:27.007 --> 01:29.178
And it'll be hard to change
his mind if he keeps dodging me.

01:29.245 --> 01:33.053
I know you're worried,
but we'll figure it out.

01:33.119 --> 01:34.690
Just not today.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.259
I know we will.

01:36.326 --> 01:39.031

spoil this evening.

01:43.941 --> 01:45.377
Oh, it's lovely to see you.

01:45.477 --> 01:47.448
I'm just sorry Gregg
couldn't make it.

01:47.549 --> 01:49.018
-Yeah.
-BELL: Glad you could make it.

Oh, no.

01:54.161 --> 01:55.798
Our dresses were in them.

01:55.898 --> 01:59.138
-But I want to be a flower girl.
-CONRAD: That's okay,

-BILLIE: Oh, sweetie.

02:01.309 --> 02:03.146
It's Tracy Laybourne.

I believe God created
voice mail for times like this.

02:07.321 --> 02:08.658
Tracy, good morning.

02:08.724 --> 02:12.197
Ms. Laybourne is a tech mogul
from Silicon Valley,

02:12.297 --> 02:13.634
and one of the few
prospective donors

02:13.701 --> 02:15.672

<i>I'm glad you picked up.</i>

02:17.542 --> 02:19.078
I thought you might
be in surgery.

02:19.145 --> 02:22.151
Actually, uh,
I took the day off.

02:22.251 --> 02:23.453
Is everything okay?

02:24.255 --> 02:25.658
It's my daughter.

02:25.725 --> 02:26.894
She's not feeling well.

02:26.994 --> 02:29.666
Okay, uh,
tell me what's going on.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.904
Well, we were on our way
to the aquarium

02:31.970 --> 02:33.340
and Max started feeling

02:33.406 --> 02:35.645
sluggish and sweaty.

02:35.745 --> 02:36.947

02:40.120 --> 02:42.391
-I know in Atlanta.
-Okay, sounds as though

02:42.458 --> 02:44.161
she needs an internist.
I can

02:44.228 --> 02:46.600
send our best to meet you
at Chastain ER

02:46.667 --> 02:48.738
and I'll be there
as soon as I can.

02:48.771 --> 02:50.474
Thanks.

03:12.451 --> 03:14.823
Conrad, can you take a look
at Tracy's daughter?

03:14.856 --> 03:17.796
-I-I could, but I...
-Go. I'll watch Gigi.

03:17.862 --> 03:19.966
-I mean, I took the day off.
-Uh, the girls

03:20.067 --> 03:21.670
do need new flower girl dresses

03:21.737 --> 03:22.672
and I need a new suit.

03:22.706 --> 03:24.810
Great. So we'll divide
and conquer.

03:24.876 --> 03:26.112
You go get your suit

03:26.179 --> 03:27.816
and I'll take
our little ladies shopping.

03:27.849 --> 03:29.385
Meet back here.

03:29.485 --> 03:30.755
You don't have to do this.

03:30.788 --> 03:31.924
I can get a sitter.

03:32.024 --> 03:33.794
Are you kidding me?
It'll be fun.

03:34.563 --> 03:36.533
Shouldn't we finish
the rehearsal?

03:36.600 --> 03:39.371
Oh, thank you, Lindsay,
but Randolph and I already have

03:39.405 --> 03:41.977
a few weddings between us,
so I think we're good.

03:42.044 --> 03:43.246
I'll get him back in one piece.

You, not so fast.

and they're off the charts.

06:28.409 --> 06:29.679
How high are we talking?

06:29.813 --> 06:32.284
So high the lab
ran them three times.

06:32.351 --> 06:33.721
Her INR is 2.0.

06:34.623 --> 06:35.791
She's going into liver failure.

06:35.858 --> 06:39.265
And fast.
We need to move faster.

06:39.331 --> 06:40.635
All right, I'll talk with Tracy

If we can't figure out the cause
and reverse it fast enough,

06:46.379 --> 06:50.086
-there's only one thing
that will keep Max alive.
-Transplant.

06:56.867 --> 06:58.136
Wait...

06:58.236 --> 07:00.808
-my daughter may need
a liver transplant?
-I'm...

07:00.875 --> 07:03.179
I'm sorry.
I wish we had better news.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.920
Come on, honey.
Let's go.

07:06.987 --> 07:09.158
-Take that thing out.
We're getting out of here.
-We need to get her

07:09.224 --> 07:11.997
to the ICU right away to monitor
her labs and mental status.

07:12.097 --> 07:14.234
That's the only way to know
how fast her liver is worsening.

07:14.335 --> 07:17.909
You know what, no offense, but I
brought Max here for a checkup,

07:17.976 --> 07:19.178
not a transplant.

07:19.244 --> 07:21.315
We both know that this hospital
is in financial trouble

07:21.415 --> 07:23.787
and that's why
you reached out to me.

07:26.359 --> 07:27.895
-I'll explain in the car.
-Tracy,

07:27.962 --> 07:30.033
I would strongly advise
against moving her.

07:30.100 --> 07:33.607
This has nothing to do
with you helping Chastain.

07:33.674 --> 07:35.410
Max is critically ill.

07:35.477 --> 07:37.682
Her condition could change
at any moment

07:37.749 --> 07:40.086
and moving her in this state
is a risk I would not recommend.

07:40.186 --> 07:42.357
TRACY:
Okay, right.

07:42.424 --> 07:43.493
Listen.

07:43.560 --> 07:47.067
My daughter was born
with her hearing.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.071
But at six months old
she got an infection

07:49.138 --> 07:52.344
and the hospital I took her to
was wildly underfunded.

07:52.377 --> 07:54.014
They sent her home
with an antibiotic

07:54.081 --> 07:58.089
and completely missed the fact
that she had meningitis.

07:58.189 --> 07:59.726
That's how Max lost her hearing.

07:59.793 --> 08:00.928
Yes.

08:01.028 --> 08:03.232
I donate to hospitals
like Chastain

08:03.333 --> 08:05.938
because they need the help.

08:06.005 --> 08:09.078
But I won't let my daughter
get harmed again.

08:09.111 --> 08:10.548
(phone chimes)

08:11.516 --> 08:13.954
And I just had my assistant
get the number

08:14.021 --> 08:16.392
of the best pediatric surgeon
in the country.

08:16.459 --> 08:18.931
All right. Let's go, honey.

08:19.031 --> 08:21.202
And we've no idea
what caused this?

08:21.302 --> 08:22.805
Not acetaminophen, I checked.

08:22.872 --> 08:24.943
You started her on NAC,
to be safe?

08:25.010 --> 08:27.180
And a battery of tests.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.318
My daughter deserves the best
and that's exactly

08:29.385 --> 08:30.988
-who she'll be seeing.
-What's the deal?

08:31.055 --> 08:33.192
-(phone rings)
-BELL: We've got a problem.

08:33.259 --> 08:36.566
Hello, this is Dr. Sullivan.

08:38.136 --> 08:40.508
Hello?

08:41.442 --> 08:42.879
You're here.

08:44.749 --> 08:46.052
I am.

08:46.152 --> 08:48.690
But I can't talk right now.

08:48.791 --> 08:52.064
I'm about to meet
my next patient.

08:55.003 --> 08:56.840
Hi.

09:09.465 --> 09:11.202
So what happens now?

09:11.302 --> 09:12.304
Well, first,

09:12.404 --> 09:14.108
you have to trust me.

09:14.174 --> 09:16.045
I do.

09:16.112 --> 09:17.548
And I'm sorry.

09:17.648 --> 09:19.853
-I just...
-There's no apology necessary.

09:19.919 --> 09:21.355
Dr. Sullivan
will keep Max stable

09:21.422 --> 09:23.761
while Dr. Hawkins does his
damnedest to try and figure out

09:23.861 --> 09:25.531
why her liver is failing.

09:25.598 --> 09:26.666
We find the cause,

09:26.733 --> 09:27.869
then maybe we can treat Max

09:27.969 --> 09:29.806
and avoid a transplant
altogether.

09:30.975 --> 09:32.144
Give me the real.

09:32.210 --> 09:35.216
You're not here
because the outlook is positive.

09:36.820 --> 09:39.057
Things don't go our way,
we can list Max with UNOS,

09:39.124 --> 09:42.063
get a liver
from a deceased donor.

09:42.164 --> 09:43.634
But that will take time.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.036
There is another option.

09:45.136 --> 09:47.474
Transplant the lobe
of a living donor.

09:47.575 --> 09:49.411
Someone related to Max who can

09:49.478 --> 09:50.981
give a part of their liver
to her.

09:51.048 --> 09:54.321
So, you could make
a list of relatives,

09:54.388 --> 09:56.091
just in case,
people we can call.

09:56.192 --> 09:57.227
There-There's no one else.

09:57.294 --> 09:59.164
No father in the picture
and I have no siblings.

09:59.198 --> 10:02.505
It has always
just been me and Max.

10:02.572 --> 10:04.308
So if she needs a liver,

10:04.408 --> 10:06.112
I will give her part of mine.

10:07.882 --> 10:10.120
Okay.
I can take you to the lab

10:10.220 --> 10:13.059
and get some blood drawn
to see if you're a match

10:13.126 --> 10:14.261
and walk you through

10:14.328 --> 10:16.365
-next steps on the way.
-Okay.

10:25.718 --> 10:27.287
Portal vessels are patent.

10:27.387 --> 10:29.291
Good flow. No sign of clot.

10:29.358 --> 10:30.828
Which would be a good thing,
but, right now...

10:30.895 --> 10:32.297
We still don't have the cause.

10:32.397 --> 10:34.301
-Viral studies back yet?
-Well,

10:34.401 --> 10:37.942
hep B and C are both negative.

10:43.787 --> 10:46.292
Loss of appetite could indicate
worsening liver failure.

10:46.358 --> 10:48.296
Or it could mean...

10:48.362 --> 10:51.636
You don't like Jell-O?

10:55.376 --> 10:58.750
I always get the "E" wrong.

11:00.186 --> 11:01.990
You know how to sign?

11:02.023 --> 11:03.326
A little.

11:07.935 --> 11:09.806
TRACY:
Hey, sweetie.

11:11.643 --> 11:13.714
How are you feeling?

11:14.916 --> 11:15.951
Mm.

11:17.487 --> 11:20.126
So, we can't go home yet.

11:20.193 --> 11:22.097
Right?

11:22.163 --> 11:23.199
The doctors,

11:23.299 --> 11:25.604
they're gonna try to help me

11:25.671 --> 11:27.240
to help you.

11:32.384 --> 11:34.989
By... letting me

11:35.023 --> 11:38.195
give a part of me to you.

11:42.470 --> 11:44.909
You remember when you had

11:44.976 --> 11:49.184
that Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head?

11:49.318 --> 11:50.320
(chuckles)

11:50.386 --> 11:54.261
And she could give her ears

11:54.328 --> 11:58.436
or her nose to him?

11:58.503 --> 12:01.743
It's kind of like that.

12:07.020 --> 12:11.328
Of course.
I will be fine, sweetie.

12:17.374 --> 12:19.211
Your mom's liver will grow back.

12:19.311 --> 12:20.948
That's pretty cool, huh?

12:39.284 --> 12:41.856
That was pretty impressive
in there.

12:42.558 --> 12:44.394
When did you learn ASL?

12:44.461 --> 12:45.798
I took a class in college.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.167
I don't remember that much,

12:47.200 --> 12:49.471
but I do remember
my favorite was "microwave."

12:49.572 --> 12:50.808
Oh.

12:50.908 --> 12:53.045
Wait. Hold-hold on.

12:53.647 --> 12:58.389
Do these nails match the dress
I saw in the back of your car?

12:58.489 --> 12:59.926
I got them done for tonight.

12:59.959 --> 13:02.397
I thought you said you weren't
a wedding kind of girl.

13:02.531 --> 13:05.370
I... I believe
your words were...

13:05.470 --> 13:07.708
-(scoffs)
-"weddings are
a special kind of torture."

13:07.808 --> 13:10.681
Yes. But I am looking forward
to this one.

13:10.748 --> 13:11.783
(chuckles)

13:11.883 --> 13:13.386
Bell and Kit invited me.

13:13.452 --> 13:15.423
Not just as your plus-one.

13:16.860 --> 13:20.099
Think I'm finally
part of the group.

13:21.803 --> 13:23.573
Means a lot to me.

13:23.640 --> 13:25.143
Me too.

13:25.911 --> 13:27.347
(phone rings)

13:27.447 --> 13:29.117
Don't tell me you've
been tweeting at the governor

13:29.184 --> 13:31.121
-all morning.
-You know me too well.

13:31.188 --> 13:33.694
<i>Full disclosure, I also follow</i>
<i>you on social media</i>

13:33.827 --> 13:35.864
and I saw for myself.
(chuckles)

13:35.964 --> 13:37.267
This-this is how you relax?

13:37.334 --> 13:40.908
Says the man treating patients
on his wedding day.

13:41.543 --> 13:42.945
<i>How's the girl?</i>

13:42.978 --> 13:44.247
She may need a liver transplant,

13:44.381 --> 13:46.051
but we just found out
her mom is a match.

13:46.118 --> 13:48.389
That's great news.
Keep me posted.

13:48.489 --> 13:50.393
Of course.

13:50.460 --> 13:53.967
After this echo,
you should be cleared to donate.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.203
Mm.
(chuckles)

13:55.269 --> 13:56.673
AUSTIN:
Nice ink game, by the way.

13:56.740 --> 13:58.075
(laughs)

13:58.142 --> 14:02.150
Yeah, back in my 20s,
I was big into the music scene.

14:02.250 --> 14:04.054
-And then Max was born.
-Mm.

14:04.121 --> 14:07.427
Now I'm a little... quieter.

14:08.329 --> 14:10.099
She's an amazing kid.

14:10.166 --> 14:12.738
I started my company 'cause
I wanted to give her everything,

14:12.872 --> 14:15.243
and... now I can.

14:15.343 --> 14:18.215
Yeah, well, family
is a powerful motivator.

14:18.282 --> 14:20.386
Mm. Mm.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.135
What is it?

14:28.202 --> 14:30.641
AUSTIN:
The echo is showing signs

14:30.741 --> 14:32.978
of critical aortic stenosis.

14:33.079 --> 14:36.218
It's a severe narrowing
in the valve that brings blood

14:36.285 --> 14:38.890
from your heart to your body.

14:40.326 --> 14:44.301
Uh, I have been
more short of breath lately.

14:44.367 --> 14:45.871
Tiring more easily.

14:45.971 --> 14:49.344
Well, an aortic valve
replacement should fix that.

14:49.411 --> 14:51.048
But it is major.

14:51.148 --> 14:54.421
Your heart is going to need
some time to recover before you

14:54.488 --> 14:57.193
can safely donate
part of your liver.

14:57.293 --> 14:59.364
All right, well, how much time?

14:59.431 --> 15:00.366
Weeks.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.538
Maybe months.

15:02.605 --> 15:05.878
But Dr. Bell said
that Max may need a liver soon.

15:05.944 --> 15:09.585
And I'm saying that
if we attempt a transplant now,

15:09.652 --> 15:11.990
you could die on the table.

15:14.796 --> 15:15.396
No, but...

15:15.463 --> 15:18.970
I have to save my daughter.

15:20.541 --> 15:22.511
I can't live without her.

15:23.412 --> 15:25.116
She's my whole world.

15:25.851 --> 15:29.926
So, we will find another way.

15:38.442 --> 15:40.647
(indistinct chatter)

15:51.669 --> 15:53.372
What did you find out?

15:53.439 --> 15:54.609
CONRAD:
Nothing.

15:54.642 --> 15:57.280
We have no idea
why this kid's liver's failing.

15:57.380 --> 15:59.919
No Kayser-Fleischer rings
in her eyes.

15:59.986 --> 16:01.488
No evidence of Wilson's.

16:01.523 --> 16:03.760
Autoimmune serologies are...
they're pending.

16:03.827 --> 16:06.498
But it's unlikely, and hepatitis
labs came back negative.

16:06.599 --> 16:09.505
Well, we have to hurry,
'cause I just talked to AJ

16:09.539 --> 16:12.243
and Tracy can't donate.

16:15.584 --> 16:17.888
Max's coags are climbing.

16:18.489 --> 16:19.859
She could start
bleeding internally

16:19.959 --> 16:21.629
-at any moment.
-Well, just double down.

16:21.696 --> 16:24.100
Try harder. If you can't figure
out why Max's liver's failing

16:24.201 --> 16:26.171
and we have no donor...

16:28.108 --> 16:30.479
...this child could die.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.769
("Corners"
by Book On Tape Worm playing)

16:45.476 --> 16:46.411
Aunt Billie?

16:46.445 --> 16:48.349
What will you wear
for your wedding?

16:49.150 --> 16:51.355
You know, not everyone
gets married.

16:51.421 --> 16:54.227
If you do,
can we pick your dress?

16:55.296 --> 16:57.768
Is your daddy
gonna get married again?

16:58.603 --> 17:00.206
I don't know.

17:00.273 --> 17:02.945
He has a girlfriend.

17:03.045 --> 17:04.682
Do you like her?

17:05.483 --> 17:06.485
She's okay.

17:06.586 --> 17:07.888
She's not like my mommy.

17:07.955 --> 17:10.459
I mean, I don't
remember my mommy,

17:10.527 --> 17:11.796
but it's different.

17:13.232 --> 17:14.802
I remember your mommy.

17:14.902 --> 17:16.205
She was really nice.

17:16.305 --> 17:18.075
She was a nurse when I was sick.

17:18.142 --> 17:19.612
She took great care of me.

17:19.679 --> 17:22.651
I wish I remembered her.

17:23.753 --> 17:26.091
♪ ♪

17:28.495 --> 17:29.699
There she is.

17:29.765 --> 17:31.936
The woman of the hour.

17:32.003 --> 17:35.276
-I'm not married yet.
-No, but you're trending
on Twitter.

17:35.343 --> 17:38.382
Yeah. Right behind
the latest banana muffin craze

17:38.449 --> 17:41.255
and a bunny dancing
on a bed to the Beatles.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.994
Hey, that bunny is talented.

17:44.094 --> 17:46.532
Governor Betz has got to be
feeling the pressure

17:46.599 --> 17:47.635
to meet with you now.

17:47.735 --> 17:49.237
So far, no word.

17:49.304 --> 17:52.176
But I did get a call
from a local news station.

17:52.243 --> 17:55.249
They want to interview me live
on-air later.

17:55.316 --> 17:58.623
And I'm actually considering it,
on my wedding day.

17:59.424 --> 18:00.761
You're really worried
about this.

18:00.861 --> 18:03.934
If we lose the millions
the governor plans to cut,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.171
Chastain will become
a third-rate hospital,

18:06.238 --> 18:08.175
and I can't stand that.

18:09.277 --> 18:10.514
I wish I could help.

18:10.614 --> 18:12.685
Gregg and I owe so much
to Chastain.

18:12.751 --> 18:16.291
If it wasn't for you and Bell
and all the doctors there,

18:16.358 --> 18:17.828
we wouldn't have Sammie.

18:17.962 --> 18:19.431
I wouldn't have a family.

18:20.634 --> 18:22.437
Oh!

18:22.538 --> 18:23.540
(gasps)

18:23.607 --> 18:24.675
What do you think?

18:24.809 --> 18:26.178
-JAKE: Wow.
-KIT: I love them.

18:26.244 --> 18:27.815
They're perfect.

18:27.915 --> 18:30.621
-Sammie insisted we try on
every dress in Atlanta.
-Mm-hmm.

18:30.687 --> 18:32.992
You know, your daughter
is very persuasive.

18:33.058 --> 18:35.429
Yeah. Who could say no
to that face?

18:38.803 --> 18:40.272
You're right.

18:42.811 --> 18:45.116
Who could say no to that face?

18:49.625 --> 18:51.495
(coughs)

18:51.596 --> 18:53.198
(retches)

18:55.169 --> 18:56.171
When did this start?

18:56.271 --> 18:58.743
A few minutes ago.

18:58.843 --> 19:00.079
I'm ordering blood and plasma.

19:00.146 --> 19:01.983
CADE:
I'll reexamine her belly.
Hang on.

19:02.050 --> 19:04.722
Let just see what's going on.

19:05.590 --> 19:06.893
Mm...

19:06.993 --> 19:08.162
So what's the plan?

19:08.262 --> 19:10.232
Well, for now,
we try and keep her stable

19:10.299 --> 19:12.938
while we hope UNOS
moves her up the donor list.

19:13.038 --> 19:15.777
But that's a long shot,
isn't it?

19:16.646 --> 19:17.581
Tell me the truth.

19:18.315 --> 19:22.725
There's a chance
a liver may not come in time.

19:26.064 --> 19:26.833
No.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.870
But I am here.

19:29.538 --> 19:32.010
I don't care about the risks.

19:32.076 --> 19:33.212
Let me donate.

19:33.312 --> 19:34.582
-Your heart can't tolerate...
-What my heart

19:34.682 --> 19:36.953
can't tolerate
is losing my daughter.

19:37.053 --> 19:38.656
I'll write a check.
(shudders)

19:38.757 --> 19:39.692
How much?

19:39.759 --> 19:40.794
-Just tell me.
-Tracy...

19:40.894 --> 19:42.463
You don't get to tell me
that I...

19:42.564 --> 19:45.302
(gasping)
can't risk my life for her.

19:45.369 --> 19:48.342
(panting)
I am her mother.

19:48.442 --> 19:51.448
(panting, groaning)

19:54.655 --> 19:55.757
She's in A fib.

19:55.824 --> 19:57.493
I'll page Dr. Austin.

19:58.863 --> 20:01.769
(panting)

20:07.046 --> 20:09.284
What did you tell her?

20:09.919 --> 20:12.791
I told I'm gonna help her.

20:13.927 --> 20:16.298
Don't make a liar out of me.

20:18.469 --> 20:20.439
All right.
Her A fib has slowed,

20:20.507 --> 20:23.312
but the rapid rate has landed
her in pulmonary edema.

20:23.345 --> 20:25.483
Tracy's in even worse shape
than we thought.

20:26.151 --> 20:28.990
How much time you think we have
before Max's liver fails?

20:29.057 --> 20:30.426
Based on what I've seen so far,

20:30.493 --> 20:32.230
she has days, at best.

20:36.873 --> 20:40.279
Look, I wasn't enthusiastic
about racing Tracy

20:40.346 --> 20:42.751
through a TAVR even when she was
in better shape.

20:42.785 --> 20:44.087
But now you want me
to take her to the cath lab

20:44.154 --> 20:45.624
while she's in heart failure?

20:45.690 --> 20:47.326
Dr. Austin, the sooner
you repair the valve,

20:47.393 --> 20:49.197
the sooner she can recover
and be ready for a transplant.

20:49.297 --> 20:51.401
Organ donation
from living donors

20:51.502 --> 20:52.538
is supposed to be low-risk.

20:52.604 --> 20:54.608
That's how we justify it.

20:55.209 --> 20:56.445
I can't risk the mom's life.

20:56.512 --> 20:57.815
-Randolph, you hear me.
-I do.

20:57.948 --> 20:59.451
As surgeons, we don't risk
a living person's life

20:59.518 --> 21:01.488
to give their organs
to someone else.

21:01.556 --> 21:02.958
Not to mention the guilt

21:03.025 --> 21:06.164
the child will feel
if the mother died saving her.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.536
I'm not gonna make
that child an orphan.

21:09.170 --> 21:12.845
Max doesn't get a liver, she
doesn't have a future at all.

21:13.445 --> 21:15.784
It's your call, AJ.

21:16.686 --> 21:18.923
If you can get Tracy
cleared for surgery,

21:19.023 --> 21:20.326
I'll operate with you.

21:21.027 --> 21:23.867
But whatever you decide,
you have my full support.

21:30.212 --> 21:33.318
I just reached
the damaged valve.

21:33.953 --> 21:38.462
And now I will deploy
the bioprosthetic.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.205
And once it opens,

21:43.305 --> 21:45.777
you should be able
to breathe easier.

21:47.346 --> 21:49.150
(inhales deeply)

21:49.217 --> 21:51.321
Oh...

21:51.421 --> 21:53.458
(inhales, chuckles softly)

21:54.394 --> 21:55.764
And after this?

21:55.897 --> 21:58.435
After this, you rest.

21:58.570 --> 22:01.576
The new valve
should make your heart relax

22:01.642 --> 22:03.913
and the fluid in your lungs
go down.

22:03.980 --> 22:05.584
And then I can donate

22:05.650 --> 22:07.988
if Max doesn't get better?

22:08.055 --> 22:10.861
We're all hoping
that Dr. Hawkins can figure out

22:10.927 --> 22:14.935
what's going on with your
daughter so you won't have to.

22:16.371 --> 22:17.340
But, yes,

22:17.440 --> 22:20.412
if she doesn't improve
by tomorrow,

22:48.235 --> 22:49.638
I need fresh eyes.
You got a minute?

more ear wax removal.

22:52.043 --> 22:53.145

22:53.212 --> 22:54.682
I got a sick girl.
Ten years old.

22:54.748 --> 22:57.888
Previously healthy with rapidly
progressive liver failure.

22:57.955 --> 22:59.224
Worsening coagulopathy.

22:59.290 --> 23:00.459
-What have you ruled out?
-Ischemia,

23:00.527 --> 23:03.766
toxic ingestions,
viral causes, autoimmune.

23:03.833 --> 23:04.902
Did you send CMV?

23:04.969 --> 23:06.606
Three times.

23:06.672 --> 23:09.110
An anti-smooth muscle antibody?

23:10.246 --> 23:11.916
Negative.

23:13.151 --> 23:14.320

23:14.387 --> 23:15.757

23:16.424 --> 23:18.095
Uh, any ingestions?
She's a kid,

maybe she was outside.

23:19.197 --> 23:20.567
No poison mushroom in the woods.

23:21.201 --> 23:23.640
So you really have ruled
everything out, haven't you?

23:24.440 --> 23:27.581
I think we both know
what this is.

23:30.754 --> 23:32.189
It's idiopathic.
We can't find

23:32.256 --> 23:34.561
the cause of Max's liver failure
and we'll likely never know.

23:34.662 --> 23:36.933
Words I never thought I'd live
to hear you say, Hawkins.

23:37.033 --> 23:39.605
Well, in over 20%
of hepatic failure cases,

23:39.672 --> 23:40.774
we never find the reason.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.343
Well, if we don't
know the cause,

23:42.443 --> 23:44.047
that means it could
recur after transplant.

23:44.113 --> 23:46.585
Yeah. But it's highly unlikely
based on everything I ruled out.

23:46.686 --> 23:48.656
And we all know she'll die
without a new liver.

23:48.723 --> 23:49.992
Of that, we can be sure.

23:50.092 --> 23:51.529
So we turn our attention
to Tracy and hope that

forward to tonight.

you know how I like to be right.

-Mm-hmm.

you were a bit

you'd be my forever.

believed I could be better.

A better... surgeon.
