00:42.418 --> 00:44.420
I missed you guys.

00:46.464 --> 00:48.132
My beautiful waves!

01:23.125 --> 01:25.377
What are you making
for dinner tonight?

01:26.629 --> 01:27.630
Minato?

01:38.808 --> 01:40.392
She's back.

01:42.686 --> 01:43.938
You know that girl?

01:45.773 --> 01:48.400
That's my hero, out there.

02:14.510 --> 02:18.806
RIDE YOUR WAVE

03:04.226 --> 03:05.186
Hello?

03:05.352 --> 03:06.937
MUKAIMIZU LANDSCAPING
Hello, Mom?

03:07.104 --> 03:09.440
Hinako? Did you tidy your room?

03:09.648 --> 03:11.984
What? Yeah, sure.

03:12.443 --> 03:14.320
Are you eating properly?

03:14.486 --> 03:16.405
I made omelet with rice.

03:16.906 --> 03:20.868
So did I. Your brother said that's
what he wanted for dinner.

03:22.494 --> 03:24.163
How's university going?

03:24.580 --> 03:27.166
I haven't started yet, mum!

03:27.541 --> 03:30.002
I still don't know why you
chose oceanography.

03:30.836 --> 03:32.838
I like the sea.

03:33.005 --> 03:35.090
Are you sure you'll be able to keep up?

03:35.299 --> 03:38.677
Don't worry, I'll be fine!
I'll call you back, okay?

03:38.844 --> 03:40.596
Okay, then. Speak soon.

03:42.973 --> 03:43.891
Oww.

03:45.559 --> 03:48.979
I hope I'm right about all this...

03:51.106 --> 03:52.399
<i>Deploy the second hose!</i>

03:52.566 --> 03:53.275
Yes, sir!

04:03.953 --> 04:04.995
Direct attack!

04:11.669 --> 04:14.088
–<i>Put your back into it, Kawamura!</i>
–Yes, sir.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.091
<i>Spray pattern!</i>

04:19.468 --> 04:20.678
<i>Straight stream!</i>

04:21.303 --> 04:22.638
<i>Increase the water pressure!</i>

04:22.846 --> 04:24.014
<i>Maximum pressure!</i>

04:24.807 --> 04:25.891
<i>Spray pattern!</i>

04:27.101 --> 04:28.227
<i>Straight stream!</i>

04:30.187 --> 04:32.606
<i>Hey, what are you doing? Pick it up!</i>

04:33.440 --> 04:34.316
<i>Cut it!</i>

04:37.278 --> 04:39.154
<i>Kawamura!</i>

04:39.571 --> 04:42.741
–I'm really sorry. Are you okay?
–<i>Practice is over!</i>

04:42.992 --> 04:45.411
–<i>Pack it up!</i>
–It's fine, I've got my swimsuit on.

04:47.913 --> 04:50.457
Here, have this towel. It's clean.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.710
Don't worry, I'm fine.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.171
Okay. Thank you.

04:56.338 --> 04:57.548
Don't worry about returning it.

04:57.715 --> 05:01.635
My family hands them out every year as
New Year's gifts. You can have that one.

05:03.762 --> 05:06.724
Actually, I'm a bit lost.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.017
Where are you headed?

05:08.183 --> 05:11.395
–I'm trying to get home.
–Oh, right...

05:11.854 --> 05:13.480
I've just moved to the area.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.065
Do you know the address?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.318
I know the name of the building!

05:17.651 --> 05:20.404
–It's called Sunrise Katamiya.
–Oh!

05:20.612 --> 05:22.281
The block next to the building site?

05:22.448 --> 05:23.240
That's the one.

05:23.407 --> 05:26.160
How come you know it?
That's impressive.

05:26.327 --> 05:29.496
<i>Kawamura. Are you going to
show her the way, or what?</i>

05:29.663 --> 05:33.500
I'm sorry, I'd really like to
but I'm on duty, right now.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.712
Don't worry. If you could
just point me in the right direction.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.423
If you just go straight on,

05:39.590 --> 05:43.177
take a right at the white apartment block,
and take the second left after that.

05:43.344 --> 05:46.555
You'll see the school, after which
you'll have to take the next right.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.850
Right, left, the school and right again.

05:50.059 --> 05:52.936
–<i>Kawamura, put the hose away!</i>
–I'm coming.

05:53.187 --> 05:53.979
See ya!

05:54.229 --> 05:55.731
Take care.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.693
Don't get lost, hero lady!

06:08.202 --> 06:10.662
Right.

06:12.206 --> 06:13.999
Left.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.462
School!

06:22.424 --> 06:23.801
Where am I now?

06:27.054 --> 06:28.722
Huh? Wait, what?

06:33.852 --> 06:36.522
Gimme a break, man...

06:48.700 --> 06:53.038
–Go, go!
–Woo! Awesome!

07:07.094 --> 07:08.762
Go, go, go!

07:19.982 --> 07:21.859
Fire! It's going up in flames!

07:22.025 --> 07:23.235
There's a fire!

07:23.402 --> 07:26.071
–Fire!
–Get outta there!

07:28.615 --> 07:32.786
<i>A fire's started at 43rd street, Katamiya.
It's spread to the neighboring building.</i>

07:42.212 --> 07:43.297
Protective clothing on.

07:43.589 --> 07:47.509
–Boots on.
–It's the block your hero lives in!

07:47.676 --> 07:50.304
–Bunker pants on!
–Collar on!

07:50.929 --> 07:51.680
<i>Boots on!</i>

07:51.847 --> 07:53.891
–Coat on!
–Collar on!

07:54.057 --> 07:56.810
Safety belt on. Fittings on.

08:07.446 --> 08:10.282
Someone set off a bunch
of professional fireworks.

08:17.206 --> 08:19.082
Err... my phone!

08:24.630 --> 08:25.923
Ahh, my purse!

08:35.474 --> 08:36.350
Start it up!

08:49.488 --> 08:51.448
Ignition point on the 6th floor staircase.

08:51.615 --> 08:53.909
Draw-off water from
the 5th floor hydrant!

08:54.076 --> 08:56.453
–Hoses 2 and 3 get up there!
–Yes, sir!

08:57.246 --> 09:00.958
One, two. One, two.

09:01.250 --> 09:05.420
One, two. One, two.

09:06.338 --> 09:08.048
Ah! Hey, wait!

09:22.062 --> 09:22.729
Do it!

09:27.234 --> 09:30.529
We're carrying out a room number
check, so make your way, please.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.198
I forgot teddy!

09:33.365 --> 09:36.493
The fire is being contained and residents
have evacuated to the ground floor.

09:36.702 --> 09:38.537
One woman from
the 8th floor remains unsighted.

09:38.704 --> 09:41.582
Once fires 2 and 3 are out, confirm
the safety of the 8th floor resident!

09:41.790 --> 09:42.791
<i>Roger!</i>

10:06.023 --> 10:08.817
Help!

10:09.276 --> 10:11.528
Someone's waving from the roof.
Get up there!

10:14.906 --> 10:16.366
Are you okay?

10:36.637 --> 10:38.138
Are you alright?

10:39.389 --> 10:40.349
I... erm...

10:40.807 --> 10:42.017
Are you injured?

10:42.225 --> 10:43.935
No, I'm okay.

10:44.436 --> 10:47.230
Keep calm. We'll get you down from here.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.900
Can I take my board, too?

10:51.401 --> 10:52.402
Of course.

10:53.528 --> 10:56.198
It's a bit tight, so please
crouch down when you get on.

10:56.948 --> 10:59.618
We've rescued a resident.
Take us down, please.

11:13.965 --> 11:15.926
–Check the 8th floor!
–Okubo.

11:16.093 --> 11:17.678
–Good job.
–Hooyah!

11:18.136 --> 11:21.181
Breaking and entering,
and an unlicensed use of fireworks!

11:21.890 --> 11:24.643
–You're safe now.
–Thank you.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.478
No, thank you.

11:27.396 --> 11:31.024
Hinageshi! You're not supposed to take
items on the cherry picker!

11:31.191 --> 11:32.025
Sorry, sir.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.819
Sorry. I got you in trouble.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.321
That board must mean a lot to you.

11:37.072 --> 11:40.033
I've been using it since I was a kid,
so it's pretty beaten up.

11:40.283 --> 11:41.618
I hope to see you again,

11:41.827 --> 11:43.412
riding the waves.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.331
I can see you from the rooftop.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.625
–The one at the fire sta--
–<i>Hinageshi! Time to go!</i>

11:50.293 --> 11:52.087
–See ya.
–Say, umm...

11:53.338 --> 11:56.758
How about, next time... If you like...

11:57.426 --> 12:00.178
If you like, I could
show you how to ride the waves.

12:00.971 --> 12:03.223
Or, maybe you already know how?

12:11.481 --> 12:15.444
–That's the way.
–Looking good!

12:15.610 --> 12:16.737
One more shot!

12:17.988 --> 12:21.158
–Come on!
–Show us what you've got!

12:21.324 --> 12:24.035
–That's it!
–Go on!

12:24.161 --> 12:26.413
–You're so close.
–Your feet. Lift your feet!

12:27.873 --> 12:30.125
–Get 'em up.
–You can do it!

12:31.501 --> 12:32.544
Another shot!

12:34.463 --> 12:36.339
–Bring your feet up!
–Atta boy!

12:36.506 --> 12:38.008
Give it another go! Come on!

12:42.888 --> 12:43.889
One more time!

12:44.055 --> 12:45.599
Keep a cool head!

12:49.770 --> 12:52.022
Go on, go on! You can do it!

12:53.398 --> 12:55.776
You can still do it! Nearly there!

12:56.193 --> 12:57.527
Go on, go on! That's it!

12:58.403 --> 13:00.655
You can still do it! Not far now!

13:02.532 --> 13:03.575
Well done out there.

13:05.619 --> 13:07.913
I'm not sure I'm cut out for this.

13:08.079 --> 13:10.749
When you get knocked down,
just get back up.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.834
You say that like it's easy.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.754
I might've gone down the wrong path.

13:16.546 --> 13:19.382
Has Mr. Koba ever shown you his map?

13:19.758 --> 13:24.095
He knows all the water systems and already
learned all the shortcuts since he joined.

13:24.346 --> 13:26.681
Getting that good is no mean feat.

13:26.932 --> 13:30.769
Only those with enough grit to push on
through can ever reach that level.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.231
You're a strong guy.
I'm sure you could do better than me.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.942
–Later.
–Minato...

13:37.484 --> 13:39.611
You seem in a pretty good mood...

13:40.320 --> 13:42.322
I'm off to ride some waves.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.627
Was this a bit early for you?

13:55.794 --> 13:59.130
Oh, no, not at all.
I'm not sleepy in the slightest.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.258
Huh? That's strange.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.385
You can have a sleep until we get there.

14:03.552 --> 14:05.303
All that tidying
must have been a real pain.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.390
I've just moved from
the 8th floor to the 2nd.

14:08.557 --> 14:09.558
It's perfect.

14:09.724 --> 14:12.310
Those balconies are made of
really flammable materials.

14:12.477 --> 14:15.981
The flames went straight up from
the bottom eating its way through them.

14:16.398 --> 14:17.524
Take care in there.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.401
Okay, I'll be careful.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.278
Seriously, though...

14:21.444 --> 14:23.822
They were setting off fireworks
from a building site, right?

14:23.989 --> 14:26.283
And you have to risk your lives
even for morons like that...

14:26.449 --> 14:28.702
I do wish people were a bit more careful.

14:28.910 --> 14:32.163
Apparently sharing videos like that
on the internet is the new in-thing.

14:32.622 --> 14:35.250
I used to live around
there, when I was a kid,

14:35.417 --> 14:38.086
but we moved away when Dad
took over the family business.

14:38.587 --> 14:40.547
I always wanted to come back though,

14:40.797 --> 14:42.591
so I applied for university here.

14:43.717 --> 14:47.137
And what about you... um...

14:47.304 --> 14:47.929
What?

14:48.138 --> 14:52.267
I'm sorry. I still don't know
how your name is read.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.185
It's "Hinageshi".

14:54.895 --> 14:58.648
You read it "Hinageshi"?
"Minato Hinageshi"?

14:59.774 --> 15:03.111
Just call me Minato.
As long as you don't call me "Ko".

15:03.486 --> 15:06.114
My surname is "Mukaimizu", by the way.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.992
People always call me "Mukomizu", though.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.452
In any case,

15:10.619 --> 15:13.788
just remember to get to your ground
floor quickly if a fire breaks out.

15:14.456 --> 15:16.333
Is that a finless porpoise?

15:16.499 --> 15:18.543
Spot on! And <i>not</i> a beluga whale.

15:18.710 --> 15:23.214
I knew it! I thought you might like them.
Even your car looks a bit like one.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.508
I love them, too.

15:26.217 --> 15:28.678
Don't they remind you of Q-Taro the ghost?

15:29.304 --> 15:32.390
How about some music?
Is there anything in particular you like?

15:32.724 --> 15:34.517
Whatever you like.

15:35.477 --> 15:36.394
In that case...

15:41.149 --> 15:43.693
This song sure brings back memories!

15:43.860 --> 15:46.237
They play it quite often since
it was used in that film.

15:46.821 --> 15:50.867
The water I see you looking out on

15:51.034 --> 15:55.455
Shimmers ever so brilliantly in the light

15:55.622 --> 16:00.210
And even as its colors change slowly

16:00.377 --> 16:04.005
It keeps on glistening in the sun

16:10.011 --> 16:11.680
So you bought yourself a board?

16:11.846 --> 16:13.807
I thought it'd be
the best way to improve quickly.

16:14.599 --> 16:15.725
And I've always wanted

16:16.184 --> 16:18.895
to drive with a board attached to my roof.

16:21.940 --> 16:25.402
A full wetsuit in the height of summer...

16:25.860 --> 16:28.905
Very cool! You'll pick it up
in no time I'm sure.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.032
Lift your head up,

16:31.324 --> 16:32.867
now paddle, paddle, paddle!

16:33.034 --> 16:36.705
Paddle, paddle, paddle, paddle!
Now, pop up in one go!

16:38.415 --> 16:39.749
Paddle, paddle!

16:40.667 --> 16:42.919
Now, pop up!

16:49.009 --> 16:50.468
Paddle, paddle, paddle!

16:53.346 --> 16:55.849
Good. Now stand! Get your balance!

17:01.438 --> 17:02.772
Are you okay?

17:03.857 --> 17:05.066
In the afternoon...

17:07.109 --> 17:09.319
I'll try harder...

17:14.492 --> 17:16.953
–I'm going to brew some coffee.
–Using that thing?

17:19.204 --> 17:20.874
That smells so good.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.961
I made a blend that would suit
the sandwiches.

17:27.797 --> 17:30.050
Freshly ground beans make
the coffee bloom.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.426
Why's that?

17:31.634 --> 17:35.263
When you use a dripper and freshly
ground beans, carbon dioxide is released.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.390
Sounds complicated.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.689
I'll get on with the egg sandwiches.

17:50.445 --> 17:53.573
You're great at everything, aren't you...

17:53.782 --> 17:55.825
Are you a superhero? Maybe Superman?

18:05.168 --> 18:07.170
They look great!

18:09.005 --> 18:11.091
I was thinking when you
rescued me from those flames,

18:11.257 --> 18:14.052
you're basically like a hero,
aren't you, Hinageshi-san.

18:14.219 --> 18:15.595
That's an exaggeration...

18:16.012 --> 18:18.431
And you can call me Minato, you know.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.518
I hope you'll let me use
your first name, too.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.021
WATCH OUT FOR KITES!!

18:25.188 --> 18:27.107
He got my sandwich!

18:27.273 --> 18:28.274
Paddle, paddle.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.239
That's it. Now, stand up!

18:37.033 --> 18:39.369
That's it! You're doing great!

18:47.418 --> 18:49.462
WATER DRIP - PAPER DRIP
NEL DRIP - FRENCH DRIP

19:10.692 --> 19:11.818
I'm sorry.

19:12.026 --> 19:15.029
I'm still rubbish, despite you coming
with me somewhere easy.

19:15.196 --> 19:19.450
The next wave is always just on
the horizon, waiting to be caught.

19:21.703 --> 19:25.957
And if we hadn't come here, I wouldn't
have got to sit in this lovely cafe.

19:27.375 --> 19:30.253
This place has been a favorite
of mine for a while now.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.007
Good to see they've got
a few extinguishers.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.719
Something tells me, Hinageshi...

19:37.886 --> 19:40.597
Minato, that if ever I'm in trouble,
you'll be there to save me.

19:41.639 --> 19:43.850
I'll always be there for you.
For sure.

19:47.478 --> 19:49.480
We'd better get going.

19:49.731 --> 19:50.773
Oh, okay.

19:51.482 --> 19:52.817
I'll do it.

19:52.984 --> 19:54.319
It's fine, really.

19:55.570 --> 19:56.696
Hey, wait!

20:03.203 --> 20:04.245
I'm so sorry!

20:04.412 --> 20:06.623
Don't worry. It's okay.

20:06.789 --> 20:09.000
It's an old hand-operated dumbwaiter...

20:09.209 --> 20:10.418
You're from Tokyo?

20:10.627 --> 20:11.586
Chiba, actually.

20:11.753 --> 20:13.546
Oh, really?

20:13.713 --> 20:16.966
A guy who used to work here has
just opened a café there.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.885
You should pop in sometime.

20:19.093 --> 20:22.847
He's got slightly more modern
equipment there than this old place.

20:25.099 --> 20:28.353
I wouldn't mind running
a café like this too, someday.

20:28.853 --> 20:31.147
Sorry about getting
all flustered back there.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.107
I'd like to...

20:34.442 --> 20:38.738
I'd like to ride the waves with you again.
Well, I'm hardly riding them yet, but...

20:39.405 --> 20:41.574
Maybe we could grab
another coffee, together.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.785
And even go for a ride somewhere else.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.287
Eh? Err...

20:47.747 --> 20:48.748
Sure.

20:50.375 --> 20:55.004
<i>The water I see you looking out on,</i>

20:55.171 --> 21:00.343
<i>Shimmers ever so brilliantly in the light</i>

21:00.843 --> 21:04.055
<i>And even as its colors change slowly,</i>

21:04.222 --> 21:05.265
Who's that?

21:05.640 --> 21:09.727
<i>It keeps on glistening in the sun</i>

21:10.228 --> 21:14.482
<i>Yes, life will sometimes try and test you</i>

21:14.691 --> 21:19.153
<i>The path will not always be clear</i>

21:19.320 --> 21:24.117
<i>And all you do is
stand there dumbfounded</i>

21:24.284 --> 21:30.248
<i>But if you manage
to push through the pain...</i>

21:31.082 --> 21:36.212
<i>That's right
The moment you open your eyes again,</i>

21:36.754 --> 21:41.217
<i>Is the start of a brand new story</i>

21:41.342 --> 21:46.264
<i>Just take one step forward
and you will see</i>

21:46.431 --> 21:51.144
<i>A path will open up in front of you</i>

21:51.311 --> 21:55.023
<i>That leads where you promised each other</i>

21:55.189 --> 21:59.944
<i>You would meet again</i>

22:04.741 --> 22:09.370
<i>Yes, at times, there will be many tears</i>

22:09.537 --> 22:14.709
<i>You'll find it hard to laugh
and smile much at all</i>

22:15.126 --> 22:19.881
<i>But just remember,
that someday soon enough</i>

22:20.048 --> 22:24.469
<i>Those tears will all be dried up</i>

22:24.635 --> 22:28.890
<i>No two waves are ever the same,</i>

22:29.182 --> 22:33.936
<i>Every one of them is
different from the last</i>

22:34.103 --> 22:38.524
<i>Take that chance right now to be brave,</i>

22:38.691 --> 22:45.323
<i>Face your fears,
and discover courage unsurpassed</i>

22:45.656 --> 22:51.079
<i>That's right,
More beautiful than imaginable</i>

22:51.245 --> 22:55.541
<i>A dazzling, bright, brand new story</i>

22:55.917 --> 22:59.462
–That flower shop attendant is so cute!
–He sure is.

22:59.712 --> 23:00.922
Er, I'm just a customer.

23:01.089 --> 23:02.715
Where have you come from?

23:02.882 --> 23:05.927
We're on our way to watch the fireworks.

23:06.094 --> 23:08.679
How about joining us? I had to ask...

23:09.514 --> 23:11.682
I've already got plans, I'm afraid.

23:12.433 --> 23:16.104
<i>All those days we spent with each other</i>

23:16.813 --> 23:21.275
<i>I could never forget even one</i>

23:21.442 --> 23:25.071
<i>Every single memory</i>

23:25.488 --> 23:30.451
<i>Still shining deep in our hearts</i>

23:31.452 --> 23:34.622
<i>Now and forever</i>

23:35.790 --> 23:41.587
<i>So, just keep your chin up
and look straight ahead</i>

23:41.754 --> 23:45.425
<i>I know there is courage inside of you</i>

23:45.591 --> 23:51.097
<i>That's right,
The moment you open your eyes again,</i>

23:51.305 --> 23:55.518
<i>Is the start of a brand new story</i>

23:55.768 --> 24:00.648
<i>Just take one step forward
and you will see</i>

24:00.940 --> 24:05.611
<i>A path will open up in front of you</i>

24:05.736 --> 24:09.157
<i>That leads where you promised each other</i>

24:09.449 --> 24:14.245
You would meet again

24:17.915 --> 24:19.041
<i>One and two and...</i>

24:19.208 --> 24:22.545
<i>My brand new story</i>

24:36.100 --> 24:37.727
Like this.

24:39.145 --> 24:41.647
Now have a taste.

24:45.902 --> 24:47.987
You're right, it's not too sweet,
but tastes great.

24:48.446 --> 24:50.448
You two are syrupy enough as it is.

24:51.032 --> 24:52.742
Sorry about my sister,
she's always a bit rude.

24:52.909 --> 24:54.785
I'll thank you not to apologize for me.

24:55.369 --> 24:56.537
She speaks her mind.

24:56.787 --> 24:58.206
I think we'll get on fine.

24:58.456 --> 24:59.248
Excuse me?

24:59.415 --> 25:02.168
My friends all have sharp tongues
and speak their mind.

25:02.418 --> 25:04.879
Jun, the scorpion and Ai, the cobra.

25:05.046 --> 25:06.589
What's with those nicknames?

25:07.173 --> 25:09.550
In that case, Yoko can be
a blue-ringed octopus.

25:09.717 --> 25:10.426
An octopus?

25:10.593 --> 25:15.097
It may be small, but its saliva contains
vast amounts of venomous tetrodotoxin.

25:15.389 --> 25:17.642
You sure are a fountain
of knowledge, aren't you--

25:17.808 --> 25:18.684
I'm leaving.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.521
I just came because I was curious
to see who you were dating,

25:21.687 --> 25:23.606
and I've seen everything I need to see.

25:23.773 --> 25:24.899
What's that supposed to mean?

25:25.149 --> 25:27.318
That being in love makes you
act all stupid!

25:27.527 --> 25:31.822
This blue-ringed octopus is so full
of venom she needs to go home. Bye.

25:32.365 --> 25:34.116
See you soon, Yoko.

25:34.283 --> 25:34.951
Soon?

25:35.409 --> 25:37.662
I just developed resistance
to octopus venom, so no sweat.

25:37.828 --> 25:38.579
Hmph!

25:41.832 --> 25:44.168
I'm glad you can
stay cool like that, Hinako.

25:44.877 --> 25:48.422
That attitude of hers doesn't help
when it comes to making friends.

25:48.673 --> 25:50.633
She'd been avoiding school for a while.

25:51.551 --> 25:54.220
But she recently started going again.

25:54.679 --> 25:55.513
Is that right?

25:56.138 --> 25:58.724
I know she's a pain,
but I'd like you guys to be friends.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.142
No problem!

26:07.191 --> 26:10.027
It's Mount Fuji! You can see Mount Fuji!

26:15.783 --> 26:17.827
How pretty.

26:18.744 --> 26:22.039
<i>This is a message from
Shota Namikoshi, to Mai Uchida.</i>

26:22.206 --> 26:26.294
<i>Merry Christmas!
Let's stay together forever.</i>

26:26.460 --> 26:27.712
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

26:28.421 --> 26:31.507
–Isn't that wonderful. How lovely...
–Really?

26:32.049 --> 26:35.011
They read out big messages if
you book a slot far enough in advance.

26:36.637 --> 26:38.723
Do you wanna go up?

26:39.056 --> 26:41.392
<i>This message is going out
to Yoshiko Kamiichi.</i>

26:41.601 --> 26:44.145
<i>Thank you for everything, Mom.</i>

26:44.895 --> 26:45.938
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

26:46.397 --> 26:49.984
What a view!
I wonder if we can see my house?

26:52.153 --> 26:53.487
My, my...

26:54.071 --> 26:55.197
Shall we write one, too?

26:55.781 --> 26:58.492
What? Sure. What do you wanna write?

26:58.659 --> 27:00.953
You still can't write
my name can you, Hinako?

27:01.120 --> 27:02.246
Of course I can!

27:02.705 --> 27:03.789
Let's see it, then.

27:05.333 --> 27:09.670
HINAKO MUKAIMIZU

27:10.087 --> 27:11.130
And...

27:13.466 --> 27:16.010
MINATO HINAGESHI

27:16.177 --> 27:19.013
Your surname is too hard to write, Minato.

27:19.221 --> 27:21.849
What're you going to do when it
becomes your surname?

27:22.475 --> 27:23.643
What?

27:26.729 --> 27:27.730
Say...

27:27.897 --> 27:29.440
What a queue for photos.

27:29.649 --> 27:34.028
Very nice, you two. What a cute couple.

27:34.403 --> 27:37.698
<i>Great! Let's take one more, though.</i>

27:38.074 --> 27:41.911
–<i>What a good one that was.</i>
–Hinako, over here. Come, see.

27:42.453 --> 27:44.580
<i>Another cute couple. Here we go.
Get in close.</i>

27:44.747 --> 27:47.541
<i>Your boyfriend sure looks strong.
Smile and relax.</i>

27:47.708 --> 27:51.253
–The key to your heart...
–<i>One more big smile for the camera!</i>

27:57.426 --> 27:58.803
It's snowing!

28:01.138 --> 28:03.766
I wish I didn't have to work tomorrow.

28:03.933 --> 28:06.018
Who wants to work on Christmas day...

28:06.268 --> 28:10.314
You know, after a good snowfall,
you get these great big waves.

28:10.815 --> 28:14.735
They say if you manage to catch one
your wish will come true.

28:14.985 --> 28:17.154
But, I've still never
managed to do it.

28:30.793 --> 28:31.961
That's amazing!

28:32.378 --> 28:34.714
How d'you get it
to look so perfect, like that?

28:35.464 --> 28:38.592
The outside needs to be nicely cooked
while keeping the inside soft and squishy.

28:38.843 --> 28:41.887
Getting the egg to envelope the rice is
all about keeping that softness.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.182
See? Just like that.

28:45.808 --> 28:47.977
–D'you wanna put it on the rice?
–Yeah.

28:50.855 --> 28:53.274
Don't rush it. You can still--

28:57.069 --> 29:00.072
You're sure you don't mind having omelet with rice
out here on Christmas day?

29:00.239 --> 29:03.993
Yep. Omelet with rice was always a treat
for me when I was a kid.

29:04.869 --> 29:07.288
And I wanted it to be just the two of us.

29:07.955 --> 29:11.876
–Can you eat with your left hand, though?
–No sweat, I've been practicing.

29:12.042 --> 29:14.628
I made sure I could eat while
holding your hand.

29:15.713 --> 29:18.549
I never want to let go of you
whenever we're together.

29:19.508 --> 29:22.303
How about we move in together, then?
I'll leave my parents' place.

29:22.595 --> 29:25.097
If you're gonna say stuff like that,
you'd better mean it.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.807
When's good for you, then?

29:27.600 --> 29:29.894
Well, I haven't thought
that far ahead yet.

29:33.647 --> 29:36.066
Once I can ride those waves...

29:36.609 --> 29:39.403
I feel like I rely on you
all the time, these days.

29:39.737 --> 29:42.698
But I hope I'll be able to find
my feet on dry land too,

29:43.157 --> 29:46.076
and finally find something
I'm good at, like you.

29:46.494 --> 29:50.039
You've got talent, Hinako.
I'm sure you'll find something in no time.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.374
I've never been especially
good at anything.

29:52.750 --> 29:54.460
You're kidding me, right?

29:55.127 --> 29:57.338
I nearly drowned at sea, when I was a kid.

29:57.880 --> 30:01.133
Even now, I still remember
being saved that day.

30:01.425 --> 30:05.888
I told myself I would become strong,
but I failed at everything I attempted.

30:07.097 --> 30:10.392
Then, one day I came across
a sea turtle hatchling.

30:10.601 --> 30:11.477
A sea turtle?

30:11.811 --> 30:13.270
You see them on the beach.

30:13.687 --> 30:14.563
You've never seen one?

30:14.730 --> 30:15.439
SEA TURTLES LAY THEIR EGGS HERE.

30:15.731 --> 30:16.941
Whoa! What are those?

30:17.608 --> 30:18.776
Turtles?

30:20.444 --> 30:22.988
Watching them march on towards
the ocean with such resolve,

30:23.197 --> 30:25.950
made me realize how I also
needed to persevere.

30:26.534 --> 30:29.495
So, I started going out on
beach patrols with my grandpa.

30:29.662 --> 30:32.289
That's when I started to see
the path I wanted to follow.

30:32.623 --> 30:37.002
I thought to myself that I wanted
a job where I got to help people.

30:38.128 --> 30:40.339
That's pretty awesome.

30:40.548 --> 30:44.760
I have a hard enough time taking
care of myself, let alone others.

30:44.927 --> 30:46.929
I'm the one always
getting help from others.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.640
You seem to be able to just
ride things out with ease.

30:50.140 --> 30:53.227
Well, I still can't ride the ocean
waves like you do.

30:53.853 --> 30:56.313
Just think of the sea and
the shore as being the same.

30:56.564 --> 31:00.067
You paddle a bit and when you get tired,
catch your breath, then paddle again.

31:01.068 --> 31:03.028
You can think of me as your harbor.

31:03.863 --> 31:07.324
Just call in whenever you need a break,
or if you need me there.

31:07.825 --> 31:10.327
How long will you be
there for me, I wonder.

31:11.287 --> 31:12.872
Ten, twenty years...

31:13.080 --> 31:15.040
Even when you're old and grey.

31:15.416 --> 31:18.127
Until you're able to ride
those waves alone.

31:28.929 --> 31:33.183
The water I see you looking out on

31:33.350 --> 31:38.606
Shimmers ever so brilliantly
in the light...

31:46.822 --> 31:47.573
GONE SURFING

31:47.740 --> 31:49.033
No way...

32:31.492 --> 32:35.663
No fair, Minato. Who said you
could go surfing without me!

33:15.661 --> 33:16.829
Hinako...

33:19.415 --> 33:20.708
Hinako!

33:28.424 --> 33:31.093
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SAVING TEDDY,
YUKI YOSHIKAWA

33:39.810 --> 33:40.978
Hello?

33:49.445 --> 33:53.490
<i>The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.</i>

33:53.824 --> 33:58.245
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

33:59.705 --> 34:01.582
<i>Hinako, are you there?</i>

34:01.915 --> 34:03.208
<i>Are you alright?</i>

34:04.209 --> 34:07.838
<i>Please call back when you're feeling
up to it. I'll be waiting.</i>

34:11.759 --> 34:16.889
<i>You had a missed call on
the 16th, at 14:42.</i>

34:26.815 --> 34:31.737
Excuse me! You are in there, right?
Please open the door!

34:37.076 --> 34:39.953
Sorry for barging in on you suddenly.

34:41.621 --> 34:44.123
So, you moved away
from the sea in the end...

34:45.000 --> 34:47.835
I thought I wouldn't have to
look at the sea if I moved here.

34:48.795 --> 34:52.257
These are some of the things
my brother was keeping at the station.

34:52.507 --> 34:54.009
D'you want anything from this box?

34:56.344 --> 34:59.723
I'm sorry for bringing these
over to you, without warning.

35:00.724 --> 35:02.351
It must be painful for you.

35:02.518 --> 35:04.311
Are you seriously crying
in someone's house?

35:04.478 --> 35:07.189
It's just... I never imagined I'd be

35:07.981 --> 35:10.067
sent out on a search and
rescue mission for Minato.

35:12.903 --> 35:14.863
It's just like him, though...

35:15.280 --> 35:17.199
Swimming out to help someone,

35:17.533 --> 35:19.076
and losing his life in the process.

35:19.243 --> 35:20.035
He didn't!

35:24.206 --> 35:28.544
He died because I said you get the best
waves after a heavy snowstorm.

35:28.752 --> 35:32.422
Stop it. Saying that won't
bring my brother back.

35:34.258 --> 35:36.468
I'm so... sorry.

35:37.928 --> 35:39.346
I'm sorry.

35:41.348 --> 35:43.308
This is his mobile phone.

35:43.642 --> 35:46.520
It's all yours. Bin it for all I care.
Chuck it all out!

35:46.687 --> 35:48.647
–Come on, Yoko...
–It's what she should do!

35:49.481 --> 35:52.442
This is my phone number, okay?

35:52.693 --> 35:55.696
If you need me for anything,
I'll be there.

35:56.738 --> 35:57.781
Yoko!

36:12.880 --> 36:14.464
Is that a finless porpoise?

36:15.048 --> 36:17.176
This is an app that
tracks surfing conditions.

36:17.301 --> 36:18.552
That's so cool.

36:19.219 --> 36:21.930
I'll install it on
your phone, too, Hinako.

36:31.982 --> 36:34.109
<i>The number you have dialed</i>

36:34.276 --> 36:36.528
<i>is currently unavailable.</i>

36:36.820 --> 36:39.573
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

36:39.865 --> 36:42.618
Get somewhere with some signal, would you!

36:43.035 --> 36:45.412
You said you'd be by
my side forever, didn't you?

36:52.836 --> 36:54.004
<i>Minato?</i>

37:16.568 --> 37:18.695
Come on, you've gotta eat.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.326
Here's some coffee, too.

37:27.537 --> 37:28.830
Hey, now...

37:31.708 --> 37:34.962
I know... everything you see
reminds you of him, doesn't it.

37:35.128 --> 37:36.797
–I'm sorry.
–It's fine.

37:36.964 --> 37:38.048
It's only normal.

37:38.674 --> 37:41.134
You're being so nice to me, Jun, Ai...

37:41.468 --> 37:44.721
When you always said that we were
a sappy couple, lovey-dovey idiots,

37:44.888 --> 37:47.683
and that all the normies
out there could explode.

37:47.891 --> 37:50.394
–Sorry...
–That was pretty harsh.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.397
–Is that...
–...your boyfriend's?

37:53.605 --> 37:56.233
It's locked though,
so I can't see what's on it.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.987
We always went out together,

38:00.237 --> 38:05.033
so why'd he decide to go surfing on
his own, out in the dark? I want to know.

38:10.414 --> 38:13.166
So, this is a blue-ringed octopus...

38:13.417 --> 38:17.129
–What date is your birthday, then?
–February 3rd.

38:17.421 --> 38:20.257
My brother never remembered
my birthday, you know.

38:20.882 --> 38:23.593
–When's the "sea day" holiday, again?
–July 15th.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.054
–And "Disaster Prevention Day"?
–September 1st.

38:26.680 --> 38:31.184
It's no-one I know's birthday. Nor the day
of the fire, or our first day surfing...

38:31.351 --> 38:33.228
It's none of the days I can think of.

38:33.395 --> 38:35.188
How about asking Wasabi?

38:35.647 --> 38:36.481
You met him, right?

38:36.648 --> 38:38.817
The guy who brought you
the box, Miss Mukomizu.

38:39.192 --> 38:40.402
Mr. Kawamura?

38:40.610 --> 38:43.447
And by the by, my name's Mukaimizu.

38:43.697 --> 38:47.284
I'll ask him out for a coffee.
He should be off today!

38:50.412 --> 38:51.955
This is the place we came to before.

38:52.873 --> 38:54.833
Their first branch opened
in Chigasaki, apparently.

38:55.959 --> 38:59.463
I wouldn't mind running
a place like this too, someday.

38:59.880 --> 39:03.342
–There are lots of ways to drink coffee.
–I never knew...

39:03.884 --> 39:05.344
I'm gonna have a strawberry soda!

39:11.475 --> 39:13.018
Sorry for the wait.

39:13.185 --> 39:15.354
–How did you manage that?
–Are you okay?

39:15.520 --> 39:18.857
–I'm sorry...
–Stay there, I'll be back with towels.

39:20.984 --> 39:22.152
I'm so sorry!

39:24.863 --> 39:27.532
Wipe those tears.
They'll dilute your coffee.

39:27.741 --> 39:28.658
I'm sorry.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.994
I never used to be such a cry baby.

39:31.161 --> 39:34.373
–I've seen babies that cry less than you!
–Yoko, come on.

39:34.748 --> 39:37.000
Sorry about my sharp tongue.

39:37.209 --> 39:41.713
It's okay...
You wouldn't be you without it.

39:45.133 --> 39:46.802
Hey, I know this track...

39:46.968 --> 39:50.972
Shimmers ever so brilliantly in the light.

39:51.181 --> 39:55.977
And even as its colors change slowly

39:56.395 --> 39:59.398
<i>It keeps on glistening in the sun</i>

40:02.859 --> 40:03.985
Minato?

40:08.407 --> 40:10.075
Hinako?

40:10.409 --> 40:12.702
I just saw... Minato.

40:12.869 --> 40:14.121
What are you babbling about?

40:14.663 --> 40:16.998
–Say! Are you alright in the head?
–Hey...

40:22.129 --> 40:23.255
Minato...

40:23.630 --> 40:25.048
Listen up, alright?

40:25.298 --> 40:29.261
Minato's not coming back!
Can you hurry up and accept it?

41:00.000 --> 41:04.421
The water I see you looking out on

41:04.588 --> 41:09.801
Shimmers ever so brilliantly in the light

41:10.010 --> 41:14.973
And even as its colors change slowly

41:15.140 --> 41:19.394
It keeps on glistening in the sun

41:19.603 --> 41:23.857
Yes, life will sometimes try and test you

41:24.065 --> 41:27.819
The path will not always be clear to you

41:29.404 --> 41:32.032
Why do I see him in the water...?

41:37.954 --> 41:40.081
I wonder, if I sing that song...

41:40.624 --> 41:44.961
The water I see you looking out on...

41:56.264 --> 41:59.059
–Girls...
–What?

41:59.976 --> 42:01.978
Do I seem weird to you?

42:02.187 --> 42:04.272
You mean weird looking,
or weird in the head?

42:05.148 --> 42:08.068
I shouldn't be seeing
hallucinations, should I?

42:08.527 --> 42:10.111
You're not on drugs, right?

42:10.278 --> 42:13.198
That'd be really bad. You're
already loopy enough as it is.

42:13.448 --> 42:15.158
Nope. Not taking drugs.

42:15.367 --> 42:17.994
But I can see him. I see Minato
wherever there's water.

42:19.788 --> 42:23.833
The water I see you looking out on!

42:24.000 --> 42:26.127
–Shimmers brilliantly in...
–Hey, hold up!

42:27.087 --> 42:28.421
Minato!

42:29.339 --> 42:32.133
See! He's looking at us
doing the Shaka sign!

42:32.551 --> 42:34.636
I think there really is
something wrong with her...

42:34.803 --> 42:36.721
Why don't you go back home for a while?

42:36.888 --> 42:39.432
You should take it easy, Hinako.

43:05.458 --> 43:09.462
HINAKO

43:11.131 --> 43:13.008
There, there! Look up!

43:31.860 --> 43:34.654
It's definitely Minato, I'm sure of it.

43:34.988 --> 43:38.450
Are you a ghost?
Does that mean you're in limbo?

43:39.284 --> 43:41.161
Is it because you died at sea...

43:41.536 --> 43:44.372
that you appear to me in water?

43:50.587 --> 43:54.257
I'm not seriously trying to take
a picture of a ghost, am I...?

43:55.884 --> 43:59.888
The water I see you looking out on

44:00.055 --> 44:04.559
Shimmers ever so brilliantly in the light

44:04.726 --> 44:06.519
And even as its colors...

44:24.621 --> 44:28.625
The water I see you looking out on

44:28.792 --> 44:30.043
Shimmers ever so...

44:32.671 --> 44:35.924
brilliantly in the light!

44:41.388 --> 44:44.891
The water I see you looking out on

44:50.522 --> 44:51.856
Minato!

45:00.031 --> 45:01.282
Why though...?

45:01.449 --> 45:04.828
I promised I'd always be there by
your side when you needed me, didn't I?

45:08.998 --> 45:10.041
Minato.

45:10.417 --> 45:11.584
Hinako.

45:11.835 --> 45:14.337
–This is a bit weird.
–It sure is.

45:15.213 --> 45:18.842
So, does this mean you couldn't pass on?

45:19.008 --> 45:20.635
I guess maybe it does...

45:20.802 --> 45:22.804
Did you leave anything unfinished?

45:23.054 --> 45:25.265
It might be that my wish came true.

45:34.023 --> 45:37.110
–You moved, didn't you?
–Eh? Yeah.

45:38.153 --> 45:39.237
You're not surfing?

45:40.864 --> 45:42.949
The sea makes me feel too sad.

45:43.283 --> 45:45.118
I'm sorry, that's my fault, isn't it?

45:45.285 --> 45:46.119
No, I didn't mean...

45:46.411 --> 45:48.997
Let's not waste time on sad stuff.

45:49.247 --> 45:52.792
Seeing and speaking to you again
is like a dream.

45:53.460 --> 45:56.963
So, you'll come out from the water
to see me when I sing that song, right?

45:57.130 --> 45:59.132
I'm not too sure, myself.

45:59.299 --> 46:01.509
But you can call on me
whenever you need my help.

46:02.552 --> 46:04.971
Yoko's doing well, by the way.
Same for Wasabi.

46:05.138 --> 46:06.890
Yeah, I saw them briefly.

46:07.056 --> 46:08.099
Right...

46:08.475 --> 46:11.186
It didn't seem like those two
could see you, though.

46:11.728 --> 46:13.813
Does that mean
that I'm the only one that can?

46:14.230 --> 46:17.484
As long as you can see me,
then that's good enough.

46:17.692 --> 46:18.693
I guess.

46:19.027 --> 46:20.612
Oh, yeah...

46:21.571 --> 46:23.198
Tell me your pin, please.

46:23.615 --> 46:26.326
What're you going to get
out of checking my phone, now?

46:27.285 --> 46:28.369
I wanna know why...

46:28.536 --> 46:31.998
Why you went out surfing alone,
without saying anything.

46:34.042 --> 46:35.627
Well...

46:36.252 --> 46:39.798
I wanted to practice in secret and
surprise you with how much I'd improved.

46:39.964 --> 46:42.258
–Seriously?
–I'm serious.

46:42.550 --> 46:47.305
I don't remember teaching my girlfriend
to check people's phones as she pleases.

46:47.597 --> 46:49.140
No fair!

46:51.559 --> 46:54.103
I'm soaked, so I'm going to
jump in the bath, okay?

46:55.063 --> 46:56.439
Don't go anywhere.

47:08.243 --> 47:11.830
What's this?
Am I living with Minato, then?

47:12.163 --> 47:14.374
Are we shacking up?
Or will we get married?

47:14.833 --> 47:16.626
Hinako Hinageshi?

47:18.461 --> 47:22.507
The water I see you looking out on

47:22.715 --> 47:27.554
Shimmers ever so brilliantly in the light

47:29.347 --> 47:31.808
Hey! You pervert!

47:31.975 --> 47:34.185
Oh, sorry. But you did start singing...

47:34.352 --> 47:36.479
Sorry. You just surprised me, is all.

47:36.855 --> 47:38.648
I don't mind, really.

49:52.115 --> 49:52.824
Are you okay?

49:53.157 --> 49:54.617
That was a shock to the system.

49:56.035 --> 49:57.203
I'm sorry.

49:57.370 --> 49:58.454
Where d'you come from?

49:58.830 --> 50:00.206
Umm... Chiba.

50:00.373 --> 50:03.876
We're in Chiba. Who's this big guy?

50:07.588 --> 50:08.840
Is something the matter?

50:11.259 --> 50:15.013
I was just thinking how
I can't hold your hand.

50:15.430 --> 50:18.016
I can't help you like
that guy did earlier, either.

50:18.141 --> 50:21.436
–Wait up, is that jealousy I detect?
–Of course not.

50:21.602 --> 50:23.021
I'm not going to cheat, okay?

50:23.187 --> 50:25.940
–You're the only one, Minato.
–That's not what I meant.

50:26.441 --> 50:29.819
I think this might be our first fight.
Come on, cheer up for me.

50:33.573 --> 50:37.201
–I want another one.
–Look who's being greedy.

50:40.496 --> 50:42.165
Do you forgive me now?

50:42.790 --> 50:43.750
Nope.

50:44.042 --> 50:46.377
I've got one more request.

50:46.586 --> 50:47.712
Go on, then.

50:47.920 --> 50:49.422
Take me to the sea.

50:50.173 --> 50:53.468
I want to see you surfing again.

51:11.069 --> 51:11.986
I'm sorry.

51:12.236 --> 51:13.654
I should be the one to apologize.

51:13.988 --> 51:17.241
I should've thought more about your
feelings before asking that of you.

51:19.035 --> 51:22.246
I used to live around here
when I was a kid.

51:23.039 --> 51:27.043
All I did was surf. I could ride
the waves whenever I liked.

51:27.877 --> 51:29.212
But now...

51:30.004 --> 51:32.048
whether it's at sea or on shore,

51:32.256 --> 51:35.718
I just don't know in which
direction I should be paddling.

51:40.056 --> 51:41.974
No matter how small the wave,

51:42.141 --> 51:44.894
it contains the power built-up
from traveling thousands of miles.

51:45.478 --> 51:48.272
Right now, you're being pushed back
by that power a little.

51:49.190 --> 51:51.317
I'm just one of those many waves.

51:51.692 --> 51:54.195
You have to prepare yourself
for the next one, though.

51:54.987 --> 51:56.781
Do you have to say sad stuff like that?

51:56.989 --> 52:00.576
I only need you, Minato.
I want to be with you forever.

52:00.993 --> 52:04.372
I'll be there for you, Hinako.
I'll support you however I can,

52:04.831 --> 52:07.375
until you're able to ride
the waves of life.

52:49.208 --> 52:52.086
Please come in.
Hey, what's up?

52:52.795 --> 52:55.506
Your mum told me
you started working here.

52:55.715 --> 52:57.842
There's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

52:58.217 --> 53:00.636
Boss. I'm going on my break.

53:01.179 --> 53:04.515
Here you go. On the house.
So, what brings you out here?

53:07.476 --> 53:08.394
It's fine.

53:08.603 --> 53:11.522
–Just remember to always be yourself...
–Yoko...

53:11.689 --> 53:14.483
That's what my brother
used to say, right? Buck up.

53:14.650 --> 53:18.863
Well, I'm not here to talk about how
I messed up at work or anything.

53:19.030 --> 53:20.072
You're not?

53:21.073 --> 53:22.867
It's about Hinako.

53:24.327 --> 53:26.204
You don't say...

53:26.370 --> 53:28.915
–She's acting strange.
–No change there, then.

53:29.582 --> 53:32.627
I've seen her talking to
a bottle of water.

53:32.793 --> 53:35.463
And walking hand-in-hand with
Minato's old blow-up porpoise.

53:35.963 --> 53:39.675
I think she's got it in her head
that Minato <i>is</i> the water.

53:39.926 --> 53:41.427
Have you been tailing her?

53:42.220 --> 53:44.555
–Well, I was worried...
–Why?

53:45.223 --> 53:46.557
I'm not sure.

53:47.600 --> 53:51.437
Minato would always look at her surfing
from the roof of the station,

53:51.604 --> 53:53.940
so, I started looking too and, well...

53:54.232 --> 53:56.984
But, she's Minato's girlfriend, so...

53:57.151 --> 53:59.695
I didn't mean to bring that up, though!

53:59.862 --> 54:03.574
I'm just worried about Hinako is all.
I can't help thinking about it.

54:03.741 --> 54:05.117
Wasabi, you dope.

54:05.409 --> 54:07.411
If you're worried about Hinako
it's her you should be talking to.

54:07.578 --> 54:10.039
Go tell her directly.
Why're you coming to me with this?

54:10.206 --> 54:11.749
You're in love with her, right?

54:13.000 --> 54:15.795
I'll tell you now. Love makes
people act stupid, you got that?

54:16.420 --> 54:18.881
Boss. I'm coming off my break!

54:33.896 --> 54:35.106
Sorry!

54:36.565 --> 54:38.943
I've been meaning to return
this to you for ages.

54:40.236 --> 54:42.321
You're the fireman I met that day?

54:42.863 --> 54:45.116
You hadn't realized, this whole time...?

54:45.616 --> 54:48.953
Sorry. It's only a bit of water, though.
No need for a towel.

54:49.662 --> 54:50.955
You're here to buy flowers?

54:51.747 --> 54:53.124
That's right.

54:54.166 --> 54:55.793
Heave ho.

54:59.046 --> 55:01.090
I hope she likes them.

55:01.590 --> 55:03.092
Whoever it is you're giving them to.

55:04.927 --> 55:08.597
It's someone who likes the sea,
so I figured I'd go with white and blue.

55:08.764 --> 55:13.144
–Although, maybe that's a bit cheesy.
–Definitely not, that's a lovely idea.

55:13.477 --> 55:14.603
Glad you think so.

55:16.272 --> 55:18.691
–I don't see you with it, today.
–What?

55:19.025 --> 55:21.652
You've been taking it with you
wherever you go, right?

55:21.777 --> 55:23.487
The flask filled with water, I mean.

55:23.738 --> 55:25.031
I'd better get back to work...

55:25.197 --> 55:27.408
Or the blow-up porpoise.

55:27.658 --> 55:28.868
How d'you know about that?

55:29.535 --> 55:34.749
I noticed when you came to the station,
and well, I saw you out and about with it...

55:34.999 --> 55:36.584
But I didn't want to stop you.

55:37.209 --> 55:40.254
It looked like you were talking to Minato
as though he were in the flask...

55:40.421 --> 55:41.714
Sorry, I tend to talk to myself.

55:41.881 --> 55:45.009
–But--
–The flowers will wilt if you don't hurry.

55:45.551 --> 55:47.678
Umm. These are for you, Hinako!

55:49.138 --> 55:51.307
Weren't you buying them for someone else?

55:51.599 --> 55:54.477
I've been watching you for a long time.

55:55.061 --> 55:56.896
Do you think you could ever be with me?

55:57.229 --> 55:59.774
Do you think I might be able to
make you happy?

56:00.441 --> 56:02.777
I want you to be happy, again.

56:02.943 --> 56:04.111
Because I'm in love with you!

56:05.488 --> 56:07.490
But, but... I...

56:08.282 --> 56:09.450
I'm sorry!

56:17.958 --> 56:22.213
The water I see you looking out on.

56:22.630 --> 56:23.631
What's up, Hinako?

56:23.798 --> 56:25.633
Wasabi just, he just...

56:25.800 --> 56:26.926
What happened?

56:27.218 --> 56:28.928
He just told me he loves me.

56:31.305 --> 56:32.765
And what about you?

56:32.932 --> 56:35.976
What <i>about</i> me? I love you, Minato.

56:36.936 --> 56:40.022
I can't hold your hand, Hinako.

56:40.356 --> 56:42.441
I can't hold you tight, or kiss you.

56:45.611 --> 56:47.613
He's a good guy.

56:47.905 --> 56:49.115
Minato...

56:49.448 --> 56:52.243
He's straight as an arrow
and has a gentle soul.

56:52.410 --> 56:54.161
Why d'you say stuff like that?

56:54.412 --> 56:55.955
I'm fine with things as they are.

56:56.122 --> 56:59.750
I can see you when I sing,
and even if we can't hold hands or hug,

56:59.917 --> 57:01.836
you said you'd be by
my side forever, right?

57:02.044 --> 57:04.255
–That's enough for me!
–Hinako, calm down!

57:04.547 --> 57:07.425
You're talking to a toilet. People are
going to start wondering about you.

57:09.718 --> 57:11.512
I got into a bit of a tizzy...

57:12.471 --> 57:14.181
Hinako, listen to me.

57:14.932 --> 57:17.518
New waves will always keep coming in.

57:18.018 --> 57:21.397
Not all of them will be good,
and you'll want to let those pass.

57:22.440 --> 57:24.358
But, if you stay with your head underwater

57:24.525 --> 57:26.735
you'll never learn to ride the waves.

57:46.630 --> 57:47.798
Hinako!

57:52.011 --> 57:54.221
–We need a fire extinguisher!
–Call the fire brigade!

57:54.346 --> 57:55.222
There's been a crash!

57:55.389 --> 57:56.932
The person in the little
car's not coming out.

57:57.099 --> 57:59.643
–There's nothing we can do.
–But they're still inside.

57:59.810 --> 58:01.312
–It's too dangerous!
–Minato would...

58:01.479 --> 58:03.230
Minato would go to their rescue!

58:04.231 --> 58:08.444
–The water I see you looking out on.
–Hinako...

58:08.611 --> 58:12.698
–Shimmers ever so brilliantly in the light.
–Hinako!

58:13.407 --> 58:17.786
And even as its colors change slowly,

58:17.953 --> 58:19.788
it keeps on glistening...

58:45.773 --> 58:47.525
–Minato!
–What's wrong...?

58:47.816 --> 58:50.694
–I can't hear Minato's voice.
–Hinako.

58:50.861 --> 58:52.238
Minato!

58:52.905 --> 58:54.740
–Minato, don't go!
–Hinako.

58:54.907 --> 58:56.784
Minato's turning into steam and leaving...

58:56.951 --> 58:58.744
Hinako, please get a hold of yourself!

58:58.911 --> 59:01.539
I don't want to say this,
but Minato is gone!

59:01.705 --> 59:04.750
–He's not a ghost.
–You might not see him, Wasabi.

59:04.917 --> 59:07.002
But I see him. He's in the water.

59:07.169 --> 59:11.048
He appears whenever I sing out to him.
I can see him...

59:11.298 --> 59:14.385
You say he's not there,
but it's not true!

59:14.593 --> 59:17.096
Minato said he'd be there, forever!

59:18.514 --> 59:22.851
I'm sure he loved you madly enough
to try and appear to you somehow,

59:23.018 --> 59:27.106
but I don't think he would have
ever wanted to see you in this state!

59:28.107 --> 59:31.902
Minato used to say this to me,
"Hinako is my hero."

59:32.695 --> 59:36.115
We all thought you were so cool riding
those waves on your own.

59:36.490 --> 59:37.825
What happened to you...?

59:38.617 --> 59:41.954
I know. But, I...

59:44.164 --> 59:48.127
Minato will never be able to pass on
if you stay like this, Hinako!

59:48.502 --> 59:49.837
Hinako!

59:53.591 --> 59:54.508
Minato!

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:05.144
The water I see you looking out on

01:00:05.311 --> 01:00:09.231
Shimmers ever so brilliantly in the light.

01:00:09.398 --> 01:00:11.942
–Hinako...
–I'm sorry, Minato.

01:00:12.067 --> 01:00:16.864
I know I asked too much of you.
I called out to you too many times.

01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:21.910
I don't know what to do. How am
I supposed to go on, if you leave me?

01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:23.787
I'm sorry.

01:00:43.557 --> 01:00:45.351
The water...

01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:55.069
Have a seat wherever you like.

01:00:59.073 --> 01:01:02.785
Our specialty is serving customers their
favorite coffee, in a variety of ways.

01:01:02.951 --> 01:01:04.703
I particularly recommend
the dripped coffee.

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:07.790
Whatever you choose, please don't
make it the strawberry soda.

01:01:08.374 --> 01:01:11.585
–That's amazing, Yoko.
–Did you come to make fun of me?

01:01:11.752 --> 01:01:14.797
Of course not. I just heard that
you work here, is all.

01:01:14.963 --> 01:01:16.632
–From Wasabi?
–Yeah.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.009
–Did he say anything else?
–What?

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:21.095
Not really.

01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:24.181
I really wish I was a blue-ringed octopus!

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:26.809
–I'd bite you good and hard!
–What?

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:29.478
Nothing....

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.357
Why are you working here anyway, Yoko?

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:35.693
I decided I'd open a café.

01:01:36.527 --> 01:01:40.197
My brother's dream was to run a café.
So, I decided to make his dream come true.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:44.034
I'm working here so
I can learn all about the business.

01:01:44.493 --> 01:01:49.623
Did you know that the reason coffee blooms
like that, is because it's releasing CO2?

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:52.876
It gets slowly released after
the beans have been roasted.

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:56.672
Once they're ground it keeps pouring out
of them, which stops the coffee blooming.

01:01:57.047 --> 01:02:00.300
The fact that it blooms like that means
that the beans are fresh.

01:02:00.509 --> 01:02:03.804
When I finish high school, I'll go get
trained at the main branch, in Chigasaki.

01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:08.142
You never know when
the two owners will pop their clogs.

01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:21.488
–Hold on. Keep going!
–Go, go, go!

01:02:31.707 --> 01:02:34.084
Straight to the house, this time?
A bit late, don't you think?

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:35.210
Sorry.

01:02:36.128 --> 01:02:40.174
I couldn't accept it at the time, so it's
taken me a while to come pay my respects.

01:02:42.384 --> 01:02:43.677
Where are your parents?

01:02:43.844 --> 01:02:44.887
At work.

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:47.264
They've just started working again.

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:49.683
So, I don't think they want
any reminders of my brother...

01:02:49.892 --> 01:02:51.560
Sorry, I didn't mean to bother you.

01:02:52.144 --> 01:02:54.104
My brother's room's been left untouched.

01:02:54.354 --> 01:02:56.398
–You wanna see it, right?
–Yeah.

01:03:01.153 --> 01:03:04.239
My brother always looked calm and cool,

01:03:04.406 --> 01:03:06.992
so people would often think
he never struggled with anything.

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.620
But he always worked hard
at everything he did.

01:03:09.745 --> 01:03:11.955
Both our parents work,

01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:15.918
so he would often make us dinner.
It tasted terrible in the beginning,

01:03:16.585 --> 01:03:19.421
but he'd read books and
watch cooking programs,

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:21.882
and before I knew it,
he was cooking delicious food.

01:03:22.758 --> 01:03:23.884
Even with his studies,

01:03:24.051 --> 01:03:30.140
he said that even after becoming a fireman
he had to keep working hard not to sink.

01:03:30.474 --> 01:03:31.809
I can never live up to that.

01:03:32.768 --> 01:03:34.812
After he died,

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:37.314
so many people came to
the house to pay their respects.

01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:39.817
They all said he'd helped them, somehow.

01:03:40.108 --> 01:03:44.738
Minato had always wanted to become
someone who would help others.

01:03:45.948 --> 01:03:48.116
One life-changing event
made him think that.

01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:52.704
He was saved from drowning
when he was a small boy.

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:56.083
The one who saved him was a girl
that even was smaller than him.

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:59.253
He said it pushed him to work hard
to achieve something in life.

01:04:00.879 --> 01:04:04.007
His life was saved by that young girl,

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:07.010
so he said he wanted to become
somebody who helped others.

01:04:07.845 --> 01:04:10.347
He said that, since his life
was saved by a hero,

01:04:10.722 --> 01:04:12.766
he wanted to make sure he used it

01:04:13.433 --> 01:04:15.310
to save others.

01:04:27.114 --> 01:04:29.575
What is it this time?

01:04:30.826 --> 01:04:32.327
MUKAIMIZU LANDSCAPING

01:04:43.297 --> 01:04:45.507
What the heavens made you
come rushing home so soon?

01:04:45.716 --> 01:04:48.844
D'you remember that story about me
saving a boy from drowning at sea?

01:04:49.469 --> 01:04:51.638
That time you got an award, you mean?

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:55.100
Just a second...

01:05:01.106 --> 01:05:02.024
Here it is.

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:04.276
He said you were his hero.

01:06:03.335 --> 01:06:06.046
–Incredible!
–Well done, girl!

01:06:09.675 --> 01:06:12.427
Bring the nurse here
when the ambulance arrives!

01:06:17.057 --> 01:06:19.518
He's okay! It's a miracle!

01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:21.728
–Tilt his head.
–Cough up that water, kid.

01:06:22.938 --> 01:06:24.356
You did good, kiddo.

01:06:30.028 --> 01:06:32.656
That little girl over there saved you!

01:06:33.824 --> 01:06:36.243
You owe her your life, buddy.

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:39.037
<i>He said that, since his life
was saved by a hero...</i>

01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:41.415
<i>I nearly drowned at sea, when I was a kid...</i>

01:06:41.581 --> 01:06:44.001
<i>Even now, I still remember
being saved that day...</i>

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:48.755
<i>I thought to myself that I wanted
a job where I got to help people.</i>

01:06:53.885 --> 01:06:56.638
Hinako? What about the strawberries?

01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:00.434
<i>The day I was reborn...</i>

01:07:01.018 --> 01:07:01.768
8 AUGUST 2006

01:07:01.935 --> 01:07:03.937
<i>Was the day I found my reason for being.</i>

01:07:13.864 --> 01:07:16.950
<i>Hinako, I rode the waves
after that snowstorm</i>

01:07:17.117 --> 01:07:18.744
<i>and pulled off an air reverse!</i>

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:22.539
<i>You said my wish would come true if
I rode these waves, didn't you?</i>

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:27.002
<i>My wish is that you'll be able
to ride your own waves.</i>

01:07:27.169 --> 01:07:28.253
<i>That, and...</i>

01:07:28.879 --> 01:07:32.257
<i>that I can be by your side, forever.</i>

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:53.945
<i>Watching them march on towards
the ocean with such resolve,</i>

01:07:54.112 --> 01:07:56.281
<i>made me realize how I also
needed to persevere.</i>

01:08:03.121 --> 01:08:07.834
JOBS HELPING OTHERS

Of course you'll learn how
to rescue people out at sea,

01:08:37.948 --> 01:08:41.283
but the main aim is to learn how to
prevent accidents from happening.

01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:45.455

There will also be games to take part in.

01:08:58.426 --> 01:09:00.136
Hey!

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.309
You go running even on your days off?

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:10.188
Well, I need to know where all
the hydrants are, they often change them.

01:09:10.939 --> 01:09:12.858
It means I get a run out of it.

01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:14.901
It's not really in
my job description, though.

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:17.904
Big bro always used to go around
making sure everything was safe.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:20.907
He'd say that the best way
to stop a fire is to prevent it.

01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:23.827
Yeah, Minato sure was amazing.

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:26.412
I don't think any amount of
effort will mean I can...

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:29.082
Nope, you'll never fill his boots.

01:09:30.584 --> 01:09:32.002
You're right about that.

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:34.045
Do you think you could ever be with me?

01:09:34.296 --> 01:09:37.340
Do you think I might be able to
make you happy?

01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:41.219
Why d'you become a fireman, Wasabi?

01:09:41.636 --> 01:09:45.182
Why? Well, firemen are cool, aren't they?

01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:47.767
I always wanted to drive
one of those neat fire engines.

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:50.270
You say that like it's an obvious reason.
You're serious?

01:09:50.437 --> 01:09:51.270
Thanks.

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:53.023
–The sugar's there.
–Okay.

01:09:54.191 --> 01:09:57.110
Maybe I was a bit naive
when I chose a job for life.

01:09:57.611 --> 01:09:58.570
–You want some?
–Err...

01:09:58.737 --> 01:10:02.407
I've always been pretty sporty,
but man do you burn energy.

01:10:03.575 --> 01:10:06.661
No matter how hard I try,
I'll never be as good as Minato.

01:10:07.871 --> 01:10:10.165
I'm not convinced
I'm cut out to be a fireman.

01:10:10.582 --> 01:10:14.419
Something as ambitious as saving
people is well beyond my abilities.

01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:20.300
–This is sickly sweet.
–No kidding.

01:10:20.508 --> 01:10:22.302
Sorry, I put way too much sugar in.

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:24.346
I don't have Minato's taste buds either--

01:10:24.512 --> 01:10:26.598
You're starting to sound
like a broken record!

01:10:26.765 --> 01:10:29.184
There's no need for you
to be like my brother.

01:10:29.309 --> 01:10:32.771
Just be yourself and try your best.
That's more than enough.

01:10:33.063 --> 01:10:34.105
Yo...

01:10:34.773 --> 01:10:36.942
Yoko, nicely said...

01:10:37.108 --> 01:10:40.487
You dummy. You said that
to me, don't you remember?

01:10:40.654 --> 01:10:42.906
When I stopped going to school,
my mum told me

01:10:43.114 --> 01:10:45.659
that I was quite
different from my brother.

01:10:46.117 --> 01:10:49.162
And you said
it was okay for me to be myself.

01:10:49.371 --> 01:10:51.998
I'm not like my brother who put
effort into everything.

01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:54.167
And I'm no good at fitting in with others.

01:10:55.543 --> 01:10:59.673
But because of what you said,
I figured that was okay.

01:11:00.048 --> 01:11:01.967
You put my mind at ease with those words.

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.261
And I managed to go back to school!

01:11:04.636 --> 01:11:07.430
You were the one that saved me, Wasabi!

01:11:09.057 --> 01:11:10.600
My words did that...?

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.437
Maybe I can save people, then...

01:11:17.399 --> 01:11:21.236
Thank you, Yoko.
I'll give it my best, after all!

01:11:23.697 --> 01:11:25.532
My shift's about to start, so I'm going.

01:11:25.824 --> 01:11:29.035
You can have the rest of the coffee,
just bring the stuff back to the café.

01:11:33.915 --> 01:11:37.252
I've been in love with you since that day!

01:11:37.419 --> 01:11:39.713
I love you more than anyone!

01:11:41.006 --> 01:11:44.592
Give it your best, you big idiot!

01:11:54.686 --> 01:11:59.733
Call for help, alert the emergency
services, and take the AED with you.

01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:03.486
First, check if they're conscious by
calling out and seeing if they respond.

01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.988
Can you hear me?

01:12:05.905 --> 01:12:07.073
Can you hear me?

01:12:07.866 --> 01:12:09.117
Can you hear me?

01:12:09.576 --> 01:12:12.704
No response.
Next, check to see if they're breathing.

01:12:12.871 --> 01:12:13.997
Chest compressions.

01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:19.252
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten...

01:12:19.461 --> 01:12:22.130
Hands one on top of the other,
applying force, using your body weight.

01:12:22.297 --> 01:12:25.175
Adults require at least thirty
5 cm-deep compressions.

01:12:25.342 --> 01:12:28.011
Remember to wait until the chest has
risen before each compression.

01:12:28.178 --> 01:12:29.804
Twenty-nine, thirty...

01:12:29.971 --> 01:12:32.557
Raise their chin and pinch their nose,
supporting the air duct.

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:36.519
One breath per second is optimal.

01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:41.733
Once again. Just make sure their chest
is expanding when you do this.

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:44.110
After that, begin compressions again.

01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:46.112
Five, six, seven...

01:12:46.279 --> 01:12:48.281
Thirty. That's the pattern.

01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:50.408
Right. Someone else have a go.

01:12:50.825 --> 01:12:52.035
Miss Mukaimizu?

01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:00.627
One, two, three, four...

01:13:00.794 --> 01:13:04.631
–You might be pressing a bit too hard.
– <i>"The ribs have been broken."</i>

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:07.509
Remember not to press too hard.
About 5 cm is plenty.

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:10.011
Let's try mouth-to-mouth, next.

01:13:20.522 --> 01:13:21.773
Miss Mukaimizu?

01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:23.525
Miss Mukaimizu!

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:36.704
The water...

01:13:38.623 --> 01:13:40.375
I mustn't!

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:46.840
You send 'em flying off the roof like they
do for New Year's in Taiwan and Shanghai.

01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:48.007
Really?

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:51.928
We goofed up last time, so this time
we've got us a pro with fireworks.

01:13:52.178 --> 01:13:54.681
–You'll need earplugs, though.
–Sounds like a blast!

01:13:54.848 --> 01:13:57.851
Minoru got caught by the fuzz,
but this guy ran away.

01:13:58.059 --> 01:13:59.727
You just left him there?

01:13:59.894 --> 01:14:03.690
It's because I didn't get caught that
I can put on this year's display...

01:14:03.857 --> 01:14:06.860
You should be praising me,
you silly girl.

01:14:07.444 --> 01:14:08.736
You want me to applaud?

01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:11.072
There's this great, run-down old building.

01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:13.074
Ost? That's super famous.

01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:15.368
It's where they had
the world's biggest Christmas tree.

01:14:15.535 --> 01:14:17.120
That tree's still there, you know.

01:14:17.287 --> 01:14:18.705
It really is huge.

01:14:18.872 --> 01:14:20.498
So, that's where we'll be launching
them from.

01:14:20.665 --> 01:14:24.127
–Awesome, that sounds so fun.
–I'm pretty excited. I'm going!

01:14:24.294 --> 01:14:27.130
–I'm totally fried up!
–Don't you mean "fired up"?

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:30.091
–<i>Let's get out of here.</i>
–<i>I'm so excited.</i>

01:14:30.884 --> 01:14:32.135
<i>It's my first time, you know.</i>

01:14:32.302 --> 01:14:34.262
<i>It's so loud, you'll pee your pants!</i>

01:14:34.429 --> 01:14:36.556
<i>You can't hear a thing afterwards.</i>

01:14:36.723 --> 01:14:38.183
<i>I don't have any earplugs.</i>

01:14:38.349 --> 01:14:39.767
<i>No worries baby,
I've got plenty to go round.</i>

01:14:39.934 --> 01:14:41.895
–Hi, Yoko...
–Shush!

01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:05.668
Boss, I'm punching out early, today.

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:07.462
Yoko?

01:15:08.379 --> 01:15:10.423
You know how a year ago,
some fireworks caused

01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:12.342
a building under construction
to go up in flames.

01:15:12.509 --> 01:15:15.553
Yeah. I was living in the building
next to it that caught fire.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:17.222
What? Really?

01:15:17.972 --> 01:15:19.933
It looks like these guys
were the perpetrators.

01:15:20.225 --> 01:15:22.477
They were talking about
launching more fireworks.

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:25.605
They said they'd set them off
at the OST, where those ruins are.

01:15:25.772 --> 01:15:28.233
That place that had the biggest
Christmas tree in the world?

01:15:28.858 --> 01:15:31.152
Damn it... Wasabi's not answering.

01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:33.821
I heard them say
they'll break in to do it.

01:15:33.988 --> 01:15:35.823
It'll be an illegal party this time, too.

01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:41.538
Yoko, this is serious.
We should call the police.

01:15:46.751 --> 01:15:49.504
–Quit touching!
–I'm just making sure you don't fall.

01:15:50.088 --> 01:15:52.173
Yoko. I'm going to call the cops.

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:55.552
We need proof first. I'm gonna
take pictures of these jerks.

01:16:01.766 --> 01:16:02.809
Yoko!

01:16:06.104 --> 01:16:07.105
Yoko.

01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:09.065
Yoko...

01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:14.529
Whoa, this tree's huge.

01:16:15.446 --> 01:16:16.781
Looks pretty dead, though.

01:16:18.992 --> 01:16:21.244
–Yoko, wait!
–Shh!

01:16:29.043 --> 01:16:30.336
There's a pool.

01:16:33.006 --> 01:16:37.510
–Nice view!
–Happy times!

01:16:37.677 --> 01:16:39.721
The view at night from
up here is the best!

01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:41.472
Amazing...

01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:43.474
We're so high up!

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.525
Stop scaring me!

01:16:52.692 --> 01:16:54.652
We'll set 'em off from right here. Boom!

01:16:55.069 --> 01:16:56.321
Us too!

01:16:56.487 --> 01:16:58.573
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

01:16:59.198 --> 01:17:02.619
–Quit it!
–What are you doing?

01:17:02.869 --> 01:17:06.247
Alright, grab a firework
and get ready for launch, people!

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:15.048
I can't make out their faces.

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:16.466
It's too dark.

01:17:16.633 --> 01:17:17.884
This is plenty of evidence.

01:17:18.051 --> 01:17:19.927
I want a video of them
actually setting them off.

01:17:30.355 --> 01:17:32.899
–Fireworks...
–Are we facing Katsuura, I wonder...

01:17:34.442 --> 01:17:35.360
Oh, no!

01:17:47.705 --> 01:17:49.415
Awesome!

01:17:50.917 --> 01:17:52.835
And here's another! Boom!

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:54.837
And another! Boom!

01:17:55.213 --> 01:17:56.714
Have it! Boom!

01:17:58.424 --> 01:17:59.258
This is crazy!

01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:07.600
Hey. Watch what yer doin'!
Put it out, put it out!

01:18:07.767 --> 01:18:09.102
–What?
–This is bad.

01:18:09.268 --> 01:18:12.522
–This is really bad!
–What? What's going on?

01:18:12.689 --> 01:18:13.940
Fire!

01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:17.026
–Eh?
–Right, let's scram.

01:18:17.318 --> 01:18:21.864
Hey! You know you're not supposed to be
setting off fireworks here, right!

01:18:22.115 --> 01:18:25.118
–What? Can't hear ya!
–Like we care, dummy!

01:18:25.785 --> 01:18:28.037
–That firework burned me...
–Yoko, let's get out of here!

01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:34.961
The way we came in is blocked.
We've no choice but to jump.

01:18:38.923 --> 01:18:40.299
My leg hurts real bad!

01:18:49.267 --> 01:18:51.060
YOKO HINAGESHI: MISSED CALL
YOKO: I'M WITH HINAKO...

01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:54.731
What?

01:18:56.607 --> 01:18:58.025
<i>Reports of a fire in the Nagakawa area.</i>

01:18:58.192 --> 01:19:00.486
<i>At 20-9, 3 Choume, Nishikubo, Nagakawa.</i>

01:19:00.862 --> 01:19:02.530
Mr. Yamashiro! East of the OST...

01:19:02.697 --> 01:19:05.742
The hydrant's been moved 30 meters south
of the new mansion block!

01:19:05.908 --> 01:19:07.493
–You're sure?
–I am!

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:09.370
A girl I love is in trouble!

01:19:09.537 --> 01:19:11.164
Say what?

01:19:11.664 --> 01:19:13.666
We can't get a ladder up that building.

01:19:13.833 --> 01:19:16.878
And if that big tree catches fire, it'll
turn the place into a blazing inferno.

01:19:25.052 --> 01:19:27.388
There it is! Thank God
no one's parked on the street.

01:19:28.973 --> 01:19:30.308
Fireworks, again?

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.144
Grab the hose. We'll have to climb
as far as we can.

01:19:33.478 --> 01:19:34.937
–There's no lift here.
–Roger!

01:19:35.354 --> 01:19:37.982
Search for 252s on the 15th
and other floors!

01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:38.983
Yes, sir!

01:19:40.985 --> 01:19:44.322
The steel door is locked.
Use the cutter to get in there.

01:19:46.908 --> 01:19:48.785
How did they get in there?

01:19:49.952 --> 01:19:53.206
Seems they entered the building using
a ladder on the east side. We're going in.

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:56.918
Is anyone there?

01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:58.753
Shout if you hear us!

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:07.178
I'm on the 15th floor! Too many fireworks
are going off. I can't go further.

01:20:07.345 --> 01:20:09.096
I can't climb further! Over!

01:20:10.056 --> 01:20:12.517
Shit! Put your face guard down!

01:20:14.644 --> 01:20:17.104
–Captain, we've got no water!
–What?

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:20.483
I'm going to check it out.
Wait here!

01:20:22.235 --> 01:20:24.111
Safety of those who
raised the alarm, unconfirmed.

01:20:24.278 --> 01:20:27.573
The 14th floor and 15th floor stairwell
are in flames due to fireworks.

01:20:27.782 --> 01:20:29.951
No other 252s on any other floors.

01:20:30.117 --> 01:20:33.079
Reports indicate 10 people on the rooftop
at the time of the incident.

01:20:33.204 --> 01:20:34.163
We're looking for them!

01:21:04.277 --> 01:21:08.155
It's okay, I got a call out to the fire
department, they're downstairs right now.

01:21:08.281 --> 01:21:10.241
They'll be here to save us, any minute.

01:21:13.911 --> 01:21:16.789
<i>If I call for Minato now,
he might disappear forever...</i>

01:21:18.165 --> 01:21:19.500
<i>I'll never see him again.</i>

01:21:20.835 --> 01:21:22.753
<i>Call out for me whenever you need me.</i>

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:25.047
<i>I can't! If I do that, you'll...</i>

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:28.551
Big brother...

01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:33.472
<i>Minato will never be able to pass on
if you stay like this, Hinako!</i>

01:21:34.515 --> 01:21:36.684
<i>What Minato wants...</i>

01:21:36.934 --> 01:21:41.022
<i>Until you're able to ride your waves.
Call to me, whenever you need me.</i>

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:51.782
<i>The water I see you looking out on</i>

01:21:51.949 --> 01:21:56.203
Shimmers ever so brilliantly in the light.

01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:58.456
<i>Hinako. Thank you for calling out to me.</i>

01:21:58.623 --> 01:21:59.624
Minato!

01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:03.044
<i>My wish came true, and I got to stay here.</i>

01:22:03.502 --> 01:22:06.881
<i>My wish was that you would be
able to ride the waves.</i>

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:08.257
<i>Until you can...</i>

01:22:08.466 --> 01:22:10.009
–<i>ride the waves.</i>
–ride the waves.

01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:33.366
What's going on?

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:06.315
<i>You've really improved.</i>

01:23:06.899 --> 01:23:08.109
Minato...?

01:23:09.193 --> 01:23:11.445
<i>I'm proud to call you my junior.</i>

01:23:11.612 --> 01:23:14.365
<i>There are only two of them
on the upper floor. Leave it to me.</i>

01:23:14.782 --> 01:23:16.867
Minato!

01:23:31.757 --> 01:23:33.467
The remaining fireworks aren't igniting.

01:23:33.676 --> 01:23:37.430
The tree's flames are being doused by a
body of water going up the central column.

01:23:37.638 --> 01:23:39.849
How it's happening... I don't know.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.857
Yoko. We're going inside the water
but don't worry, it's safe.

01:23:48.107 --> 01:23:49.984
Your big brother is here, too.

01:23:54.113 --> 01:23:56.157
<i>How's my little blue-ringed octopus?</i>

01:23:57.033 --> 01:23:59.827
<i>Big bro. It really is you...</i>

01:24:00.369 --> 01:24:02.538
<i>Say hi to Mom and Dad for me.</i>

01:24:03.122 --> 01:24:04.707
<i>No fair.</i>

01:24:16.427 --> 01:24:18.637
Yoko! Over here.

01:24:33.235 --> 01:24:34.070
Right!

01:24:35.154 --> 01:24:36.280
Left.

01:24:42.078 --> 01:24:43.287
Right.

01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:45.289
Left.

01:24:45.456 --> 01:24:47.583
More water's coming. Hold your breath.

01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:55.591
<i>Once the water has put out the whole
fire, it'll spill out like a giant wave.</i>

01:24:59.845 --> 01:25:02.056
<i>Once you're out,
you'll have to ride the wave!</i>

01:25:02.807 --> 01:25:04.642
<i>Yoko, you hold on tightly to the board.</i>

01:25:05.434 --> 01:25:06.852
<i>Get ready to come out the top!</i>

01:25:11.899 --> 01:25:12.900
<i>Not far now.</i>

01:25:13.275 --> 01:25:16.278
<i>One, two, three.</i>

01:25:24.203 --> 01:25:25.871
<i>Hinako, paddle, paddle!</i>

01:25:28.165 --> 01:25:29.667
–I'm ready!
–<i>Pop up!</i>

01:25:29.959 --> 01:25:31.335
<i>Ride the wave!</i>

01:26:58.797 --> 01:27:01.133
Thank you, Yoko.

01:27:34.541 --> 01:27:36.168
<i>Thank you, Hinako.</i>

01:27:39.129 --> 01:27:41.090
<i>You're my hero.</i>

01:27:49.807 --> 01:27:51.183
Hinako!

01:27:52.059 --> 01:27:53.560
I'm so glad you're safe.

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.214
Thank you for coming out on Christmas Day.

01:28:22.381 --> 01:28:25.175
We couldn't miss celebrating your
lifeguarding certification, could we?

01:28:25.676 --> 01:28:28.387
But are you sure you really
wanted omelet with rice for it?

01:28:28.721 --> 01:28:31.849
Omelet with rice was what
I got as a treat, when I was kid.

01:28:32.099 --> 01:28:34.935
I was never able to make it too well,

01:28:35.102 --> 01:28:39.481
but recently I've improved quite a bit.

01:28:39.648 --> 01:28:41.483
Wow! Amazing.

01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:43.694
Omelet with rice and a lifeguard certificate...

01:28:43.861 --> 01:28:45.696
Looks like you're finally
riding the waves, Hinako.

01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:49.575
Yep. What good is it being a surfer if
you can only ride the ocean waves.

01:28:49.742 --> 01:28:52.119
I think I'm getting the hang
of riding life's waves, too.

01:28:54.371 --> 01:28:56.582
I'm sure big bro is looking down smiling.

01:28:57.041 --> 01:28:58.625
That reminds me.

01:29:00.544 --> 01:29:01.420
4 MEN ARRESTED OVER "OST RUINS" FIRE

01:29:01.587 --> 01:29:03.005
They caught them!

01:29:03.422 --> 01:29:04.965
No more playing detective, okay?

01:29:05.132 --> 01:29:06.967
Okay already.

01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:08.969
Thanks for dinner.

01:29:09.136 --> 01:29:10.804
Not at all. Congratulations again.

01:29:10.971 --> 01:29:12.056
Well done!

01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:17.603
You know, inside Port Tower,

01:29:17.811 --> 01:29:19.772
there's a lovers' sanctuary you can visit.

01:29:19.938 --> 01:29:21.023
What's that?

01:29:21.231 --> 01:29:24.068
You can write a message on
a heart-shaped card and stuff.

01:29:24.568 --> 01:29:25.611
Sounds lame.

01:29:25.944 --> 01:29:27.446
Sounds romantic to me.

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:32.701
Well, if you want to go,
I don't mind playing along...

01:29:32.868 --> 01:29:34.536
You two should go!

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:35.954
You think?

01:29:37.122 --> 01:29:38.082
But...

01:29:38.582 --> 01:29:40.250
Don't worry about me, okay?

01:29:40.501 --> 01:29:43.295
–If you say so.
–We'll go check it out, then!

01:29:43.462 --> 01:29:44.797
Come on, Wasabi!

01:29:45.255 --> 01:29:47.216
See you later, Hinako.

01:29:47.424 --> 01:29:48.384
Happy New Year!

01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:50.511
Hinako, Merry Christmas!

01:29:50.719 --> 01:29:53.347
Not being in love
makes you act all stupid!

01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:07.778
The water I see you looking out on...

01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:19.248
<i>This message is from Minato Hinageshi</i>

01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:22.459
<i>going out to Hinako Mukaimizu.</i>

01:30:23.043 --> 01:30:25.587
<i>This is a contribution from last year.</i>

01:30:25.796 --> 01:30:26.713
NEXT YEAR'S CHRISTMAS MESSAGE BOX

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:28.006
<i>Hinako, Merry Christmas!</i>

01:30:28.257 --> 01:30:32.136
<i>Let's spend every Christmas together
from now on and forever.</i>

01:30:32.428 --> 01:30:35.889
<i>Forever and ever, and ever.</i>

01:30:36.932 --> 01:30:41.311
<i>This is a message for Tatsuya Shibasaki
from his whole family.</i>

01:30:41.478 --> 01:30:45.858
<i>Merry Christmas! What a year it's been,
but thank you for everything.</i>

01:30:46.066 --> 01:30:47.526
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

01:30:47.693 --> 01:30:51.572
<i>This is a message from Miyu Watanabe
for Koichi Watanabe.</i>

01:31:12.009 --> 01:31:13.135
Hi!

01:31:14.094 --> 01:31:17.222
There's a rip current around here,
so be careful, okay!

01:31:17.473 --> 01:31:19.099
Okay!

01:31:19.433 --> 01:31:20.976
That's Hinako.

01:31:25.397 --> 01:31:28.525
–I guess the waves are gone for today.
–Might as well bail.
