02:34.332 --> 02:37.901
- Yeah?
- Hi.

03:03.444 --> 03:04.778
They're in the cupboard.

03:11.452 --> 03:12.719
Keys is just...

03:19.260 --> 03:21.194
they'll be on the top.

03:21.195 --> 03:24.197
Just take 'em and fuck off.

04:00.134 --> 04:02.002
I want to know who else did it.

04:03.371 --> 04:05.038
I don't know.

04:07.575 --> 04:09.042
No?

04:09.043 --> 04:10.344
Jog your memory?

04:10.345 --> 04:14.514
I don't fucking know.

04:14.515 --> 04:16.315
I don't deal with the actors.

04:16.317 --> 04:17.784
You don't?

04:17.785 --> 04:19.719
No.

04:19.720 --> 04:20.853
No.

04:20.855 --> 04:21.788
No!

04:22.991 --> 04:24.191
Hey!

04:24.192 --> 04:25.525
Stop!

04:30.264 --> 04:32.532
Talk to finn.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.901
He knows.

04:34.902 --> 04:37.404
He runs the whole show.

04:37.405 --> 04:39.672
His number's in the teletext
over there.

04:47.648 --> 04:50.950
I already met up
with old mate finn.

04:50.951 --> 04:52.386
He told me a lot of things.

05:01.795 --> 05:04.164
How do you think
I wound up here?

05:08.736 --> 05:10.870
I swear to god,
I never touched her.

05:21.849 --> 05:23.616
Yeah, well, someone did.

05:29.390 --> 05:30.390
It wasn't me.

05:31.725 --> 05:32.926
It wasn't me.

05:32.927 --> 05:35.962
I just built the fuckin' set!

05:46.574 --> 05:47.674
No!

05:47.675 --> 05:48.741
No.

05:48.742 --> 05:50.343
Oh, shit!

05:50.344 --> 05:52.645
Hey!

05:55.383 --> 05:56.349
No!

07:17.498 --> 07:18.831
Can I take your order?

07:18.832 --> 07:19.999
Oh, yeah.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.637
I'll have the rump steak,
medium rare,

07:23.638 --> 07:25.605
with pepper sauce, thanks.

07:25.606 --> 07:26.973
Chips or veggies?

07:26.974 --> 07:30.943
Just veggies.

07:30.944 --> 07:32.812
Won't be long.

07:32.813 --> 07:35.014
Thanks.

07:38.052 --> 07:39.452
Are you going north?

07:39.453 --> 07:42.155
No, wrong way.

07:51.832 --> 07:54.534
I'm trying
to get to rockhampton.

07:56.704 --> 08:00.240
Sorry.

08:53.294 --> 08:56.363
I'll take you if you want.

08:56.364 --> 08:58.498
I thought you said
you couldn't.

08:58.499 --> 09:01.234
You want a ride or not?

09:04.805 --> 09:07.140
I've got one.

09:37.772 --> 09:39.773
You running from somewhere?

09:39.774 --> 09:42.208
I'm visiting a friend.

09:42.209 --> 09:43.376
A friend.

09:44.945 --> 09:46.279
How old are you?

09:46.280 --> 09:47.814
How old are you?

09:47.815 --> 09:49.683
I'm 44, and I don't want
to get pulled over

09:49.684 --> 09:51.217
with some underage runaway
in the car.

09:51.218 --> 09:52.251
Catch my drift?

09:54.221 --> 09:56.856
I'm 18, so you can relax.

09:56.857 --> 09:59.091
And I'm not running away.

09:59.092 --> 10:00.794
I just need
to get to rockhampton.

10:00.795 --> 10:04.731
Yeah, well,
I'll be passing through.

10:04.732 --> 10:05.665
Cool.

10:13.941 --> 10:17.877
It smells like a barbecue
in here.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.178
It's dinner.

10:19.179 --> 10:21.113
Pass it over.

10:35.062 --> 10:37.029
You want some?

10:38.532 --> 10:39.532
All right.

10:39.533 --> 10:41.968
I might just steal some veggies.

10:44.772 --> 10:47.106
So...

10:47.107 --> 10:49.075
Is this a business trip?

10:49.076 --> 10:52.211
Yeah.

10:52.212 --> 10:53.646
What sort of work do you do?

10:53.647 --> 10:57.250
Pest control.

10:57.251 --> 10:58.818
Oh.

10:58.819 --> 11:02.655
I usually just
sweep bugs outside,

11:02.656 --> 11:05.058
except for huntsman spiders.

11:05.059 --> 11:07.994
Can you pass me a napkin
from in the glove box?

11:18.039 --> 11:19.806
Who's this?

11:22.076 --> 11:24.077
My daughter.

11:24.078 --> 11:26.646
What's her name?

11:26.647 --> 11:30.550
Jesse.

11:30.551 --> 11:32.652
Does she live with you?

11:34.689 --> 11:37.290
You may want to take a seat.

11:56.010 --> 11:58.411
She was found lying on her back,

11:58.412 --> 11:59.813
which means when she vomited,

11:59.814 --> 12:03.583
the airways became blocked,
causing suffocation.

12:03.584 --> 12:08.454
The toxicology report found
alcohol, cocaine,

12:08.455 --> 12:11.257
and heroin in her blood.

12:11.258 --> 12:15.328
We also found traces of semen.

12:22.937 --> 12:25.005
Where did they find her?

12:25.006 --> 12:27.641
Thatcher's lane.

12:27.642 --> 12:31.911
Emergency services received an
anonymous call from a pay phone.

12:37.184 --> 12:39.218
Someone was with her.

12:39.219 --> 12:41.921
It appears so.

12:41.922 --> 12:45.258
But unfortunately, being
an industrial area on a sunday,

12:45.259 --> 12:49.462
we're finding it very difficult
to get a witness.

12:55.502 --> 12:57.102
¶ ¶

16:28.048 --> 16:30.016
hi, there. Can I help you?

16:30.017 --> 16:34.120
Yeah, I've come about
one of the videos you stock.

16:35.189 --> 16:37.357
Have you seen
our full catalogue?

16:37.358 --> 16:39.926
No, but this is the one
I'm really interested in.

16:39.927 --> 16:40.960
Okay.

16:40.961 --> 16:42.295
We usually do
most of our business

16:42.296 --> 16:43.396
through the mail or by phone,

16:43.397 --> 16:44.830
so in the future,
just give us a call.

16:44.831 --> 16:46.199
Sure.

16:46.200 --> 16:49.035
So this video,
how many do you have?

16:49.036 --> 16:50.770
Couple of hundred.

16:50.771 --> 16:52.138
Why, do you want 'em all?

16:52.139 --> 16:53.506
Yeah.

16:53.507 --> 16:54.540
You serious?

16:54.541 --> 16:57.576
Yeah, I wanted
every single copy.

16:57.577 --> 16:59.545
Jesus, how big's your store?

16:59.546 --> 17:01.814
I'm more of an agent.

17:01.815 --> 17:06.551
When I find a good movie,
I take it to the stores.

17:06.553 --> 17:07.819
Okay.

17:07.820 --> 17:09.021
Different way of doing things,

17:09.022 --> 17:12.758
but, hey, I'll take your money.

17:12.759 --> 17:15.828
We got 231 copies here.

17:15.829 --> 17:16.996
So you want 'em all?

17:16.997 --> 17:17.931
Yeah.

17:19.465 --> 17:26.638
Including gst,
you're looking at $2,656.50.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.273
You take credit?

17:28.275 --> 17:29.542
Sure do.

17:29.543 --> 17:31.177
Where do you want 'em
delivered?

17:31.178 --> 17:32.979
I'll grab 'em now,
if that's all right.

17:32.980 --> 17:35.114
No problem.

17:37.251 --> 17:41.287
Mick, can you bring out all the
copies we have of video 26160,

17:41.288 --> 17:42.956
young city sluts?

17:48.795 --> 17:50.930
Do you know the people
who made this?

17:50.931 --> 17:51.931
Sure do.

17:51.932 --> 17:53.933
Finn and I go way back.

17:53.934 --> 17:54.934
There's your order slip.

17:54.935 --> 17:56.269
Just show it to mick
on your way out.

17:58.272 --> 18:02.041
So finn, he's the producer?

18:02.042 --> 18:03.943
Well, I guess
you'd call him that.

18:03.944 --> 18:05.945
Spends most of his time
doing fight promotions.

18:05.946 --> 18:08.081
Actually, this video was shot
at one of his gyms.

18:08.082 --> 18:09.082
Really?

18:09.083 --> 18:10.316
Were you there
when they shot it?

18:13.053 --> 18:15.554
You often advise people
on those shoots.

18:15.555 --> 18:17.190
Imagine being so close,
you can smell it.

18:22.329 --> 18:24.563
I want to get in touch
with finn, you know,

18:24.564 --> 18:25.798
see what else he's got.

18:25.799 --> 18:26.966
Yeah, I could organize that.

18:26.967 --> 18:29.168
It'll all be
in our back catalogs.

18:29.169 --> 18:33.239
Well, I'm also interested
in commissioning some work.

18:33.240 --> 18:36.242
Yeah, he's talented,
ain't he, old finn?

18:36.243 --> 18:37.477
Let me grab your postal address

18:37.478 --> 18:39.612
so I can put you
on our mailing list.

18:39.613 --> 18:42.482
No, I'd really like
to contact him.

18:42.483 --> 18:44.250
I got some great ideas.

18:44.251 --> 18:45.818
Don't we all, mate?

18:45.819 --> 18:47.953
I just can't give out
his details.

18:47.954 --> 18:49.022
Let me give him a call.

18:49.023 --> 18:50.056
He can contact you.

18:59.833 --> 19:01.834
Write down the address.

19:04.037 --> 19:06.906
Give me the address.

19:26.894 --> 19:29.661
I want his home address,
not a p.O. Box.

19:29.662 --> 19:31.030
I don't have it.

19:31.031 --> 19:33.966
Then tell me where his gym is.

19:50.417 --> 19:52.018
Who else fucked her?

19:52.019 --> 19:53.452
What?

19:54.788 --> 19:57.189
In the video,

19:57.190 --> 19:58.424
there's three of them,

19:58.425 --> 20:00.226
but the cops tell me
there were four involved.

20:00.227 --> 20:02.361
The cops?

20:02.362 --> 20:03.963
What have you told 'em?

20:03.964 --> 20:06.198
Who was it?

20:06.199 --> 20:07.666
You?

20:07.667 --> 20:09.135
This finn?

20:09.136 --> 20:11.470
Someone else?

20:11.471 --> 20:13.572
I wouldn't have a clue.

20:18.345 --> 20:20.046
Did she smell good?

20:20.047 --> 20:22.481
What?

20:25.285 --> 20:28.720
Did she smell good?

22:43.290 --> 22:45.257
There's a pot down there.

22:46.893 --> 22:49.695
It's an urn.

22:50.897 --> 22:53.065
Really?

22:53.066 --> 22:54.600
Yeah.

22:56.303 --> 22:59.405
My daughter's in there...

22:59.406 --> 23:01.474
half of her, anyway.

23:04.077 --> 23:06.278
My wife has the rest of her.

23:08.648 --> 23:10.682
How did she...

23:10.683 --> 23:14.220
Heroin.

23:14.221 --> 23:15.588
That's awful.

23:17.157 --> 23:20.426
Are you gonna
scatter her somewhere?

23:20.427 --> 23:23.862
I don't know yet.

23:59.732 --> 24:00.899
Yeah, right.

24:02.835 --> 24:03.835
Yeah.

24:03.836 --> 24:04.836
All right, finn.

24:04.837 --> 24:07.072
All right, take care, man.

24:23.690 --> 24:28.227
I want you to tell me
about jessica fortesky,

24:28.228 --> 24:30.362
the girl in the video.

24:31.598 --> 24:33.599
How did she get involved?

24:33.600 --> 24:35.901
I told you, she came to me.

24:35.902 --> 24:37.570
She just wanted to make
some extra dosh.

24:37.571 --> 24:39.171
How much was she worth?

24:39.172 --> 24:42.441
Why don't you ask her?

24:44.377 --> 24:46.412
Because she's dead.

24:48.515 --> 24:50.048
How?

24:50.049 --> 24:52.351
Heroin, but you already
know that!

24:52.352 --> 24:53.719
Fuck off!

24:53.720 --> 24:56.188
I've been in this fucking
business for 20 years!

24:56.189 --> 25:00.158
You think I'd still be around
if I drugged my actors, eh?

25:00.159 --> 25:01.893
Look at her,
for christ's sakes!

25:01.894 --> 25:03.195
You think I wanted her
like that?

25:03.196 --> 25:05.497
Then why did you shoot her?

25:05.498 --> 25:09.501
Because it's
fucking expensive, yeah?

25:09.502 --> 25:11.837
Look, no one had
a problem with it.

25:11.838 --> 25:14.273
Someone called an ambulance
for her

25:14.274 --> 25:17.676
and left her
in a fucking alleyway to die!

25:17.677 --> 25:19.678
And you fucking think
it was one of us, eh?

25:19.679 --> 25:23.415
You think we fuckin'
were all involved in it, eh?

25:23.416 --> 25:24.916
Tell you what, mate.

25:24.917 --> 25:28.287
She came here stoned
off her fucking tits, yeah?

25:28.288 --> 25:29.688
She did what she had to do,
you hear?

25:29.689 --> 25:31.323
All that rootin', yeah?

25:31.324 --> 25:35.494
Collected her money
and buggered off all by herself.

25:38.298 --> 25:41.333
You think we fuckin'
had anything to hide, eh?

25:41.334 --> 25:43.902
Do you think
if we had anything to hide,

25:43.903 --> 25:46.004
we'd be making fuckin' hundreds
of videos,

25:46.005 --> 25:48.039
sending it around the world?

25:48.040 --> 25:50.376
Do you think so, eh?

25:50.377 --> 25:53.445
You think I'm gonna do that
if we fuckin' bumped her off?

25:54.547 --> 25:58.417
Fuckin' hell.

25:58.418 --> 26:00.319
Look.

26:00.320 --> 26:01.320
Just let me out of this.

26:01.321 --> 26:02.321
It's not your fault.

26:02.322 --> 26:03.989
I know. You're feeling cranky.

26:11.898 --> 26:13.832
You're her dad, I know,
or what are you?

26:13.833 --> 26:15.334
Fuckin' uncle, whatever.

26:17.470 --> 26:18.937
Look, my kids
were just the same.

26:18.938 --> 26:21.607
They just wouldn't have
the bother of it either.

26:25.412 --> 26:28.013
I want you to tell me
the names and addresses

26:28.014 --> 26:30.482
of everyone involved,
starting with the actors.

26:30.483 --> 26:34.853
Look, mate, you ain't gonna
get anywhere with this bullshit.

26:34.854 --> 26:37.155
Forget about it, eh?

26:37.156 --> 26:39.558
Look, no one did anything wrong.

26:49.469 --> 26:51.603
Stay fucking still.

27:05.284 --> 27:07.753
Stay fucking still.

27:50.296 --> 27:51.797
You like football?

28:01.274 --> 28:03.208
Take a deep breath.

28:16.255 --> 28:18.189
Christ! You fuckin' bastard!

28:18.190 --> 28:19.391
You're gonna die for this!

28:19.392 --> 28:21.393
You want more? You want more?

28:21.394 --> 28:23.495
All right!

28:23.496 --> 28:26.498
Jimmy, he come from up north
in gladstone.

28:26.499 --> 28:27.633
Yes, I know.

28:31.270 --> 28:32.771
What about the other ones?

28:35.107 --> 28:36.608
All right, all right,
all right.

28:36.609 --> 28:40.378
Fuckin' paul, he said he drived
down from mackay or something.

28:40.379 --> 28:41.680
Look, in my phone.

28:41.681 --> 28:43.381
It's in the fucking...
on my pants there.

28:43.382 --> 28:44.450
Just look in there.

28:44.451 --> 28:45.951
All the phone numbers
are in there.

28:45.952 --> 28:48.720
Go on, have a look.

28:55.462 --> 28:57.863
It's under paul lynchip.

28:59.732 --> 29:01.166
You gonna fuck off now?

29:01.167 --> 29:02.167
You got what you wanted.

29:02.168 --> 29:03.602
I want the other one.

29:03.603 --> 29:05.303
What about the other one?

29:05.304 --> 29:06.371
I don't fuckin' know.

29:06.372 --> 29:07.773
I never dealt with him.

29:07.774 --> 29:08.874
He's jim's brother.

29:08.875 --> 29:10.776
He's his little brother
or something.

29:10.777 --> 29:14.546
You want him, just go
and fuckin' ask jim, all right?

29:14.547 --> 29:17.549
And what about the tapes
you shot on?

29:17.550 --> 29:20.586
All right,
a bloke called walters, right?

29:20.587 --> 29:22.420
He lives in ipswich;
His number's in there too.

29:22.421 --> 29:23.421
Now fuck off!

29:23.422 --> 29:24.456
Thank you. Thank you.

29:24.457 --> 29:26.625
- Thank you.
- All right, yeah, yeah.

29:26.626 --> 29:27.726
You're welcome. Fuck off.

29:27.727 --> 29:30.061
No, no, no.

29:30.062 --> 29:31.663
Now I want to know
who else did her.

29:38.705 --> 29:40.706
Kill this piece
of fucking shit!

30:13.540 --> 30:15.240
Hey, finn.

30:15.241 --> 30:16.241
You all right, man?

30:16.242 --> 30:17.976
Oh, yeah, just fuckin' peachy.

30:17.977 --> 30:20.546
I just got a bike pump
stuck in me dick!

30:20.547 --> 30:22.447
Now, bring that fuckin' cunt
in here!

30:52.378 --> 30:53.845
You like that?

30:53.846 --> 30:55.313
Huh?

31:28.547 --> 31:30.616
Oh, shit.

31:30.617 --> 31:31.549
Oh, shit.

32:25.605 --> 32:29.107
I apologize in advance
if I start snoring.

32:29.108 --> 32:30.208
Whatever.

32:30.209 --> 32:32.310
As long as you don't
sleep naked.

32:36.281 --> 32:39.718
Mind if I put the telly
on live for a while?

32:39.719 --> 32:42.253
Helps me sleep.

32:42.254 --> 32:44.255
Yeah, that's cool.

32:44.256 --> 32:46.525
I do that at home.

32:52.464 --> 32:54.465
Developments in
a fatal house fire today

32:54.466 --> 32:57.035
as investigators believe
arson is to blame.

32:57.036 --> 32:59.237
The revelation came
as authorities uncovered

32:59.238 --> 33:02.707
a pornographic video operation
inside the residence.

33:02.708 --> 33:05.143
The enterprise was linked
with two other businesses

33:05.144 --> 33:07.178
where three men were murdered
earlier this week.

33:07.179 --> 33:09.581
The news is too depressing.

33:32.137 --> 33:33.271
Nothing on?

33:34.807 --> 33:36.775
Not really.

33:49.288 --> 33:51.322
I saw your arm.

33:56.228 --> 33:58.964
Why do you do that?

34:00.032 --> 34:02.701
I don't anymore.

34:05.905 --> 34:06.972
Why do you?

34:08.474 --> 34:11.710
I don't know.

34:11.710 --> 34:17.047
Most of the time,
I feel like I'm in a daze.

34:17.049 --> 34:22.386
Helps me feel something.

34:22.387 --> 34:23.855
I'm gonna have a shower.

34:25.424 --> 34:26.556
Oh, before I forget,

34:26.558 --> 34:29.960
I might have to visit
a client tomorrow.

34:29.962 --> 34:32.196
He lives nearby;
It won't take long.

34:32.197 --> 34:34.733
That's okay.

34:34.734 --> 34:36.101
I'll just sleep in.

35:47.690 --> 35:50.075
After we spoke on the phone,
I had a look around.

35:50.076 --> 35:51.609
If there's anywhere
they're gonna be,

35:51.610 --> 35:53.444
they'll be in these
old kennels here, I reckon.

35:53.445 --> 35:54.946
That's good thinking.

35:54.947 --> 35:57.515
I've been meaning to tear the
fucking things down for years.

36:18.503 --> 36:20.772
Oh, yeah.

36:20.773 --> 36:21.773
Here, take a look.

36:21.774 --> 36:23.174
Really?

37:03.082 --> 37:07.485
Jim?

37:07.486 --> 37:09.187
Jim?

37:28.140 --> 37:31.375
Oh, fuck.

37:44.890 --> 37:49.994
You were recently in
a porn shoot with my daughter.

37:49.995 --> 37:51.529
I want to know
who she left with.

37:53.299 --> 37:56.167
You're a fuckin' dead man!

37:58.904 --> 38:01.206
Who did she leave with?

38:03.342 --> 38:04.342
I don't know.

38:04.343 --> 38:05.609
She was still there
when I left.

38:13.485 --> 38:16.587
I don't fucking know.

38:21.593 --> 38:24.095
Who else was at the shoot?

38:28.100 --> 38:31.069
A producer, finn.

38:31.070 --> 38:32.204
Some cameraman.

38:32.205 --> 38:34.806
I didn't even know his name.

38:34.807 --> 38:37.475
And the guy
that owned the warehouse.

38:39.812 --> 38:41.646
Which one of them fucked her?

38:43.583 --> 38:45.850
I don't know.

38:45.851 --> 38:47.285
Probably finn.

38:58.331 --> 39:00.131
Where's your brother?

39:04.970 --> 39:07.905
You think I'm gonna
tell you that?

39:07.906 --> 39:09.140
Yes, I do, actually.

39:09.141 --> 39:10.842
Listen, listen.

39:10.843 --> 39:14.212
Your daughter came to the shoot
by herself, mate.

39:14.213 --> 39:18.450
No one forced her
to do nothing.

39:18.451 --> 39:22.086
No one forced her
to do nothing.

39:22.087 --> 39:25.490
No one fucking forced her
to do nothing!

39:25.491 --> 39:29.361
You raped her!

39:29.362 --> 39:31.095
What's wrong? You afraid?

39:31.096 --> 39:34.132
Come on, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

39:35.268 --> 39:37.669
Nothing to be afraid of.

39:37.670 --> 39:40.639
It's just a little cut.

39:40.640 --> 39:44.476
Look.

39:44.477 --> 39:46.978
Tiny little cut!

39:48.547 --> 39:51.215
Now it's your turn.

39:51.216 --> 39:52.550
Which one?

39:52.551 --> 39:55.553
Left or right?

39:55.554 --> 39:56.588
Fuck you!

39:56.589 --> 40:00.191
Tell me where
to find your brother!

40:00.192 --> 40:01.192
Speak!

40:01.193 --> 40:03.662
He lives down the road.

40:03.663 --> 40:05.597
Shut your fucking hole, irene!

40:14.106 --> 40:17.975
Chantam road, number 64.

40:17.976 --> 40:20.011
He's coming over here soon.

40:33.659 --> 40:37.195
You're mr. Fortesky,
aren't you?

40:37.196 --> 40:38.363
Who are you?

40:38.364 --> 40:41.733
Irene, his wife.

40:44.970 --> 40:46.471
You sent the video.

40:46.472 --> 40:49.374
Yeah.

40:49.375 --> 40:50.575
Why?

40:50.576 --> 40:51.810
What'd you think I'd do?

40:51.811 --> 40:53.478
I don't know.

40:53.479 --> 40:56.715
I was hoping
something like this.

41:08.994 --> 41:13.698
That video turned up
in the post one day.

41:13.699 --> 41:18.536
I didn't know what it was,
so I sat down and watched it.

41:19.638 --> 41:22.273
Then I saw her face
in the paper.

41:22.274 --> 41:27.078
They're pigs,
him and his fucking brother.

41:35.187 --> 41:38.022
You better go.

41:38.023 --> 41:40.258
Come back later
and call the police.

42:08.020 --> 42:11.389
This okay?

42:11.390 --> 42:13.257
Fine.

42:26.004 --> 42:27.605
Get him!

43:33.305 --> 43:34.238
Get him!

43:52.357 --> 43:53.391
Fuck!

44:13.278 --> 44:16.014
Oh, no!

44:16.015 --> 44:19.417
Eddy.

44:21.587 --> 44:23.154
Eddy!

44:25.958 --> 44:29.694
Eddy!

44:29.695 --> 44:31.696
Eddy!

45:53.946 --> 45:55.980
He'll be here in about an hour.

46:03.188 --> 46:04.889
Have you got a light?

46:41.660 --> 46:43.094
You know,
when I started smoking,

46:43.095 --> 46:45.429
I was the coolest
son of a bitch in school.

46:47.866 --> 46:52.469
Not till 20 years later
you think about quitting.

46:52.470 --> 46:54.939
By then your teeth are yellow,
you smell like shit,

46:54.940 --> 46:57.274
and they got you by the balls.

47:14.492 --> 47:18.796
So how long you planning
to stay up here?

47:18.797 --> 47:22.666
Don't know.

47:22.667 --> 47:24.335
Just promise me
next time I come through,

47:24.336 --> 47:28.172
I don't see you working here
with eight kids.

47:28.173 --> 47:32.243
I'm not planning
on having kids for a long time.

47:33.645 --> 47:36.748
I remember thinking that.

47:36.749 --> 47:38.716
Then one day,
me girlfriend gives me a call,

47:38.717 --> 47:40.785
tells me she's pregnant.

47:40.786 --> 47:42.820
What did you do?

47:42.821 --> 47:44.756
I married her.

47:47.826 --> 47:51.229
It must suck for guys.

47:51.230 --> 47:52.830
Jeez, I haven't heard
that before

47:52.831 --> 47:56.300
from a member
of the female race.

47:56.301 --> 47:58.169
Well, you have no choice.

47:58.170 --> 48:00.671
If she wants it,
she's having it.

48:09.748 --> 48:12.183
Well, that's him.

48:16.088 --> 48:17.521
Well, it's been nice
meeting you.

48:19.291 --> 48:21.425
You too.

48:21.426 --> 48:23.560
I hope everything works out.

48:33.772 --> 48:34.705
Alice.

48:42.380 --> 48:44.415
It's got my mobile on it,

48:44.416 --> 48:46.184
just in case.

48:46.185 --> 48:48.319
Thanks, christian.

50:13.305 --> 50:15.072
Say "bye-bye."

50:15.073 --> 50:16.073
Bye-bye.

50:28.620 --> 50:30.821
I don't know.
It could've been any of them.

50:30.822 --> 50:33.457
I didn't hang around;
I just left.

50:33.458 --> 50:35.426
Oh, you left too?

50:35.427 --> 50:36.760
Yeah.

50:36.761 --> 50:39.797
Yeah, you can even see me
walk out in the video.

50:39.798 --> 50:42.066
If you don't believe me,
I'll put it on.

50:42.067 --> 50:43.200
I'll show you.

50:43.201 --> 50:46.337
And what made you
suddenly leave?

50:46.338 --> 50:48.139
What?

50:48.140 --> 50:50.741
I went there because I thought
it'd be a bit of fun.

50:50.742 --> 50:53.677
And then when I saw otherwise,
I left.

50:53.678 --> 50:56.480
And what did you see?

50:56.481 --> 50:58.515
It was just the way that finn
kept directing us.

50:58.516 --> 51:01.152
He kept saying,
"be rougher on her.

51:01.153 --> 51:03.787
Keep everyone at once
going on her."

51:03.788 --> 51:04.788
The other guys loved it,

51:04.789 --> 51:07.992
but I just walked out.

51:07.993 --> 51:10.761
You left her with them.

51:10.762 --> 51:12.096
No.

51:12.097 --> 51:14.298
No, no, no,
I had words with finn.

51:14.299 --> 51:16.000
I told him that it wasn't right.

51:16.001 --> 51:17.835
And what did he say?

51:17.836 --> 51:20.471
He said,
"that's why she's getting paid."

51:35.787 --> 51:38.122
Did you talk to her at all?

51:39.291 --> 51:41.558
A little.

51:44.062 --> 51:47.431
Did she say why?

51:47.432 --> 51:48.432
Why what?

51:48.433 --> 51:49.733
Why she was there.

51:52.337 --> 51:53.971
No.

51:53.972 --> 51:57.408
No, it was a quick introduction.

51:57.409 --> 52:00.244
There were drinks going around.

52:00.245 --> 52:03.414
Finn was bringing around
lines of coke.

52:03.415 --> 52:06.117
Everyone was getting fucked up.

52:06.118 --> 52:08.486
And she had some.

52:08.487 --> 52:11.822
Yeah, finn was encouraging her.

52:13.625 --> 52:15.426
Why?

52:17.362 --> 52:19.963
I think she had her doubts.

52:19.964 --> 52:22.166
Something about it
not being about...

52:22.167 --> 52:26.637
hang on, hang on.

52:26.638 --> 52:28.272
Was she stoned
when she got there?

52:30.375 --> 52:32.709
No, not that I could tell.

52:32.710 --> 52:34.278
I don't know.

52:34.279 --> 52:36.947
Then when did she take
the heroin?

52:38.783 --> 52:40.884
Heroin?

52:43.188 --> 52:45.822
That must have been
when she disappeared with derek.

52:45.823 --> 52:47.758
Who the fuck is derek?

52:47.759 --> 52:49.493
Hehe works with finn.

52:49.494 --> 52:50.827
And she went somewhere
with him.

52:50.828 --> 52:53.597
Yeah, she... she looked like
she was gonna walk off,

52:53.598 --> 52:57.401
so he... so he took her in a room,
and then, I don't know.

52:57.402 --> 52:59.836
They were in there for a while.

52:59.837 --> 53:03.774
When she came out, she...
she didn't say anything.

53:03.775 --> 53:06.477
She looked all over the place.

53:06.478 --> 53:08.612
Do you think he might have...

53:08.613 --> 53:10.247
Forced himself?

53:11.849 --> 53:13.650
I don't know.

53:13.651 --> 53:15.519
Yeah, maybe.

53:15.520 --> 53:16.753
I don't... I don't know.

53:16.754 --> 53:19.856
They were in there long enough.

53:19.857 --> 53:21.625
And then what happened?

53:23.695 --> 53:25.129
Then

53:25.130 --> 53:28.899
then finn saw...
then finn saw her,

53:28.900 --> 53:30.367
and then he had words
with derek.

53:30.368 --> 53:33.537
He said... he said he didn't
want her looking all drunk

53:33.538 --> 53:36.039
and we had to shoot straightaway
before she passed out.

53:36.040 --> 53:37.708
Fuck! Stop!

53:37.709 --> 53:41.712
Where the fuck
can I find this derek?

53:41.713 --> 53:43.013
I don't know him.

53:43.014 --> 53:44.915
You don't know. You don't know!

53:44.916 --> 53:45.916
You don't know.

53:45.917 --> 53:47.184
You sure you don't know?

53:47.185 --> 53:48.185
I don't know him.

53:48.186 --> 53:49.953
You don't know, all right.

53:49.954 --> 53:51.021
Please, wait, wait, wait!

53:51.022 --> 53:52.423
I swear to god,
I don't know him.

53:52.424 --> 53:54.358
Talk to finn. Talk to finn.

53:54.359 --> 53:55.759
He's the only one
that knows derek.

53:55.760 --> 53:57.495
Finn's dead.

53:59.598 --> 54:01.732
Well, then...
then talk to the brothers.

54:01.733 --> 54:02.733
They knew him.

54:02.734 --> 54:03.934
Yeah, well, they're dead too.

54:03.935 --> 54:04.968
Wait, please!

54:04.969 --> 54:06.303
Do you think
I want to protect him?

54:06.304 --> 54:07.304
I don't.

54:07.305 --> 54:08.539
I just want to help you.
Please.

54:08.540 --> 54:10.674
You'd like to help?

54:19.251 --> 54:20.851
What do you expect me to do?

54:20.852 --> 54:23.754
You got to give something!

54:25.857 --> 54:27.258
Like what?

54:27.259 --> 54:30.060
What are you gonna do,
fight them all?

54:30.061 --> 54:33.164
She was there
because she chose to be.

54:33.165 --> 54:36.767
She fuckin' chose to be?

54:38.936 --> 54:42.039
She had no choice!

54:42.040 --> 54:44.341
No choice!

54:44.342 --> 54:47.811
Get up!

54:47.812 --> 54:48.812
Please, please.

54:48.813 --> 54:51.048
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

54:51.049 --> 54:52.216
Wait.

54:52.217 --> 54:53.317
You don't have to do this.

54:53.318 --> 54:55.186
You don't have to do this.

54:55.187 --> 54:56.587
You could just walk way.

54:56.588 --> 55:00.357
You could just walk away.

55:00.358 --> 55:02.459
You keep the videotape.

55:02.460 --> 55:04.428
You can blackmail me
for the rest of my life.

55:04.429 --> 55:06.096
I won't go to the police,
I promise.

55:06.097 --> 55:07.831
Please.

55:07.832 --> 55:10.301
I have a family.

55:10.302 --> 55:11.968
I have a family.

55:11.969 --> 55:15.005
Please, please.

55:15.006 --> 55:18.041
I have a little daughter.

55:18.042 --> 55:19.109
Please?

55:33.024 --> 55:35.626
So did I.

55:49.674 --> 55:52.610
She's dead.

55:57.415 --> 55:58.749
I know.

56:02.654 --> 56:04.955
No, you don't.

56:12.297 --> 56:15.699
She's dead.

56:20.138 --> 56:23.073
She's not up there
dancing around.

56:26.444 --> 56:27.444
She's a pile of dust.

56:27.445 --> 56:29.446
I can hold her in one hand.

56:34.452 --> 56:36.754
Still, it's better
than burying her.

56:41.859 --> 56:44.461
I couldn't bear the thought
of her tiny little body

56:44.462 --> 56:47.531
rotting in the ground.

58:42.080 --> 58:43.080
Hello?

58:43.081 --> 58:44.081
Hi, christian.

58:44.082 --> 58:45.848
It's alice.

58:45.849 --> 58:47.184
Alice.

58:47.185 --> 58:50.253
Are you driving back
to brisbane any time soon?

58:50.254 --> 58:52.422
Yeah, I'm... I'm heading back
right now.

58:52.423 --> 58:54.157
Have you gone past here yet?

58:54.158 --> 58:57.227
No, I'll be passing through
in about an hour.

58:57.228 --> 58:58.562
Do you think
I could catch a lift?

58:58.563 --> 58:59.829
Of course that's all right.

58:59.830 --> 59:01.931
I'm just at the petrol station.

59:01.932 --> 59:03.300
Okay.

59:03.301 --> 59:04.834
Well, wait for me there.

59:04.835 --> 59:06.769
Okay, thanks.

59:32.763 --> 59:35.298
Hi.

59:35.299 --> 59:36.466
You all right?

59:37.901 --> 59:41.471
Yeah.

59:52.250 --> 59:53.783
You're pregnant, aren't you?

59:57.321 --> 01:00:01.191
Ten weeks.

01:00:01.192 --> 01:00:02.526
When'd you find out?

01:00:02.527 --> 01:00:04.261
Monday.

01:00:07.898 --> 01:00:11.034
This guy in town,
he's the father?

01:00:16.541 --> 01:00:19.142
I want to get it sorted,

01:00:19.143 --> 01:00:21.778
but the longer you leave it,
the more expensive it gets,

01:00:21.779 --> 01:00:26.716
so I needed him to chip in.

01:00:26.717 --> 01:00:29.886
Did he come through?

01:00:29.887 --> 01:00:32.689
Stole a couple hundred bucks
from his brothers.

01:00:37.195 --> 01:00:38.995
Your parents know?

01:00:38.996 --> 01:00:40.630
Dad called me
a stupid little slut,

01:00:40.631 --> 01:00:46.002
and mom didn't say anything,
so fuck them both.

01:00:46.003 --> 01:00:49.472
Where are you planning
to go now?

01:00:49.473 --> 01:00:52.609
My friend kim
said I could stay a while,

01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:55.679
and I can get to school
with her.

01:00:59.517 --> 01:01:04.354
Well, if you want my two cents,

01:01:04.355 --> 01:01:06.289
you probably scared the shit
out of them already

01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:10.793
running away like this.

01:01:10.794 --> 01:01:16.266
I know it'll be hard to go back
and face them, but...

01:01:16.267 --> 01:01:21.204
I'm sure if you do,
they'll listen this time,

01:01:21.205 --> 01:01:26.008
make it right.

01:01:26.009 --> 01:01:28.278
They had their chance.

01:01:50.934 --> 01:01:54.738
Can I ask you something?

01:01:54.739 --> 01:01:58.775
What's it like having kids?

01:02:00.177 --> 01:02:03.413
It's scary...

01:02:03.414 --> 01:02:07.917
But worth it.

01:02:07.918 --> 01:02:11.187
I cried like a baby
when she was born.

01:02:11.188 --> 01:02:14.691
I didn't expect it.

01:02:14.692 --> 01:02:18.428
I don't know;
They fill you with something

01:02:18.429 --> 01:02:23.433
you never really knew you needed
or wanted.

01:02:23.434 --> 01:02:28.204
And no one will ever hug you
like your own kid

01:02:28.205 --> 01:02:31.641
when you come home
from work or...

01:02:31.642 --> 01:02:32.742
They hear a bump in the night.

01:02:32.743 --> 01:02:35.745
They come to you for protection.

01:02:35.746 --> 01:02:36.813
You give 'em a cuddle,

01:02:36.814 --> 01:02:38.214
and they go straight back
to sleep,

01:02:38.215 --> 01:02:40.850
'cause you're so strong...

01:02:40.851 --> 01:02:43.787
at least, they think you are.

01:02:45.823 --> 01:02:48.391
Makes you feel important.

01:02:50.561 --> 01:02:53.095
I remember thinking
I wanted to teach her

01:02:53.096 --> 01:02:55.398
all of life's little secrets,

01:02:55.399 --> 01:02:59.669
all those things I knew
and no one else did,

01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:03.406
warn her about boys.

01:03:03.407 --> 01:03:05.675
I never knew quite
what to expect from her,

01:03:05.676 --> 01:03:09.011
that's for sure.

01:03:09.012 --> 01:03:10.680
Sometimes she'd lock herself
in her room,

01:03:10.681 --> 01:03:12.649
wouldn't talk to anyone.

01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:15.485
She got that from me.

01:03:15.486 --> 01:03:21.057
Other times, she'd go crazy
and throw parties.

01:03:21.058 --> 01:03:24.427
She was such a little
drama queen.

01:03:24.428 --> 01:03:26.929
She got that from her mother.

01:03:31.168 --> 01:03:32.935
What really scares me,
though, is,

01:03:32.936 --> 01:03:37.874
I think she really felt alone.

01:03:40.878 --> 01:03:45.114
That's the worst thing
you can feel.

01:03:49.119 --> 01:03:51.521
Did you want
to scatter her somewhere?

01:03:54.425 --> 01:03:57.861
Somewhere with water,

01:03:57.862 --> 01:04:01.898
the beach or a river.

01:04:01.899 --> 01:04:05.902
Now I just want to do it,
get it over with.

01:04:05.903 --> 01:04:08.037
Can't keep her locked up
in a pot.

01:04:11.776 --> 01:04:14.477
We just passed a turnoff
for the beach.

01:05:55.713 --> 01:05:56.663
What's up?

01:05:59.116 --> 01:06:01.952
Nothing, just a client.

01:06:07.358 --> 01:06:09.960
Have you got more business
or something?

01:06:12.796 --> 01:06:15.165
No.

01:06:15.166 --> 01:06:17.633
I'm finished.

01:06:36.954 --> 01:06:40.891
So where am I dropping you?

01:06:40.892 --> 01:06:42.825
Home.

01:06:49.533 --> 01:06:50.767
Shit.

01:06:50.768 --> 01:06:53.703
What?

01:07:20.231 --> 01:07:22.365
Sorry, I'm aware
I was speeding.

01:07:22.366 --> 01:07:23.900
Your license.

01:07:30.541 --> 01:07:33.410
Keep your hands
on the steering wheel.

01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:40.016
Who's traveling with you?

01:07:40.017 --> 01:07:41.017
Her name's...

01:07:41.018 --> 01:07:42.652
I'm talking to her. Miss?

01:07:42.653 --> 01:07:45.888
Alice?

01:07:45.889 --> 01:07:48.224
Do you know this man?

01:07:48.225 --> 01:07:49.525
Yeah.

01:07:51.963 --> 01:07:54.030
Can you please step
out of the car, thank you?

01:07:54.031 --> 01:07:55.365
Why?

01:07:55.366 --> 01:07:56.366
What's the problem?

01:07:56.367 --> 01:07:58.835
Get out of the car.

01:07:58.836 --> 01:08:02.205
Slowly.

01:08:02.206 --> 01:08:03.206
Around the front.

01:08:03.207 --> 01:08:06.109
Move round the front of the car.

01:08:06.110 --> 01:08:07.110
Stay there.

01:08:07.111 --> 01:08:08.211
Now get out.

01:08:10.647 --> 01:08:12.282
Close the door.

01:08:12.283 --> 01:08:13.950
Up against the car.

01:08:13.951 --> 01:08:16.419
Turn round against the car.

01:08:18.589 --> 01:08:20.189
Don't look at me;
Look at the car.

01:08:20.191 --> 01:08:22.859
Catch these.

01:08:22.859 --> 01:08:24.493
Handcuff his right wrist.

01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:28.131
Just do what he says.

01:08:30.801 --> 01:08:33.169
All right, now his other one.

01:08:38.442 --> 01:08:41.111
All right, now move out the...
move out the way!

01:08:41.112 --> 01:08:42.112
Stop there.

01:08:42.113 --> 01:08:43.845
Stop there!

01:08:43.846 --> 01:08:49.019
You are under arrest for the
suspected murder of six people.

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:50.020
What?

01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:51.587
Shut your mouth!

01:08:51.587 --> 01:08:53.256
All right.

01:08:53.256 --> 01:08:54.256
To my car; Come on.

01:08:54.258 --> 01:08:55.258
Move it.

01:08:55.259 --> 01:08:56.292
Don't look at me!

01:08:58.295 --> 01:08:59.828
Move. Come on!

01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:08.371
What's going on?

01:09:12.576 --> 01:09:14.676
Tell me.

01:09:17.814 --> 01:09:20.550
Tell me!

01:09:20.551 --> 01:09:24.953
Some men hurt jesse.

01:09:24.955 --> 01:09:27.122
What did you do?

01:10:25.048 --> 01:10:27.250
Where are you taking us?

01:10:31.688 --> 01:10:33.956
What the fuck is this?

01:10:33.957 --> 01:10:34.991
Where are we?

01:10:38.529 --> 01:10:39.529
Don't fucking...

01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:41.831
get out of the car!

01:10:41.832 --> 01:10:43.500
Leave her alone!

01:10:43.501 --> 01:10:47.003
Leave her!

01:10:47.004 --> 01:10:49.139
No, please!

01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:01.651
Let her go!

01:11:22.906 --> 01:11:26.108
G'day.

01:11:26.109 --> 01:11:28.378
You must be mr. Fortesky.

01:11:28.379 --> 01:11:30.980
Have you been looking for me?

01:11:30.981 --> 01:11:32.649
No.

01:11:32.650 --> 01:11:34.417
Really?

01:11:34.418 --> 01:11:36.386
Well, you should be.

01:11:36.387 --> 01:11:42.292
His wallet, keys, knife,
and your mate's mobile phone.

01:11:47.164 --> 01:11:50.066
You should've
gotten rid of this.

01:11:50.067 --> 01:11:52.268
I'm glad you didn't.

01:11:52.269 --> 01:11:54.537
You'd be surprised the contacts
I've got, right?

01:11:54.538 --> 01:11:55.871
Oh, fuck off.

01:11:55.872 --> 01:11:57.440
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:00.777 --> 01:12:03.413
Jeez, youse pigs
are getting expensive.

01:12:03.414 --> 01:12:06.349
You hanging around
this time, hmm?

01:12:08.151 --> 01:12:10.620
What are you gonna do
with the girl?

01:12:10.621 --> 01:12:12.021
What?

01:12:12.022 --> 01:12:14.023
The girl.

01:12:15.259 --> 01:12:16.859
You like her,
you dirty old pig?

01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:17.860
Don't fuckin' touch me.

01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:22.298
Hang on to him.

01:12:22.299 --> 01:12:23.299
What are you doin'?

01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:24.400
I'm takin' my cuffs.

01:12:24.401 --> 01:12:25.635
We're using 'em.

01:12:25.636 --> 01:12:28.738
What, the four of you
can't hang on to him?

01:12:28.739 --> 01:12:30.172
Hold him. Hold him.

01:12:30.173 --> 01:12:31.807
Give me the girl.

01:12:31.808 --> 01:12:33.576
Give me the girl!

01:12:35.912 --> 01:12:37.113
Please, she's got nothing...

01:12:37.114 --> 01:12:38.648
please, she's got
nothing to do with...

01:12:38.649 --> 01:12:40.250
she'll be fine.

01:12:40.251 --> 01:12:42.619
We're lovers, not fighters.

01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:45.455
Come on, I've got plenty of...
I've got money!

01:12:45.456 --> 01:12:48.758
- Really?
- Yes.

01:12:48.759 --> 01:12:50.760
How much is she worth?

01:12:50.761 --> 01:12:54.731
$10,000.

01:12:54.732 --> 01:12:57.066
- Yeah?
- Yes.

01:12:57.067 --> 01:12:58.067
How about $20,000?

01:12:58.068 --> 01:12:59.068
Sure.

01:12:59.069 --> 01:13:00.136
Not bad.

01:13:00.137 --> 01:13:01.971
I think we can squeeze
a little more.

01:13:01.972 --> 01:13:03.373
How about $100,000?

01:13:03.374 --> 01:13:04.707
We can go to the bank tomorrow.

01:13:04.708 --> 01:13:07.543
Anything, $100,000.

01:13:07.544 --> 01:13:09.312
I can arrange it.

01:13:13.183 --> 01:13:17.153
You know, I went to school
with jim and his brother!

01:13:18.422 --> 01:13:21.524
Huh?

01:13:21.525 --> 01:13:25.094
So you know what I'm thinkin'?

01:13:25.095 --> 01:13:28.298
I'm gonna get my money's worth
out of the two of youse tonight.

01:13:28.299 --> 01:13:30.533
Oh, yeah.

01:13:30.534 --> 01:13:34.904
Get the rope and tie him up,
chuck.

01:13:34.905 --> 01:13:36.105
Take him down.

01:13:36.106 --> 01:13:37.106
Little party?

01:13:37.107 --> 01:13:39.942
Yeah, my boy, dig in.

01:13:39.943 --> 01:13:41.544
Give me the arms.

01:13:41.545 --> 01:13:42.878
Fuck off!

01:13:42.879 --> 01:13:43.879
Fuck off!

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.748
Let's go, please.

01:13:45.749 --> 01:13:51.053
Get on him.

01:13:51.054 --> 01:13:51.987
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:13:54.658 --> 01:13:59.529
Get your ass up!

01:13:59.530 --> 01:14:00.530
Hold him, chuck.

01:14:08.339 --> 01:14:09.605
Hold him.

01:14:09.606 --> 01:14:10.940
Hold him!

01:15:17.941 --> 01:15:20.142
You fuckin'...

01:16:15.632 --> 01:16:18.701
Get the fuck up.

01:17:29.372 --> 01:17:33.042
We don't even sleep
in the same room.

01:17:33.043 --> 01:17:36.412
When we watch television,
she watches it in her room.

01:17:36.413 --> 01:17:37.813
I watch it in my room.

01:17:37.814 --> 01:17:41.283
I haven't slept with her
for two years.

01:17:41.284 --> 01:17:44.854
A man should be able to sleep
with his own wife.

01:17:44.855 --> 01:17:45.855
Why does... fuck!

01:17:45.856 --> 01:17:47.823
Leave her the fuck alone!

01:18:01.471 --> 01:18:02.505
You okay?

01:18:03.573 --> 01:18:05.107
It's gonna be all right.

01:18:05.108 --> 01:18:07.910
It's gonna be all right.

01:18:07.911 --> 01:18:09.244
Come here, you fucker!

01:18:45.582 --> 01:18:48.684
Look who's waking up.

01:18:48.685 --> 01:18:50.886
Hey.

01:18:50.887 --> 01:18:53.456
Fuck!

01:18:53.457 --> 01:18:55.090
Charles, just hang on.

01:18:55.091 --> 01:18:56.124
Hang on.

01:19:00.864 --> 01:19:02.164
Do you know
how much of a headache

01:19:02.165 --> 01:19:04.166
that dead pig's gonna be?

01:19:04.167 --> 01:19:05.400
Huh?

01:19:05.401 --> 01:19:08.938
You fuck with one,
and the rest come after you.

01:19:15.712 --> 01:19:17.312
Anyway,

01:19:20.684 --> 01:19:25.888
this little princess and I
have got to get ready.

01:19:25.889 --> 01:19:28.457
Got someone special on their way
over here to meet her.

01:19:44.975 --> 01:19:47.543
Before we go...

01:19:47.544 --> 01:19:48.711
We might have that little chat

01:19:48.712 --> 01:19:51.780
about that slag daughter
of yours.

01:19:51.781 --> 01:19:55.584
You still want to know
what happened, right?

01:19:55.585 --> 01:19:57.820
I know what you did to her.

01:19:57.821 --> 01:20:02.290
But you've been missing out
on all of the good bits.

01:20:02.291 --> 01:20:07.630
See, she got a little up tight
before the shoot.

01:20:07.631 --> 01:20:11.033
Bit of "h" settled her down.

01:20:11.034 --> 01:20:13.235
But she asked for it.

01:20:13.236 --> 01:20:17.472
Honest.

01:20:17.473 --> 01:20:20.142
Didn't give a good look, though.

01:20:20.143 --> 01:20:23.579
Finn wasn't too happy.

01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:25.514
But she didn't complain.

01:20:25.515 --> 01:20:27.282
No.

01:20:27.283 --> 01:20:29.418
In fact...

01:20:29.419 --> 01:20:34.189
She wanted a little topper
before she left.

01:20:34.190 --> 01:20:35.758
And you know what?

01:20:39.896 --> 01:20:42.064
Yeah, we had a little
private time together.

01:20:43.066 --> 01:20:44.066
Oh, yeah.

01:20:44.067 --> 01:20:45.067
You heard me.

01:20:49.138 --> 01:20:53.676
But hey...

01:20:53.677 --> 01:20:54.977
I had to give the hospital
a call

01:20:54.978 --> 01:20:57.880
right after I dumped her off.

01:20:57.881 --> 01:20:59.748
So that's got to be worth
a couple of points there.

01:21:07.490 --> 01:21:09.524
If it makes any difference...

01:21:09.525 --> 01:21:12.561
I did feel pretty rotten
about the whole thing.

01:21:28.411 --> 01:21:29.377
No!

01:21:33.817 --> 01:21:34.883
Now...

01:21:34.884 --> 01:21:37.086
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:21:37.087 --> 01:21:38.821
If you don't mind,

01:21:38.822 --> 01:21:41.123
I'm gonna leave you
with chuck here.

01:21:41.124 --> 01:21:44.026
As much as I'd love to stay
and watch,

01:21:44.027 --> 01:21:46.695
believe it or not,

01:21:46.696 --> 01:21:48.831
I really don't like violence.

01:22:21.164 --> 01:22:23.498
Come on, love.

01:22:25.769 --> 01:22:27.736
Come on.

01:22:27.737 --> 01:22:29.271
See ya.

01:22:42.585 --> 01:22:47.422
Alone at last, eh?

01:22:47.423 --> 01:22:49.158
Mm.

01:23:11.581 --> 01:23:14.649
Okay.

01:23:14.650 --> 01:23:17.753
Now, you might feel
a small pinch, yeah?

01:23:17.754 --> 01:23:19.088
Let me know if it hurts,
all right?

01:23:19.089 --> 01:23:21.623
Okay?

01:23:21.624 --> 01:23:24.392
Wait, wait.

01:23:24.393 --> 01:23:26.795
Stop fucking moving.

01:23:26.796 --> 01:23:28.496
Oh, oh, whoa, whoa.

01:23:49.219 --> 01:23:51.253
Right.

01:23:51.254 --> 01:23:52.888
Now...

01:23:54.057 --> 01:23:56.024
Just let me
seal that up for you.

01:24:34.130 --> 01:24:36.098
Hey.

01:24:36.099 --> 01:24:37.565
Where's derek?

01:24:37.566 --> 01:24:38.566
He's in the shed.

01:24:38.567 --> 01:24:40.468
- Where?
- Over there.

01:24:40.469 --> 01:24:41.469
There.

01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:42.805
Everything set up?

01:24:42.806 --> 01:24:45.040
I don't know, mate.

01:24:45.041 --> 01:24:47.309
It's unlocked.
Just pop your head in.

01:24:48.311 --> 01:24:49.678
The fuck are you doing?

01:24:55.285 --> 01:24:57.585
What are you up to there, eh?

01:25:08.965 --> 01:25:12.100
Yeah.

01:25:12.101 --> 01:25:16.738
All right, then.

01:25:16.739 --> 01:25:18.140
Up we come.

01:25:18.141 --> 01:25:19.975
Up we come.

01:25:19.976 --> 01:25:22.811
Good boy.

01:25:28.417 --> 01:25:31.153
All right.

01:25:31.154 --> 01:25:32.855
Hang on a minute.

01:25:36.392 --> 01:25:37.392
Eenie...

01:25:37.393 --> 01:25:38.793
Meenie...

01:25:38.794 --> 01:25:40.229
Miney...

01:25:40.230 --> 01:25:41.463
Moe.

01:25:43.466 --> 01:25:45.433
Let's make a pirate out of you.

01:25:45.434 --> 01:25:46.434
Ready?

01:25:50.306 --> 01:25:51.240
One minute.

01:25:58.614 --> 01:26:02.717
She wants me to pick up
some cigarettes on the way home.

01:26:02.718 --> 01:26:05.587
Trying to get her to quit.

01:26:07.823 --> 01:26:08.823
Let her have 'em.

01:26:13.296 --> 01:26:16.131
The bitch'll die quicker.

01:26:16.132 --> 01:26:17.332
Is that right?

01:26:17.333 --> 01:26:18.833
Yeah?

01:26:27.076 --> 01:26:30.745
That was a bit rude, buddy.

01:26:30.746 --> 01:26:34.383
Talking about my fuckin' lovely.

01:26:40.423 --> 01:26:42.190
All right.

01:26:42.191 --> 01:26:44.793
Now, you go down again.

01:26:44.794 --> 01:26:47.829
You're fuckin' staying there,
all right?

01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:51.433
I'm not poppin' a discount
for you, okay?

01:26:53.002 --> 01:26:54.736
Where were we?

01:26:54.737 --> 01:26:57.205
I believe it was moe.

01:27:07.951 --> 01:27:08.951
Come here, you fuck!

01:29:37.666 --> 01:29:38.933
Oh, shit.
