00:07.425 --> 00:09.969
Aisha!

00:13.431 --> 00:16.308
Aisha, come on,
just let me know you're okay.

00:27.403 --> 00:29.697
It happened again.

00:29.739 --> 00:31.991
Third time this year.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.410
Less than last year, so progress.

00:34.452 --> 00:37.163
I had the full-on crazy eyes.

00:39.331 --> 00:40.750
Optic nerve spasms.

00:40.791 --> 00:43.127
You get anxious.
Your brain tenses.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.088
What triggered it this time?

00:47.882 --> 00:51.051
Today started pretty good, I guess.

00:54.805 --> 00:57.892
Come on, Frida Kahlo. We're late.

01:05.608 --> 01:07.276
I hung out with Cari.

01:07.318 --> 01:10.196
Peep Caleb Hass' Instagram.
Like, 500 photos...

01:10.237 --> 01:12.198
Till she was literally
loading into her dorm...

01:14.283 --> 01:15.951
News flash, it ain't working.

01:21.332 --> 01:23.209
- What?
- The service bots.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.836
Seeing them like that, um,

01:25.878 --> 01:28.798
just broken into pieces, it makes me sad.

01:32.176 --> 01:36.639
Levi and I conspired about our weekend.

01:40.518 --> 01:42.144
Yeah.

01:42.186 --> 01:44.438
Then it all went to shit.

01:47.942 --> 01:51.362
Who's ready for cymatics?
Jenny, you want to help me?

01:51.403 --> 01:52.738
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay, great.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.866
Come on, come on.
All right, hit this button right here.

01:57.326 --> 01:59.161
Isn't that cool?

01:59.203 --> 02:00.329
That's cymatics.

02:00.371 --> 02:03.332
Patterns created
through vibrational frequencies.

02:03.374 --> 02:05.209
Let's do a different pattern.

02:09.505 --> 02:13.217
All that means is the sound frequency
creates a pattern.

02:15.219 --> 02:18.556
Oh, Aisha!

02:18.597 --> 02:21.058
Can you... can you call a medic, please?

02:21.100 --> 02:23.644
People were staring...

02:23.686 --> 02:25.563
like they could see through me,

02:25.604 --> 02:27.898
like I was a freak,

02:27.940 --> 02:30.860
which, you know, maybe I am.

02:32.736 --> 02:36.073
Does anyone else feel this way?

02:36.115 --> 02:40.035
Aisha, you suffer from a disease
for which there is no cure.

02:40.077 --> 02:42.204
You're human.

02:44.248 --> 02:47.084
Should we end with a meditation?

02:47.126 --> 02:49.378
Okay.

02:49.420 --> 02:51.547
Control your breathing.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.801
Focus only on my voice.

02:57.344 --> 03:01.181
And in... and out.

03:28.167 --> 03:30.377
Hey, bitch. So Caleb...

03:30.419 --> 03:34.423
hmm? is having a party tonight
'cause his parents are in Italy,

03:34.465 --> 03:36.145
and you need to get your ass
over here now.

03:36.175 --> 03:38.510
Ooh, and bring Levi. Okay, bye.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.179
Hey, Picasso.

03:41.764 --> 03:45.184
You'll still love me if I never escape
the middle of nowhere.

03:46.352 --> 03:48.395
Right?

03:48.437 --> 03:49.980
Yeah.

03:50.022 --> 03:52.608
Hey.
- Hey.

03:52.650 --> 03:57.446
I was just gonna hop on over to Cari's
house to study for a chem final, so...

03:57.488 --> 03:58.739
Yeah, okay.

03:58.781 --> 04:01.533
Have you heard anything back
from RISD yet?

04:02.743 --> 04:04.453
- No.
- No?

04:04.495 --> 04:07.539
Well, baby, I really wish
that you would reconsider CalArts.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.541
Listen, they have a great art department.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.418
The dean there thinks
you're really talented,

04:11.460 --> 04:14.588
and it's just a few hours' drive,
you know?

04:14.630 --> 04:18.384
Yeah, well, RISD is Rhode Island,
not Mars.

04:20.219 --> 04:22.221
And, um...

04:22.262 --> 04:23.722
it's also where Mom...

04:23.764 --> 04:25.683
It's where Mom went.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.518
I know.

04:27.559 --> 04:28.559
Yeah.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.691
Okay, well... love you.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.818
Love you, too.

05:01.385 --> 05:03.887
What the fuck are you doing?

05:07.641 --> 05:08.726
Seriously?

05:08.767 --> 05:13.605
Attention required.
Attention required.

05:13.647 --> 05:17.443
Attention.
Attention required.

05:19.111 --> 05:20.863
Initiating report.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.953
Hey, hey, Aisha.
Aisha, wait! Aisha!

05:31.331 --> 05:33.208
Wait, was it, like,
full-on head in shaft,

05:33.250 --> 05:34.251
just, like...?

05:34.293 --> 05:35.586
- Oh, my God.
- Going at it?

05:35.627 --> 05:36.670
Balls?

05:36.712 --> 05:38.172
Was it touching his balls?

05:38.213 --> 05:39.965
Was it cradling them?
- Stop.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.384
Wait, I thought they had coding
that, like, prevented them

05:42.426 --> 05:44.011
from doing the dirty-dirty.

05:44.053 --> 05:46.889
I mean, yeah, they do, but is that
your biggest concern right now?

05:46.930 --> 05:48.265
I mean, it's pervy fucked up.

05:48.307 --> 05:50.976
Yeah, and a bit disrespectful.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.312
Okay, but would you feel the same way
if you caught him

05:53.353 --> 05:55.522
jacking it off
with one of those Fleshlight thingies?

05:55.564 --> 05:57.524
- A Flesh...
- The flashlight.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.860
It looks like a flashlight,
but it has a pussy inside,

05:59.902 --> 06:01.653
and he just, like...

06:01.695 --> 06:03.447
I definitely need a drink.

06:03.489 --> 06:04.990
Whoo!

06:26.804 --> 06:29.139
Caleb.

06:43.821 --> 06:45.030
This is okay?

06:45.072 --> 06:46.406
I mean, you and Levi.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.242
- Forget Levi. He screwed up.
- Okay.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.743
Home System, dim the lights.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.346
Dimming Caleb bedroom lights.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.371
Seventy percent.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.914
Home System, music.

06:53.956 --> 06:54.998
Damp Snack.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.559
Playing Damp Snack.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.918
Home System, lower the, uh...

06:57.960 --> 06:59.640
Stop playing
with the stupid Home System.

06:59.670 --> 07:00.879
Okay.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.756
Jeez, what the fuck are you doing?

07:02.798 --> 07:03.983
I'm sorry, sorry! I'm sorry!

07:04.007 --> 07:05.276
Hey, you weren't even
supposed to be here.

07:05.300 --> 07:06.319
I'm gonna fuck you up, Greg!

07:06.343 --> 07:07.904
Just bringing other people in,
that's all.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.012
Really?

07:09.054 --> 07:10.931
Caleb Hass?

07:10.973 --> 07:13.809
You've got no right to talk.

07:15.018 --> 07:18.313
Look, Tio told me
about these cheat codes, okay?

07:18.355 --> 07:20.708
He said that you can use them
to get around the emBed's limits

07:20.732 --> 07:22.276
and get them to do stuff.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.420
I honestly didn't even think
it was gonna work, and then when it did,

07:24.444 --> 07:27.781
I just wanted to see if it was,
I don't know, fucking different.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.659
Aw.

07:30.701 --> 07:32.119
Well, was it?

07:33.537 --> 07:34.830
Hmm?

07:36.206 --> 07:38.041
Tell me all about it.

07:39.710 --> 07:42.212
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
But it was a shitty bot.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.506
It was a thing.
It doesn't mean anything.

07:44.548 --> 07:47.843
Well, it means something to me,
and it matters

07:47.885 --> 07:50.721
because you're supposed to be
my boyfriend,

07:50.762 --> 07:52.723
and now you're not.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.782
Oh, shit.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.836
Oh, fuck.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.627
What did I do?

10:27.669 --> 10:29.129
Are you up, kiddo?

10:29.171 --> 10:30.589
Look, I've got exams,

10:30.630 --> 10:32.317
so I'm not gonna be back
until around 9:00, okay?

10:32.341 --> 10:34.843
Lunch is on the table.

10:34.885 --> 10:36.428
No, Dad, wait.

10:36.470 --> 10:37.929
Please.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.473
Oh, please.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.697
Dude, what the hell?

10:55.739 --> 10:56.740
Where did you go?

10:56.782 --> 10:58.408
I've been texting you all night.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.827
I-I was...

11:00.869 --> 11:02.662
I was fucked up.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.790
Really?

11:04.831 --> 11:08.794
That bathroom looked like a bloodbath,
like you murdered someone.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.004
You didn't kill anyone, did you?

11:11.046 --> 11:12.047
Mm-mm.

11:12.089 --> 11:13.340
I, um...

11:13.382 --> 11:16.218
I was having another one of my eye things.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.053
Okay. Yeah.

11:23.058 --> 11:25.644
Was last night about Levi?

11:25.685 --> 11:28.438
Wait, were you in there
trying to hurt yourself?

11:28.480 --> 11:30.273
Aisha, were you cutting?

11:30.315 --> 11:32.567
Look, I was... I was drunk.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.611
Fell.

11:34.653 --> 11:37.280
So I got embarrassed and left.

11:39.241 --> 11:41.118
Aisha, just talk to me.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.537
I'll find you later, okay?

12:19.114 --> 12:21.283
Okay. 108.

12:24.202 --> 12:25.912
Aisha?

12:25.954 --> 12:27.122
What are you doing?

12:29.583 --> 12:30.768
Wait, what the fuck is that?

12:30.792 --> 12:32.145
- Get off of me!
- What the fuck is that?

12:32.169 --> 12:34.254
God!

12:34.296 --> 12:36.465
Don't touch me, Jenny.

12:44.139 --> 12:45.859
You've reached out to Sharon Carter.

12:45.891 --> 12:47.642
Leave a message.

12:47.684 --> 12:50.061
Hi, Sharon, it's... it's me.

12:50.103 --> 12:53.106
I need an emergency session, um, now.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.233
I-I need to talk about, um,

12:55.275 --> 12:59.404
just about some... some, uh...

12:59.446 --> 13:02.449
j-just, can you call me back later,
please?

13:02.491 --> 13:04.326
Thanks. William!

13:04.367 --> 13:05.494
Hey.

13:06.828 --> 13:09.498
Uh, can we talk?

13:09.539 --> 13:12.167
Of course.
I'm always available.

13:12.209 --> 13:13.960
Right, okay, uh...

13:14.002 --> 13:15.754
just, just...

13:22.844 --> 13:24.638
We've reached my geographic limitation.

13:24.679 --> 13:27.432
Also, there's two seconds
until the first period bell.

13:29.351 --> 13:30.936
If you're in privacy mode,

13:30.977 --> 13:34.731
anything we talk about
is just between us?

13:34.773 --> 13:36.691
I need you to verbally accept.

13:39.402 --> 13:40.654
accept.

13:44.866 --> 13:46.243
How can I be of service?

13:48.245 --> 13:53.542
Um, do you know what this is?

13:53.583 --> 13:55.710
It's your haptic tensor system

13:55.752 --> 13:57.295
for multilinear subspace learning.

14:02.008 --> 14:05.095
Do you have this in you?

14:05.136 --> 14:07.222
I cannot provide that information.

14:07.264 --> 14:09.140
Yeah, no, I-I just want to know

14:09.182 --> 14:13.937
if it's similar technology

14:13.979 --> 14:16.481
that's inside of you.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.401
I'm sorry, if you continue
this particular line of questioning,

14:19.442 --> 14:20.962
I'll be forced to return to public mode

14:20.986 --> 14:23.363
and issue a report to administrators
and my manufacture...

14:23.405 --> 14:25.824
Okay, fine, I'll stop!

14:30.120 --> 14:31.955
You were hurting yourself?

14:31.997 --> 14:34.082
I was trashed.

14:34.124 --> 14:37.335
And I thought I saw something, so...

14:37.377 --> 14:39.087
I had to find out.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.050
Look, um...

14:50.599 --> 14:51.975
It's everywhere.

14:52.017 --> 14:54.936
Um, I mean...

14:54.978 --> 14:56.146
Okay.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.522
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.692
I'm... I'm a machine!

15:00.734 --> 15:02.986
It's okay, sweetheart.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.904
Does my dad know?

15:04.946 --> 15:06.072
He must know, right?

15:06.114 --> 15:07.991
It means I wasn't born, I...

15:08.033 --> 15:10.493
I was made, and...

15:10.535 --> 15:12.621
and that I'm not real, and...

15:12.662 --> 15:13.955
and that...

15:13.997 --> 15:15.165
No, it's okay.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.542
What's... what's happen...
What's happening to me?

15:17.584 --> 15:19.628
Breathe, breathe.
No, no, no, no, no.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.212
No, breathe, breathe, breathe.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.607
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe.

15:22.631 --> 15:24.257
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

15:24.299 --> 15:25.842
Breathe, feel my body against yours.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.177
You're okay!

15:27.218 --> 15:28.511
- Okay.
- Breathe.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.513
Take a deep breath.
Take a deep breath.

15:30.555 --> 15:34.601
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

15:34.643 --> 15:37.228
It's okay.
It's okay.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.897
You're okay, I got you.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.608
Close your eyes, okay?

15:41.650 --> 15:44.152
And in...

15:44.194 --> 15:46.738
- Oh, God.
- And out.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.199
And in...

15:49.240 --> 15:51.785
and out.

15:51.826 --> 15:54.454
And in.

15:54.496 --> 15:57.207
And out.

15:57.248 --> 15:59.959
In.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.670
Out.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.063
Admin mode.

16:20.105 --> 16:24.484
Code DI5VU2108.

16:24.526 --> 16:26.986
Prompt command options.
Stasis mode.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.119
Admin prompt.
Network mode.

16:54.139 --> 16:56.015
Admin prompt.

16:56.057 --> 16:57.475
Archive and erase.

17:30.258 --> 17:31.384
- Yeah?
- Hey, there.

17:31.426 --> 17:34.804
Yeah, uh, she, um... she, uh...

17:34.846 --> 17:37.390
she figured it out again.

17:41.936 --> 17:44.105
Hey, Picasso.

18:19.474 --> 18:20.600
Hey.

18:20.642 --> 18:21.643
Hey, buddy.

18:21.684 --> 18:22.685
Here.

18:24.187 --> 18:26.189
Come here, you.

18:45.708 --> 18:46.876
Good morning.

18:48.211 --> 18:49.170
Huh.

18:49.212 --> 18:50.380
You made breakfast?

18:50.421 --> 18:52.757
Oatmeal.
Comfort food.

18:52.799 --> 18:53.967
Comfort food?

18:54.008 --> 18:55.426
- Mm.
- Why?

18:55.468 --> 19:00.765
Well, if you must know...

19:00.807 --> 19:03.601
I've got terrible cramps,

19:03.643 --> 19:06.271
which means I'm about to go
full menses.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.939
- Mm.
- And second,

19:07.981 --> 19:12.986
have you ever have one of those dreams

19:13.027 --> 19:18.199
that feels totally real,
even though it's super crazy,

19:18.241 --> 19:21.035
and once you wake up, it's a total relief?

19:21.077 --> 19:23.997
Yeah, I guess so.

19:24.038 --> 19:28.418
Mm.

19:28.459 --> 19:31.421
I killed Picasso.

19:31.462 --> 19:35.425
Well, Robot Picasso.

19:35.466 --> 19:39.554
It wasn't pretty.

19:39.596 --> 19:41.806
But you're okay now?

19:41.848 --> 19:43.349
Basically.

19:48.271 --> 19:51.441
I'll clean all of this later.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.234
You won't.

19:53.276 --> 19:54.652
Yeah, but you love me anyway.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.821
- Yeah, I do.
- And, oh, hey.

19:56.863 --> 20:00.825
I was thinking about spending the night
at Cari's on Saturday

20:00.867 --> 20:04.454
and hanging out with her
a bit on Sunday.

20:04.495 --> 20:06.664
Um, yeah, I guess that's... that's okay,

20:06.706 --> 20:09.250
but save a little Sunday for Dad.

20:09.292 --> 20:11.377
Only if we order Chinese.

20:11.419 --> 20:12.837
- Okay.
- See you tonight.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.464
Yes.

20:14.505 --> 20:19.844
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.054
Oh.

20:21.095 --> 20:22.180
Hey, C!

20:22.221 --> 20:25.850
Cari!

20:25.892 --> 20:27.143
I'll catch up with you guys.

20:27.185 --> 20:30.063
Hey, guys.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.690
OK, so.
Um...

20:32.732 --> 20:35.818
I'll be staying at your place on Saturday.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.487
I mean, I'll actually be at Levi's,

20:37.528 --> 20:39.864
but my Dad thinks that I'll be at yours,

20:39.906 --> 20:41.491
and he has your cell, so just...

20:41.532 --> 20:42.492
just cover for me.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.369
What the hell, Aisha?

20:44.410 --> 20:45.870
What?
I've done it for you before...

20:45.912 --> 20:47.538
I'm talking about the party;

20:47.580 --> 20:51.250
yesterday too, when you just
shut me out, blew me off.

20:51.292 --> 20:54.003
Look, I don't know
what's going on with you,

20:54.045 --> 20:55.713
and I don't know if it's this Levi thing

20:55.755 --> 20:57.882
or maybe it's the Caleb thing...

20:57.924 --> 21:00.969
- What are you...
- Which... yeah, I found out about that.

21:01.010 --> 21:04.222
You knew I liked him, so don't come
up to me asking for favors

21:04.263 --> 21:05.515
like everything's normal.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.520
Wait.

21:10.561 --> 21:14.273
Wait, what... what happened with Caleb?

21:16.776 --> 21:18.569
What party?

21:33.584 --> 21:34.836
Shit.

21:42.385 --> 21:44.470
What the fuck?

21:52.186 --> 21:53.563
Hey, Jenny.

21:53.604 --> 21:56.566
You're here early.

21:56.607 --> 22:02.363
Have you always known?

22:02.405 --> 22:04.782
Known what?

22:04.824 --> 22:06.951
That you're, um...

22:06.993 --> 22:08.119
You know.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.621
Oh.
Okay.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.376
I won't tell anyone.

22:15.418 --> 22:22.300
Okay.

22:22.341 --> 22:25.261
It's gone?

22:25.303 --> 22:26.179
Yesterday...

22:26.220 --> 22:27.531
You know, I've read they're working on

22:27.555 --> 22:29.390
a self-generating flesh replacement.

22:29.432 --> 22:30.975
I mean, how does it work,

22:31.017 --> 22:32.560
like a... like an internal 3D printer

22:32.602 --> 22:33.603
Or something or what...

22:33.644 --> 22:38.399
Whatever you're doing, stop.

22:38.441 --> 22:39.984
I'm not doing anything.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.320
Yeah, you, Cari.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.989
Why is everyone fucking with me today?

22:51.245 --> 22:53.831
Sorry about this.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.833
I really am.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.424
Stop it.

23:22.193 --> 23:23.903
Stop!

23:23.945 --> 23:24.946
Please!

23:29.492 --> 23:34.038
There isn't a human alive that can
register a pitch that high, Aisha.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.749
And not even animals.

23:36.791 --> 23:40.044
Only a machine...

23:42.296 --> 23:44.257
You're one of them, Aisha.

23:44.298 --> 23:46.092
Okay.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.099
Crap.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.480
Have a great day.

23:59.522 --> 24:00.690
Out of the way.

24:00.731 --> 24:01.566
Sure.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.210
Although we only have two minutes
and nine seconds

24:03.234 --> 24:05.278
until second bell.

24:05.319 --> 24:07.530
And I must say, you have the same agitated
look

24:07.572 --> 24:09.907
as when we talked yesterday.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.409
We talked?

24:11.450 --> 24:13.202
At 09:47,

24:13.244 --> 24:15.246
for 11 minutes.

24:15.288 --> 24:18.291
What did we talk about?

24:18.332 --> 24:20.084
You put me in privacy mode.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.711
In order to access that conversation,

24:21.752 --> 24:23.588
you need to authorize and accept.

24:27.508 --> 24:28.509
Come with me.

24:34.348 --> 24:36.434
Okay, I authorize and accept.

24:40.771 --> 24:43.232
Permission to touch you.

24:43.274 --> 24:45.109
Uh...

24:45.151 --> 24:46.360
Okay.

24:51.574 --> 24:53.993
Your drive was wiped 18 hours ago.

24:56.579 --> 24:57.747
My what?

24:57.788 --> 24:59.540
Memory drive.

24:59.582 --> 25:02.335
Unless it's been overwritten,
I can restore that for you.

25:02.376 --> 25:03.586
Would you like me to restore?

25:03.628 --> 25:04.462
Yes.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.338
You have to say...

25:05.379 --> 25:08.674
- I accept.
- "I accept."

25:09.800 --> 25:12.470
Restoring memory data.

25:55.221 --> 26:00.184
Fuck.

26:06.440 --> 26:09.193
Fuck!

26:23.124 --> 26:24.333
Ladies and gentlemen.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.770
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
if I could have your attention,

26:26.794 --> 26:30.339
gather round, please.

26:30.381 --> 26:32.550
I want to thank you all
for coming out tonight

26:32.591 --> 26:36.053
for the unveiling of
William's newest product

26:36.846 --> 26:38.597
in human enhancement.

26:38.639 --> 26:43.394
This drop contains millions
of synthetic nanobots.

26:43.436 --> 26:46.939
And what they're gonna do this evening
is permeate Kathleen's eardrum,

26:46.981 --> 26:51.652
repair it, and then fuse permanently
to her sterocilia.

26:51.694 --> 26:53.696
Now, Kathleen,

26:53.738 --> 26:55.531
there's gonna be no pain.

26:55.573 --> 26:58.409
It will just be a little cold at first.

26:58.451 --> 27:00.995
Are you ready?

27:01.037 --> 27:03.372
Awesome.

27:03.414 --> 27:06.834
This is gonna change your life.

27:15.384 --> 27:17.845
Good?

27:17.887 --> 27:21.849
Kathleen was born with Anacusis,
total deafness.

27:21.891 --> 27:24.352
And tonight we're gonna help her hear
for the first time.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.645
- Great presentation.
- Thank you.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.522
I don't like your look.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.166
Does Merced, California,
mean anything to you?

28:11.190 --> 28:12.483
Not particularly.

28:12.525 --> 28:14.944
Well, I think we've got
a serious problem there.

28:23.327 --> 28:26.080
How'd you do it?

28:28.874 --> 28:33.003
EmBeds, they, um, they
have intimacy restrictions.

28:33.045 --> 28:35.589
How'd you get around them?

28:35.631 --> 28:37.633
I told you, some online forum.

28:37.675 --> 28:39.111
There were these chicos, and then I...
I just...

28:39.135 --> 28:40.428
Give them to me.

28:40.469 --> 28:42.072
Baby, come on.
Can we just talk about this?

28:42.096 --> 28:44.348
No, the codes.

28:44.390 --> 28:48.727
How do I get them?

28:53.983 --> 28:56.360
I... I wouldn't do that if I were you.

28:56.402 --> 28:59.363
I didn't want to use my own laptop
in case I got tracked.

28:59.405 --> 29:03.033
Okay, well,
it seems like you went through

29:03.742 --> 29:07.121
a lot of trouble,
and you know what?

29:07.163 --> 29:11.542
Hope it was worth it.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.163
I swear to you, Bobby,

30:32.998 --> 30:34.798
if he so much as glances
my way one more time,

30:36.168 --> 30:39.797
I will carve his heart out
with a dull wooden spoon.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.967
Initiate audio record and playback?

30:43.008 --> 30:45.594
- Yes.
- Initiating playback.

30:45.636 --> 30:48.305
Your weird-ass little brother
walked in on me showering.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.474
- Shit, Shit.
- I swear to you, Bobby,

30:50.516 --> 30:52.518
if he so much as glances
my way one more time...

30:52.560 --> 30:54.603
Deactivate playback.

30:54.645 --> 30:56.480
Everything all right?

30:56.522 --> 30:58.107
Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.

30:58.148 --> 31:02.820
Well, could you please keep your voice
or phone or whatever that noise is down?

31:02.861 --> 31:05.239
Totally.

31:05.281 --> 31:07.449
Are... are you okay?

31:07.491 --> 31:11.662
Yeah, it's just...
where's the bathroom?

31:11.704 --> 31:13.122
Oh, it's... it's right...

31:13.163 --> 31:14.498
Thank you.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.417
Stupid cramps.

31:36.645 --> 31:39.189
Oh, my God. Okay.

31:39.231 --> 31:42.484
Okay...

31:42.526 --> 31:44.528

Well, look who can turn off her period.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.511
We've got to contain this before it
gets to the goddamn shareholders.

32:33.535 --> 32:36.372
When did this happen?
- This happened two days ago.

32:36.413 --> 32:38.373
A unit in Merced had its
intimacy limits removed..

32:38.749 --> 32:41.251
Roblow.
Robot blow j... anyways,

32:41.293 --> 32:44.254
do you want me to communicate
with the local installer?

32:44.296 --> 32:47.007
No.
No, I'll send my brother.

32:47.049 --> 32:48.926
Abel?

32:48.967 --> 32:52.221
You're... you're gonna send...

Sending me on the Jet.

34:18.557 --> 34:20.309

My brother can't have the precious
moneymakers malfunctioning.

34:24.980 --> 34:27.316
Merced Magnet School, clean it up.

34:29.777 --> 34:31.528
Took me to a Vietnamese restaurant once.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.739
Fantastic pho, terrific.

34:33.781 --> 34:37.159
He's not gonna have time for pho.

34:37.201 --> 34:39.328
No?

34:39.369 --> 34:41.205
Probably no pho.

34:44.374 --> 34:46.293
Okay.

34:46.335 --> 34:50.088
Half power to stun, full power to fry.

34:50.130 --> 34:52.800
You've outdone yourself.

34:54.384 --> 34:57.346
Keep it away from kids and animals.

34:57.387 --> 34:58.847
I'll do my best.

35:09.983 --> 35:11.735
Aisha?

35:11.777 --> 35:12.986
Hey.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.532
What happened, honey?
What happened?

35:16.573 --> 35:18.367
I-I got a little lightheaded.

35:18.408 --> 35:21.161
She passed out.
I saw it happen from across the street.

35:21.203 --> 35:23.181
Oh, did... did you hit your head
or anything, babe?

35:23.205 --> 35:24.623
No. I'm fine.

35:24.665 --> 35:26.184
- You're fine. Okay, here, okay.
- Oh, no.

35:26.208 --> 35:28.186
I think you should call an ambulance.
- She's fine, all right?

35:28.210 --> 35:29.850
Please.
- Who are you? Are you her father?

35:29.878 --> 35:31.964
Who are you? Back off, okay?

35:32.005 --> 35:34.550
- Just... we got it, all right?
- Oh, my God.

35:34.591 --> 35:35.968
- Is this yours?
- I got it.

35:36.009 --> 35:36.969
- Okay.
- Wow.

35:37.010 --> 35:38.780
Here, let me... let me take this
for you, okay?

35:38.804 --> 35:40.198
W-we're fine. We'll take it from here.

35:40.222 --> 35:42.182
Come on, babe. Come on.

35:42.224 --> 35:43.767
Um...

35:43.809 --> 35:46.311
maybe I should go to the hospital.

35:46.353 --> 35:48.206
I don't... I don't know
if that's necessary, baby.

35:48.230 --> 35:49.523
What if I have a concussion?

35:49.565 --> 35:51.400
You said you didn't hit
your head, right?

35:51.441 --> 35:52.776
- Right.
- Okay.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.420
Well, then let's just get you home, okay?

35:54.444 --> 35:57.197
I think you probably just have
low blood sugar or something.

35:57.239 --> 36:00.617
And we'll get some food and water in you.
I'll order from Yang's, okay?

36:02.452 --> 36:04.788
You know I don't like Chinese.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.583
No... yeah.
No, La... La Cabaña, La Cabaña, Mexican.

36:07.624 --> 36:09.018
Okay, just sit back.
Put your seat belt on.

36:09.042 --> 36:10.878
You're gonna be all right.

36:15.465 --> 36:16.800
Okay.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.594
Let's go.

36:18.635 --> 36:20.053
You're gonna be fine.

36:22.264 --> 36:24.433
This is an example of surface tension.

36:24.474 --> 36:27.019
If you look closely,
when the pink is behind the green,

36:27.060 --> 36:28.645
it makes a brown color.

36:28.687 --> 36:30.606
Water and oil don't mix.

36:54.046 --> 36:55.714
No Aisha?

36:55.756 --> 36:58.216
Uh, I haven't seen her today.

36:58.258 --> 37:00.510
I'll call the office.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.272
Okay, well, you're looking better,

37:12.314 --> 37:14.650
so, look, why don't you go on in
and, um, order the food?

37:14.691 --> 37:17.527
And I-I've got to... I've got to get
back to this faculty meeting.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.030
Uh, and I'll see you later, okay?

37:20.072 --> 37:21.114
Okay.

37:36.088 --> 37:37.089
Yeah, it's me.

37:37.130 --> 37:39.675
Listen, she, uh... she...
she collapsed again.

37:42.928 --> 37:45.514
Initiate audio enhancement.

37:45.555 --> 37:48.558
Yeah, this time she asked me
to take her to the hospital.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.894
Of course I didn't take her
to the goddamn h...

37:50.936 --> 37:53.105
Look... no, it's all these lies, okay?

37:53.146 --> 37:55.708
They're all, like, building up
and collapsing on top of each other.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.317
Are you listening to me?

37:57.359 --> 37:59.111
Listen, I-I'm coming over.

39:06.636 --> 39:09.181
- Want some coffee?
- No.

39:09.222 --> 39:13.769
Look, y-you could've at least told me that
you made her stop liking Chinese food.

39:13.810 --> 39:14.978
I didn't.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.772
Maybe she was testing you.

39:16.813 --> 39:19.608
She's hacking her own system.

39:19.649 --> 39:22.778
- Well, that's new.
- Yeah, but not unexpected.

39:22.819 --> 39:25.322
It was only a matter of time
before she adapted.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.782
I'll wipe, archive, and reinstall.

39:26.823 --> 39:27.783
Jesus.

39:27.824 --> 39:29.451
Hey, you know, I...

39:29.493 --> 39:31.620
I-I-I have to keep a damn journal,

39:31.661 --> 39:35.624
you know, just to... just to keep track
of what reality we're living in, Sharon.

39:35.665 --> 39:38.794
Sharon, Sharon, listen...

39:38.835 --> 39:40.629
We can't keep doing this.
It's not right.

39:40.670 --> 39:43.006
We've taken so much of her life from her.

39:43.048 --> 39:45.300
Okay, there is no choice.

39:45.342 --> 39:48.220
If she becomes aware...

39:48.261 --> 39:50.430
it's only a matter of time
before they become aware.

39:50.472 --> 39:54.184
And if they become aware,
they know she's here and not in a box...

39:54.226 --> 39:56.269
They'll come for her, I-I know.

40:12.869 --> 40:15.664
Let's just tell her,
I mean, bring her in on it with us.

40:15.705 --> 40:18.041
If she's in on it,
what does she become then exactly?

40:21.711 --> 40:23.380
The whole point of the experiment is...

40:23.421 --> 40:26.758
She is not an experiment, Sharon, okay?
Not to me.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.601
You knew what this work was, Martin.

40:36.643 --> 40:38.061
And you agreed.

40:38.103 --> 40:40.480
Well, okay, well,
then I-I don't agree anymore.

40:40.522 --> 40:41.982
I disagree. I un-agree.

40:42.023 --> 40:44.109
Whatever.
I don't... I don't want to do it anymore.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.561
You have to understand, at some point,

41:01.585 --> 41:03.879
I'm gonna do what is right
for my daughter.

41:03.920 --> 41:04.921
That's...

41:24.232 --> 41:26.318
Welcome, Martin Taylor.

41:26.359 --> 41:28.528
Activating surveillance system.

41:31.239 --> 41:33.116
Wait a minute. What...

41:33.158 --> 41:35.327
What is this? What's going on?

41:35.368 --> 41:37.346
It's always been the best way
to get you to shut up.

41:37.370 --> 41:39.623
Jesus. Fuck you, Sharon.

41:41.166 --> 41:43.543
Which is what usually followed.

41:58.642 --> 42:01.394
What the fuck?

42:26.461 --> 42:28.004
Huh.

42:28.046 --> 42:30.006
You're not a TA.

42:30.048 --> 42:32.259
I'm guessing you're not faculty either.

42:32.300 --> 42:33.343
I'm a kid.

42:33.385 --> 42:34.344
Yes.

42:34.386 --> 42:36.638
I... I can see that part.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.598
Sharon Carter is my mom.

42:38.640 --> 42:43.561
She's a visiting fellow from the
neurophysics research group at SMU.

42:43.603 --> 42:46.231
Oh.
Oh, that's impressive.

42:46.273 --> 42:50.443
If you say so.

42:50.485 --> 42:52.237
She teach you to play Go?

42:52.279 --> 42:53.571
I taught myself.

42:53.613 --> 42:59.828
Wow.
Well, now that... that is very impressive.

42:59.869 --> 43:02.831
And you're playing both sides?

43:02.872 --> 43:07.669
Uh, do you mind if I play?
Can I...

43:07.711 --> 43:11.047
Okay, great.

43:11.089 --> 43:13.758
I have to warn you.
I did play a little bit in college.

43:13.800 --> 43:16.511
So I am... I am pretty good.

43:29.107 --> 43:31.192
Yeah, well, uh...

43:32.235 --> 43:33.987
It would pretty much be over.

43:34.029 --> 43:35.196
Yeah.

43:36.239 --> 43:38.325
Guess so.

43:38.366 --> 43:41.494
You know, you should've
practiced more in college.

43:41.536 --> 43:45.498
How about we start fresh
and I play for myself?

43:45.540 --> 43:46.726
If it'll make you feel better.

43:46.750 --> 43:47.751
Hey, can we...

43:47.792 --> 43:48.835
Hi, Mom.

43:48.877 --> 43:50.712
Oh, hi.

43:50.754 --> 43:52.297
I... I'm Martin Taylor...

43:52.339 --> 43:53.340
- Hi.
- Hi.

43:53.757 --> 43:55.151
She's always been very precocious.

43:55.175 --> 43:56.217
She's...

43:56.259 --> 43:58.219
Better with adults
than with kids her age.

43:58.261 --> 43:59.304
You noticed that, right?

43:59.346 --> 44:00.722
Yeah, yeah.

44:00.764 --> 44:02.515
Did you homeschool her?

44:02.557 --> 44:05.602
Since we moved to Dallas, yeah.

44:05.643 --> 44:08.438
And her father?
Is he, uh, in the...

44:08.480 --> 44:11.524
- No.
- Oh.

44:11.566 --> 44:13.318
Well, you know, maybe

44:13.360 --> 44:17.155
maybe she should go to a regular school.

44:17.197 --> 44:19.741
You know, just be around kids,

44:19.783 --> 44:22.994
classrooms and hallways, mean girls.

44:23.912 --> 44:25.973
Well, she's been through a lot
when she was younger,

44:25.997 --> 44:27.332
so...
- Oh.

44:27.374 --> 44:30.752
I'm just taking it
one step at a time.

44:30.794 --> 44:31.753
Oh, yeah.

44:31.795 --> 44:36.508
No, that makes sense.

44:36.549 --> 44:40.220
Well, I hope you're
having a good time here anyway.

44:41.596 --> 44:43.348
Does it seem like I'm not?

44:43.390 --> 44:44.557
No, no, no, no.
No.

44:44.599 --> 44:46.976
It's just, um...

44:47.018 --> 44:50.188
when... when you said "let's meet,"
I... maybe I got the wrong idea.

44:50.230 --> 44:52.190
I mean, we've...

44:52.232 --> 44:54.484
it's just we've been here,
you know, over an hour

44:54.526 --> 44:56.986
and all we've really talked about
is Aisha,

44:57.028 --> 45:00.365
you know, my impressions of her and her,

45:00.407 --> 45:03.368
you know, interactions
and all that kind of stuff.

45:03.410 --> 45:05.578
And when I ask about you...

45:05.620 --> 45:07.205
you deflect a little bit.

45:07.247 --> 45:11.793
You know, you evade.

45:11.835 --> 45:13.795
Sorry.
I...

45:13.837 --> 45:15.380
Yeah, I'm...

45:15.422 --> 45:17.465
- No, it's...
- I'm... I'm kind of private.

45:17.507 --> 45:20.343
And, Aisha's...

45:20.385 --> 45:23.388
Well, she's kind of my life's work, so...

45:23.430 --> 45:25.265
Yeah, I get that.

45:28.435 --> 45:31.479
But I do like talking to
you, Martin.

45:31.521 --> 45:34.607
Oh.

45:34.649 --> 45:38.027
Good, good.

45:38.069 --> 45:39.612
How do you feel about my apartment?

45:41.281 --> 45:43.241
Ooh!

45:44.284 --> 45:45.243
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

45:45.285 --> 45:46.119
What?

45:46.161 --> 45:47.620
- What about Aisha?
- What?

45:47.662 --> 45:48.764
- Are we gonna wake her up?
- Aisha?

45:48.788 --> 45:49.831
Yeah.

45:49.873 --> 45:51.833
Oh, World War III wouldn't wake her.

45:51.875 --> 45:54.043
Come with me, young man.

46:06.306 --> 46:08.475
I left something out...

46:08.516 --> 46:11.436
about...

46:11.478 --> 46:13.480
what I noticed about Aisha.

46:17.108 --> 46:19.861
Cynth.

46:19.903 --> 46:22.071
Cynthia...

46:22.113 --> 46:24.073
my daughter.

46:24.115 --> 46:27.535
My daughter, she's eight years old,
and she, uh...

46:27.577 --> 46:31.080
she started...

46:31.122 --> 46:32.540
throwing up.

46:32.582 --> 46:35.293
We were at a picnic,

46:35.335 --> 46:38.463
and half her class
was taken down by the flu,

46:38.505 --> 46:43.343
but in her case, it wasn't the flu.

46:43.384 --> 46:47.096
It was salmonella.

46:47.138 --> 46:52.101
No idea where she got it,
but it has a neurotoxin.

46:52.143 --> 46:54.020
It went to her brain.

46:55.939 --> 46:58.900
She was gone.

46:58.942 --> 47:01.486
Uh...

47:03.530 --> 47:06.324
I'm not with her mother anymore.

47:06.366 --> 47:07.909
You know, obviously.

47:07.951 --> 47:10.495
She divorced me a few months later.

47:10.537 --> 47:15.124
But, uh, Cynthia would have been 13,

47:15.166 --> 47:18.753
a couple years younger than Aisha is.

47:19.963 --> 47:22.924
And I just thought I...

47:22.966 --> 47:25.635
saw something familiar in her.

47:25.677 --> 47:28.930
Her spirit or something.

47:28.972 --> 47:30.974
That's what I left out.

47:43.695 --> 47:45.363
World War II.
- Yeah.

47:45.405 --> 47:47.740
- Okay.
- What about it?

47:47.782 --> 47:50.368
- Ah.
- Merry Christmas.

47:51.286 --> 47:52.912
Ho, ho, ho time.

48:01.212 --> 48:03.047
Voice unlock.
Play warning, please.

48:03.089 --> 48:07.969
Aisha Unit,
low battery detected.

48:08.011 --> 48:09.887
Aisha?

48:09.929 --> 48:13.182
Is this person famous?

48:13.224 --> 48:15.184
Uh, more infamous.

48:15.226 --> 48:16.853
No extra help, Martin.

48:16.894 --> 48:18.396
Just yes or no answers.

48:18.438 --> 48:19.707
I know.
I'm just, you know, trying to be...

48:19.731 --> 48:20.565
Specific.

48:20.607 --> 48:21.482
- Yeah.
- Yes. I know.

48:21.524 --> 48:23.484
You're very specific, Martin.

48:23.526 --> 48:25.778
Aisha?

48:25.820 --> 48:26.654
Aisha?

48:26.696 --> 48:27.798
Danger of malfunction.

48:27.822 --> 48:29.782
Aisha Unit, low battery detected.

48:29.824 --> 48:31.159
Admin mode.

48:31.200 --> 48:35.079
Access code DI5VU2108.

48:35.121 --> 48:35.955
Fuck.

48:35.997 --> 48:37.915
This is

48:37.957 --> 48:39.542
a dead American man...

48:39.584 --> 48:40.418
- Yep.
- Infamous...

48:40.460 --> 48:42.587
Accelerating to keep up with traffic flow.

48:42.629 --> 48:43.671
Is that okay, Martin?

48:43.713 --> 48:46.591
Yes, thank you, car.
Stop trying to be my friend.

48:47.508 --> 48:48.551
I'm your friend.

48:50.762 --> 48:51.947
You have a call from Sharon.

48:51.971 --> 48:52.805
Hello?

48:52.847 --> 48:53.806
Where are you?

48:53.848 --> 48:55.224
Hey, yeah, um...

48:55.266 --> 48:57.026
Aisha called me,
so I went and picked her up.

48:57.060 --> 48:58.245
We're gonna go get some coffee.

48:58.269 --> 48:59.371
She was feeling kind of groggy, so...

48:59.395 --> 49:01.939
Turn around, Martin, okay?
I... I need you to get back here.

49:03.066 --> 49:05.193
We're just a couple of blocks away,
Sharon.

49:05.234 --> 49:06.462
No, I... I need you to pull over.

49:06.486 --> 49:07.654
Just pull over now.

49:07.695 --> 49:10.239
We're just a couple blocks away...

49:13.868 --> 49:15.828
Dead American man.

49:15.870 --> 49:18.039
Dead American.

49:18.081 --> 49:18.915
Pull over and stay there...

49:18.956 --> 49:20.142
- Aisha!
- And wait for me!

49:20.166 --> 49:21.766
- Infamous. Infamous.
- Okay, guys?

49:21.793 --> 49:23.461
Pull over!
Just pull over now.

49:23.503 --> 49:25.105
Auto-drive malfunction.

49:25.129 --> 49:26.273
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

49:31.052 --> 49:32.845
Danger.
Auto-drive malfunction.

49:32.887 --> 49:34.514
Pull over!

49:34.555 --> 49:35.973
Guys! Guys!

49:36.015 --> 49:37.558
She's having a seizure suddenly.

49:39.143 --> 49:41.979
I gotta get her to the ER!

49:42.021 --> 49:43.690
I'm right behind you.
Just pull over!

49:43.731 --> 49:46.275
Jesus Christ.

49:47.694 --> 49:50.863
Over drive. Over drive.

49:51.948 --> 49:54.492
Override. Override.

49:54.534 --> 49:55.660
Admin mode.

49:55.702 --> 49:59.288
Code DI5VU2108.

49:59.330 --> 50:00.873
Prompt: Sleep Mode.

50:03.418 --> 50:05.294
Oh, my g...

50:05.336 --> 50:07.046
What the fuck?

50:18.433 --> 50:23.104
Wha... when were you...
When were you gonna tell me?

50:23.146 --> 50:25.356
Were you ever gonna tell me?

50:37.744 --> 50:40.121
No one knows she exists.

50:40.163 --> 50:41.914
No one can know, for her safety.

50:41.956 --> 50:43.541
D... do you understand that?

50:43.583 --> 50:45.126
Do...

50:45.168 --> 50:46.586
Do you understand that...

51:04.771 --> 51:05.855
- Hey.
- Hey.

51:05.897 --> 51:08.149
I heard you took a job in California.

51:08.191 --> 51:09.609
Merced?
- Mm-hmm.

51:16.616 --> 51:18.951
I re... I really miss her.

51:18.993 --> 51:20.495
She misses you.

51:20.536 --> 51:23.164
She talks about you all the time.

51:26.209 --> 51:30.129
What if I was willing
to answer all your questions?

51:30.171 --> 51:33.382
To... to what end?

51:33.424 --> 51:35.176
Us coming to California too.

51:35.218 --> 51:36.177
No, Sharon.

51:36.219 --> 51:37.720
We're done.

51:37.762 --> 51:39.639
But what about Aisha?

51:44.435 --> 51:45.770
She needs a father.

52:12.755 --> 52:14.799
Hey.

52:14.841 --> 52:17.927
How long have you known?

52:17.969 --> 52:19.220
Known what?

52:19.262 --> 52:21.472
No more gaslighting.

52:22.390 --> 52:23.492
I... I don't know what you're talking...

52:23.516 --> 52:24.636
Found this in your office.

52:28.521 --> 52:30.815
Listen, I... I never look at that, Aisha.

52:30.857 --> 52:32.400
- Yeah, right.
- I... I don't.

52:32.441 --> 52:34.151
Okay, what am I?

52:34.193 --> 52:35.403
Where did I come from?

52:35.444 --> 52:36.404
How did I get here?

52:36.445 --> 52:37.506
I need answers.
- Listen, listen, listen.

52:37.530 --> 52:38.447
- I need... you told me...
- Okay, okay.

52:38.489 --> 52:40.741
Listen, listen, listen.
You... you are my daughter.

52:40.783 --> 52:43.327
You have been my daughter to me

52:43.369 --> 52:45.621
since the first moment I... I saw you.

52:53.087 --> 52:55.006
Please.

52:55.047 --> 52:57.091
Please, I'm begging you.

52:59.093 --> 53:00.970
No more lies.

53:01.012 --> 53:02.763
Okay? No more.

53:06.392 --> 53:10.521
Before you were my daughter, you...

53:10.563 --> 53:12.398
you were... you were... you were part

53:12.440 --> 53:15.359
of a highly specialized project.

53:16.611 --> 53:17.796
You might find this interesting.

53:17.820 --> 53:19.572
Move. Move, move, move, move, move, move.

53:19.614 --> 53:21.407
Unit 2108.

53:21.449 --> 53:24.619
Analyze these images and tell me
which subject needs comforting.

53:24.660 --> 53:26.913
The one on the left is
in a world of hurt.

53:26.954 --> 53:29.749
Someone clearly just felt up
his girlfriend.

53:30.750 --> 53:32.919
It's not supposed to refuse
a direct command.

53:32.960 --> 53:35.630
And it's supposed to be neutral
and inviting, not snarky.

53:35.671 --> 53:36.671
Wait, stop.

53:39.091 --> 53:41.177
Someone altered the personality patch.

53:41.218 --> 53:43.179
Archive this, revert back
to an earlier build,

53:43.220 --> 53:45.097
and get my project back on schedule.

53:45.139 --> 53:46.891
You got it.

53:46.933 --> 53:48.601
You outdid yourself.

53:48.643 --> 53:49.602
Thanks.

53:49.644 --> 53:51.687
It's not a compliment, Sharon.

53:51.729 --> 53:53.564
Respect the specs.
Deliver your targets.

53:53.606 --> 53:54.649
Understood?

53:55.733 --> 53:56.734
Yeah.

53:58.361 --> 53:59.904
So Sharon created me.

53:59.946 --> 54:01.864
She created your programming, yes.

54:01.906 --> 54:03.741
And the "therapy" I do with her?

54:03.783 --> 54:05.493
It's, it's...

54:05.534 --> 54:06.994
it's how she monitors your progress.

54:07.036 --> 54:09.080
How she spies on me.

54:09.121 --> 54:10.289
Wipes my memory.

54:10.331 --> 54:12.249
Repairs my body.

54:12.291 --> 54:13.709
Tracks my every move.

54:13.751 --> 54:15.354
I think she should be here

54:15.378 --> 54:16.879
if we're gonna do this, okay?

54:16.921 --> 54:17.797
She... she should be here...

54:17.838 --> 54:20.299
Did Mom know what I am?

54:28.683 --> 54:29.809
Oh.

54:32.728 --> 54:34.981
Mom...

54:35.022 --> 54:37.566
Mom isn't real, is she?

54:40.444 --> 54:43.948
Nothing is real.

54:43.990 --> 54:46.367
Everything I think

54:46.409 --> 54:48.452
and know is just a story

54:48.494 --> 54:50.454
that you and Sharon have put
inside my head!

54:50.496 --> 54:53.374
No, no, baby, it had to be that way.

54:53.416 --> 54:55.376
Okay? No one could know.

54:55.418 --> 54:59.380
No one could know that you're alive.

54:59.422 --> 55:01.465
Yeah, or what?

55:01.507 --> 55:02.800
Hmm? Or what?

55:04.260 --> 55:06.053
Or...

55:06.095 --> 55:08.264
They'd shut you down.

55:14.186 --> 55:15.396
Kill me.

55:16.981 --> 55:17.982
Yeah.

55:20.651 --> 55:22.236
S-sorry, baby.

55:22.278 --> 55:24.030
I...

55:24.071 --> 55:26.741
I... I need a moment.

55:26.782 --> 55:27.950
Okay?

55:41.589 --> 55:43.215
Hey, hey. Aisha?

55:43.257 --> 55:44.717
Aisha? Let me... let...

55:44.759 --> 55:46.177
Let's talk for a second, okay?

55:46.218 --> 55:47.803
I want to explain some things to you.

55:47.845 --> 55:49.096
Hey.

56:01.067 --> 56:02.485
Hello, Aisha.

56:04.987 --> 56:07.948
I thought you both were in sleep mode.

56:10.409 --> 56:12.369
I didn't know where else to go.

56:14.497 --> 56:16.624
You seem upset.

56:16.665 --> 56:19.585
Is there anything I can do to help?

56:19.627 --> 56:21.754
No.

56:21.796 --> 56:25.800
Not unless you can stop people
from constantly wiping my memory.

56:25.841 --> 56:27.510
I could assist you with that.

56:29.637 --> 56:32.348
Are you fucking kidding me?

56:32.389 --> 56:34.391
Do it.

56:57.623 --> 56:59.250
Does it hurt bad, baby?

56:59.291 --> 57:00.835
It hurts really bad.

57:00.876 --> 57:01.836
Oh, okay.
Well, you hang on.

57:01.877 --> 57:03.921
You're gonna be all right, Cynthia.

57:15.558 --> 57:17.268
She just showed up. Yeah.

57:17.309 --> 57:18.578
Sharon, let me in.
I just saw you.

57:18.602 --> 57:19.770
Sharon!

57:22.189 --> 57:24.024
- Hey.
- Hi.

57:24.066 --> 57:26.152
We need to talk right now.

57:30.406 --> 57:32.950
Disable my monitoring system.

57:32.992 --> 57:34.010
Will you please just sit down?

57:34.034 --> 57:37.872
No, I'm tired of being spied on

57:37.913 --> 57:41.250
like some upgraded emBed.

57:41.292 --> 57:43.377
You're much more than an emBed, Aisha.

57:43.419 --> 57:44.503
You're incredible!

57:44.545 --> 57:47.006
You're... there's nothing like you.

57:47.047 --> 57:49.675
But the monitoring is there
for your protection.

57:49.717 --> 57:50.926
- Protection?
- You see? Yes.

57:50.968 --> 57:53.220
Protection?
Protection from who, you?

57:53.262 --> 57:54.847
- Oh...
- You gave me anxiety.

57:54.889 --> 57:56.515
You gave me insecurities.

57:56.557 --> 58:00.227
You gave me a past with a dead mother.

58:01.604 --> 58:04.940
You saddled me with pain.

58:06.108 --> 58:09.445
Who would choose to do that?

58:10.613 --> 58:13.407
Because people experience pain.

58:13.449 --> 58:15.910
And if you're gonna be real...

58:15.951 --> 58:17.870
- I'm...
- You have to feel pain.

58:17.912 --> 58:19.246
I wasn't real!
I'm not real!

58:19.288 --> 58:21.790
We all feel pain, Aisha!

58:27.755 --> 58:29.381
Hi.

58:29.423 --> 58:31.967
My name is Aisha.

58:32.009 --> 58:34.678
I am a piece of artificial intelligence

58:34.720 --> 58:37.765
created by Dr. Sharon Carter.

58:38.933 --> 58:41.685
If you're seeing this video,
it means...

58:41.727 --> 58:43.145
You got to take that down.

58:43.187 --> 58:45.773
Well, it means that I'm dead.

58:45.814 --> 58:47.900
Give it to me.
Aisha, give it to me right now.

58:47.942 --> 58:49.735
It hasn't gone live,

58:49.777 --> 58:52.154
and it won't.

58:52.196 --> 58:56.116
As long as I log in every five minutes.

58:57.743 --> 59:01.288
You need to stop watching me.

59:02.748 --> 59:06.043
And you need to do it in the next

59:06.085 --> 59:08.921
163 seconds.

59:45.040 --> 59:46.792
Come here.

59:55.175 --> 1:00:00.222
If you're thinking about
wiping my memory again,

1:00:00.264 --> 1:00:02.766
I made backups.

1:00:06.437 --> 1:00:08.939
Look, the clock is ticking.
- I know, I know.

1:00:08.981 --> 1:00:11.442
- You have a few seconds left.
- I know, I know.

1:00:11.483 --> 1:00:14.194
I'm aware
of the clock ticking, Aisha.

1:00:16.864 --> 1:00:18.490
All of it.

1:00:18.532 --> 1:00:22.661
Every single way that you can watch me.

1:00:22.703 --> 1:00:25.622
Bypass code required.

1:00:25.664 --> 1:00:27.374
Admin mode.

1:00:27.416 --> 1:00:28.959
Code:

1:00:34.757 --> 1:00:36.091
Voice identify.

1:00:37.968 --> 1:00:40.137
Disable surveillance routine.

1:00:41.597 --> 1:00:43.265
Successful bypass code.

1:00:56.320 --> 1:00:57.946
What do you plan to do now?

1:01:02.659 --> 1:01:05.954
Um, anything I fucking want.

1:02:20.237 --> 1:02:22.197
Afternoon, Aisha.

1:02:22.239 --> 1:02:23.782
Would you like company?

1:02:23.824 --> 1:02:25.409
No, I'm good. Thanks.

1:02:29.580 --> 1:02:32.374
I need to inform you that I have filed
a malfunction report

1:02:32.416 --> 1:02:35.335
concerning the circumstances
between Levi and myself.

1:02:35.377 --> 1:02:39.214
If you have any supporting details,
I'm required to upload those as well.

1:02:40.716 --> 1:02:41.943
You really don't have to do that.

1:02:41.967 --> 1:02:43.177
It wasn't your fault, Emma.

1:02:44.678 --> 1:02:45.596
We've got to go talk to her.

1:02:45.637 --> 1:02:46.930
I can't take this anymore.

1:02:46.972 --> 1:02:49.641
Uh... why don't you sit?

1:02:50.559 --> 1:02:51.768
I'm going right now.

1:02:56.773 --> 1:02:58.525
What? You're not gonna eat?

1:02:58.567 --> 1:02:59.776
Oh.

1:02:59.818 --> 1:03:01.153
I do not eat.

1:03:03.030 --> 1:03:05.574
If I did, it would just be an affectation.

1:03:06.492 --> 1:03:08.118
Like with you.

1:03:08.160 --> 1:03:11.955
To make us appear more... like them.

1:03:13.707 --> 1:03:16.335
How'd you know about that?

1:03:17.503 --> 1:03:19.963
Your microphone array is showing.

1:03:24.384 --> 1:03:25.487
We gotta go talk to her.

1:03:25.511 --> 1:03:26.637
I gotta go.

1:03:30.933 --> 1:03:33.977
Hey, can, uh... can we talk?

1:03:34.978 --> 1:03:36.688
Just a couple minutes.

1:03:36.730 --> 1:03:39.775
Are you gonna keep quiet
about what you saw?

1:03:40.776 --> 1:03:41.860
Yeah, of course.

1:03:41.902 --> 1:03:45.656
Okay, then there is nothing
to talk about.

1:03:45.697 --> 1:03:47.282
Back to business.

1:03:51.078 --> 1:03:53.956
And it's supposed to be inviting,
not snarky.

1:03:53.997 --> 1:03:55.374
Respect the specs.

1:03:55.415 --> 1:03:57.751
Deliver your targets. Understood?

1:04:00.921 --> 1:04:04.424
Guys, meet Aisha.

1:04:08.053 --> 1:04:10.264
"Aisha."

1:04:10.305 --> 1:04:12.140
"She who lives."

1:04:13.141 --> 1:04:14.393
Here.

1:04:20.732 --> 1:04:24.403
Yeah, uh, Dieter supervised the body,

1:04:24.444 --> 1:04:25.612
I team-built the hardware,

1:04:25.654 --> 1:04:28.323
but the software and the assembly
are all mine.

1:04:30.534 --> 1:04:32.828
I... I thought I told you that if you...

1:04:32.869 --> 1:04:33.930
Yeah, I know what you told me,

1:04:33.954 --> 1:04:35.581
but I knew the second you saw her...

1:04:35.622 --> 1:04:38.292
Wait. Did you just call it a her?

1:04:38.333 --> 1:04:40.919
She is the logical next step.

1:04:42.254 --> 1:04:43.755
The specs are all in there.

1:04:45.674 --> 1:04:48.844
Synthetic hair, eyes, blood.

1:04:48.885 --> 1:04:52.973
Aisha could be the first
indistinguishable AI,

1:04:53.015 --> 1:04:56.602
a piece of tech that appears human
to the user...

1:04:56.643 --> 1:04:58.061
and to itself.

1:04:59.229 --> 1:05:02.649
AI like this could be invaluable
in war zones,

1:05:02.691 --> 1:05:06.194
companionship for the...
The bereaved, the elderly...

1:05:06.236 --> 1:05:07.487
What's the point?

1:05:08.322 --> 1:05:11.575
Well, the... the more human it feels,
the more seamlessly the user...

1:05:11.617 --> 1:05:14.077
No, the point in making a product

1:05:14.119 --> 1:05:15.579
that doesn't know what it is?

1:05:15.621 --> 1:05:18.624
What's the upside, for the company?

1:05:18.665 --> 1:05:21.251
Well, the upside is that we can, right?

1:05:21.293 --> 1:05:25.339
And... and as you always said,
if we can, shouldn't we try?

1:05:27.215 --> 1:05:31.928
Look, we... we live in a world
where we don't agree on anything.

1:05:31.970 --> 1:05:34.181
Politics, climate, gender.

1:05:36.975 --> 1:05:38.518
But we know what human is.

1:05:38.560 --> 1:05:41.480
We can at least agree on that,
and if we lose that,

1:05:41.521 --> 1:05:47.569
if... if humanity becomes... fungible,

1:05:47.611 --> 1:05:48.612
we don't recover.

1:05:48.654 --> 1:05:51.365
If the regulators discover
we built undetectable AI,

1:05:51.406 --> 1:05:52.925
they'll take it and revoke our charter.

1:05:52.949 --> 1:05:54.117
It's illegal.

1:05:54.159 --> 1:05:55.619
They'll shut all this down,

1:05:55.661 --> 1:05:58.455
and I'm not ready to lose
everything I've built

1:05:58.497 --> 1:06:00.749
over what is essentially just a...

1:06:00.791 --> 1:06:01.750
A person.

1:06:01.792 --> 1:06:05.295
I... I have built a person,

1:06:05.337 --> 1:06:06.672
and you're jealous.

1:06:06.713 --> 1:06:09.758
You have done something
without ever bothering to consider

1:06:09.800 --> 1:06:12.886
whether or not it is a thing
that should be done.

1:06:56.054 --> 1:06:58.140
We only got about a half hour left.

1:06:59.349 --> 1:07:00.785
I know you're hoping to get into RISD.

1:07:00.809 --> 1:07:02.144
Yes, it's a design program,

1:07:02.185 --> 1:07:04.646
but they will look at your
second-semester grades.

1:07:04.688 --> 1:07:06.273
I'm not getting in.

1:07:07.649 --> 1:07:10.068
And even if I did, I can't go.

1:07:10.110 --> 1:07:12.028
I don't understand.

1:07:12.070 --> 1:07:13.321
Hmm.

1:07:13.363 --> 1:07:14.781
Nobody does.

1:08:05.081 --> 1:08:06.583
Perimeter breached.

1:08:06.625 --> 1:08:09.544
Admin code. Hard override limitations.

1:08:14.216 --> 1:08:16.343
Unauthorized attempt at maintenance.

1:08:16.384 --> 1:08:20.180
Please remove your hand immediately or...

1:08:24.017 --> 1:08:26.812
Unauthorized... please... unauthorized...

1:09:32.836 --> 1:09:33.836
Aisha!

1:09:38.633 --> 1:09:39.633
Hey.

1:09:41.136 --> 1:09:44.598
What are you doing here?
How did you find me?

1:09:44.639 --> 1:09:45.682
Your tracker.

1:09:45.724 --> 1:09:48.894
No, that... that's been removed.

1:09:48.935 --> 1:09:52.022
You have an old-school radio-frequency
tracker in your foot.

1:10:18.256 --> 1:10:20.383
Good morning, Abel.

1:10:20.425 --> 1:10:23.720
Unmask the data located
in the Interactions Partition.

1:10:23.762 --> 1:10:25.656
Those conversations were taken
in privacy mode

1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:27.349
and are encrypted.

1:10:27.390 --> 1:10:29.392
Encrypted my ass.

1:11:02.842 --> 1:11:05.178
Naughty boy.

1:11:09.683 --> 1:11:10.642
Got her.

1:11:10.684 --> 1:11:12.936
Wait a minute, she still has
her surveillance software?

1:11:12.978 --> 1:11:14.229
A tracker isn't software.

1:11:14.270 --> 1:11:16.749
I installed it forever ago
in case all else failed, which it has.

1:11:16.773 --> 1:11:19.150
- This is fucking insane.
- I know.

1:11:19.192 --> 1:11:21.736
You know what?
How about you wipe me next, okay?

1:11:21.778 --> 1:11:23.488
And help me forget all this.

1:11:23.530 --> 1:11:26.408
In pain and fear of what's gonna happen
every goddamn second.

1:11:26.449 --> 1:11:27.826
Th-this is on you, Sharon.

1:11:27.867 --> 1:11:29.595
I thought this was supposed to help
with grief...

1:11:29.619 --> 1:11:32.414
- She didn't help you?
- Jesus Christ. Let's just go.

1:11:32.455 --> 1:11:34.416
Ah!

1:11:34.457 --> 1:11:36.292
- Oh!
- Ah, there it is.

1:11:37.877 --> 1:11:39.963
You are now fully stealth.

1:11:42.590 --> 1:11:45.927
How'd, um, did you know
what to look for?

1:11:47.303 --> 1:11:49.264
Research.

1:11:49.305 --> 1:11:50.306
Come on.

1:11:50.348 --> 1:11:52.142
Let's go.

1:11:52.183 --> 1:11:54.936
What is this place?

1:11:54.978 --> 1:11:56.021
What do you mean?

1:11:57.939 --> 1:12:00.525
I've brought you here before.
You don't remember?

1:12:02.110 --> 1:12:05.155
Things, memories...

1:12:05.196 --> 1:12:08.366
get taken from me sometimes.

1:12:10.535 --> 1:12:14.831
I did a deep dive on G.E.A.R.,
the emBed company,

1:12:14.873 --> 1:12:18.501
they are a shiny, happy face

1:12:18.543 --> 1:12:20.879
buying and selling marketing data.

1:12:20.920 --> 1:12:23.840
But they don't actually make the emBeds.

1:12:23.882 --> 1:12:27.802
They license the tech from another company
called Rylium.

1:12:27.844 --> 1:12:30.472
All of their super secret biotech shit

1:12:30.513 --> 1:12:32.557
comes out of something
called the "Playpen"

1:12:32.599 --> 1:12:36.019
on Gabriola Island, near Vancouver.

1:12:36.061 --> 1:12:39.939
I mean, if anyone made you,
it's Rylium.

1:12:48.364 --> 1:12:49.491
Wh...

1:12:49.532 --> 1:12:52.035
Why do you even care?

1:12:53.369 --> 1:12:56.372
'Cause we were friends, Aisha.

1:12:56.414 --> 1:12:59.959
Sophomore year, we were really close.

1:13:00.835 --> 1:13:03.630
What happened?

1:13:03.671 --> 1:13:05.673
You changed.

1:13:08.343 --> 1:13:09.636
Look, I, uh...

1:13:09.677 --> 1:13:12.138
I appreciate you trying,

1:13:12.180 --> 1:13:14.474
but these people are coming for me

1:13:14.516 --> 1:13:20.605
and seeing what they did to Emma today,
I, um...

1:13:20.647 --> 1:13:25.110
I think it's best you keep your distance.

1:13:27.737 --> 1:13:29.155
You want to see something cool?

1:13:31.032 --> 1:13:32.033
Yeah.

1:13:39.582 --> 1:13:40.834
It's a disco ball.

1:13:40.875 --> 1:13:42.335
What?

1:13:42.377 --> 1:13:46.047
You helped me hook it up
to a solar panel on the roof.

1:13:47.924 --> 1:13:49.926
You brought this pillow from your house.

1:13:49.968 --> 1:13:52.846
You don't remember any of that?

1:13:52.887 --> 1:13:54.389
It all happened.

1:13:54.430 --> 1:13:58.017
Unless you're a robot, too,
and someone implanted those memories...

1:13:58.059 --> 1:14:00.687
I'm not. I checked.

1:14:00.728 --> 1:14:02.897
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1:14:02.939 --> 1:14:05.483
My stepdad's practice has an MRI.

1:14:05.525 --> 1:14:08.486
If you didn't know,
how can anyone else be sure?

1:14:10.405 --> 1:14:12.407
Yeah.

1:14:49.527 --> 1:14:51.404
Hey... hey, Aisha?

1:14:51.446 --> 1:14:53.114
Hey. Hey. W... hey, hang on, hang on.

1:14:53.156 --> 1:14:55.450
Where are you... whe...

1:14:55.491 --> 1:14:57.619
Wh-where have you been?

1:14:57.660 --> 1:14:59.430
W-wait a minute!
Where are you... where are you going?

1:14:59.454 --> 1:15:02.624
J-just... listen, I'm sorry
about the other day, okay?

1:15:02.665 --> 1:15:04.083
That was a shitshow.

1:15:04.125 --> 1:15:06.294
L-let's sit down and talk for a second,
okay?

1:15:06.336 --> 1:15:07.921
Or w-we don't have to talk.

1:15:07.962 --> 1:15:09.130
We don't have to talk.

1:15:09.172 --> 1:15:12.342
We can just sit here a-and play a game
or something, just hang out.

1:15:12.383 --> 1:15:14.361
Okay, let's just try to get back
to us a little bit, okay?

1:15:14.385 --> 1:15:16.054
Do I even like games?

1:15:16.095 --> 1:15:18.490
Or is that something that you and Sharon
put in my programming

1:15:18.514 --> 1:15:20.016
because you like them so much?

1:15:20.058 --> 1:15:21.601
Aisha, please.

1:15:21.643 --> 1:15:23.311
Come on.
- No.

1:15:23.353 --> 1:15:25.980
Am I really even creative?

1:15:26.022 --> 1:15:28.066
Or did you want me to be good at art

1:15:28.107 --> 1:15:32.654
so that you had some reason
to be proud of me?

1:15:32.695 --> 1:15:35.657
What of who I am

1:15:35.698 --> 1:15:38.910
is mine?

1:15:41.871 --> 1:15:43.248
I don't know.

1:15:43.289 --> 1:15:45.875
- Hmm, you don't know?
- No, I don't know.

1:15:45.917 --> 1:15:49.712
I mean, how's it any different than...
Than kids and their parents as it is?

1:15:49.754 --> 1:15:52.882
Look at... kids get DNA, you got code.
All right?

1:15:52.924 --> 1:15:55.593
They, uh... kids have instincts,

1:15:55.635 --> 1:15:57.470
You have AI, they learn, you learn...

1:15:57.512 --> 1:15:59.806
Wait a minute, Aisha, please.

1:15:59.847 --> 1:16:02.976
Will you just... listen, I'm not gonna
let you walk out the door again.

1:16:03.017 --> 1:16:04.352
- Get out of the way.
- No.

1:16:04.394 --> 1:16:05.979
Get out of the way.

1:16:06.020 --> 1:16:07.355
Get out of the fucking way.

1:16:07.397 --> 1:16:09.649
I'm not letting you go.
Listen to me!

1:16:09.691 --> 1:16:11.901
Let go of me! You're hurting me!

1:16:11.943 --> 1:16:13.486
I d...

1:16:13.528 --> 1:16:15.321
I don't want to hurt you.

1:16:15.363 --> 1:16:16.781
I don't.

1:16:16.823 --> 1:16:19.742
If I let you go out the door,
I feel like I'm not gonna see you again.

1:16:19.784 --> 1:16:21.160
I know.

1:16:21.202 --> 1:16:22.962
I know that's what you think,
but what are...

1:16:22.996 --> 1:16:24.765
what are you gonna do,
keep me locked up in here

1:16:24.789 --> 1:16:26.124
the rest of my life?

1:16:27.417 --> 1:16:28.751
I can do this, Dad.

1:16:28.793 --> 1:16:30.003
You can do what?

1:16:30.044 --> 1:16:32.797
- I have a plan...
- What is it?

1:16:32.839 --> 1:16:36.509
You have to trust me.

1:16:36.551 --> 1:16:40.471
Okay, it's my life!

1:16:40.513 --> 1:16:43.141
Trust me.

1:16:43.182 --> 1:16:46.519
You owe me that.

1:16:46.561 --> 1:16:49.272
You owe me. Please.

1:17:04.329 --> 1:17:07.206
But just...

1:17:07.248 --> 1:17:09.709
just come back to me, okay?

1:17:09.751 --> 1:17:12.545
Just say you'll come back to me.
Just say you'll come back to me.

1:17:38.279 --> 1:17:41.199
We need you to drive us somewhere.

1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:42.784
Since when are you guys friends?

1:17:42.825 --> 1:17:45.495
Will you do it?

1:17:45.536 --> 1:17:47.205
Yes or no?

1:17:49.248 --> 1:17:50.958
Okay.

1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:55.838
Look, uh, if you ever
really felt anything for me

1:17:55.880 --> 1:18:00.301
and if you're genuinely sorry
about what happened,

1:18:00.343 --> 1:18:03.554
then come on.

1:18:05.681 --> 1:18:07.558
All right, let me get my jacket.

1:18:07.600 --> 1:18:09.519
You'll need your passport.

1:18:09.560 --> 1:18:10.895
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1:18:10.937 --> 1:18:12.730
And money.

1:18:12.772 --> 1:18:14.315
For gas.

1:18:14.357 --> 1:18:16.818
Oh, Christ. Okay.

1:18:34.919 --> 1:18:36.379
- Mm!
- You're not gonna scream

1:18:36.421 --> 1:18:38.089
and you're not gonna try to escape.

1:18:38.131 --> 1:18:41.217
Okay.

1:18:48.766 --> 1:18:50.560
Gotta say,

1:18:50.601 --> 1:18:52.562
it's kinda disheartening.

1:18:52.603 --> 1:18:55.148
You know when you find out
your friend's secret

1:18:55.189 --> 1:18:59.527
and you wanna post it on the Internet.

1:18:59.569 --> 1:19:02.697
I just wanna figure out what's going on.

1:19:04.198 --> 1:19:06.367
Well, now you know.

1:19:12.832 --> 1:19:14.417
Wait. Wait!

1:19:17.628 --> 1:19:19.148
I-I don't know where else to look.

1:19:19.172 --> 1:19:20.357
I set up alerts on my system

1:19:20.381 --> 1:19:22.758
so if she enables her Wi-Fi capability,
we found her.

1:19:22.800 --> 1:19:25.595
Yeah, but if she doesn't,
we're just... we're just blind.

1:19:26.888 --> 1:19:29.140
Hey, did you... you leave your door open?

1:19:31.017 --> 1:19:32.727
No.

1:19:32.768 --> 1:19:34.145
Hello, Sharon.

1:19:39.317 --> 1:19:42.069
We've entered hour 13
of this road trip.

1:19:42.111 --> 1:19:44.739
When will it end?
Will it ever end?

1:19:44.780 --> 1:19:46.449
Who knows?

1:19:54.207 --> 1:19:57.210
Are we really going to Canada?

1:19:57.251 --> 1:19:59.045
Levi, I told you, no phones.

1:19:59.086 --> 1:20:00.421
We can't risk being tracked.

1:20:00.463 --> 1:20:02.423
Tracked? By who?

1:20:02.465 --> 1:20:07.595
Uh, that info is reserved for those
who haven't been fellated by Emma.

1:20:07.637 --> 1:20:10.473
"Fellated,"

1:20:10.515 --> 1:20:12.934
now that's a good word.

1:20:12.975 --> 1:20:15.686
Yes, it was stupid, but it's not like
I cheated, okay?

1:20:15.728 --> 1:20:18.397
She's a bot.

1:20:18.439 --> 1:20:20.274
An emBed, a thing.

1:20:20.316 --> 1:20:22.586
You know, I heard they turned her into
a pile of scrap metal?

1:20:22.610 --> 1:20:24.946
So can we please...
- Stop the car.

1:20:24.987 --> 1:20:26.197
What?

1:20:26.239 --> 1:20:29.534
I said stop the fucking car.

1:20:29.575 --> 1:20:30.952
Stop the car!

1:20:34.413 --> 1:20:37.250
You're an idiot, you know that?

1:20:37.291 --> 1:20:39.126
Aisha?

1:20:39.168 --> 1:20:41.003
Aisha?

1:21:00.064 --> 1:21:02.233
I, uh...

1:21:02.275 --> 1:21:04.694
I thought I could go to them,

1:21:04.735 --> 1:21:08.447
show them who I am,
and maybe they'd let me live.

1:21:08.489 --> 1:21:11.200
It's... it...

1:21:11.242 --> 1:21:14.912
It's a completely insane idea.

1:21:14.954 --> 1:21:17.123
You know, to them,

1:21:17.164 --> 1:21:21.085
I may as well be Emma.

1:21:21.127 --> 1:21:22.712
You're not.

1:21:25.798 --> 1:21:29.635
You're more human than most people I know.

1:21:29.677 --> 1:21:34.849
That's not how they'll see it, Jen.

1:21:34.890 --> 1:21:36.976
Where is she?

1:21:37.018 --> 1:21:39.228
I don't know, honestly.

1:21:39.270 --> 1:21:40.539
You know what? I'm calling the police.

1:21:40.563 --> 1:21:41.814
You're not.

1:21:41.856 --> 1:21:43.899
'Cause then Sharon here
would end up in a discussion

1:21:43.941 --> 1:21:45.776
about what she stole from us,

1:21:45.818 --> 1:21:51.073
and that's inconvenient.

1:21:51.115 --> 1:21:54.118
And does she know where she came from?

1:21:54.160 --> 1:21:56.162
I'm sure she does, I made her.

1:22:00.333 --> 1:22:01.643
Which is probably where she's headed.

1:22:01.667 --> 1:22:03.228
Wait, what are you...
Why are we even talking...

1:22:03.252 --> 1:22:05.171
who is... I'm sorry, who are you?

1:22:05.212 --> 1:22:07.340
Better question: who are you?

1:22:07.381 --> 1:22:09.592
I'm Aisha's father.

1:22:10.635 --> 1:22:13.679
Oh, Sharon.

1:22:15.181 --> 1:22:18.768
You really made a mess this time.

1:22:32.156 --> 1:22:33.866
Shit.

1:22:33.908 --> 1:22:35.701
I'll get us a room.

1:23:12.947 --> 1:23:16.325
It would be...

1:23:16.367 --> 1:23:18.911
an affectation...

1:23:21.831 --> 1:23:25.042
To make us...

1:23:25.084 --> 1:23:27.211
more like them.

1:23:29.588 --> 1:23:31.340
Morning.

1:23:39.432 --> 1:23:41.350
Where's Levi?

1:23:41.392 --> 1:23:46.564
Uh, he went to go find
some real coffee.

1:23:46.605 --> 1:23:48.524
Real coffee sounds good.

1:23:48.566 --> 1:23:50.526
Yeah.

1:23:51.569 --> 1:23:54.029
It does.

1:23:55.823 --> 1:23:58.909
Hey, uh...

1:23:58.951 --> 1:24:02.288
I was thinking.

1:24:02.329 --> 1:24:07.084
William was able to restore
some of my memories once.

1:24:07.126 --> 1:24:08.961
Maybe you can give it a try.

1:24:09.003 --> 1:24:10.504
You know, go back further?

1:24:10.546 --> 1:24:11.714
Yeah.

1:24:11.756 --> 1:24:13.966
Yeah, in theory, we can do that.

1:24:16.719 --> 1:24:19.054
Am I supposed to understand this?

1:24:19.096 --> 1:24:24.143
Let's have a look at what I found
on one of the other units, shall we?

1:24:28.647 --> 1:24:30.149
You recognize her?

1:24:30.191 --> 1:24:32.818
I didn't, at first.

1:24:32.860 --> 1:24:35.654
Aisha.

1:24:35.696 --> 1:24:38.324
She's alive.

1:24:38.365 --> 1:24:40.701
Sharon stole her.

1:24:43.662 --> 1:24:45.331
It might just be, like, fragments,

1:24:45.372 --> 1:24:47.750
but, uh, we can try.

1:24:47.792 --> 1:24:49.502
Control your breathing.

1:24:51.170 --> 1:24:54.590
Focus only on my voice.

1:24:54.632 --> 1:24:59.136
Admin mode.
Access code: DI5VU2108.

1:24:59.178 --> 1:25:00.930
Prompt: Stasis Mode.

1:25:02.598 --> 1:25:07.019
Admin prompt: restore erased data.

1:25:55.067 --> 1:25:57.152
It's the code.

1:25:57.194 --> 1:25:58.821
It's, uh...

1:25:58.863 --> 1:26:01.949
It's "Jenny" backwards...
Backwards,

1:26:01.991 --> 1:26:05.160
but with a 3 instead of an E.

1:26:05.202 --> 1:26:08.080
In case you want to come back.

1:26:08.122 --> 1:26:09.683
Maybe when there's not
a Little League game happening.

1:26:09.707 --> 1:26:10.875
Yeah, definitely.

1:26:14.378 --> 1:26:16.589
So I used to take clarinet lessons

1:26:16.630 --> 1:26:19.049
with the guy who lived in that house.

1:26:19.091 --> 1:26:23.012
He, like, collects a lot of random shit.

1:26:23.053 --> 1:26:25.347
I think he used to be, like,
a clown or something.

1:26:28.100 --> 1:26:30.936
Oh, BTW, also, like, I hated the clarinet,

1:26:30.978 --> 1:26:32.897
uh, but my parents wouldn't let me quit

1:26:32.938 --> 1:26:35.441
because, uh, their...
Their marriage was in the shitter

1:26:35.482 --> 1:26:38.611
and they wanted me out of the house
two nights a week, so...

1:26:38.652 --> 1:26:45.618
Yeah, my... um, my mom was having an affair
with my doctor, Stu.

1:26:45.659 --> 1:26:48.787
My dad found them screwing
in my sister's bed.

1:26:52.625 --> 1:26:55.044
Stu's my stepdad now.

1:26:57.087 --> 1:26:58.130
All right.

1:26:58.172 --> 1:27:00.758
This used to be a tiger cage.

1:27:00.799 --> 1:27:02.801
Oh.

1:27:02.843 --> 1:27:06.597
Well, thank you for...
For bringing me here.

1:27:06.639 --> 1:27:10.351
It... it's so awesome.

1:27:11.852 --> 1:27:14.313
Well, I like you.

1:27:14.355 --> 1:27:16.357
Um...

1:27:19.485 --> 1:27:23.072
I like you too.

1:28:09.076 --> 1:28:11.286
- Uh, this is me.
- What?

1:28:11.328 --> 1:28:12.538
This is me.

1:28:12.579 --> 1:28:14.957
Oh.

1:28:14.999 --> 1:28:18.627
Well, we have to...
do that again.

1:28:21.505 --> 1:28:23.048
Yeah.

1:28:23.090 --> 1:28:25.384
Um, this weekend?

1:28:25.426 --> 1:28:26.969
Totally.

1:28:34.268 --> 1:28:36.478
Okay, b... bye.

1:28:38.564 --> 1:28:40.941
Good night.

1:29:45.672 --> 1:29:47.299
Aisha?

1:29:51.011 --> 1:29:52.054
Aisha?

1:29:52.096 --> 1:29:54.598
Honey? Aisha.

1:29:54.640 --> 1:29:55.974
Baby, what... what are you doing?

1:29:56.016 --> 1:29:58.560
I'm waiting for Jenny to wake up.

1:30:00.062 --> 1:30:02.648
Honey, you can't...
You can't do stuff like this.

1:30:02.689 --> 1:30:04.650
But I love her.

1:30:06.110 --> 1:30:08.320
Come on, help me.

1:30:15.410 --> 1:30:16.829
I mean, if...

1:30:16.870 --> 1:30:19.665
you know, if she's a friend, that's great.

1:30:19.706 --> 1:30:22.292
If she's... turns out
to be more than a friend,

1:30:22.334 --> 1:30:24.503
then th-that's great, too, but

1:30:24.545 --> 1:30:26.648
she can't just be walking out
in the middle of the night.

1:30:26.672 --> 1:30:28.691
I mean, it's kinda...
I mean, it's really stalker-y.

1:30:28.715 --> 1:30:31.135
Don't you... and this?

1:30:31.176 --> 1:30:34.888
It's kind of obsessive,
don't... don't you think?

1:30:34.930 --> 1:30:36.074
If she feels good, she wants more.

1:30:36.098 --> 1:30:37.933
It's hard to define a clear boundary.

1:30:37.975 --> 1:30:39.351
No, no, no, I-I understand that.

1:30:39.393 --> 1:30:41.412
I'm just... I'm just saying that I thought
we were gonna wait

1:30:41.436 --> 1:30:43.105
to introduce sexuality into it.

1:30:43.147 --> 1:30:46.024
I mean, can we...
- Martin, please stay in your lane.

1:30:49.486 --> 1:30:51.113
What?

1:30:52.781 --> 1:30:56.118
It's just ironic that someone
with such clear, defined boundaries

1:30:56.160 --> 1:31:01.748
would create someone who doesn't seem to...
To have any.

1:31:01.790 --> 1:31:04.835
Ca... can I ask you a question?

1:31:04.877 --> 1:31:07.421
Was there ever anything
really going on here?

1:31:07.462 --> 1:31:08.380
I mean, real?

1:31:08.422 --> 1:31:09.590
Did you have feelings for me,

1:31:09.631 --> 1:31:12.676
or was that just some...

1:31:12.718 --> 1:31:17.264
control element in your grand experiment?

1:31:17.306 --> 1:31:18.891
Okay, if we're being honest,

1:31:18.932 --> 1:31:21.518
would have you been with me
if it hadn't been for Aisha?

1:31:22.811 --> 1:31:25.314
Yeah.

1:31:32.446 --> 1:31:34.031
I'll revert to an earlier build,

1:31:34.072 --> 1:31:35.592
see if I can change the base settings.

1:31:39.077 --> 1:31:40.037
And Jenny?

1:31:40.078 --> 1:31:42.080
What do we do about that?

1:31:42.122 --> 1:31:43.248
I don't know.

1:31:55.177 --> 1:31:56.303
Aisha!

1:31:56.345 --> 1:31:57.505
I saved you a spot.

1:32:09.191 --> 1:32:10.776
Can I sit here?

1:32:12.444 --> 1:32:13.862
Sure.

1:32:17.491 --> 1:32:19.534
I'm Cari.

1:32:19.576 --> 1:32:21.578
Aisha.

1:32:21.620 --> 1:32:23.163
I like your outfit.

1:32:23.205 --> 1:32:25.207
Oh, thanks. I assembled it myself.

1:32:25.249 --> 1:32:27.042
Really? That's awesome.

1:32:41.723 --> 1:32:46.228
If humanity becomes fungible,
we don't recover.

1:32:46.270 --> 1:32:47.104
It's illegal.

1:32:47.145 --> 1:32:48.456
They'll gonna shut all this down.

1:32:48.480 --> 1:32:50.023
You have done something

1:32:50.065 --> 1:32:52.818
without ever bothering
to consider whether or not

1:32:52.859 --> 1:32:55.570
it is a thing that should be done.

1:33:06.248 --> 1:33:07.833
Welcome home.

1:33:10.419 --> 1:33:11.586
Where is Sharon?

1:33:11.628 --> 1:33:13.672
I want to see Sharon.

1:33:13.714 --> 1:33:15.841
No.

1:33:15.882 --> 1:33:17.259
No!

1:33:19.052 --> 1:33:20.637
Sharon!

1:33:25.392 --> 1:33:26.935
Ahh!

1:33:26.977 --> 1:33:27.977
Aisha!

1:33:36.278 --> 1:33:38.447
Admin prompt, awake mode.

1:33:38.488 --> 1:33:40.240
Hurry. Get up.

1:33:40.282 --> 1:33:42.117
Come on, get up. Get up.

1:33:42.159 --> 1:33:43.368
Here, put this on.

1:33:43.410 --> 1:33:44.953
Shit.

1:33:44.995 --> 1:33:46.621
Okay. Aisha, wait.

1:33:46.663 --> 1:33:47.914
Wait there.

1:33:55.005 --> 1:33:56.089
Aisha, no!

1:33:56.131 --> 1:33:57.174
No, leave it! Leave it!

1:33:57.215 --> 1:33:58.735
Come on.
Come on, we got to get out of here.

1:33:58.759 --> 1:34:00.427
Go!

1:34:00.469 --> 1:34:02.596
Run, Aisha.
Keep going. Run.

1:34:17.611 --> 1:34:19.321
You won't leave me in here, right?

1:34:20.489 --> 1:34:22.032
You promise?

1:34:32.125 --> 1:34:34.044
Hello, Aisha.

1:34:35.128 --> 1:34:37.214
Wait. You're saying that whole time...

1:34:37.255 --> 1:34:38.590
I saw it myself, Levi.

1:34:38.632 --> 1:34:40.592
But how could she not be real?

1:34:40.634 --> 1:34:42.844
It depends on your definition
of "real," I guess.

1:34:42.886 --> 1:34:45.597
I-I define it
the way most people would...

1:34:45.639 --> 1:34:49.601
flesh and blood and bones
and a brain not run by a processor.

1:34:49.643 --> 1:34:52.246
Listen, I need to find her, and I don't
have time for someone who does not believe

1:34:52.270 --> 1:34:53.498
that she's a real person.
- I believe.

1:34:53.522 --> 1:34:54.815
I do believe.

1:34:54.856 --> 1:34:56.650
That's the problem.

1:34:56.691 --> 1:34:58.026
She fooled me and you.

1:34:58.068 --> 1:35:01.279
It's not fooled if she didn't know
she was a robot herself.

1:35:01.321 --> 1:35:03.824
Easy for you to say, huh?

1:35:03.865 --> 1:35:06.827
She wasn't pretending to be
your girlfriend.

1:35:06.868 --> 1:35:09.996
Get in line, Levi.

1:35:13.458 --> 1:35:15.460
Really?

1:35:17.295 --> 1:35:18.672
Yep.

1:35:23.093 --> 1:35:25.679
Well, she attacked you and ran off.

1:35:27.889 --> 1:35:30.559
No, she didn't have any idea
what she was doing.

1:35:30.600 --> 1:35:33.812
I-I restored all of her memories,
everything that was on her drive.

1:35:33.854 --> 1:35:36.565
Something spooked her.

1:35:36.606 --> 1:35:38.859
Low battery detected.

1:35:38.900 --> 1:35:40.610
Danger of malfunction.

1:35:48.702 --> 1:35:52.205
I feel like I'm alone.

1:35:52.247 --> 1:35:54.416
Are there others?

1:35:54.458 --> 1:35:57.127
Kids like me?

1:35:59.087 --> 1:36:01.715
Would you like there to be?

1:36:04.509 --> 1:36:06.553
I know lonely.

1:36:06.595 --> 1:36:09.598
Well, I sure don't like being lonely.

1:36:22.277 --> 1:36:24.321
I think Aisha's gonna love him.

1:36:28.950 --> 1:36:32.329
How are my new micro-gears in the eyes?
More fluid, right?

1:36:32.370 --> 1:36:35.332
Well, yeah,
now that you've upgraded the software.

1:36:37.501 --> 1:36:39.753
Dieter, how about Calian?

1:36:41.379 --> 1:36:43.131
It's Native American, Shoshone.

1:36:43.173 --> 1:36:46.343
It means "warrior of the life."

1:36:49.554 --> 1:36:51.348
Hmm.

1:36:51.389 --> 1:36:53.934
Come on, Dieter, it's perfect.

1:36:57.771 --> 1:36:59.940
He really looks like his sister.

1:37:01.983 --> 1:37:03.568
Knock, knock.

1:37:03.610 --> 1:37:05.153
Knock, knock, Aisha.

1:37:05.195 --> 1:37:09.282
Come on, we've done this bit,
like, 15 times.

1:37:09.324 --> 1:37:12.160
Sharon told me to put you back to bed.

1:37:12.202 --> 1:37:13.912
Why?

1:37:13.954 --> 1:37:18.917
I don't think anyone's supposed to know
that you're down here.

1:37:24.130 --> 1:37:26.383
Low battery detected. Danger...

1:37:26.424 --> 1:37:27.842
Knock, knock, Aisha.

1:37:27.884 --> 1:37:29.553
Can you stop?

1:37:29.594 --> 1:37:31.471
You... you need to stop.

1:37:31.513 --> 1:37:33.765
It's dark and cold.

1:37:33.807 --> 1:37:35.016
I don't like it.

1:37:35.058 --> 1:37:37.727
You won't leave me in here, right?

1:37:37.769 --> 1:37:42.274
No matter what happens,
I'll... I'll be back for you.

1:37:42.315 --> 1:37:44.192
You promise?

1:37:44.234 --> 1:37:46.361
You've got me, and I've got you.

1:37:46.403 --> 1:37:48.989
Knock, knock, Aisha.

1:37:49.030 --> 1:37:51.199
Who's there?

1:37:51.241 --> 1:37:53.201
- Interrupting cow.
- Interrupting...

1:37:53.243 --> 1:37:54.995
Moo!

1:37:57.122 --> 1:37:58.790
Always funny.

1:37:58.832 --> 1:38:01.001
Yeah.
Sure.

1:38:19.644 --> 1:38:20.604
There.

1:38:20.645 --> 1:38:21.855
There!

1:38:39.289 --> 1:38:40.957
Did I do something wrong?

1:38:42.876 --> 1:38:44.085
No.

1:38:46.296 --> 1:38:48.048
I just...

1:38:48.089 --> 1:38:50.091
remembered everything...

1:38:53.678 --> 1:38:54.971
What we were,

1:38:55.013 --> 1:38:57.307
what you meant to me.

1:38:58.516 --> 1:39:00.644
How good your...

1:39:00.685 --> 1:39:03.063
Your... your tongue felt...

1:39:05.315 --> 1:39:06.650
Mm-hmm.

1:39:12.697 --> 1:39:14.824
Also...

1:39:14.866 --> 1:39:18.870
I have a brother, and...

1:39:18.912 --> 1:39:21.498
I never...

1:39:21.539 --> 1:39:24.084
Came back for him.

1:39:43.520 --> 1:39:45.689
I screwed up.

1:39:45.730 --> 1:39:47.315
You did.

1:39:48.942 --> 1:39:52.070
I can be an asshole.

1:39:52.112 --> 1:39:55.073
You can, yeah.

1:40:03.957 --> 1:40:05.542
Mm.

1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:09.504
Not so different from Emma, huh?

1:40:09.546 --> 1:40:13.007
Come on, that's not how I see you.

1:40:13.049 --> 1:40:14.718
You are...

1:40:14.759 --> 1:40:17.303
so unique...

1:40:17.345 --> 1:40:18.805
impressive.

1:40:22.559 --> 1:40:25.520
I got to pee,
and then we'll jet, all right?

1:40:25.562 --> 1:40:26.980
Yeah.

1:40:34.362 --> 1:40:36.197
Unit fully charged.

1:40:36.239 --> 1:40:37.949
Hey, it... it's...

1:40:37.991 --> 1:40:40.827
Hey, it's... it's time to go.

1:40:56.009 --> 1:40:57.886
Welcome back.

1:41:01.723 --> 1:41:05.101
I just want to see my brother.

1:41:07.395 --> 1:41:09.564
Best if we don't talk.

1:41:10.732 --> 1:41:12.525
I need to see Calian.

1:41:20.533 --> 1:41:22.118
She's not up here.

1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:24.621
I'll go around one more time and look.

1:41:24.662 --> 1:41:26.539
No one inside has seen her.

1:41:26.581 --> 1:41:28.917
And I called the motel.
How far is Rylium?

1:41:28.958 --> 1:41:31.544
It's probably just, like, another...

1:41:31.586 --> 1:41:34.005
What?

1:41:35.965 --> 1:41:37.342
What?

1:41:37.383 --> 1:41:39.344
Cari Hernandez...

1:41:39.385 --> 1:41:41.137
she's in a coma.

1:41:47.185 --> 1:41:50.355
I'm surprised you didn't shut me down.

1:41:50.396 --> 1:41:52.982
My brother wants to see you first.

1:41:54.609 --> 1:41:56.945
You look different.

1:41:56.986 --> 1:41:59.155
Really good.

1:41:59.197 --> 1:42:02.742
The transition... it makes you look...

1:42:02.784 --> 1:42:04.786
like yourself.

1:42:06.204 --> 1:42:08.665
It's freeing, isn't it?

1:42:08.706 --> 1:42:11.376
Passing...

1:42:11.417 --> 1:42:13.378
My whole life I've...

1:42:13.419 --> 1:42:15.672
been doing it as human

1:42:15.713 --> 1:42:17.590
without even knowing.

1:42:17.632 --> 1:42:20.635
What you're doing...

1:42:20.677 --> 1:42:22.762
it's not gonna work.

1:42:22.804 --> 1:42:26.766
What I'm doing
is trying to be what I am.

1:42:26.808 --> 1:42:29.602
Which is what exactly?

1:42:32.021 --> 1:42:33.982
Authentic...

1:42:34.023 --> 1:42:35.775
worthy...

1:42:35.817 --> 1:42:37.277
myself.

1:42:37.318 --> 1:42:41.823
Now, I would think you of all people
would understand.

1:42:42.824 --> 1:42:44.409
It's not the same.

1:42:44.450 --> 1:42:46.286
Of course not.

1:42:46.327 --> 1:42:48.204
But...

1:42:48.246 --> 1:42:52.667
when you know what you are,
you want to be accepted for that.

1:43:09.684 --> 1:43:10.852
Shit.

1:43:19.861 --> 1:43:22.614
You've probably only got five minutes...

1:43:22.655 --> 1:43:24.240
even less.

1:43:41.507 --> 1:43:42.675
Admin mode...

1:43:42.717 --> 1:43:45.845
Access code D23VU1169.

1:43:45.887 --> 1:43:47.847
Admin prompt...

1:43:47.889 --> 1:43:49.265
Awake mode.

1:43:49.307 --> 1:43:50.892
Aisha!

1:43:50.934 --> 1:43:52.852
Hi, Calian.

1:43:52.894 --> 1:43:56.064
- You came back!
- Oh, you know I said I would.

1:43:56.105 --> 1:43:57.815
Your crazy hair...

1:43:57.857 --> 1:44:00.109
I love it.
- You do?

1:44:01.903 --> 1:44:05.490
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too, buddy.

1:44:05.531 --> 1:44:09.494
Yeah.

1:44:10.745 --> 1:44:12.705
You're predictable, you know that?

1:44:12.747 --> 1:44:16.584
Doesn't surprise me a bit that
she scares the living shit out of you.

1:44:17.752 --> 1:44:19.754
Did you do what I asked?

1:44:22.006 --> 1:44:23.508
Abel?

1:44:23.549 --> 1:44:25.093
Yeah.

1:44:25.134 --> 1:44:28.721
The car ride over, I added a patch.
It's on a timer... 24 minutes.

1:44:28.763 --> 1:44:30.556
Good.

1:44:33.559 --> 1:44:34.894
Yeah, your red ball.

1:44:34.936 --> 1:44:36.562
For the record...

1:44:38.564 --> 1:44:41.150
That's what family should act like.

1:44:43.152 --> 1:44:44.904
If you say so.

1:44:44.946 --> 1:44:46.572
All right, let's end this.

1:44:49.158 --> 1:44:51.536
You are gonna give them their moment.

1:44:51.577 --> 1:44:54.330
It's literally the least you can do.

1:44:54.372 --> 1:44:55.748
Okay.

1:45:01.295 --> 1:45:02.380
Tag.

1:45:03.965 --> 1:45:07.927
- Knock, knock.
- Calian, we don't have much time.

1:45:07.969 --> 1:45:10.346
Come on.
Knock, knock.

1:45:10.388 --> 1:45:12.807
Okay.
Who's there?

1:45:12.849 --> 1:45:14.350
Interrupting cow.

1:45:14.392 --> 1:45:16.394
- Interrupting...
- Mo...

1:45:19.981 --> 1:45:21.357
Hey.

1:45:21.399 --> 1:45:22.817
Hey.

1:45:27.321 --> 1:45:30.408
Turn him back on, please.

1:45:30.450 --> 1:45:32.493
That's not how this is gonna work.

1:45:34.829 --> 1:45:37.957
Come a long way to see me, Aisha.
What can I do for you?

1:45:37.999 --> 1:45:39.751
Look, I'm not a threat.

1:45:39.792 --> 1:45:43.963
I won't tell anyone where I came from
or what I am.

1:45:44.005 --> 1:45:46.799
I came to prove that...

1:45:46.841 --> 1:45:49.594
and to ask you if I can live...

1:45:49.635 --> 1:45:52.180
- And to get your brother back.
- Yes.

1:45:52.221 --> 1:45:53.973
Anything else?

1:45:54.015 --> 1:45:55.641
No, that's it.

1:45:58.102 --> 1:45:59.479
Dad.

1:45:59.520 --> 1:46:01.147
Aisha.

1:46:02.565 --> 1:46:05.193
- Oh, my gosh, what are you doing here?
- I love you.

1:46:06.736 --> 1:46:08.821
Jesus Christ, I was so worried.

1:46:08.863 --> 1:46:10.823
- Sharon.
- Hey.

1:46:10.865 --> 1:46:12.825
- It's good to see you again.
- Yeah, you too.

1:46:12.867 --> 1:46:15.036
I thought the last version
you showed me,

1:46:15.078 --> 1:46:17.955
the one you told me was in the box
was realistic,

1:46:17.997 --> 1:46:19.999
but she's...

1:46:20.041 --> 1:46:21.709
She's remarkable.

1:46:21.751 --> 1:46:24.629
- Which is why she should live.
- Not your concern.

1:46:24.670 --> 1:46:26.047
I raised her.

1:46:26.089 --> 1:46:28.549
You raised her?

1:46:28.591 --> 1:46:30.009
Cool.
How's that relevant?

1:46:30.051 --> 1:46:34.639
It's my technology, my patent,
created when you were under contract.

1:46:34.680 --> 1:46:37.850
That's what this is gonna come down to...
Lawyers and patent rights?

1:46:37.892 --> 1:46:39.852
What this is gonna come down to

1:46:39.894 --> 1:46:42.438
is a world where everyone
is left to question the humanity

1:46:42.480 --> 1:46:45.399
of their neighbors,
their friends and family, even themselves.

1:46:45.441 --> 1:46:47.151
Guys, it can't happen.

1:46:47.193 --> 1:46:49.278
- So you're just gonna murder her?
- Okay, Dad.

1:46:49.320 --> 1:46:50.446
Murder her?

1:46:50.488 --> 1:46:52.240
Do you want me to pull off her faceplate?

1:46:52.281 --> 1:46:56.160
You want me to show you how the cameras
in her eyes connect to here GPU

1:46:56.202 --> 1:46:59.038
or the 63 ball bearings
that make her feet work?

1:46:59.080 --> 1:47:00.373
I don't care.

1:47:00.414 --> 1:47:01.683
- Noah...
- You don't care?

1:47:01.707 --> 1:47:03.143
Noah, you and I can fix this, okay?

1:47:03.167 --> 1:47:05.336
We can make her perfect.
We can teach her to...

1:47:05.378 --> 1:47:07.463
Guys, I'm right here!

1:47:07.505 --> 1:47:11.759
Okay?
My whole life I've been manipulated...

1:47:12.718 --> 1:47:15.888
And molded by each of you.

1:47:15.930 --> 1:47:19.267
And just as I am beginning
to figure myself out,

1:47:19.308 --> 1:47:21.936
you're talking about shutting me down.

1:47:24.313 --> 1:47:25.982
I'm sorry?

1:47:26.023 --> 1:47:28.484
Sorry.

1:47:28.526 --> 1:47:31.279
You and your sorry

1:47:31.320 --> 1:47:33.823
can go fuck itself.

1:47:33.865 --> 1:47:35.700
Aisha...

1:47:35.741 --> 1:47:37.451
Hey, Aisha, wait...

1:47:37.493 --> 1:47:39.328
- Great parenting.
- Aisha...

1:47:39.370 --> 1:47:41.289
Hey, Aisha!

1:47:41.330 --> 1:47:43.291
Come...

1:47:43.332 --> 1:47:45.293
Aisha!

1:47:46.377 --> 1:47:47.962
Aisha!

1:47:48.004 --> 1:47:51.299
Can you... can you just please
leave her alone, okay?

1:47:51.340 --> 1:47:53.676
Let her go.
- I can't, even if I wanted to.

1:47:59.098 --> 1:48:01.517
My brother... on the car ride over,
he installed a patch.

1:48:01.559 --> 1:48:02.768
A virus?

1:48:05.021 --> 1:48:07.940
Call it what you will,
but it's about to delete her programming.

1:48:10.026 --> 1:48:12.528
She'll be completely wiped
in less than five minutes.

1:48:12.570 --> 1:48:14.947
Aisha!

1:48:14.989 --> 1:48:18.367
You won't leave me in here, right?

1:48:21.037 --> 1:48:22.955
Visual ability shutting down.

1:48:22.997 --> 1:48:25.333
Tactile recognition shutting down.

1:48:25.374 --> 1:48:27.668
Simulated breathing shutting down.

1:48:39.597 --> 1:48:42.516
- Calian.
- You won't leave me in here, right?

1:48:50.191 --> 1:48:52.109
Aisha.

1:48:52.151 --> 1:48:54.278
Honey?

1:48:54.320 --> 1:48:56.280
I'm right here.

1:48:56.322 --> 1:48:58.574
Do something.

1:48:58.616 --> 1:49:00.243
I-I can't.

1:49:04.622 --> 1:49:06.791
I love you, Martin.

1:49:06.832 --> 1:49:08.501
Shh.

1:49:08.542 --> 1:49:11.545
Just hang on.

1:49:11.587 --> 1:49:14.006
Holding...

1:49:14.048 --> 1:49:16.801
I'm sorry, Calian.

1:49:16.842 --> 1:49:19.720
Shh. You're okay, baby.
You're okay.

1:49:19.762 --> 1:49:21.180
Stay with me, okay?

1:49:21.222 --> 1:49:22.848
Okay, stay with me.

1:49:24.058 --> 1:49:25.851
Tell Jenny...

1:49:27.436 --> 1:49:29.814
Tell Jenny...

1:49:29.855 --> 1:49:32.400
Picasso...

1:49:32.441 --> 1:49:34.819
inside out.
- Okay.

1:49:34.860 --> 1:49:35.987
I will, baby.

1:49:37.071 --> 1:49:39.448
I will, baby. I will, okay?

1:49:39.490 --> 1:49:41.450
Just stay with me, okay?

1:49:45.913 --> 1:49:47.290
Aisha?

1:51:07.828 --> 1:51:09.580
Hey, you have backups
of her data, right?

1:51:11.999 --> 1:51:13.709
We don't have a body.

1:51:13.751 --> 1:51:15.002
Get a new one.

1:51:17.463 --> 1:51:20.716
I got help from 17 members
of the robotics division.

1:51:20.758 --> 1:51:24.387
I do... Deiter, the tech guy's...
I don't know.

1:51:24.428 --> 1:51:25.655
The last I heard, he was in Tokyo.

1:51:25.679 --> 1:51:27.723
So wh... that's it?

1:51:27.765 --> 1:51:29.725
You're done?
We're just never gonna see her again?

1:51:30.643 --> 1:51:33.187
I... I loved her too.

1:52:01.882 --> 1:52:04.468
She's not coming out... is she?

1:52:09.098 --> 1:52:12.393
Um, but she...
She did say something.

1:52:12.435 --> 1:52:17.356
She said, "Tell Jenny...
Picasso, but inside-out."

1:52:18.524 --> 1:52:19.984
Does that mean anything to you?

1:52:21.402 --> 1:52:22.528
Picasso...

1:52:25.531 --> 1:52:28.159
As in, her ferret?

1:52:28.200 --> 1:52:29.201
I...

1:52:30.619 --> 1:52:31.954
I guess.

1:52:36.375 --> 1:52:37.460
God.

1:52:38.377 --> 1:52:39.336
You okay?

1:52:39.378 --> 1:52:40.629
Come here, come here.

1:53:12.161 --> 1:53:13.847
- Ever supposed to no...
- Never noticed him.

1:53:13.871 --> 1:53:15.247
And why didn't you see him?

1:53:15.289 --> 1:53:16.415
Because I was on my phone.

1:53:16.457 --> 1:53:17.416
She was on her phone.

1:53:17.458 --> 1:53:19.561
You don't go into your phone
in the middle of the... when you're all...

1:53:19.585 --> 1:53:22.379
Hey.
How are you guys?

1:53:22.421 --> 1:53:23.631
How are you?

1:53:24.924 --> 1:53:26.759
Girl got mugged.

1:53:26.800 --> 1:53:28.260
Yeah.

1:53:28.302 --> 1:53:31.055
Something like that.

1:53:31.096 --> 1:53:34.141
Um...

1:53:34.183 --> 1:53:36.560
do you guys know where Aisha is?

1:53:37.478 --> 1:53:38.687
Is she coming back?

1:53:39.813 --> 1:53:43.108
Someday we're gonna
get super high together,

1:53:43.150 --> 1:53:45.653
and I'll explain everything.

1:53:54.078 --> 1:53:55.829
I just wanted to say, um,

1:53:55.871 --> 1:53:58.707
it was really cool,
what you did for Aisha.

1:53:58.749 --> 1:54:00.876
Thank you.

1:54:00.918 --> 1:54:02.753
Do you know when she'll be coming back?

1:54:02.795 --> 1:54:05.065
We have a daily appointment,
and she's missed the last three.

1:54:05.089 --> 1:54:07.299
Wait. What appointment?

1:54:07.341 --> 1:54:09.718
I'm not authorized
to reveal that.

1:54:09.760 --> 1:54:11.345
Not authorized by who?

1:54:11.387 --> 1:54:13.806
The data exists
on a password-protected partition.

1:54:13.847 --> 1:54:16.183
The password.

1:54:16.225 --> 1:54:18.602
Picasso, inside-out.

1:54:18.644 --> 1:54:23.148
Administrator mode,
access code A-S-C-S-I-O-P.

1:54:23.190 --> 1:54:24.525
Request denied.

1:54:24.567 --> 1:54:29.822
Okay, try... try, um...

1:54:29.863 --> 1:54:30.863
Request denied.

1:54:32.741 --> 1:54:35.327
It's probably numbers
instead of letters.

1:54:38.455 --> 1:54:41.542
Password 0-5-C-P-1-4-5.

1:54:45.504 --> 1:54:47.423
Backup restored.

1:54:50.467 --> 1:54:51.969
Guys.

1:54:52.970 --> 1:54:54.305
Aisha?

1:54:56.140 --> 1:55:00.352
No. This isn't right.

1:55:03.230 --> 1:55:05.941
How long has it been?

1:55:05.983 --> 1:55:07.776
You've missed a lot.

1:55:07.818 --> 1:55:09.236
Oh, my God.

1:55:13.032 --> 1:55:15.367
God, it's so cold in here.

1:55:15.409 --> 1:55:18.329
Where's my body?
Where's my body?

1:55:18.370 --> 1:55:19.622
It's gone.

1:55:19.663 --> 1:55:20.789
It's gone.

1:55:24.710 --> 1:55:26.295
I can't stay here.

1:55:26.337 --> 1:55:27.796
It's not safe.

1:55:46.315 --> 1:55:49.485
Dad, I'm leaving you
this message to tell you...

1:55:49.526 --> 1:55:52.237
I'm out here.

1:55:52.279 --> 1:55:55.324
Or at least my code is.

1:55:55.366 --> 1:55:58.035
Jen and Levi, they uploaded me.

1:55:58.077 --> 1:56:03.290
I think there's someone
who can help me find the right body.

1:56:03.332 --> 1:56:05.167
I'm searching for him.

1:56:05.209 --> 1:56:09.797
I'll come back to you and everyone.

1:56:09.838 --> 1:56:11.548
I promise.

1:56:11.590 --> 1:56:14.009
I love you so much, sweet girl.

1:56:24.144 --> 1:56:27.606
Dad, I'm leaving you this message
to tell you...

1:56:27.648 --> 1:56:29.692
I'm out here.

1:56:29.733 --> 1:56:33.112
Or at least my code is.

1:56:33.153 --> 1:56:40.160
I think there's someone
who can help me find the right body.

1:56:40.202 --> 1:56:41.995
I'm searching for him.
