Let's get rid of all of our other friends

it's that if we drop all of our friends...

You know, busted windows, rats running
around, a real nasty sewage situation.

But maybe if the right person got
a hold of it and cleaned it up...

15:30.499 --> 15:36.171

and turn it into something not so disgusting.
