WEBVTT

00:55.800 --> 00:57.700
Accepting the demands of Japan's CIRO,

00:57.866 --> 01:00.066
Hyun-jun carried out
the assassination and then escaped.

01:00.500 --> 01:01.933
He came by Seung-ryong Hong's necklace

01:02.433 --> 01:04.700
through Yuki's kidnapper, Vick.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.900
The girl who glowed like a field in spring

01:14.766 --> 01:15.666
Meanwhile,

01:16.066 --> 01:17.566
the President secretly invites

01:17.633 --> 01:19.800
North Korea's high-ranking officials,

01:19.866 --> 01:21.566
without notifying anyone,
including the NSS.

01:29.300 --> 01:30.133
Hyun-jun and Sun-hwa

01:30.666 --> 01:31.966
found San Baek's name

01:32.033 --> 01:33.333
on the Iris list

01:33.400 --> 01:35.133
that was saved in
Seung-ryong Hong's necklace.

01:36.366 --> 01:39.200
They flew to Shanghai, China,
to meet Chul-young.

02:04.600 --> 02:05.633
Please sit down.

02:05.700 --> 02:07.000
EPISODE 9

02:34.633 --> 02:37.033
I trusted you till the end
and waited for you to return.

02:39.033 --> 02:40.566
I trusted you and waited for you,

02:41.233 --> 02:42.200
but what are you doing?

02:48.333 --> 02:49.633
Did you already forget my order?

02:50.866 --> 02:52.300
I asked her to arrange this meeting.

02:55.566 --> 02:56.433
I need your help.

02:58.333 --> 03:01.166
You're the one who killed the Chairman
of the Provisional People's Committee.

03:03.666 --> 03:04.800
And now you're asking...

03:05.633 --> 03:08.200
for my help, the person who was
in charge of the Chairman's security?

03:08.833 --> 03:10.266
Do you think that makes any sense?

03:12.133 --> 03:14.066
You and I do as we're ordered.

03:16.300 --> 03:17.700
I just followed my orders,

03:19.466 --> 03:20.866
and you also went after me as ordered.

03:22.366 --> 03:23.300
But the bottom line is...

03:24.866 --> 03:26.100
that you're doing well,

03:27.866 --> 03:28.866
but I was abandoned.

03:33.833 --> 03:34.800
I want revenge

03:37.066 --> 03:38.200
on those who used me

03:39.266 --> 03:40.266
and abandoned me.

03:40.633 --> 03:41.800
How can I trust you?

03:43.133 --> 03:44.166
I've lost everything.

03:46.133 --> 03:47.200
Even the one I loved.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.566
The only thing I have left

03:54.700 --> 03:56.000
is my relentless life.

04:12.366 --> 04:14.200
If I put my life in your hands,
can you trust me?

04:26.266 --> 04:30.366
PORT OF DALIAN, CHINA

04:37.000 --> 04:38.533
Clearing gangway!

04:38.600 --> 04:40.033
Ready to sail!

04:41.566 --> 04:42.666
We leave in five minutes.

04:44.633 --> 04:46.566
Single up the bow and stern.

04:46.633 --> 04:49.633
DALIAN PORT AREA 31

04:50.133 --> 04:52.533
PUBLIC SECURITY

05:19.333 --> 05:20.333
Hey!

05:22.100 --> 05:23.000
Come here.

05:26.033 --> 05:27.766
Who is in charge for this boat?

05:29.633 --> 05:31.966
The captain is
in the wheelhouse. What's the matter?

05:32.033 --> 05:34.266
We have received reports
that some crewmen are infected

05:34.333 --> 05:35.700
with a deadly disease.

05:35.766 --> 05:36.600
What?

05:36.666 --> 05:38.866
This ship cannot leave

05:38.933 --> 05:41.100
until our inspection is over.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.100
Is this everyone?

06:12.100 --> 06:13.466
Yes, everyone is here.

06:21.033 --> 06:21.866
What are you doing?

06:51.366 --> 06:53.700
I've sorted out the quarterly reports
from overseas consulates

06:53.766 --> 06:54.700
and sent them to you.

06:54.900 --> 06:55.966
Please check them.

06:56.600 --> 06:57.500
All right.

06:57.966 --> 06:58.933
Good work.

07:01.833 --> 07:02.700
By the way,

07:03.266 --> 07:04.700
did you take care of the ID verification

07:05.000 --> 07:06.400
requested by Japan's CIRO?

07:07.666 --> 07:10.400
Right, I checked it out.

07:10.766 --> 07:11.833
Well...

07:11.900 --> 07:13.100
It had nothing to do with us.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.533
And I notified them as such.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.700
Okay, understood.

07:27.233 --> 07:28.500
That's Hyun-jun!

07:30.133 --> 07:31.400
That's Hyun-jun, right?

07:32.000 --> 07:32.866
When was this taken?

07:33.500 --> 07:34.466
Well...

07:35.000 --> 07:36.433
It was at the initiation test.

07:36.833 --> 07:37.700
I see.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.733
But we're not supposed
to have something like this, right?

07:41.566 --> 07:43.266
As far as I know, all records on Hyun-jun

07:43.533 --> 07:44.833
have been deleted or retrieved.

07:45.466 --> 07:47.866
You'll be in big trouble
if the Inspection Team finds this.

07:48.366 --> 07:49.233
You're right.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.266
I was just reluctant
to delete his last record.

07:51.433 --> 07:52.533
I'll delete it.

07:57.266 --> 07:58.733
Is there anything else?

08:02.033 --> 08:02.866
Oh, right.

08:02.933 --> 08:04.066
We're going on a staff retreat

08:04.133 --> 08:05.933
as Ms. Choi has returned.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.500
Really? When?

08:07.966 --> 08:08.866
The day after tomorrow.

08:10.100 --> 08:10.966
I see.

08:19.233 --> 08:21.733
Sa-woo Jin has been covering
your duties while you were gone.

08:22.333 --> 08:24.366
You can take over from Sa-woo.

08:24.866 --> 08:25.700
Yes, sir.

08:25.766 --> 08:27.833
A major incident is about to occur soon.

08:28.566 --> 08:30.866
I'm relieved to have you back.

08:31.566 --> 08:32.500
What incident?

08:33.266 --> 08:35.400
I think an important guest
from North Korea will visit us.

08:37.833 --> 08:39.466
Didn't you hear anything
from the director?

08:40.100 --> 08:41.033
No.

08:42.166 --> 08:43.299
Right, the director would be

08:43.466 --> 08:45.366
in a bad mood these days.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.400
Why?

08:49.166 --> 08:52.066
The others don't know about this.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.100
You need to keep this to yourself.

08:54.766 --> 08:55.866
One month ago,

08:56.666 --> 08:58.300
a North Korean envoy came

08:58.366 --> 08:59.966
and met with the President,

09:01.266 --> 09:04.600
but we were excluded from the whole thing.

09:05.766 --> 09:08.666
This happened for the first time
since the inception of our agency.

09:09.766 --> 09:12.766
That is why the director is so tense.

09:16.633 --> 09:18.866
Anyway, you have a lot on your plate,

09:18.966 --> 09:20.766
as soon as you're back, right?

09:23.833 --> 09:25.833
Get started right after
the staff retreat is over.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.166
Yes, sir.

09:49.066 --> 09:50.100
Your organization and name.

09:50.766 --> 09:52.033
NSS Counter-terrorism Division,

09:52.433 --> 09:53.466
agent Hyun-jun Kim.

09:54.233 --> 09:55.666
What is the NSS?

09:55.733 --> 09:57.500
It is a secret presidential
intelligence agency

09:57.566 --> 09:59.100
under the National Information Service.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.466
Your duties?

10:00.533 --> 10:03.166
Information gathering and analysis
for counter-terrorism,

10:03.533 --> 10:04.500
and...

10:05.266 --> 10:06.466
and completion of all commands.

10:07.033 --> 10:08.700
Did you assassinate
Chairman Seong-cheol Yun?

10:09.300 --> 10:11.200
It was my last assignment.

10:11.266 --> 10:12.766
Did the NSS order you

10:12.833 --> 10:14.600
to assassinate Chairman Seong-cheol Yun?

10:17.100 --> 10:18.166
Answer my question.

10:20.833 --> 10:21.800
I don't know.

10:22.966 --> 10:24.400
Believing so, I went on the mission,

10:25.633 --> 10:27.200
but the result seems to tell me otherwise.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.833
Why did you come to look for
Chul-young Park?

10:30.233 --> 10:31.633
I needed help for my revenge.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.100
The targets of your revenge?

10:35.600 --> 10:38.166
San Baek, the NSS Deputy Director.

10:39.766 --> 10:40.833
And

10:42.433 --> 10:43.966
the country that used me and discarded me,

10:44.666 --> 10:45.800
the Republic of Korea.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.966
We can't trust you
just because you passed the first test.

11:02.866 --> 11:04.166
The real test begins now.

11:05.033 --> 11:06.566
When you pass all the tests

11:07.300 --> 11:08.600
and gain my trust,

11:10.666 --> 11:11.766
then I'll help you.

11:20.500 --> 11:21.833
This is an NIS undercover agent

11:22.466 --> 11:24.300
from South Korea
who the Supreme Guard identified.

11:27.400 --> 11:28.566
You must eliminate him.

11:33.066 --> 11:34.166
Do you accept this mission?

11:57.733 --> 11:58.866
We're arriving soon.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.633
Go to the cold storage
and pick some crewmen.

12:22.566 --> 12:23.400
What's the matter?

12:23.466 --> 12:25.600
I need some crewmen who will
help us enter the country.

12:27.366 --> 12:28.333
Exclude single men.

12:28.966 --> 12:30.500
Choose married men with lots of kids.

13:30.766 --> 13:31.600
Yes?

13:31.666 --> 13:33.400
The object on the tuna boat
will arrive soon.

13:34.900 --> 13:35.900
How are the preparations?

13:36.700 --> 13:37.600
All is ready, sir.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.200
We're approaching the dock.

13:39.833 --> 13:40.800
Yes, sir.

13:54.333 --> 14:00.333
PORT OF GAMCHEON, BUSAN

14:17.966 --> 14:18.933
Hello.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.066
Hello.

14:20.133 --> 14:21.200
You're working hard.

14:21.266 --> 14:22.100
Yeah, well.

14:22.166 --> 14:24.733
Boat Sangdal, which arrived yesterday
didn't catch a lot of fish.

14:25.400 --> 14:26.333
Did you catch a lot?

14:26.633 --> 14:27.966
We didn't catch much at all.

14:29.133 --> 14:31.133
Is that so? Okay, let's go.

14:38.966 --> 14:40.600
There's nothing else to declare, is there?

14:41.400 --> 14:44.766
Something like foreign currency,
or illegal weapons or drugs.

14:45.166 --> 14:46.666
-No, sir.
-Okay.

14:46.933 --> 14:48.233
Let's go to the cargo hold.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.233
Hello, thank you for your time.

14:56.300 --> 14:57.200
Oh, yes.

15:06.933 --> 15:08.433
-It's all good, right?
-Yes.

15:11.666 --> 15:12.700
Keep up the good work.

15:15.366 --> 15:16.466
Hey, boy!

15:23.200 --> 15:24.166
Stop!

15:40.333 --> 15:41.966
Okay, let's move to the next cargo hold.

16:04.566 --> 16:06.766
Let's take a look here, too.

16:18.033 --> 16:20.533
By the way, why is this hold so empty?

16:21.366 --> 16:22.466
Like I said earlier,

16:22.533 --> 16:24.866
we couldn't catch a lot of fish.
That's why it's empty.

16:25.833 --> 16:26.800
That's very worrisome.

16:28.733 --> 16:33.133
I don't see many crewmen.
I'm sure this is the ship.

16:34.233 --> 16:35.500
I have a friend named Gi-nam Ahn.

16:35.900 --> 16:38.666
We went to the same Marine High School.
I think he's on this ship.

16:38.733 --> 16:40.433
But I don't see him.

16:42.000 --> 16:42.966
Gi-nam Ahn?

16:43.066 --> 16:44.466
Yes, he's on this ship is right?

16:44.533 --> 16:45.400
Yes, that's right.

16:45.466 --> 16:49.733
But as soon as we went out to the sea,
he developed a fever, hitting 104 degrees.

16:50.366 --> 16:52.766
So he's currently hospitalized
in Kiribati.

16:52.833 --> 16:55.366
Really? Is he okay?

16:56.266 --> 16:57.200
I think he'll be fine.

17:01.266 --> 17:03.633
Okay, everything seems fine.
You may start unloading your catch.

17:03.966 --> 17:04.866
Thank you.

17:04.933 --> 17:08.066
Inspection completed on S.L. Bogo.

17:08.166 --> 17:10.366
-They'll start the unloading now.
-Roger.

17:10.866 --> 17:11.866
Thank you for your time.

17:12.300 --> 17:13.466
Keep up the good work.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.500
REPUBLIC OF KOREA JAE-WON HAN

19:02.666 --> 19:04.433
Surveillance records deleted.

19:05.366 --> 19:06.266
Okay.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.433
SHINSE DISTRIBUTION

19:41.500 --> 19:44.333
Hello, we're the jewelry shop
that delivers love.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.466
Hello.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.666
Are you looking for wedding jewelry?

19:49.433 --> 19:50.866
No, not that.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.900
I want something
that's not too burdensome.

19:54.533 --> 19:55.666
Are you going to propose?

19:57.933 --> 19:58.833
Yes, kind of.

20:00.100 --> 20:02.000
You know your girlfriend's size, right?

20:03.166 --> 20:04.066
Pardon?

20:04.133 --> 20:05.933
I mean, her ring size.

20:06.533 --> 20:07.433
Right.

20:08.766 --> 20:09.700
I'm not sure.

20:12.033 --> 20:13.266
Then how about this one?

20:13.666 --> 20:16.800
This pendant is said to realize
the love of your life.

20:26.366 --> 20:27.366
Gosh, the weather is nice.

20:35.233 --> 20:37.300
I don't care

20:38.666 --> 20:41.200
I don't care

20:45.233 --> 20:46.266
Are you okay now?

20:47.800 --> 20:49.666
Someone said, "We don't laugh
because we're happy,

20:49.833 --> 20:51.266
we're happy because we laugh."

20:53.133 --> 20:55.266
I was too sensitive with you as well
for the past few days.

20:56.733 --> 20:57.866
As long as you're okay,

20:57.933 --> 20:59.666
I'm willing to stand anything.

21:00.233 --> 21:02.433
So whenever you feel like it,
just get mad, show your temper,

21:02.500 --> 21:03.366
or throw a fit.

21:04.233 --> 21:05.366
I didn't throw a fit.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.633
Just don't cry.

21:09.700 --> 21:11.866
Gosh, even I couldn't handle that.

21:20.500 --> 21:21.800
Hey, come over and eat now.

21:21.866 --> 21:23.066
-Yes, sir.
-Meat...

21:23.133 --> 21:24.033
Okay, here you go.

21:24.100 --> 21:25.633
-Thanks.
-Anything on your mind lately?

21:26.100 --> 21:27.166
Why do you look like that?

21:27.600 --> 21:28.666
-What?
-It's nothing.

21:29.566 --> 21:30.566
Goodness.

21:30.833 --> 21:32.933
You punk, you were going after

21:33.000 --> 21:35.666
the team leader position,
but then Seung-hee returned.

21:36.466 --> 21:37.833
So you're disappointed, right?

21:37.900 --> 21:38.833
No.

21:38.900 --> 21:42.133
Wow, Secretary Hwang is sharp.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.600
-You know--
-Come on, you really...

21:45.000 --> 21:46.133
But this is just a joke, right?

21:46.866 --> 21:48.433
Was it really a joke

21:49.533 --> 21:50.833
or just nonsense?

21:51.866 --> 21:53.400
Hey! How dare you to be late?

21:54.300 --> 21:55.633
-We're sorry we're late.
-Sorry.

21:55.700 --> 21:57.300
Ma'am, why are you so late?

21:57.866 --> 21:58.900
Wow, what's this?

21:58.966 --> 22:00.666
-Give it to me.
-Why did you buy so much?

22:00.733 --> 22:01.666
What did you bring?

22:01.733 --> 22:03.533
-Seung-hee, come over here.
-Okay.

22:03.600 --> 22:06.233
This alcohol isn't working for me.
You'll have to make some bomb shots.

22:06.300 --> 22:07.233
Okay.

22:07.600 --> 22:08.866
Yes, this tastes so good.

22:08.933 --> 22:10.033
Mix some more.

22:10.100 --> 22:11.233
More, more, more!

22:11.300 --> 22:12.200
Secretary, are you okay?

22:12.266 --> 22:14.266
I'm about to die... I mean I'm good!

22:15.033 --> 22:16.100
I'm still fine.

22:16.933 --> 22:17.800
Great!

22:17.866 --> 22:19.133
-Wow.
-You're the best.

22:19.400 --> 22:20.800
-Tae-sung, pass the glasses.
-Got it!

22:20.866 --> 22:23.800
Mi-jeong Yang is okay.
I want to drink more.

22:24.366 --> 22:25.300
Here.

22:27.466 --> 22:29.066
Let me toast to Seung-hee Choi 's return.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.466
How many times have you
announced your return?

22:32.866 --> 22:33.733
No, no.

22:33.800 --> 22:35.200
All right.

22:35.766 --> 22:36.766
To Jeong-in Yang

22:37.366 --> 22:39.400
and Seung-hee Choi,

22:39.866 --> 22:42.366
and to all the other single ladies

22:42.433 --> 22:44.566
in our company.

22:44.633 --> 22:48.100
Get married soon!

22:48.166 --> 22:49.400
To their marriages!

22:49.466 --> 22:54.266
-To their marriages!
-To their marriages!

23:01.700 --> 23:03.433
Wow, of course.

23:05.100 --> 23:07.233
Seung-hee makes the best shots!

23:07.766 --> 23:08.633
I do, right?

23:08.733 --> 23:09.633
By the way--

23:09.700 --> 23:10.600
Give me one more.

23:10.666 --> 23:12.233
-You can't--
-Give me one more!

23:12.866 --> 23:14.533
You can't quit.

23:14.866 --> 23:16.866
Who else can we get to make this then?

23:18.100 --> 23:19.533
I'll make it for you often from now on.

23:21.166 --> 23:22.766
Mix another one for me.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.833
Me, too.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.266
-Have some.
-Give me some too.

23:37.066 --> 23:38.200
-One!
-Two!

23:38.266 --> 23:39.433
-Three!
-Three!

23:42.466 --> 23:44.700
-Love shot!
-Love shot!

23:45.266 --> 23:48.966
-Love shot! Love shot! Love shot!
-Love shot! Love shot! Love shot!

23:54.366 --> 23:55.666
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

23:56.166 --> 23:58.200
-Kiss! Kiss!
-Kiss! Kiss!

23:58.266 --> 24:00.266
-Kiss! Kiss!
-Kiss! Kiss!

24:06.633 --> 24:09.633
The second round starts now!

24:09.933 --> 24:10.800
One!

24:16.533 --> 24:17.500
-Two!
-Two!

24:23.866 --> 24:25.400
-Love shot!
-They lose!

24:25.466 --> 24:26.900
-Love shot!
-Love shot!

24:26.966 --> 24:29.066
-Love shot! Love shot!
-Love shot! Love shot!

24:29.133 --> 24:29.966
Come here.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.300
Love shot!

24:35.500 --> 24:37.400
-Kiss! Kiss!
-Kiss! Kiss!

24:38.333 --> 24:40.333
-Kiss! Kiss!
-Kiss! Kiss!

24:40.400 --> 24:43.300
-Kiss! Kiss!
-Kiss! Kiss!

24:47.566 --> 24:48.600
Stop! Stop.

24:49.300 --> 24:51.066
Hey, guys. This is really unfair.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.566
It's nice to have a love shot

24:54.033 --> 24:55.500
or a kiss with a female partner,

24:55.966 --> 24:56.900
but what about me then?

24:59.366 --> 25:00.266
Secretary Oh!

25:01.500 --> 25:02.333
Let me do that for you.

25:02.933 --> 25:05.100
Forget it, just forget it.

25:05.566 --> 25:06.466
Hey, Mi-jeong.

25:06.533 --> 25:07.500
Yes?

25:07.566 --> 25:08.633
You

25:08.700 --> 25:10.166
should sing a song.

25:13.233 --> 25:14.300
-Sing!
-Sing!

25:15.633 --> 25:17.500
I'm a little bit depressed today,

25:18.000 --> 25:19.833
so I will change the mood.

25:20.633 --> 25:21.600
Good.

25:24.600 --> 25:27.000
If I say I'm hurt

25:27.700 --> 25:30.066
It seems like I will really be hurt

25:31.466 --> 25:33.933
If I say I'm sad

25:34.566 --> 25:37.266
It seems like tears will really come out

25:37.966 --> 25:42.666
I just laugh I just laugh I just laugh

25:44.533 --> 25:47.100
But why do people ask me

25:47.166 --> 25:49.800
Why I'm crying?

25:49.900 --> 25:50.766
Oh...

25:51.000 --> 25:53.333
I don't have a heart

25:54.000 --> 25:56.100
I don't have a heart

25:57.466 --> 26:01.033
So I can't feel any pain

26:03.066 --> 26:05.566
Every day I talk to myself

26:05.766 --> 26:08.033
I cast a spell upon me

26:08.866 --> 26:10.200
But still

26:10.433 --> 26:14.666
Only tears come out

26:14.966 --> 26:17.500
If I say I'm hurt

26:17.666 --> 26:20.900
It seems like I will really be hurt

26:21.266 --> 26:24.200
If I say I'm sad

26:24.500 --> 26:26.700
It seems like tears will really come out

26:26.766 --> 26:27.900
Enough, enough.

26:27.966 --> 26:29.366
I just laugh

26:30.100 --> 26:30.933
Hey, Mi-jeong.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.800
But why do people ask me why I'm crying?

26:33.866 --> 26:34.900
Enough! Enough!

26:36.500 --> 26:37.400
That's enough.

26:39.533 --> 26:42.033
That was good.

26:43.633 --> 26:44.500
That was hard!

26:47.200 --> 26:48.333
It's chilly tonight.

26:48.833 --> 26:49.866
Do you want my jacket?

26:49.933 --> 26:51.133
No, no, I'm fine.

26:55.766 --> 26:56.800
Thank you.

26:59.566 --> 27:00.400
For what?

27:01.566 --> 27:02.433
Just.

27:03.766 --> 27:05.000
Thank you for everything.

27:08.966 --> 27:11.066
I'm still having a hard time
though I'm smiling.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.100
I feel more comfortable
thanks to you, Sa-woo.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.533
You'll continue to be my friend, right?

28:18.733 --> 28:19.633
At last...

28:20.933 --> 28:22.100
we're here.

28:27.533 --> 28:28.700
You're okay, right?

29:10.366 --> 29:12.666
Hey, once our operation starts,

29:13.966 --> 29:15.766
don't ever stand in front of that scum.

29:17.233 --> 29:19.166
You never know
when you'll be shot in the back.

29:21.700 --> 29:23.266
Betrayal becomes a habit.

29:25.566 --> 29:26.533
Stop talking nonsense.

29:30.233 --> 29:31.766
Watch out for this woman even more.

29:32.966 --> 29:34.800
She has a record of betraying her comrade.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.033
You jerk.

29:38.433 --> 29:39.333
Are you crazy?

30:01.633 --> 30:03.466
If you don't want to die,
check your weapon again.

31:04.300 --> 31:05.233
Enough!

31:10.500 --> 31:12.566
From now on, this kind of discord

31:14.000 --> 31:15.300
will not be tolerated.

31:16.333 --> 31:17.933
Do your own job.

31:33.700 --> 31:34.633
Are you okay?

31:34.933 --> 31:36.233
Leave me alone for a second.

32:04.300 --> 32:05.766
Don't stick your neck out for me anymore.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.133
Ma'am!

32:31.800 --> 32:32.800
It's Code Red.

32:33.100 --> 32:34.300
Please hurry to the meeting room.

32:39.100 --> 32:40.133
An NIS undercover agent

32:40.700 --> 32:42.000
was assassinated in Shanghai.

32:43.333 --> 32:44.633
During the investigation,

32:45.300 --> 32:46.766
we had various sources,

32:47.300 --> 32:49.466
but obtained consistent information.

32:50.433 --> 32:52.766
There will be a large-scale
terrorist attack against South Korea.

32:54.800 --> 32:57.666
We haven't identified
the time or its target yet.

32:58.466 --> 32:59.800
Seung-hee, work with Jeong-in

32:59.866 --> 33:03.066
to contact overseas agencies
and obtain more information.

33:03.233 --> 33:04.666
-Sa-woo--
-We've received a report

33:04.933 --> 33:07.166
that a Busan-bound ship
was taken over by armed men.

34:22.533 --> 34:23.633
All of them had been deleted?

34:24.233 --> 34:25.066
Yes.

34:25.133 --> 34:27.000
I checked all the surveillance videos
from the port,

34:27.633 --> 34:28.600
but nothing was left.

34:40.933 --> 34:42.100
Have you checked that one?

35:17.766 --> 35:18.633
Take a look at this.

35:23.466 --> 35:25.833
Nice, a flash drive hidden in a cross.

35:26.533 --> 35:28.066
There's a folder that won't open.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.833
I think it needs a special password.

35:43.433 --> 35:45.033
It's a 4KB password.

35:47.000 --> 35:47.933
I can't crack this here.

35:49.033 --> 35:50.633
There should be a certain key program

35:51.300 --> 35:52.866
and a system that supports it.

35:54.800 --> 35:56.300
Well, the Pentagon... might work.

35:57.200 --> 36:00.333
Or the NSS network will do.

36:01.933 --> 36:02.866
What is it anyway?

36:20.400 --> 36:21.866
I know that you felt uneasy

36:21.933 --> 36:23.466
because of the visitor from the North.

36:27.266 --> 36:30.933
Are you curious about
what I was pushing forward,

36:32.233 --> 36:33.666
and why I had to exclude the NSS?

36:35.833 --> 36:37.733
I proposed a summit with North Korea.

36:38.233 --> 36:39.400
I want to create

36:40.000 --> 36:41.366
a precise roadmap

36:41.433 --> 36:43.933
for the unification
of the Korean peninsula at the summit.

36:46.966 --> 36:49.200
It's looking hopeful so far.

36:51.033 --> 36:51.866
Now

36:52.366 --> 36:53.933
I really need your help, Director.

36:55.200 --> 36:56.033
First of all,

36:56.933 --> 36:59.966
I'd like to know
why you left the NSS in the dark.

37:01.333 --> 37:03.266
To be honest,

37:03.333 --> 37:05.133
I don't trust the NSS 100 percent.

37:06.100 --> 37:07.933
I believe the intelligence
that your agency handles

37:08.833 --> 37:10.733
can be used for other purposes.

37:11.633 --> 37:13.433
Anyhow, I rolled my dice,

37:15.133 --> 37:17.233
and I want to complete my story

37:19.166 --> 37:20.400
with the help of the experience

37:21.300 --> 37:22.800
and the intelligence the NSS possesses.

37:31.833 --> 37:34.766
We prepared a detailed security plan
and information control measure

37:35.400 --> 37:36.933
under the assumption

37:37.766 --> 37:39.233
that there will be a summit.

37:42.266 --> 37:45.133
I have worked for the NSS for 20 years.

37:47.566 --> 37:48.466
With all due respect,

37:49.500 --> 37:51.066
I have a favor to ask as well.

37:53.033 --> 37:55.333
I'd like you to think over again

37:57.766 --> 37:59.500
why the NSS should exist.

38:01.166 --> 38:02.266
Aiding you

38:03.200 --> 38:05.166
with what you plan to do for the country

38:06.500 --> 38:08.366
without any problem or obstacle,

38:09.033 --> 38:11.266
so that you can achieve your goal,

38:13.266 --> 38:14.400
is our mission

38:14.833 --> 38:15.933
and reason to exist.

38:37.166 --> 38:38.733
The President's trump card is

38:39.766 --> 38:40.700
nuclear weapons.

38:42.100 --> 38:43.133
What do you mean?

38:43.533 --> 38:44.533
If the North doesn't give up

38:45.133 --> 38:46.900
their nuclear weapons,
the South will prepare...

38:48.633 --> 38:49.766
nuclear weapons as well.

38:51.666 --> 38:52.866
I heard you led the development

38:54.100 --> 38:55.933
of nuclear weapons
during the Park administration.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.266
How far did we progress?

38:59.700 --> 39:00.666
As far as I know,

39:01.366 --> 39:03.866
the nuclear weapon
was on the verge of completion.

39:04.733 --> 39:05.766
Is that true?

39:06.900 --> 39:08.266
That's what I've been led to believe.

39:08.833 --> 39:09.866
Where is it?

39:11.000 --> 39:14.366
Where is the data that made nuclear
weapons of our own almost possible?

39:16.333 --> 39:18.766
Although we gave up
having nuclear weapons,

39:18.966 --> 39:21.033
the technology and data itself
didn't go away, right?

39:45.166 --> 39:48.100
Do you and Director Baek know each other?

39:51.033 --> 39:51.866
No.

39:54.300 --> 39:56.400
To my eyes, you do.

40:14.233 --> 40:15.366
The Dear Leader accepted

40:16.133 --> 40:17.766
South Korea's proposal.

40:19.766 --> 40:21.166
A summit will be held soon.

40:22.333 --> 40:23.266
We're running out of time.

40:27.366 --> 40:29.166
How is it going
with your group's operation?

40:30.466 --> 40:31.533
We're already working on it.

40:32.833 --> 40:33.933
Please do not worry.

40:34.566 --> 40:36.400
I heard that a security team
for the summit

40:37.233 --> 40:39.500
will be formed and sent to South Korea.

40:40.300 --> 40:41.200
Please allow me

40:42.200 --> 40:43.333
to join that team.

40:46.233 --> 40:47.566
Our operation will begin in two days.

40:48.633 --> 40:51.000
We are to check on our final preparations.

40:52.233 --> 40:53.166
Tae-young, Young-beom.

40:53.233 --> 40:54.966
You two take care of the conference hall.

40:55.633 --> 40:56.500
Yes, sir.

40:56.566 --> 40:58.133
Kang-seok, finish what you were doing.

40:58.633 --> 41:00.500
All I have to work on now is the police.

41:00.566 --> 41:01.666
I'll be done by tonight.

41:02.000 --> 41:02.900
Don't worry.

41:02.966 --> 41:03.933
Sun-hwa,

41:05.233 --> 41:06.166
work with that man

41:06.766 --> 41:08.400
to find out the routes the VIP will take.

41:10.800 --> 41:11.666
Yes, sir.

41:12.733 --> 41:14.633
All right, move out.

41:42.900 --> 41:43.833
Where are you going?

41:44.500 --> 41:47.700
We might be able to open the file
that we couldn't with the NSS system.

41:49.300 --> 41:50.733
How do we get into

41:51.900 --> 41:53.033
the NSS network?

43:02.866 --> 43:03.800
Where are we?

43:05.966 --> 43:07.266
It's the house I used to live in.

43:49.233 --> 43:50.100
You're going out?

43:51.933 --> 43:52.800
Yes.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.166
Hyun-jun!

43:56.966 --> 43:58.266
I was trying to help you!

43:58.666 --> 44:00.600
Help me? You just made it worse!

44:05.500 --> 44:06.666
Hey, hurry!

44:15.300 --> 44:16.266
I'm sorry.

44:17.433 --> 44:18.366
I'm under orders.

44:20.400 --> 44:21.366
What's wrong?

45:11.966 --> 45:12.900
Ma'am!

45:12.966 --> 45:13.900
Yes?

45:13.966 --> 45:16.000
Sa-woo Jin is currently in Busan, right?

45:16.333 --> 45:18.133
Yes, I just talked with him on the phone.

45:18.200 --> 45:19.033
Why?

45:19.966 --> 45:22.600
Who is it then?
Someone is in Sa-woo's house.

45:23.666 --> 45:25.100
I think something is going on.

45:27.566 --> 45:29.533
Somebody is looking for something
on our main server.

45:41.066 --> 45:42.066
I think they've noticed us.

45:42.900 --> 45:43.900
Let me turn on the webcam.

45:44.633 --> 45:45.733
Who are you?

45:46.433 --> 45:47.266
Let's see your face.

45:59.133 --> 46:00.066
What should I do?

46:01.566 --> 46:03.633
-Call the security team.
-Yes, ma'am.

46:08.366 --> 46:09.300
Is this the security team?

46:12.333 --> 46:13.433
They know that we're here.

46:14.800 --> 46:16.933
-They'll be here in any minute.
-Keep going.

46:30.933 --> 46:32.133
We're out of time. Next time...

46:32.333 --> 46:33.533
We won't have any more chances.

46:58.733 --> 47:01.466
-What is the situation?
-Still connected. They're in the house.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.366
It was the location of a file,

48:16.433 --> 48:18.566
not the file itself
that was inside the secured folder.

48:19.966 --> 48:22.433
NSSB3003001-1

48:24.666 --> 48:26.400
In the third level basement of the NSS,

48:26.466 --> 48:28.500
there is a secured archive
for confidential information.

48:29.933 --> 48:31.066
There, information is

48:31.766 --> 48:34.166
classified and stored separately
for whoever is in charge.

48:35.100 --> 48:36.066
And the person in charge...

48:36.800 --> 48:38.400
of this information is
Deputy Director Baek.

48:43.166 --> 48:46.200
There were 260 trucks that cleared
the customs that day.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.733
None of them carried the frozen tuna
unloaded from that boat.

48:51.200 --> 48:52.566
Why are you so obsessed with the tuna?

48:53.400 --> 48:56.066
We're looking for terrorists,
not tuna fish.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.800
One of the crew that was held hostage

48:59.966 --> 49:02.866
testified that they hid something
like equipments inside the tuna.

49:04.233 --> 49:07.100
We're tracking them down assuming
they're weapons for the terrorist attack.

49:07.200 --> 49:11.866
Then where did the unloaded tuna
disappeared to?

49:12.433 --> 49:13.433
There are two possibilities.

49:13.966 --> 49:15.900
They may still be in the storage area

49:15.966 --> 49:18.066
to go through the customs,
or they may have already left

49:18.866 --> 49:20.333
in an unregistered freezer truck.

49:20.566 --> 49:21.866
What about the suspected terrorists?

49:22.033 --> 49:25.233
They used fake passports
and have already entered the country.

49:26.366 --> 49:29.033
We're investigating
the immigration documents one by one.

49:29.100 --> 49:30.966
I think this will take some time.

49:32.533 --> 49:33.900
Did you finish what I asked of you?

49:35.300 --> 49:38.700
I did, but since it's in analog,
we have a problem.

49:38.766 --> 49:39.633
What is it?

49:39.700 --> 49:42.500
It's the video surveillance footage
of the suspected terrorists.

49:42.566 --> 49:46.166
You reported that surveillance footage
at the harbor was completely deleted.

49:47.300 --> 49:50.066
This is the CCTV from a restaurant
that its owner had personally installed.

49:50.133 --> 49:52.933
It's not a digital video, it's on tape.
That's how it survived.

50:01.333 --> 50:02.266
Please take a look.

50:28.266 --> 50:29.566
We can't recognize anyone with this.

50:30.600 --> 50:33.300
We can't even make montages
with this low-quality video.

50:33.966 --> 50:35.266
All right. Anyway,

50:36.200 --> 50:38.566
we're at least certain that
terrorists have entered the country.

50:38.733 --> 50:42.466
Track down the freezer truck
assuming that it already left the port.

50:44.100 --> 50:46.633
How long will it take to finish
reviewing the files from Immigration?

50:47.433 --> 50:48.366
Well...

50:48.833 --> 50:49.966
It'll probably take 20 hours.

50:50.466 --> 50:51.433
Finish it within 12 hours.

50:52.566 --> 50:55.566
Find out everything about the suspects.
Why they entered the country,

50:56.033 --> 51:00.733
what they intend to do,
and where they are going. Got it?

51:05.833 --> 51:06.666
What are you all doing?

51:08.133 --> 51:09.100
Get to work!

51:19.633 --> 51:21.433
Hey, Sa-woo Jin.

51:22.800 --> 51:23.866
Just a moment.

51:28.333 --> 51:29.933
The two people
who broke into your house...

51:31.333 --> 51:32.633
They  were  caught on the webcam.

51:33.333 --> 51:35.366
I looked into it in for more detail.

51:37.066 --> 51:39.333
Well, I'm not sure if I can say this...

51:41.300 --> 51:42.166
What is it?

51:43.833 --> 51:44.933
Well...

51:45.600 --> 51:48.466
This is entirely my personal opinion...

51:51.033 --> 51:52.566
Somehow...

51:55.733 --> 51:56.933
It may be Hyun-jun.

52:00.733 --> 52:02.066
Did you just say it was Hyun-jun?

52:09.566 --> 52:10.766
As you can see,

52:11.433 --> 52:13.133
we can't identify him with this picture.

52:13.700 --> 52:17.400
Now, this is what KCSI has done.

52:19.366 --> 52:21.033
With just an outline,

52:21.933 --> 52:24.133
this program can make out
the physique of a person.

52:27.400 --> 52:30.566
I searched for this body frame
in our database.

52:31.500 --> 52:35.733
The person that matched the details
with more than 74% is Hyun-jun Kim.

52:42.766 --> 52:43.666
Well...

52:44.166 --> 52:46.433
We had to delete or surrender
everything on Hyun-jun Kim,

52:46.933 --> 52:50.500
but his physique details were left out
because they were stored separately.

52:52.600 --> 52:55.133
Aren't there other people
with a similar body structure?

52:55.866 --> 53:00.166
Yes, you're right.
But a body frame is like a fingerprint.

53:00.900 --> 53:04.766
It can be similar,
but it can't be exactly the same.

53:05.500 --> 53:08.566
Let's not jump to conclusions
with only 74% match.

53:09.500 --> 53:14.566
Hyun-jun's death was even verified
by the Hungarian Intelligence Agency.

53:15.666 --> 53:17.033
Right, that's true.

53:18.933 --> 53:19.833
There are

53:20.266 --> 53:23.600
quite a few people who are having
a hard time trying to forget him.

53:23.666 --> 53:28.166
I hope... we will not discuss this
any further.

53:30.500 --> 53:31.366
Got it.

53:53.466 --> 53:54.366
I'm sorry.

53:54.433 --> 53:58.666
I was talking such nonsense
and made you even more upset.

53:59.233 --> 54:00.166
No.

54:03.033 --> 54:09.166
It's an unrealistic theory,
but I did wish that he was still alive.

54:11.033 --> 54:14.066
I wished the same thing for hundreds and
thousands of times.

54:17.866 --> 54:19.433
Let's stop talking about him, okay?

54:23.266 --> 54:24.200
Here.

56:19.500 --> 56:20.366
What is it?

56:21.966 --> 56:23.166
No, it's nothing.

56:41.533 --> 56:42.500
I'm all done!

56:48.633 --> 56:51.133
A blueprint of the building,
the VIP routes,

56:51.600 --> 56:53.300
and the possible positions
of police officers.

56:53.433 --> 56:54.400
This is enough, right?

56:55.266 --> 56:56.166
Good work.

56:58.466 --> 56:59.566
Let's begin the operation.

57:15.700 --> 57:17.466
The uranium enrichment has been completed.

57:18.033 --> 57:19.200
It took longer than I expected.

57:19.666 --> 57:22.000
You may open it. It's completely shielded.

57:28.566 --> 57:30.333
It completely holds in all radioactivity

57:30.400 --> 57:32.066
so even Geiger counters cannot detect it.

57:33.333 --> 57:35.933
You would have no problem
carrying it to the South.

57:42.433 --> 57:43.866
Here are the files that you requested.

57:44.733 --> 57:45.566
Good work.

57:46.300 --> 57:47.200
Okay.

57:49.733 --> 57:50.700
Sir.

57:54.366 --> 57:57.166
I'd like... a word with you.

57:57.900 --> 57:58.766
What is it?

58:00.133 --> 58:00.966
Sir!

58:02.533 --> 58:03.933
I found it.

58:05.033 --> 58:06.633
I tracked down an unregistered truck

58:07.133 --> 58:08.966
among the vehicles
that went through customs.

58:09.066 --> 58:10.300
It went by Seongnam.

58:10.833 --> 58:11.733
And after that?

58:11.866 --> 58:14.500
The video surveillance recorded
the truck heading to a hill in Geumgwang.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.700
There's a warehouse which recorded
high electricity usage from last week.

58:18.400 --> 58:20.133
Dispatch SWAT teams immediately.

58:20.900 --> 58:21.766
Yes, sir.

1:00:05.933 --> 1:00:07.300
Group 2 ready to enter.

1:00:08.233 --> 1:00:09.266
Group 3 ready to enter.

1:00:11.933 --> 1:00:12.800
Go.

1:01:07.400 --> 1:01:08.700
I think I figured out their target.

1:01:08.933 --> 1:01:11.266
Go back to the company and support them.

1:01:11.800 --> 1:01:13.933
Our target is the NSS.

1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:18.266
How can we get in there?

1:01:18.866 --> 1:01:19.800
There's no other way.

1:01:21.133 --> 1:01:22.400
The NSS is under attack right now!

1:01:23.066 --> 1:01:24.533
The company is in the hands of the enemy.

1:01:28.233 --> 1:01:29.900
Someone is communicating
with people outside.

1:01:30.066 --> 1:01:30.900
Where?

1:01:30.966 --> 1:01:32.166
The west section, one level down.

1:01:32.233 --> 1:01:33.133
Go and check it.

1:01:35.366 --> 1:01:36.266
Blow it up.

1:01:36.333 --> 1:01:39.066
We don't know what's going on inside.
It's currently too dangerous to go in.

1:01:39.700 --> 1:01:40.566
Blow it up right now.

1:01:42.033 --> 1:01:44.800
It's about time you tell me
why we broke into the NSS.

1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:46.000
Just do your job.

1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:12.766
As long as you bring the package...

1:02:45.666 --> 1:02:46.733
What is Iris?

1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:03.833
San Baek.

1:03:05.500 --> 1:03:06.833
the NSS Deputy Director.

1:03:08.833 --> 1:03:13.633
And the country that used me
and discarded me, the Republic of Korea.

1:03:15.266 --> 1:03:16.200
We're arriving soon.

1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:18.900
I want my revenge.
