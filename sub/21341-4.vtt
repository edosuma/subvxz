01:00.194 --> 01:01.562
What're you doing?

01:01.595 --> 01:04.165
Putting on lip gloss.

01:04.198 --> 01:07.501
- Why?
- Meh. Because.

01:07.535 --> 01:10.604
It's makeover time!

01:10.638 --> 01:13.574
- Hi, Robin!
- Hi, Sara. Hi, you.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.609
Hi...
What's a makeover?

01:15.643 --> 01:17.745
It's like dress-up,
for your face.

01:17.778 --> 01:20.581
When I grow up I wanna be
a makeup artist

01:20.614 --> 01:23.784
and do make up for
special effects and creatures.

01:23.817 --> 01:26.220
Wait-- I don't wanna
look like a werewolf.

01:26.254 --> 01:27.255
You won't!

01:27.288 --> 01:28.756
But Sara,

01:28.789 --> 01:31.559
I thought we were gonna do
a Dino Experiment today.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.893
Can we do it later?

01:32.926 --> 01:34.595
I... guess.

01:34.628 --> 01:37.531
Later's a great idea.

01:37.565 --> 01:38.832
See ya!

01:38.866 --> 01:39.833
Bye!

01:41.569 --> 01:43.804
[Robin]
Now, are you sure you don't

01:43.837 --> 01:45.673
wanna look like a werewolf?

01:46.740 --> 01:51.645
[***]

01:53.181 --> 01:54.548
What's wrong, nugget?

01:54.582 --> 01:56.817
Sara said we'd do
a Dino Experiment today,

01:56.850 --> 01:58.852
but now she's doing
makeovers with Robin.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.488
Why don't you invite
Riley over?

02:00.521 --> 02:01.755
She's at her grandma's.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.757
What about the kid
with the freckles?

02:03.791 --> 02:05.459
Those were chicken pox...

02:05.493 --> 02:07.795
But he's still not allowed out.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.797
What about your, uh...

02:09.830 --> 02:11.399
dino friends?

02:11.432 --> 02:13.801
Dad, dinosaurs
aren't my friends.

02:13.834 --> 02:17.538
They're my research subjects.
Dinosaurs don't make friends.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.673
- That's sad.
- Why?

02:21.742 --> 02:23.311
Just sounds lonely.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.812
I mean,
humans make friends.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.580
Why can't dinosaurs
have friends?

02:26.614 --> 02:28.916

02:32.553 --> 02:35.656
-Sink's not working.
-Thanks, Dad!

02:35.689 --> 02:36.657
Uh, you're welcome?

02:38.492 --> 02:41.495
Now to see which dinosaur
shows up for my experiment.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.424
[dino squawking and chirping]

03:17.565 --> 03:20.301
It has a long,
feathery tail...

03:20.334 --> 03:23.837
It's not big,
like turkey sized,

03:23.871 --> 03:25.673
and it has big buck teeth.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.276
[gasp]
It's the Incisivosaurus!

03:28.309 --> 03:30.878
And now I get to do
Dino Experiment number 517:

03:30.911 --> 03:33.781
"Did the Incisivosaurus
make friends?"

03:33.814 --> 03:35.449
But first...

03:35.483 --> 03:37.651
It's Incisivosaurus time!

03:38.719 --> 03:43.657
[***]

03:46.327 --> 03:48.296
What is she doing?

03:48.329 --> 03:51.432
She's becoming a dinosaur.
She does it all the time.

03:51.465 --> 03:54.535
It's like dress up, for science.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.972
Time for Dino Experiment 517:

03:59.006 --> 04:01.975
"Did the Incisivosaurus
make friends?"

04:02.009 --> 04:04.011
But where did it go?

05:07.074 --> 05:08.809
Some dinosaurs make friends

05:08.842 --> 05:11.078
so they can share food.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.347
So you're saying
your research subjects

have become your friends?

13:08.856 --> 13:10.223
I have so many questions.

13:10.257 --> 13:13.026
Why would she do that?
Can her babies hear her?

13:13.060 --> 13:15.562
How do I learn that song?

13:15.595 --> 13:17.831
Babies can hear their
mother's voices

13:17.865 --> 13:19.833
long before they're born.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.568
It's how they know
they're loved.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.536
Are you saying
the Spinosaurus,

13:23.570 --> 13:25.405
the biggest fish-
eating dinosaur ever,

13:25.438 --> 13:28.575
with the big sail on his back
and a crocodile-like snout,

13:28.608 --> 13:32.379
was singing a song to her babies
because they can hear her?

13:32.412 --> 13:34.147
Well...

13:34.181 --> 13:37.117
Your little brother or sister
can hear you right now,

13:37.150 --> 13:38.986
so it's entirely possible.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.387
[Dana]
Really?

13:40.420 --> 13:42.589
Now, let's all take a moment

13:42.622 --> 13:45.392
and say something special
to our babies.

13:45.425 --> 13:48.328
- Big sisters too.
- [Dana] What should I say?

13:48.361 --> 13:50.397
Whatever you want, nugget.

13:50.430 --> 13:56.003
[imitating Spinosaurus croak]

13:56.036 --> 13:57.537
I'm practicing
a Spinosaurus song.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.873
Why don't you try it
as a human?

13:59.907 --> 14:02.542
Oh, okay.
Hi, baby sister or brother.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.311
I'm your big sister, Dana,

14:04.344 --> 14:07.314
and I'm gonna show you
a lot of stuff...

14:07.347 --> 14:10.951
about dinosaurs and other
prehistoric creatures!

14:10.984 --> 14:12.085
[gasp]

14:12.119 --> 14:14.387
Dana, the baby just kicked!

14:14.421 --> 14:17.257
Wow, there it is again.
Someone's very excited!

14:17.290 --> 14:19.226
The baby must be
listening to you.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.560
Really?

14:20.593 --> 14:22.162
Well, it stopped kicking,

14:22.195 --> 14:24.965
but I think the baby
was trying to say hi.

14:24.998 --> 14:28.235
The baby was trying to
say hi to me from the inside?

14:28.268 --> 14:29.636
From the inside!

14:29.669 --> 14:32.105
I wonder if this means
the Spinosaurus babies

14:32.139 --> 14:34.474
can talk from the inside
of their eggs, too.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.409
There's only
one way to find out.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.512
It's Spinosaurus time!

Great...

The Spinosaurus babies

do they have?
