WEBVTT

00:02.358 --> 00:04.351
Hey, M.E. report on Walt McCready

00:04.485 --> 00:05.944
- just came over the fax.
- McCready?

00:06.153 --> 00:09.487
No signs of pre-death trauma,
no knife wounds,

00:09.615 --> 00:12.237
no petechial haemorrhaging
to indicate strangulation.

00:12.702 --> 00:16.071
Victim has a gunshot wound to the leg,
but it hardly killed him.

00:16.204 --> 00:18.910
Well, it backs the horseshit Doyle
Bennett was slinging this morning.

00:19.041 --> 00:22.706
Coover went rogue
and killed McCready over a wristwatch.

00:24.422 --> 00:25.832
You up on your paperwork?

00:26.215 --> 00:29.798
Yeah, I just got to get ready
for this AUSA interview.

00:30.636 --> 00:33.305
I don't suppose
you'll lose too much sleep over that.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.889
Well, Loretta McCready's
gonna corroborate

00:39.020 --> 00:40.893
everything that went down
with Coover Bennett.

00:41.022 --> 00:45.233
The one thing I'm worried about is dragging
that poor girl through this whole thing again.

00:45.359 --> 00:48.775
Well, the way you've described her,
she seems like a pretty tough cookie.

00:48.904 --> 00:51.442
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

00:53.659 --> 00:54.690
There something else?

00:56.912 --> 00:57.992
Is there?

00:58.622 --> 01:01.873
- No, we're done.
- Okay. We're done.

01:02.960 --> 01:04.703
That's what I said.

01:06.547 --> 01:08.338
Where do we go next?

01:09.550 --> 01:11.424
Well, you've got that AUSA meeting.

01:11.552 --> 01:13.461
Yeah, where do we go? We know that.

01:16.682 --> 01:18.057
Is there something on
your mind, Raylan?

01:19.518 --> 01:22.353
Look, Art,

01:22.480 --> 01:23.511
you and I...

01:25.483 --> 01:27.475
Shut that door.

01:31.489 --> 01:32.568
What?

01:32.823 --> 01:36.358
- I just want to get to the bottom of this.
- Why?

01:36.786 --> 01:39.324
Well, because I'd like to know
where I stand, moving forward.

01:39.455 --> 01:40.570
I don't think you would, Raylan.

01:40.998 --> 01:43.240
I think what you want is to walk in here
and have me go,

01:43.375 --> 01:47.373
"Just sit down, son. Tell me,
in your emotionally crippled way,

01:47.505 --> 01:51.668
"just what it is that's troubling your heart
so that we can get back what we've lost."

01:52.676 --> 01:54.301
Okay. Sorry. Forget it.

01:54.428 --> 01:55.459
No, no, no, no.

01:55.763 --> 01:58.847
You opened this can. Let's eat it all.
Get back in here.

02:02.061 --> 02:04.468
Let me tell you something, Raylan.

02:05.064 --> 02:07.637
Now, you know that thing
that never happened

02:07.775 --> 02:09.269
that we never talked about?

02:11.987 --> 02:14.110
We're not gonna talk about it.

02:16.158 --> 02:17.189
Okay.

02:18.077 --> 02:19.654
Now, do you understand
what that means?

02:20.121 --> 02:21.152
No.

02:21.330 --> 02:22.741
That means that I'm stuck with you.

02:24.542 --> 02:28.835
I'm stuck with a man who is a
lousy marshal, but a good lawman.

02:30.673 --> 02:33.128
And you are who you are.

02:33.259 --> 02:36.094
Nothing I say has ever
made any difference.

02:36.220 --> 02:39.340
No punishment that I can dream up
will ever change you.

02:42.810 --> 02:47.187
It kind of makes me sad, believe it or not,
because I thought at one point that

02:47.314 --> 02:51.442
maybe someday you and I'd be able to
look back on all this and laugh.

02:51.569 --> 02:55.613
But shit. I don't think
you're gonna live that long.

02:58.242 --> 03:01.528
You just go on and do what you do,
and I'll just keep cleaning up after you.

03:01.662 --> 03:05.790
And sooner or later,
this problem's gonna solve itself.

03:08.002 --> 03:09.793
Okay.

04:02.223 --> 04:05.722
How long's it been since we
sat across each other like this?

04:11.774 --> 04:13.054
What's this?

04:13.525 --> 04:15.233
Your share of Black Pike.

04:16.612 --> 04:17.642
Now?

04:17.779 --> 04:21.445
It's yours and we're square.
That's the deal, so take it.

04:23.118 --> 04:26.784
Business ought to stand aside
for other things, personal things.

04:27.373 --> 04:30.576
Helen, girl, business don't
stand aside for anything.

04:32.628 --> 04:36.922
And after losing Coover, I intend
to weigh all my debts and accounts.

04:38.592 --> 04:41.130
I know you're struggling.

04:41.262 --> 04:44.761
But I pray you'll reject
seeing the hand of fate in this.

04:45.224 --> 04:46.848
What else would you call it?

04:46.976 --> 04:48.719
Twenty years of peace,

04:48.852 --> 04:52.019
20 years we held it in our hands.

04:52.147 --> 04:53.392
The two of us.

04:56.193 --> 04:58.565
He had a job to do, protecting the girl.

04:59.613 --> 05:02.283
That may be so, but I hurt.

05:03.617 --> 05:05.277
I told him to stay clear
of you and your kin.

05:05.661 --> 05:07.369
And it happened just the same.

05:07.496 --> 05:12.870
What happens now is
not with fate or history or God.

05:13.669 --> 05:15.412
It's with you.

05:19.174 --> 05:20.585
Raylan killed my baby.

05:21.677 --> 05:26.386
It's a terrible loss. There's no doubt.

05:26.515 --> 05:30.679
But if you take the privilege,
where will it end?

05:38.235 --> 05:44.653
I don't know if it's design or accident
that gets these things started.

05:49.788 --> 05:55.079
What do we gain with
soaking these hills with more blood?

05:59.214 --> 06:02.381
Lid stays on, at my word.

06:15.397 --> 06:17.306
I have to go.

06:27.534 --> 06:28.697
Ms. Bennett.

06:31.747 --> 06:34.416
I want you to know
how sorry I am for your loss.

06:36.085 --> 06:37.413
- Thank you.
- Can't imagine what it'd be like

06:37.544 --> 06:39.252
losing one of my boys.

06:40.089 --> 06:43.588
I wonder if it'd be worse watching them
grow up in a holler that's all choked dead,

06:44.385 --> 06:47.054
the creeks all poisoned by slag.

06:47.471 --> 06:48.846
Least Coover went quick.

06:51.183 --> 06:53.508
I put my faith in you, Ms. Bennett!

06:53.644 --> 06:56.349
Your granddaddy and my granddaddy
spilled blood to

06:56.480 --> 06:58.769
keep the companies
from taking these hills.

06:58.899 --> 07:01.307
And then you give them away
with a piece of paper.

07:01.443 --> 07:03.566
- Hobart, you want to...
- You familiar with the Book of Isaiah?

07:04.530 --> 07:07.365
"Slaughter the sons
for the guilt of their fathers,

07:07.491 --> 07:10.278
"lest they fill the world with tyrants."

07:13.247 --> 07:15.074
Wherever your boys grow up,

07:15.207 --> 07:18.291
do you think they'd be better off
doing it with or without their daddy?

07:19.294 --> 07:24.003
You think about that next time
before you open your mouth to me.

07:37.896 --> 07:39.806
I was gonna make some eggs.

07:39.940 --> 07:41.220
I'm fine.

07:43.777 --> 07:45.271
That won't fill you up.

07:45.904 --> 07:47.861
I'm fine.

07:50.534 --> 07:55.112
You're not gonna sit with me
and have one last meal?

07:56.248 --> 07:58.241
I saw your bags packed in your room.

08:03.130 --> 08:06.914
Ava, I have to leave.

08:07.050 --> 08:12.258
I'm embarking upon a journey that
I can't rightly ask you to be a part of.

08:14.183 --> 08:15.760
How do you know?

08:16.268 --> 08:18.095
Because when you took me in,
you made it clear that

08:18.228 --> 08:20.636
you would not tolerate
any criminal activity.

08:21.982 --> 08:27.321
How hard did I enforce that law, Boyd?
I lied for you taking that mining money.

08:27.613 --> 08:28.941
This is different, Ava.

08:31.825 --> 08:36.155
I guess me taking you in
and building you up was a mistake.

08:36.288 --> 08:38.030
Just set you back to square one.

08:38.164 --> 08:40.833
That's not true.

08:40.958 --> 08:43.746
You took me in,
and you healed me, Ava.

08:43.879 --> 08:46.833
You give me a reason to
wake up in the morning.

08:48.133 --> 08:50.090
For that, I'll be eternally grateful.

08:53.680 --> 08:54.925
Get out.

09:07.569 --> 09:09.526
- Winona.
- You busy?

09:10.656 --> 09:12.364
- That it?
- Sorry?

09:12.866 --> 09:15.820
I've been calling you for three days,
calls you haven't returned.

09:15.953 --> 09:17.198
Now, you just come in here
and ask if I'm busy?

09:17.412 --> 09:19.903
I know. I'm sorry.
I had some late nights. And then,

09:20.290 --> 09:21.784
I got sick.
And I was gonna call you last night,

09:21.917 --> 09:23.115
but my cell phone died.

09:24.044 --> 09:25.075
Okay.

09:26.505 --> 09:29.078
- "Okay" what?
- Nothing. You asked if I was busy.

09:29.216 --> 09:30.840
- No, Raylan. What's the problem?
- Your cell died?

09:30.968 --> 09:33.340
That's something you tell your parents
if you're out past your curfew.

09:33.470 --> 09:35.344
Would you like to take a look at it?
Maybe you can figure out

09:35.472 --> 09:37.097
what the problem is,
because I sure as hell can't.

09:37.224 --> 09:39.300
Okay. Your cell is dead.

09:39.476 --> 09:41.184
I am sorry for your loss.

09:41.353 --> 09:43.511
- What can I do for you?
- You think I've been ducking your calls?

09:43.647 --> 09:45.438
- Clearly you haven't.
- Why would I be ducking your calls?

09:45.566 --> 09:47.891
I don't know. Tell me.

09:55.701 --> 09:57.278
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:59.079 --> 10:00.194
I was ducking your calls.

10:00.330 --> 10:02.489
But it was because
I thought you were still pissed at me.

10:02.624 --> 10:04.747
And my cell phone really did die.
And that's why I'm here now.

10:05.127 --> 10:08.875
Trust me, I would much rather have
had this conversation over the phone.

10:09.006 --> 10:11.579
Why didn't you just call me
from the landline in your office, then?

10:14.970 --> 10:16.713
- I didn't even think of that.
- Yeah.

10:16.847 --> 10:18.424
Anyway, I need a favour.

10:18.682 --> 10:20.057
Really?

10:20.392 --> 10:22.183
Yeah. I need a ride. My car won't start.

10:22.352 --> 10:25.852
I should instinctively say no, but
considering the favour you asked me last,

10:26.189 --> 10:28.348
this would be a piece of cake.
Where would you like to go?

10:29.109 --> 10:30.568
- Across town.
- To?

10:30.986 --> 10:33.607
To rob a bank. I need a wheel man.

10:33.739 --> 10:35.696
Very funny. Seriously.

10:37.534 --> 10:38.945
I'm just gonna get a cab.

10:39.494 --> 10:41.701
- Winona...
- It's all right.

10:44.708 --> 10:46.167
Corner of Cameron and Chase?

10:46.293 --> 10:47.491
Yeah.

10:50.672 --> 10:51.703
And what's there?

10:52.257 --> 10:53.835
My attorney's office.
I'm getting a divorce.

10:56.345 --> 10:57.424
Why didn't you tell me that?

10:57.679 --> 11:02.341
Because it's complicated, and it's
painful. Well, you know how it is.

11:07.689 --> 11:09.065
Have you been okay?

11:09.983 --> 11:11.181
What do you think?

11:12.027 --> 11:14.269
I don't know. That's why I'm asking.

11:14.404 --> 11:17.074
Have you been sleeping?
Have you been eating?

11:17.199 --> 11:20.069
Jesus. Are you...
Are you asking me if I've lost my mind?

11:20.202 --> 11:22.574
- No, I'm asking if you're okay.
- "Have you been sleeping?

11:22.704 --> 11:25.326
"Have you had thoughts of harming yourself
or others? Do you hear voices?"

11:25.457 --> 11:26.951
- Have you? Do you?
- I have not. No.

11:27.084 --> 11:29.491
- No. I'm fine, Raylan. I really am.
- Can I ask you a question?

11:30.879 --> 11:32.706
- Are you out of your mind?
- Oh, my God.

11:32.839 --> 11:33.919
You stole $200,000.

11:34.049 --> 11:36.088
- And I put it back.
- But you stole it.

11:36.218 --> 11:38.341
Well, you said you think about
that kind of shit all the time.

11:38.470 --> 11:41.471
Think about it. Never done it.
You know why? It's crazy.

11:41.598 --> 11:42.629
- I made one mistake.
- You went crazy.

11:42.766 --> 11:45.471
- I made a stupid mistake.
- I'd like to know if that's temporary.

11:45.852 --> 11:47.430
- What?
- What?

11:47.562 --> 11:49.436
You've been eyeballing that mirror
since we got in the car.

11:49.564 --> 11:52.768
It's called checking the mirrors.
It's safe driving, Winona.

11:52.901 --> 11:54.276
This job of yours.

11:54.403 --> 11:56.194
No, no. Don't turn this around on me.

11:56.321 --> 11:58.693
We're here to find out whether
you're cracking up.

11:58.824 --> 12:01.315
And you know what? I bet you,
you know the make and model of

12:01.451 --> 12:03.159
all five of the cars
that are behind us right now.

12:03.286 --> 12:04.781
Okay. First of all, there are only three.

12:04.913 --> 12:08.116
And one's a silver Cadillac that's
been with us since the courthouse.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.871
Now, what would you have done
with the money?

12:12.421 --> 12:13.998
Hold that thought.

12:20.262 --> 12:21.970
Hey, fellas.

12:22.597 --> 12:25.267
Forgive me. I can't tell if
you guys are following me or not,

12:25.392 --> 12:28.262
and I'm just a little out of sorts,
to be honest with you.

12:28.395 --> 12:30.222
I shot and killed a guy
just three days ago.

12:30.355 --> 12:33.142
So, at this intersection here,
I'm gonna go right.

12:33.692 --> 12:36.444
I want you two to go left. I go right.

12:37.070 --> 12:41.282
You go left. If you go right,

12:41.408 --> 12:44.195
then I'm gonna want some answers.

12:44.327 --> 12:45.490
All right. You guys have a good one.

12:51.793 --> 12:53.916
What was that about?

12:54.296 --> 12:56.087
Directions.

13:04.681 --> 13:06.508
Why are we stopping?
Are they following us again?

13:06.641 --> 13:08.681
No, no. They took a left.

13:09.394 --> 13:10.723
Well, I still need to be dropped off.

13:10.854 --> 13:12.514
- We're here.
- What?

13:13.273 --> 13:16.393
Corner of Cameron and Chase.
Isn't that what you said?

13:16.860 --> 13:18.402
Yeah.

13:19.571 --> 13:21.647
That doesn't mean I'm crazy.
There's a lot going on, Raylan.

13:23.533 --> 13:26.107
Look, honey, maybe we shouldn't
see each other for a little while.

13:28.497 --> 13:30.869
- What?
- I don't know. I...

13:30.999 --> 13:33.572
We keep thinking things are different
and that we've changed,

13:33.710 --> 13:35.999
but you're still getting out in traffic
and trying to stop people...

13:36.129 --> 13:38.418
Those guys took every turn
from the courthouse...

13:38.548 --> 13:39.829
- Let me finish.
- Why?

13:39.966 --> 13:41.544
So you can tell me
how much you hate my job and...

13:41.676 --> 13:42.839
Raylan, stop it.

13:42.969 --> 13:45.092
I don't want to get on you
about your job. I don't.

13:45.222 --> 13:50.049
But I can't seem to help myself,
which leads me to believe that,

13:50.185 --> 13:51.928
despite my best efforts,
maybe I haven't changed.

13:52.062 --> 13:54.268
- I'm not saying you haven't changed.
- Let me tell you something.

13:54.815 --> 13:59.061
When someone says, "It ain't you,
it's me," they mean, "It's you."

13:59.486 --> 14:00.814
- Not all the time.
- Yeah.

14:01.571 --> 14:03.315
- Why don't you take that? I need to go.
- The girl, Loretta.

14:03.448 --> 14:05.192
It's her social worker. Just wait.

14:08.537 --> 14:10.695
Emily. Hey. What's up?

14:10.831 --> 14:12.325
I'm in the middle of something.

14:13.625 --> 14:16.626
Okay. I can be there in 20 minutes.

14:16.753 --> 14:18.580
Fine, 10.

14:25.804 --> 14:27.298
- I got to go.
- I do, too.

14:30.267 --> 14:33.683
- Can you get a ride back?
- Yes. I will get a taxi. Thank you for the ride.

14:41.152 --> 14:43.726
Like I told you over the phone,
she said she would only talk to you.

14:43.864 --> 14:45.274
Well, she's been through a lot.

14:45.407 --> 14:47.364
They all have.

14:47.492 --> 14:49.651
Sorry. I have a huge case load today,

14:49.786 --> 14:52.787
and it doesn't matter to me if she
goes inside or back to the group home.

14:52.914 --> 14:54.029
But she has to decide.

14:54.165 --> 14:56.407
Okay. Thank you.

15:00.881 --> 15:04.830
Hey. You're holding things up here, girl.

15:06.344 --> 15:07.755
I don't know these people.

15:07.971 --> 15:12.348
Yeah. Well, I don't either, but she
says they're good Christian folk.

15:12.475 --> 15:13.590
She talks like Oprah.

15:13.727 --> 15:15.719
She says the kids are nice.

15:16.354 --> 15:18.845
I'll end up a babysitter,
wiping their butts.

15:20.108 --> 15:22.101
Well, they look potty-trained to me.

15:22.235 --> 15:23.777
I'll be trapped inside that house.

15:24.195 --> 15:25.358
That house looks nice.

15:25.780 --> 15:28.817
- I don't like it.
- The street looks nice. The trees are nice.

15:28.950 --> 15:31.239
I'm sure there are plenty of
other kids around here your age.

15:31.369 --> 15:33.825
I ain't a kid.

15:33.955 --> 15:37.455
Well, then,
what's the damn problem, huh?

15:37.584 --> 15:41.332
Why you got me all the way out here?

15:41.463 --> 15:42.577
I'm pissed.

15:42.714 --> 15:43.829
Okay.

15:45.926 --> 15:48.002
- Why'd they do it?
- Why'd who do what?

15:48.470 --> 15:50.509
Why'd they kill my daddy?

15:52.057 --> 15:54.382
He was a sad, old man.
What'd he ever do?

15:55.560 --> 15:58.597
Just how it broke, I suppose.

15:58.730 --> 16:03.356
Your daddy was stretched thin,
in business with some bad people.

16:04.527 --> 16:06.070
I miss my mama.

16:07.822 --> 16:09.317
I can imagine.

16:10.325 --> 16:12.816
But not my daddy.

16:12.953 --> 16:14.945
He was pitiful.

16:16.122 --> 16:17.403
Does that make me bad?

16:17.916 --> 16:20.668
Nope. No, it don't.

16:22.003 --> 16:24.541
Does it make me bad
if I'm glad Coover's dead?

16:25.674 --> 16:27.465
The world's better without him.

16:31.846 --> 16:35.050
All right. Loretta, here's the deal.

16:36.893 --> 16:38.387
Is this gonna be tough? Yeah.

16:39.437 --> 16:42.355
Lonely. But you're strong.

16:42.482 --> 16:44.475
You'll make friends. You'll meet boys.

16:44.901 --> 16:48.317
And best of all,
you'll be a big sister to those two.

16:48.446 --> 16:52.396
They're gonna look at you like
you got a light coming from the inside.

16:54.536 --> 16:56.327
Come on. Give it a shot.

16:59.874 --> 17:03.493
Your brother was a dim bulb,
but he had a knack.

17:04.921 --> 17:06.961
All that personal consumption, I guess.

17:08.967 --> 17:11.209
He could crossbreed,

17:11.344 --> 17:17.429
raise and lower the THC
like he was a conductor waving a wand.

17:21.771 --> 17:23.479
His way is dying.

17:28.486 --> 17:29.566
Tell him.

17:31.656 --> 17:33.649
Mom's giving you
what's left of the weed business.

17:38.455 --> 17:39.865
Okay.

17:40.749 --> 17:42.492
Then that's it.

17:43.293 --> 17:45.036
You and me are done.

17:49.340 --> 17:50.539
What?

17:50.800 --> 17:52.674
I'm settling accounts.

17:54.262 --> 17:58.046
To that end, I want you to leave Raylan
alone. We hold our side of the feud.

17:58.933 --> 18:01.851
I got other concerns.

18:01.978 --> 18:06.058
I got threats on account of Black Pike,
don't need more.

18:06.191 --> 18:10.402
Now, okay. Hold up here. What... Now...

18:10.528 --> 18:15.605
Do I need to remind us that
a Givens murdered a Bennett here?

18:16.618 --> 18:18.195
- Because of you.
- Because of me?

18:18.328 --> 18:21.911
Now, how in the world is that my fault?

18:22.373 --> 18:24.081
Don't ask questions
you don't want answered.

18:24.209 --> 18:27.660
Mama, it wasn't like I wanted
to give him up. I was tortured.

18:27.837 --> 18:29.296
- You should have taken it!
- Mom, I was tortured!

18:29.422 --> 18:30.833
Coover was gonna kill Loretta.

18:30.965 --> 18:34.216
And I did everything I could
to make sure he didn't hurt her,

18:34.344 --> 18:37.013
because I know how much
that girl means to you, Mama!

18:37.138 --> 18:40.341
And if he'd done it,
I'd have killed him myself!

18:43.478 --> 18:45.517
You went against the family,

18:46.106 --> 18:48.893
and not for the first time.

18:49.984 --> 18:52.191
Black Pike is the future.

18:52.320 --> 18:54.277
Its proceeds go to
your brother and his family.

18:54.405 --> 18:56.731
They are the future, not you.

18:59.202 --> 19:00.400
Mama...

19:08.253 --> 19:13.045
Brother, you know she ain't nowhere
near thinking straight on this.

19:13.174 --> 19:14.834
Her mind's all twisted up with grief.

19:14.968 --> 19:16.925
No, Dickie.

19:18.680 --> 19:21.764
It's been in the works.
And I'm with her on it.

19:26.646 --> 19:30.097
Is that right? Now, what did I expect?

19:30.233 --> 19:33.934
Of course. You and your boys will
get your future laid out for you.

19:34.070 --> 19:37.439
Yeah, but meanwhile,
the Bennett name ain't worth shit.

19:38.950 --> 19:41.441
Now you know, brother. You know.

19:41.578 --> 19:44.744
If we don't answer this killing,
we are nothing!

19:45.540 --> 19:46.703
Nothing!

19:46.833 --> 19:50.783
So, now you're gonna cast yourself as the
great protector of the Bennett family name?

19:51.337 --> 19:52.880
Ain't no one else seems willing.

19:54.048 --> 19:55.792
This ain't about our name, Dickie.

19:57.260 --> 20:01.340
It's about you wanting to put
Raylan Givens in the ground.

20:01.472 --> 20:04.046
- Is that right? Let me tell you something...
- You get the weed.

20:05.185 --> 20:09.099
You leave the rest, the
Oxy, meth, protection,

20:09.230 --> 20:12.267
whatever you and your brother
were scheming to get into.

20:14.277 --> 20:15.652
And why is that?

20:15.778 --> 20:19.112
Mama give Boyd Crowder free rein to
pursue whatever business he wanted.

20:22.702 --> 20:23.900
She told Boyd Crowder what?

20:24.204 --> 20:27.454
- You heard me. Okay, so let's just let it lie.
- She...

20:27.624 --> 20:29.284
Let it lie. Understand?

20:31.169 --> 20:32.711
Yeah.

20:33.129 --> 20:34.540
I do see.

20:37.217 --> 20:38.924
Quite clearly.

20:39.761 --> 20:42.049
- All right, Dickie.
- All right.

20:48.228 --> 20:52.095
I can't accept the murky language
in paragraphs four through seven.

20:52.232 --> 20:54.723
It's clear. It just happens not to be
your client's wishes.

20:54.859 --> 20:58.773
I'm not gonna budge on the
beneficiary. We've been over this.

20:59.405 --> 21:02.276
The first contracts stand,
and the beneficiary stands,

21:02.408 --> 21:05.445
and you can kick all you want,
but the policies predate the marriage,

21:05.578 --> 21:07.820
and any amendments that
have been made by your client,

21:07.956 --> 21:09.498
no matter how many
waivers you show me.

21:09.624 --> 21:10.869
Yeah, we'll see about that.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.749
Really, Gary?
We're gonna fight over insurance?

21:15.380 --> 21:16.922
What's next? Pocket lint?

21:17.048 --> 21:18.957
- Winona...
- Oh, God.

21:19.092 --> 21:20.171
Gary...

21:20.301 --> 21:23.219
- Okay. All right. We're done here for today.
- I'm sorry.

21:23.346 --> 21:26.845
There's nothing more to say.
These are very emotional times.

21:26.975 --> 21:29.263
You gave me no choice.

21:29.394 --> 21:32.679
You had a choice, Gary.
You just chose wrong.

21:33.481 --> 21:35.889
You know, I've rehearsed these words
in my head a thousand times,

21:36.025 --> 21:39.275
but sitting with you now,
all my words are gone.

21:41.823 --> 21:45.358
I've been doing
a lot of thinking about Daddy.

21:45.493 --> 21:49.906
He was a hard man with large
appetites and few graces.

21:50.915 --> 21:55.743
And I spent my whole life
trying to be a different kind of man.

21:56.421 --> 21:58.662
But looking back on it,

21:58.798 --> 22:05.679
I can see how he made it possible for us to
grow up in a world without want or hunger,

22:07.473 --> 22:09.632
how he helped those in need,

22:10.393 --> 22:14.806
and tried to bring a little order
to our corner of the world.

22:16.649 --> 22:21.110
I guess I understand, finally,
what he tried imperfectly to do.

22:22.739 --> 22:24.648
And I see value in that.

22:28.244 --> 22:31.411
Maybe that's why
I haven't come to you until now.

22:32.415 --> 22:36.199
I owe you an apology, a deep apology.

22:37.587 --> 22:40.292
I've just been trying to
find my way in the world.

22:41.591 --> 22:45.458
And while my intentions were good,
people got hurt.

22:47.055 --> 22:48.513
People died.

22:49.015 --> 22:51.932
Well, too bad for me
I wasn't one of them.

22:53.603 --> 22:56.972
Would you like to see the bag
I have to wear to piss and shit in?

22:58.358 --> 23:00.516
But if it helped you
find your way in the world, Boyd,

23:00.651 --> 23:03.273
well, then I guess it was worth it.

23:04.238 --> 23:07.738
Now, I'll think about your way
every time I empty it.

23:10.703 --> 23:12.162
Reach me my lighter.

23:17.627 --> 23:19.952
It's not just about me, Johnny.

23:22.757 --> 23:24.251
It's always about you, Boyd.

23:25.426 --> 23:27.419
I'm a different man now.

23:27.804 --> 23:30.508
And I understand that you and me,
we are one blood.

23:31.683 --> 23:33.971
Yeah? Is that right?

23:35.061 --> 23:37.267
Well, I'll tell you what.

23:39.482 --> 23:41.142
Why don't you go on out there,

23:41.275 --> 23:44.810
and you get yourself cut in half
by a shotgun blast,

23:44.946 --> 23:47.152
then stuck back together again?

23:47.281 --> 23:49.404
And then, when you come back here,

23:49.534 --> 23:52.867
we can talk about being
one blood, cousin.

23:54.455 --> 23:57.077
Yeah. They still work.

23:57.208 --> 23:59.616
For shit, but they work.

24:06.676 --> 24:09.677
You think you performed
a miracle on me?

24:09.804 --> 24:11.678
I don't believe in miracles any more.

24:13.433 --> 24:15.342
Well, that is something, anyway.

24:18.563 --> 24:21.232
I do appreciate the
money that you sent.

24:23.234 --> 24:24.609
Beer ain't free.

24:30.825 --> 24:32.153
We about done here now?

24:36.789 --> 24:39.031
- I need you, Johnny.
- For what?

24:39.167 --> 24:41.539
To do what Daddy only dreamed of.

24:41.669 --> 24:44.789
Bring Harlan County
back under Crowder control.

24:45.423 --> 24:50.583
Now, it's not gonna be easy,
and it's not gonna happen overnight.

24:50.720 --> 24:52.796
But it is gonna happen.

24:52.930 --> 24:55.765
You and me, we're gonna do it.

24:55.975 --> 24:57.517
What the hell use am I gonna be?

24:58.227 --> 25:01.892
Johnny, I know you think that
you are a broken man,

25:02.023 --> 25:05.226
but from where I sit, I
see things different.

25:05.359 --> 25:07.317
Don't sell me, Boyd.
I don't want to hear it.

25:07.487 --> 25:09.278
I'm not selling!

25:09.405 --> 25:11.445
Now, Daddy did all of his business
out of the back of that bar.

25:11.574 --> 25:13.317
Now, you know what he did right

25:13.451 --> 25:16.203
and what he did wrong
better than any man alive.

25:16.329 --> 25:20.373
What the hell makes you think,
after all I been through,

25:20.500 --> 25:23.454
that I would lift a goddamn finger
to help you?

25:23.711 --> 25:27.412
Because you're a Crowder.

25:27.548 --> 25:29.755
It's in your blood.

26:18.307 --> 26:19.386
Jed.

26:20.101 --> 26:25.475
Dickie. Hey. Wow.
Came in fat this year, huh?

26:25.606 --> 26:27.017
Must have been those rains.

26:27.275 --> 26:28.852
Must have been, must have been.

26:29.318 --> 26:31.988
Hey, I'm real sorry about Coover.

26:33.072 --> 26:34.899
Appreciate the sentiment.

26:35.032 --> 26:39.825
Jed, you've been with the family
quite a while now, ain't that right?

26:39.954 --> 26:43.619
I guess, you know, since
I was 17, on and off.

26:43.749 --> 26:49.088
Seventeen. Well, now,
the reason I ask you here, Jed, is,

26:49.213 --> 26:51.669
there's gonna be some changes. Okay?

26:51.799 --> 26:54.041
Mama is stepping down,

26:54.176 --> 26:58.885
and someone else is stepping up.

26:59.974 --> 27:01.053
All right.

27:01.851 --> 27:03.890
Yeah. With my brother gone and all.

27:04.228 --> 27:06.304
May he rest in peace.

27:06.439 --> 27:10.388
So, I was doing some thinking,
you know, and it occurred to me that

27:10.526 --> 27:15.318
maybe, just maybe, you might want
the opportunity to step up, too.

27:16.699 --> 27:19.534
- Well, hell, yeah.
- "Hells yes," he says.

27:19.660 --> 27:22.151
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Well, now, here's the thing,

27:22.288 --> 27:23.568
gonna mean more responsibility.

27:24.290 --> 27:28.537
Hey, shit, Dickie, I got mouths to feed.
I will do what I got to do.

27:29.795 --> 27:34.790
Yeah. It would mean
getting your hands a little dirty.

27:36.594 --> 27:37.625
Like I said.

27:39.430 --> 27:42.347
And just so we're clear, didn't you...

27:42.475 --> 27:45.678
You did some work for the Crowders
back in the day, did you not?

27:48.522 --> 27:50.645
Yes, Dickie. Sure. Who didn't?

27:51.651 --> 27:55.102
Any loyalty going on there?
Conflict-of-interest type thing?

27:55.237 --> 27:57.396
Not on my part. Nor theirs.

28:01.452 --> 28:02.863
Well,

28:07.124 --> 28:08.204
all right.

28:09.960 --> 28:11.289
All right.

28:13.464 --> 28:15.338
Bet. $150.

28:19.303 --> 28:21.343
We're hoping to get a little action?

28:21.472 --> 28:23.263
Is that right, wheels?

28:23.391 --> 28:26.345
Well, buy-in is $500,
and 5% of each pot goes to the house.

28:26.477 --> 28:28.137
Well, I think we're fine with that.

28:29.063 --> 28:30.178
And no firearms.

28:30.314 --> 28:32.556
We're not carrying,
but you do what you must.

28:33.401 --> 28:34.432
Raise.

28:37.488 --> 28:39.564
- Three hundred.
- Call.

28:42.451 --> 28:44.408
Devil.

28:44.537 --> 28:48.404
Boyd. Johnny.
Didn't know you boys played.

28:49.458 --> 28:50.739
Devil? Cute.

28:50.876 --> 28:52.287
Well, it's an honorary title.

28:54.255 --> 28:57.375
How do you like them wheels, huh? You
get your face up against that fence!

28:57.508 --> 28:59.417
Well, Johnny,
I wasn't ready to start this show,

28:59.552 --> 29:01.094
but since you already
pulled back the curtains,

29:01.220 --> 29:03.462
- kindly do what this man asked.
- Okay. Okay.

29:03.764 --> 29:06.967
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
pull out all your cash.

29:07.101 --> 29:09.094
Put everything on the table right now
with alacrity.

29:09.228 --> 29:11.801
Put your face down on the floor. Now.

29:11.939 --> 29:13.517
Devil, pick up that cash, and let's go.

29:15.985 --> 29:17.360
- You serious?
- Well, I came here for you,

29:17.486 --> 29:19.479
but I'll leave with all your money,
if that's what you prefer.

29:20.114 --> 29:21.608
What you offering?

29:21.741 --> 29:25.904
Same as before,
only of a much, much bigger pie.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.325
I'm gonna find you assholes.

29:34.128 --> 29:37.497
My name's Boyd Crowder.
You can come after me if you want,

29:37.631 --> 29:41.546
but it'll be the last thing you ever do.
I promise you that.

29:54.607 --> 29:56.564
- You got my note.
- I did.

29:56.692 --> 29:58.186
You left a bunch of
Post-its leading up to it,

29:58.319 --> 30:01.273
- so it was kind of hard to miss.
- How was the meeting with the lawyers?

30:01.405 --> 30:04.276
It sucked.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?

30:06.035 --> 30:10.863
You said today that we shouldn't see
each other for a while because...

30:10.998 --> 30:16.372
Because I don't want you to think
this divorce is to pressure you.

30:16.504 --> 30:18.295
I'm divorcing Gary because
Gary and I are done.

30:19.298 --> 30:20.876
That seems like pretty sane thinking.

30:21.175 --> 30:24.508
Well, it might just be
the sanest thing I've done in a while.

30:24.637 --> 30:27.044
And, look, you're not the only one
who's worried about my sanity.

30:27.181 --> 30:31.095
I go to bed at night, and I wake
up, thinking, "What did I do?"

30:31.227 --> 30:33.634
I've been thinking the same thing.

30:33.771 --> 30:37.222
Not about you, about me. You know...

30:39.944 --> 30:41.354
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

30:42.279 --> 30:44.735
You see these old-timers right here?

30:45.783 --> 30:49.033
Well, I don't think a week goes by

30:49.870 --> 30:52.029
I don't look at them and wonder,

30:52.373 --> 30:53.831
"Should I grow a moustache?"

30:55.584 --> 30:59.119
No.
I wonder how I'd stack up against them.

31:00.422 --> 31:04.254
And after last week, I'd say not so well.

31:05.052 --> 31:08.006
I've been wondering if
I'm just a criminal at heart,

31:08.764 --> 31:10.721
you know, truly my father's son.

31:10.850 --> 31:13.138
But then you got out of the car today
without kissing me,

31:14.562 --> 31:17.562
and I think, "Bullshit."
I didn't help you because I'm an outlaw.

31:17.690 --> 31:20.228
I helped you because
I'm in love with you.

31:22.903 --> 31:24.101
That's sweet, Raylan.

31:25.739 --> 31:27.068
"That's sweet," huh?

31:28.826 --> 31:30.368
Of course you're in love with me.

31:31.579 --> 31:36.039
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, and I love you back. Now what?

31:40.087 --> 31:41.878
Yeah...

31:48.053 --> 31:49.133
Glynco.

31:49.805 --> 31:51.003
Glynco?

31:51.432 --> 31:53.638
Yeah. I mean...

31:54.268 --> 31:57.352
You were happy.
I liked teaching kids how to shoot.

31:57.479 --> 31:59.104
Yeah, well, I liked you being there.

31:59.231 --> 32:01.105
I liked knowing that,
unless one of those kids misfired,

32:01.233 --> 32:02.775
you were gonna
walk through the door at night.

32:03.110 --> 32:04.485
So?

32:04.612 --> 32:07.103
So? Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

32:07.239 --> 32:09.611
If you think I'm saying, "Let's
go to Glynco," then, yeah.

32:11.327 --> 32:12.821
There's a lot of history there.

32:12.995 --> 32:14.489
So what?

32:14.622 --> 32:17.576
Running into history everywhere.
I'm sick of that shit.

32:17.708 --> 32:21.291
The fact is, I'm done here.
Or at least Art's done with me, and...

32:21.795 --> 32:23.455
So, you got nothing better to
do with your life.

32:23.589 --> 32:25.249
You might as well just
run off with your ex.

32:25.799 --> 32:27.626
Exactly.

32:29.261 --> 32:30.257
Wow.

32:31.388 --> 32:32.420
Glynco.

32:34.558 --> 32:35.637
Can I think about it?

32:36.143 --> 32:38.301
Really? You're serious?

32:38.437 --> 32:39.552
Yeah.

32:40.105 --> 32:41.220
I thought this is what you wanted.

32:41.357 --> 32:44.227
- Yeah, well, it was something I wanted.
- "Was"?

32:45.819 --> 32:46.934
Raylan, I don't know if you've noticed,

32:47.071 --> 32:50.072
but there's a lot of stuff
going on in my life right now.

32:50.199 --> 32:53.319
Well, shit. Thank God I
didn't get down on one knee.

32:53.452 --> 32:56.903
I didn't say no.
I just said I wanted to think about it.

32:58.332 --> 32:59.707
All right.

33:02.628 --> 33:04.870
- You still need a ride?
- I do.

33:08.592 --> 33:11.130
Now, we all know it
takes muscle and money.

33:11.261 --> 33:14.630
Now, we got a bit of both,
but we're gonna need more soon.

33:14.765 --> 33:17.719
I'll take point on muscle. You know me.
People person.

33:18.102 --> 33:20.853
We're also gonna need a home base.
Can't do much out in the open like this.

33:20.980 --> 33:24.929
Well, maybe it's time we had a word
with that fat man who stole your bar.

33:25.067 --> 33:26.561
He'll get more than a word.

33:26.694 --> 33:30.312
Now, once we got infrastructure,
and we got everything in line,

33:30.447 --> 33:33.816
- we're gonna have to make our grand debut.
- Well, what do you got in mind?

33:33.951 --> 33:35.659
Well, there are any number of ways to
get out the message.

33:35.786 --> 33:39.914
The trick is picking
the right messenger.

33:40.040 --> 33:42.614
Now, I've been doing a
little bit of thinking...

33:42.751 --> 33:44.874
Boyd, Johnny. Hey.

33:48.298 --> 33:50.920
- Don't know you.
- Well, we can change that.

33:51.301 --> 33:53.875
Well, maybe we could,
but I'm here to talk to this man,

33:54.013 --> 33:57.713
so you can put your face back in
whatever it is you got going on there.

33:57.850 --> 34:00.601
- What is that, a milkshake?
- Keep it up, rabbit.

34:02.187 --> 34:05.141
Boyd, I just wanted you to know
whatever words were said

34:05.274 --> 34:08.607
between you and my mama,
whatever deal you made, it's off.

34:09.194 --> 34:12.398
Your arrangement with
the Bennetts is done.

34:12.531 --> 34:16.362
The Bennetts? Didn't they used to be
a swinging dick around here?

34:16.493 --> 34:18.864
Then, one of them boys...
What the hell's his name?

34:18.996 --> 34:22.946
Hooter or Booger, got killed, put the
rest of them up against the wall.

34:23.083 --> 34:24.791
You about done?

34:24.918 --> 34:27.291
What, you need a little more time to
go on entertaining yourself?

34:27.795 --> 34:29.623
What do you think?

34:30.591 --> 34:33.876
Boyd, let's see, now.

34:34.011 --> 34:38.472
Your daddy's gone, your men are dead.
Take one look at Johnny over here.

34:38.599 --> 34:39.974
Can't we all get around the fact that

34:40.100 --> 34:43.386
he ain't much more than a man
that you put in a wheelchair?

34:43.520 --> 34:45.264
And milkshake over here,

34:45.397 --> 34:47.971
well, he probably has to whistle
when he takes a shit

34:48.108 --> 34:49.733
so he knows which end to wipe.

34:49.860 --> 34:51.438
Boy, he ain't just handsome.
He's funny.

34:51.945 --> 34:57.402
Point I'm coming down to, Boyd, I
believe you need to know what's what.

34:58.160 --> 35:00.485
So, here's what's what.

35:00.621 --> 35:03.622
Town of Bennett, that would be mine.

35:03.749 --> 35:08.743
Harlan, well,
you can bet that's gonna be mine.

35:08.879 --> 35:13.920
And you,
you're welcome to join me, all right?

35:14.051 --> 35:17.550
Or you can just get yourself
across the county line.

35:22.184 --> 35:23.892
Gentlemen.

35:36.448 --> 35:41.027
That's right.
That's right, rabbit. Hop away.

35:43.914 --> 35:46.239
What do you want me to do about him?

35:47.251 --> 35:48.330
Nothing.

35:49.503 --> 35:51.745
We just found our messenger.

35:59.429 --> 36:00.972
You mind the radio?

36:01.098 --> 36:02.841
No, no. Not at all.

36:05.352 --> 36:10.310
There you go. No, no, no.
The other one. Yeah, give that a shot.

36:12.568 --> 36:18.108
A voice like this grates on you at first,
but then, maybe, you'll learn to like it.

36:19.199 --> 36:22.117
Like Neil Young.
Didn't like him, then I did.

36:22.244 --> 36:24.486
- Well, he's Neil Young.
- National treasure.

36:24.830 --> 36:27.784
- He's Canadian.
- Then I guess he sucks.

36:35.924 --> 36:38.296
Are you all right? Get down.

36:43.891 --> 36:46.429
Okay, come on. Stay down.

37:00.199 --> 37:02.524
Hi. This is Deputy US Marshal
Raylan Givens.

37:02.659 --> 37:07.037
I'm with a civilian, female.
We're under fire from two men, white.

37:07.164 --> 37:10.580
- Taking cover in the offices of...
- Bowen Prefab.

37:10.709 --> 37:14.873
Bowen Prefab on the southeast corner
of Williams and Byng.

37:15.005 --> 37:17.922
I don't know what colour it is.
It's the one with the ringing bells.

37:18.342 --> 37:20.418
- Who are they?
- Lord knows.

37:20.552 --> 37:22.426
Any number of people
are trying to kill me.

37:24.890 --> 37:26.301
Right here.

37:26.600 --> 37:29.969
- Okay. Now, you still go to the range?
- What?

37:30.103 --> 37:32.013
- The shooting range?
- I haven't been in years.

37:32.147 --> 37:34.638
But you remember what they
taught you, right? Centre mass?

37:34.775 --> 37:38.060
Okay, now, if these two get by me,
you keep shooting till they stop moving

37:38.195 --> 37:39.986
- or you run out of bullets.
- Where are you going?

37:40.113 --> 37:41.276
- Now, if they come...
- Raylan...

37:41.406 --> 37:42.486
you keep shooting.

37:42.616 --> 37:43.944
Why don't you stay here,
and we both keep shooting?

37:44.076 --> 37:45.321
Centre mass.

39:09.286 --> 39:10.365
Yes.

39:12.622 --> 39:14.449
"Yes"?

39:14.583 --> 39:15.781
Glynco.

39:32.142 --> 39:34.218
Mr. Crowder?

39:40.317 --> 39:42.393
Beautiful night.

39:43.570 --> 39:47.153
I thought so.
I came out to see the stars.

39:49.534 --> 39:53.947
I guess it must be mighty confusing,
me being here.

39:54.998 --> 39:59.874
Truth be told, I had to see you one more
time, even if it was from a distance.
