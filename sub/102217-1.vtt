We don't know what's going on in there.

10:28.558 --> 10:32.050

- Yes, sir.

10:55.225 --> 10:59.138

U.S.-made and tricky.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.507
Yes, sir.

11:00.642 --> 11:03.509
If the power isn't restored,

11:03.933 --> 11:07.801
the water in the reactor
will dry up and overheat.

11:08.142 --> 11:12.010
Then it's a matter of time
before the fuel melts.

11:12.933 --> 11:16.721

we'll all be exposed and it's over.

11:26.850 --> 11:30.798
We have to inject water
into the reactors to prevent that.

11:31.392 --> 11:35.089
We can use the fire-fighting pipeline
to send water.

11:35.308 --> 11:37.890

11:47.517 --> 11:49.428
We think alike.

11:49.517 --> 11:52.964
Without pumps, only fire
trucks can feed water.

11:53.475 --> 11:54.840
Mr. yoshida!

11:55.600 --> 11:58.763
Two fire trucks are down
because of the Tsunami.

11:59.267 --> 12:00.347
And the third?

12:00.600 --> 12:01.635
It works

12:01.725 --> 12:04.387
but wreckage is preventing it from moving.

12:04.642 --> 12:06.178
Do whatever it takes!

12:06.267 --> 12:07.507
Yes, sir!

12:07.975 --> 12:11.047
Only one truck isn't enough!

12:11.350 --> 12:15.138

- Yes.

15:14.142 --> 15:15.507
"Water pipe"

15:24.975 --> 15:27.136
- Switch to manual mode.
- Yes.

15:38.058 --> 15:40.219
Valve 365, opened.

15:40.308 --> 15:42.720
Valve 365 opened, check.

16:24.558 --> 16:27.675
Valve 25a is open.

16:27.767 --> 16:31.885
Valve 25a opened, check.

16:32.350 --> 16:35.342
We can send in water now.

16:35.433 --> 16:36.433
Yes.

16:41.558 --> 16:43.719
- You ok?
- Bring water!

16:43.808 --> 16:46.180
Good work!

16:47.892 --> 16:51.384
Radiation was 1.2msv near the double doors.

16:52.392 --> 16:55.759
Something is wrong in unit 1.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.880
The reactor water level could be low.

17:04.349 --> 17:07.672
Radiation in the unit 1
building is 1.2msv/hr.

17:07.892 --> 17:11.134
Something might be
malfunctioning in unit 1.

17:13.142 --> 17:15.723
High radiation level in unit 1.

17:15.808 --> 17:18.800
1.2msv/hr.

17:23.433 --> 17:26.755
Higuchi, aren't the power-supply
cars being flown in?

17:27.058 --> 17:28.513
- I'm working on it!
- Faster!

17:28.600 --> 17:29.600
Yes

17:30.683 --> 17:32.844
I know that. Hold on, geez.

17:34.267 --> 17:35.701
We're calling it off!

17:35.725 --> 17:37.076
"4 hours 3 minutes after quake"

17:37.100 --> 17:39.056
the power-supply cars
were too heavy to lift.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.385
"Emergency helicopter pad"

17:40.558 --> 17:41.468
what now?

17:41.558 --> 17:44.265
Under discussion. But this is canceled.

17:44.975 --> 17:45.975
Canceled!

17:46.017 --> 17:48.303
Canceled! Helicopters aren't coming.

17:48.642 --> 17:51.805
Canceled! Canceled! No helicopters!

17:54.517 --> 17:56.159
"4 hours 59 minutes after quake"

17:56.183 --> 17:58.063
"prime minister's office,
press conference room"

18:04.558 --> 18:07.925
Today, at 16:36, there was

18:08.225 --> 18:12.047
an event at the fukushima
daiichi nuclear power plant.

18:12.267 --> 18:16.840
It falls under the act
on special measures concerning

18:17.058 --> 18:20.926
nuclear emergency preparedness
article 15, paragraph 1, item 2.

18:21.058 --> 18:24.050
We recognize that this situation requires

18:24.142 --> 18:27.760
an emergency response to
stop further expansion of nuclear hazard,

18:27.933 --> 18:29.548
so in accordance with regulations

18:29.767 --> 18:33.715
a state of emergency has been declared.

18:34.433 --> 18:35.798
At the moment,

18:36.433 --> 18:38.890
oh, grandpa, I'll do that.

18:39.933 --> 18:41.784
Haruka, put broken things in this.

18:41.808 --> 18:43.076
"Izaki residence, tomioka town"

18:43.100 --> 18:44.180
ok.

18:44.558 --> 18:46.674
No reports of major problems,

18:47.225 --> 18:49.716
so please stay calm...

18:50.142 --> 18:52.929
State of emergency, huh?

19:03.058 --> 19:05.265
Your father will be fine.

19:05.933 --> 19:07.924
He's been there for decades.

19:09.225 --> 19:10.465
Yeah.

19:18.933 --> 19:20.909
Residents must evacuate. Don't panic,
stay calm and promptly evacuate.

19:20.933 --> 19:23.845
"6 hours 4 minutes after quake"

19:24.267 --> 19:26.909
don't panic, stay calm
and promptly evacuate.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.453
"Residents within a 2km radius of
the plant ordered to evacuate"

19:30.433 --> 19:32.173
I repeat...

19:32.392 --> 19:34.348
Why must we evacuate?

19:34.433 --> 19:37.049
Why do we have to leave?

19:38.808 --> 19:40.264
Trouble at the plant?

19:40.350 --> 19:42.841
I don't know. Just go quickly.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.993
Good, it worked.

19:46.017 --> 19:47.159
"Futaba town office"

19:47.183 --> 19:48.764
there's a traffic jam there.

19:48.850 --> 19:50.386
Can't get through to daiichi?

19:50.475 --> 19:51.305
Not yet.

19:51.433 --> 19:55.130
Got through to daini!
Daiichi still doesn't have power.

19:55.225 --> 19:56.965
No power? What the hell?

19:57.058 --> 20:01.051
Chief! The government
is sending 60 buses for evacuation!

20:01.267 --> 20:03.724
It's too late now!

20:04.433 --> 20:07.095
What are we going to do about iodine?

20:07.392 --> 20:10.134
Hq, we need clear guidance!

20:13.683 --> 20:17.631
As per the regulation
of the nuclear safety commission,

20:17.767 --> 20:21.885
younger people should take it,
but those over 40 don't have to.

20:22.017 --> 20:25.805
But it's unfair to draw that line
if they're all going in.

20:27.058 --> 20:29.299
The radiation level is rising.

20:29.475 --> 20:32.342
We can't approach if it gets higher.

20:33.142 --> 20:36.885
Those on-site are risking their lives!
Decide!

20:37.892 --> 20:40.599
Mr. yoshida, give us time.

20:40.683 --> 20:42.924
We'll ask the nuclear safety commission.

20:43.142 --> 20:45.724
Hq can't even handle this?

20:46.558 --> 20:48.799
The power-supply vehicles are here!

20:50.225 --> 20:51.886
We can do this!

21:00.058 --> 21:01.719
How did this happen?

21:01.808 --> 21:03.093
The voltage is different.

21:03.183 --> 21:07.506
We needed high-voltage
but the vehicles we got were low.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.966
What the hell is hq doing?

21:10.475 --> 21:11.931
Idiots!

21:14.183 --> 21:15.593
Thanks.

21:19.017 --> 21:20.757
Hurry, nishikawa!

21:20.850 --> 21:22.886
- I am!
- Don't talk back.

21:23.142 --> 21:26.714
Can't we connect a cable
from the seismic isolation building?

21:26.808 --> 21:28.423
It's 350m away. Too far.

21:28.517 --> 21:31.304
It'll take days to set up that heavy cable.

21:31.433 --> 21:32.548
Steady, now.

21:32.642 --> 21:33.802
Next!

21:34.433 --> 21:36.048
You have batteries?

21:36.142 --> 21:37.382
Thank you.

21:39.142 --> 21:41.383
Nishikawa, I can't see!

21:41.600 --> 21:43.056
Sorry.

21:46.433 --> 21:48.264
Miyamoto, it's connected!

21:48.517 --> 21:49.723
Got it!

21:49.808 --> 21:50.968
Here it comes.

21:51.225 --> 21:54.183
Mr. lzaki, the pressure
indicator is working!

21:54.392 --> 21:55.632
What does it say?

21:58.517 --> 22:00.098
600 kilopascals.

22:00.725 --> 22:01.931
600kpa?

22:02.017 --> 22:06.465
The containment vessel's
pressure limit is 427kpa.

22:06.642 --> 22:08.223
1.5 times more.

22:08.600 --> 22:11.216
It could burst at any time.

22:11.767 --> 22:13.678
We have to vent.

22:13.892 --> 22:14.892
Vent...

22:24.350 --> 22:32.350
Unit 1, containment
vessel pressure, 600kpa.

22:32.767 --> 22:34.052
6007?

22:34.433 --> 22:35.673
What?

22:39.225 --> 22:41.932
We have to depressurize unit 1.

22:42.308 --> 22:45.755
Get ready to vent. Check the other plants.

22:46.308 --> 22:47.673
Yes, sir.

22:53.725 --> 22:54.840
Izaki, it's me.

22:55.100 --> 22:56.340
Yoshi.

22:56.725 --> 22:58.932
How long will the reactor last?

23:00.225 --> 23:01.840
Until morning at best.

23:19.058 --> 23:23.131
When there's too much pressure,
this vessel will explode.

23:23.225 --> 23:24.993
To prevent that,
it's necessary to release some pressure.

23:25.017 --> 23:26.297
"10 hours 6 minutes after quake"

23:27.558 --> 23:28.764
that's called venting.

23:28.850 --> 23:33.970
But doesn't that mean
the surrounding area will be contaminated?

23:34.100 --> 23:37.763
If it explodes,
even more radiation will contaminate

23:37.850 --> 23:40.762
all of eastern Japan.

23:41.350 --> 23:46.390
Of course we'll make sure residents
are evacuated before venting.

23:46.767 --> 23:52.342
And the released air will travel through
water in this suppression chamber.

23:52.475 --> 23:57.048
So the amount of radiation
should be reduced to about 0.1 percent.

23:57.142 --> 23:58.302
"Should be"?

23:58.392 --> 24:02.055
Venting has never been
performed anywhere before.

24:02.767 --> 24:04.348
First time ever?

24:04.433 --> 24:05.673
Yes.

24:05.892 --> 24:09.384
But the power is out
so it has to be done manually.

24:09.642 --> 24:14.215
Someone must go inside
the contaminated reactor building.

24:15.225 --> 24:18.092
Don't say that so easily!

24:18.267 --> 24:20.758
You know how dangerous it is

24:20.850 --> 24:21.970
to vent with no electricity!

24:22.058 --> 24:23.343
I know that!

24:23.475 --> 24:26.547
But we've no choice. We
already told the pm.

24:26.642 --> 24:30.385
Of course,
we'll handle the venting responsibly.

24:30.517 --> 24:31.848
We're already on it.

24:31.933 --> 24:35.551
But don't say things
without consulting with us first!

24:35.683 --> 24:38.049
We'll decide how and when.

24:38.142 --> 24:40.178
Calm down!

24:42.683 --> 24:44.844
God damn it!

25:28.308 --> 25:29.388
Izaki speaking.

25:30.017 --> 25:31.132
Izaki.

25:33.892 --> 25:35.348
Please do it.

25:36.058 --> 25:38.174
Got it. We have to hurry.

25:41.933 --> 25:45.130
Decide who will go in to do the venting.

25:47.100 --> 25:48.340
Yeah.

26:06.058 --> 26:07.173
Guys.

26:16.433 --> 26:19.391
We're venting unit 1.

26:20.267 --> 26:23.430
This means releasing radiation
into the vicinity.

26:25.017 --> 26:27.633
We have to decide who'll go.

26:28.558 --> 26:34.599
As we all know, the building is dark
and we don't know what's going on.

26:35.517 --> 26:38.008
The radiation level is high.

26:38.642 --> 26:42.180
So I can't send the young ones in.

26:44.267 --> 26:47.839
If you're willing to volunteer,
please raise your hand.

27:11.683 --> 27:16.052
Is there anyone willing to come with me?

27:19.808 --> 27:21.969
I'll go in.

27:22.100 --> 27:24.182
You stay here, lzaki.

27:24.725 --> 27:26.010
He's right.

27:26.183 --> 27:30.096
You stay here and take command. I'll go.

27:30.683 --> 27:32.344
I'll go.

27:34.850 --> 27:36.135
I'll go.

27:36.225 --> 27:37.225
I'll go, too.

27:37.308 --> 27:39.264
- I'll go, too.
- Me too.

27:39.392 --> 27:40.632
I can do it.

27:40.725 --> 27:41.725
I'll go.

27:42.100 --> 27:43.431
Thank you.

27:50.683 --> 27:53.516
Thank you all.

27:54.183 --> 27:56.469
But not the young ones.

27:56.850 --> 28:01.344
Please let me choose 3 pairs of 6 veterans.

28:01.475 --> 28:02.635
At fukushima daiichi,

28:02.683 --> 28:03.826
"fukushima daiichi, 3km
radius evacuation zone"

28:03.850 --> 28:06.842
the pressure inside
the containment vessel is rising

28:07.058 --> 28:10.534
so they're going to release
some pressure by opening the valves.

28:10.558 --> 28:12.264
"12 hours 20 minutes after quake"

28:12.392 --> 28:14.599
when's that happening?

28:15.058 --> 28:19.552
We've told the site
to aim for 3 A.M. to carry it out.

28:19.767 --> 28:21.132
It's already past 3 A.M.

28:21.225 --> 28:24.763
Uh, I meant
they're getting started around 3 A.M.

28:24.892 --> 28:28.009
I've been told they've begun the process,

28:28.892 --> 28:32.055
so I'll go back and check
on their progress.

28:32.183 --> 28:34.720
I'm hashiguchi at fukushima minyu.

28:35.100 --> 28:38.467
Have you informed the nearby residents?

28:38.808 --> 28:42.426
We're working on it.
I'll go back and check on that, too.

28:43.433 --> 28:46.721
We regret causing
inconvenience to residents,

28:47.017 --> 28:51.260
but we'll follow the nuclear
regulation authority's directions.

28:51.850 --> 28:53.135
Oh, over here!

28:53.225 --> 28:54.840
We open

28:54.933 --> 28:58.050
the mo valve on the 2nd floor of unit 1 and

28:58.225 --> 29:00.466
the ao on top of the suppression chamber.

29:00.558 --> 29:04.471
Igawa and I will go in first
and open the mo valve.

29:05.225 --> 29:06.931
We'll open the ao.

29:07.767 --> 29:10.133
Mr. hirayama and matsuda wait here.

29:10.267 --> 29:11.302
- Got it.
- Yes.

29:11.392 --> 29:13.159
"1. Omori, igawa, 2. Kudo, yano,
3. Hirayama, matsuda"

29:13.183 --> 29:14.326
again,

29:14.350 --> 29:16.326
"14 hours 58 minutes after quake"

29:16.350 --> 29:18.826
residents within
a 10km radius of the plant must evacuate.

29:18.850 --> 29:20.135
"Tomioka town office"

29:20.183 --> 29:23.095
don't panic, everyone.
Please get on the bus.

29:23.725 --> 29:24.993
Again,

29:25.017 --> 29:26.576
"residents within a 10km radius
of the plant ordered to evacuate"

29:26.600 --> 29:29.512
residents must evacuate.
Please get on the bus.

29:29.683 --> 29:31.594
Please don't push.

29:31.683 --> 29:35.050
What's going on? Where
are we going this time?

29:35.308 --> 29:39.256
I'm not sure myself.
Just please get on for now.

29:39.350 --> 29:41.261
What about the radiation?

29:41.475 --> 29:44.592
What's happening at the plant? Tell us!

29:44.683 --> 29:48.926
I don't know!
Just get on the bus for now. Please.

29:50.100 --> 29:55.845
This is an emergency announcement
from tomioka town.

29:57.767 --> 30:00.964
The fukushima
daiichi nuclear power plant has...

30:01.308 --> 30:05.381
What are you doing, grandpa?
We have to hurry.

30:06.767 --> 30:07.973
Hurry.

30:08.683 --> 30:12.551
Keizo, big trouble over at daiichi, eh?

30:12.892 --> 30:16.180
We'll be able to come home soon.

30:16.308 --> 30:18.765
Toshio will handle it.

30:19.017 --> 30:20.803
Right. Let's go.

30:20.892 --> 30:22.132
Father.

30:24.725 --> 30:26.090
Ready?

30:26.642 --> 30:27.642
Go, haruka.

30:27.725 --> 30:28.840
Ok.

30:31.850 --> 30:33.386
Got everything we could find.

30:33.475 --> 30:34.715
Thanks.

30:36.517 --> 30:37.757
Thanks.

30:37.892 --> 30:39.473
Put them over there.

30:44.808 --> 30:46.469
We can go anytime.

30:47.142 --> 30:48.302
Ok.

30:53.517 --> 30:54.802
We're ready.

30:54.892 --> 30:56.007
Please wait.

30:56.100 --> 31:00.343
We still don't know
if all residents have evacuated. Wait.

31:00.683 --> 31:02.743
Mr. yoshida, may I have a word?

31:02.767 --> 31:03.951
"15 hours 4 minutes after quake"

31:03.975 --> 31:05.556
yoshida speaking.

31:05.642 --> 31:07.303
Can we vent now?

31:07.517 --> 31:10.099
The pm is headed that way.

31:11.767 --> 31:14.474
The pm? Now?

31:14.933 --> 31:17.174
Please handle it.

31:17.600 --> 31:21.138
Good god. Give us a break.

31:21.350 --> 31:23.557
We're stretched thin.

31:23.767 --> 31:27.464
It's been decided, so please handle it.

31:36.767 --> 31:38.473
Mr. yoshida.

31:40.308 --> 31:41.718
I understand.

31:41.808 --> 31:46.347
But hq should provide masks
for the pm's delegation.

31:46.558 --> 31:49.755
No, take care of that on your side.

31:49.933 --> 31:53.846
There aren't enough.
The workers are already sharing.

31:53.975 --> 31:56.136
We have no leeway.

31:56.225 --> 31:59.342
We don't either. You handle it.

31:59.433 --> 32:01.014
Damn you!

32:01.350 --> 32:03.011
Do you want us to die?

32:04.642 --> 32:06.849
Figure something out if you don't have any!

32:06.933 --> 32:09.595
We're too busy!

32:10.475 --> 32:14.388
Yoshida, follow orders for Christ's sake!

32:23.350 --> 32:28.640
So you want us to wait
until the pm leaves before venting, right?

32:34.642 --> 32:35.927
Why didn't you stop him?

32:36.017 --> 32:37.132
I did. No use.

32:37.225 --> 32:38.326
It's no joke if he's exposed.

32:38.350 --> 32:39.326
"15 hours 14 minutes after quake"

32:39.350 --> 32:40.590
make sure he's not.

32:40.725 --> 32:42.932
Yes, but who knows what'll happen...

32:43.058 --> 32:46.801
Please entrust me
with full authority during your absence.

32:47.892 --> 32:49.098
Very well.

32:56.267 --> 32:59.589
The biggest problem is decay heat.

32:59.683 --> 33:00.297
What?

33:00.392 --> 33:01.598
Decay heat!

33:02.600 --> 33:05.842
If we don't cool it with water,
the fuel will melt down.

33:06.058 --> 33:08.014
China syndrome.

33:08.600 --> 33:10.807
What happens if the fuel melts?

33:11.183 --> 33:15.096
Heated metal and water
will react and generate hydrogen.

33:15.183 --> 33:16.593
What's happening now?

33:16.808 --> 33:19.550
It's probably reached the vessel.

33:20.308 --> 33:23.141
If hydrogen is generated, it'll explode.

33:24.017 --> 33:27.635
That's why we have to hurry and vent.

33:27.850 --> 33:29.806
To let the pressure out.

33:37.142 --> 33:40.805
"Front gate,
fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant"

33:42.850 --> 33:43.826
thank you.

33:43.850 --> 33:45.076
"Japan ground self-defense force"

33:45.100 --> 33:47.682
jgsdf camp koriyama, 6th
artillery regiment.

33:47.767 --> 33:49.803
I'm sergeant major henmi.

33:49.933 --> 33:51.844
We've brought fire trucks.

33:51.933 --> 33:53.639
Please wait.

33:54.183 --> 33:56.469
But they're at the front gate!

33:56.600 --> 33:59.387
What? Why?

34:01.683 --> 34:03.264
I see.

34:08.475 --> 34:11.137
Sorry, we have to ask you to wait.

34:11.225 --> 34:12.635
The pm is here.

34:12.725 --> 34:13.760
Prime minister?

34:19.933 --> 34:23.175
"16 hours 25 minutes after quake"

34:30.433 --> 34:31.797
Good morning, sir.

34:32.016 --> 34:34.507
Why haven't you vented?

34:34.766 --> 34:37.007
Venting. Why haven't you done it?

34:37.100 --> 34:37.964
Well, that's...

34:38.058 --> 34:39.719
What's wrong with you?

34:41.766 --> 34:44.257
The air dose rate is very high.

34:44.350 --> 34:46.716
Decontaminate your gear,

34:46.808 --> 34:49.264
put it in a bag and hold on to it.

34:49.350 --> 34:52.592
Good morning. Remove your
shoes and hold them.

34:52.683 --> 34:54.422
The staff over there

34:54.516 --> 34:56.803
will test for contamination.

34:56.891 --> 34:59.008
Why do you think I'm here?

34:59.100 --> 35:01.011
I don't have time for this!

35:02.600 --> 35:03.680
But this is...

35:07.100 --> 35:09.261
Just your shoes, then.

35:09.350 --> 35:11.762
Wear these.

35:20.183 --> 35:21.889
What's the level?

35:22.100 --> 35:23.510
0.3msv.

35:24.392 --> 35:27.714
The unit 1 level is rising,
so move near unit 2.

35:28.475 --> 35:29.475
Hurry.

35:30.850 --> 35:32.636
What's going on?

35:32.725 --> 35:35.888
We're trying to vent without electricity

35:35.975 --> 35:38.887
and having some problems on site.

35:38.975 --> 35:40.431
What kind of problems?

35:40.517 --> 35:42.803
Let me explain.

35:43.183 --> 35:44.764
Please see here.

35:45.600 --> 35:48.797
This area was submerged
because of the Tsunami.

35:49.017 --> 35:52.680
Water came into the
building so we lost power.

35:52.975 --> 35:56.388
The core cooling system
is just barely working.

35:57.475 --> 35:58.840
What about the venting?

35:58.933 --> 36:00.594
We're working on it.

36:00.892 --> 36:04.464
But the valves won't open
without electricity,

36:04.600 --> 36:07.433
so we'll try to open them manually.

36:07.517 --> 36:09.223
Just make it happen asap.

36:09.350 --> 36:10.350
Certainly.

36:11.392 --> 36:13.804
We've assembled a suicide squad.

36:15.058 --> 36:16.343
A suicide squad?

36:22.433 --> 36:24.469
Is the pm still here?

36:24.558 --> 36:27.140
He's meeting with Mr. yoshida.

36:27.225 --> 36:29.011
Lift it up more!

36:31.183 --> 36:34.220
"Disaster relief"

36:53.642 --> 36:56.805
The water tank's beside this building.
Outlet's over there.

36:56.933 --> 36:58.173
Got it.

36:58.308 --> 37:01.266
Connect the trucks and start pumping.

37:01.350 --> 37:02.350
Go!

37:02.392 --> 37:03.222
Yes, sir!

37:03.308 --> 37:04.718
Run!

37:12.933 --> 37:14.093
Hurry!

37:14.183 --> 37:16.048
Watch your step!

37:19.225 --> 37:20.761
Hurry!

37:36.767 --> 37:38.451
All residents have evacuated.

37:38.475 --> 37:40.243
"18 hours 18 minutes after quake"

37:40.267 --> 37:42.427
"evacuation of all residents
in the vicinity confirmed"

37:47.558 --> 37:48.558
Yes?

37:48.642 --> 37:49.927
It's me.

37:50.392 --> 37:51.723
Sorry for the delay.

37:52.433 --> 37:54.094
Start venting.

37:54.183 --> 37:55.183
Got it.

37:55.642 --> 37:57.007
We have the order.

37:57.100 --> 37:58.510
Commence venting.

37:58.600 --> 37:59.760
Yes, sir.

38:00.058 --> 38:02.470
The survey meter Max is 1,000.

38:02.558 --> 38:04.514
If it hits 1,000,

38:04.600 --> 38:07.797
you have to come back right away.

38:08.100 --> 38:09.100
We know.

38:09.183 --> 38:13.631
I set all the alarms
on the dosimeters for 80msv.

38:13.892 --> 38:15.177
Whoa.

38:15.267 --> 38:18.054
Never seen that before. Serious stuff.

38:18.142 --> 38:20.007
The oxygen tank only lasts 20 minutes.

38:20.100 --> 38:21.590
That's enough.

38:21.808 --> 38:24.015
Don't overdo it, Mr. omori.

38:24.892 --> 38:26.473
I know.

38:40.975 --> 38:44.513
"Omori, igawa: 9:11 A.M."

38:44.600 --> 38:45.600
We're off.

38:45.642 --> 38:46.722
Thank you.

39:07.433 --> 39:09.094
Radiation level?

39:10.517 --> 39:12.929
600, so far so good.

39:38.017 --> 39:39.757
It's been 5 minutes.

39:48.433 --> 39:50.674
Cables connected to the power panel.

39:50.850 --> 39:53.216
We can start injecting if the pump works.

39:53.308 --> 39:54.343
Switching on the breaker.

39:54.433 --> 39:55.468
Yes, sir.

39:55.642 --> 39:58.224
3,2,1, 0!

39:59.308 --> 40:01.515
It's connected! It's connected!

40:05.767 --> 40:07.553
Ok, ok!

I see it!

40:11.725 --> 40:13.306
Oki

40:13.683 --> 40:15.594
- ready over here!
- Check!

40:15.933 --> 40:17.548
- Let's do it!
- Check!

40:17.642 --> 40:19.507
Commence injection!

40:19.808 --> 40:21.344
Commencing!

40:35.225 --> 40:37.011
It's here. Let's go.

40:47.225 --> 40:48.451
There it is. This is it.

40:49.933 --> 40:53.425

40:54.058 --> 40:56.549
This is the one. Let's go.

41:11.517 --> 41:12.757
11 minutes passed!

41:18.642 --> 41:20.052
Opening!

41:20.475 --> 41:22.636
Open it 25 percent!

41:34.642 --> 41:36.507
It's at 5 percent!

41:41.767 --> 41:43.098
10 percent!

41:53.892 --> 41:55.428

25 percent! It's open!

42:27.767 --> 42:29.507
It's open!

42:31.225 --> 42:33.307
Look, look!

42:35.267 --> 42:37.474
It's open 25 percent!

42:38.975 --> 42:40.556
It's open.

42:41.808 --> 42:43.764
We did it!

42:47.683 --> 42:52.928
Water's going in! It'll cool down now!
It'll cool down! Water's going in!

42:53.642 --> 42:55.132
Water's going in.

42:56.683 --> 42:58.219

43:09.850 --> 43:11.465
- Hey!
- Mr. 1zaki!

43:11.558 --> 43:13.674
- Mr. lzaki!
- No!

43:13.808 --> 43:15.298
Mr. lzaki!

43:15.433 --> 43:16.889
Wait!

43:17.933 --> 43:20.720
It's open! It moved, it's open!

43:21.475 --> 43:22.965
We did it!

43:23.100 --> 43:24.806
Yeah!

43:26.725 --> 43:30.215
Bring water!

43:30.558 --> 43:31.889
Yay!

43:33.600 --> 43:35.682
Great job!

43:37.892 --> 43:39.553
It was so hot.

43:42.058 --> 43:43.969
The mo valve is open!

43:44.183 --> 43:45.969
Oh! Yay!

43:48.558 --> 43:51.391
Please send in the second team.

Thank you.

44:19.017 --> 44:20.382
Hey, kudo.

44:20.767 --> 44:22.849
It's at the suppression chamber.

44:22.933 --> 44:25.094
Radiation levels are high. Good luck.

44:25.267 --> 44:26.507
Yes, sir!

44:42.433 --> 44:43.639
Ok.

44:44.267 --> 44:45.632
Let's do it.

44:45.975 --> 44:47.260
Let's go.

45:04.017 --> 45:07.159
"Reactor building,
first basement level torus room"

45:07.183 --> 45:08.389
it's hot.

45:19.225 --> 45:21.887
500. It's 500!

45:23.600 --> 45:25.136
Let's go.

45:44.058 --> 45:45.468
It's 900!

45:47.350 --> 45:50.842
We'll keep going until the Max.

45:55.058 --> 45:57.720
Hang in there. We're close.

46:09.433 --> 46:11.048
1,000msv.

46:12.475 --> 46:13.885
We can't go any further!

46:14.058 --> 46:16.674
30 more meters. Almost there.

46:16.767 --> 46:18.223
We can't!

46:18.392 --> 46:19.552
Come on!

46:19.892 --> 46:22.554
Mr. yano, we're going back!

46:23.058 --> 46:26.221
We can do this!

47:00.683 --> 47:01.968
They'll be ok.

47:05.392 --> 47:06.802
Thank you.

47:10.517 --> 47:12.098
- Mr. kudo!
- Mr. yano!

47:12.183 --> 47:13.673
What happened?

47:16.183 --> 47:17.764
We failed!

47:17.892 --> 47:21.180
The radiation was too high!
And we were so close!

47:21.267 --> 47:23.132
The meter hit the Max!

47:23.350 --> 47:26.012
I'm s 0 r ry! I'm s 0 r ry!

47:26.517 --> 47:27.848
This way!

47:27.975 --> 47:28.975
Bring water!

47:29.100 --> 47:31.307
Get their gear off!

47:31.808 --> 47:33.173
Excuse me.

47:33.475 --> 47:34.931
Mr. yano.

47:35.683 --> 47:37.173
Excuse me.

47:37.975 --> 47:39.385
Mr. lzaki!

47:40.017 --> 47:41.882
Their radiation doses...

47:42.183 --> 47:44.890
Are 89 and 95.

47:49.892 --> 47:52.725
That's nearly the emergency limit of 100!

47:54.100 --> 47:55.260
Thank you.

47:55.850 --> 47:58.808
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

47:59.517 --> 48:00.677
Mr. lzaki.

48:01.850 --> 48:03.556
Let me go again.

48:03.683 --> 48:05.344
No, Mr. yano.

48:05.600 --> 48:07.886
You were both highly exposed.

48:07.975 --> 48:10.682
You could've died if you'd stayed longer.

48:11.433 --> 48:14.505
Take them
to the seismic isolation building now.

48:15.433 --> 48:16.468
Yes, sir.

48:16.600 --> 48:18.261
I'm sorry.

48:18.767 --> 48:20.928
Let me go in!

48:21.017 --> 48:22.632
It's all right.

48:22.725 --> 48:24.590
I'm ss 0 rry!

48:25.017 --> 48:26.757
It's all right.

48:27.600 --> 48:28.600
So they couldn't...

48:28.683 --> 48:31.755
The radiation level is too high to go in.

48:32.725 --> 48:35.216
What if try opening the valve remotely

48:35.308 --> 48:37.515
by sending in air?

48:37.600 --> 48:39.306
Will that work?

48:40.350 --> 48:42.511
We have to try everything.

48:43.267 --> 48:44.267
Yes, sir.

48:47.017 --> 48:48.632
Mr. lzaki.

48:49.017 --> 48:50.473
Takumi! You came!

48:50.558 --> 48:53.265
Units 5 and 6 are stable now so we came.

48:53.350 --> 48:54.350
You too.

48:54.392 --> 48:55.302
Yes.

48:55.392 --> 48:57.883
Heard you're trying again.

48:59.933 --> 49:01.764
Suicide squad, right?

49:01.933 --> 49:04.845
The level is high here,
so how about a detour?

49:04.933 --> 49:08.630
Yes, it'll take longer
but should work if we hurry.

49:08.767 --> 49:11.349
Mr. hirayama, do you
know where the valve is?

49:11.433 --> 49:12.889
I'll manage.

49:12.975 --> 49:15.057
I know. I'll go.

49:15.142 --> 49:15.881
What?

49:15.975 --> 49:18.057
I worked at unit 1 for 10 years.

49:18.142 --> 49:20.633
I know everything

49:20.725 --> 49:22.681
about the ao valve.

49:22.767 --> 49:26.009
I understand unit 1's quirks the best.

49:26.808 --> 49:28.048
No.

49:28.725 --> 49:31.216
Do you get how deadly it is in there?

49:31.808 --> 49:34.140
Nobody younger than me should go in.

49:34.683 --> 49:38.596
I feel as though I was trained by unit 1.

49:38.683 --> 49:41.595
It made me what I am as a plant engineer.

49:41.683 --> 49:42.683
No!

49:44.100 --> 49:47.263
The reactors aren't just machines.

49:48.767 --> 49:52.806
Like kids, some are mischievous
and some are manageable.

49:53.017 --> 49:56.089
The most difficult one
here is unit 1, right?

49:56.225 --> 49:57.340
Exactly.

49:58.392 --> 50:01.805
I want to save it with my own hands.

50:02.808 --> 50:04.514
Please let me go!

50:06.267 --> 50:07.507
Get them changed.

50:07.600 --> 50:10.387
- Yes. Let's get to it.
- Ok, quickly.

50:11.350 --> 50:12.931
Let's hurry!

50:13.142 --> 50:15.804
They're from our high school.

50:16.392 --> 50:18.257
They can do it.

50:48.017 --> 50:49.427
Kana?

50:49.683 --> 50:50.968
Tomoko.

50:51.058 --> 50:52.514
Are you ok?

50:52.892 --> 50:54.223
Yes.

50:55.808 --> 50:58.140
Oh, I got these for you.

50:58.267 --> 51:00.758
Thank you. How nice.

51:02.683 --> 51:05.095
Have you spoken to takumi?

51:05.392 --> 51:06.552
No.

51:07.058 --> 51:09.265
I can't reach him on his phone.

51:10.225 --> 51:11.715
What about Mr. lzaki?

51:12.225 --> 51:15.058
Well, he should be ok...

51:15.308 --> 51:17.424
They're both pros.

51:20.183 --> 51:21.263
Yes.

51:26.308 --> 51:28.534
"Massive earthquake in east Japan"
"worst in history" "mega-Tsunami"

51:28.558 --> 51:30.674

51:30.808 --> 51:32.719
"Tomioka town evacuation center"

51:32.808 --> 51:34.639
quit smoking.

51:34.725 --> 51:36.340
Just one.

51:41.517 --> 51:46.216
The desk for missing persons
and safety confirmation is inside.

51:56.517 --> 51:59.475
"23 hours 44 minutes after quake"

51:59.975 --> 52:01.340
izaki speaking.

52:01.433 --> 52:03.424
Smoke's coming out from the stack!

52:04.100 --> 52:05.306
Smoke?

52:11.142 --> 52:12.427
Stop them!

52:12.600 --> 52:14.932
Something's happening! Stop them!

52:15.725 --> 52:16.635
A mask! A mask!

52:16.725 --> 52:18.511
Mr. kano! Mr. Honda!

52:26.475 --> 52:29.842
Hey, stop!

52:30.392 --> 52:31.882
Hey, stop!

52:33.100 --> 52:34.556
Stop!

52:35.933 --> 52:37.594
Why are you stopping us?

52:37.683 --> 52:39.924
We're going to open the valve!

52:40.683 --> 52:42.344
Just come back!

52:42.433 --> 52:43.718
Let go, damn it!

52:43.808 --> 52:45.844
It's an order!

52:45.933 --> 52:48.299
Abort the mission!

52:48.433 --> 52:49.923
Come back!

52:51.225 --> 52:53.386
Smoke from venting?

52:53.808 --> 52:55.173
We used the compressor

52:55.350 --> 52:59.013
to open the valve remotely.
Venting accomplished!

52:59.100 --> 53:02.672
Then tell us first! You
want to kill my men?

53:02.767 --> 53:03.847
We're risking our lives!

53:03.933 --> 53:08.472
I know that! We're racking
our brains over here too! Damn it!

53:09.350 --> 53:10.465
What happened?

53:10.558 --> 53:11.718
Venting accomplished.

53:11.808 --> 53:13.764
Sent in air with the compressor.

53:13.850 --> 53:15.181
So it worked.

53:16.142 --> 53:18.884
But I have mixed emotions.

53:19.017 --> 53:21.383
It spread radiation outside.

53:21.808 --> 53:24.345
I wonder if my mom evacuated.

53:26.558 --> 53:29.721
It's a lot better than
the vessel blowing up.

53:29.850 --> 53:32.842
Yeah, let's look on the bright side.

53:33.267 --> 53:35.258
You're right.

53:35.725 --> 53:39.217
The radiation level
inside unit 1 is higher now.

53:39.558 --> 53:41.970
It's impossible to go in.

53:42.058 --> 53:45.221
I wonder what's happening in the reactor?

53:45.767 --> 53:48.509
A meltdown has begun, probably.

53:48.683 --> 53:50.298
A meltdown...

53:50.600 --> 53:52.761
It's over if the vessel breaks.

54:06.933 --> 54:09.720
What's the point in us staying here?

54:12.058 --> 54:13.138
What do you mean?

54:14.475 --> 54:20.220
There's nothing we can do
in this situation. So why bother staying?

54:20.308 --> 54:24.005
Nishikawa!
And you consider yourself a plant engineer?

54:24.100 --> 54:28.218
The radiation level is getting higher
and we're in danger!

54:28.850 --> 54:32.217
Who'll protect this reactor if we run away?

54:32.308 --> 54:33.844
We're not. Instead of

54:33.933 --> 54:37.380
wasting time here, we retreat to
the seismic isolation building

54:37.475 --> 54:39.807
and return with some kind of plan...

54:39.892 --> 54:41.348
There must be a better way!

54:41.433 --> 54:44.391
We can't leave because
anything could happen!

54:44.475 --> 54:46.511
But we're dying for nothing!

54:46.600 --> 54:47.680
You...!

54:47.767 --> 54:48.927
How dare you!

54:49.100 --> 54:50.636
Hey, calm down!

54:50.933 --> 54:52.673
Stop, yamagishi!

54:53.392 --> 54:55.474
We'd be abandoning the
entire area of the plant

54:55.558 --> 54:58.595
if we retreat.

54:59.308 --> 55:00.308
Listen.

55:00.850 --> 55:03.967
The residents who evacuated

55:04.350 --> 55:07.842
left their homes in the hopes

55:08.017 --> 55:10.633
that we'd manage to bring
this under control.

55:10.892 --> 55:14.760
I was born here and raised here.

55:15.433 --> 55:17.799
I'll do anything to save it.

55:18.225 --> 55:22.013
You have family here. I do, too.

55:24.558 --> 55:27.800
We don't know what'll happen from now.

55:28.892 --> 55:32.589
But in the end, we're the last
ones to deal with it on-site.

55:35.058 --> 55:38.630
It's up to us to save our hometown.

55:39.600 --> 55:42.137
So I can't leave.

55:44.308 --> 55:48.722
I think it's worth staying
if only to monitor the meters.

55:49.600 --> 55:52.137
We can't give up on
controlling the reactor.

55:52.683 --> 55:57.347
No matter what Mr. yoshida says,
I'll make you evacuate first.

55:59.183 --> 56:00.798
Please understand.

56:03.892 --> 56:04.892
Please.

56:20.600 --> 56:23.137
"24 hours 50 minutes after quake"

56:30.142 --> 56:31.177
Masks!

56:31.267 --> 56:33.428
Put on masks! Masks!

56:35.308 --> 56:37.014
Masks!

56:37.225 --> 56:38.715
Check parameters!

56:39.683 --> 56:41.093
Hurry! Calm down!

56:51.642 --> 56:53.223
It exploded!

56:53.475 --> 56:55.090
It exploded!

56:56.600 --> 56:59.091
Explosion in unit 1!

57:04.433 --> 57:05.969
Retreat!

57:06.350 --> 57:07.806
Are you ok?

57:08.475 --> 57:09.681
Are you ok?

57:09.767 --> 57:12.383
You ok? I'll help. Can you stand?

57:12.475 --> 57:14.090
Let's get up.

57:17.975 --> 57:19.761
Not in here! Retreat!

57:19.892 --> 57:24.090
No, get out! Get out of here!

57:24.808 --> 57:26.639
Check the power cable!

57:31.767 --> 57:33.849
The power cable was damaged!

57:34.183 --> 57:35.183
What?

57:35.225 --> 57:39.798
We finally had some electricity
but now we have to start over.

57:42.142 --> 57:47.842
Breaking news. There has been
an explosion at fukushima daiichi.

57:47.975 --> 57:49.806
This footage is from today...

57:49.892 --> 57:52.133
What? What exploded?

57:52.558 --> 57:54.014
The containment vessel?

57:54.100 --> 57:55.590
I'll find out.

57:55.683 --> 57:59.255
The camera captured
smoke erupting from the plant.

57:59.933 --> 58:03.050
Details of the explosion are still unknown.

58:03.183 --> 58:05.048
What's going on?

58:06.017 --> 58:08.759
Hey, big trouble! The plant exploded!

58:10.767 --> 58:12.052
It's over.

58:12.142 --> 58:14.053
Nobody could've survived.

58:14.183 --> 58:15.468
They must all be dead.

58:15.558 --> 58:18.049
They shouldn't have built a plant there!

58:18.142 --> 58:19.222
What will happen?

58:19.308 --> 58:21.299
We'll never be able to go home.

58:21.392 --> 58:23.383
No way!

58:24.850 --> 58:25.850
Hey!

58:26.225 --> 58:29.638
Take down these curtains!
Nothing is celebratory!

58:29.808 --> 58:30.888
Hey, you!

58:31.767 --> 58:33.473
Take them down!

58:37.892 --> 58:39.223
Excuse us.

58:42.558 --> 58:45.220
You should take this off.

58:54.600 --> 58:56.056
Thank you.

59:08.308 --> 59:09.718
Mr. yoshida.

59:10.725 --> 59:12.966
We're almost out of fresh water.

59:14.517 --> 59:16.849
Then we have to inject seawater.

59:27.933 --> 59:30.640
Finally! Are you all right?

59:31.058 --> 59:32.423
I'm fine.

59:33.100 --> 59:34.840
How are things in aizu?

59:35.058 --> 59:36.923
We're fine over here.

59:39.267 --> 59:41.929
But what about your dad?

59:44.225 --> 59:47.137
That guy's probably doing fine.

59:49.350 --> 59:50.886
Haruka.

59:51.975 --> 59:53.636
I know.

59:57.475 --> 59:59.807
Dad! Dad!

59:59.933 --> 01:00:01.969
Watch your step.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.931
Cool down, haruka!

01:00:06.517 --> 01:00:09.714
I am cool. You're the one being emotional.

01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:11.556
You'll have a hard time.

01:00:11.642 --> 01:00:12.848
How do you know?

01:00:12.933 --> 01:00:14.343
I just do.

01:00:14.433 --> 01:00:17.345
He's 16 years older,
divorced and has a kid.

01:00:17.517 --> 01:00:18.677
It won't work out.

01:00:18.767 --> 01:00:22.259
Don't assume that. I'm
ok with it, so it's ok.

01:00:22.517 --> 01:00:23.552
I'm not ok with it!

01:00:23.725 --> 01:00:25.681
Huh? Don't be childish.

01:00:25.808 --> 01:00:28.550
I raised you for 24 years. What for?

01:00:28.808 --> 01:00:30.764
Give me one, dad.

01:00:31.017 --> 01:00:34.760
Letting you choose your path,
sending you to university...

01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:38.172
Tomoko, what have I worked so hard for?

01:00:39.058 --> 01:00:40.719
To give my only daughter away

01:00:40.892 --> 01:00:43.759
to some 40-year-old?

01:00:52.725 --> 01:00:55.683
I can't let you young ones stay anymore.

01:00:55.975 --> 01:00:57.886
Retreat immediately.

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:01.297
Don't worry, old guys are tough.

01:01:01.475 --> 01:01:03.807
We've lived half a century, after all.

01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:07.760
Let's go.

01:01:24.017 --> 01:01:27.305
This is our last moment. Let's take photos.

01:01:27.433 --> 01:01:30.049
Don't say stuff like that.

01:01:30.808 --> 01:01:34.721
Mr. kano first. Here goes. Say cheese.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.306
Mr. omori. You next.

01:01:39.642 --> 01:01:43.430
This could become my funeral photo,
so make me look good.

01:01:43.558 --> 01:01:46.345
A funeral photo in a full-faced mask?

Befits a plant operator.

01:01:50.808 --> 01:01:54.426
If we die, it'll be considered
"in the line of duty."

01:01:55.225 --> 01:02:00.265
"Die in the line of duty"?
Sounds cool, like a detective drama.

01:02:01.392 --> 01:02:03.303
Don't be ridiculous.

01:02:03.725 --> 01:02:07.092
Do you get what it means
to die from radiation exposure?

01:02:08.267 --> 01:02:11.134
Have you forgotten
the tokaimura nuclear accident?

"Accident at nuclear facility"

The cells all over your body die.
"Awful" isn't enough to describe it.

01:02:30.725 --> 01:02:32.181
Sorry.

01:02:32.642 --> 01:02:33.642
A group shot.

01:02:33.725 --> 01:02:35.056
Let's take one together.

01:02:35.183 --> 01:02:36.389
Hurry, hurry.

01:02:37.683 --> 01:02:41.130
Mr. matsumoto, you gained weight again!

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:55.006
Electricity generated here
will be sent to Tokyo.

01:02:56.308 --> 01:02:57.673
Cool, huh?

01:02:57.975 --> 01:03:00.659
You don't have to
work away from home anymore, dad?

01:03:00.683 --> 01:03:02.389
"Iwaki army airfield site"

01:03:02.517 --> 01:03:04.758
yeah. I'll work at
an affiliate company of the plant.

01:03:05.433 --> 01:03:07.719
Then you'll be home on new year's?

01:03:08.558 --> 01:03:10.469
Let's go to the shrine together.

01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:15.092
This is a nuclear containment unit.

01:03:15.183 --> 01:03:16.798
Big, isn't it?

01:03:16.975 --> 01:03:18.465
Wow.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.261
It's a boiling water reactor.

01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:23.012
The heat from fission reactions

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.965
boils water to produce steam,

01:03:25.058 --> 01:03:27.424
and that steam produces electricity.

01:03:27.975 --> 01:03:31.843
Nuclear power produces
massive energy at low cost.

01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:36.139
And it's clean energy
that doesn't emit carbon dioxide.

01:03:36.267 --> 01:03:39.555
It's the energy of the future.

01:03:40.975 --> 01:03:42.511
Wait, wait.

01:03:43.642 --> 01:03:45.007
Here goes!

01:03:51.767 --> 01:03:54.725
"27 hours 39 minutes after quake"

01:03:55.558 --> 01:04:00.177
"residents within a 20km radius
of the plant ordered to evacuate"

01:04:03.017 --> 01:04:05.133
close your window.

01:04:08.725 --> 01:04:11.637
"28 hours 39 minutes after quake"

01:04:16.183 --> 01:04:19.346
takemaru here. What's the status
of the seawater injection?

01:04:19.767 --> 01:04:21.223
We're doing it.

01:04:21.558 --> 01:04:23.423
What? Really?

01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:25.135
We're injecting it.

01:04:26.558 --> 01:04:28.674
You've already started?

01:04:28.767 --> 01:04:29.784
"Front of unit 3 building"

01:04:29.808 --> 01:04:31.093
what's the matter?

01:04:31.933 --> 01:04:33.548
That's not good.

01:04:33.808 --> 01:04:35.423
What do you mean?

01:04:35.642 --> 01:04:37.428
Just stop injecting!

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:40.967
Why? We can't stop now.

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:44.297
Oh, shut up!
The pm's office is complaining again.

01:04:44.642 --> 01:04:46.007
Pm's office?

01:04:46.392 --> 01:04:50.135
What are you saying?
Do you know what'll happen if we stop?

01:04:50.267 --> 01:04:51.803
Impurities.

01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:53.556
Huh?

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:58.423
They're saying impurities in seawater
may cause a recriticality accident.

01:04:59.433 --> 01:05:01.799
I've never heard of such a thing.

01:05:02.058 --> 01:05:03.969
Just stop doing it.

01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:05.840
The priority is to keep cooling it

01:05:05.933 --> 01:05:07.548
by any means available!

01:05:07.642 --> 01:05:09.803
Explain that to them!

01:05:09.892 --> 01:05:12.383
Yoshida, this is an order!

01:05:14.142 --> 01:05:15.803
We're not stopping.

01:05:16.683 --> 01:05:18.765
They want us to stop injecting?

01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:20.806
The government is butting in.

01:05:20.892 --> 01:05:23.884
Why is hq letting them?

01:05:24.308 --> 01:05:26.424
Laymen should shut up!

01:05:38.725 --> 01:05:39.510
Sasaki.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:40.600
Yes, sir.

01:05:41.475 --> 01:05:45.889
Hq might order us to
stop injecting seawater.

01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:54.715
Got that?

01:05:54.808 --> 01:05:55.968
Yes, sir.

01:06:03.808 --> 01:06:06.595
Good thing we had seawater in the pit.

01:06:06.683 --> 01:06:09.049
Yes, but I wonder how long it'll last.

01:06:09.142 --> 01:06:11.599
Hope we can keep injecting.

01:06:12.642 --> 01:06:14.849
Water is going into unit 1.

01:06:14.975 --> 01:06:16.260
Thank god!

01:06:16.475 --> 01:06:18.215
Great! Thank god.

01:06:18.350 --> 01:06:21.262
Report any problems
with water pressure or level.

01:06:22.683 --> 01:06:24.139
Mr. yoshida.

01:06:24.433 --> 01:06:25.297
Yes, sir.

01:06:25.392 --> 01:06:28.509
The pm's office is saying
it's too soon to inject seawater,

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:31.216
so please stop.

01:06:33.642 --> 01:06:34.927
Understood.

01:06:35.267 --> 01:06:36.473
Sasaki.

01:06:36.558 --> 01:06:37.673
Yes, sir!

01:06:38.308 --> 01:06:41.220
Stop injecting seawater. Abort mission.

01:06:41.308 --> 01:06:42.718
Yes, sir.

01:06:45.225 --> 01:06:46.431
Hq.

01:06:46.725 --> 01:06:48.807
I'm going to pee.

01:06:56.475 --> 01:06:59.382
Ok.

01:07:02.975 --> 01:07:05.057
Commencing injection!

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.056
Mr. mochizuki,

01:07:09.142 --> 01:07:12.009
it'll take at least 5 hours
for the power to recover.

01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:15.297
Injection is stable now, so we'll help.

01:07:15.392 --> 01:07:17.223
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

01:07:18.808 --> 01:07:20.548
Oh god, the smell!

01:07:20.642 --> 01:07:22.348
Sorry, sorry!

01:07:23.392 --> 01:07:28.091
Sorry for making you help
in the men's room, Ms. asano.

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:32.718
It's ok, someone's got to do it.

01:07:32.975 --> 01:07:35.637
But oh god, it smells!

01:07:36.558 --> 01:07:39.049
Water's not running.

01:07:42.183 --> 01:07:43.076
Igawa.

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:44.284
"49 hours 16 minutes after quake"

01:07:44.308 --> 01:07:46.765
is unit 2's rcic operating?

01:07:49.475 --> 01:07:51.841
Plus 3,750.

01:07:51.975 --> 01:07:54.057
The cooling system's working.

01:07:58.517 --> 01:07:59.222
Yes?

01:07:59.517 --> 01:08:03.931
Unit 3's radiation level is rising fast.
It might explode.

01:08:04.225 --> 01:08:07.058
Abort all outdoor missions.

01:08:07.183 --> 01:08:09.890
Everyone except those collecting data

01:08:09.975 --> 01:08:11.590
come to the seismic isolation building.

01:08:11.683 --> 01:08:14.095
We'll take turns in the control room.

01:08:14.433 --> 01:08:18.345
Izaki, you come back too
and report what's going on.

01:08:19.433 --> 01:08:21.549
I can't leave.

01:08:22.017 --> 01:08:25.009
You know what's going on the best.

01:08:25.392 --> 01:08:28.384
This is an order.

01:08:31.642 --> 01:08:36.180
- We'll stay here.
- Please go, Mr. lzaki.

01:08:37.642 --> 01:08:39.473
Mr. yoshida gave orders for

01:08:39.767 --> 01:08:43.385
5 men to take turns here from now on.

01:09:01.017 --> 01:09:02.506
Oh my god.

01:09:02.642 --> 01:09:04.678
It's like an air strike.

01:09:06.933 --> 01:09:08.844
The radiation level is rising!

01:09:08.933 --> 01:09:13.006
Stop working and evacuate
to the seismic isolation building!

01:09:13.808 --> 01:09:17.470
The radiation level is rising!
Evacuate quickly!

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:21.639
Evacuate quickly!
The radiation level is rising!

01:09:22.225 --> 01:09:24.511
Decontaminate over there.

01:09:27.058 --> 01:09:29.765
Radiation survey over here!

01:09:30.975 --> 01:09:33.091
Good work, everyone.

01:09:33.433 --> 01:09:36.265
Mr. lzaki, it must have been so hard.

01:09:36.433 --> 01:09:38.594
Thanks for your efforts, Ms. asano.

01:09:39.433 --> 01:09:41.765
You both haven't slept, have you?

01:09:41.850 --> 01:09:43.966
- We're fine.
- See?

01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:53.430
Mr. lzaki.

01:09:53.725 --> 01:09:55.261
Good work.

01:09:56.350 --> 01:09:59.592
Chief, 5 men stayed and 12 have returned.

01:10:01.225 --> 01:10:03.762
Mr. omori, thanks for your efforts.

01:10:04.017 --> 01:10:05.553
You too, Mr. hirayama.

01:10:05.642 --> 01:10:08.714
Good job. Rest up a bit, guys.

01:10:08.892 --> 01:10:10.223
Please.

01:10:10.892 --> 01:10:12.757
"64 hours 14 minutes after quake"

01:10:12.850 --> 01:10:13.885
Mr. yoshida.

01:10:14.683 --> 01:10:17.265
We have to get ready to vent unit 2,

01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:21.969
and have to pump water with the fire trucks
and work on restoring power.

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:25.137
Why not send workers back outside?

01:10:27.642 --> 01:10:31.214
We don't know when units
2 and 3 could explode.

01:10:31.808 --> 01:10:35.721
The pressure level
in the containment vessel is stabilizing.

01:10:35.808 --> 01:10:37.344
Resume working.

01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:41.342
What if we can't vent and
the vessel explodes?

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:43.136
It's all over.

01:10:44.058 --> 01:10:46.219
We've been sending you the data.

01:10:46.308 --> 01:10:48.720
The radiation levels are too high!

01:10:48.808 --> 01:10:51.675
You're lucky you can just say whatever.

01:10:52.142 --> 01:10:54.303
Stop talking back and do it!

01:10:55.683 --> 01:10:57.890
We'll take full responsibility.

01:10:57.975 --> 01:11:01.297
Then come see for yourself, dumb-ass!

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:11.635
Higuchi.

01:11:11.725 --> 01:11:12.725
Yes.

01:11:17.933 --> 01:11:19.343
I'm sorry.

01:11:20.683 --> 01:11:22.469
Could you go again?

01:11:24.267 --> 01:11:25.382
Yes, sir.

01:11:25.767 --> 01:11:26.767
Yes, sir.

01:11:27.267 --> 01:11:28.757
Set them up.

01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:32.797
Ok, everyone, let me explain over here.

01:12:17.017 --> 01:12:19.133
"68 hours 15 minutes after quake"

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.966
contact the control room and check!

01:12:23.225 --> 01:12:24.010
Anyone injured?

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:25.761
Check parameters!

01:12:26.558 --> 01:12:28.594
Hq! Hq!

01:12:28.725 --> 01:12:33.014
We have a situation!
It's unit 3! Unit 3 exploded!

01:12:33.892 --> 01:12:34.892
Anyone injured?

01:12:34.975 --> 01:12:36.260
We're checking now.

01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:40.764
Mr. yoshida! 40 people are missing!

01:12:46.475 --> 01:12:48.090
Get a stretcher!

01:12:48.558 --> 01:12:49.764
Are you ok?

01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:51.511
One injured over here!

01:12:51.642 --> 01:12:53.758
Bring a stretcher!

01:12:53.975 --> 01:12:55.090
Are you ok?

01:12:55.183 --> 01:12:56.719
Hurry!

01:12:57.142 --> 01:13:00.305
We're here to help! Hey, hurry!

01:13:06.225 --> 01:13:10.923
Make way!

01:13:20.267 --> 01:13:23.009
Mr. yoshida, what's going on?

01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:24.431
You said it was stable!

01:13:24.517 --> 01:13:25.552
We could have died!

01:13:25.642 --> 01:13:27.473
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:13:27.558 --> 01:13:31.050
It's too dangerous out there.

01:13:39.142 --> 01:13:40.632
You ok?

01:13:41.392 --> 01:13:43.974
I'll have to pay with
my life if anyone dies.

01:13:44.058 --> 01:13:46.891
Don't say that. Get a grip!

01:13:47.017 --> 01:13:48.473
I'm going to the control room.

01:13:48.558 --> 01:13:51.265
No, the radiation level
is too high out there.

01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:53.181
Wait a bit. Please.

01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:56.422
Unit 3 exploded
and radiation levels are higher.

01:13:56.517 --> 01:13:58.428
Wait a while, will you?

01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:02.342
Don't bother coming over.

01:14:02.725 --> 01:14:05.717
Maeda, it's just for now.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.216
It's really ok.

01:14:10.142 --> 01:14:11.348
It's ok.

01:14:12.058 --> 01:14:13.514
Takumi, I'm on my way!

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:15.306
I'm in charge over there!

01:14:15.392 --> 01:14:16.632
Mr. lzaki!

01:14:16.725 --> 01:14:17.725
Izaki!

01:14:17.767 --> 01:14:20.224
- No, wait!
- I can't!

01:14:20.308 --> 01:14:21.172
Izaki!

01:14:21.267 --> 01:14:22.882
Grab masks! Masks!

01:14:24.142 --> 01:14:26.053
You all stay.

01:15:07.475 --> 01:15:09.932
- It's our turn!
- Are you ok?

01:15:10.142 --> 01:15:11.723
We're here!

01:15:11.975 --> 01:15:13.135
It's our turn!

01:15:13.892 --> 01:15:15.757
- Mr. lzaki.
- Mr. lzaki.

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:21.182
You thought I'd abandon you?

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:26.012
- Igawa, we're here.
- Mr. omori!

01:15:26.933 --> 01:15:28.469
Matsuda.

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:33.010
Mr. kano.

01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.965
Sorry to worry you.

01:15:36.058 --> 01:15:38.549
Mr. izaki, I'm sorry.

01:15:40.267 --> 01:15:41.723
I'm sorry.

01:15:43.725 --> 01:15:45.215
I'm sorry.

01:15:51.183 --> 01:15:54.596
Mr. yoshida! We've confirmed
everyone's safety!

01:15:54.808 --> 01:15:59.097
Many were injured but no one died.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:03.885
I see.

01:16:05.517 --> 01:16:08.839
That's great. That's great.

01:16:12.517 --> 01:16:14.303
"81 hours after quake"

01:16:29.892 --> 01:16:34.340
Mr. izaki! The pressure level
in the unit 2 vessel is rising!

01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:36.010
Water level?

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:37.840
Below top of active fuel.

01:16:37.933 --> 01:16:39.343
Probably none left.

01:16:39.433 --> 01:16:40.889
It's not cooling!

01:16:40.975 --> 01:16:43.091
It's way over the limit.

01:16:44.475 --> 01:16:48.764
The pressure inside
the containment vessel is 730kpa.

01:16:50.767 --> 01:16:52.928
730kpa?

01:16:54.058 --> 01:16:56.595
That's twice the limit.

01:16:56.892 --> 01:16:58.428
This is bad.

01:16:58.683 --> 01:17:02.255
We'll try rewiring and
opening the sr valve.

01:17:02.683 --> 01:17:04.093
Battery.

01:17:09.142 --> 01:17:11.929
Do whatever to keep the
drywell intact. Please!

01:17:14.142 --> 01:17:16.383
If unit 2 explodes...

01:17:16.475 --> 01:17:19.672
Nobody will be able to approach this plant.

01:17:20.392 --> 01:17:23.384
We'll lose control of the reactors.

01:17:25.017 --> 01:17:28.464
The daini plant
will also be off-limits and eventually,

01:17:28.558 --> 01:17:30.594
it'll break down too.

01:17:32.475 --> 01:17:36.593
10 reactor explosions combined
means 10 times bigger than chernobyl.

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:40.951
"April 26, 1986:
Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster"

01:17:40.975 --> 01:17:42.368

01:17:42.392 --> 01:17:43.952
"within 30km radius forced to relocate"

01:17:44.225 --> 01:17:48.343
all of eastern Japan
including Tokyo will be destroyed.

01:18:01.475 --> 01:18:02.931
Mr. yoshida.

01:18:03.975 --> 01:18:05.681
Mr. yoshida.

01:18:06.183 --> 01:18:09.926
Just call out the unit 2 pressure
and water level from now.

01:18:15.642 --> 01:18:17.678
Drywell, 740.

01:18:18.058 --> 01:18:20.800
Reactor water level, downscale.

01:18:22.225 --> 01:18:24.557
It's going to explode.

01:18:24.683 --> 01:18:26.890
Yoshida, open the sr valve!

01:18:26.975 --> 01:18:28.840
Vent the drywell!

01:18:29.517 --> 01:18:31.678
We're trying!

01:18:36.183 --> 01:18:39.755
Mr. onodera, stop disturbing us.

01:18:40.183 --> 01:18:42.139
Yoshida, just hurry up!

01:19:05.142 --> 01:19:06.973
Everyone from cooperative companies,

01:19:07.683 --> 01:19:11.631
if you aren't currently
working on something directly,

01:19:12.225 --> 01:19:16.468
no need to stay here anymore.
Thank you for your support.

01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:20.012
You mean this place is in serious danger?

01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:22.216
Anything could happen at any time.

01:19:22.475 --> 01:19:25.433
Please evacuate immediately.

01:19:25.725 --> 01:19:29.047
We'll fight until the end.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.967
And the jsdf, thank you all very much, too.

01:19:36.850 --> 01:19:40.513
Mr. yoshida, we can't evacuate

01:19:40.808 --> 01:19:43.424
when private citizens are still fighting.

01:19:47.225 --> 01:19:51.138
Our job is to protect this country.

01:19:52.517 --> 01:19:54.007
My apologies.

01:19:54.767 --> 01:19:56.007
No.

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:06.548
Drywell, 745. Reactor
water level, downscale.

01:20:09.933 --> 01:20:13.846
They're going to die.

01:20:15.058 --> 01:20:18.380
Shouldn't we evacuate them all?

01:20:18.642 --> 01:20:19.802
Yoshida,

01:20:20.267 --> 01:20:23.555
please just hurry up and vent the drywell!

01:20:27.267 --> 01:20:29.553
Mr. fukuhara, you have a minute?

01:20:50.850 --> 01:20:53.011
Chief, are you ok?

01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:57.556
Mr. yoshida?

01:21:02.058 --> 01:21:03.468
Asano.

01:21:05.017 --> 01:21:07.383
Have you called your husband?

01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:09.340
No.

01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:14.806
Why?

01:21:15.642 --> 01:21:17.724
I don't have to.

01:21:18.183 --> 01:21:19.548
Why not?

01:21:21.058 --> 01:21:25.301
We're sort of connected with each other
even if we're apart.

01:21:29.558 --> 01:21:31.219
Are you bragging?

01:21:36.933 --> 01:21:38.159
Will you take responsibility?

01:21:38.183 --> 01:21:39.576

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:41.181
- Mr. takemaru!
- Give us an answer!

01:21:41.767 --> 01:21:45.965
Mr. takemaru! There are over
100,000 evacuees in fukushima!

01:21:46.058 --> 01:21:48.140
Will you take responsibility?

01:21:48.225 --> 01:21:50.682
Will you pay compensation?

01:21:50.933 --> 01:21:53.800
We'll do our best to handle it.

01:21:54.725 --> 01:21:57.216
This is fukushima minyu newpaper.

01:21:58.475 --> 01:22:02.172
What will happen to fukushima from now on?

01:22:04.392 --> 01:22:05.973
Tell us.

01:22:06.850 --> 01:22:09.341
Is there hope left for fukushima?

01:22:12.642 --> 01:22:14.303
Is there any hope...

01:22:15.475 --> 01:22:17.136
For fukushima?

01:22:24.517 --> 01:22:26.034
You're pulling out of fukushima daiichi?

01:22:26.058 --> 01:22:27.701
"85 hours 17 minutes after quake"

01:22:27.725 --> 01:22:29.076
pulling out? You're abandoning it?

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:30.556
No, we're not...

01:22:30.642 --> 01:22:31.927
Speak up!

01:22:32.058 --> 01:22:35.505
We're not considering pulling out.

01:22:37.017 --> 01:22:39.804
If they abandon daiichi,
radiation will spread.

01:22:39.933 --> 01:22:42.219
It'll be impossible to
reach the daini plant

01:22:42.308 --> 01:22:44.924
and all the reactors will break.

01:22:45.017 --> 01:22:46.507
We've made calculations.

01:22:46.725 --> 01:22:47.618
"Fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant,
250km radius"

01:22:47.642 --> 01:22:49.132
about 50 million residents within

01:22:49.225 --> 01:22:53.013
a 250km radius will be displaced.

01:22:54.308 --> 01:22:56.048
"Tokyo"

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:24.216

01:23:39.267 --> 01:23:40.848
Thank you for coming.

01:23:41.183 --> 01:23:42.639
This way please.

01:23:45.183 --> 01:23:47.743
The pm will join us
in the video conference shortly.

"87 hours 25 minutes after quake"

01:23:57.642 --> 01:23:59.803
Why are there so many here?

01:24:02.767 --> 01:24:05.053
There's no press here, right?

01:24:06.308 --> 01:24:10.347
You all know what's happening
at the plant and what it means.

01:24:11.975 --> 01:24:14.307
The damage will be devastating.

01:24:15.017 --> 01:24:17.474
This could be the end of Japan.

01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:20.716
You can't evacuate the plant!

01:24:21.392 --> 01:24:23.633
Save it at all cost!

01:24:24.058 --> 01:24:27.630
If you evacuate,
your company will surely go under.

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:30.932
You can't run away from this!

01:24:34.725 --> 01:24:36.716
What the hell is he saying?

01:24:36.892 --> 01:24:38.473
Nobody's running away.

01:24:38.558 --> 01:24:39.764
Damn you!

01:24:41.725 --> 01:24:45.047
Executives over 60 can go and die there!

01:24:45.433 --> 01:24:47.094
I'll go, too.

01:24:48.142 --> 01:24:51.555
Chairman and president,
get your acts together!

01:25:08.267 --> 01:25:10.553
You can't evacuate the plant!

01:25:15.683 --> 01:25:16.468
What the...

01:25:16.642 --> 01:25:17.973

01:25:22.017 --> 01:25:23.427
You ok?

01:25:23.975 --> 01:25:25.511
Check parameters!

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:27.056
We're on it!

01:25:27.767 --> 01:25:29.428
Batteries connected.

01:25:34.058 --> 01:25:37.971

01:25:39.808 --> 01:25:41.799

Unit 2 suppression chamber pressure, zero.

01:25:47.850 --> 01:25:50.762

01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:52.465
Verify it!

01:25:52.558 --> 01:25:54.014
Was that unit 27

01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:55.260
how's the containment vessel?

01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:57.511
A breach in the suppression chamber?

01:25:58.475 --> 01:26:01.763
An awful amount of radiation will leak.

If the suppression chamber goes down,
there's no way left to cool unit 2.

It's all over.

01:26:23.933 --> 01:26:25.423
Mr. lzaki.

01:26:31.892 --> 01:26:33.428
Listen up.

01:26:34.058 --> 01:26:39.098
Everybody except the essential personnel
in each team must leave.

01:26:39.558 --> 01:26:42.425
Team leaders choose the
members who'll stay.

01:26:42.975 --> 01:26:46.217
Thank you, everyone.

01:26:48.892 --> 01:26:51.850
We have protective clothing
and masks downstairs.

01:26:51.975 --> 01:26:54.512
Please make sure to put them on.

01:27:00.933 --> 01:27:03.675
You heard him. Leave now.

01:27:05.183 --> 01:27:06.514
I'm staying.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:08.090
So am I.

01:27:08.808 --> 01:27:11.345
What will you do, Mr. lzaki?

01:27:13.017 --> 01:27:14.632
Of course I'm staying.

01:27:14.725 --> 01:27:17.592
Then so will we. We'll see this through...

01:27:17.683 --> 01:27:19.264
Don't be ridiculous!

01:27:20.558 --> 01:27:22.674
You're still young. Go.

01:27:22.767 --> 01:27:24.132
We won't!

01:27:25.558 --> 01:27:27.765
This is an order! Get out!

01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:35.423
- Honda...
- You'll be needed for the future.

01:27:41.142 --> 01:27:44.930
Mr. lzaki. Thank you.

01:27:46.267 --> 01:27:48.007
You taught me so much.

01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:50.181
Thank you.

01:27:50.683 --> 01:27:55.928
Mr. lzaki, I'm sorry I
can't be of any help.

01:27:56.225 --> 01:27:57.761
I'm sorry.

01:27:58.058 --> 01:28:03.803
Not so fast. If I die,
you're going to replace me, Honda.

01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:11.300
And if you die, then yamagishi,
then komiya, then miyamoto will come.

01:28:12.142 --> 01:28:13.552
Got that?

Yes, sir.

01:37:33.183 --> 01:37:35.469
Reactor water level, downscale.

01:37:40.933 --> 01:37:43.390
Dumping water from a helicopter?

01:37:43.475 --> 01:37:44.885
Is that effective?

01:37:44.975 --> 01:37:46.931
If fuel rods are exposed,

01:37:47.017 --> 01:37:49.633
wouldn't the water cause a steam explosion?

01:37:49.892 --> 01:37:53.840
There is that risk.
And I don't know if it'll be effective.

01:37:54.017 --> 01:37:57.555
But it's necessary to show
Japan's will to the world.

01:37:58.058 --> 01:38:00.140
We have to try everything!

01:38:00.308 --> 01:38:01.514
"Releasing water."

01:38:08.683 --> 01:38:13.677
The jsdf has now begun
dropping water from helicopters.

01:38:13.808 --> 01:38:15.139
At 9 A.M. this morning...

01:38:15.225 --> 01:38:19.173
I appreciate the gesture,
but it's like cicada piss.

01:38:25.267 --> 01:38:27.679
Can be dumped on the reactor building.

01:38:27.892 --> 01:38:30.884
2 helicopters are currently on-site,

01:38:30.975 --> 01:38:34.467
and the air drops
are expected to continue. Again...

01:38:34.767 --> 01:38:36.177
Dad...

01:38:56.808 --> 01:38:59.049
Takumi, it's connected.

01:39:00.892 --> 01:39:02.223
I'll check.

01:39:17.975 --> 01:39:19.511
Mr. lzaki!

01:39:20.267 --> 01:39:24.306
It's gone down!
Pressure in the unit 2 vessel is down!

01:39:24.475 --> 01:39:25.715
How much is it?

01:39:25.850 --> 01:39:27.715
350kpa.

01:39:28.808 --> 01:39:31.220
- It's 350.
- It's gone down.

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:36.467
The containment vessel won't break now.

01:39:36.558 --> 01:39:37.843
Great.

01:39:38.183 --> 01:39:39.423
Thank god.

01:39:43.683 --> 01:39:47.050
The drywell pressure in unit 2 is down.

01:39:47.642 --> 01:39:49.098
Really?

01:39:49.642 --> 01:39:51.132
Thank god.

01:39:52.350 --> 01:39:53.760
Unit 2!

01:39:54.267 --> 01:39:56.553
The drywell pressure is down.

01:39:58.517 --> 01:40:01.930
The drywell pressure in unit 2
is down and stable!

01:40:04.142 --> 01:40:06.013
Prime minister!

01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:09.467
The containment vessel pressure
in unit 2 is down!

01:40:09.683 --> 01:40:12.345
The pressure in unit 2 is down!

01:40:16.017 --> 01:40:17.302
Mr. yoshida!

01:40:17.808 --> 01:40:22.177
A blowout panel on unit 2
has fallen and smoke is coming out!

01:40:24.767 --> 01:40:27.429
So that's why it didn't explode.

01:40:27.767 --> 01:40:31.430
But we've scattered radiation everywhere.

01:40:31.517 --> 01:40:33.803
That explosion was unit 4.

01:40:33.892 --> 01:40:36.053
I thought unit 4 was shut down.

01:40:36.142 --> 01:40:38.679
Maybe unit 3 had something to do with it.

01:40:38.767 --> 01:40:41.964
Unit 4's drywell is intact.

01:40:42.267 --> 01:40:43.552
I see...

01:40:44.433 --> 01:40:47.266
Stay alert, guys.

01:40:47.350 --> 01:40:50.387
Hold out a bit more
until the next crew arrives.

01:40:50.475 --> 01:40:51.760
Yes, sir!

01:41:17.475 --> 01:41:20.342
Good, stay that way!

01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:22.056
Yes!

01:41:22.683 --> 01:41:24.173
Great!

01:41:25.558 --> 01:41:27.173
It's a miracle.

01:41:28.142 --> 01:41:29.473
Yeah.

01:41:35.850 --> 01:41:38.057
I can see my wife now.

01:41:38.308 --> 01:41:41.220
We can go home alive, Mr. lzaki.

01:41:43.183 --> 01:41:45.344
Let's go home alive.

01:42:05.725 --> 01:42:07.681
Let's ask over there.

01:42:11.767 --> 01:42:13.678
I'm takumi maeda of tomioka town.

01:42:13.767 --> 01:42:15.803
Mr. maeda of tomioka town. Let me check.

01:42:15.892 --> 01:42:17.223
I'm lzaki of tomioka town.

01:42:17.308 --> 01:42:19.344
Mr. lzaki. Let me check.

01:42:19.433 --> 01:42:20.798
Dad?

01:42:23.683 --> 01:42:24.968
Haruka.

01:42:26.517 --> 01:42:28.007
Dad!

01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:36.592
You must have worried. I'm sorry.

01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:39.807
- Is everyone ok?
- Um.

01:42:41.517 --> 01:42:43.007
Mom!

01:42:44.850 --> 01:42:46.431
Mom.

01:42:49.517 --> 01:42:51.382
Dad's back.

01:42:51.517 --> 01:42:53.098
I'm back.

01:42:53.975 --> 01:42:55.556
Thank goodness.

01:42:55.808 --> 01:42:58.390
You scared us with that emoiji.

01:42:59.017 --> 01:43:00.017
Kana!

01:43:00.308 --> 01:43:01.308
Honey!

01:43:02.683 --> 01:43:04.139
Dad!

01:43:04.683 --> 01:43:07.140
Toru. It's ok now.

01:43:16.392 --> 01:43:19.509
Hey! Toshio!

01:43:19.808 --> 01:43:21.264
Mr. matsunaga.

01:43:22.142 --> 01:43:25.009
Toshio's back, everyone!

01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:26.590
Welcome back.

01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:28.761
That's great.

01:43:32.933 --> 01:43:34.139
Everyone.

01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:39.139
We've made tomioka town uninhabitable.

01:43:39.433 --> 01:43:41.765
I'm truly sorry.

01:43:44.558 --> 01:43:46.219
What are you saying?

01:43:46.308 --> 01:43:48.390
You did your best.

01:43:48.642 --> 01:43:52.430
You protected our hometown until the end.

01:43:52.808 --> 01:43:54.469
He's right.

01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:57.386
No need to apologize.

01:43:57.475 --> 01:44:00.717
Toshio, thank you for your hard work.

01:44:00.808 --> 01:44:02.139
Thank you.

01:44:08.058 --> 01:44:10.891
Grandpa! Grandpa!

01:44:11.725 --> 01:44:13.841
Dad's back.

01:44:19.517 --> 01:44:20.882
Dad.

01:44:28.475 --> 01:44:30.591
You're alive.

01:44:51.433 --> 01:44:55.346
"Spring 2014"

01:45:43.767 --> 01:45:46.179
- Permit, please.
- Good day.

01:45:48.850 --> 01:45:50.806
Ok, thank you.

01:45:51.475 --> 01:45:57.300

The electricity market
will become liberated from now on.

01:46:45.808 --> 01:46:48.515
Let's work hard together.

01:46:49.475 --> 01:46:51.215
Yes, sir.

01:46:51.558 --> 01:46:53.014
Welcome back!

01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:54.306
We've been waiting!

01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:55.806
Thanks.

01:46:56.975 --> 01:46:57.805
Ok, then.

01:46:57.892 --> 01:46:58.927
Yes, sir.

01:47:03.142 --> 01:47:05.053
Nice working with you again.

01:47:07.308 --> 01:47:08.764
I'm counting on you.

01:47:12.850 --> 01:47:14.135
Izaki.

01:47:15.058 --> 01:47:18.016
I may not be able to see you again,

01:47:18.392 --> 01:47:20.929
so I decided to write you this.

01:47:22.350 --> 01:47:26.639
It's already been 2 years
since the accident.

01:47:27.308 --> 01:47:29.784
We both had quite a rough experience.

01:47:29.808 --> 01:47:31.701
"From masao yoshida"

01:47:31.725 --> 01:47:34.432
I thought Japan was through.

01:47:34.725 --> 01:47:38.138
That the rest was up to god or Buddha.

01:47:38.267 --> 01:47:41.885
I accepted my fate,
that I was going to die there.

01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:46.262
If an accident happens,

01:47:46.392 --> 01:47:49.555
the first to die are the
people at the plant.

01:47:50.308 --> 01:47:55.223
But if we die,
the accident will go out of control.

01:47:56.308 --> 01:48:02.634
If we can't save employees, there's
no way we could save local residents.

01:48:05.058 --> 01:48:09.927
Remember when you asked
if we made a mistake?

01:48:10.933 --> 01:48:15.802
I think the answer to that question
is finally within reach.

01:48:17.058 --> 01:48:21.131
We disrespected nature's power.

01:48:21.808 --> 01:48:26.757
We believed that no Tsunami over 10m
would strike the plant.

01:48:27.433 --> 01:48:29.389
Without solid evidence,

01:48:29.475 --> 01:48:32.592
for over 40 years since daiichi was built.

01:48:33.517 --> 01:48:36.805
We believed we controlled nature.

01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:40.091
It was human ego.

01:48:41.517 --> 01:48:42.927
Izaki.

01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:45.451
I'm so glad you were there with me then.

01:48:45.475 --> 01:48:47.993
"On July 9, 2013, masao yoshida
passed away from esophageal cancer"

01:48:48.017 --> 01:48:52.215
had things gotten any worse,
I would have evacuated everyone

01:48:53.308 --> 01:48:56.220
and stayed until the end with you.

01:48:56.517 --> 01:49:01.341
I thought that you'd be
willing to die with me.

01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:07.090
Yoshi.

01:49:08.350 --> 01:49:10.887
Of course I wouldn't have left you.

01:49:12.808 --> 01:49:14.890
I would have stayed

01:49:15.433 --> 01:49:17.389
until the end with you.

01:49:20.517 --> 01:49:26.183
You know what? Nobody knows
why the containment vessel didn't explode

01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:29.682
even to this day.

01:49:32.308 --> 01:49:34.048
Something that terrible

01:49:35.308 --> 01:49:37.640
should never happen again.

01:49:41.183 --> 01:49:43.595
I promise, yoshi.

01:49:45.767 --> 01:49:48.474
We'll keep telling what happened

01:49:49.017 --> 01:49:51.804

01:49:52.892 --> 01:49:57.431
