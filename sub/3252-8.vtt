00:16.800 --> 00:19.800
Is there some sort of
fancy dress thing on this evening?

00:20.800 --> 00:23.750
I don't think so. Why do you ask?

00:23.800 --> 00:25.750
That fellow over there,

00:25.800 --> 00:27.750
dressed as a mummy monster thing.

00:27.800 --> 00:29.800
Who do you mean? I can't see him.

00:31.800 --> 00:32.800
You!

00:33.800 --> 00:36.750
You! Throw that man
out of my dining car.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.750
It's disgusting.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.750
I'm sorry, Madam. Which man?

00:40.800 --> 00:41.750
Which man?!

00:41.800 --> 00:43.750
I'll have your job.

00:43.800 --> 00:46.800
That man, right there,
dressed as a monster.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.750
Mama, there isn't anyone there.

00:50.800 --> 00:51.750
Are you feeling OK?

00:51.800 --> 00:53.750
Don't you dare lie to me, girl.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.800
I won't be made a fool of.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.750
Stop it. Stop it.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.750
Stop him at once. Right now.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.750
Mama, there's no-one there.

01:02.800 --> 01:03.750
You're worrying me.

01:03.800 --> 01:04.750
Do you want one of your pills?

01:04.800 --> 01:06.800
Oh, no! Get it off!

01:08.800 --> 01:09.800
Get it off!

01:11.800 --> 01:13.750
Is there a doctor?

01:13.800 --> 01:18.750
Sorry, I need a doctor! Sorry,
I don't know, she just stopped.

02:11.800 --> 02:12.800
Your train awaits, my lady.

02:15.800 --> 02:16.800
Wonderful.

02:18.800 --> 02:19.750
The baggage car.

02:19.800 --> 02:20.800
But thanks for lying.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.800
The real wonderful is through here.

02:28.800 --> 02:33.750
There were many trains to
take the name Orient Express

02:33.800 --> 02:34.800
but only one...

02:37.800 --> 02:39.750
..in space!

02:39.800 --> 02:41.750
BAND PLAY LOUNGE VERSION OF:
Don't Stop Me Now by Queen

02:41.800 --> 02:42.800
Of course it is.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.750
Completely faithful recreation
of the original Orient Express.

02:48.800 --> 02:49.750
Except slightly bigger.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.750
And in space.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.750
Oh, and the rails are
actually hyperspace ribbons.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.750
But, in every other respect,
identical.

It's a smile but you're sad.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.750

Gobbled up by that beast.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.750
And there's that smile again.
I don't even know how you do that.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.750
I really thought
I hated you, you know?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.750
Well, thank God
you kept THAT to yourself.

04:28.800 --> 04:32.750
There was this planet - Obsidian -
the planet of perpetual darkness.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.750
I did. I did hate you.
In fact, I hated you for weeks.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.750
Good, fine.
I'm glad that we cleared that up.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.750
There was also a planet that
was made completely of shrubs.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.750
I went to a concert once.
Can't remember who it was.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.750
Do you know what the singer said?

04:45.800 --> 04:48.750
Frankly, that would be an absolutely
astonishing guess if I did know.

04:48.800 --> 04:52.750
She said, "Hatred is
too strong an emotion to

04:52.800 --> 04:54.800
"waste on someone
that you don't like."

04:57.800 --> 05:00.750
Were people really confused? Cos
I'm confused. Did everybody leave?

05:00.800 --> 05:01.800
Sshhh! Shut up.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.800
Look, what I'm trying to say is...
I don't hate you.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.750
I could never hate you...

05:13.800 --> 05:17.800
but I can't do this any more.
Not the way... you do it.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.750
Can I talk about the planets now?

05:25.800 --> 05:26.800
Yes.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.750
Go!

05:30.800 --> 05:32.750
Thedion Four - constant acid rain.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.750
Had a lovely picnic there once,
wearing a gas mask.

05:34.800 --> 05:35.800
That's a lie.

05:38.800 --> 05:39.750
I'm sorry?

05:39.800 --> 05:41.750
That's a lie, what you said.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.750
Thedion Four was destroyed
thousands of years ago

05:44.800 --> 05:45.750
so you couldn't have been there.

05:45.800 --> 05:49.750
Miss Pitt, are you sure you
wouldn't rather rest in your room?

05:49.800 --> 05:50.800
That man's a liar.

05:52.800 --> 05:56.750
Perhaps you'd allow Mr Carlyle
here to escort you back.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.800
It'll be all right, miss.
Just come with me.

06:02.800 --> 06:06.800
Sorry about that. I suppose it's
understandable in the circumstances.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.750
I don't believe we've been
introduced. Captain Quell.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.750
I'm Clara. This is the Doctor.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.750
Ah, another one.

06:14.800 --> 06:15.750
Sorry? Another what?

06:15.800 --> 06:20.750
Oh, we've got doctors and professors
coming out of our ears on this trip.

06:20.800 --> 06:21.750
So, what are you a doctor of?

06:21.800 --> 06:24.750
Now, there's a question
that's never asked often enough.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.750
Let's say...

06:26.800 --> 06:28.750
intestinal parasites.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.800
I'm beginning to think
Miss Pitt was right about you.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.750
What's wrong with her?

06:36.800 --> 06:38.750
Did something happen?

06:38.800 --> 06:39.800
You mean you really don't know?

06:42.800 --> 06:44.750
There's a body AND there's a mummy.

06:44.800 --> 06:45.750
I mean, can you not
just get on a train?

06:45.800 --> 06:48.750
Did a wizard put a curse
on you about mini-breaks?

06:48.800 --> 06:50.750
Might be nothing.
Old ladies die all the time.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.750
It's practically their job
description. And the monster?

06:52.800 --> 06:56.750
Well, seen by no-one except her,
which suggests that it wasn't there.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.750
A dying brain, lack of oxygen,
hallucinations.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.750
Anyway, people do
just die sometimes.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.750
She WAS over 100 years old.
Says the 2,000-year-old man.

07:03.800 --> 07:08.750
Clara, you actually sound as if you
want this to BE a thing. Do you?

07:08.800 --> 07:09.750
No.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.750
No, look, fine. You know,

07:11.800 --> 07:14.750
if you think that there is nothing to
worry about, then that is fine by me.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.750
Are you sure? Ah, yes, I'm sure.

07:20.800 --> 07:21.800
To our last hurrah.

07:24.800 --> 07:28.750
Oh, last, yeah. I mean, it's not like
I'm never going to see you again.

07:28.800 --> 07:29.800
Isn't it?

07:31.800 --> 07:32.750
Is it?

07:32.800 --> 07:34.800
I thought that's what you wanted.

07:37.800 --> 07:40.750
No, I mean, you're going
to come round for dinner
or something, aren't you?

07:40.800 --> 07:44.750
Do you do that? Do you come
to people's houses for dinner?

07:44.800 --> 07:45.750
Of course. Why wouldn't I do that?

07:45.800 --> 07:48.750
I don't know. I thought
you might find it boring.

07:48.800 --> 07:49.800
Is it boring? No.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.800
To the last hurrah.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.800
The last hurrah.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.750
It's nothing. Nothing.

08:12.800 --> 08:13.750
Definitely sure.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.750
99% sure.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.750
Really? 99%? That's quite high.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.750
Is that the figure
you're sticking with?

08:21.800 --> 08:24.750
OK, OK. 75.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.750
Well, that's jumped quite a bit.

08:26.800 --> 08:27.800
You've just lost 24%.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.750
'A train in space. Sounds pretty
cool.' So, what are you saying?

08:32.799 --> 08:34.750
Just because he brought me
somewhere cool, I shouldn't dump him?

08:34.799 --> 08:37.750
Well, one, you can't dump him
because he's not your boyfriend

08:37.799 --> 08:41.750
'and two, dumping him sounds
a little scorched earth.'

08:41.799 --> 08:43.750
You still basically get on.

08:43.799 --> 08:48.750
I think you should just
enjoy your space train.

08:48.800 --> 08:49.800
At least it's not dangerous.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.750
Yeah.

08:54.800 --> 08:55.750
It's pretty...

08:55.800 --> 08:57.750
boring, really.

08:57.800 --> 09:01.750
Because you know what this sounds
like, don't you? No, do tell me.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.750
A mummy that only
the victim can see.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.750
I was being rhetorical.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.800
I know exactly what
this sounds like.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.800
(Doctor, are you awake?)

09:46.800 --> 09:49.750
Beautiful bit of kit, isn't it, sir?

09:49.800 --> 09:52.800
The Excelsior Life Extender.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.750
It's like driving around
in a portable hospital.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.750
Yes, well, it didn't do
Mrs Pitt much good, did it?

09:58.800 --> 10:00.750
Got me there, sir.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.800
Certainly got me there.

10:03.800 --> 10:04.750
Maybe it malfunctioned.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.750
Oh, I don't think so.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.750
The records show that
the machine did everything

10:08.800 --> 10:10.750
it could to keep her alive.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.800
Yeah. And almost drained
the battery doing it.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.800
What do you know?

10:17.800 --> 10:21.750
Well, I know that when I find
a man fiddling with a chair that

10:21.800 --> 10:26.750
someone died in, it's best to
play my cards close to my chest.

10:26.800 --> 10:27.750
Really?

10:27.800 --> 10:30.750
Well, I know that when I find
a man loitering near a chair that

10:30.800 --> 10:32.800
someone died in, I do just the same.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.750
Perkins.

10:37.800 --> 10:38.750
Chief Engineer.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.750
The Doctor.

10:40.800 --> 10:41.750
Nosey Parker.

10:43.800 --> 10:44.800
Pleased to meet you, Doctor.

10:45.800 --> 10:49.750
Course, there's
a rumour that someone...

10:49.800 --> 10:52.800
or some THING else
might be responsible.

10:58.800 --> 10:59.750
Hello?

10:59.800 --> 11:01.800
Are you OK?

11:04.800 --> 11:05.750
Hello?

11:05.800 --> 11:06.800
Excuse me?

11:08.800 --> 11:10.800
Excuse me?

11:11.800 --> 11:12.750
Miss Pitt, wasn't it?

11:12.800 --> 11:15.750
Are you all right?
Do you need some help?

11:15.800 --> 11:16.800
My name's Maisie. I'm not mad.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.750
Oh, OK. I didn't say you were.

11:20.800 --> 11:23.750
But you've had a bad day.
I think anybody could do with

11:23.800 --> 11:25.750
a little bit of help
after a day like today.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.750
Computer, open the door.

11:27.800 --> 11:28.750
'Call me Gus.

11:28.800 --> 11:32.800
'I'm afraid this door can only
be opened by executive order.'

11:34.800 --> 11:36.750
Are you OK?

11:38.800 --> 11:40.750
They won't let me see her body.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.750
They should let me see
her body, shouldn't they?

11:42.800 --> 11:45.750
Yeah, I should think so.
It's in there, is it?

11:45.800 --> 11:48.750
OK, I have a friend who's
really good with locks.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.750
Do you want to come with me,
see if we can find him?

11:50.800 --> 11:53.750
Oh!

11:53.800 --> 11:56.800
Or you could do that
because... that works, too.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.750
What's the most interesting
thing about the Foretold?

12:09.800 --> 12:11.750
I'm terribly sorry,
I don't believe we've met.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.750
You know, the Foretold,
mythical mummy.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.750
Legend has it that if you
see it, you're a dead man.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.750
Yes, I know what it is.
You see, I happen to be...

12:19.800 --> 12:21.750
Emil Moorhouse, professor
of alien mythology.

12:21.800 --> 12:22.750
I'm the Doctor. Pleased to meet you.

12:22.800 --> 12:26.750
So, the most interesting thing
about the Foretold - go!

12:26.800 --> 12:28.750
Ah... well, it would have
to be the time limit

12:28.800 --> 12:30.750
given before it kills you.

12:30.800 --> 12:33.750
I can't think of another
myth where it's so specific.

12:33.800 --> 12:34.750
How does it go?

12:34.800 --> 12:36.750
The number of evil twice over...

12:36.800 --> 12:39.750
They that bear
the Foretold's stare...

12:39.800 --> 12:41.750
have 66 seconds to live.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.750
No, no, no. Nice try.
Very atmospheric.

12:43.800 --> 12:44.750
But that's not it. Try again.

12:44.800 --> 12:48.800
A cynical man might say you that were
trying to pump me for information.

12:50.800 --> 12:54.750
The myth of the Foretold first
appeared over 5,000 years ago.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.750
In some stories, there
is a riddle or secret word

12:57.800 --> 12:59.750
that is supposed to make it stop.

12:59.800 --> 13:04.750
Some characters try to bargain
with it, offer riches, confess sins.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.800
All to no avail.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.750
Well, you certainly
know a little mythology.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.750
I know a lot.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.800
Because, from time to time,
it turns out to be true.

13:19.800 --> 13:20.750
What's that? What?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.750
What is that?

13:22.800 --> 13:25.800
But that's the great
appeal, isn't it?

13:26.800 --> 13:29.750
Earth legends are such
dry, dusty affairs,

13:29.800 --> 13:30.750
and always fiction.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.750
But up here, in the stars,
anything's possible.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.750
That's why I chose this
field, to be honest -

13:35.800 --> 13:39.750
hoping one day I might
meet a real monster.

13:39.800 --> 13:40.750
Isn't that
everyone's dream?

13:40.800 --> 13:42.750
But you still haven't
answered my riddle.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.750
What's the most interesting
thing about the Foretold?

13:45.800 --> 13:47.750
Well, you can't run from it,
that's for sure.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.750
There are accounts of people
trying but it never works.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.750
No matter how far you run,
it's always right behind you.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.750
There's nothing there!

13:53.800 --> 13:55.750
Can't you see it? Calm down.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.750
Get it away! Get it away!

13:57.800 --> 13:58.800
What's wrong with him?

13:59.800 --> 14:02.800
Get it away! No. Get it away!

14:07.800 --> 14:10.750
What is going on? Open the door.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.800
Open the door.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.750
Get out!

14:16.800 --> 14:17.800
Argh! He's unhinged!

14:24.800 --> 14:26.750
No! Stumpy!

14:26.800 --> 14:27.750
Nope. Even colder.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.750
All right, I give up, you tell me.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.750
Mrs Pitt, the old woman who died.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.750
She died of old age. Nothing
supernatural. No. That's my answer.

14:34.800 --> 14:38.750
Her death? No. The fact that
you were here to witness it.

14:38.800 --> 14:39.750
Excuse me, Professor.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.800
In which carriage?

14:45.800 --> 14:47.750
It was a heart attack.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.750
And if I hear anyone spreading
rumours to the contrary,

14:49.800 --> 14:51.750
they'll be getting off
at the next station,

14:51.800 --> 14:54.800
termination papers in hand.
Are we clear?

14:56.800 --> 14:57.750
Do you know what you're doing?

14:57.800 --> 14:58.750
Nope.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.750
But I do need to be slightly more
skilled than a high-heeled shoe.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.750
Do you ever wish...

15:07.800 --> 15:08.750
bad things on people?

15:08.800 --> 15:10.750
Oh, yeah. All the time.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.750
Whoever designed this door,
for a start.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.750
She wasn't really my mum.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.800
She just made me call her that.
She was my gran.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.800
Do you know why
I wanted to see her body?

15:24.800 --> 15:27.800
Because you... loved her
very much and were missing her?

15:28.800 --> 15:30.750
You obviously never met her.

15:30.800 --> 15:33.800
No, I just felt really guilty.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.750
Like I'd been picturing
her dying for years.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.750
Like a daydream.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.800
Not really meaning it.
At least, I don't think I did.

15:42.800 --> 15:46.800
But now, it just feels
like I made this happen.

15:50.800 --> 15:51.800
Hey, listen.

15:52.800 --> 15:55.750
You didn't do anything wrong.
Difficult people,

15:55.800 --> 15:57.750
they can make you feel...

15:57.800 --> 15:58.800
all sorts of things.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.750
But you didn't do it.
You didn't kill her.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.800
She just... died.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.800
Are you sure about that?

16:17.800 --> 16:19.750
I think we need to talk.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.750
This matter does not
concern the passengers.

16:21.800 --> 16:22.800
I'm not a passenger.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.800
I'm your worst nightmare.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.750
A mystery shopper. Oh, great(!)

16:30.800 --> 16:32.750
Really? That's your worst...?

16:32.800 --> 16:33.750
OK, I'm a mystery shopper.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.750
I could do with an extra pillow

16:35.800 --> 16:38.800
and I'm very disappointed with
your breakfast bar and...

16:39.800 --> 16:40.800
..all of the dying.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.750
This is not exactly
within your job description.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.750
Come on, Captain.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.750
Where would we all be if we all
followed our job descriptions? Mm?

16:51.800 --> 16:52.750
Good question. Glad you asked.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.750
In your case,
you'd be doing something

16:55.800 --> 16:56.750
instead of climbing inside a bottle.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.750
I have followed the procedure
for accidental death to the letter.

16:59.800 --> 17:00.750
Yes, I'm sure you have.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.750
And I'm sure you do just enough of
your job to avoid complaints.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.750
You don't know anything about me.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.750
Wounded in battle,
honourable discharge.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.750
And this is just a guess,

17:09.800 --> 17:11.750
but I think you've had
the fight knocked out of you.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.750
You expected this to be
a cushy desk job where you could

17:14.800 --> 17:17.750
put your head down until
retirement. Well, I'm sorry.

17:17.800 --> 17:18.750
As of today, that dream is over.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.750
There is no evidence of
any attack or other parties...

17:21.800 --> 17:22.750
Yes, let's just sit around

17:22.800 --> 17:25.750
and wait for the evidence
while the bodies pile up.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.750
Or here's a crazy thought -

17:27.800 --> 17:29.800
we could do something to stop it.

17:33.800 --> 17:34.800
Why am I even talking to you?

17:37.800 --> 17:41.750
Passenger manifest,
plan of the train and

17:41.800 --> 17:43.750
a list of stops
for the past six months.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.750
Quick work, Perkins.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.800
Maybe too quick.

17:48.800 --> 17:49.750
Yes, sir.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.800
I'm obviously the mummy.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.800
Or perhaps I was already
looking into this.

17:58.800 --> 18:03.750
This Doctor,
he's your what, exactly?

18:03.800 --> 18:04.800
He's not my anything.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.750
You mean you're just friends.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.750
Of course we're just friends.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.750
Well, not even friends, not any more.

18:13.800 --> 18:14.750
Well, that clearly isn't true.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.750
It's true. It is. It's very true.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.750
You do seem to be here together.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.750
Seriously? We're stuck in this
carriage, probably all night,

18:22.800 --> 18:25.750
and all we can talk about
is some man? Some man?

18:25.800 --> 18:26.800
Not that kind of...

18:30.800 --> 18:34.750
Look, we, um... We knocked about
together, we travelled

18:34.800 --> 18:36.750
and now we're stopping.

18:36.800 --> 18:42.800
This is a... I don't know,
goodbye to the good times.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.750
Were the good times all like this?

18:48.800 --> 18:51.750
Now that you mention it...

18:51.800 --> 18:56.800
'No! No! Get it out! Argh!'

18:58.800 --> 19:00.750
66 seconds. It fits the myth.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.750
Did you see the lights flicker?

19:02.800 --> 19:04.750
Mm. Yeah, the lights went
in the kitchen as well

19:04.800 --> 19:06.750
just before the chef saw it.
In all of the accounts,

19:06.800 --> 19:09.750
conventional weapons have
no effect on the Foretold.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.800
It's immortal, unstoppable...

19:12.800 --> 19:14.750
..un-killable.

19:14.800 --> 19:15.800
Can we get a new expert?

19:21.800 --> 19:24.750
He was wrong.
Yes. Yes. Yes, he was.

19:24.800 --> 19:28.750
And high-handed and thoughtless
and... and arrogant beyond belief.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.800
Exactly.
And you got on a train with him!

19:32.800 --> 19:34.750
I was saying goodbye.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.750
You can't end it on a slammed door.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.750
Yes, you can. Anyone can do it.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.800
People do it all the time.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.800
Except, of course, when they can't.

19:45.800 --> 19:49.750
Life would be so much simpler
if you liked the right people,

19:49.800 --> 19:50.800
people you're supposed to like.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.800
But then, I guess
there'd be no fairy tales.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.750
Doctor! Wake up, sleepy-head.
Time for breakfast.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.750
Knowing this train,
it'll taste amazing.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.750
Doctor, please, I'm in trouble.
Can't even get that right.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.750
Bad food on trains is traditional.
Doctor, please, just... Listen,

20:33.800 --> 20:34.750
there's been
another mummy murder.

20:34.800 --> 20:38.750
So our last hurrah just became
a bit more interesting. I'm trapped!

20:38.800 --> 20:39.750
What?

20:39.800 --> 20:41.800
Where are you?

20:45.800 --> 20:46.750
Clara!

20:48.800 --> 20:51.750
Is that you? Yes. Yes.
Hello. Can you hear us?

20:51.800 --> 20:52.800
Oh! Ow!

20:55.800 --> 20:57.750
Computer, can you
open the door, please?

20:57.800 --> 20:58.750
'Call me Gus.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.750
'I'm afraid this door can only
be opened by executive order.'

21:01.800 --> 21:04.750
Oh. Forget it.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.750
Now the stupid sonic
screwdriver's not working.

21:11.800 --> 21:12.750
What do you mean
it's not working? Why?

21:12.800 --> 21:15.750
I don't know. Some sort of
suppression field, I would guess.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.750
And it has to be a guess
because, as I say,

21:17.800 --> 21:19.750
the stupid sonic
screwdriver's not working.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.750
What are you even doing in there?

21:21.800 --> 21:23.750
I was looking for you,
Mr "Nothing To Worry About".

21:23.800 --> 21:26.750
What, was I supposed
to waken you up?

21:26.800 --> 21:28.750
Drag you out of bed
because I had a hunch?

21:28.800 --> 21:30.750
'I thought you didn't want
to do this any more.'

21:30.800 --> 21:32.750
Look, please, can we
just not do this now?

21:32.800 --> 21:34.750
I think we might
not be alone in here.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.750
(There's a sarcophagus.)

21:36.800 --> 21:38.750
Is it in there?

21:40.800 --> 21:43.750
I think we might just be
about to find out.

21:43.800 --> 21:47.800
Turns out the sonic is working,
just not on the door we need.

21:55.800 --> 21:56.800
Clara, it's coming.

22:04.800 --> 22:05.800
Doctor.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.800
Doctor, it's OK. It's
full of... bubble wrap.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.750
But the lights. Doctor,
move away from the door.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.750
My friend's inside.

22:18.800 --> 22:19.750
Then they're
in trouble, too.

22:19.800 --> 22:20.750
I spoke to head office.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.750
There is no
mystery shopper.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.750
You're not even
on the passenger list.

22:24.800 --> 22:27.750
Clara, I'm going to
have to call you back.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.750
I'm going to have to
mark you down for this.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.750
You are NOT
a mystery shopper.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.750
For all I know, you're the
one behind the killings.

22:34.800 --> 22:35.750
Oh, come on, Captain.

22:35.800 --> 22:38.750
How many people have to die before
you stop looking the other way?

22:38.800 --> 22:40.750
Get back!

22:42.800 --> 22:43.750
Stay back!

22:46.800 --> 22:49.750
What do you think
you're doing, man?

22:49.800 --> 22:50.750
Stop!

22:50.800 --> 22:53.750
Get up now!
That's an order!

23:06.800 --> 23:09.750
It turns out it's three.

23:09.800 --> 23:10.750
The amount of people that had to die

23:10.800 --> 23:12.750
before I stopped
looking the other way.

23:12.800 --> 23:13.800
Thank you.

23:14.800 --> 23:15.800
Same as the others?

23:25.800 --> 23:28.800
Ladies and gentlemen, could I
have a moment of your time, please?

23:30.800 --> 23:33.750
There's a monster on this train

23:33.800 --> 23:36.750
that can only be seen
by those about to die.

23:36.800 --> 23:39.750
If you DO see it, you will
have exactly 66 seconds left

23:39.800 --> 23:41.750
in which to live.

23:41.800 --> 23:44.750
But that isn't even
the strangest thing.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.750
Do you know what is?

23:46.800 --> 23:47.800
You.

23:49.800 --> 23:51.750
The passengers.

23:51.800 --> 23:57.750
Experts in alien biology,
mythology, physics.

23:57.800 --> 24:01.800
If I was putting together a team to
analyse this thing, I'd pick you.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.750
And I think somebody has.

24:05.800 --> 24:08.750
Someone of immense
power and influence

24:08.800 --> 24:09.800
has orchestrated this whole trip.

24:11.800 --> 24:13.750
Someone who I have no doubt

24:13.800 --> 24:15.800
is listening to us right now.

24:17.800 --> 24:20.750
So, are you going to step out
from behind the curtain

24:20.800 --> 24:23.750
and give us our orders?

24:23.800 --> 24:24.800
The engines. They've stopped.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.750
And the facade drops away

24:39.800 --> 24:43.800
because what use are a bunch
of scientists without a lab?

24:46.800 --> 24:47.800
Teleporter?

24:49.800 --> 24:50.750
No.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.750
Hard light holograms.

24:52.800 --> 24:53.750
They were never really here.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.750
Fake passengers
to make up the numbers.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.750
That was my best guard.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.750
'Good morning, everyone.

24:59.800 --> 25:03.750
'Around the room, you will find
a variety of scientific equipment.

25:03.800 --> 25:07.750
'Your goal is to ascertain
The Foretold's true nature,

25:07.800 --> 25:09.750
'probe for weaknesses
with a view to capture,

25:09.800 --> 25:13.750
'after which we will
reverse engineer its abilities.

25:13.800 --> 25:14.750
'Isn't this exciting?'

25:14.800 --> 25:18.750
You said "capture", implying that
you can't control this thing.

25:18.800 --> 25:20.750
And yet somehow you got
it on board. How?

25:20.800 --> 25:23.750
'There is an artefact,
an ancient scroll.

25:23.800 --> 25:26.750
'I have highlighted it
for your convenience.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.750
'For reasons currently unknown,

25:28.800 --> 25:32.750
'the Foretold appears in
the vicinity of this artefact.'

25:32.800 --> 25:33.750
And kills at regular intervals.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.750
Then just maybe we should
throw this thing out in the airlock.

25:36.800 --> 25:37.800
No! No! No!

25:41.800 --> 25:42.750
Looks like they've thought of that.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.750
What if we say no?

25:45.800 --> 25:46.750
Down tools.

25:46.800 --> 25:47.750
Refuse to work.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.750
'That IS your choice, of course.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.750
'But it would be very
upsetting were you all to die

25:52.800 --> 25:55.750
'at the hands of the Foretold.'

25:55.800 --> 25:57.750
So, hurry up before it kills you.

25:57.800 --> 25:58.750
But even if they agree to this,

25:58.800 --> 26:01.750
how are they supposed to study
a creature they can't even see?

26:01.800 --> 26:03.750
We don't even know
what the species is.

26:03.800 --> 26:04.750
Perkins, start the clock.

26:04.800 --> 26:07.750
Approximately 1.8 metres tall.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.750
Actually, seeing it
in the flesh isn't...

26:09.800 --> 26:12.750
nearly as rewarding
as I thought it might be.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.750
Oh, dear. Hard cheese.
What can you see? Details.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.750
Yes. Yes, of course. Of course.
Well, it just looks like...

26:16.800 --> 26:18.750
a man in bandages. I...

26:18.800 --> 26:21.750
What kind of bandages? Old? New?
Old. Whole? Ragged?

26:21.800 --> 26:22.750
Ragged. Falling off in places.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.750
I don't know what you
want me to tell you.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.750
Listen! You can see it. We can't.
Tell us what you can see.

26:26.800 --> 26:30.750
Even the smallest detail
might help save the next one.

26:30.800 --> 26:31.750
The next one?

26:31.800 --> 26:33.750
You mean... you can't save me?

26:33.800 --> 26:34.750
Well, that is implied, isn't it?

26:34.800 --> 26:37.750
Yes, this is probably
the end for you.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.750
But make it count! Details, please!

26:39.800 --> 26:42.750
Erm... flesh - some of it is
visible... 30 seconds. Leathery.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.750
Ancient looking.
Peat bog preserved.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.750
Keep talking!
Don't waste this chance!

26:46.800 --> 26:48.750
I want to bargain for my life.
W-w-w-what?

26:48.800 --> 26:50.750
Some of the myths say
if you find the right word,

26:50.800 --> 26:52.750
make the right offer, it lets you go.

26:52.800 --> 26:54.750
This is not a myth. This is real.
Forget your superstitions.

26:54.800 --> 26:55.750
Tell us what you can see!

26:55.800 --> 26:58.750
This is my life! My death!

26:58.800 --> 27:00.750
I'm going to fight
for it how I want!

27:00.800 --> 27:02.750
I give you... Ten seconds... my soul.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.750
I confess all sins.
I give you all my worldly goods.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.800
Only, please, please, please. No!

27:12.800 --> 27:13.750
Zero.

27:13.800 --> 27:17.750
'We apologise for any distress
you may have just experienced.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.750
'Grief counselling is
available on request.

27:20.800 --> 27:23.750
'On the bright side, I'm sure
you've all collected a lot of data.

27:23.800 --> 27:25.750
'Well done, everyone!'

27:25.800 --> 27:26.750
It's recording every death.

27:26.800 --> 27:28.750
Of course it is.

27:28.800 --> 27:31.800
That's what we're here -
to study our own demise.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.800
So, let's get to work.
Come on. Chop, chop.

27:43.800 --> 27:44.800
Clara Oswald.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.750
OK. So, first things first -

27:47.800 --> 27:50.750
The sarcophagus is actually
a secure stasis unit.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.750
Yes. It's where they want us to put
the Foretold if we capture it.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.750
That would have been good to know.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.750
Sorry. Teeny bit busy
round here. What else?

27:57.800 --> 28:00.750
'Please terminate your call
and return to work.'

28:00.800 --> 28:02.750
'We have some paperwork.'

28:02.800 --> 28:04.750
Passenger manifests
from other ships.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.750
Maisie recognised a couple of
the names. These are missing ships.

28:07.800 --> 28:09.800
'So, we're not the first.' No.

28:10.800 --> 28:14.750
'Please terminate your call
and return to work.'

28:14.800 --> 28:17.750
I've got some progress reports.
The Gloriana -

28:17.800 --> 28:19.750
spent three days getting
picked off by the Foretold.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.750
All died.
Performance marked as "poor".

28:22.800 --> 28:26.750
'Warning - decompression imminent.
Please vacate the area.'

28:29.800 --> 28:31.750
The Valiant Heart.

28:33.800 --> 28:37.750
42 crew, four died.
Performance - "promising".

28:37.800 --> 28:40.800
'Please terminate the call
and return to work.'

28:46.800 --> 28:47.800
I think you should do as it says.

28:56.800 --> 28:57.800
Clara, I have to go.

28:59.800 --> 29:03.750
'I'm sorry. I know that must
have been distressing for you.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.750
'But if you are disobedient again,

29:05.800 --> 29:07.750
'I will decompress another area

29:07.800 --> 29:10.800
'containing less
valuable passengers.'

29:11.800 --> 29:13.800
Less valuable passengers?

29:14.800 --> 29:15.800
How does it choose?

29:16.800 --> 29:19.750
Well, I'm assuming qualifications...

29:19.800 --> 29:21.800
No, no, no.
Not the computer, the Foretold.

29:23.800 --> 29:24.800
How does it choose who to kill?

29:25.800 --> 29:28.750
We've assumed it's random.
What if it's not?

29:28.800 --> 29:31.750
I want full histories
on all the victims.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.750
Medical, social, personal.

29:33.800 --> 29:35.750
'Well done.'

29:35.800 --> 29:36.800
Don't mention it.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.750
Doesn't seem to be any pattern.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.750
Their travel history,
interests, health -

29:47.800 --> 29:50.750
it's all over the shop.
Health? Are you sure?

29:50.800 --> 29:53.750
Mrs Pitt, the first victim.
She was over 100 years old,

29:53.800 --> 29:54.750
the frailest passenger on board.

29:54.800 --> 29:59.750
But the next to go, the chef,
was young and fit. It's random.

29:59.800 --> 30:00.800
The chef was ill.

30:02.800 --> 30:03.750
What?

30:03.800 --> 30:05.750
A rare blood disorder.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.750
Not contagious,
but we kept it quiet.

30:07.800 --> 30:09.750
Because he worked with food.
The next one - the guard?

30:09.800 --> 30:11.750
He wasn't ill as such,

30:11.800 --> 30:13.750
but he did have synthetic lungs
implanted last year.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.750
Professor Moorhouse.

30:15.800 --> 30:18.750
It seems he was physically
fine but suffering from...

30:18.800 --> 30:22.750
Here we are. "Regular panic attacks
after a car crash last year."

30:22.800 --> 30:25.750
It's picking off the weakest first.

30:25.800 --> 30:27.750
Sensing the illness somehow.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.750
The fake organs,
even psychological issues.

30:29.800 --> 30:33.750
This is good news because it means
we can work out who is next.

30:33.800 --> 30:36.750
I want the medical records
of everybody alive

30:36.800 --> 30:37.750
who is still on board.

30:37.800 --> 30:40.750
If anyone's had as much as
a cold, I want to know about it.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.750
You really think it can sense
psychological issues?

30:43.800 --> 30:45.800
Seems so. Why?

30:47.800 --> 30:49.750
When you said I'd lost
the stomach for a fight,

30:49.800 --> 30:52.750
I wasn't wounded in battle,
as such. But...

30:52.800 --> 30:57.800
my unit was bombed. I was the
sole survivor. Not a scratch on me.

30:59.800 --> 31:01.800
But post-traumatic stress...

31:02.800 --> 31:03.800
Nightmares.

31:06.800 --> 31:08.800
Still can't sleep without pills.

31:09.800 --> 31:13.750
Which means that
you are probably next.

31:13.800 --> 31:16.750
Which is good to know.
Well, not for me.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.750
Well, of course not for you
because you're going to die

31:18.800 --> 31:20.750
but I mean for us,
from a research point of view.

31:20.800 --> 31:23.800
You know, for a doctor,
your bedside manner...

31:26.800 --> 31:28.750
Well, there's goes our head start.

31:28.800 --> 31:29.750
Perkins, start the clock!

31:30.800 --> 31:32.750
What can you see?

31:32.800 --> 31:34.750
Almost feels...

31:34.800 --> 31:36.750
out of focus.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.750
Gives me a headache
just looking at it.

31:38.800 --> 31:39.750
No, no, no. That didn't work before.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.750
What kind of soldier would I be,

31:41.800 --> 31:42.750
dying with bullets in my gun?

31:45.800 --> 31:46.750
50 seconds.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.800
Someone shut that man up!

31:50.800 --> 31:52.750
For the record,
it didn't even flinch.

31:52.800 --> 31:53.750
Where is it now?

31:53.800 --> 31:56.750
Approximately 20 feet in
front of me and closing.

31:56.800 --> 31:57.750
40 seconds.

31:57.800 --> 31:58.800
Am I close?

31:59.800 --> 32:01.750
It's passing
right through you.

32:01.800 --> 32:02.750
Like a ghost.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.750
It's not a hologram.

32:04.800 --> 32:05.750
If you move,
will it follow?

32:05.800 --> 32:07.750
Do you want me to move?
I can certainly do that.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.750
Keep looking at it. But
back off quick as you like.

32:10.800 --> 32:11.800
It's teleported away.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.800
It's behind me.

32:16.800 --> 32:17.750
20 seconds.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.750
I think this is it.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.750
Still, suppose it's
not a bad way to go.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.750
Blood pumping,

32:23.800 --> 32:25.750
enemy at the gates
and all that.

32:25.800 --> 32:27.750
And thank you, Doctor,

32:27.800 --> 32:28.800
for waking me up.

32:29.800 --> 32:31.750
It's reaching for me.

32:31.800 --> 32:32.800
Hands... on my head.

32:36.800 --> 32:37.750
Zero.

32:37.800 --> 32:38.800
Ah!

32:40.800 --> 32:41.750
Teleporter - that means tech.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.750
Then 66 seconds - to do what?

32:43.800 --> 32:47.750
66 seconds. That seems very, very
specific. Too specific for organic.

32:47.800 --> 32:48.750
So, what? More tech?

32:48.800 --> 32:50.750
What? More? A countdown clock?
Something charging?

32:50.800 --> 32:53.750
A man just died in front of us.
Can we not just have a moment?

32:53.800 --> 32:56.750
No. No, no, no. We can't do that.
We can't mourn.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.750
People with guns to their heads,
they cannot mourn.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.750
We do not have time to mourn.

33:00.800 --> 33:04.750
Everybody, what takes
66 seconds to charge up

33:04.800 --> 33:06.800
or to change state? Anyone?

33:08.800 --> 33:11.750
Am I surrounded by idiots?

33:11.800 --> 33:12.750
If only I could see this thing!

33:12.800 --> 33:14.750
Don't even joke about that.

33:14.800 --> 33:15.750
I'm not joking about it.

33:15.800 --> 33:19.750
One minute with me
and this thing, it would be over!

33:19.800 --> 33:21.750
You know, Doctor, I can't tell

33:21.800 --> 33:24.750
if you're a genius
or just incredibly arrogant.

33:24.800 --> 33:25.800
Well, on a good day, I'm both.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.750
Ancient tech.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.750
This thing has been
around for centuries.

33:32.800 --> 33:33.750
How?

33:33.800 --> 33:36.750
Tech that keeps it alive.

33:36.800 --> 33:40.750
Tech that drains
energy... from the living.

33:40.800 --> 33:41.800
Scanner.

33:46.800 --> 33:47.800
Deep tissue scan.

33:49.800 --> 33:53.750
He's been leached of almost
all energy on a cellular level.

33:53.800 --> 33:55.750
The heart attack is just
a... is just a side effect.

33:55.800 --> 33:59.750
Oh, it's not just a mummy,
it's a vampire.

33:59.800 --> 34:00.750
Metaphorically speaking.

34:00.800 --> 34:02.750
But why take 66 seconds to drain us?

34:02.800 --> 34:04.750
Why not just pounce?

34:04.800 --> 34:05.750
Phase.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.750
Moving energy out of phase.

34:07.800 --> 34:08.750
That takes about
a minute, doesn't it?

34:08.800 --> 34:12.750
That's why only
the victims can see it.

34:12.800 --> 34:15.750
It takes them out of phase
so it can drain their energy.

34:15.800 --> 34:16.750
You, sir, are a genius!

34:16.800 --> 34:19.750
This explains everything.

34:19.800 --> 34:21.750
Apart from what it is
and how it's doing it.

34:21.800 --> 34:22.750
Sorry, I jumped the gun there

34:22.800 --> 34:25.750
with the "you're a genius, that
explains everything" remark. Doctor,

34:25.800 --> 34:28.750
I think we know the next victim.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.800
Ah, of course.

34:31.800 --> 34:33.800
That makes perfect sense.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.750
(She's had a bad day. That's all.)

34:38.800 --> 34:40.750
'Clara, it doesn't care.'

34:40.800 --> 34:42.750
Her bad day, her bereavement,

34:42.800 --> 34:45.750
her little breakdown puts
her squarely in its cross hairs.

34:45.800 --> 34:46.750
She's next.

34:46.800 --> 34:49.750
'Every simulation
we've run confirms it.'

34:49.800 --> 34:52.750
OK, but... but we're in here and, if
we stay in here, that thing can't...

34:52.800 --> 34:54.750
'This thing can teleport.'

34:54.800 --> 34:56.750
We need her here.
Even the computer agrees.

34:56.800 --> 35:00.750
OK, so you can save her? Right?

35:00.800 --> 35:02.750
Of course not.
Why would you think that?

35:02.800 --> 35:04.750
This is another chance
to observe it in action.

35:04.800 --> 35:05.750
As it kills her.

35:05.800 --> 35:08.750
'Of course, as it kills her.'

35:08.800 --> 35:11.750
If it happens in there,
it'll be a waste so bring her to us.

35:11.800 --> 35:15.750
How? How exactly?
She's never going to agree to this.

35:15.800 --> 35:18.750
Well, I don't know. Lie to her.
Tell her I can save her.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.800
Whatever it takes to get her here.

35:23.800 --> 35:24.800
What's he saying?

35:27.800 --> 35:28.800
He says...

35:35.800 --> 35:37.800
He says he can save you.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.750
I KNEW he could get us out of there.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.750
I told you, he's a good man.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.750
Yes.

35:45.800 --> 35:46.750
Yes, he is.

35:46.800 --> 35:49.750
And to be honest, I don't know
how convinced I am by this

35:49.800 --> 35:52.750
"trauma sense" thing, but if the
Doctor says he can help me anyway,

35:52.800 --> 35:55.800
that has to be a good thing,
doesn't it, Clara?

36:07.800 --> 36:09.800
Hello, again. I'm Maisie.
Good for you.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.750
We passed the TARDIS
on the way here.

36:12.800 --> 36:13.750
Thought about getting inside.

36:13.800 --> 36:16.750
Hiding. Or pulling levers
and hoping for the best.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.750
But we couldn't even get in.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.750
There was a force field around it.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.750
It's probably Gus trying
to block our escape route.

36:22.800 --> 36:24.750
How does he even know what it is?

36:24.800 --> 36:27.800
Cos if he knows what it is,
then he knows what you are.

36:28.800 --> 36:32.750
Well, he has tried to
entice me here before.

36:32.800 --> 36:35.750
Free tickets, mysterious summons,
he even phoned the TARDIS number.

36:35.800 --> 36:39.750
Do you know...? You knew. You
knew this was no relaxing break.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.750
You knew this was dangerous.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.750
I didn't KNOW. I certainly hoped.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.750
OK, this. You see, this.
This is why I'm leaving you. This.

36:47.800 --> 36:50.750
Because you lied. You lied to me,
again. And now you've made me lie.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.750
You've made me your... accomplice.

36:52.800 --> 36:56.800
What? Sorry?
When did you lie? Clara?

36:57.800 --> 37:00.800
Maisie, I am... I am so sorry.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.800
Do we start the clock? Not yet.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.750
Focus. Focus. Focus!

37:17.800 --> 37:20.750
All of that is your grief,

37:20.800 --> 37:22.750
your trauma,

37:22.800 --> 37:23.750
your resentment.

37:23.800 --> 37:26.750
And now it's mine.

37:28.800 --> 37:29.750
It's gone!

37:29.800 --> 37:32.750
No. No, it's not. Not for me.

37:32.800 --> 37:33.800
Cos now it thinks I'm you.

37:35.800 --> 37:36.800
Start the clock.

37:40.800 --> 37:41.750
Hello.

37:43.800 --> 37:45.750
I'm so pleased
to finally see you.

37:45.800 --> 37:48.750
I'm the Doctor and I will be
your victim this evening.

37:48.800 --> 37:49.800
Are you my mummy?

37:50.800 --> 37:53.750
But you can't hurt me
until my time is up. I think.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.750
So are there magic words?

37:55.800 --> 37:57.750
Is there a way to stop you
in your tracks?

37:57.800 --> 37:59.800
Oh, you really didn't
like your gran, did you?

38:01.800 --> 38:03.750
There's something visible
under the bandages.

38:03.800 --> 38:05.750
By the way, you weren't
being paranoid.

38:05.800 --> 38:07.750
She really did poison your pony. Oh!

38:07.800 --> 38:09.750
Markings like the ones the scroll.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.750
Oh, and your father. Sorry.

38:11.800 --> 38:13.750
A tattered piece of cloth
attached to a length of wood

38:13.800 --> 38:15.750
that you will kill for. 30 seconds.

38:15.800 --> 38:17.750
That doesn't sound like a scroll.
That sounds like...

38:17.800 --> 38:18.750
a flag!

38:18.800 --> 38:21.750
And if that sounds like a flag, if
this is a flag, that means that you

38:21.800 --> 38:23.750
are a soldier...

38:23.800 --> 38:27.750
wounded in a forgotten war
thousands of years ago.

38:27.800 --> 38:30.750
But they've worked on you,
haven't they, son?

38:30.800 --> 38:31.750
They've filled you full of kit.

38:31.800 --> 38:34.750
State-of-the-art phase camouflage,
personal teleporter.

38:34.800 --> 38:35.750
Ten seconds.

38:35.800 --> 38:36.750
And all that tech inside you,

38:36.800 --> 38:40.750
it just won't let you die, will it?
It won't let the war end.

38:40.800 --> 38:43.750
It just won't let you stop
until the war is over.

38:43.800 --> 38:44.750
We surrender.

38:44.800 --> 38:45.750
Zero.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.800
I can see it again.

38:48.800 --> 38:52.800
It's OK. I think we all can.

38:53.800 --> 38:54.750
Do I start the clock?

38:54.800 --> 38:55.800
No.

38:59.800 --> 39:01.800
The clock has stopped.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.800
You're relieved, soldier.

39:10.800 --> 39:11.800
He's not the only one.

39:13.800 --> 39:15.800
We were fighting that? So was he.

39:16.800 --> 39:17.750
Listen, what I said...

39:17.800 --> 39:20.750
Save it.
We're not out of the woods yet.

39:20.800 --> 39:24.750
Well, Gus, I think we
solved your little puzzle.

39:24.800 --> 39:28.750
Ancient soldier being driven
by malfunctioning tech.

39:28.800 --> 39:33.750
'Thank you so much for your efforts.
They are greatly appreciated.

39:33.800 --> 39:37.750
'Unfortunately, survivors of
this exercise are not required.'

39:37.800 --> 39:38.750
Ah, well, there's a shocker(!)

39:38.800 --> 39:41.800
'Air will now be removed
from the entire train.

39:43.800 --> 39:46.750
'We hope you have enjoyed your
journey on the Orient Express.'

39:46.800 --> 39:48.750
I take it you know a way out?

39:48.800 --> 39:50.750
My enemy's enemy is my friend.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.750
Especially when he has
a built-in teleporter.

39:52.800 --> 39:53.750
Great! So use it!

39:53.800 --> 39:56.750
A little more work. Doctor!

39:56.800 --> 39:58.750
Couple of minutes. Max.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.800
I'll give you a shout.

40:20.800 --> 40:22.750
Hello, again. Sleep well?

40:22.800 --> 40:24.750
Weren't we just on a train?

40:24.800 --> 40:25.800
Oh, that was ages ago.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.750
And...?

40:29.800 --> 40:31.750
And what?

40:31.800 --> 40:32.800
Oh, and we got off the train.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.750
The teleporter worked eventually.

40:36.800 --> 40:38.750
Beamed everyone into the TARDIS.
No casualties.

40:38.800 --> 40:41.750
Just a bevy of sleeping beauties.

40:41.800 --> 40:44.750
I tried hacking Gus from the TARDIS,
find out who set this all up.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.750
He really didn't like that.

40:46.800 --> 40:48.800
Set off some fail-safe thing.

40:49.800 --> 40:52.750
Blew up the train.

40:52.800 --> 40:53.750
Blew up the train?

40:53.800 --> 40:55.750
Blew up the train.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.750
But we got away.

40:57.800 --> 40:59.750
Then I dropped everyone off
at the nearest civilised planet,

40:59.800 --> 41:01.750
which happened to be here.

41:01.800 --> 41:03.800
You seemed happy asleep
so I just left you.

41:07.800 --> 41:08.800
So, you saved everyone?

41:11.800 --> 41:14.750
No, I just saved you
and I let everyone else suffocate.

41:14.800 --> 41:16.750
Ha-ha-ha.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.800
Yeah, this is just my cover story.

41:19.800 --> 41:23.750
So, when you lied to Maisie,
when you made me lie to Maisie...

41:23.800 --> 41:26.750
I couldn't risk Gus finding
out my plan and stopping me.

41:26.800 --> 41:28.800
So you were pretending...
to be heartless.

41:37.800 --> 41:40.750
Would you like to
think that about me?

41:40.800 --> 41:41.800
Would that make it easier?

41:43.800 --> 41:46.800
I didn't know if I could save her.

41:47.800 --> 41:50.750
I couldn't save Quell,
I couldn't save Moorhouse.

41:50.800 --> 41:53.800
There was a good chance
that she'd die too.

41:55.800 --> 41:57.750
At which point,

41:57.800 --> 41:59.800
I would have just...

42:00.800 --> 42:01.800
..moved onto the next...

42:03.800 --> 42:04.750
..and the next...

42:04.800 --> 42:05.800
until I beat it.

42:07.800 --> 42:11.750
Sometimes, the only choices
you have are bad ones.

42:11.800 --> 42:13.800
But you still have to choose.

42:24.800 --> 42:27.750
It's quite a vehicle
you have here, Doctor.

42:27.800 --> 42:30.750
I won't pretend to
understand half of it.

42:30.800 --> 42:31.750
Having said that,

42:31.800 --> 42:34.750
I did notice you've got a couple
of drive stacks need replacing.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.750
Oh, you did, did you?

42:36.800 --> 42:38.750
Yeah. You should get someone in.

42:38.800 --> 42:41.750
And a job like that takes for ever.

42:41.800 --> 42:42.750
Really?

42:42.800 --> 42:44.750
Well, I suppose,
whoever I did get in,

42:44.800 --> 42:48.750
it might just be easier to have
them stay on board for a while.

42:48.800 --> 42:51.800
I don't suppose
you'd know of anyone?

42:54.800 --> 42:56.750
No.

42:56.800 --> 42:58.800
Sorry, Doctor,
but I don't think I do.

42:59.800 --> 43:00.800
That job could...

43:02.800 --> 43:03.750
..change a man.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.800
Yes, it does. Frequently.

43:07.800 --> 43:10.750
Well, I won't keep you.
Goodbye, Perkins.

43:10.800 --> 43:12.750
Good to meet you.

43:12.800 --> 43:15.800
You too, Doctor. And good luck.

43:29.800 --> 43:30.800
Do you love it?

43:32.800 --> 43:33.800
Love what?

43:34.800 --> 43:37.750
I know it's scary and difficult

43:37.800 --> 43:40.750
but do you love being the man
making the impossible choice?

43:40.800 --> 43:41.750
Why would I?

43:41.800 --> 43:43.750
Because it's what you do.

43:43.800 --> 43:44.800
All day, every day.

43:45.800 --> 43:47.800
It's my life. Doesn't have to be.

43:50.800 --> 43:51.800
Is it like...

43:55.800 --> 43:56.800
Like what?

44:00.800 --> 44:01.750
..an addiction?

44:01.800 --> 44:03.750
You can't really tell
if something's an addiction

44:03.800 --> 44:06.750
till you try and give it up.

44:06.800 --> 44:07.800
And you never have.

44:09.800 --> 44:11.800
Let me know how it goes.

44:19.800 --> 44:22.750
Hey, Danny. How are you?

44:22.800 --> 44:23.800
'Fine.'

44:24.800 --> 44:25.800
So, is it done?

44:27.800 --> 44:29.750
Yep. Mission accomplished.

44:29.800 --> 44:32.800
Listen, I can't talk now
but I'll see you soon and, um...

44:34.800 --> 44:36.750
..I love you.

44:36.800 --> 44:37.800
'I love you, too.'

44:39.800 --> 44:42.750
No accounting for taste.

44:42.800 --> 44:43.800
'OK, see you soon.'

44:48.800 --> 44:50.800
Was that Danny? What did he want?

44:58.800 --> 44:59.800
He's fine with it.

45:01.800 --> 45:04.750
Sorry? Danny. He's fine with the
idea of me and you knocking about.

45:04.800 --> 45:07.750
It was his idea that we stop
but he's decided he doesn't mind

45:07.800 --> 45:08.750
and neither do I.

45:08.800 --> 45:10.750
Oh, to hell with the last hurrah,
let's keep going!

45:10.800 --> 45:12.750
That's a big change of heart.

45:12.800 --> 45:14.750
Yeah, they happen.

45:14.800 --> 45:15.750
Seriously?

45:15.800 --> 45:18.750
Look, as long as you get me home safe
and on time, everything is great.

45:18.800 --> 45:22.750
I am so sorry. I've had a wobble.
It's a big wobble but it's fine.

45:22.800 --> 45:24.750
Forget about it. Now, shut up
and give me some planets.

45:24.800 --> 45:26.750
Well, I'm glad that you said that

45:26.800 --> 45:28.750
because you know that one that's
made entirely of shrubs...?

45:28.800 --> 45:31.750
Are you sure about this? Are you?
Have you ever been sure?

45:31.800 --> 45:32.750
No.

45:32.800 --> 45:34.800
Then what are you waiting for?

45:37.800 --> 45:39.750
Let's go!

45:42.800 --> 45:44.750
Oh, that can't be good.

45:44.800 --> 45:47.750
Something nearby is leaching
all the external dimensions.

45:47.800 --> 45:50.750
Aliens. Possibly.
Oh, who am I kidding? Probably.

45:50.800 --> 45:52.750
Whatever they are,
they're experimenting,

45:52.800 --> 45:54.750
they're testing,
they are... they are dissecting.

45:54.800 --> 45:58.750
Trying to understand us, trying
to understand... Three dimensions.

45:58.800 --> 46:01.800
Life support failing.
