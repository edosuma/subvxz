You asked me why I had you.

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:17.160
You know, back in the village,

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:20.261
you just did what any man would do.

01:26:21.161 --> 01:26:24.360
You found a novia, got married,

01:26:26.161 --> 01:26:29.161
and then you headed north.

01:26:29.761 --> 01:26:33.061
And that's what I did,
'cause I didn't know any different.

01:26:35.862 --> 01:26:37.962
So we came here.

01:26:47.363 --> 01:26:48.663
Why?

01:26:50.563 --> 01:26:53.664
Because your mother and I loved each other
very much.

01:26:58.064 --> 01:27:00.064
But then, people change.

01:27:03.465 --> 01:27:06.164
And things were different here.

01:27:07.364 --> 01:27:08.865
Your mother changed.

01:27:08.965 --> 01:27:12.165
She wanted more than I could give her.

01:27:14.666 --> 01:27:17.166
So, she went away.

01:27:18.265 --> 01:27:20.866
And I was left alone with you.

01:27:21.466 --> 01:27:23.066
I didn't know how I was going to manage

01:27:23.166 --> 01:27:26.667
with a small boy,
with no money and no regular job.

01:27:28.966 --> 01:27:31.267
I had a lot of anger inside me.
