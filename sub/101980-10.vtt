01:12.781 --> 01:14.575
Mr. Turner.

01:14.658 --> 01:17.494
I understand you are looking for Jericho.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.329
Who are you?

01:19.955 --> 01:21.123
Aunt Josephine.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.545
Can you take this
and store it in a safe place?

01:26.628 --> 01:29.673
It's a gift for Leanne. Betamax player.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.343
What about May and Uncle George?

01:33.886 --> 01:35.971
They are not involved in this anymore.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.056
May I come inside?

01:40.517 --> 01:41.518
Wha--

01:44.563 --> 01:45.689
You can trust me.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.792
Dorothy Turner.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.086
The warrior.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.381
Who are you?

02:12.841 --> 02:13.926
Aunt Josephine.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.679
Aunt Josephine?

02:17.763 --> 02:19.223
Aunt Josephine.

02:22.518 --> 02:23.685
Where's Jericho?

02:24.728 --> 02:26.230
May we sit together?

02:27.731 --> 02:29.358
I want to be by your side.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.416
Have you done something to him?

02:46.959 --> 02:47.960
No.

02:50.963 --> 02:53.257
It must all be so confusing.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.341
Come.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.220
No person is meant to bear so much weight.

02:59.596 --> 03:00.848
What are you doing?

03:03.183 --> 03:04.268
Dorothy.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.688
You were never meant to be part of this.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.067
I know what you've done for your son.

03:13.986 --> 03:17.030
The length you have gone to get him back,
it's breathtaking.

03:19.241 --> 03:21.076
But it's time to end this, isn't it?

03:24.288 --> 03:26.874
You deserve a chance at peace.

03:27.666 --> 03:30.210
I don't understand why you're saying
these things to me.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.338
You don't mean them.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.133
If you did,
you would have brought him to me.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.219
I need an opportunity to see Leanne.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.348
She's in desperate need of my help.

03:43.432 --> 03:44.433
No.

03:46.143 --> 03:48.854
No, I won't let you up there
until my son is in my arms.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.650
Unfortunately, this is the order
in which it must be done.

03:55.027 --> 03:56.570
We have our customs.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.990
-Dorothy, maybe we should consider--
-No.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.075
I won't let you see her.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.288
I won't do this. Do you understand me?

04:07.331 --> 04:09.833
I don't want to play your games anymore.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.753
You have fought for so long, haven't you?

04:16.548 --> 04:17.548
You can let go.

04:19.426 --> 04:22.554
It's all going to be all right now.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.725
Dorothy, I think she's here to help us.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.529
You have 15 minutes with her and no more.

04:39.738 --> 04:42.783
And then you're telling me
everything I wanna know.

04:42.866 --> 04:45.953
And if you don't, I'll have you out of
here and you'll never see Leanne again,

04:46.036 --> 04:47.204
I swear to you.

04:50.582 --> 04:53.710
It's Jericho for Leanne.

04:54.878 --> 04:56.213
That's it.

04:58.674 --> 05:00.217
There's someone here to see you.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.468
Tell me who it is.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.512
She said she's your aunt.

05:03.595 --> 05:04.930
Tell me her name.

05:05.013 --> 05:08.141
She called herself Aunt Josephine.
They're right behind me.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.895
Please don't leave me alone with her.

05:22.406 --> 05:26.410
There she is. Our little Leanne.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.043
Why do you wear that veil?

05:36.336 --> 05:39.047
I would like to know
what you want, Leanne.

05:42.176 --> 05:45.345
I want to stay here with the Turners.

05:45.429 --> 05:47.055
I'm afraid that's not an option.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.725
-Why not?
-You don't belong here.

05:51.518 --> 05:52.519
Yes, I do.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.063
What do you believe?

05:56.940 --> 05:58.859
That you can be happy here?

06:00.944 --> 06:03.030
That this family loves you?

06:05.490 --> 06:06.575
They don't.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.599
Leanne and I are leaving tonight.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.608
I made you a promise that I want to keep.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.740
What is this?

06:50.619 --> 06:52.579
It's the truth, dear.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.688
Hey, Julian, something's happened.
I need you to call me back.

07:54.433 --> 07:55.434
Dorothy?

07:59.188 --> 08:00.772
What are you doing? Are you okay?

08:07.279 --> 08:08.363
Open the door.

08:09.907 --> 08:10.949
Dorothy.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.784
Fuck.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.176
What the hell?

08:46.151 --> 08:47.277
Dorothy!

08:51.865 --> 08:52.866
Dorothy!

08:56.286 --> 08:57.287
Dorothy!

09:09.633 --> 09:10.634
Is it prepared?

09:12.302 --> 09:13.303
Yes.

09:25.607 --> 09:26.608
What is it?

09:27.192 --> 09:29.653
Your final warning. So pay attention.

09:40.539 --> 09:43.709
Welcome, good people
of the Church of the Lesser Saints.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.295
They call me Uncle Frederick,

09:46.378 --> 09:49.590
and I will be guiding you
through your reunion ritual.

09:50.257 --> 09:54.678
We will show you how to return
a lost member back to the light.

09:55.554 --> 10:00.267
It requires practice,
planning and precision.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.102
The three P's.

10:04.021 --> 10:08.483
In order to help properly demonstrate,
young cousin Marian...

10:11.278 --> 10:12.696
will be giving me a hand.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.659
The ritual occurs in four steps.

10:17.743 --> 10:19.786
The first step is the invocation.

10:23.123 --> 10:26.293
See here our cousins in Lancaster
performing the invocation.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.133
We choose music that reminds us

10:33.217 --> 10:35.427
of a time on Earth
that was important to us.

10:35.511 --> 10:38.639
A time we fell in love,
a time something good happened...

10:39.306 --> 10:44.019
Then we hurt our flesh to separate
ourselves from this false feeling.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.358
Use any music you like.

10:50.651 --> 10:53.654
Whatever makes you feel connected
to your time on Earth here.

10:54.404 --> 10:57.157
The next step is the consecration.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.036
First, we blind them.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.789
This can be done with a knife,
hands or oil.

11:09.211 --> 11:13.006
The next part of the consecration
is to open up the flesh of the limbs.

11:13.966 --> 11:19.555
And once you have sliced each limb as such
with a heated blade,

11:20.430 --> 11:25.561
the soul is free to be released
from the body to be reunited with God.

11:30.399 --> 11:31.650
Dorothy!

11:43.412 --> 11:44.413
Dorothy!

11:59.303 --> 12:00.804
Only one step remains.

12:01.513 --> 12:02.681
The emancipation.

12:04.183 --> 12:06.977
You must burn the body
in a hand-prepared pyre.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.479
Ordinary branches and sticks
can be used as kindling.

12:12.900 --> 12:16.320
It's important to complete
these steps quickly and in order,

12:16.403 --> 12:18.363
otherwise the death may not take.

12:19.281 --> 12:23.744
It may be difficult
both physically and emotionally,

12:23.827 --> 12:27.331
but you must remind yourself
why this is necessary.

12:29.041 --> 12:31.210
Because when one of us goes bad...

12:32.544 --> 12:34.129
there is no turning back.

12:35.547 --> 12:39.676
By acting now,
you are saving innocent men and women.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.513
And although they may
have once been family,

12:42.596 --> 12:46.058
never forget who your adversary truly is.

12:50.312 --> 12:51.313
Good luck to you,

12:51.396 --> 12:53.649
and may God bless you with his strength.

13:02.866 --> 13:06.537
You made a decision to abandon
your charge and come to this family.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.165
I would like to know why.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.879
Dorothy needed my help.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.548
And have you helped her?

13:18.674 --> 13:19.675
Yes.

13:20.801 --> 13:24.680
But, Leanne, we are here for one purpose.

13:27.391 --> 13:30.352
To serve him.

13:34.398 --> 13:39.194
Come. Let's see if you can be saved.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.076
Dorothy!

14:09.725 --> 14:11.226
No.

14:11.310 --> 14:13.937
Oh, my God. Oh, no.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.606
Oh, no.

14:17.482 --> 14:18.650
No.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.283
Heavenly Father,
I have sinned against you.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.702
I ask you to forgive me.

14:28.785 --> 14:31.330
Come into my life
and cleanse me of my own belief.

14:31.413 --> 14:34.333
I give up my earthly possessions,

14:34.416 --> 14:37.503
and I open my heart to you, O Lord.

14:38.587 --> 14:43.634
I ask you to reign my body
for the purpose of your will.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.594
I give up my earthly possessions,

14:45.677 --> 14:47.971
and I open my heart to you, O Lord.

14:48.055 --> 14:51.266
I ask you to reign my body
for the purpose of your will.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.687
I will forget Dorothy Turner.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.029
Something wrong, Leanne?

15:08.242 --> 15:09.868
Why do I have to say that?

15:11.161 --> 15:13.705
We have to be prepared
to renounce everything.

15:15.499 --> 15:17.835
We have no room for attachments.

15:19.336 --> 15:20.420
Continue, Leanne.

15:22.464 --> 15:25.259
I will forget Dorothy Turner.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.932
I will forget Dorothy Turner.

15:34.810 --> 15:38.480
It is a sin to covet someone,
even a mother.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.525
You lost your way, Leanne.

17:04.608 --> 17:06.151
You must pay the price.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.877
O Heavenly-- O Heavenly Father--

17:48.610 --> 17:50.028
What the fuck?

17:57.369 --> 17:58.996
Dorothy, open the fucking door.

18:00.539 --> 18:02.624
I'm not coming out of this room.

18:02.708 --> 18:04.001
Why not?

18:04.960 --> 18:06.545
They've killed him, Sean.

18:08.881 --> 18:12.885
I'm getting... horrible feelings.

18:14.595 --> 18:15.888
I've made a decision.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.265
You don't know that.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.476
Trust me. You don't wanna do this.

18:24.521 --> 18:25.689
I want my baby.

18:26.481 --> 18:28.066
Then you need to open the door.

18:28.150 --> 18:30.068
Because then we can figure something out.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.446
But we need to be together to do that.

18:33.739 --> 18:36.950
I know you can't possibly understand
how a mother feels, Sean.

18:39.328 --> 18:40.787
We're the same soul.

18:42.623 --> 18:44.082
I need to be with him.

18:49.338 --> 18:52.299
But what about me? I need you.

18:53.509 --> 18:55.761
What do I do?
How do I breathe without you?

18:58.847 --> 19:00.349
I'm so sorry.

19:03.352 --> 19:05.312
I truly don't mean to hurt you.

19:06.188 --> 19:10.234
-I hope you can forgive me for this.
-I will never forgive you for this. Ever.

19:10.317 --> 19:11.818
I swear.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.448
It's too late.
I've already made the decision.

19:18.909 --> 19:21.745
And what am I supposed to tell him
if he's still alive?

19:21.828 --> 19:24.748
I'm supposed to tell him that you
left him motherless because of--

19:24.831 --> 19:25.999
Would you shut up?

19:26.083 --> 19:27.793
I can't do this
with you yelling out there.

19:27.876 --> 19:30.379
You won't do that to your son.
I know you won't.

20:44.953 --> 20:46.371
Heavenly Father,

20:46.455 --> 20:50.375
I will unite this child's soul
with her divine ruler.

20:50.459 --> 20:55.964
Save her from her own evil
and return her spirit to the light.

20:57.049 --> 20:58.884
You will burn like the rest.

21:01.970 --> 21:03.096
Jesus.

21:04.223 --> 21:05.891
Are you okay?

21:07.601 --> 21:10.979
Oh, Leanne. Leanne.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.401
Did she hurt you?

21:16.485 --> 21:18.695
No, I'm okay. I'm okay.

21:18.779 --> 21:21.240
Put pressure on it. Here.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.329
Sean, they're down here!

21:29.331 --> 21:30.666
Can you move?

21:31.625 --> 21:33.919
Calm down. Take deep breaths.

21:34.002 --> 21:35.212
Sean!

21:37.840 --> 21:39.800
I'm gonna go get him... for help.

21:40.467 --> 21:43.637
I'll be one minute.
And you call to me if you need me.

21:43.720 --> 21:44.721
I'll be right back.

21:45.430 --> 21:46.765
Dorothy.

21:49.852 --> 21:51.812
She wanted you to think he was gone.

21:53.730 --> 21:54.857
What?

21:56.108 --> 21:57.359
He's not gone.

21:59.736 --> 22:01.572
I'm gonna bring him back to you.

22:02.614 --> 22:03.824
Oh, Leanne.

22:05.576 --> 22:06.660
Thank you.

22:10.706 --> 22:12.291
I'll be right back.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.710
Sean!

22:18.881 --> 22:20.048
See?

22:22.050 --> 22:23.802
She protected me.

22:27.097 --> 22:28.640
Like I'm her daughter.

23:35.832 --> 23:38.752
Vanity is a sin, Aunt Josephine.

23:42.297 --> 23:45.509
Sean! They're inside.
I found them in the basement.

23:53.267 --> 23:55.894
We're getting him back, Sean.
She's agreed to it.

24:06.989 --> 24:08.365
She's gone to get him.

24:14.621 --> 24:15.873
You don't believe me.

24:17.332 --> 24:19.793
That's fine.
You didn't hear what she said.

24:21.628 --> 24:22.629
You'll see.

24:31.096 --> 24:32.097
Leanne?

24:33.140 --> 24:34.141
Leanne?

24:56.246 --> 24:57.539
Any minute now.

24:59.875 --> 25:02.127
Dorothy,
I don't think she's bringing him back.

25:03.420 --> 25:05.714
Have some faith in me, please.

25:06.632 --> 25:08.592
I'm not the weak thing you think I am.

25:15.891 --> 25:17.476
When you were in the nursery...

25:18.769 --> 25:23.315
and you said you had a bad feeling,
like maybe you knew something...

25:27.861 --> 25:29.363
Well, I was wrong.

25:30.906 --> 25:33.367
Remember last August
when I went to California

25:33.450 --> 25:34.952
and you were here alone for a week?

25:35.035 --> 25:37.996
Sean, why are you telling me
about a trip to California right now?

25:38.580 --> 25:40.958
Because something happened.

25:41.792 --> 25:46.630
But before I tell you that,
I want you to know that this is real,

25:46.713 --> 25:47.798
and I'm here--

25:47.881 --> 25:49.091
Sean, shut up.

25:49.174 --> 25:50.425
No, I have to tell you this.

25:50.509 --> 25:52.010
No, no, Sean, shut up.

25:57.432 --> 26:00.352
Row, row, row your boat

26:02.020 --> 26:04.064
Gently down the stream

26:06.525 --> 26:08.527
It's got to be someone else's signal.

26:09.528 --> 26:11.655
Life is but a dream

26:13.031 --> 26:18.328
The itsy-bitsy spider
Crawled up the waterspout

26:19.580 --> 26:25.252
Down came the rain and
Washed the spider out

26:25.335 --> 26:27.379
Out came the sun

26:27.462 --> 26:30.966
And dried up all the rain

26:31.884 --> 26:33.010
Leanne?

26:33.093 --> 26:36.180
The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the spout again

26:38.849 --> 26:39.850
You okay?

26:40.976 --> 26:47.441
London Bridge is falling down
Falling down, falling down

26:47.524 --> 26:48.567
What are you holding?

26:49.860 --> 26:53.280
London Bridge is falling down

26:53.989 --> 26:56.867
My fair lady

27:04.458 --> 27:07.544
Oh, my boy. Oh, my boy.

27:13.842 --> 27:14.843
Jericho.

27:17.554 --> 27:19.181
We're going to be a family now.

27:37.115 --> 27:39.660
I don't know why I keep doing bad things.

27:42.871 --> 27:44.706
Scare myself sometimes.

27:50.879 --> 27:54.091
I can feel the dark thing
in me getting bigger.

28:06.144 --> 28:11.525
But I'm tired of everyone
telling me what's wrong with me.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.320
Maybe there's nothing wrong.

28:17.573 --> 28:19.241
Maybe this is who I am.

28:24.538 --> 28:26.248
But I know how this works.

28:29.126 --> 28:30.836
I know they're coming for me.

28:34.715 --> 28:35.716
But don't worry.

28:39.052 --> 28:40.053
I'll be ready.

28:55.027 --> 28:58.572
I know killing you started a war.
