In the criminal justice system,

00:03.337 --> 00:05.073
sexually based offenses

00:05.106 --> 00:06.740
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.774 --> 00:09.143
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.177 --> 00:11.312
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.345 --> 00:13.381
are members of
an elite squad known as

00:13.414 --> 00:15.149
the Special Victims Unit.

00:15.183 --> 00:16.417
These are their stories.

00:20.321 --> 00:24.158
(man)
Every cop has a weakness.

00:24.192 --> 00:26.094
You just gotta know
how to exploit it.

00:26.127 --> 00:30.164
They think they're so smart.

00:30.198 --> 00:33.267
They treat you
like you're an imbecile.

00:33.301 --> 00:35.636
If you're not careful,

00:35.669 --> 00:38.072
you start to believe 'em.

00:38.106 --> 00:41.142
It's a game for 'em.
They get off on it.

00:41.175 --> 00:45.213
They got these huge egos.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.615
That's their biggest problem.

00:47.648 --> 00:52.620
All you gotta do is let 'em
know who's in charge.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.688
Not them.

00:54.722 --> 00:55.856
You.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.024
[switch clicks]

00:57.057 --> 01:01.462
They used to call FBI agents
gangsters with badges,

01:01.495 --> 01:03.131
one step away from being

01:03.164 --> 01:04.865
the worst criminals
in society.

01:04.898 --> 01:08.736
Stabler's like that.

01:08.769 --> 01:11.272
Big time.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.773
(man)
Who's Stabler?

01:12.806 --> 01:14.608
Jarhead detective.

01:14.642 --> 01:16.644
You know Stabler?

01:16.677 --> 01:18.446
I do.

01:18.479 --> 01:21.415
And he knows me too.

01:21.449 --> 01:26.354
He's been thinking about me
for a long time.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.389
He'll try to hang you
with your own words,

01:28.422 --> 01:29.423
catch you in a lie.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.125
You're dead
once that happens.

01:31.159 --> 01:32.260
What do you tell him?

01:32.293 --> 01:34.462
The truth'll set you free.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.464
Mr. Rickett,
let's get you set up

01:36.497 --> 01:39.800
in more hospitable
surroundings.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.769
[whistles]

01:41.802 --> 01:45.439
*

01:45.473 --> 01:47.441
(Detective Munch)
Okay, have a seat.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.610
Thought this would be
a little more comfortable.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.412
You all right there,
Mr. Rickett?
I'm fine.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.147
You sure you don't want
an attorney?

01:53.181 --> 01:54.248
I'm sure.

01:54.282 --> 01:55.649
Okay, we're gonna start
in a few minutes

01:55.683 --> 01:56.917
when the case detective
gets here.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.619
In the meantime,
you can relax.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.489
You want anything,
like a soda, coffee?

02:01.522 --> 02:02.823
Hey, you wanna look
at the Sports section?

02:02.856 --> 02:04.292
We might be here for a bit.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.327
I was never much
into sports.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.330
My high school basketball coach
said I looked like

02:09.363 --> 02:12.666
a retarded gazelle
with a spastic disorder.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.502
Mr. Daley.
Real loving guy.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.204
You look like you're
in pretty good shape.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.871
You work out, Mr. Rickett?

02:17.905 --> 02:19.673
I've been thinking about
getting a trainer myself.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.342
You know,
bulking up a little bit.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.344
I think it might help me
with the ladies.

02:23.377 --> 02:26.480
Is that why you work out?

02:26.514 --> 02:29.683
Ah, here we go.
Classifieds.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.719
"Single white male.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.721
"Wanted for my wife's
playmate.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.624
"Prefer hedonist who likes
pleasure mixed with pain.

02:36.657 --> 02:40.294
I get to watch."

02:40.328 --> 02:41.595
This could develop

02:41.629 --> 02:44.398
into something
really meaningful for you.

02:47.968 --> 02:48.869
Didn't somebody tell me

02:48.902 --> 02:51.305
that you lived in California
for a while?

02:51.339 --> 02:53.641
[light buzzes]

02:53.674 --> 02:55.576
You gotta be nuts
to come back to this city.

02:55.609 --> 02:58.846
In a few years
when I get my pension,

02:58.879 --> 03:00.147
meager though it is,

03:00.180 --> 03:02.450
I'm heading straight to the
beautiful San Fernando Valley,

03:02.483 --> 03:03.751
live the sweet life.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.853
I can't believe you came back.
Why did you?

03:05.886 --> 03:09.590
You have a girlfriend
in California, Mr. Rickett?

03:12.993 --> 03:14.562
I don't feel like chatting
anymore, friend.

03:14.595 --> 03:15.763
I hear ya.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.698
Might as well wait
'til we get started.

03:17.731 --> 03:20.501
Plus, it'll give you more time
to come up with an answer.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.703
Detective Olivia Benson.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.272
Gordon Rickett.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.406
Where's your partner?

03:25.439 --> 03:27.541
Just taking care
of a few things.

03:27.575 --> 03:28.842
We were just going over
the classifieds,

03:28.876 --> 03:30.978
trying to help out Mr. Rickett
with his sex life.

03:31.011 --> 03:32.513
He's very open-minded.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.982
You want something
to eat, Mr. Rickett?
I'm fine.

03:35.015 --> 03:38.486
He is so easy to please.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.921
Well, I see you're gonna have
a lot to talk about.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.923
Good night.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.707
We gonna start now?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.809
Just waiting for my partner.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.614
Your partner's
Detective Stabler?

04:06.647 --> 04:09.617
Want my advice?

04:09.650 --> 04:14.822
Get yourself a new partner.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.758
Tell you the truth,

04:17.791 --> 04:20.894
I'm surprised he's still got
a job with this outfit.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.997
Unless he's on medication
or something.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.637
Whack job.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.606
Total lack of control.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.576
Like an animal.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.811
You can tell him yourself
when he gets here.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.447
You think I'm an idiot?

04:39.480 --> 04:43.050
You think I don't know he's
right outside right now?

04:43.083 --> 04:45.986
What, are they afraid
to let you in here with me?

04:46.019 --> 04:49.857
Too unstable,
Detective Stabler?

04:49.890 --> 04:51.592
They got you
on a leash now?

04:51.625 --> 04:53.527
There's no one there.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.402
Come look for yourself.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.803
Forget it.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.577
I wish
she wouldn't do that.

05:09.610 --> 05:12.513
He wasn't coming out. Wouldn't
risk looking that stupid.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.382
Smart enough
to beat a murder wrap.

05:14.415 --> 05:15.483
Nothing to do
with brains.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.618
Rickett lucked out because
a jury wouldn't convict

05:17.651 --> 05:19.353
on the strongest
circumstantial evidence

05:19.387 --> 05:20.588
we could've given them.

05:20.621 --> 05:23.090
Well, he may
luck out again.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.626
No forensics, no weapon,

05:25.659 --> 05:26.827
no crime scene,

05:26.860 --> 05:31.365
and no idea how he transported
the body to the dump site.

05:31.399 --> 05:34.067
I'm aware
of this, Captain.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.936
How long since you
arrested him?

05:35.969 --> 05:37.070
Three hours.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.906
Then you got 21 more
'til he walks.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.374
He was packing up
his apartment.

05:40.408 --> 05:41.208
If I hadn't collared him,

05:41.241 --> 05:42.576
in a couple hours
he would've skipped

05:42.610 --> 05:45.879
and gotten away
with another one.

05:45.913 --> 05:48.148
Not this time.

05:48.181 --> 05:52.620
He really wants you in there.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.422
I'm gonna make him
beg for it.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.447
(Rickett)
This is harassment, you know.

06:55.616 --> 07:00.020
I never touched that girl.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.856
I know my rights.

07:02.890 --> 07:06.760
You can't drum this up
after 14 years.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.161
The jury found me
innocent.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.598
You're not here about
Dana MacNamara, Mr. Rickett.

07:10.631 --> 07:11.932
Then what are the boxes for?

07:11.965 --> 07:15.569
When the interview begins,

07:15.603 --> 07:16.737
you're gonna answer
our questions.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.640
See, that's the way it works
around here, Mr. Rickett.

07:19.673 --> 07:20.708
In case you've forgotten.

07:20.741 --> 07:21.742
I don't have
to answer anything.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.744
I don't have
to say a word.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.579
That's true.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.581
You know what
they said about me?

07:27.615 --> 07:29.216
Do you know what
that trial did to my life?

07:29.249 --> 07:30.684
That was before my time.

07:30.718 --> 07:31.985
Oh, really?

07:32.019 --> 07:33.020
You don't know?

07:33.053 --> 07:36.590
You never heard
anything about it?

07:36.624 --> 07:39.493
Then why even bring it up?

07:42.295 --> 07:44.965
Come on.
Hmm?

07:55.676 --> 07:59.580
Let's get this over with.

07:59.613 --> 08:02.650
Why'd you leave California,
Mr. Rickett?

08:02.683 --> 08:04.752
I didn't like it.
Why not?

08:04.785 --> 08:07.020
It was too hot.

08:07.054 --> 08:10.123
Tell me
about Dana MacNamara.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.124
No.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.125
Thought you wanted

08:12.159 --> 08:13.193
to get this over with.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.928
I don't want
to talk about that.

08:14.962 --> 08:18.699
This is a frame job.

08:18.732 --> 08:19.967
I'm not stupid.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.569
Oh, nobody's calling

08:21.602 --> 08:22.570
you stupid, Mr. Rickett.

08:22.603 --> 08:23.671
In fact, I believe that

08:23.704 --> 08:26.139
that was Detective Stabler's
mistake 14 years ago--

08:26.173 --> 08:28.876
Not respecting your intelligence
the first time around.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.144
There was no
first time around.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.581
Dana MacNamara.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.182
11 years old.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.785
Last seen
on January 10th, 1991.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.620
3:30 in the afternoon.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.622
Witnesses say that she was
walking up the street

08:41.655 --> 08:44.725
with you.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.193
She also lived
in your building.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.060
Not true.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.730
She lived in the apartment
above my bar,

08:49.763 --> 08:51.699
where lots of people
come and go,

08:51.732 --> 08:54.267
lots of suspects
that you guys never talked to.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.903
Police questioned
Vanessa Serafino,

08:55.936 --> 08:58.706
your fiancÃ©e at the time.

08:58.739 --> 08:59.840
Now, Miss Serafino

08:59.873 --> 09:02.576
stated, and later testified
at trial,

09:02.610 --> 09:04.845
that you were prone
to violent outbursts.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.213
She's a liar.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.081
And whenever you had
sexual relations with her,

09:08.115 --> 09:09.349
you made her wear pigtails,

09:09.382 --> 09:11.919
because it made her
look younger.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.721
And although she complied
with your request,

09:13.754 --> 09:17.658
you often beat her.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.029
Dana MacNamara was found
in a drainage ditch

09:22.062 --> 09:24.131
on Staten Island

09:24.164 --> 09:27.067
a week after she went missing,
naked.

09:27.100 --> 09:31.138
Her clothing dumped
next to her dead body.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.906
She was sexually assaulted.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.908
Her hands and feet
were bound.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.277
She was strangled manually.

09:37.310 --> 09:41.081
But that's not all.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.016
I've heard all this before.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.252
You beat her after
she was already dead.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.722
Kicked repeatedly, post-mortem,
in the ribs and the head,

09:48.756 --> 09:49.723
and then--
That's enough.

09:49.757 --> 09:50.624
You mutilated her body.

09:50.658 --> 09:53.193
Took a knife
and carved out her chest.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.028
I'm innocent.
Tell me, Mr. Rickett,

09:55.062 --> 09:56.163
what kind of man does that?

09:56.196 --> 09:57.931
A smart man
or a sick man?

09:57.965 --> 10:00.968
Somebody intelligent
or an animal?

10:01.001 --> 10:03.070
A man with no control.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.138
Shut up!

10:11.879 --> 10:15.248
[breathing deeply]

10:15.282 --> 10:18.752
[whistles a song]

10:18.786 --> 10:28.261
*

10:40.073 --> 10:41.074
There he is.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.209
Sit.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.711
Detective Elliot Stabler,

10:43.744 --> 10:46.279
shining star of
the New York Police Department.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.415
You miss me?

10:48.448 --> 10:50.283
You old bastard.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.152
You know I missed you.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.187
This is Kerry Lynn Palmer,
12 years old.

10:54.221 --> 10:57.691
Her body was found
in the Hudson River a week ago.

10:57.725 --> 11:00.460
She'd been raped, strangled,
mutilated post-mortem,

11:00.493 --> 11:03.030
same way as Dana MacNamara.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.065
The medical examiner estimates

11:05.098 --> 11:08.001
she'd been dumped
in the river one hour

11:08.035 --> 11:11.271
before she was discovered.

11:11.304 --> 11:15.008
I'll bet the killer
wasn't counting on that.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.747
Now we can start.

11:31.959 --> 11:34.061
(Stabler)
Sure you don't want
a lawyer, Gordon?

11:34.094 --> 11:36.063
[sighs]

11:36.096 --> 11:37.230
I'm sure.

11:37.264 --> 11:40.067
I gotta tell ya,
I don't think

11:40.100 --> 11:41.201
that's too smart.

11:41.234 --> 11:44.137
Shoot me when I start to care
about what you think.

11:44.171 --> 11:46.073
How was California?

11:46.106 --> 11:47.507
Hot.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.508
Why'd you leave?

11:48.541 --> 11:50.143
Because it was hot.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.047
So how you been, Gordon?

11:54.081 --> 11:56.049
Life been treatin' you well
since we last spoke?

11:56.083 --> 11:57.217
I'm fine.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.485
Financial problems?

11:58.518 --> 11:59.787
I get by.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.021
What's your job again?

12:01.054 --> 12:03.090
I work
with hazardous materials.

12:03.123 --> 12:05.025
You dispose
of hazardous materials.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.026
That's what I said.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.194
So you're
a garbageman?

12:07.227 --> 12:09.462
I'm a taxpaying citizen.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.498
I'm not ashamed to say that.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.333
What happened
to that bar you owned?
I sold it.

12:13.366 --> 12:14.467
(Stabler)
Wasn't that in your family

12:14.501 --> 12:15.903
for a few generations?

12:15.936 --> 12:17.104
You inherited that place
from your mom.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.806
It's a shame.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.073
Thanks for your sympathy.

12:20.107 --> 12:23.043
So you went to California.
You fly?

12:23.076 --> 12:24.111
No.
Drive?

12:24.144 --> 12:26.146
I don't own a car.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.380
Teleport?

12:27.414 --> 12:29.182
[laughter]

12:29.216 --> 12:31.184
I took the bus.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.385
Directly to California

12:32.419 --> 12:35.288
or did you live
someplace along the way?

12:35.322 --> 12:37.557
A lot of states
between here and there,

12:37.590 --> 12:40.127
like Nevada, Arizona--

12:40.160 --> 12:41.128
Did you live in those states

12:41.161 --> 12:43.230
before you got to California?

12:43.263 --> 12:45.899
[lights buzz]

12:45.933 --> 12:48.068
Why'd you leave California?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.136
What, are you deaf?

12:49.169 --> 12:51.038
I said I didn't like it.

12:51.071 --> 12:52.940
You were there
almost a decade.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.107
Well, maybe he was getting
his head together.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.275
That's what they do there,
you know.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.344
He was deciding what he wanted
to do with his freedom.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.946
I think he's decided
he's gonna be a garbageman.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.080
But you can pick up garbage
anywhere.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.049
Why come back here?

13:02.082 --> 13:03.116
My aunt died.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.052
I needed to take care

13:05.085 --> 13:06.854
of things,
decided to stay.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.256
That's very decent of you,
Gordon. I'm sorry for your loss.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.091
No, you're not.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.126
You're laughing at me.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.495
You wrecked a man's life,
and you think it's a big joke.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.197
I wrecked your life?

13:17.230 --> 13:18.265
Tried to.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.599
I must be
a pretty powerful guy.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.334
I know you think you are.
Are you hungry?

13:21.368 --> 13:22.202
I'm starting to get hungry.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.436
Would you like
something to eat, Gordon?

13:23.470 --> 13:25.138
No.
Mr. Rickett...

13:25.172 --> 13:26.840
Where were you
between the hours

13:26.874 --> 13:29.142
of 4 p.m. Sunday and
3 a.m. the following Monday?

13:29.176 --> 13:30.143
Home.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.544
The entire time?

13:31.578 --> 13:32.545
Yeah.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.147
There was nobody
there with you?

13:34.181 --> 13:35.082
I was alone.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.549
Home alone, that's
what you said last time.

13:36.583 --> 13:37.851
That's a 14-year-old alibi,
Gordon.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.086
Spend a lot of time alone?

13:39.119 --> 13:40.187
Yeah.
You don't have a girlfriend?

13:40.220 --> 13:42.455
Nobody special.
Nobody special?

13:42.489 --> 13:43.290
No.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.025
When did your aunt die?
A month ago.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.393
Why weren't you at work?
When?

13:46.426 --> 13:47.995
Sunday at 4:00
to the following morning?

13:48.028 --> 13:49.362
I don't work weekends.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.398
Because you're
a trash collector.
I work with hazardous materials.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.266
What are you driving these days,
besides a garbage truck?

13:53.300 --> 13:54.201
I said I don't own a car.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.269
Mr. Rickett,
do you know this girl?
No.

13:56.303 --> 13:57.570
You've never seen her before?

13:57.604 --> 13:59.339
Not once.
So nobody
will ever tell us

13:59.372 --> 14:01.408
that they saw you
talking to this girl

14:01.441 --> 14:03.276
or even were in
the same vicinity as she was?

14:03.310 --> 14:06.213
No way.
Why did you and
Vanessa Serafino break up?

14:06.246 --> 14:07.414
Because you told her

14:07.447 --> 14:08.581
that I killed that girl.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.617
No, she called off the wedding
long before I arrested you.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.519
I just can't remember why.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.554
Didn't it have something
to do with medical school?
Yeah, that's it.

14:14.587 --> 14:17.157
You told her you were getting
your medical degree at NYU.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.159
I was going
to night school.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.393
You were pretending
to be a medical student.

14:20.427 --> 14:21.995
I mean, how long
did you think

14:22.029 --> 14:23.630
you were gonna pull
that one off?

14:23.663 --> 14:25.298
You gonna pull

14:25.332 --> 14:27.134
people off the street, start
performing surgery on 'em?

14:27.167 --> 14:28.335
I couldn't get
financial aid.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.602
Money had nothing
to do with it, Gordon.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.438
You never finished high school.
Come on.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.040
Lie to your fiancÃ©e.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.042
Don't lie to me.
I'm not lying
about anything.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.043
You lied about

14:36.076 --> 14:37.244
your current girlfriend.
No.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.946
I said there was
nobody special.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.114
So who's this woman
that keeps visiting you at work?

14:41.148 --> 14:42.315
You're the detective.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.350
Your ex-fiancÃ©e,

14:43.383 --> 14:45.185
Vanessa, the one
with the pigtails,

14:45.218 --> 14:46.586
she took out a restraining
order against you

14:46.619 --> 14:48.321
after the trial.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.456
She changed her name,
left town.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.058
What happened?
You threaten her?

14:51.091 --> 14:52.359
I never spoke
to that skank again.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.360
You said that your aunt

14:53.393 --> 14:55.495
died a month ago.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.497
Yeah?

14:57.530 --> 14:59.199
That's why you came back
to New York?

14:59.232 --> 15:00.167
So?

15:00.200 --> 15:04.204
You came back
six months ago, Mr. Rickett.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.306
She was sick.
I took care of her.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.407
Like you're her doctor?

15:07.440 --> 15:09.609
She needed help.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.611
I didn't want to put her
in a nursing home,

15:11.644 --> 15:12.612
so I came back,
period.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.447
It's very loving
of you, Gordon.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.216
Those places are hellholes.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.350
She needed help.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.052
I stayed with her
'til she died.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.687
Why did you leave California,
Mr. Rickett?

15:20.720 --> 15:22.956
You already asked me
20 times.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.124
(Stabler)
Dana MacNamara
was murdered

15:24.157 --> 15:27.127
a couple weeks after Vanessa
broke off the engagement.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.129
On a scale of 1 to 10,

15:29.162 --> 15:31.164
how mad did Vanessa make you?

15:31.198 --> 15:32.165
I didn't care.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.400
Now, you were fired

15:33.433 --> 15:34.667
three weeks ago,
Mr. Rickett, weren't you?

15:34.701 --> 15:35.735
I wasn't fired.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.038
They gave the jobs
to one of their mafia buddies.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.040
They screwed you.
It was political.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.608
Yeah, but you get caught up
in the process.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.010
They treat you
like you're nothing.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.177
They're nothing.
I know,

15:44.211 --> 15:46.746
but they got the power and
you're the one who's unemployed.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.182
Because I'm being disrespected
again, as usual.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.050
Why is that, Gordon?

15:50.083 --> 15:50.850
Why are people always
disrespecting you?

15:50.883 --> 15:52.552
I don't know.
How can you take it?

15:52.585 --> 15:55.255
I'm not gonna take it anymore.
They don't know!

15:55.288 --> 15:57.090
They don't know anything
about you.
That's right.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.358
I'm gonna show 'em.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.392
Gonna show 'em, aren't you?
Yeah.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.428
Who?
Everybody.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.562
Yeah, 'cause no one's innocent.
Your bosses...
That's right.

16:02.595 --> 16:03.730
And girlfriends.
Yeah.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.398
The kids.
Even the kids!

16:05.432 --> 16:07.434
What are you
gonna do to them?
I'm gonna hurt the kids!

16:07.467 --> 16:08.368
Hurt your kids, Stabler.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.137
We're talking
about Kerry Lynn Palmer here.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.404
I'm gonna kill
all the kids!

16:11.438 --> 16:12.739
What are you gonna do
about it, huh?

16:12.772 --> 16:14.407
Tell me how you killed her.
And then
I'm gonna kill

16:14.441 --> 16:16.476
their puppies, then I'm gonna
kill their kitties.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.345
I'm a psycho killer!

16:18.378 --> 16:20.313
What are you gonna do
about it, huh? Come on!

16:20.347 --> 16:22.382
Come on!

16:22.415 --> 16:24.284
I'm a psycho killer!

16:24.317 --> 16:27.220
What are you gonna do
about it, huh?

16:27.254 --> 16:28.488
[chuckles]

16:28.521 --> 16:30.557
What are you gonna do?

16:30.590 --> 16:34.561
Come on!
Come on!

16:34.594 --> 16:37.297
[laughs]

16:37.330 --> 16:39.566
You're a hoot, Stabler.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.502
Agh!
"Kill the kids!"

16:47.440 --> 16:49.409
You're just like
I remember ya.

16:49.442 --> 16:53.613
Only now they send you in here
with a babysitter.

16:53.646 --> 16:57.350
You bust on me
because I'm a garbageman?

16:57.384 --> 16:59.452
Well, what about you?

16:59.486 --> 17:00.453
You're a--

17:00.487 --> 17:02.622
an animal.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.324
A Neanderthal.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.492
Sit down, Mr. Rickett.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.627
You see that?

17:10.763 --> 17:13.133
It's a little reminder
I've got of your partner.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.467
I never forgot him.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.602
I had a--

17:15.635 --> 17:16.636
little accident

17:16.669 --> 17:19.639
last time we were together
in a room like this.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.474
I accidentally let him

17:21.508 --> 17:23.410
put me through
a plate glass window.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.578
Did I cry about it?

17:25.612 --> 17:26.846
Did I sue the city?

17:26.879 --> 17:29.116
Look for a handout,
like all the other schmucks?

17:29.149 --> 17:31.551
No.

17:31.584 --> 17:35.122
Because I'm a man.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.427
He didn't hear
what he wanted from me,

17:40.460 --> 17:43.763
and he had
a temper tantrum.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.832
He has no self control.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.300
Like a baby.

17:47.334 --> 17:51.104
Like a stupid, selfish,
whiny child.

18:00.247 --> 18:03.850
Who wants something to eat?

18:11.291 --> 18:12.525
I want cheese on that,

18:12.559 --> 18:13.660
whatever has
a really strong smell,

18:13.693 --> 18:16.696
and extra raw onions,
like double the normal amount.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.565
That's it.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.233
Good.
Thanks.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.501
Why don't we really
mess with him

18:21.534 --> 18:23.236
and order a couple
of filet mignons?

18:23.270 --> 18:24.504
If only we had it
in the budget.

18:24.537 --> 18:29.209
Good luck, Elliot.
'Night, Cap.

18:29.242 --> 18:30.677
Elliot, we're almost
five hours into this.

18:30.710 --> 18:31.678
I can still get to him.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.713
We gotta start thinking
about a different tactic

18:33.746 --> 18:36.249
than getting creative
with takeout.

18:36.283 --> 18:39.486
Listen to that last thing
Rickett said about kids.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.288
They're greedy.
They're out of control.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.422
They're stupid.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.424
Now, for Rickett, that is
the worst insult he can give.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.593
This guy is never
gonna confess.

18:46.626 --> 18:47.727
Captain, I know this guy.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.797
He's like an addict.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.265
He's hooked on the rage.

18:52.299 --> 18:53.800
Not expressing it,
controlling it.

18:53.833 --> 18:57.570
He gets off on denying himself
an outlet for his anger.

18:57.604 --> 19:00.473
And it builds,
and it builds

19:00.507 --> 19:02.509
'til he finds a girl,

19:02.542 --> 19:04.277
and he takes it out on her.

19:04.311 --> 19:05.645
Rickett was playing you
in there.

19:05.678 --> 19:09.616
He was perfectly in control.
Were you?

19:12.419 --> 19:13.453
Rickett thinks
he's in charge.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.623
You make sure
he knows he's not.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.791
Just keep
pushing his buttons.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.660
See which one lights him up.

19:26.366 --> 19:27.367
(Stabler)
Boy, that was good.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.602
You sure you don't
want anything, Gordon?
No.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.471
You're gonna spend
a long time with us.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.473
Might as well get
a free meal out of it, you know?

19:33.506 --> 19:35.275
I'm not hungry.
God, that was good.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.878
Could you explain
one thing to me?

19:38.911 --> 19:39.879
Why'd you leave California?

19:39.912 --> 19:41.514
You're out of your mind.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.650
No, seriously, just give me
an explanation I can grasp.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.252
Why here?
Why now?

19:45.285 --> 19:46.319
My aunt died.

19:46.353 --> 19:49.322
Mr. Rickett,
you don't have an aunt.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.890
Your father was
an only child,

19:50.923 --> 19:53.760
and your mother
had two sisters, long deceased.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.262
You got wrong information.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.330
That's your problem.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.333
What's this?

20:00.367 --> 20:02.235
Oh, Detective Tutuola.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.670
(Fin)
'Sup, Gordy?

20:03.703 --> 20:04.671
All that talk

20:04.704 --> 20:05.405
about telling the truth,

20:05.438 --> 20:07.740
"I'm a genius,
cops are punks."

20:07.774 --> 20:09.376
You're embarrassing
yourself, man.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.511
You're lying your ass off,
and everybody knows it.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.246
No, I'm not.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.414
Talk to Sandra Brophy lately?

20:14.447 --> 20:16.783
Remember?

20:16.816 --> 20:17.617
Your girlfriend
from California.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.786
(Fin)
She told us to tell you "hello",

20:19.819 --> 20:21.688
then rip off your nuts
and feed 'em to you.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.356
You're making friends
all over the country,

20:23.390 --> 20:25.525
aren't you, Gordon?
Whatever she told you
is a lie.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.459
(Fin)
She told us

20:26.493 --> 20:28.027
you tried to rape
her 14 year-old daughter.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.596
And then you ran away
like a little girl.

20:29.629 --> 20:30.630
(Fin)
The only reason
you're sitting here

20:30.663 --> 20:31.864
right now is 'cause

20:31.898 --> 20:33.533
that kid's too scared
to talk to the cops.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.735
The girl had
emotional problems.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.904
The only problem that she had
was running into you.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.639
(Fin)
We also heard you got evicted

20:39.672 --> 20:40.673
from your apartment
down there

20:40.707 --> 20:43.009
a week and a half
before you attacked her kid.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.644
(Stabler)
Let's see, you murdered
Dana MacNamara

20:44.677 --> 20:46.346
after your fiancÃ©e dumps you.

20:46.379 --> 20:49.382
You murder Kerry Lynn Palmer
after you get fired.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.584
(Benson)
Tell us about Nevada.

20:51.618 --> 20:52.719
And Arizona.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.587
Carson, Nevada?

20:54.621 --> 20:56.823
Chloe Lynch, age 13.
(Benson)
Missing.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.491
Presumed dead.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.527
Carson police questioned you
about it.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.395
Tempe, Arizona.
Heather Morrison, 11.

21:02.429 --> 21:03.396
Missing.

21:03.430 --> 21:04.497
Presumed dead.

21:04.531 --> 21:05.965
You were questioned and
released for lack of evidence.

21:05.998 --> 21:06.966
That's why you kept moving.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.735
That's why you left California.

21:08.768 --> 21:12.004
That's why you were
packing to leave New York.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.740
You know, I've dreamed
about this day.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.475
Seeing that look on your face

21:15.508 --> 21:19.846
when I catch you in every lie
and every mistake.

21:19.879 --> 21:22.549
And you've already made
your biggest one.

21:22.582 --> 21:23.550
Yeah?

21:23.583 --> 21:26.853
Yeah,
you came back here.

21:26.886 --> 21:30.022
You haven't forgotten me?

21:33.693 --> 21:36.829
I haven't
forgotten you either.

21:47.474 --> 21:48.441
Where are you going?

21:48.475 --> 21:51.511
To the crib.
See you in 30.

21:51.544 --> 21:52.945
Okay, let's get in there.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.847
No.
Why?

21:54.881 --> 21:56.683
Rickett's sleeping.
And you're letting him?

21:56.716 --> 21:58.651
About ten minutes.
Then I'll wake him up.

21:58.685 --> 21:59.819
Let him sleep some more.
Wake him up again.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.521
Just keep doing it
'til the sun comes up.

22:01.554 --> 22:02.755
Okay.
I'll go in when you wake him.

22:02.789 --> 22:05.425
No.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.426
Why not?

22:06.459 --> 22:07.259
Look, I'm changing it up.

22:07.293 --> 22:09.862
Nothing personal,
just changing it up.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.664
Oh, so you're gonna
do this by yourself?

22:11.698 --> 22:13.933
What, are you
a one-man squad now?
He called you my babysitter.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.502
So what?
So I wanna use that!

22:15.535 --> 22:17.704
I want him to think
that when I go in there,

22:17.737 --> 22:19.972
I'm gonna throw him right
through that window again.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.611
I know what I'm doing.

22:27.514 --> 22:28.781
Okay.

22:47.534 --> 22:48.501
Wake up, Gordy.

22:48.535 --> 22:49.502
Enough time to sleep

22:49.536 --> 22:50.570
when you're dead.

22:54.941 --> 22:56.543
You drink it.

22:56.576 --> 22:57.777
You look like
you could use it

22:57.810 --> 22:58.745
more than me.

22:58.778 --> 23:01.448
I'm getting a second wind.
I feel pretty good.

23:01.481 --> 23:02.982
Get this look, Elliot.

23:03.015 --> 23:05.151
It's like I'm
a cheatin' boyfriend.

23:05.184 --> 23:06.653
Don't worry, baby.
I'll always love you.

23:06.686 --> 23:07.920
You're funny.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.622
Yeah, you're hilarious,

23:09.656 --> 23:10.457
acting all betrayed.

23:10.490 --> 23:12.525
We snowed you, Rickett.
Get over it.

23:12.559 --> 23:13.526
You're a good actor.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.028
Unless that wasn't acting.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.498
You on the pipe
back in the day?

23:18.531 --> 23:19.766
I think he's mad
at you, Fin.

23:19.799 --> 23:20.867
Bet it was real tough,

23:20.900 --> 23:23.736
growing up in a studio
apartment, like cockroaches.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.538
You should be real proud
of yourself.

23:25.572 --> 23:26.673
This guy's good.

23:26.706 --> 23:27.940
I know.

23:27.974 --> 23:29.576
It's like he's turning
the tables or something.

23:29.609 --> 23:32.745
Damn, he's like some reverse
psychology evil genius.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.146
You're both pathetic.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.347
Who's pathetic?

23:35.381 --> 23:37.884
It's amazing how much you know
about being a bastard child.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.486
That's personal experience,
Rickett?

23:39.519 --> 23:41.554
I know who my daddy is.
I do too,

23:41.588 --> 23:43.556
but mine stuck around,
not like your daddy.

23:43.590 --> 23:44.524
What do you know about it?

23:44.557 --> 23:45.458
Everybody knows
everything about you, Gordon,

23:45.492 --> 23:47.594
because you told
the shrink who evaluated you

23:47.627 --> 23:49.662
before your trial
14 years ago.

23:49.696 --> 23:51.631
Let's see now,
your father abandoned you

23:51.664 --> 23:54.100
when you were 18 months old.
Shrinks make a big deal
out of everything.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.503
Six months later, your mother
gets pregnant again

23:56.536 --> 23:58.137
by another guy
who won't marry her.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.972
Your sister is born.
How is your sister, Gordon?

24:00.006 --> 24:01.574
Ask her.
(Fin)
Yeah, I did.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.142
Must be a big
kick in the balls

24:03.175 --> 24:04.844
to know your own blood
thinks you're guilty

24:04.877 --> 24:06.012
as sin.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.614
No, Gordon doesn't care
about his sister.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.916
She ruined his life.
That's what he told the shrink.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.684
So now you got
two babies in the house.

24:11.718 --> 24:13.586
Only that's too much work
for Mommy,

24:13.620 --> 24:15.221
so you're forced
to grow up, huh?

24:15.254 --> 24:16.989
No more bottles,
no more diapers,

24:17.023 --> 24:18.057
definitely no more crying.

24:18.090 --> 24:21.160
Your mom would kick your ass
if you shed a tear, huh?

24:21.193 --> 24:22.829
That selfish bitch!

24:22.862 --> 24:24.731
[whining]
You ruined my life

24:24.764 --> 24:26.699
because you wouldn't
take care of me.

24:26.733 --> 24:30.136
I'm not gonna talk to you
about my mother.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.571
(Fin)
"My mommy never loved me.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.940
I had no childhood."

24:33.973 --> 24:35.508
I never said that
to the shrink.

24:35.542 --> 24:37.143
(Stabler)
No, that's what the shrink
said about you.

24:37.176 --> 24:38.911
"Subject"--that's you--

24:38.945 --> 24:41.147
"has a childlike view
of the world.

24:41.180 --> 24:43.883
"Believes the world
has conspired

24:43.916 --> 24:46.719
"to deny him success
and happiness

24:46.753 --> 24:51.524
"in spite of his inflated
estimate of his own

24:51.558 --> 24:52.725
intelligence."

24:52.759 --> 24:54.861
She just called you
a moron, Gordon.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.228
Think I care
what that bitch said?

24:56.262 --> 24:58.898
Oh, yeah, I do. Look at you.
It's eating you up.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.933
If "that bitch" were
in this room right now,

25:00.967 --> 25:02.168
you'd tear her apart.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.704
If "that bitch" was
in this room right now,

25:04.737 --> 25:06.639
and she were 11 years old,

25:06.673 --> 25:08.240
you'd kill her.

25:08.274 --> 25:11.544
I don't need a Ph.D. to know
what kind of person you are.

25:11.578 --> 25:12.945
You're a loser.

25:12.979 --> 25:15.648
You had a tough childhood.
That makes you special?

25:15.682 --> 25:16.916
That makes you a victim?

25:16.949 --> 25:18.985
You're nothing.

25:19.018 --> 25:22.589
You contribute nothing.

25:22.622 --> 25:26.092
The reason your life sucks
is because

25:26.125 --> 25:28.928
you've done nothing.

25:30.196 --> 25:33.566
[laughs]

25:33.600 --> 25:35.267
"I've done nothing."

25:37.670 --> 25:38.638
You counting
the little children

25:38.671 --> 25:39.739
that you've raped and murdered?

25:39.772 --> 25:40.907
Is that what you're saying
to me?

25:40.940 --> 25:43.710
You wanna walk me through that,
you piece of garbage?

25:43.743 --> 25:46.112
Tell me how good you are
at torturing children!

25:46.145 --> 25:48.948
Tell me how strong you've gotta
be to kill a little girl!

25:48.981 --> 25:50.717
Huh?

25:50.750 --> 25:53.052
What's the problem?

25:53.085 --> 25:54.821
A grown woman too much
of a challenge for you?

25:54.854 --> 25:56.889
I should do to you what you do
to those little girls.

25:56.923 --> 25:59.125
I should put you in pigtails,
you little bitch.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.593
Come on, you little bitch,

26:00.627 --> 26:01.728
I want you to cry for me.

26:01.761 --> 26:02.494
Come on, tell me!

26:02.528 --> 26:05.031
[spits]
Come on!
Cry for me!

26:05.064 --> 26:06.065
(Fin)
Elliot!
Get out!

26:06.098 --> 26:07.066
Come on, man.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.367
Come on!

26:08.400 --> 26:10.837
Come on, you little bitch!

26:10.870 --> 26:13.072
Tell me about
the little girls, huh?

26:13.105 --> 26:16.075
Huh?
Tough guy.

26:16.108 --> 26:17.710
[sighs]

26:17.744 --> 26:19.345
What the hell was that?
Nothing.

26:19.378 --> 26:22.148
So Elliot screams at him
for a couple of hours,

26:22.181 --> 26:23.616
and what's the plan
after that?

26:23.650 --> 26:24.617
I don't know.

26:24.651 --> 26:26.619
That was the end
of the plan.

26:31.758 --> 26:37.063
[sirens wail]

26:37.096 --> 26:39.799
Night again.

26:39.832 --> 26:40.566
Looks like you and me

26:40.599 --> 26:42.802
are gonna say good-bye
pretty soon.

26:46.706 --> 26:48.307
Messed with my chair, huh?

26:48.340 --> 26:49.676
Screwed with the lights,

26:49.709 --> 26:51.678
cranked up the heat.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.045
I miss anything?

26:54.747 --> 26:57.717
Here, fix the chair
if you want.

26:57.750 --> 26:58.718
The food--

26:58.751 --> 27:00.787
Get you to eat or drink

27:00.820 --> 27:04.090
so you have to ask
to use the john.

27:04.123 --> 27:06.726
Try to make you
need something from us.

27:06.759 --> 27:10.830
Food, sleep, whatever.

27:10.863 --> 27:15.001
You didn't need anything.

27:15.034 --> 27:19.772
You are your own man.

27:19.806 --> 27:23.776
And you know what else?

27:23.810 --> 27:24.877
[keys clink]

27:24.911 --> 27:26.846
You're smarter.

27:26.879 --> 27:28.080
At the end of the day,

27:28.114 --> 27:30.182
that's one thing
I'm pretty sure of.

27:30.216 --> 27:34.053
You don't know how much
it pains me to have to say that.

27:37.289 --> 27:39.425
And it's weird
because back then,

27:39.458 --> 27:43.429
with Dana...

27:43.462 --> 27:46.232
I thought I knew it all.

27:46.265 --> 27:51.070
That it didn't matter that
we couldn't find the place

27:51.103 --> 27:52.304
where you murdered her.

27:52.338 --> 27:53.706
Didn't matter
that we couldn't prove

27:53.740 --> 27:56.142
how you dumped the body.

27:56.175 --> 28:00.747
I knew you were guilty.

28:04.183 --> 28:07.754
I thought that was enough,
but, uh...

28:07.787 --> 28:11.390
we both know
how that turned out.

28:11.423 --> 28:14.894
See, back then, I thought
you were a pedophile.

28:14.927 --> 28:17.864
And pedophiles, you know,
in their own sick way,

28:17.897 --> 28:19.398
think they love children.

28:19.431 --> 28:22.134
They, uh, build
a relationship with them.

28:22.168 --> 28:25.972
They--they believe that they
have an emotional connection

28:26.005 --> 28:29.809
to the child.

28:29.842 --> 28:32.411
You know how you get
a pedophile to confess?

28:32.444 --> 28:34.480
You offer him
the opportunity.

28:34.513 --> 28:38.184
Some of 'em just feel
so guilty about it,

28:38.217 --> 28:41.120
that they're dying
to tell ya.

28:41.153 --> 28:44.824
[buzzing]

28:44.857 --> 28:49.195
But that's not you,
is it, Gordon?

28:49.228 --> 28:51.230
I was all wrong.

28:55.802 --> 28:57.904
Working in SVU,
I learned the difference

28:57.937 --> 29:02.441
between a pedophile
and a man who rapes children.

29:02.474 --> 29:03.943
You don't care
about the kids.

29:03.976 --> 29:06.813
You hate the kids.

29:06.846 --> 29:10.950
It's not about attraction
or power or dominance.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.885
It's about annihilation.

29:12.919 --> 29:15.554
You defile and destroy her,

29:15.587 --> 29:20.492
because she has
what you'll never have--

29:20.526 --> 29:22.795
Hope.

29:22.829 --> 29:24.831
Trust.

29:27.233 --> 29:28.234
Potential.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.042
Is that why I do it?

29:36.075 --> 29:37.043
That's part of it.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.410
The other part,

29:38.444 --> 29:41.881
the part that I've been trying
to get at all night,

29:41.914 --> 29:43.482
is the rage.

29:43.515 --> 29:46.218
You're very good
at hiding it.

29:46.252 --> 29:48.454
It's...

29:48.487 --> 29:50.990
unbelievable.

29:51.023 --> 29:52.158
But I know it's there.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.860
I mean, I can see it,

29:53.893 --> 29:55.461
even when you're sitting
still like now.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.836
Gordon...

30:03.870 --> 30:04.937
You're kidding yourself

30:04.971 --> 30:06.205
if you think
you're controlling it.

30:06.238 --> 30:08.307
It's controlling you.

30:08.340 --> 30:12.211
Every lie you tell
to cover your inadequacies,

30:12.244 --> 30:15.547
every perceived insult
you think you're getting,

30:15.581 --> 30:19.051
just feeds it.

30:22.121 --> 30:27.193
You're lecturing me
about rage?

30:27.226 --> 30:29.028
Are you kidding?

30:29.061 --> 30:31.263
I'm not.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.866
What do you know
about controlling anything?

30:33.900 --> 30:35.501
I don't murder people.

30:35.534 --> 30:39.972
Give it time.

30:40.006 --> 30:42.241
You say you see something
in me.

30:42.274 --> 30:45.277
Well, I see something
in you too.

30:45.311 --> 30:49.281
You think you control.

30:49.315 --> 30:51.951
You can't.

30:54.954 --> 30:57.289
You're controlled.

30:57.323 --> 30:58.925
By your boss,

30:58.958 --> 31:01.027
by your job,
by your wife,

31:01.060 --> 31:04.130
your kids.

31:04.163 --> 31:08.968
What would you be
if all those controls went away?

31:11.237 --> 31:14.540
I'd be you.

31:21.313 --> 31:22.982
[door opens]

31:26.085 --> 31:28.921
(Cragen)
Mr. Rickett, you're free to go.

31:52.979 --> 31:54.613
Look, I know
we're all disappointed

31:54.646 --> 31:56.615
about this hump being back
on the streets again.

31:56.648 --> 31:57.849
But we get past it,

31:57.883 --> 32:00.686
and we find the link between
Rickett and Kerry Lynn Palmer.

32:00.719 --> 32:02.388
Or something that leads us
to where he killed her.

32:02.421 --> 32:03.589
(Munch)
They never found that
14 years ago.

32:03.622 --> 32:04.690
I doubt we'll find it now.

32:04.723 --> 32:07.293
When I arrested Rickett
for Dana MacNamara's murder,

32:07.326 --> 32:08.394
he lawyered up immediately.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.596
This time we got 24 hours worth
of interrogation.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.598
I wanna go over everything
that came out of his mouth.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.500
That's what we've been doing,
Elliot.

32:14.533 --> 32:17.436
You know this crap about
"the truth will set you free"?

32:17.469 --> 32:19.171
Every other word
out of Rickett's mouth

32:19.205 --> 32:20.239
was a fabrication.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.740
No, not everything.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.976
(Fin)
The dude couldn't even tell us
about his job.

32:24.010 --> 32:25.277
He kept saying he worked
with hazardous materials.

32:25.311 --> 32:27.079
Okay.

32:27.113 --> 32:29.148
Let's start with that.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.250
Why lie about something
that's insignificant?

32:31.283 --> 32:32.618
(Benson)
Same reason he told his fiancÃ©e

32:32.651 --> 32:34.020
that he was
a med student,

32:34.053 --> 32:36.122
just to make himself
look better.

32:36.155 --> 32:39.491
Okay, so let's call
his work and education...

32:39.525 --> 32:41.627
exaggerations?

32:41.660 --> 32:44.263
Vanity lies.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.265
What else?

32:46.298 --> 32:47.466
Everything that went down
in California.

32:47.499 --> 32:48.634
That's a guilt lie.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.169
He attacks
his girlfriend's daughter.

32:50.202 --> 32:52.504
That's incriminating.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.040
It's obvious
why he lied about that.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.541
(Cragen)
Claims he didn't have a car

32:55.574 --> 32:56.742
or access to one.

32:56.775 --> 32:58.410
We can't prove it,
but we know it's false.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.379
No other way
to dump the body in the river.

33:00.412 --> 33:03.082
Guilt.
(Benson)
He's lying about having
a girlfriend now.

33:03.115 --> 33:05.351
You'd think that he'd want us
to know that.

33:05.384 --> 33:07.253
Just to prove
that he doesn't need

33:07.286 --> 33:08.420
to have sex
with little girls.

33:08.454 --> 33:10.322
Did we get the LUDS
on his phone?

33:10.356 --> 33:11.590
(Cragen)
No, we're still waiting.

33:11.623 --> 33:14.760
You think he would tell
a girlfriend about this?

33:14.793 --> 33:16.762
Rickett does work alone,
but if he's hiding her,

33:16.795 --> 33:20.599
maybe he's afraid she'll lead us
in the right direction.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.501
What about his aunt?

33:22.534 --> 33:24.103
(Munch)
Doesn't have one.
So why lie about her?

33:24.136 --> 33:26.772
(Fin)
To explain his move
from California?

33:26.805 --> 33:31.710
A lot better ways to do that.

33:36.182 --> 33:37.049
That means something.

33:37.083 --> 33:39.285
If the phone dump
gives us the girlfriend,

33:39.318 --> 33:40.752
she may be able
to illuminate.

33:40.786 --> 33:43.455
That's good work, Elliot.

33:43.489 --> 33:44.756
Not good enough.

33:48.660 --> 33:51.097
[knocking on door]

33:51.130 --> 33:52.164
Linda Cusick?

33:52.198 --> 33:53.565
Yeah?
Police.

33:53.599 --> 33:55.834
We'd like to talk to you
about your boyfriend, Gordon.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.136
Oh, no.

33:57.169 --> 33:59.271
God, you guys are brutes.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.673
Yeah, did Gordon warn you
we'd be coming around?
No.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.842
But he told me how you framed
him and everything.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.444
How long have you two
been dating?

34:05.477 --> 34:06.778
I don't remember.

34:06.812 --> 34:08.580
And anyways,
we broke up weeks ago,

34:08.614 --> 34:09.715
so I can't help you.

34:09.748 --> 34:10.582
Try again, sweetheart.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.384
You call him twice a day,
every day.

34:12.418 --> 34:13.785
Hey, Linda?

34:13.819 --> 34:15.487
You don't want to lie
to us anymore.

34:15.521 --> 34:18.090
I'm not in the mood.

34:18.124 --> 34:19.491
We've been dating
two months.

34:19.525 --> 34:20.592
Last Sunday night

34:20.626 --> 34:23.595
and Monday morning,
did you see him or speak to him?

34:23.629 --> 34:24.830
No.

34:24.863 --> 34:25.697
Why not?

34:25.731 --> 34:27.399
We don't spend
every second together.

34:27.433 --> 34:29.335
You ever meet his aunt?
No!

34:29.368 --> 34:31.203
He doesn't have any family.

34:31.237 --> 34:32.538
Does he?

34:32.571 --> 34:33.539
Do you have a car?

34:33.572 --> 34:35.741
No.
Who needs a car in New York?

34:35.774 --> 34:36.742
Your boyfriend did.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.177
He ever borrow someone's?

34:38.210 --> 34:39.411
(Linda)
Ask him.

34:39.445 --> 34:41.580
I don't know.
I swear.

34:41.613 --> 34:44.150
I never saw him driving
if that makes you happy.

34:44.183 --> 34:45.817
Linda.

34:45.851 --> 34:48.120
Did he ever make you
dress up, you know,

34:48.154 --> 34:51.490
play games where you're supposed
to be a little girl?

34:51.523 --> 34:54.560
That should set off
some bells.

34:54.593 --> 34:57.429
What is this?

34:57.463 --> 34:59.798
Aphrodite Salon.
What is it?

34:59.831 --> 35:02.468
I'm allowed to take stuff home
to test it out. I work there.

35:02.501 --> 35:06.572
Two blocks from
Kerry Lynn Palmer's apartment.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.707
Sorry, I've never seen her.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.476
Well, have you ever heard
Linda's boyfriend

35:10.509 --> 35:11.743
talking about a girl
named Kerry?

35:11.777 --> 35:13.512
Not that I can remember.

35:13.545 --> 35:14.713
I know Gordon's a thug,

35:14.746 --> 35:17.149
but I didn't think
he was into little kids.

35:17.183 --> 35:18.350
Why do you
call him a thug?

35:18.384 --> 35:19.518
Because all Linda's
boyfriends are.

35:19.551 --> 35:20.886
She picks up guys
in this neighborhood,

35:20.919 --> 35:23.322
even after I've told her
it's not a safe place.

35:23.355 --> 35:25.224
My salon gets robbed,

35:25.257 --> 35:26.225
my car gets stolen--

35:26.258 --> 35:27.659
When did your car
get stolen?

35:27.693 --> 35:29.495
Couple weeks ago.
Did you report it?

35:29.528 --> 35:30.862
Cops said it was probably

35:30.896 --> 35:31.730
just kids, joyriding.

35:31.763 --> 35:34.466
Took it to Staten Island
and torched it.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.467
Staten Island.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.269
Where Dana's body was found.

35:40.772 --> 35:42.641
(Siper)
Fire burned hot and long.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.376
Definitely used
an accelerant,

35:44.410 --> 35:47.846
which means any and all trace
evidence was probably gone.

35:47.879 --> 35:51.217
Now, there's a lot of crap
to sift through in this lot,

35:51.250 --> 35:52.318
but we'll look
at everything.

35:52.351 --> 35:53.552
So other than dumping

35:53.585 --> 35:55.421
Dana MacNamara's body here
14 years ago,

35:55.454 --> 35:56.955
what is his connection
to Staten Island?

35:56.988 --> 35:57.989
Never made one.

35:58.023 --> 36:00.859
So Dana was found
less than a mile from here,

36:00.892 --> 36:02.628
Kerry Lynn was dumped
in the Hudson,

36:02.661 --> 36:04.330
and then he drove
all the way out here

36:04.363 --> 36:05.664
to dump the car.

36:05.697 --> 36:08.967
Why is he
so comfortable here?

36:09.000 --> 36:12.804
He knows this place.

36:12.838 --> 36:16.308
Look at that.

36:16.342 --> 36:17.543
(Benson)
Nursing home.

36:17.576 --> 36:19.211
(Stabler)
Remember what Rickett said?

36:19.245 --> 36:21.813
He'd never put his aunt
in one of those dumps.

36:21.847 --> 36:23.415
He doesn't have an aunt.

36:23.449 --> 36:25.884
(nurse)
They're not really
blood relatives.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.219
Mrs. Larson grew up

36:27.253 --> 36:29.221
with Gordon's mother
back in Illinois.

36:29.255 --> 36:30.222
Is he in trouble?

36:30.256 --> 36:31.390
You could say that.

36:31.423 --> 36:33.925
I just want to know
in case he shows up.

36:33.959 --> 36:35.561
I can't have my patients
in danger.

36:35.594 --> 36:36.862
Why does Mr. Rickett
come here anymore?

36:36.895 --> 36:37.863
His aunt died.

36:37.896 --> 36:39.298
No, she didn't.

36:39.331 --> 36:41.600
She's been paralyzed
for 20 years,

36:41.633 --> 36:44.002
but for her age, Mrs. Larson's
healthy as a horse.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.437
(Mrs. Larson)
Well!

36:45.471 --> 36:47.873
I'm certainly
a popular girl these days.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.741
You getting a lot
of visitors, Mrs. Larson?

36:49.775 --> 36:51.910
Especially since Gordon

36:51.943 --> 36:53.479
is back from India.

36:53.512 --> 36:56.748
He was a Doctor Without Borders,
you know.

36:56.782 --> 36:58.917
Does he come and visit
you a lot?
He's my lifeline.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.018
Now that he's back,

37:00.051 --> 37:02.988
he's taking care of all my--
my finances,

37:03.021 --> 37:04.723
pays all my hospital bills.

37:04.756 --> 37:07.593
What else does Gordon
do for you, Mrs. Larson?

37:07.626 --> 37:08.960
Well, there's the gardening,
of course.

37:08.994 --> 37:10.562
And, uh,
general maintenance.

37:10.596 --> 37:14.333
And he said that he just bought
some new storm windows.

37:14.366 --> 37:16.302
For your house?

37:16.335 --> 37:18.370
He's been taking care of it
until I move back in.

37:18.404 --> 37:20.606
Where's your house?

37:22.874 --> 37:24.676
Car doesn't look like
it's seen the road

37:24.710 --> 37:25.811
since Dana MacNamara's murder.

37:25.844 --> 37:27.679
What do you want to bet
that CSU

37:27.713 --> 37:29.515
could find her DNA
in there?

37:40.859 --> 37:42.294
It's freezing in here.

37:42.328 --> 37:44.996
No heat.

37:45.030 --> 37:47.032
He's taking care
of this place for her?

37:47.065 --> 37:47.933
More like

37:47.966 --> 37:49.801
selling everything
that's not nailed down.

37:49.835 --> 37:51.737
Final notice...

37:51.770 --> 37:53.972
collection agencies...

37:54.005 --> 37:55.441
These are all months old.

37:55.474 --> 37:56.508
He's robbing her blind.

37:56.542 --> 37:57.343
I'm surprised
he didn't just

37:57.376 --> 37:58.510
sell the house
out from under her.

37:58.544 --> 38:01.279
He didn't sell the house because
he needed a place to work.

38:03.081 --> 38:04.416
[switch clicks]

38:04.450 --> 38:05.951
He's paying
the electrical bill.

38:05.984 --> 38:07.319
Hey, Mrs. Larson's

38:07.353 --> 38:09.921
been in a wheelchair
for 20 years.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.358
No way she'd ever
make it down there.

38:16.362 --> 38:19.865
It's like a bunker down here.

38:19.898 --> 38:22.033
Nobody would
ever hear a sound.

38:27.773 --> 38:30.041
We got blood.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.814
Kerry Lynn Palmer
was wearing those

38:35.847 --> 38:38.350
the day she went missing.

38:38.384 --> 38:39.150
[door closes]

38:39.184 --> 38:40.619
(girl)
Please, I want my mom.

38:44.590 --> 38:46.558
Please, I want my mom!
Shut up!

38:46.592 --> 38:47.859
Police!
Get your hands up!

38:47.893 --> 38:48.860
Get 'em up now!

38:48.894 --> 38:50.061
Rickett,
get away from the girl!

38:50.095 --> 38:52.698
(Benson)
Gordon.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.099
There's no way out of this.

38:54.132 --> 38:55.567
Let go of the girl.

38:55.601 --> 38:57.369
Please, he's hurting me!
Ow!

38:57.403 --> 38:58.570
(Stabler)
Rickett, let her go

38:58.604 --> 38:59.805
or I'll kill ya.

38:59.838 --> 39:02.073
You're gonna have
to shoot me.

39:02.107 --> 39:05.477
I swear to God,
I'll kill ya.

39:07.112 --> 39:09.481
It's what you wanted
all these years, isn't it?

39:13.885 --> 39:16.755
Go ahead.
Huh?

39:18.424 --> 39:20.426
Ow!

39:20.459 --> 39:21.460
[girl cries]

39:21.493 --> 39:22.494
[gunshot]

39:22.528 --> 39:23.595
[groans]

39:25.096 --> 39:28.099
[Rickett shouts]

39:38.844 --> 39:40.479
Elliot!

39:40.512 --> 39:43.081
It's over.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.553
Gordon Rickett,
you're under arrest

39:47.586 --> 39:49.120
for the murder
of Kerry Lynn Palmer

39:49.154 --> 39:50.188
and for kidnapping.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.990
You have the right
to remain silent.

39:52.023 --> 39:53.825
You give up that right,
anything you say can and

39:53.859 --> 39:57.095
will be used against you
in a court of law.

39:57.128 --> 39:58.530
You have the right
to an attorney.

39:58.564 --> 40:01.099
If you can't afford one...

40:05.504 --> 40:07.172
[approaching footsteps]

40:07.205 --> 40:10.108
We got there
just in time.

40:10.141 --> 40:13.211
Rickett didn't rape her.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.846
CSU found two types
of blood

40:14.880 --> 40:15.881
in that basement.

40:15.914 --> 40:19.084
One is recent and the other
is likely years old.

40:26.758 --> 40:30.696
Did you think I froze?

40:30.729 --> 40:35.534
Is that why you fired first?

40:35.567 --> 40:38.103
I fired first
'cause you would've killed him.

40:38.136 --> 40:41.640
He deserves to die.

40:41.673 --> 40:45.944
Maybe he does.

40:45.977 --> 40:49.615
But he wanted
you to kill him.

40:49.648 --> 40:50.849
He wanted you

40:50.882 --> 40:52.884
to always remember
that you took his life.

40:52.918 --> 40:54.753
Not because you had to,

40:54.786 --> 40:59.457
but because you were angry.

41:04.896 --> 41:06.998
You wanna get
something to eat?

41:07.032 --> 41:10.502
Come on.

41:15.106 --> 41:17.475
I'm just gonna go home.

41:42.233 --> 41:47.505
[shouting]

42:03.088 --> 42:03.154
