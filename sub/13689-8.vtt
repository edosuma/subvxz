- Welcome to beautiful
New Zealand.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.474
I'm your host, Romeo.

00:07.540 --> 00:09.008
<i>It's cuffing season,</i>

00:09.075 --> 00:12.011
<i>and ten single and sexy</i>
<i>reality stars</i>

00:12.078 --> 00:14.647
<i>are here looking</i>
<i>for their next,</i>

00:14.714 --> 00:16.015
<i>but they didn't realize</i>

00:16.082 --> 00:17.584
<i>that their exes were</i>
<i>joining them too.</i>

00:17.650 --> 00:20.120
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

00:20.186 --> 00:21.955
<i>Each week, we'll alternate</i>

00:22.021 --> 00:24.157
<i>between Ice Week</i>
<i>and Fire Week.</i>

00:24.224 --> 00:27.327
<i>On Fire Weeks, singles</i>
<i>and exes will get to vote</i>

00:27.394 --> 00:29.929
<i>on who deserves a romantic</i>
<i>hot date,</i>

00:29.996 --> 00:31.998
<i>but on Ice Weeks, an ex</i>

00:32.064 --> 00:34.300
<i>who's getting in the way of a</i>
<i>single's next</i>

00:34.367 --> 00:37.404
<i>will be iced out of the chalet</i>
<i>and left in the cold.</i>

00:39.706 --> 00:41.975
<i>This week is Fire Week, baby,</i>

00:42.041 --> 00:46.112
<i>on "Ex on the Beach:</i>
<i>Peak of Love."</i>

00:46.179 --> 00:47.714
{\an8}<i>announcer: And previously,</i>

00:47.781 --> 00:49.048
{\an8}<i>things have been heating up</i>

00:49.115 --> 00:52.452
{\an8}<i>between Nicole</i>
<i>and Daniel's ex, Sydney.</i>

00:52.519 --> 00:54.788
{\an8}<i>Marlon canoodled</i>
<i>with Adore's ex, Jakk,</i>

00:54.854 --> 00:58.525
{\an8}<i>and when Adore found out,</i>
<i>she was like, "Oh, hell no!"</i>

00:58.591 --> 01:00.593
- I'm here to try
to get things with you.

01:00.660 --> 01:02.562
- Well you [bleep] that up,
I'm letting you know that.

01:02.629 --> 01:04.164
<i>announcer: And a surprise</i>
<i>twist,</i>

01:04.230 --> 01:06.032
<i>a single was up</i>
<i>for elimination</i>

01:06.099 --> 01:07.534
<i>at the Ice Ceremony,</i>

01:07.600 --> 01:09.135
<i>leaving the chalet torn</i>

01:09.202 --> 01:11.838
<i>between voting out Daniel</i>
<i>or Allie.</i>

01:11.905 --> 01:14.307
- Allie has four,
and Daniel has four.

01:14.374 --> 01:16.709
<i>announcer: But Daniel's</i>
<i>inability to connect</i>

01:16.776 --> 01:18.111
<i>got him the boot.</i>

01:47.040 --> 01:48.808

01:48.875 --> 01:50.310
{\an8}<i>Now that I know I'm here</i>
<i>to stay,</i>

01:50.376 --> 01:51.778
{\an8}I would like to see

01:51.845 --> 01:54.047
{\an8}a little bit more
of a serious side of Niall.

01:54.113 --> 01:55.849
- Two, three--
- That's not a pin!

01:55.915 --> 01:56.816
I've got you!
- That's a pin.

01:56.883 --> 01:57.817
- My shoulder's up.

01:57.884 --> 01:59.352
<i>- But, romantically,</i>

01:59.419 --> 02:01.287
<i>Niall is the only one</i>
<i>that I have my eyes on.</i>

02:10.697 --> 02:12.499
{\an8}- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, let's go.

02:12.565 --> 02:14.734
{\an8}<i>We've got Adore, drag queen,</i>

02:14.801 --> 02:16.469
{\an8}and Demi, you know,

02:16.536 --> 02:17.704
{\an8}Let's utilize it.

02:17.770 --> 02:18.972
{\an8}<i>Me and Sam should dress up</i>
<i>in drag</i>

02:19.038 --> 02:20.573
{\an8}and have a little
runway competition.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.809
I feel like these men are very
secure with their sexualities

02:22.876 --> 02:23.977
in this house.

02:24.043 --> 02:25.211
You British guys are fun.

02:25.278 --> 02:26.713
I would've never thought
you guys--

02:26.779 --> 02:28.882
- Yeah, honestly, American men
are so masculine-driven

02:28.948 --> 02:31.050
that we don't even want
to [bleep] be around them.

02:31.117 --> 02:32.585
{\an8}<i>male announcer: The entire</i>
<i>chalet</i>

02:32.652 --> 02:34.687
{\an8}<i>needs to stop whatever</i>
<i>the [bleep] they're doing</i>

02:34.754 --> 02:39.526
{\an8}<i>and welcome two of the newest,</i>
<i>hottest queens to Queenstown.</i>

02:39.592 --> 02:40.827
{\an8}- So we brought two exes
in the house

02:40.894 --> 02:42.061
and they're new.

02:42.128 --> 02:44.731
Mine is Tequila Cockingbird
Delano.

02:44.797 --> 02:47.534
- Mine is Orphy Issa Rivers.

02:47.600 --> 02:48.968
[cheering]
So sit back,

02:49.035 --> 02:52.272
have your drink,
and cue the music!

02:52.338 --> 02:55.842
<i>[upbeat pop song]</i>

02:55.909 --> 02:58.745
[all cheering]

02:58.811 --> 03:01.948
<i>- My name is</i>
<i>Tequila Cockingbird,</i>

03:02.015 --> 03:04.317
<i>and my favorite drink's</i>
<i>tequila.</i>

03:04.384 --> 03:06.586
{\an8}<i>I really feel like this is</i>
<i>a new alter ego for me,</i>

03:06.653 --> 03:10.156
{\an8}<i>and I am ready to take Tequila</i>
<i>and show her to the world.</i>

03:10.223 --> 03:12.792
{\an8}I'm the party, 'cause I always
bring the balloons.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.795
{\an8}[screaming]

03:15.862 --> 03:17.764
{\an8}<i>- Tequila Cockingbird, baby.</i>

03:17.830 --> 03:19.933
{\an8}<i>You look fierce, honey.</i>

03:19.999 --> 03:21.334
{\an8}<i>You're doing the damn thing.</i>

03:21.401 --> 03:23.469
{\an8}I think I got a little bit
more attracted to Sam.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.838
{\an8}He kinda got another side
that I haven't seen before.

03:25.905 --> 03:28.274
{\an8}- Orphy Issa Rivers!

03:28.341 --> 03:29.943
{\an8}Get the [bleep] out!

03:30.009 --> 03:33.079
{\an8}[screaming]
- Oh, my God!

03:33.146 --> 03:35.148
{\an8}<i>- Growing up, I forever</i>
<i>dreamed of this moment,</i>

03:35.214 --> 03:36.716
{\an8}<i>and I did not think</i>
<i>for one day</i>

03:36.783 --> 03:38.918
{\an8}<i>that it would be me</i>
<i>walking down that runway,</i>

03:38.985 --> 03:41.487
<i>but for tonight, I have felt</i>
<i>like a princess,</i>

03:41.554 --> 03:44.824
<i>and I feel like I've truly,</i>
<i>truly earned my sisterhood.</i>

03:44.891 --> 03:45.858
<i>[whip snaps]</i>

03:45.925 --> 03:47.427
[cheering and laughing]

03:47.493 --> 03:50.930
- Oi, Callum you gonna [bleep]
me up now?

03:50.997 --> 03:52.498
- Oh, my God.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.802
<i>Both of them have they face</i>

<i>Wig game was laid.</i>

04:10.016 --> 04:12.619
{\an8}- Well done, everyone,

04:12.685 --> 04:13.853
{\an8}Thank you very much.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.622
{\an8}<i>- I've got bangs for days,</i>
<i>tattoos,</i>

04:15.688 --> 04:18.057
{\an8}and I've got cleavage
for every day of the week.

04:18.124 --> 04:19.692

04:27.300 --> 04:31.170
- I really like you.
- I like you too.

04:31.237 --> 04:33.506
- I've said that, but you
just keep, like, [bleep]--

04:33.573 --> 04:35.508
{\an3}- But you can say it,
but it's nice to see it.

04:35.575 --> 04:39.245
{\an8}- Niall and Allie are a very
complicated couple.

04:39.312 --> 04:41.080
{\an8}<i>Don't know whether</i>

{\an8}<i>It's different.</i>

04:44.617 --> 04:45.852
{\an8}Every hour,

{\an8}they're in a completely
different place

04:47.487 --> 04:48.554
{\an8}with each other.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.056
{\an8}Crazy.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.192
- Do you wanna wash your face
and go in the hot tub?

04:53.259 --> 04:55.261
- I kinda don't wanna
wash my face.

04:55.328 --> 04:56.996

- No, okay, I'll wash my face.

04:57.063 --> 04:58.398
Aww.

- How was work?

25:29.427 --> 25:30.662
{\an8}- Good.
Good.

{\an8}- Easy, long--
- I'm super tired right now.

25:32.163 --> 25:34.532

{\an8}Nicole's a huge player,

26:03.995 --> 26:06.598
{\an8}<i>and we would really get</i>

26:33.925 --> 26:36.594
{\an8}because I don't know
what to say with Ashley.

26:36.661 --> 26:38.697
{\an8}Hey.
- [laughs]

26:38.763 --> 26:40.098
{\an8}Whoa.

{\an8}- We're not going that quick
that fast right now.

26:42.033 --> 26:43.301
{\an8}- Oh, [bleep].

26:43.368 --> 26:45.003

26:45.070 --> 26:46.838
{\an8}- This [bleep] sucks!

- I mean, I get it, like,
get to know each other

26:49.040 --> 26:51.643
and, like, hit it off,
but, like--I mean whoa.

26:51.710 --> 26:52.944
Like, talking about spending

26:53.011 --> 26:54.245
the rest of your lives
together?

26:54.312 --> 26:55.714
- No, it wasn't like that.
- That's a lot.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.582
- We're not saying that
that was an--

26:57.649 --> 26:59.417
That wasn't an option, wait,
I--

26:59.484 --> 27:00.518
is this a dream?

27:00.585 --> 27:01.720
- You would consider this
a dream?

27:01.786 --> 27:03.321
I would--maybe a nightmare,
but--

27:03.388 --> 27:05.957
- No, no, I lived my nightmare.
This is definitely a dream.

27:06.024 --> 27:08.126
I'm [bleep] nervous right now.
- Yeah, you're nervous.

27:08.193 --> 27:09.227
- Do we have more wine or no?

27:09.294 --> 27:11.096
- Why are you so nervous
right now?

27:13.064 --> 27:14.766
Like, are you tripping
'cause you did [bleep]

27:14.833 --> 27:16.601
that you probably shouldn't
have done, or, like,

27:16.668 --> 27:18.636
why are you nervous right now?

27:21.106 --> 27:22.674
- I kissed three girls
in the house,

27:22.741 --> 27:25.043
Laurel, Allie, and Sydney.

27:25.110 --> 27:27.979
[laughing nervously]
I don't know what this--

27:28.046 --> 27:30.248
- The crazy thing
is that you're--

27:30.315 --> 27:31.416
you're, like, really good.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.184
{\an8}I get it, like,
we're broken up.

27:33.251 --> 27:35.420
{\an8}<i>She's gonna move on, and,</i>
<i>like, she's total player,</i>

27:35.487 --> 27:37.922
{\an8}but, like, three people?

27:37.989 --> 27:40.158
{\an8}Like, that's a little
excessive, honestly.

27:40.225 --> 27:42.160
It's definitely hard hearing
that you've hooked up

27:42.227 --> 27:43.895
with that many girls.

27:43.962 --> 27:46.064
I mean, I just can't move on
that quickly.

27:46.131 --> 27:48.500
But, I mean, I guess I'm glad
that you could.

27:48.566 --> 27:49.734
- Are you kidding me?

27:49.801 --> 27:52.670
Babe, it's not even like that.

27:52.737 --> 27:54.005
<i>The way that Ashley's</i>
<i>taking the fact</i>

27:54.072 --> 27:55.940
{\an8}that I made out
with three girls

27:56.007 --> 27:58.576
{\an8}<i>is she's bottled inside</i>
<i>the way that she feels.</i>

27:58.643 --> 28:00.678
{\an8}I know she's hurting
ridiculously,

28:00.745 --> 28:03.248
{\an8}and I'm feeling like
I can't take it back.

28:03.314 --> 28:05.116
{\an8}I can't do anything about it.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.485
{\an8}And at this moment,
when I'm looking at Ashley,

28:07.552 --> 28:08.686
{\an8}I wish I could take
everything back,

28:08.753 --> 28:10.755
{\an8}because I never want
to disrespect her

28:10.822 --> 28:12.157
{\an8}in a million years.

28:14.125 --> 28:15.760
{\an3}- I'm just, like,
really confused right now.

28:15.827 --> 28:17.195
I get it, I get it.

28:17.262 --> 28:19.197
It's so [bleep]--it's, like,
easy to get caught up.

28:26.037 --> 28:27.539
{\an8}<i>- The thing that stung me</i>
<i>the most</i>

28:27.605 --> 28:31.709
{\an8}was definitely how much she
still is in love with Ashley.

28:31.776 --> 28:33.311
{\an8}It's like, she looks at Ashley,

28:33.378 --> 28:34.879
{\an8}<i>and she's [bleep] in love</i>
<i>with her,</i>

28:34.946 --> 28:36.948
{\an8}<i>and it's kind of like,</i>

28:37.015 --> 28:39.717
{\an8}"[bleep], man, that's deep,"

{\an8}while you with your main chick?

29:13.518 --> 29:14.752
{\an8}I'm losing my mind right now.

- Hi, La Demi.

29:31.636 --> 29:33.104
{\an8}Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

{\an8}<i>- Seemed like a really nice,</i>

29:37.775 --> 29:39.444
{\an8}She's going out with Nicole,

29:39.511 --> 29:42.547
{\an8}so there must be something
a little bit wrong with her.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.782
{\an8}She can't be all there
in the head.

29:44.849 --> 29:48.653
{\an1}- She's here, and she's someone
I'm in love with,

29:48.720 --> 29:51.689
and I feel like there's things
me and her need to talk about.

29:51.756 --> 29:54.425

<i>whole other side of Nicole.</i>

29:54.492 --> 29:57.795

29:57.862 --> 29:59.631
{\an8}Let's see how your behavior
reacts, sis.

29:59.697 --> 30:01.766
<i>Actions speak louder</i>
<i>than words.</i>

30:01.833 --> 30:04.169
How do you feel about Nicole?

30:04.235 --> 30:06.638
{\an3}- You know, I kind of have
a wall up for me personally,

30:06.704 --> 30:09.474
{\an3}and, like, knowing her,
like, how she is,

30:09.541 --> 30:12.310
{\an3}like, just, you know,
what I've heard about her,

30:12.377 --> 30:15.346
{\an3}like, it makes me put
an even bigger wall up.

30:15.413 --> 30:16.781
You know, we know this girl.

30:16.848 --> 30:18.082
{\an1}She's a [bleep] player
over here.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.484
{\an1}- I'm done
with that reputation.

30:19.551 --> 30:20.852
{\an3}- Yeah?

30:20.919 --> 30:22.620
- Like, I'd never [bleep]
you over like that, ever.

30:22.687 --> 30:24.189
{\an1}- I know, but you just made out
with three girls

30:24.255 --> 30:26.191
{\an1}on this [bleep] show before I
got here, okay?

30:26.257 --> 30:28.660
{\an3}I don't want to get hurt again
so quickly,

{\an3}so I'm definitely gonna
take my time.

30:31.029 --> 30:33.598
{\an8}- It's awkward because I know
that Sydney's to my left,

30:33.665 --> 30:35.266
{\an8}<i>and I know that she's hurting,</i>

30:35.333 --> 30:37.902

30:59.023 --> 31:00.058
<i>- I mean, that depends on you.</i>

31:00.124 --> 31:02.293
I guess, the main thing is

31:02.360 --> 31:03.828
I still want to try
to get to know you,

31:03.895 --> 31:06.264
I still want to see if there's
a connection there,

31:06.331 --> 31:07.832

gonna actually

31:07.899 --> 31:11.236
just, like, let me in.

31:11.302 --> 31:14.005
- Well, I think that I owe you
an apology.

31:14.072 --> 31:15.940
I put up all these red flags
with you

31:16.007 --> 31:17.976
and did not let you in with me

31:18.042 --> 31:19.377
because I just saw a lot
of, like,

31:19.444 --> 31:21.012
dating issues that, like,
I've had.

31:21.079 --> 31:23.081
Honestly, if someone
sat me down and they're like,

31:23.147 --> 31:24.849
"What do you have to say
about Marlon,"

31:24.916 --> 31:27.051
you're gorgeous, handsome.

31:27.118 --> 31:29.020
- Thank you.
- Stupid.

31:29.087 --> 31:30.388
Funny.

31:30.455 --> 31:31.956
I still, like, want to really
get to know you,

31:32.023 --> 31:34.525
and I want to open up
and tell you all about me.

31:34.592 --> 31:35.793
- Yeah, yeah.
- Things that I--

31:35.860 --> 31:37.428
{\an1}- And I want to know
these things, you know?

31:37.495 --> 31:39.063
{\an3}- Things I did not get
to tell you.

31:39.130 --> 31:42.300
{\an8}Marlon, you still did voice
that you have interest in me,

31:42.367 --> 31:43.501
{\an8}<i>and you want to pursue me,</i>

31:43.568 --> 31:46.304
{\an8}and although I've been
so standoffish

31:46.371 --> 31:48.139
{\an8}and pushing you and pushing you
and pushing you,

31:48.206 --> 31:50.708
{\an8}I think it's time to just
accept it,

31:50.775 --> 31:51.976
{\an8}to let the love in.

31:52.043 --> 31:54.078
{\an8}A lot of it did deal with me
closing you out,

31:54.145 --> 31:55.280
{\an8}and I apologize,

31:55.346 --> 31:57.882
{\an8}and I would love
to get to know Marlon.

31:57.949 --> 31:59.751
{\an8}- This is really big for me
just because, like,

31:59.817 --> 32:02.587
{\an8}me and La Demi have finally
got to this crossroad

32:02.654 --> 32:05.356
