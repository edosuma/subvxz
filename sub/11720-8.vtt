KONO:
Where is he?

01:36.279 --> 01:37.746
Where is Adam Noshimuri?

01:37.799 --> 01:39.042
We know you took him.

01:39.043 --> 01:40.343
You know nothing.

01:42.124 --> 01:44.229
I know that if I pull this
trigger, there's a bullet that's

01:44.230 --> 01:46.030
gonna travel
at 1,200 feet per second,

01:46.439 --> 01:49.306
blowing a hole the size
of baseball in your brain,

01:49.308 --> 01:51.242
killing you in a matter
of milliseconds.

01:51.244 --> 01:54.695
Now, taking that into account,
I'm gonna ask you again,

01:54.697 --> 01:56.747
where is Adam?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.317
You'll never see him again.

02:04.662 --> 02:06.129
You killed him?

02:06.131 --> 02:08.164
Is he dead?!

02:09.967 --> 02:11.835
Is he dead?!

02:19.561 --> 02:22.712
If it was up to Kono, she'd put
a bullet in you right now,

02:22.714 --> 02:24.714
but we're gonna do this
the right way.

02:24.716 --> 02:28.485
You're gonna confess
to Adam's murder.

02:28.487 --> 02:30.053
What do you want me
to say?

02:30.055 --> 02:33.357
The truth-- you killed him.

02:33.359 --> 02:34.575
I wanted Adam dead...

02:34.577 --> 02:37.828
but out of respect
for his father, I let him go.

02:37.830 --> 02:40.163
You're lying.
Am I?

02:40.165 --> 02:42.366
I helped Adam fake

02:42.368 --> 02:44.785
his death
so he could disappear.

02:44.787 --> 02:48.405
If he's smart, he'll
never show his face again.

02:48.407 --> 02:50.573
If you are smart,

02:50.575 --> 02:54.211
you'll let this go.

02:58.182 --> 02:59.716
Yeah, copy that.

03:00.768 --> 03:02.469
All right, Steve
and Catherine took Sato

03:02.471 --> 03:03.854
to the drop point.

03:19.154 --> 03:20.938
I'm gonna go find him.

Michael Noshimuri's allies

03:25.610 --> 03:27.911
You don't have
to run anymore.

03:27.913 --> 03:29.379
But if you go

03:29.381 --> 03:32.582
trying to look for him,
you both become targets again.

03:34.886 --> 03:38.138
You once told me
to follow my heart.

03:38.140 --> 03:40.090
That's what I'm gonna go do.

03:43.461 --> 03:46.229
Just be careful, all right?

two guys from Five-O

12:25.184 --> 12:27.068

12:27.436 --> 12:28.569
Okay.

12:28.571 --> 12:30.187

12:30.189 --> 12:32.023
Well, you probably could've
three months ago, right,

12:32.025 --> 12:33.274

12:33.276 --> 12:35.192

would've slipped your mind.

12:35.194 --> 12:36.844
All right, come on, enough
chitchat. Let's go, let's go.

12:36.846 --> 12:39.530

Yeah, please.

wonders for one day.

12:41.918 --> 12:45.252

12:45.254 --> 12:47.455
You know that, right?

12:49.624 --> 12:52.543

of new program

12:52.545 --> 12:53.761
for unpaid parking tickets?

12:53.763 --> 12:56.914
It's just seems
a little aggressive.

12:56.916 --> 13:00.968
Take your time picking
a shirt there, Ian.

13:00.970 --> 13:02.136
Take your time.

13:02.138 --> 13:03.437
(sniffs)

13:03.439 --> 13:04.355
That's disgusting.

13:04.357 --> 13:05.606
Okay, he's riding with you.

13:05.608 --> 13:06.891
Me?

13:06.893 --> 13:08.258
You got XM by any chance?

13:08.260 --> 13:09.527
(chuckles)

13:09.529 --> 13:10.761
STEVE:
You got XM?

13:10.763 --> 13:13.647
This day just keeps getting
better and better.

13:17.102 --> 13:18.452
So, if I'm riding with you,

13:18.454 --> 13:19.820
how am I getting back here?

13:19.822 --> 13:22.106
Why don't you have one of
bravo team come pick you up?

13:22.108 --> 13:23.908
(chuckles) Well
none of them live in Hawaii.

13:23.910 --> 13:25.326
Well, you're a smart kid, Ian.

13:25.328 --> 13:26.794
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

13:26.796 --> 13:28.329
(automatic gunfire)

13:28.331 --> 13:29.463
Get down!

13:29.465 --> 13:30.965
(groaning)

13:30.967 --> 13:32.633
(gunfire continues)

13:33.785 --> 13:35.936
Ian!

13:35.938 --> 13:38.122
Who are these guys?
I don't know.

13:38.124 --> 13:39.473
I don't know!

13:39.475 --> 13:40.641
I don't know!

13:41.810 --> 13:43.811
Move it!

13:57.308 --> 13:59.326
I'm out!

13:59.328 --> 14:00.911
I got one round left!

14:01.997 --> 14:03.831
You're hit!

14:05.367 --> 14:08.485
(gunfire stops)

14:12.824 --> 14:14.625
Hey. (snapping)

14:15.443 --> 14:16.877
We got to cut them off

14:16.879 --> 14:19.847
before they pin us down.

14:19.849 --> 14:21.432
I'm going out the back.

14:21.434 --> 14:22.883
You take care of the kid.

14:22.885 --> 14:24.135
All right?
All right, stay down.

14:24.137 --> 14:25.853
Go!
I'm right behind you.

14:44.289 --> 14:46.457
(glass crunches)

14:48.994 --> 14:51.028
(grunting)

14:58.587 --> 14:59.820
(grunting continues)

15:14.552 --> 15:15.886
(gunshot)

15:15.888 --> 15:17.605
(grunting)

15:23.028 --> 15:24.612
(gunshots, screams)

15:28.333 --> 15:29.533
(gunshots)

15:31.836 --> 15:33.704
Get up, get up.
No, no, no.

15:33.706 --> 15:36.006
IAN:
Help! Help me!

15:36.008 --> 15:37.791
Help!

15:38.877 --> 15:40.361
Help me!

15:40.363 --> 15:42.196
Help! Help me!

15:48.386 --> 15:50.754
(tires squealing)

15:53.058 --> 15:55.759
Damn it!

15:55.761 --> 15:57.427
(sighs)

16:35.008 --> 16:36.475
Got it.

16:41.881 --> 16:43.316
GROVER:
All right.

16:43.318 --> 16:44.567
This should help
stop the bleeding.

16:44.569 --> 16:46.435
No, no, no,
it's nothing, it's nothing.

16:46.437 --> 16:48.321
That nothing you got
is leaking pretty good.

16:48.323 --> 16:50.740
I'm fine.
You know what, fine.

16:50.742 --> 16:53.192
Go ahead, pass out, you stubborn
son of a bitch; I don't care.

16:53.194 --> 16:54.577
You know what, give it, give it.

16:54.579 --> 16:55.745
Okay?

16:55.747 --> 16:57.163
Here, here, okay?

17:01.535 --> 17:03.035
(groans)
Yeah.

17:03.037 --> 17:04.337
Hurt, don't it?

17:04.339 --> 17:05.704
Yeah.

17:05.707 --> 17:08.674
(panting)

17:14.297 --> 17:16.682
Hey, Grover, can you help me
tie this tourniquet?

17:16.684 --> 17:19.135
Sure, buddy, no problem.

17:19.137 --> 17:20.185
Okay.

17:20.188 --> 17:22.521
Now, why do you
suppose these guys

17:22.522 --> 17:24.022
would want to kidnap a
knucklehead like Ian?

17:24.025 --> 17:26.090
(panting)

17:26.093 --> 17:27.425
I have no idea.

17:27.428 --> 17:29.928
We got to get in touch with
the HPD as soon as possible.

17:29.930 --> 17:31.530
Well, the kid's got no landline,

17:31.532 --> 17:33.232
and our cell service
is dead up here.

17:33.234 --> 17:34.817
We got to move.

17:46.446 --> 17:47.713
Damn it!

17:48.965 --> 17:51.784
What's wrong?

17:51.786 --> 17:52.951
Was I talking to you?

17:52.953 --> 17:54.470
You have
a very angry disposition,

17:54.472 --> 17:55.721
you know that?

17:55.723 --> 17:56.972
Oh, well,

17:56.974 --> 18:00.059
maybe it's 'cause I'm with you.

18:04.064 --> 18:05.297
Would you stop doing that?

18:05.299 --> 18:07.149
You look like a flying giraffe.

18:07.151 --> 18:09.635
How the hell can there be
no cell reception up here?

18:09.637 --> 18:11.570
Welcome to Waimanalo.

18:14.274 --> 18:16.308
You know, McGarrett,
I got to ask you,

18:16.310 --> 18:18.844
why is it that you are
the constant variable

18:18.846 --> 18:20.596
in every pile of crap I step in?

18:20.598 --> 18:22.298
Oh, that's good;
this is my fault.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.266
I'm just calling it
like I see it, man.

18:24.268 --> 18:26.786
Wherever you go,
trouble follows.

18:26.788 --> 18:28.537
That's funny coming from you.

18:28.539 --> 18:31.173
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

18:31.175 --> 18:33.158
You don't think
I did my homework, huh?

18:33.160 --> 18:35.044
HPD hires a new SWAT commander,

18:35.046 --> 18:36.962
you don't thin
I'm gonna check you out?

18:36.964 --> 18:39.131
It's not every day
that a 20-year vet

18:39.133 --> 18:40.349
on track
to becoming superintendent

18:40.351 --> 18:43.018
up and moves to a rock
in the middle of the Pacific.

18:44.304 --> 18:46.272
Unless he's running
from something.

18:46.274 --> 18:47.690
Oh, by night,
he's a Navy SEAL,

18:47.692 --> 18:48.891
by day, he's a shrink.

18:48.893 --> 18:50.309
Just want to know
who I'm working with, man.

18:50.311 --> 18:52.728
Hey, I show up for
work, I do my job.

18:52.730 --> 18:55.481
That all you need to know.

18:55.483 --> 18:57.399
What?
Gasoline.

18:57.401 --> 18:58.501
We must have hit

18:58.503 --> 19:00.853
their fuel tank.

19:01.688 --> 19:03.956
STEVE:
That's their car.

19:14.384 --> 19:16.535
Clear.

19:19.556 --> 19:21.707
(sniffing)
You smell that?

19:21.709 --> 19:23.008
Tear gas.

19:23.010 --> 19:24.310
Yeah, and that pink stain

19:24.312 --> 19:25.478
is from a dye pack.

19:25.480 --> 19:26.680
I think these guys hit a bank.

19:26.681 --> 19:27.897
From the looks of things,

19:27.899 --> 19:29.064
not too long ago.

19:29.066 --> 19:30.983
What the hell did this kid
get himself into?

19:33.069 --> 19:35.149
Well, they're on foot;
they couldn't have gotten far.

19:35.689 --> 19:37.356
(rustling, whinnying)

19:40.577 --> 19:42.778
Over there.

19:58.428 --> 19:59.929
Hey! Hey!

19:59.931 --> 20:02.047
(gunshots)

20:03.717 --> 20:05.935
(horse snorts)

20:08.588 --> 20:09.772
(whinnying)

20:09.774 --> 20:10.923
Hey!

20:10.925 --> 20:13.692
Hey! Can you even ride?

20:13.694 --> 20:16.045
Can you? Cha!

20:16.047 --> 20:18.597
Cha!

20:22.953 --> 20:24.269
There they are!

20:24.271 --> 20:25.538
Hyah!

20:43.122 --> 20:44.673
McGarrett, where the
hell are we going?

20:44.675 --> 20:45.975
We're gonna cut them off!

21:02.359 --> 21:04.076
There they are!

21:04.078 --> 21:05.778
Cha!

21:09.482 --> 21:12.001
(gunshots)

21:16.640 --> 21:18.490
They ain't stopping!

21:18.492 --> 21:19.758
I can see that.

21:27.467 --> 21:30.335
(phone rings)
CHIN: <i>Steve?</i>

21:30.337 --> 21:31.887
Chin, listen.

21:31.889 --> 21:33.055
Put out and APB on Ian Wright.

21:33.057 --> 21:35.307
Is this the kid
with the parking tickets?

21:35.309 --> 21:36.475
Yeah, he was kidnapped.

21:36.477 --> 21:38.510
The people who took him
were last seen headed north

21:38.512 --> 21:39.695
on Kalanianaole Highway.

21:39.697 --> 21:41.513
They're in a gold
Nissan Pathfinder.

21:41.515 --> 21:45.517
License plate is echo-
three-four-tango-romeo-one.

21:45.519 --> 21:46.702
All right, I'm on it.

21:46.704 --> 21:47.953
All right, and hey,

21:47.955 --> 21:49.204
send a CSU up to
that Waimanalo house.

21:49.206 --> 21:50.689
All right, have them process
the place.

21:50.691 --> 21:53.125
I want to know everything there
is to know about Ian Wright.

21:53.127 --> 21:54.627
Just a flesh wound, Commander.

21:54.629 --> 21:55.527
You're all set.

21:55.529 --> 21:57.162
Steve, it's Cath. Are you okay?

21:57.164 --> 21:58.530
Yeah, I am. Don't worry.

21:58.532 --> 22:00.416
Listen, check your e-mail,
Catherine.

22:00.418 --> 22:01.483
I just sent you photographs
of fingerprints

22:01.485 --> 22:02.835
of the two shooters
we just took down.

22:02.837 --> 22:04.036
We need to get their I.D.'s,

22:04.038 --> 22:05.203
we need to figure out
what they wanted with Ian.

22:05.205 --> 22:06.204
Okay? Call me

22:06.206 --> 22:07.172
when you got something.

22:07.174 --> 22:08.340
All right,
I'll call you back.

22:08.342 --> 22:09.642
Listen, I just got off
with one of my guys.

22:09.644 --> 22:11.510
He says there's only
one bank in the area

22:11.512 --> 22:12.878
that uses tear gas
in their dye packs.

22:12.880 --> 22:14.313
Let's go.

22:17.100 --> 22:19.184
WOMAN:
<i>Gentlemen...</i>

22:19.186 --> 22:21.186
I assure you
there's been no robbery.

22:21.188 --> 22:22.321
See? There's a live feed

22:22.323 --> 22:24.389
running around the clock.
It's all there.

22:25.659 --> 22:26.992
But if you insist...

22:26.994 --> 22:28.944
We insist.

23:01.121 --> 23:03.461
CHIN: Ran the prints
on your two dead shooters.

23:03.821 --> 23:06.128
Turns out, they were part
of a four-man stick-up crew

23:06.129 --> 23:07.879
focusing primarily on banks.

23:07.881 --> 23:09.213
All were released
from FDC Honolulu

23:09.215 --> 23:11.632
within the last three months.

23:11.634 --> 23:12.917
These...

23:12.919 --> 23:13.951
were the other two.

23:13.953 --> 23:16.804
Kurt Simon and Luke Davis.

23:16.806 --> 23:18.055
Those are the two guys
that grabbed Ian.

23:18.057 --> 23:19.623
Okay, all right, this
doesn't make any sense.

23:19.625 --> 23:21.058
These guys are
nickel and dime.

23:21.060 --> 23:23.427
It took an expert hacker
to pull off that bank job.

23:24.796 --> 23:26.681
Why do I suddenly
get the feeling

23:26.683 --> 23:28.933
that Ian's
not your average knucklehead?

23:28.935 --> 23:30.134
Because he isn't.

23:30.136 --> 23:31.185
This kid's been living

23:31.187 --> 23:34.605
on his own since he
was 18 years old.

23:34.607 --> 23:35.489
His parents are
both deceased.

23:35.491 --> 23:36.908
And up until last semester,

23:36.910 --> 23:39.777
he was a computer science
major at O'ahu State.

23:39.779 --> 23:41.145
What happen? He drop out?
Expelled.

23:41.147 --> 23:43.364
He hacked into the university's
computer system,

23:43.366 --> 23:45.416
stole final exams,
and then got caught

23:45.418 --> 23:46.817
selling them
to the entire student body.

23:46.819 --> 23:48.502
CSU found a server

23:48.504 --> 23:50.538
at his house.

23:50.540 --> 23:51.872
Toast is trying
to recover any data,

23:51.874 --> 23:52.873
but he's having trouble

23:52.875 --> 23:54.292
because it's encrypted

23:54.294 --> 23:55.927
using NSA-level firewalls.

23:55.929 --> 23:57.878
All right, so our bank
robbers hired Ian

23:57.880 --> 23:59.163
to help pull off this heist.

23:59.165 --> 24:01.549
Uh, the kid helped them get
past the security systems.

24:01.551 --> 24:02.800
They go in, grab the cash.

24:02.802 --> 24:04.885
Maybe that's why
they were going to his place.

24:04.887 --> 24:06.354
To split up the money.

24:06.356 --> 24:07.521
I don't think so.

24:07.523 --> 24:08.973
If it was about everybody
getting their share,

24:08.975 --> 24:10.308
they would've hightailed
it out of there

24:10.310 --> 24:11.842
the minute they saw our cars.

24:11.844 --> 24:12.810
I think you're right.

24:12.812 --> 24:15.029
They need Ian
for something else.

24:15.031 --> 24:16.981
(cell phone ringing)

24:16.983 --> 24:18.182
Lieutenant Kelly.

24:21.820 --> 24:23.788
Yeah, good work. Thanks.

24:23.790 --> 24:25.323
That was HPD.

24:25.325 --> 24:27.792
They found our suspects
stolen vehicle in a parking lot

24:27.794 --> 24:29.076
in Maunalua Valley.

24:29.078 --> 24:30.711
They searched the area,
didn't find the robbers

24:30.713 --> 24:32.546
or no sign of Ian.

24:32.548 --> 24:33.831
Well, did they happen
to find a pink laptop.

24:33.833 --> 24:35.499
With the Chicago skyline on it?

24:35.501 --> 24:37.418
The car was empty. Why?

24:37.420 --> 24:38.369
Damn it.

24:38.371 --> 24:40.004
They stole your computer?

24:40.006 --> 24:42.873
You, uh, you didn't think that
was important to mention to us?

24:42.875 --> 24:44.091
Well, I'm mentioning it now.

24:44.093 --> 24:45.476
And it's not my computer anyway.

24:45.478 --> 24:46.710
It's my daughter's.
I don't care

24:46.712 --> 24:48.346
whose computer it is.

24:48.348 --> 24:49.380
Ian's a hacker.

24:49.382 --> 24:51.065
If he stole it,
it's now a weapon.

24:51.067 --> 24:52.433
All right!
All right, McGarrett.

24:52.435 --> 24:53.517
You're right.

24:53.519 --> 24:54.885
I should've
mentioned it earlier.

24:54.887 --> 24:57.321
It's just that...
Just that what?

24:59.658 --> 25:01.492
Look, man.

25:01.494 --> 25:03.727
Do you know I caught my daughter
playing show-and-tell

25:03.729 --> 25:06.063
with some little punk
online this morning?

25:07.616 --> 25:10.584
Wh-What's that look?
What-what? You think it's funny?

25:10.586 --> 25:12.420
I'm-I'm not laughing.
(Chin laughs)

25:12.422 --> 25:13.621
Oh, you, too, huh?
Oh, I see.

25:13.623 --> 25:15.122
Neither one of you have kids.
That's all right.

25:15.124 --> 25:17.241
Laugh it up.
Your day's coming.

25:17.243 --> 25:18.426
Ah, it's hormones
and technology.

25:18.428 --> 25:19.860
Tell me about it.

25:19.862 --> 25:21.679
Every father's
worst damn nightmare.

25:21.681 --> 25:23.998
You know what? I can track
your daughter's laptop.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.100
If it comes online,
we can locate it.

25:26.102 --> 25:28.269
Okay, look,
last time I checked,

25:28.271 --> 25:30.137
computer geeks and bank
robbers don't exactly

25:30.139 --> 25:31.389
run in the same circles.

25:31.391 --> 25:33.357
I'm thinking somebody had
to make an introduction.

25:33.359 --> 25:34.758
I'm thinking you're right.

25:34.760 --> 25:37.094
(computer buzzes)
Check this out.

25:37.096 --> 25:38.979
(computer buzzes)

25:38.981 --> 25:40.197
No.

25:41.533 --> 25:43.117
(computer buzzes)
Eh.

25:43.119 --> 25:44.285
(computer whooshes)

25:44.287 --> 25:45.486
Huh.

25:45.488 --> 25:47.538
You'll get the hang of it,
newbie.

25:47.540 --> 25:50.241
Okay, so much
for my dramatic entrance.

25:50.243 --> 25:52.960
All right,
here we have Eli Diamond.

25:52.962 --> 25:54.662
He's a defense attorney.

25:54.664 --> 25:57.665
Former clients include our
bank robbers and Ian Wright.

25:57.667 --> 25:59.750
Repped Ian when O'ahu
State pressed charges

25:59.752 --> 26:01.618
for hacking their system.

26:01.620 --> 26:03.838
So, Eli Diamond
played matchmaker.

26:03.840 --> 26:05.506
Where is he?

26:05.508 --> 26:07.475
House arrest.
Awaiting trial for tax evasion.

26:07.477 --> 26:09.643
And, uh, GPS ankle bracelet

26:09.645 --> 26:11.628
puts him there right now.

26:18.437 --> 26:20.071
Eli Diamond, Five-O!

26:29.698 --> 26:30.948
I got blood!

26:43.378 --> 26:44.378
Clear.

26:44.380 --> 26:46.630
McGarrett!

26:55.974 --> 26:57.308
Well.

26:57.310 --> 27:00.144
Looks like Eli Diamond
made parole.

27:00.146 --> 27:03.114
STEVE: <i>Chin, put out an APB</i>
<i>on Eli Diamond.</i>

27:03.116 --> 27:04.565
And track his car.
Looks like he's making

27:04.567 --> 27:05.783
a run for it.

27:08.870 --> 27:12.072
All right, I got Diamond's car
at Ala Wai Marina.

27:12.074 --> 27:13.824
And get this.

27:13.826 --> 27:15.910
He's got a boat.

27:15.912 --> 27:17.378
(tires screeching)

27:17.380 --> 27:18.913
STEVE:
<i>Five-O!</i>

27:18.915 --> 27:20.047
Freeze! Now!
Freeze!

27:20.049 --> 27:21.182
Show me your hands.

27:21.184 --> 27:22.383
Hands behind your head.

27:22.385 --> 27:23.851
Interlock your fingers
right now.

27:23.853 --> 27:25.085
Interlock your fingers.

27:25.087 --> 27:26.637
Interlock your fingers.
Stay down!

27:26.639 --> 27:29.423
Stay down, stay down!

27:32.511 --> 27:35.162
Ian?

27:35.164 --> 27:36.680
Ian!

27:36.682 --> 27:37.848
(groans)

27:40.051 --> 27:42.019
Ian's not here.

27:43.655 --> 27:45.840
GROVER:
<i>Where the hell is he?</i>

27:48.360 --> 27:51.195
STEVE:
Is he alive?

27:51.197 --> 27:53.364
Answer the question!

27:55.750 --> 27:58.085
Okay, listen.

27:58.087 --> 27:59.203
Diamond told us

27:59.205 --> 28:00.621
you were supposed to bring Ian

28:00.623 --> 28:01.738
to disable the ankle bracelet.

28:01.740 --> 28:03.674
You showed up without him. Why?

28:05.093 --> 28:08.412
You know, it's a funny thing
about... words.

28:08.414 --> 28:11.882
See, 99% of the species,

28:11.884 --> 28:14.051
they get along
without using them.

28:14.053 --> 28:17.254
Me personally?

28:17.256 --> 28:20.891
Oh, I'm a big fan
of non-verbal communication.

28:20.893 --> 28:23.060
You feel me?

28:24.362 --> 28:27.281
Threaten me all you want.

28:27.283 --> 28:29.867
If I talk...

28:29.869 --> 28:32.486
I'm a dead man.
Who are you afraid of?

28:32.488 --> 28:33.404
You can't be afraid of Diamond.

28:33.406 --> 28:35.039
We have him.

28:41.246 --> 28:42.830
Come with me.

28:44.633 --> 28:45.916
(buzzer sounds)

28:46.784 --> 28:48.569
There was only one other person

28:48.571 --> 28:51.138
involved in this.

28:51.140 --> 28:52.339
All right, we got
this all wrong.

28:52.341 --> 28:54.208
The bank robbers
didn't hire Ian.

28:54.210 --> 28:55.910
Ian hired them.

28:55.912 --> 28:57.561
Diamond makes
the introductions.

28:57.563 --> 29:00.064
Ian promises to boost him
from his ankle bracelet.

29:00.066 --> 29:01.181
Everybody wins.

29:01.183 --> 29:03.267
Until we showed up.

29:03.269 --> 29:04.602
Ian knew it wouldn't take long
to figure out

29:04.604 --> 29:06.070
Diamond was the connection
between him and the crew.

29:06.072 --> 29:07.638
So he splits.
(cell phone ringing)

29:07.640 --> 29:08.606
Leaves Diamond no choice

29:08.608 --> 29:11.075
but to hack off his own foot.

29:11.077 --> 29:12.243
This kid played us.

29:12.245 --> 29:13.410
Yeah?

29:14.613 --> 29:17.164
Yeah, we're on the way.

29:17.166 --> 29:18.832
Toast broke the encryption
on Ian's server.

29:18.834 --> 29:21.001
Looks like he's been planning
this bank robbery

29:21.003 --> 29:22.336
for about six months,

29:22.338 --> 29:24.004
judging from the series
of wire transfers.

29:24.006 --> 29:26.423
You know, this kid has
millions of dollars

29:26.425 --> 29:27.758
in an offshore account.

29:27.760 --> 29:30.177
Money that we traced back
to terrorist organizations.

29:30.179 --> 29:31.929
The dates correspond
with cyber attacks

29:31.931 --> 29:33.013
on a factory in Pune

29:33.015 --> 29:35.699
and a power plant in Beijing.

29:35.701 --> 29:36.833
So Ian was selling his skills

29:36.835 --> 29:37.834
to the highest bidder.

29:37.836 --> 29:39.353
Well, that explains
why our suspect

29:39.355 --> 29:40.688
is so afraid of him.

29:40.690 --> 29:43.223
Kid's lined himself up
with some pretty nasty fanatics.

29:43.225 --> 29:45.359
CATHERINE:
Well, it gets worse.

29:45.361 --> 29:47.111
The company that designed
the bank's security system?

29:47.113 --> 29:48.512
They just won
a government contract

29:48.514 --> 29:49.947
to update all U.S. embassies

29:49.949 --> 29:51.615
with the same technology.

29:54.185 --> 29:55.986
This was never
about the bank robbery for Ian.

29:55.988 --> 29:57.571
He was testing the system.

29:57.573 --> 30:00.374
Catherine, contact
the state department, tell them

30:00.376 --> 30:01.858
their security's compromised.
Copy that.

30:01.860 --> 30:03.377
CHIN: Grover.
Yeah?

30:03.379 --> 30:05.879
Your daughter's laptop
just came online.

30:05.881 --> 30:06.880
Where is it?

30:06.882 --> 30:09.166
♪

30:16.174 --> 30:18.459
♪

30:18.461 --> 30:20.644
Got him!

30:27.519 --> 30:30.771
Ian Wright.

30:30.773 --> 30:32.940
Crocket and Tubbs.

30:32.942 --> 30:34.942
I knew you'd get my message.

30:34.944 --> 30:36.560
Get up.

30:36.562 --> 30:38.162
Get up.

30:38.164 --> 30:39.446
Hands behind your head,
interlock your fingers,

30:39.448 --> 30:40.447
turn around.

30:40.449 --> 30:42.666
Turn around.

30:43.918 --> 30:45.919
Cross your legs.
You don't want to do that.

30:45.921 --> 30:47.871
Oh, believe me.

30:47.873 --> 30:49.757
I really want to do this.

30:57.766 --> 30:59.049
McGarrett?

30:59.051 --> 31:00.300
What?

31:04.856 --> 31:08.942
IAN: You think I brought you here
without a plan.

31:10.061 --> 31:13.930
That is Flight 408
out of Los Angeles.

31:13.932 --> 31:15.265
305 passengers,

31:15.267 --> 31:18.235
eight crew, two pilots.

31:18.237 --> 31:21.405
Scheduled to land here in
Honolulu in just over two hours.

31:21.407 --> 31:23.874
See, we've advanced
so far technologically,

31:23.876 --> 31:25.409
we're no longer satisfied
with a simple,

31:25.411 --> 31:27.211
"Uh, your flight's on time."

31:27.213 --> 31:29.279
No, see we want
to know every detail.

31:29.281 --> 31:30.798
And we want to know it now.

31:30.800 --> 31:33.550
You know what makes
all that possible?

31:33.552 --> 31:35.753
GPS.

31:37.756 --> 31:39.623
Most people don't realize
it was created

31:39.625 --> 31:42.342
by the department of defense
during the Cold War as a weapon.

31:42.344 --> 31:44.428
It allowed our subs
to get an accurate fix

31:44.430 --> 31:45.846
on their target
before firing off a missile.

31:45.848 --> 31:48.015
But when the government opened
it up to civilian use,

31:48.017 --> 31:49.183
they cheaped out.

31:49.185 --> 31:50.434
See, they didn't want
to spend the cash

31:50.436 --> 31:52.469
to encrypt civilian GPS
like they did military.

31:52.471 --> 31:54.655
Which means

31:54.657 --> 31:57.074
that everything gets its data
from civilian GPS

31:57.076 --> 31:59.109
is vulnerable to be hacked.

31:59.111 --> 32:01.578
Shipping lanes, trains,

32:01.580 --> 32:04.147
car navigation,

32:04.149 --> 32:06.366
and of course...

32:06.368 --> 32:08.318
commercial airlines.

32:08.320 --> 32:10.087
What the hell
have you done, Ian?

32:10.089 --> 32:12.489
It's not what I've done,
Commander.

32:12.491 --> 32:15.375
It's what I will do.

32:15.377 --> 32:19.162
I have control of Flight 408.

32:19.164 --> 32:21.665
If you don't do
exactly what I say,

32:21.667 --> 32:25.102
I will drop it in the ocean.

32:37.061 --> 32:39.229
There's a flight leaving
for Pago Pago in 30 minutes.

32:39.231 --> 32:40.614
Once I've landed

32:40.616 --> 32:42.749
and I know I'm not being
followed, I'll send instructions

32:42.751 --> 32:44.284
on how to get back control
of Flight 408.

32:44.286 --> 32:46.286
I'm not putting you on a plane
with passengers, Ian.

32:46.288 --> 32:48.371
Son, we already have your
money from the robbery.

32:48.373 --> 32:50.507
We know about the embassies.
There's no play here.

32:50.509 --> 32:52.125
You just need to stop this.

32:52.127 --> 32:53.743
And we'll try to make a deal.

32:53.745 --> 32:55.212
A deal?

32:55.214 --> 32:56.429
I've committed acts of treason.

32:56.431 --> 32:57.747
There won't be any deals.

32:57.749 --> 32:59.415
It's 300 people...
You got to stop this.

32:59.417 --> 33:00.684
No chance.

33:00.686 --> 33:02.669
(grunts)

33:02.671 --> 33:04.137
Turn it off.

33:04.139 --> 33:05.272
You think I'm stupid?

33:05.274 --> 33:06.773
The computer running the hack
is somewhere else.

33:06.775 --> 33:08.024
This one just
lets me keep

33:08.026 --> 33:09.776
an eye on it.
GROVER: There's got to be

33:09.778 --> 33:11.278
another way
to shut this thing off.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.529
Yeah, of course
there is.

33:12.531 --> 33:14.698
But it requires you
putting me on that plane.

33:18.452 --> 33:20.603
Where's the other
computer, Ian?

33:20.605 --> 33:22.239
Where's the
other computer?

33:22.241 --> 33:24.157
You just don't get it, do you?

33:24.159 --> 33:25.742
This is speed chess, gentlemen.

33:25.744 --> 33:27.077
And you were checkmated

33:27.079 --> 33:28.628
15 moves ago.

33:28.630 --> 33:31.715
Now, put me on that plane
or 300 people are going to die.

33:31.717 --> 33:32.999
(siren wails,
vehicle approaches)

33:33.001 --> 33:34.718
(siren stops)

33:40.224 --> 33:41.474
What did the
tower say?

33:41.476 --> 33:43.410
They confirmed
that flight 408's been hacked.

33:43.412 --> 33:44.778
Ian's tricked
the plane's GPS

33:44.780 --> 33:46.746
into thinking that they're
on course when they're not.

33:46.748 --> 33:48.064
It's called spoofing.

33:48.066 --> 33:50.517
Now, if that plane stays
on its current path,

33:50.519 --> 33:51.902
they're going to be
so far out

33:51.904 --> 33:53.469
over the ocean by the time
they realize something's wrong,

33:53.471 --> 33:55.405
they're not going to have
enough fuel to land.

33:55.407 --> 33:57.490
You got to call the pilot
and get them back on course.

33:57.492 --> 33:59.192
We can't. The tower's lost
communication with the plane.

33:59.194 --> 34:00.977
You get back to that tower, okay?
(cell phone ringing)

34:00.979 --> 34:02.412
Keep trying to get in touch
with that plane.

34:02.414 --> 34:03.363
I want constant updates.

34:03.365 --> 34:04.364
Copy.

34:04.366 --> 34:05.615
Catherine.

34:05.617 --> 34:07.534
Steve, so I just reached out
to Naval Intelligence.

34:07.536 --> 34:08.784
They've been
developing protocols

34:08.786 --> 34:10.754
to defend against these type
of cyber attacks.

34:10.755 --> 34:12.873
Okay, good.
What's their course of action?

34:12.875 --> 34:14.123
Jamming the attack
with software.

34:14.126 --> 34:15.792
Now, they're sending me
a zip file,

34:15.793 --> 34:17.060
but it's only a prototype,

34:17.062 --> 34:19.045
and it's only been tested
on simulated attacks.

34:19.047 --> 34:20.830
We need to upload it
to Ian's computer

34:20.831 --> 34:22.498
and hopefully it'll
interrupt the signal.

34:22.500 --> 34:23.766
We can't do that, okay?

34:23.768 --> 34:25.135
The computer running
the attack is not here.

34:25.137 --> 34:26.168
We don't know where that is.

34:26.170 --> 34:27.721
He's monitoring it
from this laptop.

34:27.723 --> 34:29.356
All right. That's okay
because that means

34:29.358 --> 34:30.607
the two computers are connected.

34:30.609 --> 34:33.193
So... we already have a tap
on Grover's laptop,

34:33.195 --> 34:35.195
so all we need to do
is trace the connection

34:35.197 --> 34:38.114
back to the computer
that's running the attack.

34:42.469 --> 34:43.652
Cath, you got something?

34:43.655 --> 34:45.038
He scrambled the signal, Steve.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.873
I'm staring at about
a hundred different

34:46.875 --> 34:47.908
IP addresses on O'ahu right now.

34:47.909 --> 34:48.958
I mean, one of them

34:48.960 --> 34:50.010
is the location, but this is

34:50.012 --> 34:51.360
going to take days
to narrow down.

34:51.362 --> 34:52.462
We don't have days.

34:52.464 --> 34:53.797
Catherine, we have minutes.

34:53.799 --> 34:56.081
Put every resource
we have on this.

34:57.802 --> 34:59.753
We're screwed, aren't we?

35:00.588 --> 35:02.088
300 lives.

35:02.090 --> 35:03.640
I don't think
we have a choice

35:03.642 --> 35:05.041
but to put Ian on this plane.

35:05.043 --> 35:07.177
I think that's the
right decision.

35:08.062 --> 35:09.879
Thank you.

35:11.482 --> 35:13.716
All right, now, so we got 20
minutes before we got to put

35:13.718 --> 35:15.435
this kid on a flight.
Maybe there's some way

35:15.437 --> 35:18.021
we can find where he's
hidden that other computer.

35:18.023 --> 35:19.022
HPD has his server.

35:19.024 --> 35:20.657
I mean, where else
is he going to go

35:20.659 --> 35:21.775
to pull this off?

35:21.777 --> 35:23.860
Someplace familiar,
someplace he would trust.

35:23.862 --> 35:25.728
Problem is, we have
no intel on this guy

35:25.730 --> 35:27.897
except that he plays Xbox
and he gets parking tickets.

35:27.899 --> 35:29.399
He gets parking tick...

35:29.401 --> 35:30.543
Hey, you still got
that arrest warrant?

35:30.568 --> 35:32.419
Yeah.

35:32.420 --> 35:34.237
Let me see that.

35:35.256 --> 35:38.124
All right,
he got six parking tickets

35:38.126 --> 35:40.510
in three months,
all in west O'ahu.

35:40.512 --> 35:43.346
You recognize any
of these addresses?

35:43.348 --> 35:45.715
These are all
near O'ahu State.

35:47.268 --> 35:49.252
Someplace familiar.

35:49.254 --> 35:51.137
Hey, Cath.

35:51.139 --> 35:53.223
Check out the IP addresses
we got.

35:53.225 --> 35:55.158
See if any of them
is a location near O'ahu State.

35:55.160 --> 35:58.378
Somewhere around
the 300 North Carver block.

35:59.530 --> 36:01.764
Steve, okay,
one of the addresses

36:01.766 --> 36:03.450
is 330 North Carver Road.

36:03.452 --> 36:04.884
It's the computer science
building.

36:04.886 --> 36:06.436
All right, good.
That's got to be it.

36:06.438 --> 36:07.904
I'm on my way.

36:07.906 --> 36:09.622
All right, the plane
to Pago Pago

36:09.624 --> 36:11.107
leaves in 15 minutes,
all right?

36:11.109 --> 36:12.242
Until we hear back
from Catherine,

36:12.244 --> 36:13.943
we stick with the plan.
All right.

36:13.945 --> 36:15.161
Let's go.

36:15.163 --> 36:16.446
Get up.

36:18.499 --> 36:20.467
I hope you booked
me a window seat.

36:20.469 --> 36:21.885
(slices zip tie)

36:26.457 --> 36:28.258
Walk.

36:38.519 --> 36:40.520
What are you doing?

36:41.405 --> 36:43.106
Excuse me?
Are you using this computer?

36:43.108 --> 36:44.908
I'm, uh, saving it for a friend.

36:44.910 --> 36:46.109
Okay.

36:46.111 --> 36:47.577
That him?

36:47.579 --> 36:49.612
Yeah. Gave me 500 bucks
to hold this seat...

36:49.614 --> 36:50.580
Get up.

36:50.582 --> 36:52.032
Get up now. Up.

37:00.657 --> 37:03.426
You'll get an e-mail
with instructions once I land.

37:05.296 --> 37:07.263
(sighs)

37:07.265 --> 37:09.215
I'll see you soon.

37:09.217 --> 37:11.167
(chuckles)

37:12.770 --> 37:15.889
Oh, tell your daughter
I said thanks for the loaner.

37:15.891 --> 37:18.641
Or maybe I'll just tell her
in person one day.

37:18.643 --> 37:20.343
Get your ass on that plane

37:20.345 --> 37:22.612
before you get a bullet
in your face.

37:47.254 --> 37:49.089
(cell phone ringing)

37:55.429 --> 37:56.980
STEVE:
Come on, Catherine.

37:56.982 --> 37:59.182
Come on, come on, come on.

37:59.184 --> 38:01.851
(phone continues ringing)
CATHERINE: Come on, come on.

38:08.109 --> 38:09.892
It's uploaded.
The signal's been jammed.

38:09.894 --> 38:12.495
<i>Pilots have regained control</i>
<i>of Flight 408.</i>

38:12.497 --> 38:14.747
All right.
Let's get him.

38:37.221 --> 38:39.472
Where the hell did he go?

38:42.810 --> 38:44.727
CHIN: <i>We got the whole airport</i>
<i>on lockdown,</i>

38:44.729 --> 38:46.112
but so far,
no sign of Ian.

38:46.114 --> 38:47.597
Passengers on the
plane said he

38:47.599 --> 38:50.066
got up to use the restroom,
he never came back to his seat.

38:50.068 --> 38:51.100
GROVER:
I don't know how

38:51.102 --> 38:52.485
this kid did what he did.

38:52.487 --> 38:53.820
Couldn't have
gotten far, though.

38:53.822 --> 38:55.538
(over P.A.): Paxana Airlines
We'll find him.

38:55.540 --> 38:56.939
Flight 408 from Los Angeles

38:56.941 --> 38:59.826
has arrived at Gate 34A.

39:01.795 --> 39:04.614
You made the right call.

39:10.454 --> 39:11.787
DENNING:
<i>Steve...</i>

39:11.789 --> 39:14.290
Governor, before you
say anything, I, uh...

39:14.292 --> 39:16.459
I want to take
full responsibility

39:16.461 --> 39:18.261
for today's events, okay?

39:18.263 --> 39:21.314
Captain Grover, he-he was
simply following my orders, sir.

39:21.316 --> 39:23.316
That's funny--
Captain Grover said

39:23.318 --> 39:26.236
the exact same thing.

39:27.855 --> 39:28.971
A lot of lives
were saved today

39:28.973 --> 39:30.023
because of you two.

39:30.025 --> 39:32.308
Well done, gentlemen.

39:51.345 --> 39:53.996
That was good work
today, Commander.

39:57.218 --> 39:59.435
You, too, Captain.

40:01.539 --> 40:03.005
You need a rid

40:03.840 --> 40:06.008
I don't ride shotgun.

40:06.010 --> 40:08.177
(starts engine)

40:36.674 --> 40:39.475
See, now I believe
you're doing your homework.

40:40.728 --> 40:43.763
This mean I get
my computer back?

40:43.765 --> 40:46.316
(groans)

40:46.318 --> 40:48.818
All right.

40:48.820 --> 40:50.603
Let's get something
straight, young lady.

40:50.605 --> 40:53.740
As long as you're living
in my house, under my roof,

40:53.742 --> 40:56.075
there will be no more
you-know-what

40:56.077 --> 40:57.560
with you-know-who.

40:57.562 --> 40:59.228
Are we clear?

40:59.230 --> 41:00.947
Yes, Daddy.

41:02.249 --> 41:04.701
All right.

41:12.459 --> 41:14.076
Listen, um...

41:19.516 --> 41:21.083
I realize it was
difficult for you

41:21.085 --> 41:23.603
to pack up all your things,
move out here with me

41:23.605 --> 41:26.306
and leave all your little
friends behind, so, uh...

41:27.441 --> 41:30.092
I know it was hard for you, too.

41:30.927 --> 41:32.779
Yeah.

41:32.781 --> 41:33.980
Don't be sad, Daddy.

41:33.982 --> 41:35.431
We're going to be happy here.

41:35.433 --> 41:36.866
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

41:36.868 --> 41:38.401
Oh, yeah, kiddo.

41:39.436 --> 41:41.621
I love you,
little girl.

41:41.623 --> 41:43.623
I love you, too.

41:43.625 --> 41:45.541
Yeah, I know.

41:45.543 --> 41:47.493
You better.

41:47.495 --> 41:49.712
(chuckling)

41:55.669 --> 41:58.504
(vehicle comes to a stop)

41:58.506 --> 42:01.391
(car door opens and closes)

42:27.034 --> 42:29.585
I'm going to find you.

42:29.587 --> 42:31.821
