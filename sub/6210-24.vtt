00:01.767 --> 00:03.634
ZELDA:
I have something to tell you.

00:03.635 --> 00:06.204
Something that could change
all our lives forever.

00:06.205 --> 00:07.471
You're buying me a new car.

00:07.473 --> 00:08.774
You're having my baby.

00:08.775 --> 00:10.708
Stop it. Let her talk.
You see--

00:10.709 --> 00:12.577
Oh, we're finally getting
a cabana boy!

00:12.578 --> 00:16.948
No! Now, I know you're not going
to like what I'm about to say,

00:16.949 --> 00:19.250
but be warned,
I don't want to hear it.

00:19.251 --> 00:22.854
Say it!
Okay...

00:22.855 --> 00:26.124
I think Willard Kraft
is going to propose to me.

00:26.125 --> 00:27.892
I don't want to hear it!

00:27.893 --> 00:29.294
Will you excuse us?

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:38.404 --> 00:40.672
( both screaming )

00:40.673 --> 00:42.474
I heard that.

00:46.813 --> 00:49.447
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

00:59.858 --> 01:02.060
Who you calling chicken?

01:08.668 --> 01:11.102
I was so excited about getting
a job at the school store

01:11.103 --> 01:13.438
until I found out Mr. Kraft
is gonna be my boss.

01:13.439 --> 01:15.373
Well, I was
so excited about life

01:15.374 --> 01:18.543
until I found out Mr. Kraft
is gonna be my new step-uncle.

01:18.544 --> 01:20.445
Your Aunt Zelda's
marrying Mr. Kraft?

01:20.446 --> 01:21.545
It can't be.

01:21.546 --> 01:22.647
Oh, it be.

01:22.648 --> 01:25.349
I am so, so sorry.

01:25.350 --> 01:26.651
I've got a plan.

01:26.652 --> 01:28.253
I'm gonna act as obnoxious
as possible.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.321
He won't wanna live
with a troubled teen.

01:30.322 --> 01:32.890
Sabrina,
can I talk to you alone?

01:32.891 --> 01:35.894
Sure. If we can get rid
of Miss Third Wheel over here.

01:35.895 --> 01:39.063
Sorry. I was just trying
to act obnoxious for Mr. Kraft.

01:39.064 --> 01:43.434
Oh. Good. I was worried
it was a new nickname.

01:43.435 --> 01:44.835
Miss Third Wheel.

01:44.836 --> 01:46.004
I like it.

01:47.673 --> 01:50.075
So I have something
important to tell you.

01:50.076 --> 01:51.942
Harvey, your Adam's apple
is quivering.

01:57.049 --> 02:00.118
This is perfect.
Nice and quiet.

02:01.521 --> 02:04.188
Sabrina, I...

02:04.189 --> 02:06.757
( rap music playing
over stereo )

02:06.758 --> 02:10.595
Anyways, Sabrina...

02:10.596 --> 02:12.764
( jackhammer pounding )

02:12.765 --> 02:14.965
I-- I-- I just want
to say that...

02:14.966 --> 02:17.202
( cars crashing )

02:17.203 --> 02:18.570
Sabrina, I...

02:18.571 --> 02:19.604
( school bell rings )

02:19.605 --> 02:21.606
I give up!

02:21.607 --> 02:25.543
Okay, well, let's get together
and almost talk another time.

02:25.544 --> 02:28.580
So as you may
or may not know,

02:28.581 --> 02:30.681
next Saturday we're having
our policemen's ball,

02:30.682 --> 02:33.285
and I was wondering--
Well, I'd love to go, um...

02:33.286 --> 02:34.519
Dale.

02:34.520 --> 02:35.920
Ma'am, I'm <i>selling</i> tickets.

02:35.921 --> 02:38.423
Oh. Well, I'll take two.

02:40.092 --> 02:41.659
Will there be
firemen there?

02:43.028 --> 02:44.896
What you reading?
Nothing.

02:44.897 --> 02:46.730
Well, I'm off to the kitchen.

02:49.835 --> 02:51.803
<i>Today's Bride?!</i>

02:51.804 --> 02:54.439
I accidentally picked it up
instead of <i>Omni.</i>

02:54.440 --> 02:56.340
SALEM:
Zelda!

02:56.341 --> 02:58.176
Excuse me.

02:58.177 --> 03:00.878
Zelda, darling,
as your bridal consultant,

03:00.879 --> 03:02.713
I insist
you make some decisions.

03:02.714 --> 03:05.049
Ice sculpture
or chocolate fountain?

03:05.050 --> 03:06.585
Both would
be gauche.

03:06.586 --> 03:09.253
And when did Salem
become <i>Mr.</i> Salem?

03:10.389 --> 03:12.557
I just want a simple
garden ceremony.

03:12.558 --> 03:14.091
Honey,
if we're going that route,

03:14.092 --> 03:16.093
let's just book
a polka band.

03:16.094 --> 03:19.297
Am I the only one unwilling
to overlook the obvious?

03:19.298 --> 03:20.698
That Salem is fired?

03:20.699 --> 03:22.066
Huh?

03:22.067 --> 03:23.868
No. Obvious fact number one:

03:23.869 --> 03:27.004
Willard hasn't asked you
to marry him yet.

03:27.005 --> 03:28.873
And obvious fact
number two--

03:28.874 --> 03:32.510
Heh. You said,
"number two."

03:32.511 --> 03:36.847
Willard is unfortunately
still in love with me.

03:36.848 --> 03:38.583
I don't know why you want
to marry a man

03:38.584 --> 03:40.851
who's pining
after your sister.

03:40.852 --> 03:43.788
You forgot to mention
obvious fact number three:

03:43.789 --> 03:45.290
you're nuts!

03:46.625 --> 03:47.592
Hey, do you have any idea

03:47.593 --> 03:49.226
what Harvey was trying
to tell me?

03:49.227 --> 03:50.528
Do you mind?

03:50.529 --> 03:51.863
I need a notebook

03:51.864 --> 03:53.999
that doesn't clash
with my sweater.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.466
Today.

03:55.467 --> 03:57.669
That'll be $1.95.

03:57.670 --> 03:59.904
I hate to ask you this,
but could I pay you later?

03:59.905 --> 04:03.507
I spent all my allowance
on my cousin's prosthetic leg.

04:03.508 --> 04:05.109
Oh, Libby, that's so sad.

04:05.110 --> 04:07.745
Yeah, I'll...
I'll write you an IOU.

04:07.746 --> 04:09.614
Valerie, I don't think
she's going to pay you back.

04:09.615 --> 04:12.149
Why?
Uh, well,
there's her lame excuse,

04:12.150 --> 04:13.518
the fact that she's Libby...

04:13.519 --> 04:15.220
She bought
the cousin story.

04:15.221 --> 04:16.754
And that.

04:16.755 --> 04:18.122
Hey there! Hey! Hey!

04:18.123 --> 04:21.225
Ugh! There's future
Uncle Mr. Kraft.

04:21.226 --> 04:23.261
I wish my Aunt Zelda realized
what a villain he is.

04:23.262 --> 04:26.297
I know. I get woozy
every time he heads my way.

04:26.298 --> 04:27.832
Is he heading my way?

04:27.833 --> 04:30.000
Yep. Time to put my most
obnoxious foot forward.

04:30.001 --> 04:31.469
Well, I just scored

04:31.470 --> 04:34.172
a shipment of used
computer science books.

04:34.173 --> 04:36.340
There haven't been that
many technological advances

04:36.341 --> 04:37.408
since the '50s.

04:37.409 --> 04:40.811
Yeah?
You and what army?

04:40.812 --> 04:43.781
Okay, that wasn't obnoxious.
That was just stupid.

04:43.782 --> 04:45.916
Maybe Mr. Kraft won't want
to live with an idiot.

04:47.185 --> 04:48.353
Now, what makes you
so sure

04:48.354 --> 04:50.287
that Willard is going
to propose?

04:50.288 --> 04:52.324
Look, there have been
many hints.

04:52.325 --> 04:53.725
If you don't believe me,

04:53.726 --> 04:56.160
just bake
a wedding-indicator cake.

04:56.161 --> 04:58.095
Good idea.

04:58.096 --> 05:00.432
<i>The proposal hints</i>
<i>We will review</i>

05:00.433 --> 05:04.168
<i>Does this schlub</i>
<i>Want to marry you?</i>

05:04.169 --> 05:05.870
Zoo-zoo, there
is something personal

05:05.871 --> 05:08.006
I've been working up
the courage to ask you.

05:08.007 --> 05:10.007
ZELDA:
Okay, monkey,
what is it?

05:10.008 --> 05:11.976
Now, be patient,
my love.

05:11.977 --> 05:14.545
First, you must
meet Grammy Kraft

05:14.546 --> 05:17.415
so she can give us
her blessings.

05:17.416 --> 05:20.351
Blessings? She's probably
a lady of the cloth.

05:20.352 --> 05:22.453
Please, just give me
a teensy weensy

05:22.454 --> 05:23.788
little cluey wooey.

05:23.789 --> 05:26.924
Well...let's just say
that this spring

05:26.925 --> 05:29.727
might be
a pretty busy time for us.

05:29.728 --> 05:31.262
Spring, ha-ha.

05:31.263 --> 05:33.331
Spring wedding?
Spring bride?

05:33.332 --> 05:34.732
Get it?

05:34.733 --> 05:35.666
Hello!
Whoa!

05:35.667 --> 05:37.668
The man has not gotten
over me.

05:37.669 --> 05:39.003
Willard!

05:39.004 --> 05:40.004
Not to worry.

05:40.005 --> 05:41.606
The rosette broke
my fall.

05:41.607 --> 05:44.575
Do you see the way
he's looking at me?

05:44.576 --> 05:47.612
Okay. I'll take your IOU,
but you have to sign it.

05:50.382 --> 05:51.382
Here you go.

05:51.383 --> 05:52.851
Have a nice day.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.253
"Obi-Wan Ken..."

05:55.254 --> 05:56.687
Hey!

05:56.688 --> 05:59.958
Hey, Valerie, I need to talk
to you about Sabrina.

05:59.959 --> 06:01.992
Harvey,
your Adam's apple's quivering.

06:01.993 --> 06:03.327
I want
to tell her something.

06:03.328 --> 06:05.796
Something I've never
told another girl before,

06:05.797 --> 06:07.432
but I can't get
the words out.

06:07.433 --> 06:08.566
Well, what is it?

06:08.567 --> 06:10.334
( sighing ):
I love you.

06:10.335 --> 06:12.403
Aw!

06:12.404 --> 06:14.438
You do know
I meant Sabrina, right?

06:14.439 --> 06:15.205
That is so sweet.

06:15.206 --> 06:16.607
You've gotta tell her.

06:16.608 --> 06:18.143
What if she doesn't
say it back?

06:18.144 --> 06:19.344
I'll be devastated.

06:19.345 --> 06:20.878
( bell rings )

06:20.879 --> 06:22.113
I gotta go.

06:22.114 --> 06:25.182
Whatever you do,
don't tell Sabrina anything.

06:25.183 --> 06:26.617
Harvey wants to say
"I love you."

06:26.618 --> 06:28.753
He's never said it
to another girl before.

06:28.754 --> 06:31.522
Harvey loves me?
Harvey Kinkle loves me?

06:31.523 --> 06:33.591
Sounds better without
the Kinkle, doesn't it?

06:33.592 --> 06:36.193
Yeah. But, look, he's afraid
that you won't say it back.

06:36.194 --> 06:39.597
Of course I'd say it back.
I feel it back.

06:39.598 --> 06:40.998
So you're sure
she'll say it back?

06:40.999 --> 06:42.166
Well, how do you know?

06:42.167 --> 06:44.269
It's...a girl thing.

06:44.270 --> 06:45.770
Then I'll tell her
this Friday.

06:45.771 --> 06:48.605
That'll give me time
to get a haircut.

06:48.606 --> 06:50.007
This Friday?

06:50.008 --> 06:51.676
Yes, but you know nothing.

06:51.677 --> 06:52.877
( Kraft clears throat )

06:52.878 --> 06:54.578
Have I lost my mind,

06:54.579 --> 06:57.948
or should you two hens
be in class?

06:57.949 --> 06:59.984
Okay, that was
a perfect chance

06:59.985 --> 07:01.119
for you to be obnoxious.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.386
I've changed tacks.

07:02.387 --> 07:04.489
If I can find one thing
I can stand about Mr. Kraft,

07:04.490 --> 07:06.590
one tiny, little thing,
I can focus on that

07:06.591 --> 07:08.526
and that'll get me
through to college...

07:08.527 --> 07:09.594
KRAFT:
Just what part

07:09.595 --> 07:11.896
of "tuck your shirt in"
don't you understand?

07:11.897 --> 07:14.064
Well, he doesn't hit.

07:14.733 --> 07:17.101
One tiny little thing!

07:17.102 --> 07:19.270
Ow! Ow! Ow!

07:19.271 --> 07:20.672
You mean, meow!

07:20.673 --> 07:21.706
( chuckling )

07:21.707 --> 07:22.907
A little cat humor.

07:22.908 --> 07:24.008
Very little.

07:24.009 --> 07:26.277
I've got a hangnail
on my pointing finger.

07:26.278 --> 07:28.179
Oh, that's wonderful.

07:28.180 --> 07:30.381
You might want to work
on your bedside manner.

07:30.382 --> 07:31.549
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:31.550 --> 07:33.317
It's just I'm relieved
your magic is out.

07:33.318 --> 07:35.987
Willard and his grandmother
are coming to dinner tonight

07:35.988 --> 07:37.955
and you won't be able
to use your magic

07:37.956 --> 07:39.356
to spoil the evening.

07:39.357 --> 07:41.659
She's still got a mouth.

07:41.660 --> 07:44.362
I think he's going to propose.

07:44.363 --> 07:46.931
He said he's bringing
a very special box.

07:46.932 --> 07:49.600
Probably pine lined in satin.

07:49.601 --> 07:50.902
( clears throat )

07:50.903 --> 07:52.503
Move.

07:52.504 --> 07:54.205
I know I can find something

07:54.206 --> 07:56.240
I like about Willard Kraft.
I know I can.

07:56.241 --> 07:59.610
Miss Birkhead, you get these
deadbeats to pay up

07:59.611 --> 08:02.179
or it is coming out
of your own paycheck.

08:02.180 --> 08:07.051
What? Oh, please, save
your tears for debtors' prison.

08:07.052 --> 08:08.786
Move.

08:10.422 --> 08:11.622
( sighs )

08:11.623 --> 08:13.323
He has no odor
to speak of.

08:13.324 --> 08:15.527
Harvey, I'd love
to go out on Friday.

08:15.528 --> 08:16.961
I mean, how are you?

08:16.962 --> 08:20.264
Fine. So I was wondering,
wanna go out on Friday?

08:20.265 --> 08:21.332
Okay.
Okay.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.768
( Valerie crying )
Excuse me,

08:23.769 --> 08:25.569
I have to go visit
Lake Valerie.

08:25.570 --> 08:27.371
There.

08:27.372 --> 08:29.373
Now, what should
I make for dessert?

08:31.376 --> 08:33.878
No. It looks like
I'm trying too hard.

08:35.313 --> 08:37.147
Me like pie.

08:37.148 --> 08:38.682
Pie.

08:42.154 --> 08:43.488
Marvelous.

08:43.489 --> 08:47.158
Grammy Kraft is bound
to like one of these.

08:47.159 --> 08:49.193
Hangnail...caught...help.

08:49.194 --> 08:50.861
Hold still.

08:52.464 --> 08:54.765
Oh. Thanks. Could you
zip me up, please?

08:54.766 --> 08:55.799
Gladly.

08:57.736 --> 08:59.203
( laughing )

08:59.204 --> 09:01.438
I meant the dress.

09:01.439 --> 09:02.840
I love you.

09:02.841 --> 09:04.442
I love ya.

09:04.443 --> 09:06.310
I <i>love</i> you.

09:06.311 --> 09:07.711
I love you too.

09:07.712 --> 09:09.513
If you loved me, you'd knock.

09:09.514 --> 09:10.914
So, what's new?

09:10.915 --> 09:12.450
Eh, not much.

09:12.451 --> 09:14.752
Got a letter from Mom.
Killed a plant.

09:14.753 --> 09:16.554
Oh, and overheard
that Mr. Kraft is asking

09:16.555 --> 09:19.423
for Zelda's hand
in marriage tonight.

09:19.424 --> 09:20.424
Tonight?

09:20.425 --> 09:22.359
( gasping ):
I need air.

09:27.132 --> 09:29.333
That did absolutely nothing.

09:29.334 --> 09:30.968
Aunt Hilda, is it true?

09:30.969 --> 09:32.069
I thought
we had more time.

09:32.070 --> 09:33.704
I know.

09:33.705 --> 09:35.339
He's marrying Zelda
to get back at me.

09:35.340 --> 09:37.241
The ultimate revenge.
What are we gonna do?

09:37.242 --> 09:39.210
I've done everything,
I even stooped so low

09:39.211 --> 09:40.611
I tried to see the good.

09:40.612 --> 09:42.680
I guess we just have
to accept it

09:42.681 --> 09:45.549
and envision ourselves
as one big, happy family.

09:46.785 --> 09:48.653
( <i>"The Brady Bunch</i> Theme"
playing )

09:55.294 --> 09:57.394
I'll take Jan Brady to block.

09:57.395 --> 09:59.196
Why does Mr. Kraft have to rear
his ugly head now?

09:59.197 --> 10:01.231
I should be looking forward
to my date with Harvey

10:01.232 --> 10:03.667
and those words that'll make it
the happiest day ever.

10:03.668 --> 10:05.236
What's happening Friday?
Nothing.

10:05.237 --> 10:09.740
I want everything
to be just perfect.

10:09.741 --> 10:12.043
There. We're going to have
a lovely supper

10:12.044 --> 10:14.245
and then afterwards,
you'll wheel Grammy Kraft

10:14.246 --> 10:15.846
into our new
handicap bathroom.

10:16.982 --> 10:18.182
You do that for him,

10:18.183 --> 10:20.117
and yet I can't have
a racquetball court?

10:20.118 --> 10:22.887
And then Willard will ask me
to be his wife,

10:22.888 --> 10:24.521
and I'll say yes,

10:24.522 --> 10:26.523
and everything
will be wonderful,

10:26.524 --> 10:29.727
and we will all live
tolerantly ever after.

10:29.728 --> 10:31.128
( doorbell rings )

10:31.129 --> 10:32.496
( gasps )

10:32.497 --> 10:34.932
They're here.
Oh, I hope I look okay.

10:34.933 --> 10:37.534
She's so excited. We've only
been thinking about ourselves.

10:37.535 --> 10:39.871
Well, you're just
a teenager and I'm...me.

10:39.872 --> 10:42.039
I know, but, look, we can't
ruin it for her, okay?

10:42.040 --> 10:43.340
We've got to make a pact.

10:43.341 --> 10:44.909
We won't say a word,

10:44.910 --> 10:46.177
no matter what
Willard Kraft says.

10:46.178 --> 10:49.246
No matter how
offensive or vile.

10:49.247 --> 10:50.581
Hello.

10:50.582 --> 10:51.749
Well, that's
my breaking point.

10:51.750 --> 10:52.683
Mine too.

10:57.056 --> 10:59.423
Well, I guess
we should shut the door.

10:59.424 --> 11:01.658
There's a real storm brewing.

11:01.659 --> 11:03.761
Well, where's
Grammy Kraft?

11:03.762 --> 11:06.297
She's coming. She...

11:06.298 --> 11:08.231
always insists
on driving her own car

11:08.232 --> 11:10.634
despite the legal blindness.

11:10.635 --> 11:12.002
We are still going to have

11:12.003 --> 11:13.904
a family dinner, though,
aren't we?

11:13.905 --> 11:15.172
Oh, yes.

11:15.173 --> 11:17.107
Hilda and Sabrina
just went upstairs to...

11:17.108 --> 11:19.176
check on their ant farm.

11:19.177 --> 11:21.979
Their workers
are trying to unionize.

11:21.980 --> 11:24.615
There's got to be a way for us
to keep quiet through dinner.

11:24.616 --> 11:27.552
I know a "mum's the word" spell,
but my magic's still out.

11:27.553 --> 11:29.454
Oh, I'd be happy
to shut your mouth.

11:29.455 --> 11:31.922
Hey, you know what I mean.

11:31.923 --> 11:33.390
Okay. Here it is.

11:33.391 --> 11:35.426
<i>So nothing unkind</i>
<i>Will be heard</i>

11:35.427 --> 11:38.095
<i>Just remember</i>
<i>Mum's the word</i>

11:38.096 --> 11:39.296
Okay, let's do a test.

11:39.297 --> 11:41.832
( as Kraft ):
Sorry, my heart belongs
to Zoo-zoo.

11:41.833 --> 11:43.935
Mum.
That's great, Aunt Hilda.

11:43.936 --> 11:46.103
Mum.
Is that all you can say?

11:46.104 --> 11:47.704
What a stupid spell.

11:47.705 --> 11:48.705
Oh! Okay.

11:48.706 --> 11:49.874
I think I'm gonna go

11:49.875 --> 11:52.309
with "if you can't say
anything nice" spell.

11:52.310 --> 11:54.011
"To enact spell, press here."

11:54.012 --> 11:55.980
MAN:
<i>Cripes, shut your pie hole.</i>

11:55.981 --> 11:57.815
<i>Yeah, that's more like it.</i>

12:00.652 --> 12:01.819
And you don't think

12:01.820 --> 12:04.021
we should have waited
for Grammy Kraft?

12:04.022 --> 12:05.223
No, she's a slow driver,

12:05.224 --> 12:08.392
and she's always stopping
for hitchhikers.

12:08.393 --> 12:10.594
Listen. Are you gonna
finish those potatoes?

12:10.595 --> 12:13.030
Mum.
You're right. They are good.

12:13.031 --> 12:15.733
Sabrina, you've been
awfully quiet

12:15.734 --> 12:18.168
and that's greatly appreciated.

12:18.169 --> 12:20.003
But why don't you tell us
about school?

12:20.004 --> 12:22.106
KRAFT:
Yeah, I'd love to hear
about that ant farm.

12:22.107 --> 12:24.708
( doorbell rings )

12:24.709 --> 12:26.210
Mm.

12:27.546 --> 12:29.046
Oh.

12:29.047 --> 12:32.316
Yeah, I think Grammy's
really gonna like you.

12:32.317 --> 12:33.718
And later on,
I want to get you alone

12:33.719 --> 12:35.486
and finally ask you
that question.

12:35.487 --> 12:36.953
You have a question for me?

12:36.954 --> 12:38.022
KRAFT:
Mm-hm.

12:38.023 --> 12:40.924
Gosh, I wonder
what that could be.

12:44.563 --> 12:46.030
Um, Sabrina, I have something
to say to you,

12:46.031 --> 12:47.431
and it can't wait
till Friday.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.869
Yes, I know
my Adam's apple's quivering.

12:53.405 --> 12:55.605
I have to get this
off my chest

12:55.606 --> 12:57.508
and please don't say
anything until I finish.

12:58.410 --> 13:00.177
Oh.

13:00.178 --> 13:02.446
You don't need to take notes.
I'll be brief.

13:04.248 --> 13:06.784
Sabrina...I love you.

13:09.087 --> 13:10.688
Jump in any time here.

13:11.723 --> 13:12.924
I should have known

13:12.925 --> 13:15.159
a girl like you wouldn't
love a guy like me.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.167
( <i>dramatic piano theme playing</i> )

13:52.397 --> 13:55.833
Oh! It's nice to hear
the sound of my own voice.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.267
¶ Fa-la-la-la-la-la-- ¶

13:57.268 --> 13:58.635
( choking )

13:58.636 --> 14:01.439
I gather you want
an explanation.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.909
Did you put a silent spell
on you and Hilda?

14:04.910 --> 14:08.145
Well, when you incant two
silent spells under one roof,

14:08.146 --> 14:10.648
everything under the roof
becomes a silent movie.

14:14.719 --> 14:17.388
Why didn't it kick in
when you cast the spells?

14:17.389 --> 14:18.755
Uh, 'cause.

14:20.725 --> 14:22.559
Why am I so worthless?

14:22.560 --> 14:24.427
That's just rude.

14:24.428 --> 14:26.831
( <i>upbeat piano theme playing</i> )

15:52.450 --> 15:54.785
Sabrina?

15:54.786 --> 15:57.021
I can't find my car keys.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.764
( <i>upbeat piano theme playing</i> )

16:40.132 --> 16:41.832
Sabrina, I sure hope
you know

16:41.833 --> 16:43.967
what I should do
about Mr. Kraft.

16:49.206 --> 16:51.642
( <i>dramatic piano theme playing</i> )

18:25.603 --> 18:27.104
Hey, we're in color.

18:27.105 --> 18:28.672
( gasping ):
And I can talk!

18:29.307 --> 18:30.273
Just reminding myself

18:30.274 --> 18:32.075
to appreciate
the little things.

18:32.076 --> 18:33.877
Sabrina, I just want you to know

18:33.878 --> 18:36.713
that I understand if you
don't feel the same way about--

18:36.714 --> 18:38.348
Harvey...

18:38.349 --> 18:39.817
I love you.

18:39.818 --> 18:41.751
Really?

18:41.752 --> 18:43.620
Cool.

18:43.621 --> 18:44.754
Very cool.

18:44.755 --> 18:46.490
So now that we've got
that out of our systems,

18:46.491 --> 18:48.458
would you excuse me
for a minute?

18:50.028 --> 18:51.562
Would you excuse us
a minute?

18:51.563 --> 18:53.297
Excuse us.

18:55.099 --> 18:56.900
Miss Birkhead?

18:56.901 --> 18:59.602
Are you having any luck
recouping those IOUs?

18:59.603 --> 19:03.373
I'm selling my kidney on Ebay.

19:03.374 --> 19:05.608
So the movie ended just
'cause Harvey and I kissed?

19:05.609 --> 19:08.045
Whoo!

19:08.046 --> 19:10.146
Sabrina, a silent movie
always ends with a kiss.

19:10.147 --> 19:11.782
Or some wacky outtakes.

19:11.783 --> 19:13.217
ZELDA:
I can't believe I spent

19:13.218 --> 19:15.853
half my special evening
over-gesturing.

19:15.854 --> 19:16.920
I'm sorry, Aunt Zelda.

19:16.921 --> 19:18.288
We just didn't want
to say anything

19:18.289 --> 19:19.756
that would ruin
your big moment.

19:19.757 --> 19:21.792
But thankfully,
my mistake showed you

19:21.793 --> 19:23.560
that Mr. Kraft
really is a villain.

19:23.561 --> 19:26.496
Uh-huh,
and Harvey really is a Mountie.

19:26.497 --> 19:28.732
It was just a movie.

19:28.733 --> 19:30.934
Are you upset just 'cause
you weren't the lead?

19:30.935 --> 19:33.703
Everyone continue
enjoying pie...

19:33.704 --> 19:35.205
You bet.

19:35.206 --> 19:36.840
Except you.

19:36.841 --> 19:39.042
Wha...? What?

19:42.980 --> 19:45.716
Well, we're...

19:45.717 --> 19:47.318
finally alone.

19:47.319 --> 19:49.553
Uh-huh.

19:49.554 --> 19:51.321
So...

19:51.322 --> 19:54.424
What was this question
you wanted to ask me?

19:54.425 --> 19:57.127
Yes, there is a question.

19:57.128 --> 20:00.130
Would you mind
getting down on one knee?

20:01.900 --> 20:03.033
Oh.

20:03.034 --> 20:04.401
No, um...

20:06.136 --> 20:08.705
Oh, Zoo-zoo, my dear.

( sighing )

20:13.777 --> 20:15.679

20:15.680 --> 20:19.082
Will you...do my taxes?

20:19.083 --> 20:21.084
Receipts?

20:22.353 --> 20:25.121
I've waited
my whole life for this?

20:28.593 --> 20:29.960
You know,
for some reason

20:29.961 --> 20:31.595
I thought the night
we proclaimed our love

20:31.596 --> 20:32.796
would be more romantic.

20:32.797 --> 20:34.898
Me too,
but this is good pie.

20:39.336 --> 20:41.204
Aunt Zelda, I'm sorry
things didn't turn out

20:41.205 --> 20:42.806
the way you
wanted them to.

20:42.807 --> 20:44.608
Well, it all worked out.

20:44.609 --> 20:45.976
Willard and I talked,
and...

20:45.977 --> 20:47.778
once we cleaned
the shards of glass

20:47.779 --> 20:51.181
out of his mustache,
he asked me to go steady.

20:51.182 --> 20:52.583
( all squealing )

20:52.584 --> 20:54.818
So you are happy for me?

20:54.819 --> 20:58.288
Oh, we're just happy
you're not getting married.

21:03.227 --> 21:06.129
Did my silent movie spell turn
into a horror movie spell?

21:06.130 --> 21:08.031
No, it's just
another relative

21:08.032 --> 21:09.900
with another clue
to the family secret.

21:09.901 --> 21:11.868
Oh, I see
the family resemblance.

21:11.869 --> 21:13.470
Aunt Hilda,
you look just like Fay Wray.

21:13.471 --> 21:15.838
You think?
Fay Wray is the clue,

21:15.839 --> 21:17.440
but we are related to Kong.

21:17.441 --> 21:20.377
He's a third cousin
with a pituitary problem.

21:20.378 --> 21:22.812
Oh, okay,
so I've got Fay,

21:22.813 --> 21:25.049
a picture of me and a picture
of Robert E. Lee.

21:25.050 --> 21:27.384
Fay...me...Lee.

21:27.385 --> 21:28.485
Family!

So the Spellman family secret
