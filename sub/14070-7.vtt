WEBVTT

00:09.469 --> 00:10.970
That's better.

00:18.645 --> 00:20.230
You don't need it.

00:23.107 --> 00:24.525
Still pretty?

00:24.609 --> 00:26.402
Yeah!

00:26.486 --> 00:28.363
Pretty. Really pretty.

00:34.702 --> 00:35.703
El?

00:36.871 --> 00:37.997
Yes?

00:39.165 --> 00:42.252
Um, I'm happy you're home.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.837
Me, too.

00:51.219 --> 00:52.971
--Guys!

00:53.054 --> 00:54.681
It's Lucas,
I think he's in trouble.

00:56.683 --> 00:58.560
Do you remember how he said
he was looking for the gate?

00:58.643 --> 01:00.228
- Yeah.
- What if he found it?

01:03.314 --> 01:04.357
What's he saying?

01:04.440 --> 01:06.484
I don't know, he's way out of range.

01:07.193 --> 01:08.528
...son of a bitch!

01:08.611 --> 01:11.739
Lucas, if you can hear us, slow down.
We can't understand you.

01:11.823 --> 01:14.409
Yes, I copy!
Do you?

01:14.492 --> 01:16.244
They know about Eleven!

01:16.327 --> 01:18.371
Get out of there!
They know about Eleven!

01:18.454 --> 01:20.957
The bad men are coming!
All of them!

01:21.040 --> 01:23.710
Do you hear me?
The bad men are coming!

01:23.793 --> 01:25.461
"Mad hen."
Does that mean anything to you?

01:25.545 --> 01:26.879
Like a code name or something?

01:26.963 --> 01:29.424
- The bad men are coming!
- "Bad men."

01:29.507 --> 01:31.134
- Bad men!

01:31.217 --> 01:33.136
Stay here.

01:42.437 --> 01:43.730
What's that guy doing?

01:43.813 --> 01:45.732
You don't think...

01:47.567 --> 01:49.986
Well, I know she and Steve
have been spending some time together,

01:50.069 --> 01:51.237
-so I thought maybe--
-Mom!

01:51.321 --> 01:53.114
Well, is he home?

01:53.197 --> 01:54.240
-Maybe you could ask him?
-Mom!

01:54.324 --> 01:55.617
I'm sorry,
can you just hold on, please?

01:55.700 --> 01:57.827
Michael, I'm on the phone.
I've told you a million times--

01:57.910 --> 01:59.829
-Did you schedule any repairs?
-What?

01:59.912 --> 02:02.582
Is there anyone supposed to come
and do repairs on the house?

02:13.051 --> 02:14.302
I don't understand.
Is there something wrong--

02:14.385 --> 02:16.638
- No, Mom, nothing's wrong in the house.
- Mike!

02:16.721 --> 02:18.681
- One second.
- Mike!

02:18.765 --> 02:22.685
We need to leave...
right now.

02:24.687 --> 02:26.731
--Michael!

02:27.482 --> 02:30.610
If anyone asks where I am,
I've left the country.

02:30.693 --> 02:31.778
What?

02:57.261 --> 02:59.514
Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

03:10.066 --> 03:11.359
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

03:11.442 --> 03:13.820
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Dustin!

03:13.903 --> 03:15.780
Dustin, do you copy?

03:15.863 --> 03:17.698
Yeah, Lucas, they're on us.

03:17.782 --> 03:19.409
-Where are you?
-Cornwallis.

03:19.492 --> 03:20.785
Meet me at Elm and Cherry!

03:20.868 --> 03:22.495
Copy. Elm and Cherry!

03:22.578 --> 03:23.788
Okay.

03:31.421 --> 03:33.214
-Shit!
-This way, come on!

03:38.469 --> 03:39.595
Out of the way!

03:39.679 --> 03:41.305
- Out of the way!

03:48.855 --> 03:50.022
- Lucas!
- Where are they?

03:50.106 --> 03:51.399
- I don't know.
- I think we lost them.

03:51.482 --> 03:53.943
--Go, go, go, go, go!

03:56.446 --> 03:58.114
Go, go, go, go, go!

03:58.197 --> 04:00.533
-Faster, faster!
-Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

04:51.542 --> 04:53.127
Holy... holy shit!

04:53.211 --> 04:55.588
Did... did you see
what she did to that van?

04:55.671 --> 04:56.756
No, Dustin, we missed it.

04:56.839 --> 04:59.342
- I mean that was...
- Awesome.

05:01.427 --> 05:03.095
It was awesome.

05:09.977 --> 05:13.815
Everything I said
about you being a traitor and stuff...

05:15.107 --> 05:16.526
I was wrong.

05:19.862 --> 05:21.364
I'm sorry.

05:25.910 --> 05:27.078
Friends...

05:28.329 --> 05:29.872
friends don't lie.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.085
I'm sorry, too.

05:35.586 --> 05:36.629
Me, too.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.137
Hey.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.681
Jonathan?
Jesus, what... what happened?

07:10.765 --> 07:11.933
- Ma'am...
- I'm fine.

07:12.016 --> 07:13.476
Why is he wearing handcuffs?

07:13.559 --> 07:15.686
Well, your boy assaulted a police officer.
That's why.

07:15.770 --> 07:18.064
-Take them off.
-I am afraid I cannot do that.

07:18.147 --> 07:20.232
-Take them off!
-You heard her. Take 'em off.

07:20.316 --> 07:25.780
Chief, I get everyone's emotional here,
but there's something you need to see.

07:32.703 --> 07:33.788
What is this?

07:33.871 --> 07:35.456
Why don't you ask your son?
We found it in his car.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.166
-What?
-Why are you going through my car?

07:37.249 --> 07:39.043
Is that really the question
you should be asking right now?

07:39.543 --> 07:41.212
I wanna see you in my office.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.630
You won't believe me.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.717
Why don't you give me a try?

07:48.010 --> 07:50.513
Mike? Mike?

08:11.701 --> 08:13.828
Yeah, just a minute, please!

08:14.745 --> 08:17.581
- Jiminy Christmas.

08:18.499 --> 08:19.959
Hold your horses.

08:23.963 --> 08:25.006
Mr. Wheeler?

08:25.089 --> 08:26.716
Yes?

09:08.174 --> 09:10.551
I don't understand.

09:10.634 --> 09:13.012
You think my son is hiding this girl?

09:13.095 --> 09:14.221
What happened to her hair?

09:14.305 --> 09:16.849
We just need to know
if you've seen her in the past week.

09:16.932 --> 09:20.144
-No, no.
-Absolutely not.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.937
Our son with a girl?

09:22.021 --> 09:24.315
I mean, believe me,

09:24.398 --> 09:27.735
if he had a girl sleeping in this house,
we'd know about it.

09:27.818 --> 09:29.403
Wouldn't we?

09:30.571 --> 09:32.323
This girl...

09:32.406 --> 09:33.449
what has she done?

09:33.532 --> 09:35.284
I'm afraid I can't answer that.

09:35.367 --> 09:36.660
- Oh, my God, is she Russian?

09:36.744 --> 09:39.872
-You can't treat us like this.
-I need you to stay calm.

09:39.955 --> 09:41.665
You come into my house,

09:41.749 --> 09:44.251
and you tell me that my son
is hiding some girl,

09:44.335 --> 09:47.463
and that he's in danger,
but you can't tell us why?

09:47.546 --> 09:50.382
And you, what,
you expect me to remain, what, calm?

10:01.685 --> 10:04.063
I understand how upsetting this is.

10:05.106 --> 10:07.358
I wish we could tell you more...

10:08.692 --> 10:13.739
but I can tell you that your son,
Michael, is in real danger.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.660
We want to help him.

10:17.743 --> 10:20.538
We will help him.
I give you my word.

10:22.373 --> 10:24.500
But in order for me to do that...

10:26.127 --> 10:27.920
you have to trust me.

10:30.381 --> 10:32.049
Will you trust me?

10:37.721 --> 10:39.014
Good.

10:39.098 --> 10:40.266
Now...

10:42.184 --> 10:44.645
do you have any idea
where your son might have gone?

10:48.858 --> 10:51.986
This is Randolph Road, right here.

10:52.069 --> 10:55.614
The fence starts here,
and goes all the way around.

10:56.532 --> 10:58.659
And this is the lab right here.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.202
The gate's gotta be in there somewhere.

11:00.286 --> 11:01.328
It's gotta be.

11:01.412 --> 11:03.289
Well, who owns Hawkins Lab?

11:03.372 --> 11:04.790
The sign says "Department of Energy."

11:04.874 --> 11:07.001
Department of Energy?
What do you think that means?

11:07.084 --> 11:09.044
It means government. Military.

11:09.128 --> 11:11.297
- Then why does it say "Energy"?
- Just trust me, all right?

11:11.380 --> 11:12.840
It's military. My dad's told me before.

11:12.923 --> 11:14.675
Mike's right. There's soldiers out front.

11:14.758 --> 11:16.802
Do they make, like,
lightbulbs or something?

11:16.886 --> 11:18.095
No, weapons...

11:18.178 --> 11:19.680
to fight the Russians,
and commies and stuff.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.307
Weapons.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.768
Oh, Jesus, this is bad.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.646
Really bad.
The place is like a fortress.

11:27.730 --> 11:28.772
Well, what do we do?

11:28.856 --> 11:30.524
I don't know,
but we can't go home.

11:30.608 --> 11:32.026
We're fugitives now.

11:34.486 --> 11:35.738
Guys?

11:36.780 --> 11:38.574
Do you hear that?

11:44.622 --> 11:46.040
- Go, go, go, go!
- Come on, come on!

11:46.123 --> 11:47.791
-It's stuck.
-Let's go, let's go, let's go!

11:47.875 --> 11:49.126
- Hurry up! Hurry, come on!
- Come on!

11:49.209 --> 11:50.628
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

11:52.254 --> 11:54.506
--Get down!

12:00.888 --> 12:02.264
Mental.

12:09.355 --> 12:11.190
You say blood draws this thing?

12:11.273 --> 12:12.608
We don't know.

12:13.525 --> 12:14.860
It's just a theory.

12:18.948 --> 12:20.157
I'm sorry, Mom.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.243
What, you're sorry?
You're... you're sorry?

12:23.327 --> 12:25.120
-That is not good enough, Jonathan.
-I know.

12:25.204 --> 12:27.623
That's not even close. That's not even
in the... in the ballpark.

12:27.706 --> 12:29.291
I wanted to tell you, I just--

12:29.375 --> 12:31.627
What if this thing took you, too?

12:31.710 --> 12:35.005
You risked your life... and Nancy's.

12:35.089 --> 12:38.550
I thought I could save Will...
I still do.

12:38.634 --> 12:41.011
This is not yours to fix alone.

12:41.095 --> 12:45.933
You act like you're all alone
out there in the world, but you're not.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.142
You're not alone.

12:47.226 --> 12:48.602
I know.

12:48.686 --> 12:50.104
God damn it, Jonathan.

12:50.187 --> 12:52.898
-I know.
-Damn it.

12:55.818 --> 12:56.986
I want an apology!

12:57.069 --> 12:58.237
An apology for what, exactly?

12:58.320 --> 13:00.072
Where is the chief?
I want to speak to him

13:00.155 --> 13:01.490
-right this instant.
-Stay here.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.409
Ma'am, I need you to calm down.

13:03.492 --> 13:04.660
What is your name, Deputy?

13:04.743 --> 13:06.537
Well, I'm an officer...
okay?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.080
Name and badge number,
both of you!

13:08.163 --> 13:10.040
- What the hell is going on here?
- Chief...

13:10.124 --> 13:12.084
These men are humiliating my son.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.169
-No, no, no. Okay, that's not true.
-Yes.

13:14.253 --> 13:15.629
There was some kind of fight, Chief--

13:15.713 --> 13:18.382
A psychotic child broke his arm!

13:18.465 --> 13:21.719
-A little girl, Chief. A little one.
-That tone! Do you hear that tone?

13:21.802 --> 13:23.053
Honestly,
I'm just trying to state a fact.

13:23.137 --> 13:24.555
-I don't have time for this.
-It was a little girl--

13:24.638 --> 13:27.224
Will you please take a statement...
and get her out?

13:27.307 --> 13:28.475
- Yes.
- So what'd this girl look like?

13:28.559 --> 13:31.729
She had no hair
and she was bleeding from her nose.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.731
Like a freak.

13:33.814 --> 13:34.940
What'd you just say?

13:35.649 --> 13:37.151
I said she's a freak!

13:37.234 --> 13:40.029
No, her hair.
What'd you say about her hair?

13:40.112 --> 13:42.031
Her head's shaved.

13:42.114 --> 13:43.866
She doesn't even look like a girl.

13:45.284 --> 13:46.285
And...

13:47.036 --> 13:48.120
And what?

13:49.455 --> 13:51.206
Tell the man, Troy.

13:53.375 --> 13:54.877
She can...

13:57.254 --> 13:58.422
do things.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.799
What kind of things?

14:00.883 --> 14:01.925
Like...

14:04.303 --> 14:05.345
make you fly.

14:08.307 --> 14:09.641
And piss yourself.

14:09.725 --> 14:10.726
What?

14:12.311 --> 14:13.312
Was she alone?

14:14.772 --> 14:16.607
She always hangs out with those losers.

14:16.690 --> 14:17.858
"Losers"?

14:18.901 --> 14:20.486
What losers?

14:24.448 --> 14:25.657
Hey.

14:26.784 --> 14:28.285
You owe me $1.20.

14:30.079 --> 14:32.414
Don't worry, he'll need more than aspirin
when we're done with him.

14:32.498 --> 14:35.167
Yeah, if the creep ever gets out.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.835
The cops should just lock him up forever.

14:36.919 --> 14:39.505
- Did you see the look on his face?

14:39.588 --> 14:41.423
- Oh.

14:41.507 --> 14:43.842
He probably had that same look
whenever he killed his brother, right?

14:43.926 --> 14:48.430
Oh, God, I just got an image
of him making that face

14:48.514 --> 14:49.848
- while he and Nancy are screwing.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.767
Carol, for once in your life,
shut your damn mouth!

14:51.850 --> 14:54.561
-What?
-Hey, what's your problem, man?

14:56.313 --> 14:57.981
You're both assholes.
That's my problem.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.400
-Are you serious right now, man?
-Yeah, I'm serious.

14:59.483 --> 15:00.484
You shouldn't have done that.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.860
-Done what?
-You know what.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.821
You mean call her out
for what she really is?

15:03.904 --> 15:06.156
Oh, that's funny, because I don't remember
you asking me to stop.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.908
I should've put that spray paint
right down your throat.

15:07.991 --> 15:09.618
- What the hell, Steve?
- You know,

15:09.701 --> 15:11.787
neither of you ever cared about her.
You never even liked her,

15:11.870 --> 15:13.539
because she's not miserable like you two.

15:13.622 --> 15:15.040
She actually cares about other people.

15:15.124 --> 15:16.375
The slut with a heart of gold.

15:16.458 --> 15:17.668
I told you to watch your mouth!

15:17.751 --> 15:20.045
Hey! I don't know
what's gotten into you, man,

15:20.129 --> 15:22.423
-but you don't talk to her that way.
-Get out of my face.

15:22.506 --> 15:24.007
- Or what?

15:24.091 --> 15:25.175
Or what?

15:25.259 --> 15:26.844
You gonna fight me now, too? Huh?

15:26.927 --> 15:28.011
You gonna fight me now, too?

15:28.095 --> 15:30.389
Because you couldn't take
Jonathan Byers...

15:31.390 --> 15:34.226
so I wouldn't recommend that.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.402
- Here, let me get the door for you, buddy.

15:43.485 --> 15:46.280
That's right.
Run away, Stevie boy!

15:46.363 --> 15:48.866
Run away!
Just like you always do.

15:48.949 --> 15:52.286
That Nancy's turning you
into a little pussy!

15:53.203 --> 15:55.664
--That's right, Harrington, run away!

15:55.747 --> 15:58.375
Run away!

16:08.135 --> 16:09.553
I have to go home.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.138
No, you can't.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.975
-My mom... my dad are there.
-They're gonna be okay.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.520
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
-Let go.

16:18.604 --> 16:20.230
-Let go!
-Hey! Listen to me. Listen to me.

16:20.314 --> 16:21.773
The last thing in the world we need

16:21.857 --> 16:23.567
is them knowing
you're mixed up in all this.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.195
-Mike is over there--
-They haven't found him.

16:26.278 --> 16:27.571
Not yet, at least.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.909
-For Mike?
-Come on, get in the car.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.372
Look, we need to find them
before they do.

16:37.456 --> 16:38.790
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone?

16:38.874 --> 16:41.668
-No, I don't.
-I need you to think.

16:41.752 --> 16:43.462
I don't know.
We haven't talked a lot.

16:43.545 --> 16:45.380
I mean, lately...

16:45.464 --> 16:46.632
Is there any place that your...

16:46.715 --> 16:48.675
your parents don't know
about that he might go?

16:48.759 --> 16:50.886
- I don't know.
- I might.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.054
What?

16:52.137 --> 16:56.141
I don't know where he is,
but I think I know how to ask him.

17:05.442 --> 17:06.609
Whoa.

17:14.409 --> 17:15.702
I got it.

17:23.710 --> 17:27.256
Mike,
are you there? Mike?

17:27.339 --> 17:28.674
You guys hear that?

17:28.757 --> 17:30.884
Mike, it's me, Nancy.

17:33.178 --> 17:34.638
Mike, are you there?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.390
Answer.

17:36.473 --> 17:38.141
Mike, we need you to answer.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.768
Is that your sister?

17:40.727 --> 17:43.397
This is an emergency, Mike.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.773
Do you copy?

17:46.024 --> 17:47.442
Mike, do you copy?

17:47.526 --> 17:49.069
Okay, this is really weird.

17:49.152 --> 17:50.654
Don't answer.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.823
-She said it was an emergency.
-What if it's a trick?

17:52.906 --> 17:55.659
-It's your sister!
-What if the bad people kidnapped her?

17:55.742 --> 17:58.620
-What if they're forcing her to say this?
-I need you to answer.

17:58.704 --> 18:01.248
It's like Lando Calrissian.
Don't answer.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.083
We need to know
that you're there, Mike.

18:03.792 --> 18:06.628
Listen, kid, this is the chief.
If you're there, pick up.

18:06.712 --> 18:08.714
We know you're in trouble
and we know about the girl.

18:08.797 --> 18:10.841
Why is she with the chief?

18:10.924 --> 18:12.217
How the hell does he know about...

18:12.301 --> 18:16.221
We can protect you,
we can help you, but you gotta pick up.

18:16.305 --> 18:18.932
Are you there?
Do you copy? Over.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.858
Anybody got any other ideas?

18:29.443 --> 18:30.944
Yeah, I copy.

18:32.946 --> 18:33.989
It's Mike.

18:34.072 --> 18:35.407
I'm here.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.036
We're here.

18:48.670 --> 18:50.172
Need a hand?

18:51.798 --> 18:53.425
Did you have something
to do with this?

18:54.426 --> 18:55.594
I just...

18:56.595 --> 18:57.763
I wanna help.

19:06.104 --> 19:07.481
All yours.

19:20.327 --> 19:24.081
They expect us
to just sit here like prisoners.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.791
We should be out there looking for him.

19:25.874 --> 19:28.669
Honey, we have to trust them, okay?

19:28.752 --> 19:31.546
This is our government.
They're on our side.

19:34.049 --> 19:35.550
That man gives me the creeps.

19:38.095 --> 19:39.262
Nancy.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.807
You don't think
she's involved in this, too, do you?

19:41.890 --> 19:43.308
Nancy with Mike?

19:43.392 --> 19:44.851
No.

19:45.769 --> 19:47.938
- No.

19:59.449 --> 20:00.784
Will you stop pacing?

20:00.867 --> 20:02.828
It's been way too long.

20:02.911 --> 20:05.831
Do you know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe this is all a trap

20:05.914 --> 20:07.624
and the bad men
are coming to get us right now!

20:07.708 --> 20:08.709
It's not a trap.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.794
Why would the chief set us up?

20:10.877 --> 20:13.046
Nancy, maybe, but the chief?

20:13.130 --> 20:14.506
Lando Calrissian.

20:14.589 --> 20:16.258
Would you shut up about Lando?

20:16.341 --> 20:18.260
I don't feel good about this.
I don't feel good about this!

20:18.343 --> 20:20.178
When do you feel good
about anything?

20:32.190 --> 20:33.233
Shit!

20:33.316 --> 20:34.651
Go, go, go, go.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.613
Lando.

20:38.697 --> 20:40.449
You think they saw us?

20:40.532 --> 20:42.200
Both of you, shut up.

21:27.329 --> 21:28.455
- Hey!

21:29.915 --> 21:31.249
What the--

21:36.922 --> 21:38.924
All right, let's go.

21:40.634 --> 21:42.260
Let's go!

22:05.450 --> 22:07.786
Mike. Oh, my God. Mike!

22:11.623 --> 22:13.667
I was so worried about you.

22:13.750 --> 22:16.169
Yeah, uh... me, too.

22:21.550 --> 22:22.884
Is that my dress?

22:26.263 --> 22:29.558
Okay, so, in this example,
we're the acrobat.

22:29.641 --> 22:32.561
Will and Barbara, and that monster,
they're this flea.

22:32.644 --> 22:35.021
And this is the Upside Down,
where Will is hiding.

22:35.105 --> 22:38.567
Mr. Clarke said the only way to get there
is through a rip of time and space.

22:38.650 --> 22:40.235
-A gate.
-That we tracked to Hawkins Lab.

22:40.318 --> 22:41.611
With our compasses.

22:43.572 --> 22:46.825
Okay, so the gate
has a really strong electromagnetic field,

22:46.908 --> 22:49.119
and that can change
the directions of a compass needle.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.412
Is this gate underground?

22:50.495 --> 22:52.163
Yes.

22:53.498 --> 22:55.250
Near a large water tank?

22:55.959 --> 22:57.127
Yes.

22:58.003 --> 22:59.462
How do you know all that?

23:00.839 --> 23:02.632
He's seen it.

23:02.716 --> 23:04.551
Is there any way that you could...

23:05.844 --> 23:08.305
that you could reach Will?
That you could talk to him in this--

23:08.388 --> 23:09.472
The Upside Down.

23:09.556 --> 23:11.182
Down. Yeah.

23:12.851 --> 23:13.977
And my friend Barbara?

23:14.060 --> 23:15.520
Can you find her, too?

23:51.806 --> 23:52.849
I'm sorry.

23:52.932 --> 23:53.975
What?

23:54.059 --> 23:56.186
What's wrong?
What happened?

23:56.311 --> 23:58.938
I can't find them.

24:32.430 --> 24:34.724
Whenever she uses her powers,
she gets weak.

24:34.808 --> 24:37.352
The more energy she uses,
the more tired she gets.

24:37.435 --> 24:40.021
-Like, she flipped the van earlier.
-It was awesome.

24:40.105 --> 24:42.399
-But she's drained.
-Like a bad battery.

24:42.482 --> 24:45.360
Well...
How do we make her better?

24:45.443 --> 24:48.279
We don't.
We just have to wait and try again.

24:48.363 --> 24:50.198
Well, how long?

24:50.281 --> 24:51.658
I don't know.

24:51.741 --> 24:52.992
The bath.

24:53.076 --> 24:54.327
What?

24:56.955 --> 24:58.623
I can find them.

25:00.125 --> 25:01.167
In the bath.

25:06.381 --> 25:07.549
Oh!

25:09.718 --> 25:11.970
Oh. Oh, my...
No, mmm-mmm.

25:12.053 --> 25:14.055
Hey, you know how they did that?
You know what that is?

25:14.139 --> 25:15.390
No, what?

25:15.473 --> 25:18.017
Melted plastic
and microwaved bubble gum.

25:18.101 --> 25:19.978
No way. Really?

25:20.061 --> 25:21.604
Really.

25:24.107 --> 25:26.067
-What in the world?
-Do you want me to pause it?

25:26.151 --> 25:27.736
I'm sure it's just a wrong number.

25:30.697 --> 25:31.740
Hello?

25:31.823 --> 25:33.616
Mr. Clarke? It's Dustin.

25:33.700 --> 25:36.578
Dustin? Is everything okay?

25:36.661 --> 25:38.288
Yeah, yeah. I just, I...

25:38.371 --> 25:40.457
I have a science question.

25:40.540 --> 25:43.918
It's ten o'clock on Saturday.
Why don't we pick this up--

25:44.002 --> 25:46.963
Do you know anything
about sensory deprivation tanks?

25:47.046 --> 25:48.840
Specifically how to build one?

25:48.923 --> 25:51.885
Sensory deprivation?
What is this for?

25:52.594 --> 25:54.179
Fun.

25:54.262 --> 25:55.930
Okay. Well...

25:56.848 --> 25:59.184
Why don't we talk about it Monday?
After school, okay?

25:59.267 --> 26:01.728
You always say
we should never stop being curious.

26:01.811 --> 26:03.730
To always open any curiosity door we find.

26:03.813 --> 26:04.856
Dustin--

26:04.939 --> 26:07.567
Why are you keeping
this curiosity door locked?

26:10.195 --> 26:11.404
Uh-huh.

26:15.033 --> 26:16.451
Uh-huh. How much?

26:17.368 --> 26:18.411
Uh-huh.

26:19.704 --> 26:22.499
Yep, all right.
Yeah, we'll be careful.

26:22.582 --> 26:24.209
Definitely.
All right, Mr. Clarke.

26:24.292 --> 26:26.503
Yeah, I'll see you on Monday.
I'll see you on Monday, Mr. Clarke.

26:26.586 --> 26:27.962
Bye.

26:28.046 --> 26:30.340
Do you still have that kiddie pool
we bobbed for apples in?

26:30.423 --> 26:32.717
-I think so. Yeah.
-Yeah.

26:32.801 --> 26:34.469
Good. Then we just need salt.
Lots of it.

26:34.552 --> 26:36.262
How much is "lots"?

26:38.348 --> 26:39.432
1,500 pounds.

26:40.141 --> 26:42.227
Well, where are we gonna
get that much salt?

26:56.950 --> 26:58.326
Hey, wait.

26:58.409 --> 27:00.370
It's not gonna snow next week, is it?

27:00.453 --> 27:02.539
Worst case, no school.

27:02.622 --> 27:05.333
Even if we find Will in there...

27:05.416 --> 27:06.960
what are we gonna do about that thing?

27:07.043 --> 27:08.336
We're not gonna do anything.

27:08.419 --> 27:09.838
I don't want you
anywhere near this, all right?

27:09.921 --> 27:12.340
-Your mom's been through enough already.
-He's my brother.

27:12.423 --> 27:15.760
Listen to me.
I'm gonna find him. All right?

27:15.844 --> 27:17.387
You gotta trust me on this.

27:17.470 --> 27:19.180
I am going to find him.

27:25.728 --> 27:27.689
This damn thing is heavy.

27:33.903 --> 27:35.655
Come on.
It's upside down.

27:35.738 --> 27:36.990
No, this way.

27:39.868 --> 27:41.035
-Okay, um...
-How does this even work?

27:41.119 --> 27:43.621
- Try that side.
- Son of a bitch!

27:43.705 --> 27:45.707
-Pull it back. Pull it back.
-I am!

27:45.790 --> 27:48.418
- One, two, three.

27:48.501 --> 27:49.836
Shit!

27:58.177 --> 27:59.470
Ah.

27:59.554 --> 28:00.638
Stand back.

28:07.478 --> 28:09.105
Whoa.

28:18.907 --> 28:20.825
What did she even eat?

28:20.909 --> 28:23.536
- What?
- Eleven.

28:23.620 --> 28:27.874
Oh.
Candy, leftovers, Eggos...

28:29.375 --> 28:31.210
She really likes Eggos.

28:32.420 --> 28:34.505
I knew you
were acting weird. I just...

28:34.589 --> 28:36.633
I thought it was because of Will.

28:36.716 --> 28:39.594
I knew you were acting weird, too.
I thought it was 'cause of Steve.

28:41.012 --> 28:42.096
Hey...

28:44.224 --> 28:46.017
No more secrets, okay?

28:46.100 --> 28:48.144
From now on we tell each other everything.

28:48.228 --> 28:51.272
Okay. Do you like Jonathan now?

28:51.356 --> 28:53.316
What? No.

28:54.275 --> 28:57.070
No, it's... it's not...
it's not like that.

28:58.655 --> 28:59.906
Do you like Eleven?

28:59.989 --> 29:03.326
What? No. Ew. Gross.

29:16.214 --> 29:19.509
This will keep it dark for you.

29:19.592 --> 29:21.678
Just like in your bathtub.

29:24.806 --> 29:26.516
You're a very brave girl.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.393
You know that, don't you?

29:29.435 --> 29:33.398
Everything you're doing
for my boy... for Will...

29:34.899 --> 29:36.484
for my family...

29:38.611 --> 29:40.738
Thank you.

29:44.325 --> 29:45.576
Listen.

29:46.160 --> 29:49.956
I am gonna be there
with you the whole time.

29:50.039 --> 29:52.000
And if it ever gets too scary...

29:52.083 --> 29:56.462
in that place,
you just let me know, okay?

29:59.507 --> 30:00.550
Yes.

30:03.219 --> 30:04.262
Ready?

30:09.183 --> 30:10.226
Ready.

30:27.618 --> 30:29.203
Colder!

30:31.164 --> 30:32.457
Warmer!

30:34.792 --> 30:36.252
Right there!

32:54.098 --> 32:55.141
Barb?

32:55.224 --> 32:56.476
Barbara?

33:27.840 --> 33:29.884
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

33:30.843 --> 33:33.888
Is Barb okay?
Is she okay?

33:33.971 --> 33:35.973
Gone! Gone!

33:36.057 --> 33:37.808
Gone!

33:37.892 --> 33:40.561
Gone! Gone!

33:40.645 --> 33:42.939
Gone. Gone.

33:43.022 --> 33:44.524
--Gone.

33:44.607 --> 33:46.400
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

33:46.484 --> 33:48.778
- Gone. Gone!
- It's okay. It's okay.

33:48.861 --> 33:50.279
Gone!

33:50.363 --> 33:52.114
- Hey. It's okay.

33:52.198 --> 33:54.700
It's okay, we're right here.
We're right here, honey.

33:54.784 --> 33:58.037
It's okay. I got you.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.957
Don't be afraid.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.542
I'm right here with you.

34:02.625 --> 34:05.169
I'm right here with you.

34:05.253 --> 34:07.421
It's okay. It's okay.

34:07.505 --> 34:09.799
It's okay.

34:09.882 --> 34:12.009
It's okay, you're safe.

34:12.092 --> 34:13.469
You're okay, honey.

34:14.344 --> 34:15.972
Castle Byers.

34:16.556 --> 34:17.931
Castle Byers.

34:57.346 --> 34:58.389
Will.

34:58.472 --> 35:00.308
- Will?

35:05.730 --> 35:07.732
You tell him...
tell him I'm coming.

35:07.815 --> 35:09.317
Mom is coming.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.527
Your mom...
she's coming for you.

35:14.530 --> 35:15.531
Hurry.

35:16.115 --> 35:17.158
Hurry.

35:19.493 --> 35:22.622
Okay. Listen, you tell him to...
to stay where he is.

35:22.705 --> 35:25.708
We're coming. We're coming, okay?
We're coming, honey.

35:25.791 --> 35:28.044
Just... just hold on a little longer.

35:28.127 --> 35:30.212
Will. Will.

35:41.432 --> 35:42.558
Will?

35:43.476 --> 35:44.560
Will!

35:51.567 --> 35:53.277
--Oh!

35:53.361 --> 35:56.072
--Oh, okay, okay.

35:57.281 --> 35:58.324
I've got you.

35:59.784 --> 36:01.619
It's okay.
I got you. I got you.

36:02.244 --> 36:04.872
I got you, honey.
You did so good.

36:07.249 --> 36:09.335
- Are you okay?

36:10.628 --> 36:12.880
So this fort.
Where is it?

36:12.963 --> 36:14.757
Uh, it's in the woods
behind our house.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.259
Yeah, he used to go there to hide.

36:23.015 --> 36:24.266
Hey, get back inside.

36:24.350 --> 36:25.476
What, are you insane?

36:25.559 --> 36:26.852
-No, I'm--
-Look, if something happens to me,

36:26.936 --> 36:27.978
I don't make it back--

36:28.062 --> 36:29.772
Yeah, but then I'll go.
You stay.

36:29.855 --> 36:30.981
Are you kidding me?

36:31.065 --> 36:34.318
He's my son, Hop. My son.

36:34.402 --> 36:35.486
I'm going!

36:36.612 --> 36:38.322
- Now, listen, I need you to stay here...
- No.

36:38.406 --> 36:39.740
-...and watch over the kids.
-No, Mom.

36:39.824 --> 36:41.659
-I can help.
-Please, I need you to stay, Jonathan.

36:41.742 --> 36:42.743
Joyce!

36:42.827 --> 36:43.994
-Please.
-Please, be careful.

36:44.078 --> 36:45.621
- Joyce, come on!
- Please. I'm gonna find him.

36:45.705 --> 36:47.456
I'm gonna find him.

37:21.782 --> 37:23.826
We have to go back to the station.

37:25.286 --> 37:26.328
What?

37:27.246 --> 37:32.835
Your mom and Hopper
are just walking in there like bait.

37:33.919 --> 37:36.839
That thing is still in there.

37:38.883 --> 37:42.261
And we can't just sit here
and let it get them, too.

37:42.344 --> 37:43.637
We can't.

37:47.767 --> 37:49.977
You still wanna try it out?

37:50.728 --> 37:53.063
I wanna finish what we started.

37:54.774 --> 37:56.650
I want to kill it.

38:11.165 --> 38:12.708
So this is your plan?

38:12.792 --> 38:14.502
Worked for me before, didn't it?

38:14.585 --> 38:16.796
-Well, did it?
-Come on, trust me.

38:18.047 --> 38:20.007
I'd like to hear
your thoughts on the war.

38:20.090 --> 38:22.092
I think we're dealing with a whole
different environment here.

38:22.176 --> 38:23.844
I'll tell you what,
we always planned

38:23.928 --> 38:26.222
on the Russians massing the fire and we...

38:43.864 --> 38:44.949
--Don't move!

38:45.991 --> 38:47.701
- All right, move in.

38:47.785 --> 38:49.245
It's all right.

38:49.328 --> 38:50.704
Let me do the talking.

38:57.419 --> 38:59.588
♪ If I go there will be trouble ♪

39:00.840 --> 39:03.634
♪ And if I stay it will be double ♪

39:04.718 --> 39:07.429
♪ So, come on and let me know ♪

39:08.472 --> 39:10.558
♪ Should I stay or should I go now? ♪
