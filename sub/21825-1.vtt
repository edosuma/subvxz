10:29.543 --> 10:30.610
Hey, what's up?

10:30.644 --> 10:32.612
Hey, man, come on in.

10:32.646 --> 10:33.780
Figured I'd introduce myself
since we're gonna be working

10:33.813 --> 10:35.315
full shifts together.

10:35.349 --> 10:37.717
Translation: you want to
make sure I'm not a jerk.

10:37.751 --> 10:38.952
Something like that.

10:38.985 --> 10:41.321
Dude, I'm such a jerk,
it's ridiculous.

10:41.355 --> 10:43.190
Okay, well, so am I,
so this is gonna work out great.

10:43.223 --> 10:44.891
Gordon Malloy.
John Lamarr.

10:44.924 --> 10:46.626
Cool.

10:46.660 --> 10:48.862
So, I heard you've been out
of commission for a minute.

10:48.895 --> 10:51.165
Well, not out of commission,
but, uh,

10:51.198 --> 10:54.068
definitely kept on desk duty.
Well, what'd you do?

10:54.101 --> 10:56.570
I mean, your piloting skills
are kind of legendary.

10:56.603 --> 10:57.871
How'd you get suspended?

10:57.904 --> 10:59.339
I let my cousin shoot a porno

10:59.373 --> 11:01.641
in the back of a shuttle
in exchange for some pills.

11:01.675 --> 11:04.378
W-Wait. No. R-Really?

11:04.411 --> 11:07.381
(laughs):
Man, look at your face.

11:07.414 --> 11:09.049
No, no, no, I did a,
I did a manual override

11:09.083 --> 11:10.550
on a tricky shuttle docking

11:10.584 --> 11:12.586
and sheared off
a cargo bay door.

11:12.619 --> 11:14.888
Yeah, nobody was hurt,
but 300 crates

11:14.921 --> 11:17.424
of authentic autumn squash
were sucked into space.

11:17.457 --> 11:19.259
Well, that's a lot
of damn squash.

11:19.293 --> 11:21.261
Yeah. I was trying
to impress a girl.

11:21.295 --> 11:22.662
Ah, I can respect that.

11:22.696 --> 11:24.264
Needless to say it didn't
go over too well.

11:24.298 --> 11:26.066
If it weren't for Ed,
I probably wouldn't

11:26.100 --> 11:29.002
be back at the helm for a lot
longer than this, if ever.

11:29.035 --> 11:31.071
Well, just steer with your head
from now on,

11:31.105 --> 11:32.406
and you'll be okay.

11:32.439 --> 11:33.440
Yeah.

11:33.473 --> 11:36.410
See you on the bridge.

11:45.819 --> 11:47.587
HALSEY: I wish I could give you
something more exciting

11:47.621 --> 11:50.090
for your maiden voyage,
but it's pretty straightforward.

11:50.124 --> 11:51.425
You'll be delivering supplies

11:51.458 --> 11:54.027
to the science station
on Epsilon 2.

11:54.060 --> 11:55.395
Hey, sir, I'm not
complaining.

11:55.429 --> 11:57.063
It'll be great
just to be out there.

11:57.097 --> 11:59.766
Uh, is there any word yet
on a first officer?

11:59.799 --> 12:02.035
I should have an update
in a few hours.

12:02.068 --> 12:04.704
Sounds like you won't have
to wait much longer.

12:04.738 --> 12:07.141
Safe travels, Captain.

12:09.409 --> 12:10.444
Captain.

12:25.125 --> 12:27.427
Captain, we've received
the green light

12:27.461 --> 12:30.764
from dockyard tower, and
we're cleared for departure.

12:30.797 --> 12:32.098
Tell them we're good to go.

12:32.132 --> 12:35.435
Lieutenant Malloy, take us out.

12:35.469 --> 12:38.172
Aye, sir.
Departing dockyard.

13:07.301 --> 13:09.236
♪

13:33.527 --> 13:35.429
♪

13:45.372 --> 13:49.175
Dockyard perimeter cleared.

13:51.211 --> 13:55.014
Set course for Epsilon
and engage quantum drive.

13:55.048 --> 13:58.452
Course set, drive engaged.

14:12.732 --> 14:15.835
ETA: 19 hours, 51 minutes.

14:15.869 --> 14:17.504
I've never been to
the Epsilon Science Station.

14:17.537 --> 14:19.239
What's it like? BORTUS:
Epsilon 2 is an outpost

14:19.273 --> 14:22.075
devoted exclusively
to scientific inquiry.

14:22.108 --> 14:23.577
ED:
Researchers

14:23.610 --> 14:25.845
from all over the galaxy
petition to work there.

14:25.879 --> 14:28.348
Really? Wow.

14:28.382 --> 14:29.416
Any good bars?

14:29.449 --> 14:30.784
I will investigate.

14:30.817 --> 14:32.852
No, Bortus, you don't have
to investigate that.

14:32.886 --> 14:34.754
I have already obtained
the information.

14:34.788 --> 14:36.523
Oh.
Shall I withhold it?

14:36.556 --> 14:37.591
No, you can tell us.

14:37.624 --> 14:38.858
There are no bars.

14:38.892 --> 14:40.126
How about strip clubs?

14:40.159 --> 14:41.295
Gordon.
Sorry.

14:41.328 --> 14:42.462
There are no strip clubs.

14:42.496 --> 14:44.464
Captain, there's a message
coming in

14:44.498 --> 14:45.765
from Admiral Halsey.

14:45.799 --> 14:47.301
It says that
an executive officer

14:47.334 --> 14:48.868
has become available
and can rendezvous

14:48.902 --> 14:51.538
with the Orville
at station 794.

14:51.571 --> 14:53.206
That's great.
That's barely out of our way.

14:53.239 --> 14:54.708
Who is it?

14:54.741 --> 14:58.144
He wants me to forward it
to you privately.

14:58.177 --> 15:01.147
All right, send it
to my station.

15:04.518 --> 15:05.752
No.

15:05.785 --> 15:07.387
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

15:07.421 --> 15:09.389
What's the matter?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

15:09.423 --> 15:12.959
no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:12.992 --> 15:15.495
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:15.529 --> 15:17.831
Ah, crap!
Sorry, man, you okay?

15:17.864 --> 15:19.098
Yeah, it's all good, man.
You okay?

15:19.132 --> 15:20.800
Yeah, all good. Sorry.
All right, no worries.

15:22.168 --> 15:24.604
Calm down, Ed, and be
professional about this.

15:24.638 --> 15:25.839
Oh, please,
there is nothing at all

15:25.872 --> 15:27.607
professional
about this situation.

15:27.641 --> 15:29.008
Okay, this is my ex-wife,

15:29.042 --> 15:30.610
who I have not seen
since my divorce

15:30.644 --> 15:33.513
a year ago after I walked in on
her banging a Retepsian.

15:33.547 --> 15:35.248
I know this isn't ideal,

15:35.281 --> 15:36.916
but she's the only qualified
XO available.

15:36.950 --> 15:39.152
And the staff profile
compatibility program

15:39.185 --> 15:41.988
indicated your skill sets
complement hers.

15:42.021 --> 15:44.290
Oh, it did? See if your
compatibility program

15:44.324 --> 15:46.125
can get blue
out of a white lampshade.

15:46.159 --> 15:47.994
Ed, you need
to calm yourself here.

15:48.027 --> 15:49.629
God, I can't even believe
this is happening.

15:49.663 --> 15:51.130
Look, she is the only
current option,

15:51.164 --> 15:53.032
and if you make a stink
about an XO assignment

15:53.066 --> 15:55.602
one day into your first command,

15:55.635 --> 15:56.770
with your record,

15:56.803 --> 15:58.472
it's not gonna look good.

15:58.505 --> 16:00.340
And you're telling me
she's okay with this?

16:00.374 --> 16:02.075
Ed, she requested it.

16:31.405 --> 16:32.972
(console beeps)

16:33.006 --> 16:34.574
Sir, Shuttle Bay reports

16:34.608 --> 16:37.210
the XO's shuttle has docked.

16:37.243 --> 16:38.244
Can you tell her to come
straight to my office?

16:38.277 --> 16:40.747
Aye, sir.

16:40.780 --> 16:42.416
The captain does not
appear to be pleased

16:42.449 --> 16:44.884
at the arrival
of his first officer.

16:44.918 --> 16:45.919
Why is this?

16:45.952 --> 16:47.421
'Cause she's a total bitch.

16:47.454 --> 16:48.422
Do you know her?

16:48.455 --> 16:50.557
Oh, yeah.
They were married.

16:50.590 --> 16:51.825
No way.

16:51.858 --> 16:53.927
She cheated on him.
Aw, damn, that's cold.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.396
Yeah, so this should be
a really fun trip for all of us.

16:56.430 --> 16:58.064
Your description
of the occurrence

16:58.097 --> 16:59.766
indicates unpleasantness,

16:59.799 --> 17:01.901
yet you believe it will be fun.

17:01.935 --> 17:04.270
I was being sarcastic.
It's gonna suck.

17:04.303 --> 17:07.607
Suck? Yeah, suck. You
know, like, ass, balls.

17:07.641 --> 17:09.543
What he means is,
if you don't already drink,

17:09.576 --> 17:11.044
you should probably start.

17:11.077 --> 17:12.879
Perhaps we should not
be talking about this.

17:12.912 --> 17:14.514
Oh, no, no, no, we're,
we're talking about this.

17:14.548 --> 17:15.915
It does not seem
appropriate.

17:15.949 --> 17:17.016
Oh, no, we're definitely
talking about it.

17:17.050 --> 17:18.752
Th-Th-This is a thing.

17:21.488 --> 17:23.289
(door chimes)

17:25.391 --> 17:27.794
(sighs) Come in.

17:30.897 --> 17:31.965
Hi.

17:31.998 --> 17:34.534
Hi.

17:34.568 --> 17:36.470
Can I come in?

17:40.974 --> 17:42.576
It's a nice office.

17:42.609 --> 17:44.210
Thank you.

17:44.243 --> 17:45.378
Did you pick out the furniture?

17:45.411 --> 17:46.980
You know, I didn't,
but if you're really

17:47.013 --> 17:48.748
interested in the furniture,
I'd be happy to get

17:48.782 --> 17:50.249
all the information
I can about it.

17:50.283 --> 17:51.785
I could have somebody
compile a full report

17:51.818 --> 17:53.887
and have it sent to your
quarters this afternoon.

17:53.920 --> 17:56.289
Maybe you'd find something nice
for your new apartment.

17:56.322 --> 17:57.457
Are you all finished?

17:57.491 --> 17:58.825
Well, you know, I thought I was,

17:58.858 --> 18:01.327
but, apparently, you're not.

18:01.360 --> 18:04.263
Ed...

18:04.297 --> 18:06.399
I can't apologize enough.

18:06.432 --> 18:08.434
I know it doesn't
matter to you,

18:08.468 --> 18:10.570
but I-I am sorrier
for what I did to you

18:10.604 --> 18:12.739
than anything I've ever
done in my entire life.

18:12.772 --> 18:14.107
You know, I've done

18:14.140 --> 18:16.843
a pretty good job
getting over all this

18:16.876 --> 18:18.778
in the past year,

18:18.812 --> 18:21.915
and I'm over it,
so why don't you tell me

18:21.948 --> 18:23.116
what the hell you're doing here?

18:23.149 --> 18:25.084
I heard about
your promotion.

18:25.118 --> 18:27.086
I also heard there was
no XO available,

18:27.120 --> 18:29.255
and you know how the
fleet admirals are.

18:29.288 --> 18:31.591
They don't like to see a captain
on his own for too long.

18:31.625 --> 18:35.829
And I figured
I'd wronged you so badly

18:35.862 --> 18:38.264
that if there was something
good I could do for you,

18:38.297 --> 18:40.500
it'd help me atone in some way.

18:40.534 --> 18:42.702
So I requested a transfer.

18:42.736 --> 18:44.871
I literally bailed on my own
crewmates to come here.

18:44.904 --> 18:46.339
Well, you bailed
on a whole marriage,

18:46.372 --> 18:48.274
so I imagine that was
a piece of cake for you, huh?

18:48.307 --> 18:50.043
Ed, look, I'm not saying
what I did wasn't disgraceful,

18:50.076 --> 18:52.045
but I only did it
because I didn't have you.

18:52.078 --> 18:55.014
(laughs): There it is.
How long did that take you?

18:55.048 --> 18:57.517
How many minutes into this conversation?
You were working nonstop.

18:57.551 --> 18:58.952
Okay, there were
entire days

18:58.985 --> 19:00.554
I wouldn't see you.
Yeah, I was working for us,

19:00.587 --> 19:02.822
Kelly, for you and I.
That-- you know this.

19:02.856 --> 19:04.490
I didn't ask you to do that.

19:04.524 --> 19:06.059
Okay? Y-You just shut off
from our relationship.

19:06.092 --> 19:07.561
I-I didn't know
how to handle it.

19:07.594 --> 19:09.295
So you banged Papa Smurf
in our bed.

19:09.328 --> 19:11.297
That's one way to handle it. Darulio
was there when you weren't.

19:11.330 --> 19:12.498
And you know how
many times I tried

19:12.532 --> 19:13.967
to talk to you, but you just
kept putting me off?

19:14.000 --> 19:15.301
Whe-When did you try
to talk to me?

19:15.334 --> 19:17.136
So many times. Where it
wasn't, like, an insidious,

19:17.170 --> 19:18.404
subtle, sarcastic...
Either you weren't hearing me

19:18.437 --> 19:19.873
or you weren't around
at all, but I did try.

19:19.906 --> 19:20.874
I was the one who suggested
couples counseling.

19:20.907 --> 19:21.975
Couples counseling?

19:22.008 --> 19:23.409
The therapist was
your brother-in-law.

19:23.442 --> 19:26.580
Look, this-- okay-- this ship

19:26.613 --> 19:29.082
is what I've been waiting for
my entire career.

19:29.115 --> 19:30.917
My entire life.

19:30.950 --> 19:32.752
So why are you doing this to me?

19:34.621 --> 19:37.591
As soon as another XO
becomes available,

19:37.624 --> 19:39.458
I'll be the one
to request a transfer.

19:45.298 --> 19:47.266
(door whooshes open)

20:07.453 --> 20:09.956
Whoa, hey.

20:09.989 --> 20:11.625
Hi there.

20:11.658 --> 20:14.761
I was just on my
way to the john.

20:14.794 --> 20:17.296
Well, I'm-I'm glad
I bumped into you.

20:17.330 --> 20:18.598
Do you have a second?

20:18.632 --> 20:20.433
Sure. I can hold it.

20:20.466 --> 20:24.103
Okay. Gordon, I just want to make sure...
You know what?

20:24.137 --> 20:26.606
You should probably call
me Lieutenant Malloy,

20:26.640 --> 20:29.743
seeing as how you're
my boss now... sir.

20:29.776 --> 20:32.578
Right. Lieutenant.

20:32.612 --> 20:33.647
I just want to
make sure that

20:33.680 --> 20:35.749
everything's all right
between us.

20:35.782 --> 20:37.617
I mean, I'm assuming that
you and Ed are still close.

20:37.651 --> 20:38.785
Yeah.

20:38.818 --> 20:42.421
Yeah, and...

20:42.455 --> 20:45.591
what happened between Ed and I,
that-- it was a mistake.

20:45.625 --> 20:48.594
A big one.
And, um,

20:48.628 --> 20:50.429
I guess I just want to know
that you're gonna be okay

20:50.463 --> 20:51.765
taking orders from me.

20:51.798 --> 20:53.432
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, no, no.

20:53.466 --> 20:55.434
I'm a professional,
don't worry about that.

20:55.468 --> 20:56.803
That's good to hear.

20:56.836 --> 20:58.304
Actually, the folks
up on the bridge

20:58.337 --> 20:59.673
were asking
about you earlier,

20:59.706 --> 21:01.440
and I was telling them
you're actually

21:01.474 --> 21:03.943
a really cool person.
Really?

21:03.977 --> 21:06.980
I kind of primed the pump
for you up there, you know.

21:07.013 --> 21:08.414
All good vibes.

21:08.447 --> 21:10.583
That's very magnanimous
of you.

21:10.616 --> 21:14.187
I got you.
I got you.

21:14.220 --> 21:15.655
(sighs)

21:15.689 --> 21:18.624
So, um,
permission to pee?

21:18.658 --> 21:20.293
Oh. (chuckles):
Granted, yes.

21:20.326 --> 21:22.461
Sweet, sweet.

21:22.495 --> 21:25.131
Hey, I'm gonna go look up
what "magnanimous" means.

21:25.164 --> 21:27.500
Great.
Great.

21:27.533 --> 21:29.168
I mean, pee first, though.

21:29.202 --> 21:30.336
Priorities.

21:30.369 --> 21:32.672
(laughing):
You know it.

21:36.976 --> 21:39.879
♪

21:53.326 --> 21:55.695
Entering orbit
of Epsilon 2.

21:55.729 --> 21:56.896
Lieutenant Kitan,

21:56.930 --> 21:58.197
signal them we're ready.

21:58.231 --> 21:59.565
ALARA:
Aye, Commander.

21:59.598 --> 22:02.301
Man, you could cut
the tension with a knife.

22:02.335 --> 22:03.903
Do not make eye contact.

22:03.937 --> 22:05.371
Orville to Epsilon
Science Station.

22:05.404 --> 22:08.708
We're here and ready
to bring down supplies.

22:08.742 --> 22:09.909
Orville, this is Dr. Aronov.

22:09.943 --> 22:11.210
I am chief of this facility.

22:11.244 --> 22:12.378
May I speak to your captain?

22:12.411 --> 22:13.646
Put him on the viewer.

22:13.679 --> 22:16.582
Dr. Aronov, this is
Captain Ed Mercer.

22:16.615 --> 22:18.752
We're about to start
sending down your supplies.

22:18.785 --> 22:22.822
Actually, Captain,
we-we don't need any supplies.

22:22.856 --> 22:24.758
I-I don't understand.

22:24.791 --> 22:26.159
You requested these
supplies yourself, yeah?

22:26.192 --> 22:27.326
I did.

22:27.360 --> 22:28.594
I'm sorry.

22:28.627 --> 22:30.429
I-I wouldn't have lied
unless I had to.

22:30.463 --> 22:32.431
Please, come down
to the surface.

22:32.465 --> 22:34.400
I will explain everything.

22:34.433 --> 22:36.069
This is really strange.

22:36.102 --> 22:37.570
Yeah, it's a great way
to start things off.

22:37.603 --> 22:39.072
Bortus, you have the conn.

22:39.105 --> 22:40.273
Lieutenant,
you're with us.

22:40.306 --> 22:41.707
You see that dog
in the background

22:41.741 --> 22:42.942
licking his balls?

22:42.976 --> 22:44.778
First thing I saw.

23:06.766 --> 23:10.770
MAN: Prepare for Orville
shuttle arrival, Bay 3.

23:17.443 --> 23:18.711
Captain Mercer.

23:18.744 --> 23:19.813
Welcome to Epsilon 2.

23:19.846 --> 23:21.547
Thank you for coming.
Dr. Aronov.

23:21.580 --> 23:23.983
This is my security
chief, Alara Kitan. Hi.

23:24.017 --> 23:26.752
My chief medical officer, Claire Finn.
Pleasure.

23:26.786 --> 23:28.387
And my ex-wife,
Kelly Grayson.

23:28.421 --> 23:29.789
I'm his first officer.

23:29.823 --> 23:30.924
Ah.

23:30.957 --> 23:32.391
But if any of your
research team

23:32.425 --> 23:34.160
needs an artless,
jabby-nail shoulder massage,

23:34.193 --> 23:35.661
she's the best there is.

23:35.694 --> 23:37.831
Doctor, you want to tell us
why you falsely diverted

23:37.864 --> 23:39.465
a starship on active duty?

23:39.498 --> 23:41.167
You know you could
do time for that.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.401
We need protection.

23:42.435 --> 23:43.736
Protection from what?

23:43.769 --> 23:44.971
The Krill.

23:45.004 --> 23:46.973
There have been no Krill
ships sighted in this area.

23:47.006 --> 23:49.175
Come inside. I'll explain.

23:58.517 --> 23:59.485
(indistinct voice
over P.A. system)

23:59.518 --> 24:02.088
Wow. No wonder
they call this place

24:02.121 --> 24:03.689
the scientists'
playground.

24:03.722 --> 24:05.925
Incredible, isn't it?
Yeah.

24:05.959 --> 24:08.794
Here. Follow me through
the botany lab.

24:13.900 --> 24:16.369
We're doing genetic research
and development here

24:16.402 --> 24:17.803
that will change
the face of the galaxy.

24:24.743 --> 24:25.912
(shouts)

24:27.080 --> 24:29.615
(chirping)

24:29.648 --> 24:31.050
Is that one of
your projects?

24:31.084 --> 24:33.352
No, no, that's Dr. Jorvik,
our chief botanist.

24:33.386 --> 24:34.988
Keep up, please.

24:39.258 --> 24:41.394
What sort of research
are you doing here?

24:41.427 --> 24:43.229
Oh, well, uh...

24:43.262 --> 24:44.864
this is a redwood seed.

24:44.898 --> 24:46.966
Looks pretty ordinary, yes?
KELLY: Sure.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.336
Well, this seed has been
genetically engineered

24:50.369 --> 24:51.905
with tardigrade DNA,

24:51.938 --> 24:54.573
which means it can survive
and grow in anything.

24:54.607 --> 24:56.242
Rock, metal, sand.

24:56.275 --> 24:58.211
It can exist a hundred
years without water.

24:58.244 --> 25:00.213
You can toss this seed in
the middle of the Sahara,

25:00.246 --> 25:02.748
and in a century you'll
have a towering redwood.

25:02.781 --> 25:04.650
That's really impressive.

25:04.683 --> 25:06.585
And as a bonus,
a healthy snack.

25:06.619 --> 25:07.820
Here, try some.

25:07.853 --> 25:08.888
(Mercer sighs)

25:11.390 --> 25:12.926
Yeah, it's very tasty.

25:12.959 --> 25:16.495
Listen, Dr. Aronov,
why are we here?

25:16.529 --> 25:20.033
I couldn't tell you the real
reason we needed a Union ship

25:20.066 --> 25:21.734
because I couldn't risk

25:21.767 --> 25:24.237
divulging the information
over open communications.

25:24.270 --> 25:26.239
This way.

25:26.272 --> 25:28.607
(sighs)

25:36.315 --> 25:40.253
This is Janice Lee, one of our
most brilliant young physicists.

25:40.286 --> 25:41.687
Hello.
Hi.

25:41.720 --> 25:44.423
Janice has been experimenting
with temporal fields

25:44.457 --> 25:46.259
and has made--
well, a breakthrough

25:46.292 --> 25:47.626
would be an understatement.

26:00.173 --> 26:03.242
So, it's
an anti-banana ray?

26:03.276 --> 26:04.543
It's really interesting.

26:04.577 --> 26:06.112
We need no longer
fear the banana.

26:06.145 --> 26:08.081
Does it work on all fruit?
What about salads?

26:08.114 --> 26:10.649
Do you understand what happened
to this banana?

26:10.683 --> 26:12.118
It's rotten

26:12.151 --> 26:13.953
because a month has passed.

26:13.987 --> 26:15.121
Since we got here? Yeah,
that's what it feels like.

26:15.154 --> 26:16.555
LEE:
Captain Mercer,

26:16.589 --> 26:18.757
this banana is suspended
in a quantum bubble

26:18.791 --> 26:20.759
that can be adjusted
to accelerate time.

26:20.793 --> 26:23.129
Out here only a few
moments have passed.

26:23.162 --> 26:26.299
Inside the bubble, it's
a month in the future.

26:26.332 --> 26:27.933
Does it work in
both directions?

26:27.967 --> 26:29.735
Like, could somebody use it
to go backward in time

26:29.768 --> 26:30.970
and tell their younger self

26:31.004 --> 26:32.471
not to make
a terrible life decision?

26:32.505 --> 26:34.140
Hey, will you give it a rest
for, like, five minutes?

26:34.173 --> 26:35.841
No, I didn't mean that-that...
I know what you meant.

26:35.874 --> 26:37.076
No, I just meant,
like, tell yourself

26:37.110 --> 26:38.677
not to break your leg
in that fall

26:38.711 --> 26:40.179
or don't eat too many carbs

26:40.213 --> 26:42.915
or-or don't get married,
but is that how it works?

26:42.948 --> 26:44.150
No, the field
can only accelerate

26:44.183 --> 26:45.584
the forward pace of time.

26:45.618 --> 26:47.086
Captain...

26:47.120 --> 26:48.421
we have figured out a way

26:48.454 --> 26:49.922
to use quantum field technology

26:49.955 --> 26:53.459
to manipulate
the speed of events.

26:53.492 --> 26:55.161
CLAIRE: Sir, I've read
about this hypothetical.

26:55.194 --> 26:57.596
Quantum field manipulation
of the flow of time

26:57.630 --> 26:59.498
is theoretically possible.

26:59.532 --> 27:02.268
Wait, so...
so you're serious?

27:02.301 --> 27:04.437
My God. ARONOV: Think
of the benefits.

27:04.470 --> 27:06.439
Entire crops grown
in the blink of an eye.

27:06.472 --> 27:07.973
Starving populations

27:08.007 --> 27:09.942
supplied with limitless
amounts of food overnight.

27:09.975 --> 27:12.111
Life-threatening wounds
healed...

27:12.145 --> 27:14.147
(snaps fingers) ...instantly.
Or entire armies

27:14.180 --> 27:16.115
reduced to frail elders
instantly.

27:16.149 --> 27:18.451
You do realize this could
also be used as a weapon.

27:18.484 --> 27:19.685
That's why you're here.

27:19.718 --> 27:22.055
We couldn't risk sending
word to the Union fleet

27:22.088 --> 27:23.222
about what we'd discovered.

27:23.256 --> 27:24.490
If the Krill intercepted it,

27:24.523 --> 27:26.059
they could've been here
long before you.

27:26.092 --> 27:27.726
Well, we're only one ship
and not a big one,

27:27.760 --> 27:29.628
so we better get help.

27:29.662 --> 27:31.564
How fast does the field
of acceleration go?

27:31.597 --> 27:34.067
How would you like to see
a 100-year-old banana?

27:34.100 --> 27:35.768
Watch this.

27:38.271 --> 27:39.738
Mercer to Bortus.

27:39.772 --> 27:41.040
Bortus here, sir.

27:41.074 --> 27:43.042
Get a coded message
to Union Central

27:43.076 --> 27:44.910
that Epsilon 2 is
in possession of a...

27:44.943 --> 27:47.746
Put down that
comscanner, Captain.

27:56.789 --> 27:59.158
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What
is this? What's going on?

27:59.192 --> 28:00.426
Put down that comscanner

28:00.459 --> 28:02.395
and drop all your
weapons now.

28:02.428 --> 28:03.529
Listen, I don't know
what you're trying to...

28:06.899 --> 28:08.601
Okay, okay, relax.

28:08.634 --> 28:09.735
Move.

28:09.768 --> 28:11.437
ARONOV: Derek, what
the hell are you doing?

28:11.470 --> 28:12.605
(whispering):
Oh, of course it's a Derek.

28:12.638 --> 28:13.772
Who is this man?

28:13.806 --> 28:15.274
Derek Ashton, he's
a lab technician.

28:15.308 --> 28:17.376
He's been here
over a year.

28:17.410 --> 28:19.112
I don't understand this.
Explain yourself.

28:19.145 --> 28:21.680
Ashton to Krill vessel.
It's time.

28:21.714 --> 28:23.282
Derek, listen to me.
Don't do this.

28:23.316 --> 28:24.217
Back off!

28:24.250 --> 28:26.152
(screaming)

28:31.890 --> 28:34.193
Back off! Back off.
Look, you...

28:34.227 --> 28:35.394
Stay back! Stay
where you are.

28:35.428 --> 28:36.695
Bortus to Captain Mercer.

28:36.729 --> 28:37.930
We've just detected

28:37.963 --> 28:39.465
a Krill destroyer
entering orbit.

28:50.075 --> 28:51.477
Raise deflector screens.

28:51.510 --> 28:52.445
Deflector screens up.

29:03.522 --> 29:06.925
Two Krill shuttles
are heading for the surface.

29:06.959 --> 29:09.762
Captain, there are Krill
soldiers heading down to you.

29:09.795 --> 29:11.597
Captain.

29:11.630 --> 29:12.898
God, there's no way

29:12.931 --> 29:15.234
we're gonna be out
by 5:00 today, are we?

29:15.268 --> 29:17.002
BORTUS:
Captain. Do you read?

29:17.035 --> 29:18.837
ASHTON:
Answer him.

29:18.871 --> 29:20.339
Tell him the Krill
come in peace

29:20.373 --> 29:22.107
and to stand down all weapons.
They won't believe me.

29:22.141 --> 29:23.108
Do it!
Listen, I...

29:23.142 --> 29:25.010
Do it now!
Okay.

29:25.043 --> 29:27.079
BORTUS:
Captain, do you read?

29:27.112 --> 29:28.581
Please respond.
Say something!

29:28.614 --> 29:30.149
Mercer to Bortus.

29:30.183 --> 29:32.418
The Krill are here in peace.
Uh...

29:32.451 --> 29:34.520
They just came down for...

29:34.553 --> 29:36.855
The lab is having a pizza party
and the Krill are invited.

29:36.889 --> 29:39.358
Oh, man, can we go? Oh, Bortus,
can we please go down there?

29:39.392 --> 29:40.859
Did you say...

29:40.893 --> 29:42.261
a pizza party?

29:42.295 --> 29:44.497
It's for office birthdays.

29:44.530 --> 29:46.699
Lot of September
birthdays down here.

29:48.133 --> 29:49.235
(grunts)

29:50.703 --> 29:52.205
Alara, good work.

29:52.238 --> 29:54.373
Bortus, the Krill
are here to attack.

29:54.407 --> 29:56.008
Keep the weapons charged
and the deflectors up

29:56.041 --> 29:57.210
until we can get to you.

29:57.243 --> 29:58.844
There is no pizza party.
I repeat,

29:58.877 --> 30:00.613
there is no pizza party.

30:00.646 --> 30:02.848
She's dead.

30:02.881 --> 30:06.385
My God, she must be over 125 years old.
Dr. Aronov,

30:06.419 --> 30:08.787
we have to get the device back
to the Orville. What do we need?

30:08.821 --> 30:12.157
Detach the main generator
and grab the controller device.

30:20.866 --> 30:23.168
(soldier speaking Krill)

30:34.413 --> 30:35.914
BORTUS:
Orville to Krill ship.

30:35.948 --> 30:39.218
Call off your attack on the
surface or we will respond.

30:39.252 --> 30:40.953
The Krill are powering weapons.

30:49.061 --> 30:50.863
Deflectors are
at two-thirds power.

30:50.896 --> 30:52.064
Return fire.

30:56.769 --> 30:59.338
(speaks Krill)

30:59.372 --> 31:01.740
Back, back,
back, back, back.

31:01.774 --> 31:04.343
(people shouting)

31:04.377 --> 31:05.678
Doc, is there another way
out of here?

31:05.711 --> 31:06.745
There's an old
loading conduit,

31:06.779 --> 31:07.913
but it's across the atrium.

31:07.946 --> 31:09.415
We're gonna have
to sprint for it.

31:09.448 --> 31:10.916
All right, get ready.
Doc, stay behind Alara.

31:10.949 --> 31:12.017
Which one's Alara?

31:12.050 --> 31:13.419
Oh, I'm Alara.

31:13.452 --> 31:14.620
Sorry, still
learning names.

31:19.458 --> 31:20.926
Now.

31:23.161 --> 31:24.763
(shouts)

31:24.797 --> 31:25.931
(grunts)

31:27.333 --> 31:29.234
(grunts)

31:49.455 --> 31:50.589
(beeping)

31:52.358 --> 31:54.293
Ka'vaska!

32:01.099 --> 32:02.301
Deflectors at half power.

32:02.335 --> 32:04.337
Sir, I think I can
buy us some time

32:04.370 --> 32:06.939
till we can get the landing
party back. Let me wing it here?

32:06.972 --> 32:08.173
Proceed.

32:08.206 --> 32:11.410
This is something I call
"hugging the donkey."

32:11.444 --> 32:13.011
You can hug the donkey?

32:13.045 --> 32:14.480
Dude, I've been hugging the
donkey since flight school.

32:27.960 --> 32:30.796
(whooping, laughing)

32:30.829 --> 32:32.631
Round and round she goes!

32:32.665 --> 32:33.666
Ha, ha!

32:46.579 --> 32:48.347
It's dead.

32:48.381 --> 32:49.782
(grunts)

32:49.815 --> 32:51.850
Door's jammed.

32:51.884 --> 32:54.987
Alara. You want to open
this jar of pickles for me?

32:59.257 --> 33:00.859
(grunts)

33:03.161 --> 33:05.698
I loosened it for you.

33:09.234 --> 33:10.569
(growls)

33:10.603 --> 33:12.405
Alara, get the device
back to the shuttle.

33:12.438 --> 33:14.740
We'll cover you.
Got it.

33:31.457 --> 33:32.658
(panting)

33:32.691 --> 33:34.427
Okay.

33:34.460 --> 33:36.395
(weapons firing in distance)

33:38.931 --> 33:40.799
(whirring)

33:44.437 --> 33:45.370
(growls)

33:49.408 --> 33:51.309
(groans)

33:54.312 --> 33:56.715
Everybody, strap in.

33:59.618 --> 34:00.953
Shuttle to Orville,
we're on our way.

34:09.428 --> 34:11.497
Captain, let me see
that shoulder.

34:12.898 --> 34:14.967
Does it hurt?
Yeah, it hurts like hell.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.602
That means it's not that bad.

34:16.635 --> 34:17.736
What are you talking about,
Kelly?

34:17.770 --> 34:19.472
I literally just said
it hurts like hell.

34:19.505 --> 34:21.273
When he's really in pain,
he gives straight answers

34:21.306 --> 34:22.541
with no cussing.

34:22.575 --> 34:23.976
He's just hoping
you give him drugs.

34:24.009 --> 34:25.711
That's a bunch of crap, Kelly.
I'm in real pain here.

34:25.744 --> 34:27.245
I... why, do you have drugs
on, on...? Did you...?

34:27.279 --> 34:28.280
Everything's on the ship.

34:31.984 --> 34:34.319
Approaching ionosphere,
adjusting attitude.

34:39.825 --> 34:41.627
Mercer to Bortus.

34:41.660 --> 34:43.128
Are you gonna be able
to cut the deflectors

34:43.161 --> 34:44.296
long enough for us
to get through?

34:44.329 --> 34:45.798
BORTUS:
It may not matter, sir.

34:45.831 --> 34:47.332
The deflectors are almost gone.

34:48.634 --> 34:50.268
Oh, boy, that can't be good.

34:50.302 --> 34:51.637
They won't fire on us, they
know we have the device.

34:53.672 --> 34:56.975
Give me the device.

35:06.785 --> 35:08.186
Give me the device,

35:08.220 --> 35:11.624
and perhaps I will not harm you.

35:13.626 --> 35:15.694
(quietly):
All right, he's got a gun.

35:15.728 --> 35:17.362
But we have something better.

35:17.395 --> 35:18.531
What?

35:18.564 --> 35:19.865
Seat belts.

35:21.133 --> 35:22.334
(shouts)

35:28.306 --> 35:31.076
Deflectors are depleted.

35:44.256 --> 35:46.725
That was a piece
of the upper engine!

35:46.759 --> 35:48.360
We've lost helm control!

35:48.393 --> 35:50.395
Mercer to Orville,
we've lost navigational control

35:50.428 --> 35:52.565
and we're about 12 seconds
away from hitting you

35:52.598 --> 35:54.700
like a bug on a windshield.
Lieutenant,

35:54.733 --> 35:57.235
can you align the shuttle bay
doors with their trajectory?

35:57.269 --> 35:59.572
Sir, even if I was
the best helmsman in the galaxy,

35:59.605 --> 36:01.406
that's virtually impossible.

36:01.439 --> 36:04.142
If you can hug the donkey,

36:04.176 --> 36:05.944
you can do this.

36:08.113 --> 36:09.447
Come on, man, you got this.

36:10.448 --> 36:11.449
You can do it.

36:13.552 --> 36:16.388
It's like threading a needle
in a hurricane, but I'll try.

36:33.606 --> 36:35.173
(laughter, cheering)

36:35.207 --> 36:36.575
Yes. (whoops) (exhales sharply)

36:36.609 --> 36:37.610
Well done, Lieutenant.

36:37.643 --> 36:38.911
Sir, since I pulled that off,

36:38.944 --> 36:40.412
can I please wear
shorts to work?

36:40.445 --> 36:43.081
I've already said no.
Return fire.

36:50.789 --> 36:53.458
Secure that Krill!

36:53.491 --> 36:55.193
KRILL COMMANDER:
Union vessel, surrender

36:55.227 --> 36:56.962
and prepare to be boarded.

36:59.998 --> 37:02.234
Upper and middle engines
are gone, Captain.

37:02.267 --> 37:04.536
I have failed you.
Ship's in one piece, Bortus.

37:04.569 --> 37:06.304
I couldn't have done better.
Isaac.

37:06.338 --> 37:07.873
If I can buy
us some time,

37:07.906 --> 37:08.874
can you restore enough power
to the lower engine

37:08.907 --> 37:09.942
to get us out of here?

37:09.975 --> 37:11.443
I can try, sir.
Do it.

37:11.476 --> 37:14.279
Alara, hail the commander
of the Krill ship.

37:14.312 --> 37:15.580
Captain,
he's already signaling us.

37:15.614 --> 37:16.581
Put him on.

37:16.615 --> 37:17.716
Krill Commander,

37:17.750 --> 37:19.251
this is Captain Ed Mercer.

37:19.284 --> 37:21.319
Break off your attack,
and we can talk.

37:21.353 --> 37:24.156
Give me the device, human,

37:24.189 --> 37:27.159
or I will destroy your ship.

37:27.192 --> 37:28.894
Sorry, can you,
can you move, like,

37:28.927 --> 37:31.296
two steps to your right?
What?

37:31.329 --> 37:32.464
Just like a little,
t-tiny bit...

37:32.497 --> 37:34.599
It's just a lot of dead
space there, just...

37:34.633 --> 37:36.401
Yeah, just right th--
perfect. Yeah, sorry,

37:36.434 --> 37:37.670
you were just very
weirdly framed,

37:37.703 --> 37:38.904
it was all I
could focus on.

37:38.937 --> 37:40.272
Anyway, what is it you want?

37:40.305 --> 37:42.641
You know what I want.

37:42.675 --> 37:44.677
Sorry, right, yeah, sorry.
I'm a little distracted lately.

37:44.710 --> 37:46.278
I just got out
of a rough marriage,

37:46.311 --> 37:47.813
and it's been
a difficult time.

37:47.846 --> 37:48.981
My wife had an affair...
Oh, my God.

37:49.014 --> 37:50.649
Are you really bringing
this up right now?

37:50.683 --> 37:53.418
I'm trying to keep him talking,
so I can buy us some time.

37:53.451 --> 37:54.653
Oh, okay. In that case,
you know what?

37:54.687 --> 37:55.821
You're an objective third party.

37:55.854 --> 37:56.922
Are you married?

37:56.955 --> 37:58.156
What?

37:58.190 --> 37:59.257
Oh, my God, you're ac--

37:59.291 --> 38:00.659
you're bringing him into our...

38:00.693 --> 38:01.760
No, I'm just buying
us some time.

38:01.794 --> 38:02.928
Let me ask
you something.

38:02.961 --> 38:04.029
Do you make an effort to balance

38:04.062 --> 38:05.363
your career with your home life?

38:05.397 --> 38:07.432
A marriage is work.

38:07.465 --> 38:09.601
It takes work, right?
Compromise.

38:09.634 --> 38:10.969
On both sides, yes.

38:11.003 --> 38:12.204
And if you didn't
make that effort,

38:12.237 --> 38:13.772
would you be surprised
if your wife

38:13.806 --> 38:15.473
sought comfort in
the arms of another?

38:15.507 --> 38:17.209
No, that would be selfish.

38:17.242 --> 38:18.543
"No, that would be s..."
Yeah, yeah,

38:18.576 --> 38:19.978
'cause both of you
are complete friggin' saints.

38:20.012 --> 38:21.880
You know what? I don't have
to sit here and listen...

38:21.914 --> 38:23.648
(explosion)
KRILL COMMANDER: Enough!

38:23.682 --> 38:25.784
Emergency power.

38:25.818 --> 38:28.120
You have 20 seconds
to give me the device,

38:28.153 --> 38:30.388
or you will die.

38:30.422 --> 38:31.890
Isaac, what about that engine?

38:31.924 --> 38:33.792
Still only at partial power,
sir.

38:33.826 --> 38:36.061
Alara, put the Krill on hold.

38:37.162 --> 38:38.630
I have an idea.

38:38.663 --> 38:39.732
What is it?

38:39.765 --> 38:41.233
Let's give him the device.

38:41.266 --> 38:42.968
What?
Dr. Aronov,

38:43.001 --> 38:44.402
can you preset the
field to fire up

38:44.436 --> 38:45.537
at a specific
intensity the moment

38:45.570 --> 38:46.571
the Krill activate it?

38:46.604 --> 38:48.206
I think so, but why?

38:48.240 --> 38:49.842
And the field can accelerate
time a hundred years.

38:49.875 --> 38:51.243
Correct?
Yes, it can.

38:51.276 --> 38:53.578
About how long it takes
a redwood to grow.

39:04.456 --> 39:06.291
Alara, put him back on.

39:07.793 --> 39:10.395
All right, Commander, you win.

39:10.428 --> 39:11.764
We'll send you the device
by remote shuttle.

39:11.797 --> 39:13.198
When you receive it,

39:13.231 --> 39:15.000
we'll transmit
the activation code.

39:15.033 --> 39:17.035
Do not take long.

39:17.069 --> 39:18.771
We won't.

39:20.072 --> 39:21.774
Maybe she's not such a bitch.

39:23.876 --> 39:26.845
State-of-the-art weaponry on
this ship and we're using glue.

39:26.879 --> 39:28.246
My favorite part
of being a fleet officer.

39:28.280 --> 39:30.215
The arts and crafts.

39:30.248 --> 39:31.416
You know, if we had time,

39:31.449 --> 39:33.118
I'd make a macaroni
man to put on here.

39:33.151 --> 39:34.286
You can make a macaroni man?

39:34.319 --> 39:36.454
I make really good macaroni men.

39:37.823 --> 39:39.825
All right, let's get
her out of here.

39:56.474 --> 39:58.911
The shuttle is aboard
the Krill ship.

39:58.944 --> 39:59.912
Signal them.

40:01.113 --> 40:02.881
All right, Commander.
You have it.

40:02.915 --> 40:03.982
Excellent. Now,

40:04.016 --> 40:07.285
give me the activation code.

40:09.654 --> 40:12.825
The code is six, alpha, nine,
three, seven,

40:12.858 --> 40:15.427
alpha, three, zero, zero.

40:15.460 --> 40:17.262
(beeping)

40:18.696 --> 40:20.465
Happy Arbor Day.

40:40.318 --> 40:42.320
Wait. What's Arbor Day?

40:42.354 --> 40:44.322
It's the holiday
where you plant the trees.

40:44.356 --> 40:46.491
I wouldn't have got that. Oh, yeah.
No, I didn't get that, either.

40:46.524 --> 40:47.926
You knew what Arbor Day was,
right?

40:47.960 --> 40:49.327
I mean, actually, I
had to think a second.

40:49.361 --> 40:50.462
Kind of confusing.

40:50.495 --> 40:51.763
Nobody knows what Arbor Day is.

40:51.796 --> 40:52.965
BORTUS: No.
ALARA: No.

40:52.998 --> 40:54.199
I knew. BORTUS: I do not.

40:54.232 --> 40:55.200
What would you have said?

40:55.233 --> 40:56.268
I would've said,

40:56.301 --> 40:57.836
"You got wood."

40:57.870 --> 40:59.771
(laughter) GORDON: Yeah.

40:59.804 --> 41:00.939
Yes.

41:00.973 --> 41:03.175
Yeah, that is better,
isn't it?

41:12.717 --> 41:14.119
(door chimes)

41:14.152 --> 41:15.487
Come in.

41:17.255 --> 41:18.857
Hi.

41:18.891 --> 41:20.392
Hi.

41:20.425 --> 41:21.994
I didn't want to bother you
unless I had to.

41:22.027 --> 41:24.662
You've kind of kept to yourself
these last few days.

41:24.696 --> 41:26.899
Yeah, the admirals want a full
report on the Epsilon 2 stuff,

41:26.932 --> 41:28.666
so it's just taking a while.

41:28.700 --> 41:30.002
Yeah, you need some help?

41:30.035 --> 41:31.169
No, I got it.

41:31.203 --> 41:34.072
So, um, I just wanted
to tell you

41:34.106 --> 41:35.340
(whirring, clicking) that
Lieutenant Commander Murphy...

41:35.373 --> 41:36.408
Sorry.

41:36.441 --> 41:38.243
Excuse me.
Can you... just...

41:38.276 --> 41:39.677
Just not now.

41:39.711 --> 41:41.579
No, just... we're talking.
We're t...

41:41.613 --> 41:43.715
Yes. Good, you got it, good.

41:43.748 --> 41:45.750
Okay.

41:45.783 --> 41:46.885
Lieutenant Commander Murphy
of the USS...

41:46.919 --> 41:48.586
(whirring, clicking)
Oh, my God.

41:48.620 --> 41:50.088
Just come back l...
just do it later. Thank you.

41:50.122 --> 41:51.723
Just not now,
we're having a conversation.

41:51.756 --> 41:53.558
Thank-- yes. Thank you.
Good. Thumbs up. Okay.

41:53.591 --> 41:54.692
Sorry, go ahead.

41:54.726 --> 41:56.094
Lieutenant Commander Murphy

41:56.128 --> 41:57.896
of the USS Chanute
just got promoted.

41:57.930 --> 42:00.565
So now he's eligible for
a first officer position.

42:00.598 --> 42:02.234
And he's a friend of mine.

42:02.267 --> 42:04.569
So I told him
he could have this posting.

42:04.602 --> 42:07.772
He's a great guy,
you're gonna love him,

42:07.805 --> 42:10.075
and I'll be out of your hair
by the end of the day.

42:11.376 --> 42:13.278
Okay.

42:14.446 --> 42:16.381
Okay.

42:18.283 --> 42:19.451
Wait.

42:22.320 --> 42:26.424
I never really said thank you
for what you did.

42:27.825 --> 42:29.094
You saved the ship.

42:29.127 --> 42:31.796
I was just doing my job.

42:34.499 --> 42:38.770
You were always better at
solving my problems than I was.

42:38.803 --> 42:43.241
You were
always wise.

42:43.275 --> 42:46.911
Well...
thank you for saying that.

42:50.115 --> 42:52.350
Kelly.

42:54.286 --> 42:58.456
I'm asking you to stay.

43:00.458 --> 43:01.893
Really?

43:01.926 --> 43:04.096
You're one hell of an XO,

43:04.129 --> 43:07.932
and I think you'd make
a fine addition to this crew.

43:07.966 --> 43:11.003
A-And you're not concerned

43:11.036 --> 43:13.905
about the other stuff?

43:13.938 --> 43:15.974
We'll figure it out.

43:19.144 --> 43:20.778
Welcome to the Orville,

43:20.812 --> 43:22.814
Commander Grayson.

43:34.559 --> 43:35.760
(door chimes)

43:35.793 --> 43:36.961
Come in.

43:38.796 --> 43:40.098
Commander Grayson, have a seat.

43:40.132 --> 43:41.533
I can't stay long.

43:41.566 --> 43:44.202
I just wanted to say thank you.

43:45.470 --> 43:47.005
For trusting me.

43:47.039 --> 43:51.009
Your father and I were close.
I owed him one.

43:51.043 --> 43:54.979
Regardless, it looks like
you were right about Ed.

43:55.013 --> 43:57.982
You made a hell of a plea
for us to give him that command.

43:58.016 --> 44:00.552
Honestly, I don't think
we would've done it otherwise.

44:00.585 --> 44:02.554
I know.

44:02.587 --> 44:05.890
But he's a smart officer who
just had a little rough patch.

44:05.923 --> 44:06.891
Does he know?

44:06.924 --> 44:08.126
No.

44:08.160 --> 44:10.062
And I plan on keeping it
that way.

44:10.095 --> 44:14.066
Well... he's lucky
to have you on his side.

44:14.099 --> 44:15.867
Thank you.

44:15.900 --> 44:18.036
Take care, Admiral.
