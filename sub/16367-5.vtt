00:26.192 --> 00:27.693
Good evening.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.762
I'm Helen Mirren,
and you're watching

00:29.764 --> 00:33.799
"Documentary Now!"
Season 51.

00:33.801 --> 00:37.770
For a decade, Test Pattern
combined new wave music,

00:37.772 --> 00:40.773
performance art,
and political activism

00:40.775 --> 00:44.543
to become one of the world's
most famous rock bands.

00:44.545 --> 00:48.614
And then, suddenly, it was over.

00:48.616 --> 00:51.250
But not before one last concert,

00:51.252 --> 00:55.587
forever preserved in the film
"Final Transmission."

01:31.691 --> 01:33.092

The Connecticut Institute
of Art and Design.

05:09.043 --> 05:10.442
School of Art and Design.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.511
School of Art and Design.

05:12.513 --> 05:15.681
First year I met Lee,
he had told everyone on campus

05:15.683 --> 05:19.318
that...
he had made every piece

05:19.320 --> 05:22.020
in the Museum of Modern Art.

05:22.022 --> 05:25.023
And...
that was the work.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.793
Him telling people that was...

05:27.795 --> 05:29.328
was the piece of art.

was full of shit,
but after a while,

06:02.096 --> 06:04.129
I just, you know,
I really admired his moxie.

06:04.131 --> 06:07.733
I thought what he was trying
to do was really interesting.

06:07.735 --> 06:10.869
And you just...

06:10.871 --> 06:12.938

I don't know what
the answer is.

06:20.781 --> 06:26.518
But sometimes I think
we could've called it quits

06:26.520 --> 06:27.552
a couple of years ago.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.688
Thank you.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.824

Thank you.

I gave it to you yesterday.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.095
Thank you.

06:41.068 --> 06:45.437
Test Pattern, as a project, was
never meant to last forever.

06:45.439 --> 06:49.941
There was definitely a...
a finite end

06:49.943 --> 06:52.577
that was meant to be.

06:55.715 --> 06:56.715
Thank you.

How did you find your way
into Test Pattern?

07:53.841 --> 07:55.207
How did that start?

07:55.209 --> 07:58.777
Well, I was Marky's girlfriend.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.712
We grew up
in New Haven together,

08:00.714 --> 08:03.215
and then when he and Lee
were forming Test Pattern,

08:03.217 --> 08:05.016
they were looking for
a female vocalist,

08:05.018 --> 08:08.520
and I don't know why...

08:08.522 --> 08:11.089
they thought of me,

08:11.091 --> 08:14.626
'cause...
I had never done anything like that,

08:14.628 --> 08:19.064
so I enrolled in CSAD
the following year, and...

08:19.066 --> 08:20.532
and then Lee and I got married.

08:20.534 --> 08:22.801
Wait, Lee?
How did that happen?

08:22.803 --> 08:25.203
Well, it was part of
a performance he was doing

08:25.205 --> 08:27.038
about the banality of marriage,

08:27.040 --> 08:30.075
so he married a lot of objects.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.611
Like a telephone...
you know,

08:32.613 --> 08:35.580
parrot,
and a fancy automobile.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.048
And then I was the only human.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.834
Thank you.

09:00.039 --> 09:03.275
We're seeing the history
of the band sort of unfolding.

09:03.277 --> 09:06.545
and...
we got some more friends.

Test Pattern is an agreement,
a visual agreement,

10:51.718 --> 10:54.686
more than it is a group,
but we're still a group,

10:54.688 --> 10:57.756
I mean, we still consider
ourselves part of the...

10:57.758 --> 11:00.425
the art movement or the punk movement or...
or whatever it is.

11:00.427 --> 11:03.395
We still enjoy playing music
with each other.

11:03.397 --> 11:06.031
It's just that, at some point,

11:06.033 --> 11:09.100
you have to pull down
the curtain

11:09.102 --> 11:12.971
and put on our pajamas.

11:48.240 --> 11:52.410
Well, the group was starting
to sound really stale.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.946
It's very limiting
to have just guitars

11:54.948 --> 11:57.215
and electric bass and drums,

11:57.217 --> 12:02.087
and our producer, Ooto Keirsha,
played me this record,

12:02.089 --> 12:05.090
and it was gamelan music
from Bali,

12:05.092 --> 12:07.726
and I was really struck
by all the bells...

12:07.728 --> 12:09.327
It sounded like church bells
or something...

12:09.329 --> 12:11.429
and I went to the band
and I said,

12:11.431 --> 12:13.732
"This is what we should do,"
and they agreed

12:13.734 --> 12:15.934
and they nodded, and I said,

12:15.936 --> 12:18.870
"We're gonna incorporate
their music into our songs."

12:18.872 --> 12:20.505
Or, rather, my songs.

12:20.507 --> 12:24.776
The name of this song
is "In Ding, In Ding."

12:48.968 --> 12:52.170
I didn't love
the Balinese stuff.

12:52.172 --> 12:55.940
To be honest with you,
it wasn't my favorite.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.909
It just sounds like

12:57.911 --> 13:00.512
a dozen dumb doorbells.

13:00.514 --> 13:02.781
♪ In ding, in ding... ♪

13:09.189 --> 13:11.422
♪ In ding, in ding... ♪

13:19.165 --> 13:22.233
For you, creativity seems
to be your primary concern.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.502
Would you say that
you resent your success?

13:24.504 --> 13:26.304
I don't know
that I'm successful.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.305
I don't know that.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.340
I'm always yearning.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.176
That's just what I do...
I just keep trying

13:31.178 --> 13:32.811
to make more things and...

13:32.813 --> 13:34.512
I have no resentment because...

13:34.514 --> 13:36.414
well, I do have
some resentment.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.017
But that's a separate issue.

13:44.558 --> 13:48.159
Marky, what are you gonna do
now that the band's over?

13:48.161 --> 13:49.527
I'd like to be like
Mike J. Fox

13:49.529 --> 13:52.363
in "Bright Lights, Big City,"
and wear a suit.

13:52.365 --> 13:56.301
Blow rails.
Make some money in New York.

13:56.303 --> 14:01.105
Loosened tie...
Go out, drink during the day.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.440
- Okay, okay.
- Thank you very much.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.541
- That's done.
- Thank you.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.009
That's all done.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.414
What are you gonna do
after it's all over?

14:09.416 --> 14:11.082
Probably just keep jammin',
you know?

14:11.084 --> 14:13.084
Playing cool drums.
Partying.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.386
I got...
I have a new Camaro that I like a lot.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.388
How can you afford
a Camaro?

14:17.390 --> 14:19.591
From the band.

14:19.593 --> 14:21.359
What, did he give you
publishing on something or...

14:21.361 --> 14:22.627
- Yeah.
- He did?

14:22.629 --> 14:24.295
Oh, yeah.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.397
I can't afford a Camaro.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.000
This next song
was on one of our records,

14:29.002 --> 14:30.602
and it was written
by Marky here.

14:30.604 --> 14:31.603
Marky wrote it.

14:33.139 --> 14:34.505
No, hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

14:34.507 --> 14:37.942
The reviews said that
the singing has no melody,

14:37.944 --> 14:41.479
and not in a cool way where
it sounds like it's angular.

14:41.481 --> 14:45.149
It sounds more like he is trying
to hit notes that he cannot hit.

14:45.151 --> 14:46.517
The last time we played this
a couple years ago,

14:46.519 --> 14:48.253
many people went to
the concession stand,

14:48.255 --> 14:50.221
and, well, that just happens,

14:50.223 --> 14:51.923
but we're gonna do the song,

14:51.925 --> 14:53.291
and Marky, why don't you
introduce it?

14:57.063 --> 15:00.298
I wrote a lot of songs.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.968
And...
this was the only one we recorded.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.637
You know, at the time,
I was reading a lot of

15:05.639 --> 15:07.572

I had been watching Lee
writing stuff

16:43.370 --> 16:46.671
and I saw Marky trying
to write stuff,

16:46.673 --> 16:50.208
and I just thought, you know,
I bet I could do that.

16:50.210 --> 16:54.712
And... so I just jotted
a little something down, you know?

16:54.714 --> 16:59.017
And...
couple months later it was a hit.

16:59.019 --> 17:00.685
Some of you may know
this next...

17:00.687 --> 17:02.186
Well, all of you
know this next song.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.656
It was on a movie soundtrack.

17:05.657 --> 17:08.459

very famous movie.

17:08.461 --> 17:09.627

18:19.399 --> 18:21.866
Well, "Save Time for Me"
is the biggest hit,

18:21.868 --> 18:24.735
but I don't consider it to be
part of the Test Pattern canon,

18:24.737 --> 18:25.736
so to speak.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.805
It's just a song

18:27.807 --> 18:30.508
that I play guitar on.

18:30.510 --> 18:36.180
And it's not us as a band.
It's really more Anita's song.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.577
I think the problem
is and was

19:06.579 --> 19:09.280
that it became more of
a money-making endeavor.

19:09.282 --> 19:12.583
Certain band members found that
it was more important for them

19:12.585 --> 19:18.189
to buy things like houses
and cars and tennis rackets...

19:19.559 --> 19:21.926
Instead of really being
more cohesive

19:21.928 --> 19:26.764
and to continue
exploring music and sound.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.368
Well...

19:31.838 --> 19:34.772
I was panhandling over by
the old train tracks,

19:34.774 --> 19:38.609
and Buster told me
to move it along.

19:41.614 --> 19:44.649
So I shuffled down to the
five-and-dime on Lincoln Street

19:44.651 --> 19:49.954
and bought myself a pair
of used roller skates

19:49.956 --> 19:53.958
in all faded yellow and green.

20:01.967 --> 20:05.736
But then, Rosalita, well...

20:05.738 --> 20:07.471
Or as Rosa,
as I like to call her...

20:07.473 --> 20:11.375
On Tuesdays.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.377
She said she wanted
a pair of roller skates,

20:13.379 --> 20:15.813
so I gave 'em to her.

20:18.284 --> 20:20.751

22:30.483 --> 22:31.982
I feel like
we're just hitting our stride

22:31.984 --> 22:33.751
and I-I-I'd love
to keep playing.

22:33.753 --> 22:36.420
You know, we're just starting
to make some real money.

22:36.422 --> 22:39.557
But, you know, Lee says...
You know,

22:39.559 --> 22:41.125
artists don't look
in the rear-view mirror

22:41.127 --> 22:45.363
and they move forward
and break up bands, I guess.

22:46.966 --> 22:51.969
So this song here is...
kind of the last song we wrote.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.871
