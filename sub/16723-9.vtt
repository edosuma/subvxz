WEBVTT

00:20.854 --> 00:23.106
There he is.
Little King Trashmouth.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.190
Oh, what's he eating?

00:24.274 --> 00:26.276
A coffee filter filled with taco meat?

00:26.359 --> 00:27.819
No carbs for him, huh?

00:27.902 --> 00:29.279
Uh-oh.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.406
Oh, it's the one I call El Diablo!

00:31.489 --> 00:32.449
Like the Devil, yeah.

00:32.532 --> 00:35.160
One of these days, there's gonna
be a rumble between those two.

00:35.243 --> 00:36.745
- Lin...
- I'm on the phone!

00:36.828 --> 00:38.204
Ginger, I wish you could see.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.040
The big one's all mangy and crazy-eyed.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.000
He looks like your cousin Cheryl.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.501
Aw, poor Cheryl.

00:43.585 --> 00:44.753
How's her psoriasis?

00:44.836 --> 00:45.962
Oh, my God. Lin.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.964
Oh, she used to leave a trail
of those flakes.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.466
Lin, we're kind of trying to eat.

00:49.549 --> 00:52.218
Okay, Ginger.
Yeah, I'll talk to you later. Bye.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.345
Lot of raccoon talk.

00:53.428 --> 00:54.679
Oh, shush, she asked.

00:54.763 --> 00:55.680
She loves that stuff.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.640
Ginger could've listened to me forever,

00:57.724 --> 00:59.893
but she had to take her daughter
to a slumber party.

00:59.976 --> 01:01.061
Slumber party, huh?

01:01.144 --> 01:03.063
My condolences to Ginger's daughter.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.981
What's wrong with slumber parties?

01:05.065 --> 01:07.776
Yeah, and while we're at it,
what's wrong with diarrhea, huh?

01:07.859 --> 01:09.694
Slumber parties are the cat's pajamas.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.529
Especially when I wear my cat pajamas.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.615
Wait. How many slumber parties
have you been to?

01:13.698 --> 01:14.532
One and a half.

01:14.616 --> 01:17.160
I fell asleep at a regular birthday party.
I'm counting that.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.828
You know, if you wanted to,

01:18.912 --> 01:20.830
you could have a slumber party here,
Louise.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.791
You can invite girls from your class.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.002
Have you met the girls from my class, Mom?

01:26.086 --> 01:29.339
Here's what is going through their heads
every moment of the day:

01:29.422 --> 01:30.757
Stickers, stickers,

01:30.840 --> 01:32.634
stickers, stickers, stickers,

01:32.717 --> 01:34.260
stickers, stickers, stickers!

01:34.344 --> 01:35.470
What kind of stickers?

01:35.553 --> 01:36.596
I love stickers.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.139
Anyway...

01:38.223 --> 01:40.558
But, honey, you need a BFF like Ginger.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.519
They're not easy to find.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.854
Gotta slumber through a lot of parties
to meet her.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.732
She's right, I had plenty of false starts
before I met Ken.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.609
-Who's Ken?
-His adult albino friend

01:49.693 --> 01:50.985
who does improvised hip-hop.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.446
-Yep. But Ken's also not real.
-Mm-hm. Hey!

01:53.530 --> 01:56.282
I had an imaginary friend.
She used to steal from me.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.784
All my makeup, my lipsticks.

01:57.867 --> 02:00.245
Well, thanks for the life advice,
everybody.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.205
Food for thought, oh, yum.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.124
Full of it, lots of thoughts.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.377
I'm worried about Louise.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.170
What little girl doesn't want a party?

02:09.254 --> 02:12.048
Are you really surprised?
She's not the most social kid.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.009
She still hasn't accepted
my friend request,

02:14.092 --> 02:15.218
and I know she's seen it.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.678
Ugh. Drives me nuts.

02:16.761 --> 02:19.389
If Louise would do the things
she hates, I know she'd love it.

02:19.472 --> 02:23.226
-That sounds like nonsense.
-Nonsense or mom-sense?

02:23.309 --> 02:26.980
I think you might be making too big a deal
about this slumber party thing, Lin.

02:27.063 --> 02:29.482
It is a big deal.
It's a part of growing up.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.693
Like getting braces
or throwing rocks at cars.

02:31.776 --> 02:34.154
-You used to throw rocks at cars?
-Yeah.

02:34.237 --> 02:37.824
Cars wouldn't even come down my street
because they knew Linda would get them.

02:39.325 --> 02:43.329
Okay, somebody give me a hand
with the coffee table, we gotta move it.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.790
Finally, we're giving this dump
a makeover.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.251
I've been carrying these swatches
around for years!

02:48.335 --> 02:50.086
No, guess again.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.755
Wait, what's going on, Lin?

02:51.838 --> 02:54.799
Oh, who could that be?

02:54.883 --> 02:56.092
Maybe it's for you, Louise.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.427
-You better check.
-Sure.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.179
Strange visitors at a weird hour?

02:59.262 --> 03:01.181
-Send your kid to the door!
-Go.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.892
I hope it's Matt Damon.
I wrote him over a year ago.

03:04.934 --> 03:08.438
Hi, Louise. Slumber party!

03:08.521 --> 03:11.358
-No. No, no, no!
-Ta-da!

03:11.441 --> 03:14.402
Louise, you're having your very own
surprise slumber party.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.029
No!

03:16.112 --> 03:17.697
Bunch up, bunch up. Go.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.032
Don't let her through.

03:19.115 --> 03:19.991
Get her, get her.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.202
Best friends forever!

03:22.285 --> 03:23.536
Get the door.

03:25.622 --> 03:28.833
Slumber party fashion show, all right!

03:28.917 --> 03:29.918
All right!

03:30.001 --> 03:31.920
Slumber party fashion show!

03:32.003 --> 03:33.588
Come on, jump in any time, sweetie.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.508
Okay, she's still warming up.
Here we go.

03:36.591 --> 03:40.220
This is happening? Seriously, Dad.
Dad, is this real?

03:40.303 --> 03:42.722
-I think it could be fun.
-Oh, yeah.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.474
I'm gonna go finish something that's--

03:44.557 --> 03:46.142
I'll do it for you and you just...

03:46.226 --> 03:47.602
-No, you stay.
-Enjoy the show.

03:47.686 --> 03:49.104
-Gotta go, have fun.
-Louise.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.188
-No, please.
-Come on.

03:50.271 --> 03:52.524
Look at Harley in a classic
pink feather boa

03:52.607 --> 03:53.942
and one of my old nightshirts!

03:54.025 --> 03:55.860
-Okay, next model. Go!
-I'll go!

03:55.944 --> 03:58.196
Gene, you just went.
Give someone else a turn.

03:58.446 --> 04:02.534
-I'll go.
-Ooh, rain poncho and sunglasses.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.119
Forecast calls for fabulous!

04:04.202 --> 04:05.995
That's it. I'm out. Thank you!

04:06.079 --> 04:07.080
Oh, no, you're not!

04:07.163 --> 04:09.124
Stop it. You're being very rude
to your guests.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.459
Am I, Mom? Because let me tell you
about my "guests."

04:11.543 --> 04:12.919
-Fashion show.
-That's Harley.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.379
Look at this fluffy boa snake.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.047
I'm glad it's not a real snake.

04:16.131 --> 04:18.091
Could you imag? It's fake, it's a boa.

04:18.174 --> 04:20.969
As in "Harley ever shuts her mouth."

04:21.052 --> 04:22.971
What are your 10 favorite colors
of dogs?

04:23.054 --> 04:25.557
Mine are red, brown spots,
black, white, orange spots,

04:25.640 --> 04:29.060
kind of brown, kind of black, brown spots,
black spots, red spots, red stripes.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.145
And Jodi over there?

04:30.228 --> 04:33.273
She's so afraid of germs,
she's never sat on a toilet seat.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.691
Or any seat!

04:38.111 --> 04:41.489
And then there's Abby. She likes to braid.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.576
Stop it! Stop braiding my mops, Abby!

04:44.659 --> 04:46.411
But they look so pretty.

04:46.494 --> 04:50.081
And finally, Jessica.
Bland, boring Jessica.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.542
If she was a spice, she'd be flour.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.753
If she were a book, she'd be two books.

04:54.836 --> 04:55.837
Yeah, she is boring.

04:55.920 --> 04:56.755
You know what?

04:56.838 --> 04:59.632
By the end of the night,
you're all gonna be good buddies.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.510
-Uh-huh. She's Abby! She's got heels on!
-Ow! Ow! My ankles!

05:02.594 --> 05:03.428
Lawsuit!

05:03.511 --> 05:06.639
Okay, okay, you're okay.
Come here, honey. Get up. Come on.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.434
There she is. She's dancing.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.936
Uh, excuse me. Mrs. Belcher,
I'm ready for bed.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.688
What? You're pooping out already?

05:13.772 --> 05:16.232
-It's 8:15, Jessica. What're you...?
-Huh? See?

05:16.316 --> 05:17.359
That's my bedtime.

05:17.442 --> 05:20.070
-What are your parents, farmers?
-No. Osteopaths.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.529
Osteopath? What's that?

05:21.613 --> 05:23.782
It's the study of the body...

05:23.865 --> 05:25.200
Okay, that's nice.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.327
Okay. Tina, put her in your room.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.370
-Good night.
-Okay.

05:28.453 --> 05:31.039
Well, guess I'm gonna turn in, too.

05:31.122 --> 05:33.833
No! You're staying right here, young lady.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.251
And you'll be glad you did

05:35.335 --> 05:37.462
when you hear what
we're doing next: tie-dye!

05:37.545 --> 05:38.797
-Yeah!
-No!

05:38.880 --> 05:40.215
-Yes!
-No!

05:40.298 --> 05:41.132
Yes!

05:41.216 --> 05:44.219
That's an even worse form of dying
than actual dying!

05:44.302 --> 05:46.513
I would take actual dying right now.

05:46.596 --> 05:47.806
Oh, so dramatic.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.642
No! My hand! Ow!

05:50.809 --> 05:53.061
Okay, great. Tying and dying.

05:54.229 --> 05:57.482
All right, Little King Trashmouth
found himself a piece of pizza.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.275
Aw, wish he could come to the party.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.527
He could take my place.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.778
Aw, that's sweet, but no.

06:01.861 --> 06:02.779
Give me a shirt!

06:02.862 --> 06:05.699
I'm gonna make the psychedelic
crop top of my dreams!

06:05.782 --> 06:08.743
I only got enough shirts
for Louise and the girls, honey.

06:08.827 --> 06:12.080
Hey, here's something you can do,
you be the pesky brother!

06:12.163 --> 06:14.624
You're running around,
pulling the little girls' pigtails.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.751
-On it!
-Don't you dare.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.170
-Ow!
-Sorry!

06:19.254 --> 06:21.881
I don't even want to do this. It's my job.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.591
I'm making it fun.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.593
How about me, Mom? What's my angle?

06:25.677 --> 06:28.930
Well, Tina, you're the older sister.
You're over all this stuff.

06:29.014 --> 06:32.267
You want to go to the mall with friends
and beep each other on your beepers.

06:32.350 --> 06:33.393
-Beep-beep!
-Cool.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.603
A sarcastic mall rat. As if.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.355
That's it. You're getting it.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.816
Okay. You're okay.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.986
No one knows. You'll deal with it
in the morning. Go to sleep.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.447
All right! Harley, what you got?

06:45.530 --> 06:49.659
I made an orange and yellow tie-dye,
because my cat is orange and yellow.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.620
And my cat's name is Popover.
What's your cat's name?

06:52.704 --> 06:53.538
My cat's name is

06:53.621 --> 06:56.916
I Don't Have A Cat Stop Talking
To Me Right Now, Harley!

06:57.000 --> 06:58.710
Aw, so cute. Where is it?

06:58.793 --> 07:00.712
Okay, now you girls just sit tight.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.964
I'm gonna get these shirts
out of your way.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.508
Louise, stop it! Stay. Okay.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.344
Ah, better check on Jessica.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.471
Jessica? You asleep?

07:09.679 --> 07:11.514
Aw, look at her. Snoozing away.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.308
Sweet little, boring little lump.

07:13.933 --> 07:17.687
Whoops, oh, my tie-dyes.
Gotta get these to the tub.

07:20.106 --> 07:23.193
I'm just gonna make like a tree
and go to my room.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.653
-Can I braid your hair now? Say yes!
-Ugh.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.615
If you have stickers I'll trade you,
but my stickers are really rare

07:28.698 --> 07:30.533
so one of mine equals six of yours.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.410
-Ugh.
-I need antibacterial soap

07:32.494 --> 07:34.621
and your mom only
has seashell-shaped soap.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.874
-These are rare.
-Let me braid your hair.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.709
I could do it across the top.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.962
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

07:43.046 --> 07:47.926
It is time to turn this slumber party
into a going-away party.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.469
Going-away party? That's awesome!

07:49.552 --> 07:51.304
Yeah, it's really gonna be fun.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.014
Why are you pinching my arm?

07:53.098 --> 07:56.101
Bob, are you at a good stopping place?
Can I come in...

07:56.184 --> 07:57.644
-Oh, whew.
-I know.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.939
Whew, don't tell the little squeamish one
you did that so close to her shirt.

08:01.022 --> 08:03.441
I won't bring it up, but if she asks,
I'm not gonna lie.

08:03.525 --> 08:04.943
Next activity!

08:06.778 --> 08:10.115
Make your cupcakes pretty, everybody!
And then we're gonna eat them up!

08:10.198 --> 08:12.492
Could we turn our heads to the side

08:12.575 --> 08:14.536
so we don't breathe
on each other's cupcakes?

08:14.619 --> 08:16.746
Uh, sure. Whatever you need, Jodi.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.249
Everyone, turn your heads to the side.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.126
Ooh, okay, this is fun.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.503
We can't see what
we're doing so well, right?

08:23.586 --> 08:25.005
Oh, mystery cupcakes!

08:25.088 --> 08:27.382
-Germaphobe, huh?
-Germs are all around us.

08:27.465 --> 08:30.218
They're in our scalp, in our eyebrows,
in our mucus membranes.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.178
Someday, a cleansing rain will come.

08:32.262 --> 08:34.764
That's what I keep telling myself.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.267
Oh, yeah, I'm looking forward
to that day, Jodi.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.518
-I really am.
-Yeah.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.270
So, what are you doing here?

08:40.353 --> 08:42.689
I mean, gosh, didn't they tell you, Jodi?

08:42.772 --> 08:45.442
-Tell me what?
-About my mom's infection.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.610
She's got sewer palm.

08:47.694 --> 08:48.737
And strep thumb.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.281
Luckily, her whooping butt
is in remission.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.324
♪ Oh, la, la, la ♪

08:53.408 --> 08:54.909
I love sprinkles!

08:54.993 --> 08:57.162
Just let them sprinkle
through your fingers.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.081
No! Germs! Germs! Everywhere!

09:00.165 --> 09:01.958
Unclean! Unclean!

09:02.042 --> 09:04.169
Jodi, Jodi, stop it! Jodi.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.129
- Calm down.
- Don't touch me!

09:06.212 --> 09:07.672
-Okay, I'm sorry.
-Sewer palm!

09:07.756 --> 09:09.758
-Sewer palm!
-Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

09:09.841 --> 09:12.177
Bobby! Mr. Belcher's taking you home.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.429
-Get her out.
-Really? Okay.

09:14.512 --> 09:15.972
Let's go, Jodi.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.349
Oh, God. All right.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.017
One down.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.770
Just because Jodi had a freak-out
doesn't mean the party's over.

09:21.853 --> 09:23.229
Who wants to watch a movie?

09:23.313 --> 09:24.606
-Me!
-I do!

09:24.689 --> 09:27.567
It's called Twincinnati,
two twins who live in Cincinnati.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.611
They're gonna eat chili on spaghetti!

09:29.694 --> 09:30.945
Sounds twin-teresting.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.947
Saddle up for round two.

09:33.031 --> 09:35.283
I know what everyone's thinking.
A girl went home.

09:35.367 --> 09:38.161
Wouldn't it be perfect if Tina
took her place in the slumber party?

09:38.244 --> 09:39.746
Pfft. Thanks, but no thanks.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.623
Tina, you can watch the movie if you want.

09:41.706 --> 09:42.540
Oh, good.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.171
-So, how's school this year?
-It's okay.

09:48.797 --> 09:49.756
The classes good?

09:49.839 --> 09:51.925
I have trouble with math.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.760
Yeah, I never liked math.

09:54.386 --> 09:57.472
-Um...
-And I'm trying out for field hockey.

09:57.555 --> 09:58.390
Say again.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.100
Trying out for field hockey.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.769
-I can't make out what you're saying.
-It's okay.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.105
That's the same actress
playing both twins.

10:05.188 --> 10:06.272
They do it with a mirror.

10:06.356 --> 10:09.109
It's controversial because it takes
jobs away from other actresses

10:09.192 --> 10:10.985
-who look like that actress.
-Stop talking!

10:11.069 --> 10:12.696
You're ruining the shopping montage!

10:12.779 --> 10:14.280
Sorry about my brother.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.616
He gets a little sensitive
when twins come up.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.160
-Oh, why?
-Gene has a twin. George.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.204
-He lives in the basement.
-In the basement?

10:21.287 --> 10:22.706
You'll probably see George later.

10:22.789 --> 10:23.873
Mom lets him out at night

10:23.957 --> 10:26.459
so he can air out his hump, and his stump.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.712
Uh, I don't know if I want to meet him.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.547
Oh, of course you do!

10:30.630 --> 10:33.299
But when he's up here, just don't blink.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.593
-Huh?
-If you blink, he goes crazy.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.721
-Also, he speaks in farts.
-What?

10:37.804 --> 10:40.390
Even if you think farts are funny,
because they are,

10:40.473 --> 10:42.308
-just please do not laugh.
-Okay.

10:42.392 --> 10:43.852
-Because I laughed once...
-Yeah?

10:43.935 --> 10:45.937
and he bit off a piece of my butt.

10:46.021 --> 10:48.189
-What?
-That's why I'm sitting like this.

10:48.273 --> 10:50.442
Because I don't have
two butt cheeks to sit on.

10:50.525 --> 10:52.736
Is that why you dance weird
in dance class?

10:53.278 --> 10:54.612
Shut up, Harley.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.198
What's that noise?

10:57.282 --> 10:58.366
Oh, no.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.493
What are you up to, El Diablo?

11:00.577 --> 11:01.828
You get away from there.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.747
Oh, my God, the king's under attack.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.206
It's a rac-coup d'etat!

11:05.290 --> 11:07.625
Hey, you girls still having fun, right?

11:07.709 --> 11:09.836
I'll be right back. Got to go deal
with something.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.589
It's not a wild animal,
so everyone's okay.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.050
Mom's probably going down
to turn George loose.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.885
No, I don't want to meet George!

11:16.968 --> 11:19.596
Don't look him in the eye,
and you don't blink and don't laugh.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.514
But I don't want to have my bum bit.

11:21.598 --> 11:24.601
You just blinked. You need to practice
not blinking.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.227
-I'm sorry.
-What's going on in here?

11:26.311 --> 11:28.355
I want to go home. Take me home!

11:28.438 --> 11:30.899
Wait? Why? Okay, are you sure?

11:30.982 --> 11:33.485
I just got back
from taking Jodi home, so...

11:33.568 --> 11:34.569
I'm sure, I'm sure!

11:34.652 --> 11:36.488
Well, she seems pretty sure, Dad.

11:36.571 --> 11:39.074
Does anyone else want to go home?
Tell me now.

11:39.157 --> 11:41.826
-Are you gonna let me braid your hair?
-Not a chance.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.079
-I'll come, too.
-And we're done.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.997
Okay, if anyone needs me
for anything,

11:46.081 --> 11:48.667
I'll be in my room forgetting
tonight ever happened.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.418
Goodbye forever!

11:50.502 --> 11:53.296
Thank you, family! It was a nice try!

11:53.380 --> 11:55.131
What about the girl
who went to bed early?

11:55.215 --> 11:57.258
Right. Jessica.

11:58.176 --> 12:00.804
All right, Snorey Feldman,
up and at them!

12:02.722 --> 12:04.307
Huh? A walkie-talkie?

12:04.391 --> 12:06.976
- Hello? Jessica?
- Yup. What's up?

12:07.060 --> 12:08.978
Okay, I'll say it walkie-talkie style.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.731
The slumber party is over and out!

12:11.815 --> 12:14.150
Oh, no, I'm not leaving.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.318
Excuse me?

12:15.402 --> 12:17.737
Yeah, you're not getting rid of me
like the other girls.

12:17.821 --> 12:19.823
Uh, 10-40. Love you, kisses.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.158
What? No! No kisses! Jessica!

12:22.242 --> 12:24.327
Oh, it is on like flan.

12:24.411 --> 12:27.205
Do you eat flan, Jessica?
Because I've never had it!

12:27.288 --> 12:29.332
Louise? Am I taking Jessica home?

12:29.416 --> 12:30.792
Take the others home, Dad.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.128
I think Jessica wants to stay
and play awhile.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.338
That means I'll still need
to take her home later?

12:35.422 --> 12:38.633
- Oh, yes, Father. Oh, yes.
- Great.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.471
Okay, Jessica, what's your problem?

12:43.555 --> 12:45.557
Why the drama with the walkie-talkie?

12:45.640 --> 12:47.267
- Where is it?
- Where is what?

12:47.350 --> 12:49.185
You know what.
I know you're messing with me

12:49.269 --> 12:51.271
because that's what you did
with everybody else.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.148
I would love to mess with you, Jessica.

12:53.231 --> 12:55.900
Unfortunately, I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:55.984 --> 12:57.986
You seriously don't know
what I'm talking about?

12:58.069 --> 13:00.030
No, but now I kind of want to know.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.407
Well, I can't leave until I find
what I'm looking for.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.994
So let's just play it cool
and respect each other's situations.

13:06.077 --> 13:08.580
Okay, I'll respect your situation.

13:08.663 --> 13:11.875
Right here in the closet!

13:12.959 --> 13:13.918
Wait a second.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.879
These walkie-talkies were in my bedroom.

13:15.962 --> 13:18.089
Oh, yeah, your bedroom.
It's nice in there.

13:18.173 --> 13:19.924
You picked my lock?

13:20.008 --> 13:21.718
It practically picked itself.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.429
You pick yourself! You pick your nose!

13:24.512 --> 13:25.347
You pick your butt!

13:25.430 --> 13:27.807
You pick your nose because you think
your face is a butt!

13:27.891 --> 13:29.142
And you should think that!

13:30.685 --> 13:32.687
Gene, Tina, where is everybody?

13:32.771 --> 13:34.105
Bob, I need you in the bedroom.

13:34.189 --> 13:37.067
-What's wrong with your hair?
-What's right with it. Abby braided it.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.277
Kids, how's the party?
Is everyone having fun?

13:39.361 --> 13:42.072
They're about to get to the part
where the mayor renames the city

13:42.155 --> 13:42.989
"Twincinnati."

13:43.073 --> 13:44.199
The plot's got some holes.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.284
But also a whole lot of heart.

13:46.368 --> 13:48.495
All right! Keep slumber partying!

13:48.578 --> 13:50.246
-Good pun, Tina.
-Thank you.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.248
-Shut the door!
-Ow. What's going on?

13:52.332 --> 13:54.084
Ginger, I know, I'm about to tell him.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.169
Yeah, no, he's got his hair braided.

13:56.252 --> 13:57.962
-Pretty good, it looks pretty good.
-Lin!

13:58.046 --> 14:00.048
I gotta go. Bobby, stay calm.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.634
We are harboring a royal fugitive.

14:02.717 --> 14:03.551
What?

14:06.137 --> 14:08.098
Oh, my God, Lin! There's a raccoon!

14:08.181 --> 14:09.474
It's Little King Trashmouth.

14:09.557 --> 14:10.850
He's chewing on my good sock.

14:10.934 --> 14:14.062
Yeah. He found it under there
and he rubbed his scent glands on it

14:14.145 --> 14:15.855
and now it's his baby. Aw.

14:15.939 --> 14:17.691
Lin, why is he here?

14:17.774 --> 14:19.526
Because El Diablo attacked him tonight.

14:19.609 --> 14:22.278
So I lured him in with some cold cuts.
He needs our help.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.822
Okay, this is nuts, Lin!

14:23.905 --> 14:25.323
Oh, he sounds anxious.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.283
-Get him some wine.
-"Get him some wine"?

14:27.367 --> 14:29.494
He likes red. A little too much.

14:30.078 --> 14:33.206
Listen, we have an intruder
on the loose in this apartment.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.167
Wait, is the intruder Jessica?

14:36.251 --> 14:37.585
Yeah.

14:37.669 --> 14:41.047
Here's what we know, by day,
Jessica is red-headed wallpaper.

14:41.131 --> 14:44.259
By night, apparently she's a master
of sneaking around our house

14:44.342 --> 14:45.927
and looking for God knows what.

14:46.011 --> 14:48.013
I say we help her find
her purpose in life.

14:48.096 --> 14:50.974
-A brand consultant!
-Huh, I can see that.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.726
No, hitting the bricks!

14:52.809 --> 14:55.186
Lin, I don't want a raccoon in our room.

14:55.270 --> 14:58.189
I know. I mean, I don't agree,
but I understand.

14:58.273 --> 15:00.483
More importantly, we need
to take care of this fast

15:00.567 --> 15:02.527
so I can get this slumber party
back on track.

15:02.610 --> 15:05.405
There is no slumber party,
I drove the slumber party home.

15:05.488 --> 15:07.574
There's still one girl here, I think.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.617
-I know what we can do.
-What?

15:09.701 --> 15:11.036
We could trap El Diablo.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.871
With him gone, the king can return.

15:12.954 --> 15:15.331
That's ridic-- Oh, he just looked
right into my eyes.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.374
See?

15:16.458 --> 15:19.836
Oh, my God, he just raised his paw.
I think he just gave me the double guns.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.629
We could hire Teddy to help us.

15:21.713 --> 15:22.964
He has a live animal trap

15:23.048 --> 15:25.467
from the time he thought a squirrel
was stealing his mail.

15:25.550 --> 15:28.636
Sure, that-- Hey, buddy. How you doing?
Let's put a hat on him.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.222
All right! You hear that, El Diablo?
We're coming for you.

15:31.306 --> 15:33.433
Let's just keep this a secret
from the kids, right?

15:33.516 --> 15:35.727
We don't want them coming in here
and getting bitten.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.896
Aw, babies getting rabies.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.031
Why don't we tell Mom and Dad
about Jessica?

15:48.114 --> 15:50.492
-They could make her come out.
-Oh, no. She's mine.

15:50.575 --> 15:53.328
Mom is not gonna have anything more
to do with this slumber party.

15:53.411 --> 15:54.537
You hear that, Jessica?

15:54.621 --> 15:57.415
Or should I say Jessi-can't
find what she's looking for?

15:57.499 --> 16:00.543
Yeah, I hear you. But all it sounds like
is this.

16:00.627 --> 16:01.628
You know what, Jessica?

16:01.711 --> 16:04.422
Why do you even want to stick around here,
sweet baby?

16:04.506 --> 16:06.758
This slumber party's
not good enough for you.

16:06.841 --> 16:08.968
Yeah, the hors d'oeuvres were blah.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.845
And Louise's family kind of smells.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.972
Tell me what you're looking for
and I'll help you

16:13.056 --> 16:14.224
so you'll leave my house.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.559
I can't. And I can't tell you why I can't.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.395
Oh, and also I won't.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.480
Don't be boring and mysterious, Jessica.

16:20.563 --> 16:21.981
You can't have it both ways!

16:22.065 --> 16:23.692
- Gotta go. Click.
- She hung up.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.151
She didn't hang up.

16:25.235 --> 16:26.236
Louise, look!

16:27.737 --> 16:28.905
Louise, you should say,

16:28.988 --> 16:31.032
"I'll take what's behind curtain
number one."

16:31.116 --> 16:33.243
Because she's there behind the curtain.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.121
Jessica, it's curtains for you.

16:36.204 --> 16:37.664
Oh, that's better.

16:40.709 --> 16:44.838
Who could be hiding behind
our living room curtain? I wonder.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.756
It could be Dad. He has dainty feet.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.550
And Dad likes to hide from us sometimes.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.260
Okay, it's me. Happy now?

16:50.343 --> 16:51.928
I'll be happy when you leave.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.471
I'll leave when I find my thing.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.432
Until then, slumber party on.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.058
All right, you want a slumber party?

16:57.142 --> 17:00.520
Then say pillow to my little friend!

17:00.603 --> 17:03.857
-Whoa, pillow fight.
-It's about to go down.

17:03.940 --> 17:04.941
Goose down.

17:09.279 --> 17:10.572
I know you're close, Jessica.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.907
I can hear your boring breathing.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.456
-Oh, Tina?
-Yes?

17:20.832 --> 17:23.543
Gene, is this your first time
as a human shield?

17:23.626 --> 17:25.045
-Yeah.
-It's my third time.

17:25.128 --> 17:26.880
-You're doing great.
-Thank you.

17:31.343 --> 17:32.969
I'm gonna knock you out the door!

17:33.053 --> 17:35.638
Gene, get me the memory foam pillows
from Mom and Dad's room.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.724
Fat Man and Little Boy? On it!

17:38.183 --> 17:39.768
I came as quickly as I could.

17:39.851 --> 17:43.646
-Is it true? Was the king deposed?
-Yup. There's the bastard now.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.315
Yeah, look at him. El Diablo.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.859
When did you both become
crazy raccoon people?

17:47.942 --> 17:50.070
Linda's been telling me stories
about these guys.

17:50.153 --> 17:52.322
It's like I'm part of their magical world.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.449
Let's set up the trap
and get this over with.

17:54.532 --> 17:56.534
-What are we gonna bait it with? The bait.
-Huh?

17:56.618 --> 17:58.912
-Bobby, you can make him a burger.
-Burger, yeah!

17:58.995 --> 18:01.039
-He won't be able to resist.
-Right.

18:01.122 --> 18:03.333
Guys, I don't want to make a burger
for a raccoon.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.626
Please, Bobby?

18:04.709 --> 18:06.586
You can even name it like you like to do.

18:06.670 --> 18:08.797
You call it a Medium Snare burger.

18:09.881 --> 18:12.300
-Right? No, wait. The Cage-in burger.
-Mm.

18:12.384 --> 18:14.761
Get it? Because he's gonna be in a cage?

18:14.844 --> 18:16.763
Fine, I'll do it. But I'm not naming it.

18:16.846 --> 18:19.349
Oh, good, all right, yay.
Bobby, thank you!

18:19.432 --> 18:21.226
Medium Snare burger. Right, Bob?

18:21.309 --> 18:22.477
That wasn't so hard.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.853
Bob makes it sound so hard.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.273
Having fun. Jessica?

18:28.066 --> 18:30.235
Oh, yeah! Tons!

18:30.819 --> 18:33.488
Thanks for inviting me!

18:35.865 --> 18:37.659
Raccoon! Raccoon in the tub!

18:37.742 --> 18:40.495
What the-- Give it! Give it!

18:40.578 --> 18:44.666
I'm no park ranger, but if a weird raccoon
is holding something, let him keep it.

18:44.749 --> 18:49.087
What! Raccoon! Raccoon in the tub!
Code orange! Code orange!

18:49.170 --> 18:50.463
Give it! Give it!

18:52.215 --> 18:53.675
-Give me that!
-What is it?

18:53.758 --> 18:54.843
Pajama bottoms?

18:54.926 --> 18:57.137
And they're wet with pee?

18:57.220 --> 18:58.388
Are you a bed wetter?

18:58.471 --> 19:00.432
-Is that what this is all about?
-It's not pee!

19:00.515 --> 19:03.268
If it is, that raccoon
really likes your pee, Jessica.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.687
-What's your secret?
-No! It wasn't me!

19:05.770 --> 19:09.190
Your mom came in here and she peed
all over the place. I saw it!

19:09.274 --> 19:10.942
Mm, that does sound like Mom.

19:11.860 --> 19:13.278
Whoa.

19:13.361 --> 19:16.031
Whatever your pee is selling,
that raccoon is buying.

19:16.114 --> 19:19.284
Great, everybody have a big laugh.
Ha-ha-ha.

19:19.534 --> 19:20.994
Do you think this is gonna work?

19:21.077 --> 19:22.954
-Have faith in your burger, Bobby.
-Look.

19:23.038 --> 19:24.330
He's going for it.

19:24.414 --> 19:25.790
Oops, I spoke too soon.

19:25.874 --> 19:28.626
What if he doesn't like your burger?
That would be embarrassing.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.754
-Shh. He's gonna like it.
-Not necessarily. Look.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.173
Sniffing around. He does not like
what he smells, Bobby.

19:33.256 --> 19:34.841
I'm not arguing this with you, Teddy.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.594
You didn't cook it well enough.
You didn't cook it well enough.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.929
Should've put some ketchup on--
Nope, he's eating it.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.681
Going home, huh, Jessica?

19:41.765 --> 19:45.185
Yup, just waiting for your dad
to come back so he can drive me.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.062
Good. You really cut into my night.

19:47.145 --> 19:50.023
So, I guess you're gonna tell
everyone at school about this, right?

19:50.106 --> 19:52.442
-I'm not gonna tell anybody. I'm no narc.
-Oh.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.110
Make fun of you for wetting the bed?

19:54.194 --> 19:56.279
What is this, the '90s? Come on.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.947
You got a good system, though, huh?

19:58.031 --> 20:00.283
Bring plastic bags, go to bed early,
then get up first

20:00.367 --> 20:02.077
-and dispose of the evidence?
-Yup.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.870
So, why go to slumber parties at all?

20:03.953 --> 20:06.206
My mom makes me. She's out of control.

20:06.289 --> 20:08.083
Well, I wouldn't know anything about that.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.168
-Psych, my mom's crazy, too.
-Oh.

20:10.251 --> 20:12.170
You're pretty good
with a pillow by the way.

20:12.253 --> 20:13.588
Thanks. Self-taught.

20:13.672 --> 20:15.548
So, do you get a lot of raccoons in here?

20:15.632 --> 20:17.300
-Why, you jealous?
-Yeah, a little bit.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.010
Hey, what are you two still doing up?

20:19.094 --> 20:21.763
Oh, do you want a ride home now, Jessica?

20:21.846 --> 20:23.556
Okay, I guess it's time.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.893
What? It's a slumber party.
Why would she go home?

20:26.976 --> 20:29.562
Whoa, wait a second.
You two are having a good time.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.314
Ugh! Mom, stop!

20:31.398 --> 20:34.818
-Aw, my little BFFs.
-Shush!

20:34.901 --> 20:37.821
I knew you'd like it. It all
worked out the way I thought it would.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.281
-Tomorrow we're going clothes shopping.
-No!

20:40.365 --> 20:42.742
-Yeah. Yeah.
-No.

20:42.826 --> 20:44.786
Here he goes. He's almost out.

20:44.869 --> 20:47.455
Go, Bobby, go! Aw, sorry, King.

20:47.539 --> 20:49.124
-Great broom work, Dad.
-Yeah!

20:49.207 --> 20:50.625
If I was a raccoon, I'd leave.

20:50.709 --> 20:53.461
He's out. Now we can all go to bed.

20:54.546 --> 20:58.842
Psst. King! Drink responsibly.
Okay, good night.
