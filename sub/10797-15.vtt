<i>Captain's Log,</i>

00:01.333 --> 00:05.792
<i>Stardate 41309.5:</i>

00:05.792 --> 00:08.083
<i>We are in orbit</i>

00:05.792 --> 00:08.083
<i>around Persephone V</i>

00:08.083 --> 00:09.458

00:09.458 --> 00:11.709
<i>to confer</i>

00:09.458 --> 00:11.709
<i>with Admiral Mark Jameson</i>

00:11.709 --> 00:14.917
<i>in regard</i>

00:11.709 --> 00:14.917
<i>to an extraordinary situation.</i>

00:14.917 --> 00:18.125
Starfleet received

00:14.917 --> 00:18.125
this subspace transmission

00:18.125 --> 00:19.583
two days ago, Admiral.

00:19.583 --> 00:21.125
Let's see it, Captain.

00:21.125 --> 00:22.417
On viewer.

00:26.875 --> 00:29.959
I am Karnas,

00:26.875 --> 00:29.959
governor of Mordan IV.

00:29.959 --> 00:32.959
A dissident group

00:29.959 --> 00:32.959
of terrorists have taken

00:32.959 --> 00:36.750
Federation Ambassador Hawkins

00:32.959 --> 00:36.750
and his staff hostage.

00:36.750 --> 00:39.083
They will not

00:36.750 --> 00:39.083
discuss terms with me.

00:39.083 --> 00:42.458
This is a crisis

00:39.083 --> 00:42.458
I cannot resolve.

00:42.458 --> 00:46.166
The terrorists are demanding

00:42.458 --> 00:46.166
a Federation negotiator.

00:46.166 --> 00:48.208
I feel there is

00:46.166 --> 00:48.208
only one negotiator

00:48.208 --> 00:51.750
with the skills

00:48.208 --> 00:51.750
to resolve this situation.

00:51.750 --> 00:54.000
The lives of the hostages

00:51.750 --> 00:54.000
will depend

00:54.000 --> 00:57.667
on Starfleet delivering

00:54.000 --> 00:57.667
this man to Mordan--

00:57.667 --> 00:59.875
Commander Mark Jameson.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.959
<i>Admiral</i> Jameson.

01:01.959 --> 01:04.875
The terrorists have given you

01:01.959 --> 01:04.875
six Earth days

01:04.875 --> 01:09.750
to bring him here

01:04.875 --> 01:09.750
or the hostages will die.

01:09.750 --> 01:11.792
PICARD:

01:09.750 --> 01:11.792
Starfleet cannot

01:09.750 --> 01:11.792
understand

01:11.792 --> 01:14.208
how or why this crisis

01:11.792 --> 01:14.208
has developed.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.083
Mordan IV has finally

01:14.208 --> 01:16.083
gained peace

01:16.083 --> 01:17.834
after decades

01:16.083 --> 01:17.834
of civil war.

01:17.834 --> 01:20.750
40 years of civil war, Captain.

01:20.750 --> 01:22.083
Yes, sir.

01:22.083 --> 01:24.166
Karnas was largely responsible

01:24.166 --> 01:26.166
for the planet's unification

01:24.166 --> 01:26.166
and peace.

01:26.166 --> 01:28.834
Why should he now

01:26.166 --> 01:28.834
be unable to deal

01:28.834 --> 01:31.125
with this rebellious faction?

01:31.125 --> 01:33.125
45 years ago

01:33.125 --> 01:37.125
I negotiated a hostage situation

01:33.125 --> 01:37.125
on Mordan, Captain.

01:37.125 --> 01:42.041
Karnas was a young man then,

01:37.125 --> 01:42.041
but so was I.

01:42.041 --> 01:45.250
He seems to feel that I can

01:42.041 --> 01:45.250
handle the situation again.

01:45.250 --> 01:47.083
I'm detailed to take you

01:45.250 --> 01:47.083
to Mordan IV

01:47.083 --> 01:49.291
as soon as you

01:47.083 --> 01:49.291
can be ready, Admiral.

01:49.291 --> 01:54.333
My wife and I will beam aboard

01:49.291 --> 01:54.333
at 1500 hours, Captain.

01:54.333 --> 01:55.917
Acknowledge.

01:55.917 --> 01:57.417
Received and acknowledged, sir.

01:57.417 --> 01:58.417
Picard out.

01:58.417 --> 02:00.792
Nearly 1500 now, sir.

02:02.041 --> 02:03.333
Well, Number One

02:03.333 --> 02:06.166
let's go and welcome

02:03.333 --> 02:06.166
the Admiral aboard.

02:16.792 --> 02:19.792
Welcome aboard, Admiral.

02:19.792 --> 02:22.834
This is my executive officer,

02:19.792 --> 02:22.834
Commander William Riker.

02:22.834 --> 02:23.834
My pleasure, sir.

02:23.834 --> 02:24.875
Ma'am.

02:24.875 --> 02:27.333
My wife, Anne.

02:27.333 --> 02:31.208
Captain, there are certain

02:27.333 --> 02:31.208
details of this mission

02:31.208 --> 02:33.792
that you should understand

02:31.208 --> 02:33.792
before we begin.

02:33.792 --> 02:35.000
Yes, sir.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.625
I am not simply

02:35.000 --> 02:36.625
an advisor.

02:36.625 --> 02:38.834
On any assignment

02:36.625 --> 02:38.834
I accompany

02:38.834 --> 02:42.041
Starfleet has designated me

02:38.834 --> 02:42.041
Senior Mission Officer.

02:42.041 --> 02:44.458
I control the away team

02:42.041 --> 02:44.458
and all its actions.

02:44.458 --> 02:46.458
Is that understood?

02:46.458 --> 02:48.083
Of course, Captain

02:48.083 --> 02:49.875
you command the ship

02:49.875 --> 02:52.208
but the mission is mine.

02:52.208 --> 02:54.834
I trust you are

02:52.208 --> 02:54.834
in full agreement.

02:56.834 --> 02:58.250
Yes, sir.

02:58.250 --> 02:59.709
Of course.

03:20.750 --> 03:25.083
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

03:25.083 --> 03:29.291
<i>These are the voyages</i>

03:25.083 --> 03:29.291
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

03:29.291 --> 03:31.208
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

03:31.208 --> 03:35.041
<i>to explore</i>

03:31.208 --> 03:35.041
<i>strange new worlds</i>

03:35.041 --> 03:39.750
<i>to seek out new life</i>

03:35.041 --> 03:39.750
<i>and new civilizations</i>

03:39.750 --> 03:44.291
<i>to boldly go</i>

03:39.750 --> 03:44.291
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

04:51.333 --> 04:55.166
Message coming in

04:51.333 --> 04:55.166
from Mordan, sir.

04:55.166 --> 04:59.041
Put it on the

04:55.166 --> 04:59.041
screen, Mr. Data.

04:59.041 --> 05:00.959
Mordan IV to<i> Enterprise.</i>

05:00.959 --> 05:01.959
This is Karnas.

05:01.959 --> 05:03.792
I will speak to the Captain.

05:03.792 --> 05:05.750
I am Captain Picard

05:05.750 --> 05:07.375
commanding

05:05.750 --> 05:07.375
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

05:07.375 --> 05:09.750
Is Admiral Jameson on board?

05:09.750 --> 05:12.333
He's here beside

05:09.750 --> 05:12.333
my First Officer.

05:12.333 --> 05:14.500
Do you wish to

05:12.333 --> 05:14.500
speak to him now?

05:14.500 --> 05:19.583
So, Jameson, I see time

05:14.500 --> 05:19.583
has not been kind.

05:19.583 --> 05:21.417
It seldom is, Karnas.

05:21.417 --> 05:25.583
However, we could save

05:21.417 --> 05:25.583
a good deal of it now

05:25.583 --> 05:27.750
if you'll outline

05:25.583 --> 05:27.750
the terrorists' demands.

05:27.750 --> 05:29.166
They insist

05:29.166 --> 05:31.750
all discussions will take place

05:29.166 --> 05:31.750
here on Mordan.

05:31.750 --> 05:36.000
They refuse to speak to me--

05:31.750 --> 05:36.000
only to a Federation mediator.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.458
They say

05:36.000 --> 05:39.458
they will brook no excuses.

05:39.458 --> 05:40.750
If there are any offered

05:40.750 --> 05:43.375
your ambassador

05:40.750 --> 05:43.375
and his people will die...

05:43.375 --> 05:44.792
...unpleasantly.

05:44.792 --> 05:46.250
I believe them.

05:46.250 --> 05:48.000
So should you, Admiral.

05:49.500 --> 05:55.375
Tell them I accept

05:49.500 --> 05:55.375
the conditions of negotiation.

05:55.375 --> 05:58.375
I will do so immediately.

05:58.375 --> 06:00.875
For a man in his position

06:00.875 --> 06:03.166
he doesn't seem to know much

06:00.875 --> 06:03.166
about the situation.

06:03.166 --> 06:05.625
Wrong, Number One.

06:05.625 --> 06:08.208
He told me that the terrorists

06:08.208 --> 06:11.500
are desperate enough to kill

06:08.208 --> 06:11.500
if they are crossed.

06:11.500 --> 06:14.875
They are willing

06:11.500 --> 06:14.875
to talk one on one

06:14.875 --> 06:17.625
but not to him.

06:17.625 --> 06:19.041
Counselor?

06:19.041 --> 06:21.000
From his body language

06:21.000 --> 06:22.875
as well as

06:21.000 --> 06:22.875
his words and tone

06:22.875 --> 06:26.375
I judge that what

06:22.875 --> 06:26.375
Karnas said was honest

06:26.375 --> 06:29.583
but I sensed

06:26.375 --> 06:29.583
a holding back.

06:29.583 --> 06:31.959
Perhaps he knows more

06:29.583 --> 06:31.959
about the terrorists

06:31.959 --> 06:33.458
than he's prepared to admit.

06:33.458 --> 06:37.583
Possible, but I suspect

06:33.458 --> 06:37.583
it's closer to the mark

06:37.583 --> 06:41.041
if we said

06:37.583 --> 06:41.041
he doesn't want to admit

06:41.041 --> 06:44.542
failure of his own

06:41.041 --> 06:44.542
efforts to negotiate.

06:44.542 --> 06:46.417
He is

06:44.542 --> 06:46.417
a proud man.

06:46.417 --> 06:47.875
That could be, sir.

06:47.875 --> 06:51.083
Karnas has established

06:47.875 --> 06:51.083
himself as a powerful man

06:51.083 --> 06:52.500
on Mordan.

06:52.500 --> 06:56.333
Suddenly, in this situation,

06:52.500 --> 06:56.333
his power is useless.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.000
BEVERLY:

06:56.333 --> 06:58.000
Sick Bay to Bridge.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.375
I'm ready

06:58.000 --> 07:00.375
for Admiral Jameson now.

07:00.375 --> 07:02.208
In a few moments, Doctor.

07:02.208 --> 07:05.125
Ready for what, Captain?

07:05.125 --> 07:07.625
It's just a routine

07:05.125 --> 07:07.625
medical checkup.

07:07.625 --> 07:09.750
Ship's regulations.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.333
What I don't

07:17.750 --> 07:19.333
understand, sir

07:19.333 --> 07:22.500
is how Karnas knew

07:19.333 --> 07:22.500
that you were still available.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.375
Still alive,

07:22.500 --> 07:24.375
you mean.

07:24.375 --> 07:26.625
So far as he knew, sir,

07:24.375 --> 07:26.625
you could have been dead.

07:26.625 --> 07:29.041
Quite right, Commander,

07:26.625 --> 07:29.041
but I am not

07:29.041 --> 07:32.333
and I imagine Ambassador Hawkins

07:29.041 --> 07:32.333
has told him that.

07:32.333 --> 07:34.500
I briefed the ambassador

07:32.333 --> 07:34.500
about Mordan

07:34.500 --> 07:37.208
before he left

07:34.500 --> 07:37.208
to take up residence.

07:37.208 --> 07:39.250
PICARD:

07:37.208 --> 07:39.250
All right, Karnas

07:37.208 --> 07:39.250
has a problem

07:39.250 --> 07:40.834
he thinks you

07:39.250 --> 07:40.834
can resolve.

07:40.834 --> 07:42.208
What do the terrorists need

07:42.208 --> 07:45.667
that Karnas can't

07:42.208 --> 07:45.667
or won't give them?

07:45.667 --> 07:48.041
DATA:

07:45.667 --> 07:48.041
Mordan's had peace

07:45.667 --> 07:48.041
for five years.

07:48.041 --> 07:50.333
They have finally come

07:48.041 --> 07:50.333
to a state of productivity

07:50.333 --> 07:52.458
which satisfies

07:50.333 --> 07:52.458
their planetary needs

07:52.458 --> 07:54.208
but no more than that.

07:54.208 --> 07:57.000
Perhaps the dissidents

07:54.208 --> 07:57.000
feel the Federation

07:57.000 --> 07:58.375
could provide them with more.

07:58.375 --> 08:00.500
JAMESON:

07:58.375 --> 08:00.500
I have negotiated

07:58.375 --> 08:00.500
many treaties

08:00.500 --> 08:02.250
on many planets, Picard.

08:02.250 --> 08:05.208
I have found that peace

08:02.250 --> 08:05.208
or the appearance of it

08:05.208 --> 08:07.333
is often a prelude to war.

08:07.333 --> 08:10.000
Admiral, are you suggesting

08:10.000 --> 08:12.500
the terrorists want arms

08:10.000 --> 08:12.500
and weapons?

08:12.500 --> 08:15.208
They may.

08:12.500 --> 08:15.208
I am suggesting that Karnas

08:15.208 --> 08:17.875
is the last man to give them

08:15.208 --> 08:17.875
such weapons.

08:17.875 --> 08:20.375
TROI:

08:17.875 --> 08:20.375
I see. You believe

08:17.875 --> 08:20.375
that Karnas

08:20.375 --> 08:23.125
would not negotiate

08:20.375 --> 08:23.125
on that point

08:23.125 --> 08:27.083
and so the terrorists demanded

08:23.125 --> 08:27.083
an outside negotiator.

08:27.083 --> 08:29.792
I know Karnas.

08:27.083 --> 08:29.792
He is a warrior.

08:29.792 --> 08:31.041
He lives for challenge.

08:31.041 --> 08:33.125
These people have

08:31.041 --> 08:33.125
insulted his honor

08:33.125 --> 08:35.542
by taking the embassy

08:33.125 --> 08:35.542
staff hostage.

08:35.542 --> 08:37.250
Now, I'll negotiate

08:37.250 --> 08:40.917
but I'll have to be very careful

08:37.250 --> 08:40.917
in dealing with Karnas.

08:40.917 --> 08:42.750
He'll want revenge

08:42.750 --> 08:44.333
for that insult.

08:49.583 --> 08:51.417
(<i> beeping</i> )

08:54.709 --> 08:57.041
Well...

08:57.041 --> 08:59.208
About time.

08:59.208 --> 09:00.959
Couldn't get away

08:59.208 --> 09:00.959
from the Bridge?

09:00.959 --> 09:02.792
Didn't want to.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.959
Feels good to be

09:02.792 --> 09:04.959
on one again.

09:06.709 --> 09:08.625
I'm glad, Mark.

09:08.625 --> 09:10.583
You want me

09:08.625 --> 09:10.583
to help you up?

09:13.417 --> 09:15.333
(<i> groaning</i> )

09:20.959 --> 09:23.917
You're stronger today.

09:23.917 --> 09:25.208
I'm fine.

09:25.208 --> 09:27.125
I feel like a kid again.

09:28.750 --> 09:31.834
This ship is

09:28.750 --> 09:31.834
magnificent.

09:31.834 --> 09:33.250
It even has

09:31.834 --> 09:33.250
family quarters.

09:33.250 --> 09:35.000
(<i> groaning</i> )

09:35.000 --> 09:38.583
Pity we didn't have them

09:35.000 --> 09:38.583
20, 30 years ago.

09:38.583 --> 09:42.250
We could have been together

09:38.583 --> 09:42.250
almost all of your career.

09:42.250 --> 09:43.458
(<i> beeping</i> )

09:43.458 --> 09:46.750
(<i> groaning</i> )

09:46.750 --> 09:48.333
Mark!

09:48.333 --> 09:50.250
Mark!

09:50.250 --> 09:51.208
I'll get Sick Bay.

09:51.208 --> 09:53.250
No. No.

09:53.250 --> 09:54.375
There's no need.

09:54.375 --> 09:57.792
It's happened

09:54.375 --> 09:57.792
before.

09:57.792 --> 09:59.125
When?

09:59.125 --> 10:00.959
You haven't said anything.

10:00.959 --> 10:02.417
It'll pass.

10:02.417 --> 10:04.458
Just give me

10:02.417 --> 10:04.458
a moment.

10:05.750 --> 10:08.125
See, I'm... I'm better.

10:08.125 --> 10:09.458
It's going away.

10:11.083 --> 10:12.542
What is it?

10:12.542 --> 10:14.375
Do... the doctors know?

10:14.375 --> 10:16.458
Just body changes.

10:16.458 --> 10:17.583
Last checkup

10:17.583 --> 10:19.959
they said I... I'd

10:17.583 --> 10:19.959
have to expect it.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.875
You're sure?

10:23.875 --> 10:25.875
Don't lie to me.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.959
I'm sure.

10:29.417 --> 10:32.583
Oh...

10:32.583 --> 10:36.083
All the medical information

10:32.583 --> 10:36.083
the Admiral provided

10:36.083 --> 10:37.458
is satisfactory, sir.

10:37.458 --> 10:38.875
Excellent, Doctor.

10:38.875 --> 10:40.542
Except for one thing.

10:40.542 --> 10:43.792
The test results he gave me

10:40.542 --> 10:43.792
aren't two days old.

10:43.792 --> 10:45.333
They're two months old.

10:45.333 --> 10:47.792
The medical records coder

10:45.333 --> 10:47.792
always includes the date

10:47.792 --> 10:49.500
as part of the file number.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.500
He lied to me, sir,

10:49.500 --> 10:52.500
and I don't know why.

10:53.792 --> 10:56.333
He is 85 years old, Doctor.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.083
For some, the memory begins

10:56.333 --> 10:58.083
to fail.

10:58.083 --> 11:00.166
He suffers

10:58.083 --> 11:00.166
from Iverson's disease, sir.

11:00.166 --> 11:01.417
That affects the body

11:01.417 --> 11:03.583
not the mind.

11:03.583 --> 11:05.750
Now, I have a gut feeling

11:03.583 --> 11:05.750
he's hiding something.

11:06.709 --> 11:07.917
Now, that is an observation

11:07.917 --> 11:09.875
I would expect

11:07.917 --> 11:09.875
from Counselor Troi.

11:13.041 --> 11:14.917
Doctor.

11:17.667 --> 11:22.375
Doctor, I do respect

11:17.667 --> 11:22.375
your opinion, and...

11:22.375 --> 11:24.917
I want you on the Bridge

11:22.375 --> 11:24.917
for the next day or so.

11:24.917 --> 11:27.166
The Admiral must remain

11:24.917 --> 11:27.166
in the best of health

11:27.166 --> 11:28.792
for these negotiations

11:28.792 --> 11:32.709
and he might require

11:28.792 --> 11:32.709
your services.

11:38.125 --> 11:40.834
Admiral, we're approaching

11:38.125 --> 11:40.834
the Idini Star Cluster.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.291
Would you like

11:40.834 --> 11:42.291
to take the conn

11:42.291 --> 11:44.291
as we make transit?

11:44.291 --> 11:47.709
Thank you, Captain. I would.

12:10.667 --> 12:12.709
(<i> gasping</i> )

12:23.875 --> 12:28.834
Well, Admiral, quite a little

12:23.875 --> 12:28.834
surprise you've pulled on us.

12:28.834 --> 12:31.417
Yes, quite.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.792
Neglected to mention.

12:33.792 --> 12:37.208
I began some new

12:33.792 --> 12:37.208
therapy before... I left.

12:37.208 --> 12:38.583
Seems to be working.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.333
I haven't felt this good

12:40.333 --> 12:41.959
since the last time

12:40.333 --> 12:41.959
I was in space--

12:41.959 --> 12:43.542
the<i> Gettysburg.</i>

12:43.542 --> 12:46.834
All I needed to get me out of

12:43.542 --> 12:46.834
that chair was the thought

12:46.834 --> 12:50.333
of walking the decks

12:46.834 --> 12:50.333
in command of a starship again.

12:50.333 --> 12:53.083
Admiral, you only have

12:50.333 --> 12:53.083
the conn temporarily.

12:53.083 --> 12:54.834
A figure of speech.

12:54.834 --> 12:56.417
Of course she's your ship.

12:56.417 --> 13:00.875
I'll just keep an eye

12:56.417 --> 13:00.875
on her for a while.

13:12.792 --> 13:16.583
The Admiral displayed

13:12.792 --> 13:16.583
a remarkable improvement.

13:16.583 --> 13:19.542
Captain, no one recovers

13:16.583 --> 13:19.542
from Iverson's disease.

13:19.542 --> 13:20.542
There's no known cure.

13:20.542 --> 13:21.583
There have been no cases

13:21.583 --> 13:22.709
where it's gone

13:21.583 --> 13:22.709
into remission.

13:22.709 --> 13:24.375
I have never heard

13:22.709 --> 13:24.375
of any therapy

13:24.375 --> 13:26.125
that would produce

13:24.375 --> 13:26.125
results like that.

13:26.125 --> 13:27.417
Then how do you

13:26.125 --> 13:27.417
account for it?

13:27.417 --> 13:29.375
I can't. All I can tell you

13:29.375 --> 13:30.834
is that the Admiral

13:29.375 --> 13:30.834
has been confined

13:30.834 --> 13:32.709
to his support chair

13:30.834 --> 13:32.709
for the last four years

13:32.709 --> 13:34.083
by the effects of Iverson's.

13:34.083 --> 13:36.000
By all the medical

13:34.083 --> 13:36.000
facts we know

13:36.000 --> 13:38.709
he should never

13:36.000 --> 13:38.709
have walked again.

13:38.709 --> 13:41.458
I want you to look into it,

13:38.709 --> 13:41.458
Doctor-- thoroughly.

13:41.458 --> 13:43.208
Yes, sir.

13:43.208 --> 13:44.917
The terrorists have given you

13:44.917 --> 13:46.875
six Earth days

13:44.917 --> 13:46.875
to bring him here

13:46.875 --> 13:51.291
or the hostages will die.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.291
I don't know how much

13:54.125 --> 13:56.291
more information

13:56.291 --> 13:59.750
you think you can get

13:56.291 --> 13:59.750
from that tape.

13:59.750 --> 14:01.083
Mark!

14:01.083 --> 14:03.000
My God,

14:01.083 --> 14:03.000
what's happened?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.542
It's the new therapy

14:03.000 --> 14:04.542
I'm taking.

14:04.542 --> 14:06.583
It's... it's

14:04.542 --> 14:06.583
working, Annie.

14:06.583 --> 14:09.375
Oh, darling!

14:15.125 --> 14:16.750
Mark...?

14:16.750 --> 14:21.709
I told you I just needed

14:16.750 --> 14:21.709
to get back in space again.

14:21.709 --> 14:25.041
You really are

14:21.709 --> 14:25.041
looking much better.

14:25.041 --> 14:27.000
It's the new treatment.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.458
No.

14:29.458 --> 14:30.625
Come here.

14:30.625 --> 14:32.583
I hope you're heading

14:30.625 --> 14:32.583
for the bedroom.

14:32.583 --> 14:34.667
You stop it.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.625
Darling...

14:37.625 --> 14:41.250
you look like you

14:37.625 --> 14:41.250
looked 20 years ago.

14:41.250 --> 14:43.083
You flatter me.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.458
Now you tell me what the hell

14:43.083 --> 14:45.458
is going on.

14:45.458 --> 14:47.000
(<i> gasping and groaning</i> )

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
I don't know.

14:48.000 --> 14:48.959
Mark!

14:48.959 --> 14:51.709
(<i> groaning</i> )

14:51.709 --> 14:52.709
Sick Bay.

14:52.709 --> 14:53.709
Medical emergency

14:53.709 --> 14:55.458
in the Admiral's

14:53.709 --> 14:55.458
quarters.

14:55.458 --> 14:57.583
(<i> groaning</i> )

15:00.500 --> 15:02.375
I found traces

15:00.500 --> 15:02.375
of chemical substances

15:02.375 --> 15:04.125
in his blood

15:02.375 --> 15:04.125
and tissue samples

15:04.125 --> 15:06.667
but none of them are

15:04.125 --> 15:06.667
in our pharmacopoeia.

15:06.667 --> 15:08.542
I'm still working

15:06.667 --> 15:08.542
on alien references

15:08.542 --> 15:10.166
to substances

15:08.542 --> 15:10.166
like these.

15:10.166 --> 15:11.625
All I can tell you

15:11.625 --> 15:13.250
is that he's

15:11.625 --> 15:13.250
ingested something

15:13.250 --> 15:14.917
that's strongly

15:13.250 --> 15:14.917
affecting his body.

15:14.917 --> 15:16.208
Specifics, Doctor.

15:16.208 --> 15:17.917
Captain, there's so

15:16.208 --> 15:17.917
many things going on

15:17.917 --> 15:20.500
I can't give you specifics

15:17.917 --> 15:20.500
until I do a lot more tests.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.500
Well, give me

15:20.500 --> 15:22.500
what you have now.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.542
His red cell count

15:22.500 --> 15:24.542
is running riot.

15:24.542 --> 15:27.291
The cellular structure of his

15:24.542 --> 15:27.291
body is radically changing.

15:27.291 --> 15:28.750
We can't make

15:27.291 --> 15:28.750
any decisions on that

15:28.750 --> 15:30.709
until we know

15:28.750 --> 15:30.709
what it's changing<i> to.</i>

15:30.709 --> 15:32.333
His DNA is skewed.

15:32.333 --> 15:33.625
Don't ask me how

15:33.625 --> 15:35.667
but he even

15:33.625 --> 15:35.667
<i>looks</i> younger.

15:35.667 --> 15:37.208
And Captain--

15:37.208 --> 15:40.625
there are absolutely no traces

15:37.208 --> 15:40.625
of Iverson's disease.

15:40.625 --> 15:43.000
You said there was no cure

15:40.625 --> 15:43.000
for Iverson's.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.083
None that we know of.

15:45.083 --> 15:46.750
Well, whatever

15:45.083 --> 15:46.750
these substances

15:46.750 --> 15:47.917
are doing to his body

15:47.917 --> 15:49.291
at least they've

15:47.917 --> 15:49.291
done that for him.

15:49.291 --> 15:51.792
But how or why?

15:51.792 --> 15:55.166
It's too early to say.

15:55.166 --> 16:00.291
Get me some answers, Doctor,

15:55.166 --> 16:00.291
as soon as possible.

16:00.291 --> 16:01.959
Yes, sir.

16:03.709 --> 16:05.917
(<i> door chimes</i> )

16:08.417 --> 16:09.583
Captain.

16:09.583 --> 16:12.375
Mrs. Jameson, I have

16:09.583 --> 16:12.375
to ask the Admiral

16:12.375 --> 16:14.000
some questions.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.625
Ask away.

16:19.041 --> 16:21.583
There's nothing

16:19.041 --> 16:21.583
to hide now.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.208
Admiral, in addition

16:25.500 --> 16:27.208
to your rank

16:27.208 --> 16:30.792
you are a particularly

16:27.208 --> 16:30.792
valuable commodity just now.

16:30.792 --> 16:33.834
Starfleet has a right

16:30.792 --> 16:33.834
to some answers.

16:33.834 --> 16:36.750
I had planned this

16:33.834 --> 16:36.750
for a long time now--

16:36.750 --> 16:39.834
ever since I learned

16:36.750 --> 16:39.834
that I had Iverson's disease--

16:39.834 --> 16:41.625
since it put me

16:39.834 --> 16:41.625
in that chair.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.125
What did you do, Mark?

16:44.125 --> 16:47.083
There is a planet

16:44.125 --> 16:47.083
in the Cerebus system--

16:47.083 --> 16:48.458
Cerebus II--

16:48.458 --> 16:50.458
they say the natives there

16:48.458 --> 16:50.458
have a process

16:50.458 --> 16:53.917
that rejuvenates the body;

16:50.458 --> 16:53.917
gives you your youth back.

16:53.917 --> 16:56.458
Yes, I've heard of that story.

16:53.917 --> 16:56.458
It's a myth.

16:56.458 --> 16:58.166
It's true, Picard.

16:58.166 --> 17:00.000
I am living proof.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.500
Oh, it's dangerous.

17:01.500 --> 17:04.542
The mortality rate

17:01.500 --> 17:04.542
is high, and...

17:04.542 --> 17:06.792
it's very painful.

17:06.792 --> 17:09.583
Aliens are seldom allowed

17:06.792 --> 17:09.583
to obtain the process

17:09.583 --> 17:11.083
but I managed it.

17:11.083 --> 17:14.583
I negotiated a treaty

17:11.083 --> 17:14.583
for Cerebus II some years ago

17:14.583 --> 17:19.041
and they felt obligated to honor

17:14.583 --> 17:19.041
my request for the process.

17:19.041 --> 17:22.333
Obviously it works very rapidly,

17:19.041 --> 17:22.333
but how does it work?

17:22.333 --> 17:25.917
The herb and drug combinations

17:22.333 --> 17:25.917
are self-administered slowly

17:25.917 --> 17:28.291
over a period of two years.

17:28.291 --> 17:31.041
Every response

17:28.291 --> 17:31.041
is different

17:31.041 --> 17:32.583
depending on a being's DNA.

17:32.583 --> 17:34.500
I got enough

17:32.583 --> 17:34.500
for both of us, Annie

17:34.500 --> 17:36.709
but I had to test it

17:34.500 --> 17:36.709
on myself first.

17:36.709 --> 17:38.834
I-I couldn't risk you.

17:38.834 --> 17:41.333
If I died...

17:38.834 --> 17:41.333
well, I was half a man,

17:41.333 --> 17:43.875
so what did it matter?

17:43.875 --> 17:46.333
It would matter to me.

17:46.333 --> 17:48.583
But I was starting

17:46.333 --> 17:48.583
to change, Annie.

17:48.583 --> 17:50.792
It... it was

17:48.583 --> 17:50.792
almost undetectable

17:50.792 --> 17:53.000
but the improvement was there.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.041
And then when this hostage

17:53.000 --> 17:55.041
situation came up

17:55.041 --> 17:58.000
I... I knew I had to be

17:55.041 --> 17:58.000
at my peak to deal with it.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.583
I didn't have time to wait

17:58.000 --> 18:00.583
for the drug

18:00.583 --> 18:01.959
to-to work

18:00.583 --> 18:01.959
naturally.

18:01.959 --> 18:03.542
So you took the whole dose.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.333
I took<i> both</i> of them.

18:05.333 --> 18:07.041
And look at me,

18:05.333 --> 18:07.041
Annie!

18:07.041 --> 18:08.375
Look at me.

18:08.375 --> 18:10.500
I'm-I'm strong, I'm alert, fit.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.083
I'm fitter than you are, Picard

18:12.083 --> 18:14.208
and I'm getting

18:12.083 --> 18:14.208
younger.

18:21.125 --> 18:23.000
The only question I have,

18:21.125 --> 18:23.000
Admiral

18:23.000 --> 18:26.625
is why you thought

18:23.000 --> 18:26.625
it necessary to be young

18:26.625 --> 18:28.542
to negotiate the release

18:26.625 --> 18:28.542
of the hostages--

18:28.542 --> 18:31.709
even willing to put

18:28.542 --> 18:31.709
your life at risk for it.

18:37.625 --> 18:40.792
I'll be on the Bridge, Admiral,

18:37.625 --> 18:40.792
if you want to talk further.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.917
Why didn't you tell me, Mark?

18:52.917 --> 18:56.542
We've always been honest

18:52.917 --> 18:56.542
with each other until now.

18:56.542 --> 18:58.667
Annie, I did it for us.

18:58.667 --> 19:03.208
Oh... oh, I'm sure

18:58.667 --> 19:03.208
you believed that--

19:03.208 --> 19:06.125
until you had a chance

19:03.208 --> 19:06.125
to head up a mission

19:06.125 --> 19:07.917
and to

19:06.125 --> 19:07.917
command again.

19:07.917 --> 19:12.792
And then you just upended

19:07.917 --> 19:12.792
the bottle or whatever it was

19:12.792 --> 19:14.917
and damn everything.

19:14.917 --> 19:17.083
Did you think about me

19:17.083 --> 19:18.458
at all?

19:18.458 --> 19:22.333
I obtained enough of the dosage

19:18.458 --> 19:22.333
for both of us.

19:22.333 --> 19:25.166
But you never asked

19:22.333 --> 19:25.166
if I wanted it.

19:25.166 --> 19:26.959
It's just like you, Mark

19:26.959 --> 19:31.083
to assume that what you felt

19:26.959 --> 19:31.083
was right was the only answer.

19:31.083 --> 19:33.291
But it was the right answer

19:31.083 --> 19:33.291
for me.

19:33.291 --> 19:36.208
It was killing you having

19:33.291 --> 19:36.208
to take care of an invalid.

19:36.208 --> 19:38.041
Annie, what good was I to you?

19:38.041 --> 19:39.417
We can be together again.

19:39.417 --> 19:41.417
Let me go!

19:41.417 --> 19:44.166
I can get you another

19:41.417 --> 19:44.166
supply of the drug.

19:46.500 --> 19:49.709
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

20:05.458 --> 20:06.750
(<i> communications beep</i> )

20:06.750 --> 20:08.875
Commander Data

20:08.875 --> 20:14.250
I wish to open a communication

20:08.875 --> 20:14.250
frequency to Karnas.

20:14.250 --> 20:15.375
Aye, sir.

20:15.375 --> 20:16.917
One moment, Mr. Data.

20:16.917 --> 20:19.166
Admiral, this is Picard.

20:19.166 --> 20:21.959
May I know the reason

20:19.166 --> 20:21.959
for this communication?

20:21.959 --> 20:25.500
Karnas must have tried

20:21.959 --> 20:25.500
to negotiate with the terrorists

20:25.500 --> 20:27.291
before he was forced

20:25.500 --> 20:27.291
to call on me.

20:27.291 --> 20:30.834
I want all the information

20:27.291 --> 20:30.834
he has access to.

20:30.834 --> 20:33.834
You said Karnas was a proud man,

20:30.834 --> 20:33.834
Admiral, probably sensitive

20:33.834 --> 20:35.875
to his failure

20:33.834 --> 20:35.875
to deal with this situation.

20:35.875 --> 20:37.750
Is it wise to press him on this?

20:37.750 --> 20:39.875
I am the negotiator, Picard.

20:39.875 --> 20:42.500
Karnas will have to cooperate

20:39.875 --> 20:42.500
with me and the terrorists

20:42.500 --> 20:44.250
and damn his sensitivities.

20:44.250 --> 20:47.667
Then may I suggest

20:44.250 --> 20:47.667
a secure channel, Admiral?

20:47.667 --> 20:50.709
A sensible precaution, Picard.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.250
Make it so.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.834
Make it so.

20:54.834 --> 20:56.208
Aye, sir.

20:56.208 --> 20:59.709
Frequency open

20:56.208 --> 20:59.709
and secured.

20:59.709 --> 21:01.375
Karnas.

21:01.375 --> 21:03.333
What is it you want, Admiral?

21:03.333 --> 21:05.041
We're on a secure channel,

21:03.333 --> 21:05.041
Karnas.

21:05.041 --> 21:07.500
You can talk freely.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.625
Who's behind this thing?

21:09.625 --> 21:11.250
You said dissidents.

21:11.250 --> 21:14.875
Yes-- political opponents

21:11.250 --> 21:14.875
who feel the Federation

21:14.875 --> 21:17.583
will disavow me

21:14.875 --> 21:17.583
as governor if...

21:17.583 --> 21:20.166
if they stir up enough trouble

21:17.583 --> 21:20.166
here on Mordan.

21:20.166 --> 21:23.041
Then who is it? Ardan? Gilnor?

21:23.041 --> 21:26.458
They're dead, Jameson--

21:23.041 --> 21:26.458
a long time now.

21:26.458 --> 21:30.083
A long time I thought

21:26.458 --> 21:30.083
you were dead, too.

21:30.083 --> 21:32.875
I almost died a couple of times

21:30.083 --> 21:32.875
on missions

21:32.875 --> 21:35.583
but I always

21:32.875 --> 21:35.583
made it through somehow.

21:35.583 --> 21:38.959
Yes. Now you're coming

21:35.583 --> 21:38.959
back to Mordan

21:38.959 --> 21:41.041
to negotiate for hostages again.

21:41.041 --> 21:42.542
It's almost as though

21:42.542 --> 21:46.041
the 45 years in between

21:42.542 --> 21:46.041
never happened.

21:48.500 --> 21:51.417
You've never forgiven me.

21:51.417 --> 21:52.667
Of course I have.

21:52.667 --> 21:54.917
It-it was years ago.

21:56.709 --> 22:00.000
There are no dissidents,

21:56.709 --> 22:00.000
are there?

22:00.000 --> 22:01.583
No terrorists.

22:01.583 --> 22:03.333
You have the hostages!

22:03.333 --> 22:09.041
And if I have,

22:03.333 --> 22:09.041
you're coming to Mordan, Jameson

22:09.041 --> 22:11.875
and you're going to negotiate

22:09.041 --> 22:11.875
for their lives

22:11.875 --> 22:15.417
and I'm going to ask

22:11.875 --> 22:15.417
a very, very high price.

22:15.417 --> 22:17.250
What if I refuse?

22:17.250 --> 22:19.542
Then the hostages will die.

22:19.542 --> 22:22.291
You've seen

22:19.542 --> 22:22.291
how my executioners work.

22:22.291 --> 22:24.834
They are still as efficient

22:22.291 --> 22:24.834
as they were--

22:24.834 --> 22:27.208
perhaps even more skilled now.

22:27.208 --> 22:30.750
You'll come

22:30.750 --> 22:34.583
even if you don't have

22:30.750 --> 22:34.583
much honor left.

22:45.000 --> 22:50.041
Conn, are we still on schedule

22:45.000 --> 22:50.041
to arrive at Mordan

22:50.041 --> 22:51.000
in 38 hours?

22:51.000 --> 22:53.250
Aye, sir.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.250
We're at warp 4.

22:53.250 --> 22:55.875
Picard, I want to jump

22:53.250 --> 22:55.875
to warp 8

22:55.875 --> 22:59.000
so that we arrive ahead

22:55.875 --> 22:59.000
of our announced ETA.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.709
It will throw Karnas

22:59.000 --> 23:00.709
off balance

23:00.709 --> 23:03.458
and we can catch him

23:00.709 --> 23:03.458
before he's ready.

23:03.458 --> 23:05.375
Ready for what,

23:03.458 --> 23:05.375
exactly, Admiral?

23:05.375 --> 23:07.709
I believe Karnas

23:05.375 --> 23:07.709
has the hostages

23:07.709 --> 23:09.917
and there never were

23:07.709 --> 23:09.917
any dissidents.

23:09.917 --> 23:11.917
What has happened

23:09.917 --> 23:11.917
to bring you to

23:09.917 --> 23:11.917
that conclusion?

23:11.917 --> 23:13.041
That's quite a big jump.

23:13.041 --> 23:14.834
I'm not at liberty

23:13.041 --> 23:14.834
to say, Picard

23:14.834 --> 23:17.792
but negotiations are

23:14.834 --> 23:17.792
no longer the answer.

23:17.792 --> 23:22.291
Isn't the most important thing

23:17.792 --> 23:22.291
the hostages' lives?

23:22.291 --> 23:24.166
And you agree

23:22.291 --> 23:24.166
with that, too, Riker?

23:24.166 --> 23:25.166
I do, sir.

23:25.166 --> 23:26.917
Good, 'cause I plan

23:26.917 --> 23:29.000
to personally lead

23:26.917 --> 23:29.000
the away team

23:29.000 --> 23:32.875
on an armed rescue mission

23:29.000 --> 23:32.875
to get them out of there.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.667
Commander Data

23:39.667 --> 23:42.709
bring up the plans I requested

23:39.667 --> 23:42.709
on the viewscreen, please.

23:42.709 --> 23:43.750
Aye, sir.

23:43.750 --> 23:45.667
Most of Mordan's

23:43.750 --> 23:45.667
principal city

23:45.667 --> 23:48.208
was devastated

23:45.667 --> 23:48.208
during the war.

23:48.208 --> 23:50.166
What was left

23:48.208 --> 23:50.166
consisted largely

23:50.166 --> 23:52.291
of a network

23:50.166 --> 23:52.291
of underground tunnels--

23:52.291 --> 23:54.000
a rat's maze.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.291
When they rebuilt the city

23:56.291 --> 23:59.041
they simply built over

23:56.291 --> 23:59.041
the existing tunnels.

23:59.041 --> 24:00.625
I have it, sir.

24:05.792 --> 24:08.291
Pardon me, sir

24:05.792 --> 24:08.291
but where do these tunnels

24:08.291 --> 24:09.625
come into the picture?

24:09.625 --> 24:12.000
This is where Karnas

24:09.625 --> 24:12.000
held his hostages before

24:12.000 --> 24:15.417
and where I believe

24:12.000 --> 24:15.417
he has them now.

24:15.417 --> 24:17.375
Wouldn't that be

24:15.417 --> 24:17.375
a little obvious, Admiral?

24:17.375 --> 24:20.291
Karnas is a dogged

24:17.375 --> 24:20.291
strategist, Picard--

24:20.291 --> 24:21.583
not a brilliant one.

24:21.583 --> 24:23.250
He sticks to what works.

24:23.250 --> 24:25.166
He will kill the hostages

24:25.166 --> 24:27.542
if we do not get

24:25.166 --> 24:27.542
them out of there.

24:27.542 --> 24:29.667
Therefore you see

24:27.542 --> 24:29.667
this armed raid

24:29.667 --> 24:30.959
as the only option?

24:30.959 --> 24:32.709
You don't agree?

24:32.709 --> 24:34.667
With respect, Admiral,

24:32.709 --> 24:34.667
I would point out

24:34.667 --> 24:37.458
that no one else has heard

24:34.667 --> 24:37.458
or considered Karnas's demands.

24:37.458 --> 24:39.667
The Federation might

24:37.458 --> 24:39.667
view them differently

24:39.667 --> 24:41.583
if they knew what they were.

24:41.583 --> 24:46.875
Starfleet has given

24:41.583 --> 24:46.875
me command of the

24:41.583 --> 24:46.875
away team, Picard

24:46.875 --> 24:50.792
and I intend to use

24:46.875 --> 24:50.792
them as I see fit.

24:54.125 --> 24:58.125
Our anniversary is next week--

24:54.125 --> 24:58.125
our 50th.

24:58.125 --> 25:02.166
In his heart, he's still

24:58.125 --> 25:02.166
the same man you married, Anne.

25:02.166 --> 25:03.500
That's true.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.375
He still

25:03.500 --> 25:05.375
cares for you

25:05.375 --> 25:07.917
despite the physical changes

25:05.375 --> 25:07.917
he's undergoing.

25:07.917 --> 25:10.208
But he's getting younger

25:10.208 --> 25:14.333
and I'm...

25:10.208 --> 25:14.333
well, look at me.

25:14.333 --> 25:16.917
Why did he do this?

25:16.917 --> 25:20.125
Because there are lives

25:16.917 --> 25:20.125
at stake, Mrs. Jameson.

25:20.125 --> 25:21.959
Well, what about our lives?

25:21.959 --> 25:23.625
His and mine.

25:23.625 --> 25:27.333
I was looking forward

25:23.625 --> 25:27.333
to time together finally.

25:27.333 --> 25:28.750
Our retirement.

25:28.750 --> 25:31.625
Now he's

25:28.750 --> 25:31.625
young again

25:31.625 --> 25:34.000
and has his life to live over.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.291
Doctor, she has to know.

25:38.291 --> 25:40.375
Know what?

25:42.792 --> 25:46.750
Anne, your husband...

25:46.750 --> 25:48.208
What is it?

25:48.208 --> 25:50.333
He's not stabilizing.

25:50.333 --> 25:53.709
He may not have that life

25:50.333 --> 25:53.709
to live over.

26:13.875 --> 26:17.041
We'll be at Mordan

26:13.875 --> 26:17.041
in three hours.

26:19.792 --> 26:23.041
I couldn't sleep, either.

26:23.041 --> 26:26.333
I never could

26:23.041 --> 26:26.333
before a mission.

26:26.333 --> 26:29.041
Always wound up

26:26.333 --> 26:29.041
in the observation lounge

26:29.041 --> 26:32.083
staring out at the stars,

26:29.041 --> 26:32.083
thinking.

26:32.083 --> 26:36.041
Perhaps in this case,

26:32.083 --> 26:36.041
rethinking?

26:47.792 --> 26:50.500
Why is this mission

26:47.792 --> 26:50.500
so important to you?

26:50.500 --> 26:53.458
Why did you risk your life

26:50.500 --> 26:53.458
to lead it personally?

26:53.458 --> 26:56.166
I want to save lives, Captain.

26:56.166 --> 26:58.166
Noble sentiments...

26:58.166 --> 27:00.000
but that's too easy an answer.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.667
You've been here before.

27:01.667 --> 27:05.291
You negotiated a release of the

27:01.667 --> 27:05.291
hostages with Karnas before.

27:05.291 --> 27:09.625
Why is it now your answer

27:05.291 --> 27:09.625
is an armed raid?

27:09.625 --> 27:13.291
It's my away team

27:09.625 --> 27:13.291
you're sending in there.

27:13.291 --> 27:15.125
I think there's something

27:13.291 --> 27:15.125
you're not telling me

27:15.125 --> 27:17.250
and I have a right

27:15.125 --> 27:17.250
to know what it is.

27:18.709 --> 27:21.583
Do you know the background?

27:23.250 --> 27:25.500
The Mordanites had

27:23.250 --> 27:25.500
some sophistication

27:25.500 --> 27:29.500
but were still ruled

27:25.500 --> 27:29.500
by family tribal units.

27:29.500 --> 27:34.792
Karnas's father was

27:29.500 --> 27:34.792
the ruling chief

27:34.792 --> 27:36.000
of one of the families.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.417
Another tribe had him

27:36.000 --> 27:39.417
assassinated.

27:39.417 --> 27:42.625
Karnas seized the passengers

27:39.417 --> 27:42.625
of a starliner

27:42.625 --> 27:44.166
and held them hostage

27:44.166 --> 27:47.125
demanding that Starfleet

27:44.166 --> 27:47.125
provide him with weapons

27:47.125 --> 27:49.458
that would enable him

27:47.125 --> 27:49.458
to defeat his rivals.

27:49.458 --> 27:52.625
That's the official record.

27:52.625 --> 27:57.041
<i>Officially</i> the story is

27:57.041 --> 28:02.375
that after two other

27:57.041 --> 28:02.375
mediators were murdered...

28:02.375 --> 28:04.125
I went in

28:04.125 --> 28:06.333
and negotiated

28:04.125 --> 28:06.333
with Karnas

28:06.333 --> 28:08.959
to bring out the

28:06.333 --> 28:08.959
hostages safely.

28:08.959 --> 28:11.542
Are you saying

28:08.959 --> 28:11.542
that's not the truth?

28:11.542 --> 28:17.709
It wasn't my golden oratory

28:11.542 --> 28:17.709
that saved them, Captain.

28:19.208 --> 28:22.417
I gave Karnas the weapons

28:19.208 --> 28:22.417
he wanted.

28:23.875 --> 28:25.875
You did what?

28:25.875 --> 28:28.792
I gave exactly the same weapons

28:25.875 --> 28:28.792
to his rivals.

28:28.792 --> 28:31.375
My interpretation

28:28.792 --> 28:31.375
of the prime directive:

28:31.375 --> 28:32.875
Let them solve

28:31.375 --> 28:32.875
their problems

28:32.875 --> 28:35.709
with those arms

28:32.875 --> 28:35.709
on an equal basis.

28:39.500 --> 28:44.583
And that decision plunged them

28:39.500 --> 28:44.583
into 40 years of civil war.

28:44.583 --> 28:45.959
I didn't know that would happen.

28:45.959 --> 28:48.083
I thought a minor war...

28:48.083 --> 28:49.709
It would be settled

28:48.083 --> 28:49.709
in less than a year.

28:49.709 --> 28:52.959
How would I know

28:49.709 --> 28:52.959
it would take four decades?

28:52.959 --> 28:56.750
But I...

28:56.750 --> 28:59.583
I falsified the records

28:56.750 --> 28:59.583
to Starfleet.

28:59.583 --> 29:03.500
But I lived with that

28:59.583 --> 29:03.500
on my soul, Picard.

29:03.500 --> 29:06.834
63 people came away safe,

29:03.500 --> 29:06.834
but millions died on Mordan

29:06.834 --> 29:09.417
because I delivered

29:06.834 --> 29:09.417
those weapons.

29:09.417 --> 29:12.917
Karnas could have worked

29:09.417 --> 29:12.917
for peace

29:12.917 --> 29:15.291
during those years

29:12.917 --> 29:15.291
instead of continuing the war.

29:15.291 --> 29:17.208
It's not all on your head,

29:15.291 --> 29:17.208
Admiral.

29:17.208 --> 29:18.250
But I started it.

29:18.250 --> 29:19.792
I lit the match.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.959
Now, finally,

29:19.792 --> 29:21.959
I can vindicate myself

29:21.959 --> 29:23.792
if only in a small way.

29:23.792 --> 29:26.417
I came to negotiate

29:26.417 --> 29:29.083
but that isn't

29:26.417 --> 29:29.083
what Karnas wants.

29:29.083 --> 29:31.375
Revenge.

29:31.375 --> 29:32.875
That's why he demanded you

29:32.875 --> 29:34.917
when he knew that you

29:32.875 --> 29:34.917
were still alive.

29:34.917 --> 29:37.792
And I'm not going

29:34.917 --> 29:37.792
to give it to him, Picard.

29:37.792 --> 29:41.000
I'm going to do

29:37.792 --> 29:41.000
what I should have

29:37.792 --> 29:41.000
done the first time.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.959
We're taking the hostages

29:41.000 --> 29:43.959
out by force if necessary.

29:43.959 --> 29:46.333
No deals.

29:52.667 --> 29:54.792
Prepare to

29:52.667 --> 29:54.792
energize, chief.

29:54.792 --> 29:56.291
Belay that.

29:56.291 --> 29:58.959
Admiral, your proper

29:56.291 --> 29:58.959
place is on the Bridge.

29:58.959 --> 30:02.083
I will remind you

29:58.959 --> 30:02.083
one more time, Picard--

30:02.083 --> 30:04.125
I am the Senior

30:02.083 --> 30:04.125
Mission Commander

30:04.125 --> 30:06.208
and I am leading this team.

30:06.208 --> 30:08.667
Sir?

30:08.667 --> 30:10.542
The Admiral is correct,

30:08.667 --> 30:10.542
Number One.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.417
He has that right

30:12.417 --> 30:14.709
but I am the Captain

30:12.417 --> 30:14.709
of this ship

30:14.709 --> 30:17.709
and I have a right

30:14.709 --> 30:17.709
to accompany him.

30:21.542 --> 30:23.834
Riker, you're in command

30:21.542 --> 30:23.834
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

30:23.834 --> 30:25.291
Energize.

30:52.333 --> 30:54.083
Yes, perfect.

30:54.083 --> 30:55.500
We are in the M-4 tunnel

30:55.500 --> 30:57.917
directly under

30:55.500 --> 30:57.917
the governor's residence.

30:57.917 --> 30:59.625
M-4 is a subsidiary tunnel

30:59.625 --> 31:02.250
but it crosses and links

30:59.625 --> 31:02.250
with several main ones.

31:02.250 --> 31:03.792
I am sorry, sir.

31:03.792 --> 31:05.375
That does not correspond

31:03.792 --> 31:05.375
with the information

31:05.375 --> 31:06.583
in my tricorder.

31:06.583 --> 31:08.500
Your information

31:06.583 --> 31:08.500
is incorrect, Commander.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.000
I know these tunnels

31:08.500 --> 31:11.000
like the back of my own hand.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.166
Keep scanning for signs

31:11.000 --> 31:13.166
of human life-forms.

31:13.166 --> 31:16.125
Karnas held the hostages

31:13.166 --> 31:16.125
in these tunnels before.

31:16.125 --> 31:17.291
He'll do it again.

31:27.542 --> 31:29.917
Captain.

31:29.917 --> 31:32.417
The Admiral is

31:29.917 --> 31:32.417
definitely incorrect.

31:32.417 --> 31:33.917
The tunnel schematics we have

31:33.917 --> 31:35.500
show this to be

31:33.917 --> 31:35.500
a dead end.

31:35.500 --> 31:36.917
It was sealed off

31:35.500 --> 31:36.917
two years ago.

31:36.917 --> 31:38.583
I have no doubt you're

31:36.917 --> 31:38.583
right, Mr. Data.

31:38.583 --> 31:40.083
However, 45 years ago

31:40.083 --> 31:41.875
I'm sure it linked in

31:40.083 --> 31:41.875
with the tunnels

31:41.875 --> 31:43.709
the Admiral

31:41.875 --> 31:43.709
remembers.

31:51.375 --> 31:53.166
Damn!

31:54.125 --> 31:55.333
Geordi?

31:55.333 --> 31:58.875
This is... steelplast, sir.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.500
Fairly recent

31:58.875 --> 32:00.500
installation.

32:00.500 --> 32:01.917
This is the most

32:00.500 --> 32:01.917
direct route.

32:01.917 --> 32:04.250
Set phasers

32:01.917 --> 32:04.250
to cut through it.

32:04.250 --> 32:06.458
(<i> phasers beeping</i> )

32:23.917 --> 32:26.375
(<i> clanking</i> )

32:29.208 --> 32:30.792
If you have

32:29.208 --> 32:30.792
the coordinates

32:30.792 --> 32:32.333
where you think

32:30.792 --> 32:32.333
the hostages are, sir

32:32.333 --> 32:33.709
we could just

32:32.333 --> 32:33.709
beam in over there.

32:33.709 --> 32:36.750
Karnas may not have them

32:33.709 --> 32:36.750
in the same place.

32:36.750 --> 32:38.458
There's no substitute,

32:36.750 --> 32:38.458
Lieutenant

32:38.458 --> 32:41.083
for a little personal

32:38.458 --> 32:41.083
reconnoiter.

32:52.709 --> 32:56.083
Admiral, there's an

32:52.709 --> 32:56.083
infrared light signal up ahead--

32:56.083 --> 32:57.166
steady beam,

32:56.083 --> 32:57.166
straight across

32:57.166 --> 32:58.500
the tunnel,

32:57.166 --> 32:58.500
chest high.

32:58.500 --> 33:00.667
There's another one

32:58.500 --> 33:00.667
at... about waist level.

33:00.667 --> 33:02.291
An alarm trigger or...?

33:02.291 --> 33:03.625
Reset phasers to stun.

33:03.625 --> 33:04.750
(<i> beeping</i> )

33:04.750 --> 33:05.834
PICARD:

33:04.750 --> 33:05.834
Take cover!

33:08.792 --> 33:10.500
(<i> phaser fire</i> )

33:16.458 --> 33:17.792
Sir, look out!

33:29.458 --> 33:30.458
Their phasers, sir.

33:30.458 --> 33:31.417
Set on kill.

33:31.417 --> 33:32.500
Thank you, Mr. Data.

33:32.500 --> 33:34.458
I have heard the sound before.

33:37.333 --> 33:39.709
(<i> groaning</i> )

33:44.750 --> 33:46.709
(<i> groaning</i> )

33:49.959 --> 33:51.792
(<i> groaning</i> )

33:51.792 --> 33:52.792
YAR:

33:51.792 --> 33:52.792
Is he hit?

33:52.792 --> 33:54.458
No sign

33:52.792 --> 33:54.458
of a wound.

33:56.667 --> 33:59.083
<i>Enterprise,</i>

33:56.667 --> 33:59.083
this is Picard.

33:59.083 --> 34:00.125
Six to beam up, now!

34:15.667 --> 34:17.417
The Admiral?

34:15.667 --> 34:17.417
Sick Bay.

34:17.417 --> 34:20.250
"Not good" is a

34:17.417 --> 34:20.250
galactic understatement.

34:20.250 --> 34:22.166
Sir? Karnas again.

34:22.166 --> 34:23.917
On screen.

34:23.917 --> 34:27.125
<i>Enterprise,</i> there has been

34:23.917 --> 34:27.125
an armed intrusion

34:27.125 --> 34:28.959
in the tunnels beneath the city.

34:28.959 --> 34:31.083
Now, that smells of Jameson.

34:31.083 --> 34:33.875
Where is he?

34:33.875 --> 34:35.959
Karnas, this

34:33.875 --> 34:35.959
is Picard.

34:35.959 --> 34:37.291
I'm sorry

34:35.959 --> 34:37.291
to inform you

34:37.291 --> 34:39.291
the Admiral is

34:37.291 --> 34:39.291
critically ill.

34:39.291 --> 34:42.041
That is not my concern.

34:42.041 --> 34:43.875
Sick or well

34:43.875 --> 34:46.250
you have ten minutes

34:43.875 --> 34:46.250
to beam him down.

34:46.250 --> 34:47.542
(<i> communications beep</i> )

34:47.542 --> 34:49.083
TROI:

34:47.542 --> 34:49.083
Sick Bay to Bridge.

34:49.083 --> 34:50.458
Picard.

34:50.458 --> 34:52.208
Dr. Crusher requests

34:50.458 --> 34:52.208
your presence

34:52.208 --> 34:53.834
in Sick Bay immediately, sir.

34:53.834 --> 34:55.709
I'm on my way.

34:59.291 --> 35:01.041
Sick Bay.

35:03.291 --> 35:05.375
What is it, Doctor?

35:05.375 --> 35:08.291
I think you better see

35:05.375 --> 35:08.291
for yourself, Captain.

35:16.834 --> 35:18.417
Picard.

35:21.625 --> 35:23.500
Picard, I have to get to Karnas.

35:23.500 --> 35:25.875
I can't let him out

35:23.500 --> 35:25.875
of my care, Captain.

35:25.875 --> 35:27.625
It's my last option.

35:27.625 --> 35:28.917
The raid failed.

35:28.917 --> 35:31.375
All I have left to bargain with

35:28.917 --> 35:31.375
is myself.

35:31.375 --> 35:33.500
RIKER:

35:31.375 --> 35:33.500
Bridge to Picard.

35:33.500 --> 35:34.667
Picard here.

35:34.667 --> 35:36.583
A new message from Karnas, sir.

35:36.583 --> 35:38.417
If we don't deliver Jameson

35:36.583 --> 35:38.417
in five minutes

35:38.417 --> 35:40.458
one of the hostages

35:38.417 --> 35:40.458
will be executed.

35:40.458 --> 35:43.750
15 minutes after that,

35:40.458 --> 35:43.750
another.

35:43.750 --> 35:46.208
He promises

35:43.750 --> 35:46.208
the method of execution

35:46.208 --> 35:48.208
will be most painful.

35:48.208 --> 35:50.208
Let me go.

35:50.208 --> 35:53.792
If I give myself over to him,

35:50.208 --> 35:53.792
he'll let the hostages go.

35:53.792 --> 35:56.041
It's me he wants.

35:56.041 --> 35:58.291
It means almost

35:56.041 --> 35:58.291
certain death for you, Admiral.

35:58.291 --> 36:02.667
My life for

35:58.291 --> 36:02.667
how many hostages, Picard? 20?

36:02.667 --> 36:05.625
Let me go.

36:12.834 --> 36:14.250
Number One, inform Karnas

36:14.250 --> 36:16.458
we'll be beaming down

36:14.250 --> 36:16.458
in less than five minutes.

36:16.458 --> 36:18.458
Did you say "we," sir?

36:18.458 --> 36:20.667
You have your orders,

36:18.458 --> 36:20.667
Number One.

36:20.667 --> 36:23.291
Aye, sir.

36:34.625 --> 36:36.834
Who are you?

36:36.834 --> 36:39.041
I want Jameson.

36:39.041 --> 36:44.834
Karnas, this<i> is</i>

36:39.041 --> 36:44.834
Admiral Mark Jameson.

36:52.792 --> 36:55.875
This... charade...

36:55.875 --> 36:58.542
will accomplish

36:55.875 --> 36:58.542
nothing, Picard.

36:58.542 --> 37:02.500
Beam down Jameson and the

36:58.542 --> 37:02.500
hostages will be freed.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.875
Continue this

37:02.500 --> 37:04.875
and I promise you

37:04.875 --> 37:06.792
they will die,

37:04.875 --> 37:06.792
and you with them.

37:06.792 --> 37:10.542
Peritor Karnas, you always

37:06.792 --> 37:10.542
were a stubborn man.

37:10.542 --> 37:12.667
I thought you wanted me.

37:12.667 --> 37:14.125
I'm here.

37:14.125 --> 37:16.208
Release the hostages now.

37:16.208 --> 37:18.667
Peritor was my old title.

37:18.667 --> 37:20.834
Why do you call me that?

37:20.834 --> 37:22.792
I warn you, Picard.

37:22.792 --> 37:24.750
This trick is

37:22.792 --> 37:24.750
going on too far.

37:24.750 --> 37:26.417
He has been

37:24.750 --> 37:26.417
coached for some...

37:26.417 --> 37:28.709
some devious reason.

37:28.709 --> 37:31.875
If this farce does

37:28.709 --> 37:31.875
not stop immediately

37:31.875 --> 37:35.166
you and the hostages

37:31.875 --> 37:35.166
will be put to death!

37:35.166 --> 37:36.500
(<i> groans</i> )

37:36.500 --> 37:37.417
Doctor!

37:37.417 --> 37:39.125
(<i> yelling</i> )

37:41.375 --> 37:43.834
I am waiting for an

37:41.375 --> 37:43.834
explanation, Captain.

37:43.834 --> 37:45.875
He is the Admiral, Karnas!

37:45.875 --> 37:48.083
Before we left on this mission,

37:45.875 --> 37:48.083
he administered an overdose

37:48.083 --> 37:50.792
of an alien de-aging

37:48.083 --> 37:50.792
drug to himself. He...

37:50.792 --> 37:52.250
he wanted to face you

37:52.250 --> 37:55.000
with strength again

37:52.250 --> 37:55.000
on even terms.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.083
This is what the drug

37:55.000 --> 37:57.083
has done to him.

37:57.083 --> 38:00.333
This story you are telling

37:57.083 --> 38:00.333
me is unbelievable.

38:00.333 --> 38:05.250
Jameson is a man of more

38:00.333 --> 38:05.250
than 80 years, not this!

38:05.250 --> 38:08.792
I want that old man, Picard.

38:08.792 --> 38:12.583
I want to show him this world

38:08.792 --> 38:12.583
he helped to make

38:12.583 --> 38:15.417
the scars

38:12.583 --> 38:15.417
on old soldiers' bodies

38:15.417 --> 38:18.458
the graveyards

38:15.417 --> 38:18.458
of our young dead

38:18.458 --> 38:21.875
the wasted cities that we are

38:18.458 --> 38:21.875
still rebuilding.

38:21.875 --> 38:23.500
(<i> groaning</i> )

38:23.500 --> 38:27.417
And all of it

38:23.500 --> 38:27.417
caused by him.

38:27.417 --> 38:28.792
As I understand it, Karnas

38:28.792 --> 38:30.667
it was you

38:28.792 --> 38:30.667
who demanded the weapons

38:30.667 --> 38:32.417
to avenge your

38:30.667 --> 38:32.417
father's death.

38:32.417 --> 38:36.000
But Jameson didn't give

38:32.417 --> 38:36.000
weapons to only us.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.417
If he had, we would have quickly

38:36.000 --> 38:39.417
triumphed over our enemies

38:39.417 --> 38:42.291
and there would

38:39.417 --> 38:42.291
have been peace in

38:39.417 --> 38:42.291
all these decades.

38:42.291 --> 38:46.667
I want him to pay for that,

38:42.291 --> 38:46.667
Picard.

38:46.667 --> 38:48.125
(<i> Jameson groans loudly</i> )

38:48.125 --> 38:50.709
Captain, I think Mrs. Jameson

38:50.709 --> 38:52.041
should beam down now.

38:52.041 --> 38:53.917
<i>Enterprise,</i> this is Picard.

38:53.917 --> 38:56.375
Have Mrs. Jameson prepare

38:53.917 --> 38:56.375
to beam down.

38:56.375 --> 38:58.709
Karnas, I asked Dr. Crusher

38:56.375 --> 38:58.709
to bring with her

38:58.709 --> 39:01.500
the visual records we made

38:58.709 --> 39:01.500
of the Admiral's deterioration.

39:01.500 --> 39:02.542
Will you look at them?

39:02.542 --> 39:04.375
You're wasting my time, Picard.

39:04.375 --> 39:06.333
Just a few moments.

39:06.333 --> 39:08.792
You saw the Admiral

39:06.333 --> 39:08.792
on the<i> Enterprise</i>

39:08.792 --> 39:10.250
when he was en route

39:08.792 --> 39:10.250
for Mordan?

39:08.792 --> 39:10.250
Yes.

39:10.250 --> 39:11.750
And you recognized him?

39:10.250 --> 39:11.750
Yes.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.792
Is this the man

39:11.750 --> 39:13.792
you saw?

39:13.792 --> 39:16.625
This is the man I want.

39:16.625 --> 39:17.792
He's here, Karnas.

39:17.792 --> 39:18.834
Look.

39:32.041 --> 39:35.375
Once he took the compound,

39:32.041 --> 39:35.375
there was no way to stop it.

39:43.750 --> 39:46.000
(<i> gasping</i> )

39:53.792 --> 39:56.291
You'll have to deal

39:53.792 --> 39:56.291
with me, Karnas.

39:56.291 --> 39:59.291
Whatever you wanted from Jameson

39:56.291 --> 39:59.291
isn't possible anymore

39:59.291 --> 40:01.041
and you wanted revenge.

40:01.041 --> 40:03.208
You blamed your war on him

40:03.208 --> 40:05.625
and there's no doubt he had

40:03.208 --> 40:05.625
a lot to do with it

40:05.625 --> 40:08.500
but you had the weapons

40:05.625 --> 40:08.500
and you used them.

40:08.500 --> 40:10.208
You could have tried

40:08.500 --> 40:10.208
for negotiations

40:10.208 --> 40:12.792
for peace on your planet

40:10.208 --> 40:12.792
long ago.

40:12.792 --> 40:14.500
Instead, you chose to fight.

40:14.500 --> 40:16.750
How many of those 40 years

40:14.500 --> 40:16.750
of civil war

40:16.750 --> 40:18.208
are on your head, Karnas?

40:18.208 --> 40:19.875
Jameson must pay

40:18.208 --> 40:19.875
for his crimes.

40:19.875 --> 40:21.834
I have sworn it

40:19.875 --> 40:21.834
to my people.

40:21.834 --> 40:24.125
45 years ago he made

40:21.834 --> 40:24.125
the wrong decision.

40:24.125 --> 40:27.375
He wanted to come back,

40:24.125 --> 40:27.375
to somehow right it

40:27.375 --> 40:31.041
to atone for

40:27.375 --> 40:31.041
what he did.

40:31.041 --> 40:36.208
Now, all he can do is

40:31.041 --> 40:36.208
give himself up to you.

40:36.208 --> 40:38.417
He brought this retribution

40:36.208 --> 40:38.417
on himself.

40:38.417 --> 40:39.750
No!

40:39.750 --> 40:41.000
I don't believe you.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.125
You're shielding Jameson

40:41.000 --> 40:42.125
on the ship

40:42.125 --> 40:43.500
and you're telling me this tale

40:43.500 --> 40:45.709
to save his life.

40:45.709 --> 40:48.291
Peritor Karnas...

40:48.291 --> 40:52.041
There were only two of us

40:48.291 --> 40:52.041
in the meeting.

40:52.041 --> 40:55.083
You didn't even trust

40:52.041 --> 40:55.083
your lieutenants there.

40:55.083 --> 40:59.208
You told me that

40:55.083 --> 40:59.208
old Peritor Sane

40:59.208 --> 41:01.959
had ordered your father's

40:59.208 --> 41:01.959
assassination.

41:01.959 --> 41:06.000
You told me that you wanted arms

41:01.959 --> 41:06.000
to destroy him.

41:06.000 --> 41:10.208
Peace... wasn't on your mind.

41:10.208 --> 41:13.000
All you wanted was revenge

41:13.000 --> 41:16.250
and I gave you the weapons

41:13.000 --> 41:16.250
to do it.

41:16.250 --> 41:20.792
Jameson told you this.

41:20.792 --> 41:23.000
If it is you...

41:23.000 --> 41:24.709
show me the scar.

41:24.709 --> 41:27.083
There!

41:27.083 --> 41:31.542
The blood cut you gave me

41:27.083 --> 41:31.542
to seal our bargain!

41:34.667 --> 41:37.917
It is you.

41:37.917 --> 41:43.291
Somehow... it is you.

41:44.333 --> 41:47.667
(<i> gasping</i> )

41:50.166 --> 41:53.333
Then die by your own weapon!

41:57.750 --> 41:59.834
No.

41:59.834 --> 42:04.500
No, my revenge will be

41:59.834 --> 42:04.500
in seeing you live like this.

42:06.792 --> 42:09.583
(<i> groans</i> )

42:12.333 --> 42:14.458
Such pain.

42:14.458 --> 42:17.208
The compound he took

42:14.458 --> 42:17.208
is forcing his cells and organs

42:17.208 --> 42:19.750
to go further, younger,

42:17.208 --> 42:19.750
and they can't take the stress.

42:19.750 --> 42:21.834
It's like they're imploding.

42:21.834 --> 42:23.959
And I can't give him

42:21.834 --> 42:23.959
anything to stop it.

42:23.959 --> 42:26.041
Can you ease

42:23.959 --> 42:26.041
the pain?

42:27.917 --> 42:29.083
Mark...

42:29.083 --> 42:31.667
can you hear me?

42:31.667 --> 42:33.583
Yes.

42:33.583 --> 42:36.875
I will always love you.

42:36.875 --> 42:41.333
Annie, with the golden hair.

42:41.333 --> 42:45.041
Flatterer.

42:45.041 --> 42:47.125
It's gray now.

42:50.792 --> 42:54.166
I see only the gold.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.875
(<i> groans</i> )

43:01.792 --> 43:05.041
(<i> crying</i> )

43:11.792 --> 43:15.458
Rest, Jameson.

43:15.458 --> 43:20.500
Your long night... and mine...

43:20.500 --> 43:23.000
are over.

43:25.417 --> 43:30.875
The hostages will be freed

43:25.417 --> 43:30.875
immediately, Captain.

43:30.875 --> 43:35.500
I'm prepared

43:30.875 --> 43:35.500
to be cooperative.

43:44.333 --> 43:47.834
The hostages have been freed

43:44.333 --> 43:47.834
by Karnas unharmed

43:47.834 --> 43:50.625
and the body

43:47.834 --> 43:50.625
of Admiral Mark Jameson

43:50.625 --> 43:54.000
has been buried on Mordan

43:50.625 --> 43:54.000
at the request of his widow

43:54.000 --> 43:56.291
and by the permission

43:54.000 --> 43:56.291
of Karnas.

43:58.125 --> 44:01.041
The quest for youth,

43:58.125 --> 44:01.041
Number One.

44:01.041 --> 44:03.250
So futile.

44:03.250 --> 44:06.458
Age and wisdom have

44:03.250 --> 44:06.458
their graces, too.

44:06.458 --> 44:10.250
I wonder if one doesn't

44:06.458 --> 44:10.250
have to have age and wisdom

44:10.250 --> 44:11.792
to appreciate that, sir.

44:11.792 --> 44:15.792
I hope not, Number One.

44:15.792 --> 44:18.291
Mr. La Forge, prepare

44:15.792 --> 44:18.291
to take us out of orbit.

44:18.291 --> 44:20.667
Set course for Isis III.

44:20.667 --> 44:22.208
Aye, sir.

44:22.208 --> 44:24.291
Leaving orbit.
