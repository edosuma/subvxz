All right, here we go.

[Oliver] I fear no humans, Zarginda.

01:35.345 --> 01:38.264
It's for these reasons I've been chosen
to lead this mission.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.516
It's my calling.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.392
But why you?

01:42.435 --> 01:43.937
Why must you leave me?

Please don't leave me.

You asshole!

01:59.536 --> 02:01.496
You're going to New York without me,
aren't you?

02:01.579 --> 02:03.873
You're gonna ditch me after you graduate.
I know it.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.125
[Oliver] Jesus Christ!

02:05.458 --> 02:09.629
What is your problem? Can you try
to act professional in front of the crew?

02:09.712 --> 02:12.382
-Suck a dick, Oliver!
-Emaline.

02:13.007 --> 02:14.425

Pookey! Little bear. Butterball.

-Don't touch me!

02:20.557 --> 02:22.559
-[Emaline] Leave me alone!
-Amazing.

02:22.642 --> 02:23.893
-We got it.
-[Oliver] I'm sorry.

02:33.194 --> 02:35.738
Dude, you ask her yet?

02:36.406 --> 02:37.532
Just about to.

02:37.615 --> 02:39.617
Nice. Chicks love romantic overtures.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.870
[Luke] Yeah. For shizzle.

02:42.787 --> 02:44.289
Okay, here we go.

02:44.372 --> 02:45.623
Okay.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.632
Hey. What'cha doing right now?

02:55.008 --> 02:57.677
Oh, nothing, I guess.
Probably just gonna go home.

02:57.760 --> 03:01.890
Oh, yeah, you could do that,
or you could go see Tori Amos,

03:01.973 --> 03:04.976
live in concert tonight, with me.

03:05.768 --> 03:06.853
-What?
-Mm-hmm.

03:06.936 --> 03:08.146
Seriously?

03:08.229 --> 03:09.439
-Yeah.
-Luke!

03:09.522 --> 03:12.275
Yeah, I mean,
I just wanted to surprise you.

03:12.775 --> 03:14.527
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

Oh, my God.

03:15.653 --> 03:16.946
[chuckles]

03:20.575 --> 03:24.245
But this is in Portland.
How are we supposed to get there?

03:25.663 --> 03:26.706
[chuckles]

03:27.582 --> 03:28.833
[Kate] This is a bad idea.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.336
What if we get pulled over?
This is so illegal.

03:31.419 --> 03:35.173
Kate, we're not gonna get pulled over.
You have your learner's permit.

03:35.256 --> 03:37.967
-It's fine.
-Oh, God, we're gonna die.

03:38.051 --> 03:41.971
We're going to die in a car accident
and end up in that Driver's Ed movie.

03:42.055 --> 03:46.309
<i>-Red Asphalt.</i> You've seen that?
-When's the last time anyone drove this?

03:46.392 --> 03:49.562
Uh, before this morning, seven years ago.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.523
I mean, it's been rusting by the woodpile
since my dad left.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.570
Funny enough,
you remember that crate of tapes

03:57.654 --> 03:59.864
that you found in my garage that day?

03:59.948 --> 04:01.324
Yeah, why?

04:02.784 --> 04:07.789
[sighs] Well, it turns out they're
these videos of my dad just talking.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.918
Like this video diary type thing, I guess.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.797
It's weird, I used to hate the guy, but...

04:17.507 --> 04:20.093
now I kinda wish I knew him.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.470
He seems cool.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.765
Well, maybe it's not too late.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.559
Maybe you could write to him or something.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.961
This was really fun.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.338
Yeah, it was.

14:48.929 --> 14:51.515
Uh, yeah.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.143
When my--

14:54.518 --> 14:58.731
when Kate's mom, when she passed away,

14:59.565 --> 15:01.734
she'd been sick for a number of years.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.862
In pain for a long time.

15:06.447 --> 15:07.948
That was ten years ago.

15:09.325 --> 15:13.704
This whole time, I never thought I'd
feel a connection with anyone ever again.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.124
Till now.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.588
I know this is just fun or whatever,

15:22.671 --> 15:27.051
but I wanna thank you
for giving me a little hope.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.821
[Luke] That was amazing.
I've never seen anything like that before.

15:47.905 --> 15:51.283
Oh! When she was playing the piano,
didn't you think she was gonna smash it

15:51.367 --> 15:53.452
the way she was pounding it like that?

15:53.535 --> 15:54.870
Yeah. Totally.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.206
Oh, my gosh. I mean, she's just so cool.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.750
She reminds me so much of you, actually.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.295
Um, so did you enjoy the show?

16:03.379 --> 16:05.255
Yeah. It was the best, thank you.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.341
It was the best date ever.

16:07.967 --> 16:11.428
Except, it wasn't a date-date.

16:11.512 --> 16:12.721
It was a fake date.

16:12.805 --> 16:16.600
Yeah, I know. But, you know,
date, fake date, what's the difference?

16:16.684 --> 16:20.938
Um, the difference is that one is real,
and one isn't.

16:21.480 --> 16:26.402
So, this wasn't real.
Our relationship is not real.

16:26.485 --> 16:29.947
Yeah, but would it have been
different if it was a real date?

16:31.740 --> 16:32.866
Luke...

16:34.326 --> 16:35.995
I think we need to breakup.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.666
How can we break up
if we're not in a relationship--

16:40.749 --> 16:42.793
Jesus, Luke, stop!

16:42.876 --> 16:45.587
Whatever you think that this is,
it isn't, okay?

16:45.671 --> 16:47.339
I am what I am.

16:48.090 --> 16:51.093
And we're not a couple,
and we're not going to be, ever.

17:02.479 --> 17:03.897

I'm sorry about the car.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.135
Can you say something?

18:23.644 --> 18:29.358
Look, my whole life,
I have been the freak.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.903
The girl who nobody picked for dodgeball.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.280
The girl who didn't have a mom.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.992
The girl who dressed funny
because it was her dad buying her clothes.

18:41.328 --> 18:44.289
And then, tonight...

18:46.083 --> 18:49.461
I looked at these people, and I thought...

18:52.673 --> 18:57.970
maybe there's a future
where I don't have to be a freak.

18:59.096 --> 19:01.265
Maybe I can be who I am and that's okay.

19:02.015 --> 19:04.184
I never said you couldn't be who you are.

19:04.726 --> 19:10.357
I told you, whoever you are,
whatever you are, it doesn't matter to me.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.318
-Luke, it matters to me.
-Okay, so now what?

19:13.402 --> 19:16.446
Go and tell everyone at school
that you're a lesbian.

19:16.530 --> 19:20.617
-You don't think they'll call you a freak?
-All that matters is that I know.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.453
-You had a great time with me.
-I had an amazing time.

19:23.537 --> 19:27.666
So why can't we keep hanging out?
Having amazing nights together?

19:28.667 --> 19:30.335
Why are you doing this to me?

19:30.419 --> 19:32.296
Because it's not about you!

19:32.379 --> 19:34.548
I told you how from the beginning
how I felt,

19:34.631 --> 19:37.050
and you wouldn't hear it
because all you care about is yourself.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.052
-I like you.
-No, you don't.

19:39.136 --> 19:43.849
You like the idea of me.
You like the idea of having a girlfriend.

19:43.932 --> 19:46.643
But you're just using me
to make yourself feel better

19:46.727 --> 19:49.521
about everything in your life that sucks.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.191
So, just leave me alone.

Well, you two had yourselves
quite an adventure tonight, didn't ya?

20:15.714 --> 20:19.134
Coming out here, without the courtesy
of letting anyone know.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.763
You know, I was your age once.

20:23.388 --> 20:26.892
There's a lot of things I never did
that maybe I wish I had.

20:26.975 --> 20:29.811
Like sneaking out to a rock concert.

20:30.646 --> 20:31.730
You have a good time?

20:33.315 --> 20:34.358
Fine.

20:38.612 --> 20:39.446
Fine.
