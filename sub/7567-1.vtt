- Stop that.

The power of the trident
is just too strong for me to overcome.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.618
I bet Ursula could've done it.

more like your sister

- Your fault that we can never

show our faces in polite society again!

This is just the kind of break
in the ice we've been waiting for.

When Ariel's innocent little daughter

14:43.674 --> 14:46.393
uncovers the secret of that locket,

14:46.469 --> 14:48.767
she's going to have lots of questions.

you'd been swimming out here...

I'm sorry about Melody.

45:49.664 --> 45:50.665
Uh...

45:50.748 --> 45:53.467
I don't think I've seen you around here.
What's your name?

Move along.

Come on, Miss Popularity.

46:09.892 --> 46:12.190
We have a previous engagement.
Remember?

Maybe I'll catch you later.

47:50.242 --> 47:52.119
I just want you to know, pal,

47:52.203 --> 47:54.456
I'm sorry I said that thing
about the blubber.

47:54.580 --> 47:58.710
- Well, I'm sorry about the fish breath.
- Yeah...

47:58.834 --> 48:01.758
- You didn't say anything about that.
- But I was thinkin' it.

Ah, don't worry, Ariel. We'll find her.

49:01.689 --> 49:03.908
Daddy! The trident!

49:06.152 --> 49:08.075
But that's not possible.

49:08.154 --> 49:11.158
Nobody can remove the trident
from the stand except you, sire.

You or one of your descendants.

49:13.742 --> 49:15.039
Melody.

49:15.119 --> 49:17.918
Who I was supposed to be watching.

49:17.997 --> 49:22.548
Go ahead, crack me open.
Make a crab cake out of me, sire.

49:22.710 --> 49:24.804
But how could she have gotten here?

49:24.879 --> 49:29.726
Morgana.
If she gets her hands on my trident...

49:29.800 --> 49:31.473
Double the search parties!

49:31.552 --> 49:33.930
I want every creature
in the ocean on patrol!

49:34.054 --> 49:35.897
Yes, sire!

49:44.690 --> 49:45.737
ARIEL: Wait a minute.

49:46.692 --> 49:48.615
I know those two.

49:49.737 --> 49:51.660
It's all my fault.

49:51.739 --> 49:54.333
If I had just paid a little more attention

49:54.408 --> 49:57.753
instead of blabbering
on and on and on...

50:06.003 --> 50:08.347
...and on and on.

50:08.422 --> 50:12.598
From now on, Your Majesty,
nothing gets past

50:14.261 --> 50:15.262
me.

50:15.429 --> 50:16.476
Whoo-hoo!

50:16.555 --> 50:17.898
Yeah!

50:20.976 --> 50:22.319
We did it!

50:22.394 --> 50:23.941
Uh-huh. Uh...

50:24.021 --> 50:25.022
Hmm?

50:30.402 --> 50:34.623
All this time Atlantica was never
that far away from home.

50:35.074 --> 50:38.123
This is your home?

50:39.286 --> 50:40.412
It used to be.

50:40.621 --> 50:43.750
Whoa, what a pad.
Talk about your kerb appeal.

50:43.832 --> 50:45.129
But what's with the wall?

50:45.459 --> 50:48.258
I know good fences make good
neighbours, but isn't that a bit much?

50:48.337 --> 50:50.180
What you tryin' to keep out?

50:50.256 --> 50:52.384
It wasn't built to keep something out.

50:53.300 --> 50:55.223
It was built to keep me in.

50:55.594 --> 50:58.268
Come on. Let's go.

51:00.808 --> 51:02.731
DASH: Whoa-ho-ho!
TIP: Whoo-hoo!

51:08.107 --> 51:11.361

we make a pretty good team.

51:11.443 --> 51:15.164
DASH: Once you're a permanent
mermaid, we'll be friends forever.

51:15.239 --> 51:20.245
- We'll be inseparable.
- Nothing will ever come between us.

51:20.327 --> 51:22.750
- Shark! Run! Run!
- Shark!

51:23.622 --> 51:25.044
No, wait!

- It's just...
- (LAUGHS)

51:28.002 --> 51:30.004
Leavin' so soon, boys?

51:30.087 --> 51:32.761
What can I say?
When you got it, you got it.

51:32.840 --> 51:35.343
Hey! You got it!

51:35.426 --> 51:38.179
Sweetheart, you're my new hero.

51:38.262 --> 51:41.983
Let's go. It's time for some magic.

51:42.057 --> 51:44.526
But... But my friends...

51:44.602 --> 51:48.152
Ha! You mean you call those two
yellow-bellied sea slugs your friends?

51:49.023 --> 51:50.115
Come on!

51:50.190 --> 51:52.534
You wanna be a mermaid, or what?

51:52.610 --> 51:55.284
We got the power. We got the power.
(GRUNTING)

51:56.238 --> 51:57.660
We got the power!

52:09.960 --> 52:12.884
(GASPS) So there it is.

52:13.047 --> 52:16.768
Swim back as fast as you can and tell
my father. I'll try to find Melody.

52:16.842 --> 52:21.894
Oh, but if that old sea witch is in there,
and then there's that mean little shark,

52:21.972 --> 52:25.943
and then those manta rays come, and
then she takes those creepy tentacles

52:26.018 --> 52:28.942
so suction cups stick to your face, and...

52:29.063 --> 52:30.565
(SIGHS) Uh-uh.

52:30.648 --> 52:32.946
No way you're going in there alone.

52:33.442 --> 52:34.989
But, Flounder, if we both go,

52:35.069 --> 52:37.788
who's going to tell Daddy
where Morgana's lair is?

52:37.863 --> 52:41.242
What's all the whispering about?
Is Melody around here?

52:41.742 --> 52:44.165
- Did you find her yet? If she's...
- Scuttle!

52:44.244 --> 52:46.212
(WHISPERS) Get down and be quiet.

52:46.872 --> 52:48.419
Wait a minute.

52:48.499 --> 52:50.092
Scuttle can get help.

52:51.669 --> 52:56.345
Scuttle, I need you
to pay very close attention.

52:56.757 --> 52:59.226
We're doomed.

52:59.551 --> 53:01.849
Oh, there you are, darling!

53:01.929 --> 53:04.853
Oh, I was so worried about you.

53:04.932 --> 53:08.778
And look!
You've brought back my trident.

53:08.852 --> 53:12.072
- Clever girl.
- Give it to her! Give it to her!

53:12.940 --> 53:14.032
Hey!

53:14.108 --> 53:17.408
Forgive him, dear.
He's got a little size issue.

53:17.486 --> 53:20.831
Now, if you'll just hand over the...

53:20.906 --> 53:23.625
- Melody, don't! Don't listen to her!
- Mom!

53:26.453 --> 53:28.126
BOTH: You're a mermaid?

53:28.205 --> 53:30.924
Ariel, how nice of you to come.

53:31.375 --> 53:33.548
And you brought Flopper with you.

53:33.627 --> 53:35.254
The name's Flounder.

53:35.963 --> 53:37.010
Grrr!

53:37.089 --> 53:39.808
"Grrr" yourself, pipsqueak.

53:39.925 --> 53:41.848
Get that thing and hit me.

53:41.969 --> 53:44.392
One bite, and he's shrimp toast.

53:44.638 --> 53:47.517
Sweetheart, hand me my trident now.

53:48.434 --> 53:52.280
All this time, and you never told me?

53:52.354 --> 53:56.530
Kept the most important secret in
her whole life from her own daughter.

53:56.608 --> 53:59.111
Please, give it to me, Melody.

53:59.194 --> 54:01.413
No, hand it to me.

54:01.488 --> 54:04.583
- It's for your own good.
- She's lying!

54:04.658 --> 54:07.502
I've given you
what you've always wanted.

54:07.578 --> 54:11.128
She's the one who lied to you
all these years.

54:11.206 --> 54:14.176
- I was trying to protect you.
- By fencing me in?

54:14.501 --> 54:16.344
You knew how much I loved the sea.

54:16.587 --> 54:18.305
Why did you keep the truth from me?

54:18.380 --> 54:23.011
Melody, listen to me. If there was one
thing in my life that I could do over...

54:23.761 --> 54:25.308
Too late, Mom.

54:25.387 --> 54:26.434
Melody, no!

54:28.182 --> 54:29.525
(CACKLING)

54:34.396 --> 54:40.074
All the power of the seven seas
at my command!

54:42.696 --> 54:45.119
Hello! Can we get with the programme?

54:45.199 --> 54:47.452
It's still a small world down here!

54:49.495 --> 54:51.418
Mom!

54:51.497 --> 54:56.048
Your mommy was only trying
to protect you from <i>moi!</i>

54:56.126 --> 54:59.130
What she did, she did out of... (SNIFFS)

54:59.213 --> 55:00.556
...love.

55:01.882 --> 55:05.853
Little Melody's been a very naughty girl,

55:05.928 --> 55:09.478
stealing from her own grandfather.

55:09.681 --> 55:12.275
My grandfather?

55:12.559 --> 55:18.441
King Triton, ruler of Atlantica,
commander in chief of all of the oceans!

55:18.524 --> 55:22.495
Or at least he was,
until a certain little thief came along.

55:22.569 --> 55:23.570
You tricked me.

55:23.654 --> 55:26.407
You've got no one to blame but yourself.

55:27.658 --> 55:29.126
Tell me, Melody.

55:29.201 --> 55:32.296
Is being a mermaid
everything you dreamed?

55:32.412 --> 55:34.335
Was it worth it?

55:34.414 --> 55:35.882
(CACKLING)

55:36.416 --> 55:37.417
(GASPS)

55:37.543 --> 55:38.715
Oh!

55:38.919 --> 55:40.762
- (GROANS)
- Melody!

55:45.843 --> 55:48.346
Oh, and by the way,

55:48.428 --> 55:51.932
your time as a mermaid
has just about expired.

55:53.058 --> 55:54.355
Catch you later.

55:54.434 --> 55:57.358
I've got bigger fish to fry!

55:57.437 --> 56:00.111
Bigger fish! Now, there's an idea!

56:00.440 --> 56:01.817
(GRUNTING)

56:01.900 --> 56:03.652
We gotta keep trying.

56:05.445 --> 56:09.416
It's no use. It's too thick.

56:12.411 --> 56:14.630
(SOBBING) Oh, Flounder.

56:14.705 --> 56:17.299
I've ruined everything.

56:22.337 --> 56:25.261
We're guppies, man. Jellyfish.

56:25.340 --> 56:27.468
The great Tip and Dash.

56:27.634 --> 56:30.729
Cowards-slash-losers.

56:32.806 --> 56:35.355
Well, at least we're alive.

56:35.434 --> 56:39.029
Yeah, if you wanna call this living.

56:43.942 --> 56:45.569
Okay, on the one hand,

56:45.652 --> 56:47.825
we can live a long, healthy life,

56:47.946 --> 56:51.826
albeit as disgusting,
pathetic, cowardly...

56:52.034 --> 56:54.378
- Worms.
- That's good. Good.

56:54.453 --> 56:56.421
Cowardly worms.

56:56.496 --> 56:59.921
On the other hand, we could gather

<i>Ask them my questions
and get some answers</i>

01:11:31.579 --> 01:11:35.755
<i>What's a fire and why does it
What's the word</i>

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:37.419
<i>Burn</i>

01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:42.299
<i>When's it my turn
Wouldn't I love</i>

<i>Love to explore that shore up above</i>

01:11:48.346 --> 01:11:50.895
<i>Out of the sea</i>

01:11:52.266 --> 01:11:54.894
<i>Wish I could be</i>

01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:59.278
<i>Part of that world</i>
