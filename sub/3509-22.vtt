WEBVTT

00:02.318 --> 00:03.644
Previously on "Castle"...

00:03.645 --> 00:05.512
What the hell are you doin'?
That's my suspect.

00:05.513 --> 00:09.336
Okay, relax. We're on the same team. Royce?

00:09.430 --> 00:11.952
Hey, kid. All they ever
taught us in the academy

00:11.953 --> 00:12.865
was how to do paperwork.

00:12.866 --> 00:15.000
You were the one who
taught me how to be a cop.

00:15.001 --> 00:18.818
You were easy to impress.
No, I wasn't. I was drowning,

00:18.819 --> 00:20.979
and you were dry land.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.773
I didn't mean for it to go like this.

00:22.774 --> 00:25.080
Mike, I was in love with you.

00:25.081 --> 00:27.085
Go ahead, kid. Do what you gotta do.

00:27.086 --> 00:28.148
And when I arrest you,

00:28.149 --> 00:30.468
you're gonna realize that
what you destroyed today

00:30.469 --> 00:33.173
was worth a hell of a lot more than money.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074

01:21.018 --> 01:23.115
You should've stayed out of this, Royce.

01:23.182 --> 01:24.172
You have no idea

01:24.173 --> 01:26.637
the hell that's about to rain down on you.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.461
Scary.

01:44.302 --> 01:46.340
Where is he? Turn around and go back home

01:46.341 --> 01:47.600
and let me handle this, all right?

01:47.601 --> 01:49.730
Sir, I've seen dead bodies before.

01:57.169 --> 01:59.141
Come on, Kate. You don't want
to remember him like this.

01:59.142 --> 02:01.749
Castle, if it was me lying there,
would you just walk away?

02:08.669 --> 02:10.526
I'm so sorry, honey.

02:12.782 --> 02:14.157
So tell me what happened.

02:14.650 --> 02:16.329
He was shot in the leg.

02:16.330 --> 02:17.701
Judging from the blood trail,

02:17.702 --> 02:19.686
I'd say the bullet broke the bone.

02:20.202 --> 02:22.137
He tried to hide, but...

02:25.071 --> 02:26.814
Uh, I found this in his pocket.

02:27.870 --> 02:30.940
He just flew in from Los
Angeles this afternoon.

02:30.941 --> 02:33.144
What was he doing in L.A.?
I heard he moved there

02:33.145 --> 02:34.944
after he lost his bounty hunter's license.

02:34.945 --> 02:37.040
I guess he was trying
to make a fresh start.

02:37.041 --> 02:38.612
When was the last time you spoke to him?

02:41.869 --> 02:43.133
When I arrested him.

02:47.613 --> 02:48.990
Lanie, could I?

02:49.130 --> 02:50.234
Sure.

03:16.298 --> 03:17.865
Royce, um...

03:17.910 --> 03:19.846
Had something else in his pocket.

03:20.535 --> 03:22.005
It's addressed to you.

03:28.526 --> 03:29.790
About the case?

03:31.405 --> 03:32.749
No.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.561
Think we got the murder weapon.

03:36.297 --> 03:37.908
Found it in the garbage around the corner.

03:37.909 --> 03:39.516
Gun was definitely fired recently.

03:39.517 --> 03:41.050
Shooter took the time to empty the ammo

03:41.051 --> 03:41.906
before he dumped it.

03:41.907 --> 03:43.874
Worried we'd find
fingerprints on the bullets?

03:44.299 --> 03:46.873
This is a cheap street gun.
It's a throwaway.

03:47.814 --> 03:49.093
There's threading on the barrel.

03:49.185 --> 03:50.460
Silencer? Yeah.

03:50.461 --> 03:52.974
Allowing our killer to shoot
Royce in broad daylight.

03:54.593 --> 03:56.418
Listen, Beckett, we're gonna get this guy.

03:56.661 --> 03:58.646
We got uniforms hitting
every store and apartment

03:58.647 --> 03:59.794
in a 5-block radius.

03:59.795 --> 04:02.594
This is New York.
Somebody had to have seen something.

04:06.854 --> 04:08.064
L.A. to New York...

04:08.065 --> 04:09.769
it's like Royce was running from something,

04:09.770 --> 04:11.497
like he knew he was in danger.

04:12.123 --> 04:14.953
Yo. You were right about the silencer.

04:15.013 --> 04:17.837
The lab found trace amounts of
titanium alloy in the threads.

04:17.838 --> 04:20.428
They've narrowed it done to one
of two commercial suppressors.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.877
Both run about a grand.

04:21.878 --> 04:24.261
Why put an expensive
silencer on a cheap gun?

04:24.398 --> 04:28.305
Because our killer followed Royce from L.A.

04:28.306 --> 04:29.628
And couldn't bring his
own gun on the plane.

04:29.629 --> 04:31.485
But a silencer is just a cylinder.

04:31.486 --> 04:33.236
It could easily be hidden in a checked bag.

04:33.237 --> 04:34.436
Isolate all of the flights that someone

04:34.437 --> 04:35.609
could've followed Royce from L.A. on.

04:35.610 --> 04:37.532
There couldn't have been
that many, and specifically,

04:37.533 --> 04:38.540
focus on the people who

04:38.541 --> 04:40.701
might have bought tickets
last minute. Right.

04:43.062 --> 04:44.726
What the hell were you into, Mike?

04:44.849 --> 04:46.737
Okay, so we got five flights out of L.A.

04:46.738 --> 04:48.768
That meet our criteria.
I ran all the passengers,

04:48.769 --> 04:50.565
and one name popped.

04:50.949 --> 04:53.514
Neel McCauley bought his
ticket at the airport

04:53.515 --> 04:55.046
an hour before the flight.

04:55.047 --> 04:58.681
His identity is brand-new...
no credit history,

04:58.682 --> 05:00.520
and his driver's license number is a fake.

05:00.521 --> 05:02.953
Neel McCauley, really? Why?

05:03.125 --> 05:05.382
That's Robert de Niro's
character in "heat."

05:06.519 --> 05:07.474
That's our guy.

05:07.475 --> 05:10.086
Well, if it is, you're gonna
need to get on a plane,

05:10.087 --> 05:11.857
'cause Mr. McCauley flew back to L.A.

05:11.858 --> 05:13.473
Two hours after Royce was shot.

05:14.116 --> 05:16.695
I'm not sending you to L.A.
You have no solid evidence

05:16.696 --> 05:18.496
linking Neel McCauley to this murder.

05:18.497 --> 05:20.573
He came to New York for six hours.

05:20.574 --> 05:22.047
Who flies in for that short a stay?

05:22.048 --> 05:23.350
Businessmen do it all the time.

05:23.351 --> 05:26.007
Businessmen don't use false I.
D.S... Or pack a silencer.

05:26.008 --> 05:27.713
That's supposition.
I need a lot more than that

05:27.714 --> 05:29.849
to justify flying a detective
across the country.

05:29.850 --> 05:32.085
You and I both know that the longer I wait

05:32.086 --> 05:35.095
to go out there, the colder
this trail gets. Take a day,

05:35.096 --> 05:37.297
shore this up, and if there's
sufficient evidence,

05:37.298 --> 05:39.845
I'll contact L.A.P.D.
You'll contact the L.A.P.D.?

05:39.846 --> 05:42.909
This is my case.
This happened in our jurisdiction.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.157
You think the L.A.P.D.
Is gonna lift a finger...

05:45.158 --> 05:47.994
Kate, you're too close to this.
No, sir, I am committed.

05:47.995 --> 05:49.453
I am not compromised.

05:49.454 --> 05:50.976
You're torn up!

05:55.450 --> 05:59.977
Kate, things between you
and Royce ended badly.

05:59.978 --> 06:03.177
I get it, but that emotion is exactly why

06:03.178 --> 06:05.452
I need to assign this to someone else.

06:09.976 --> 06:11.220
You know what? You're right.

06:12.903 --> 06:14.694
I am too close to this.

06:17.662 --> 06:19.316
I have some vacation days coming up.

06:19.317 --> 06:21.045
I think now would be a good time.

06:21.977 --> 06:23.082
Kate.

06:25.542 --> 06:27.768
I hope you're not thinking about
doing something reckless.

06:28.886 --> 06:30.071
No, sir.

06:40.344 --> 06:41.256
Where you going?

06:41.257 --> 06:42.804
Home. The hell you are.

06:42.805 --> 06:45.384
Castle... please.

06:45.385 --> 06:47.914
He was mtraining officer, my friend.

06:48.518 --> 06:50.918
I just... I really need
to be alone right now.

07:02.494 --> 07:03.741
"Dear Kate,

07:04.039 --> 07:06.566
"I bet I've written this
letter a hundred times.

07:06.697 --> 07:08.539
"Someday, I might actually send it.

07:08.942 --> 07:10.909
"There's no excuse for what I did,

07:10.918 --> 07:12.598
"especially what I did to you.

07:12.638 --> 07:14.669
"But I'm on a righteous path now.

07:15.609 --> 07:18.458
And I hope someday, that path
earns me your forgiveness."

07:34.474 --> 07:35.304
Hi.

07:35.305 --> 07:36.489
Yeah.

07:42.337 --> 07:45.281
Excuse me. Detective Beckett? Yes.

07:45.282 --> 07:47.258
You've been upgraded to first class.

07:49.641 --> 07:51.738
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

07:52.946 --> 07:54.032
Sorry about that.

07:54.033 --> 07:55.094
Seat 3-c.

07:55.095 --> 07:56.213
Thank you.

08:01.702 --> 08:02.790
Champagne?

08:17.896 --> 08:19.153
Castle, what are you doing?

08:19.154 --> 08:20.900
Oh, the studio's been after me for weeks

08:20.901 --> 08:24.600
to fly down and do a set visit
for the "Heat Wave" movie.

08:24.637 --> 08:27.198
Imagine my surprise when I saw
your name on the standby list.

08:27.746 --> 08:29.986
You cannot be a part of what
I'm gonna do out there.

08:30.042 --> 08:32.217
I thought you were on vacation. Castle...

08:32.706 --> 08:34.527
It is one thing for you to follow me

08:34.528 --> 08:37.140
when we're in New York, but
I am not a cop in L.A.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.535
I don't have any authority or backup.

08:39.537 --> 08:40.818
I'll be your backup.

08:41.294 --> 08:43.629
Besides, going rogue is
kind of my specialty.

08:43.741 --> 08:45.709
Yeah, but subtlety isn't.

08:47.405 --> 08:49.070
I'm not gonna get rid of you, am I?

08:51.761 --> 08:53.026
Okay, look...

08:53.362 --> 08:55.508
If we do this together,
you have to promise me

08:55.509 --> 08:57.270
that we're gonna fly under the radar.

08:57.493 --> 08:58.645
Of course.

09:01.068 --> 09:03.068
La la la la,

09:15.241 --> 09:17.018
is this what you call "under the radar"?

09:17.065 --> 09:19.018
In L.A., this baby fits right in.

09:19.145 --> 09:22.169
So what's our first stop?
My hotel. It's on ventura blvd.

09:22.837 --> 09:24.389
That's all the way in the valley.

09:24.816 --> 09:26.748
How are we supposed to work
together if you're an hour away?

09:26.749 --> 09:29.596
Castle, we weren't supposed
to work together at all.

09:29.597 --> 09:32.475
Okay, look, the studio comped me
a two-bedroom, four-star suite.

09:32.476 --> 09:35.596
You just stay with me. Yeah, right.

09:35.698 --> 09:36.569
What? You'll have your own room.

09:36.570 --> 09:38.570
Uh, no. I am not staying with you.

09:38.801 --> 09:42.258
Ahh. Worried you can't control
yourself when we're alone?

09:42.415 --> 09:44.553
Actually, it's not me
that I'm worried about.

09:44.554 --> 09:46.504
I assure you, my intentions are pure.

09:54.585 --> 09:56.833
We're so happy to have you back, Mr.
Castle.

09:56.834 --> 09:58.347
I've taken the liberty
of setting up the suite

09:58.348 --> 10:00.218
just the way you like it. Thank you.

10:00.386 --> 10:02.547
And I've schedule a
couples massage at 7:00.

10:03.533 --> 10:06.613
Pure, huh? Uh, Maurice, you
can go ahead and cancel that,

10:06.614 --> 10:09.053
and get rid of the flowers
and the champagne.

10:09.054 --> 10:10.053
We're here to work.

10:10.054 --> 10:11.285
Very good, sir.

10:15.327 --> 10:16.557
For you.

10:17.198 --> 10:18.462
Thank you, Maurice.

10:21.805 --> 10:22.836
The last time I was here,

10:22.837 --> 10:25.176
I brought this Parisian super
model so he thought you...

10:25.177 --> 10:28.362
it's not important.
Would you like to choose your room?

10:28.498 --> 10:30.498
No, I'd like to start the investigation.

10:30.861 --> 10:32.365
We haven't even ordered room service yet.

10:32.366 --> 10:34.943
Castle, I'm not here for room service.

10:35.070 --> 10:36.333
I'm here for justice.

10:37.953 --> 10:40.732
Wow. In L.A. for all of a minute,

10:40.733 --> 10:43.017
and already she's spouting
cheesy movie dialogue.

10:44.018 --> 10:45.602
Must be something in the air.

10:48.177 --> 10:49.701
This is Royce's place?

10:49.702 --> 10:52.218
This is the address listed
on his driver's license.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.048
Did I miss the part where
you told me he was rich?

10:54.049 --> 10:56.081
No. He was barely scraping by.

10:57.313 --> 10:59.428
Yeah? Yeah, I'm a friend of Mike Royce's.

10:59.429 --> 11:00.549
Come around the back.

11:03.498 --> 11:05.676
Jerry, I cannot help you out. I'm sorry.

11:05.677 --> 11:07.357
You gotta go without. Yeah.

11:07.638 --> 11:08.678
I gotta go.

11:09.030 --> 11:11.629
Hello. Whoa. You're Gene Simmons.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.580
Yeah, I'm that weird guy in kiss.
Yeah, the guy with

11:13.581 --> 11:16.109
the long tongue and everything. Hello.

11:16.302 --> 11:17.725
Who's this pretty little lady?

11:17.926 --> 11:21.287
I'm, uh, I'm... I'm detective
Kate Beckett, NYPD.

11:22.693 --> 11:23.753
Is Mike in trouble?

11:23.754 --> 11:26.985
Actually, he was murdered.
Oh, that's terrible.

11:27.143 --> 11:28.885
How did you know him exactly?

11:28.886 --> 11:30.718
Well, I got into trouble a few months back,

11:30.719 --> 11:32.449
and Royce helped me out, I helped him,

11:32.450 --> 11:34.989
and I've been letting him
live in my guest house.

11:34.990 --> 11:36.269
So you're saying, he was in the business

11:36.270 --> 11:38.761
of helping people in trouble?
He was pretty good at it.

11:38.762 --> 11:41.626
Was he helping anyone lately?
Well, there was a girl.

11:41.770 --> 11:44.604
She came by two days ago.
Uh, really beautiful, stunning.

11:44.605 --> 11:47.122
Uh, this girl, do you remember her name?

11:48.254 --> 11:50.526
You know what? She dropped off a head shot.

11:50.725 --> 11:52.188
If you give me a chance, I'll go find it.

11:52.189 --> 11:53.244
Thank you.

11:54.555 --> 11:56.121
This is so weird.

11:56.369 --> 11:57.537
What?

11:58.014 --> 11:59.670
I've dressed up as him for Halloween.

11:59.671 --> 12:01.973
Mm. I did, too.

12:03.266 --> 12:05.988
Violet young, a smoking-hot wannabe starlet

12:05.989 --> 12:08.966
whose only credit is
Slumber Party Zombie.

12:09.294 --> 12:11.012
What kind of trouble would an actress be in

12:11.013 --> 12:12.902
that would scare Royce into running?

12:13.134 --> 12:15.855
What are you doing?
Pulling up Slumber Party Zombie on netflix.

12:16.978 --> 12:17.697
What are you doing?

12:17.698 --> 12:19.012
I'm gonna get ahold of Violet's agent,

12:19.013 --> 12:20.757
see if I can find out where she is.

12:21.458 --> 12:23.650
Yo, Ryan, what's up? We got lucky.

12:23.798 --> 12:25.960
Kids were tagging that building
across from the alley,

12:25.961 --> 12:27.610
so the owner put up a camera.

12:28.094 --> 12:29.089
There's our shooter.

12:29.090 --> 12:31.336
You can't see his face or
the license plate number.

12:31.337 --> 12:33.404
But you can see the driver's arm.

12:33.405 --> 12:36.124
A black guy. Ebony to our killer's ivory.

12:36.125 --> 12:38.081
You still got that friend at T.S.A.?
Yeah, why?

12:38.082 --> 12:39.641
Maybe they'll share surveillance footage

12:39.642 --> 12:41.836
of the security checkpoint
that our shooter went through.

12:41.837 --> 12:44.510
The guy was in town for six hours, right?

12:44.554 --> 12:46.814
There's a chance that he's
wearing the same clothes...

12:46.815 --> 12:48.803
At the airport that he's
wearing in our video...

12:48.804 --> 12:50.578
Which might get us a look at his face.

12:52.177 --> 12:55.621
So Violet's shooting a
commercial at Zenith Studios.

12:55.622 --> 12:57.808
No way. That's where they're
shooting "Heat Wave."

12:57.809 --> 12:59.377
Oh, wow. It's kismet.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.713
Violet's commercial shoots on stage seven.

13:18.806 --> 13:20.568
Rick Castle! Ha ha!

13:20.569 --> 13:23.056
I cannot believe we
finally got you out here.

13:23.057 --> 13:25.435
Tony, you money-grubbing bastard.

13:26.362 --> 13:27.812
How's filming? You kidding me?
It's awesome, buddy.

13:27.813 --> 13:29.336
You keep writing 'em,
we'll keep making 'em.

13:29.337 --> 13:31.456
Tony, I want you to meet Kate Beckett.

13:31.457 --> 13:33.280
This is the inspiration for Nikki Heat.

13:33.281 --> 13:36.345
Wow. With your looks, honey,
you could be an actress.

13:36.346 --> 13:38.053
I'm completely comfortable being a cop.

13:38.054 --> 13:39.129
I'm gonna go and look for Violet.

13:39.130 --> 13:41.002
It was nice to meet you. You, too.

13:41.145 --> 13:42.457
She's hot. Mm.

13:42.458 --> 13:44.521
No wonder your sex scenes are so steamy.

13:44.725 --> 13:47.637
So, uh, where's our Nikki
Heat, Natalie Rhodes?

13:48.381 --> 13:49.423
What?

13:49.737 --> 13:52.394
Natalie's having some personal issues.

13:52.677 --> 13:54.181
What kind of personal issues?
Let's just say,

13:54.182 --> 13:56.397
there was a slight mix-up with
one of her prescriptions.

13:56.398 --> 13:58.879
She's in rehab?
Hey, you did not hear that from me.

13:58.966 --> 14:00.985
Oh, there are the actors
who play Raley and Ochoa.

14:02.650 --> 14:05.321
Yeah, that's what I said.
This is your creator... Richard Castle.

14:05.322 --> 14:06.807
Yo. Big fan, bro.

14:06.808 --> 14:08.450
Thanks. I... oh.

14:11.197 --> 14:12.037
I've read all your books.

14:12.038 --> 14:12.549
If you have time, I'd love

14:12.550 --> 14:14.854
to talk about my motivation.
What do you mean?

14:14.855 --> 14:17.301
I mean, what's my character's inner life?

14:17.446 --> 14:18.465
Why do I do what I do?

14:18.466 --> 14:21.458
Ah. You're a cop, so it's your job.

14:22.378 --> 14:24.438
Castle. Violet didn't
show up to work today.

14:24.439 --> 14:25.186
I just talked to her agent.

14:25.187 --> 14:27.077
He said there's no way she
would've missed this commercial.

14:27.078 --> 14:29.447
This was a huge break for her.

14:31.269 --> 14:32.774
I've got her address.

14:33.194 --> 14:34.475
You think she's in trouble?

14:34.830 --> 14:36.217
Yeah, or worse.

14:36.218 --> 14:39.034
You guys on the job? Yeah, yeah.

14:41.711 --> 14:42.942
You guys look great.

14:45.696 --> 14:46.733
That is just creepy.

14:46.734 --> 14:48.094
Totally.

14:50.714 --> 14:51.915
Mm, mm.

14:52.317 --> 14:54.630
Hey. Hola, chica.

14:54.742 --> 14:56.021
What are you doing here?

14:56.278 --> 14:59.125
I was in the neighborhood. Mm.

14:59.464 --> 15:01.320
I thought I'd stop by and
see if those bullets

15:01.321 --> 15:03.864
you pulled out of Royce were
ready to go over to ballistics.

15:03.865 --> 15:04.408
I got a friend there

15:04.409 --> 15:06.377
who will make sure they
get processed right away.

15:09.731 --> 15:11.738
Mm. Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

15:11.739 --> 15:15.036
Is your "friend" that
top-heavy tramp in reception?

15:15.037 --> 15:16.529
Hmm? What?

15:16.530 --> 15:18.345
I... you know I only have eyes for you.
I don't even...

15:18.346 --> 15:22.842
mm-hmm. And you know I have
easy access to sharp objects.

15:25.185 --> 15:26.464
What the hell?

15:30.250 --> 15:31.737
Are those the bullets?

15:31.798 --> 15:33.959
Yeah. They're dissolving.

15:35.662 --> 15:37.704
I mean, ice bullets I've heard of.

15:37.705 --> 15:39.321
But dissolving bullets?

15:39.322 --> 15:41.306
Violet? Violet Young?

15:41.367 --> 15:43.211
You'd think somebody on
my conspiracy web sites

15:43.278 --> 15:44.637
would've mentioned them.

15:46.202 --> 15:47.578
I don't think Violet's home.

15:47.618 --> 15:48.785
Yeah.

15:55.823 --> 15:57.246
You sure this is okay?

15:57.773 --> 15:59.469
No, it is not okay.

15:59.470 --> 16:01.982
It is actually, completely...

16:03.278 --> 16:04.478
Illegal.

16:05.573 --> 16:06.933
Hello?

16:08.425 --> 16:09.563
Violet?

16:09.715 --> 16:11.106
I don't smell a dead body.

16:17.169 --> 16:17.937
She's not here.

16:17.938 --> 16:21.650
No, she's not. She's in New York.

16:22.769 --> 16:24.513
This was Royce's flight.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.962
Okay, so they flew together.

16:25.963 --> 16:28.845
He probably knew that they were in trouble

16:28.846 --> 16:31.742
and he tried to protect her
by taking her to New York.

16:33.194 --> 16:34.521
Protect her from what?

16:35.189 --> 16:36.470
Maybe from this?

16:37.277 --> 16:38.278
Surveillance photos?

16:38.279 --> 16:40.197
What would she be doing
with surveillance photos?

16:40.786 --> 16:43.137
Maybe Royce was doing some kind of
P.I. Work for her.

16:43.138 --> 16:44.210
Hmm.

16:44.347 --> 16:46.864
The building this guy is
coming out of looks familiar.

16:46.865 --> 16:51.452
She has articles on corgis,
on surfing, wine tasting.

16:51.453 --> 16:53.459
How does any of this add up?

16:53.460 --> 16:56.461
Maybe she was researching a role.
And what role would that be?

16:56.462 --> 16:58.588
And what does any of it
have to do with Royce?

16:58.732 --> 17:01.166
The power of... sound... compels you...

17:10.821 --> 17:12.278
Cops. Cops. Cops.

17:12.803 --> 17:14.338
Photo.. Okay.

17:15.430 --> 17:16.358
Okay, go.

17:18.346 --> 17:19.657
L.A.P.D.!

17:20.244 --> 17:21.569
Don't move.

17:33.329 --> 17:35.970
Thanks afternoon.

17:36.121 --> 17:38.493
Kyle Seeger, robbery-homicide.

17:38.494 --> 17:40.002
Look, Kyle, this is a misunderstanding...

17:40.003 --> 17:41.325
meaning you didn't pick the lock

17:41.326 --> 17:45.180
or illegally enter this house?
Meaning she's NYPD.

17:45.698 --> 17:47.260
I know who you are, detective.

17:47.261 --> 17:49.456
And while I can appreciate your loss,

17:49.457 --> 17:51.572
I can't have you and your offbeat sidekick

17:51.573 --> 17:53.441
running around my town committing felonies

17:53.442 --> 17:55.622
in some misguided quest for justice.

17:55.623 --> 17:57.233
Are... are you arresting us?

17:57.234 --> 17:58.402
Oh, much worse.

17:58.834 --> 18:00.657
Somebody wants to have a word with you.

18:01.402 --> 18:02.650
You're on speaker, sir.

18:03.029 --> 18:04.256
Breaking into people's houses...

18:04.257 --> 18:06.568
that's your idea of a vacation, Beckett?

18:06.569 --> 18:09.486
Sir. I can explain. I was...
no, you cannot.

18:09.487 --> 18:10.164
What you can do is get

18:10.165 --> 18:12.185
your ass on the next plane out. Uh, we have

18:12.186 --> 18:14.325
a dinner reservation at spago.
Is the morning okay?

18:14.326 --> 18:16.717
Oh, this is all a big joke
to you, isn't it, castle?

18:16.718 --> 18:18.844
But when Beckett is working
mall security, I guess

18:18.845 --> 18:21.598
following her around isn't gonna
have quite the same allure.

18:21.706 --> 18:25.481
Both of you, come home now.

18:27.677 --> 18:28.180
Wow.

18:28.181 --> 18:29.173
That was awkward.

18:29.950 --> 18:31.479
You know, unless there's something else,

18:31.480 --> 18:32.582
I think we should go now.

18:35.102 --> 18:38.333
Hey, one last thing.
Did you find what you were looking for?

18:39.142 --> 18:40.325
Wrong house.

18:41.098 --> 18:43.722
Welcome to L.A., detective. Now go home.

18:44.923 --> 18:46.772
Would Montgomery really fire you? Yeah.

18:46.773 --> 18:49.100
So we're going back to New York. Hell, no.

18:53.837 --> 18:54.805
Detective Ryan.

18:54.806 --> 18:56.134
Hey, it's me. Can you talk?

18:56.726 --> 18:59.304
Yeah, but Montgomery is seriously fired up.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.354
Yeah, I know.
Look, I need a favor from you,

19:01.355 --> 19:02.723
but you can feel free to say no.

19:02.724 --> 19:04.289
Oh, come on.
Whatever it is, I'm saying yes.

19:04.290 --> 19:05.157
Okay, great. Thanks.

19:05.158 --> 19:07.541
We think that Royce had company
when he traveled to New York.

19:07.542 --> 19:09.421
Her name is Violet Young. We think

19:09.422 --> 19:11.954
whatever trouble he was into,
she was involved somehow.

19:11.955 --> 19:14.521
You think she's still in town?
Unless McCauley got to her first.

19:14.522 --> 19:17.464
Her head shot lists an
acting school in New York.

19:17.465 --> 19:18.453
She might have friends out there.

19:18.454 --> 19:20.168
Can you see if she contacted any of them?

19:20.169 --> 19:21.470
You got it. I'll keep you posted.

19:21.471 --> 19:22.599
Great. Thank you.

19:23.595 --> 19:26.793
Uh, Esposito's got something.
Beckett, line two.

19:28.934 --> 19:31.097
'Sup, girl?
How's the weather in your world?

19:31.098 --> 19:32.845
Sunny, chance of ass kicking.
What do you got?

19:32.846 --> 19:35.857
A photo of our killer courtesy of T.S.A.

19:35.858 --> 19:37.250
M shooting it over to you now.

19:44.301 --> 19:45.646
And that's Neel McCauley?

19:45.668 --> 19:48.556
Well, whoever he is, he wore the
exact same clothes at J.F.K.

19:48.557 --> 19:51.066
As he did in that alley.
That's how we got him.

19:51.067 --> 19:53.405
Okay, look, this is a long shot,
but run facial recognition

19:53.406 --> 19:56.046
through the federal and local databases.
You got it.

19:57.081 --> 19:59.429
I found him. Neel McCauley?

19:59.430 --> 20:01.893
No. The mystery man from the
photo in Violet's place.

20:01.894 --> 20:03.384
I realized where I'd seen that building

20:03.385 --> 20:04.748
he was coming out of before.

20:04.749 --> 20:06.033
It was the bad guys' headquarters

20:06.034 --> 20:08.129
in "Primal Fury: Primal vengeance."

20:08.158 --> 20:10.636
So did a little Internet search,
and bam, said the lady,

20:10.637 --> 20:12.764
found it's the home of
Kelvin North America.

20:12.765 --> 20:14.334
Some kind of R&D facility.

20:14.335 --> 20:16.489
The chief executive officer
is Charles Kelvin.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.748
Guess what his hobbies are.

20:18.274 --> 20:22.098
"Wine, corgis and surfing.
" Violet was studying him.

20:25.109 --> 20:26.117
Mr. Kelvin!

20:26.559 --> 20:27.573
Mr. Kelvin.

20:28.446 --> 20:30.525
Your assistant said that
we could find you here.

20:30.526 --> 20:31.660
This is my surf hour,

20:31.661 --> 20:33.420
so whatever you have to say,
it can wait till I'm done.

20:33.421 --> 20:35.612
No, it can't. I'm detective Kate Beckett.

20:35.613 --> 20:38.222
This is Richard Castle.
Do you recognize this woman?

20:38.834 --> 20:39.842
Sure.

20:41.228 --> 20:43.898
I met her in line for coffee
last Friday, asked her out.

20:44.365 --> 20:46.277
Thought the date was going well
till she went to the bathroom

20:46.278 --> 20:49.149
and never came back.
What's this all about anyways?

20:49.150 --> 20:50.525
Something happen to her?

20:50.599 --> 20:52.196
Does this recording mean anything to you?

20:52.557 --> 20:54.532
The power of... sound... compels you...

20:54.533 --> 20:56.636
isn't that your voice? That bitch.

20:56.637 --> 20:57.992
What does that mean? That phrase

20:57.993 --> 21:00.065
is the key to our high security vault.
Violet must

21:00.066 --> 21:01.754
have pieced it together from
words I said during the date.

21:01.755 --> 21:03.130
I gotta get back to the office.

21:05.849 --> 21:07.097
No.

21:07.669 --> 21:09.510
They're gone. What was in here?

21:09.841 --> 21:11.379
That's proprietary information.

21:12.650 --> 21:13.738
A bullet?

21:13.802 --> 21:15.354
I'm guessing it dissolves.

21:16.278 --> 21:17.556
How do you know about those?

21:17.557 --> 21:19.718
They were used in a murder. God.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.695
We created them to try to
land a defense contract

21:22.696 --> 21:24.197
in ultralight ammunition.

21:24.458 --> 21:26.586
The dissolving property
was a complete accident.

21:26.979 --> 21:28.504
Unfortunately, it rendered
the bullets useless

21:28.505 --> 21:31.050
to the military.
Yeah, but valuable to someone else.

21:32.296 --> 21:34.072
Now how the hell did this happen?

21:36.117 --> 21:39.286
Hey. Good news on Violet. You found her?

21:39.362 --> 21:41.528
Uh... not that good, but she is alive.

21:41.529 --> 21:43.145
Or at least she was last night.

21:43.210 --> 21:44.785
Tracked down an ex of hers who said

21:44.786 --> 21:46.950
she showed up on his doorstep,
scared out of her mind,

21:46.951 --> 21:48.869
told him she had come out from
L.A. With Royce,

21:48.870 --> 21:51.673
but he had disappeared, so the
ex let her stay the night.

21:51.674 --> 21:54.314
Next morning, Violet was
gone, so was his wallet.

21:54.606 --> 21:57.326
He know where she was headed?
Uh, no, but two hours later,

21:57.327 --> 21:58.848
a large African-American gentleman

21:58.849 --> 22:00.476
with a fondness for
kidney punches showed up

22:00.477 --> 22:01.620
and asked that very same question.

22:01.621 --> 22:02.917
The driver who picked up McCauley.

22:02.918 --> 22:04.036
Mm-hmm, that's what I was thinking.

22:04.037 --> 22:05.544
Worked the ex over pretty good, too.

22:05.545 --> 22:06.496
Let's get him with a sketch artist.

22:06.497 --> 22:07.969
Way ahead of you, bro.

22:10.697 --> 22:13.162
Looks like we're not the only
ones hunting for Violet.

22:14.470 --> 22:16.760
Picture this... a gullible young actress,

22:16.761 --> 22:18.778
desperate to make a name for herself.

22:18.983 --> 22:22.155
She meets our mastermind at a club.

22:22.682 --> 22:25.833
He needs a pretty girl to
help him get the voice code.

22:26.305 --> 22:28.957
He tells Violet he's a producer,
promises to make her famous

22:28.958 --> 22:31.781
if she helps him play a
practical joke on a friend.

22:31.782 --> 22:32.712
She doesn't even realize

22:32.713 --> 22:34.545
that she's participating in
a crime until afterwards.

22:34.546 --> 22:37.072
She can't call the cops,
so she contacts Royce.

22:37.073 --> 22:38.797
But then our Mr. McCauley finds out.

22:38.798 --> 22:40.973
And Royce tries to change the game.

22:40.974 --> 22:44.158
He goes to New York...
home field advantage.

22:44.709 --> 22:47.106
Classic. Classic Royce.

22:50.966 --> 22:53.218
I was so in awe of him, Castle,

22:53.219 --> 22:54.401
when I first met him.

22:55.518 --> 22:57.289
I just hung on his every word.

22:58.599 --> 22:59.619
And then later, I realized,

22:59.620 --> 23:01.843
he was just making up
stories to mess with me.

23:08.865 --> 23:11.154
I can't believe that I'm
never gonna see him again.

23:17.723 --> 23:19.483
You know what I thought
when I first met you?

23:20.061 --> 23:21.183
Hmm?

23:24.743 --> 23:26.904
That you were a mystery I
was never gonna solve.

23:30.191 --> 23:31.517
Even now,

23:32.894 --> 23:34.272
after spending all this time with you,

23:34.273 --> 23:35.714
I'm...

23:37.214 --> 23:38.724
I'm still amazed

23:38.725 --> 23:40.294
at the depths of your strength,

23:41.539 --> 23:42.642
your heart...

23:45.073 --> 23:46.354
And your hotness.

23:47.897 --> 23:49.817
You're not so bad yourself, Castle.

24:02.610 --> 24:03.650
So I...

24:04.042 --> 24:05.498
I should go. It's late.

24:06.085 --> 24:06.982
Good night.

24:07.802 --> 24:10.423
And your crooked face with the daisies

24:10.629 --> 24:11.813
Kate.

24:12.855 --> 24:13.928
Good night, Castle.

24:14.038 --> 24:16.757
And I keep me in a vacant lot

24:16.758 --> 24:19.412
in the ivies, forget-me-nots

24:19.413 --> 24:21.692
hoping you will come and untangle me

24:21.693 --> 24:24.094
one of these days

24:25.393 --> 24:32.550
come and... find me now

24:36.194 --> 24:38.794
come and... find me now

25:12.895 --> 25:13.920
wow.

25:14.645 --> 25:16.742
Somebody's up early. Hey.

25:17.310 --> 25:18.974
What, did you pack a murder board?

25:19.511 --> 25:20.412
Concierge.

25:22.678 --> 25:25.241
Oh, Maurice is amazing, isn't he? Yeah.

25:25.242 --> 25:27.722
I bet if I ordered the ark of the
covenant, he'd come through.

25:27.869 --> 25:31.293
Wouldn't you be afraid to open it?
No. It only melts Nazis.

25:31.557 --> 25:33.170
Is that, uh, Kelvin North America?

25:33.171 --> 25:34.924
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out this heist.

25:34.925 --> 25:37.552
Kelvin said that the last
time that vault was accessed

25:37.553 --> 25:40.793
46 Tuesday night.
Well, that must be when our thieves

25:40.794 --> 25:43.245
stole the high-tech ammo. 800 pounds worth,

25:43.246 --> 25:44.321
and they would've had to take it

25:44.322 --> 25:47.253
out the loading dock.
But that guard station there,

25:47.254 --> 25:48.988
I remember seeing that when we went in.

25:48.989 --> 25:51.016
There's no way they could
get all that ammo past him

25:51.017 --> 25:53.609
without a little insider help. Exactly.

25:53.610 --> 25:55.496
So I called the security
company, and they said that

25:55.497 --> 25:57.354
the only guard that was
stationed at the loading bay

25:57.355 --> 25:59.748
that night was some guy named Reggie Walsh.

25:59.749 --> 26:02.003
I feel the plot about to thicken.

26:02.004 --> 26:03.846
He asked to be reassigned the next day.

26:05.758 --> 26:06.909
Are you expecting anyone?

26:07.113 --> 26:07.980
No.

26:07.981 --> 26:09.742
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

26:22.909 --> 26:24.094
Detective Seeger.

26:24.238 --> 26:26.317
Mr. Castle. Do come in.

26:28.317 --> 26:31.118
Wow. Nice digs.

26:31.865 --> 26:35.354
It sure pays to travel with
a best-selling author, huh?

26:35.509 --> 26:37.441
Seeger, if you're here to
drive us to the airport,

26:37.442 --> 26:38.913
we're not packed yet. I'm here

26:38.914 --> 26:42.006
because a report crossed
my desk about a theft

26:42.007 --> 26:43.461
at Kelvin North America.

26:43.785 --> 26:45.294
Your names jumped out at me.

26:46.194 --> 26:48.713
Now tell me, what does the
theft of high-tech bullets

26:48.714 --> 26:50.720
have to do with your murder investigation?

26:50.721 --> 26:53.785
We're not investigating a
murder anymore, remember?

26:53.865 --> 26:54.913
We're off the case.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.322
Are we gonna do that dance?

26:56.879 --> 27:00.209
Look, we don't know any more
about that theft than you do.

27:01.425 --> 27:02.873
But if we stumble across something

27:02.874 --> 27:04.970
on our way to the airport, we'll
be sure and let you know.

27:05.525 --> 27:06.727
See that you do.

27:09.473 --> 27:10.176
Detective.

27:10.177 --> 27:11.202
Good-bye.

27:14.027 --> 27:16.250
Are you sure it's such a
good idea, cutting him out?

27:16.366 --> 27:17.701
He might be able to help us.

27:17.702 --> 27:20.320
Castle, the only thing Seeger
cares about is that robbery,

27:20.321 --> 27:21.291
not Royce's murder.

27:21.292 --> 27:24.456
What we need to do is question
that guard... Reggie Walsh.

27:24.457 --> 27:27.289
How? You're not a cop here, remember?

27:28.315 --> 27:29.913
Reggie doesn't need to know that.

27:31.121 --> 27:32.193
Oh.

27:36.294 --> 27:38.396
Like I told you, I don't know
anything about a robbery.

27:38.397 --> 27:40.388
Gimme a break, Reggie. You're lying.

27:40.389 --> 27:41.225
You're a punk.

27:41.226 --> 27:44.185
A dirty skell. A low-down, rat bastard...

27:44.186 --> 27:45.584
easy, guys.

27:45.585 --> 27:47.970
Yeah, I-I mean, we all
wear the uniform, right?

27:48.825 --> 27:51.338
Yeah, I just hope yours
makes you look good on tv.

27:51.814 --> 27:52.577
What are you talking about?

27:52.578 --> 27:54.475
The news cameras outside of the precinct.

27:54.476 --> 27:56.921
They just love a good perp walk, Reggie.

27:56.922 --> 27:58.699
And if you're mixed up with this, I'm sure

27:58.700 --> 28:00.877
you wouldn't want to be
seen talking to the cops.

28:00.878 --> 28:03.070
So as a courtesy,

28:03.810 --> 28:06.881
I am going to let you
cover up with my jacket.

28:12.176 --> 28:14.240
I wouldn't take it off before
we get into the interview room.

28:14.241 --> 28:16.082
There might be reporters on the inside.

28:16.146 --> 28:17.155
Okay.

28:20.826 --> 28:22.426
You're a security guard, Reggie.

28:22.646 --> 28:25.798
In prison, you're the lowest of the low.

28:27.510 --> 28:29.557
I-I thought that was child molesters.

28:30.409 --> 28:31.465
Yeah, well...

28:32.269 --> 28:35.086
Dude, security guard.

28:35.376 --> 28:39.154
And you know what they do to
guys like you in lompoc. No.

28:39.614 --> 28:41.291
What? That's... this is a latte.

28:41.323 --> 28:43.929
Okay, I drink chai tea lattes.

28:43.930 --> 28:45.105
How long do you have to work for me

28:45.106 --> 28:47.265
until you get that right? Huh?
Or maybe... come on, Reggie.

28:47.266 --> 28:48.978
We know you were at the
loading bay that night.

28:49.781 --> 28:51.223
All right. Um...

28:52.990 --> 28:54.414
These two guys came toe.

28:54.786 --> 28:57.602
Offered me 500 bucks to take a
cigarette break at midnight.

28:57.929 --> 29:00.421
The only reason I went
along is because saying no

29:00.422 --> 29:03.784
didn't really seem like an option.
Are these the men?

29:04.689 --> 29:06.125
Yeah. Yeah.

29:06.126 --> 29:08.174
Did they give you their names? No.

29:08.698 --> 29:10.579
Oh, but, uh, when they were walking away,

29:10.580 --> 29:12.341
the black guy called the other guy Ganz.

29:14.346 --> 29:15.289
All right, guys. Thanks very much.

29:15.290 --> 29:18.057
We're done with the room. Open-do!

29:20.834 --> 29:22.029
What the hell?

29:22.245 --> 29:23.558
Welcome to Hollywood.

29:24.039 --> 29:25.357
Great scene, Ricky.

29:25.373 --> 29:28.001
You said she was a star, and that's right.

29:28.390 --> 29:29.750
Does this mean I can leave?

29:30.227 --> 29:32.065
His name is Russell Ganz.
Suspected of pulling off

29:32.066 --> 29:34.816
several high-profile heists
during the last five years,

29:34.817 --> 29:35.653
including the theft

29:35.654 --> 29:38.373
of military-grade circuit boards in 2009.

29:38.518 --> 29:41.341
Ganz is very smart and very violent.

29:41.342 --> 29:43.090
His multimillion-dollar
scores have allowed him

29:43.091 --> 29:45.480
to live like royalty...
fast cars, hot women.

29:45.481 --> 29:47.431
Dissolving bullets would be worth a fortune

29:47.432 --> 29:50.871
for the right buyer, like
a gang or a drug cartel.

29:50.872 --> 29:53.037
Do we have an L.A. address for Ganz

29:53.038 --> 29:54.365
or any known associates?

29:54.366 --> 29:55.682
Uh, negative on the address.

29:55.683 --> 29:58.440
And it looks like most of his
friends are incarcerated.

29:58.441 --> 29:59.562
Wait.

29:59.753 --> 30:01.848
Yeah, here's one that's not. Donald Mannis.

30:01.849 --> 30:03.900
He looks exactly like
the guy hunting Violet.

30:03.901 --> 30:05.475
Okay, mannis might lead us to Ganz,

30:05.476 --> 30:07.494
so let's get his photo to all the troops.

30:07.495 --> 30:09.080
Got it. I'll get back to you.

30:09.728 --> 30:11.144
We gotta find Ganz fast.

30:11.145 --> 30:13.908
Once he fences those bullets,
he's gonna disappear.

30:13.953 --> 30:16.793
Don't worry.
The guy likes the perks of wealth?

30:16.794 --> 30:18.734
I know just the guy to help us find him.

30:18.735 --> 30:20.916
Oh, Mr. Ganz is well-known
within my network.

30:20.917 --> 30:23.419
He's a frequent guest at our
city's five-star hotels.

30:23.420 --> 30:24.996
Do you actually know where he is?

30:24.997 --> 30:27.210
At a poolside cabana at the eastway.

30:27.464 --> 30:28.996
He enjoys being surrounded
by beautiful women

30:28.997 --> 30:30.487
as he conducts business
on the phone, which,

30:30.488 --> 30:33.268
according to a poolside waiter,
he's doing as we speak.

30:33.541 --> 30:36.100
Maurice, thank you very much.
You never fail to amaze.

30:36.241 --> 30:38.448
My pleasure, sir, ma'am.

30:41.124 --> 30:43.153
Okay, so if Ganz is doing
business poolside,

30:43.154 --> 30:46.247
he's probably trying to find
a buyer for those bullets.

30:46.248 --> 30:47.414
And if I can put him with those bullets,

30:47.415 --> 30:48.961
I can prove he killed Royce. Well,

30:48.962 --> 30:51.156
don't you think it's time
we called the L.A.P.D.?

30:52.752 --> 30:54.379
I think I have a better idea.

31:09.591 --> 31:11.183
It's time for a celebration.

31:11.465 --> 31:13.145
Set it up for tonight, will you, Max?

31:13.547 --> 31:14.503
Yes, sir.

31:56.922 --> 31:59.200
I appreciate a woman who knows
how to make an entrance.

32:00.649 --> 32:01.863
You staying at the hotel?

32:01.882 --> 32:05.538
No, I'm meeting someone.
Business or pleasure?

32:05.836 --> 32:07.317
Hopefully a bit of both...

32:08.027 --> 32:09.198
Mr. Ganz.

32:10.633 --> 32:12.627
I'm Lola Black. Please sit.

32:17.441 --> 32:19.115
What can I do for you, Ms. black?

32:19.669 --> 32:21.923
I represent a small but powerful group

32:21.924 --> 32:24.034
of Colombian business interests,

32:24.035 --> 32:26.808
and they understand that you're
in possession of some...

32:27.129 --> 32:29.045
Unique merchandise.

32:31.916 --> 32:33.700
I'm afraid you've got me
confused with someone else.

32:33.701 --> 32:35.173
Oh, I don't think so.

32:35.424 --> 32:37.456
That business in New York, that ex-cop?

32:37.457 --> 32:40.104
It was a very effective
product demonstration.

32:41.028 --> 32:42.937
My offer is serious, and my clients

32:42.938 --> 32:45.653
are not accustomed to
hearing the words "no."

32:47.377 --> 32:50.623
Well... the bidding on that particular item

32:50.624 --> 32:52.551
closed about 20 minutes ago.

32:52.704 --> 32:53.973
Better luck next time.

32:53.974 --> 32:55.149
Wait, uh...

32:56.572 --> 32:57.698
$2 million.

32:58.461 --> 33:00.366
I-I can have it here within an hour.

33:04.818 --> 33:06.037
I'm impressed, actually,

33:06.038 --> 33:07.506
the way you lured me in.

33:08.461 --> 33:10.114
You had me guessing there for a second.

33:10.115 --> 33:12.634
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you're a cop.

33:13.191 --> 33:14.183
You're the hottest thing I've seen

33:14.184 --> 33:16.407
come out of major crimes
in quite some time.

33:16.910 --> 33:19.791
But you're a little too
eager, a little green.

33:21.839 --> 33:23.336
Nice meeting you, Lola.

33:27.477 --> 33:29.156
Oh, God, Castle.

33:33.479 --> 33:34.583
So what happened?

33:35.099 --> 33:36.890
Ow! I was trying to keep
him from seeing you,

33:36.891 --> 33:38.663
and so I pushed too hard, and he made me.

33:38.664 --> 33:39.937
He called me green, Castle. What the

33:39.938 --> 33:42.685
hell were you doing?
I saw his phone in the cabana.

33:42.686 --> 33:44.599
I thought it was worth the risk.
You took his phone?

33:44.600 --> 33:46.151
No! No, I took a picture

33:46.152 --> 33:48.216
of his recent call list. What? Where is it?

33:48.217 --> 33:51.445
Don't... don't poke me. Poke you?
I want to kiss you.

33:52.624 --> 33:53.508
Okay, we need to run down these numbers,

33:53.509 --> 33:55.482
see if we can trace one
of them to Ganz's buyer.

33:55.483 --> 33:57.667
Okay, now can we call Seeger?

34:00.529 --> 34:03.449
Gentlemen, where are we with Violet Young?

34:03.450 --> 34:04.832
I just got off the phone with her mother.

34:04.833 --> 34:06.863
She said she remembers
Violet having a roommate

34:06.864 --> 34:07.831
who lives near canal street.

34:07.832 --> 34:09.039
Yeah, we're gonna head over there and see

34:09.040 --> 34:10.717
if Violet reached out to her.
Well, let me know.

34:10.717 --> 34:13.657
Yeah, right. Hey, you heard from Beckett?

34:15.550 --> 34:17.444
No, sir. Yeah, me neither.

34:17.620 --> 34:19.165
She's not answering her cell.

34:19.331 --> 34:20.663
Maybe she's airborne.

34:21.074 --> 34:23.262
Uh-huh. Yeah, that would explain
her phone being turned off.

34:24.824 --> 34:29.270
You know, I'm trying to
decide who is the worse liar,

34:29.428 --> 34:30.675
him or you.

34:33.402 --> 34:34.415
Go find Violet Young.

34:34.416 --> 34:36.597
Help Beckett put this
thing to bed, all right?

34:36.598 --> 34:38.053
Yes, sir. Right on.

34:45.978 --> 34:47.902
Hey, detective see... hey.

34:48.784 --> 34:51.145
You run wild in my city, then
you call me for a favor?

34:51.320 --> 34:52.471
You got a lot of nerve, detective.

34:52.472 --> 34:53.475
I'll give you that.
Hey, we're trying to get

34:53.476 --> 34:55.524
a vicious criminal off of your streets.

34:55.525 --> 34:57.147
Hey, can I interest you
in one of these robes?

34:57.148 --> 35:00.446
Before you say no, feel how soft this is.
No, thank you.

35:00.447 --> 35:02.160
Look, we're all on the same team now,

35:02.161 --> 35:03.360
so why don't we just get this done with?

35:03.361 --> 35:05.005
As long as it gets done my way.

35:05.006 --> 35:06.421
Fine. What do you got?

35:08.526 --> 35:09.775
Well, Ganz's phone is a burner,

35:09.776 --> 35:11.668
and so are most of the numbers he called.

35:11.669 --> 35:13.290
Which means you didn't get the buyer's I.D.

35:13.291 --> 35:15.079
We did manage to trace one
of the burners he called

35:15.080 --> 35:18.033
to New York City. Mannis.
That's Ganz's partner.

35:18.034 --> 35:19.343
I bet Ganz was calling to ask

35:19.344 --> 35:20.854
why the hell Violet Young was still alive.

35:20.855 --> 35:21.739
Did you happen to get a location

35:21.740 --> 35:23.873
on mannis' phone?
Just that it's in Manhattan.

35:23.874 --> 35:26.420
Okay. So let's call him, rile him up a bit.
Rile him up how?

35:26.421 --> 35:27.710
I'll tell him I met Ganz.

35:27.711 --> 35:29.281
Ganz was gonna cut him out of the deal.

35:29.282 --> 35:31.491
Mannis wasn't pulling his weight.
Mannis gets pissed,

35:31.492 --> 35:33.072
he calls Ganz, maybe one of them

35:33.073 --> 35:34.039
lets something slip about the

35:34.040 --> 35:36.405
location of the exchange.
And we'll be listening.

35:36.942 --> 35:39.422
Good. I'll try and get a warrant.

35:42.463 --> 35:44.087
You're a hard girl to find, Violet.

35:44.088 --> 35:45.577
I know it was wrong to run,

35:45.578 --> 35:48.584
but I was afraid to go to the cops.

35:48.964 --> 35:51.098
I never meant for Royce to get hurt.

35:52.311 --> 35:53.891
Well, let's just get back
to the station, Violet.

35:53.892 --> 35:56.134
We can work it out, all right? Let's go.

35:59.656 --> 36:00.605
Gun!

36:00.674 --> 36:02.071
Down! Down! Down!

36:04.705 --> 36:05.606
You okay?

36:05.607 --> 36:07.218
Yeah. You? Yeah.

36:07.219 --> 36:08.315
You okay? Yeah.

36:08.316 --> 36:09.715
Wait right here, all right?

36:17.701 --> 36:18.983
Esposito?

36:19.957 --> 36:20.469
Beckett?

36:20.470 --> 36:23.284
Are you with Mannis? Yeah. I just shot him.

36:23.839 --> 36:24.993
Why are you calling him?

36:24.994 --> 36:26.403
Look, we need to know where and when Ganz

36:26.404 --> 36:31.374
is selling those bullets.
Don, where's the deal going down?

36:31.375 --> 36:34.462
I'm hit man. Call an ambulance.
Well, my partner's on that.

36:34.463 --> 36:37.453
9-1... what... what come after that one?

36:37.454 --> 36:40.501
I'm in pain here, man! It's over, Mannis.

36:40.714 --> 36:41.679
If you give us the meet location,

36:41.680 --> 36:44.709
I'll tell the D.A. In L.A.
That you cooperated.

36:47.646 --> 36:48.980
Aah! I'll tell you.

36:49.194 --> 36:51.220
Santa Monica pier! 6:00!

36:51.221 --> 36:53.856
Now call an ambulance! Who shot Royce?

36:54.668 --> 36:55.804
It was Ganz.

37:00.008 --> 37:02.315
You get that? Yeah, we got it. Thanks.

37:03.409 --> 37:04.749
Gotta get to Santa Monica pier.

37:04.750 --> 37:06.316
It's quarter of 6:00 now.

37:06.317 --> 37:08.345
This is gonna be our
last chance to get Ganz.

37:08.346 --> 37:09.610
Let's roll.

37:45.260 --> 37:47.009
L.A.P.D. Freeze.

37:47.282 --> 37:49.796
Put the case down. Put the case down.

37:50.262 --> 37:51.607
Get hands behind your head.

37:53.023 --> 37:56.112
You in the van! Police.
Both hands out the window.

37:58.739 --> 38:00.582
Open the door. Get out slow.

38:04.320 --> 38:05.468
Slowly.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.256
Up against the van.

38:08.747 --> 38:10.321
Up against the van!

38:10.686 --> 38:11.709
Give me your hand.

38:12.074 --> 38:13.527
Where is he? Where's Ganz?

38:14.833 --> 38:15.989
Aah! Where is he?

38:31.479 --> 38:32.415
Bingo.

38:34.708 --> 38:35.837
Where did Beckett go?

39:11.209 --> 39:13.696
Police! Stop!

39:44.903 --> 39:46.357
I knew you were a cop.

39:46.545 --> 39:48.671
My name is detective Kate Beckett,

39:48.682 --> 39:50.175
NYPD.

39:50.852 --> 39:53.059
Michael Royce was my friend.

39:54.386 --> 39:55.164
You shot him

39:55.165 --> 39:58.214
and you left him in an alley
like a piece of garbage.

39:59.696 --> 40:01.482
Consider this poetic justice.

40:03.298 --> 40:06.041
He said something about
hell raining down on me.

40:07.527 --> 40:10.761
I never imagined hell looked like you.

40:23.384 --> 40:24.309
Kate!

40:25.040 --> 40:26.636
Russell Ganz, you are under arrest

40:26.637 --> 40:28.746
for the murder of Michael Royce.

40:39.290 --> 40:40.257
You okay?

40:42.174 --> 40:43.109
Yeah.

41:18.777 --> 41:22.238
So how close did you come... with Ganz?

41:29.684 --> 41:30.993
Let's go home, castle.

41:34.701 --> 41:36.625
"And now for the hard part, kid.

41:37.165 --> 41:40.444
"It's clear that you and
castle have something real,

41:41.087 --> 41:42.690
"and you're fighting it.

41:43.603 --> 41:44.808
"But trust me,

41:45.565 --> 41:47.497
"putting the job ahead of your heart

41:47.498 --> 41:48.905
"is a mistake.

41:49.855 --> 41:52.406
"Risking our hearts is why we're alive.

41:53.790 --> 41:56.407
"The last thing you want is
to look back on your life

41:56.408 --> 41:57.648
"and wonder...

41:58.480 --> 41:59.583
If only."
