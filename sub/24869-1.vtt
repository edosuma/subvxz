Please...

02:41.375 --> 02:43.042
Please...

03:24.375 --> 03:25.833
Miss Watson...

03:27.083 --> 03:31.042
Has it happened a bit unusual
or strange in the last week?

03:34.250 --> 03:36.042
I do not see your face.

03:37.667 --> 03:40.000
Come out into the light.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.375
-If you talk, I'm coming out of the light.
-No! Not until I know who you are!

03:52.667 --> 03:54.667
Just answer the question.

04:06.292 --> 04:07.875
Miss Watson...

04:09.292 --> 04:11.667
I do not know what you're talking about.

04:14.792 --> 04:16.750
Think carefully.

04:24.833 --> 04:27.250
What happened to you last week?

04:34.125 --> 04:36.375
Try to remember.

04:45.625 --> 04:47.375
Okay.

04:57.333 --> 04:59.000
Okay.

05:04.583 --> 05:10.333
6 DAYS EARLIER

06:38.167 --> 06:41.375
Hi, this is April Watson.
I'm not in.

06:41.458 --> 06:44.000
Leave a message and I'll
call as fast as I can.

06:45.625 --> 06:49.333
Hi, tax.
I got your number by Becky.

06:50.625 --> 06:53.167
She said your phone
is still broken.

06:55.083 --> 06:59.750
You should really fix the phone.
How else can I get you?

07:04.208 --> 07:07.667
Pardon.
I just do not know what to say.

07:10.250 --> 07:13.458
After three years of marriage,
could you at least call back?

07:13.542 --> 07:15.042
Four.

07:17.250 --> 07:19.083
I love you.

07:21.458 --> 07:25.250
Please call me.

07:27.833 --> 07:29.292
Please.

07:32.375 --> 07:33.833
April...

07:37.875 --> 07:39.792
Call me.

07:46.625 --> 07:50.167
DAY 1

10:03.458 --> 10:04.667
Six!

10:04.750 --> 10:05.917
Five!

10:06.000 --> 10:07.167
Four!

10:07.250 --> 10:08.667
Three!

10:08.750 --> 10:09.875
Two!

10:10.000 --> 10:11.208
One!

10:14.458 --> 10:16.458
Happy New Year!

10:54.250 --> 10:57.500
Hi, this is April Watson.
I'm not in.

10:57.583 --> 11:00.792
Leave a message and I'll
call as fast as I can.

11:04.083 --> 11:08.375
Hi, Miss Watson.
We apply for volunteers for a study

11:08.458 --> 11:12.958
of an anxiolytic medicine.
It may be something for you.

11:13.042 --> 11:16.292
For participation only a short
medical examination is required.

11:16.375 --> 11:20.125
And... the volunteers get 2500 dollars.

11:21.167 --> 11:27.375
Call if you are interested.
The number is 212... 367... 0...

11:32.542 --> 11:34.333
Did you call them?

11:42.167 --> 11:44.583
I can not help you if you
do not say anything.

11:47.375 --> 11:48.667
So...

11:49.667 --> 11:51.417
Did you call them?

12:12.875 --> 12:14.125
Good bye.

12:19.708 --> 12:21.958
I'm here for the study.

12:22.042 --> 12:25.375
-You must be Miss Watson.
-Yes. Sorry, I'm a little late.

12:26.042 --> 12:28.500
It does not matter.
Just sign in here.

12:29.542 --> 12:31.042
Okay.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.708
Here are some forms to fill out.

12:33.792 --> 12:35.458
Okay.

12:35.542 --> 12:39.250
-Here. Put it with the other.
-You have a patient waiting.

12:39.375 --> 12:40.792
Okay.

12:42.667 --> 12:44.292
Thanks.

12:48.667 --> 12:51.667
You have come to Dr. Green.
How can I help you?

12:53.458 --> 12:55.500
Loaf. And you are called?

12:57.083 --> 12:58.292
Okay.

13:10.583 --> 13:13.042
Are you currently working?

13:16.458 --> 13:20.208
Appropriate participants
receive a payment of $ 2500

14:03.833 --> 14:05.625
Breathe deeply.

14:15.375 --> 14:17.333
Breathe deeply.

14:21.667 --> 14:24.000
Okay. Breathe normally.

14:32.583 --> 14:34.083
Very good.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.042
I want to ask you to close your eyes
and turn your head to the left.

14:39.125 --> 14:42.083
I will check something and
will take you on my throat.

14:44.042 --> 14:45.333
Okay.

14:51.792 --> 14:54.667
Do you know that?
-Yes.

14:57.708 --> 14:59.167
Okay.

15:05.375 --> 15:06.375
Abrupt.

15:10.125 --> 15:12.917
There is nothing to prevent your
participation in the program.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.625
If you want, we can get started
now and give you the medicine.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.583
Okay. How long is the research study?

15:21.667 --> 15:26.292
One week. There may be two.
But do not think about it. We'll solve it.

15:26.375 --> 15:29.542
Okay. Some side effects I should know about?

15:29.625 --> 15:35.750
Yes, the effect of the tablets is reminiscent
of non-prescription sleeping medicines.

15:37.208 --> 15:39.542
You must refrain from alcohol.

15:39.625 --> 15:44.458
Take the pill before going to bed in the evening.
And report to us.

15:44.542 --> 15:47.583
We call and hear how everything goes.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.625
-Is that all?
-Yes.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.167
You're done.

15:54.125 --> 15:56.750
-Okay.
-Very good.

17:18.791 --> 17:21.000
A CAPTURE DAILY AT LEGAL TIME

17:36.875 --> 17:39.375
Make sure everyone is
dead before you leave.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.292
Ten.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.250
Nine.

19:40.333 --> 19:41.583
Eight.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.917
Seven.

19:47.750 --> 19:49.042
Six.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.333
Five.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.542
Four.

19:56.625 --> 19:58.083
Miss Watson.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Three.

20:02.583 --> 20:04.000
Two.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.208
Miss Watson.

20:06.292 --> 20:07.458
One.

20:35.708 --> 20:39.500
DAY 2

20:49.250 --> 20:53.667
It's just a change of your
cognitive function. It is...

20:55.125 --> 20:57.292
... just a dream.

20:57.375 --> 20:59.208
It's hard to decide.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.750
-I drank a splash of whiskey before...
-Whisky?

21:02.792 --> 21:05.375
I did not ask you to drink alcohol.

21:06.833 --> 21:10.042
Yes I know. Pardon.
It will not happen again.

21:12.208 --> 21:17.708
Abrupt. Continue with the tablets.
And do as we say.

21:19.250 --> 21:24.125
And... If you dream like
that again, call me.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.417
Ok?

21:27.625 --> 21:32.208
Listen here... These are serious things.
Do you understand that?

21:34.833 --> 21:37.417
Yes. I understand.

21:42.750 --> 21:45.208
Can I ask about something before I go?
-Yes.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.542
When I was in the waiting room yesterday,
there was another patient there.

21:50.333 --> 21:55.417
A man. He looked terrible.
He had a mark on...

21:55.500 --> 21:57.875
-I was worried...
One of my common patients.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.750
It has no connection to you.

21:59.833 --> 22:04.625
It is completely unrelated.
You have nothing to worry about.

22:05.417 --> 22:06.875
Ok?

22:07.792 --> 22:09.792
So do as we say.

22:09.875 --> 22:14.167
Follow the instructions, then everything goes well.

22:20.042 --> 22:21.208
Ok?

22:30.125 --> 22:31.125
Okay.

22:37.042 --> 22:38.667
Where did you find them?

22:42.375 --> 22:44.667
What do you know more about this doctor?

22:46.750 --> 22:50.375
That was the one I took.
That's what they gave me.

22:51.625 --> 22:52.667
Whose?

22:54.125 --> 22:59.292
I just said that. Dr. Green.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.500
Abrupt. Who is this doctor?

23:07.083 --> 23:09.000
Tell.

23:34.458 --> 23:36.250
Hello.

23:39.292 --> 23:41.167
I did not see you.

23:49.583 --> 23:54.875
DAY 3

27:13.167 --> 27:15.667
Brian: I'm here.
Iris: And the neighbor?

27:18.375 --> 27:20.292
Brian: I took care of him.

27:22.250 --> 27:23.792
Iris: Good job.

27:33.458 --> 27:36.208
Brian: When do I get the money?

27:37.792 --> 27:40.000
Iris: When the job is completed.

27:49.792 --> 27:51.875
Yes! Wait!

27:54.000 --> 27:55.750
Yes.

28:02.625 --> 28:05.167
Can I help you with something?

28:06.583 --> 28:08.750
Hello? Can I help you?

28:12.083 --> 28:13.458
What is wrong with you?

28:52.750 --> 28:54.292
Excuse me.

29:31.167 --> 29:33.000
Brian: Okay.

29:34.500 --> 29:35.292
Iris has left the chat

31:29.875 --> 31:31.333
Eight.

31:33.750 --> 31:35.250
Seven.

31:38.375 --> 31:39.833
Six.

31:42.208 --> 31:44.000
Five.

31:46.125 --> 31:48.167
Four.

31:50.708 --> 31:52.083
Three.

32:14.750 --> 32:19.042
DAY 4

33:23.833 --> 33:25.333
Pardon.

33:26.583 --> 33:30.042
My name is Brian.
I live next to you.

33:30.125 --> 33:32.458
You're newly relocated, right?

33:32.542 --> 33:35.292
Yes, my name is April.

33:40.458 --> 33:43.292
You must lift and wriggle on it.

33:48.458 --> 33:50.250
Thanks.

35:20.833 --> 35:22.333
Help.

35:25.833 --> 35:28.292
Help me.

37:30.083 --> 37:31.792
Four.

37:34.417 --> 37:36.000
Three.

37:38.292 --> 37:39.833
Two.

37:42.875 --> 37:44.583
One.

38:02.458 --> 38:04.083
Help!

38:58.875 --> 39:03.000
DAY 5

41:35.500 --> 41:39.458
NOT PREGNANT

42:30.208 --> 42:33.917
You know the rest. Why do not
you tell me what happened?

42:36.292 --> 42:39.167
You're the suspect, Miss Watson.

42:44.125 --> 42:47.042
I'm not saying any more to you.

42:52.042 --> 42:54.333
You're the suspect.

43:01.667 --> 43:02.833
Continue to chat.

43:27.542 --> 43:30.667
Brian: I can not do this anymore

43:30.750 --> 43:33.250
Iris: Is there any problem?

43:39.833 --> 43:42.375
Brian: It does not feel right

43:43.583 --> 43:46.292
Iris: We have a deal, right?

43:50.750 --> 43:54.000
Brian:
I've done my part, I finish

43:55.292 --> 43:59.250
Brian: I give you the rest personally

43:59.333 --> 44:01.167
Iris: one hour

44:01.250 --> 44:02.250
Iris has left the chat

44:31.667 --> 44:33.292
Hello?

46:58.667 --> 47:00.333
Okay.

47:09.167 --> 47:11.875
These are very serious things.

47:21.333 --> 47:23.250
You must understand that.

47:25.042 --> 47:27.125
Do you understand?

48:18.792 --> 48:20.458
Ten.

48:24.750 --> 48:26.250
Nine.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.458
Eight.

48:32.875 --> 48:34.250
Seven.

48:36.833 --> 48:38.125
Six.

48:40.833 --> 48:42.292
Five.

48:44.667 --> 48:46.125
Four.

48:48.750 --> 48:50.167
Three.

48:52.750 --> 48:54.000
Two.

48:55.625 --> 48:58.875
Two...

49:44.417 --> 49:46.500
I asked you to stay away from alcohol.

49:57.625 --> 50:02.417
Miss Watson, is this really?
Or do you dream?

50:14.000 --> 50:17.417
What the hell is going on?
-Is this really or do you dream?

50:26.083 --> 50:28.292
What is it like...?

50:28.375 --> 50:32.833
Is this included in the study?
Is it a kind of sick test?

50:33.833 --> 50:39.208
I do not want to be with more.
Please...

50:42.417 --> 50:44.833
Do not you want to be with more?

50:54.708 --> 50:56.792
Miss Watson...

50:56.875 --> 51:00.958
Is this reality...

51:01.042 --> 51:05.042
Please...

51:59.583 --> 52:01.333
Shit!

53:54.833 --> 53:56.792
Did you ask someone for help?

53:59.125 --> 54:01.042
Your husband, maybe?

54:05.458 --> 54:09.083
Listen...
I have to ask you to concentrate.

54:12.667 --> 54:16.000
-Answer.
-I do not understand the point.

54:21.417 --> 54:24.417
You will do that. Believe me.

54:28.417 --> 54:30.500
Why did you take his weapon?

56:51.375 --> 56:52.875
-Hello?
-Hi.

56:54.000 --> 56:59.333
April? What...? I'm sleeping.
What time is it?

57:03.542 --> 57:07.583
Someone just tried to kill me.
I need your help.

57:08.583 --> 57:10.792
Okay. Now it's okay. It's four if...

57:11.500 --> 57:14.125
Please, this is not about us.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.250
I destroyed it. Ok?

57:19.500 --> 57:24.042
I get it. Ok?
Just come back...

57:25.375 --> 57:28.750
You must put in a coin.

57:28.833 --> 57:30.125
Please add...

57:36.750 --> 57:39.125
...a coin.
Try calling again...

58:51.125 --> 58:52.833
Ok, I took the tablets.

58:57.833 --> 59:00.583
I'll tell them everything. The doctor...

59:01.917 --> 59:05.458
A cassette player... It was broken.
It recurred. Broken...

59:06.500 --> 59:08.542
I hit that man.

59:09.833 --> 59:13.125
Two. Two...

59:16.000 --> 59:20.917
My name is Brian. I live next to you.
You're newly relocated, right?

59:57.417 --> 59:59.458
Open the next door.
Fuck.

01:00:00.792 --> 01:00:02.292
-Only...
-Quiet.

01:00:02.375 --> 01:00:04.333
Open the next door.

01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:12.417
You must lift and wriggle on it.

01:01:38.458 --> 01:01:40.292
Come with me.

01:01:45.667 --> 01:01:47.000
What?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.375
-We are in.
-Oppfattet.

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:54.000
What is it?

01:02:06.292 --> 01:02:07.750
The suspect moves.

01:02:32.333 --> 01:02:34.125
Stay where you are.

01:02:36.625 --> 01:02:38.250
Permission to intervene.

01:02:39.375 --> 01:02:41.000
Wait!

01:02:42.833 --> 01:02:44.333
Dirt!

01:02:57.542 --> 01:02:59.333
Do not shoot!

01:02:59.417 --> 01:03:01.667
He was hit in the leg.

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:03.583
I'm hit.

01:03:25.667 --> 01:03:27.625
Take my keys.

01:03:35.583 --> 01:03:37.375
It goes well.

01:03:51.875 --> 01:03:53.083
Hell.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.292
-Okay...
Fuck!

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.583
-I did not even get my money.
-Hush!

01:05:34.042 --> 01:05:35.250
April...

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:39.000
I'm sorry for it, April.

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:41.875
I'm sorry.

01:05:43.667 --> 01:05:46.042
Put your hands here.

01:07:36.333 --> 01:07:39.625
Hi, this is April Watson.
I'm not in...

01:08:04.292 --> 01:08:05.417
Nobody here

01:08:27.625 --> 01:08:32.082
DAY 6

01:08:34.332 --> 01:08:35.875
Listen...

01:08:38.042 --> 01:08:39.792
We have a bad time.

01:08:44.332 --> 01:08:46.167
Come on!

01:08:52.167 --> 01:08:54.332
You have to tell what happened.

01:08:57.332 --> 01:09:00.957
-What happened? Tell.
Keep yourself away from me.

01:09:01.042 --> 01:09:03.832
I am on your side. Try to remember.

01:09:11.542 --> 01:09:14.832
April... I have to hear from you.

01:09:15.542 --> 01:09:18.250
What happened?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.292
Try to remember.

01:11:47.833 --> 01:11:49.625
What have I done?

01:11:51.250 --> 01:11:52.750
Three.

01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:55.708
Two.

01:11:57.292 --> 01:11:58.833
One.

01:12:04.708 --> 01:12:05.792
Help...

01:13:49.083 --> 01:13:52.500
No, can not have...
I have not done this.

01:13:53.542 --> 01:13:55.625
I have not done this.

01:15:09.375 --> 01:15:11.000
I will check something and
will take you on my throat.

01:15:14.625 --> 01:15:16.125
The chip.

01:15:21.375 --> 01:15:22.875
The chip?

01:15:36.083 --> 01:15:37.583
Stop.

01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:42.625
It's enough. Stop.

01:15:46.917 --> 01:15:49.208
Stop, I said!

01:15:53.125 --> 01:15:55.083
Stop! It's enough!

01:16:42.292 --> 01:16:44.000
April...

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.250
This doctor...

01:16:51.417 --> 01:16:53.167
Do you remember how he looks?

01:17:00.458 --> 01:17:02.000
Abrupt.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.333
Okay.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.708
Put this on.
You have lost a lot of blood.

01:17:18.125 --> 01:17:22.292
Now we can do something.
I'll talk to someone else about it.

01:17:23.083 --> 01:17:26.167
-Okay. Thanks.
-Okay.

01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:31.083
-We will get you out of here. Ok?
-Thanks.

01:18:13.625 --> 01:18:16.333
I do not understand
how, but she does.

01:18:18.208 --> 01:18:21.042
She thinks that the whole
operation has all happened.

01:18:21.125 --> 01:18:23.875
You must wash all the blood.
Joe, is she nervous?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.125
-Pers she heavily?
-He is exhausted.

01:18:26.208 --> 01:18:28.167
- Are the pupils expanded?
-Yes.

01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:31.833
-Hell.
-He believes that everything has already happened.

01:18:56.125 --> 01:19:00.625
Go in there and put on her handcuffs.
Say it's a formality. Ok?

01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:04.792
After that I come in and
pump her petidin, so...

01:19:12.583 --> 01:19:13.917
There you go.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.833
Do you think we were talking about this? Aim...
- Do not come closer.

01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:22.042
Wait. Do you remember what we said?
That you should aim for him?

01:19:23.875 --> 01:19:28.250
You would not aim at me?
It's him we want to take, right? He.

01:19:30.125 --> 01:19:31.833
Correct it against him, not me.

01:19:35.542 --> 01:19:37.292
- Do not come closer.
-Calm. Do you remember?

01:19:37.375 --> 01:19:41.167
Five, four, three, two, one.

01:19:42.167 --> 01:19:43.208
Did you see?

01:19:45.667 --> 01:19:46.917
Ok?

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.375
Put it down
Take it easy. Put down the gun.

01:19:50.458 --> 01:19:53.333
You have to put down the gun.
Now. Do as I say!

01:19:53.417 --> 01:19:55.208
Put down the gun!

01:19:58.542 --> 01:20:00.083
Four.

01:20:02.417 --> 01:20:03.375
Three.

01:20:06.125 --> 01:20:07.167
Two.

01:20:11.083 --> 01:20:12.333
One.

01:21:51.833 --> 01:21:58.875
HIGHEST ALARM LEVEL
AFTER TERROR PLAN

01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:07.625
TERROR REPRODUCTION AVERAGE

01:22:09.042 --> 01:22:11.792
FALSE RESEARCH STUDY
HARDWASHS PARTICIPANTS

01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:24.000
Inoperated microchips ruled
suspected terrorists

01:22:32.708 --> 01:22:35.625
April Watson, who despised the
attack, remembers information.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:45.000
The prosecution jury determines
the fatalities of the terrorists

01:22:52.542 --> 01:22:58.750
MANY QUESTIONS REMAIN

01:24:25.542 --> 01:24:29.083
Are you coming to town tonight?
-Yes.

01:24:30.250 --> 01:24:31.583
ONE YEAR LATER

01:24:31.667 --> 01:24:34.667
-Not too late.
-Relax.

01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:40.208
-How does it go with the therapy?
-It takes time, but it helps.

01:24:40.292 --> 01:24:45.375
-Are you coming?
-I finish at work six, so...

01:24:46.375 --> 01:24:48.667
-You are coming.
-Yes.

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:51.417
-Okay. Then we will hear later.
-Good bye.

01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:04.125
Hello?

01:25:04.208 --> 01:25:05.917
Three.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Two.

01:25:08.083 --> 01:25:10.000
One.
