00:08.841 --> 00:11.174
Larry David is back
in the news again.

00:11.257 --> 00:12.841
That's right, the co-creator
of  Seinfeld

00:12.924 --> 00:14.841
has returned
to his contentious ways,

00:14.924 --> 00:16.924
this time in the retail arena.

00:17.007 --> 00:19.299
Here's NBC's Josh Mankiewicz
with more.

00:19.382 --> 00:21.924
Look, we've
all experienced
bad service before,

00:22.007 --> 00:24.257
but for most of us,
there's not much
you can do about it.

00:24.341 --> 00:26.049
Maybe write a negative
Yelp review,

00:26.132 --> 00:28.174
or maybe you just don't
go back to the place.

00:28.257 --> 00:31.257
But Larry David has chosen
a different path.

00:31.341 --> 00:33.132
This is Mocha Joe's,

00:33.215 --> 00:36.507
a small coffee shop
serving the Westside
of Los Angeles,

00:36.591 --> 00:39.174
and this is Latte Larry's.

00:39.257 --> 00:41.799
Why two coffee shops
right next to each other?

00:41.883 --> 00:44.674
We went to the man himself
for answers.

00:44.758 --> 00:46.924
I was wronged.
I was mistreated.

00:47.007 --> 00:49.007
I ordered a cup
of coffee next door,

00:49.090 --> 00:52.049
at this Mocha Joe's,
and, Josh,

00:52.132 --> 00:54.424
the coffee is cold.

00:54.507 --> 00:57.549
I politely asked for
another cup of coffee.

00:57.633 --> 01:00.132
He banned me from the store.
I couldn't live with it.

01:00.215 --> 01:03.007
So you're operating this place
just out of spite?

01:03.090 --> 01:05.382
Yeah.
It's a spite store.

01:05.466 --> 01:08.049
I called him an old, bald nut.
I mean, I cop to that.

01:08.132 --> 01:09.466
But the guy comes in here,

01:09.549 --> 01:11.132
complains about the tables,
complains about the coffee.

01:11.215 --> 01:12.716
Do you have
wobbly tables?

01:12.799 --> 01:14.883
Eh, one or two.
But what's the big deal?
You put your foot on it.

01:14.965 --> 01:16.507
Nobody else is complaining.

01:16.591 --> 01:17.965
If he apologized,

01:18.049 --> 01:20.382
would you get out of
the coffee business?

01:20.466 --> 01:22.591
If it was a deep,
heartfelt apology,

01:22.674 --> 01:24.633
with maybe a little tear--

01:24.716 --> 01:27.466
"Larry, my scones
are like muffins."

01:27.549 --> 01:29.090
That would have to be
included, of course.

01:29.174 --> 01:32.049
Okay, Larry says that
if you would just apologize...

01:32.132 --> 01:34.174
-(laughs)
-...he could get out
of business.

01:34.257 --> 01:36.965
Apologize? Me? Never.
A ban is a ban.

01:37.049 --> 01:39.382
You ever think that
maybe the problem is,

01:39.466 --> 01:40.799
you were complaining
too much?

01:40.883 --> 01:43.841
I don't like
to tear people down.
I want to help.

01:43.924 --> 01:45.758
Look, this pocket square
you got going, there,

01:45.841 --> 01:47.257
it looks out of place.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.174
That's for some
English dandy.

01:49.257 --> 01:50.424
It's not
for a journalist.

01:50.507 --> 01:51.924
You don't think
that's kind of insulting?

01:52.007 --> 01:53.549
No, not in the least.

01:53.633 --> 01:56.424
Hey, if you told me
you didn't like
my jacket or something,

01:56.507 --> 01:57.841
well, I,
I wouldn't care.

01:57.924 --> 02:00.466
Actually, I, I really
don't like your jacket.

02:01.049 --> 02:02.549
Oh, is that so?

02:02.633 --> 02:06.299
And while Larry was
the first to open
a spite store,

02:06.382 --> 02:08.924
he's since started a trend
here in Hollywood,

02:09.007 --> 02:11.174
with other celebrities
following suit,

02:11.257 --> 02:12.591
like Jonah Hill,

02:12.674 --> 02:15.007
who's now operating
a spite deli.

02:15.090 --> 02:16.924
Hill: So, you know,
I used to go to Irv's Deli,

02:17.007 --> 02:19.090
right next door,
two, three times a week.

02:19.716 --> 02:22.466
And I found a hair
in my sandwich.

02:22.549 --> 02:23.965
-Not your hair?
-No.

02:24.049 --> 02:26.215
This was a gray hair.
It wasn't my hair.

02:26.299 --> 02:28.466
And this guy Irv's going,
"Oh, it's yours."

02:28.549 --> 02:30.174
And I'm, like,
what can I do, you know?

02:30.257 --> 02:33.007
I, I can't sleep.
I'm taking four or five
Ambien to get to sleep,

02:33.090 --> 02:34.924
'cause all I see is
this guy Irv's face.

02:35.007 --> 02:39.007
-So what changed?
-What changed was
I had seen Latte Larry's.

02:39.090 --> 02:41.007
The idea of a spite store's
such a brilliant idea.

02:41.090 --> 02:42.382
I'm gonna open
a spite deli.

02:42.466 --> 02:44.215
Mankiewicz:
What started off with spite

02:44.299 --> 02:46.633
has now become
a passion project.

02:46.716 --> 02:48.424
Thanks for dining
with us.

02:49.049 --> 02:50.591
Three dollars?

02:50.674 --> 02:54.049
And you're turning down
acting and directing gigs
for this?

02:54.132 --> 02:55.382
What's left for me
in Hollywood?

02:55.466 --> 02:57.466
Win some award
or something, you know?

02:57.549 --> 03:00.591
Any time I see a customer
walk in here that used to
go to Irv's,

03:00.674 --> 03:04.215
it's like my own tiny little
human Oscar walking in here.

03:04.299 --> 03:05.507
So this is your life now?

03:05.591 --> 03:06.674
I might actually open

03:06.758 --> 03:07.924
a spite deli out in New York.

03:08.007 --> 03:10.424
There was a spot
on 42nd Street

03:10.507 --> 03:13.341
that was a bit disrespectful
that I'm looking at taking out.

03:13.424 --> 03:17.507
Jonah Hill is not
the only celebrity
with spite on his mind.

03:17.591 --> 03:19.799
This is Ray's Exotic Birds,

03:19.883 --> 03:21.841
and this is Sean's.

03:21.924 --> 03:23.466
It's become the place

03:23.549 --> 03:27.049
to get a macaw,
or a hummingbird nester.

03:27.132 --> 03:30.174
-(birds squawking)
-I had always wanted
a talking bird.

03:30.257 --> 03:31.841
So I go to Ray,

03:31.924 --> 03:33.841
just next door,

03:33.924 --> 03:35.841
and he sells me the bird.

03:35.965 --> 03:38.674
And the bird doesn't talk.
It just sort of grunts.

03:38.758 --> 03:41.507
So I go back to return it.
He says, "No returns."

03:41.591 --> 03:43.257
I said, "Bullshit."

03:43.341 --> 03:45.758
'Cause he knew,
he knew it was a mute bird.

03:45.841 --> 03:48.549
And I'm on a kind
of slow burn,

03:48.633 --> 03:50.341
not knowing
quite what to do.

03:50.424 --> 03:52.799
Then Larry opens up
the coffee place,

03:52.883 --> 03:55.174
and it was like,
ding, ding, ding.

03:55.257 --> 03:57.674
Sean's Exotic Birds.

03:57.758 --> 03:59.716
It put Ray right
out of business.

03:59.799 --> 04:03.257
Here, this is
a hyacinth macaw,
from Brazil.

04:03.341 --> 04:04.674
Would you like
to hold him?

04:04.758 --> 04:05.758
Sure.

04:05.841 --> 04:07.299
Does all the time
you're spending here

04:07.382 --> 04:09.215
take away from,
you know, acting?

04:09.299 --> 04:13.132
I was never a very,
Zen sort of personality,

04:13.215 --> 04:16.132
but I find myself very,
very calm now.

04:16.215 --> 04:18.132
I think, you know,
it's the birds.

04:18.215 --> 04:20.257
-(loud squawk)
-(screams): Shut up!

04:20.341 --> 04:21.382
(squawks)

04:21.466 --> 04:22.716
So the next time you see

04:22.799 --> 04:25.799
two similar stores
right next to each other,

04:25.883 --> 04:30.090
there's a pretty good chance
one of 'em's doing it
out of spite.

04:30.174 --> 04:32.424
Savannah and Hoda,
back to you.

04:32.507 --> 04:34.674
(theme music playing)

04:43.965 --> 04:45.883
-Larry: Aah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Seiderman:
It hurts right there?

04:45.965 --> 04:48.549
-Now we're gonna bend it.
-Anyway, the guy in
the motorized wheelchair,

04:48.633 --> 04:50.257
he's on line at my store--

04:50.341 --> 04:51.924
-Aah, that's plenty. Yeah.
-Right there. Okay.

04:52.007 --> 04:54.591
And all of a sudden,
he gets beep panic,

04:54.674 --> 04:56.591
-and rolls right into me.
-Seiderman:
Unbelievable.

04:56.674 --> 04:59.132
Okay, so here's the bottom line
with your knee. Okay?

04:59.215 --> 05:01.382
-Larry: Yeah.
-You have a tear
in your meniscus.

05:01.466 --> 05:04.049
You know, if you want to fix
this thing once and for all,
you need surgery.

05:04.132 --> 05:05.591
-Uh-huh.
-All right? I go in there,

05:05.674 --> 05:07.965
I, uh, I repair the tear
in your meniscus,

05:08.049 --> 05:09.507
you're back home
the very same day.

05:09.591 --> 05:10.716
You'll be in bed
for about a week.

05:10.799 --> 05:12.633
Okay, then we'll get
you on crutches.

05:12.716 --> 05:14.841
Then after about two months
of intensive everyday rehab,

05:14.924 --> 05:16.965
you'll be back to normal,
good as new.

05:17.049 --> 05:19.049
-How does that sound?
-Not so great.

05:19.132 --> 05:20.591
You could do
other techniques,
but you're gonna be

05:20.674 --> 05:23.007
right back in this chair
in a few months, I guarantee it.

05:24.591 --> 05:27.174
What if I got a...

05:27.257 --> 05:29.215
second opinion?

05:29.883 --> 05:31.799
-Why?
-Just to see...

05:31.883 --> 05:34.090
what somebody else
might have to say about it.

05:34.174 --> 05:35.924
If you want to get
a second opinion,
by all means.

05:36.007 --> 05:38.215
It's your right.
I encourage it.

05:38.299 --> 05:40.591
Oh, okay.
So we're cool, then?

05:41.049 --> 05:42.883
Yeah, Larry.
I'm cool.

05:42.965 --> 05:45.007
Get your second opinion.
Let me know how it goes.

05:45.090 --> 05:46.758
You know, a lot of people
are gonna say to me,

05:46.841 --> 05:48.049
"You should get
a second opinion."

05:48.132 --> 05:50.341
So I can say, "Yeah.
I got a second opinion."

05:50.424 --> 05:52.382
So it's just so you can
tell your friends you did it.

05:52.466 --> 05:53.924
It's not even saying it
to my friends.

05:54.007 --> 05:55.507
It's saying it
to my late mother.

05:55.591 --> 05:57.716
Okay, while here in my head,

05:57.799 --> 05:58.965
"Larry, what are you doing?

05:59.049 --> 06:01.132
Get a second opinion.
Are you stupid?"

06:01.215 --> 06:03.132
-Why do I need to hear that?
-Yeah, you don't wanna
hear that.

06:03.215 --> 06:06.507
-No. Even though she's dead,
I need to shut her up.
-Got it. All right.

06:06.591 --> 06:09.090
-Um, you can validate
your parking up front, there.
-(clattering)

06:09.174 --> 06:10.883
Careful. Uh...

06:13.591 --> 06:14.799
Hey!

06:15.007 --> 06:16.633
-Larry!
-Larry: Joey!

06:16.716 --> 06:18.549
-How's it going?
-Not terrible.

06:18.633 --> 06:20.174
How's your, uh,
coffee shop doing?

06:20.257 --> 06:21.924
-Doing quite well.
-Really?

06:22.007 --> 06:25.257
-Yeah.
-You lookin' for, uh,
you know, any people?

06:25.341 --> 06:28.299
-You're looking for--
-I, I am. I've been really
unhappy where I am,

06:28.382 --> 06:30.716
-and I'm looking
for something new.
-Joey.

06:30.799 --> 06:33.257
-You think I'm gonna
turn down a Funkhouser?
-Larry!

06:33.341 --> 06:35.382
-Yeah, of course. Come on.
-Yeah, that'd be great.

06:35.466 --> 06:38.007
Thank you, really. Terrific.
I can't wait to start.

06:38.090 --> 06:41.382
-All right, well, maybe even,
uh, maybe even tomorrow.
-Perfect.

06:41.466 --> 06:42.841
-Joey?
-Mm?

06:42.924 --> 06:44.299
What's going on
over here?

06:44.382 --> 06:46.965
Oh, I'm just waiting
for it to get hot.

06:47.049 --> 06:48.716
You're waiting
for it to get hot?

06:48.799 --> 06:51.382
-I don't think you
respect the drought.
-I do respect the drought.

06:51.466 --> 06:53.299
-Do you respect
the drought, Joey?
-I do. I really do.

06:53.382 --> 06:55.674
I do respect the drought. I--

06:55.758 --> 06:57.633
-Whoa.
-What?

06:57.716 --> 06:58.716
What?

06:58.799 --> 07:01.132
-Woo! Whoa!
-Okay.

07:01.215 --> 07:02.591
Joey!

07:02.674 --> 07:03.799
Larry.

07:03.883 --> 07:04.924
Yikes.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.591
I mean, I support
your transitioning,

07:06.674 --> 07:09.507
but you gave yourself
quite a large penis there.

07:09.591 --> 07:11.215
Yeah, I wanted to,

07:11.299 --> 07:15.257
you know, follow in
the Funkhouser tradition
of penises.

07:15.341 --> 07:16.841
Can you handle, uh,
something like that?

07:16.924 --> 07:19.466
-That's, that's enormous.
-It is, yeah.

07:19.549 --> 07:22.090
But, I mean,
it seems like a lot
to, to lug around.

07:22.174 --> 07:24.424
-No, it isn't actually.
-But--

07:24.507 --> 07:26.341
You've tried it out
on some dames?

07:26.424 --> 07:29.591
-I've had no complaints
about it. No complaints.
-No complaints.

07:29.674 --> 07:31.215
Okay. All right.

07:31.299 --> 07:33.591
-Enjoy your big penis.
-(laughs): I am.

07:33.674 --> 07:37.049
-And, uh, you know,
go to town with it.
-Thank you, Larry. That's--

07:37.132 --> 07:38.674
-We'll be in touch
about the store.
-Yeah. I'll call--

07:38.758 --> 07:40.507
I'll call you,
and you just let me know

07:40.591 --> 07:42.549
-when I can start.
I can't wait.
-Larry: Fantastic.

07:42.633 --> 07:45.174
-All right.
Thank you, Larry. Okay.
-Excited to have you.

07:47.090 --> 07:50.341
-Larry: Hey! Whoa!
-Look who I brought.

07:50.424 --> 07:52.549
-Country club shit
right here.
-Yeah.

07:52.633 --> 07:54.466
How you, uh, doing?
What's going on?

07:54.549 --> 07:58.090
Uh, I just saw
Joey Funkhouser's
new penis.

07:58.174 --> 08:00.299
-Who?
-Jeff: Marty Funkhouser's
daughter

08:00.382 --> 08:02.299
has transitioned
into being a man.

08:02.382 --> 08:03.507
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah.

08:03.591 --> 08:07.007
Had the surgery,
and, uh, it's big.

08:07.090 --> 08:08.341
-Leon: Mm.
-How big?

08:08.424 --> 08:10.132
-Really big.
-Wow.

08:10.215 --> 08:12.633
Yeah. He gave himself
a giant penis.

08:12.716 --> 08:14.299
-Did you see
the balls?
-No.

08:14.382 --> 08:17.132
Completely taken with the penis
that I didn't get to, you know,

08:17.215 --> 08:18.841
look at the scrotum at all.

08:18.924 --> 08:21.466
So wait a minute.
This is what happens
at country clubs?

08:21.549 --> 08:23.633
White guys walking around
showing each other their
johnson?

08:23.716 --> 08:25.549
No, no, no.
I saw it in the bathroom.

08:25.633 --> 08:26.716
He was wearing
a terrycloth robe.

08:26.799 --> 08:28.174
He turned
and the robe opened up.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.841
People don't tie robes properly.

08:29.924 --> 08:33.007
-Jeff: They do not.
-They're very cavalier
about a robe, you know?

08:33.090 --> 08:35.132
You can't just fling
one side over the other.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.924
-Cinch your robe.
-Cinch your robe.

08:37.007 --> 08:38.758
-Leon: Right.
-I don't see how he can wear
underwear with that thing.

08:38.841 --> 08:40.841
It's so big there's no way
he can fit in underwear.

08:40.924 --> 08:42.341
-You can't.
-Right?

08:42.424 --> 08:44.591
Everybody in the big johnson
community knows that.

08:44.674 --> 08:46.883
You can't wear underwear.
I don't wear underwear.

08:46.965 --> 08:49.341
-Larry: There's
a big johnson community?
-Of course there is.

08:49.424 --> 08:53.007
We meet once a month.
We talk about the pitfalls
of having a big-ass johnson.

08:53.090 --> 08:55.007
I've had several at the house.

08:55.090 --> 08:58.341
You... You've had
a big johnson meeting
at, at the house?

08:58.424 --> 09:00.965
When you're fuckin' out of town,
the whole community
shows the fuck up,

09:01.049 --> 09:03.633
and we sit around the table,
and just talk.

09:03.716 --> 09:05.674
-Do you have officers?
-Fuck, yeah, we do.

09:05.758 --> 09:07.257
Who's the president?

09:07.341 --> 09:09.841
My man,
Horse Cock Williams.

09:09.965 --> 09:12.215
Look, I don't have
a big penis,

09:12.299 --> 09:15.507
but I'd like to see if I could
join the big johnson community.

09:15.591 --> 09:17.758
How are you getting in
the big johnson community

09:17.841 --> 09:19.132
without a big johnson?
What--

09:19.215 --> 09:21.257
I know somebody there
who could vouch for me.

09:21.341 --> 09:23.424
What do you mean,
vouch for you? They, they,
they gotta look at it!

09:23.507 --> 09:25.924
You can't just show up.
You gotta flash that
motherfucker at the door.

09:26.007 --> 09:28.924
-Yeah. See?
-Well, what happens
if I get caught?

09:29.007 --> 09:30.841
They'll throw you out of there
by your little-ass johnson.

09:30.924 --> 09:33.090
Larry:
But maybe this would be
a good thing for Joey,

09:33.174 --> 09:35.965
because it's way too big,
and he can't handle it.

09:36.466 --> 09:38.466
I foresee...

09:38.549 --> 09:41.758
big problems with that penis.

09:41.841 --> 09:43.215
Big.

09:43.299 --> 09:44.382
To be honest,
I always tell people

09:44.466 --> 09:45.716
they can fix up the house.
I don't--

09:45.799 --> 09:48.049
Hey, Larry!
(chuckling): Hey!

09:48.132 --> 09:50.549
Larry David. Hey.

09:50.633 --> 09:51.965
Great news.

09:52.049 --> 09:55.799
I am the listing agent
of the house next to yours.

09:55.883 --> 09:57.257
-Oh, really?
You're selling it?
-Yeah.

09:57.341 --> 10:00.049
Ka-ching! Ka-ching!
(chuckles)

10:00.132 --> 10:02.090
-Make some money
on that one, right?
-Yeah.

10:02.174 --> 10:04.090
Okay. You know,
I should buy it myself,

10:04.174 --> 10:05.758
so I can avoid
asshole neighbors.

10:05.841 --> 10:08.924
-(laughs) I like that.
-You, you would never
buy it, would you?

10:09.007 --> 10:11.633
It's a little bit out
of my, uh, prince range,
you know, right now.

10:11.716 --> 10:12.924
Oh. That's good.

10:13.007 --> 10:14.215
'Cause you're the
last person in the world

10:14.299 --> 10:15.841
I want living next door to me.

10:15.924 --> 10:17.758
Clients love me, Larry.

10:17.841 --> 10:20.382

10:20.466 --> 10:23.257

10:23.341 --> 10:26.174

10:32.382 --> 10:36.090

(chuckling)

10:53.716 --> 10:56.633
(indistinct chatter)

10:56.716 --> 10:58.424
-Mm-hmm.
-How's the coffee?

10:58.507 --> 10:59.965
-It's good.
-It's good.

11:00.049 --> 11:01.424
Yeah. Good. You know,

11:01.507 --> 11:03.924
it's interesting, 'cause,
uh, I was in my car earlier,

11:04.007 --> 11:06.215
and all of a sudden,
I hear a siren,

11:06.299 --> 11:08.132
and I look in
the rearview mirror

11:08.215 --> 11:09.924
and there's a fire truck
behind me, and I...

11:10.007 --> 11:12.633
Wow, a fire!
And I better get over
to the side of the road.

11:12.716 --> 11:14.424
Those guys are really
in a hurry.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.507
I pull over to the side
of the road, and it...
shwoo! goes past me.

11:17.591 --> 11:20.591
And then I pull in here,
and I see the fire truck.

11:21.341 --> 11:23.090
Where's the fire?

11:23.174 --> 11:25.174
-(fireman clears throat)
-Larry: Where...

11:25.257 --> 11:27.965
Where is the fire?

11:28.049 --> 11:29.841
-We needed coffee.
-Oh, oh.

11:29.924 --> 11:31.215
-We don't do it often.
-No.

11:31.299 --> 11:33.174
-Like, it's not
a frequent thing.
-Yeah, no.

11:33.257 --> 11:35.174
You abused your siren.

11:35.257 --> 11:37.841
-Abused our siren?
-You're siren abusers.

11:37.924 --> 11:41.132
I completely get it.
I had a handicapped
placard once.

11:41.215 --> 11:43.382
And I could only imagine
what it's like to have a siren.

11:43.466 --> 11:45.466
'Cause that handicapped placard,
that was fantastic.

11:45.549 --> 11:47.591
Enjoy the coffee.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.674
Hey!

11:49.758 --> 11:52.174
-Look at this.
Joey Funkhouser.
-Hey, Larry.

11:52.257 --> 11:53.507
-How you doing?
-Larry: Hey.

11:53.591 --> 11:54.965
-So have you
shown him the ropes?
-Joey: Yeah.

11:55.049 --> 11:56.507
-We're gettin'
it down. Yeah.
-Fast learner.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.382
-Oh, yeah?
-The only question I have is,

11:58.466 --> 11:59.965
where's the, uh,
the tip jar?

12:00.049 --> 12:01.549
Oh, no. No tip jar.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.466
-No tipping?
-No, that's,
that's demeaning.

12:03.549 --> 12:05.299
It turns us into...
beggars.

12:05.382 --> 12:07.883
-Yeah? You think?
-Yeah. We might as well be
outside with a, with a cup.

12:07.965 --> 12:10.049
-Uh-oh. Know
what happens now?
-It's a-- What?

12:10.132 --> 12:11.633
-No.
-(chuckles)

12:11.716 --> 12:13.341
-Ah. Look at that, see?
-Ah. (laughs)

12:13.424 --> 12:15.049
Oh, boy. This,
this is a big moment.

12:15.132 --> 12:16.591
-Joey: That's it?
-Leon: Oh, the big moment.
Yes, indeed.

12:16.674 --> 12:18.716
-Let's go to the back.
To the storeroom?
-Um-hmm.

12:18.799 --> 12:20.132
-And get changed there.
-Okay. Great. Right.

12:20.215 --> 12:22.007
Hey, as long as you're going
to the storeroom,

12:22.090 --> 12:25.049
-show him how to charge
the, uh, the self-heating cups.
-Leon: Yes, indeed.

12:25.132 --> 12:28.090
I kind of talked
Larry into putting up
"no lamping" signs

12:28.174 --> 12:30.466

or ever working for me,
or anything to do with me.

13:54.424 --> 13:58.257
So she suffered memory loss
from the choking on the scone?

13:58.341 --> 14:00.132

out of the lawsuit,

-Will: Yeah?
-Yeah.

14:30.090 --> 14:32.341
We broke up

told me that.

14:34.424 --> 14:36.132
-Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
-Jeff: Wow.

14:36.215 --> 14:37.591
Just so you know,
while you're here,

14:37.674 --> 14:39.382
-I don't know how
to deliver a baby.
-Okay.

14:39.466 --> 14:40.758
How do you,
how do you induce labor?

14:40.841 --> 14:42.424
Can you scare someone
into labor?

14:42.507 --> 14:43.841
-I don't know.
-Larry: Is that possible?

14:43.965 --> 14:45.382
-I--
-Uh, maybe it's possible.

14:45.466 --> 14:46.841
I think it's something
we want to avoid.

14:46.924 --> 14:47.965
Why would you
wanna do that?

14:48.049 --> 14:49.090
A baby should come

14:49.174 --> 14:50.591
when it's naturally
supposed to come.

14:50.674 --> 14:52.090
Who needs Mr. Buttinski
over here?

14:52.174 --> 14:54.049
It's a hypothetical.
It's just a hypothetical.

14:54.132 --> 14:56.716
Let's say you had a bet
with a friend.

14:56.799 --> 14:58.215
You see a pregnant woman
who, uh--

14:58.299 --> 14:59.633
big pregnant woman
walking down the street--

14:59.716 --> 15:01.591
you make a $50 bet
with this friend,

15:01.674 --> 15:03.174
that you can induce labor
by scaring her.

15:03.257 --> 15:05.049
You go into the bushes,
she's walking down the street,

15:05.132 --> 15:06.549
and all of a sudden
you jump out. Aah!

15:06.633 --> 15:08.758
-Uh, you in the bushes?
-Yeah.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.674
For 50 bucks
you're going
in the bushes?

15:10.758 --> 15:12.799
Yeah, but it's hypothetical.
See if you can induce labor.

15:12.883 --> 15:14.424
Well, what happens if
she goes into labor?

15:14.507 --> 15:15.549
-Yeah, what happens if you win?
-Susie: Yeah.

15:15.633 --> 15:16.883
I, I'd drive her
to the hospital.

15:16.965 --> 15:19.591
Okay, let's say you're
driving her to the hospital,

15:19.674 --> 15:21.633
and along the way
to the hospital,

15:21.716 --> 15:23.257
she starts giving birth

15:23.341 --> 15:25.007
-in your car?
-Well, that's a problem.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.299
You gotta really think
these hypotheticals out.

15:27.382 --> 15:28.924
'Cause they always
end poorly.

15:29.007 --> 15:30.257
Okay, I won't scare her.

15:30.341 --> 15:31.633
-Jeff: Okay.
-Susie: Yeah, thank you.

15:31.716 --> 15:33.841
So, I'm so glad you guys
finally came over.

15:33.924 --> 15:36.466
-Sorry we're late.
-Yeah, that's--
that's on me.

15:36.549 --> 15:38.883
I, you know, I refuse
to look at the phone,
and like,

15:38.965 --> 15:40.591
I try and go off the watch.
I forget,

15:40.674 --> 15:42.090
and it always, like,
runs a little late.

15:42.174 --> 15:43.841
-Tara: Yeah, hard to guess it.
-You can't get that fixed?

15:43.924 --> 15:45.883
I've tried,
but, you know,

15:45.965 --> 15:48.424
-it always just, like,
goes back, you know?
-I know a guy who can fix that,

15:48.507 --> 15:50.341
easily. He's, he's great.

15:50.424 --> 15:52.466
-You sure?
-K.L. Jeweler, yeah.

15:52.549 --> 15:53.883
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, really?

15:53.965 --> 15:55.633
I drive by there every day.
I can just bring it in.

15:55.716 --> 15:57.758
-Ah, all right. Yeah.
-That's so nice.

15:57.841 --> 15:58.965
I guarantee it.

15:59.049 --> 16:00.257
Yeah, it's my
grandfather's watch.

16:00.341 --> 16:01.424
Gave it to me, like,
right before he died.

16:01.507 --> 16:03.257
Oh, yeah?
You should get it fixed.

16:03.341 --> 16:04.841
And believe me,
if anybody can fix it,

16:04.924 --> 16:06.090
-it's this guy. He's great.
-Tara: Oh, good.

16:06.174 --> 16:07.341
-Will: I appreciate that.
-Susie: Aah!

16:07.424 --> 16:08.674
Where are my manners?

16:08.758 --> 16:09.924
You want something to drink?

16:10.007 --> 16:11.382
That would be great.
I'm, I'm...

16:11.466 --> 16:12.841
really craving ginger ale.

16:12.924 --> 16:14.466
-Oh, we have ginger ale.
Right, Jeff?
-Tara: Do you?

16:14.549 --> 16:17.382
I cannot stock up
enough ginger ale.
I love ginger ale.

16:17.466 --> 16:19.591
Hey, how 'bout--
I'll get in on the ginger ale.

16:19.674 --> 16:22.299
-You sure you got enough?
-Oh, no, we have tons
of ginger ale.

16:22.382 --> 16:23.716
Susie:
Two ginger ales,
Jeffrey.

16:23.799 --> 16:25.257
-Thank you, Jeff.
Thank you.
-Thank you.

16:25.341 --> 16:27.758
So, um, do you know
the sex of the,
of the child?

16:27.841 --> 16:29.549
We're gonna have
a little baby boy.

16:29.633 --> 16:31.633
-Larry: A little baby boy.
How about that?
-Susie: Oh, so cute! Yeah.

16:31.716 --> 16:34.799
Have you thought
about the, um,
the skin color at all?

16:34.883 --> 16:36.924
-I'm sorry?
-Larry: You know.
The tone?

16:37.007 --> 16:39.466
Would you prefer it's,
it's a, it's a little darker?

16:39.549 --> 16:41.799
I would imagine you might
prefer it to be a little darker,

16:41.883 --> 16:43.257
as opposed to lighter, no?

16:43.341 --> 16:45.007
Well, I mean,
I've never even
thought about it.

16:45.090 --> 16:47.799
-Larry: Huh.
-But, I guess like,
darker, I guess.

16:47.883 --> 16:49.674
-Larry: Yeah,
I would think. Right?
-What?

16:49.758 --> 16:50.883
Yeah, that makes sense.

16:50.965 --> 16:52.549
-(laughs) Uh, I...
-What?

16:52.633 --> 16:54.174
-You'd prefer him to be darker?
-Prefer it--

16:54.257 --> 16:55.965
I mean, if someone's asking me,
like, if I had to choose,

16:56.049 --> 16:57.424
-I'd say, like darker.
-Why are you choosing?

16:57.507 --> 16:59.382
You'd probably like it
a little lighter maybe, no?

16:59.466 --> 17:01.841
Tara:
No, I, I don't,
I don't think

17:01.924 --> 17:03.549
I want my baby to be lighter.

17:03.633 --> 17:05.299
I haven't thought
about that at all.

17:05.382 --> 17:07.007
-I'm surprised that
you've thought about it.
-Oh, yeah.

17:07.090 --> 17:09.299
I mean, well, I,
I hadn't thought about it,

17:09.382 --> 17:10.549
but asked the question,
I mean--

17:10.633 --> 17:12.341
I know, but what you
could have said,

17:12.424 --> 17:13.633
I don't have a preference,

17:13.716 --> 17:15.424
but you said you'd
prefer him to be darker.

17:15.507 --> 17:17.341
-You don't have
a preference at all?
-No, I don't have a preference.

17:17.424 --> 17:19.215
Say somebody put
a gun to your head.

17:19.299 --> 17:22.007
Said, "Do you want you baby
to be lighter or darker?"

17:22.090 --> 17:23.424
What would you choose?

17:23.507 --> 17:26.090
Why is someone holding
a gun to my head
and asking me

17:26.174 --> 17:29.341
-what shade I would prefer
my son to be?
-It's a hypothetical.

17:29.424 --> 17:31.549
-Larry: I don't know, see--
-Why is somebody putting
a gun to her head?

17:31.633 --> 17:34.090
He wants to--
He wants to find out
what your preference is.

17:34.174 --> 17:36.174
So you're walking
down the street with Will,

17:36.257 --> 17:38.132
and he snatches you into
the backseat of the car,

17:38.215 --> 17:39.382
and now he's got
a gun to your head.

17:39.466 --> 17:41.257
"Do you want a lighter
or a darker baby?

17:41.341 --> 17:43.382
-What shade? What shade?"
-Get away from me!

17:43.466 --> 17:44.799
What color is the guy
holding the gun?

17:44.883 --> 17:46.215
He's mocha.
Right down the middle.

17:46.299 --> 17:47.799
-Will: Right down the middle.
-Fifty-fifty.

17:47.883 --> 17:50.049
-Do you want it
lighter or darker?
-(stammers): I...

17:50.132 --> 17:52.633
I would say
on the lighter side.

17:52.716 --> 17:54.965
-Ah.
-Will: Mm-hmm. See?

17:55.049 --> 17:58.007
-So you have a preference.
-But I had a gun to my head.

17:58.090 --> 17:59.132
You didn't have
a gun to your head.

17:59.215 --> 18:00.424
We're sitting
in a nice living room.

18:00.507 --> 18:01.758
We're getting ginger ales.

18:01.841 --> 18:03.549
Will:
I'm proud to be black.
I think you'd be

18:03.633 --> 18:05.215
-proud to be black, too.
-Oh, of course--

18:05.299 --> 18:06.507
Okay, I'm sorry.

18:06.591 --> 18:08.341
-I don't feel--
-I'm not wrong.

18:08.424 --> 18:10.215
-I don't feel good. Okay.
-Okay. I'm--

18:10.299 --> 18:11.716
-I'm so sorry.
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.883
-Thank you. Nice to meet you.
-Yeah. Thank you so much.

18:13.965 --> 18:16.257
-Okay, thanks for coming.
-Will: Thank you very much
for your hospitality.

18:16.341 --> 18:17.924
-Sorry about all this.
-Aw.

18:18.007 --> 18:21.299
-Thanks for having us.
-Larry: I'll get that
watch fixed.

18:22.633 --> 18:24.841
What the fuck is
the matter with you?

18:24.924 --> 18:26.674
What?

18:26.758 --> 18:28.841
Larry:
Let me ask you something.

18:28.924 --> 18:32.257
What is so hard
about being a matador?
I don't get it.

18:32.341 --> 18:34.090
-They have the cape, right?
-Right.

18:34.174 --> 18:35.924
The bull seems to run
into the cape.

18:36.007 --> 18:37.424
They don't run into the guy.

18:37.507 --> 18:39.549
-How hard is it
to go like that?
-Right.

18:39.633 --> 18:40.924
-Ow. Aah.
-Oh.

18:41.007 --> 18:42.132
-It's right there.
-Yeah.

18:42.215 --> 18:43.215
Here's the deal.

18:43.299 --> 18:45.758
You do have a tear
in the meniscus.

18:45.841 --> 18:47.466
But it's the outer edge
of the meniscus,

18:47.549 --> 18:49.799
and that area will heal itself.

18:49.883 --> 18:52.090
I think some rest,
some ice,

18:52.174 --> 18:55.799
some ibuprofen. Uh,
I'd put you on a PT course.

18:55.883 --> 18:57.090
Physical therapy.
You can come here,

18:57.174 --> 18:58.799
or you can, um, have 'em
come to your home.

18:58.883 --> 19:00.591
-Whatever
you'd like. Yeah.
-What?

19:00.674 --> 19:03.799
What a relief. I just was
led to believe that I--

19:03.883 --> 19:05.257
I was gonna need surgery.

19:05.341 --> 19:08.758
-Oh. Were we a
second opinion?
-Yeah.

19:09.257 --> 19:12.466
Do you mind me asking
who the, uh, other doctor is?

19:12.549 --> 19:14.257
It's Dr. Seiderman.

19:14.341 --> 19:15.633
Good doctor.

19:15.716 --> 19:16.841
Oh, you know him?

19:16.924 --> 19:19.049
We've crossed paths
a time or two.

19:19.132 --> 19:20.591
Yeah.

19:20.674 --> 19:23.965
You are gonna tell
the other doctor about me.

19:24.049 --> 19:25.299
Yeah. I already did.

19:25.382 --> 19:26.382
-Oh, you did?
-Yeah.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.799
Did you mention me by name?

19:28.883 --> 19:31.466
-No.
-Okay.

19:31.549 --> 19:33.633
(sighs)
I don't know how
I'm gonna tell him.

19:34.049 --> 19:36.591
(sighs)
It's gotta be done.

19:36.674 --> 19:39.591
(siren blaring)

19:45.382 --> 19:46.758
No patient in there?

19:46.841 --> 19:48.174
No. No patient.

19:48.257 --> 19:50.007
Just a lot of traffic.

19:50.090 --> 19:53.257
Really. So you just
put the siren on?

19:53.341 --> 19:54.674
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Really?

19:54.758 --> 19:56.174
Another siren abuser.

19:56.257 --> 19:57.674
It's not abuse. I--

19:57.758 --> 19:59.424
It's more of,
it's more use.

19:59.507 --> 20:00.716
If word gets out

20:00.799 --> 20:02.841
that all of you people
are just putting sirens on

20:02.924 --> 20:04.341
to get to places faster,

20:04.424 --> 20:06.799
nobody's gonna pull over
to the side of the road
anymore.

20:06.883 --> 20:08.591
And then you know
what's gonna happen?

20:08.674 --> 20:10.507
You're gonna have
some dead people.

20:10.591 --> 20:12.799
-Gotta get these inside, sir.
-Ugh. Of course!

20:12.883 --> 20:14.424
Enjoy your coffee.

20:16.257 --> 20:18.507
Uh... (clears throat)

20:18.591 --> 20:21.716
According to this doctor,
uh...

20:21.799 --> 20:25.674
he said I didn't need
to get the... surgery.

20:25.758 --> 20:26.883
No surgery.

20:26.965 --> 20:28.716
He said I just needed
some physical therapy,

20:28.799 --> 20:30.924
and some ibuprofen.

20:31.007 --> 20:33.965
And everything will
just magically return
to, uh, to health, huh?

20:34.049 --> 20:36.674
-Yeah.
-So, I think it's worth
giving a shot, no?

20:36.758 --> 20:37.965
-And, uh...
-Yeah?

20:38.049 --> 20:39.215
...who was the doctor?

20:39.299 --> 20:41.215
Uh, Dr. Fuller.

20:41.299 --> 20:42.633
-Mark Fuller.
-Yeah.

20:42.716 --> 20:45.007
Hmm. Nice doctor.

20:45.090 --> 20:46.341
Good energy.

20:46.424 --> 20:48.257
I know how it goes.

20:48.341 --> 20:50.174
-Well, good luck
with your, uh--
-Aw, come on.

20:50.257 --> 20:52.299
(stammers): Don't...
don't be mad. Come on.

20:52.382 --> 20:53.883
Mad? I'm not mad.
I'm just--

20:53.965 --> 20:55.883
You're...
you're a little peeved.

20:55.965 --> 20:57.674
Well, good luck
in your journey, Larry.

20:57.758 --> 20:59.633
And, uh, I wish you
and your knee all the best.

20:59.716 --> 21:02.007
I have a few patients
I need to see, so...

21:02.090 --> 21:04.007
if you don't mind.

21:05.090 --> 21:07.299
Okay, let's do the surgery.

21:07.382 --> 21:09.841
No. I'm not, I'm not
doing the surgery, Larry.

21:09.924 --> 21:12.049
-What? Come on. Come on,
we'll do the surgery.
-I'm not doing--

21:12.132 --> 21:13.591
You'll get no surgery from me.

21:13.674 --> 21:15.841
Nothing. Nada.  Not a stitch.
Do you understand me?

21:15.924 --> 21:17.841
I don't want anything
to do with you or your knee.

21:17.924 --> 21:19.591
-Come on, I said
I'll get the surgery.
-No!

21:19.674 --> 21:21.090
-Let me just get the surgery.
-There's no surgery.

21:21.174 --> 21:22.841
-Don't be like that! I'm sorry!
-Like what, Larry? No.

21:22.924 --> 21:25.424
-Sorry's not good enough.
-Why are you acting like
such a baby?

21:25.507 --> 21:27.674
I'm the baby?
You're the one going around town
getting a bunch of opinions!

21:27.758 --> 21:29.716
Okay, you know what?
I don't need any more
opinions, okay?

21:29.799 --> 21:32.924
Just be on the record, though,
that I said I'd get the surgery.

21:33.007 --> 21:34.591
-It's on the record, Larry.
Thank you.
-You don't wanna give it to me.

21:34.674 --> 21:36.090
You blew it!
I don't know why I ever

21:36.174 --> 21:37.215
went with you
in the first place.

21:37.299 --> 21:39.424
You sicken me!
I'm leaving.

21:39.507 --> 21:41.132
Okay?
And you'll regret it!

21:41.215 --> 21:44.341
Dominic will validate
your parking at the front desk!

21:44.424 --> 21:49.341
♪ ♪

21:58.883 --> 22:01.591
Hi. Welcome to M.K.--

22:01.674 --> 22:02.633
Hey.

22:02.716 --> 22:04.633
-Larry.
-Mila?

22:04.716 --> 22:05.924
-Yeah.
-What are you doing?

22:06.007 --> 22:07.341
-What is this?
-This is my store.

22:07.424 --> 22:08.674
What do you mean,
your store?

22:08.758 --> 22:11.466
I opened up this store
because of you.

22:11.549 --> 22:12.591
Get this, Larry.

22:12.674 --> 22:15.507
K.L. Jewelers fucked me over.

22:15.591 --> 22:17.174
I went in, I bought a watch.

22:17.257 --> 22:19.382
I started wearing it,
I started noticing I was
late everywhere I went.

22:19.466 --> 22:21.466
I would go to like,
a meeting, and I was,
like, five minutes late.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.924
So I walked in,
I asked for a refund...

22:24.007 --> 22:25.466
They said no.

22:25.549 --> 22:26.799
Bastards.

22:26.883 --> 22:28.674
So I said,
"Fuck you, K.L. Jewelers,"

22:28.758 --> 22:31.257
and I opened up
M.K. Jewelers.

22:31.841 --> 22:33.174
Spite store, Larry.

22:33.257 --> 22:34.841
Because of you.

22:34.924 --> 22:36.174
I can't tell you how--

22:36.257 --> 22:38.382
-how pleased I am to hear this.
-Well, thank you.

22:38.466 --> 22:39.841
-Anyways, Larry!
-Yeah.

22:39.924 --> 22:41.215
-All right. Yeah.
-You came in here.
What's up?

22:41.299 --> 22:43.257
-Well, I got this watch--
-Yeah.

22:43.341 --> 22:44.633
I was gonna bring
it over there.

22:44.716 --> 22:46.215
-Gone now.
-Gone now, huh?

22:46.299 --> 22:48.549
-What are you gonna do?
-Here you go.

22:48.965 --> 22:50.382
Well, what do you
want me to do?

22:50.466 --> 22:51.466
Fix it.

22:51.549 --> 22:53.132
Well, I don't--
I don't do that, Larry.

22:53.215 --> 22:54.841
You can't fix the watch?

22:54.924 --> 22:57.382
No. Sorry.
I'm just here for spite.

22:57.466 --> 22:59.883
-Mm.
-Yeah.

22:59.965 --> 23:01.758
Jeff:
Will and Tara?

23:01.841 --> 23:04.215
Still not talking.
Still not talking.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.341
-All because of me?
-All because of you.

23:06.424 --> 23:08.049
-Who cares what shade?
-Yeah.

23:08.132 --> 23:10.466
What do you think, like,
ten years down the road
he's gonna go,

23:10.549 --> 23:12.549
"You know, he was never
as dark as I wanted."

23:12.633 --> 23:14.382
-(laughing)
-(chuckles)

23:14.466 --> 23:16.424
-You know that's
never happening.
-Yeah.

23:16.507 --> 23:18.466
Hey, you know what?
I still have his watch.

23:18.549 --> 23:20.215
-You're kidding me.
-No.

23:20.299 --> 23:22.132
I couldn't get it fixed. Look.

23:22.215 --> 23:24.299
So now you gotta carry
that thing with you
everywhere you go?

23:24.382 --> 23:26.382
-I gotta find a jeweler.
-Oh, jeez.

23:26.466 --> 23:28.049
Hey, hey, fellas.

23:28.132 --> 23:29.257
Oh, my God.

23:29.341 --> 23:31.299
Frank:
You watch, uh,
Channel 5 news?

23:31.382 --> 23:33.924
Well, there's a real smokeshow
who does the weather on there,

23:34.007 --> 23:35.507
and, uh,
we had a date last night.

23:35.591 --> 23:39.049
Mm. Where'd you go,
to the asylum where
she's staying?

23:39.132 --> 23:41.174
Go fuck yourself, Larry.

23:41.965 --> 23:45.174
I've never felt such antipathy
towards a bald man in my life.

23:45.257 --> 23:48.591
-He's a shanda  for the bald.
-He's a shanda  for the bald.

23:48.674 --> 23:51.549
(water running)

23:51.633 --> 23:53.466
I'll be right back.

23:53.716 --> 23:55.049
Larry:
Aha!

23:55.132 --> 23:56.924
(chuckles)
There's the water police.

23:57.007 --> 23:58.299
-Aha!
-Right on cue.

23:58.382 --> 24:00.883
Larry: Look at this.
