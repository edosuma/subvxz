That's what I'm trying to--
[exhales]

someone did this to you?

Here.

He cut me here,

16:08.910 --> 16:11.410
and then he put
his bloody wrist

up against my arm and said,
"My blood is your blood now."

16:15.830 --> 16:17.590
And then whatever
was inside of him

came out of him
and went into me.

this to me, all right?

they had been feeding
on him for years.

16:52.170 --> 16:54.450
And he passed it on to me,

16:54.650 --> 16:56.050
because they
wouldn't let him die.

all he wanted to do was die.

with my dad back home.

18:30.890 --> 18:32.720
There would be moments
where he'd just seem like

18:32.920 --> 18:34.550

he would never say.

to start worrying

18:54.640 --> 18:56.220
about things
like that, okay?

gonna last like this?

19:21.760 --> 19:24.120
We do things right,
it should keep to a year.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.000

what we've got now
