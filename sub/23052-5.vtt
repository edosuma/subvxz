MOTHER, AGE 52, STABBED TO DEATH
POLICE SEEK MISSING SON

00:36.661 --> 00:39.039
UNKNOWN CALLER

00:48.339 --> 00:49.257
Hello?

00:54.012 --> 00:55.013
Silent again?

00:57.974 --> 00:58.850
Who is this?

01:01.186 --> 01:02.687
Did you call me yesterday?

01:05.899 --> 01:06.733
What?

01:28.671 --> 01:31.591
Thank God! It really was you, Satoru.

01:34.177 --> 01:39.015
I see the resemblance to your mother.
Do you remember me? I'm Sawada.

01:39.098 --> 01:42.310
I worked with your mother
in TV Ishikari's News Division.

01:42.393 --> 01:43.978
I'm a freelance writer now.

01:45.855 --> 01:48.399
Don't worry. I haven't called the police.

01:48.483 --> 01:51.236
And I'm also not the one
who killed your mother.

01:53.071 --> 01:55.698
You don't suspect me?

01:56.282 --> 02:00.328
Of course not. A woman like that
could never have raised a murderer.

02:27.021 --> 02:28.022
What happened?

02:31.776 --> 02:34.487
That girl must have vital information.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.532
-He wanted to keep her silent.
-Yes.

02:38.158 --> 02:42.370
We found her fingerprints
on the weapon used to kill the mother.

02:42.453 --> 02:45.999
After getting her to help kill his mother,
he no longer needed her.

02:46.082 --> 02:47.876
So, he was getting rid of her.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.301
No.

02:57.677 --> 02:58.928
That's not it at all.

03:26.664 --> 03:27.749
Satoru.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.502
I have to tell you something.

03:31.961 --> 03:33.630
The day Sachiko was killed,

03:34.339 --> 03:36.174
I got a call from her.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.928
She wanted to talk about

03:40.470 --> 03:44.140
the serial kidnappings and murders
that happened 18 years ago.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.142
<i>Hello, it's been a long time.</i>

03:46.559 --> 03:47.936
<i>It's Sachiko Fujinuma.</i>

03:48.728 --> 03:49.687
<i>Look.</i>

03:50.230 --> 03:52.774
<i>It's about the kidnappings</i>
<i>from 18 years ago.</i>

03:53.691 --> 03:56.402
She said she might know
who the real killer was.

03:56.486 --> 03:59.781
Then who...was the real killer? She didn't tell me because
she wasn't sure about the name.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.374
But...

04:11.501 --> 04:13.503
I feel like we finally found it.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.507
A tiny crack in the killer's
meticulously-covered tracks.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.564
You should read this.

04:34.857 --> 04:38.361
It's the report I compiled
on the crimes from 18 years ago.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.447
Thank you.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.956
MAN IN HIS 20S ARRESTED

<i>He took her to an industrial freezer</i>

SHIRATORI SUSPECTED IN CHILD MURDERS

05:50.016 --> 05:52.101
KILLINGS IN INDUSTRIAL FREEZER

05:52.602 --> 05:55.021
Yuuki would never do something like this!

06:00.234 --> 06:02.070
SHIRATORI FOODS

06:10.578 --> 06:11.537
It's my fault.

06:13.247 --> 06:16.793
If I'd only...
insisted on his innocence more...

06:16.876 --> 06:18.628
Yuuki isn't the killer!

06:18.711 --> 06:21.339
-Yuuki isn't the killer!
-The killer's been caught!

06:21.422 --> 06:25.093
-No! Yuuki isn't the killer!
-Satoru! Forget about all of this!

06:29.305 --> 06:30.223
Satoru...

06:31.516 --> 06:34.185
it's not that Sachiko didn't believe you.

06:35.686 --> 06:37.814
Make them forget about the killings?

06:38.689 --> 06:41.025
That means erasing their memories, too.

06:41.317 --> 06:42.985
I know it's wrong.

06:44.946 --> 06:48.825
But I still want the children to forget
that any of this ever happened.

06:49.951 --> 06:53.454
She just wanted to ease your burden.

06:54.956 --> 06:59.961
We just tried to make it easier...
for you kids to forget about it.

07:05.424 --> 07:09.220
SHIRATORI REARRESTED IN CONNECTION
TO HIROMI'S MURDER

07:09.846 --> 07:14.851
In any case, Jun Shiratori had no alibi,
so I don't think it would've mattered.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.615
-Hey.
-Yes?

07:29.699 --> 07:32.160
-You go grab something to eat first.
-Okay.

07:54.599 --> 07:58.144
UNKNOWN CALLER

08:02.648 --> 08:03.900
Hello?

08:04.692 --> 08:05.568
Satoru?

08:05.985 --> 08:07.778
Thank goodness, you kept it on.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.197
Airi?

08:11.616 --> 08:12.825
Are you okay?

08:13.201 --> 08:16.329
Yeah. Anyway, I want to talk about
the killer.

08:16.704 --> 08:17.705
Can we meet?

08:22.335 --> 08:26.172
Don't worry, Airi promises to come alone.

08:27.215 --> 08:30.134
Okay, we'll meet under the overpass.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.136
Thank you, I'll be right there.

09:19.308 --> 09:22.895
<i>I could've just asked her</i>
<i>about the killer over the phone.</i>

09:25.314 --> 09:26.190
<i>But...</i>

09:33.447 --> 09:35.366
Satoru, I'm here!

09:42.623 --> 09:45.793
Sorry I'm late, I had to lose
the detectives tailing me.

09:47.378 --> 09:48.212
It's okay.

09:49.714 --> 09:53.467
I'm ashamed to admit I thought
it might be a trap set by the police.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.512
<i>I said it aloud.</i>

09:56.887 --> 09:59.599
Well, you have to!
You're a fugitive, after all.

10:03.978 --> 10:04.812
So...

10:05.896 --> 10:09.191
I actually saw the killer's face.

10:10.484 --> 10:13.070
-Is it someone you know?
-No, nobody I knew.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.824
But I feel like I just met him recently.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.702
Probably at the restaurant.

10:19.785 --> 10:20.870
At the restaurant?

10:22.955 --> 10:24.540
Have I met him, too, then?

10:25.791 --> 10:26.667
Who is it?

10:29.003 --> 10:29.920
Satoru!

10:31.172 --> 10:34.508
I understand how you feel,
but don't do anything reckless.

10:35.885 --> 10:36.886
Yeah.

10:43.392 --> 10:46.270
I'm like the Grim Reaper.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.232
I'm trying to do the right thing,

10:51.525 --> 10:55.154
but the more I do, the more misery I bring
the people involved.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.448
That's not true.

10:58.616 --> 11:01.494
Everything in front of us
is still in progress.

11:02.203 --> 11:06.207
This isn't anywhere near over,
and nobody knows how it will end.

11:21.180 --> 11:24.183
Dispatch. Target has been located
under the overpass.

11:24.266 --> 11:27.353
-You are Satoru Fujinuma?
-Suspect detained at 4:50 p.m.

11:27.436 --> 11:31.357
You're under arrest for murder, attempted
murder, and breaking and entering.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.490
Satoru didn't do it.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.285
I'm sorry, Satoru!

11:45.329 --> 11:47.915
I led the police right to you.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.793
Even though I promised to come alone.

11:54.839 --> 11:55.756
I'm sorry.

11:56.882 --> 11:59.009
I'm sorry, this is all my fault!

11:59.093 --> 12:00.261
Airi, you're wrong.

12:01.595 --> 12:05.558
I can keep going because I know
you still believe in me.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.102
Satoru...

12:10.104 --> 12:11.188
Thank you, Airi.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.108
I'm glad I trusted you.

12:15.276 --> 12:16.444
I'm really glad...

12:17.153 --> 12:18.529
I met you.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.534
FEBRUARY 29TH (MONDAY)

13:46.617 --> 13:47.826
<i>I'm back...</i>

13:48.619 --> 13:51.205
<i>in the year 1988</i>

13:51.914 --> 13:52.998
<i>again...</i>

13:53.916 --> 13:54.833
Satoru.

13:55.292 --> 13:58.295
Did you read the book I lent you
about two weeks ago? Poe's <i>The Man who Switched Places?</i>

14:03.926 --> 14:07.388
Sorry, I haven't finished it yet.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.015
You got a second, Satoru?

14:14.311 --> 14:16.981
<i>I never lent you any book.</i>

14:17.773 --> 14:18.649
What?

14:20.109 --> 14:22.570
Who are you, exactly?

14:25.531 --> 14:29.785
You've been different ever since the day
I noticed you looking at Hinazuki.

14:30.411 --> 14:35.040
Maybe I only noticed because
I knew about Hinazuki's bruises, too.

14:37.459 --> 14:41.630
<i>This is not good. I got too wrapped up</i>
<i>with Hinazuki to cover myself.</i>

14:41.714 --> 14:45.759
I might be able to see the situation,
but I'm bad with taking action.

14:46.510 --> 14:49.722
But there you were
getting involved right in front of me.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.975
The old Satoru would've never done that.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.771
Tell me, who are you?

15:02.484 --> 15:03.360
I'm...

15:05.946 --> 15:07.531
I'm a defender of justice.

15:10.701 --> 15:11.577
I mean...

15:12.161 --> 15:14.121
that's what I want to be.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.878
<i>I guess I have to tell Kenya the truth.</i> Kenya... Hinazuki is going to be killed.

15:27.885 --> 15:31.472
I saw her after she'd been abused.
If it were at night,

15:31.847 --> 15:33.474
Hinazuki would've been dead.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.270
So, next time,

15:39.063 --> 15:40.314
I'm going to stop it.

15:46.362 --> 15:50.032
Satoru, you're already
a defender of justice.

16:17.518 --> 16:18.936
Hey, Mom.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.314
You're still awake?

16:23.357 --> 16:25.442
I just want you to remember.

16:30.864 --> 16:34.451
You can actually...
make it to Ueno on one train.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.914
What are you talking about?

16:39.915 --> 16:40.791
Good night.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.061
<i>This is when it matters.</i>

MARCH 2ND (THURSDAY)

17:46.148 --> 17:48.525
Happy birthday!

17:52.529 --> 17:55.324
-Here's your presents.
-We're giving presents already?

17:56.075 --> 17:58.494
-Here, here's mine. Here you go.
-Thanks!

17:58.911 --> 17:59.912
Here you go.

18:38.617 --> 18:39.493
<i>It's today.</i>

18:40.202 --> 18:43.497
<i>My actions today will change the future.</i>

18:43.956 --> 18:44.873
It's so good.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.716
I forgot something at school.
I'll be right back.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.344
-You're going this late?
-Yeah.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.388
Be careful, all right?

19:13.443 --> 19:16.363
SHIRATORI FOODS INC.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.413
What? Who did this?!

19:29.668 --> 19:30.586
DIE

19:31.170 --> 19:33.255
-Jun, call the police!
-Okay!

19:34.923 --> 19:40.304
<i>Good. Now the police will be able to give</i>
<i>Yuuki an alibi for tonight.</i>

5. PUT IN THE FLASH BUTTON

21:12.479 --> 21:14.273
<i>Hinazuki won't have to die!</i>

21:19.695 --> 21:20.988
Try to calm down.

21:28.996 --> 21:33.583
I couldn't help feeling
that Hinazuki was in danger today.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.211
Come talk to me, then.

21:36.878 --> 21:39.589
You're not alone in this anymore.

21:45.012 --> 21:45.929
That's it.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.391
Kenya, I need your help.

21:57.899 --> 21:59.484
You should take this one.

21:59.568 --> 22:02.362
Yeah, right, I'm not falling for that.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.573
Is it almost time to call it a night?

22:07.451 --> 22:08.535
Let's clean up.

22:09.036 --> 22:10.495
Okay.

22:13.665 --> 22:16.752
-Thank you for having us today.
-Thank you very much.

22:16.835 --> 22:17.794
Thank you!

22:18.337 --> 22:19.671
-Be careful, now.
-Yes.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.758
-Thank you for having me.
-Take care.

22:22.841 --> 22:25.427
-Thank you for having me.
-Thanks for coming.

22:25.677 --> 22:28.305
-All right, I'll go walk Hinazuki home.
-Okay.

22:36.480 --> 22:37.355
Hinazuki.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.902
Would you be okay
if I kidnapped you now?

22:45.864 --> 22:46.823
You stupid?

22:47.199 --> 22:50.160
Yeah. That's why this was
all I could come up with.

23:01.713 --> 23:02.672
Here we are. What is this?

23:15.435 --> 23:18.313
It used to be the club room
for Izumi's ice hockey club.

23:18.396 --> 23:20.190
It's just used for storage now.

23:21.983 --> 23:22.901
Let's go.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.279
Satoru!

23:26.863 --> 23:29.449
-Kenya!
-Help me get the stove inside.

23:29.533 --> 23:32.702
Okay. Why don't you go inside
and wait for us, Hinazuki?

23:37.749 --> 23:39.459
It's all the way in the back.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.154
It came together nicely, huh?

24:08.238 --> 24:09.906
Yeah, we did good.

24:11.783 --> 24:13.910
Well, we should get going.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.997
Bye. I'll be back tomorrow.

24:22.043 --> 24:23.295
Thank you.

24:26.506 --> 24:28.967
Satoru, Kenya. You don't have to thank us.
We're friends.

24:32.429 --> 24:34.014
Don't worry, Kayo.

24:34.097 --> 24:36.057
We promise we'll protect you.

24:42.564 --> 24:43.815
See you.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.240
Thanks, Kenya.

24:53.074 --> 24:56.620
It's too early for that.
We haven't gotten to the tricky part.

24:56.703 --> 24:57.537
Yeah.

25:00.749 --> 25:03.960
-You finally called her Kayo.
-What? No, I didn't.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.337
-You did.
-Did not.

25:05.420 --> 25:07.088
You just didn't notice.

25:07.380 --> 25:09.633
-I didn't call her that.
-You did, too!

25:11.676 --> 25:12.677
Maybe I did...

25:43.917 --> 25:45.210
-Haruko Nomura.
-Here.

25:45.293 --> 25:46.628
-Kaori Hasebe.
-Here.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.171
-Koichi Hamada.
-Here.

25:48.255 --> 25:49.464
Kayo Hinazuki.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.510
I guess Kayo is late again.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.556
Satoru Fujinuma.

25:59.140 --> 26:00.183
Here.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.395
-Kazuma Horiguchi.
-Here.

26:03.478 --> 26:04.771
-Yuko Matsumoto.
-Here.

26:04.854 --> 26:06.439
-Misato Yanagihara.
-Here.

26:06.523 --> 26:07.607
-Ami Yuuki.
-Here.

26:07.691 --> 26:08.817
Naoki Watanabe.

26:30.505 --> 26:33.800
Hello, I'm Yashiro, a teacher
at Mikoto Elementary School.

26:34.259 --> 26:38.096
Could you connect me with the person
in charge of child abuse cases?

26:44.561 --> 26:47.480
I'm sorry I roped you into this, too,
Hiromi.

26:48.565 --> 26:51.401
I'm just glad anybody would want my help.

26:51.818 --> 26:55.405
Besides, I'd just be all alone in my house
until 8:00.

26:58.074 --> 27:02.120
I'm sorry to you, too, Kayo.
For keeping you locked in here.

27:02.662 --> 27:08.543
No. I've never had so much fun.
I'm glad I got up the courage to come.

27:11.171 --> 27:13.381
So, what's going to happen in the end?

27:14.257 --> 27:15.508
Don't worry.

27:16.217 --> 27:19.137
-I'll take the responsibility for this.
-You stupid?

27:20.597 --> 27:25.226
If we just say this was my idea...
and you all just helped me...

27:27.395 --> 27:29.397
then nobody will get into trouble!

27:30.440 --> 27:31.691
That's true.

27:36.363 --> 27:39.115
We never thought of that, huh?

28:23.743 --> 28:24.828
Satoru?

28:25.305 --> 28:31.399
