00:02.454 --> 00:03.394
Previously on ...

00:03.454 --> 00:05.274
I'm almost a fully qualified
pathologist.

00:05.334 --> 00:07.994
Almost is the difference between
supervisor and trainee.

00:08.054 --> 00:10.434
The difference between dinner
and... not dinner.

00:10.494 --> 00:12.754
 The possession charge
is a slam-dunk.

00:12.814 --> 00:14.390
So, I'm going to jail
for something I didn't do?

00:14.414 --> 00:15.550
I think we all know who DID do it.

00:15.574 --> 00:16.954
But they're not our drugs, Fish.

00:17.014 --> 00:18.430
We have to do
what the cops should be doing.

00:18.454 --> 00:20.390
We've got to find out
who actually put those drugs there.

00:20.414 --> 00:21.870
 It can't have been
Francis Chester.

00:21.894 --> 00:24.994
He died... in a prison fire
six months ago.

00:25.054 --> 00:26.414
 Your supervisor did the PM.

00:26.454 --> 00:28.754
 Dr  Badcoe.

00:28.814 --> 00:30.354
He and Jack were like uncles to me.

00:30.414 --> 00:33.074
We have better things to do

00:33.134 --> 00:34.834
than chase ghosts.

00:34.894 --> 00:36.074
Who is this?

00:36.134 --> 00:37.994
I'm the one who shot you.

00:38.054 --> 00:39.794
I will take away
everything you love.

00:41.094 --> 00:44.634
Everything that makes your life
worth living.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:58.934 --> 02:00.634
 Just need a signature.

02:00.694 --> 02:03.074
 Any idea what caused it?

02:03.134 --> 02:06.874
Who knows? Bad wiring,
leaking fuel pump. Loose battery.

02:06.934 --> 02:08.714
I was thinking more like arson.

02:09.614 --> 02:14.634
Arson Squad might look at it if it
was, you know... worth something.

02:14.694 --> 02:16.354
Maybe you should talk to
your mechanic.

02:16.414 --> 02:17.914
I serviced it myself.

02:17.974 --> 02:19.394
You're a mechanic?

02:19.454 --> 02:21.714
Pathologist.

02:21.774 --> 02:24.954
Well... good luck working out
what killed your car.

03:24.014 --> 03:25.674
 I knew I'd find you here.

03:28.574 --> 03:30.274
I'm sorry.

03:31.414 --> 03:34.034
I know... what that car meant to you.

03:34.974 --> 03:36.834
Thank you.

03:36.894 --> 03:38.834
So, it's harder to ask.

03:39.854 --> 03:41.234
What?

03:41.294 --> 03:42.874
I spoke to Fern's lawyer.

03:43.934 --> 03:45.914
OK. Why?

03:45.974 --> 03:49.474
I wanted to know
what a trial will cost.

03:49.534 --> 03:51.994
We're gonna need six figures
for Fern's defence.

03:54.094 --> 03:56.354
Right!

03:56.414 --> 03:58.034
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

03:58.094 --> 03:59.474
I didn't say no.

03:59.534 --> 04:01.394
I'm happy to pay. I am.

04:01.454 --> 04:03.234
It's just...

04:03.294 --> 04:04.954
there's more stuff to look into.

04:05.014 --> 04:06.834
Like what? Callan? No.

04:06.894 --> 04:09.234
That phone call you got -
did you find out something?

04:09.294 --> 04:10.554
Not yet.

04:11.454 --> 04:13.874
You've done a lot for Fern.
You don't need to do any more.

04:14.974 --> 04:16.834
I'll sell the house if I have to.

04:16.894 --> 04:18.714
... !

04:30.454 --> 04:32.554
I don't suppose I could sit...
No, no!

04:32.614 --> 04:34.674
No, you may not.
You'll dirty my chair.

04:34.734 --> 04:36.794
I'm sending you away. Me?

04:36.854 --> 04:37.914
 of you.

04:37.974 --> 04:39.114
Why? Where?

04:39.174 --> 04:41.714
North Queensland. Work.
Not North Queensland.

04:41.774 --> 04:44.074
You don't like North Queensland?
I don't.

04:44.134 --> 04:46.514
Good. Nor do I. Don't much care.

04:46.574 --> 04:48.554
I'm sending  of you.
 Why?

04:48.614 --> 04:52.234
A Parks and Conservation officer has
been found with shark-bite wounds.

04:52.294 --> 04:54.434
Where exactly? Port Astor.

04:54.494 --> 04:56.554
That's  Badcoe's area.

04:58.134 --> 05:00.914
 Badcoe is indisposed.

05:00.974 --> 05:02.874
That's why I'm sending you two.

05:02.934 --> 05:05.474
Respectfully, I really feel
I could learn more here,

05:05.534 --> 05:07.634
processing three or four PMs a day,
than going...

05:07.694 --> 05:11.194
Have you ever done
a shark-attack victim before?

05:11.254 --> 05:12.674
No. Then I really think

05:12.734 --> 05:14.314
you're gonna learn more being there.

05:14.374 --> 05:16.834
Besides, Port Astor's lovely!

05:16.894 --> 05:19.394
It's a resort town.
It's got wonderful boutiques!

05:19.454 --> 05:22.354
There's a particularly good one
off the main drag.

05:22.414 --> 05:24.514
Encore Parfait? Encore Parf...

05:27.014 --> 05:28.554
It's very reasonable.

05:28.614 --> 05:31.194
OK. Your flight goes at 1100,

05:31.254 --> 05:33.394
so best you duck home and pack.

05:35.094 --> 05:37.154
Should I go home and pack?
No, no, no.

05:37.214 --> 05:39.274
No, you stay and you listen.

05:40.214 --> 05:42.914
I know Port Astor
is  Badcoe's town

05:42.974 --> 05:46.954
and I know  Badcoe
conducted the PM on Francis Chester.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.754
 Badcoe's a great pathologist.

05:48.814 --> 05:51.354
I don't doubt him.
I won't er him.

05:51.414 --> 05:53.874
If you think you might,

05:53.934 --> 05:55.874
I can always send Dr .

05:55.934 --> 05:57.394
I won't.

05:58.414 --> 06:00.794
And I'm sorry you lost
your father's car.

06:00.854 --> 06:03.314
I'm just glad it didn't happen
in our car park.

06:04.894 --> 06:06.554
Off you go.

06:06.614 --> 06:08.154
Have a good time.

06:23.414 --> 06:24.994
Has there been a coup?

06:25.054 --> 06:26.514
What happened to you?

06:26.574 --> 06:28.194
Well...

06:28.254 --> 06:30.754
I need to get
my car insurance policy.

06:31.734 --> 06:33.514
Did you get that out of my bin?

06:33.574 --> 06:35.114
You taught me to be curious.

06:36.654 --> 06:38.794
Chester was an anaesthetist.

06:38.854 --> 06:40.194
That's right.

06:40.254 --> 06:42.354
He'd inject his victims
with a muscle relaxant.

06:42.414 --> 06:44.234
Only his male victims.

06:44.294 --> 06:46.314
He wanted them immobile
but conscious,

06:46.374 --> 06:48.474
so they could watch
what he did to his female victims

06:48.534 --> 06:50.114
before he killed them .

06:50.174 --> 06:52.434
He worked in the hospital system
20 years.

06:52.494 --> 06:54.994
Staff statements say
he was one of the best they had.

06:55.054 --> 06:57.594
He was.
But he was also a psychopath.

06:58.534 --> 07:00.194
And very, very clever.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.034
And very, very dead.

07:03.134 --> 07:06.194
If anyone was smart enough
to fake their own death...

07:06.254 --> 07:08.514
He didn't.
 Badcoe confirmed that.

07:08.574 --> 07:11.234
Chester had an IQ of 158.

07:11.294 --> 07:12.954
And he died in a prison fire!

07:13.014 --> 07:15.394
Look, you can be smart and stupid
at the same time.

07:15.454 --> 07:18.554
Do you really believe
Brendan Skene shot you?

07:22.574 --> 07:24.754
I've known you for a long time.

07:24.814 --> 07:27.234
When you get a feeling like this,
you're not wrong.

07:27.294 --> 07:29.474
This time, I am.

07:29.534 --> 07:33.114
And now, for my sins, I have to
go back to North Queensland.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.834
Listen, just let me look into this.

07:35.894 --> 07:38.354
I can... No... thank you.

07:38.414 --> 07:40.674
I don't want you wasting your time.

07:40.734 --> 07:44.474
Now, tidy that up, put it back
in the bin and get to work.

07:58.254 --> 08:00.954
I hate being in a place
where you sweat just breathing.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.714
Tell me about it.

08:02.774 --> 08:04.714
Why don't you like North Queensland?

08:05.814 --> 08:07.434
Dr !

08:10.654 --> 08:12.474
Welcome to Port Astor.

08:17.974 --> 08:20.434
 I transferred.
Of course you did.

08:20.494 --> 08:22.274
Remember the fun we had last time.

08:22.334 --> 08:23.994
I've aged not to dwell on it.

08:24.054 --> 08:26.354
And you're a pathologist too,
Dr Molyneux?

08:26.414 --> 08:28.314
I am, yes.

08:28.374 --> 08:29.954
Awesome.

08:30.014 --> 08:32.634
So, Port Astor
not working out for you?

08:32.693 --> 08:34.354
No, it's great.

08:34.414 --> 08:37.193
Amazing beaches, amazing people.

08:37.254 --> 08:39.674
And an aquarium, I heard.
Indeed.

08:39.734 --> 08:41.313
It's the heart of the town.

08:41.374 --> 08:44.674
In fact, a big investors' function
is happening there tomorrow night

08:44.734 --> 08:46.434
for the rich and beautiful.

08:46.494 --> 08:48.234
No invite for me, I'm afraid.

08:49.654 --> 08:53.394
So, tell us about the case
we've come up for.

08:54.414 --> 08:55.874
It's a sad situation.

08:55.934 --> 08:58.834
One of our local Parks
and Conservation officers is dead.

08:58.894 --> 09:01.594
He was out on a small boat
late last night

09:01.654 --> 09:03.754
and his body was found this morning.

09:03.814 --> 09:06.074
But the sharks found him first.

09:06.134 --> 09:08.194
Does that happen often here?

09:08.254 --> 09:10.394
It was my first shark attack.

09:10.454 --> 09:12.514
You'll have to go gentle with me.

09:13.414 --> 09:16.674
I think, with Dr 's
experience, we'll  be fine.

09:29.574 --> 09:32.194
Well, well,
the tone's just dropped.

09:33.934 --> 09:36.154
Hey, careful. It's my tiller arm.

09:36.214 --> 09:38.234
How have you aged that,
then, ?

09:38.294 --> 09:40.354
Well, no bragging rights.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.834
Carrying some groceries
up a slippery gangplank.

09:42.894 --> 09:45.314
Thanks for stepping in.
My pleasure.

09:45.374 --> 09:46.874
Dr Molyneux,

09:46.934 --> 09:49.514
allow me to introduce you to
one of my bad influences,

09:49.574 --> 09:51.034
Dr  Badcoe.

09:51.094 --> 09:53.114
's niece.

09:53.174 --> 09:55.034
Delighted to meet you.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.074
Heard a lot about you, all good.

09:57.134 --> 09:58.554
The pleasure's mine.

09:58.614 --> 10:00.834
And this is  Free
from Parks and Conservation.

10:00.894 --> 10:02.994
She's just formally identified
the victim.

10:03.054 --> 10:04.314
?

10:04.374 --> 10:05.994
Alright. Follow me.

10:08.094 --> 10:11.234
Benjamin Raza. 's colleague.

10:11.294 --> 10:13.794
 He came to Port Astor
less than a year ago,

10:13.854 --> 10:15.594
straight from marine studies.

10:15.654 --> 10:17.194
How was he found?

10:17.254 --> 10:18.914
Jogger, on the beach.

10:18.974 --> 10:20.314
Here are the photos.

10:20.374 --> 10:22.634
Mr Raza was last seen
yesterday evening

10:22.694 --> 10:24.234
getting into the park's open boat,

10:24.294 --> 10:25.874
which was also found this morning.

10:25.934 --> 10:27.754
 Yeah, quite heavy seas
last night.

10:27.814 --> 10:29.834
Then why did he go out?

10:29.894 --> 10:31.634
 Well, he was
very passionate about

10:31.694 --> 10:33.874
protecting the local sea life.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.670
 We have
some quite rare species out there

10:35.694 --> 10:37.434
and it's our job to monitor
the numbers,

10:37.494 --> 10:38.954
and Ben was sure they were down.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.514
Down?

10:40.574 --> 10:41.954
Poachers.

10:42.014 --> 10:46.034
So, even off-duty, he'd go out
to be a presence on the water

10:46.094 --> 10:47.954
to deter illegal fishing.

10:48.014 --> 10:50.074
And I presume it's shark season.

10:50.134 --> 10:52.954
It's the tropics -
always shark season.

10:53.014 --> 10:54.514
Bloody shame.

10:55.454 --> 10:58.274
Well, lad, this one-armed

10:58.334 --> 11:00.554
will leave things
in your capable four.

11:00.614 --> 11:02.954
Mi casa es su casa.

11:03.014 --> 11:04.874
You'll know where everything is.

11:04.934 --> 11:07.954
It's set up just the way
Jack would have taught you.

11:08.014 --> 11:09.514
Thank you, .

11:38.254 --> 11:39.994
 Brendan Skene?

11:40.054 --> 11:41.914
The guy in the coldroom
who shot .

11:41.974 --> 11:43.074
Yes, I remember.

11:43.134 --> 11:45.394
What I don't understand
is why you're so interested.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.034
You did Skene's PM.

11:47.094 --> 11:48.714
I'm curious to know what you think.

11:48.774 --> 11:50.554
What I think is in the report.

11:50.614 --> 11:53.154
Yes, it is, along with phrases like,

11:53.214 --> 11:56.074
"Cataracts which did not necessarily
prevent the sighting of a gun"

11:56.134 --> 11:58.670
and "Significant rheumatoid arthritis
in the interphalangeal joints"

11:58.694 --> 12:01.434
"would not necessarily have prevented
the pulling of a trigger."

12:01.494 --> 12:04.554
Those things are equivocal.
Cause of death was not.

12:04.614 --> 12:07.674
Kidney failure
from acute diabetic ketoacidosis.

12:07.734 --> 12:10.554
Skene was riddled with
end-stage stomach cancer.

12:10.614 --> 12:12.514
Diabetes aside, he was a dead .

12:12.574 --> 12:14.554
Well, maybe that's why
he withheld his illness.

12:14.614 --> 12:15.994
Better a quick death in custody

12:16.054 --> 12:18.474
than a slow one over weeks
or months back in jail.

12:18.534 --> 12:20.994
Yes, but do you really think
Skene shot ?

12:23.414 --> 12:26.154
I think you should get into scrubs,
come do your job,

12:26.214 --> 12:28.154
unless you're ill.

12:31.534 --> 12:34.474
Ill? You don't look ill.
I think it's the start of the flu.

12:35.414 --> 12:38.274
You know, my heart rate's up
and, um, I'm achy.

12:39.414 --> 12:41.830
You know, I'd hate to set things off
and make  and the others sick,

12:41.854 --> 12:43.674
while  and are away,
so...

12:43.734 --> 12:46.034
OK. Take the day.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.674
I... may need two.

13:17.854 --> 13:19.074
Sorry.

13:19.134 --> 13:20.674
Sorry, my fault.

14:34.734 --> 14:36.474
Smells good.

14:36.534 --> 14:38.394
Duck risotto with truffles.

14:38.454 --> 14:40.154
Got a good nose, .

14:40.214 --> 14:42.794
The first one - potential disaster.

14:42.854 --> 14:44.874
We could all be on the news later.

14:44.934 --> 14:47.354
No, I think you're cooking very well...

14:47.414 --> 14:49.154
Your mum teach you? Nah.

14:49.214 --> 14:50.434
Girlfriend?

14:50.494 --> 14:52.110
Nah, but I like to cook
for my girlfriend.

14:52.134 --> 14:53.234
Yeah? Yeah.

14:53.294 --> 14:56.594
What's she do?
It's... it's complicated.

14:56.654 --> 14:58.154
You cook for your missus?

14:58.214 --> 14:59.994
Mate, never married.

15:00.054 --> 15:02.314
I thought about it, but...

15:02.374 --> 15:04.914
I simply prefer to have
more than one girlfriend.

15:06.494 --> 15:08.594
You a lady killer?

15:08.654 --> 15:10.874
, this is killing ME.

15:10.934 --> 15:13.594
Hoo! You reckon it's done?

15:13.654 --> 15:16.074
Nah. Nowhere near done yet.

15:20.694 --> 15:23.354
 So, with all four limbs
bitten off,

15:23.414 --> 15:25.834
do you think it was the blood loss
that killed him?

15:25.894 --> 15:28.674
All of his wounds
were potentially fatal.

15:28.734 --> 15:31.634
We can't know until we examine
the blood vessels severed.

15:31.694 --> 15:34.514
He was on a small boat in rough seas,

15:34.574 --> 15:36.114
in search of poachers.

15:36.174 --> 15:37.474
Yeah.

15:37.534 --> 15:39.274
He might have struck his head first.

15:39.334 --> 15:41.434
We'll check when we open his skull.

15:41.494 --> 15:44.714
Yes, or he could have
simply fallen overboard.

15:44.774 --> 15:46.634
And become fatigued and drowned.

15:46.694 --> 15:48.034
God...

15:48.094 --> 15:50.394
I can see why you guys
find your job so exciting.

15:50.454 --> 15:52.554
The mystery, the intrigue.

15:55.414 --> 15:57.794
But I think I'm gonna take these
to the station

15:57.854 --> 15:59.674
and get 'em packaged up.

16:03.774 --> 16:05.994
What are you smiling about? Him.

16:06.054 --> 16:08.274
What about him?
He's been hitting on you.

16:08.334 --> 16:10.394
And? Well, he's very handsome.

16:10.454 --> 16:12.794
Is he?
And you haven't responded.

16:12.854 --> 16:14.274
So?

16:14.334 --> 16:16.914
Well, so, you're not interested.
Says who?

16:18.854 --> 16:21.474
I'm not blind.

16:21.534 --> 16:24.274
He's very charming, very attractive.

16:25.254 --> 16:27.634
What I don't get is why you care.

16:27.694 --> 16:31.314
Are you trying to
set me up with ?

16:31.374 --> 16:33.154
What?! No!

16:33.214 --> 16:35.150
And given where we're at,
it's really none of your business

16:35.174 --> 16:37.154
who I find attractive or not, is it?

16:38.134 --> 16:39.594
No.

16:39.654 --> 16:41.114
Then, let's get to work.

16:49.294 --> 16:52.674
Another puncture wound
below right clavicle.

16:52.734 --> 16:55.514
What is it about the sea
that people keep dying in it?

16:55.574 --> 16:57.474
I don't know.

16:57.534 --> 16:58.954
But I get it.

16:59.934 --> 17:02.034
That the risk of dying is outweighed

17:02.094 --> 17:06.074
by some age-old need to pit oneself
against her whims.

17:07.414 --> 17:10.554
Well, poor Mr Raza pitted himself
against them and look what happened.

17:10.614 --> 17:11.674
Yes.

17:15.574 --> 17:16.794
Look at this.

17:16.854 --> 17:19.634
Jellyfish stingers.
Have you seen those before?

17:19.694 --> 17:22.354
At sea, not in the mortuary.

17:23.253 --> 17:26.194
Jellyfish tentacles
are lined with nematocysts -

17:26.253 --> 17:29.714
tiny cells that contain a coiled,
venomous barb and a trigger hair.

17:29.774 --> 17:31.314
Once the trigger hair is touched,

17:31.374 --> 17:34.954
the cell explodes and the barb
and venom go into the prey.

17:35.014 --> 17:37.954
Not a strong reaction to the venom.

17:38.014 --> 17:39.594
Maybe not a strong venom.

17:39.654 --> 17:42.034
Or he was deceased
when the jellyfish stung him,

17:42.094 --> 17:43.594
I mean, from blood loss.

17:43.654 --> 17:44.794
Or drowning.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.394
Shall we look at the lungs? Yes.

17:51.534 --> 17:53.194
What?

17:53.254 --> 17:55.954
His inside cheeks and tongue
are inflamed.

17:56.974 --> 17:59.034
Could you help me with the endoscope?

17:59.094 --> 18:00.234
Yep.

18:02.014 --> 18:05.074
My God! What happened there?

18:05.134 --> 18:07.474
It looks like he swallowed
a nest full of wasps.

18:08.414 --> 18:09.954
You may not be far wrong.

18:10.014 --> 18:11.994
Let's remove his stomach
as fast as we can.

18:28.454 --> 18:30.554
Do you think that's sea water?

18:30.614 --> 18:32.434
Yes. And acid.

18:34.574 --> 18:36.154
And...

18:42.574 --> 18:44.154
jellyfish.

18:58.454 --> 18:59.594
Ash.

18:59.654 --> 19:01.274
Sarge.

19:02.654 --> 19:04.274
Ma'am.

19:04.334 --> 19:07.354
Dr Malisano in?
She's with the boss.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.554
It's closed for the function now.

19:09.614 --> 19:11.034
That's alright. We'll be quick.

19:11.094 --> 19:12.674
Thanks, Ash.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.474
Come on. I'll introduce you
to the boss.

19:19.654 --> 19:22.234
I was so sorry
to hear about Ben Raza.

19:22.294 --> 19:24.834
We work closely
with Parks and Conservation.

19:24.894 --> 19:27.874
To learn that he was taken
by a shark, it's just...

19:27.934 --> 19:29.434
it's awful.

19:29.494 --> 19:32.954
I wouldn't have thought it would
take long to identify shark bites.

19:33.014 --> 19:36.314
It's not sharks we need
assistance with, Mr Chaudhari.

19:36.374 --> 19:40.154
You know, Sergeant, I am terribly
sympathetic and want to help.

19:40.214 --> 19:42.514
As you know, this is
a vital investors' dinner.

19:42.574 --> 19:45.714
We have guests flying in from all
over the world, and not much time.

19:45.774 --> 19:48.074
And it's not just my business
depending on its success.

19:48.134 --> 19:49.834
It's the whole town's.

19:49.894 --> 19:51.834
Don't worry. We'll make it brief.

19:51.894 --> 19:53.514
I appreciate that.

20:01.774 --> 20:03.594
Vicki?

20:03.654 --> 20:05.674
This is Dr Malisano.

20:05.734 --> 20:08.074
This is Doctors Molyneux and .

20:08.134 --> 20:10.434
They're performing the autopsy
on poor Benjamin Raza.

20:10.494 --> 20:13.594
We were wondering if you could
help us identify some jellyfish

20:13.654 --> 20:15.234
and shed light on their venom.

20:15.294 --> 20:17.354
You know, I've explained
how busy we are.

20:20.414 --> 20:23.194
It's fine. I'll take them to my lab.

20:23.254 --> 20:24.874
This way.

20:33.414 --> 20:35.274
I heard they found Ben.

20:35.334 --> 20:36.954
You knew him?

20:37.014 --> 20:39.474
Ben and I  arrived in town
around the same time.

20:39.534 --> 20:41.314
The aquarium that I work for

20:41.374 --> 20:43.430
has a licence to get fish stock
from the waters here,

20:43.454 --> 20:45.114
which Parks and Wildlife age.

20:45.174 --> 20:47.034
So... yeah.

20:47.094 --> 20:48.834
I liked him.

20:48.894 --> 20:50.594
Were you a couple?

20:50.654 --> 20:52.194
No, I'm married.

20:52.254 --> 20:54.794
And Ben, well,
he was really married to the job.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.914
He was always out in the water,

20:56.974 --> 20:59.994
which is why I was so shocked
to learn that he fell overboard.

21:00.054 --> 21:02.314
That's what we're here
to work out.

21:05.414 --> 21:07.194
Carukia barnesi,

21:07.254 --> 21:10.074
a subtype of Irukandji jellyfish.

21:10.134 --> 21:12.034
Common enough in these waters.

21:12.094 --> 21:14.594
How venomous are they? Highly.

21:14.654 --> 21:17.034
100 times more than a cobra,
apparently.

21:17.094 --> 21:18.554
What are the symptoms?

21:18.614 --> 21:21.154
Well, even a small amount of venom

21:21.214 --> 21:23.794
can produce
excruciating muscle cramps,

21:23.854 --> 21:26.194
headaches, vomiting,
trouble breathing,

21:26.254 --> 21:27.794
brain haemorrhage.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.234
How long for it to take effect?

21:29.294 --> 21:33.114
In hus, between five minutes
and two hours.

21:33.174 --> 21:36.874
But if he was stung by
more than one, maybe quicker.

21:36.934 --> 21:38.954
How y did you find?

21:39.014 --> 21:42.554
Seven - in Mr Raza's
digestive system.

21:42.614 --> 21:45.514
Ben swallowed them?
Is that possible?

21:45.574 --> 21:47.634
If he'd fallen overboard
in rough seas?

21:47.694 --> 21:50.754
Irukandji don't tend to aggregate
like that.

21:50.814 --> 21:52.594
They spread out.

21:52.654 --> 21:55.554
Unlike other jellyfish,
they actively hunt their prey.

21:56.534 --> 21:57.834
Which are?

21:58.774 --> 22:00.674
Tiny fish.

22:00.734 --> 22:02.354
Not hus.

22:06.414 --> 22:08.474
 So, what are you
sending back to Brisbane?

22:08.534 --> 22:10.394
Blood and organ samples for QIFM,

22:10.454 --> 22:12.354
as well as the sea water
and jellyfish

22:12.414 --> 22:14.034
we found in Mr Raza's stomach.

22:14.094 --> 22:15.634
Hey... Thanks.

22:15.694 --> 22:17.354
Wait, so, he swallowed
the jellyfish?

22:17.414 --> 22:18.594
Apparently.

22:18.654 --> 22:21.394
But swallowing sea water's
reasonable, given he fell overboard.

22:21.454 --> 22:22.674
Yes. Well...

22:22.734 --> 22:25.634
And there are Irukandji
in the water out there.

22:25.694 --> 22:27.194
 There are.

22:27.254 --> 22:29.994
So, Ben Raza's death
could be an accident.

22:31.174 --> 22:33.094
Well, at this stage,
we can't be sure of anything

22:33.134 --> 22:35.314
until we get the lab results.

22:35.374 --> 22:37.394
Well, this is
what happens sometimes.

22:37.454 --> 22:40.194
We need to wait for
more information before we act.

22:40.254 --> 22:42.514
Pretty nice place to wait,
though, right?

22:42.574 --> 22:44.034
It's rather warm.

22:45.054 --> 22:46.794
Excuse me. Sir?

22:46.854 --> 22:48.354
I'm Sergeant .

22:48.414 --> 22:50.094
Farhad Qadir.
You're here for the function?

22:50.134 --> 22:51.594
We are.

22:51.654 --> 22:53.790
If you wouldn't mind asking your
drivers to move their vehicles.

22:53.814 --> 22:56.434
They're illegally parked.
Of course. My apologies.

22:56.494 --> 22:58.474
That's alright. Thanks.

22:58.534 --> 23:01.594
And I apologise.
I need to get to the community hall.

23:01.654 --> 23:03.554
Drop some stuff off.

23:04.574 --> 23:06.434
Are you a crooner?

23:06.494 --> 23:08.194
No. Latin dance.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.634
You take lessons?
No, I give them.

23:10.694 --> 23:12.514
Of course you do.

23:12.574 --> 23:14.594
After that,
would you like to have dinner?

23:14.654 --> 23:16.954
Sure. That'd be nice.

23:17.014 --> 23:18.714
Can I give you a lift in?

23:18.774 --> 23:20.394
Great!

23:20.454 --> 23:22.154
You're right to get a cab?

23:22.214 --> 23:24.474
Of course you are.
You know how to do everything.

23:28.214 --> 23:31.954
Thanks for calling back. I just sent
some path samples down to you.

23:32.014 --> 23:33.554
Great. OK.

23:33.614 --> 23:35.794
Um... I'm not at work.

23:35.854 --> 23:38.274
Why not? I'm sick.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.234
You don't sound sick.

23:40.294 --> 23:43.314
Yeah, well, you don't sound
unpleasant and, yet...

23:43.374 --> 23:45.274
Well, will you be in tomorrow?

23:45.334 --> 23:46.954
I'd like them processed quickly.

23:47.014 --> 23:48.914
I'm not sure.
What is it you've got?

23:48.974 --> 23:50.154
Are you alright?

23:50.214 --> 23:52.514
I'm sure it's something
I picked up at work.

23:52.574 --> 23:54.114
Well...

23:54.174 --> 23:55.954
Alright, take it easy.

23:56.014 --> 23:57.434
OK. Bye.

24:14.134 --> 24:15.474
Hello.

24:15.534 --> 24:18.474
Ms Chanson, I'm from
the Coroner's Office.

24:18.534 --> 24:22.234
Could I ask you a couple of
questions about your ex-husband?

24:41.214 --> 24:43.274
Hi. Hi.

24:43.334 --> 24:44.754
Restaurant.

24:44.814 --> 24:47.034
These? No, I stole them.

24:47.094 --> 24:49.234
Used to think the big bucks
were in fentanyl,

24:49.294 --> 24:51.634
but the real money
is in filthy chef pants.

24:52.974 --> 24:54.874
Have you seen her?

24:54.934 --> 24:56.994
Today? No. Working. You?

24:58.014 --> 24:59.434
Well, you can't really blame her

24:59.494 --> 25:01.674
for not wanting to hang around
your place, can you?

25:01.734 --> 25:02.914
No.

25:03.814 --> 25:06.674
But she's going to jail, Callan.
She didn't steal those drugs.

25:06.734 --> 25:08.474
I know. And neither did I.

25:08.534 --> 25:10.514
But you've dealt drugs before,
haven't you?

25:12.814 --> 25:14.754
I like you, Callan.

25:14.814 --> 25:17.394
And... I'm proud to see
that you're working.

25:17.454 --> 25:19.154
But unless someone
goes to the police

25:19.214 --> 25:21.114
and tells them
who really stole those drugs,

25:21.174 --> 25:25.274
neither of us are going to get to
hug Fern for a long time, so...

25:27.614 --> 25:30.834
please... don't let her go to jail.

25:41.174 --> 25:43.954
 It was nice of you
to ask me out.

25:47.054 --> 25:49.114
Look, Gabe, I...

25:49.174 --> 25:50.634
It's OK.

25:50.694 --> 25:52.994
I know it's not really me
you want to be here with.

25:53.054 --> 25:54.514
No, it is...

25:54.574 --> 25:56.594
But not for the reason
you were thinking.

25:56.654 --> 25:58.994
You want to talk about ?

25:59.934 --> 26:01.474
Do you mind?

26:01.534 --> 26:02.834
Let's talk.

26:09.854 --> 26:11.634
 Where's your...

26:11.694 --> 26:13.954
associate pathologist?

26:14.014 --> 26:15.474
Dining elsewhere.

26:16.934 --> 26:18.834
Well, we'll have to
drink to that?

26:18.894 --> 26:20.474
Come on board.

26:25.654 --> 26:27.474
's my supervisor.

26:27.534 --> 26:29.270
I don't want anyone
thinking that I got anywhere

26:29.294 --> 26:30.794
by fluttering my eyelashes.

26:31.734 --> 26:34.714
I mean, people think
what they think, right?

26:36.374 --> 26:38.274
And if you don't go after
something good

26:38.334 --> 26:40.794
because you're afraid of
what people might think,

26:40.854 --> 26:43.234
then, sure, you're gonna have
your job

26:43.294 --> 26:46.194
and your success and your reputation.

26:46.254 --> 26:47.754
But...

26:47.814 --> 26:49.794
you're gonna have no-one
to share it with.

26:58.014 --> 27:00.034
And in our jobs...

27:00.094 --> 27:01.594
we have to talk.

27:03.134 --> 27:06.594
And sometimes the only people
who can really understand it...

27:07.694 --> 27:09.754
are the ones that see what we do.

27:16.414 --> 27:19.154
My worst was this car crash.

27:20.134 --> 27:22.394
Seven people. Four kids.

27:22.454 --> 27:24.354
One of them just turned three.

27:24.414 --> 27:25.914
He died in my arms.

27:28.614 --> 27:30.074
Yours?

27:31.014 --> 27:32.954
I'm guessing... murder?

27:34.054 --> 27:35.554
Not quite.

27:37.654 --> 27:40.714
My worst was one that didn't die.

27:47.894 --> 27:50.514
 Well, of course,
you did have Jack.

27:51.734 --> 27:53.354
So did I.

27:53.414 --> 27:55.354
We talked about the job.

27:55.414 --> 27:57.514
Yes. About the puzzles.

27:59.574 --> 28:01.994
About how someone on their knees here

28:02.054 --> 28:05.234
could be stabbed at that angle,
through the liver, there,

28:05.294 --> 28:08.114
but not the problem of
whether it all builds up.

28:08.174 --> 28:11.274
23,000 post-mortems, .

28:11.334 --> 28:13.434
You've probably done 30,000.

28:13.494 --> 28:15.514
That's a lot of ghosts.

28:18.014 --> 28:21.554
Pulling apart the dead
in a methodical way.

28:23.414 --> 28:26.394
Of course we don't know
how to cope with our jobs.

28:26.454 --> 28:29.514
And you, my friend,
you have shit luck.

28:30.934 --> 28:32.394
What do you mean?

28:33.614 --> 28:39.754
You finally find someone
who might really understand you...

28:39.814 --> 28:41.714
and, yet, here you are, with me.

28:43.094 --> 28:45.314
That's probably for the best.

28:46.854 --> 28:50.914
We jump into the furnace
because we want to see what's there.

28:52.134 --> 28:55.274
It's not fair to expect anyone
to jump in with us.

28:55.334 --> 28:56.914
True, true.

29:00.654 --> 29:02.514
Speaking of furnaces.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.754
Francis Chester.

29:04.814 --> 29:06.874
Yes.

29:07.814 --> 29:10.274
I heard you,
sent for a copy of the PM.

29:10.334 --> 29:12.394
What, you thought
I'd dropped the ball, did you?

29:12.454 --> 29:14.554
But I read the file
and I see you didn't.

29:14.614 --> 29:17.274
And, yet, you're still here, asking.

29:18.694 --> 29:21.314
Chester was a very smart .

29:21.374 --> 29:25.194
Is it possible he might have
found a way out of that prison?

29:25.254 --> 29:27.354
Look, I know how dangerous
Chester was -

29:27.414 --> 29:29.794
he was more dangerous than anything
in this bloody water.

29:29.854 --> 29:32.354
That's why I did a thorough autopsy.

29:32.414 --> 29:35.514
That particular
dangerous creature...

29:35.574 --> 29:37.234
died in captivity.

29:46.694 --> 29:48.354
In captivity.

30:15.414 --> 30:17.234
Good morning.

30:17.294 --> 30:18.794
Hi.

30:18.854 --> 30:20.434
You smell like regret.

30:21.574 --> 30:23.834
You smell like frangipani.

30:23.894 --> 30:25.314
How was dinner?

30:26.414 --> 30:28.714
Sergeant  is a...

30:28.774 --> 30:30.594
nice... friend.

30:33.174 --> 30:34.874
Couldn't sleep?

30:34.934 --> 30:36.434
Jellyfish kept me awake.

30:36.494 --> 30:38.634
Look at this.

30:42.574 --> 30:45.794
The inflammation in his oesophagus.

30:45.854 --> 30:48.354
Because he was alive
when he swallowed the Irukandji?

30:48.414 --> 30:49.954
We know that.

30:50.014 --> 30:52.194
That's what kept you awake? No.

30:52.254 --> 30:54.154
The word 'captivity' did.

30:58.174 --> 31:00.394
Queensland Institute
of Forensic Med...

31:00.454 --> 31:01.954
? ?

31:02.014 --> 31:03.914
What are you doing,
answering 's phone?

31:03.974 --> 31:06.634
I'm answering MY phone.
Why are you ringing my phone?

31:06.694 --> 31:08.514
I'm not. I'm ringing 's phone.

31:08.574 --> 31:10.394
Well, he must have
diverted his calls.

31:10.454 --> 31:13.034
Anyway, he's not here.
What do you want?

31:13.094 --> 31:14.954
Can you check my inbox please?

31:15.014 --> 31:18.154
Is there a lab report
labelled Raza there?

31:18.214 --> 31:19.434
Benjamin Raza.

31:19.494 --> 31:22.474
Let me see.

31:22.534 --> 31:24.394
Yes.

31:24.454 --> 31:26.634
Ooh! Jellyfish.

31:26.694 --> 31:28.194
You know, I once had

31:28.254 --> 31:31.714
a sublime Echizen kurage jellyfish
salad in Kudamatsu that was...

31:31.774 --> 31:33.474
Can you read
the water report, please?

31:33.534 --> 31:35.114
Yes.

31:35.174 --> 31:37.954
Stomach contents,
chemistry breakdown -

31:38.014 --> 31:41.034
hydrochloric acid, potassium
chloride, sodium chloride,

31:41.094 --> 31:42.394
sea water and...

31:44.854 --> 31:46.474
What is it?

31:46.534 --> 31:48.874
Traces of methylthioninium chloride.

31:50.254 --> 31:51.674
Thank you.

31:53.054 --> 31:54.754
Thank you.

31:54.814 --> 31:56.434
Methylene Blue!

31:56.494 --> 31:59.234
That's a dye used to treat
methemoglobinemia.

31:59.294 --> 32:00.434
Yes.

32:00.494 --> 32:03.434
It's also used as
an anti-fungal agent

32:03.494 --> 32:05.354
by people who keep tropical fish.

32:06.414 --> 32:10.194
The Irukandji that killed Benjamin
Raza didn't come from the sea.

32:10.254 --> 32:11.834
They came from a tank.

32:13.494 --> 32:15.714
You don't seriously think I did it?

32:15.774 --> 32:18.634
We got to see Raza's
phone-call history, Vicki.

32:18.694 --> 32:22.034
He made 28 calls to you
over the past month.

32:22.094 --> 32:23.874
Quite a few after 11 o'clock
at night.

32:23.934 --> 32:25.914
You weren't just workmates.

32:27.134 --> 32:29.634
Look, if my husband finds out,
he'll kill me.

32:29.694 --> 32:32.394
We found Methylene Blue
in his stomach contents,

32:32.454 --> 32:34.314
used to treat your tanks.

32:34.374 --> 32:37.074
I used to use it but I haven't
for more than a year now.

32:37.134 --> 32:39.114
I only use Simazine.

32:39.174 --> 32:42.474
You can go ahead and test my tanks.
You won't find anything.

32:43.494 --> 32:46.874
But I know for a fact
who does still use Methylene Blue.

32:48.654 --> 32:51.954
We just want a sample of the water
you keep your Irukandji in.

32:52.014 --> 32:53.674
I know what you want, Doctor.

32:53.734 --> 32:55.994
I also know you have
no authority to ask,

32:56.054 --> 32:57.634
unless you have a coronial warrant.

32:57.694 --> 32:59.434
You understand
how this makes you look?

32:59.494 --> 33:01.114
I understand perfectly
how things look.

33:01.174 --> 33:03.754
There are millions of dollars
at stake here tonight.

33:03.814 --> 33:05.834
Now, I know
how things are gonna look

33:05.894 --> 33:08.114
if there are state pathologists
in my aquarium,

33:08.174 --> 33:10.874
rolling around unfounded rumours
of murder.

33:10.934 --> 33:13.434
We'll get a warrant. Do.

33:13.494 --> 33:16.994
But until you do,
please, get away from my business

33:17.054 --> 33:19.394
before my investors begin to arrive.

33:21.294 --> 33:23.114
We'll get a warrant?

33:24.974 --> 33:28.074
So, you think Chaudhari
killed Ben Raza?

33:28.134 --> 33:30.234
What would be his motive?

33:30.294 --> 33:33.954
I don't know, but Ben Raza worked
for Parks and Conservation.

33:34.014 --> 33:36.594
He supervised
how y endangered fish

33:36.654 --> 33:38.874
the aquarium could take
for their tanks.

33:38.934 --> 33:41.834
Now, Raza thought someone local
was taking too y.

33:41.894 --> 33:44.514
It's possible Chaudhari got greedy.

33:45.774 --> 33:48.434
Are you here because you've
already gone to see Chaudhari?

33:49.454 --> 33:51.114
He wasn't keen to help.

33:52.214 --> 33:53.914
He's within his rights.

33:53.974 --> 33:55.714
We'll... we'll see
what we can do tomorrow.

33:55.774 --> 33:57.194
He'll empty the tank by then.

33:57.254 --> 33:58.594
If he does, he does.

33:58.654 --> 34:02.114
But right now, I also have to deal
with two wealthy restaurateurs

34:02.174 --> 34:03.794
with food poisoning.

34:03.854 --> 34:05.794
I'll get the ball rolling
on a warrant.

34:05.854 --> 34:07.474
But legally, that's all we can do.

34:09.813 --> 34:11.393
Sorry, Mr and Mrs Qadir.

34:11.454 --> 34:15.074
Looks like you won't be
at the function tonight.

34:15.134 --> 34:17.074
Well, we've done all we can.

34:17.134 --> 34:18.754
I guess so.

34:18.813 --> 34:20.994
And our flight's
not until the morning.

34:21.054 --> 34:22.754
We should have some fun.

34:25.134 --> 34:26.434
We should.

34:27.494 --> 34:30.114
Do you remember that boutique
Pavich mentioned?

35:06.174 --> 35:09.114
That should come with
a defibrillator.

35:11.854 --> 35:13.714
How did you age this?

35:13.774 --> 35:15.714
I have friends in high places.

35:15.774 --> 35:18.154
Well, they're not really friends
and the place they're in...

35:18.214 --> 35:20.194
Good evening. Your names?

35:20.254 --> 35:21.754
Qadir.

35:21.814 --> 35:24.394
Farhad and Roshanara Qadir.

35:30.414 --> 35:32.114
I have to say, sir,
I once had the pleasure

35:32.174 --> 35:34.254
of dining in your restaurant,
the Burooj-Az in Paris.

35:34.294 --> 35:35.714
Astonishing.

35:35.774 --> 35:37.594
Ghormeh sabzi - heaven.

35:37.654 --> 35:39.034
What do you put in it?

35:43.814 --> 35:46.034
Methylthioninium chloride.

35:50.734 --> 35:53.634
Methylene Blue -
is that what this is about?

35:53.694 --> 35:56.314
Shh. Do not shush me.

35:57.614 --> 35:59.434
Look, we're in, aren't we?

35:59.494 --> 36:01.274
We're having fun.

36:01.334 --> 36:04.034
There's lovely music, nice champagne.

36:04.094 --> 36:07.074
I just need a little water sample.

36:07.134 --> 36:09.274
Which would be totally inadmissible.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.154
But at least WE'LL know.

36:17.294 --> 36:18.834
I do love champagne

36:18.894 --> 36:21.354
and having my curiosity satisfied.

36:21.414 --> 36:23.674
OK. How do we do it?

36:23.734 --> 36:27.274
I don't know. We need to get above
the Irukandji tanks.

36:27.334 --> 36:30.154
I guess that means
we have to go out back.

36:30.214 --> 36:31.234
Shit.

36:43.254 --> 36:44.914
Well done.

37:06.894 --> 37:08.834
I'll go get us a drink

37:08.894 --> 37:11.034
and you find a way up to the tanks.

38:15.414 --> 38:17.954
 Farhad Qadir.
You're here for the function?

38:18.014 --> 38:19.674
QADIR Of course.

38:43.574 --> 38:45.514
We have some
quite rare species out there.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.434
It's our job to monitor the numbers

38:48.494 --> 38:51.314
and Ben was sure they were down.

38:52.654 --> 38:54.314
Poachers.

38:57.934 --> 38:59.434
Aagh! Aagh!

39:01.814 --> 39:03.754
What are you looking for?

39:03.814 --> 39:06.794
Raza figured out you were letting
your evil genius here

39:06.854 --> 39:09.074
overfish his aquarium licence,

39:09.134 --> 39:11.874
so you could sell
the extra poached stock

39:11.934 --> 39:13.954
to foreign collectors
like the Qadirs.

39:15.214 --> 39:17.674
I'm guessing Raza found your stash,

39:17.734 --> 39:20.794
so you forced him to drink
your Irukandjis.

39:30.414 --> 39:33.514
Are you planning
to feed me to the sharks?

39:33.574 --> 39:35.634
No. He's going to shoot you.

39:35.694 --> 39:38.234
Why should I do it? You do it.
You shoot, .

39:38.294 --> 39:40.310
I doubt he'd know which end to use.
I dumped the kid at sea.

39:40.334 --> 39:41.594
I'm not doing this too.

39:41.654 --> 39:44.194
He could hit an ocean, ,
but a small target?

39:44.254 --> 39:45.870
Do you have to wear a bib
when you feed yourself?

39:45.894 --> 39:48.114
You shut your stupid mouth! No!

40:22.694 --> 40:24.194
Dear.

40:37.614 --> 40:38.914
Aagh!

40:47.734 --> 40:49.034
Hey!

40:56.774 --> 40:59.834
You did say you wanted to have fun.

41:12.894 --> 41:15.274
 I asked you
to wait for a warrant.

41:15.334 --> 41:16.914
I know.

41:16.974 --> 41:19.354
But I just love a party.

41:25.574 --> 41:27.194
Is that my tux?

42:09.814 --> 42:12.234
Hi. Hey. It's me.

42:12.294 --> 42:13.994
How you feeling?

42:14.054 --> 42:15.754
I'm... fine. How's North Queensland?

42:15.814 --> 42:17.714
Living up to its reputation.

42:19.414 --> 42:21.314
Are you still sick?

42:21.374 --> 42:22.994
Yeah. Yeah.

42:23.054 --> 42:24.954
Just one more day should do it.

42:25.014 --> 42:26.954
, what are you really up to?

42:28.214 --> 42:29.994
I'm crossing off lists.

42:30.054 --> 42:32.834
Look, I'll tell you when I've got
something to tell you, I promise.

42:32.894 --> 42:34.354
Alright.

42:34.414 --> 42:37.514
On deck tomorrow?
Aye-aye, Captain Bligh.

42:59.094 --> 43:00.794
Lazybones.

43:05.174 --> 43:07.354
Reliqua Insurance.

43:07.414 --> 43:10.794
"We wish to advise your business's
claim against stock lost to theft"

43:10.854 --> 43:12.834
"has been successful."

43:13.894 --> 43:15.554
$30,000.

43:15.614 --> 43:19.594
He claimed 30K for that
20K of fentanyl the police seized.

43:19.654 --> 43:21.434
Nice profit.

43:22.614 --> 43:24.354
Where'd you get this?

43:24.414 --> 43:25.874
His house.

43:25.934 --> 43:28.354
Fish, babe, seriously...

43:28.414 --> 43:29.754
Look...

43:29.814 --> 43:32.594
Of course he'd claim it.
It doesn't mean anything.

43:32.654 --> 43:34.114
Yeah, maybe, yeah.

43:34.174 --> 43:36.314
Then, I found these.
What's this?

43:36.374 --> 43:37.954
A betting slip from the racecourse.

43:38.014 --> 43:39.274
$200.

43:40.414 --> 43:41.634
Is that what he won?

43:41.694 --> 43:43.754
That's what he lost.

43:43.814 --> 43:45.594
200 bucks...

43:45.654 --> 43:47.554
And there's dozens of these.

43:47.614 --> 43:49.234
What does it mean?

43:49.294 --> 43:53.194
It means we know why he had to
put in such a big insurance claim.

43:59.494 --> 44:02.514
 Raza's parents
are on their way from Sydney.

44:02.574 --> 44:05.634
And the buyers in hospital,
the Qadirs?

44:05.694 --> 44:10.234
Yeah, holding them may not be
so easy, but we'll do our best.

44:10.294 --> 44:11.914
And I'll do my best to make sure

44:11.974 --> 44:14.034
there are no more unnatural deaths
around here

44:14.094 --> 44:16.314
until  Badcoe recovers.

44:16.374 --> 44:19.154
That might be good for  of us.

44:22.654 --> 44:24.914
Speaking of ,

44:24.974 --> 44:26.754
can we make a detour?

44:38.454 --> 44:41.034
Hey, .
I'm about to jump on a plane.

44:42.094 --> 44:44.154
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

44:44.214 --> 44:46.314
It's OK. It's OK.

44:46.374 --> 44:48.594
No worries. It's alright.

44:51.174 --> 44:54.034
Jeez, I... I'm a bit under.

44:54.094 --> 44:55.754
Yeah.

44:55.814 --> 44:57.834
Come on, let's get some sleep.

44:59.574 --> 45:01.114
Jack cried.

45:02.054 --> 45:03.754
Yeah, when you were a kid.

45:03.814 --> 45:06.354
When he showed you
your daddy's body.

45:07.414 --> 45:09.154
He cried.

45:09.214 --> 45:12.234
"What's that poor boy gonna do?"
he asked.

45:12.294 --> 45:13.914
I said, "I dunno."

45:13.974 --> 45:16.274
So, I asked him, "Is he smart?"

45:16.334 --> 45:19.314
He said, "Yeah. He's smart."

45:20.774 --> 45:24.394
So, I said,
"Well, he already knows the dead."

45:25.894 --> 45:27.714
"So, let's bring him in."

45:27.774 --> 45:29.474
And you did so well.

45:31.654 --> 45:33.634
Jack was so proud.

45:33.694 --> 45:35.234
He was so proud.

45:37.134 --> 45:39.194
What can I do for you, ?

45:39.254 --> 45:41.474
"Forgive us our trespasses."

45:41.534 --> 45:43.634
"Forgive us our..."

45:43.694 --> 45:46.074
"our trespasses."

45:56.414 --> 45:58.554
All good? Yeah.

45:58.614 --> 46:00.394
Look in on him later.

46:01.414 --> 46:05.314
That'll be you one day, when you
retire and  takes over.

46:37.054 --> 46:39.354
Love? Hi.

46:39.414 --> 46:42.034
I'm looking for a  named Ross.
Ross Moran.

46:43.454 --> 46:45.114
Debt collector?

46:45.174 --> 46:46.394
Is he?

46:46.454 --> 46:48.674
No. Are you?

46:48.734 --> 46:50.154
No.

46:50.214 --> 46:52.674
We'll see, won't we?

46:52.734 --> 46:54.754
Mr Moran, I'm from
the Coroner's Office.

46:54.814 --> 46:56.234
Righto.

46:56.294 --> 46:59.194
And I'd like to ask you
a few questions

46:59.254 --> 47:01.034
about a Mr Brendan Skene.

47:02.094 --> 47:03.874
If we have to have a history lesson,

47:03.934 --> 47:05.514
let's go somewhere
a bit more private.

47:13.414 --> 47:15.554
Brendan Skene was in jail
for a long time

47:15.614 --> 47:17.634
and he sent a lot of letters home.

47:17.694 --> 47:19.674
But he didn't write them, did he?

47:19.734 --> 47:21.954
He had someone write them for him.

47:22.014 --> 47:25.034
You wrote those letters
because you shared a cell with him.

47:25.094 --> 47:26.834
Barking up a dead tree, sonny boy.

47:26.894 --> 47:28.754
But you didn't write all of them,
did you?

47:28.814 --> 47:30.554
Which means Skene had a new cellmate.

47:30.614 --> 47:33.074
So? We got moved around.

47:37.454 --> 47:39.474
Francis Chester.

47:39.534 --> 47:41.434
Was that his new cellmate?

47:48.414 --> 47:50.074
You're an idiot, kid.

47:50.134 --> 47:53.954
That's one bloke
you don't ask questions about.

47:54.014 --> 47:56.234
You tell anyone we had this chat,

47:56.294 --> 47:59.034
I'll track you down,
Mr Coroner's Office,

47:59.094 --> 48:01.114
and make you sorry.

48:11.894 --> 48:14.674
I'll, take care of this
and I'll see you in the morning.

48:19.814 --> 48:23.834
I made an error of judgement...
in my former job.

48:31.414 --> 48:32.674
OK.

48:32.734 --> 48:34.714
And, so...

48:35.894 --> 48:38.874
I thought the dead
would be easier to work with -

48:38.934 --> 48:41.314
that the responsibility
might be less.

48:41.374 --> 48:42.594
And...?

48:42.654 --> 48:44.274
And I'm not sure it is.

48:45.894 --> 48:47.634
So, you think coming to pathology,

48:47.694 --> 48:49.274
you've made another
error of judgement?

48:51.534 --> 48:53.274
I don't know.

48:55.414 --> 48:58.314
But I do know
I've met a good dancer.

49:47.414 --> 49:48.714
Hey. It's me.

49:48.774 --> 49:50.710
RECORDING You've reached
Daniel  - leave a message

49:50.734 --> 49:52.594
and I'll return your call...
at some point.

49:53.814 --> 49:55.474
Hey, it's me.

49:55.534 --> 49:57.474
I know you told me
to mind my own business

49:57.534 --> 50:00.834
but I've found something out
and it's important.

50:00.894 --> 50:03.434
So... call me back, yeah?

50:04.534 --> 50:05.834
OK.

50:35.574 --> 50:37.194
Next on ...

50:37.254 --> 50:38.994
Why would  be there?

50:39.054 --> 50:42.154
I need to know what she was doing
at that ferry stop.

50:42.214 --> 50:45.154
A link between Brendan Skene
and Francis Chester.

50:45.214 --> 50:46.914
They shared a cell together.

50:46.974 --> 50:49.154
 Sometimes, you get
so obsessed with the dead,

50:49.214 --> 50:50.594
you forget about the living.

50:50.654 --> 50:51.954
Your daughter needs you.

50:52.014 --> 50:53.874
She doesn't need you chasing ghosts.

50:54.934 --> 50:56.414
Whatever you're looking for,
you think

50:56.454 --> 50:59.354
that if you'd have done the autopsy
yourself, you'd have found it.

50:59.414 --> 51:00.630
 We can't find
a single thing

51:00.654 --> 51:02.794
to connect  with Ross Moran.
