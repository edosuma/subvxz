00:43.240 --> 00:45.280
[Balotelli]
Dear nephew,

00:45.360 --> 00:47.680
hope you haven't resorted to piracy yet.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.680
Although, after three years in Norway,

00:49.760 --> 00:52.080
I wish I had.

00:52.160 --> 00:54.000
Like the albinos of Lagos,

00:54.080 --> 00:57.400
we are isolated
from the rest of the society,

00:57.480 --> 01:00.760
and they break our spirits
by humiliating us,

01:00.840 --> 01:03.160
a process they call "integration."

01:04.840 --> 01:07.560
They say Norway is a cold country.

01:07.640 --> 01:12.520
So far, the worst cold I have felt
has not come from the climate

01:12.600 --> 01:15.480
but from the hearts of the Norwegians.

01:17.240 --> 01:18.760
But you know your uncle.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.400
- I never lose my faith in humanity.
- [engine racing]

01:22.480 --> 01:25.360
[in Norwegian]
Look out, nigger!

01:25.440 --> 01:28.120
[in English]
Foolish man. What did I do?

01:28.200 --> 01:30.920
No nothing.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.480
[in Norwegian]
What did you say?

01:39.160 --> 01:42.920
[theme song playing]

02:14.840 --> 02:17.640
[Billy Joel's
"Only the Good Die Young" playing]

02:22.400 --> 02:24.160
[Torgeir in Norwegian]
So I'm sitting in the audience,

02:24.240 --> 02:27.840
and then the business guru brings me up
in front of everyone

02:27.920 --> 02:30.680
and says, "Torgeir,
how do we solve this problem?"

02:30.760 --> 02:33.440
He wants me to peel a banana.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.640
Easy peasy, I figure, and go at it,

02:35.720 --> 02:37.880
and he's all like, "No, no, no!"

02:37.960 --> 02:39.080
Wrong.

02:39.160 --> 02:42.360
Then he plays a video showing
how a gorilla does it.

02:42.440 --> 02:43.840
And wouldn't you know,

02:43.920 --> 02:46.040
the monkey does it
the complete opposite way.

02:46.120 --> 02:48.240
Like this!

02:48.320 --> 02:49.840
[in English]
So, you know...

02:49.920 --> 02:51.480
Much easier. Much easier.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.480
So let me get this straight.

02:53.560 --> 02:57.320
I pay you to take a business seminar,

02:57.400 --> 02:59.520
and you learn how to peel a banana?

02:59.600 --> 03:02.760
Jesus, the banana
is a metaphor, you know.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.440
It-- The gorilla teaches us

03:04.520 --> 03:07.240
to see the problem with--
from a different angle.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.720
Okay, that's it.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.320
No more school for you.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.360
These big words
are causing brain damage.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.520
- [camera clicks]
- Oh, fuck.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.040
How fast was I going?

03:17.120 --> 03:18.440
Okay, fast.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.080
Great.

03:21.160 --> 03:24.920
Who am I gonna have to buy
to get out of this one?

03:25.000 --> 03:27.320
Damn it.

03:27.400 --> 03:31.520
But, boss, maybe if you start
thinking like a monkey,

03:31.600 --> 03:36.080
you will see the problem
with different perspective.

03:36.160 --> 03:38.960
[Jan in Norwegian]
The point of the discrimination-ball

03:39.040 --> 03:43.120
is that we can make fun of everything.

03:43.200 --> 03:48.160
By kidding around within
a safe confine like this,

03:48.240 --> 03:51.800
we take the sting out of the bad words.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.920
Take that, chocolate man.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.920
- [Laban] White ass.
- [laughs]

03:58.000 --> 04:01.360
Good one! Brownie.

04:01.440 --> 04:04.920
- Potato.
- You see?

04:05.000 --> 04:07.200
The bad words lose all meaning!

04:07.280 --> 04:09.760
Jungle bunny.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.080
Fucking cunt.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.600
That's not cool, Balotelli.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.400
Why not?

04:17.480 --> 04:19.400
That phrase is gender discrimination.

04:19.480 --> 04:22.320
Today's topic is racism,
so we joke only about racism.

04:22.400 --> 04:26.800
Those are the rules you need to learn
if you want to be Norwegian.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.320
- Norwegian!
- [Jan] Where are you going?

04:28.400 --> 04:30.800
Balotelli.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.760
He's responsible for the food today.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.720
Let him be.
He's in a bad mood.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.120
- The food's all ready.
- [laughs]

04:36.200 --> 04:37.960
Mussel.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.760
Asshole.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.240
[in English] You wanna speed things up,
bananas for brains?

04:49.320 --> 04:51.840
This thing is really hard.

04:51.920 --> 04:54.320
[in Norwegian] My friend told me
he just sawed it right off.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.800
[in English]
You know what?

04:59.880 --> 05:01.840
Step aside.

05:14.240 --> 05:15.400
[crash]

05:15.480 --> 05:16.960
Ah.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.880
[in Norwegian]
That'll work too.

05:30.880 --> 05:33.440
Mmm. Ah.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.480
[in Norwegian] Our new countrymen may have
some questionable traits,

05:38.560 --> 05:40.480
but they sure know their way
around a cake.

05:40.560 --> 05:42.520
[in English]
Ah, you like this new job, huh?

05:42.600 --> 05:45.720
Yeah, I really love
driving colored people around.

05:45.800 --> 05:49.000
There's worse jobs I could think of.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.200
Check it out.

05:51.280 --> 05:54.520
[in Norwegian] Johnny capped
the photo radar over at Nordseterbakken.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.840
Is that gonna look classy
in our living room or what?

05:58.040 --> 05:59.880
[chuckles]

05:59.960 --> 06:02.320
[in Norwegian] You know the radars
are digital now?

06:02.400 --> 06:05.320
[in English]
It's digital photo.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.440
[scoffs]

06:07.520 --> 06:10.320
[in Norwegian] I bet the people
down at the Public Roads Administration

06:10.400 --> 06:14.560
will enjoy themselves when they see
the pictures of you two guys.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.720
[laughing]

06:16.800 --> 06:18.040
[clinking]

06:18.120 --> 06:20.440
[in English]
Welcome, everyone.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.240
[in Norwegian]
I'm very happy

06:24.320 --> 06:26.400
that the management
of the Flamingo group

06:26.480 --> 06:28.720
have joined us today.
We appreciate it.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.000
Now that we've acquired
a majority share,

06:31.080 --> 06:35.200
it seems appropriate
to celebrate with a fine dinner.

06:35.960 --> 06:39.840
So our excellent African chef

06:39.920 --> 06:42.320
has dished up some real treats.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.480
Just enjoy.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.480
[in English] A chef from a continent
with no food.

06:46.560 --> 06:47.920
Sounds promising.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.600
[in Norwegian]
Yummy, yummy.

06:58.640 --> 07:01.360
[in English]
San Antonio. This is real food.

07:01.440 --> 07:05.080
[in Norwegian]
Sure thing. Balotelli was a boat refugee.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.480
[in English]
Seven years in transit on Sicily.

07:07.560 --> 07:11.400
[in Norwegian] So I guess
he's picked up a thing or two.

07:11.480 --> 07:13.560
[in English]
It's like I'm back at Martorano's.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.480
- I'm so glad you like it.
- [Johnny] Like?

07:15.560 --> 07:18.320
You like happy endings
at massage parlors.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.800
This is Sophia Loren swimming naked

07:21.880 --> 07:23.800
in the Fontana di Trevi filled
with Prosecco.

07:23.880 --> 07:26.680
This is love.
I gotta meet this chef.

07:26.760 --> 07:28.280
Bring him out for a bow.

07:28.360 --> 07:31.800
[Balotelli in Norwegian]
Help! Help!

07:31.880 --> 07:33.720
[Jan]
Balotelli.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.920
[in English]
That's him?

07:39.600 --> 07:42.240
- Come on.
- [in Norwegian] Keep calm now.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.880
[Balotelli yells]

07:46.680 --> 07:48.080
[grunting]

07:48.160 --> 07:49.880
[in Norwegian]
What the fuck!

07:49.960 --> 07:51.120
[Johnny in English]
Hey!

07:54.640 --> 07:56.760
[Torgeir]
Yeah!

07:56.840 --> 08:00.640
That's what you get
for fucking with our niggers.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.640
No more Tarantino movies for you.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.800
[cheering]

08:07.880 --> 08:09.800
[Torgeir]
You racist scum!

08:13.840 --> 08:18.160
Personally, I do not believe in violence.
But... thank you.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.520
My boy's got quite a left hook,
doesn't he?

08:19.600 --> 08:22.920
[Johnny chucking] Yeah.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.960
Panna cotta to my heroes.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.560
Isn't that nice?

08:28.440 --> 08:30.000
That is nice.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.680
Oh!

08:33.760 --> 08:36.480
Like my Nana Lento used to make.

08:36.560 --> 08:37.840
That seals the deal.

08:37.920 --> 08:40.600
You are cooking for me at the club.

08:40.680 --> 08:42.560
[Balotelli]
Um, uh...

08:42.640 --> 08:44.440
- But...
- [Johnny] But what?

08:44.520 --> 08:47.800
[in Norwegian]
He has just had his application declined.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.880
- [in English] What?
- Yes.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.880
They are sending him home,
you know.

08:53.960 --> 08:55.800
What?

08:55.880 --> 08:59.240
Forget about it. This guy stays.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.760
[in Norwegian]
Well, we don't have the authority

09:01.840 --> 09:03.800
to undo a legally ratified decision

09:03.880 --> 09:06.040
by the Directorate of Immigration.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.720
[in English]
Send back some other gagoots.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.080
[in Norwegian]
You cannot just--

09:11.160 --> 09:14.880
[in English] Maybe you can explain
to Johnny how things work around here.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.240
- Well...
- [Johnny] Yeah, yeah.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.600
Why don't you explain to Johnny

09:18.680 --> 09:21.040
how things are done around here?

09:24.600 --> 09:30.120
Maybe it couldn't hurt
if we talking to the... [speaks Norwegian]

09:30.200 --> 09:32.000
[Johnny]
Ah.

09:32.080 --> 09:33.760
[in English]
Good idea.

09:43.640 --> 09:45.560
[Bjørn in Norwegian]
In constant pain.

09:45.640 --> 09:47.840
We've got it nice here at the office.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.360
We feel safe.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.040
Suddenly comes black man.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.880
He cuts off the head!
He kills!

09:53.960 --> 09:58.280
He owns. He will have.
He owns everyone.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.800
You see what I mean, right?

09:59.880 --> 10:01.640
[in English]
That's our guy?

10:01.720 --> 10:03.080
[Jan]
Mm-hm.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.000
[in Norwegian]
I read about this in  Samora.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.800
[in English]
Role play, you know?

10:06.880 --> 10:08.800
[in Norwegian]
They pretend to be Ugandan prisoners,

10:08.880 --> 10:11.000
so that they understand
the refugees better.

10:11.080 --> 10:13.040
Now! You die!

10:13.120 --> 10:16.200
If you feel that you die,
you are afraid.

10:16.280 --> 10:20.040
No! Get back on your knees!
Fucking deserter!

10:20.120 --> 10:21.920
[in English]
Sure you're up for this, huh?

10:23.400 --> 10:25.000
[Jan in Norwegian]
Long time, Bjørn.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.720
- [Bjørn] Yes.
- [Jan chuckles]

10:28.560 --> 10:30.240
Nice to...

10:30.320 --> 10:31.720
- Nice to see you again.
- [Bjørn] Likewise.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.400
And the kids?
Is it five or six you've got?

10:33.480 --> 10:35.160
It is five.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.080
[laughs] Five kids.
With three different wives.

10:37.160 --> 10:41.080
Listen, we're here
about Odera Adebayo's case.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.840
Odera, yes.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.320
His case has already been rejected.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.000
[Johnny in English]
Listen, uh...

10:49.080 --> 10:52.160
I know there's already
enough foreign moochers

10:52.240 --> 10:54.280
feasting off our welfare tit,

10:54.360 --> 10:56.480
but this guy's different, I tell you.

10:56.560 --> 10:58.560
He could really contribute.

10:58.640 --> 11:02.440
[in Norwegian] My partner,
he likes to establish a playful tone.

11:05.360 --> 11:08.160
[in English]
We don't play games at the UDI.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.120
[in Norwegian]
Yes.

11:10.200 --> 11:14.360
Okay, well, then, it's time
to remove the silk gloves.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.040
[chuckles]
You know, Bjørn,

11:17.120 --> 11:21.720
there have been some rumors about you.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.720
I allowed myself a stop by your house

11:23.800 --> 11:26.120
to collect some evidence.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.120
And as far as I can see,

11:28.200 --> 11:34.760
there's no registry of you
having a Filipino employee.

11:39.560 --> 11:42.520
Good heavens.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.760
This is crazy.

11:45.440 --> 11:49.960
You've been snooping
on my adoptive daughter?

11:51.960 --> 11:53.600
Adoptive daughter?

11:57.840 --> 11:59.760
[in English]
I'm sorry, is this the second floor?

11:59.840 --> 12:01.800
We're obviously in the wrong office.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.360
Come on, my friend.

12:06.880 --> 12:09.000
[engine starts]

12:09.080 --> 12:11.720
That went well.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.040
[in Norwegian]
Total disaster.

12:14.960 --> 12:17.080
Gonna be tricky with Balotelli now.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.880
I guess you better get used
to the Norwegian packed lunch.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.880
[in English]
I don't know about that.

12:22.960 --> 12:26.080
Maybe we've been peeling
the banana from the wrong end.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.720
[Norwegian folk music playing
over speakers]

12:46.000 --> 12:48.080
[in Norwegian]
Do you know this fella?

12:49.800 --> 12:52.480
Barely.

12:53.800 --> 12:57.560
He wanted me to sell his car for him.

12:57.640 --> 13:00.000
[Laila]
We know that.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.680
He died in a car accident up by Fåberg.

13:02.760 --> 13:06.360
What a shame.

13:07.680 --> 13:11.400
Real likable guy.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.120
How did it happen?

13:13.200 --> 13:15.800
Our main theory
is that the car lost traction

13:15.880 --> 13:19.040
and slid downhill.

13:19.120 --> 13:22.520
Yeah, you know how it is
with foreigners on winter roads.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.200
That's usually how the story goes.

13:24.280 --> 13:26.280
Exactly.

13:26.360 --> 13:30.000
But our forensic guy over here

13:30.080 --> 13:32.560
has made some discoveries
that don't quite match up.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.160
Oh?

13:34.240 --> 13:35.440
Laila.

13:35.520 --> 13:37.440
Scotland Yard is here.

13:39.320 --> 13:41.440
You take over here, David.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.040
[sighs] Yeah.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.360
See, the thing is
that the victim was found

13:50.440 --> 13:53.280
with a knitting pin lodged in his neck.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.200
Yeah, that's something.

13:59.600 --> 14:03.120
- Are you nervous?
- No. I'm totally calm.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.600
[clears throat]

14:08.680 --> 14:11.600
[in English]
It's such an honor to have you here, sir.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.200
How can we help you?

14:13.280 --> 14:15.200
- Inspector Østli?
- Yes.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.600
- You speak very good English.
- Thank you.

14:17.680 --> 14:22.400
Yes. Detective Smith, Scotland Yard.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.080
We spoke on the telephone
regarding the Hammer case.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.120
Yes. Here's the file.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.880
Uh, actually, we're not quite
finished with the case yet.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.360
Well, it was obviously an accident.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.160
Wouldn't you say?

14:34.240 --> 14:35.760
Of course. Please take this.

14:35.840 --> 14:38.520
We'll just make a new one
for ourselves.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.800
Perhaps we could meet afterwards
and discuss details?

14:41.880 --> 14:44.080
I could buy you dinner, tea,
whatever you like.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.920
Thank you.
It sounds delightful.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.920
But it looks as though
I'm going to be kept busy

14:48.000 --> 14:50.840
with paperwork all over the weekend.

14:50.920 --> 14:54.200
Before I go,
could I possibly use your toilet?

14:54.280 --> 14:55.760
Of course.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.680
Our facilities are always
at the Yard's disposal.

14:57.760 --> 14:58.840
[in Norwegian]
Thanks.

15:01.360 --> 15:04.000
Yes, Laila. There you see
how the pros operate.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.760
[sighs]

15:25.680 --> 15:27.680
[Terence in English]
According to the coppers,

15:27.760 --> 15:31.960
your brother accidentally
stabbed himself to death

15:32.040 --> 15:34.360
with a knitting needle whilst driving.

15:34.440 --> 15:36.600
Yeah. Catching up with his knitting

15:36.680 --> 15:41.240
whilst doing 150 miles an hour
in his Ferrari

15:41.320 --> 15:43.760
on these icy Norwegian roads.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.440
I don't think so.

15:45.520 --> 15:49.080
That's definitely the guy
that was handling Duncy's car.

15:51.160 --> 15:54.720
Hey, lady, you can't smoke in here.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.960
Yes, I can, darling.

Hey, hey, hey.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.200
Hey, hey.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.840
Hey, hey!

17:02.120 --> 17:05.680
[in English] We have concluded there are
no humanitarian reasons

17:05.760 --> 17:08.280
for us to let you stay in this country.

17:08.360 --> 17:09.920
Hey, you can't do this.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.440
Come on. No, no.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.000
Oh, no, no, no!

17:14.080 --> 17:15.880
Hey, hey, hey!

17:35.760 --> 17:38.040
[soft music playing over speakers]

17:39.680 --> 17:43.240
[in Norwegian]
They're off to Neverland.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.360
- Already?
- Yes.

17:45.440 --> 17:49.360
I just hold them close like this.

17:49.440 --> 17:53.600
The rhythm of my heart
lulls them to sleep.

17:53.680 --> 17:57.320
Not often you meet a guy
who has such a way around kids.

17:59.800 --> 18:03.720
It is not the only thing
I am good around.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.520
[panting]

18:24.760 --> 18:26.520
Ah, ah! Oh!

18:29.520 --> 18:31.200
Did you drink milk from me?

18:31.280 --> 18:33.480
Hm?

18:39.200 --> 18:42.840
It just really felt like you...

18:42.920 --> 18:45.680
...sucked.

18:45.760 --> 18:49.920
I probably just touched
a gland or something.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.520
Yes, yes, but it really felt like

18:52.600 --> 18:54.440
it was intentional.

18:54.520 --> 18:57.960
No, no. I did not do that.

19:05.720 --> 19:08.280
Mm.

19:08.360 --> 19:11.320

[man on phone in English]
Technical support, this is Gareth

19:20.240 --> 19:22.480
from London speaking.
What is your problem, sir?

19:22.560 --> 19:24.560
Uh, my problem is computers.

19:24.640 --> 19:28.680
That's why I'm kind of calling.
You see?

19:28.760 --> 19:31.080
We run two businesses here,
and we have 10 machines,

19:31.160 --> 19:32.960
and none of them fucking work.

19:33.040 --> 19:36.200
Right. Uh, maybe you could read me
the serial number on one of them.

19:36.280 --> 19:37.520
Hold on.

19:39.240 --> 19:45.960
It's Y374200725.

19:46.040 --> 19:49.160
These computers are not licensed, sir.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.400
I'm going to have to report you
to the police.

19:51.480 --> 19:52.800
[clears throat] Excuse me.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.800
I'm the guy running this joint.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.480
We seem to have some kind
of misunderstanding here.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.320
No misunderstanding, sir,

19:59.400 --> 20:03.040
just discovery of illegally
acquired hardware.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.040
Listen, "Gareth."

20:05.120 --> 20:07.640
You're about as English as I am.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.240
You're actually some Punjabi

20:09.320 --> 20:11.760

in some call center in Mumbai.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.600
Am I right or am I right?

20:13.680 --> 20:16.200
Actually, I'm in New Delhi, sir.

20:16.280 --> 20:17.800
[Johnny]
Is that right?

20:17.880 --> 20:20.200
How about I buy you a cow or two

20:20.280 --> 20:21.880
or some shit like that,

20:21.960 --> 20:24.000

20:27.040 --> 20:28.560
Just a minute, my friend.

[easy-listening music playing]

20:37.520 --> 20:39.040
There we are.

20:39.120 --> 20:41.680
I had to switch to a secure line.

20:41.760 --> 20:43.160
[Johnny]
Oh, good thinking.

20:43.240 --> 20:44.880
Any consideration of my offer?

20:46.320 --> 20:48.160
Here's my counteroffer.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.280
You deposit 50,000 US dollars

20:50.360 --> 20:52.040
on an account in the Cayman Islands.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.280
Fifty G's, huh?

20:53.360 --> 20:55.080
Well, that's not gonna happen.

20:55.160 --> 20:57.360
Good. I'll notify the police.

20:57.440 --> 20:59.360
Hey, take it easy, all right?

20:59.440 --> 21:02.400
Don't get your samosas all in an uproar.

21:02.480 --> 21:05.640
Uh, you ever heard of Norway?

21:05.720 --> 21:09.200
Of course.
The land of a-ha.

21:09.280 --> 21:11.200
My favorite call-waiting music.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.080
So sad and melancholic

21:13.160 --> 21:15.240
but yet so catchy.

21:15.320 --> 21:17.240
Yeah, whatever.

21:17.320 --> 21:20.400
I run an immigration center here.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.800
I can have my boys
draw up some fake papers

21:23.880 --> 21:25.240
and bring you over right away.

21:25.320 --> 21:26.520
I'm listening.

The women here are beautiful,

Huh?

This?

21:58.200 --> 22:00.280
I bought it at CC Mat.

You think I was born yesterday, Sambo?

22:02.920 --> 22:04.720
This is bullshit.

Hey, hey. What's going on here?

22:07.400 --> 22:09.880
This guy's going all Ku Klux Klan.

- Watch your mouth, boy!
- Calm down!

- Huh?
- Hm?

22:17.440 --> 22:20.840
I know what happened at Flamingo
last weekend in the handicap toilet.

22:20.920 --> 22:24.640
You, the wardrobe girl
and the toilet brush.

22:28.320 --> 22:29.840

Oh, I haven't seen that in a while.

You wanna come watch it with me?

22:48.320 --> 22:50.240
Well...

22:50.320 --> 22:52.440
It is a classic.

I'll call you Toro instead. Toro.

- Toro, like Toro-soup?
- [laughs]

23:22.120 --> 23:24.080
No, not soup. Italian.

23:24.160 --> 23:29.640
It means "bull" in Italian,
and it fits you

23:29.720 --> 23:32.760
because you are just as tough
and fearless as a bull.

with a new identity.

You want me to do what?

Give him a call and tell him what to say
to the border authorities.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.640
That's a very serious crime.

from "Afghanistan"?

28:45.680 --> 28:47.200
What do you mean?

28:47.280 --> 28:49.800
The police have gone through
his paperwork. It checks out.

28:49.880 --> 28:53.240
Yeah, it checked out real fast
after you had a talk with them.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.880
What are you implying?

28:54.960 --> 28:58.680
That fellow is a gold digger from India.

28:58.760 --> 29:01.320
And this passport is the one
we found last week.

29:01.400 --> 29:05.080

who wanted to go to Norway.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.720
What's the problem?

29:12.800 --> 29:15.760
We're giving a poor young man
a new beginning.

29:15.840 --> 29:17.720
We have a name for that.

- Trafficking.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.760
No, Randi. Stop it.

29:21.840 --> 29:24.480
What makes you think I won't
tell anyone about this?

29:26.320 --> 29:28.920
Well, if you don't do that,

29:29.000 --> 29:33.360
I just might have to spank
that sweet little ass of yours.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.840
- Hm? Hm?
- Hm?

29:35.920 --> 29:38.520

little photo-radar situation.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.600
You know how to do that shit, huh?

30:14.680 --> 30:16.920
Don't insult me.

He's a cock. He's a c--
Or, he's a cocky--

30:25.120 --> 30:28.480
- He's pretty clever.
- Oh, look at us.

30:28.560 --> 30:32.240
[Torgeir] Gareth checked that nobody
has downloaded it from the server yet,

30:32.320 --> 30:34.840
so if we delete it now, we're home free.

30:37.440 --> 30:40.520
Wait a minute.
Got an idea.

30:40.600 --> 30:43.240
You know the pool pervert?

30:43.320 --> 30:45.600
Yeah, you mean, uh...

30:47.240 --> 30:48.920
- [in Norwegian] This one?
- [Johnny in English] Yeah.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.960
Can we make it so this guy
is driving the car?

30:53.040 --> 30:55.360
Of course.
I could do that shit in '95.

30:55.440 --> 30:58.080
[chuckles]
I'm gonna like this kid.

30:59.080 --> 31:02.160
While we're at it, how about
we put a beer can in his hand?

31:02.240 --> 31:04.560
One beer can coming up.

Yeah-- What--? What is this?

35:17.320 --> 35:19.600
[chuckles]

35:19.680 --> 35:23.480
I was so inspired
by that war-simulation program,

35:23.560 --> 35:26.240
I figured you're gonna send
my guy to Nigeria,

35:26.320 --> 35:28.520
I send you to test the waters.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.680
Are you-- Are you--
Are you mad?

35:30.760 --> 35:33.320
What do you think the police will say

35:33.400 --> 35:36.320
when I tell them
about what you have done?

35:36.400 --> 35:39.120
Well, take this into consideration.

Now, you gotta ask yourself,

35:47.520 --> 35:50.000
you really wanna continue
to fuck with that guy?

35:51.120 --> 35:53.360
Here's another scenario.

35:53.440 --> 35:55.400
You play nice,

35:55.480 --> 35:58.080
you keep
your fucking mouth shut,

35:58.160 --> 36:02.360
you keep Balotelli here,
and I'll get you home safe.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.840
Okay, okay. I play nice.

37:07.560 --> 37:11.040
Okay. Let me get this straight.

You drug me, you send me to Africa...

37:13.760 --> 37:17.720

...just because of some meatballs?

No, you're not.
That's not hamburger.

Uh, listen, bro,
I gotta ask you something.

38:42.360 --> 38:46.840
Have you ever had
an erotic dream about...

38:46.920 --> 38:51.680
About something who's not a lady?

38:53.240 --> 38:56.040
You mean like animals and shit?

No, no. Like a person, just not a broad.

Of course not.

been dreaming about?

No, I haven't had those kind of dreams.

those kinds of questions?

41:09.320 --> 41:12.160
Any resemblance to real persons,
living or dead
