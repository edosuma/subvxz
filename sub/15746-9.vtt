Announcer: WELL, HERE WE ARE

00:05.960 --> 00:07.890
AT THE WORLD DOME
WHERE THE RAZEROIDS

00:07.960 --> 00:10.390
ARE TAKING ON
THE ACME RANGERS

00:10.460 --> 00:12.260
AND THEIR STAR PLAYER
TRICK DALEY.

00:12.330 --> 00:14.330
Sypher:
TRICK, YO, TRICK.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.930
DRAKE SYPHER,
YOUR NEW BACK-UP.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.330
JUST WANTED
TO SAY IT'S AWESOME

00:17.400 --> 00:18.700
TO BE PLAYING
WITH YOU, MAN.

00:18.770 --> 00:19.840
JUST AWESOME.

00:19.900 --> 00:22.010
UM, YOU'RE WHO AGAIN?

00:22.070 --> 00:25.080
SYPHER.
HIGH FIVE, MAN.

00:30.080 --> 00:32.020

00:32.080 --> 00:33.150
Announcer: AS WE START
THE FOURTH QUARTER,

00:33.220 --> 00:34.580
THE ACME RANGERS
ARE IN THE LEAD.

00:34.650 --> 00:36.350
MR. LEGHORN IS PREPARED
TO GRABZOOKA

00:36.420 --> 00:37.890
THE LAST BALL OUT
IN THIS ULTIMATE SHOWDOWN

00:37.950 --> 00:40.420
BETWEEN MAN AND MACHINE.

00:40.490 --> 00:42.630
THE RAZEROIDS HAVE
YET TO BE DEFEATED

00:42.690 --> 00:44.090
BY ANY HUMAN COMPETITION.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.400
TRICK DALEY
AND THE ACME RANGERS

00:45.460 --> 00:47.560
HAVE THEIR WORK
CUT OUT FOR THEM.

00:47.630 --> 00:51.640
AND THE BASHING
HAS BEGUN.

00:51.700 --> 00:56.210
TRICK DALEY AND RAZER RENALDO
ARE GOIN' AT IT.

00:56.270 --> 00:58.980
NUMBER 7 DRIVES
THE BALL. IT'S A GOOD PASS.

00:59.040 --> 01:01.550
IT'S HEADED
FOR TRICK DALEY.

01:02.780 --> 01:04.580
AND HE'S GOT IT!

01:04.650 --> 01:07.720
TRICK DALEY CATCHES
A PERFECT PASS.

01:07.780 --> 01:09.690
OH, NO. NO, WAIT.

01:09.750 --> 01:11.960
HE'S--HE'S SMASHING
HIS OWN PLAYERS.

01:12.020 --> 01:13.690
HE'S COMPLETELY OUT
OF CONTROL,

01:13.760 --> 01:17.390
AND THE RAZEROIDS
INTERCEPT THE BALL.

01:18.660 --> 01:19.400
RAZER RENALDO SHOOTS.

01:19.460 --> 01:21.570
IT'S GOING, GOING...

01:21.630 --> 01:23.230
AND HE SCORES!

01:23.300 --> 01:25.340
THE GAME IS TIED.

01:25.400 --> 01:27.540
NOW FOLKS,
A TRICK DALEY FUMBLE

01:27.600 --> 01:28.840
COULD LEAD US
INTO OVERTIME.

01:28.910 --> 01:30.910
IT LOOKS LIKE
THAT'LL BE IT FOR HIM.

01:30.970 --> 01:35.010
COACH WAVERLEY IS SIGNALING
FOR A SUBSTITUTION.

01:35.080 --> 01:36.310
WELL, TRICK
CERTAINLY HASN'T BEEN

01:36.380 --> 01:37.650
ON TOP OF HIS GAME
SO FAR, HAS HE, ACE?

01:37.710 --> 01:39.080
I MEAN, HE'S BEEN
MISSING EVERY SHOT

01:39.150 --> 01:40.580
AND CRASHING
INTO OTHER PLAYERS.

01:40.650 --> 01:42.420
MAN, I LOVE THIS GUY,
BUT HE STINKS TONIGHT.

01:42.490 --> 01:43.620
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON OUT THERE, COACH.

01:43.690 --> 01:46.160
IT'S LIKE I FORGOT
HOW TO PLAY.

01:46.220 --> 01:48.160
SYPHER, YOU'RE IN.

01:48.230 --> 01:50.060
Announcer:
AND HERE COMES NUMBER 12,

01:50.130 --> 01:51.400
DRAKE SYPHER.

01:51.460 --> 01:52.630
SYPHER JOINS THE ACTION

01:52.700 --> 01:54.800
AS THE RAZEROIDS
NOW CONTROL THE BALL.

01:54.860 --> 01:56.230
TURGOD SHOOTS.

01:56.300 --> 01:58.240
INTERCEPTED BY SYPHER.

01:58.300 --> 02:00.640
AND THE RAZEROIDS
ARE IN HOT PURSUIT.

02:00.700 --> 02:02.240
IF SYPHER SCORES,
THIS COULD BE

02:02.310 --> 02:05.110
THE FIRST DEFEAT
FOR THE BIONIC MASHERS.

02:05.180 --> 02:07.280
TIME IS RUNNING OUT AS
SYPHER MANEUVERS AROUND.

02:07.340 --> 02:09.010
I'VE ONLY SEEN
RIDING LIKE THIS

02:09.080 --> 02:10.150
FROM TRICK DALEY.

02:10.210 --> 02:11.750
OH, AND HE SHOOTS,

02:11.820 --> 02:13.050
USING THE BOOMERANG
RICOCHET SHOT,

02:13.120 --> 02:14.180
AND HE SCORES!

02:14.250 --> 02:15.920
THE RANGERS
WIN THE GAME!

02:15.990 --> 02:18.560
THE RANGERS
WIN THE GAME!

02:18.620 --> 02:20.190
[CHEERING]

02:20.260 --> 02:21.660
FANTASTIC.
TREMENDOUS.

02:21.730 --> 02:23.260
YOU BETTER MOVE OVER,
TRICK DALEY,

02:23.330 --> 02:25.630
'CAUSE WE GOT OURSELVES
A NEW STAR,

02:25.700 --> 02:27.730

IT WAS SO COOL

02:39.680 --> 02:41.310
THE WAY YOU BLASTED
THOSE GOALS

02:41.380 --> 02:42.880
AND SNAGGED
THOSE INTERCEPTIONS,

02:42.950 --> 02:44.480
AND I WANNA JOIN
YOUR FAN CLUB, AND TELL ME,

02:44.550 --> 02:46.320
DO YOU GET DIZZY UP

02:46.380 --> 02:47.680
THE WAY YOU SPIN ROUND
AND ROUND AND ROUND

02:47.750 --> 02:49.520
UP THERE ON THAT BIKE
OF YOURS,

02:49.590 --> 02:50.720
BECAUSE, I MEAN, YOU ARE
COLOSSAL, FANTASTIC,

02:50.790 --> 02:51.620
TREMENDOUS, STUPENDOUS.

IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU'RE VERY GOOD.

A METEOR STRIKES THE CITY
PLANET OF ACMETROPOLIS,

03:44.470 --> 03:46.540

START SPRINTING.

04:42.970 --> 04:45.500
THIS MACHINE WILL MEASURE
YOUR STEPS PER HOUR.

THAT'S AS FAST
AS I CAN GO.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.140

04:55.680 --> 04:57.650
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT
THE MACHINE IS WORKING.

04:57.710 --> 05:01.220
THE BAD NEWS IS
THAT YOU'RE NOT.

05:01.280 --> 05:03.190
36 MILES PER HOUR?

05:03.250 --> 05:04.550
ACTUALLY, 18.

05:04.620 --> 05:06.360
I DOUBLED IT
TO BE NICE.

AT THESE, ACE.

05:11.760 --> 05:14.160
COME ON, TECH.
I'VE TRIED THIS.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.730
AH, OK. HERE GOES.

[GRUNTS]

05:24.240 --> 05:25.380
THANKS, SLAM.

05:25.440 --> 05:26.710
I WAS STARTING
TO GET A HEADACHE.

05:26.780 --> 05:29.180
I'M AFRAID THERE'S
NO DENYING IT, ACE.

05:29.250 --> 05:30.680
BOTH YOU AND REV ARE

05:30.750 --> 05:33.320
NO LONGER IN POSSESSION
OF YOUR SUPER POWERS.

05:33.380 --> 05:34.850
YEAH, BUT CHECK
THIS OUT.

05:34.920 --> 05:37.490
HA! HA HA! HA!

05:37.550 --> 05:38.890
YOU CAN TAKE AWAY
MY POWERS,

05:38.960 --> 05:41.060
BUT YOU CAN'T
TAKE AWAY MY MOVES.

05:41.120 --> 05:44.490
EXACTLY. YOU'VE STILL GOT
THE MOVES THAT YOU HAD

05:44.560 --> 05:46.060
BEFORE YOU GOT
YOUR SUPER POWERS,

05:46.130 --> 05:49.230
AND REV CAN STILL RUN
LIKE A NORMAL ROAD RUNNER.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.540
WHATEVER DID THIS
MUST NOT HAVE AFFECTED

05:51.600 --> 05:52.870
YOUR NATURAL ABILITIES.

05:52.940 --> 05:56.370
OH, UM, WELL, THAT'S--
THAT'S, UH...

05:56.440 --> 05:58.880
YEAH, WELL, WHO NEEDS
SUPER POWERS ANYWAY,

05:58.940 --> 06:00.380
RIGHT, REV?

06:00.440 --> 06:02.080
YOU KNOW THE LAST
TIME I CHECKED,

06:02.150 --> 06:04.550
SUPERHEROES
NEED SUPER POWERS.

06:04.610 --> 06:06.380
YOU GUYS WERE
THE BEST OF US,

06:06.450 --> 06:08.120
BUT UNTIL YOU'RE
BETTER, I THINK

06:08.180 --> 06:10.790
IT'S TIME
FOR A NEW LEADER.

06:12.090 --> 06:14.520
Zodavia: THAT'S
AN EXCELLENT IDEA, DOC.

06:14.590 --> 06:16.430
IT IS?
ACE,

06:16.490 --> 06:17.830
UNTIL WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT HAPPENED

06:17.890 --> 06:19.560
TO YOUR ENHANCED
ABILITIES...

06:19.630 --> 06:22.300
SEE? EVEN THE BOSS LADY
AGREES WITH ME.

06:22.370 --> 06:24.000
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
OUT IN THE FIELD

06:24.070 --> 06:25.500
AND NEITHER SHOULD REV.

06:25.570 --> 06:27.000

COOL UNDER PRESSURE,

06:29.840 --> 06:31.910
AND HAVE EXCELLENT

STEAL OUR SUPER POWERS,

TOO HARD TO FIND.

ACTING AS THE GRAND MARSHAL

IN HIS HONOR.
