WEBVTT

01:00.418 --> 01:02.687
Darnell, stop, police!

01:26.345 --> 01:27.380
Darnell, wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:27.412 --> 01:29.081
I just want to talk.

01:38.257 --> 01:39.392
Darnell, wait!

01:40.792 --> 01:42.494
No, take the stairs, stairs!

01:42.527 --> 01:44.796
Go around, block the alley.

01:46.866 --> 01:48.566
Wait, man, wait please.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.635
This is 120 pursuing
the suspect on foot

01:50.669 --> 01:51.703
in the alley
Copy that, 120.

01:52.570 --> 01:53.538
Shit.

01:53.571 --> 01:54.974
Hold on, hold on.

01:56.375 --> 01:59.644
Hey, hey, kid, look
at me, look at me.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.480
Listen to me, I'm gonna
put pressure on it.

02:02.514 --> 02:03.748
Police!
You gotta hold on.

02:03.782 --> 02:05.952
All right, call an ambulance.

02:05.985 --> 02:07.320
All right, you gotta hold on.

02:07.353 --> 02:08.321
Where's the shooter?

02:08.354 --> 02:09.654
He drove off.

02:09.688 --> 02:11.257
You gotta hold on.

02:11.290 --> 02:13.426
Stay with me, come on!

02:15.962 --> 02:16.795
Come on.

02:23.735 --> 02:25.171
Captain.

02:25.204 --> 02:26.038
Douglas.

02:29.041 --> 02:30.575
The Captain's got a reason...

02:36.648 --> 02:37.450
Did you find it?

02:37.482 --> 02:39.085
We don't even have casings.

02:39.118 --> 02:39.919
They're ghosts.

02:39.952 --> 02:41.320
Did you see the shooter?

02:41.354 --> 02:43.555
No, I think these murders
are over territory.

02:43.588 --> 02:45.557
Well, I'd like to talk to him.

02:45.590 --> 02:48.593
Did you ever think that maybe
he wasn't just hiding from us?

02:49.627 --> 02:50.997
I told you to wait.

02:51.030 --> 02:51.831
Well, I thought that
he was gonna bolt.

02:51.864 --> 02:55.201
I told you to wait.

02:55.234 --> 02:58.404
I am your captain, Steve,
I gave you an order.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.642
I'm putting you on patrol.

03:05.677 --> 03:06.578
What?

03:06.611 --> 03:08.513
I said I'm fucking
putting you on patrol

03:08.546 --> 03:10.548
until I talk to the Colonel
and I figure what the hell

03:10.582 --> 03:11.417
to do with you.

03:12.418 --> 03:13.252
Captain.

03:14.652 --> 03:15.488
Captain!

03:56.594 --> 03:57.430
Hey, buddy.

03:58.596 --> 04:01.333
I thought you were going to bed.

04:03.836 --> 04:06.172
I have another night.

04:06.205 --> 04:08.606
Can you do these
before school tomorrow?

04:08.640 --> 04:09.741
You know there's an
app for that, right?

04:09.774 --> 04:12.411
I'll show you app, show you app.

04:13.812 --> 04:14.847
You'll do 'em?

04:14.880 --> 04:16.648
I'll do 'em.

04:16.681 --> 04:17.682
Thank you.

04:19.751 --> 04:21.854
It's a big day tomorrow.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.122
Get some sleep.

05:01.659 --> 05:03.229
- Chris!
- Yeah?

05:03.262 --> 05:04.662
Do you want some shrimp?

05:04.696 --> 05:05.965
I don't know.

05:24.283 --> 05:25.817
Your parents are still up.

05:25.851 --> 05:27.853
You're such a worrier.

05:33.725 --> 05:34.792
Team Dork?

05:34.827 --> 05:35.828
Team Dork.

05:38.063 --> 05:39.231
God I can't believe
you didn't tell me

05:39.265 --> 05:40.665
your parents were still up.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.610
Grant, what the hell?

05:51.644 --> 05:53.946
You forgot to unlock the gate.

05:55.147 --> 05:57.449
We had to crawl
through the bushes.

05:57.483 --> 05:58.716
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

05:59.852 --> 06:00.920
Team Dork?

06:10.996 --> 06:14.233
Is it nice kissing like that?

06:14.266 --> 06:15.367
It's okay.

06:15.401 --> 06:17.670
Making out with Brandy
Torgenson at the pool

06:17.702 --> 06:19.605
once this summer does
not make you an expert.

06:19.638 --> 06:20.973
It was more than once.

06:22.341 --> 06:23.708
It looks messy.

06:23.741 --> 06:26.345
I think as you get better
at it there's less spit.

06:29.747 --> 06:31.083
They'll be at it for
awhile, we're good.

06:31.116 --> 06:33.018
You know when your
parents are doing it?

06:33.052 --> 06:33.886
Ew.

06:33.919 --> 06:35.187
They're dealer came by.

06:35.221 --> 06:36.522
That means date night.

06:36.555 --> 06:38.357
They get loopy and
they do it for hours

06:38.390 --> 06:41.026
but lucky for us, I
found their stash.

06:41.060 --> 06:42.628
Criminal behavior,
that's what this is.

06:42.661 --> 06:43.495
Okay, let's go.

06:47.199 --> 06:48.234
So why is this thing a big deal?

06:48.267 --> 06:49.501
It's a total lunar eclipse

06:49.535 --> 06:51.303
when the moon's super
close to the Earth.

06:51.337 --> 06:52.204
Why's it's red?

06:53.771 --> 06:56.008
The light hitting the
moon is from the sun

06:56.041 --> 06:58.611
and the sun's light
comes to our atmosphere

06:58.644 --> 06:59.712
and our atmosphere refracts it

06:59.744 --> 07:01.714
which messes with
the color spectrum

07:01.746 --> 07:05.351
so it looks red, kinda
like the sun at sunset.

07:05.384 --> 07:06.218
It's cool, right?

07:06.252 --> 07:07.152
It's weird.

07:07.186 --> 07:08.153
It's creepy.

07:08.187 --> 07:09.421
Back in the day, people
thought the blood moon

07:09.455 --> 07:10.788
meant the god's were angry.

07:10.822 --> 07:12.658
Hell yeah, if I walked
out of my castle

07:12.691 --> 07:14.660
and I saw that, it be
like the world's ending.

07:14.693 --> 07:17.029
Of course in your fantasy
you have a castle.

07:17.863 --> 07:20.765
Yeah but why did they
think it meant something?

07:20.798 --> 07:22.735
Humans aren't the
center of the universe.

07:22.767 --> 07:25.137
Well, I mean, some of us are.

07:25.170 --> 07:27.573
You really think that a
little bit though, don't you?

07:27.606 --> 07:29.675
Yeah but you're one
of billions of people

07:29.708 --> 07:32.878
on one small rock out
of billions of rocks.

07:32.911 --> 07:35.214
There's a huge universe out
there in constant motion.

07:35.247 --> 07:37.516
Sometimes things just
get in each other's way.

07:37.549 --> 07:38.917
All right, Neal deGrasse,
what did you read

07:38.951 --> 07:40.486
in your big thick nerd book?

07:40.519 --> 07:41.687
Everything's random?

07:41.720 --> 07:43.889
There's no meaning to anything?

07:43.922 --> 07:44.723
What?

07:44.757 --> 07:46.791
It wasn't a book.

07:48.327 --> 07:49.794
It was a website.

07:50.663 --> 07:52.331
And I didn't say it was random.

07:52.364 --> 07:55.401
The universe works beautifully.

07:55.434 --> 07:58.270
Maybe there's a plan, maybe
that's why we're so intelligent.

07:58.304 --> 08:00.939
Maybe we're the universe
trying to figure itself out.

08:03.609 --> 08:05.678
I don't know if
it's the weed or you

08:05.711 --> 08:07.846
but my brain just
melted a little bit.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.915
Talk like that at Cold Spring,
they're gonna kill you.

08:09.948 --> 08:12.817
Not everyone can afford 30
grand a year for Gilman.

08:12.851 --> 08:15.287
You know it's not like they
gave me a choice, right?

08:15.321 --> 08:16.855
I don't want to be
away from you guys

08:16.889 --> 08:17.890
and who's gonna watch your back

08:17.923 --> 08:19.391
with all those big ass seniors?

08:19.425 --> 08:20.592
I will.

08:20.626 --> 08:22.528
I kick way more ass
than you do, anyway.

08:22.561 --> 08:23.429
Okay.

08:23.462 --> 08:25.197
I don't need anyone
to watch my back.

08:25.230 --> 08:26.965
It's gonna be different
at this school.

08:26.999 --> 08:28.300
Really?

08:28.334 --> 08:30.169
'Cause that's what you said
at the start of sixth grade

08:30.202 --> 08:31.070
and they're still
making fun of you.

08:31.103 --> 08:32.104
I'm gonna make it different.

08:32.137 --> 08:33.772
All right, dude,
just be careful.

08:33.806 --> 08:35.974
Two kids from there
got shot last month?

08:38.243 --> 08:39.445
That school is for real.

09:10.442 --> 09:11.276
Move it.

09:19.118 --> 09:20.719
Does anyone know how
many branches there are

09:20.753 --> 09:22.388
in the US government?

09:23.288 --> 09:25.758
Come on, guys.

09:25.791 --> 09:26.759
Remind me you're?

09:26.792 --> 09:28.093
Marcus.

09:28.127 --> 09:29.428
Marcus.
Three.

09:29.461 --> 09:30.729
That's right.

09:30.763 --> 09:32.898
Can anyone name one of them?

09:32.931 --> 09:33.766
Anyone?

09:35.968 --> 09:36.836
Yes.

09:36.870 --> 09:37.903
Legislative.

09:37.936 --> 09:39.438
Legislative, great.
Little suck up.

09:39.471 --> 09:40.739
And there are two more.

09:40.773 --> 09:42.741
I'd like to hear
from someone else.

09:42.775 --> 09:43.575
Emily.

09:43.609 --> 09:45.577
Uh, the president, right?

09:45.611 --> 09:47.713
The executive
branch, we call it.

09:47.746 --> 09:49.548
And can anyone guess the third?

09:49.581 --> 09:50.682
Cassie?

09:51.650 --> 09:53.485
Uh, um.

09:54.888 --> 09:55.788
I should know this.

09:55.821 --> 09:58.457
All right, folks,
let's write this down.

09:58.490 --> 10:00.692
Executive, legislative.

10:02.094 --> 10:04.530
Uh, the supreme court.

10:04.563 --> 10:06.331
Supreme court, that's right.

10:06.365 --> 10:07.633
Three columns, folks.

10:09.201 --> 10:10.402
Marcus Jackson.

10:10.436 --> 10:11.737
Still a smart kid, huh?

10:11.770 --> 10:14.139
I used to babysit Marcus
back when you were like,

10:14.173 --> 10:16.141
what seven or eight right?

10:16.175 --> 10:17.009
Something like that.

10:17.042 --> 10:18.644
You know, I'd love
to say, oh my god,

10:18.677 --> 10:20.612
you've gotten so big but uh.

10:20.646 --> 10:21.713
Hey, beautiful.

10:21.747 --> 10:22.548
Oh my god.

10:22.581 --> 10:23.682
Bryan, Jesus.

10:23.715 --> 10:25.417
What's up?
This is Marcus.

10:25.451 --> 10:26.251
He helped me in class.

10:26.285 --> 10:27.453
Like you need any help.

10:27.486 --> 10:28.922
She's smarter than I'll ever be.

10:28.954 --> 10:30.722
Marcus, this is my boyfriend.

10:30.756 --> 10:32.191
Bryan.

10:32.224 --> 10:33.692
I know, I've seen you play.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.464
So y'all went to
Keatonsville Middle?

10:38.497 --> 10:40.466
Yeah.
We went to Arbudis.

10:40.499 --> 10:42.334
Bunch of stoners.

10:42.367 --> 10:43.302
Myself included.

10:44.503 --> 10:46.705
I'm Carl, this is Ned.

10:46.738 --> 10:48.842
He's a senior but
he chills with us.

10:49.675 --> 10:50.809
Seniors are lame.

10:50.844 --> 10:52.544
Yo, we're going to hell
house after school.

10:52.578 --> 10:53.947
You guys should come by.

10:53.979 --> 10:55.047
What's hell house?

10:55.080 --> 10:56.448
An old common in the woods.

10:56.482 --> 10:58.016
People go there to
smoke weed and stuff.

10:58.050 --> 10:58.885
It's haunted.

11:00.552 --> 11:02.688
She said you're
good with computers?

11:02.721 --> 11:04.490
He's awesome with computers.

11:04.523 --> 11:06.325
Show them the phone thing.

11:06.358 --> 11:08.660
Come on, man, what's
the phone thing?

11:08.694 --> 11:09.795
It's just a little trick.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.032
All right, they're
like 20 phones nearby

11:14.066 --> 11:15.767
with their Bluetooth turned on.

11:15.801 --> 11:16.768
You really want to
keep your phone private

11:16.802 --> 11:18.804
you need to turn that
shit in airplane mode.

11:31.717 --> 11:32.518
Wait, wait, what?

11:32.551 --> 11:34.520
Do it again, do it again.

11:38.790 --> 11:39.591
Oh snap, man.

11:41.593 --> 11:42.528
You like that?

11:42.561 --> 11:44.496
You're gonna love this.

11:53.138 --> 11:54.606
Dude, you're so freaky, man.

11:59.077 --> 11:59.879
Hey!

12:00.947 --> 12:02.581
Hey, who's messing
with my phone?

12:03.549 --> 12:04.783
Huh?

12:10.023 --> 12:12.157
Mr. Howard, did you
want to chat with me?

12:13.425 --> 12:16.194
Ms. Byprin, everything's fine.

12:18.597 --> 12:20.766
That's Clay Howard.

12:41.921 --> 12:43.488
Is Grant coming or what?

12:43.522 --> 12:45.123
I don't know, he
hasn't texted back.

12:45.157 --> 12:47.626
Shit this place is creepy.

12:47.659 --> 12:49.628
I know, right?

12:51.898 --> 12:53.032
Got you.

12:53.066 --> 12:54.433
All right, come on, guys.

12:54.466 --> 12:55.300
We're up there.

12:56.368 --> 12:57.603
Is Ned coming?

12:57.636 --> 12:59.338
Man, that joker got detention.

13:00.706 --> 13:03.042
Yo, what up, players?

13:04.109 --> 13:05.744
So we start hearing this noise.

13:05.777 --> 13:06.778
Shut up.

13:06.812 --> 13:08.915
And we think it's like
the groundskeeper guy

13:08.948 --> 13:10.482
who's always chasing people off.

13:10.515 --> 13:11.817
So we put the campfire out

13:13.019 --> 13:14.419
and then we see it.

13:16.788 --> 13:18.958
Right over there.

13:18.992 --> 13:22.895
Looked like a woman wearing
like a nun's habit or some shit.

13:22.929 --> 13:24.196
A soft glow behind.

13:24.229 --> 13:26.131
You guys want to
talk about a ghost?

13:26.164 --> 13:27.666
Talk about Darnell.

13:27.699 --> 13:30.769
People are dying
around here, for real.

13:30.802 --> 13:32.005
Do you know what
happened to him?

13:32.038 --> 13:34.406
I heard some city guys
been coming around

13:34.439 --> 13:36.475
telling the small
time county dealers

13:36.508 --> 13:39.544
to step off and if they don't.

13:42.381 --> 13:43.315
I'm cool.

13:46.251 --> 13:47.719
What's the matter, man?

13:48.553 --> 13:50.455
You don't like that bud?

13:51.456 --> 13:53.492
Now see, you gotta
try that shit.

13:53.525 --> 13:55.028
I sold them that shit.

13:55.061 --> 13:56.595
That's my best
shit, right, Carl?

13:56.628 --> 13:57.462
Yeah.

13:58.363 --> 13:59.197
New blood.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.135
What's your name?

14:02.167 --> 14:03.036
Holly.

14:03.069 --> 14:04.403
Holly.

14:04.436 --> 14:05.905
And who's your friend, Holly?

14:07.606 --> 14:10.509
I'm um, Marcus?

14:10.542 --> 14:12.111
You're not sure?

14:12.145 --> 14:15.714
Okay we got Holly,
we got Um Marcus.

14:15.747 --> 14:16.548
I'm Clay.

14:16.581 --> 14:17.749
We heard.

14:17.783 --> 14:19.317
Heard about me already.

14:19.351 --> 14:21.154
Shit, curious little
freshman, huh?

14:21.186 --> 14:22.855
Can you get your
arm off me, please?

14:22.889 --> 14:24.222
So what did you hear
about me, Holly, hmm?

14:24.256 --> 14:25.892
I heard you were an asshole.

14:28.527 --> 14:31.864
Shit, honest I like it.

14:31.898 --> 14:33.900
So since we're being honest.

14:33.933 --> 14:37.136
Why did you go through
my phone, Um Marcus?

14:39.072 --> 14:40.173
I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:40.205 --> 14:41.773
Boy, if you're gonna
keep lying to me

14:41.807 --> 14:43.542
you gotta practice.

14:44.609 --> 14:45.544
Get off.

14:45.577 --> 14:48.246
What's wrong, huh?

14:48.280 --> 14:49.916
She said move your arm.

14:51.249 --> 14:52.617
Huh?

14:52.651 --> 14:54.120
She said move your arm.

14:56.155 --> 14:57.123
Get up.

14:57.156 --> 14:58.757
Get up.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:58.790 --> 14:59.758
Shut up.

15:01.259 --> 15:02.895
You know I have some
tricks of my own, too.

15:02.929 --> 15:06.264
Press a button, make a noise.

15:06.298 --> 15:08.835
Robbie, what was that
thing he made the phone do?

15:08.868 --> 15:09.869
Tweet tweet, right?

15:09.902 --> 15:10.702
Yeah.

15:10.736 --> 15:12.004
Yeah, tweet tweet.

15:12.038 --> 15:13.940
Now where is that button?

15:13.973 --> 15:15.340
Leave him alone.

15:17.609 --> 15:18.443
Wrong button.

15:20.213 --> 15:21.848
I guess we gotta
try another one.

15:21.881 --> 15:22.849
Ow, ow.

15:22.882 --> 15:23.682
Stop it.

15:23.715 --> 15:24.516
Yo, relax, yo.

15:24.549 --> 15:25.350
Calm her down.

15:25.383 --> 15:26.418
Do it.

15:26.451 --> 15:27.252
Okay, okay.

15:27.285 --> 15:28.121
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Tweet tweet.

15:28.154 --> 15:28.955
No, no, no.

15:28.988 --> 15:29.788
You didn't sell me there.

15:29.821 --> 15:30.622
You didn't sell me.

15:30.655 --> 15:31.891
Tweet tweet.

15:31.924 --> 15:32.724
What did you do with
my phone, Marcus?

15:32.758 --> 15:33.893
Nothing, I swear.

15:33.926 --> 15:34.994
Bullshit.

15:35.027 --> 15:35.895
Clay.

15:35.928 --> 15:36.728
You put some kind of
software on there,

15:36.762 --> 15:37.496
some kind of spy fucker?
No, no, no.

15:37.529 --> 15:38.898
It's just some stupid trick.

15:39.966 --> 15:43.836
Robbie, what was that
one he did in my phone?

15:45.537 --> 15:46.772
Uh huh.

15:47.639 --> 15:48.440
Yeah.

15:50.109 --> 15:52.410
Now where's that button?

15:56.015 --> 15:57.083
Stop!

15:57.116 --> 15:58.717
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.052
Let go of me.

16:00.086 --> 16:01.220
Hey, relax.

16:01.254 --> 16:02.454
Hey.
Let go of me!

16:02.487 --> 16:04.623
Quit it, hey relax.

16:11.264 --> 16:13.099
Don't you ever touch
my phone again.

16:13.132 --> 16:13.966
Clay!

16:20.106 --> 16:22.175
Hey, Cassie, what's up?

16:22.208 --> 16:23.475
What the hell are you doing?

16:23.508 --> 16:24.911
Oh, just having some fun.

16:24.944 --> 16:26.344
Okay, just having some fun?

16:26.378 --> 16:27.612
Are you kidding me?
Messing with the kid.

16:27.646 --> 16:28.480
Hey.

16:47.099 --> 16:48.167
What is it?

16:54.106 --> 16:55.407
Tweet tweet.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.575
Tweet tweet

16:56.608 --> 17:00.847
tweet tweet
tweet tweet.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.480
Just don't look at it.

17:02.514 --> 17:03.348
Give it to me.

17:09.754 --> 17:11.324
Come on.

17:20.132 --> 17:20.967
Come on.

17:23.501 --> 17:24.337
Come on.

17:29.641 --> 17:31.978
This is what we need to be
doing right now, really?

17:32.011 --> 17:33.846
Don't you want to
check your phone?

17:50.528 --> 17:52.464
Remember how long it took
for us to build this?

17:52.497 --> 17:54.934
Half of the summer
after sixth grade.

17:54.967 --> 17:56.269
We were gonna live here.

17:57.336 --> 17:59.138
Never go home.

17:59.171 --> 18:00.505
Doesn't work that way.

18:02.241 --> 18:04.210
I've got to go back to
that school tomorrow

18:04.243 --> 18:05.177
and they're all gonna
know that I'm the kid

18:05.211 --> 18:06.979
from the video who
got his ass beat

18:07.013 --> 18:08.247
and cried his guts out.

18:11.317 --> 18:13.152
I thought it would be
different at this school.

18:19.859 --> 18:23.728
Why don't we stop by the
hospital in the morning

18:23.762 --> 18:26.198
and just take a look at you.

18:26.232 --> 18:28.067
I'm fine, Ma, it
was just a fall.

18:29.035 --> 18:30.870
You gonna be okay
at that school?

18:30.903 --> 18:32.238
If it was good enough
for him, it's good enough

18:32.271 --> 18:33.172
for me, right?

18:34.206 --> 18:35.341
You talk to him lately?

18:36.375 --> 18:40.179
I was thinking today
that if he was around

18:40.212 --> 18:43.282
maybe we could afford
that school Grant goes to

18:43.316 --> 18:45.284
and maybe you'd have him around

18:45.318 --> 18:46.385
to talk to sometimes.

18:48.854 --> 18:50.323
I'm gonna go wash my hands.

19:36.735 --> 19:38.237
Yo, you should pick that up.

19:38.270 --> 19:41.340
Bananas are so good.

19:42.674 --> 19:47.079
Justin Weingarter, you're
always such a douche bag.

19:52.918 --> 19:53.752
Hey.

19:56.654 --> 19:59.291
I'm so sorry, I had no idea.

19:59.325 --> 20:00.926
He said he was just teasing you.

20:05.431 --> 20:06.531
I'm gonna kill him.

20:10.169 --> 20:13.272
He's not as tough as he
says he is, believe me.

20:17.943 --> 20:21.013
Hey, wait do you think
that he's the one

20:21.047 --> 20:23.382
that sent the video around
like from his phone?

20:28.620 --> 20:30.622
I'll find out what's up.

21:02.455 --> 21:04.990
You really think Clay
will listen to her?

21:05.024 --> 21:07.259
You think there's something
going on with them?

21:07.293 --> 21:08.160
Mister YouTube.

21:09.495 --> 21:12.398
Hey come on, give us some
of those tears, Oscar...

21:12.431 --> 21:13.532
All right, assholes.

21:20.039 --> 21:22.141
Clay, dude, dude.

21:22.174 --> 21:23.843
Awesome, how 'bout after school

21:23.876 --> 21:25.777
make this baby cry
some more, huh?

21:25.810 --> 21:27.712
Nah, man, I'm done
with that kid.

21:27.745 --> 21:29.915
Dude, fun's just getting
started, come on.

21:29.949 --> 21:31.150
Kid took a beating.

21:31.183 --> 21:34.053
He's a little ass dude but him
and his friends stood tall.

21:38.790 --> 21:41.127
How much of a beating you
think you'd take, Justin?

21:41.994 --> 21:43.162
Spit out the tater tot.

21:52.670 --> 21:53.705
Leave the kids alone.

22:10.990 --> 22:12.258
Why aren't you texting me back?

22:12.291 --> 22:13.192
'Cause you were away.

22:13.225 --> 22:14.026
'Cause I was away?

22:14.059 --> 22:14.860
I'm playing basketball.

22:14.894 --> 22:16.295
Nothing happened!

22:16.328 --> 22:17.129
What happened with you and Clay?

22:17.163 --> 22:18.030
Nothing happened.
Be honest.

22:18.063 --> 22:19.465
What do you mean nothing?

22:19.498 --> 22:20.633
Why do I keep hearing his name?

22:20.665 --> 22:21.634
Okay, okay, fine.
Were you with him?

22:21.666 --> 22:24.036
- Fine, yes.
- What?

22:24.069 --> 22:26.105
How could you do that?

22:33.279 --> 22:34.914
I'm just terrified
to see him again...

22:34.947 --> 22:35.780
Cassie.

22:36.849 --> 22:38.716
Marcus, hey.

22:40.685 --> 22:41.719
I'll just be a sec.

22:43.155 --> 22:45.591
Hey, you wanted me to check
your work for the test?

22:45.624 --> 22:48.093
Oh yeah, thank you so much.

22:51.230 --> 22:53.698
I should, I should go.

22:53.731 --> 22:56.502
Cassie, are you okay?

22:57.536 --> 23:01.574
I saw you and Bryan
and are you okay?

23:04.776 --> 23:08.380
Whatever you said
to Clay it worked.

23:08.414 --> 23:10.249
What happened, what
did he say to you?

23:10.282 --> 23:11.783
Marcus.

23:11.816 --> 23:14.386
He just, these kids
were picking on me

23:14.420 --> 23:16.821
and he told them to
back off and they did.

23:19.358 --> 23:21.860
Listen, be careful
with him, okay?

23:21.894 --> 23:26.065
I trusted him and then I
found out that I shouldn't.

23:27.299 --> 23:29.301
Found things that he
was hiding from me.

23:30.135 --> 23:33.405
Just watch your back, okay?

23:34.340 --> 23:35.674
Cassie.

23:35.708 --> 23:36.542
Oh my god.

23:51.624 --> 23:53.459
- Get him.
- Yeah.

24:16.781 --> 24:17.616
Come on!

24:18.816 --> 24:19.985
Let's go.

24:24.189 --> 24:26.258
Oh my god.

24:26.292 --> 24:27.259
Out of the way, out of the way.

24:27.293 --> 24:29.295
Get out of the way.

24:29.328 --> 24:30.663
Oh my god.

24:46.045 --> 24:47.079
Did you see what happened?

24:47.112 --> 24:49.915
Yeah, did you see
what Cassie did after?

26:40.860 --> 26:41.693
Oh, hey.

26:43.295 --> 26:47.132
Good morning, hi my
girl, hi my girl, yes.

27:02.147 --> 27:03.649
Up early.

27:03.682 --> 27:05.818
Given you don't need
to be at school today.

27:06.819 --> 27:08.454
How are those
college apps going?

27:10.556 --> 27:11.390
Prodigious.

27:13.592 --> 27:14.660
That's an SAT word.

27:19.164 --> 27:20.732
I'm going out.

27:20.766 --> 27:22.968
I think maybe you
should stay in,

27:23.001 --> 27:26.405
use this unfortunate incident
to think about your future.

27:26.438 --> 27:27.806
I'm good, thanks.

27:29.575 --> 27:30.409
Hey.

27:31.510 --> 27:32.344
Hey!

27:33.212 --> 27:34.613
I meant what I said last night.

27:34.646 --> 27:35.714
You don't get into
college you're not

27:35.747 --> 27:36.950
gonna live here anymore.

27:38.050 --> 27:40.619
So, mister SAT word, what
are you gonna do then?

27:42.187 --> 27:43.589
I'm gonna be fine.

27:44.690 --> 27:47.192
You had your way, I've got mine.

27:49.863 --> 27:52.164
I didn't walk the dog.

28:11.250 --> 28:14.520
Hey, it's Cassie,
leave a message.

29:23.522 --> 29:24.323
For what?

29:24.356 --> 29:26.258
These fools are 100 grand a day.

29:26.291 --> 29:27.860
To sit at a fucking
desk all day,

29:27.894 --> 29:29.595
pay that shit off in 10 years?

29:29.628 --> 29:30.830
That's chump shit, man.

29:30.863 --> 29:34.199
We're gonna be making 100
grand, 100 grand next year,

29:34.232 --> 29:35.167
you feel me?

29:45.711 --> 29:47.112
Nice shooting, tex.

29:51.884 --> 29:52.718
So.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.788
How come you didn't
ask for no re-up?

29:56.822 --> 29:58.024
I will when I need it.

29:59.658 --> 30:01.426
Is that what you
want me to tell Will?

30:04.097 --> 30:05.364
You know what he's been to you?

30:06.331 --> 30:10.402
Kind and Will aint
known for being kind.

30:10.435 --> 30:13.438
He gave you muscle,
took all this territory

30:13.472 --> 30:14.539
for you to push our shit.

30:14.573 --> 30:16.208
'Cause your pretty
ass looks right

30:16.241 --> 30:18.377
walking up them
big county lawns.

30:18.410 --> 30:20.278
Is that what
happened to Darnell?

30:23.482 --> 30:25.784
I'ma forget you said that

30:25.817 --> 30:28.453
and you gave you
product, good product,

30:28.487 --> 30:30.489
for you to sell.

30:32.658 --> 30:35.394
Yeah, we are selling
it, all right?

30:35.427 --> 30:36.261
All of it.

30:37.462 --> 30:38.296
Sell more.

30:39.531 --> 30:41.968
You asked for this
deal, remember?

30:48.473 --> 30:50.208
Here's the thing
about stepping up.

30:51.144 --> 30:52.945
You could say you're gonna,

30:52.979 --> 30:54.680
you could think you're gonna.

30:54.713 --> 30:56.949
Only part that
matters is the doing.

30:56.983 --> 30:59.152
You do, we're
gonna be all right.

30:59.184 --> 31:00.019
You don't.

31:04.489 --> 31:06.025
Big man wants to see you later.

31:07.960 --> 31:09.261
Yeah, for what?

31:09.294 --> 31:10.129
You'll see.

31:11.296 --> 31:13.833
Well lookie here, lookie here.

31:18.370 --> 31:19.371
Who's bike is this?

31:22.175 --> 31:23.475
Okay.

31:23.508 --> 31:25.144
Nephew birthday coming.

31:58.978 --> 32:00.146
Rough night?

32:01.413 --> 32:02.280
What do you want, man?

32:02.314 --> 32:03.682
We shouldn't meet
in public like this.

32:05.617 --> 32:07.319
Cassie's missing.

32:07.352 --> 32:08.720
She didn't come home last night.

32:08.754 --> 32:09.721
I thought you might
know something.

32:09.755 --> 32:10.555
Where were you?

32:10.589 --> 32:11.790
What do you mean missing?

32:12.859 --> 32:15.194
All right, give me your
license and your registration

32:15.228 --> 32:17.230
in case somebody's looking.

32:20.599 --> 32:21.600
Is she in trouble?

32:23.836 --> 32:25.403
I just don't know where she is.

32:25.437 --> 32:27.106
The captains on it, they
brought that boyfriend

32:27.140 --> 32:27.940
of hers in for questioning.

32:27.974 --> 32:30.375
Oh what and I'm next, Officer?

32:32.410 --> 32:34.312
You don't want me
in that room, man.

32:34.346 --> 32:35.647
They start asking questions,

32:35.680 --> 32:37.449
you know where they're gonna go.

32:37.482 --> 32:38.416
Is that a threat?

32:40.052 --> 32:41.220
Where do they think she is?

32:41.254 --> 32:42.654
You don't get to
ask the questions...

32:42.687 --> 32:43.488
And you don't get
to play cop with me.

32:43.522 --> 32:45.323
I could snap you
like a fucking twig.

32:45.357 --> 32:46.525
It's a good thing
I'm not a twig.

32:46.558 --> 32:48.426
Jesus, you think that I
don't have enough problems

32:48.460 --> 32:50.295
at the department without
you crawling up my ass?

32:50.328 --> 32:52.198
You know who I work for, man.

32:52.231 --> 32:53.132
All right?

32:53.166 --> 32:54.800
You know how this works.

32:54.834 --> 32:56.035
You know my man
in the city, Will,

32:56.068 --> 32:57.970
has a copy of that
sealed testimony,

32:58.004 --> 32:58.804
knows what really
happened between you

32:58.838 --> 33:00.639
and that kid a few years back.

33:00.672 --> 33:02.507
How the PD covered that shit up,

33:02.541 --> 33:04.743
paid off the parents, kept
it from going to trial.

33:04.776 --> 33:06.745
So if you want to keep
that shit out of the papers

33:06.778 --> 33:09.748
and keep that shiny little
badge, you give me information.

33:09.781 --> 33:11.650
That's how it works, that's
how it's always worked.

33:11.683 --> 33:13.953
I told you that I would
give you information

33:13.986 --> 33:16.022
about local drug dealers.

33:16.055 --> 33:18.590
This shit is not
part of our deal.

33:18.623 --> 33:19.491
It is now.

33:22.195 --> 33:24.964
Tell me what you know.

33:26.032 --> 33:28.533
Look at me, I got busted
back to a patrol car.

33:28.567 --> 33:29.768
They don't even let me
in the room anymore.

33:29.801 --> 33:30.837
Get back in the room.

33:30.870 --> 33:31.971
Oh, okay.

33:32.004 --> 33:34.941
Find out everything they
know or I'm making the call.

33:41.080 --> 33:46.052
This one, you can really
see her, her face.

33:48.054 --> 33:51.623
This one, it's, that's what
she really looks like now.

33:52.591 --> 33:54.927
Can you use all three?

33:54.961 --> 33:55.895
Sure.

33:55.928 --> 33:57.263
Jeanie, that's a good idea.

33:59.031 --> 34:00.233
Do I get them back?

34:00.266 --> 34:01.366
Of course.

34:05.804 --> 34:06.605
Good to see you.

34:06.638 --> 34:07.940
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:07.974 --> 34:09.842
I drove Cassie's parents here.

34:09.876 --> 34:11.409
Nobody will tell me anything.

34:11.443 --> 34:12.245
What have you heard?

34:12.278 --> 34:13.478
Nothing new.

34:13.511 --> 34:15.081
Uh, hey.

34:15.114 --> 34:19.018
I didn't tell anyone about
what happened at the party.

34:20.119 --> 34:21.720
Yeah, good don't.

34:23.555 --> 34:26.893
Can I get my phone call already?

34:32.031 --> 34:33.199
- Sergeant.
- Ma'am.

34:35.201 --> 34:36.168
They found you.

34:36.202 --> 34:38.770
Yeah, I was out on route
40, out of radio range.

34:39.638 --> 34:42.141
I need someone to canvas
Cassie's neighborhood.

34:42.174 --> 34:43.142
Canvas?

34:43.175 --> 34:43.976
Any uniform can do that.

34:44.010 --> 34:44.977
Yeah, shoe fits.

34:45.912 --> 34:48.114
Ma'am, Captain, Katherine.

34:52.651 --> 34:53.485
Let me help.

34:56.155 --> 34:58.024
I know you don't
trust me, all right,

34:58.057 --> 35:01.060
but I chose this job
to do good, I did,

35:01.093 --> 35:03.863
it's just most days
job aint about that.

35:06.332 --> 35:07.699
Let me help.

35:07.732 --> 35:09.634
Colonel's still looking
for a place to put you.

35:09.668 --> 35:10.535
I don't know how
long you'll be here.

35:10.568 --> 35:11.770
Well, I'm here now.

35:11.803 --> 35:14.773
So if I'm here in this

35:14.806 --> 35:17.944
and I'm not out there doing
what any first year could do.

35:17.977 --> 35:19.412
I'm the best in the room.

35:19.444 --> 35:20.512
Even you know that.

35:26.385 --> 35:28.586
You can be good
police on this one?

35:28.620 --> 35:31.523
Yes, that's what
I signed up for.

35:31.556 --> 35:33.059
I signed up for the pension.

35:36.862 --> 35:38.763
When was the last
time you saw Cassie?

35:41.766 --> 35:42.567
You gotta think about that one?

35:42.600 --> 35:43.436
No I...

35:45.037 --> 35:45.838
Why?

35:45.871 --> 35:47.605
Just answer the question.

35:47.639 --> 35:49.041
Yesterday at school.

35:49.075 --> 35:51.377
Yesterday got exciting,
I hear Clay Howard...

35:51.410 --> 35:52.244
He's a dick.

35:53.611 --> 35:55.314
We had a disagreement.

35:55.348 --> 35:56.648
We're gonna need more than that.

35:56.681 --> 35:58.117
Is this about him?

35:58.150 --> 35:59.051
Figures.

35:59.085 --> 36:01.420
I told you, he's a dick.

36:01.454 --> 36:02.554
Answer her question.

36:05.690 --> 36:07.093
It was about Cassie.

36:07.126 --> 36:08.928
She's your girlfriend, right?

36:10.363 --> 36:11.796
She was.

36:11.831 --> 36:13.165
Was?

36:13.199 --> 36:15.533
Did that dick have
something to do with that?

36:16.768 --> 36:18.070
That must have pissed you off.

36:18.104 --> 36:20.439
When was the last time
you saw Cassie, exactly?

36:21.506 --> 36:22.441
At school at the fight.

36:22.475 --> 36:24.310
You talk to her after that?

36:24.343 --> 36:26.345
I texted her, she
didn't text back.

36:26.379 --> 36:28.114
Where were you last night?

36:28.147 --> 36:29.382
Out.
Out?

36:29.415 --> 36:31.816
Yeah, went out for a drive.

36:32.985 --> 36:34.519
All night?

36:34.552 --> 36:36.188
Y'all know how much
longer this gonna be?

36:36.222 --> 36:38.324
I got a game tonight.

36:38.357 --> 36:39.425
I think the warriors
are gonna have

36:39.458 --> 36:41.394
to do without tonight, Bryan.

36:43.462 --> 36:44.263
Yeah?

36:44.296 --> 36:45.630
We got something.

36:53.805 --> 36:55.408
Long night, you get any sleep?

36:55.441 --> 36:56.409
Not bad.

36:56.442 --> 36:57.776
My husband got that
snore strap, so.

36:57.809 --> 36:58.844
I didn't know they worked.

36:58.878 --> 36:59.879
Yeah.

36:59.912 --> 37:00.779
All right, so we
got a 2006 Sonata,

37:00.812 --> 37:02.882
it's registered
to Aaron Williams.

37:04.316 --> 37:05.683
Recover anything?

37:05.717 --> 37:06.952
Odds and ends.

37:06.986 --> 37:10.456
Receipts, non recent, some old
workout clothes in the trunk.

37:10.489 --> 37:11.290
Prints?

37:11.323 --> 37:12.358
Dusting.

37:12.391 --> 37:13.758
No prints on the steering wheel.

37:13.792 --> 37:15.027
It looks like it's
been wiped clean.

37:15.061 --> 37:15.895
Intentionally?

37:19.597 --> 37:21.233
Why the hell would
she come out here?

37:22.468 --> 37:23.269
Come on.

37:23.302 --> 37:24.103
It's cold.

37:24.136 --> 37:25.570
It's like 80 degrees out.

37:25.603 --> 37:26.805
I don't have a swimsuit.

37:26.839 --> 37:27.772
So?

37:31.510 --> 37:32.511
I'm going in.

37:32.545 --> 37:34.813
Go ahead, prep school.

37:37.316 --> 37:38.583
Holly!

37:45.824 --> 37:46.859
Dudes!

37:46.892 --> 37:47.927
Baltimore.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.295
We are on the scene.

37:49.328 --> 37:50.129
Come on, what is it?

37:50.162 --> 37:51.530
My god.

37:51.564 --> 37:52.531
That's Cassie's car.

37:52.565 --> 37:54.133
What if something
did happen to her?

37:54.166 --> 37:55.568
Why would something
of happened to her?

37:55.600 --> 37:57.903
A lot has been going
on the past few days.

37:57.937 --> 37:58.904
Like what?

37:58.938 --> 38:00.239
Well, if you actually
talked to your friends

38:00.272 --> 38:02.174
when you were off from your
fancy country club school

38:02.208 --> 38:04.110
you'd know, wouldn't you?

38:04.143 --> 38:07.980
For now, channel
seven signing off.

38:28.334 --> 38:29.301
Did you find her?

38:33.105 --> 38:34.173
Hey, scooch.

38:35.107 --> 38:36.808
I'm fine.

38:36.842 --> 38:38.710
You're not.

38:38.743 --> 38:39.545
It's okay.

38:39.578 --> 38:43.916
It's okay to be not
fine, sometimes.

38:45.217 --> 38:46.318
You're always fine.

38:49.488 --> 38:50.322
I'm not.

38:52.591 --> 38:55.828
Sometimes I think I don't even
want to do this job anymore.

38:55.861 --> 38:56.728
Yeah, you do.

38:58.497 --> 39:00.399
I didn't always.

39:00.432 --> 39:02.800
I was gonna be a teacher.

39:02.835 --> 39:04.503
Then you came along.

39:08.673 --> 39:10.808
We didn't want to tell you

39:10.843 --> 39:12.278
and we were hoping that you,

39:14.246 --> 39:15.881
that you wouldn't remember

39:16.882 --> 39:20.818
but when you were little

39:22.588 --> 39:23.889
I was getting groceries.

39:24.722 --> 39:28.427
I had finished loading
the car and I had you

39:28.460 --> 39:30.996
in your car seat and
your pink bunny blanket

39:31.030 --> 39:33.065
wrapped up like a
burrito with legs.

39:34.133 --> 39:36.902
Just your little
face peeking out.

39:36.936 --> 39:40.639
I went around to the
driver side and I,

39:40.673 --> 39:43.509
I got in and I started to
put my key in the ignition

39:43.542 --> 39:45.978
and a man opened the door.

39:46.946 --> 39:50.683
I looked down and he had a knife

39:51.716 --> 39:53.751
and he said, "Drive."

39:55.221 --> 39:58.357
So, I drove.

40:00.326 --> 40:01.694
I looked in the rear view mirror

40:01.726 --> 40:04.463
and I had the mirror set
up so I that I could,

40:05.763 --> 40:10.768
I could see your face and
you were just smiling at me.

40:13.805 --> 40:16.609
We got to a red light

40:16.642 --> 40:20.312
and this man looks out the
window just for a second

40:21.180 --> 40:26.185
and I see a patrol
car on the other side

40:27.419 --> 40:29.488
and he hasn't seen it yet

40:31.523 --> 40:35.760
and suddenly I take
his head and I,

40:37.029 --> 40:39.565
I slam it into the dashboard.

40:39.598 --> 40:44.603
I've never done anything
like that before, ever,

40:45.604 --> 40:48.607
and he, he slashed
at me with the knife,

40:48.641 --> 40:52.845
I put my arms up
and he cuts my arm,

40:52.878 --> 40:54.280
there's blood everywhere

40:54.313 --> 40:56.315
and I unbuckled you faster

40:56.348 --> 40:58.350
than I have ever
unbuckled you before

40:58.384 --> 40:59.718
and I had you in my arms

40:59.752 --> 41:00.785
and he grabbed for you

41:00.818 --> 41:03.788
and I pulled him away
from you so hard.

41:03.821 --> 41:07.092
I ran so hard towards
that patrol car

41:07.126 --> 41:09.561
and there was blood
going down the blanket

41:09.595 --> 41:10.896
and the officers face went white

41:10.929 --> 41:15.100
and I, I turned around

41:16.769 --> 41:19.972
and the guy was running, he
was running around the car

41:20.005 --> 41:22.941
to try and get away and
the other officer was there

41:24.076 --> 41:28.013
with her gun drawn and that
man kneeled in front of her

41:35.854 --> 41:39.958
and the other officer came
around and he cuffed him

41:45.164 --> 41:47.533
and I didn't want to
be a teacher anymore.

41:50.536 --> 41:53.372
I've been on this
job for 17 years

41:56.742 --> 42:01.113
and bad things are still
happening in this town

42:01.146 --> 42:02.581
and I...

42:06.652 --> 42:09.154
And I can't stop them.

42:32.177 --> 42:33.312
Give me the damn phone!

42:33.345 --> 42:35.047
Oh my god, are you serious?

42:35.080 --> 42:36.081
You don't want me
to come over there

42:36.115 --> 42:36.915
and take it from you.

42:36.949 --> 42:37.783
It's getting worse.

42:38.984 --> 42:40.486
You can stay at my house.

42:40.519 --> 42:41.887
I'll talk to my mom,
she'll be cool with it.

42:41.920 --> 42:42.755
I'll be fine.

42:44.656 --> 42:48.227
Marcus, you have to tell
someone what you saw.

42:48.260 --> 42:50.662
The cops, your mom, somebody.

42:53.465 --> 42:55.134
What if Clay finds out?

42:56.301 --> 42:58.570
The guys still have my bike.

42:58.604 --> 43:01.073
What if she's out there?

43:01.106 --> 43:02.374
You can help find her.

43:05.177 --> 43:06.211
Just 'cause it's the hard thing

43:06.245 --> 43:08.147
doesn't mean it's
not the right thing.

43:12.017 --> 43:12.852
Team Dork?

43:14.720 --> 43:15.721
Team Dork.

43:22.194 --> 43:23.996
May I be excused?

43:24.029 --> 43:27.901
That is pizza from Scatinos.

43:27.933 --> 43:30.035
You had like two bites
and there isn't a piece

43:30.068 --> 43:31.603
of broccoli on that thing.

43:31.637 --> 43:32.771
I'm not hungry.

43:32.805 --> 43:35.875
You may be excused when you
finish the food you took.

43:52.591 --> 43:53.725
May I be excused?

44:00.766 --> 44:02.534
You do remember I gave birth
to you that time, right?

44:02.568 --> 44:03.903
What?

44:03.937 --> 44:05.304
You come home from
school the first day

44:05.337 --> 44:08.640
with cuts on your face, tell
me you fell playing soccer

44:08.674 --> 44:09.608
and you don't even play soccer.

44:09.641 --> 44:11.043
I do sometimes.
Then you come home tonight

44:11.076 --> 44:13.979
and won't say two words
and boy I am trying

44:14.012 --> 44:15.247
to let you do your
thing your way

44:15.280 --> 44:18.250
but if something is wrong,
you gotta talk to me.

44:18.283 --> 44:19.218
Nothing is wrong.

44:19.251 --> 44:20.920
I am not stupid.

44:20.954 --> 44:22.054
I finished my food.

44:22.087 --> 44:22.889
Why won't you just let me go?

44:22.922 --> 44:23.989
Whatever you are dealing with,

44:24.022 --> 44:25.757
you don't have to
do it on your own.

44:25.791 --> 44:26.758
You're just a kid.

44:26.792 --> 44:28.895
I may be just a kid but
I'm not stupid, either.

44:28.928 --> 44:29.728
I didn't say that.

44:29.761 --> 44:30.696
I understand shit.

44:30.729 --> 44:31.663
Language.

44:31.697 --> 44:32.798
I have to understand.

44:32.832 --> 44:34.266
If I'm just a kid than
how come I take care

44:34.299 --> 44:35.634
of myself all the damn time?

44:35.667 --> 44:37.369
Oh you take care of yourself?

44:37.402 --> 44:38.872
Yeah, 'cause you're never here.

44:38.905 --> 44:40.339
Because I am out
making the money

44:40.372 --> 44:41.607
that puts the food on the table.

44:41.640 --> 44:43.008
You grabbing your
lunch out of the fridge

44:43.041 --> 44:44.911
in the morning is not you
taking care of yourself.

44:44.944 --> 44:46.778
I'm on my own at that school.

44:46.812 --> 44:49.047
I'm the one that has to
survive there for four years.

44:49.081 --> 44:49.883
Me not you.

44:49.916 --> 44:51.817
You do not have
to be on your own.

44:51.851 --> 44:52.919
I am trying to help you.

44:52.952 --> 44:54.319
Maybe I don't want your help.

44:54.353 --> 44:56.822
It is my job to help
you, I am your mama.

44:56.856 --> 44:58.457
Maybe I don't want a mama.

45:17.042 --> 45:18.477
You're excused.

45:19.511 --> 45:21.113
That thing you said about dad,

45:22.882 --> 45:24.884
I think about it for
you, too sometimes.

45:26.585 --> 45:28.453
Maybe if he was
still around you'd...

45:32.190 --> 45:32.992
Marcus.

45:33.026 --> 45:34.192
I know, I wasn't really supposed

45:34.226 --> 45:37.162
to happen when I did and maybe
you'd have a better life...

45:37.195 --> 45:39.698
Marcus, that is not what this...

45:39.731 --> 45:41.767
Don't lie about it with me.

45:41.800 --> 45:43.068
Just tell me the truth.

45:43.101 --> 45:44.403
I'm not a kid anymore.

45:44.436 --> 45:46.138
I'm not stupid.

45:57.282 --> 45:59.351
No, you are not stupid.

46:01.119 --> 46:04.189
You are so smart, I don't
even know where it comes from.

46:06.893 --> 46:08.594
But you don't know
everything yet.

46:09.862 --> 46:12.097
Relationships aren't
a solid thing.

46:13.265 --> 46:16.869
They get tested, they bend,

46:18.170 --> 46:19.471
then you see if they break

46:22.741 --> 46:24.142
and if you haven't used too much

46:24.176 --> 46:28.413
that is because the raw
material was not strong enough.

46:29.748 --> 46:33.385
Your daddy, he said
a lot of things.

46:38.523 --> 46:41.894
But a man is not what he says.

46:44.162 --> 46:45.263
He's what he does.

46:47.934 --> 46:50.502
Your daddy wasn't
ready for doing.

46:55.140 --> 46:55.975
Now tell me,

46:57.376 --> 46:59.444
what the hell is
going on with you?

47:04.683 --> 47:05.817
Marcus.

47:10.089 --> 47:12.157
Good evening, I am
Captain Katherine Hilman

47:12.190 --> 47:14.526
with the Baltimore County
Police Department's

47:14.559 --> 47:16.762
Criminal Investigative Division.

47:16.795 --> 47:19.431
Yesterday, at
approximately 8:16 PM,

47:19.464 --> 47:20.867
Cassandra "Cassie" Williams

47:20.900 --> 47:23.802
was reported missing by her
mother, Jeanie Williams.

47:23.836 --> 47:25.838
Cassie was last seen
yesterday about three PM,

47:25.872 --> 47:28.740
by her boyfriend, Bryan Santini.

47:28.774 --> 47:32.210
Today, a car owned by Aaron
Williams, Cassie's father,

47:32.244 --> 47:34.914
was discovered in a
parking lot off route 40.

47:34.947 --> 47:36.381
Holly, answer your damn phone.

47:36.415 --> 47:38.750
Searches of the area
are being conducted.

47:38.784 --> 47:42.521
At this time, Cassie is
considered a missing person.

47:42.554 --> 47:44.189
We will continue
to conduct searches

47:44.222 --> 47:45.992
and follow all leads
as they come...

47:48.861 --> 47:50.395
Clay!

47:50.429 --> 47:51.898
We are reconstructing a timeline

47:51.931 --> 47:53.732
of Cassie's whereabouts
in the 24 hours

47:53.765 --> 47:54.867
before she disappeared.

47:54.901 --> 47:55.868
Go.

47:55.902 --> 47:57.170
If you have any
information whatsoever

47:57.202 --> 47:59.404
or saw her in the last 24 hours,

47:59.438 --> 48:01.440
please contact our tip line,

48:01.473 --> 48:04.977
no matter how minute
or small it may seem.

48:07.013 --> 48:10.315
We will follow up on
every lead and tip.

48:20.425 --> 48:21.693
Baltimore County Police.

48:21.727 --> 48:24.496
Hi, I have information
on that missing girl.

48:27.365 --> 48:28.300
Go ahead.

48:36.374 --> 48:37.809
I threw rocks.

48:37.844 --> 48:39.578
Why didn't you say
something or text?

48:39.611 --> 48:40.746
I did text.

48:42.148 --> 48:43.348
Oh.

48:43.381 --> 48:44.884
Could you help me, please?

48:47.819 --> 48:49.321
Oh shit, sorry.

48:49.354 --> 48:51.623
It's okay, mom's
on the night shift.

48:53.926 --> 48:56.028
You okay?

48:56.062 --> 48:58.197
I want to go to Fort Invincible.

49:29.795 --> 49:30.762
Do you need help?

49:30.796 --> 49:31.864
I got it, got it.

49:31.898 --> 49:34.200
There you go.

49:41.007 --> 49:42.440
Having fun there?

49:43.575 --> 49:44.743
He's pissed.

49:47.612 --> 49:48.713
What happened?

49:48.747 --> 49:52.185
He was all pissed because
he'd been calling me

49:52.218 --> 49:54.386
and I'd been ignoring him.

49:55.687 --> 49:57.422
He said with
everything going on,

49:57.455 --> 49:59.591
he don't want me
going out at all.

50:00.893 --> 50:02.295
It aint safe.

50:03.830 --> 50:05.965
And I was like, I
can't be locked in here

50:05.998 --> 50:08.500
with you two fighting, no way.

50:10.368 --> 50:11.304
He flipped out.

50:12.337 --> 50:16.474
Threw a lamp at the
wall, sent me to my room.

50:16.508 --> 50:19.879
I got out of that window
as fast as I could.

50:19.912 --> 50:22.114
They're so messed up.

50:22.148 --> 50:25.218
It's like, I don't
even got a family.

50:29.922 --> 50:30.990
But you do.

50:32.291 --> 50:33.458
You've got me.

50:35.560 --> 50:37.830
You know I love you, right?

50:39.497 --> 50:40.665
You love me?

50:42.201 --> 50:43.035
Yeah.

50:44.971 --> 50:46.705
What do you mean?

50:46.738 --> 50:49.075
I mean, I mean I love you.

51:23.175 --> 51:24.043
I'm gonna go pee.

51:34.220 --> 51:35.054
You okay?

51:38.858 --> 51:40.492
You'll talk to
him but not to me?

51:40.525 --> 51:42.094
Well, he's been around.

51:42.128 --> 51:43.296
It's been like two days.

51:44.663 --> 51:45.998
I miss you guys.

51:46.032 --> 51:48.834
Then why didn't you
come to hell house?

51:48.868 --> 51:49.969
If you had come
maybe that wouldn't

51:50.002 --> 51:50.836
of happened to Marcus.

51:50.870 --> 51:52.305
I didn't know that
was gonna happen.

51:52.338 --> 51:53.139
You said you would come.

51:53.172 --> 51:54.739
I said I might come.

51:54.773 --> 51:56.842
I met some kids at school,
we were hanging out.

51:56.876 --> 51:59.444
It's always about you,
you're so selfish.

51:59.477 --> 52:02.048
Just 'cause I have other
stuff going on in my life?

52:02.081 --> 52:03.049
Good stuff.

52:03.082 --> 52:04.984
That doesn't mean I'm
not still your friend.

52:05.017 --> 52:06.484
Well, a friend would
have been there.

52:09.754 --> 52:10.588
It's fine.

52:11.656 --> 52:13.159
Me and Marcus can deal.

52:14.260 --> 52:15.194
We have each other.

52:18.364 --> 52:20.199
What does that mean?

52:21.267 --> 52:26.272
He said he loves me.

52:26.705 --> 52:29.075
He loves you?

52:29.108 --> 52:30.608
Loves you like how?

52:39.385 --> 52:40.685
I've always...

52:44.123 --> 52:45.690
What about Brandy Torgenson?

52:49.428 --> 52:50.963
Screw Brandy Torgenson.

52:58.971 --> 53:00.638
Shit.
No, wait, wait, wait.

53:05.510 --> 53:06.745
Marcus, wait.

53:13.019 --> 53:18.024
Marcus!

53:38.543 --> 53:39.512
Marcus?

53:39.544 --> 53:42.448
Holly.

53:47.386 --> 53:49.422
Sorry about...

54:17.149 --> 54:17.983
Goodbye.

54:30.830 --> 54:31.629
What are you guys looking at?

54:31.663 --> 54:33.466
Get down.

54:33.499 --> 54:34.567
Clay, Clay.

54:35.968 --> 54:39.872
I heard something, there's
something out there.

54:41.440 --> 54:42.942
Did you hear that?

56:11.997 --> 56:13.032
Hey.

56:13.065 --> 56:16.001
Got you guys some hot chocolate.

56:16.035 --> 56:19.004
Thought that this might
warm you up, there you go.

56:22.575 --> 56:26.811
So I heard that you, you
guys maybe saw something

56:26.845 --> 56:29.215
tonight that you didn't
want to see, is that right?

56:32.051 --> 56:34.920
Maybe you can tell
me about that?

56:36.922 --> 56:38.023
Hey.

56:38.057 --> 56:39.592
We were able to get ahold
of all of your parents

56:39.625 --> 56:41.793
and they are on their way.

56:41.827 --> 56:43.462
If it's all right with
them, can you take us back

56:43.495 --> 56:44.396
to where you were?

56:45.898 --> 56:48.133
Okay, I have a file
on Clay Howard.

56:48.167 --> 56:50.569
You said that he had a
relationship with Cassie?

56:50.603 --> 56:52.605
I don't know, it
looked like that.

56:52.638 --> 56:55.807
I mean, I said that on
the phone yesterday.

56:55.841 --> 56:56.909
The phone?

56:56.942 --> 56:59.211
I called and said I
had seen her the day

56:59.245 --> 57:01.180
she disappeared at school.

57:01.213 --> 57:02.715
You called here?

57:02.747 --> 57:04.250
Yeah.

57:04.283 --> 57:06.619
Do you remember
who you talked to?

57:06.652 --> 57:07.886
Not sure.

57:07.920 --> 57:10.923
It was male or female,
man or a woman?

57:10.956 --> 57:11.857
Male.

57:11.890 --> 57:13.025
That's good.

57:13.058 --> 57:13.993
Can you please check that out?

57:17.296 --> 57:19.764
You guys are doing great.

58:15.154 --> 58:16.355
You son of a bitch.

58:16.388 --> 58:17.356
You son of a bitch!

58:17.389 --> 58:18.257
Holly.
No, no.

58:18.290 --> 58:19.291
You defend him?

58:19.325 --> 58:20.392
Hey, you don't push your mother!

58:20.426 --> 58:22.061
That's enough, that's enough.

58:25.831 --> 58:27.766
Suns coming up, let's go.

58:30.402 --> 58:31.236
After you.

58:32.738 --> 58:33.639
We'll be right behind you.

58:39.745 --> 58:40.579
Okay?

58:42.081 --> 58:43.082
All right, let's go.

59:27.793 --> 59:29.128
Here.

59:29.161 --> 59:30.562
Thank you.

59:57.857 --> 59:59.191
You mad at me?

1:00:02.494 --> 1:00:03.695
I'm scared.

1:00:05.531 --> 1:00:07.366
To think you were there,
so close to all that

1:00:07.399 --> 1:00:08.801
and I had no idea.

1:00:12.204 --> 1:00:13.772
Can't believe she's dead.

1:00:23.649 --> 1:00:27.653
I can only imagine what
they're going through.

1:00:34.059 --> 1:00:34.960
Looks like a kind
of contamination

1:00:34.993 --> 1:00:37.396
but unfortunately
that is exactly

1:00:37.429 --> 1:00:38.797
what we're looking at right now.

1:00:38.832 --> 1:00:40.065
Here, lab results from his car.

1:00:40.098 --> 1:00:42.601
And the, some of the
dirt looks brushed over

1:00:42.634 --> 1:00:44.736
which means someone was trying
to cover up their tracks,

1:00:44.770 --> 1:00:45.737
like literally.

1:00:47.439 --> 1:00:49.341
Did you find out
who took that call?

1:00:49.374 --> 1:00:50.976
No, there's no record of it.

1:00:51.009 --> 1:00:53.245
You sure the kid called it in?

1:00:53.278 --> 1:00:54.948
Why would he lie?

1:00:54.980 --> 1:00:55.915
Ask around.

1:00:57.583 --> 1:00:59.384
What you find out about the car?

1:00:59.418 --> 1:01:00.552
My guess is it's a small SUV...

1:01:23.977 --> 1:01:26.111
All right, we got something.

1:01:26.144 --> 1:01:28.480
Come on everybody, let's go.

1:01:48.100 --> 1:01:50.435
It smell like smoke to you?

1:01:50.469 --> 1:01:51.670
Go see what you can see.

1:01:56.241 --> 1:01:57.977
Hello, officers.

1:01:58.011 --> 1:01:59.511
This is the captain.

1:02:01.313 --> 1:02:02.147
Okay.

1:02:03.115 --> 1:02:03.983
You Clay Howard?

1:02:05.517 --> 1:02:06.986
Cleaning up?

1:02:07.020 --> 1:02:07.819
It's a shower, yeah.

1:02:07.854 --> 1:02:08.687
At noon?

1:02:09.621 --> 1:02:11.356
No school, two days suspension.

1:02:11.390 --> 1:02:13.191
Burning something
in the back there?

1:02:14.459 --> 1:02:15.561
Just lunch.

1:02:15.594 --> 1:02:16.963
Look, can I help you?

1:02:16.996 --> 1:02:18.430
Get dressed.

1:02:18.463 --> 1:02:19.765
We'll talk at the station.

1:02:20.833 --> 1:02:21.667
No.

1:02:27.907 --> 1:02:29.541
Excuse me?

1:02:29.575 --> 1:02:31.677
I'm sorry but unless you're
arresting me for something

1:02:31.710 --> 1:02:33.612
I suggest you
speak to my lawyer.

1:02:33.645 --> 1:02:34.446
You have a lawyer?

1:02:34.479 --> 1:02:35.280
I will in an hour.

1:02:36.481 --> 1:02:38.250
We're just trying
to help Cassie.

1:02:39.151 --> 1:02:40.887
Don't you want to help her?

1:02:40.920 --> 1:02:43.121
Lady, I know my rights.

1:02:43.155 --> 1:02:44.857
What's going on here?

1:02:44.891 --> 1:02:46.025
Just a few questions.

1:02:46.059 --> 1:02:47.693
Not without his lawyer
present you're not.

1:02:47.726 --> 1:02:48.928
And that's you?

1:02:48.962 --> 1:02:50.529
Someone from my firm.

1:02:50.562 --> 1:02:51.898
What's this in reference to?

1:02:51.931 --> 1:02:52.999
Cassie Williams.

1:02:54.934 --> 1:02:57.235
That girl who disappeared?

1:02:57.269 --> 1:02:58.503
Yeah.

1:02:58.537 --> 1:03:01.807
Can you at least tell me where
he was the night before last?

1:03:01.841 --> 1:03:03.342
That's easy, he was with me.

1:03:04.443 --> 1:03:06.144
Anyone who could
corroborate that?

1:03:06.178 --> 1:03:07.512
Call the number on the card.

1:03:07.546 --> 1:03:08.380
Let's go.

1:03:12.986 --> 1:03:14.988
No, it wasn't a dog.

1:03:15.021 --> 1:03:17.522
You said the body was
wrapped in plastic.

1:03:17.556 --> 1:03:18.790
What color?

1:03:18.824 --> 1:03:21.493
Grayish, clearish,
like a shower liner.

1:03:22.361 --> 1:03:25.797
And you said that what, you
were about 75 feet away?

1:03:25.832 --> 1:03:27.799
Those headlights, that
was the only source

1:03:27.834 --> 1:03:28.800
of illumination?

1:03:28.835 --> 1:03:30.569
Why would anyone
bury a dog there?

1:03:30.602 --> 1:03:32.704
Sometimes people are
looking for a pretty place,

1:03:32.738 --> 1:03:34.806
sometimes they don't want
the body in the back yard.

1:03:34.841 --> 1:03:37.509
The rangers tell me pet
graves are not uncommon.

1:03:37.542 --> 1:03:39.344
Forensics is combing the site.

1:03:39.378 --> 1:03:41.713
That will take a day
or two but right now

1:03:41.747 --> 1:03:44.750
all we have tied to Cassie
is the car, nothing else.

1:03:44.783 --> 1:03:47.120
She's still
categorized as missing.

1:03:47.152 --> 1:03:49.821
We saw him, he was burying her.

1:03:49.856 --> 1:03:50.789
He killed her.

1:03:50.822 --> 1:03:52.824
You can't just let him
get away with that.

1:03:52.859 --> 1:03:54.760
Right now I'm
looking for evidence.

1:03:54.793 --> 1:03:56.896
I go where the
evidence takes me.

1:03:56.929 --> 1:03:59.264
Look, we'll keep an eye on him.

1:03:59.297 --> 1:04:00.732
I promise, okay?

1:04:06.906 --> 1:04:08.941
I just got this.

1:04:08.975 --> 1:04:12.177
Santini's ex girlfriend
filed a complaint

1:04:12.210 --> 1:04:14.379
against him last
year for assault.

1:04:14.413 --> 1:04:17.449
But his parents got a
lawyer, so they settled it.

1:04:17.482 --> 1:04:19.484
You see him doing it?

1:04:19.518 --> 1:04:20.786
Clay Howard?

1:04:23.588 --> 1:04:25.024
Maybe there's another option.

1:04:25.058 --> 1:04:25.958
Yeah, what?

1:04:25.992 --> 1:04:28.660
Well that steering
wheel was wiped clean

1:04:28.694 --> 1:04:29.661
and the footprints
were brushed over.

1:04:29.695 --> 1:04:31.898
It was really thorough
for a high school kid.

1:04:32.899 --> 1:04:36.768
That call that kid made,
what if it wasn't lost?

1:04:36.802 --> 1:04:39.839
What if it wasn't
logged in on purpose?

1:04:42.541 --> 1:04:43.375
Hmm.

1:04:45.777 --> 1:04:46.745
Like a cop?

1:04:47.679 --> 1:04:49.214
Well.

1:04:55.687 --> 1:04:57.355
What if we're wrong?

1:04:57.389 --> 1:04:58.858
I know what I saw.

1:04:58.891 --> 1:05:01.226
It be easier if we
didn't see it but we did.

1:05:01.259 --> 1:05:03.462
Then why did the
cops find a dog?

1:05:03.495 --> 1:05:06.199
Maybe Clay knew we
went to the police,

1:05:06.231 --> 1:05:07.799
so they moved the body
but they needed something

1:05:07.834 --> 1:05:10.002
to put in that hole to
explain what we saw.

1:05:10.837 --> 1:05:14.806
But how did they know
we went to the police?

1:05:14.841 --> 1:05:17.143
I mean, come on.

1:05:17.176 --> 1:05:18.510
What can we do?

1:05:20.312 --> 1:05:22.882
I'm told all the
time what I can't do,

1:05:22.915 --> 1:05:24.117
'cause I'm a kid,
'cause I'm a nerd.

1:05:24.150 --> 1:05:26.551
I'm told all kinds of reasons.

1:05:26.585 --> 1:05:28.754
She was always nice to me.

1:05:28.787 --> 1:05:30.522
Not 'cause she had to be.

1:05:30.555 --> 1:05:32.491
Everybody at that school liked
her just 'cause she wanted

1:05:32.524 --> 1:05:34.359
to be and she goes missing.

1:05:34.392 --> 1:05:36.294
We might have seen her go
into a hole in the ground

1:05:36.328 --> 1:05:37.763
and now everyone just
wants to wait around

1:05:37.796 --> 1:05:38.831
and see what happens?

1:05:39.765 --> 1:05:40.900
What can we do?

1:05:40.933 --> 1:05:42.501
We can chose to not look away.

1:05:42.534 --> 1:05:44.003
We can stand up
and do something,

1:05:44.036 --> 1:05:46.239
even if other people aren't.

1:05:46.271 --> 1:05:47.140
Just 'cause it's the hard thing

1:05:47.173 --> 1:05:48.841
doesn't mean it's
not the right thing.

1:05:50.742 --> 1:05:54.180
We can do what we can
and give this to anyone

1:05:54.213 --> 1:05:55.714
who tells us what we can't do.

1:06:00.186 --> 1:06:01.954
Unless the default
settings are turned off

1:06:01.988 --> 1:06:03.122
our phones should keep
everywhere we've been

1:06:03.156 --> 1:06:04.790
for the last month or so.

1:06:04.823 --> 1:06:06.225
Hidden file in the OS.

1:06:06.259 --> 1:06:07.692
Clay hasn't changed
the settings.

1:06:07.726 --> 1:06:08.995
It could have where he's been.

1:06:09.028 --> 1:06:10.830
And where he might
have put Cassie.

1:06:10.863 --> 1:06:12.364
Cop said she was
looking for evidence,

1:06:12.397 --> 1:06:13.365
let's get her some.

1:06:16.768 --> 1:06:18.770
Can't believe he's
just sitting there.

1:06:18.804 --> 1:06:20.840
He has, he has to look normal.

1:06:20.873 --> 1:06:22.741
You guys sure you
want to do this?

1:06:22.774 --> 1:06:24.476
What if there are consequences?

1:06:25.377 --> 1:06:27.146
Fuck the consequences.

1:06:28.446 --> 1:06:30.816
Good, I hate that guy.

1:06:42.094 --> 1:06:43.262
You got him?

1:06:47.432 --> 1:06:48.800
Also known as.

1:06:48.835 --> 1:06:53.272
Sitting Blue was a chief of
the Hunkpapa Lakota tribe

1:06:53.306 --> 1:06:54.406
part of the seven tribes
of the Sioux nation

1:06:55.607 --> 1:06:58.110
and the reason that we are
talking about him today

1:06:58.144 --> 1:07:03.149
because there was a treaty
in 1868

1:07:05.517 --> 1:07:06.751
and it was...

1:07:13.993 --> 1:07:15.995
Is wearing full war regalia,

1:07:16.028 --> 1:07:19.065
he's completely decked out,
even the horse is decked out

1:07:19.098 --> 1:07:20.032
and what...

1:07:20.933 --> 1:07:23.635
Put it away, final warning.

1:07:25.938 --> 1:07:29.075
Fighting amongst themselves
and with the US government.

1:07:32.377 --> 1:07:34.313
No, he's ignoring it.

1:07:37.250 --> 1:07:38.217
We'll go through listing

1:07:38.251 --> 1:07:39.919
all of the events
that lead up to.

1:07:39.952 --> 1:07:43.189
So, let me just take a look
at what you've got so far.

1:08:19.524 --> 1:08:20.927
Free period, he's grading.

1:08:21.894 --> 1:08:25.197
Serial WN 27843.

1:08:25.231 --> 1:08:28.267
Try pound nine zero zero six.

1:08:45.750 --> 1:08:47.386
Hey.

1:08:47.420 --> 1:08:49.554
I'm sorry about the
thing with Grant.

1:08:51.424 --> 1:08:52.624
It's okay.

1:08:52.657 --> 1:08:53.491
Is it?

1:08:56.695 --> 1:08:58.596
I mean, do you like him?

1:08:58.630 --> 1:09:02.201
I don't know, I mean
he can be a douche bag.

1:09:02.234 --> 1:09:03.601
That's for sure.

1:09:03.635 --> 1:09:05.938
But maybe I do?

1:09:06.805 --> 1:09:08.707
It's just, you
said what you said

1:09:08.740 --> 1:09:11.509
and I don't really
know what it meant.

1:09:11.543 --> 1:09:16.148
I guess it meant
you're my best friend.

1:09:17.083 --> 1:09:18.783
You're my best friend, too.

1:09:18.817 --> 1:09:23.022
And I don't want anything
to mess with that.

1:09:23.956 --> 1:09:24.789
Not possible.

1:09:41.841 --> 1:09:44.509
Mr. Dexter, please
come to the library.

1:09:44.542 --> 1:09:47.612
Mr. Dexter, come to
the library, please.

1:10:26.519 --> 1:10:27.319
You got it?

1:10:27.353 --> 1:10:28.320
No, I can't find it.

1:10:28.354 --> 1:10:29.188
It's not in his desk.
It's gotta be in there.

1:10:29.221 --> 1:10:30.122
Just keep looking.

1:10:35.261 --> 1:10:36.262
Shit.

1:10:36.295 --> 1:10:37.096
What?

1:10:37.129 --> 1:10:37.930
He's coming back.

1:10:37.963 --> 1:10:38.831
Already?

1:10:38.864 --> 1:10:40.533
Just stay, I'll buy
you a few minutes.

1:10:40.565 --> 1:10:42.034
Just find it.

1:10:42.068 --> 1:10:43.635
Wait, what are you doing?

1:10:43.668 --> 1:10:45.104
What's happening?

1:10:45.137 --> 1:10:46.604
Consequences.

1:10:55.081 --> 1:10:56.982
Holly, what the
hell are you doing?

1:10:57.016 --> 1:10:58.150
This is bullshit.

1:10:58.184 --> 1:10:59.885
This school isn't
gonna change my life,

1:10:59.919 --> 1:11:01.420
you make it worse.

1:11:02.388 --> 1:11:04.656
I hate this school!

1:11:04.689 --> 1:11:05.958
Just calm down.

1:11:09.261 --> 1:11:10.830
Holly, calm down.

1:11:10.863 --> 1:11:12.932
Calm down, stop
tearing these down.

1:11:12.965 --> 1:11:15.167
Holly, just stop.
Screw you.

1:11:15.201 --> 1:11:16.368
Give me those.

1:11:16.402 --> 1:11:18.636
They beat up my friend and
now they do nothing about it.

1:11:18.670 --> 1:11:20.139
No, Holly...
Screw this school.

1:11:20.172 --> 1:11:22.707
Holly, stop it, calm down.

1:11:22.740 --> 1:11:23.708
Holly!

1:11:28.180 --> 1:11:29.181
Stop it.

1:11:29.215 --> 1:11:30.216
No way.

1:11:30.249 --> 1:11:31.016
Give those to me.

1:11:31.050 --> 1:11:31.851
They're mine.

1:11:31.884 --> 1:11:32.985
I think you better
call security.

1:11:33.018 --> 1:11:34.453
Screw you, too.

1:11:35.387 --> 1:11:36.555
Security!

1:11:42.561 --> 1:11:43.362
No, no!

1:11:43.395 --> 1:11:45.297
Calm down, just calm down.

1:11:51.736 --> 1:11:52.571
What's going on?

1:11:53.973 --> 1:11:55.841
What is going on?

1:12:14.560 --> 1:12:16.395
One of those days.

1:12:57.102 --> 1:12:57.937
Hey, dude!

1:13:02.107 --> 1:13:03.409
What the hell?

1:13:03.442 --> 1:13:04.243
You stole your parents car?

1:13:04.276 --> 1:13:05.077
It's better than a bike.

1:13:05.110 --> 1:13:05.945
You get it?

1:13:21.060 --> 1:13:26.065
Hey, so about that
thing with me and Holly.

1:13:26.365 --> 1:13:28.534
It's fine, we talked about it.

1:13:28.567 --> 1:13:29.401
Yeah?

1:13:31.337 --> 1:13:32.171
Oh.

1:13:34.940 --> 1:13:36.075
Well, I just wanted
you to know that it's...

1:13:36.108 --> 1:13:37.876
Now is not the time.

1:13:37.910 --> 1:13:38.743
Sure.

1:13:42.715 --> 1:13:45.750
Is it fine like
actually fine or is it...

1:13:47.953 --> 1:13:49.521
It's encrypted.

1:13:49.555 --> 1:13:50.689
Well can you cracked it?

1:13:50.723 --> 1:13:52.491
Well I had hoped
he had an older OS

1:13:52.524 --> 1:13:53.559
or hadn't set it up

1:13:53.592 --> 1:13:57.663
but it's the latest
version and it's encrypted.

1:13:59.265 --> 1:14:01.166
I just thought if
we did something it,

1:14:02.001 --> 1:14:05.204
if only we could talk to
her, just for a minute,

1:14:05.237 --> 1:14:07.339
she could tell us what happened.

1:14:11.443 --> 1:14:13.912
I trusted him and
then I found out

1:14:13.946 --> 1:14:15.147
that I shouldn't have.

1:14:15.180 --> 1:14:17.116
Found things the he
was hiding from me.

1:14:18.783 --> 1:14:19.718
Maybe we can.

1:14:30.162 --> 1:14:30.996
Dude?

1:14:32.898 --> 1:14:35.200
She found things.

1:14:35.234 --> 1:14:36.635
She found things.

1:14:37.536 --> 1:14:40.272
I know I'd seen
that name before.

1:14:56.622 --> 1:14:58.490
What happened to you?

1:14:58.524 --> 1:15:01.527
Suspended, people with
perfect records are boring.

1:15:01.560 --> 1:15:03.262
Did you find anything?

1:15:03.295 --> 1:15:05.197
GPS log gets lost in the woods

1:15:05.230 --> 1:15:06.665
but he went back into that park,

1:15:06.699 --> 1:15:08.367
close to where we
saw him that night

1:15:08.400 --> 1:15:10.736
and left out the same
entrance an hour later

1:15:10.769 --> 1:15:12.504
and then he was there right

1:15:12.538 --> 1:15:14.239
before we were
there with the cops.

1:15:14.273 --> 1:15:15.140
Holy shit.

1:15:15.174 --> 1:15:16.575
That's not the best part.

1:15:16.608 --> 1:15:17.409
What's the best part?

1:15:17.443 --> 1:15:18.744
I saw him earlier this morning

1:15:18.777 --> 1:15:20.212
on the other side of the park.

1:15:20.245 --> 1:15:22.781
Wait, isn't now when
we call the cops?

1:15:22.815 --> 1:15:24.683
Clay moved the body, remember?

1:15:24.717 --> 1:15:25.984
The only people we
told were the cops.

1:15:26.018 --> 1:15:27.853
What if one of them
tipped him off,

1:15:27.886 --> 1:15:28.921
what if that's how he knew

1:15:28.954 --> 1:15:30.356
and what if they
tip him off again?

1:15:30.389 --> 1:15:33.092
We need hard proof,
we need to find her.

1:15:33.125 --> 1:15:34.793
What if Clay shows up?

1:15:34.828 --> 1:15:36.628
Don't make me give
you the finger.

1:15:37.529 --> 1:15:39.031
You're going no matter what?

1:15:45.537 --> 1:15:47.673
What does he mean the finger?

1:15:47.706 --> 1:15:49.274
I need to stop by my house.

1:15:52.644 --> 1:15:54.012
My dad's rifle's locked up.

1:16:03.122 --> 1:16:04.022
You are amazing.

1:16:06.425 --> 1:16:08.227
Why'd you bring a Porsche?

1:16:08.260 --> 1:16:09.895
My dad took the Beemer to work.

1:16:11.997 --> 1:16:13.265
What?

1:16:13.298 --> 1:16:16.168
Just don't get us pulled over.

1:16:16.201 --> 1:16:17.035
Hey.

1:16:19.171 --> 1:16:20.139
You were right.

1:16:21.507 --> 1:16:25.177
I can be selfish
sometimes but I'm here.

1:16:26.311 --> 1:16:27.346
Okay.

1:16:55.040 --> 1:16:55.875
Mr. Howard.

1:16:56.942 --> 1:16:57.776
Almost forgot.

1:17:23.635 --> 1:17:25.905
I dropped a pin to
mark where he was.

1:17:25.939 --> 1:17:27.473
Should be somewhere over there.

1:17:47.192 --> 1:17:48.093
Over there.

1:19:36.668 --> 1:19:37.669
Hey, Cassie.

1:20:02.160 --> 1:20:02.996
Shit.

1:20:05.697 --> 1:20:06.565
Marcus!

1:20:45.270 --> 1:20:46.105
Marcus!

1:20:47.874 --> 1:20:48.774
Give me the phone.

1:20:51.176 --> 1:20:52.011
Toss it.

1:20:53.046 --> 1:20:53.946
Toss it right now!

1:20:56.949 --> 1:20:58.684
Give me the phone.

1:21:02.688 --> 1:21:04.322
Don't move.

1:21:04.356 --> 1:21:05.958
Don't fucking move.

1:21:15.968 --> 1:21:17.369
Who was that to?

1:21:18.503 --> 1:21:19.805
Huh?

1:21:19.839 --> 1:21:21.941
Who, who was it to?

1:21:28.848 --> 1:21:29.681
Shit.

1:21:33.685 --> 1:21:35.088
Who else are you here with?

1:21:35.121 --> 1:21:35.922
It's just me.

1:21:35.955 --> 1:21:37.857
Bullshit, you drove the Porsche?

1:21:37.890 --> 1:21:39.257
I hacked your phone.

1:21:39.291 --> 1:21:41.226
Tells the cops everything
they need to know,

1:21:41.259 --> 1:21:43.096
whether or not I say anything.

1:21:43.129 --> 1:21:44.696
You have it?

1:21:44.730 --> 1:21:46.698
It's already on its way to them.

1:21:46.732 --> 1:21:49.068
I can still tell
when you're lying.

1:21:49.102 --> 1:21:50.268
It was you, right?

1:21:50.302 --> 1:21:52.370
It was you the other
night in the woods?

1:21:56.274 --> 1:21:59.444
Yeah, I really wish
you hadn't seen me.

1:22:07.220 --> 1:22:08.520
Just gonna kill me, too?

1:22:14.593 --> 1:22:18.663
I didn't kill her.

1:22:18.697 --> 1:22:19.698
I loved her.

1:22:31.710 --> 1:22:33.378
I didn't kill her, man.

1:22:33.411 --> 1:22:34.646
I saw you burying her.

1:22:35.580 --> 1:22:38.450
I could never hurt her.

1:22:38.483 --> 1:22:42.221
She was the most
important thing to me.

1:22:47.692 --> 1:22:49.594
She'd been dating
Bryan for forever but,

1:22:53.132 --> 1:22:57.069
I mean I never felt
something like that before.

1:22:59.771 --> 1:23:02.674
I think she had a sense of
what I was into but I...

1:23:02.707 --> 1:23:04.342
Clay, Will.

1:23:04.376 --> 1:23:05.278
Will, Clay.

1:23:06.778 --> 1:23:08.647
I don't think she knew how deep.

1:23:11.284 --> 1:23:13.552
Or what the people
I was involved with

1:23:13.585 --> 1:23:14.921
were capable of.

1:23:17.924 --> 1:23:19.391
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1:23:24.696 --> 1:23:26.299
The other day she
broke into my phone,

1:23:26.331 --> 1:23:28.034
saw what I was doing.

1:23:28.067 --> 1:23:29.534
Saw that I thought Will's people

1:23:29.568 --> 1:23:31.736
were behind the
murder going done.

1:23:31.770 --> 1:23:34.506
Said she couldn't be
with someone like that.

1:23:34.539 --> 1:23:35.807
I told her I was just
in it for the money,

1:23:35.842 --> 1:23:38.443
that I, that I could take
care of her if she wanted.

1:23:39.377 --> 1:23:42.248
She said she didn't love me.

1:23:43.415 --> 1:23:46.319
Never loved me,
said it was over.

1:23:46.351 --> 1:23:47.253
I told her I'd give it up,

1:23:47.286 --> 1:23:49.554
I'd go to college.

1:23:49.588 --> 1:23:52.158
Whatever she wanted, I'd do it.

1:23:52.191 --> 1:23:53.491
Do you even care about me?

1:23:53.525 --> 1:23:54.927
I begged her.

1:23:54.961 --> 1:23:57.997
She told me stay away and
that if I came any closer

1:23:58.030 --> 1:24:00.665
she'd call the cops and
tell them what I was doing.

1:24:00.699 --> 1:24:01.868
Cassie, I can keep you safe!

1:24:01.901 --> 1:24:03.435
Cassie, I love you.

1:24:03.468 --> 1:24:04.536
Let go of me.
I love you.

1:24:04.569 --> 1:24:05.370
Let go of me.

1:24:05.403 --> 1:24:06.538
Let fucking go of me.

1:24:13.712 --> 1:24:18.050
I never saw her again.

1:24:18.084 --> 1:24:19.986
What happened to her?

1:24:21.453 --> 1:24:24.290
She started telling people
what she saw in my phone

1:24:24.323 --> 1:24:26.725
and that she had
to go to the cops.

1:24:26.758 --> 1:24:29.262
Tell them that she knew
who was behind the murders.

1:24:30.562 --> 1:24:32.298
It must have gotten back
to Will that she knew

1:24:33.398 --> 1:24:34.267
and that she was gonna talk.

1:24:35.167 --> 1:24:37.402
Shut the fuck up!

1:24:49.348 --> 1:24:51.150
Told you he wasn't ready.

1:24:52.684 --> 1:24:54.452
They told me to bury her.

1:24:54.486 --> 1:24:55.955
Told me to clean up my mess

1:24:56.821 --> 1:24:58.823
and he made it clear what
would happen if I didn't,

1:24:58.858 --> 1:25:01.760
to me, to Robbie, to my crew.

1:25:03.963 --> 1:25:08.267
Oh shit, oh shit Marcus I
told them I was coming here.

1:25:08.301 --> 1:25:10.735
Marcus, you need to go.

1:25:10.769 --> 1:25:11.603
Yo, Clay where you at?

1:25:13.772 --> 1:25:14.739
Shit.

1:25:14.773 --> 1:25:15.707
Marcus, go.

1:25:16.641 --> 1:25:17.475
Marcus, my phone.

1:25:21.147 --> 1:25:22.214
Marcus.

1:25:34.961 --> 1:25:37.629
Yeah man, she's right over here.

1:25:52.111 --> 1:25:54.046
Will aint too happy.

1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:58.050
Too many people talking,
now that 5-0's on it.

1:25:58.084 --> 1:26:00.052
Hell, when you kill
someone people notice.

1:26:00.086 --> 1:26:01.420
Not when you do it right.

1:26:02.821 --> 1:26:04.190
Why y'all dig her up.

1:26:05.291 --> 1:26:06.092
We're gonna move her again.

1:26:06.125 --> 1:26:07.692
Again?

1:26:07.726 --> 1:26:08.760
Why?

1:26:08.793 --> 1:26:10.997
We thought somebody maybe
saw us leaving the park.

1:26:12.431 --> 1:26:13.531
Damn, boy.

1:26:13.565 --> 1:26:15.267
You fucked this up right.

1:26:15.301 --> 1:26:17.535
Who's Porsche is that?

1:26:17.569 --> 1:26:18.737
It's Robbie's.

1:26:18.770 --> 1:26:19.604
Oh.

1:26:20.473 --> 1:26:21.374
That's your car?

1:26:25.777 --> 1:26:28.780
Well, you aint say nothing
about having to move

1:26:28.813 --> 1:26:31.484
when you called, said
your phone was gone.

1:26:31.516 --> 1:26:32.751
That some shit on
there might be trouble.

1:26:32.784 --> 1:26:33.685
Yeah, false alarm.

1:26:33.718 --> 1:26:35.054
You got it, let me see it.

1:26:36.455 --> 1:26:38.024
Hey, I see you.

1:26:38.057 --> 1:26:39.691
Hey, hey, hey.

1:26:40.792 --> 1:26:41.593
We don't want any trouble, man.

1:26:41.626 --> 1:26:43.628
Aight, just go.

1:26:43.661 --> 1:26:44.497
We got it under control.

1:26:44.529 --> 1:26:45.331
Who's over there?

1:26:45.364 --> 1:26:46.298
No one.

1:26:46.332 --> 1:26:48.566
He's just a kid, he
didn't see anything.

1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:49.435
He's not gonna be a problem.

1:26:49.468 --> 1:26:50.635
Well step on out, kid.

1:26:50.668 --> 1:26:53.873
No, no, no don't move,
don't move, don't move.

1:26:53.906 --> 1:26:54.706
The kid walks.

1:27:02.214 --> 1:27:03.049
Holy shit.

1:27:04.216 --> 1:27:05.017
Fuck!

1:27:05.051 --> 1:27:05.851
Oh shit.

1:27:15.061 --> 1:27:15.895
No!

1:27:20.665 --> 1:27:21.766
Head back towards the car.

1:27:21.800 --> 1:27:23.002
If you get a signal,
you call 911.

1:27:23.035 --> 1:27:24.370
If you get to the
car, get out of here.

1:27:24.403 --> 1:27:25.271
What about you?

1:27:32.044 --> 1:27:33.412
It aint that bad.

1:27:33.446 --> 1:27:35.214
Go, get after whosever
in them woods.

1:27:35.247 --> 1:27:36.415
I'll take care of these two.

1:27:44.256 --> 1:27:45.858
Marcus, please you
have to come with us.

1:27:45.891 --> 1:27:46.691
Just get the cops here.

1:27:46.724 --> 1:27:47.625
I'll lead them away if I can.

1:27:47.659 --> 1:27:49.895
They could kill you.

1:27:49.929 --> 1:27:50.896
Go, go.

1:27:50.930 --> 1:27:51.897
No, wait.

1:27:51.931 --> 1:27:52.730
Come on.
Shit.

1:28:40.379 --> 1:28:42.314
Who the hell are you?

1:28:58.730 --> 1:28:59.532
I gotta go back.

1:28:59.565 --> 1:29:00.765
We need to make that call

1:29:00.798 --> 1:29:02.535
and we need to the cops here
no matter what just happened.

1:29:02.568 --> 1:29:03.435
Then go do it.

1:29:04.837 --> 1:29:05.703
Be careful.

1:29:05.737 --> 1:29:06.572
Once I have help on the way

1:29:06.605 --> 1:29:08.274
I am coming back for you.

1:29:08.307 --> 1:29:09.141
Okay?

1:29:10.843 --> 1:29:11.676
Okay.

1:29:13.145 --> 1:29:14.313
I'm gonna ask you one more time,

1:29:14.346 --> 1:29:16.282
who are you, who you here with?

1:29:22.988 --> 1:29:23.821
Mom.

1:29:27.927 --> 1:29:28.894
Hey, hey.

1:29:28.928 --> 1:29:29.995
You want us to get out of here?

1:29:30.029 --> 1:29:30.896
We'll get of here.

1:29:30.930 --> 1:29:32.164
We didn't see anything.

1:29:33.065 --> 1:29:36.135
Hey, look at me, look at me.

1:29:36.168 --> 1:29:37.636
I'm a nurse.

1:29:37.670 --> 1:29:39.238
I can take care of
your leg for you

1:29:39.271 --> 1:29:41.540
then you'll never from us again.

1:29:41.574 --> 1:29:43.142
Is that what you want, huh?

1:29:43.175 --> 1:29:44.476
What do you want, tell me.

1:29:47.546 --> 1:29:48.447
You're his moms.

1:29:50.182 --> 1:29:52.151
Aint nobody else coming.

1:29:52.184 --> 1:29:53.686
Hey!

1:29:53.718 --> 1:29:54.553
You want this?

1:29:57.022 --> 1:29:58.657
Marcus go, go.

1:30:18.177 --> 1:30:19.011
Damn it.

1:30:27.086 --> 1:30:27.920
Oh shit.

1:30:45.371 --> 1:30:46.905
Yes.

1:30:53.212 --> 1:30:54.113
Ms. Alex?

1:31:01.687 --> 1:31:02.521
Fuck.

1:31:16.835 --> 1:31:17.903
Okay, okay.

1:31:17.936 --> 1:31:19.505
Marcus, Marcus is back that way.

1:31:19.538 --> 1:31:20.939
I know, we have to go.

1:31:25.611 --> 1:31:26.578
Yo!

1:31:26.612 --> 1:31:27.446
Shit.

1:31:34.153 --> 1:31:34.953
Oh my god.

1:31:34.987 --> 1:31:36.422
Go, go.

1:32:06.952 --> 1:32:08.454
Oh.

1:32:08.487 --> 1:32:10.756
Let's go, come on, come on.

1:32:13.025 --> 1:32:13.827
Keep pressure on this.

1:32:13.859 --> 1:32:15.694
Listen, they're after my boy.

1:32:15.728 --> 1:32:16.695
How many?

1:32:16.729 --> 1:32:17.963
Two, I think they
killed that girl.

1:32:17.996 --> 1:32:18.797
The body's over there.

1:32:18.832 --> 1:32:20.499
Responding at the scene.

1:32:20.532 --> 1:32:22.901
Two armed suspects, shots fired.

1:32:22.935 --> 1:32:25.971
Two vics, I'm gonna
need an Ambo for one.

1:32:26.004 --> 1:32:27.841
Copy that, 118,
officers en route.

1:32:27.873 --> 1:32:31.176
Listen to me, keep
talking to the dispatch.

1:32:31.210 --> 1:32:32.478
It's gonna be okay, okay?

1:32:33.512 --> 1:32:34.513
My boy.

1:32:34.546 --> 1:32:36.014
I'll find him.

1:32:59.271 --> 1:33:01.340
You shoot me, this
bag floats down river

1:33:01.373 --> 1:33:03.142
then whoever finds
it has that phone.

1:33:03.175 --> 1:33:04.943
You gonna get hurt, little man.

1:33:04.977 --> 1:33:07.079
Just give me the phone
and I'll let you go.

1:33:12.684 --> 1:33:13.853
Fuck.

1:33:13.887 --> 1:33:15.320
Shit.

1:33:20.793 --> 1:33:21.627
Fuck.

1:33:22.628 --> 1:33:24.696
Police, drop your weapon.

1:33:27.599 --> 1:33:28.767
Alright, then.

1:33:40.279 --> 1:33:41.079
Yo!

1:33:41.113 --> 1:33:42.781
Aint you that cop, Steve?

1:33:42.815 --> 1:33:44.183
Yeah.

1:33:44.216 --> 1:33:46.518
Shit, what you doing, man?

1:33:47.486 --> 1:33:50.355
What I should have
done for Darnell.

1:33:50.389 --> 1:33:52.191
Jesus, I didn't think
it hurt this much.

1:33:52.224 --> 1:33:53.927
Ambulance is on it's way.

1:33:58.730 --> 1:33:59.698
I got the police.

1:33:59.731 --> 1:34:00.666
Yeah, we know.

1:34:00.699 --> 1:34:02.634
We gotta find Marcus.

1:34:08.273 --> 1:34:09.274
Come here.

1:34:17.951 --> 1:34:18.750
Fuck.

1:34:20.319 --> 1:34:21.286
Oh shit.

1:35:10.369 --> 1:35:13.006
You there when she died?

1:35:18.310 --> 1:35:19.879
Shit.

1:35:19.913 --> 1:35:22.080
Give me the fucking bag.

1:35:34.493 --> 1:35:35.327
Let go!

1:35:36.595 --> 1:35:37.931
Marcus!

1:35:48.875 --> 1:35:49.708
Marcus!

1:36:03.957 --> 1:36:04.790
Marcus.

1:36:08.093 --> 1:36:08.928
Marcus!

1:36:17.336 --> 1:36:18.170
Marcus!

1:36:29.615 --> 1:36:30.449
Marcus!

1:36:31.516 --> 1:36:33.485
It's okay, it's okay.

1:36:51.938 --> 1:36:52.872
Get down!

1:36:54.239 --> 1:36:55.140
Drop the bag.

1:36:56.308 --> 1:36:57.342
Get down.

1:36:57.376 --> 1:36:58.644
I said get down.

1:37:01.813 --> 1:37:03.049
Ma'am, keep your mask on.

1:37:03.082 --> 1:37:03.883
Get him...
I need you

1:37:03.916 --> 1:37:05.450
to keep your eyes open and keep,

1:37:05.484 --> 1:37:06.818
stay with us.

1:37:11.823 --> 1:37:13.291
Hey, we're gonna find him.

1:37:19.966 --> 1:37:23.168
Want me to go?

1:37:23.201 --> 1:37:24.037
Holly!

1:37:30.143 --> 1:37:31.844
I'm gonna take you
home now, okay?

1:37:39.685 --> 1:37:41.286
No.

1:37:59.872 --> 1:38:00.706
Clay.

1:38:31.871 --> 1:38:33.206
Hey, you okay?

1:39:08.373 --> 1:39:10.642
Today was a hard one.

1:39:10.675 --> 1:39:12.245
You were good police, today.

1:39:12.277 --> 1:39:14.113
B-team is coming to take over.

1:39:14.147 --> 1:39:15.814
Get what rest you can.

1:39:15.848 --> 1:39:17.749
Back 1000 hours,
thank you, goodnight.

1:39:18.683 --> 1:39:20.685
Thank you.
Goodnight.

1:39:34.100 --> 1:39:35.667
I told you to go home.

1:39:35.700 --> 1:39:37.170
Yeah, well if he's
really badly hurt

1:39:37.203 --> 1:39:38.436
he doesn't have a lot of time.

1:39:38.470 --> 1:39:39.872
You really want
to help this kid.

1:39:39.906 --> 1:39:41.040
Well, some of us
signed up for this job

1:39:41.073 --> 1:39:42.008
for more than the
pension, right?

1:39:42.041 --> 1:39:42.975
I didn't sign up
for the pension.

1:39:43.009 --> 1:39:44.309
I talked to Matt Schwartz.

1:39:51.050 --> 1:39:51.951
Yeah.

1:39:51.984 --> 1:39:53.853
He said that he was
on phones the night

1:39:53.886 --> 1:39:55.254
the kid called in.

1:39:55.288 --> 1:39:56.856
He said you took over for him

1:39:56.889 --> 1:39:58.390
when we went to go
pick up his lo mein.

1:39:58.423 --> 1:40:02.829
It's not much but if I keep
digging I'm gonna find more,

1:40:02.862 --> 1:40:03.695
won't I?

1:40:06.398 --> 1:40:07.699
You know why you
didn't make lieutenant

1:40:07.732 --> 1:40:08.533
three years ago?

1:40:08.567 --> 1:40:09.401
I don't know, why do you think

1:40:09.434 --> 1:40:10.837
I didn't make lieutenant
three years ago?

1:40:10.870 --> 1:40:13.338
It's not 'cause I told the
bosses you hit that kid,

1:40:13.371 --> 1:40:15.007
it's because you
put a 15 year old

1:40:15.041 --> 1:40:17.009
in the hospital for
mouthing off to you.

1:40:17.043 --> 1:40:18.476
He's deaf in his left ear.

1:40:18.510 --> 1:40:20.378
His jaw will never be the same

1:40:20.412 --> 1:40:21.881
and that aint being good police,

1:40:21.914 --> 1:40:24.283
at least it shouldn't be.

1:40:24.317 --> 1:40:26.219
Some lines, when you cross them,

1:40:26.252 --> 1:40:27.819
it's gotta count
for some things.

1:40:27.854 --> 1:40:30.323
So, yeah.

1:40:30.355 --> 1:40:32.191
I filed that report.

1:40:33.092 --> 1:40:34.293
You're damn right I did.

1:40:36.128 --> 1:40:38.563
But today, you saved that woman,

1:40:39.464 --> 1:40:42.801
Steve, and those kids, and
even Howard is hanging on

1:40:42.835 --> 1:40:47.840
in the ICU, so this thing,
whatever you're into, it's over.

1:40:55.147 --> 1:40:55.982
It's over.

1:40:57.216 --> 1:40:59.784
You were good
police today, Steve.

1:40:59.818 --> 1:41:01.921
I hope wherever you end up

1:41:01.954 --> 1:41:04.357
you're the cop
that you are today.

1:41:04.389 --> 1:41:06.058
But it can't be in my precinct.

1:41:07.492 --> 1:41:08.327
You understand?

1:41:12.530 --> 1:41:13.366
Yeah.

1:41:14.766 --> 1:41:15.700
Go home, Steve.

1:41:32.550 --> 1:41:33.685
They're still looking.

1:41:33.718 --> 1:41:35.553
But nothing yet.

1:41:35.587 --> 1:41:37.390
It's two in the morning.

1:41:37.422 --> 1:41:38.958
They had to do surgery.

1:41:38.991 --> 1:41:40.893
You lost a lot of blood.

1:41:40.927 --> 1:41:42.261
You need to rest.

1:41:43.162 --> 1:41:44.931
For now, at least.

1:41:44.964 --> 1:41:49.035
The number of times I've
said that to patients.

1:41:50.303 --> 1:41:54.941
And I'm always surprised when
they don't want to listen.

1:41:57.376 --> 1:41:59.879
I tried to get Marcus to listen.

1:42:00.947 --> 1:42:02.781
I tried to make him come with us

1:42:04.016 --> 1:42:06.651
but he's so stubborn.

1:42:11.057 --> 1:42:12.124
I'm mad at him.

1:42:15.094 --> 1:42:15.928
Is that bad?

1:42:16.996 --> 1:42:18.130
Are you mad at him?

1:42:22.034 --> 1:42:22.868
You...

1:42:28.274 --> 1:42:31.676
Won't have kids for
awhile but if you do,

1:42:32.811 --> 1:42:37.049
from day one, you feed them
like you're feeding yourself.

1:42:44.756 --> 1:42:48.394
You worry about their
future like it's your own.

1:42:52.965 --> 1:42:57.203
Feel the pain when they hurt.

1:43:00.106 --> 1:43:01.107
When they're scared.

1:43:03.808 --> 1:43:05.577
You get used to
taking care of them

1:43:05.610 --> 1:43:07.880
like they're a part of you.

1:43:11.050 --> 1:43:12.952
But they're not really.

1:43:16.422 --> 1:43:19.091
At some point, they
prove it to you.

1:43:19.125 --> 1:43:22.194
They just become
their own thing.

1:43:27.500 --> 1:43:30.469
A part of me is mad, yeah,

1:43:32.138 --> 1:43:34.739
that he didn't think
how it would hurt me

1:43:34.773 --> 1:43:36.175
if anything happened to him.

1:43:41.047 --> 1:43:43.082
But he's not really
my boy anymore.

1:43:47.219 --> 1:43:48.220
It happened.

1:43:49.687 --> 1:43:54.326
He made his decisions and
those decisions saved my life

1:43:54.360 --> 1:43:57.129
and maybe yours.

1:44:00.466 --> 1:44:02.268
They brought justice
for that girl.

1:44:09.408 --> 1:44:11.877
I wish he hadn't
done any of it but I,

1:44:14.246 --> 1:44:15.081
I'm proud.

1:44:18.851 --> 1:44:20.453
I am so damn proud.

1:44:25.391 --> 1:44:26.724
He did more in one day

1:44:26.758 --> 1:44:29.594
than most people
do in a lifetime.

1:44:34.333 --> 1:44:36.469
He was so brave.

1:44:36.502 --> 1:44:37.903
Marcus, Marcus!

1:44:40.172 --> 1:44:43.075
How can I be mad
at him for that?

1:44:47.279 --> 1:44:49.281
Hey, hey Marcus.

1:44:49.315 --> 1:44:50.682
Hey, you there buddy?

1:44:50.715 --> 1:44:52.617
Okay, okay.

1:44:52.650 --> 1:44:53.486
Yeah, yeah, it's all right.

1:44:53.519 --> 1:44:54.386
Let's get you up.

1:44:57.923 --> 1:44:59.158
You'll be fine.

1:45:00.159 --> 1:45:02.294
Come on, here, put this on.

1:45:02.328 --> 1:45:03.429
Hey, Captain!

1:45:04.964 --> 1:45:06.565
Captain!

1:45:17.076 --> 1:45:18.377
There's one.

1:45:18.410 --> 1:45:20.778
They look like fireworks.

1:45:20.812 --> 1:45:23.282
Shooting stars totally
beat a blood moon.

1:45:28.753 --> 1:45:30.189
I don't know.

1:45:30.222 --> 1:45:32.391
Blood moons are super
rare, so kind of cooler

1:45:32.424 --> 1:45:35.394
plus the whole end
of the world thing.

1:45:35.427 --> 1:45:37.229
Blood moon doesn't mean
there's an apocalypse.

1:45:37.263 --> 1:45:38.631
So you say.

1:45:43.569 --> 1:45:45.437
Remember the last
time we did this?

1:45:48.174 --> 1:45:52.111
She's gone but the world
just keeps on turning.

1:45:53.546 --> 1:45:55.447
How is that right?

1:45:55.481 --> 1:45:57.749
It aint right it just is.

1:45:58.984 --> 1:45:59.952
So cold.

1:46:01.020 --> 1:46:03.389
It's like she died and
it doesn't even matter.

1:46:05.591 --> 1:46:09.461
It does matter, to us.

1:46:09.495 --> 1:46:12.131
Maybe the universe is cold
and maybe it doesn't care,

1:46:13.065 --> 1:46:14.600
it doesn't meant that we can't.

1:46:17.102 --> 1:46:19.338
I haven't forgotten
her and I won't.
