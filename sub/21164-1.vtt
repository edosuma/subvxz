"And the spirits
of the giants afflict,

01:04.498 --> 01:08.333
oppress, destroy,
attack, do battle.

01:08.335 --> 01:10.803
Attack, do battle.

01:10.805 --> 01:12.538
And work destruction

01:12.540 --> 01:14.473
on the earth
and cause trouble.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.708
On the earth
and cause trouble.

01:18.511 --> 01:19.678
They take no food,

01:19.680 --> 01:22.314
but nevertheless
hunger and thirst,

01:22.316 --> 01:23.782
and cause offenses.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.451
Cause offenses.

01:30.190 --> 01:31.790
And now the giants,
who were produced

01:31.792 --> 01:33.292
from the spirits and flesh--

01:33.294 --> 01:35.360
produced from
the spirits and flesh...

01:37.797 --> 01:40.566
Shall be called evil spirits
upon the earth.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.267
Evil spirits upon the earth."

01:42.269 --> 01:43.702
The book of Enoch.

02:02.655 --> 02:03.856
Hi, I'm Jessica lake.

02:03.858 --> 02:05.858
I'm here to see
Haley Fletcher.

02:10.530 --> 02:11.597
Follow me.

02:21.841 --> 02:24.143
Don't think
you're gonna have much luck.

02:31.519 --> 02:34.153
Haley?

02:36.489 --> 02:37.756
I'm Jessica lake.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.859
Um, I wanted to ask you
a few questions.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.498
Haley.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.704
I know this
is really hard,

02:52.706 --> 02:56.708
but I need you to answer
some questions for me, okay?

03:00.780 --> 03:03.615
You're gonna die.
You'll die.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.917
Can you see?

03:07.620 --> 03:09.321
Can you see?

03:09.323 --> 03:11.823
It's him. He's near.

03:11.825 --> 03:14.893
He's here.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.329
I don't know!
I don't know!

03:17.331 --> 03:20.199
I don't know.
Didn't tell me.

03:20.201 --> 03:21.900
Didn't tell me.
He didn't tell me.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.936
He didn't tell me.
He didn't tell me.

03:23.938 --> 03:26.638
He didn't tell me.
He didn't tell me!

03:26.640 --> 03:29.975
He didn't tell me.
He didn't tell me.

03:33.913 --> 03:36.481
Can't you? Can't you?

03:40.486 --> 03:41.920
Can't you?

03:46.693 --> 03:48.927
You shouldn't be coming here.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.571
You're going to die.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.439
They all die.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.575
There's just no way.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.343
There's no escape.
There's--

05:52.952 --> 05:55.454
Jessica? Oh.

05:56.856 --> 05:59.124
What are you up to?

05:59.126 --> 06:02.728
I was in the bath.
It's been one of those days.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.731
Please don't let me interrupt.
I don't mind.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.600
Did you get my invoice?

06:08.602 --> 06:11.403
Yes, we did, and great job
on that asylum piece.

06:11.405 --> 06:14.840
Why aren't you
taking your bath?

06:14.842 --> 06:16.108
So what is it, Damian?

06:16.110 --> 06:18.477
I have another
assignment for you.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.145
Here's the contact
information.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.715
It's another found footage
of some sort.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.518
He only wants
to talk with you.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.821
-He sounds urgent.
-Like a stalker fan
or something?

06:29.823 --> 06:33.558
I don't think so.
Could be a good story.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.595
-He's expecting you.
-All right, is that it?

06:36.597 --> 06:39.598
Do you want some company?
I mean, I could stay connected

06:39.600 --> 06:42.067
if you...

06:42.069 --> 06:44.803
That's creepy, Damian. Bye.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.953
Justin?

08:47.593 --> 08:50.228
Excuse me, are you Justin?

08:50.230 --> 08:51.897
Thanks for coming.

08:51.899 --> 08:54.065
My producer tells me that you
want to talk to me

08:54.067 --> 08:56.868
about your paranormal
investigation, is that right?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.270
Yeah.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.681
So?

09:09.683 --> 09:11.883
This is not a normal
investigation.

09:14.887 --> 09:17.622
Something happened to every one
of the hunters that night.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.867
Nobody's life
is the same now.

09:31.037 --> 09:32.604
We're all sick.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.242
The darkness.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.910
Mold or something
at the site?

09:38.912 --> 09:42.280
Nothing like that.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.683
Whatever we ran into,

09:44.685 --> 09:46.885
whatever we came
in contact with

09:46.887 --> 09:48.720
was not a ghost.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.328
Demonic?

09:56.330 --> 09:59.230
Aaron thought
it was a scaler.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.666
A scaler?
I'm not-- I'm not
familiar with that.

10:01.668 --> 10:04.636
-What is?
-He called him that.

10:04.638 --> 10:08.173
Aaron was an antiquities major
at the university.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.742
His specialty
was sumerian culture.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.277
Did you say
sumerian culture?

10:12.279 --> 10:15.947
I know, it's crazy, right?

10:15.949 --> 10:18.717
Aaron was always so smart
about that stuff.

10:19.885 --> 10:21.152
Was?

10:21.154 --> 10:23.955
He's in the hospital.
It's pretty bad.

10:25.258 --> 10:28.059
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:29.662 --> 10:31.896
What, um--

10:31.898 --> 10:33.832
what happened?

10:33.834 --> 10:35.834
There was this priest.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.169
At least that's what
he called himself.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.839
He contacted Aaron.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.342
Was it about
the investigation or--

10:44.344 --> 10:48.413
he thought whatever it was
that he could control it.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.682
But really
it controlled him.

10:52.885 --> 10:57.922
Are you saying that
you were set up by this...

10:57.924 --> 11:00.792
Priest or--

11:00.794 --> 11:03.061
we were invited
and we accepted.

11:03.063 --> 11:06.398
That's the way it works.
That's the deception.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.900
And you were invited
by the priest?

11:12.271 --> 11:14.873
There's no turning back now.

11:16.709 --> 11:21.813
So you said that Aaron
called them scalers?

11:21.815 --> 11:24.883
He had this old book
with transcriptions in it.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.720
Aaron kept talking
about the scalers.

11:28.722 --> 11:31.423
The priest called them
sentients.

11:31.425 --> 11:33.124
The same thing, I think.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.927
Sentients. I'm not--

11:35.929 --> 11:37.128
I'm sorry.
I'm confused.

11:37.130 --> 11:40.832
How do I get a hold
of this priest?

11:40.834 --> 11:44.202
I don't know. It's--

11:44.204 --> 11:47.772
I've never had
this feeling before.

11:47.774 --> 11:49.207
And it's affecting us...

11:53.279 --> 11:54.713
All.

12:12.164 --> 12:14.165
Thank you.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.927
All right, remember,
if you get dizzy,

12:42.929 --> 12:42.927
lightheaded, anything,

12:42.929 --> 12:45.830
you say something
so we can get you out of here.

12:45.832 --> 12:48.366
Why are you looking at me?

12:48.368 --> 12:51.402
-Don't take it personal.
-Remember last time?

12:51.404 --> 12:54.072
Maybe they just like me
more than the two of you.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.007
All right, come on, guys.
This way.

13:18.831 --> 13:21.132
Oh, wow.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.401
Yep, this is definitely
the place.

13:23.403 --> 13:26.037
You're totally getting
extra credit for this.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.006
I swear, you're into
the weirdest things.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.909
I mean, I can't believe you
talked me into this.

13:33.546 --> 13:36.981
Eat your heart out,
ghostbusters.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.216
Here we go.

13:42.121 --> 13:45.256
-You ready?
-Yeah.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.360
I swear, you're into
the weirdest things.

13:58.971 --> 14:01.940
Here. These are yours.

14:05.611 --> 14:07.612
Really?

14:12.051 --> 14:14.352
It doesn't feel
any different.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.490
Nope. Doesn't smell
any different.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.492
Justin?

14:21.494 --> 14:23.228
Never touch the stuff.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.930
Just set up
for the evp session.

14:25.932 --> 14:27.599
Okay, Aaron.

14:34.406 --> 14:37.408
Ooh, first find.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.644
That's cool.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.980
You just paid my tuition.

14:43.349 --> 14:46.050
What do you think it is?

14:46.052 --> 14:48.253
About three semesters
worth, at least.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.989
-Here.
-You know what I mean.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.056
Got it.

14:52.058 --> 14:55.393
Haley, you are on infrared.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.195
And I think,
if I remember correctly,

14:57.197 --> 15:00.531
we wanna go this way.

16:21.180 --> 16:23.381
But this is just
a ghost hunt, right?

16:23.383 --> 16:25.116
Because that's
what you told me.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.285
Yes...

16:27.287 --> 16:29.487
-And no.
-Aaron!

16:29.489 --> 16:31.522
Okay, are there ghosts? Yes.

16:31.524 --> 16:34.492
Am I looking for a ghost?

16:34.494 --> 16:37.562
It's really more
of a spiritual remnant

16:37.564 --> 16:40.031
of a forgotten race
kind of thing.

16:40.033 --> 16:44.002
-Residual haunting?
-Not really.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.670
Basically,
when the scalers got here

16:45.672 --> 16:50.675
they found that human females
were attractive and they--

16:50.677 --> 16:52.010
and had their scaler
way with them.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.445
Justin, you're disgusting.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.047
I thought
you were just joking.

16:56.049 --> 16:58.049
I wasn't joking. Basically,

16:58.051 --> 17:00.418
I think that there were more
genetic alterations

17:00.420 --> 17:02.353
made to suit the scalers

17:02.355 --> 17:04.055
to make the humans
better slaves.

17:04.057 --> 17:07.191
And when these hybrids die,
their souls or spirits

17:07.193 --> 17:08.326
or whatever you want
to call them,

17:08.328 --> 17:10.127
got stuck intra-dimensionally.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.497
They couldn't move on
to the next life.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.066
Whatever constitutes
next life.

17:15.068 --> 17:16.501
Basically,
now they're here

17:16.502 --> 17:20.204
just waiting
for human interaction.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.740
And then what?

17:22.742 --> 17:26.411
Well, I don't know.
Actually, I've never gotten
this close before.

17:26.413 --> 17:31.582
The old texts are cryptic,
but they do mention some clues.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.551
And?

17:33.553 --> 17:35.686
I know they need
human interaction.

17:35.688 --> 17:39.057
-Like a priest?
-Yeah.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.625
Also, they're connected
geographically.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.794
Now to what extent,
i have no idea.

17:42.796 --> 17:44.629
Geographically?
Like these catacombs?

17:44.631 --> 17:46.798
Yeah, they don't seem
to be able to move very far

17:46.800 --> 17:50.201
past the origin point,
which I believe is here.

17:50.203 --> 17:53.471
So what happens
when we find them?

17:53.473 --> 17:55.840
Well, the scaler
that may be here

17:55.842 --> 17:57.208
already has
a human connection,

17:57.210 --> 18:00.511
so I don't know.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.113
I hope to find out.

18:02.115 --> 18:05.316
They're not gonna
hurt us, right?

18:07.686 --> 18:10.254
-That was a question, Aaron.
-Watch your step, guys.

18:10.256 --> 18:11.823
-Aaron!
-I think it's this way.

18:28.640 --> 18:31.142
I think I'm rolling. I am.

18:34.347 --> 18:35.513
A lot of people
think that ghosts

18:35.515 --> 18:37.815
are purely incorporeal beings

18:37.817 --> 18:40.418
and they don't
actually interact
with our physical realm.

18:40.420 --> 18:43.855
This bad boy is going to
show us otherwise.

18:45.491 --> 18:47.425
So what does it mean
if all the lights light up?

18:47.427 --> 18:48.726
Is it a lot of vibration?

18:48.728 --> 18:50.862
-It means run.
-Run. Run quick.

18:50.864 --> 18:53.397
It's got that
"Blair witch" vibe.

18:53.399 --> 18:55.600
- You hear that echo?
-Yeah.

18:55.602 --> 18:58.169
That was just your voice
and it was just right here.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.471
- We're gonna record--
-hello?

19:02.242 --> 19:04.842
So we're underneath
the old church now

19:04.844 --> 19:07.478
in these weird tunnels.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.580
Aaron, say hi.

19:10.916 --> 19:13.284
Come on!

19:13.286 --> 19:17.255
So, they're really dark,
musty, really hard to see,

19:17.257 --> 19:19.190
but luckily we've got
Aaron up here

19:19.192 --> 19:23.161
who's leading the-- Aaron?

19:23.163 --> 19:24.762
Hey.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.731
Man up, Haley.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.633
How did you do that?

19:31.336 --> 19:32.737
All right, hang on guys,
i wanna make sure

19:32.739 --> 19:34.505
we're going
the right way here.

19:36.508 --> 19:42.213
According to these notes,
we need to go...

19:42.215 --> 19:43.581
That way.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.883
That's so creepy.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.518
Creepy is as creepy does.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.520
All right, Forrest Gump.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.956
Hey, how about stop fooling
around so we can get moving

19:51.958 --> 19:53.558
before the cops get here.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.193
-Cops?
-What?

19:55.195 --> 19:56.794
You didn't say
anything about cops.

19:56.796 --> 19:59.297
Aaron, you said we had
permission to be here.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.465
Yeah, well, sort of.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.968
Sort of?
Can you define sort of?

20:03.970 --> 20:06.771
It's ghost hunting, man.
You break rules.

20:06.773 --> 20:09.540
Watch out, Justin.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.509
Dead bird, 12 o'clock.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.444
Ooh, evidence
from the other side.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.646
It's "parrot normal".

20:16.748 --> 20:18.216
How's the emf?

20:19.552 --> 20:22.787
So where to now, Aaron,
master ghost hunter?

20:22.789 --> 20:24.889
Well...

20:27.960 --> 20:30.595
Justin!

20:30.597 --> 20:32.263
Whoo-ooh.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.314
Look, low stalactites.

20:54.453 --> 20:56.721
I mean, I can't even--

20:56.723 --> 20:58.756
guys, my flashlight's
not working anymore.

21:00.726 --> 21:04.528
Guys, my flashlight's dead.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.697
Sometimes they intentionally
drain the battery.

21:06.699 --> 21:08.833
Keep an eye on that one,
because they'll use the energy

21:08.835 --> 21:10.001
to communicate sometimes.

21:10.003 --> 21:13.771
-And will it restore?
-Maybe.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.673
Aaron, will you flash
your light back here?

21:15.675 --> 21:18.009
Mine's still dead.

21:18.011 --> 21:19.677
Watch your step, Justin.

21:33.325 --> 21:35.993
This chair's freaking me
out a little.

21:35.995 --> 21:38.696
--See?

21:38.698 --> 21:40.998
-Huh.
-Great.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.068
It's sitting in the middle
of this abandoned room

21:44.070 --> 21:48.606
in the crypt on a pile
that looks like ash and rock.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.311
Metal?

21:53.313 --> 21:56.514
Can you shine your light
over this way?

21:56.516 --> 21:58.015
There's a tunnel.

21:58.017 --> 22:00.651
And there's chains
on the wall.

22:00.653 --> 22:03.587
Not creepy at all. Nope.

22:03.589 --> 22:06.324
Chains?

22:06.326 --> 22:08.426
They don't even feel
like metal anymore.

22:08.428 --> 22:11.796
Aah! Somebody
hung them up there.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.898
Looks like beef jerky.

22:20.906 --> 22:23.574
It's like they're,
i don't know,

22:23.576 --> 22:25.509
having some kind
of ritual or--

22:30.682 --> 22:32.049
it's certainly possible.

22:32.051 --> 22:34.885
There has been
cult activity in the area.

22:34.887 --> 22:36.921
I wouldn't be surprised
if it was connected.

22:36.923 --> 22:39.457
What more could you want
for capturing little children?

22:39.459 --> 22:41.025
It's getting colder, too.
Do you feel colder?

22:43.363 --> 22:44.795
It does feel colder.

25:07.639 --> 25:13.644
I think the inner chamber
should be this way.

25:13.646 --> 25:16.080
You really think
you're gonna find it?

25:16.082 --> 25:18.816
I think we're gonna
find something,

25:18.818 --> 25:22.953
and I think it's going
to be monumental.

25:22.955 --> 25:24.188
If it's so monumental,

25:24.190 --> 25:25.623
why hasn't someone
been here before

25:25.625 --> 25:26.924
and found it already?

25:26.926 --> 25:28.726
Well, I mean,
the entrance was hidden.

25:28.728 --> 25:31.695
I'm thinking people
just forgot about the place.

25:31.697 --> 25:34.532
But if we can find
the inner chamber,

25:34.534 --> 25:35.866
that'll be the prize.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.536
Inner chamber?

25:38.538 --> 25:41.038
Yeah, the old texts
describe it

25:41.040 --> 25:43.040
kind of like
the ark of the covenant.

25:45.911 --> 25:47.611
Indiana Jones?

25:47.613 --> 25:51.081
It's where the host
would summon the scaler.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.950
Like an altar?

25:52.952 --> 25:55.219
Only the priest
could access it.

25:55.221 --> 25:59.023
Well, up until tonight,
if we're lucky.

26:03.328 --> 26:05.996
-Did you hear that?
-What?

26:20.779 --> 26:21.779
All right.

26:21.781 --> 26:23.814
Oh, my god.

26:49.240 --> 26:50.374
Can I help you?

26:50.376 --> 26:53.010
Hello, my name is Jessica lake

26:53.012 --> 26:55.980
and I was hoping
to ask you a few questions

26:55.982 --> 26:59.016
-about Aaron.
-Are you a friend of Aaron's?

26:59.018 --> 27:00.718
Not exactly.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.653
I'm doing a report on
a paranormal investigation

27:02.655 --> 27:04.121
he was involved with

27:04.123 --> 27:06.357
and I'm just trying to get
some questions answered.

27:06.359 --> 27:09.360
Well, I'm afraid
i wouldn't be of much help.

27:09.362 --> 27:11.962
-Aaron is-- yes.
-In the hospital.

27:11.964 --> 27:15.366
Well, come in, come in,
come in, come in.

27:18.136 --> 27:21.839
What is it you were
wanting to know?

27:21.841 --> 27:24.008
I've received some footage
and an article

27:24.010 --> 27:25.809
and Aaron was in it.

27:25.811 --> 27:29.046
Aaron's sick because
of that, you know.

27:29.048 --> 27:31.148
How so?

27:31.150 --> 27:34.184
Well, I was never interested

27:34.186 --> 27:36.120
for him to be doing
those interviews,

27:36.122 --> 27:38.222
but he was drawn to it.

27:38.224 --> 27:41.425
You see, he has
a degree in history.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.661
Ancient history.

27:43.663 --> 27:45.729
Did he ever mention
anything to you

27:45.731 --> 27:48.899
about the priest
he was working with?

27:48.901 --> 27:53.203
Yes, and Aaron's never
been the same since.

27:53.205 --> 27:57.241
He's more withdrawn
than before,

27:57.243 --> 28:00.778
-almost scared.
-Of the priest?

28:00.780 --> 28:02.846
Well, he never said
so much as that.

28:02.848 --> 28:06.150
It was-- it was like
he found something,

28:06.152 --> 28:11.855
something very old,
very ancient and sinister.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.958
It bothered him.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.428
Did he ever show you
any of his research?

28:17.430 --> 28:23.434
Uh, yes, it--
this is Aaron's.

28:23.436 --> 28:25.836
This is it right here.

28:25.838 --> 28:27.037
This is Aaron's.

28:27.039 --> 28:30.074
Now you can look
through it if you like.

28:30.076 --> 28:33.744
I don't think there's
anything I can add to it.

28:33.746 --> 28:36.380
Do you know how I can
get ahold of his priest?

28:36.382 --> 28:38.749
I don't think that would
be a very good idea.

28:41.286 --> 28:42.920
Is that his laptop?

28:42.922 --> 28:46.356
Uh, yes. Yeah, that's
just the way he left it.

28:46.358 --> 28:49.159
Aaron did an interview
with the priest,

28:49.161 --> 28:51.862
and I think
it's on the computer.

28:51.864 --> 28:53.964
-Do you mind?
-No.

28:58.069 --> 29:00.304
Okay, so just
to start off here,

29:00.306 --> 29:01.772
can you tell me your name?

29:01.774 --> 29:04.475
Yes, it's Richard abney.

29:04.477 --> 29:06.443
And just to make sure,
do I have permission

29:06.445 --> 29:09.279
to use this interview
for my documentary?

29:09.281 --> 29:10.881
Yes, of course.

29:10.883 --> 29:14.384
By profession,
you are a priest, correct?

29:14.386 --> 29:15.953
Am I understanding
that correctly?

29:15.955 --> 29:17.387
Well, yes and no.

29:17.389 --> 29:18.856
I'm ordained,

29:18.858 --> 29:21.492
but I'm not practicing
at the moment.

29:21.494 --> 29:23.260
I don't understand.

29:23.262 --> 29:28.132
I have just taken some time off
in doing the lord's work.

29:28.134 --> 29:30.100
Okay, can you tell me

29:30.102 --> 29:32.269
about your experiences
at the church?

29:32.271 --> 29:35.072
My paranormal experience?

29:35.074 --> 29:37.508
Yeah, I'm sorry.
You mentioned some kind
of presence

29:37.510 --> 29:39.042
while you were there?

29:39.044 --> 29:42.980
Yes, well,
it's definitely something.

29:42.982 --> 29:45.115
When I'm there alone
standing by the altar,

29:45.117 --> 29:47.851
I can sometimes catch it
moving back in the corner.

29:51.890 --> 29:56.393
It seems to interact with me
and I can communicate with it.

29:56.395 --> 29:59.129
So how do you--
how do you do that?

29:59.131 --> 30:01.431
- Communicate with it?
-Yes, yeah.

30:01.433 --> 30:05.969
It alerts me that it's present
by causing a physical reaction.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.504
How so?

30:07.506 --> 30:11.441
I usually get
a slight pressure.

30:11.443 --> 30:13.811
Then I know it's here.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.546
What do you think it is?

30:15.548 --> 30:18.515
I have done research
on the sentients

30:18.517 --> 30:21.852
and it seems to have many
of their characteristics.

30:21.854 --> 30:24.388
My sense is that
it's an ancient spirit.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.290
In the book of Enoch,

30:26.292 --> 30:28.458
they are referred to
as the fallen ones.

30:28.460 --> 30:31.328
They can be found in
the sumerian texts as well.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.998
This is not extraterrestrial.
It's inter-dimensional.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.502
It can travel irregardless
of time and space.

30:38.504 --> 30:41.972
It's a beautiful thing, really,
when you think about it,

30:41.974 --> 30:45.042
but it seeks human contact.

30:45.044 --> 30:48.478
In what way?

30:48.480 --> 30:51.915
It has to feel
on our physical plane

30:51.917 --> 30:54.418
an ability that was taken away
thousands of years ago.

30:54.420 --> 30:58.856
It needs to connect
to the fire of a human soul.

30:58.858 --> 31:01.358
Such longing.

31:01.360 --> 31:04.294
So how was this ability
taken away then?

31:08.566 --> 31:11.368
A perpetual
misunderstanding, really.

31:11.370 --> 31:14.304
Misdirected lust, possibly.

31:14.306 --> 31:17.274
But purgatory
for the end of all time.

31:17.276 --> 31:19.610
So sad for such a state.

31:22.881 --> 31:26.917
So you have empathy then
for the spirit?

31:28.920 --> 31:31.288
I understand its loneliness.

31:32.991 --> 31:35.125
So what happens to the living

31:35.127 --> 31:36.994
that come into contact
with the spirit?

31:39.497 --> 31:43.033
They receive
the greatest gift.

31:43.035 --> 31:46.637
The true knowledge.
The awakening.

31:46.639 --> 31:51.241
Is anybody else freezing
just like all of a sudden?

31:51.243 --> 31:53.543
It does feel like
it's getting colder,
doesn't it?

31:53.545 --> 31:55.412
-Way colder.
-Oh, yeah.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.314
-I saw that.
-Did you get a boost?

31:57.316 --> 32:00.317
A spike?
Did you get a spike?

32:00.319 --> 32:03.320
See, and you guys didn't think
we were going the right way.

32:05.523 --> 32:06.657
"Deus vult."

32:08.126 --> 32:11.261
That's interesting.
Can I have this?

32:11.263 --> 32:14.364
-Yes. Yeah.
-Well, thank you.

32:14.366 --> 32:17.000
Now, you be careful.

32:17.002 --> 32:18.402
Whatever it is
you're looking for

32:18.404 --> 32:21.104
has a power to hurt people.

32:45.596 --> 32:48.465
-Professor kilgore.
-Hello, professor kilgore.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.500
My name is Jessica lake,
and I'm researching a project

32:50.502 --> 32:53.337
that one of your former
students was working on.

32:53.339 --> 32:55.405
I'm really busy right now.

32:55.407 --> 32:57.574
-What's his name?
-Aaron ramuel.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.076
He would have been
in your antiquities class.

32:59.078 --> 33:00.978
-He was working on--
-i know who he is

33:00.980 --> 33:02.312
and I can't help you.

33:02.314 --> 33:03.613
Do you know anything
about why he was working

33:03.615 --> 33:06.683
-on the project?
-Where is Aaron?

33:06.685 --> 33:08.752
Um, I'm sorry to say
he's really sick

33:08.754 --> 33:10.354
and in the hospital right now.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.990
-I can't help you.
-Professor, look, I just--

33:12.992 --> 33:14.324
I just need a few minutes
of your time--

33:14.326 --> 33:16.259
sorry.

33:33.344 --> 33:35.645
We're about to conduct
a ghost box session,

33:35.647 --> 33:38.482
which is basically--
what a ghost box is is it's--

33:38.484 --> 33:41.284
it's constantly scanning
radio frequencies.

33:41.286 --> 33:44.454
So rather than recording,
like we do with our evp's,

33:44.456 --> 33:47.457
this will pick and choose
little bits of dialogue

33:47.459 --> 33:49.693
from random radio stations,

33:49.695 --> 33:51.661
and the spirits can then use
those to communicate

33:51.663 --> 33:53.130
with us, if they choose.

33:53.132 --> 33:56.400
-Huh.
-So ask a question.

33:56.402 --> 33:58.268
What is your name?

34:01.306 --> 34:03.373
Michael. Michael.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.541
- Michael?
- -Is that--

34:07.713 --> 34:09.413
did it say "death"?

34:11.216 --> 34:13.717
Ugh! Something keeps
dripping on me.

34:15.453 --> 34:17.387
What do you know
about scalers?

34:20.525 --> 34:21.690
What did he say?

34:23.694 --> 34:26.563
What do you know
about scalers?

34:37.409 --> 34:39.743
Are there any scalers
down here with us?

34:43.482 --> 34:45.449
Yes?

34:47.819 --> 34:52.289
I don't... really...

34:52.291 --> 34:54.224
- Hell.
- -Hell?

34:54.226 --> 34:56.760
All right. Let's move on.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.295
You're dripping.

34:58.297 --> 35:00.664
- Murder?
- -Hell.

35:06.204 --> 35:08.839
What is dripping on us?

35:47.812 --> 35:49.913
Are you trying
to communicate with us?

35:49.915 --> 35:53.183
Scaler.

35:53.185 --> 35:55.652
Are you the spirit
known as a scaler?

35:55.654 --> 35:58.388
Scaler. Scaler.

36:00.191 --> 36:02.826
Ask a question.

36:02.828 --> 36:05.629
- I think it said--
-ask you a question.

36:05.631 --> 36:10.600
- "Ask you a question?"
-Yes.

36:10.602 --> 36:12.903
Wait a minute, you wanna
ask us a question?

36:12.905 --> 36:15.205
Yes.

36:15.207 --> 36:16.840
Okay.

36:16.842 --> 36:20.644
Do you want--

36:25.183 --> 36:29.686
do you-- you want?

36:29.688 --> 36:33.290
Do you want?
Do you want?

36:35.359 --> 36:37.394
Do you want?

36:38.963 --> 36:40.931
Do you?

36:40.933 --> 36:42.866
Do you want?
Do you want?

36:43.901 --> 36:45.335
Do you want?

36:45.337 --> 36:49.439
Do you want?
Do you want? Do you--

36:49.441 --> 36:50.874
do you want?

36:52.811 --> 36:54.678
Temperature
is definitely dropping.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.846
Are you a watcher?

36:56.848 --> 36:58.949
Do you want? Do you--

37:00.851 --> 37:02.752
die.

37:03.688 --> 37:05.589
Do you?

37:44.695 --> 37:46.363
Can you tell us your name?

37:51.269 --> 37:52.435
There must be interference.

37:52.437 --> 37:55.272
Can you tell us your name?

37:56.874 --> 37:58.475
Sounds like--

37:58.477 --> 37:59.909
it's not coming
from the ghost box.

38:03.881 --> 38:05.482
Are you here with us?

38:19.530 --> 38:21.898
-You all right?
-Yeah.

38:25.636 --> 38:27.904
Yeah.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.739
The dust in here,

38:29.741 --> 38:31.875
it's in my throat.

38:35.846 --> 38:40.417
I-- I can stop.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.557
Professor.
Professor kilgore.

39:20.559 --> 39:23.093
Professor, I need to know
more about scalers.

39:23.095 --> 39:25.628
And sentients. Please!

39:28.666 --> 39:31.801
Professor, look,
i really need your help.

39:34.538 --> 39:37.040
Professor kilgore,
i need to know about scalers.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.876
And sentients. Please!

39:39.878 --> 39:42.846
Sumerian texts--
the fallen ones.

39:42.848 --> 39:45.749
Our system was invaded
200,000 years ago.

39:45.751 --> 39:47.417
What do you mean by that?

39:47.419 --> 39:49.152
Aaron was working on
old writings from that era.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.421
He found evidence
of souls here

39:51.423 --> 39:53.556
held in some sort
of purgatory.

39:53.558 --> 39:55.992
Scalers, demons, sentients--

39:55.994 --> 39:57.927
different names
for the same thing.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.662
These spirits
can't leave here.

39:59.664 --> 40:02.499
They're trapped.
Agony, darkness--

40:02.501 --> 40:04.768
they feed off
human suffering.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.169
What do you mean?

40:06.171 --> 40:08.838
It's the way in for them.

40:08.840 --> 40:12.108
If you let them
into your world,

40:12.110 --> 40:13.510
they never leave.

40:13.512 --> 40:16.980
They never leave...

40:25.956 --> 40:28.825
Guys, this is it.

40:28.827 --> 40:31.094
Where is this place?

40:31.096 --> 40:33.630
It's the inner chambers.

40:33.632 --> 40:36.199
There's a reason they built
the church here.

40:36.201 --> 40:37.600
And that is?

40:37.602 --> 40:40.637
The origin point.

40:40.639 --> 40:42.572
They knew it was here.

42:19.203 --> 42:21.671
You don't know what you've
got yourself into.

42:38.856 --> 42:40.189
All right, you guys ready?

42:40.191 --> 42:41.324
Got it.

42:43.594 --> 42:47.263
-Haley?
-Yeah.

42:47.265 --> 42:48.631
You know, there's
probably a reason

42:48.633 --> 42:50.099
that this is
on the other side,

42:50.101 --> 42:53.036
and I don't think
we should be messing with it.

42:53.038 --> 42:55.238
Haley, we're all
the way down here.

42:55.240 --> 42:57.073
We are this close.

42:57.075 --> 42:59.676
Can you please hold out
a little bit longer?

42:59.678 --> 43:01.210
Okay, fine.

43:06.251 --> 43:09.752
Can you tell us your name?

43:11.923 --> 43:13.323
Haley.

43:16.794 --> 43:19.062
Did you just say Haley?

43:19.064 --> 43:21.030
Can't see.

43:21.032 --> 43:22.999
Can see?

43:23.001 --> 43:27.370
Haley, can see.

43:27.372 --> 43:29.739
Haley can-- what?

43:47.257 --> 43:49.959
Are you getting
all of this, Haley?

43:49.961 --> 43:52.929
Haley! Haley!
Haley! Haley!

43:52.931 --> 43:55.231
Yeah? No.

43:55.233 --> 44:00.036
-I don't know.
-What's wrong?

44:00.038 --> 44:02.672
I just saw--

44:02.674 --> 44:04.340
thought you saw what?

44:04.342 --> 44:06.376
Nothing. Just-- nothing.

44:07.645 --> 44:09.212
I really don't like this.

45:48.412 --> 45:50.279
What the hell is that?

45:57.989 --> 46:02.058
Hey! I just wanted to come by
and see if it was still okay

46:02.060 --> 46:04.026
to watch kaley tonight,
just for a few hours?

46:04.028 --> 46:05.261
Yeah, um...

46:05.263 --> 46:06.462
Did you just knock
on my door?

46:06.464 --> 46:10.099
-Uh, yeah.
-Like a minute ago?

46:10.101 --> 46:12.068
I don't understand.

46:12.070 --> 46:14.403
Somebody knocked on my door.

46:14.405 --> 46:16.072
Okay, it was me.

46:16.074 --> 46:18.775
No, it was a single--
like that.

46:18.777 --> 46:21.344
Okay, maybe I shouldn't leave
kaley here tonight?

46:21.346 --> 46:25.281
Funny. No, it's fine.
Um, when are you leaving?

46:25.283 --> 46:28.484
Um, around 8,
and I'll be back around 10?

46:28.486 --> 46:30.386
Okay, yeah.
That's fine, mm-hmm.

46:30.388 --> 46:31.788
-Okay.
-All right, yeah.

46:31.790 --> 46:33.823
-Thank you. Bye.
-Mm-hmm, bye.

46:58.882 --> 47:01.184
Is there anyone
here with us?

47:11.361 --> 47:14.197
Is there anyone that would like
to communicate with us?

47:17.935 --> 47:20.970
Spirit, how old are you?

47:24.576 --> 47:26.576
All right.
That was something.

47:26.578 --> 47:29.512
Did you get something?

47:29.514 --> 47:33.516
Spirit, are you a scaler?

47:35.053 --> 47:37.119
I got two megagauss.

47:37.121 --> 47:40.456
--Temperature dropping.

47:40.458 --> 47:45.862
--Okay. Are you sentient?

47:47.065 --> 47:48.898
Another read at 10 degrees.

47:48.900 --> 47:50.900
-It's been 20
since we started.
-All right, well.

47:50.902 --> 47:52.568
-Is anybody feeling it?
-Yeah.

47:52.570 --> 47:54.370
-It's 50 degrees.
-That's our answer
right there.

47:54.372 --> 47:55.972
It's still climbing.
It's still climbing, guys.

47:55.974 --> 47:58.474
10 megagauss.

48:03.280 --> 48:04.981
His name is Richard abney.

48:04.983 --> 48:06.649
I'll send over
his contact information.

48:06.651 --> 48:09.151
He says he has access
to the old church.

48:09.153 --> 48:10.253
All right.

48:25.469 --> 48:28.237
Father abney?

48:28.239 --> 48:30.273
Excuse me, father.

48:30.275 --> 48:32.909
You must be Jessica.

48:34.945 --> 48:37.346
It's my understanding
that you know some information

48:37.348 --> 48:40.349
about Aaron's investigation
at the church.

48:40.351 --> 48:43.085
I had been
in contact with him.

48:43.087 --> 48:45.254
Can you tell me
about sentients?

48:45.256 --> 48:46.622
The fallen ones?

48:46.624 --> 48:49.125
Do you believe?

48:49.127 --> 48:50.593
Do I believe?

48:50.595 --> 48:55.264
I mean, do you have faith?

48:55.266 --> 48:58.601
Well, if you're asking me
if I'm religious,

48:58.603 --> 49:01.003
I don't follow
a particular faith.

49:01.005 --> 49:02.972
Interesting.

49:02.974 --> 49:04.607
You deal with spirits

49:04.609 --> 49:06.475
in your writings
on the paranormal,

49:06.477 --> 49:08.678
but you don't believe
in a god.

49:08.680 --> 49:12.248
I believe in investigation
and understanding.

49:12.250 --> 49:16.218
Facts can change.
Life can change.

49:16.220 --> 49:18.387
Opinions and variables
in constant flux.

49:18.389 --> 49:20.656
But if there's one thing
that doesn't change,

49:20.658 --> 49:23.225
it's the process of faith.

49:23.227 --> 49:25.561
I have faith in myself.

49:25.563 --> 49:29.332
It supersedes everything,
even death itself.

49:31.001 --> 49:32.501
And that's your opinion.

49:32.503 --> 49:33.970
You're a man of the cloth.

49:33.972 --> 49:36.472
Even when everything
else is lost,

49:36.474 --> 49:38.975
and hope is a commodity
that we don't have,

49:38.977 --> 49:42.078
there is always faith
to serve as our foundation.

49:42.080 --> 49:45.581
Yes, but I've found that--

49:45.583 --> 49:48.184
it was the basis
of our own lives,

49:48.186 --> 49:49.618
and the passions
that drive us.

49:49.620 --> 49:51.988
Evil can strip away
all of our person,

49:51.990 --> 49:54.557
but it cannot take
a human's faith.

49:57.494 --> 50:01.063
Sorry. You're interested
in the research

50:01.065 --> 50:02.431
that Aaron was doing?

50:02.433 --> 50:04.200
Yes.

50:04.202 --> 50:07.436
He was curious
about the paranormal
experiences

50:07.438 --> 50:08.738
that I've had
at the old church.

50:08.740 --> 50:10.506
Can you tell me about that?

50:10.508 --> 50:13.175
I noticed it first
in the catacombs.

50:13.177 --> 50:15.277
I had been on sabbatical

50:15.279 --> 50:18.381
revaluating
my spiritual direction.

50:18.383 --> 50:22.284
I found the catacombs quiet
and refreshing for my mind.

50:23.520 --> 50:26.122
At first it was a feeling,

50:26.124 --> 50:28.391
a presence,
cooler temperatures,

50:28.393 --> 50:30.292
breeze when there
shouldn't have been.

50:30.294 --> 50:35.097
Then the headaches
and the visions.

50:35.099 --> 50:37.166
Visions?

50:37.168 --> 50:41.237
Quite vivid, as if the walls
were speaking to me.

50:44.475 --> 50:46.375
What were they saying?

50:46.377 --> 50:51.080
Inaudible at first.
Just noise, like static.

50:51.082 --> 50:52.681
That was followed
by brief words,

50:52.683 --> 50:54.683
and over time,
complete thoughts.

50:59.524 --> 51:03.559
I have to ask you this.

51:03.561 --> 51:08.297
Were you on any medications
at the time or anything?

51:08.299 --> 51:11.467
I was on my spiritual journey,
seeking my path,

51:11.469 --> 51:15.337
and those steps
lead me to the--

51:15.339 --> 51:17.606
spirit.

51:17.608 --> 51:21.243
I believe it lives
or manifests itself there.

51:23.080 --> 51:27.550
A lonely, ancient being longing
for human companionship.

51:29.319 --> 51:32.288
And you're providing that?

51:32.290 --> 51:36.725
I am not worthy
to be its companion,
but I can serve.

51:36.727 --> 51:40.429
Is this your god?

51:40.431 --> 51:44.867
You must go to the church.
You can see for yourself.

51:48.705 --> 51:51.740
Do you know what happened
to those ghost hunters
that night?

51:51.742 --> 51:55.377
They were harmed
by their own fears.

51:55.379 --> 51:58.314
Very cryptic, father.

51:58.316 --> 52:00.749
I'm not practicing
the traditional faith.

52:00.751 --> 52:03.385
Please call me Richard.

52:03.387 --> 52:07.289
So what happens when a human
comes in contact with a spirit?

52:07.291 --> 52:11.160
Well that depends on one's
particular faith, doesn't it?

52:12.529 --> 52:14.430
Deus vult.

52:26.877 --> 52:30.312
They called it a sentient,

52:30.314 --> 52:33.315
basically
an ancient spirit,

52:33.317 --> 52:36.519
and he's got the capability
to track you...

52:39.390 --> 52:41.924
-Huh.
-Great.

52:52.469 --> 52:54.203
Is there anyone here with us?

52:59.243 --> 53:01.610
Is there anyone that would
like to communicate with us?

53:01.612 --> 53:02.912
I got my temperature
dropping.

53:05.249 --> 53:07.850
We're at 63 from 65 now.

53:11.855 --> 53:13.322
You all right?

53:13.324 --> 53:15.958
Yeah, I'm just getting
really dizzy.

53:22.300 --> 53:26.535
-Hey, are you okay?
-My eyes.

53:26.537 --> 53:29.371
Are you trying
to communicate with us?

53:29.373 --> 53:31.340
Okay, I'm gonna knock
on your door now,

53:31.342 --> 53:32.675
just in case
you're hearing other knocks

53:32.677 --> 53:32.675
and you didn't know
it was me.

53:32.677 --> 53:35.611
Do you want us
to communicate with you?

53:35.613 --> 53:37.580
It's complicated.

53:37.582 --> 53:38.781
Anybody else--

53:40.617 --> 53:42.351
it's me. Did you hear
a knocking?

53:42.353 --> 53:44.420
-Yes.
-Good.

53:44.422 --> 53:45.888
-All right.
-I'll be back by 11:00.

53:45.890 --> 53:47.523
Wait, I thought you
were gonna be back by 10.

53:47.525 --> 53:50.226
-Gotta go. He's waiting.
-All right.

53:50.228 --> 53:52.261
You ready?
Wanna play some games?

54:52.055 --> 54:54.590
Are we the only ones here?

54:54.592 --> 54:55.824
Why do you ask?

55:20.650 --> 55:21.950
It's okay.

55:34.097 --> 55:35.531
Again?

55:35.533 --> 55:38.534
Sorry, Jess,
he's just so... amazing.

55:38.536 --> 55:40.536
Mommy, I'm tired.

55:40.538 --> 55:43.672
Oh. Okay, baby.

55:43.674 --> 55:46.075
Thank you so much.
I owe you.

55:46.077 --> 55:47.576
All right.
Good night, Dee.

55:47.578 --> 55:48.844
Good night.

55:55.419 --> 55:57.386
Oh, Aaron.

56:02.792 --> 56:06.628
Why? Why?

57:32.048 --> 57:34.483
This is it.

57:34.485 --> 57:36.785
Wow, they even left it
set up for us.

57:36.787 --> 57:39.721
How thoughtful.

57:39.723 --> 57:44.726
If I'm not mistaken,
i think we could actually
summon the creature.

57:44.728 --> 57:46.628
I think it would
manifest itself.

57:46.630 --> 57:49.064
Aaron, you literally
sound insane.

57:49.066 --> 57:50.799
For once I agree with Haley.

57:50.801 --> 57:55.504
Look, we are this close.

57:55.506 --> 57:57.005
We've come all this way.

57:57.007 --> 58:02.044
Literally all of my research
points to this moment.

58:02.046 --> 58:03.879
Justin?

58:05.949 --> 58:07.649
I.R. Camera.

58:07.651 --> 58:08.717
Haley?

58:12.155 --> 58:13.889
Temperature.

58:29.739 --> 58:32.007
Temperature drop. 66.

58:32.009 --> 58:35.043
64. 63 and holding.

58:39.083 --> 58:40.716
Just curious, but you--

58:40.718 --> 58:42.217
you do still have
that holy water, right?

58:51.961 --> 58:53.262
Are there any spirits here

58:53.264 --> 58:55.097
that wish
to communicate with us?

59:03.540 --> 59:05.574
That was freaky.

59:11.881 --> 59:15.017
If that was you,
could you do that again?

59:17.654 --> 59:19.154
Okay.

59:19.156 --> 59:22.824
Did you used to live here
at this church?

59:25.194 --> 59:26.595
That was creepy.

59:26.597 --> 59:28.297
Justin, start
the night vision.

59:42.613 --> 59:44.246
Temperature drop.

59:44.248 --> 59:46.315
61, 60.

59:54.123 --> 59:55.991
Another spike.

59:55.993 --> 59:57.859
Aaron, Haley's light.

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:05.634
Guys, it's here.

01:00:05.636 --> 01:00:06.969
There's something.

01:00:06.971 --> 01:00:09.771
It's around me.
I can feel it.

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:12.908
Are you the spirit that Haley's
reacting to right now?

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:44.272
Yeah, I just got a spike.

01:00:44.274 --> 01:00:46.208
I just got another spike.

01:00:47.678 --> 01:00:50.646
Temperature
is definitely dropping.

01:00:51.849 --> 01:00:53.048
Come on, come on.

01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:15.237
What is your name?

01:01:15.239 --> 01:01:16.838
What would you like
to be called?

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:24.713
Another spike. God!

01:01:24.715 --> 01:01:26.982
Justin? Here.

01:01:28.451 --> 01:01:30.419
Oh, my god.
It's really bad.

01:01:43.132 --> 01:01:44.466
What's that?

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:48.036
It's not stopping.

01:01:52.975 --> 01:01:55.177
Aaron.

01:01:58.247 --> 01:02:00.182
Oh, my god.

01:02:00.184 --> 01:02:01.383
Aaron, it's really
bad this time.

01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:03.819
It's not stopping.

01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:07.889
Aaron.

01:02:10.226 --> 01:02:12.861
All right, I'm gonna
get him out of here.

01:02:34.016 --> 01:02:36.051
Hey! It's about time.

01:02:36.053 --> 01:02:37.085
Usually I'm the one
running late.

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:39.354
I was just about to call you.

01:02:39.356 --> 01:02:42.457
Yeah, I'm sorry. I've been
working on this assignment

01:02:42.459 --> 01:02:45.861
and it's just really, um...

01:02:45.863 --> 01:02:49.297
Anybody interesting?

01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:51.967
Hey! I think
i just made a joke.

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:55.170
It's not that. I--

01:02:55.172 --> 01:03:00.175
I talked to the ghost hunter.
And now just--

01:03:00.177 --> 01:03:04.079
things are just really
getting out of control.

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:07.883
Are you okay?

01:03:08.818 --> 01:03:10.385
Hey.

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:21.163
I think I've gotten myself
into something very dark.

01:03:21.165 --> 01:03:22.531
And for the first time
in my life,

01:03:22.533 --> 01:03:26.067
I'm actually scared
of what might happen.

01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:29.905
Okay. I've never heard
you talk like this before,

01:03:29.907 --> 01:03:32.140
like, ever.

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:35.143
I think you need to stop,
like, right now.

01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:39.381
I don't think
i can stop now.

01:03:39.383 --> 01:03:41.917
What do you mean?

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:44.452
I've already
opened the door.

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:49.024
...dark, dark...

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:54.863
Okay, you're scaring me
right now.

01:03:54.865 --> 01:03:57.132
Jessica! Hey! Jessica!

01:05:01.431 --> 01:05:04.099
That sounded like him.

01:05:04.101 --> 01:05:05.433
I'm going back.

01:05:05.435 --> 01:05:06.968
-I'm going with you.
-No, you're not.

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:08.904
You'll bleed out
by the time we get there.

01:05:08.906 --> 01:05:13.575
Go to the car. If I'm not out
in 10 minutes, call the cops.

01:05:13.577 --> 01:05:15.577
Go, Justin! Just go!

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:49.010
Aaron!

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:35.657
Aaron, you gotta help me!

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:44.232
-My notes.
-Aaron!

01:07:41.824 --> 01:07:43.825
It's happening to you,
isn't it?

01:07:43.827 --> 01:07:46.561
Justin, what are you--
what are you doing here?

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:49.164
You didn't believe me.
You thought I was crazy.

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:53.735
You know what I mean now.

01:07:57.406 --> 01:08:00.108
I was just looking around

01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:01.810
trying to figure out
what happened here.

01:08:01.812 --> 01:08:04.412
Do you live nearby
or something?

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:06.214
I can show you
what Aaron found.

01:08:09.185 --> 01:08:10.418
Okay.

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:35.477
Justin?

01:11:46.335 --> 01:11:48.803
It's so strange
that we haven't heard
a word from her.

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:50.738
I mean, nothing.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.987
The police haven't heard
anything either.

01:12:05.989 --> 01:12:07.488
No leads, no nothing.

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:09.590
--Hello. Damian?

01:12:09.592 --> 01:12:12.060
-Yes?
-I'm Richard.

01:12:12.062 --> 01:12:13.795
We spoke earlier.

01:12:13.797 --> 01:12:16.431
Oh, yeah.
Hey, thanks for coming.
I appreciate it.

01:12:16.433 --> 01:12:18.533
This is what Jessica
left behind

01:12:18.535 --> 01:12:19.834
when we last spoke.

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:21.602
I hope you find it useful.

01:12:23.505 --> 01:12:26.040
"Das volta."
Is that Latin?

01:12:26.042 --> 01:12:29.711
Yes. It means,
"if god wills it."

01:12:29.713 --> 01:12:31.412
Are you an investigator
as well?

01:12:31.414 --> 01:12:34.349
Uh, yes, and I'm also
the editor of the blog.

01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:38.553
We should speak further.
Perhaps I can help.

01:12:38.555 --> 01:12:40.722
Okay, we can go back
to my office. All right?
