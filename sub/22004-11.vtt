WEBVTT

00:10.244 --> 00:12.713
What do we know, Mary?
Vehicle was spotted

00:12.746 --> 00:15.316
fleeing an industrial
warehouse after robbing it.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.517
It's been leading units

00:16.550 --> 00:18.119
on a high-speed chase
throughout the city.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.421
Any injuries?
No. But not for
lack of trying.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.423
27 to 531.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.792
Roadblock is in place.

00:24.825 --> 00:27.228
OFFICER :
Suspect vehicle coming your way.
Almost here! Let's go!

00:46.314 --> 00:47.415
ESTES:
Here they come.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.050
Steady.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.386
Steady.

00:57.325 --> 01:00.794
Driver, turn off your ignition.
Place both hands,

01:00.828 --> 01:02.363
palms out, on
the windshield.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.697
You are completely
surrounded

01:03.731 --> 01:05.366
Comply with
our instructions,

01:05.399 --> 01:07.401
or we will take you by force.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.572
All right, move in.
Move in.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.241
OFFICER:
The driver's moving!

01:13.274 --> 01:14.808
OFFICER 2:
We got movement
in the back!

01:14.842 --> 01:16.510
ESTES:
Down, everyone, down!

01:34.428 --> 01:37.498
:
What the hell was that, Mary?

01:37.531 --> 01:38.699
Mary.

01:38.732 --> 01:41.135
Mary. Oh...

01:41.902 --> 01:44.205
Officer down!

01:44.238 --> 01:45.506
Look, stay with me.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.375
It's gonna be okay.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.377
Stay with me.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.544
I need an ambulance!

01:50.578 --> 01:53.281
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:53.314 --> 01:55.749
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:55.783 --> 01:58.319
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:58.352 --> 01:59.387
* How, how, how, how

01:59.420 --> 02:01.489
* Hey, hey

02:07.695 --> 02:09.363
* You gotta come on.

02:12.733 --> 02:13.801
Hey.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.803
Even on a Sunday morning off,

02:15.836 --> 02:17.838
can't help but find
some work to do.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.740
Inventory soothes the soul,
Loretta.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.775
That's what the poet says.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.744
Though I say...

02:23.777 --> 02:26.447
turnovers from Brocato's
are a close second.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.817
What gives?

02:29.850 --> 02:31.652
Now, don't be dubious.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.888
I'm just checking on my friend
after the holidays.
Well,

02:34.922 --> 02:36.790
work's been slow,
but the bar's been poppin'.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.492
I know you were busy
with the boys,

02:38.526 --> 02:40.428
but you should've seen it
on New Year's Eve.

02:40.461 --> 02:44.832
Laurel came. She says
to tell you hello.
Okay.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.800
Ah, for a good investigator,

02:46.834 --> 02:49.237
sometimes you're
so dense, Dwayne.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.638
What I mean is...

02:50.671 --> 02:52.640
What you mean is, after
all the drama last year,

02:52.673 --> 02:55.409
with HQ probing my performance,
the Hamilton situation...

02:55.443 --> 02:56.977
Yeah. And your team
doubting you.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.480
...my team doubting me--
how am I holding up?

02:59.513 --> 03:00.614
Yes.

03:01.649 --> 03:02.850
HQ's off my case.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.418
Team's working well.

03:04.452 --> 03:05.786
My demons are at bay.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.588
All is right with the world.

03:07.621 --> 03:10.324
No more drama,
for the time being.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.926
All right, let's eat.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.496
If you insist.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.931
Oh, my goodness.

03:18.932 --> 03:21.369
Hey, Christopher. What's up?

03:24.705 --> 03:26.907
How many injured?

03:30.311 --> 03:32.280
ESTES:
Well, I need to know
as soon as you.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.981
Estes.
You understand?

03:34.014 --> 03:35.816
Go. Go. Yeah. Let's go.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.451
What the hell?

03:37.485 --> 03:38.819
You all right?
Huh?

03:38.852 --> 03:40.888
Yeah, yeah.
No, no, no, this, uh...

03:40.921 --> 03:42.690
this isn't my blood.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.558
Uh, one of my officers,
Mary Crane,

03:44.592 --> 03:46.994
she, uh, she got hurt,
along with a few others.

03:47.027 --> 03:49.563
Uh, Officer Courtney
and Sergeant Tim, uh...

03:49.597 --> 03:51.732
Tim-- God, what the hell's
his last name? I...

03:51.765 --> 03:53.967
Carl, Carl, hey,
hey, hey, slow down.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.936
Yeah, just, it was
a high-speed chase.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.805
Son of a bitches,
they-they robbed...

03:57.838 --> 03:59.807
armed robbery
at an electronics warehouse,

03:59.840 --> 04:01.309
got a few thousand dollars
in cash

04:01.342 --> 04:02.443
and some computer components.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.011
Suspects had a machine gun?

04:04.044 --> 04:05.879
M134 minigun.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.716
Pride, it was like...
it was like Fallujah out here.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.951
I-I, uh...
They fled the scene?
Any idea where they went?

04:10.984 --> 04:12.653
No, no, no.
They, uh...

04:12.686 --> 04:14.988
We got every officer in town
on a manhunt right now.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.890
Okay, NCIS is ready to help.
Good.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.527
Now, you said one
of the suspects was Navy?
Yeah, yeah.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.996
Used to be. We pulled some
fingerprints from the warehouse.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.833
PRIDE: Marcus Tyrell.
Navy logistics specialist.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.701
Dishonorably discharged...

04:27.735 --> 04:30.838
for stealing military equipment.
Yeah, we don't have an ID

04:30.871 --> 04:33.974
on the other suspect yet, but
we've got surveillance photos.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.543
How'd they end up
with a minigun?

04:35.576 --> 04:37.010
SEBASTIAN:
Well, from us, actually.

04:37.044 --> 04:39.513
I just ran a ballistics field
test on the spent cartridges.

04:39.547 --> 04:42.650
Both gun and ammunition
are Navy issue, King.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.653
All right, look,
we'll dig into Tyrell...

04:45.686 --> 04:48.956
figure out who he's with
and where they've gone.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.724
Yeah, good. I-I need
to get over to Mercy,

04:50.758 --> 04:52.426
check on my officers
right now.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.861
Oh, hey, I'm a universal donor,
so if they need blood,

04:53.894 --> 04:55.596
you know, I'm not the best
with needles,

04:55.629 --> 04:57.831
but once they get it in,
they can pump all day.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.733
You know what I need?

04:59.767 --> 05:01.969
I need you to find these guys.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.837
PRIDE:
Okay.
All right?

05:03.871 --> 05:06.073
Guaranteed, Carl.
Guaranteed.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.984
Petty Officer Marcus Tyrell
was caught selling pistols

05:17.017 --> 05:19.987
from the armory on his ship
to undercover cops in Virginia.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.922
Did two years in the brig,
got discharged.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.925
The machine gun they used today
was part of a cache

05:24.958 --> 05:26.927
of decommissioned Navy weapons
that went missing

05:26.960 --> 05:29.530
from the Blue Grass Army Depot
a few weeks ago.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.999
Thousands of small arms and
ammunition just disappeared.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.434
No evidence left behind.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.002
Whoever pulled off
the heist was good.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.004
Can't be Tyrell-- his rap
sheet's a study in stupidity.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.972
He's small-time.
Yeah, it could be

05:39.006 --> 05:41.008
our second suspect
was responsible.
There's got to be more.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.844
You don't just waltz onto a base
and steal an arsenal

05:43.877 --> 05:45.078
without leaving a trace.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.681
Got an idea who
masterminded the heist.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.784
Willard Kurtz.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.019
LASALLE:
Who is Willard Kurtz?

05:52.052 --> 05:53.654
SONJA:
Gunrunner out of Houston.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.922
Smuggled handguns
into Mexico.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.625
Know the name
from my ATF days.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.460
What connects him
to the Blue Grass robbery?

05:59.493 --> 06:00.661
He's done it before.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.963
National Guard
armory in Texas,

06:02.996 --> 06:04.865
gun manufacture
clearing house in Arizona.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.467
Always high-end,
military-grade weapons

06:06.500 --> 06:08.436
and always in bulk.

06:08.469 --> 06:11.104
Which makes him very popular
on the international market

06:11.138 --> 06:12.806
and number one
on the ATF's most wanted list.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.443
Kurtz was spotted
in Kentucky

06:15.476 --> 06:17.010
about three days
before the Blue Grass robbery

06:17.044 --> 06:18.812
with two unknown men.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.113
That's Tyrell and his partner.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.416
Hey. Kurtz could be here
in New Orleans.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.652
Which means we have a chance
to take him down.

06:24.685 --> 06:27.120
If we can find him.
Oh, Patton and I
can help with that.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.590
So, we've been running photos
from the police chase,

06:29.623 --> 06:31.992
trying to get facial recognition
on the second suspect.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.194
We got a good image from
traffic cam, but no hits yet.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.763
We did, however, find something

06:35.796 --> 06:37.565
that might help us trace
that pickup truck.

06:37.598 --> 06:38.966
Well, NOPD already
found the truck

06:38.999 --> 06:40.768
abandoned a mile away
from the shootout.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.437
We don't need the truck if we
can tell you where it came from.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.105
That decal on the
driver's side.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.608
PRIDE:
Some kind of bar code?

06:47.641 --> 06:48.542
Yeah, it allows the truck
to access

06:48.576 --> 06:50.110
a restricted area;
we were able to scan it.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.979
Where does it lead to?
Port of New Orleans.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.915
Got a PIN number
and everything.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.017
Good work
Let's check it out.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.686
SEBASTIAN:
All right.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.954
*

07:00.988 --> 07:03.691
According to port records,
the pickup truck is connected

07:03.724 --> 07:06.059
to Whitehall Freight.
I've heard that name before.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.595
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, they're
a small shipping company

07:07.628 --> 07:10.130
with one cargo vessel--
can't be a coincidence.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.533
They're planning
to head south tonight.

07:12.566 --> 07:13.667
Trying to skip town.
GREGORIO: If that's the case,

07:13.701 --> 07:15.503
Tyrell can't be
too far away.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.470
Hey, we'll stop him.

07:16.504 --> 07:17.671
PRIDE: Yeah, those suspects
have already shot

07:17.705 --> 07:20.073
four cops-- they're not afraid
to engage law enforcement.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.109
We need to keep it tight here.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.076
Go with Sonja.
Okay.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.745
Chris.
LASALLE:
Right.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.047
*

07:43.063 --> 07:44.197
Got a visual on Tyrell.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.033
Heading east
through the containers.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.001
LASALLE:
Copy that, King. On our way.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.782
Marcus Tyrell!

08:01.815 --> 08:03.884
Federal agents!
Come out with your hands up!

08:05.919 --> 08:08.255
SEBASTIAN: He's armed!
LASALLE: Drop the weapon now!

08:10.658 --> 08:12.626
He's down.
Who shot him?

08:12.660 --> 08:14.261
MAN:
It's all right.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.063
Coming out.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.531
SEBASTIAN:
Oh, my God.

08:17.565 --> 08:18.599
Is that...
Kurtz.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.234
Put the weapon down,

08:21.268 --> 08:22.570
or we will shoot.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.638
Okay. Okay, stay calm.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.940
Slow.
I'm complying.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.110
KURTZ: It's all
right, gentlemen.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.945
I'm on your side.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.629
Surprisingly calm
for someone about to be charged

08:48.662 --> 08:51.198
with international
weapons smuggling and murder.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.670
Makes you think twice,
doesn't it?

08:56.704 --> 08:58.038
No.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.007
We see shipping
containers

09:00.040 --> 09:04.011
filled with stolen
Navy small arms.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.879
One of those weapons
was missing,

09:05.913 --> 09:09.082
and it was used to injure
four police officers.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.150
We both know Marcus Tyrell

09:10.183 --> 09:11.885
pulled the trigger
on those cops.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.854
And you pulled
the trigger on him.
Saving you

09:13.887 --> 09:15.589
and your
agents' lives.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.124
You're welcome,
by the way.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.092
Why'd you shoot Tyrell?
Like I said,

09:19.126 --> 09:20.694
I'm one of the good guys.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.095
I'm working for
the government.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.097
You're the most wanted
arms dealer

09:24.131 --> 09:25.933
in the southern hemisphere.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.635
Selling to drug cartels
and militias and...

09:27.668 --> 09:29.269
KURTZ:
Smoke and mirrors.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.138
All part of
the mission.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.205
What exactly is the "mission"?

09:32.239 --> 09:33.607
I've already said too much.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.142
That's not how this works.

09:35.175 --> 09:38.211
You're gonna tell me
how you stole weapons

09:38.245 --> 09:39.713
from the Blue Grass Depot,

09:39.747 --> 09:42.382
why Tyrell was robbing
an electronics warehouse,

09:42.415 --> 09:46.286
and you're gonna ID the man
who helped him shoot those cops.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.888
I would...

09:47.921 --> 09:49.256
but...

09:49.289 --> 09:51.925
I'm afraid it's all classified.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.262
It's way above
your clearance level.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.305
I've heard a lot of criminals
spin a lot of BS,

10:05.338 --> 10:07.407
but nothing
at this level.
It's not all BS.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.811
Told you I recognize the
name Whitehall Freight.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.212
Yeah, shipping company

10:12.245 --> 10:13.914
that Kurtz was using
to smuggle weapons.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.249
I used Whitehall, too,
when I was undercover.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.751
ATF sting operation.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.286
You saying
he's telling the truth?

10:19.319 --> 10:20.387
No, I'm saying
it's similar

10:20.420 --> 10:22.255
to the MO we used
on that case.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.658
Look, I reached out
to an old friend at ATF,

10:24.692 --> 10:26.093
runs undercover ops.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.227
He's in New
Orleans now.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.229
Could connect to Kurtz.
Okay, go.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.331
See if Kurtz's story
holds water.

10:31.364 --> 10:32.833
Uh, what are you gonna do?

10:32.866 --> 10:34.267
I'm going back
into interrogation.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.669
Alone?

10:35.703 --> 10:37.270
I mean, are
you sure

10:37.304 --> 10:39.840
that's a good idea?
Why wouldn't it be?

10:39.873 --> 10:42.142
Well, you're upset
about the shooting.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.845
Aren't we all?
Yes, but...

10:44.878 --> 10:47.848
you know how you get
when a case becomes personal.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.783
There's a lot of
tunnel vision,

10:49.817 --> 10:51.018
rule breaking...
It's my job

10:51.051 --> 10:52.285
to talk to Kurtz.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.355
It's your job to trust me
to do it right.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.792
Grab Gregorio.

11:04.331 --> 11:07.034
Pride says he's got it under
control, take his word for it.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.335
Nope, you didn't
see the attitude

11:08.368 --> 11:10.337
coming off Kurtz
in interrogation.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.440
Cop's life on the line, it'd set
any one of us on the edge.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.275
You don't think Pride saw that?

11:15.308 --> 11:19.212
I just... I want him to ask
for help from time to time.

11:19.246 --> 11:22.315
We are helping. By talking
to this ATF contact.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.451
Where is he, anyway?

11:24.484 --> 11:26.286
MAN:
Bonnie!

11:26.319 --> 11:29.790
Hey, Clyde.

11:29.823 --> 11:33.260
Hey. Ooh.
Hey.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.162
This is Jake Roman.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.730
Tammy Gregori... Yeah.
Yeah, Gregorio, right?

11:36.764 --> 11:38.331
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah? Former FBI.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.900
Complicated love life.
Sonja told me everything.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.302
Not everything.
That's nice.

11:42.335 --> 11:45.272
Don't listen to him.
Oh, come on, come on. We were
partners for three years.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.307
We confide in each other.
Well, you didn't confide

11:47.340 --> 11:49.209
that you were
working in New Orleans.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.310
I couldn't tell anyone.

11:50.343 --> 11:51.945
I'm not anyone.
Look, I know.

11:51.979 --> 11:53.346
It's sensitive, all right?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.482
Sensitive because
of Willard Kurtz?

11:55.515 --> 11:58.085
An unrelated case.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.087
You know him, though, right?
I know of him.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.755
He's an arms dealer.
Uh-huh.

12:01.789 --> 12:04.224
No. You arrested him
back in the day.

12:04.257 --> 12:07.194
That was a long time ago.
He's saying he's working
for the government.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.830
Using Whitehall Freight
to move guns--

12:09.863 --> 12:11.832
That's an ATF front.

12:11.865 --> 12:14.234
I wish I could tell you more.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.335
You're hiding something.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.037
Now, what would make
you say that?

12:17.070 --> 12:18.338
First of all, you've been
sitting here a while

12:18.371 --> 12:20.007
and you haven't
touched your food.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.942
Secondly, you keep
looking at that woman

12:21.975 --> 12:22.943
sitting by
the window,

12:22.976 --> 12:24.277
and not
in a flirty way.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.213
Jake.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.782
I got to get back to work.
Come on.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.183
We need to know what you know.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.218
Like I said, nothing.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.421
We'll catch up soon.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.392
That was interesting.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.394
Why, 'cause he lied to my face?

12:41.428 --> 12:43.563
No, 'cause he couldn't
keep his hands off you.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.066
Girl, we are just friends.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.567
No,are just friends.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.036
That was something else.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.904
Hey, stay on point...
What?

12:50.938 --> 12:52.372
'cause the woman you noticed
is gone now, too.
Oh...

12:59.913 --> 13:02.315
You're Pride. I'm Sutter.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.985
How can I help you?
Well, you can
lead me to Willard Kurtz.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.286
I'm taking custody now.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.321
You don't look like ATF.

13:08.355 --> 13:09.422
I'm not.

13:09.456 --> 13:12.192
I'm CIA.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.227
And you haven't
gotten the call yet. Wow.

13:14.261 --> 13:17.164
The, uh, wheels of bureaucracy
are ridiculously slow.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.066
True enough.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.168
But there's no way I'm
releasing Kurtz to you.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.303
You misunderstand.
I'm not asking.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.972
I absolutely understand.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.373
I'm not budging.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.408
Kurtz stole Navy weapons

13:28.441 --> 13:30.377
and used 'em on cops.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.879
Bottom line here is,

13:31.912 --> 13:34.982
I don't know who
you are, Ms. Sutter.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.984
And I don't have time
to find out.

13:37.017 --> 13:40.053
There was no
Blue Grass Depot robbery.

13:40.087 --> 13:41.488
It was staged.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.356
A ploy designed
to help an operation

13:43.390 --> 13:44.992
code-named Colossus.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.861
You guys.
What's Colossus?

13:47.895 --> 13:49.863
Originally an ATF sting

13:49.897 --> 13:52.165
using Kurtz
to sell weapons to criminals.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.401
Very successful,
if small in scope.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.937
And how does CIA play into it?
I knew if we

13:56.970 --> 14:00.073
gave Kurtz better access
to weapons,

14:00.107 --> 14:01.909
more inventory...

14:01.942 --> 14:03.310
we could catch bigger bad guys.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.978
Foreign extremist types.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.647
So you're letting a known felon
sell military small arms

14:07.680 --> 14:09.449
to terrorists?
That is...

14:09.482 --> 14:11.418
It's ambitious, I know.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.486
I was gonna say dangerous.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.655
It's got Dwayne Pride
written all over it.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.025
Rewriting the rule book.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.493
I've done my
research on you.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.930
Not sure what research
you did on me.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.431
But you got it wrong.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.499
I just sat with Kurtz
for the last few hours,

14:26.533 --> 14:28.301
and I can tell you
he cannot be trusted.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.137
I'm not working on trust.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.472
I'm monitoring every sale
Kurtz has made.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.641
Guns are under my control.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.343
Money's under my control.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.011
How do you control Kurtz?

14:38.045 --> 14:39.312
Let's just say I have leverage.

14:39.346 --> 14:40.948
Well, your
leverage failed.

14:40.981 --> 14:43.216
Kurtz's men
robbed a warehouse,

14:43.250 --> 14:45.385
got into a
gunfight with NOPD.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.120
One of the suspects
is still at large.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.122
Kurtz hired those men
on his own.

14:49.156 --> 14:52.159
They have no idea they were
part of a covert operation.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.593
Doesn't make me feel better.

14:53.626 --> 14:56.063
I know. Look,
I'll personally talk to Kurtz.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.565
I'll get a name
to go with your second suspect

14:58.598 --> 15:00.533
to help you with NOPD.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.402
But I really do need
to take him now.

15:02.435 --> 15:03.570
He's shipping out tonight.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.039
Well, those guns are staying

15:06.073 --> 15:08.408
exactly where they are
and so is Kurtz.

15:08.441 --> 15:11.378
Mmm. I'm not arguing here.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.712
The decision's
already been made,

15:12.745 --> 15:15.282
way above
our pay grade.

15:15.315 --> 15:16.716
You just don't know it yet.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.587
That'll be
your bosses.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.589
Go ahead and answer it.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.124
They're about to
tell you that Kurtz

15:24.157 --> 15:25.458
and those weapons
are mine.

15:31.464 --> 15:35.135
Well, I've sorted through
all the 7.62 ammo so far.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.703
Got enough samples to
take back for analysis.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.972
The bullets that hit those cops
came from these containers,

15:39.006 --> 15:40.540
I'll find a match.

15:40.573 --> 15:43.510
Yeah, there's enough guns here
to equip a small army.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.312
There's one more container
over here.

15:50.383 --> 15:51.584
I think
it's broken.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.487
I'm gonna lend you a hand.

15:54.521 --> 15:57.424
I totally knew that.
Yeah.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.026
Scary to think about
the contraband

15:59.059 --> 16:01.261
that goes through the port
on a daily basis.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.997
Guns, drugs,
people, bombs.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.199
We just found
something scarier.
Is that a...

16:06.233 --> 16:07.534
Predator drone.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.602
With Hellfire
missiles

16:09.636 --> 16:12.272
ROMAN:
I'm gonna ask you to move away
from the containers now, please.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.573
And you are?

16:13.606 --> 16:15.442
Special Agent Roman.
ATF.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.344
Oh, it's all right, we're...
ROMAN: NCIS. I know.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.612
You're no longer authorized
to be on these premises.

16:19.646 --> 16:20.547
According to who?

16:20.580 --> 16:22.415
DoD, DOJ, CIA.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.550
You get the point.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.085
Call your boss.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.453
He already knows.

16:28.255 --> 16:29.589
I got to go.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.092
You gave him a drone.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.394
These weapons are
being bought by ISIS.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.663
They can get rifles anywhere,
but a Predator drone...

16:36.696 --> 16:39.066
They're gonna
use 'em against us.
Don't worry.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.534
The navigation system's
completely deactivated.

16:41.568 --> 16:42.602
Yeah, just a giant Tonka toy.

16:42.635 --> 16:43.670
You're making a mistake.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.305
James Smith.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.673
That's the name
of your second suspect.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.541
He was Marcus Tyrell's friend.

16:48.575 --> 16:51.211
Kurtz doesn't know where he
went or where he came from.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.280
But you're free to arrest
him if you'd like.

17:00.487 --> 17:01.788
Wait.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.690
Was that the gun smuggler
you texted me about?

17:03.723 --> 17:04.757
Why's he leaving? Hey!

17:04.791 --> 17:07.527
Hey...
Carl. Hold on. Listen.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.129
I'll tell you everything.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.164
I wish it was better news.

17:12.432 --> 17:13.600
We're off the case.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.768
No. No.
We cannot stand down now.

17:15.802 --> 17:18.171
Those men are murderers.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.340
What are you talking about?
Officer Crane...

17:22.409 --> 17:24.043
She's dead.

17:37.257 --> 17:40.527
LASALLE: Four police officers
were shot. One dead.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.495
And our suspects
work for Willard Kurtz,

17:42.529 --> 17:45.232
gunrunner who's part of
a covert CIA operation

17:45.265 --> 17:46.199
called Colossus.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.268
What else do we know
about our two suspects?

17:48.301 --> 17:49.769
They were robbing
an electronics warehouse,

17:49.802 --> 17:52.605
got away with some computer
components. Not sure why.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.774
And Kurtz killed one of his
partners in front of us,

17:54.807 --> 17:55.842
and we also
don't know why.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.544
And according to the CIA,

17:57.577 --> 17:59.846
the other suspect's name
is, uh, James Smith.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.514
Yeah, and there's only
about 47,000

18:01.548 --> 18:03.183
James Smiths
in the United States.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.584
I haven't been able
to connect any of them

18:04.617 --> 18:06.586
to Kurtz
or Tyrell yet.
ESTES: All right, we need

18:06.619 --> 18:08.188
to talk to Kurtz,
get to the bottom of this.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.389
They're about
to leave the country

18:09.422 --> 18:10.657
with cargo containers full of

18:10.690 --> 18:13.226
military small arms
and a Predator drone.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.461
I'm gonna get Kurtz to spill.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.629
No, hold on, Estes.
Think a moment.

18:16.663 --> 18:17.697
I haven't got a moment,
all right?

18:17.730 --> 18:19.132
He's leaving on that ship.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.533
No, he's not.

18:20.567 --> 18:21.801
Just spoke to Jake at ATF.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.370
He's doing me a solid.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.538
He got CIA to hold off
on the operation

18:25.572 --> 18:26.873
until we find James Smith.

18:26.906 --> 18:29.609
And you believe it?
Absolutely. We were partners.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.644
Guys, look, if we stand down,

18:31.678 --> 18:33.780
we will get
all the answers.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.782
From the CIA?
Are you kidding?

18:35.815 --> 18:37.350
They're the ones
that put the machine guns

18:37.384 --> 18:38.485
in the killers' hands.
I'm sorry,

18:38.518 --> 18:40.187
but we don't have
any new evidence

18:40.220 --> 18:42.489
to act on anyway.
SEBASTIAN:
Well, a-actually, we do.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.224
I mean, we got the ammunition
samples we got

18:44.257 --> 18:45.492
from the cargo containers.
You know, we match

18:45.525 --> 18:47.560
any of them to the slugs
that we pulled from

18:47.594 --> 18:49.629
the crime scene, and we got
a direct connection to Kurtz.

18:49.662 --> 18:50.797
LASALLE: And Patton's
doing his digital

18:50.830 --> 18:52.532
deep dive as we speak.
Plus, we got

18:52.565 --> 18:54.267
Tyrell's body at autopsy.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.568
Yeah, might be some
sort of trace there.

18:55.602 --> 18:56.636
SONJA: Okay.
Hold up, guys.

18:56.669 --> 18:59.939
See, we're no longer
on this case.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.474
HQ made it clear.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.876
Sonja's right.

19:03.910 --> 19:04.944
We've been told
in no uncertain terms

19:04.977 --> 19:08.615
to leave Kurtz alone. However,

19:08.648 --> 19:10.917
we can investigate
his partners.
Wait, what?

19:10.950 --> 19:12.952
No.
GREGORIO:
He's right, Sonja.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.422
CIA said neither of these guys
work for the government.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.756
PRIDE: Right.
We stay in our own lane.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.191
Process the evidence
from the shooting.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.559
Trace it back to James Smith.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.893
Go.
Go.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.495
NOPD still has
the suspect's truck.

19:22.529 --> 19:23.896
I'll have it transferred
to your lab.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.599
You guys can search it
for microscopic whatevers.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.435
Uh, got extra manpower too.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.837
Every cop in the city's
at our disposal.
Thank you, Carl.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.872
Yeah.
I talk to you?

19:35.708 --> 19:37.944
SONJA:
You see what's happening here?

19:37.977 --> 19:40.947
You're setting
us up, again,

19:40.980 --> 19:42.749
to go off book.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.284
We're following protocol.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.353
Investigating the murder
of a cop.

19:46.386 --> 19:49.622
It's a fine line to walk...
It's an impossible line to walk.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.624
Look, you're
following protocol now,

19:51.658 --> 19:54.694
but the moment that
changes-- and it will--

19:54.727 --> 19:56.863
it won't just be
your career in trouble.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.931
You're worried
about your friend.
Someone should be.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.768
You know, he put his neck
out there for us.
And I appreciate it.

20:01.801 --> 20:05.372
But CIA doesn't care about
getting justice for those cops,

20:05.405 --> 20:06.706
so we're gonna.

20:06.739 --> 20:07.807
No matter the cost?

20:08.841 --> 20:10.710
I get it, Sonja.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.645
I wouldn't ask anyone
to be involved

20:12.679 --> 20:14.247
if it doesn't feel right.

20:14.281 --> 20:15.715
You should go home.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.917
We'll let you know
if we find anything.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.820
Okay.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.596
Hey.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.264
Thank you so much
for coming over.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.500
I know you got your hands
full with the operation.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.635
Nah, it's cool.
Everything's on hold anyway

20:35.668 --> 20:37.437
until Sutter
gets Kurtz to give up

20:37.470 --> 20:39.038
more info on James Smith.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.040
So I got some downtime.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.710
Yeah, well,
just so you know,

20:43.743 --> 20:46.679
NCIS and NOPD
are moving forward

20:46.713 --> 20:48.348
with their investigation.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.683
I tried to tell 'em it
would jam you up, but...

20:50.717 --> 20:52.985
Look, they lost one of their own
today. I get it.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.655
It'd be a relief if Sutter just
had me removed from the case.

20:55.688 --> 20:56.923
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.726
This could be
a career-maker, Jake.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.795
You wrap up an ISIS network?
Yeah.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.797
That's what I've been told
for the last two years.

21:04.831 --> 21:08.301
But all I see us doing is
selling weapons to the bad guys

21:08.335 --> 21:11.638
while I play caretaker
to that scumbag Kurtz.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.806
I guess we're both
at the mercy of the bosses, huh?

21:13.840 --> 21:16.809
Mmm, no.
Pride's not like that.

21:16.843 --> 21:18.711
No, he's an incredible teacher.

21:18.745 --> 21:21.914
We just can't
follow him blindly anymore.

21:21.948 --> 21:24.784
You've been with NCIS
for, what, three years?

21:24.817 --> 21:27.854
That's about your shelf life,
Bonnie. You start to get antsy.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.789
No, I don't.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.924
Ah, come on,
we were kicking ass together

21:31.958 --> 21:33.960
for exactly three years.
We made a hell of a team.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.795
And then, all of a sudden,

21:35.828 --> 21:37.730
you take a deep cover
assignment which lasted...

21:37.764 --> 21:41.334
Three years.
Right. And then
you joined NCIS.

21:41.368 --> 21:43.703
If I wanted to be profiled,

21:43.736 --> 21:45.705
I'd get my roommate do it.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.940
She's a professional.
Yeah, okay. So...

21:47.974 --> 21:50.677
what do you want?

21:50.710 --> 21:52.745
*

21:52.779 --> 21:56.749
* Drown me in your river

21:56.783 --> 22:00.420
* Sacrifice me on the mountain

22:00.453 --> 22:05.057
* 'Cause all I need
is your lovin' *

22:05.091 --> 22:07.794
* And I'm all right, all right

22:07.827 --> 22:08.895
* All right

22:08.928 --> 22:13.733
* Drown me in your river

22:13.766 --> 22:16.135
* Sacrifice me on the mountain

22:17.937 --> 22:20.740
* 'Cause all I need
is your lovin'. *

22:22.475 --> 22:24.076
We're going rogue again,
is that it?

22:24.110 --> 22:25.845
We are not.

22:25.878 --> 22:28.881
You want to examine
the results of an autopsy

22:28.915 --> 22:31.418
for a case you've
been told not to pursue.

22:31.451 --> 22:33.786
We're only focused on finding
our other murder suspect.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.588
Tyrell's autopsy
could help us.

22:35.622 --> 22:37.590
And it keeps us out
of the CIA's hair.

22:37.624 --> 22:39.792
They've already taken custody
of his body.

22:39.826 --> 22:43.095
I could let you peek
at my files. On the DL.

22:43.129 --> 22:45.097
Uh, we're gonna need
the room here,

22:45.131 --> 22:46.833
if you don't mind clearing out.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.135
Nope, nope. No
need to clear out.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.770
You're okay.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.839
No need to go on the DL.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.774
We're following
procedure,

22:54.807 --> 22:56.876
helping NOPD track
a cop killer.

22:56.909 --> 22:59.879
And what if the clues you find
lead you right to Willard Kurtz,

22:59.912 --> 23:01.881
the man you've been told
to leave alone?

23:01.914 --> 23:04.584
I'll call HQ,
lay out the evidence,

23:04.617 --> 23:06.819
let them decide how to proceed.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.423
Very enlightened of you.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.159
I'm still clearing the room.

23:13.192 --> 23:14.427
Uh...

23:14.461 --> 23:16.463
thank you!
TECH: Yes, ma'am.

23:16.496 --> 23:18.164
This is just to be safe.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.168
LASALLE:
I'm guessin' this means

23:22.201 --> 23:24.471
you found something.
A foreign substance

23:24.504 --> 23:26.906
on Tyrell's hands,
boots, and clothing.

23:26.939 --> 23:28.941
It's concentrated sucrose.
A lot of it.

23:28.975 --> 23:30.843
You thinking he was
in a sugar cane field?

23:30.877 --> 23:32.178
Could be a hideout.

23:32.211 --> 23:33.946
There's a lot of sugar cane
in South Louisiana.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.582
I'll call Sebastian.

23:35.615 --> 23:36.883
See if he can't
narrow it down.

23:36.916 --> 23:37.884
Thanks, Loretta.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.953
Hey. I know

23:40.987 --> 23:43.590
Dwayne means it when he says
he's gonna stay on course.

23:43.623 --> 23:45.625
But you really believe he can?

23:45.658 --> 23:47.960
Well, I got his back
no matter what he does.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.929
But don't think
I can say the same

23:49.962 --> 23:52.565
for everyone
on the team this time.

24:03.710 --> 24:06.513
Don't give me that judgy look,
girl.

24:06.546 --> 24:08.815
I've known him longer
than I've known you,

24:08.848 --> 24:11.651
dog.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.185
Hey.
Hey.

24:13.219 --> 24:14.821
What are you doing?

24:14.854 --> 24:18.157
Oh, nothing.
Just throwing out that swill

24:18.190 --> 24:20.760
you brought.

24:23.563 --> 24:26.833
So, how's about...

24:26.866 --> 24:29.702
I get us

24:29.736 --> 24:31.704
an actual bottle of wine.

24:31.738 --> 24:33.673
See, this here is a Cabernet.

24:33.706 --> 24:35.875
Yes. I'm gonna need you
to make yourself useful.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.744
Yeah.
Open it up.

24:37.777 --> 24:38.978
It needs to breathe.
Okay.

24:39.011 --> 24:40.947
Over there.
Look how fancy

24:40.980 --> 24:43.883
you got, Bonnie.
Drinkin' cork top wine.

24:43.916 --> 24:46.853
Oh, and I don't drink
can beer anymore either.

24:46.886 --> 24:49.088
JAKE: All right,
all right.

24:49.121 --> 24:51.891
Okay, okay. Puttin' on airs
like royalty, huh?

24:51.924 --> 24:53.960
Yeah.

24:58.264 --> 25:00.633
Oh, man.

25:00.667 --> 25:03.102
Is everything okay?

25:03.135 --> 25:05.972
Yeah. Look, uh, you're gonna
have to save that

25:06.005 --> 25:07.006
for next time, all right?

25:08.274 --> 25:09.842
I got to roll.
Okay.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.811
All right. Okay.

25:20.052 --> 25:22.254
What have we learned
about James Smith?

25:22.288 --> 25:24.256
Not a freakin' thing.
His name doesn't show up

25:24.290 --> 25:27.259
in either Marcus Tyrell
or Willard Kurtz's past.

25:27.293 --> 25:28.961
SEBASTIAN: Yeah. Not
in the military or
criminal databases either.

25:28.995 --> 25:30.863
Could be an alias.

25:30.897 --> 25:32.031
What about
the sugar cane evidence?

25:32.064 --> 25:34.000
Could lead
to where Smith is hiding.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.101
Right. Well,
all I can tell you about that

25:35.134 --> 25:36.168
is that the sugar cane we found

25:36.202 --> 25:38.004
on Tyrell's body was rotten.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.106
Means it came from an older,
out-of-operation field.

25:40.139 --> 25:42.809
I also found similar traces
on his pickup truck.

25:42.842 --> 25:45.277
Guess we can get NOPD to search
old sugar plantations.

25:45.311 --> 25:46.913
Hold the phone.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.180
Triple P is here to
fill the empty spaces

25:48.214 --> 25:50.282
in your heart and on your case.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.652
What do you got, P?
$50,000 wire transfer

25:52.685 --> 25:54.787
to a Marcus Tyrell.

25:54.821 --> 25:57.089
Came from an offshore account
that traced back

25:57.123 --> 25:58.891
to Willard Kurtz.
GREGORIO:
Millions of dollars

25:58.925 --> 26:00.927
in that account.
Guess crime does pay.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.895
Money came from a CIA fund.

26:02.929 --> 26:03.930
How would you know that,
unless...

26:03.963 --> 26:05.031
Oh, man.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.266
Did you hack the CIA?

26:07.299 --> 26:09.636
Patton?
Don't ask if you don't
want the answer.

26:09.669 --> 26:13.072
All this cash came from
the sale of Kurtz's weapons.

26:13.105 --> 26:14.974
Sutter said she was keeping
track of the money.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.676
Yeah, well, she's
doing a lousy job.

26:16.709 --> 26:19.011
Kurtz siphoned off millions
for his offshore account.

26:19.045 --> 26:21.080
He's robbing
from the CIA

26:21.113 --> 26:22.949
He's a criminal.
No matter how much control

26:22.982 --> 26:24.684
Sutter thinks she has over him.

26:24.717 --> 26:26.118
I need to alert her now.

26:26.152 --> 26:27.153
You'll find her
at the port.

26:27.186 --> 26:28.287
And you better hurry.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.989
That cargo ship leaves tonight.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.223
Thought it was on hold.
Me, too.

26:31.257 --> 26:34.226
But Jake got a text, and all
it said was "Colossus is a go."

26:34.260 --> 26:35.027
He told you this?

26:35.061 --> 26:37.296
No, I-I took a peek
at his phone.

26:37.329 --> 26:40.032
Pride, Sutter lied to us.

26:41.968 --> 26:44.971
All right. Chris, with me.

26:49.408 --> 26:50.777
Ugh...

26:54.046 --> 26:55.181
Hey.

26:55.214 --> 26:58.017
What the hell are you doing?

26:59.018 --> 27:01.053
Exactly what you told me.

27:02.188 --> 27:03.389
The cargo ship's en route.

27:03.422 --> 27:04.724
I'll catch up,

27:04.757 --> 27:06.225
finish the deal,
get you some terrorists.

27:06.258 --> 27:09.028
I mean those two idiots
you used to rob the warehouse.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.897
Now that it's just the two
of us, tell me the truth.

27:10.930 --> 27:12.364
What were they up to?

27:12.398 --> 27:14.266
Hire crooks to run guns,

27:14.300 --> 27:16.335
don't be surprised
if they commit crime.

27:16.368 --> 27:18.337
I have put too much time
into this operation

27:18.370 --> 27:21.007
to see it fall apart because
of you and a bunch of morons.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.009
Then let me do my job.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.944
I'm coming with you.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.813
We'll both get shot in the head
if they see you at the meet.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.114
Oh, well,
you don't have a choice.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.048
I make one call
and everything

27:29.081 --> 27:32.151
you care about
gets sucked into a dark hole.

27:32.184 --> 27:33.119
Don't forget,

27:33.152 --> 27:35.087
I own you.

27:42.962 --> 27:45.164
I never forget anything.

28:16.896 --> 28:20.767
Kurtz and the cargo ship
are gone, King.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.136
Chris.

28:35.948 --> 28:37.950
Sutter.

28:39.786 --> 28:41.921
Guess Kurtz played her, too.

28:41.954 --> 28:44.123
*

28:56.903 --> 28:58.404
PRIDE:
All right, listen up.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.206
The leash is off.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.541
According to Director Vance,
since Willard Kurtz

29:02.574 --> 29:05.978
killed his CIA handler,
he is ours to pursue.

29:06.012 --> 29:07.279
Now, what do we know?

29:07.313 --> 29:09.548
He stole millions from
a government account,

29:09.581 --> 29:11.951
a cargo ship of Navy weapons
and a Predator drone.

29:11.984 --> 29:13.385
At least the drone
doesn't work.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.121
It's missing
its navigational system.

29:15.154 --> 29:16.122
SEBASTIAN:
Not for long.

29:16.155 --> 29:18.190
NOPD sent an inventory
of the components stolen

29:18.224 --> 29:19.992
from the electronics warehouse--

29:20.026 --> 29:20.893
SSDS systems,

29:20.927 --> 29:22.795
motherboards, CPUs...

29:22.829 --> 29:24.931
Everything an engineer need
to get that drone online.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.933
GREGORIO: So aside from
being a cold-blooded killer,

29:26.966 --> 29:27.934
Kurtz is an engineer, too?

29:27.967 --> 29:29.068
PATTON:
Not Kurtz.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.102
His missing partner.

29:30.136 --> 29:31.537
But thanks to this inventory,

29:31.570 --> 29:33.539
we finally ID'd James Smith.

29:33.572 --> 29:35.908
Yeah. Hugo James Smith,
actually.

29:35.942 --> 29:37.977
Worked as an electrical engineer

29:38.010 --> 29:39.979
at Axis Aeronautics, where
he programmed drones.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.814
Popped positive
for coke last year.

29:41.848 --> 29:43.282
Got fired.
Financially ruined.

29:43.315 --> 29:44.583
PATTON:
Until he received a $50,000

29:44.616 --> 29:47.486
wire transfer from Kurtz
ten days ago.

29:47.519 --> 29:50.156
If Kurtz sells an operational
drone to terrorists,

29:50.189 --> 29:52.992
there's a damn good chance it's
gonna be used against the U.S.

29:53.025 --> 29:55.261
We can't let that happen.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.997
King, Coast Guard just got
coordinates on the ship.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.832
Mustering up a
boarding team now.

29:59.866 --> 30:01.500
Okay, take Sebastian. Hitch
a ride with the Coast Guard.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.002
Secure those weapons.

30:03.035 --> 30:05.604
And get me that drone.
You got it.

30:05.637 --> 30:08.040
Sonja, can you contact
your friend Jake

30:08.074 --> 30:10.309
at ATF?
I tried. He's gone dark.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.344
Well, maybe he told you
something last night

30:12.378 --> 30:13.445
that could help us now.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.281
Sutter said she had some type
of leverage with Kurtz.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.516
Something that kept
him under control.

30:17.549 --> 30:20.119
Considering she's in autopsy
right now, I'd say

30:20.152 --> 30:21.253
Sutter is mistaken.

30:21.287 --> 30:22.354
Okay.

30:22.388 --> 30:23.322
We're all on the same team.

30:26.092 --> 30:29.528
Patton, can you trace
the GPS on Jake's phone?

30:29.561 --> 30:30.997
You know it.
SONJA: Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

30:31.030 --> 30:32.431
Let's think here.

30:32.464 --> 30:33.432
There's nothing to think about.

30:33.465 --> 30:34.533
Jake's boss
was murdered.

30:34.566 --> 30:36.135
His undercover went AWOL.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.603
He could be in danger,

30:37.636 --> 30:39.538
and he's the only one who
can fill in the blanks.

30:39.571 --> 30:41.207
We need to find him. Go.

30:42.641 --> 30:44.076
Come on.

30:50.416 --> 30:53.619
This is the place Patton traced.
412 Park Boulevard.

30:53.652 --> 30:56.388
Hey, look, when we get to
the door, let me do the talking.

30:56.422 --> 30:58.390
He might be pissed.
His operation
went pear-shaped.

30:58.424 --> 31:00.126
It's not like you're spying
on him.

31:00.159 --> 31:02.461
I spent the night with him and
snuck a peek at his phone.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.296
That's the definition
of spying.
Stop. All right,

31:04.330 --> 31:06.232
I'll grant you the blurred
lines, but he'll understand.

31:06.265 --> 31:08.267
There's a lot
at stake here.

31:11.137 --> 31:12.404
Oh! Oh!
Hey!

31:12.438 --> 31:14.073
Hey!
We're the friendlies.

31:14.106 --> 31:16.142
So much for
understanding.

31:16.175 --> 31:18.077
What are you doing here?
Look, your...

31:18.110 --> 31:19.946
operation was
compromised.

31:19.979 --> 31:22.881
And we'll explain
when you lower your weapon.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.420
What's this place?

31:28.454 --> 31:30.389
CIA safe house.
How'd you find it?

31:30.422 --> 31:32.191
Tracked the GPS
on your phone.

31:33.125 --> 31:34.927
Sorry?
Last night,

31:34.961 --> 31:38.130
I saw the text you got saying
Colossus was a go.

31:38.164 --> 31:39.465
GREGORIO: All right, relax.
She knows it sucks.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.533
She feels bad.
Let's just skip the scolding.

31:41.567 --> 31:44.503
So, look, Sutter's dead.
Kurtz killed her

31:44.536 --> 31:46.505
and took the weapons
with him.
Holy crap.

31:46.538 --> 31:48.574
Sutter said there was some kind
of leverage over Kurtz.

31:48.607 --> 31:50.242
You know what that is?

31:53.079 --> 31:55.647
It's not a "that."

31:55.681 --> 31:57.249
It's a "she."

31:57.283 --> 32:00.219
Name's Claire.
Kurtz's wife.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.325
CLAIRE: I've made
some bad choices in my life.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.227
Willard was one of 'em.

32:08.260 --> 32:11.497
I thought he'd take care of me,
but he just wanted to use me.

32:11.530 --> 32:12.598
Use you for what?

32:12.631 --> 32:14.100
I'm an accountant.

32:14.133 --> 32:15.234
I handled the money
for his deals.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.335
When we busted Kurtz
on gunrunning,

32:16.368 --> 32:18.104
Claire was keeping the books.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.705
Got charged with ten felonies.

32:19.738 --> 32:24.443
Before I stood trial,
that woman, Sutter, came to me.

32:24.476 --> 32:27.279
Said that I was
in her custody now

32:27.313 --> 32:29.348
and that I'd go
free if Willard

32:29.381 --> 32:30.582
did everything she told him.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.452
That was... two years ago.

32:33.485 --> 32:35.554
CIA detained you for two years?

32:35.587 --> 32:38.624
Moved me from safe house
to safe house under guard.

32:38.657 --> 32:41.360
No family, no friends.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.129
Just those two agents.

32:43.162 --> 32:44.496
And you knew about this?

32:44.530 --> 32:46.132
I didn't have a say.
It's not my operation.

32:46.165 --> 32:47.466
Did you see your husband
in that time?

32:47.499 --> 32:49.235
Between missions.

32:49.268 --> 32:51.303
We were given a few days
here and there.

32:51.337 --> 32:53.639
Any clue he was
trying to escape?

32:53.672 --> 32:55.241
No, because he knew
that would mean

32:55.274 --> 32:56.442
I'd go to prison for life.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.544
Looks like he's gotten past
that concern.

32:58.577 --> 33:00.279
JAKE: Which means you can be
sure he's long gone by now.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.148
GREGORIO:
All right, Claire.

33:02.181 --> 33:04.150
Anything you can tell us
to help track him down.

33:04.183 --> 33:05.784
Why would I help the same people

33:05.817 --> 33:07.786
who've kept me prisoner
all these years?
Whoa.

33:07.819 --> 33:10.156
We're not CIA or ATF.

33:10.189 --> 33:12.791
We have no intention
of locking you up.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.194
You help us find Kurtz,

33:15.227 --> 33:18.030
we'll set you free.

33:18.064 --> 33:19.231
CLAIRE:
I...

33:19.265 --> 33:21.233
don't know.

33:21.267 --> 33:23.569
He's my husband.
A bad one.

33:23.602 --> 33:25.537
Trust me, I know what
I'm talking about.

33:25.571 --> 33:27.206
He left you with that bag.

33:27.239 --> 33:29.075
You don't owe him nothing.

33:31.777 --> 33:35.314
Do something for yourself here.

33:39.385 --> 33:42.288
PRIDE:
Give me good news, guys.

33:42.321 --> 33:44.556
Well, Coast Guard intercepted
a ship 15 miles off the Gulf.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.258
We boarded half an hour ago.

33:46.292 --> 33:48.827
Yeah, no sign of Kurtz
or Hugo James Smith.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.262
We searched every inch
of this place.

33:50.296 --> 33:52.731
They never boarded, King.
Yeah, but, Pride,
there's something else.

33:52.764 --> 33:54.266
All the weapons are here

33:54.300 --> 33:55.701
except for the
Predator. It's gone.

33:56.768 --> 33:59.338
Get back here ASAP.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.207
Kurtz never left New Orleans.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.275
Well, how can you be so sure?

34:03.309 --> 34:04.210
He's got unfinished business.

34:04.243 --> 34:06.445
I think he killed Sutter
to save his wife.

34:10.282 --> 34:12.418
There's a good chance
Kurtz is still in the area

34:12.451 --> 34:15.487
and on his way here.
We need to go now.

34:15.521 --> 34:17.423
I'll get Claire in the SUV.

34:17.456 --> 34:19.658
You guys get to your car.
Take point.

34:24.330 --> 34:25.397
Ah!

34:29.201 --> 34:30.636
Get in!

34:30.669 --> 34:32.070
Get in!

34:54.293 --> 34:56.195
Jake, all right
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:56.228 --> 34:58.197
The bullets hit my vest.
I think my shoulder's busted,

34:58.230 --> 34:59.565
but these men need an ambulance.

34:59.598 --> 35:00.699
SONJA:
I called it in.

35:00.732 --> 35:02.134
The ambulance is on the way.

35:02.168 --> 35:03.235
Pride, we got ambushed.

35:03.269 --> 35:04.870
PRIDE:
What happened, Gregorio?

35:04.903 --> 35:06.572
Kurtz hit us hard.
He used that damn drone.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.274
Fired rockets at us.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.576
He drove up, took his wife.
They're gone.

35:10.609 --> 35:13.712
Looking for a gray,
late-model Jeep.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.547
I'm having NOPD put a BOLO out.

35:15.581 --> 35:16.848
They can't get far.

35:16.882 --> 35:18.284
Cancel the BOLO.

35:18.317 --> 35:19.685
What?

35:19.718 --> 35:21.187
If Kurtz was willing
to use that Predator once,

35:21.220 --> 35:22.421
he'll use it again.

35:22.454 --> 35:23.455
We can't have him firing off

35:23.489 --> 35:24.756
any more rockets in the city.

35:24.790 --> 35:25.757
We can't just let him get away.

35:25.791 --> 35:26.758
No, of course not.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.860
We just got to be smart
about tracking him down.

35:28.894 --> 35:30.229
Okay. How are we gonna do that?

35:30.262 --> 35:32.864
We're gonna follow the drone.

35:32.898 --> 35:34.633
"Follow the drone,"
the man says.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.302
Like it's that simple.

35:36.335 --> 35:38.704
Like it got a "find my
Predator" app built into it.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.306
Well, I mean, it kind of does.

35:40.339 --> 35:41.940
We just have to latch into
its navigation system,

35:41.973 --> 35:42.808
and since we got
all the serial numbers

35:42.841 --> 35:44.643
from the stolen computer
components...

35:44.676 --> 35:46.445
I know, Sebastian.
I'm working on it.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.214
LASALLE: How can we be sure
the signal leads us to Kurtz?

35:48.247 --> 35:49.881
I mean, can't
these things be flown

35:49.915 --> 35:51.183
from thousands of miles away?

35:51.217 --> 35:52.384
Well, military computers

35:52.418 --> 35:53.785
can navigate
from that kind of distance,

35:53.819 --> 35:55.787
but this drone was jury-rigged.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.856
Giving us a chance to find
the location of the pilot.

35:57.889 --> 35:58.724
And hopefully where Kurtz
is heading right now.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.192
You know, judging from
the radio signal

36:00.226 --> 36:01.560
and the range,

36:01.593 --> 36:03.895
I can tell you that that
drone is still in the air.

36:03.929 --> 36:05.297
I might be able to estimate
the flight pattern

36:05.331 --> 36:07.299
to a ten-mile radius.

36:07.333 --> 36:08.700
You're gonna have to be a
little bit more precise

36:08.734 --> 36:09.935
than just ten miles,
aren't you, Patton?

36:09.968 --> 36:12.971
You think you can find any sugar
cane fields in that radius?

36:13.004 --> 36:14.473
Like the trace we found
on Tyrell's body.

36:14.506 --> 36:15.707
Yeah, that could be
Kurtz's hideout.

36:15.741 --> 36:17.243
Not a field,

36:17.276 --> 36:19.545
but the old Galmont
processing plant is there.

36:19.578 --> 36:22.281
Could be ground zero.

36:22.314 --> 36:23.415
I'll call Pride.

36:31.257 --> 36:33.359
Got eyes on Kurtz.
Any sign of Claire at all?

36:33.392 --> 36:35.661
No, but Kurtz has a plane.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.329
They're planning their escape.

36:37.363 --> 36:39.665
All right, Gregorio, Sonja,
with me.

36:39.698 --> 36:40.966
Take Kurtz, find his wife.

36:40.999 --> 36:43.269
Sebastian, how you coming
with that drone?

36:43.302 --> 36:44.770
Patton says the control unit's
somewhere else on the property,

36:44.803 --> 36:45.971
so I'll stay on comms with him
while we search.

36:46.004 --> 36:48.307
Take Lasalle with you,
all right?

36:48.340 --> 36:50.709
We got to ground that Predator
before Kurtz uses it again.

36:56.482 --> 36:58.617
Don't move, Kurtz.
Hands up high.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.852
Turn around slow.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.322
Walk to me.

37:03.355 --> 37:04.623
Easy.

37:04.656 --> 37:05.857
Guess you caught me.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.459
Yeah, we did. Now wipe
that grin off your face

37:07.493 --> 37:08.960
and tell us where your wife is.

37:08.994 --> 37:10.296
Inside that building.

37:12.464 --> 37:13.999
His wife's in the sugar mill.

37:14.032 --> 37:15.434
Turn around.

37:15.467 --> 37:18.470
Easy. Get on your knees.

37:18.504 --> 37:20.839
Slow.

37:27.846 --> 37:30.582
Drop it.

37:34.953 --> 37:37.923
SONJA:
Uh, Pride?

37:37.956 --> 37:40.326
Think I found Claire.

37:40.359 --> 37:42.027
What are you doing, Claire?

37:42.060 --> 37:43.962
Getting the hell out of here.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.931
Drop the guns, and we'll leave.

37:45.964 --> 37:47.466
What makes you think
you can get away?

37:47.499 --> 37:48.800
You're outnumbered.

37:48.834 --> 37:51.470
Yeah, but you're outgunned.

37:53.505 --> 37:55.341
Uh, guys, the drone is back

37:55.374 --> 37:56.442
on the radar,
and it's moving fast.

37:56.475 --> 37:57.709
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, we know, Patton.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.478
Hey, any luck
finding the control center?

37:59.511 --> 38:00.712
I think we got something.

38:00.746 --> 38:01.947
Some sort of
maintenance building.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.349
That's a lot of antennae
on there

38:03.382 --> 38:04.350
for a glorified toolshed.

38:04.383 --> 38:05.384
Yeah, well, you better hurry

38:05.417 --> 38:06.618
'cause the drone
is two miles out.

38:09.455 --> 38:10.656
NCIS!

38:10.689 --> 38:11.923
Hands off the controls.

38:14.059 --> 38:15.394
Hands behind your back.

38:15.427 --> 38:16.495
Patton, we got him.

38:16.528 --> 38:17.663
Yeah, but the only problem

38:17.696 --> 38:19.498
is the drone is still on target.

38:19.531 --> 38:22.000
It's headed straight
for Pride and the others.

38:22.033 --> 38:24.670
Oh. Crap.

38:24.703 --> 38:27.339
Okay, uh...

38:27.373 --> 38:28.974
it looks like it's
on some kind of autopilot.

38:29.007 --> 38:31.443
Hey, Patton,
just a quick question here.

38:31.477 --> 38:34.713
Um, how do I fly
this thing?

38:35.714 --> 38:37.383
Why are you doing this, Claire?

38:37.416 --> 38:38.517
You're sacrificing everything

38:38.550 --> 38:39.918
for a man who's only
been using you.

38:39.951 --> 38:42.688
Willard's never made a move
without my say-so.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.656
What's the endgame here?

38:44.690 --> 38:46.358
That drone's gonna
blow us all to bits.

38:46.392 --> 38:47.526
I spent two years

38:47.559 --> 38:48.694
as a prisoner,

38:48.727 --> 38:50.762
taking crap
from people like you.

38:50.796 --> 38:52.330
I'd rather die than go back.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.439
PATTON:
Sebastian, do something.

39:00.472 --> 39:02.040
I'm in.

39:04.410 --> 39:05.377
Get her out of here. Go.

39:05.411 --> 39:07.979
Get her out. Go.

39:13.184 --> 39:16.788
Did it work?

39:16.822 --> 39:19.391
Pride, you there?

39:24.129 --> 39:26.131
We're here.

39:27.833 --> 39:29.701
Both suspects are under control.

39:29.735 --> 39:31.470
Good work, Sebastian.

39:31.503 --> 39:34.172
That was terrifying.
That was...

39:34.205 --> 39:36.608
that was real scary.
I peed.

39:36.642 --> 39:37.743
Just a little. It's all right.

40:05.871 --> 40:08.674
Let me help you out there.
Oh, hey.

40:08.707 --> 40:10.075
Got to be honest, Pride.

40:10.108 --> 40:11.843
I've had my problems
with you in the past,

40:11.877 --> 40:14.480
but you damn sure know how
to throw a cop's wake.

40:14.513 --> 40:16.682
To Mary.

40:16.715 --> 40:18.784
Crane was good police.

40:18.817 --> 40:21.520
The best, yeah.

40:21.553 --> 40:22.754
And, uh...

40:22.788 --> 40:25.791
hey, thanks for, uh,
catching her killers.

40:25.824 --> 40:27.693
We look out
for each other, right?

40:29.995 --> 40:32.163
Yes, we do.

40:32.197 --> 40:33.499
Hey, fellas, to Mary.

40:42.874 --> 40:45.043
Now look at that.

40:45.076 --> 40:48.680
You saved the day
and got the bad guys,

40:48.714 --> 40:51.182
all without breaking protocol.

40:51.216 --> 40:53.118
Threaded a needle for sure.

40:53.151 --> 40:55.554
But there was a price.

40:55.587 --> 40:57.088
Officer Crane.

40:57.122 --> 40:59.124
Sutter.

40:59.157 --> 41:01.960
Washington will want
someone to pay for it.

41:01.993 --> 41:04.062
All of it.
Sonja's friend.

41:04.095 --> 41:06.598
Yeah.

41:06.632 --> 41:08.199
It's too bad.

41:08.233 --> 41:09.234
SONJA:
They're saying
you're responsible?

41:09.267 --> 41:11.937
Sutter's dead.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.238
I'm her number two.

41:13.271 --> 41:15.907
And we let Kurtz play us.

41:15.941 --> 41:17.509
So, what are you gonna do?

41:17.543 --> 41:19.745
I'm resigning.

41:19.778 --> 41:21.246
I already turned
in my paperwork.
No.

41:21.279 --> 41:23.214
Probably gonna need a lawyer.

41:23.248 --> 41:24.950
You were only doing your job.

41:26.985 --> 41:29.087
No, I'm...

41:29.120 --> 41:30.589
I'm-a get out of here.

41:30.622 --> 41:33.592
No, no, no. Look, let's...

41:33.625 --> 41:35.260
let's both leave.

41:35.293 --> 41:37.495
We can go back
to my place.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.799
Any other day
I'd take you up on that

41:40.832 --> 41:42.300
in a heartbeat, but...

41:42.333 --> 41:44.536
I kind of need to be by myself.

41:45.671 --> 41:47.606
And...

41:49.240 --> 41:51.843
...not for nothing,
but, uh, keep your eyes open.

41:51.877 --> 41:54.980
I don't know your boss at all,
but I know his reputation.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.748
More Sazeracs, Johnny.

41:56.782 --> 41:58.316
Look, I told you,
Pride is a good person.

41:58.349 --> 42:00.552
Maybe so. Like I said,

42:00.586 --> 42:02.554
three years.

42:03.922 --> 42:06.057
Might be time to move on.

42:12.864 --> 42:14.332
See you, Bonnie.

42:14.365 --> 42:16.568
Later, Clyde.
