(calm music playing)

00:45.734 --> 00:49.266
(birds chirping)

01:06.500 --> 01:09.867
Pussycat, are you doing
the grocery shopping today?

01:09.934 --> 01:11.367
Yeah. Something you want?

01:11.433 --> 01:15.934
Uh, pick up a couple of chicken breasts
and, why don't we say, 40...

01:16.000 --> 01:19.433
Better make that 45 tubes
of sun screen.

01:19.834 --> 01:22.300
Oh, Sophia,
I've made that mistake before.

01:22.367 --> 01:26.433
It's best to just turn the oven down
if you don't want the chicken to burn.

01:27.433 --> 01:29.500
Rose, honey,

01:29.567 --> 01:33.266
I don't think my mother was planning
on using the suntan lotion on the chicken.

01:33.333 --> 01:35.667
What do you mean,
you've made that mistake before?

01:36.934 --> 01:40.734
President Bush is coming to dedicate
the new senior citizens' center.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.700
-The motorcade goes right by here.
-So?

01:43.767 --> 01:47.000
All the neighbors on the block
will be out on their lawns.

01:47.066 --> 01:50.600
It'll be 100 degrees outside
and they will need protection.

01:50.667 --> 01:53.467
They can pay me or fry in the sun.

01:53.533 --> 01:57.667
Oh, Ma, heh, that's a terrible thing
to do to your neighbors.

01:57.734 --> 02:00.467
-I'll cut you in for half.
-We should also sell visors.

02:02.233 --> 02:05.700
(calm music playing)

02:05.767 --> 02:08.100
There's a man on our lawn.

02:08.166 --> 02:09.667
Get the net.
(chuckles)

02:09.734 --> 02:11.166
(doorbell rings)

02:14.567 --> 02:17.667
Well, hello there.
Anything I can do for you?

02:17.734 --> 02:19.834
At least now she asks.

02:20.233 --> 02:24.233
Good afternoon. Sorry to bother you.
I'm Agent Bell with the Secret Service.

02:24.300 --> 02:28.400
-Well, won't you come right in?
-Thank you, Mrs. Devereaux.

02:28.467 --> 02:31.266
-How did you know my name?
-I know all your names.

02:31.333 --> 02:33.166
This house has been
under surveillance.

02:33.233 --> 02:34.900
Why are you watching our house?

02:34.967 --> 02:36.467
It's a security measure.

02:36.533 --> 02:38.533
The president wants to stop at one house

02:38.600 --> 02:41.200
before dedicating
the senior citizens' center.

02:41.266 --> 02:44.333
Why can't he use the Arco Station
like everyone else?

02:45.133 --> 02:47.934
Are you saying Mr. President Bush
might stop here?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.734
He wants to keep
in touch with the people.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.400
We chose this house as a possibility

02:52.467 --> 02:55.900
because four senior citizens
are living under one roof.

02:56.700 --> 02:59.633
Now, a few other houses
are being considered.

02:59.700 --> 03:02.200
If you don't mind,
I'll start with Mrs. Devereaux.

03:02.266 --> 03:04.367
Fine.
We'll be waiting in the kitchen.

03:04.433 --> 03:07.233
(inhales)
Not making fun of the vice president.

03:10.967 --> 03:13.734
Now that we're alone,
tell me all about yourself.

03:13.800 --> 03:17.133
-Uh, you first.
-(laughs)

03:17.200 --> 03:21.066
I've always been the kind of person
who liked to have fun.

03:21.133 --> 03:24.233
Oh, Dorothy, do you realize
it has been four days

03:24.300 --> 03:27.000
since I've enjoyed
the company of a man?

03:27.066 --> 03:28.300
I know, Blanche.

03:28.367 --> 03:32.233
I've been marking the days off
on my big ships of the navy calendar.

03:34.700 --> 03:36.700
I don't think
I can stand it much longer.

03:36.767 --> 03:40.600
My body feels like a corvette up
on blocks with its engine racing

03:40.667 --> 03:44.166
and wheels spinning and spinning
with nowhere to go.

03:44.233 --> 03:46.333
I feel like I'm going to explode.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.233
Dorothy, help me.
Do something.

03:48.300 --> 03:51.100
There's nothing I can do,
so get that look out of your eye

03:51.166 --> 03:53.734
-and let go of my hand.
-Oh.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.333
Girls, heh, I am so excited!

03:57.400 --> 04:00.800
-I just got a big bonus at work.
-Ah.

04:00.867 --> 04:02.567
Guess what I've decided to do
with it.

04:02.633 --> 04:03.600
-What?
-What?

04:03.667 --> 04:06.734
I'm going to have
my breasts enlarged.

04:10.467 --> 04:13.333
Uh, you're not serious, Blanche?

04:13.400 --> 04:16.667
Oh, sure, I am.
Breasts are back in fashion.

04:16.734 --> 04:21.700
And what God didn't give me,
Dr. Myron Rosenzweig will.

04:21.767 --> 04:25.900
Oh, that man is the Picasso
of plastic surgeons.

04:25.967 --> 04:29.367
Be sure he doesn't attach one
to your forehead. (laughs)

04:29.433 --> 04:31.200
Yes. (laughs)

04:32.133 --> 04:33.333
Oh, Rose, hi.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.900
Listen, I just picked up these pamphlets
at a cosmetic surgeon's

04:36.967 --> 04:40.400
and I want you to help me decide
which alterations I'll get.

04:44.166 --> 04:47.100
Blanche, none of these women
have any tops on.

04:47.500 --> 04:51.400
Well, I know, honey. These are the
after pictures of satisfied customers.

04:51.467 --> 04:54.867
I was thinking about having
my breasts done like hers.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.467
All right, Blanche,
but you think black really suits you?

05:02.300 --> 05:03.400
Here you go, sweetheart.

05:03.467 --> 05:06.767
Dorothy, have you ever heard
of something called dirty dancing?

05:06.834 --> 05:10.033
Well, of course, Blanche.
They did it in that movie.

05:10.100 --> 05:13.300
-What movie?
<i>-Lawrence of Arabia, </i>Rose.

05:15.166 --> 05:17.200
This flier that came in the mail says

05:17.266 --> 05:19.266
they're going to start
a dirty dancing course

05:19.333 --> 05:22.166
down at Lawson's Dance Studio.

05:22.233 --> 05:23.467
What do you say, Dorothy?

05:23.533 --> 05:26.567
Oh, no.
I can't see myself swinging my hips

05:26.633 --> 05:31.033
and wildly gyrating my pelvis,
I am not interested.

05:31.100 --> 05:34.166
And the world heaves
a collective sigh of relief.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.567
Just hit that music, girl,
and follow my lead.

05:43.000 --> 05:43.934
(salsa music playing)

05:44.000 --> 05:45.867
Look into my eyes.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.934
(laughs)

06:13.667 --> 06:15.200
(music stops)

06:23.767 --> 06:25.200
Hi, girls.

06:27.166 --> 06:28.967
This is not what it looks like.

06:30.533 --> 06:31.934
What they do is their business,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.934
but if I ever see your hand
on Rose's behind, it'll kill me.

06:37.834 --> 06:38.834
Oh.

06:38.900 --> 06:44.166
-Wow, what a hunk.
-I know. Eat your hearts out.

06:44.233 --> 06:49.200
Blanche, did it ever occur to you that
Rose or I might be interested in Jake?

06:49.266 --> 06:50.333
Yes.

06:50.400 --> 06:54.433
And you still used every cheap ploy
to nab him before we could?

06:54.500 --> 06:58.967
-What do you have to say for yourself?
-Damn, I'm good. (chuckles)

07:02.100 --> 07:03.834
Well, thank you, Mrs. Devereaux.

07:03.900 --> 07:05.533
If the President decides to come,

07:05.600 --> 07:08.700
this administration
would appreciate it if...

07:08.767 --> 07:10.767
Well, if you didn't hit on him.

07:13.300 --> 07:16.500
I thought everybody
would like some Flugel Kaka.

07:17.734 --> 07:20.166
Mrs. Nylund, would you mind answering
a few questions?

07:20.233 --> 07:22.567
As long as it's not math.

07:22.967 --> 07:26.467
Here, honey. Why don't you sit down?
He's very nice.

07:28.333 --> 07:30.767
Oh, if you need to know
anything else about me,

07:30.834 --> 07:32.834
uh, I have pictures.

07:33.633 --> 07:34.567
So do we.

07:37.133 --> 07:40.633
Now, our records show that
you come from a town called St. Olaf?

07:40.700 --> 07:42.800
-(chuckles)
-You want to tell me about it?

07:44.934 --> 07:46.934
Mrs. Nylund, are you all right?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.900
It's just that nobody's ever
asked before.

07:51.333 --> 07:52.867
Well, uh...

07:52.934 --> 07:54.100
I don't get it.

07:54.166 --> 07:56.100
They don't seem
to have anything in common.

07:56.166 --> 07:59.100
I guess it's just like that old saying,
"Opposites attract".

07:59.166 --> 08:01.000
Oh, that's very true.

08:01.066 --> 08:04.867
Back in St. Olaf, Ollie Knudenspringle
and his wife Ridget

08:04.934 --> 08:07.533
were opposites in every way.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.000
I mean, he was fat.
She was thin.

08:10.066 --> 08:12.900
He was neat.
She was sloppy.

08:12.967 --> 08:15.967
He was tall.
She was short. (exhales)

08:16.033 --> 08:18.834
He was cheap.
She was extravagant.

08:20.533 --> 08:23.600
-He was...
-Opposites. We get the picture.

08:26.333 --> 08:30.033
Well, anyway, I'll never forget when
they sang at our annual talent show,

08:30.100 --> 08:32.300
right after the herring juggling act.

08:32.767 --> 08:36.800
You mean to tell me that somebody
actually juggled herring?

08:36.867 --> 08:38.500
No!

08:38.567 --> 08:40.934
It was the herring
who did the juggling...

08:42.934 --> 08:45.200
Tiny little Ginsu knives.

08:46.266 --> 08:47.800
Really very dangerous.

08:47.867 --> 08:51.433
I mean, one false move,
they could have filleted themselves.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.567
-(Rose sighs)
-I hate you.

08:58.967 --> 09:02.133
Rose, what in hell are you doing?
It is 2:00 a.m.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.433
I couldn't sleep
so I decided to get up

09:04.500 --> 09:07.200
and make a batch
of Sparehuven Krispies.

09:09.100 --> 09:11.734
It's an ancient Scandinavian
midnight snack.

09:11.800 --> 09:14.066
I guess after a night of pillaging
and raping,

09:14.133 --> 09:17.834
a Viking wants a little something
to go with his cocoa.

09:18.867 --> 09:20.767
Well, they smell God awful.

09:20.834 --> 09:23.500
Yeah. When you're about ready
to throw up from the stench,

09:23.567 --> 09:25.233
that's when they're done.

09:25.300 --> 09:26.400
Who wants some?

09:28.033 --> 09:30.333
Rose, if these had been offered
to the donner party,

09:30.400 --> 09:32.467
they still would've eaten each other.

09:33.266 --> 09:35.834
Don't be silly, Dorothy.
They're delicious.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.567
You just have to know
how to eat them.

09:37.633 --> 09:39.633
You hold your nose with one hand

09:39.700 --> 09:43.000
and pop a Krispie in your mouth
with the other.

09:43.467 --> 09:47.934
Mmm. Mmm. It tastes like
cheesecake, fresh strawberries,

09:47.967 --> 09:49.533
and chocolate ice cream.

09:49.600 --> 09:52.066
Mmm.

09:56.266 --> 09:57.567
My gosh, you're right.

09:57.633 --> 10:00.533
(Rose) That is the best thing
I have ever tasted.

10:01.433 --> 10:03.367
Oh, this is delicious.

10:03.433 --> 10:04.400
-(Blanche) Mmm!
-(Rose) Oh!

10:05.200 --> 10:06.800
Hi, Ma.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.367
Hey, give me a break.
You can't smell that from the hall.

10:16.467 --> 10:21.133
Then there was the time Hans Erickson
wanted to take an elk to the prom.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.266
The whole town
was divided on that one.

10:24.800 --> 10:27.300
Pussycat, if you're writing to
your brother Phil,

10:27.367 --> 10:30.266
tell him,
I said thanks for the Underoos,

10:30.333 --> 10:33.033
and spiderman scared the hell
out of my doctor.

10:34.166 --> 10:38.066
No. I'm not writing to Phil.
I'm jotting down some things

10:38.133 --> 10:40.266
that I want to say to the President.

10:40.333 --> 10:42.266
You're not going to make a scene,
are you?

10:42.333 --> 10:45.066
Oh, hey, come on.
Give me a little credit.

10:45.133 --> 10:47.800
I mean, it's not like
I'm some kind of hothead.

10:47.867 --> 10:50.467
Please. I'd put you about even
with John Mcenroe,

10:50.533 --> 10:52.934
except Mcenroe knows when to stop.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.200
Come on, Ma.

10:54.266 --> 10:57.967
She's right. Don't you remember
the time... how could you forget?

10:58.033 --> 11:01.767
These were the only spare towels.
Put them around the bucket.

11:01.834 --> 11:06.166
Wait, Rose. Is that my
Cabana Club beach towel?

11:06.233 --> 11:09.467
(Blanche) Does it have a naked man
and woman being swept up in the waves?

11:09.533 --> 11:12.633
Yes, that's it.
We can't use this towel.

11:12.700 --> 11:15.066
Blanche, Blanche,
it's an emergency!

11:15.133 --> 11:16.300
We'll replace it next week.

11:16.367 --> 11:18.400
Oh, no.
You cannot replace this towel.

11:18.467 --> 11:21.200
There are too many fond memories
attached to it.

11:21.266 --> 11:23.600
Blanche, please,
I am in no mood to hear

11:23.667 --> 11:27.834
about the parade of endless sexual
encounters that you have experienced

11:27.900 --> 11:31.533
up and down the Florida coastline
with only this towel

11:31.600 --> 11:34.500
between your hot flesh
and the cold, wet sand!

11:37.333 --> 11:42.800
I brought my son Skippy home
from the hospital in this towel, Dorothy.

11:44.700 --> 11:46.300
You're lying, Blanche.

11:49.767 --> 11:51.367
Damn, you're good!

11:53.533 --> 11:55.934
<i>♪ Happy birthday, boys and girls ♪</i>

11:56.000 --> 11:58.333
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

11:58.400 --> 12:01.867
Welcome to Mr. Ha Ha's
Hot Dog Hacienda!

12:01.934 --> 12:05.233
-Yay! Whoa! Yay!
-(all cheering)

12:05.300 --> 12:08.500
Isn't this fun?

12:08.567 --> 12:11.734
Dorothy, you haven't even touched
your Mr. Ha Ha Dog.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.900
(laughs) You're right.

12:18.734 --> 12:20.033
There. I touched it.

12:20.100 --> 12:23.533
And now it's time for the
Mr. Ha Ha birthday roundup!

12:23.600 --> 12:27.400
When I call your name,
please come on stage.

12:30.934 --> 12:33.000
Bobby Spina!

12:33.867 --> 12:36.867
Please say you didn't do this,
Rose.

12:36.934 --> 12:38.467
(Mr. Ha Ha) Jean Taylor!

12:38.533 --> 12:41.100
Please tell me you didn't do this.

12:41.166 --> 12:42.500
Dorothy Zbornak!

12:42.567 --> 12:44.166
(Dorothy)
Oh, no!

12:45.166 --> 12:46.934
I just wish you'd watch yourself,
Dorothy,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.500
because we're all pretty excited
about this visit.

12:49.567 --> 12:50.800
Forget it, Rose.

12:50.867 --> 12:55.033
If President Bush steps in this house,
I'm not going to waste that opportunity.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.000
I'll give him a piece of my mind.

12:59.667 --> 13:02.533
(soft music playing)

13:04.500 --> 13:06.233
You try and talk to her.

13:06.300 --> 13:09.567
If the President comes here,
you can't criticize him.

13:09.633 --> 13:10.333
Watch me.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.834
Dorothy, never antagonize a man

13:12.900 --> 13:15.467
who could answer the question,
"You and what army?"

13:16.400 --> 13:18.700
What's your gripe with the President,
anyway?

13:18.767 --> 13:21.667
He calls himself
the education president,

13:21.734 --> 13:25.867
but our education system
has some serious problems.

13:25.934 --> 13:28.734
I see the illiteracy.
I see dropouts.

13:28.800 --> 13:32.734
I see kids who can't even find India
on a map.

13:32.800 --> 13:36.000
Well, to be fair, Dorothy,
that stumped Columbus, too.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.767
And education
is just part of the problem.

13:39.834 --> 13:42.834
I mean, there's age discrimination,
women's rights.

13:42.900 --> 13:47.700
(Dorothy) Oh, Rose.
Rose, honey.

13:47.767 --> 13:51.934
Now, why didn't you tell us
what was going on?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.734
Because you can't help me find a job,

13:54.800 --> 13:57.934
because nobody or nothing
can make me young again.

13:58.033 --> 14:02.033
All right, so your life isn't the same
as it used to be.

14:02.100 --> 14:05.333
The rules have changed,
but it's happened before, hasn't it?

14:05.400 --> 14:07.667
I mean, what did you do
after Charlie died?

14:08.900 --> 14:10.367
Buried him.

14:12.400 --> 14:17.166
I mean, what did you do the next day
when you had to put your life together?

14:17.233 --> 14:21.100
I couldn't do it.
I'd been a housewife for 32 years.

14:21.166 --> 14:23.233
I totally depended on Charlie.

14:23.300 --> 14:26.033
Yeah, but eventually,
you did what you had to do.

14:26.100 --> 14:30.033
You took care of yourself.
You're in exactly the same position.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.000
Not exactly!

14:32.066 --> 14:35.900
I'm five years older,
and nobody wants me around.

14:35.967 --> 14:38.533
Oh, honey, we want you around.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.266
We just can't afford to pay you.

14:41.667 --> 14:44.033
Look, Rose.
Rose, look at me.

14:44.100 --> 14:47.166
Rose, listen.
You are feeling sorry for yourself.

14:47.233 --> 14:51.300
Sure, you're five years older.
So am I. So is Blanche.

14:51.367 --> 14:53.033
All right, so...

14:53.667 --> 14:57.600
You have a few more wrinkles.
So do I. So has Blanche.

15:00.800 --> 15:04.233
All right, you're a little thicker
around the middle. So is Blanche.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.800
Oh, girls, I'm devastated,
just devastated!

15:11.867 --> 15:15.800
-Honey, what happened?
-I asked my teacher for help.

15:15.867 --> 15:19.367
He said the only way I'd get an A
is if I sleep with him.

15:19.433 --> 15:21.000
-No!
-Yes.

15:21.066 --> 15:23.900
-I don't know what to do.
-Get it in writing.

15:30.567 --> 15:33.900
Blanche, that is terrible.
I hope you told him off.

15:33.967 --> 15:36.667
First I was so stunned,
I didn't know what to say.

15:36.734 --> 15:40.233
Then I marched back up to his desk,
looked him in the eye,

15:40.300 --> 15:42.400
and said, "I'll think it over."

15:42.467 --> 15:44.700
Blanche, there is nothing to think over.

15:44.767 --> 15:48.867
What he did is sexual harassment.
He cannot get away with that.

15:48.934 --> 15:51.967
Neils Wilander attempted
to harass me repeatedly.

15:52.433 --> 15:54.300
What do you mean, he attempted to?

15:54.367 --> 15:57.934
He worked at Lars Erickson's drugstore
and tackle shop.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.066
He was a soda jerk.

16:00.133 --> 16:02.834
Now that I think about it,
he was the town jerk.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.834
Every Saturday afternoon,
I'd go in and have a sundae.

16:06.900 --> 16:12.066
Well, Neils would arrange the
ice cream scoops in an obscene way.

16:20.300 --> 16:21.567
I could never prove it,

16:21.633 --> 16:25.300
because by the time I would
take it home to show my father...

16:31.734 --> 16:34.033
-The evidence had melted.
-Melted.

16:37.233 --> 16:42.400
To this day, every time I pass
an ice cream parlor or a tackle shop,

16:42.467 --> 16:43.767
I blush.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.433
(sighs)

16:48.500 --> 16:50.934
Well, I just got off the phone
with Washington.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.533
I'm sorry, ladies,
but the President would prefer

16:53.600 --> 16:55.867
to visit a more typical
American family.

16:55.934 --> 16:58.166
Typical?
We're typical.

16:58.233 --> 17:01.433
I'm the mother,
and I have 2.3 children.

17:01.500 --> 17:04.300
You won't find a more typical
family than that.

17:04.367 --> 17:07.533
Girls, look.
How do I look?

17:07.600 --> 17:10.800
-(Rose) Great, Blanche.
-Great or gorgeous?

17:10.867 --> 17:13.400
-Gorgeous.
-Well, what about sexy?

17:13.467 --> 17:15.233
-Yes.
-Enticing?

17:15.300 --> 17:16.567
I'll handle this.

17:16.633 --> 17:21.166
Blanche, no woman ever looked
better than you look right now,

17:21.233 --> 17:23.066
and no one ever will.

17:25.667 --> 17:28.100
(chuckles)

17:28.166 --> 17:29.734
Thank you, Dorothy.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.000
Honestly, Rose,
sometimes it's like pulling teeth

17:32.066 --> 17:34.400
to get a little compliment
out of you.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.767
What do you say, girls,
are you in this with me?

17:38.600 --> 17:40.667
You bet we are, honey.

17:40.734 --> 17:42.734
This is what friendship is all about.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.467
Banding together
when the going gets tough.

17:45.533 --> 17:48.767
Sacrificing sleep
and personal comfort,

17:48.834 --> 17:52.000
and putting someone else's need
ahead of your own.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.400
It's beautiful.

17:54.800 --> 17:57.033
Let me know how it turns out
in the morning.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.000
Let's make a pact.

18:03.066 --> 18:05.200
That we'll always
take care of each other,

18:05.266 --> 18:07.500
that we'll never desert each other,
no matter what.

18:07.567 --> 18:08.967
You can count on me, honey.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.066
You think it's gonna be that
easy getting rid of me, Rose?

18:13.166 --> 18:14.667
That was rhetorical, Rose.

18:16.700 --> 18:20.967
Ah, but what a comforting thought.
Knowing you'll never be alone.

18:21.033 --> 18:24.133
And, listen, what the hell,
if we do have to go to a nursing home,

18:24.200 --> 18:26.100
let's all go together.

18:26.166 --> 18:29.066
(all laughing)

18:30.467 --> 18:32.800
What happens
when there's only one of us left?

18:35.934 --> 18:37.800
Don't worry,
I can take care of myself.

18:41.033 --> 18:44.066
Easy, easy.
Ma, that's my best China.

18:45.367 --> 18:48.200
You got it for me when I got married.
You remember?

18:48.266 --> 18:51.734
Who could forget?
I carried it all the way from Sicily.

18:53.033 --> 18:55.367
And for what?
So you could get divorced.

18:55.433 --> 18:58.767
I should have gotten you
something returnable like a donkey.

19:00.567 --> 19:04.800
You know, I've eaten through
a lot of great times on these plates.

19:04.867 --> 19:09.633
You know, with Alma here,
I've been thinking a lot about us.

19:09.700 --> 19:10.700
Oh? What do you mean?

19:11.166 --> 19:15.066
The one thing you never do
is treat me like an old lady.

19:15.133 --> 19:19.266
You treat me like a person.
I appreciate that.

19:20.667 --> 19:22.233
You're a good daughter, Dorothy.

19:23.333 --> 19:26.900
Ma, I'm overwhelmed.
I don't know what to say.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.000
I'll tell you what you could say.

19:30.500 --> 19:33.333
You could say
I don't owe you the $50.

19:36.700 --> 19:42.600
Ma, you are a crazy lady, and I love you.
I love you. I love you. Muah.

19:42.667 --> 19:46.100
I love you, too, pussycat.

19:48.767 --> 19:49.934
That's beautiful.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.266
I've got to try to convince him
to choose you guys.

19:53.934 --> 19:56.433
You're as close as any family
I've ever seen.

19:57.734 --> 19:59.934
I can't believe he bought it.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.967
What do you mean, Sophia?
We get along great.

20:03.033 --> 20:06.200
He doesn't know what it's like
living with you monkeys.

20:06.667 --> 20:09.066
I get sick every time
I think of when...

20:09.133 --> 20:14.567
-Ma, Rose isn't talking to me.
-Enjoy it while it lasts. Good night.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.900
Honey. Oh, hi, Dorothy.
Honey, could I talk to you?

20:17.967 --> 20:20.767
-Go away.
-But I can't sleep, Sophia.

20:20.834 --> 20:23.233
It's all because
Rose isn't talking to me.

20:23.300 --> 20:26.133
I could care less.
Get out of my room.

20:26.200 --> 20:28.633
-Sophia?
-I'm not in.

20:28.700 --> 20:31.400
Wait for the beep
then leave a message.

20:33.934 --> 20:34.900
Beep.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.100
(Rose)
Hi. This is Rose. I...

20:41.133 --> 20:43.066
Rose, shut up and get in here!

20:45.266 --> 20:49.133
Oh, I see you're with two double-crossing
ex-friends of mine.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.800
-I'll come back later.
-What do you think this is, the 7-Eleven?

20:51.867 --> 20:53.367
I'm not open all night.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.667
Rose, we feel terrible
about what we've done.

20:56.734 --> 20:58.934
-What have you done?
-We're sorry.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.166
-Sorry about what?
-Sorry isn't good enough.

21:01.233 --> 21:04.333
-How can I trust you again?
-Please, Rose.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.233
Let's not talk about trust after
the terrible things you wrote.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.600
Will someone tell me
what you're talking about?

21:09.667 --> 21:11.333
Blanche and I read Rose's diary.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.166
She wrote some terrible things
about us in there.

21:14.233 --> 21:17.734
About you?
I didn't write anything about you.

21:17.800 --> 21:20.200
I didn't even know you
when I kept that diary.

21:20.266 --> 21:23.767
-What are you talking about?
-That was my 4-H diary.

21:23.834 --> 21:27.600
I kept it one summer when
I raised two pigs for the county fair.

21:34.333 --> 21:37.600
You kept a diary
about raising two pigs?

21:37.667 --> 21:41.000
You know another way
to get a 4-H pig diary badge?

21:42.367 --> 21:46.467
Fidel, stop it. Even surgical stockings
only have so much elastic. (laughs)

21:47.867 --> 21:48.900
Hello.

21:48.967 --> 21:51.000
This nightgown is so sheer

21:51.066 --> 21:53.967
I believe you can see right through it.

21:54.033 --> 21:56.233
Oh. Hello, Fidel.

21:56.300 --> 21:58.367
Hello, Blanche, how are you?

21:58.433 --> 22:00.934
You don't have cataracts.
You tell me.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.867
Beat it,
you 50-year-old mattress.

22:08.967 --> 22:12.700
Oh! Why, you...
You miserable, old--

22:12.767 --> 22:15.333
Blanche, you know the rules.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.266
When one of you is out with Fidel,
the other one doesn't interfere.

22:18.333 --> 22:21.100
(claps) My apologies.

22:21.166 --> 22:22.700
Now, if you'll excuse me,

22:22.767 --> 22:26.867
I'm going to go take a long,
hot, steamy bath

22:26.934 --> 22:32.533
with just enough water
to barely cover my perky bosoms.

22:35.867 --> 22:38.166
You're only going to sit
in an inch of water?

22:40.600 --> 22:43.400
Oh, that does it.
That does it!

22:43.467 --> 22:46.967
Let me at her!
No, no, no!

22:47.033 --> 22:48.700
Why don't we have a pet?

22:48.767 --> 22:51.533
-Anybody want a cracker?
-Never mind.

22:51.934 --> 22:53.467
(doorbell rings)

22:58.367 --> 23:01.100
Good evening.
I guess you know why I'm here.

23:01.166 --> 23:05.967
Sure. Nobody can leave after just
one helping of Flugel kaka.

23:06.033 --> 23:08.233
No, and don't kid about that.

23:09.467 --> 23:14.000
No, I'm here to tell you that tomorrow
the President of the United States

23:14.066 --> 23:16.533
will be coming to your house.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.066
Oh.

23:18.133 --> 23:19.467
(chuckles)

23:19.533 --> 23:22.033
How did you do that?

23:22.834 --> 23:26.000
(theme music playing)
