00:00.700 --> 00:03.200
HOT PLATE

00:07.570 --> 00:11.010
you know how when a waiter tells you
not to touch your plate because it's hot,

00:11.020 --> 00:12.410
you immediately have to touch it?

00:12.430 --> 00:15.920
I mean,I guess there's a part of you that
wants to see how hot the plate really is.

00:15.940 --> 00:20.570
But maybe you touch it because
inside,you just wanna do something wrong.

00:21.270 --> 00:22.950
did you hear that?

00:22.970 --> 00:24.040
What was it? The door?

00:24.050 --> 00:26.160
No. My back cracked.

00:26.170 --> 00:28.080
oh,god. I love that.

00:28.090 --> 00:30.010
Oh,don't do that to me.
If chloe catches us...

00:30.020 --> 00:31.880
oh,she's not gonna catch us.

00:31.890 --> 00:33.710
I saw her get into a
cab five minutes ago.

00:33.720 --> 00:34.920
- She didn't see you,did she?
- No,no.

00:34.930 --> 00:37.980
I was hiding behind a newspaper,which
was very informative,by the way.

00:37.990 --> 00:41.010
Did you know that we have never
had a black president or a woman?

00:41.030 --> 00:43.340
This country's wei.

00:45.850 --> 00:48.070
- your back.
- Not my back.

00:52.360 --> 00:55.510
- frank,it's you.
- Pardon me.

00:55.520 --> 00:57.820
I thought you said you
weren't going to be home

00:57.830 --> 01:01.410
and that I should leave your
"as seen on tv" package inside.

01:01.430 --> 01:02.850
I changed my mind. A lot of work.

01:02.860 --> 01:05.040
All the ph-photography,you know?

01:05.050 --> 01:07.010
I mean,enough with the weddings already.

01:07.020 --> 01:09.570
Take the money and buy a house,people.

01:15.270 --> 01:17.570
where shall I put the package?

01:17.600 --> 01:21.200
Okay,look,frank,lately,things
haven't been great with chloe and me.

01:21.220 --> 01:22.850
Maybe she moved in too soon.

01:22.880 --> 01:27.080
Maybe we're just different
people. Relationships. Am I right?

01:27.090 --> 01:29.520
- By the table?
- Perfect.

01:35.020 --> 01:36.670
Don't judge me,anK.

01:36.690 --> 01:40.200
Oh,that ship sailed a long time ago.

01:41.280 --> 01:44.470
You ever thought about
running for president?

01:45.870 --> 01:47.160
In the couch?

01:47.180 --> 01:49.490
What were you hiding as,spare change?

01:50.180 --> 01:51.360
I panicked,all right?

01:51.380 --> 01:52.760
Have you ever seen todd's back?

01:52.770 --> 01:54.070
That chick has nails.

01:54.090 --> 01:56.600
My heart is still beating like
crazy. You gotta feel this.

01:56.610 --> 01:58.650
Yeah,I'm--I'm--I'm kinda
creeped out by the fact

01:58.670 --> 02:01.780
that there's something in our chests
that's pumping blood. I do not like that.

02:01.790 --> 02:03.030
I've never been so scared.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.330
And you love every second of it.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.580
Where is everyone today?

02:07.610 --> 02:08.610
What do I love?

02:08.630 --> 02:11.720
The sneaking around,the cheating on
boyfriends,being the other woman--

02:11.730 --> 02:12.940
you get off on it.

02:12.950 --> 02:15.470
You know,I bet if I bought this
place,I could double the business.

02:15.940 --> 02:19.230
I've always wanted to own my own
coffee shop. We could be partners.

02:19.240 --> 02:23.470
Oh,yeah,and we can live above the store
and have great adventures together.

02:23.480 --> 02:27.960
You know,just because I used to like to sneak
around does not mean I still do,all right?

02:27.980 --> 02:32.150
It's like,just because if I like chocolate
before the accident does not mean that I still do.

02:32.160 --> 02:33.530
You're eating a chocolate croissant.

02:33.550 --> 02:34.810
I don't like sneaking around!

02:34.820 --> 02:37.960
First @hing I would do,I'd fire
everyone. That would be fun.

02:38.660 --> 02:40.200
We could call it "andena."

02:40.210 --> 02:43.410
Th--that's a combination of both of
our names. I just thought of that.

02:43.420 --> 02:47.370
I mean,I don't-- I don't need some kind of
buzz,you know,just to be excited about todd.

02:47.380 --> 02:50.690
Right. That's why you only started
liking him after he started dating chloe.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.860
That is
no not tr--

02:55.030 --> 02:59.020
Oh,my god. It is.,My
god. I do like the buzz.

02:59.030 --> 03:02.000
I love the buzz. I get off on the buzz.

03:02.010 --> 03:05.200
- Okay.
- Wait. Do I hate that about me?

03:05.760 --> 03:07.220
No,I do not.

03:07.240 --> 03:10.550
Well,you know what they say
about the forbidden fruit.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.550
No,I do not.

03:12.560 --> 03:16.160
Hey,todd,uh,so I got your
message,and,uh,12:00 is good,

03:16.190 --> 03:20.640
so I will meet you on the
bridge by the park. Wait.

03:20.650 --> 03:22.920
No one checks these
messages but you,right?

03:22.930 --> 03:27.460
Uh,yeah. So,uh,okay. Yeah,I'll
see y,um,on the thing by the thing.

03:27.890 --> 03:30.200
This is your dry cleaner.

03:30.850 --> 03:32.550
Sam.

03:33.150 --> 03:35.350
Where are you going dressed all snazzy?

03:35.380 --> 03:38.880
Me? Nowhere.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.560
Just off to play some
bridge with the ladies.

03:42.600 --> 03:45.990
Like that? With the
boobs and everything?

03:46.000 --> 03:50.240
Oh,these? Yeah,well,the gals are always
showing off theirs,so I'm like,uh,

03:50.250 --> 03:52.970
why not rub mine in their faces?

03:55.360 --> 03:58.050
Um,I'll tell all the gals you said hi.

03:58.060 --> 04:01.570
Yeah. I don't even
know who the gals are.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.720
Te galsI-I can't name them.

04:04.730 --> 04:06.980
Do you know all your friends' names?

04:07.320 --> 04:09.810
I-I gotta go. We tee off in 20 minutes.

04:09.820 --> 04:13.630
Wait. I thought... you said
you were playing bridge.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.370
We are. Between holes.

04:16.380 --> 04:19.300
The course plays very
slow. A lot of old people.

04:19.690 --> 04:22.530
If I ever get like that,pull the plug.

04:31.740 --> 04:33.110
where have you been?

04:33.140 --> 04:36.230
sorry. I told chloe I was
gonna play basketball...

04:36.240 --> 04:39.410
And I-I wanted it to look real,so
I jumped into a pickup game.

04:39.430 --> 04:42.400
Then it went into overtime,and
you had to win by 2 points.

04:42.410 --> 04:45.350
Oh,yeah. I mean,I-I could've
helped you get sweaty,but yeah.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.130
Look,I'm sorry. I'm bad at this.

04:47.140 --> 04:50.450
When she asked me who I was
going out with,I blanked.

04:50.460 --> 04:52.420
I couldn't even think
of my own friends' names.

04:52.430 --> 04:54.840
I said "lancelot." It was a disaster.

04:54.850 --> 04:57.970
Anyway,I'm here now,so...

04:58.920 --> 05:02.650
oh,my god! My mother
wasn't gonna play golf.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.970
That may be the unsexiest
line I've ever heard.

05:06.250 --> 05:08.400
My mother's having an affair.

05:08.410 --> 05:09.810
And we have a new winner.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.540
Your mother's not having an affair.

05:21.550 --> 05:22.720
You didn't see her,all right?

05:22.730 --> 05:26.430
She was definitely sneaking off
somewhere to get some strange.

05:26.440 --> 05:27.620
Sam,you're projecting.

05:27.630 --> 05:30.290
You just think she's having
an affair because you are.

05:30.300 --> 05:31.520
You think?

05:31.540 --> 05:34.830
Come on. She's not the kind of
woman who has an affair,is she?

05:34.840 --> 05:37.290
No. No,she's the kind of
woman who collects roosters.

05:37.300 --> 05:38.940
God. What is the matter with me?

05:38.950 --> 05:40.460
You know what? Nothing. Nothing.

05:40.470 --> 05:43.620
You feel guilty,and
you know what? So do I.

05:43.630 --> 05:45.940
That's why I've got
to put an end to this.

05:45.950 --> 05:47.340
You want to stop seeing me?

05:47.360 --> 05:49.520
No. I'm breaking up with chloe.

05:49.530 --> 05:53.940
Oh,good! Wait! No,don'T.

05:53.950 --> 05:55.390
Well,I thought you
wanted to be together.

05:55.400 --> 05:58.730
Well,of course I do. I'm
just,um,I'm kinda worried.

05:58.740 --> 06:00.580
About what?

06:00.590 --> 06:03.800
About you,'cause,you
know,I,uh,it's just--

06:03.810 --> 06:05.740
I'm--I'm feeling like maybe
you're with me because you--

06:05.750 --> 06:08.350
you know,you kinda get off
on all this sneaking around.

06:08.370 --> 06:11.220
- Yeah,I really don't
think-- - We're out of time.

06:11.230 --> 06:12.930
- well,we should talk about this.
- Tomorrow.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.430
Tomorrow we will talk about you
getting off on all theneaking.

06:16.900 --> 06:17.850
So where do you wanna meet?

06:17.860 --> 06:19.180
At a hotel. Check in as "mty."

06:19.190 --> 06:21.730
Monty. Yeah. What?

06:23.490 --> 06:26.300
I don't know why everyone thinks
that sneaking around is so bad.

06:26.310 --> 06:29.270
I mean,spies do it,you know,and--and
they're defending the country.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.460
So I'm like a patriot.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.440
Oh,thanks,sam.

06:33.470 --> 06:35.970
You know what? I started to feel
so bad about what I was doing

06:35.980 --> 06:39.580
that I actually thought my
own mother was screwing around.

06:40.260 --> 06:42.970
how stupid is that?

06:43.960 --> 06:45.060
You know what?

06:45.080 --> 06:48.160
I think I'm gonna go see how
much they want for this place.

06:48.690 --> 06:50.530
I'm gonna go with her.

06:52.350 --> 06:53.620
What's going on?

06:53.640 --> 06:56.160
Nothing. I just wanted
to watch her negotiate.

06:56.170 --> 06:57.290
why? Is something going on?

06:57.300 --> 07:00.630
Andrea,you know
something,and I wanna hear it.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.880
There was an incident a few years ago.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.600
You and I were coming out of a club.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.950
And?

07:08.960 --> 07:11.950
Sorry. Usually by now,you're like,"oh,my
god!" And then you remember everything.

07:11.960 --> 07:14.310
Just tell me the story,please.

07:17.720 --> 07:20.060
- is that your mom over there?
- Th is your mom.

07:20.070 --> 07:21.780
No,really. Is that your mom?

07:21.790 --> 07:23.920
- That's your mom.
- No!

07:23.930 --> 07:25.490
That's my mom.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.900
regina newly!

07:31.480 --> 07:34.100
Sam. Andrea.

07:36.370 --> 07:39.620
- What are you doing here?
- Me? Nothing.

07:39.630 --> 07:41.870
Just cheese... t-tasting it...

07:41.880 --> 07:45.380
just tasting cheese with... the gals.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.920
Someone's not wearing her wedding ring.

07:48.930 --> 07:53.780
Oh,well,cheese makes me bloat,especially
roquefort and some cheddars,the occasional goat.

07:53.790 --> 07:56.240
Will you stop looking at my fingers?

07:57.500 --> 07:59.890
excuse me. Thank you.

07:59.900 --> 08:04.960
Oh,sweetie,I hate to be the one to tell you
this,but I think your mother's having an affair.

08:05.440 --> 08:08.800
Yeah. How cool is that?

08:11.370 --> 08:14.870
oh,my god. My mother's been
having an affair for years.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.460
Maybe not. I mean,maybe it's--
maybe it's something else.

08:17.470 --> 08:21.840
Yeah. No,you're right. I mean,maybe she's,like,turning
tricks to pay for her community college.

08:21.850 --> 08:25.410
Guys,this is gonna kill my father.

08:25.420 --> 08:28.040
Yoknow,my aunt found out that
my uncle was having an affair,

08:28.060 --> 08:31.360
and two weeks later,they found
her dead from a broken heart...

08:31.400 --> 08:33.770
and a boating accident.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.320
You know,maybe she is
telling the truth,though.

08:36.330 --> 08:38.990
Maybe cheese does make her bloat.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.830
I just need to know for sure.

08:40.850 --> 08:42.730
Oh,you could sprinkle
parmesan cheese,you know,so--

08:42.760 --> 08:44.660
about the affair,honey.

08:44.670 --> 08:46.690
okay,I was watching oprah last week,

08:46.700 --> 08:49.630
and she was talking about ways to
tell if someone's having an affair.

08:49.640 --> 08:51.130
Oh,my god. We both watch oprah.

08:51.140 --> 08:52.580
Oh,my god. We're twins!

08:52.590 --> 08:54.910
- The first sign is dieting.
- No.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.820
- I mean,she eats whatever she wants.
- Bitch.

08:56.830 --> 08:59.380
Hey,is she doing anything,you
know,differnt in bed?

08:59.390 --> 09:03.470
Actually,yeah,she's been doing this
new thing with her-- I don't know!

09:03.480 --> 09:05.430
Underwear. Underwear.

09:05.440 --> 09:07.600
Is she buying sexy lingerie?

09:07.610 --> 09:10.570
Andrea,what do you think I do,go
rifling through her underwear drawer?

09:14.590 --> 09:15.630
new.

09:16.330 --> 09:19.320
new. New... new. New.

09:19.330 --> 09:20.770
Samantha?

09:20.780 --> 09:22.430
Hey,dad.

09:22.440 --> 09:23.610
What up?

09:23.630 --> 09:25.830
What the hell is going on in here?

09:27.430 --> 09:30.280
you know,if I,uh,if I told you,I
don't think you'd be very happy.

09:30.290 --> 09:32.170
Well,I don't expect
things to make me happy.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.660
I'm from a different generation.

09:36.210 --> 09:37.410
I needed money.

09:37.420 --> 09:39.390
What for?

09:39.400 --> 09:42.560
The concert. Rock concert.

09:42.570 --> 09:45.730
Yeah,it's this great band.
They're,uh,they're called...

09:45.740 --> 09:47.070
"lancelot."

09:47.080 --> 09:49.850
They dress up like knights and stuff.

09:50.870 --> 09:52.820
- You wanna go?
- No.

09:52.830 --> 09:56.840
Just,um... clean up in here and...

09:56.850 --> 09:58.470
come down to nner.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.590
Yeah,it's funny. The--lancelot--
they have this song.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.180
It's called "come to
dinner. It's like...

10:02.190 --> 10:07.650
come to dinner in the
castle of our love...

10:18.090 --> 10:19.560
More meat loaf,regina?

10:19.590 --> 10:20.720
No,just salad.

10:20.730 --> 10:23.530
Oh,really? You dieting,perhaps?

10:23.540 --> 10:25.030
No,actually,I had a late lunch.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.200
Oh,really? How was it?

10:27.210 --> 10:28.520
Very tasty. I had orange roughy.

10:28.530 --> 10:30.330
Yeah,bet you like it rough-Y.

10:30.340 --> 10:31.510
What is the matter with you?

10:31.520 --> 10:33.100
Okay,enough.

10:33.120 --> 10:36.710
There's something going on under this roof
that's divided our family for a long time,

10:36.720 --> 10:38.860
and I am not going to
stand for it anymore.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.100
That's right. You tell her,pop.

10:41.110 --> 10:44.690
Regina,our daughter is a junkie.

10:44.720 --> 10:47.200
What? No,I am not.

10:47.210 --> 10:49.930
Yep. The first response
is always denial.

10:49.940 --> 10:53.110
But I caught her going through our
drawers looking for money to get her fix.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.620
That is so not true.

10:54.630 --> 10:57.100
Don't pretend you're going
to see that band lancelot,

10:57.120 --> 11:00.520
because according to the
internet,the band does not exist.

11:00.550 --> 11:03.680
That's right. I used the internet.

11:03.690 --> 11:04.950
I thought it might be drugs.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.720
That's probably what
caused your memory problem.

11:07.730 --> 11:10.080
I was hit by a car!

11:10.090 --> 11:12.390
Well,that's what happens when
you don't pay your dealer.

11:12.410 --> 11:14.510
Oh,for heaven sake!

11:16.560 --> 11:20.320
May I be excused? Thank you.

11:25.940 --> 11:30.280
It's not in my head,all right?
I saw my mother's panties.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.490
I'm gonna put my shirt on.
I'm starting to feel weird.

11:32.500 --> 11:36.210
I cannot believe that she is having an
affair with some man right here in this city.

11:36.230 --> 11:39.210
Yeah,I wonder if he's paying
$300 for a hotel room,too.

11:39.220 --> 11:41.610
Oh,I know. I know. I'm sorry.

11:41.620 --> 11:45.720
- Let's--we can just talk about
this later,okay? - All right.

11:49.220 --> 11:50.890
- I wonder what he looks like.
- okay,then.

11:50.900 --> 11:53.670
I'm sure he's latin and
all swarthy,you know,like...

11:53.680 --> 11:57.040
"come on,regina. Let me
make sweet love to you."

11:57.050 --> 11:58.040
That's not latin. That's french.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.610
I don't care. I'm not
calling him "daddy."

12:02.680 --> 12:04.550
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,todd.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.550
I just--I can't-- I
can't do this right now.

12:06.560 --> 12:10.020
I need to find out who
this guy is,all right?

12:10.030 --> 12:11.590
- Rain check?
- Yeah.

12:11.910 --> 12:13.380
Chocolate.

12:13.390 --> 12:15.760
And there's another 8 bucks.

12:21.970 --> 12:24.400
I've never followed anyone before.

12:24.410 --> 12:27.030
Well,once,but he wanted me to.

12:27.040 --> 12:31.480
I mean,he told me not
to,but he wanted me to.

12:33.690 --> 12:34.940
He's cute.

12:34.970 --> 12:38.510
Ooh,yes. If he came into my
coffee shop,I wold hire him.

12:38.520 --> 12:41.550
He could be our
barista,play spanish guitar.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.040
He can emcee on open mike night.

12:43.050 --> 12:45.240
We're not having an open mike night.

12:45.260 --> 12:46.960
you said "we"!

12:46.970 --> 12:49.300
God. I can't take this anymore.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.700
Mother!

12:54.630 --> 12:56.070
- Sorry.
- Sure.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.310
Ll,hello there,darling.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.270
Whatre you doing?

13:00.280 --> 13:03.700
Don't tell me that you're tasting cheese
or playing bridge-golf with the gals,

13:03.720 --> 13:06.170
because I know that
you are cheating on dad.

13:06.190 --> 13:07.290
Cheating?

13:07.300 --> 13:08.740
Come on,mom.

13:08.760 --> 13:13.940
The makeup,the new lingerie,the
boobs in the afternoon.

13:15.330 --> 13:18.480
I never could fool you,samantha.
You're a smart girl.

13:18.490 --> 13:21.700
That's my fault. I breast-fed you
the first four weeks of your life.

13:21.710 --> 13:24.420
So who is he? What's his name?

13:25.970 --> 13:27.210
rory.

13:27.230 --> 13:30.520
Rory? Rory?

13:30.530 --> 13:33.010
Kinda sounds like a dog throwing up.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.060
I realize you're good now,samantha,

13:35.070 --> 13:38.660
and you're no longer subject to
the temptations the rest of us feel,

13:38.670 --> 13:42.320
but don't you judge me for something
you've done a thousand times.

13:42.330 --> 13:44.500
I'll see you athome fodinner.

13:45.750 --> 13:48.610
I made scalloped potatoes.

13:57.160 --> 13:58.330
Now don't get all excited.

13:58.340 --> 14:00.590
It's not a marijuana plant.

14:01.110 --> 14:03.910
So,um...

14:04.720 --> 14:06.030
where's mom?

14:06.040 --> 14:08.060
I don't know. Upstairs?

14:08.070 --> 14:10.220
Yeah,she's-- e's
not upstairs,dad.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.650
She's not even here. Her car's gone.

14:12.660 --> 14:15.160
Oh,well,she's out then.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.740
See? This is the problem.

14:18.750 --> 14:21.860
You don't even know where
she is or who she's with.

14:21.880 --> 14:25.080
Or if they're latin or french or rory.

14:25.090 --> 14:26.760
Okay,I don't care how much it costs.

14:26.770 --> 14:28.970
We're getting you into a program.

14:28.980 --> 14:31.840
Dad,you two are living parallel lives.

14:31.880 --> 14:34.610
Sammy,your mother and i are just fine.

14:34.620 --> 14:39.050
When two people have been married as long as
we have,you learn to give each other space.

14:39.380 --> 14:41.970
You water a flower too much,it dies.

14:41.990 --> 14:45.650
Yeah,well,if you don't water it enough,it'll
find someone to have sex with who will.

14:45.660 --> 14:49.320
Oh,boy. sammy,flowers don't have sex.

14:49.330 --> 14:51.270
It's called cross-pollination.

14:51.280 --> 14:52.600
I got a "time life"
book. I'll show you--

14:52.610 --> 14:54.330
that's it.That's it. You know
what? You're coming with me.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.480
- Where are we going?
- There's something that you need to see,dad.

14:57.490 --> 14:59.850
- Okay,but we're taking my car.
- Fine.

14:59.860 --> 15:03.780
I'm not gonna get jacked holding some
ditch weed and a dub sack of kokomo.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.770
And no more internet!

15:10.150 --> 15:12.280
I'm so sorry,dad.

15:12.730 --> 15:14.900
I thought she had everything she needed.

15:14.920 --> 15:16.940
I mean,what kind of woman does this?

15:16.950 --> 15:20.000
You know,there's no parking
here,so why don't you just valet?

15:20.010 --> 15:23.120
I'm not gonna pay $5 for
parking. I'm mad enough.

15:23.130 --> 15:26.170
Now go inside,get your mother,because
if I see the man she's with,

15:26.180 --> 15:28.980
I'm gonna put my fist through his eye!

15:29.320 --> 15:31.320
I'm just gonna circle.

15:31.810 --> 15:33.430
all right.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.120
sam?

15:43.440 --> 15:44.380
What the hell are you doing here?

15:44.390 --> 15:46.310
You need to come outside
to the car right now.

15:46.330 --> 15:47.710
No,I'm not gonna leave here. You are.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.270
And we will talk about
this wh I go home.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.600
two,please.

15:50.620 --> 15:53.660
Do we look like we
work here,mister? Scoot.

15:54.840 --> 15:57.130
Right this way.

15:57.940 --> 15:59.620
You're not having an
affair? You're a waitress?

15:59.630 --> 16:00.970
Hostess. Thank you.

16:00.980 --> 16:01.880
Oh,what? No,no,no,no,no.

16:01.890 --> 16:05.360
You have to be having an affair,because--because
y-you're not wearing your wedding ring.

16:05.370 --> 16:07.030
Single girls get bigger tips.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.020
Okay,well,but then what about--
what about all that fancyew lingerie?

16:10.030 --> 16:13.160
Oh,well,because I'm your mother,I can't
wear a garter belt and occasional thong?

16:13.180 --> 16:14.850
No,no,you cannot.

16:14.860 --> 16:16.750
I'll see that you get some bread.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.260
A job? This is your big secret?

16:19.270 --> 16:22.080
Yes. Yes,it was.

16:22.090 --> 16:27.740
One thing in my life that I don't have
to account for to anyone-- it's just mine.

16:28.810 --> 16:31.270
Well,if you're gonna stay here,fold.

16:31.280 --> 16:34.230
I am part of a whole
different world here.

16:34.240 --> 16:36.830
Last week,I seated a guy from malaysia.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.270
When would I ever meet
people from malaysia?

16:39.280 --> 16:42.200
I mean,lord knows I'd never
set foot in that country.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.010
You ld me that you
were having an affair.

16:44.020 --> 16:46.100
I mean,you--you--you
lied.

16:46.110 --> 16:50.010
Because I knew if I told you I had
a job,you would tell your father.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.310
But you do not understand him.

16:53.320 --> 16:57.220
Know that man,and if he ever thought
that I needed to or even wanted to work,

16:57.230 --> 17:00.350
he would feel he had
failed me completely.

17:00.360 --> 17:04.990
So I let you think it was an affair,'cause
I knew you would never tell him that.

17:05.020 --> 17:07.849
I found a parking space.

17:09.450 --> 17:12.119
Well,it seems I'm still
getting to know you.

17:12.130 --> 17:13.359
All right,where is he,regina?

17:13.380 --> 17:15.770
Tell me where he is so I can rip
off his head and feed it to the dog!

17:15.780 --> 17:17.430
Howard. Howard,there isn't anybody here.

17:17.440 --> 17:19.569
Oh,yes,there is. Sammy
told me all about it.

17:19.579 --> 17:22.319
No,dad. I was wrong.

17:22.329 --> 17:24.410
Oh,so you're protecting him,too,huh?

17:24.420 --> 17:26.930
All right,I want the truth right now.

17:26.950 --> 17:30.320
Mom. Mom,just tell
him. He'll understand.

17:30.330 --> 17:33.460
Okay. Okay.

17:33.470 --> 17:35.900
Howard...

17:37.050 --> 17:40.220
I'm ashamed to say that i
was going to have an affair...

17:40.240 --> 17:41.860
But I sent him away.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.140
oh,for pete's sake.

17:43.150 --> 17:44.800
I-I just couldn't do it.

17:44.820 --> 17:47.140
I mean,there he was,sitting
across the table from me--

17:47.150 --> 17:50.800
ten years my junior,tall,athletic...

17:51.250 --> 17:53.680
boot-cut jeans.

17:53.690 --> 17:58.260
And I said,"no. No. I love my husband.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.990
"And if I have a problem,I'm gonna
go home,and I'm gonna deal with it."

18:02.980 --> 18:04.750
No.

18:05.100 --> 18:07.470
I'm gonna have to deal with it,regina.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.460
Sammy's right.

18:09.470 --> 18:11.690
I've been neglecting you.

18:15.450 --> 18:19.520
W-well,I didn't want to have to
be the one to say it,but,uh...

18:19.910 --> 18:22.660
maybe,uh,you know,a gift now and then?

18:22.670 --> 18:24.800
Anything.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.690
Two for lunch.

18:35.730 --> 18:37.860
right this way.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.860
Sammy's got a job.

18:47.390 --> 18:49.970
I hope they don't give her a urine test.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.980
Todd! Todd!

18:58.970 --> 19:00.790
Sam?

19:01.350 --> 19:03.590
wait. What are you doing
here? Chloe's upstairs.

19:03.600 --> 19:07.430
I know. That's what I
wanna talk to you about.

19:07.440 --> 19:10.970
I wanna be the one
upstairs,todd. You know?

19:10.980 --> 19:13.000
Not the one in plant.

19:13.020 --> 19:14.720
I want something stable,todd.

19:14.730 --> 19:17.020
I want something where the
people love each ther so much,

19:17.040 --> 19:20.730
they're--they're willing to--
to lie very bizarrely just to--

19:20.770 --> 19:22.560
just to protect eachther's feelings.

19:22.590 --> 19:25.310
I-I don't want to sneak around anymore.

19:25.320 --> 19:26.730
So you have to choose.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.560
It's either chloe or me.

19:28.570 --> 19:30.090
Wait. I was the
one who said--

19:31.470 --> 19:33.490
We talk too muc

19:33.580 --> 19:35.140
you.

19:40.600 --> 19:44.130
And you know,if I ever want
to work,then I am gonna work.

19:44.140 --> 19:46.240
You got that,bucko?

19:49.660 --> 19:51.270
wait.

19:59.050 --> 20:02.350
you know that thing about touching the
plate after the waiter tells you it's hot?

20:02.360 --> 20:05.510
The most exciting time is that
moment right before you touch it.

20:05.520 --> 20:09.760
After that,you're just an idiot sitting
in a restaurant with a burnt finger.

20:18.450 --> 20:19.840
hey,frank.

20:20.050 --> 20:21.770
Miss newly.

20:22.080 --> 20:23.860
Big ne.

20:24.190 --> 20:27.030
Todd is going to be my boyfriend.

20:27.900 --> 20:31.990
I guess the man's never heard the
phrase,"fool me twice,shame on me."

20:32.000 --> 20:35.150
oh,funny,funny frank.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.710
the truth is, one who's
had my share of meals,

20:40.720 --> 20:43.290
it's a lot more fun
when you're t in pain.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.960
* May the road rise with you *

20:45.970 --> 20:48.660
* may the road rise with you *

20:48.670 --> 20:50.520
* may the road rise with you *
