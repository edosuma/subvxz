WEBVTT

00:03.667 --> 00:05.417
Okay, everybody. Listen up.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.083
Now that we have the new baby,

00:07.166 --> 00:09.792
the Duncan's are not gonna be able to do
our summer vacation.

00:10.083 --> 00:11.166
All: Yes!

00:13.709 --> 00:15.500
Like we usually do.

00:16.500 --> 00:19.208
There's always more.
Why is there always more?

00:21.750 --> 00:23.291
So, the plan is

00:23.375 --> 00:25.250
to head up to the mountains
for a few days.

00:25.417 --> 00:26.375
Dad got a great deal.

00:26.458 --> 00:28.417
- Oh, no. This is bad.
- This should be good.

00:28.500 --> 00:29.375
Okay.

00:29.458 --> 00:32.959
I know I got a reputation for finding
less than stellar accommodations.

00:33.041 --> 00:34.375
But this time, it's gonna be great.

00:34.750 --> 00:37.875
We're gonna be staying in a beautiful,
rustic cabin on, uh...

00:38.875 --> 00:40.000
Dead Man's Lake.

00:42.875 --> 00:44.917
- What was that?
- Hmm? Um...

00:45.500 --> 00:46.792
Dead Man's Lake.

00:48.166 --> 00:51.250
Are... Are you trying to say
Dead Man's Lake?

00:51.375 --> 00:53.041
I'm trying not to, actually.

00:53.750 --> 00:54.625
Oh, come on, you guys.

00:54.709 --> 00:56.667
Once you get past the name,
the place is amazing.

00:56.917 --> 00:57.959
Dead Man's Lake?

00:58.041 --> 01:00.041
What, are we gonna catch some dead fish,

01:00.125 --> 01:02.166
or hike through some dead trees?

01:02.375 --> 01:03.208
Yeah.

01:03.291 --> 01:04.667
Climb on some dead rocks.

01:06.625 --> 01:08.250
Or live rocks, whatever.

01:10.625 --> 01:12.959
Now that I think about it,
that sounds really nice.

01:13.041 --> 01:14.125
And I for one,

01:14.208 --> 01:18.125
am looking forward to spending
some quality time with my family.

01:21.458 --> 01:22.709
We made a lot of kids, Bob.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.166
That one turned out good.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.333
Ivy, hi. Okay, so listen up.

01:29.458 --> 01:31.208
Big party at my house this weekend.

01:31.250 --> 01:33.375
My family's going away
and I'm gonna pretend to be sick.

01:33.458 --> 01:34.917
So get the word out that...

01:35.000 --> 01:39.500
The Duncan family
is going on a summer vacation.

01:41.834 --> 01:43.709
It was Ivy.
I was telling her about the big trip.

01:43.917 --> 01:45.458
Honey, thank you
for what you said in there.

01:45.542 --> 01:46.750
That was very sweet.

01:46.917 --> 01:48.959
Yeah, well, it needed to be said.

01:51.709 --> 01:53.041
Are you coming down with something?

01:53.333 --> 01:54.667
Oh, no. It's just a little tickle.

01:54.750 --> 01:56.667
I'm sure I will be fine for the weekend.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.333
Family fun! Yay!

02:00.542 --> 02:02.709

Water bottles, sun screen, bug repellant.

03:07.917 --> 03:11.041
Laptop, hand held, game controller.

03:12.542 --> 03:15.625
Guys. We're only going for three days.

03:15.709 --> 03:16.542
Three days?

03:17.375 --> 03:18.417
We're gonna need more games.

03:20.750 --> 03:21.875
Honey, where's Teddy?

03:21.959 --> 03:23.041
Here I am.

03:24.792 --> 03:25.959
Teddy, are you sick?

03:26.041 --> 03:28.542
Yes, and I was so looking forward to...

03:31.166 --> 03:33.125
...family vacation fun time.

03:34.250 --> 03:35.166
Oh.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.250
Bob, what are we gonna do?
Cancel the trip?

03:37.375 --> 03:39.417
Oh, no, no. You guys go.

03:39.500 --> 03:43.250
Ivy can come and stay with me,
and Mrs. Dabney's right next door.

03:43.333 --> 03:44.792
I don't... I don't know.

03:44.875 --> 03:46.709
Plus, I would hate to get the baby sick.

03:47.250 --> 03:48.375
That's a good point.

03:48.792 --> 03:49.834
Isn't it?

03:52.125 --> 03:55.083
Hey, we can keep an eye on her
with the home monitoring system.

03:55.166 --> 03:57.291
With... With the... With the what now?

03:57.375 --> 03:58.333
Bob: Yeah, no.

03:58.583 --> 04:01.500
Last week I did a pest control job
for a home security company.

04:01.583 --> 04:03.375
They gave me a system for free. Look.

04:04.625 --> 04:06.041
Got a camera right over there.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.542
So it's on all the time?

04:10.583 --> 04:11.667
Twenty-four-seven.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.125
So, while we're in the mountains,

04:13.208 --> 04:15.083
we can watch the feed
through Mom's computer.

04:15.166 --> 04:16.417
And keep an eye on you.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.000
Yay.

04:20.458 --> 04:22.667
Hey. Guys, come on, let's go!

04:23.083 --> 04:24.417
Bye-bye, Toby.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.917
Charlie, honey, the baby's coming with us.

04:28.375 --> 04:29.542
Oh, nuts.

04:31.166 --> 04:33.250
Um, where did you learn to say that?

04:33.333 --> 04:35.625
Oh, honey, baby needs a change.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.041
Oh, nuts.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.417
So that's it over there, huh?

04:45.542 --> 04:46.417
Teddy: Yup.

04:46.500 --> 04:51.375
Our new Security system,
also known as the Party Killer 9,000.

04:54.542 --> 04:55.458
Why 9,000?

04:56.125 --> 04:57.667
It's funnier with a number.

04:59.250 --> 05:00.125
Is it?

05:02.542 --> 05:04.250
So, will your parents be able to hear us?

05:04.333 --> 05:07.000
No, there's no sound.
They'll just be able to see us.

05:07.250 --> 05:08.875
Then I guess we gotta cancel the party.

05:09.166 --> 05:11.041
Wrong. I have a plan.

05:12.709 --> 05:14.166
And he's right on time.

05:17.458 --> 05:19.500
Victor. Come on in.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.041
Ivy, you know Victor.

05:22.125 --> 05:24.917
President of South High's
audio visual club.

05:25.291 --> 05:27.125
Thank you for using my full title.

05:28.417 --> 05:30.166
I don't always get the respect I deserve.

05:32.291 --> 05:33.417
This is your plan?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.208
Victor the loser?

05:37.583 --> 05:39.166
It's pronounced Deleseur.

05:40.834 --> 05:44.208
Victor, I wanted to invite you
to a party tonight.

05:44.625 --> 05:48.458
So, you, uh, finally got rid
of that dumb jock, Spencer?

05:49.875 --> 05:51.500
No. He's just out of town.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.041
Oh, please don't tell him I said that.

05:54.750 --> 05:57.458
Look, Victor.
We need some audio-visual help.

05:57.542 --> 05:59.250
Do you know anything about cameras?

06:01.083 --> 06:02.792
Do I know anything about cameras?

06:03.417 --> 06:05.417
Oh mahn dore tool-ee-ell lay?

06:07.375 --> 06:09.959
Oh, well, that's Elvish
for "From what land do you come?"

06:11.000 --> 06:12.166
Elvish?

06:12.250 --> 06:13.750
I slip into it when I'm excited.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.917
Oh, what I'm trying to say
is I know everything about cameras.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.500
Well, next time, just say it like that.

06:21.458 --> 06:22.375
I'll be right back.

06:22.458 --> 06:24.041
Wh... Where are you going?

06:24.125 --> 06:25.792
Well, to tell my mother
this wasn't a trap,

06:25.875 --> 06:27.458
and she may proceed back to home.

06:37.333 --> 06:38.667
All: Wow.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.041
Bob: Hey.

06:40.625 --> 06:42.333
I gotta hand it to you, Dad.

06:42.583 --> 06:44.333
This place is pretty nice.

06:44.417 --> 06:46.041
Oh. Hold that thought.

06:46.750 --> 06:47.834
Spooky portrait.

06:49.875 --> 06:52.959
Who cares about a stupid picture?
I think we can call this a win.

06:55.709 --> 06:57.083
Yep. The eyes follow you.

06:59.542 --> 07:01.542
Well, I think it's very nice.

07:01.834 --> 07:03.041
What do you think, Charlie?

07:03.125 --> 07:04.500
Why is Toby here?

07:06.542 --> 07:08.125
Okay, you really gotta let that go.

07:10.041 --> 07:11.458
Come on, let's go check out your room.

07:11.542 --> 07:12.375
Come on.

07:13.875 --> 07:16.625
Well, as long as the picture's
the only spooky thing about the place,

07:16.709 --> 07:17.667
I think we're good.

07:18.667 --> 07:20.208
Afternoon.

07:22.417 --> 07:23.375
Who are you?

07:24.083 --> 07:26.083
Name's Willard. I'm the caretaker.

07:26.792 --> 07:29.083
Been working here 30-odd years.

07:29.667 --> 07:31.333
And they have been odd.

07:32.875 --> 07:35.500
Okay. Well, we're the Duncans.

07:37.750 --> 07:38.583
Um...

07:39.166 --> 07:40.375
We're renting the place.

07:40.458 --> 07:43.542
Oh, surprised to hear
they're still renting it out after the...

07:43.917 --> 07:44.792
Incident.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.625
Incident? What incident?

07:48.542 --> 07:49.667
I've said too much.

07:50.792 --> 07:53.250
Could you at least tell me
what kind of incident it was?

07:53.792 --> 07:55.250
Happy incident, fun incident?

07:57.208 --> 07:58.667
Well, I'd better be going.

07:58.750 --> 08:00.417
Wait, wait. Before you go.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.375
Uh, do you know anything about this guy?

08:02.583 --> 08:03.500
Sure I do.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.709
Willard: That's Commodore
Elijah T. Deadman.

08:07.542 --> 08:09.333
That's why it's called Dead Man's Lake.

08:09.417 --> 08:11.250
- Oh.
- Actually, no relation.

08:13.583 --> 08:15.375
Well, enjoy your stay.

08:16.375 --> 08:17.667
If you can.

08:19.125 --> 08:21.083
If you can? What do you mean if you can?

08:21.375 --> 08:23.458
You seem a little tense.

08:23.792 --> 08:24.625
Here.

08:25.125 --> 08:26.041
This might help.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.041
A coupon for dead man's massage?

08:33.000 --> 08:34.250
Unfortunate name.

08:34.375 --> 08:35.458
Great value.

08:57.834 --> 08:58.792
Gabe?

08:59.709 --> 09:01.417
- Yeah?
- Stop messing with me.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.542
Stop? I haven't even started.

09:04.750 --> 09:06.000
You made all the drawers pop open.

09:06.333 --> 09:07.458
Why would I do that?

09:08.250 --> 09:09.667
Did the drawers hurt you in any way?

09:10.792 --> 09:11.709
No.

09:11.792 --> 09:13.250
Were you humiliated?

09:14.125 --> 09:15.000
No.

09:15.083 --> 09:16.792
Do you know anything about my work?

09:25.417 --> 09:27.041
Okay. Good fake sneeze.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.166
Now check your temperature.

09:30.250 --> 09:32.500
You've got a fever. Show me some concern!

09:33.000 --> 09:33.959
Oh!

09:34.375 --> 09:35.291
Ah!

09:36.000 --> 09:36.917
Ooh!

09:37.500 --> 09:38.625
Whoo!

09:39.417 --> 09:41.709
You're hot.
You're not going to burst into flames.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.959
Just trying to make it more interesting.

09:45.208 --> 09:47.375
No. We don't want it to be interesting.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.750
We're creating boring footage
of you being sick.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.709
Then I'll insert it into the video feed,

09:51.792 --> 09:53.917
and that's what your parents
will see while we're partying.

09:55.542 --> 09:56.917
That's pretty good, Victor.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.583
Excuse me?

09:59.166 --> 10:01.166
That's pretty good, Mr. President.

10:03.875 --> 10:05.250
Okay, Ivy. You're on.

10:05.709 --> 10:06.542
Okay.

10:09.125 --> 10:10.166
Now taste it.

10:11.417 --> 10:12.417
Mm!

10:13.208 --> 10:14.709
Mm-mm!

10:15.125 --> 10:17.458
You love the soup,
you're not in love with the soup.

10:18.458 --> 10:19.625
Don't we have enough video?

10:19.959 --> 10:20.792
And cut.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.917
Okay. Question about the party.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.250
What exactly happens at a party?

10:29.083 --> 10:30.875
Well, haven't you ever been to one?

10:31.166 --> 10:32.125
Nope.

10:32.208 --> 10:35.417
Although, the meetings of the AV Club
can be quite rambunctious.

10:37.458 --> 10:39.500
One time, Gary's Mother made popcorn!

10:44.000 --> 10:47.458
You know T. At some point,
we have to ask ourselves...

10:48.333 --> 10:49.291
Is it worth it?

11:00.083 --> 11:02.500
Charlie, you caught a fish!

11:02.583 --> 11:04.083
This is Daddy's.

11:05.917 --> 11:07.166
That one's mine.

11:11.375 --> 11:12.375
She's confused.

11:12.375 --> 11:13.542
No, I'm not.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.542
Okay.

11:16.625 --> 11:18.959
Why don't you run along now, okay?

11:21.250 --> 11:23.166
So, what you been up to, hon?

11:23.250 --> 11:27.250
Well, Toby's in the middle of a long nap,
and I have been enjoying this novel.

11:27.375 --> 11:29.166
"Breathless Eternity"?

11:30.250 --> 11:31.417
What's that about?

11:31.792 --> 11:34.709
Some hunky guy who lost his shirt.

11:35.792 --> 11:37.291
So, how's Teddy been doing?

11:37.375 --> 11:38.417
Let's find out.

11:43.709 --> 11:45.291
Amy: Oh, poor girl.

11:45.375 --> 11:46.750
She looks miserable.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.291
Yeah, uh-huh!

11:51.375 --> 11:53.375
Whoo! Yeah!

11:53.583 --> 11:56.458
Yeah! I feel like Victor the winner!

12:20.834 --> 12:22.917
- What are you doing?
- Putting two and two together.

12:23.125 --> 12:24.458
How long you been working on it?

12:27.792 --> 12:30.583
The spooky portrait,
the drawers that open by themselves,

12:30.709 --> 12:32.375
the freaky caretaker...

12:33.208 --> 12:35.458
Don't laugh at me,
but I think this house is haunted.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.333
Dude! I said don't laugh at me.

12:41.583 --> 12:43.041
That wasn't me.

12:43.750 --> 12:45.583
When I laugh at you, it sounds like this.

12:47.709 --> 12:48.542
Right?

12:48.625 --> 12:49.625
So who was that?

12:50.041 --> 12:51.250
I... I don't know.

12:52.166 --> 12:53.125
Maybe it's just the wind.

12:53.542 --> 12:55.542
All right? Hey, you know what
will make you feel better?

12:55.625 --> 12:57.917
If we build a nice, cheerful fire.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.500
Fire's good.
Fire will ward off evil spirits.

13:00.583 --> 13:02.458
- Right.
- Plus we can make S'mores.

13:04.959 --> 13:06.458
Hey, hand me that old newspaper.

13:06.959 --> 13:07.875
Look at this.

13:08.375 --> 13:09.875
"Murders at local house".

13:11.083 --> 13:13.000
It's this house.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.333
There were murders here.

13:17.542 --> 13:18.458
Give me that.

13:19.875 --> 13:21.667
"The Sheriff
made a gruesome discovery today

13:21.750 --> 13:23.959
when the bodies of a vacationing couple

13:24.041 --> 13:25.875
were found at a cabin on Dead Man's Lake."

13:25.959 --> 13:28.041
I knew there was something
wrong with this house.

13:28.417 --> 13:30.625
It's a murder house. Thank you, Dad.

13:32.250 --> 13:33.250
Just calm down.

13:33.583 --> 13:36.083
Just because there was
a murder here before,

13:36.166 --> 13:37.625
doesn't mean there's gonna be more.

13:39.083 --> 13:40.083
Tell him that.

13:50.333 --> 13:51.667
Bob: PJ, Gabe.

13:51.750 --> 13:53.291
It knows our names!

13:55.500 --> 13:57.166
It's Dad! The murderer's Dad!

13:57.959 --> 14:00.709
Hey, what the heck is wrong with you two?

14:01.667 --> 14:03.542
I'm just chopping some firewood.

14:03.625 --> 14:05.875
Dad, there were murders in this house.

14:05.959 --> 14:07.542
- Look at the newspaper.
- Where's the paper?

14:07.625 --> 14:08.834
The newspaper's gone!

14:09.083 --> 14:10.834
The newspaper's... Oh, there it is.

14:12.041 --> 14:14.500
Would you please calm down?

14:14.583 --> 14:16.625
There is nothing to be afraid of.

14:17.375 --> 14:18.959
Evening..

14:19.041 --> 14:22.291
Jeez! You've got to stop doing that.

14:23.291 --> 14:26.417
Just came to check
and see if you were still here.

14:26.917 --> 14:27.959
Why wouldn't we be?

14:28.125 --> 14:29.041
No reason.

14:30.250 --> 14:31.083
Goodnight, now.

14:31.625 --> 14:33.917
Wait. Do you know anything about this?

14:34.333 --> 14:35.208
The murders?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.792
Yeah. They were never solved.

14:38.583 --> 14:40.667
Most people up here
think the killer was...

14:42.834 --> 14:43.917
I've said too much.

14:44.458 --> 14:47.625
You never say enough.
Please, finish your sentences.

14:49.333 --> 14:52.625
Some folks think the killer
is the angry spirit of...

14:52.875 --> 14:55.917
Commodore Elijah T. Deadman.

15:00.792 --> 15:02.917
Of course other folks
have a different theory.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.542
Okay. What's that?

15:04.792 --> 15:05.792
That it's me.

15:15.834 --> 15:21.000
Well, Shaggy and Scooby are convinced
the house is haunted by a killer ghost.

15:22.583 --> 15:23.875
Bob, come here. Look at this.

15:26.834 --> 15:28.375
Ivy's giving Teddy soup.

15:29.458 --> 15:30.333
So?

15:30.667 --> 15:33.583
So, she's given her soup
three times in the last hour.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.250
It's like it's on a continuous loop.

15:35.667 --> 15:36.917
You think Teddy's up to something?

15:37.250 --> 15:38.250
She's my daughter.

15:39.083 --> 15:40.417
I know she's up to something.

15:41.500 --> 15:45.166
Of course, she's your daughter, too,
so she shouldn't be able to pull it off.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.375
Hey. Teddy's not picking up.

15:52.166 --> 15:53.625
You know what? I have a better idea.

15:56.542 --> 15:58.959
Hi, Mrs. Dabney, it's Amy Duncan.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.375
No, don't hang up.

16:12.959 --> 16:14.834
Guys, quiet. Guys.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.792
Hi, Mrs. Dabney. What's up?

16:30.291 --> 16:32.542
Your Mother called
and asked me to check on you.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.000
Said you were sick.

16:34.083 --> 16:35.417
Oh.

16:35.917 --> 16:37.875
Yeah, I've got a really bad cold.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.291
So you put on a party dress?

16:41.875 --> 16:43.500
It always cheers me up.

16:44.959 --> 16:46.208
You know what cheers me up?

16:47.083 --> 16:49.000
Busting kids who lie to their parents.

16:51.417 --> 16:52.750
Really? That cheers you up?

16:53.125 --> 16:54.333
We all have our things.

16:56.375 --> 16:57.959
Okay, Mrs. Dabney.

16:58.417 --> 16:59.750
You got me. What are you gonna do?

17:00.000 --> 17:04.792
Lucky for you, there's one thing
I like more than busting kids.

17:05.166 --> 17:07.166
- What's that?
- Getting my party on.

17:08.792 --> 17:10.083
Okay, so...

17:10.166 --> 17:13.500
If I invite you to the party,
this stays between us?

17:13.834 --> 17:14.917
You got a deal.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.375
Ah, come on in.

17:16.458 --> 17:19.375
Let me call your mother
and tell her everything's okay.

17:19.458 --> 17:21.333
Then I'll be back. Oh, one question...

17:21.625 --> 17:23.834
Are kids these days
still doing "The Hustle"?

17:24.000 --> 17:24.834
What's that?

17:25.041 --> 17:27.125
Mmm. You are in for a treat.

17:33.500 --> 17:36.542
Well, thank you very much
for checking Mrs. Dabney.

17:36.625 --> 17:38.792
I'm... I'm sorry to have bothered you.

17:40.792 --> 17:42.834
I don't get it,
she said Teddy was laying on the couch,

17:42.917 --> 17:44.041
sick as a dog.

17:44.542 --> 17:45.583
That's nice.

17:48.417 --> 17:49.417
Hi, Mommy.

17:50.959 --> 17:52.041
May we help you?

17:54.500 --> 17:57.792
Charlie got scared,
and thought it would be a good idea

17:57.875 --> 17:59.458
if we all came and slept with you.

17:59.542 --> 18:00.625
No, I didn't.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.625
She's embarrassed.

18:08.709 --> 18:10.542
Okay, just for a little while.

18:15.709 --> 18:16.667
Hey!

18:16.750 --> 18:19.417
Why do little knees always find that spot?

18:19.500 --> 18:21.375
Oh.

18:27.125 --> 18:28.625
Is this a great party or what?

18:29.834 --> 18:31.041
No, really. I'm asking.

18:32.291 --> 18:33.625
I have no frame of reference.

18:35.709 --> 18:37.333
Hey, where's Mrs. Dabney?

18:37.417 --> 18:38.959
I thought she was
supposed to be coming over?

18:39.542 --> 18:41.041
Maybe she couldn't find something to wear.

18:49.709 --> 18:51.542
Where's your turntable?
I'm ready to Boogie!

19:03.208 --> 19:04.333
Okay, what was that?

19:04.417 --> 19:05.375
It's the ghost.

19:05.458 --> 19:07.041
- Or the killer.
- Or the killer ghost.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.291
Or the ghost killer.

19:11.500 --> 19:12.542
Bob, wake up.

19:12.625 --> 19:15.000
I'm up! I'm up. I'm up.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.166
Bob, Bob, turn on the lights.

19:21.417 --> 19:23.709
They don't work.

19:23.792 --> 19:24.750
Question.

19:25.250 --> 19:27.625
Was that wall dripping
red ooze this afternoon?

19:32.291 --> 19:33.417
Follow up question...

19:37.250 --> 19:39.542
does anyone else see
the floating candelabra?

19:40.750 --> 19:42.667
Man: Get out!

19:43.375 --> 19:46.125
Get out!

19:52.083 --> 19:54.208
Last summer it was us.

19:54.291 --> 19:57.500
Now it's your turn.

20:03.583 --> 20:04.625
He's got a knife!

20:04.875 --> 20:06.959
Man: You're all gonna die.

20:08.625 --> 20:12.291
When you learn you're on "Scary House".

20:15.041 --> 20:16.375
What's going on?

20:16.458 --> 20:20.041
"Scary House".
America's favorite new reality show.

20:20.125 --> 20:23.250
Where we take an average family,
and convince them they're staying

20:23.333 --> 20:24.917
in a haunted house.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.792
This was all a prank?

20:28.375 --> 20:29.625
That's terrible.

20:29.959 --> 20:31.333
You made us look like fools.

20:31.417 --> 20:32.917
You people are disgusting.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.959
We're gonna be on TV, you say?

20:44.333 --> 20:46.250
When the Duncans checked
into "Scary House,"

20:46.333 --> 20:49.291
they had no idea what they were in for.

20:53.750 --> 20:56.458
Wow, Mom. That was quite a scream.

20:56.709 --> 20:58.041
Yeah, that was PJ.

21:01.208 --> 21:03.375
And if you wanna see something
really scary,

21:03.458 --> 21:07.166
check out what we saw
on Mama Duncan's laptop.

21:18.291 --> 21:19.333
What was that?

21:21.458 --> 21:22.458
Um...

21:22.542 --> 21:24.125
That is called "The Hustle".

21:24.208 --> 21:26.875
It was a very popular
dance move in the 1970s.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.500
And what was it doing in our living room?

21:30.583 --> 21:32.834
Look, Mom. I don't have time
for all these questions.

21:32.917 --> 21:35.291
Because I have to do my video diary.

21:37.375 --> 21:39.834
Hi, Charlie.
Well, we have had quite a weekend.

21:39.917 --> 21:42.583
But you know what? It's all behind us now,
so why don't we just forget it

21:42.667 --> 21:44.458
and move on with our lives.

21:46.709 --> 21:51.000
Some of us won't be moving on
with anything for the next two weeks.

21:52.166 --> 21:53.125
- Me?
- Yeah.

21:53.875 --> 21:55.041
Can you dig it?

21:57.458 --> 21:58.750
Wish her good luck, Charlie.

22:04.875 --> 22:06.458
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

22:09.542 --> 22:11.375
How much longer is this gonna go on?

22:14.291 --> 22:15.375
What are we going to do?

22:15.458 --> 22:17.667
Well, there's only one thing to do.

22:24.583 --> 22:26.667
Ah! That's it. Get your groove on.

22:30.333 --> 22:31.583
Far out, man.

22:32.208 --> 22:33.083
I can dig it.

22:36.917 --> 22:38.291
- Howdy, folks...
- Oh!
