01:42.000 --> 01:43.666
- Hello!
-  Hi!

01:43.666 --> 01:46.500
Hello, Presleys. I'm Barbara.

01:46.500 --> 01:47.791
So nice to meet you.

01:47.791 --> 01:49.500
Nice to meet you!

01:49.500 --> 01:51.458
I know. I know it's a little rough,

01:51.458 --> 01:54.333
but nothing
a little landscaping couldn't fix, right?

01:55.625 --> 01:57.500
- What about this porch?
-  Yeah.

01:57.500 --> 02:00.125
Huh? Original everything.

02:01.083 --> 02:03.416
-  Everyone here?
-  Uh-huh.

02:03.416 --> 02:04.333
Ready?

02:04.333 --> 02:05.833
- Yeah. Let's see it.
- Okay.

02:11.750 --> 02:12.875
Everything okay?

02:13.416 --> 02:16.833
Oh! Yes! Come in. Come in!

02:19.125 --> 02:21.083
Cleaning crew can't come until Tuesday.

02:21.583 --> 02:22.583
As you can see,

02:24.125 --> 02:26.583
the home has tons of old-world charm.

02:27.791 --> 02:30.291
The house was built in 1904.

02:30.291 --> 02:34.333
It's registered with the Illinois
Historic Preservation Society.

02:34.333 --> 02:36.208
Instant value added.

02:36.208 --> 02:38.958
And look at all the gorgeous...

02:41.541 --> 02:42.375

02:59.250 --> 03:00.375

03:01.083 --> 03:02.291
Do I have to?

03:02.291 --> 03:03.666
Yes, you have to.

03:38.041 --> 03:39.750
Tons of closet space, huh?

03:41.083 --> 03:45.083
Primary bath, original fixtures and tile.

03:45.083 --> 03:48.375
Oh! And have you noticed
the high ceilings? I mean...

03:49.250 --> 03:50.958
The house is just listed really low.

03:51.916 --> 03:54.583
And I know it's a fixer-upper, but still...

03:54.583 --> 03:58.666
- Nothing, like, bad happened here, right?

03:59.833 --> 04:02.083
Oh my...

04:03.875 --> 04:07.291
Oh my gosh, no.
It's just a buyer's market.

06:09.875 --> 06:11.166
Got ya, bitch.

06:11.166 --> 06:13.583
- Ha, ha, ha. You got me. Ha.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.541
- Were you there the whole time?
- Yeah.

06:17.541 --> 06:19.583
- Oh my God.
- It took you long enough.

06:19.583 --> 06:21.958
Got me messing up my drip
with all this dust.

06:23.916 --> 06:26.041
...little work, yard work
or anything like that.

06:26.041 --> 06:28.000
You know what I'm saying? Oh!

06:29.625 --> 06:31.916
Think we're gonna move here?

06:31.916 --> 06:33.458
Hell no, man.

06:33.458 --> 06:34.708
This place is a dump.

06:36.916 --> 06:39.125
Watch your right side.
Come in tight!

06:40.416 --> 06:42.250
No, no, no. Turn more.

06:42.250 --> 06:43.750
Hey, wait! No, no, no!

06:44.833 --> 06:47.166
Hey, watch it! You hit the mailbox, man!

06:56.791 --> 07:00.083
There's ten more of those on the truck,
and they ain't moving themselves.

07:05.041 --> 07:05.958
Funny.

07:21.958 --> 07:23.083
Oi, Joy!

07:42.291 --> 07:43.583
Nasty.

07:44.166 --> 07:46.583
Nasty. Nasty.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.750
- Nasty. Nasty.

07:50.416 --> 07:51.833
Nasty.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.208
Ooh.

07:58.333 --> 07:59.458
What are you doing?

08:02.875 --> 08:04.833
Oh yeah.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.416
Come on.

08:09.375 --> 08:11.708
- It's a dance party, man.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.291
Pick something good.

08:13.291 --> 08:15.625
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.541
Come on, man. It's a dance party, Kev.

08:17.541 --> 08:19.625
Remember you used to dance
with your old man? Come on.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.375
-  Show me some of them moves.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.583
Come on. Look! Come on.

08:31.750 --> 08:32.750
Come on, man.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.291
I'm good, Dad. Thanks.

08:36.875 --> 08:39.791

08:46.625 --> 08:48.083
What the hell? Give me my phone!

08:48.083 --> 08:49.375
- After dinner.
- Mom!

08:49.375 --> 08:52.250
- I'm not getting in the middle of this.
- Yeah, of course not.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.041
Come on, Frank. Give me a break.

09:06.458 --> 09:10.625
So, what? You'd rather listen
to some old white dude play guitar?

09:12.041 --> 09:14.416
Terry Kath is one of the greatest
guitarists of all time.

09:14.416 --> 09:16.208
"Terry Kath
is one the greatest..."

09:16.208 --> 09:19.250
That's not true.
Jimi Hendrix is the greatest.

09:19.250 --> 09:21.000
Oh. Did you read that in <i>Rolling Stone?</i>

09:21.000 --> 09:23.083
No, it's a fact. Ask anybody.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.875
Or just ask Jimi Hendrix himself.

09:24.875 --> 09:27.541
He said Kath was his greatest inspiration.

09:27.541 --> 09:28.541
He was a genius.

09:28.541 --> 09:31.500
The dude accidentally
shot himself in the face.

09:31.500 --> 09:32.750
A genius he is not.

09:32.750 --> 09:35.833
Says the guy
reading a book for dummies.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
You know what?

09:52.375 --> 09:54.208
I'm sorry you're so unhappy.

09:55.458 --> 09:56.458
Okay?

09:56.458 --> 09:59.625
Now, we're all here
trying to get a fresh start.

10:01.333 --> 10:04.291
I'd appreciate it if you'd come at it
with a little bit more positivity.

10:04.875 --> 10:07.000
How many fresh starts are we at now, Dad?

10:08.666 --> 10:09.750
I lost count.

10:28.041 --> 10:28.916
What the hell, man?

10:30.541 --> 10:31.458
What?

10:32.791 --> 10:33.625
He started it.

12:53.583 --> 12:55.166
No, no, no. Wait. Don't go!

12:55.750 --> 12:56.875
Shit.

12:59.833 --> 13:01.291
Holy shit.

13:11.333 --> 13:14.375
"Most entities have been
displaced by trauma."

13:14.375 --> 13:15.416
Psst!

13:16.166 --> 13:17.166
Hey!

13:17.666 --> 13:18.791
Yeah, you.

13:19.375 --> 13:21.250
Can you come in
and guard the door for a sec?

13:21.750 --> 13:22.875
Come on.

13:30.083 --> 13:31.083
Um...

13:32.250 --> 13:34.583
I don't think
you're supposed to be doing that.

13:34.583 --> 13:36.625
Some racist douchebag
wrote my number down.

13:36.625 --> 13:39.541
I keep getting text messages
asking for free rice.

13:39.541 --> 13:40.750
- Free rice?

13:41.416 --> 13:43.666
Oh! You don't know?

13:43.666 --> 13:46.500
Asian people only eat rice.

13:48.041 --> 13:49.291
Why not just change your number?

13:49.291 --> 13:52.000
So, I should cave under the pressure
of institutionalized abuse?

13:52.000 --> 13:52.958
Uh, no. I meant--

13:52.958 --> 13:55.666
Besides, do you know
how clutch this number is?

13:55.666 --> 13:57.250
222-POOP.

13:57.250 --> 14:00.708
Phone numbers that good
are, like, impossible to get.

14:00.708 --> 14:03.666
So, uh, I... I think we're neighbors.

14:03.666 --> 14:04.791
We are?

14:05.291 --> 14:06.541
Yeah. Um...

14:06.541 --> 14:09.041
My family just moved
into the house next to yours.

14:09.041 --> 14:11.166
You moved into the House of Death?

14:12.083 --> 14:14.125
- House of what?
- Everyone says it's haunted.

14:14.125 --> 14:16.958
I'm an atheist, so I'm not
supposed to believe in that kind of shit,

14:16.958 --> 14:20.375
but secretly, I'd love to die
and then, I don't know,

14:20.375 --> 14:23.000
come back as some fierce ghost
and haunt Ted Cruz.

14:24.083 --> 14:25.125
Anyway.

14:25.916 --> 14:30.541
Uh... Neighbor, we should hang.
What are you doing after school?

14:31.333 --> 14:32.791
Oh, um... After school...

14:32.791 --> 14:35.875
Well, I, um...
I have a lot... I have to study.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.791
- That's one thing I have to do, study.
- Cool.

14:38.791 --> 14:43.250
Okay, well, uh, I guess you know my number
in case you change your mind.

14:43.958 --> 14:45.500
Or if you need rice.

15:01.791 --> 15:02.958
Oh, what's with that face?

15:02.958 --> 15:05.041
-  How was your ride home?
- Great.

15:05.041 --> 15:07.125
How about you, Kevin?
How was your ride home?

15:07.125 --> 15:08.041
Good.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.125
- Fulton, give me your phone.
- Why?

15:10.125 --> 15:12.916
Susan said she saw your brother
walk to school this morning.

15:12.916 --> 15:14.708
You had one job.

15:14.708 --> 15:15.958
That's bullshit.

15:15.958 --> 15:16.916
Kevin.

15:17.666 --> 15:18.583
No comment.

15:26.208 --> 15:27.083
Hello?

15:32.833 --> 15:34.125
It's me again.

Stop.

16:20.875 --> 16:22.125
It's not happening, bro.

16:23.708 --> 16:26.166
Listen, I know it... it probably worked
on everyone else before,

16:26.166 --> 16:29.708
but my personal life is, like,
1,000 times scarier than this.

16:34.875 --> 16:35.958
Sit down.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.208
Come on.

16:59.583 --> 17:00.708
Cool shirt.

17:01.541 --> 17:05.250
I've only been bowling once
when I was, like, eight.

17:05.875 --> 17:08.541
My dad got into a fistfight
with the guy in the lane next to us

17:08.541 --> 17:10.375
over an order of buffalo wings.

17:11.125 --> 17:13.750
Manager threw my whole family out.
They banned us for life.

17:17.583 --> 17:18.416
Can you talk?

17:21.291 --> 17:23.958
Just moans and groans?

17:28.958 --> 17:31.958
Did you, like, die here?

17:34.208 --> 17:35.041
In this house?

17:38.541 --> 17:39.708
You don't remember?

17:43.458 --> 17:44.791
Do you remember anything?

17:51.791 --> 17:53.083
So,

17:53.875 --> 17:54.916
it's Ernest, right?

17:55.500 --> 17:56.833
The name on your shirt.

18:00.041 --> 18:00.875
I'm Kevin.

18:08.666 --> 18:10.500
- Whoa.

18:12.958 --> 18:13.791
That's so trippy.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.083
Nice to meet you, Ernest.

18:28.875 --> 18:29.750
So...

18:31.708 --> 18:35.500
we can't touch you, but you can touch us?

18:37.875 --> 18:38.791
Hmm.

18:40.083 --> 18:42.208
Kind of like a stripper.

18:44.583 --> 18:45.500

18:46.000 --> 18:47.250
I need your phone.

18:47.791 --> 18:49.541
Jeez, it's freezing in here, man.

18:50.875 --> 18:53.333
Yo, butt munch. Your phone, come on.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.583
Why? Why do you need my phone?

18:54.583 --> 18:57.875
Because, unlike you, I have friends.
It's your fault Mom took my phone away.

18:57.875 --> 19:00.208
Um, I didn't drop me
a mile away from school.

19:00.208 --> 19:02.708
- Okay, where is it? Right there? Where?
- No. Fulton.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.291

19:37.666 --> 19:38.500
What?

19:41.333 --> 19:44.041

to be in a good mood?

19:44.041 --> 19:46.333
You can be in whatever mood you want.
You know.

- We can't tell her about this.
- Why not?

22:17.166 --> 22:20.250
she knew it meant to do her harm."

22:20.250 --> 22:22.750
"In one sudden motion, it launched,

22:22.750 --> 22:25.250
covering her mouth, stopping the scream."

22:25.250 --> 22:27.041
"It smelled of peppermint and rot."

22:27.041 --> 22:27.958
Sh!

22:27.958 --> 22:30.833
"The world started spinning
before she blacked out."

22:31.333 --> 22:34.875
"When she finally awakened,
the entity was gone."

22:35.458 --> 22:37.041
"Of course, no one believed her."

22:37.041 --> 22:38.500
"She was a child."

22:38.500 --> 22:41.916
"It was just a dream.
An overactive imagination."

22:42.750 --> 22:44.625
"But the little girl knew the truth."

22:45.583 --> 22:49.291
"The spirit realm is real,
and it is dangerous."

22:54.916 --> 22:55.875
Thank you.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.916
Nobody believed me either.

22:57.916 --> 22:59.458
My ghost is still with me.

22:59.458 --> 23:02.750
He followed me home
from a Red Lobster six years ago,

23:02.750 --> 23:04.333
and I can't seem to shake him.

23:04.333 --> 23:05.708
Now, I have tried to--

23:05.708 --> 23:09.041
Excuse me! I'm having a conversation here!

23:10.708 --> 23:13.833
He's very possessive and a homosexual.

23:15.083 --> 23:16.375
I am so tired.

23:18.541 --> 23:19.541
Thank you.

23:21.458 --> 23:23.000
Oh God, please.

23:26.291 --> 23:27.416
Hi.

23:27.416 --> 23:29.916
Hey, have you seen that viral video
that's been going around?

23:29.916 --> 23:32.958
I don't do social media.
It makes me nauseous.

23:32.958 --> 23:34.750
Well, guy finds a ghost in his attic.

23:34.750 --> 23:38.083
And I don't know.
I mean, it looks... it looks pretty legit.

23:38.083 --> 23:41.000
They always are until they aren't.

23:46.458 --> 23:48.125
Oh, this... this isn't my book.

23:51.916 --> 23:52.750
Mm.

23:52.750 --> 23:54.083
It has over a thousand views.

23:54.083 --> 23:56.541
- Is that good?
-  Don't quit your day job.

24:02.750 --> 24:05.541
"Cool graphics.
What are you using? Maya or ZBrush?"

24:05.541 --> 24:08.625
"Lame-balls. I've seen better stuff
on <i>Ghost Hunters."</i>

24:08.625 --> 24:10.416
- What?
- They think this is fake.

24:10.416 --> 24:11.625
Yeah, but it's real.

24:13.708 --> 24:16.625
Frank. Are you guys watching dirty stuff?
What are you watching?

24:16.625 --> 24:18.916
- Nothing.
- Dad posted a video of-- Ugh!

24:18.916 --> 24:21.083
- Fulton, I just bought those oranges!
-  God!

24:21.708 --> 24:23.875
Worried about the oranges. Cool.

24:23.875 --> 24:26.333
Organic fruit is expensive.
You guys are up to something.

24:26.333 --> 24:27.541
No, we're not.

24:27.541 --> 24:29.541
- Nothing.
- Hmm. Fishy, fishy.

24:35.958 --> 24:37.083
Snitches get stitches.

24:39.875 --> 24:41.333
- Let's do this.
- Yeah.

25:10.750 --> 25:11.666
Hello?

25:14.041 --> 25:15.458
We don't mean you any harm.

25:16.041 --> 25:18.708
Wikia says you should speak
in a firm, commanding voice

25:18.708 --> 25:20.208
so the ghost knows you're in charge.

25:20.208 --> 25:21.125
Got it.

25:22.333 --> 25:23.916
Spirit of this house!

25:24.541 --> 25:26.000
- Show yourself!
- Yeah.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.291
- Huh?

25:30.541 --> 25:31.500
Dad, look.

25:41.916 --> 25:43.000
Boo.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.500
Oh my gosh.

25:44.500 --> 25:45.583
It's not funny, man.

25:45.583 --> 25:46.958
It's totally funny.

25:46.958 --> 25:48.666
You're gonna scare it away, dumbass.

25:48.666 --> 25:51.750
No. Your patronizing, crappy
exorcist act is scaring it away.

25:55.250 --> 25:56.083
Hey.

25:57.833 --> 25:58.750
It's me again.

25:59.500 --> 26:04.041
This is my... my dad, Frank,
and my brother, Fulton.

26:04.541 --> 26:05.500
What's up?

26:07.750 --> 26:09.041
They wanna meet you.

26:17.250 --> 26:18.250
Lame.

26:18.250 --> 26:19.833
You know what? Hold on.

26:20.500 --> 26:21.458
I have an idea.

26:22.083 --> 26:23.125
Where are you going?

26:23.125 --> 26:24.583
He said he has an idea.

26:25.583 --> 26:27.958
What? He's gonna get the ghost
and bring him back up here?

26:30.416 --> 26:32.416
Oh, look at this fool.

26:32.416 --> 26:33.625
Shut up, dog face.

26:33.625 --> 26:35.750
I actually have a pretty attractive face.
Ask anybody.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.083
Hey. Let him play.

Hey, it's okay.

27:31.166 --> 27:32.208
All good, see?

27:53.166 --> 27:54.000
Ask him something.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.833
- He can't talk.
- Why not?

27:58.333 --> 27:59.708
I don't know. 'Cause he's a ghost.

28:00.291 --> 28:02.041
-  Frank!
-  Oh shit!

28:02.041 --> 28:03.583
He has to go. Hey, uh...

28:03.583 --> 28:05.708
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!

28:06.291 --> 28:07.208
 Frank.

28:09.958 --> 28:11.500
- Uh...

28:13.625 --> 28:15.958
- Uh--
- Really? Gonna act like we don't know?

28:15.958 --> 28:19.541
Hmm? 'Cause that's our house. Right?

28:22.083 --> 28:23.833
And that's his voice
behind the camera, right?

28:23.833 --> 28:25.750
- I... I, uh--
- You what?

28:25.750 --> 28:28.291
- Uh...
- You what, Frank? What?

28:43.791 --> 28:46.916
26,000 views in less than five minutes.
This is huge.

28:46.916 --> 28:49.708
- I saw it with my own eyes, Barbara.

28:49.708 --> 28:52.083
<i>Sweetie, I'm sure you think you did.</i>

28:52.083 --> 28:54.833
<i>My daughter Carly took a Xanax
with a bottle of Pinot Grigio</i>

28:54.833 --> 28:56.166
<i>and thought she was Edith Piaf.</i>

28:56.166 --> 28:59.125
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm not on drugs. We have proof.

28:59.125 --> 29:01.083
There's footage online.

29:01.083 --> 29:03.625
- Hey, where do you think you're going?
- Out?

29:03.625 --> 29:05.375
- Uh, no. Not so fast.
- Mom!

29:05.375 --> 29:08.541
Barbara, I'm pretty sure you broke
some kind of non-disclosure laws here.

29:08.541 --> 29:11.291
<i>We don't have to disclose ghosts.
Not in the fine print.</i>

29:11.291 --> 29:14.083
Oh! Well, then you'll be hearing
from our lawyer.

29:14.083 --> 29:16.250
- We have a lawyer?
- Of course not. We're broke.

29:16.250 --> 29:18.083
- 27,000!
- Can I go?

29:18.083 --> 29:20.291
No! You were in on this whole thing!

29:20.291 --> 29:22.041
Dad made us promise.

29:22.041 --> 29:22.958
Oh my God. Frank.

29:22.958 --> 29:24.958
- I knew you were gonna freak out.
- Yes!

29:24.958 --> 29:27.666
Any rational human being would!

29:27.666 --> 29:30.083
We have a ghost in our attic!

29:30.083 --> 29:32.875
- Mel, I'm sorry. I should've--
- And then to hear it from someone else?

29:32.875 --> 29:37.208
Somebody who saw it on freaking YouTube?
What happened to communicating more?

29:37.791 --> 29:41.208
Wasn't that the point of sitting through
20 sessions with Dr. Mouth-breather?

29:41.208 --> 29:43.458
- Okay. I'm out.
- Kevin.

29:43.458 --> 29:46.083
30,000. I'm so getting laid for this.

29:46.083 --> 29:48.333
- Fulton!
- Get out of here.

29:53.416 --> 29:54.250
Mel, I'm sorry.

29:54.833 --> 29:57.166
- We are moving.
- No. Wait, no. No, no, no.

29:57.166 --> 29:58.791
- Wait, wait, wait.
- No. No, no, no, no.

29:58.791 --> 29:59.833
We are not gonna be like

29:59.833 --> 30:04.208
every stupid white family
in every horror film. We are leaving.

30:04.208 --> 30:06.375
Will you just hear me out? Please, listen.

30:08.083 --> 30:08.958
Mel.

30:11.083 --> 30:13.208
I don't think
you understand how big this is.

30:13.916 --> 30:17.666
We've captured something
no one else ever has, ever,

30:17.666 --> 30:19.541
in the history of the recorded world!

30:19.541 --> 30:21.166
This is not up for discussion, Frank!

30:21.166 --> 30:23.291
Okay. So who are you
gonna sell the house to, huh?

30:23.291 --> 30:26.375
Because every dollar we have
is wrapped up into this.

30:26.375 --> 30:28.500
Well, if it wasn't for you
and that stupid video--

30:28.500 --> 30:29.541
And that's my point.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.208
That's money, baby.

30:32.875 --> 30:36.708
Look, you have guys out there right now
making millions on their channel

30:36.708 --> 30:40.750
by playing <i>Minecraft</i>
and lighting their farts on fire!

30:40.750 --> 30:43.208
And, Mel, we actually have a ghost!

30:47.375 --> 30:48.500
This feels like Houston.

30:49.750 --> 30:51.916
Houston was a pyramid scheme.
That's different.

30:51.916 --> 30:53.375
This... this is real.

30:54.208 --> 30:57.125
This is our chance.
This could change everything.

30:59.625 --> 31:00.791
Mel.

31:02.500 --> 31:04.166
Look at me, baby. Please?

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Look.

31:11.333 --> 31:14.291
I just need to win once.

31:15.916 --> 31:17.000
Just once.

31:21.125 --> 31:22.625
You know this is crazy.

31:23.125 --> 31:24.000
Right?

31:33.958 --> 31:35.833
<i>-That's not a ghost.
- Are you kidding me?</i>

31:35.833 --> 31:37.166
<i>He just walked through the wall!</i>

31:40.708 --> 31:41.750
<i>Oh Jesus!</i>

31:41.750 --> 31:43.083
<i>- Nuh-uh!</i>

31:43.083 --> 31:44.208
<i>What is this?</i>

31:59.791 --> 32:02.375
<i>Ernest is fine!</i>

32:02.375 --> 32:03.291
<i>Mmm!</i>

32:03.291 --> 32:05.916
<i>I do have a crush
on Ernest the ghost!</i>

32:05.916 --> 32:09.083
<i>I had a dream last night
that Ernie impregnated me.</i>

32:09.083 --> 32:10.541
<i>This is what our son looked like.</i>

32:10.541 --> 32:12.750
<i>"Run into a wall like Ernest."</i>

32:13.708 --> 32:15.625
<i>Oh my gosh. Okay.</i>

32:19.125 --> 32:21.833
<i>-You good? You good... Dude, your face.</i>

32:21.833 --> 32:25.166
<i>My name's Cory, and we're going
with the Ernest Challenge. Check me out.</i>

32:32.375 --> 32:34.666
<i>Ghost rights are human rights, you guys.</i>

32:34.666 --> 32:36.125
<i>Ghost rights.</i>

32:36.666 --> 32:38.000
<i>What?</i>

32:38.000 --> 32:42.208
<i>Just because you're not made of matter,
it doesn't mean you don't matter.</i>

32:42.208 --> 32:44.041
<i>If you want rights, go to New Zealand.</i>

32:44.041 --> 32:46.958
<i>They'd love to have you,
but we're fine. Thank you very much.</i>

32:46.958 --> 32:48.666
<i>Also, COVID is not real.</i>

32:48.666 --> 32:49.666
<i>Mental abuse!</i>

32:49.666 --> 32:51.916
<i>I'm just out here
trying to normalize ghost love.</i>

32:51.916 --> 32:54.750
<i>-They're among us.
- Light one up for my ghoulies.</i>

32:54.750 --> 32:57.625
<i>-Who knew someone so dark...
- He's just living in the house.</i>

32:57.625 --> 32:59.333
<i>...could make me feel...</i>

33:13.416 --> 33:16.000
<i>It's a classic campfire tale.</i>

33:16.000 --> 33:20.250
<i>A family moves into an old house
that has a ghost lurking in its halls.</i>

33:20.250 --> 33:24.458
<i>But for a family in Chicago,
that spooky scenario just became real,</i>

33:24.458 --> 33:28.250
<i>and they've got the YouTube videos
to prove it. Take a look.</i>

33:28.250 --> 33:29.416
<i>Frank.</i>

33:31.500 --> 33:33.291
<i>- What is this?</i>
-  <i>Uh...</i>

33:33.291 --> 33:34.208
<i>What?</i>

33:37.166 --> 33:39.541
<i>- It might be time to call the movers.</i>

33:40.666 --> 33:44.083
-  <i>My guests today have...</i>
- Holy shit.

33:45.666 --> 33:49.416
Make sure Anderson gets briefed
before we meet with Congressional Affairs.

33:49.416 --> 33:52.041
Are you chewing gum?
What else we got?

33:52.041 --> 33:54.833
- That woman called again. Leslie?
-  Agent Schipley!

33:54.833 --> 33:57.250
- Oh, Christ on a cracker.
<i>-</i> Agent Schipley.

33:57.250 --> 33:58.958
Leslie. What a lovely surprise.

33:58.958 --> 34:01.458
I've been calling your office
for the past three days.

34:01.458 --> 34:03.541
- Really? I didn't know.
- You saw this, right?

34:04.083 --> 34:05.791
- Uh, no clue.
- It's an RHE.

34:05.791 --> 34:09.208
Leslie, I really appreciate you coming
all the way down here, but--

34:09.208 --> 34:12.375
I ran prelim diagnostics.
I couldn't find any foreign artifacts.

34:13.291 --> 34:16.208
Digital forensics, clean. This one's real.

34:16.208 --> 34:18.041
We need to reopen Wizard Clip.

34:18.041 --> 34:21.500
That program was mothballed 20 years ago
and for a good reason.

34:21.500 --> 34:23.958
This is our chance
to prove once and for all

34:23.958 --> 34:26.625
that spectral phenomena
is not some fantasy.

34:26.625 --> 34:27.791
Let's go.

34:29.125 --> 34:31.125
- Thanks for coming down.
- Please! He's real!

34:31.125 --> 34:34.416
- Come with us, ma'am. Come on, ma'am.
- He's real! Agent Schipley!

34:35.041 --> 34:36.916
He's real! Please!

34:39.833 --> 34:40.958
What?

34:42.583 --> 34:45.916
This is crazy.
How you doing? Yo! What's up?

34:48.500 --> 34:49.958
This is insane.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.250
Yo, what's up?
What's up? What's up?

34:55.791 --> 34:57.458
How do you feel about this ghost?

34:59.000 --> 35:00.875
Can you tell us more about Ernest?

35:00.875 --> 35:04.791
Yo, one second! One second!
Okay, all right! Yo!

35:04.791 --> 35:07.583
Frank, please.
Frank, tell us, please, about the entity!

35:07.583 --> 35:09.833
- All right, okay, yeah.
- The supernatural entity, Ernest!

35:09.833 --> 35:11.666
When's the last time you saw Ernie?

35:12.833 --> 35:15.333
How do you respond
to those who say this is all a hoax?

35:15.333 --> 35:17.166
Uh, if you think it's a hoax, look around.

35:17.166 --> 35:19.583
- There's a lot of people here. I mean...
- Is your family safe?

35:19.583 --> 35:21.458
- Is the community safe?
- When's the last time...

35:21.458 --> 35:23.791
Of course they're safe.
I mean, he's a ghost.

35:25.458 --> 35:27.208
Hey, thank you, guys!

35:31.791 --> 35:34.458
Who is coming into my house?

35:34.458 --> 35:37.708
You guys have a lot of nerve!
This is a private re...

35:37.708 --> 35:38.916
Frank!

35:38.916 --> 35:40.458
- I know.
- This is insane.

35:40.458 --> 35:41.958
- I can't leave the house.

35:41.958 --> 35:43.083
It's not that bad.

35:43.083 --> 35:44.583
Whoa, not that bad?

35:44.583 --> 35:46.541
Someone tried
to crawl down the chimney today...

35:46.541 --> 35:49.250
- What?
- ...to get in. Yeah! They got stuck.

35:49.250 --> 35:51.791
- I had to call the fire department.

35:51.791 --> 35:54.666
Do you know how crazy that is
to have a human being in there?

35:54.666 --> 35:56.250
- It ain't Christm--

35:57.625 --> 35:58.791
- Jesus Christ.
- Ha!

35:58.791 --> 36:00.375
- Not funny.
- Oh...

36:00.375 --> 36:03.666
Hey, go away, or we're calling the cops.

36:05.666 --> 36:10.750
Everything I've read says that
memory loss is connected to trauma.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.000
It's a self-defense mechanism.

36:14.166 --> 36:17.791
We need visual stimuli
to help trigger your memory.

36:19.583 --> 36:20.541
Oh my God.

36:22.333 --> 36:23.208
No?

36:24.791 --> 36:25.875
It's creepy.

36:30.250 --> 36:33.625
It's one of Dad's failed business things.

36:33.625 --> 36:34.875
"Male enhancement pills."

36:34.875 --> 36:37.791
But instead of boners,
they just gave everyone diarrhea.

36:46.333 --> 36:47.416
Do you remember something?

36:53.291 --> 36:54.250
Okay. Okay.

36:54.250 --> 36:55.458
It's okay.

37:06.208 --> 37:07.583
Move out, move.

37:12.666 --> 37:14.833
- You know, there's ghosts everywhere!
- Look at him.

37:16.708 --> 37:17.833
He loves it.

37:19.083 --> 37:19.916
Wh...

37:26.083 --> 37:28.125
Why help?

37:28.708 --> 37:30.125
"Why"? Why, what?

37:42.791 --> 37:44.333
Why help you?

37:46.833 --> 37:48.083
'Cause you're stuck.

37:50.250 --> 37:52.375
Nobody wants to be stuck, right?

38:02.541 --> 38:03.958
- Hey, neighbor!

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
That...

38:06.583 --> 38:07.583
That was loud.

38:07.583 --> 38:10.000
I've never understood
the whole "quiet-in-the-library" thing.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.125
Like, what?
Noise makes you stupid?

38:13.125 --> 38:15.083
Anyway, how are you? How's the ghost?

38:15.666 --> 38:17.791
Our whole street's a shitshow,
thanks to you guys.

38:17.791 --> 38:20.208
My dad has the tow company on speed dial.

38:20.708 --> 38:22.083
It's kind of bad, actually.

38:22.083 --> 38:23.041
Oh.

38:24.166 --> 38:25.416
- Sorry.

38:27.333 --> 38:28.541
What are you working on?

38:29.083 --> 38:29.958
Uh...

38:29.958 --> 38:31.416
Ooh. Property records?

38:31.416 --> 38:32.541
Uh, yeah.

38:32.541 --> 38:36.250
I'm trying to see if Ernest
actually lived in our house

38:36.250 --> 38:37.166
before he died.

38:37.166 --> 38:40.625
- He doesn't remember how he got there?
- He doesn't remember anything.

38:40.625 --> 38:42.250
Ooh. A mystery.

38:43.041 --> 38:44.666
Yeah, I'm just-- Oh.

38:45.250 --> 38:47.000
- Okay.

38:48.291 --> 38:49.750
Are you, like, a hacker or something?

38:52.958 --> 38:54.625
Ta-da! Mystery solved.

38:55.208 --> 38:56.208
Ernest Scheller.

38:56.208 --> 38:58.875
Bought the house April 5th, 1965,

38:58.875 --> 39:01.416
and sold it December 15th, 1971.

39:01.416 --> 39:03.166
- How did he die?
- Gimme a sec.

39:06.041 --> 39:08.333
Oh. Weird. There's no death certificate.

39:08.916 --> 39:10.583
- Pretty sure he's dead.
- You think?

39:13.041 --> 39:16.291
Sorry.
Looks like a dead end. Puns!

39:17.208 --> 39:19.875
Uh, I gotta run.
Band practice. But good luck.

39:20.875 --> 39:21.750
Thanks.

39:32.333 --> 39:34.375
-  Tina, here.

39:46.458 --> 39:49.500
I... I don't wanna hurt your feelings
or anything, but I... I'm drawing the line.

39:49.500 --> 39:52.000
No more rest home readings.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.916
The food always sucks.

39:53.916 --> 39:58.208
What about Kris Jenner? Doesn't she have
someone in her family that died recently?

39:58.875 --> 40:00.458
Her dog? I'm not--

40:00.458 --> 40:02.291
- Oh. Hey. Hi.
-  Hey.

40:02.291 --> 40:04.083
You know, I just... I gotta go. I gotta go.

40:04.083 --> 40:06.541
All right. Okay.
Okay, okay. I gotta go. Hey.

40:06.541 --> 40:09.291
- Hey! Hello. Hey!
- Hey.

40:09.291 --> 40:10.750
Oh my gosh.

40:11.333 --> 40:13.333
- You must be Frank.
-  Yeah.

40:13.333 --> 40:17.375
Everyone here at TSC is just thrilled
about you and everything happening.

40:17.375 --> 40:20.416
Well, we're really excited
to have you in our home.

40:20.416 --> 40:22.291
We're huge fans of the show.

40:22.291 --> 40:24.125
- Aw.
- We watch the show all the time.

40:24.125 --> 40:26.166
You're a gem.
You're a gem. You really are.

40:27.541 --> 40:30.208
Oh, and you're cute!

40:30.791 --> 40:32.833
Nobody said you were cute!

40:33.458 --> 40:34.291
Nobody.

40:34.291 --> 40:36.250
- Just wanna know, where's the wifey?

40:36.250 --> 40:38.125
Uh, she's somewhere getting ready.

40:38.125 --> 40:39.125
Good.

40:39.875 --> 40:40.916
Lock her up.

40:41.833 --> 40:44.875
That's right. And put her in a box
under the bed because

40:44.875 --> 40:46.166
you're mine.

40:51.583 --> 40:54.041
Well, can you make sure that

40:54.041 --> 40:56.166
"he's" ready for me?

40:57.291 --> 40:58.458
- Ernest!
- Yes!

40:58.458 --> 41:00.791
He's... he's good to go. We're ready. We...

41:00.791 --> 41:02.333
- We're cool.
-  Oh, good.

41:03.416 --> 41:05.375
Because I'm ready for him.

41:10.666 --> 41:12.208
Oh. Look, look. See?

41:14.875 --> 41:16.791
That's the kind of vibe you gotta work.

41:16.791 --> 41:18.708
Intensity. Visceral.

41:21.666 --> 41:23.500
- Where'd he go? Make him come back.
- Who?

41:23.500 --> 41:25.541
Kevin, don't play around.
I know he was here.

41:25.541 --> 41:26.833
He's not your lapdog.

41:26.833 --> 41:28.208
I didn't say he--

41:28.208 --> 41:30.791
Look, I got Judy Romano
in my living room right now, man.

41:30.791 --> 41:34.125
- I don't even know who that is.
- Yo, the West Bay Medium's downstairs!

41:34.125 --> 41:35.208
That's who it is!

41:36.916 --> 41:38.375
Why can't you just ask him yourself?

41:38.375 --> 41:39.625
Because he likes you.

41:39.625 --> 41:41.291
- He listens to you.

41:41.291 --> 41:43.875
Sorry to interrupt,
but we're ready for you downstairs.

41:43.875 --> 41:46.000
I'm so sorry. Thank you for your patience.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.416
We'll be right down.

41:50.083 --> 41:52.500
Look, this is important, okay?

41:52.500 --> 41:55.583
Now, this show has a huge following.

41:55.583 --> 41:56.916
Now, if we nail this,

41:56.916 --> 41:59.916
I'm talking about book deals, merchandising...

41:59.916 --> 42:03.208
We could be the Black Kardashians.
Don't you wanna be Kim Kardashian?

42:08.291 --> 42:09.958
Okay.

42:10.750 --> 42:11.583
Anyway.

42:13.416 --> 42:15.041
- Fine.
- You'll talk to him?

42:15.041 --> 42:16.166
I'll try.

42:16.833 --> 42:18.750
My man.

42:23.750 --> 42:24.750
Hey, Ernest.

42:27.208 --> 42:28.375
Ready to have some fun?

42:33.166 --> 42:34.041
Are we rolling?

42:34.041 --> 42:35.041
Oh!

42:39.166 --> 42:40.083
There.

42:41.041 --> 42:42.916
- Oh. So, Frank.

42:42.916 --> 42:49.000
The entire world right now is captivated
by your interactions with Ernest.

42:49.000 --> 42:49.916
Yeah.

42:49.916 --> 42:53.458
You know, but there's
a fair amount of skepticism out there too.

42:53.458 --> 42:55.416
I mean, even myself. Even myself.

42:55.416 --> 42:56.333
I was like,

42:56.833 --> 42:59.333
"I don't think I believe
these videotapes," you know?

42:59.333 --> 43:03.916
But now that I am here,
right in this room,

43:03.916 --> 43:05.791
feeling what I'm feeling,

43:06.500 --> 43:09.875
I mean...
...it's all very palpable, isn't it, right?

43:09.875 --> 43:12.041
Yeah. Ernest is real.

43:12.041 --> 43:14.375
There's... there's no magic here.

43:14.375 --> 43:17.541
So... is he here now?

43:17.541 --> 43:21.750
He... he... he's coming. Right?

43:21.750 --> 43:24.708
He's just shy, you know?
There's a lot of... a lot of people.

43:24.708 --> 43:25.875
Uh-huh.

43:31.500 --> 43:32.500
Frank.

43:33.666 --> 43:35.708
Oh. Oh. Um...

43:36.333 --> 43:37.166
Uh...

43:38.208 --> 43:39.291
Ernest!

43:40.750 --> 43:41.791
You here, man?

43:45.000 --> 43:47.916
-  Ernest, everyone's waiting.

43:47.916 --> 43:48.833
No.

43:48.833 --> 43:51.291
Okay. Okay.

43:51.291 --> 43:53.291
Listen, Frank, if you could just, uh,

43:53.291 --> 43:56.541
fix your little hologram machine, okay,
'cause I need to get outta here.

43:56.541 --> 44:00.166
No, no, no. There is no hologram.
He's...

44:01.666 --> 44:02.750
Ernest!

44:02.750 --> 44:04.375
- We're outta here.
- No, wait.

44:04.375 --> 44:06.458
-  We're done.
-  Stop, no. Stop, please.

44:06.458 --> 44:08.041
Just... just wait, please?

44:45.750 --> 44:46.750
Hey.

44:47.333 --> 44:48.750
Great production value, Frank.

44:49.458 --> 44:51.083
- What?

45:28.916 --> 45:30.750
- Do something!

45:30.750 --> 45:32.625
- What am I supposed to do?
- Tell him to stop!

45:32.625 --> 45:33.791
Oh God!

45:34.833 --> 45:37.083
I gotta get out of basic cable.

45:37.083 --> 45:38.791
It's just so unprofesh.

45:53.875 --> 45:55.833
What the...

46:07.250 --> 46:09.416
Oh. You again.

46:14.208 --> 46:18.541
Yeah, you know what?
On second thought, Tupac was better.

46:18.541 --> 46:20.666
Yeah. I'm gonna have to fix you in post.

46:58.500 --> 46:59.875
This is a disaster.

47:00.458 --> 47:02.208
They wanted a ghost. They got a ghost.

47:02.208 --> 47:04.625
Yeah, they wanted a ghost,
and we gave 'em <i>The Conjuring</i>.

47:05.625 --> 47:07.875
Oh, it's funny to you, huh?
Everything's a joke to you.

47:09.416 --> 47:10.541
Fulton, not now, man.

47:10.541 --> 47:12.250
We're getting tons of views
on the new video.

47:12.250 --> 47:14.875
- You posted it without my permission?
- Yeah, so?

47:14.875 --> 47:16.291
I'mma get sued, man!

47:18.833 --> 47:20.916
Three million views in six minutes.

47:21.541 --> 47:23.083
- That's gotta be a record, right?
- Mm.

47:23.750 --> 47:25.291
Good work, man!

47:25.291 --> 47:28.125
- Hey, kiss my ass, Pewdiepie.

47:43.833 --> 47:46.291
<i>Dr. Monroe. Are you there?</i>

47:46.291 --> 47:48.041

- What?

48:11.625 --> 48:12.708
- Not here. Come on.
- What?

48:15.083 --> 48:16.208
Sorry. Need a minute.

48:16.208 --> 48:17.333
You can't be in here.

48:17.333 --> 48:20.541
Says who? Your stupid gender norms?
Beat it, roach!

48:24.000 --> 48:26.958
Joy, what the hell?
Are you losing your mind?

48:26.958 --> 48:29.041
No, but prepare to lose yours.

48:37.458 --> 48:38.541
It's not him.

48:38.541 --> 48:40.875
Yeah, but that's why we couldn't find
a death certificate.

48:41.666 --> 48:43.416
Ernest Scheller isn't dead.

48:44.416 --> 48:46.166
That guy used to live
in your house though.

48:46.166 --> 48:48.541
I cross-referenced, like,
a bunch of records to make sure.

48:48.541 --> 48:50.333
- So, who's our Ernest?
- Mmm.

48:51.208 --> 48:53.416
But I bet my left nut
that guy knows who he is.

48:53.416 --> 48:56.458
- You bet your what?
- That Ernest lives somewhere in Oklahoma.

48:56.458 --> 48:58.291
I'm still trying to find out where.

48:58.291 --> 49:01.750
But he used to own this dive bar
that's still around.

49:02.791 --> 49:04.416
Oh shit! That's like a mile from us.

49:04.416 --> 49:06.708
Yeah, I know. What if we took him there?

49:06.708 --> 49:07.666
Who?

49:08.791 --> 49:10.250
- Our Ernest?
- Yeah.

49:10.250 --> 49:11.708
Maybe they knew each other.

49:11.708 --> 49:14.041
Maybe it was like a hangout,
and there's a trigger there.

49:14.041 --> 49:16.083
Joy, he can't leave the house.

49:16.708 --> 49:18.666
He... He's stuck there.

49:19.625 --> 49:20.458
Are you sure?

49:24.291 --> 49:28.416
- Ernest! I love you, Ernest!

49:34.833 --> 49:37.666
Nonexclusive?
Are you kidding me, man?

49:37.666 --> 49:40.458
Look, I'm already runnin' original content
through my channel

49:40.458 --> 49:43.541
and making three times what you offered,
so think about what you just said.

49:43.541 --> 49:46.500
Think of a number and call me back,
all right? Bye.

49:48.458 --> 49:49.958
Frank, can you get the door, please?

49:49.958 --> 49:52.791
No, look, I'm serious.
Like, an Ernest cartoon would be amazing.

49:52.791 --> 49:54.750
But I want it to be
something like Adult Swim.

49:54.750 --> 49:57.666
Have you ever seen a naked ghost?
I haven't. What would that look like?

49:58.583 --> 50:01.791
- Frank, are you gonna get the door?
- What parts would a naked ghost have?

50:04.791 --> 50:06.166
Okay, I'm coming!

50:10.375 --> 50:12.791
- Sorry. We're not talking to the press.

50:16.625 --> 50:18.875
Just a few minutes of your time,
if I may, please?

50:20.208 --> 50:22.958
And Joy was doing all this research.

50:22.958 --> 50:26.375
Found out that the guy who lived here
used to own a bar not too far from here.

50:26.375 --> 50:29.125
So we figured,
if we could get you to the bar,

50:29.125 --> 50:30.625
maybe you'd remember something.

50:30.625 --> 50:32.291
Oh!

50:32.291 --> 50:33.541
Joy.

50:34.125 --> 50:35.125
Come on.

50:36.625 --> 50:38.125
You're right. Sorry.

50:39.708 --> 50:41.833
Okay, so we figured
that if we could get...

50:44.333 --> 50:46.416
It's so cold!

50:47.833 --> 50:49.208
Oh my God, I'm sorry. It's...

50:49.208 --> 50:50.833
I love this. I'm-- I'm a fan.

50:50.833 --> 50:52.708
I just-- I know I'm being annoying.

50:52.708 --> 50:55.375
Just, this is a thing
that's actually happening, and...

50:56.916 --> 50:59.041
Sorry.

51:00.083 --> 51:00.916
Anyway.

51:02.291 --> 51:03.500
We need to get you outside.

51:04.916 --> 51:06.875
Are you sure you can't leave?

51:13.500 --> 51:14.416
Have you tried?

51:16.416 --> 51:17.625
I mean, really tried.

51:20.666 --> 51:21.500
Okay.

51:23.666 --> 51:24.708
Listen, Ernest.

51:26.291 --> 51:27.166
I get it.

51:27.833 --> 51:30.958
You've been here a long time,

51:30.958 --> 51:33.916
and the world is such a scary place.

51:35.416 --> 51:38.666
Believe me, sometimes it terrifies me too,

51:39.958 --> 51:42.125
but there aren't any answers
left in this house.

51:42.833 --> 51:45.208
If we're gonna find out who you are...

51:47.083 --> 51:48.333
what happened to you...

51:50.708 --> 51:51.916
it's out there.

51:54.250 --> 51:58.333
I am so sorry to come over here uninvited.

51:58.333 --> 52:01.958
- I would've called, you know, but--
- Sorry. What's the point of this visit?

52:03.916 --> 52:07.500
Back in the late '90s,
I was recruited by the CIA

52:07.500 --> 52:11.750
to spearhead a program called Wizard Clip.

52:12.875 --> 52:13.791
Wizard Clip?

52:14.875 --> 52:18.708
Is that like, y'all just get high
and watch Harry Potter movies and...

52:18.708 --> 52:19.625
Babe.

52:19.625 --> 52:21.541
Wizard Clip was a textbook spook op,

52:21.541 --> 52:24.375
hidden from most echelons
of the government.

52:24.375 --> 52:26.833
Our field was paranormal psychology,

52:26.833 --> 52:31.291
but our orders were
to find and apprehend a ghost.

52:35.541 --> 52:37.666
There's nothing to be afraid of.
I promise.

52:38.208 --> 52:39.125
Okay?

52:57.875 --> 53:00.375
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

53:00.375 --> 53:02.291
Listen to me. Listen.

53:04.333 --> 53:06.291
You're not alone anymore, Ernest.

53:07.875 --> 53:10.125
I'm right here with you
every step of the way.

53:12.166 --> 53:13.250
You got this.

54:04.916 --> 54:06.875
Soon as word got out that

54:06.875 --> 54:12.125
millions of taxpayers' dollars
were being spent on woo-woo science,

54:12.625 --> 54:14.750
we were abruptly shut down,

54:14.750 --> 54:18.583
and the agency
threw me under the proverbial bus.

54:20.208 --> 54:21.666
A sacrificial lamb.

54:22.291 --> 54:23.541
It was soul-crushing.

54:27.458 --> 54:29.708
But then along came Ernest.

54:29.708 --> 54:34.041
Okay. Thank you so much for coming over,
but as you can see, we are busy.

54:35.041 --> 54:36.041
I'd like to see him.

54:36.041 --> 54:37.458
That's not gonna happen.

54:38.208 --> 54:41.625
I don't think you understand
the gravity of your situation.

54:41.625 --> 54:44.000
These entities, they are dangerous.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.458
I'd like you to leave, please.

54:45.458 --> 54:48.916
They may present kindly,
but they are never who they say they are.

54:48.916 --> 54:51.750
- I'm not gonna ask you--
- Your son Kevin.

54:51.750 --> 54:54.416
He's close to it.
I've seen it in the videos. He's at risk!

54:54.416 --> 54:56.041
All right! That's enough! Now, get out!

54:56.041 --> 54:59.458
This is a matter of national security.
I have a right to be here.

54:59.458 --> 55:01.208
Then come back with a warrant.

55:01.208 --> 55:04.875
But until that time,
get the hell out of my house.

55:11.041 --> 55:11.958
I'll be back.

55:12.833 --> 55:13.666
That's a promise.

55:28.666 --> 55:29.541
It's him!

55:29.541 --> 55:30.708
Shit!

55:30.708 --> 55:32.958
Oh my God! It's him! It's Ernest!

55:32.958 --> 55:34.541
- It's him!

55:47.333 --> 55:48.666
Ernest! Ernest!

56:20.375 --> 56:21.666
Shit!

56:26.083 --> 56:26.916
Dick move!

56:26.916 --> 56:27.833
Come on.

Okay, whatever. Can you just
make yourself invisible already?

57:25.291 --> 57:27.166
What?
Why didn't he do that sooner?

57:27.166 --> 57:29.000
I don't know. Come on. We gotta go.

57:29.916 --> 57:31.083
This is bullshit.

57:31.083 --> 57:33.791
Well... [moans] ...I hate to remind you

57:33.791 --> 57:36.000
about a little thing
called the Fourth Amendment.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.625
They're harboring a terrorist.

57:37.625 --> 57:41.875
I'm not sure a ghost
would legally qualify as a terrorist.

57:44.625 --> 57:46.208
They'll make a mistake.

57:48.125 --> 57:50.333
Careless people always do.

57:53.500 --> 57:55.041
And when that happens...

57:57.625 --> 57:58.791
we'll be ready.

58:11.291 --> 58:13.416
Chuck E. Cheese
is down the street, kiddos.

58:13.958 --> 58:16.666
Do you know this guy?
He used to work here back in the day.

58:16.666 --> 58:18.833
This place has had over a dozen owners.

58:19.500 --> 58:21.125
Can't we just look around for a minute?

58:21.125 --> 58:24.541
Sweetie, I could lose my liquor license.
You gotta go.

58:26.500 --> 58:28.458
Come on. This is stupid. Let's just go.

58:32.208 --> 58:34.208
Hey, wait.

58:35.666 --> 58:37.166
Let me see that picture again.

58:45.000 --> 58:45.833
There.

58:52.041 --> 58:52.875
Oh my God.

58:57.041 --> 58:59.333
See? There is a connection.

58:59.333 --> 59:00.250
I knew it.

59:01.125 --> 59:03.166
Hold on. You're that kid, aren't you?

59:03.166 --> 59:05.666
Uh, I'm sorry. I don't...
I don't know what you're talking about.

59:05.666 --> 59:08.041
With the ghost in your house.
It is you! Holy shit!

59:08.041 --> 59:10.333
Okay, thank you for your time.
We have to go.

59:12.250 --> 59:13.375
You're a genius.

59:13.958 --> 59:16.458
This Scheller guy
has to know who Ernest really is.

59:16.458 --> 59:18.625
And to think that you doubted me.

59:18.625 --> 59:19.833
I never doubted you.

59:20.333 --> 59:22.458
- Now we just have to find where he is.
-  Mom!

59:22.458 --> 59:24.083
There's a ghost over there!

59:24.625 --> 59:26.125
That's nice, sweetie.

59:28.541 --> 59:29.375
Ernest.

59:31.041 --> 59:32.500
Ernest, what's wrong?

59:35.625 --> 59:36.583
Ernest.

59:42.416 --> 59:44.000
-  Ernest!

59:48.625 --> 59:49.541
Ernest!

59:59.666 --> 1:00:01.375
Hi, Daddy.

1:00:05.125 --> 1:00:06.208
Junebug.

1:00:14.791 --> 1:00:16.083
Shit.

1:00:16.083 --> 1:00:17.875
Mom!

1:00:20.041 --> 1:00:22.291
Ernest, come on! We gotta go!

1:00:22.833 --> 1:00:23.708
Ernest!

1:00:25.791 --> 1:00:26.916
Ernest!

1:00:28.458 --> 1:00:29.541
<i>Ernest!</i>

1:00:34.541 --> 1:00:36.291
<i>Ernest, come on! We gotta go!</i>

1:00:40.166 --> 1:00:42.791
I think a warrant just fell
right into our lap.

1:00:44.791 --> 1:00:46.541
"Ernest The Not-So-Friendly Ghost."

1:00:46.541 --> 1:00:48.958
"Paranormal Whacktivity."

1:00:48.958 --> 1:00:50.416
They think he's a monster now.

1:00:50.416 --> 1:00:53.833
He saw something out there.
Like he was remembering something.

1:00:53.833 --> 1:00:56.500
Well, it looks like
he's trying to kidnap Shirley Temple!

1:00:56.500 --> 1:00:58.416
And why didn't you tell me
he could go outside?

1:00:58.416 --> 1:01:00.000
That should've been my exclusive.

1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:01.500
You're not listening to me.

1:01:01.500 --> 1:01:02.666
He said a name,

1:01:02.666 --> 1:01:05.333
it was, uh, June something.

1:01:05.333 --> 1:01:07.541
- So what?
- So maybe that's why he's stuck here.

1:01:08.541 --> 1:01:10.791
Something happened to him. Something bad.

1:01:10.791 --> 1:01:15.083
Maybe if we help him remember more,
he can, uh, cross over.

1:01:15.083 --> 1:01:16.500
Cross over?

1:01:16.500 --> 1:01:20.833
We don't want him to cross over, Kevin.
We need him here with us.

1:01:22.041 --> 1:01:23.875
You really
don't give a shit about him, do you?

1:01:23.875 --> 1:01:26.916
I give a shit about us!
This is about our future.

1:01:26.916 --> 1:01:30.041
This is about Fulton's college tuition.
It's about yours.

1:01:30.041 --> 1:01:31.375
Don't make this about us.

1:01:32.625 --> 1:01:33.708
It's about you.

1:01:34.541 --> 1:01:35.750
Always is.

1:01:36.375 --> 1:01:38.333
Hey, I'm not finished talking to you, man.

1:01:45.250 --> 1:01:46.833
You didn't hear a word he said.

1:02:15.291 --> 1:02:16.833
Hello, ladies.

1:02:20.125 --> 1:02:23.375
Dude, I just hit 200K followers
on Instagram. It's insane.

1:02:23.375 --> 1:02:24.333
<i>Seriously?</i>

1:02:24.333 --> 1:02:28.041
Everybody at school is so jealous,
but I didn't choose to be this hot.

1:02:28.041 --> 1:02:30.125
I didn't choose to get famous like this.

1:02:30.125 --> 1:02:33.041
Come on. No, literally,
a supplement company hit me up.

1:02:33.041 --> 1:02:35.208
They wanna pay me $1,000 per post.

1:02:35.208 --> 1:02:38.541
<i>- Hey, king. That's mental.</i>
- Yeah. Hey. Mmm...

1:02:50.041 --> 1:02:52.333
You know I get recognized
'bout everywhere I go.

1:02:58.375 --> 1:03:00.250
- So, I know I...
<i>- Oh, I love all that.</i>

1:03:02.958 --> 1:03:03.916
Fulton?

1:03:05.375 --> 1:03:07.125
Fulton! What the hell is this?

1:03:07.125 --> 1:03:08.916
-  Freeze!
- Hey, get out of my house!

1:03:08.916 --> 1:03:12.166
Where's my babies? Kevin! Fulton!

1:03:50.708 --> 1:03:53.250
Negative. Both kids
left their cell phones behind.

1:03:53.250 --> 1:03:56.125
We have the boy's laptop.
Doing a sweep on the hard drive.

1:03:56.125 --> 1:03:58.250
Keep them around.
They might come in handy.

1:03:58.250 --> 1:04:01.791

So, according
to the records I found,

1:04:16.333 --> 1:04:18.916
Scheller lives here,
just outside of Tulsa,

1:04:19.500 --> 1:04:22.375
which is about
400 miles from here, give or take.

1:04:23.166 --> 1:04:24.500
Shit. That's far.

1:04:25.083 --> 1:04:27.583
We'll take driving shifts.
We'll make it.

1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.041
Okay.
I appreciate the optimism.

1:04:35.916 --> 1:04:38.541
You look... different.

1:04:39.166 --> 1:04:40.750
- I do?
- Yeah.

1:04:41.833 --> 1:04:43.208
Being an outlaw suits you.

1:04:44.625 --> 1:04:45.625
Thanks.

1:04:52.250 --> 1:04:55.125
Um, we should...
we should probably get going.

- Uh...

1:05:57.083 --> 1:06:00.333
- You-- Energy drinks?
<i>- All we know is they were in their rooms.</i>

1:06:00.333 --> 1:06:01.375
Last aisle, in the back.

1:06:01.375 --> 1:06:03.208
- Thanks.
<i>- At 11:15, we checked.</i>

1:06:04.083 --> 1:06:04.958
<i>They were gone.</i>

1:06:09.500 --> 1:06:10.541
Look at these.

1:06:11.125 --> 1:06:13.041
Come one. Try 'em.
They'll look good on you.

1:06:20.041 --> 1:06:22.875
Yeah. Flick 'em down a little.
Give some 'tude.

1:06:30.583 --> 1:06:32.458
You look like the bad guy from <i>The Matrix.</i>

1:06:34.166 --> 1:06:35.333
Look how good you look.

1:06:42.208 --> 1:06:43.041
Crap!

1:06:46.250 --> 1:06:48.541
What? Where are you?

1:06:55.083 --> 1:06:56.541
Shit, this is bad.

1:07:05.875 --> 1:07:07.000
Uh-huh.

1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:08.166
Howdy, ghost boy.

1:07:09.291 --> 1:07:10.208
Ma'am.

1:07:11.458 --> 1:07:13.583
- Mind stepping out of the vehicle for me?
- Me?

1:07:13.583 --> 1:07:16.750
Son, I'm gonna need you to lay down
and put your hands behind your head.

1:07:17.458 --> 1:07:18.750
Is there a problem, Officer?

1:07:18.750 --> 1:07:21.208
- Don't make me repeat myself now.

1:07:33.625 --> 1:07:34.875
Really sorry about this!

1:07:35.958 --> 1:07:37.750

1:07:46.458 --> 1:07:47.666

1:07:47.666 --> 1:07:48.916
Ha... Hands up!

1:07:54.250 --> 1:07:56.458
- Go, go, go, go, go.

1:07:57.750 --> 1:08:00.958
- Oh my God. I kicked him in the nuts!

1:08:00.958 --> 1:08:02.541
- Where's Ernest?
- I don't know!

1:08:09.208 --> 1:08:10.791

1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:28.208

1:11:35.250 --> 1:11:36.375
Where's he going?

1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.916
We already told you. We don't know.

1:11:39.916 --> 1:11:42.208
We have a right
to legal counsel, all right?

1:11:42.208 --> 1:11:43.958

1:11:43.958 --> 1:11:46.041

1:11:47.208 --> 1:11:49.208

I've gotta go to the restroom.

1:11:53.625 --> 1:11:55.625
Do I need permission to pee?

1:11:57.333 --> 1:11:58.375
Let her go.

1:12:10.041 --> 1:12:12.833
Oh my goodness!
I am so sorry! Are you okay?

1:12:12.833 --> 1:12:14.416
Oh my God.

1:12:20.458 --> 1:12:21.291

1:12:21.291 --> 1:12:22.333

1:12:24.541 --> 1:12:26.125
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

1:12:26.125 --> 1:12:27.250

1:12:28.583 --> 1:12:31.583

1:12:41.791 --> 1:12:42.875
<i>I love you too.</i>

Those darn telemarketers.
They're the worst, right?

1:12:48.291 --> 1:12:52.250
Aiding and abetting
a known fugitive is a federal crime.

1:12:52.250 --> 1:12:53.625
Where is he?

1:12:54.875 --> 1:12:59.125
Lady, I'd just as soon
swallow a bag of razor blades

1:12:59.125 --> 1:13:03.625
and chase it with some fresh lemon juice
than to tell you jack shit.

1:13:04.833 --> 1:13:06.958

Wait, this must be a mistake.

1:14:32.291 --> 1:14:35.083
- Maybe I should take a dump on the bed.

1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:37.666
We could just share this one.

1:14:38.500 --> 1:14:39.333
Sh... Share?

1:14:39.916 --> 1:14:41.750

I mean, everyone thinks you're kidnapped.

You could just pretend you got away.

1:15:36.750 --> 1:15:37.791
Wait.

1:15:39.541 --> 1:15:41.375
You're saying I should just ditch you?

1:15:42.041 --> 1:15:44.416
- Why would I do that?
- So you don't go to jail, maybe?

1:15:45.375 --> 1:15:46.791
It's a good reason.

1:15:46.791 --> 1:15:48.041
Are you kidding?

1:15:48.750 --> 1:15:49.791
I was already in jail.

1:15:50.833 --> 1:15:54.500
Band, AP classes,
math tutoring, choir practice.

1:15:55.250 --> 1:15:59.041
My dad's programmed every second
of my life, and it's exhausting.

1:15:59.041 --> 1:16:01.250
At least your dad cares.

1:16:02.083 --> 1:16:03.291
It's a culture thing.

1:16:03.958 --> 1:16:05.541
We have to be the best.

1:16:06.250 --> 1:16:08.875
Prove that we belong. It's bullshit.

1:16:09.708 --> 1:16:12.791
Sometimes it just seems
like he doesn't even know me.

1:16:14.125 --> 1:16:17.041
He just sees this fake version of me
that he created.

1:16:17.041 --> 1:16:20.041
I don't know.
I guess it's what a lot of parents do.

1:16:20.875 --> 1:16:25.708
Try and fix themselves through their kids,
but they just mess 'em up more in the end.

1:16:27.208 --> 1:16:31.833
The sad thing is me and my dad were
actually best friends when I was a kid.

1:16:33.708 --> 1:16:34.708
I miss that.

1:16:36.291 --> 1:16:37.125
What happened?

1:16:37.958 --> 1:16:39.833
I don't know. It...

1:16:41.083 --> 1:16:45.916
It wasn't just one thing. It was, like,
a bunch of things over time, and...

1:16:47.625 --> 1:16:48.708
us moving around a lot,

1:16:49.333 --> 1:16:53.541
him promising things to my mom
that just never happened.

1:16:55.208 --> 1:16:56.875
Seeing how much it would hurt her.

1:16:57.708 --> 1:16:59.583
After a while, I just pulled away.

1:17:01.875 --> 1:17:04.375
Sometimes I feel like
I'm not even his son anymore.

1:17:16.083 --> 1:17:17.000

1:17:18.791 --> 1:17:19.708

- I know who you are. Come in.

1:20:26.625 --> 1:20:28.500
That's my wife, Ramona.

1:20:30.166 --> 1:20:32.833
Suffered a stroke last year.

1:20:32.833 --> 1:20:35.000
Can't really do much these days.

1:20:37.333 --> 1:20:38.500
Have a seat.

1:20:44.791 --> 1:20:47.291
Can I get you something to drink?

1:20:47.291 --> 1:20:51.083
Um, juice, pop, pineapple juice?

1:20:51.083 --> 1:20:53.750
Ramona loves pineapple juice.

1:20:54.375 --> 1:20:55.500
Whatever you want.

1:20:55.500 --> 1:20:57.666
No, no. No, I'm fine.

1:20:58.458 --> 1:20:59.500
Okay.

1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:04.625
Funny thing, I, uh...

1:21:06.666 --> 1:21:10.666
I was in a bowling league ages ago.

1:21:12.250 --> 1:21:14.583
One day, I can't find my shirt.

1:21:15.291 --> 1:21:16.916
I looked high and low.

1:21:17.958 --> 1:21:21.083
Ramona said I was always losing things,

1:21:21.083 --> 1:21:24.916
even the damn shirt
off my own back, but, uh...

1:21:26.750 --> 1:21:28.625
I knew something wasn't right.

1:21:31.750 --> 1:21:33.791
I didn't see that shirt again

1:21:33.791 --> 1:21:38.333
till a couple of weeks ago
when I saw one of your videos on the TV.

1:21:40.041 --> 1:21:44.166
Well, I've seen
some crazy things in my life, but this...

1:21:46.333 --> 1:21:49.166
I really can't believe this is real.

1:21:54.875 --> 1:21:57.958
His name was Randy. Randy McGovern.

1:21:57.958 --> 1:22:01.958
That woman next to him
was my wife's sister, Evelyn.

1:22:01.958 --> 1:22:04.375
Dear, kind woman.

1:22:04.375 --> 1:22:07.583
She died from, uh, complications in labor.

1:22:07.583 --> 1:22:08.500
He had a child?

1:22:09.625 --> 1:22:11.291
Daughter. June.

1:22:13.250 --> 1:22:14.083
Junebug.

1:22:16.208 --> 1:22:17.750
Randy, what happened to him?

1:22:17.750 --> 1:22:21.208
Ramona and I never really wanted kids.

1:22:21.208 --> 1:22:24.666
Just always thought we'd travel,
see the world.

1:22:26.500 --> 1:22:29.458
But life had other plans for us.

1:22:29.458 --> 1:22:32.958
After Evelyn died,
Randy sort of fell apart, I guess.

1:22:33.541 --> 1:22:34.750
Took to drinking.

1:22:36.291 --> 1:22:40.958
Then one day, he showed up
at our house with little June,

1:22:41.666 --> 1:22:44.583
said he had an appointment,
needed us to watch her,

1:22:45.250 --> 1:22:46.750
but he never came back.

1:22:47.333 --> 1:22:50.333
Just left that poor little girl with us.
She was four.

1:22:50.333 --> 1:22:53.583
Nobody ever heard from
or saw that man again.

1:22:53.583 --> 1:22:56.791
Maybe something happened,
like an accident or--

1:22:56.791 --> 1:23:00.833
Police found his car
for sale at a used lot,

1:23:00.833 --> 1:23:04.750
uh, his watch at a pawn shop.

1:23:05.333 --> 1:23:06.875
He took my shirt,

1:23:07.458 --> 1:23:09.375
my driver's license.

1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:12.541
Might have used that
to change his identity.

1:23:14.916 --> 1:23:16.291
What do you think happened?

1:23:16.291 --> 1:23:19.583
My guess, uh, drank himself to death.

1:23:20.166 --> 1:23:21.541
Suicide, maybe. Who knows?

1:23:21.541 --> 1:23:25.333
It's... it's hard to feel much sympathy
for somebody like that,

1:23:25.333 --> 1:23:28.375
abandoning their own motherless child.

1:23:28.375 --> 1:23:30.458
I can't think of a greater sin than that.

1:23:30.458 --> 1:23:31.458
No.

1:23:32.541 --> 1:23:34.833
No. No, no. No way.
He wouldn't do something like that.

1:23:34.833 --> 1:23:37.791
You said it yourself.
He can't remember, right?

1:23:39.291 --> 1:23:44.208
Maybe the reason he can't remember,
because the truth, what he did,

1:23:45.083 --> 1:23:46.416
is too unbearable.

1:23:56.083 --> 1:23:58.250
Randy? That's you, isn't it?

1:24:08.916 --> 1:24:10.083
Oh my God.

1:24:18.458 --> 1:24:20.583
Get away from me! Get away from me!

1:24:24.250 --> 1:24:25.875
Ernest! Get out of here!

1:24:30.166 --> 1:24:31.875
Get off me!

1:24:32.458 --> 1:24:34.000
- Get off me!

1:24:41.791 --> 1:24:42.708
Go to thermal!

1:24:45.625 --> 1:24:46.541
Light him up!

1:24:51.875 --> 1:24:53.958
Ernest! Stop!

1:24:55.333 --> 1:24:56.500
Stop!

1:24:57.083 --> 1:24:59.083
- Stop, you're hurting him!

1:25:00.541 --> 1:25:01.750
Ernest!

1:25:04.666 --> 1:25:07.125
Get your hands up! Hands up now!

1:25:07.125 --> 1:25:08.125
Get 'em up!

1:25:08.125 --> 1:25:09.125
Ernest, no!

1:25:11.708 --> 1:25:13.125
- On your feet, now!
- No.

1:25:24.333 --> 1:25:25.458
They have him.

1:25:26.333 --> 1:25:27.666
Where are you taking him?

1:25:29.291 --> 1:25:30.291
Ernest!

1:25:43.291 --> 1:25:44.291
Kevin.

1:25:47.958 --> 1:25:48.875
Are you okay?

1:25:48.875 --> 1:25:50.875
- Yeah. I'm fine.
<i>-</i> Did they hurt you?

1:25:50.875 --> 1:25:51.958
-  No.
- Are you sure?

1:25:52.583 --> 1:25:54.000
- Yeah.
- Let's get you home.

1:26:07.083 --> 1:26:09.041
I guess this worked out for you, huh?

1:26:09.041 --> 1:26:13.375
I think, considering the situation,
it's a pretty fair exchange, don't you?

1:26:14.916 --> 1:26:17.291
Now you and your family
can go live a normal life.

1:26:30.875 --> 1:26:32.333
- Hey.

1:26:36.625 --> 1:26:37.583
Sorry about your car.

1:26:38.625 --> 1:26:39.458
It's just a car.

1:26:40.958 --> 1:26:42.166
You good though?

1:26:45.625 --> 1:26:46.500
Yeah.

1:27:24.916 --> 1:27:28.625
I've been
waiting for this moment

1:27:30.083 --> 1:27:31.291
for so long.

1:27:58.500 --> 1:27:59.458
No, no, no.

1:28:00.625 --> 1:28:01.833
Stand down. I'm good.

1:28:07.916 --> 1:28:11.166
Come on, just right this way.
Ah, there she is.

1:28:11.958 --> 1:28:14.625
Ah, the woman of the hour.

1:28:15.291 --> 1:28:17.541
Gentlemen... Oh, and lady,

1:28:17.541 --> 1:28:20.666
please meet Dr. Leslie Monroe.

1:28:20.666 --> 1:28:23.583
Oh, actually, I correct myself.

1:28:23.583 --> 1:28:24.791
Agent Monroe.

1:28:24.791 --> 1:28:29.666
She assisted us in capturing
the asset you see before you.

1:28:29.666 --> 1:28:31.125
- Very good job, yes.

1:28:31.125 --> 1:28:32.083
Bravo.

1:28:32.083 --> 1:28:34.708
So, now--
No, please, please, just take a look.

1:28:41.708 --> 1:28:44.083
Of course you did more than just assist.
That was just--

1:28:44.083 --> 1:28:45.041
What's the endgame?

1:28:46.416 --> 1:28:48.583
-  I'm sorry, endgame?
-  Well...

1:28:51.208 --> 1:28:52.625
What are you gonna do with him?

1:28:52.625 --> 1:28:55.833
Well, he's dead, so, uh...

1:28:57.375 --> 1:28:58.708
whatever the hell we want.

1:29:27.833 --> 1:29:30.583
Hi, um, is Kevin around?

1:29:31.791 --> 1:29:33.125
I haven't seen him at school.

1:29:33.125 --> 1:29:36.250
Uh, yeah, he's just taking
a little break from stuff, honey.

1:29:36.750 --> 1:29:38.208
Maybe come back another time?

1:29:38.208 --> 1:29:39.666
Yeah, okay.

1:29:39.666 --> 1:29:40.916
It's okay, Mom.

1:29:44.083 --> 1:29:45.083
Hey.

1:29:45.750 --> 1:29:47.875
You haven't responded to any of my texts.

1:29:48.458 --> 1:29:49.541
Yeah, I...

1:29:50.541 --> 1:29:54.916
I haven't really felt like
talking to anyone, so...

1:29:54.916 --> 1:29:56.833
It's okay. I get it.

1:30:00.833 --> 1:30:01.666
How is everything?

1:30:02.291 --> 1:30:06.083
Well, I'm grounded until I'm 80,
but other than that, super peachy.

1:30:08.958 --> 1:30:12.083
Um, I just... I wanted to check up on you.

1:30:15.041 --> 1:30:15.958
Cool.

1:30:17.458 --> 1:30:18.625
Thanks.

1:30:18.625 --> 1:30:20.333
No, really though. Are you doing okay?

1:30:23.166 --> 1:30:24.000
Yeah.

1:30:25.916 --> 1:30:26.791
I'm fine.

1:30:29.416 --> 1:30:30.458
See you around.

1:30:53.166 --> 1:30:54.041
Hey.

1:31:01.625 --> 1:31:03.250
It's so quiet up here now.

1:31:09.625 --> 1:31:11.208
Feels strange.

1:31:18.250 --> 1:31:20.583
It was raining like this
the day you were born.

1:31:21.375 --> 1:31:24.583
I remember because
I was driving your mom to the hospital,

1:31:25.875 --> 1:31:27.666
and traffic was so bad.

1:31:29.208 --> 1:31:31.458
I thought she was gonna
give birth right there in the car.

1:31:32.041 --> 1:31:33.125
I was petrified.

1:31:33.125 --> 1:31:37.041
I made a promise to myself
that if we made it to the hospital...

1:31:40.666 --> 1:31:42.416
I was gonna be the best dad in the world.

1:31:46.625 --> 1:31:47.791
It's funny.

1:31:50.625 --> 1:31:51.958
When your kids are little,

1:31:53.250 --> 1:31:54.541
it's easy to be a parent.

1:31:56.041 --> 1:31:59.666
They don't see who you actually are.

1:32:01.583 --> 1:32:03.041
They just see the good stuff.

1:32:04.208 --> 1:32:05.541
What you want them to see.

1:32:07.625 --> 1:32:10.041
But eventually, as they grow up...

1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:16.625
parts of yourself that you don't like
become harder and harder to hide.

1:32:19.416 --> 1:32:20.375
I guess

1:32:21.583 --> 1:32:24.541
I never really figured out who I am.

1:32:27.833 --> 1:32:29.750
I've just always chased stuff.

1:32:30.416 --> 1:32:32.250
New places, new jobs...

1:32:34.458 --> 1:32:36.125
hoping something would click,

1:32:37.333 --> 1:32:43.041
and I would finally be the man
I wanted to be for you and Fulton...

1:32:45.833 --> 1:32:47.041
and your mom.

1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:50.333
But then Ernest came, and I was like,

1:32:50.875 --> 1:32:52.208
"This is it."

1:32:55.625 --> 1:32:56.750
I could finally...

1:32:59.375 --> 1:33:01.333
have a purpose.

1:33:02.916 --> 1:33:04.458
I could finally be worthy.

1:33:10.708 --> 1:33:12.333
I lost myself all over again.

1:33:16.083 --> 1:33:17.291
I let you down, kid.

1:33:22.708 --> 1:33:24.166
I broke my promise.

1:33:38.166 --> 1:33:39.666
I know you're upset about Ernest.

1:33:41.125 --> 1:33:44.750
But you tried to do the right thing,
and that's all that matters.

1:33:48.208 --> 1:33:51.583
You're a better man at 16

1:33:52.291 --> 1:33:53.958
than I am at 45.

1:33:57.041 --> 1:33:58.416
I admire you, Kevin.

1:34:01.166 --> 1:34:03.416
You turned out great, in spite of me.

1:34:44.583 --> 1:34:47.208
Can you face me, please? Turn towards me.

1:34:51.041 --> 1:34:52.000
Turn around.

1:34:56.250 --> 1:34:57.375
Turn around.

1:35:00.750 --> 1:35:02.458
I said turn around.

1:35:06.083 --> 1:35:07.083
Comply.

1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:15.000
Comply.

1:35:17.708 --> 1:35:20.000
I said comply!

1:35:22.541 --> 1:35:23.750
<i>Comply!</i>

1:36:35.500 --> 1:36:36.750
Comply!

1:36:45.666 --> 1:36:47.625
Yeah. Works on the living too.

1:36:54.291 --> 1:36:55.291
Thank you.

1:36:56.083 --> 1:36:56.916
Get out of here.

1:37:03.250 --> 1:37:05.125
- ...figured it out.
- Where is our Uber?

1:37:05.125 --> 1:37:06.541
It's a Lyft, stupid.

1:37:06.541 --> 1:37:08.458
- You're stupid, Tara.
- Oh my God!

1:37:08.458 --> 1:37:10.916
- We're gonna get mugged and die out here.
- No, no.

1:37:10.916 --> 1:37:13.375
- It's gonna be fine.
- We should go to Taco Bell!

1:37:13.375 --> 1:37:15.000
- Yes!

1:37:15.666 --> 1:37:18.083
- Wait, is that it? Oh my God!
- Oh my God! Thank you!

1:37:18.083 --> 1:37:19.333
Hi, hi, hi.

1:37:19.333 --> 1:37:21.375
- Is this for Gabby?
- Uh-huh.

1:37:28.041 --> 1:37:29.875
Holy shit, man!

1:37:30.625 --> 1:37:32.791
Ernest, dude!

1:37:32.791 --> 1:37:35.208
Uh, excuse me. This is my Uber.

1:37:35.208 --> 1:37:37.583
Uh, it's a Lyft, bitch.

1:37:37.583 --> 1:37:38.958
Bye!

1:37:39.458 --> 1:37:40.375
Wait!

1:37:41.083 --> 1:37:42.833
Hell yeah!

1:37:42.833 --> 1:37:44.875
- So, which way you headed, Ernest?

1:37:48.458 --> 1:37:49.708
You got it.

1:38:07.708 --> 1:38:08.541
Ernest?

1:38:59.875 --> 1:39:02.708
-  I missed this house.

1:39:07.125 --> 1:39:09.541
Randy, a ghost.

1:39:09.541 --> 1:39:12.083
A goddamn ghost.

1:39:17.041 --> 1:39:21.625
Fifty years... I've kept this secret.

1:39:23.625 --> 1:39:26.791
But the chickens
finally came home to roost.

1:39:26.791 --> 1:39:28.625
I don't know anything. I swear.

1:39:28.625 --> 1:39:30.833
You're lying. You came after me.

1:39:30.833 --> 1:39:33.625
- I was just trying to help him.
- You're lying!

1:39:35.166 --> 1:39:38.166
- Frank. Did you hear that?
- Okay. All right. Yup, yup, yup.

1:39:46.500 --> 1:39:47.416
Stay here.

1:39:48.333 --> 1:39:49.750
- Be careful.
- All right.

1:40:12.458 --> 1:40:14.500
- What are you doing?
- Thought I heard something!

1:40:14.500 --> 1:40:16.750
Shit.

1:40:16.750 --> 1:40:17.666
Me too.

1:40:18.750 --> 1:40:19.583
Stay here.

1:40:19.583 --> 1:40:20.541
Yeah, right.

1:40:22.625 --> 1:40:23.541
Come on.

1:40:54.666 --> 1:40:55.666
Drop it.

1:40:56.500 --> 1:40:58.041
Okay. Okay, take it easy.

1:41:04.250 --> 1:41:05.875
Please don't hurt my son.

1:41:06.458 --> 1:41:08.333
It was Ramona's idea.

1:41:08.875 --> 1:41:13.041
She couldn't have kids of her own,
and when her sister died,

1:41:13.041 --> 1:41:15.583
she said it was a sign from God

1:41:16.166 --> 1:41:19.958
that Randy couldn't take care of June
without her mother.

1:41:19.958 --> 1:41:23.666
She made me do it.
I didn't want to. She made me.

1:41:23.666 --> 1:41:25.791
We can talk about this.
Just put the gun down.

1:41:25.791 --> 1:41:27.458
- Don't!
- Okay, okay.

1:41:27.458 --> 1:41:29.208
Frank, what's happening?

1:41:31.083 --> 1:41:32.750
Get him out of here!

1:41:33.833 --> 1:41:35.041
- Dad!
- Let's go!

1:41:35.041 --> 1:41:36.291
- Dad!
-  Come on!

1:41:52.166 --> 1:41:53.458
Get away from them!

1:42:02.125 --> 1:42:03.166
Go to Mom!

1:42:13.791 --> 1:42:15.208
- Come on!
- Stop it!

1:42:15.208 --> 1:42:16.708
- Kevin, no!
-  Get in!

1:42:16.708 --> 1:42:18.416
Kevin, no! Kevin!

1:42:26.875 --> 1:42:28.625
Kevin! No! Please!

1:42:28.625 --> 1:42:30.583
Stay inside! Call the cops!

1:44:02.541 --> 1:44:04.000
Little Junebug.

1:44:04.958 --> 1:44:07.250
She made Ramona so happy.

1:44:07.250 --> 1:44:10.583
That's all she really wanted
was her own little girl.

1:44:10.583 --> 1:44:12.791
She doesn't talk to us anymore.

1:44:12.791 --> 1:44:16.125
Maybe deep down she knows...

1:44:46.833 --> 1:44:48.625
What?

1:44:57.666 --> 1:44:59.250
I killed you!

1:45:21.208 --> 1:45:22.375
I knew you'd come back.

1:45:25.583 --> 1:45:26.500
Kevin!

1:45:34.500 --> 1:45:36.333
- Dad, no!

1:45:53.625 --> 1:45:54.500
Kevin.

1:45:54.500 --> 1:45:55.708
Dad.

1:45:55.708 --> 1:45:57.416
Okay. I got you. You okay?

1:45:57.416 --> 1:45:58.583
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:46:00.458 --> 1:46:01.541
Ernest.

1:46:03.208 --> 1:46:05.541
Frank! Kevin! Oh, thank God!

1:46:06.041 --> 1:46:07.125
Thank God.

1:46:24.916 --> 1:46:26.083
And that was it?

1:46:27.291 --> 1:46:32.750
This ghost that was haunting your house
for, what, 50 years, just suddenly...

1:46:34.791 --> 1:46:35.708
he's gone?

1:46:37.583 --> 1:46:38.875
It was dark.

1:46:39.875 --> 1:46:42.708
It was raining. It was hard to see, but...

1:46:44.583 --> 1:46:46.458
I... I looked around, and he wasn't there.

1:46:48.583 --> 1:46:50.666
Why... why would he just vanish like that?

1:46:51.333 --> 1:46:52.166
I don't know.

1:46:53.500 --> 1:46:55.166
Maybe he didn't need to be here anymore.

1:46:57.333 --> 1:46:58.750
Found the guy who killed him

1:47:00.333 --> 1:47:01.375
and got closure.

1:47:12.208 --> 1:47:13.708
What really happened, Kevin?

1:49:34.458 --> 1:49:35.500
Hi, Daddy.

1:50:08.500 --> 1:50:09.625
Oh, nice.

1:50:10.166 --> 1:50:11.583
Okay, let me try. Let's see.

1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:18.583
I suck. Okay.

1:52:13.625 --> 1:52:14.625
Bye, Ernest.

1:52:20.750 --> 1:52:21.625
Kevin.

1:52:23.750 --> 1:52:27.541
Tell me what happened.

1:52:45.708 --> 1:52:47.166
<i>Hey, sorry I can't be there.</i>

1:52:47.166 --> 1:52:49.333
Oh yeah. I'm sure you're just devastated.

1:52:49.333 --> 1:52:51.333
- Why aren't you studying, boy?

1:52:51.333 --> 1:52:53.250
<i>Dad, come on. It's a Saturday. Please.</i>

1:52:53.250 --> 1:52:54.875
Yeah, and what the hell is a Saturday?

1:52:54.875 --> 1:52:56.000
- Go study.
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

1:52:59.041 --> 1:53:02.375
But I feel bad for whoever has
to deal with this shitty attic.

1:53:06.208 --> 1:53:09.833
You know, I don't really think I'm down
with you not being my neighbor anymore.

1:53:09.833 --> 1:53:12.541
Well, I'm only like five miles away.

1:53:12.541 --> 1:53:14.750
- Plus, I get my car soon.

1:53:14.750 --> 1:53:16.458
Okay. Smell you, bitch.

1:53:16.458 --> 1:53:19.375
I know. Ka-ching!
Haunted houses are a thing now.

1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:26.583
Figured I'd find you two up here.

1:53:26.583 --> 1:53:27.875
- Dad.

1:53:27.875 --> 1:53:30.000
Hey, the truck is loaded.
It's time to say goodbye.

1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:33.625
Uh, last chance for y'all
to do whatever y'all were doing

1:53:33.625 --> 1:53:35.041
or gonna do before you did.

1:53:35.041 --> 1:53:36.166
- Stop it.
- Last chance.

1:53:36.166 --> 1:53:37.208
Please save me.

1:53:37.208 --> 1:53:38.500
-  Thank you.
- I got this.

1:53:38.500 --> 1:53:39.875
Come on. See you downstairs.

1:53:39.875 --> 1:53:41.208
- Thank you.
-  Bye.

1:53:41.208 --> 1:53:43.375
- Yes, great.
-  However you say bye.

1:53:43.875 --> 1:53:45.625
- My... my parents.
- Mm-hmm.

1:53:57.833 --> 1:53:59.208
What are you thinking about?

1:54:01.916 --> 1:54:03.583
Do you think he can still see us?

1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:08.208
Wherever he is?

1:54:10.958 --> 1:54:11.958
I don't know.

1:54:13.666 --> 1:54:14.625
Maybe.
