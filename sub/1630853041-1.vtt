WEBVTT

03:37.992 --> 03:40.516
Mom, Dad, Josh hit me.

03:40.559 --> 03:41.604
Did not.

03:41.647 --> 03:43.084
Did too.

03:43.127 --> 03:44.650
Jack.

03:44.694 --> 03:46.435
I barely nudged her and only
because she was in my room.

03:46.478 --> 03:49.003
It's been your room
for all of two minutes.

03:49.046 --> 03:50.831
How about a little
border neutrality,

03:50.874 --> 03:53.268
at least until we're
officially moved in.

03:53.311 --> 03:54.660
Never mind that.

03:54.704 --> 03:57.011
We don't hit girls ever.

03:57.054 --> 03:58.926
Do we Jack?

03:58.969 --> 04:00.797
Apologize to your sister.

04:00.841 --> 04:01.537
I didn't hit her.

04:01.580 --> 04:03.321
I barely touched her.

04:03.365 --> 04:04.932
She's just being a baby.

04:04.975 --> 04:06.629
What did I say?

04:06.672 --> 04:07.848
Fine.

04:07.891 --> 04:11.939
Sorry, Gabby... that
you're such a baby.

04:11.982 --> 04:13.157
Hey.

04:13.201 --> 04:14.985
You don't want anyone
in your room, huh?

04:15.029 --> 04:16.204
Fine.

04:16.247 --> 04:17.118
Get your ass up there
now and stay there

04:17.161 --> 04:20.251
until I tell you you can leave.

04:20.295 --> 04:21.339
Move it.

04:24.952 --> 04:25.822
Kent.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.084
What?

04:27.128 --> 04:29.043
Can I speak to you in
the kitchen, please?

04:35.310 --> 04:36.920
Gabby, will you
start taking the tape

04:36.964 --> 04:40.271
off some of these boxes for
me while I talk to Daddy?

04:40.315 --> 04:41.011
OK.

04:41.316 --> 04:42.056
Thank you.

04:46.712 --> 04:49.019
What was that about?

04:49.063 --> 04:50.325
What?

04:50.368 --> 04:51.630
You're always telling
me I'm too easy on him,

04:51.674 --> 04:54.068
and I should let him get
away with talking back.

04:57.375 --> 04:59.377
Fine.

04:59.421 --> 05:02.641
I'm not happy about this.

05:02.685 --> 05:04.208
I mean, look at me.

05:04.252 --> 05:07.995
Here I am standing on this
shitty linoleum in his ugly ass

05:08.038 --> 05:09.083
kitchen.

05:09.126 --> 05:09.997
So you want our
kids to be homeless

05:10.040 --> 05:11.999
so you can maintain your spite.

05:13.957 --> 05:19.528
It's just that being here
makes me feel like a failure...

05:19.571 --> 05:21.182
like he's laughing at me.

05:21.225 --> 05:22.792
Kent, turn on the news.

05:22.835 --> 05:25.926
We're hardly the only ones going
through something like this.

05:25.969 --> 05:28.972
Baby, I don't think
your father left you

05:29.016 --> 05:30.931
this house so he
can laugh at you.

05:30.974 --> 05:33.107
I think he left it to you
because even a mean drunk

05:33.150 --> 05:38.416
like him had to realize that you
are the one worthwhile thing he

05:38.460 --> 05:40.984
did with his life.

05:55.956 --> 05:59.785
Hey, buddy, you all right?

05:59.829 --> 06:01.439
Yeah, sorry.

06:09.491 --> 06:10.971
I'm sorry I yelled.

06:14.278 --> 06:17.673
Moving kind of sucks, huh?

06:17.716 --> 06:18.848
Yeah.

06:18.891 --> 06:19.762
Well, school should
be starting soon.

06:19.805 --> 06:22.025
Bet you're excited about that.

06:22.069 --> 06:22.983
Yeah, right.

06:23.026 --> 06:23.940
Oh, that's right.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.550
I forgot.

06:25.594 --> 06:28.249
You're my kid who doesn't love
homework and book reports...

06:28.292 --> 06:29.380
the weird one.

06:29.424 --> 06:30.686
I'm not weird.

06:30.729 --> 06:33.254
Gabby's weird, probably
because she's adopted.

06:33.297 --> 06:37.040
Hey, I don't ever want to hear
you say something like that

06:37.084 --> 06:38.607
again, OK?

06:38.650 --> 06:40.391
She's your sister.

06:40.435 --> 06:42.611
She has been since
she was a week old.

06:42.654 --> 06:44.917
She always will be.

06:44.961 --> 06:46.876
I didn't mean it like bad.

06:46.919 --> 06:50.010
OK, but it still wasn't nice.

06:50.053 --> 06:53.839
And you can't just go
shoving her around either.

06:53.883 --> 06:55.493
I know.

06:55.537 --> 06:57.974
There is one good thing about
moving here over spring break,

06:58.018 --> 06:58.714
though.

06:58.757 --> 06:59.236
Oh yeah?

06:59.280 --> 06:59.802
Mm-hmm.

06:59.845 --> 07:01.282
What's that?

07:01.325 --> 07:02.326
We're here just in time to
sign you up for baseball.

07:02.370 --> 07:04.633
Yeah, that's cool,
but I was kind

07:04.676 --> 07:07.114
of thinking about playing
a different sport.

07:07.157 --> 07:08.115
Really, what's that?

07:08.158 --> 07:09.203
Football!

07:09.246 --> 07:11.640
Oh, OK.

07:11.683 --> 07:12.467
Wait, no.

07:12.510 --> 07:13.946
Flag on the play.

07:13.990 --> 07:15.774
Unnecessary roughness.

07:15.818 --> 07:16.514
No way.

07:16.558 --> 07:18.081
That was a clean hit.

07:18.125 --> 07:18.908
Right.

07:23.347 --> 07:26.046
OK, buddy, save it for
the field, all right?

07:26.089 --> 07:28.961
Your mom wants us to get
cleaned up for dinner.

07:29.005 --> 07:29.527
Good.

07:29.571 --> 07:32.095
I'm starving.

07:32.965 --> 07:34.576
Kent, you want some tea?

07:34.619 --> 07:36.056
Yeah, sure.

07:36.099 --> 07:37.231
Tell me when.

07:37.274 --> 07:39.059
Oh.

07:39.102 --> 07:39.668
Thank you.

07:39.711 --> 07:40.408
Mm-hm.

07:43.846 --> 07:45.326
Elbows off the table, Jack.

07:45.369 --> 07:48.633
And napkins go in
lap-kins, Gabs.

07:48.677 --> 07:52.246
Yeah, and be sure to put your
pinkies up when you drink,

07:52.289 --> 07:53.464
kids.

07:53.508 --> 07:56.076
There is nothing
wrong good manners.

07:56.119 --> 07:58.165
I never said there was.

08:01.211 --> 08:01.994
Earthquake.

08:02.038 --> 08:02.821
Everybody under the table.

08:02.865 --> 08:03.387
Go.

08:03.431 --> 08:04.084
Go now.

08:06.477 --> 08:08.175
It's OK, sweetie.

08:08.218 --> 08:08.914
It's OK.

08:08.958 --> 08:10.960
It'll be over soon.

08:13.397 --> 08:16.139
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, hang on, Jack.

08:16.183 --> 08:18.489
There could be aftershocks.

08:18.533 --> 08:22.145
I thought there weren't supposed
to be earthquakes in Texas.

08:22.189 --> 08:23.233
They happen everywhere.

08:23.277 --> 08:25.322
But they are pretty rare here.

08:25.366 --> 08:26.715
Not rare enough.

08:26.758 --> 08:28.108
Did you see that light?

08:28.151 --> 08:29.979
It looked like something
exploded in our back yard.

08:30.022 --> 08:32.808
Well, it's probably
a power transformer.

08:32.851 --> 08:34.940
It could have been
miles away, though.

08:34.984 --> 08:36.377
Light travels fast.

08:36.420 --> 08:38.857
At the speed of light.

08:38.901 --> 08:40.381
That's right, sweetie.

09:09.192 --> 09:11.977
Hey, look what I found.

09:12.021 --> 09:14.980
You know there's nothing
to be afraid of in the dark

09:15.024 --> 09:16.025
though, right?

09:16.068 --> 09:17.069
I know.

09:17.113 --> 09:19.028
You don't sound very convincing.

09:19.071 --> 09:20.682
Neither do you.

09:20.725 --> 09:23.641
I'm going to plug it
in right over here, OK?

09:26.949 --> 09:28.080
How's that?

09:28.124 --> 09:29.473
Great.

09:29.517 --> 09:30.779
Uh-oh.

09:30.822 --> 09:32.041
What?

09:32.084 --> 09:36.176
I think I see a blanket
monster right here.

09:36.219 --> 09:41.442
Oh my god.

09:41.485 --> 09:42.182
OK.

09:45.272 --> 09:46.621
There we go.

09:49.014 --> 09:51.974
That pillow could use
some more fluffing.

09:54.890 --> 09:55.934
Goodnight, pumpkin.

09:55.978 --> 09:57.414
Good night, Daddy.

10:06.467 --> 10:08.338
Better your majesty?

10:08.382 --> 10:09.252
Much.

10:09.296 --> 10:10.079
Dork.

10:13.082 --> 10:15.258
How we doing in here?

10:15.302 --> 10:17.826
You don't need a night
light too, do you?

10:17.869 --> 10:19.523
I'm not afraid of the dark.

10:20.568 --> 10:21.221
Cell phones?

10:21.264 --> 10:21.960
Got it.

10:26.095 --> 10:26.835
I'll go.

10:29.272 --> 10:30.317
Hey, hey, hey.

10:30.360 --> 10:34.146
Hey, hey, hey, you're OK.

10:34.190 --> 10:35.887
The lights just went out.

10:35.931 --> 10:38.020
A saw a monster.

10:38.325 --> 10:40.805
There's no such thing
as monsters, sweetie.

10:40.849 --> 10:41.589
Here.

10:43.982 --> 10:45.549
I got something for you.

10:49.074 --> 10:50.380
Here you go.

10:54.515 --> 10:56.038
You all right now?

10:56.081 --> 10:57.257
I guess.

10:57.300 --> 10:58.301
OK, I'm going to go
check that breaker.

10:58.345 --> 10:59.302
No, don't leave me.

10:59.346 --> 11:01.304
Oh, Gabby, come on.

11:01.348 --> 11:05.308
There's nothing to be
afraid of, sweetie.

11:05.352 --> 11:08.006
OK, look.

11:08.050 --> 11:08.529
See?

11:08.572 --> 11:10.270
Nothing.

11:10.313 --> 11:12.489
Nothing.

11:12.533 --> 11:16.058
Nothing Nothing.

11:16.101 --> 11:18.278
It's all clear.

11:18.321 --> 11:20.018
OK.

11:24.240 --> 11:24.980
Nothing.

11:29.201 --> 11:32.161
Nothing.

11:32.204 --> 11:32.944
Nothing.

13:12.479 --> 13:15.351
You think the kids
are going to be OK?

13:15.395 --> 13:17.309
As soon as we get
cable and internet,

13:17.353 --> 13:19.399
they won't even
realize we moved.

13:19.442 --> 13:21.357
I'm being serious.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.793
You grew up in the same place.

13:22.837 --> 13:26.449
Mom and I moved around
a lot after Dad left.

13:26.493 --> 13:29.321
It's not easy being the new kid.

13:29.365 --> 13:32.237
I think it will be a little
bit of an adjustment for Gabby,

13:32.281 --> 13:35.110
but once school
starts she'll be fine.

13:35.153 --> 13:38.983
Jack, on the other hand, could
make friends on the moon.

13:40.898 --> 13:42.422
And tell you the truth...

13:42.465 --> 13:43.945
I'm more worried about you.

13:43.988 --> 13:48.863
I know what I said earlier,
but I just needed to vent.

13:48.906 --> 13:50.995
I'll be fine.

13:51.039 --> 13:54.434
Actually, I'm looking
forward to my new job.

13:54.477 --> 13:56.958
Working for the Brown Foundation
may not pay that well,

13:57.001 --> 13:59.700
but at least I don't
have to deal with anyone

13:59.743 --> 14:01.092
looking over my shoulder.

14:01.136 --> 14:02.485
It's kind of sad, though.

14:02.529 --> 14:05.532
Won't you miss
being around people?

14:05.575 --> 14:06.141
No.

14:07.229 --> 14:08.926
Why do you think I went into
research instead of medicine?

14:08.970 --> 14:13.148
So you have absolutely no
interest in human contact.

14:13.191 --> 14:14.279
Good to know.

14:14.323 --> 14:15.498
What I didn't mean
all human contact.

14:15.542 --> 14:15.890
Oh, so just checking
if this would be OK.

14:26.335 --> 14:27.292
Mm-hm.

14:27.336 --> 14:28.555
Mm-hm.

14:28.598 --> 14:35.910
How about this?

14:56.191 --> 14:59.760
You look like you could
use this more than I.

14:59.803 --> 15:00.804
Bless you.

15:02.589 --> 15:06.506
Dad there's a giant
burnt-out hole back there.

15:06.549 --> 15:08.638
I told you something exploded.

15:08.682 --> 15:09.421
It's awesome.

15:09.465 --> 15:10.640
You've got to come see.

15:10.684 --> 15:13.077
Can I at least finish my coffee?

15:13.121 --> 15:14.209
But it's a giant.

15:14.252 --> 15:17.429
Hole

15:17.473 --> 15:18.387
OK.

15:18.430 --> 15:19.649
Hey, you two be careful.

15:19.693 --> 15:21.608
I don't want either
one of you falling in.

15:21.651 --> 15:22.304
We will.

15:22.347 --> 15:23.871
Come on.

15:23.914 --> 15:24.959
Kent.

15:25.002 --> 15:25.525
We will.

15:25.568 --> 15:27.135
Scout's honor.

15:33.837 --> 15:38.625
Hey, hey, what did you
just tell your mother?

15:38.668 --> 15:40.844
What do you think caused it?

15:40.888 --> 15:42.411
I don't know.

15:42.454 --> 15:44.892
But if I had to guess, I'd
say it's probably an old well.

15:44.935 --> 15:46.023
An oil well?

15:46.067 --> 15:48.809
Could be, but more likely water.

15:48.852 --> 15:51.115
Earthquake probably let loose
a pocket of natural gas,

15:51.159 --> 15:54.858
and then any little spark, like
from rocks rubbing together...

15:54.902 --> 15:56.164
Whoosh.

15:56.207 --> 15:56.773
Yep.

15:56.947 --> 15:58.079
Giant fireball time.

15:58.122 --> 15:59.602
Cool.

15:59.646 --> 16:00.777
Will it do it again?

16:00.821 --> 16:01.648
Oh, no way.

16:01.691 --> 16:03.084
You saw all the gas burn up.

16:03.127 --> 16:04.651
And now that the
hole is open, it

16:04.694 --> 16:08.132
would just dissipate
into the air.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.395
How deep do you think it is?

16:13.355 --> 16:14.835
Want to find out?

16:25.628 --> 16:27.630
Whoa.

16:27.674 --> 16:29.893
What do you two idiots
think you're doing?

16:29.937 --> 16:31.068
Get away from there.

16:31.112 --> 16:33.723
But Mom.

16:33.767 --> 16:35.333
Your mom's right.

16:35.377 --> 16:36.378
Back in the house.

16:36.421 --> 16:37.945
I'm going to cover
this up, and I

16:37.988 --> 16:41.557
don't want you or your sister
messing around back here.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.646
You hear me?

16:43.690 --> 16:44.647
Jack?

16:44.691 --> 16:46.127
Yeah, OK.

17:42.313 --> 17:46.013
I'll be the mommy, and
you'll be the daddy.

17:46.056 --> 17:46.753
I know.

17:46.796 --> 17:49.059
But just for pretend.

17:49.103 --> 17:50.365
Look at this room.

17:50.408 --> 17:53.498
It's a pig's eye.

17:53.542 --> 17:54.717
Sty?

17:54.761 --> 17:56.719
What's a sty?

17:56.763 --> 17:57.720
Hey, Gabs.

17:57.764 --> 18:00.114
Who you talking to, sweetie?

18:00.157 --> 18:01.506
Grandpa.

18:01.550 --> 18:02.769
Oh, you playing telephone
with Grandpa Edwards?

18:02.812 --> 18:04.684
No, I was playing house
with Grandpa Peroni.

18:04.727 --> 18:08.688
Sweetie, you know Grandpa
Peroni's dead, right?

18:08.731 --> 18:09.601
Mm-hm.

18:09.645 --> 18:12.692
And you know what that means?

18:12.735 --> 18:14.128
OK.

18:14.171 --> 18:16.521
Jeez, it's freezing in here.

18:16.565 --> 18:17.131
Wow.

18:17.871 --> 18:19.742
Hey, how about you come
downstairs with me.

18:19.786 --> 18:21.265
We'll see if Daddy can
fix the heat in here.

18:21.309 --> 18:22.005
OK.

18:46.464 --> 18:49.076
And you're wondering why
Gabby's seeing monsters.

18:49.119 --> 18:50.468
Those are pretend.

18:50.512 --> 18:52.296
The one I saw was real.

18:52.340 --> 18:53.950
Gabby.

18:53.994 --> 18:55.778
There is something weird going
on in her room with the heat.

18:55.822 --> 18:56.997
It's freezing in there.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.477
Pilot probably went
out on the furnace.

18:59.521 --> 19:02.742
It's 50 years old like
everything else here.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.877
I'll check it out.

19:07.921 --> 19:08.486
Hey.

19:08.617 --> 19:09.705
I was winning.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.707
Only because your
mom distracted me.

19:11.751 --> 19:12.839
Don't worry.

19:12.882 --> 19:14.101
I'll be right back
to kick your butt.

19:14.144 --> 19:15.102
In your dreams.

19:15.145 --> 19:15.885
In yours.

19:15.929 --> 19:16.712
In yours.

19:16.756 --> 19:17.321
In yours.

19:17.365 --> 19:18.235
In yours.

19:20.716 --> 19:21.935
In yours.

19:48.962 --> 19:49.745
Dammit.

20:21.995 --> 20:25.085
Hey, sweetie, you
seen your mother?

20:25.128 --> 20:28.305
Mom, Dad's bleeding to death.

20:31.265 --> 20:32.788
What happened?

20:32.832 --> 20:33.833
I just tripped and scraped
myself on an old garden tool.

20:33.876 --> 20:35.704
Do we have any
hydrogen peroxide?

20:35.747 --> 20:39.142
Upstairs in the cabinet.

20:39.186 --> 20:39.882
Which cabinet?

20:39.926 --> 20:41.362
Just come with me.

20:41.405 --> 20:42.929
Geez, you really did a number
on yourself, didn't you?

20:42.972 --> 20:44.278
Hey, kids, stay here, OK?

20:44.321 --> 20:45.888
If someone comes to the door...

20:45.932 --> 20:46.628
Don't answer it.

20:46.671 --> 20:48.151
Come and get you.

20:48.195 --> 20:49.239
That's right.

20:49.283 --> 20:50.197
Just don't get
blood on your shirt.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.720
I can't get that out.

20:57.944 --> 20:58.945
There.

20:58.988 --> 21:00.381
All better.

21:00.424 --> 21:02.470
Now, you want me to kiss
it like I do with the kids.

21:02.513 --> 21:05.386
No thanks, I know where
that mouth has been.

21:05.429 --> 21:07.257
Hey, watch it, buddy.

21:07.301 --> 21:09.738
Hey, I wasn't complaining.

21:09.781 --> 21:12.523
Good job not getting
blood on your shirt.

21:16.092 --> 21:17.354
Thank you.

21:17.398 --> 21:18.921
I'm going to head back
down to the basement,

21:18.965 --> 21:20.967
check out the furnace.

21:21.010 --> 21:23.056
How cold did you
say it was in there?

21:23.099 --> 21:24.100
Gabby's room.

21:24.144 --> 21:25.972
It was freezing
just a minute ago.

21:36.069 --> 21:37.679
It feels fine in here now.

21:37.722 --> 21:40.769
Maybe even a little
warm, actually.

21:40.812 --> 21:43.728
Furnace must have kicked
back on on its own.

21:46.296 --> 21:48.255
What is it?

21:48.298 --> 21:49.734
Oh, nothing.

22:05.272 --> 22:06.012
Come on.

22:16.718 --> 22:17.980
Three!

22:18.024 --> 22:19.721
My pick of doom.

22:19.764 --> 22:21.636
You are never getting out.

22:21.679 --> 22:23.029
No fair!

22:23.072 --> 22:23.943
You guys.

22:30.645 --> 22:31.385
Pizza.

22:33.778 --> 22:34.954
Do you have any singles?

22:34.997 --> 22:35.650
I think so.

22:35.693 --> 22:38.435
All I have is a 20.

22:38.479 --> 22:39.523
Three do?

22:39.567 --> 22:42.309
Perfect.

22:42.352 --> 22:45.573
It's, uh, 19.

22:45.616 --> 22:46.356
$19.17.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.575
There you go.

22:47.618 --> 22:48.750
Thanks.

22:48.793 --> 22:50.186
Your coupons are on
top of the boxes.

22:50.230 --> 22:51.927
I'll take those.

22:51.971 --> 22:52.623
Thank you.

22:52.667 --> 22:53.624
Careful.

22:53.668 --> 22:54.234
Thank you.

22:54.277 --> 22:55.365
You're welcome.

22:55.409 --> 22:57.367
Have a good night.

22:59.804 --> 23:03.721
Mom, Dad, Gabby
messed up the game.

23:03.765 --> 23:05.027
I did not.

23:05.071 --> 23:07.160
Then who did?

23:07.203 --> 23:09.249
If I say, you'll get mad.

23:09.292 --> 23:10.815
Not if it's the truth.

23:13.644 --> 23:14.906
Grandpa Peroni.

23:14.950 --> 23:17.953
Gabriella Meredith, you
know we do not accept

23:17.997 --> 23:19.433
telling lies in this family.

23:19.476 --> 23:20.825
I'm not lying.

23:20.869 --> 23:22.653
Then obviously your eyes
are playing tricks on you

23:22.697 --> 23:24.786
because you're tired and
you need to go to bed.

23:24.829 --> 23:25.961
Now tell the truth.

23:26.005 --> 23:26.875
I did.

23:26.918 --> 23:27.702
Fine.

23:27.745 --> 23:28.355
Go upstairs.

23:28.398 --> 23:29.138
Brush your teeth.

23:29.182 --> 23:29.965
Get ready for bed.

23:30.009 --> 23:30.748
But...

23:30.792 --> 23:31.836
No buts.

23:31.880 --> 23:32.576
Go.

23:44.762 --> 23:47.548
Geez, it's freezing
in here again.

23:52.509 --> 23:53.989
No, that's too hot now.

23:54.033 --> 23:54.946
Leave it.

23:54.990 --> 23:56.252
I don't want you
catching a cold.

23:56.296 --> 23:57.688
Fine.

23:57.732 --> 24:00.082
Goodnight, sweetie.

24:00.126 --> 24:00.909
Night.

24:06.784 --> 24:08.308
You think that's funny?

24:10.310 --> 24:12.225
I am coming back
in five minutes.

24:12.268 --> 24:13.878
If you are not
still covered, we're

24:13.922 --> 24:15.315
going to have a real problem.

24:15.358 --> 24:16.707
Do you understand?

24:36.597 --> 24:37.989
Mm.

24:38.033 --> 24:40.644
Oh yeah.

24:40.688 --> 24:42.168
Hey, what are you doing?

24:42.211 --> 24:44.561
You know pepperoni
makes you fart.

24:44.605 --> 24:45.258
No it doesn't.

24:45.301 --> 24:47.564
It makes you fart.

24:47.608 --> 24:48.391
He's old.

24:48.435 --> 24:50.132
Everything makes him fart.

24:50.176 --> 24:50.741
Hey.

24:51.481 --> 24:53.092
Not my fault. You know
that's why they call

24:53.135 --> 24:55.529
old guys like me old farts.

24:55.572 --> 24:57.487
I can't help it.

24:57.531 --> 24:59.098
No, you could help it.

25:06.670 --> 25:10.979
Man, you totally let that
guy get me on purpose.

25:11.022 --> 25:13.024
Gotta learn to watch your six.

25:15.288 --> 25:17.986
Can we restart?

25:18.029 --> 25:19.205
It's bedtime, anyway.

25:19.248 --> 25:22.121
Just one more shot
at this level.

25:22.164 --> 25:23.774
Not tonight.

25:23.818 --> 25:25.907
I've got to go to work tomorrow,
which means that while I'm gone

25:25.950 --> 25:27.213
you're the man of the house.

25:27.256 --> 25:29.389
I need you well-rested
so you can protect

25:29.432 --> 25:31.739
your mom and your sister.

25:31.782 --> 25:33.088
Get moving soldier.

25:33.132 --> 25:33.958
All right.

26:06.208 --> 26:06.730
Mom!

26:07.166 --> 26:07.992
Dad!

26:08.036 --> 26:08.558
Mom!

26:08.689 --> 26:09.907
Dad!

26:09.951 --> 26:10.473
Mom!

26:10.778 --> 26:11.300
Dad!

26:11.344 --> 26:11.953
Hey, hey, hey.

26:12.083 --> 26:13.084
Whoa, whoa.

26:13.128 --> 26:14.303
Hey, hey, what is it?

26:14.347 --> 26:16.000
There was someone
in the bathroom.

26:16.044 --> 26:18.481
They were hiding in the tub.

26:18.525 --> 26:19.178
OK.

26:19.221 --> 26:20.266
I got this.

26:20.309 --> 26:22.224
Why don't you show me, OK?

26:25.358 --> 26:28.056
Aren't you going to get
a weapon or something.

26:28.099 --> 26:30.145
I think we'll be all right.

26:30.189 --> 26:31.538
So what did this
guy looked like?

26:31.581 --> 26:34.149
Big, red-eyed, and he was
sticking his arms out,

26:34.193 --> 26:35.672
pushing at the shower curtain.

26:35.716 --> 26:38.284
But he kind of disappeared
when I turned the lights on.

26:38.327 --> 26:38.936
He did?

26:38.980 --> 26:40.199
Let's take a look.

26:48.032 --> 26:50.252
I don't know what
to tell you, buddy.

26:50.296 --> 26:51.558
Wait.

26:51.601 --> 26:53.995
Watch what happens when
I turn out the lights.

26:58.826 --> 27:00.958
I swear I saw something.

27:01.002 --> 27:02.960
I believe you.

27:03.004 --> 27:04.135
It's all right.

27:10.490 --> 27:11.578
I'm not crazy.

27:11.621 --> 27:12.883
I know what I saw.

27:13.188 --> 27:15.277
Sometimes when our brain
can't process something,

27:15.321 --> 27:17.671
it just sort of makes stuff up.

27:17.714 --> 27:21.152
With the stress of the move
and the earthquake last night

27:21.196 --> 27:23.764
and that weird hole
in the back yard,

27:23.807 --> 27:25.679
it was just searching
for a solution.

27:25.722 --> 27:29.291
And for you, it's a red-eyed
monster in the bathtub.

27:29.335 --> 27:30.858
That doesn't make you crazy.

27:30.901 --> 27:33.382
It just makes you human.

27:33.426 --> 27:35.384
We all just need to get
a good night's sleep.

27:35.428 --> 27:38.692
Everything will be back
to normal tomorrow.

27:38.735 --> 27:40.824
I promise.

27:40.868 --> 27:41.695
OK?

27:41.738 --> 27:42.870
OK.

27:42.913 --> 27:44.132
Hold on.

27:44.175 --> 27:47.266
There is something very
wrong in this room.

27:50.921 --> 27:52.096
Pepperoni.

27:52.140 --> 27:53.576
Oh, you.

27:56.666 --> 27:59.974
Now get some sleep before
you wake up your sister.

28:01.976 --> 28:04.892
I hope the paint doesn't
peel off these walls.

28:04.935 --> 28:05.632
Man.

28:18.340 --> 28:20.908
Everything OK?

28:20.951 --> 28:21.952
Yeah.

28:21.996 --> 28:25.260
A new place, lots going on.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.480
Kids are just getting spooked.

28:27.523 --> 28:30.178
It's nothing I couldn't
have predicted.

28:31.875 --> 28:34.051
I'm a little worried
about Gabby, though.

28:34.095 --> 28:35.749
She seemed to really
believe what she

28:35.792 --> 28:37.620
was saying about your father.

28:37.664 --> 28:39.361
She's just acting out.

28:39.405 --> 28:42.277
Yeah, I'm sure you're right.

28:45.541 --> 28:48.936
Well, I think I'm going
to head on to bed.

28:48.979 --> 28:49.545
OK.

28:50.111 --> 28:51.286
All right if I
finish this chapter?

28:51.330 --> 28:51.939
Sure.

28:51.982 --> 28:52.635
See you in a few.

28:52.679 --> 28:53.375
Mm-hm.

29:43.556 --> 29:50.214
Jack, what are you
doing out of bed?

29:50.258 --> 29:50.998
Jack?

29:55.568 --> 29:56.351
Jack.

30:11.975 --> 30:14.500
God, Jack, that is not funny.

30:14.543 --> 30:15.544
What's not funny?

30:15.588 --> 30:17.633
I came because you
called my name.

30:20.027 --> 30:21.376
What's going on in here?

30:21.420 --> 30:23.291
I saw someone in
the hallway, and I

30:23.334 --> 30:26.903
thought they came in here, but
then they just disappeared.

30:26.947 --> 30:27.730
Great.

30:27.774 --> 30:28.470
You're seeing things too.

30:28.514 --> 30:29.732
Look, I know what I saw.

30:29.776 --> 30:31.995
Honey, I'm sure you
think you saw something.

30:34.868 --> 30:36.565
Stay with the kids.

30:36.609 --> 30:37.392
Kent.

31:44.633 --> 31:47.680
Don't even think of coming back.

31:47.723 --> 31:50.117
I have a gun, and it's loaded.

32:02.303 --> 32:04.392
You sure they didn't
steal nothing?

32:04.435 --> 32:06.307
Just busted up some stuff?

32:06.350 --> 32:08.396
As far as we can tell.

32:08.439 --> 32:10.616
Well, I'll go ahead
and take a report,

32:10.659 --> 32:13.706
in case y'all notice anything
missing in the morning.

32:13.749 --> 32:16.404
Not much else I can do.

32:16.447 --> 32:18.058
Who would do
something like this?

32:18.101 --> 32:22.802
It could have been anybody...
drunken teenagers, druggies.

32:22.845 --> 32:25.021
My most likely suspect
would be Mexicans.

32:25.065 --> 32:27.633
Lots of times, they get dropped
off just across the border

32:27.676 --> 32:30.287
without nothing, ending up
busting into folks' homes

32:30.331 --> 32:32.115
looking for food or
something they can

32:32.159 --> 32:33.377
pawn to make their way north.

32:33.421 --> 32:37.468
If was y'all, living
all the way out here,

32:37.512 --> 32:42.517
I'd invest in some better
locks, possibly even get

32:42.561 --> 32:43.866
y'all a firearm.

32:43.910 --> 32:44.475
No.

32:45.476 --> 32:47.696
We have children, we're not
having guns in this house.

32:47.740 --> 32:49.611
Suit yourself, ma'am.

32:49.655 --> 32:51.134
Thanks a lot, Sheriff.

32:55.008 --> 32:55.965
No problemo.

33:01.492 --> 33:04.060
OK, excitement's over.

33:04.104 --> 33:05.671
You two need to get to bed.

33:05.714 --> 33:09.239
You really should get a gun
dad, like an AR-15, or at least

33:09.283 --> 33:10.197
a Smith &amp; Wesson 500.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.981
He is not getting a gun.

33:12.025 --> 33:13.156
Go.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.070
Both of you.

33:15.855 --> 33:19.293
I'll stop by the hardware store
tomorrow and get some deadbolts

33:19.336 --> 33:21.425
on the way home from work.

33:21.469 --> 33:23.210
Could we get a dog.

33:23.253 --> 33:24.515
No dogs.

33:24.559 --> 33:28.868
Bed, sleep, now... don't
make me say it again.

33:28.911 --> 33:30.130
That worked.

33:42.664 --> 33:44.535
You seen my dress socks?

33:44.579 --> 33:46.886
They should be in the
drawer with your underwear.

33:46.929 --> 33:49.976
I might have put them
in the back though, why?

33:52.718 --> 33:53.588
No reason.

33:55.851 --> 33:57.418
You look like a nerd.

33:57.461 --> 33:59.072
I wish he was more like a nerd.

33:59.115 --> 34:01.552
Nerds are the ones that hire the
guys that picked on them when

34:01.596 --> 34:02.815
they were younger.

34:02.858 --> 34:03.685
Good point.

34:03.729 --> 34:05.078
Never mind, then.

34:05.121 --> 34:08.124
You might want to think
about that, wise guy.

34:08.168 --> 34:10.605
Doubtful.

34:10.649 --> 34:11.650
Well, I'm off.

34:13.564 --> 34:16.219
Don't give your mother
any more grief than usual

34:16.263 --> 34:17.177
while I'm at work.

34:17.220 --> 34:20.571
Talk about doubtful.

34:20.615 --> 34:21.311
Bye.

35:00.829 --> 35:01.525
Here.

35:01.569 --> 35:02.396
You can pitch for me.

35:02.439 --> 35:04.703
No, you can pitch for me.

35:04.746 --> 35:06.617
But you can never hit the ball.

35:06.661 --> 35:07.531
I can too.

35:07.575 --> 35:08.924
You just don't throw it right.

35:08.968 --> 35:10.665
Fine.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.449
I'll give you five tries.

35:12.493 --> 35:15.714
But if you miss them all,
you gotta pitch for me.

35:15.757 --> 35:17.193
OK.

35:17.237 --> 35:19.543
Remember... you miss them
all, you got to pitch for me.

35:19.587 --> 35:21.763
What if I hit five home runs.

35:21.807 --> 35:23.286
Shh.

35:23.330 --> 35:23.983
No fair.

35:24.026 --> 35:25.158
That doesn't count.

35:25.201 --> 35:26.246
I wasn't ready.

35:26.289 --> 35:27.464
You were in the batter's box.

35:27.508 --> 35:30.641
I'm not playing if
you're going to be mean.

35:30.685 --> 35:31.555
Fine.

35:31.599 --> 35:34.123
Five more tries starting now.

35:36.430 --> 35:39.694
Learn to throw.

35:39.738 --> 35:41.174
Don't need to.

35:41.217 --> 35:42.610
Ready?

35:42.653 --> 35:43.872
Yeah.

35:43.916 --> 35:45.178
You sure?

35:45.221 --> 35:46.440
Yes, I'm sure.

36:28.874 --> 36:30.179
Jack?

36:30.223 --> 36:30.876
What happened?

36:30.919 --> 36:31.833
It wasn't me.

36:31.877 --> 36:33.139
Gabby was holding the bat.

36:33.182 --> 36:35.271
It just slipped out of my hands.

36:35.315 --> 36:38.318
You both need to
be more careful.

36:38.361 --> 36:39.798
Come on.

36:39.841 --> 36:40.929
I need you both to help me
unpack some boxes anyways.

36:40.973 --> 36:41.843
Let's go.

36:41.887 --> 36:43.149
Why do I have to unpack boxes?

36:43.192 --> 36:44.498
She did it.

36:44.541 --> 36:46.674
Jack.

36:46.717 --> 36:48.719
Whatever.

36:48.763 --> 36:49.459
Ugh.

37:29.804 --> 37:31.284
Mr. Navarro, right?

37:31.327 --> 37:32.372
Call me Hector.

37:34.635 --> 37:37.246
OK, what can I do
for you, Hector?

37:37.290 --> 37:41.033
Dr. Layton wants
what you have so far.

37:41.076 --> 37:41.860
Sure.

37:47.648 --> 37:48.257
Here you go.

37:48.301 --> 37:49.563
Give him that.

37:49.606 --> 37:51.304
And tell him I'm about
2/3 through the samples,

37:51.347 --> 37:54.002
and there's an anomaly on 134.

37:54.046 --> 37:55.786
Little advice?

37:55.830 --> 37:56.700
Sure.

37:56.744 --> 37:58.354
Just give him what he asks for.

37:58.398 --> 37:59.486
Leave him alone.

38:05.796 --> 38:09.191
I've been hiding for
the last two minutes

38:09.235 --> 38:12.325
and you never found me.

38:12.368 --> 38:15.197
That's because I
wasn't playing, dummy.

38:15.241 --> 38:16.503
I told you that.

38:16.546 --> 38:20.333
Only because you
know you'd lose.

38:20.376 --> 38:21.551
Yeah, right.

38:21.595 --> 38:22.944
I find you in less
than a minute always.

38:22.988 --> 38:25.991
That's why I'm not playing,
because it's no fun.

38:26.034 --> 38:30.517
Jack, come here, please.

38:30.560 --> 38:32.040
See what you did?

38:32.084 --> 38:32.649
Me?

38:33.041 --> 38:34.260
You're the one who's yelling.

38:37.611 --> 38:39.308
Don't mess with my game.

38:49.579 --> 38:50.841
Yeah?

38:50.885 --> 38:52.452
I told you I'm working
on my grant proposal.

38:52.495 --> 38:54.671
Is it too much to ask for
five minutes without you

38:54.715 --> 38:57.196
and your sister trying
to kill each other?

38:57.239 --> 38:59.024
But she was the one bugging me.

38:59.067 --> 39:00.373
Did I ask you that?

39:00.416 --> 39:01.765
You're the older brother, Jack.

39:01.809 --> 39:02.984
I expect more out of you.

39:03.028 --> 39:05.508
Now, please, I just
need 30 minutes.

39:05.552 --> 39:06.988
Can you give me that.

39:07.032 --> 39:08.033
Fine.

39:08.076 --> 39:09.382
I'll be quiet.

39:09.425 --> 39:10.426
Promise.

39:10.470 --> 39:10.992
Good.

39:11.036 --> 39:11.732
Thank you.

39:19.566 --> 39:22.047
Oh, she is so dead.

39:58.431 --> 39:59.127
Hi.

40:01.738 --> 40:04.698
Hi from Jack.

40:04.741 --> 40:06.004
Now, please.

40:42.475 --> 40:43.171
Aha!

40:59.796 --> 41:00.797
Gabby?

41:00.841 --> 41:03.365
If you're up here, come out.

41:03.409 --> 41:08.370
I won't be mad about you
taking my controller.

41:08.414 --> 41:09.589
I promise.

41:23.733 --> 41:24.734
Mom?

41:24.778 --> 41:26.693
I'm sorry, but I
can't find Gabby.

41:26.736 --> 41:29.913
We were fighting because she
wanted me to play hide and go

41:29.957 --> 41:32.090
seek, but I wouldn't.

41:32.133 --> 41:35.789
So I think she took my
controllers so that I'd play.

41:35.832 --> 41:37.573
But now I can't find her.

41:37.617 --> 41:38.748
She's never this good at hiding.

41:38.792 --> 41:40.315
She's probably
just scared of what

41:40.359 --> 41:41.534
you'll do if you do find her.

41:41.577 --> 41:44.145
Yeah, but I told her
she could come out,

41:44.189 --> 41:45.190
and I wouldn't be mad.

41:45.233 --> 41:46.887
Maybe she didn't hear you.

41:46.930 --> 41:49.933
Maybe but I looked everywhere.

41:49.977 --> 41:53.285
What if that guy who broke
in last night came back?

41:55.243 --> 41:57.289
I doubt it, but come on.

41:57.332 --> 41:59.421
Let's go find your sister.

42:14.784 --> 42:17.961
What
are you doing here?

42:18.005 --> 42:19.746
Shh.

42:19.789 --> 42:20.355
It's back.

42:20.399 --> 42:21.617
The monster?

42:21.661 --> 42:23.706
You're not supposed to be here.

42:28.233 --> 42:30.322
All I bring is pain.

42:38.112 --> 42:40.636
Gabby, this is your mother.

42:40.680 --> 42:41.376
Game's over.

42:41.420 --> 42:44.901
Time to come out, OK?

42:44.945 --> 42:47.208
Gabby?

42:47.252 --> 42:48.035
Can you hear me?

42:48.078 --> 42:49.819
Come on.

42:49.863 --> 42:51.125
No more hiding.

43:02.484 --> 43:03.877
Did you do that?

43:03.920 --> 43:04.573
Do what?

43:04.617 --> 43:07.620
Close the cabinets.

43:07.663 --> 43:09.056
No.

43:09.099 --> 43:09.839
Swear.

43:23.505 --> 43:25.290
Gabby?

43:25.333 --> 43:26.116
Gabby!

43:35.256 --> 43:38.085
Gabriella Meredith, if you
did not come right now,

43:38.128 --> 43:39.956
you're going to
be in big trouble.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.697
Do you hear me?

44:06.766 --> 44:08.246
Gabby, what are you doing?

44:08.289 --> 44:09.159
Get down from there.

44:09.203 --> 44:11.074
Didn't you hear me calling you?

44:11.118 --> 44:15.731
And how in the world
did you get up here?

44:15.775 --> 44:17.255
What is wrong with you?

44:17.298 --> 44:18.734
I was hiding from the monster.

44:18.778 --> 44:22.912
There are no such things
as monsters, Gabby.

44:25.785 --> 44:31.399
Baby, what's the matter?

44:45.544 --> 44:46.327
Go.

44:46.371 --> 44:47.633
Go, go, go, go!

44:47.676 --> 44:48.764
What was that, Mommy?

44:48.808 --> 44:49.809
What was that?

44:49.852 --> 44:50.462
I'm scared.

44:50.505 --> 44:51.637
What did you see?

44:54.727 --> 44:55.423
Dad!

44:55.467 --> 44:56.163
Daddy.

44:56.206 --> 44:57.556
Hey, what's going on?

44:57.599 --> 44:58.383
Daddy.

44:58.426 --> 44:58.948
What's all the screaming?

44:58.992 --> 44:59.819
I saw something.

44:59.862 --> 45:00.472
There's something upstairs.

45:00.515 --> 45:01.211
Something?

45:01.255 --> 45:01.995
What kind of something?

45:02.038 --> 45:03.518
An animal?

45:03.562 --> 45:04.867
I don't... I don't know what
it was, a ghost, a demon,

45:04.911 --> 45:06.260
but I've never seen
something like it before.

45:06.304 --> 45:09.176
We need to get the hell out
of this house right now.

45:09.219 --> 45:11.787
Steph, calm down.

45:11.831 --> 45:13.136
You didn't see it.

45:13.180 --> 45:15.269
We did.

45:15.313 --> 45:16.226
All of you?

45:16.270 --> 45:18.098
Mm-hm.

45:18.141 --> 45:19.621
Jack?

45:19.665 --> 45:21.057
Well, Gabby peed herself and
Mom looked really scared,

45:21.101 --> 45:23.451
and I did see all the
cabinet doors upstairs

45:23.495 --> 45:25.018
close on their own.

45:25.061 --> 45:29.327
Like, what might happen with
weak hinges in an old drafty

45:29.370 --> 45:30.632
house?

45:30.676 --> 45:31.938
Kent, this had nothing
to do with old hinges.

45:31.981 --> 45:34.549
I saw something in the
hallway mirror upstairs,

45:34.593 --> 45:36.812
and then it was gone.

45:36.856 --> 45:40.686
OK, up here, right?

45:40.729 --> 45:41.991
Kent, don't.

45:50.652 --> 45:52.872
Look, there's nothing up here.

45:52.915 --> 45:54.439
It's like I told Jack.

45:54.482 --> 45:57.267
I believe you saw something,
but it's just not a monster,

45:57.311 --> 45:58.878
because they don't exist.

45:58.921 --> 46:02.011
I'm not saying it was a monster,
but whatever it was a human,

46:02.055 --> 46:03.926
and I don't want
to see it again.

46:03.970 --> 46:05.450
Steph, be reasonable.

46:05.493 --> 46:08.801
What's more likely... that
something passed by outside

46:08.844 --> 46:10.629
and put a weird
reflection in the mirror

46:10.672 --> 46:12.326
and Gabby's power
of suggestion just

46:12.370 --> 46:13.893
made your mind turn
it into something,

46:13.936 --> 46:18.158
or we have demons from hell
hanging out in the hallway?

46:21.117 --> 46:22.249
It's just the door.

46:22.292 --> 46:23.468
I'll get it.

46:23.511 --> 46:24.947
Why don't you go in
the kitchen and pour

46:24.991 --> 46:27.689
yourself a glass of wine?

46:27.733 --> 46:29.430
I don't need a glass of wine.

46:29.474 --> 46:31.693
I need to get out of this house.

46:31.737 --> 46:32.433
Honey, come on.

46:32.477 --> 46:33.303
You're scaring the kids.

46:33.347 --> 46:36.045
Maybe they should be scared.

46:36.089 --> 46:37.090
I'll tell you what.

46:37.133 --> 46:38.700
Have that glass of wine.

46:38.744 --> 46:40.659
If you still want to leave after
you've had a chance to relax

46:40.702 --> 46:42.661
and reflect, we will.

46:49.842 --> 46:51.539
Sweetie we're going
to get you cleaned up,

46:51.583 --> 46:54.237
and then we're going
to get out of here, OK?

46:54.281 --> 46:56.457
Good.

46:56.501 --> 46:57.066
Hi.

46:58.154 --> 46:59.591
Hey, sorry to bug you, but I
couldn't get you on your cell.

46:59.634 --> 47:02.463
Yeah, the reception's kind
of hit and miss out here.

47:02.507 --> 47:03.812
Well, Layton's freaking out.

47:03.856 --> 47:06.424
Thinks whatever you
found today could be big.

47:06.467 --> 47:07.512
He said that?

47:07.555 --> 47:08.687
No, no, man, he
said, it's nothing.

47:08.730 --> 47:10.297
It's nothing about
1,000 times, which

47:10.340 --> 47:13.996
is how he does before he ends
up publishing some big paper

47:14.040 --> 47:15.128
or whatever.

47:15.171 --> 47:16.608
Hmm, so what does
he want me to do?

47:16.651 --> 47:18.044
I mean, I've already
given my findings,

47:18.087 --> 47:20.612
and I called the lab to
request a duplicate sample.

47:20.655 --> 47:22.483
Yeah, he was hoping
you'd call the lab

47:22.527 --> 47:23.789
and put a rush on the duplicate.

47:23.832 --> 47:25.399
They're not really big
fans of his over there.

47:25.443 --> 47:27.401
He tends to rub some
people the wrong way.

47:27.445 --> 47:28.881
But if it was the
new guy asking,

47:28.924 --> 47:30.491
they might cut you a break.

47:30.535 --> 47:33.276
Well, they'll be closed by now,
but I can do it first thing

47:33.320 --> 47:34.234
in the morning.

47:34.277 --> 47:35.844
Cool.

47:35.888 --> 47:37.455
Just as soon as possible, or
the dude will drive me crazy,

47:37.498 --> 47:41.981
which then I'll have to pass
along to you, which will suck.

47:42.024 --> 47:43.548
Who's this?

47:43.591 --> 47:47.508
This is my wife Stephanie
and our kids, Jack and Gabby.

47:47.552 --> 47:48.248
Hey, guys.

47:48.291 --> 47:48.988
I'm Hector.

47:49.031 --> 47:50.076
I work with your dad.

47:50.119 --> 47:51.904
That's nice, but
we're just leaving.

47:51.947 --> 47:53.122
So if you could.

47:53.166 --> 47:55.298
Steph, seriously?

47:55.342 --> 47:56.952
Yes, seriously.

47:56.996 --> 47:59.564
I'm not having my children stay
one more night in this house.

47:59.607 --> 48:01.217
You're being ridiculous.

48:01.261 --> 48:03.393
Fine, but me and the kids are
going to be it somewhere else.

48:03.437 --> 48:07.180
Could I just talk to you alone
in the kitchen for a moment,

48:07.223 --> 48:08.311
please?

48:08.355 --> 48:09.791
One minute?

48:09.835 --> 48:10.575
Sure.

48:19.540 --> 48:21.150
You guys all right?

48:21.194 --> 48:21.673
Yeah.

48:21.716 --> 48:22.978
Yeah.

48:23.022 --> 48:24.458
What's going on?

48:30.420 --> 48:33.511
Steph, I know
you're scared, which

48:33.554 --> 48:36.035
is why I'm willing to
make a deal with you.

48:36.078 --> 48:37.776
If you go out there right
now and tell the kids

48:37.819 --> 48:42.432
that what you saw was just a
reflection of a passing truck

48:42.476 --> 48:44.130
and there's nothing
to be afraid of,

48:44.173 --> 48:47.350
then the next even minutely
strange thing that happens

48:47.394 --> 48:50.005
in this house, we'll leave...

48:50.049 --> 48:53.182
all of us.

48:53.226 --> 48:54.488
You swear?

48:54.532 --> 48:57.578
I don't know where we'll
go, but yeah, I swear.

49:02.365 --> 49:06.326
Look, there is always
a reasonable scientific

49:06.369 --> 49:08.589
explanation for everything.

49:08.633 --> 49:12.114
And now that I'm here, I'll be
able to see what you're seeing

49:12.158 --> 49:14.987
and help you understand
what it really is.

49:18.033 --> 49:20.296
I Hope you're right.

49:20.340 --> 49:23.604
But just in case, I'm going
to put an overnight bag

49:23.648 --> 49:26.041
in the car.

49:26.085 --> 49:27.695
OK, fine.

49:27.739 --> 49:30.306
And that's when I peed myself.

49:33.571 --> 49:35.747
I think you should
talk to my granny.

49:35.790 --> 49:36.878
She could help you.

49:36.922 --> 49:38.184
We don't need any help.

49:38.227 --> 49:39.620
Gabby and I just saw a
reflection of a monster

49:39.664 --> 49:41.579
off one of those
energy drink trucks,

49:41.622 --> 49:44.973
and I let my imagination
get the best of me.

49:45.017 --> 49:45.931
We'll be fine.

49:45.974 --> 49:47.846
Are you sure?

49:47.889 --> 49:49.543
I've been through it myself.

49:49.587 --> 49:51.240
When I moved in my
first apartment,

49:51.284 --> 49:52.633
things moved around
on their own.

49:52.677 --> 49:55.854
And every morning, my
oven door was open,

49:55.897 --> 49:57.943
even after I'd bungee corded it.

49:57.986 --> 50:01.903
So I called my granny, and
after she came over, all of it

50:01.947 --> 50:02.991
stopped.

50:03.035 --> 50:04.166
We're kind of broke
at the moment.

50:04.210 --> 50:05.298
We don't really have
money to be paying

50:05.341 --> 50:07.256
for psychics and witchdoctors.

50:07.300 --> 50:09.041
Well, she's not any of those.

50:09.084 --> 50:10.346
And she doesn't take money.

50:10.390 --> 50:12.697
I mean, sometimes people
give it to her, but...

50:12.740 --> 50:13.654
I'm sure they do.

50:13.698 --> 50:16.526
We'll be fine on
our own, though.

50:16.570 --> 50:18.180
See you at work tomorrow.

50:18.224 --> 50:19.878
If that's what you want.

50:43.597 --> 50:46.644
Why can't we go
back to Portland?

50:46.687 --> 50:48.167
Because we live here now.

50:48.210 --> 50:50.212
What about the monster?

50:50.517 --> 50:52.171
There is no such
thing as monsters,

50:52.214 --> 50:56.523
and that's the last I want to
hear of that from any of you.

50:56.566 --> 50:59.744
You are all scaring yourselves
to death for no reason,

50:59.787 --> 51:01.223
and it has to stop.

51:03.095 --> 51:04.444
You hear me?

51:04.487 --> 51:05.924
Yes, Daddy.

51:05.967 --> 51:06.707
Jack?

51:06.751 --> 51:08.013
Yeah.

51:08.056 --> 51:09.754
Good.

51:09.797 --> 51:12.408
Now eat your dinner.

51:28.816 --> 51:32.254
You going to give me the
silent treatment all night?

51:36.084 --> 51:38.565
Take that as a yes.

51:38.608 --> 51:41.176
Look, I was just doing
what I thought was right.

51:41.220 --> 51:44.266
Do you really want the kids
growing up seeing boogeymen

51:44.310 --> 51:46.225
behind every curtain?

51:46.268 --> 51:51.317
But if they do, I don't want
them to be afraid to tell us.

51:51.360 --> 51:52.840
I can't explain
to you what I saw.

51:52.884 --> 51:54.929
If you had seen it,
you would understand.

51:54.973 --> 51:57.149
There's something very
wrong in this house.

51:57.192 --> 51:59.934
What are you saying, that
my dad is haunting us?

51:59.978 --> 52:01.327
I don't know.

52:01.370 --> 52:02.241
I don't know if it's your
dad or something else.

52:02.284 --> 52:03.416
All I know is that...

52:03.459 --> 52:05.548
Kent, I'm not crazy.

52:05.592 --> 52:07.202
I saw something.

52:25.394 --> 52:26.482
Jack.

52:26.526 --> 52:27.135
Jack.

52:27.179 --> 52:28.920
What is it, Gabby?

52:28.963 --> 52:32.924
Can I sleep with you tonight?

52:32.967 --> 52:33.838
Why?

52:33.881 --> 52:36.362
The monster's back in my room.

52:36.405 --> 52:38.451
Dad said that there
are no monsters and you

52:38.494 --> 52:41.976
and Mom just made that up
with your imaginations.

52:42.020 --> 52:43.717
Now go back to bed.

52:43.761 --> 52:45.023
Leave me alone.

52:45.066 --> 52:46.111
I'm tired.

52:48.678 --> 52:49.897
Jack, look.

53:02.344 --> 53:04.869
You should show Mom and Dad.

53:04.912 --> 53:08.655
Dad would just yell at me
again and say I'm lying.

53:08.698 --> 53:11.614
But you're not, are you?

53:15.749 --> 53:16.489
Jack?

53:23.365 --> 53:24.540
What the hell?

53:24.584 --> 53:25.106
Dad!

53:25.237 --> 53:25.759
Dad!

53:26.194 --> 53:26.847
I thought I put a stop to this.

53:26.891 --> 53:28.240
Help!

53:30.895 --> 53:35.203
Open this damn door right now.

53:36.814 --> 53:39.729
Dad, help.

56:23.371 --> 56:24.285
Steph, wake up.

56:24.329 --> 56:24.851
Wake up.

56:24.894 --> 56:27.680
Mom, are you OK?

56:27.723 --> 56:29.116
Yeah.

56:29.160 --> 56:29.943
I'm OK.

56:29.987 --> 56:30.813
I'm OK, sweetie.

56:30.857 --> 56:32.163
I'm sorry.

56:32.206 --> 56:32.902
I'm sorry.

56:32.946 --> 56:34.513
Just go back to sleep.

56:42.434 --> 56:44.088
It's going to be OK.

56:44.131 --> 56:46.220
Everything's going to be OK now.

56:49.397 --> 56:50.137
Is it?

57:06.588 --> 57:07.937
What are you doing?

57:11.332 --> 57:13.334
What are you doing?

57:24.084 --> 57:26.739
You're not leaving us, are you?

57:26.782 --> 57:27.783
No, honey.

57:27.827 --> 57:29.002
I'll be right outside.

57:29.046 --> 57:30.960
I'm just going to
check on your mom, OK?

57:34.181 --> 57:35.443
Stay here.

57:35.487 --> 57:39.534
Don't let anyone in but
me or your mother, OK?

57:39.578 --> 57:40.274
OK.

58:35.851 --> 58:36.591
You OK?

58:39.899 --> 58:42.336
No.

58:42.380 --> 58:43.120
You?

58:47.428 --> 58:51.258
I gotta get to work soon.

58:51.302 --> 58:54.566
That's what you're
worried about?

58:54.609 --> 58:55.871
No.

58:55.915 --> 58:59.353
I just... I don't think
it's a good idea for me

58:59.397 --> 59:01.790
to lose our only source
of income right now.

59:01.834 --> 59:05.490
I was crossing my fingers hoping
our card would go through when

59:05.533 --> 59:07.013
I paid for the room last night.

59:07.056 --> 59:12.192
'K. If you're going in to
work, you need to ask that...

59:12.236 --> 59:14.977
the guy from last
night... what's his name?

59:15.021 --> 59:15.804
Hector?

59:15.848 --> 59:17.241
Yes.

59:17.284 --> 59:18.851
You need to tell him we
need his grandmother's help.

59:18.894 --> 59:19.939
Oh, come on, Steph.

59:19.982 --> 59:21.941
She's probably just
some sort kook.

59:21.984 --> 59:24.161
And Hector... he was in
jail at one point, OK?

59:24.204 --> 59:25.814
You left him alone
with our children?

59:25.858 --> 59:29.905
Well, it was just for stealing
a car when he was a teenager.

59:29.949 --> 59:33.779
I mean, he seems like a nice
enough guy, I guess, but...

59:33.822 --> 59:35.128
But what?

59:35.172 --> 59:38.262
You think you know better?

59:38.305 --> 59:41.874
What is your reasonable,
scientific explanation

59:41.917 --> 59:45.573
for what happened last night?

59:45.617 --> 59:48.185
I don't have one, OK?

59:49.882 --> 59:52.145
I always thought that people
who believed in ghosts

59:52.189 --> 59:55.017
were like people who believed
in Bigfoot or fairies.

59:55.061 --> 59:58.891
Well, I guess you were
wrong, probably because you

59:58.934 --> 1:00:00.240
don't know everything.

1:00:00.284 --> 1:00:01.415
I never said I did.

1:00:01.459 --> 1:00:03.069
You sure act like you do.

1:00:03.112 --> 1:00:07.204
First you don't believe me, and
now you want to turn down help.

1:00:07.247 --> 1:00:08.379
Why?

1:00:08.422 --> 1:00:09.771
Because you don't
think it's possible

1:00:09.815 --> 1:00:11.643
that someone else could
be more in tune with what

1:00:11.686 --> 1:00:13.688
we're dealing with than you.

1:00:13.732 --> 1:00:16.430
No, if you want
me to ask, I will.

1:00:16.474 --> 1:00:17.431
Good.

1:00:17.475 --> 1:00:18.476
OK.

1:00:18.519 --> 1:00:20.042
All I was trying
to say is I think

1:00:20.086 --> 1:00:21.740
we need to be very careful
with what little bit of money

1:00:21.783 --> 1:00:25.787
we have left and not
get our hopes up.

1:00:45.329 --> 1:00:45.938
Hey.

1:00:45.981 --> 1:00:46.547
Hi.

1:00:46.895 --> 1:00:48.375
I need to pick up your work.

1:00:48.419 --> 1:00:50.812
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1:00:52.727 --> 1:00:58.646
Hey, I'm sorry about last
night, if I came off a little...

1:00:58.690 --> 1:00:59.691
Dick-ish?

1:00:59.734 --> 1:01:00.257
Yeah.

1:01:00.300 --> 1:01:02.476
Yeah.

1:01:02.520 --> 1:01:03.390
Can we talk?

1:01:05.871 --> 1:01:06.915
Buy me a coffee.

1:01:06.959 --> 1:01:07.699
Done.

1:01:12.921 --> 1:01:16.969
So who did you ask
before you came to me?

1:01:17.012 --> 1:01:17.752
No one.

1:01:21.582 --> 1:01:23.845
Well, I did ask over at
the science department

1:01:23.889 --> 1:01:26.544
if they had anyone doing
paranormal research.

1:01:26.587 --> 1:01:27.414
Mm-hm.

1:01:27.458 --> 1:01:28.981
Yeah, and what did they say?

1:01:29.024 --> 1:01:32.245
That kind of science is only
done in the creative writing

1:01:32.289 --> 1:01:34.508
department here.

1:01:34.552 --> 1:01:37.685
Hey, listen, I've got to ask...

1:01:37.729 --> 1:01:43.822
you grandmother, she... she's not
going to scare my kids, is she?

1:01:43.865 --> 1:01:44.431
No.

1:01:45.127 --> 1:01:46.259
I mean, is there
anything about her that...

1:01:46.303 --> 1:01:46.781
that's...

1:01:46.825 --> 1:01:48.130
Nah, man.

1:01:48.174 --> 1:01:51.003
No, she... she helps
people stop being scared.

1:01:51.046 --> 1:01:53.092
She's really not what you think.

1:01:53.135 --> 1:01:54.354
Let me give her a call.

1:01:54.398 --> 1:01:55.790
Here.

1:01:55.834 --> 1:01:59.838
If she's home, which she
usually is right about now,

1:01:59.881 --> 1:02:01.318
you can meet her first.

1:02:01.361 --> 1:02:04.495
You'll see.

1:02:04.538 --> 1:02:05.452
Hey, Granny.

1:02:05.496 --> 1:02:08.194
Hey, it's your favorite nieto.

1:02:08.237 --> 1:02:10.414
No, the other one.

1:02:10.457 --> 1:02:12.720
Yeah, I get no love.

1:02:30.651 --> 1:02:31.304
I'm coming.

1:02:31.348 --> 1:02:32.523
I'm coming.

1:02:38.311 --> 1:02:39.138
Hi.

1:02:39.181 --> 1:02:40.922
You must be Mr. Peroni.

1:02:40.966 --> 1:02:42.097
Hi.

1:02:42.141 --> 1:02:44.273
You didn't tell me
he was so handsome.

1:02:44.317 --> 1:02:46.058
Is he?

1:02:46.101 --> 1:02:47.625
Never mind him.

1:02:47.668 --> 1:02:50.802
He learned his manners from
the state correction people.

1:02:50.845 --> 1:02:51.890
Come on inside.

1:02:56.285 --> 1:02:58.375
Now, y'all cop yourself a squat.

1:02:58.418 --> 1:03:01.029
I'll go get us some iced
tea, and then maybe you

1:03:01.073 --> 1:03:04.685
can fill me in on all I'm
sure Hector has left out.

1:03:04.729 --> 1:03:06.383
I'm sitting right here, Granny.

1:03:06.426 --> 1:03:08.297
I can smell you sweetie.

1:03:08.341 --> 1:03:09.211
No love... see?

1:03:09.255 --> 1:03:10.256
I get no love.

1:03:11.736 --> 1:03:13.564
And if I hadn't jumped
on him when I did,

1:03:13.607 --> 1:03:15.435
I don't know where it
would have taken him.

1:03:15.479 --> 1:03:18.699
That's a powerful energy
you're describing.

1:03:18.743 --> 1:03:20.135
That's what I like to call 'em.

1:03:20.179 --> 1:03:22.181
I went to that Einstein fella...

1:03:22.224 --> 1:03:24.052
you know how he said
he believed life

1:03:24.096 --> 1:03:28.579
had to exist after death, since
energy can neither be created

1:03:28.622 --> 1:03:29.971
nor destroyed?

1:03:32.409 --> 1:03:33.105
What?

1:03:33.148 --> 1:03:34.759
I said something funny?

1:03:34.802 --> 1:03:39.241
No, sorry, it's just... just
not what I was expecting.

1:03:39.285 --> 1:03:40.373
Told you.

1:03:40.417 --> 1:03:43.071
Well, yeah, but I
mean younger too.

1:03:43.115 --> 1:03:47.336
Oh, I had this one's daddy
when I was a little girl of 15.

1:03:47.380 --> 1:03:52.124
And Raul didn't waste no
time either, unlike someone.

1:03:52.167 --> 1:03:53.473
I'm only 24, Granny.

1:03:53.517 --> 1:03:55.736
Which I'm sure is
the number of girls

1:03:55.780 --> 1:03:57.956
you're with on a weekly basis.

1:03:57.999 --> 1:04:03.265
Look, I hate to be so blunt, but
do you think you can help us?

1:04:03.309 --> 1:04:04.832
I don't reckon why not.

1:04:04.876 --> 1:04:08.009
I've dealt with some rather
ornery energies in the past.

1:04:08.053 --> 1:04:10.621
Nothing quite like what
you describe, though.

1:04:10.664 --> 1:04:13.406
So what exactly
is it that you do?

1:04:13.450 --> 1:04:18.977
Well, the easiest way to put
it is I share myself with them.

1:04:19.020 --> 1:04:21.762
I let them inside me so
they know what I know.

1:04:21.806 --> 1:04:24.548
They're not living anymore,
and they should move on.

1:04:24.591 --> 1:04:27.594
I can't always get them too,
but once they know they're dead

1:04:27.638 --> 1:04:32.294
most stop doing the things
that are bothering the living.

1:04:32.338 --> 1:04:33.339
A lot are grateful.

1:04:33.382 --> 1:04:35.297
They have been
lost and confused,

1:04:35.341 --> 1:04:37.125
and I end that for 'em.

1:04:37.169 --> 1:04:40.999
It would be great if
you could do that.

1:04:41.042 --> 1:04:44.089
My kids, my wife...

1:04:44.132 --> 1:04:46.221
we're all just, um...

1:04:48.441 --> 1:04:50.748
At the end of your rope?

1:04:50.791 --> 1:04:51.966
I can see that.

1:04:54.578 --> 1:04:56.405
And I'm willing to try.

1:05:00.975 --> 1:05:04.501
But is there anything
you haven't told me?

1:05:07.678 --> 1:05:09.593
I think it might be my father.

1:05:09.636 --> 1:05:10.942
Doubtful.

1:05:10.985 --> 1:05:12.596
At least not on his own.

1:05:12.639 --> 1:05:16.425
I don't think a single energy
is capable of all you described.

1:05:16.469 --> 1:05:18.210
But why would you think that?

1:05:18.253 --> 1:05:21.692
He was a son of a bitch
when he was alive.

1:05:21.735 --> 1:05:23.998
I doubt dying made
him any nicer.

1:05:25.783 --> 1:05:31.963
Well, y'all sure you want
to go through with this?

1:05:32.006 --> 1:05:33.312
We are.

1:05:33.355 --> 1:05:34.618
Good.

1:05:34.661 --> 1:05:37.925
Then I need you to get
your whole family back

1:05:37.969 --> 1:05:39.405
to your house.

1:05:39.448 --> 1:05:44.715
If, like I think, we're
dealing with multiple energies,

1:05:44.758 --> 1:05:46.499
they tend to target individuals.

1:05:46.543 --> 1:05:50.372
And I'd hate for you all to move
back in with some of them still

1:05:50.416 --> 1:05:51.069
there.

1:06:01.819 --> 1:06:04.299
Guys, this is Hector.

1:06:04.343 --> 1:06:05.910
Remember him from last night?

1:06:05.953 --> 1:06:06.780
Hey, guys.

1:06:07.085 --> 1:06:09.348
And this is his
grandmother, Inez.

1:06:09.391 --> 1:06:10.175
Hi.

1:06:10.218 --> 1:06:12.177
Hi.

1:06:12.220 --> 1:06:14.614
You can call me Granny Inez.

1:06:14.658 --> 1:06:18.879
Everyone under 12 does.

1:06:18.923 --> 1:06:22.187
But not y'all, please.

1:06:22.230 --> 1:06:23.318
So what do we do?

1:06:23.362 --> 1:06:24.755
We just go in, or...

1:06:24.798 --> 1:06:26.974
No time like the present.

1:06:27.018 --> 1:06:28.062
I don't want to.

1:06:28.106 --> 1:06:32.501
Oh, sweetie, it'll be all right.

1:06:32.545 --> 1:06:33.894
Pinky swear?

1:06:33.938 --> 1:06:36.070
Is there any other kind?

1:06:39.726 --> 1:06:41.989
Everyone else good?

1:06:42.033 --> 1:06:43.425
All righty.

1:06:55.829 --> 1:06:58.440
Whoa, Grandma.

1:06:58.484 --> 1:06:59.224
You OK?

1:07:07.711 --> 1:07:11.758
Your father... he
wasn't a happy man?

1:07:11.802 --> 1:07:15.066
No, I told you.

1:07:15.109 --> 1:07:17.677
He ended that unhappiness here.

1:07:17.721 --> 1:07:18.678
How can you tell?

1:07:18.722 --> 1:07:20.288
Sometimes places
where bad things

1:07:20.332 --> 1:07:26.338
happen contain a certain residue
from energies changing form.

1:07:26.381 --> 1:07:28.993
Let's go inside.

1:07:29.036 --> 1:07:29.689
He's in there.

1:07:29.733 --> 1:07:31.343
I can feel him.

1:07:31.386 --> 1:07:33.606
You have keys?

1:07:33.650 --> 1:07:34.912
Yeah, we left so fast.

1:07:34.955 --> 1:07:36.609
I don't have the keys.

1:07:50.536 --> 1:07:51.755
You all can relax.

1:07:51.798 --> 1:07:54.714
I didn't mean he was
right behind the door.

1:07:54.758 --> 1:07:57.282
We'll probably have to
wait at least till dark

1:07:57.325 --> 1:07:58.413
to make contact.

1:08:00.633 --> 1:08:01.373
Come on.

1:08:24.788 --> 1:08:28.792
You said the strongest event
happened in Jack's room.

1:08:28.835 --> 1:08:29.749
That's right.

1:08:29.793 --> 1:08:31.446
Where's that?

1:08:31.490 --> 1:08:32.621
Upstairs.

1:08:32.665 --> 1:08:33.971
Can you show me?

1:08:34.014 --> 1:08:34.754
Sure.

1:08:38.889 --> 1:08:40.629
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

1:08:40.673 --> 1:08:41.848
y'all can stay put.

1:08:41.892 --> 1:08:44.546
I just want to get a
feel for the place.

1:08:44.590 --> 1:08:46.287
We'll be back presently.

1:08:48.333 --> 1:08:49.682
You guys want to play a game?

1:08:49.726 --> 1:08:51.336
Can we play Old Maids.

1:08:51.379 --> 1:08:54.382
Hector's real good at that one.

1:08:54.426 --> 1:08:55.470
Again, Grandma?

1:09:51.135 --> 1:09:52.005
What is it?

1:09:54.878 --> 1:09:56.880
I don't rightly know.

1:09:58.707 --> 1:10:03.190
I'm feeling a presence
I've never felt before.

1:10:03.234 --> 1:10:05.410
Like?

1:10:05.453 --> 1:10:08.500
Like I don't rightly know.

1:10:08.543 --> 1:10:12.896
Like I said, I never
felt it before.

1:10:12.939 --> 1:10:13.853
Not to worry.

1:10:13.897 --> 1:10:16.029
It doesn't always mean bad.

1:10:16.073 --> 1:10:18.553
Why don't we try another room?

1:10:24.037 --> 1:10:26.387
Hold on.

1:10:26.431 --> 1:10:28.955
Something happened out here.

1:10:28.999 --> 1:10:30.348
Steph and Gabby saw something.

1:10:30.391 --> 1:10:34.439
In the mirror, I know, but
this wasn't your father.

1:10:34.482 --> 1:10:37.964
This is... this is...

1:10:41.228 --> 1:10:42.882
What are you doing?

1:10:42.926 --> 1:10:44.753
Could it come out of there?

1:10:44.797 --> 1:10:45.711
Come out?

1:10:45.754 --> 1:10:47.844
No, it's not in there.

1:10:47.887 --> 1:10:49.149
It never was.

1:10:49.193 --> 1:10:52.152
But it's just like how
magicians use mirrors.

1:10:52.196 --> 1:10:54.067
It could trick y'all with them.

1:10:54.111 --> 1:10:56.156
I don't like to be tricked.

1:11:16.437 --> 1:11:20.311
OK, y'all grab
each other's hands.

1:11:23.009 --> 1:11:24.532
Concentrate on your grandfather.

1:11:24.576 --> 1:11:26.099
We'll start with him.

1:11:26.143 --> 1:11:29.929
Well, I could just
ask them to come out.

1:11:29.973 --> 1:11:30.451
Gabby.

1:11:30.495 --> 1:11:31.713
No, it's OK.

1:11:31.757 --> 1:11:34.412
How did he come out
when you asked before?

1:11:34.455 --> 1:11:35.239
I never did.

1:11:35.282 --> 1:11:36.501
He usually just finds me.

1:11:36.544 --> 1:11:39.460
Well, why don't you go
ahead and try, sweetie?

1:11:39.504 --> 1:11:44.509
Grandpa, will you come out?

1:11:44.552 --> 1:11:46.903
I don't think he heard me.

1:11:46.946 --> 1:11:47.773
That's OK.

1:11:47.816 --> 1:11:49.253
Try again.

1:11:49.296 --> 1:11:52.821
Grandpa, are you...

1:12:11.797 --> 1:12:13.320
Is she OK?

1:12:13.364 --> 1:12:14.234
No.

1:12:14.278 --> 1:12:14.800
Maybe.

1:12:14.843 --> 1:12:15.975
I don't know.

1:12:19.979 --> 1:12:22.286
Get out, or die.

1:12:22.329 --> 1:12:23.156
Granny.

1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:25.158
Get out.

1:12:25.202 --> 1:12:25.942
Get out.

1:12:32.818 --> 1:12:34.820
Granny?

1:12:34.863 --> 1:12:37.518
Why is your father
doing this to us?

1:12:41.522 --> 1:12:42.915
It's not him.

1:12:45.135 --> 1:12:49.269
He showed me something else.

1:12:49.313 --> 1:12:50.531
It's not human.

1:12:50.575 --> 1:12:52.359
We need to leave.

1:12:52.403 --> 1:12:55.275
What is it?

1:13:00.933 --> 1:13:02.630
Granny!

1:13:31.224 --> 1:13:34.749
It's from another world.

1:13:34.793 --> 1:13:38.101
Don't let it get a
body, or we'll all die...

1:13:38.144 --> 1:13:39.972
the whole planet.

1:13:40.016 --> 1:13:44.324
I never felt this much
hatred in my whole life.

1:13:44.368 --> 1:13:47.501
It's laughing at my pain.

1:13:49.329 --> 1:13:53.377
It thinks we can't
stop it from happening.

1:14:02.342 --> 1:14:02.908
No.

1:14:06.651 --> 1:14:08.479
Jack!

1:14:14.615 --> 1:14:15.355
Jack!

1:14:18.619 --> 1:14:20.099
Jack!

1:14:20.143 --> 1:14:22.754
Jack!

1:14:22.797 --> 1:14:24.451
Don't worry about me.

1:14:24.495 --> 1:14:29.630
You can't let it get a
body, no matter what.

1:14:29.674 --> 1:14:31.502
Do you hear me?

1:14:31.545 --> 1:14:32.894
No matter what.

1:14:32.938 --> 1:14:34.374
Yeah.

1:14:34.418 --> 1:14:36.333
Yeah, I hear you.

1:14:36.376 --> 1:14:38.465
Jack, dammit.

1:14:38.509 --> 1:14:39.249
Jack!

1:14:47.822 --> 1:14:48.997
What are you going to do?

1:14:49.041 --> 1:14:50.216
You heard Granny.

1:14:50.260 --> 1:14:52.392
You can't let it get a body.

1:15:08.104 --> 1:15:09.366
Kent!

1:15:09.409 --> 1:15:11.542
Stay with Gabby.

1:15:11.585 --> 1:15:12.717
Mommy!

1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:13.413
I'm OK, baby.

1:15:13.457 --> 1:15:14.110
I'm OK.

1:15:14.153 --> 1:15:14.936
I'm OK.

1:15:14.980 --> 1:15:16.851
Please don't hurt my son.

1:15:16.895 --> 1:15:17.635
Please.

1:15:52.365 --> 1:15:54.933
Jack, you have to
fight this thing.

1:15:57.457 --> 1:15:58.893
Please, Jack.

1:16:09.600 --> 1:16:10.340
Jack.

1:16:16.520 --> 1:16:17.521
Oh my God.

1:16:17.564 --> 1:16:19.653
What'd that thing
do to you, baby?

1:16:19.697 --> 1:16:21.699
Can you hear me?

1:16:21.742 --> 1:16:22.613
Jack.

1:16:38.629 --> 1:16:39.325
Oh.

1:16:42.067 --> 1:16:42.763
Sorry.

1:16:42.807 --> 1:16:43.634
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

1:16:43.677 --> 1:16:45.113
It's OK, sweetie.

1:16:45.157 --> 1:16:47.594
I know you had to.

1:16:47.638 --> 1:16:52.033
Kill him now while
you still can.

1:16:52.077 --> 1:16:53.644
This is my son.

1:16:53.687 --> 1:16:55.733
Not anymore.

1:16:55.776 --> 1:16:58.039
He's not even human.

1:16:58.823 --> 1:17:00.390
Don't you dare say that.

1:17:00.433 --> 1:17:05.569
Don't you... somebody
please help me.

1:17:05.612 --> 1:17:06.134
Jack.

1:17:06.178 --> 1:17:06.874
Jack.

1:17:12.053 --> 1:17:15.231
Steph, she's right.

1:17:15.274 --> 1:17:16.275
Move away.

1:17:16.319 --> 1:17:17.276
I can't.

1:17:17.320 --> 1:17:18.364
No.

1:17:18.408 --> 1:17:19.278
Please.

1:17:19.322 --> 1:17:22.716
Do you think I want to do this?

1:17:22.760 --> 1:17:27.591
That thing inside
him is too powerful.

1:17:27.634 --> 1:17:28.896
No.

1:17:28.940 --> 1:17:29.897
No.

1:17:29.941 --> 1:17:30.637
No.

1:17:49.569 --> 1:17:52.442
Dammit, son.

1:17:52.485 --> 1:17:58.317
Don't throw away your family
like I threw away mine.

1:17:58.361 --> 1:18:01.364
Whatever you may
have thought isn't

1:18:01.407 --> 1:18:05.716
half as bad as the man I was.

1:18:05.759 --> 1:18:07.935
I know where I'm going.

1:18:07.979 --> 1:18:12.244
And it's where I deserve to be.

1:18:12.288 --> 1:18:17.858
But I'm not going alone.

1:18:31.698 --> 1:18:33.657
Goodbye, sweetheart.

1:18:33.700 --> 1:18:35.223
Goodbye, Grandpa.

1:18:36.268 --> 1:18:40.359
Take Mom and Daddy
away from Jack, OK?

1:18:40.403 --> 1:18:41.055
Get back.

1:18:41.099 --> 1:18:42.230
Get away from Jack.

1:19:41.072 --> 1:19:41.942
They're gone.

1:19:41.986 --> 1:19:44.031
Grandpa took the monster away.

1:20:00.700 --> 1:20:01.527
She's right.

1:20:01.571 --> 1:20:04.312
Look at his eyes.

1:20:04.356 --> 1:20:06.140
I don't think he's breathing.

1:20:06.184 --> 1:20:06.967
He's not breathing.

1:20:07.011 --> 1:20:09.056
He's not breathing.

1:20:09.100 --> 1:20:09.840
Jack.

1:20:12.451 --> 1:20:13.191
Oh god.

1:20:21.460 --> 1:20:23.419
Come on, Jack, breathe.

1:20:23.462 --> 1:20:24.855
Come on, buddy.

1:20:24.898 --> 1:20:28.336
You can do it.

1:20:32.515 --> 1:20:36.083
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:20:36.127 --> 1:20:37.302
It's over.

1:20:37.345 --> 1:20:38.346
Put it down.

1:20:38.390 --> 1:20:40.653
What's over?

1:20:40.697 --> 1:20:42.350
What happened?

1:20:42.394 --> 1:20:43.874
It doesn't matter, sweetie.

1:20:43.917 --> 1:20:45.528
You're all right.

1:20:45.571 --> 1:20:47.530
That's all that matters.

1:20:47.573 --> 1:20:49.662
That's all that matters.

1:21:26.438 --> 1:21:28.745
So how's the leg?

1:21:28.788 --> 1:21:30.007
It hurts.

1:21:30.050 --> 1:21:31.661
Yeah, sorry about that.

1:21:31.704 --> 1:21:33.706
You were just doing what
you thought you had to.

1:21:33.750 --> 1:21:36.709
Why would you even bring
a gun to this house?

1:21:36.753 --> 1:21:38.145
Are you joking?

1:21:38.189 --> 1:21:39.233
I don't know you people.

1:21:39.277 --> 1:21:40.496
And besides, this is Texas.

1:21:40.539 --> 1:21:42.715
I bring guns everywhere.

1:21:42.759 --> 1:21:43.977
How's your grandmother?

1:21:44.021 --> 1:21:45.979
Well, her neck's broke,
so that ain't good.

1:21:46.023 --> 1:21:49.069
But she's talking, and she's
moving her fingers a little,

1:21:49.113 --> 1:21:51.507
so she's not completely...

1:21:51.550 --> 1:21:52.116
yeah.

1:21:52.508 --> 1:21:54.161
Ambulance should be here soon.

1:21:56.381 --> 1:21:58.818
What are we going to tell them?

1:22:00.603 --> 1:22:02.605
No, no, you stay here.

1:22:08.785 --> 1:22:09.568
What's going on, Granny?

1:22:09.612 --> 1:22:12.528
What's happening?

1:22:12.571 --> 1:22:14.704
Jack, where's Gabby?

1:22:14.747 --> 1:22:15.966
I don't know.

1:22:16.009 --> 1:22:17.489
Last time I saw her,
she was in the kitchen

1:22:17.533 --> 1:22:20.057
getting a juice box.

1:22:30.067 --> 1:22:31.503
There were two.

1:22:40.643 --> 1:22:41.948
Oh, no.

1:22:41.992 --> 1:22:45.865
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

1:22:49.652 --> 1:22:50.391
No.

1:22:54.613 --> 1:22:55.353
Gabby!

1:22:59.096 --> 1:23:00.271
Gabby!

1:23:00.314 --> 1:23:02.360
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

1:23:02.403 --> 1:23:03.796
What's wrong?

1:23:08.018 --> 1:23:10.498
Gabby!

1:23:10.542 --> 1:23:11.021
Gabby!

1:23:11.064 --> 1:23:11.761
Gabby!
