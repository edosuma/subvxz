<i>NARRATOR:
Kids, on my first day
as a college professor,</i>

00:09.634 --> 00:11.100
<i>there re two things
I didn't know</i>

00:11.100 --> 00:13.033
<i>that I wish did.</i>

00:13.033 --> 00:16.901
<i>The first thing was that your
mother was in that classroom.</i>

00:19.200 --> 00:21.300
The second thing?

00:21.300 --> 00:23.701
<i>Well, to explain tt,
we have to go back</i>

00:23.701 --> 00:25.033
<i>to the beginning of the summer,</i>

00:25.033 --> 00:26.534
<i>when, after a year of wrestling</i>

00:26.534 --> 00:28.033
<i>with their feelings
for each other,</i>

00:28.033 --> 00:32.033
<i>Barney and Robin
finally, well...</i>

00:32.033 --> 00:34.367
Whoo!
Lily, volume.

00:34.367 --> 00:35.534
Use your indoor "whoo."

00:35.534 --> 00:36.868
Sorry, whoo!

00:36.868 --> 00:38.200
It's jt they kissed!

00:38.200 --> 00:39.834
They're finally a couple.

00:39.834 --> 00:41.334
(gasps)
Oh, my God, you guys!

00:41.334 --> 00:44.200
This is our first double date!

00:44.200 --> 00:45.300
First of millions!

00:45.300 --> 00:46.767
What if our kids
get married?!

00:46.767 --> 00:48.000
Oh, I love this!

00:48.000 --> 00:50.901
Yeah... Lily, listen.

00:51.901 --> 00:53.968
Barney's awesome.

00:53.968 --> 00:56.400
Ron's more than
just awe-"some."

00:56.400 --> 00:58.033
She's awe-"quite a bit."

00:58.033 --> 01:00.467
She's awe-"a whole darn lot."

01:00.467 --> 01:02.000
Wait, what are you saying?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.834
We're just not
feeling it right now.

01:04.834 --> 01:06.567
But we'll totally
still be friends.
Oh, yeah.

01:06.867 --> 01:10.367
Is it something I did?

01:10.367 --> 01:12.400
Oh, no, no, no,
no, God, no.
No, no, no.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.567
Uh-uh.
Lily, it's not you.

01:13.567 --> 01:14.801
It'ss.
Yeah.

01:14.801 --> 01:15.934
It's us.

01:15.934 --> 01:17.101
You understand, right?

01:17.101 --> 01:19.168
Sure, of course.

01:19.168 --> 01:21.834
As long as you're happy,
I'm happy.

01:21.834 --> 01:23.600
(sobbing)

01:23.600 --> 01:26.700
We were gonna take 
cooking lessons together

01:26.700 --> 01:29.367
and we were gonna go
on camping trips together

01:29.367 --> 01:32.901
and then we were gonna sit
around telling funny stories

01:32.901 --> 01:36.201
about our cooking lessons
and our camping trips.

01:36.201 --> 01:38.967
I know, I know.

01:38.967 --> 01:41.201
(sobbing

01:41.201 --> 01:44.367
So, has the boat sailed
onex tonight or...

01:46.333 --> 01:49.634
<i>After that, the summer
went by way too fast.</i>

01:49.634 --> 01:51.300
<i>Until all of a sudden,
it was the Friday</i>

01:51.300 --> 01:53.333
<i>before my firsday
as a college professor.</i>

01:53.333 --> 01:55.834
Whoa, what's this?
Oh, boy.

01:55.834 --> 01:58.467
It's just a little something
that we got for you

01:58.467 --> 02:02.567
that used to belong to my
favorite professor of all time.

02:05.634 --> 02:07.034
A fedora.

02:11.967 --> 02:13.101
I'm Indiana Jones!

02:13.101 --> 02:14.600
I'm Indiana Jones!

02:14.600 --> 02:17.500
That, my friend,
is the Dominator 8000,

02:17.500 --> 02:20.300
the best bullwhip on the market,
according to my whip guy.

02:21.034 --> 02:23.467
Yeah, I have a whip guy.

02:23.467 --> 02:25.034
You know what we should do?
We should...

02:25.034 --> 02:28.101
Finish ourd rinks, go out
in the alley, and whip stuff.

02:28.101 --> 02:30.767
God, you just get me.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.734
Okay, I should get going.
I got a date.

02:33.734 --> 02:35.433
Oh, are you still
seeing that guy?

02:35.433 --> 02:36.500
Uh, even better,
seeing him naked.

02:36.500 --> 02:37.867
What!
Oh!

02:37.867 --> 02:39.134
I should go, too.

02:39.134 --> 02:41.333
I hooked up with this
Chinese girl last night,

02:41.333 --> 02:45.234
and I don't know, it's weird.
I already feel like seconds.

02:48.701 --> 02:50.000
Okay, Ted, you got first whip!

02:50.000 --> 02:51.034
All right.

02:51.034 --> 02:53.000
(imitating Clint Eastwood)
Hey, dummy.

02:53.833 --> 02:55.567
What did tell you
about smoking in here?

02:56.601 --> 02:57.701
Make him whip the habit!

02:57.701 --> 02:59.034
I'so excited
about this whip!

02:59.034 --> 03:00.501
I got whip fever!

03:00.501 --> 03:01.534
Just whip him, Ted!

03:01.534 --> 03:02.567
Don't even aim!

03:02.567 --> 03:03.534
Just whip him!

03:03.534 --> 03:04.833
I am so sorry.

03:04.833 --> 03:06.200
No, it's just the whip's
not a toy, Ted.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.833
There's such a thing
as common sense, you know.

03:07.833 --> 03:09.800
Hey, you can whip me
if you want.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.301
I will, some other time.

03:16.734 --> 03:18.634
Whoo!

03:32.701 --> 03:36.534
So, how long has
this been going on?

03:36.534 --> 03:38.233
(sighs)
All summer.

03:38.233 --> 03:39.367
I knew it!

03:39.367 --> 03:40.634
I knew it! I knew it!

03:40.634 --> 03:43.367
<i>You guys are boyfriend
and girlfriend.</i>

03:43.367 --> 03:44.534
Whoa, hey.
Whoa.

03:44.534 --> 03:46.100
Wow, no.
Whoa...

03:46.100 --> 03:47.367
Whoa, whoa, whoaLily.
Girlfriend?

03:47.367 --> 03:49.834
Slow your roll
there, Lilypad.
Yeah, yeah.

03:49.834 --> 03:52.434
You've been together all summer.
I dot get it.

03:52.434 --> 03:54.500
Okay, it's like this.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.100
After we kissed,
we sat down to have the talk.

03:57.100 --> 04:00.133
We should figure out
what this is.

04:00.133 --> 04:01.400
Yes, we should.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.500
Or.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.334
Or...

04:06.400 --> 04:08.734
<i>Okay, now, we have
to figure this out.</i>

04:08.734 --> 04:10.467
Yes, we do.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.334
Or. Or...

04:15.767 --> 04:17.166
Whoa!

04:17.166 --> 04:18.934
We kept trying to have the talk

04:18.934 --> 04:20.867
and then we realized
we hate the talk.

04:20.867 --> 04:22.467
Yeah, the talk sucks.

04:22.467 --> 04:24.534
You have to, like, talk.
(groans)

04:24.534 --> 04:26.267
And be all,
"I don't know.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.701
"It's not that
I don't like you.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.200
"It'sust that I haven't
had a girlfriend

04:29.200 --> 04:30.300
"in a really ng time.

04:30.300 --> 04:31.701
I hope it doesn't
make you mad."

04:31.701 --> 04:33.267
(groans)
Who needs it?

04:33.267 --> 04:34.701
You needs it.

04:34.701 --> 04:35.801
Guys, you can't

04:35.801 --> 04:37.034
just keep hooking up

04:37.034 --> 04:38.701
and not at least
try and fire out

04:38.701 --> 04:39.901
what you mean to each other.

04:39.901 --> 04:41.767
Yeah, we knew
you would say that.

04:41.767 --> 04:43.167
That's why we
kept it a secret.

04:43.167 --> 04:44.534
We, that and the fact

04:44.534 --> 04:47.267
that elaborate lies
really turn us on.

04:47.267 --> 04:49.200
No, no, no. No.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.068
You need tdefine
the relationship.

04:51.068 --> 04:52.667
You ne to have
the talk.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.167
Or. Or..

04:56.233 --> 04:57.801
(Robin and Barney moaning)

04:59.534 --> 05:00.901
I know what you're all thinking.

05:00.901 --> 05:04.101
"Who's this cool peer of mine
up in front  the class?"

05:05.101 --> 05:06.534
Well, I know the board says

05:06.534 --> 05:09.767
"Professor Mosby,"
but to you

05:09.767 --> 05:12.500
I'm Ted, huh?

05:13.267 --> 05:15.333
Question. Awesome.

05:15.333 --> 05:17.200
Hit it.
Yeah, here's my question.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.400
"Ted," who the hell
do you think you are?

05:21.233 --> 05:22.333
Yeah, "Ted."

05:22.333 --> 05:23.967
We're supposed to learn
from you?

05:23.967 --> 05:25.567
You failed as an architect.

05:25.567 --> 05:26.600
Well...

05:26.600 --> 05:27.534
And if you're a professor,

05:27.534 --> 05:28.901
where's your h
and your whip?

05:28.901 --> 05:30.367
They're at home.
I didn't think I'd need...

05:30.367 --> 05:31.834
And where are your pants?

05:33.068 --> 05:34.367
(laughter)

05:35.101 --> 05:36.767
Oh! (gasps

05:36.767 --> 05:37.867
Oh, God.

05:37.867 --> 05:39.967
Barney, it was awful.
I was teaching...

05:39.967 --> 05:41.567
Shh, Ted, now's
not a good time.

05:41.567 --> 05:43.734
Whe do you keep
your condoms?

05:47.267 --> 05:49.600
Okay, look, mistake #1

05:49.600 --> 05:51.400
was taking that
girl's question.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.333
You don't take questions
on the first day.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.367
It shows weakness.

05:54.967 --> 05:55.933
Mistake #2

05:55.933 --> 05:58.467
was you should've hit that.

05:58.467 --> 06:00.167
Dude, your pants
were already off,

06:00.167 --> 06:01.967
u had a classroom full
of people to cheer you on,

06:01.967 --> 06:04.301
and you n't knock her up
'cause it's a dream.

06:04.301 --> 06:05.768
Class dismissed.

06:05.768 --> 06:08.067
Mistake #3:
dude, where was the hat?

06:08.067 --> 06:10.434
Because if y're
not going to wear it,
I'm taking it back.

06:10.434 --> 06:12.501
I think what Barney's
saying is that

06:12.501 --> 06:14.000
definitions are important.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
You're their teacher,
not their friend.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.601
Exactly.

06:18.602 --> 06:19.602
If people don't know their place,

06:18.601 --> 06:19.668
nobody's happy.

06:19.668 --> 06:21.200
Amen.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.734
You have to make things clear.

06:22.734 --> 06:23.800
Run tell dat.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.967
Define the relationship.

06:25.967 --> 06:27.534
Yes! No!

06:27.534 --> 06:29.334
Lily, private convo time.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.833
Lily, can't you just
let us be happy?

06:35.833 --> 06:37.234
You're not happy.

06:37.234 --> 06:39.668
You just think you're happy
because you feel happy.

06:39.668 --> 06:41.534
And that's not happy?

06:41.534 --> 06:42.534
Of course not.

06:42.534 --> 06:44.567
You and Robin need
to have the talk.

06:44.567 --> 06:47.267
Why? Give me one good reason.
I'll give you 20...

06:47.267 --> 06:49.167
Wow, you can't even
think of one.

06:49.167 --> 06:50.467
Headlights. Deer.

06:50.467 --> 06:52.800
Lily, for the last time,

06:52.800 --> 06:56.134
things with me and Robin are
as good as they can possibly be.

06:56.134 --> 06:57.501
Oh, hey, look, Brad's here.

06:58.634 --> 06:59.734
I've got two tickets

06:59.734 --> 07:01.467
to the Rangers/Canucksame
tomorrow night.

07:01.467 --> 07:04.000
I know you're a hockey fan,
so I was tnking...

07:04.000 --> 07:05.668
Uh, oh, um...

07:05.668 --> 07:06.933
Uh...

07:06.933 --> 07:08.134
What do I have to do?

07:08.134 --> 07:09.534
Put a gun to your head?

07:11.234 --> 07:12.501
Buy you a six pack?

07:12.501 --> 07:13.833
Oh, come on, Brad, that's...

07:13.833 --> 07:16.034
Wow, there's really
six of them.

07:17.367 --> 07:18.734
Uh, t, uh, I can't.

07:18.734 --> 07:20.467
Why not?
You have a boyfriend?

07:21.867 --> 07:23.501
No. No, no boyfriend.

07:23.501 --> 07:25.434
Great! It's a date.

07:25.434 --> 07:27.900
Hey, Barn.
Hey, Brad...

07:35.501 --> 07:38.401
<i>Eventually, Robin and Brad
went to a hockey game.</i>

07:38.401 --> 07:41.634
You're probably wondering
why I've been quiet all night.

07:41.634 --> 07:43.367
Um...

07:43.367 --> 07:44.401
Damn it, Hordichuk!

07:44.401 --> 07:45.701
You miss another gimme
like that,

07:45.701 --> 07:46.933
I'm gonna come down there

07:46.933 --> 07:50.234
and put a slapper right up
ur beerhole! Come on!

07:50.234 --> 07:51.567
Not really.

07:51.567 --> 07:53.334
The truth is,

07:53.334 --> 07:55.634
I-I feel kind of weird
being out with you.

07:55.634 --> 07:57.200
Oh, man.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.467
Is this the talk?

07:58.467 --> 08:00.267
What?
No, this is good.

08:00.267 --> 08:01.867
Let's get it all
out of the way.

08:01.867 --> 08:04.267
Robin, I'm looking
for something serious.

08:04.267 --> 08:05.967
No, Brad, no, it's...

08:05.967 --> 08:07.768
But before we go any further,
you should know something

08:07.768 --> 08:10.034
about my stuff
below the belt.

08:10.034 --> 08:11.900
I was born
a little different.

08:11.900 --> 08:13.367
God, no, uh,

08:13.367 --> 08:14.833
Brad, no, um...

08:14.833 --> 08:17.668
This iabout
me and Barney.
You and Barn...

08:17.668 --> 08:19.800
Oh, oh, so you,
you guys are...

08:19.800 --> 08:21.367
Well, we-we-we don't
know what we are.

08:21.367 --> 08:23.200
I mean, my heart says
"leap into it."

08:23.200 --> 08:25.534
My brain says
"it's a bad idea."

08:25.534 --> 08:27.501
Sounds like you guys
need to have the talk.

08:27.501 --> 08:29.301
We're not gonna have the talk!

08:29.301 --> 08:31.768
Would you just
have the talk, okay?

08:31.768 --> 08:33.333
It's a five-minute conversation,

08:33.333 --> 08:35.067
and then you get
to have sex afterwards.

08:35.067 --> 08:36.933
It's great! Back me up, Ted.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.067
I don't think
the talk is necessary.

08:39.067 --> 08:41.267
What?!
Thank you, Ted.

08:41.267 --> 08:43.567
Because Robin is already
his girlfriend.

08:43.567 --> 08:44.867
What?!

08:44.867 --> 08:47.601
MacLaren's Bar,
four years ago...

08:48.401 --> 08:51.034
How do you keep a girl
from becoming your girlfriend

08:51.034 --> 08:52.600
Simple: the rules for girls

08:52.600 --> 08:54.134
are the same as the rulesfor gremlin

08:54.134 --> 08:55.534
"Gremlins"?

08:55.534 --> 08:57.234
Gremlins. Rule #1:

08:57.234 --> 08:59.067
never get them wet.

08:59.067 --> 09:01.501
In other words, don't let her
take a shower at your place.

09:01.501 --> 09:04.034
#2: keep them away
from sunlight--

09:04.034 --> 09:06.700
<i>i.e. don't ever see them
during the day.</i>

09:06.700 --> 09:09.501
And rule #
never feed them after midnight.

09:09.501 --> 09:11.134
Meaning she doesn't sleep over

09:11.134 --> 09:13.967
<i>and you don't have breakfast
with her ever.</i>

09:13.967 --> 09:16.468
What about brunch?
Is brunch cool?

09:18.234 --> 09:20.733
No, Ted.
unch is not cool.

09:22.067 --> 09:23.301
Ok, new topic.

09:23.301 --> 09:24.534
How do I pick a tie?

09:24.534 --> 09:27.067
<i>Simple: remember
in the movie Predator...</i>

09:28.067 --> 09:31.834
I've done all three
of those things with Robin.

09:31.834 --> 09:33.700
Is she my girlfriend?

09:35.468 --> 09:38.967
Just once, I wish you guys
would call me on Tuxedo Night.

09:40.367 --> 09:43.534
ANNOUNCER (over intercom):
Ladies and gentlemen,
time to pucker up

09:43.534 --> 09:45.534
for the New York Rangers
Kiss Cam!

09:45.534 --> 09:48.733
CROWD (chanting):
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

09:48.733 --> 09:49.967
Okayhow about this?

09:49.967 --> 09:51.834
If you kiss me and you
feel bad about it,

09:51.834 --> 09:53.067
you're meant
to be with Barney.

09:54.067 --> 09:56.201
Why not? Lay it on me.

09:56.201 --> 09:57.733
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

09:57.733 --> 09:59.568
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

09:59.568 --> 10:02.267
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

10:02.267 --> 10:03.568
Hey, Bd.

10:05.967 --> 10:07.401
Brad, we can't fight
like this all night!

10:07.401 --> 10:10.234
We both got some good shots in.
Let's call a truce!

10:10.234 --> 10:11.834
It's oy, dude.

10:11.834 --> 10:13.667
I shouldn't go kissing
some other guy's girlfriend.

10:13.667 --> 10:16.201
(laughing)
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, girlfriend?

10:16.201 --> 10:17.334
He come on.

10:17.334 --> 10:18.633
That's putting it
a bit strongly.

10:18.633 --> 10:20.534
A bit strongly.She's no
Okay, yeah.

10:20.534 --> 10:22.633
A gifriend's
a bit much, Brad, okay?

10:22.633 --> 10:23.800
(both laughing)

10:24.800 --> 10:26.301
Okay, seriously.

10:26.301 --> 10:29.167
We're at the point
of physical violence.

10:29.167 --> 10:31.501
Now, will you ease
have the talk?

10:31.501 --> 10:32.900
<i>Because of that?</i>

10:32.900 --> 10:34.667
Come on. That's  thing.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.568
I'm always punching guys.
Mm-hmm.

10:36.568 --> 10:39.334
Girls-- I'll punch a baby.
I don't care.

10:40.934 --> 10:43.401
<i>Finally, my first clas
had arrived.</i>

10:43.401 --> 10:44.700
<i>For real this time.</i>

10:44.700 --> 10:46.401
<i>I knew I had to make
a strong impression.</i>

10:46.401 --> 10:48.034
<i>I had thought of everything.</i>

10:48.034 --> 10:49.834
<i>Except...</i>

10:49.834 --> 10:51.967
<i>Wait. Does professor
have one "F" or two?</i>

10:51.967 --> 10:53.867
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

10:53.867 --> 10:55.167
<i>Professor.</i>

10:55.167 --> 10:56.534
<i>Pro-fess-or.</i>

10:56.534 --> 10:58.101
<i>They're all staring at me.</i>

10:58.101 --> 11:00.568
<i>Professor.
Uh, I don't know.</i>

11:00.568 --> 11:03.034
<i>Ju do something!</i>

11:03.034 --> 11:05.201
<i>Two "F's."
That looks right.</i>

11:05.201 --> 11:06.667
<i>I think that's right.</i>

11:23.501 --> 11:26.067
Hey, sorry I went little
too far last night.

11:26.067 --> 11:27.367
Oh, look, we've been over this.

11:27.367 --> 11:29.234
Unless I say "flugelhorn,"
you haven't gone too far.

11:29.234 --> 11:32.434
No, meant punching Brad.

11:32.434 --> 11:34.367
Oh, right. Look,
don't even worry about it.

11:34.367 --> 11:36.234
It's... oh. God.

11:36.234 --> 11:37.800
The doorknob's broken off.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.434
We're locked in here.

11:39.434 --> 11:41.434
Did, did you do this?
No.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.667
Flugelhorn.
Did you do this?

11:43.667 --> 11:44.834
No.

11:45.568 --> 11:49.000
Ted? Ted, are you out there?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.034
Ted's not here, Robin.

11:51.034 --> 11:52.800
Lily, let us out of here.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.167
I'd be glad to.

11:54.167 --> 11:57.167
Just as soon as you
and Barney have the talk.

12:01.301 --> 12:02.900
Lily! Come on.
Let us out!

12:02.900 --> 12:04.501
No. Sit down,

12:04.501 --> 12:06.633
define the relationship,
write down

12:06.633 --> 12:08.534
that definition
on a piece of paper,

12:08.534 --> 12:09.900
slip it under the door,

12:09.900 --> 12:12.501
and if I like what I read,
you can go.

12:12.501 --> 12:14.600
We are not
having the talk!

12:14.600 --> 12:15.633
Then you'll die in there.

12:15.633 --> 12:17.167
You're gonna
lock us in here?

12:17.167 --> 12:18.334
Well, guess what?

12:18.334 --> 12:20.733
Maybe we'll spend
the whole day having sex!

12:20.733 --> 12:22.401
Well, guess what?

12:22.401 --> 12:25.334
I brought Marshall with me,
so maybe we'll do the same.

12:25.334 --> 12:27.468
Hey, guys.

12:29.467 --> 12:30.600
<i>NARRATOR:
I still hadn't decided</i>

12:30.600 --> 12:32.567
<i>what kind of professor
I wanted to be--</i>

12:32.567 --> 12:34.867
<i>authoritative or cool guy.</i>

12:34.867 --> 12:39.234
<i>I thought I would decide
in the moment.</i>

12:39.235 --> 12:40.235
And I did. About 20 times.

12:39.234 --> 12:41.500
Good morning.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.834
'Sup, dudes?

12:42.834 --> 12:44.901
Silence!

12:46.034 --> 12:47.834
This is Architecture 101.

12:47.834 --> 12:50.634
I am Professor Mosby.

12:50.634 --> 12:53.333
But you can call me Ted.

12:53.333 --> 12:56.300
Professor Mosby.

12:56.300 --> 12:58.500
T-Dawg.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.634
Do not call me T-Dawg.

13:03.300 --> 13:05.467
Ner take questions
on the first day.

13:05.467 --> 13:06.901
It shows weakness.

13:06.901 --> 13:08.234
Also,

13:08.234 --> 13:11.201
don't look right here.

13:11.201 --> 13:12.400
(Barney chuckles)

13:12.400 --> 13:15.534
Okay, good luck. Byesies.

13:16.534 --> 13:19.467
<i>NARRATOR:
This was it:
my crossroads moment.</i>

13:19.467 --> 13:22.333
<i>What kind of professor
was I gonna be</i>

13:22.333 --> 13:24.067
<i>I had to decide.</i>

13:24.067 --> 13:26.934
Please save all your qstions
until the end of the lecture.

13:26.934 --> 13:28.367
(in high-pitched voice):
Thank you!

13:28.367 --> 13:29.467
Now...

13:29.467 --> 13:31.201
<i>NARRATOR:
Professor Mosby d arrived.</i>

13:31.201 --> 13:33.634
<i>Of course, if I had taken
that girl's question--</i>

13:33.634 --> 13:35.734
<i>who, by the way,was not your mo</i>

13:35.734 --> 13:37.333
<i>Your mom was sitting...</i>

13:37.333 --> 13:39.367
<i>Wait, let me finish this story
al quick.</i>

13:39.367 --> 13:41.400
<i>Here's what
that girl wod have said.</i>

13:41.400 --> 13:43.901
I'm sorry to bother you,Professor Mo

13:43.901 --> 13:46.600
but this isn't Architecture 101.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.333
This is Economics 305.

13:48.333 --> 13:50.134
You're in the wrong classroom.

13:50.134 --> 13:52.101
<i>NARRATOR:
Yes, I was
in the wrong classroom.</i>

13:52.101 --> 13:53.367
<i>And thus began</i>

13:53.367 --> 13:55.367
<i>the most humiliating
seven minutes of my life.</i>

13:55.367 --> 13:57.600
Here's your ink-about-it
for the day.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.134
Every single person
in this room

14:00.134 --> 14:02.801
is already an architect.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.834
Architect?

14:08.901 --> 14:10.168
Hmm. Ooh.

14:10.168 --> 14:12.001
"We're just hanging out."

14:12.001 --> 14:14.567
Just hanging out?

14:14.567 --> 14:16.500
Not good enough.

14:16.500 --> 14:17.934
Not good enough!

14:20.567 --> 14:26.234
Can anyone here tell me what
this class is really all about?

14:26.234 --> 14:27.801
Economics?

14:27.801 --> 14:29.433
(laughter)

14:29.433 --> 14:30.667
No. No, no. Don't laugh.

14:30.667 --> 14:33.101
He's not...
He's not entirely wrong.

14:33.101 --> 14:35.767
An architect must be economical

14:35.767 --> 14:37.801
in his use of space,

14:37.801 --> 14:40.600
so, well done.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.534
<i>Looks like somone's building</i>

14:43.534 --> 14:46.600
towards an A, huh?

14:48.101 --> 14:49.867
"We're seeing
where things are going."

14:49.867 --> 14:51.134
(laughs)

14:51.134 --> 14:54.101
<i>I'll tell you
where things aren't going--</i>

14:54.101 --> 14:55.600
out of that bedroom.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.001
Not good enough.

14:57.001 --> 15:00.300
Not good eugh!

15:00.300 --> 15:02.001
You--

15:02.001 --> 15:03.700
why do you want
to be an architect?

15:03.700 --> 15:06.300
I don't want to be an architect.

15:06.300 --> 15:09.034
Yes. Yes, exactly.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.134
It-It's not something

15:10.134 --> 15:11.333
<i>you want to be.</i>

15:11.333 --> 15:13.034
<i>It's something you need to be.</i>

15:13.034 --> 15:14.600
You dot have a choice, right?

15:14.600 --> 15:17.234
None of you has a choice

15:17.234 --> 15:19.500
No questions!

15:19.500 --> 15:22.234
"We're Barnman and Robin."

15:22.234 --> 15:24.600
(laughs)

15:24.600 --> 15:27.634
Oh, come on, you got to admit,
that's kind of funny, Lily.

15:27.634 --> 15:29.934
Not good enough.

15:29.934 --> 15:32.767
(shouting):
Not good enough!

15:33.767 --> 15:35.034
So if any of you

15:35.034 --> 15:37.300
have even
the slightest inclination

15:37.300 --> 15:40.567
to do anything with your life
other than become an architect,

15:40.567 --> 15:43.168
you're wasting my time
and yours.

15:43.168 --> 15:44.567
There's the door

15:44.567 --> 15:46.168
You can go.

15:52.234 --> 15:54.467
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:54.467 --> 15:56.168
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't-Don't all leave!

15:56.168 --> 15:58.034
Architecture's
fun! Look!

15:58.034 --> 15:59.268
I brought a hacky sack!

15:59.268 --> 16:00.534
MAN:
Sorry, I'm late, everyone.

16:00.534 --> 16:02.134
My name is Professor Calzonetti.

16:02.134 --> 16:03.667
This is Economics 305.

16:03.667 --> 16:05.201
You may return to your seats.

16:05.201 --> 16:06.500
(Ted laughs)

16:06.500 --> 16:07.700
Uh, sorry, sir.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.734
This is, uh, Architecture 101.

16:09.734 --> 16:11.867
Who invited their dad, right?

16:11.867 --> 16:13.567
CALZONETTI:
Young man,

16:13.567 --> 16:14.834
for the last 28 years,

16:14.834 --> 16:16.967
Economics 305 has been taught
right here

16:16.967 --> 16:19.634
in building 14, room 7.

16:19.634 --> 16:21.001
Uh, yeah.

16:21.001 --> 16:23.234
Buddy, I'm sure
200 architecture students

16:23.234 --> 16:26.034
and their professor
all got the room wrong.

16:26.034 --> 16:27.867
T-Dawg,
you're in the wrong room, bro.

16:27.867 --> 16:30.101
(laughter)

16:34.534 --> 16:36.700
Sorry. Coming through.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.567
Excuse me. Whoa.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.667
20 minutes late
on your first day?

16:50.667 --> 16:52.300
That's rough.
MARSHALL:
Mm.

16:52.300 --> 16:53.867
Yeah, but here's
the funny thing.

16:53.867 --> 16:55.567
<i>By that point,
I didn't have time</i>

16:55.567 --> 16:58.101
<i>to think about what kind
of teacher I was going to be.</i>

16:58.101 --> 17:01.400
<i>I just got up there
and talked about architecture.</i>

17:01.400 --> 17:02.634
And it was kind of great.

17:02.634 --> 17:04.268
That's awesome, Ted.
MARSHALL:
Yeah.

17:04.268 --> 17:05.333
Congratulations, buddy.

17:05.333 --> 17:06.134
Thanks.

17:06.134 --> 17:07.300
ROBIN:
Nice job, Ted.

17:07.300 --> 17:08.634
BAEY:
Hey, Ted, door five!

17:08.634 --> 17:09.733
(thump)

17:09.733 --> 17:11.634
Were you there?
Yeah, I got you,
buddy.

17:11.634 --> 17:13.867
They still haven't
had the talk, huh?

17:14.733 --> 17:17.700
I think I know
how to speed things up

17:17.700 --> 17:20.067
(sighs)

17:20.067 --> 17:21.500
(sniffing)

17:21.500 --> 17:23.567
Oh, not cool!

17:25.666 --> 17:28.167
Pancakes, fresh bacon.

17:28.167 --> 17:31.400
It is so yummy.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.834
Uh, dude,
I'm starving. Let's...

17:33.834 --> 17:35.567
Let's just have the stupid talk.

17:35.567 --> 17:37.001
Come on.
Fine.

17:37.001 --> 17:38.567
But

17:38.567 --> 17:40.101
how do these this even work?

17:40.101 --> 17:41.201
What do we say?

17:41.201 --> 17:43.367
(Lily clears throat loudly)

17:44.367 --> 17:48.168
Huh.

17:48.169 --> 17:49.169
Where do you see this relationship going?

17:49.168 --> 17:51.467
Oh, my God,
that sounds so cheesy.

17:51.467 --> 17:52.734
(laughin
I know, right?

17:52.734 --> 17:54.901
Totally. But, um,

17:54.901 --> 17:58.433
<i>where-where do you see
this relationship going?</i>

17:58.434 --> 18:00.901
I don't know.

18:00.901 --> 18:02.567
I mean,

18:02.567 --> 18:04.201
it's not like I don't like you.

18:04.201 --> 18:06.567
I just haven't had a girlfriend
for a long time.

18:06.567 --> 18:08.367
I hope
that doesn't make you mad.

18:08.367 --> 18:09.700
Mad?

18:09.700 --> 18:10.901
I feel the same way.

18:10.901 --> 18:12.201
I suck at relationshs.

18:12.201 --> 18:12.967
I mean,

18:12.967 --> 18:14.433
except with Ted.

18:14.433 --> 18:17.400
Man, he really got it right.

18:17.401 --> 18:18.767
I know it's a cliche

18:18.768 --> 18:22.134
but he really ruined me
for other men.

18:22.134 --> 18:24.668
<i>NARRATOR:
Of course, I wasn't in the room
for this conversation,</i>

18:24.668 --> 18:27.134
<i>but I have to imagine
Robin said something like that.</i>

18:27.134 --> 18:28.267
BARNEY:
Hmm.

18:28.267 --> 18:30.933
Maybe we should go back
to being jt friends.

18:30.933 --> 18:32.401
Maybe.

18:33.267 --> 18:34.634
But, um,

18:34.634 --> 18:36.501
I don't want
to stop having sex.

18:36.501 --> 18:38.000
Oh, good. Me, neither.

18:39.833 --> 18:41.000
Yeah. Friends
isn't gonna work.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.467
Nope. Oh, we're not good
at being friends.

18:42.467 --> 18:44.100
We're nogood at being
in a relationship.

18:44.100 --> 18:45.267
Wh are we good at?

18:45.267 --> 18:47.501
I know something we're good at.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.800
I don't know. If we're
gonna do it again,

18:48.800 --> 18:49.900
I'm gonna need
some Gatorade, or...

18:49.900 --> 18:52.034
No! No, t that.

18:52.034 --> 18:53.601
(quietly):
Lying. Okay, think about it.

18:53.601 --> 18:56.167
We spent the whole summer lying
about being just friends.

18:56.167 --> 18:58.601
Why not just keep lying?

19:05.800 --> 19:07.200
Really?ROBIN:
Yeah.

19:07.200 --> 19:10.034
Really. We sat down.
We had the talk.

19:10.034 --> 19:11.567
Barney's my boyfriend now.

19:11.567 --> 19:12.900
And Robin's
my girlfriend.

19:12.900 --> 19:15.867
I know it sounds nuts,
but it feels good to say.

19:15.867 --> 19:18.900
We're both afraid of commitment,
but, the fact is,

19:18.900 --> 19:20.734
we also can't live
without each other.

19:20.734 --> 19:22.768
And if the alternative
is not being together,

19:22.768 --> 19:24.967
then it's worth taking
this risk 'cause...

19:25.768 --> 19:27.967
...she's awesome.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.434
And he's awesome.

19:29.434 --> 19:31.501
He looks nice in a suit.

19:31.501 --> 19:33.800
She can handle
her Scotch.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.467
He's my boyfriend.

19:35.467 --> 19:37.401
And she's my girlfriend.

19:43.634 --> 19:45.200
Oh!

19:45.200 --> 19:47.734
(shoutg):
Good enough!

19:49.067 --> 19:50.234
(both laughing)

19:51.234 --> 19:52.434
We are good. She bought it.

19:52.434 --> 19:53.933
Hook, line, and sinker.

19:53.933 --> 19:55.100
are good.

19:55.100 --> 19:56.200
Oh, totally. Mm.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.134
So, you want
to get some breakfast?

19:58.134 --> 20:00.967
You know, brunch actuall
does sound kind of good.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.833
Hmm. Well, lead the way,
sweetie pie.

20:03.833 --> 20:05.367
Wow! Flugelhorn.

20:05.367 --> 20:07.000
Yeah, that felt wrong.
Mm.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.200
Mm.
(laughs)

20:17.334 --> 20:20.367
You do realize
they were lying, right?

20:20.367 --> 20:21.933
No, Ted.

20:21.933 --> 20:24.334
They don't realize
they weren't lying.

20:24.334 --> 20:25.933
<i>NARRATOR:
And that's the story</i>

20:25.933 --> 20:29.234
<i>of how Barney and Robin became
boyfriend and girlfriend.</i>

20:33.267 --> 20:34.668
Oh, hello.

20:34.668 --> 20:36.334
Hello. Good evening.

20:36.334 --> 20:37.800
Hello. Don't get up.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.367
Didn't we meet on a yacht?

20:39.367 --> 20:41.000
Hello.

20:43.267 --> 20:45.034
What?

20:45.034 --> 20:46.234
Oh, no!

20:46.234 --> 20:48.967
Did I not tell you guys
that it was Tuxedo Night?

20:49.701 --> 20:53.734
Doesn't feel
very good, does it?
