<i>Tonight...</i>

00:03.641 --> 00:06.079
<i>on "MasterChef,"</i>

00:06.079 --> 00:09.620
<i>only the six most talented</i>
<i>home cooks remain‐‐</i>

00:09.620 --> 00:10.622
<i>Jeff...</i>

00:10.622 --> 00:11.924
That is delicious.

00:11.924 --> 00:13.761
There's no stopping you
right now, is there?

00:13.761 --> 00:15.765
‐ <i>Dino...</i>
‐ Christina: <i>You've got this</i>

00:15.765 --> 00:19.606
incredible expression
of food as art.

00:19.606 --> 00:20.608
<i>Eboni...</i>

00:20.608 --> 00:21.777
I'm blown away.

00:21.777 --> 00:23.781
You just cook
like a chef's dream.

00:23.781 --> 00:25.317
<i>Cate...</i>

00:25.317 --> 00:28.658
Continue cooking like this
and you could be
in the finale.

00:28.658 --> 00:30.528
<i>Yachecia...</i>

00:30.528 --> 00:32.532
Aarón: You're someone
to fear when it comes
to savory and sweet.

00:32.532 --> 00:33.734
You're gonna go far.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.170
<i>...and Jason.</i>

00:35.170 --> 00:38.043
This is one of the most
beautiful dishes

00:38.043 --> 00:40.582
‐ in "MasterChef" history.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

00:40.582 --> 00:43.654
‐ <i>But in the end...</i>
‐ Gordon: This is it.

00:43.654 --> 00:45.992
<i>just one will</i>
<i>claim the title of...</i>

00:48.096 --> 00:49.733
<i>...MasterChef.</i>

01:00.387 --> 01:02.057
‐ Hi!
‐ Aarón: Welcome, everyone.

01:02.057 --> 01:03.995
‐ Yachecia: Thank you!
‐ Cate: Great to be back.

01:03.995 --> 01:06.332
The competition is
getting so intense,

01:06.332 --> 01:08.203
<i>and it's definitely hard</i>

01:08.203 --> 01:10.040
because we've been here
for a long time,

01:10.040 --> 01:11.710
<i>so I miss my family.</i>

01:11.710 --> 01:13.046
<i>But they're my strength</i>

01:13.046 --> 01:16.085
<i>and the reason</i>
<i>that I'm still here.</i>

01:16.085 --> 01:19.091
And every time I'm cooking,
I'm channeling them.

01:19.091 --> 01:24.035
Tonight it is time
for your final
mystery box challenge.

01:24.035 --> 01:26.072
‐ Whoo!
‐ Eboni: Whoa.

01:28.577 --> 01:30.715
On the count of three,
lift those boxes.

01:30.715 --> 01:32.752
One...

01:32.752 --> 01:34.021
two...

01:34.021 --> 01:35.758
three, lift!

01:37.762 --> 01:39.700
Yachecia:
Oh! ( laughs )

01:39.700 --> 01:42.404
Cate:
Oh, my God!

01:42.404 --> 01:44.208
Eboni: This is
my baby handwriting.

01:44.208 --> 01:46.479
This is my dad.

01:46.479 --> 01:49.118
Christina: Tonight,
there are no ingredients

01:49.118 --> 01:51.255
under your mystery boxes,

01:51.255 --> 01:53.728
but there is
a little taste of home.

01:53.728 --> 01:56.165
( crying )

01:56.165 --> 01:58.269
Please, open those letters.

02:01.543 --> 02:05.050
"Jeffrey, Holden and I
are so proud of you
for following your dreams.

02:05.050 --> 02:07.054
<i>We both miss you terribly.</i>

02:07.054 --> 02:09.291
<i>I can't wait</i>
<i>to be a family again.</i>

02:09.291 --> 02:10.728
<i>Now finish this up</i>
<i>with a win.</i>

02:10.728 --> 02:13.466
<i>Love, Beth and Holden."</i>

02:13.466 --> 02:16.205
That's my little boy
right there.

02:18.409 --> 02:21.717
And the last I saw him,
they were a lot smaller.

02:25.558 --> 02:27.094
Yachecia:
<i>"Hey, Mommy.</i>

02:27.094 --> 02:28.898
<i>I miss you so very much.</i>

02:28.898 --> 02:32.237
<i>We are all so proud of you</i>
<i>for following your dreams.</i>

02:32.237 --> 02:34.576
Your whole life is
about feeding people.

02:34.576 --> 02:36.914
Now is your time to shine.

02:36.914 --> 02:38.584
<i>Love always, Treasure."</i>

02:40.922 --> 02:42.692
Dino:
<i>"Dear, Dino. Hi, son.</i>

02:42.692 --> 02:46.967
I want to begin by telling you
how proud Dad and I are of you.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.838
<i>From the struggles</i>
<i>you endured growing up</i>

02:48.838 --> 02:52.344
<i>to now being able to express</i>
<i>your artistic talents</i>
<i>and succeed,</i>

02:52.344 --> 02:55.050
you have proven
that you can do anything
you put your heart into.

02:55.050 --> 02:57.454
I love you, Mom."

02:58.891 --> 03:00.995
( sniffles, clears throat )

03:00.995 --> 03:02.431
Gordon:
Incredible.

03:02.431 --> 03:04.970
Tonight we want to see
each of you make

03:04.970 --> 03:08.777
an extraordinary dish
inspired from the love

03:08.777 --> 03:12.184
and the people
that placed those letters
under your mystery box.

03:12.184 --> 03:14.255
You got it.

03:15.591 --> 03:17.361
Now you'll all have
five minutes

03:17.361 --> 03:19.198
to shop in that
extraordinary pantry

03:19.198 --> 03:20.635
<i>for everything you need.</i>

03:20.635 --> 03:22.939
The winner of tonight's
mystery box challenge

03:22.939 --> 03:25.645
‐ gets a game‐changing
advantage.
‐ Yes.

03:25.645 --> 03:26.880
Gordon: Now,
is everybody ready?

03:26.880 --> 03:27.882
All: Yes, Chef.

03:27.882 --> 03:30.888
Your five minutes starts...

03:32.224 --> 03:33.727
...now.

03:37.669 --> 03:38.837
Where is it?

03:41.810 --> 03:43.079
Dried apricots.

03:43.079 --> 03:46.018
My partner has always been
so supportive of me,

03:46.018 --> 03:49.191
<i>so I'm thinking about</i>
<i>how I can tie together</i>

03:49.191 --> 03:52.999
<i>what I know are flavors</i>
<i>that my partner Nathan</i>
<i>loves to eat,</i>

03:52.999 --> 03:54.903
paired with techniques
that I've learned

03:54.903 --> 03:57.074
in the MasterChef kitchen
to elevate the dish.

03:57.074 --> 04:00.280
Man, there's only
six of us in here.
It feels so empty!

04:00.280 --> 04:01.349
You guys excited?

04:01.349 --> 04:03.152
Oh, man,
they've got no idea.

04:04.522 --> 04:07.996
‐ Boom, boom, boom.
I like this.
‐ Ready?

04:12.905 --> 04:15.210
Holy Santa Claus.
( bleep )

04:15.210 --> 04:16.546
What?

04:16.546 --> 04:18.550
Gordon: Jeff, that is
your amazing fiancée,

04:18.550 --> 04:20.420
and your baby, Holden.

04:22.157 --> 04:23.527
Hey, buddy!

04:25.564 --> 04:28.036
Gordon: Yachecia, it's
your daughter, Treasure.

04:28.036 --> 04:29.572
( laughing )

04:31.075 --> 04:32.077
I missed you!

04:33.514 --> 04:35.851
Gordon: Jason, look!
Your partner Nathan.

04:35.851 --> 04:37.889
Aah ha!

04:39.391 --> 04:41.963
Hi!

04:41.963 --> 04:44.736
Gordon:
Dino, look who's here.
Your mum, Susan.

04:46.038 --> 04:47.207
Oh, my God!

04:49.646 --> 04:52.084
( Susan crying )

04:52.084 --> 04:54.388
‐ I love you.
‐ I love you, too.

04:54.388 --> 04:56.258
Daddy!

04:56.258 --> 04:57.595
Punkin!

04:57.595 --> 05:00.601
‐ Hi, Daddy! How are you?
‐ How are you, kid?

05:00.601 --> 05:02.538
I missed you!

05:02.538 --> 05:05.176
Gordon: Eboni,
your daughter Symphony.

05:05.176 --> 05:06.412
( squeals )

05:08.182 --> 05:10.186
Hey, my baby!

05:15.531 --> 05:17.702
I had my daughter Symphony
when I was 16 years old

05:17.702 --> 05:19.973
and me and my husband and her
were living in a car

05:19.973 --> 05:21.810
in a Chicago winter.

05:21.810 --> 05:25.083
<i>So my daughter Symphony is</i>
<i>the reason why I have survived.</i>

05:25.083 --> 05:27.387
Oh, my goodness, baby.

05:27.387 --> 05:29.057
<i>This is so much motivation,</i>

05:29.057 --> 05:30.561
<i>because she's never seen</i>
<i>Mommy give up,</i>

05:30.561 --> 05:32.397
and I will not do it today.

05:32.397 --> 05:35.738
Well,
there's not a dry eye
in this kitchen.

05:35.738 --> 05:38.911
But in a moment,
seriously, y'all
have to get cooking.

05:38.911 --> 05:41.850
So, families,
we're gonna invite you

05:41.850 --> 05:45.356
to take a front‐row seat
up there on the balcony.

05:45.356 --> 05:47.194
‐ I love you. Have fun.
‐ I know you do, baby.

05:47.194 --> 05:48.697
I love you.

05:48.697 --> 05:50.601
Have fun up there.
It's a good view.

05:51.603 --> 05:54.943
‐ Jason: Bye!
‐ Gordon: Now...

05:54.943 --> 05:57.447
I don't think anyone needs
any more motivation, do they?

05:57.447 --> 05:59.117
All: No!

05:59.117 --> 06:02.758
Now, tonight,
you've all got 60 minutes

06:02.758 --> 06:04.829
to make a dish inspired
by your incredible
family members

06:04.829 --> 06:06.265
up there on the balcony.

06:06.265 --> 06:08.402
I won't let you down.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.975
Your 60 minutes...

06:10.975 --> 06:13.112
starts... now.

06:21.128 --> 06:23.032
Come on, it doesn't get
any more exciting than this.

06:23.032 --> 06:25.003
This is emotion on a plate.

06:25.003 --> 06:28.543
My baby girl's watching me,
so I gotta win this.

06:28.543 --> 06:30.514
I know how much
it means to me
to cook for my family.

06:30.514 --> 06:31.816
‐ Gordon: Yes.
‐ The fact that
they're watching

06:31.816 --> 06:33.720
in the biggest culinary
competition in the world,

06:33.720 --> 06:36.125
vying for a coveted spot
in the top five.

06:36.125 --> 06:37.662
Christina: Yeah,
but beyond that, guys,

06:37.662 --> 06:41.001
they haven't
seen their families
for three months.

06:41.001 --> 06:43.372
‐ I love you.
‐ Love you, too.

06:43.372 --> 06:45.076
Aarón: Wait till they see
how far they've progressed,

06:45.076 --> 06:48.517
how much more ability
and technique they have now.

06:48.517 --> 06:50.219
‐ How you doing, Mommy?
‐ You got this, son.

06:54.896 --> 06:57.167
Back home in Tampa,
Beth and I,

06:57.167 --> 06:58.269
we love having salmon
at the house,

06:58.269 --> 07:00.841
so I'm going to be doing
a soy curd salmon

07:00.841 --> 07:03.880
that's going to be over
a ginger‐spiced crème fraîche

07:03.880 --> 07:05.951
with pickled Asian pears.

07:08.824 --> 07:10.894
‐ Is the oven on?
‐ The oven's on, yes.

07:14.869 --> 07:17.173
I'm making a Brooklyn‐style
tagliatelle

07:17.173 --> 07:19.411
with a tomato cream sauce,
and a Sicilian meatball

07:19.411 --> 07:20.881
filled with a mozzarella.

07:20.881 --> 07:23.018
‐ You got this, Dino.
‐ I can't screw this up.

07:23.018 --> 07:25.323
I definitely cannot
screw this one up.

07:28.530 --> 07:30.032
‐ Yachecia!
‐ Yes, Chef!

07:30.032 --> 07:32.571
‐ Oh, that looks
like a gazpacho!
‐ Yes, Chef!

07:32.571 --> 07:35.176
I'm making a white gazpacho
with white grapes,

07:35.176 --> 07:37.013
and spicy grilled shrimp.

07:37.013 --> 07:39.552
‐ Okay, cool.
‐ This came to me
in a dream!

07:39.552 --> 07:42.457
And I've always
told my children
to live our their dreams,

07:42.457 --> 07:46.298
go big or go home,
and so this is my opportunity
to live my dream,

07:46.298 --> 07:48.202
and that's what this dish
is all about.

07:48.202 --> 07:49.271
Treasure, what do you think

07:49.271 --> 07:50.641
of your mom's
performance so far?

07:50.641 --> 07:52.578
I am so proud of my mama,

07:52.578 --> 07:53.914
just for even
taking a chance.

07:53.914 --> 07:55.249
That's what life
is all about.

07:55.249 --> 07:57.086
Aarón:
Stay on the course,
make yourself proud,

07:57.086 --> 07:58.957
and most importantly,
Treasure, all right?

07:58.957 --> 08:00.493
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ All right, darlin'.

08:04.902 --> 08:06.205
33 minutes, everyone.

08:09.411 --> 08:10.848
‐ Jason.
‐ Yes, Chef.

08:10.848 --> 08:12.551
‐ Tell us about the dish.
‐ We're actually going sweet,

08:12.551 --> 08:14.221
because Nathan loves sweets,

08:14.221 --> 08:16.526
so I'm gonna make my version
of a religieuse.

08:16.526 --> 08:18.530
I'm using a Meyer lemon
pastry cream filling,

08:18.530 --> 08:19.899
I'm gonna melt
some white chocolate,

08:19.899 --> 08:21.569
do a little white chocolate
whipped cream.

08:21.569 --> 08:22.705
So it's like a profiterole

08:22.705 --> 08:24.040
‐ Yes.
‐ with another one on top.

08:24.040 --> 08:25.544
‐ Yes.
‐ What was the last words,

08:25.544 --> 08:29.050
Nathan, of advice
you gave Jason
before he departed?

08:29.050 --> 08:31.088
‐ Watch the clock.
‐ Watch the clock.

08:31.088 --> 08:32.490
‐ Watch the clock.
‐ 25 minutes to get yourself

08:32.490 --> 08:34.060
in the top three.
Good luck.

08:34.060 --> 08:35.764
Thank you very much, Chef.
Thank you.

08:40.641 --> 08:42.176
‐ All right, Cate.
‐ Hi, Chef.

08:42.176 --> 08:43.847
Now, you've talked a lot
about your dad,

08:43.847 --> 08:46.619
‐ Yes.
‐ what an important
role he's played

08:46.619 --> 08:47.621
‐ in your life.
‐ Definitely.

08:47.621 --> 08:49.190
What are you cooking tonight?

08:49.190 --> 08:51.428
I'm making venison,
which we go hunting.

08:51.428 --> 08:53.700
I'm doing some fondant
butternut squash,

08:53.700 --> 08:55.637
and then I'm doing
a wild mushroom sauté

08:55.637 --> 08:57.975
with some morels,
that we also go hunting for.

08:57.975 --> 08:59.377
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐ And then to finish it off,

08:59.377 --> 09:01.649
a sour cherry compote
that I'm gonna smoke.

09:01.649 --> 09:03.218
‐ All right, Cate.
‐ I'm running. I'm running!

09:03.218 --> 09:04.755
‐ Let's go!
‐ Bye! Thank you!

09:04.755 --> 09:06.458
Hot. You want it
hot, hot, hot?

09:06.458 --> 09:08.663
Ten minutes remaining.

09:08.663 --> 09:10.934
You got a boyfriend yet?

09:10.934 --> 09:11.970
No.

09:11.970 --> 09:13.773
I'ma beat his ass
if you do.

09:15.176 --> 09:16.345
‐ Miss Eboni.
‐ Hey, Chef.

09:16.345 --> 09:18.617
I remember early on
in this competition

09:18.617 --> 09:20.821
you talked about how much
your husband loves lamb chops.

09:20.821 --> 09:22.123
‐ Right?
‐ Lamb. Yep, yep.

09:22.123 --> 09:24.094
I'm doing herb‐crusted lamb,

09:24.094 --> 09:25.998
with sweet potato fondant,

09:25.998 --> 09:28.002
and then I'm doing
Swiss chard underneath.

09:28.002 --> 09:29.337
Okay, so here's the deal.

09:29.337 --> 09:31.976
Symphony, your mom's never
won a mystery box challenge.

09:31.976 --> 09:35.116
‐ Is tonight her night?
‐ She's very comfortable
with lamb,

09:35.116 --> 09:36.519
so, yes, I think so.

09:36.519 --> 09:37.855
Miss Eboni,
stick with it, all right?

09:37.855 --> 09:39.792
‐ Make your family proud.
‐ Yes, Chef.

09:41.996 --> 09:43.399
Two minutes remaining.

09:47.541 --> 09:50.580
‐ That's it.
‐ Some incredibly
inspired dishes.

09:50.580 --> 09:52.216
When you think
about the first

09:52.216 --> 09:53.252
mystery box challenge
in this competition,

09:53.252 --> 09:54.320
and look at where we are now,

09:54.320 --> 09:56.024
the difference
is incredible.

09:56.024 --> 09:58.395
It's unbelievable.
You can see how much
they're progressing,

09:58.395 --> 09:59.865
how much they're learning,
and they don't want to let

09:59.865 --> 10:01.602
any of their family
members down.

10:01.602 --> 10:02.604
Looks good.

10:04.074 --> 10:05.544
Gordon:
Guys, you're down
to the last minute.

10:05.544 --> 10:08.048
Show off
to those family members
up on the balcony,

10:08.048 --> 10:11.254
and give those heartfelt,
inspired ideas

10:11.254 --> 10:12.791
a MasterChef‐worthy finish.

10:12.791 --> 10:15.229
20 seconds to go.

10:15.229 --> 10:16.231
Come on, Mommy.

10:18.636 --> 10:20.574
‐ Gordon: Ten...
‐ Judges: Nine,

10:20.574 --> 10:23.278
eight, seven, six,

10:23.278 --> 10:26.251
five, four, three,

10:26.251 --> 10:29.491
‐ two, one!
‐ And stop! Hands in the air!

10:29.491 --> 10:32.263
( cheers, applause )

10:38.242 --> 10:39.678
Christina:
<i>In tonight's challenge,</i>

10:39.678 --> 10:42.985
we asked all of you
to create a beautiful dish

10:42.985 --> 10:44.955
that reminds you
of your family.

10:44.955 --> 10:46.826
Now, while you worked
at your stations,

10:46.826 --> 10:48.663
we had a chance
to watch you cook,

10:48.663 --> 10:51.836
and taste elements
from each of your dishes
as you put them together.

10:51.836 --> 10:55.142
Aarón: There are three dishes
that we'd like to take
a closer look at.

10:55.142 --> 10:57.948
The first dish
that we would like to taste,

10:57.948 --> 11:00.854
it's visually stunning,
and it's a very balanced plate.

11:00.854 --> 11:03.760
It has all the elements
working in unison.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.597
Let's see if she can make
her daughter proud

11:05.597 --> 11:08.135
and get her first
mystery box win.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.304
( laughs )

11:09.304 --> 11:10.640
Please step forward, Eboni!

11:10.640 --> 11:13.680
‐ ( cheers, applause )
‐ Get it, girl!

11:13.680 --> 11:16.451
( squeals )

11:16.451 --> 11:17.754
Eboni:
<i>Having my daughter here</i>

11:17.754 --> 11:19.123
<i>is just what I needed</i>
<i>to get me motivated.</i>

11:19.123 --> 11:21.294
<i>I put so much love</i>
<i>into this dish,</i>

11:21.294 --> 11:23.766
<i>and now I'm in the top three</i>
<i>for the mystery box.</i>

11:23.766 --> 11:25.503
Oh, no, you better
get 'em, girl,

11:25.503 --> 11:27.841
'cause I showed up
to work, baby. Mm‐hmm.

11:27.841 --> 11:30.346
<i>I'm not cooking no more.</i>
<i>I'm cheffing it.</i>

11:30.346 --> 11:32.283
Miss Eboni, talk to me
a little bit about your dish.

11:32.283 --> 11:35.991
I did a nine‐herb‐encrusted
rack of lamb

11:35.991 --> 11:38.796
with gruyere,
sweet potato fondant,

11:38.796 --> 11:41.836
Swiss chard
and a red wine reduction.

11:41.836 --> 11:45.543
This right here
looks incredible.

11:45.543 --> 11:46.812
Oh, my lord.

11:46.812 --> 11:48.816
I don't know how you like
your lamb, Symphony,

11:48.816 --> 11:49.852
but that's how
I like my lamb.

11:49.852 --> 11:51.021
You go, Mom.

11:51.021 --> 11:52.524
Beautiful medium rare.
Look at that, guys.

11:52.524 --> 11:54.728
‐ Beautiful.
‐ I mean, come on.

11:58.168 --> 12:00.072
Mmm.

12:00.072 --> 12:03.111
The gruyere is giving
a beautiful seasoning
to the outside of the lamb.

12:03.111 --> 12:04.615
The flavor
of the herb crust,

12:04.615 --> 12:07.654
it still has that freshness,
that herbaceous punch,
which I just love.

12:07.654 --> 12:11.294
The fondant potatoes,
I don't know what y'all
are doing for Thanksgiving,

12:11.294 --> 12:13.298
but you need to have that
part of your menu.

12:13.298 --> 12:15.737
‐ 'Cause that's the real deal.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

12:15.737 --> 12:18.475
If I had to do something
different and tweak it
a little bit,

12:18.475 --> 12:20.479
maybe a tad more little salt
on the top part of the lamb,

12:20.479 --> 12:22.651
but amazing, amazing stuff.

12:22.651 --> 12:24.888
‐ I hope you bring this home
to your family, your husband.
‐ I will.

12:24.888 --> 12:26.659
‐ Great job.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

12:26.659 --> 12:29.698
‐ Nice job, Eboni.
‐ Cate: Good job, baby.

12:36.746 --> 12:39.384
The second dish
that we are dying

12:39.384 --> 12:41.287
to take a much closer look at,

12:41.287 --> 12:44.093
the plating is bright,
it's vibrant.

12:44.093 --> 12:49.538
This dish was
cooked by another mum
in the kitchen tonight.

12:49.538 --> 12:53.311
Step forward, Yachecia.

12:53.311 --> 12:55.917
‐ ( cheers, applause )
‐ Get it, Mommy!

12:55.917 --> 13:01.227
This is the most beautiful plate
I have ever done in my life.

13:01.227 --> 13:03.833
<i>And my daughter's here?</i>
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

13:03.833 --> 13:06.104
Get the smelling salts,
call the nurse,

13:06.104 --> 13:08.776
because I might go down.

13:08.776 --> 13:10.613
<i>Medic!</i>

13:10.613 --> 13:12.884
‐ That looks beautiful.
Describe the dish.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

13:12.884 --> 13:15.690
So, what we have here
is a white grape gazpacho.

13:15.690 --> 13:18.462
I've used some almonds
and pine nuts,

13:18.462 --> 13:20.800
garnished it
with a spicy grilled shrimp,

13:20.800 --> 13:23.238
and finished it off
with some micro greens,

13:23.238 --> 13:26.377
chilis and celery leaves.

13:26.377 --> 13:28.549
Let's get in there.
Tell me about that shrimp.
How'd you cook the shrimp?

13:28.549 --> 13:30.553
So the shrimp,
I have Himalayan salt,

13:30.553 --> 13:32.289
lots of paprika,
lemon zest,

13:32.289 --> 13:33.458
and then just grilled that.

13:35.930 --> 13:37.567
‐ It's delicious.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.771
You know, gazpachos
can be sort of plain Jane,
somewhat boring,

13:39.771 --> 13:41.609
but it tastes expensive.

13:41.609 --> 13:43.145
Cook on the shrimp
is delicious.

13:43.145 --> 13:44.480
It's translucent
in the center.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.585
The heat is there.
It's a tough one for me.

13:46.585 --> 13:47.821
How would I dissect that?

13:47.821 --> 13:50.459
A touch more acidic, maybe?

13:50.459 --> 13:53.599
But, Yachecia, I raise the bar
for my chefs on a daily basis,

13:53.599 --> 13:56.839
and I say I raise it
for you to jump over it.

13:56.839 --> 13:58.643
And visually tonight,
I think it's the first time

13:58.643 --> 14:00.547
I've seen you jump over my bar.

14:00.547 --> 14:02.283
‐ It looks beautiful.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

14:02.283 --> 14:03.986
‐ Great job. Well done.
‐ Thank you, Chef. Thank you.

14:06.659 --> 14:09.463
Good job, baby.
Killed that.

14:11.602 --> 14:14.942
The third and final dish
that we'd like to take
a closer look at tonight,

14:14.942 --> 14:18.783
the level of plating
and finesse on this dish

14:18.783 --> 14:21.789
shows some serious potential.

14:23.793 --> 14:25.128
Please step forward, Cate.

14:25.128 --> 14:27.499
Yay!

14:27.499 --> 14:28.970
Punkin!

14:28.970 --> 14:30.640
Heck, yeah.

14:30.640 --> 14:33.946
<i>I'm so pumped to have</i>
<i>my dad here to witness me</i>

14:33.946 --> 14:36.652
<i>get called to bring</i>
<i>my dish to the judges,</i>

14:36.652 --> 14:39.390
<i>and with him</i>
<i>as my inspiration</i>

14:39.390 --> 14:42.530
is just the best gift ever.

14:42.530 --> 14:44.166
Cate, tell me about it.

14:44.166 --> 14:47.741
So I have a chocolate and
chili‐rubbed venison loin,

14:47.741 --> 14:51.414
with a chestnut purée,
butternut squash fondant,

14:51.414 --> 14:55.657
wild sautéed morels,
and a smoked cherry compote.

14:55.657 --> 14:57.159
How did you cook
this venison?

14:57.159 --> 14:59.230
I just seared it
on each side,

14:59.230 --> 15:01.067
and then I finished
butter basting it

15:01.067 --> 15:05.309
with some thyme, rosemary,
garlic until it was perfect.

15:05.309 --> 15:07.947
‐ The cook on the venison
is gorgeous.
‐ Thank you.

15:12.456 --> 15:14.561
‐ I'm blown away.
‐ Thank you.

15:14.561 --> 15:17.132
The chili and the cocoa rub
around that venison

15:17.132 --> 15:19.370
is the perfect balance.

15:19.370 --> 15:22.309
That butternut squash fondant
with that hint of molasses,

15:22.309 --> 15:25.148
it's earthy,
it's sweet, and the acidity
from those cherries

15:25.148 --> 15:28.321
makes every bite
taste like perfection.

15:28.321 --> 15:31.094
‐ Thank you.
‐ Christina: Dad, let me
ask you a question.

15:31.094 --> 15:34.033
Does Cate cook dishes
like this for you at home?

15:34.033 --> 15:36.437
The venison, yes.
Not all that other stuff.

15:36.437 --> 15:39.110
‐ ( laughter )
‐ All this other
fancy stuff?

15:39.110 --> 15:41.080
Right, it'd be
mashed potatoes most likely.

15:41.080 --> 15:44.453
She's changed.
She's not the same girl
I saw three months ago.

15:46.124 --> 15:48.896
I don't have any comment
about how I would
make it better.

15:48.896 --> 15:50.967
Shut up. Thank you!

15:50.967 --> 15:53.138
‐ Nice job.
‐ Thank you so much, Chef.

15:53.138 --> 15:56.077
‐ Good job, Cate.
‐ Good job!

15:58.114 --> 16:00.118
‐ That was good, huh?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

16:04.995 --> 16:06.264
Gordon:
Tonight, only one of you

16:06.264 --> 16:07.901
can pick up
that huge advantage

16:07.901 --> 16:11.274
that will turn
this competition
on its head.

16:12.911 --> 16:15.248
The person who made us
the best dish of the evening,

16:15.248 --> 16:18.421
the home cook
that did us proud,

16:18.421 --> 16:20.726
that did their family proud...

16:21.929 --> 16:23.599
The winner is...

16:24.935 --> 16:26.437
Congratulations...

16:39.296 --> 16:41.768
The person who made us
the best dish of the evening,

16:41.768 --> 16:44.941
the home cook
that did us proud,

16:44.941 --> 16:47.279
that did
their family proud,

16:47.279 --> 16:50.118
did themselves proud...

16:51.588 --> 16:53.191
The winner is...

16:54.326 --> 16:56.197
‐ Cate.
‐ Whoo‐hoo!

16:56.197 --> 16:57.534
( cheering )

16:57.534 --> 16:59.436
‐ Good job.
‐ Thank you.

16:59.436 --> 17:00.973
I feel amazing.

17:00.973 --> 17:03.712
I just won
the final mystery box,

17:03.712 --> 17:07.452
<i>and on top of that,</i>
<i>my dad was here to witness it.</i>

17:07.452 --> 17:09.758
That's just the best icing

17:09.758 --> 17:11.995
you've ever had
on any cake before.

17:11.995 --> 17:15.135
Cate, well done.
Eboni, Yachecia,
great job, wow.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.939
On behalf of Christina,
Aarón, and myself,

17:16.939 --> 17:21.347
it has been incredible
to have your family members

17:21.347 --> 17:24.486
witness such absolutely
phenomenal cooking.

17:24.486 --> 17:26.090
But we have
to say goodbye to them,

17:26.090 --> 17:28.494
because we have got
some serious work to do.

17:28.494 --> 17:30.700
Family members,
please make your way down,

17:30.700 --> 17:33.939
and say goodbye
to these talented
individuals.

17:33.939 --> 17:35.308
‐ I love you.
‐ Oh, man.

17:35.308 --> 17:37.112
( both murmuring )

17:37.112 --> 17:40.285
During this journey,
I've had lots of highs
and lots of lows,

17:40.285 --> 17:43.358
<i>and got a little weary</i>
<i>along the way.</i>

17:44.794 --> 17:46.898
‐ Bye!
‐ <i>This was definitely</i>

17:46.898 --> 17:49.069
the thing that I need
to help me finish strong.

17:51.073 --> 17:54.246
Cate, you are now safe
from elimination.

17:54.246 --> 17:56.818
‐ Yay.
‐ Please head up
to the balcony.

17:56.818 --> 18:00.660
‐ All righty.
‐ Good job, Cate.
Congratulations.

18:02.496 --> 18:04.433
Now, as for
the rest of you,

18:04.433 --> 18:07.607
your next elimination
challenge begins right now.

18:10.111 --> 18:12.884
In this elimination challenge,
you're all gonna be working

18:12.884 --> 18:15.523
with one
of the culinary world's
most prized proteins.

18:18.061 --> 18:21.500
It is one of the most
consumed seafoods
on the planet.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.970
It is, of course...

18:26.243 --> 18:28.181
‐ ...salmon.
‐ Yummy.

18:28.181 --> 18:30.920
There are hundreds
of directions you can
go with this.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.525
Tonight, we want
to see all of you

18:33.525 --> 18:35.930
create a salmon dish
that is so stunning,

18:35.930 --> 18:38.535
elegant, so delicious,

18:38.535 --> 18:41.407
that it gets you
one step closer
to the finale.

18:41.407 --> 18:42.610
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ Yes, Chef.

18:42.610 --> 18:44.714
Tonight, you five

18:44.714 --> 18:48.789
<i>have everything you could</i>
<i>ever need to succeed.</i>

18:48.789 --> 18:51.193
Well, almost everything.

18:51.193 --> 18:53.565
( murmuring )

18:53.565 --> 18:56.437
Tonight, each of you
will have one thing

18:56.437 --> 18:59.276
that is different.

18:59.276 --> 19:02.650
You will each have
a different...

19:02.650 --> 19:04.587
amount...

19:04.587 --> 19:06.725
of...

19:06.725 --> 19:07.927
...time.

19:07.927 --> 19:09.831
( laughs )

19:09.831 --> 19:11.935
‐ So, Cate.
‐ Yes, Chef?

19:11.935 --> 19:13.437
The second
that clock starts,

19:13.437 --> 19:15.576
you're gonna shout
the name of the home cook

19:15.576 --> 19:18.281
that you want to give
one full hour of cooking to.

19:18.281 --> 19:20.185
‐ Okay.
‐ At 50 minutes.

19:20.185 --> 19:22.924
you'll shout out
another name.

19:22.924 --> 19:24.961
‐ Same at 40 minutes.
‐ Oh, lord.

19:24.961 --> 19:27.299
And then 30,

19:27.299 --> 19:29.203
and finally, 20 minutes.

19:30.205 --> 19:32.910
‐ Oh, dear God.
‐ I love you!

19:32.910 --> 19:35.081
Please, head back
to your stations.

19:36.785 --> 19:38.789
Cate has been one
of my biggest competitors

19:38.789 --> 19:41.761
so far in this competition,
so it's a little scary
having her at the helm.

19:41.761 --> 19:44.499
You know, she might choose
to try to knock me out.

19:44.499 --> 19:47.105
Cate, what are you thinking
about strategy‐wise?

19:47.105 --> 19:50.144
Strategy, I'm thinking

19:50.144 --> 19:53.619
I'm gonna send
my best competitors home

19:53.619 --> 19:55.956
because that's what's gonna
bring me down in this kitchen.

19:55.956 --> 20:00.465
So your strategy
is to target
the best home cooks.

20:00.465 --> 20:03.505
‐ Or the poorest attitude.
‐ Okay.

20:03.505 --> 20:05.141
If Cate calls your name,

20:05.141 --> 20:08.481
you will run into that pantry
and grab your ingredients.

20:08.481 --> 20:10.485
Now, Cate, I'm gonna
start that clock

20:10.485 --> 20:12.455
at 60 minutes.
When it starts,

20:12.455 --> 20:14.126
‐ shout the name.
‐ Yes, Chef.

20:15.161 --> 20:17.065
The clock starts...

20:20.038 --> 20:22.843
‐ ...now!
‐ Jason, start shopping!

20:22.843 --> 20:26.350
‐ Jason, you have 60 minutes.
Let's go!
‐ Thank you, Chef.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.321
‐ That's a shock.
‐ Jason, interesting pick.

20:31.828 --> 20:33.397
Too much time
is not always a good thing.

20:33.397 --> 20:35.001
Scallions.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.671
The judges, knowing
that I have the most time,

20:36.671 --> 20:37.740
they're gonna expect
the most out of me.

20:37.740 --> 20:39.076
Daikon.

20:39.076 --> 20:41.180
<i>I'm trying to think</i>
<i>of additional elements</i>

20:41.180 --> 20:43.952
<i>that will really show them</i>
<i>that I've made use</i>
<i>of my 60 minutes,</i>

20:43.952 --> 20:46.958
but at the same time,
have a focused, edited dish.

20:46.958 --> 20:48.729
‐ Aarón: Nice.
‐ Gordon: Please tell me

20:48.729 --> 20:50.365
‐ you've got the salmon.
‐ Yes, salmon.

20:52.268 --> 20:54.139
Okay, 60 minutes.
That's a long time.

20:54.139 --> 20:56.544
That guy could come up
with an amazing dish
in 60 minutes.

20:56.544 --> 20:58.815
‐ Nice, Jason.
‐ I think 60 minutes

20:58.815 --> 21:00.118
is almost a little bit
of a sabotage

21:00.118 --> 21:01.453
because there's almost a beauty

21:01.453 --> 21:03.257
in being 50 or 40 or 30,

21:03.257 --> 21:05.863
'cause then you have
10, 20, 30 minutes
to think about your dish.

21:07.533 --> 21:08.935
Eight minutes gone.
Stand by.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.539
Two minutes
till the next call.

21:10.539 --> 21:11.908
‐ Jason.
‐ Yes, Chef.

21:11.908 --> 21:13.612
Now how we
cooking this salmon?
Where we going?

21:13.612 --> 21:15.281
Um, salmon I'm gonna do
Vietnamese‐style.

21:15.281 --> 21:19.089
The marinade is turmeric,
ginger, garlic, and dill.

21:19.089 --> 21:21.293
So, semi‐final spot
looming round the corner.

21:21.293 --> 21:24.466
‐ Yes.
‐ I think she's mad
giving you the 60 minutes.

21:24.466 --> 21:26.738
With 60 minutes,
there's no way
that I can botch it.

21:26.738 --> 21:27.773
I think it's gonna be
a home run.

21:27.773 --> 21:29.276
Let's wait and see.
Good luck.

21:29.276 --> 21:30.278
Thank you, Chef.

21:31.815 --> 21:33.585
Cate, when we
get to 50 minutes,

21:33.585 --> 21:36.591
‐ we're gonna need
the next competitor.
‐ Yes, Chef.

21:36.591 --> 21:39.630
Aarón:
Five, four, three,

21:39.630 --> 21:41.668
two, one.

21:41.668 --> 21:44.807
‐ Give me a name.
‐ Eboni, start shopping!

21:44.807 --> 21:46.778
‐ Aarón: All right.
Wow, Eboni.
‐ Christina: Go, Eboni!

21:46.778 --> 21:48.314
Eboni:
<i>I'm so happy.</i>
<i>I got 50 minutes,</i>

21:48.314 --> 21:50.485
<i>thanks to Cate,</i>
<i>my Chicago sister.</i>

21:50.485 --> 21:52.322
My husband's grandmother
cooks salmon with me,

21:52.322 --> 21:54.493
<i>and it was always</i>
<i>so delicious.</i>

21:54.493 --> 21:56.296
So Eboni got this.

21:58.167 --> 22:00.839
Gordon: Here she comes.
Eboni has got her basket full.

22:02.776 --> 22:04.279
What's in there, Jason?

22:04.279 --> 22:06.784
Turmeric, ginger,
garlic, fish sauce.

22:06.784 --> 22:08.320
Mm, I love those flavors.

22:08.320 --> 22:09.456
Eboni, talk to me,
what do you have?

22:09.456 --> 22:13.097
I'm doing a citrus
crispy‐skinned salmon

22:13.097 --> 22:16.136
with an avocado remoulade
with a little bit
of bamboo rice,

22:16.136 --> 22:19.777
wilted spinach,
and some spicy smoked
pecans and almonds.

22:19.777 --> 22:21.814
‐ Who's gonna get the 20?
‐ Jeff.

22:21.814 --> 22:23.284
‐ Jeff?
‐ I'd bet a million on it.

22:23.284 --> 22:25.622
Will you bet
the MasterChef trophy on it?

22:25.622 --> 22:27.660
‐ No.
‐ No?

22:27.660 --> 22:29.764
Smart girl.

22:29.764 --> 22:31.300
‐ Gordon: Let's go.
‐ Aarón: Let's move.

22:31.300 --> 22:32.770
Cate: You guys
are moving quick.

22:32.770 --> 22:36.811
Cate, five seconds
until the next call‐out.

22:36.811 --> 22:39.482
Three, two, one.

22:39.482 --> 22:41.688
Yachecia, start shopping,
girlfriend!

22:43.057 --> 22:44.527
‐ There goes Yachecia.
‐ Yup.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.702
Oh, dear lord.

22:48.702 --> 22:50.304
Aarón: <i>Yachecia,</i>
<i>40 minutes.</i>

22:50.304 --> 22:52.543
See, that's the perfect time
to cook a piece of salmon.

22:52.543 --> 22:55.014
Okay, it takes eight to ten
minutes to cook the salmon,

22:55.014 --> 22:56.651
then you got a good
15 to 20 minutes...

22:56.651 --> 23:00.826
‐ To get the rest of it.
‐ Yeah, to get your
garnishes started.

23:00.826 --> 23:02.262
‐ Here's Yachecia.
‐ Come on, Yachecia.

23:02.262 --> 23:03.765
Christina:
All right, mama,
you got the salmon?

23:03.765 --> 23:06.671
‐ It's in there.
‐ Nice colors.

23:06.671 --> 23:10.679
Make sure these dishes
are MasterChef‐worthy, guys.

23:10.679 --> 23:12.516
‐ Heard?
‐ Yes, Chef.

23:12.516 --> 23:14.620
‐ Yachecia,
what are you making?
‐ Yes, ma'am.

23:14.620 --> 23:16.356
So, I'm going to do
a play on sweet and sour.

23:16.356 --> 23:18.795
So I got a honey‐chipotle
marinade on my salmon,

23:18.795 --> 23:20.799
and then I'm gonna serve that
with some Tuscan white beans,

23:20.799 --> 23:23.738
with a grapefruit
crème fraîche vinaigrette.

23:23.738 --> 23:25.976
‐ Did you dream
about this dish?
‐ I did dream about this one.

23:25.976 --> 23:28.180
And the last dream got me
in the top three, so...

23:28.180 --> 23:29.717
The last dream got you
in the top three, okay.

23:29.717 --> 23:31.654
Make sure you're
tasting everything.

23:31.654 --> 23:34.192
Make sure that those
flavors are in harmony,
that they're dreamlike.

23:34.192 --> 23:35.562
I want to take you
to my dream with me.

23:35.562 --> 23:37.332
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

23:43.578 --> 23:45.782
‐ Tasting good?
‐ Hallelujah,
this is delicious.

23:45.782 --> 23:47.051
I like those flavors.

23:47.051 --> 23:49.790
Gordon: Dino, stand by.
Jeff, stand by.

23:49.790 --> 23:52.596
One of you will
get 30 minutes.

23:52.596 --> 23:55.201
One of you will be left
with just 20 minutes

23:55.201 --> 23:58.140
to get yourself
into the semi‐final.

23:58.140 --> 24:00.879
Dino:
<i>Cate says she's trying to give</i>
<i>the short amount of time</i>

24:00.879 --> 24:02.516
to the person with the worst
type of attitude here,

24:02.516 --> 24:04.587
and I really hope she's
talking about Jeff,

24:04.587 --> 24:07.926
<i>because 20 minutes</i>
<i>is nearly impossible.</i>

24:07.926 --> 24:09.930
Cate, ten seconds to go.

24:11.768 --> 24:13.270
Five, four,

24:13.270 --> 24:15.942
three, two, one.

24:21.119 --> 24:23.424
Dino, stand by.
Jeff, stand by.

24:23.424 --> 24:26.263
One of you will be left
with just 20 minutes

24:26.263 --> 24:28.300
to get yourself
into the semi‐final.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.607
Cate, five, four,

24:31.607 --> 24:34.245
three, two, one.

24:34.245 --> 24:36.984
‐ Dino, baby doll,
start shopping!
‐ Ow!

24:39.055 --> 24:41.894
Ah, baby doll!
All right! Ow!

24:41.894 --> 24:43.598
I'm so glad
I got 30 minutes.

24:43.598 --> 24:46.403
<i>Thank you so much, Cate.</i>

24:46.403 --> 24:47.573
There you are, baby.

24:47.573 --> 24:51.279
If I can't cook
a MasterChef‐worthy dish

24:51.279 --> 24:53.250
in a half an hour,

24:53.250 --> 24:54.587
I don't deserve to be here.

24:54.587 --> 24:56.924
‐ Have you got your salmon?
‐ Right here, Chef.

24:56.924 --> 24:58.661
Let's go.

24:58.661 --> 25:00.331
‐ Aarón: Get moving, Dino.
‐ Cate: You're a speed
demon, Dino.

25:05.274 --> 25:06.878
Cate:
Is that a crème fraîche,
Yachecia?

25:06.878 --> 25:08.615
‐ Crème fraîche
and Greek yogurt.
‐ Very cool.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.052
‐ Dino, what's going on?
‐ Yes, Chef.

25:11.052 --> 25:12.623
I'm making
a veggie wrap salmon.

25:12.623 --> 25:14.560
I'm gonna do it on
a bed of fregola.

25:14.560 --> 25:17.566
‐ Okay.
‐ With a lemon cream sauce
and dill and rosemary.

25:17.566 --> 25:19.503
This is my family right here.
Classic Italian.

25:19.503 --> 25:21.239
‐ All right, Dino, look.
‐ Yes, Chef.

25:21.239 --> 25:23.176
‐ You gotta focus, okay?
‐ Yes, Chef.

25:23.176 --> 25:24.680
Good luck.

25:24.680 --> 25:25.682
Christina:
You gotta move, guys.

25:25.682 --> 25:27.485
Aarón:
Come on, Jason, let's go.

25:29.857 --> 25:30.859
Aah!

25:32.863 --> 25:34.833
‐ Gordon: This is intense.
‐ Aarón: Unbelievable.

25:34.833 --> 25:37.839
What a hand Cate
has dealt to Jeff.

25:37.839 --> 25:39.543
Stand by, Jeff.

25:39.543 --> 25:42.315
Cate, five, four,

25:42.315 --> 25:44.720
three, two, one.

25:44.720 --> 25:46.323
Jeff, start shopping.

25:46.323 --> 25:49.162
‐ Whoa.
‐ Whoa!

25:49.162 --> 25:51.701
Aarón:
He's feeling the pressure
big time, Christina.

25:51.701 --> 25:54.873
Cate, why 20 minutes to Jeff?

25:54.873 --> 25:56.176
Cate:
His attitude is poor, so,

25:56.176 --> 25:57.345
I want to send him home.

25:58.347 --> 25:59.883
Cate wants me to go home.

25:59.883 --> 26:01.554
<i>She's going</i>
<i>to fail miserably.</i>

26:01.554 --> 26:02.656
Lemon, butter.

26:02.656 --> 26:05.695
Certainly, I am one
of the top chefs here.

26:05.695 --> 26:08.835
I know I can make
a 20‐minute dish like no other.

26:12.008 --> 26:13.845
Let's go, young man.

26:16.216 --> 26:19.355
He's got barely
15 minutes to cook.

26:19.355 --> 26:21.560
‐ Aarón: Unreal.
‐ I've got no idea how
he's gonna pull this off.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.998
‐ Christina:
You gotta move, Jeff.
‐ Aarón: Let's go. Come on!

26:23.998 --> 26:27.405
‐ Let's go, let's go.
‐ Keep moving, guys.
Keep moving, keep moving.

26:29.810 --> 26:31.814
‐ Young man.
‐ Yeah, yeah.

26:31.814 --> 26:33.483
Now, how are we
cooking the salmon?
Where are we going?

26:33.483 --> 26:35.689
What I want to do
is something that is
a little bit different.

26:35.689 --> 26:36.724
It's gonna be a fusion dish
to it there,

26:36.724 --> 26:37.826
and that way I can get
everything done

26:37.826 --> 26:39.362
within the time frame
that I've got.

26:39.362 --> 26:40.865
But how you cooking
the salmon?

26:40.865 --> 26:43.170
Skin side down? Boiling it?
Poaching it? Flaking it?

26:43.170 --> 26:44.740
Again, I'm all about fusion,

26:44.740 --> 26:46.242
‐ and right now‐‐
‐ That's not what I'm asking.

26:46.242 --> 26:48.881
I'm asking‐‐
help me to understand
where is this going.

26:48.881 --> 26:50.384
This is awesome.

26:50.384 --> 26:51.554
I'm, like, flustered,
right here right now.

26:51.554 --> 26:53.558
Don't be flummoxed
about the time, okay?

26:53.558 --> 26:55.595
‐ Okay, okay.
‐ It takes eight to ten
minutes to cook.

26:55.595 --> 26:57.098
Just cook the salmon
skin side down,

26:57.098 --> 26:58.868
and do an amazing garnish.

26:58.868 --> 27:00.037
That's a possibility, too,

27:00.037 --> 27:02.241
but for right now,
I kinda want to play around.

27:02.241 --> 27:04.345
‐ That's not a good idea.
‐ Give us your best shot.

27:04.345 --> 27:05.849
‐ You got it.
‐ Okay? Ten minutes to go.

27:05.849 --> 27:07.151
Thank you very much, Chef.

27:07.151 --> 27:09.757
‐ Aarón: Home stretch, everyone!
‐ Cate: Hurry up, people.

27:09.757 --> 27:10.992
Go, go, go.

27:16.002 --> 27:19.208
Guys, I mean,
the real question is
can Jeff survive this?

27:19.208 --> 27:21.847
He hasn't even cooked
his salmon.

27:21.847 --> 27:23.551
Does he not know what
he's cooking at this point?

27:23.551 --> 27:25.020
I, uh, I don't know.

27:25.020 --> 27:27.526
He is going
all over the place.

27:30.364 --> 27:33.905
Jeff has just
put his salmon in.

27:33.905 --> 27:36.577
This is intense.
90 seconds to go.

27:36.577 --> 27:38.948
Cook, baby, cook.

27:38.948 --> 27:40.652
Move, people!

27:42.121 --> 27:43.624
Gordon:
Remember what's at stake.

27:43.624 --> 27:45.093
Christina:
Let's go, Jeff.

27:45.093 --> 27:46.329
Aarón:
Come on, Yachecia!

27:46.329 --> 27:47.398
Oh, shoot!

27:49.068 --> 27:50.805
Taste everything.

27:50.805 --> 27:53.476
‐ Gordon: Ten...
‐ Judges: Nine,

27:53.476 --> 27:56.149
eight, seven, six,

27:56.149 --> 27:59.656
five, four, three,

27:59.656 --> 28:02.394
‐ two, one.
‐ And stop!

28:02.394 --> 28:03.564
‐ Christina: Hands in the air.
‐ Whoo!

28:03.564 --> 28:04.733
It's done. I'm done.

28:04.733 --> 28:06.436
Gordon: Well done.

28:06.436 --> 28:10.812
First up,
the lucky home cook
that had 60 minutes.

28:10.812 --> 28:12.916
Jason, please bring
that dish forward.

28:12.916 --> 28:15.588
‐ ( applause )
‐ Jason.

28:15.588 --> 28:17.826
60 minutes is
a lot of time to cook,

28:17.826 --> 28:20.965
<i>but it means less time</i>
<i>to conceptualize my dish.</i>

28:20.965 --> 28:23.069
Sometimes I get a little lost
with too many ideas,

28:23.069 --> 28:25.842
<i>so hopefully all those flavors</i>
<i>work in harmony</i>

28:25.842 --> 28:28.581
to have the maximum impact
on my salmon dish today.

28:28.581 --> 28:30.484
All right, Jason,
tell me what it is.

28:30.484 --> 28:33.758
So I have for you
a Vietnamese‐inspired salmon.

28:33.758 --> 28:36.129
The marinade is turmeric,
ginger, garlic,

28:36.129 --> 28:38.500
fish sauce, and dill,

28:38.500 --> 28:41.974
and then I added
some slaw of daikon
and heirloom carrots

28:41.974 --> 28:44.178
with crab meat
and Meyer lemon.

28:44.178 --> 28:46.817
Now, the salmon is yellow
because you've put it in
a little bit of turmeric.

28:46.817 --> 28:48.286
‐ Turmeric.
‐ But on the inside,

28:48.286 --> 28:49.690
what temperature
were you hoping for?

28:49.690 --> 28:52.027
I'm hoping
it's medium to rare.

28:52.027 --> 28:55.167
‐ That really luscious pink.
‐ Absolutely, yeah.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.739
All right. Here we go.

29:02.983 --> 29:04.753
Jason...

29:04.753 --> 29:06.022
um...

29:13.336 --> 29:15.608
Jason, what temperature
were you hoping for?

29:15.608 --> 29:17.879
I'm hoping
it's medium to rare.

29:17.879 --> 29:19.683
All right, let's see
what you've got.

29:24.726 --> 29:27.899
This salmon is cooked
pretty beautifully.

29:29.703 --> 29:31.707
And why this crab salad
on top?

29:31.707 --> 29:33.978
I thought the crunch,
the acid,

29:33.978 --> 29:36.717
would be a nice
foil to the salmon,
a little bit richer.

29:36.717 --> 29:39.856
It's a make‐your‐own
kind of explosion
of happy in your mouth.

29:41.159 --> 29:44.699
Every single bit
of knife work
on this dish

29:44.699 --> 29:46.603
‐ is perfect.
‐ Thank you.

29:46.603 --> 29:49.375
Jason, I was worried
that given 60 minutes,

29:49.375 --> 29:51.379
you would overthink it,
you'd overcomplicate it,

29:51.379 --> 29:53.884
but it's a beautiful dish.
Very nice job.

29:53.884 --> 29:54.953
Thank you, Chef.
Thank you.

29:54.953 --> 29:56.122
Nice job, Jason!

29:57.424 --> 29:59.763
Good job, Jason.

29:59.763 --> 30:00.965
Next up, please step
forward, Eboni.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.367
( applause )

30:02.367 --> 30:03.470
Eboni:
<i>Cate gave me 50 minutes.</i>

30:03.470 --> 30:04.773
Although it sound like
a great thing,

30:04.773 --> 30:06.109
for me, it's not.

30:06.109 --> 30:08.446
<i>With that much time,</i>
<i>it has to be perfect.</i>

30:08.446 --> 30:11.954
<i>If it is not perfect,</i>
<i>I have a problem.</i>

30:11.954 --> 30:13.256
‐ How are you, Eboni?
‐ I'm all right.

30:13.256 --> 30:14.726
Please describe your dish.

30:14.726 --> 30:17.966
I have a citrus
crispy skin salmon,

30:17.966 --> 30:21.472
with bamboo rice,
sautéed spinach,

30:21.472 --> 30:25.147
avocado remoulade,
and smoked pecans
and almonds.

30:28.988 --> 30:30.858
The seasoning looks great.

30:30.858 --> 30:32.494
The cook on it is spot on.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.603
Oh, man.

30:36.603 --> 30:38.841
You know,
that forbidden rice
is hard to cook,

30:38.841 --> 30:40.678
'cause it's not
a long‐grain rice,

30:40.678 --> 30:41.947
it's not
a short‐grain rice.

30:41.947 --> 30:43.216
It kind of lives
somewhere in the middle,

30:43.216 --> 30:44.351
and you cooked it perfect.

30:44.351 --> 30:46.322
Avocado, gimme more.

30:46.322 --> 30:47.692
The cook on
the salmon's great.

30:47.692 --> 30:49.495
The seasoning
on the salmon's great.

30:49.495 --> 30:51.499
All the elements
that you presented forward

30:51.499 --> 30:53.504
are all done flawlessly.

30:53.504 --> 30:55.207
Thank you, Chef.

30:55.207 --> 30:56.342
( applause )

30:56.342 --> 30:57.912
Good job, Eboni.

31:00.350 --> 31:02.154
Next up, Yachecia.

31:02.154 --> 31:03.456
( applause )

31:03.456 --> 31:04.693
Yachecia:
<i>I've dreamt up this dish,</i>

31:04.693 --> 31:07.130
<i>and it came out exactly</i>
<i>the way I wanted it,</i>

31:07.130 --> 31:09.301
so I'm hoping
that the dream sequence

31:09.301 --> 31:11.472
continues to work out
on my behalf.

31:13.309 --> 31:14.478
Describe the dish,
please.

31:14.478 --> 31:17.351
It is a sweet and hot salmon

31:17.351 --> 31:19.789
with ancho chiles
and chipotle,

31:19.789 --> 31:21.727
with a braised Swiss chard,

31:21.727 --> 31:25.000
Tuscan white beans
and a citrus cream sauce.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.239
Yachecia, 40 minutes
to nail this tonight,

31:28.239 --> 31:31.913
twice the amount of time
that Jeff had...

31:31.913 --> 31:33.483
and it looks disgusting.

31:37.357 --> 31:39.261
I expect someone to cook
like that with ten minutes.

31:41.165 --> 31:42.602
Uh, I'm sorry,
I really thought

31:42.602 --> 31:44.004
I was there
with this one, but‐‐

31:44.004 --> 31:45.440
The salmon's hammered.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.044
It's not even dry,
it's not even pink,
it's hammered.

31:48.547 --> 31:51.520
I've served better fish
to my ( bleep ) cat.

31:58.399 --> 32:00.771
It's horrible.
I'm sorry.

32:00.771 --> 32:03.409
How I can taste
sour grapefruit

32:03.409 --> 32:06.550
with Tuscan beans
with rainbow chard
in a cream sauce

32:06.550 --> 32:10.190
and then sweet and sour
blackened salmon,
I swear to God.

32:10.190 --> 32:11.593
What upsets me,
your flavor profile's unique,

32:11.593 --> 32:14.365
you cook like
a dream sometimes,

32:14.365 --> 32:16.937
but you've just absolutely
screwed that dish 100%.

32:16.937 --> 32:18.941
And you need to hope right now

32:18.941 --> 32:20.611
that someone behind you
has a worse dish,

32:20.611 --> 32:23.784
because that is
the worst dish I've seen

32:23.784 --> 32:27.558
at this stage
in the competition
in history.

32:29.963 --> 32:31.867
Thank you.

32:31.867 --> 32:33.637
Cate:
Nice try, Yachecia.

32:33.637 --> 32:36.910
This dish was so awesome
in my head,

32:36.910 --> 32:41.085
and now it looks
like the dream that I had
about this salmon dish

32:41.085 --> 32:44.458
it turning into
a crazy nightmare.

32:44.458 --> 32:45.995
Next up, please, Dino.

32:45.995 --> 32:48.166
‐ ( applause )
‐ Cate: Come on, Dino!

32:48.166 --> 32:50.136
Dino:
<i>Cate gave me a half an hour,</i>

32:50.136 --> 32:52.642
but I wanted to make it look
like a 60‐minute dish,

32:52.642 --> 32:54.077
<i>and I hope it shows.</i>

32:54.077 --> 32:56.315
Dino, what'd you make?

32:56.315 --> 33:00.156
So I made a zucchini
Italian squash‐wrapped salmon,

33:00.156 --> 33:03.764
on a bed of fregola
with a lemon cream sauce,

33:03.764 --> 33:07.605
and the top garnish
is a pepper stuffed
with crab meat.

33:07.605 --> 33:10.443
Now, cook on this salmon
is gonna be important.

33:10.443 --> 33:11.980
What temperature
were you going for?

33:11.980 --> 33:14.117
Medium rare.
Hope it's not overcooked.

33:14.117 --> 33:16.388
Let's see how you did.

33:19.294 --> 33:20.965
You did a nice job.

33:20.965 --> 33:23.971
Now let's see
how it tastes.

33:27.945 --> 33:28.947
Hmm.

33:30.316 --> 33:32.354
Your salmon has a ton
of great flavor to it,

33:32.354 --> 33:35.961
and these fregola,
very smart pairing
with that salmon.

33:35.961 --> 33:38.266
‐ They add great texture.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

33:38.266 --> 33:39.702
It's such a smart,
elegant dish,

33:39.702 --> 33:41.973
and to see you do it
in 30 minutes

33:41.973 --> 33:43.610
is incredibly impressive.

33:43.610 --> 33:44.812
‐ Thank you.
‐ Nice job.

33:44.812 --> 33:47.350
‐ Thank you so much.
‐ Cate: Nice work, Dino!

33:52.895 --> 33:56.903
Next up, the man
with the least
amount of time tonight.

33:56.903 --> 33:58.239
Jeff, let's go.

33:58.239 --> 34:00.243
( applause )

34:00.243 --> 34:02.848
Jeff:
<i>Cate gave me only</i>
<i>20 minutes to work with,</i>

34:02.848 --> 34:04.752
so time was certainly
not on my side.

34:04.752 --> 34:07.858
<i>But I did the best I could</i>
<i>with the time that I was given,</i>

34:07.858 --> 34:12.100
<i>and at the end of the day,</i>
<i>I don't think anyone else</i>
<i>could've done better.</i>

34:12.100 --> 34:14.872
‐ Describe the dish
for me, Jeff.
‐ My pleasure.

34:14.872 --> 34:16.543
So what we have here
is a salmon filet

34:16.543 --> 34:18.379
with a Mediterranean
vibe to it there,

34:18.379 --> 34:21.620
with a little bit
of feta cheese and
sundried tomato relish.

34:21.620 --> 34:25.628
That's over a nice apple
and pear and cucumber gratin,

34:25.628 --> 34:28.834
with cranberry
and stout beer.

34:28.834 --> 34:31.740
‐ Let's get in there,
shall we?
‐ Certainly.

34:32.975 --> 34:34.478
The cook on the salmon
is what?

34:34.478 --> 34:36.650
Medium rare,
but going more
towards a rare.

34:45.066 --> 34:47.270
‐ Jeff.
‐ That's exactly
what I want.

34:50.009 --> 34:51.613
It's raw.

34:51.613 --> 34:53.349
Are you trying
to poison me?

35:01.566 --> 35:03.169
The cook on the salmon
is what?

35:03.169 --> 35:05.306
Medium rare,
but going more
towards a rare.

35:13.590 --> 35:14.759
Jeff.

35:14.759 --> 35:16.261
That's exactly what I want.

35:16.261 --> 35:19.434
Jeff, come on.
Are you trying
to poison me?

35:19.434 --> 35:21.940
No.

35:21.940 --> 35:23.777
Pear, cucumber,
and apple, did you say?

35:23.777 --> 35:25.914
That was cooked down
and reduced within
the stout beer,

35:25.914 --> 35:28.620
so that way then it kind of
had that nice little bit
of a sauce to it there.

35:31.726 --> 35:34.732
It's weird.
It's like sushi, there.

35:34.732 --> 35:36.936
The fibers haven't
even gone. Look.

35:36.936 --> 35:38.472
But that's
what I was going for.

35:38.472 --> 35:41.111
I wanted it to be
on the rarer side.

35:41.111 --> 35:42.715
Gordon:
Oh, come on, young man.

35:42.715 --> 35:45.153
‐ Are you saying
you wanted it that rare?
‐ Yes.

35:45.153 --> 35:47.290
Yes.

35:47.290 --> 35:49.294
With rubber skin,
topped with feta cheese?

35:49.294 --> 35:51.666
You know, I did go
for a nice crispy skin.

35:51.666 --> 35:55.306
Stout and cranberries
and gratin and cucumber

35:55.306 --> 35:58.345
and raw salmon
with feta cheese
don't go, period.

35:58.345 --> 36:00.149
‐ Thank you.
‐ I felt for you.

36:00.149 --> 36:01.285
You've been given 20 minutes.

36:01.285 --> 36:03.455
But you're not
gonna lecture me

36:03.455 --> 36:04.959
that that's how you wanted
to cook the salmon,

36:04.959 --> 36:06.295
'cause the salmon's raw, Jeff.

36:06.295 --> 36:07.898
Thank you.

36:10.704 --> 36:13.275
( applause )

36:14.745 --> 36:17.283
Finally, direct hit.
Bull's‐eye, Cate.

36:17.283 --> 36:20.489
<i>Jeff did everything</i>
<i>that I hoped he would.</i>

36:20.489 --> 36:22.327
<i>He created an awful dish,</i>

36:22.327 --> 36:24.599
and then tried to BS
his way through it.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.936
Cate, please,
come down here.

36:26.936 --> 36:29.140
<i>Looks like he's finally</i>
<i>headed back to Tampa</i>

36:29.140 --> 36:30.276
<i>where he belongs.</i>

36:31.946 --> 36:34.117
Aarón:
Guys, we're gonna
be saying goodbye

36:34.117 --> 36:36.956
to at least one of you
this evening.

36:36.956 --> 36:38.927
We need a moment
to discuss, please.

36:47.377 --> 36:49.180
Hey, were we allowed
to make sushi?

36:50.316 --> 36:51.786
‐ No.
‐ It couldn't be raw.

36:51.786 --> 36:52.988
Then why'd he serve it raw?

36:55.627 --> 36:58.299
( laughs )

36:58.299 --> 37:00.202
Go make a spaghetti
and meatball.

37:00.202 --> 37:01.806
Go make a what?

37:01.806 --> 37:03.342
Go make another
spaghetti and meatball.

37:03.342 --> 37:06.683
I'll be making
a spaghetti and meatball
for your lady tonight.

37:06.683 --> 37:08.285
Go ( bleep ) yourself.

37:08.285 --> 37:10.590
Heh heh.

37:10.590 --> 37:12.427
Guys, guys, really, stop.

37:12.427 --> 37:14.197
Should they make
the $250,000

37:14.197 --> 37:17.638
out to your therapist
or to you?

37:17.638 --> 37:20.877
‐ Hey, I'm already insured.
‐ Okay, I just want to
make sure that's covered.

37:20.877 --> 37:23.115
‐ My therapist is
already paid for.
‐ Okay.

37:24.284 --> 37:25.787
Dino, stop.

37:25.787 --> 37:27.123
You make jokes about me, too.

37:27.123 --> 37:28.960
But that's
because I love you.

37:28.960 --> 37:31.799
‐ I love him.
‐ ( Eboni laughs )

37:31.799 --> 37:34.404
Dino:
I love him the most.

37:34.404 --> 37:35.907
Oh, y'all so full
of ( bleep ).

37:35.907 --> 37:37.076
I don't like
none of y'all.

37:50.570 --> 37:52.608
If I say your name,
please come down to the front.

37:56.281 --> 37:58.686
Yachecia...

37:58.686 --> 38:00.524
and Jeff.

38:07.170 --> 38:09.842
Yachecia, sadly tonight,
young lady,

38:09.842 --> 38:10.877
you were out of your depth.

38:12.681 --> 38:16.722
And Jeff, tonight
you cooked like
you didn't care.

38:18.893 --> 38:21.566
The person leaving
the kitchen tonight...

38:25.172 --> 38:26.341
is...

38:29.582 --> 38:30.717
Yachecia.

38:30.717 --> 38:32.019
( gasps )

38:38.733 --> 38:40.069
And Jeff.

38:42.641 --> 38:45.714
‐ We're both going.
‐ Gordon: Yachecia,

38:45.714 --> 38:48.318
the salmon was miles away
from what we expected.

38:49.320 --> 38:51.158
And Jeff,
you get so defensive,

38:51.158 --> 38:52.961
it's just hard to
get through to you.

38:52.961 --> 38:55.166
We felt that we just can't
teach you anymore

38:55.166 --> 38:56.301
because you're not
prepared to listen.

38:57.938 --> 39:00.977
Yachecia and Jeff,
this journey's been
extraordinary for you.

39:00.977 --> 39:03.382
I think you found out
a lot about yourselves,

39:03.382 --> 39:06.221
and I really hope
that you continue cooking.

39:06.221 --> 39:07.758
Follow that dream.

39:07.758 --> 39:08.927
How you feeling?

39:08.927 --> 39:11.231
Um, I'm‐‐ I'm okay.

39:11.231 --> 39:14.237
To have gotten this far,
I'm really okay.

39:14.237 --> 39:16.041
I think my children
are proud of me,

39:16.041 --> 39:19.247
and I appreciate everything
you all have done.

39:19.247 --> 39:20.817
Jeff, how you feeling?

39:20.817 --> 39:22.588
I'm humbled and appreciative
of the opportunity

39:22.588 --> 39:24.424
to have been in the kitchen,

39:24.424 --> 39:27.129
to have been with so many
incredible competitors
along the way.

39:27.129 --> 39:29.234
I'd also like to take
the opportunity to thank
the three of you,

39:29.234 --> 39:32.774
‐ so thank you.
‐ You two, come up here
and say goodbye, come on.

39:34.444 --> 39:36.616
‐ Thank you so much, Chef.
‐ Thank you, my darling.

39:37.784 --> 39:39.254
‐ Good job, all right?
‐ Thank you very much.

39:39.254 --> 39:41.024
‐ Aarón: You have a good one.
‐ Christina: You're an amazing‐‐

39:41.024 --> 39:42.828
Thank you,
I appreciate it.
I appreciate it.

39:42.828 --> 39:44.497
Thank you very much
for everything.

39:44.497 --> 39:45.767
‐ Thank you.
‐ Congrats on Holden.

39:45.767 --> 39:47.604
‐ Thank you very much.
‐ So handsome.

39:47.604 --> 39:49.340
Please, both of you,
put your aprons on your bench.

39:49.340 --> 39:50.877
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

39:50.877 --> 39:52.380
‐ Best of luck to you guys.
‐ Thank you.

39:52.380 --> 39:54.852
( applause )

39:54.852 --> 39:56.522
I'm bummed
about being eliminated,

39:56.522 --> 39:59.561
<i>but it's kind</i>
<i>of mixed emotions, though,</i>

39:59.561 --> 40:03.468
because I'm so proud of myself
for going this far.

40:03.468 --> 40:06.542
This apron belongs
to Yachecia.

40:06.542 --> 40:08.813
‐ Yes! Hallelujah!
‐ Congratulations.

40:08.813 --> 40:11.051
Wow. Holy ( bleep ).

40:11.051 --> 40:13.388
‐ I know you can't
say that in church.
‐ No, Chef.

40:13.388 --> 40:15.894
But we're not
in ( bleep ) church.

40:15.894 --> 40:17.831
Gordon: This apron
belongs to... Jeff.

40:17.831 --> 40:20.402
What up, people?
Come on!

40:20.402 --> 40:22.106
I'm leaving
the MasterChef kitchen,

40:22.106 --> 40:25.179
<i>but this journey</i>
<i>brought out Jeff 2.0.</i>

40:25.179 --> 40:26.682
You have very
good taste, Jeff.

40:26.682 --> 40:28.118
Oh, thank you.

40:28.118 --> 40:30.790
<i>My cooking has been</i>
<i>elevated to a new level.</i>

40:30.790 --> 40:32.961
This Florida home cook has
already established himself

40:32.961 --> 40:35.633
as a force in this kitchen.
Jeff, come down please.

40:35.633 --> 40:38.205
It's delicious.
There's no stopping you
right now, is there?

40:38.205 --> 40:39.975
Not at all.

40:39.975 --> 40:43.315
‐ Yachecia, I mean,
that is textbook.
‐ Thank you, Chef,

40:43.315 --> 40:45.987
There's no way in the world
that I could feel disappointed,

40:45.987 --> 40:49.427
<i>because I've grown so much</i>
<i>in this competition.</i>

40:49.427 --> 40:51.264
You've turned
into this beast.

40:51.264 --> 40:54.671
‐ Jeff, I need you,
right on that hollandaise.
‐ Heard, I got you.

40:54.671 --> 40:56.174
I wear my emotions
on my sleeve.

40:56.174 --> 40:57.744
I'm a very passionate person,

40:57.744 --> 40:59.782
and so I might have
ruffled some feathers.

40:59.782 --> 41:01.017
<i>Honestly, I probably have.</i>

41:01.017 --> 41:01.986
Get out of my way, please!

41:01.986 --> 41:03.756
<i>But I always worked hard...</i>

41:03.756 --> 41:05.894
‐ Nice color on there,
Jeff, good.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

41:05.894 --> 41:07.964
<i>‐ I supported my team.</i>
‐ ( grunts )

41:07.964 --> 41:09.300
I think I did the best
that I could.

41:09.300 --> 41:12.273
‐ Gordon: Well done.
‐ ( Jeff chuckles )

41:21.124 --> 41:22.727
Announcer:
<i>Next week...</i>

41:22.727 --> 41:25.567
<i>the finale is just</i>

41:25.567 --> 41:27.136
<i>three pressure tests away.</i>

41:28.472 --> 41:30.142
<i>And with the end</i>
<i>in sight...</i>

41:31.411 --> 41:32.848
Gordon:
This is it.

41:32.848 --> 41:35.987
We are raising
the stakes tonight.

41:35.987 --> 41:37.323
<i>whose MasterChef dream...</i>

41:37.323 --> 41:39.494
‐ Needs to go in the oven!
‐ <i>will rise...</i>

41:39.494 --> 41:41.331
‐ ( bleep )
‐ Come on, move!

41:41.331 --> 41:42.500
‐ <i>and fall...</i>
‐ ( bleep )

41:42.500 --> 41:44.203
This is it.
( sniffles )

41:44.203 --> 41:45.540
‐ You okay?
‐ I did a bad job.

41:45.540 --> 41:47.644
It's do or die.

41:47.644 --> 41:50.550
‐ It looks awful.
‐ To be eliminated now
would be crushing.

41:50.550 --> 41:52.486
( crying )
