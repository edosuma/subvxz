If it were my restaurant,

00:07.133 --> 00:09.000
a lot of things
would have been sent back.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.367

with what I saw in the galley.

I'm out of here.

a new deckhand, so...

I can win an argument
with you quite quickly.

00:36.767 --> 00:38.300
We should get married.

we're holding hands.

It's so official.

I like him.
I like him a lot.

00:42.300 --> 00:43.300
I'm excited to spend time
with him.

00:49.066 --> 00:50.600
- You seem miserable.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.734
- No, you seem
very out of line right now.

00:52.734 --> 00:55.033
- This is a friend of a friend.
- You're not my friend.

00:55.033 --> 00:57.200

to my boiling point.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.000
It is what it is.

that our conversation

her

a new stewardess

on their ass.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.767
He won't have to come to me
to do it.

Do we need to come forward?

25:54.567 --> 25:56.066
- Yeah, you're good.

25:56.066 --> 25:57.533
- Lock that spring line.

25:57.533 --> 25:59.700
Lock the spring line.

25:59.700 --> 26:01.200
- I'm all good
on the stern, Captain.

26:01.200 --> 26:02.600
- Hey, Bruno, tighten that.

26:02.600 --> 26:04.266
Tighten that.
This one.

26:04.266 --> 26:06.700
Lock it down.
- Well done, everybody.

26:06.700 --> 26:09.600
Outstanding.
- Nice driving, Cap.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.700
This whole season has been
a big learning experience

26:11.700 --> 26:13.700
not just for the deck crew
but also for me.

26:13.700 --> 26:15.400
Even though
I may not be boatswain,

26:15.400 --> 26:17.333
I do take my job seriously.

26:17.333 --> 26:19.300
- We're all good.
Thank you, guys.

26:19.300 --> 26:21.633
- Slow, slow, slow, slow,
slow, slow.

26:21.633 --> 26:23.100
It's a big angle.

26:23.100 --> 26:24.467
- All crew, all crew,

26:24.467 --> 26:25.600
I need everybody
on the aft deck

26:25.600 --> 26:27.200
ASAP.

26:27.200 --> 26:28.600
- Let's hurry up.
They're getting off.

this season, Kelley.

26:32.633 --> 26:35.300

26:43.233 --> 26:44.700
- Oh, here they come.
Here they come.

26:46.767 --> 26:48.467
- Bye.
- Thank you...

26:48.467 --> 26:49.600
- Thank you for everything.
- So much.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.200
- I hope you enjoyed it.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.233
- We had a wonderful time.

26:53.233 --> 26:56.100
- Thank you.
Enjoy your trip home.

26:56.100 --> 26:59.100
- Thank you so much.
- Aw!

26:59.100 --> 27:01.467
- Shelly.
- Thank you.

27:01.467 --> 27:03.233
Y'all were so lovely.

27:03.233 --> 27:05.100

Captain Lee,

27:05.100 --> 27:07.633
your guys are just amazing.

27:07.633 --> 27:09.133
Five star, five star.

27:09.133 --> 27:10.633
I can't say it
even any more than that.

27:10.633 --> 27:12.266
It was perfect.

27:12.266 --> 27:14.233
The food, Matt--
I mean, you're so talented.

27:14.233 --> 27:15.533
- Thank you.

27:15.533 --> 27:17.133
- Your salad dressing's
off the chart.

27:17.133 --> 27:19.000
- Thank you.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.266
I knew the guests
would love my cooking.

27:20.266 --> 27:21.333
Captain was dead wrong
about me.

27:21.333 --> 27:22.767
In your face!

27:22.767 --> 27:24.400
- This is yours.
Thank you so much.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.133
You guys were just amazing.

27:26.133 --> 27:27.667
Bon voyage.
- Bye.

27:27.667 --> 27:30.100
all: Bye!
- Take care.

about the tip?

27:40.133 --> 27:41.400

27:41.400 --> 27:43.400
- I think I'm excited.

27:43.400 --> 27:46.300
I think maybe we would have got
$2,000 each, hopefully.

All in all, I think
it was a good charter.

Your girls did a good job
on service.

28:04.700 --> 28:07.000
The toy situation

You guys did a good job
with that.

That being said,
let's get right to the tip.

28:14.266 --> 28:16.266
15,000.

28:17.400 --> 28:20.300
Yeah, Bruno, that's exactly
the look I got.

28:20.300 --> 28:23.300
It's like we're just
f---ing stuck on 15,000.

I'm not impressed.

28:25.300 --> 28:26.734
That's mediocre.

If you have one mediocre player
on a team,

28:30.567 --> 28:33.066
you have a mediocre team.

28:33.066 --> 28:36.033
I've been wanting to see
that $2,500 tip,

28:36.033 --> 28:37.600
and it's not happening.

28:37.600 --> 28:40.066
We've got one charter left,

28:40.066 --> 28:42.433
so what I want out of you guys

28:42.433 --> 28:46.033
is to collectively
sit down here,

28:46.033 --> 28:49.033
hash this sh-- out
in a constructive way,

28:49.033 --> 28:51.300
and figure out
what we're doing wrong.

28:51.300 --> 28:54.734
The important thing is that
we nail this next charter.

28:54.734 --> 28:56.567
I'm almost at my wits' end
here,

28:56.567 --> 28:57.734
because it seems like

28:57.734 --> 29:00.066
we get one situation solved,

29:00.066 --> 29:01.533
like with the deck crew.

29:01.533 --> 29:03.567
Now they're functioning
as a team.

29:03.567 --> 29:05.467
But then I've got the chef
that's just playing it safe.

29:05.467 --> 29:08.333
And so now I'm hoping
we can finish strong,

29:08.333 --> 29:10.633
but that's all it is;
it's a distant hope.

29:10.633 --> 29:12.767
Okay?

29:12.767 --> 29:15.333
- Lash it out
in the crew mess.

29:15.333 --> 29:16.700

29:16.700 --> 29:19.500
with Captain Lee's
observations.

29:19.500 --> 29:21.367
People think he doesn't know
what goes on

29:21.367 --> 29:24.100
below the wheelhouse,
but he does,

29:24.100 --> 29:27.200
and his tip meeting speech
proves it.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.767
I think the deck crew
is stepping up.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.600
There haven't been
any major complaints

29:30.600 --> 29:32.233
with the interior.

29:32.233 --> 29:34.100
I think it's mostly aimed
at Matt.

The galley is suffering.

to see differently

29:38.633 --> 29:40.333
from the interior?

- When you're on charter,
sh-- should be getting done.

29:45.467 --> 29:47.166
Captain was talking about

29:47.166 --> 29:48.767
how we're gonna make
more f---ing money.

29:57.667 --> 29:59.133

all these opinions,

29:59.133 --> 30:01.100
especially about the interior.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.000
And he can't be
this uncomfortably

30:03.000 --> 30:04.633
too close of a friend

30:04.633 --> 30:06.633
but then also come in
with opinions

30:06.633 --> 30:08.000
about how I'm running the boat.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.600
- That sh-- needs to change.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.133

calling someone a whore?

cooking breakfast.

30:28.633 --> 30:30.233
- You know, I trust Kyle,

30:30.233 --> 30:33.300
but instead he decides
to run his mouth

30:33.300 --> 30:35.300
to the person
that I least want him

30:35.300 --> 30:37.033
to run his mouth to.

30:37.033 --> 30:39.233
- I will take over
the early service this charter,

30:39.233 --> 30:41.300
because I've done
many breakfast services.

And what else?

- Matt, I think you did
a great job this charter.

30:47.233 --> 30:49.667
- Maybe take as much risk
as possible.

30:49.667 --> 30:51.300
- Risk.
- Go extreme.

are gonna want something crazy.

30:56.266 --> 30:58.133
I have something up my sleeve.

30:58.133 --> 30:59.700
- To really end this charter
season on a high note,

30:59.700 --> 31:01.700
it's important
that Matt delivers

31:01.700 --> 31:03.700
his best charter food ever.

31:03.700 --> 31:05.433
We have guests arriving
in 21 hours.

- Hey, Ma, how's it going?

31:15.600 --> 31:17.734
You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

31:17.734 --> 31:19.700
- You don't sound all right.
- I've been struggling a lot.

31:19.700 --> 31:22.533
- Everybody's struggling, Ma.
It's not easy.

31:22.533 --> 31:24.166
- I know that.

31:24.166 --> 31:26.333
- Nothing.
Working, working, working.

31:26.333 --> 31:29.467
My family situation right now
is on rocky terms.

Dealing with losing
your best friend

31:31.300 --> 31:32.734

31:32.734 --> 31:35.066
it's kind of just changed
my perspective

31:35.066 --> 31:37.066
that all the bullsh--
doesn't matter.

31:37.066 --> 31:38.600
Family, that's all
that matters.

All right, well, I got
to get back to work.

F---, f---.

Kyle was talking about

31:54.533 --> 31:56.367
when it comes to the breakfast?

31:56.367 --> 31:59.200
- There was dirty silverware
still in the dishwasher.

31:59.200 --> 32:01.066
I had to rerun it.

32:01.066 --> 32:03.367
I had to hand-wash it
even after the second time.

32:03.367 --> 32:05.100
- As soon as I asked Jen
about breakfast,

32:05.100 --> 32:07.200
I know that she slept in
and is lying to me,

32:07.200 --> 32:09.600
because she gets defensive.

32:09.600 --> 32:12.066
- Why am I ironing
Chris's shirt?

32:25.767 --> 32:28.033
- [sighs]

32:28.033 --> 32:30.033

I need you guys

32:32.066 --> 32:33.500

- Copy.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.100

32:35.100 --> 32:36.600
Charter nine.

32:39.100 --> 32:40.133
- Howdy, howdy.

32:40.133 --> 32:41.400
- Hey.
- Hi.

32:41.400 --> 32:44.633
- So how did
your little powwow go?

32:44.633 --> 32:46.467
- I think it was productive.

32:46.467 --> 32:48.000
- Yeah?
-Yeah.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.266
- Last charter.
I guess we'll find out.

32:49.266 --> 32:50.500
- Mm-hmm.

32:50.500 --> 32:52.500
- Six people, I think.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.533
- Timothy.

32:54.533 --> 32:56.500
- We had him on "Ohana."

32:56.500 --> 32:58.100
He's a character.

32:58.100 --> 32:59.467
- I planned to give you guys
22 grand,

32:59.467 --> 33:00.500
but there were
some things wrong,

33:00.500 --> 33:02.500
so we'll rip it.

33:02.500 --> 33:04.133
- Okay.
- So 17.

33:04.133 --> 33:05.533
- He's a financial person.

33:05.533 --> 33:07.400
He's like,
"That's gonna cost ya."

33:07.400 --> 33:09.100
- So stoked.

33:09.100 --> 33:10.400
- This guy sounds like
a douchebag.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.000
- He's a repeat charter client

33:12.000 --> 33:13.667
celebrating
ten-year anniversary

33:13.667 --> 33:15.633
of his teaching company.

33:15.633 --> 33:18.500
Timothy is bringing
his top three employees

33:18.500 --> 33:20.700
as a thank-you
for their dedication.

33:20.700 --> 33:23.033
- That's nice.
- He wants to go all out.

33:23.033 --> 33:24.700
The more extravagant,
the better.

33:24.700 --> 33:26.300
- Oh, got to bring it.

33:26.300 --> 33:28.567
- We're gonna do
some fireworks on a beach.

33:28.567 --> 33:31.400
And got a chef's choice
tasting meal.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.400
- I see that.
- Any questions?

33:33.400 --> 33:35.400
- Can we please him?
Is he happy?

33:35.400 --> 33:36.700
Was he complaining
all the time?

33:36.700 --> 33:38.300
- He is particular,

33:38.300 --> 33:40.133
but he will let you know
what he wants.

33:40.133 --> 33:41.400
- Did you get my list
of ingredients?

33:41.400 --> 33:43.433
Did you find sea cucumber
ovaries?

33:43.433 --> 33:44.533
- That's the one thing
I didn't--

33:44.533 --> 33:46.033
- Oh!

33:46.033 --> 33:48.166
- We had this conversation
with him.

33:48.166 --> 33:49.700
He doesn't follow instructions.

33:49.700 --> 33:51.400
Ay ay ay.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.700
- As long as you just deliver
what he asks for,

33:53.700 --> 33:55.433
he is happy.
- Okay.

33:55.433 --> 33:57.266
- Part of me
doesn't really want

33:57.266 --> 34:00.300
to warn Matt about
how demanding Timothy Sykes is

34:00.300 --> 34:02.033
when it comes to food,

34:02.033 --> 34:03.200
'cause I think it'll just
freak him out even more.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.000
And let's face it.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.333
He's probably not gonna nail it
either way.

34:06.333 --> 34:08.066
- We've got, like, 18 hours
to get ready.

34:08.066 --> 34:10.433
So whatever it takes,
you need to get it done.

34:18.567 --> 34:20.066
- I would like to get out
of uniform

34:20.066 --> 34:21.467
and get off the boat.

34:21.467 --> 34:23.200
But I think that if we went
the entire crew,

34:23.200 --> 34:26.066
it would just be chitchat
and a waste of time.

34:26.066 --> 34:27.667
Let's change, just go
to a nearby restaurant,

34:27.667 --> 34:30.000
and we can talk
and make our orders together

34:30.000 --> 34:31.200
and talk about this charter.

34:31.200 --> 34:32.600
- Okay.

34:32.600 --> 34:33.734
- We don't have a choice
at this point.

34:33.734 --> 34:35.467
I've seen what Matt can do.

34:35.467 --> 34:37.433
Timothy Sykes
is coming on board.

34:37.433 --> 34:39.200
I think it's time
that I just take the wheels

34:39.200 --> 34:41.200
and drive this charter home
to Good Food Town.

34:41.200 --> 34:43.600
So it's like a work dinner.

34:48.767 --> 34:50.567
- The night is young.

34:50.567 --> 34:52.433
I'm feeling frisky.

34:52.433 --> 34:54.233
I'm having a great hair day.

34:54.233 --> 34:55.767
I think the girls
will come out to play,

34:55.767 --> 34:58.066
and we'll see what happens.

34:58.066 --> 34:59.500
- Don't wait up.

34:59.500 --> 35:01.100
- All right, guys, let's go.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.367
- I think you're overdressed,
Kyle.

35:02.367 --> 35:04.367
- [laughs]

35:05.734 --> 35:07.567
- This is a great idea.

35:07.567 --> 35:09.767
- I didn't want to not get
prepared for the charter,

35:09.767 --> 35:11.433
but I also really wanted
to leave the boat.

35:11.433 --> 35:13.066
- Right.

35:13.066 --> 35:14.233
- I feel like we're going
to a study group.

35:14.233 --> 35:15.600
We're gonna go
do our homework.

35:15.600 --> 35:16.633
- All right, let's do this.

35:16.633 --> 35:17.633
I like it that I'm on top.

35:17.633 --> 35:19.233
- [laughs]

35:19.233 --> 35:21.500
- Ah, my sunburn!
F--- off, f---ing bitch.

35:21.500 --> 35:23.233
- Okay?
- It works for me.

35:23.233 --> 35:24.500
- Yeah, I like it.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.367
This guy just looks
intimidating.

35:26.367 --> 35:27.467
- He is, and he isn't.

35:27.467 --> 35:29.133
I think he grew up

35:29.133 --> 35:30.734
watching "Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous"

35:30.734 --> 35:33.367
and he wants champagne wishes,
caviar dreams.

35:33.367 --> 35:34.667
- Ugh.
- Cheers.

35:34.667 --> 35:36.233
- Cheers. Thanks, Kate.
- Uh-huh.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
- Here we are. All right.

35:42.233 --> 35:45.333
- Hey, I'm curious
what everyone's getting into

35:45.333 --> 35:46.734
after we're done.

35:46.734 --> 35:48.400
I mean, I know
what we're getting into.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.233
- A bed?
- Huh?

35:50.233 --> 35:52.667
- I'm gonna go back to Portugal
to get my visa.

35:52.667 --> 35:55.633
I want to go to LA, California,
all those places.

35:55.633 --> 35:57.266
- What about everyone else?

35:57.266 --> 35:59.000
Where you going?

35:59.000 --> 36:02.633
- I'm going back to Charleston
for probably--

36:02.633 --> 36:04.400
- Yeah, yup.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.367
- This is the first restaurant
I've seen this thingy.

36:06.367 --> 36:08.133
- It's like the deep fryer.
- Yeah, it's really funny.

36:08.133 --> 36:10.433
It's homemade potatoes,
so it's really good.

36:10.433 --> 36:13.000
- I wonder how Matt and Kate's
dinner is going right now.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.700
- Okay, I'm gonna start
writing stuff down.

36:14.700 --> 36:17.000
- Night one is where
I would obviously do

36:17.000 --> 36:18.166
your tasting menu.

36:18.166 --> 36:20.000
Cheddar foam on beet salad.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.667
I know that he does love sushi.
That's a course.

36:22.667 --> 36:24.700
Seafood, any fresh fish
caught that day.

36:24.700 --> 36:26.166
- I love the wahoo.

36:26.166 --> 36:27.266
both: On the black plate.

36:27.266 --> 36:28.300
- So it can look nice.

36:28.300 --> 36:30.133
We can do a steak tartare.

36:30.133 --> 36:31.700
- Yeah, so it's still raw,
it's still in the theme,

36:31.700 --> 36:33.000
but it's mixing it up.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.500
A ceviche.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.633
A shrimp cocktail
could be really nice.

36:35.633 --> 36:37.400
Miso ginger salmon.

36:39.300 --> 36:41.033
- You all three
got the same thing?

36:41.033 --> 36:42.266
- No, I got the flank steak.

36:42.266 --> 36:43.633
- Is that au jus?
- Huh?

36:43.633 --> 36:46.266
- Au jus?
- I don't know.

36:46.266 --> 36:47.467
- May I?

36:47.467 --> 36:49.266
[music winds down]

36:53.166 --> 36:54.600
- Now, I'm big
on table manners,

36:54.600 --> 36:55.734
and I believe
you get to know someone

36:55.734 --> 36:57.166
quite well over dinner.

36:57.166 --> 36:58.567
And this chick,

36:58.567 --> 37:00.433
with her badly manicured
fingers,

37:00.433 --> 37:02.300
grabs a forks

37:02.300 --> 37:04.533
and then just f---ing dips it
in my gravy.

37:04.533 --> 37:05.700
What the f--- are you doing?

37:05.700 --> 37:07.133
You know I won't eat it.

37:07.133 --> 37:08.734
- I know you won't.

37:08.734 --> 37:10.667
He's such a food--
like, he doesn't like anyone

37:10.667 --> 37:12.467
touching any of his food.

37:12.467 --> 37:14.300
He won't eat it now.
Like, he will not touch it.

37:14.300 --> 37:16.200
- Just because
you're a sh-- stewardess

37:16.200 --> 37:18.066
doesn't mean that I ain't
gonna try and bang you.

37:18.066 --> 37:19.700
But when you make
the conscious decision

37:19.700 --> 37:21.433
to f--- with my food,
you're done.

37:21.433 --> 37:22.600
You're dead to me.

37:22.600 --> 37:24.567
- Wait, what happened?

37:24.567 --> 37:27.333
- Kyle's a huge, like,
food germy

37:27.333 --> 37:28.734
and doesn't like when anyone

37:28.734 --> 37:30.367
touches his plate
sort of thing.

37:30.367 --> 37:32.066
Kyle is not uptight at all,

37:32.066 --> 37:33.367
but when it comes
to his table manners,

37:33.367 --> 37:36.367
he's just strange
about his food.

37:36.367 --> 37:38.066
- That's f----ing enough.

37:38.066 --> 37:39.467
Eat with your mouth closed.

37:39.467 --> 37:40.734
- Oh, my God.

37:40.734 --> 37:42.200
[laughter]

37:42.200 --> 37:44.066
- That's his thing.

37:44.066 --> 37:45.767
- Are you
f---ing kidding me?

37:45.767 --> 37:48.333
- He won't touch that.

37:49.467 --> 37:51.066
- I'm not talking about "we."

37:51.066 --> 37:54.367
This is between me and Baker,
so f--- off.

37:54.367 --> 37:55.600
I don't need this sh-- either!

38:00.000 --> 38:00.367
- Kyle's a huge, like,

38:00.367 --> 38:00.500
- Kyle's a huge, like,
food germy

38:02.367 --> 38:03.633
and doesn't like when anyone

38:03.633 --> 38:05.166
touches his plate
sort of thing.

38:05.166 --> 38:06.600
- Are you f---ing kidding me?

38:06.600 --> 38:07.734
- He won't touch that.

38:07.734 --> 38:09.600
- But it was just a fork.

38:09.600 --> 38:11.000
I didn't, like, lick the fork
and then put it in.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.533
It's just like, "Really?

38:12.533 --> 38:13.767
Of course
I'm the bad guy again.

38:13.767 --> 38:16.233
I mean, I was a fool to think

38:16.233 --> 38:18.266
that I was gonna have
a great night tonight.

38:18.266 --> 38:20.533
- You need to eat.
You're a sh--.

38:20.533 --> 38:22.467
- No, I have one moral
in life,

38:22.467 --> 38:23.667
and that's
f---ing table manners.

38:23.667 --> 38:25.467
- Do all of us a favor.

38:25.467 --> 38:28.500
Please, please, please
don't even bring it--

38:28.500 --> 38:30.367
She will get--
this is gonna be bad.

38:30.367 --> 38:31.533
Just say you're not hungry.

38:31.533 --> 38:33.133
Don't blame it on her.

38:33.133 --> 38:34.600
And we'll all have
a pleasant night.

38:37.633 --> 38:39.400
I'm doing everything in my
power

38:39.400 --> 38:41.667
to just keep the peace
between the two.

38:41.667 --> 38:44.100
You guys come down.
We'll see you at piano bar.

38:44.100 --> 38:46.400
- Okay, guys.
Behave, huh?

38:46.400 --> 38:50.367
- Beet salad, sushi,
shrimp cocktail, salmon.

38:50.367 --> 38:52.233
- So then you have
a dessert,

38:52.233 --> 38:53.767
and then you can pull up

38:53.767 --> 38:56.700
some bullsh-- little
palate cleanser in there.

38:56.700 --> 38:58.667
- Yeah, I love--
oh, yeah.

38:58.667 --> 39:00.667
- I'm telling you, this is
a great meeting of the minds.

39:00.667 --> 39:02.000
I like it.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.700
- Hi.
Did he even eat?

39:03.700 --> 39:05.300
- Uh-uh.

39:05.300 --> 39:07.033
- It doesn't hurt to get
rejected by Kyle,

39:07.033 --> 39:08.667
but it sucks.

39:08.667 --> 39:11.133
It's like the one person
that was my distraction

39:11.133 --> 39:13.400
from these bullies.

39:13.400 --> 39:15.700
Has left me
with very little options.

39:15.700 --> 39:17.300
- Merci beaucoup.

39:17.300 --> 39:18.700
- Well, this was
the most productive evening

39:18.700 --> 39:20.400
we've had all season.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.166
If you just plan it
in advance,

39:22.166 --> 39:24.266
you don't have to think
while it's happening.

39:24.266 --> 39:26.166
- Yeah, wish you could
do this more often.

39:26.166 --> 39:27.667
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

39:27.667 --> 39:29.433
- Hey!

39:29.433 --> 39:31.567
Fancy seeing you here.

39:31.567 --> 39:33.033
- Do you have Jaeger?

39:33.033 --> 39:34.567
- Uh, they don't.

39:34.567 --> 39:36.300
- Time to get loose, huh?

39:36.300 --> 39:37.600
- Six tequilas, please?

39:37.600 --> 39:39.333
- Six tequila?
- Please.

39:39.333 --> 39:41.333
These shots are on me, guys.

39:41.333 --> 39:43.033
- Ha!

39:43.033 --> 39:44.734
- Nico, it's f---ing good
to see you, kid.

39:44.734 --> 39:46.300
Cheers.
- Hold on. Hold on.

39:46.300 --> 39:47.567
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

39:47.567 --> 39:49.066
- You have something to say?

39:49.066 --> 39:52.433
- He is getting my salt.

39:52.433 --> 39:54.200
Whatever.
Just go.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.033
- Long day, son.

39:56.033 --> 39:58.200
- Whoo!
I'm burning like hell.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.433
- Okay, okay, okay.

40:00.433 --> 40:03.033
[barking]

40:03.033 --> 40:04.667
- You want to go back?
- Yeah.

40:04.667 --> 40:06.333
- Let's go.

40:06.333 --> 40:08.066
- Now we're working smarter,
not harder.

40:08.066 --> 40:09.567
- I'll see you guys
back at the boat.

40:09.567 --> 40:11.066
- We're out.
- Yeah, I need beauty sleep.

40:11.066 --> 40:12.567
- That was fun.

40:17.367 --> 40:18.600
- I'm sick of everyone.

40:18.600 --> 40:20.367
They all hate me anyways,

40:20.367 --> 40:21.500
so why the f--- am I gonna be
nice?

40:21.500 --> 40:22.767
I'm not one to pretend

40:22.767 --> 40:24.300
that I'm feeling
a different way

40:24.300 --> 40:26.367
than what I actually am.

40:26.367 --> 40:27.700
- There you go.

40:27.700 --> 40:29.333
We'll go back to the boat.
Let's go.

40:29.333 --> 40:32.100
- Perfect.
Let's do it.

40:32.100 --> 40:33.433
Come on, Boo Boo.

40:33.433 --> 40:35.734
F---. Come on.
Come on. Come with me.

40:35.734 --> 40:37.367
- I don't have to have
this f---ing--

40:37.367 --> 40:39.633
I'm gonna piss.
I'm gonna pop a squat.

40:39.633 --> 40:41.333
- [laughs]
- Ow!

40:44.100 --> 40:45.600
- No, no, let's go for--

40:47.300 --> 40:49.066
- Just take them off.

40:49.066 --> 40:50.200
- Boating on "Valor."

40:52.767 --> 40:54.233
- Let's get on with it.
Come on.

40:54.233 --> 40:56.066
Come on, girl.
- No, no, no, no.

40:56.066 --> 40:58.133
I hate you.
I just have to pee.

40:58.133 --> 40:59.133
None of you cared.

40:59.133 --> 41:00.767
I just have to pee!

41:00.767 --> 41:02.734
- Let's go.
You got to pee. Come on.

41:02.734 --> 41:05.467
- Nope, I'm gonna go this way,
'cause you need to go one.

41:05.467 --> 41:07.266
- What's she doing now?
- Being silly.

41:07.266 --> 41:08.734
- Why you being silly?

41:08.734 --> 41:11.400
- 'Cause none of you care.
- Jen, you are--

41:11.400 --> 41:13.767
- Don't f---ing deny
this sh--.

41:13.767 --> 41:15.400
- Holler.
Check ya later.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.200
- Yeah, whatever.
- You're a f---ing idiot.

41:17.200 --> 41:18.767
- Whatever, whore.

41:18.767 --> 41:20.767
both: Whoa.

41:20.767 --> 41:23.633
- I ain't worried about it.
- Jen!

41:23.633 --> 41:25.367
- She's being disrespectful
right now.

41:25.367 --> 41:27.133
- She's a f---ing moron.
- That was ridiculous.

41:27.133 --> 41:28.767
[knocking at door]
- Who is it?

41:28.767 --> 41:30.133
- Housekeeping.

41:30.133 --> 41:31.633
- What the f---
do you want?

41:31.633 --> 41:33.367
- Okay, I'm going to bed.

41:33.367 --> 41:36.233
F---ing no one else
is on the boat, and...

41:40.367 --> 41:41.767
- Jen, I can hear the words

41:41.767 --> 41:43.166
that are coming
out of your mouth.

41:43.166 --> 41:44.700
They just don't make any sense.

41:44.700 --> 41:46.166
- Stop. Go to the hot tub,
and have fun.

41:46.166 --> 41:47.166
- No.
Stick up for yourself.

41:47.166 --> 41:48.700
That's bullsh--.

41:48.700 --> 41:50.567
- Baker called me a name,
and I called her a name.

41:50.567 --> 41:52.033
I just want to go to bed.

41:52.033 --> 41:53.033
- Where the f--- do you get off

41:53.033 --> 41:54.500
calling someone a whore?

41:54.500 --> 41:56.500
- This had nothing to do
with these two.

41:56.500 --> 41:58.300
- No, so why'd you come in here
saying you were attacked--

41:58.300 --> 42:00.633
- What the f--- are you
even talking about?

42:00.633 --> 42:03.133
I'm not talking about "we."
This is between me and Baker.

42:03.133 --> 42:05.300
So f--- off!

42:05.300 --> 42:06.300
Baker...

42:06.300 --> 42:07.433
[all arguing]

42:07.433 --> 42:09.166
- Shut up.
You weren't there.

42:09.166 --> 42:10.400
- Jen, Jen.
- Don't f---ing push my hand.

42:10.400 --> 42:12.166
- You have
a f---ing child.

42:12.166 --> 42:13.433
- You're not letting her
f---ing speak for herself.

42:13.433 --> 42:15.433
- 'Cause she doesn't need it.

42:15.433 --> 42:17.000
- I don't need this sh--
either!

42:17.000 --> 42:18.033
- Jen.

42:18.033 --> 42:21.033
[all arguing]

42:21.033 --> 42:22.333
- Back down!

42:22.333 --> 42:23.734
- I'm gonna lock you
in a bathroom

42:23.734 --> 42:25.467
if you're still screaming
at me.

42:25.467 --> 42:27.133
- F--- you, you will never lock
me in a bathroom.

42:27.133 --> 42:28.700
Get your f---ing--
- Guys, guys, guys.

42:28.700 --> 42:31.467
- Oh!
- F--- you!

42:31.467 --> 42:33.300
- Next time on "Below Deck"...

42:33.300 --> 42:34.467
- That girl should be gone
today.

42:34.467 --> 42:36.266
- May I say something?

42:36.266 --> 42:37.433
- I don't want to hear
your voice right now.

42:37.433 --> 42:39.066
This is not a conversation.

42:39.066 --> 42:40.200
- "The primary charter guest
will be arriving

42:40.200 --> 42:42.033
via alternative watercraft"?

42:43.133 --> 42:44.567
- F---ing morons.

42:44.567 --> 42:46.400
- Looks like a nicer boat
this year.

42:46.400 --> 42:48.033
I'm proud of you.
This is your moment to shine.

42:48.033 --> 42:49.533
Do we have protective goggles?

42:49.533 --> 42:51.467
Champagne will burn your eyes.

42:51.467 --> 42:52.700
- Ah, sh--!

42:52.700 --> 42:54.467
The pain is just taking over.

42:54.467 --> 42:57.166
- How I handle
my stewardesses

42:57.166 --> 42:59.033
shouldn't affect
how hard you work.

42:59.033 --> 43:00.467
- So you're saying
I'm not working hard?

43:00.467 --> 43:02.100
- I think you should
make it less personal.

43:02.100 --> 43:03.734
- Well, it's not--
- I'm not done.

43:03.734 --> 43:05.734
