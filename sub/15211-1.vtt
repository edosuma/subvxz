WEBVTT

00:52.122 --> 00:55.558
I'm not a Christian,
I'm not an Atheist.

00:55.559 --> 00:57.284
I'm not Jewish,

00:57.285 --> 00:58.856
I'm not Muslim.

00:58.857 --> 01:03.149
My Religion...
What I believe in?

01:03.150 --> 01:07.850
It's called, the Constitution
of the United States of America.

01:25.917 --> 01:27.653
Hang on.
- Did you get that?

01:27.654 --> 01:32.354
Let me open this up.

02:06.876 --> 02:10.756
Okay, go ahead.

02:10.757 --> 02:14.417
If I'm not religious enough
for you, don't vote for me.

02:14.418 --> 02:16.724
If I'm not... uh...

02:16.725 --> 02:21.425
experience enough for you,
don't vote for me.

02:25.085 --> 02:27.261
You know what,
don't vote for me.

02:27.262 --> 02:29.887
Don't...
Don't do it.

02:29.888 --> 02:31.793
Whatever you do,
don't vote for me. How's that?

02:31.794 --> 02:33.937
- Okay.
- Okay, thanks.

02:33.938 --> 02:36.735
Can we get the monitors up a little,
I'd like the governor to be able to hear himself?

02:36.736 --> 02:38.421
You got it.

02:38.422 --> 02:43.836
Also, are we gonna put raisers under this podiums,
like we discussed in the pre-conditions?

02:43.837 --> 02:44.837
- No, I know.

02:44.663 --> 02:47.117
We canned inspection last night.

02:47.118 --> 02:48.412
They'll make something slide under there.

02:48.413 --> 02:49.753
- Okay, thank you.

02:49.754 --> 02:50.784
It's just they're few inches short.

02:50.785 --> 02:51.785
It makes it hard for him
to read his notes.

02:51.786 --> 02:53.225
- Okay.

02:53.226 --> 02:55.569
Gentlemen, Thank you...
and I'll see you in few hours.

02:55.570 --> 02:58.451
I didn't know the governor has trouble
reading his notes. Why doesn't he wear glasses?

02:58.452 --> 02:59.894
No, he doesn't. Just, Pullman's just 5/8.

02:59.895 --> 03:04.595
He's gonna look like a Hobbit.

03:04.903 --> 03:09.603
THE IDES OF MARCH

03:23.048 --> 03:25.524
<i>Well, it all comes down to this.</i>

03:25.525 --> 03:28.271
<i>We are one week away,
from the Ohio Primary.</i>

03:28.272 --> 03:29.272
<i>Two Democrats are left standing.</i>

03:29.273 --> 03:31.303
<i>Senator Pullman of Arkansas...</i>

03:31.304 --> 03:34.355
<i>trailing Gov. Morris of Pennsylvania.</i>

03:34.356 --> 03:36.278
<i>Gov. Morris has mounted a sizeable lead.</i>

03:36.279 --> 03:38.623
<i>With two thousand and fourty seven delegates.</i>

03:38.624 --> 03:41.905
<i>Winning New Hampshire, California...
New York and Michigan.</i>

03:41.906 --> 03:45.096
<i>But Sen. Pullman with
thirteen hundred and two delegates...</i>

03:45.097 --> 03:46.097
<i>is still in the hunt,</i>

03:46.098 --> 03:47.986
<i>Having won Florida and Tennessee...</i>

03:47.987 --> 03:49.771
<i>and Virginia and Missouri.</i>

03:49.772 --> 03:52.271
<i>A win in Ohio could turn it all around.</i>

03:52.272 --> 03:54.771
<i>For the Arkansas Senator.</i>

03:54.772 --> 03:58.938
<i>One week from Tuesday,
the all important Hundred and sixty-one Ohio delegates...</i>

03:58.939 --> 04:00.832
<i>could be the deciding factor.</i>

04:00.833 --> 04:01.833
<i>Once again, it is true...</i>

04:01.834 --> 04:06.534
<i>'As goes Ohio... so goes the nation'.</i>

04:07.912 --> 04:09.425
<i><font color="#804040">Sen. Pullman:</font>
But you call yourself a Christian.</i>

04:09.426 --> 04:10.426
<i>- How would that matter?
- Let me quote.</i>

04:10.412 --> 04:12.911
Let me quote:
" I have no Idea what happens when we die.

04:12.912 --> 04:16.971
Maybe, nothing.
Maybe, it's like before we were born".

04:16.973 --> 04:17.916
You did write this Governor.

04:17.918 --> 04:18.918
Let me be specific.

04:18.593 --> 04:20.137
- Please do.

04:20.137 --> 04:23.001
I was raised a Catholic,
and I am no practising Catholic.

04:23.002 --> 04:25.559
And I have no idea,
what happens after we die.

04:25.560 --> 04:29.186
If the senator does,
then... maybe you should be the President.

04:29.187 --> 04:31.063
Is that your idea of being specific?

04:31.064 --> 04:32.664
Let me be more specific.

04:32.665 --> 04:34.438
- Thank you.

04:34.439 --> 04:36.326
I'm not a Christian or an Atheist.

04:36.327 --> 04:37.327
I'm not Jewish or Muslim.

04:37.328 --> 04:38.866
What I believe...

04:38.867 --> 04:41.366
My Religion is written on a piece of paper
called the Constitution.

04:41.367 --> 04:45.932
Meaning, that I'd defend until
my dying breath your right to worship...

04:45.933 --> 04:47.722
In whatever God you believe in.

04:47.723 --> 04:49.857
As long as it doesn't hurt others.

04:49.858 --> 04:53.340
I believe, we should be judged as a country
by how we take care of the people...

04:53.341 --> 04:55.091
who cannot take care of themselves.

04:55.092 --> 04:56.243
That's my religion!

04:56.244 --> 04:58.841
If you think I'm not religious enough,
don't vote for me.

04:58.842 --> 05:01.766
If you think I'm not experience enough
or tall enough...

05:01.767 --> 05:02.814
then, don't vote for me.

05:02.815 --> 05:04.606
'Cos I can't change that to get elected.

05:04.607 --> 05:08.781
- I just want you to say out loud,
if you believe in the teachings of the Bible?

05:08.782 --> 05:12.130
Is this a Democratic primary
or a general election?

05:12.131 --> 05:13.131
Well, Governor whoever wins this contest...

05:13.132 --> 05:14.885
will be running for the President.

05:14.886 --> 05:17.015
And If you think,
that this questions...

05:17.016 --> 05:19.184
won't be central in the general election.

05:19.185 --> 05:21.384
Then, you're living in Fantasy Land!

05:21.385 --> 05:23.074
I'm simply pointing to the obvious.

05:23.075 --> 05:26.100
We are running for
President of The United States.

05:26.101 --> 05:30.801
Not, Student Council President.

05:57.076 --> 05:59.893
Fucking National Security.

05:59.894 --> 06:04.594
Out of the park.
- Home run.

06:11.995 --> 06:16.695
You know, I'm trying to remember if the
Democrats have ever nominated an Atheist before.

06:16.987 --> 06:21.122
- Well, we know they've nominated a JackAss before.

06:21.123 --> 06:23.712
That must've been you,
that did the prep work... Steven.

06:23.713 --> 06:25.353
Paul's not that clever.

06:25.354 --> 06:28.380
- You've always said the brain stuffs about me.

06:28.381 --> 06:29.463
I've had the Balls.

06:29.464 --> 06:33.574
Well, it looks like
you've got some brains now, too.

06:33.575 --> 06:38.275
Becareful, I just might have
to steal him from you.

06:39.285 --> 06:43.985
What a Prick!

07:06.598 --> 07:08.690
So... Paul, tell me something
I don't know.

07:08.691 --> 07:12.491
Tell me what's going to
happen on the 15th?

07:12.492 --> 07:16.672
What?

07:16.673 --> 07:18.484
What do you think, Stevie?

07:18.485 --> 07:23.185
- I think it's ours for the taking.
What do you think?

07:23.678 --> 07:26.209
What do you think... Ida?

07:26.210 --> 07:27.943
- I'm asking you.

07:27.944 --> 07:30.266
Well, you tell me... I'll tell you.

07:30.267 --> 07:31.997
- If I have to say, I'd say...

07:31.998 --> 07:33.438
It will be close.
But, You'll eek it out.

07:33.439 --> 07:36.048
Eek?

07:36.049 --> 07:38.572
You see, she's trying to get under my skin.

07:38.573 --> 07:39.573
- So, what's gonna happen?

07:39.056 --> 07:42.064
Us... by Nine.

07:42.065 --> 07:44.285
- So, you're certain you're gonna win here?

07:44.286 --> 07:45.894
Certain? No.
But, confident? Yeah.

07:45.895 --> 07:46.895
You just said, you'll win by nine.

07:46.786 --> 07:48.072
And I think that we will!

07:48.073 --> 07:49.285
But I'm not gonna tell you,
It's a sure thing,

07:49.286 --> 07:51.785
I mean, fucking St. Gabriel
could blow his horn on election day...

07:51.786 --> 07:54.328
and get his four horsemen
to rig the ballot box for Pullman...

07:54.329 --> 07:56.455
and it wouldn't surprise me.

07:56.456 --> 07:59.183
Six Presidentials that I've done
and I've never felt this good.

07:59.184 --> 08:02.749
But, I'm not gonna sit here and say...
Yeah, hey... we'll win Ohio.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.446
Not a chance.

08:04.447 --> 08:07.911
In the last 30 years, seventy-three Democrats
have run for President... How many have won?

08:07.912 --> 08:08.912
Three.

08:08.763 --> 08:11.393
That means, 70 guys have run
with the thought that they had a chance,

08:11.394 --> 08:13.486
and they all lost.

08:13.487 --> 08:15.795
- So, you're saying... there's a good chance
that you won't win?

08:15.796 --> 08:18.258
Don't twist my words, Ida.
What I'm saying is...

08:18.259 --> 08:20.207
I'm not gonna promise you we'll win.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.707
But he's decorated by Bush Senior
from the first Gulf War...

08:22.708 --> 08:25.207
He protested the second
and he left the state with a balance...

08:25.208 --> 08:27.895
budget and the 4th highest education rate.

08:27.896 --> 08:28.976
The Republicans...

08:28.977 --> 08:31.664
have no one out there,
that could touch this guy.

08:31.665 --> 08:32.703
So, for this moment:

08:32.705 --> 08:37.405
This election... this primary is
the presidential.

08:37.528 --> 08:41.710
And that... Ida...
is the state of the union.

08:41.711 --> 08:44.487
And on that note--

08:44.488 --> 08:48.337
I'm gonna take a shit.

08:48.338 --> 08:49.538
So, Steven?

08:49.539 --> 08:50.803
- So, Ida.

08:50.804 --> 08:52.403
Steven, Steven... Steven.

08:52.404 --> 08:53.967
- Ida, Ida... Ida.

08:53.968 --> 08:54.968
What's going on at the airport?

08:54.969 --> 08:55.969
Yeah.

08:55.970 --> 08:57.210
And getting on a plane.

08:57.211 --> 08:58.887
- That's what you do, at the airport. Yeah.

08:58.888 --> 09:00.796
Where's that plane going?

09:00.797 --> 09:02.662
Okay,

09:02.663 --> 09:04.827
I'll give you three guesses.

09:04.828 --> 09:06.385
He's not going back to Head Quarters.

09:06.386 --> 09:07.386
- Correct.

09:07.152 --> 09:08.771
He's not going to Texas?

09:08.772 --> 09:09.772
- No need.

09:09.773 --> 09:10.962
We're gonna split Texas,
so it's a wash.

09:10.963 --> 09:12.781
What if I've said, North Carolina?

09:12.782 --> 09:14.881
- I'll say, a guess.

09:14.882 --> 09:16.148
He's going to North Carolina.

09:16.149 --> 09:17.149
- I can't neither confirm or deny that.

09:17.150 --> 09:19.251
I knew it.
Now, tell me why?

09:19.252 --> 09:21.451
I cannot do that.

09:21.452 --> 09:22.756
I hate you.

09:22.757 --> 09:24.395
- You love me.

09:24.396 --> 09:25.956
I love Paul.
You... hate.

09:25.957 --> 09:27.890
You love him,
because he gives you the scoops.

09:27.891 --> 09:29.375
Sexual favours.

09:29.376 --> 09:30.960
You're engaged?

09:30.961 --> 09:35.653
If it meant a good scoop...
my fiancee will understand.

09:35.654 --> 09:38.092
You're really buying into this crap.

09:38.093 --> 09:40.399
All this take back the country nonsense.

09:40.400 --> 09:41.977
Ida?

09:41.978 --> 09:43.667
I'm not naive, okay?

09:43.668 --> 09:46.778
I've worked on more campaigns
most people will have, by the time they're 40.

09:46.779 --> 09:49.723
I'm telling you...
This is the One!

09:49.724 --> 09:51.337
You really have drunk the cool-aid?

09:51.338 --> 09:54.457
- I have drunk. It's delicious!

09:54.458 --> 09:55.222
Look?

09:55.223 --> 09:57.536
I don't care if he happens to be
leading in the polls...

09:57.537 --> 10:00.029
I don't care if he happens to have
all the right tools...

10:00.030 --> 10:01.010
The truth is...

10:01.011 --> 10:02.488
He's the only one...

10:02.489 --> 10:05.608
that's gonna actually
make a difference in peoples lives.

10:05.609 --> 10:07.606
Even the people, that hate him.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.666
If Mike Morris is President,
this is more about us...

10:10.667 --> 10:11.667
then it does about him.

10:11.668 --> 10:14.850
I don't give a fuck...
If he can't win.

10:14.851 --> 10:16.067
He has to win.

10:16.068 --> 10:17.209
- Or what?

10:17.210 --> 10:21.049
The world's gonna fall apart?

10:21.050 --> 10:23.021
It won't matter.

10:23.022 --> 10:24.951
Not one bit...

10:24.952 --> 10:28.675
To the everyday lives of the
everyday fuckers, who get up,

10:28.676 --> 10:31.863
and work and eat and sleep.
Go back to work again.

10:31.864 --> 10:32.864
If your boy wins...

10:32.865 --> 10:35.207
You get a job in the White House.

10:35.208 --> 10:38.771
He looses, you're back
at a consulting firm on K-street.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.827
That's it!

10:40.828 --> 10:45.528
You used to know that,
before you got goosebumpy about this guy.

10:45.589 --> 10:47.919
Mike Morris is a politician.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.836
He's a nice guy.
They're all nice guys!

10:50.837 --> 10:53.465
He will let you down.

10:53.466 --> 10:58.166
Sooner or later.

11:13.758 --> 11:14.842
This is 'off-off' the record.

11:14.843 --> 11:16.692
- What?

11:16.693 --> 11:18.006
Franklin Thompson...

11:18.007 --> 11:19.007
- Seriously?

11:19.008 --> 11:20.008
Off the record.

11:20.009 --> 11:21.009
Going through the Governor, Steven and Me.

11:21.010 --> 11:23.429
- My lips are sealed.

11:23.430 --> 11:25.089
Tomorrow I have a meeting
at Thompson's house.

11:25.090 --> 11:26.765
- He's going to endorse us?

11:26.766 --> 11:28.477
After I'm done talking to him.
What do you think?

11:28.478 --> 11:30.550
- That's huge!

11:30.551 --> 11:31.890
It's more than huge.

11:31.891 --> 11:34.477
There's 356 pledged delegates...

11:34.478 --> 11:36.066
They all travels with him.

11:36.067 --> 11:38.038
Puts us over the top.

11:38.039 --> 11:40.408
- He said publicly,
he's not gonna endorse anybody.

11:40.409 --> 11:40.949
Yeah, well...

11:40.950 --> 11:43.313
That's what they all say,
until you get 'em alone at the room.

11:43.314 --> 11:44.746
- So, this is for real?

11:44.747 --> 11:46.440
Yup.

11:46.441 --> 11:47.865
Just gotta put it in the bag.

11:47.866 --> 11:50.113
- When are you gonna announce?

11:50.114 --> 11:53.819
Nope, that's all you get for now.

11:53.820 --> 11:56.537
Okay, listen up!

11:56.538 --> 11:58.280
These are your new cellphones.

11:58.281 --> 11:59.766
Shelley's pre-programmed the numbers,

11:59.767 --> 12:00.767
Thank you Shelley.
No personal calls.

12:00.768 --> 12:01.925
Kevin?

12:01.926 --> 12:03.547
If you loose them,

12:03.548 --> 12:05.503
The D.M.C will come to your house.

12:05.504 --> 12:07.204
New cellphone,
just gave em all new ones.

12:07.205 --> 12:08.205
I'll get it later.

12:08.206 --> 12:10.390
<i><font color="#804040">Morris on TV:</font> ...I gotta believe we can do it.</i>

12:10.391 --> 12:12.229
<i>We have enemies,
we have to understand.</i>

12:12.230 --> 12:13.294
<i>Why our enemies are our enemies?</i>

12:13.295 --> 12:15.292
<i>And see if there's something we can do about it.</i>

12:15.293 --> 12:17.586
<i>Besides, just using force.
As we know...</i>

12:17.587 --> 12:21.552
<i>From history, the answer to extremism
can't be extremism.</i>

12:21.553 --> 12:23.374
Fucking kill me.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.826
Where did we get this?

12:25.827 --> 12:28.131
Sometime, in Pennsylvania before he annouce.

12:28.132 --> 12:30.111
Thank God, he was in overseas.

12:30.112 --> 12:30.941
Just get rid of it.

12:30.942 --> 12:32.611
Yeah, but if this was already placed,
why would this bother us...

12:32.612 --> 12:33.495
Are you fucking stoned?

12:33.496 --> 12:36.675
This is exact same piece The Republicans,
are gonna run against him in the general.

12:36.676 --> 12:38.618
We don't need to brag about it.

12:38.619 --> 12:41.118
<i>"Hi, I'm Neville Chamberlain.
I'd like to be your Commander in Chief."</i>

12:41.119 --> 12:42.528
- But then, this is gonna come out anyways.

12:42.529 --> 12:43.529
It's gonna come out.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.987
But it's not gonna come out
'Paid For It by Us' pal.

12:46.988 --> 12:49.487
You think there's any truth,
in this... Pullman having investments...

12:49.488 --> 12:51.987
diamond mines in Liberia?

12:51.988 --> 12:52.931
- Still checking on it.

12:52.932 --> 12:55.259
But, we got it from a blog,
who the fuck knows.

12:55.260 --> 12:57.844
- I don't care, if it's true...
I just wanna hear him denying it.

12:57.845 --> 13:00.440
If it's true... Great!
Find out. If not...

13:00.441 --> 13:02.847
let them spend the day,
telling The Post,

13:02.848 --> 13:05.556
that he doesn't own
a diamond mine in Liberia.

13:05.557 --> 13:06.594
Win-Win.

13:06.595 --> 13:09.259
Okay.

13:09.260 --> 13:11.852
We gotta counter that Christian shit,
we take it from last night.

13:11.853 --> 13:14.126
I need the new 30 in 60 seconds spot.

13:14.127 --> 13:18.827
We can show him in
staff meeting this afternoon.

13:26.402 --> 13:27.182
Hey.
- Hey.

13:27.183 --> 13:29.630
Uhh... Ben wanted me
to get you sign off on this,

13:29.631 --> 13:31.767
Before the staff meeting.

13:31.768 --> 13:36.468
Thank you, I've been waiting for this.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.000
Anything interesting?

13:40.001 --> 13:42.255
Just these some White Paper
I've to hand out tonight.

13:42.256 --> 13:44.574
- What's White Paper?

13:44.575 --> 13:47.144
Negative shits.

13:47.145 --> 13:51.035
Our guys do research...
we feed it to the press and we see what sticks.

13:51.036 --> 13:53.631
- What kind of negative shits?

13:53.632 --> 13:55.665
You'll read it in the paper tomorrow.

13:55.666 --> 13:56.666
- Which paper?

13:56.667 --> 13:59.418
Any, any paper.

13:59.419 --> 14:01.084
- So, it's something big?

14:01.085 --> 14:03.033
I wish it was something bigger.

14:03.034 --> 14:04.699
It's just these...

14:04.700 --> 14:08.240
transportation numbers I'm gonna
have to spend pretty hard to make it stick.

14:08.241 --> 14:09.680
- That's what you're good at though, right?

14:09.681 --> 14:11.754
I guess.

14:11.755 --> 14:15.316
Tell him it's fine.

14:15.317 --> 14:16.603
Did you get your new phone?

14:16.604 --> 14:18.120
- Mmm hm.

14:18.121 --> 14:20.770
It's really exciting isn't it?

14:20.771 --> 14:23.169
What are you, a Bearcat?

14:23.170 --> 14:24.970
- Am I a what?

14:24.971 --> 14:26.988
Cincinatti Bearcat?

14:26.989 --> 14:31.171
Ohh! No... I'm not from here.

14:31.172 --> 14:35.872
I worked with you in Iowa, actually.

14:35.970 --> 14:37.757
That's right.

14:37.758 --> 14:39.951
You changed something.

14:39.952 --> 14:41.419
My hair?

14:41.420 --> 14:43.059
You changed your hair?

14:43.060 --> 14:46.126
- No.

14:46.127 --> 14:47.901
I see.

14:47.902 --> 14:50.493
I betcha, I look like a
real dumb-ass right now, huh?

14:50.494 --> 14:52.022
- No! Not at all.

14:52.023 --> 14:55.359
You're the big man on campus.
I'm just a lowly intern.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.122
Oh, it's not like that.

14:57.123 --> 14:59.072
You get to stay at The Millennium.

14:59.073 --> 15:01.389
Okay? They put us in a Motel on the
other side of the river.

15:01.390 --> 15:03.583
You're right.
I am the big man on campus.

15:03.584 --> 15:04.584
- Now you're starting to see.

15:04.427 --> 15:05.506
Mm hmm.

15:05.507 --> 15:07.861
We do have a better bar, though.

15:07.862 --> 15:09.066
I've heard that.

15:09.067 --> 15:10.984
You should come by, one night.

15:10.985 --> 15:13.050
Have a drink with the worker-bees.

15:13.051 --> 15:15.245
I might do that.

15:15.246 --> 15:16.835
I might do that.
What's a good night?

15:16.836 --> 15:17.836
- Tonight's good.
- Tonight?

15:17.837 --> 15:19.990
Tuesday night?
- Yeah.

15:19.991 --> 15:20.991
It's quite.

15:20.992 --> 15:25.128
Quite's good.

15:25.129 --> 15:27.683
Well, you have my number.

15:27.684 --> 15:29.834
- I do?

15:29.835 --> 15:31.664
It's programmed right there on your phone.

15:31.665 --> 15:33.548
- Uh huh.

15:33.549 --> 15:34.964
Under... Mary.

15:34.965 --> 15:39.331
I know your name is Mary.

15:39.332 --> 15:44.032
- My name is Molly.

15:54.117 --> 15:55.932
That's what I'm hearing since.

15:55.933 --> 16:00.149
Super Tuesday. All of a sudden,
I am a popular guy.

16:00.150 --> 16:02.173
What are the polls telling you?

16:02.174 --> 16:04.688
That Pullman's negatives are high.

16:04.689 --> 16:07.259
Coming at fourties.

16:07.260 --> 16:10.560
Senator, we have an open seat at White House.

16:10.561 --> 16:12.394
Republicans have dick.

16:12.395 --> 16:14.344
They're disorganised...

16:14.345 --> 16:18.044
they can't find a nominee,
that's not a world class fucked up.

16:18.045 --> 16:20.822
They look like Democrats.

16:20.823 --> 16:24.891
No Republicans are gonna show up
to vote their guy.

16:24.892 --> 16:28.562
But if Pullman's got a Democratic nod,
they will show up to vote against him.

16:28.563 --> 16:31.257
You think, if they won't for your guy,
you think Morris gets into the independents?

16:31.258 --> 16:32.872
I sure do.

16:32.873 --> 16:36.597
Senator, I'm a bit confused.

16:36.598 --> 16:39.667
We need your delegates.

16:39.668 --> 16:41.619
We need you,

16:41.620 --> 16:44.029
your fund raising...

16:44.030 --> 16:47.709
and I guess,

16:47.710 --> 16:49.659
It was my understanding that,

16:49.660 --> 16:52.549
your endorsement, a week for Ohio-

16:52.550 --> 16:57.250
would win this for us.

17:00.572 --> 17:01.529
Thank you.

17:01.530 --> 17:03.619
Stella.

17:03.620 --> 17:08.319
Hand me that Ice-bucket.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.931
Is this Paul or is this you?

17:10.932 --> 17:12.723
Paul knows and Paul agrees.

17:12.724 --> 17:14.954
Ben, where's my outback piece on National Service?

17:14.954 --> 17:16.964
It's easy for me to work off with that.

17:16.964 --> 17:17.964
- Got it right here.

17:17.965 --> 17:20.848
Get me a hard copy,
I hate those fucking things.

17:20.849 --> 17:25.199
- Molly, can you grab that out for me.
- Yeah, one second.

17:25.200 --> 17:29.900
So, Governor if you wanna change...
- Just give me a sec, will you.

17:33.460 --> 17:37.563
Your National Service isn't pulling
the same as the rest of your Domestic Policy.

17:37.564 --> 17:38.439
I don't give a shit about the polling...

17:38.440 --> 17:40.879
Steven, I'm not gonna play this game with you.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.582
This is your,
good cop-bad cop act with Paul.

17:43.583 --> 17:44.583
- Good cop... good cop.

17:44.584 --> 17:49.284
I'm not changing it.

17:59.070 --> 18:00.789
Here we go.

18:00.790 --> 18:03.965
Alright, let's see.

18:03.966 --> 18:05.091
It says, we're gonna...

18:05.092 --> 18:07.941
Help them get education,
We're gonna create a national unity.

18:07.942 --> 18:09.749
We're gonna teach young people to trade.

18:09.750 --> 18:12.781
And... we are going to get them out of debt,
from their college loans.

18:12.782 --> 18:13.782
Now, where does that fail?

18:13.783 --> 18:14.939
- All of that is exactly right, Governor.

18:14.940 --> 18:17.719
It's just that,
if you're gonna do it... do it.

18:17.720 --> 18:20.629
Make it mandatory, not voluntary.

18:20.630 --> 18:21.897
That'll poll well.

18:21.898 --> 18:23.299
- Mandatory.

18:23.300 --> 18:27.480
Everybody who turns eighteen or
graduates high-school gives two years of service...

18:27.481 --> 18:28.481
to his or her country.

18:28.450 --> 18:30.949
It could be in the military,
peace corps...

18:30.950 --> 18:33.449
plant a fucking trees... I don't care.
And for that...

18:33.450 --> 18:35.549
your college education is paid for.
Period.

18:35.550 --> 18:36.550
- We do all of that right here.

18:36.551 --> 18:37.551
No, sir. You don't.

18:37.552 --> 18:38.989
Not all the way.
Do it all the way.

18:38.990 --> 18:40.519
Mandatory.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.359
- Paul likes this?
- Mmm hm.

18:42.360 --> 18:44.669
You're my brain trust.

18:44.670 --> 18:47.368
The beauty of it is,
everybody who's over the age of 18

18:47.369 --> 18:49.788
or pass age of eligibility
will be for it.

18:49.789 --> 18:50.789
Why not?

18:50.540 --> 18:52.140
And all of the others?

18:52.141 --> 18:54.649
Can't vote.

18:54.650 --> 18:59.350
Too young.

19:00.660 --> 19:05.360
Too bad.

19:07.140 --> 19:11.840
You can't loose.

19:11.885 --> 19:14.084
Uh, Steven?

19:14.085 --> 19:15.344
You have a call on line 3.

19:15.345 --> 19:16.798
It's your dad.

19:16.799 --> 19:19.279
Okay!

19:19.280 --> 19:22.481
You and Ben get working on this
stump speech and you get me a hard copy.

19:22.482 --> 19:23.839
And I'll write it my own words.

19:23.840 --> 19:25.675
Don't forget your Charlie Ross at Six.

19:25.676 --> 19:26.676
- Right.

19:26.550 --> 19:27.839
What am I doing here?

19:27.840 --> 19:29.778
- It's on low form,
he's flying in.

19:29.779 --> 19:30.919
Paul going?

19:30.920 --> 19:35.620
Paul won't be here,
but Ben and I will take you.

19:36.020 --> 19:37.360
Just don't tell me someone just died.

19:37.361 --> 19:38.939
<i>- Hey, Steve?</i>

19:38.940 --> 19:39.900
Who is this?

19:39.901 --> 19:40.901
<i>- Tom Duffy.</i>

19:40.902 --> 19:42.812
<i>Sorry about the dad bit.</i>

19:42.813 --> 19:47.574
<i>I uh, I just figured you wouldn't
my name called out on Morris's Campaign Office.</i>

19:47.770 --> 19:49.739
What do you want?

19:49.740 --> 19:51.759
<i>- You got a couple of minutes,
I'd like to sit down with you?</i>

19:51.760 --> 19:52.810
What for?

19:52.811 --> 19:55.039
<i>- Well, it's important.</i>

19:55.040 --> 19:59.740
Well, if it's important,
don't you think you should be calling Paul?

20:04.300 --> 20:06.523
<i>- This is on the up and up, Steve.
Just give me five minutes.</i>

20:06.524 --> 20:07.260
I can't be talking to you.

20:07.261 --> 20:08.849
<i>- I hear you.</i>

20:08.850 --> 20:11.707
<i>But if you have five minutes,
I'm gonna be on the Hadfort's sports bar.</i>

20:11.708 --> 20:12.708
<i>For the next couple of hours.</i>

20:12.709 --> 20:15.659
I can't, Tom.

20:15.660 --> 20:17.100
<i>- There won't be anybody there.</i>

20:17.101 --> 20:19.269
<i>Okay?</i>

20:19.270 --> 20:23.970
<i>If you get the chance,
there's something I wanna show to you.</i>

20:40.460 --> 20:45.160
Paul, call me back.
It's important.

20:54.131 --> 20:55.278
<i><font color="#804040">Tom:</font> You're working for the wrong man.</i>

20:55.279 --> 20:56.440
- You are working for the wrong man.
- Oh, on the contrary...

20:56.441 --> 20:59.589
You're working for the wrong man.

20:59.590 --> 21:01.649
And you've got something that
the other guys don't have.

21:01.650 --> 21:02.372
- Oh, yeah?

21:02.373 --> 21:03.373
Yeah, what is that exactly?

21:03.110 --> 21:05.493
Charm... is not the right word.

21:05.494 --> 21:06.301
It is the right word.

21:06.302 --> 21:07.849
No, it's more than that.

21:07.850 --> 21:11.849
You exudes something.
You draw people in.

21:11.850 --> 21:13.859
All reporters love you.
Even the ones that hates you.

21:13.860 --> 21:15.059
Love you.

21:15.060 --> 21:17.498
Cos, you play them all like
they're pieces on chess-board.

21:17.499 --> 21:19.889
And you make it look, effortless!

21:19.890 --> 21:21.819
We both know, How hard it is.

21:21.820 --> 21:23.373
Constantly be on guard...

21:23.374 --> 21:26.599
weighing every word,
every moment.

21:26.600 --> 21:31.069
From the outside, you make it look easy.

21:31.070 --> 21:33.770
People are scared of you,
cos they don't understand how you do it.

21:33.771 --> 21:35.539
And they love you, for it!

21:35.540 --> 21:38.769
And that is the most
valuable thing in this business.

21:38.770 --> 21:40.529
The ability to win people's respect,

21:40.530 --> 21:44.183
By making them mistake their fear, for love.

21:44.184 --> 21:45.630
You can guess what I'm gonna say next.

21:45.631 --> 21:46.670
- I don't think that I can.

21:46.671 --> 21:49.569
I want you to work for us.

21:49.570 --> 21:51.250
- Well, you're kidding.

21:51.251 --> 21:54.869
No, not in the least.

21:54.870 --> 21:56.559
You're gonna loose Ohio.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.019
- I'm not.

21:58.020 --> 22:00.319
You're sitting on about a six percent
lead on both polls.

22:00.320 --> 22:03.015
Six percent of all Democrats poll.

22:03.016 --> 22:04.016
- Eight!

22:04.017 --> 22:05.017
No. Six.

22:05.018 --> 22:06.018
Doesn't matter.

22:05.650 --> 22:08.039
Ohio is an open primary, right.

22:08.040 --> 22:11.279
Independents and Republicans
get to vote on the Democratic candidates.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.289
- Do you think, they like your guy?

22:13.290 --> 22:16.550
A pro-choice tax and spend the roof.

22:16.551 --> 22:17.999
Fuck no!
They hate him.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.839
They think they can beat my guy.

22:20.840 --> 22:25.540
But they're very worried about yours.

22:25.700 --> 22:29.955
So, start tomorrow morning,
they're gonna see a fucking blitz.

22:29.956 --> 22:32.261
Lymboyle, Hennedy
all those right wing blocks,

22:32.262 --> 22:34.429
are starting the 'get out the vote' campaign.

22:34.430 --> 22:36.349
It's started already.

22:36.350 --> 22:38.639
Every fucking conservative in Ohio...

22:38.640 --> 22:41.020
Is gonna line up around the block,
to punch my guy's ticket.

22:41.021 --> 22:42.021
And that's just one step!

22:42.022 --> 22:44.509
Ohio's gone.

22:44.510 --> 22:46.169
Polls don't mean shit.

22:46.170 --> 22:48.149
Tomorrow morning,
everybody's gonna know.

22:48.150 --> 22:52.850
And that's why, I want you to
handle the fall-out that we'll have in the press.

22:54.931 --> 22:57.589
Oh, we got Thompson in the bag, too.

22:57.590 --> 22:59.796
- I know for a fact,
that you don't have Thompson.

22:59.797 --> 23:01.431
Well, we promised him Secretary of State.

23:01.432 --> 23:06.132
Ohio is over.
It has been over for weeks.

23:07.140 --> 23:10.869
And now with Thompson's delegates?

23:10.870 --> 23:12.359
I'm thinking down the road here, man.

23:12.360 --> 23:14.719
That is why, I want you.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.639
- I can't do it!
- Wring in straight at the top.

23:17.640 --> 23:20.209
I don't need an answer
right this moment.

23:20.210 --> 23:21.836
Look, I play dirty, alright.

23:21.837 --> 23:22.837
I'm sorry to hear that.

23:22.838 --> 23:23.838
- But I don't have to play dirty anymore.

23:23.839 --> 23:25.799
You know why?

23:25.800 --> 23:27.026
I got Morris!

23:27.027 --> 23:29.875
None of this is about
The Democratic process, Steve.

23:29.876 --> 23:30.876
It is about getting your guy off.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.373
- This is the kind of shit
that The Republicans pull.

23:32.374 --> 23:34.578
Yeah, You know what?
This is the kind of shit,

23:34.579 --> 23:35.579
that The Republicans pull.

23:35.580 --> 23:38.039
And it's about time,
that we learn from them.

23:38.040 --> 23:39.230
They're meaner, they are tougher...

23:39.231 --> 23:42.179
They are more disciplined than we are.

23:42.180 --> 23:45.319
I've been in this business 25 years,
and I've seen way too many Democrats...

23:45.320 --> 23:46.594
bite the dust.

23:46.595 --> 23:51.295
Because they wouldn't get down the mud,
with the fucking elephants!

23:56.790 --> 23:57.782
Paul's my friend.

23:57.783 --> 23:58.783
You wanna work for the friend...

23:58.784 --> 24:02.641
or do you wanna work for the President?

24:02.642 --> 24:03.591
Think about it.

24:03.592 --> 24:08.292
You got my number.

24:08.347 --> 24:09.046
Paul?

24:09.047 --> 24:11.249
- Is there anymore...?
That we're doing??

24:11.250 --> 24:13.051
Not that I'm aware of.

24:13.052 --> 24:14.844
What's going on with Thompson?

24:14.845 --> 24:18.366
- Ahh, he wants something...

24:18.367 --> 24:20.400
we'll be fine.

24:20.401 --> 24:23.381
What's so important?

24:23.382 --> 24:28.082
- Nothing, I've figured it out.

24:31.958 --> 24:34.319
Alright.

24:34.320 --> 24:35.807
I'll be on my cell,
if you need me.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.918
I fly D.C... tomorrow.
Will be back tomorrow night.

24:37.919 --> 24:38.919
Okay.

24:38.920 --> 24:39.920
I'll work on the

24:39.921 --> 24:44.621
Good man.

24:51.880 --> 24:54.439
Check the blogs,
if there's any chatter. Would you?

24:54.440 --> 24:56.099
- Chatter? What kind of chatter?

24:56.100 --> 24:58.399
I don't know.
Just see what they're talking about.

24:58.400 --> 25:00.159
Steven, are you still single?

25:00.160 --> 25:03.729
- I'm married to the campaign, Governor.

25:03.730 --> 25:05.258
Married to the campaign.
Good answer.

25:05.259 --> 25:07.367
Wall Street Journal has us number
holding steady...

25:07.368 --> 25:08.368
Pullman dropped a point.

25:08.369 --> 25:09.369
- Really?

25:09.370 --> 25:10.895
- When did they do that?
- I'm checking it out.

25:10.896 --> 25:13.754
Governor, The Wall Street Journal
numbers are in and Pullman's down a point.

25:13.755 --> 25:16.699
- We are moving in a right direction.

25:16.700 --> 25:18.369
Ben, are you still single?

25:18.370 --> 25:19.690
- Married to the campaign, Governor.

25:19.691 --> 25:21.699
Crack team.

25:21.700 --> 25:26.400
Make sure Charlie Ross has
those numbers before he goes on.

25:27.490 --> 25:30.509
Get a copy of the show
before we leave too.

25:30.510 --> 25:32.829
Is it a difficult decision?
I have to believe it is.

25:32.830 --> 25:34.274
Would I do it?

25:34.275 --> 25:35.759
No. But...

25:35.760 --> 25:38.418
I can't see myself or anyone...
certainly not a government, telling a woman...

25:38.419 --> 25:40.644
what she should do with her body.

25:40.645 --> 25:43.359
So, you would appoint a Judge?
- We'd consider it arrogant...

25:43.360 --> 25:46.369
to judge anyone...
until I've walked in their shoes.

25:46.370 --> 25:47.860
- But you're against the death penalty?

25:47.861 --> 25:48.861
Mmhmm.

25:48.320 --> 25:50.905
Because of what it says about us,
as a society.

25:50.906 --> 25:52.938
- Suppose Governor,
It was your wife?

25:52.939 --> 25:53.939
- If she's murdered?

25:53.920 --> 25:55.579
What would I do?

25:55.580 --> 25:56.940
It gets more complicated
when it's personal.

25:56.941 --> 25:57.949
Sure.

25:57.950 --> 26:01.929
Well, If I could get to him.

26:01.930 --> 26:03.759
I would find a way to kill him.

26:03.760 --> 26:07.309
- So, You... you governor
would impose a death penalty?

26:07.310 --> 26:11.169
No, I would commit a crime,
for which I'd happily go to jail.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.875
- Then, why not
let the society, Do that?

26:13.876 --> 26:16.979
Because society, has to be better
than the individual.

26:16.980 --> 26:19.205
If I were to do that,
I would be wrong!

26:19.206 --> 26:20.206
- What about guns?

26:20.207 --> 26:21.207
Isn't it time for commercial?

26:21.208 --> 26:24.741
- This is a public television.
We don't have any commercial.

26:24.340 --> 26:25.805
That's unfortunate.

26:25.806 --> 26:28.209
Where did you go after Iowa?

26:28.210 --> 26:31.879
- California.
Super Tuesday.

26:31.880 --> 26:33.470
I had to got to New York.

26:33.471 --> 26:35.209
- I know.

26:35.210 --> 26:39.910
You guys need even a lot more help, over there.

26:42.820 --> 26:45.459
So, Why politics?

26:45.460 --> 26:48.939
- Because the pay is so good, obviously.

26:48.940 --> 26:51.314
It seems like a very odd...

26:51.315 --> 26:52.269
fit.

26:52.270 --> 26:56.970
My dad is Jack Stearns.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.339
He's a good guy.

26:59.340 --> 27:01.329
- He's an Asshole.

27:01.330 --> 27:03.809
But, he is your boss.

27:03.810 --> 27:07.529
He is not my boss.

27:07.530 --> 27:09.919
He is the head of The DMC.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.292
- You don't work for
The Democratic National Committee?

27:12.293 --> 27:13.999
No, I work for Paul.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.569
Paul work for Morris.
If Morris wins, He's gonna be your Dad's Boss.

27:18.570 --> 27:21.229
- Don't tell my dad that.

27:21.230 --> 27:23.319
I don't tell your dad, a lot of things.

27:23.320 --> 27:28.020
- Never.

27:29.860 --> 27:31.239
What time you got work tomorrow?

27:31.240 --> 27:34.646
- Nine A.M.

27:34.647 --> 27:37.839
I'm showing the new interns
how to rope all call.

27:37.840 --> 27:38.890
Cos I'm an experienced intern.

27:38.891 --> 27:42.619
You see?

27:42.620 --> 27:46.909
I see.

27:46.910 --> 27:49.589
How old are you?

27:49.590 --> 27:53.089
How old you think, I am?

27:53.090 --> 27:54.849
- Thirty.

27:54.850 --> 27:56.559
You think I'm Thirty?

27:56.560 --> 27:57.939
- I am Sorry,

27:57.940 --> 28:00.040
How old are you?

28:00.041 --> 28:04.741
Thirty.

28:05.180 --> 28:07.539
How old are you?

28:07.540 --> 28:11.559
- How old do you think, I am?

28:11.560 --> 28:12.670
Twenty-one?

28:12.671 --> 28:16.649
Twenty.

28:16.650 --> 28:21.350
That's young.

28:21.770 --> 28:26.470
- Is it too young to fuck a thirty year old?

28:27.250 --> 28:30.229
Well...

28:30.230 --> 28:32.909
You see, Laws are different in different States.

28:32.910 --> 28:34.399
Here...

28:34.400 --> 28:37.889
Your Hotel here in Kentucky,
It's frowned upon.

28:37.890 --> 28:39.089
But,

28:39.090 --> 28:41.830
We go across the bridge in Ohio?

28:41.831 --> 28:42.831
- Oh, where your hotel is.

28:42.560 --> 28:47.149
Yeah, surprisingly... they're very laxed
in their Child Endangerment Laws.

28:47.150 --> 28:49.089
- Do you have a car?
I don't drive.

28:49.090 --> 28:53.790
I took a cab.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.700
- I have the keys to the campaign bus.

29:02.701 --> 29:04.227
<i><font color="#804040">TV Reporter:</font>
It fairness this has been tried before.</i>

29:04.228 --> 29:06.803
<i>'Operation Chaos' as Russ Limbaugh called it.</i>

29:06.804 --> 29:09.345
<i>Where, Republicans voted for a Democrat...</i>

29:09.346 --> 29:11.676
<i>they thought they could beat
in the General Election.</i>

29:11.677 --> 29:14.287
<i>We asked Sen. Pullman's campaign manager...</i>

29:14.288 --> 29:17.047
<i>If he's happy the votes of Right-Wingers?</i>

29:17.048 --> 29:18.668
Is it decisive?

29:18.669 --> 29:19.966
No. Of course not.

29:19.967 --> 29:23.002
But look, we believe that
the polls are within the margin of error.

29:23.003 --> 29:25.749
And that the... uh Senator
will win Ohio.

29:25.750 --> 29:28.461
Yeah, What time is Paul getting in?

29:28.462 --> 29:29.379
Shit.

29:29.380 --> 29:31.909
Who do we talk to about polling?

29:31.910 --> 29:36.610
I gotta get some internal polling
at the independents and fucking wing nuts.

29:36.666 --> 29:37.516
- Do you want me to go?

29:37.517 --> 29:38.517
Wait.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.200
What's that guy's name
from The Wall Street Journal?

29:40.201 --> 29:41.329
- You sound busy, I should go.

29:41.330 --> 29:44.879
Can you hold on a second,
I'd like to talk to you about something.

29:44.880 --> 29:47.179
Adler? Yeah,
get him on the line.

29:47.180 --> 29:49.939
Nobody.
The cleaning lady.

29:49.940 --> 29:53.529
Get him on the line... and tell him
we're gonna take the same position we always sat.

29:53.530 --> 29:57.649
The race is a lot close than the polling.

29:57.650 --> 30:00.089
No, don't say that. Don't.

30:00.090 --> 30:02.439
Just get him on the line,
call me... and I'll take care of it.

30:02.440 --> 30:03.849
I'm sorry.

30:03.850 --> 30:05.510
- Cleaning Lady?

30:05.511 --> 30:07.009
Yeah.

30:07.010 --> 30:10.899
You called me the cleaning lady.

30:10.900 --> 30:12.549
You're not mad about that, are you?

30:12.550 --> 30:13.660
- No, why would I be mad?

30:13.661 --> 30:16.029
Alright.

30:16.030 --> 30:20.730
Oh hey! Look...

30:34.870 --> 30:36.658
Your dad is an asshole.

30:36.659 --> 30:39.009
- I'm gonna tell him,
you said that.

30:39.010 --> 30:41.359
Yeah, do that.

30:41.360 --> 30:43.519
You wanted to talk to me about something?

30:43.520 --> 30:46.679
Yeah, I just want it to be clear.
I don't want there to be any confusion.

30:46.680 --> 30:49.069
- I'm not gonna tell anybody
about last night.

30:49.070 --> 30:51.849
- That'll be great. If we kept it between us.
You know how people are.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.489
Yeah.

30:53.490 --> 30:57.159
Really wouldn't look good,
if you screwed an intern.

30:57.160 --> 30:59.969
It's not like that.

30:59.970 --> 31:01.961
It's not like I got drunk
and this happened. I like you.

31:01.962 --> 31:04.140
I just don't want there
to be any expectations, you know.

31:04.141 --> 31:05.909
- Steven, you don't have to say anything.

31:05.910 --> 31:08.059
Alright.

31:08.060 --> 31:10.009
I just don't
want you to think I'm a player.

31:10.010 --> 31:14.579
You're kind of a player.

31:14.580 --> 31:16.430
I was being polite.

31:16.431 --> 31:17.431
Bullshit.

31:17.320 --> 31:19.379
You were trying to pick me up.

31:19.380 --> 31:20.480
No, I wasn't.

31:20.481 --> 31:22.919
You're pretty obvious about it.

31:22.920 --> 31:23.850
I was?

31:23.851 --> 31:25.619
Yeah.

31:25.620 --> 31:27.261
I thought,
I was being smooth and subtle.

31:27.262 --> 31:29.699
No, you are pretty forward.

31:29.700 --> 31:31.689
You are pretty forward.
Asking me in a bar.

31:31.690 --> 31:32.939
Well,

31:32.940 --> 31:36.719
I've been trying to fuck you
for a while.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.119
Wow!

31:39.120 --> 31:40.834
It's kinda slutty of me, huh?

31:40.835 --> 31:42.099
I don't know.

31:42.100 --> 31:43.630
I respected it in a strange way.

31:43.631 --> 31:47.589
Good.

31:47.590 --> 31:49.810
You have absolutely no idea,
how to tie a tie are you?

31:49.811 --> 31:53.569
No, no... I don't have a clue.

31:53.570 --> 31:56.399
You're very mature.

31:56.400 --> 32:01.100
- For a teenager.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.878
When are you coming back?

32:03.879 --> 32:05.899
- I'll be at the event, a little late.

32:05.900 --> 32:08.497
These cocksuckers...
fucking dirty shit!

32:08.498 --> 32:10.471
What happened with Thompson?

32:10.472 --> 32:11.472
- Nothing!

32:11.473 --> 32:14.040
Prick...

32:14.041 --> 32:15.275
sold out motherfucker.

32:15.276 --> 32:19.976
How bad is it?

32:20.328 --> 32:22.098
I don't know.

32:22.099 --> 32:24.261
I just... I'm running the numbers, Paul.

32:24.262 --> 32:27.027
- Alright, I'll be there in three hours.

32:27.028 --> 32:30.097
I want hard numbers...
and the strategies.

32:30.098 --> 32:31.098
Yeah, I'm on it.

32:31.099 --> 32:35.799
I gotta go.

32:45.790 --> 32:47.173
You, okay?

32:47.174 --> 32:49.912
Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out,
how it stops in the mind.

32:49.913 --> 32:51.289
- The weather will determind that.

32:51.290 --> 32:53.349
If we get there.

32:53.350 --> 32:55.919
- We're gonna be fine.

32:55.920 --> 32:57.476
We have to do it and...

32:57.477 --> 32:58.477
It's the right thing to do.

32:58.478 --> 33:01.549
And nothing bad happens
when you're doing the right thing.

33:01.550 --> 33:05.229
Is this your personal theory?
Cos I can shoot holes in it.

33:05.230 --> 33:07.719
Roberta Clemedia on a humanitarian flight.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.399
- Well, there is...

33:09.400 --> 33:14.100
There's exceptions to every rule.

33:14.120 --> 33:17.109
So, how are you doing?

33:17.110 --> 33:19.099
- I think, we are fine now.

33:19.100 --> 33:22.379
No, the campaign.
How are we doing?

33:22.380 --> 33:25.499
- Oh, Great.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.271
Steven, you are not Paul.

33:27.272 --> 33:28.272
I pay Paul, to use the word 'Great',

33:28.273 --> 33:31.589
I pay you to tell me the truth.

33:31.590 --> 33:35.529
- I think that we are solid.

33:35.530 --> 33:39.469
Okay, Paul.

33:39.470 --> 33:42.669
- Governor, there's a big difference
between Paul and Me.

33:42.670 --> 33:46.309
Paul only believes in winning.
So, he'll do or say anything, to win.

33:46.310 --> 33:48.019
But, You wouldn't?

33:48.020 --> 33:50.579
I'll do or say anything,
to what I believe it in.

33:50.580 --> 33:54.369
But, I have to believe in the cause.

33:54.370 --> 33:58.419
Oh, you'll make a lousy consultant
when you're out on this line of work.

33:58.420 --> 34:01.939
- Well, I won't be out of work in this line,
as long as you are in it, Sir.

34:01.940 --> 34:04.629
So, at best you got eight years.

34:04.630 --> 34:08.339
And you'll end up with a nice little
consultant firm off Fairgate North.

34:08.340 --> 34:10.938
Making 750 grand a year
eating at The Palm...

34:10.940 --> 34:12.829
pimping out ex-senators to...

34:12.830 --> 34:14.899
Saudi Princess.

34:14.900 --> 34:18.329
- Pimping out ex-presidents.

34:18.330 --> 34:21.188
Well, I better win.

34:21.190 --> 34:24.259
- Yeah.

34:24.260 --> 34:25.759
Now, I've been married for...

34:25.760 --> 34:27.779
eleven years.

34:27.780 --> 34:30.168
We have a normal marriage.

34:30.170 --> 34:32.299
Which means,
When we disagree...

34:32.300 --> 34:36.469
She wins.

34:36.469 --> 34:40.719
But, what we never disagree on is,
How we're gonna leave this planet for our daughter.

34:40.719 --> 34:42.239
Are we gonna leave it,
Better off...

34:42.239 --> 34:44.728
or worse.

34:44.730 --> 34:47.859
The riches people in this country,
don't pay their fair share.

34:47.860 --> 34:51.359
And when they're asked to,
they cry socialism,

34:51.360 --> 34:55.958
they use phrases like,
'redistribution of wealth'.

34:55.960 --> 35:00.079
That scares everybody
and they all run and they hide.

35:00.080 --> 35:02.059
For the record,

35:02.060 --> 35:06.765
My campaign is vehemently
against the distribution of wealth,

35:06.766 --> 35:09.485
to the riches Americans by our government!

35:09.486 --> 35:14.186
And I will run on that.

35:24.220 --> 35:28.775
I met with Tom Duffy, yesterday.

35:28.776 --> 35:30.119
- What?

35:30.120 --> 35:32.049
You were on the plane,
when he called me.

35:32.050 --> 35:34.227
And he asked, if we can meet.
I said, Why?

35:34.228 --> 35:37.149
He said, it was very important.
And so, I did.

35:37.150 --> 35:39.898
And I should've fucking told you. I'm sorry.
- Stop! Stop!

35:39.899 --> 35:42.003
Let me get this straight.
You met with Tom Duffy?

35:42.004 --> 35:43.609
Yeah.

35:43.610 --> 35:46.449
What did he want, Steven?

35:46.450 --> 35:48.092
The gist, he wants to hire me.

35:48.093 --> 35:50.043
He wants me to jump ship and
come and work for him.

35:50.044 --> 35:51.437
This is really fucking bad.

35:51.438 --> 35:52.438
He told me that they had poll numbers,

35:52.410 --> 35:54.231
that had Pullman ahead by four.

35:54.232 --> 35:57.589
And the big fucking trouble is
he laid out their strategy...

35:57.590 --> 36:01.599
rob all calls, traffic jam,
fake leave and Thompson.

36:01.600 --> 36:04.619
They offered Thompson,
Secretary of State.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.569
You know,
How you fight the war on terror?

36:06.570 --> 36:10.004
You don't need their product anymore,
their product is oil,

36:10.005 --> 36:14.705
Just don't need it
and they go away!

36:14.847 --> 36:16.075
We don't have to bomb anyone,

36:16.076 --> 36:20.776
We don't have to
invade anyone!

36:21.327 --> 36:23.849
If this is some kind of
fucking practical... I mean...

36:23.850 --> 36:27.441
My fucking blood pressure is going
through the god damn roof, right now.

36:27.442 --> 36:30.589
- Paul, I'm sorry.

36:30.590 --> 36:34.029
Believe me.

36:34.030 --> 36:36.661
I just didn't think it was true.
- It doesn't matter what you fucking thought!

36:36.662 --> 36:40.339
It matters what you did
and it matters, what you didn't do!

36:40.340 --> 36:44.390
Because if all this shit is true?
I made a fucking ass out of myself in Thompson's place...

36:44.391 --> 36:45.699
And I gave away our game plan.

36:45.700 --> 36:48.580
- Please believe me that,
I honestly believed that you're gonna come back,

36:48.581 --> 36:50.554
And you were gonna tell me that
we have Thompson in the bag.

36:50.555 --> 36:51.959
I didn't see the point.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.899
It doesn't make it right,
and I am sorry!

36:53.900 --> 36:57.439
Let me think.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.599
Let me think.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.679
If I am your President...

37:01.680 --> 37:05.929
the first thing I'd put in motion is
ten years from the day I take office...

37:05.930 --> 37:10.630
No new car in America is run on
an internal combustion engine.

37:13.016 --> 37:16.620
We will create hundreds of thousands
of new jobs. We will start...

37:16.621 --> 37:18.914
the next technological revolution.

37:18.915 --> 37:21.222
And we will lead the world again!

37:21.223 --> 37:25.419
Like we used to.

37:25.420 --> 37:28.335
We get the governor
right after he finishes singing kumbayah,

37:28.336 --> 37:31.179
and we give him everything we know.

37:31.180 --> 37:32.985
- Who do you want?
- You, Me and The Governor.

37:32.986 --> 37:34.409
That's it!

37:34.410 --> 37:36.429
What's he have, after?

37:36.430 --> 37:38.209
- He has a fund raiser...
- We'll be late.

37:38.210 --> 37:41.249
We are gonna tell him that
if he doesn't offer Thompson the Cabinet position...

37:41.250 --> 37:43.089
He's not gonna get the nomination.

37:43.090 --> 37:44.188
- And he's gonna go for it?

37:44.189 --> 37:47.049
Fucking no, Steven.

37:47.050 --> 37:51.750
Find us a room.

38:38.140 --> 38:41.579
How do we look at the numbers?

38:41.580 --> 38:43.990
We might pick up a few points,
but we loose by 3 or 4 percent.

38:43.991 --> 38:45.309
- Who the fucking knows, governor?

38:45.310 --> 38:46.769
But we can't take the chance.

38:46.770 --> 38:48.779
What do you think?

38:48.780 --> 38:51.008
I think we follow up the campaign in Ohio.

38:51.009 --> 38:54.789
Take a loss, while the republicans
are playing games, head to North Carolina.

38:54.790 --> 38:56.854
I can't run from Ohio,
they'd kill us.

38:56.855 --> 38:58.699
- Not if you get Thompson's endorsement.

38:58.700 --> 39:00.526
I'm not gonna do it.
What does he want?

39:00.527 --> 39:02.469
The FDA or something?

39:02.470 --> 39:03.971
- A Cabinet post.

39:03.972 --> 39:05.348
Yeah, what labour?

39:05.349 --> 39:08.559
- State.

39:08.560 --> 39:09.794
Are you fucking kidding me?

39:09.795 --> 39:14.495
I'm gonna give Sec. Of State to a guy who wants
to cut the top ten floors off the U.N?

39:14.670 --> 39:18.085
Paul, when we started this campaign,
I said I wasn't gonna make those kind of deals...

39:18.086 --> 39:20.869
- Gov. If we loose Ohio and they get
Thompson's delegates...

39:20.870 --> 39:25.089
Then they get North Carolina,
Then, they get the lead!

39:25.090 --> 39:27.569
A lead we can't beat.

39:27.570 --> 39:30.679
But if we walk from Ohio...
take Thompson, give him the fucking cabinet post

39:30.680 --> 39:32.629
then we take North Carolina,

39:32.630 --> 39:35.179
His state. Then, Pennsylvania...
your state...

39:35.180 --> 39:36.300
and then, it's simple math...

39:36.301 --> 39:38.519
Mike.

39:38.520 --> 39:43.220
Take his endorsement and the race is over.

39:44.770 --> 39:48.329
Paul, I respect you.

39:48.330 --> 39:51.399
I respect your opinion.

39:51.400 --> 39:55.349
I'm never gonna do it.

39:55.350 --> 40:00.050
So, I suggest...
we find a way for me to win Ohio.

40:01.880 --> 40:03.839
Anything else?

40:03.840 --> 40:08.229
It's not gonna cut it.
I need to send it.

40:08.230 --> 40:10.289
Fuck... Jess,
I gotta call you back.

40:10.290 --> 40:11.710
- All of them?
- All of them.

40:11.711 --> 40:12.899
It's killing me!

40:12.900 --> 40:14.322
Here's what I got so far.

40:14.323 --> 40:16.889
Independent's aren't biting
what the republicans are.

40:16.890 --> 40:20.487
They're not gonna tell polls
to the devoting Democratics.

40:20.488 --> 40:23.034
- Alright, I also made a call
and I'm gonna get a 100 vans...

40:23.035 --> 40:24.035
out of Covington
and Newport, Kentucky.

40:24.036 --> 40:27.979
We don't need the fucking vans.

40:27.980 --> 40:32.680
We were the under-dog before we got into this,
and we continue to be the underdog.

40:33.210 --> 40:37.910
Well then... yeah, we always knew the number's
gonna get closer to closer as it get to tuesday.

40:38.320 --> 40:43.020
We're not lowering expectations,
have I ever said to you that we had Ohio locked?

40:43.930 --> 40:48.630
Well then, at least give me the courtesy
of printing that in the column.

40:50.780 --> 40:53.459
What are you writing?

40:53.460 --> 40:56.329
- The greatest speech ever given
on hydrogen power.

40:56.330 --> 40:58.580
The bar is set awefully high on that one.

40:58.581 --> 41:02.859
I know it.

41:02.860 --> 41:05.729
I was hit up by Mitchel's wife,

41:05.730 --> 41:09.280
for you to show up at her
Daughters of the American Revolution lucheon.

41:09.281 --> 41:11.759
- Who's Mitchel?

41:11.760 --> 41:14.659
Congressman from the first district.

41:14.660 --> 41:16.799
You might wanna remember that.

41:16.800 --> 41:19.339
- Fucking congressman.

41:19.340 --> 41:21.640
Can you imagine doing this
every two years?

41:21.641 --> 41:24.369
No, I can't.

41:24.370 --> 41:26.849
Let's just do it, one more time.

41:26.850 --> 41:28.174
And four more years.

41:28.175 --> 41:29.175
That's it.

41:29.176 --> 41:33.876
- That's a deal.

41:35.010 --> 41:39.089
Do you think we'd loose Ohio?

41:39.090 --> 41:41.699
- I don't know.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.609
If you took Thompson's delegates.

41:43.610 --> 41:45.529
The race would be over.

41:45.530 --> 41:50.029
Ohio wouldn't matter.

41:50.030 --> 41:53.289
- Is Paul working on you?

41:53.290 --> 41:56.789
Steven.

41:56.790 --> 42:01.490
- They're good.

42:02.310 --> 42:04.429
Is Thompson so bad?

42:04.430 --> 42:05.684
- He is a shit.

42:05.685 --> 42:07.479
Is he worse than Pullman?

42:07.480 --> 42:12.180
- Yes, Steven.

42:18.110 --> 42:19.280
I will tell them,
I am gonna draw a line on the sand,

42:19.281 --> 42:20.829
then denial.

42:20.830 --> 42:24.329
I'm gonna move it.

42:24.330 --> 42:27.339
Fund raiser, union deals...
I will do any of it.

42:27.340 --> 42:29.839
Negative ads??

42:29.840 --> 42:33.163
I can't on this one,

42:33.164 --> 42:37.864
Not, Thompson.

42:40.463 --> 42:44.619
Tell Mrs. Mitchel,
I'll make her God damn luncheon.

42:44.620 --> 42:48.159
All they'll do is pat me on the head.

42:48.160 --> 42:52.860
- You've got great hair.

42:53.250 --> 42:54.589
Gay marriage?

42:54.590 --> 42:56.399
- It's a silly argument.

42:56.400 --> 42:58.079
Not to fifty percent of Americans.

42:58.080 --> 42:59.080
- Over the age of fifty.

42:59.081 --> 43:00.081
That's who votes...

43:00.082 --> 43:01.878
That's who shows up at the polls.

43:01.879 --> 43:02.879
- Well, that's changed.

43:02.880 --> 43:07.580
And hopefully, the way we frame
the argument is as well.

43:08.910 --> 43:10.599
But one can argue a great difference...

43:10.600 --> 43:12.299
Between, gender and race.

43:12.300 --> 43:15.679
- Not really. We used to ban
inter-racial marriages, women couldn't vote...

43:15.680 --> 43:16.909
Paul,

43:16.910 --> 43:18.148
the guy from Procter and Gamble.

43:18.149 --> 43:19.149
- Keep an eye on the governor.

43:19.150 --> 43:20.150
Okay.

43:20.151 --> 43:22.729
I don't know what's going on there.

43:22.730 --> 43:26.386
Wait, wait... wait.
She's got a point to make.

43:26.387 --> 43:27.387
That's okay, go ahead.

43:27.388 --> 43:31.563
The argument is that man and women
can in fact be considered separate but equal...

43:31.564 --> 43:32.564
races cannot.

43:32.565 --> 43:33.565
- How so?

43:33.550 --> 43:36.258
We have separate public bathrooms
for both man and women.

43:36.259 --> 43:39.220
But, it will be illegal
to have separate bathrooms for two races.

43:39.221 --> 43:40.221
Now...

43:40.222 --> 43:44.380
Yes, now.

43:44.381 --> 43:45.740
What time's this hearing?

43:45.741 --> 43:48.030
- Nine O'clock.
- How're we doing?

43:48.031 --> 43:52.731
We're doing good.

45:40.522 --> 45:42.429
Hey, your phone rang.

45:42.430 --> 45:46.459
Your phone rang.

45:46.460 --> 45:49.478
Who's calling you at 2:30 in the morning?

45:49.479 --> 45:51.009
- I don't know.

45:51.010 --> 45:53.349
Hmm? He asked you by name.

45:53.350 --> 45:55.260
- You answered it?

45:55.261 --> 45:57.079
I thought, it was my phone.

45:57.080 --> 45:59.713
Who's it?

45:59.714 --> 46:02.019
- I don't know.

46:02.020 --> 46:05.251
Is it one of those interns,
drunk dialing it?

46:05.252 --> 46:07.699
- No, that never happens.

46:07.700 --> 46:09.010
Let me see the number.

46:09.011 --> 46:10.011
Ohh, boy!

46:10.012 --> 46:11.012
I can't believe it.

46:09.540 --> 46:13.014
No... I'm calling him.
- Steven, stop! It's not funny.

46:13.015 --> 46:14.015
I'm saying, I'm your dad.
- Steven, it's not funny,

46:14.016 --> 46:15.359
give me my phone.

46:15.360 --> 46:16.484
Hang up.

46:16.485 --> 46:21.185
Steven, hang up the phone!

46:37.880 --> 46:42.580
Why is the governor calling you,
at 2:30 in the morning?

46:45.379 --> 46:49.389
Molly?

46:49.390 --> 46:54.090
Why is the governor calling you, at all?

46:54.913 --> 46:59.479
- I'm in trouble.

46:59.480 --> 47:02.449
With the governor?

47:02.450 --> 47:07.150
What's going on?

47:08.790 --> 47:13.490
- I was working on the campaign in Iowa,

47:14.040 --> 47:17.379
there was a party in Ben's room,
after the rally party in Des Moines.

47:17.380 --> 47:19.329
There's a party, with You and Ben...

47:19.330 --> 47:22.005
and the governor?

47:22.006 --> 47:23.210
- No, he wasn't there.

47:23.211 --> 47:27.069
Where was he?

47:27.070 --> 47:31.770
- I took him up a hard copy
of the polling numbers.

47:32.216 --> 47:35.016
After the party?

47:35.017 --> 47:39.069
- It was around mid-night.

47:39.070 --> 47:42.515
I just stood,
in the doorway with him.

47:42.516 --> 47:47.216
Just... talking-
for a really long time.

47:50.136 --> 47:54.836
He just reached behind me
and closed the door.

47:59.681 --> 48:04.381
Jesus 'fucking' Christ!

48:11.850 --> 48:15.060
Were you drunk?

48:15.061 --> 48:17.419
- Not that drunk.

48:17.420 --> 48:19.710
How many times?

48:19.711 --> 48:20.739
- It was just that once.

48:20.740 --> 48:22.156
Does anybody know?

48:22.157 --> 48:23.157
- No one knows.

48:23.158 --> 48:24.158
Did anybody see you?
- No!

48:24.159 --> 48:25.159
How can you know?

48:25.160 --> 48:26.160
I know!

48:26.161 --> 48:27.459
Then, why's he calling you right now?

48:27.460 --> 48:30.880
- I called him first.

48:30.881 --> 48:31.506
Why?

48:31.507 --> 48:34.509
- Because I didn't know,
who else to go to.

48:34.510 --> 48:39.210
And I needed nine-hundred bucks.

48:40.080 --> 48:43.323
For what?

48:43.324 --> 48:48.024
- I can't go to my dad.

48:48.829 --> 48:53.529
We are Catholic.

49:00.794 --> 49:04.304
So... what should I do?

49:04.305 --> 49:09.005
Steven?

50:30.288 --> 50:34.988
What's up?

50:36.280 --> 50:38.579
What's our limit on petty cash?

50:38.580 --> 50:39.540
- It's about five-hundred.

50:39.541 --> 50:40.541
Why?

50:40.542 --> 50:41.939
I need everything we can get.

50:41.940 --> 50:44.119
Is everythign okay?

50:44.120 --> 50:45.989
You need help with anything?

50:45.990 --> 50:47.430
- Yeah, don't put it in the books.

50:47.431 --> 50:52.131
That's all.

50:52.580 --> 50:54.688
- Ohh, what should I put in down instead?

50:54.689 --> 50:55.769
Don't put it down, that's it.

50:55.770 --> 50:58.000
Okay, anything above hundred,
I gotta put it down...

50:58.001 --> 51:02.039
- Just do it!

51:02.040 --> 51:06.740
Molly?

51:27.533 --> 51:29.559
<i>'Meet me at the stairwell, at noon'</i>

51:29.560 --> 51:32.863
Okay.

51:32.864 --> 51:37.564
I'll take that back.

52:02.360 --> 52:03.879
Yes, Ida?

52:03.880 --> 52:06.715
<i>- Stevie, off the record.</i>

52:06.716 --> 52:09.549
No, I cannot tell you,
what happened in North Carolina.

52:09.550 --> 52:12.329
<i>- That's not what I wanted to ask you about.</i>

52:12.330 --> 52:14.281
Okay, what?

52:14.282 --> 52:18.982
<i>- You met with Duffy.</i>

52:19.584 --> 52:20.565
Who told you that?

52:20.566 --> 52:23.381
<i>- A little bird.</i>

52:23.382 --> 52:24.364
WHO?

52:24.365 --> 52:27.249
<i>- Did you meet with him?</i>

52:27.250 --> 52:29.809
Where are you?

52:29.810 --> 52:32.742
I know that you met with him in a little bar
in Cinci. Two days ago...

52:32.743 --> 52:34.059
just before the press conference.

52:34.060 --> 52:36.089
Duffy ordered buffalo wings.

52:36.090 --> 52:37.338
Who said that? Duffy?

52:37.339 --> 52:38.339
- Annonymous.

52:37.980 --> 52:39.849
What happened with Duffy?

52:39.850 --> 52:41.733
Ida, you're supposed to be my friend...

52:41.734 --> 52:44.336
Why'd you wanna stickthe fucking knife
at me, on a bullshit story?

52:44.337 --> 52:45.599
- Is that what you thought,
that we are friends?

52:45.600 --> 52:47.304
I've given you
anything you've ever wanted.

52:47.305 --> 52:48.305
Everything. Every story... every scoop...

52:48.306 --> 52:50.599
You're entire profile with Paul.
- You're right, you've given me a lot.

52:50.600 --> 52:51.885
But, let's get real here Steve.

52:51.886 --> 52:54.241
The only reason you've ever
treated me well was that I work for The Times.

52:54.242 --> 52:55.819
Not because I'm your friend.

52:55.820 --> 52:57.805
You give me what I want...
I write you better stories.

52:57.806 --> 52:59.409
Don't pretend,
it's any more than that.

52:59.410 --> 53:01.389
Why did you meet with Duffy?

53:01.390 --> 53:02.640
- Go fuck yourself!

53:02.641 --> 53:04.501
Okay... I'll make it easier on you,
forget Duffy.

53:04.502 --> 53:06.983
What happened in
Paul and Thompson's meeting?

53:06.984 --> 53:09.449
- Would you keep your voice down?

53:09.450 --> 53:11.189
Do you have any idea,
what this could do to me?

53:11.190 --> 53:13.230
Of course, I do.
That's why I'm giving you a choice, here.

53:13.231 --> 53:15.929
- I could get fired.

53:15.930 --> 53:18.009
So, it's not a difficult one, Is it?

53:18.010 --> 53:19.945
I've gotta file my three pm, tomorrow.

53:19.946 --> 53:24.646
You've got till then,
to make up your mind.

53:24.860 --> 53:26.440
You motherfucker!

53:26.441 --> 53:27.441
<i>- Excuse me?</i>

53:27.360 --> 53:29.160
You leaked it.

53:29.161 --> 53:30.161
<i>- Leaked, what?</i>

53:30.162 --> 53:32.299
Don't bullshit me, Tom.

53:32.300 --> 53:34.923
<i>- Bullshit you?
I have no idea what you're talking about.</i>

53:34.924 --> 53:35.924
I just spoke to Ida Horowicz.

53:35.925 --> 53:37.339
<i>- Yeah?</i>

53:37.340 --> 53:40.051
She's treatening to release the story.

53:40.052 --> 53:41.083
<i>- What fucking story?</i>

53:41.084 --> 53:42.084
That we met.

53:42.085 --> 53:43.085
That we fucking met!

53:43.086 --> 53:44.086
<i>- How did she find out?</i>

53:44.087 --> 53:47.219
Don't... play dumb, Tom.

53:47.220 --> 53:48.690
<i>- You think, I leaked it to her?</i>

53:48.691 --> 53:49.691
Yeah, who else?

53:49.190 --> 53:51.619
<i>- You know what?
I didn't leaked it to her, Steve.</i>

53:51.620 --> 53:53.232
Well, I know I didn't.
So, that leaves you.

53:53.233 --> 53:54.233
<i>- Okay.</i>

53:54.234 --> 53:55.234
<i>What, what does she know?</i>

53:55.235 --> 53:57.469
She knows whatever you told her.

53:57.470 --> 54:00.484
<i>- I swear to Jesus,
I did not leaked it to her, Steve.</i>

54:00.485 --> 54:02.565
<i>I don't want the story out
anymore than you do.</i>

54:02.566 --> 54:04.802
Well, too late!

54:04.803 --> 54:06.279
<i>- What did she tell you?</i>

54:06.280 --> 54:07.692
She know where we met,

54:07.693 --> 54:08.693
she knows, when we met.

54:08.694 --> 54:11.291
She knows, you had
fucking buffalo wings...

54:11.292 --> 54:12.292
<i>- She has a source?</i>

54:12.250 --> 54:13.760
Yeah, she has a source.

54:13.761 --> 54:16.029
<i>- And, you have no idea,
Who it could be?</i>

54:16.030 --> 54:18.860
Yeah, You!

54:18.861 --> 54:19.745
<i>- Well, for the record.</i>

54:19.746 --> 54:22.712
<i>It was not me...
and I didn't have fucking buffalo wings!</i>

54:22.713 --> 54:24.579
<i>So, it's gotta be someone else.</i>

54:24.580 --> 54:25.580
Did you tell anyone?

54:25.581 --> 54:26.581
<i>- No. Did you?</i>

54:26.490 --> 54:29.339
No.

54:29.340 --> 54:30.164
<i>- Did you admit to meeting with me?</i>

54:30.165 --> 54:31.165
No.

54:31.166 --> 54:32.166
<i>- Alright.</i>

54:32.167 --> 54:35.309
<i>Then, we stonewall her,
and she's got nothing.</i>

54:35.310 --> 54:37.830
She's gonna take this story to Drudge
or to RollCall...

54:37.831 --> 54:38.831
or to some shit like that.

54:38.820 --> 54:39.980
<i>- You can't stop her?</i>

54:39.981 --> 54:44.439
She's trying to blackmail me.
She wants info about Thompson.

54:44.440 --> 54:47.169
<i>- Well then tell her,
what she wants to know.</i>

54:47.170 --> 54:49.049
I can't do that.

54:49.050 --> 54:50.710
<i>- You can't let this story get out.</i>

54:50.711 --> 54:52.349
I'm not gonna be blackmailed, Tom.

54:52.350 --> 54:54.669
<i>- You don't have much choice here, Steve.</i>

54:54.670 --> 54:56.979
If I tell her about Thompson...

54:56.980 --> 54:58.772
I'm gonna have to tell her that,
he's endorsing you.

54:58.773 --> 54:59.773
<i>- Well, then tell her.</i>

54:59.774 --> 55:02.150
<i>I can handle it from my side,
if I start getting calls.</i>

55:02.151 --> 55:03.799
No fucking way!

55:03.800 --> 55:07.159
Paul told her we had Thompson in the bag,
It's gonna make him look like a fucking fool!

55:07.160 --> 55:08.160
<i>- He's gonna look like a fucking fool, anyway.</i>

55:08.161 --> 55:12.861
<i>When Thompson endorses us.</i>

55:17.653 --> 55:18.577
I can't do it.

55:18.578 --> 55:21.771
<i>- You know,
you're on a sinking ship, Steve.</i>

55:21.772 --> 55:22.772
<i>Tell her what she wants to know.</i>

55:22.773 --> 55:23.773
<i>And jump.</i>

55:23.774 --> 55:24.774
<i>Come over to our side.</i>

55:24.775 --> 55:28.039
<i>We can control this thing,</i>

55:28.040 --> 55:32.740
<i>Steve.
- I gotta go.</i>

56:02.290 --> 56:05.069
It's almost, eighteen hundred bucks.

56:05.070 --> 56:06.509
You gotta make the appoinment now.

56:06.510 --> 56:07.949
Like, today.

56:07.950 --> 56:10.119
From a pay-phone.

56:10.120 --> 56:12.085
I'll take you to the clinic,
and I'll pick you up.

56:12.086 --> 56:13.259
But, no one else.

56:13.260 --> 56:14.360
Do you understand?

56:14.361 --> 56:18.899
- Yeah.

56:18.900 --> 56:21.769
Take the rest of the money
and buy yourself a ticket home.

56:21.770 --> 56:24.129
You can't be here, anymore.
We can't afford it.

56:24.130 --> 56:28.795
Not with anything,
that's gonna happen next week.

56:28.796 --> 56:33.496
And the situation,
just can't be here.

56:33.650 --> 56:35.489
- You mean,
I can't be here?

56:35.490 --> 56:38.649
Right.

56:38.650 --> 56:42.109
- Steven, I wouldn't tell anyone.

56:42.110 --> 56:44.580
I hope not.

56:44.581 --> 56:46.549
- Then, Why?

56:46.550 --> 56:49.546
Because, you fucked up.

56:49.547 --> 56:50.807
- You and I both fucked up.

56:50.808 --> 56:52.039
That's true.

56:52.040 --> 56:55.149
But, I have a responsibily to him.
And more importantly,

56:55.150 --> 56:57.039
I have a responsibilty to this campaign.

56:57.040 --> 56:59.374
- I can go to North Carolina
and work on the campaign.

56:59.375 --> 57:00.833
Molly, you gotta wake the fuck up!

57:00.834 --> 57:01.834
This is the big leagues.

57:01.835 --> 57:03.349
It's mean.

57:03.350 --> 57:07.769
When you make a mistake,
you loose the right to play.

57:07.770 --> 57:09.549
Make the appoinment.

57:09.550 --> 57:14.250
Tell me, when and where
we have to go.

57:15.550 --> 57:16.764
Listen to this...

57:16.765 --> 57:18.520
I got the placement in The Times,

57:18.521 --> 57:19.521
Bumped to like 600 fucking articles...

57:19.522 --> 57:22.059
Tom Duffy, 2008.

57:22.060 --> 57:24.889
<i>' This is a match up between,
Hope Versus Fear.</i>

57:24.890 --> 57:28.399
<i>Nine times out of ten,
the feared candidate have to be the most experienced.</i>

57:28.400 --> 57:31.261
<i>'But in our presidential races,
the least experienced candidates...</i>

57:31.262 --> 57:32.262
<i>almost always wins.'</i>

57:32.263 --> 57:33.263
<i>JFK v/s Nixon.</i>

57:33.264 --> 57:34.264
<i>Carter v/s Ford</i>

57:34.265 --> 57:35.265
<i>Bush v/s Gore</i>

57:35.266 --> 57:39.668
<i>I like our chances
with the new kid on the block'.</i>

57:39.669 --> 57:41.019
- Thomas fucking Duffy.

57:41.020 --> 57:45.720
He's gotta be having a stroke right now.

59:18.919 --> 59:22.309
I hate this shit.

59:22.310 --> 59:26.250
I'm gonna come back
and this is all gonna be over.

59:26.251 --> 59:30.951
- Yeah?

59:46.160 --> 59:50.809
We gotta take a broader stroke here.

59:50.810 --> 59:54.799
Re-think everything.

59:54.800 --> 59:58.889
Yeah, I know how to handle it.

59:58.890 --> 01:00:00.644
Look, Stevie just got here.

01:00:00.645 --> 01:00:03.409
Can I call you back,
in a few minutes?

01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:04.595
Okay, Bye.

01:00:04.596 --> 01:00:05.596
The governor...

01:00:05.597 --> 01:00:08.319
we had a good long talk
on the way back.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.989
He's up to speed with everything.

01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:13.739
How did he take it?

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:16.179
- Better than I thought he would.

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:20.059
Still won't take Thompson's endorsement.

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:22.985
Paul, I gotta tell you something,
I don't know how to tell you.

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:26.329
- Huh... what's up?

01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:31.030
Ida knows that I met with Duffy.

01:00:34.877 --> 01:00:38.646
I don't know, How she knows.
But, she knows.

01:00:38.647 --> 01:00:43.347
She tried, to blackmaile me.

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:47.282
She said, she's gonna release the story,
Unless I tell her all the details,

01:00:47.283 --> 01:00:51.983
about your meeting with
Thompson.

01:00:53.590 --> 01:00:56.949
So, it's going to end at the papers?

01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:59.509
- Probably.

01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:02.761
And whoever she takes it to,
is gonna call me and ask for statement.

01:01:02.762 --> 01:01:05.056
If I deny the whole thing all together,

01:01:05.057 --> 01:01:07.292
but Duffy admits to it.
It's gonna look even worse,

01:01:07.293 --> 01:01:08.569
And if I just...

01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:13.270
say... No Comment.
They're not gonna let up.

01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:18.210
I... leaked it to Ida.

01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:27.670
At the event.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.749
- I don't understand.

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:34.450
We made a deal.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.029
Paul, they are gonna...

01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:41.350
they are gonna print that story
in the paper, tomorrow morning.

01:01:41.351 --> 01:01:43.639
I know.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.579
So, why'd you do it?

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:48.739
Why would you do that to the campaign?

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:53.440
The campaign will survive.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.029
- Why would you do that to me?

01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:59.389
Makes easier to let you go.

01:01:59.390 --> 01:02:01.539
- What?

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:06.240
Why did you meet with Duffy?

01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:09.160
- I made a Mistake.

01:02:09.161 --> 01:02:10.161
I made a stupid...

01:02:10.162 --> 01:02:11.449
No.

01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:12.310
...Mistake!

01:02:12.311 --> 01:02:15.669
No, Steven. You didn't make a mistake.
You made a choice!

01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:18.572
You called me and left a message
to call you back. That it was important.

01:02:18.573 --> 01:02:21.129
And when I did...
you told me to forget about it.

01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:22.479
You choose not to tell me.

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:23.799
Why did you made that choice?

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:26.507
- Because, Paul...
I didn't think it was important.

01:02:26.508 --> 01:02:29.819
Oh, Fuck Yes!
You did.

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:31.470
But, you won't...
B'cos you're curious.

01:02:31.471 --> 01:02:32.471
Because you felt flattered, special.

01:02:32.472 --> 01:02:33.472
Because...

01:02:32.890 --> 01:02:36.209
you felt, special!

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:40.349
To think that, Duffy wants to speak to you,
Instead of me.

01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:42.840
Because, you thought to yourself...
Maybe, I can get something out of this.

01:02:42.841 --> 01:02:47.541
Because... b'cos it made you feel 'Big'?

01:02:49.989 --> 01:02:50.588
You know...

01:02:50.589 --> 01:02:53.999
The first campaign I ran,
was a tiny little race in Kentucky.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.199
Uh, state senate seat... you know,
working for some red-neck nobody named...

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.699
Sam McGuffry.

01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:03.429
No staff. No money.
No fucking office.

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:05.419
Everyone thought,
we didn't stand a chance.

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:07.139
No way, we can compete, right?

01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.020
And about this time... This guy,

01:03:09.021 --> 01:03:12.469
running this congressional campaign,
a few district over... gives me a call.

01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:17.049
And he says, "I really liked
what you're able to do for poor old Sam."

01:03:17.050 --> 01:03:19.889
"But, let's face it. He's goner.
Why don't you come and work for me"?

01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:21.769
What did I do?

01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:23.419
Well, Steven...

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:24.981
This is where,
You and I are different.

01:03:24.982 --> 01:03:27.109
I told Sam, about the call.

01:03:27.110 --> 01:03:29.269
"And Sam says to me..." Paul,

01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:31.466
If you think this,
other guys got a chance of winning...

01:03:31.467 --> 01:03:33.260
and if he can pay you
more than any I can afford...

01:03:33.261 --> 01:03:34.269
and if it's what you feel...

01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:37.124
"You need to do.
Then, I won't get in your way."

01:03:37.125 --> 01:03:38.125
And I say,
"Sam, you took a chance on me,

01:03:38.126 --> 01:03:42.826
and hired me when I was even
more of a nobody than you are".

01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:46.510
So, I'll be damned...
If I was gonna jump ship.

01:03:46.511 --> 01:03:49.559
Just because, the shit hits the fan.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.464
We lost that race.

01:03:51.465 --> 01:03:53.840
But three years later,
When Sam decided to run for Governor...

01:03:53.841 --> 01:03:55.649
Who do you think, he called?

01:03:55.650 --> 01:03:58.328
We won that race,
and 20 years later... I'm where I am.

01:03:58.329 --> 01:04:00.689
Fucking now!

01:04:00.690 --> 01:04:03.019
There's only one thing
I value in this world, Steven.

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:04.020
That's loyalty.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:06.209
And without it,
You're nothing!

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:09.269
And you have no one.

01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:11.169
And in politics?

01:04:11.170 --> 01:04:13.509
In fucking politics,

01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:16.629
It's the only currency
you can count on.

01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:19.149
That's why I'm letting you go.

01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:20.785
Not because, you're not good enough.

01:04:20.786 --> 01:04:21.786
Not because, I don't like you.

01:04:21.787 --> 01:04:23.959
But, I value trust over skill.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.239
I don't fucking trust you anymore.

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:29.839
- It doesn't matter whether you trust me, Paul.
It matters if what the governor does.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:32.129
The governor already knows!

01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:36.369
And he thinks,
it's the right thing to do.

01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:37.879
- He does?

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.684
Yeah, and you know what?

01:04:39.685 --> 01:04:40.685
If I were you...

01:04:40.686 --> 01:04:42.109
I'd get a good night sleep.

01:04:42.110 --> 01:04:46.810
B'cos, you're gonna get fucking
pounded by call from the press, in the morning.

01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:25.579
<font color="#804040">Ben:</font> Hey, where were you today?

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:27.509
- Uhm,

01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:30.219
I'm not feeling great today, Ben.

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:34.409
You picked a hell of a day,
to call in sick.

01:06:34.410 --> 01:06:35.800
Jesus, it's fucking wild ass there.

01:06:35.801 --> 01:06:37.429
- Why? What happened?

01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:40.579
Steven's off the campaign.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:43.059
Paul fired him,
some fucking set up about loyalty...

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:46.119
and it looks like, Steven might've been
doubling down with Duffy, on the Pullman campaign...

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:47.874
I was sitting in the room.

01:06:47.875 --> 01:06:50.945
When Paul told Steven that he's fired.
And Steven said, who's gonna take over...

01:06:50.946 --> 01:06:51.946
and Paul said, Me.

01:06:51.947 --> 01:06:52.947
I know.

01:06:52.948 --> 01:06:53.948
I know, I'm like...

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:58.175
easy there soldier. But then, Steven goes apeshit,
Paul's giving him speech about loyalty...

01:06:58.176 --> 01:07:00.599
and, and then, shits on Steven
like I've never seen before.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.070
Like humiliating shit.

01:07:02.071 --> 01:07:04.819
- When was this?

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.359
Molly, listen to me.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.809
I'm gonna run the campaign,
under Paul.

01:07:08.810 --> 01:07:12.659
Steven's going to Duffy,
I... I just jumped three years ahead.

01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:14.974
So, starting tomorrow morning...

01:07:14.975 --> 01:07:17.489
we go into full damage control.

01:07:17.490 --> 01:07:18.631
And I'm telling you...

01:07:18.632 --> 01:07:19.709
Steven's going apeshit.

01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:22.247
He said, he's taking everybody down
his way out.

01:07:22.248 --> 01:07:25.600
Morris... Everybody!

01:07:25.601 --> 01:07:26.563
Shit, I gotta take this.

01:07:26.564 --> 01:07:27.638
Do you need anything?

01:07:27.639 --> 01:07:32.339
No.

01:07:53.512 --> 01:07:58.212
Where's Duffy?
- You got an appointment?

01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:09.460
Joe, can we have the room
for a minute?

01:08:09.461 --> 01:08:12.478
Thank you.

01:08:12.479 --> 01:08:13.297
It's not too bright,

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:17.997
Walking in here like that, Steve.

01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:22.679
I am in.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.788
I'm coming to work for you.

01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:26.899
A reporter from Roll Call was in here,
this afternoon.

01:08:26.899 --> 01:08:28.470
- Yeah, I know who leaked it.

01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:29.470
Who?

01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:31.764
Paul.
- You told Paul?

01:08:31.765 --> 01:08:32.765
- I told Paul and he leaked it.

01:08:32.765 --> 01:08:35.559
Oh, Steve!

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.594
You shouldn't have told him that.

01:08:37.595 --> 01:08:38.904
I felt like I should.

01:08:38.904 --> 01:08:40.734
I've worked with Paul.
He gets paranoid.

01:08:40.736 --> 01:08:41.736
- Obviously.

01:08:41.737 --> 01:08:42.737
So, he fired you?

01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:45.288
- I quit.
- No, you're lying to me.

01:08:45.290 --> 01:08:46.935
Come on, man.
- I quit!

01:08:46.937 --> 01:08:48.099
I'm gonna give you everything!

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:51.162
I'm gonna give you his whole strategy,
I'm gonna give you all...

01:08:51.163 --> 01:08:52.163
I don't need his whole strategy.
I already have it.

01:08:52.165 --> 01:08:55.118
Paul gave it all to Thompson.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.618
- What if I had something else?

01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:00.580
You would do that to Morris,
To Paul?

01:09:00.581 --> 01:09:01.921
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

01:09:01.923 --> 01:09:04.049
Revenge makes people unpredictable,

01:09:04.050 --> 01:09:06.701
Steve, I can't have someone
who's unpredictable, who's unstable.

01:09:06.702 --> 01:09:08.868
I'm not unstable.

01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:10.484
If you had left Morris,

01:09:10.484 --> 01:09:14.889
before the story broke...
that'd be one thing. That we could control.

01:09:14.890 --> 01:09:16.140
But, like this?

01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:18.676
Paul fires you...
and then, you wanna come work for me...

01:09:18.676 --> 01:09:22.866
It makes me look like, I'm picking up the scrapes.
It puts Morris in the driver seat.

01:09:22.867 --> 01:09:23.867
I can't have that.

01:09:23.790 --> 01:09:26.854
- What If, I had something big?

01:09:26.854 --> 01:09:31.555
Like, what?

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:34.529
- Something Big.

01:09:34.529 --> 01:09:37.669
Something that'll put Morris down.

01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:41.288
What is it?

01:09:41.290 --> 01:09:45.990
- Give me the job.

01:09:47.515 --> 01:09:48.950
No. That's not gonna happen.

01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:50.729
I'm sorry.

01:09:50.729 --> 01:09:53.113
Go take a nice long vacation.

01:09:53.113 --> 01:09:54.269
You're a smart guy.

01:09:54.270 --> 01:09:57.999
Everything that I said,
the other day is absolutely true.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:58.930
But... you know?

01:09:58.931 --> 01:10:01.809
Maybe, politics isn't for you.

01:10:01.810 --> 01:10:03.959
- Politics is my life!

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:04.772
Oh, you know what?

01:10:04.773 --> 01:10:05.773
Do yourself a favour.
Get out...

01:10:05.774 --> 01:10:06.774
Now!

01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:08.749
While you still can.

01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:11.102
G... go into entertainment or business.

01:10:11.103 --> 01:10:13.313
Go open a fucking restaurant
in Costa Rica.

01:10:13.314 --> 01:10:14.242
Anything!

01:10:14.243 --> 01:10:17.169
Do something that's
gonna make you happy... Okay?

01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:18.904
Cos if you stay in this business
long enough,

01:10:18.905 --> 01:10:19.905
You're gonna get jaded and cynical.

01:10:19.906 --> 01:10:20.906
- Like you?

01:10:20.907 --> 01:10:24.629
Yeah, just like me!

01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:28.685
- You knew I was gonna fucking tell Paul.
Didn't you?

01:10:28.686 --> 01:10:29.721
No, I didn't know.

01:10:29.722 --> 01:10:32.089
I thought, you might.
But, I didn't know.

01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:36.063
- You knew I was gonna tell him, you knew...
and you knew that he's gonna fucking fire me.

01:10:36.064 --> 01:10:37.187
Well, that's the thing about Paul.

01:10:37.188 --> 01:10:38.188
He's big on loyalty.

01:10:38.189 --> 01:10:42.889
- Yeah, I know.
I just got a big speech on it.

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.589
You were never gonna hire me?

01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:49.339
Put yourself on my shoes, Steve.

01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:51.490
You're opponent has the best
media mind in the country...

01:10:51.491 --> 01:10:53.358
Working for his team.

01:10:53.359 --> 01:10:56.359
What are you gonna do?

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:58.520
You're either gonna hire him
for yourself...

01:10:58.521 --> 01:10:59.521
Or you're either gonna work it,
so, you can't have him?

01:10:59.522 --> 01:11:02.829
The other team can't either.

01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:06.739
This is a Win-win situation for me.

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:08.741
And you come work for me, great!

01:11:08.742 --> 01:11:10.559
Paul doesn't have you.

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:11.540
But, then again...

01:11:11.541 --> 01:11:13.449
Paul fires you,
I don't want you... fine.

01:11:13.450 --> 01:11:15.749
Paul still doesn't have you.

01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:18.209
Either way, I win.

01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:22.269
And the moment,
I got you sit down on that chair...

01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:23.940
I know, I've won.

01:11:23.941 --> 01:11:25.699
- This is...

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:28.149
It's my life,
that you're talking about.

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:30.360
It doesn't make me happy,
doing this kind of thing.

01:11:30.361 --> 01:11:32.639
Don't think,
it gives me any kind of pleasure.

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:37.340
No, I'm sorry for you.
I really am.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.700
Take care of yourself.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.980
Do you know her?

01:12:54.371 --> 01:12:59.071
She is gone.

01:13:56.199 --> 01:13:57.493
<i><font color="#804040">Molly on phone:</font>
Where are you? It's huh...</i>

01:13:57.494 --> 01:14:02.194
<i>It's four something...
they're gonna close up in few minutes.</i>

01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:05.606
<i>Steven, it's Ben.</i>

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:06.855
<i>Listen, What the fuck?</i>

01:14:06.856 --> 01:14:11.556
<i>Jesus... what're you gonna do?</i>

01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:16.491
<i>Steven, uh...
I just heard from Ben.</i>

01:14:16.492 --> 01:14:18.302
<i>Please... don't do anything fucked up.</i>

01:14:18.303 --> 01:14:20.209
<i>God damn it!
You motherfucker,</i>

01:14:20.210 --> 01:14:21.413
<i>Pick up the phone!</i>

01:14:21.414 --> 01:14:26.114
<i>Don't do this!</i>

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:31.900
<i>I'm not going away.</i>

01:14:36.298 --> 01:14:39.792
<i><font color="#804040">TV announcer:</font> The coroner stated that,

01:14:39.793 --> 01:14:40.793
<i>That this was an accidental overdose.</i>

01:14:40.794 --> 01:14:44.063
<i>A lethal cocktail
of alcohol and prescription drugs.</i>

01:14:44.064 --> 01:14:47.942
<i>Cincinatti Police Chief Daryl Matthews,
has called for a full investigation...</i>

01:14:47.943 --> 01:14:51.520
<i>pending a toxicology report,
which could take up to two weeks.</i>

01:14:51.521 --> 01:14:55.037
<i>Just a terrible,
terrible situation for the former Senator...</i>

01:14:55.038 --> 01:14:59.738
<i>Now, DNC chairman
Jake Sterns and his family.</i>

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:25.379
I want on the ticket,

01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:30.080
You need me on that ticket,
and you could use my delegates.

01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:32.889
And you need them
before tuesday.

01:15:32.890 --> 01:15:36.129
It'll make a fine story,
on the sunday morning news cycle.

01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:39.789
So, I expect to hear from you,
by noon tomorrow.

01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:44.490
Or I endorse Pullman
and take that Cabinet seat.

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:55.380
Anything else,
you wanna talk about, Steven?

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.279
The entire staff is...

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:13.889
in the state of shock.

01:16:13.890 --> 01:16:18.180
We send our condolences
to Jack and Joanna Sterns and their entire family.

01:16:18.181 --> 01:16:20.726
Of course, our hearts go out to them.

01:16:20.727 --> 01:16:24.229
It's hard to imagine,
what they must be going through.

01:16:24.230 --> 01:16:26.899
What we know right now is that,
it appears to have been...

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:29.579
a drug... an accidental

01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:33.305
prescription overdose.

01:16:33.306 --> 01:16:34.459
<i><font color="#804040">Reporter:</font> Is suicide ruled out?</i>

01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:36.829
We have no reason to believe...

01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:38.714
I don't think we have any
information on that yet.

01:16:38.715 --> 01:16:40.821
Obviously, there'll be a full investigation.

01:16:40.822 --> 01:16:43.649
We just wanted to say that,
our hearts go out...

01:16:43.650 --> 01:16:45.479
Our prayers go out...

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.139
to the entire family.

01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:51.618
She really is...
she was part of our family.

01:16:51.619 --> 01:16:52.828
<i>Did you know her well, Governor?</i>

01:16:52.829 --> 01:16:54.710
Not well...
But I did know her.

01:16:54.711 --> 01:16:57.519
What I saw was a
hard working young woman with a...

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:00.469
great spirit.

01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:04.003
It's just a sad day,
for the campaign.

01:17:04.004 --> 01:17:06.317
And it's a sad day
for those of us who knows Jack.

01:17:06.318 --> 01:17:11.018
<i>- Governor,
how long has she interned for you?</i>

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:18.209
She'd only been on the road
with us for a few weeks.

01:17:18.210 --> 01:17:20.339
Maybe, four weeks... I think.

01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:21.662
I can check.

01:17:21.663 --> 01:17:26.363
<i>- Will you be continuing
with your schedule today?</i>

01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:00.220
Seems like you have something
you wanna talk to me about.

01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:05.640
- Does it seem that way?

01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:09.610
You have something,
you think you have something...

01:19:09.611 --> 01:19:12.229
you wanna get off your chest.
Why don't you?

01:19:12.230 --> 01:19:16.930
- How about, I do the talking.
And you do the listening?

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:19.539
Okay.

01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:23.148
- As of tomorrow, there's gonna
be a few changes to your campaign.

01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:25.311
Paul is out.

01:19:25.312 --> 01:19:28.049
I am your Senior Campaign Manager.

01:19:28.050 --> 01:19:30.219
I'll draft the statement...

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:33.178
The campaign got to a point
that we need to make some changes.

01:19:33.179 --> 01:19:34.887
You can put your own words in there.

01:19:34.888 --> 01:19:36.499
Why would I do that?

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:39.759
- Because, you wanna win.

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:42.371
Because, you broke the only rule
in politics.

01:19:42.372 --> 01:19:44.119
You wanna be President...

01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:45.319
You can start a war...

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:47.169
You can lie,
You can cheat...

01:19:47.170 --> 01:19:48.734
You can bankrupt the country...

01:19:48.735 --> 01:19:52.459
but you can't fuck the interns.

01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:56.519
They'll get you for that.

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:59.529
What do you think you have, Steven?

01:19:59.530 --> 01:20:01.412
A troubled young girl,
tells you a story...?

01:20:01.413 --> 01:20:03.289
- A troubled young pregnant girl...

01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:04.383
Is that what she told you?

01:20:04.384 --> 01:20:06.301
- ...who needed cash for an abortion!

01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:07.889
What did you do?
You gave her money?

01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:11.449
Maybe, she just needed cash.
And you're the perfect guy to hit up.

01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:12.765
- Is that your best play?

01:20:12.766 --> 01:20:14.532
You need a job, that bad Steven?

01:20:14.533 --> 01:20:16.289
You coming here,
with your dick in your hand...

01:20:16.290 --> 01:20:17.290
You got nothing!

01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:20.509
- Then, how did I get in here?

01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:22.132
You're right Mike.
There's nothing...

01:20:22.133 --> 01:20:23.133
there's no voice messages...

01:20:23.134 --> 01:20:25.088
no text... no e-mails...

01:20:25.089 --> 01:20:27.699
no pictures and no tape.
And yet...

01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:29.599
I'm standing right here.

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:32.259
Well, go home.

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:36.960
She left a note.

01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:43.949
How would you know that?

01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:46.599
- I was cleaning up your mess.

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:49.739
I took her phone,
and I found a note.

01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:51.789
I thought it was an accident.

01:20:51.790 --> 01:20:52.706
- I don't know, Mike.

01:20:52.707 --> 01:20:53.707
You're gonna have to tell me...

01:20:53.708 --> 01:20:57.179
You're the last person she called.

01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:59.114
Note says, she is pregnant.

01:20:59.115 --> 01:21:00.115
Got an abortion...

01:21:00.116 --> 01:21:03.219
and doesn't wanna hurt you.

01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:06.275
Then why would she leave
a note, that can only do that?

01:21:06.276 --> 01:21:10.809
- She's twenty.

01:21:10.810 --> 01:21:12.036
What do you want?

01:21:12.037 --> 01:21:15.609
- Paul's gone... today.

01:21:15.610 --> 01:21:18.819
I set a meeting with You and Thompson,
and you promise him the ticket.

01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:21.129
You get 356 pledged delegates...

01:21:21.130 --> 01:21:24.319
You get North Carolina...
You take office...

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:26.949
You make right with so many people
that you've made wrong.

01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:29.449
All the things that we both believe in.

01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:32.707
I don't believe in extortion...
I don't believe in tying myself to you...

01:21:32.708 --> 01:21:33.779
for the next eight years!

01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:38.480
- Four years.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:46.449
What were you doing in her room?

01:21:46.450 --> 01:21:48.969
- House keeping,
before you make page one.

01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:50.421
No, you were fired,
You were out.

01:21:50.422 --> 01:21:52.119
What were you doing in her room?

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:54.989
- I was fixing the situation.

01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:57.489
I got a call, someone
from the hotel thought I could help...

01:21:57.490 --> 01:21:58.275
and they called me.

01:21:58.276 --> 01:21:59.276
So, you're off the campaign,

01:21:59.277 --> 01:22:00.277
But you thought it was important...

01:22:00.278 --> 01:22:04.978
...to fix things!

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:12.696
It was your voice,
the other night on the phone.

01:22:12.697 --> 01:22:14.749
You were fucking her.

01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:19.450
What did you do, Steven?

01:22:19.690 --> 01:22:21.260
- I lend her some money
and I gave her a ride.

01:22:21.261 --> 01:22:24.729
I bet you did.

01:22:24.730 --> 01:22:27.569
There's no note.

01:22:27.570 --> 01:22:29.020
- Okay, Mike.
There's no note.

01:22:29.021 --> 01:22:30.021
Show it to me.

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.879
- You think I brought it here?

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:36.580
That's how people get hurt.

01:22:42.616 --> 01:22:43.333
Okay.

01:22:43.334 --> 01:22:45.609
Let's play this out.

01:22:45.610 --> 01:22:49.930
You're not wearing a wire,
because everything you've suggested is illegal.

01:22:49.931 --> 01:22:53.479
And you wouldn't fare
too well, in federal prison.

01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:56.909
You were fucking her
and she told you about her situation.

01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:59.647
There are no records or
conversation between the two of us.

01:22:59.648 --> 01:23:00.859
And since, she's had abortion...

01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:03.759
There's no DNA evidence.

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:07.029
So, there's no note.

01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:11.039
It's word against mine.

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:13.649
Your word.

01:23:13.650 --> 01:23:17.179
A fired, disgruntled employee...

01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:21.880
or a sitting governor.

01:23:23.770 --> 01:23:28.470
There's no note.

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:34.140
- It's your call, Governor.

01:24:23.678 --> 01:24:28.378
Paul, you got a minute?
- Yeah.

01:25:24.030 --> 01:25:25.297
<i><font color="#804040">TV Reporter:</font>
How much could a shake up like this...</i>

01:25:25.298 --> 01:25:28.766
<i>days before the Ohio primary,
Hurt a campaign?</i>

01:25:28.767 --> 01:25:31.814
<i>I asked Paul Zara, How his
firing could actually help the candidate?</i>

01:25:31.815 --> 01:25:35.921
- The governor and I both,
felt that in light of this changing numbers,

01:25:35.922 --> 01:25:38.206
that it was best to put a new face
on the campaign...

01:25:38.207 --> 01:25:39.207
Steven is very talented.

01:25:39.208 --> 01:25:43.908
Very smart.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.329
You always hear people talk about,

01:25:58.330 --> 01:26:00.879
Events out of sequence...

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:05.580
the order of things.

01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:14.435
There's no greater grief,
than a parent laying a child during this.

01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:20.559
She was a little girl...

01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:23.659
trying to make it in a very grown up world.

01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:26.879
A world where,
every mistake is magnified.

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:28.919
And she was smart and pretty...

01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:33.620
and so, so young.

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:38.775
Father, you asked us
to accept God's plan...

01:26:38.776 --> 01:26:41.219
and to not question his judgement.

01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:43.179
With all due respect,

01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:46.429
I don't accept to this judgement.

01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:51.130
She made the world better!

01:26:51.662 --> 01:26:54.449
Not just for me.

01:26:54.450 --> 01:26:59.150
But for everyone she touched.

01:27:10.490 --> 01:27:13.229
You should hire Jack
for a speech writer.

01:27:13.230 --> 01:27:17.549
- I'll keep it in mind.

01:27:17.550 --> 01:27:19.549
You come here to see me?

01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:22.169
No, friends of the family.

01:27:22.170 --> 01:27:26.291
I got her the internship.

01:27:26.292 --> 01:27:29.601
I've known her since
she was born.

01:27:29.602 --> 01:27:33.559
- Sorry.

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:36.579
The governor couldn't make the flight?

01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:40.064
- He's meeting with Thompson.

01:27:40.065 --> 01:27:41.549
Look at you.

01:27:41.550 --> 01:27:46.039
All grown up with
tits and all.

01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:50.740
- I learned from the best.

01:27:51.710 --> 01:27:54.929
Well, one day we'll grab a beer and...

01:27:54.930 --> 01:27:58.179
you could tell me, what you had
on the governor that put me out.

01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:02.880
- How do you know
I didn't have something on you?

01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:09.269
You better get going...

01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:12.199
You have a campaign to run
and I've got offices to look at.

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:15.629
- North?

01:28:15.630 --> 01:28:18.939
Nice consulting firm,
out of K street.

01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:21.379
A million a year.

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:24.039
No one to fuck you over.

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.170
- Sounds relaxing.

01:28:26.171 --> 01:28:30.871
Doesn't it?

01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:36.450
<i><font color="#804040">Thompson:</font> The right man to lead
this nation of ours.</i>

01:28:36.451 --> 01:28:37.529
<i>In this chanllenging times...</i>

01:28:37.530 --> 01:28:39.069
<i>and...</i>

01:28:39.070 --> 01:28:40.869
<i>and the next President...</i>

01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:43.369
of The United States of America...

01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:48.070
Governor Mike Morris!

01:28:52.810 --> 01:28:56.499
<i>And let me ask,
one very important thing.</i>

01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:59.035
<i>That all of us stand,
shoulder to shoulder...</i>

01:28:59.036 --> 01:29:03.736
<i>arm and arm,
in a united democrat party...</i>

01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:08.397
<i>So, I strongly urge
the three hundred and fifty six</i>

01:29:08.398 --> 01:29:11.579
<i>loyal delegates that I've
carried as a badge of honour...</i>

01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:15.722
<i>Throw their support to the governor,
lets put this primary behind us...</i>

01:29:15.723 --> 01:29:19.745
<i>And get on with the business
of sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue!</i>

01:29:19.746 --> 01:29:24.446
<i>Thank you, God bless you...
and God Bless The United States of America!</i>

01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:39.689
Thank you.

01:29:39.690 --> 01:29:41.839
Well, the polls aren't quite closed.

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:46.069
But I do wanna congratulate
Senator Pullman and his republican constituents,

01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:50.770
on their win here in Ohio.

01:29:55.504 --> 01:29:58.419
Senator Thompson,
I'm honoured to stand with you here today.

01:29:58.420 --> 01:30:01.474
And I'm humbled
by your kind words.

01:30:01.475 --> 01:30:03.949
Thank you.

01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:06.749
Ladies and Gentlement, today
marks the begining of the fight between...

01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:09.099
Two sets of ideals.

01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:13.800
Either we're gonna move forward or
we're going to live in the past?

01:30:13.937 --> 01:30:17.754
Either we're going to lead the world
again on technology or we are going to bury,

01:30:17.755 --> 01:30:21.175
our heads in the sands?

01:30:21.176 --> 01:30:25.876
The sands of Saudi Arabia.
The sands of Iraq?

01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:29.519
Either we are going to let
Greed and corruption

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:32.369
ruin our industries and our shorelines...

01:30:32.370 --> 01:30:37.070
or we are going
to take back our country?

01:30:37.307 --> 01:30:40.100
We are not a nation
used to come in second...

01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:44.801
or third???

01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:10.749
Hey, Ben?

01:31:10.750 --> 01:31:14.339
I was told to talk to you,
I'm suppose to get a phone.

01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:15.691
And you are?

01:31:15.692 --> 01:31:16.692
- Joe Morris.

01:31:16.693 --> 01:31:19.019
No relation.

01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:20.700
You're a Beercat Joe Morris?

01:31:20.701 --> 01:31:25.401
- No, I'm from Columbus,
I'm a Buckeye.

01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:41.550
You're making me look bad.

01:31:41.551 --> 01:31:43.779
- How so?

01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:45.949
I filed the story that said you're
off the campaign...

01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:48.489
And Thompson is going to Pullman.

01:31:48.490 --> 01:31:51.339
You can't believe
everything you read.

01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:54.779
I just wanna give you
an opportunity to comment on my next story.

01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:56.436
Says you delivered Thompson.

01:31:56.437 --> 01:31:58.446
You got that 356 delegates,

01:31:58.447 --> 01:32:01.809
you delivered the nomination.
And all you ask in return is Paul's job.

01:32:01.810 --> 01:32:03.709
Any chance of you confirming now?
- No press behind this point.

01:32:03.710 --> 01:32:04.710
She's press.

01:32:04.711 --> 01:32:05.711
I'll read about it
in the funny papers.

01:32:05.712 --> 01:32:08.012
Come on, Steven?

01:32:08.013 --> 01:32:12.713
Aren't we friends anymore?

01:32:13.379 --> 01:32:18.079
You are my best friend, Ida.

01:34:38.874 --> 01:34:43.574
