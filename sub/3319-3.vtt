WEBVTT

00:03.307 --> 00:04.787
Previously onMom...I just found out
my teenage daughter is pregnant.

00:04.874 --> 00:07.703
Really?
Wow.

00:07.790 --> 00:10.706
She's not a cheerleader
with an overbite, is she?

00:12.012 --> 00:13.926
No, why?

00:14.014 --> 00:17.060
No reason.

00:17.147 --> 00:20.759
I love you and
I'm gonna love your baby.

00:21.804 --> 00:22.935
It's our baby.

00:23.023 --> 00:26.548
What?

00:28.941 --> 00:30.856
I'm sorry, I got
a lot on my mind.

00:30.943 --> 00:33.120
Well, I'm a good listener.

00:33.207 --> 00:35.252
A penny for your thoughts?

00:35.339 --> 00:38.081
Okay, fine. How's this?

00:38.168 --> 00:41.128
I'm working my ass off so I
can take care of my children,

00:41.215 --> 00:43.956
I just found out I'm gonna
be a freaking grandma,

00:44.044 --> 00:45.697
and the man that
I'm sleeping with

00:45.784 --> 00:47.134
only has time for me when
his wife is out of town,

00:47.221 --> 00:48.135
and I desperately want

00:48.222 --> 00:49.571
to run away from it all

00:49.658 --> 00:51.312
with a bottle of this,
but I can't

00:51.399 --> 00:52.748
because my name is Christy
and I'm an alcoholic.

00:52.835 --> 00:55.707
Hola,Christy.

00:57.535 --> 00:58.841
[sighs]

00:58.928 --> 01:00.234
Are we ready to order?

01:00.321 --> 01:01.539
Yeah, I think so.

01:01.626 --> 01:02.627
Sis?

01:02.714 --> 01:03.976
You go first.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.804
Thanks for putting
me on the spot.

01:05.891 --> 01:07.980
My sister does this
to me all the time.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.157
[growls]

01:10.244 --> 01:12.637
Okay.

01:12.724 --> 01:13.595
Family, huh?

01:13.682 --> 01:15.205
Yep.
Yeah.

01:15.292 --> 01:16.511
Okay, let's see.

01:16.598 --> 01:18.382
I would like the
scallop risotto

01:18.469 --> 01:19.557
since I am not allergic to
shellfish, unlike my sister.

01:19.644 --> 01:20.602
[clears throat]

01:22.865 --> 01:24.910
Idiot.

01:24.997 --> 01:25.998
Good choice.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.348
Thanks, yeah.

01:27.435 --> 01:29.698
We're celebrating
her divorce.

01:29.785 --> 01:30.916
Now we're both single.

01:33.136 --> 01:36.835
I hope my son and daughter
can be there for each other

01:36.922 --> 01:38.010
when their spouses
inevitably turn on them.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.578
Oh, you have
children.

01:40.665 --> 01:42.145
I love children.

01:42.232 --> 01:43.103
I-I believe
they're our future.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.107
So, how about you?

01:47.194 --> 01:48.891
Do, do you have a spouse
who turned on you?

01:48.978 --> 01:50.458
Oh, yeah, lot of hard feelings.

01:50.545 --> 01:52.068
Ah, terrific.
Wow.

01:54.244 --> 01:55.115
Can I grab you
for just a sec?

01:55.202 --> 01:58.640
I'll be right back.

01:58.727 --> 02:01.338
He probably needs me to open up
a jar of pickles or something.

02:02.687 --> 02:03.035
Okay, well, bye.

02:06.691 --> 02:07.649
Was that guy hitting on you?

02:07.736 --> 02:10.347
Yeah, he absolutely was.

02:10.434 --> 02:11.696
Thought so.

02:11.783 --> 02:13.263
I'll ask Richard
to take the table.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.004
Why?I don't want him bothering you.

02:15.091 --> 02:16.092
He's not.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.181
Is he bothering you?

02:18.268 --> 02:20.009
No, I'm just protective of you

02:20.096 --> 02:22.925
'cause you and I have,
you know, something special

02:23.012 --> 02:25.580
going on.

02:25.667 --> 02:26.058
Yeah, it's
called adultery.

02:29.845 --> 02:31.107
Why do you make it sound
so cheap and ugly?

02:31.194 --> 02:34.458
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:34.545 --> 02:36.199
Unicorns, rainbows, you're
cheating on your wife.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.205
I told you
they were doing it.

02:46.209 --> 02:47.993
And another thing--

02:48.080 --> 02:50.822
you have no right to tell me
who I can and cannot see.

02:50.909 --> 02:51.823
What are you saying?

02:51.910 --> 02:52.998
We're not monogamous?

02:54.957 --> 02:56.828
Gabriel, you're married.

02:56.915 --> 02:58.221
We do it once a month,

02:58.308 --> 03:00.267
and I don't even
take off my T-shirt.

03:04.619 --> 03:06.534
Let me make it
simple for you.

03:06.621 --> 03:09.189
All of this stuff
here is in play.

03:14.106 --> 03:17.719
[exclaiming
indistinctly]

03:23.290 --> 03:25.205
Oh, that's good thinking.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.641
Uh, Gabriel,

03:26.728 --> 03:28.295
Paul and I would like you
to give us money

03:28.382 --> 03:31.080
not to tell your wife
you're banging Christy.

03:34.518 --> 03:37.086
A lot of money.

03:39.610 --> 03:40.872
Hey, sis, look
who's back.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.439
Give it a rest.

03:42.526 --> 03:43.353
So, what's the deal
with your brother?

03:43.440 --> 03:44.267
Good guy, whack job?

03:44.354 --> 03:46.574
Give it to me straight.

03:46.661 --> 03:48.271
I'm a single mom and I
don't have a lot of time.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.317
He's amazing.

03:50.404 --> 03:52.493
I'd go out with him, you know,

03:52.580 --> 03:54.538
if it didn't make us
hillbillies.

03:56.192 --> 03:58.716
All right.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.805
I'll write my phone number
on the check.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.677
Hold on a second.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.244
What makes you think I was
even trying to ask you out?

04:05.245 --> 04:07.203
You weren't?

04:07.290 --> 04:09.858
Oh, uh, this is,
this is awkward.

04:09.945 --> 04:11.425
Let me get you a new server.

04:11.512 --> 04:13.209
Wait, now, I was just
trying to be cool.

04:17.213 --> 04:19.259
Mission accomplished.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.801
This is a cute top.

04:39.888 --> 04:43.021
Oh, that's actually a party
dress from my drinking days.

04:43.108 --> 04:44.371
Wow.

04:44.458 --> 04:45.720
Were you drinking
when you bought it?

04:46.808 --> 04:48.853
I hope so.

04:48.940 --> 04:50.290
Anyway,
it doesn't matter,

04:50.377 --> 04:51.856
I'm not that kind
of girl anymore.

04:51.943 --> 04:53.597
Hello.

04:53.684 --> 04:54.729
What kind of girl were
you when you wore this?

04:56.731 --> 04:57.819
Popular.

04:59.864 --> 05:01.736
Oh, my God, I hate

05:01.823 --> 05:03.303
everything in my closet.

05:03.390 --> 05:07.655
It all looks like Halloween
in Slutsylvania.

05:07.742 --> 05:10.832
Calm down,
we'll find something.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.616
Okay, so tell me
about this guy tonight.

05:12.703 --> 05:14.966
[groans]
I don't know.

05:15.053 --> 05:19.319
Cute, kind of boyish...
pretty normal really.

05:19.406 --> 05:22.626
You just described
every serial killer.

05:22.713 --> 05:25.803
No, he loves his sister,
which I take as a good sign.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.632
Boing, my gay-dar just went off.

05:28.719 --> 05:29.807
He's not gay.

05:29.894 --> 05:32.593
He puts ketchup on his steak.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.116
I don't get

05:34.203 --> 05:35.552
what you're so jittery about.

05:35.639 --> 05:37.032
You know how to do this.

05:37.119 --> 05:38.990
I know how to do this drunk.

05:39.077 --> 05:41.210
Come on, you've been dating
your boss since you got sober.

05:41.297 --> 05:44.126
[groans]
You can't call
what we do dating.

05:44.213 --> 05:47.651
It's just sex
in uncomfortable places.

05:47.738 --> 05:50.219
I hope you mean broom closets.

05:50.306 --> 05:52.700
Yes.

05:52.787 --> 05:54.919
Oh, Mom, God.

05:57.313 --> 05:59.968
The point is,

06:00.055 --> 06:02.318
Gabriel's married,
so there's no future with him.

06:02.405 --> 06:04.451
But this guy tonight, who knows?

06:04.538 --> 06:08.106
We could wind up with
a little house, picket fence,

06:08.193 --> 06:11.545
missionary sex twice a week.

06:11.632 --> 06:13.198
You know, I had sex
with a missionary once

06:13.285 --> 06:16.376
and oddly he was not
a fan of that position.

06:17.420 --> 06:20.423
Thank you for that image.

06:20.510 --> 06:22.817
I'm just worried that if he
finds out the kind of person

06:22.904 --> 06:24.296
I was, he won't like me.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.428
Oh, honey.

06:25.515 --> 06:26.647
I know, it's silly.

06:26.734 --> 06:28.257
It's not silly--

06:28.344 --> 06:30.564
you should definitely
lie about your past.

06:30.651 --> 06:31.565
What?

06:31.652 --> 06:33.001
Yeah, sometimes I like

06:33.088 --> 06:34.306
to tell guys
I'm Carole Anne Stevenson

06:34.394 --> 06:36.526
from Albuquerque, New Mexico.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.528
You're kidding.

06:38.615 --> 06:40.138
Nope, Carole's a schoolteacher

06:40.225 --> 06:41.662
like her mother
and her Aunt Judy.

06:41.749 --> 06:43.272
She loves baking and gardening

06:43.359 --> 06:45.666
and volunteering
down at the homeless shelter.

06:45.753 --> 06:49.409
Now tell me about this.

06:52.412 --> 06:52.847
That's actually yours.

06:56.981 --> 07:00.071
Are you taking the prenatal
vitamins we got you?

07:00.158 --> 07:01.638
Uh-huh.

07:01.725 --> 07:02.639
Did you stop smoking
pot and drinking?

07:02.726 --> 07:03.640
Of course.

07:03.727 --> 07:04.641
Don't bite my head off.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.861
Not everybody does.

07:06.948 --> 07:08.906
[sighs]

07:08.993 --> 07:12.432
Thanks for looking
after Roscoe tonight.

07:12.519 --> 07:13.911
Yeah, whatever.

07:13.998 --> 07:15.870
You're really wearing that
on a date?

07:17.654 --> 07:19.569
What's wrong with it?

07:19.656 --> 07:22.137
You look
like a slutty highlighter.

07:24.008 --> 07:25.967
You know what?

07:26.054 --> 07:27.925
I think I look great,
and that's all that matters.

07:29.971 --> 07:31.059
Where are you going?

07:31.146 --> 07:33.453
Where do you think? To change.

07:35.367 --> 07:36.238
Why are you being such a bitch?

07:36.325 --> 07:38.066
I'm just being honest.

07:38.153 --> 07:39.502
Good, I'll be honest, too.

07:39.589 --> 07:40.851
You're being a bitch.

07:41.983 --> 07:43.332
And I use that word

07:43.419 --> 07:45.116
instead of the word
I want to use

07:45.203 --> 07:46.944
because you're my granddaughter
and I love you.

07:47.031 --> 07:48.859
What, so I'm supposed
to make a big deal

07:48.946 --> 07:52.428
just because she's going out
with some random guy?

07:52.515 --> 07:54.561
Excuse me, young lady,
but your mother going out

07:54.648 --> 07:58.695
with some random guy is
the only reason you exist.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.088
And I'll tell you
another thing--

08:00.175 --> 08:01.785
if she doesn't
meet somebody,

08:01.872 --> 08:03.308
she's going to turn
into one of those

08:03.395 --> 08:04.440
crazy old ladies with 20 cats

08:04.527 --> 08:06.050
who lives with their daughter.

08:06.137 --> 08:07.399
You're going to be chasing her
down the street,

08:07.487 --> 08:09.489
trying to pin her robe shut.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.796
[sighs]

08:12.883 --> 08:13.841
Better?

08:13.928 --> 08:14.842
Ugh.

08:14.929 --> 08:17.627
Damn it.

08:18.585 --> 08:19.499
Mom, wait.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.675
What?

08:21.762 --> 08:22.980
Why don't you try on
that black dress in my closet?

08:23.067 --> 08:25.722
I think it'll look cute on you.

08:25.809 --> 08:28.203
Thank you.

08:28.290 --> 08:31.554
Well, look at you
being a nice person.

08:31.641 --> 08:33.207
I'll tell you what.

08:33.294 --> 08:34.818
As a reward, why don't you go
out with Luke tonight

08:34.905 --> 08:36.211
and I'll watch Roscoe?

08:36.298 --> 08:37.691
You don't have plans?

08:37.778 --> 08:39.301
Nah, at my age,
when you've had sex

08:39.388 --> 08:39.909
in the afternoon,
you're good for the whole day.

08:45.742 --> 08:46.830
[sighs]

08:46.917 --> 08:48.092
[both chuckle]

08:52.009 --> 08:53.794
If our waitress is cute,

08:53.881 --> 08:55.752
it's totally okay
to say I'm your sister.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.711
[chuckles]

08:57.798 --> 08:59.843
No, I'm good.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.541
Have you ever eaten here before?

09:01.628 --> 09:02.759
No, I haven't.

09:02.846 --> 09:03.891
[chuckles]

09:03.978 --> 09:04.892
How about you?

09:04.979 --> 09:05.936
No.

09:06.023 --> 09:07.329
Ah, look at us.

09:07.416 --> 09:08.504
We already have something
in common.

09:08.591 --> 09:09.505
[chuckles]

09:09.592 --> 09:11.376
Yeah.

09:11.463 --> 09:13.204
So, what do you do?

09:13.291 --> 09:15.729
Oh, yeah, I'm,
I'm a civil engineer.

09:15.816 --> 09:16.773
Wow.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.035
Yeah.

09:18.122 --> 09:20.124
I have no idea why I said wow

09:20.211 --> 09:21.996
'cause I don't know
what that is.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.041
Oh, okay, uh,

09:24.128 --> 09:25.695
well, today,
for instance,

09:25.782 --> 09:27.305
the city decided that it
needed a new stoplight,

09:27.392 --> 09:29.743
so it's my job to go
over all the contracts

09:29.830 --> 09:31.005
with the stoplight
manufacturers

09:31.092 --> 09:32.876
and just get
the best price

09:32.963 --> 09:36.401
for the s-stoplight.

09:38.403 --> 09:41.493
That sounds crazy.

09:42.494 --> 09:44.105
No, it's pretty boring.

09:44.192 --> 09:46.411
No, no, no, it's not.

09:46.498 --> 09:49.197
From now on, every time
I stop at a red light,

09:49.284 --> 09:50.415
I'll think of you.

09:50.502 --> 09:53.027
Oh, so th-that'll be often.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.420
Not really, I tend to just
blow right through 'em.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.338
Good evening, folks.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.297
Can I start you off
with a cocktail or some wine?

10:02.384 --> 10:02.993
Yes, would you like a drink?

10:03.080 --> 10:05.822
No, thank you.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.258
Ah, come on,
live a little.

10:07.345 --> 10:09.957
Oh, you can live a little
for both of us.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.349
No, don't be silly.

10:11.436 --> 10:12.655
Glass of wine
never hurt anyone.

10:12.742 --> 10:14.048
Oh, boy.

10:15.179 --> 10:17.355
I don't drink--

10:17.442 --> 10:19.575
not because I don't want to
but because I can't.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.490
It wrecked my life,
it destroyed my relationships,

10:21.577 --> 10:23.100
and I'm still picking up
the pieces,

10:23.187 --> 10:24.798
but if you want a glass
of wine, you go right ahead.

10:24.885 --> 10:25.799
Won't bother me at all.

10:25.886 --> 10:27.714
I'm his sister.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.590
So once I finally
quit drinking, I had

10:34.677 --> 10:36.461
all these feelings come up,
and I didn't know

10:36.548 --> 10:38.376
how to deal with them,
so I started eating.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.117
Every night after work
I'd come home,

10:40.204 --> 10:42.990
I'd take a bag of
salt-and-vinegar potato chips,

10:43.077 --> 10:45.079
I'd hit it with a book
so it was just crumbs,

10:45.166 --> 10:47.255
and I'd mix it with a pint
of vanilla ice cream.

10:47.342 --> 10:49.083
I gained 18 pounds in,
like, a month.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.259
Then in the middle of the night,
I woke up and I thought

10:51.346 --> 10:52.826
I had a cat on my lap--
looked down

10:52.913 --> 10:54.566
turns out it was my own stomach.

11:00.964 --> 11:03.358
I don't think I can do this.

11:09.451 --> 11:12.236
It's our first date.

11:16.110 --> 11:18.895
Okay, you've got an eight,
and I give you...

11:18.982 --> 11:20.984
a seven--
how many is that?

11:21.071 --> 11:21.724
Fifteen.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.465
Very good.

11:23.552 --> 11:27.295
Now, the house is
showing a face card.

11:27.382 --> 11:28.426
And you're the house.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.777
Yes, I am.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.779
How much you want to bet?

11:33.867 --> 11:34.694
All of it.

11:34.781 --> 11:37.827
On a 15. Interesting.

11:39.611 --> 11:42.223
Ooh! Another eight.
How many is that?

11:42.310 --> 11:44.268
Twenty-three?

11:44.355 --> 11:46.009
But the name of the game is...?

11:46.096 --> 11:47.141
"Twenty-One."

11:47.228 --> 11:49.709
Exactly.

11:49.796 --> 11:52.146
Thanks for
watching Roscoe.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.669
We'll see you later.Hey, hang on.

11:58.761 --> 12:01.546
You listen to me, teen Jesus...

12:04.462 --> 12:08.640
I want my granddaughter back
by 11:00 with her hymen intact.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.730
What?!

12:12.035 --> 12:13.733
I'm just screwing with you.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.518
You already knocked her up;
do whatever you want.

12:16.605 --> 12:19.695
I know that was supposed
to be funny,

12:19.782 --> 12:21.741
but I peed myself a little.

12:24.569 --> 12:28.051
Sorry, sir, only
players at the table.

12:28.138 --> 12:30.097
I want to play more blackjack.

12:30.184 --> 12:31.620
Okay. Ante up.

12:31.707 --> 12:34.144
I can't. I don't
have any more money.

12:34.231 --> 12:35.145
No money?

12:35.232 --> 12:38.801
Or no money onyou?

12:38.888 --> 12:40.847
I have some in my piggy bank.

12:40.934 --> 12:44.546
Well, it's not doing you
any good in there, is it?

12:45.677 --> 12:46.722
Be right back.

12:48.593 --> 12:51.596
Wait'll I teach him
how to play pai gow.

12:56.297 --> 12:59.474
Oh, God, I'm gonna die alone.

13:04.131 --> 13:05.654
Please let it be now.

13:05.741 --> 13:07.830
Open the door.

13:07.917 --> 13:08.526
[groans]

13:08.613 --> 13:10.746
Damn it!

13:15.142 --> 13:17.144
Hey. Hope you're hungry,
'cause I...

13:17.231 --> 13:20.147
brought us dinner.What? How?

13:20.234 --> 13:21.496
As I was chasing you
out of the restaurant,

13:21.583 --> 13:23.541
I bought a guy's to-go order.Really?

13:23.628 --> 13:26.588
Yeah.That's so adorable.

13:26.675 --> 13:29.547
And/or... desperate.

13:29.634 --> 13:32.115
Well, let's go with adorable.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.987
'Cause I really
want you to like me.

13:34.074 --> 13:36.293
[laughs]Okay, let's see what
we're having for dinner.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.121
This looks like
some kind of chicken.

13:38.208 --> 13:39.906
Ooh, I love some
kind of chicken.

13:39.993 --> 13:42.212
Yeah? Okay, okay.

13:42.299 --> 13:45.955
And I have a pasta--
looks like, uh, Bolognese.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.261
Ooh, I like that, too!

13:47.348 --> 13:49.524
You want to switch?No, no, no.

13:49.611 --> 13:53.267
Well, yeah.Yeah. Okay.

13:53.354 --> 13:54.703
Wow.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.705
Uh-oh, no,
there are no utensils.

13:56.792 --> 14:00.752
Oh. Check the glove compartment.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.016
I eat in my car a lot.[chuckles]

14:03.103 --> 14:04.756
[glove compartment clicks open]Oh.

14:05.757 --> 14:07.237
Ooh.

14:07.324 --> 14:08.195
Fancy.

14:11.589 --> 14:12.852
Okay, time for bed.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.723
I'll tell you what,
just to show you

14:14.810 --> 14:17.160
how much we appreciate
your business,

14:17.247 --> 14:19.684
we're gonna comp your room.

14:19.771 --> 14:22.774
Come on, just one more game.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.472
Well, sorry, buddy,
but you're broke.

14:24.559 --> 14:26.691
Well, um, how about
if you lend me five dollars

14:26.778 --> 14:29.781
and I'll pay you back
when I win?

14:29.869 --> 14:30.957
Oh, sweetheart,
you're gonna grow up

14:31.044 --> 14:33.829
and make some
nice lady so sad.

14:36.136 --> 14:38.094
[knocking on door]

14:38.181 --> 14:39.966
How about if I sell you my iPod?

14:40.053 --> 14:42.055
That might work.

14:43.143 --> 14:44.535
Hey.

14:44.622 --> 14:45.623
What can I do for you, Baxter?

14:45.710 --> 14:47.060
Just came to see my kid.

14:47.147 --> 14:49.584
Hey, Dad, can you
lend me some money?

14:49.671 --> 14:53.588
That's so weird-- I was
gonna ask you the same thing.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.720
[siren blaring]

14:55.807 --> 14:58.767
I'm gonna hang
with you guys for a bit.

15:00.856 --> 15:04.120
Here's a question for you.Shoot.

15:04.207 --> 15:05.948
What's wrong with you that
you would chase a crazy lady

15:06.035 --> 15:09.038
out of a restaurant with a bag
of someone else's food?

15:09.125 --> 15:11.301
Why does something
have to be wrong with me

15:11.388 --> 15:12.650
for me to like you?

15:12.737 --> 15:15.175
Nice try.
Answer the question.

15:15.262 --> 15:17.438
No, seriously, I
thought we really made
a connection in there.

15:17.525 --> 15:18.787
Answer the question.

15:18.874 --> 15:21.833
Okay, uh...

15:21.921 --> 15:24.749
well, I did just get out
of a relationship.

15:24.836 --> 15:26.490
That's what I'm talking about.

15:26.577 --> 15:27.927
Tell me about it.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.407
She-she was very nice. Sweet.

15:30.494 --> 15:33.062
No drama. Um...

15:33.149 --> 15:35.804
Her name wasn't
Carol Anne Stevenson, was it?

15:35.891 --> 15:37.458
Yeah, why?

15:37.545 --> 15:39.416
No reason. Continue.

15:39.503 --> 15:42.071
Anyway, uh, she was great,
but in all the time

15:42.158 --> 15:44.813
we were together, she never once
told me how she was feeling.

15:44.900 --> 15:48.730
Whereas you, literally,
can't stop telling me.

15:48.817 --> 15:51.211
I'm-I'm sorry.
I feel terrible.

15:51.298 --> 15:52.560
See? You just did it again.

15:52.647 --> 15:54.214
Okay, but in my defense,

15:54.301 --> 15:57.478
I am emotionally
all over the place.Oh, wow!

15:57.565 --> 15:59.480
There it is again.And I am dealing

15:59.567 --> 16:00.916
with a number of personal crises

16:01.003 --> 16:02.439
which you really
don't need to know about,

16:02.526 --> 16:04.137
but I feel like
I'm gonna tell you anyway.

16:04.224 --> 16:06.052
What is wrong with me?
Why can't I stop talking?

16:09.794 --> 16:12.145
Well, that shut me up.

16:18.586 --> 16:19.804
Nice.

16:19.891 --> 16:21.023
Yeah.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.677
Now what?

16:22.764 --> 16:26.028
Now you get out of my car.

16:26.115 --> 16:29.118
Why? I love it in here.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.600
I'm sorry.

16:32.687 --> 16:34.123
This is good, you're good,

16:34.210 --> 16:37.909
but I am clearly not ready
to start dating.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.911
I wish I could disagree.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.786
But I want you to know
that when I am...

16:44.873 --> 16:46.918
you are at the top of my list.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.269
And the list
isn't very long.

16:49.356 --> 16:50.835
In fact, it's just you.

16:50.922 --> 16:51.749
[chuckles]:
Great.

16:58.321 --> 17:01.672
You're not as crazy
as you think you are.

17:01.759 --> 17:05.023
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

17:06.982 --> 17:09.419
Run.

17:11.247 --> 17:12.857
What do you want to do
with that soft 19?

17:12.944 --> 17:15.512
I'll hold.

17:15.598 --> 17:17.384
Hold? What's that?

17:18.733 --> 17:20.691
BAXTER:
It means you have

17:20.778 --> 17:23.607
a number you like, and you're
not gonna take any more cards.

17:28.351 --> 17:28.873
You can hold?

17:31.963 --> 17:34.096
[doorbell rings]I'll get it.

17:34.183 --> 17:36.664
[quietly]:
I was never here.

17:38.361 --> 17:39.493
You can hold?!

17:42.148 --> 17:44.193
Oh. Hi. Is-is Christy here?

17:44.280 --> 17:45.499
Who might be asking?

17:45.586 --> 17:46.587
Um, I work with her.

17:46.674 --> 17:47.936
Oh. You must be her boss.

17:48.023 --> 17:49.981
I am.You leave your wife yet?

17:53.637 --> 17:55.161
No.

17:55.248 --> 17:56.945
Then I have no choice
but to inform you

17:57.032 --> 17:59.034
that she is out on a date
with a wealthy, educated,

17:59.121 --> 18:02.037
eligible bachelor who's got
a cannon between his legs.

18:05.258 --> 18:08.435
So her mom's not a fan.

18:08.522 --> 18:11.351
MAN [recorded]:
...by focusing on the positive,

18:11.438 --> 18:14.745
I attract only the best
into my life.

18:14.832 --> 18:17.096
By focusing on the positive...

18:17.183 --> 18:17.922
[shrieks]

18:18.009 --> 18:19.968
Oh, my God!

18:20.055 --> 18:22.188
[gasps]

18:22.275 --> 18:23.014
Oh!

18:24.973 --> 18:26.714
Are you okay?

18:26.801 --> 18:29.369
Uh, I think
you broke my foot.Oh...

18:29.456 --> 18:31.414
And maybe my nose.Oh!

18:31.501 --> 18:33.242
Sorry, sorry.
Okay, don't-don't move.

18:33.329 --> 18:34.852
I'm gonna call an ambulance.No, wait!

18:34.939 --> 18:37.942
My wife can't know I was here.

18:38.029 --> 18:41.207
Okay, well, um,
let's get you in the car,

18:41.294 --> 18:43.209
and I'll take you
to the emergency room.

18:44.645 --> 18:47.430
Ow! Ow! Careful.

18:47.517 --> 18:48.823
Careful.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.999
It... it, uh, hurts
pretty bad, huh?

18:51.086 --> 18:53.088
It's awful.

18:55.177 --> 18:57.048
Well, then this
probably isn't

18:57.136 --> 18:59.529
a great time to
say this, but...

18:59.616 --> 19:02.097
um, I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.926
Wait, you're
breaking up with me?

19:06.101 --> 19:07.581
Why?!

19:07.668 --> 19:09.539
Well, uh...

19:09.626 --> 19:12.716
I found out something
about myself tonight.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.109
[sighs]: Um...

19:14.196 --> 19:16.590
I deserve to be
in a relationship

19:16.677 --> 19:18.853
with a man who...
I can hit with my car

19:18.940 --> 19:22.204
and... you know...

19:22.291 --> 19:23.901
not feel like I did
something wrong.

19:27.383 --> 19:29.994
Okay, uh...

19:30.081 --> 19:32.040
I'm not sure what
that means, but...

19:32.127 --> 19:33.476
[screams]What?!

19:33.563 --> 19:34.477
What?

19:34.564 --> 19:37.132
There's a fork in my ass!

19:44.705 --> 19:46.924
Knocky-knocky.Hi.

19:47.011 --> 19:48.404
How's your little boss?

19:48.491 --> 19:51.538
Oh, I broke his leg
and his nose.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.844
Admit it, it felt
pretty good, didn't it?

19:53.931 --> 19:56.107
No! No, no, no.

19:56.978 --> 19:59.502
A little bit.

19:59.589 --> 20:02.462
I got you a gift.

20:02.549 --> 20:04.377
Thanks.
What's the occasion?

20:04.464 --> 20:06.422
Well, I know you don't feel
ready to date for a while.

20:06.509 --> 20:09.643
I thought this might put
a little spring in your step.

20:09.730 --> 20:10.383
What is it?

20:11.471 --> 20:12.428
[vibrating]

20:20.567 --> 20:21.394
Thank you.

20:24.571 --> 20:27.138
Do you mind finishing
the dishes?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.358
My pleasure.
I am such a good mother.
