08:20.501 --> 08:21.725
and then go to their ex's
for dinner all the time.

08:21.818 --> 08:23.393
That's a thing for sure.

08:23.411 --> 08:25.319
So, um, what's our backstory?
How long have we been together?

08:25.339 --> 08:27.154
Backstory?
We need a backstory?

08:27.249 --> 08:29.082
Yeah, I'm into prep, Mike.
I'm not good at lying.

08:29.234 --> 08:30.400
I am not good at winging it.

08:30.493 --> 08:32.736
Got you, okay.
So we need a backstory.

08:32.829 --> 08:34.179
Actually, we met on the show,
which is true.

08:34.330 --> 08:35.905
So we don't even have to lie.

08:35.999 --> 08:36.998
Okay,
and there's one other thing.

08:37.092 --> 08:37.999
You don't love chicken.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.017
I don't love your outfit.

08:39.168 --> 08:40.593
What's wrong with my outfit?

08:40.746 --> 08:41.836
You look like you're going
to happy hour

08:41.855 --> 08:43.004
at Buffalo Wild Wings.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.248
That hurts.
I love Buffalo Wild Wings.

08:45.417 --> 08:46.750
Let's go steal something
from wardrobe.

08:46.843 --> 08:48.268
Okay, I like that idea.

08:48.403 --> 08:49.510
Can I get two socks that match?

08:49.604 --> 08:51.271
-Oh, yeah.
-I've just never had that.

08:51.423 --> 08:53.256
-Oh, what about a bow tie?
-No.

08:53.275 --> 08:55.349
So let's start
with the fight in Chicago.

08:55.443 --> 08:56.760
Screw Chicago!

08:56.928 --> 08:58.762
You made me look like
a home-wrecker in the trailer!

08:58.930 --> 09:00.430
That's the truth,
but I want to know

09:00.448 --> 09:02.356
why I look like
a disgruntled housewife.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.358
Do you know how many followers
I have lost?

09:04.378 --> 09:06.211
Oh, talk to me, Julia.
What are you so afraid of?

09:06.438 --> 09:07.937
This is a show about dance,

09:08.031 --> 09:09.773
not about my husband
running away.

09:09.791 --> 09:10.790
BOTH: Where'd he go?

09:10.942 --> 09:11.883
(chuckles)

09:12.035 --> 09:14.368
<i> (soft music)</i>

09:14.388 --> 09:15.612
No clue.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.872
Last I heard, he was
in Costa Rica for 48 hours,

09:17.949 --> 09:19.057
and then he was gone.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.967
I will say, however,

09:21.119 --> 09:22.452
that I have learned
a great deal

09:22.545 --> 09:24.378
about his spending habits
over the past year,

09:24.398 --> 09:27.065
which include
a $10,000 investment

09:27.216 --> 09:29.292
in Raven's
life-coaching business.

09:29.311 --> 09:31.311
It went under.
Can't win 'em all, you know?

09:31.463 --> 09:33.146
I'm sure you were
under something.

09:33.298 --> 09:34.573
See, this is why people think
you're uptight.

09:34.724 --> 09:36.390
You have to stop calling me
a home-wrecker on TV.

09:36.484 --> 09:37.483
You screamed it,

09:37.836 --> 09:39.077
and you knew it was gonna
end up on television.

09:39.228 --> 09:40.653
And now my death threats
have doubled!

09:40.806 --> 09:41.805
You get death threats?

09:41.898 --> 09:42.897
Death threats
and hog shots, baby.

09:42.916 --> 09:43.973
Oh.

09:43.992 --> 09:45.141
Okay, don't tell your mom
about that.

09:45.160 --> 09:46.142
RAVEN: Look, can I give you
some advice?

09:46.235 --> 09:47.310
From a home-wrecker?
No, thank you.

09:47.403 --> 09:48.569
You know what?
I am finished here.

09:48.663 --> 09:50.571
I'm gonna find my lying,
cheating husband.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.924
-(Raven speaks indistinctly)
-Excuse me.

09:53.076 --> 09:55.168
MONICA:
Seven, eight, one.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.320
What's fun about this job
is getting a chance

09:57.413 --> 09:59.580
to bring out the best
in our dancers.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.434
Closer, Justin!
For the love of it, grab him!

10:02.585 --> 10:04.010
-Don't touch me!
-Simon, where's your eye line?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.845
-Anywhere but him!
-I said I'm sorry!

10:05.939 --> 10:07.088
Well, you're doing
great, boys!

10:07.107 --> 10:08.106
-Keep it up.
-Shut up, Wayne.

10:08.333 --> 10:09.274
They look like crap.

10:09.501 --> 10:11.443
(groans)
Okay, hi, quick question.

10:11.670 --> 10:14.337
Is your Prince supposed
to be a judgy closet case?

10:14.356 --> 10:16.764
Because if so, snaps for you,
great job on casting.

10:16.933 --> 10:18.358
-Really, Simon?
-What's going on here?

10:18.510 --> 10:20.118
Why do I feel like
I'm in couples therapy?

10:20.269 --> 10:22.120
Your Prince said
on camera,

10:22.197 --> 10:23.847
"That guy is ridiculous."

10:23.865 --> 10:24.956
Oh, my gosh.

10:25.108 --> 10:26.273
He called me ridiculous
on television!

10:26.368 --> 10:28.442
You are ridiculous!
We all are!

10:28.536 --> 10:31.129
We're grown adults
on a reality TV show.

10:31.356 --> 10:32.372
Now, where the hell is
your sister and my wizard?

10:32.524 --> 10:33.523
I think they're
shooting promos.

10:33.692 --> 10:34.782
(mockingly) I think they're
shooting promos.

10:34.918 --> 10:38.027
All right, let's just focus.
All eyes on me.

10:38.121 --> 10:40.546
PERSON:
Wayne, is that you?

10:40.699 --> 10:43.032
(chuckles)

10:43.051 --> 10:44.792
Neil?
Oh.

10:44.811 --> 10:45.977
Hi.

10:46.204 --> 10:47.646
-Long time, yeah.
-Yes.

10:47.873 --> 10:49.481
Yes, yes.

10:49.632 --> 10:51.391
Carry on.

10:51.543 --> 10:55.528
-Who's Neil?
-The devil incarnate.

10:59.567 --> 11:00.825
-(bell ringing)
-How did you find me?

11:00.977 --> 11:01.734
Okay, no shade,
you do nothing

11:01.887 --> 11:02.994
but post about this show.

11:03.221 --> 11:05.980
-Okay, why are you here?
-Oh, I didn't tell you?

11:05.999 --> 11:07.332
I'm scouting cities

11:07.559 --> 11:09.225
to open up a new line
of meditation juice spas

11:09.244 --> 11:11.227
tentatively called
Third Eye Rind.

11:11.246 --> 11:12.912
Anyway, I thought,
"Screw texting.

11:13.064 --> 11:14.747
I'll just go congratulate
Wayne in person."

11:14.900 --> 11:16.841
That's very thoughtful.
Thank you.

11:17.068 --> 11:20.512
This is a big deal.
We should celebrate.

11:20.663 --> 11:23.423
I know, I know, I know.
You're probably so busy.

11:23.575 --> 11:24.866
But...

11:24.926 --> 11:27.577
it's nice to see you.

11:27.595 --> 11:29.429
You look good.

11:29.581 --> 11:33.599
If you free up, let me know.
No pressure, seriously.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.010
(door closes)

11:36.029 --> 11:37.011
Do you have
a different choice?

11:37.105 --> 11:38.087
-PERSON: No, not yet.
-Okay.

11:38.106 --> 11:39.105
Dad, you already have, like,

11:39.257 --> 11:40.590
a million photos
of me on your phone.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.850
I know, and I want a fancy one
for my office--is that okay?

11:42.869 --> 11:45.019
Hey, I saw a video of that goal
you scored at State cup.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.429
You're getting
really good, Hen.

11:46.448 --> 11:47.764
I don't mean to brag,
but my kid's got a gift.

11:47.857 --> 11:50.283
Yeah, Mom offered to get me
into the soccer program

11:50.377 --> 11:51.025
at Manchester.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.618
It's pretty awesome.

11:52.771 --> 11:54.212
Well, I mean, it can't be that
awesome because everybody knows

11:54.414 --> 11:56.272
the best women's soccer
is here in the U.S.

11:56.441 --> 11:59.200
And I know that because I take
an interest in your interests.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.719
We're on the same page here.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.387
I could play
at a higher level over there.

12:02.538 --> 12:04.872
(British accent) And what, eat
crumpets and tea at halftime,

12:04.966 --> 12:06.299
while kicking the football?

12:06.393 --> 12:07.800
(normal voice) You could.
You could do that, I guess.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.302
But then you'd sound
ridiculous--what, Alan?

12:09.396 --> 12:11.137
I've got Zach Peterman
on Zoom.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.397
<i> Nick, great news.</i>

12:12.548 --> 12:14.232

12:37.332 --> 12:39.758
Go easy
on them thumbs, swiper!

12:39.909 --> 12:41.092
Dating apps are wild.

12:41.261 --> 12:44.320
They're like these video games
where you win self-esteem.

12:44.413 --> 12:46.990
I've been swiping on musicians.

12:47.008 --> 12:48.767
I even matched
with this baseball player,

12:48.918 --> 12:50.417
Aaron O'Reilly--
you know him?

12:50.495 --> 12:52.328
Yeah.
He plays for the Tigers.

12:52.421 --> 12:54.105
But be careful
with these athletes, Gabby.

12:54.332 --> 12:56.332
I mean, they'll swipe
on anybody just to--

12:56.425 --> 12:57.442
Oh, so I'm just anybody now.

12:57.593 --> 12:58.276
-No.
-That's fine.

12:58.427 --> 13:00.019
Not even you,
Reggie Sadler,

13:00.171 --> 13:01.112
can take away
the fact that I'm having

13:01.264 --> 13:02.338
a moment right now.

13:02.431 --> 13:04.340
This show has not only
gotten me a date

13:04.359 --> 13:06.600
but a frickin' date with
a frickin' baseball player!

13:06.694 --> 13:07.952
Wait, you guys are going
on a date already?

13:08.145 --> 13:09.195
He asked me out tonight,

13:09.347 --> 13:11.197
which is perfect
because my hair and makeup

13:11.349 --> 13:13.625
is looking fly as hell
right now from promos, so...

13:13.776 --> 13:18.021
(clears throat) Excuse us.
Glad I was here to save you.

13:18.039 --> 13:19.798
Right, yeah,
I have a date to make.

13:20.025 --> 13:22.783
But you all have fun.

13:22.861 --> 13:27.864
<i> ♪ </i>

13:27.882 --> 13:29.808
You guys made quite the feast.

13:29.993 --> 13:32.310
-Oh, it's all Patrick.
-Hmm.

13:32.461 --> 13:34.312
Paige, you have
an impressive book collection.

13:34.539 --> 13:36.981
I admit, I only ready
cheesy crime novels.

13:37.133 --> 13:38.983
I love the
Detective Humphrey series.

13:39.210 --> 13:41.152
Me too!
Because he's a detective...

13:41.229 --> 13:43.137
BOTH: And a fisherman.

13:43.231 --> 13:45.306
But we knew that
about each other.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.883
Patrick and I both love wine.

13:46.901 --> 13:47.826
-Yeah.
-Right, babe?

13:47.977 --> 13:50.236
-We're terrible.
-(laughter)

13:50.388 --> 13:55.834
So, Paula, what drew you
to my Mike--I mean--Mike?

13:55.910 --> 13:57.151
We met on set.

13:57.320 --> 13:58.578
PAIGE:
And then what?

13:58.672 --> 14:00.079
And then...

14:00.173 --> 14:02.323
he's handsome
and funny.

14:02.491 --> 14:04.175
(both chuckle)

14:04.327 --> 14:07.904
And he saved me from bees.

14:07.997 --> 14:09.697
-From bees, what?
-Yeah.

14:09.699 --> 14:11.908
No, from, mm, hornets.

14:12.077 --> 14:13.500
-Hornets.
-Mur--murder hornets.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.836
I'm sorry, there's murder
hornets here in the Midwest?

14:16.005 --> 14:17.080
That is not good.

14:17.173 --> 14:18.189
Wait, Mike saved you?
He did that?

14:18.341 --> 14:19.357
Yeah, during the audition.

14:19.508 --> 14:21.192
PATRICK: You had hornets
in the audition?

14:21.419 --> 14:23.344
Yeah, but, you know,
it's a boring story.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.921
We don't need to get into that.

14:25.014 --> 14:25.846
I don't think that
it's boring at all.

14:25.907 --> 14:26.923
I would love to hear it.

14:26.941 --> 14:29.258
-You would?
-Mm-hmm.

14:29.352 --> 14:30.218
Okay.

14:30.278 --> 14:33.946
Okay, think best friends.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.264
15 minutes,
and then I'm out.

14:35.358 --> 14:36.449
Fine by me.
I have a dinner.

14:36.601 --> 14:37.600
With your deranged ex?

14:37.619 --> 14:39.268
WAYNE: Why do you care
if I see Neil?

14:39.287 --> 14:40.545
Oh, is this your roid rage?

14:40.696 --> 14:42.772
He's a nutcase, Wayne,
and nutcase is your kryptonite.

14:42.790 --> 14:44.215
People change.

14:44.367 --> 14:46.125
Besides, I've been meaning
to make an amends to him.

14:46.277 --> 14:47.534
That's an insane excuse!

14:47.554 --> 14:49.220
You know he's bad
for your mental health.

14:49.372 --> 14:50.446
Smile, we're having fun.

14:50.581 --> 14:52.223
You want
to talk mental health?

14:52.375 --> 14:55.618
Look at you, you're not dancing
to help Justin.

14:55.637 --> 14:57.453
You're dancing to prove
to yourself that you still can!

14:57.546 --> 14:59.731
And you're going to drag
that poor kid down with you.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.808
I'm preventing him from
looking like an idiot onstage!

15:02.961 --> 15:03.884
That knee of yours is nothing

15:03.904 --> 15:05.294
but a Frankenstein glob
of drugs.

15:05.313 --> 15:06.237
(gasps)

15:06.464 --> 15:08.072
Again, theme here
is best friends.

15:08.224 --> 15:09.649
I'm done.
I have a show to save, Wayne.

15:09.743 --> 15:13.152
I don't also have time
to save your ass tonight, okay?

15:13.304 --> 15:14.820
Fine by me because
I don't need saving!

15:14.897 --> 15:15.914
Enjoy your psychopath!

15:16.065 --> 15:18.583
Enjoy your painkillers!

15:20.236 --> 15:22.145
-(sighs) You okay?
-I'm fine.

15:22.313 --> 15:24.313
-So what do you want to do?
-Let's go dance.

15:24.407 --> 15:26.499
Get out of our heads,
improvise a little.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.152
Seriously?

I was really sad, I think,

33:56.368 --> 33:58.184

too sad to dance.

33:58.387 --> 34:00.945

34:01.040 --> 34:05.525

met Kevin.

34:05.602 --> 34:09.621
