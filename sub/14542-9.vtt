- Kill them all for your mother.

was Patriot High Command.

21:48.760 --> 21:50.034
Of course.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.759
Seem a little quiet to you?

22:38.760 --> 22:40.159
The Patriots are gone.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.073
They must have found Aaron.

22:44.880 --> 22:46.553
They went this way.

22:53.360 --> 22:54.589
Hey.

22:56.080 --> 22:58.230
Cyn, hi.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.120
We're gonna
get out of here, okay?

23:06.240 --> 23:08.311
No. Don't go.

23:08.440 --> 23:10.636
- Not yet.
- All right, well, come with us.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.314
But we got to get as far away
from here as we can.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.153
I need to talk to you.

23:15.320 --> 23:16.549
Kid, I am sorry.

23:16.680 --> 23:18.512
I don't have time
for a chat right now.

23:18.640 --> 23:20.995
Aaron, who are you talking to?

23:21.120 --> 23:22.190
The kid.

23:27.680 --> 23:28.909
What kid?

23:31.720 --> 23:33.313
The one standing right there.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.710
Aaron, there's nobody there.

23:44.320 --> 23:46.709
We fixed her.
We brought you back to life.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.673
We just wanna talk.

24:00.040 --> 24:01.678
- Aaron, stop!
- We're leaving.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.199
- You saw a kid?
- I didn't see anything.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.237
Aaron, tell me!

24:09.160 --> 24:10.389
I saw a boy.

24:12.520 --> 24:14.716
And he said he brought me
back to life.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.152
And he said
he wanted to talk to me.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.155
Go talk to him.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.194
Wait, what?

24:27.360 --> 24:30.955
Look, these last few weeks
have been truly awful.

24:31.920 --> 24:34.912
But I still think...
I have to believe

24:35.040 --> 24:37.998
that everything happens
for a reason, even this.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.117
And you need to face it.

24:43.560 --> 24:45.073
I don't think I can.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.918
I'm scared, too.

24:47.920 --> 24:51.436
But you are gonna go back in there,

24:51.560 --> 24:53.471
and I'm gonna be right beside you.

24:59.600 --> 25:02.035
You're crazier than I am.

25:02.160 --> 25:03.753
That's why you love me.

25:15.520 --> 25:18.319
When I saw you on that platform,
I thought I was seeing a ghost.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.040
Tom, is...

25:24.440 --> 25:26.795
- ls Jason...?
- He's here.

25:28.480 --> 25:29.754
With me.

25:30.840 --> 25:32.035
Good.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.359
You wanna tell me what happened?

25:40.840 --> 25:45.073
Atlanta started to fall,
so I headed south with Theresa.

25:45.800 --> 25:49.191
We found a house in Sandersville.

25:49.680 --> 25:51.557
I was there when the bombs fell.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.269
Well...

25:57.640 --> 25:59.392
Thank God you're alive.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.354
Go ahead.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.355
Say it.

26:07.840 --> 26:10.354
Who is this ass-clown you're with?

26:14.840 --> 26:16.274
He's my husband.

26:19.240 --> 26:21.311
I thought you were dead, Tom.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.112
I was scared, and I was hungry.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.038
And so marry him...

26:27.000 --> 26:29.276
...is what I had to do to survive.

26:31.080 --> 26:32.718
Do whatever it takes, right?

26:41.680 --> 26:43.193
What are you doing here?

26:43.360 --> 26:46.113
These are the son of a bitches
who dropped the bombs.

26:48.120 --> 26:50.077
I was on my way
to the White House

26:50.200 --> 26:52.874
to kill the president for you.

26:56.920 --> 26:58.194
I love you.

27:04.840 --> 27:07.798
You are not killing the president.

27:10.280 --> 27:14.399
You're gonna keep your job,
and for now,

27:14.560 --> 27:17.029
both of us are gonna keep
our mouths shut.

27:20.400 --> 27:21.720
What do you have in mind?

27:24.440 --> 27:27.432
We can still get everything
we wanted.

27:41.680 --> 27:42.875
Hello.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.359
I thought you looked familiar.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.838
You're Kevin Donegan.

28:07.640 --> 28:10.234
My friend from... third grade?

28:11.120 --> 28:12.952
You played Nintendo with Kevin.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.155

28:16.880 --> 28:18.200
How do you know about that?

28:20.000 --> 28:21.559
We're everywhere.

28:21.720 --> 28:23.358
We're in the air,
we're in your head.

28:23.480 --> 28:26.393
- We know your thinks.
- My thinks?

28:32.880 --> 28:34.712
You're the nanotech, aren't you?

28:39.480 --> 28:41.118
So what are you telling me?

28:41.280 --> 28:44.193
That you're some sort of A.l.?

28:44.320 --> 28:45.674
That you're alive?

28:47.800 --> 28:49.359
How?

28:49.480 --> 28:52.199
We woke up. You woke us up.

29:02.840 --> 29:04.399
What if we end the world?

29:04.520 --> 29:07.831
We won't, Aaron. Do it.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.798
(THUNDER CRASHING)

29:24.240 --> 29:25.833

29:25.960 --> 29:27.553

29:28.520 --> 29:30.033

...but never an A.l. Haley Joel.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.389
What is this all about?
What do you want from me?

29:39.440 --> 29:42.353
Have you ever been
to Spring City, Oklahoma?

29:42.480 --> 29:44.153
It has the second biggest
ball of twine in the world.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.430
No. No riddles.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.676
What is he saying?

29:48.800 --> 29:52.680
I almost went nuts over this,
and I want some answers.

29:52.800 --> 29:54.359
I want straight answers.

29:54.520 --> 29:56.750
Why did you bring me back to life?

29:56.880 --> 30:01.238
Why did you knock us out
and sleepwalk us over here?

30:01.400 --> 30:03.232
What is this all for?

30:03.400 --> 30:04.879
You made us.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.797
We just wanted
to help you, that's all.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.037
Burning people alive?
That helps me?

30:11.200 --> 30:14.556
You say "kill" in your head,
so we kill.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.711
Just because
I think it doesn't mean...

30:18.280 --> 30:21.238
Look, stop killing people.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.031
You wanna help me?

30:25.160 --> 30:28.152
You leave me alone.
Do you understand?

30:29.240 --> 30:30.310
Go away.

30:33.760 --> 30:34.750
Go.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.074
She's a little turned around.

31:20.320 --> 31:21.833
Can you help her get back
to her husband?

31:28.280 --> 31:29.270
Sir.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.556
- Follow me, Mrs. Doyle.
- Thank you.

You gotta go.

34:04.320 --> 34:06.118
Well, we kind of had our hands full.

34:06.240 --> 34:10.120
- I could've helped.
- Your dad could've helped.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.438
All you can do
is act like an idiot,

34:12.560 --> 34:14.312

34:14.480 --> 34:15.879
Get out of here. You gotta go.
