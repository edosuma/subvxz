I don't know. What do you wanna do?

01:12.489 --> 01:14.032
-[door slams]
-I don't know.

01:14.115 --> 01:17.577
Say, fellers, have you seen my sunglasses?

01:17.660 --> 01:20.747
-Shirt pocket.
-What do you know?

01:20.830 --> 01:23.917
Ah-hyuck! Wanted to take
a snooze in the hammock

01:24.000 --> 01:25.919
without my eyelids getting sunburned.

01:26.002 --> 01:28.880
Oof! Kinda dark. Ah-hyuck!

01:28.963 --> 01:32.634
You know, you could hide your report card
in your dad's shirt pocket

01:32.717 --> 01:34.302
and he'd never find it.

01:34.386 --> 01:39.683
-I'll alert the media.
-Hey! Don't touch that!

01:39.766 --> 01:43.436
Come back with my paper, hairball!

01:44.270 --> 01:46.731
So much for the high point of the day.

01:46.815 --> 01:49.192
-What do you want to do now?
-I don't know.

01:52.112 --> 01:55.156
Hm! Send them critters
to the salivatin' army.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.785
Can't even read the funny papers
without drool all over everything.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.787
What're you spuds up to?

02:00.870 --> 02:03.581
Uh... We're resting, sir.

02:03.665 --> 02:07.836
The fast life of the suburbs
has aged us before our times.

02:07.919 --> 02:11.339
Well, it just isn't right
for kids to be sitting around.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.425
You have to prepare to grow up

02:13.508 --> 02:16.845
and do manly stuff like me.

02:16.928 --> 02:20.306
Oh! Shall we go put our pajamas back on?

02:20.390 --> 02:22.100
Nah. You're dressed fine.

02:22.183 --> 02:24.310
It's your altitude you have to work on.

02:24.394 --> 02:28.148
Start thinking big city
instead of small town.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.066
-Yes, sir!
-Good.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.651
Now, I'm going back to bed.

02:31.735 --> 02:33.903
So whatever it is you decide to do,

02:33.987 --> 02:36.322
just sort of keep it quiet.

02:36.406 --> 02:39.325
Congratulate us, P.J. We're saved!

02:39.409 --> 02:40.577
Did I miss something?

02:40.660 --> 02:42.746
Wake up, peejster.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.749
Spoonerville's like the ultimate
vegetation zone, right?

02:45.832 --> 02:47.083
Totally beige.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.836
So we do what your dad told us

02:49.919 --> 02:53.465
and go get ourselves
some big city excitement.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.718
-Big city?
-All the way downtown!

02:56.801 --> 02:58.636
[P.J.] But that's really the big city!

02:58.720 --> 03:03.183
Which is exactly where your very
own father said to start thinking.

03:03.266 --> 03:06.770
But we can't go to the city alone,
Max. We're just kids.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.856
P.J., P.J., Peejster.

03:09.939 --> 03:12.025
Would mere children

03:12.108 --> 03:14.778
desire the sophisticated
pursuits of the big town,

03:14.861 --> 03:17.030
living on the cutting edge,
up all night dancing,

03:17.113 --> 03:19.866
every minute more awesome
than the one before?

03:19.949 --> 03:24.204
Uh, I refuse to answer
on the grounds of sounding like a wimp.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.539
[Max] Loaded hot dogs
from a street-vendor,

03:26.623 --> 03:29.376
egg rolls from Chinatown,
lasagna in little Italy,

03:29.459 --> 03:31.670
corned beef sandwiches, shish kebobs--

03:31.753 --> 03:34.422
Stop! I can't eat another bite!
OK, I'm in.

03:34.506 --> 03:36.174
But what are you gonna tell your dad?

03:36.257 --> 03:38.843
I'm gonna tell him exactly
what we're going to do.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.513
Wow! Won't he stop us?

03:41.638 --> 03:43.723
Not if he can't find the note.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.725
Why do I feel like I'm in my underwear

03:45.809 --> 03:47.227
at a school assembly?

03:48.853 --> 03:51.022
[mewing]

03:51.940 --> 03:54.442
[snoring]

04:15.255 --> 04:17.257
[screeching]

04:23.888 --> 04:24.764
Oh!

04:34.691 --> 04:35.734
Whew!

04:36.317 --> 04:37.610
Piece of cake.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.405
Big city, here we come.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.785
[P.J.] This is the big city?

04:45.869 --> 04:48.496
I thought you were talking
about the mall downtown.

04:48.580 --> 04:51.875
Mall? What can we learn
about real life at a mall?

04:51.958 --> 04:55.670
You can learn that being alive
is better than being dead.

04:55.754 --> 04:59.924
[coughing]

05:00.008 --> 05:03.928
You see, Peej? Even the air smells
different in the big city.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.431
More alive! More exciting!

05:06.514 --> 05:10.060
[P.J.] [couhgs] I'll let you know as soon
as I find some air to breathe.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.729
You have to enjoy this
while you have the chance, P.J.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.315
There's nothing we can't do if we want to.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.817
And nobody's gonna treat us
like little kids.

05:17.901 --> 05:20.570
Pne, two, three, find the pea.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.656
Big money's easy as A-B-C, what I mean?

05:23.740 --> 05:26.493
What do you say, young man?
Care to give it a whirl?

05:26.576 --> 05:28.912
-What'll we do?
-[man] Hot dogs!

05:28.995 --> 05:32.082
-Get your hot dogs right here!
-Sorry, Max.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.334
I can't think on an empty stomach.

05:34.376 --> 05:38.963
What's the matter, sonny? Daddy doesn't
let you play with the big boys?

05:39.047 --> 05:41.966
[stuttering] Who are you calling sonny?

05:43.468 --> 05:46.429
Why, you could turn that 5
in your pocket into 20,

05:46.513 --> 05:48.181
Even $200.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.684
Just remember which cup the pea is under.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.102
That's easy.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.021
[chuckles] Yes.

05:56.439 --> 05:59.025
[Pete] What do you mean,
you don't know where my kid is?

05:59.109 --> 06:01.319
Why should I know where your kid is?

06:01.403 --> 06:04.948
'Cause your kid's always
gettin' my kid in trouble.

06:05.031 --> 06:08.952
How can my kid be getting your kid
in trouble when they aren't even here?

06:09.035 --> 06:11.371
Ooh, it's happening again, Goof.

06:11.454 --> 06:14.040
You're tryin' to make sense,
and I'm gettin' a headache!

06:14.124 --> 06:17.252
-Now where's my kid?
-Relax, Petey!

06:17.335 --> 06:20.672
If the boys were goin' off on their own,
they'd have told us.

06:20.755 --> 06:24.509
What the-- Who turned off the lights?

06:24.592 --> 06:25.760
Hold still.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.846
It's from the boys.

06:27.929 --> 06:31.307
-Well, well, what's it say? What's it say?
-They went downtown.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.144
I told ya when you were telling me
that they'd tell us

06:34.227 --> 06:36.855
if they did something
that needed tellin' about, didn't I?

06:36.938 --> 06:40.984
OK, OK, so you're right
for once in your life.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.069
That's only one in a row, ya know.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.488
I knew we could trust those little guys.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.158
-Downtown?
-Downtown?

06:48.241 --> 06:50.368
But there's weirdos downtown!

06:50.452 --> 06:54.039
And killer bees, and people wearin'
neo-post modern fashions!

06:54.122 --> 06:57.459
And crocogators in the sewers,
and all sorts of icky stuff like that!

06:57.542 --> 07:01.212
When I get hold of the spud
that gave them the idea

07:01.296 --> 07:06.134
to go downtown, I'll pulverize 'im.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.762
They say it was your idea,

07:08.845 --> 07:10.597
so they thought it'd be okey-dokey.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.016
Oh. Never mind that now!

07:13.099 --> 07:15.518
We gotta save our sons from civilization!

07:15.602 --> 07:17.437
Ow!

07:19.147 --> 07:21.775
Oh, man, I'm broke.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.610
[siren wailing]

07:23.693 --> 07:26.029
[chuckles] Yeah, well, tough luck!

07:26.112 --> 07:27.697
Ciao, laddybug.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.368
Come on, let's scarf.

07:31.451 --> 07:35.705
Hey, relax, Max, you'll feel better
after you get something to eat.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.957
[sighs] Yeah.

07:40.919 --> 07:41.961
[screaming]

07:42.045 --> 07:44.506
-Help!
-Yaah!

07:44.589 --> 07:45.924
What happened?

07:46.007 --> 07:49.344
P.J., relax. You can buy another hot dog.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.346
I don't have any more money.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.806
Can I bum some off you?

07:52.889 --> 07:56.059
I blew all mine on a lousy investment.

[both sigh]

07:59.062 --> 08:00.647
[horns honking]

08:00.730 --> 08:03.775
We seem to be stuck, Petey.

08:03.858 --> 08:06.653
Hey! Why don't we sing
while we're waitin'?

08:29.718 --> 08:32.303
I mean, we don't have money to call home

08:32.387 --> 08:35.098
if we could find a pay phone that works.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.767

All right! Yeah!

09:18.224 --> 09:21.269
-Hey!
-Give it back!

10:08.441 --> 10:11.444
Nothing a quick trip home wouldn't fix.

10:11.528 --> 10:15.073
Yeah, the educational
opportunities of the big city

10:15.156 --> 10:16.366
have worn pretty thin.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.120
I couldn't even hold onto that money.

10:20.203 --> 10:22.205
Look at it this way, Maxie.

get much worse, right?

morning's rush hour.

-Are you talking to me?
-Get us downtown and make it snappy!

10:49.149 --> 10:51.401
Don't mind him. He's a little upset

10:51.484 --> 10:53.903

11:28.104 --> 11:30.106
This is the big city.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.859
[Max] There's got to be
somewhere we can go.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.780
-Isn't there?
-Gosh, Maxie.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.366
Maybe we should find
a police officer, huh?

11:39.449 --> 11:43.036
I mean you could call our folks for us,
and we could go home.

11:43.119 --> 11:47.707
Yeah, but, well, I hate admitting
that this place is too much for us.

11:47.791 --> 11:50.919
